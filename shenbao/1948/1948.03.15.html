<h3>孫副主席談美國援華　軍事經濟應予並重　對憲法認須先實行始能再提修訂　改革幣制有待幣值穩定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕孫副主席科十四日晨接見記者，暢談國大任務，副總統競選及國際局勢等問題。關於本届國大，孫氏指出：其主要任務爲選舉總統·副總統，聞有人主張，在本屆大會中即可修改憲法，孫氏認爲不妥，因憲法之良窳，不能憑主觀決定，必須經過實行，始能提出修訂。孫氏對渠本人是否參加副總統競選事，未作正而否認，惟稱：「本人對副總統競選旣未積極展開活動，亦未明白宣布放棄，因爲在黨對這個問題，還沒有決定辦法以前，我個人不便有什麼表示。最近李宗仁先生來信，問我的態度，我這樣答覆他，外國記者來問我，我也是這樣答復他，國內各地朋友和國外華僑，紛紛來電詢問，我亦是這樣答復他們。」孫氏又含笑說：「我個人的主張和出處，向以國家的利害爲前提，到底國家最需要我什麽，我很願意由黨及民意來決定」。孫氏復强調稱：憲法上無明文規定副總統與立法院長不能由一人兼任，副總統無行政樅，與立法院長不衝突，美國副總統即兼任上院議長，其辦公室亦設於上院內，而我國所擬總統府組織法中，並副總統辦公室亦未爲之準備也。</p>
<p>孫氏繼論及美國援華問題，瑪認爲軍事援助與經濟援助應雙管齊下，東北及各地軍事失利情形，證明軍事方面須改革者甚多，故渠以爲可請美顧問協助我國訓練軍隊，以圖改革。軍需物資之援助，尤爲必要，部隊待遇應即時改善，帶兵官要須革除積習，與士卒同甘苦。經濟方面，我目前所需者，為穩定幣値，此爲第一要務，故美援之來，當以此爲目標，唯有幣値穩定後，始能談及改革幣制。</p>
<p>蘇企圖赤化世界　對日各會難樂觀</p>
<p>孫氏於論及東北問題時，就東北請願團所請强化對蘇外交，促蘇履行中蘇條約問題，表示此乃一國家實力問題，我以重大犧牲訂立中蘇條約，目的在謀取合作，以求內部安定，但迄未能換得蘇聯之友好合作，以目前情形論，即使政府進行敦促蘇聯履行中蘇條約，亦甚困難。孫氏稱：本人曾到過蘇聯，過去蘇聯爲求本身安全而擴張尙有限度，現則不僅防衛其本身安全，且有赤化世界企圖矣。孫氏因論及捷克問題謂：蘇聯策略爲能以軍事控制之國家，即造成共黨之統治，否則以政治手段成立聯合政府，等待機會，以求全面控制。捷克原係民主自由國家，圖與蘇友好，以謀獨立自主，經此次政變後，凡採此種政策者，其希望均已幻滅，西方局勢如此，東方局勢又何嘗不然。對日和會問題，爲我當前最關心者，如以蘇聯態度觀之，絕不容樂觀，將來國際情勢變化，我對日態度當亦隨之更改。</p>
<h3>洛陽白刃戰　國軍苦守核心　援軍兼程西進</h3>

<h3>四平浩劫市內大火　守軍逐屋苦戰寸土必爭　匪以人海戰術突破城防</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十四日電〕據空軍凌空視察，四平大火。此遼北交通樞紐，兩經浩刧，四平二字已名符其實矣！按：攻犯四平之匪爲一·二·三·七縱隊及北滿獨二·四兩師，西滿獨五師，約八萬餘，守軍步卒三千，浴血保衛後，至逐屋苦戰，寸土必爭，而後援不能及時趕至，犧牲過半，此喋血孤軍，於突圍中失却聯絡。〔本報瀋陽十四日電〕共匪陷四平後，其次一行動尙未判明，預料可能對長春作試探性攻擊。衆信國民大會未開會前，爲一重要階段，東北匪勢將以重創疲憊之師，作孤注一擲，威脅瀋陽，希圖混淆國際視聽。國軍針對匪之陰謀，已有萬全準備。〔中央社瀋陽十四日電〕圍攻四平之匪，十三日澈夜以步砲向市區全面猛犯城東北角之一面城，劉家屯，戰况至爲慘烈。匪冒我熾烈砲火，以戰車四輛掩護，反覆衝鋒，均經守軍先後擊退。又四平西南之屠宰塲及南門匪續增兵力，反覆衝鋒，守軍奮勇殺敵，展開極慘烈之肉搏爭奪，迄十四晨該陣地仍在國軍堅守中。（又電）竄入四平市區匪股，十二日雙方鏖戰竟夜，每一據點均經過激烈搏鬥，匪在我密熾火網下，不顧重大犧牲，以其所謂人海戰術，冒死猛犯，我軍奮勇作戰，尺地寸土，均收穫重大代價。嗣以城防工事悉遭突破，據點亦多毀於砲火。至十三晨，雙方乃開始短兵相接，展開壯烈肉搏，現已陷入混戰狀態。按共匪自於遼河兩岸被擊回竄遼北地區後，糾合殘股共七個縱隊以上兵力，於本月三日開始向四平進犯，我軍堅守孤城軍匪，於城防工事之外，忠勇奮戰，歷時十一畫夜，迭挫匪鋒，嗣因匪一再增援，至十二日，繼以戰車衝鋒，並於四週調來高射砲多門，以抵抗我空軍，其重砲數十門則向我市區猛轟，此遼北大穀倉之四平市區，遂繼去夏之後再慘遭共匪砲火洗禮。</p>

<p>〔本報桂林十三日電〕宋子文十三日晨八時在桂歡迎會上首次對兩廣民衆訓話（訓詞同時分電穗·港兩地公布）堅決表示在軍事。政治方面不惜任何犧牲，肅淸兩廣匪共。經濟方面以全力建設兩廣，兩廣一家，望兩廣通力合作，會後即在省府召集省府各部門首要會議，徵詢關於兩廣合作意見，省方向宋氏要求三點：（一）發展廣西金融，（二）合兩廣武力，聯剿兩廣邊匪患（由粤接濟槍彈）疎濬西江，展修湘桂路至粵三水與廣三路相接，該計劃用費請宋氏協助千八百億，宋氏已允儘量協助，刻具體計劃正由有關方面草擬呈核。宋氏下午四時招待記者，報吿西南現狀，謂西南匪患不足慮，現粤境匪共七八千，我團隊由十五團增至廿團，至桂越邊境匪患，現已與對方會商聯剿，本年內西南匪不難肅淸。經濟方面，渠主統一開發西南經濟，首注重海南島建設，擬以科學器械，仿日人時方法，發展該島礦產，蔗糖，漁業。廣西礦藏豐富，渠擬全力開採，以振興廣西工業，對桂省要求恢復梧州海關，以裕收入一節，渠亦予考慮</p>
<h3>美國徒然無益的對華政策</h3>
<p>〔美國人在中國的最後關頭」一書著者島特萊女士，本月七日在「舊金山審査報」上發表的專論</p>
<p>好幾個月來，國會中的共和黨議員一直在主張積極援華。以勃里奇參議員爲例，他就這樣說過：「假如在歐洲用去數十億美元去阻止共產主義的蔓延，而同時我國政府却因循坐誤任令中國落入共產黨的手中去，這使援歐也無意義可言」。</p>
<p>現在，杜魯門總統最後已經建議以五億七千萬美元給予中國了。</p>
<p>但是這筆由美國納稅人捐出來的錢，並不是用來阻止共產黨的，亦非用來以供建設之用。</p>
<p>照杜魯門總統致國會的咨文中所說，這是用作救濟的。他建議這筆款項幾乎應該完全用於由中國輸入糧食·棉花·石油·烟草和其他商品。其中極小的一個數目，即六千萬美元，是准其用於建設的，但是給予的中國軍火却根本沒有。</p>
<p>所謂「塡鼠洞」的行爲，我們想像不出比這種作爲更好的例子了。</p>
<p>當此中國人民的迫切需要是「安全」之時，把幾億美元的救濟傾注到中國去，究竟有什麽用處？</p>
<p>以賑濟的辦法使少數中國人苟延幾個月的時間，而對於中國共產黨軍隊所繼續破壞鐵路綫，炸毁工廠和礦區，以及驅使不可勝計的農民和工人，到國民政府治下的領土上來成爲難民的辦法，使更多更多的人民失業，貧困和流離失所，却一點不設法予以阻止，我們不知道這種辦法，究竟有什麽用處？</p>
<p>我們不得不懷疑杜魯門總統和馬歇爾國務卿在被迫對國會的援華要求讓步之時，依然決心不帮助中國國民政府去撲滅由莫斯科鼓動和協助的共產黨叛變。</p>
<p>建議中的對華五億七千萬美元的援助，看上去差不多像對國會的一種賄賂，藉以保證歐洲復典計劃的獲得通過，後者在政府看來似乎是最關重要的。</p>
<p>要帮助歐洲復興而不同時保證防禦蘇聯的侵略，共徒勞無功當然也是很明顯的。但是，至少在希臘方面，除了救濟之外，還供給着軍火和軍事上的指導。</p>
<p>二月十六日，也就是杜魯門總統就中國問題發表意見的前兩天，他就要求以更多的金錢作爲對希臘的軍事援助。他說：「希臘受着共產黨少數黨不斷增加的壓力，該黨順從外國勢力而獲得它的支持，正設以武力的辦法將該黨的意志硬加到希臘人民頭上去」。</p>
<p>這個聲明的每一個字，對於中國也是同樣適用的。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統還說過：共產黨「故意破壞希臘的村莊，肆無忌憚」，決心以「無情的破壞」來「使人民無家可歸，背鄕離井，迫使他們擁擠到城市中去，而使國家本來已經太重的負担更其加重，故意要造成悽慘和艱難的條件，希望借此使他們發動政治上的騷動」。這種說法，對中國也同樣適用。</p>
<p>那麼爲什麽政府在希臘和中國採取相反的政策？</p>
<p>為什麼馬歇爾將軍於一九四七年出任國務卿的時候，以四億美元給予希臘人去阻止共產黨，而並不以類似的數額給予中國，以待共產黨的深入？</p>
<p>爲什麽在我們於歐洲方面獲得這種經驗之後，馬歇爾將軍於一九四七年一月七日還是把「坦白聲明與中國共產黨在政府中合作不能設想，唯有武力政策可以解決問題」的中國人，納入「反動份子」的一類？</p>
<p>馬歇爾將軍以國務鄉身份和蘇聯交往之中所獲的經驗，是否已經知道中國人的想法是對的？</p>
<p>假如是如此，那麽他爲什麽不撤回他的聲明？</p>
<p>現在是難以相信任何人，甚至國務院的遠東司，還會以為中國的共產黨和希臘以及其他各國的共產黨不同，並不是「眞正的」共產黨，而是一批無害的，自由主義的農村改革家的了！」</p>
<p>這個秘密，是由中國共產黨本身加以揭發的，因爲他們每天在痛駡「美國帝國主義」，恢復了「淸算」地主和一切反抗他們的農民的舊政策（這個政策在抗日戰爭期間曾予放棄）焚燬敎堂敎會以及宣佈了百分之一百，依附莫斯科。</p>
<p>現在國務院是否祇爲了「面子關係」而不肯承認？</p>
<p>是不是國務卿和杜魯門總統不肯承認遺派馬歇爾將軍赴華，迫使中國政府和共產黨分掌政權的政策，是何等錯誤而有害？</p>

<h3>冷眼看冷戰　——歐洲十六國會議開幕——</h3>
<p>歐洲十六國的政治外交家業已雲集巴黎，當定於本日舉行會議，商討歐洲復興計劃：同時比京五國會議所商定的西歐聯盟盟的，亦將由五國外長簽字。當此歐洲兩極化日益明朗的今天，西歐各國的外交動態，自然格外値得我們的重視；尤其是這次十六國會議的成敗，不僅足以決定與會十六國未來的命運，而且馬歇爾國務卿的援歐計劃，也將視這次會議的結果如何而定。</p>
<p>當本文與讀者相見時，正是十六國會議開幕前的一刹那之間，我們對於這次十六國會議的結果如何？固然不能輕下斷語：但是放眼看看歐洲四週的環境，不僅是壁壘森嚴，鐵幕絨帳，把歐洲劃分爲東西兩個歐洲，已劃分得淸淸楚楚：而且最近又接連有驚心動魄的發展，頗有令人「一夕數驚」之感。就是站在大西洋另一邊的美國政治外交家，也在那裏心驚肉跳了。例如杜魯門總統對於歐洲最近的發展，率直表示其世界和平的信心已開始動搖：馬歇爾國務卿也謂世界現正在極大的危機之中；此在前國務卿貝爾納斯則大聲疾呼，竟稱世界的危機將至。從這些簡短的談話裏，實在可以看出歐洲危機的嚴重性。</p>
<p>自德日相繼投降大戰結束以來，至今僅二年又六個月；戰後世人英不憧憬着「天下一家」的理想，而期望列强以戰時駢肩作戰的精神締造戰後的世界和平：但是兩年來，不僅理想未能成爲事實，眞正的和平未能締成；而且兩大集團間的「冷戰」却愈演愈烈。到目前的今日，連這無聲無臭的「冷戰」也有演變爲流血流汗的「熱戰」之虞了。這種局勢的造成，我們雖不願責備某一方面，但是祗要把戰後兩年來的國際政治回顧一下，也就不難明瞭責任何在了。</p>
<p>嚴格的說，美蘇兩國，代表兩種根本不同的思想，再加以利害的處處衝突，希望她們通力合作締造世界和平，本來就是一種不能實現的幻想，不過世人受了戰爭的殘酷敎訓，終是希望她們能够共存並立，相安無事：詎意這最低限度的希望，到了去年的慕春，也就完全幻滅了。從那時起，雙方卽公開從事於「冷戰」，無不各用其極：我們站在第三者的立塲，看着雙方各施「法寳」，愈用愈奇，現在快要到「圖窮七首現」的階段了。</p>
<p>我們並不否認美國在這「冷戰」開始的階段，首先採取攻勢，例如杜魯門主義的倡導和馬歇爾計劃的宣佈，無一不可目爲美國反共的先聲；但是美國因爲是民主國家，不論是內政外交的措施，都要經過國會的討論與輿論的贊助；所以美國在行動上終不免失之遲緩，言行的不澈底，更是不足爲奇的；因此美國在對蘇冷戰中，反而着着落後。我們綜合美國所採取的措置有下列各項：（一）反共主張杜魯門主義的倡導；（二）馬歇爾計劃的進行；（三）西德三國佔領區的合併；（四）西歐聯盟的組成。以上四項步驟，在理論上都含有深刻的意義，但是在，實際上都難發揮其作用。尤其是前二項，迄今尙未具體化。</p>
<p>反之，看看另一方面所施的法寳，不但行動迅速，能够當機立斷，說到做到；而且針對對方所施的法寳，大有「道高一尺魔高一丈」的情形，每一行動的表現，無不令人驚心動魄。其中最惹人注意者有下列各項：（一）組織新共產國際，以反帝反美爲口號，阻制美援的進行；（二）與羅匈締結軍事互助條約：（三）鼓勵捷克政變，樹立共產政權，使歐洲的心臟也爲蘇聯所控制；（四）迫令芬蘭與其締結軍事互助條約，芬蘭爲大勢所迫，對於蘇聯也只有唯命是從。由此可知，蘇聯在東歐的鐵幕，不僅根深蒂固，而且其勢力日見鞏固，牢不可破了。使人人感覺到，蘇聯在冷戰中，着着佔先，咄咄迫人。</p>
<p>或謂蘇聯在東歐的行動，將引起美國的嚴重反饗，美國勢必加緊進行其援歐計劃及鼓勵西歐各國組織聯盟以希對抗；但是在目前的情勢之下，西歐聯盟的締結以及這次十六國會議的舉行，不僅不足以對抗蘇聯在東歐的行動，抑且適足以促成蘇聯對於北歐的瑞典挪威與東歐的希臘土耳其採取新的行動。這幾天來，謠言傳遍了歐洲，不是說蘇聯將有所行動以威脅希土法義四國，就是說蘇聯已要求挪威締結互助條約。目前雖可謂謠言不足爲信，但誰能保證這些謠言不會成爲事實？</p>
<p>我們要正吿全世界的人士，對於目前的世界局勢，應卽提高警覺，我們並不欲危言聳聰，但是事實已證明局勢的嚴重性，已不容忽視，尤其不要忘了，目前的局勢以視一九三八年慕尼黑會議後，更要嚴重。那時的侵略者納粹德國，僅能控制奧國及捷克的一部份，而東歐各國例如波蘭·羅馬尼亞·匈牙利·南斯拉夫等均與英法訂有互助條約，何况更東還有一個「第三方面」的勢力。但是時至今日，蘇聯除擁有東歐九國而外，並有德奧的一部份。不論以人力物力以及地理地位而論，蘇聯在今日的歐洲，已金湯之固，堅不可援了。西歐五國締盟豈能阻止其繼續向西發展！一般歷史學家，每論及第二次大戰爆發的原因，無不歸咎於民主國家對侵略者採取綏靖政策，這個錯誤雖已獲得補救，但已償付無數血的代價，今後不容再蹈歷史上的覆轍。但願對世界和平負有重責的美國當局，從速採取有效措施，以挽世界的狂瀾於未倒！當此歐洲十六國政治外交家雲集巴黎之際，美國朝野對於現行外交政策，應先自我檢討，速定挽回國際逆流的大計。</p>

<h3>美援歐復興計劃　參院通過移眾院</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕美參院十三日以壓倒之多數，通過歐洲復興計劃，以支持西歐而防止共產主義及混亂。美國歷史上最巨大之承平時期對外經濟計劃，於十三日晚之參院瀾夜特別會議中，以六十九對十七票通過而完成其第一次立法手續。該案現已交付衆院，預料於四月初可獲通過。該法案授權政府以五十三億元之貨物及金錢給予十六個西歐國家，金錢之總數則將於日後再行撥給。參院之通過該法案，適在國務卿馬歇爾及杜魯門警告之後，按兩人種共產黨在歐洲之新壓力業已使國際局勢惡化。傳行政當局正在考慮軍事準備新計劃，希望藉此能制止共產黨在歐洲之進展。歐洲復興計劃已遭遇國際共產情報局之反對，該局已宣佈擬加以阻撓之。此次參院之通過該案，巧爲參院主席范登堡之勝利。范氏獲很兩黨有力之援助，領導議員將三十餘名共和黨「修正派」削减及重新草擬整個計劃之主張擊敗。范氏稱，一部份西歐國家現仍在鐵幕之外，援歐計劃乃美國實踐諾言而繼續支　其民主機構及促進經濟復興。十三日晚所通過之歐洲援助案，與杜魯門送交國會之原議案，基本上無甚出入。一獨立之行政官將主持此一計劃，并由國會設置「監督委員會」以審查其工作之進行。美且國將委派「無定所大使」與參加各國聯絡。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕歷史上創舉五十三億元援歐法案，昨經參院表決通過，該案規定第一年度救濟事宜須自下月一日起實行。衆院方面亦可望加以通過，惟有減少經費及與經濟援華案合併討論之趨勢。參衆兩院通過後，實際撥款法案尙待提出。衆院外委會已決定將援外事宜併成一案辦理，該案內容則分經濟援助及軍事援助兩部份，經濟援助以西歐十六國及中國爲對象，軍事援助則以中國，希臘，土耳其爲對象，與參院所通過者如何調整，頗費周章。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕美參院昨晚在口頭表決中，否決一西方盟國對蘇軍事同盟之馬歇爾計劃修正案。此修正寒由共和黨參議員鮑爾提出者，渠呼籲「立即」向蘇聯攤牌，否則歐洲復興計劃僅能導入「失敗，破產，與戰爭」。</p>
<h3>小白宮召開秘密會議策劃軍事新戰略　武力為後盾制止蘇侵略</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕美國行政當局規正在積極考慮新軍事準備計劃，俾使蘇聯瞭解今後如再作侵略，將危及其本身也。官方稱，此項計劃已由杜魯門總統及內閣硏究中。彼等覺得美國有頒佈强硬外交政策之可能性，其中將說明稱，今後共產主義侵略將被認爲乃對國際和平及義大利安全之威脅。現尙在討論階段中之兩項雙管齊下之動議若被批准，即將實行，以防止義大利發生可能之共黨政變。美國將向西歐國家保證，美國擬根據馬歇爾計劃在軍事上及經濟上支援彼等。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十三日電〕美國聯合參謀部週末與國防部長福萊斯特，在距離華盛頓一千二百哩之遙佛洛里達州西鑰海軍基地，舉行秘密會議，該地即杜魯門總統休假之處，故有「小白宮」之號。美國軍事領袖所討論者爲陸海空軍在未來戰爭中之任務，一般相信此會雖與歐洲最近之發展無關，然國際局勢之緊張，已引起國會之加緊批評聯合參謀部之未能擬具三軍之共同作戰計劃。西鑰會議之結果，可使軍事領袖對於每一戰鬥部隊在戰略計劃中所擔任任務之歧見爲之消滅，而產生具有充分彈性的計劃。據悉，最主要之困難，爲海軍與空軍對於長程作戰問題之衝突。空軍認爲遠程偵察及轟炸乃空軍之任務，故撥付海軍之此項費用應撥付空軍，而海軍則認空軍之任務，僅爲保護美國天空，在任何未來戰爭之初期階段中，應由海軍航空母艦之飛機擔任國境外之襲擊。再在政治方面，對於國防之意見亦未趨一致，杜魯門總統　一冉請國會批准普一遍軍訓制度，使陸海軍將有大批後備兵，而參議員塔虎特則主張美國之國防，應建築在異常强大之空軍上，至於海軍及步兵數量不妨减少。</p>
<h3>援歐復興計劃大綱</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美參院所通過之歐洲復興計劃之大綱如下：</p>
<p>「目的」重建西歐十六國及德西部之經濟穩定，增進西歐及美洲之貿易，最後恢復西歐工業國與東歐農業國間之商業關係。</p>
<p>「方法」凡保體不絕努力以期復興之國家，美國應以貨品及協助給予之。在四年三個月內，美國將供給經濟建設亟需之主要物品，由於於歐洲無力以金元償付‘美國將立即貸予數項，並予以長期貸款。</p>
<p>「歷史」一九四七年六月五日，美國務卿馬歇爾在哈佛大學發表演說，初次建議此計劃。一月後，歐洲十六國代表在巴黎集議，起草復興需要之收支對照表，並保證合作。</p>
<p>「行政」復興行政部門將設置獨立官員一人，擁有閣員地位主持計劃，無定所大使一入，將與參加各國維繫連絡。國會將設一「監督」委會，檢察計劃之進行。　「美松款期限」該案建議成立爲期五十一月之計劃，如歐洲國家不能實踐諾言，或如歡洲情形改變使計劃不必要繼續，則國會或總統可取消此計劃。第一年之經費總額爲五十三億元，然詳定之基金必須由國會撥發，蓋五十一個總額之估計高達一百七十億元也。</p>
<p>「歐洲之保證」　受援國應揭　重建經濟及生產之「鵠國」，保證努力平衡通貨，减低貿易壁壘及合作全力生產。</p>
<h3>十六國會議前夕法礦工罷工</h3>
<p>據稱係由法共黨操縱</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十三日電〕十六國馬歇爾計劃會議，將於十五日在此間舉行，法國共產黨所操縱之總工會十三日夜打擊法國經濟，策動罷工或發出罷工成脅。北法煤礦區素有「共產溫床」之目，礦工三萬人已吿罷工，官方恐煤礦罷工展延及於金屬工業，然代表罷工工人一萬八千人之工會代表投票表決終止罷工，而於星期一復工。工會十三日會議時，此批代表將勸吿復工，工商部長拉柯斯脫稱，罷工「純爲政治性」。巴黎各旅館亦揚言有停工可能，工潮之發生正當十六國代表團冠蓋雲集，舉行談話，西歐之未來可能因此項談話而有重大之影響。</p>
<h3>法官方否認合併基爾城</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十三日電〕法外部發言人今日否認法國合併德境法軍佔領區基爾城之說，但承認該地幾全部爲斯特拉斯堡城方面越過萊因河之法國家族所居住。</p>
<h3>波拉爾抵海防保大抵香港</h3>
<p>二人將於達隆灣會晤</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內十四日電〕越南法高級專員波拉爾乘法艦拉格蘭德爾號赴海防業已於十三日抵達該港。在該艦傍海防港口時，法高級文武官員皆前往歡迎，在與若千海陸軍高級將領舉行短時之軍事會議以後，波拉爾即視察海防市區，波拉爾將於十四日赴達隆灣，法巡洋艦杜蓋托魯因號即停泊該處。按此一軍艦即益波拉爾擇定作爲與越南遜王保大會晤之塲所。預料越南遜王保大將於本月十七日抵達河內。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港十四日電〕越南遜王保大偕同其堂弟及秘書等於十四日抵港，前往歡迎者有前越南總理及越南北圻及南圻之人民代表。</p>
<h3>西歐十六國二屆會議今日在巴黎揭幕</h3>
<p>英外相主席將發表重要演說</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十四日電〕第一屆十六國馬歇爾方案會議於星期一在此揭幕時，主席英外相貝文將發表重大的政策聲明。大陸諸國正以極度關切之心情，期待貝文之此一演說，彼等極願知悉英國經濟之未來，是否將與大陸樹立緊密聯繫。外交界人士皆認本屆會議議程之主要問題，爲使西德參加西歐經濟企劃之問題，此項建議乃英美法荷比盧在倫敦會商德國問題及比京五國會議之結果，將由本屆十六闕會議予以批准。</p>
<p>又悉，法代表團於徵求英代表團之同意後，將提出建議，規定處理馬歇爾方案下援助之十六國永久性機構的定義。據悉，法國之建議擬使該永久性機構根據十六國每一國之計劃，並參酌過去一年來十六國在自助方面的成就，及今後所獲之美援，擬具每年十六國之通盤經濟計劃。又據關係方面透露，葡代表團將在本屆大會動議使西班牙參加歐洲復興方案。</p>
<h3>將設永久性機構謀經濟切實合作</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十四日電〕西歐十六國會議，將以任命永久性經濟合作機構下之檢査員爲其最重要任務之一。此等檢査員之任務，爲調査受援國家使用援助物資之情形，向華盛頓提出週期性的報吿，彼等應査明援助物資均有適當的來路與出路。巴黎會議之最初兩三天，將舉行一般性的討論，其後與會專家即將開始研究：（一）代表十六國永久性合作機構之組織；（二）自去歲七月以來各與會國關於短期及長期援助方面的成就。英法代表團前赴其他十四國首都接洽，對前述兩點，殆已獲致初步協議，故料本届會議必能有順利的進展。惟關於任命檢査員之點，預料尙有若干困難，若干國家若瑞士等反對外國檢査員有權進入其國土，行使檢査及控制之權。由美官員監督援歐物資之輸送及使用之意見，顯然業已放棄，西歐政治家對於美國此等態度，頗表好感。關於自去歲七月以來十六國自助計劃進展之報吿，已由去歲第一届大會所設歐洲經濟合作委負會之秘書處擬就報吿草案，衹待本届大會審查即可。討論英法荷比盧五十年聯盟條約之後果，並不在本届大會議程之內，然五國條約之成立，對於十六國之加緊團結，必能有相當有用之貢獻。</p>
<h3>奧防共始終不懈　決不步捷克後塵</h3>
<p>〔路透社維也納十三日電〕奧地利總理斐格爾今日在此發表强力演說，强調奧地利決不步捷克之後塵。他說，捷克之發展，不啻對於奧國之嚴重警吿，不過共黨在奧國僅爲一「侏儒」政黨，未曾厠身政府或其他行政機構，而工會組織於過去一星期來，亦頗能保持安定。某一方面一再指責奧政府之參加馬歇爾方案，已將奧國出賣與西方。須知奧地利之處境正如父母離婚後的子女，一方面將其毆打，而另一方面則願意收容。奧國當然祗能投奔願意收容的一方。</p>
<h3>雷諾探險機飛抵洛杉磯</h3>
<p>修理完竣後返華工作</p>
<p>〔中央社洛杉磯十三日合衆電〕返美修理之雷諾「探險號」機，今由奧當上尉駕駛，自檀香山飛抵此間。此環球名飛行家稱，「探險號」在中途雖發生引擎漏油之事，但渠在長夜飛行中，並無困難發生。惟一不便者，即吾人有十三小時，不能吸烟，漏油原因，係由於東方地勤人員，誤以一百四十五度之辛烷汽油，加於該機油箱所致，該機平素所用者，爲一百度之汽油。奧氏稱：在飛機修理期間，渠將駕另一飛機赴紐約探望家人。然後再駕「探險號」中返華，爲雷諾導領之科學探險團工作。</p>
<h3>蘇軍事哲學已澈底改革</h3>
<p>軍隊完全由政治局掌握</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十三日電〕前任美國陸軍部蘇聯經濟司長雷　在本期「聯合國世界」雜誌撰文稱：「蘇聯的軍事哲學於一年前澈底改革，新軍事理論視軍隊爲整個思想戰策略之一種勸吿工具。保衛莫斯科列寗格勒英雄朱果夫上將因思想不同，以觸「政治上將」伏羅希洛夫與日丹諾夫等之忌，因而被黜。共黨與紅軍將領間暗鬥甚烈，軍人主張軍隊與黨脫離，軍隊機構應依傳統的軍事路綫樹立，着重於陸戰，專致於蘇聯祖國之保衛。此種理論之領導者朱果夫，擁護者爲少數職業軍人，包括空軍上將諾維柯夫在內。反對派認爲軍隊乃革命的政治工具，此派以現任軍政部長布爾加寗爲首腦，附和者爲羅谷索維斯基與庫尼夫兩上將等。兩派之爭執取決於史達林，史氏即將朱果夫等少數高級將領撤換。蘇聯軍隊之任務，依史達林所指示之路綫完全重訂。史達林稱紅軍有三大特色：第一，是解放農工脫離地主與資本家束縛的工具；第二，是蘇維埃聯邦人民間的共同軍隊；第三，且有國際字義精神，是世界革命的軍隊，是各國工人的軍隊。此種主義之實際戰略結果乃政治與戰爭之交替使用。此種戰爭並不山任何軍事機構指揮，而由最高政治機關之政治局指揮。蘇聯此刻或在將來之任何時期，不希望發生實彈戰爭，因實彈戰爭之爆發，證明蘇聯政治戰之　全失敗。</p>
<h3>英實行夏季時刻</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十三日電〕英國定十四日起，實行夏季時刻，在標準時間兩點鐘（上海十四日上午十時）將時鐘撥快一小時，其有效時間至十月底爲止。</p>
<h3>美政府已決定放棄瓦解日財閥經濟　認為過去計劃過分激烈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕消息靈通方面吿合衆社記者稱：國務院與軍部已決定放棄瓦解日本經濟獨估計劃，該方面力言，此非美國放棄解散日本之「過分經濟集中」如財閥團者之謂，而美國乃認爲原定之計劃實過分激烈也。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫五百人投阿軍作戰</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十三日電〕討論巴勒斯坦問題之中。美。蘇。法四強，獲悉南斯拉夫回敎徒五百名，已自南啓程赴巴勒斯坦，投效阿拉伯人作戰。據羅馬電台稱，阿爾巴尼亞人七十七名，南斯拉夫人廿名，克羅特人廿一名，自義搭輪投效阿拉伯軍，已抵達貝魯特。</p>
<h3>蘇對日戰俘　灌輸共產思想</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十四日電〕據居留西伯里亞俘虜集中營兩年餘之前每日新聞記者西村忠郞稱：日本投降後，日戰俘被運往蘇境者，逾一百萬人，並多係從事勞工及技術工作。西村頃於新星雜誌撰文，分析日本戰俘之政治敎育中稱：蘇聯認爲此百餘萬日本靑年，對其第四次五年計劃，爲重大之貢獻。西村詳細說明蘇聯對日本戰俘之敎育工作，並謂：一切思想敎育，均係基於增產之動機，一九四六年並發動「精銳部隊」及「靑年行動」運動，以促進勞工效率，此外更發動「民由化運動」，以增進戰俘之工作意志。蘇聯當局爭取信仰共產主義份子之運動，主要以廿餘歲少靑年爲對象，年齡稍長者，較易接受共產主義之僞裝，回國後即行剝去，靑年人難於接受共產主義，惟亦不易忘却，若干靑年已深信共產主義。</p>
<h3>美助土增強空軍　蘇對土將採取誘騙政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社安加拉十三日電〕美駐土軍事代表團空軍組組長霍格，今日抵此，美空軍專家卅人同行。根據杜魯門主義供給土耳其之第一批美機，將於四十八小時內自德西部運抵土耳其。美駕駛員於上述飛機到達後，將於土國上空試飛，然後移交土國駕駛員。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社安加拉十三日電〕最近卸任之捷駐土公使克拉柯夫斯基吿記者稱，緊接捷克之後，蘇聯第一個目標不在芬蘭而在土耳其。蘇新大使不久將來此，其任務即爲準備此項工作。據克氏稱，此新大使將採取誘騙政策，以遂其經濟侵略目的。</p>
<h3>印荷會談結束　傳並無結果　哈泰由城飛返日惹</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十三日電〕荷印副督范莫克與印尼共和國總理哈泰，在此舉行爲期兩日之政治會談，已於今日結東。會後未發表公報，然據共和國方面人士透露，開會並無結果。哈泰將十四日飛返日惹，與臨時國會外交委員會討論。哈泰今日晤畢范莫克後，並分別與英駐　城總領事孫浦赫及印度駐　城　領事拉格哈文晤談，聞印尼共和國亟盼印荷爭端能獲解決，使印尼之出口貿易得以恢復。哈泰與范莫克舉行之談判，係關於印尼共和國參加印尼臨時聯邦政府以準備組織印尼合衆國之事，討論項目包括臨時聯邦政府之外交關係，軍事合作，糧食分配，幣制統一，關稅控制及外匯等，荷蘭方面對於此次會談未曾表示任何意見。</p>

<p>〔合衆社普拉格十四日電〕普拉格電台頃廣播文吿：譴責智利之要求聯合國安理會調査捷克之政變。文告稱，「智利之法西斯黨徒去年毫無理由與捷克絕交，如果智利要求調査捷克政局，此乃傲慢之挑撥。」</p>

<h3>春季危機岌岌可慮　美蘇已迫近「攤牌」　美注意點今後集中義局勢</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕蘇聯共產主義之擴張勢力，與西方國家之團結力量，今春或將實行攤牌，美國及海外各國皆深以爲慮。美國自揭櫫杜魯門主義，以遏阻侵略性共產主義之蔓延迄今一載，已置身於二次世界大戰後最緊急之國際危機中，美蘇兩國將在近期作最後攤牌，殆爲勢所不免。杜魯門總統於去年三年十二日向國會宣布美國政策，必須支持反抗武裝少數派或外來壓力將其征服之自由民族，並請援助希臘土耳其，此無　要求蘇聯在中東止步。國會方面旋即通過以四億美元援助土耳其抵抗蘇聯之直接壓力，並支持希臘抵抗共黨之內部侵略，但此主義之作用，對於他國影響更大。其直接結果爲四强外長會議在莫斯科討論對德和約時之衝突。法國突然改變路綫，逐漸傾向西方國家，並表示不復畏蘇。全歐均發生反應，美國遂於最後決定不再作政治自由反蘇威脅之空泛演說，而欲實事求是。美官方希望杜魯門主義之宣言，再加上數億美金，即可阻止蘇聯，但其援助希土政策並未獲得成功。今日馬歇爾已請國會添撥二億七千五百萬元，延長軍事援助希土一年，此後或尙有其他請求亦未可知。去年六月西歐各國經濟崩潰，使美政府大起驚惶，馬歇爾允對合作自助之歐洲國家予以援助，由此產生所謂馬歇爾計劃，作爲阻止共產主義於混亂中蔓延之經濟屛障。今則英法比荷盧五國已成立協定，將請美國與以軍事保障，勢所必然。共黨之征服捷克及蘇聯對芬蘭之要求，顯已吿一段落，蘇聯戰後政策之全部現象，不論直接間接，實際上業已完成。問題則爲美官方是否煩擾，此後又將如何？蘇聯目前之行動，必將牽涉杜魯門主義所適用之國家，一般人所以深恐蘇聯共產主義之擴張勢力，今春將與西方國家實行攤牌者，殆即爲此。全美國注意之焦點，此時皆在義大利。四月十八日爲其普選之期，美國定將盡力减少共黨所獲之票數，使其不能起而秉政。美政府所用之方法是否可獲得成功，共黨是否將訴諸武力，皆爲問題中事。春季危機之岌岌可慮，已由此具見一斑。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕兵役協會抽籖委員會，昨日上午十時三刻在市參議會舉行成立大會，出席委員陸蔭初，童行白，趙君豪，周學湘，陳寳驊，侯雋人，趙仰雄及各區區長及區民代表會主席四十一人，張曉崧，雷可南，談益民，姚文瑛等均列席。潘主任委員公展主特開會，宣吿該會成立，並報吿數點：（一）去年徵兵三千名，尙缺五十七名，未能足額，今年應予補徵。（二）採取志願兵及抽籖辦法，二者兼施，志願兵可抵補兵額。（三）奉令於四月一日開徵，六月底徵足，一切抽籖工作，必須於本月底前完成。（四）採用間接抽籤辦法（見三月二日本報第四版）。抽籖委員會受現役及齡壯丁之託，責任重大，希望全體抽籖委員於抽籖實施之日，準時到會，協助並監督抽籖工作之進行。次由民政局長張曉崧致詞稱：本市今年第一次實施抽籖徵兵，廣聘各法團學校及各區長，區民代表會主席爲抽籖委員，愼重進仃。同時由於實行抽籖徵兵，牽涉及　壯丁達十七一萬人之多，故吾人推行役政絕對坦白公正。張氏至此宣布本市某區某保，在徵兵處理期間，禁止及齡壯丁申請遷出情形下，未經辦理申請手續，擅自核准壯丁遷出，顯有舞弊嫌疑，刻已派員前往澈査，如査出確有舞弊情事，決送請法院，以破壞役政治罪。今在此鄭重宣吿，對此輩罪犯，決不寬假。最後由民政局科長姚文瑛闡釋間接抽籖辦法甚詳，並當衆表演抽籤。旋即討論，經決定於二十三日下午二時在市參議會舉行抽籤。爲使各界對於此次徵兵意義及抽籖辦法獲得明確認識，並於舉行抽籤之前一日（即二十二日）上午九時，似皇后大戲院，舉行兵役　傳大會。最後各出席人士提出役政問題多項，均經張處長一一答復，至午散會。</p>

<h3>徐繼荘案一關係人　孫孝鈞在錫臥軌自殺　遺書三通謂恐成冤獄　自白僅受薪水未得彭徐好處</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十四日訊〕前中國郵政儲金匯業局局長徐繼莊貪汚案關係人孫孝鈞，畏罪不敢投案，前日自京返滬，中途在本邑下車臥軌自殺身死，身畔有絕命書，謂未獲徐等好處，投案恐成寃獄，語多激昂要凉。死者孫孝鈞，現年四十七歲，南京人，曾任軍委會運輸統計局液體燃料管理會專員等職。與徐繼莊相識後，即爲徐手下之紅客，執巴山銀行及遠東貿易公司之全權。去年徐繼莊會汚案發，由江蘇監察使署檢舉，復經上海地檢處迭經偵査，提起公訴，孫亦被列入被吿，從此棄職。惟孫之事業大都在滬，諾事均待親自料理，且妻周氏仍在郵匯局任職，子女等亦皆在滬求學，故孫旣不敢到案，又不願離滬，且孫平日之交遊甚廣，最近有孫之患難朋友，紛向要挾借貸，予取予求，孫有不勝其煩之苦，　加拒絕，又虞有入獄之危，在此種情形下，壓世之念，已非一日。十二日孫在京料理胞兄濟甫喪事後，即偕其外甥蔣慶裕由京乘夜車赴一滬，維時孫已有自殺之決心。過無一錫站時，夜黑人靜，孫悄然下車，乘由滬駛京列車經過時，將身臥伏於鐵道上，迨被人發覺，則已輾斃。時蔣慶裕已至蘇站，在車中遍尋不昆孝鈞，而見絕命書，知已生變，急以電話向錫站訊問，果已在錫自殺，當即來錫，會同圖正投報地檢處。屍妻周氏得電，亦趕奔來錫，買棺成殮。茲錄孫孝鈞絕命書如下：</p>
<p>臨死之言　激憤凄涼</p>
<p>遺書（一）華妹：我最親愛的賢妻，你知道我之慘死，自必悲哀，然而要知道人生總有一死，我命中有死殃，我又不善辯，且我神經心臟皆弱，投案後受詰或遭刑訊，自必不堪，或竟成寃獄，即使不然，以我僅受薪水，未得彭徐好處，除給你現職勞力取値外，因老實必成罪人，入獄三天，也必氣死，如高飛遠，也必悶死，且將永蒙不白，更不値得，况反而容林可能推陷我，由他擺佈，他的部份（彭爲主使）罪惡，亦非我爲，他曾以送金根一紙示我，送徐繼莊等，我與其氣悶而死，不如以武士道之精神，墜軌切腹而死，如此我靈可以升天，不入地獄，如此，我的妻兒家人，尙可為人，望我兒成為世界上之大科學家，要作利國救民之業，果耳，我有榮焉，死亦瞑目矣。餘孩尙幼，亦各有其成，三五兩房，子五女三，雖分彼此，希各互助。你辛苦所得薪餘，可商之大太爺，加入協號股，或可生活。郵匯局職，希勿被裁，能求得我職，及以後任意請調地點更好，如此，則安慰我上天堂去了，我的精神，將永遠隨護你，偎愛你，我原甚痛苦，現反快感，節哀順變，你的身體要緊，不必傷感自殘，我的即以四千　讓屋，我死是上天堂，非下地獄，你要遠觀，羊珠巷屋，請營林等念孤寡。遺書（二）榮林請再鑒：人之將死，其言也善，况我一生忠實不欺，言更無僞，我以埀死言善之人，特奉吿閣下，我家所存應移交而未能交（因無繼承者）之小箱內，僅「巴川」「遠洋」董監　章，及營業執照等文件，余妻不知究竟，請勿誤罪。遺書（三）岳母，大二母，哥哥姊姊手足，明知雖非親姊妹，亦猶骨肉，及各甥侄子女，你們均愛我，我死勿悲，望達觀，認我此去是天堂，自有安慰，我的孤寡，要請照應，別了！祝你健康，親友均不另。</p>

<h3>商業競爭日趨劇烈　路牌廣告突飛猛晉　空壁樓頂都成良好基地　二百平方尺價逾五千萬</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上海路牌廣吿數量的驚人，與製作技術的突飛猛晋，是今日商業競爭已趨白熱化的有力說明之　一。從「發售狗皮膏藥，專治鐵打損傷」的招貼開始，短短十餘年間，廣吿已經由壁角街頭伸展到每一個空間的罅隙。在商業家的眼光中，空白的牆壁，高得出奇的危樓，衝要的建築，以及引人注目的塲所，沒有一處不是他們作爲「廣吿戰」的良好基地。</p>
<p>這當中，南京路，靜安寺路，外灘，霞飛路，西藏路，因爲人烟稠密，當然是各商行公司爭逐最烈的廣吿地區，但也有匠心別具，捨棄都市而專就窮鄕僻壤的，像「白雪」廣吿大部偏散在曹家渡，五角塲，漕河涇一帶；「五洲固本皂」則在京滬沿綫樹立五萬尺廣吿路牌，深入了宜興，溧陽等縣。有的是企圖吸引都市羣衆，有的則是爭取農村顧客，地域雖殊，其欲廣招徠的則一。</p>
<p>寸壁之微　租金可觀</p>
<p>廣吿公司爲客戶在各地樹立廣吿路脾，並不是一件簡單易辦的事。雖一牆寸壁之微，首先須向地主承租，頂費租金，一如頂屋，在都市以金條美金論價，在鄕村即以米穀糧食計値；跟馬廳旁迤邐數里的廣吿路牌，廣吿公司按月向跑馬廳總會繳納極爲可觀的費用，仙樂斯舞廳兩旁引人入勝的草地廣吿，也向廣告商收取着鉅額的地租，還有很多居戶幸邀廣吿商埀靑，願假壁角一隅，以粉刷廣吿者，這位居戶每月的收益，可能較出租一幢房屋的租金數倍而有餘。</p>
<p>小窗四扇　減低風力</p>
<p>廣吿商最感恐懼的是突如其來的颱風，廣告路牌首當其衝，當然不堪一擊，過去每遇風暴，路牌常如斷梗　萍，連根被拔，損失不貲，現在他們想出了一個辦法，在路牌正中，　闢小窗四扇，平時　閉妥密，外觀天衣無縫，等到狂風一起，小門受震脫落，各窗豁然自開，風阻激减，浩刧可免。</p>
<p>廣吿商平時對市區內各地段下層人物以及幕後勢力的聯絡應付，也頗煞費苦心。廣吿路牌以美觀第一，最忌塗抹破壞，尤其夜間無人看守，防備更難週到，更難週到宵小乘隙竊盜，所以年節開銷，特別從豐，這種彼此心照不宣的交易方式，聽說倒頗收宏效。現在每塊二百平方尺的廣告路牌，價値達五千萬元以上，稍有差池，當然廣吿商即有賠累之虞了。</p>
<p>信筆繪製　毫釐不爽</p>
<p>廣吿路牌的生命是在圖案的繪製，繪製所用的油漆以德國出品最優，英貨較次，美國油漆色澤雖然鮮明，但病在不能持久，普通廣吿商與客戶訂立路牌，大致六月一期，除電影廣吿外，其餘很少更換，所以對耐久的色彩油漆就不能不有一番選擇。還有繪製圖案的工匠，他們並未受過任何美術訓練，一塊肥皂，一聽香烟，衹要在手中端詳一過，就能在百尺懸壁之上，小大由之，描繪得毫厘不爽。平時三四百尺的書面，着色十數種，費時不過僅二日，熟練的技巧使他們每乃能收穫四五千萬元以上的進益。</p>

<h3>魯省小康局面背後若干問題</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日航訊〕由於過去國軍的全力淸剿和劉伯承陳毅殘餘主力的相繼南竄華中，致使半年餘米作爲山東心臟的濟南，才能够維持了一個比較安定的小康局面。</p>
<p>在抗戰軍　前，濟南原僅有人口卅餘萬，勝利後，因共匪作難，烽烟遍全魯，於是各縣難民都向濟南，靑島等火城　擠，致就濟南：人口最高時達八十萬。自去秋膠濟路濟維段二度打通，緊接着於十二月津浦路徐濟段正式修復通車後，麕集在濟南　人們，雖已獲得部份　疏洩，但終以餘氛未靖，各鄕鎮廣大的面仍在土八路控制之中，因之全市的人口，除軍隊未計外，仍始終保持六十餘萬至七十萬的記錄。</p>
<p>「民以食爲天」，人口增加後最嚴重的課題自然是糧食問題據魯建廳統計：濟市共有麵粉廠七家，其生產能力如全部發揮時，每月可出麵粉七十萬袋，需小麥二十萬包，恰敷濟南全市之需，但目下因四鄕被共匪封鎖，麥子來源短少，僅月出四分之一，即十七萬餘袋，需小麥五萬包。此外，即連雜糧合併計算，目下由外縣輸入濟市的食糧平均每日不過三千包，合計月達九萬包，僅敷濟市現有人口三分之二的食用。（雜糧於磨成粉末時消耗甚少）。而濟市原有存糧雖無精確統計，但在如此供求情形下，糧食的高漲，自然是情理中事，計自去年十二月中旬五十萬一袋頭等麵（四十四市斤），到二月初旬（陰曆年底便突破了百萬大關，至三月初麵粉暗盤復一度上揚至一百八十萬一袋，目下雖盤旋在百五十萬左右，但這種價格，顯然是不能維持多久的。　再就雜糧中的小米麵說，現在的市價也已到了二百萬一百市斤。而據濟南市長王崇五吿訴我：全濟七十萬人口中，至少一半是難民，而此卅五萬難民中，又至少有廿萬要仰仗救濟來維持生活，難民們於離鄕背井時所僅能携帶的一些輕裝細軟，經不住兩年餘來的長期消耗，也大部份坐吃山空，面臨絕境。魯省府直屬曁附屬機關原有公敎人員共四千七百餘人，在如此高物似的重壓下本已奄奄一息，而在十二月份濟市物價指數據山東省銀行統計即已達十八萬餘倍，而中央則把濟南列人第三級，山東其他各縣列入第四級，僅靑島市列入第一級，這不僅使濟市公敎人員「活不得」，「死不得」，「生不得」，「病不得」，尤其是隨時冒着生命的危險在餘氛未靖的收復區服務的公敎人員所得的待遇是更低，低到不僅不能「養家」，連個人的「糊口」也成了問題，在這種情形下，欲談獎勵優秀有爲人員赴收復區與匪從事政治經濟文化敎育等各方面的競賽，難能可貴了。</p>
<p>在平時，政府駢枝機關層見疊出，一旦因政費浩繁，入不敷出，又不顧死活，統而括之，一個命令限令各地方政府於五個月內（二月至六月）要裁員百分之廿五。這在後方雖也一樣的成爲問題，但其問題應遠沒有綏靖區的深刻而嚴重，就拿濟南來說：難民和失業的本已够多，原有的公敎人員的待遇本已够苦，偏偏連這一點生機還要加以摧殘，被裁後的公務員事實上是沒有出處的，因此，這簡直使王兼主席傷足了腦筋，滿想不裁，但中央不管三七二十一，於二月份起就已開始扣發　有經費的百分之三十，致不得不於三月初起裁員百分之十。而其他軍事機關，（如綏區）及黨務機關亦同樣的要裁，尤其是黨務機關，被裁者竟達原有員工的百分之八十。</p>
<p>據最近由「解放區」逃出的人員吿訴我：共匪爲「减輕人民負祖，實行備荒救災，生產節約，保證土地改革，爭取自衛戰爭最後勝利」，特頒佈「禁令」八項，其中第三項是「停止擴軍，今後非經軍區，省府決定，不得再動員參軍」。他又吿訴我：『共匪於各「解放區」與國軍收復區的。交界綫上普設招待所，歡迎逃亡出來的難民重行還鄕，過去共匪對於地主階級是不准還鄕，還鄕是格殺不論的，但今年他的政策變了，地主還鄕，也可担保其生命的安全，仍按人口，每口發給一畝地，在開始的三個月，由匪每日供給食糧兩市斤，十天發一次，到期再傾』。他更鄭重的吿訴我：『距濟南只有卅華里，黄河北岸的桑梓店，共匪就設有大的招待所，特別强調歡迎政府被裁員工到「解放區」去，他們負責保證並保障他們的工作。』</p>
<p>同時在濟南，又不知多少中下級公務員和我這樣說過：『過去，我們每天　的是窩窩頭，啃窩窩頭的時候，我們尙可自喩爲「手托黄金堵」，獲得若干精神的滿足，今天即使一個家有五口委任一級的公務員，述啃窩窩頭也都成了問題了！』</p>
<p>這一迎串的問題絕非僅憑地方政府的力量所能解決的，假使中央再不針對綏靖區特殊環境，適應綏靖區特殊需要，切實提高工作人員待遇，獎掖大量優秀靑年至收復區與匪從事政治，經濟，文化，敎育等競賽，以達到「總體戰」的眞正使命，再不准許南糧北運，以裕糧源，並撥給大批食糧貸款，購糧運魯；將美國救濟食糧百二十萬噸，亦　給山東一部，藉以解救山東的嚴重春荒；再不停止裁員，與其裁後再予救濟，毋寗不裁以增强其工作效率；那末，人民爲了爭取最起碼的生存，便難免不飲酖止渴，爲共匪的片面宣傳所　惑。魯民廳長劉翔說得好：「即就裁員說：在別的地方至多是個社會問題，但在綏靖區，也成了嚴重的政治問題了。」（本報特派員麗天）</p>
<h3>轟動山東的婦女立委競選　糾紛告一段落</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十二日航訊〕山東婦女立委競選糾紛自發生後，已引起全國各地之普遍注意。現在由社會賢達參加競選得票甚多之魯敎廳長夫人陳久敬女士經王兼主席耀武等之勸讓，已表示放棄立委競選權，同時參加立委競選之中委兼參政員呂雲章對陳氏此舉，深表欽佩，茲將呂陳兩氏談話分錄於後，這一塲轟動山東的競選糾紛，至此當可吿一段落吧！</p>
<p>呂雲章談話余此次參加立委競選，其目的在取得立法院之發言地位，立委非官吏，乃人民代表，故競選立委，與其謂爲個人權利，毋寗謂爲人民盡義務，不幸因競選而得罪朋友，非常抱歉，又承各界人士協助，非常感激，頃聞陳久敬女士向王主席聲明放棄立委被選權，表示退讓，此種謙讓未遑之風度，不僅雲章個人非常欽佩，且爲山東社會與選舉前途留一良好之榜樣，雲章與久敬女士原係同學，友誼甚篤，此次競選所發生之誤會，因傳聞失實，發生隔膜，現經友人說明，雙方已渙然冰釋，決不致因一時之誤會，而影響吾兩人之友誼。</p>
<p>陳久敬談話頃閱本市各陳登載呂雲章女士談話一則，（按即上節所載）與事實經過多有不符，蓋本人此次參加競選，自始至終態度一致，並未因任何阻力稍有移易，旣決議競選何得放棄被選權，最近半月來，以選舉事，呂雲章女士不顧一切，在各報發表揑造事實之新聞，再在大華日報上刋登，所謂李楊氏之像片，企圖掩蓋其虛造之事實，淆惑聽聞，意在毀壞外子李泰　名　，侮辱本人個人人格，呂女士旣破壞友誼如斯，雖日前承王主席囑友好來調解，本人認爲在雙方未恢復友誼以前，絕不能談退讓問題，外子呈請辭職，擬以在野之身與呂女士周旋，復　王主席勸阻，故未便有任何其他表示，至於立委退讓問題，俟選舉結果公佈後，自易解決因呂女士旣爲本人老學長，如本人果能當選，退讓與彼，亦未嘗不可。</p>
<p>呂　章已於本月十二日晨搭津浦特快車赴京轉滬，醫治眼疾。又自本案發生後，李應長泰華於十日起即未到廳辦公，並已向王主席正式提出辭呈，但聞王主席以兩年來李氏在魯，建樹頗多，決予　留。（本報特派員　天）</p>

<h3>謝壽康演講　歐美文藝概況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市文藝作家協會，，上海美術會，文化運動委員會，及青年館等四團體，昨日敦請前任駐敎廷公使，現比國皇家文學會會員謝壽康氏演講，題爲「歐美文藝槪况」。謝氏略謂：第一次世界大戰以後，社會經濟恢復甚快，戰後文藝也如鮮花怒放，燦爛奪目。此次大戰後，則與前次相反。人民徬徨無所棲止，在苦悶中追求但對中國文藝，非常感覺興趣。現在舉世在窮荒中，除美國富有外，其他均不景氣，文藝作品，銷路亦成問題，可說荒蕪已沒有一點源泉；一部分人士，遂轉而望遼遠之遠東而羡慕，近來法國亦覺本國不能安居，想來中國。這種苦悶現象，到處皆是。中國惹起人注意，也是歐洲古文化亦受到中國之影響，如意大利文藝復興，近代法國文壞重要人物，皆曾受中國文學哲學之影響云。按謝氏於勝利後，因比國皇家文學會老會員鄧遮南去世，遺席公選謝氏担任，此亦中國在海外文藝界之一大榮譽。</p>

<h3>世運足球預選在港順利進行　代表隊下月十日出國　預先賽以爪華作對象</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕我國參與第十四屆倫敦世運足球選拔，中華全國體育協進會總幹事董守義，於本月五日偕世運足球選拔委員會主席委員容啓兆飛港，會同港地選拔委員辦理選拔事宜。茲悉董氏已於十一日由港搭機先行回滬，據董氏稱：此次選拔係由中華全國體育協進會港分會理事長蔡惠鴻會同有關方面合作辦理，成績異當美滿，參與選拔賽者，計有爪哇，九龍華聯，及星加坡選派之朱志成（守門），謝文良（右輔），於本月九·十一·十六三日，以爪哇爲主體，分別比賽三塲，星洲二代表插入華聯隊比賽，一俟十六日最後一塲預選完畢，世運足球隊代表人選，即可由全體選拔委員會決定，並定下月十日由港整裝出國。又悉董氏在港，曾與胡文虎父子數度協商足球隊出國事宜。</p>
<p>爪華在港大受歡迎</p>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕遴選世運足球代表，在香港正鬧得滿城風雨，董守義·容啓兆·余衡之抵港，爪哇球隊也由張懷金率領球員二十人來港，參加競選世運代表名額，爲了感謝爪哇隊歸國的熟情，（球員們的旅費都是拿出自己的積蓄來凑成的），因此博得廣大的歡迎，除了南華會招待他們住宿外，此間體協分會·南華·星島也分別設宴款待，私人也有陳榮柏和唐宣慶歡宴。</p>
<p>不過遴選賽在熟列進行中，却來了很多不快的消息，最大的阻礙，便是出國的經費問題，與被選的球員，是否願意隨軍出發，綜合了各方面的意見，世運足球隊的出發，還是會有變化的。</p>
<p>這次爪哇隊來港表演，體協分會排定了三塲比賽秩序，第一戰對香港華聯，九日（週二）舉行，第二戰對九龍華聯，十一日（週四）比賽，第三戰對港西聯十六日（週二）對抗，塲地全在南華嘉山塲，票價分五元，三元半，二元四，爪哇隊在港作賽完畢，將飛往曼谷作遊歷式的比賽，時間許可，當往上海一行。</p>
<p>球迷滿座</p>
<p>九日是第一戰，港華聯列陣迎敵，也許這是一個新的刺激，比賽五時開始，但球迷在三時過後便源源而來，擠滿了南華塲，收入統計達一萬四千餘元，成紐不錯。對壘結果，港聯交以技勝一籌，前半時勝三球，後半時再加一隻，四球凈勝爪哇，比賽時兩隊的陣勢排成如下：</p>
<p>（港聯隊）</p>
<p>譚均幹　曾仲雲　侯榕生　譚煥章　張金海　劉松生　謝錦河　黎兆榮　郭英祺　馮景祥　何應芬</p>
<p>（爪哇隊）</p>
<p>王文慶　王良德　蔡瑞昌　吳昌和　張明坤　黄雙全　　郭鴻成　羅添秀　胡錦禮　陳　運　高進全</p>
<p>港聯先捷</p>
<p>港隊因有正選林汝順，宋靈聖，陳德輝，朱永强因傷未能出塲，臨時由曾仲雲，譚煥章，黎兆榮，謝錦河補缺。隊長馮景祥擇得順風有利形勢，爪哇隊開球，最先幾脚，頗爲得體，四分鐘過去，應芬得球急上，傳回山路，松生廿五碼外截得，乘空一球，文慶驟不及防，港聯先報　鑿。</p>
<p>連中三元</p>
<p>再戰又是應芬與景祥推進，應芬認門　吊，英祺閃入急頂，中柱彈出，十一分鐘，右邊兩將再度，互傳深入，禁區內應芬撥交景祥，「神腿」起處，成二對〇。繼續混戰，客軍猛烈反擊，迫得十二碼球，羅添秀宴客。卅二分鐘過去，錦河左路進兵，横向右送，景祥輕碰一下，致落兆榮脚下，「佛爺」順脚急抽，三對〇，港聯在前半時佔絕對優勢。</p>
<p>小休過後，爪哇踢得比前半時好，港聯只由劉松生射進一記罰球，爪哇則始終苦鬥，但終　擊破鴨蛋，港聯便以四比〇殺退爪哇隊。</p>
<p>評爪華隊</p>
<p>總觀全戰，港華聯合有超水準表演，前鋒的馮景祥和何應芬踢但最好，後防張金海最出色，爪哇隊呢！左翼郭鴻成不錯，一雙後衛也有表演機會，可惜中　綫太弱，前鋒脚頭雖有勁，但沒有射門的路數。最吃虧便是摸不着港聯的踢法，這便是爪哇隊遠不及港聯的地方，前　的進攻，沒有規律，爭取頭球沒有把握，却好用高球進軍，因此　方進軍機會，却苦苦不能射門，但以作戰精神來看，倒値得贊揚，雖然負了四球，還始終如一，最使人興奮的便在於此。</p>

<h3>一般物價　惡性循環愈演愈烈　希望迅速設法切斷</h3>
<p>曆年關過後物價的猛烈漲風甫至前週稍趨緩和，似乎物價波動又巳完成了一個週期，應當隨前週末銀根之轉俏而進人一段間歇時間，這一段間歇時期至少要在一星期左右，但事責之演變竟份外地出人意料。到上週銀根雖仍緊俏，但銀錢同業互拆頭襯已轉趨頻繁物價的波動又轉猛烈。這一點說明了前週末銀根之轉趨緊俏不過爲物價猛漲後支付籌碼相對短絀的一種現象，並非國家行局巨額差進所發生的效果，雖然前週的差進高達一萬一千九百九十八億元，但其中半數以上爲中央銀行所進，而國行所進，半數以上爲同業定存，其他各種收入，如煤糖，稅收等爲數亦不過二分之一。上週差進八千九百六十一億，爲數不可謂不巨，但其情形亦與前週相類。所以每週差進數額雖巨，並不能促使銀根緊歛，倒是物價一度猛升後，銀根可能隨之轉俏，但道依舊是物價猛升帶來的自然結果，爲主動的人爲的壓力所造成者居少，這也正是熱心憂國之士所最感覺爲前途隱憂的事，因爲物價始終是在一漲一平，及銀根乍鬆乍緊中完成了一個週期，然後經過一段短時間的休憇，又隨來第二個週期。其來勢是愈演愈烈，週期是愈縮愈短，這是一個惡性循環，是國民經濟的惡瘤。若是這一串循環無從切斷，這一個惡瘤無從割去，則其前途有爲熱心憂國之士所不忍明言者。然而據事實表現，過去遠者不談，這一串惡性循環，從抗戰勝利以來，祗是加速度地複演不息，我們在此謹再提出一點熱切的願望，希望賢明的金融當局勿再作任何枝節的設施，而要迅速切斷這一串超級通貨膨脹後期的惡性循環現象，假使這一串惡性循環無法切斷，任何枝節設施的收效恐怕不能如理想。因爲經濟形勢之嚴重已經到決定性的階段，所以不得不熱忱提出呼籲。致於切斷這一串惡性循環的辦法無法在此詳加討論　陰曆年關後兩週內據本會編製的按貨物用途分類批發物價指數上升百分之七十一，這是一次猛烈的漲風，但到前週形勢已經轉緩，前週末銀根轉緊，物價一致報跌，似乎上週應在銀根緊俏聲中繼續若干時日的平穩，但華北東北游資的大量湧來，尤其東北流通券的大量流入關內，使關內通貨在短期內又有急遽的增加。據天津金融管理局統計上月後半月東北流通券流入關內約達四千六百餘億。本市當然極受影響。所以上週雖在物價猛漲之後，銀根因物價猛漲而轉緊，但因大量游資不斷流入，本市頭寸依然未見短絀，各行莊互拆頻繁，結果物價漲風再起，其來勢之猛較以往三週有過之而無不及，各貨創新高價者不一而足。四十二支藍鳳週二一日內上升百分之十八，一週內最高達一億八千萬。龍頭細布同日上升百分之十三，一週內最高達三百七十三萬。上等白粳週四最高達三百八十八萬，門售達四百十萬。一二〇號A字天橋人造絲週三一日上升百分之十七，最高價達二億三千八百萬。廠縣更超三億。週末上午銀根再度轉緊，物價轉降，但下午國行大量差出，銀根又鬆，物價又形回升。結果是日國家行局差出三千〇十九億之多，開以往差出之新紀錄。由此可見，國家行局雖盡方抽緊銀根，但有爲事實所限制之處，雖盡力抽緊而効果並不常能達到理想程度，這一點殊値特別重視，尤其在最近一年來當局幾乎以抽緊銀根爲平抑物價的唯一手段。上週一般物價指數中以食糧，紡織品，建築材料上升較多。而週二外匯之掛升當然對於進出口貨有很大影響。但出口物品因外匯此次之掛高是否能從前週之困憊狀態中得一復蘇機會，亦頗成問題。事實恐並不如理想之簡單，因爲外匯之掛高同時影響出口貨國內價格，結果後者往往抵消掛高的影響而有餘。此次亦不脫此公例。總之，經濟機稱是一整體，彼此相聯，絕非醫某一部份便能治愈某一部份病症，賢明的金融當局諒已有鑒於此，不需我們再多辭費。</p>

<p>國內產銷貨總指數　三二五、四四〇　漲一〇、四</p>
<p>貨幣金融　銀根轉見緊俏　游資存底仍厚</p>
<p>本市銀根，自前週末以迄上週轉見俏歛，其間當局積極抽緊銀根，固然發生了一些作用，但這作用，非常有限。例如就國家行局的差進數字言，上週行局每天的實際差進，（以行局的差進總額扣除商業銀行於央行的定期存款，）有低如週四的六百億，及週五的三百五十億者，週末甚至一反常態，差出三千七百餘億。以上週的行局實際差進數字，與大前週（即二月的最後一週）行局每天有一千億以上的實際差進比，眞是瞠乎其後。但是上週的銀根表現出一般的緊歛，而大前週的確鬆弛逾恒，可見通貨膨脹發展到末期，通貨泛濫的局面非抽緊等等的人爲力量所能挽救。至於上週本市銀根，所以再見緊俏，不過是物價飛躍後所表現出的籌碼的相形見細而已。這種銀根緊俏的時間，不但將漸漸縮短，而且必然的會引出另一次更大的銀根　勢。</p>
<p>商品的迭現高價，與各帮競相購買的結果，使市面上單子缺乏，頭寸空前吃香，於是暗息亦漸漸上升。上週週初，暗息站定二角五分牛，但至週五那天，已經有高做至三角一二分者，至於證券帮套利，週四亦高至二角七分。一般說來，搜求頭寸者雖然十分殷切，但頭寸的供源却未見過度匱乏，同業拆放亦相當靈活，可見本市游資存底甚爲豐厚，一週來除特別敏感的金融性物品以外，一般商品之未因銀根之轉歛而見猛跌，當以此爲主因。</p>
<p>上週洋商銀行之差進數字，自週三起，即見增加，週三至週五之差進額，平均在穴百億以上，聞與資金的繼續南流有關。</p>
<p>商業行莊間接交換組之出數，週二週三雖降至一千多億，但週四週五又增見二三千億，至於行莊以現款解交央行提補單子者，每天平均在五六百億左右，銀根之俏，可見一般。</p>
<p>內外匯率</p>
<p>上週本市內匯各地之匯水，週二雖一度普見跌落但週三以後，又逐步上升，迭創高價，例如本市匯往廣州之匯水，週二每千元不過一百二十元，但至週五竟迭升至二百二十元，創穗匯之空前高價，再如匯往厦門之匯水週三週四不過一百二十元但週五突升至二百五十元，計增一倍以上，渝匯，漢口週二以後亦迭見增加，但其增加率不大，天津貼水之波動亦不算大，匯率彼動之緩急，可以表示本市資金南逃之劇烈。</p>
<p>上週外匯市基準率美匯週二又見掛高自十四萬九千元提至十九萬五千元，計增加三成，英鎊亦隨升至五十八萬五千元。上週香港申匯週一法幣十萬元尙可換港幣一元五角二分但週五已迭縮至一元一角七，一週以內即縮至二成以上，香港美鈔市價穩定在港幣五元六七角之間。</p>
<p>華洋股市</p>
<p>上週華洋股市，波動堪稱劇烈，市塲銀根的緊勢敵不住港匯報縮的影響，週五以前，各股普見挺昇週三一天，一則以港匯報縮，二則以美貸前途未可樂觀，利買消息風起雲湧，華股現期十四種　一致達漲限，週四游資繼續紛紛匯集股市，華股現遞十種再吿飛達漲限，週五受銀根緊縮美貸可望積極等謠諑的影響，市况忽見回跌，但自前週週末至上週週五華股如永紗之增漲率約近二　其他各股之走勢亦相近。至於外股因迭受港匯報　之影響，屢見新高峯，自前週週末至上週週五怡紗怡　約漲三成，英聯漲二成，會德豐約漲二成半，一般說來，漲勢較華股爲高。</p>
<h3>工商動態</h3>
<p>（一）生產　原料器材供應的不足，資金週轉的不靈，生產費用的逐日上漲，以及捐稅負担的沉重，對於目前的工業界都足以構成致命的威脅，這種威脅，有時由於輿論的呼籲，政府當局的某一種表示，或希望者本身的某一些幻想而表現出一些可能消除的姿態，但是曾幾乎時，種種傳說與願望又立被無情的事實打得粉碎了。</p>
<p>舉例來說吧：上週關於輸管會將開放自備外匯以購入生產器材一節，曾獲本市工業界的一致擁護並予以新希望，但據有關當局表示，以美鈔頭寸存入央行，過兩個月即可購入生產器材一節並不確實，於是問題又轉到如何利用國外存款輸入生產器材及其他補充器材上面了，這不但對於卜居外洋的中國貨幣資本家多提供了一條出路，而對於目前的資金外流也未始不是一種鼓勵。　本市工業界的諸種困難，不難於各工業團體的呼籲與建設中看出其梗概，就上週來說有七日全國工業協會的建議表示於前，更有八日本市工協理監事會的主張披露於後。前者的建議爲（一）請政府增加配煤以應需要。（二）日本賠償機器價格應予减低，申請日期應請放長。（三）所利得稅按去年六倍征收，不宜作硬性規定。（四）工商單位之救濟特捐應請豁免。（五）五六兩季限額原料分配應全數交工業界自行分配等數項，除建議以外，全國工協更推派代表晋京請願。但請願結果能否達到目的，恐頗成問題，例如就反對所利得稅按去年六倍預征一點而論，董顯光特爲此發表談話認爲六倍這標準不過還是應繳稅款的一部份，將來査帳結果，除營業確有虧損者外，都要補稅，如果確有虧損，則予退還，政府並付給利息，據他說所得稅今年所課乃上年所得，故實在六倍估繳，並非預征云云，這個談話對於赴京請願的代表們及在滬守候嘉音的多數會員們不啻澆一盆冷水，至於對一般僅免於關門的廠商言，恐怕，更多感慨了。</p>
<p>說到本市工協的主張，其內容可分爲兩點，一是針對政府的，即主張政府增加工人實物，配給種類及數量，並减低配價，以免指數上漲。二是對付工人的，即要求當局硬性規定工資之計算須按照發放月份前一月之指數爲標準。市工協此種主張，的確有其苦衷，但工人階級的收入，誰都知道，物價的漲速愈快則他們的貨幣收入愈與實際收入相差得遠，故欲以本月的實發薪金按照上月的生活指數計算，恐怕是非從手到口的大多數人民所能容忍，那末一切的要求也只能針對着政府當局了，但當局是否能不减少甚至增加員工的實物配給呢，恐怕又是一個不能終卷的難題。這個年頭，雖從事生產的企業家，亦已被夾在隙縫中而無法支持了！</p>
<p>於是許多聰明的祖綫，不得不轉到南方去，增加利潤的念頭使人們作建造另外一個樂園的打算，在這中原鼎沸風雨交加的時際，工廠南遷的呼聲呌囂熙上，但是，據報載某工業鉅子自華南視察歸來以後，感慨頗多，這位工業家認爲南方的原料更見缺乏，產品銷售亦甚困難，而且據這位鉅子分析工業須互助，少數工業南遷，無濟於事，結語為機器工業各工廠決不再作遷移的打算。</p>
<p>的確，在這多難的地方，多難的季節，一切的幻想，不免爲無情的客觀事實打得粉碎。</p>
<p>（二）外匯　基準率，上週週二，再加以調整，美匯自十四萬九千元掛高爲十九萬五千元，這與金鈔的黑價比，固然尙膛乎其後，但就基準率本身說，已經再增高了百分之三十，據說外匯的提高，不但可納黑市僑匯於正軌，而且還可刺激出口，但此次市價外匯調整以後，一般出口貨物，與以前歷次外匯的掛高相同，其價格普見升高，例如腸衣生產成本，每桶須價八千萬元奈以國外價格，日見低落，外匯雖再掛高，市價仍做二千五百萬元，不敷成本至鉅，又副光腸之市價達八千萬元，僅够維持生產成本。此外如鴨毛每司馬担在六百五十萬至八百萬元之間，湖州羊毛每担三百萬元，客家賣出甚少。再如十七號本地猪鬃之售價則由四千七百萬升至五千二百萬。按照此種情形看，外匯雖續予掛高，國內外價格仍未見平衡，顯然在目前的匯價與產本下從事出口，仍不免虧折。</p>
<p>外匯之是否能續予掛高，掛高後之市價是否能與黑價相近而保證黑價不再升，均有問題，所以輸管會輸出推廣處某負責人曾表示爲加强輸出起見，在調整匯率以外，尙同時採用收購辦法，據說外匯匯率在某一時期某種環境下不能促進出口物資川口時，政府即設法收購，而且據說出口商想自行川口，則政府決不强收，否則由政府收購再　出口商代爲經銷，據說這種　法目的在扶助出口商並推廣出口貿易，但事實上在外匯市價永遠跟不上黑價的今日，出口商爲避免出口結匯時蒙受損失，恐怕非以自己的出口事業逐漸讓給管制的當局不可，至於出口商自己則不得不成爲一個代爲經銷的技術員了。</p>
<p>再就此次擬議中的出口物資貸款辦法論，恐怕確受貸款的實惠者仍只限於政府所能控制的若千出口品因此進出口商業同業公會對改進出口物資貸款辦法，曾於上週表示其意見：主要者有（一）出口貸款，不應僅限於桐汕，生絲，茶葉，猪鬃，蛋品等少數物品而應編及一般商品（二）超限額之貸款，由出口商自己申報，再以指定期內可以輸出換得外匯之數字爲依據核，　數量（三）申請總期限延長爲六個月（四）押品可採銀行信用保證辦法，不然得以商品有價證券或其他不動產抵押（五）利率應按不超過月息三分的辦法辦理等數點。</p>
<p>問題的癥結所在顯然在官民兩方的利害衝突能否調和，對於外匯的收入，當局是惟恐得之過少，出口商方面自然也了解這點，所以雖然輸管會當局對上面所請在「原則上」表示贊同，但仍不得不爲了貸款開放問題，於上週晋京向財政部及四聯總處作「技術上」的商洽呢！</p>

<h3>上海火柴工業之處境</h3>
<p>上海現有火柴廠二十五家，共有排板車二百二十六部，每月生產約兩萬四千箱，每箱七千兩百小盒。其中以大中華火柴廠規模最大，擁有排板車及其產量，即達全部五分之一。除供應本市需要外，大部份運銷華北及內地，近來因受戰事影響，交通阻碍，銷路不佳。且製造火柴之主要原料，均須仰賴外國輸入。茲將其來源及需要量表列如下：</p>
<p>原料來源及需要量</p>
<p>名稱　來源　每箱需要量　如月產二萬箱需要量單位公斤</p>

<p>溯自進口限類實施分配以來，逐季分配减少，貨愈缺而價格愈高，搜購更形困難。僅就氯酸鉀一項而言，現在每月需量以生產量兩萬箱打算，即需十一萬公斤，每公斤現値美金四角五六分，總値約五萬美元，但目前每季外匯核配僅十五萬美元之數，事實上祗能購買此一項原料而已，而其他各種原料外匯，則無法處置矣。此外，如生活指數之增高，開支日繁，在在予廠方以嚴重威脅。故現今之火柴工業均已屆最艱苦之階段，由持至感不易云。</p>

<h3>太陽能量的來源</h3>
<p>— 周實民</p>
<p>太陽在每秒鐘內放射到外界的能量，等於五千兆原子彈所能產生的總和。關於這樣驚人的一個問題，經過科學家硏討了好幾個世紀，企岡瞭解那輸出能量的泉源。</p>
<p>第一次比較爲人所知的科學解釋，大約是在百餘年以前提出來的。解釋建設在這樣的一個觀念上面，以爲太陽的能量是由於引力的關係，就好像石塊向地球掉落的時候，需要能量一樣。因爲太陽質量的巨大，所以在它自已本身的吸引力作用下，逐漸的收縮，就逐漸地放出了大量的能</p>
<p>若果太陽所放射出來的能，眞是以引力作用爲泉源，那麼算學上的計算會吿訴我們，在比地球壽命更短的一個時期以內，能量就消耗殆盡了呢！至於其他的「能量產生」的一些力學上的解釋，也被提出來過，但是也沒有　一個能表達得很完善的。</p>
<p>到一九三〇年，英國的愛丁頓爵士（Sir．A．Eddington）以及其他天文物理學家的硏究，證明了太陽是一團熾熱的氣體，內心溫度在攝氏二千萬度左右。如此高溫下，不但分子被分裂成原子，就是電子也從原子里面剝離出米，這些原子核相互地隨時發生衝擊，如是引起了原子核變化。這就是太陽能量的來源了。</p>
<p>從一種原子變到另一種原子的原子核變化，也已經在實驗室試驗過了，放出的能量比普通化學反應竟高出一百萬倍。但是實驗室產生的原子核反應效率太低微，結果往往是產生的能還比不上輸入的總量。我們曉得只有在太陽那種高熱下才有可能的機會足以自動地維持它本身的原子核反應。</p>
<p>一九三八年德人貝特（Hans　Bethe）對已知的原子核反應，作了一次精密的考察，因而得到一個結論，認爲氫；碳和氮的連鎖原子核反應，很有理由被看作太陽能量產生的泉源。這種連鎖反應稱爲　循環（Cerbon　Cycle）。碳循環差不多可能肯定地視爲是太陽以及其他星辰能量的來源了。</p>
<p>什麼是碳循環？顯然的碳循環並不僅僅是一次原子核反應，而是一組反應按次地產生，以一個構爲質子的氫核和一個原子量爲十二稱爲碳—12的原子核爲起點。質子向碳—12原子核衝擎，突破了它所遭遇到的電的排斥力而被吸收成爲放射性的氮—13原子核，氮—13原子核自動地放射出一個負有陽電荷的正子（Po—sitron），再變成碳—13。</p>
<p>在太陽內部熾熱的氣流里，碳，乃原子核環繞運動短時刻以後又獲得一個質子變成穩定的氮，一四原子核，這氮核又將繼續運動，一直到再獲取了一個質子組成放射性的氧一五原子核以後爲止。然後另一個正子蛻變（Positron　Disintergration）出現生成原子量爲十五的氮同位素。再經過一些時候的運動，最後的反應發生了，但是此刻的原子核反應不再是簡單的收授，代替的是最後的原子核分裂爲二，其一是碳，一二原子核，另一種是普通的氦原子核，帶有原子量四。</p>
<p>綜結地看起來，經過六次反應只是四個質子和三個正子的變化，產生了穩定的氦原子核，但這種產生方法釋放了驚人數量的原子能。一磅氫以這種方法放出的能，比原子彈中一磅鈾發出的最高效率的能量還在十倍以上。事實上，這種能量的儲蓄確實非常大，我們的太陽如果以現在的一速率發出放射能，至少還可以維持五百萬萬年而不感到　燃料的缺乏。</p>
<p>碳循環中，碳的重新還原而毫無損失是値得注意的主要點，雖然碳是相當豐富的元素，但並不及氮的豐饒。所以，如果消耗的是碳，那麼在一定時期以內，或許是五千萬年，燃料的供給可能枯竭，而氮在這種情况下還能使太陽將來的生命維持五百萬萬年呢！</p>
<p>在實驗室里，碳循環中的一切原子核反應都已經被觀察而且測量過，自動再產生的碳循環作用（Swlf—regenerative　Cerbon　Cycle）所釋放的原子能確實符合於觀察中確定的太陽底放射能量。而且，沒有另外的原十核反應會如此接近於太陽在二千萬度高溫下所放射出來的能量數字，這可以作爲證實這個「學說的精確性」底有力根據。</p>
<p>存在於太陽里的原子核反應以及原子彈中產生的反應，兩者間的同異是値得指出來的。一兩者在原子核中都儲藏着大量的能，而且反應一經開始就以自己的力量促使繼續進行。但是相似點就限於此。以後在太陽里碳原子核重新產生，而鈾原子核在原子炸彈中却永遠消蝕了。碳循環包含的全是輕原子核，能量的釋放是在最輕的原子核—質子創造較　的氦原子核時，原子彈中却包含最重的原子核—鈾及鏷，而且能量的釋放，却在他們崩解成兩個幾乎相等部份之際。</p>
<p>最後，最重要的不同點是碳循環作用發生在負有電荷的質子及其他原子核之間，原子彈却是不負電荷的中子及其他原子核之間的反應。就是這一點，解釋了爲什麼在地球上只能藉原子核分裂，而不能靠像碳循環這樣的一組原子核反應，去產生實用數量的原子能。因爲不負電荷的中子方能在室溫中穿透鈾及鏷原子梭，而碳循環却須委極高的溫度，並且高溫下，質子更必須賦有高速度才能有效地克服碳和氮所具有的電排斥力以達到結合的目的。</p>
<p>關於這一點，在循環系統中質子須要高速，我們才能利用它開始碳的循環作用，是可以斷言的。主要差異就在這點，在太陽裏一切質子全賦有高速度，而實驗室裏僅能產生極小的一點，同時當質子穿過物質之際，它的　度銳减。太陽裏的原子核却始終保持一定速度，因此碳核及氮核間的反應能無限止進行並自行維持了。這也是循環的，由碳循環釋放的能量產生高溫，這種高溫的熱能也使碳循環得以繼續。</p>
<p>是否我們能在地球上產生與太陽中相等的高溫呢？這是一個新問題。最後我這樣回答你。</p>
<p>藉着原子彈，可以說這是可能的，但是縱使我們能產生這種高溫，我們却不能維持它，因爲熱將立刻以各鍵放射能的形式散逸掉了。而環繞着太陽中心的大量物質却可以阻止住效射能迅速的逃逸，在地球上有很多情况我們無法效摹，所以差不多可以說是一定的，我們將永遠無法維持一種像太陽出現的原子核反應了。</p>

<h3>趣味的物理學</h3>
<p>— 王乾德</p>
<p>一本好書的介紹</p>
<p>大凡在物理學敎科書上，對於現象或定律的敍述，都是一本正經的，用一套經過修飾的文字，而且相當嚴肅的把一種現象或定律解釋一下，然後就像傳統們的舉了一個例，這樣一個定律也就隨着告終了——道還是一種比較編得好的敎科書——，或者甚至有的敎科書上連例都難找到；於是讀完了整部的物理學，或背熟了所有的物理學的定律，公式，原理，結果還是一無所得，像這樣的情形是最可憐的，也是最可怕的。</p>
<p>趣味的物理學可以說是一本專門爲物理學舉例的册子；而且有些例是在任何的物理學書籍上難得遇到的，所以它是一本物理學的副課本，雖然它沒有把物理學的定律交代得淸淸楚楚，不過通過了一些簡單或新奇的例以後，那些物理學的定律就很明瞭的顯示在你的腦海中，一些兒也不糢糊。再說在這本書裏的文字都是非常輕鬆，使人看來一點兒也不感到麻煩與累重。</p>
<p>趣味的物理學一共分作十章，每一章所講的都是性質絕然不同的例，它的次序也是與普通的物理學差不多的排列着，第一章是「速度」，跟從而下南是「重力與壓力」，「力學的基本法則」，「環境的阻力」，最後一章講的是「磁電」車輪的哪一部分動得比較快些？</p>
<p>差不多每一個人都曾看到過了，車輪轉動的事實，不渦恐怕只有很少數的人注意到，或許甚至沒有這樣空開的人，整天的站在路旁凝視着來往的車輪，去注意一件新奇的事，就是「輪子的上部比下部動得快，你去看無論哪輛馬車（或自行車）在疾駛時的輪骨（或自行車的鋼絲），也可以看到上部的輪骨是混成一片的，而下部還可看出是分隔開的，依然發生車輪上部比下部動得快的情景」。在書裏經過了這樣的一段敍述以後，還有些小實驗及證明</p>
<p>不開玩笑的問題</p>
<p>當一輛急馳火車在你的眼前跑過，你會起一種頭暈或不舒服的感覺，但是你曾經注意到這急馳火車的輪子嗎？「在急馳中的列車，也有不是前進而是後退，的確，這種動作只是在秒的極微小的分限上，然而這種疾馳列車向後移動的事實，終究是存在的，不管道和我們日常的觀感是如何相反」——趣味的物理學這樣的說着，而且還有三張插岡用來去證明這件事實是確切的。</p>
<p>步行與奔跑</p>
<p>中國人往往對於自己所做的事都會感覺到「莫明其妙」，這種「莫明其妙」的感覺的產生是由於學術程度的低落所得的病，要去醫治這種流行病並不是一件容易的事；複雜與深奧的事，我們感覺到不知其所以然，那還情有可原，但「步行與奔跑」是最接近你的，你就不應該不明白它們的眞相，在趣味的物理學裏有二張圖，及一些文字，把這二個量普通的動作，加以詳細的敍述。</p>
<p>從車子裏出來要向前跳嗎？</p>
<p>生長在都市的人們一定看到過「跳車」的現象，當車子未停妥之前，一些老練的人就能消遙自在的上下，如同車子停止時的一般，老實說，跳上車只要你能緊握着車上的支持物，那就是萬無一失的，而且沒有什麼危險可以產生的，不過下車就會產生很大的危險，所以必須要老練者而且要向後跳「決不是向着車輛的進行的前方，因爲向後跳由慣性所給與我們身體的速度，可以消滅，於是我們身體著地，就不致有强力傾倒的危險」。</p>
<p>物體在那裏會較重</p>
<p>物體的重　是由地心吸力所產生的；但是「物體在那裏會較重？」這個問題好像有些新奇，的確，這是一般普通人所未曾想像到的問題，但趣味的物理學吿訴我們說：「物體在地面附近是較重，當物體愈深入地內，它的重量也愈减輕，若直達地心，重量就會完全消失，而且當物體離地稍高，它的朮量也會减少。</p>
<p>永動輪</p>
<p>這雖然有些近乎幻想，不過也是一篇値得一讀的文字。</p>
<p>其他還有像「槍聲從那裏來？」「電閃値多少錢？」「阿基米特能舉起地球嗎？」「日裏快還是夜裏快？」「不停留的火車」等都是極好的文章。</p>
<p>總之對於憎惡物理學的朋友們，看了趣味的物理學後，自然而然的會感覺到有趣味，愛好物理學的朋友們，看了它就得到了更多的寳貴知識。（趣味的科學，蘇聯皮萊曼著，崔尙辛譯述，開明版）</p>

<h3>臺灣日月潭的高山族</h3>
<p>— H.K.周</p>
<p>台灣的日月潭不但有風景，有動力，而且還有人類學上的寳藏——高山族。</p>
<p>台凝的高山族一共有八種，其中有膚色黯黑，臉刺花紋，身穿貝珠衣的原始民族，以前日本人呌他們做「蕃人」現在呌做高山族。他們每一族間言語都不相通，也沒有文字。可是在日月潭邊的高山族却受漢化，表而上已經和管通鄉下老百姓差不多，不過他們的生活簡陋，所以到處還可以看出他們原始的痕跡。</p>
<p>在距今二百七十三前，他們才到日月潭，在潭的東邊住下，耕獵爲活，全族有四千多人，由一個酋長兩個班長統活整個部落，在從前是要訓練武裝的，當他們和其仙部落發生鬥爭的時候，就是全族出動，每一個人都是鬥士，他們的武器有長矛，短刀，弓箭等，酋長是全部落中最擁有聲望和武藝最高强者。</p>
<p>他們生活的資料有農作，捕魚和狩獵三個來源，他們吃飯，是把食物裝在碗裏用手抓來吃的，在耕作的時期男女都是日出而作，日入而息，男的管田地，女的管家務，編織及造紙等，他們的房子非常簡陋，是全部用太柴做的，有的也做一點泥牆，他們水上的交通二具還是用原始的獨木舟，當他們農事空閒的時候，就去狩獵和捕魚。</p>
<p>他們也有上帝，是他們自己的神，每家都要祭祀。</p>
<p>他們沒有日曆，是完全依天象推測的，所以過年的時節不是我們農曆的年底，而是我們的八月中秋。渦年是他們一年中最重要的節期，也是他們最快樂的時候，渦年要過半個月，從八月中秋到八月底，在這半個月裏面，仙們一天到晚只是喝酒，唱歌，跳舞，別的事情一慨不管。他們自己也會做酒，而且非常愛吃酒，喝的時候都是用大的碗，酒量布好，請客人喝也是用斗碗，而且客人一定要一飲而盡，不喝完是不禮貌的，所以在他們過年的時候，酒量小的遊客是不敢去的，他們最要好的朋友是兩個人同喝完一碗酒。他們也很愛抽烟，而且姻癮很重，烟斗是用竹管做成的。</p>
<p>再講到高山族的唱歌和跳舞，是很能使我們發生興趣：在唱歌的時候，男男女女都集中在一個廣塲上，女的每人拿一根兩頭粗中間細的木棍，呌做「杵」，長的七八尺，短的四五尺，小孩子拿短的，大家團團圍住一塊扁平石頭，將木棍在石頭上不斷的敲，這樣可以發出一種粗細不同的咚咚的聲音，不拿木棍的女人蹲在旁邊，每人都拿一根竹筒，放在地上只顧敲，又可以發出另一較粗的咚咚聲，像這樣團體的敲打，很有節拍，聽上去也好像很複雜，敲過一陣之後，就開始唱歌，每人的聲音高低不同，但是很調和，據我聽來至少是女聲二部合唱，唱完之後，大家都，下木根，手牽着手絞形的圈成一圈放就開始跳舞，她們的手沒有什麼動作，只有脚的跳躍，大概可分爲四種步伐，有時打着圈跳，有時把圈縮小，有時放大，動作整齊自然，後來就連跳連唱，唱過一陣之後就休息了，算是完了一節。</p>
<p>他們服飾的樣子和顏色都是很鮮艷奪目的，而且有時節和階級的區別；衣服的質料已經是棉織品，（現在大部分都是從外邊買來的。）男子的外衣還有的用獸皮做的，頭上也包一塊皮當作帽子，男女全部亦脚，還沒有發明鞋子，（現在有的鞋子是外面傳進去的，）我們從他們的裝飾和衣服，還可以看出有很多原始的素質，不過現在已經不是他們原來的樣子了　，差不多都穿上了漢服。</p>
<p>現在最使遊客感到興趣的，是高山族的一對公主，尤其是二公主，又漂亮，又活潑，才二十來歲，她除了會講他們　士語之外，還會講日語和不大流利的國語，每一個遊客到那裏都可以和她做一次榮　駙馬，給她一百塊錢（台幣），她就可以和你同拍一張照留作紀念，現在這兩位公主，已經完全不像高山族了，有客來的時候，她們就打扮起來和客人拍照，拍好了照，她們就脫下番服，穿上漢服，而且還燙了頭髮，穿着高跟皮鞋，看上去眞是一位摩登的小姐呢？她每天就拍照的收入，平均就有兩三千台幣，所以顯而易見的，她已經由統治階級一變而爲資產階級了！</p>
<p>高山族的生活畢竟比老百姓更苦些，日常吃的是粔菜和糙米飯，甚至於吃稀飯，到過年的時候才吃一點米粉乾，其生活的艱苦可見一般，主要的原因當然是由於生產力量之低落和文化的落伍，從前他們是四千多人的一個大部落，後來因爲生活艱苦，都紛紛的外遷了，到現在只剩下二百多人，全台灣的高山族一共有十四萬多人，躲在山裏的仍過他們原始的生活，和外間有接觸的漸趨同化，能說台語，着漢服，務農爲業，生活較裕，在他們區域之內，也已廣設學校，敎育他們，他們都是國家的新國民。希望國內多派民族學家到他們那裏去考察，以便改善他們的生活。</p>
<h3>三一七的前夕　我們應有的警惕</h3>
<p>— 丁濟萬</p>
<p>後天是値得我們警惕的國醫節，回溯旣往，國醫界爲爭取地位，奔走請願，熱烈情况，宛在眼前，可是頻年以來，外患內憂的相繼，整個社會，陷於畸形的狀態，國醫國藥，也難逃此例，憂難困苦，不容我們樂觀。</p>
<p>年年逢到三一七，雖然免不了紀念一番，但央不能忽略了紀念的眞正意義，每年我們紀念的時候，自省是否有長足的進步，偉大的成就，値此國醫前途，面臨着荆棘重重，我們不要自餒，只要肯努力，剷除當前困難，唯一的目標，應該怎樣使東方特有的醫藥精粹，推展出去，開發其光明的前途，此則濟萬所厚望的。　三，一五</p>
<h3>經淋與血崩</h3>
<p>— 沈仲理</p>
<p>刮子宮引起之誘因</p>
<p>經淋者，是謂經血來而不止，淋漓不淨，其來點滴。血崩者，是謂經血陡然其來，如潮水之倒閘，但亦因勞動內傷，驟然充血者，更有起初經淋，繼致血崩者，數見不鮮，西醫病理，率謂子宮充血，當其初病時，每由於子宮粘膜發炎，西醫爲預防其蔓延起見，有行刮子宮術者，據病家自述，倘經多次刮術之後，每致發生血來淋漓，或血淋淨止之後，經過一時期，突然血來如崩，無可抑制，其時雖用止血之劑，亦不見效，則與刮子宮後，所引起之子宮內膜脆弱，易致出血之誘因，不無關係，若爲一種慢性子宮內膜炎，祗須行消炎性陰道洗滌者，如施以刮術，則有害無益，猶中藥應予補氣固攝之劑，而反投以化瘀生新之法，虛虛實實，辨症不無隔閡，則治療焉能奏效，茲將其症治之不同，略述於后，俾讀者知所問津。</p>
<p>『經淋』此症有經前經後而來，每相差旬日復來點滴，色黯帶有小血塊，或血色淡紅，兼有白帶同來，有因月經方來，憂怒感觸，引動肝氣，症見腹脹頭痛，大便乾燥燥者，皆屬衝脈不調（卵巢炎），但用藥虛實不同，實症宜活血理氣，佐以淸營，虛症宜補血固攝，並須注意靜養爲要。</p>
<p>『血崩』血崩之病原，並不完全由於體虛血脫之故，虛實各別，虛症多屬衝任不能攝血，症見畏冷面白，心悸腰痛，治宜益氣固血法，兼有肝陽上升者，症見面白唇紅，顴赤舌綘，則宜參入養陰淸血之品，實症每有宿瘀內阻，新血不能歸經，治宜止血化瘀法，對症用藥，無不應騐也。</p>
<h3>痰癧與癰腫</h3>
<p>— 朱仁康</p>
<p>有何分別·如何治療</p>
<p>痰癧與癰腫，同屬外症，但其起時有快慢，症象亦各別，輕重當然懸殊，因之治療亦有難易，有加以辨別的必要。</p>
<p>先講「癰腫」，起時很快，發紅腫脹，灼熱疼痛，治療得早，外敷骨貼，內服淸火消腫之劑，每能消退，較重者在一星期左右，皮膚緊張，釀膿成熟，應即開刀出膿，膿出後即見腫塊消，疼痛止，寒熱退，短期內收口治愈，</p>
<p>此種癰腫，較爲多見，例如頸項中的「頸癰」，手臂上的「臂癰」，腿上的「腿癰」，都是容易治好的。再講到「痰癧」，其情形就大不相同，起時極慢，在局部皮膚發極小的硬核，旣不發紅，亦不覺痛，就因爲來勢不凶，所以多放任不加醫治，日子長久了，逐漸加大，穿破後流出的並非是膿，只是稀薄的黄水，夾着屬塊物，瘡口凹陷，治療不當，經久不能收口，例如頸項中的「瘰癧」，週身都可發生的「流痰」（普通人叫流注），都屬此種　性的外科結核症，患者虛弱居多，須求有經騐的醫師，耐心治療，並注意補給其營養，才能治愈，</p>
<p>還有較輕的痰核症，例如類項中發生的「風痰」「猢猻痰」初起與瘰癧症相像，但起即疼痛，不散即易化膿，也是容易治愈的。</p>

<h3>中風與高血壓</h3>
<p>— 徐益謙</p>
<p>値此春天發陳之際，中風患者，顯見增多，蓋以春日肝旺，腎元虧者，虛陽上擾巓頂，腦神失主，即西醫所謂之高血壓也。按其病理，實屬血管硬化所致，此症突然發作，年逾五旬者，體元日衰，往往引爲戒心。</p>
<p>歐西各國，患中風者，亦不亞乎華人，常採用碘劑，鈣劑，冰帽，放血等療法，中‘藥則多用海藻，昆布，胆星，菖蒲，軍則川羚羊，犀角，頗著效騐，欲求預防之法，應於平日注意調護，普通多服再造丸，著者曾應用回天再造丸，奏效更確，其中主藥，含有犀角，功能强心止血，且更適用已中風者急救治療之用也（此丸提籃橋宏濟堂有售）</p>

<h3>樂在其中</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>悲觀主義和事樂主義雖然是兩極端的人生觀，但兩者都不能說是健全的人生觀念。這裏且談享樂主義。</p>
<p>享樂主義的目的當不出追求快樂與幸福，所以有時自稱是樂天派。像抱着合日有酒今日醉之類能度的人，他們也自以爲是樂天派。不過眞正的樂天派與享樂主義者是不同的。眞正的樂天派必須有逆來順受與隨遇而安的度址，他們並不想一味追求幸福和快樂。樂天派雖然不渴求進步，但其人生觀比較接近自然。</p>
<p>然而一味追求快樂與幸禍的享樂主義便不同了。這類人相信快樂是可以「尋」的，幸福是可以追求的。等而下之，甚至以爲「軋熟閙」和「找刺激」也是尋快樂的方法之一。例如到電影院去看戲，有許多人愈是買不到票子愈是千方百計的想先睹爲快，至於這本影片是否値得那樣起勁的一看，他是根本不屑一問的。飲酒必須爛醉如泥，賭博必須通宵達且，這才够得上刺激與快樂。</p>
<p>但眞正的樂天派是決不會如此的。一個樂天主義者的基本態度便是興到爲之和隨遇而安。看電影他決不想跟人軋熟閙，飲酒他決不和人一爭短長，就是最具刺激性的賭博，在他也有適可而止的限度。他旣不作杞人憂天之想，但也不至於糊塗到是非不明。他的所謂樂天，就祗是「樂在其中」四個字所槪括的自然哲學而已。</p>
<p>偶見最近某西文小品雜誌的補白攔中有這樣的幾句話：「幸福是不可追求的，祗能加以領會和啓發。」又說：「人在追求他所曲解的烏托邦中，每忽略了生活中許多質樸的美與幸福。我們在追求稍瞬即逝的物質的虹彩時，失掉了對精神上光華的領略機會。」這幾句才眞是說出了眞正樂天主義者所抱的人生態度。</p>
<p>快樂和幸福的意義，本來是精神的成份勝於物質的。一個飢寒交迫或歷受病痛磨折的人，固然談不到有甚麼幸福與快樂，但幸福與快樂不是單憑物質生活所可換得，却可斷言。窮人雖然普遍痛苦，而有錢人恐也未見得個個眞快樂。這並不是阿Q式的想法。普遍富裕的社會，自然大有助於人類的快樂與幸福生活。譬如說社會富裕了，大家穿得好，喫得好，滿眼盡是賞心悅目的事，這當然人人心廣體胖，减少了許多不幸福與不快樂的外在感應。可是人間即便有那樣樂園式的世界，但個人與個人之間，却未必盡能起相同的反應。</p>
<p>因爲幸福與快樂本無一定的界限，物質生活對此雖具有若干影響，但並不是決定性的影響。對此具有決定性的影響的是人的精神視界，也就是各個人對人生的態度。自然世界本無所謂快樂與不快樂，幸福與不幸福，你我根本無需去「追求」。快樂與幸福之感全視我與自然世界間所溝通的心靈程度而決定。勉强求得的快樂與幸福祗是刹那即逝的刺激而己。</p>
<p>爲結束本文，我再引用前文補白中轉引湯麥斯·愛迪生的幾句話：即「我們對於世上的任何事物，僅祗知其萬分之一而己。」因此我們應該向一切美的事物開啓我們的頭腦，讓我們的心靈儘量的汲飲生命，將我們本來僅接觸汚穢的手指去伸向太空中的星星。</p>
<p>但得補充一句，道一切絲毫不可含有矯揉造作的成份。因爲祗有在自然世界中能體會「樂在其中」的人，他才能獲得眞的快樂，眞的幸福。</p>
<h3>失業保險</h3>
<p>— 超然</p>
<p>目下保險公司風起雲湧，業務也五花八門，種類繁多。但是，保險業中最怪的一筆生意却恐怕是給英法兩國的保險公司做的。</p>
<p>時在一九二五年，暹羅國王普拉耶地卜克登基，他一看政治局勢不穩，便向英法保險公司大大的保了一筆「失業險」。果然，到一九三五年他被迫遜位，於是就靠了這一筆賠款安享餘年，一直到一九四一年去世爲止。據保險業人士稱，一國的元首　，保這種「遜位險」的，古往今來祗這位普拉耶地卜克一人而已。</p>
<h3>天下之大</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>美國第一任國務卿是湯麥斯，傑弗遜，任職時全國務院的職員一共祗有五個人，但其時國務院祗須負責與四個外國交涉；現在馬歇爾主持下的國務院中，職員總數達一萬八千五百人，但與美國有外交關係的國家也增至六十一國了。</p>
<p>第二次大戰後德境美駐軍中，百分之五十八以上均在二十歲以下。</p>
<h3>蘭前小語</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>從市裏歸來，妻和孩子都出去了，簾櫳寂然，却充滿了幾盆蘭花的幽幽的香氣。窗外，淡淡的陽光已漸漸斜西，那幾隻鴿子還是那麼悠閑地踱來踱去，頓覺在擾攘的人間偸來了頃刻的淸福。</p>
<p>忽然想起在西洋文學中，「蘭」這個字倒也是屢見不鮮的。譬如說，王爾德的劇本中每描寫到什麼香閨綉　，便往往有意無意的帶一句，「桌上是美麗的蘭花」；有時，更簡單地說：「繡房，蘭花，香水。」彷彿其他的想像就該由讀者自己負責了。在王爾德的幻夢中，蘭花增添了華貴，溫馨，象牙的殿堂中的淡淡的一縷清香。</p>
<p>我輕輕撫着那暗綠的夭矯的葉子，又想起了一位自稱「天下第一懶人」的畫家，他以鍾王之筆畫蘭，酣暢中處處謹愼，名雋秀雅，美是美極了。然而我的手現在所撫摩着的呢？較之那些精裝的屛條又如何？那些林林總總的葉片未必不美，但較之畫面上的章法完美自然又差得多了。我不禁把那隻盆換了一個位置。不行，總不能安置得恰如人意。</p>
<p>眞要安置得最恰當，大概總得動一動剪刀罷？然而何必！轉念一想，有人說鍾王書法終究落了下乘，不也就因爲在下筆前心中先存了一點「剪刀工夫」麼？不禁爲之一笑。</p>
<p>我也笑我自己。人家有了錢便買這樣買那樣的，一有工夫就打聽消息——沒有消息就聽些謠言也好，又匆匆忙忙去買這樣買那樣了。每一個人跳上車子就恨不得立刻到達做交易的市塲。整天談生意，吃飯談生意，晚上回了家接着電話，也還是談生意。明天從牀上跳起來趕市塲，又是生意，生意，生意。而我居然還徘徊在蘭花的前面，想起王爾德和鐘繇王羲之來了，豈不荒唐！</p>
<p>於是，欣然置酒，以巨觥自罰。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十二章　萍水姻緣（九八）</p>
<p>綺紈一面說着，一面就用手在床沿拍一拍道：「你請坐吧！」島雲却不坐下，衹蹲在床前，說道：「我說了請顧小姐不要見怪，我……我……我希望能和顧小姐澈底合作。」縱紈這；「合作當然要澈底的，那有幹了一半。又不幹了。」島雲道：「不是這麼說，我的意思是要終身合作，我這話說得未免冒昧，但是我確是有這種希望，因爲一宗事業，必須兩人志同道合，利害相關，才能幹得澈底。」綺紈道：「這個當然的。」島雲道：「我在影劇界，顧小姐在京劇界，我們不置氣，都有相當的經驗。我們合作起來，必定有相當的效果，這是可以斷言的。」綺紈道：「是的，我也是這般想。」島雲道：「我……我還有一個奢望，我自見顧小姐之後，我腦筋中就印上很深的印象，現在天緣凑合，會在醫院遇見，我們又談得來，我們心意非常投合，我想彼此結個同心伴侶，對我們事業前途，是大有希望的。」他說着話時，本蹲在床前，說到道一句，竟直挺挺跪在床前求婚。綺紈見他來得太驟，忙道：「你起來吧！給女護士們看見，豈不笑話！」爲雲道：「不！顧小姐！你答應我好了！」綺紈道：「你先起來，容我攷慮攷慮！」島雲站了起來。綺紈道：「請你先出去，容我細細想一想。」島雲見綺紈呌他出去，怕這事又弄僵了，說道：「我出去半個鐘頭，再進來行不行？」綺紈含笑點一點頭。島雲道：「道事關係我一生幸運，希望顧小姐不要給我一個失望！」綺紈仍含笑點點頭，目送島雲出去，躺在枕上，微微呻了一口氣，腦筋經這一番激刺，非常紛亂，定一定神，細細一想，自己和渚齋，在勢不能復合，以島雲外表看來，也不亞於渚齋，他的前途，比渚齋似還有發展，自已在北平旣不能立足，到南方去，精神上也要得個安慰，現放有這機會，似不應錯過。綺紈想到這裏，覺得祗有答應，沒有拒絕的道理。</p>
<h3>沉默</h3>
<p>— 漫如</p>
<p>有人說：「沉默就是黃金。」然而沉默的價値豈是黄金所能比擬的嗎？黄金的價値是不固定的，有限的。沉默却是永遠地無價的啊。</p>
<p>當你面對着一個偉大的建築，或一片壯麗的風眾的時候，你沉默了。因爲你覺得一切有聲的讚美都是多餘的，適足破壞以你的欣賞的。惟有在沉默之中，你才能細細地，充分地，而又回味無窮地領略到這個偉大或壯麗。</p>
<p>當你突然碰見一個好多年夢寐求之的朋友時，你說不出話來了——你沉默了。你不是有很多事要吿訴他嗎？很多話對他說嗎？突然碰見是多麼難得的機會啊。然而，你沉默了。因爲你覺得你這時的情感是不能用話表達出來的。一切所設的話與你所要表達的意思必定是相差很遠的。於是，你沉默了。對方會認爲你的沉默突兀不近人情嗎？不，決不會的。因爲他也說不出話來了，也在沉默了。無言勝似有言啊！</p>
<p>當你受到世俗的歧視，感到人情的冷淡而不快活的時候，你會到處找人和你講話嗎？會以發洩的方式消除你的不快嗎？不，這是沒有用的，有時且是危險的。你必須沉默。惟有在沉默裏，你才能仔細地思想一下，發覺自已的錯誤，原諒別人的壞處，從新鼓起對人世的信心，增加生活的樂趣。這才是正當的，健康的。惟有在沉默中你才能得到啊。</p>
<p>沉默可以增加人的生趣，陶冶人的性情。它的價値委實是無限的，而且也不是言語所能表達的。我也許已經說得太多了。惟有希望我的言語不要减低了你對沉默的價値的估計。讓我們在沉默裏仔細體味沉默的價値吧。</p>
<h3>海紅樓詩錄</h3>
<p>— 徐半夢</p>
<p>自笑</p>
<p>自笑流亡踏海來，塡胸莽蒼鬱雲雷，刀兵刦後餘生老，石火光中熱念灰。活計竟隨波上下，詩心偏與月徘徊，袤邪莫恨人情薄，天眼瞠瞠萬古開。</p>
<p>彌天霜雪臥荒城，赤手誰屠黄海鯨！蕭寺人歸芳草寂，蓬山月落大江橫。奇窮忽抱詩篇富，埀老猶誇眼界明，留滯異邦蕭瑟慣，相看百怪送浮生。</p>
<p>人海</p>
<p>人海在潮撲地流，殘陽無語下西樓，靑山埋盡英雄骨，白髮飄來隱士頭。啼鳥似爲花濺淚，吟詩常借酒澆愁。百年彈指盧生夢，一覺邯鄲萬念休！</p>
<p>吟罷</p>
<p>閒居高詠罷，白日去堂堂，故里猶烽火，空江已雪霜。聞鷄驚歲暮，掘鼠歎年荒，欲問今何世，悲來已斷腸。</p>
<h3>廣告術</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>康湼特州哈德門先生擁有農塲一所，他想把農塲資產一部份出售，特在紐約時報的分類廣吿中連登了三個星期日的廣告，但反響極少，使他非常失望。</p>
<p>哈德門決意用廣告商的觀點來研究他的廣吿，分析之下，發現出售農產品在心理方面去打動顧客注意這一點沒有做到，於是他決意重撰廣吿，而把其中的重心掉換了一下。</p>
<p>原來這農塲的鄰居是一個著名影星，我們姑稱之爲喬·勃朗克的別墅，哈德門早理解到農塲地段的名貴，他倒是想不出一個妥善的鼓吹方法，一面要借重大名星的名銜，一面不致被勃朗克先生進行訴訟。</p>
<p>後來居然給他想出了一種委宛的廣吿敍述，他在開頭先描寫農塲，接着他爲對於本農塲有興一趣的人指示一條辨明路徑的方法一如下：</p>
<p>「你從火車站下車之後，搭乘十六路公共汽車，到瓊斯路口下車。於是你可探詢喬·勃朗克的別墅所在地——本農塲就在該別墅的隔壁。」</p>
<p>廣吿一刋出就收到二十八起探詢電話，三天之中已經成交。</p>
<h3>友誼</h3>
<p>— 孺子</p>
<p>不要靠餽贈來獲得一個朋友，你須貢獻你眞摯的愛，學習怎樣用正當的方法來贏得一個人的心。—蘇格拉底</p>
<p>慢一點跌入友誼中，但當你跌入後，那你就該恒久不變。—蘇格拉底</p>
<p>友誼好像燐光，當四周都是黑暗時，它將顯得更爲光亮。—克侖威爾</p>
<p>愛與尊重是友誼的第一要義，若缺此二者，它就不能安全。—百特爾</p>
<h3>論禁舞</h3>
<p>— 周一志</p>
<p>俗話說：「怪事年年有，惟有今年多」，想不到纖弱的舞女，也會大打出手，　進衙門，把一個堂堂的社會局，打得落花流水，豈非一件怪現象？</p>
<p>不過，這是一個社會問題，關係着上海廿餘萬從業人員生活的生命綫，他們因爲生存恐慌，不知輕重，被迫而出此下策，實有其原因的。</p>
<p>現在，這個問題雖經這次市參議會提出討論，並通過決議案，但還沒有最後解決，將來的演變，仍有注意的價値。我想，政府所以要禁舞的原因，不外下列幾點：（一）政府中若干高級官員們，由於主觀的看法，討厭跳舞，所以使用行政上的職權，實行禁舞。（二）行政院節約運動委員會建議政府，在戡亂期間，禁絕全國營業性的舞廳，於是才有行政院的決議。（三）或許由於有一二位外國人的說法，指摘中國前方打仗，後方跳舞，政府便據此而採取禁舞的步驟。</p>
<p>我們對於第一點的看法，認爲政府絕對不應以少數官員們個人的好惡，主觀的來處理一件旣複雜又關係人民生活的事情。號稱法治的國家，實在不應如此。關於第二點，就節約來說，我們認爲國家到了這種民窮財盡的地步，應節維的事太多了，如國營機關，因爲有錢在手，便有隨意揮霍的現象，如果眞要節約，可以節省的事情太多，舉不勝舉。節約而以跳舞爲首，因之使多少萬人的生活發生嚴重問題，覺得近乎殘忍。就第三點說，一二位外國人所說的話，乃是一種象徵中國現狀的說法，並不一定指跳舞應該禁止，不能斷章取義的。而且，自從上海的禁舞問題大吵大鬧以後，外國人弄得莫名其妙，地們不知道爲什麼中國要禁舞。由此可以證明我們前面的推論是對的。</p>
<p>則仕先生在自由談「禁舞我見」的短文中，以節省汽油爲先，主張應從市長起停坐汽車一星期，煤炭應從各機關停生火爐或停燒水汀兩禮拜，這才是眞正節約，大有益於國家。因爲這些東西，都是越用越少，又不能用後仍在。人民袋裏的鈔票則不然，舞客用之，舞女與舞塲職工得之，其總數必不缺一元一角，儘管他們交易而退，各得其所，根本與國家無損。我們覺得這些話也是很中肯。</p>
<p>所有的無場，都是經過政府許可，發給營業執照的，而納稅一項，也和他業同樣辦理。所以舞塲的地位，同旅館，餐館，戲院，電影院等是一樣的，也就是說，舞塲的存在是合法的。再退一步來講，即以有害社會的事情而論，跳舞也不能列在第一位，像娟妓賭博等，試問與跳舞比較，其害孰大？根據現行刑法分則，如賭博，竊盜，鴉片，詐欺，恐嚇…等都有罪，絕對不曾把跳舞列入犯罪行爲以內。即令說政府眞有決心禁舞，最合法的步驟，也應該先請立法院通過一個禁舞的單行法，或把「跳舞有罪」列入刑法之內，那麼才有堅强的法律根據。可惜政府並不這樣做，輕輕的由行政院一道命令，便剝奪了多少萬人的生存權利，頗堪惋惜。</p>
<p>上海市舞廳業公會，前些時候，根據憲法，請求政府收回禁舞成命，我們深表同情。凡有現代智識的人士，的確應支持公道，替以跳舞爲業的人民留一條求生的道路。</p>
<p>在目前的經濟狀况之下，禁舞的結果，勢必逼良爲娼，舞女只有做妓女的一條出路。社會上憑空增加了這一大批的娼妓，是否是社會的進化呢？更就舞應本身以及舞業職工而言，我們沒有聽見政府對他們有什麽明確的轉業指示及辦法，如果只打官話，籠統地責成舞廳老闆負今後一切責任，恐怕這些老闆點金乏術，問題還是十分嚴重的。</p>
<p>最後，我們願意强調兩點：（一）政府的一舉一動，必須依法，如果動輙以命令代替法律，只有徒增紛亂。尤其在行憲之始，更不可自己首先不依法行事。（二）我們不可自甘落伍，專開倒車。</p>

        <h1>1948.03.15</h1>
<h3>Vice Chairman Sun Discusses U.S. Aid to China: Military and Economic Aspects Should Be Equally Emphasized; Constitution Needs Implementation Before Revision; Currency Reform Awaits Currency Stability</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Vice Chairman Sun Ke met with reporters on the morning of the 14th to discuss the National Assembly's tasks, the Vice Presidential election, and the international situation. Regarding this National Assembly, Sun pointed out that its primary task is to elect the President and Vice President. He heard that some people advocate amending the constitution during this session, but Sun believes this is inappropriate. The quality of the constitution cannot be determined subjectively; it must be implemented before revisions can be proposed. Regarding whether he himself will participate in the Vice Presidential election, Sun did not explicitly confirm or deny, but said, "I have neither actively campaigned for the Vice Presidency nor explicitly announced my withdrawal, because the party has not yet decided on this matter, and it is inconvenient for me to express any personal opinion. Recently, Mr. Li Zongren wrote to me, asking about my attitude, and I replied to him in this way. Foreign reporters have asked me, and I have replied in this way as well. Friends from various parts of the country and overseas Chinese have sent telegrams to inquire, and I have replied to them in the same way." Sun also said with a smile, "My personal views and actions have always been based on the interests of the country. I am willing to let the party and public opinion decide what the country needs me to do most." Sun further emphasized that there is no explicit provision in the constitution that the Vice President and the President of the Legislative Yuan cannot be held by one person. The Vice President has no administrative powers, which does not conflict with the role of the President of the Legislative Yuan. The U.S. Vice President also serves as the President of the Senate, and his office is located within the Senate. However, the proposed organizational law of our Presidential Office does not prepare an office for the Vice President.</p>
<p>Sun then discussed the issue of U.S. aid to China, believing that military and economic aid should go hand in hand. The military setbacks in the Northeast and other regions prove that there are many aspects of the military that need reform. Therefore, he believes that American advisors can be invited to assist China in training its troops to achieve reform. Aid in military supplies is especially necessary. The treatment of troops should be improved immediately, and officers should eliminate long-standing bad habits and share weal and woe with their soldiers. In terms of the economy, what we need most at present is to stabilize the currency value. This is the first priority. Therefore, U.S. aid should aim at this goal. Only after the currency value is stabilized can we talk about reforming the monetary system.</p>
<p>The Soviets Attempt to Communize the World; Difficult to Be Optimistic About Peace with Japan</p>
<p>When discussing the Northeast issue, Sun stated, regarding the petition from the Northeast delegation to strengthen diplomacy with the Soviet Union and urge the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty, that this is a matter of national strength. We concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty with great sacrifice, aiming to seek cooperation for internal stability, but have not yet obtained the Soviet Union's friendly cooperation. Given the current situation, it is difficult even for the government to urge the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Sun said, "I have been to the Soviet Union. In the past, the Soviet Union's expansion for its own security was limited, but now it not only defends its own security but also attempts to communize the world." Sun then discussed the Czech issue, saying that the Soviet strategy is to establish communist rule in countries it can militarily control; otherwise, it uses political means to form coalition governments, waiting for opportunities to achieve full control. Czechoslovakia was originally a democratic and free country, trying to be friendly with the Soviet Union for independence and autonomy. After this coup, the hopes of all those who adopt this policy have been shattered. The situation is like this in the West. How could it be different in the East? The issue of peace with Japan is of utmost concern to us at present. Judging from the Soviet Union's attitude, there is no room for optimism. Future changes in the international situation will also change our attitude towards Japan.</p>
<h3>Bayonet Fight in Luoyang; National Army Tenaciously Defends the Core; Reinforcements Rush Westward</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 14th] Luoyang Fang had a phone conversation with Zhengzhou on the evening of the 14th, stating that street fighting was still ongoing in the area. The National Army reinforcements advancing westward from Zhengzhou have arrived near Luoyang and are stepping up their suppression with combined air and ground support.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 14th] The National Army rushing to the aid of Luoyang crossed the southern area of Yanshi County this afternoon and is rushing towards Luoyang. It is expected that they will reach the outskirts of Luoyang tonight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th] Military news: Chen Yi's 3rd and 8th columns of bandits, along with Chen Yaping's 4th and 9th columns and Kong Congzhou's bandit forces, totaling 70,000 to 80,000 people, have been moving around Luoyang since the beginning of this month, attempting to seize Luoyang in three days and nights. Starting on the 8th, they launched a fierce attack on a certain youth army division defending Luoyang. Our army, under the command of Division Commander Qiu Xingxiang, first fought bravely in the outposts, inflicting heavy blows on the bandits multiple times, and then retreated to the urban area according to the planned. After noon on the 9th, the bandits swarmed towards the city, and under the cover of various cannons and mortars, they pounced on our East Gate. The defending army calmly responded, unleashing maximum firepower and annihilating all the bandits approaching the city gate. However, the bandits' ferocity has not diminished slightly, and they still rushed to attack, with shells falling on the urban area one after another. In the fierce battle until the night of the 11th, the bandits repeatedly broke into the East Gate, but were all annihilated by us. Until 2:00 AM on the 12th, the bandits concentrated their firepower again and bombarded the East Gate, eventually collapsing the city gate. Our officers and soldiers fought bloodily for five days and nights without closing their eyes. They were unable to block the breach in time, and the bandits broke in through the East Gate. The defending army immediately surrounded the bandits and repeatedly charged and killed, determined to win at all costs. The intensity of the street fighting was unprecedented. Although the bandits left corpses everywhere, their reinforcements kept pouring into the city, and our army, with its numerical inferiority and substantial depletion, the bandits turned to defend various independent strongholds and core positions within the city while waiting for reinforcements. After the fierce battles of the 12th and 13th day and night, although the bandits continued to bombard our various points with fierce artillery fire, they ultimately relied on our defending officers and soldiers, united in hatred of the enemy and determined to quell the chaos at the cost of their lives, to inflict heavy blows on the bandits at any time. The bandits never crossed the Lei Pool. As of the 14th, our morale was getting stronger and stronger, and we were still fighting the bandits in bayonet combat. Now, our various reinforcement corps are rushing to the aid of Luoyang. Division Commander Qiu has a telegram stating that he is determined to fight to the last man and not to be discouraged in order to repay the Party and the country.</p>
<h3>National Army in Northern Anhui Enters Guoyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th] The bandits east of Guoyang in Northern Anhui were severely attacked by the National Army, and the bandits were forced to flee southwest of the Wo River to Gao Gongmiao, Wangshiji, and Jianmingji. The National Army took advantage of the victory and entered Guoyang.</p>
<h3>Bandits Attacking Linfen Repelled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th] The defense of Linfen is being carried out bravely. On the night of the 12th, the communist bandits launched a fierce attack on the city walls from three directions in the northeast of the city. The bandits in the east advanced from Wangjiayuan towards the eastern district and pushed forward with protective excavation works; another group advanced towards the Yuhuangding area from the north, south, and Xiaosaka villages in the south. All were bravely repelled by the National Army. The communist bandits who attacked Yuhuangding charged fiercely five times, engaged in a fierce battle for three and a half hours, suffered heavy casualties, and fled in a panic.</p>
<h3>Pingbao Highway Completed; Traffic Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 14th] The Caohe Bridge on the Pingbao Highway was completed on the afternoon of the 13th during the general mobilization of the military and civilians to repair it. The damaged roads near Jingtangpu have also been paved and filled. The entire road was reopened to traffic starting on the 14th. In addition, joint train and bus services between Ping and Bao will begin on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced that the Pingbao line is peaceful and unobstructed for travelers. A section of the highway between Xushui and Caohe, which was damaged on the 11th, has been repaired. Communications between Gucheng and Xushui, which were also damaged, have been restored. More than 700 remnants of bandits who fled southwest to Lai Shui were attacked by the National Army and fled southwest again on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Use Youth to Infiltrate the Rear Areas of Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhang Xuezhong Hopes All Sectors Will Raise Their Vigilance</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 14th] Definite Intelligence: A large number of male students from "Nation Building Schools" and "Cadre Schools," numbering over 8,000, and female students, numbering over 3,000, have come with the bandits in this southward flight. Most of them are youths from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the bandits refer to them as students from the Tianmu Mountain area. Their mission is clearly to prepare to infiltrate the rear areas of Nanjing and Shanghai, gather intelligence, and confuse the people. Today, Commander Zhang of the 7th Pacification Zone, in an interview with our newspaper, specifically emphasized that the political significance of Chen Yi's arrival in Northern Jiangsu is far greater than the military significance. Militarily, the National Army is confident that it can strike the bandits in a short period of time, but politically, it earnestly hopes that all sectors in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will strengthen anti-espionage organizations and raise their vigilance.</p>
<h3>National Army in Eastern Dongtai, Northern Jiangsu, Pursues Remnant Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th] Yesterday, the National Army in Northern Jiangsu pursued the 11th Column of bandits in the eastern Dongtai area.

<h3>The Flames of War in Central Shandong Gradually Shift Westward; National Army Strengthens Defenses Around Jinan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 14th] In order to shorten the defense line, the National Army in Central Shandong has taken the initiative to withdraw to the area east of Longshan on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. The war has spread to the area east of Longshan Station, 33 kilometers outside Jinan, since the 13th. More than 1,000 bandits who attacked from Zhoucun and Puji suffered heavy casualties after being counterattacked by the National Army. The defenses of Jinan City have been strengthened, and the residents, who have the highest faith in General Wang Yuewu and are rich in military experience, are as stable as before.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 14th] The addition of National Army defenses has greatly reassured the people of Jinan. In order to ensure the safety of Greater Jinan, the authorities have taken necessary military measures, and officers and soldiers have become a fighting unit. The curfew hours have been brought forward to 8:00 PM every night to 6:00 AM the next morning. The defending army of Huantai withdrew automatically after repeatedly defeating stubborn bandits. The struggle for the Hongshan Dahuangdi mining area in Zichuan is extremely fierce. In addition to sending troops to provide reinforcements in different directions, the National Army has also strengthened the outer defenses of Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 14th] According to refugees who escaped from Zhoucun, there were many Japanese machine gunners and artillerymen among the communist bandits who attacked Central Shandong this time. After entering Zhoucun, they engaged in widespread rape, looting, and plunder. Now, refugees are flocking to the western section of the Jiaoji Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th] Yesterday, the National Army pursuit and suppression corps in Western Shandong compressed the remnants of Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, and 6th columns into the triangular area of Xicheng Dongping Lake in Western Shandong.

<h3>Catastrophe in Siping: Major Fire in the City; Defending Army Fights House to House, Inch by Inch; Bandits Break Through City Defenses with Human Wave Tactics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] According to aerial reconnaissance by the Air Force, there is a major fire in Siping. This transportation hub in Northern Liaoning has been ravaged twice, and the name Siping is now truly deserved! It is reported that the bandits attacking Siping are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 7th columns and the 2nd and 4th independent divisions of Northern Manchuria, the 5th independent division of Western Manchuria, totaling approximately 80,000. The defending army of 3,000 infantrymen fought bloodily to defend the city, fighting house to house and inch by inch. However, reinforcements could not arrive in time, and more than half were sacrificed. This isolated army of bloodshed lost contact during the breakout. [Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] The next action of the communist bandits after they captured Siping has not yet been determined. It is expected that they may launch a tentative attack on Changchun. It is widely believed that the period before the opening of the National Assembly is an important stage, and the bandits in the Northeast will use their severely damaged and exhausted troops to make a desperate gamble, threatening Shenyang in an attempt to confuse international public opinion. The National Army has made thorough preparations to counter the bandits' conspiracy. [Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] The bandits besieging Siping launched a full-scale fierce attack on the urban area with infantry and artillery throughout the night of the 13th, focusing on the northeast corner of the city, Yimiancheng, and Liujiatun. The fighting was extremely fierce. The bandits braved our intense artillery fire, using four tanks as cover, and charged repeatedly, but were repelled by the defending army one after another. In addition, the bandits continued to increase their forces at the slaughterhouse and South Gate in the southwest of Siping, and charged repeatedly. The defending army fought bravely to kill the enemy, engaging in extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat and fighting for every inch of ground. As of the morning of the 14th, the positions were still firmly held by the National Army. (Another dispatch) The bandit forces that infiltrated the urban area of Siping engaged in a fierce battle throughout the night of the 12th. Every stronghold was subjected to fierce fighting. Under our dense fire net, the bandits disregarded heavy sacrifices and used their so-called human wave tactics to attack recklessly. Our army fought bravely, and every inch of ground was won at a heavy price. Later, as the city defenses were completely broken through and many strongholds were destroyed by artillery fire, the two sides began close combat on the morning of the 13th, engaging in a heroic hand-to-hand battle, which has now turned into a mixed battle. It is reported that after being repelled from both sides of the Liao River and fleeing back to the Liaobei area, the communist bandits gathered their remnants, totaling more than seven columns, and began attacking Siping on the 3rd of this month. Our army, defending the isolated city, fought loyally and bravely outside the city defenses for eleven days and nights, repeatedly repelling the bandit forces. Later, as the bandits repeatedly reinforced their forces, and on the 12th, they continued to charge with tanks and deployed many anti-aircraft guns around the city to resist our air force, while dozens of their heavy artillery pieces bombarded our urban area. This granary of Northern Liaoning, the urban area of Siping, has suffered a communist bandit artillery barrage for the second time since last summer.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Leaves Guilin and Returns to Guangzhou; Declares Determination to Stabilize Currency Value, Ban Gold and Foreign Currency Transactions; Eliminate Communist Bandits and Fully Develop Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 14th] Song Ziwen returned to Guangzhou by special plane at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Before leaving, he inspected the military police at the airport. Song was very concerned about financial issues and issued a notice to the public before his departure, firmly stating that he would stabilize the currency value and strictly ban foreign currency and gold transactions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 13th] Song Ziwen gave his first speech to the people of Guangdong and Guangxi at the welcoming meeting in Guilin at 8:00 AM on the 13th (the speech was simultaneously telegraphed to Guangzhou and Hong Kong for publication), firmly stating that he would spare no sacrifice in the military and political aspects to eliminate the communist bandits in Guangdong and Guangxi. In terms of the economy, he would fully develop Guangdong and Guangxi. Guangdong and Guangxi are one family, and he hopes that Guangdong and Guangxi will work together. After the meeting, he convened a meeting of the heads of various departments of the provincial government to seek opinions on cooperation between Guangdong and Guangxi. The provincial government requested three points from Song: (1) Develop Guangxi's finance; (2) Combine the military forces of Guangdong and Guangxi to jointly suppress the bandit troubles on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi (Guangdong will provide firearms and ammunition); (3) Dredge the West River and extend the Xianggui Road to Sanshui, Guangdong, to connect with the Guangdong Sanshui Road. The cost of this plan is requested to be 180 billion, and Song has agreed to assist as much as possible. The specific plan is currently being drafted by the relevant parties and submitted for approval. Song hosted reporters at 4:00 PM to report on the current situation in the Southwest, stating that the bandit troubles in the Southwest are not worth worrying about. There are currently 7,000 to 8,000 communist bandits in Guangdong, and our team has increased from 15 regiments to 20 regiments. Regarding the bandit troubles on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, he has now consulted with the other side to jointly suppress them. It will not be difficult to eliminate the bandits in the Southwest within this year. In terms of the economy, he plans to develop the economy of the Southwest in a unified manner, with the first priority being the construction of Hainan Island. He plans to use scientific equipment to develop the island's minerals, sugar cane, and fisheries in the same way as the Japanese did. Guangxi is rich in mineral resources, and he plans to fully exploit them to revitalize Guangxi's industry. Regarding the Guangxi Province's request to restore the Wuzhou Customs Office to increase income, he is also considering it.</p>
<h3>America's Futile and Useless China Policy</h3>
<p>A Special Article Published by Ms. Annalee Jacoby, author of "The Last Stand of the American in China", in the "San Francisco Examiner" on the 7th of this Month</p>
<p>For months, Republican members of Congress have been advocating active aid to China. Senator Bridges, for example, has said: "If billions of dollars are spent in Europe to stop the spread of Communism, while at the same time our government sits idly by and lets China fall into the hands of the Communists, this would render aid to Europe meaningless."</p>
<p>Now, President Truman has finally recommended $570 million for China.</p>
<p>But this money, donated by American taxpayers, is not intended to stop the Communists, nor is it intended for construction purposes.</p>
<p>According to President Truman's message to Congress, this is for relief. He recommends that almost all of this money should be used to import food, cotton, oil, tobacco, and other commodities from China. A very small amount, $60 million, is allowed for construction, but no military aid is given to China at all.</p>
<p>We can't imagine a better example of "filling a rat hole" than this.</p>
<p>When the urgent need of the Chinese people is "security", what good is it to pour hundreds of millions of dollars of relief into China?</p>
<p>Relief measures may allow a few Chinese people to eke out a living for a few months, but the Chinese Communist forces continue to destroy railways, blow up factories and mines, and drive countless farmers and workers into the territory under the control of the National Government to become refugees, causing more and more people to lose their jobs, become impoverished, and be displaced. We don't know what good this approach can do.</p>
<p>We have to suspect that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, when forced to concede to Congress's demands for aid to China, are still determined not to help the Chinese National Government put down the Communist rebellion instigated and assisted by Moscow.</p>
<p>The proposed $570 million in aid to China looks almost like a bribe to Congress, to ensure the passage of the European Recovery Program, which seems to be of paramount importance to the government.</p>
<p>It is, of course, obvious that it is futile to help Europe recover without at the same time ensuring the defense against Soviet aggression. But, at least in the case of Greece, in addition to relief, arms and military guidance are also provided.</p>
<p>On February 16, two days before President Truman expressed his views on China, he requested more money for military aid to Greece. He said: "Greece is under increasing pressure from a Communist minority party, which is subservient to foreign forces and receives its support, and is trying to impose its will on the Greek people by force."</p>
<p>Every word of this statement applies equally to China.</p>
<p>President Truman also said that the Communists are "deliberately destroying Greek villages,肆無忌憚," determined to use "ruthless destruction" to "make people homeless, leave their villages and fields, and force them to crowd into cities, further increasing the already heavy burden of the country, deliberately creating miserable and difficult conditions, hoping to use this to incite political unrest." This statement also applies equally to China.</p>
<p>Then why is the government adopting opposite policies in Greece and China?</p>
<p>Why did General Marshall, when he took office as Secretary of State in 1947, give $400 million to the Greeks to stop the Communists, but not a similar amount to China to wait for the Communists to penetrate deeper?</p>
<p>Why, after we gained this experience in Europe, did General Marshall, on January 7, 1947, still classify the Chinese who "frankly declared that cooperation with the Chinese Communists in the government was inconceivable and that only a policy of force could solve the problem" as "reactionaries"?</p>
<p>Has General Marshall's experience in dealing with the Soviet Union as Secretary of State led him to know that the Chinese were right?</p>
<p>If so, then why doesn't he retract his statement?</p>
<p>It is now hard to believe that anyone, even the State Department's Far East Division, still thinks that the Chinese Communists are different from the Communists in Greece and other countries, and are not "real" Communists, but a group of harmless, liberal rural reformers!</p>
<p>This secret has been revealed by the Chinese Communists themselves, because they are daily scolding "American imperialism", restoring the old policy of "liquidating" landlords and all peasants who resist them (this policy was abandoned during the War of Resistance Against Japan), burning churches and announcing their 100% adherence to Moscow.</p>
<p>Now, is the State Department refusing to admit it just for "face"?</p>
<p>Are the Secretary of State and President Truman unwilling to admit how wrong and harmful the policy of sending General Marshall to China and forcing the Chinese government to share power with the Communists was?</p>
<h3>Certificate Design for President and Vice President Elections; Prepared by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee</h3>

<p>Agricultural Bank to Hold Business Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Regarding the division of loan business between the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury, a preliminary agreement has been reached after consultation between the two parties.

<h3>Watching the Cold War with a Cool Eye - The Opening of the Sixteen-Nation European Conference</h3>
<p>The political and diplomatic figures of the sixteen European nations have already gathered in Paris and are scheduled to hold a conference today to discuss the European Recovery Program. At the same time, the treaty of the Western European Union agreed upon at the Five-Nation Conference in Brussels will also be signed by the five foreign ministers. In today's increasingly clear polarization of Europe, the diplomatic dynamics of the Western European countries naturally deserve our special attention. In particular, the success or failure of this Sixteen-Nation Conference will not only determine the future fate of the sixteen participating countries, but also the European aid plan of Secretary of State Marshall will depend on the outcome of this conference.</p>
<p>As this article meets the readers, it is just a moment before the opening of the Sixteen-Nation Conference. How will this Sixteen-Nation Conference end? Of course, we cannot draw any conclusions lightly. However, looking around the environment of Europe, it is not only that the barriers are strict, and the iron curtain and velvet curtain have divided Europe into East and West, but also there have been a series of shocking developments recently, which have made people feel "shocked several times in one night." Even the American political and diplomatic figures standing on the other side of the Atlantic are frightened. For example, President Truman frankly stated that his confidence in world peace has begun to waver in response to the recent developments in Europe. Secretary of State Marshall also said that the world is now in a great crisis. Former Secretary of State Byrne shouted loudly, claiming that the world crisis is coming. From these short talks, we can really see the severity of the European crisis.</p>
<p>Since the successive surrender of Germany and Japan, the end of the war has only been two years and six months. After the war, the world was looking forward to the ideal of "all people are one family" and hoped that the great powers would create world peace after the war in the spirit of fighting side by side during the war. However, in the past two years, not only has the ideal failed to become a reality, and true peace has not been achieved, but also the "cold war" between the two major groups has intensified. As of today, even this silent and odorless "cold war" has the danger of evolving into a bloody "hot war." We do not want to blame one side for the creation of this situation, but if we just look back at the international politics of the past two years, it is not difficult to understand where the responsibility lies.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the United States and the Soviet Union represent two fundamentally different ideologies, coupled with conflicts of interest everywhere. Hoping that they will work together to create world peace is originally an unrealistic fantasy. However, the world has suffered from the cruel lessons of the war, and ultimately hopes that they can coexist and coexist in peace. Unfortunately, this minimum hope was completely shattered in the late spring of last year. From that time on, both sides openly engaged in a "cold war" and did their best. Standing in the position of a third party, we watched both sides use their "magic weapons", which became more and more amazing, and are now approaching the stage of "the dagger is revealed at the end of the scroll."</p>
<p>We do not deny that the United States took the offensive first in the early stages of this "cold war". For example, the advocacy of the Truman Doctrine and the announcement of the Marshall Plan can all be regarded as the prelude to the United States' anti-communism. However, because the United States is a democratic country, whether it is domestic or foreign policy measures, they must be discussed by Congress and supported by public opinion. Therefore, the United States is inevitably slow in action, and it is not surprising that its words and deeds are not thorough. Therefore, the United States is lagging behind in the cold war against the Soviet Union. We summarize the measures taken by the United States as follows: (1) Advocating the anti-communist Truman Doctrine; (2) Implementing the Marshall Plan; (3) Merging the three occupied areas of West Germany; (4) Forming the Western European Union. The above four steps all have profound significance in theory, but in practice it is difficult to exert their role. Especially the first two, have not yet been concretized.</p>
<p>On the contrary, look at the magic weapons used by the other side, not only are they quick to act, able to make decisive decisions, and do what they say; but also, in response to the magic weapons used by the other side, there is a situation of "the Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high". The performance of each action is shocking. Among them, the most noteworthy ones are the following: (1) Organizing the New Communist International, using anti-imperialism and anti-Americanism as slogans, to prevent the implementation of American aid; (2) Concluding military mutual assistance treaties with Romania and Hungary; (3) Encouraging the Czech coup and establishing a communist regime, so that the heart of Europe is also controlled by the Soviet Union; (4) Forcing Finland to conclude a military mutual assistance treaty with it. Finland, forced by the general trend, can only follow the Soviet Union's orders. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's iron curtain in Eastern Europe is not only deeply rooted, but also its power is becoming more and more consolidated and unbreakable. It makes everyone feel that the Soviet Union is taking the lead in the cold war and is becoming more and more aggressive.</p>
<p>Some say that the Soviet Union's actions in Eastern Europe will cause a serious backlash from the United States, and the United States will inevitably intensify its European aid plan and encourage Western European countries to form an alliance in order to resist it; but in the current situation, the conclusion of the Western European Union and the holding of this Sixteen-Nation Conference will not only be insufficient to resist the Soviet Union's actions in Eastern Europe, but will also be enough to promote the Soviet Union to take new actions against Sweden and Norway in Northern Europe and Greece and Turkey in Eastern Europe. In the past few days, rumors have spread throughout Europe, either saying that the Soviet Union will take action to threaten the four countries of Greece, Turkey, France, and Italy, or that the Soviet Union has asked Norway to conclude a mutual assistance treaty. Although it can be said that rumors are not credible at present, who can guarantee that these rumors will not become a reality?</p>
<p>We want to formally tell people all over the world that they should immediately raise their vigilance about the current world situation. We do not want to be alarmist, but the facts have proved that the seriousness of the situation cannot be ignored, especially do not forget that the current situation is more serious than after the Munich Conference in 1938. At that time, the aggressor, Nazi Germany, could only control Austria and part of Czechoslovakia, while Eastern European countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia all had mutual assistance treaties with Britain and France, not to mention that there was a "third party" force further east. But today, in addition to owning nine Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union also has part of Germany and Austria. Regardless of human and material resources and geographical location, the Soviet Union in today's Europe is as solid as a rock and cannot be helped. How can the five Western European countries' alliance prevent it from continuing to develop westward! When general historians discuss the causes of the outbreak of World War II, they all attribute it to the democratic countries' policy of appeasement towards the aggressors. This mistake has been remedied, but it has been paid for with countless blood. We must not repeat the mistakes in history in the future. We hope that the US authorities, which bear heavy responsibility for world peace, will take effective measures as soon as possible to save the world's tide before it falls! As the political and diplomatic figures of the sixteen European countries gather in Paris, the United States and the public should first conduct self-examination on the current diplomatic policy and quickly determine a plan to reverse the international trend.</p>

<h3>Supplementary Measures for Production Enterprise Loans Implemented</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] The Four Joint Offices have always attached importance to loans for export goods in order to assist exports and earn foreign exchange, and they are still included in the guidelines for production enterprise loans this year. The 360th meeting of the Board of Directors of the Office has now approved the "Outline for Fixed-Amount Foreign Exchange Settlement Loans for Export Goods" (already seen on page 7 of this newspaper on the 13th). In addition, it has been learned that the Office has continued to add four supplementary measures to the implementation of the guidelines for production enterprise loans for the 37th year, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Regarding order loans, purchase of finished products, and commissioned production, the following should be followed: (1) Order loans, purchase of finished products, and commissioned production will be jointly or separately organized by various banks and treasuries entrusted by the Central Bank on behalf of the government within their professional scope. (2) The scope of orders and purchases is temporarily limited to the items stipulated in the Provisional Measures for National Banks and Treasuries in the Shanghai area to purchase finished products from manufacturers on behalf of the government. Other local specialties that meet the conditions for orders or purchases should be reported to the Four Joint Offices for approval before being processed. The items for commissioned production are limited to those specifically designated by the government. (3) The funds required for handling the foregoing business will be fully advanced by the Central Bank. (4) Unless otherwise approved by the Four Joint Offices, interest will not be charged on any payments for handling the foregoing business. (5) The goods received for handling the foregoing business will be inspected and accepted by the Central Bank in conjunction with the handling banks and treasuries, and then handled by the government competent authority or entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau. The proceeds will be transferred to the Central Bank at any time to recover the advance payment account. (6) The Central Bank will give the handling banks and treasuries a handling fee of 2% to 3% of the value of the goods.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the short-term working capital loan part, the types, terms, and applicable scope are specified as follows: (1) The maximum term for short-term overdrafts is three months, which is only applicable to transportation and public utility enterprises. However, basic industrial and mining enterprises and export goods enterprises may also be given short-term overdrafts if specifically stipulated by the Four Joint Board of Directors. (2) The term of the export bill loan depends on the distance of transportation and is only applicable to the transportation and sales of daily necessities for people's livelihood and export goods enterprises. (3) The term of the packing loan is up to 60 feet, which is only applicable to Sichuan goods enterprises that can settle foreign exchange in accordance with government regulations.</p>
<p>C. Calculation of loan interest rates: (1) The following loans that fully cooperate with national policy are still handled in accordance with the low-interest principle, and the interest rate standard is approved by the Four Joint Board of Directors: Yan industry production loans and cooperative production loans. (2) Production enterprise loans whose production, sales, or pricing are strictly controlled by the government. (3) Other loans related to the implementation of national policies submitted by the Chairman and Vice Chairman for special discussion. (4) The loan interest rate of banks and treasuries shall not exceed the local Central Bank's listed market interest rate, and shall not be less than 75% of the above listed market interest rate.</p>
<p>D. The loan funds of banks and treasuries should first be used to pay for the deposits received, and the deposit interest rate should be calculated on a monthly basis and adjusted in accordance with the loan interest rate. The local Four Joint Branch Offices should discuss and standardize the handling.</p>
<h3>It is Incorrect to Say that Business Tax is Assessed Once a Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] According to the Ministry of Finance: According to the Business Tax Law, business tax is assessed once every three months. The Implementing Rules of the Business Tax Law stipulate that merchants should declare and assess business tax for the past three months within ten days after March, June, September, and December each year. This year, on February 14th, this was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to amend the Implementing Rules, stipulating that merchants should declare the business volume of the previous month within five days after each month, and pay taxes in the order of declared business volume, but the tax will still be verified and assessed fifteen days after March, June, September, and December each year. If the taxable amount is inconsistent with the amount already paid after verification, the tax will be supplemented. This amendment is still in compliance with the provision that business tax is assessed once every three months. The rumor that checking and assessing once every three months has been changed to "once a month" is somewhat different from the fact.</p>

<h3>International Children's Emergency Fund Decides to Expand Medical Program</h3>
<p>Including European and Non-European Countries</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake Dispatch on the 13th] The Executive Committee of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund has decided to expand the proposed medical program to include all European and non-European countries. This is the result of China's efforts. The committee originally only intended to implement a broad plan to prevent lung disease in Europe, but finally voted to implement this plan in Europe with 2 million yuan, and another 2 million yuan will be used to implement the same plan in non-European countries in the future. This decision was passed after the Chinese representative, Xiao Ju, strongly argued. The above-mentioned Executive Committee, when it concluded its current meeting last night, officially approved the allocation of 1 million yuan to China from the 3.5 million yuan fund allocated to China.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Prices Tend to Stabilize, Tianjin Grain Prices Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch on the 14th] Today is a continuous rainy day, and the fluctuations in various goods are extremely small.

The price of top-quality white rice is 2.5 million per stone, tea oil is 7.1 million yuan, green oil is 8.15 million yuan, and tallow is 8.5 million yuan, which is an increase of 1.1 million yuan per dan compared with yesterday, which makes the citizens speechless.</p>

<h3>Various Industries in Guangzhou are in a State of Semi-Stagnation</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 14th] The Guangdong Construction Department previously organized an industrial investigation team to investigate the industrial situation in Guangzhou. After more than a month of work, it has been completed and has obtained more than 4,000 kinds of relevant information. According to Jiang Hai, the head of the team, the team has investigated 22 kinds of industries, more than 4,000 factories and nearly 10,000 households of handicrafts, which are all in a state of semi-stagnation. Most of the larger factories have been unable to support themselves and have closed down one after another. Even those who are struggling to maintain are in a dangerous situation. Only handicrafts can barely survive for a while, but they are also dying. The reasons are: (1) Insufficient funds, (2) Lack of raw materials, (3) Severe financial fluctuations, (4) Sales channels cannot be developed, (5) Foreign goods are flooding the market. The authorities are now paying close attention to this serious problem and will ask the central government to thoroughly resolve it. Otherwise, the future of private industries in Guangzhou will be unimaginable.</p>

<h3>US Aid to European Recovery Program Passes Senate, Moves to House</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US Senate passed the European Recovery Program with an overwhelming majority on the 13th to support Western Europe and prevent communism and chaos. The largest peacetime foreign economic program in American history completed its first legislative procedure with a vote of 69 to 17 in a special Senate meeting late on the 13th. The bill has now been sent to the House of Representatives and is expected to pass in early April. The bill authorizes the government to provide 5.3 billion dollars worth of goods and money to sixteen Western European countries, and the total amount of money will be allocated at a later date. The Senate's passage of the bill came after warnings from Secretary of State Marshall and President Truman that the new pressure of communism in Europe has worsened the international situation. It is reported that the administration is considering a new military preparedness plan in the hope of curbing the progress of communism in Europe. The European Recovery Program has been opposed by the International Communist Information Bureau, which has announced its intention to obstruct it. The Senate's passage of the bill was a victory for Senate Chairman Vandenberg. With strong bipartisan support, Vandenberg led lawmakers in defeating the proposals of more than 30 Republican "revisionists" to reduce and rewrite the entire plan. Vandenberg said that some Western European countries are still outside the Iron Curtain and that the European aid plan is the US's fulfillment of its promise to continue to support their democratic institutions and promote economic recovery. The European aid bill passed late on the 13th is essentially the same as the original bill submitted by Truman to Congress. An independent administrator will preside over the plan, and Congress will set up a "supervisory committee" to review its progress. The US will also appoint an "ambassador-at-large" to liaise with the participating countries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The historically groundbreaking 5.3 billion dollar European aid bill was passed by the Senate yesterday. The bill stipulates that relief matters for the first year must be implemented starting from the first day of next month. The House of Representatives is also expected to pass it, but there is a tendency to reduce funding and discuss it in conjunction with the economic aid to China plan. After the two houses of Congress pass the bill, an actual appropriation bill will still need to be submitted. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has decided to handle foreign aid matters in one case. The content of the case is divided into two parts: economic aid and military aid. Economic aid is targeted at the sixteen countries of Western Europe and China, and military aid is targeted at China, Greece, and Turkey. How to adjust it with what the Senate has passed is quite troublesome.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The US Senate last night rejected, in a voice vote, a Marshall Plan amendment for a Western Allied military alliance against the Soviet Union. The amendment was proposed by Republican Senator Bower, who called for an "immediate" showdown with the Soviet Union, otherwise the European Recovery Program would only lead to "failure, bankruptcy, and war."</p>
<h3>White House Holds Secret Meeting to Plan New Military Strategy: Using Force as a Backing to Stop Soviet Aggression</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US administration is actively considering a new military preparedness plan to make the Soviet Union understand that further aggression will endanger itself. Officials said that the plan is being studied by President Truman and the cabinet. They feel that the US has the possibility of promulgating a tough foreign policy, which will state that future communist aggression will be regarded as a threat to international peace and Italian security. If the two-pronged motion currently under discussion is approved, it will be implemented to prevent a possible communist coup in Italy. The US will assure Western European countries that the US intends to support them militarily and economically under the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The US Joint Chiefs of Staff held a secret meeting with Secretary of Defense Forrestal at the Naval Air Station in Key West, Florida, 1,200 miles from Washington, D.C., over the weekend. The location is where President Truman is vacationing, hence the name "Little White House." The US military leaders discussed the tasks of the army, navy, and air force in future wars. It is generally believed that although this meeting is unrelated to recent developments in Europe, the tension in the international situation has prompted Congress to intensify its criticism of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's failure to formulate a joint combat plan for the three services. The results of the Key West meeting can eliminate the differences between military leaders on the tasks assigned to each combat unit in the strategic plan and produce a plan with full flexibility. It is reported that the most important difficulty is the conflict between the navy and the air force on the issue of long-range operations. The air force believes that long-range reconnaissance and bombing are the tasks of the air force, so the funds allocated to the navy for this purpose should be allocated to the air force. The navy believes that the air force's task is only to protect American skies, and that the airplanes of naval aircraft carriers should be responsible for attacks outside the country in the initial stages of any future war. Furthermore, opinions on national defense are not consistent in the political sphere. President Truman is once again asking Congress to approve a universal military training system so that the army and navy will have a large number of reservists, while Senator Taft argues that the US's defense should be built on an exceptionally powerful air force, and that the number of navies and infantry may be reduced.</p>
<h3>Outline of the European Recovery Program</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The outline of the European Recovery Program passed by the US Senate is as follows:</p>
<p>"Purpose": To rebuild the economic stability of the sixteen countries of Western Europe and West Germany, increase trade between Western Europe and the Americas, and eventually restore commercial relations between the industrial countries of Western Europe and the agricultural countries of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>"Method": The United States should provide goods and assistance to countries that are making unremitting efforts to recover. Within four years and three months, the United States will supply the main items urgently needed for economic construction. Since Europe is unable to repay in gold, the United States will immediately lend some and provide long-term loans.</p>
<p>"History": On June 5, 1947, US Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech at Harvard University, initially proposing this plan. One month later, representatives of sixteen European countries gathered in Paris to draft a balance sheet of recovery needs and guarantee cooperation.</p>
<p>"Administration": The Recovery Administration will be established by one independent official, who will hold a cabinet position and preside over the plan. One ambassador-at-large will maintain contact with participating countries. Congress will set up a "supervisory" committee to inspect the progress of the plan. "US Funding Period": The case recommends establishing a 51-month plan. If European countries cannot fulfill their promises, or if the situation in Europe changes, making it unnecessary to continue the plan, Congress or the President may cancel the plan. The total cost for the first year is 5.3 billion yuan, but the detailed funds must be allocated by Congress, because the estimated total of 51 is as high as 17 billion yuan.</p>
<p>"European Guarantee": Recipient countries should reveal the "national goals" of rebuilding the economy and production, guarantee efforts to balance currency, reduce trade barriers, and cooperate to maximize production.</p>
<h3>French Miners Strike on Eve of Sixteen-Nation Conference</h3>
<p>Reportedly Manipulated by the French Communist Party</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] As the Sixteen-Nation Marshall Plan Conference is scheduled to be held here on the 15th, the French Communist Party-controlled General Confederation of Labor threatened to strike or issued strike threats on the night of the 13th, striking a blow at the French economy. 30,000 miners in the northern French coal mining area, which is known as a "communist hotbed", have already gone on strike. Officials fear that the coal mine strike will extend to the metal industry, but the union representatives of 18,000 striking workers voted to end the strike and return to work on Monday. At the union meeting on the 13th, this group of representatives will advise them to resume work. Minister of Commerce and Industry Lacoste said that the strike was "purely political". Hotels in Paris are also threatening to stop work. The strike is taking place just as the delegates of the sixteen countries are gathering in large numbers to hold talks. The future of Western Europe may be greatly affected by these talks.</p>
<h3>French Official Denies Annexing Kiel City</h3>

<h3>Second Conference of Sixteen Western European Nations Opens in Paris Today</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary as Chairman to Deliver Important Speech</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] When the first conference of the sixteen Marshall Plan countries opens here on Monday, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, as chairman, will deliver a major policy statement. The countries of the continent are waiting with great concern for Bevin's speech, and they are very keen to know whether the future of the British economy will be closely linked to the continent. Diplomatic circles believe that the main issue on the agenda of this conference is the issue of making West Germany participate in the Western European economic plan. This proposal is the result of consultations between Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on the German issue in London and the five-nation conference in Beijing, and will be approved by this sixteen-nation conference.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the French delegation, after seeking the consent of the British delegation, will propose defining the permanent institutions of the sixteen countries that handle aid under the Marshall Plan. It is reported that the French proposal intends to make the permanent institutions formulate annual comprehensive economic plans for the sixteen countries based on the plans of each of the sixteen countries, with reference to the achievements of the sixteen countries in self-help in the past year and the US aid they will receive in the future. According to related sources, the Portuguese delegation will move at this conference to make Spain participate in the European Recovery Program.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Permanent Organization for Genuine Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The Western European Sixteen-Nation Conference will have as one of its most important tasks the appointment of inspectors under a permanent economic cooperation organization. The task of these inspectors is to investigate the use of aid materials by recipient countries, submit periodic reports to Washington, and ascertain that aid materials have appropriate sources and destinations. The first two or three days of the Paris Conference will be devoted to general discussions, after which participating experts will begin to study: (1) the organization of a permanent cooperation agency representing the sixteen nations; (2) the achievements of each participating country regarding short-term and long-term assistance since last July. British and French delegations have contacted the capitals of the other fourteen countries and have reached a preliminary agreement on the aforementioned two points, so it is expected that this conference will make smooth progress. However, some difficulties are expected regarding the appointment of inspectors, with some countries, such as Switzerland, opposing the right of foreign inspectors to enter their territory to exercise inspection and control powers. The idea of ​​US officials supervising the transportation and use of European aid materials has apparently been abandoned, and Western European politicians have expressed their approval of this US attitude. Regarding the report on the progress of the sixteen-nation self-help plan since last July, the secretariat of the European Economic Cooperation Committee established by the first conference last year has drafted a report, which is only awaiting review by this conference. Discussion of the consequences of the Anglo-French-Dutch-Belgian-Luxembourg fifty-year alliance treaty is not on the agenda of this conference. However, the establishment of the five-nation treaty will definitely make a significant and useful contribution to strengthening the unity of the sixteen nations.</p>
<h3>Austria's Anti-Communism Is Relentless and Determined Not to Follow in Czechoslovakia's Footsteps</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 13th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl delivered a powerful speech here today, emphasizing that Austria is determined not to follow in Czechoslovakia's footsteps. He said that the development of Czechoslovakia is a serious warning to Austria. However, the Communist Party in Austria is only a "dwarf" party, not involved in the government or other administrative institutions, and trade union organizations have been quite stable in the past week. One side has repeatedly accused the Austrian government of selling out Austria to the West by participating in the Marshall Plan. It must be understood that Austria's situation is like that of children after their parents' divorce, with one side beating them and the other willing to take them in. Of course, Austria can only turn to the side that is willing to take them in.</p>
<h3>The "Renoir Explorer" Plane Arrives in Los Angeles</h3>
<p>Returning to China for Work After Repairs</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Los Angeles, 13th, Associated Press] The "Renoir Explorer" plane, which was sent to the United States for repairs, arrived here today from Honolulu, piloted by Captain Odom. This world-renowned aviator said that although the "Explorer" experienced an engine oil leak en route, he had no difficulties during the long night flight. The only inconvenience was that we could not smoke for thirteen hours. The cause of the oil leak was that ground crew in the East mistakenly added 145-octane gasoline to the aircraft's fuel tank, while the aircraft usually uses 100-octane gasoline. Odom said that while the plane is being repaired, he will fly another plane to New York to visit his family. Then, he will fly the "Explorer" back to China to work for the scientific expedition led by Renoir.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Philosophy Has Been Thoroughly Reformed</h3>
<p>The Military Is Entirely Controlled by the Politburo</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] Lei, former Director of the Soviet Economic Division of the US Department of the Army, wrote in the current issue of "United Nations World" magazine: "Soviet military philosophy was thoroughly reformed a year ago. The new military theory regards the military as a tool of persuasion as part of an overall ideological war strategy. General Zhukov, the hero who defended Moscow and Leningrad, was dismissed for holding different ideas and offending the 'political generals' Voroshilov and Zhdanov. There is fierce infighting between the Communist Party and Red Army generals. The military advocates the separation of the military from the Party, and that the military structure should be established along traditional military lines, focusing on land warfare and concentrating on the defense of the Soviet homeland. The leader of this theory, Zhukov, has the support of a small number of professional soldiers, including Air Force General Novikov. The opposition believes that the military is a revolutionary political tool. This faction is headed by the current Minister of Military Affairs, Bulganin, and supported by Generals Rokossovsky and Konev. The dispute between the two factions was resolved by Stalin, who replaced Zhukov and other senior generals. The mission of the Soviet army was completely revised according to the path indicated by Stalin. Stalin said that the Red Army has three major characteristics: first, it is a tool for liberating peasants and workers from the shackles of landlords and capitalists; second, it is a common army of the people of the Soviet Union; and third, it has an international character, it is an army of world revolution, an army of workers in all countries. The practical strategic result of this doctrine is the alternating use of politics and war. This war is not directed by any military organization, but by the Politburo of the highest political organ. The Soviet Union does not hope for an actual war at any time now or in the future, because the outbreak of actual war proves the complete failure of the Soviet Union's political war."</p>
<h3>Britain Implements Summer Time</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] Britain has decided to implement summer time from the 14th, setting the clocks forward one hour at 2:00 am standard time (10:00 am Shanghai time) until the end of October.</p>
<h3>US Government Decides to Abandon Dismantling Japanese Zaibatsu Economy, Believing Past Plans Were Too Drastic</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Well-informed sources told the Associated Press that the State Department and the military have decided to abandon the plan to dismantle Japan's economic monopoly. These sources emphasized that this does not mean that the United States has abandoned the dismantling of Japan's "excessive economic concentration" such as the Zaibatsu groups, but that the United States believes that the original plan was too drastic.</p>
<h3>Five Hundred Yugoslavs Join Arab Army to Fight</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] During the discussion of the Palestine issue by the United States, the Soviet Union, France and China, it was learned that 500 Yugoslav Muslims had departed from the south for Palestine to join the Arab forces. According to Rome Radio, 77 Albanians, 20 Yugoslavs, and 21 Croats have arrived in Beirut via Italy to join the Arab army.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Instills Communist Ideas in Japanese Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] According to Nishimura Tadashi, a former Mainichi Shimbun reporter who resided in a Siberian prisoner-of-war camp for more than two years, more than one million Japanese prisoners of war were transported to the Soviet Union after Japan's surrender, and most of them were engaged in labor and technical work. Nishimura recently wrote an article in New Star magazine, analyzing the political education of Japanese prisoners of war, stating that the Soviet Union believes that these more than one million young Japanese people are a major contribution to its Fourth Five-Year Plan. Nishimura explained in detail the Soviet Union's education work for Japanese prisoners of war, saying that all ideological education is based on the motivation of increasing production. In 1946, it also launched the "Elite Force" and "Youth Action" movements to promote labor efficiency. In addition, it launched the "Democratization Movement" to increase the prisoners of war's willingness to work. The Soviet authorities' movement to win over communist believers mainly targeted young people in their twenties. Older people are more likely to accept the disguise of communism and strip it off after returning to their home countries. Young people find it difficult to accept communism, but it is also not easy to forget. Some young people have deeply believed in communism.</p>

The Dutch side did not express any opinions on this meeting.</p>

<h3>The Spring Crisis Is Imminent, the US and the Soviet Union Have Approached a "Showdown," and the US Attention Will Focus on the Situation in Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The expansion of Soviet communism and the unity of Western countries may result in a showdown this spring, which is a matter of deep concern for the United States and other countries overseas. The United States has been committed to curbing the spread of aggressive communism since the promulgation of the Truman Doctrine, and is now in the most urgent international crisis since World War II. A final showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union is almost inevitable in the near future. On March 12th of last year, President Truman announced to Congress that US policy must support free nations that resist armed minorities or external pressure to conquer them, and requested assistance to Greece and Turkey. This implicitly demanded that the Soviet Union stop in the Middle East. The Congress then passed a bill to aid Turkey with 400 million US dollars to resist the direct pressure from the Soviet Union, and to support Greece against the internal aggression of the Communist Party. However, the effect of this doctrine has a greater impact on other countries. The direct result was the conflict at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow to discuss the treaty with Germany. France suddenly changed its course, gradually leaning towards Western countries, and expressing that it was no longer afraid of the Soviet Union. The entire Europe reacted, and the United States finally decided not to make empty speeches about political freedom against Soviet threats, but to be realistic. US officials hoped that the declaration of the Truman Doctrine, coupled with hundreds of millions of US dollars, would stop the Soviet Union, but its policy of assisting Greece and Turkey was not successful. Today, Marshall has asked Congress to allocate an additional 275 million US dollars to extend military assistance to Greece and Turkey for one year, and there may be other requests in the future. Last June, the economic collapse of Western European countries alarmed the US government. Marshall promised to provide assistance to European countries that cooperate and help themselves, which gave rise to the so-called Marshall Plan, as an economic barrier to prevent communism from spreading in chaos. Now, the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have established an agreement and will inevitably ask the United States to provide military guarantees. The Communist Party's conquest of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union's demands on Finland have clearly come to an end. The entire phenomenon of the Soviet Union's post-war policy, whether direct or indirect, has actually been completed. The question is whether US officials are bothered, and what will happen next? The Soviet Union's current actions will inevitably involve the countries to which the Truman Doctrine applies. The general public is deeply afraid that the expansion of Soviet communism will have a showdown with Western countries this spring, and this is the reason. The focus of attention in the entire United States is now on Italy. April 18th is the date of its general election, and the United States will do its best to reduce the number of votes won by the Communist Party, so that it cannot rise to power. Whether the methods used by the US government will be successful and whether the Communist Party will resort to force are all questions. The imminent crisis of spring is evident from this.</p>

<h3>The Conscription Lottery Committee Was Established Yesterday and Decided to Hold the Conscription Lottery on the 23rd</h3>
<p>Those Found to Have Committed Fraud in the Transfer of Draftees Will Not Be Tolerated</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Conscription Association Lottery Committee held its inaugural meeting at the City Council at 10:45 yesterday morning. The attending members were Lu Yin-chu, Tong Xing-bai, Zhao Jun-hao, Zhou Xue-xiang, Chen Bao-hua, Hou Jun-ren, Zhao Yang-xiong, and the district chiefs of each district and the chairmen of the district people's representatives, a total of 41 people. Zhang Xiao-song, Lei Ke-nan, Tan Yi-min, and Yao Wen-ying also attended. Director Pan Gong-zhan presided over the meeting, announced the establishment of the committee, and reported on several points: (1) Last year, 3,000 conscripts were recruited, but 57 were still missing, failing to meet the quota. This year, they should be made up; (2) The methods of voluntary conscription and lottery will be adopted, and the two will be combined. Voluntary conscripts can offset the conscription quota; (3) According to orders, conscription will begin on April 1 and be completed by the end of June. All lottery work must be completed before the end of this month; (4) An indirect lottery method will be adopted (see page 4 of this newspaper on March 2). The Conscription Lottery Committee bears a heavy responsibility entrusted by current active and draft-age men. It is hoped that all lottery committee members will be on time to assist and supervise the lottery work on the day of the lottery implementation. Then, Zhang Xiao-song, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, stating: This city is implementing lottery conscription for the first time this year, and we have widely hired the heads of legal entities, schools, and district heads and chairmen of district people's representatives as lottery committee members, proceeding with caution. At the same time, because the implementation of lottery conscription involves as many as 170,000 draftees, we will definitely be frank and fair in promoting military administration. Mr. Zhang then announced that a certain district and a certain bao in this city, during the conscription process, under the circumstances where draft-age men were prohibited from applying for relocation, had approved the relocation of draftees without going through the application procedures, which was suspected of fraud. A staff member has been sent to investigate thoroughly. If it is found that there is indeed fraud, it will be sent to the court for the crime of undermining military administration. He solemnly announced here that these criminals will never be tolerated. Finally, Yao Wen-ying, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau, explained the indirect lottery method in detail and demonstrated the lottery in public. After discussion, it was decided to hold the lottery at the City Council at 2:00 pm on the 23rd.

Finally, various attendees raised a number of military administration issues, all of which were answered by Director Zhang one by one, and the meeting adjourned at noon.</p>

<h3>Residents of Gaoqiao District Request the Removal of the Donggou Town Oil Depot</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to request the removal of the oil depot in Donggou Town, residents of Gaoqiao District in this city have once again submitted a document to the City Government and relevant agencies, the general meaning of which is: The oil depot is extremely dangerous and should not be located in the densely populated Donggou Town. In the event of carelessness, or if the oil depot explodes due to war, the lives and property of the people of Pudong will be reduced to ashes. During the period of the Republic of China in the 17th year, Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, in view of this, convened leaders from all walks of life, and after more than a dozen meetings, it was resolved to move the Shan Pond to the Laoshu Sand at the mouth of the Huangpu River.

<h3>Conflict Occurred While Buying Tickets: Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company, Qingpu Station Completely Destroyed, Two People Beaten and Injured, Seven Culprits Detained, County Magistrate Liu Expresses Regret and Resolves to Punish Impartially</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning, Qingpu Station of the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company was suddenly attacked by seventy or eighty Qingpu County government employees, who completely destroyed the offices and parked buses within the station. Two people were beaten and injured. A reporter, traveling to Qingpu on one of the company's buses, obtained the following account: Some Qingpu County government employees had previously planned to organize a Qinghu automotive freight company. However, the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company did not agree at the time, citing its exclusive franchise on the Qinghu highway. Later, in order to avoid confusion when county government employees received preferential fares, the company required identification and the recording of passengers' names when purchasing tickets. County government employees considered this procedure overly troublesome and insulting, harboring resentment. Unexpectedly, at 9:25 AM yesterday, seventy or eighty employees from the County Government's Tax Bureau, Land Grain Bureau, Judicial Bureau, and Military Affairs Section attempted to take a bus to Shanghai. A conflict arose with station staff while buying tickets, which escalated into violence. Order collapsed, and all station staff fled and hid. As a result, the waiting room, ticket office, stationmaster's office, kitchen, and Bus No. 10, which was preparing to depart for Shanghai, along with indoor furniture, miscellaneous items, telephones, rice cookers, and bus windows and engines, were all destroyed. At that moment, Bus No. 110, the first bus from Shanghai, arrived. Before it could enter the city, it was overtaken by the group, who shattered all the windows. A female passenger named Zhang Cuiying, 27 years old, from Gao Huren, was injured in the head by broken glass and bled profusely. She was taken to the city's health hospital for treatment. Subsequently, led by a Mr. Yu, the group attempted to go to the company's headquarters in the city. When they reached Fuxing Bridge near Genchen Gate, a city defense patrol officer, Zhong, tried to dissuade them but was severely beaten and also sent to the hospital for treatment. After reaching the headquarters, the group further damaged maintenance vehicle No. 104 inside the gate. Yang Zhifan, the company's general affairs section chief (also a county assemblyman), heard the commotion and went out to stop them, but he was also slapped. Xu Jiwu, the township head of Baihe Township in Qingpu County, happened to be present and tried his best to persuade and mediate, and the group eventually dispersed. Fifteen minutes after the incident, Yuan, the chief of the County Police Bureau, arrived at the scene with over ten police officers to investigate. The company is currently assessing the losses and plans to submit a representation to the County Government, requesting compensation and guarantees for the company's future safety, along with a bayonet found at the station. The reporter then visited Liu Jin, the County Magistrate, to inquire about his opinion. During the meeting, he told the reporter with a very sorrowful expression: "I just returned from reporting my duties in the provincial capital the day before yesterday. After the suppression of Ding Feixi Shan's banditry in this county, we are making every effort to consolidate local security. At the same time, military service matters are urgently needed to be launched. I did not expect this incident to occur just one day later. I feel deeply saddened and ashamed, and I have nothing to say. Currently, the seven ringleaders of the incident, including Li Weixian, a staff member of the military affairs section (including four county government workers), have been detained. At the same time, I will report to my superiors and request punishment for myself. I guarantee that the perpetrators will be dealt with fairly, severely punished according to the law, and will not be treated with favoritism simply because they are my subordinates."</p>

<h3>Serial Crimes Committed by Bandits: All Nine Apprehended, Many Guns and Stolen Goods Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the New Cheng Police Sub-Bureau has recently seen a series of theft cases in the past month, in order to maintain local security, Zhao Peijin, the sub-bureau chief, and Ding Zhenduo, the deputy sub-bureau chief, have ordered their subordinates to patrol the辖区 day and night in groups. They also ordered Hao Jingyi, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to personally lead criminal police officers in disguise to infiltrate all levels of society, especially in places where bandits are likely to hide, to conduct detailed investigations, in the hope of discovering the faces of the bandits and solving the cases.</p>
<p>Disguised Investigation Yields Clues</p>
<p>Finally, at around 3:00 PM on the 6th, Gao Changbiao, a criminal investigation section officer, disguised as a peddler, was patrolling Xinzha Road when he caught sight of two men of medium stature riding in a rickshaw. Their faces were similar to the characteristics described by the victims in various theft cases. He immediately followed them and saw that the two men were looking around in the rickshaw, appearing quite flustered, which made them even more suspicious. He rushed forward, stopped the rickshaw, and interrogated them. They stammered and prevaricated, so they were taken to the bureau. The theft case victims, Qu Jinsheng and others, identified them without error, and they finally confessed. They revealed that one was named Dong Wencai, and the other was named Li Wensheng, and that there were other accomplices residing at Room 40 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. After the confession, Chief Hao immediately dispatched Liu Zhufeng, accompanied by police officers, to rush to the address and apprehend the bandit leader, Cha Shouren, who confessed that other accomplices were staying at No. 42 Heming Hotel on Guangdong Road. They apprehended bandits Pan Jinshan and Gu Baogen. Several gun parts were found in Pan's coat pocket. Later, at Room 30 on the third floor of No. 560 Huangpi Road, they found accomplices Zhang Ming and the receiver of stolen goods, Shen A'da (female). Two Shanghai-made pistols were found on the female bandit, and a disassembled .45 caliber pistol was found in the wardrobe. Following the confessions, officer Weng Yongquan led police to No. 8 Fuxing Lane, Qianjia Lane, Yuyuan Road, and arrested an accomplice named Chen Dafu. At 7:30 PM on the same day, officers who remained at the Huizhong Hotel continued to capture Cao Zhixing, a bandit who had brought back several pistol bullets from Pudong. By this point, a total of nine bandits, men and women, had been apprehended in this case. According to the bandit leader, Cha Shouren's confession, at approximately 4:30 AM on the 7th, officer Gu Qiliu and patrol officer Wang Jichuan ordered police chief Huang Yulin, Wan Jun, police officer Zhang Baichuan, and joined forces with Shen Kang and Feng Caixiong of the volunteer criminal police squad to go to the home of a bandit surnamed Cai in Huajia Lane, Caolu, Chuansha County, Pudong. They recovered one Type 38 rifle and two Italian-made rifles, which were brought back to Shanghai and presented as evidence.</p>
<p>Confessed to Committing Seventeen Cases</p>
<p>After separate and strict interrogations, all the bandits confessed that from October of last year until their arrest, they had committed as many as seventeen cases in succession: (1) Three rifles were robbed in Pudong in mid-October last year. (2) The house of Cheng Baoshan at No. 9 Zhangjiawan, Pudong, was robbed. (3) Pedestrians on Benqiao Road, Jinjiaqiao Lane, Pudong, were robbed.

<h3>Suspicious Death by Hanging: Coffin Exhumed for Examination</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At approximately 5:00 PM on the 13th, the Xujiahui Police Bureau received a tip-off that a Zhang family at No. 10, A, Lane 179, Tianping Road, was moving a coffin in a hurried manner, suggesting suspicion of murder. Police officers were dispatched to investigate and found that the family was burning joss paper inside the house. Zhang Hanqing, the head of the household, was taken to the bureau. He stated that he was 41 years old, from Shandong, and worked as a rickshaw puller. He confirmed that someone had died at around 8:00 AM today. The deceased was named Li Shirong, 21 years old, from Jiangxi, and was the son of his brother's wife, Zhang Zhengshi, from a previous marriage. He slept on the upper floor of a loft, and for some unknown reason, he hanged himself. His mother discovered him at 8:00 AM this morning, but he was already stiff. Because there were many people in the family, they had already bought a coffin, prepared the body, and transported the coffin to the Yizhong Cemetery of the Shandong Association on Jinji Road for burial. Zhang Zhengshi's statement was consistent with the above. The coffin of the deceased has now been exhumed from the burial site and sent to Tongren Fuyuantang to await the court's dispatch of personnel for examination, in order to facilitate the investigation.</p>
<h3>An Involved Party in the Xu Jizhuang Case: Sun Xiaojun Commits Suicide by Train in Wuxi: Three Suicide Notes Say He Feared Being Wrongfully Convicted: Declared He Only Received Salary and Did Not Receive Benefits from Peng and Xu</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi correspondent on the 14th] Sun Xiaojun, an involved party in the embezzlement case of Xu Jizhuang, the former director of the China Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, was afraid of being prosecuted. He returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, got off the train in this county midway, and committed suicide by lying on the railway tracks. He had a suicide note beside him, saying that he did not receive any benefits from Xu and others and that he feared being wrongfully convicted if he turned himself in. His words were very impassioned and desperate. The deceased, Sun Xiaojun, was 47 years old and from Nanjing. He had served as a specialist in the Liquid Fuel Management Committee of the Transportation Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission. After meeting Xu Jizhuang, he became Xu's trusted aide, holding full power over the Bashan Bank and the Far East Trading Company. When Xu Jizhuang's embezzlement case occurred last year, it was reported by the Jiangsu Inspectorate and repeatedly investigated by the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, which filed a public prosecution. Sun was also included as a defendant, and he abandoned his post from then on. However, Sun's businesses were mostly in Shanghai, and many things needed to be handled personally. Moreover, his wife, Zhou, still worked at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and his children were also studying in Shanghai. Therefore, Sun dared not turn himself in nor did he want to leave Shanghai. Furthermore, Sun had a wide circle of friends in peacetime, and recently, his friends in distress kept demanding loans, taking whatever they wanted. Sun suffered from being unable to refuse them, and he also feared being imprisoned. Under these circumstances, the thought of ending his life was not new. On the 12th, after Sun handled the funeral of his brother, Jifu, in Beijing, he took his nephew, Jiang Qingyu, by overnight train to Shanghai. At this time, Sun had already made up his mind to commit suicide. When the train passed Wuxi Station, it was dark and quiet. Sun quietly got off the train and lay down on the railroad tracks when a train from Shanghai to Beijing passed by. By the time he was discovered, he had already been crushed to death. At that time, Jiang Qingyu had already reached Suzhou Station. He could not find Xiaojun in the train and saw the suicide note, knowing that something had happened. He urgently called Wuxi Station to inquire and learned that he had committed suicide in Wuxi. He immediately came to Wuxi and jointly reported to the District Prosecutor's Office. When his wife, Zhou, received the call, she also rushed to Wuxi and bought a coffin. Now, Sun Xiaojun's suicide note is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Words at Death: Intense and Tragic</p>
<p>Suicide Note (1): Dear Sister Hua, my dearest virtuous wife, you will surely be saddened to know of my tragic death, but you must know that everyone will eventually die. I was destined to die, and I am not good at arguing. Moreover, my nerves and heart are weak. After surrendering myself, I would inevitably be unable to withstand interrogation or torture, or even be wrongfully convicted. Even if that were not the case, I only received a salary and did not receive any benefits from Peng and Xu. Apart from your current job to support you, my honesty will inevitably make me a criminal. Even if I was imprisoned for three days, I would die of anger, and if I fled far away, I would suffocate to death. Moreover, I would forever suffer injustice, which is not worth it. Furthermore, Fang Lin may push me into a trap, leaving me at his mercy. His part (Peng was the mastermind) of the crimes was not done by me. He once showed me a document of sending money to Xu Jizhuang and others. Rather than dying of anger and suffocation, I would rather die by falling on the tracks and committing seppuku with the spirit of Bushido. In this way, my spirit can ascend to heaven and not go to hell. In this way, my wife, children, and family can still be good people. I hope my son will become the world's greatest scientist and do things that benefit the country and save the people. If so, I will be proud, and I can die peacefully. The other children are still young, but each has their own future. The three and five families, with five sons and three daughters, although they are divided, I hope they will help each other. You can discuss with the eldest grandfather about using your hard-earned salary to join the Xiehao shares, which may provide a living. I hope that the job at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will not be cut. It would be even better if you could get my job and then transfer to any location you want. In this way, I will be comforted when I go to heaven. My spirit will always protect you and love you. I was originally very painful, but now I feel relieved. Please restrain your grief and adapt to the change. Your health is important. Do not harm yourself with grief. My house can be sold for 4,000 [unclear]. My death is going to heaven, not hell. You must take the long view. Please ask Yinglin and others to take care of the orphans in the Yangzhu Lane house. Suicide Note (2) Please Inspect Again, Ronglin: A dying man speaks the truth, and since I have been loyal and honest all my life, my words are even more sincere. As a dying man speaking the truth, I would like to inform you that the small box in my house that should be handed over but has not been (because there is no heir) only contains the "Bachuan" and "Yuanyang" directors' seals and business licenses. My wife does not know the truth, please do not mistakenly accuse her. Suicide Note (3) Mother-in-law, older and younger mothers, elder brother and sister, siblings, I know that although they are not blood-related sisters, they are like flesh and blood, and all my nephews and nieces, you all love me, do not grieve my death, I hope you will be open-minded and recognize that I am going to heaven, and there will be comfort. Please take care of my orphans. Goodbye! Wishing you good health, not writing separately to relatives and friends.</p>
<h3>Qibao Agricultural School Hosts Visit</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Qibao Vocational Agricultural School hosted a visit from the press yesterday. The school began preparations in May 1947, and after only three months, it began enrollment and classes in August of the same year. In addition to using the original Jade Emperor and City God Temples in Qibao Town, two new buildings have been built. There are currently 152 students and 20 faculty and staff members.

<h3>Wages to Be Settled According to Last Month's Index: Shanghai General Labor Union Voted to Oppose Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai General Labor Union held its 41st council meeting and the joint meeting of the Construction Committee Foundation Management Committee yesterday morning. Eighteen people attended, including Shui Xiangyun, Ye Xianggao, Liang Yongzhang, Fang Rusheng, and Chou Changjiang. Chairman Shui chaired the meeting. First, the drawings of the meeting venue prepared by nine construction factories were reviewed. After careful selection by the committee members, they unanimously agreed that the drawings from Zhongyi Factory were the most practical and approved their adoption. Then, the discussion focused on the recent request from the Industrial Association to the government to stipulate that monthly wages should be settled according to the cost of living index of the previous month. All the council members present expressed their opposition. It was resolved to submit a document to the responsible agency, asking that it not be adopted. Finally, on behalf of 520,000 workers in the city, a telegram was sent to U.S. Ambassador to China Stuart, U.S. Consul General to Shanghai Cabot, President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, Speakers of the House and Senate, and the Foreign Affairs Committee, Appropriations Committee, and Military Committee of the House and Senate, appealing to them to immediately provide military and economic aid to China.</p>
<h3>Commercial Competition Intensifies Daily: Roadside Advertisements Soar, Empty Walls and Rooftops Becoming Excellent Bases; 200 Square Feet Exceeds 50 Million in Value</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The astonishing number of roadside advertisements in Shanghai and the rapid advancement of production techniques powerfully illustrate that today's commercial competition has reached a fever pitch. Starting from posters like "Dog Skin Plaster for Sale, Specializing in Treating Traumatic Injuries," in just over a decade, advertising has spread from wall corners and streets to every available space. In the eyes of businessmen, no blank wall, incredibly high dangerous building, important construction, or eye-catching place is not an excellent base for their "advertising war."</p>
<p>Among these, Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, the Bund, Avenue Joffre, and Xizang Road, due to their dense population, are naturally the most intensely contested advertising areas for various commercial firms and companies. However, some have unique ideas, abandoning the city and focusing on remote rural areas. For example, "White Snow" advertisements are mostly scattered around Caojiadu, Wujiaochang, and Caohejing, while "Wuzhou Gubenzao" has erected 50,000 feet of roadside advertising signs along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, penetrating deep into Yixing, Liyang, and other counties. Some aim to attract urban crowds, while others strive to win over rural customers. Although the regions differ, their desire to attract more customers is the same.</p>
<p>Tiny Wall Space, Considerable Rent</p>
<p>It is not a simple task for advertising companies to erect advertising signs for clients in various locations. Even for a small space on a wall, they must first lease it from the landowner. The transfer fee and rent are like renting a house. In the city, prices are quoted in gold bars or US dollars, while in the countryside, they are calculated in rice and grain. The advertising signs that stretch for miles alongside the racetrack require advertising companies to pay a considerable monthly fee to the Shanghai Race Club. The attractive grassy advertisements on both sides of the Ciro's dance hall also charge advertisers substantial ground rent. Many residents are fortunate to be favored by advertisers who wish to use a corner of their wall for advertising, and these residents' monthly income may be several times more than the rent from leasing an entire house.</p>
<p>Four Small Windows Reduce Wind Force</p>
<p>What advertising merchants fear the most is a sudden typhoon. Roadside advertising signs bear the brunt and are naturally vulnerable. In the past, during storms, roadside signs often broke and were uprooted, resulting in considerable losses. Now, they have come up with a solution: opening four small windows in the center of the roadside sign. These are usually closed tightly, appearing seamless, but when a strong wind rises, the small doors are shaken open, significantly reducing wind resistance and avoiding disaster.</p>
<p>Advertising merchants usually put a lot of effort into communicating with and dealing with lower-level figures and behind-the-scenes forces in various sections of the city. The most important thing for advertising signs is to be beautiful, and they must avoid being smeared or damaged. Especially at night when there is no one to guard them, it is even more difficult to prevent petty thieves from stealing. Therefore, expenses for holidays are particularly generous. It is said that this tacit form of transaction is quite effective. Now, each 200-square-foot advertising sign is worth over 50 million, and if there is any mistake, the advertising merchant will naturally risk incurring losses.</p>
<p>Freehand Drawing, Accurate to the Millimeter</p>
<p>The life of an advertising sign lies in the drawing of the design. The best paint for drawing is German-made, followed by British goods. Although American paint has bright colors, it is not durable. Generally, advertising merchants and clients sign contracts for roadside signs for a period of six months. Except for movie advertisements, the rest are rarely changed, so they must choose durable paint colors. There are also craftsmen who draw the designs. They have not received any art training. As long as they look at a piece of soap or a can of cigarettes, they can draw it accurately to the millimeter on a hundred-foot hanging wall, whether it is small or large. They usually paint a 300-400 foot drawing with a dozen colors in just two days. Their skilled techniques enable them to earn over 40 to 50 million.</p>
<p>Loyalty and Villainy, Each Resembling Their Character</p>
<p>The most profound expression of wisdom and spirituality is the drawing of movie advertisements. The faces of so-called "stars" are known to everyone, not like drawing gods never seen by anyone on the kitchen stove in the countryside. It is a very difficult task to accurately, vividly, and beautifully transfer a photo onto a three-dimensional roadside sign. It is said that there are only four or five people in Shanghai who can handle this kind of work, and Zhao Xikui is the best of them. A "Night Shop" advertisement at the intersection of Avenue Foch has nearly twenty "stars" who are all well-known figures. Their beauty, ugliness, loyalty, and villainy each resemble their character. Each of their faces is radiant, which has been praised by many passersby. This is Zhao Xikui's masterpiece.</p>
<p>A Piece of Grassland, Cleverly Arranged</p>
<p>According to precise surveys, there are now more than 2,500 advertising signs in Shanghai, and cigarette advertisements account for 35%. These advertisements are distributed inside and outside the city, on rooftops and walls, almost without exception, and are visible everywhere you look up. Currently, due to the limited space in the city, roadside advertising has begun to develop to other cities, and they have appeared successively along both roads. Strictly speaking, Shanghai's advertising has progressed from "roadside signs" to "landed" advertisements. A piece of grassland is opened up by the roadside, cleverly arranging a few geese, a few large cigarette cans, and a few lanterns, so that people on the road feel the temptation of these things at their feet. Take a closer look, friends! What they hope is that you will take another look!</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 11th] Due to the full-scale suppression by the National Army in the past and the successive southward escape to Central China by the remaining main forces of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi, Jinan, which has been the heart of Shandong for more than half a year, has been able to maintain a relatively stable and small-scale well-being.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Jinan had a population of only over 300,000. After the victory, due to the difficulties created by the Communists and the smoke of war spreading throughout Shandong, refugees from various counties crowded into Jinan, Qingdao, and other cities, resulting in Jinan's population reaching a maximum of 800,000. Since the second opening of the Jiaoji Railway's Jin-Wei section last autumn, followed by the official repair and opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's Xu-Ji section in December, although the people gathered in Jinan have been partially dispersed, the remaining atmosphere is still not cleared up, and a large area of various villages and towns is still under the control of local Eighth Route Armies. Therefore, the city's population, excluding the military, has always maintained a record of over 600,000 to 700,000.</p>
<p>"The people regard food as heaven." The most serious issue after the increase in population is naturally the grain problem. According to statistics from the Shandong Construction Department: there are seven flour mills in Jinan, and if their production capacity is fully utilized, they can produce 700,000 bags of flour per month, requiring 200,000 bags of wheat, which is just enough for the entire city of Jinan. However, at present, due to the blockade of the four rural areas by the Communists, the source of wheat is short, and only a quarter of it is produced per month, that is, more than 170,000 bags, requiring 50,000 bags of wheat. In addition, even when coarse grains are included in the calculation, the average daily amount of food imported into Jinan City from other counties is no more than 3,000 bags, totaling 90,000 bags per month, which is only enough for two-thirds of the current population of Jinan City to eat. (Coarse grains consume very little when ground into powder). Although there are no accurate statistics on the original grain reserves in Jinan City, under such supply and demand conditions, the rise in food prices is naturally a matter of course. From mid-December of last year, when the price of first-class flour (44 city catties) was 500,000 per bag, to early February (the end of the lunar year), it broke through the 1 million mark. By early March, the black market price of flour rose again to 1.8 million per bag. Although it is currently hovering around 1.5 million, this price obviously cannot be maintained for long. As for millet flour, one of the coarse grains, the current market price has also reached 2 million per 100 city catties. According to Jinan Mayor Wang Chongwu, at least half of the 700,000 people in Jinan are refugees, and at least 200,000 of these 350,000 refugees rely on relief to maintain their lives. The light luggage that the refugees could only carry when they left their hometowns could not withstand the long-term consumption of more than two years, and most of them were sitting idle and facing desperation. The original number of public school personnel in the directly affiliated and affiliated organs of the Shandong Provincial Government was more than 4,700. Under such heavy pressure of high prices, they were already on the verge of death. In December, the Jinan City price index calculated by the Shandong Provincial Bank reached more than 180,000 times. However, the central government listed Jinan as the third level, other counties in Shandong as the fourth level, and only Qingdao City as the first level. This not only made the public school personnel in Jinan City unable to "live," "die," "be born," or "get sick," especially the public school personnel who risked their lives at any time to serve in the recovered areas where the remaining atmosphere was not cleared up. The treatment they received was even lower, so low that it was not only impossible to "support a family," but even "making a living" became a problem. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to talk about rewarding outstanding and promising personnel to go to the recovered areas to compete with the bandits in politics, economy, culture, and education.</p>
<p>In peacetime, government agencies proliferated one after another. Once the government's expenses are huge and income is not enough, they ignore life and death, summarize and generalize, and issue an order to limit local governments to cut staff by 25% within five months (February to June). Although this is also a problem in the rear, the problem should not be as profound and serious as in the pacification zone. Take Jinan as an example: there are already enough refugees and unemployed people, and the treatment of the original public school personnel is already bitter enough. However, even this bit of life is to be destroyed. The civil servants who are laid off have no place to go. Therefore, this simply made Chairman Wang Jianu feel distressed. He wanted not to cut staff, but the central government did not care about anything and began to deduct 30% of the funds from February, so he had to start cutting staff by 10% from early March. Other military organs (such as the pacification area) and party affairs organs also have to cut staff, especially the party affairs organs, where the number of people laid off reached 80% of the original staff.</p>
<p>According to personnel who recently escaped from the "Liberated Area," the Communists, in order to "reduce the burden on the people, implement drought preparedness and disaster relief, produce savings, ensure land reform, and strive for the final victory of the self-defense war," issued eight "prohibitions," of which the third is "Stop expanding the army, and in the future, without the decision of the military region or the provincial government, no one shall be mobilized to join the army again." He also told me: "The Communists have set up reception centers in all 'Liberated Areas' and on the boundary lines of the National Army's recovered areas to welcome refugees who have escaped to return to their hometowns. In the past, the Communists did not allow landlords to return to their hometowns, and returning to their hometowns was punishable by death. However, this year, their policy has changed. Landlords can also guarantee their safety when they return to their hometowns. They still issue one mu of land per person according to the population. In the first three months, the bandits supply two city catties of food per day, issued once every ten days, and then sell it at the expiration date." He solemnly told me: "Only 30 miles away from Jinan, the Communists have set up a large reception center in Sangzidian on the north bank of the Yellow River, especially emphasizing that they welcome government employees who have been laid off to go to the 'Liberated Area.' They are responsible for guaranteeing and protecting their work."</p>
<p>At the same time, in Jinan, I don't know how many middle and lower-level civil servants have said to me: "In the past, what we ate every day was wowotou (corn bread). When we were eating wowotou, we could still compare ourselves to 'holding gold nuggets in our hands' and get some spiritual satisfaction. Today, even a family of five civil servants of the first rank have problems eating wowotou!"</p>
<p>This series of problems cannot be solved by the strength of the local government alone. If the central government does not address the special environment of the pacification zone, adapt to the special needs of the pacification zone, earnestly improve the treatment of staff, reward a large number of outstanding youths to go to the recovered areas to engage in political, economic, cultural, educational, and other competitions with the bandits in order to achieve the true mission of "total war," and does not allow the transportation of grain from the south to the north in order to enrich the source of grain, and allocate a large number of food loans to purchase grain and transport it to Shandong; and does not allocate a part of the 1.2 million tons of American relief food to Shandong to help alleviate the serious spring famine in Shandong; and does not stop layoffs, and instead of giving relief after the layoffs, it is better not to lay off staff to enhance their work efficiency; then, in order to fight for the most basic survival, the people will inevitably drink poison to quench their thirst and be confused by the one-sided propaganda of the Communists. Liu Xiang, the Director of the Shandong People's Department, said well: "Even in terms of layoffs, it is at most a social problem in other places, but in the pacification zone, it has become a serious political problem."

<h3>The Shandong Women's Legislative Election Dispute, Which Caused a Sensation, Comes to an End</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 12th] The Shandong women's legislative election dispute has attracted widespread attention from all over the country since it occurred. Now, Ms. Chen Jiujing, the wife of Shandong Education Director, who participated in the election with the participation of social figures and received many votes, has expressed her willingness to give up the right to run for the Legislative Yuan after being persuaded by Chairman Wang Jianu Yaowu and others. At the same time, Ms. Lü Yunzhang, a member of the Central Committee and a member of the Senate, who participated in the legislative election, deeply admires Ms. Chen's move. The talks between Ms. Lü and Ms. Chen are recorded below. This Shandong election dispute, which caused a sensation, should come to an end here!</p>
<p>Lü Yunzhang's talk: My purpose in participating in this legislative election is to obtain a speaking position in the Legislative Yuan. Legislative Yuan members are not officials, but people's representatives. Therefore, running for the Legislative Yuan is not so much a personal right as it is an obligation to the people. Unfortunately, I am very sorry for offending friends because of the election. I am very grateful for the assistance of people from all walks of life. I recently heard that Ms. Chen Jiujing declared to Chairman Wang that she would give up her right to be elected to the Legislative Yuan, expressing her concession. This kind of humble demeanor is not only admired by Yunzhang personally, but also leaves a good example for Shandong society and the future of elections. Yunzhang and Ms. Jiujing were originally classmates and have a very close friendship. The misunderstanding that occurred in this election was due to false rumors and caused estrangement. Now, after being explained by friends, the two sides have completely dissolved their differences and will never affect the friendship between the two of us due to a temporary misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Chen Jiujing's talk: I recently read an article published by Ms. Lü Yunzhang in various newspapers in the city (i.e., the one mentioned above), which is largely inconsistent with the facts. My attitude in participating in this election has been consistent from beginning to end, and I have not changed in the slightest due to any resistance. Since I have decided to run for election, how can I give up my right to be elected? In the past half month, because of the election, Ms. Lü Yunzhang disregarded everything and published news fabricated facts in various newspapers, and then published it in the Dahua Daily. The so-called photo of Ms. Li Yang was intended to cover up her fabricated facts, confuse the hearing, and intended to damage the reputation of my husband Li Taihua and insult my personal personality. Since Ms. Lü has destroyed the friendship so much, although Chairman Wang instructed friends to mediate a few days ago, I believe that the issue of concession cannot be discussed until the friendship between the two sides is restored. My husband submitted a resignation and planned to deal with Ms. Lü in the capacity of a private citizen, but Chairman Wang dissuaded him, so it is inconvenient to have any other expressions. As for the issue of giving up the Legislative Yuan, it will be easily resolved after the election results are announced. Because Ms. Lü is my old senior, if I can be elected, it is not impossible to give up to her.</p>
<p>Lü Yunzhang took the Tianjin-Pukou Express train to Beijing and then to Shanghai on the morning of the 12th of this month to treat her eye disease. Since the occurrence of this case, Li Yingchang Taihua has not gone to the department to work since the 10th and has formally submitted his resignation to Chairman Wang, but it is heard that Chairman Wang believes that Li has made many contributions to Shandong in the past two years and decided to retain him.

<h3>Haining Land Collapse: Waves Splashing and Stirring Up a Strange Joy</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Haining, Our Newspaper, 13th] The rising sand on the sea embankment outside the South Gate of Haining County has reached a flat surplus, and sea transportation has been cut off. The commercial depression in the urban and rural areas has made it impossible to carry out various constructions, so the people all hope that the sand will collapse as soon as possible in order to seek revival. At present, the sand and soil on the embankment have risen to a height of one zhang, and they are only a foot or so away from the embankment. Looking from a distance, it is a plain of yellow sand, and vehicles often come and go. These days, it is the time of high tide, and the sand collapse is accelerating. When the tide comes, the sound of the sand collapse is loud. Looking from a distance into the river, the waves are splashing, forming a strange scene, just like a group of machines bombing the position. According to those who are familiar with the tide, the sand will collapse very easily in the recent situation, and the view can be restored in the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. The "Haining Tide" will still be praised by the world.</p>

<h3>Re-election of National Assembly Representatives in Changhua</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Changhua, Our Newspaper, 12th] After the Changhua County National Assembly representatives were ruled invalid by the Zhejiang High Court, the county election office was ordered to actively prepare for re-election and has set the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month as the re-election dates. Candidate Wang Xuequan came to the county from Shanghai a few days ago to visit the elders of each district. Another candidate, Chen Yi (the current Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Food and Grain Department), also transferred dozens of Changhua-born grain administration personnel back to his hometown half a month ago to run around for him. He himself returned to Changhua in his own small jeep a few days ago to preside over the process. Now, there are only a few days left before the election date. According to what the reporter has learned: this election is not as turbulent as the previous one, and there is less textual propaganda. However, the situation of threats and inducements is still undiminished from the previous one in various villages. I recently learned that Wang Xuequan, in view of the increasingly deteriorating election atmosphere, published a general letter to the elders of the county, firmly expressing his intention to give up the election. Judging from its content, it seems that there are infinite emotions. The original letter is recorded below: "Xuequan is humbled by his talent, and is honored to be sincerely loved and cared for by the elders of each district. He resolutely participated in the previous National Assembly election in Changhua. Afterwards, due to the county election office's violation of the law and other relations, our Changhua election did not have a good result, which is a major stain on the history of constitutionalism. This time, the Zhejiang High Court ruled for a re-election. Xuequan, in view of the unwavering love and care of the elders of each district, came back again to prepare for a second election. However, rumors and whispers have been spreading in recent days, and the power of the evil has spread all over. I deeply know that many elders are suffering in such an environment. I deeply understand this. If I burden the public again with my own body, it is unbearable, and I am unwilling to be a sinner of democracy. After repeated consideration, I have decided to give up the election. If the elders are determined to love and care for me and still vote for Xuequan, then Xuequan will also regard it as the supreme glory and be grateful. I hope that my humble heart will be enlightened." After reading it, fair people in general in each district and village expressed their sympathy.

<h3>Xie Shou Kang Gives Lecture on the Overview of European and American Literature and Art</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Municipal Literary Writers Association, the Shanghai Art Association, the Cultural Movement Committee, and the Youth Hall jointly invited Mr. Xie Shou Kang, the former envoy to the Holy See and a member of the Belgian Royal Academy of Literature, to give a lecture yesterday titled "Overview of European and American Literature and Art". Mr. Xie briefly stated: After World War I, the social economy recovered very quickly, and the literature and art after the war also bloomed like flowers, dazzling and dazzling. The situation after this war is the opposite of the previous one. People are wandering and have nowhere to live. They are pursuing in distress but are very interested in Chinese literature and art. Now the world is in poverty. Except for the United States, which is wealthy, other countries are in recession. The sales of literary and artistic works are also a problem. It can be said that the barrenness has no source; some people have turned to look at the distant Far East with envy. Recently, France also feels that it cannot live in its own country and wants to come to China. This kind of depression is everywhere. China attracts people's attention, and European ancient culture is also influenced by China, such as the Italian Renaissance. Important figures in modern French culture have been influenced by Chinese literature and philosophy. According to Mr. Xie, after the victory, due to the death of Deng Zhenan, a senior member of the Belgian Royal Academy of Literature, Xie was elected by public vote to take his place. This is also a great honor for China in the overseas literary and art circles.</p>

<h3>World Games Football Preliminary Round Proceeds Smoothly in Hong Kong. The Representative Team Will Leave the Country on the 10th of Next Month. The Preliminary Competition Will Feature Java as the Opponent.</h3>
<p>[Our city news] Dong Shouyi, the Secretary-General of the Chinese National Sports Federation, and Rong Qizhao, the Chairman of the World Games Football Selection Committee, flew to Hong Kong on the 5th of this month to cooperate with the Hong Kong selection committee in handling the selection matters for China's participation in the 14th London World Games football selection. It is now learned that Dong returned to Shanghai by plane from Hong Kong on the 11th. According to Dong, this selection was jointly handled by Cai Huihong, Chairman of the Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese National Sports Federation, and relevant parties. The results were exceptionally satisfactory. Participants in the selection competition included Java, Kowloon Chinese United, and Zhu Zhicheng (goalkeeper) and Xie Wenliang (right winger) selected by Singapore. On the 9th, 11th, and 16th of this month, three games were held separately with Java as the main body. The two representatives from Singapore joined the Chinese United team to compete. Once the final preliminary round on the 16th is completed, the list of candidates for the World Games football team can be determined by the entire selection committee, and the team is scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the 10th of next month after completing preparations. It is also learned that Dong has repeatedly consulted with Hu Wenhu and his son in Hong Kong on matters related to the football team's departure.</p>
<p>Java Chinese are very popular in Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong air report] The selection of World Games football representatives is causing a stir in Hong Kong. Dong Shouyi, Rong Qizhao, and Yu Hengzhi arrived in Hong Kong, and the Java team, led by Zhang Huaijin, also arrived in Hong Kong with 20 players to participate in the election for the World Games representative quota. In order to thank the Java team for their enthusiasm for returning to the country (the players' travel expenses were all pooled from their own savings), they received a wide welcome. In addition to the South China Athletic Association hosting their accommodation, the local Sports Association Branch, South China, and Sing Tao also held banquets to entertain them separately, and private individuals such as Chen Rongbai and Tang Xuanqing also held banquets.</p>
<p>However, while the selection competition is proceeding smoothly, there have been many unpleasant news. The biggest obstacles are the issue of funding for going abroad and whether the selected players are willing to depart with the military. Combining the opinions of all parties, the departure of the World Games football team is still subject to change.</p>
<p>This time, the Sports Association Branch arranged three competition schedules for the Java team to perform in Hong Kong. The first match was against Hong Kong Chinese United, held on the 9th (Tuesday). The second match was against Kowloon Chinese United, held on the 11th (Thursday). The third match was against Hong Kong West United, held on the 16th (Tuesday). The venues were all at the South China Jia Shan Field, and ticket prices were 5 yuan, 3.5 yuan, and 2.4 yuan. After the Java team completes its matches in Hong Kong, it will fly to Bangkok for a tour-style competition. If time permits, it will make a trip to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fans Packed</p>
<p>The 9th was the first battle, with Hong Kong Chinese United lined up to meet the enemy. Perhaps this was a new stimulus. The game started at 5:00 PM, but fans started arriving in droves after 3:00 PM, packing the South China Field. The income was统计ed at more than 14,000 yuan, which is not a bad number. As a result of the match, Hong Kong United showed better skills, winning three goals in the first half and adding another one in the second half, with four goals to nil against Java. The lineups of the two teams during the match were as follows:</p>
<p>(Hong Kong United Team)</p>
<p>Tan Junqian, Zeng Zhongyun, Hou Rongsheng, Tan Huanzhang, Zhang Jinhai, Liu Songsheng, Xie Jinhe, Li Zhaorong, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, He Yingfen</p>
<p>(Java Team)</p>
<p>Wang Wenqing, Wang Liangde, Cai Ruichang, Wu Changhe, Zhang Mingkun, Huang Shuangquan, Guo Hongcheng, Luo Tianxiu, Hu Jinli, Chen Yun, Gao Jinquan</p>
<p>Hong Kong United Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Hong Kong team had regular players Lin Rushun, Song Lingsheng, Chen Dehui, and Zhu Yongqiang unable to play due to injuries. Zeng Zhongyun, Tan Huanzhang, Li Zhaorong, and Xie Jinhe were temporarily substituted. Captain Feng Jingxiang chose a favorable wind direction. The Java team kicked off, and the first few kicks were quite decent. Four minutes passed, and Yingfen got the ball and rushed up, passing it back to the mountain road. Songsheng intercepted it from 25 yards out and scored a goal, and Wenqing was caught off guard. Hong Kong United scored the first point.</p>
<p>Three Goals in a Row</p>
<p>In the second battle, Yingfen and Jingxiang advanced again. Yingfen aimed at the goal, and Yingqi flashed in and headed the ball, hitting the post and bouncing out. After eleven minutes, the two players on the right advanced again, passing each other deep into the penalty area. Yingfen passed the ball to Jingxiang, and the "divine leg" rose, making it 2 to 0. Continuing the melee, the visiting team launched a fierce counterattack, forcing a 12-yard penalty kick. Luo Tianxiu hosted the guests. After 32 minutes, Jinhe advanced from the left and sent the ball horizontally to the right. Jingxiang gently touched it, causing it to fall at the feet of Zhaorong. The "Buddha" quickly抽ed it, making it 3 to 0. Hong Kong United had an absolute advantage in the first half.</p>
<p>After a short break, Java played better than in the first half. Hong Kong United only scored a free kick by Liu Songsheng, while Java fought hard but failed to break the duck egg in the end. Hong Kong United then defeated the Java team by a score of 4 to 0.</p>
<p>Judging the Java Chinese Team</p>
<p>Looking at the entire game, Hong Kong Chinese United had an above-average performance. The forwards Feng Jingxiang and He Yingfen played the best, and defender Zhang Jinhai was the most outstanding. What about the Java team? Left-winger Guo Hongcheng was good, and both defenders had a chance to perform, but the midfield was too weak. Although the forwards had strength in their feet, they did not have a way to shoot. The most disadvantaged part was not understanding Hong Kong United's style of play. This is where the Java team is far inferior to the Hong Kong United. The attack in the front was not organized, and there was no certainty in fighting for headers, but they liked to use high balls to advance, so the opposing team had a chance to advance, but they couldn't shoot at all. But from the perspective of combat spirit, it is worthy of praise. Although they lost four goals, they remained consistent throughout, which is the most exciting thing.</p>

<h3>Bitter Battle at Jianqiao Air Force Ends in Defeat; Last Night's Loss to Oncas; Today's Farewell Battle Against Lianqing</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Hangzhou Jianqiao Air Force Military Academy basketball team came to Shanghai for an expedition. Last night, in their second match, they encountered the strong local Western team Oncas. After a hard-fought battle, they were defeated 53-28. In the first half, the Air Force school trailed 12-25. Oncas' offense was fierce, and their players were tall. The Air Force fought bravely but was no match. The gymnasium was quite crowded, with an estimated audience of over 1,000 people. Tonight, the Air Force school will have its final battle against the Lianqing team, a new force formed by Chengyou, Renyu, and Yuxun of this city. The battle report from last night is as follows:</p>
<p>The Air Force presented flags as a courtesy before the match began. The Air Force school gained the initial advantage. Xu Weiyuan's momentum was strong, but Oncas' Bowley and Cairo Siqi were active for a time, quickly turning the score to 14-6. The Air Force school's biggest problem was that they "couldn't break through." They lingered in the half-court, within sight but out of reach, and fell behind all the way. The foreign soldiers swaggered, making it 24-9. Within 15 minutes, the situation had become dire. The first half ended 25-12. In the second half, Oncas implemented a rotational strategy. Their tall stature further aided their shooting. Although the Air Force school tried hard to advance in the final ten minutes, it was too late, and the game ended with a score of 53-28.</p>

<h3>Dagong's Hard-Fought Victory Over Qingbai</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] In last night's Group A first division of the Basketball League, Dagong had a hard-fought victory over Qingbai. The first half ended in a 28-point tie, with evenly matched strength. The final score was 56-52.</p>
<p>Dagong versus Qingbai began at 6:30 PM. After the opening, it was difficult to separate the two teams. After much effort, the first half ended in a 28-point tie. When the second half began, Cai Wenhua and Tu Wenlong repeatedly scored skillfully from the right of the basket. Qingbai's Xu Hengyan was still able to cope, making it 39-37.

<h3>General Prices: The Vicious Cycle Intensifies; Hope for Swift Measures to Break It</h3>
<p>The fierce wave of price increases after the Lunar New Year had slightly eased in the previous week. It seemed that the price fluctuations had completed a cycle and should enter a period of rest, at least for about a week, following the tightening of credit at the end of the previous week. However, the actual development of events was unexpectedly surprising. Although credit remained tight last week, interbank lending among money traders became more frequent, and price fluctuations became more intense again. This indicates that the tightening of credit at the end of the previous week was merely a phenomenon of relative shortage of payment chips after a sharp rise in prices, and not the effect of a large surplus injected by national banks. Although the surplus in the previous week reached 119.98 billion yuan, more than half of it was injected by the Central Bank, and more than half of the National Bank's injection was fixed deposits from other banks. Other income, such as coal, sugar, and taxes, also accounted for only half. Last week's surplus was 89.61 billion, which cannot be considered small, but the situation was similar to the previous week. Therefore, although the weekly surplus is large, it cannot promote tight credit. Instead, after a sharp rise in prices, credit may tighten accordingly, but this is still a natural result brought about by the sharp rise in prices, with less pressure from active human intervention. This is precisely what patriotic and concerned individuals feel is the most worrisome aspect of the future, because prices are constantly completing a cycle of rising and leveling off, and credit is tightening and loosening intermittently. Then, after a short period of rest, a second cycle follows. The momentum is becoming more and more intense, and the cycle is becoming shorter and shorter. This is a vicious cycle, a malignant tumor in the national economy. If this series of cycles cannot be broken, and this malignant tumor cannot be removed, then its future is something that patriotic and concerned individuals cannot bear to speak of plainly. However, according to the facts, not to mention the distant past, this series of vicious cycles has only been repeated endlessly with acceleration since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. We hereby reiterate a fervent hope that the wise financial authorities will no longer make any minor facilities, but will quickly cut off this series of vicious cycles in the late stage of hyperinflation. If this series of vicious cycles cannot be cut off, the effectiveness of any minor facilities will probably not be as ideal. Because the severity of the economic situation has reached a decisive stage, we cannot help but issue an ardent appeal. As for the method of cutting off this series of vicious cycles, it is impossible to discuss it in detail here. According to the wholesale price index classified by the use of goods compiled by this association, the increase in the two weeks after the Lunar New Year was 71%, which was a fierce wave of price increases. However, the situation had already eased in the previous week. At the end of the previous week, credit tightened and prices uniformly reported declines. It seemed that the past week should have continued the stability of a certain period of time amidst the sound of tight credit. However, the large influx of hot money from North China and Northeast China, especially the large inflow of Northeast circulating coupons into the interior, caused a sharp increase in the currency in the interior in the short term. According to the statistics of the Tianjin Financial Administration, the inflow of Northeast circulating coupons into the interior in the second half of last month reached more than 460 billion. This city is of course greatly affected. Therefore, although credit tightened last week after a sharp rise in prices due to the sharp rise in prices, the funds in this city did not appear to be short due to the continuous inflow of a large amount of hot money. Interbank lending among various banks and firms was frequent, and as a result, prices rose again, with a momentum that was more fierce than in the previous three weeks. The number of goods reaching new highs was countless. Forty-two count Blue Phoenix rose 18% in a single day on Tuesday, reaching a maximum of 180 million in a week. The leading Longtou fine cloth rose 13% on the same day, reaching a maximum of 3.73 million in a week. The highest price of high-quality white japonica rice on Thursday reached 3.88 million, with retail sales reaching 4.1 million. 120 count A-character Tianqiao rayon rose 17% in a single day on Wednesday, with the highest price reaching 238 million. Factory counties exceeded 300 million. At the weekend, credit tightened again in the morning and prices fell. However, the National Bank injected a large amount of funds in the afternoon, credit loosened again, and prices rebounded again. As a result, the National Bank injected as much as 301.9 billion on the same day, setting a new record for previous injections. From this, it can be seen that although the National Bank is doing its best to tighten credit, there are limitations due to the facts, and although it is doing its best to tighten, the effect is not always able to reach the ideal level. This point is especially worthy of attention, especially in the past year, when the authorities have almost taken tightening credit as the only means to stabilize prices. Among the general price indices last week, food, textiles, and building materials rose more. The appreciation of foreign exchange on Tuesday certainly had a great impact on import and export goods. However, whether export goods can recover from the exhaustion of the previous week due to the appreciation of foreign exchange this time is also quite problematic. The fact is probably not as simple as ideal, because the appreciation of foreign exchange also affects the domestic prices of export goods. As a result, the latter often offsets the impact of the appreciation and there is a surplus. This time is no exception to this common rule. In short, the economic machine is a whole, interconnected. It is absolutely impossible to cure a disease in a certain part by treating only a certain part. The wise financial authorities must already be aware of this, so we do not need to waste more words.</p>

<p>Currency and Finance: Credit Tightens, But Hot Money Reserves Remain Thick</p>
<p>Credit in this city tightened from the end of the previous week to last week. The authorities' active tightening of credit did have some effect, but this effect was very limited. For example, in terms of the surplus figures of the National Banks, the actual daily surplus of the banks last week (deducting the fixed deposits of commercial banks in the Central Bank) was as low as 60 billion on Thursday and 35 billion on Friday. At the weekend, it even reversed the norm, with a surplus of over 370 billion. Compared with the fact that the actual daily surplus of the banks was over 100 billion in the week before last (i.e., the last week of February), the actual surplus figures of the banks last week are truly far behind. However, credit in the last week showed a general tightening, while credit in the week before last was indeed excessively loose, which shows that in the late stage of inflation, the situation of currency flooding cannot be saved by tightening and other artificial forces. As for the reason why credit in this city tightened again last week, it was only the result of the relatively smaller size of the payment chips after the soaring of prices. The time for this kind of credit tightening will not only gradually shorten, but will inevitably lead to another larger credit situation.</p>
<p>The repeated high prices of commodities and the result of competition among various groups to purchase them have led to a shortage of orders in the market and an unprecedented demand for funds. As a result, the underground interest rate has also gradually risen. At the beginning of last week, the underground interest rate was fixed at 25%, but by Friday, it had already reached as high as 31.2%. As for securities arbitrage, it also reached as high as 27% on Thursday. Generally speaking, although those seeking funds are very eager, the source of funds has not been excessively scarce, and interbank lending is also quite flexible, which shows that the reserves of hot money in this city are very abundant. The fact that general commodities have not seen a sharp decline due to the tightening of credit in the past week is mainly due to this.</p>
<p>The surplus figures of foreign banks last week increased from Wednesday, with the average surplus amount from Wednesday to Friday being over several hundred billion, which is said to be related to the continued outflow of funds to the south.</p>
<p>The output of the indirect exchange group among commercial banks and firms decreased to more than 100 billion on Tuesday and Wednesday, but increased to 230 billion again on Thursday and Friday. As for the amount of cash used by banks and firms to settle and submit vouchers to the Central Bank, the daily average was around 560 billion, which shows the general tightness of credit.</p>
<p>Internal and External Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the exchange rates of internal exchange in this city to various places generally fell on Tuesday, but gradually rose after Wednesday, reaching new highs. For example, the exchange rate from this city to Guangzhou was only 120 yuan per thousand yuan on Tuesday, but it rose to 220 yuan on Friday, creating an unprecedented high price for the Guangzhou exchange rate. Similarly, the exchange rate to Xiamen was only 120 yuan on Wednesday and Thursday, but suddenly rose to 250 yuan on Friday, an increase of more than double. The exchange rates to Chongqing and Hankou also increased after Tuesday, but the rate of increase was not large. The fluctuations in the discount rate in Tianjin were not significant. The speed of exchange rate fluctuations can indicate the intensity of capital flight from this city to the south.</p>
<p>Last week, the benchmark rate for the foreign exchange market, the US dollar, was also raised again on Tuesday, from 149,000 yuan to 195,000 yuan, an increase of 30%. The pound also rose to 585,000 yuan. Last week, the Hong Kong dollar in Shanghai could be exchanged for 1.52 Hong Kong dollars per 100,000 yuan of legal tender on Monday, but it had shrunk to 1.17 Hong Kong dollars on Friday, a decrease of more than 20% within a week. The market price of the US dollar in Hong Kong was stable between 5.67 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>Last week, the fluctuations in the Chinese and foreign stock markets were quite drastic. The tightness of credit in the market could not resist the impact of the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate. Before Friday, the stocks generally rose. On Wednesday, the 14 types of Chinese stocks for the current period all reached the limit increase due to the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate and the unfavorable prospects for US loans. On Thursday, hot money continued to flock to the stock market, and 10 types of Chinese stocks for the current delivery again flew to reach the limit increase. On Friday, the market suddenly fell due to rumors of tighter credit and the hope of active US loans. However, from the end of the previous week to Friday of last week, the increase rate of Chinese stocks such as Yongsha was close to 20%. The trend of other stocks was also similar. As for foreign stocks, due to the repeated impact of the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate, they repeatedly reached new peaks. From the end of the previous week to Friday of last week, Yisha and Yisheng rose by about 30%, and British Federation rose by 20%, and Jardine Matheson rose by about 25%. Generally speaking, the increase was higher than that of Chinese stocks.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Dynamics</h3>
<p>(1) Production: The shortage of raw materials and equipment, the inflexibility of capital turnover, the daily increase in production costs, and the heavy burden of donations and taxes all constitute fatal threats to the current industrial sector. Sometimes, these threats exhibit some potentially diminishing postures due to public appeals, certain expressions of government authorities, or certain fantasies of the hopefuls themselves. However, almost as soon as they do, all kinds of rumors and wishes are shattered by ruthless facts.</p>
<p>Let's take an example: Last week, the Shanghai industrial sector unanimously supported and placed new hopes on the section regarding the Export Management Committee's opening of self-provided foreign exchange to purchase production equipment. However, according to relevant authorities, the section that depositing US dollar funds in the Central Bank would allow the purchase of production equipment in two months was not accurate. Thus, the question shifted to how to use foreign deposits to import production equipment and other supplementary equipment. This not only provides an outlet for Chinese monetary capitalists living abroad, but also encourages the current capital outflow to some extent. The various difficulties of the Shanghai industrial sector can be easily seen in the appeals and constructions of various industrial organizations. In the past week, the suggestions of the National Association of Industry on the 7th were expressed first, and the proposals of the board of directors of the Shanghai Industrial Association on the 8th were disclosed later. The former's suggestions were (1) Please the government to increase coal allocation to meet needs. (2) The prices of Japanese compensation machines should be reduced, and the application deadline should be extended. (3) The income tax should be levied at six times last year's rate, and should not be rigidly stipulated. (4) Exemption from special relief donations for industrial and commercial units should be requested. (5) All quota raw material allocations for the fifth and sixth quarters should be handed over to the industrial sector for self-distribution, etc. In addition to the suggestions, the National Industrial Association also sent representatives to Beijing to petition. However, whether the petition result can achieve its purpose is quite problematic. For example, regarding the opposition to the pre-collection of income tax at six times last year's rate, Dong Xianguang specifically issued a statement believing that the standard of six times is only a part of the tax payable. The actual situation will be checked in the future, and taxes will have to be made up except for those whose business has indeed suffered losses. If there are indeed losses, they will be refunded, and the government will pay interest. According to him, the income tax levied this year is the income of the previous year, so it is actually estimated at six times, not pre-collected, etc. This statement is like pouring cold water on the representatives who went to Beijing to petition and the majority of members waiting for good news in Shanghai. As for the general manufacturers who are only exempt from closing down, I am afraid there will be more feelings.</p>
<p>Speaking of the proposals of the Shanghai Industrial Association, its content can be divided into two points. One is aimed at the government, that is, advocating that the government increase the variety and quantity of workers' physical distribution and reduce the distribution price to avoid index increases. The second is to deal with workers, that is, requiring the authorities to rigidly stipulate that the calculation of wages must be based on the index of the month before the month of issuance. This kind of proposal of the Municipal Industrial Association does have its difficulties, but everyone knows that the faster the price increases, the farther their monetary income will be from their actual income. Therefore, wanting to calculate the actual salary issued in this month according to the cost of living index last month is probably not tolerable by the majority of people who live hand-to-mouth. Then all the requirements can only be directed at the government authorities, but can the authorities not reduce or even increase the physical distribution to employees? I am afraid it is another difficult problem that cannot be solved. In this year, even entrepreneurs engaged in production have been squeezed into the cracks and cannot be supported!</p>
<p>So many smart ancestral lines have had to turn to the south, and the idea of increasing profits has made people plan to build another paradise. In this time of turmoil and wind and rain in the Central Plains, the cry for factories to move south is clamoring everywhere. However, according to reports, after a certain industrial tycoon returned from inspecting South China, he had many feelings. The industrialist believed that the South was even more lacking in raw materials, and product sales were also very difficult. Moreover, according to the tycoon's analysis, industry needs mutual assistance, and a small number of industrial relocations are of no help. The conclusion is that the machine industry and various factories will no longer plan to relocate.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this difficult place and difficult season, all fantasies are inevitably shattered by ruthless objective facts.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign Exchange: The benchmark rate was adjusted again on Tuesday of last week. The US dollar was raised from 149,000 yuan to 195,000 yuan, which is still far behind the black market price of gold and silver, but in terms of the benchmark rate itself, it has increased by 30% again. It is said that the increase in foreign exchange can not only bring black market remittances into the right track, but also stimulate exports. However, after this adjustment of the market price of foreign exchange, the prices of general export goods, like previous increases in foreign exchange, have generally increased. For example, the production cost of sausage casings must be priced at 80 million yuan per barrel. However, foreign prices are falling day by day, and although foreign exchange has been raised again, the market price is still 25 million yuan, which is not enough to cover the huge cost. In addition, the market price of by-product light intestines has reached 80 million yuan, which is only enough to maintain production costs. In addition, duck feathers are between 6.5 million and 8 million yuan per sima dan, and Huzhou wool is 3 million yuan per dan, with very few Hakka people selling. In addition, the selling price of No. 17 local bristles has risen from 47 million to 52 million. According to this situation, although foreign exchange has been continuously raised, domestic and foreign prices have not been balanced. Obviously, engaging in exports at the current exchange rate and production cost is still unavoidable to lose money.</p>
<p>Whether foreign exchange can continue to be raised, and whether the market price after the increase can be close to the black market price to ensure that the black market price will no longer rise, are all problems. Therefore, a certain person in charge of the Export Promotion Office of the Export Management Committee once stated that in order to strengthen exports, in addition to adjusting the exchange rate, the purchase method will also be adopted at the same time. It is said that when the foreign exchange rate cannot promote the export of materials at a certain time and in a certain environment, the government will try to purchase them. Moreover, it is said that if exporters want to export on their own, the government will never force purchases. Otherwise, the government will purchase them and then have the exporters distribute them on their behalf. It is said that the purpose of this method is to assist exporters and promote export trade. However, in today's situation where the market price of foreign exchange can never keep up with the black market price, exporters are afraid that they have to gradually give their own export business to the control of the authorities in order to avoid losses when settling foreign exchange for exports. As for the exporters themselves, they have to become a technician who distributes on their behalf.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the proposed export material loan method, I am afraid that those who are truly benefited by the loan are still limited to the number of export products that the government can control. Therefore, the Import and Export Business Association expressed its opinions on improving the export material loan method last week: The main ones are (1) Export loans should not be limited to only a few items such as tung oil, Shantou yarn, raw silk, tea, bristles, and egg products, but should include general commodities. (2) Excess loans should be declared by the exporters themselves, and the quantity should be verified based on the number of foreign exchange that can be exported within a specified period. (3) Extend the total application period to six months. (4) Collateral can be guaranteed by bank credit, otherwise it can be mortgaged with commodity valuable securities or other real estate. (5) The interest rate should be handled according to the method of not exceeding 3% per month.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is obviously whether the conflict of interests between the official and the private sectors can be reconciled. For the income of foreign exchange, the authorities are only afraid of getting too little. Exporters naturally understand this point. Therefore, although the authorities of the Export Management Committee expressed their approval "in principle" to the above request, they still had to go to Beijing last week to make "technical" consultations with the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Offices for the loan opening issue!</p>

<h3>The Situation of the Match Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>There are currently twenty-five match factories in Shanghai, with a total of two hundred and twenty-six board-making machines, producing approximately 24,000 boxes per month, each box containing 7,200 small boxes. Among them, the Great China Match Factory is the largest, possessing one-fifth of all the board-making machines and its output accounts for one-fifth of the total. In addition to supplying the needs of this city, most of the products are transported and sold to North China and inland areas. Recently, due to the impact of the war, transportation has been obstructed, and sales have been poor. Furthermore, the main raw materials for manufacturing matches all rely on foreign imports. The sources and required quantities are listed below:</p>
<p>Sources and Required Quantities of Raw Materials</p>
<p>Name　Source　Quantity Required per Box　Quantity Required for a Monthly Production of 20,000 Boxes (in kilograms)</p>
<p>Potassium Chlorate　USA, Domestic　5.45　109,000</p>
<p>Paraffin Oil　USA　4.54　90,800</p>
<p>Rawhide Intestines　Domestic　48　3,000</p>
<p>Sulfur Flowers　USA　41　8,200</p>
<p>Red Phosphorus　USA　31　6,200</p>
<p>Rosin　USA　22　4,400</p>
<p>Potassium Dichromate　USA　14　2,800</p>
<p>Zinc Chloride　USA　14　2,800</p>
<p>Lampblack　USA, Domestic　08</p>
<p>Manganese Dichloride　Domestic　82</p>
<p>Trisulfide　This City　31</p>
<p>Amber　Singapore, Domestic　37</p>
<p>Fine Glass Powder　This City</p>
<p>Rose Red　USA</p>
<p>Chrome Yellow　Australia　7.8 kg</p>
<p>Phosphoric Acid　3.9 kg</p>
<p>Phosphoric Acid　Australia　3.9 kg</p>
<p>1,000 lbs Kraft Paper　USA　8 sheets　160,000 sheets</p>
<p>26 lbs Blue Paper　USA　89 sheets　1,780,000 sheets</p>
<p>55 lbs Red-Green Paper　USA　60 sheets　1,200,000 sheets</p>
<p>28 lbs Yellow Paper　USA　33 sheets　660,000 sheets</p>
<p>Cottonwood　USA, Qingdao　72 sq ft　1,400,000 sq ft</p>
<p>Planing Knives　France　120 pieces</p>
<p>Cutting Knives　France　120 pieces</p>
<p>Raw Sulfur　USA</p>
<p>Box Pieces　Domestic　7,000 pieces　144,000,000 sets</p>
<p>Trademark Paper　This City　7,200 pieces　144,000,000 sets</p>
<p>Since the implementation of import restrictions and allocations, the allocations have been decreasing each quarter, and the goods are becoming scarcer and more expensive, making sourcing even more difficult. Taking only potassium chlorate as an example, the current monthly demand, based on a production volume of 20,000 boxes, is 110,000 kilograms, with a current value of US$0.456 per kilogram, totaling approximately US$50,000. However, the current foreign exchange allocation per quarter is only US$150,000, which, in reality, is only enough to purchase this one raw material. The foreign exchange for other raw materials is then not available. In addition, the increasing cost of living and the increasing expenses further threaten the factories. Therefore, the current match industry has reached its most difficult stage, and it is not easy to maintain operations.</p>

<h3>The Source of Solar Energy</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shimin</p>
<p>The energy radiated by the sun into the external world every second is equal to the total energy that can be produced by five trillion atomic bombs. Scientists have been discussing this astonishing question for several centuries, trying to understand the source of that output energy.</p>
<p>The first relatively well-known scientific explanation was proposed about a hundred years ago. The explanation was based on the idea that the sun's energy is due to gravity, just like a stone falling to the earth requires energy. Because of the sun's enormous mass, it gradually contracts under its own gravitational pull, and gradually releases a large amount of energy.</p>
<p>If the energy radiated by the sun truly originated from gravity, then mathematical calculations would tell us that the energy would be exhausted within a period shorter than the Earth's lifespan! As for other mechanical explanations of "energy generation", they have also been proposed, but none of them can be expressed very well.</p>
<p>By 1930, the research of Sir A. Eddington and other astrophysicists in England proved that the sun is a mass of incandescent gas, with a core temperature of about 20 million degrees Celsius. At such high temperatures, not only are molecules broken down into atoms, but electrons are also stripped from the atoms. These atomic nuclei collide with each other at any time, causing nuclear changes. This is the source of the sun's energy.</p>
<p>The nuclear change from one type of atom to another has also been tested in the laboratory, and the energy released is a million times higher than ordinary chemical reactions. However, the efficiency of nuclear reactions produced in the laboratory is too low, and the result is often that the energy produced is less than the total amount of input. We know that only the high heat of the sun can provide sufficient opportunities to automatically maintain its own nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>In 1938, the German Hans Bethe made a detailed examination of known nuclear reactions, and came to the conclusion that the chain nuclear reaction of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen has good reason to be regarded as the source of solar energy generation. This chain reaction is called the Carbon Cycle. The carbon cycle can almost certainly be regarded as the source of energy for the sun and other stars.</p>
<p>What is the carbon cycle? Obviously, the carbon cycle is not just a single nuclear reaction, but a set of reactions that occur sequentially, starting with a hydrogen nucleus, which is a proton, and an atomic nucleus with an atomic weight of twelve, called carbon-12. The proton collides with the carbon-12 atomic nucleus, breaking through the electrical repulsion it encounters and being absorbed into a radioactive nitrogen-13 atomic nucleus. The nitrogen-13 atomic nucleus automatically emits a positron with a positive charge, and then transforms into carbon-13.</p>
<p>In the hot gas inside the sun, carbon, after a short moment of nuclear orbiting, acquires another proton and becomes a stable nitrogen-14 atomic nucleus. This nitrogen nucleus will continue to move until it acquires another proton to form a radioactive oxygen-15 atomic nucleus. Then another Positron Disintegration appears, generating a nitrogen isotope with an atomic weight of fifteen. After some time of movement, the final reaction occurs, but the atomic nucleus reaction at this moment is no longer a simple reception, but the final atomic nucleus splits into two, one is the carbon-12 atomic nucleus, and the other is the ordinary helium atomic nucleus, with an atomic weight of four.</p>
<p>In summary, after six reactions, only the changes of four protons and three positrons produce stable helium atomic nuclei, but this production method releases a staggering amount of atomic energy. The energy released by one pound of hydrogen in this way is more than ten times greater than the maximum efficiency of energy released by one pound of uranium in an atomic bomb. In fact, the storage of this energy is indeed very large. If our sun emits radiant energy at its current rate, it can last for at least five hundred trillion years without feeling a lack of fuel.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the carbon is re-reduced without any loss in the carbon cycle. Although carbon is a relatively abundant element, it is not as abundant as nitrogen. Therefore, if carbon is consumed, the fuel supply may be exhausted within a certain period of time, perhaps fifty million years, while nitrogen can maintain the future life of the sun for five hundred trillion years under these circumstances!</p>
<p>In the laboratory, all nuclear reactions in the carbon cycle have been observed and measured. The atomic energy released by the Swlf-regenerative Cerbon Cycle does indeed conform to the solar radiation energy determined in the observation. Moreover, no other atomic nucleus reaction is so close to the energy numbers radiated by the sun at a high temperature of 20 million degrees Celsius, which can serve as a powerful basis for confirming the accuracy of this "theory."</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out the similarities and differences between the nuclear reactions that exist in the sun and the reactions that occur in atomic bombs. One or two of them store a large amount of energy in the atomic nucleus, and once the reaction starts, it promotes continued progress with its own power. But the similarities are limited to this. Later, carbon atomic nuclei are regenerated in the sun, while uranium atomic nuclei are permanently eroded in atomic bombs. The carbon cycle contains all light atomic nuclei, and the release of energy is when the lightest atomic nucleus—the proton—creates a larger helium atomic nucleus. Atomic bombs, on the other hand, contain the heaviest atomic nuclei—uranium and protactinium, and the release of energy is when they disintegrate into two almost equal parts.</p>
<p>Finally, the most important difference is that the carbon cycle occurs between protons and other atomic nuclei that carry a charge, while atomic bombs are reactions between neutrons and other atomic nuclei that do not carry a charge. This is the point that explains why on Earth, we can only use atomic nucleus fission, and not a set of atomic nucleus reactions like the carbon cycle, to produce a practical amount of atomic energy. Because uncharged neutrons can penetrate uranium and protactinium atomic shuttles at room temperature, while the carbon cycle requires extremely high temperatures, and at high temperatures, protons must also be endowed with high speeds in order to effectively overcome the electrical repulsion possessed by carbon and nitrogen to achieve the purpose of combination.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we can assert that we need high speed for protons in the circulating system in order to use it to start the carbon cycle. The main difference lies in this. All protons in the sun are endowed with high speeds, while only a very small amount can be produced in the laboratory. At the same time, when protons pass through matter, its degree is sharply reduced. The atomic nuclei in the sun always maintain a certain speed, so the reactions between carbon nuclei and nitrogen nuclei can proceed indefinitely and maintain themselves. This is also cyclic. The energy released by the carbon cycle generates high temperatures, and the thermal energy of this high temperature also allows the carbon cycle to continue.</p>
<p>Can we generate the same high temperatures on Earth as in the sun? This is a new question. Finally, I will answer you like this.</p>
<p>It can be said that this is possible with atomic bombs, but even if we can generate this high temperature, we cannot maintain it, because the heat will immediately dissipate in the form of various bond radiation energies. The large amount of matter surrounding the center of the sun can prevent radiation from escaping quickly. There are many situations on Earth that we cannot imitate, so it can almost be said with certainty that we will never be able to maintain a nuclear reaction like the sun.</p>

<h3>Physics for Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Wang Qiande</p>
<p>An Introduction to a Good Book</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in physics textbooks, the descriptions of phenomena or laws are all serious. A set of modified words is used, and a phenomenon or law is explained quite seriously. Then, like traditionalists, an example is given. The law then comes to an end – that is still a relatively well-compiled textbook – or even some textbooks are hard to find even one example. As a result, after reading the entire physics book, or memorizing all the laws, formulas, and principles of physics, you still get nothing. This situation is the most pitiful and the most terrible.</p>
<p>Physics for Entertainment can be said to be a booklet specially for giving examples in physics. Moreover, some examples are rarely encountered in any physics books, so it is a supplementary textbook for physics. Although it does not explain the laws of physics clearly, after some simple or novel examples, those laws of physics are clearly displayed in your mind, and there is no ambiguity at all. Besides, the words in this book are very lighthearted, making people feel no trouble and burden when reading it.</p>
<p>Physics for Entertainment is divided into ten chapters. Each chapter talks about examples with completely different natures. Its order is also arranged similarly to ordinary physics. The first chapter is "Speed," followed by "Gravity and Pressure," "Basic Laws of Mechanics," "Environmental Resistance," and the last chapter talks about "Magnetism and Electricity." Which part of the wheel moves faster?</p>
<p>Almost everyone has seen the fact that wheels rotate, but perhaps only a few people have noticed, or even no such idle people, standing by the roadside all day long, gazing at the wheels of passing cars, to notice a novel thing, that is, "The upper part of the wheel moves faster than the lower part. If you look at the wheel spokes (or bicycle spokes) of any carriage (or bicycle) when it is speeding, you can also see that the upper wheel spokes are mixed together, while the lower part can still be seen as separated. The situation that the upper part of the wheel moves faster than the lower part still occurs." After such a description in the book, there are also some small experiments and proofs.</p>
<p>A Question That Is Not a Joke</p>
<p>When a speeding train runs past in front of you, you will feel dizzy or uncomfortable, but have you ever noticed the wheels of this speeding train? "In a speeding train, there are also wheels that do not move forward but backward. Indeed, this action is only in a very small fraction of a second. However, the fact that this speeding train moves backward does exist, no matter how contrary it is to our daily perception" — Physics for Entertainment says this, and there are also three illustrations used to prove that this fact is accurate.</p>
<p>Walking and Running</p>
<p>Chinese people often feel "unintelligible" about what they do. This feeling of "unintelligible" is a disease caused by the low level of academic education. To cure this epidemic is not an easy task. It is excusable that we feel we do not know why for complex and profound things, but "walking and running" are closest to you, and you should not not understand their truth. In Physics for Entertainment, there are two pictures and some words, which give a detailed description of these two ordinary actions.</p>
<p>Should You Jump Forward When Getting Out of a Car?</p>
<p>People who grow up in cities must have seen the phenomenon of "jumping off a car." Before the car has stopped, some experienced people can get on and off freely, just like when the car stops. Honestly speaking, as long as you can hold on to the support on the car when jumping on, it is foolproof, and there is no danger that can arise. However, getting off the car can cause great danger, so it must be done by experienced people and jump backward. "Never jump towards the front of the vehicle's movement, because the speed given to our body by inertia when jumping backward can be eliminated, so that when our body lands, there is no danger of strong tilting."</p>
<p>Where Will an Object Be Heavier?</p>
<p>The weight of an object is produced by the earth's gravitational pull; but the question "Where will an object be heavier?" seems a bit novel. Indeed, this is a question that ordinary people have not imagined, but Physics for Entertainment tells us: "Objects are heavier near the ground. As an object goes deeper into the earth, its weight also decreases. If it reaches the center of the earth, the weight will disappear completely. Moreover, when an object is slightly higher off the ground, its amount will also decrease."</p>
<p>Perpetual Motion Machine</p>
<p>Although this is somewhat close to fantasy, it is also a text worth reading.</p>
<p>Others, like "Where Does the Gunfire Come From?" "How Much Is a Lightning Bolt Worth?" "Can Archimedes Lift the Earth?" "Is It Faster in the Day or Faster at Night?" "Non-Stop Train," are all excellent articles.</p>
<p>In short, for friends who hate physics, after reading Physics for Entertainment, they will naturally feel interesting. Friends who love physics will gain more valuable knowledge after reading it.

<h3>The Gaoshan People of Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— H.K. Zhou</p>
<p>Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan not only has scenery and power, but also a treasure trove of anthropology – the Gaoshan people.</p>
<p>There are a total of eight types of Gaoshan people in Taiwan, including primitive ethnic groups with dark skin, facial tattoos, and shell bead clothing. In the past, the Japanese called them "savages," but now they are called Gaoshan people. Each ethnic group does not speak the same language, and they have no writing system. However, the Gaoshan people by Sun Moon Lake have been Sinicized and, on the surface, are almost the same as ordinary rural folks. However, their lives are simple, so you can still see traces of their primitive existence everywhere.</p>
<p>They only arrived at Sun Moon Lake 273 years ago, settled on the east side of the lake, and lived by farming and hunting. The entire ethnic group has more than 4,000 people, ruled by one chieftain and two squad leaders. In the past, they had to train in arms. When they fought with other tribes, the entire ethnic group would turn out, and everyone was a fighter. Their weapons included spears, short knives, bows, and arrows. The chieftain was the most prestigious and most skilled in martial arts in the entire tribe.</p>
<p>Their sources of livelihood include agriculture, fishing, and hunting. They eat by putting food in bowls and grabbing it with their hands. During the farming season, men and women work from sunrise to sunset. Men take care of the fields, and women take care of household affairs, weaving, and papermaking. Their houses are very simple, all made of firewood. Some also make mud walls. Their means of water transportation are still primitive dugout canoes. When they are free from farming, they go hunting and fishing.</p>
<p>They also have a God, their own God, whom every family must worship.</p>
<p>They have no calendar and rely entirely on celestial phenomena to predict the time. Therefore, the time for the New Year is not the end of our lunar year but our Mid-Autumn Festival in August. The New Year is the most important festival of the year for them and also their happiest time. They celebrate the New Year for half a month, from the Mid-Autumn Festival in August to the end of August. During this half-month, they only drink, sing, and dance all day long, and they do not care about anything else. They also make their own wine and love to drink very much. When drinking, they use large bowls. If they have a good capacity for wine, they invite guests to drink with large bowls, and guests must drink it all in one gulp. It is impolite not to finish it, so tourists who cannot hold their liquor dare not go there during their New Year. Their best friends drink a bowl of wine together. They also love to smoke, and they are very addicted to it. The pipe is made of bamboo tubes.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Gaoshan people's singing and dancing, it can arouse our interest: When singing, men and women gather in a square. Each woman takes a wooden stick that is thick at both ends and thin in the middle, called a "pestle." The long ones are seven or eight feet long, and the short ones are four or five feet long. Children take the short ones. Everyone gathers around a flat stone and constantly knocks the wooden sticks on the stone, which can emit a kind of different thicknesses of drumming sounds. Women who do not hold wooden sticks squat beside them, each holding a bamboo tube and only knocking on the ground, which can emit another thicker drumming sound. Such a collective drumming is very rhythmic and sounds very complex. After drumming for a while, they begin to sing. Everyone's voice is different in pitch, but they are very harmonious. According to what I heard, it is at least a two-part female chorus. After singing, everyone puts down the wooden sticks, holds hands, and forms a circle, and then starts dancing. Their hands have no movements, only the jumping of their feet. It can probably be divided into four kinds of steps. Sometimes they jump in circles, sometimes they shrink the circle, and sometimes they enlarge it. The movements are neat and natural. Later, they even jump and sing. After singing for a while, they rest, which is considered the end of a section.</p>
<p>The appearance and color of their clothes are very bright and eye-catching, and there are sometimes distinctions between seasons and classes. The material of the clothes is already cotton fabric (most of which are now bought from outside). Some of the men's coats are made of animal skin, and they also wrap a piece of skin on their heads as a hat. Men and women all have bare feet and have not yet invented shoes (some of the shoes now are introduced from the outside). We can still see many primitive qualities from their decorations and clothes, but now they are no longer what they used to be. Almost all of them are wearing Han clothing.</p>
<p>What interests tourists most now is a pair of princesses of the Gaoshan people, especially the Second Princess, who is beautiful and lively, only in her twenties. In addition to speaking their native language, she can also speak Japanese and not very fluent Mandarin. Every tourist can become her honorary son-in-law there. For a hundred dollars (Taiwan currency), she can take a photo with you as a souvenir. Now, these two princesses are completely unlike the Gaoshan people. When guests come, they dress up and take photos with the guests. After the photos are taken, they take off their native clothes, put on Han clothing, and also have their hair permed and wear high-heeled leather shoes. They look like a modern lady. Her income from taking photos every day averages two or three thousand Taiwan dollars, so it is obvious that she has transformed from the ruling class into the bourgeoisie!</p>
<p>The life of the Gaoshan people is still more difficult than that of ordinary people. They usually eat coarse vegetables and brown rice, or even porridge. They only eat a little rice noodles during the New Year, which shows how difficult their lives are. The main reasons are, of course, the low level of production and the backwardness of culture. In the past, they were a large tribe of more than 4,000 people, but later, because of the difficult living conditions, they moved out. Now, there are only more than 200 people left. There are a total of more than 140,000 Gaoshan people in Taiwan. Those who hide in the mountains still live their primitive lives, and those who have contact with the outside world are gradually assimilated. They can speak Taiwanese, wear Han clothing, and engage in agriculture as a profession, and their lives are relatively prosperous. Schools have also been widely established within their areas to educate them. They are all new citizens of the country. I hope that the country will send more ethnologists to their place to investigate so as to improve their lives.</p>
<h3>The Eve of 317: The Vigilance We Should Have</h3>
<p>— Ding Jiwan</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow is the National Doctors' Day that deserves our vigilance. Looking back on the past, the enthusiastic situation of the National Doctors' community striving for status and petitioning is still vivid in our minds. However, in recent years, with the successive internal and external troubles, the entire society has fallen into an abnormal state. National doctors and national medicine have also escaped this example with difficulty. Worries and hardships do not allow us to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Every year when 317 comes, we inevitably commemorate it, but we must not ignore the true meaning of the commemoration. Every year when we commemorate, we reflect on whether we have made significant progress and great achievements. Given that the future of national medicine is facing numerous thorns, we must not be discouraged. As long as we are willing to work hard and eliminate the current difficulties, the only goal should be how to promote the unique essence of Eastern medicine and develop its bright future. This is what Jiwan sincerely hopes for. 3/15</p>
<h3>Prolonged Menstruation and Metrorrhagia</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhongli</p>
<p>Curettage as a Cause</p>
<p>Prolonged menstruation refers to continuous and unceasing menstrual bleeding, dripping and unclean, occurring in small amounts. Metrorrhagia refers to a sudden and profuse menstrual flow, like a tidal wave breaking through a dam, but also caused by overexertion and internal injury, leading to sudden congestion. It is not uncommon to see cases where prolonged menstruation initially occurs, followed by metrorrhagia. Western medicine pathology often attributes it to uterine congestion, initially caused by inflammation of the uterine lining. Western medicine, to prevent its spread, sometimes performs curettage. According to patients' accounts, after multiple curettage procedures, profuse or continuous bleeding often occurs, or after the bleeding stops, it suddenly returns uncontrollably after a period of time. Even hemostatic agents are ineffective. This is likely related to the weakened uterine lining caused by curettage, which makes it prone to bleeding. If it is a case of chronic endometritis, simple anti-inflammatory vaginal washes should suffice. Curettage is more harmful than beneficial. It is like prescribing dispersing and invigorating remedies when traditional Chinese medicine calls for tonifying and astringing agents. A disconnect in diagnosis leads to ineffective treatment. The different treatments for these conditions are outlined below for the reader's reference.</p>
<p>"Prolonged Menstruation" can occur before or after menstruation, recurring every few days, with dark-colored blood containing small clots, or pale red blood, accompanied by leucorrhea. It can also be caused by emotional upset and anger during menstruation, affecting the liver Qi, manifested as abdominal distension, headache, and constipation. These conditions are all related to imbalance of the Chong meridian (ovarian inflammation), but the medication used varies depending on whether the condition is deficient or excessive. For excessive conditions, blood-activating and Qi-regulating herbs, supplemented with heat-clearing agents, are appropriate. For deficient conditions, blood-tonifying and astringent herbs are necessary, along with attention to rest.</p>
<p>"Metrorrhagia" is not always due to deficiency and blood loss. Deficient and excessive patterns must be differentiated. Deficient patterns are often due to the inability of the Chong and Ren meridians to control the blood, manifested as aversion to cold, pale complexion, palpitations, and lower back pain. Treatment should focus on Qi-tonifying and blood-astringing methods. If there is also liver Yang rising, manifested as a pale complexion with red lips, flushed cheeks, and a red tongue, then Yin-nourishing and heat-clearing herbs should be added. Excessive patterns often involve internal obstruction due to retained blood stasis, preventing new blood from returning to the meridians. Treatment should focus on hemostatic and blood-activating methods. The use of appropriate medication based on the condition is invariably effective.</p>
<h3>Scrofula and Carbuncles</h3>
<p>— Zhu Renkang</p>
<p>What Are the Differences? How Are They Treated?</p>
<p>Scrofula and carbuncles are both external diseases, but their onset speed and symptoms are different. The severity and difficulty of treatment also vary. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>First, let's discuss "carbuncles." They develop quickly, with redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Early treatment with external plasters and internal heat-clearing and swelling-reducing medications can often lead to resolution. In more severe cases, the skin becomes tense and pus forms in about a week. Surgical incision and drainage should be performed immediately. After the pus is drained, the swelling subsides, the pain stops, and the fever subsides. The wound heals and closes quickly.</p>
<p>This type of carbuncle is more common, such as "cervical carbuncles" in the neck, "arm carbuncles" in the arms, and "leg carbuncles" in the legs. They are all easily treated. "Scrofula," on the other hand, is very different. It develops very slowly, starting as a very small, hard nodule under the skin. There is no redness or pain. Because the onset is not acute, it is often ignored and left untreated. Over time, it gradually enlarges and, when it ruptures, it does not discharge pus, but a thin, yellowish fluid mixed with caseous material. The wound is depressed and, if not treated properly, it takes a long time to heal. Examples include "scrofula" in the neck and "wandering phlegm" (commonly known as "scrofulous abscesses") that can occur throughout the body. These are all surgical tuberculosis conditions. Patients are often weak and require the patient treatment of an experienced doctor, with attention to nutritional support, to achieve a cure.</p>
<p>There are also milder cases of phlegm nodules, such as "wind phlegm" and "monkey phlegm" that occur in the neck. The initial symptoms are similar to scrofula, but they start with pain and easily suppurate if not dispersed. They are also easily treated.</p>

<h3>Stroke and Hypertension</h3>
<p>— Xu Yiqian</p>
<p>At this time of spring awakening, the number of stroke patients is noticeably increasing. This is because liver Yang rises in the spring, and for those with kidney Yin deficiency, the deficient Yang disturbs the upper part of the body, causing the brain to lose its master, which is what Western medicine calls hypertension. Pathologically, it is actually caused by arteriosclerosis. This condition occurs suddenly, and those over the age of fifty, with declining vitality, often regard it as a warning sign.</p>
<p>The incidence of stroke is no less in Western countries than in China. Iodides, calcium, ice packs, and bloodletting are commonly used for treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine often uses seaweed, kelp, arisaema, calamus, antelope horn, and rhinoceros horn, with significant success. For prevention, attention should be paid to daily care. Rejuvenation pills are often taken. The author has used Return to Heaven Rejuvenation Pills with even more certain effect. Among the main ingredients are rhinoceros horn, which strengthens the heart and stops bleeding, and is especially suitable for emergency treatment of those who have already suffered a stroke (these pills are available at Hong Ji Tang in Ti Lan Qiao).</p>

<h3>Contentment Within</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Pessimism and hedonism are two extreme views of life, but neither can be said to be a sound philosophy. Here, we will discuss hedonism.</p>
<p>The purpose of hedonism is undoubtedly to pursue happiness and joy, so it is sometimes called optimism. Those who embrace the "drink today, for tomorrow we die" attitude also consider themselves optimists. However, true optimists and hedonists are different. True optimists must have the ability to accept adversity and adapt to circumstances. They do not seek happiness and joy at all costs. Although optimists do not crave progress, their view of life is closer to nature.</p>
<p>Hedonism, which seeks only pleasure and happiness, is different. This type of person believes that happiness can be "found" and happiness can be pursued. At its worst, they even think that "joining the crowd" and "seeking thrills" are ways to find pleasure. For example, when going to the movies, many people try every means to get a ticket, even if it means struggling to get one. As for whether the film is worth the effort, they don't even bother to ask. Drinking must be done to the point of intoxication, and gambling must continue all night long in order to be stimulating and pleasurable.</p>
<p>But a true optimist would never do that. The basic attitude of an optimist is to do things when the mood strikes and to be content with what comes. They would never join the crowd to watch a movie, they would never argue with others about drinking, and even gambling, the most stimulating of activities, would have its limits. They don't engage in worrying thoughts, but they are not so foolish as to be unable to distinguish right from wrong. Their so-called optimism is simply the natural philosophy encompassed by the four words "contentment within."</p>
<p>Recently, I saw these words in the filler column of a Western magazine: "Happiness cannot be pursued, but only understood and inspired." It also says: "In pursuing a distorted utopia, people often overlook the simple beauty and happiness in life. In pursuing the fleeting rainbow of material things, we lose the opportunity to appreciate the splendor of the spirit." These words truly express the attitude towards life held by a true optimist.</p>
<p>The meaning of joy and happiness originally has a greater spiritual component than a material one. A person who is hungry, cold, or suffering from illness cannot be said to have any happiness or joy, but it can be asserted that happiness and joy cannot be obtained solely through material life. Although the poor generally suffer, the rich are not necessarily happy. This is not an "Ah Q" mentality. A universally prosperous society naturally contributes greatly to human happiness and joyful living. For example, if society is prosperous, everyone is well-dressed and well-fed, and everything is pleasing to the eye, then everyone will naturally be happy and reduce many external responses of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. But even if there were such a paradise on earth, individuals would not necessarily react in the same way.</p>
<p>Because happiness and joy have no definite boundaries, and although material life has some influence on them, it is not a decisive influence. The decisive influence is a person's spiritual perspective, which is each individual's attitude towards life. The natural world has no such thing as happiness or unhappiness, we don't need to "pursue" them at all. The feeling of happiness depends entirely on the degree of connection between our hearts and the natural world. Happiness gained by force is only a fleeting stimulus.</p>
<p>To conclude this article, I will quote a few words from Thomas Edison, which were also quoted in the filler column: "We only know one ten-thousandth of anything in the world." Therefore, we should open our minds to all beautiful things, let our hearts absorb life as much as possible, and extend our hands, which have only been in contact with filth, to the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>But I must add one sentence: Everything must be free of artificiality. Because only those who can experience "contentment within" in the natural world can obtain true joy and true happiness.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Insurance</h3>
<p>— Chao Ran</p>
<p>Insurance companies are springing up everywhere nowadays, and their businesses are diverse and varied. However, the strangest insurance deal is probably one done with insurance companies in England and France.</p>
<p>In 1925, King Prajadhipok of Siam ascended the throne. Seeing the unstable political situation, he took out a large "unemployment insurance" policy with British and French insurance companies. Sure enough, he was forced to abdicate in 1935, and relied on this settlement to enjoy the rest of his years until his death in 1941. According to insurance industry sources, King Prajadhipok is the only head of state in history to insure himself against abdication.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the World</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State of the United States, had a total of only five staff members in the Department of State during his tenure, but at that time the Department of State only had to deal with four foreign countries. Now, under the leadership of Marshall, the total number of employees in the Department of State has reached 18,500, but the number of countries that have diplomatic relations with the United States has also increased to 61.</p>
<p>After World War II, more than 58% of the U.S. troops stationed in Germany were under the age of twenty.</p>
<h3>Whispers Before the Orchid</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>Returning from the city, my wife and children were out. The curtains were quiet, but filled with the faint fragrance of a few pots of orchids. Outside the window, the faint sunlight was gradually setting in the west, and the pigeons were still strolling leisurely, and I suddenly felt that I had stolen a moment of peace in the bustling world.</p>
<p>Suddenly I remembered that the word "orchid" is often seen in Western literature. For example, in Wilde's plays, whenever he describes a boudoir, he often mentions casually, "There are beautiful orchids on the table"; sometimes, he simply says: "Boudoir, orchids, perfume." As if the reader should be responsible for other imaginings. In Wilde's dreams, orchids add nobility, warmth, and a faint fragrance to the ivory palace.</p>
<p>I gently stroked the dark green, graceful leaves, and thought of a painter who called himself "the laziest man in the world." He painted orchids with the brush of Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi, with caution in his ease, famous for his elegance and beauty. But what about the orchids that my hand is now stroking? How do they compare to those exquisitely framed paintings? Those countless leaves may not be beautiful, but they are far from the perfect and natural composition of the paintings. I couldn't help but move the pot to a different position. No, I couldn't place it to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>To place it in the most appropriate way, I would probably have to use scissors? But why! On second thought, some say that Zhong Yao's and Wang Xizhi's calligraphy ultimately fell short, precisely because they had a bit of "scissors skills" in mind before they put their pens down? I couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>I also laugh at myself. People with money buy this and that, and they always listen for news when they have time - or listen to rumors if there is no news, and then rush to buy this and that. Everyone jumps into the car and wishes they could get to the market immediately to make a deal. They talk business all day long, talk business while eating, and talk business on the phone even when they get home at night. Tomorrow, they jump out of bed and rush to the market again, it's business, business, business. And I'm still wandering in front of the orchids, thinking of Wilde and Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi, isn't that absurd!</p>
<p>So, I happily poured wine and punished myself with a large goblet.</p>
<h3>Happy Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (98)</p>
<p>As Qi Wan spoke, she patted the edge of the bed and said, "Please sit down!" Dao Yun did not sit down, but squatted in front of the bed and said, "I said, please don't be offended, Miss Gu, I... I... I hope to cooperate thoroughly with Miss Gu." Qi Wan said: "Of course, cooperation must be thorough, how can you only do half of it and then stop." Dao Yun said: "That's not what I mean, I mean to cooperate for life, I'm being presumptuous to say this, but I do have this hope, because a career must have two people who are like-minded and have shared interests in order to do it thoroughly." Qi Wan said: "That's for sure." Dao Yun said: "I'm in the film industry, Miss Gu is in the Peking Opera industry, we don't get angry, we both have considerable experience. We will definitely have considerable results when we cooperate, that's for sure." Qi Wan said: "Yes, that's what I think too." Dao Yun said: "I... I have another extravagant wish, since I saw Miss Gu, I've had a deep impression in my mind, now fate brings us together and we meet in the hospital, and we get along well, we are very compatible, I would like to form a couple with each other, it will be of great hope for our future careers." As he spoke, he was squatting in front of the bed, and after saying that sentence, he knelt straight in front of the bed to propose marriage. Qi Wan, seeing that he was coming too suddenly, hurriedly said: "Get up! If the nurses see it, wouldn't they laugh!" Dao Yun said: "No! Miss Gu! Promise me!" Qi Wan said: "Get up first, let me consider it!" Dao Yun stood up. Qi Wan said: "Please go out first, let me think carefully." Dao Yun, seeing that Qi Wan was asking him to leave, was afraid that this matter would become deadlocked again, and said, "Can I come back in half an hour?" Qi Wan nodded with a smile. Dao Yun said: "This matter is related to my life's fortune, I hope Miss Gu won't disappoint me!" Qi Wan still nodded with a smile, watched Dao Yun leave, lay on the pillow, and sighed slightly. Her mind, after this stimulation, was very chaotic. She calmed herself down and thought carefully. She and Zhu Zhai could not be reunited, and Dao Yun's appearance was no less than Zhu Zhai's. His future seemed to have more development than Zhu Zhai's. She could not gain a foothold in Beiping, and going to the south would give her a mental comfort. Now that she had this opportunity, she should not miss it. When Qi Wan thought of this, she felt that there was only the reason to agree, and no reason to refuse.</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>— Man Ru</p>
<p>Someone said: "Silence is golden." But can the value of silence be compared to gold? The value of gold is not fixed, it is limited. Silence is forever priceless.</p>
<p>When you face a great building, or a magnificent landscape, you are silent. Because you feel that all verbal praise is superfluous, enough to destroy your appreciation. Only in silence can you fully appreciate this greatness or magnificence in detail and with endless aftertaste.</p>
<p>When you suddenly meet a friend you have been dreaming of for many years, you can't speak - you are silent. Don't you have many things to tell him? So much to say to him? Suddenly meeting is such a rare opportunity. However, you are silent. Because you feel that your emotions at this time cannot be expressed in words. Everything you say is bound to be far from what you want to express. So, you are silent. Will the other person think your silence is abrupt and inhumane? No, definitely not. Because he can't speak either, he is also silent. Silence is better than words!</p>
<p>When you are discriminated against by the world and feel the coldness of human feelings and unhappiness, will you go around looking for people to talk to? Will you eliminate your unhappiness by venting? No, this is useless, and sometimes dangerous. You must be silent. Only in silence can you think carefully, discover your own mistakes, forgive the badness of others, rekindle your confidence in the world, and increase your enjoyment of life. This is the right and healthy thing to do. Only in silence can you get it.</p>
<p>Silence can increase a person's interest in life and cultivate a person's temperament. Its value is indeed infinite, and cannot be expressed in words. Maybe I have said too much. I only hope that my words will not reduce your estimate of the value of silence. Let us carefully savor the value of silence in silence.</p>

<p>The moon sets on Penglai, a great river's chill.</p>
<p>Though strangely impoverished, poems I embrace,</p>
<p>Though old, I still boast a clear vision's trace,</p>
<p>Accustomed to foreign lands' bleak stay,</p>
<p>We see all kinds of monsters, sending life away.</p>

<h3>The Art of Advertising</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>Mr. Hardman of Connecticut owned a farm. He wanted to sell a portion of the farm's assets, so he placed an advertisement in the classified section of the New York Times for three consecutive Sundays, but there was very little response, which disappointed him greatly.</p>
<p>Hardman decided to study his advertisement from the perspective of an advertiser. After analysis, he found that the psychological aspect of attracting customers' attention when selling agricultural products had not been achieved. So he decided to rewrite the advertisement and reverse the focus.</p>
<p>It turned out that the farm's neighbor was a famous movie star, whom we will call Joe Blanc's villa for the sake of this story. Hardman understood the value of the farm's location, but he couldn't think of a proper way to promote it, both to take advantage of the fame of the big star and to avoid being sued by Mr. Blanc.</p>
<p>Later, he came up with a subtle advertising narrative. He began by describing the farm, and then gave people who were interested in the farm a way to identify the location:</p>
<p>"After getting off the train, take bus number 16 and get off at Jones Road. Then you can inquire about the location of Joe Blanc's villa - the farm is next door to the villa."</p>
<p>As soon as the advertisement was published, it received twenty-eight inquiries and was sold within three days.</p>

<h3>On Prohibiting Dancing</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yizhi</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Strange things happen every year, but this year there are more than ever." Who would have thought that frail dancers would engage in brawls and storm the government office, leaving the dignified Social Affairs Bureau in disarray? Isn't this a strange phenomenon?</p>
<p>However, this is a social problem concerning the lifeline of more than 200,000 workers in Shanghai. Driven by survival fears, they acted rashly and resorted to this desperate measure, which has its reasons.</p>
<p>Although this issue has been raised for discussion in the recent City Council meeting and a resolution has been passed, it has not been finally resolved, and its future development is still worth noting. I think the government's reasons for prohibiting dancing are nothing more than the following: (1) Some senior government officials, due to subjective views, dislike dancing, so they use their administrative authority to implement the ban. (2) The Savings Movement Committee of the Executive Yuan suggested that the government ban all commercial dance halls nationwide during the period of suppressing the rebellion, hence the resolution of the Executive Yuan. (3) Perhaps due to the remarks of one or two foreigners criticizing that China is fighting at the front and dancing at the rear, the government took steps to ban dancing based on this.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, we believe that the government should absolutely not handle a complex matter concerning the lives of the people based on the personal preferences of a few officials. A country claiming to be ruled by law should not do so. Regarding the second point, in terms of saving, we believe that the country has reached such a state of poverty and exhaustion that there are too many things that should be saved. For example, state-owned institutions, because they have money in hand, tend to spend it arbitrarily. If we really want to save, there are too many things that can be saved, too many to list. Saving by targeting dancing as the first priority, thus causing serious problems in the lives of tens of thousands of people, feels almost cruel. Regarding the third point, the words of one or two foreigners are a symbolic representation of China's current situation, and do not necessarily mean that dancing should be prohibited. We cannot take them out of context. Moreover, since the ban on dancing in Shanghai became a big uproar, foreigners have been confused. They don't understand why China wants to ban dancing. This proves that our previous reasoning is correct.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeshi, in his short article "My Opinion on the Ban on Dancing" in "Free Talk," prioritizes saving gasoline and suggests that the mayor should stop using cars for a week, and all agencies should stop using stoves or heating for two weeks. This is true saving and greatly benefits the country, because these things are used less and less, and cannot be reused after being used. The money in people's pockets is different. When dance patrons use it, dancers and dance hall staff get it. The total amount will not be short by a penny. Even though they trade and return, each gets what they need, and it does not harm the country at all. We think these words are also very pertinent.</p>
<p>All dance halls are licensed by the government and pay taxes in the same way as other businesses. Therefore, the status of dance halls is the same as that of hotels, restaurants, theaters, and cinemas. That is to say, the existence of dance halls is legal. To take a step back, even in terms of things harmful to society, dancing cannot be ranked first. Comparing dancing with things like prostitution and gambling, which is more harmful? According to the current Criminal Law, gambling, theft, opium, fraud, intimidation, etc., are all crimes, and dancing has never been included in criminal behavior. Even if the government is really determined to ban dancing, the most legitimate step should be to first ask the Legislative Yuan to pass a separate law banning dancing, or to include "dancing is a crime" in the Criminal Law. Then there will be a strong legal basis. Unfortunately, the government does not do this. With a simple order from the Executive Yuan, it deprives tens of thousands of people of their right to survival, which is quite regrettable.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dance Hall Industry Association, some time ago, requested the government to withdraw the ban on dancing based on the Constitution. We deeply sympathize with them. All modern intellectuals should support justice and leave a way for people who make a living by dancing to survive.</p>
<p>Under the current economic situation, the result of banning dancing will inevitably force good women into prostitution, and dancers will only have one way out: to become prostitutes. Is adding this large group of prostitutes to society an evolution of society? Furthermore, regarding dancers themselves and dance industry workers, we have not heard the government give them any clear instructions and methods for changing careers. If they only use empty rhetoric and vaguely charge the dance hall owners with all future responsibilities, I am afraid that these bosses will not be able to turn stone into gold, and the problem will still be very serious.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to emphasize two points: (1) All actions of the government must be in accordance with the law. If orders are used to replace laws, it will only increase chaos. Especially at the beginning of constitutional rule, it is even more important not to be the first to act illegally. (2) We must not be content to fall behind and only open reverse gears.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Fundraising Shortfall: Hoping for Generous Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Qingxia Orphaned, Widowed, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund, sponsored by this newspaper, received a total of thirteen applications for the twentieth time. Among them, those with incomplete procedures were temporarily postponed, and after investigation, nine applications were approved. In addition to sending special letters of notification, the list is also published below. It is hoped that the applicants will affix their original seals to the attached receipts after receiving the notification letters and come to the office to collect the funds:</p>
<p>Name　Approved Amount</p>
<p>Zhang Peng　700,000 yuan</p>
<p>Wang Yimin　700,000 yuan</p>
<p>Wu Shujiang　800,000 yuan</p>

<p>Ling Chahua　800,000 yuan</p>
<p>In addition, due to the surge in the number of applications for this fund, the original fund is not enough to cover the expenses. It is hoped that generous people from the sea will generously donate to provide timely assistance to the suffering compatriots who are orphans, widows, poor, sick, and destitute, and to express human compassion.</p>
<p>Recently, Huaming Tobacco Company has been soliciting donations for the Qingxia Relief Fund and Poor Women's Maternity Assistance Fund during its nightly broadcast program on China Cultural Radio's "Air Bookstore." It has already collected a considerable amount. In addition to receiving it, this office would like to express its utmost gratitude on behalf of countless suffering compatriots.</p>
