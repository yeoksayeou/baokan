<h3>改革幣制積極　向美貨款仍談判中　新經濟案政院今將討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕頃自相當可靠方面獲悉：我國向美所提之改革幣制貸款，總額共為六億美元，其中二億美元係作為收回法幣之用，另四億美元則用作為新幣之基金，此項改革幣制貸款之談判，貝祖詒赴美時已開始商談，現仍在繼續談判中。前次貝祖詒氏自美返國，曾將談判情形有所報吿。李幹此次之返國，衆信亦有極詳盡之報吿，美國對我之希望，首在經濟情况之穩定，並必須從事財政經濟改革，而對於此次之美援，尤盼能妥為運用，至近來又復甚囂鏖上之幣制即將改革，並孫幣確已印就說，此間有關人士均認為尤屬言之過早。在幣制改革準備未充分前，當局對幣制改革，仍不敢貿然從事，惟現對於改革之準備更為積極耳。最近即將實行之新經濟方案，亦可視為改革幣制準備工作之一種。　〔本報南京十日電〕政務會議十一日舉行例曾，翁院長所擬新經濟方案，迄十日尙未向外透露，惟衆信十一日將提出於政務會中討論，俾能及早向各部會通令實施。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕中國赴美技術代表團團員李幹，來京出席美援運用委員會，並先後晋謁翁院長，王外長等，報告在美接洽貸款經過與美援運用之程序及技術問題，頃已公畢，十日夜軍返滬，十二日夜車再來京，出席十三日美援會與美經合總署駐華分署聯席會議。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕出售美援物資所得款項，央行決設立特別賬戶存儲，並正與中國，交通及上海市銀行洽商訂立合約，由各委託行經收款項，　繳中央銀行。按最近南京中央日報對三行爭取經手美援價款一節，曾作猛烈抨擊，認為居間營利，將破壞美援穩定物價之作用，惟中行負責人士則認為：所經手之款項，為奉令作國策性質之貸款，利息僅為一角三分，僅敷開支，且央行認為無此需要時，可隨時宣佈合約無效。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕據有關方面消息，聯合國糧農組織將與最近成立之農業復興聯合委會在技術上密切合作。據聯合國糧農組織負責人稱：該組織以理論上言之，與農業復興聯合委會毫無關係，前者為一國際機構，後者為中美兩國所組成，但糧農組織極願與該委會作技術上之合作，幷願予以一切顧問性質之協助。渠繼稱：在過去糧農組織曾協助中華救濟團，完成五三種農業復興計劃，南京附近之八卦州·湯山一帶之植樹，即為一例。查農業復興聯合委會，係於上星期四成立，該委設委員五人（中國三人美國二人）。</p>

<h3>拆放同業辦法　財部通令廢除</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕財部為加强控制金融起見，對於政院前頒布之「加强金融業務管制方法」，頃已重申前令，嚴格執行。並通令各省市銀行廢除部頒之「拆放同業」辦法六條，各省銀行不得再辦理拆放同業業務。</p>

<h3>美副領巴區返國述職　過滬談大連情況　經濟極少改進事業者有增無已　中外人士行動自由受嚴格限制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國駐大連副領事巳區，上月廿二日乘船離大連返國述職，道經上海，昨日午後假美國總領事館舉行記者曾，報吿大連近况。出席者什九為美籍記者，對蘇聯在大連之活動，詢問甚詳，足見美方對東北情勢之關切。據巴區氏稱：「依本人之判斷言之，在過去三年中，經濟情形極少改進，原料及重要設備之缺少，使高物價與廣泛之失業情形有增無已。</p>
<p>中外人士之行動與自動，均受到嚴格之限制。每一中國人之家庭，必須執有警察局所發之登記簿一册，內中記載每一家屬由一處市鎮至另一處市鎭之行動。家庭中如有一人欲在外過宿者，必須登記。在過去六個月內，對於意欲離開大連區之中國人，已加以更嚴格之管制。在一九四七年之夏秋二季，有不少中國人難此他去，當時許可證尙不難領，但自彼時以來，管制之情形愈趨嚴格，而目下移民之許可證僅能向關東警察局領取，且領取之手　極為麻煩。目下准訐離開大連之中國人，僅為搭乘沙船暫准前往磷區，目的顯然在於絕取合物之中國。</p>
<p>對於外籍居民，亦實施類似之限制，目下外僑居留地實　上僅限於蘇聯公民及美國領事署之人員，余雖擁有領事之職權，但余僅能在美國外交郵使到達之時，方得准許前往港口區。公路上重要據點所置之障礙物，使郊外之旅行大受限制。</p>
<p>在目前仃政當局所實施之社會　力，使中國公民無法與留居　地之少數外僑發生友誼或聯絡之關係」。</p>
<p>又據巴區氏透露：全市蘇僑，包括軍隊在內，約一萬人左右，海軍則僅有潛艇及驅逐艦留駐，商船甚多。駐軍司令為賴伐希金上校握有地方實　，受旅順海　基地司令包洛特羅夫之節制，中共所委派之市長，僅能過問民政而已。</p>

<h3>動盪中的西藏局勢</h3>
<p>由於西藏商務代表團的訪問美國，國內人士又開始注視西藏問題了。本報八日重慶訊：有關方面七日接得西藏電訊稱，去年四月遭現任攝政榮增打查砲燬之色拉寺，遇害之熱振然羽，因不甘久受壓破，頃聯合哲蚌寺揭旗反對榮增，聲勢浩大，榮增無法應付，聞有辭職謝罪之意。又金沙江西岸，駐康之藏軍調動頻繁，似有軍事動作。從最近一年來藏局動盪的情勢看來，西藏再度發生政變是可能的；榮增是否辭職，尤與中藏關係密切，所以我們對西藏政變的發展及其影響，不得不深切注意。</p>
<p>西藏地方的政治制度比較特殊，其政權敎權向握於達賴喇嘛之手。民國廿二年達賴十三世圓寂後，色拉，哲蚌，噶登三大寺（又名功德林，策德林，錫德林）公推四大呼圖克圖的熱振為攝政，掌握全藏的政敎大權。熱振靑年有為，思想進步，自執政以來，對內芟除貪汚，修明政治，頗獲人民愛戴；對外則一反達賴「親英反漢」政策，停止對靑康的內侵，儘量接近中央，同情祖國的對日抗戰，數度為抗戰勝利和死難軍民祈禱。民國廿七年轉生的達賴十四世拉木登珠，在靑海西寗附近尋獲，由中央協助護送入藏，一時中藏關係融融洩洩，打破民國以來的紀錄。然而，熱振因此遭受親英派的嫉恨，伏下禍苗；同時中央政府亦坐失爭取西藏眞正內附的良機，致熱振孤掌難鳴，遭人暗算，以致西藏大勢日非。</p>
<p>熱振事件發生於去年四月。緣事變之起，係親英派於民國卅一年藉口熱振星宿不明，勸他退休，以免災難，熱振當時外乏援助，內受脅迫，乃將攝政職位讓其師榮增打查代行，言明兩年後交還。詎料榮增貧圖權勢，代行攝政後，澈底掃除熱振勢力，並於去年四月十四日將熱振拘捕下獄，五月七日加以毒斃，暴尸拉薩市街。當熱振被拘時，色拉寺五千喇嘛曾要求釋放，榮增不但不接受，反派兵兩團包圍色拉，一塲血戰之後，色拉寺被燬了，僧徒大部罹難，小部逃離拉薩。這次事變說明了「親英反漢」勢力的抬頭，並將陰謀進行西藏獨立。</p>
<p>年來西藏局勢動盪不安，尤其印度獨立以後，西藏情况日非，這都是熱振死後的惡果。印藏公路的修築，與康靑邊境接壤，顯然是有國際背景的。藏軍陳兵靑康邊境，飲戈金沙江上，顯然是有內侵意圖的。商務代表團的飛往美國，與美國朝野進行通商貿易，顯然是要與美國單獨建立外交關係或商務關係。此種離心的意團，榮增打查攝政要負責，他代表西藏少數人的野心，陰謀離叛中華領土主權的完整，當然為西藏多數人所反對。尤其是全藏宗敎法權中心的三大寺，思想純正，敬愛中華，他們為熱振復仇，為西藏建太平，他們自不容忍榮增貪慾的野心。基於這個情勢，我們認為西藏新的政變是非常可能的，推翻動增的運動乃　必然的趨勢。西藏三大寺為全藏人民思想的明燈，他們自覺的起來推到暴政，如果他們這次革命成功，為西藏前途說，西藏的前途是光明的。目前的陰森空氣必將一掃而空，毫無疑議，</p>
<p>最後，我們還要特別指出，西睡的邊防，關係中亞及我國數省的安危。尤其在國際紛爭錯綜複雜的今天，政府對於帕米爾和喜馬拉雅山的風雲變化，應該予以深切的注意；幷且還要進一步講求良好對策，以爭取邊疆民族的內附，或協助邊胞改革現狀，提高其生活水準，使其達於眞正的地方自治之域，完成融合的民族家庭，民族國家的建立。</p>
<h3>我向義訂購人絲　價值約為美金二百萬元　一部份以易貨方式輪入</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕工商部息一：人造絲之輸入，以義大利貨佔最大多數，其他國家之貨為數極微，倘分別轉委人造絲進口商辦理，恐時間延誤，不及供應國內迫切需要，且分向各國訂購花色旣屬複雜，品質又不一致，對於整個配售頗有困難中央信託局有鑒及此，乃向義國訂購價值美金二百萬元之義產人造絲，但為節省外匯起見，一部份用易貨方式輸入，聞業已逕洽義方簽訂易貨合約，該易貨合約內，除義方純以人造絲一項輸入外，計我國輸出者有桐油，茶油，胡麻子油，菜油，萆麻油，花生，芝蔴，大豆，向日葵子，喂馬豆，各種子餅，駱駝毛及羊毛，鎢（百分之六十五成分），苧麻，　麻，棉子油等</p>

<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十日電〕頃悉：史達林將在西方使節及莫洛托夫商妥重要細節後，親自批準任何對總決議。觀察家相信，美大使史密斯及其英法同僚與莫氏談話竣事後，將再度與史達林會議。九日夜三小時談話之結果仍嚴守秘密。三使節向本國政府報吿前，曾在英使館會商一小時，僉料彼等一俟接獲本國政府之訓令，即將與蘇高級官員再度會晤。若達林及西方政府批准協議，則外長會議僅為手續問題·但目前除談判為時久遠外，尙無跡象表示已有完全協議。談話可能僅限於外長會議之條件，然四國外長下月在巴黎會晤前，或可能已先在莫斯科獲致整個協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓九日電〕據可靠方面息：駐莫斯科西方三專使與莫洛托夫之會談，可望因比獲得諒解，而取銷柏林之封鎖，並舉行四强外長會議。目前之談話志在獲致諒解，以求達到下列目標：（一）取消柏林封鎖；（二）在經四強接受之條件下，容許蘇聯貨幣在柏林全境流通；（三）展緩定九月間　行之西歐盟軍總司令與西德各邦總理之會議。比一方面並略述草斯科談判之大要如下：第一次三專使謁見史達林與莫洛托夫時，曾研究（一）取銷柏林封鎖之可能性，提供交換條件，容許蘇聯貨幣流行於柏林全境；（三）召開四强外長會議，以討論整個德國問題。星期五西方代表會晤莫洛托夫時送致備忘錄，略陳各本國政府於第一次與史達林莫洛托夫會談後所抱之態度。此備忘錄中並未云及西方三强接受倫敦對西德問題協議之展緩實施，但曾云及至少西方盟軍總司令與西德各邦總理之會議可望展緩舉行。聞莫洛托夫當時曾謂四强管制蘇聯貨幣在柏林之發行，無異以管制柏林經濟生活之權授予西方三强，此殊損及蘇聯之地位。今日第三次會議時，聞莫洛托夫曾提出反建議，而欲將柏林琉通之貨幣完全由蘇聯統制，並欲展緩倫敦對西德協議之實施。西方三專使曾詳細討論蘇聯之反建議，並圖覓取若干修正文。可靠方面强調該問題現擬根據西方三强於第一次與史莫會議後所提出之具體建議，並今日蘇聯提出之反建議作一折衷辦法。四强外長會議必須於獲致此折衷辦法後始能召開。至於該會議之結果若何，該可靠方面則抱謹愼之樂觀，據謂現因取銷柏林封鎖與召開四强會議之手續皆非輕易能成之事，故對召開此會議之同意反居次要矣。</p>

<h3>小史達林的幕後生活（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（原文載八月十七日出版的美國「觀察雜誌」）</p>
<p>帳下吏養尊處優</p>
<p>有一次伐雷萊到莫斯科去，穿戴了全副軍裝和勳章見他的父親，漂亮地向那總司令述職道：「史史達林上校拜見大元帥·」這位厭倦的元帥對於他兒子的成就毫不表示興趣，僅冷冷地回答迫：「這都是諾維可夫所幹的，他有意把你晋級，想籍此博得我的歡心。可是記着：除非你眞正靠了自己的力量得到那銜頭，我決不簽署那張保舉你晋升將軍的命令。」</p>
<p>上校垂頭喪氣回到隊部裏，把他父親的話告訴他的夥伴們，接着恨恨地說：「父親担任這樣的職位到底是不很好的，我又不好去作弄他，我只得等待他老人家自己發慈悲心了」</p>
<p>這樣的一位父親固然會妨碍伐雪萊企求將軍職位的野心，但是如果沒有他，伐雪萊恐怕未必會過着大多數高級將領們所夢想不到的豪華生活吧。上校有四輛從莫斯科輸入的精美的汽車，他的食物和必需品都由克林姆商店供給，這些商店專以上等的酒類，罐頭食物，魚子醬，香烟和襯衫等，供給享有特權的顧客。當他的部隊換防時，他的軍需部替他找尋最精美的行營，佈置寬大舒適的床，雪白的綢被，以及無綫電，鋼琴等，陳設之精緻，遠非前綫生活所可冀及的。他的衣服就是他父親的裁縫製的，他時常遊息於高加索山中最上等的娛樂塲所。祗有政洽局的同人—他們是蘇聯的天之驕子—纔能和伐雪萊媲美一下。</p>
<p>耽逸樂澤阨境部屬</p>
<p>不過話得說回來，伐雪萊上校雖然養尊處優，却也處處為他的部隊着想。他常常利用他的名字打電話給最高軍需機關，大聲呌着：「我是史達林」，要求他們發給租借物資的制服，新鮮的食物和溫暖的舶來品內衣，給他部下的空軍人員應用。他門在部隊的食堂裏吃着美國澤猪肉，鮮肉，煉乳，可可，巧克力，乳酪和白麵包，而其他的部隊接連幾個月老是吃些一小米粥和不新鮮的食物，此外他又時常帮助他部下的家屬。</p>
<p>因此伐雪萊很得他部除的愛戴，然而因為他缺乏將才和軍事經驗，他們並不以司令官尊敬他。表面上一切命令都通過他的，但實際上的司令官却是和他同伍出身的那位助手。嚴重的工作都不使伐雪萊任，因為他缺少忍耐工夫，同時抖亂非凡，成事不足，敗事有餘。</p>
<p>有一大一架載有炸彈的飛機在部隊的飛機塲裏突然燦炸。伐氏立刻把幾個軍官扣押起來。他幾次呌他的部下排列着，自己握着手槍踱來踱去，大聲呌喊要親自槍斃那破壞者。幾天以後，另外一架飛機又突然爆炸，經調查後確定那爆炸是由於炸彈本身的缺陷。</p>

<h3>民營輪船不靠首都　由於無票乘客太多　當局正商補救辦法</h3>
<p>據航業界息：交通部近因南京一埠，除國營招商局船隻上下水均停靠外，其餘民營公司船隻均不停靠，以致乘客特別擁擠，待船疏運，曾分令航政局及輪船業公會，所有民營船隻務須在南京停靠，但各民營公司鑒於首都無票乘客太多，且均係集體行動，船一靠岸，立即蜂擁上船，維持碼頭秩序之軍警亦感無法制止，此輩上船之後，不僅無票坐船，而且强佔艙位，搶飯搶菜，動輒行兇毆打船員，以致眞正出錢購票之旅客，反不能獲得應有之待遇，對船公司紛紛責難。加之船上載客數量，航政局均有規定，倘逾量搭載，萬一出事，船公司所負責任更大。因此各民營公司在首都治安機關對於無票乘客未有澈底防止辦法之前，依然不敢輕於嘗試，堅請交通部予以切實保證，然後遵令停靠。刻交通部正與國防部南京衛戍司令部及首都警察廳等機關會商中。</p>

<p>京滬路局目前面臨一重大困難，即為購票時點驗鈔票之時間浪費極大，平均每一張車票，所費點鈔票之時，　需一分鐘，按路局規定車票發售時間，須在車開前二小時，則二小時之內，僅能售出車票一百二十張，不獨旅客不便，且路局本身營業收入亦受鉅大影響，路局曾考慮以本票購買車票，結果認為偽造者勢必大批發現，實行困難。目前為解除售票困難起見，除增開票窗外，並老慮兩點：（一）各機關團體及公司廠商，於事先與該局訂約，於購買車票時，得使用蓋有該公司印　之本票，（二）請旅客盡量利用電　購買，至第一項是否將付諸實施，現正期重考慮中。</p>
<h3>飛快車今晨駛滬　作第四度之試車</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兩路局冷氣飛快車，自上月出廠後冷氣設備屢次發生障碍，近聞經戚　堰機廠各工程師悉心研究結果，對冷氣裝置困難，已漸能克服·日前會作鎮江與戚　堰間短程試車，雖尙有若干處未畫如理想，然較以前已有顯著進步，回廠後巳再加改進。路局副局長兼　務處長謝震，特於昨晨親往戚　　撿視，昨日據戚廠傳來消息，飛快車將於今晨由謝副局長親自駕駛來滬，作第四度試車。是否重作京滬全程試車，胥視今晨之試車成績而定，一般人之預料，此次試車當不致再如以前之發生障礙也。</p>

<h3>接管粉廠　節外生枝　煽動工人施強暴　債權人兩項罪嫌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕常州人談鐵城慈谿人徐文濟兩人，係本市新康麵粉廠無擔保　權團代表，民國卅五年十二月十九日，曾與該廠廠主朱梅蓀訂和解筆錄，至同月卅日，徐·談二人即依據筆錄第一項規定前　接管該廠，但留廠工人以未得廠主通知，故不允交出，至卅六年三月間，徐·談二次前往接管，又無結果，八月十日朱即函允於七日內解決，並稱：如再延期，願依和解筆錄第七項規定，一切抵押品由債權團自由處分。但屆期朱又未履行，同月廿入日雙方又訂立一新和解契約，將債權折合國幣十四億元，定九月卅日先還二成計二億八千萬元，以後陸續撥付，詎到期該支票又遭退票。同年十月二日徐·談因朱新舊契約均不履行，極感憤懣，乃邀同榆林路警分局司法股員孫仲軒及持槍男子三人前往該廠，强欲接收，雙方堅特至下午九時仍未解決，徐·談乃煽動該廠工人，實施强暴，將朱等毆傷，事後朱即據情報吿警局，將徐·談二人拘解地檢處，依法訊辦，此案業經該處偵查終結，依妨害自由及傷害罪提起公訴。</p>

<h3>糧食緊急購儲會　已在滬正式成立　配合美援統籌民食供應</h3>

<h3>參會小組決議公用事業售價　另訂計算標準　取消自動調整公式　明日開會再付討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會公用小組研究會，於昨日上午繼續召開會議，出席參議員費樹聲，李文杰·姜豪，汪竹一，徐學禹，嚴諤聲，水祥雲，瞿鉞，張中原，邵永生等，列席公用局趙局長，主席姜豪。席間對公用事業之加價問題，作進一步之檢討，提供比較具體之改進辦法。經綜合各參議員提供之意見，最後歸納，得審查意見六項。十二日將再召開公用委員會，俾將昨日小組會議審查意見·提會討論，並決定召開臨時大會之日期。茲探誌昨日決定之審查意見六項如次：</p>
<p>（一）請市府立即取消公用事業價格自動調整公式。</p>
<p>（二）請求中央對於公用事業用油，豁免關稅及附加稅。</p>
<p>（三）請求中央對於公用事業所需一切器材油料之外匯及燃煤，一次預結或預購三個月，以後並以三個月為一期，按期預結預購。</p>
<p>（四）凡美援物資中可以供給之油料及器材配件，應以最低價格計算，此點除請求中央外，並請市府逕向美援運用委員會交涉。</p>
<p>（五）請中央銀行繼續按月貸款。</p>
<p>（六）自九月份起，原有公式取消後，請公用局根據下列原則，另訂計算標準，其計算標準原則如后：</p>
<p>說明：因公用事業價格計算公式，係全國經濟委員會原所訂定者，復經修正。以電價計算公式為例，每度業務費用基數參入當地五金材料價格指數，原僅為百分之十，其後竟修改為生活指數百分乏六十，及五金指數百分之四十，其不合理至為明顯。如繼續採用，無非加重市民不合理之負担，亟就停止採用。故擬以下列原則，作公用事業價格計算之暫行標準：</p>
<p>八項原則　作計價標準</p>
<p>（一）油煤料器材等基數，就以本年一月至六月實際指數平均計算之。譬如每度電用煤基數（本年一至六月份平均數），乘上平均煤價，每度電用油基數（本年一至六月份平均數）乘上平均價，每度電物料維持費（資本支出性質之項目應剔除，幷須根據加　平均法計算之成本），乘上月市府編製之五金價格指數等是。</p>
<p>（二）股息利息取消以美金計算。</p>
<p>（三）職工生活指數，應照上月份兩次之平均數計算之，幷不得預加。（譬如每度電職工底薪（本年一至六月），乘以上月份上下月平均之工人生活指</p>
<p>（四）稅額應照成本總數，再以稅率百分比計算之。</p>
<p>（五）五金指數應以上月份四週之平均數計算之，幷不應以黑市價計算，更不應附加　稅。</p>
<p>（六）業務費應予减低。譬如每度電應負祖之折舊費，不在使用中之機器，不應計算折舊。以電為例，就是每度電應　担之其他支出，以上月份之實際支出，减除煤油物料維持費折舊費及職工薪津外之部份為準。但股息外匯負債之抵補支出，不包括在內，公開實際支出，就由公用局詳加審核。</p>
<p>（七）外籍職員及高級職員，應與其他員工同工同酬，不得過分優待。</p>
<p>（八）人工基數，應以本年一至六月　際平均計算之。</p>
<p>另外關于外籍職員人數及實際收入，請公用局查明公布。</p>
<h3>直接稅局裁百餘人</h3>
<p>被裁人員今商對策</p>
<p>直接稅局實行緊縮，昨已正式通知各被裁人員，計裁减一百十餘人之多。被裁人員對當局之措施，頗表示不滿，尤以考試及格人員及轉業軍官為最。彼等定今晨在局內召開會議，商討對策。</p>
<h3>禁烟毒條例期滿　地院暫停審毒案</h3>
<p>政府前於民國三十五年八月二日公佈施行之禁烟禁毒治罪條例，業於本年八月二日屆滿，而新條例迄禾公佈，致地院受理之烟毒案件，即於三日起停止進行審理，靜待新令，而王者賓販毒案亦因之展期審理。</p>
<h3>水泥出口應給外匯　允調整為百分六十</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕水泥業公會因目前國內建設停頓，水泥銷路日少，若不向國外推銷，則各廠生產勢難維持，本年上半年曾由台灣等公司向甫洋輸出三萬二千二百噸。惟近一二月來，美國·蘇聯·日本三國水泥競向南洋傾銷，而國產水泥外銷，政府限定給予外匯百分之五十五，以供輸入原料。依月前情形，外銷水泥碼頭交貨價（FOB）每噸約合美金十六元，僅及製造成本百分之六十五，無法與美蘇·日商競爭，爰經推派陳範有等代表五人進謁輸管會霍主委，及輸出推廣處陳處長，陳述困難情形，請求將限定給予之外匯百分比提高，以坍加原料輸入。聞霍主委已允將比率由百分之五十五調整為百分之六十。</p>
<h3>破壞校長名譽　張貼傅單　校董被訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立江淮閘北小學校校董戴政卿，因不滿該校校長王秉之為人，乃在王之住宅前後門及校中玻璃窗上，張貼傳單，上寫：「王秉人格卑汚，素行不端，亳無資歷，且藉公營私，將學校賬目含糊公布，近聞私行募捐入囊，殊堪痛恨，着即撤職」等語。正受此侮辱，乃具狀控戴妨害名譽，經地檢處數度偵查，戴力加否認，據稱傳單上之字跡與渠本人所書者不同，但經證人蔣鳳翔，張日通，指證戴確曾親自張貼散布屬實，乃依妨害名譽罪嫌提起公訴。</p>

<h3>回胞朝觀團　首批今出國　隨带日常用品甚夥　須至年底能歸國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕甘·靑·新三省回胞朝覲團，全部團員計一百六十人，在團長華德爾，　團長沈臨瀚，馬榮卿率領下，已分批陸續抵滬。該團原定行程為乘船經由香港，新加坡，再換專輪直放麥加聖地。但以滬港間船位不數，故臨時改為數批出發，首批四十八人，今晨先乘盛京輪首途赴港，其餘則分別於明後兩日乘機飛香港集中。中國回敎協會總幹事丁玲亭昨特由京來滬照料。據談：西北回胞一生中有「五功」必須做到，即「念」，「禮」，「齋」，「課」，「朝」，赴聖地朝覲乃五功之一，故回胞極為重視，每人均以一生中能去麥加一次為最大慰藉。政府因尊重回胞信仰，自去年起特規定每年遣送回胞赴聖地朝觀一次，今年雖値國家經濟困難，惟仍准撥外匯七千二百鎊，供該團出國之需。該團此次前往麥加須滯留至年底方能歸國，預計每一團員約需外匯三百鎊，現政府外匯配額每人祗有三十五鎊，不敷之數，將由各團員申請自備外匯補充。該團昨表示政府對渠等之護照，外匯等每年均於極迅速時間內辦妥，使回胞出國朝覲事宜能順利達成，西北全體同胞極感德意。該團此次因留居國外較久，故行囊中除整套炊具外，每人並隨身携有藥品，及「君白」（即朝聖禮服）「合斯塔爾」（即纏頭用之白布），凈　，調料等甚夥。</p>

<h3>關外行（五）　塞上江南</h3>
<p>— 本報記者宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報闌州二日航訊〕敦煌下午九時以後才日落，我們晚飯之後，仍有許多時間去街上遊覽。敦煌的大街不多，但小巷却有幾十條，都以甘肅各州縣命名，據說遜淸雍正六年本城落成後，移來甘肅各州縣的人民，分境而居，所以逕以地名為巷名了。</p>
<p>在關外三縣一局中，敦煌的面積最大，有十四萬餘平方公里，至少有十五萬畝以上的肥美土地，宜於農耕，溝渠縱橫，在水利上很少糾紛。我們出城到黨河邊看落日，在沙漢地帶上看到參大的楊柳，連陌的平疇，翻騰的河流，機密的菓園，恍如置身江南。敦煌的瓜果，昔為進貢之物，素負盛名，可惜我們來時尙未成熟，只有梨廣杏一種，喫起來與蘭州杏有不同的滋味。河西各地俱不產棉，獨有敦煌年產棉花七十餘萬斤，人民紡紗織成土布，衣着可以自給。今年的雨水適宜，可收穫小麥十餘萬石。</p>
<p>敦煌人口漸減</p>
<p>敦煌的人口，也一天天在减少，過去漢唐時一郡六縣，有十三萬人，現在則只有一個尾數。另有蒙古人六百多，寓居南湖一帶，編一直屬保由縣管轄。這些流亡的大漢子孫，已失去了强弓刁馬的遊收能力，給當地人做起佃農了。</p>
<p>閨女濃粧豓抹</p>
<p>敦煌有一特殊風俗，便是每逢廟會時，凡未出嫁的閨女，一律濃裝豔抹，由四鄉趕到會塲上去，任人評頭論足，不以為侮。年輕的小伙子，在人羣中竄來竄去，尋求對象，然後探聽身世，挽人說媒。這裏的神敎尤其興盛。在卅年重建的關帝廟內，看到一柄重約一百八十斤的大鐵刀，兩個人抗起來還很喫力。在廟旁還立有幾半截大唐都督楊公紀德碑和大唐河西道歸義軍節度使索公紀德碑等。鼓樓前的「小　山」燈棚，據縣誌載：從前的元宵燈節，盛况不亞西京，現在的人民，巳很少這種佳興了。</p>
<p>古玉門關陽關</p>
<p>城西數十里爲古玉門關，即漢人疏中「但願生入王門關」之地。西南數十里有陽關，即唐人詩句中「西出陽關無故人」之地。兩關以外，只有弔古戰塲文「浩浩乎，平沙無垠，勞不見人……黯兮慘悴，風悲日矄，」可以形容。</p>
<p>紅柳當作燃料</p>
<p>敦煌最感缺乏的是燃料問題，附近亳無煤產，人民燃燒的是草湖裏的紅柳和多種野草，目前砍柴的地點一天天遠了，還和鄰境鬧着搶柴的糾紛，將來野柴伐盡，煤源猶未開闢，怕附近樹林將要淪於浩刧了。</p>
<p>哈族今昔動態</p>
<p>敦煌和安西人民最感咸脅的，便是寄居南山的哈薩人的騷擾，哈薩克民旅，多居天山北部的阿山區，廿二年新疆「四二一」政變後漸向東移，和鎭西的哈民會合。哈民生性喜動，極不願受拘束，更不願改變生活方式。盛世才執政後，取恐怖手段，一味鎮壓，哈民恫於赤化，乃以甘肅為樂土，紛紛來歸。廿五·六年，進入祁連山，將原有的蒙人逐出，不上幾年，都置有牛羊馬駝，日臻富裕。去年二月，政府會資遣大部回新，現在只有兩千四百人據住安敦之南山遊收，不時出山來搶掠牲畜。據敦煌縣長說：還有少數人　植鴉片，我們在敦煌時，便有縣府派去紅柳溝查剷烟苗的差人回來復命，聽說種植的面積很大，但無人看守。</p>
<p>現在南山的哈民，由胡賽音，阿岡巴依等六頭目領導，年來軍政當局一再允許資遣返新，但他們總不肯痛痛快快的走，今年答應自八月一日起陸續起程，大家都希望這一次不再令人失望。</p>

<h3>可怕的酣睡病　防治方法值得注意</h3>
<p>〔中央社成都十日電〕可怕的酣睡病襲成都軍校學生，己有因罹此病而死者，記者晤及軍校校醫白鑫，據談發病原因眞狀治療預防方法如下：</p>
<p>（一）種類：本症有（A）（B）兩種型，（A）型散發於歐美，各地甚少流行。（B）型又分為聖路易（B）型及日本（B）型二種，前者流行於美國之聖路易城附近，後者流行於日本及中國，印度，兩者病原病理解剖及流行情况大致相同，惟死亡率前奢為百分之二零，後者較高約為百分之六零至七零，老年和小兒死亡率更高，現軍校所發現即屬於後者，即日本（B）型流行性大腦炎。</p>
<p>（二）病原及傳染：本病於一九三三年發現於美國之聖路易城，病原為濾過性毒，該病菌大小約為二十至三十箝倫，繁殖於生活之細胞中，培養基中不能生存，傳染媒介為猶中間宿主為馬羊兎等，惟四十五歲以下者患之較多，傳染多於夏季，部外較城市患者多，潛伏期為四至廿一日。</p>
<p>（三）症狀：按臨牀病狀之輕重可分為三類，（一）第一類為三類中之最嚴重者，無前驅症狀，幾突然發高熱，惡心嘔吐，頭痛昏睡，額部强直等症，臨牀檢查可尼氏現象，陽性，運動失調，腹壁淺反射消失，深反射增强，眼肌麻痺，腦脊髓液壓力增高，球蛋白及糖質增高，細胞數目亦增多。（二）第二類主為頭痛發熱腹痛不適等症，間亦有發喉痛及結合膜炎者，（三）第三類症狀極輕微，僅有頭痛及輕熱，至脊髓液無變化。</p>
<p>（四）診斷，以臨牀症狀及檢查腦脊髓液可以診斷，如腦脊髓液力增高，球蛋白及細胞數增高等，最確實之診斷方法為中和法及補足固定法試驗。</p>
<p>（五）治療及预役：無特效療法，主要為症狀治療，應使患者移於空氣流通之病室避免刺激，如聲光等，注意營養，必要時可施滋養灌腸，鼻管滋養，注射百分之五零葡萄糖液，及生理鹽水於患者，不要予以鎮靜劑，　腦膜刺激症狀及减低腦脊髓壓力可抽放腦脊髓液，此外應注意合併症之發生。</p>
<p>（六）預防：確實者為預注射，惜本國無此菌苗，無法施行，一般的預防為隔離患者，勵行殺蚊防蚊，以用DDT撲滅病區之蚊虫為最佳。此外應注意衣食住行之日常衛生，以增强身體之抵抗力。總之，本病死亡率甚高，又無特新治療方法足以對本病之預防，應加注意。</p>
<h3>跟海寗怒潮搏擊　尖山塘工訪問記</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　楊樹生</p>
<p>〔本報海寗八日訊〕「海寗潮」是中外聞各的，在抗戰前，每逢農曆八月十八，這個古老的縣城裏，總是擠得水洩不通，熟鬧情形是任何節日所不及的。然而抗戰期間，錢江沿岸在敵偽鐵蹄蹂躪下，海塘年久失修，因而種下了大禍根，勝利後，錢江缺口林立，險象環生，當局為謀積極搶修，卅五年一月組織了「錢塘江北岸緊急搶修委員會」及工程處，至八月改組為「浙江省錢塘江海塘工程局」，分設杭海，鹽平，紹蕭三段工程處，積　展開了搶修工作。</p>
<p>無休止的搶修</p>
<p>錢江北岸海塘，要算海寗縣境內的最為險要，經過了塘工局二年餘的努力，現在已完成了的有：（一）尖山輕便鐵道及採石工塲，（二）爵字號石塘，（三）新倉跳水壩，（四）陳文港柴塘工程，（五）七里廟塘·棠·鐘·隸·四字號柴塘工程。（六）八堡石塘工程。現在正進行搶修中的，有牧港·七里廟·陳汶港等地的挑水壩工程，而已完工的爵字號石塘及新倉挑水壩最近因受怒潮的衝擊，又吿坍損，這種不斷的搶修工程，永無休止地進展着，它掌握着沿塘數百萬人民的安危與災樂。</p>
<p>基石六排捲去</p>
<p>本月七日上午七時，由硤石專輸出發，到袁花後，即由塘工處招待乘了工程處的專車赴尖山，沿途一帶，正是海密稻螟害最嚴重地區，農民們在烈日下捕捉螟虫，沒有一些倦意，這種忍耐堅苦的精神，使人有無限的感慨。抵陳洨港是，怒潮正洶湧而來，上塘飛滾而去，再回到七里廟時，十一堡地方的挑水壩，基石六排已被捲去，這種駕人消息，實在是够使人凜然的。</p>
<p>尖山的採石工程，現在進行得最為順利，平均每日　產石二百噸，是項石塊，須用壓縮機控制採石機的動力，經過大型起重機的力量，把巨大的石塊搬運至小型火車上，運赴各施工地處，並且有拖輪數艘，專門運裝碎石赴蕭紹等地應用。</p>
<p>挑水壩的建築</p>
<p>塘工局在海寗的工程重心，現在是在建築挑水壩，挑水壩的最大功効是在於保坍，以阻止海沙外流，使塘身堅固，不致損壞，它的主要材料是椿木及石塊，用直徑一尺許長五十餘公尺的洋松木，以打椿機打入海底廿餘公尺後，再以厚太板連接夾住，在空隙間置以巨大石塊。這種工程，逢到大潮汛時，往往半途被冲毀，然而為了經費關係，在沒有能力建築石塘前，這工程是最　要的，而塘工局對此，亦深貝信心。</p>
<p>工人日夜工作</p>
<p>塘工處的經費，現在是由中美救濟合作總署撥給，每月限用二百億元，因此許多工程，為經費所限而無法能展開。他們每天動員三百多工人分二班日夜工作，與巨浪鬥爭，這種精神是值得歌頌的。</p>
<p>海寗塘外漲沙已完全坍圯，怒潮好幾次冲上岸來，「觀潮節」又將到了，預料今年的八月十八，將是空前熱鬧擁擠的，要使海寗潮」不致湮沒，同時使沿塘數百萬人民獲取安全的保障，此項搶修工程是應該促起大衆的注意的。</p>

<h3>廿五萬票面關金券　下週起普遍發行　國行當局否認將發行新幣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳「孫幣」將於新經濟方案公佈之日發行，並謂新幣與法幣比率為一比四百萬，與美金比率為二比一。記者特詢之中央銀行發行局陳副局長延祚，據謂：「絕無此事，惟二十五萬票面之關金券，準於下週起發行」。幷認為改革幣制時機及條件，尚未成熱。外傳中央印製廠正趕印新幣說，絕對不確。彼不知除法幣與關金外，尚有何種新幣。至於鈔荒問題，負責方面，認為日內即可逐漸轉好。五百萬元大鈔，巳籌備就緒，下週一起，全國各地普遍發行，而印製效率，最近亦有進步。按日來市面現鈔恐慌，已達極點，理由為物價漲勢太快，現有法幣之票面額已不够支付，廿五萬關金問世後，當可鬆弛一時，惟據有資格人士之觀察，以今日通貨膨脹之速率推算，三個月之後，現有之大鈔恐又將不能應付市面之需要云。</p>
<h3>業外刺激加強　華股漲風瀰漫</h3>
<p>華股昨漲風在大戶落手做多，及圈外週期漲風掀起下，曲折向逐步擴大，前市業已揭開序幕，後市變本加厲，永紗以一五五一〇元新高峯漲停，與美亞同須貼價做開，餘股漲停者亦達十餘種。</p>
<p>最初因報載經濟改革消息沉悶，人心稍穩，除小型股景福受罷工牽累，開了低盤外，永紗則以一四一八〇元登塲，八九號六九號一六九號一三一號二三號一一六號一五二號一六〇號一四三號二一二號九五號一九七號一四號一一七號各大戶均進，漲到一四八〇〇元。此時頗多小曲折，美亞新買殷切，最為俏利，紗布各物均起漲風，二二四號一〇四號一四八號一五五號一三七號六五號一六號進至一五三〇〇元，榮豐美亞等漲達限度，二二四號一六九號一七二號二二八號一一七號二一八號二〇七號脫手，回低至一五〇五〇元。港電報六分，四號一五一號七六號五五號一六九號進至一五三五〇元新高峯，一九九號一四三號二二四號略有脫手，午收一五二六〇元。除火柴信誼統益華新中泥中興漲停，上泥微升外，美亞中絲信和內衣榮豐梅林漲停後有回，與餘股同漲半成到一成。</p>
<p>後市業外之刺激更為加强，永鈔上塲即以新高峯一五五一〇元漲停板，美亞信和等十三種亦達漲限，永紗高價須加二五〇元，二〇七號九九號一三四號一四八號八九號逢高脫手，曲折而下，美亞自加十元退至漲限內，永紗亦盤小到一五四五〇元。一般推測，國行差進將達三萬億之多也。但人心已吿轉變，買戶佔優勢，經六五號八九號一七三號等再進，臨收前又須加二百餘元，最後在一〇〇元至一五〇元間徘徊，美亞五元至十元。較晨收計永紗美亞信和梅林統益大通火柴中泥聯地閘北中興華新上泥信誼恒豐漲停板，榮豐華豐景綸新光中絲五和中法新華小升，國貨　安內衣尚平，勤興商務微挫，塲外各未上市股票，仍以文化公用南洋五洲華成中興為秀，餘呈平庸</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨亦被股市所帶好，惟初時一度失望而稍疲，統丙晨開一六〇萬，低價一五九萬，漲到一八一萬，而後小盤。五五〇室五五二室賣出，五〇〇室五〇三室三六〇至均進，成交約四百萬，較前收計甲乙戊各漲八萬元，丙昂十二萬元，丁種亦升七萬元。</p>
<h3>救國公債等　昨抽籤還本</h3>
<p>救國公債第八次還本，民國二十七年金公債關金債票美金債票英金債票第十九次還本，民國二十九年軍需公債第一期債票第十三次還本，第二期債票第十二次還本，民國二十九年建設金公債第一期英美金債票第十三次還本，第二期英美金債票第十二次還本，民國三十年建設公債第一期債票第十一次還本。民國三十一年同盟勝利美金公債第十次還本，已於昨日上午九時，由財政部公債司在本市仁記路巾信局四樓公開舉行抽籤。此次共計中籤票二百六十四支，還本金額，計法幣一千九百八十萬元，關金四百四十萬元，美金七百七十萬元，美金五十四萬元。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆現鈔缺　行局昨反出為進</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根走勢仍鬆，市塲現鈔籌碼仍極缺乏。四行二局一庫於銀錢業票據交換巾，一反日來之大量差出，而有二二六一〇億之差進。就中中央銀行差進六〇八億，中國銀行差進二六一七一億，交通銀行差進一四六〇億，農民銀行差出四七六八億，中信局差出三〇一三億，郵匯局差進一一五六億，合作金庫差進一〇九五億。商業行莊大交換差出二五四一七億，小交換差出一九六七一億，外商銀行共計差進二六一七一億。</p>
<h3>國行物資財務委會　議定購售菸草辦法</h3>
<p>中央銀行物資財務委員會第五次會議，經決議有關收購及配魯物資案多起，重要者有收購開灤煤礦煤斤，及應本市烟廠業之要求，議定收購及配售產地菸草辦法。此外對於定貨貸款辦法收購物品之範圍，以及銷售方法等技術上之問題，亦經詳予研討。</p>
<h3>禁止票據抵用　金管局決不解禁</h3>
<p>本市銀錢信託三業同業公會昨曾聯合呈文財政部，響應市商會對財部之請求，認為限制票據抵用，試行失敗，請求回復抵用原狀，表示贊同，並促財部解除禁令，以利金融流通。茲據財部上海金管局負責人吿稱，關於票據抵用問題，係政府旣定國策，決不能　時予以更動者。近日因市面現鈔缺乏，致本票充斥大鈔發現貼水等情事，而各方對種種難題，俱屬罪於限制票據抵用，祇须現鈔缺乏情形改善後，即可好轉。固不足為慮。換言之，票據抵用對壓制信用膨脹，實有重大作用。政府決不放棄此項要策云。</p>
<h3>工業會籌備會商討　如何利用自備外匯</h3>
<p>本市工業會籌備會為討論如何利用僑資及自備外匯辦法，特於昨日下午三時召關小組會，出席田和卿洪念組胡西觀郭永熙等十餘人。當決義：（一）利用僑資及國人在外存款並放寬原料及生鹽器材進口限額，惟國內已有之製成品，不得越例請求。（二）再生產之資金，准許工廠結匯，向國外採辦原料及生產器材。至輸管會前嘗恐開放僑資自備外匯後，資金回國，可能流向黑市，此點已不必過慮。工業會並定日內會同進出口貿易協會及工業協會再開聯席會議，作進一步之研討，擬訂辦法，送輸管會參考。</p>
<h3>紗市堅俏買風旺盛　棉布壘創新高價　龍頭塲外曾喊八千萬零</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以環境消息利多，津粵等帮採辦重暢，本街因銀根鬆濫，塲內買風展開，市氣飛黃騰達。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即狂跳二億九千萬元，嗣因結匯證書行情回好，外銷有起色，並悉龍頭細布上揚，川漢等帮爭先搶購，市盤再昂至現出廿九億五千萬，明日出卅億結束，比較上日續漲三億九千萬至四億二千萬元。</p>
<p>其他谷支粗細紗，因本客兩帮俱有吸進，市盤普升成半至二成左右，成交一百零三件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因傳新經濟改革方案將延期宣佈，人心揣測又多，更以行局不絕差出，圈外物資相繼高翔，紗價均創新高峰，業中人久靜思動，塲內買氣驟盛。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，晨開先由北帮猛進，本市布商及徐州蚱埠等帮競吸，行情即見飛騰二百十萬元。嗣以業外游資活躍，漢口帮亦有收吸，喊價一路翱翔至七千四百八十萬元收盤，較上日回漲五百四十萬元，（最後以利買消息頻傳，價再哄高至七千六百五十萬尚不易搜購。午後塲外曾創八千零五十萬罕有之高峰，旋因紡建公司配貨標價平穩，籌碼寬鬆，結果喊七千七百萬元。）</p>
<p>此外五福喇叭童陽光等各檔細布，及粗細斜嗶嘰等，亦均回挺三百五十萬至五六百萬元不一，其餘色布士林布等，脚地亦趨堅硬，成交二千零四十疋。</p>
<p>紡建拋紗</p>
<p>中紡公司昨代中央銀行拋售棉紗四種，共計八七六件，准購一八八戶，價值一六五、七三一、〇〇〇萬元。又中紡公司昨售紗九種，准購四七〇戶，共售一四一六件，價值二八九、〇一二，〇〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>美棉價跌</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日專電〕因美政府發表報吿稱：美國今年棉產將為十一年來收成最佳之一次，故美棉每包價格今日已跌二元五角，仍有續跌趨勢。按我國乃美棉之一好主顧。</p>
<p>紗布外銷</p>
<p>國產紗布加强外銷事，益見積極，除各廠商籌組外銷公司外，日內又可有二千五百噸紗布將運銷新嘉坡·香港·仰光·等地，該批外銷紗布現已在報關中。目前香港·南洋等，對國產紗布之需求頗股，極多單帮客私携紗布，運各該地區出售，獲利頗豐。因此促使本市各紗廠加强運銷該處云。</p>
<h3>產價報昂貨主扳持　食米一致挺升　油市人心活動漲風猛烈</h3>
<p>米市又吿轉挺，產地堅昂，貨主售意甚淡，一致堅持加價，開盤即見挺升，由於曾因去路不振而吿定，收市終因業外各物上漲而挺昂。白粳四千五百五十萬，薄稻為四千八百八十萬元，嘉善新秈米以三千六百萬開出，特高粳四千八百萬元，一致挺升一百五十至二百萬元。收市堅俏，昨日到貨六千〇二十石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>激騰，由於業外各物之上漲，經濟新方案公佈有待，致人心堅昂，况銀根鬆濫，買聲不絕，老車粉由一七〇〇萬升為一七六〇萬元，兵船收市一七一〇萬，一致　升一百三十萬。紅蜂與建成均與兵船同價為一七一〇萬元，孔雀等雜粉均漲一百三四十萬，麩皮挺一百一二十萬，小麥廠盤未開。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>一致向榮，因業外各物均升，客帮見機納取甚多，銷化活絡，黃豆油頭帮納取，漲三百萬，苞米上漲不多，略加百萬。元麥汕靑二帮力吸，再勁漲三百萬元，蠶豆及菉豆客銷不動，僅本街納取，各略加五十至一百萬。明光紅糧二四五〇萬，芝蔴貨主扳持，上挺三百萬，生仁廣帮有進，重升七八百萬元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>復起猛烈漲風，人心活動，業外各物上漲，廠方先開高價，後市出籠再高。豆油軋升二千五百萬，生菜油一二五〇〇萬，亦漲二千五百萬，上升均達二成。吉桶生油猛升二千六百萬，小車蔴油挺二千萬。豆餅跟隨上漲，收市軋升一百一二十萬元。</p>
<h3>呢絨交易有限</h3>
<p>呢羬最近因時令及環境關係，兼以中紡開價無變動，尚屬風平浪靜，少有榮辱。交易方面，現定及零躉批售，均屬有限。定貨方面，來路貨除香港交貨外，本市早巳停止不談，本廠貨大廠家均欲自積現貨，善價出沽，不賞定出，小廠家定洋改收八成或十足，致定貨者亦甚形淸寂。</p>
<h3>青市中紡各廠　每週輪流減工</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島十日電〕青市中紡公司所屬各紡織廠，以原棉及主幹纖維缺乏，無法維持正常生產，九日起，每廠每週輪流减工二天，並電上海總公司，請求速予供應，以免被迫全部停工。</p>
<h3>燃管會辦結束　煤斤管制仍維原狀</h3>
<p>工商部燃管會業巳接獲結束之命令，該會已定本月三十日正式結束，並組織一辦事處，負責未了事宜。據悉：該會結束後，對於本市煤斤之管理，仍採取現行之分配方法。對於礦廠之礦價，亦將維持現行之定價收購原則。惟其中一部之煤斤，將允由礦商自由運銷。</p>
<h3>茶市脚底鞏固</h3>
<p>本年度祁門紅茶，自英商怡和·協和·錦隆·同孚等洋行，復起注視後，刻下雖仍垂愛，但終因存底枯薄，加以連日安徽茶葉公司及震和茶棧，積極向產區搬運之貨，尚未安抵此間，是以過程不脫供不應求之象，交易寥若晨星，潛勢力迭靄鋒鋩，行情則步趨上砌。其　花色，亦因銀根鬆濫逾恒，買氣亢奮，執主趁機拉抬，一致全面晉升，脚地均甚鞏固。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫</p>
<p>〔本報無錫十日電〕各物飛黃騰達，白粳收四五八四萬，白元四五〇四萬，羊秈四五七四萬，小麥四二〇〇萬，麵粉一六四〇萬，　油一二九〇〇萬，棉紗二〇億，綱布五洋一致上展。</p>

<h3>兩項新限制實施後　香港貿易感受影響</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港八月九日電〕據此間遠東經濟評論報論述，由於倫敦方面限制其殖民地與通用硬幣及半硬幣地區之貿易，香港或有可能退出英鎊區域。</p>
<p>兩項新限制令，已於最近實施。內容如下：</p>
<p>（一）自八月三日起，凡因出口貨物而僅得之外匯利益均應以官價折合，讓與香港政府。但出口至美國，菲列濱，澳門，朝鮮，日本，中國，及英鎊區域者，不在此限。</p>
<p>（二）自七月二十六日起，倫敦與香港間之英鎊匯款，均以五百鎊為限。</p>
<p>按舊法令規定，凡因出口某種貨物至金元國家所得之利益，全部應歸香港政府所有。</p>
<p>遠東經濟評論報稱，該新法令與「進口執照之臨時限制」，及英鎊匯款之管制辦法，使「香港繼續為金鎊區域之共同利益或不利益」，此問題之討論，成為必要。</p>
<p>「退出英鎊區域之後，對香港之目前及將來都有利益。多數經濟觀察家認為香港事實上僅為一大海港，不該包括在英鎊區域之內。且現在貿易已漸减少，為維持香港之繁榮計，實不該於此加以任何限制」。</p>
<p>該論文內稱：「香港之紙幣有十足的英鎊準備金，再者，戰後香港在倫敦儲有相當數量的存款，故「雖則香港之貿易尚嫌不足，然香港對外國之收支，仍能保持平衡」。</p>
<p>繼稱：「新法令之直接影響，將為香港對硬幣及半硬幣地區之出口减少，此種貿易，過去因硬幣兌換英鎊之匯率較高，故有利可圖。</p>
<p>由於國外定貨，均以美元計算，港埠之進口商仍能獲得其全部之外匯利益，故現在港幣雖仍有相當地位，將來不可避免美元將成為遠東貿易之主要通貨」。</p>
<p>「使香港貿易發展感到危險者，尤以倫敦之限制進口執照命令為甚。該政策顯欲香港向硬幣及半硬幣地區購貨减少，而向英鎊區域之購貨增加」</p>
<p>遠東經濟評論對此事作如下之結論：「香港在此種情况下，是否能發展其貿易，實為一大疑問」。</p>

<p>印度與英國在決賽中相逢，此次已屬第八次，蓋自一九〇八年以來，英印奪覇，已成傳統。此次巴基斯坦滿懷熱望，原擬打破前此八屆成慣，為人所未能，奪得與印度決賽之權利。但天不由人，賽前傾盆大雨，塲地濕滑，使慣在硬地作戰之巴基斯坦壯士，失色不少。上半時雖能勉力保持平手，易邊後，即逐漸被　與低氣壓為伍之英國健兒，取得控制權，先後攻入二球，使巴印決鬥之望，成為賽餅。</p>

<h3>四百米接力抗議成立　美國隊重判冠軍　上訴審判更正名次</h3>

<h3>國際籃球　冷戰結束　明州歐洲籃球錦標賽　蘇聯邀往莫斯科舉行　籃協開會商討德國參加比賽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：蘇聯對國際業餘籃球協會之一冷戰」，已於週二終結。籃協已接獲蘇聯請求一九四九年下屆歐洲籃球錦標賽，在莫斯科舉行之建議。今日以蘇聯英雄貝克關諾夫里夫為首之三不速客，突然降臨，參與現在進行中之籃協大會，使各界人士，為之驚異不止。籃協負責人以此舉為蘇聯體育鐵幕展開之徽象，令人「愉快無已」。</p>
<p>籃協大會當前急務，厥為規則之改革，一般推測，俱意大會可能投票決定是否將沿美國十二年來改進之軌跡，簡化球規。例如，在世運比賽中，每次中籃後，球員須俟裁判員碰球後，始得繼續比賽一點，新規則將改為球入籃後，球員得自界外立即發球，以節省時間。球員替換問題，亦將改為無限制。</p>
<p>關於犯規方面，為使比賽更趨緊湊起見，擬將　規定重加修改。「無不公平　擊之接觸」，將為新規則所容計。所謂不公平撞擊，　指數故意以手或腎部觸及對方球員之舉動。但反身投籃時，與對方球員身體上之接觸，不作犯規輪。規則修改之外，會員憲章，法律問題，財政問題，比賽制度，以及業餘資格問題等等，俱在會議　圍之內。</p>
<p>又傅籃協現正謀使德國能參加國際性之比賽，德國籃球會在整個問題德國未獲解決前，固難望邀得承認，但德國籃球隊參加比賽，大部國家，當亦不致反對。籃協大會明後俱將繼續，預定週五結束。</p>

<h3>倫敦氣侯惡劣　觀眾盛況不減</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦九日電〕繼大雨四日後，接踵而至之不列顚若干年來最兇猛之八月大風雨，本日已代世運會與柏林危機，而成為一般談話主題。此次暴風，昨日曾於東南部沿海一帶，引起相當損失，雖世運會開始三四日後，陰雨綿綿，但英人民與遠道而來之各國觀衆，仍冒雨參觀。世運各國選手，於困難環境下，所作驚人表演，創立十二項新紀錄，與美選手於卅三項比賽中，奪得十七項冠軍，而為羣雄之首。第一週內世運會門票收入，已逾四十萬鎊，猶較柏林世運會總收入卅六萬鎊為多。到達溫布萊運動塲之觀衆，逾六萬人，連同參觀游泳與其他比賽之覜衆，第一週內總計，約達八十萬人。官方預料，參觀所有比賽項目之觀衆，總數可增至百數十萬人。</p>
<h3>豫流亡學生向教部請願　要求改善救濟待遇　分發請書問題未能即時解決　將呈請政院作根妥善處理</h3>

<h3>蕉作工學院之南邊</h3>
<p>— 雷震</p>
<p>茲者焦作工學院以時局影饗，遷校南來吳縣復課，經校當局之積極籌備，不日即行招生。該校原在中州，創辦之初，爰應焦作煤礦之需，並係弒人籌辦，外界人士，不無陌生之感。茲將該院校史先作一概略介紹，以供社會關心人士之參閱。</p>
<p>創辦緣起　民國紀元前一邢三月一日，英商福中公司履行合同，在焦作開辦路礦學堂，民國八年辦專門本科，易名為福中礦務專門學校，民國十二年以適應學制，放為福中礦務大學，至民國廿四年始放稱今名。</p>
<p>原校址在河南焦作。民國廿六年十月倭寇沿平漢綫南下，及至安陽陷敵，局勢危迫，該院乃西遷長安，繼復轉移天水，廿七年秋奉令與國立西北大學工學院及東北大學工學院合併放組為國立西北工學院。</p>
<p>復校經過　民國卅四年十月呈准復校，當於次年假洛陽復課。不意卅六年八月，河朔吿警，洛陽岌岌可危，該校為應變計，復遷鄭州，覓定臨時院址於同年十月即行復課。</p>
<p>該院歷年畢業同學共十五屆，合計三百餘人。抗戰前設立採鑛冶金及土木工程兩學系，畢業學生服務遍及各路鑛，均能一本原有良好校風，忠勸職守，堅苦任事，所在多著成績，頗為社會人士所稱道。</p>
<p>學校現況　在校服務　員廿五人，二年級學生採鑛系一班，冶金系一班，一年級學生採鑛系一班，冶金系一班，共計學生一百五十餘名。</p>
<p>以中原多故，汴垣月前一度　守，鄭州一地形同孤懸，該院乃不得不作再度遝移。刻該院張院長淸漣及敎授李善棠·張景淮等均先後抵達吳縣，勘察校址，俾於下期準時復課。據該院敎授稱：東南各省包括台灣在內，大學及獨立學院不少，然尚無如其鑛冶工程學系之設置；由此觀之，則該院南遷實應地方環境之需要，不惟予有志鑛冶學術之靑年减却遠道負笈之苦；且於建國時期所需斯項人材之培育，與夫東南鑛藏之縝密調查，以為未來開發之張本者，當均有所裨益也。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論「適者」</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>在推　帝制的前一小時，有些人認為違抗皇命直是一件不可思議的事；在推翻了帝制之後的一小時，服從皇命立即成為同樣的不可思議。這些人最反對革命；待革命成功了，他們是最擁護革命的人。這樣的人便是達爾文所謂「善於適應環境的人」，今簡稱之為「適者」。</p>
<p>適者路見不平，決不表示義憤，却很現實，據其觀察所知，弱者總是吃虧，於是立志去做令人不平的事；適者遭了打，不可能生氣，只是艷羨打他的人，決意努力自致於可以合法打人之境。</p>
<p>適者最為知禮守法。凡是胆敢違抗社會禮法，不怕為人們所槍殺的人，不是萬惡的匪徒，便是超人的聖賢，又不然，必是匪徒與聖賢的結合物—革命家。所謂革命，無非是藉匪徒的手段以完成聖賢的使命。</p>
<p>今日有些人是在幹着天怒人怨的事，而其遭遇却像是樹下了什麼豐功偉績一般；有些人安份守己，其遭遇却又像是做了許多天怒人怨的事一般。適者最為機警，有鑒於此，頗知為自己利害打算，何適何從，早巳了然於胸。他知道做匪徒太危險，做聖賢不合算，幹革命更是旣不合算又是危險；他選擇的是一條最實惠，最穩便，最合法，最安全的康莊大道，他成了匪徒與聖賢的另一種結合物—國壽。所謂國　也者，只是藉聖賢的手段以完成匪徒之使命的那一種人，而適者正是最善於使用合法的手段以劫取人家的財物。</p>
<p>適者最看不起拒絕適應環境的那種頑强份子，他見了後者深覺好笑，深覺討厭，深覺不順眼，視之為飯桶，為壽頭，馴至認為簡直是犯了彌天大罪。可是你若以其治人之道還治其人之身，此時適者就立即成為聖賢。</p>
<p>適者最識大體，深信茄子有一定的大小，雞鴨只能在地上行走，桃花必須開放於春天，一旦看見了比普通茄子為大的茄子，難免目之為怪異，自必立即摘了毀掉而後快；看見了雞鴨騰空飛升，先是向之嘲笑，繼而對之呵責，對方如再執迷不悟，他便開槍射擊，聖雄甘地便給射了下來。冬天里的桃花目擊此狀，那里還敢提早開花。而適者畢竟最合時宜，反正他過的日子就永遠是冬大。</p>
<p>在其「從衆」一點看，適者頗有點像庸人，而事實上適者絕非庸庸碌碌的人，却是所謂「聖之時者」。H·L·曼根稱之為「二流人物」，但此輩實在是社會之中堅。惟有拒不加入「適者公曾」的人才是庸庸碌碌的人。今日的世界是二流人物的世界，二流人物的二流才藝目然最為二流世界所賞識。於是在這個公會以外的人便像是仰天躺着的烏龜，難免給二流的呆烏殺了佐餐。</p>
<h3>我所知道的吳清源（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>淸源到日本後，拜在　越憲作門下，時年十五歲，瀨越極喜之，欲與以四段之資格，本因坊則只擬以二段與之，其後由本因坊·岩佐·鈴木·瀨越各七段，加勝·小野田·岩本各六段，共同審查，始正式承認淸源之三段。於此須一述日本棋派及棋院之由來。日本棋有坊門·方圓社兩派，坊門為本因坊秀故之一派，方圓社以廣瀨平洽郎，瀨越憲作一為自領。日本所謂段，如三段與西段之間，其差別只半子之力，七段與八段之間亦然，向來不甚嚴格，三段與四段，實力或完全相等。自坊門·方圓社兩派改組為棋院，以牧野伸顯為總裁，大倉喜七郎為副總裁，院中棋務及審查各段之資格，由本因坊秀哉·鈴木為次郎·瀨越憲作三人決定，始一律從嚴，絲毫不能通融。此次瀨越欲與淸源以四段，並非私意，淸源到東京第一回之手合，為與藤原四段對奕，藤原為日本棋院巾堅之一，而淸源竟得中押勝，司見其實有四段之力。此次到日入棋院，雖被抑為三段，然淸源實能不負其師（　越）提携之意。由昭和三年至十六年，即淸源十五歲至廿七歲，僅僅十三年之間，中間尚有兩年患貧血，未與人對奕一盤，竟能自三段升至八段，非天才不能至此。</p>
<p>翼雲君在「也談吳淸源」文內，言：「以吳淸源之天才，竟為日本羅致以去，極為可慨。」然淸源不到日本，則其棋藝，或至多僅能到五段地步，不能成名為自十第一手。即使中國現有范西屏，淸源與之對奕揣摩，墨守舊法，其成就亦不能盡其天才。蓋中國棋與日本棋道不同，我等觀施（襄夏）范棋譜，幾乎每盤皆有短兵相接之戰塲，日本棋不主張肉搏，自始至終，皆在虛空中取勝，如施范復生，在今日亦必研究日本棋道，不專用舊法也。中國昔日國手有日本棋作風者，只黃龍士一人。</p>
<p>民十二余在北平中央公園春明館見淸源與人下棋，時淸源僅十歲，頭梳兩小辮，下子巳驚人。其後與日人奕，余未得一觀，然余識棋友極多，以上所記，得之於多方面，自信尚為實錄也。</p>
<h3>巧</h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>世界上固然有許多巧合的事，但是如將每一件巧事分析起來，眞正的巧合，所佔的比例，恐怕還是很低的。電影編劇家和小說家為遷就情　曲折而安排的種種巧合，固然為稍具當識者所詬病。即使在新聞或專稿中出現的實事，其巧合之處，也許別有原委。這裏且舉兩個例十來說明。</p>
<p>第一個例子是關於女子頭髮的一種流行式樣。美國某大學女生，嘗至美國貨幣　集家白朗氏主催的貨幣展覽會中去參觀，發現英國東印度公司於一八四〇年鼓籌的一枚羅比上，所彫刻的維多亞女皇的頭髮式樣，與她完全相同，認為天下一大巧事，稱奇不置。殊不知「美國頭髮式樣設計學院」的主持者，曾至白朗處，素取鏤有女人像的硬幣參考，作為設計新式樣的藍本。該大學女生的髮式設計，原是根據貨幣彫刻而來的，並非眞有此巧事也。</p>
<p>另一個例子，則涉及美國的販毒兼殺人犯蘭浦克·布邱爾透。此人作惡多端，美國警察當局追捕甚嚴，迄未弋獲。某日，名聞一時的美國廣播評論家華爾透·溫吉爾從電台巾廣播道：「蘭浦克，你可在收聽廣播嗎？不管你在什麼地方，快些挺身而出！」</p>
<p>結果蘭浦克竟然挺身而出。他在紐約麥哈頓區的一條黑暗的街角上，向華爾透·溫吉爾及聯邦調查局主任埃時加·胡佛自首，轟動全美·夫以一個無權無勇的文化人，而能感召一個匪徒的投案認罪，那裏有此巧事？事後據熟悉內幕者談，蘭浦克的自首，係由號稱為美國第一號的神秘人物下級社會魁首考斯脫勞的拍胸祖保無事所致，因為當局對考斯脫勞施以壓力，迫令他將蘭浦克交出，否則將對他不利。至於蘭浦克適在溫吉爾廣播後投案，僅是故佈疑陣罷了。後來蘭浦克被判電刑，臨刑時大聲哭喊，痛　考斯脫勞賣友不巳。</p>
<p>肇者多看了類似這一類的記載，對於世上的許多巧事，如有人在商店購物贈獎巾，摸中頭獎；或是國外什麼比賽中某名手始終能保持首座等，不免發生懷疑之感，也許由於年齡的關係，對於世故人情，又有較深入一步的看法了。</p>
<h3>巨鐟</h3>
<p>這是加拿大地質學家威廉遜博士一九四一年在非洲發現的粉紅色巨鑽，重達五十四克拉。英國伊麗莎白公主大婚時，威氏就奉獻此鑽，作為婚禮。最近經三個月的琢磨後，它已經成為世界上最大最晶瑩的鑽石，凈重二三·六克拉。本年五月，這顆鑽第一次在倫敦公開展覽。圖為琢磨尚未竣工時所攝之影，英國新聞處贈。</p>
<h3>七夕漫談</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>光陰荏苒，又是乞巧佳節。杜牧秋夕詩：「銀燭秋光冷畫屏，輕羅小扇撲流螢：天階夜色凉如水，臥看牽牛織女星」。膾炙人口，李叔同以入新譜，遂更不朽。</p>
<p>白香山詠七夕詩云：「烟霄微月　長空，銀漢秋期萬古同，幾許歡情與離恨？年年並在此宵中。」</p>
<p>孟東野有古意詩云：「河邊織女星，河畔牽牛郎，未得渡淸淺，相對遙相望。」固別有諷譏也。</p>
<p>七夕旣為雙星相會之佳期，離人騷士，特感傷懷，如孟浩然他鄉七夕詩云；「他鄉逢七夕，旅館益覉愁，不見穿針婦，空懷故國樓。緒風初减熱，新月始臨秋，誰忍窺河漢？迢迢望斗牛。」七月朔日，市上即有賣「巧果」者，於七夕禮拜雙星以乞巧。七日前夕，以杯盛鴛鴦水，掬和露庭中，天明日出曬之，徐俟水膜生面，各拈小鍼，投水使浮，因視水底針影之所似，以騐智魯。</p>
<p>荊楚歲時記云：七月七夕，人家婦女結綵縷穿七孔鍼，陳瓜果於庭中，以乞巧，有喜子網於瓜上，則以為符應。</p>
<p>致虛閣雜俎云：七夕，徐婕妤雕鏤菱藕作奇花異烏，攢於水晶盤中以進上，極其精巧，上大稱許，賜以珍寳無數。上對之竟日，喜不可言，至定昏時，上自散置宮中几上，令宮人暗中摸取，以多寡精羅為勝負，謂之鬥巧，以為歡笑。薛瑤英於七月八日，令諸婢共剪輕綵，作連理花千餘　，以陽起石染之，當午散於庭中，隨風而上，徧空中如五色雲霞，久之方沒，謂之渡河吉慶花，藉以乞巧。</p>
<p>粵人婦女乞巧，每在六日晚上行之，燃香燭，齋瓜果之外，並有紙糊之「七夕盆」一種，為其他各地所無者，滬上各廣東難貨鋪有售。</p>
<p>潮汕人乞巧，則於七日上午祀床公床婆，燃香燭於床上，獨不行之晚間，是亦一種風俗也。</p>
<h3>凌雲臺</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>營造法式，千年前建築術專著也，中有材料重量表，如云，諸石每一立方寸重二兩三錢，必指恒用之石材數種，非調凡石等重。又云，白松木每一立方寸重三錢二分，是則可信。昔魏文帝築凌雲臺，自樓棟至地十三丈五尺七寸五分，世說新語記其事云，「凌雲臺樓觀精巧，先稱平衆木輕重，然後造構，乃無錙銖相負，揭臺難高峻，常隨風搖動，而終無傾倒之理。魏明帝登臺，　其勢危，別以大木材扶持之，樓即頹壞，論者謂輕重力偏故也。」人言高樓因風動搖者必為良構，居之者心安，其同時不搖者，遇更烈之風，多不可保云。凌雲臺上之樓，其本身當不甚高，木材所建，終不可久。佛塔累甄石而成，其壽較長，今上海龍華寺塔徵見傾斜，仍無倒塌之勢。杭州雷峯塔雖剝落，設無盜甄者，當至今矗立。紂為旋室傾宮，其狀若何，無得而言矣。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>極慘烈之「毀滅武器」，卻又有個極美善的名兒，謂之「和平武器」。作此理想者，早有其人。無綫電成功者之義大利馬可尼，即曾想到幾種「消滅戰爭的武器」，美人海斯約翰亦曾說「武器愈烈，則畏戰者愈衆，可以保障和平。」此等說法，頗似中國先哲所謂「建威銷萌」，「辟以止辟」，「止戈為武」，亦非全無理由。</p>
<p>馬可尼所想到的：（一）是毀滅鏡，製一絕大凸鏡，聚日光於一點，以此一點之熱，映射敵軍，使其百萬大軍立成灰燼，大艦重砲，頓成　汁，堅壁硬壘，化為焦土。（此法或從凸面鏡片向日光取火吸香烟悟出。）（二）無綫電通過敵陣，令其顫震不支，癱瘓就斃。（三）恐怖色，惑亂對方之感情，不戰自亂。（比失街亭劇之斷絕水道如何？）（四）是恐怖光綫，映射敵軍，令震驚紛擾，亦是「不戰自亂」，而且「不打自僵。（封神演義之金光聖母無以過焉。）以上種種，只是「想」，沒有「做」，更沒有成功的「器」，更沒有「軍事試騐」。馬可尼大約因為無綫電的奇效，太高興了，所以犬做其「發明之夢」。海斯的話，卻非虛說。他曾製過一種高熱彈，比德國之砲彈能攻堅而不能蔓延鎔燒者厲害多多。當一九四五年春間，美軍艦迫近日本沿海，以大砲向岸上排擊，起火時，日本之救火隊前往搶救，立時同斃，即此類之砲彈，然終不及原子彈事半功倍。</p>
<p>說「毀滅武器」是一和平武器」，固不免誇大其詞，惟當二次大戰之末期，日軍聚百萬陸軍精銳，死守本土，計劃巳見實施，在當時所謂「困獸猶鬬」，亦是可能之事實。羅斯福預計之最後占領日土，在一九四六之夏季，若非原十彈之嚴重警吿，則戰事延長半年，兩方犧牲之倍數可想而知。故此兩彈已有縮短戰禍之效果。</p>
<p>至於今後之「原子」戰爭能否藉「原子」武器之進步與鎭壓，而使量力知難者有所忌憚，克保和平，則似無人能於此時知其必然。</p>

<h3>Actively Reforming the Currency System; Loan Negotiations with the US Still Underway; New Economic Plan to Be Discussed by Executive Yuan Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It has just been learned from a fairly reliable source that the total amount of the currency reform loan proposed by our country to the United States is US$600 million, of which US$200 million is to be used to withdraw legal tender, and the other US$400 million is to be used as a fund for the new currency. Negotiations for this currency reform loan began when Bei Zuyi went to the United States and are still ongoing. During his previous return from the United States, Mr. Bei Zuyi made a report on the negotiations. It is widely believed that Li Gan's return this time will also provide a very detailed report. The United States hopes that China will first stabilize its economic situation and must engage in fiscal and economic reforms. It is also hoped that this US aid can be used properly. As for the recent rumors that the currency system is about to be reformed and that Sun Yat-sen currency has already been printed, relevant people here believe that it is still too early to say. Before adequate preparations for currency reform are made, the authorities still do not dare to act rashly on currency reform, but preparations for reform are now being carried out more actively. The new economic plan that will be implemented soon can also be regarded as one of the preparatory tasks for currency reform. [Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Executive Yuan's regular meeting will be held on the 11th. The new economic plan drafted by President Weng has not yet been revealed to the outside world as of the 10th. However, it is widely believed that it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion on the 11th so that it can be promulgated to all ministries and commissions for implementation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Li Gan, a member of the Chinese technical delegation to the United States, came to Nanjing to attend the US Aid Utilization Committee, and successively met with President Weng, Foreign Minister Wang, etc., to report on the loan negotiations in the United States, the procedures for US aid utilization, and technical issues. Having completed his public duties, he returned to Shanghai by military plane on the night of the 10th and will come to Nanjing again by train on the night of the 12th to attend the joint meeting of the US Aid Committee and the China branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank has decided to establish a special account to store the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials and is negotiating with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Municipal Bank to conclude a contract under which the entrusted banks will collect the funds and submit them to the Central Bank. According to a recent strong criticism in the Nanjing Central Daily News of the three banks vying to handle the proceeds of US aid, it was argued that profiting as intermediaries would undermine the effect of US aid in stabilizing prices. However, responsible persons at the Bank of China believe that the funds handled by them are loans of a national policy nature undertaken by order, with interest of only 1.3%, which is only enough to cover expenses. Moreover, the Central Bank can declare the contract invalid at any time if it believes there is no need for it.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction; Both Chinese and American Members Determined; Jiang Menglin Appoints Yan Yangchu as Director-General</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The list of the five members of the Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee has been decided and is recorded as follows: American members are Bi Fanyu and Moye; Chinese members are Jiang Menglin, Jiang Tingfu, and Shen Zonghan. Jiang Menglin is the chairman, and Yan Yangchu is the director-general. The appointments of the members will be announced separately by the presidents of China and the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] According to sources, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization will cooperate closely with the recently established Agricultural Reconstruction Joint Committee on technical matters. According to a person in charge of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, theoretically, the organization has nothing to do with the Agricultural Reconstruction Joint Committee. The former is an international organization, and the latter is composed of China and the United States. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization is very willing to cooperate with the committee on technical matters and is willing to provide all advisory assistance. He continued that in the past, the Food and Agriculture Organization had assisted the China Relief Mission in completing 53 agricultural reconstruction projects, such as the tree planting in Baguazhou and Tangshan near Nanjing. The Agricultural Reconstruction Joint Committee was established last Thursday and has five members (three Chinese and two Americans).</p>
<h3>Handling Three Types of Materials; Zhang Lisheng Presides</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Regarding the handling of enemy and puppet materials, US military surplus materials, and Japanese reparations materials, the Executive Yuan has decided that Vice President Zhang Lisheng will be responsible for presiding over the matter. According to Mr. Zhang, it is hoped that the handling of these materials can be sorted out within two months. After all three types of materials are sold, it will increase the national treasury income by approximately US$300 million. This is because the total value of US military surplus materials alone is approximately US$500 million, of which one-third has not yet been processed.</p>
<h3>Interbank Lending Measures; Ministry of Finance Orders Abolition</h3>
<p>Strictly Regulate Financial Business</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] In order to strengthen control over finance, the Ministry of Finance has reiterated its previous order regarding the "Measures to Strengthen the Regulation of Financial Business" promulgated by the Executive Yuan and strictly enforced it. It also issued an order to all provincial and municipal banks to abolish the six articles of the "Interbank Lending" measures promulgated by the Ministry, and provincial banks shall no longer handle interbank lending business.</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Increase the Quantity of Goods Purchased in China</h3>

It has also received a letter from the British Ministry of Commerce stating that it is very pleased that China can increase its exports of oil to Britain.

<h3>Flights to Zhengzhou Resume from Nanjing, Shanghai, Pinghan, etc.</h3>
<p>Limited to Letters and Postcards</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Jiangsu Postal Administration News: Flights to Zheng County from Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Hankou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, etc. have now resumed. However, the schedule is sparse, and the tonnage for transporting mail is limited. The carriage of mail is temporarily limited to letters and postcards.

Letters and postcards sent by the public to Bian and Zheng and other places through which they transit will still be sent by air.</p>
<h3>US Vice Consul Bach Returns to His Country to Report; Passes Through Shanghai and Talks About the Situation in Dalian; Little Improvement in the Economy, Unemployment Continues to Increase; Freedom of Movement of Chinese and Foreigners Strictly Restricted</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The US Vice Consul in Dalian, Mr. Bach, left Dalian by boat on the 22nd of last month to return to his country to report on his duties. He passed through Shanghai and held a press conference at the US Consulate General yesterday afternoon to report on the recent situation in Dalian. Most of the attendees were American reporters, who asked in detail about the activities of the Soviet Union in Dalian, which shows the US concern about the situation in the Northeast. According to Mr. Bach, "In my judgment, there has been little improvement in the economic situation in the past three years. The lack of raw materials and important equipment has led to a continuous increase in high prices and widespread unemployment.</p>
<p>The actions and autonomy of both Chinese and foreigners are strictly restricted. Every Chinese family must hold a registration book issued by the police station, which records the movements of each family member from one city or town to another. If a member of the family wants to stay overnight outside the home, they must register. In the past six months, stricter controls have been placed on Chinese people who want to leave the Dalian area. In the summer and autumn of 1947, many Chinese people managed to leave. At that time, permits were not difficult to obtain, but since then, the control situation has become increasingly strict, and now immigration permits can only be obtained from the Kwantung Police Station, and the procedures for obtaining them are extremely troublesome. At present, Chinese people who are allowed to leave Dalian are only temporarily allowed to go to the phosphorus mining area on sand boats. The purpose is obviously to collect goods from China.</p>
<p>Similar restrictions are also imposed on foreign residents. At present, the foreign residential area is actually limited to Soviet citizens and personnel of the US Consulate. Although I have consular powers, I am only allowed to go to the port area when American diplomatic mail arrives. Obstacles placed at important strongholds on the highway greatly restrict travel in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The social forces implemented by the current administrative authorities make it impossible for Chinese citizens to develop friendships or contacts with the small number of foreigners residing in the area."</p>
<p>Mr. Bach also revealed that there are approximately 10,000 Soviet nationals in the city, including the military. The navy only has submarines and destroyers stationed there, but there are many merchant ships. The commander of the garrison is Colonel Lai Fashijin, who holds local power and is subject to the control of Commander Baolotelov of the Lushun naval base. The mayor appointed by the Chinese Communist Party can only ask about civil affairs.</p>
<h3>Bangkok Gold Heist; Part of the Loot Shipped to Macau; Reward for Informant Exceeds US$80,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 10th] It is reported that a shocking gold heist occurred here on May 12. Part of the loot, totaling 22 boxes, was discovered by the police and transported to Macau by plane yesterday morning. This gold shipment was escorted by a large number of police officers and representatives of the manager. According to previous reports, the Asian Airlines Catalina aircraft from Iran transported this batch of gold worth 24 million shields to Macau, and the total reward given to the informant exceeded US$86,000.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Central Hubei Flee to Xing Mountain; Defense of Yichang Strengthened; Number of Upstream and Downstream Ship Voyages Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 10th] After a band of communist bandits infiltrated Dangyang in central Hubei, another band fled through Yuan'an towards Xingshan.

In addition, the number of upstream and downstream ship voyages in Yichang has gradually decreased in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] (Late Arrival) The situation in western Hubei has become tense. Approximately 6,000 to 7,000 bandits fleeing south from the Nanzhang area in northern Hubei merged with a band of scattered bandits entrenched in the northwest of Jingmen on the 7th. On the 8th, they took advantage of the situation to infiltrate Yuan'an, and then continued to attack Dangyang fiercely. On the morning of the 9th, for strategic reasons, the National Army automatically withdrew from Dangyang after the communist army paid a considerable price. Although the outer perimeter of Yichang and Shashi is tense, the National Army has already made strict preparations by land and sea.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] The shipping industry received an urgent telegram from Yichang on the 10th stating that the bandits who infiltrated Dangyang continued to flee southwest, 40 li away from Yichang. The situation in Yichang is becoming increasingly tense, and the families of the shipping industry have all left Yichang for Chongqing.</p>
<p>Also, shipping between Yichang and Shashi is still open on the 10th</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The communist Jianghan Independent Brigade has fled southwest from Maliangpingxi's Jieshan to Wanlonggang. According to a telegram from the 21st Pacification Zone in Yichang, the bandits continue to flee west in separate groups, attempting to cut off traffic on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The National Army is blocking and attacking them.</p>
<p>Also, the bandit Li Bingnan's band of more than a thousand fled south from the Liuhouji area in the southern border of Nanzhang to Chenjiachong, attempting to threaten Jingmen.</p>
<h3>Jinan is as Peaceful as Usual; National Army Closely Deployed</h3>

The bandits in the Zhanghong Difangqiao area south of Fuxian are now being searched and suppressed by the teams and have been broken up into smaller groups.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The summer harvest in the Guanzhong Plain has been completed. It is generally expected that the communist bandits, who have been entrenched in the barren mountainous areas of northern Shaanxi for a long time, may come down the mountains to seize grain recently. However, the National Army has already made strict preparations, and if the bandits attempt to nibble away at the area, they will be severely hit.</p>
<h3>Yangtai Counties in Northern Jiangsu Decide to Establish Joint Defense Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 10th] Communist bandits in the Yangtai area of northern Jiangsu appear frequently on the borders of the two counties, acting as a corridor for fleeing north and south and hindering land and water transportation between Yangtai. It is learned that the authorities of the two counties have decided to form a joint defense organization, with Jiegou, Baituohe, and Guangfuqiao as the joint defense zone, and station troops there regularly to crack down on the communist bandits' attempts to flee.</p>
<h3>Communist Suluyu Military Region; Brigade-Level Deputy Chief of Staff; Fan Zhonghua Defects</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The communist bandit Fan Zhonghua, deputy chief of staff at the brigade level of the Suluyuwan Military Region, witnessed the communist bandits' madness and devastation of the country and people and was heartbroken. He specially led more than 2,000 men, carrying 20 light and heavy machine guns, 25 pistols, more than 1,300 rifles, 60 grenade launchers, 32 mules and horses, and two rubber-wheeled military vehicles, to defect to the National Army. He also sent a telegram to the President, stating the details of the defection.</p>

<h3>Democracy Needs Moral Support; Overcoming the Crisis Lies in Reform; Chen Lifu's Speech in Caux, Switzerland</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Caux, Switzerland, 9th] Our Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Lifu, delivered a speech today to 750 representatives from 25 countries attending the European Moral Rearmament Conference, saying, "Caux is the starting point for transforming the world." Mr. Chen inspected democratic systems in the United States and Western Europe for approximately two months. This time, he participated in the European Moral Rearmament Conference as a guest of Mr. Buchman, the founder of the World Moral Rearmament Movement. He said, "In the past four weeks, I have held talks with politicians from democratic countries on both sides of the Atlantic. I have met with US President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, Canadian Prime Minister King, British Prime Minister Attlee, Foreign Secretary Bevin, Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, French Prime Minister Marie, and Foreign Minister Schumann. One of the purposes is to prove to them the effectiveness of the Moral Rearmament ideology. The world is now facing a major crisis, and evil ideas are trying to control every country. China has been fighting for years against forces that threaten and destroy our national culture." He continued, "Caux is giving the world a new power of higher ideas, a power that can sweep away all lesser ideas and lead to the perfection of the concept of human personality and national destiny. The first step is reform, which in my experience is possible. I must start with my own reform, and China must also start with its own reform." Mr. Chen concluded, "Democracy must be supported by another kind of power. Democracy without a moral foundation is equal to an empty shell. Moral Rearmament is the inspiring democratic center. We must first live according to this idea and then extend it to the country." Mr. Chen was accompanied by his wife and secretary Luo Shishi. Mr. Chen stayed in Switzerland and was entertained by our Ambassador Wu Nanru.</p>

After arriving in Guling on the evening of the 9th, the President walked for more than ten minutes on Hedong Road and Hexi Road near his official residence at about 9:00 pm. He did not go out during the day on the 10th. At 12:00 noon, he summoned Wang Zuomin, director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, and Liu Song, director of the farm, to give instructions on afforestation matters. From the President's official residence, one can see the barren mountains under the Guniuling Observation Station. When the President visited Guling last summer, he instructed the former Director Wu Shih-Han to plant trees. This time he came to Guling and looked at the area from afar, and the trees were still not planted, so he summoned Wang Liu and others to give instructions. Chairman Hu Jiafeng of Jiangxi Province greeted the President at Shilipu on the 9th and accompanied him up the mountain. At 5:00 pm on the 10th, he was summoned to meet with the President, who inquired about the provincial administration and flood situation in Jiangxi, and was deeply concerned about the people affected by the disaster. In addition to reporting on the disaster situation in various places, Mr. Hu also asked the President to approve loans for water conservancy and disaster relief in Jiangxi Province, which the President also agreed to. Mr. Hu left at 5:30. At that time, the sun was setting in the west, and the President and his wife walked out of their official residence at about 6:00 pm and went to the Lushan Library along Hedong Road for a long time. They did not return to their official residence until 7:00 pm. It is reported that some of the President's entourage will arrive in Xun by riverboat on the 11th and 12th and transfer to Guling, and Mr. Chen Bulei and Mr. Chen Fang will also come to Guling.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Turbulent Situation in Tibet</h3>
<p>Due to the visit of the Tibetan trade delegation to the United States, people in the country have begun to pay attention to the Tibetan issue again. Our Chongqing dispatch on the 8th: Relevant parties received a telegram from Tibet on the 7th stating that Sera Monastery, which was shelled and destroyed by the current Regent Rongzeng Daza last April, and Reting Ranhuh, who was murdered, united with Drepung Monastery to raise the flag against Rongzeng because they were unwilling to endure prolonged oppression. The momentum is huge, and Rongzeng is unable to cope, and it is rumored that he intends to resign and apologize. In addition, on the west bank of the Jinsha River, the Tibetan army stationed in Kang is frequently mobilized, and there seem to be military actions. Judging from the turbulent situation in Tibet over the past year, another coup in Tibet is possible. Whether Rongzeng resigns is particularly closely related to the relationship between China and Tibet, so we have to pay close attention to the development and impact of the Tibetan coup.</p>
<p>The political system in Tibet is relatively special, and its political and religious power has always been in the hands of the Dalai Lama. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933, the three major monasteries of Sera, Drepung, and Ganden (also known as Gongdeling, Cedeling, and Xideling) jointly elected Reting, one of the four Hutuktu, as the Regent to control all the political and religious power in Tibet. Reting was young and promising, and had progressive ideas. Since taking office, he has eliminated corruption and clarified politics internally, which has won the love of the people; externally, he reversed the Dalai Lama's policy of "being pro-British and anti-Han," stopped internal incursions into Qingkang, and tried to get close to the central government, sympathizing with the motherland's war of resistance against Japan, and repeatedly praying for the victory of the war of resistance and the dead soldiers and civilians. In 1938, the reincarnated 14th Dalai Lama, Lhamo Dhondup, was found near Xining in Qinghai, and was escorted to Tibet with the assistance of the central government. For a time, the relationship between China and Tibet was harmonious, breaking the record since the Republic of China. However, Reting was therefore envied by the pro-British faction, which laid the seeds of disaster; at the same time, the central government also missed the opportunity to win over Tibet's true submission, causing Reting to be unable to support himself and be plotted against, leading to the deterioration of the overall situation in Tibet.</p>
<p>The Reting incident occurred last April. The reason for the incident was that the pro-British faction used the excuse that Reting's astrological signs were unclear in 1942 and persuaded him to retire to avoid disaster. Reting was short of external assistance and was coerced internally at the time, so he handed over the position of Regent to his teacher Rongzeng Daza to act on his behalf, stating that it would be returned after two years. Unexpectedly, Rongzeng, wanting power and wealth, thoroughly eliminated Reting's power after acting as Regent, and arrested Reting and put him in prison on April 14 last year, and poisoned him to death on May 7, exposing his body in the streets of Lhasa. When Reting was arrested, 5,000 lamas from Sera Monastery demanded his release. Rongzeng not only did not accept it, but also sent two regiments of troops to surround Sera. After a bloody battle, Sera Monastery was destroyed, most of the monks died, and a small number fled Lhasa. This incident shows the rise of the "pro-British and anti-Han" forces, and the conspiracy to carry out Tibetan independence.</p>
<p>The situation in Tibet has been turbulent in recent years, especially after India's independence, the situation in Tibet has deteriorated, which is the evil consequence of Reting's death. The construction of the India-Tibet highway, bordering the Kangqing border, obviously has an international background. The Tibetan army's deployment of troops on the Qingkang border, drinking on the Jinsha River, obviously has the intention of internal invasion. The trade delegation's flight to the United States to conduct trade with the United States, obviously wants to establish diplomatic or commercial relations with the United States alone. Rongzeng Daza, as Regent, is responsible for this kind of centrifugal intention. He represents the ambitions of a minority of people in Tibet, and plots to betray the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, which is naturally opposed by the majority of people in Tibet. In particular, the three major monasteries, the center of religious legal power in Tibet, have pure thoughts and love China. They seek revenge for Reting and build peace for Tibet. They will not tolerate Rongzeng's greedy ambitions. Based on this situation, we believe that a new coup in Tibet is very possible, and the movement to overthrow Dongzeng is an inevitable trend. The three major monasteries in Tibet are the beacon of thought for the people of Tibet. They consciously rise up to overthrow tyranny. If their revolution is successful this time, it will be said that the future of Tibet is bright. The current gloomy atmosphere will surely be swept away, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Finally, we would also like to specifically point out that the border defense of Tibet concerns the safety of Central Asia and several provinces of our country. Especially in today's complex international disputes, the government should pay close attention to the changing situation in the Pamirs and the Himalayas; and should further seek good countermeasures to win over the border minorities, or assist the border people in reforming the status quo, improve their living standards, so that they can reach the realm of true local autonomy, and complete the establishment of an integrated national family and a national state.</p>
<h3>I Order Rayon from Italy, Worth Approximately US$2 Million, Part of Which is Imported by Barter</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Information from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce 1: The import of rayon is mainly from Italy, and the amount from other countries is extremely small. If rayon importers are separately entrusted to handle it, it may delay the time and fail to meet the urgent needs of the country. Moreover, ordering from various countries would complicate the patterns and the quality would be inconsistent, making it difficult to distribute the entire quota. In view of this, the Central Trust Bureau ordered Italian rayon worth US$2 million from Italy, but in order to save foreign exchange, part of it was imported by barter. It is said that a barter contract has been signed directly with the Italian side. In this barter contract, in addition to rayon being imported from Italy, China exports tung oil, tea oil, sesame seed oil, rapeseed oil, castor oil, peanuts, sesame, soybeans, sunflower seeds, feeding beans, various seed cakes, camel hair and wool, tungsten (65% content), ramie, 　ramie, cottonseed oil, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Information from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Regarding the operation of rayon factories, China's industrial circles are now beginning to plan and establish them, but no rayon factory has been completed and started operation. Recently, two manufacturers have submitted plans to the Ministry requesting rewards for establishing rayon factories. One is Anle Textile Company, which claims that it is using the latest foreign methods to manufacture, and 80% of the factory equipment has been completed. The remaining 20% of the parts are being purchased from the United States and will arrive soon. Once assembled, it can start production. The other is Zhongyuan Paper Mill, which claims that it has purchased a factory from the United States that can produce two and a half tons of rayon per day, and all of it will arrive soon. As for the recent rumors that Jiangnan Enterprise Company in Shanghai intends to cooperate with American businessmen to establish a rayon factory with a daily output of two and a half tons, and whether Zhongfang Company will participate, the Ministry has not heard of it.</p>

<h3>Kunming Changes Method of Levying Special Donations, Military and Political Leaders and Celebrities Make Donations According to Their Conscience</h3>
<p>Various Trade Associations Designate Donations</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 10th] Kunming's special donation for disaster relief has been fraught with twists and turns. The list of wealthy people who refused to donate was previously submitted, but the parties concerned believed that it was unfair and have filed written protests. The work of soliciting donations has also been hindered as a result. It has now been decided that military and political leaders and social celebrities will adopt a method of free donations, that is, after investigating their property, the donation book will be sent to them, and each person will donate according to their conscience. Other trade associations will designate donations. The total amount of special donations for disaster relief in Yunnan and Guizhou is set at 600 billion yuan. Kunming and Zhuzhou will each contribute 250 billion yuan. Gejiu District will contribute 65 billion yuan, and Tengchong District will contribute 35 billion yuan. However, it is felt that the donation amount is too large, and a request will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for a reduction.</p>
<h3>Japan Returns Materials to China Worth Over 10 Million US Dollars, Those Already Shipped Back to China are Worth 3 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Wu Bannong, head of our reparations and restitution representative in Japan, stated that the materials looted from China by Japan during the war and returned to our country are worth a total of US$13.65 million, but items that cannot be valued are not included. Of the above-mentioned materials, those already shipped back to China are worth approximately US$3 million, and the rest are waiting to be shipped. Wu stated that since the establishment of the Restitution Advisory Committee in April, the restitution work has made great progress, but because Chinese people either do not understand how to file restitution claims or the evidence is insufficient even if they file restitution claims, the materials that have been obtained are still far from the expected goals.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] According to an official announcement this afternoon, China and the Netherlands are the first two countries to receive Japanese electrical equipment materials in the 30% advance reparations. China has received a 6,250 kW generator and its equipment. This generator was dismantled from a naval arsenal in Sendai. The Netherlands has also obtained a smaller 3,250 kW generator from the same factory. The generator obtained by China was manufactured in 1931, and the one obtained by the Netherlands was manufactured in 1926. It is said that both generators are in good condition. The United Kingdom and the Philippines will wait to receive other equipment later. So far, the advance reparations obtained by the above four countries are only machine tools and minor metals and laboratory equipment.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Allocates Special Donation Quotas</h3>

<h3>Japanese Looted Goods are Unclaimed, I Have Priority to Purchase, Far Eastern Commission Announces New Restitution Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] The Far Eastern Commission today issued a new policy on the return of goods looted by Japan during the war, and gave China priority to purchase goods that are unclaimed. This new directive has been submitted to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) and has been notified by the United States to all regions previously occupied by Japan but without representatives on the Far Eastern Commission. After the issuance of this order, the Far Eastern Commission's previous restitution directives and the US directive on the disposition of captured Japanese ships have been repealed. The new directive requires the immediate return of assets and ships identified by various countries to the Allied countries, regardless of whether the Japanese had paid any price for these assets through deception, coercion or threats. At the same time, it also asks member states to give the requesting countries the right of doubt under the final principle of generosity. Japan will repair the returned ships as a priority so that these ships are restored to the condition they were in when they were looted. The issue of the return of industrial and transportation machinery and equipment is different. If SCAP believes that such machinery and equipment are necessary for the security of the occupying forces, the return can be delayed, but the procedures for requesting the return of such items should not delay the dismantling and transportation of reparations. Until the authorities have made a decision on any request, the item cannot be designated for use as reparations. Requests for the return of items that have been used for compensation and have been delivered will not be considered. The cost of dismantling, packaging and transporting the returned items to the agreed location will be borne by Japan. The new directive also stipulates that Japanese cultural items and other items that SCAP believes should be returned are prohibited from export. Gold, banknotes and other precious metals and treasures that no country has identified so far will be liquidated in the future. China, Australia, France, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom will have priority to purchase in turn. Each country will purchase according to the proportion of reparations allocated based on the foreign exchange accepted by SCAP, and the proceeds will be incorporated into the fund managed by the Allied Powers or other organizations that will succeed SCAP to serve as the basis for credit needed for occupation work, but the entire fund will be distributed to the countries receiving reparations no later than October 1, 1949. The Far Eastern Commission recommends that countries requesting restitution and the countries where the items they are requesting may be located establish bilateral arrangements. The Commission also ordered SCAP to establish an agency to advise the Far Eastern Commission on restitution issues. The agency will be composed of one representative from each of the eleven member states' restitution and reparations groups in Japan.</p>

<h3>Wei River in Northern Shandong Floods, Dezhou and Leling Inundated</h3>

<h3>Taiwan's Request for Fertilizer Allocation Resolved, Payment to be Offset by Taiwan's Local Products, Director of Food Bureau Returns to Taipei from Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 9th] Taiwan's Director of the Food Bureau, Li Lianchun, recently went to Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Bank, the Ministry of Food, and the US Aid Utilization Committee regarding the purchase of fertilizer and the supply of food. He has now returned to Taiwan after completing his mission. He told reporters today that the goals of this trip have been largely achieved. First, the Central Bank has agreed to allocate 84,000 tons of fertilizer, some of which has already been shipped to Taiwan, and the rest will arrive in December. However, the payment will be offset by rice, tea, camphor, and pineapple produced in the province. Second, since this amount of fertilizer is not enough for distribution, the Ministry of Food was requested to allocate 15,000 tons of soybean cake, which was also agreed to under the principle of barter. In the future, the supply and demand of fertilizer in the province in the second phase of the 37th year and the first phase of the 38th year will not be in a state of panic. Third, since US aid includes 70 million US dollars designated for food, it was suggested that the US Aid Utilization Committee could use part of it to purchase fertilizer and supply it to Taiwan, so that the province could exchange a large amount of food, and it would not be necessary to purchase foreign rice from Saigon and other places, so that US aid could cooperate with self-reliance. The central government has now agreed to consider it. Li is a native of Fujian, and this is his first time visiting the mainland. He described his impressions, saying: The mainland is fertile for thousands of miles, with boundless green fields, and is truly a country rich in natural resources, but it lacks utilization. Shanghai is more prosperous than imagined, but there are fewer producers and more consumers. By extension, the urgent task at hand is to strengthen economic management, which cannot be delayed.</p>

Recently, the business section of the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department summoned both parties to Shanghai for mediation, fulfilling a mediated settlement for joint cooperation, and verbally instructed the "Xi" faction workers to resume work soon. Thus, the "Xi" faction workers arrived at the station at 6:00 AM on the 10th to prepare for work. Prior to this, military police and other agencies had received secret reports stating that a large-scale armed conflict was about to occur, and dispatched a large number of military police to monitor the vicinity of the railway. Simultaneously, the command post invited the heads of various agencies and representatives from both sides to mediate, awaiting a resolution within three days. Around 2:00 PM, the "Ke" faction workers suddenly arrived at the station to work, leading to a brawl, with weapons including yellow stones, knives, clubs, and lime bags used. The situation was quite serious for a time, but it was dispersed after suppression by the military police. As a result, eleven members of the "Xi" faction, including Xue Sanjiu, were injured, as well as five members of the "Ke" faction. The authorities are currently mediating. At the same time, the nearby Xinyufeng Sauce Garden was also damaged by stray stones, destroying oil and sauce vats and causing losses of approximately ten yi. A shop assistant, Ni Dechang, was also injured. It is also reported that Zhang Genlin, a worker from the "Xi" faction, is missing, and his fate is unknown.</p>

<h3>No Progress in Kremlin Talks: Soviet Union Proposes Counter-Proposal; Lifting Berlin Blockade Comes with Conditions</h3>
<p>[Report from our news agency] London, 10th: According to well-informed White House sources, negotiations between the East and West in the Kremlin remain stalled on how to achieve a quick resolution to the Berlin crisis. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his third meeting with the British, American, and French envoys on the 9th, presented a Soviet plan for resolving the Berlin currency issue, and stated that if the British, Americans, and French could accept the plan, the Berlin blockade could be lifted.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] It has come to light that Stalin will personally approve any overall resolution after the Western envoys and Molotov have agreed on the important details. Observers believe that after US Ambassador Smith and his British and French colleagues finish talking with Molotov, they will meet with Stalin again. The results of the three-hour conversation on the night of the 9th remain strictly confidential. Before reporting to their respective governments, the three envoys conferred at the British Embassy for an hour. It is generally expected that they will meet with senior Soviet officials again as soon as they receive instructions from their governments. If Stalin and the Western governments approve the agreement, the foreign ministers' meeting will only be a formality. However, at present, apart from the length of the negotiations, there is no indication that a complete agreement has been reached. The talks may be limited to the conditions for the foreign ministers' meeting, but it is possible that a complete agreement may be reached in Moscow before the four foreign ministers meet in Paris next month.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] According to reliable sources: The talks between the three Western special envoys stationed in Moscow and Molotov are expected to obtain understanding, cancel the Berlin blockade, and hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting. The current talks aim to reach an understanding in order to achieve the following goals: (1) Cancel the Berlin blockade; (2) Allow Soviet currency to circulate throughout Berlin under conditions acceptable to the four powers; (3) Postpone the meeting between the Supreme Commander of the Western European Allied Forces and the premiers of the West German states, scheduled for September. The source also briefly described the outline of the Moscow negotiations as follows: During the first audience of the three special envoys with Stalin and Molotov, they studied (1) the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade, offering exchange conditions, allowing Soviet currency to circulate throughout Berlin; (3) convening a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the entire German problem. On Friday, the Western representatives met with Molotov and delivered a memorandum, briefly stating the attitudes of their respective governments after the first meeting with Stalin and Molotov. The memorandum did not mention that the Western three powers accepted the postponement of the implementation of the London agreement on the West German issue, but it did mention that at least the meeting between the Supreme Commander of the Western Allied Forces and the premiers of the West German states could be expected to be postponed. It was said that Molotov stated at the time that allowing the four powers to control the issuance of Soviet currency in Berlin would be tantamount to granting the Western three powers the power to control Berlin's economic life, which would undermine the Soviet Union's position. During the third meeting today, Molotov was said to have proposed a counter-proposal, wanting to completely control the currency circulating in Berlin by the Soviet Union, and wanting to postpone the implementation of the London agreement on West Germany. The Western three special envoys discussed the Soviet Union's counter-proposal in detail, and tried to find some revisions. Reliable sources emphasized that the problem is now intended to be based on the specific proposals put forward by the Western three powers after the first meeting with Stalin and Molotov, and the counter-proposal put forward by the Soviet Union today, to find a compromise. The four-power foreign ministers' meeting must be convened after this compromise is reached. As for the outcome of the meeting, the reliable source is cautiously optimistic, saying that because the procedures for canceling the Berlin blockade and convening the four-power meeting are not easy to achieve, the agreement to convene the meeting is secondary.</p>
<h3>Handling the Issue of Former Italian Colonies: Eighteen Countries Offer Opinions; Discussion at the Vice-Ministers' Meeting May Not Lead to a Conclusion</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Among the eighteen countries attending the Vice-Ministers' Meeting here, the majority favor returning at least one of the former Italian colonies to Italy. The Vice-Ministers' Meeting discussing the issue of the Italian colonies may end without results, and the issue will be discussed again by the United Nations General Assembly when it convenes in Paris in September. Those who advocate expelling Italy from Africa include China, Abyssinia, India, Pakistan, Egypt, and New Zealand. Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia have expressed their intention to have Italy administer its colonies in trust.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 10th] The Canadian government has submitted a memorandum of opinion to the four foreign ministers' representatives on the handling of the former Italian colonies. Unless the indigenous people express their willingness to merge with neighboring countries, it will suggest implementing a trusteeship system for the colonies. Regarding Italian Somaliland, the Canadian government hopes that the Italian government will still have the right to rule the area.</p>
<h3>Britain Orders Reporter to Leave Berlin Immediately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th, United Press] The British authorities have ordered Nado, the Berlin correspondent of the British "Economic Scholar Weekly," to leave Berlin within sixteen hours under surveillance. The details have not been announced. Mr. Nado told other reporters that he learned that the reason he was ordered to leave Germany was because he claimed to be a member of the Control Committee. However, according to British sources, Mr. Nado had confidential documents from the German Economic Committee regarding the economic situation in the Soviet zone and the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 9th] "Nado, the Berlin correspondent for the Economic Scholar Weekly, served in the military, is twenty-four years old, and is a student at Oxford University, studying Soviet issues.

<h3>Universal Disarmament Committee Passes Report to Security Council</h3>
<p>US and Soviet Representatives Engage in Heated Debate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 9th] The United Nations Universal Disarmament Committee formally passed its report to the Security Council today. The report is based on a principle: that further efforts in disarmament must await the establishment of greater international trust. The committee's decision came after a heated debate between the United States and the Soviet Union. During the debate, the two countries accused each other of irresponsible propaganda and responsibility for the lack of achievement in the disarmament talks. Despite Soviet opposition, the committee decided today to submit a progress report to the Security Council, including a statement from the committee's standing committee, stating that successful disarmament negotiations can only progress after the German-Japanese peace treaty, the United Nations guard force, and the control of atomic energy have been resolved.</p>
<h3>The Whole Story of the Friction Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Will Soon Be Made Public: Yugoslavia Prepares to Publish Correspondence Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] According to Belgrade reports, the reasons for the conflict between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union can be found in the correspondence between Tito and Stalin and Molotov in April and May. This correspondence is said to be published recently in the Yugoslav capital. Judging from the contents of the correspondence, the main reason for the friction between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is that the former believes that the Soviet Union is interfering in its affairs. The real cause of the dispute was the Soviet civilian and military experts who went to Yugoslavia after the war. In 1946, Tito proposed that Soviet experts withdraw from Yugoslavia. In addition, Yugoslavia refused to allow the Soviet Union to set up its own intelligence agencies in its territory, and refused to allow Soviet conscription personnel to go to Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government believes that the purpose of the above-mentioned personnel is to "undermine the new Yugoslavia." In addition, the Trieste issue is also related to the conflict between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, because the Soviet Union once pointed out that Yugoslavia was rashly risking the danger of war.</p>
<h3>Moscow Radio Calls for Cooperation Between the United States and the Soviet Union</h3>

Today, cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union will guarantee lasting peace.</p>
<h3>The United States and the Soviet Union Have Entered a Head-On Conflict Over Espionage Cases; Pan Youxin Submits a Note Demanding the Release of a Soviet Teacher</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Youxin, after holding a half-hour meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett on the issue of the two Soviet teachers, Sanmarin and Mrs. Kosonkina, whom the U.S. House of Representatives Committee Investigating Actions that Violate U.S. Interests in the Soviet Union espionage case demanded to question, submitted a note to the State Department demanding the release of Sanmarin. Mr. Pan accused Sanmarin of being detained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and demanded that the United States allow the Soviet Consul General to visit him.</p>
<p>Sanmarin and Mrs. Kosonkina are teachers at the school for the children of Soviet officials in New York. It is said that after their sudden disappearance before they planned to return home on July 31, rumors spread that they were "kidnapped" by Soviet officials, and Mrs. Kosonkina was forcibly taken away from the Tolstoy Farm near New York by the Soviet Consul General in New York on the 7th. According to the Consul General, Mrs. Kosonkina and Sanmarin were both kidnapped by the White Russians. Sanmarin voluntarily visited the Federal Bureau of Investigation yesterday and expressed his willingness to testify at the Congressional hearing on the Soviet espionage case. The aforementioned members of the House of Representatives are still demanding to question Mrs. Kosonkina. The State Department immediately denied Pan Youxin's claim that the U.S. authorities were related to the abduction of the above-mentioned two people by the White Russian organization led by Countess Tolstoy. Pan Youxin accused this White Russian organization of preventing the above-mentioned two people from returning home, and said that the U.S. government was involved in this conspiracy.</p>
<p>The United States Protects Sanmarin to Testify in the Espionage Case</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] The U.S. House of Representatives Un-American Activities Investigation Committee will subpoena Soviet mathematics teacher Sanmarin, who is currently "evading the Soviet secret police political security bureau," and his wife to Washington to testify at the committee's espionage hearing on the 10th. Mr. San is currently in the New York area, and is under the committee's "strict protection." His wife and four children are hiding on a farm in New Jersey, guarded by a White Russian underground organization. Mr. San's refusal to return home has greatly frustrated the Soviet personnel, and the White Russian side is desperately protecting him.</p>

<h3>Discussing the Draft Danube River Convention; French Amendment Rejected; Italy Requests to Participate in the Belgrade Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Belgrade, 10th, United Press] The Danube River Conference recently rejected the French amendment to the draft convention prepared by the Soviet Union by a vote of seven to three. The amendment sought to establish freedom of navigation and freedom of commerce for all countries, and to place the work of the Danube River Commission within the scope of the United Nations Charter. The French amendment was first discussed among the 23 items proposed by the Western group. The Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine opposed the amendment because the conference could not change the resolution of the 1946 Foreign Ministers' Conference or the terms of the peace treaties with the German satellite states. U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia Kennan urged the passage of the U.S. amendment to delete the preamble to the Soviet draft convention, hoping that the amendment would be beneficial to the peaceful relations and economic prosperity of the Danube River based on the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 10th] The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Italian government has submitted a note to the Danube River Conference meeting in Belgrade, stating that Italy has the right to participate in the conference. The reason for submitting this note is based on two facts: Italy signed the 1921 Danube River Treaty, and Italian territory is connected to the Western Danube River system through waterways such as the Drava River.</p>
<h3>Little Stalin's Behind-the-Scenes Life (2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by this newspaper's translation department</p>
<p>(Original article published in the American "Observer Magazine" on August 17th)</p>
<p>Privileged Existence</p>
<p>Once, Vasily went to Moscow, wearing his full military uniform and medals to see his father, and reported to the Commander-in-Chief in a smart manner: "Colonel Stalin reports to the Marshal." The weary Marshal showed no interest in his son's achievements, only responding coldly: "This is all Novikov's doing. He deliberately promoted you, wanting to use this to win my favor. But remember: unless you truly earn that rank through your own efforts, I will never sign that order recommending your promotion to general."</p>
<p>The Colonel returned to his unit with his head drooping, telling his comrades what his father had said, then resentfully said: "It's really not good for Father to hold such a position. I can't play tricks on him. I can only wait for him to have mercy on his own."</p>
<p>Such a father would certainly hinder Vasily's ambition to seek a general's rank, but without him, Vasily probably wouldn't have lived the luxurious life that most senior generals could only dream of. The Colonel had four exquisite cars imported from Moscow. His food and necessities were supplied by the Kremlin stores, which specialized in providing privileged customers with high-quality wines, canned food, caviar, cigarettes, and shirts. When his unit rotated, his quartermaster found the finest camps for him, arranging large, comfortable beds, snow-white silk quilts, radios, pianos, etc. The exquisite furnishings were far beyond what could be hoped for in front-line life. His clothes were made by his father's tailor, and he often relaxed in the best entertainment venues in the Caucasus Mountains. Only the Politburo members—the darlings of the Soviet Union—could compare with Vasily.</p>
<p>Indulgence and Hardship for Subordinates</p>
<p>However, it must be said that although Colonel Vasily lived a privileged life, he always thought of his unit. He often used his name to call the highest military supply agencies, shouting loudly: "I am Stalin," demanding that they issue Lend-Lease uniforms, fresh food, and warm imported underwear for his air force personnel to use. They ate American pork, fresh meat, condensed milk, cocoa, chocolate, cheese, and white bread in the unit's dining hall, while other units ate millet porridge and stale food for months. In addition, he often helped the families of his subordinates.</p>
<p>Therefore, Vasily was loved by his unit, but because he lacked talent and military experience, they did not respect him as a commander. On the surface, all orders went through him, but the actual commander was his assistant, who came from the same rank as him. Serious work was not entrusted to Vasily because he lacked patience and was extraordinarily disorganized, doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>A large plane carrying bombs suddenly exploded at the unit's airfield. Vasily immediately detained several officers. He repeatedly ordered his subordinates to line up, pacing back and forth with a pistol in his hand, shouting that he would personally shoot the saboteur. A few days later, another plane suddenly exploded. After investigation, it was determined that the explosion was due to defects in the bombs themselves.</p>

<h3>City Police Department Launched Lightning Operation Yesterday, Cracking Down on Seven Foreign Exchange Racketeering Organizations, Operating a Total of 10 Trillion Legal Tender in Hong Kong Exchange, Arresting Twenty-Five People for Interrogation Overnight</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The City Police Department yesterday cracked down on seven private Hong Kong exchange racketeering agencies. The scale of several of these organizations and the amount of money involved broke the previous records of the Lin Wang and San Wei companies. According to preliminary estimates, the total Hong Kong exchange transactions involved exceeded 10 trillion legal tender. The police department invested painstaking effort in investigating this case, starting to deploy undercover agents as early as October last year. Subsequently, the original texts of the coded telegrams sent daily by these seven agencies via secret radio stations and the amount of foreign exchange transactions were recorded in detail, compiled into lists, and statistically analyzed. Until recently, when the opportunity was deemed ripe, a lightning operation was launched yesterday morning to wipe out these seven secret organizations in one fell swoop. In addition to seizing a large number of account books, code originals, correspondence, U.S. dollars, and Hong Kong dollars on the spot, twenty-five suspects were arrested. After overnight interrogation, the key individuals will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court today for trial.</p>

<h3>Chennault Air Transport Team Violates Regulations, Affecting Business of Two Airline Companies</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) protested to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) regarding the Chennault Air Transport Team's transport of banknotes to Xiamen, the CAA has yet to provide a formal response. However, the responsible officials of the Ministry of Transportation have indicated that they will urge the Chennault Air Transport Team to operate flights on certain designated routes in the future to avoid hindering the business of CNAC and the Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC). It is reported that the designated flight routes for the Chennault Air Transport Team include the Shanghai-Lanzhou, Ping-Sui, and Sui-Ning lines, but these routes are relatively remote and have little passenger or cargo traffic. Therefore, the team rarely operates these flights and instead develops routes that already have scheduled flights operated by CNAC or CATC, greatly affecting the business of the two airline companies.</p>
<h3>Civil Aeronautics Administration Statement, No Violation of Contract</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Transportation's Civil Aeronautics Administration issued a statement regarding the Xiamen banknote transport case: (1) The contract signed between the Civil Air Transport (CAT) and the government stipulates that the team can freely fly and operate unscheduled passenger, cargo, and mail transport between all civil airports. Article 13 of the contract states that when the Civil Air Transport team operates unscheduled routes for the transport of passengers, cargo, and mail, it may use the following designated airports in addition to using airports on scheduled routes: A, airports under the jurisdiction of the CAA, and B, military airports (airport names are simplified). Xiamen falls under the jurisdiction of the CAA, and this flight is therefore legal. (2) The authority to determine whether passengers carrying banknotes in their luggage violates regulations and how to restrict it falls under the jurisdiction of other competent authorities.</p>
<h3>Financial Control Bureau Strengthens Inspection, Adds Ten Audit Teams</h3>
<p>Director Lin Discusses Restrictions on Check Usage</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that in order to strengthen the inspection of financial institutions, the number of auditors in the city's Financial Control Bureau will be expanded from the current ten teams to twenty teams. At the same time, ten teams of Central Bank personnel will be used as a reserve force, ready to be fully deployed when necessary. Furthermore, after the Financial Control Bureau inspected financial institutions last week, it was found that the operations of some institutions exceeded the normal scope. An announcement will be made once the review is completed.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Financial Control Bureau Director Lin stated: The purpose of restricting the same-day use of checks is to suppress credit expansion and should be implemented in accordance with the government's established policy. However, during implementation, the lack of cash, the prevalence of cashier's checks, and the premium on large denomination banknotes are unavoidable adverse phenomena. In the future, as the cash shortage situation improves, these signs may disappear. Furthermore, the inspection of financial institutions will continue to be carried out. Recently, a few institutions have been found to have unsound operations, and they will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3>Hotel Industry Requests Price Increase, Compiles Cost Survey Form, Salaries and Wages are the Largest Item, Nearly 46%, Social Affairs Bureau to Draft Methods for Adjusting Room Rates</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The city's hotel industry previously submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to increase prices. The Social Affairs Bureau did not approve the request, as prices had just been increased recently. However, it instructed the industry to compile a percentage breakdown of various hotel costs, and after assessing the various expenditures, a decision would be made on how much to increase room rates. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a temporary evaluation meeting with approximately 30 representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and hotel labor and management to discuss this issue. Based on data obtained from 20 hotels, including the Dalu, Dongfang, Yangzi, Nanjing, and Jue Lu hotels, a cost survey form for April, May, and June of the 1948 League of Hotel Companies in Shanghai was compiled. Among them, salaries and wages accounted for 45.71% (based on the cost of living index), food accounted for 5.68% (based on medium-quality rice and vegetable oil), fuel accounted for 8.37% (based on white coal), textiles accounted for 5.08% (based on Longtou broadcloth), daily necessities accounted for 3.21% (based on soap), decoration accounted for 4.19%, additions accounted for 2.07% (both based on foreign nails, cement, and foreign pine), laundry accounted for 1.57% (based on prices published by the Laundry Industry Association), stationery accounted for 1.05% (based on newsprint and ink), miscellaneous items accounted for 4.91% (based on the cost of living index), public utilities accounted for 13.45%, taxes accounted for 2.43%, and rent accounted for 1.55%. Based on the percentages obtained from the above survey, the Social Affairs Bureau will draft a calculation method to facilitate the adjustment of hotel room rates. This method will be presented at the evaluation meeting to be held on the 16th of this month for discussion.</p>
<h3>Private Shipping Companies Do Not Stop at the Capital, Due to Too Many Ticketless Passengers, Authorities are Discussing Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news: The Ministry of Transportation recently ordered the Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Shipping Industry Association to ensure that all private shipping companies stop at Nanjing, as Nanjing is not a stop for ships of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, resulting in especially crowded conditions for passengers awaiting transport. However, private companies consider that there are too many ticketless passengers in the capital, and they act collectively. As soon as the ship docks, they swarm aboard, and the military police maintaining order on the dock cannot stop them. After these people board, they not only travel without tickets but also seize cabins,搶飯搶菜, and commit assault against the crew. As a result, passengers who actually pay for tickets cannot receive the treatment they are entitled to, and they complain to the shipping companies. In addition, the number of passengers that ships can carry is regulated by the Maritime Affairs Bureau. If they carry too many passengers, the shipping companies bear greater responsibility in the event of an accident. Therefore, before the security authorities in the capital have effective measures to prevent ticketless passengers, private companies remain hesitant to try stopping there and insist that the Ministry of Transportation provide a concrete guarantee before complying with the order. The Ministry of Transportation is currently in consultation with the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense and the Capital Police Department.</p>

<h3>Difficulties Faced by Two Railway Bureaus, Selling One Ticket, Counting Money Takes One Minute</h3>
<p>The Jin-Hu Railway Bureau is currently facing a major difficulty, namely the extremely large amount of time wasted counting banknotes when purchasing tickets. On average, the time spent counting banknotes for each ticket requires one minute. According to the railway bureau's regulations, tickets must be sold two hours before the train departs. Within two hours, only 120 tickets can be sold. This is not only inconvenient for passengers, but also has a huge impact on the railway bureau's own operating income. The railway bureau considered using cashier's checks to purchase tickets, but concluded that forgeries would inevitably be discovered in large numbers, making implementation difficult. Currently, in order to alleviate the difficulty of selling tickets, in addition to opening more ticket windows, two points are being considered: (1) Various institutions, organizations, companies, and factories can sign agreements with the bureau in advance, and when purchasing tickets, they can use cashier's checks stamped with the company's seal; (2) Please ask passengers to make full use of telegrams to purchase tickets. Whether the first item will be implemented is currently under serious consideration.</p>
<h3>High-Speed Train Departs for Shanghai This Morning, For the Fourth Test Run</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the air-conditioned high-speed train of the Jin-Hu Railway Bureau left the factory last month, the air-conditioning equipment has repeatedly experienced obstacles. Recently, it was heard that after the engineers of the Qishuyan Machine Factory carefully studied the results, the difficulties with the air-conditioning device have gradually been overcome. A short-distance test run was conducted between Zhenjiang and Qishuyan some days ago. Although there were still some areas that were not as ideal, there was significant progress compared to before. It was further improved after returning to the factory. Xie Zhen, Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau and Director of the Transportation Department, personally went to Qishuyan yesterday morning to inspect it. Yesterday, news came from the Qishuyan Factory that the high-speed train will be driven to Shanghai by Deputy Director Xie himself this morning for the fourth test run. Whether a full Jin-Hu test run will be conducted again depends on the results of this morning's test run. It is generally expected that this test run will not encounter any more obstacles as before.</p>
<h3>Students Donate Generously to Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>On May 22nd of this year, this newspaper's local edition published a news item that American automotive merchant Mr. and Mrs. Kirk, in memory of their only son, Mike, who was killed in action in France, specifically funded their former Chinese friend, Mr. Xu Jingdao, to study in the United States. Recently, according to Mr. Xu Guifu, Xu's father, after his son arrived in the United States and after several months of tutoring, he has been admitted to Harding College to study. Because he is concerned about the difficult situation and education loss for young people in his motherland, he donated his usual savings of five U.S. dollars to this newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund", and hopes that all Chinese students in the United States can节俭开支, save on expenses and help young people in their motherland. This is also a great story in the scholarship movement.</p>
<p>Xu Jingdao does not forget to help others when he receives help</p>
<h3>Factory Takeover, Complications Arise, Inciting Workers to Use Violence, Creditors Accused of Two Crimes</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tan Tiecheng from Changzhou and Xu Wenji from Cixi are representatives of the unsecured creditor group of the Xin Kang Flour Mill in this city. On December 19th, 1946, they signed a settlement record with Zhu Meisun, the owner of the factory. On the 30th of the same month, Xu and Tan went to take over the factory in accordance with the provisions of the first item of the record. However, the workers remaining in the factory refused to hand it over because they had not received notice from the factory owner. In March 1947, Xu and Tan went to take over for the second time, but there were no results. On August 10th, Zhu sent a letter agreeing to resolve the matter within seven days, and stated that if there was another delay, he would, in accordance with the provisions of the seventh item of the settlement record, allow the creditor group to freely dispose of all collateral. However, Zhu did not fulfill the agreement when the deadline arrived. On the 20th of the same month, both parties signed a new settlement contract, converting the debt into 1.4 billion national currency units, with 20%, or 280 million yuan, to be paid first on September 30th, and the remainder to be paid in installments. Unexpectedly, the check bounced upon maturity. On October 2nd of the same year, Xu and Tan, feeling extremely angry that Zhu had failed to fulfill both the old and new contracts, invited Sun Zhongxuan, a judicial section member from the Yulin Road Police Station, and three men with guns to go to the factory and forcibly take it over. The two sides insisted until 9:00 PM, but the matter was still not resolved. Xu and Tan then incited the factory workers to use violence, injuring Zhu and others. Afterwards, Zhu reported the incident to the police, and Xu and Tan were arrested and sent to the local prosecutor's office to be dealt with according to law. The prosecutor's office has concluded the investigation of the case and has filed public charges of obstructing freedom and assault.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Female Passengers on the Plane, Opium Found in Handbag</h3>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, the customs personnel boarded China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight 101 from Ping to Shanghai to conduct an inspection. Eighty grams of opium were found in the handbag of a fashionably dressed female passenger, Liang Xiudi. After being caught, Liang's face turned pale, and she hurriedly argued that the opium was being taken to her godmother for her godmother to quit smoking, and that she did not smoke herself, and requested a test. Liang and the eighty grams of opium were transferred by the customs to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, Officially Established in Shanghai, Coordinating with U.S. Aid to Systematically Supply Civilian Food</h3>
<p>The Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food, has been officially established in Shanghai, and Director Yang Chuo'an has also taken office. The committee's task is to coordinate with U.S. aid to supply food to urban residents, so that the already successful rationing work can continue smoothly. It is reported that U.S. aid food worth 70 million U.S. dollars is currently arriving in batches and being transferred by the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration to our side for processing. This food is designated for rationing to the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou for nine months, but the amount is only sufficient for 40% of the total needs. How to control the remaining 60% in order to coordinate with U.S. aid is a matter of deep concern to the government. It is felt that there should be an organization responsible for this and that the funds for purchasing grain should be systematically planned. This is the motivation for establishing the committee. From now on, for urban grain rationing, our country will raise 60% of the grain itself, estimated to be about 500,000 tons. In addition to one-fifth of the grain that the committee has ordered from abroad, the committee has decided to entrust existing government agencies with experience, such as the Agricultural Bank of China and the Cooperative Bank, to purchase, transport, and store grain in domestic production areas to supply to the city's food distribution agencies for rationing to the citizens. It is generally believed that after the establishment of the committee, there will be no concern about the source of rationing grain, and urban residents will be guaranteed a reliable food supply.</p>

<h3>Council Committee Resolves Public Utility Pricing: New Calculation Standards to be Established; Automatic Adjustment Formula to be Abolished; Further Discussion at Tomorrow's Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Public Utilities Research Committee of the Municipal Council continued its meeting yesterday morning. Attending councilors included Fei Shusheng, Li Wenjie, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, Xu Xueyu, Yan Esheng, Shui Xiangyun, Qu Yue, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shao Yongsheng, and others. The Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Director Zhao, was also present. Councilor Jiang Hao served as chairman. During the meeting, further examination was made of the issue of price increases for public utilities, and relatively concrete improvement methods were proposed. After synthesizing the opinions offered by various councilors, the following six points were summarized as review opinions. The Public Utilities Committee will convene again on the 12th to submit the review opinions from yesterday's committee meeting for discussion and to determine the date for convening a temporary general meeting. The six review opinions decided yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Request the Municipal Government to immediately abolish the automatic adjustment formula for public utility prices.</p>
<p>(2) Request the Central Government to exempt tariffs and surcharges on oil used by public utilities.</p>
<p>(3) Request the Central Government to pre-settle or pre-purchase foreign exchange and coal needed for all materials and oil supplies required by public utilities for three months at a time, and thereafter settle and purchase on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>(4) All oil supplies and equipment accessories that can be supplied from US aid materials should be calculated at the lowest price. In addition to requesting this from the Central Government, the Municipal Government is also requested to directly negotiate with the US Aid Utilization Committee.</p>
<p>(5) Request the Central Bank to continue providing monthly loans.</p>
<p>(6) Starting from September, after the original formula is abolished, request the Public Utilities Bureau to establish new calculation standards based on the following principles. The principles for the calculation standards are as follows:</p>
<p>Explanation: Because the public utility price calculation formula was originally established by the National Economic Council and has been revised. Taking the electricity price calculation formula as an example, the base number for business expenses per kilowatt-hour was incorporated into the local metal material price index, originally only at 10%, but was later revised to 60% for the cost of living index and 40% for the metal index, which is obviously unreasonable. If it continues to be adopted, it will only increase the unreasonable burden on citizens and must be stopped. Therefore, it is proposed to use the following principles as temporary standards for calculating public utility prices:</p>
<p>Eight Principles as Pricing Standards</p>
<p>(1) The base number for oil, coal, materials, and equipment should be calculated based on the actual average index from January to June of this year. For example, the coal usage base per kilowatt-hour (average number from January to June this year) multiplied by the average coal price, the oil usage base per kilowatt-hour (average number from January to June this year) multiplied by the average oil price, the material maintenance cost per kilowatt-hour (items of a capital expenditure nature should be eliminated, and the cost must be calculated based on a weighted average method) multiplied by the monthly metal price index compiled by the Municipal Government, and so on.</p>
<p>(2) Dividends and interest should not be calculated in US dollars.</p>
<p>(3) The cost of living index for staff should be calculated based on the average of the two times of the previous month and should not be pre-added. (For example, the base salary of staff per kilowatt-hour (January to June this year) multiplied by the average of the upper and lower months of the previous month for the workers' cost of living index).</p>
<p>(4) The amount of tax should be calculated based on the total cost, and then the tax rate percentage.</p>
<p>(5) The metal index should be calculated based on the average of the four weeks of the previous month, and should not be calculated based on the black market price, and should not be subject to additional taxes.</p>
<p>(6) Business expenses should be reduced. For example, the depreciation expense per kilowatt-hour should not be calculated for machines not in use. Taking electricity as an example, that is, the other expenses that should be borne per kilowatt-hour should be based on the actual expenses of the previous month, minus the cost of coal, oil, material maintenance, depreciation, and staff salaries. However, the expenditure for the offsetting of dividend foreign exchange liabilities is not included. The actual expenditure should be disclosed, and the Public Utilities Bureau should carefully review it.</p>
<p>(7) Foreign staff and senior staff should be paid the same as other employees and should not be treated excessively favorably.</p>
<p>(8) The labor base number should be calculated based on the average from January to June of this year.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the number of foreign staff and their actual income, please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to investigate and announce it.</p>
<h3>Direct Tax Bureau Lays Off Over a Hundred People</h3>
<p>Laid-off Personnel to Discuss Countermeasures Today</p>
<p>The Direct Tax Bureau is implementing austerity measures, and yesterday officially notified the laid-off personnel, totaling over 110 people. The laid-off personnel expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the authorities' measures, especially those who passed the examination and transferred military officers. They have scheduled a meeting this morning within the bureau to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs Expire; District Court Temporarily Suspends Adjudication of Drug Cases</h3>
<p>The Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs, promulgated and implemented by the government on August 2, 1946, expired on August 2 of this year. Because the new regulations have not yet been promulgated, the district court has suspended the hearing of opium and drug cases accepted from the 3rd, awaiting new orders. The Wang Zhibin drug trafficking case has also been postponed as a result.</p>
<h3>Cement Exports Should be Given Foreign Exchange; Adjustment to 60% Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Cement Industry Association states that domestic construction is currently stalled, and cement sales are decreasing. If sales are not promoted abroad, the production of various factories will be difficult to maintain. In the first half of this year, Taiwan and other companies exported 32,200 tons to the Dutch East Indies. However, in the past one or two months, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan have been dumping cement in Southeast Asia. For domestic cement exports, the government has limited the foreign exchange provided to 55% to supply raw material imports. According to the situation a month ago, the Free on Board (FOB) price per ton of exported cement was about US$16, only 65% of the manufacturing cost, making it impossible to compete with American, Soviet, and Japanese merchants. Therefore, representatives such as Chen Fanyou were dispatched to visit Director Huo of the Export Control Committee and Director Chen of the Export Promotion Office to explain the difficult situation and request that the limited percentage of foreign exchange provided be increased to increase raw material imports. It is reported that Director Huo has agreed to adjust the ratio from 55% to 60%.</p>
<h3>Damaging the Reputation of the Principal by Posting Flyers; School Director Sued</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Dai Zhengqing, a school director of the Jianghuai Zhabei Elementary School, a private school in this city, was dissatisfied with the principal of the school, Wang Bingzhi. He posted flyers on the front and back doors of Wang's residence and on the glass windows of the school, which read: "Wang Bingzhi has a base character, improper behavior, no qualifications, and is using public office for private gain by ambiguously publishing the school's accounts. It has recently been heard that he is privately soliciting donations into his own pocket, which is hateful and should be dismissed." Wang, who was insulted, filed a lawsuit accusing Dai of damaging his reputation. After several investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office, Dai strongly denied it, claiming that the handwriting on the flyers was different from his own. However, witnesses Jiang Fengxiang and Zhang Ritong testified that Dai had indeed personally posted and distributed the flyers. Therefore, a public prosecution was initiated on the charge of damaging his reputation.</p>
<h3>Reporting a Theft While Checking Household Registrations; Two Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wang Huagui from Jingjiang, 23 years old, used to be a member of the self-defense team of the Sanle Township Office in Jingjiang, carrying a German-made No. 2 box pistol. Recently, he and his fellow villager Yun Zhihe came to Shanghai with weapons and temporarily resided at the tailor shop of Yun's younger brother at No. 9 Daodeli, Jinling West Road. After lingering for several days, feeling extremely bored, they were guided by Yun to the home of Wang Cai, an acquaintance at No. 186 Huichang Lane, Huashan Road, to commit robbery on the afternoon of the 8th around 8:00 PM. After the victim cried for help, Police Officer No. 690 from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who had just finished checking household registrations and was passing by, heard the sound and rushed to arrest the two thieves, seizing the murder weapons and escorting them to the branch office. They are currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Detective to Extort Money; Arrested on the Way Back After Obtaining Funds</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, Zhang Nengzhao, carrying a membership badge of the Shanghai Lizhi Society, led unemployed hooligans Ding Dianxiao and Chen Haiqi to the home of Gong Nianbao at No. 4 Dingkang Lane, Fanhhuangdu Road, impersonating a detective from the Putuo Road Branch Office. Under the pretext of investigating stolen goods, they extorted 300 million yuan. After Gong repeatedly requested a reduction, it was reduced to 100 million yuan. Then Zhang followed Gong out to borrow money from Qiao Jinbo at the Heping Hotel in Caojiadu Wujiaochang but failed. He then went to Wang Xiaolin on Singapore Road and borrowed five promissory notes totaling 60 million yuan. This matter was discovered by Xu Senfu, a patrol officer of the Criminal Division of the Putuo Road Police Branch. He immediately led officers Wang Xiaoqing and Hua Zhenting, along with Police Officer No. 3063, to wait at No. 4 Dingkang Lane. When Zhang Nengzhao and others returned after obtaining the five promissory notes, they were arrested together and taken to the bureau for interrogation. Zhang confessed that he was a worker at the Lizhi Society. Ding and Chen were pedicab drivers. Recently, because the pedicab owner increased the deposit by 100 million yuan, they could not raise the money. Therefore, they discussed with their colleague Wang Xiaoyuan, who lived at No. 402 Xinji Street, Fanhhuangdu Road, to engage in extortion. Subsequently, accomplice Wang Xiaoyuan was arrested and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning yesterday.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Muslim Pilgrimage Group Departs Today; Carrying Many Daily Necessities; Expected to Return by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Muslim Pilgrimage Group from Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, totaling 160 members, has arrived in Shanghai in batches, led by Group Leader Hua De'er, Deputy Group Leader Shen Linhan, and Ma Rongqing. The group's original itinerary was to travel by boat via Hong Kong and Singapore, and then transfer to a special ship directly to the holy city of Mecca. However, due to the limited number of berths between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the itinerary was temporarily changed to depart in several batches. The first batch of 48 people will depart for Hong Kong on the Shengjing Wheel this morning, and the rest will fly to Hong Kong for assembly on the next two days. Ding Lingting, the Secretary-General of the China Islamic Association, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to take care of the arrangements. According to him, Muslims in the Northwest have "five pillars" that must be fulfilled in their lives, namely "Shahada" (declaration of faith), "Salat" (prayer), "Sawm" (fasting), "Zakat" (charity), and "Hajj" (pilgrimage). Going on pilgrimage to the holy land is one of the five pillars, so Muslims attach great importance to it. Everyone considers it the greatest comfort to be able to go to Mecca once in their lifetime. Because the government respects the beliefs of Muslims, it has stipulated that Muslims be sent to the holy land for pilgrimage once a year since last year. Although the country is currently experiencing economic difficulties, it has still approved an allocation of £7,200 in foreign exchange for the group's travel expenses. The group needs to stay in Mecca until the end of the year before returning to the country. It is estimated that each member will need about £300 in foreign exchange. The government's current foreign exchange quota is only £35 per person, and the shortfall will be supplemented by each member applying for self-provided foreign exchange. The group stated yesterday that the government handles their passports and foreign exchange matters every year with great speed, so that the Muslim pilgrimage can be successfully achieved. All Muslims in the Northwest are extremely grateful. Because the group will be staying abroad for a long time this time, in addition to a complete set of cooking utensils, each person is carrying medicines, "Junbai" (the pilgrimage robes), "Hastal" (the white cloth used to wrap the head), ablution kettles, seasonings, and other items.</p>

In addition to the defendants Liu Anping, Jiang Nengxiang, Xu Xin from China Aviation Company and Deng Gaozhang from Central Aviation Company, the court also summoned five defense witnesses, Lin Dakang, Shi Dafu, Wu Liexing, Wang Dingnan, and Ding Yeye, from Peiping, Xi'an, and other places to testify. Lin and Shi were employees of the Peiping office of Central Aviation Company. They stated: "In July of last year, they worked in the airport or receiving department in turns. They only knew Dabe Company, but did not know Qi Nianzhu. They also stated: "There was more than one company transporting goods between Peiping and Shanghai, and there was no refusal to transport goods from Dabe or other companies. There are company shipping records to prove it." The defense lawyer for the defendant stated: "In addition to Dabe Company, they also transported goods for the Joint Logistics Headquarters, the Northwest Industrial Company, and the Hwa Mao Company." Regarding the accusation of refusing to transport goods by Peiping merchants, Lin and Shi Chen stated: "The company receives goods entirely based on the application form filled out by the merchants, which is approved by Director Yan Duzhou." Next, Lang Liexing, who worked at the Peiping office of Central Aviation Company last year and was later transferred to Xi'an, testified. His testimony was generally the same as that of Lin and Shi, but he stated that he only submitted aircraft take-off and landing reports and never went to the office, so he did not know whether Central Aviation Company refused to transport goods from other companies. Next, the court inquired about the details of the investigation by the Military Affairs Bureau and questioned Wang Dingnan, the current director of the Peiping office of Central Aviation Company. He stated: "In October of last year, the former director of the Peiping office, Yan Duzhou, requested a transfer, which was approved by the head office. I was ordered to transfer from Jinan to Peiping to take over the position, then transferred to Nanchang. However, after Yan came to Shanghai from Peiping, he resigned. Yan's wife said that her husband left Peiping at the end of April this year, but she could not guarantee whether it was true. On November 23 of last year, the Military Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate. Because I took over on October 14, I did not know anything about the situation of air transport between Peiping and Shanghai from July to September last year. There was no way to answer, so I arranged for Shi Dafu, Wu Liexing, and two other relevant personnel to discuss it the next day. The results were unknown." Finally, the witness Ding Yefu, the secretary of the Jinshan Company, stated that the fugitive defendant Zhou Peiran was not an employee of the Jinshan Company. He did not know whether he was using the name to contact air transport. The Jinshan Company did not have a branch in Peiping and had no relationship with China Aviation Company. At this point, the court further interrogated the four defendants, and their statements were the same as before. The prosecutors present then rose to state the intentions of the prosecution. The defendant's lawyers then began to debate, and Deng Gaojun also submitted additional evidence. At around 6:00 PM, the debate ended, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 16th of this month.</p>

<h3>Travel Notes Outside the Pass (V): Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Lanzhou, 2nd (by airmail)] The sun doesn't set in Dunhuang until after 9:00 PM. After dinner, we still have plenty of time to stroll through the streets. Dunhuang doesn't have many main streets, but there are dozens of alleys, all named after various prefectures and counties in Gansu. It is said that after the city was completed in the sixth year of the Yongzheng reign of the late Qing Dynasty, people from various prefectures and counties in Gansu were moved here and lived in separate districts, so the alley names were directly based on place names.</p>
<p>Among the three counties and one bureau outside the pass, Dunhuang has the largest area, with over 140,000 square kilometers, and at least 150,000 mu of fertile land suitable for farming. Canals crisscross the area, and there are few disputes over water conservancy. We went out of the city to the Dang River to watch the sunset. In the sandy land, we saw towering willows, continuous stretches of flat fields, turbulent rivers, and dense orchards, as if we were in Jiangnan. The melons and fruits of Dunhuang used to be tribute items and have a long-standing reputation. Unfortunately, they are not yet ripe when we arrived. There is only one type of pear-sized apricot, which has a different taste than Lanzhou apricots. Cotton is not produced in various places in Hexi, but Dunhuang alone produces over 700,000 catties of cotton per year. The people spin yarn and weave homemade cloth, which can be used to clothe themselves. This year's rainfall is suitable, and over 100,000 shi of wheat can be harvested.</p>
<p>Dunhuang's Population Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>The population of Dunhuang is also decreasing day by day. In the past, during the Han and Tang dynasties, there were 130,000 people in one prefecture and six counties, but now there is only a fraction of that. There are also more than 600 Mongols living around Nanhu, organized under the direct jurisdiction of the county. These descendants of the Han, who fled here, have lost the ability to hunt on horseback and have become tenant farmers for the locals.</p>
<p>Heavily Made-up Young Women</p>
<p>Dunhuang has a special custom, which is that during temple fairs, all unmarried women are heavily made up and come from all over the countryside to the fair to be judged, without feeling ashamed. Young men roam around in the crowd, looking for a partner, and then inquire about their family background and ask someone to be a matchmaker. Religion is particularly prosperous here. In the Guandi Temple, which was rebuilt in the 30th year of the Republic, we saw a large iron knife weighing about 180 catties, which two people had difficulty lifting. Next to the temple, there are also several sections of the "Great Tang Governor Yang Gong Ji De Stele" and the "Great Tang Hexi Road Guiyi Army Jiedushi Suo Gong Ji De Stele." According to the county chronicles, the "Little Penglai Mountain" lantern shed in front of the drum tower used to be as grand as the Lantern Festival in the Western Capital, but the people of today rarely have this kind of interest.</p>
<p>Ancient Yumenguan and Yangguan</p>
<p>Several dozen li west of the city is the ancient Yumenguan, which is the place where the Han people said, "I only wish to be born into Yumenguan." Several dozen li southwest is Yangguan, which is the place in the Tang poem "West of Yangguan, there are no old friends." Beyond the two passes, only the ancient battlefield elegies "Vast, the flat sands are boundless, labor is not seen… Dark, bleak, the wind is sad and the sun is setting" can describe it.</p>
<p>Red Willow Used as Fuel</p>
<p>The most serious problem in Dunhuang is the lack of fuel. There is no coal production nearby, and the people burn red willow and various weeds from the grass lake. Currently, the places for cutting firewood are getting farther and farther away, and there are disputes over firewood with neighboring areas. If the wild firewood is exhausted in the future and the coal resources have not been developed, it is feared that the nearby forests will be reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Current and Past Dynamics of the Kazakhs</p>
<p>The people of Dunhuang and Anxi are most threatened by the harassment of the Kazakhs living in the southern mountains. The Kazakh people mostly live in the Ashan area in the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains. After the "April 12th" coup in Xinjiang in 1933, they gradually moved eastward and merged with the Kazakhs in Zhenxi. The Kazakh people are naturally mobile and extremely unwilling to be restricted, let alone change their way of life. After Sheng Shicai came to power, he adopted terror tactics and suppressed them in every possible way. The Kazakhs were afraid of being communized, so they regarded Gansu as a happy land and came to join them one after another. In 1936 and 1937, they entered the Qilian Mountains and drove out the original Mongols. In a few years, they all had cattle, sheep, horses, and camels and became increasingly wealthy. In February of last year, the government funded the repatriation of most of them to Xinjiang. Now only 2,400 people live in the mountains south of Andun and graze their livestock, occasionally coming out of the mountains to plunder livestock. According to the Dunhuang county magistrate, a small number of people are also planting opium. When we were in Dunhuang, the county government sent people to Hongliugou to investigate and eradicate opium seedlings. We heard that the area planted was very large, but no one was guarding it.</p>
<p>The Kazakhs in the southern mountains are now led by six leaders, including Husayn and Agonbayi. In recent years, the military and political authorities have repeatedly allowed funding for repatriation to Xinjiang, but they are always unwilling to leave quickly. This year, they promised to start departing one after another from August 1, and everyone hopes that this time will not be disappointing.</p>
<h3>Strange Sight in Ningbo: Three to Four Thousand Swallows and Sparrows Flying Through Crowds</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Ningbo, 10th] At around 9:00 AM on the 9th, three to four thousand swallows and sparrows suddenly flew into the sky above Xinhetou, Jiangdong, soaring back and forth, flying through the crowds without any fear. Residents stopped to watch, exclaiming in surprise. After two hours, they flew away to the southeast.</p>
<h3>Yin Baochang Wu Kunyao's Home Robbed of Cash and Jewelry by Bandits</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Ningbo, 10th] On the 9th, Wu Kunyao, the Yinxi Dantang Baochang, hosted a grand banquet for relatives and friends for his son Jiabao's wedding. While everyone was in high spirits, more than a dozen bandits suddenly rushed in with guns. One of the bandits was on the lookout outside, while the other bandits searched every room. After an hour, they howled and fled, with a total loss of no less than 10 billion in cash and jewelry.</p>
<h3>Numerous Nantong Bank Drafts; The Pacification Headquarters Requests the Ministry of Finance to Crack Down</h3>
<p>The Level of the Wealth Levy has been Decided</p>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch, 8th] Due to the shortage of cash in Nantong, the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the First Pacification Area has reported to the Ministry of Finance requesting a swift crackdown on the practice of issuing bank drafts by national, provincial, and county banks, as well as private banks. These drafts, whether issued directly or after being approved by the head office, have reached several hundred billion in value. They have also ordered the National Bank to expedite the transport of cash for relief.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Nanjing Relief Special Levy has allocated 20 billion to this county for fundraising, and the provincial government has telegraphed the Speaker of the County Council, urging him to quickly promote fundraising.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the wealth levy being imposed in this county, which was reported in this newspaper on the 6th, the levels of collection have now been revised to be calculated based on rice prices. For commercial banks and private banks, factories, and companies, they will be divided into five levels: those with 1,000 stones or more, 500 stones or more, 100 stones or more, 50 stones or more, and 10 stones or more, and they will be levied monthly. Wealthy households will be divided into four levels: 100 stones or more, 100 stones or more, 50 stones or more, and 20 stones or more, with a one-time collection.</p>
<h3>Theft and Sale of Relief Medicines; Director of Zhenhai Hospital Flees</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenhai Dispatch] Yu Guanqiu, the director of the county hospital, stole and sold relief medicines. After being reported, he fled in fear of punishment on the morning of the 7th, leaving no trace. County Magistrate Jiang and the local prosecutor's office have telegraphed Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to request assistance in the arrest.</p>
<h3>Former and Current Mayors of Nanchang Embezzle Large Sums; Exposed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 10th] Tang Xin, the former mayor of Nanchang, embezzled 200 million in suppression and construction funds, and the current mayor, Xiong Jun, also embezzled 4 billion. In addition, the municipal government's cooperative also embezzled 300 million. After being reported, the suppression and construction committee decided to recover the full amount. From January to June of this year, a total of 19 billion in suppression and construction donations were collected and deposited in municipal banks, without any interest accrued so far.</p>
<h3>The Dreadful Sleeping Sickness; Prevention Methods Worth Noting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 10th] The dreadful sleeping sickness has struck students at the Chengdu Military Academy, and some have already died from it. This reporter interviewed Bai Xin, the military academy's doctor, who explained the causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention methods as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Types: This disease has two types: (A) and (B). Type (A) is scattered in Europe and the United States and is rarely epidemic. Type (B) is further divided into Saint Louis (B) type and Japanese (B) type. The former is prevalent near Saint Louis City in the United States, while the latter is prevalent in Japan, China, and India. The pathogens, pathological anatomy, and epidemic situations are generally the same, but the mortality rate of the former is 20%, while the latter is higher, about 60% to 70%. The mortality rate is even higher for the elderly and children. The current outbreak at the military academy belongs to the latter, namely Japanese (B) type epidemic encephalitis.</p>
<p>(2) Pathogen and Transmission: This disease was discovered in Saint Louis City in the United States in 1933. The pathogen is a filterable virus, with a size of about 20 to 30 millimicrons. It multiplies in living cells and cannot survive in culture media. The vector of transmission is mosquitoes, and intermediate hosts include horses, sheep, and rabbits. However, people under 45 years of age are more likely to be affected. Transmission occurs more frequently in the summer, and there are more cases outside urban areas than in cities. The incubation period is 4 to 21 days.</p>
<p>(3) Symptoms: According to the severity of clinical symptoms, it can be divided into three categories: (1) The first category is the most serious of the three, with no prodromal symptoms. It suddenly develops high fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, stiffness of the forehead, and other symptoms. Clinical examination shows Kernig's sign positive, motor ataxia, disappearance of abdominal wall superficial reflexes, enhancement of deep reflexes, paralysis of eye muscles, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased globulin and glucose, and increased number of cells. (2) The second category mainly involves symptoms such as headache, fever, abdominal pain, and discomfort. Occasionally, there are also cases of sore throat and conjunctivitis. (3) The third category has extremely mild symptoms, with only headache and mild fever, and no changes in cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
<p>(4) Diagnosis: Diagnosis can be made based on clinical symptoms and examination of cerebrospinal fluid, such as increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased globulin and cell count, etc. The most accurate diagnostic methods are neutralization and complement fixation tests.</p>
<p>(5) Treatment and Prognosis: There is no specific treatment. The main treatment is symptomatic. Patients should be moved to a well-ventilated room and avoid stimulation such as sound and light. Pay attention to nutrition. If necessary, nourishing enemas and nasogastric feeding can be administered. Inject 50% glucose solution and physiological saline into the patient. Do not give sedatives. To relieve meningeal irritation symptoms and reduce cerebrospinal fluid pressure, cerebrospinal fluid can be drawn. In addition, attention should be paid to the occurrence of complications.</p>
<p>(6) Prevention: The most effective method is preventive inoculation, but unfortunately, this country does not have this vaccine and cannot implement it. The general preventive measures are to isolate patients, vigorously implement mosquito control, and use DDT to eradicate mosquitoes in the affected areas. In addition, attention should be paid to daily hygiene in clothing, food, housing, and transportation to enhance the body's resistance. In conclusion, the mortality rate of this disease is very high, and there is no special treatment method. Therefore, attention should be paid to the prevention of this disease.</p>
<h3>Fighting the Furious Tide in Haining; A Visit to the Jianshan Seawall Project</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Yang Shusheng</p>
<p>[Our Haining Dispatch, 8th] The "Haining Tide" is famous both domestically and internationally. Before the War of Resistance, every year on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, this ancient county town was always packed with people, and the bustling scene was unmatched by any festival. However, during the War of Resistance, the Qianjiang River bank was ravaged by the enemy and puppet troops, and the seawall was in disrepair for many years, which planted the seeds of a major disaster. After the victory, there were numerous breaches in the Qianjiang River, creating dangerous situations. In order to actively repair the seawall, the authorities organized the "Qiantang River North Bank Emergency Repair Committee" and an engineering office in January of the 35th year of the Republic. In August, it was reorganized into the "Zhejiang Province Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau," with separate engineering offices in Hanghai, Yanping, and Shaoxiao, and actively launched repair work.</p>
<p>Endless Repairs</p>
<p>The Hai'ning County section of the Qianjiang River's north bank seawall is the most dangerous. After more than two years of efforts by the Seawall Engineering Bureau, the following have been completed: (1) Jianshan light railway and quarry, (2) Jue-character stone seawall, (3) Xincang wave barrier, (4) Chenwengang firewood seawall project, (5) Qilimao Tang, Tang, Zhong, and Li character firewood seawall projects, (6) Babao stone seawall project. The wave barrier projects in Mugang, Qilimao, and Chenwengang are currently under repair. The recently completed Jue-character stone seawall and Xincang wave barrier have been damaged again due to the impact of the furious tide. This kind of continuous repair work progresses endlessly, and it holds the safety and happiness of millions of people along the seawall.</p>
<p>Six Rows of Foundation Stones Swept Away</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM on the 7th of this month, we departed from Xiashi and arrived at Yuanhua. Then, hosted by the Seawall Engineering Office, we took a special vehicle to Jianshan. Along the way, we saw that this was the area most severely affected by rice stem borers. Farmers were catching stem borers under the scorching sun, without any signs of fatigue. This kind of enduring and arduous spirit made people feel infinitely moved. When we arrived at Chenjiaogang, the furious tide was surging, and the seawall was rolling away. When we returned to Qilimao, six rows of foundation stones of the wave barrier in the 11th Fort area had been swept away. This kind of shocking news was really enough to make people tremble.</p>
<p>The Jianshan quarrying project is currently proceeding smoothly. On average, it produces 200 tons of stone per day. The stones must use a compressor to control the power of the quarrying machine. Through the power of a large crane, the huge stones are transported to small trains and transported to various construction sites. There are also several tugboats that specialize in transporting crushed stones to Xiaoshao and other places for use.</p>
<p>Construction of Wave Barriers</p>
<p>The focus of the Seawall Engineering Bureau's projects in Haining is now on the construction of wave barriers. The greatest benefit of wave barriers is to prevent collapse, prevent the outflow of sea sand, and make the seawall strong and undamaged. Its main materials are tree trunks and stones. Ocean pine wood with a diameter of about one foot and a length of more than 50 meters is driven into the seabed more than 20 meters using a pile driver, and then thick boards are used to connect and clamp it, and huge stones are placed in the gaps. This kind of project is often destroyed halfway during high tides. However, due to funding constraints, this project is the most important before the ability to build stone seawalls, and the Seawall Engineering Bureau has deep confidence in this.</p>
<p>Workers Work Day and Night</p>
<p>The Seawall Engineering Office's funding is now allocated by the Sino-American Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, limited to 20 billion yuan per month. Therefore, many projects cannot be launched due to funding constraints. They mobilize more than 300 workers every day to work in two shifts, day and night, fighting against the huge waves. This spirit is worth singing.</p>
<p>The sand outside the Haining seawall has completely collapsed, and the furious tide has rushed ashore several times. The "Tide Watching Festival" is coming soon, and it is expected that the 18th day of the eighth lunar month this year will be unprecedentedly lively and crowded. In order to prevent the Haining Tide from being submerged, and at the same time ensure the safety of millions of people along the seawall, this repair project should attract the attention of the public.</p>

<h3>Zhang Bingli Seeking Son Guoliang</h3>
<p>I am a poor and ignorant villager with two sons. My eldest son died early, and my younger son's name is Zhang Guoliang. He joined the army in May of the 34th year of the Republic. After the victory, he was stationed in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, and was reorganized into the 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment, 3rd Reserve Brigade, 57th Division of the Army, as a private first class. I received several letters from him. However, it has been more than two years since I last heard from him, and there is no news. I don't know where he is now, or if he has died for the country. My wife became ill due to missing her son so much and died in July of last year. I am pitifully drifting alone in Shanghai, tasting all the pain of life, barely surviving, and it is difficult for me to live long. I want to meet my son before I die so that I can die in peace. Knowing that your newspaper is enthusiastic about serving the society, I dare to request that this letter be published. If I can get information from his classmates, colleagues, or relatives, even if I cannot repay the kindness in life, I will repay it in death! I wish you peace. Respectfully, Zhang Bingli from Xiangshan, Zhejiang. Contact address: Yongxiang Shop, No. 402, 3rd Section, Zhejiang Middle Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>250,000 Denomination Customs Gold Units to be Widely Issued Starting Next Week; National Bank Authorities Deny Issuing New Currency</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Rumors that "Sun Yat-sen Currency" will be issued on the day the new economic plan is announced, and that the ratio of the new currency to legal tender will be one to four million, and the ratio to the US dollar will be two to one. The reporter specifically asked Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, who said: "There is no such thing. Only Customs Gold Units with a face value of 250,000 will be issued starting next week." He also believes that the timing and conditions for reforming the currency system are not yet ripe. The rumor that the Central Printing Plant is rushing to print new currency is absolutely untrue. He does not know what kind of new currency there is other than legal tender and Customs Gold Units. As for the shortage of banknotes, the responsible party believes that it will gradually improve within a few days. Large banknotes of 5 million yuan have been prepared and will be widely issued throughout the country starting next week, and the printing efficiency has also improved recently. It is reported that the panic over cash on the market has reached its peak, because the price increase is too fast, and the existing denominations of legal tender are not enough to pay. After the 250,000 Customs Gold Units are issued, it can be temporarily eased. However, according to the observation of qualified people, based on the current rate of inflation, in three months, the existing large banknotes may not be able to meet the needs of the market.</p>
<h3>Off-Market Stimulation Strengthens; A Wave of Gains Sweeps Through Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise of Chinese stocks was driven by large investors going long and a cyclical rise in the stock market. The gains gradually expanded in twists and turns. The morning session had already opened the prelude, and the afternoon session intensified the gains. Yong Yarn closed at the limit with a new high of 15,510 yuan, and Meiya also had to open at a premium. More than ten other stocks also closed at the limit.</p>
<p>Initially, due to the dull news about economic reforms, people's minds were slightly stable. Except for the small stock Jingfu, which was affected by the strike and opened at a low level, Yong Yarn debuted at 14,180 yuan. The major investors of Nos. 89, 69, 169, 131, 23, 116, 152, 160, 143, 212, 95, 197, 14, and 117 all entered, rising to 14,800 yuan. At this time, there were many small twists and turns. New purchases of Meiya were eager and the most profitable. Yarn and cloth prices all rose sharply. Nos. 224, 104, 148, 155, 137, 65, and 16 advanced to 15,300 yuan. Rongfeng, Meiya, and other stocks rose to the limit. Nos. 224, 169, 172, 228, 117, 218, and 207 sold off, falling back to 15,050 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram was 6 points, and Nos. 4, 151, 76, 55, and 169 advanced to a new high of 15,350 yuan. Nos. 199, 143, and 224 slightly sold off, closing in the morning at 15,260 yuan. Except for Huochai, Xinyi, Tongyi, Huaxin, Zhongni, and Zhongxing, which closed at the limit, Shangni rose slightly. Meiya, Zhongshen, Xinhe, Neiyi, Rongfeng, and Meilin rose to the limit and then recovered, rising half to one percent along with the other stocks.</p>
<p>The off-market stimulation was even stronger in the afternoon session. Yong Yarn opened at a new high of 15,510 yuan and closed at the limit. Meiya, Xinhe, and 13 other stocks also reached the limit. Yong Yarn's high price had to be increased by 250 yuan. Nos. 207, 99, 134, 148, and 89 sold off at high prices, falling in twists and turns. Meiya retreated from an increase of 10 yuan to within the limit. Yong Yarn also slightly fell back to 15,450 yuan. It is generally speculated that the National Bank's deficit will reach more than 3 trillion. However, people's minds have changed, and buyers have the upper hand. After Nos. 65, 89, and 173 and others re-entered, they had to be increased by more than 200 yuan before closing, finally hovering between 100 and 150 yuan. Meiya was 5 to 10 yuan. Compared with the morning session, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhe, Meilin, Tongyi, Datong, Huochai, Zhongni, Liandi, Zhabei, Zhongxing, Huaxin, Shangni, Xinyi, and Hengfeng closed at the limit. Rongfeng, Huafeng, Jinglun, Xinguang, Zhongshen, Wuhe, Zhongfa, and Xinhua rose slightly. Guohuo, Yuean, and Neiyi were stable. Qin Xing and Shangwu slightly fell back. Off-market, unlisted stocks such as Wenhua, Gongyong, Nanyang, Wuzhou, Huacheng, and Zhongxing were still outstanding, while the rest were mediocre.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Government bonds were also driven up by the stock market yesterday. However, they were slightly fatigued due to initial disappointment. Tongbing opened in the morning at 1.6 million, with a low price of 1.59 million, rising to 1.81 million, and then slightly decreased. Rooms 550 and 552 sold, while Rooms 500, 503, and 360 all entered. About 4 million were traded. Compared with the previous session, A, B, and E each rose by 80,000 yuan, C rose by 120,000 yuan, and D also rose by 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds and Others Drawn for Repayment of Principal Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Easy Credit and Shortage of Cash; Banks Reverse Course and Advance Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's credit situation remained easy, and the market was still extremely short of cash. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a net advance of 226.1 billion yuan in the exchange of bank and money industry bills, reversing the large deficit of recent days. Among them, the Central Bank had a net advance of 60.8 billion, the Bank of China had a net advance of 261.71 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net advance of 146 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net deficit of 476.8 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a net deficit of 301.3 billion, the Postal Remittance Bureau had a net advance of 115.6 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury had a net advance of 109.5 billion. Commercial banks had a large exchange deficit of 254.17 billion and a small exchange deficit of 196.71 billion. Foreign banks had a total net advance of 261.71 billion.</p>
<h3>National Bank's Materials and Finance Committee Discusses Tobacco Purchase and Sale Methods</h3>
<p>The fifth meeting of the Central Bank's Materials and Finance Committee resolved several cases related to the purchase and allocation of materials, the most important of which were the purchase of coal from the Kailuan Coal Mine and the discussion and determination of methods for purchasing and allocating tobacco from the place of origin, at the request of the city's tobacco factories. In addition, technical issues such as the scope of goods to be purchased, the methods for ordering loans, and sales methods were also discussed in detail.</p>
<h3>The Gold Control Bureau Decides Not to Lift the Ban on Using Bills for Collateral</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver, Money, and Trust Industries Association jointly submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, echoing the request of the city's Chamber of Commerce to the Ministry of Finance, believing that the restriction on the use of bills as collateral had failed and requesting a return to the original state of collateral use, expressing their approval and urging the Ministry of Finance to lift the ban to facilitate financial circulation. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, the issue of using bills as collateral is a government policy that cannot be changed temporarily. Recently, due to the shortage of cash in the market, bank drafts have been rampant, and large banknotes have been discounted. Various parties attribute the various difficulties to the restriction on the use of bills as collateral, and they will improve after the shortage of cash improves. Therefore, there is no need to worry. In other words, the use of bills as collateral has a significant effect on suppressing credit expansion. The government will not abandon this important strategy.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee of the Industrial Association Discusses How to Use Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association convened a group meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss how to utilize overseas Chinese capital and self-provided foreign exchange. More than ten people attended, including Tian Heqing, Hong Nianzu, Hu Xiguan, and Guo Yongxi. The following resolutions were made: (1) Utilize overseas Chinese capital and deposits of Chinese citizens abroad and relax the import quotas for raw materials, raw salt, and equipment, but requests for exemptions for domestically produced finished products should not be made. (2) Factories are allowed to settle foreign exchange for reinvestment funds to purchase raw materials and production equipment from abroad. As for the previous concern of the Export and Import Control Committee that the influx of funds after opening overseas Chinese capital and self-provided foreign exchange might flow to the black market, this point is no longer a concern. The Industrial Association also decided to hold a joint meeting with the Import and Export Trade Association and the Industrial Association within a few days to conduct further research and formulate methods for the Export and Import Control Committee to use as reference.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Firm and Brisk Buying; Cotton Cloth Reaches New High Price; Leader's Market Once Hailed 80 Million Outside the Ring</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation, due to favorable environmental news, was heavily traded by Tianjin, Guangdong and other groups. The street itself had a loose and abundant money supply, and buying activity unfolded in the market, leading to a prosperous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, upon opening, immediately jumped to 290 million yuan. Subsequently, due to the improved exchange certificate market and a recovery in exports, and hearing that the Leader's fine cloth was rising, groups from Sichuan and Hankou rushed to buy, pushing the market again to 2.95 billion, expected to close at 3 billion tomorrow, a further increase of 390 million to 420 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Other coarser and finer counts of yarn, due to absorption by both local and external customers, saw a general rise of around 15% to 20%, with 103 transactions completed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, due to rumors that the new economic reform plan would be postponed, led to increased speculation. Furthermore, with continuous dispatches from banks and bureaus, and related materials soaring in price, yarn prices reached new peaks, causing those in the industry, who had been quiet for a long time, to become active, and buying interest in the market suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Twelve-pound Leader's fine cloth, upon opening in the morning, was first aggressively purchased by the northern groups, with local cloth merchants and groups from Xuzhou, Zhaopu, and other places competing to absorb it, causing the market to immediately soar by 2.1 million yuan. Subsequently, with active external capital, the Hankou group also made purchases, with prices rising all the way to a closing price of 74.8 million, a rebound of 5.4 million yuan from the previous day (ultimately, with frequent favorable buying news, the price was further pushed up to 76.5 million, still difficult to acquire. In the afternoon, the market outside the ring once created a rare peak of 80.05 million, but due to the stable pricing of the Textile Construction Company's allocation and ample supply, the result was a call of 77 million yuan.)</p>
<p>In addition, various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings, Trumpet, Sunlight, etc., as well as coarse and fine twills, were also up by 3.5 million to 5.6 million yuan, while other colored cloths and Shilin cloths also saw firmer footing, with 2,040 bolts transacted.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Yarn Sale</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Textile Company, on behalf of the Central Bank, sold four types of cotton yarn, totaling 876 pieces, authorized for purchase by 188 entities, valued at 165,731,000 yuan. Furthermore, the China Textile Company sold nine types of yarn yesterday, authorized for purchase by 470 entities, totaling 1,416 pieces, valued at 289,012,000 yuan.</p>
<p>US Cotton Price Drops</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Due to a US government report stating that this year's US cotton production will be the best in eleven years, the price of US cotton has fallen by $2.50 per bale today, with a continued downward trend. Note that China is a good customer of US cotton.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Exports</p>
<p>The effort to strengthen exports of domestically produced yarn and cloth is becoming increasingly active. In addition to various manufacturers organizing export companies, another 2,500 tons of yarn and cloth will be shipped to Singapore, Hong Kong, Rangoon, and other places within days. This batch of export yarn and cloth is currently being declared to customs. Currently, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and other regions have a strong demand for domestically produced yarn and cloth, with many individual merchants privately carrying yarn and cloth to sell in those regions, generating substantial profits. This has prompted various yarn mills in the city to strengthen shipments there, it is said.</p>
<h3>Production Area Prices Reported High; Goods Owners Holding On; Rice Prices Rise Consistently; Oil Market Sentiment Active, Strong Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market turned bullish again, with firm prices in the production areas. Goods owners were very reluctant to sell and unanimously insisted on raising prices, leading to a rise upon opening. While prices had previously stabilized due to poor sales, the closing price was ultimately driven up by the rise in prices of various external goods. White rice was at 45.5 million, thin-husked rice at 48.8 million, Jiashan's new Xian rice opened at 36 million, and special high-quality japonica rice at 48 million, all rising by 1.5 million to 2 million. The closing market was firm and brisk, with 6,020 piculs arriving yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Soared due to the rise in prices of various external goods. The announcement of the new economic plan was pending, leading to bullish sentiment. Moreover, with loose money supply, buying interest was constant. Old Che flour rose from 17 million to 17.6 million, and Bingchuan closed at 17.1 million, all rising by 1.3 million. Red Bee and Jiancheng were both priced the same as Bingchuan at 17.1 million yuan. Peacock and other miscellaneous flours all rose by 1.3 million to 1.4 million, bran rose by 1.1 million to 1.2 million, and the wheat market did not open.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>All flourishing, because the prices of various goods outside the industry are rising, and customer groups are seizing the opportunity to take in a lot of goods, the sales are active, and the Huangdou oil group is taking in, up 3 million, and the corn has not risen much, and it has increased slightly by one million. Yuanmai Shantou and Qing were actively absorbing, and the price increased by another 3 million yuan. The silkworm beans and mung beans were not selling well to customers, only absorbed by the local street, and each slightly increased by 500,000 to 1 million. Mingguang Hongliang was 24.5 million yuan, and the sesame owners held on and rose by 3 million yuan. The raw kernels from Guangxi had entered and re-raised 7-8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Resumed a violent surge in prices, sentiment was active, and the prices of various goods outside the industry rose, and the factory first opened at a high price, and then the market prices were even higher. Soybean oil rose by 25 million yuan, and raw vegetable oil was 125 million yuan, also up by 25 million yuan, a rise of 20%. Jibao raw oil surged by 26 million yuan, and small cart sesame oil rose by 20 million yuan. Soybean cake followed suit, and the closing price rose by 1.12 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Limited Woolen Cloth Transactions</h3>
<p>Due to seasonal and environmental factors, coupled with no change in the China Textile Company's pricing, the woolen fabric market has been calm recently, with little volatility. In terms of transactions, current fixed and small wholesale sales are limited. Regarding fixed orders, deliveries from Hong Kong are the only imported goods being discussed, with the local city having stopped discussing other imports long ago. Major domestic manufacturers want to accumulate their own stock and sell at favorable prices, not favoring fixed orders. Smaller manufacturers are changing their fixed order policies to collect 80% or 100% upfront, resulting in a very quiet market for fixed orders.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Textile Factories of China Textile Company Reduce Work in Rotation Every Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 10th] Due to the lack of raw cotton and staple fibers, the textile factories affiliated with the China Textile Company in Qingdao are unable to maintain normal production. Starting from the 9th, each factory will reduce work by two days per week in rotation, and has telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters, requesting prompt supply to avoid being forced to shut down completely.</p>
<h3>Closure of Fuel Management Committee; Coal Rationing Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has received an order to close. The committee has scheduled its official closure for the 30th of this month and will establish an office to handle unfinished matters. It is understood that after the committee's closure, the management of coal rations in the city will continue to adopt the current distribution methods. The mine prices for coal mines will also maintain the current pricing and acquisition principles. However, a portion of the coal will be allowed for free transportation and sales by mine operators.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Footing Solid</h3>
<p>Since British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Concord, Jinlong, and Tongfu resumed their attention to this year's Qimen black tea, they are still interested, but ultimately, due to the thinness of existing stocks, coupled with the fact that the goods that the Anhui Tea Company and Zhenhe Tea Shop have been actively transporting to the production areas have not yet arrived here, the process continues to be characterized by supply not meeting demand. Transactions are as sparse as stars in the morning, and the latent power repeatedly obscures the edge, and the market is trending upwards. Its styles are also being exploited for price increases due to rampant money laundering, making the purchase atmosphere more robust. The main force is also taking the opportunity to raise the price, all rising across the board, and the footing is very solid.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Trade Feels Impact After Implementation of Two New Restrictions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, August 9th] According to the Far Eastern Economic Review here, Hong Kong may withdraw from the sterling area due to restrictions imposed by London on trade between its colonies and areas with convertible and semi-convertible currencies.</p>
<p>Two new restrictive orders have recently been implemented. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) From August 3rd, all foreign exchange benefits obtained solely from the export of goods should be converted at the official rate and handed over to the Hong Kong government. However, exports to the United States, the Philippines, Macau, Korea, Japan, China, and the sterling area are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>(2) From July 26th, remittances of British pounds between London and Hong Kong are limited to 500 pounds.</p>
<p>According to the old law, all profits earned from exporting certain goods to hard currency countries should belong entirely to the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Economic Review stated that the new regulations, along with the "temporary restrictions on import licenses" and the control of pound remittances, made it necessary to discuss "whether Hong Kong should continue to be included in the common interests or disadvantages of the pound area."</p>
<p>"There are benefits for Hong Kong, both current and future, after withdrawing from the sterling area. Most economic observers believe that Hong Kong is in fact just a large seaport and should not be included in the sterling area. Moreover, now that trade has gradually decreased, in order to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity, no restrictions should be added."</p>
<p>The article stated: "Hong Kong's banknotes have full pound reserves, and furthermore, Hong Kong has a considerable amount of deposits stored in London after the war, so "although Hong Kong's trade is still insufficient, Hong Kong's foreign exchange income and expenditure can still maintain a balance."</p>
<p>It continued: "The direct impact of the new regulations will be a reduction in Hong Kong's exports to hard currency and semi-convertible currency areas. In the past, this type of trade was profitable because the exchange rate of hard currency against the pound was higher.</p>
<p>Since foreign orders are all calculated in US dollars, importers in Hong Kong can still obtain all of their foreign exchange benefits, so although the Hong Kong dollar still has a considerable position, it is inevitable that the US dollar will become the main currency for Far East trade in the future."</p>
<p>"What makes the development of Hong Kong's trade feel dangerous is especially London's order to restrict import licenses. The policy obviously wants Hong Kong to reduce purchases from hard currency and semi-convertible currency areas, and increase purchases from the sterling area."</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Economic Review concludes on this matter as follows: "Whether Hong Kong can develop its trade under these circumstances is a big question."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] This afternoon, the Chinese basketball team attending the World Games easily defeated Switzerland 42-34 in the playoff at Haringey Arena, where the final rankings of the participating countries were determined. Although the game proceeded slowly, the Chinese players clearly surpassed Switzerland in all aspects of basketball skills and strategy. Today's game was dull and tasteless, with the Chinese team lacking enthusiasm, only shooting when appropriate to maintain the lead. Both teams scored two points each in the first three minutes, after which China gradually increased its lead to 12-4. China's Jiaobao Song shot accurately, scoring a total of eleven points, leading the team's offensive. However, the Swiss players rallied and reduced the Chinese team's lead to only five points, with China leading 25-20 at the end of the first half. At the beginning of the second half, the Swiss team shot quickly, narrowing the difference in score. For only one minute, the Chinese team immediately fought hard, relying on Bao Songyuan and Li Shiqiao's wonderful moves under the basket, scoring three goals. After that, the Chinese team strengthened its defense and scored several goals to maintain its leading position in the first victory in this third-group elimination round. There will be no game tomorrow, and the Chinese team will play against the British team on the afternoon of the 11th. If China defeats Britain, it will play against Egypt on the 12th.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Championship; The Last Four Teams are Produced; South Korea Loses to Mexico</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, World Games Venue, 9th, United Press] The fast-paced Mexican basketball team soundly defeated the seemingly tired Korean team tonight. Mexico won 42-32 and will face the winner of the match between the United States and Uruguay on the evening of the 11th. The tall Mexican team galloped swiftly, and the Korean team was unable to control the opponent's shots. Although the battle was brave and exciting, it was hopeless. When Mexico was leading 41-25, only a small half of the time was left. The Korean team's forward Li Caixun successively took two long-range shots, forcing it to 41-31. The Mexican team, known for its short, nimble, and well-trained Korean team, made every effort to deal with it and completely froze it in the remaining time, neither easily attacking nor allowing the ball to easily fall into the hands of the enemy team, aiming to waste time. Although the audience hissed and applauded, the Mexican team was determined to defend its position and win. The only scoring opportunity for the Korean team was in free throws.</p>
<p>[United Press, Haringey, 9th] The Mexican basketball team defeated the short Korean team 43-32 on the 9th. The Korean team gave its all despite the inevitable defeat, and its spirit is commendable. Before the end of the game, the Mexican team was leading 41-25. In just a few minutes, Korea actually chased to 32-43.</p>

<h3>India and Britain Decide on Hockey Champion</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, 10th Broadcast: The hockey competition has entered the final stage. Britain defeated Pakistan in the semi-finals and is scheduled to compete with India for the championship on Thursday evening at Wembley.</p>
<p>This is the eighth time that India and Britain have met in the finals. Since 1908, the battle between Britain and India for dominance has become a tradition. This time, Pakistan was full of hope and originally planned to break the previous eight-session convention and seize the right to compete with India in the finals, but fate did not favor people. Before the game, it rained heavily, and the field was slippery, which caused the Pakistani strongmen, who were accustomed to fighting on hard ground, to lose a lot of their color. Although they were able to barely maintain a tie in the first half, they were gradually controlled by the British athletes, who were in the same company as the low pressure, and scored two goals one after another, making the hope of a Sino-Indian duel a pie in the sky.</p>
<p>In this competition, India defeated Austria 8-0, defeated Argentina 9-1, overwhelmed Spain 2-0, and defeated the Netherlands 2-1 to enter the final. In total, they scored 24 goals and lost 2 goals.</p>
<p>Britain's defense is extremely strong, and it has been able to maintain a great record of not losing a single goal in four games. Britain won the first game against the United States by 11 goals, the second game against Afghanistan by 8 goals, the third game against Switzerland was a hard battle, with no records for each, and the fourth game defeated Pakistan by 2-0.</p>

<h3>International Basketball Cold War Ends; European Basketball Championship in Minnesota; Soviet Union Invites to Moscow; Basketball Association Meets to Discuss Germany's Participation in the Competition</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, 10th Broadcast: The Soviet Union's "Cold War" with the International Amateur Basketball Association has ended on Tuesday. The Basketball Association has received a suggestion from the Soviet Union that the next European Basketball Championship in 1949 be held in Moscow. Today, three uninvited guests, led by Soviet hero Beck Guanov-Riff, suddenly arrived and participated in the ongoing Basketball Association Congress, surprising everyone. The person in charge of the Basketball Association regarded this move as a symbol of the opening of the Soviet sports iron curtain, which was "extremely pleasant."</p>
<p>The current urgent task of the Basketball Association Congress is the reform of the rules. It is generally speculated that the General Assembly may vote to decide whether to simplify the ball rules along the lines of the United States' improvements over the past twelve years. For example, in the World Games competition, after each middle basket, the player must wait for the referee to touch the ball before continuing the game. The new rule will be changed to allow the player to immediately serve the ball from outside the boundary after the ball enters the basket to save time. The issue of player substitution will also be changed to unlimited.</p>
<p>Regarding fouls, in order to make the game more compact, it is planned to re-modify the regulations. "Non-unfair contact" will be allowed by the new rules. The so-called unfair impact refers to the act of deliberately touching the opponent's players with hands or kidneys. However, physical contact with the opponent's player when shooting back is not counted as a foul. In addition to the revision of the rules, the members' charter, legal issues, financial issues, competition system, and amateur qualification issues are all within the scope of the meeting.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Basketball Association is now seeking to enable Germany to participate in international competitions. It is difficult to hope to be recognized before the whole issue of Germany is resolved, but most countries will not object to the German basketball team participating in the competition. The Basketball Association Congress will continue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and is scheduled to end on Friday.</p>

<h3>World Games Athletes – Sex Verification</h3>
<p>International Amateur Athletic Federation to Discuss</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] The International Amateur Athletic Federation, currently holding a conference here, discussed the issue of gender verification for athletes participating in future World Games. The federation's women's committee proposed that every athlete participating in the World Games henceforth carry a physician's certificate upon arrival. All athletes should undergo a medical examination by a physician before the opening of the World Games or before participating in medal events. To date, no cases of men and women being confused have occurred at the World Games. This suggestion merely expresses a concern that unforeseen incidents may occur if precautions are not taken.</p>

According to Moscow Radio broadcasts, a female athlete threw the discus a distance of 185 feet and 2 inches, exceeding the world record for men's discus throw by about five feet. Could it be that a 'rubber band measuring tape' is also being used as a weapon in the 'Cold War'?" Postponed to August 16th</p>

<h3>London's Poor Weather Does Not Diminish Audience Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Following four days of heavy rain, the most severe August storm in Britain in recent years has replaced the World Games and the Berlin crisis as the main topic of conversation. The storm caused considerable damage along the southeast coast yesterday. Although it has been raining continuously for three or four days after the start of the World Games, the British people and spectators from various countries who have traveled from afar are still braving the rain to attend. World Games athletes from various countries have made amazing performances under difficult conditions, setting twelve new records. American athletes won seventeen championships in thirty-three events, leading the field. Ticket revenue for the first week of the World Games has exceeded 400,000 pounds, which is more than the total revenue of 360,000 pounds for the Berlin World Games. Over 60,000 spectators arrived at Wembley Stadium, and including those attending swimming and other events, the total number of spectators in the first week was approximately 800,000. Officials expect the total number of spectators attending all events to increase to one million.</p>
<h3>Henan Refugee Students Petition the Ministry of Education, Requesting Improved Relief Treatment. The Issue of School Placement Cannot Be Resolved Immediately. Will Petition the Executive Yuan for a Fundamental and Proper Solution.</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report, Nanjing, 10th] On the 9th and 10th, over a hundred students from the Central Plains Institute of Technology of Henan, Zhonghua College, and Commercial College petitioned the Ministry of Education, requesting to be assigned to various universities. Because permission had not been granted, they lingered and refused to leave. On the 10th, over a thousand students from Kaifeng Zhonghua Middle School, Zhengzhou Middle School, Su County Middle School, and Suining Middle School arrived at the ministry to request improved relief treatment and school placement. The Ministry of Education has already addressed the issue of improving relief treatment. However, due to practical difficulties, the issue of school placement could not be resolved immediately and the students finally left at 1 PM. At the time, some students prevented ministry staff from leaving, so the police department sent officers to persuade them, and they eventually dispersed. According to ministry officials, regarding higher education, the schools to which these petitioning students belong have not yet been formally registered, but the ministry is providing them with uniform shelter and relief. However, enrollment requires academic ability. Of the 16,000 candidates for China University, only one-tenth were admitted. Nine-tenths of the local students failed. Following this precedent, how can the Ministry of Education force universities to unconditionally accept refugee students? Regarding secondary education, they stated that the sources of middle school students are complex. Some graduated in 1945, while others have no documentation. In addition, order has been restored in many areas, and those who can return to their hometowns. Logically, the education departments of each province should be responsible for recalling the students from their respective provinces. This is a social problem that the Ministry of Education cannot handle alone. In addition to striving to provide relief within its responsibilities, the Ministry of Education plans to submit a proposal to the Executive Yuan and consult with relevant ministries to develop a fundamental and proper solution for the entire future of this matter.</p>

<h3>The Southward Migration of the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology</h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the current situation, the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology has relocated south to Wuxian to resume classes. With the active preparation of the school authorities, enrollment will begin soon. The school was originally located in Zhongzhou and was founded to meet the needs of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine. It was established by people with aspirations, and those outside the area may not be familiar with it. Here is a brief introduction to the school's history for the reference of those who are concerned about it.</p>
<p>Origins of the Founding: On March 1st, before the founding of the Republic of China, the British Fuzhong Company fulfilled its contract and established the Lu Mining School in Jiaozuo. In 1919, it established a specialized undergraduate program and was renamed Fuzhong Mining College. In 1923, to adapt to the school system, it was renamed Fuzhong Mining University. It was not until 1935 that it adopted its current name.</p>
<p>The original campus was in Jiaozuo, Henan. In October 1937, the Japanese invaders went south along the Pinghan Railway. When Anyang fell to the enemy, the situation became critical. The school moved west to Chang'an, and then to Tianshui. In the autumn of 1938, it was ordered to merge with the Engineering Colleges of National Northwest University and Northeast University to form the National Northwest Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Process of Re-establishment: In October 1945, the school was approved to be re-established and resumed classes in Luoyang the following year. Unexpectedly, in August 1947, Hebei reported danger, and Luoyang was in imminent danger. To respond to the changing situation, the school moved to Zhengzhou and found a temporary campus, where it resumed classes in October of the same year.</p>
<p>The school has graduated a total of fifteen classes over the years, with a total of more than 300 students. Before the war, it established two departments: Mining and Metallurgy, and Civil Engineering. The graduates have served in various mines and have been able to uphold the school's original good traditions, be loyal to their duties, work hard, and achieve many successes, which have been praised by people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Current Situation of the School: There are 25 faculty and staff members serving at the school. There is one class of Mining and Metallurgy students in the second year, one class of Metallurgy students, one class of Mining and Metallurgy students in the first year, and one class of Metallurgy students, with a total of more than 150 students.</p>
<p>Due to the many misfortunes in the Central Plains, and Zhengzhou being in a precarious state, the school had to relocate again. The president of the school, Zhang Qinglian, and professors Li Shantang and Zhang Jinghuai have all arrived in Wuxian to survey the campus so that classes can be resumed on time next semester. According to professors at the school, there are many universities and independent colleges in the southeastern provinces, including Taiwan, but none have the departments of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering. From this perspective, the southward migration of the school is in fact necessary for the local environment. It not only reduces the hardship of young people who aspire to study mining and metallurgy but also contributes to the training of talents needed during the period of national construction and to the detailed investigation of mineral deposits in the southeast, so as to lay the foundation for future development.</p>

<h3>On "The Fittest"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>In the hour before the overthrow of the imperial system, some people thought that disobeying imperial orders was simply unthinkable; in the hour after the overthrow of the imperial system, obeying imperial orders immediately became equally unthinkable. These people were most opposed to the revolution; when the revolution succeeded, they were the most supportive of the revolution. Such people are what Darwin called "those who are good at adapting to the environment," now simply referred to as "the fittest."</p>
<p>When a "fittest" person sees injustice on the road, he will never express righteous indignation. Instead, he is very realistic. According to his observations, the weak always suffer. So, he resolves to do things that cause injustice; when a "fittest" person is beaten, he cannot be angry. He only envies the person who beat him and resolves to work hard to put himself in a position where he can legally beat others.</p>
<p>The "fittest" are the most knowledgeable of etiquette and law-abiding. Anyone who dares to disobey social etiquette and laws, who is not afraid of being shot by people, is either a heinous bandit or a superhuman sage, or else a combination of bandit and sage—a revolutionary. The so-called revolution is nothing more than using the means of a bandit to accomplish the mission of a sage.</p>
<p>Today, some people are doing things that are condemned by God and man, and their experiences are as if they have performed some great feat; some people are law-abiding and self-respecting, but their experiences are as if they have done many things that are condemned by God and man. The "fittest" are the most alert. In view of this, they are well aware of their own interests and know what to follow and what to avoid. He knows that being a bandit is too dangerous, being a sage is not worthwhile, and engaging in revolution is both unprofitable and dangerous. He chooses the most practical, stable, legal, and safe road to prosperity. He becomes another combination of bandit and sage—a national gentry. The so-called national gentry are those who use the means of a sage to accomplish the mission of a bandit, and the "fittest" are the most adept at using legal means to rob others of their property.</p>
<p>The "fittest" look down on those stubborn elements who refuse to adapt to the environment. When they see the latter, they feel amused, disgusted, and uncomfortable. They regard them as useless and stupid, and even think that they have committed a heinous crime. But if you treat him the way he treats others, then the "fittest" immediately becomes a sage.</p>
<p>The "fittest" are the most aware of the big picture. They firmly believe that eggplants have a fixed size, chickens and ducks can only walk on the ground, and peach blossoms must bloom in the spring. Once they see an eggplant that is larger than the average eggplant, they cannot help but see it as strange and must immediately pick it off and destroy it; when they see chickens and ducks soaring into the sky, they first mock them, then rebuke them. If the other party is still unrepentant, he shoots them. The hero Gandhi was shot down. The peach blossoms in winter, witnessing this situation, dare not bloom early. And the "fittest" are always the most timely. Anyway, the life he lives is always winter.</p>
<p>From the point of view of his "following the crowd," the "fittest" is a bit like a mediocre person, but in fact, the "fittest" is by no means a mediocre person. They are the so-called "sages of the times." H.L. Mencken called them "second-rate people," but these people are really the backbone of society. Only those who refuse to join the "Fittest Association" are mediocre people. Today's world is a world of second-rate people, and the second-rate talents of second-rate people are naturally most appreciated by the second-rate world. So, those outside this association are like turtles lying on their backs, inevitably killed by second-rate fools for food.</p>
<h3>What I Know About Wu Qingyuan (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>After Qingyuan arrived in Japan, he became a student of Seyama Kensaku. He was fifteen years old at the time. Seyama was extremely pleased with him and wanted to give him the rank of 4-dan. Honinbo, on the other hand, only intended to give him the rank of 2-dan. Later, Honinbo, Iwasawa, Suzuki, and Seyama, all 7-dan, and Katsu, Onoda, and Iwamoto, all 6-dan, jointly examined him, and only then was Qingyuan's 3-dan rank formally recognized. Here, I must briefly describe the origins of the Japanese go schools and the go institute. Japanese go has two schools: the Honinbo School and the Hoshukai School. The Honinbo School is the school of Honinbo Shuho. The Hoshukai School is led by Hirose Hirajiro and Seyama Kensaku. The so-called "dan" in Japan, such as the difference between 3-dan and 4-dan, is only half a komi in strength. The same is true between 7-dan and 8-dan. It has never been very strict. The strength of 3-dan and 4-dan may be completely equal. Since the reorganization of the Honinbo School and the Hoshukai School into the Go Institute, with Makino Nobuaki as the president and Okura Kihachiro as the vice-president, the go affairs and the examination of the qualifications of each dan in the institute were decided by Honinbo Shusai, Suzuki Yoshijiro, and Seyama Kensaku. It was only then that everything was strictly enforced, with no room for leniency. This time, Seyama's desire to give Qingyuan 4-dan was not a personal matter. Qingyuan's first game in Tokyo was against Fujiwara 4-dan. Fujiwara was one of the mainstays of the Japanese Go Institute, and Qingyuan actually won by resignation, which shows that he really had the strength of 4-dan. Although he was suppressed to 3-dan when he entered the Go Institute this time, Qingyuan was able to live up to his teacher's (Seyama) expectations. From 1928 to 1941, that is, from Qingyuan's fifteenth to twenty-seventh year, in just thirteen years, with two years in the middle suffering from anemia and not playing a single game, he was able to rise from 3-dan to 8-dan, which only a genius could achieve.</p>
<p>Lord Yi Yun said in his article "Also Talking About Wu Qingyuan": "It is extremely regrettable that Wu Qingyuan's genius was recruited by Japan." However, if Qingyuan had not gone to Japan, his go skills would have at most reached the level of 5-dan and he would not have become famous as the first master. Even if China had Fan Xiping now, Qingyuan could only study and practice with him, sticking to the old methods, and his achievements would not be able to fulfill his genius. This is because Chinese go and Japanese go have different paths. When we look at the go scores of Shi (Xiangxia) and Fan, almost every game has a close combat battlefield. Japanese go does not advocate melee combat. From beginning to end, they win in the virtual space. If Shi Fan were to come back to life, they would also study Japanese go and not specialize in the old methods. Among the Chinese national players of the past, only Huang Longshi had the style of Japanese go.</p>
<p>In 1923, I saw Qingyuan playing go with others in the Chunming Hall of the Central Park in Beiping. Qingyuan was only ten years old at the time, with two small braids on his head, and his moves were already amazing. Later, he played with the Japanese, but I did not have the opportunity to watch. However, I know many go friends. What I have recorded above is obtained from many sources, and I am confident that it is a true record.</p>
<h3>Coincidence</h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>There are indeed many coincidences in the world, but if we analyze each coincidence, the proportion of true coincidences is probably still very low. The various coincidences arranged by film screenwriters and novelists to accommodate the twists and turns of the plot are of course criticized by those who have a little common sense. Even the real events that appear in news or special reports may have other reasons for their coincidences. Here are two examples to illustrate.</p>
<p>The first example is about a popular hairstyle for women. A female student at an American university once visited a coin exhibition hosted by Mr. Blanc, a collector of American coins, and discovered that the hairstyle of Queen Victoria engraved on a rupee minted by the British East India Company in 1840 was exactly the same as hers. She thought it was a great coincidence in the world and kept marveling at it. Little did she know that the president of the "American Hair Style Design Academy" had gone to Blanc's place to take coins engraved with women's images as a reference and as a blueprint for designing new styles. The hairstyle design of the university student was originally based on coin engravings, and it was not really a coincidence.</p>
<p>Another example involves the American drug dealer and murderer, Lanpuk Butchuerto. This person committed many evils, and the American police authorities pursued him very severely, but they have not yet been able to capture him. One day, Walter Winger, a famous American radio commentator, broadcast from the radio: "Lanpuk, can you hear the broadcast? No matter where you are, come forward!"</p>
<p>As a result, Lanpuk actually came forward. He surrendered to Walter Winger and FBI Director Ejia Hoover at a dark street corner in Manhattan, New York, causing a sensation across the United States. How could a cultural figure with no power and no courage be able to inspire a bandit to surrender and confess his guilt? According to people familiar with the matter, Lanpuk's surrender was due to the assurance of Kousterlau, the head of the underworld society, who is known as the number one mysterious figure in the United States. The authorities put pressure on Kousterlau, forcing him to hand over Lanpuk, otherwise it would be detrimental to him. As for Lanpuk surrendering after Winger's broadcast, it was just a deliberate deception. Later, Lanpuk was sentenced to death by electrocution. Before his execution, he cried loudly, cursing Kousterlau for betraying his friends.</p>
<p>Having read many similar records, the author cannot help but feel suspicious about many coincidences in the world, such as someone winning the first prize in a store's shopping lottery, or a certain master always maintaining the top position in a foreign competition. Perhaps due to age, I have a deeper understanding of the ways of the world.</p>
<h3>Giant Diamond</h3>
<p>This is the pink giant diamond discovered by Canadian geologist Dr. Williamson in Africa in 1941, weighing 54 carats. When Princess Elizabeth of England got married, Williamson dedicated this diamond as a wedding gift. After three months of polishing, it has become the largest and most crystal-clear diamond in the world, weighing 23.6 carats net. In May of this year, this diamond was exhibited publicly in London for the first time. The picture shows the photo taken when the polishing was not yet completed, courtesy of the British News Office.</p>
<h3>Ramblings on the Double Seventh Festival</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Time flies, and it is the Double Seventh Festival again. Du Mu's poem "Autumn Evening" says: "Silver candle shines, the autumn light chills the painted screen, Light silk fan chases the fireflies. The heavenly steps, the night so cool, like water, Lying down, I watch the Herd Boy and the Weaving Girl star." It is well-known, and Li Shutong used it as a new song, making it even more immortal.</p>
<p>Bai Xiangshan's poem on the Double Seventh Festival says: "Smoke in the clouds, the moon is faint in the long sky, The autumn meeting of the Silver River is the same for all ages. How much joy and sorrow? Every year they are all in this night."</p>
<p>Meng Dongye has an ancient poem that says: "The Weaving Girl star is by the river, the Herd Boy is on the bank, Unable to cross the clear and shallow water, they look at each other from afar." It is indeed a satire.</p>
<p>Since the Double Seventh Festival is the auspicious time for the meeting of the two stars, the separated and the poets especially feel sad, as in Meng Haoran's poem "Double Seventh Festival in Another Land": "Meeting the Double Seventh Festival in another land, the inn adds to the sorrow of travel. I do not see the women threading needles, but only think of the ancestral home buildings. The beginning of the breeze lessens the heat, the new moon begins to descend on autumn. Who can bear to peep at the Milky Way? Far away, I gaze at the Dipper and the Ox." On the first day of the seventh month, there are those who sell "Qiao Guo" (skillful cakes) in the market, and they worship the two stars on the Double Seventh Festival to beg for skills. On the eve of the seventh day, they fill a cup with mandarin duck water, scoop up dew from the courtyard and mix it in, and dry it in the sun until the next day. When a film forms on the surface of the water, each person takes a small needle, throws it into the water to make it float, and then examines the shadow of the needle at the bottom of the water to test their intelligence.</p>
<p>The Jingchu Sui Shi Ji (Record of Customs of the Seasons in Jingchu) says: On the Double Seventh Festival, women string seven-holed needles with colored threads and display melons and fruits in the courtyard to beg for skills. If there is a magpie web on the melon, it is considered a good omen.</p>
<p>The Zhixu Ge Zazu (Miscellaneous Records from Zhixu Pavilion) says: On the Double Seventh Festival, Xu Jieyu carved lotus roots into strange flowers and rare birds, and arranged them on a crystal plate to present to the emperor. They were extremely exquisite, and the emperor praised them greatly, bestowing countless treasures. The emperor looked at them all day long, his joy indescribable. At dusk, the emperor scattered them himself on the tables in the palace, and ordered the palace women to take them secretly, with the one who took the most exquisite silk as the winner, calling it "fighting for skill" to bring laughter. On the eighth day of the seventh month, Xue Yaoying ordered all the maids to cut light silk together and make more than a thousand pairs of connected flowers, dyed them with sunstone, and scattered them in the courtyard at noon. They rose with the wind, covering the sky like five-colored clouds, and disappeared after a long time, calling it "crossing the river auspicious flowers" to beg for skills.</p>
<p>The women of Guangdong beg for skills every year on the evening of the sixth day, burning incense and candles. In addition to preparing melons and fruits, there is also a kind of "Double Seventh Basin" made of paper, which is not found in other places. The Guangdong native goods shops in Shanghai sell it.</p>
<p>The people of Chaoshan worship the bed god and bed goddess on the morning of the seventh day, burning incense and candles on the bed. They do not do it in the evening, which is also a custom.</p>
<h3>Lingyun Terrace</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>The Yingzao Fashi (Building Standards), a specialized work on architecture from a thousand years ago, contains a table of material weights, such as: "Every cubic inch of various stones weighs two mace and three candareens." This must refer to several commonly used stone materials, not to arbitrarily adjust the weight of stones. It also says, "Every cubic inch of white pine wood weighs three candareens and two fen," which is credible. In the past, Emperor Wen of Wei built the Lingyun Terrace, from the building rafters to the ground, it measured thirteen zhang, five chi, seven cun, and five fen. The Shishuo Xinyu (A New Account of the Tales of the World) records the event, saying, "The buildings on the Lingyun Terrace were exquisite. First, the weights of all the wood were measured, and then they were constructed, so that there was no discrepancy. When the terrace was raised, it was difficult to make it tall and steep. It often swayed with the wind, but it never collapsed. When Emperor Ming of Wei ascended the terrace, he feared that it was dangerous and used large timbers to support it, and the building immediately collapsed. Commentators said that this was because the weights were biased." People say that a tall building that sways in the wind must be a good structure, and those who live in it feel at ease. Those that do not sway at the same time are often not guaranteed to be safe in the face of stronger winds. The building on the Lingyun Terrace was probably not very tall in itself, and it was built of wood, so it could not last long. Buddhist pagodas are built of layers of stones, and their lifespan is longer. Today, the Longhua Temple Pagoda in Shanghai is showing signs of tilting, but it still has no tendency to collapse. Although the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou is peeling off, if there were no stone thieves, it would still stand tall today. Zhou built the swirling chambers and tilting palaces, but what they were like, there is no way to know.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The extremely brutal "weapon of destruction" has a surprisingly beautiful name, called "weapon of peace." The originator of this idea had existed for a long time. The Italian Marconi, who succeeded in wireless radio, had considered several "weapons to eliminate war." The American John Hays also said, "The more brutal the weapons, the more people will fear war, which can guarantee peace." Such statements are quite similar to what ancient Chinese sages said, "Establishing power to quell nascent threats," "Using warfare to stop warfare," and "Stopping war is true martial valor," and they are not entirely without reason.</p>
<p>Marconi's ideas were: (1) A destructive mirror, creating a giant convex lens to focus sunlight on one point. Using the heat from this point to reflect onto the enemy army, turning millions of troops into ashes in an instant, melting large ships and heavy artillery, and reducing strongholds and fortifications to scorched earth. (This method may have been inspired by using a convex lens to take fire from sunlight to light cigarettes.) (2) Wireless radio passing through enemy lines, causing them to tremble and collapse, paralyzing and killing them. (3) Terrifying colors, confusing the enemy's emotions, causing them to collapse without a fight. (How does this compare to the disastrous cutting off of water supply at Jieting?) (4) Terrifying rays, reflecting onto the enemy army, causing shock and confusion, also leading to "collapse without a fight," and moreover, "stiffening without being struck." (Even the Golden Light Mother in the Investiture of the Gods could not surpass this.) The above are just "ideas," without any "doing," let alone a successful "device," or any "military experimentation." Marconi was probably too happy with the miraculous effects of wireless radio, so he indulged in his "dream of invention." Hays' words, however, were not mere empty talk. He had created a type of high-heat bomb, far more powerful than German artillery shells that could attack strongholds but could not spread and melt. During the spring of 1945, when American warships approached the Japanese coast, using cannons to bombard the shore, and fires broke out, the Japanese firefighters who went to rescue them were immediately killed. This was the type of shell used, but it was ultimately not as effective as the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>To say that a "weapon of destruction" is a "weapon of peace" is admittedly an exaggeration, but at the end of World War II, the Japanese army gathered a million elite troops to defend their homeland to the death. The plan had already begun to be implemented, and the so-called "cornered beast fighting" was a possible reality at the time. Roosevelt's prediction of the final occupation of Japan was in the summer of 1946. If it were not for the serious warning of the atomic bombs, the war would have been extended by half a year, and the multiple of sacrifices on both sides is unimaginable. Therefore, these two bombs had the effect of shortening the disaster of war.</p>
<p>As for whether the future "atomic" war can rely on the advancement and suppression of "atomic" weapons to make those who understand their strength and know the difficulty wary, and thus maintain peace, it seems that no one can know for sure at this time.</p>
