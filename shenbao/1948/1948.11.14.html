<h3>日本戰犯的宣判</h3>
<p>日本甲級戰犯之宣判程序，迄十二日已終了。根據國際軍事法庭宣讀的判決書，東條英機及其他廿四名個別判決及科刑，其節略已誌昨日本報。我國與論以緊張的脈膊，緊密注意東條等戰犯的科刑，計被判處絞刑的，有東條英機，土肥原賢二，廣田弘毅，坂垣征四郎，木村兵太郎，松悲鳴石根，武藤章七人；被判處無期徒刑的，在荒木貞夫，橋本欣五郎，畑俊六，大島浩，白烏赦夫，島田繁太郎等十六人；被判處二十年有期徒刑的，為東鄉茂德；被判處七年有期徒刑的為重光葵。個別判決的內容，甚少提到日皇裕仁的責任。據法庭庭長威伯於宣判後發表意見說：裕仁應稱作「罪魁」，但他已經獲得免訴的特許了。這是一件具有歷史性的大事件，我們對於這事件的宣告結束，自難感到完全的滿意，復對麥克阿瑟元帥凖備接受被吿减刑的請求，更要感到驚愕與不安。因此我們對於國際軍事法庭所努力追求公平的合理的標準，不能不持懷疑的態度。</p>
<p>遠東國際軍事法庭，自一九四六年四月廿九日正式開始，至本年十一月十二日後判決止，計時已兩年又七個月。如果從國際檢察團於一九四五年十一月六日即開始對日本戰犯進行檢察工作說，現在恰好是三年的時間。三年以前，波茨坦宣言的神聖精神，深為全世界愛好和平的人士所崇敬，三年以來，渡茨坦宣言的正義，逐漸褪色，逐漸變質，甚至連日本甲級戰犯的處斷，也半步　行而逐漸消失其政治意義與法律意義。所差堪令人吿慰者，這次宣讀的判決書長及二千五百頁，材料搜羅豐富，內容敍述完備，不當一部廿年來之太平洋國際關係史，或廿年來日本對外從事侵略戰爭的史實，具有無限的歷史意義，但並非完全的一部壓史。我們雖未獲讀判決書的全文，已經從零星的報道中，發生出一種懷疑的預感，茲分述如下：</p>
<p>第一，關於個別科刑之處斷：根據波茨坦宣言第十條：「對於包括虐待俘虜者在內之一切戰爭犯罪者，必須加以嚴厲處罰」。駐日盟軍總部於一九四六年一月廿五日頒佈審判條例，規定法庭所應審理的罪行有三種：（一）破壞和平罪，卽侵略戰的計劃，準備，開始，實行的罪，（二）違反戰爭法規及慣例最；（三）違反人道罪。至三罪輕重之分，則以第二種罪及第三種罪的直接下手者為丙級戰犯，其直接實任者為乙級戰犯，第一種罪的責任者為甲級戰犯。國際軍事法庭所審判的東條等廿八名（現只有廿五名），全屬甲級戰犯，卽全屬破壞和平罪的直接者。依紐倫堡判決的先例和國際刑法的尺度，日本甲級戰犯槪應科以絞刑及無期徒刑，結果僅東條土肥原等七名判處絞刑，重光東鄉處以有期徒刑，這是超越了公平標準的一種「寬大」。雖然這種鐵的判決，已至無可挽回的地步，可是全世界愛好和平的人類，對於荒木等十六名甲級戰犯之不死，宣在心難干服。</p>
<p>第二，關於裕仁不負戰實問題：日本廿年來的戰事實任，其主導者為裕仁及內府重臣，從理論上事實上說，裕仁及內府重臣，是不能卸辭破壞和平戰責的。裕仁不單是日人的偶像，並且是日本政治上的權威，從裕仁宣布投降一事為證，卽可知其權威的政治地位·盟總特許免訴了裕仁，國際軍事法庭不予追究，說明法庭的審判或多或少受了盟總的支配。這是國際軍事法庭二年多以來辛動努力的一件憾事。內府重臣木戶幸一，為東條內閣的支持者，主持太平洋戰事的計劃，罪惡滔天，竟判處無期徒刑，减輕了木戶破壞和平的罪責，無異對裕仁示以好感，這一點也是人們所不平的。</p>
<p>第三，關於减刑問題：紐倫堡審判的可愛處，是宣判卽執行，概不予以减刑。東京審判的支配者為盟總，它有權核减被吿之科刑，或令延緩執行。關於减刑的弊端，本報本月四日社論已有論列；我們反對採取軍事獨裁的裁決制，以意識變更法律，以喜怒變更法律，以命令變更法律。殊料十二日宣判終了之時，盟總卽宣布準備接受被告减刑的請求，並將邀請管制委員會各國代表會商减刑問題，足徵盟總對於甲級戰犯的减刑，是成竹在胸的。據我們所知，重光東鄉二人將赦免無罪，十六名無期徒刑戰犯，將有一半改為有期徒刑；至七名絞刑者是否將受减刑優待，似尙在未定之天。這種减刑的方法，是違背法律正義的一種惡例，如果錯亂運用，必將招致愛好和平人士的不滿；這無異是優容甚至鼓勵侵略。我們希望管委會各國代表曁盟總主管要以嚴謹的態度處理之。玩火者可為火焚，歷史的慘痛敎訓，難道不够令人警惕麽？</p>
<p>以上三點，是我們對於東京審判宣判吿終後所發生的一種感想，也是今天全世界愛好和平人類對法律尊嚴所持的懷疑態度·希望盟總主管曁管委會各國代表，正視人類和平正義的巨大反響！</p>

<h3>敬告電報電話用戶</h3>
<p>— 馬牧</p>
<p>前綫軍事緊張，限價政策放棄以後，市塲波動劇烈，物價漲勢逼人。在這個局面下，電信局的電報電話就像潮湧般增多了若干倍。工作量早已達於極度。電信局的各部門工作人員雖無片刻停留，還是不能淸掃大量壓積下來的電報電話。我們自然感覺到平日沒有把人手和設備發展到充裕的程度，但我們自信在業務特別煩忙的時候，能够忍勞負重，盡最大的努力。國步艱難，大局動盪，電信傳輸在這個時代中顯得異常的重要，電信從業員尤其不能絲毫鬆懈。我們站在崗位上辛勤工作，日以縱夜，但也希望用戶們瞭解目前工作上若干困難，請賜予更多的合作。</p>
<p>首先，上海和徐州蚌埠間的來去報最近因軍電增繁，每不能於規定時限內到達，原因是上海和該二地往來的電報，中間須經過南京電信局的接轉，京局不幸在八日那天大火，工作曾一度停頓，目前正在急速淸理，在傳遞的時間上難免有所延稽。</p>
<p>其次，來去報以往是由電信局代為譯妥的。但是報務一多，人手仍屬有限，就有難以應付之感。我們希望電報用戶們能够自譯的儘量自譯，在用戶們固然多一步手續，而對於整個電報的傳輸速率來講，有着莫大的便利。</p>
<p>最後，長途電話掛號也是同樣的擁塞，棧路有限依次接通，也偶有超越限時，是難免的事。總之用戶們能够明瞭這些，我們仍舊一貫地努力，來克服當前的困難。</p>

<p>電信局供給用戶裝設電話的設備，在局內，有自動式或人工式的總機，在用戶屋內，有電話機或小交換機，在這兩者之間，有電纜綫路，作為連絡的電話對綫。每一用戶，欲與他一用戶，於電話內作私人談話時，決不願他人干擾，或聽到其言語，所以，每一用戶，必須有綫一對，供其專用。這就與其他公用事業，如水電煤氣不同，水電煤氣，可以在繁盛的街道上，敷設一總管，供給兩旁用戶的共同應用，而電話綫路，必須將多數用戶對棧，集合成一總纜，自電話交換所，扇形分出，故每一交換所，必有一電纜綫路網，在設立之前，卽須計畫完美。這是電話技術的主要課題，亦卽為裝設電話的根本基礎。</p>
<p>當電話交換所在創辦伊始，首須規定營業區域，這營業區域的大小廣裏，應視當地商業的繁簡，住宅的疏密劃定之，交換所地點，應在營業區的中心，使電纜綫路，四向分佈，各得其距離上的平均，交換所地點確定後，卽須計劃電纜綫路網，這綫路網，務須設計周密，繁盛的街道，應佈設較多心綫的電纜，幽僻的里巷，可佈放細型電纜，或竟用明綫綫路，近來世界各大都市，電話交換所的總機容量均甚多，所用粗型電纜，有心綫多至三千六百條的，卽每一電纜中，可容納一千八百對用戶對綫，普通為</p>
<p>一千二百對，六百對，三百對，二百對，細型的有一百對，五十對，二十五對。裝設在里弄牆壁上的，有細至十五對，十對，五對的。這種電纜心綫，為二十一號硬銅綫，外包紅白色乾性紙，每紅白兩綫為一對，互相紐結，使彼此間，十分絕綠，最外層用鉛皮包裏，製造時，排去內部潮氣，防止漏電，二百對以上的電纜，都裝在地下，用多孔土管，九孔或十二孔，列成管道，埋入路中，每隔相當距離，開一人孔，卽馬路上常見的圓鐵蓋覆置的溝洞，這人孔是電纜的接頭處，相當深闊，修理時，工人們可置身其中，測試及修接綫路。一百對以下的細型電纜，都架設在電桿上，用吊纜鋼繩鐵鈎掛住，電纜最終點，為分綫箱，分綫箱容量，有一百對，五十對，二十五對，由分綫箱起，或用架空銅綫或用皮綫，接通用戶綫至各用戶屋內電話機。所以用戶申請裝機，必先調查綫路，這就是要調查申請地點最近的電纜箱內，有否空綫，假定這分綫相的容量一百對，已裝滿一百號用戶，後來申請的就無法裝機，如要利用較遠分綫箱的空綫，則所需材料旣多，又將多生障礙，維護困難，殊不相宜。上海電信局各自動電話交換所電纜綱，大都用六百對，三百對地下電纜，人工交換所電纜，亦多用一百對架空電纜。至於較長距離，及長途中繼電纜綫略，則用十九號硬銅心綫，加裝負荷綫圈，可以减少通話的傳輸衰耗，這又是技術上的奧妙，將俟另文闡述。</p>
<p>電纜綫路網的設計，實為工程上的艱鉅課題，在設計之先，應調查營業區域內，每一街道上各式房屋內，可能申請裝設電話的用戶數量，並須預測若干年以後的發展程度。再有用戶裝設電話後，其通常每日可能喚打的電話次數，亦須估計，務使局外電纜綫路網，與局內總機數量，相互配合，如此設計，方可稱謂成功。但是精密的計劃往往被時局的演變所打破，卽以上海電信局所轄虹口電話交換所而論，其電纜網，原係日敵華中公司所設計，當時偏重於賽山路以東地區電纜的分佈，均側重於此，乃三年以來虹口區閘北西部以及北部中山路一帶商店住宅，日趨繁茂，電纜空綫每感缺乏擴充發展固在計畫之中，但綫料工程需付鉅款，欲其實現，尙需時日。</p>

<h3>千里傳聲的長途電話</h3>
<p>— 斯繩</p>
<p>（一）最便利的通訊工具</p>
<p>長途電話實在是許多通訊工具中最便利最有效率的一種，無論雙方的距離多遠，只要電信局的綫路伸展到而開放長途電話的地方，便可自由談話，能迅速的達到通話目的，减少時間的浪費，而且使用方法簡單，各階層的人們都能普遍享受。長途電話更有一點好處，它不像其他通訊工具，如書信，電報等，只能作單方面的通訊，它可以使雙方在短期內晤談，把重要的事情當機立斷。所以在社會人事愈來愈複雜的今天，長途電話貢獻了輝煌的效果，不單使大家樂用，而且成為人類日常生活上不可或缺的工具了。</p>
<p>（二）長途電話的掛號手續</p>
<p>如果時常在利用長途電話的人們，並且已經裝有市內的，最好請到電信局去預存長話費。預存的數目，是依照一個月內所發的長話次數多少來決定。辦過這種手續以後的用戶，發話的時候，不必再跑到營業處去掛號，祗要撥一個電話就行。上海電信局的用戶，請撥一三號電話，上海電話公司用戶，請撥〇三掛號，吿訴記錄台關於你本人的電話號碼，受話人的姓名住址和通話種類。等到長途台上記錄完畢，校對沒有錯誤，接綫員會者訴你大概的接通時刻，然後靜待通話。在通話以後，也不必立刻付話費，到了月底，電信局會把你在這一個月裏所發的長途電話，詳列淸單送給你，根據這淸單的結數，到電信局去一次算淸。如果家裏沒有裝用市內電話的，那末祗有到電信局營業處去掛號，先要一張長途電話掛號單，付了話費，挨着次序等候通話，手續上也一樣的方便。</p>
<p>（三）通話種類</p>
<p>長途電話通話的種類，以速度來分，有「普通」，「加急」，「特快」三種。以性質來分，有「呌號」「呌人」「傳呼」三種。所謂呌號通話，是只呌接爾話號碼的通話，例如上海七一六三四呌南京二二〇〇一號沒有指定某某人來接話，只要雙方電話接通，就算通話了。這種電話，大都是大商店或者重要機關常常使用。「呌人」通話是發話人要某地某電話號碼的某一個人來接話，但是恐怕受話人不在，發話人可以預先聲明，如果受話人不在，可以指定另外一個人代表接話。所謂「傳呼」通話，是用在沒有自用電話的受話人的。你要打個電話給外埠朋友，而朋友家裏沒有電話，要當地的電信局派人到朋友家裏去通知，就要這種傳呼電話了。這種電話在手續上較煩，浪費的時間也多，所以定價比較的高。還有一種廉價的夜間通話，如果所發的電話沒有時間性，並且可以在下午十一點鐘後，到次晨七點鐘以前的時間裏通話，就不妨掛夜間電話，話費照原來通話種類的話費七折計算。</p>
<p>（四）怎樣計算次數</p>
<p>長途電話的通話次數，是照開始通話時起，每三分鐘為一次，不滿三分鐘，也得算三分鐘，超過了三分鐘就算二次，至多是三次，換句話說，每次通話就最多談九分鐘了。時間是很寳貴的，所以關於問候客套，不必多說，就是要說，等重要事情談完後，有多餘的時間再說。</p>
<p>（五）納費銷號與免費退號</p>
<p>在申請掛發長途電話之後，因故沒有通話而取銷掛號，倘使實任在用戶方面的，譬如受話人不在，受話人住址錯誤或超出傳掛範圍，以致無法通知，和掛號後在規定的限時內，不願通話等情形，均應繳納銷號費。倘使責任在電信局方面，如機綫臨時發生障礙，而不能接通受話人，或者已呌到受話人而不能同呌到發話人，或因長話擁塞，疏通不及，以致掛號後已超過規定時限尙未接通，不願等候等情形，均作無費退號處理。</p>

<h3>電信常識講話（十四）</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第六講　怎樣計算字數　（續）</p>
<p>洋文明語電文　正和我們通常把非本國籍的人士統統稱做「洋人」一樣，凡是不屬於中國本國各民族所用的文字，我們籠統地把它稱為「洋文」，世界上總共有五十六種文字准許用來繕寫明語電報的電文，每一個國家除開她的本國文字以外，再從這五十六種文字裏面採用全部或選定某幾種文字作為明語電報准用的文字。</p>
<p>各種洋文明語電文，計算字數的方法，假定發報人按照規定書寫，並沒有把幾個拚法比較短的字連成一字意圖取巧省費的話，通常都以每十五個字母當做一個字計算，也就是說，每一個字的拚法的長度如果在十五個字母以內的，一律當做一字計費，超過十五個字母而在三十個字母以內的，就得當做二個字計費。電文裏面如有商務標識或通常習慣使用的各種縮寫字樣，都照每五個字母當做一個字計費，這是洋文明語電文計算報費的基本原則</p>
<p>有些時候，我們可以在來報報頭的字數格裏，看到同時列有兩種字數，例如18/15這就是表示在這張電報裏面，雖則祗寫有十五個字，但是因為裏面或則雜有三個字應該各作二個字計費的字，或則雜有一個該作三個字計費和另一個該作二個字計費的字，或則雄有一個該作四個字計費的字，因此全電需照十八個字收費。所以，我們通常把寫在分數斜劃（/）前面的字數稱做「計費字數」，而把寫在分數斜劃後面的字數稱做「實在字數」，我們在這一節準備談到的是指計算「計算字數」的各種方法，至於實在字數，那祗需要按實有字數計算，方法非常簡單，母庸細談</p>
<p>在世界各國的各種文字裏面，直到目前為止，仍然要推英文最為普遍通用，這是不可否認的事實，；就拿中國來說，不論本國各地間或中國與國外往來的洋文明語電報，用英文書寫的佔絕對多數，這裏，讓筆者把英文明語電文計算計算字數的方法，作一概括的介紹：</p>
<p>（注意）：下面各小節裏所提到的「單字」，就是指每十五個字母作為一字計費，如有超出，每加一個至十五個字母加算一個字的報費，「個別計算」就是指按照這字所含的原來字數個別計算。</p>
<p>（一）韋氏大字典制定的複字和改竄字計算法</p>
<p>一，字典制定的復字（卽在韋氏大字典裏把二個單字用短劃符號連成一字的字，例如把to與day連成to-day這類複字，這類複字祗要把短劃除掉，連接寫成一字如today就能當做單字計算</p>
<p>二，字典制定的改竄字，祗要把略號（Apostrophe）除去，就能當做單字計費，例如把DON'T（=do　not）寫成DON'T，把MUSTN'T（=must　not寫成MUSTNT，都作一個字計算。又表示所有格的字，如果把主有號略去，例如把CHANG'S寫成CHANGS,也可作為一字，但倘使發報人堅特要把上面所略各字的短劃，略號，或主有號拍出，那末電局就要把短劃，略號或主有號前後的字各作一字，並且把這些短劃，略號或主有號符號本身也當做一字，照這樣算法TO-DAY　DON'T　MUSTN'T　CHANG'S等字，每字都須作為三個字計費，當然很不合算。</p>

<h3>伊伐特賴依電四強元首　呼籲解決柏林糾紛　馬卿發表聲明重申美立場</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十三日電〕聯大主席伊伐特與聯合國秘書長賴依今日聯名向美英法蘇四國元首</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十三日電〕安理會主席卽阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞昨夜與蘇代表維辛斯基會議，據勃氏左右稱，兩人曾討論柏林問題。大約勃氏正在起草解決柏林間　糾紛之新方案，但難氏態度如何。則不得而知。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處巴黎十二日電〕國務卿馬歇爾在記者招待會稱，美國依然希望安理會能提出一項建議，俾解決柏林僵局。渠繼稱，西方國家於十月廿七日所表示之立場依然成立。此項聲明重申西方國家願意履行解決柏林僵局之建議，猶如中立國家所曾提出而由蘇聯加以否決者。馬卿謂，美國將繼續維持對柏林空運，並深信其必能成功。馬歇爾對於莫斯科方面暗示杜魯門總統可能與史達林會晤之消息，不予置信，認為此足以顯示蘇聯領袖在聯合國及其他地方，不能使其政策獲得支持而感受之困頓心境。馬歡爾又稱，世界人民應謹防蘇聯之宣傳，渠稱，任何人均希望和平而非和平之宣傳。關於北大西洋安全協定之建議，馬歇爾指出美國與西歐各國所進行之討論原為試探性質，但現已進入比較具體之階段。論及歐洲復興計劃，馬歇爾稱，此事已有重要進展。論及希臘局勢時，馬卿稱，希臘問題為大問題中之一部份，此大問題可於蘇聯封鎖柏林及共黨在中國得勢二事中見之。述及其本人之進很問題，馬歇爾稱，渠本人從未說明其國務卿之任期將於何時結束，在渠與杜魯門總統會商前，將不致發表此種聲明。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十三日電〕馬歇爾頃發表簡短聲明，否認渠已決定於一月二十日辭職。聲明全文如下：『本人今晨閱報，見有稱本人仍「堅持原來決定，准於一月二十日退出內閣」，本人因昨日在記者招待會之言論，竟引起錯誤解釋，無任遺憾。本人以為當時已剴切表示，在未與總統討論前，決不下一決定，總統及本人則至今猶未討論此事』。</p>
<h3>維辛斯基力自辯護　蘇政策志在和平　謂計劃世界革命亦非事實</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十三日電〕聯大政委會今日繼續辯論裁軍問題，蘇聯外次維辛斯基發言，指斥美國正為蘇聯準備另一個「珍珠港」。渠稱，美國人如空軍中將凱尼之流已宣佈其計劃，擬以美國長程轟炸機，自英國基地起飛，携帶原子彈直臨蘇聯上空。是諸君以詭計及不容忍之心情，正圖掀起戰爭，然諸君今日則兌思諉罪於迄未夢想作此之吾人。</p>
<p>渠高呼：「諸君不分晝夜，以製造此猜忌恐懼空氣。諸君躱在法國背後，準備將魯爾區發還給希特勒之臣民，實已一手撕毀國際協定。」英美代表十二日譴責蘇聯阻撓德日和約，維氏答稱「德日和約可能締結，然不應限於一區。波茨坦協定已創立基礎，然諸君不此之圖，竟採擇設立西德以與蘇聯分庭抗禮之道路，而不願整個解決。」關於日本，渠稱，原議解決權力操於外長會議之手，然西方國家則要求召集一切對日作戰國家舉行和會，「由於諸君阻撓其一，致和約無從締結。」維氏否認蘇聯之目約在於世界革命，並引史達林與美名記者霍華德一九三六年在莫斯科會見之紀錄為證。史達林當時吿霍氏稱，「若信蘇聯在計劃世界革命，實愚不可及。任何國家祗須自願，儘可革命，如不願，則大可不必。然若稱吾人擬干涉他國內政而策動革命，則悉屬子虛之談。」渠又稱，「如諸君企圓高呼蘇聯具有野心，而掩護諸君政策之侵略意向，此不啻是哄小孩之天方夜譚故事。吾人之所為，無非為和平着想。」</p>

<h3>參會員工聯名抗議　剩餘物資配售辦法　提理由三點質詢供應局</h3>
<p>物資供應局優先配售本市公敎人員之剩餘物資，最近公吿改變配售辦法後，市參議會秘書處全體員工，昨特聯名具函物資供應局局長江杓，認為該局所謂配售秩序無法維持，實由前此所定辦法未能允當，其咎不在應享權利之公敎人員，而最近改變之十項辦法，又無異將國家給予公敎人員之特別權利，步步限制，重重束縛，此扯現象亟應攷慮糾正。該函最後要求物資供應局今後配售物資，務必體念政府之意旨，以公敎人員福利為前提，善盡職守明辦情理，以慰喁望，茲摘錄原函所列三項理由如下：</p>
<p>限期迫促難於遵辦</p>
<p>（一）查公敎人員為有組織之市民，身份明確，各有機關有編制有長官統馭，配售物資，原可由各機關長官，按月造具名册向貴局辦理領購手續，其事似甚簡單。本市公敎人員配給日用必需品，行之有素，未嘗聞有秩序紊亂，無法維持之現象，乃貴局不此之岡，必欲驅十餘萬公敎人員於每星期六星期日短短之時間內親自擠購，不特擁擠狀態之下選擇困難。類皆毫無所獲，而曠時費力，莫此為甚。現行辦法原則上雖見改善，然公敎人員損失不貲，至十月份配售物資，一紙公告責成各機關於本月十五日以前，卽須前向貴局辦理配購手續。查各機關工作人員有內勤外勤之別，機關組織，每有上級下級之分，短短五日以內，各機關向職員辦理通知調查登記等種種手續，限期如此迫促，絕非各機關所能勉力邀辦。</p>
<p>調整配價何所根據</p>
<p>（二）配售價格概招公敎人員待遇隨時調整一節，未知根據何在，若謂配售物資價格必需調整，則物價變動何以可知恰與公敎人員之待遇相吻，若謂必須以其一部份薪水購買剩餘物資，則政府何不逕將公敎人員薪水扣除一部份，而以剩餘物資代償之，而况十月份以後售價調整，係「平均」照前增加一借半，則必有某種物品漲價在一倍半以上，有某種物品漲價在一倍半以下，又安得保證稍能切合公敎人員家庭實用之物品，漲價都不在一倍半以上，不切實用之物品都不在一倍半以下·而况公敎人員待遇之調整，僅見報載自十一月份起增加一倍半，迄尙未奉到明令，而貴局配售之物資，則已須於十月份起開始加價，關於此點，又不知貴局如何自圓其說。</p>
<p>賠償損害真意安在</p>
<p>（三）公吿辦法第九項有謂：「為售購雙方迅便起見，應請各自遵守秩序，並依照物品分配通告單依次購買，又為防止不肖奸究冒充公敎人負乘機搶購擾亂商店起見，併請在塲公敎人負共同協助員警糾正制止，如有發生擾亂事端，致各該部（商店）蒙受物資損害者，一次二次提高售價，以資賠償，經三次者卽停止此項優先配購辦法」一語，涵義晦澀，誠不揣眞意安在。若試照字面解釋，尤屬不成體統，旣係各機關照通知單依次購買，又何以能發生擾亂事端，且貴局物資一旦蒙受損害時，一次二次須提高售價以資賠償，三次卽停止此項優先配髒辦法，亦屬不知所云，蓋何人損害貴局之物資，貴局逕可繩之以法，或追究損害賠償之責任，焉能責令一般未來無辜受配人共同賠償。</p>

<h3>食米恐慌逐漸解除　白粳喊低至每石五百元</h3>
<p>食米市塲昨日正式恢復交易，到貨亦多，南北二市塲合計二、五七二石五斗。內北市塲一一三六石，南市塲一四三六石五斗。市况先高後渡，北市白粳初開五二〇元，收盤疲至五五〇元。南市白粳開盤五五〇元，收盤後塲外喊低至五〇〇元，尙無人問津。銀根奇緊，暗息仍高，外埠及洋米大量啟運來滬，故人心繼續看小·食米恐慌，下週間可能完全解除。</p>
<h3>鈔荒依然嚴重</h3>
<p>金圓劵監理會昨開會</p>
<p>本報訊〕金圓券發行限額在修正辦法正式抵滬前，仍維持廿億之原額，故市上之現鈔荒依然嚴重·昨日國家銀行及商行赴央行提款者甚多，發行局及業務局難於應付，發行局副局長陳延祚特赴俞鴻鈞寓邸，請示辦法。</p>
<p>有關係人士透露：金銀官價提高後，發行準額已有餘額，一俟正式公文抵滬後，發行限額勢必提高，屆時現鈔荒卽可解決·</p>
<p>又金圓券發行監理委員會，昨午亦召開會議，李銘等各委員均出席，按根據修正辦法，今後發行數字，除按月向政院報吿之外，未規定對外公佈。</p>
<p>國行要員奉召晉京</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕金圓券發行修正辦法公佈後，財長徐堪特電召央行負責人員晋京治商執行之技術問題，因央行正副總裁均在假期內，遂由李立俠·林崇墉·王紫霜·邵曾華·吳長賦等前往，預料各要員返滬後，金銀賣買及新辦法內各項規定，卽可決定實施。</p>
<p>銀根略鬆利率調整</p>
<p>市間銀根，昨日雖値週末，略見鬆弛。綠外埠匯款湧到，而金圓發行條例修正，人心稍見好轉，需單已無如過去之殷盛也·但市塲暗息，仍見堅坐高檔，約做日拆五十元至八十元，合月息一元半二元四角，現鈔籌碼，仍甚匱缺云。</p>
<p>上海銀錢業聯合準備會，曁上海銀行·錢莊·信託三業同業公會，鑒於運日市塲暗息急升，為適應起見，特再度調整各該會利率掛牌，茲特分誌於次：。</p>
<p>（一）存款日拆：每千元四元五角，合月息一角三分半，較原率增四分半。</p>
<p>（二）放款日拆：每千元十三元，合月息三角九分，較原率增一角二分。</p>
<p>（三）同業日拆：每千元十一元，合月息三角三分，較原率增一角〇五厘。</p>
<p>（四）公庫證日拆：每千元十一元，合月息三角三分，較原率增一角〇五厘。</p>
<p>新鑄硬幣即可發行</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自金圓券發行修正辦法公佈後，中央造幣廠正積極籌備鑄造硬幣，預計本月下旬內可正式發行·新辦法中，規定自一分至五角之輔幣，均以銅鎳分別鑄造，故五角之銀圓，雖已鑄成一部，事實上將不發行。惟迄今為止，尙未接獲財部正式指示。</p>
<h3>人民外匯存款仍應移存國行</h3>
<p>政府規定人民得持有金銀外幣之政策公佈後，對於過去政府規定之人民所有外匯申報移存辦法，是否繼續辦理一事，據有關方面表示：日昨公佈之新辦法中，對於金銀外幣之存款，規定由中央　行指定銀行辦理，故非指定銀行之不得收受是項存款，巳無疑問。其過去所有之外匯存歡，仍應移存，亦為必然之事云。</p>
<h3>進出口結匯　概按一比廿計算</h3>

<h3>淮南鐵路今昔</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　竇白萍</p>
<p>〔本報九龍崗八日訊〕淮南鐵路和淮南煤礦是現在淮南礦路股份有限公司管轄下的孿生兄弟，息息相關，相輔相成，沒有路，煤礦會窒息悶死，沒有礦，鐵路會蕭條沒落今天礦路兩局業務蒸蒸日上，就在於這兩位弟兄携手並肩，向固定的目標邁進。</p>
<p>一頁歷史現在，礦是每天每月日夜不斷在生產，路的全綫還未通一車，不單是礦的本身着急，整個安徽也為之呼喚不靈。這條路起自淮河北岸的田家菴到長江北岸的裕溪，全長二百十四公里，算來雖只有十多年的歷史，然而它是飽歷風霜，備嘗艱辛，正如一個窮人家的孩子，在母胎裘就沒有營養，先天不足，降世後又遭逢家變，後天失調。到今天，它沒有發育健壯，甚至肢體還有殘缺，雖然保母正在加意攝護，困難依然存在的。</p>
<p>當年計劃建築這條路時，原綫只由礦通到蚌埠，和津浦路接軌，運送煤片，但因須受津浦路限制，乃決定通到江邊，以求自由發展。最初由建設委員會撥付出售長興煤礦公司產權款項之一部五十萬元，作為築路基金，廿二年因為款不敷用，以建委會經營的戚　堰電廠首都電廠及淮南煤礦局的全部財產作抵，向上海銀行團貸款三百萬元，就中撥了一百二十八萬用以完成淮礦到合肥的工程，廿三年二次借得三百七十萬，路才成功，廿五年一月二十日全綫通車。這時煤的日產量是一千二百噸，運輸問題遂吿解決。</p>
<p>抗戰以來暴風雨來了，通車僅一年又半，抗戰軍興，廿六年十月奉令破壞，這條購佔地面二萬一千四百四十二市畝的鐵路，頓時成為無用土地，廿八年日本人恢復利用搶煤，後來把水家湖到裕溪一八八公里的軌道器村，折除移建為水家湖到蚌埠的支綫，由「華中鐵道管理委員會」直接管轄。日本投降後，水蚌支綫被匪破壞無遺，當局長吳競淸副局長胡衛中前來接收時，只有田家菴到水家湖二十七公里鐵路，三處殘破車站，一個未完成的機廠和三百輛破爛車輛，如此而已。修復淮南鐵路雖然喊得整天價響，錢呢？公司本身東拉西借，經過三年的時間，今年雙十節才由水家湖復軌通車到合肥七十公里的一段。在我們國家交通事業本來就不發達，淮南礦路公司由於客觀和主觀條件的限制，做起來尤其發生了意想不到的困難。</p>
<p>全綫問題整個國家在動盪，人民生活一直不安定，形成了交通工具的不够使用。江淮平原對外交通，寄望於淮南路全綫通車，已非一日，自水合段通車後，連同水田水蚱兩段，每日客運九千人，貨運更多，但合裕間不通，江淮平原依然感到窒悶。煤的運輸，現階段下委曲尤多。從外界·從自身·這條路必須迅速修復，而現在合肥至巢縣的復路器材，雖不成問題，且正進行舖軌，但巢縣至裕溪五十公里的器材尙無着落，這在國營大鐵路看來，或許微不足道，可是在淮南本身却不算簡單，尤其當經營失敗的今天。路總是要修的·　偵，時局如此，就怕借不到手，業務盈餘，畢竟有限，不關大用，公司方面在任何情形下也不忘記復路。據副局長胡衛中吿訴記者：如果錢不生問題，預定舊歷新年合巢段通車，明年喝雄黃酒時候，卽可通至江邊裕溪。記者在此祝福路局計劃如期吿成，江淮間對外交通不再窒息，煤也運到長江上下游，讓所有大小烟囱冒烟！</p>
<p>路局機廠加緊復路聲中，路局機廠的貢獻，不容漠視，承路局副局長寗樹藩機廠廠長柳新民兩先生領導記者參觀，計有機車。鍋爐·鑄工·鍜工·車輛·電工·機工·七塲。大小機械兩百多部，五再個孰練按工，分守着各種各樣的機械，埋頭修製工作，緊張，嚴肅，且有規律。除修製機車客貨車外，兼修輪船汽車，礦上機械也在這裏整修配件·組織上，現分為二部：第一機工廠，專司修製車輛配件，第二機工廠，專司修製機車配件，職員五十三人，管理支配五百個工人的工作·設備與原料限制了發展，輪軸輪箍不能自製，且須向國外購買，但今日風馳電掣在鐵路上漂亮的頭二等客車，就在這裏裝造的。</p>
<p>在烽火漫天淮上風雲日緊的今天，礦和路不免令人躭心，然而礦路當局並不考慮這些問題，他們和記者談話時表示：目前，做一點是一點，路總得求其全綫通車。他們建設的決心和勇氣，値得稱道贊揚。</p>

<h3>三蛇龍虎鳳</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>桂子飄香以後，菊有黃華的季節，在江南正是洋澄湖　上市，而在華南的穗港澳等地，却是三蛇龍虎會開始應客了。所謂三蛇者，是指金脚帶·飯匙頭·過樹龍三種毒蛇而說。據說金脚帶補脚部，飯匙頭補中部，過樹龍補頭部。蛇的毒，是從牙床分泌，捕蛇的先把蛇牙除去，蛇便無從放毒了。</p>
<p>烹蛇是先取膽剝皮，去骨拆絲，配着冬菰，石耳，冬筍，火腿，陳皮等切絲拌入淸燉。吃時加些鮮檸檬葉絲做香料，每人分小盌而吃，味極鮮美。請客的如果不事先說明，初吃的絕不知道是蛇羹，只贊味道鮮美而已。</p>
<p>蛇膽和酒飲，性甘凉，沒有苦味，功能祛風去濕。把它配製陳皮，胡椒，薑等或浸酒，功用相同。</p>
<p>烹蛇如用菓子貍（野貓）·黑肉鷄等同調製，叫做三蛇龍虎鳳大會；亦有單獨淸燉菓子貍出售，也屬冬令補品。</p>
<p>廣東因爲吃蛇的每年增加，省內的蛇產量减少，近來的蛇多從廣西捕販。有些狡獪的酒家，　用水蛇或蟾蜍肉來冒充，味道同樣淸美，功能却不同了。</p>
<p>有些賣蛇肉的，恐怕顧客說他冒充假貨，就從鉛綫籃裏提活蛇當面來宰，或是宰蛇後留着一些皮未脫盡，證明眞實。這是指實全副生三蛇的而說。</p>
<p>吃蛇以後兩三天，身上的皮膚毛管似有很薄的液體泌出，在換內衣或沐浴時便感覺到，這就是蛇的祛風去濕的功效。蛇肉飽含　質，人體虛弱的吃了很受補益。</p>
<p>除了三蛇之外，還有金錢豹大蛇，長有丈餘，身粗如人臂。宰蛇之前三四天，廣吿招買。因爲蛇重數十觔，非得多數顧客，不敢輕於宰售。它的烹製，與三蛇略同，惟價値較三蛇爲高，因非尋常可能捕到。</p>
<p>〔前幾天談吃狗肉，忘記寫述禁忌，卽是凡吃狗肉的，在十二小時以內，絕對的不能够吃菉豆湯（粥），否則狗肉在腸胃裏發脹，輕則劇痛，重則喪生，這是吃狗肉的應該牢記的禁忌。〕</p>
<h3>民意測騐</h3>
<p>— 仲堅</p>
<p>最近美國總統選舉，杜魯門出人意料的勝利，使許多政治觀察家和民意測騐機關爲之驚異失色。素負國際聲譽的蓋洛普民意測驗亦宣吿失靈，因此測騐專家蓋洛普氏不得不解嘲曰。「此種比數接近的選舉，每一世代僅有一次，往往使民意測騐家迷惑。」（本月三日合衆社紐約電）現在蓋洛普氏正在研究測騐失靈的原因，筆者特在此將美國的民意測騐機關作一簡略的介紹：</p>
<p>民意測騐本屬社會心理學上的一項應用技術，從少數受驗人中尋求出一個代表團體活動的综合的具體結論。它遝用有系統的方法，向被訪問者提出若千簡明扼要的問題，問題的形式包括問答法，是非法，和選擇法三種，交錯混合使用。測騐的凖確性，不在被訪問人數的多少，而在精選代表的人物，假如人選適當，有數百個選民，就可預測全國的選舉了。美國一般民意測騐機關測騐的對象通常用一千五百人到五千人。蓋洛普常用三千人，有時亦用六萬人。</p>
<p>美國的民意測驗機關，最有聲譽的當然首推蓋洛普（Gallup）在一九三五年創辦的「美國民意研究所」，此外幸福雜誌和普林士頓大學舉辦的民意測驗也很有名。美國多數民意測驗機關的經費是由報館供給，而由大學或半公共團體來主持。蓋洛普的經費得自全美一百多家報館，幸福雜誌的測騐經費是由該社供給，普林士頓大學民意研究處的經費係洛氏基金的贈款。</p>
<p>初期的民意測驗是用明信片郵寄，但能收回的不過四分之一，故近年多已改用訪問員，直接登門造訪，拒絕訪問的不到十分之一。蓋洛普外勤訪問員分佈在美國境內者一千二百人，在英國及加拿大各有二百人，在澳洲約有一百五十人。一次民意測驗的時間，全美國的需十天，英國面積小，四五天卽可完成。蓋洛普的訪問員都是大學畢業生，他們原各有正當的職業，民意測騐是兼差的工作。</p>
<p>訪問工作完畢之後，各區訪問員將答案寄回，經過一番彙集統計核對的程序，始由測驗機關正式公佈其結果·美國報紙對於民意測驗的報告，都當作新聞一樣地擇尤發表。如有人認爲測騐報吿不確實或有偏私，民意測臉機關歡迎覆核，以明眞相，並示公正無私的立塲。</p>
<h3>刑審鬥審戰審</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>哈蘭姆在其所著的「中古歐洲史的第一百二十九頁上，有關於野蠻的審理案件的介紹。</p>
<p>第一種是「刑審」：這不同於現在的「以刑逼供」，而是對巳判死刑的犯人，在執行前，被判死刑者可以請求「赴湯蹈火」，如果不受傷，則認爲有神佑，可以免死，祇須驅逐出境。</p>
<p>第二種是「鬥審」：審判官受理案件後，因沒有明顯證據，可資判決的，就由原吿和被吿用決鬥來決定·貴族與貴族間的訴訟，決鬥時都乘馬，執長矛，披甲胄，平民與平民間的訴訟，決鬥時徒步用棍棒相鬥；婦女或僧侶的訴訟，則各以代理人出塲，舉行決鬥。如果爭訟的案件是民事，那麼，鬥敗的一方就算敗訴，除放棄其所爭訟的目的物外，還須繳納罰金；如果以代理人（所代表的是婦女或僧侶）出塲參加決鬥的，那麼，鬥敗的代理人須砍去一手，以防此輩被僱用的決鬥人，受對方的賄賂。如果爭訟的案件是刑事，被吿鬥敗，就算敗訴，萬一被吿鬥勝了，則原吿須承受被吿敗訴時所應受的懲罰。</p>
<p>第三種是「戰審」：刑事案件的被吿，如果不服判決，可以向最高的藩主法庭去上訴；不過，這不服初判的被吿須冒「戰審」的危險。所謂「戰審」，就是這被吿須與下級法庭（初審判決處）的所有人員，一一戰鬥過去，倘能逐一獲勝，則該法庭的法官須處死刑，法庭也不准許再設立下去。如果那個不服初判而引起「戰審」的被吿在戰鬥中有一次失敗，則立刻被處死刑。</p>
<h3>青烏</h3>
<p>— 馬瘎湛翁</p>
<p>戲馬歌風未解圍，江淮萬井入煙霏，荒村虎飽疲氓盡，夜帳雷驩猛士歸，兩戒勢分天下半，四夷俗變百年非，白狐跳擲黃狐立，靑鳥西來恐倦飛。</p>
<h3>移山謠</h3>
<p>或傳贛有老民謂人曰：江西人不要廬山，最好將</p>
<p>此山移去。感而作此。</p>
<p>門前多事著名山，况有雲軿恣往還，野老謳歌聽不盡，世間五嶽要全删。</p>
<h3>戒煙禮讚</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>一兩個月以前，曾做過一篇「戒烟難」登在「自由談」，當時我因紙烟太貴，提倡抽水烟，頗有讀者對我表示同情。但我紙烟始終沒有戒掉。今日時異事異，紙烟身價日高一日，寒士收入日少一日，購買紙烟，竟要偷偷摸摸的去走黑市，更要賣交情，平生心高氣硬，不肯仰面求人，寗肯爲了抽烟，去仰人鼻息。而且我也不是道地的癮君子，旣然買烟很不容易，阮囊又復羞澀，爲了抽烟，受到太太多少次的嚕囌，衣服也不知燒穿多少次，今天抽完了最後一支烟的時候，又決心戒烟了·至於戒烟之後有妨文思，我也管不得了，「亂世文章不値錢」，酸溜溜的文章又何必去做？至於興緻吧，刺激品提出的興緻，也那得持久。</p>
<p>有人說：「飯後一支烟，賽過活神仙」。我終不信。嵇康豈不也說過，「神仙可以學得」·但他的結果呢？難道眞的是屍解嗎？我始終不信任什麽神仙的話。更有人說：「一支在手神思悠然」，所謂「無窮生滅看香烟」也。但我以爲不生不滅，閉門撤手，豈不更好。我決心要戒烟了，藉此可以顯見我的決心，我的能耐，我的毅力。皇天后土，輔我翼我。亞門！</p>
<h3>天作之合</h3>
<p>— 强</p>
<p>德境美國佔領軍司令官克萊將軍與他的妻子瑪喬麗。麥康結識的經過甚爲有趣，也算得上是一件當代名人的逸事。</p>
<p>當克萊還在西點軍校求學時，美麗的麥康小姐到軍校去看一位朋友。她乘公共汽車而來，車停時，克萊恰巧站在汽車附近，她走下汽車時，不愼失足翻落，又恰巧跌在克萊的雙臂中。他將她扶直，作了自我介紹，兩人一見鍾情，在克萊畢業那天便結婚了。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Around Xuzhou Enter Main Phase; Eastern Wing Continues to Annihilate Remnant Bandits; Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi Flies to Front Lines to Supervise the Battle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi flew to the eastern front lines of Xuzhou at 2:00 PM today to supervise the battle. National Army reinforcements are steadily arriving at the front lines. The large-scale annihilation battle in the Bayi Ji area continues fiercely. More than 15,000 bandits were annihilated in the Mukong area today, and the battle results are being expanded.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] Last night, the National Army on the eastern front surrounded four bandit columns of Chen's forces in Huashan Village, six *li* southeast of Bayi Ji. The joint land and air forces are intensifying their efforts to annihilate the bandits. The National Army can achieve a decisive victory within days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] On the western flank of Xuzhou, the National Army's Qiu Qingquan Corps annihilated more than 2,000 bandits from the 3rd Column of bandits in Huangshan, east of 　 County, on the morning of the 13th. The remnant bandits fled westward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] The Xuzhou campaign has now entered the main battle phase. The current decisive battlefield is Nianzhuang, more than 100 *li* east of Xuzhou. The area is named for the stone mills ("*nian*") produced there. It is located southwest of the intersection of the Bulao River and the Grand Canal, and the Longhai Railway runs through it, with a station located there. The National Army's Huang Corps chose this area as the decisive battlefield, which provides a superior strategic advantage, as it is backed by the Grand Canal, which can attract bandits crossing the Jialu River from the south, and annihilate them all on the west bank of the Grand Canal. The area is also about 100 *li* from Taierzhuang, where the National Army won a great victory during the War of Resistance. It is expected that news of a swift victory at Nianzhuang will be reported soon, reminding people that both of these villages will become great fortresses of victory in military history.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] The war around Xuzhou still focuses on the eastern wing today. The remaining bandits west of the Grand Canal and south of the Bulao River, except for a small number who are blocking reinforcements to the west, are mostly concentrated in Nianzhuang. In the Bayi Ji area, they are trying to make a last-ditch struggle. Our Huang Corps has high morale and is supported by the Air Force, making them more courageous as they fight. They are now repeatedly charging at the bandits. In retaliation for their continuous defeats, military sources claim that the bandits used poison gas bombs. Fortunately, the Huang Corps was prepared and did not suffer major damage. The 28th Division of the 10th Column of bandits, which was blocking reinforcements to the west, was once lured to Damiao, 30 *li* east of Xuzhou, last night, and after a fierce attack, two of its regiments were eliminated, and more than 300 prisoners were captured. The National Army then took advantage of the victory to point east, coordinating with the Huang Corps to attack the remnant bandits on both sides. In addition, there were contacts and artillery battles on the western wing and the northern and southern fronts after midnight this morning. The Liangguang Column of bandits on the western wing advanced towards Xinmin Village and Qibu, 40 *li* northwest of Xuzhou.

<h3>Grain Conference Concludes on the Same Day; President Chiang Gives Earnest Instructions Encouraging the Achievement of Quotas for Land Tax Collection and Borrowing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The National Grain Conference opened at 9:30 AM on the 13th in the auditorium of the Executive Yuan, presided over by Premier Weng Wenhao. President Chiang personally attended and delivered instructions. After the ceremony, the President delivered instructions, saying: "Grain is the foundation of the survival of the nation and the people, especially in wartime. This has been proven by historical facts both in China and abroad. Therefore, it is extremely important to have sufficient grain resources, seize opportunities, make overall planning, and allocate supplies. It is a crucial key to the success or failure of suppressing the rebellion. All provincial governments and public opinion organs should have a deep understanding of this. The quotas for land tax collection, borrowing, purchase, and procurement for this year must be achieved. Grain households across the country should be informed of the great righteousness and the advantages and disadvantages and must pay the required grain quotas on time. The central government has long stipulated clear regulations for the free flow of grain between provinces and counties, and for mutual aid to address surpluses and deficits. These regulations must be absolutely followed and earnestly implemented, and there must be no compliance in appearance but disobedience in reality, blocking and prohibiting transportation, which would create an artificial food shortage like today and affect the overall situation." The speech was earnest and lasted about forty minutes. Premier Weng then delivered a speech, giving many instructions on the importance of provinces fulfilling and delivering the agreed grain quotas on time and in full and on free circulation. Afterwards, the relevant ministers reported on the status of grain revenue and expenditure in great detail. Finally, proposals were discussed regarding increasing grain sources, allocating military grain on schedule and in full, and strictly prohibiting provinces and counties from banning the export of grain to ensure free circulation. The discussions were very detailed, and the principles were all approved as proposed. In the afternoon, ten groups discussed the proposals, convened by Vice President Zhang Jishen, Finance Minister Xu Kan, Comptroller-General Pang Songzhou, and Grain Minister Guan Jiyu. Guan's work report at the meeting detailed the situation of grain collection, borrowing, and shortages in various provinces, stating: "The quotas for collection and borrowing in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei provinces are about 6 million *shi* each, 4 million *shi* in Guangxi, and 3 million *shi* each in Yunnan and Guizhou, totaling more than 70 million *shi*. It is hoped that they can be raised quickly."

<h3>Burmese Side Invades by Building Roads; Commands Armed Police to Investigate Household Registration; Tempts People on Yunnan Border to Move Internal Boundary Markers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 13th] The northern and southern borders of Jian Gaoshan have not yet been demarcated. Taking advantage of this, the Burmese side has been invading and coveting the Yunnan border for more than a day. Recently, they sent Luba Bu to be responsible for supervising the construction of roads. One goes north along the Jiangxinpo, passing through the Daba Wuluo Three-way River to reach the southwest Yidi of Gongshan. The other goes south along Pianma, passing through Fugongpo, the Yunnan River to the Shui设治局. If the two roads are successfully built, the rich area of the Yunnan border area will be within the scope of the Burmese effort. The Burmese government is actively planning to start construction next spring, using light roads to enable the Yi people in the border area to trade directly with them, exchanging goods for raw materials. The survey of the mineral deposits in the Fugong mining area has been completed and is planned to be developed. Under the pretext of protecting road construction, they are commanding armed police to investigate household registrations in Luobian and other places, set up guards, and entice the residents on the banks of the Zhan Da River to move the boundary markers inward nearly a hundred *li* to the Kan army's vision.</p>

<h3>The Sentencing of Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>The sentencing procedure for Japanese Class A war criminals concluded on the 12th. According to the verdict read by the International Military Tribunal, the individual verdicts and sentences for Tojo Hideki and the other 24 were summarized in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Public opinion in our country has been closely following the sentencing of Tojo and other war criminals with intense interest. Those sentenced to death by hanging included Tojo Hideki, Doihara Kenji, Hirota Koki, Itagaki Seishiro, Kimura Heitaro, Matsui Iwane, and Muto Akira, a total of seven people. Those sentenced to life imprisonment included Araki Sadao, Hashimoto Kingoro, Hata Shunroku, Oshima Hiroshi, Shiratori Toshio, and Shimada Shigetaro, a total of sixteen people. Togo Shigenori was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment, and Shigemitsu Mamoru was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The individual verdicts rarely mentioned the responsibility of Emperor Hirohito. According to the tribunal president, Webb, Hirohito should be called the "culprit," but he had been granted immunity. This is a major historical event, and we cannot feel completely satisfied with the conclusion of this event. Furthermore, we are even more surprised and uneasy about Marshal MacArthur's willingness to accept requests to reduce the sentences of the defendants. Therefore, we cannot help but be skeptical of the fair and reasonable standards that the International Military Tribunal has strived to pursue.</p>
<p>The Far East International Military Tribunal officially began on April 29, 1946, and concluded with the verdict on November 12 of this year, totaling two years and seven months. If we consider the International Prosecution Section's commencement of the investigation of Japanese war criminals on November 6, 1945, it has been exactly three years. Three years ago, the sacred spirit of the Potsdam Declaration was revered by peace-loving people all over the world. In the three years since, the justice of the Potsdam Declaration has gradually faded, gradually deteriorated, and even the punishment of Japanese Class A war criminals has been gradually diminished in its political and legal significance. The only consolation is that the verdict read this time is 2,500 pages long, with rich materials and complete descriptions, serving not only as a history of Pacific international relations over the past two decades, but also as a history of Japan's aggression wars abroad over the past two decades, possessing infinite historical significance, but not entirely a complete history. Although we have not yet read the full text of the verdict, we have developed a sense of suspicion from the sporadic reports, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>First, regarding the individual punishments: According to Article 10 of the Potsdam Declaration: "Stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners." The Allied Headquarters in Japan promulgated the Trial Ordinance on January 25, 1946, stipulating that the crimes to be tried by the court were of three types: (1) Crimes against peace, i.e., crimes of planning, preparing, initiating, and implementing aggressive war; (2) Crimes in violation of the laws and customs of war; (3) Crimes against humanity. As for the distinction between the severity of the three crimes, the direct perpetrators of the second and third types of crimes were Class C war criminals, their direct supervisors were Class B war criminals, and those responsible for the first type of crime were Class A war criminals. The 28 people (now only 25) tried by the International Military Tribunal, all belong to Class A war criminals, that is, all are direct perpetrators of crimes against peace. According to the precedent of the Nuremberg judgment and the standards of international criminal law, Japanese Class A war criminals should generally be sentenced to death by hanging and life imprisonment. As a result, only Tojo, Doihara and other seven were sentenced to death by hanging, and Shigemitsu and Togo were sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term. This is a kind of "leniency" that exceeds the standard of fairness. Although this iron judgment has reached a point of no return, peace-loving people all over the world find it difficult to accept the fact that sixteen Class A war criminals such as Araki are not dead.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the issue of Hirohito's lack of responsibility for the war: The leaders of Japan's war efforts over the past two decades were Hirohito and his inner circle of senior officials. In theory and in fact, Hirohito and his inner circle of senior officials cannot shirk their responsibility for disrupting the peace and war. Hirohito is not only an idol of the Japanese people, but also an authority in Japanese politics. The fact that Hirohito announced the surrender is proof of his authoritative political status. The Allied Headquarters granted Hirohito immunity, and the International Military Tribunal did not pursue the matter, indicating that the court's trial was more or less influenced by the Allied Headquarters. This is a regrettable event in the two years of hard work of the International Military Tribunal. Kido Koichi, a senior official in the inner circle and a supporter of the Tojo Cabinet, presided over the planning of the Pacific War and committed heinous crimes, but was sentenced to life imprisonment, reducing Kido's responsibility for disrupting the peace, which is tantamount to showing goodwill to Hirohito, and this is also something that people are not satisfied with.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the issue of sentence reduction: The lovable aspect of the Nuremberg trials was that the sentence was executed immediately after the pronouncement, and no sentence reduction was granted. The Allied Headquarters controlled the Tokyo trials, and it had the right to reduce the sentences of the defendants or order a delay in execution. The disadvantages of sentence reduction were discussed in this newspaper's editorial on the 4th of this month; we oppose the adoption of a military dictatorship's ruling system, changing the law with consciousness, changing the law with emotions, and changing the law with orders. Unexpectedly, at the end of the sentencing on the 12th, the Allied Headquarters announced that it was prepared to accept requests to reduce the sentences of the defendants and would invite representatives of the Control Committee to discuss the issue of sentence reduction, indicating that the Allied Headquarters had a plan in mind for reducing the sentences of Class A war criminals. As far as we know, Shigemitsu and Togo will be pardoned and acquitted, and half of the sixteen war criminals sentenced to life imprisonment will be converted to fixed-term imprisonment; as for whether the seven sentenced to death by hanging will receive preferential treatment for sentence reduction, it seems to be still undecided. This method of sentence reduction is a bad example that violates legal justice. If it is misused, it will inevitably lead to dissatisfaction among peace-loving people; this is tantamount to accommodating and even encouraging aggression. We hope that the representatives of the Control Committee and the responsible officials of the Allied Headquarters will handle it with a rigorous attitude. Those who play with fire will be burned by it. Isn't the painful lesson of history enough to be a warning?</p>
<p>The above three points are our feelings about the conclusion of the Tokyo trial sentencing, and also the attitude of doubt held by peace-loving people all over the world today towards the dignity of the law. We hope that the responsible officials of the Allied Headquarters and the representatives of the Control Committee will face up to the huge reaction of human peace and justice!</p>
<h3>Floating Capital Decided to be Effectively Diverted; Northeast Circulation Notes Completed Redemption on the 7th of This Month; Interest Rates on Deposits and Loans of Banks and Firms to be Publicly Posted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Ministry of Finance News: The redemption of Northeast Circulation Notes will be completed on the 20th of this month. The total amount of redemption has not yet been reported by the Central Bank. As for the amount of Gold Yuan issued at the end of October, the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee has announced it. The total amount circulating in the Northeast is currently impossible to estimate. After the changes in the Northeast political situation, the inflow of floating capital is an inevitable fact. In addition to using the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, enemy and puppet industries, and Gold Yuan treasury bills, and encouraging investment in production, the government is now trying to make effective diversions to avoid affecting price fluctuations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Ministry of Finance News: Since the promulgation of the supplementary measures for improving economic controls, the management of banks and money firms is being actively supervised, and banks and firms are instructed to use their funds to assist important production, transportation, sales, and public transportation export businesses, in order to promote production and stabilize prices. On the negative side, strict inspections are still being carried out to crack down on illegal operations of banks and firms, in order to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding. As for the deadline for increasing capital of banks and firms, the original two-month limit will still apply, but the implementation date in various places may be handled in accordance with the regulations on the date of legal implementation. Regarding the interest rates on deposits and loans of banks and firms, in order to cooperate with the implementation of supplementary economic control measures, the interest rate management regulations will still be followed, allowing the local banking and money industry associations to formulate interbank daily borrowing and lending rates and lending daily borrowing rates, report them to the local central bank for approval, and post them for implementation. This opinion has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and it can be implemented once approved.</p>

<h3>Many Judges of the International Military Tribunal Express Regret for Not Trying the Japanese Emperor; Execution Date for Tojo and Others Possibly on December 8th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] At least two judges on the International Military Tribunal have strongly advocated trying Emperor Hirohito of Japan as a war criminal. One is the president of the court, Sir William Webb, and the other is French Judge Bernard. Although it is not yet known how many judges on the court share the same opinion as these two, at least two other judges have privately expressed their strong desire to see Hirohito stand trial as a criminal. Many judges of the court believe that even requesting Hirohito to testify is impossible, which is a loss for future historical records. When expressing his dissent, Judge Bernard of France insisted that Hirohito should be tried for war crimes, and the 25 convicted war criminals are merely accomplices of Hirohito.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] The execution of Tojo and six other war criminals sentenced to death by hanging by the Far East International Military Tribunal may take place on December 8th, the eighth anniversary of the Pacific War. It is widely rumored among Japanese and Allied residents that they will be executed on the morning of December 8th, possibly at the same time they launched the attack on Pearl Harbor eight years ago, igniting the Pacific War. This news seems credible because MacArthur has only allowed the defendants one week to submit appeals. Allied officials have declined to comment. Tojo has announced through his lawyer that he does not intend to appeal to MacArthur, but at least three of the twenty-five have requested clemency from MacArthur.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th, Associated Press] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other war criminals, who have been sentenced to death by hanging, are expected to be executed by Eighth Army officers at Sugamo Prison here.</p>

<h3>Announcement to Telegraph and Telephone Users</h3>
<p>— Ma Mu</p>
<p>With military tensions on the front lines and the abandonment of price controls, the market has been fluctuating drastically, and prices are soaring. In this situation, the number of telegrams and telephone calls at the telecommunications bureau has increased several times like a tidal surge. The workload has already reached an extreme. Although the staff of the telecommunications bureau are working without a moment's rest, they still cannot clear the large backlog of telegrams and telephone calls. We naturally feel that we have not developed the manpower and equipment to a sufficient level in peacetime, but we are confident that we can endure hardship and work hard to the best of our ability when business is particularly busy. With the country facing difficulties and the overall situation turbulent, telecommunications transmission is particularly important in this era, and telecommunications employees cannot slack off in the slightest. We are working diligently at our posts, day and night, but we also hope that users understand the current difficulties in our work and give us more cooperation.</p>
<p>First, incoming and outgoing telegrams between Shanghai and Xuzhou-Bengbu have recently become more frequent due to increased military telegrams, and may not arrive within the specified time limit. The reason is that telegrams between Shanghai and these two locations must pass through the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau for transfer. Unfortunately, a major fire broke out at the Nanjing Bureau on the 8th, and work was suspended for a time. It is currently being rapidly cleared, and delays in transmission time are inevitable.</p>
<p>Second, in the past, the telecommunications bureau translated incoming and outgoing telegrams on behalf of users. However, with the increase in telegram traffic, manpower is still limited, and it is difficult to cope. We hope that telegram users can translate telegrams themselves as much as possible. This may add a step for users, but it greatly facilitates the transmission speed of the entire telegram.</p>
<p>Finally, long-distance telephone registration is also similarly congested. With limited lines, connections are made in order, and exceeding the time limit is occasionally unavoidable. In short, if users can understand these difficulties, we will continue to work hard to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Cable Circuits</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>The equipment that the telecommunications bureau provides to users for installing telephones includes an automatic or manual switchboard in the bureau and a telephone or small exchange in the user's home. Between these two, there are cable circuits, which serve as telephone pairs for communication. When each user wants to have a private conversation on the telephone with another user, they certainly do not want others to interfere or hear their words. Therefore, each user must have a pair of lines for their exclusive use. This is different from other public utilities such as water, electricity, and gas, where a main pipe can be laid on a prosperous street to provide common use for users on both sides. However, telephone circuits must gather a large number of user pairs into a main cable and distribute them in a fan shape from the telephone exchange. Therefore, each exchange must have a cable circuit network, which must be perfectly planned before establishment. This is the main topic of telephone technology and the fundamental basis for installing telephones.</p>
<p>When a telephone exchange is first established, it must first define the business area. The size of this business area should be determined based on the simplicity or complexity of local commerce and the density or sparseness of residences. The location of the exchange should be in the center of the business area, so that the cable circuits are distributed in all directions, each with an average distance. After the location of the exchange is determined, the cable circuit network must be planned. This circuit network must be designed meticulously. More core cables should be laid on prosperous streets, while thinner cables can be laid in secluded alleys, or even overhead lines can be used. In recent years, the switchboard capacity of telephone exchanges in major cities around the world has been very large, and the thick cables used have as many as 3,600 cores, meaning that each cable can accommodate 1,800 pairs of user lines. Common sizes are 1,200 pairs, 600 pairs, 300 pairs, and 200 pairs. Thin types have 100 pairs, 50 pairs, and 25 pairs. Those installed on the walls of alleys are as thin as 15 pairs, 10 pairs, and 5 pairs. These cable cores are made of No. 21 hard copper wire, wrapped with red and white dry paper. Each red and white wire pair is twisted together to ensure complete insulation between them. The outermost layer is wrapped in lead skin. During manufacturing, internal moisture is removed to prevent leakage. Cables with more than 200 pairs are installed underground, using multi-hole clay pipes, nine or twelve holes, arranged in pipelines and buried in the road. At regular intervals, a manhole is opened, which is the round iron-covered hole commonly seen on the road. This manhole is the junction of the cables, quite deep and wide. During repairs, workers can stand inside to test and repair the circuits. Thin cables with less than 100 pairs are installed on telephone poles, suspended by hanging cable steel ropes and iron hooks. The end point of the cable is the distribution box. Distribution boxes have capacities of 100 pairs, 50 pairs, and 25 pairs. From the distribution box, either overhead copper wire or skin wire is used to connect the user line to each user's telephone. Therefore, when a user applies for installation, the circuit must be investigated first. This is to investigate whether there are empty lines in the cable box nearest to the application location. Assuming that the capacity of this distribution box is 100 pairs and 100 users have already been installed, later applications cannot be installed. If it is necessary to use the empty lines of a farther distribution box, the required materials will be greater, and more obstacles will arise, making maintenance difficult and inappropriate. The cable networks of Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's automatic telephone exchanges mostly use 600-pair and 300-pair underground cables, while manual exchange cables mostly use 100-pair overhead cables. As for longer distances and long-distance trunk cable circuits, No. 19 hard copper core wire is used, with the addition of loading coils, which can reduce the transmission loss of calls. This is another technical mystery, which will be elaborated in another article.</p>
<p>The design of a cable circuit network is a difficult task in engineering. Before designing, it is necessary to investigate the number of users in each type of building on each street in the business area who may apply for telephone installation, and to predict the degree of development in the coming years. Furthermore, it is necessary to estimate the number of telephone calls that users are likely to make each day after installing a telephone, so that the external cable circuit network and the number of switchboards in the bureau are mutually coordinated. Only with such a design can it be called a success. However, precise plans are often broken by the evolution of the situation. Taking the Hongkou Telephone Exchange under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau as an example, its cable network was originally designed by the Japanese enemy's Central China Company. At that time, the distribution of cables in the area east of Saisan Road was emphasized, and all were focused on this area. However, in the past three years, stores and residences in the western and northern Zhongshan Road areas of the Zhabei district of Hongkou have become increasingly prosperous, and there is often a lack of empty cable lines. Expansion and development are in the plan, but wire material projects require huge sums of money, and it will take time to realize them.</p>

<h3>Long-Distance Telephone, the Sound of a Thousand Miles</h3>
<p>— Si Sheng</p>
<p>(1) The Most Convenient Communication Tool</p>
<p>Long-distance telephone is really one of the most convenient and efficient communication tools. No matter how far apart the two parties are, as long as the telecommunications bureau's lines extend to and open long-distance telephone service, they can freely talk, quickly achieve the purpose of the call, reduce the waste of time, and the method of use is simple, and people of all levels can enjoy it universally. Long-distance telephone has one more advantage: unlike other communication tools, such as letters, telegrams, etc., which can only be one-way communication, it can enable the two parties to meet and talk in a short period of time and make decisive decisions on important matters. Therefore, in today's increasingly complex social affairs, long-distance telephone has made a brilliant contribution, not only making everyone happy to use it, but also becoming an indispensable tool in human daily life.</p>
<p>(2) Long-Distance Telephone Registration Procedures</p>
<p>If you are often using long-distance telephones and already have a local telephone installed, it is best to go to the telecommunications bureau to pre-pay long-distance call fees. The amount of pre-payment is determined according to the number of long-distance calls made in a month. After completing this procedure, users do not need to go to the business office to register when making a call, just dial a telephone number. Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau users, please dial 13, Shanghai Telephone Company users, please dial 03 to register, and tell the recording station your telephone number, the name and address of the called party, and the type of call. After the long-distance operator has finished recording and checked that there are no errors, the operator will tell you the approximate connection time, and then wait quietly for the call. After the call, you do not need to pay the call fee immediately. At the end of the month, the telecommunications bureau will send you a detailed list of the long-distance calls you made in that month. According to the settlement of this list, go to the telecommunications bureau to settle the account once. If you do not have a local telephone installed at home, then you can only go to the telecommunications bureau business office to register, first get a long-distance telephone registration form, pay the call fee, and wait in order for the call, the procedure is also the same convenient.</p>
<p>(3) Types of Calls</p>
<p>Long-distance telephone calls are divided into "Ordinary," "Expedited," and "Express" according to speed. According to the nature, there are "Call Number," "Call Person," and "Call Out" types. A "Call Number" call is a call that only calls the telephone number, for example, Shanghai 71634 calls Nanjing 22001 without specifying someone to answer the call. As long as the two telephone lines are connected, the call is considered completed. This type of telephone is often used by large stores or important institutions. A "Call Person" call is when the calling party wants a specific person at a specific telephone number in a certain place to answer the call. However, if the calling party is afraid that the called person is not there, the calling party can declare in advance that if the called person is not there, another person can be designated to answer the call on their behalf. A "Call Out" call is used for called parties who do not have their own telephone. If you want to make a telephone call to a friend in another city, but the friend does not have a telephone at home, you need to ask the local telecommunications bureau to send someone to the friend's home to notify them, you need to use this type of "Call Out" telephone. This type of telephone is more troublesome in procedure and wastes more time, so the price is relatively high. There is also a cheap night call. If the telephone you are making is not time-sensitive and can be made between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am the next morning, you may wish to make a night call, and the call fee is calculated at 70% of the original call type.</p>
<p>(4) How to Calculate the Number of Calls</p>
<p>The number of long-distance telephone calls is calculated from the start of the call, every three minutes is considered one call, even if it is less than three minutes, it must be counted as three minutes. If it exceeds three minutes, it is counted as two calls, and the maximum is three calls. In other words, each call can last up to nine minutes. Time is very precious, so there is no need to say much about greetings, and if you want to say it, say it after the important things have been discussed.</p>
<p>(5) Payment and Cancellation of Registration and Free Cancellation of Registration</p>
<p>After applying to make a long-distance telephone call, if the call is not made for some reason and the registration is cancelled, if the responsibility lies with the user, such as the called party is not there, the called party's address is incorrect or exceeds the transmission range, resulting in failure to notify, or is unwilling to make the call within the specified time limit after registration, a cancellation fee should be paid. If the responsibility lies with the telecommunications bureau, such as temporary line failure preventing connection to the called party, or the called party has been called but the calling party cannot be called, or the long-distance line is congested and cannot be cleared in time, resulting in the call not being connected after the specified time limit after registration and unwillingness to wait, the cancellation will be processed free of charge.</p>

<h3>Telecommunications Knowledge Talk (14)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 6 How to Calculate the Number of Words (Continued)</p>
<p>Foreign Language Telegrams Just as we usually call all non-Chinese people "foreigners," we collectively call all characters not used by the various ethnic groups in China "foreign languages." There are a total of fifty-six languages in the world that are allowed to be used to write clear language telegrams. Each country, in addition to its own national language, adopts all or selects certain languages from these fifty-six languages as the languages approved for use in clear language telegrams.</p>
<p>The method of calculating the number of words in various foreign language telegrams is as follows: assuming that the sender writes according to the regulations and does not connect several words with relatively short spellings into one word in an attempt to skillfully save money, the usual practice is to count every fifteen letters as one word, that is to say, every word whose spelling length is within fifteen letters is counted as one word for billing purposes, and every word exceeding fifteen letters but within thirty letters must be counted as two words for billing purposes. If there are business logos or various abbreviations commonly used in the telegram, they are all counted as one word for every five letters. This is the basic principle for calculating telegram fees for foreign language telegrams.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we can see two kinds of word counts listed in the word count column of the incoming telegram header, for example, 18/15. This means that although only fifteen words are written in this telegram, because there are three words that should each be counted as two words, or there is one word that should be counted as three words and another that should be counted as two words, or there is one word that should be counted as four words, therefore, the entire telegram needs to be charged according to eighteen words. Therefore, we usually call the word count written before the forward slash (/) the "chargeable word count," and the word count written after the forward slash the "actual word count." In this section, we are preparing to talk about various methods of calculating the "chargeable word count." As for the actual word count, it only needs to be calculated according to the actual word count, which is very simple and does not need to be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>Among the various languages in the world, English is still the most widely used language to date. This is an undeniable fact. Taking China as an example, English is used in the absolute majority of foreign language telegrams between various parts of China or between China and foreign countries. Here, let me give a general introduction to the method of calculating the chargeable word count in English clear language telegrams:</p>
<p>(Note): The "single word" mentioned in each subsection below refers to counting every fifteen letters as one word. If it is exceeded, a telegram fee is added for every one to fifteen letters added. "Individual calculation" refers to individually calculating according to the original number of words contained in the word.</p>
<p>(1) Webster's Dictionary Method for Calculating Compound Words and Altered Words</p>
<p>1. Compound words defined in the dictionary (that is, words in Webster's Dictionary that connect two single words with a hyphen, such as connecting "to" and "day" into "to-day." For this type of compound word, just remove the hyphen and connect them into one word such as "today," then it can be calculated as a single word.</p>
<p>2. Altered words defined in the dictionary can be calculated as single words simply by removing the apostrophe, for example, writing DON'T (=do not) as DONT, writing MUSTN'T (=must not) as MUSTNT, and both are counted as one word. Also, for words indicating possession, if the possessive marker is omitted, for example, writing CHANG'S as CHANGS, it can also be counted as one word. However, if the sender insists on sending the hyphens, apostrophes, or possessive markers of the above omitted words, then the telegraph office will count the words before and after the hyphens, apostrophes, or possessive markers as one word each, and the hyphen, apostrophe, or possessive marker itself will also be counted as one word. According to this method, TO-DAY, DON'T, MUSTN'T, CHANG'S, etc., must each be charged as three words, which is of course very uneconomical.</p>

<h3>Ivat and Lie Call on the Leaders of the Four Powers to Resolve the Berlin Dispute; Secretary Marshall Issues a Statement Reaffirming the U.S. Position</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 13th] United Nations General Assembly President Ivat and UN Secretary-General Lie today jointly appealed to the heads of state of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 13th] The President of the Security Council, also the Argentine Foreign Minister, Bramuglia, met with Soviet Representative Vyshinsky last night. According to sources close to Bramuglia, the two discussed the Berlin issue. It is believed that Bramuglia is drafting a new plan to resolve the Berlin dispute, but the attitude of the Soviet Union is unknown.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Paris, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference that the United States still hopes that the Security Council can put forward a proposal to resolve the Berlin deadlock. He continued, "The position expressed by the Western countries on October 27 remains valid." This statement reiterates the willingness of the Western countries to implement suggestions for resolving the Berlin deadlock, similar to those previously proposed by neutral countries but rejected by the Soviet Union. Secretary Marshall stated that the United States will continue to maintain the Berlin airlift and is confident that it will succeed. Marshall did not believe the news from Moscow suggesting that President Truman might meet with Stalin, considering it indicative of the Soviet leaders' frustration at not being able to garner support for their policies in the United Nations and elsewhere. Marshall also stated that the people of the world should be wary of Soviet propaganda, saying that everyone desires peace and not propaganda for peace. Regarding the proposed North Atlantic Security Treaty, Marshall pointed out that the discussions between the United States and Western European countries were initially exploratory in nature but have now entered a more concrete stage. Discussing the European Recovery Program, Marshall said that there has been significant progress. Regarding the situation in Greece, Marshall said that the Greek problem is part of a larger problem, which can be seen in the Soviet blockade of Berlin and the rise of the Communist Party in China. Regarding his own tenure issue, Marshall stated that he has never indicated when his term as Secretary of State will end and will not make such a statement until he consults with President Truman.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 13th] Marshall recently issued a brief statement denying that he had decided to resign on January 20. The full text of the statement is as follows: "I read in the newspaper this morning that I 'insist on my original decision to resign from the cabinet on January 20.' I regret that my remarks at yesterday's press conference have caused a misinterpretation. I thought I had clearly stated that I would not make a decision until I discussed it with the President, and the President and I have not yet discussed this matter."</p>
<h3>Vyshinsky Defends Himself Vigorously; Claims Soviet Policy Aims at Peace; Says Plan for World Revolution is Also Untrue</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 13th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to debate the issue of disarmament today. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke, accusing the United States of preparing another "Pearl Harbor" for the Soviet Union. He said that Americans like Air Force Lieutenant General Kenney have announced their plans to take off from British bases with American long-range bombers, carrying atomic bombs directly over the Soviet Union. "You are using trickery and intolerance to try to start a war, but today you are trying to shift the blame to us, who have never dreamed of doing so."</p>
<p>He exclaimed, "You create this atmosphere of suspicion and fear day and night. You hide behind France, preparing to return the Ruhr area to Hitler's subjects, and have already torn up international agreements with one hand." British and American representatives condemned the Soviet Union on the 12th for obstructing the peace treaties with Germany and Japan. Vyshinsky replied, "Peace treaties with Germany and Japan can be concluded, but they should not be limited to one area. The Potsdam Agreement has established a foundation, but instead of following it, you have chosen to establish West Germany to rival the Soviet Union, rather than seeking a comprehensive solution." Regarding Japan, he said that the original agreement was to entrust the power of resolution to the Council of Foreign Ministers, but the Western countries demanded to convene a peace conference of all countries that fought against Japan. "Because you obstructed one of them, the peace treaty could not be concluded." Vyshinsky denied that the Soviet Union's goal was world revolution and cited the record of Stalin's meeting with American journalist Howard in Moscow in 1936 as proof. Stalin told Howard at the time, "It is foolish to believe that the Soviet Union is planning a world revolution. Any country can have a revolution if it wishes, and it can do without it if it does not. But to say that we intend to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and instigate revolutions is completely unfounded." He also said, "If you try to cover up the aggressive intentions of your policies by shouting that the Soviet Union has ambitions, this is nothing more than a fairy tale for children. All we are doing is for the sake of peace."</p>

He also said: "Soviet protests have been ignored, causing numerous obstacles to the activities of Japanese democratic groups, and more than a dozen examples of the suffocation of Japanese democratization have occurred." He said: Japanese democrats are being suppressed. Extreme fascist national forces are rising, and actively unfolding. They are sometimes openly advocating the repeat fascistic behavior in Japan. Derevyanko asked the party to stand to attention and immediately oppose Japanese democratic groups due to "suppression" in fascist activities.</p>

<h3>Standard Salary for Employees to Be Determined Based on Rising Living Costs; Authorities to Announce Decision Tomorrow Following Request from the General Labor Union, Employees Will Not Be Differentiated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] All sectors have recently shown the greatest concern for the city's cost of living index. The Municipal Government, recognizing this as a practical and technical issue, has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly manage it with the Statistics Office. Yesterday afternoon, the General Labor Union representatives Shui Xiangyun, Liang Yongzhang, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Fang Rusheng, and others visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau again. They stated that the union had repeatedly received requests from trade unions of department stores, clothing stores, sauce manufacturers, and canned food factories, indicating that the cost of living index compilation included fifty-four items for workers and ninety-three items for staff. The staff index was lower than the worker index, and those whose salaries were calculated based on the staff index were experiencing severe difficulties in this period of drastic price fluctuations, requesting that salaries be calculated based on the worker index. The General Labor Union therefore requested a uniform compilation of the cost of living index, generally referred to as the employee cost of living index, without distinguishing between workers and staff. Director Wu accepted this request. As for the allocation of rice, sugar, oil, cloth, and fuel to industrial workers starting from November, the allocation certificates have been printed, and distribution can begin after the 15th. Soap and cigarettes may also be added to the allocation. After meeting with the representatives of the General Labor Union, Director Wu immediately went to see Mayor Wu to seek instructions regarding the cost of living index issue. The mayor agreed to the General Labor Union's proposed approach. According to Director Wu, after meeting with the mayor, he told reporters that a figure would be announced by the Municipal Government or the Social Affairs Bureau on the 15th to serve as a standard for salary payments in various industries.</p>

<h3>Yu Shengxiao Murder Case: Que Li Still Sentenced to Lengthy Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Englishman Que Li A Que, in collusion with the American officer Ma Lai, plotted to shoot and kill the gold bar broker Yu Shengxiao and rob gold bars. The District Court previously sentenced Que Li to life imprisonment. Subsequently, the case was sent to the Supreme Court for review, which determined that the case involved robbery and murder and transferred it to the Special Criminal Tribunal for trial. The Special Criminal Tribunal gave judgment on the case and pronounced the sentence yesterday morning. Que Li was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to murder and robbery of property.

<h3>Cooperative Loans Used for Personal Gain: Xie Shimin and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Xie Youmin, chairman of the Zihang Township Cooperative in Shanghai County, and Xie Yaoquan, the manager, applied to the Shanghai County branch of the China Farmers' Bank for a loan of 627.52 million legal tender in June of this year to purchase 424 pieces of soybean cake at a price of 1.48 million legal tender per piece. The Agricultural Bank stipulated that the soybean cake should be loaned to farmers, with interest at 7.5% to be collected by the end of November. Xie and others violated the regulations and issued the soybean cake on July 3rd, charging 2.5 million legal tender per piece without authorization, and collecting fees at that time. The Agricultural Bank detected the matter and notified the Shanghai County Government to detain and interrogate them, and then transferred them to the Shanghai District Procuratorate for investigation. The case has been concluded by the District Procuratorate, and yesterday, they were publicly prosecuted for corruption.</p>

<h3>General Labor Federation Inaugural Meeting Decided to Move to Shanghai; Li Zhuchen and One Other Person Re-Elected to Go to Beijing Yesterday; Representatives in Beijing Invited to Attend in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The inaugural meeting of the National General Federation of Industry, originally scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 11th of this month, was moved because more than a hundred representatives from Shanghai and other places in Shanghai were unable to go to Beijing due to transportation difficulties. Yin Zhizhong, Guo Yongxi, and Xi Zhengxi were specially elected to go to Beijing to request that the meeting be moved to Shanghai and to invite representatives in Beijing to come to Shanghai. After Yin Zhizhong and the other two arrived in Beijing, they immediately stated the opinions of the representatives remaining in Shanghai to the General Assembly and visited Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Minister Gu said that the government had no preconceived notions about whether the General Assembly was held in Beijing or Shanghai, but hoped that all representatives would work together to ensure the smooth progress of the meeting. The Nanjing side had held the meeting as scheduled and also sent representatives to Shanghai to invite the representatives remaining in Shanghai to attend the General Assembly in Beijing. Yesterday, the representatives remaining in Shanghai held meetings all day long and reached an agreement with the Nanjing side to postpone the meeting. After much negotiation, they invited some representatives in Beijing to agree to move the meeting to Shanghai. The representatives in Beijing were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:25 last night. Shanghai industry leaders Du Yuesheng and Liu Hongsheng also planned to hold a banquet on the 6th floor of the China Merchants Bureau to welcome them, but they were unable to make it due to the train delay. Last night, Shanghai re-elected Li Zhuchen, Pan Yangshan, Chen Yunzhang, Yan Yaoqiu, Zhi Bingyuan and other five people to take the night train to Beijing to once again invite the representatives in Beijing to continue to participate in the General Assembly in Shanghai. If there are no other changes, the inaugural meeting of the General Federation of Industry will continue to be held in Shanghai on the 15th and 16th of this month, and the venue has been selected at No. 27 Dihua North Road. The Municipal Industrial and Economic Association has set up a reception group to solve the food, accommodation, and return transportation problems for the representatives from all over the country who come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Private Schools Decide to Continue Collecting Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees to Subsidize the Livelihoods of Teachers and Staff, Charging Two to Four Times the Original Fee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Private primary and secondary school teachers in this city are facing serious threats to their livelihoods due to soaring prices. A few days ago, they sent representatives to visit Mayor Wu, requesting that the November rice allocation be issued immediately, and that teachers be given a subsidy of 500 yuan per person. In addition to the special rice allocation, the mayor agreed to notify the Civil Affairs Committee to issue it as soon as possible. However, the subsidy could not be allocated due to the city's treasury deficit. After discussion, the mayor agreed in principle to collect additional fees from students' parents to alleviate the emergency. The Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools convened an enlarged meeting of directors and supervisors at No. 553 Zhongzheng Middle Road at 3 p.m. yesterday, with representatives from the teaching staff also attending to discuss the matter. It was decided to continue to collect tuition and miscellaneous fees from students' parents, with the standard being two to four times the fees charged by each school at the beginning of the semester. The collection will begin after the 18th of this month, with the principle being to collect the fees in one lump sum, and to expand the number of free places as much as possible so that poor students will not be unable to attend school. In addition to free places, individual applications for payment in installments may also be made. The proceeds from this additional collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees will be used primarily to subsidize the livelihoods of teachers and staff, as well as to subsidize school workers and to cover the increased costs of water and electricity for the school. After the meeting, Jiang Jizhou, chairman of the Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools, visited Li Ximou, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, to report on the results of the meeting. Director Li said that this matter must take into account the burden on parents and that technical issues must be discussed in detail, and a final decision will be made after requesting instructions from the mayor.</p>
<p>According to the fee standards for private schools in this city this semester, senior high school is 45 to 60 yuan, junior high school is 25 to 50 yuan, and elementary school is 15 to 30 yuan.</p>

<h3>Military Dropped a Bomb, Fortunately It Did Not Explode and Injure Anyone</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Han Changfu, a worker at the Tongshang Transportation Company on Huqiu Road, was driving a transportation truck with license plate number 03-3197 to the Maigen Road Station at about 8:10 yesterday morning to load goods. When passing Jinlin Road in Zhabei, a military truck came head-on. Because the truck was traveling very fast and the road was rugged, an object on the military truck was shaken off and fell to the ground. Han saw it and jumped down to pick it up. He saw that it was wrapped in newspapers and was quite heavy. After taking it back to the transportation company, he unwrapped the package and was shocked to find that it was a small bomb, about eight inches long. Fortunately, it did not explode.

<h3>Participating Employees Jointly Protest: Method for Distributing Surplus Materials; Question Supply Bureau by Presenting Three Reasons</h3>
<p>Following the Material Supply Bureau's announcement of changes to its recent method of preferentially distributing surplus materials to public and private school personnel in the city, the entire staff of the Municipal Council Secretariat sent a joint letter to Jiang Biao, the director of the Material Supply Bureau, yesterday. They argued that the Bureau's claim that the distribution order could not be maintained was due to the inadequacy of the previous method. The fault did not lie with the public and private school personnel who were entitled to the benefits. Furthermore, the recently changed ten-item method was tantamount to restricting and shackling the special rights granted to public and private school personnel by the state. This phenomenon should be carefully considered and corrected. The letter concluded by requesting that the Material Supply Bureau take into consideration the government's intentions in distributing materials in the future, prioritize the welfare of public and private school personnel, and fulfill their responsibilities by clearly handling matters in a reasonable manner to comfort those who are eagerly waiting. Excerpts of the three reasons listed in the original letter are as follows:</p>
<p>Difficult to Comply with the Urgent Deadline</p>
<p>(1) Public and private school personnel are organized citizens with clear identities, each with an organization, a structure, and a commanding officer. The distribution of materials could have been handled very simply by each organization's leader submitting a roster to your bureau each month to complete the purchase procedures. The allocation of daily necessities to public and private school personnel in this city has been well-established for some time, and there has never been any phenomenon of disorderly order or inability to maintain the system. However, your bureau does not do this. Instead, it forces more than 100,000 public and private school personnel to personally squeeze in to purchase materials during the short time on Saturdays and Sundays. Not only is it difficult to choose under crowded conditions, but most people gain nothing and spend a lot of time and effort. The current method, in principle, seems to be improved, but the losses of public and private school personnel are considerable. For the allocation of materials in October, a notice requires each organization to complete the purchase procedures at your bureau before the 15th of this month. The staff of each organization has internal and external duties, and the organization of the institution has both upper and lower levels. Within a short period of five days, each organization must carry out various procedures such as notification, investigation, and registration with the staff. It is absolutely impossible for each organization to do this in a forced manner.</p>
<p>What is the Basis for Adjusting the Allocation Price?</p>
<p>(2) The price of the allocated materials will be adjusted at any time according to the treatment of public and private school personnel. It is unknown what the basis is. If it is said that the price of allocated materials must be adjusted, how can the price change be known to be exactly in line with the treatment of public and private school personnel? If it is said that they must use a part of their salary to buy surplus materials, why doesn't the government directly deduct a part of the salary of public and private school personnel and compensate them with surplus materials? Moreover, the price adjustment after October is "average," increasing by half of the original price. There must be some items that have increased by more than half, and some items that have increased by less than half. How can it be guaranteed that items that are more practical for the families of public and private school personnel will not increase by more than half, and that items that are not practical will not increase by less than half? Moreover, the adjustment of the treatment of public and private school personnel is only seen in the newspaper that it will increase by half from November, and the order has not yet been issued. However, the materials allocated by your bureau must start to increase in price from October. Regarding this point, it is unknown how your bureau justifies itself.</p>
<p>Where is the True Intention of Compensation for Damages?</p>
<p>(3) Item 9 of the public notice method states: "For the convenience of both parties in the sale and purchase, please observe order and purchase in accordance with the item distribution notice. In order to prevent unscrupulous people from posing as public and private school personnel to seize the opportunity to purchase and disturb the store, please also ask the on-site public and private school personnel to jointly assist the police in correcting and stopping them. If any disturbance occurs that causes the departments (stores) to suffer material losses, the selling price will be increased once or twice for compensation, and after three times, this preferential purchase method will be stopped." The meaning of these words is obscure, and I sincerely do not know what the true intention is. If you try to interpret it literally, it is especially out of order. Since each organization purchases in order according to the notification form, how can a disturbance occur? Moreover, once your bureau's materials are damaged, the selling price must be increased once or twice to compensate. Three times will stop this preferential distribution method. It is also unknown what it means. If someone damages your bureau's materials, your bureau can directly bring them to justice or investigate the responsibility for damages. How can you order the general public who have not received the materials to compensate jointly?</p>

<h3>Rice Panic Gradually Subsides: White Rice Reduced to 500 Yuan per Stone</h3>
<p>The rice market officially resumed trading yesterday, and there were also many arrivals, totaling 2,572 stones and 5 dou in the north and south markets. The North Market had 1,136 stones, and the South Market had 1,436 stones and 5 dou. The market conditions were high at first and then low. The North Market's white rice opened at 520 yuan and closed at 550 yuan. The South Market's white rice opened at 550 yuan, and the price outside the market dropped to 500 yuan, but no one was interested. Credit is extremely tight, and the shadow interest rate is still high. A large amount of rice from other ports and foreign rice is being shipped to Shanghai, so people continue to look down on the market. The rice panic may be completely relieved next week.</p>
<h3>The Cash Shortage Remains Severe</h3>
<p>The Gold Yuan Supervisory Committee Holds a Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The issuance limit of the Gold Yuan remains at the original amount of 2 billion before the formal arrival of the amended regulations in Shanghai, hence the cash shortage on the market remains severe. Yesterday, many national banks and commercial banks went to the Central Bank to withdraw funds, but the Issuing Bureau and the Business Bureau found it difficult to cope. Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau, went to Yu Hongjun's residence to request instructions.</p>
<p>Related sources revealed: After the official price of gold and silver increased, there is a surplus in the issuance quota. Once the official document arrives in Shanghai, the issuance limit will inevitably increase, and the cash shortage can be resolved at that time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Gold Yuan Issuance Supervisory Committee also convened a meeting yesterday afternoon. All members, including Li Ming, attended. According to the amended regulations, future issuance figures will only be reported to the Executive Yuan on a monthly basis and will not be publicly announced.</p>
<p>National Bank Executives Summoned to Beijing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the announcement of the amended Gold Yuan issuance regulations, Finance Minister Xu Kan telegraphed Central Bank officials to Beijing to discuss the technical issues of implementation. Because both the President and Vice President of the Central Bank were on vacation, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, Wang Zishuang, Shao Zenghua, Wu Changfu, and others went instead. It is expected that after the officials return to Shanghai, decisions can be made on the implementation of gold and silver trading and the various provisions in the new regulations.</p>
<p>Money Supply Slightly Eases, Interest Rates Adjusted</p>
<p>The money supply in the market was slightly eased yesterday, despite being a weekend. Foreign remittances poured in, and people's confidence slightly improved due to the amendment of the Gold Yuan issuance regulations. The demand for funds was not as high as in the past. However, the underground interest rates in the market remained high, approximately 50 to 80 yuan per day, equivalent to 1.5 to 2.4 yuan per month. Cash funds are still very scarce.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Monetary Industry Joint Preparatory Committee, along with the Shanghai Banks, Native Banks, and Trust Companies Association, in view of the rapid rise in underground market interest rates, has specially adjusted the interest rate listings of their respective associations to adapt to the situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Deposit daily interest: 4.5 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.135 yuan per month, an increase of 0.045 yuan from the original rate.</p>
<p>(2) Loan daily interest: 13 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.39 yuan per month, an increase of 0.12 yuan from the original rate.</p>
<p>(3) Interbank daily interest: 11 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.33 yuan per month, an increase of 0.105 yuan from the original rate.</p>
<p>(4) Public Treasury bond daily interest: 11 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to 0.33 yuan per month, an increase of 0.105 yuan from the original rate.</p>
<p>Newly Minted Coins to be Issued Soon</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the amended Gold Yuan issuance regulations, the Central Mint has been actively preparing to mint coins. It is expected that they will be officially issued by the end of this month. The new regulations stipulate that subsidiary coins from 1 fen to 5 jiao will be minted with copper and nickel respectively, so the 5 jiao silver coins, although some have been minted, will not be issued in practice. However, as of now, no formal instructions have been received from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>People's Foreign Exchange Deposits Should Still be Transferred to the National Bank</h3>
<p>After the government announced the policy allowing people to hold gold, silver, and foreign currencies, there was a question of whether the previous government regulations on reporting and transferring people's foreign exchange should continue to be implemented. According to relevant sources: The new regulations announced yesterday stipulate that deposits of gold, silver, and foreign currencies must be handled by banks designated by the Central Bank, so it is beyond doubt that non-designated banks are not allowed to accept such deposits. It is also inevitable that all past foreign exchange deposits should still be transferred.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Settlements Calculated at a Ratio of 1:20</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Export-Import Control Committee held an important meeting yesterday morning to discuss the promotion of the import and export trade settlement system after the change in the Gold Yuan exchange rate. It was decided that henceforth, all import and export settlements will be calculated at a ratio of 1:20. As for other trade reforms, they will be implemented after the official order arrives.</p>
<h3>Prices of Our Export Goods Stable Overseas</h3>
<p>Price Limits for Bristles and Straw Hats Changed</p>
<p>According to the Export-Import Control Committee: In the past week, the prices of our major export goods have been extremely stable overseas, so the export price limits have not changed in general, except for bristles and straw hats.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Rises on Increased Buying; Cotton Cloth Firm Then Weak</h3>
<p>The external asking price in the yarn market was weak due to tight credit and slow sales. 42-count fine yarn (Blue Phoenix brand) fell to 7,600-7,700 yuan. Near closing time, buying increased from all sides and the asking price suddenly rebounded, rising to 9,000 yuan, an increase of 1,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. The overall trend for the day was positive, with fine yarn up 1,300-1,500 yuan due to competition from local replicating industries, while coarse yarn only rose 400-500 yuan.</p>
<p>The external asking price in the cotton cloth market was mediocre at the beginning. Rumors circulated that speculative funds were coming to Shanghai and buyers were eagerly searching. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was initially offered at 260 yuan, but then the asking price gradually fell to 240 yuan due to increased selling. Near noon, it rebounded to 265 yuan and finally closed at 310 yuan, an increase of 45 yuan compared to before the holiday.</p>
<p>Downstream Cotton Market</p>
<p>There were no transactions in the raw cotton market yesterday and no prices were quoted. Although credit in the market was slightly easier, there were still shortages of funds, leading to a sluggish market. Only Zhoupu seed cotton was traded, with prices quoted at 250 yuan in the morning, falling to 230 yuan. In the afternoon, due to some firms needing to settle accounts on Saturday, the asking price continued to decline, reaching a low of 210 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour, Oil, and Grain Plunge, Transactions Gradually Returning to Normal</h3>
<p>The decline in edible oil prices was also sharp. After the announcement of the amended Gold Yuan issuance plan, everyone believed that prices would fall, and people were extremely pessimistic. Soybean oil fell to 700 yuan yesterday, rapeseed oil fell by another 100 yuan, raw oil fell by 50 yuan, and soybean cake fell by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour prices also continued to fall. "Battleship" flour opened at 125 yuan, a decrease of 35 yuan from the previous day. Other "Red Bee" and "Old Car" brands also started trading for the first time yesterday. All outlets also supplied flour starting yesterday.</p>
<p>More miscellaneous grains were traded. Corn was stable, while broad beans and white beans each fell by 20 yuan, shelled peanuts fell by 10 yuan, and the rest were stable. Arrivals were also more abundant than before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Initially High, Then Rebounded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw slightly easier credit within the industry, and speculative funds from other regions poured into Shanghai. Local firms also participated in the buying, and market sentiment was quite firm. Under the influence of speculative buying, floating orders rose one after another. However, rumors that various import companies were still opening allocations and that the allocated prices would be suppressed caused a sudden shift in sentiment. Various firms stopped buying and started selling, and prices softened again at the close. No. 4 and 5 white refined sugar initially traded at 400 yuan ex-customs, but sentiment turned from firm to weak in the middle of the day, and prices fell sharply, closing at 350 yuan. Coarse and medium-grade sugar initially rose and then declined, while the rest uniformly fell by 30-50 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Huainan Railway, Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Dou Baiping</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiulonggang, August 8] The Huainan Railway and the Huainan Coal Mine are twin brothers under the jurisdiction of the Huainan Mining and Railway Co., Ltd. They are closely related and complement each other. Without the railway, the coal mine would suffocate. Without the mine, the railway would decline. Today, the business of both the mining and railway bureaus is thriving because these two brothers are working hand in hand, advancing toward a fixed goal.</p>
<p>A Page of History Today, the mine is producing coal every day and night, while the railway is not fully operational. Not only is the mine anxious, but the entire province of Anhui is calling for it in vain. This railway starts from Tianjia'an on the north bank of the Huai River to Yuxi on the north bank of the Yangtze River, with a total length of 214 kilometers. Although it has only been around for more than ten years, it has endured many hardships. Just like a child from a poor family, it was malnourished in the womb, had congenital deficiencies, and suffered family changes after birth, resulting in developmental disorders. Even today, it has not developed healthily, and even has physical defects. Although the nanny is taking extra care of it, difficulties still exist.</p>
<p>When planning to build this railway, the original line only ran from the mine to Bengbu to connect with the Jinpu Railway for transporting coal. However, because it would be restricted by the Jinpu Railway, it was decided to extend it to the riverbank to seek free development. Initially, the Construction Committee allocated 500,000 yuan from the proceeds of the sale of the Changxing Coal Mine Company to be used as a road-building fund. In 1933, because the funds were insufficient, the construction committee mortgaged all the assets of the Qi Tang Weir Power Plant, the Capital Power Plant, and the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau to borrow 3 million yuan from the Shanghai banking group, of which 1.28 million yuan was used to complete the Huainan Mine to Hefei project. In 1934, another 3.7 million yuan was borrowed, and the road was finally completed. On January 20, 1936, the entire line was opened to traffic. At this time, the daily output of coal was 1,200 tons, and the transportation problem was solved.</p>
<p>The Storm Came Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the storm came. Only one and a half years after opening, the Anti-Japanese War broke out. In October 1937, it was ordered to be destroyed. This railway, which occupied 21,442 mu of land, suddenly became useless land. In 1939, the Japanese restored its use for looting coal, and later dismantled the 188-kilometer track from Shuijiahu to Yuxi and moved it to build a branch line from Shuijiahu to Bengbu, which was directly under the jurisdiction of the "Central China Railway Management Committee". After the Japanese surrender, the Shuibeng branch line was completely destroyed by bandits. When Director Wu Jingqing and Deputy Director Hu Weizhong came to take over, there were only 27 kilometers of railway from Tianjia'an to Shuijiahu, three dilapidated stations, an unfinished machine shop, and 300 dilapidated vehicles. Although the restoration of the Huainan Railway was constantly talked about, where was the money? The company itself borrowed money from all sides. After three years, the section from Shuijiahu to Hefei (70 kilometers) was restored and opened to traffic on this year's Double Ten Festival. In our country, where the transportation industry is not well developed, the Huainan Mining and Railway Company has encountered unexpected difficulties due to objective and subjective limitations.</p>
<p>Problems with the Entire Line The entire country is in turmoil, and people's lives have been unstable, resulting in insufficient means of transportation. The Jianghuai Plain relies on the full operation of the Huainan Railway for external transportation. Since the Shuijia-Hefei section opened, together with the Shui-Tian and Shui-Zha sections, it carries 9,000 passengers per day, and even more freight. However, the Hefei-Yuxi section is not open, and the Jianghuai Plain still feels suffocated. Coal transportation is particularly difficult at this stage. From the outside and from within, this road must be quickly repaired. Although the materials for the Hefei-Chaoxian restoration are not a problem and track laying is underway, the materials for the Chaoxian-Yuxi (50 kilometers) section are still not available. This may seem insignificant to the state-owned major railways, but it is not so simple for Huainan itself, especially in today's failing economy. The road must be repaired. Given the current situation, there are concerns about obtaining loans, and business profits are limited and cannot be used for major purposes. The company has not forgotten the road restoration in any case. According to Deputy Director Hu Weizhong, if money is not a problem, the Hefei-Chaoxian section is expected to open to traffic by the Lunar New Year, and the road should reach Yuxi on the river by the time people are drinking realgar wine next year. The reporter wishes the Railway Bureau's plan to be completed on schedule, so that external transportation in the Jianghuai region will no longer be suffocated, and coal can be transported to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, allowing all large and small chimneys to smoke!</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau Machine Shop Speeds Up Restoration Amidst the sound of railway restoration, the contribution of the Railway Bureau Machine Shop cannot be ignored. The reporter was led on a tour by Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau Ning Shufan and Director of the Machine Shop Liu Xinmin. The shop includes locomotive, boiler, foundry, forging, vehicle, electrical, and machining workshops. There are more than 200 pieces of machinery, large and small, and more than 50 skilled workers who are dedicated to their work, focused on repair and manufacturing, and operating in a tense, serious, and disciplined manner. In addition to repairing locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, they also repair ships, automobiles, and mining machinery. Organizationally, it is now divided into two sections: the first machine shop, specializing in the repair and manufacture of vehicle parts; and the second machine shop, specializing in the repair and manufacture of locomotive parts, with 53 staff members managing the work of 500 workers. Equipment and raw materials limit development. Wheel axles and wheel rims cannot be made locally and must be purchased from abroad, but the beautiful first- and second-class passenger cars speeding on the railways today are assembled here.</p>
<p>In the face of the current situation, where the flames of war are raging and the situation in the Huai River region is tense, there is inevitably concern for the mine and the railway. However, the authorities of the mine and railway do not consider these issues. When talking to the reporter, they said: "Currently, we will do what we can. We must strive to complete the entire line." Their determination and courage in construction are commendable and praiseworthy.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Stipulates Rickshaw Fares, Organizes Gruel, Rice, and Clothing Distribution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenhai, December 12] The County Labor-Management Arbitration Committee convened its eighth committee meeting on the 11th, and after deliberation, decided: (1) Wages in all industries that were calculated in grain before "August 19" will continue to be calculated in grain. (2) The wages for porters will be increased by 21 times compared to the wages decided at the seventh arbitration.

<p>[Another Report] With the approach of winter, the county's Winter Relief Committee was formally established yesterday. County Magistrate Jiang personally presided over the first committee meeting and decided to implement four relief programs starting from December 1: distributing porridge, rice, and clothing, and establishing shelters. At the same time, starting from the 16th of this month, fundraising will be expanded to 100,000 Gold Yuan, targeting five sectors: wealthy households, hotels, restaurants, ships, and automobiles, to ensure sufficient funding. In addition, the Provincial Social Affairs Office has allocated winter relief clothing to the county, including 170 large cotton vests and 170 small ones, which have been collected and are on their way to Zhenhai. They will be distributed to the poor to protect them from the cold on a scheduled basis. Furthermore, bandit Zhou Guiliang (also known as Ju Bin) was arrested by Luo Shusheng, the deputy commander of the county security regiment, in Zhanqi, at the border between Zhenhai and Yin County, and was handed over to the county on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Changzhou's Rice Reserves Exhausted; Middle Peasants Not Allowed to Transport Grain Out</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, December 12] Recently, the county's rice reserves have been extremely depleted, and rural goods have not yet been effectively distributed. Various merchants and firms are purchasing large quantities of goods from Wuhu and Liyang, but they are currently being blocked on the way. Rice shops are still closed. Although there are underground transactions, there is a real shortage of goods. On the 10th, the public sale office in Ximen was crowded with people, and two shi of rice were emptied. In the afternoon, the county government convened an economic conference and decided that all 20,000 shi of grain borrowed by middle peasants in Changzhou from four firms, including Chengyuxin and Yicheng, and more than 10,000 shi of grain claimed by the Central Cooperative Bank to be processed in Changzhou, will be temporarily suspended from export to stabilize the grain market and reassure the people.</p>

<h3>Three Snakes, Dragon, Tiger, Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>After the fragrance of sweet osmanthus and the yellow chrysanthemum season, it is the season for the Yangcheng Lake hairy crab to be on the market in Jiangnan. However, in the cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau in South China, the "Three Snakes, Dragon, Tiger Association" begins to serve customers. The so-called "three snakes" refers to the three poisonous snakes of gold-ringed krait, cobra, and green tree snake. It is said that the gold-ringed krait tonifies the legs, the cobra tonifies the middle body, and the green tree snake tonifies the head. The snake's venom is secreted from the gums. The snake catcher first removes the snake's fangs, so the snake has no way to release venom.</p>
<p>To cook the snake, first take the gall bladder, skin it, debone it, and shred it. Then add shredded dried shiitake mushrooms, tree ears, bamboo shoots, ham, and dried tangerine peel. Stew it. When eating, add some fresh lemon leaf shreds as a flavoring. Each person receives a small bowl to eat. The taste is extremely delicious. If the host does not explain in advance, the first-time eater will never know it is snake soup, but will only praise the delicious flavor.</p>
<p>Snake bile is drunk with wine. It is sweet and cool in nature, without a bitter taste. It has the function of dispelling wind and removing dampness. It can be prepared with dried tangerine peel, pepper, ginger, etc., or steeped in wine. The effect is the same.</p>
<p>If cooking snake with masked palm civet (wild cat), black-boned chicken, etc., it is called the "Three Snakes, Dragon, Tiger, Phoenix" grand meeting. There are also places that sell stewed masked palm civet separately, which is also a tonic in winter.</p>
<p>Because the number of snake eaters in Guangdong increases every year, the province's snake production has decreased. In recent years, snakes have mostly been captured and sold from Guangxi. Some cunning restaurants use water snake or toad meat to impersonate it. The taste is the same, but the effect is different.</p>
<p>Some sellers of snake meat, fearing that customers will say that they are selling fakes, will bring live snakes from a lead wire basket and slaughter them in front of them, or leave some of the skin untanned after slaughtering the snake to prove its authenticity. This refers to the full set of fresh three snakes.</p>
<p>Two or three days after eating snake, the skin pores on the body seem to secrete a very thin liquid. It is felt when changing underwear or bathing. This is the effect of snake dispelling wind and removing dampness. Snake meat is rich in protein. It is very beneficial for people who are weak.</p>
<p>In addition to the three snakes, there is also the large gold-spotted snake, which is more than ten feet long and as thick as a person's arm. Three or four days before slaughtering the snake, it is advertised. Because the snake weighs dozens of kilograms, it is not easy to slaughter and sell it unless there are many customers. Its cooking is similar to that of the three snakes, but the value is higher than the three snakes, because it is not common to catch.</p>
<p>(A few days ago, when talking about eating dog meat, I forgot to write about the taboo, that is, anyone who eats dog meat must absolutely not eat mung bean soup (porridge) within twelve hours, otherwise the dog meat will swell in the intestines and stomach, causing severe pain in mild cases and death in severe cases. This is a taboo that dog meat eaters should remember.)</p>
<h3>Public Opinion Polls</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jian</p>
<p>Recently, Truman's unexpected victory in the US presidential election astonished and dismayed many political observers and public opinion polling organizations. The Gallup poll, which has a strong international reputation, also declared its failure. Therefore, poll expert Mr. Gallup had to quip, "Such closely contested elections occur only once in a generation, often misleading pollsters." (United Press International, New York, 3rd of this month) Now, Mr. Gallup is studying the reasons for the polling failure. I would like to briefly introduce the public opinion polling organizations in the United States here:</p>
<p>Public opinion polling is essentially an applied technique in social psychology, seeking a comprehensive and concrete conclusion representing group activities from a small number of subjects. It employs systematic methods to ask interviewees a number of concise and to-the-point questions. The question formats include question-and-answer, true-false, and multiple-choice, used in various combinations. The accuracy of the poll does not depend on the number of people interviewed, but on the carefully selected representative individuals. If the selection is appropriate, a few hundred voters can predict the national election. American public opinion polling organizations generally poll between 1,500 and 5,000 people. Gallup often uses 3,000 people, but sometimes uses 60,000.</p>
<p>Among American public opinion polling organizations, the most reputable is undoubtedly the "American Institute of Public Opinion" founded by Gallup in 1935. In addition, the public opinion polls conducted by Fortune magazine and Princeton University are also well-known. The funding for most American public opinion polling organizations is provided by newspapers, and they are run by universities or semi-public organizations. Gallup's funding comes from more than one hundred newspapers across the United States, Fortune magazine's poll funding is provided by the company, and the Princeton University Office of Public Opinion Research's funding comes from grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
<p>Early public opinion polls were conducted by mailing postcards, but only about a quarter were returned. Therefore, in recent years, most have switched to interviewers who visit homes directly. Less than one-tenth of people refuse to be interviewed. Gallup has 1,200 field interviewers distributed throughout the United States, 200 each in the United Kingdom and Canada, and about 150 in Australia. A single public opinion poll takes ten days across the United States. The United Kingdom is smaller, so it can be completed in four or five days. Gallup's interviewers are all university graduates, and they all have regular jobs. Public opinion polling is a part-time job.</p>
<p>After the interview work is completed, interviewers from each district send the answers back. After a process of collecting, statistically analyzing, and verifying the data, the polling organization officially publishes the results. American newspapers treat reports from public opinion polls like news, selecting the best to publish. If someone believes that the polling report is inaccurate or biased, the public opinion polling organization welcomes verification to clarify the truth and demonstrate an impartial and unbiased stance.</p>
<h3>Trial by Ordeal, Trial by Combat, Trial by Battle</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>In Halm's "History of Medieval Europe," on page 129, there is an introduction to the barbaric methods of trying cases.</p>
<p>The first is "Trial by Ordeal": This is different from the current "extorting confessions by torture." Instead, for criminals already sentenced to death, before execution, the person sentenced to death could request to "go through fire and water." If they were not injured, it was considered a divine blessing, and they could be spared death, only to be exiled.</p>
<p>The second is "Trial by Combat": After the judge accepted the case, if there was no clear evidence for judgment, the plaintiff and defendant would decide by duel. Lawsuits between nobles were fought on horseback, with lances, and wearing armor. Lawsuits between commoners were fought on foot with clubs. In lawsuits involving women or monks, each would send a representative to fight. If the case being disputed was a civil matter, then the loser of the duel would be considered to have lost the lawsuit. In addition to giving up the object of their dispute, they would also have to pay a fine. If a representative (representing a woman or monk) participated in the duel, then the loser would have one hand chopped off, to prevent these hired duelists from being bribed by the other party. If the case being disputed was criminal, the defendant who lost the duel would be considered to have lost the lawsuit. If the defendant won, then the plaintiff would have to suffer the punishment that the defendant would have received if they had lost.</p>
<p>The third is "Trial by Battle": If the defendant in a criminal case did not accept the verdict, they could appeal to the highest feudal court. However, the defendant who did not accept the initial verdict had to risk "Trial by Battle." The so-called "Trial by Battle" was that the defendant had to fight against all the personnel of the lower court (the initial trial court), one by one. If they could win each battle, then the judges of that court would be sentenced to death, and the court would not be allowed to be established again. If the defendant who initiated the "Trial by Battle" lost even once in the battle, they would be immediately executed.</p>
<h3>Green Crow</h3>
<p>— Ma Qin Zhanweng</p>
<p>Unable to dispel the siege with songs of horses and wind, ten thousand wells of the Jianghuai enter misty rain. In desolate villages, tigers are full and the exhausted people are all gone. In night tents, the thunderous joy of brave warriors returns. The two borders divide the power of the world in half. The customs of the four barbarians have changed for a hundred years. White foxes leap and yellow foxes stand. The green bird comes from the west, I fear it is weary from flying.</p>
<h3>Mountain Moving Ballad</h3>
<p>It is said that an old man in Gan said to people: The people of Jiangxi do not want Mount Lu, it would be best to move this mountain away. Inspired to write this.</p>
<p>Too much trouble at my door because of this famous mountain, especially since cloud carriages come and go as they please. The old man's song is endless, of all the mountains in the world, the Five Sacred Mountains should be completely removed.</p>
<h3>In Praise of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>A month or two ago, I wrote an article "The Difficulty of Quitting Smoking" which was published in "Free Talk." At that time, because cigarettes were too expensive, I advocated smoking water pipes, and many readers expressed sympathy for me. But I never quit cigarettes. Today, times are different, and cigarettes are becoming more expensive day by day, while the income of poor scholars is decreasing day by day. Buying cigarettes even requires secretly going to the black market, and relying on personal connections. All my life, I have been proud and unyielding, unwilling to ask for help from others. But I would rather have to rely on others for cigarettes. Moreover, I am not a die-hard addict. Since buying cigarettes is very difficult and my purse is also shy, I have been nagged by my wife countless times for smoking, and I don't know how many times I have burned holes in my clothes. Today, when I finished my last cigarette, I decided to quit smoking again. As for whether quitting smoking will hinder my writing, I can't care about that. "Articles in troubled times are worthless," so why bother writing sour articles? As for inspiration, the inspiration stimulated by stimulants is not lasting.</p>
<p>Some people say, "A cigarette after a meal is better than being a living immortal." I don't believe it. Didn't Ji Kang also say, "Immortals can be learned"? But what was his result? Was it really a corpse liberation? I never trust the words of immortals. Others say, "A cigarette in hand, thoughts flow freely," the so-called "endless birth and death seen in the smoke." But I think it is better to be neither born nor die, to close the door and let go. I am determined to quit smoking, to show my determination, my ability, and my perseverance. Heaven and earth, help me and support me. Amen!</p>
<h3>A Match Made in Heaven</h3>
<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>The acquaintance of General Clay, the commander of the US occupation forces in Germany, and his wife, Marjorie McConaughy, was very interesting and can be considered a contemporary celebrity anecdote.</p>
<p>When Clay was still studying at West Point, the beautiful Miss McConaughy went to the military academy to see a friend. She arrived by bus. When the bus stopped, Clay happened to be standing near the bus. When she got off the bus, she accidentally stumbled and fell right into Clay's arms. He helped her up, introduced himself, and the two fell in love at first sight. They got married on the day Clay graduated.</p>
