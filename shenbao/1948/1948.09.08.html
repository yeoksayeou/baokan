<p>〔本報訊〕財次徐柏園，奉派來滬會同中央銀行督促各商業行莊將外匯資產移存中央銀行，徐氏昨晨到滬，卽赴中央銀行與總裁兪鴻鈞，副總裁劉攻芸，金管局長林崇墉等邀請各商業銀行首腦，分別於上下午談話，受邀者有浙江實業，浙江興業，上海聯合，中南，金城，中國實業，中國國貨，聚興誠，廣東等十家銀行負責人李馥蓀，徐寄廎，戴銘禮，錢新之，徐國懋，胡惠春，楊錫之等。徐氏分別鄭重吿以各行所存外匯，外幣及持有之國外存款，股票，公債，黃金，白銀等，務必於限期前全部抄列詳帳呈報政府。將來是否全部移存，政府當可另行考慮，此外，並詳談移存辦法聞最遲於今日下午以前，核定各行莊所有外匯移存數額及移存辦法。</p>
<p>〔聯合徵信所訊〕關於商業行莊外匯移存國行事，據銀行公會理事長李銘表示：一切決遵照政府法令辦理，今與兪總裁，徐次長會商決定，分批移存，首批八日卽送交中央銀行，報載商業銀行卽凑集一千萬美元賣給中央銀行，圖了此事，李氏有所解釋，李氏稱：此事曾有決定，係小銀行擬售與中央銀行，作爲增資資金，與移存爲兩事，現決遵政府法令辦理前說當已作罷，至銀行增資問題，各行莊並不感覺困難，因增資數字，已較原定額度減輕半數，故應行增資部份，數字並不爲大。</p>
<p>〔中央社本巿訊〕銀行商業同業公會理事長李馥蓀，昨晨邀集各理事談話，對遵令移存外匯資產事，有所檢討，經決議尅日中公會具文通知各會員，一體遵照辦理，其辦法先由各行莊將原有外匯資產依據賬册開列者，造具淸單，彙交公會，而由該會呈送國行，辦理登記手續。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕商業行莊外匯資產及黃金·白銀繳存央行問題，據此間經財有關方面人士透露：如各行莊負責人有故違是項法令者，其經營業務或將受停止之處分。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據財政界息：近有不法商業行莊以大量資產逃避至香港情事，此等行莊經營者，有將其全部或大部資財變賣匯至廣州，，再由廣州　購港幣，藉此將資金逃至香港，財政當局對此已極爲注意，最近即將有嚴密辦法公布施行。</p>
<h3>徐柏園談　政府疏導游資　考慮發行短期庫券金圓公債　國人持有外匯即將舉辦申報</h3>

<h3>政府通盤整理舊債　對國庫負担及持券人利益兼籌並顧　陳炳章談整舊債兩點意義</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕財部依照總統頒布財經緊急處分令之規定，於四日曾提經政院臨時政務會議通過法幣公債及外幣債券處理辦法及卅七年整理公債發行原則。據財部公債司長陳炳章稱：政府此次通過整理舊債之意義，可分下列二點：（一）關於外幣債劵者，按卅六年短期庫券及廿七·廿九·卅一年外幣公債，其到期本息之還付，原係依照中央銀行外匯官價（每一美元折合法幣一萬二千元）折付法幣，上年八月外匯管理辦法改訂後，政府爲維護持劵人利益計，改按指定銀行美金市價折付法幣，本年六月結匯證明書制度實行後，京·滬等地銀行業公會均具呈本部，對於外幣債劵建議卽按平衡會結匯率（每一美元折合法幣四十七萬四千元），全部提前一次收回，嗣卅六年短期庫劵，美金公債基金監理委員會及全國銀行業公會又來函建議，按照平衡會結匯率加結匯證明書市價（當時約四五百萬元），按期債還本息，以上兩項建議，政府本可酌採實行，現在政府爲顧及持票人保持幣値之願望，決定外幣債劵票面概照法定兌換率計算，每一美元折合金圓四圓，亦卽法幣一千二百萬元，以較各方所建議之希望實已優過數成之多，足證政府維持債信之努力，同時，並爲紓緩國庫當前負担起見，決定將四稱外幣債券按照法定匯兌率換發金圓公債，新債之償還年限雖較舊債尙餘償期略有延長，但所延長約計二年半至六年而已，而新債兌付便利，且可保持對美金之匯兌率。此項處理辦法，原係依照總統緊急處分令而擬訂，對於持劵人之利益及國庫之負担，可謂兼籌並顧，殊屬兩有裨益。（二）關於法幣公債者，按法幣公債之本息，向係依照條例規定，按票面法幣數額一兌一還付，抗戰期間在後方亦係照此辦理，蓋政府公債與普通借貸性質不同，政府募銷公債，所得款項，均係隨時用作國家之開支，非如跟行企業可將吸收之存款作營利之運用，况公債債票可以自由移轉流通，目前持有人未必均係原認購人，是以復員以來，各地法院對戰前銀行存款及私人借貸增倍償還各訟案，其判決標準，雖因時間前後而有出入，但對公債均經特別提出「除外」，不在加倍償還之列，現在幣制改革，政府爲體念持票人以往購債助國之熱忱，不惜加重國庫負担，毅然特定予以分級加倍償付，以示優待，具見維護持票人利益之至意，抑有進者，查各種法幣公債，依其原定償期尙餘期間計算，短者尙有數年，長者竟達卅三年餘之久，現在政府不問其尙餘償期長短，一律並予提前一次淸償，至所定分級加還之倍數，最多二萬七千倍，最少一千倍，如以戰前發行各債爲例，較之本年八月十九日上海統一公債暗市價格且有過之無不及，假定與銀行業戰前存款放款淸償條例附表加成計算，每元應還本利和數額比較，則各種公債加倍償還之數，均約增至八倍之多，政府在財政極端困難之際，作此決定，可謂已盡其最火之能事。</p>
<p>陳氏最後表示，歐美各國每遇對外戰爭或重火變異之非常時期，通貨價値恒有貶落，然對政府公債則罕見有加倍償付之事實，亦鮮聞其人民有加倍償還之要求，第一次歐戰後，法國法郎貶値甚鉅，其人民念及政府財政之困難，還將所持之債票集中於廣塲，當衆予以焚燬，以示獻助國家之誠意，其愛國心情，至可感動。我國抗戰巨八年餘之久，政府在抗戰前後所發公債，承各地愛國人士踴躍認購，協助國家渡過難關，而海外僑胞以其平日節衣縮食之餘資遠道匯購，其急公好義，眷懷祖國之精神，尤足表揚我民族之美德。但戰爭持久，破壤重大，全國人民生命財產之損失不可勝計，一部份公債特票人如因通貨貶値致遭損失，亦屬戰爭不可避免之事實，現在政府兼籌並顯，通盤整理舊債，在幣制改革伊始，財政仍屬困難之際，對法幣公債則分級加倍升値，並予提前淸償，對外幣債券，則提高匯率，撥發新債，而政府亦有劃一償付手續，簡化債務行政之便利，誠屬一舉數得。深信各舊債持有人必能體念政府維護至意，一本過去愛國熱誠，擁護此項施策，以促使國家財政迅速步入穩健之途。</p>

<h3>弔捷克國殤</h3>
<p>捷克開國元動貝奈斯先生，於本月三日撒手長逝：今天捷克正在爲貝奈斯先生舉行國葬。貝氏之死，震動了世界的每一個角落，不僅布拉格的民衆悲傷到痛哭流涕，全世界各國的人民，對於這位終身爲祖國自由民主和平而艱苦奮鬥的巨人的逝世，都在悼惜讚歎·貝氏的逝世，的確不祗是捷克一國的損失，實在是全世界的一大損失。自今年二月捷克政變外長馬薩里克自殺之後，貝氏處境的困難，早爲全世界民主國家所關切。今年三月，曾一度盛傳貝氏憂憤自殺，後來又謠傳他體弱病重。一直到六月七日貝氏辭去總統之職，我們才知道他依然健在人間，蟄居布拉格的郊外，從事其寫作大戰回憶錄的生涯。殊不料時隔三月，貝奈斯先生果眞與世長辭了！</p>
<p>今天捷克的國殤，其全國人民悲痛情形，眞所謂「如喪考妣」，自動前往瞻仰貝氏遺容的民衆，確可說得萬人空巷。這固是貝氏應有的「身後哀榮」，但是捷克人民的眞正意向，也可以從這次貝氏舉行國葬的空前盛况中見之。</p>
<p>貝氏的一生，可以說完全爲了他祖國的自由·民主·與和平·貝氏早歲雖然也和他人一樣，由小學而中學，由中學而大學，專門研究哲學，但在布拉格大學中，獲得其老師馬薩里克（捷克國父，卽第一任總統）的薰陶，後來便獻身於革命。貝氏雖也負笈於巴黎倫敦，但是他的目的，乃在硏究奧捷問題，一俟學成，卽返布拉格入母校執敎，並與馬薩里克組織「現實黨」，師生合作，共同鼓吹捷克復國的理論。所以貝奈斯先生從小就是一個忠愛國家的有爲靑年。</p>
<p>在馬薩里克領　捷克復國期間，貝氏一直是斡的外交工作。「捷克民族委員會」於一九一五年在巴黎成立時，貝氏卽擔任該會的書記長，，策劃捷克復國的大計，並組織國際情報及宣傳的機關。他初次嘗試的成功，就是「民族委員會」的獲得協約國的承認，視爲捷克的臨時政府。一九一八年十月底，馬薩里克遄返布拉格，對外宣佈獨立，馬氏自任第一任總統，貝氏爲外長，仍留在巴黎，出席凡爾賽和會，運用他的外交手腕，替祖國爭回不少的權益，使世人再也不相信「弱國無外交」的陳腐觀念。但是到了一九三五年，馬薩里克總統辭職，由貝氏繼任第二任總統之後，不僅捷克國家多難，天天在風雨飄搖之中，而且貝氏的命運也多坎坷，適逢納粹德國侵略勢力的勃興，它不僅對於奧地利波蘭懷有野心，而且對於捷克也垂涎已久。貝氏憑其遠大的眼光，靈活的外交手段，雖欲聯合英法與蘇聯，共禦德國勢力的向外發展，無如法國總理達拉第與英相張伯倫之流，都是目光極短的人物，竟對希特勒採取綏靖政策，不惜出賣友邦的利益，以致導演出慕尼黑會議的醜劇，使新興的捷克復歸於支離破碎，甚至忠愛祖國的貝奈斯先生，也受不了德國的壓迫而出亡英美。貝氏內心的痛苦，决不是筆墨所能描摹其萬一。</p>
<p>但是貝氏仍能忍人之不能忍，對於捷克的前途依舊樂觀，並預料第二次大戰遲早必將爆發，而爲之積極準備。一九三九年九月，大戰果然爆發，貝氏卽自美赴英，在倫敦組織「流亡政府」，繼續努力捷克的　國運動，他認爲捷克的復國，必有賴於英美與蘇聯三國的協助，缺一不可；故在大戰期間，他不辭勞苦，遠渡重洋，先赴美訪問，後又作莫斯科之行，與蘇聯締結互助條約。一九四五年納粹投降，貝氏於十六日凱旋布拉格，一身宿願，果能全償，不能不稱頌貝氏的光榮功續。所惜貝氏好景不常，戰後默洲局勢的錯綜複雜，愈變愈烈，使捷克也成了世界的縮影。貝氏雖然只知爲自由的民主的和平的捷克而努力，千方百計調處各政黨間的衝突，以謀得國內的和平與民主；但是今年二月政變，貝氏一身的心血完全毁於一旦，不但捷共實行一黨獨裁，而且貝氏在政治上也陷於孤立失據，因此乃引退隱居，鬰鬰而歿。</p>
<p>最近我們在美國出版的民族週報上，看到貝氏的「大戰回憶錄」，益增我們的景仰與欽佩。他不僅是捷克的政治家，外交家，革命家，而且也是一位出類拔萃的國際政治家。他信仰民主，企求自由·渴望和平，憧憬着一個世界的理想，在國內走着中間路綫，在國際上儼然是第三方面，他主張東方與西方應該通力合作，共同締造世界和平·但是事與願違，他的理想都沒有實現，他的努力都沒有成功。現在，貝氏長眠於地下了，連這一座溝通東方與西方的橋樑也折斷了！梁木其壞，哲人其萎，這不僅是捷克的不幸，實在是全世界的不幸！</p>
<h3>平人民團體電中樞　請依法辦理七五案</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平七日電〕自監察委員谷鳳翔，胡文暉「七五」調查報吿及糾舉發表後，傳總司令引咎自責，電請處分。平市各人民團體，以「七五」事件係負責治安之軍警憲依法担當警戒職務，不應負失職處分，特聯銜電請總統·行政·監察兩院長，曁國防部長依法辦理，以昭公道。文云：東北學生不堪奸匪壓迫，間道入關繼續求學，人數衆多臨時湧集，主管機關未能適時安頓，致使流離失所。巿參議會關懷股切，通過議案建議救濟，詎爲同學誤解，釀成七五事件。所有善後事宜，肇事責任正由傅總司令督飭地方指派專人衡情處理。聞監察委員谷鳳翔，胡文暉蒞平調查，日前發表報吿及糾舉書，對於治安當局課以失職之責。傳總司令虛懷引咎，自請處分，全體市民深感詫異。查谷胡二委負之調查報吿，叙述事實與當日情形大致相符，對於事件之責任，擬議則似欠愼密之攷慮。茲將實際情形及法律觀點謹陳意見，敬乞採納：（一）七五事件發生之際，有不良份子混入乘機鼓動，首先發槍出於學生方面，此爲調查報吿所叙述之事實。則事件之責任，應由乘機之不良份子貿之，自不難正確指出。（二）慘案發生之時，係在宣佈戒嚴之後，報吿書中未予注意。緣當時學生四五千人乘衆搗毁參議會，毆辱在塲維持警憲官長，於搗毀參議會後，又赴外交領館所在地之東交民巷包圍許議長住宅，治安當局爲阻止奸匪份子利用機會，在東交民巷特殊環境乘機肇事，基准最高軍事長官，宣吿臨時戒嚴，調派部隊担當戒備。依戒嚴法規宣佈戒嚴之後，軍警帶槍應付緊急局勢，籍以保護一百八十萬市民之安全，及東交民巷中外觀瞻所繫之地區，實爲事理之當然。卽因防止暴動而發生意外，在法律上並不負任何責任，此亦各國之通例。（三）二零八師爲指定担任城防之部隊，宣佈戒嚴後，除調用該部隊外，並無其他武力可資調遺。報吿書中亦謂未應調用野戰部隊祖任市內警戒，似于實際情形不蓋深察。（四）本市學校林立素爲潛伏奸匪份子製造事鍇之基地，證以七五當時已有非東北學生舉旗煽惑公開呌囂，復於七九公開破壞戒嚴令，聚衆遊行請願，高呼「槍斃傳作義」等口號，其爲奸匪從中操縱指使，事極明顯。綜上所述，原報吿及糾舉書對於事實之認定周甚明確，對於責任之誰屬實有未當，對於法律之觀點似尤未盡注意。人民在法律之前應一律平等，不應因學生身份而曲予優容。官吏因職責所在採不得已之措施，尤不應因學生事件而課罪責。傳總司令屏障華北，對東北學生于軍書傍午之中，躬親督導，多方安置，固無責任之可言。治安當局對七五事件亦確盡最大之容忍與努力，更不應有失職之處分。爲使法律之尊嚴不因應付環境而變質，爲使學潮迭起之北平不因軍警不敢充分行使職權而重召混亂，茲特共用電請俯察興情，依法處理，以平民憤而遏亂萌。臨電不勝迫切待命之至。北平市商會，工會，農會，婦女會，敎育會，律部公會，記者公會等同叩。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林七日電〕柏林德共領袖七日宣佈已與西方佔區德國市政府完全絕交，故柏林因之已正式分裂成兩個都巿。在四强軍事總督第七次會議前兩小時，德共召集盟方及德籍新聞記者一百五十人，由李德啓宣佈，市政府移往西方佔區後，社會統一黨（共黨）不擬參加。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林七日電〕蘇佔區之共黨七日宣佈，與西方佔區德人完全斷絕關係，其行動顯在政治上將柏林一切爲二。在蘇軍支持共黨行動小組以暴力衝入市政府後廿四小時，蘇方控制之報紙企圖煽動新暴動，號召共產行動組發動新的巨大遊行，反對「法西斯戰販，及分裂柏林份子」。四軍事總督原定今日下午四時舉行第七次會議，然因新危機之出現，反不甚顯著。官方強調共產暴動對總督會議無直接影響。然美軍事總督要求有關此事之報告，而一般咸恐共產暴徒可能破滅四强共管柏林時機之恢復。</p>

<p>旋市議會議長索爾卽決定在英佔區召開特別會議，除共黨議員外，其他議員大部份均參加。副巿長費頓斯堡在特會中警吿各議員稱，市議會雖衷心希望東四盟國間能成立協議，然亦須提防四國會談之失敗，</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林七日電〕柏林蘇區德警昨日在千名以上共黨衝入市參議會大厦阻止巿參議會開會發生事端後，已將百名以上之人加以逮捕，六十名拘禁於警署。其中有三十名係參議會之衛警，十八名係市政府之官員，十三名係平民，另有數十名之新聞記者則已釋放。市參議會大厦現仍由德警包圍進出口並由警察嚴加管制，出入之人皆須驗明身份證。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬七日電〕義政府對於蘇聯政府指斥該國未能根據義和約中之條款，將議軍艦移交蘇聯一事提出覆文，加以駁斥。蘇方照會中指稱在和約中所指定移交軍艦之一九四八年八月十五日義並未有隻艦交與蘇聯。</p>

<h3>蘇軍官逃亡在英　透露蘇備戰秘密　政治局決策實違反民意</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦六日電〕蘇聯陸軍上校托凱葉夫，豐稱「　幕後之神秘人物」，數日前由本國逃抵倫敦，今日舉行新聞記者招待會，輿會者有西方各報訪員，而塔斯社之訪員亦蒞臨焉。塔斯社訪員斥責托凱葉夫爲賣國者並提出種種問話。托氏答日，「余認暴露蘇聯人民今生活於何種治權之下，此實大有助於彼等。余今已離開蘇聯，此種問話，余不顧作答。余於以往卅八年中曾爲余之生存而緘默，但余今縱欲言余心中欲言，亦屬無益，因塔斯社之消息足以歪曲其詞故也」。</p>

<h3>南韓政局腐敗　美官方表失望　南北韓爭執決提交聯大</h3>
<p>〔合社漢城七日電〕南北韓爭執將於本月提交巴黎之聯合國大會，但眞正之解決，勢非在美蘇撤軍之前所能獲得。自各種角度測量，南韓李承晚政府似根基不穩。南韓政府迄今尙無强有力之軍事機構，甚至其內部團結力亦有可疑之處。自南韓議會於五月三十一日於漢城開幕以來，當時氣氛二雖甚樂觀，但美國官員均失望於情形之腐敗。最令人失望者，爲李承晚之第一屆內閣。李氏曾研究世界各國之政府，但當本身選擇閣員時，不選取賢明能幹之官員，而僅償付政治宿債而已。閣員名單公佈後，均濫私人，且各政治團體又爭取武裝部隊之大權。如南韓準備者來之反共奮鬥，需經美國之最大努力，及南韓人士本身這更大助力。</p>
<h3>法新閣討論新經濟改革　許曼可望渡難關　共黨及右派議員均將提出議案</h3>

<h3>尼赫魯對議會正式宣布　海邦突進犯印象　印尼要求海邦制止恐怖行動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新德里七日電〕印度總理尼赫魯七日吿議會稱，印度及海德拉巴德兩軍，已在印度境內發生戰事。尼氏稱，政府六日接獲海邦軍隊進犯之報吿，來犯部隊係海邦之賴柴卡部隊。按賴柴卡爲回敎極端組織，支持海邦　主而反對海邦加入印度聯邦，尼氏稱，海軍以裝甲進攻，然被擊退，擊毁其一輛，並俘獲軍官一人，兵士八十五人。</p>

<h3>貝爾納斯呼籲　美蘇重開談判　「爲美蘇兩國利益打算，應該重新努力對德條約之一致。」</h3>
<p>〔合衆社西雅圖六日電〕美前國務卿貝爾納斯今日呼籲與蘇聯重開談判並爲雅爾達協定辯護稱，苟無此協定，蘇聯在中國與日本必獲得更多之地盤。貝氏呼籲西方國家，對德國問題與蘇聯车開談判稱，蘇聯縱有再侵略之可能，「我們亦不能因此打消和談之一切希望。」</p>
<p>雅爾達協定　中國事先同意</p>
<p>回顧在渠任內所發生之事件，貝氏稱，中國對於蘇聯在雅爾達所提要求早已完全同意。貝氏稱，惟當渠知悉莫洛托夫曾於一九四五年七月間，在莫斯科向中國提出更進一步之要求時，渠即向中國人民申明：「美國並不支持蘇聯在中國作更進一步之要求。」貝氏强調蘇聯，要求之是否合理，應以時期爲判断標準，當時若無雅爾達協定，蘇聯必将在中國取得更多地盤。渠指出雅爾達協定係在弛爾奇戰役。六星期後舉行，當時無人敢斷言大戰可於何日結束。再者，原子彈尙未發明，軍事領袖等估計进攻日本本土，需要一百萬兵员。渠稱，「若當時必須進攻日本，而如此繼續到六個月，蘇聯可能早已實際佔有雅爾达協定內協議讓與之所有土地。而如果沒有　爾達協定，蘇聯所佔之土地勢必更大。」貝氏提出問題數則，曰：若美國必須進攻日本，美國人民——尤其是爲父母者——是否願意蘇聯置身事外？美國是否能使蘇聯不千與任何事情？再者，若蘇聯加入戰爭，而同時又無協定同意麥克阿瑟爲最高統帥，我們是否將在日本遇到類似我們在歐洲所遇到的難題。</p>
<p>美蘇問題協定　實際並非屈服</p>
<p>貝氏爲以往美蘇間之協定辯護稱，「國人或以爲一切調解無非是屈服而已。此實爲危險之錯想。我們如願爲和平而努力，卽不該因懼怕代價高昂而毀滅和談之一切希望一。渠稱根據其個人之經驗，應付蘇聯確屬不易，但仍應努力。貝氏宣稱，蘇聯領袖，不致貿然參加戰爭，除非他們認爲可以戰勝我人。他們認爲作戰乃爲民族生存之必需手段。蘇聯領袖旣懼怕戰爭，大槪不致放過不經戰爭而可增加力量與地位之任何機會。今春之捷克事件，卽其明證。貝氏稱，爲「維持和平」計，美國之軍備計劃，應予保持，惟「最重要者，乃爲其他國家應認請美國並不欲控制任何國家。至於歐洲各國已經常苦於戰亂，當然不欲爲與蘇聯爭雄奪霸而使其國土變成戰塲」。「我們必須使他們相信，我們是他的爲保持自由而戰的盟友，我們不願將他們作抵押品，或作爲與蘇鬥爭的衛星國」。</p>
<p>蘇聯的人民　亦不願有戰爭</p>
<p>貝氏稱，「某些人說，由於蘇聯之態度，已使我們明白我們不能建設一個世界，我們必須建設兩個世界，這種悲觀的看法，也有其部份的理由，但是我不放棄希望。這以前，我們也曾見過政府改變其政策。鐵幕之後究竟是什麽我們不得而知，但是東歐國家却因此感覺不安。我們能够斷定，蘇聯人民與美國人民一驟絕不願意有戰爭。所以我們希望蘇聯人民對於和平及改善其生活水準之熱望，能影響蘇聯之領袖們改變他們的政策」。「爲美蘇兩國之利益打算，我們應該重新努力於對德條約之一致。若使德國成爲一抵押品，或成爲東西爭雄的助手，都與美國或蘇聯無利」。貝氏結束其演講稱，「祗要人們肯聚在一起討論問題，卽使言詞上稍有不敬，終究會有協議希望的。但如果有人停止談判，其他談判者最好就得準備戰爭」。</p>
<p>解除德武裝　各國軍隊撤退</p>
<p>貝氏之呼籲緊接四外長或將於秋季重開談判希望而發。貝氏擬就下列數點，作爲協議之參考：</p>
<p>第一，「德國……應被解除武裝，並至少繼續一代。此事與美蘇兩國有極大利益。」第二，當合適之德國政府成立後四佔領國之軍隊應立卽全部撤退。餘下少數保安部隊監視德國解除武裝。」氏承認雙方都彼此不能信任，但渠稱，「因此更需要有一條約……德國在四十年內解除武裝。」二年以前，貝氏本人曾向蘇聯提出是項建議。提及國際共管魯爾區可能引起爭執一事，貝氏稱，魯爾之管理「可能交德國近鄰手中。」至於賠償及其他爭執事宜，貝氏稱，「蘇聯不應在波茨坦協定之外，再有更多之獲得。」</p>

<h3>陳立夫出席茶會　接受各界歡迎　報告此次出國觀感　盛讚英美民主精神</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本巿各界昨日於午後三時假麗都花園茶會歡迎甫自海外歸來之陳副院長立夫伉儷。吳國禎·潘公展·宣鐵吾·方治·陶希聖·吳開先·趙祖康·李熙謀·倪弼·徐學禹·杜月笙·徐寄廢等均出席。陳副院長於軍樂聲中蒞臨，夫人則因足疾未至。主席吳市長致歡迎辭，盛譽陳氏在民主及共產兩種思想之鬥爭中，爲一先知覺，其目光最爲遠大，故當年堅主防共亦爲最力。陳氏隨卽於全體鼓掌歡迎聲中起立演說，簡述道德重整會議舉行之經過。謂此會已有十年之歷史，主持人波克曼博士曾游歷中國，與國父中山先生晤談，對我國素有感情。而其服膺之理論，亦與我國之哲學相近似。道德重整會議之起源，爲英國牛津地方少數人士，深感唯物主義之威脅，民主主義無理論堪與對抗，故有本會之發起。成立以後，在北歐發生之影響最大，在英國南咸爾斯一帶亦有相當力量，近年來傳至美國後，以彼邦人士深感物質文明之發展逐漸减少人類博愛，未來之危機堪處，故樂於接受，發展甚速。道德重整運動有四項標準，卽爲：誠實·純潔·無私·博愛·力主民主政治應以道德爲基礎，其最終目標爲世界和平。此次開會時，參加者大多數均到過中國，故對華多具好感。至於此運動在華如何開展，本人此時尙未想到，事實上中國自古有此美德，今日是知而未行。</p>
<p>個人自由　絕對尊重</p>
<p>陳氏繼暢論美國民主政治，謂曾親身被邀參加民主共和兩黨之費城大會，深感其特點所在，爲絕對尊重個人自由，但至緊要關頭，能爲黨而團結，不使發生裂痕，政治上用人用錢，完全公開。城巿參議會開會時，人民均可旁聽，如得半數以上之同意通過，且可發言。太人深惑民主政治之最大優點，在使執政者能常與人民接觸，其言行須代表人民之真正利益，其結果爲政治之淸明有效。我國行憲伊始，當誠心正意，師法他國之長處，同時民主政治之完成，尙須有忍耐之美德。</p>
<p>頌揚英國　刻苦精神</p>
<p>陳氏對英國之刻苦及守法精神，頌揚備至，謂工黨之政策，與國父之政策頗爲相似。英國戰時損失慘重，以往屋一項而論，爲飛彈所毀者，即在二百萬幢以上，但其重建工作之迅速，亦出人意表“統制配給成績尤爲優良，國內貧富生活一致，品質最佳之貨物均用以出口，爭取外匯。以英美中三國之物質生活相比較，美國是「天賦特厚，什麽都有；英國爲在生活必需品之外，大家都沒有；我國則爲有的太有，沒有的太沒有。」英人特別注重守法，人民知識程度又高，故政令之推行，毫不發生困難，英倫行銀之總裁向本人表示：任何經濟方案之推行，與各同業公會負責人會商停當後，卽推行無阻，政府所賦予之大權，竟可保留不用。英國政治效率之高，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>共同努力　方克有濟</p>
<p>最後練副院長論及我國局勢，幣制政革決非全部經濟問題解決之謂，目前局勢仍極嚴重，必須上下一心，方可渡過難關，本人認爲政治及經濟背後，必須尙有道德力量，每個人自本身做起，且須多數人共同努力，方克有濟。陳氏演說在兩小時以上，語意精警，態度誠懇，聞者均爲之動容，歡迎會至五時三刻始吿結束。</p>

<h3>高坑煤礦</h3>
<p>— 本報記者劉藻</p>
<p>這次浙贛鐵路樟樹株州段通車，得到路局南昌辦事露王元康副局長與南春段工程處處長鄰岳生二兄的協助，廣翰西煤綴局協理陳邦樞的努力，本報記者得以迅速的西去，現階段江南唯一大煤礦——高坑。茲將觀察所得，詳誌於後：</p>
<p>〔本報南昌四日航訊〕萍煤的歷史，遠在四十年前，於前淸光緒廿四年三月由張之洞會同盛宣懷奏准淸廷，那時煤礦的總辦，是張贊宸，開採的地區，在萍鄉縣屬距縣城約四公里安源。當年的第一次總產量是一萬噸，第一次歐戰爆發後民國五年的產量達九十五瓦噸，達過去四十年來產煤的最高峯。根據江西地質調查所的報吿，萍煤的產區有安源區，高坑區。安源區是本區</p>
<p>萍鑛主體</p>
<p>其範圍自安源起，東北經八仙冲，到王家源，繞紫家沖，天子山而南，經小坑雙鳳冲，沿南路河到五陂下，再由五陂下循大路到安源。此一地區的煤儲量，輕過去四十年的開採，所存無幾，所以現在贛西煤礦局，收開採的重點，轉向高坑。</p>
<p>高坑區處於安源的東南，其範圍自八仙冲東行，經王家源，更東北行經龍家冲，高坑而達高崗埠，由高崗埠西行，經亂石嶺，轉西南經雲居埠，茶亨里，九里坪，而達安源。</p>
<p>萍鄕產煤地層的時代，經迭次地質學者的調查，斷定係屬中生代下侏羅紀。據一般調查的結果：</p>
<p>（二）二疊紀，（二）三疊紀，（三）侏羅紀，（四）第三紀，（五）第四紀。</p>
<p>萍煤區域內的</p>
<p>地質構造</p>
<p>極爲複雜，它與煤層關係最密切者，似爲白票耙的造山運動。所以萍煤的主要地質構造爲扭轉斷層，此斷層走向，大致爲東東北——西南，延長約五公里，昔日萍礦開盤總平巷時，盤至上述接界處，値岩層斷裂，曾一度崩陷，幾經周折，始得穿透，是亦足爲斷裂層存在的旁證。</p>
<p>本區的煤系，計有煤十餘層，其主要者爲蓬　，與大礦兩層，相距甚近，其間接之頁岩或不及半公尺，亦有相隔二公尺許者，兩層煤的厚度變化甚大，平均約在四公尺左右，在高坑厚約四公尺在小坑到黃坑厚薄不定，其次要煤層，計有一夾　，三夾礦，硯子礦，硬子礦，蔴姑礦及掃邊礦等曆。</p>
<p>據煤礦局的調查，高坑區可採的煤曆與厚度如次：</p>
<p>高坑可採煤層厚度表</p>
<p>區分煤層厚度</p>
<p>高坑硯子礦　一至一·六公尺</p>
<p>硬子礦　〇至一·三公尺</p>
<p>蓬礦　〇·二至一·四公尺</p>
<p>大礦　二至四·五公尺</p>
<p>蔴姑礦　〇·二至二·三公尺</p>
<p>萍煤的煤質甚佳，惟近年來土井礦商不顧信譽，滲拌石碴，黑土，以致煤譽一落千丈。現在，贛西煤礦局正在力謀改善，恢復過去的信譽。據悉：現在的萍煤，所含灰份不多，含硫成分亦僅千分之五，可供煉焦之用，蔴姑礦及一夾礦煤質較堅硬，故煤塊較多，在紫家冲一帶塊煤佔百分之四十六，大礦煤較鬆脆，塊煤約佔百分之十。</p>
<p>根據贛西煤礦局本年一月十日委托漢口商品檢驗局代爲化驗高坑煤的</p>
<p>化學分析</p>
<p>如下表：</p>
<p>煤層　水份　輝發炭　炭粉　硫　BTV念懷軍</p>
<p>一分井混合煤　二、四四　二三、一八　五四、〇四　二〇、三四　一、二七　一二〇六五</p>
<p>三分井混合煤　二、一九　二三、四四　五八、六〇　一五、七七　〇、八　一二八六八</p>
<p>四分井混合煤　二、二九　二一、九五　五五、九四　一八、八二　〇、三　一二二〇七</p>
<p>萍礦煤藏量，根據一九三七年江西地質調查所的報吿：安源區餘存的煤量（紫家冲至小坑，及安源至黃坑一帶）爲八，六〇〇，〇〇〇噸，高坑區（高坑至王家源一帶）一九三三年朱謙等的調查報吿爲三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇至四〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公噸。最近煤礦局根據地質調查及鑽眼記錄，估計高坑區的儲量共約六三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇萬噸，惟以高坑區的地質變化情形複雜，而鑽探工作未克完備，所以高崗埠附近的煤藏，難以估計，苟有充足探鑛設備，繼續鑽探，則高崗埠附近，如有延長的煤田，則總儲量當不止此。根據目前所估計的藏量，假定採煤效率，爲百分之八十，則產煤量應爲五千餘萬噸，如以年產一百五十萬噸計，則高坑區的煤藏，可供三十餘年的開採。</p>
<p>高坑採煤</p>
<p>目前尙未全部使用機械，究全應千五百多礦工的手臂，將礦床底層的煤掘出來。每日的產量，約在三百噸左右。但是萍鑛區內的私人土井每日的產量，亦不能小視。卽以用來由礦地推遲煤炭爲生的手推小車而論，每日行使在煤道而進城的，多的時候，將近有二萬輛，他們所推的煤，就完全是私人的土非所掘出來的。</p>
<h3>崇明苞米大量出境</h3>

<h3>著名女高音聲樂家　管喻宜萓在西北</h3>
<p>— 本報記者炳林</p>
<p>〔本報迪化五日航訊〕國內著名的女高音聲樂家管失人喻宜　女士，前應西北文化建設協會理事長張文白將軍之邀，於七月十七日飛臨迪化，舉行獨唱會三次，廿四日在蘇聯領館舉行獨唱會時，和平廣塲特別裝　了播音器四具，使數萬素性愛好歌舞的各族同胞，有一個暢聽的機會。而蘇領館吳副領事對管夫人藝術造詣之深，亦備加讀揚。副領事夫人也代表全館蘇聯駐迪人負百餘人，親向管夫人獻鮮花致敬。待管夫人三次獨唱會結束後，卽漫遊其素所響往之天池，一住四日，廿九日午後始自天池歸來。</p>
<p>新疆音樂　天賦極高</p>
<p>年前曾赴京滬表演新疆歌舞的靑年歌舞團，復於那天深夜特爲管夫人表演邊疆民族的歌舞，至深夜二時許始散，記者請她發表對於邊疆歌舞之意見時，她很興奮的說：「新疆的音樂極暢快而且頗合節奏，歌唱的天賦也極高，可惜未能以現代的科學方法發音，練唱。但此稱民族音樂，大可向中原各地傳播發揚，以激發各民族團結與歡暢的情緒。…………」</p>
<p>劉秘書長　贈詩一首</p>
<p>她在新疆搜集，了許多首民歌，均請西北長官公署翻譯室何主任譯成漢文。長官公署劉秘書長孟純在管夫人上搬東飛之時，撰跚「天池紀遊」詩一首：「渾雄氣脈從西流，天山之巔常白頭，千峯融作萬頃柔，　　蒼波綠玉浮，，森古松靑入畔，揭來策馬最高丘，天風吹歌雲爲收，翠山俯首聆淸　，柏水　裳作龍遊，　態　與仙人　，此境可遇不可求，惜哉未能十日留，長空皓月意悠悠！」</p>
<p>管夫人東飛途經屬州時，曾與張文白將軍談起舞設新綴藝術學校的事，她更希望能在國外介紹新疆的民歌。</p>
<p>維族之花　接獲一函</p>
<p>最近，管喻宜萱有一對自武漢寄來的信給康巴爾罕女士。茲將該函探誌於後：</p>
<p>「康巴爾罕女士：此次西北之行，得　與女士相見，愉快之餘，尤覺不勝榮幸。在迪化時，承你和你的先生數度駕臨寄宿處，惑何如之！復承以貴團歌舞殷殷招待，這種珍貴的友誼，我當永遠珍責着。我特地向你和你的先生及全體貴團團員致謝！</p>
<p>「錯途中曾在閩州逗留三日，張主任（按即指張文白將軍）對賢优　等頗表關懷，曾詳詢一切，關於籌設藝術學校事，己與張主任提及，他早有此意，只是經費問題而己。極盼你這種計劃，能早日實現！新張歌舞如能得着正式的學校訓練，無疑義的，更可發揚光大。我喜愛它那種生氣充沛，愉快熱烈的情緒，如能使它普遍發展，對於整個中國的民族說來，確是一劑寶貴的仙丹。我希望當局不斷的倡導，更希望你不斷來領導新疆歌舞，步入一條光明的大道！</p>
<p>先去平台再赴法國</p>
<p>在本年春天，我僥倖得着聯合國文敎組織的一個獎學金，擬於不久後赴歐洲考察，並觀察西洋各國的音樂藝術，頃得巴黎的來電，約我在九月間去法國，但我想於去國前，先去北平台灣各地舉行音樂會，因此恐來不及按時出國，我還想多搜集一些各地的民歌，以便在國外介紹純中國性的歌曲。在迪化時，曾數次託人收集新疆民歌，據賣團某團員說，曾以歌譜數種交行　何光奎先生轉交本人，但一直未見轉到，頗以爲憾。今特懇你代爲設法，賜寄新疆民歌數曲，如能將歌詞翻譯漢文，尤爲歡迎。麻煩得很，先此道謝！</p>
<p>「武漢天氣悶熱不己，更使我懷念迪化的凉爽，和那些甜美的瓜菓，尤其那些富於情感而友善的人們！更有那天山的雪和瑤池（按：即天池）裏的水，那一切的一切，都令人永誌難忘！以後如有機會，我願意再來拜訪你們！……管喻宜萱敬上。」</p>
<h3>風火島　香港二三事</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港四日航訊〕老香港的人說：舊歷八月初一的前前後後，颱風常來襲擊香港，假如初一那天恰好于有風訊，那麽，這塲颱風倒是「不同凡凡」的。今年九月三日那天明明是舊歷八月初一，美國氣象員給牠起名「葛特魯」的颱風正由菲律賓浩浩蕩蕩的向香港衝過來，風勢雖不十分猛烈，可是港九兩岸間的交通爲此停頓了一個早晨和半個下午，人們還是竊竊慶幸，這回總算沒有釀成了什麽災難。然而災難和八月初一的颭風對香港似乎結成一個歷史的不解緣，不過這回的災難沒有直接發生在一般居民的眼前吧了</p>
<p>一列快車肇成慘劇</p>
<p>在香港三十多哩外的一個山坡間，當天下午，由廣州開來的一列快車，就給狂風一陣吹倒。火車出軌，在戰後的鐵路上，幾乎已失去了牠的新聞性，但受傷的乘客深夜一批一批運抵九龍，而刧後餘生的也痛述失事的慘劇，第四個車廂撞碎了第三個車廂，又把她翻落兩丈高的路基外，據最保守的估計：死傷人數至少二百以上，這當非尋常的撞車可比了。記者執筆的現在，路局還在趕辦善後工作恢復通車，遙遙無期。這塲巨災，在颱風之外，是否另有奸匪事前拔去路釘，蓄意破壞省港間的交通大動脈，現巳由有關方面切實調查中。</p>
<h3>藏民殘喘</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記　徐仁常</p>
<p>〔本報雅安二日航訊〕康藏人的宗敎生活，其精神寄託在聖地與活佛二者上面的，但在政治生活上，就與此恰恰相反了。康藏兩地，高寒磽瘡，物產無多，人民終年勞苦，尙不容易求得一飽，如果政府和官吏不苛虐他們，他們還可勉强維持，如要橫征暴歛，他們便滬挨冷受餓了。</p>
<p>生殺予奪</p>
<p>拉薩政府的政敎勢力，至今還一直達到金沙江西岸，其中包括着對於西康管轄着十幾個縣份，宗敎勢力，對於西藏本地和金沙江東岸各縣，派出了無數僧俗官吏做他們的爪牙，實施嚴格的政敎管制。對於金沙江的東岸附屬各縣，又派出無數高級喇嘛，常川駐在各個寺廟裏面，做各該寺的最高統治人。西藏律令，只有原則上的十幾個規定，並無詳明條文，在統治工作上，官更的一時喜怒是法律，調理民間事務，是不必有條文根據的，所以這一批僧俗官更對於管轄區內的人民具有無上權咸，生殺予奪絕對自由，他們不僅代表政府征收賦稅，還要自由增加賦額，飽入私囊，他們日常生活所需，一概取之於人民，細微至於柴草茶水，繁苛至於性的需求，都要勅令人民供給。除他們和他們的家人奴僕實際銷耗外，還要設爲種稱名目，折收現金，運回家鄕存儲。凡過人民糾紛，要官方解決公開索賄不用說了，就連求見一面，也事先取够，叩頭銀子假使賄賂不及對方優厚時，那麽，或者是當堂打死，或者是宰手挖目，或是分屍飼犬火水焚淹，那就要看當時官吏的喜怒而定，都沒有一定的準則，最輕的，不致慘死，但是財產總是保不住。至於駐在金沙江東岸各縣寺廟裏面的喇嘛，其權力雖沒有西岸各地僧俗官吏之大，但靠山吃山，他們的生活仍然是取之於當地人民，不過所用的榨取方式，比較上略有不同罷了。</p>
<p>反抗方式</p>
<p>康藏人民生活本來艱苦，很難以自給自足，再加上官吏和剌嘛們的無饜掠奪，更是無法喘息，怨仇塊在心坎深處，始終不敢作積極反抗的表現，在這種深懷仇恨間又不敢積極反抗的局面之下，便自然而然的發生了兩個消極反抗方式：</p>
<p>第一，他們　請菩薩呌他們早死，以便脫黎現實的痛苦，生入另外一個所想的西方凈土裏面去。</p>
<p>第二，如果碰到可能機會，他們便會離家潛逃，走入漢官管轄的區域裏面來，另找安身立命之地。能否早死是不能由人力自作安排的，於是，第二個辦法便爲他們隨時可用了，可是藏官的刑罰是非常嚴虐的，貪心又特別重，因爲他們也要隨時拿錢去供奉上級長官，假使在中途把他們追趕回去了，那便休想活命，財產也會無有保存，即令是己逃到漢官區域來了，也會想盡種種方法把他們捕捉回去，同樣的會陷入家敗人亡之慘境。他們有一個口頭蟬，說是：「頂好的藏官不及頂壤的漢官」。</p>
<p>防止內向</p>
<p>過去，西藏有一個哲學，曾作一個預言啓示人民說：「將來我們的救主，是來自東方的「。這句話緊緊的記在他們人民的腦筋裏面，天天都在盼望着這東方的救主早日降臨，現正在事實上又確切見到漢藏政府及其所派官吏之各別作風，更加證實了這個預言的價値，堅定他們的內向心理，他們很歡迎漢官，以能一覩漢官威儀爲快。但是，藏官和喇嘛們深知這種情形，對自己相當危險，他們隨時故意還作種穢蜚語來攻擊漢官，以防止人民對於內地的傾慕。</p>
<p>今古奇觀　版權所有</p>
<p>九月在香港，新聞特別多，記者節那天，半數以上同業不特睡少了一覺，甚至坐下來喝杯慶祝「自己的節日」的酒的空閒也沒有。</p>
<h3>十一個私梟好大膽</h3>
<p>一日上午二時許，香港海關方面便興高彩烈給各報通電話，說是緝獲一批價値百餘萬元的私貨，還有一艘最新式的走私船。記者聞訊爬起牀來，帶着惺忪的睡眼，跑到海關前面的石碼頭去。據關員說：那十一個私梟好大膽，他們在香港背後僻靜的海面裝好了私貨，還要到附近的魚鮮酒家買醉一杯，正當他們酒酣耳熱之中，海關人員飛羿過去，把裝滿私貨的武裝小輪拖走，幷派大隊警察在附近海岸圍捕那些私梟，結果，他們都一一落綱，這是緝私戰中一塲光輝的勝利。記者陪了海關人負的高興，回來寫好了稿，天色已大白了、</p>
<h3>香港人「談火色變」</h3>
<p>一日的傍晚，記者們正坐下來乾杯，忽見一鼓黑烟自海傍陡起，消防局員報吿，海軍船塢失火了。「公而忘私」，若干人便放下酒杯，向目的地衝去，原來火燒的祗是海軍船塢的一角，火神光臨了裝滿醫藥用品的一個堆棧，損失的藥品，共値八十萬元，其中竟貯有大批「如意袋」！</p>
<p>這十天來，香港人對於火，頗有「談虎色變」之勢，上月廿三日對岸九龍倉的三百桶哥士的蘇打惹起了四小時的大火，把推滿在二萬四千方尺面積　價値七八百萬元的貨物，（以洋紙和化學原料佔爲大宗）燒個精光，有幾個戰後暴發戶也因這塲大火而「還原」。人們「隔岸觀火」，火舌飛騰數十丈，怵目驚心，至難忘却。</p>
<h3>破壞金融自食惡果</h3>
<p>老天好像故意和新聞記者大開其玩笑，一日那天還有一件轟動全港的新聞，在港中金融界素有相當聲譽的永誠銀號，因炒金失敗，關門大吉。據說牠的主人何某對國內通貨向來不具信任，當金圓劵發行前夕，國內金融大起波動之中，他一手購進期金五萬兩，當日每兩市價由三二〇元驟升至三三〇元以上，何氏平空獲利五十多萬元，極爲得意，不料金圓券發行後，金價暴跌每兩前後相差五十多元何某眼看金價跌至三〇風元時，還堅持對國內通貨的　視，不肯拋出，迨金價「遝魂乏術」，而何某便身敗名裂，關上大門，溜之大吉·何某是役約損失二百萬元，這是一個故意破壞金融而自食其果的最新例子。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕上海區物資調節委員會主要調節物資，包括下列五項：（一）食油，（二）食糧，（三）花紗布，（四）食糖，（五）燃料。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕又據該會某負責人稱：首批美援棉花，最近卽可報關，預計可易紗六萬件，內外銷各半分配。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕糖市昨因合糖公司又配粗砂，人心稍軟，特配粗砂棧單跌至二八元六角五分，現貨亦小至二九元二角，車白精麻袋裝，依限略有成交，靑糖照限開出四十包，派予往來字號。</p>
<h3>申新等廠在市拋售　棉紗供源量盛　布疋交易熱門行情再挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因中紡申新等各廠在市開售，供源驟轉充裕，在限度下，本客兩帮吸力頗强，交易之熱鬧，爲「八一九」來所未見。惟以龍頭細布跌進限盤，新買戶不多，塲內複製業用紗，均向紗廠直接申購，故細紗做開甚少。紡建公司續開廿支荷心。紅蜂。鐘星·紅魁星等四種，價均爲七百零七元，成交各牌粗細紗共計二百卅五件，比上日多一百零九件。</p>
<p>又訊；中紡公司開售十支金寶星卅件，價爲六百元，申新紗廠向市塲大量開售，其辦法委由紗商公會辦理。前日應開紗二五〇件，參加申請者一二五家，共請購一六九件。今日應配出二二二件，加以前日剩餘之八一件，今日所可配出者，總計三〇三件。</p>
<p>又訊：中紡業務處，曾於上月十九日公吿，几借該公司管筒之谷客戶，應於規定時間內繳淸，否則逾期暫停配紗。現規定期限已過，而公布之客戶，尙有多家未繳者。頃該公司再度公吿，自今日起，朱繳清者暫停配給，此中客戶屬於十二廠者五家，屬於十七廠者四家，屬於第二廠者十家。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市情，自該業公會董理事長倡導拋售後，繼起者踵接，塲內交易益形熱鬧，多頭均主了結，同業吐售亦多，北帮如同源湧等，亦來轉賣，供應趨暢，市勢頓呈平疲。購戶都係門莊號家，信大祥·協大祥等，乘機吸納，以應市銷。龍頭細布以廿九元四角開出後，永信公司再來拋售，致龍頭細布行情亦再挫一角，爲廿九元三角，均有成交。其他五福·喇叭童·陽鶴·細布，咸在限價下做開甚夥。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司循例開配五福B細布，桃園圖細布，玩傘漂布，元嗶嘰及被單等十四種，申購者以五福B細布較多。</p>
<p>中紡棉紗　運瀋拋售</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽七”電〕中紡東北分公司，昨由錦州空運二百件棉紗來瀋，以後將陸續運來一千六百件，一部卽向市塲拋售，以穩定紗價，又中紡錦州分廠，現有紡紗機六萬錠，因電力原料不足，僅開一萬錠日產棉紗十五件。</p>
<h3>銀根平穩　穗廈匯水再提高</h3>
<p>昨日銀根，勢仍呈現平穩，游資南流仍夥，市間需單較殷，但以市塲交易續少做開，工商業多單，絕少去處，暗息回落一角左右。業內行莊，雖國家行局連日差進，但以存款有增未己，毫無俏象存在云。又訊：游資南流，日來更見汹湧，本市商業行莊，對於穗·廈兩地匯水，再度提高，每千元約收八十元以上。而五十圓面額之金圓券，己於昨起發行，航帮又在搜掉，以之携運南往，藉以逃避當局注意，並謀節省匯水。</p>
<p>政府鑒於游資南逃，又見加劇，決定恢復限制匯款辦法，又關於國內金圓券之准許自由携運數量，刻在財部斟酌核訂中，公佈有待。</p>
<h3>外銷茶穩俏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據茶葉出口權威人士吿記者：自我國政府將幣制改革後，對於出口物資，由輸管會公佈F.O.B（上海船上交貨）最低限價，因此目前一般出口物資，在國際市塲漸見抬頭，輸出商咸表欣慰，而尤以茶業更趨佳境。惜各貨以產存涸枯，及產價陡增，致運日洋莊茶市，交易甚稀，潛勢則頗穩俏。至於內銷花色各有進出，過程無大波動。</p>
<p>又悉：本年度祁門紅茶，刻由安徽茶葉公司思續到一批，共計三一四箱，聞卽擬佈售貨樣云。</p>
<h3>呢羢喊價混亂</h3>
<p>最近數日來，呢羢行情突轉顛倒，表面上雖零躉並價，門市只有少數應酬，批發生意减做，然事實上，茶會批發價高於零星售價，廠方開價又高於市場所喊價格，中紡開價則始終照限不動，故塲外亦未能越級升漲。惟花呢嗶嘰大衣呢應時各貨，多不能開得，致喊價混亂。以前中紡呢羢可以開得時，塲內外售價相差祗有五角上落，目下因未能獲得，其相差額己上落二三元不等。</p>
<p>洋紙運滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕天祥洋行經理之巴拿馬輪阿克套號，此次由蘇聯庫頁島薩克哈立埠，運來紙顧六四一七件，前日傍晚抵滬，現泊太古公司華通碼頭起卸。</p>
<p>四千噸豆餅　運廣州廈門</p>
<p>國營招商局「漢民輸」，自滬裝糖。豆餅。白　等物資二千二百噸，定今晨運往廣州供應，「其美輪」自滬裝豆餅及麩皮等二千二百噸，定明（九）日運往厦門應需云。</p>
<h3>天雨交易清淡　食米賡續回挫　汕市趨勢盤旋交易稀少</h3>
<p>米市平疲，天下豪雨，市上行人稀疏，致交易亦甚淸淡。米店因戶口米已發售，故上市添購者頗少，去路不活。晨開價格與上日相同，後市因銷路不佳，故見下疲，惟大都價格仍站上日原價，秈米略見挫落四五角，高貨糙秈米連袋十六元，嘉興新糙秈十五元五角，較上日降五角之讀。昨日到貨南市塲二二五九石，北市一九一二石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>轉趨堅昂，昨日各粉價格略見加砌，因棧單出貨期已滿，售戶已少，加之廠方連日無貨開出，市勢由此轉堅，惟交易甚少，實銷納胃不多。兵船粉祗開七元二角四分一價，較上日升一角一分，老車粉略挺五分，至遲才有開出，紅蜂漲五分，建成挺九分，其他雜牌粉均見稍升。麩皮仍站限價。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市勢平穩，交易漸多。黃豆油廠納取，車豆，乍豆，開出頗多，價仍站限價。苞米北帮納胃如常，供求均多，市亦平定。紅糧挺二角，客帮有去路，蠶豆平平，　豆存貨稀少，未有開出。元麥與上日彷彿，惟交易殊少。芝蔴依限價開出，生仁內地有去化，大汶口生仁三十三元，開出尙多。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>市勢盤旋，昨日交易甚爲平淡，價格幾無上落。豆油大統廠等亦有開出，價爲四十九元七角，現貨一律在五十元之內。同豐豆油爲四十九元，市稱平定，生油價格仍站限度。凈生油開四五十桶，價五九·九〇元。吉桶小車無交易，舊桶小車蔴油按五十二元五角限價開出，生菜油獨見提升五角，開四十六元。豆餅客銷靜寂，廠方開價，大多四元六角，　籠貨低二分。</p>
<h3>木材限價核定</h3>
<p>木材限價，經公會正式基准主管機關核定，昨起將限價表分發同業，遵照限價交易。關於核定限價，計洋松不分方片，每尺均爲五角七分，杉木小條一角二分三厘，松片一角二分七厘，餘則多與前數日開價相仿。僅松板鋸方每丈四元三角三分，及坦戶板二元五角，均係普通貨。而紅星與雙錢兩牌子貨，限價較高，則爲五元與二元六角七分。又昨杉木大條照限價一角三分。</p>
<h3>烟皂市氣衰退</h3>
<p>捲烟有大東南·華美·華明等各廠商對大小同行，全滬普遍派貨，同時永泰和通知本埠甲·乙·丙·同行大量派貨，故業內銀根漸緊，各烟均照限賣出者甚多</p>
<p>肥皂中國祥茂公司亦有巨量派出，同業聞訊後，散戶紛起拋售，各皂均再跌入限度。計固本皂二六元五角，祥茂皂二〇元零三角，均有賣出。</p>
<h3>無錫秋繭產稀價昂</h3>
<p>本年無錫秋繭爲數極微，蠶農索價以十八石米換乾繭一擔，照該地米價每石十八元，每擔乾繭需金圓三百廿四元。</p>
<h3>解決京滬區煤荒　燃管會籌增煤源　預計每月可增爲念七萬噸</h3>
<p>燃料管理委員會，爲配合經濟緊急處分令，對於京滬區燃煤之供給，特擬具計劃，其中最重要者，爲如何增加煤源，己擬定六項措施：</p>
<p>（一）協助條複北寗路唐榆段雙軌，（二）籌備塘沽新港轉運灤煤（三）鼓勵台煤外銷，（四）津浦路運輸力之增强，（五）解決煤輪之困難，（六）獎勵廠商自運烟煤。</p>
<p>以上各項措施，預計可增加煤源，每月爲二十七萬噸。內華東及淮南兩礦共十萬噸，合灣五萬噸，開灤十二萬噸，每月京滬區以二十二萬噸分配，尙存煤五萬噸。目前燃煤，自有困難，但不久即可克服。又該會即將結束，新機構正籌備組設中，己定名爲烟煤調節供應處專負京滬區燃煤之供應事宜。</p>
<p>又訊：外煤（白煤）將又有一船進口，該輪爲中國航運公司之「凌雲輪」，係自越南鴻基裝白煤七千四百五十二噸，定本月十三日運祗滬供應，九月份本市所需配售之煤球數量，將更充足無虞云。又台安輪及大生輪，自秦皇島裝灘煤一萬一千噸，將於三日祗滬云。</p>

<h3>美軍棒球聯賽　中華一落千丈　女子壘球賽　蘭燈退列亞軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國人染　跑　廳棒壨球寶之望，已隨中華之健將壨散，及蘭燈之一再敗北而歸還滅。中華諸老將，泰半倦勤，轉由熊貓新血遞補，球藝經驗，俱未免遜色，故在第二屆美海軍棒球聯賽中，屢戰屢北，已無第一屆時予錦標隊空軍以嚴重咸脅之實力。第二屆聯饗，已入第二循環，空軍挾上屆霸主威名，以八戰七勝雄踞首席。海侖娜四勝二負，居第二。業餘五勝三負列第三。中華六出祁山，纔一獲勝，殿第七位。現暑期已過，各校開課在即，熊貓健兒，多靑年學子，此後更難望專心此道，黃包裏一席，當不易掙脫。茲將二屆棒聯最近形勢列下：</p>
<p>隊名　賽　勝　負　百分比</p>
<p>空軍　八　七　一　·八五七</p>
<p>海侖鄒　六　四　二　·六六七</p>
<p>業餘　八　五　三　·六二五</p>
<p>南京　十二　六　六　·五〇〇</p>
<p>陸軍　十　五　五　·五〇〇</p>
<p>海軍　十　二　八　·二〇〇</p>
<p>中華　六　一　五　·一六七</p>
<p>國際體育會主辦之女子壘球聯賽，蘭燈第一循環不幸以一分被敎聯擊敗後，又因一念輕敵，慘遭浣熊吞噬，將第二循環報仇雪恨，與敎聯平分錦標之希望，亦一併斷送。由是士氣頹喪，再會敎聯時，竟至潰不成軍。現敎聯已以連捷十六役之偉績，榮登后座。蘭燈則尙餘補賽數塲，亞軍一席，當不致再發生間題。又國際體育會爲慶祝各項球賽之完滿結束起見，特排定閉幕表演賽數塲，由「太太」，「小姐」，「學生」三隊，參加角逐，本星期日下午四時，由「小姐」與「學生」對壘。</p>
<h3>公開綱球　今明停賽</h3>
<p>星期五起續賽</p>
<p>秋雨不止，公開網球賽又遭雨阻，致比賽不能順序進行，對辦事及競賽精神，諸多影響。且大雨之後，塲面紅粉·黃沙，被水冲洗，須加整理·網球委員會辦事處稱：今明兩日，無論晴雨，決計停賽，如　卽日放晴，則自星期五（十日）起續賽，秩序重排發表。</p>
<p>據辦事處負責人稱：公開賽開始之一星期，氣候晴暖，進行順利，此後卽迭遇連綿豪雨，致未能照預定計話成。網球委員會鑒於靑年網球會之落成，建立比較完美之球塲，爲使本市網球界提高興趣，期收普及進步之效果，特將公開賽全部比賽，假該會球塲舉行，委員會並不惜犧牲，供給全部比賽用球，當公開賽開始報名時之經費預算，爲法幣五十億元，但自八月十九日幣制改革時之估計，則需七十五億，合金圓劵二千五百元，此由於八月上半月份指數激增之故。委員會顯已遭遇重大困難，但決當努力克服之。</p>

<h3>英秀堂鬥蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>今日爲白霧節，一年一度的鬥蟋蟀時期又到了。江浙兩省人士喜玩秋虫者，視爲大事，餉養者有專家，執草者有名手，白露節後，開始秋興（賭鬥名詞），京滬滬杭兩路名鎭市，分期舉行，最後之勝利者，稱爲無敵大將軍。余友人中有喜此道者，余偶一觀賞其虫，但未參觀其鬥。</p>
<p>民前余在故都讀書時，曾與余兄及友人到英秀堂參與鬥蟋蟀之會。英秀堂者，在故都前門外大外廊營一號，爲戲界大王譚鑫培之住宅。余等數人本爲痰（譚）迷，老譚又爲湖北人，以同鄉而兼同嗜，故每年秋季常參觀其虫會。英秀堂鬥蟋蟀之日，携虫來者，有貴族，有官僚，有商人，有生，且，凈，丑各戲角。雨虫相配，必須銖兩悉稱，始得入柵，司此職者，爲一老公（即太監），以銀樓所用之戰，一一衡其分量，必極平無稍參差，然後分對開門。鑫培常至兩虫下盆時，始自內宅徐出觀之。</p>
<p>一日鑫培得一「廣翼」（蟋蟀之一種），喜與余等觀之。當日故都售蟋蟀之地，在順治門（即宣武門）外各店，以二兩銀可買得蟋蟀一小簍，約有數十頭，其中亦常有至佳者。余史、兄在萬順老店買一簍歸，細挑選之，其中有一「廣翼」，頭大足長，似爲英物。即與鑫培商只選一日試鬥，不約多人，至期到者，除英秀堂家人外，僅余兄弟友人共約十餘人。老公秤兩「廣翼」之分量，譚虫重於余兄所有者，約一釐弱，魏培問如何？余兄本不門花，（花者，即鬥虫時兩邊所下之賭注名稱。）不過藉虫之鬥爭，以博一笑，故乙虫之重量，雖稍輕於譚虫，仍願下盆，以觀其究竟。開機後，執草者略一引動，兩虫之長鬚相觸，立即奮然前撲，兩牙相咬，肉搏翻騰，狀至慘烈，余兄之虫忽改變戰略，咬其敵之腿，鑫培旁觀注視，大呼：「咬了我的大腿了。」觀者皆大笑。轉瞬間勝負即分，余兄之虫翹然長嗚，其聲淸越，譚虫退逃矣。</p>
<p>此次尙有一可笑之事，是日來觀之人有楊士琦者，乃北洋大臣直隸總督楊士驤之弟，當兩「廣翼」酣鬥時，注精會神，下視鬥盆，兩手扶棹邊，余弟農先在其旁，亦垂頭觀之，忽鼻間鹽一濃涕，正落於士琦手背上，士琦爲看虫鬥，竟聽之不以爲意，有唾面自乾之雅量，可佩亦可笑已。</p>
<h3>兩個「右軍」</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>雖己交秋，小扇子猶未能在捐棄之列。友朋相逢，往往你看看我的扇子，我瞧瞧你的扇子；或批評字寫得好，或批評畫畫得不行。這已成爲常事。</p>
<p>那天有位甲友約我去同訪乙友。在他們正談得起勁的當兒，我把甲友的扇　取來一看。盡係晝匠所作。字還寫得不俗，因細一細一看，見上寫的是：</p>
<p>右軍筆法能將顏柳諸人熔「治」原寫如此），所以書法之好，眞是古人所難及！而文敏崛起數百年後而能得其神羅，實難得其人里所以筆法。」</p>
<p>下文如何，不得而知。署款是冒蘇州某氏之名。因這是難得拜讀的妙文，不可不一錄，所惜語氣未完！</p>
<p>翌日甲友邀我們小飲於其庽舍。晤乙友，取其扇筆看。字不談，畫的是「萬竿烟雨」，不過竿不像竿而像一帶」罷了。再一看題款，寫的是：</p>
<p>「撫（原寫如此）右軍筆法以奉××先生！」</p>
<p>署款是七十二叟××。這又是妙文，不可不一記。</p>
<p>兩日所見，可稱奇退。酒罷，我因笑勸他們，把二筆字一畫，合成雙璧，變成「二個右軍」！他們不解，經我說穿後，他們也哈哈大笑了。</p>
<h3>北湖春望</h3>
<p>— 徐澄宇</p>
<p>何處風光最可憐？北湖春軟浪如烟。遊人邀夢斜陽外，侍女尋歌短艇邊。望裏花雲都脈脈，飛來柳霧總翩翩。多情更有　紅在，一樣芳菲到綺筵。</p>
<p>綺筵春好又重開，春水春山繡作堆。到眼芳華初　蕩，驚心烽火忍徘徊。銜泥燕擬巢珠樹，負土　爭擁鉅槐。但乞凌虛　足穩，花邊小住卽蓬萊。</p>
<h3>簽字蓋章</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>現在有許多證件，如保證書之類，或有些表冊的塡報，印明塡具人須要「簽字蓋章」。這一種的時習，流行的期間，幷不怎樣的久遠。如果認爲岡章什麼人都可以代蓋，甚至容易假冒，故必須本人親自簽字爲憑，那麽旣簽字了，爲什麼又要蓋章？換一句說，是反證簽字與蓋章，都是靠不住。否則旣簽字，何必再蓋章？已經蓋章，簽字是多餘的。「簽字蓋章」，等於架床疊屋的笑話。</p>
<p>本來我國以前在機關　辦公牘的，無論擬稿，核稿，會稿，判行等，都是蓋章的。後來有人感到蓋章有許多流弊，故改用簽字。自然，簽字是比較蓋章來得實際而確切。因爲以前有許多主管的長官，自己不核閱公事的，秘書長（主任）也多是空有其名。機關裏的公事多是由一個秘書代爲核閱判行，而這一位秘書看過一件公事之後，便即順手蓋了主管長官，秘書長，和他人的岡章，有時且要代蓋副局長等的岡章。因此有人說，中國的行政是「圖章政治」。</p>
<p>有些主管的備了幾顆名章，自己身邊一個，隨從（機要）秘書一個，核稿秘書一個，監印處一個，公館一個。如果他有兼職的，那就每一個兼職的機關團體都放了一個備用。因爲辦公只認圖章不認人，故有些人的兼職十多處，甚至兼到遠隔數省的職事。無他，這是靠圖章做代表的了。</p>
<p>外國人在中國的銀行，郵局等領取匯款或支票，只要在粟據上簽字便可，最多也不過出示護照，便可收取。可是中國人向銀行·錢莊·郵局等領收款項，除了本人簽字之外，還要蓋章，且要舖保或銀行擔保代收，纔允付款·「無保不付」刻有固定的圖章，董在匯票解條上，這不知是誰弄的把戲，使收款人感到很大的艱困。有時有些人找不着舖保，出示身份說，也拿不着錢。近年郵局的匯票上，受款人項下寫明「簽字或蓋章」，這是便利的方法，眞是功德無量。</p>
<p>也許有人說，簽字容易假冒，故必須再加蓋章，其實容易假冒的，還是圖章而不是簽字，這是有點研究渦書法的人都能够明白的。可是舉世滔滔，相率盲從圖章爲信用的根據，而漠視本人一的簽字；更有要簽字與圖章併用的，這眞是匪夷所思的了。</p>
<h3>紙與筆</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>史稱漢和帝時，中常侍蔡倫，用樹膚蔴頭作紙，故今八皆謂是蔡倫所創，神廟中所供各行業之祖師，內有蔡倫塑像，翩翩年少，服裝如戲劇中之公子，未知何所本。但考班史趙后傳，有赫　，西京記稱薄蹏，注云小紙也；又三輔故事，稱衛太子以紙塞鼻；其時均在漢和帝之前，則紙係不始於蔡倫可知。或者至倫而始加工精製，故後人獨稱之耳。</p>
<p>筆不始於蒙恬，古人己言之矣，李石續博物志云：王數有言：書契以來，便應有筆，世傳始於蒙恬，殆非也。按太公曰：毫毛茂茂，陷水可脫，陷文不活。又孔子作孝經，簪縹筆，衣　單，向北而拜，可見筆之由來久矣。若謂當時係以刀刻畫爲筆，然太公毫毛茂茂之語，似己明指毛筆。筆經云：恬以鹿毛爲柱，羊毛爲被，可證筆至蒙恬而製益工，但非恬所創始也。惟並未及兎毫，韓昌黎毛穎傳，稱蒙恬次中山，拔其豪等語，殆游戲之文，未加深考也。至右軍筆經，始稱中山兎肥而毫長，似爲兎毫之始，淸人作楷，恒重紫毫，蓋紫毫堅銳，作字較勁挺有致，尤其科塲應試，如優貢拔貢，以及進士殿試之須以書法見長者，則幾非紫毫不行矣。書家如李梅　曾農髯，皆專用紫毫，雖字大逾尺，亦以紫毫爲之。（劉山農自謂其書不如曾李，係以不能用紫毫作大字之故。）又傳劉石菴一生專用紫毫，惟紫毫大筆之價値，數倍於羊毫，以此毫長鋒較少，剖製亦較難也。</p>
<h3>想到就做</h3>
<p>— 溪</p>
<p>美國某公司的經理覺得店裏的夥友都有做事遲疑不決的毛病，頗想改正這種風氣，就在店裏各處貼滿了標語，標語上是「想到就做」四個大字。</p>
<p>不久，標語發生了令人意想不到的效力！</p>
<p>他們的會計主任捲了一筆兩萬美元的公款逃走了；一位司賬員和他的美麗釣女秘書悄然私奔；十二個辦事員聯名要求加薪；寫字間裏一位小茶房一溜溜到了好萊塢去，說是想做電影明星。（譯自「皇冠」）</p>
<h3>史王薛</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>或問紅樓夢一書，所言何事耶？曰，昔曾再論之，意有未盡，考證之事，亦未能也。竊謂賈府旣爲貴族之家，即帝王家之縮影，作宮庭看，未爲不可。賈家數幕劇，即史上常見之外戚，母后等事，故紅樓夢亦即政治小說也。賈母似無大過，性亦仁厚，獨年老昏眊，惟耽逸樂，使王熙鳳得擅權。其子政，庸懦無能，適成愚孝。賈家幾敗，太君之罪也。太君將就木，繼之者王夫人。王氏貌若寬仁，實甚刻薄，其待金釧，晴雯，可爲一嘆。熙鳳，襲人，皆王氏黨，復引入薛姨媽，以張其軍。薛氏野心甚大，先附於王，以養其勢。政旣無用，珠已早死，蘭乃幼孫，故寶釵必取得寶玉，王系之勢始成。黛玉湘雲，皆非其敵。湘雲在史系式微之際，嘗試而敗，金麒麟事，一起即減，是史氏非王系敵之一證。鴛鴦殉主，岩非自知孤立，終必受辱乎？林妹妹屢歎無人做主，徒憑太君憐愛，終不足恃，縱善妒多疑，費盡心力，殊不堪以抗陰謀，適成犧牲品耳。寶玉縱不失蹤，未必爲治家良材，其性善變，寶釵襲人自可玩諸股　工之上，况旣失蹤，故謂王薛之謀已遂可也。史王薛先後把持賈氏家政，全書述事一貫，不問作者爲一人，爲二人，吾謂其意識如是。寶釵尙有腹中一塊肉，前途頗有希望，然李紈正養晦待時，蘭一長成，賈氏或可中興，李氏必可得勢，未知其時李薛兩家，誰勝誰負耳。使吾爲續書，當着眼於此。</p>
<h3>江建霞藏書</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>乙酉正月，余於蘇州護龍街書肆以僞幣八百元得江建霞舊藏「經籍訪古志」八冊。封面有建霞手筆題記日：「經籍訪古志六卷，附補遺一卷，八册。光緒己丑二月，朱子涵治中貽。師　記。一下鈐有「建霞一一印。書中著錄各書行格，皆以朱筆圈出，想據以輯「宋元本行格表」也。復有標注一二十條，稱景州陳衡山（舉）得宋刊本「中說」後，卽糊板重刻。衡山又得北宋刊本「二李唱和詩集」，景印後，卽以原書贈傳牟園（雲龍）。是皆書林逸事，足資談助。以宋刊本糊板重刻，則未免大煞風景也。</p>
<p>建設，名標；號萱　，又號雲　，師　，淸元和人人，爲葉爛裳入室弟子。嘗任湖南學政，光緒戊戌受命在總理衙門行走，康梁失敗，卽被放，隱居海上，以醇酒婦人自遺，不一年卽卒。「海花一中亦及其人，以「姜劍雲」隱射其名，固一風流跌岩標格不凡之美少年也。</p>
<p>建設藏書頗富，刻書亦多。在長沙日，嘗倩吳憲齋中丞繪「修書岡」。建霞自稱：「余無狗馬絲竹之好，又不能飲，惟日與書史相近近。……集錄先輩及同時人手稿付刻工，輯雲　閣業書若干卷，又得南宋書棚陳思刻唐人小集四十九家，景寫付梓，不失毫髮？……唐人小集印刻極精，曾以皮紙刷印若干部。蘇州某書肆曾以此書殘本染色冒充宋本，以欺吳瞿安先生，購歸數日，始發覺，則其書精好可知己。——「修書圖」一時名流題詞者無慮數十家，梁任公蝶花曰：「萬萬千千名下士，絮絮　蟲元元隨人計，欲索解人無一二。是東來法，西來意。後有鄱陽前泱潦，今有元和更凟橫行字。修取全球書目志，石渠天錄尋常事。」譚復生亦題詩，有云：「魯中汲汲彌縫者，誤盡羣鳥是舊巢。公意不嫌殺風景，直須取付祖龍燒。」「剗盡靈根尙有餘。來生懺悔又成虛。無聊驅壳相斯混，身已嫌多何况書！」梁譚二公，一時維新俊彥，侃侃而談，復生言尤伉爽，肖其爲人。爲學日益，老氏恒言，盡棄詩書，乃能入道。吳稚老所云焚盡綫裝書之言，猶未徹底也。戊戌前後，一時名士之言論如此。建霞固亦當時所稱「維新黨」也。</p>
<p>建霞著書亦甚富，「宋元本行格表一，「黃　國年讀」，則有涉於日錄板本之學者也。復能畫，花卉尤工。</p>

<h3>Commercial Banks and Firms to Submit Lists; Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange to be Transferred by Deadline; Xu Baiyuan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to督促辦理</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, was dispatched to Shanghai to, together with the Central Bank,督促辦理 the transfer of foreign exchange assets from various commercial banks and firms to the Central Bank. Mr. Xu arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and immediately went to the Central Bank to discuss the matter with Governor Yu Hongjun, Deputy Governor Liu Gongyun, and Director of the Gold and Foreign Exchange Control Bureau Lin Chongyong. They invited the heads of various commercial banks to talks in the morning and afternoon. Those invited included Li Fusun of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Xu Jilong of Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Dai Mingli of Shanghai United Bank, Qian Xinzhizhi of Zhongnan Bank, Xu Guomao of Jincheng Bank, Hu Huichun of China Industrial Bank, Yang Xizhi of China National Products Bank, and the heads of Juxingcheng Bank and Guangdong Bank, among ten banks. Mr. Xu solemnly informed them that they must submit detailed accounts to the government before the deadline, listing all foreign exchange, foreign currency, and foreign deposits, stocks, government bonds, gold, and silver held by their respective banks. Whether or not to transfer all of these assets in the future will be considered separately by the government. In addition, they discussed the transfer methods in detail. It is heard that the amount of foreign exchange to be transferred and the transfer methods for each bank and firm will be finalized by this afternoon at the latest.</p>
<p>[United Credit Reporting Agency] Regarding the transfer of foreign exchange from commercial banks and firms to the national bank, Li Ming, Chairman of the Bankers Association, stated that everything will be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations. After discussions with Governor Yu and Vice Minister Xu, it was decided to transfer the assets in batches, with the first batch to be delivered to the Central Bank on the 8th. Reports stated that commercial banks had collected ten million US dollars to sell to the Central Bank to resolve the matter. Mr. Li offered some explanation, stating that there had been a decision for small banks to sell to the Central Bank as a source of funds for increasing capital, which was separate from the transfer. The previous plan will now be abandoned in accordance with government laws and regulations. As for the issue of increasing bank capital, the banks and firms do not feel it is difficult because the amount of capital increase has been reduced by half from the original amount, so the amount to be increased is not large.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Li Fusun, Chairman of the Bankers and Trade Association, invited the directors to a discussion yesterday morning to review the matter of complying with the order to transfer foreign exchange assets. It was decided to have the association issue a document to notify all members to comply with the order. The method is for each bank and firm to create a list of their original foreign exchange assets based on their accounts, submit the list to the association, and then have the association submit it to the national bank to complete the registration procedures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the issue of commercial banks and firms depositing foreign exchange assets and gold and silver with the Central Bank, sources from relevant financial circles here revealed that if the persons in charge of various banks and firms violate these laws and regulations, their business operations may be subject to suspension.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to financial circles, some illegal commercial banks and firms have been escaping to Hong Kong with large amounts of assets. The operators of these banks and firms have been selling all or most of their assets and transferring them to Guangzhou, and then purchasing Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou to transfer the funds to Hong Kong. The financial authorities are paying close attention to this and will soon announce and implement strict measures.</p>
<h3>Xu Baiyuan Speaks; Government Guides Idle Capital; Considers Issuing Short-Term Treasury Bills and Gold Yuan Bonds; National Foreign Exchange Holdings to be Reported Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan met with reporters at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon and answered various questions. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The government's current plan to reform the currency system is comprehensive in nature, but for the time being, it will first focus on several key points, such as handling national foreign exchange declarations and prohibiting price increases for public utilities. The hope is to focus on key points and gradually promote the overall plan. The government is very serious about the implementation of this plan. (2) The transfer of foreign exchange from banks and firms is the first step in handling the national foreign exchange declaration. The second step will be to conduct a declaration of all foreign exchange held by the people. It is not known how much foreign exchange is held by banks and firms in total, but it is not as much as the rumored 400 million US dollars. (3) Domestic remittances are not currently strictly restricted, but the purpose of the remittances should be investigated. (4) The government will promote national savings measures to balance revenue and expenditure. Recently, the number of official cars assigned to the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan has been reduced by half as originally planned, which is one proof of the government taking the lead in advocating this. It is hoped that all sectors of society will follow suit. (5) The government will consider issuing short-term treasury bills and gold yuan bonds as a way to guide idle capital. The denomination and interest rate of these bonds are still being revised, and the issuance regulations are awaiting approval by the Legislative Yuan. (6) The government's reorganization of legal tender bonds will cost approximately 12 million gold yuan. (7) The issuance methods for the public sale of shares in state-owned enterprises will be drafted by the various state-owned enterprises. The government will make a public announcement of the entire plan within days. (8) There is no definite news about when the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Tianjin will reopen. (9) Regarding the leakage of information about the currency reform by officials of the Ministry of Finance and the selling of stocks, he, standing in the position of the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, expressed his shame. However, the matter is currently under investigation by all relevant parties, and he will not express more opinions.</p>
<h3>People's Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency; Four Banks Open Storage Services</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to the Central Bank, since the promulgation of the emergency decree on finance and economy, all gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people should be stored in this bank and its entrusted banks before the deadline of September 30th, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, Section 2 of the "Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People". In addition, foreign exchange assets deposited abroad should be declared and registered with this bank or its entrusted banks before the deadline, and transferred to this bank or its entrusted banks in the original currency, in accordance with the provisions of the "Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by the People of the Republic of China". The Business Bureau of this bank and the three entrusted banks, namely the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, will open the above two foreign currency and foreign exchange deposit services from the 7th. The branches of this bank and the three banks of China, Communications, and Agriculture in various places will open for business on the same day from the date of the Executive Yuan's announcement of the "Central Bank's Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Deposit Payment Measures."</p>
<h3>Reducing Vehicles to Save Gasoline</h3>
<p>Presidential Office and Ministry of National Defense Discuss Methods</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In order to promote thrift, President Chiang recently issued a hand order to the Presidential Office and the Ministry of National Defense to reduce vehicle travel by half to save gasoline consumption. After receiving the order, the relevant departments of the Presidential Office immediately convened a meeting to discuss specific methods, which will be implemented as soon as they are approved. The Ministry of National Defense, through the Fourth Department, drafted measures by Mo Chen and Cai Wenzhi, starting with saving gasoline. The amount of fuel issued to various military agencies in Nanjing this month has been reduced by half. The method for reducing vehicles will be implemented after approval.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Restricts Remittances</h3>
<p>No Bank or Firm May Conduct Hong Kong Remittances</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th] Zhu Ziwen, the supervisor of economic control in the Guangzhou area, in order to strictly control remittances from various banks and firms and stabilize finance, has formulated measures to restrict remittances: (1) No bank or firm may conduct Hong Kong remittances. Violators will be ordered to suspend business and will be severely punished according to law. (2) The total amount of remittances paid to various places by all banks and firms in Guangzhou City shall not exceed 200,000 yuan per day. Violators will be ordered to suspend business. (3) If remittances exceeding the aforementioned regulations must be paid for legitimate purposes, the reasons must be described in detail and submitted to the Guangzhou Central Bank for approval before they can be made. All banks and firms have unanimously expressed their support for these measures.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Hold Closed-Door Meeting; Executive Yuan Leaders Invited to Report on Financial and Economic Measures; Amendments to Organizational Law and Other Proposals All Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The first meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 7th. The meeting started at 9:30 a.m. with 369 members registered and 2478 members present. President Sun Ke, as chairman, first pointed out that the second item listed in the report matters, "The President's Consultation to promulgate the emergency decree on finance and economy and the supplementary measures to reorganize finance, as well as the measures to issue gold yuan notes, etc., please check the case," and explained it. He also suggested that no opinions be raised on this issue at the meeting that day, but instead be handled at a closed-door meeting on the 10th. Then, the report matters began according to the agenda. The minutes of the fifth, sixth closed-door meetings and the twenty-second meeting of the first session were adopted, and it was resolved to hold a closed-door meeting on the 10th, inviting leaders of the Executive Yuan to attend to report on the various measures of the financial and economic emergency disposal, and then discuss them exclusively. Then, the discussion matters began. The first case was a proposal by Chen Guyuan, Xiao Zheng, Song Shuqiao, and 30 others to amend Articles 24 and 30 of the Legislative Yuan's Rules of Procedure. The main purpose was to change the bi-weekly regular meetings to once a week, but each meeting must continue until all the proposals listed on the agenda have been discussed, in order to reduce the number of meetings and increase efficiency. However, it was ultimately opposed by a majority of members and was rejected. The second case was a proposal by Wu Hexuan, Chen Bosheng, and 33 others to amend Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law, to adjust and merge the existing committees according to the complexity of their business. Due to a malfunction in the lighting equipment in the meeting hall, the meeting was repeatedly disrupted and no conclusion was reached. The meeting adjourned in darkness at 11:45 a.m.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:45 p.m. President Sun took leave due to an affair, and Commissioner Chen Kewen was temporarily elected as chairman to continue the discussion on Wu Zhaoxu's proposal, but the result was still rejected. The proposal by Chen Guyuan and 50 others to amend Articles 4 and 5 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law to reduce the number of commissioners participating in the committee and to change the way the convener of each committee is generated to an election method, and the proposal by Zhang Qingzhen and 33 others to amend Article 8 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law so that all proposals are first reviewed before being submitted to the general meeting in order to speed up the progress of the proposals, were also successively opposed and rejected in a conservative atmosphere. The result of the full-day meeting on the 7th was that, in addition to formally passing three sets of minutes and deciding to hold another closed-door meeting, nothing was accomplished.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The thirtieth meeting of the Control Yuan was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 7th, with President Yu Youren presiding. After the Secretariat reported, Yu Peihou, a commissioner of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Administrative Office who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai, reported on the preparations for the establishment of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Administrative Office and explained the difficulties in taking over some affairs of the Shanghai Supervisory Commissioner's Office. After Mr. Yu's report, it aroused some commissioners' arguments, with Liu Pingjiang being the most激烈的, believing that it should be thoroughly investigated because the Control Yuan's职权 is to supervise and impeach others for dereliction of duty and corruption, etc., and now it has happened in this院, so it should be澈查 according to the situation. Later, other commissioners advocated that the discussion should be tạm绥. Then, other proposals were proceeded with. The proposals discussed in today's meeting are as follows: (1) The draft amendment to the Control Yuan's office regulations was passed. (2) The draft general rules for handling affairs by the various committees of the Control Yuan were passed.

<h3>Government Comprehensively Reorganizes Old Debts; Simultaneously Considers the Burden on the National Treasury and the Interests of Bondholders; Chen Bingzhang Talks About the Two Meanings of Reorganizing Old Debts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In accordance with the provisions of the emergency decree on finance and economy promulgated by the President, the Ministry of Finance had proposed and the Executive Yuan's Provisional Political Affairs Meeting approved the measures for handling legal tender bonds and foreign currency bonds and the principles for issuing reorganization bonds in the 37th year. According to Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance: The significance of the government's approval of the reorganization of old debts this time can be divided into the following two points: (1) Regarding foreign currency bonds, according to the short-term treasury bills in the 36th year and the foreign currency government bonds in the 27th, 29th, and 31st years, the repayment of principal and interest due was originally converted into legal tender according to the official foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank (12,000 yuan of legal tender per US dollar). After the revision of the foreign exchange management measures in August last year, in order to protect the interests of bondholders, the government changed the conversion to legal tender according to the market price of the designated bank's US dollar. After the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement certificate system in June this year, the Bankers Association in Beijing and Shanghai presented to the Ministry, suggesting that the foreign currency bonds be recovered in advance at one time according to the balance sheet settlement rate (474,000 yuan of legal tender per US dollar). Later, the Supervisory Committee of the 36-year short-term treasury bills and US dollar government bond fund and the National Bankers Association also sent letters suggesting that the principal and interest be repaid on time according to the balance sheet settlement rate plus the market price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate (approximately 4.5 million yuan at the time). The government could have adopted and implemented the above two suggestions. Now, in order to consider the bondholders' desire to maintain the currency value, the government has decided that the face value of foreign currency bonds will be calculated according to the legal exchange rate, with each US dollar converted into 4 gold yuan, which is 12 million legal tender, which is several times better than the hopes suggested by all parties, which proves the government's efforts to maintain credit. At the same time, in order to alleviate the current burden on the national treasury, it was decided to exchange the four foreign currency bonds into gold yuan government bonds according to the legal exchange rate. Although the repayment period of the new bonds is slightly longer than the remaining repayment period of the old bonds, the extension is only about two and a half to six years, and the new bonds are convenient for payment and can maintain the exchange rate against the US dollar. This handling method was originally drafted in accordance with the President's emergency decree, and it can be said that both the interests of bondholders and the burden on the national treasury are taken into consideration, which is beneficial to both parties. (2) Regarding legal tender bonds, the principal and interest of legal tender bonds have always been repaid at a one-to-one ratio according to the face value of the legal tender, in accordance with the regulations, and this was also done in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War. This is because government bonds are different from ordinary loans. The funds raised by the government's sale of bonds are used for national expenditures at any time, unlike banks and enterprises that can use the deposits they absorb for profit-making operations. Moreover, bond tickets can be freely transferred and circulated, and the current holders may not all be the original subscribers. Therefore, since the复员, the courts in various places have made different judgments on the cases of banks' pre-war deposits and private loans being repaid at double the amount, but government bonds have been specially excluded and are not subject to double repayment. Now, with the currency reform, in order to understand the enthusiasm of the ticket holders for purchasing bonds to help the country in the past, the government does not hesitate to increase the burden on the national treasury and resolutely decides to give them graded multiple repayments to show preferential treatment. Moreover, the calculation of the remaining period of various legal tender bonds according to their original repayment period shows that the shortest period is still several years and the longest is more than 33 years. Now, the government will repay them all in advance at one time regardless of the length of the remaining repayment period. The multiple of graded repayment ranges from a maximum of 27,000 times to a minimum of 1,000 times. For example, taking the bonds issued before the war as an example, the price is higher than the暗市 price of the Shanghai unified government bonds on August 19 this year. Assuming that it is calculated according to the appendix of the pre-war deposit and loan settlement regulations of the banking industry, the number of principal and interest that should be repaid per yuan is about eight times more than the number of multiple repayments of various government bonds. The government has done its best to make this decision in the face of extreme financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Chen finally said that in European and American countries, whenever there is a foreign war or a major change in the fire, the value of currency has always depreciated, but it is rare to see the fact that government bonds are repaid at double the amount, and it is rare to hear that the people have asked for double repayment. After the First European War, the French franc depreciated significantly, and the people, thinking of the government's financial difficulties, concentrated the bonds they held in the square and burned them in public to show their sincerity in helping the country. Their patriotism is very touching. My country has been fighting for more than eight years, and the government has issued government bonds before and after the Anti-Japanese War, which were enthusiastically subscribed by patriotic people in various places to help the country overcome difficulties. Overseas Chinese compatriots have remitted their savings from their daily节衣缩食 to purchase them from afar, and their spirit of急公好义 and caring for their motherland is especially worthy of praise for the virtues of our nation. However, the war has been prolonged, and the destruction is significant. The losses of life and property of the people across the country are incalculable. It is also an inevitable fact of the war that some government bondholders have suffered losses due to currency depreciation. Now, the government is planning and clearly reorganizing the old debts, and at the beginning of the currency reform, when the finance is still difficult, the legal tender bonds are graded and revalued, and they are repaid in advance. For foreign currency bonds, the exchange rate is raised, and new bonds are allocated. The government also has unified repayment procedures and simplifies the convenience of debt administration, which is truly a multi-purpose measure. It is deeply believed that all old debt holders will be able to understand the government's intention to maintain, and will uphold the past patriotic enthusiasm and support this measure in order to promote the country's finances to quickly move towards a stable path.</p>

<h3>Mourning the National Tragedy of Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Dr. Edvard Beneš, the founding father of Czechoslovakia, passed away on the 3rd of this month. Today, Czechoslovakia is holding a state funeral for Dr. Beneš. Beneš's death has shocked every corner of the world. Not only are the people of Prague weeping in sorrow, but people all over the world are mourning and praising the death of this giant who struggled arduously throughout his life for his country's freedom, democracy, and peace. Beneš's death is indeed not only a loss for Czechoslovakia, but also a great loss for the entire world. Since the Czechoslovak coup in February and the suicide of Foreign Minister Masaryk, the difficulties faced by Beneš have been of concern to democratic countries around the world. This March, there were rumors that Beneš had committed suicide out of grief and indignation, and later there were rumors that he was weak and ill. It was not until June 7, when Beneš resigned from the presidency, that we knew he was still alive and living in seclusion in the suburbs of Prague, engaged in writing his memoirs of the war. Unexpectedly, only three months later, Dr. Beneš passed away!</p>
<p>Today, on this national day of mourning in Czechoslovakia, the grief of the people throughout the country is truly "as if they had lost their own parents." The masses who automatically went to pay their respects to Beneš's remains can be said to have emptied the streets. This is certainly the "posthumous honor" that Beneš deserved, but the true intentions of the Czech people can also be seen from the unprecedented grandeur of Beneš's state funeral.</p>
<p>Beneš's life can be said to have been entirely for the freedom, democracy, and peace of his country. Although Beneš, like others, went from primary school to secondary school, and from secondary school to university, specializing in philosophy, he was inspired by his teacher Masaryk (the founding father of Czechoslovakia, i.e., the first president) at the University of Prague, and later devoted himself to revolution. Although Beneš also studied in Paris and London, his purpose was to study the Austro-Czech problem. As soon as he completed his studies, he returned to Prague to teach at his alma mater and, together with Masaryk, organized the "Realist Party." The teacher and student cooperated to promote the theory of Czech independence. Therefore, Dr. Beneš was a promising young man who was loyal to his country from an early age.</p>
<p>During Masaryk's leadership in Czechoslovakia's independence, Beneš was always responsible for diplomatic work. When the "Czech National Council" was established in Paris in 1915, Beneš served as the secretary-general of the council, planning the grand strategy for Czech independence and organizing international intelligence and propaganda agencies. His first successful attempt was to obtain recognition of the "National Council" by the Allied Powers as the provisional government of Czechoslovakia. At the end of October 1918, Masaryk returned to Prague and declared independence to the outside world. Masaryk became the first president, and Beneš became the foreign minister, remaining in Paris to attend the Versailles Peace Conference. He used his diplomatic skills to win back many rights for his country, so that the world would no longer believe the outdated idea that "weak countries have no diplomacy." However, when President Masaryk resigned in 1935 and Beneš succeeded him as the second president, not only was Czechoslovakia in trouble, constantly in a state of turmoil, but Beneš's fate was also fraught with difficulties. He encountered the rise of Nazi Germany's aggressive forces, which not only harbored ambitions for Austria and Poland, but also coveted Czechoslovakia for a long time. Relying on his foresight and flexible diplomatic skills, Beneš wanted to unite Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist the outward expansion of German forces. However, figures like French Prime Minister Daladier and British Prime Minister Chamberlain were short-sighted and adopted a policy of appeasement towards Hitler, sacrificing the interests of friendly countries, which led to the Munich Conference scandal, which returned the newly emerging Czechoslovakia to fragmentation. Even Dr. Beneš, who loved his country, could not bear the pressure from Germany and fled to Britain and the United States. The pain in Beneš's heart cannot be described by pen and ink, not even a fraction of it.</p>
<p>However, Beneš was still able to endure what others could not endure, and remained optimistic about the future of Czechoslovakia. He predicted that World War II would break out sooner or later, and actively prepared for it. In September 1939, the war broke out as expected. Beneš immediately went from the United States to Britain and organized a "government in exile" in London to continue the Czech independence movement. He believed that the restoration of Czechoslovakia must rely on the assistance of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and that none could be missing. Therefore, during the war, he spared no effort to travel across the ocean, first visiting the United States and then traveling to Moscow to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union. In 1945, the Nazis surrendered. Beneš triumphantly returned to Prague on the 16th, and all his long-cherished wishes were fulfilled. We cannot but praise Beneš's glorious achievements. It is a pity that Beneš's good times did not last long. The complex and volatile situation in Europe after the war became increasingly intense, making Czechoslovakia a microcosm of the world. Although Beneš only knew how to work for a free, democratic, and peaceful Czechoslovakia, and tried every means to mediate conflicts between various political parties in order to achieve domestic peace and democracy, the coup in February this year completely destroyed Beneš's efforts. Not only did the Czechoslovak Communist Party implement a one-party dictatorship, but Beneš was also politically isolated and lost his footing. Therefore, he retired into seclusion and died in depression.</p>
<p>Recently, we saw Beneš's "War Memoirs" published in the National Weekly published in the United States, which further increased our admiration and respect for him. He was not only a Czech politician, diplomat, and revolutionary, but also an outstanding international statesman. He believed in democracy, sought freedom, longed for peace, and yearned for an ideal world. He followed a middle path domestically and was like a third party internationally. He advocated that the East and the West should work together to create world peace. However, things did not go as he wished, and none of his ideals were realized, and none of his efforts were successful. Now, Beneš is sleeping in the ground, and even this bridge connecting the East and the West has been broken! The great beam is broken, and the wise man withers. This is not only a misfortune for Czechoslovakia, but a misfortune for the entire world!</p>
<h3>People's Organizations in Beiping Telegraph the Central Government, Requesting That the "7-5 Incident" Be Handled According to Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] Since the publication of the investigation report and impeachment by Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui regarding the "7-5 Incident," it has been rumored that Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi took responsibility and telegraphed requesting punishment. People's organizations in Beiping believe that the military, police, and gendarmerie responsible for security in the "7-5 Incident" were carrying out their duties according to law and should not be punished for dereliction of duty. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the President, the heads of the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan, and the Minister of National Defense, requesting that the case be handled according to law to uphold justice. The telegram states: "Northeast students, unable to bear the oppression of the traitorous bandits, made their way into the interior to continue their studies. Due to the large number of students arriving temporarily, the responsible authorities failed to make timely arrangements, resulting in displacement. The Municipal Council was concerned and passed a resolution recommending relief, which was misunderstood by the students, leading to the 7-5 Incident. All aftermath matters and responsibilities for the incident are being handled by specialists appointed by Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi to assess the situation. It is heard that Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui came to Beiping to investigate and recently issued a report and impeachment, holding the security authorities responsible for dereliction of duty. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, with a humble attitude, took responsibility and requested punishment, which surprised all citizens. The investigation report of the two Committee members, Gu and Hu, generally corresponds to the facts and circumstances of the day, but the proposed responsibility for the incident seems to lack careful consideration. The actual situation and legal viewpoints are presented below for your consideration and adoption: (1) At the time of the 7-5 Incident, bad elements mixed in and took the opportunity to instigate. The first shot was fired from the student side, which is a fact described in the investigation report. Therefore, the responsibility for the incident should be borne by the bad elements who took the opportunity to instigate, which should not be difficult to point out correctly. (2) The tragedy occurred after martial law was declared, which was not noted in the report. The students, numbering four to five thousand, took advantage of the crowd to destroy the Municipal Council and assault the police and gendarmerie officers maintaining order. After destroying the Municipal Council, they went to the East 交民巷 (Embassy District), where foreign consulates were located, and surrounded the residence of Speaker Xu. In order to prevent the traitorous bandits from taking advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble in the special environment of the East 交民巷, the security authorities, based on the instructions of the highest military officer, declared temporary martial law and dispatched troops to be on alert. According to martial law regulations, after martial law is declared, the military and police are required to carry guns to deal with emergency situations in order to protect the safety of 1.8 million citizens and the area related to the views of both Chinese and foreigners in the East 交民巷, which is a matter of course. Even if an accident occurs due to the prevention of riots, there is no legal responsibility, which is also common practice in various countries. (3) The 208th Division is the designated unit responsible for city defense. After martial law was declared, there were no other armed forces available for deployment except for the deployment of this division. The report also states that field troops should not be deployed to be responsible for internal city guards, which seems to be an insufficient observation of the actual situation. (4) This city has numerous schools and has always been a base for lurking traitorous bandits to create incidents. Evidence shows that at the time of the 7-5 Incident, non-Northeast students raised flags to incite and openly shout slogans. On July 9th, they openly violated the martial law order and gathered to parade and petition, shouting slogans such as 'Shoot Fu Zuoyi,' which clearly indicates that traitorous bandits were manipulating and directing them from behind the scenes. In summary, the original report and impeachment are very clear in identifying the facts, but the assignment of responsibility is inappropriate, and the legal viewpoints do not seem to have been fully considered. All people should be equal before the law, and students should not be given preferential treatment. Officials should not be held accountable for taking unavoidable measures due to their responsibilities, especially in student incidents. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi defends North China. Amidst military affairs, he personally supervises and arranges for Northeast students in many ways, and he has no responsibility to bear. The security authorities have also made the greatest tolerance and effort in the 7-5 Incident, and should not be punished for dereliction of duty. In order to prevent the dignity of the law from being distorted due to the environment, and to prevent the recurrence of chaos in Beiping due to the military and police not daring to fully exercise their powers, we hereby jointly telegraph our sincere request for consideration of the situation and handling of the case according to law, in order to appease public anger and curb the sprouts of chaos. The telegram is urgent and awaits your orders." Jointly submitted by the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Labor Union, Farmers' Association, Women's Association, Education Association, Lawyers Association, and Journalists Association.</p>

Any internal conflicts in the Eastern European Communist Party will be beneficial to the democratic countries of Western Europe. If the Soviet Union's position continues to weaken, the Soviet leaders may have to take action in order to restore their prestige and tighten control over their satellite countries.</p>
<p>Polish Communists Begin Purging Party, Situation in Czech Republic Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Warsaw, June 6th] Observers here predict that after the dismissal of Polish Communist Party Secretary-General Gomulka, one-quarter to one-third of the 1 million members of the Polish Communist Party will be "purged."

Others say that the purge will be delayed until after the completion of the merger of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, June 6th] Yugoslav Marshal Tito's almost unbelievable public defiance of the Kremlin has spread to Poland on the 6th. Stalin is facing the defection of important figures in the Iron Curtain, South and Poland, while he is conducting important negotiations with Western countries in the Cold War. Who will be the next to defect among the Soviet Eastern European satellite countries? And how contagious is this matter? Western diplomats are closely watching Czechoslovakia, and are predicting that there will be demonstrations during the state funeral of former Czech President Benes on the 8th. Stalin is currently overwhelmed after the death of Zhdanov, the former head of the Communist International Bureau and supervisor of the Eastern European Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Soviet Officer Flees to England: Reveals Soviet War Preparations Secrets; Politburo Decisions Violate Public Opinion</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 6th] Soviet Army Colonel Tokaev, described as a "mysterious figure behind the scenes," who recently fled his country and arrived in London, held a press conference today. Correspondents from various Western newspapers attended, as did a correspondent from TASS. The TASS correspondent denounced Tokaev as a traitor and raised various questions. Tokaev replied, "I believe that exposing the kind of rule the Soviet people live under now will greatly help them. I have now left the Soviet Union, and I will not answer such questions. For the past thirty-eight years, I have been silent for my survival, but even if I now want to say what I want to say in my heart, it would be useless, because TASS news is enough to distort my words."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] Soviet jet propulsion expert Colonel Tokaev, formerly an aide to Marshal Sokolovsky, accused the Soviet Politburo on the 6th of preparing for a Third World War. Tokaev recently fled to the British zone of occupied Germany and then to England. He told United Press, "The Third World War is being prepared. The officials engaged in preparing for this are the fourteen members and candidate members of the Politburo. I know very well that the Politburo's policy, which is based on preparing for a Third World War, is absolutely not in line with the interests and needs of the Soviet people or the people of any country in the world, so I am unwilling to be a tool and partner in this policy. I disregarded participating in this policy and therefore left." (The Soviet Politburo is the highest executive body of the Soviet Communist Party. Its members include Premier Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov, among others.) Tokaev announced at a press conference that ninety percent of the Soviet people and seventy percent of Soviet Communist Party members would not support the current regime in a free election. Tokaev is the latest Soviet official to renounce his nationality and oppose his government. He, his wife, and two daughters have been living in a British cottage in recent months, fearing the Soviet secret police, and have requested that no photographs be taken.</p>
<h3>South Korean Political Corruption Disappoints US Officials; North-South Korean Dispute to be Submitted to the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 7th] The North-South Korean dispute will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in Paris this month, but a real solution seems unattainable before the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops. From various perspectives, the South Korean government of Syngman Rhee appears to be on shaky ground. The South Korean government still lacks a strong military organization, and even its internal unity is questionable. Although the atmosphere was very optimistic when the South Korean parliament opened in Seoul on May 31st, US officials are disappointed by the corruption of the situation. The most disappointing thing is Syngman Rhee's first cabinet. Rhee has studied the governments of various countries around the world, but when he chooses his cabinet members, he does not select wise and capable officials, but only repays political debts. After the list of cabinet members was announced, they all abused their power for personal gain, and various political groups competed for control of the armed forces. If South Korea is to prepare for the anti-communist struggle that is coming, it will require the greatest efforts of the United States and even greater assistance from the South Korean people themselves.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Discusses New Economic Reforms; Schuman Expected to Overcome Difficulties; Communist and Right-Wing Members to Submit Motions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] The first item in the Schuman government's economic reform plan is to distribute an August living allowance to every worker. Now, his new coalition cabinet will face its first test in the National Assembly on the 7th. Communist and right-wing members have raised questions about the government's organization and its economic policies. However, the government, which was formed this weekend, is expected to safely overcome this major hurdle.</p>
<p>During a meeting of the Schuman cabinet on the evening of the 5th, the first item of business was to stipulate that a subsidy of eight francs be distributed to all workers in private industry for the months of July and August. At the same time, the cabinet increased the price of bread from 24 francs (8 cents) to 35 francs (11 cents) per 2.2 pounds. At the same time, in order to concretely reduce government spending, the cabinet ordered some departments to immediately lay off staff, while other departments would gradually reduce staff. Government spokesman Midland said: Other economic reforms include tax cuts, lower meat prices, increased family rations, and a decision on the September living allowance. Schuman may ask parliament to extend the discussion of the government's economic policies to reduce the government's difficulties. He can also accept the discussion, and if possible, he can even ask parliament to vote for an early recess.</p>
<h3>Nehru Officially Announces to Parliament: Hyderabad Intrusion Offends; Indonesia Asks Hyderabad to Stop Terrorist Actions</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru told Parliament on the 7th that Indian and Hyderabad armies had engaged in battle within Indian territory. Nehru said that the government received reports on the 6th that Hyderabad troops had invaded, and that the invading troops were the Razakars of Hyderabad. The Razakars are a radical Muslim organization that supports Hyderabad's independence and opposes Hyderabad joining the Indian Union. Nehru said that the navy attacked with armor, but was repelled, destroying one vehicle and capturing one officer and eighty-five soldiers.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru announced on the 7th that India had requested to station troops in Hyderabad in order to "restore law and order in the state." The Hyderabad prince has refused the Indian troops' request to enter. Nehru said, "We may be on the eve of a serious incident in the country." He also said that India has made a "final" request that the prince disband the radical Muslim group Razakars and stop their terrorist actions.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Calls for US-Soviet Resumption of Negotiations: "For the Sake of Both the US and the Soviet Union, Efforts Should be Renewed to Reach Consensus on a Treaty with Germany."</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seattle, 6th] Former US Secretary of State Byrnes today called for a resumption of negotiations with the Soviet Union and defended the Yalta Agreement, saying that without the agreement, the Soviet Union would have gained more territory in China and Japan. Byrnes called on Western countries to resume negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German issue, saying that even if the Soviet Union has the possibility of further aggression, "we cannot therefore give up all hope of peace talks."</p>
<p>Yalta Agreement: China Agreed in Advance</p>
<p>Looking back on the events that occurred during his tenure, Byrnes said that China had already fully agreed to the Soviet Union's demands at Yalta. Byrnes said that only when he learned that Molotov had made further demands on China in Moscow in July 1945 did he state to the Chinese people: "The United States does not support the Soviet Union in making further demands on China." Byrnes emphasized that the reasonableness of the Soviet Union's demands should be judged based on the time period. At that time, without the Yalta Agreement, the Soviet Union would have gained more territory in China. He pointed out that the Yalta Agreement was held six weeks after the Cherbourg campaign. At that time, no one dared to say when the war would end. Furthermore, the atomic bomb had not yet been invented, and military leaders estimated that attacking the Japanese mainland would require one million soldiers. He said, "If we had to attack Japan at that time, and if it had continued for six months, the Soviet Union might have already actually occupied all the land that the Yalta Agreement agreed to cede. And if there had been no Yalta Agreement, the land occupied by the Soviet Union would have been even larger." Byrnes raised several questions, saying: If the United States had to attack Japan, would the American people—especially parents—want the Soviet Union to stay out of it? Could the United States prevent the Soviet Union from participating in anything? Furthermore, if the Soviet Union joined the war, and at the same time there was no agreement agreeing that MacArthur would be the supreme commander, would we encounter similar problems in Japan as we encountered in Europe?</p>
<p>US-Soviet Agreement: Not Actually a Surrender</p>
<p>Byrnes defended the previous agreements between the US and the Soviet Union, saying, "Some people think that all mediation is nothing more than surrender. This is a dangerous misconception. If we want to work for peace, we should not destroy all hope of peace talks for fear of high costs." He said that based on his personal experience, it is indeed not easy to deal with the Soviet Union, but efforts should still be made. Byrnes declared that Soviet leaders would not rashly participate in a war unless they thought they could defeat us. They believe that war is a necessary means for national survival. Since Soviet leaders are afraid of war, they probably will not miss any opportunity to increase their power and status without war. The Czech incident this spring is a clear example of this. Byrnes said that in order to "maintain peace," the United States' military buildup plan should be maintained, but "most importantly, other countries should recognize that the United States does not want to control any country. As for the European countries, which have often suffered from war, they certainly do not want their territory to become a battlefield for competing with the Soviet Union." "We must convince them that we are their allies fighting to preserve freedom, and we do not want to use them as collateral or as satellite countries in the struggle with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>The People of the Soviet Union Also Do Not Want War</p>
<p>Byrnes said, "Some people say that because of the Soviet Union's attitude, we have realized that we cannot build one world, we must build two worlds. This pessimistic view also has some reason, but I do not give up hope. Before this, we have also seen governments change their policies. We do not know what is behind the iron curtain, but the Eastern European countries feel uneasy about it. We can conclude that the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the United States absolutely do not want war. So we hope that the Soviet people's desire for peace and improving their living standards can influence the Soviet leaders to change their policies." "For the sake of both the US and the Soviet Union, we should renew our efforts to reach a consensus on a treaty with Germany. If Germany becomes collateral or an assistant in the struggle between the East and the West, it will not benefit either the United States or the Soviet Union." Byrnes concluded his speech by saying, "As long as people are willing to come together to discuss problems, even if the words are somewhat disrespectful, there will eventually be hope for an agreement. But if someone stops negotiating, the other negotiators had better prepare for war."</p>
<p>Disarm Germany: Withdraw Troops from All Countries</p>
<p>Byrnes' call comes in the wake of hopes that the four foreign ministers may reopen negotiations in the fall. Byrnes intends to use the following points as a reference for the agreement:</p>
<p>First, "Germany...should be disarmed and remain so for at least a generation. This is in the great interest of both the US and the Soviet Union." Second, "When a suitable German government is established, the troops of the four occupying countries should be withdrawn immediately. A small number of security forces will remain to monitor Germany's disarmament." Byrnes acknowledged that both sides cannot trust each other, but he said, "Therefore, there needs to be a treaty...Germany should be disarmed for forty years." Two years ago, Byrnes himself made this suggestion to the Soviet Union. Mentioning that international co-management of the Ruhr region may cause disputes, Byrnes said that the management of the Ruhr "may be handed over to Germany's neighbors." As for compensation and other disputes, Byrnes said, "The Soviet Union should not gain more than what it already has in the Potsdam Agreement."</p>

<h3>Fifteen Underground Banks Busted Under Order of the Financial Control Bureau; Heads Released on Bail Pending Account Audits</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Financial Control Bureau recently received a secret order from the Economic Control Committee to severely crack down on underground banks.

<h3>One Brokerage Firm Violates the Law; Will be Subject to Suspension</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The person in charge of Dingxin Fumingji Brokerage, No. 14, Xiangkang Lane, Tianjin Road in this city, is Xu Songsun, director of the Xinxin Market Office of Nantong County Bank.

The association's charter was then adopted, and twenty-seven directors, including Jiang Hao, Shao Yongsheng, and Jiang Zhonghe, were elected, along with eleven supervisors, including Lu Yinchu. Finally, resolutions were passed to petition the Executive Yuan and the Municipal Council to freeze rents in accordance with the emergency economic plan and to continue paying rent at the original rate of seven thousand or nine thousand times the base rent, converted into Gold Yuan, among other major cases.</p>
<h3>Yongtaihe Smuggling Cigarettes: Turned Over to Yizhong for Sale at Controlled Prices; Confiscated Hoarded Yarn Reported to the Ministry for Instructions on Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the currency reform, the Economic Supervisory Office and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau successively uncovered hoarded goods such as cigarettes and yarn in an effort to stabilize prices and curb hoarding. Among them, the most cigarettes were seized from the Yongtaihe Tobacco Shop. After verification by the Yizhong Tobacco Company, it was confirmed that the cigarettes were distributed to Yongtaihe by Yizhong. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to turn them over to Yizhong for direct sale to cigarette merchants at controlled prices. As for the confiscated yarn and other goods, the Municipal Government has reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions on how to handle them. The sale of other confiscated materials is currently under discussion.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Attends Tea Party: Welcomed by Various Sectors; Reports on His Impressions of His Recent Trip Abroad; Praises the Democratic Spirit of Britain and America</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Various sectors of this city held a tea party at the Lido Garden at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to welcome Vice President Chen Lifu and his wife, who had just returned from overseas. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Tao Xisheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhao Zukang, Li Ximou, Ni Bi, Xu Xueyu, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jifei, and others attended. Vice President Chen arrived to the sound of military music, while his wife was unable to attend due to a foot ailment. Mayor Wu, as chairman, delivered a welcoming speech, praising Chen as a visionary in the struggle between democratic and communist ideologies, whose vision was the farthest-reaching, and who was the strongest proponent of anti-communism in those years. Chen immediately rose amidst applause and briefly described the proceedings of the Moral Re-Armament Conference. He said that the conference has a ten-year history, and its host, Dr. Buchman, had traveled to China, met with the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and had a deep affection for China. The theories he espoused were also similar to Chinese philosophy. The Moral Re-Armament Conference originated in Oxford, England, where a few people deeply felt the threat of materialism and that democracy had no theory to combat it, hence the initiation of the conference. After its establishment, it had the greatest impact in Northern Europe and also had considerable influence in the South Hams area of England. In recent years, after it spread to the United States, the people there deeply felt that the development of material civilization was gradually reducing human love and that the future crisis was unpredictable, so they were happy to accept it, and it developed rapidly. The Moral Re-Armament Movement has four standards: honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love, and advocates that democratic politics should be based on morality, with the ultimate goal of world peace. At this conference, most of the participants had been to China, so they had a good impression of China. As for how this movement will develop in China, I have not yet thought about it at this time. In fact, China has had this virtue since ancient times; today, we know it but have not practiced it.</p>
<p>Personal Freedom: Absolutely Respected</p>
<p>Chen went on to talk about American democratic politics, saying that he had been personally invited to attend the Democratic and Republican Parties' conventions in Philadelphia and deeply felt their characteristics, which were the absolute respect for personal freedom, but at crucial moments, they could unite for the party and prevent rifts from occurring. In politics, the use of people and money was completely transparent. The public can listen in on city council meetings. If more than half agree, they can also speak. He deeply felt that the greatest advantage of democratic politics is that it allows those in power to have regular contact with the people, and their words and deeds must represent the true interests of the people, resulting in clean and effective politics. As we begin constitutional governance, we must sincerely and earnestly learn from the strengths of other countries. At the same time, the completion of democratic politics still requires the virtue of patience.</p>
<p>Praising Britain: Spirit of Hard Work</p>
<p>Chen praised Britain's spirit of hard work and law-abidingness, saying that the Labour Party's policies were quite similar to those of the Father of the Nation. Britain suffered heavy losses during the war. Taking housing as an example, more than two million houses were destroyed by missiles, but the speed of its reconstruction was also surprising. "The results of rationing and control are particularly excellent. The domestic life of the rich and poor is consistent, and the best quality goods are used for export to earn foreign exchange. Comparing the material lives of the three countries—Britain, America and China, America is 'naturally endowed and has everything; Britain has nothing except for life necessities; and in our country, some have too much, and some have too little.'" The British pay special attention to abiding by the law, and the people have a high level of knowledge, so the implementation of government orders does not encounter any difficulties. The president of the Bank of England told me: After consulting with the heads of various trade associations on any economic plan, it can be implemented without obstruction, and the great power given to the government can be reserved and not used. The high efficiency of British politics can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Working Together: The Only Way to Succeed</p>
<p>Finally, Vice President Chen discussed the situation in China, saying that currency reform is by no means the solution to all economic problems. The current situation is still extremely serious, and we must work together to overcome the difficulties. I believe that there must be moral strength behind politics and economics. Everyone must start from themselves, and it requires the joint efforts of many people to succeed. Chen's speech lasted more than two hours. His words were precise and his attitude sincere, moving all who heard him. The welcome meeting ended at 5:45 PM.</p>

<h3>Typhoon Dissipates: Threat to the City Lifted; Clearing Skies Expected Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Pacific typhoon passed through the Taiwan Strait the day before yesterday. After its center reached the Fuzhou and Wenzhou area, it landed on the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang. Due to the resistance of the mountains, it dissipated after a night, and its force was greatly reduced. At the same time, its direction also began an arc-shaped change, gradually pointing from northwest-north to northeast-north. Yesterday morning, it went out to sea south of Ningbo, passed through the Zhoushan Islands in the evening, and continued to move northeast-north, but the speed was extremely slow. According to the meteorological station's prediction, the typhoon will dissipate in the East China Sea and become an ordinary low-pressure system. This city was not directly hit yesterday. The wind force in the concession area was around level 4 (the strongest typhoon force is level 17, which can reach 136 miles per hour). The sea surface outside Wusongkou still had a level 8 force. However, because the hurricane brought hot air, and the city was covered by cold air from North China in the previous days, the two met, resulting in torrential rain like a waterfall until yesterday afternoon. According to the meteorological station's statistics at 5:00 PM, the rainfall had reached 2.19 inches. Low-lying roads in the city were flooded again, especially the area near the three major companies on Nanjing Road and the area around Lin Sen Middle Road and Yuyuan Road, which became a vast expanse of water. The rain stopped by the evening, and the skies will begin to clear this afternoon. However, there may still be considerable waves at sea. Air and sea traffic are expected to return to normal completely from tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yesterday's minimum temperature was 23.2 degrees Celsius (73.7 degrees Fahrenheit), and the maximum temperature was 25.7 degrees Celsius (78.2 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>The Jiangya wheel on the Shanghai-Ningbo line suspended exports yesterday, and the Jiangjing wheel was in Ningbo and did not come. The Xilin, an express wheel on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, was also suspended yesterday and changed to sail to Tianjin this morning.</p>
<p>Pumping Stations Make Every Effort to Dredge</p>
<p>Also, news: Since 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, heavy rain has been pouring down in this city and it had not stopped by yesterday afternoon, this was the first heavy rain since autumn, causing water accumulation in various low-lying areas of the city. It is said that this accumulation of water was due to the high tide of the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, which caused the drainage ditches to be unable to discharge the water, resulting in tidal backflow. The Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, immediately went to inspect the waterlogged roads in various districts with the Director of the Drainage Department, Lu Jifang. The roads with water accumulation included the front of the Xinxin Company on Guangxi Road, the intersection of Yunnan Road and Fuzhou Road, Fuzhou Road (between Yunnan Road and Zhejiang Road), the area between Sichuan Road and Erma Road, the area between Yunnan Road and Beihai Road, the intersection of Wuma Road and Zhejiang Road, and the intersection of Maoming Road (the Thirteen-Story Building), as well as Linsen Middle Road, Madang Road, Yingshi Road, and Shaanxi South Road, where the terrain was lower and the water was deeper. The Drainage Department of the Public Works Bureau immediately ordered the staff of the Rihui Port, Huaian Road, Ye Jiazhai Road, and other pumping stations to continuously dredge and drain the water.</p>
<h3>The Seventh General Assembly of the City Council: Opening Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow Morning; Two Additional Proposals from Councilors Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>The seventh general assembly of the first Shanghai Municipal Council will hold its opening ceremony tomorrow at 9:00 AM and will immediately begin its first meeting. The secretariat of the assembly received two additional proposals from councilors yesterday, bringing the total to four. More than sixty councilors have registered. The two proposals received yesterday are as follows: (1) A proposal from Gu Baoyu, Pan Jiemei, and others: "It is proposed that the Economic Supervisor and the Municipal Authorities strictly crack down on illegal price increases in stores and vegetable markets to stabilize people's livelihoods." The three proposed measures are: 1. Send a letter to the Economic Supervisor and the Municipal Government to issue a notice allowing citizens to report as much as possible. 2. Order all police stations to send officers to investigate. Personnel who accept bribes or are corrupt will be severely punished. 3. If any store or vendor is found to be illegally increasing prices, they will be severely punished by being transferred to the court for sentencing, or their business license will be revoked. (2) A proposal from Baoyu and others: "It is proposed that the Central Government investigate the personnel who leaked the secret of selling the old Wing On Yarn shares and thoroughly investigate the figures behind them to maintain national law." The proposed method is: Petition the President to order the police and the Control Yuan to investigate the personnel who leaked the secret of selling Wing On Yarn shares and strictly investigate the figures behind them to prevent anyone from escaping justice.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Holds Thrifty Guidance Conference: Launches "Use National Products" Campaign; Bans the Manufacture of Extravagant Mooncakes; Restricts Consumption of Eggs and Peanuts</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau convened a thrift supervision meeting yesterday morning, inviting agencies such as the Police Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang. Chairman Wu Kaixian stated briefly: Shanghai is currently the most extravagant place. The wealthy and powerful indulge in extreme luxury. During this time of suppression and chaos, it is imperative to strengthen thrift. In the United States, the government stipulates that meat should not be eaten on Fridays. I hope that this can also be implemented in China. China has abundant production of eggs and peanuts. If we can conserve, we can transport them abroad and earn a lot of foreign exchange. Also, Chinese people eat too much beef, and many plowing oxen are killed, which is really a waste. In Britain, products that can earn foreign exchange cannot be bought in the country. This is something we should emulate. Subsequently, four resolutions were passed: (1) Launch a "Chinese People Use Chinese Goods" campaign, hoping that by next year, all Chinese people will wear Chinese cloth. (2) Stipulate the price of Mid-Autumn mooncakes, not to exceed five jiao per piece, and prohibit the manufacture of extravagant mooncakes. (3) Absolutely prohibit gift-giving during the Mid-Autumn Festival and actively launch campaigns to encourage people to save money from gift-giving to use for comforting the troops. (4) Investigate the actual production of eggs and peanuts and draft conservation measures.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Forbids Giving and Receiving Holiday Gifts: Discovery Leads to Dismissal</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to cooperate with the suppression and construction of the country and earnestly practice thrift, the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau recently issued an order to all subordinate units, admonishing police officers to absolutely prohibit giving and receiving gifts during the Mid-Autumn Festival. If this order is not followed, disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, will be taken upon discovery.</p>
<h3>Opium Discovered on the Yuanpei Wheel</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Yuanpei, the China Merchants Bureau's express liner on the northern route from Shanghai to Tianjin, returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the morning of the 6th and sheltered from the wind in Qingdao yesterday afternoon. According to a telegram from the ship's captain, Jin, at around 8:00 PM on the 6th, a cook, Hu Abao, found a paper package in the toilet at the stern of the ship and handed it over to the business director. It was discovered to be opium, but no one claimed it. The ship's captain requested the head office to send police officers from the police affairs group to inspect the ship upon arrival to clarify responsibility.</p>
<h3>Yu Shu, a Student at Tongji University, Requests the School to Accompany Him for Questioning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yu Shu, a freshman in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the College of Engineering of National Tongji University, was previously summoned by the Shanghai Special Criminal Court but failed to appear. The student recently sent a letter to the school, stating that his ambition is to study and that he has never been involved in external affairs or participated in student movements. He is being summoned now, and out of respect for national law, he is willing to appear in court for questioning and requests the school to send someone to accompany him to listen to the questioning. In order to ensure that government orders are consistent and that merchants and people can enjoy practical benefits, it is proposed that your department order the tax bureaus of all provinces and regions to immediately stop collecting any supplementary tax payments beyond six times the original amount. Those who have already paid to the treasury should be allowed to verify and offset the tax payments due for the first half of the 37th year of the Republic, so that the methods of collection and exemption are not inconsistent. At this time of financial consolidation, it can also encourage tax reporting.</p>
<h3>Embezzling Settlement Allowance for Lending at Interest: Prosecuting District Chief and Four Others</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Ye Zhenquan, the district chief of Penglai District in this city; Wang Naifeng, a clerk of the district office; Zhang Shijun, a district team leader; Yan Shouzhang, a cashier; and Ding Yanxiang, an assistant, were recently accused by residents of the district of embezzling settlement allowances after collecting them for this year's conscription. Instead of transferring them to the Civil Affairs Bureau, they used their positions for personal gain by lending them out at interest, which is suspected of being a group embezzlement. After several investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office, a public prosecution for embezzlement was filed against Ye and the other four.</p>
<h3>Not Intentionally Trying to Kill His Sister: Only Wanting to Make Her Aware; The Case of the Socialite Injured in the Buttocks Concludes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of the socialite Su Shanhu (originally named He Shouyu) being repeatedly threatened by her adoptive younger brothers, He Zhisong and He Zhixiong, and ultimately injured with a military knife, was previously prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office as attempted murder. The District Court concluded its hearing yesterday and scheduled sentencing for the 14th of this month. When Judge Zhang Yuanzhen of the District Court opened the hearing yesterday afternoon, He Zhisong and He Zhixiong were mentioned. Su Shanhu, who had recovered from her injuries, wore a blue cheongsam and was accompanied by her mother to court to answer questions. In court, she was asked why He Zhisong repeatedly threatened her with a gun and ultimately stabbed his sister. This nineteen-year-old, petite first defendant answered in broken Mandarin, with a cadence and rhythm that resembled reciting lines from a play. However, the meaning of his testimony showed that there were circumstances in this case beyond what the indictment stated, that "Shouyu and her two brothers had a deep rift." Zhisong testified: "I was very naughty when I was young. Later, I served as an apprentice sailor on a naval warship. Life at sea made me feel lonely. Year after year, I was far from home and received no comfort. My sister had a high status in society. I asked her to help me, but she was a person without feelings, so I hated her. I didn't want to kill her, I just wanted to make her aware and help others." The court nodded frequently upon hearing this testimony. The second defendant, He Zhixiong, originally Shouyu's cousin, strongly denied the allegation of conspiracy, claiming that it was Zhisong's doing and had nothing to do with him, and requested the court to declare him innocent. The debate then began. According to the allegations, the defendants were adopted as younger brothers by He Shouyu due to their poor circumstances. Because He Shouyu frequented social scenes and did not focus on household affairs, a deep rift developed between her and her two brothers. The defendants threatened Shouyu with a gun three times on May 29th, June 10th, and July 1st. Finally, on July 3rd, Zhisong stabbed Shouyu in the buttocks with a military knife. The two were arrested by the police and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution on charges of attempted murder.</p>
<h3>Traffic Safety Campaign to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>This city's annual Traffic Safety Promotion Week is scheduled from tomorrow to the 15th. The focus of this promotion week is the application of the new type of traffic lights. The Police Bureau will send a large number of police officers to patrol the streets and earnestly implement: (1) Cracking down on traffic violations, (2) Checking various vehicle licenses and driver's licenses, (3) Cracking down on empty taxis roaming, (4) Cracking down on irregular parking, (5) Cracking down on illegal street vendors, (6) Guiding pedestrians, etc. The Bureau will also strictly inspect the bicycle unions to prevent theft and effectively rectify long-distance traffic violations.</p>
<h3>National Bank Not Exchanging: Pounds and Rupees</h3>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Central Bank yesterday: The Central Bank is temporarily not accepting British pounds for exchange, the reason being that Britain prohibits the use of British pounds outside its group area, whether the Central Bank can exchange with Britain at the stipulated price after accepting exchange remains a question. The Central Bank is now asking the Ministry of Finance to decide on the detailed measures for British pound exchange. It is heard that it will be announced within days.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] According to the Jiangsu Postal Administration: After the currency reform, in order to cooperate with the new economic policies and facilitate the public in mailing items, the post office is rushing to print stamps with Gold Yuan face values to meet the demand. Before the new stamps are issued, the fees for all types of domestic mail will be temporarily accepted according to the originally set method. In addition, the declared value of registered letters and the insured value of insured letters, boxes, and packages will be expressed in Gold Yuan. The maximum declared value is temporarily changed to 20 Gold Yuan, and the maximum insured value is 60 Gold Yuan. The declared value and insurance fees will still be charged at the originally set rates.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Must Provide Chinese Translations: Otherwise, We May Not Accept Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In the past, when foreign nationals communicated with Chinese government agencies, they sometimes used their native languages, which was very inconvenient for the handling agencies. The Executive Yuan has recently stipulated that in the future, when foreign nationals communicate with Chinese central and local government agencies, if the agency deems it necessary to present a Chinese translation, it may order them to do so. Otherwise, the Chinese government may not accept it. In addition, if foreign consulates stationed in various parts of China communicate with local agencies using languages other than Chinese, the local agencies may, if necessary, consult with the consulates to submit Chinese translations.</p>

<h3>Gao Keng Coal Mine</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>This time, the opening of the Zhangshu-Zhuzhou section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway benefited from the assistance of Deputy Director Wang Yuankang of the Nanchang Office of the Railway Bureau and the efforts of Engineer Lin Yuesheng of the Nan-Chun Section Engineering Office, as well as the efforts of Chen Bangshu, the assistant manager of the Guanghan Xi Coal Bureau. Our reporter was able to quickly go west to Gao Keng, the only large coal mine in Jiangnan in the current stage. What I have observed will be recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanchang dispatch on the 4th] The history of Pingxiang Coal Mine dates back forty years, to March of the 24th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, when Zhang Zhidong and Sheng Xuanhuai jointly petitioned the Qing court for its establishment. At that time, the general manager of the coal mine was Zhang Zanchen, and the mining area was in Anyuan, about four kilometers from the county seat of Pingxiang County. The first total output was 10,000 tons. After the outbreak of the First World War, the output in the fifth year of the Republic of China reached 950,000 tons, which was the peak of coal production in the past forty years. According to the report of the Jiangxi Geological Survey Institute, the Pingxiang coal-producing areas include Anyuan and Gao Keng. The Anyuan area is the main part of this area</p>
<p>Main Body of Pingxiang Mine</p>
<p>Its scope starts from Anyuan, goes northeast through Baxianchong to Wangjiayuan, circles Zijia Chong, Tianzi Mountain to the south, passes through Xiaokeng Shuangfeng Chong, follows the Nanlu River to Wupoxie, and then follows the road from Wupoxie to Anyuan. The coal reserves in this area are few, after forty years of mining. Therefore, the Jiangxi Coal Mining Bureau has shifted its mining focus to Gao Keng.</p>
<p>The Gao Keng area is located southeast of Anyuan, its scope extending east from Baxian Chong, passing through Wangjiayuan, further northeast through Longjia Chong, Gao Keng, reaching Gaogangbu, then west from Gaogangbu, passing through Luanshi Ling, turning southwest through Yunjubu, Chahengli, Jiuliping, and reaching Anyuan.</p>
<p>The geological era of the Pingxiang coal-producing strata has been determined by successive geological surveys to belong to the Lower Jurassic of the Mesozoic Era. According to general survey results:</p>
<p>(1) Permian, (2) Triassic, (3) Jurassic, (4) Tertiary, (5) Quaternary.</p>
<p>Geological Structure</p>
<p>in the Pingxiang Coal area is extremely complex, and its relationship with the coal seam seems to be the closest with the Baipiao Pa orogenic movement. Therefore, the main geological structure of Pingxiang coal is a torsional fault. This fault trends roughly east-northeast to southwest, extending for about five kilometers. When the Pingxiang Mine was originally developed, when the main level tunnel reached the above boundary, it encountered rock layer fractures and once collapsed. After several twists and turns, it was penetrated, which is also sufficient evidence for the existence of the fault zone.</p>
<p>There are more than ten coal seams in the coal series in this area, the main ones being Peng Mine and Da Mine, which are very close to each other. The shale between them is less than half a meter, and some are separated by about two meters. The thickness of the two coal seams varies greatly, averaging about four meters. In Gao Keng, the thickness is about four meters, while in Xiaokeng to Huangkeng, the thickness varies. The secondary coal seams include Yijia Mine, Sanjia Mine, Yanzi Mine, Yingzi Mine, Magu Mine, and Saobian Mine.</p>
<p>According to the survey by the Coal Mining Bureau, the minable coal seams and thickness in the Gao Keng area are as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Minable Coal Seam Thickness in Gao Keng</p>
<p>Area Coal Seam Thickness</p>
<p>Gao Keng Yanzi Mine 1 to 1.6 meters</p>
<p>Yingzi Mine 0 to 1.3 meters</p>
<p>Peng Mine 0.2 to 1.4 meters</p>
<p>Da Mine 2 to 4.5 meters</p>
<p>Magu Mine 0.2 to 2.3 meters</p>
<p>The coal quality of Pingxiang Coal is very good, but in recent years, private earth pit miners have disregarded their reputation and mixed in rock chips and black soil, resulting in a sharp decline in the reputation of the coal. Now, the Jiangxi Coal Mining Bureau is working hard to improve and restore its past reputation. It is reported that the current Pingxiang Coal contains very little ash and only about 0.5% sulfur, making it suitable for coking. Magu Mine and Yijia Mine coal are harder, so there are more lumps. In the Zijia Chong area, lump coal accounts for 46%, while Da Mine coal is looser and lump coal accounts for about 10%.</p>
<p>According to the chemical analysis of Gao Keng coal entrusted by the Jiangxi Coal Mining Bureau to the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau on January 10 this year:</p>
<p>Chemical Analysis</p>
<p>is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Coal Seam Moisture Volatile Carbon Carbon Powder Sulfur BTU Thoughts of Military</p>
<p>Mixed Coal from the First Well 2.44 23.18 54.04 20.34 1.27 12065</p>
<p>Mixed Coal from the Third Well 2.19 23.44 58.60 15.77 0.8 12868</p>
<p>Mixed Coal from the Fourth Well 2.29 21.95 55.94 18.82 0.3 12207</p>
<p>According to the 1937 report of the Jiangxi Geological Survey Institute, the remaining coal reserves in the Pingxiang Mine area (Zijia Chong to Xiaokeng, and Anyuan to Huangkeng area) are 8,600,000 tons. According to the 1933 survey report by Zhu Qian et al. in the Gao Keng area (Gao Keng to Wangjiayuan area), the reserves are 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 tons. Recently, the Coal Mining Bureau estimated that the reserves in the Gao Keng area are about 63,000,000 tons based on geological surveys and drilling records. However, due to the complex geological changes in the Gao Keng area and the incomplete drilling work, the coal deposits near Gaogangbu are difficult to estimate. If there is sufficient exploration equipment to continue drilling, and if there is an extended coal field near Gaogangbu, then the total reserves will be more than this. Based on the current estimated reserves, assuming a mining efficiency of 80%, the coal production should be more than 50 million tons. If the annual production is 1.5 million tons, the coal reserves in the Gao Keng area can be mined for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Gao Keng Coal Mining</p>
<p>Currently, mechanical operations are not fully implemented. Instead, over 1,500 miners use their arms to dig out the coal from the bottom layer of the mine. The daily output is about 300 tons. However, the daily output of private earth pit mines in the Pingxiang Mine area should not be underestimated. Even considering the hand-pushed carts used to transport coal from the mining area to the city, nearly 20,000 of them travel on the coal road into the city every day, and the coal they push is entirely dug out by private earth pit mines.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Chongming Corn Leaving the Country</h3>
<p>[Report from our Chongming dispatch on the 6th] After the new corn came on the market, large quantities have been continuously exported from Nanmenbao Town through the two ports, with the number being quite large. The destinations are generally unknown. The general public believes that this year's harvest has been greatly reduced, and such large export will cause food safety concerns. The authorities have publicly stated: "The province only allows the free transportation and sale of food. For the sake of maintaining local food supply, the county stipulates that corn exported must be exchanged for rice to be brought back to Chongming."</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Fengxian Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>[Report from our Fengxian dispatch on the 5th] The two-year term of the first council of the County Chamber of Commerce has expired. The third county-wide representative assembly was convened on the 5th to elect half of the members by drawing lots, as per regulations. Sixty-some people including representatives of various industries and heads of branch offices attended. Section Chief Chen Shiliang of the County Government and Chiang Wen-shih representing the Party Headquarters were present to guide and supervise the election. As a result of the drawing of lots, six people including Fang Zanyao were removed, and six replacements including Bao Yongliang were elected. At the same time, the Chamber's constitution was amended to add two directors, and Liu De-dian was elected as the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce for the current term, with Wu Jincai and five others as standing members. The handover is scheduled for the 10th.</p>
<h3>Haining Tide</h3>
<p>Continues to Surge onto the Dike</p>
<p>Number of Special Train Viewers Increases Daily</p>
<p>[Report from our Haining dispatch on the 6th] This year, the sand outside the dikes in this county has completely collapsed, so the autumn tide is particularly large. Many pick-up dams have been continuously destroyed by the surge. The seawalls near Chenwengang to Qilimiaomiao are in disrepair, with the situation being critical. The Jue Zihao seawall outside the south gate of the town also shows signs of subsidence. The Dike Works Bureau is currently rushing to repair them. The annual tide-watching festival on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month is approaching. On that day, there will also be a spring tide. Each time the tide comes, it surges onto the dikes, creating a spectacular sight. Special trains from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places come every day, and the number of tide-watchers is gradually increasing. It is predicted that the grand occasion on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month will be unprecedented.</p>

<p>[Report from our Wuxi dispatch on the 7th] The Yimin Cocoon Firm in Xuewan was suddenly attacked by a large number of scattered bandits at 11 PM on the 7th. Twenty-six loads of dried cocoons were looted, resulting in a loss of more than 6,000 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Iron Tree Blooms in Haizhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Haizhou dispatch on the 1st] There is an iron tree planted in the Haizhou Enemy and Pseudo-Industry Liquidation Office on Zhengzhong Road in Xinpu.

Locals who came to view it thronged the road.</p>
<h3>Famous Soprano Vocalist Guan Yixuan in the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Binglin</p>
<p>[Report from our Dihua dispatch on the 5th] The nationally renowned soprano vocalist, Ms. Guan Yixuan, flew to Dihua on July 17th at the invitation of General Zhang Wenbai, Director of the Northwest Cultural Construction Association, and held three solo concerts. When she held a solo concert at the Soviet Consulate on the 24th, four broadcasting devices were specially installed in Peace Square, so that tens of thousands of people of all ethnic groups who love singing and dancing had a chance to listen. Deputy Consul Wu of the Soviet Consulate also praised Ms. Guan's artistic achievements. The Deputy Consul's wife also presented flowers to Ms. Guan on behalf of more than one hundred Soviet residents in Dihua. After Ms. Guan's three solo concerts ended, she leisurely toured the Tianchi Lake, which she had always longed for, and stayed for four days, returning from Tianchi only on the afternoon of the 29th.</p>
<p>Xinjiang Music Has Extremely High Talent</p>
<p>The Youth Song and Dance Troupe, which had previously performed Xinjiang songs and dances in Beijing and Shanghai, specially performed border ethnic songs and dances for Ms. Guan that night, dispersing only after 2 AM. When the reporter asked her to express her opinions on border songs and dances, she said excitedly: "Xinjiang's music is extremely cheerful and quite rhythmic. The talent for singing is also extremely high, but it is a pity that they have not used modern scientific methods for pronunciation and singing practice. However, this ethnic music can be spread and promoted to the Central Plains to stimulate the unity and joy of all ethnic groups..."</p>
<p>Secretary-General Liu Presented a Poem</p>
<p>She collected many folk songs in Xinjiang and asked Director He of the Translation Office of the Northwest Chief Executive's Office to translate them into Chinese. When Ms. Guan was about to fly east, Liu Mengchun, the Secretary-General of the Chief Executive's Office, wrote a poem entitled "A Trip to Tianchi": "The majestic energy flows from the west, the peaks of the Tianshan Mountains are always white-headed, a thousand peaks melt into ten thousand acres of gentleness, lush and green waves float like jade. Dense ancient pines pierce the sky, I whip my horse to the highest peak, the sky wind blows the song and the clouds collect it, the green mountains bow their heads and listen to the pure sound, the cypress water dresses as a dragon swims, the graceful posture merges with the immortals, this realm can be encountered but not sought. It is a pity that I could not stay for ten days, the bright moon in the long sky is full of emotion!"</p>
<p>When Ms. Guan flew east through the state of her jurisdiction, she discussed the matter of establishing a new art school with General Zhang Wenbai. She also hoped to introduce Xinjiang folk songs abroad.</p>
<p>A Letter from the Flower of the Uygur</p>
<p>Recently, Guan Yixuan had a letter sent from Wuhan to Ms. Kambalhan. The letter is extracted and recorded below:</p>
<p>"Ms. Kambalhan: I was extremely pleased and honored to meet you during my trip to the Northwest. While in Dihua, I was extremely touched that you and your husband visited the lodging several times! I am also grateful for the warm hospitality of your troupe's songs and dances. I will always cherish this precious friendship. I especially thank you and your husband and all the members of your troupe!</p>
<p>"I stayed in Minzhou for three days on my way. Director Zhang (referring to General Zhang Wenbai) expressed great concern for Xianyou and others, and inquired about everything in detail. I have already mentioned the matter of establishing an art school to Director Zhang. He has had this idea for a long time, but it is only a matter of funding. I sincerely hope that your plan can be realized soon! If Xinjiang's songs and dances can receive formal school training, there is no doubt that they can be further developed and promoted. I love their energetic, joyful, and enthusiastic emotions. If they can be widely developed, they will indeed be a precious elixir for the entire Chinese nation. I hope that the authorities will continue to promote them, and I hope that you will continue to lead Xinjiang's songs and dances to a bright future!</p>
<p>Go to North Platform Before Going to France</p>
<p>This spring, I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and plan to go to Europe to study and observe the music and art of various Western countries in the near future. I recently received a telegram from Paris inviting me to go to France in September, but I would like to hold concerts in Beiping and Taiwan before leaving the country, so I am afraid that I will not be able to go abroad on time. I would also like to collect more folk songs from various places so that I can introduce purely Chinese songs abroad. When I was in Dihua, I asked people to collect Xinjiang folk songs several times. According to a member of a certain troupe, several kinds of song scores had been handed over to Mr. He Guanggui for forwarding to me, but they have never been received, which I find very regrettable. Now I especially ask you to find a way to send me several Xinjiang folk songs. If you can translate the lyrics into Chinese, it will be even more welcome. I am very sorry for the trouble and thank you in advance!</p>
<p>"The weather in Wuhan is extremely hot and humid, which makes me miss the coolness of Dihua, and those sweet melons and fruits, especially those emotional and friendly people! There is also the snow on the Tianshan Mountains and the water in Yaochi (i.e., Tianchi), all of which are unforgettable! If there is another opportunity in the future, I would like to visit you again!..." Guan Yixuan respectfully.</p>
<h3>Island of Wind and Fire: Hong Kong Two or Three Things</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Zi Jian</p>
<p>[Report from our Hong Kong dispatch on the 4th] Old Hong Kong people say: Around the first day of the eighth lunar month, typhoons often strike Hong Kong. If there is a typhoon warning on the first day, then this typhoon is "extraordinary". On September 3 this year, which was clearly the first day of the eighth lunar month, the typhoon named "Gertrude" by American meteorologists was raging towards Hong Kong from the Philippines. Although the wind force was not very strong, traffic between Hong Kong and Kowloon was suspended for a morning and half an afternoon. People were still secretly rejoicing that this time it did not cause any disaster. However, disaster and the wind of the first day of the eighth lunar month seemed to have formed an historical and indissoluble bond with Hong Kong, but this time the disaster did not directly happen before the eyes of the general residents.</p>
<p>A Fast Train Causes a Tragedy</p>
<p>That afternoon, on a hillside more than 30 miles outside of Hong Kong, a fast train coming from Guangzhou was blown over by a gust of wind. Train derailments have almost lost their news value on the post-war railways, but batches of injured passengers were transported to Kowloon late at night, and the survivors painfully recounted the tragedy. The fourth carriage crashed into the third carriage, and then turned it over off the roadbed two feet high. According to the most conservative estimate, the number of deaths and injuries is at least 200 or more, which is not comparable to an ordinary train crash. As the reporter is writing, the railway bureau is still rushing to handle the aftermath and restore traffic, which is far from being realized. In addition to the typhoon, whether there were villains who deliberately removed the rail spikes in advance to sabotage the transportation artery between Guangdong and Hong Kong is currently under thorough investigation by the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Tibetan People Eke Out a Living</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Xu Renchang</p>
<p>[Report from our Ya'an dispatch on the 2nd] The spiritual sustenance of the religious life of the Kang and Tibetan people lies in the holy places and the Living Buddhas, but in political life, it is just the opposite. Kang and Tibet are both cold and barren places with few products. The people work hard all year round and still find it difficult to obtain enough to eat. If the government and officials do not oppress them, they can barely maintain themselves. If they want to impose excessive taxes and levies, they will suffer cold and hunger.</p>
<p>Power over Life and Death</p>
<p>The political and religious power of the Lhasa government still reaches the west bank of the Jinsha River, including its jurisdiction over more than a dozen counties in Xikang. In terms of religious power, it has sent countless monastic and secular officials to the counties in Tibet proper and on the east bank of the Jinsha River to be their pawns and implement strict political and religious control. For the affiliated counties on the east bank of the Jinsha River, it has sent countless senior lamas, who are permanently stationed in various temples, to be the highest rulers of each temple. Tibetan laws only have a dozen or so provisions in principle and no detailed articles. In the work of governing, the temporary joy and anger of the officials is the law. It is not necessary to have a legal basis for handling civil affairs. Therefore, this group of monastic and secular officials has supreme power over the people in their jurisdiction, and absolute freedom over life and death. They not only represent the government in collecting taxes, but also freely increase the amount of taxes and pocket them. All the necessities of their daily life are taken from the people, from trivial matters such as firewood, grass, tea, and water, to onerous demands such as sexual needs, all of which are ordered by the people to provide. In addition to the actual consumption by them and their family members and servants, they also set up various kinds of names and collect cash, which is transported back to their hometowns for storage. In the event of disputes among the people, it goes without saying that officials openly solicit bribes to resolve them. Even if they want to see an official, they must first pay enough kowtow money. If the bribe is not as generous as that of the other party, then they may be beaten to death in court, or have their hands cut off and their eyes dug out, or be dismembered and fed to dogs, or burned in fire and water, which depends on the joy and anger of the officials at the time. There is no fixed standard. At the lightest, they will not die tragically, but their property will always be unable to be preserved. As for the lamas stationed in temples in the counties on the east bank of the Jinsha River, although their power is not as great as that of the monastic and secular officials in the west bank, they live off the land. Their lives are still taken from the local people, but the methods of extraction used are slightly different.</p>
<p>Methods of Resistance</p>
<p>The lives of the Kang and Tibetan people are already difficult, and it is difficult for them to be self-sufficient. In addition, the insatiable plunder of officials and lamas makes it impossible for them to breathe. Grievances accumulate deep in their hearts, and they have never dared to express positive resistance. In this situation of deep hatred but not daring to actively resist, two passive forms of resistance naturally arise:</p>
<p>First, they ask the Bodhisattva to call them to die early so that they can escape the pain of reality and be reborn into the Western Pure Land they long for.</p>
<p>Second, if they encounter a possible opportunity, they will leave their homes and flee into the areas under the jurisdiction of Han officials, to find another place to live. Whether they can die early cannot be arranged by human power, so the second method is available to them at any time. However, the punishments of the Tibetan officials are extremely cruel and their greed is especially great, because they also have to take money to pay homage to their superiors. If they are chased back halfway, they can forget about living, and their property will not be preserved. Even if they have already fled to the area under the jurisdiction of Han officials, they will try every means to capture them back, and they will suffer the same tragic situation of family ruin and death. They have a common saying: "The best Tibetan official is not as good as the worst Han official."</p>
<p>Preventing Inward Orientation</p>
<p>In the past, Tibet had a philosophy that made a prophecy and revelation to the people: "In the future, our savior will come from the East." This sentence is firmly remembered in the minds of their people, and they are waiting for this savior from the East to come soon. Now that they are actually seeing the different styles of the Han and Tibetan governments and the officials they have sent, it further confirms the value of this prophecy and strengthens their inward psychology. They welcome the Han officials and are happy to see the majesty of the Han officials. However, the Tibetan officials and lamas know this situation well and know that it is quite dangerous for themselves. They always deliberately spread rumors to attack the Han officials to prevent the people from admiring the inland.</p>
<p>Modern Marvels All Rights Reserved</p>
<p>There is always a lot of news in Hong Kong in September. On Journalists' Day, more than half of the colleagues not only slept less, but did not even have the time to sit down and drink a glass of wine to celebrate "their own holiday."</p>
<h3>Eleven Smugglers Are Very Daring</h3>
<p>At about 2 AM one morning, Hong Kong Customs happily called each newspapers, saying that they had seized a batch of smuggled goods worth more than one million yuan, as well as a brand-new smuggling ship. Hearing the news, the reporter got out of bed, with sleepy eyes, and ran to the stone pier in front of the Customs. According to the customs officers: These eleven smugglers are very daring. They loaded the smuggled goods on the quiet sea behind Hong Kong, and even went to a nearby fish and seafood restaurant to have a drink. Just as they were drinking and having fun, the customs officers flew over and towed away the armed barge loaded with smuggled goods, and sent a large number of police officers to surround and capture the smugglers on the nearby coast. As a result, they all fell into the net one by one. This is a glorious victory in the anti-smuggling war. The reporter accompanied the customs people in their joy, and after coming back to write the manuscript, the sky was already bright.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong People "Turn Pale at the Mention of Fire"</h3>
<p>One evening, the reporters were sitting down for a drink when they suddenly saw a plume of black smoke rising from the seaside. The fire department reported that the naval dockyard was on fire. "Forgetting self for the public good," some people put down their glasses and rushed to the destination. It turned out that the fire was only burning a corner of the naval dockyard. The fire god had visited a warehouse full of medical supplies. The lost medicines were worth 800,000 yuan in total, among which a large number of "Ruyi Bags" were stored!</p>
<p>In the past ten days, Hong Kong people have been "turning pale at the mention of fire." On the 23rd of last month, 300 barrels of caustic soda in the Kowloon Warehouse on the opposite shore caused a four-hour fire, burning goods (mostly foreign paper and chemical raw materials) covering an area of 24,000 square feet and worth seven or eight million yuan to ashes. Several post-war nouveau riche were also "restored" because of this fire. People "watched the fire from across the shore." The flames flew tens of feet high, which was shocking and unforgettable.</p>
<h3>Destroying Finance Reaps Bitter Fruit</h3>
<p>It seems as if the heavens are deliberately playing a joke on journalists. Just the other day, there was a sensational piece of news in Hong Kong: Wing Shing Bank, a financial institution with a considerable reputation in the Hong Kong and China financial circles, closed down due to failed gold speculation. It is said that its owner, Mr. He, has always distrusted domestic currency. On the eve of the issuance of the Gold Yuan, amidst the great fluctuations in domestic finance, he purchased 50,000 taels of gold futures. On that day, the market price per tael rose sharply from 320 yuan to over 330 yuan. Mr. He made a profit of more than 500,000 yuan out of thin air, which made him extremely complacent. Unexpectedly, after the issuance of the Gold Yuan, the price of gold plummeted, with a difference of more than 50 yuan per tael before and after. When Mr. He saw the price of gold fall to 300 yuan, he still insisted on his distrust of domestic currency and refused to sell. When the price of gold "collapsed and became hopeless," Mr. He was ruined and closed the doors, fleeing in a hurry. Mr. He lost approximately two million yuan in this venture. This is a latest example of deliberately undermining finance and reaping the bitter fruit.</p>

<h3>Important Resolutions of the Materials Adjustment Committee: Southern Transport of Taiwan Sugar Prohibited Immediately; Export Licenses for Cotton Cloth to Be Handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee of the Executive Yuan's Economic Control Commission held its second meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM in the National Bank conference room. Chairman Liu Gongyun, Vice-Chairman Li Lixia, Committee Members Lin Chongyong, Zhang Sunlan, Shen Xirui, Jiang Biao, Yang Chuo'an, Wang Ziseng, Shu Yunzhang, Shen Zhennan, Zhang Xiwei, and He Molin, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jianhua, and Chief Secretary Chen Shuzeng were in attendance.</p>
<p>First, Chairman Liu Gongyun reported on the National Bank's entrusted sale of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the joint sale of surplus materials by the Materials Supply Bureau and the National Bank, and the sale of enemy and puppet materials by the China Trust Bureau. The following important matters were resolved:</p>
<p>(1) The transport of food oil to the north is not restricted. (2) The transport of Taiwan sugar to the south is prohibited immediately. (3) The issuance of licenses for the transport of cotton cloth to the south will be handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. (4) The Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Association's application for the allocation of raw silk to maintain production will be handled by the China Trust Bureau, which will sell 500 dan at the limited price first, and then gradually allocate more. (5) Regarding the supply of raw cotton to cotton mills in the next quarter of this year, it was decided that the national and private cotton mills should first draft a plan and submit it for discussion at the next meeting. (6) The large amount of Japanese wool stored by the China Trust Bureau will be sold off in batches soon.</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman emphasized the importance of the committee's role in materials adjustment and the close attention of the authorities. For example, Ho Hao-jo has been assigned to be responsible for the accelerated processing of enemy and puppet industries in order to quickly complete this long-pending and complicated work. At the same time, he hoped that the relevant agencies would cooperate closely to truly achieve the effect of overall materials adjustment.</p>
<p>[Also, News] The main materials adjusted by the Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee include the following five items: (1) Cooking oil, (2) Food grains, (3) Cotton yarn and cloth, (4) Sugar, (5) Fuel.</p>
<p>[Also, News] According to a person in charge of the committee, the first batch of US-aid cotton will be cleared through customs soon, and it is expected to be able to produce 60,000 bales of yarn, which will be allocated half for domestic sales and half for export.</p>
<p>[Also, News] The sugar market softened slightly yesterday because the He Sugar Company distributed coarse sugar again. The coarse sugar warehouse receipts fell to 28 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen. Spot goods also fell slightly to 29 yuan and 2 jiao. The sales of white sugar in hemp bags were limited. 40 bags of green sugar were offered at the limited price to regular dealers.</p>
<h3>Shenxin and Other Factories Sell on the Market; Abundant Supply of Cotton Yarn; Hot Trading in Cloth; Prices Decline Again</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation yesterday was such that, because Zhongfang (China Textile Industries Corporation), Shenxin, and other factories opened for sale in the market, the supply of yarn suddenly turned abundant. Within the price limits, both local and outside buyers were strong. The activity of the trading was unprecedented since the "August 19th" incident. However, because Longtou fine cloth fell below the limited price, there were not many new buyers. Re-manufacturing industries in the market directly purchased yarn from the cotton mills, so there was very little trading in fine yarn. The Fangjian Company continued to offer 20-count Lotus Heart, Red Bee, Clock Star, and Red Kuixing, all priced at 707 yuan. A total of 235 bales of coarse and fine yarn of various brands were traded, 109 bales more than the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, news: Zhongfang Company offered 30 bales of 10-count Golden Treasure Star at a price of 600 yuan. The Shenxin Cotton Mill sold a large quantity on the market through the Cotton Yarn Merchants Association. The day before yesterday, 250 bales of yarn were to be offered, and 125 applicants requested to purchase 169 bales. Today, 222 bales were to be allocated, plus the 81 bales remaining from the previous day, for a total of 303 bales available for allocation today.</p>
<p>Also, news: The Zhongfang Business Department issued a public notice on the 19th of last month stating that any customer of the company who had borrowed tube yarn should pay off their debts within the specified time, otherwise the allocation of yarn would be temporarily suspended. The deadline has now passed, and many of the notified customers have not yet paid. The company has issued another public notice stating that, starting today, the allocation will be temporarily suspended for those who have not paid. Among these customers, 5 belong to Factory No. 12, 4 belong to Factory No. 17, and 10 belong to Factory No. 2.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market situation yesterday was that, after the chairman of the industry association advocated selling off, many others followed suit, and trading in the market became even more lively. Most long positions were closed, and many in the industry also sold off. Northern merchants, such as Tongyuan Yong, also came to resell, and the supply became smooth. The buyers were all storehouses, such as Xinda Xiang and Xie Da Xiang, who took the opportunity to absorb supplies to meet market sales. After Longtou fine cloth opened at 29 yuan and 4 jiao, Yongxin Company came to sell off again, causing the price of Longtou fine cloth to fall by another jiao to 29 yuan and 3 jiao. There were many trades at the limited price for other cloths such as Wufu, Laba Tong, Yanghe, and fine cloth.</p>
<p>Also, news: The Fangjian Company routinely allocated 14 kinds of fabrics, including Wufu B fine cloth, Taoyuan Tu fine cloth, Wanshan bleached cloth, Yuan Biji, and bed sheets. The demand was greater for Wufu B fine cloth.</p>
<p>Zhongfang Cotton Yarn Transported to Shenyang for Sale</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] The Northeast Branch of Zhongfang transported 200 bales of cotton yarn from Jinzhou to Shenyang by air yesterday. A total of 1,600 bales will be transported in succession. A portion will be sold off to the market to stabilize yarn prices. The Jinzhou Branch of Zhongfang has 60,000 spindles, but due to insufficient electricity and raw materials, only 10,000 spindles are operating, producing 15 bales of cotton yarn per day.</p>
<h3>Money Market Stable; Exchange Rates in Guangzhou and Xiamen Raised Again</h3>
<p>The money market yesterday still showed stability. There was a large flow of idle capital southward, and the market needed more orders. However, because there were few trades in the market, and industrial and commercial orders were scarce, the underground interest rate fell by about one jiao. Although the national banks continued to inject money, bank deposits increased, and there was no sign of tightness in the money market. Also, news: The flow of idle capital to the south has become even more turbulent in recent days. Commercial banks in this city have raised the exchange rates for Guangzhou and Xiamen again, charging about 80 yuan or more per 1,000 yuan. Gold Yuan notes with a face value of 50 yuan have been issued since yesterday, and gangs are searching and confiscating them to transport them south in order to avoid the authorities' attention and save on exchange fees.</p>
<p>Seeing that the outflow of idle capital to the south was intensifying, the government decided to restore restrictions on remittances. The Ministry of Finance is currently deliberating on the permissible amount of Gold Yuan notes that can be freely transported domestically, and the announcement is pending.</p>
<h3>Export Tea Stable and Popular</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] According to an authoritative figure in tea exports, after our government reformed the currency system, the Export Control Committee announced the minimum FOB (Free on Board, Shanghai) price for export materials. Therefore, most export materials are gradually gaining momentum in the international market, and exporters are pleased. The tea industry, in particular, is becoming more promising. Unfortunately, due to the exhaustion of production stocks and the sharp increase in production prices, trading in Japanese and Western tea markets is very scarce, but the underlying trend is quite stable and popular. As for domestic sales, various floral varieties have their ups and downs, and the process has not seen significant fluctuations.</p>
<p>It is also learned that this year's Keemun black tea is being continuously shipped in batches by the Anhui Tea Company, totaling 314 boxes. It is said that they plan to distribute samples for sale soon.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Price Quotations for Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>In recent days, the prices of woolen fabrics have suddenly become erratic. On the surface, wholesale and retail prices are the same, and retail sales are only for a few social interactions, and wholesale business has decreased. In reality, however, wholesale prices at tea parties are higher than retail prices, and the factory price quotations are higher than the prices quoted in the market. The Zhongfang price quotations have remained unchanged at the limited price, so the market prices have not been able to rise above the level. However, various goods such as flannel, Biji, and overcoating, which are in season, are mostly unavailable, resulting in chaotic price quotations. When Zhongfang woolen fabrics were available, the difference between the market price and the retail price was only about 5 jiao. Currently, because they are not available, the difference has risen to between 2 and 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported Paper Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Panama-registered vessel "Aktau," managed by Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday, carrying 6,417 pieces of paper from Sakhalin Port on Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Union. It is currently berthed at the Swire Group's Huatong Wharf for unloading.</p>

<h3>Quiet Trading Due to Rain; Rice Prices Continue to Decline; Market in Shantou Tentative and Scarce Trading</h3>
<p>The rice market is sluggish. Due to heavy rain, there were few pedestrians on the market, resulting in very quiet trading. Because households have already received their rationed rice, there were very few who came to the market to buy more, and there was no active outlet. The opening prices were the same as the previous day, but the market saw a decline due to poor sales, although most prices remained at the original price from the previous day. Indica rice saw a slight drop of 4 or 5 jiao. High-quality rough indica rice, including bags, was 16 yuan, and Jiaxing new rough indica rice was 15 yuan and 5 jiao, a decrease of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Yesterday's arrivals were 2,259 shi in the South Market and 1,912 shi in the North Market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Turned firm and high. The prices of various flours increased slightly yesterday. Because the delivery period for warehouse receipts has expired, there are fewer sellers. In addition, the factories have not offered any goods for several days, so the market has turned firm. However, there was very little trading, and actual sales were not large. The price of Bingshen flour was only 7 yuan, 2 jiao, 4 fen, and 1 li, an increase of 1 jiao and 1 fen compared to the previous day. The price of Lao Che flour rose slightly by 5 fen, and the sale was slow. The price of Hongfeng rose by 5 fen, and the price of Jiancheng rose by 9 fen. Other miscellaneous brands of flour also saw a slight increase. Wheat bran remained at the limited price.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The market was stable, and trading gradually increased. Soybean oil factories purchased a lot of vehicle beans and Zha beans, and the price remained at the limited price. Northern merchants purchased corn as usual, and supply and demand were both high, so the market was also stable. Red sorghum rose by 2 jiao, and there was an outlet for buyers. Broad beans were average. Dried beans were in short supply and were not offered for sale. The price of Yuanmai was similar to the previous day, but there was very little trading. Sesame was offered at the limited price. Raw peanuts had an outlet in the interior. Dawan Kou raw peanuts were 33 yuan, and many were offered for sale.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The market was tentative, and trading was very quiet yesterday, with almost no price fluctuations. Datong Factory and other factories offered soybean oil, and the price was 49 yuan and 7 jiao. Spot goods were all within 50 yuan. The price of Tongfeng soybean oil was 49 yuan, and the market was said to be stable. The price of raw oil remained at the limit. 40 to 50 barrels of pure raw oil were offered at a price of 59.90 yuan. There was no trading in Jitong small cars, and sesame oil in old-barrel small cars was offered at the limited price of 52 yuan and 5 jiao. Rapeseed oil alone saw an increase of 5 jiao, opening at 46 yuan. The sale of soybean cake to buyers was quiet. The factory price was mostly 4 yuan and 6 jiao, and bulk cargo was 2 fen lower.</p>
<h3>Timber Price Limits Approved</h3>
<p>The timber price limits have been formally approved by the competent authority of the association. Starting yesterday, the price list will be distributed to the industry for compliance. Regarding the approved price limits, foreign pine, regardless of square or flat, is 5 jiao and 7 fen per foot. Small cedar strips are 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li, and pine slices are 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 7 li. The rest are mostly similar to the prices offered in the previous few days. Only pine planks sawn square are 4 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen per zhang, and tanhu planks are 2 yuan and 5 jiao, both of which are ordinary goods. The price limits for Hongxing and Shuangqian brands are higher, at 5 yuan and 2 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen, respectively. Also, yesterday large cedar strips were at the limited price of 1 jiao and 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Cigarette and Soap Market Declines</h3>
<p>Various cigarette manufacturers, such as Dadongnan, Huamei, and Huaming, have universally distributed goods to large and small peers in Shanghai. At the same time, Yongtaihe notified a large number of A, B, and C peers in the port to distribute goods, so the money market in the industry is gradually tightening. Many cigarettes are being sold at the limit price.</p>
<p>China Xiangmao Company also distributed a huge amount of soap. After hearing the news, the peers and retail scattered sell off, and each soap fell to limit prices. Gu Ben soap sells 26 yuan and 5 jiao, Xiangmao soap sold for 20 yuan, zero jiao, and 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Autumn Cocoons Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>This year's Wuxi autumn cocoons are very few. Silkworm farmers are asking for 18 shi of rice in exchange for one dan of dry cocoons. According to the local rice price of 18 yuan per shi, each dan of dry cocoons requires 324 Gold Yuan.</p>
<h3>Solving the Coal Shortage in the Beijing-Shanghai Area; Fuel Management Committee Plans to Increase Coal Sources; Estimated Monthly Increase to 270,000 Tons</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with the economic emergency decree, the Fuel Management Committee has formulated a plan for the supply of coal in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The most important aspect of the plan is how to increase coal sources. The committee has formulated six measures:</p>
<p>(1) Assist in restoring the double track of the Tangyu section of the Beining Railway, (2) Prepare to transfer Luan coal through the new port of Tanggu (3) Encourage the export of Taiwan coal, (4) Enhance the transportation capacity of the Jinpu Railway, (5) Solve the difficulties of coal ships, (6) Reward manufacturers for transporting bituminous coal themselves.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the above measures can increase the coal source by 270,000 tons per month. Of these, 100,000 tons are from the Huadong and Huainan mines, 50,000 tons are from Taiwan, and 120,000 tons are from Kailuan. The Beijing-Shanghai area is allocated 220,000 tons per month, leaving 50,000 tons in reserve. The current coal situation is difficult, but it will be overcome soon. The committee is about to end, and a new institution is being prepared. It has been named the Bituminous Coal Adjustment and Supply Office and is responsible for the supply of coal in the Beijing-Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Also, news: Another ship of foreign coal (white coal) will be imported. The ship is the "Lingyun," which belongs to the China Shipping Company, and it is carrying 7,452 tons of white coal from Hong Ji, Vietnam. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th of this month to supply the market. The quantity of coal briquettes to be allocated and sold in Shanghai in September will be more than sufficient. Also, the Tai'an and Dasheng ships, carrying 11,000 tons of beach coal from Qinhuangdao, will arrive in Shanghai on the 3rd.</p>

<h3>Guizhou University Faculty Association Cables to Request Adjustment of Public Education Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Guiyang, 7th] The Faculty Association of National Guizhou University cabled on the 6th to all university faculty associations across the country, requesting them to jointly make three demands to President Chiang and relevant ministries: (1) (2) Change the base salary for public education personnel to 100 yuan.

<h3>Representatives of the Beijing Professors' Association Go to Various Yuan and Departments to Request Adjustments to Public Education Compensation, Personally Delivering Written Opinions and Presenting Three Requests</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Representatives from the Professors' Associations of various national colleges and universities in the capital, in order to request adjustments to the compensation of public education personnel nationwide and academic research subsidies for professors, visited the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Ministry of Education, and the Tenth Planning Department, Ministry of Finance, and other agencies on the 6th and 7th, personally delivering written opinions. The heads of various Yuan and Departments received them and expressed sympathy for the requests of the representatives of the professors' associations of various schools, promising to consider them. The said written opinion is as follows: "The government's reform of the currency system is intended to restore the currency value and prices to pre-war levels, a noble intention. However, according to the government's newly promulgated measures for the payment of public education personnel, the salary conversion is far from the actual price level. Numerically, the ratio is approximately one to ten. It will be increasingly difficult for colleagues to maintain their livelihoods hereafter, and it is difficult to remain silent on this matter. Therefore, representatives of the professors' associations of various national colleges and universities in the capital convened a joint meeting. Based on the various principles of the government's recently promulgated Emergency Financial and Economic Measures and taking into account the actual living needs of public education personnel, three points were decided: (Omitted in the middle, details were on page 7 of this newspaper on September 1st.) The proposals are not extravagant, and in light of the circumstances, they are fair and practical. We sincerely hope that the government will adopt them to comfort the public."</p>

<h3>American Military Baseball League: China Declines Sharply; Women's Softball League: Lantern Falls to Second Place</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The nation's hopes for running and hitting in baseball have vanished with the scattering of China's athletes and the repeated defeats of Lantern. Most of China's veterans are tired and have been replaced by new Panda blood. Their ball skills and experience are inevitably inferior. Therefore, in the second American Naval Baseball League, they have repeatedly lost and no longer have the strength to seriously threaten the Air Force, the champion team of the first season. The second league has entered the second cycle. The Air Force, with the reputation of the defending champion, sits atop the league with seven wins and one loss in eight games. Helena is second with four wins and two losses. Amateur is third with five wins and three losses. China has made six expeditions to Qishan and only won once, ranking seventh. Now that the summer vacation has passed and the schools are about to start, the Panda athletes are mostly young students, and it will be even more difficult to concentrate on this field. The seat in the yellow bag is not easy to break free. Here is the latest situation in the second baseball league:</p>
<p>Team Name Games Wins Losses Percentage</p>
<p>Air Force 8 7 1 .857</p>
<p>Helena 6 4 2 .667</p>
<p>Amateur 8 5 3 .625</p>
<p>Nanjing 12 6 6 .500</p>
<p>Army 10 5 5 .500</p>
<p>Navy 12 2 8 .200</p>
<p>China 6 1 5 .167</p>
<p>In the Women's Softball League organized by the International Sports Association, Lantern was unfortunately defeated by the Education Federation by one point in the first cycle. Then, due to a moment of underestimation, it was swallowed by the Raccoon. The hope of avenging in the second cycle and sharing the championship with the Education Federation was also lost. As a result, morale declined, and when they met the Education Federation again, they were completely defeated. Now the Education Federation has gloriously ascended to the throne with a record of 16 consecutive victories. Lantern still has several makeup games, and the second place should not be a problem. In addition, in order to celebrate the successful conclusion of various ball games, the International Sports Association has arranged several closing performance matches, with the "Wives," "Misses," and "Students" teams participating in the competition. This Sunday afternoon at 4 pm, the "Misses" will face off against the "Students."</p>
<h3>Public Tennis Tournament: Matches Suspended Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Resuming on Friday</p>
<p>The incessant autumn rain has again interrupted the public tennis tournament, causing the matches to be unable to proceed in order, which has greatly affected the efficiency and competitive spirit. Moreover, after the heavy rain, the red and yellow sand on the court has been washed away and needs to be tidied up. The Tennis Committee Office stated that matches will be suspended today and tomorrow, regardless of the weather. If the weather clears up immediately, the matches will resume from Friday (10th), and the schedule will be rearranged and announced.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the office, the weather was sunny and warm during the first week of the public tournament, and the matches proceeded smoothly. Since then, there have been continuous heavy rains, which have prevented the scheduled plan from being completed. The Tennis Committee, in view of the completion of the Youth Tennis Association, which has established a relatively perfect ball court, and in order to increase the interest of the tennis community in the city and achieve the effect of popularizing progress, has specially held all the matches of the public tournament at the association's ball court. The committee does not hesitate to sacrifice and provide all the balls for the matches. The budget for the expenses when the public tournament started registration was 5 billion yuan in legal tender, but according to the estimate when the currency system was reformed on August 19, it will require 7.5 billion, equivalent to 2,500 gold yuan. This is due to the sharp increase in the index in the first half of August. The committee has obviously encountered major difficulties, but it is determined to overcome them.</p>
<h3>The Davis Cup Is Decided by Individual Matches; America Wins 5-0</h3>

The association has hired Shan Xiaoben, Gu Luoyi, Jiang Xiaoshi, Zhu Xiguang, Wu Daquan, Gu Shengyao, Zhu Xuejing and other seven people to form a competition committee to preside over the event.

<h3>Managers of Various Tennis Clubs in This City Initiate Professional Tennis Tournament; Registration Begins Immediately, Deadline on the 12th</h3>
<p>The managers (commonly known as "caddies") of various tennis clubs in this city all have excellent ball skills. Their work is no different from the nanny of amateur tennis players. Recently, they initiated the organization of a fellowship association to seek group welfare and support future generations. They also initiated a city-wide open professional tennis competition. Registration is now open, with a deadline of the 12th of this month. Registration can be made with Zhao Xiaodi at the Youth Tennis Association, or at other clubs. A deposit of one gold yuan for singles and two yuan for doubles must be paid upon registration and will be refunded after the competition. Forfeiture once will result in confiscation. The competition will be held in a best-of-three format, while the semi-finals and finals will be held in a best-of-five format. The competition venues will be held at the Guangming Club on Xiaoshadu Road and the Zhangyuan Club on Linsen Middle Road, while the semi-finals and finals will be held at the Youth Tennis Association on Huashan Road. In the past, professional player competitions were initiated by Kavanagh and others, but they have been suspended for nearly ten years. The continuation of this initiative will have a good impact on both professional and amateur tennis circles. Those who are in charge of it are Zhou Rixin (Hardoon Garden), Qiu Zilong (Guangming), Dai Mingfa (Spire), Zhao Shutian (Green Light), Zhang Xiaolong (United States), Wu Shengkang (Rong House), Zhao Xiaodi (Youth), Xu Xingzhi (Friends Union), Hang Kebao (Jinlan), Bai Weiyuan (Sports), Qian Wenbao (Citibank General Assembly), Zhang Qiaosheng (Slanting Bridge General Assembly), Yan Xingbao (Chinese Association), Yan Guilin (Sports General Assembly), etc.</p>

<h3>Yingxiutang Cricket Fighting</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Today is the White Dew Festival, and the annual cricket fighting season has arrived again. People in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who enjoy playing with autumn insects regard it as a major event. There are experts who raise them, and famous masters who hold the grass. After the White Dew Festival, the autumn season (gambling term) begins. Famous towns and cities along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines hold them in stages. The final victor is called the Invincible General. Among my friends, some enjoy this way, and I occasionally admire their insects, but I have not participated in their fights.</p>
<p>Before the Republic, when I was studying in the old capital, I once participated in a cricket fighting event at Yingxiutang with my brother and friends. Yingxiutang was located at No. 1 Dawailangying, outside Qianmen in the old capital, and was the residence of Tan Xinpei, the king of the opera world. Several of us were Tan (Tan) fans, and Lao Tan was also from Hubei. Because of our shared hometown and hobbies, we often visited his insect gatherings every autumn. On the day of the Yingxiutang cricket fight, those who brought insects included nobles, officials, merchants, and various opera performers. The insects must be matched in pairs, with each gram and ounce exactly the same, before they can enter the enclosure. The person in charge of this task was an old man (i.e., a eunuch), who used the scales used in silver shops to weigh each insect's weight. It had to be extremely even without the slightest difference, and then they were divided and opened. Xinpei often came out of the inner house to watch when the two insects were about to enter the basin.</p>
<p>One day, Xinpei obtained a "Guangyi" (a type of cricket) and happily showed it to us. On that day, the place to sell crickets in the old capital was in the shops outside Shunzhimen (i.e., Xuanwumen). A small basket of crickets, about dozens of heads, could be bought for two taels of silver, and there were often excellent ones among them. My history and brother bought a basket at Wanshun Old Store and carefully selected it. Among them was a "Guangyi" with a large head and long feet, which seemed to be an English material. We discussed with Xinpei to choose a day to try fighting it, not inviting many people. Those who came on time, besides the Yingxiutang family, only included my brothers and friends, about a dozen people in total. The old man weighed the "Guangyi" weight, and Tan's insect was about a li weaker than my brother's. Wei Pei asked what to do? My brother was not interested in flowers (flowers are the name of the bets placed on both sides during insect fighting), but only wanted to enjoy the insect's struggle to get a laugh. Therefore, although the weight of the B insect was slightly lighter than Tan's insect, he was still willing to put it in the basin to see what would happen. After opening the machine, the grass holder slightly moved it, and the long beards of the two insects touched each other. They immediately pounced forward, their teeth biting each other, fighting fiercely, and the scene was extremely tragic. My brother's insect suddenly changed its strategy and bit its enemy's leg. Xinpei watched from the sidelines and shouted, "It bit my thigh!" The viewers all laughed. In a blink of an eye, the victory or defeat was decided. My brother's insect crowed loudly, its voice clear and melodious, and Tan's insect retreated and fled.</p>
<p>There was also a ridiculous thing this time. Yang Shiqi, the brother of Yang Shixiang, the Beiyang Minister and Governor-General of Zhili, was among those who came to watch that day. When the two "Guangyi" were fighting fiercely, he concentrated his attention, looked down at the fighting basin, and rested his hands on the edge of the table. My younger brother Nongxian was beside him, also looking down. Suddenly, a thick stream of nasal mucus fell on Shiqi's back. Shiqi was watching the insect fight and did not pay attention to it, showing a noble tolerance, which was admirable and laughable.</p>

<p>Although it is already autumn, small fans have not yet been discarded. When friends meet, they often look at each other's fans; either criticizing the writing as good, or criticizing the painting as not good. This has become commonplace.</p>
<p>That day, Friend A invited me to visit Friend B together. While they were talking vigorously, I took Friend A's fan to take a look. It was all made by daytime artisans. The writing was not bad, but upon closer inspection, I saw that it was written:</p>
<p>"The Calligrapher Wang's brushwork can melt 'govern' (originally written like this) the various Yan and Liu masters, so the goodness of his calligraphy is truly difficult for the ancients to match! And Wen Min's rise hundreds of years later and ability to obtain his spirit is truly difficult to find in the area, so his brushwork..."</p>
<p>The rest of the text is unknown. The signature is in the name of someone from Suzhou. Because this is a rare and wonderful article to read, it must be recorded, but unfortunately the tone is incomplete!</p>
<p>The next day, Friend A invited us for a small drink at his residence. I met Friend B and took his fan to look at. I won't talk about the writing, the painting was "Ten Thousand Bamboos in Misty Rain," but the bamboos didn't look like bamboos but like a belt. Upon another look at the inscription, it was written:</p>
<p>"In the style (originally written like this) of the Calligrapher Wang to dedicate to Mr. ××!"</p>
<p>The signature is Seventy-two Old ××. This is another wonderful article that must be recorded.</p>
<p>What I saw in two days can be called amazing. After the wine, I laughed and advised them to combine the two pieces of writing and painting to form a pair of gems, becoming "Two Calligrapher Wangs"! They didn't understand. After I explained it, they also laughed.</p>
<h3>Spring View of Beihu Lake</h3>
<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Where is the scenery most pitiful? The spring in Beihu is soft, and the waves are like smoke. Tourists invite dreams outside the slanting sun, and maids search for songs beside short boats. The flower clouds in the distance are all affectionate, and the flying willow mist is always graceful. Even more affectionate are the red flowers, the same fragrance reaching the silken banquet.</p>
<p>The beautiful silken banquet is reopened, and the spring water and spring mountains are embroidered into a pile. The beautiful scenery is just beginning to dazzle, and the shocking war flames make me hesitate to linger. Swallows carrying mud plan to nest in jeweled trees, and ants carrying soil compete to embrace giant locusts. I only beg for steady feet to soar into the sky, and a short stay by the flowers is like Penglai.</p>
<h3>Signing and Stamping</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>Now there are many documents, such as guarantees, or some forms to be filled out, which state that the filler must "sign and stamp." This kind of custom has not been popular for very long. If you think that anyone can stamp the official seal, and it is even easy to fake, so you must sign it yourself as proof, then why do you need to stamp it after signing? In other words, it proves that both signing and stamping are unreliable. Otherwise, if you have already signed, why bother stamping? If you have already stamped, signing is redundant. "Signing and stamping" is like a joke of stacking beds on top of each other.</p>
<p>Originally, in the past, those who worked in government offices, whether drafting, reviewing, coordinating, or approving documents, all stamped. Later, some people felt that there were many abuses in stamping, so they switched to signing. Naturally, signing is more practical and accurate than stamping. Because in the past, many responsible officials did not review official business themselves, and the secretaries-general (directors) were also mostly empty names. The official business in the agencies was mostly reviewed and approved by a secretary, and after this secretary had read a piece of official business, he would immediately stamp the official seal of the responsible official, the secretary-general, and others, and sometimes he would also stamp the official seal of the deputy director, etc. Therefore, some people said that China's administration was "seal politics."</p>
<p>Some responsible officials prepared several name seals: one for themselves, one for the accompanying (confidential) secretary, one for the reviewing secretary, one for the seal-printing office, and one for the official residence. If he had concurrent positions, then each concurrent agency and organization would have one for standby. Because office work only recognizes the seal and not the person, some people have more than ten concurrent positions, or even concurrent positions in provinces far apart. There is no other reason; this is relying on the seal to represent him.</p>
<p>Foreigners in China's banks, post offices, etc., can receive remittances or checks as long as they sign the form, or at most show their passport. However, Chinese people who receive payments from banks, money shops, post offices, etc., must not only sign but also stamp, and must also have a shop guarantee or bank guarantee before payment is allowed. "No guarantee, no payment" is engraved with a fixed seal and placed on the remittance note. I don't know who came up with this trick, which makes it very difficult for the payee. Sometimes some people can't find a shop guarantee, show their identity, and still can't get the money. In recent years, the postal remittances have specified "signature or stamp" in the payee column, which is a convenient method and truly a great merit.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that signatures are easy to forge, so you must stamp again. In fact, what is easy to forge is the seal, not the signature. This is something that anyone who has a little knowledge of calligraphy can understand. However, the world is full of people blindly following the seal as the basis of credit and ignoring the individual's signature; even more, they want to use both the signature and the seal, which is truly unthinkable.</p>
<h3>Paper and Brush</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>History says that during the reign of Emperor He of the Han Dynasty, the eunuch Cai Lun used tree bark and hemp heads to make paper, so now everyone says that it was created by Cai Lun. In the shrines dedicated to the ancestral masters of various industries, there is a statue of Cai Lun, a handsome young man dressed like a young master in a drama, I do not know the source. But according to the Biography of Empress Zhao in the History of Ban, there is a "scarlet", and the Records of the Western Capital calls it "thin hoof", with a note saying that it is small paper; and the Stories of the Three Assistants says that the crown prince used paper to block his nose; all of which were before Emperor He of the Han Dynasty, so it can be known that paper did not originate with Cai Lun. Perhaps Cai Lun only began to refine the processing, so later generations only called him by that name.</p>
<p>Brushes did not originate with Meng Tian, as the ancients have said. Li Shi's Continued Record of Diverse Things says: Wang Shu has said: Since the beginning of writing, there should have been brushes. It is said that it began with Meng Tian, which is probably not true. According to Taigong, "The hairs are luxuriant, they can be removed from the water, and the writing will not come alive." Also, when Confucius wrote the Classic of Filial Piety, he wore a hairpin, a blue brush, and a 单衣, facing north and bowing, which shows that the origin of the brush is long ago. If it is said that at that time it was carved with a knife as a brush, then Taigong's words of "luxuriant hairs" seem to clearly refer to a writing brush. The Brush Classic says: Tian used deer hair as a column and sheep hair as a covering, which proves that the brush was made more skillfully by Meng Tian, but it was not created by Tian. Only rabbit hair was not mentioned. Han Changli's Biography of Mao Ying says that Meng Tian went to Zhongshan to pull out his hairs, etc., which is probably a playful text that has not been deeply considered. It was not until the Calligrapher Wang's Brush Classic that it was said that the rabbits in Zhongshan were fat and had long hairs, which seems to be the beginning of rabbit hair. The Qing people always valued purple hair when writing regular script, because purple hair is firm and sharp, making the writing more vigorous and organized, especially for those who need to excel in calligraphy in the imperial examinations, such as superior tributes, selected tributes, and进士殿试, then purple hair is almost indispensable. Calligraphers such as Li Meian and Zeng Nongran all used purple hair exclusively, even when the characters were more than a foot large. (Liu Shannong said that his writing was not as good as Zeng Li's because he could not use purple hair to write large characters.) It is also said that Liu Shian used purple hair exclusively throughout his life, but the value of large brushes with purple hair is several times that of sheep hair, because this hair has fewer long tips and is also more difficult to split and make.</p>
<h3>Do It When You Think of It</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>The manager of a certain company in the United States felt that the employees in the store had the problem of hesitation and indecision, and wanted to correct this trend, so he posted slogans everywhere in the store, and the slogans were the four characters "Do it when you think of it."</p>
<p>Soon, the slogan had an unexpected effect!</p>
<p>Their chief accountant embezzled $20,000 of public funds and ran away; an accountant and his beautiful female secretary eloped quietly; twelve clerks jointly demanded a raise; and a tea boy in the writing room ran to Hollywood to become a movie star. (Translated from "Crown")</p>
<h3>Historical Figures: Shi, Wang, Xue</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Someone asked, "What is the story of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* about?" I replied, "I once discussed it before, but my thoughts were not fully expressed, and my research was also incomplete." I believe that since the Jia household is a noble family, it is a miniature of the imperial family. It is not wrong to view it as a court drama. The Jia family's series of events are the common historical occurrences involving relatives of the emperor and empresses. Therefore, *Dream of the Red Chamber* is also a political novel. Grandmother Jia is not significantly flawed, and her nature is kind and generous. However, she is old, senile, and only indulges in pleasure, allowing Wang Xifeng to wield power. Her son, Zheng, is mediocre and incompetent, becoming foolishly filial. The Jia family's near downfall is Grandmother's fault. After Grandmother passes, Wang Furen will succeed her. Wang appears to be kind and benevolent but is actually very harsh. Her treatment of Jin Chuan and Qing Wen is lamentable. Xifeng and Xiren are both Wang's party, and she further introduces Aunt Xue to strengthen her forces. Xue has great ambitions and first attaches herself to Wang to build her power. Since Zheng is useless, Zhu has already died young, and Lan is a young grandson, Baochai must marry Baoyu for Wang's faction to be established. Daiyu and Xiangyun are no match for her. Xiangyun, at the decline of the Shi family, tried but failed. The golden unicorn incident diminished as soon as it started, proving that the Shi family is not a match for the Wang faction. Yuanyang's suicide for her master shows that she knew she was isolated and would inevitably be humiliated. Lin Meimei repeatedly lamented that she had no one to rely on, only Grandmother's love, which was ultimately unreliable. Even with her jealousy and suspicion, and all her efforts, she could not withstand the conspiracy and became a sacrifice. Even if Baoyu had not disappeared, he might not have been a good family manager. His nature is fickle, and Baochai and Xiren could easily manipulate him. Moreover, since he disappeared, it can be said that Wang and Xue's plan has succeeded. Shi, Wang, and Xue successively controlled the Jia family's affairs. The entire book narrates events consistently, regardless of whether the author is one person or two. I believe their consciousness is such. Baochai still has a child in her womb, with promising prospects. However, Li Wan is biding her time in obscurity. Once Lan grows up, the Jia family might be revived, and the Li family will gain power. It is unknown at that time who will win between the Li and Xue families. If I were to write a sequel, I would focus on this.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jianxia's Book Collection</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>In the first month of Yiyou year, I obtained Jiang Jianxia's old collection of *Jingji Fanggu Zhi* in eight volumes from a bookstore on Hulong Street in Suzhou for 800 yuan in counterfeit currency. The cover has Jianxia's handwritten inscription, which reads: "Jingji Fanggu Zhi, six juan, with a supplement of one juan, in eight volumes. In the second month of Guangxu Ji Chou year, gifted by Zhuzi Han Zhizhong. Jianxia, recorded." Below is a seal with the characters "Jianxia." In the book, the line formats of each recorded book are circled in red ink, presumably to compile a "Table of Line Formats of Song and Yuan Editions." There are also one or twenty annotations, mentioning that after Jingzhou Chen Hengshan (a licentiate) obtained a Song edition of *Zhong Shuo*, he immediately pasted it onto a board and re-engraved it. Hengshan also obtained a Northern Song edition of *Two Lis' Collection of Matching Poems*. After making a Jing edition, he gifted the original book to Chuan Mouyuan (Yunlong). These are all anecdotes from the book world, which can be used as talking points. To paste a Song edition onto a board and re-engrave it would be a great aesthetic crime.</p>
<p>Jianxia's given name was Biao; his courtesy name was Xuan , and another name was Yun , Shi , a native of Qing Yuanhe, and an indoor disciple of Ye Lishang. He once served as the academic commissioner of Hunan. In Guangxu Wuxu year, he was ordered to work in the Zongli Yamen (Foreign Office). After Kang and Liang's failure, he was dismissed and lived in seclusion on the sea, indulging in fine wine and women, and died within a year. "Hai Hua" also mentions him, using "Jiang Jianyun" to allude to his name, a handsome young man with an unconventional and extraordinary character.</p>
<p>Jianxia's book collection was quite rich, and he also engraved many books. While in Changsha, he commissioned Vice Minister Wu Xianzai to paint "Xiushu Gang" (Hill of Book Repair). Jianxia himself stated, "I have no fondness for dogs, horses, silk, bamboo, nor can I drink. I only spend my days close to books and history... I collected and engraved manuscripts of predecessors and contemporaries, compiling several volumes of Yunzhai Ge Series of Books. He also obtained Chen Si's edition of *Tang Ren Xiao Ji* (Minor Collections of Tang Poets) in forty-nine families, engraved in the Southern Song Dynasty, and paid for it to be reprinted without losing a hair... The printing of Tang Ren Xiao Ji is extremely fine. Several copies were printed with leather paper. A bookstore in Suzhou once used a damaged copy of this book, dyed it, and pretended it was a Song edition to deceive Mr. Wu Qu'an. He only discovered the deception after purchasing it for several days, which shows how exquisite the book is." Scores of prominent figures of the time wrote poems of praise on the “Xiushu Gang,” Liang Rengong (Liang Qichao) wrote “Tens of thousands of scholars are only chattering insects following others, and one or two people at most understand. This comes from the East and the West. There are Qian Yanliao of Boyang in the past, and there are the horizontal words of Yuanhe today. Take all the book lists of the world, like looking for stones in the imperial library.” Tan Fusheng (Tan Sitong) also wrote a poem that says, “Those who rush to patch things up in Lu are misguided to the old nest for all birds. The public doesn’t mind spoiling the scenery, and immediately pays for it to be burned by the founding emperor.” “Even if the spiritual roots are cut off, there will be leftovers. Repentance in the next life will be in vain. The boring shells mix together. The body is already disgusted, let alone books!” Liang and Tan, who were leaders of the reform movement, talked eloquently, and Fusheng's words were particularly forthright, reflecting his personality. Learning increases daily, as the Old Master said. Abandoning all poetry and books is the only way to enter the Tao. Wu Zhilao's words about burning all thread-bound books were not thorough enough. Around the Wuxu Reform, the opinions of prominent figures of the time were like this. Jianxia was also called a member of the "Reform Party" at the time.</p>
<p>Jianxia also wrote many books, including *Table of Line Formats of Song and Yuan Editions* and *Huang Yuji Nian Du*, which involved scholars of daily records and editions. He was also able to paint, and was particularly skilled in flowers.</p>
<p>Jianxia was eager to serve the world, but after a brief venture, he returned defeated. In the end, he became famous as a book collector. Was this Jianxia's misfortune? Ye Jushang expressed deep sorrow for Jianxia’s death. (Ye Jushang's six-volume edition of *Shuji Jishi Shi* (Poems Recording Book Events) was engraved by Jianxia. The seven-volume edition was engraved by Ye's family, and Jianxia had already passed away, so there is a poem about it.)</p>
