<p>社論</p>
<h3>從美國女敎士被殺說起</h3>
<p>據聯合社漢口十三日電稱：『　　美國女敎士安德森與諾特霸二女士暨芬蘭　務敎士柏爾格博士，已於上星期内在漢口西北一百五十英里處，慘遭共匪　殺，戰區外國敎會工作人員即將實行大規模之撤退。據目擊其事者談稱，共匪在高呼「你們是英國人，美國人就該死」之後，即將此美國女敎士及芬　醫生三人開槍擊斃；當時企個勸阻之中國人二名，亦被擊斃。」我們看了聯合社的報道，眞是感　萬千，一時不知話從何說起。我們姑且把一切拋開不談，僅僅站在人道的立塲，對於共匪慘無人性的暴行，也是不能不表示憤慨的。</p>
<p>第一，我國在抗戰勝利之後，遭遇到共匪的稱兵作亂，實在是我國家民族的一大不幸。而一般自命爲自由主義者，明知共匪是汨滅人性的亂黨，但猶以歐美各國的普通政黨目之，對於政府的戡亂剿匪的重要工作，不僅不積極參與其事，反而袖手旁觀，甚至有時還要推波助瀾，共匪猖獗到此地步，一般自命爲自由主義者不能不負相當責任。我們在報章雜誌，常見有記載共匪暴行恣意屠殺老百姓的文字，質之一般自命爲自由主義者，他們不是替共匪辯議，就是說道是政府的宣傳攻勢。不知他們對於這條新聞發生什麽感想？更不知他們又將如何替共匪辯護？共匪的猙獰面目，早已暴露無遺，自命爲自由主義者的人們，終也應該淸醒了吧！爲什麼還要替沒有人性的亂黨張目呢？</p>
<p>第二，共匪採取這種反美的暴行，與五十年前引起八國聯軍的義和團，實在沒有兩樣；這種盲目的排外運動，不論從那一個角度去觀察，抑對於國家民族，或對於世界人類，都是有害無益的，中國經過四十八年的內憂外患，到了今天，不論在什麽方面，都有長足的進步，是絕不容許「扶淸滅洋」的義和團，再生於今日的。共匪向來自稱爲前進份子，面幹這種反時代的暴行，在共匪固不足惜，但我們不能不爲中華民國的前途悲！</p>
<p>第三，共匪發動反美運動，由來已久；在抗戰勝利之後，共匪爲了爭降未能逞其野心，就遷怒於美國，在匪區高呼「打倒美國帝國主義」的口號，並鼓動他人反對美援。其用心如何？不　可知。共匪　腦毛澤東於去年十二月二十五日發表文吿，也以「　國現正指違反革命戰爭」爲言，大肆抨擊美國政府。我們終以爲共匪的反美，不致皂白不分，把善良的美國女敎士也放在「打倒」之列。但是現在事實上，共匪的口號是「你們是美國人，美國人就該死。」這種盲目的反美暴行，在現代國家裏是找不到第二個例子的。</p>
<p>第四，美國朝野對於我國共匪，近來雖已有比較正確的認識，但是還沒有完全認識淸楚。過去美國人士大半以爲共匪是一個革命的政黨，主張實行土地改革，故馬歡爾國務卿最初也要　國政府擴大基礎，成立一個民卞政府把共匪也包括在內；到後來才恍然大悟，要共匪加入政府是不可能的。現在看到美國女敎士的被殺，更可以認淸共匪猙獰的面目的了。過去美國時常有新聞記者，到中國來採訪新聞，常受共匪的蒙蔽，看不淸事實，我們吿以共匪的暴行，他們大都半信半疑，以爲共匪不致幹出這種慘絕人寰的暴行；但是現在美國女敎士被殺的事實，　一般的放在世人的眼前，你們還能不相信嗎？</p>
<p>要之，美國女敎士被共匪屠殺的事件，不僅暴露出共匪猙獰醜惡的面目，而且也是對於美國去年一年來對華政策的一個譏諷。我們要美國朝野咸能明暸，中國共匪的反美運動，已經如火如荼，一發不可遏止了，究其所以如比胆大妄爲，以慘絕人寰的暴行加諸美國女敎士，實有其國際上的背景，所以美國如欲維持遠東的和平與安定，如欲保持其在遠東的地位，則對於刻正在堅苦戡亂中的中國政府，應立即予以全面的援助，不容再有所顧忌了。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹局勢的動亂</h3>
<p>自巴爾幹聯盟（由南斯拉夫，保加利亞，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，暨阿爾巴尼亞五國組成者）於去歲十二月間成立之後，近代史上素稱爲「歐洲火藥庫」的巴爾幹半烏，不啻成爲一「小型世界」，反映出兩大集團鬥爭的白熱化，較之世界任何一角落，尤　　　。而　　　，除了羅馬尼亞　生　　而外，地中海上的風　忽　緊急，大有山雨欲來之勢。　　　　大來世界各國的通訊社的　　，　　人注目之　實，　下列各項：　希臘游擊隊領袖馬柯斯將軍在　國北部組織「希臘自由政府」之後，又將要求正式參加歐洲新共　國際，企圖取得共產黨的無限制之軍事援助，　　國　近文復將潛水艇及其他軍艦　　土耳其，以增强其　艱尼　海峽之防務，從而阻過共產主義勞力之優入地中海；　英國地中海艦隊將在希臘西南之伊沃寗海，舉行海軍演習；　美國將以武力干涉希臘內亂之說，甚囂　上。我們僅就此四事而論，歐洲局勢的嚴重，也就不言可知了。</p>
<p>倫敦四國外長會議的不歡而散，雖使一九四七年在黯淡的氛圍裏吿終，但免一般人士對於一九四八年的來到，終　存着若干樂觀的心情，而希望來年能有「柳暗花明又一邨」的一天。可是在今年最初的十幾天裏，我們所看到的世界，到處是秼馬厲兵準備大戰的景象；我們所聽到的，是一片「美蘇必戰」的流言蜚語；在一九四八年剛剛開始的時候，所謂「一年之計在於春」，就充滿了這些凶惡的報這，實在是我們人類即將再度遭遇浩刧的惡兆，使對於世界和平最有信心的人們，也不敢一味樂觀了。巴爾幹的危機，足以造成世界的亂源，世人對此，自應特別提高警覺，尤其是負有世界安危之責的國際政治外交家，應該高矚遠贍，運用其政治知　，杜微防漸，先將籠罩在地中海天際的陰霾一掃而空，　從而透射出和平安定的陽光來。</p>
<p>一般人評論世界局勢，莫不謂戰後的世界已到了山窮水盡的地步，不論是遠東問題或是歐洲僵局，都沒有解決的希望；但是我們觀察世界局勢的動向，研究一切國際問題的　　所在，深知世界大局的開朗，並不是一件絕對不可能的專情；換言之，只要支配今日世界命運的列强能够大徹大悟，咸以世界的和平與安定爲重，而將其本國的利害置於次耍地位，則分裂的世界，就可以「破鏡重圓」，復歸於一，戰後所發生的一切國際問題，也就不難迎刃而解了。所以世界問題的癥結，在於列强的自私自利，不能互忍互讓，因而造成兩大集團積不相容的局面；此在巴爾幹小型世界，益復如斯，目前緊張的局勢能否緩和，其關鍵完全操在美蘇兩國的手裏，只要美蘇兩國能够釋嫌修好，地中海上的風雲立即就可消散。同時我們站在第三者的立塲　　美苗人兩方的　　，也怎不以世界和平　　　　　　　　理想，世界公　　　　起，對於雙方均屬有害無益的。基於此項認識，可知思想不同，固不足以妨害　方的合作，就是和表　衝突，也不致引起雙方立即以兵戎相見。世人對於世界和平的信心，也　　　。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰的勝利，可謂中英美法蘇五　　誠合作的結果，戰　旣能在「勝利第一」的原則之下携手合作，戰後自然也能在「和平第一」的原則之下共同努力。但是勝利後兩年有半以來的情形，爲什麽過與我們的理想背道而馳呢？其中主要原因，不能不歸罪於互爭世界領導權的美蘇兩國。緣自大戰勝利結束之後，美蘇變方雖均以「和平」「合作」相號召，一再舉行國際會議，以收抬戰後世界的殘局；但是雙方只知替自已打算，而不能見其大者，爲整個世界着想。因此雙方對於任回國際問題，均抱着相反的意見，世人雖也希望美蘇爾國能從小異中求大問，但是雙方的意見，却愈爭愈遠，近東的伊朗問題，雖能獲得差强人意的解決辦法，但是希臘問題的僵局始終未能打開，聽任其成爲巴爾幹的亂源。迨至去年二三月間，希臘局勞日趨嚴重，使杜魯門總統不得不向國會發出緊急的呼號，要求國會撥款四億美元援助希土兩國，用以抵抗外夾勢力的侵入，所謂杜魯門主義就此誕生，引起蘇聯嚴重的反響，不僅對美採取不妥協態度，而且在國際上積極進行反美運動，使美蘇關係發展至短兵相接的階段。後來馬歇爾爲了緩和美蘇關係起見，乃提出援歐計劃，把蘇聯也列在「受援國」之一，用意雖美，但是蘇聯不特拒不接受，而且領導他國共起反對，一方面有所謂「莫洛打夫計劃」，與馬歇爾計劃相對抗；另一方面又發起組織新共產　　，發動「反美〕「反援」運動，以鞏固蘇聯在歐洲的地位。從此歐洲分裂爲二，不再有妥協的可能，倫敦外長會議的失敗，就是一個鐵證，現在美國國會正在那裏討論長期援歐計劃，同時對於希土兩國又積極推行杜魯門主義，蘇聯在巴爾幹回手還擊，也是必然的結果。</p>
<p>要之，巴爾幹的動亂及地中海的風雲緊急，實可謂美蘇衝突的表面化，欲求歐洲局勢的開朗，唯一正本淸源的辦法，只有美蘇兩國的釋嫌重修前好。恢復戰時精誠合作的精神。否則不論美國如何說法，援助歐洲穩定經濟即可避免戰爭，或是蘇聯怎樣說反美的動機出於和平，各行各是的結果，勢必引起新的戰禍！</p>

<h3>女敎士遇害經過</h3>
<p>（上接一版）</p>
<p>據同行生還者之口述，渠等與遇害之三敎士同搭一公路車，自豫省之信陽南行入鄂，至七日午後行至離荆門三十哩之處，公路車突被匪徒五十餘人阻止前進，所有乘客均被喝令離車，三敎士離車後，匪徒即屬聲日，「你們是美國人，美國人就該死」，其中貝克因未聲明爲芬籍，首被匪徒槍殺，匪徒旋即舉槍直逼兩女敎士，同行之國人兩名見義勇爲，上前勸阻，首被射殺，兩女敎士繼之退害，其餘之旅客則被放行。目前三敎士之死體均經發現裝棺，決定候輸運漢，安葬如儀。以上爲三教士遇害之大致情形</p>
<p>敎會措施</p>
<p>此不幸事件發生後，美駐漢領事培根再度勸吿美籍人士連離豫鄂危險地帶，同時敎會負責人士亦已急電華中之外籍工作人員，連即撤退至安全地區，目前該區已設立撤退站兩所，一爲老河口，週前曾爲共軍所圍攻，目下已集中美國人二十名及挪威人四十名；另一爲鄭州，該地首先將撤退敎，會醫院中之百名工作人員，第二步為將來自隴海東段集中鄭州之外籍敎士。絡續設法運出。訥爾遜氏已明確宣佈，撤退之際，不分畛域，天主敎徒及耶敎徒均一視同仁，以「聖保羅」號空運。據訥氏及其他敎會人士之估計，外籍敎士之身陷匪區及在危險地區，在五百人以上，其中已有近二百人集中漢市，該地敎會對彼等之供養，已漸成問題</p>
<p>敎士反響</p>
<p>三敎士遇害之消息於昨午證實後，記者曾訪若干敎會機關，一部份敎會人士認爲一九二七年逼使六千名外籍敎士自華撤退者，其主動者即爲共黨，今日共匪所採之手段，與過去並無相與之處。記者復晤自許昌撤退來滬之敎士漢森氏，談及共匪對於敎士之態度，據謂：在表面上，並無明顯反美之處，例如許昌被攻佔時，敎會建築之牆壁上，並無一張反美之標語，亦無加害敎士之行爲，但在言談之間，則自然流露反美色彩，其初佔許昌時，允許「保護敎士之生命財產及自由」，但事實上，共匪士兵常登堂入室，破壊住所內之器具設備，且有索取衣服手錶等事件發生。</p>
<h3>葉楚傖靈櫬安葬</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十三日電〕故國府委員立法院副院長葉楚傖氏靈櫬，業於今日上午自城內中山堂靈堂起靈，逕發木賣靈岩山南麓墓園，下午二時十五分靈柩下窆，國府蔣主席代表邵力子·中央執監委會代表居正，及陳立夫·王懋功·吳鐵城·鈕永建·張厲生·洪蘭友·錢大鈞·狄膺·方治·吳開先等均趕臨墓前致祭，祭禮至四時許始吿完畢，此一代黨國偉人，從此長眠於吳中秀色之靈岩地下矣！葉氏墓園占地廿五畝遍栽靑松翠柏，山靈水秀，墓園中央建有紀念亭碑，聞葉氏家屬決以中央褒揚令文勒石，以埀永久紀念。</p>
<h3>凱倫過滬談話</h3>
<p>（上接一版）凱倫勛爵在東南亞主要任務，乃與鄰近各國接洽糧食事宜，問及目前糧食供應情形，渠稱：較前已進步，雖然東南亞三大產糧國—暹羅·緬甸及印度戰後產量遠不如往昔，但據其本人看來，並不悲觀。凱氏繼稱，諸產糧國之交通受戰爭破壞甚劇，致影響生產。根據聯合國糧食農業機構在印度會議估計諸產糧國欲恢復戰前之同等產量，尙須五年之久。目前東南亞各國均實行計口授糧制度，馬來亞人民每日僅給米四兩半，彼等雖可獲得麵粉，但拘於習慣，均不願食勉粉，故米之需要更大。中國糧食，大都仰自暹羅，按月由曼谷連華，聯合國各國家最近組織一糧食聯絡會，按月舉行會議，討論糧食問題，凱氏即該會主席，聯絡會議第一次大會，於本月六日舉行，結果相當圓滿，席間各國代表開誠布公，互相協助，以多濟少，使各人感到樂觀。</p>
<p>按凱氏於一九三六年六月應前政院院長宋子文之請，曾來華商討中國糧食問題。</p>
<p>記者復詢以東南亞人民排斥華僑是否確實，凱氏立即回答此事雖非在本人職務範圍內，但本人任職彼地，確知絕無此事，非但無反華人情形，而事實且相反，凱氏再三吿稱：「此點本人可絕對舉告者。」渠並表不深愛中國熱誠，對於此次乘中航霸王號機來滬亦頻頻稱道舒適愉快。</p>

<h3>防止西歐經濟窒息　促速批准援歐案　馬卿要求國會作歷史性決議</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿十二日向眾院外交委員會陳述援歐方案之意見，力言該方案係爲應付一重大的危機，並向國會提出一下問題：「吾人將以行動應付此一局勢歟？抑將袖手旁觀，而允許其他勢力決定歐洲文明未來之命運歟」？</p>
<p>馬卿並指出國會就援歐方案採取之行動，必須具備下列上條件：　迅速；　適當的數額；（三）執行之際有效而具彈性；　須與其他參加國保持合作。馬歇爾並强調該方案對美國之重要。渠云：「吾人苟不於今日出動應付此一問題，則他日仍將在對我更不利的條件下發生此一問題。歐洲局勢，尚未達經濟的不安定正向專橫制度進展的程度，但若美國不予歐洲之自助以支持，則該項進展將屬不可避免。美國今日所面臨者爲歷史性的決議，對吾國所負使命的挑戰，至爲嚴重，援助之目的在防止現正威脅西歐的經濟窒息，而不損害其國家的完整。援助計劃雖將使美國人民接受負担，然計劃輸出之數量，尚較過去十五個月爲低，成立決議之際，應以吾人最斟酌的利益爲基礎，最主要者厥爲歐洲持久和平及個人自由之維持。</p>
<p>西歐合作深加贊許</p>
<p>馬卿繼對歐洲十六國之允諾實行合作制度表示贊許，並指出援歐最初十五個月內美國建議供給之援助額六十八億元，較巴黎會議之佔計減少百分之二十。關於管理該方案之計劃，馬卿表示準備同意妥協計劃，聲明於此並無成見，但渠認爲管理之權力，宜交與一人而非一個委員會行使，而與外交政策有關之事務應由國務卿控制，及指揮。馬卿最後復曰：歐洲經濟復興，爲維護世界最危急區域內的基本自由所必需，亦爲恢復全球正常貿易之不能或缺，世界今僅美國一國，具有支持此項運動之能力。渠並大聲疾呼，「吾人需要和平，安全，及世界之迅速恢復正常，吾人爲環境所驅，置身領導地位，重大的危機必須克服，吾人務須克服」云。共和黨議員史密斯詢，此一方案不致引起戰爭？馬卿表示該方案不致引起戰爭且可避免戰爭，此事猶如賭博，未必有一定把握，但若全力以赴，未必有一定把握，但若全力以赴，成功之希望極大。渠並提出警告謂，若半途而廢，則歐洲將發生極大之反感，若無適當的方案，則金錢等於虛擲，不如根本沒有援歐方案。</p>
<p>計劃目標穩定歐洲</p>
<p>馬卿復被詢及西歐及美洲反抗蘇聯侵略的機會，渠答曰：西歐大體而言，均無適當準備以從事此等反抗，大部份當視人民是否支持其政府而定，此等發展將使美國不得不重新考慮其外交政策，但渠目前尚不願就此加以揣測。最後渠並聲明，「吾人所建議者非爲侵略計劃亦非防禦計劃，乃爲使歐洲趨於穩定，穩定之增加，即可使侵略之機會減少」。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕據遠東國際法庭檢察處今晨向庭方所提出之最機密文件，日陸軍省曾決定在日本完成軍事征服中國前，日本堅決拒絕與排除其他國家對中日戰爭之干涉。此項秘密文件上所載之日期，爲一九三七年十月十一日。該文件中稱，「在吾人完成吾人軍事行動之前，九國公約簽訂或國際聰明之干涉或公斷，將永不能使中國有改悔之意」。該文件繼稱，然軍事目標經達到後，和平之公斷將可予以接受，同時日本應於「適當時機」將此項決定通知德國及義大利，並要求該二國對此決定予以支持。據該文件稱，十日後即十月廿一日，日陸海外三相會一致決定支持上述政策。據陸相杉山元海相米內光政及外相廣田弘毅之聯合決議稱，「在日本幾近完成在華之軍事行動目標前，吾人絕對拒絕與排除第三國之冒昧干涉或公斷」。文件中並稱，此項決定之公佈或結果，各外國政府之有關通知應在避免之列，俾使外界不致有認爲「吾人由於帝國內之若干弱點，而致願急速結束中國事件」之印象，僅有德義可於「適當時機」予以通知，俾在誘使此二軸心國「隨吾人之意有所行動。」</p>

<h3>上海小姐飛抵滬機塲一幕尷尬戲　榮梅莘淚眼趨迎謝家驊掉頭逕去</h3>

<p>謝家驊此次應香港某影片公司之邀赴港拍片，其夫榮梅莘未予同意，故在謝雲港後，榮即趕去迫謝返滬，雙方大吵大打，幾釀成命案，結果則形成僵局。昨日謝返滬，事前先通知其母家親戚在國防部任上尉職之顧某及長寗警分局課任職之堂兄謝子英，到機塲迎接。其夫榮梅莘則亦獲得「情報」，而於飛機抵達前趕到機塲。唯謝於下機後，對榮未加理睬，即與其母坐入預備之汽車直駛堂兄家中。</p>
<p>榮本擬接謝至以前兩人結婚後同居之所在，遭此拒絕，情形頗尷尬。據目擊者談，當時榮淚盈滿眶，　住謝之汽車，向其岳母哀稱「面子有關」，求謝與其同行。但謝母答以「有話可到醫院去講」，旋即馬達開動，疾馳而去。</p>

<h3>警部審問貪汚大隊長　戚再玉帶鐐上法庭與吳寶康夫婦對質　承辦徐繼莊案時曾獲大宗財物</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備司令部第六稽查大隊長戚再玉貪汚舞弊案，於昨日起在該部開庭審訊。主審者爲副司令楊步飛，軍法處處長曾昭貽，科長朱誠，書記李潔。審訊自上午九時半開始，至下午五時始告一段落。受審人物除戚外，爲金潤聲（庶務），薛建時（庶務），蔣石林（秘書），周文遠（少校督察），黃華榮（書記），黃志戚（上慰稽查員），郁長生（勤工）等七人。另傳實康無綫電行主人吳寶康夫婦及賬房陸任仰等三人到庭對質。戚再玉押上法庭時身穿短服，脚上鐵鐐銀鐺，形容甚爲沮喪。</p>
<p>戚所犯各案中，敲詐吳寶康法幣四億餘元一節，昨已大致審畢，案情業已明暸。戚本人雖仍聲辯否認，但據悉因證據確鑿，恐已難逃法綱。</p>
<p>戚之得力助手鑫潤聲別號金駝子，爲本市小有聲名之「白相人」。戚之向人敲詐即以金爲「橋樑」，由金出面活動。此人在敵偽時期亦有劣　，此次罪名當亦不輕。</p>
<p>今日警備部繼續審訊本案，並將傳日人權井到庭，因戚所犯另一案係利用橫井向日僑敲詐。間不及，未及審問。</p>
<p>又悉戚之另一罪案爲接受徐繼莊賄賂。戚之家中曾查出財物價值鉅云。</p>
<p>〔華東社訊〕據可靠方面消息：戚案已有重要新發展，蓋徐繼莊案由第六大隊承辦時，徐繼莊住宅保險箱中所有之全部飾物，包括大小鑽戒五十餘只，十兩金條數十根，及徐繼莊本人所乘汽車一輛，悉爲戚所獲，關於此點，當避均已獲得證據云。</p>

<h3>于斌暢談美國援華　在本市各界歡迎會上報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕天主敎南京區總主敎于斌，上月杪自美考究返國後，十一日下午三時出席本市各界假湖社舉行之歡迎茶會。歡迎會由潘議長主持，出席者市黨部方主委及各團體代表三百餘人。首由潘議長致歡迎詞，略稱：「于總主敎此次出國，實負國民外交之重任，在美二月，與友邦各方接觸，消除不少誤會，對推進中美兩國間之精誠合作，自有莫大帮助。于總主敎於抗戰期間，宣揚國策，磋功甚偉。勝利後以共匪騷亂，民生凋敝，吾人益須負有國際聲望之人士，多多向友邦人士說明中國共匪之內亂，不僅爲中國問題，並爲世界和平之大患。于總主敎甫於日前自美返國，其帶回之海外觀感，必能加强吾人對國際之認識及對友邦之了解」。</p>
<p>一般見解逐漸轉變</p>
<p>于總主敎旋在熱烈掌聲中起立致詞，渠除對各界歡迎感情表示感謝外，詳詳細論述旅美觀感及美國朝野各方對華認識之演進。渠稱：「本人係於去年十月八日抵達舊金山，十日出席天主敎大會後，旋赴波士敦，十一月初旬至華府。杜魯門總統適召集特別會議，參眾兩院議員雲集於此，本人乃獲得一交換意見之極好機會。會議開始時，各議員大部認爲緊急援助之對象應以歐洲法義奧三國爲重心，中國問題則被認爲次要。但自周以德議員於眾院提出應將中法義奧四國共同列入緊急援助對象後，經愼重辯論，一般見解遂漸轉變。故至該案表決時，除兩票外，其餘全體贊成通過援助對象加入中國。但當轉送參院通過並經總統核准提付兩院撥款委員會時，該案重起波折。一般委員仍認爲通過之緊急援華六千萬美元，數目並不大，但不妨過年後再行撥付。</p>
<p>對華政策豁然開朗</p>
<p>此時積極支持援華主張諸君向參院撥款委員會痛切陳詞，說明中國問題之嚴重性與緊急性，乃獲通過先　二千萬美元，而眾院撥款委員會仍未完全表示同意。遂有人主張寗可放棄安度聖誕節，將會期延長，繼續討論者。當塲爭執甚烈，並有人主張援華須經濟及軍事並重，旋於十八日決定一折衷辦法，先撥一千八百萬美元，充作緊急援華貸款。本月七月日國會重開後，杜魯門總統提出之長期援華方案，亦可視爲根據去年十二月十八日民意之決定而來。今後須商討者，僅爲各種屬於細則之技術問題。中央茲已派定負責技術人員赴美，相信長期援華方案，可望於一二週內即正式提出。吾人必須注意，近一月來，美國對華政策憶有豁然開朗之改變者凡三點。</p>
<p>馬卿支持貸華款項</p>
<p>美政府自二次大戰開始後，即根據「先歐後亞」之原則，推行其政策。此項觀念，造成頗多不良影響。但以遠識政治家之倡導，一般美人對世界局勢近已有進一步認識，逐漸改變向來之「先歐後亞」之觀念爲「歐亞並重」之觀念。緊急援華一千八百萬元美貸，於緊張之會議中，卒獲通過，實可謂美人「世界觀」改變之第一次具體表現。蓋此案之獲通過，實已打破多年原則，歷史之走入新階段也。（二）馬歇爾將軍在二次大戰中功績最高，美國大多數人民均寄以堅强信仰，渠於去年調處中國問題失敗返國後，益加深美國孤立派「袖手旁觀」之主張。彼等普遍之錯誤觀念，往往認爲中國共黨固不可理喻，但國民黨亦未免相當頑固。惟就馬歇爾將軍此次積極支持援華美貸觀之，即可知渠不但對華並不誤角，且不願「袖手旁觀」。一千八百萬美元之撥付，實乃積極援華之開始；不但屬於經濟援助，且將衣於軍事援助。</p>
<p>奸匪作亂美已認識</p>
<p>美國一般與論，以往頗多認爲中國內亂僅爲中國本身問題，共匪則不過農民要求土地改革，與國際共產黨陳營無關，且以爲官吏貪汚，政府無能，即援助亦難敗效。當時抱此項觀念，近已完全改變。美國人民已普遍認識中國之奸匪實爲國際共產陣營之一環，中國之內亂不僅爲中國之事，極可能爲三次大戰之起因。而馬歇爾將軍於去冬在四國外長會議作最後努力失敗後，亦已明朗表現，「一切希望之門已全關閉，從今必須展開切實工作」，而長期援歐援華計劃，即爲此項「切實工作」之開始。</p>
<h3>兩大陣營壁壘愈顯</h3>
<p>目前世界兩大陣營之壁壘已愈益分明，美國對世界之態度亦更趨明朗與積極。但須知吾人將共同進行之積極工作，並非戰爭之開始，實爲和平之先鋒。吾人希望中美兩國互相以世界眼光看對方，同時進行「再認識」萬不可以小不忍而不亂大謀。惟有中美及民主國家密切合作，方可推進世界和平，人類幸福」。于氏致辭畢，未由方主委致答詞，渠對于於之所述，認爲在中美互相認識上，等於「上了一課」，值得吾人深切反省，力加檢討。渠並稱：「吾人以世界眼光看，無論如何，必須爲人類謀和平，共匪內亂，不僅中國之患，且爲世界人類之患，故政府剿匪戰亂，亦即爲謀世界和平之最積極工作。美國對華援助，固可感謝，但人助必先自動，吾人戰亂建國，仍須自本身努力先行敞起。」迄五時許，茶會始於熱烈情緒中，盡歡而散。</p>

<p>本屆勸募「讀者助學金」，不沿用「物品勸募隊」，為的是更廣泛更深入的推展這個運動，使每一個熱心讀者都能盡力的捐助，多多益善，少亦無妨，所謂集腋成裘，少數可以凑足鉅数。農曆新年快到了，親愛的讀者們！多節省一點糜費，去幫助正在盼望援手的青年罷。</p>

<h3>急景凋年鎭江市声</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十一日訊〕多災多難的卅六年，已經悄然過去，居安思危的人們，多半仍以一種沉重的心情，回憶在過去這一年中。所遭受的一切磨難，而最令人不能忘懐的一件事，則無過於物價，對於國家的大政方針，似乎看得很淡，這可從每天看過壁報的若干公敎人員和小市民口中，覘其大槪，尤其是在貧血的鎭江，在急景凋年臘跂頻催聲中，這現象就顯得很普遍。</p>
<p>山窮水不惡　血貧心不壞</p>
<p>鎭江在雅片戰爭以後，闢爲商埠，曾經繁榮了一個時期，但這黃金時代，在津浦滬寧通軍聯運，江輸通航江北的南通·泰興·各口而後，就迅速逝去，牠的商業條件，在進口出口方面，雖然還可保持交通便利的優勢，但是收的轉口生意，因爲在空間，時期兩面，都已削弱了重要性，鎭江當江南北之要衝，爲江蘇之省會，市區人口多至二十一萬，但消費的，大多是淸苦公敎人員，以及一些儉省的本地人，不是一個商業區，當地只有一家麵務廠，一家火柴廠，也不是一個工業區，在公務員月月喊不够的時候，商人當然要喊不行，於是鎭江就形成了一個貧血的都市，終年在鬧窮。當陽曆過年的前幾天，等於鎭江永安公司的一家百貨公司，舉行冬季大廉價，每天也很難費錢五千萬，五洋百貨在這裏，是最俏的一門，其熱鬧不過如此，無怪當地人要謙虛地說道：『我們鎭江只有窮山和惡水』，其實鎭江之山，雖日貧瘠，而鎭江的滔滔江水，泊泊淸泉，則淸冽厚重，未見其惡，鎭江現在雖然鬧貧血，可是從現有的社會習尙，政治風氣，敎育現狀，商業習慣，多方面體騐，人們的心術，還不能算壊，前途還相當光明，道希望寄託在蘇北底定，和平有　，重建一個生之者衆，食之者寡的工業區吧。</p>
<p>物價日日高　年關看淡些</p>
<p>從卅六年年底到今天鎭江的物價，緊跟積上海，每天向上漲；在如此直錢上升的漲風下，商人還說不賺錢，理由是錢雖越要越多，貨却越要越少，賣空再補，存貨必然减少，這年頭兒，商人們估存他各自的財富，是只計貨而不計錢，現當險關在邇，看漲之心益堅，所以不管你銀根怎樣緊，物價還是日日看高，祇苦了若干窮得還沒有忘情陰暦年的人們，終日須打聽商情，依照鎭江現時的物價估計，中人之家辦一份年貨，僅僅買些米粉·鹹貨，糖·油·香燭·紙馬之類，動輙要化三四百萬元，較省的如苦力·車夫·也須化個一二百萬，這筆錢沒出處，那祇好大家把這個沒奈何的年看淡些，於是，這裏已經關門的二十三家猪行，也很少想在這陰開前開門了，糖食店爲了過年，只買進了去年所用的半數原料，最大的鞋干店，每天也只望賣去五十雙鞋，香燭店的蠟燭，在日形消瘦，鞭砲店的爆竹，更顯得渺小，小焉者，如兒童玩具，在攤子上，也　若長星，這年景和去年一比，是感覺到黯淡，照規矩應該黯淡，依習俗則稍覺凄慘，然而爲了節約·戡亂·建國·人們還是把這個舊的年關看淡點好，何必活受罪！</p>
<p>店家二千九　後壁盡蕭條</p>
<p>說到年景，想到去年，據記者調査：在鎭江六十六個同業公會所屬會員的二千九百六十餘家商店中，在卅六年道一年中，較有盈餘的，首數五洋和百貨，其次爲銀錢業，國行中的「中國」與「交通」，商業銀行中的「上海銀行」，地方銀行的「省行」與「蘇農」，以及錢業中的「晋源」，油桐業平平過去，木材業上半年很不差，下半年因爲沿江有警，運輸受阻，扯了個平，糧食業多半有餘，綢布業勉數開支，西業榮榮枯互見。棉紗　因去胃有限無大利，但少數囤戶則獲利甚佳，在去年虧本最大的，首推那終年鬧煤荒的輪　業，幾乎每一家公司都說蝕本，此外，如飯菜點心館及浴堂，也都無利可獲。據一般商人談：鎭江商業之不振，其故有二：　資本小，　生　淸，　貸款少，現在工商貸款停放，押匯不能做，實物抵押，只催贖不接押，今後資本不裕之商家，如乞靈於高利貸，危機更大，目前銀根抽緊之結果，也祗能做到利弊互見，而難望絕對的有助於物價之抑平，這因為鎭江之囤積商，為數極少，所以鎭江的商店，除了少數　　糧食店外，什九都無堆棧，什九都是三壁不空，一壁蕭知，這一壁就是過去滿蔽存貨的後進一壁，後壁蕭條，這是鎭江商塲的普遍現象，所以去年鎭江商家，所能勉力獻諸國家的直接稅，全年祇有十三億，道數目目，他們還感覺吃力。</p>
<p>可憐的油條　瘦弱不禁風</p>
<p>可是商人的說法雖然有其近情之理由，但據一般消費的大衆看法，覺得政府在緊縮通貨，抽緊銀根的今日，如能實行普遍配購食糧和日用必需品，再益之以合理近情的辦法，來平抑物價，經濟現狀，應可改善，不過各地的平價政策，倘使祗能加諸於大餅油條與開水，不許加價，睜隻眼，閉隻限，讓他們天天小天天瘦，天天少，道辦法是不足爲訓的，現在鎭江的一千元一根油條，已經有奇蹟發現，那三寸長，六分寬，可憐的油條，瘦弱得擋不住一陣微風，說不定就會吹掉到地下去。（本報特派員房滄浪）</p>

<p>〔本報蘇州十三日電〕本縣二度擴併鄕鎭，決於二月一日實施，現有一二九鄕鎭，將再縮併成五十九鄕鎭，以便利督導，增强行政效率。</p>
<h3>常州農民之友</h3>
<p>〔本報武進十日訊〕江南大平原的心臟區，　滿的黃金穀在淡淡的秋陽下成千成萬石的登場，辛苦了三春一夏的農民，到秋收冬藏的時候，不能不聯想起這二位農民之友：戚電力廠，和中農行。</p>
<p>電廠輪廓</p>
<p>戚電力廠在武進東門外距城約十五公里之丁堰和戚　　兩鎭之間，廠址占地頗廣，東與機械廠比連烟突高聳，工房鱗列，在京滬車過客一瞥下，宛然是個　形工廠區，該廠肇建於民國十一年，最早爲中德商人合辦之震　電機廠製造廠，原計劃製造發電機，十二年電廠完成，開始發電，供常錫兩縣民用。十七年以營業不振，迭起糾紛，政府循地方公團之請收歸國有，隸屬建委會。二十六年中央決議將該廠轉讀揚子電氣公司民營，淪陷期中，爲敵侵佔八年，深受損害，勝利後，初由經濟部接收，不久即發揚十公司經營，名義是官商合辦。</p>
<p>設備一斑</p>
<p>現有錫爐六座，一二三四號係德　柏葛Babcock　＆　Wiocox石出品，為震華舊置，蒸發量每小時各十噸。五號亦為同廠品，蒸發量三十噸，六號爐為雷利Riley出品蒸發量五十噸。發電機有汽輪式四座一二兩號容量每部三千二萬　西門子出品，惟已年老。現作預備機用。三四　　為　吉Aeg出品容量三號三千二百　，四號七千五百　。又新置有流動型發電機一部，　茂　出品，容量二千五百莊，此機全部裝製在列車式架上。式　新型，本爲戰時產物，便於　時搬動。該　另建新屋以容之。其他如運煤，給水等設燭，均屬完全。</p>
<p>電力灌漑</p>
<p>每日發電總量約二一〇，〇〇〇度以上，除以「光明」照遍常錫丹人民，以動力轉旋各業工廠的輪子外，最足稱道的，是推行電化幾田灌溉，直接造福農民，若說中國有TVA運動的話，戚廠無欵是個始創紀錄者，民國十三年，即行試辦，灌溉地區初限於常錫兩縣。十九年建委會以認茲事體大會專設機構司其事，範國日廣，二十七年電通展至丹陽，該縣農田一部亦趨電化，是項工作，頗爲艱巨，即在淪陷期間，亦未中斷。迄今規模已具，農民稱便，成效卓著，常錫丹三縣　電力戽水站共一二八站，受益田畝三縣共約計十四萬三千餘畝，常州近水樓台　站多至九二處，受益田畝達七萬餘畝，該廠趙光宇氏主持此事　劉甚多尤足稱道，惟目下供求相距甚遠尙望該廠努力。</p>
<p>中農業務</p>
<p>中國農民銀行常分行，這一年來對於增進農村福利，扶植生產，工作甚爲積極，　凡肥料貸款，水利貸款，蠶絲棉布貸款辦理不遵餘力，該行農貸部主任陳君模在主持人鄔光謨領導下，日夕奔波於城鄕，苦心計劃精密組織，博得農民異常好感，咸呼爲福音使者，尤爲難能可貴。他所辦的棉布產銷合作，貸款與農民購買布機，購買棉紗，織布，在南門外湖塘橋一帶鄕村，差不多家家布機，戶戶織布，以是常州棉布產量日出三萬餘匹，布機二萬餘台，日需用紗三百餘件，是項農村織布，實占軍要部份，農村織布之輸血工作，周　靈活，中農　盡了最大的友誼。</p>
<p>水利援助</p>
<p>常州在過去灌溉事業頗發達，惟抗戰的過程中，遭受破壊甚烈，中　在此，作有計劃的先行恢復原有設備，再圖遂漸推進與擴展，人力方面會同各鄕鎭農會合作社以及水利協會組織機構，專司其事，電力站本年度恢復三十站，所需設備計方棚，船式磚房，馬達，皮帶，水帮浦，水管，變壓器，電表等。電力站是仰給戚廠供電，如果電力送不到處處，則改用機器戽水，機器站，在中農協助下，本年恢復三十三個。其重要設備爲機船，或磚房，柴油動力機，帮浦皮帶，水溝等，馬力最大爲三十匹，最小十八匹，該行貨款，指定專用於購買或修理馬達，方棚，桿綫，引聲，水帮浦，電表爲限，以上兩種全部器材當時價共計十九　左石，該行按照六成貨放計共十一億六千餘萬元，其餘則歸農民自籌，事先並派員會同農民團體代表至滬訂購，行內根機訂貨單核付。以防流弊，自籌都份電力戽水，每畝先交穀五十斤，機器每畝敢一萬元，自籌資金連同貸款大部用諸購置設　，餘則用之於　費油料什支之類，經濟是相當的淸楚和公開。</p>
<p>農民受惠</p>
<p>利用機器力戽水，免除辛苦的勞力，農民是極端的稱便，同時本年度實施情形下，灌漑田畝共有四萬三千一百二十七畝，廬接受惠豐民六千二百七十餘人，就經濟觀點看，如用人工戽水，以每架四人管理，每季灌溉四次，則四萬三千除畝田，每季工資至少要三十五億元以上，而改用電力與機器用費二億元已足，可節省盡在三十三億元以上，同時以灌溉得宜適時，稻苗生長長好，依專家估計，最低每畝可增收殺半石，以四萬三千餘畝計可增收毅在二萬一千五百石以上，以時價每石三十五萬元一石計，可增溢七十五億元以上，無怪一般農民對中農之協助感謝不已，三十七年度該行正謀擴展業務中，尙望是項有關國計民生之實際工作，政府作强力支撑使其高度發展，則農村建設，國家建設，一切均不再落空。</p>

<p>聯大重視科學合作</p>
<p>據稱：聯敎大會於科學硏究極爲重視，決繼承前年巴黎大會計劃：　在南京，巴西，及埃京，開羅，各設科學合作辦事處。該項辦事處業於去年正式成立，本年將在印度籌設。　本年在南美巴西亞馬孫河口之阿曼松（Amazon）地方，設立科學研究所，從事地質，氣象，動物等研究。　在中國及印度設立營養中心，此中心與世界農業及糧食組織發生聯系。　他如便利科學家旅行，交換敎授與學生，及加强科學刊物流通等，皆爲聯敎大會所討論而須執行者。李氏會後除在美國參觀外，歸程復在東京勾留一週，考察日本科學研究工作。</p>
<p>日本埋頭硏究科學</p>
<p>李博士稱：　日本第一印象，即戰時轟炸猛烈，東京及橫濱，什九被炸，證明日本已無力應戰，即不投擲原十彈亦必投降。　參觀東京大學（即前東京帝大）規模宏大，「物理」「化學」「工」「農」各學院，房舍集中，設備完善。　參觀物理研究所，該所戰時大部被炸毀，現原子物理禁止研究，原有原十分裂器二，及大阪另一分裂器，均已拋沉大海。所農任科博士篇“本原干物理學　家，極負聲　。　東京帶大之航空研究所，說更名東京大學理工研究所，設備良好，規模亦大，除航空部門外，現仍繼潑工作，研究不輟，航空之風洞原有二十，現尙留存口裡較小者三，此外並參觀小林物理研究所，亦在機　工作中。李氏又稱：日本戰後頗爲窮困，但於此艱苦環境中，科麽家於研究工作仍能積極進行，此種苦幹精神極令人欽佩。余唐日科學家，大學校長，及文部省大臣森戶，渠等均極稱崇聯會團文敎組織，日本極希望參加，曾搜集有關聯敎大會各種材料，彙算成册，日本科學家表示在科學硏究方面希望與我國合作，將來和約成立，吾人目亦同意，惟此乃將來問題。返顧我國目前之設備殊嫌不足，固不能與英美媲美，方諸日本亦不無愧色。今後吾人應有一安定及設備充分之科學研究環境，則目前在國外研究之中國科學家亦必及早言旋，我科學研究，必有較進步。</p>

<h3>大公飽受虛驚　力戰勝靑白　二十餘分鐘相持不下結果五十九比卅分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚籃球聯賽，常勝軍大公隊飽受廠驚，幾爲靑白所窘，體育館三千觀衆，大出意外。上半時大公僅以一分佔先，二十比十九。下半時五分鐘內，分數仍此起彼落。全局靑白會超出四次之多，直至各廿五分後，大公才脫穎而出，扶搖直上，結果五十九比三十三分。。</p>
<p>靑白力拼</p>
<p>昨晚情况，原因爲：大公出征南京，征塵甫卸，沿途勞苦。上塲練習時間不足，天時寒冷，多少帶些輕敵之意。一入逆境，愈打愈悶。育白人釘人，拼命全力看守，人高便宜不少。上半時靑白投籃，順利異常。及下半時各廿五分後，靑白劇戰，精疲力盡，大勢遂去，靑白體力長力不如，大公確有把握，其後妙球遂如聯餘而來。</p>
<p>僅多一分</p>
<p>初時雙方堅持不下，球在籃圈上滾旋，急壊了全座球迷。五分鐘緊張局面，僅成四比三，大公領前一分。不久成九比三，靑白老將王南珍徐亭等，投籃機會雖少，但發無不中，漸成均勢，迨蔡演雄托入時，竟成十二比十三超出，大公瞠目息戰。十三比十七時，落後四分之多，唐實堃犯滿離塲，由局達雲入替，一瞬間大公追成十七平手。上半時大公以二十比十九倖得佔先。</p>
<p>脫穎而出</p>
<p>演雄罰中，下半開始成各二十平手，少卿增一分，靑白再領先。大公蔡連科投入，不久又成廿二廿四廿五平手，戰况愈烈。大公擲中得二分，連科罰中，廿八比廿五後，從此一帆風順，卅九此廿五，　十四分之多。靑白由汪均炳卓國榮生力軍二人上塲，無奈陣綫零亂，已成强弩之末，回天乏術，終了五十九比三十三，靑白後勁不繼而敗。</p>
<p>其他二場</p>
<p>昨晚其他工塲：　甲二B組，甲申四十七比卅四勝V隊，甲一組汕隊大勝美憲兵，六十九比卅六。甲申三前鋒投擲準確，體魄高大，上半時廿四比十，下半時競爭甚烈，甲申卒以四十七比卅四勝利。汕隊陳淸江何立德瘋狂進壤，得分最多，上半時卅一比廿四。下半時汕隊毫不容情，結果以六十九比卅六大勝。</p>

<p>晨開時尙形堅定，惟遞交開出已吿平和，是以永紗現遞都以七六五元之價上塲，賣到七五二元及七五五元低價，反賣爲買，塲外喊價拾高至八百元外，而漲到七八五元及七九七元。以脫手者多，回低至七六七元及七七五元，塲外息價開高至三角及三角四分半，銀根告緊，但人心則好。市價在七七〇元及七八〇元左右，呈拉鋸狀態者甚久，旋升至七八〇元及七九〇元外，近午曾退至七六〇元及七六八元低價，午收回升至七六八元及七八五元，結果較前收即交股統益五和升半成，麗安跌成半，餘股升降俱微。遞交股信和平平，永紗勤興微升，餘均小挫。</p>
<p>後市上塲時以港電之長和縮，頗有出入而現不定，永紗初升至七八八元及七九七元，不久退至七七〇元及七七四元，國行交換差進甚多而有盤。後以美有停止援華訊，買戶異常急烈，乃漲到八二〇元及八二三元高價，趁高脫手而有回，但中絲掛漲停，收市永紗爲八一九元及八二一元。結果較晨收即交股中絲漲停，永公永紗新光景福勤興商務升半成，中法統益漲一成，餘均微升。遞交股永紗美亞景福各漲半成，餘均微升，塲外各未上市股仍見生色。老股以大生一廠，及交通銀行最俏，各昂一成。</p>

<h3>釋「回施」</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>文潮月刋十二月號載王季思先生之「西廂五劇注補正」，於其元著，多所修葺，皆審籌可佩。其中有涉及「回施」一語者云：</p>
<p>『「早成就了幽期密約」條，王伯良本此句作「和尙每回施些幽期密約」，當從山谷詩「病來十日不舉酒，回施靑春與後生。」任注：「回施蓋用佛家語，劉禹錫詩：無限歡娛榮樂事，一時回施少年人。」』</p>
<p>按「回施」誠佛家語，山谷詩出於劉禹錫，然也。西廂句則未必逕用山谷詩。宋人集中頗有甩此辭者，亦當時語耳。姜白石送楊誠齋詩云：「先生只可三千首，回施江東日暮雲。」祠堂本作」回拖江東日暮雲」，洪陔華本作「回首江東日暮雲」，皆已不得其辭，遂爲妄改。</p>
<p>陶朱不新錄記「河南潁陽縣北十五里倚箔山有洞若三間屋，中有潭，水深不可測。居此者率不過月餘，必有怪，恐怖而去。後有一儈來住，一日誦法華經於案，忽澤水動，但以爲雨候。俄一白蛇出水中，其大如梁，由僧之前，右繞盤於其左，其高如椅。僧張　恐怖，入室閉開。潛窺間，僧無如之何，乃厲者曰：龍王之出，必欲聞經，老僧為龍王講此一品。旣終，回施甫畢，蛇由福逕右繞入潭中。」</p>
<p>據此則所載，回施似本為一種佛家儀注。講經旣畢，例當回施。高九萬七夕詩云：「雙星回施兒童等，容我長齋繡彿前。」又閒居雜與云：「風和花氣淸，下簾休放出，回施佛因果，供此老詩骨。」又葉景文淸暉亭僧舍詩云：「上人回施淸閒供，蘭芷香中着茗甌。」此皆南宋人詩中用回施語者。姚牧菴燭影搖紅詞曰：「願靑軒流光緩綫，借諸任袖，回施新齋。」則元人猶用此語。華亭釋元龍乞貪詩云：「說經酬飯價，回施合凡情。」則淸初人詩中猶用此語。蓋俗家以財物施僧，個取之不藍，以其殘餘還諸施者，殆即回施之義。今杭州人歲時餽遺，率皆　返少許，名曰「回捨兒」，當即「回施」之　轉。由此可知「回施」即「回贈」「報答」之謂。源出佛家，其義可知，其儀則不可知矣。</p>
<h3>蠻王洞　嘉州記遊</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>關乎這蠻王洞有人說是漢　。在沒有方法考證它的是與非之前，當做奇怪的地方來探視，我覺得也未嘗不是有趣的事。聽說，嘉州城外西北的郊野，有更大的權王洞，我和朋友，藉作晴秋的散步，從田野間走去，經過若干小溪和木橋，在農村的後面，低阜的脚下，尋到了蠻王洞。</p>
<p>這是一種原始人類居處的構造，在石山的側面，鑿石而成洞，洞門是方形，許多洞的高和廣，大約在三丈和一丈之間，洞口石上，大都鑿出了花紋，有的鑿出了桌面大小的洞名，這不用說，是後來好事的人的花樣。有些洞裏面，石壁上鑿出了浮彫式的人物，從那模樣和拔法上看，也可以辨出他的幼稚來。</p>
<p>經過一所喂牛的木屋，從許多條遮道而立的水牛的身邊走過去，遠遠便望見，蠻王洞黑　　地立在山上，從土　的斜道爬上去，看見了這些洞的眞相，它純樣是就着那山上的黃石　鑿成的，其所以並未全被樹木蓋住的原故，是因爲已經成為「古蹟」，許多後人常到這裏來探勝，正像沒有當理的古廟，在門的用圖，長滿了葛藤和古草。</p>
<p>我走上土坡，去探視着來較爲堂皇的一個洞，「白雲洞」三個險文的巨字，刻在洞口的石壁，這是爾個洞門並排而立，其實裏面是敞然相通的一個洞，在石頭的六合之中，是　事般大小的一個地方，石壁上有不少的碑刻，我想從此碑刻的文字上尋出這沿的歷史，但那些文字，僅是後代人到此遊覽的記載，和洞的本身實在無關。我惘然失笑我自己的愚痴，覺得我和這些留名記事的巳作古人的唐宋人一　，無從知道這洞的來歷，我想，知道這洞的來歷的人，決不會認識這些隸書和正楷，因為，在這種文字產生之前，這洞大約已經在不知道多少年前鑿成了。</p>
<p>這洞的後壁，像戲台上兩個備人出入之門般，有分立左右的兩個較狹小的洞，這洞的裏面是兩條深遠的穴道，穴道的深處，顯然是向下斜下去，尙有地方，我想走進去，但是恐怖止住了我的腿，我雖然猜想那裏面不會有什麽野獸，但一個人獨立在這荒山的石窟漢，許多的想像，實在使我不敢再進去。在我走過的石地上，裂開了一條石縫，看出石地的下面，還有石室，而且有似乎是用作貯水之用的近乎石匣之狀的石的　成物。每個洞口的壁上，有深刻進去的石窪，看來是作爲嵌入木櫍之類的用處，石門的方權的外緣，刻出了簡單的圖案，令人想見，當初以此為室的人類，對於起居的地方，也曾精心的設計，而這洞的全體的構造，竟是後來中國房舍的雛形。</p>
<p>這個洞口特別的種了幾本芭蕉，我很奇怪，這種後代人的庭園的設計，爲什麽會加到這荒洞的門口，後來據朋友說，這是抗戰期間一位軍官在此避轟炸的遺物，碧綠的芭蕉，旣可以掩護洞門，又可以避暑，軍官就將這洞當作避險的地方，或者正可以硏究孫吳兵法和步兵操典，我們這個民族的遠祖，實在為後代子係打算得過於週到了。</p>
<p>繞過這個洞的山脚，相距半里地的附近，有更大的一個洞，一面很大的石壁光滑地立在同樣光滑的石坡上，鑿出了三個幾乎是城門大小的洞，遠遠望去，實在有城門的感覺，但是這個已經被土坡塞住洞口，連那裏面僅能看見的方形的洞門，也給土堆掩住了，這洞的裏面，有些怎樣的構造，實在不得而知，這洞和那門口有芭蕉的洞，正各立在山的一面，我猜想，這兩個洞的裏面，或者有相通的處所，如果考古家肯在這裏發掘，或者有相通的處所，如果考古家肯在運裏發掘，或者會發見許多歷史上的證件來。</p>
<p>除了這兩處較大的洞，附近一帶的山上，這樣的較小的洞很多，從這些洞的形態上，可以幻想古代穴居處的情形。現在，這些洞已經平埋在荒山，遊倦之後，離開這些荒山重新走回去的時候，望見今日之郊原和城市，我好像向上拉長了我的壽命，在歷史上散步，置身於古今之間了。</p>
<h3>荔枝詩</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>「長安　望　成堆，山頂千門次第開，一騎紅　妃子笑，無人知是荔枝來」。此杜牧之筆淸宮時也。按新唐書楊貴妃傳：妃嗜荔枝，必欲生致之，乃置騎傳送，走數千里，味未變，已至京師。杜詩蓋即咏此。老學庵筆記載宣和中保和殿下種荔枝成實，徽廟，手摘以賜燕帥王安中，且賜以時曰：「保和殿下荔枝丹，文武衣冠被百　，思與廷臣同此味，紅　飛　過燕山」，末句即用杜意。</p>
<h3>呼聲</h3>
<p>— 波蘭A阿思尼克作　陳玫譯</p>
<p>在暴風爾之外不時有一個呼聲</p>
<p>飄給那些無思慮的邪僻的肥耳。</p>
<p>飄給那些奴役於謊騙的首領，</p>
<p>一個在荒野裏作崇的呼聲。</p>
<p>牠刺入心房像一個鷔愕的思緒，</p>
<p>但沒有一個人從床上躍起；</p>
<p>人們戰憟一下，像剛才就逮的殺人犯，</p>
<p>但毫不注意那呼聲說些什麼。</p>
<p>因爲沒有一人能暸解或聽懂</p>
<p>那在風景外呌嘯的呼聲；</p>
<p>他們一翻身又軟綿綿地沉睡，</p>
<p>也不曾夢到懺悔與改過。</p>
<p>亞當，阿思尼克（Adam　Asnyk　1838-1897．），波蘭詩人。生於卡里茨，在華沙與德國海代堡學醫，業成後即在勞城行醫，一八七〇年後，在克拉柯城應診。業餘作詩，多偏於哲理，一般讀者均以爲陳義太高云。此章譯自「波蘭抒情詩金庫」，寇康耐爾編，加拿大波蘭印書館出版。</p>

<h3>讀田寄翁畫</h3>
<p>— 伍蠡甫</p>
<p>山陰山水名家田寄翁的畫學，畫品，和作畫的經過，已有黃華表兄一文介紹過了。我昨天到中國畫苑去參觀寄翁的畫展，覺得他的作風近於明末淸初數家，尤富於綜合力量，現在試來分析一下，這也是一種讀畫的方法，値得和鑒賞藝術的人共同討論的</p>
<p>寄翁佈局同十分繁密，畫面不多空白，取法麓台石谷者多，內中脈絡淸楚的，近於麓台，特意鬆散的，近於石谷。寄翁的用筆，約分三種，一種趨於沈厚，層次很多，是法龍半千，一種力求鋒利健實，則近藍田叔；一種意在疎秀，而多稜角，頗類王石谷。至於設色，則以淺绛爲主。</p>
<p>這幾位明淸大家的面目，寄翁已在他作品中給予一個調和融會了，而其主要的憑藉，則是點法，他的點以仲圭爲法，偶用二米，例如春山欲雨巨幅，上半雲山重疊，純用米點，下半松石流泉，專學蜨叟，而能氣象渾成，確非易事。至於我所最喜歡的，乃是兩張小幅，一學麓台的湖莊春曉，一學雲林而兼法湘碧的汀岸遙岑。</p>
<p>這樣的分析，也許很機械的，還望寄翁和鑒賞家予以指敎。</p>
<h3>在泥淖中</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>在都市的泥淖中，我是一個靈魂的受難者。</p>
<p>像一條失去了水的魚，在無星無月的冬夜，我深深地陷入罪惡的泥淖裏，雖然良心還沒有昏睡，可是我早已塗得滿身的泥漿了。吞着骯髒的爛泥，我隨着那些善於鑽營的泥鰍，在泥淖裏翻騰，找尋營養的滋料……就這樣活着，苦痛而又無可奈何的活着—</p>
<p>我底筆早已不爲我底心靈在我底稿紙上來灌溉了，因爲那良知的泉源，也混濁得沒有水滴成爲泥泉；啊！我這不可汲飲的良心的泥泉呀，做爲一個不甘自溺的我，能够永遠爲着斗米升粟之累，而長此墮落下去麽？</p>
<p>然而，夜是如此的深沉，沒有一顆星來陪伴着我，沒有鷄啼犬吠的太平景象，我縱然看得多也想得更多，我將如何運用這枝枯筆呢？</p>
<p>在都市的泥淖中，我　　良心的燈到處漫遊，我照見　苦痛的沉　裏的人們，是怎樣麻木不仁地生活着，我不能不資備自己為得太不夠了。</p>
<p>本來一個能够從觀察裏　視人生的人，他底思想的火花，永遠是烟　着的，而他底智慧的泉源，也永遠不會涸竭；我自己一向是以能够思想的人自許和自期的，然而在這樣一個泥淖裏，便因着偶然的「陷入」，弄得良知的果源成爲汚濁，不用說從這裏汲取水來灌溉，就連我自己也不願意來汲飲一滴了。</p>
<p>我無可奈何地在這泥淖裏翻騰，我看見那些華麗的衣衫上塗着厚厚的泥漿的「鑽營者」，是怎樣用肺來呼吸的，然而，事實上我也被迫着這樣去呼吸，不用靈魂去體驗，而用嘴去感受。</p>
<p>從這一小點的感受裏，我懂得一部份人們是怎樣的生活了。他們是陷入得越深同時痛苦也就越更來得大，同時，也更發不出聲音，因爲泥濘的良心再也沒有什麽反應了，就像一條泥鰍，原本是冷血動物——</p>
<p>因此，我沒想都市是一口大鍋，在沸騰的泥水裏，這些受難的泥鰍們彼此忍受着苦痛而又互相排擠着，也許有人認爲他們發不出苦痛的聲音，就認爲對於這種生活甘之爲飴那是錯了，我知道他們之所以沒有聲音，正爲着這是一個不允許有聲音的時代。</p>
<p>就這樣永遠也沒有聲音發出來麽？我相信那是不會太久了的，泥鰍原本也有發聲的器管的，而且翻騰的力量雖然微弱，終於也會因着傾榨過甚，而將這只大鍋弄翻了的。是的，那時人們將朝着沒有烈火的地方走去，而道路也就道樣被人們用脚跌踏出來。</p>

<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>白朗特的新硏究</p>
<p>最近英國對於女作家白朗特（Bronte）似乎頗感興趣。先騙出版部（Pilot　Press）出版了「白朗特姊妹小說集」（Novels　by　the　Bronte　Sisters），價十六先令。內收蔡洛特（Charlotte）的「琪恩·伊爾」（Jane　Eyre）和愛美萊（Emily）的「暴雨山荘」（Wuthering　Heights），和安尼（Anne）的「愛格尼斯·格雷」（Agnes　Gray）。</p>
<p>班特萊（Phyllis　Bentley）自己也是約克那（Yorkshire）的小說家，替英國小說家　書寫了一本「白朗特姊妹」。首叙她們的家庭環境和敎養，後來分別叙述她們的生活作品，結末叙這可　　的家族在英國文學中的地位。</p>
<p>她們是可讚美的三位能幹果斷的蔡洛特·奇特的愛美萊以及溫和處敬的安尼。現代也有這樣的三位，那就是席瓖爾（Sitwell）一家有愛狄斯（Edith），阿斯博特（Osbert）沙契維里爾（Sacheverell）三姊妹。</p>
<p>在白朗特家庭裏，我們不會忘記白南維爾（Branwell）。他們的父親生了六個孩子，就只有白南維爾是兒子，其餘五個都是女兒。大姊二姊都死得很早，三妹就是蔡洛特，白南維爾是老四，愛美萊老五，安尼老六。白南維爾雖也是作家和藝術家，却沒有多大的成就。他是這家族的失敗者，一個最軟弱的人，只帶給家庭慚愧和憂傷。他酗酒也許是爲了他自慚趕不上姊妹們的天才吧？沒有白南維爾，她們也許寫不出傑作來吧？蔡洛特會這樣能幹而且自信麽？愛美萊會達到失望和憐憫的深度麼？最誠實而又仁愛的安尼會在Wildfell　Hall寫那個慢性自殺的醉漢麽？奇怪的是白南維爾釣確是她們天才發展的需要；沒有他，也就沒有傑作的產生。</p>
<p>班特萊曾追尋白朗特姊妹文藝開花的踪跡，說她們本來是塞爾特族（Celt）人，後來移居到約克郡的。班特萊說她們雖寫的是約克郡的事，態度却是塞爾特族的。她們寫她們所知道的約克郡，寫得不能再好，但她們帶給我們的，却是愛爾蘭傳統的「感傷·詩歌·火和冰。」這本傳記材料豐富，記載翔實·她注重這家庭奇眞的夢的世界的重要，又寫出她們作品中的許多來源。</p>
<p>郞氏的「英國文學」云：『蔡洛特（1816-1855）要想把她的小說作爲社會寫實的描繪，她在薩克萊的寫實主義以外，加上熱情的本質，再帶一點不大平衡的浪漫主義。後者的本質一半是蔡洛特自己本性的表現，一半是她孤寂憂傷生活的結果，這種生活因了接通不斷的家庭悲劇變得更加黑暗。這將帮助我們了解她的作品，如果我們記得蔡洛特和她的妹妹愛美萊轉向文　是爲了她們感到她們做敎師的工作難受，要想創造一個幻想的新世界，解除她們自己命運的寂寞和憂傷。但是，在這新世界裏，想的憂傷還保存着，於是一切蔡洛特的小說後面都右痛苦的心。蔡洛特量好的著名作品是「琪恩，伊爾」（1847），不管它有缺點，是對於本質的愛和恨有力的硏究，使我們彷彿馬洛（Marlowe）的悲劇。這作品立刻傳到公衆的讚許，作者於是被列爲生存作家的前列。在小說本身的價値以外，有趣的是前面幾章反映作者自己的生活和經騐。「休萊」（Shirley，1849）和「維萊特」（Villette，1853）是這天才婦人常在人念中的三部小說」。郞氏又說愛美萊（1818-1848）的「暴雨山莊」是寫强烈的病態戀愛和忍受的。安諾德（M．Arnold）稱她寫熱情，大力和憂傷，除　倫外，無人能及。蔡洛特在小說「休來」中對於愛美萊有精細的描繪。</p>
<p>（白朗特畫像）　英國國家博物院藏</p>
<p>托馬斯曼寫摩西</p>
<p>德國托馬斯曼（Thomas　Mann）在努力重創約瑟及其弟兄的故事以後，現在又重創摩西的故事，在量上較小，在性質上却不無相似之處。這故事名呌「十誠」（The　Tables　of　the　Law）。原文刊於一九四五年所出版的，各家所撰述的結集。英譯是最近方纔出版的。</p>
<p>他用理性來寫摩西和摩四十載的成立，不參雜一點神話的成分。摩西是法老之女的孩子。所有神奇或半神奇的事，托馬斯曼都給予理性的解釋。</p>
<p>他憑着他的想像說摩西有一點點鼻頭，說話帶一點口吃，兩臂腕力甚强。一向托馬斯曼的作品籌成英文德不大有强烈的刺激，但現在這種小說的譯文却比較地流暢。譯者惜未署名，他利用美國的方言成語，使得這故事活潑起來。</p>
<p>屠德的新詩集</p>
<p>屠德（Ruthven　Todd）是英國戰時露頭角的新詩人。他以前出版過詩集「直到現在」（Until　Now，1942）和「心田」（Acreage　of　the　Heart，1945），又出過小說「失踪的旅人」（The　Lost　Traveller，1944），並曾在主編過詩人勃萊克的傳記（一九四二）。現在他又出版了這一本「在我手裏的行星」（The　Planet　in　My　Hand）。他富於敏感的表現力。他相信「人」雖易於發生悲劇，但也有他的偉大力量。他常歌詠到他的戀愛，他的兒子和他的父親。他的「紀念爸爸」云：「當我最後看見他，不安的躺在牀上，我知道我終於成人長大。只要我一想起他，一切我的仇恨和恐懼便都消失」。</p>
<p>他也有詠史詩如史維夫特之類，但他最好的詩　是「一九四〇年在愛丁堡」。</p>
<p>他常感　幻　和不安。大戰初　時，他曾悲苦她吟　　「我向仲夏月申訴，我在　　　能幹些什麼呢？我想　避歷史的　　，能逃到哪兒去呢」？</p>

<h3>上海廣播無綫電事業之今昔</h3>
<p>— 施應痒　錢志喜</p>
<p>發軔時期</p>
<p>溯自歐美各國硏究無綫電學者對廣播無綫電之試驗於一九二〇年（民國九年）宣吿成功，廣設電台，播送節目，成效舊著。越二年（民國十一年），始有英籍猶人奧斯篷（E．C．Osborne），在上海廣東路大來洋行裝設五十瓦廣播電台一座，自定呼號爲ECO，播送新聞演講音樂等節目。同時在南京路某眼鏡公司內附設電器公司（Electic　Equipment　&amp;　Co．），以廣播節目誘銷各種電氣器材.但電台機器簡陋，發音不淸，不能引起各界人士發生興趣，故不數月該電台及公司即吿收歇。至十三年後有美商開洛電話材料公司（Kellog　Telephone　Supplies　Company）經理迪萊（Delay），創設廣播電台一座，播送新聞商情，敎堂節目，名人演講，及該公司出品宣傳，電力自一百瓦增至二百五十瓦。至十六年，因獲利不厚而停播，然空中播音歷三年之久，爲上海廣播事業在發軔時期中之第一成功者。嗣後外僑相繼設台播音，計有　美（XMHA），其美（XQHE），大東（XQHA），英商奇開（即勞勃生電台）（XQHB），美靈頓（XQHC），法商法人（XFFZ）等六家。</p>
<p>國營及民營時期</p>
<p>至十七年，我國見西人廣播電台之猖獗漫無止境，乃開始自辦電台。先有前北京交通部及東北無綫電監督處，先後又立北京天津奉天哈爾濱等處電台。後有南京中央黨部，成立中央廣播事業管理處。初在首都設立强力電台，（自五百瓦增至五十啓羅瓦）繼及各省重鎭，設立分台，同時浙江省政府，亦設立一啓羅瓦電台一座，至廿三年，交通部亦設立一台（XQHC）以爲倡導。</p>
<p>政府領導於前，民營電台乃如雨後春筍，相繼設立。上海一埠，已達四五十家，惟各台機器優劣不一，互相干擾，於是交通部於廿一年頒布管理民營廣播無綫電台暫行取締規則，規定各台應先申請登記，聽候査臉機器，其合格者領得許可證後，始准設台開播。節目方面以宜揚敎育文化爲主旨，商業節目限制綦嚴，不得超過每日廣播時間十分之二。是時外僑電台幾經交涉，除法人電台一意崛强，不願登記外，其餘皆來登記。嗣美靈登其美兩台先後經交通部徽收撤銷。所有華商電台，機器方面由交通部派員檢查，節目方面交由中央廣播事業指導委員會審核辦理。數年來督薄之結果，各台機器尙能逐漸改進。惟缺乏良好節目，競以低級趣味之娛樂節目，吸引多家冗長之商業廣吿，而對於敎育演講及高尙娛樂節目，未見加重分量，至感惋惜。</p>
<p>抗戰時期</p>
<p>二十六年八一三抗戰軍興，喋血三月，國軍內撇，上海四十餘家民營電台，遂呈混亂狀態。外僑電台中華美奇開兩台於日寇侵入租界後停辦，大東電台出售於日寇，移設黃浦碼頭被盟軍飛機炸燬，法人電台因維希政權關係，仍繼續播音。華商電台不無貪圖營業，　顔事敵，繼續播音者，其後復有新設電台十餘家，一併爲日寇收買統制，惟麟記鶴鳴兩合因在南市戰區停播，其餘如上海（即亞美）元昌華美大中華大陸東方福音等台於國軍撤退後即自動停業。</p>
<p>勝利後整理時期</p>
<p>三十四年九月，抗戰勝利。在中央政府各機構復員尙未完成以前，廣播電台設置規則未奉行政院審　頒布，於是中西民營及黨　軍政機構，競設電台，數量日增，廣播　　，　佔擁擠，且機器大都　　　配，異常問題，以致波帮　　，互　　　，發音粗劣，不堪收聽。雖初由警備司令部及警察局臨時負責管理，卒以未有適合時宜之章則可資遵循，未收整理之果，迨至三十五年三月，本局始舉頒廣播電台設置規則，首先辦理公私電台登記，作爲初步整理。查各台遵令登記者計一頁〇六家，會由本局會同警備司令部警察局，派員分別實地查騐各台之發射機，及其播音設備等實况。但機器設備良窳不一，乃由三方面會同勘定等級，列表呈報交通部，經奉核暫准播音者，計中華，自由，亞洲，合作，金都，民聲，九九等六台。經飭改善機械後，暫准播音者，計中國文化，建成，大中國，大同，新聲，新滬，合衆等七台。又在抗戰期間不甘向敵偽登記，自動停業之電台，特准優先播音者，計大陸，大中華，東方，華美，元昌，鶴鳴，福音等五台。嗣又奉准播音者，計有新運大美兩台。以上二十台，均以每兩台合用一個週波，輪流播音，以减週波擁塞干擾之弊，另有新都一台，奉准僅供市參議會開會時播送會議節目之用，會議閉幕即行停止播音，又前中央廣播事業管理處所設之上海廣播電台，將改爲民營，隸屬中國廣播公司，現正在依法組織申請中。此爲光復後整理各台獲致空中秩序之大概情形。至於不法之徒，私設電台，專以濫招商業廣吿，冒銷劣貨爲牟利目的者，尙有多家，現正陸續偵察取締，不久可望肅淸。</p>
<p>今後之希望</p>
<p>夫廣播事業，爲宣導法令，發揚文化，啓迪民智之工具。常非徒以招　席業廣吿，企圖營利爲主要業務。而環顧今日，各台節目內容，大　　　　因，非特民黨電台頗多側　商業節目，即公營電台，私播商業節目者，亦屬不少。茲略舉數點，深望各台自動改進者如下：　節目方面。應側重敎育文化，關於敎育傳授，以及歌曲唱詞，音樂劇詞，等節目，務取禁高主義，雖通俗而不傷大雅，摒除一切有碍風化之穢襃詞曲，尤望敎育當局，出而協助整飭，以正風紀。對於商業節目，力求减低分量，目前商業節目。播送一播送一戶廣告，甚至有佔時達十分鐘以上者，三四戶廣吿同時播送，則佔時尤多，且播讀廣吿，詞句喋喋反復，竟如僧尼誦經，徒使聽衆厭倦，而改聽他台，於是廣吿之效力全失，而商家已受騙，枉費損失矣。昔交通部電台，簽收各種宣傳廣吿節目，每戶僅限播二分鐘，每半小時播送一次，每次同時限播三四戶，僅佔時六分至八分錢。今後各台似宜倣此，接收重質不重量之稱簡廣告，雖佔時短而收效大，如一意濫接冗長之廣吿，不受總衆注意，乃屬自欺欺人之舉，願各台有以改進之。　查各台機器，大都尙未盡精良，結果不能消除副波之　生，波幅之　擴，交流聲之喧囂，非特發苦不能悅耳，而互相干擾，亦爲常有之事。如技術方面，長此因循，不圖改進，聽任上海廣播電波　　無序，有碍國際觀聽，而貽邦家之羞。凡我無綫電技術界，亦自問慚　，尤願各台負責者，痛加警惕，注意改進焉。</p>
<h3>有話大家說</h3>
<p>— 蘇予</p>
<h3>談談海岸電台</h3>
<p>— 孫紀鐏</p>
<p>海岸電台—對於一般人士，除掉了輪船公司和少數人士外，好像比較生疏一些，因爲大家都知道電信局收發國內電報，國際電台收發國外電報，而海岸電台呢？却有些不大淸楚，到底是幹些什麼的，所以今天就把海岸電台的大概，介紹給諸位，想也爲諸位所樂聞的罷。</p>
<p>海岸電台—是一個在陸地上而專門和海洋及內河輪船（裝有無綫電設備者）通訊的機構，設立的目的，是爲了海上的安全，所以牠最大的任務，也是偏向海上安全方面，雖然也和電信局國際電台同樣地接受公衆通訊，收發來往船舶電報，然而這是次要的工作，牠底主要的特殊任務，大約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>守聽遇險信號　海岸電台的工作，是二十四小時制的，每一分鐘的注意守聽，除掉收發幾張電報以外，最神聖最緊要的工作，是守聽海上可有船隻（或飛機等）發出遇險求救信號，（SOS）如果聽到這稱信號，即使正在通報工作，也就立刻停止，共同靜聽遇險電文，（包括船名和牠的國籍遇險的日期時間和地點—經緯度—及遇險狀况）立刻通知各有關方面，如船公司江海關港務處等，同時代爲轉播，請求附近的船隻前往救援，直到出險爲止。</p>
<p>廣播報時信號和氣象預報　每天在規定時間，拍發報時信號，以便校對時刻，並且拍發氣象情報，以便航行船舶知道氣象的　化，在颱風季節裏，如有暴風發現，尤須時時廣播，使得在航行中的船舶知所趨避。</p>
<p>發航行警吿　海洋裏如發現危險航行的東西，隨時廣播如在戰時遣留下來的水雷，或者發現了暗礁，或者有漂流的障碍物，和沉沒的船隻等，還有在航路中的燈塔啊，浮標啊，發生什麽障碍移動位置，都要隨時拍發警吿，促使船舶注意以保航行安全。</p>
<p>航行動態報吿　每天各種船舶的進港出港，和航行的位置在什麽地點，有相距多少路程，都要紀錄下來，以備查考，同時也因爲這樣地和來往船舶保持着密切的聯絡，在交換電信時，便利而有把握。</p>
<p>疫情報吿　那個港口發生什麽疫病，需要檢疫，也要公吿周知，使上下旅客注意，如果旅客患病，也可由海岸電台轉交衛生醫藥機關解答。</p>
<p>廣播新聞求向測向　設備完全的海岸電台，還有這些設施，都是便利航行和增進海上安全的。</p>
<p>上面所述的各項任務，都是海岸電台的特種任務，完全免費，義務服務，並且大都提前辦理，普通電信，還在其次，所以牠們是服務（Service）第一，業務（Trafiic）第二，但是二者是有連繫性的，服務越周到，業務跟着發達，海岸電台的健全與否，影響航空至巨，　　設備必須力求完全，歐美各國　運發達。對於海岸電台，不但因　　是航行安全所關，也認為對內對外　　所繫，異常重視。</p>
<p>船舶電報　凡是海岸電台和船舶間，或船舶和船舶間來往的電報，都叫做船舶電輕，現分國際船舶電報和國內船舶電報兩種</p>
<p>國際船舶電報　這種電報　費的計算方式，也和國際電報一樣，按照金法郞計算，每個字九十生丁，內海岸費五十生丁，（按照現行法郞折合國幣率計算最近自本年十月十三日起調整爲每一金法郞折合國幣一萬八千元）船舶費四十生丁，不論華文洋文都一律，不過沒有「急電」這一類，倘使用密語CDE，照十分之六計算。</p>
<p>國內船舶電報　凡是本國船舶，經交通部核准發給無綫電台證書並呼號的，可照國內船舶電報價目計算　費，現行價目爲華文明語每字國幣一千五百元，內國內報費一千元，船舶報費五百元，洋文或密語加倍計算，加急電再照尋常電加倍計算，船舶費仍照尋常電計費。</p>
<p>我國現有的海岸電台，北方有天津XSV靑島XST營口XSD，中部有上海XSG，南方有台南XSW基隆XSX花連港XSY，沿揚子江上下游的江岸電台，有南京XSM九江XSK漢口XSN宜昌XSO重慶XSP等台，上海海岸電台的營業處，在本市長治路二五號，電話四四八八二—四五七四七。</p>
<p>正在籌設的海岸電台，有秦皇島XSV3胡蘆島XSV4烟台XSC連雲港XST3廣州XSQ汕頭XSQ3海口XSQ4福州XSL厦門XSL2永嘉XSL3寗波XSR2，江岸電台有杭州XSR鎭江XSM3無湖XSM4　XSG2長沙XSN3岳陽XSN4沙市XSO2萬縣XSP3這幾處地方。</p>
<p>我國人士對於船舶電報，除掉船公司外，普通人士很少利用，諸位假使有親友在輪船上航行的時候，要知道他行程何處，何時到達，或者有緊要的事情，要使他馬上知道，以及在輪船上作客的人，有事要和家屬或親友通訊，推而至於接洽公務啦，探詢商情啦，儘可拍發幾張船舶電報，由海岸電台給您忠服務實，那麽雖然重洋遠隔，天各一方，千里戶庭，無殊覿面，所謂「一點靈犀微彼通，」摔謂來電，恍如晤對一室之內哩。</p>

<h3>電信常識講話</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第三講　怎樣選用特別業務</p>
<p>上面三種特別業務的用處比較普遍。以下各種的用途比較狹些，爲節省篇幅起見，我們準備講得簡單一些</p>
<p>送妥通知　在沒有談到正題以前，請讀者們預先思考一下：如果我們交寄郵件，應該在怎樣的要求之下，纔用「雙掛號」寄遞？就筆者所知，英美各國（尤其是美國）因爲郵政本業認眞可靠，民間往來的郵件通常都用平寄，除非特別簡要，很少發寄「單掛號」信件，至於雙掛號信，除非發信人意欲取得雙掛號的回單作爲法律上的信物，更不輕易發寄。再拿處理電報的手續來說，發報人交發任何報類的電報，都得由發電局掣給電報回執（收據），電報如有投送不到　悄事，電局照章負有通知發報人的責任，在處現手續上，比較寄遞平信更爲週到，換句話說，凡電報發出後發報人幷未接到電局所發有關投送不到的通知，那就確證所發的電報確實已經送達無誤，儘可放心毋慮，所以，我們對於和「　　號」郵件的性質相彷的「送妥通知」特別業務，依據筆者個人的意見，認爲除非在：　發報人意欲取得「送妥通知」作爲法律上的信物，或　發往某地的電報由於特殊原因（例如收報當地因遭遇天災或戰亂，電信交通發生困難等等原因）經電局公吿發往那兒的電報如有延誤或傳遞不到單局不負責任等兩種塲合之下，發報人爲謹愼起見可以酌量選用「送妥通知」特別業務以外，通常幷無選用這種特別業務的必要。</p>
<p>送妥通知分爲送妥電知（標識PC）和送妥函知　（標識PCP）兩類。前者即收報電局於電報送妥後把送妥的日期和時間通知發報局轉知原發報人，送妥電知特別業務的費用是在原電本身報費之外，另照尋常電價目加付六個字的報費；後者係於電報送妥後，由收報電局將送妥日期和時間用郵偕通知發報局轉吿原發報人，除　　本身報費外，照郵局定衆加付單掛號信的邮資。</p>
<p>專送　電局投送電報，在原則上，並不收取送力，（特快電報例外）但投送給居住在離開市區或城區過於遙遠的地方的收報人的電報，電局必須加派專差遞送，所費人力較多，所以必須向收報人收取專力費。</p>
<p>每偶電局都有它的免費投送常報的區域範園，依照通常規定，几投送給市內城內或離開市區或離開城牆二公里以內的常報，都不收取送力。</p>
<p>几收報人居住在收報電局免費投送區域以外但距離電局所在地不出四十公里的任何地點的電報，如經發報人在電首註明「專送」或＝EXPPESS＝標識，收報電局可派專差遞送，否則收報電局在收到道張電報之後，除非居住在免費投送區械以外的收報人因平日來報較多事先約定自己派人每天定時向電局領取外，就一律交郵局遞寄，并不派差專送。</p>
<p>專力費照章須向收報人收取，從出發投送電報的電局或營業處起算，凡距離不超過十公里者收取專力費一個單位，十公里以上每加一至五公里加收一個單位。專力費的單價係根據當地小工每日工價的四分之一計算，所以各地電局收費的價目幷不相同。</p>
<p>根據上面的規定，當發報人準備發一電報至某收報人而明知這收報人住所係在收報電局的免費投送區城以外者，應該在事前參加考慮，如果深信收報當地的鄕村郵政投遞迅速，那就不必在電首加註「專送」標識，反之，如果認爲有要求收報電局派差專送的必要者，可在電首加註此項標識，不過近來工價易貴，專送費　根據工價計算，而且規定應由收報人繳付，所以在加註「專送」標識之前，同時必須顧到收報人的負担。</p>
<p>跟轉　發往正在旅行中的旅客的電報，最好選用跟轉特別業務。跟轉特別業務有兩種用法。第一種：發給正在旅行中的旅客的電報，如果預先知道他將要到達的地方和到達每一地方後準備居留的地址，但不能確定收報人現在已經抵達何地者，可把各到達地方的地名和住址逐一開列，並在電首加註「跟轉」或＝FS＝標識。例如：現有一位上海大衆銀行總行的總經理黃仁鳳從上海出發，分往該總行所　南京，漢口，重慶三分行視察業務，上海方面現有要事準備發電報給他，但不能確定收報人現在已經行抵那一地方，在這種塲合下，祇要在電首註明＝FS＝標識，並開列各地住址如下：</p>
<p>＝FS＝南京中山東路大衆銀行黃仁鳳＝漢口湖北路大衆銀行＝重慶中山一路大衆銀行＝（下接電文及署名）</p>
<p>當南京電局接到從上海發來的這張電報之後，立即向南京大衆銀行查詢收報人是否現在南京，如果已經離開，隨即將原電轉發漢口試投，漢口電局亦照上例同樣辦理，直到電報送妥爲止。（待續）</p>

<h3>哀金鈔階級</h3>
<p>— 孟農</p>
<p>埃及女皇克里奥巴特拉是以講究生活上的享受出名的。她喜喝特種葡萄酒，據說酒瓶底裏還盛着四顆珍珠。</p>
<p>古羅馬時代，帝皇們也極盡奢侈的能事。他們用孔雀的腦子和舌子做成的三明治，作爲食品。</p>
<p>可惜，今日的金鈔階級，憑你有多少金鈔，也享受不到這些了。因爲這是消逝了的時代。現在除了火腿三明治，牛肉三明治等之外，試問那裏享受得到孔雀腦三明治那樣的古董？你又何嘗能比你的大餐廚子多吃一份大餐呢？</p>
<p>再說，看戲是一種生活上的享受，穿衣也是一種生活上的享受。不錯，的確是享受。然而，你金鈔階級，能在同一個時間內穿上兩三套漂亮西裝和大衣嗎？能在一個晚上連看兩三家戲院的連台好戲嗎？</p>
<p>爲了你喜歡金鈔而希望你享受不必要的鉅大的財富，那是徒然的。這正如爲了孩子喜歡吃糖果而呌糖果廠的孩子每天多做兩小時工作一樣，因爲有了金鈔，畢竟未必能享受一切。一切非並金鈔就能買到或者享受到。這情形正如那糖果廠的孩子有糖果在廠裏而無法吃到一樣。</p>
<p>薪水階級則不然。如果能拿到加倍的薪水，其生活上的享受也就會加倍。每月一千萬元的收入，比五百萬元，在享受上，正是可以增加一倍。可是金鈔階級却不然。他每天把手中的金鈔滾，滾，滾，滾到他自己都無法正確地估計的鉅大的數字。然而這大量的金鈔，究竟與他的生活的享受發生了什麼關係沒有呢？我相信，自然的限制早已把人生的享受賦予了一定的限度，而金鈔階級正是高高的超越着限度以上，享受變成了幻想。他幻想着這個，又幻想着那個，像「天方夜談」中的玻璃商人亞爾納斯邱一樣，幻想着有這麽一天，討一個皇后一樣的妻子，並且要在她的面前，擺威風，搭架子，發脾氣，把她一脚踢出去。這一踢，可就　碎了自己的夢和幻想！原來他並不是踢在自己的「　后」身上，而正是踢在自己的財富（玻璃器物）上面，玻璃碎成片片了，一切的財富也就完了！</p>
<p>一隻金戒也許是可以裝飾你，但無數的金條就儘可能捆綁你，束縛你。一頓大餐可以飽你的肚子，使你獲取必要的營養，但如果吃了一餐再吃一餐，吃得太飽了，那就不僅沒法消化，恐怕連腸胃也得非吃壊不可吧。對於吃得太飽而傷了腸胃，坐了牢監的金鈔階級，試問有人會寄予任何同情嗎？相反的，値得憐憫或寄予同情的，還是那些露宿在寒風中的一點溫飽都無法獲得的窮苦百姓，連一部分薪水階級在內。多少被沒收了的金鈔是否將給苦難中的人們以一點應有的溫飽呢？——我在作這樣的想法。</p>
<h3>我不選擇自由</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>在報紙的畫籍廣吿中看到一本怪書，名爲「我選擇了自由」。不知內容如何，那人爲什麽要選擇自由？在那幾種東西中選擇的？若在鄙人，則假如有人在自由之外另列二樣東西，譬如說　　成砒霜吧，命我選擇，那我當然選擇自由，但若黃連砒霜換了年糕麵包，與自由並列，命我選擇，說老實話，可必舍自由而選擇年糕或麵包，假如這選擇是讓我自由選擇的話。</p>
<p>因爲古今所　啦　啦的自由，係指自由言論，自由　會，自由結社而言。自由戀愛自由結婚還不在內，自由吃麵包自由吃飯更是卑不足道，摒諸題外了，故我無意於選擇自由。原來在言論集會社會數大自由之中，後二者我根本討厭。集許多張三李四孫七黃八於一堂，公說公理婆說婆理，意見永難一致，結論絕不易得，廢時失業勞民傷財之外，一無是處，故我當說集會應列入節約之內，至少與報紙筵席同難。結社也是差不多的玩意兒，杭育杭育的結了之後，貢獻不會過於票友先在們用以「我好比」幾句的某社某社。</p>
<p>對於言論自由本來還有幾分。但近來興趣也差了，不久恐將索然。因爲我已覺得言論自由如指嘴巴說說的，我已足够自由，的天與家人戚友不知要發多少議諭，蒼蠅之大，宇宙之微，信口開河，隨意發言，有誰來禁止或干涉我過。倫　　　公園有各黨各派演說，世人　爲英國民主精種所繫。細思之實覺好笑。聽衆不比我的家人戚友爲多，存心又與我們之看街頭出把戲不相上下，况且歸根結蒂，海德公園的演說歷史儘管悠久，英國迄今還不是僅保守工黨二然再加上自由黨這條小辮子而已、有甚貢獻於國家天下？至於形諸筆墨的言論自由呢，我看事實是：你要自由發表宏論，自己去辦報紙雜誌則可，否則這份自由沒有你的分。因爲你想在主張不自由主義的報刊上發表提倡自由主義的大作固然困難，你要在提倡自由主義的報刊上宣揚反對自由主義的宏文又豈能得？原來某一社團或某一報刊所義正詞嚴力竭聲嘶而爭的自由，是該一社團或該一報刊的自由，與他們並非自己人的爾找是毫不相干的。古今中外，其例不一，看如不信，讀讀歷史。</p>
<p>故我不選擇自由，假如我愛選擇什麽也有自由的話。</p>
<h3>中國文法</h3>
<p>— 文介</p>
<p>中國文字，說他沒有文法，却也不是完全沒有，說他有文法，又說不出一個系統來。此或係未加細究之故。不過近人之言中國文法者多以英文法爲凖，以之繩中文，是亦容有未常。須知英文有英文文法，法文有法文文法，德文俄文有德文俄文之文法。言英文文法者初不以法德俄文之文法繩英文，言法德俄文文法者亦初不以他國文法繩法德俄文。然則言中文文法何得獨以他國文法繩之？</p>
<p>余意欲言中文文法，必以中文本身爲立脚點，然後再輔以他國文字之文法爲之參考，始可得中文文法之正。中文中有許多句法，若衡之以英文法，君去頗不合準繩，然而讀來却是「通」的。例如「像殺猪一般呌喊」一語，依照英文文法，勢必改作「像一只猪被殺時一般地呌喊。」又如「棒打薄倖郞」一語，純依英文文法解釋，此棒必是自動會飛的了。</p>
<p>推以言哲學，胡適著「中國哲學史大綱上卷」，以美國近代實騐主義爲準繩，以之評述中國哲學，學者頗多認爲此乃戴了有色眼鏡看中國哲學，病其未能得中國哲學之正。馮友蘭著「中國哲學史」便以某哲人之立塲言某哲人之哲學，蓋持「以經解經」原則者。陳寅恪評馮著說。「……所謂價了解者，必神遊冥想，與立說之古人處於同一境界，而對於其持論所以不得不如是之苦心孤詣，表一種之同情，始能批評其學說之是非得失，而無隔閡膚廓之論。否則數千年前之陳言舊說，與今日之情勢廻殊，何一不可以可笑可怪目之乎？」又說：「……今日之談中國古代哲學者，大抵即談其今日自身之哲學者也；所著之中國哲學史者，即其今日自身之哲學史者也。其言論愈有條理統系，則去古人學說之眞相慮遠。……」</p>
<p>推以言經濟，不以當的經濟局勢不身爲對象，而以幾套陳舊的「辦法」之類當作法實，則愈談經濟，經濟自然愈無辦法。以言政治，不以政治局勢爲對象以治政，惟知頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，政治自然愈攪愈亂。</p>
<h3>病中小記</h3>
<p>— 吉爾</p>
<p>寒流來而未來之際，迎風奔波的我，却傷風了。咳嗽時斷時續，心境亦非常之不寗，確是有些身心俱病了。</p>
<p>新年因病，高臥未起，一霎眼，米價已透一百五十萬元關，紅盤起處，百物狂漲，報章上又滿是耀眼的三角形。倒是今日同事相見，大家哈哈，都抱着司空見慣的心情。這種漠然的情緒，倒頗够悲哀。不過，事情總是有兩面，前天故鄕有人來，談及今年故鄕農民的生活，大感高興；據說今年鄕間市面特別好，百貨店中滿是鄕農，原來去年過年，需一担多米換絨綫一磅，今年過年，一担米可換絨錢二磅多。他興奮地說，這相差大了。我才恍然於「殺賤傷農」一語的含義。</p>
<p>上文並無有　　漲價之意，只是指出「人」的熙望是如何的各不相同。本來，大人有大人的希望，孩子們有孩子們的希望；　不家有資本家的希望，工人有工人的希望；商人有商人的希望，農民有農民的希望……又豈能有盡如人意的事呢？</p>
<p>久居都市的人，或不易明暸這個都市所依以爲「集散地」的各地人民的生活；所有接觸從各地來的人，似乎多是「難民」；其實在這廣大土地上安居樂業的人正多哩！譬如我的故鄕是在京滬，滬杭二鐵路間的三角形中，所謂魚米之鄕，千千萬萬的人都是農民，祗要有魚可捕，有米收穫，他們是頗能安居樂業的，今年沒有受砲火的摧殘，因此恢復了一點以前熙熙攘攘之氣，他們還是幸福的。</p>
<p>反觀我這窮公務員呢？眼觀各項公用事業都開始應用「自動調整」的公式——而仰望中的調整待遇，仍須三個月一次。病中無多望，但願以後一切都有一個「自動調整」的公式可以應用，那就身心俱安了。</p>
<h3>消遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　禍不單行（四一）</p>
<p>渚齋見她口口聲聲祗說等待，心裏有許多苦處，都不能說出口，祇唯唯答應。綺紈說後，也不再提這事，隨把在濟南路演經過的情形，吿訴渚齋，並說濟南露演後，還要到靑島露演一次，自已心裏本不願意去，爲了將來生活費打算，又不能不去，並說：「我希望在濟南靑島兩地演完後，所餘款項，能置一所稍講究的房子，並剩下錢來作生活費用，過個太平日子，那就好了。」渚齋見她興致勃勃，所說的話，都抱樂觀，更不便再說什麽，那天二人僅僅談了兩個鐘頭，鶴舟那邊已派人來催請好幾次，綺紈因爲有許多家務要和鶴舟商量，不能再躭擱，臨走的時候，祇叮嚀渚齋說：「我永遠記得那一晚的話，我等待你，想我這次出去，再回來時，我們的事情，早已解決了。」說着，握着渚齋的手，搖了幾搖，走了。渚齋回到家裏，覺得這事很不好措手。綺紈對他交情，已演進到此地步，不和太太離婚，也是不行，但是家裏自父親以次，對這離婚問題，一定都不贊成，一提由來，必定要全體反對，要辦這事，必須呌鳳笙自動提出離婚才好。鳳笙又是腦筋最頑固的女人，若沒受過相當刺激，絕對不肯有這種舉動。　爲人最沒主張，耳皮最軟，愛聽閑話，必須有人從中挑撥，才能釀出婚變，現在須利用什麽人呢，又是一個問題。想了許久，想到章雲卿身上。此次自己和鳳笙結婚，是雲卿最痛心的一件事，她私下對人表示終生不嫁，一往情深，是最可念的，此時若對她表示要和鳳笙離婚，她一定贊成，不如利用她在鳳笙面前挑撥，呌她自動提出離婚。等婚約解除之後，再提出一些條件，和綺紈商量，看她能不能接受？她若不能接受，我再和雲卿結婚，如此，對得住綺紈，也對得住雲卿。不過鳳笙雖然腦筋不淸楚，嫁我之後，並無過失，一旦把她拋去，於良心上，很是不安，必須給她一個較優條件，好呌她以後生活安定。渚齋為了這事，理欲交戰，整整想了一夜，第二日不由自主，跑到章雲卿家裏，一進門便唉聲嘆氣，坐在沙發上，祇是雲怔。雲卿見他如此，以為他在外面，又受了什麼閑氣，先送了一杯茶過去，挨着他在沙發坐下，很溫柔地，低聲細氣問道：「你今天爲什麼事，又不痛快了？」</p>

<h3>張浚與張俊</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜</p>
<p>余前述秦檜張王氏事於本報，語及張俊，「俊」字誤植作「浚」字，於是遂使此忠忱衛國之魏公張德遠（浚）無端而代久跪岳王墳前之張俊受過，不得不有一言以辨之。</p>
<p>按張浚雖宋人以其子張栻之故，推崇之甚至（朱熹爲張魏公撰神道碑，累累萬餘言，而宋史且比之爲諸葛武侯，謂其力阻和議，復仇之志之說，百折不回，無愧武侯「鞠躬盡瘁死而後已」之語也。）然後世亦有以其符離富平屢次憤敗，喪師無數，而加以庛議者。更有以其嘗荐秦檜，致巨奸當國，屈節求和，南宋不復再振，追溯禍始，而歸過魏公者。凝閱某刋物，當有人爲張浚力辯其誣，謂魏公志節，豈宜有此，此不讀史之故也。張浚誓復國仇，不與金人俱生，固當時之純臣，雖志之不遂，亦未可遽非。至迹其生平而謂斷無推荐秦檜之事，則張浚之汲引秦檜，明戰史册，不可掩也。「建炎以來繫年要錄」云：「詔行宮留守秦檜令赴行在所奏事，張浚以檜在靖康中建議立趙氏，不畏死，有力量，可與共天下事，一時仁賢荐檜尤力，遂推引之。」又「林泉野記」云：「檜知溫州，確碌碌無治聲，張浚爲相，上幸平江撫軍，浚以檜柔佞易制，荐入使備員，乃除行宮留守。」建炎要錄謂張浚以秦檜「不畏死，有力量，可與共天下事」而荐之，林泉野記則謂浚以檜「柔佞易制」而挽入政府，二說雖不同，而浚之荐秦檜，終事實也。惟林泉野記所云，恐近臆測，魏公決不至此，且秦檜自金逃歸，朝中震其忠義，荐之者甚衆，又不僅張浚一人而已。以趙鼎之賢，於秦檜且有「近與共事，方知其闇」之悔，秦檜後來之事，非始料所及，以此而責張浚私心誤國，張浚固有所不受。如此周內，故入人罪，則蔡京執政，致靖康之禍，亦可歸過溫公私心矣，蓋蔡京之入政府，亦由司馬光喜其能奉行新政而引進之也。又張浚尤以攻去李綱一事，最予人以口實，故朱勝非之秀水閒居錄於二人後來除前隙更相厚善，極口醜証，張浚頗以是損其生平。惟建炎要錄云：「浚綱初不相咸，其後相好，當以國事，而勝非直以勢力之交詆之，恐非其實。」斯平允之論也。要之，綜張浚一生，功過自足相抵，雖一再覆軍，未嘗勝敵，但吳玠守四川，力扼金兵，不失寸土，其始亦由於張浚拔用之，西蜀終賴玠以固，浚之功亦甚大，何得專以富平之敗責張浚，而略守川之功不以歸之也。至力阻和議，始終一節，宋朝繫之以安危，國勢積弱，尤不可無此一人。世之所以訾之者，充其至，亦不過「志大才疎」一語，此固何損於魏公？吾嘗謂南宋之能立國，幸前有宗澤，後有張浚，二人之力，而後世以「浚」之與「俊」字形近似，往往誤認爲一人，此魏公之不幸也。</p>

<h3>Adjusting Salaries for Civil and Military Personnel: The Executive Yuan Approves Implementation Measures, Effective Nationwide from January, Divided into Five Zones</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The six principles for adjusting salaries for civil and military personnel, passed by the 19th State Council meeting, have been put into implementation measures by the Executive Yuan, amended and approved at the 13th Executive Yuan meeting, and will be implemented from January. The content is as follows: (A) The country is divided into five zones in accordance with the principles decided by the State Council. The division is based on the indices compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. Areas with similar indices are classified into the same zone. Within a zone, a compromise index is adopted as the representative index. The difference between the index of each area within the zone and the representative index should not exceed 10,000 times. For example, the representative index for the first zone is 150,000 times, the second zone is 115,000 times, the third zone is 85,000 times, the fourth zone is 65,000 times, and the fifth zone is 52,000 times. Furthermore, due to the special circumstances of Taiyuan and Shenyang, they will be handled separately. They will be included in the general adjustment plan after they return to normal. The base salary for all civil and military officials is 30 yuan, calculated according to the cost-of-living index. Any amount exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. The salaries of technicians and laborers were previously determined independently by each agency before the war and there was no fixed standard. In recent years, they have been paid at 60% of the base amount. Now that the base amount has been abolished, salary scales for technicians and laborers of each agency will be formulated, divided into seven grades to match seniority and work ability, and salaries will also be paid according to the index. Those below 30 yuan will be paid according to the index, and those exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. The treatment of police officers will still be in accordance with existing regulations. Police chiefs will receive 30 yuan, and a certain amount calculated at 70% of the index. Police officers will receive 60%. Police chiefs in the six special municipalities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Qingdao will receive 90%, and police officers will receive 80%. The salaries of police chiefs and officers will be in accordance with the current salary scales for police chiefs and officers. For salary amounts exceeding 30 yuan, the amount exceeding 30 yuan will be paid at one-tenth of the index. (B) Due to the greater mobility of military officers and soldiers, their salaries were originally uniform nationwide. Officers were generally calculated according to the second zone standard, which was one level lower than the Nanjing zone. This time, it has been changed to be calculated according to the representative index of the capital Nanjing zone, which is an increase of 150% compared to the original salary. Soldiers will also be increased by 150%, the same percentage as officers. (C) The treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises (including national banks and bureaus) should strictly comply with the "Regulations on the Treatment of Personnel in State-Owned Enterprises." The total income of all allowances, including basic salary, cost-of-living allowance, special office expenses, food and lodging allowances, and the difference in kind distribution, shall not exceed 30% of the income of corresponding levels of public school personnel (including salary, cost-of-living allowance, special office expenses, and the difference in kind distribution in areas where kind distribution has been implemented). If there is a surplus at the end of the year, year-end bonuses may be issued, with the approval of the competent authority, in accordance with the "Regulations on the Issuance of Bonuses to Employees of State-Owned Agricultural, Industrial, and Mining Enterprises," up to a maximum of three months' salary. In addition, there shall be no extra treatment. The competent authority should effectively supervise implementation. (D) The "Implementation Measures for Transferring Surplus Salaries and Cost-of-Living Allowances of Various Agencies for Employee Welfare Purposes" will be abolished from January 1948. In the future, any surplus salaries and cost-of-living allowances from various agencies will still be turned over. (E) The special subsidies for faculty and staff of specialized schools and above in zones other than the first zone have been decided by the 19th meeting of the State Council in the general budget for the first half of 1948. They will be abolished after the revision of the "Measures for Adjusting the Salaries of Civil and Military Personnel" from January 1948. The original budget has also been deleted, and should be cancelled. (F) For civil service agencies, staff members and laborers (excluding technicians and police); for military agencies, officers and soldiers in rear agencies and troops, the total amount due should be reduced by 5% per month from February 1948 until June, when the cost-of-living allowance should be reduced by 25%. Each agency should independently plan and implement how to streamline its organization, merge institutions, or lay off redundant personnel, and report to the Executive Yuan for approval. Employees and laborers (excluding technicians) of state-owned enterprises should also be reduced according to the above standards, and the competent authorities should be responsible for submitting a list to the Executive Yuan in early each month. Late submissions will result in the suspension of subsidies. (G) Provinces and cities may adjust the treatment of civil, military, and labor personnel with reference to the central government's standards. If financial resources are truly insufficient, the central government will provide appropriate subsidies, and the measures for tightening expenses should be consistent with the central government's regulations.</p>
<h3>Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Belong to the Third Zone, with an Index of 85,000 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] After the "Implementation Measures for Adjusting the Treatment of Public Servants" were approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 13th, it was announced that the country would be divided into five zones. The first zone is Dihua in Xinjiang, 150,000 times; the second zone is Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei, 115,000 times; the third zone is Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu, 85,000 times; the fourth zone is Hankou, Guangzhou, South China, and Central China, 65,000 times; and the fifth zone is Chengdu, Chongqing, Sichuan, and other places, 52,000 times. As for Shenyang and Taiyuan, due to their special circumstances, they are temporarily listed as special zones, calculated at 200,000 times. Furthermore, President Zhang Qun stated in the political affairs meeting today regarding the adjustment of the treatment of public school personnel: the government is determined to consider the stability of the lives of public school personnel and adjust their treatment. He hopes that public school personnel across the country can appreciate the government's hard work and jointly seek strategies for suppressing the rebellion and building the country. It is also heard that the total amount of expenditures increased due to the adjustment of treatment reaches 12 trillion yuan per month, accounting for the largest figure in the government's income.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Government and Public Deeply Express Outrage at the Unfortunate Incident in Kowloon City; Guo Dehua Lodges Another Protest with the Hong Kong Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Supervisors Li Xiaoting, Li Zhengle, Wang Pingzheng, Wang Shuhui, Bai Rui, Huang Fengchi, and others, believe that the Hong Kong government dispatched armed police to drive out residents of the area, forcibly demolish houses, and injure many people, which is a violation of the treaty. They have suggested that the government immediately lodge a serious protest with the British government and immediately take effective measures to protect the residents of the area.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] When the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council met on the 13th, some councilors expressed their opinions on the Kowloon City incident. It was then decided that the secretariat would invite representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend the meeting on the 14th to report.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 13th] Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, lodged a protest with Hong Kong Governor Grantham today regarding the Hong Kong police injuring Chinese residents in Kowloon City. He also requested that no more police be sent into the city during the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Hong Kong court today sentenced Kowloon residents Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu to three months of hard labor each for inciting the masses to resist the demolition of houses.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Regarding the Kowloon City demolition incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made no further comments on the 13th, only stating, "Our position has been clearly stated in the protest letter on the 8th and in the two protest actions themselves. We sincerely hope that the British side will instruct the Hong Kong government to cease any compulsory actions as soon as possible and seek a solution through diplomatic channels." The British Embassy is also paying close attention to Foreign Minister Wang's stern protest on the 12th and has immediately reported to the London government. It is reported that Ambassador Stevenson is deeply troubled by the Hong Kong side's further escalation of the situation. When our reporter discussed this issue with Embassy Secretary Ban An on the 13th, he described the reports he received from the Hong Kong government in his capacity as a spokesperson. He did not deny that this was a regrettable incident and said that the embassy was awaiting instructions from London and hoped that the matter could be resolved quickly. When the reporter asked whether the British government had considered returning the leased territory of Kowloon to China, he replied with a smile that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had only notified the British government in the spring of 1943 when the new Sino-British treaty was signed, stating that it reserved the right to recover Kowloon, but had not yet raised the issue for negotiation. Mr. Ban said that the point of contention in the Kowloon City incident was the difference in the interpretation of the treaty clauses. Mr. Ban was ordered on the 13th to go to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate on this matter. (Reactions to the Kowloon City incident from various places are published on page two)</p>
<h3>Beiping Officially Designated as a Secondary Capital by Order of the National Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The National Government orders that Beiping, with its majestic scenery, controls mountains and seas, connects Songliao, and embraces Hebei, is rich in resources, and has access to all directions by sea. Its customs and culture inherit the essence of past dynasties and are admired by the entire country. Since the Northern Expedition, the government has established its capital in Nanjing. Considering the situation, it still regards Beiping as an important town, reorganizes and manages it, sparing no effort. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the country is united. The government is about to continue suppressing internal turmoil and seek construction. The key to the northern gate is of great concern. It is appropriate to plan ahead and expand the system in accordance with the times. Therefore, Beiping is officially designated as a secondary capital. The Executive Yuan is instructed to supervise the competent authorities to consider the current and past situations, make proper plans, and implement them separately, to highlight the achievements and create new regulations. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Various People's Organizations in Baoding Jointly Telegraph Chu Xichun to Urge Him to Assume Office; Various Departments and Offices of the Provincial Government Have Completed the Handover</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 13th] The handover matters of various departments and offices of the Hebei Provincial Government have been rushed to completion. Except for the heads of various departments and offices who remain in Beiping, most of the provincial government officials are waiting in Baoding for the handover. Furthermore, before the arrival of the Director of the Provincial Committee, provincial administration has not been suspended. Yesterday, various people's organizations in Baoding jointly telegraphed Chairman Chu Xichun to urge him to come to the province to assume office.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 13th] The Hebei Provincial People's Self-Defense Association selected Li He and Wang Xifu to fly to Shenyang on the morning of the 13th to visit Chen Cheng and Chu Xichun separately, requesting Mr. Chu to return to the province to assume office immediately.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Economic Affairs Drafts Implementation Guidelines for Suppressing Hoarding of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The implementation guidelines drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs based on the "Measures for Suppressing Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" were not discussed at the political affairs meeting on the 13th due to time constraints and will be submitted at the next meeting. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The items to be suppressed under Article 2 of these measures are temporarily limited to the following items. Items suppressed under other separate measures for suppressing hoarding will be handled in accordance with the provisions of those measures. A. Food Category: Food (grain, rice, wheat, flour), salt, sugar, cooking oil. B. Clothing: Cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth. C. Fuel: Coal, charcoal. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and other central material management agencies may, at any time, supplement, designate, or temporarily suspend the suppression of various items listed in Article 2 of the original measures within their respective scope of responsibility by submitting a request to the Executive Yuan. The term "large quantity" in Article 3, Paragraph 1 of these measures refers to quantities exceeding the needs of each person for three months for direct consumption items, and quantities exceeding one-fifth to one-third of the annual demand for business needs items. The limits for suppression may be determined by the local competent authorities at any time based on the above standards, taking into account the supply and demand situation for each category of goods. The term "profiteering behavior" in Article 4 of these measures refers to storing goods without providing them to the market as much as possible and raising prices beyond legitimate profits. Local competent authorities should personally organize a price evaluation committee to assess prices at any time, taking into account local conditions, including legitimate profits. Those who are unwilling to sell at the assessed price or sell at prices exceeding the assessed price should be considered to be engaged in profiteering behavior. The public notice referred to in Article 7 of these measures should be no less than ten days. Enforcement should be carried out after the expiration of the period. The term "sell within a limited time" in Article 8 of these measures refers to the excess goods stipulated in Article 3, Paragraph 1, which should be sold within one month. The term "fair price" in Article 12 of these measures should be assessed by the local price evaluation committee. The "purchase and sale registration report" referred to in Article 13 of these measures should be submitted by the end of each month by the industry association, reporting the purchase volume, sales volume, and inventory volume for the previous month to the local production management authority for verification. The factories and shops referred to in Article 15 of these measures should submit the production volume, sales volume, and inventory volume or purchase and transportation volume for the previous month by the end of each month to the industry association, which will forward the report to the local competent authority for verification. The competent authorities referred to in Article 16 of these measures should send personnel to investigate the resale, storage, and transportation of various designated items within their jurisdiction at any time. The investigation targets include ledgers, receipts, factory buildings, warehouses, and other storage locations. The term "and may be fined more than 1,000 yuan" in Article 17 of these measures should be calculated according to the current fixed standard, multiplied by 1,000. When imposing the penalties in the preceding two articles, namely Articles 17 and 18, referred to in Article 19 of these measures, the names should be published in addition to being filed with the Ministry of Economic Affairs for future reference. The "implementation rules to be separately formulated" referred to in Article 25 of these measures should be drafted by the local competent authorities with reference to the implementation guidelines of these measures, and the implementation details of these measures should be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs through the provincial and municipal governments for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Army Training Conference; The Chairman Personally Presides and Gives Sincere Instructions; The Conference Lasts Three Days and Will Draft a New Training Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Army Headquarters convened the Army Training Conference, which officially opened in Nanjing on the 13th. The conference is scheduled to last for three days and close on the 15th. Participants include senior generals from the Army Headquarters, the Army Training Command, the Ministry of National Defense, and responsible persons from military schools, including Sun Liren, Guan Linzheng, Huang Wei, Jiang Jingguo, Tang Enbo, Guo Chan, Lin Wei, Liu Fei, and Xu Sipeng. When the opening ceremony was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, Chairman Chiang personally presided and gave sincere instructions on the heavy responsibility of suppressing the rebellion, building the country, and building the army on the spot. The morning meeting was for officials of various units to present reports, and the afternoon was for group review, divided into three groups. The first group was new recruit training, convened by Sun Liren, the second group was officer training, convened by Tang Enbo, and the third group was special forces training, convened by Jiang Jingguo. It is heard that the purpose of this conference is to exchange opinions in order to propose a new training plan as a guideline for future training of officers and soldiers. When formulating this plan, special attention will be paid to past training experience, and the training results of the US military will also be referenced. The opinions of the US military advisory group will also be respected. At noon on the 13th, Tang Enbo hosted a banquet for the senior generals attending the meeting. At 7:00 p.m., Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for Sun Liren, Tang Enbo, Guan Linzheng, Huang Wei, Jiang Jingguo, etc. at his official residence and gave further military instructions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] Authoritative sources revealed that the Army Training Conference decided today to establish five new recruit training centers in the country to cultivate fresh troops for the National Army to suppress the rebellion. These five training centers will be established in Beiping, Shenyang, Hankou, Chongqing, and Xi'an. General Tang Enbo is responsible for the training plan. It is planned to train ten reserve divisions in each training center. These training centers are different in nature from the current trainee training center in Taiwan. The latter's main purpose is to develop and train the use of modern weapons and refine amphibious combat troops. At today's Army Training Conference, Chairman Chiang emphasized the importance of training troops for suppressing the rebellion. During his recent inspection of the front lines, he found that the training of the National Army was lacking, and troops who were not trained and skilled were often sent to the front lines, which caused the National Army to suffer setbacks before the battle. It is also learned that the Army Training Conference also discussed the plan to reorganize the New First Army and the New Sixth Army into the New Seventh Army.</p>
<h3>Ensuring the Northeast; The Abandonment Theory is Absolutely Not True</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] It is revealed here that among the key points emphasized by Chairman Chiang during the military conference he presided over in Shenyang last weekend included repairing the railway south of Shenyang and protecting the corridor between Liaoning, Rehe, and Chahar at all costs. These reports can overturn the rumors prevalent in the Northeast and North China that the National Army will withdraw from the Northeast. At the meeting in Shenyang, the Chairman also advocated sending strong National Army troops to the area north of Lushun and Dalian to isolate the large number of communist troops concentrated there.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 13th] The spokesperson of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters today denied the rumors that the military affairs inside and outside the pass would be under the unified command of Fu Zuoyi. Mr. Fu had not heard anything about this during his trip to Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 13th] It snowed again on the night of the 12th, and the sound of artillery fire was heard again. A certain cavalry brigade of the National Army drove away the assembled bandits on the north and south banks of the Hun River, 20 kilometers southwest of Shenyang, near Mojiapu and the outer perimeter of Panjiantai. The bandits defended with artillery fire, and the fighting subsided at dawn. Also, a loud explosion occurred near Shilihe Station, ten miles south of Shenyang, on the night of the 12th. The bandits tried to destroy the railway bridge but were repelled. There was no major contact on either side of the Liao River.</p>
<h3>Clearing Scattered Bandits in Taihu Lake; Establishing the First Command Post; Peng Zhanzun Concurrently Serves as Commander</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 13th] Although the Taihu Lake area has been repeatedly rounded up by the military, police, and security authorities of the Suzhou Youth Army's 202nd Division, scattered bandits still lurk in various places along the lake due to the bandits' constant movements. It has been decided to establish the First Command Post for Clearing the Taihu Lake Area, with Deputy Division Commander Major General Peng Zhanzun concurrently serving as commander. Xia Boxun, Deputy Commander of the Second District Security of Jiangsu Province, Chen Honglu, Deputy Commander of the Security of Zhejiang Province, Zhang Shaohua, Director of the Taihu Lake Water Police Bureau, and Hu Xuecai, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Water Police Bureau, will serve as deputy commanders. They will immediately and actively carry out the clearing work and formulate measures for rewarding communist bandits who surrender.

<h3>The Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council Reviews the Budget; Xu Kan Suggests Reforming the Monetary System as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council began its review meeting on the 13th to review the national general budget for the first half of 1948. The meeting was held at the National Government and chaired by Jiang Yong.

Then, the discussion of the budget案 began. Among them, the proportion of expenses for suppressing the rebellion was large, and some senators believed that education funds should be increased. At the same time, they hoped that the revenue part could be adjusted. Others believed that the numbers in this budget were assumptions and did not need to be discussed. The meeting was then adjourned, and it was decided that the group review would be held on the morning of the 14th and the comprehensive review would be held in the afternoon. Also, the total amount of the budget submitted for discussion today, which had been previously passed by the State Council, was 90 trillion, and it was balanced in terms of revenue and expenditure.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Lord Curzon, the British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia (also known as Sir Miles Lampson, the British Minister to China from 1926 to 1933, who was famous both in China and abroad), arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday with his wife aboard a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane from Hong Kong. When a reporter interviewed him, he said that his trip was due to the fact that his two-year term as Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia would expire in March of this year, and before returning to his country, he was very eager to revisit his second hometown – China. He felt very happy to have been invited by the Chinese government this time.

<h3>Confirmation That Three Foreign Female Missionaries Were Killed by Bandits – Missionaries in Bandit Areas to Be Evacuated on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The news that two American female missionaries and one Finnish missionary were killed by bandits has been confirmed yesterday. Among the two American female missionaries, one was Ms. Anderson from Minneapolis, USA, and the other was Ms. Nordon from Chicago. The Finnish missionary was a doctor named Baker from Helsinki. All three were killed during a journey on the Henan-Hubei Highway. According to eyewitnesses: it is believed that the murderers must be the Communist bandits, because when they committed the crime, they shouted, "You are Americans, Americans should die." Two Chinese who were traveling with them were also killed at the same time because they tried to dissuade them. After the news spread, the Church has expressed deep concern about the safety of missionaries in the future. In order to prevent such incidents from happening again, it has been decided to evacuate missionaries from the bandit areas on a large scale, with an estimated number of about 200 people. The Lutheran Church (the American Mission Board of the United Lutheran Church in America belongs to this church) owns the "St. Paul" transport plane, which will be used as a means of evacuation. Mr. Nelson, the person in charge of the church, has gone to Wuhan at the request of the American Consulate in Shanghai to arrange everything. The "St. Paul" has now flown to Chongqing and Lanzhou. Once the normal transportation work is completed, it will go to Laohekou on the 15th of this month to carry out the work of withdrawing the missionaries. (Continued on page 2, column 2)</p>
<h3>Marshall Announces in the House of Representatives That the US Will Propose Aid to China Plan Immediately – Bei Zuyi and His Party Leave Shanghai for the US Today</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 12th] At a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State Marshall reiterated his support for the European Recovery Program and promised to propose an aid to China plan as soon as possible. In response to Bloom's inquiry, Marshall said that he would submit a proposal for aid to China before the discussion of the European Recovery Program is concluded. Secretary Marshall added that aid to China is outside of the European Recovery Program. Although Secretary Marshall did not specify the amount of aid to China, he said that aid to China will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] US Secretary of State Marshall announced to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the evening of the 12th that the Chinese government has notified the State Department to request more financial assistance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] As a result of President Truman's conversation with Marshall, US aid to China seems likely to be determined. However, some Chinese officials now express deep concern that US aid may not meet their desired goals. They believe that Marshall's statement that aid to Europe "must be sufficient, otherwise it is equal to zero" is also very applicable to China. If aid to China is not enough to cope with the reform of the currency system and to overwhelm the Communist bandits, then all aid is a waste.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Bei Zuyi is scheduled to take a Pan American Airlines flight to the United States this afternoon with Hong Shen, the assistant of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, and Zhu Baozhen, the English secretary. Last night, Thomas, the manager of the Shanghai branch of Citibank, hosted a special banquet for Bei, and many of the leading figures in the Chinese and American financial circles were invited to attend. During Bei's three days in Shanghai, he had extensive contact with leaders in the financial community, who provided some information for Bei to take to the United States, but no new proposals were heard. Before this, Bei also met with many leaders of American businesses. Bei is scheduled to stay in the United States for two months, and after returning to China to report on his duties, he will go to the United States again to carry out his mission.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Starting with the Murder of American Female Missionaries</h3>
<p>According to a report from the United Press in Hankou on the 13th: "American female missionaries Anderson and Nott and Finnish missionary Dr. Berg were brutally murdered by Communist bandits last week, 150 miles northwest of Hankou. Foreign church workers in the war zone will be evacuated on a large scale. According to eyewitnesses, the Communist bandits shouted, 'You are British, Americans deserve to die,' before shooting and killing the three American female missionaries and the Finnish doctor; two Chinese who tried to dissuade them were also shot and killed." After reading the United Press report, we were filled with many feelings and did not know where to begin. Let us put everything else aside and, standing solely from a humanitarian standpoint, we cannot help but express our indignation at the Communist bandits' inhumane atrocities.</p>
<p>First, it is a great misfortune for our nation that our country has encountered the Communist bandits' rebellion after the victory of the War of Resistance. And some self-proclaimed liberals, knowing that the Communist bandits are a depraved and inhumane rebel party, still treat them as ordinary political parties in Europe and the United States. Not only do they not actively participate in the government's important work of suppressing the rebellion, but they also stand idly by, and even sometimes add fuel to the fire. The Communist bandits have become rampant to this point, and the self-proclaimed liberals cannot escape their responsibility. We often see in newspapers and magazines texts recording the Communist bandits' atrocities and wanton slaughter of ordinary people. When we ask the self-proclaimed liberals about this, they either defend the Communist bandits or say that it is the government's propaganda offensive. I wonder what they think of this news? And how will they defend the Communist bandits this time? The Communist bandits' hideous faces have long been exposed. The self-proclaimed liberals should finally wake up! Why do they still speak for the inhumane rebel party?</p>
<p>Second, the Communist bandits' anti-American atrocities are no different from the Boxers who caused the Eight-Nation Alliance fifty years ago. This kind of blind xenophobic movement, no matter from which angle you observe it, is harmful and useless to the country and the nation, and to the world and mankind. China has made considerable progress in all aspects after forty-eight years of internal and external troubles. The Boxers who advocated "Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners" should never be allowed to be reborn today. The Communist bandits have always claimed to be progressive elements, but they are doing this kind of anti-era atrocity. The Communist bandits themselves are not to be regretted, but we cannot help but feel sad for the future of the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Third, the Communist bandits have been launching anti-American movements for a long time. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist bandits were unable to achieve their ambition to contend for surrender, so they vented their anger on the United States, shouting the slogan "Down with American imperialism" in the bandit areas and inciting others to oppose American aid. What is their intention? It is self-evident. The Communist bandit Mao Zedong also issued a statement on December 25 last year, saying that "The United States is now interfering in the revolutionary war," and severely criticized the US government. We ultimately believe that the Communist bandits' anti-Americanism will not indiscriminately put innocent American female missionaries on the list of "Down with." But now, in fact, the Communist bandits' slogan is "You are Americans, Americans deserve to die." This kind of blind anti-American atrocity cannot be found a second example in modern countries.</p>
<p>Fourth, the United States, both the government and the public, have recently had a more accurate understanding of the Chinese Communist bandits, but they have not fully understood them clearly. In the past, most Americans thought that the Communist bandits were a revolutionary political party that advocated land reform, so Secretary of State Marshall initially wanted the US government to expand its foundation and establish a democratic government that included the Communist bandits. Only later did he realize that it was impossible for the Communist bandits to join the government. Now, seeing the murder of American female missionaries, we can better recognize the Communist bandits' hideous faces. In the past, American news reporters often came to China to interview, and they were often deceived by the Communist bandits and could not see the truth. We told them about the Communist bandits' atrocities, but they were mostly skeptical, thinking that the Communist bandits would not commit such heinous atrocities. But now, the fact that American female missionaries have been killed is placed before the eyes of the world. Can you still not believe it?</p>
<p>In short, the incident of American female missionaries being murdered by Communist bandits not only exposes the Communist bandits' hideous and ugly faces, but is also a satire of the United States' China policy in the past year. We want the American government and the public to understand that the anti-American movement of the Chinese Communist bandits is already raging and cannot be stopped. To investigate why they are so bold and reckless, and inflict heinous atrocities on American female missionaries, there is indeed an international background. Therefore, if the United States wants to maintain peace and stability in the Far East, and if it wants to maintain its position in the Far East, it should immediately provide comprehensive assistance to the Chinese government, which is currently struggling to suppress the rebellion, without any further hesitation.</p>
<h3>The Turmoil in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Since the Balkan Alliance (composed of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania) was established in December of last year, the Balkan Peninsula, which has been known as the "powder keg of Europe" in modern history, has become a "miniature world," reflecting the white-hot struggle between the two major blocs, which is more serious than in any other corner of the world. And in addition to Romania, where the situation is already tense, the winds over the Mediterranean are suddenly becoming turbulent, with a great sense of impending storm. Among the many news dispatches from news agencies around the world, the ones that are particularly noteworthy are the following: After Greek guerrilla leader General Markos organized the "Greek Free Government" in northern Greece, he will request to formally join the new European Communist International, attempting to obtain unlimited military assistance from the communist parties; The United States recently transferred submarines and other warships to Turkey to strengthen its defense of the Dardanelles Strait, thereby preventing the communist labor force from infiltrating the Mediterranean; The British Mediterranean Fleet will conduct naval exercises in the Ionian Sea southwest of Greece; The rumor that the United States will intervene militarily in the Greek civil war is rampant. Just from these four things alone, the seriousness of the European situation is self-evident.</p>
<p>The breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference, although it brought 1947 to an end in a bleak atmosphere, still left the general public with some optimism about the arrival of 1948, hoping that the coming year would bring a "light at the end of the tunnel." But in the first few days of this year, what we saw in the world was a scene of preparing for a major war everywhere; what we heard were rumors of an "inevitable war between the US and the Soviet Union"; at the very beginning of 1948, when the so-called "a year's plan lies in spring," was filled with these ominous reports, it was really an omen that we humans are about to encounter another catastrophe, making even the people who have the most confidence in world peace dare not be blindly optimistic. The crisis in the Balkans is enough to create a source of turmoil in the world. People around the world should be particularly vigilant about this, especially international politicians and diplomats who are responsible for the safety of the world. They should have a high vision and a far-sighted view, use their political knowledge to prevent problems before they arise, and first sweep away the haze that is shrouding the Mediterranean sky, so as to project the sunshine of peace and stability.</p>
<p>When people comment on the world situation, they all say that the post-war world has reached the end of its rope, and that there is no hope of resolving either the Far East problem or the European stalemate; but when we observe the direction of the world situation and study the root causes of all international problems, we deeply know that opening up the overall world situation is not an absolutely impossible special thing; in other words, as long as the powers that control the fate of today's world can have a thorough understanding and take the peace and stability of the world as the most important thing, and put the interests of their own country in a secondary position, then the divided world can be "reunited," and all the international problems that have occurred after the war can be easily solved. Therefore, the crux of the world's problems lies in the selfishness of the great powers, who cannot tolerate and concede to each other, thus creating an incompatible situation between the two major blocs; this is even more true in the small world of the Balkans. Whether the current tense situation can be eased depends entirely on the hands of the United States and the Soviet Union. As long as the United States and the Soviet Union can dispel their suspicions and repair their relationship, the wind and clouds over the Mediterranean can immediately dissipate. At the same time, we stand on the position of a third party, and we also hope that the people of the United States and the Soviet Union will base their actions on the ideals of world peace and universal justice, because conflict is harmful and useless to both sides. Based on this understanding, it can be known that differences in thinking are not enough to hinder cooperation between the two sides, and even conflicts of interest will not lead to the two sides immediately meeting each other with soldiers. People's confidence in world peace will also be greatly increased.</p>
<p>The victory of World War II can be said to be the result of the sincere cooperation of the five major powers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Since the war camp was able to work together under the principle of "victory first," it is natural that they can also work together under the principle of "peace first" after the war. But why has the situation in the two and a half years since the victory gone against our ideals? The main reason for this cannot but be blamed on the United States and the Soviet Union, who are vying for world leadership. Since the end of the victory of the war, both the United States and the Soviet Union have called for "peace" and "cooperation," and have repeatedly held international conferences to clean up the mess in the post-war world; but both sides only know how to plan for themselves and cannot see the big picture and think about the entire world. Therefore, both sides have opposite opinions on any international issue. Although the world also hopes that the United States and the Soviet Union can seek the big picture from small differences, the opinions of both sides are becoming more and more distant. The Iranian issue in the Near East was able to obtain a barely satisfactory solution, but the stalemate in the Greek problem has not been resolved, allowing it to become a source of turmoil in the Balkans. By February and March of last year, the Greek situation became increasingly serious, forcing President Truman to issue an urgent appeal to Congress, requesting Congress to allocate $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey to resist the intrusion of external forces. The so-called Truman Doctrine was born, causing a serious reaction from the Soviet Union, which not only adopted an uncompromising attitude towards the United States, but also actively carried out anti-American movements internationally, bringing US-Soviet relations to the stage of close contact. Later, in order to ease US-Soviet relations, Marshall proposed the European Aid Plan, putting the Soviet Union on the list of "recipient countries." Although the intention was good, the Soviet Union not only refused to accept it, but also led other countries to oppose it, on the one hand with the so-called "Molotov Plan" to confront the Marshall Plan; on the other hand, it launched a new Communist organization to launch the "anti-American" and "anti-aid" movements in order to consolidate the Soviet Union's position in Europe. From then on, Europe was divided into two, and there was no longer any possibility of compromise. The failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference is an ironclad proof. Now the US Congress is discussing the long-term European Aid Plan, and at the same time is actively promoting the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey. The Soviet Union's counterattack in the Balkans is also an inevitable result.</p>
<p>In short, the turmoil in the Balkans and the turbulent situation in the Mediterranean can be said to be the superficialization of the US-Soviet conflict. The only way to open up the European situation is to restore the previous good relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and restore the spirit of sincere cooperation during the war. Otherwise, no matter how the United States says that aiding Europe and stabilizing the economy can avoid war, or how the Soviet Union says that the anti-American motive comes from peace, the result of each going its own way will inevitably lead to a new war!</p>

<h3>The Ordeal of the Female Missionaries</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1)</p>
<p>According to the oral account of the survivors who were traveling with them, they and the three missionaries who were killed were traveling on a highway bus from Xinyang in Henan Province to Ezhou. On the afternoon of the 7th, when they were 30 miles away from Jingmen, the highway bus was suddenly stopped by more than 50 bandits. All the passengers were ordered to leave the bus. After the three missionaries left the bus, the bandits shouted, "You are Americans, Americans deserve to die." Because Baker did not declare that she was Finnish, she was shot and killed by the bandits first. The bandits then raised their guns directly at the two female missionaries. Two Chinese who were traveling with them bravely stepped forward to dissuade them and were shot and killed first. The two female missionaries then died. The rest of the passengers were released. At present, the bodies of the three missionaries have been found and put in coffins, and it has been decided to transport them to Hankou for burial in accordance with the rituals. The above is the general situation of the ordeal of the three missionaries.</p>
<p>Church Measures</p>
<p>After this unfortunate incident, the American Consul in Hankou, Bacon, once again advised American citizens to leave the dangerous areas of Henan and Hubei. At the same time, church officials also urgently telegraphed foreign workers in Central China, instructing them to evacuate to safe areas immediately. At present, two evacuation stations have been established in the area, one in Laohekou, which was besieged by the Communist army the week before and where 20 Americans and 40 Norwegians have been gathered; the other is in Zhengzhou, where the 100 staff members of the church hospital will be evacuated first, and the foreign missionaries concentrated in Zhengzhou from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway will be evacuated in the second step. Various methods are being devised to transport them out. Mr. Nelson has clearly announced that during the evacuation, no distinction will be made between Catholics and Protestants, and that all will be treated equally and airlifted on the "St. Paul." According to the estimates of Mr. Nelson and other church officials, there are more than 500 foreign missionaries trapped in bandit areas and dangerous areas, of whom nearly 200 have been concentrated in Hankou, where the church's support for them has gradually become a problem.</p>
<p>Missionary Reactions</p>
<p>After the news of the ordeal of the three missionaries was confirmed yesterday afternoon, reporters visited several church organizations. Some church officials believed that the initiators of the forced evacuation of 6,000 foreign missionaries from China in 1927 were the Communist Party. The methods adopted by the Communist bandits today are no different from those in the past. Reporters also met Mr. Hanson, a missionary who evacuated to Shanghai from Xuchang. When talking about the attitude of the Communist bandits towards the missionaries, he said that on the surface, there was no obvious anti-Americanism. For example, when Xuchang was occupied, there was not a single anti-American slogan on the walls of the church buildings, nor was there any act of harming the missionaries. However, between words and sentences, the anti-American color was naturally revealed. When they first occupied Xuchang, they allowed "protection of the lives, property, and freedom of missionaries," but in fact, Communist bandit soldiers often entered the houses and destroyed the equipment and facilities in the residences, and there were incidents of demanding clothes, watches, etc.</p>

<h3>Karen's Visit to Shanghai and Discussions</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Lord Karen's primary mission in Southeast Asia is to liaise with neighboring countries on food matters. When asked about the current food supply situation, he stated: it has improved compared to before. Although the output of the three major grain-producing countries in Southeast Asia—Siam, Burma, and India—is far lower than in the past after the war, he personally is not pessimistic. Mr. Karen continued, the transportation systems in various grain-producing countries have been severely damaged by the war, which has affected production. According to the estimation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization at a conference in India, it will take five years for the grain-producing countries to restore to the same level of production as before the war. Currently, various countries in Southeast Asia are implementing a rationing system. People in Malaya are given only four and a half ounces of rice per day. Although they can obtain flour, they are constrained by habit and are unwilling to eat flour, so the demand for rice is even greater. Most of China's food relies on Siam, shipped monthly from Bangkok. Recently, the United Nations member states organized a Food Liaison Committee, which holds meetings monthly to discuss food issues. Mr. Karen is the chairman of the committee. The first general meeting of the Liaison Committee was held on the sixth of this month, and the results were quite satisfactory. During the meeting, representatives from various countries were open and honest, assisting each other, using surpluses to help those in need, making everyone feel optimistic.</p>
<p>According to reports, Mr. Karen came to China in June 1936 at the invitation of Song Ziwen, the former President of the Executive Yuan, to discuss China's food problem.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked whether it was true that people in Southeast Asia were repelling overseas Chinese. Mr. Karen immediately replied that although this matter was not within his scope of duties, he was certain that there was absolutely no such thing during his tenure there. Not only was there no anti-Chinese sentiment, but the opposite was true. Mr. Karen repeatedly stated, "I can absolutely vouch for this." He also expressed his deep love for China and frequently praised the comfort and enjoyment of his trip to Shanghai on the China National Aviation Corporation's "Overlord" plane.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in the Work of the Military Discipline and Administration Supervisory Group, Spokesman Hopes for an Early End</h3>

Today, the speakers of the three councils of Ji, Ping, and Tianjin, who are also members of the group, flew to Beijing to decide whether the work of the supervisory group will be terminated by the central government.</p>

<h3>Indonesia-Netherlands on the Brink of War, US Pressures Netherlands to Avert Crisis, Indonesia Postpones Reply to Dutch Ultimatum</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 13th] The Antara news agency of the Republic reported that the United States is pressuring the Netherlands to reach a peaceful solution to the Indonesian issue, threatening to halt loans if war breaks out again. It is said that Hoges C. Straite, the director of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, who sought a 400 million dollar loan in the United States, returned to The Hague last week empty-handed.

<p>[United Press, Batavia, 12th] A United Nations delegation is now working intensively in the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, to prevent the resumption of the Indonesia-Netherlands war at noon on the 13th.

Observers fear that if Indonesia refuses, a new war will break out. It is learned that the United Nations delegation is gently persuading the Indonesian government to temporarily agree to the Dutch demands.

<h3>Preventing Western European Economic Suffocation - Urge Speedy Approval of Aid to Europe Plan - Secretary Marshall Asks Congress to Make a Historic Decision</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, December 12] Secretary of State Marshall, on December 12, presented his views on the European aid plan to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly stating that the plan is to cope with a major crisis, and posed the following question to Congress: "Will we take action to deal with this situation? Or will we stand by and allow other forces to determine the future destiny of European civilization?"</p>
<p>Secretary Marshall also pointed out that the actions taken by Congress on the European aid plan must have the following conditions: 1. Speed; 2. Appropriate amount; 3. Effective and flexible execution; 4. Cooperation must be maintained with other participating countries. Marshall also emphasized the importance of the plan to the United States. He said, "If we do not take action to deal with this problem today, it will still occur in the future under conditions more unfavorable to us. The situation in Europe has not yet reached the point where economic instability is progressing towards tyrannical regimes, but if the United States does not support Europe's self-help efforts, then that progress will be inevitable. The United States today faces a historic decision, a challenge to our mission that is extremely serious. The purpose of the aid is to prevent the economic suffocation that is currently threatening Western Europe, without harming its national integrity. Although the aid plan will burden the American people, the amount exported under the plan is still lower than in the past fifteen months. When making the decision, it should be based on our most carefully considered interests, the most important of which is the maintenance of lasting peace and individual freedom in Europe."</p>
<p>Deep Appreciation for Western European Cooperation</p>
<p>Secretary Marshall then expressed his appreciation for the promise of the sixteen European countries to implement a cooperative system, and pointed out that the amount of aid that the United States proposed to provide in the initial fifteen months of European aid, 6.8 billion yuan, is 20% less than the estimate of the Paris Conference. Regarding the plan to manage the program, Marshall expressed his willingness to agree to a compromise plan, stating that he has no prejudice in this regard, but he believes that the power of management should be exercised by one person rather than a committee, and that matters related to foreign policy should be controlled and directed by the Secretary of State. Marshall finally reiterated: European economic recovery is necessary to maintain basic freedom in the world's most critical region, and it is also indispensable for the restoration of normal global trade. The world now has only the United States with the ability to support this movement. He also exclaimed, "We need peace, security, and the rapid restoration of the world to normalcy. We are driven by circumstances to take a leading position. Major crises must be overcome, and we must overcome them." Republican Senator Smith asked if this plan would lead to war. Marshall said that the plan would not lead to war and could avoid war. This matter is like gambling, and there is no guarantee of success, but if we do our best, the hope of success is extremely great. He also warned that if we give up halfway, there will be a great backlash in Europe. If there is no appropriate plan, then money is equal to being wasted, so it is better to have no European aid plan at all.</p>
<p>Plan's Goal: Stabilize Europe</p>
<p>Secretary Marshall was again asked about the chances of Western Europe and the Americas resisting Soviet aggression. He replied: Western Europe, on the whole, is not adequately prepared to engage in such resistance. Most of it depends on whether the people support their government. These developments will force the United States to reconsider its foreign policy, but he is not willing to speculate on this at the moment. Finally, he also stated, "What we propose is neither an aggressive plan nor a defensive plan, but to stabilize Europe. An increase in stability will reduce the chances of aggression."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 13] According to the most confidential documents submitted to the court this morning by the Far East International Court of Justice Prosecution, the Japanese Army Ministry had decided that before Japan completed its military conquest of China, Japan would resolutely refuse and exclude the interference of other countries in the Sino-Japanese War. The date on this secret document is October 11, 1937.

<p>Xie Jiahua went to Hong Kong at the invitation of a Hong Kong film company to make a movie. Her husband Rong Meixin did not agree, so after Xie went to Hong Kong, Rong rushed to force Xie to return to Shanghai. The two sides had a big quarrel and fight, almost leading to a murder, resulting in a stalemate. Yesterday, Xie returned to Shanghai. Beforehand, she notified her mother's relatives, a Mr. Gu who holds the rank of captain in the Ministry of National Defense, and her cousin Xie Ziying, who works as a section chief in the Changning Police Station, to meet her at the airport.

<p>It is reported that the so-called hospital refers to Xie's father, Xie Xiaochu. Xie Xiaochu was convicted of treason. Rong Meixin rushed to Xie's father [blank] to reason after failing at the airport yesterday. There will be negotiations between the two sides in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Police Department Interrogates Corrupt Brigade Commander, Qi Zaiyu Brought to Court in Shackles, Confronts Wu Baokang and His Wife, Obtained Large Sums of Money While Handling Xu Jizhuang Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The corruption and bribery case of Qi Zaiyu, the Sixth Inspection Brigade Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, was heard in court at the headquarters yesterday. The presiding judge was Deputy Commander Yang Bufei, Chief of Military Law Division Zeng Zhaoyi, Section Chief Zhu Cheng, and Secretary Li Jie. The interrogation started at 9:30 AM and ended at 5:00 PM.

<p>The extortion of over 400 million yuan in legal tender from Wu Baokang among Qi's various cases was roughly interrogated yesterday, and the facts of the case have been clarified. Although Qi himself still argued and denied it, it is reported that because the evidence is conclusive, he may be unable to escape the law.</p>
<p>Qi's capable assistant, Xin Runsheng, alias Jin Tuozi, is a somewhat famous "gangster" in the city. Qi used Jin as a "bridge" to extort money from people, with Jin coming forward to handle the matter. This person also had a bad [Blank] during the enemy puppet period, and the charges against him this time are also likely to be serious.</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters will continue to interrogate this case today and will summon Japanese national Kenji Iwai to court, because another of Qi's crimes was using Iwai to extort money from Japanese residents. [Blank] was not available, and the interrogation was not completed.</p>

<h3>Yu Bin Talks About American Aid to China, Reports at a Welcome Meeting in the City</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Yu Bin, the Archbishop of the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church, attended a welcome tea party held by various circles in the city at the Lake Society at 3:00 PM on the 11th after returning to China from his research in the United States at the end of last month. The welcome meeting was presided over by Speaker Pan, and more than 300 people attended, including Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee and representatives of various groups. Speaker Pan first delivered a welcome speech, stating: "Archbishop Yu has shouldered the important task of national diplomacy on this trip abroad. In the United States for two months, he had contact with various parties from friendly countries, dispelled many misunderstandings, and will undoubtedly make a great contribution to promoting the sincere cooperation between China and the United States. Archbishop Yu promoted national policies during the War of Resistance, and his achievements are very great. After the victory, due to the Communist disturbances and the people's livelihood, we need more people with international prestige to explain to friends the internal chaos of the Chinese Communists, which is not only a Chinese problem, but also a major disaster for world peace. Archbishop Yu has just returned to China from the United States a few days ago, and his overseas impressions will surely strengthen our understanding of the international community and our understanding of friendly countries."</p>
<h3>General Views Gradually Changed</h3>
<p>Archbishop Yu then stood up amidst warm applause to deliver a speech. In addition to expressing his gratitude for the welcome and sentiments of all circles, he detailed his impressions of his trip to the United States and the evolution of the understanding of China by various parties in the United States. He said: "I arrived in San Francisco on October 8th last year. After attending the Catholic Conference on the 10th, I went to Boston. In early November, I went to Washington. President Truman convened a special meeting, and members of the Senate and House of Representatives gathered here. I had a great opportunity to exchange views. At the beginning of the meeting, most of the members believed that the target of emergency assistance should be Europe, France, Italy, and Austria, and the Chinese problem was considered secondary. However, since Senator Judd proposed in the House of Representatives that China, France, Italy, and Austria should be jointly included in the target of emergency assistance, after careful discussion, the general views gradually changed. Therefore, when the case was voted on, except for two votes, all the others agreed to add China to the target of assistance. However, when it was transferred to the Senate for approval and submitted to the appropriations committees of the two houses with the approval of the president, the case was re-complicated. The general committee members still believed that the emergency assistance of 60 million U.S. dollars to China that had been passed was not a large amount, but it would not hurt to pay it after the New Year.</p>
<h3>China Policy Suddenly Became Clear</h3>
<p>At this time, gentlemen who actively supported the aid-to-China proposition made impassioned statements to the Senate Appropriations Committee, explaining the seriousness and urgency of the China issue, and it was approved to first [Blank] 20 million U.S. dollars, while the House Appropriations Committee did not fully express its agreement. Therefore, some people advocated [Blank] to give up celebrating Christmas, extend the session, and continue the discussion. The debate was very intense on the [Blank], and some people advocated that aid to China must be combined with economic and military affairs. On the 18th, it was decided to adopt a compromise plan and allocate 18 million U.S. dollars first for emergency loans to China. President Truman's long-term aid to China plan, which was submitted after the resumption of Congress on July 7th, can also be regarded as based on the decision of public opinion on December 18th last year. What needs to be discussed in the future is only various technical issues belonging to the detailed rules. The Central Committee has now assigned responsible technical personnel to go to the United States, and it is believed that the long-term aid to China plan is expected to be formally submitted within one or two weeks. We must pay attention to the fact that in the past month, the United States has had three clear changes in its China policy.</p>
<h3>Marshall Supports Loans to China</h3>
<p>Since the start of World War II, the U.S. government has been implementing its policies based on the "Europe First, Asia Second" principle. This concept has caused many adverse effects. However, with the advocacy of visionary politicians, the general American public has a further understanding of the world situation, and the long-standing concept of "Europe First, Asia Second" has gradually changed to the concept of "Europe and Asia equally important". The emergency aid of 18 million U.S. dollars to China was finally approved in a tense meeting. It can be said that this is the first concrete manifestation of the change in the American "world view". The passage of this case has broken years of principles and history has entered a new stage. (2) General Marshall made the highest contributions in World War II, and most Americans have strong faith in him. After his failure to mediate the Chinese issue and return to China last year, he strengthened the American isolationist "hands-off" proposition. Their common misconception is that the Chinese Communists are not unreasonable, but the Kuomintang is also quite stubborn. However, judging from General Marshall's active support for the US loan to China this time, it can be seen that he not only does not misunderstand China, but also does not want to "stand idly by". The allocation of 18 million U.S. dollars is the beginning of active aid to China; it is not only economic aid, but also military aid.</p>
<h3>The US Has Recognized That the Traitor Bandits Are Causing Trouble</h3>
<p>In the past, many American general discussions believed that the Chinese civil strife was only a matter for China itself, and that the Communist bandits were just peasants demanding land reform, had nothing to do with the international communist camp, and believed that even if officials were corrupt and the government was incompetent, it would be difficult to achieve success with aid. At that time, those who held this view have now completely changed. The American people have generally recognized that the treacherous bandits in China are actually a part of the international communist camp, and the internal chaos in China is not only a matter for China, but is very likely to be the cause of World War III. After General Marshall's last efforts at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference last winter failed, he also clearly stated, "All the doors of hope have been completely closed, and we must start practical work from now on," and the long-term aid to Europe and China plan is the beginning of this "practical work."</p>
<h3>The Walls of the Two Major Camps Are Becoming More Obvious</h3>
<p>At present, the walls of the world's two major camps have become more and more distinct, and the United States' attitude towards the world has become more clear and active. However, it must be known that the active work we will carry out together is not the beginning of war, but the vanguard of peace. We hope that China and the United States will look at each other with a global perspective, and at the same time carry out "re-recognition" and never disrupt the overall plan due to small intolerances. Only with close cooperation between China and the United States and democratic countries can we promote world peace and human happiness." After Mr. Yu's speech, Chairman Fang of [Blank] delivered a reply, believing that Mr. Yu's statement was equivalent to "taking a lesson" on Sino-US mutual understanding, which is worthy of our deep reflection and vigorous review. He also said: "Looking at it from a global perspective, we must seek peace for mankind no matter what. The Communist civil strife is not only a disaster for China, but also a disaster for the human race in the world. Therefore, the government's suppression of bandits and wars is also the most active work for world peace. U.S. aid to China is, of course, appreciated, but people must help themselves first. Our country's war and nation-building must still start with our own efforts." The tea party ended in a warm atmosphere at about 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Uncovers Two Smuggling Cases by Sea and Air; Western Medicine, Saccharin, and Gold Worth 500 Million</h3>
<p>The No. 6 tugboat "Hai Huan" of the General Maritime Transport Brigade arrived in Shanghai last week, towed by the barge "Yanghai Maru" from Hong Kong, and docked at Wharf No. 4 of the China Merchants Bureau. The Customs Anti-Smuggling Division and the Search Team immediately sent personnel to board the vessel. After two days and nights of meticulous inspection, a large quantity of smuggled goods was seized, including Western medicine, saccharin, and playing cards, with a value of approximately 1 billion yuan. In order to thoroughly investigate the location of the smuggled goods, the investigating officers continued to stay on the ship for search. Finally, late at night on the 9th, a suspicious clue was discovered in the first water tank on the starboard side of the ship. After obtaining the consent of the ship's captain, the stored drinking water was drained, and personnel were sent inside for inspection. As a result, a specially made mechanism was discovered inside the water tank. It is reported that the smuggled goods were privately brought in by a certain crew member who is now at large. In addition to confiscating all the smuggled goods, the Customs intends to impose a heavy fine on the shipowner. Furthermore, Customs personnel stationed at the airport, at 2:30 PM on the 11th of this month, inspected China National Aviation Corporation Flight No. T-39, arriving at Longhua Airport from Guangzhou and Hong Kong. They found forty gold bars on the body of a certain Zheng, a radio operator on the plane, tied to his waist with a specially made cloth belt, and obtained a letter proving that the gold bars were entrusted by a friend in Hong Kong to be smuggled in for profit. It is reported that the total value of the smuggled goods in the above two cases is 5 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Needy Students Hope for Relief</h3>
<p>Our newspaper has already started the "Reader Scholarship" fundraising campaign for the spring semester of the 37th year. On that day, we received multiple phone calls and more than a dozen requests from needy students. Apart from two inquiries about donations, most were about the application date and procedures. We have answered all of these inquiries one by one. At the same time, these facts also tell us that countless needy students are anxiously hoping for relief for their educational problems.</p>
<p>The "Reader Scholarship" is now starting to solicit donations. We dare not harbor excessive hopes, because whether its outcome is satisfactory depends entirely on whether readers can give us the greatest assistance.</p>
<p>This year's fundraising for the "Reader Scholarship" will not use the "Goods Fundraising Team." This is in order to promote this movement more broadly and deeply, so that every enthusiastic reader can do their best to donate, the more the better, and even a small amount is acceptable. As the saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle," and a small number can add up to a large sum. The Lunar New Year is coming soon, dear readers! Save a little more extravagance to help the young people who are waiting for help.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Campaign Seeks Readers' Assistance</h3>
<h3>Communist Bandit Organizations Continue to Be Broken Up in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Fengxian; 17 Criminals Arrested, Many with Status</h3>
<p>The Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Command recently assisted a certain organization in the city in breaking up a Communist bandit materials supply association, arresting as many as seventeen criminals. This case is related to the previous case of Ding Xisan's defection and rebellion to the Communist bandits. The investigation is recorded as follows: A certain organization in the city received a secret report last month, knowing that important Communist bandit members had been sent to Shanghai to plan the transportation of materials, and had opened more than a dozen company names in the city as cover. After requesting assistance from the Garrison Command, Commander Xuan immediately issued an order to the Inspection Department, ordering the Waterborne Brigade to assist in handling the matter. The brigade commander, Feng Zhongda, immediately dispatched his subordinates to conduct a secret investigation. On the afternoon of the 23rd of last month, it was discovered that the main criminal in the case, Yu Chengxin, was hiding in Room 233, Zhongzhou Hotel, No. 117, Lane Jia, Shandong Middle Road. Personnel were immediately dispatched to arrest Yu Chengxin, the political commissar of the Communist bandit Maritime Work Committee, Sun Jiao, the deputy commander of the Communist bandit Jiangnan People's Self-Defense Army, and Xiang Junhua, the general person in charge of the Communist bandits (it was found that Xiang was the general manager of a large entertainment establishment in the city), and others, totaling four people. After questioning the team, the team continued to arrest Zhang Heqing, the battalion commander of the Communist bandit Jiangnan People's Self-Defense Army, in Room 140, Jiangsu Hotel, Fuzhou Road, and Shi Liangyuan, a Communist bandit liaison worker in Shanghai, at the funeral home in Nanshi (it was found that Shi was a famous doctor in the city), and Zhang Zongqi and Zhang Zhiliang, personnel in charge of Communist bandit material transportation, at No. 361, Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen. According to the confession, Pei Shaoqing was arrested at No. 6, Baoyuan Street, Yang'an Lane, outside Panmen, Suzhou. It was also discovered that the Communist bandits had a secret radio station in Fengxian for Shanghai-based personnel to use for communication. Personnel were dispatched overnight and broke up the Communist bandit radio station organization at Ruan's Residence, Sanguantang, Fengxian, confiscating a large number of transmitting and receiving machines and other items. Ruan Li, the radio operator in charge of the radio station, was arrested and brought to Shanghai for questioning. Subsequently, Pan Yi, Zhou Anjun, Deng Changyi, Zhou Changqi, Jin Boyi, Jiang Zhuzuoxian, (the head of Wangjiaqiao Township, Fengxian), Tang Boquan (the captain of the Fengxian Self-Defense Team), and others, totaling seventeen people, were arrested in connection with Huacao. After interrogation, all the criminals were transferred to the Nanjing Ministry of National Defense by express train at 9:00 PM on the previous day (12th) for questioning.</p>
<h3>Five Criminals in the Case of Smuggling Pigments to the Bandit Area Transferred to the District Procuratorate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The First Naval Base Command yesterday transferred five criminals, Wang Ruiqi, Xi Cailang, An Atong, Gong Yuelang, and Zhang Genfa, in the case of smuggling pigments to supply the bandit area, and requested the District Procuratorate to investigate. After a brief interrogation by the prosecutor, they were ordered to be temporarily detained. In October of last year, the First Naval Base Command received a secret report from a person named Zhu Hongliang, stating that a merchant named Wang Ruiqi and others were using a sailboat to smuggle a large quantity of pigments from Shanghai through Chongming into the bandit area for supply. The First Base Command immediately ordered the No. 108 boat of the 7th Gunboat Squadron to wait at Qiyao Port in Chongming. The sailboat arrived as scheduled and was intercepted. There were ninety large and small pieces of pigments. After being confiscated by the First Base Command, the sailboat was handed over to the Jianghai Customs for handling. The five criminals were all ordinary citizens and were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lu, the Wei Captain of Zhou Fohai's Guards, Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Lu's case on suspicion of being a traitor was indicted by the High Procuratorate yesterday. Zhang was accused of serving as the secretary of the late puppet secret agent tycoon Li Shiqun. After being reported by the Garrison Commander, the High Procuratorate investigated and believed that Zhang did commit many evils during the occupation period, which was well known to people in western Shanghai. After investigation and verification by the Garrison Commander and the Changning Road Police Sub-bureau, the prosecution was initiated in accordance with Article 3 and Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.</p>
<h3>The Hong Zhenliang Brothers Were Accused of Failing to Deliver the Person Reporting Them</h3>
<p>Hong Zhenliang and Hong Pinliang were accused of being involved in affiliation with the enemy, as reported in previous newspapers. According to inquiries, when the High Procuratorate investigated this case, the complainant Jiang Xintian was asked to go to the address to be summoned, but no such person was found. The High Procuratorate sent letters based on the allegations to the Shanghai and Wuxian Goods Tax Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance, and the Wuxian County Government and other agencies, asking if they had ever held puppet positions or other affiliations with the enemy. They have successively replied that there was no such thing. It is reported that Hong Zhenliang served the Party and the country from the 17th year until the 23rd year, when he served as the section chief of the Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance. During the War of Resistance against Japan, after the tax office was moved, although he worked at the Siming Bank, he still served secretly in Shanghai to contact the rear according to the order of the office. In January of the 30th year, he was detected by the enemy puppet 76th Division and arrested at the same time as He and others, tax officials left in Shanghai. After being subjected to torture, he was bailed out by Yu Qiaqing. Fellow villagers from Ningbo in Shanghai, the tobacco factory, tobacco industry, and tobacco exchange industries initiated the organization of the China Tobacco Industry Bank and hired Hong as the general manager of the legal department. According to the tobacco industry, the bank had no shares of the traitor Shao Shijun at the time, nor did it collect puppet taxes. It seems to be a malicious accusation. Hong has now filed a defense, and the truth will soon come out.</p>
<h3>Zhou Qi, a Puppet China Film Actor, Denies Advocating for the Enemy and Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhou Qi, a puppet China Film actor, was accused of being a traitor and was tried for the first time in the High Court yesterday. Zhou was accused of acting in two films, "Jiang Zhou Weeping Blood Record," which he presided over, and "Turning Back is the Shore," which was presided over by the Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the puppet police bureau. He also formed the Heping Opera Troupe and performed dramas in Chongming and Nantong, advocating for the enemy and puppet regime. He was previously reported and the High Procuratorate filed a prosecution. At 9:30 yesterday morning, Zhou, wearing a dark blue melton overcoat, was interrogated by Presiding Judge Xiao Xiefen. He argued that he served as an actor in the puppet China Film because he was forced to make a living. The dramas performed in Nantong and Chongming were all rich in national consciousness and did not advocate for the enemy and puppet regime. He requested the court to investigate, and the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. Zhou remained on his original bail.</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held for Dredging Rivers in Pudong</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The dredging of the shallow Doutaipu and Majiabang rivers started on the 11th of this month. Shen Zonglian, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Structural Section, and others, went to the site to inspect and preside over the groundbreaking ceremony. They also convened a river dredging meeting at Lixing Middle School in Jinjiaqiao, gathering gentry and baolizhang from the area. Secretary-General Shen and Director Zhao delivered speeches respectively, giving detailed instructions on the progress of the river dredging work and the Pudong Avenue project, hoping that local people would cooperate to complete the project as soon as possible. They returned to the urban area at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Deadline for the Dance Ban Approaches; Dancers Are Marrying One After Another; General Meeting Held This Morning to Discuss Re-employment and Making a Living</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's dance industry, which has been silent for a long time, is attempting to make a final struggle as the deadline for the dance ban is fast approaching. Thousands of dancers from all over the city will gather at the Vienna Ballroom at 9:00 this morning to hold a general meeting. In addition to responding to the women's community's campaign to donate winter clothing, the main focus of discussion is how they will transition to other careers in the future. Representatives from military, police, party, government agencies, and women's associations will attend to assist them in making concrete decisions. There are approximately 3,000 dancers in the city. In recent months, due to the surging wave of the dance ban, there have been few new entrants to the industry, and there are many who are tired of the entertainment industry and are seeking someone to marry. Even in the association formed by the dancers themselves to solve the problem of their future, in addition to the general manager Jin Meihong, many of the executives have also married one after another, so the actual number of dancers has been sharply reduced compared to before. It is generally expected that once the trend of dancers marrying has started, the direction of dancers' re-employment in the future will likely still be mostly marrying.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case on Fangbang West Road Solved</h3>

<h3>The City of Zhenjiang Laments the Dying Year Amidst Economic Decline</h3>
<p>[Report from Zhenjiang, 11th] The disaster-ridden 36th year has quietly passed, and most people who are mindful of danger in times of peace still recall the hardships they have suffered in the past year with a heavy heart. The most unforgettable thing is nothing more than prices. People seem to have a dim view of the major policies of the country, which can be glimpsed from the mouths of some public school staff and small citizens who read the wall newspaper every day, especially in anemic Zhenjiang, where this phenomenon is very common amidst the urgent year-end season and the frequent urging of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>The Mountains Are Exhausted, But the Water Is Not Bad; The Blood Is Poor, But the Heart Is Not Broken</p>
<p>After the Opium War, Zhenjiang was opened as a commercial port and flourished for a period of time, but this golden age quickly passed after the Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing through military joint transport, and Jiangshu waterway traffic to Nantong and Taixing in northern Jiangsu. Although its commercial conditions can still maintain the advantage of convenient transportation in terms of imports and exports, the transshipment business it receives has weakened in importance in both space and time. Zhenjiang, as an important transportation hub between the north and south of the Yangtze River and the capital of Jiangsu Province, has a population of up to 210,000 in the urban area, but the consumers are mostly poor public school staff and some thrifty locals, not a commercial area. There is only one flour factory and one match factory locally, nor is it an industrial area. When civil servants cry that their monthly salary is not enough, merchants naturally cry that it cannot be done. Thus, Zhenjiang has formed an anemic city, constantly complaining about poverty all year round. In the few days before the Gregorian New Year, a department store equivalent to Zhenjiang Yong'an Company held a winter sale, but it was difficult to spend 50 million yuan a day. The Five Oceans Department Store is the most popular place here, but that's all there is to the excitement. No wonder the locals humbly say: "Our Zhenjiang only has poor mountains and bad waters." In fact, although the mountains of Zhenjiang are becoming barren day by day, the rolling Yangtze River and the clear springs of Zhenjiang are clear, heavy, and have not been seen to be bad. Although Zhenjiang is now anemic, from the existing social customs, political atmosphere, educational status, and commercial habits, in many ways, people's hearts cannot be considered broken, and the future is still quite bright. It is hoped that it can be entrusted to the finalization of northern Jiangsu, peace with everyone, and the reconstruction of an industrial area where there are many producers and few consumers.</p>
<p>Prices Are Rising Daily; The Year-End Is Viewed More Lightly</p>
<p>From the end of the 36th year to today, Zhenjiang's prices have closely followed Shanghai and risen daily. Under the upward wind of such rapidly rising money, merchants still say they are not making money. The reason is that although more and more money is needed, there are fewer and fewer goods. Selling short and then replenishing inevitably reduces inventory. In this day and age, merchants estimate their respective wealth by only counting goods and not counting money. Now that the dangerous year-end is approaching, the heart of price increases is even stronger, so no matter how tight your monetary policy is, prices are still rising daily, only suffering the people who are still so poor that they have not forgotten the lunar New Year. They have to inquire about business conditions all day long. According to Zhenjiang's current price estimates, a middle-class family spends 3-4 million yuan just to buy some rice noodles, salted goods, sugar, oil, incense, candles, and paper horses for the New Year, while those who are more frugal, such as coolies and rickshaw pullers, also have to spend 1-2 million. If there is no source for this money, then everyone can only view this helpless year more lightly. Thus, the 23 pig shops that have already closed here rarely think about opening before the lunar New Year. Sugar and food shops have only bought half the amount of raw materials used last year for the New Year. The largest shoe store only hopes to sell 50 pairs of shoes a day. The candles in incense shops are becoming thinner and thinner, and the firecrackers in firecracker shops are even smaller. Small items, such as children's toys, are also scattered like distant stars on the stalls. Compared with last year, this year feels dim, which is expected to be dim according to regulations, and feels a little miserable according to custom. However, for the sake of frugality, suppressing rebellion, and building the country, people still better view this old year-end more lightly, why suffer!</p>
<p>2,900 Shops; The Back Walls Are All Desolate</p>
<p>Speaking of the year-end and thinking of last year, according to the reporter's investigation: among the more than 2,960 shops belonging to the 66 trade associations in Zhenjiang, the most profitable in the year 36 were the Five Oceans and department stores, followed by the silver and money industry, "China" and "Transportation" among the national banks, "Shanghai Bank" among the commercial banks, "Provincial Bank" and "Su Agricultural" among the local banks, and "Jin Yuan" among the money industry. The oil and tung industry went through the year plainly. The timber industry was not bad in the first half of the year, but it was pulled to a draw in the second half of the year because of the police along the river and obstructed transportation. The grain industry mostly had a surplus, and the silk and cloth industry barely managed to cover expenses. The western industry saw both prosperity and decline. Cotton yarn was limited in appetite and had no great profits, but a few speculators made very good profits. Among those who lost the most money last year, the first was the wheel industry, which was constantly plagued by coal shortages. Almost every company said it was losing money. In addition, restaurants, dim sum shops, and bathhouses also had no profits to gain. According to general merchants, there are two reasons for the sluggishness of Zhenjiang's commerce: one is small capital, two are few sources of wealth, and three are few loans. Now that industrial and commercial loans have stopped, and bills of exchange cannot be done, and in-kind mortgages are only urged to be redeemed and not accepted, the crisis for merchants with insufficient capital will be even greater if they beg for usurious loans. At present, the result of tightening the money supply can only achieve mutual benefits and disadvantages, and it is difficult to hope for absolutely helping to suppress prices, because there are very few hoarders in Zhenjiang, so the shops in Zhenjiang, except for a few grain shops, nine out of ten have no warehouses, and nine out of ten have three walls not empty, and one wall is desolate. This one wall is the back wall that was full of inventory in the past. Desolate back walls are a common phenomenon in Zhenjiang's commercial market. Therefore, last year, the direct tax that Zhenjiang merchants could barely contribute to the country was only 1.3 billion yuan for the whole year, and they still felt strained by that amount.</p>
<p>Poor Fried Dough Sticks; Skinny and Too Weak to Endure the Wind</p>
<p>Although the merchants' saying has its reasonable grounds, according to the view of the general consuming public, it is felt that today, when the government is tightening the money supply and tightening the monetary policy, if it can implement universal rationing of food and daily necessities, and then add a reasonable and sympathetic approach to stabilize prices, the economic situation should be improved. However, if the flat-price policy in various places can only be applied to fried dough sticks and boiled water, and they are not allowed to increase prices, one eye is opened and one eye is closed, allowing them to become smaller and thinner every day, and less and less every day, that approach is not enough to be a model. Now, the 1,000 yuan fried dough stick in Zhenjiang has had a miracle. That three-inch long, six-fen wide, poor fried dough stick is so skinny that it cannot withstand a gust of wind, and it may be blown to the ground. (Our Special Correspondent Fang Canglang)</p>

<h3>Second Expansion and Merger of Townships, Wuxian County to Implement Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 13th] This county has decided to implement the second expansion and merger of townships on February 1st. The current 129 townships will be further reduced and merged into 59 townships to facilitate supervision and enhance administrative efficiency.</p>
<h3>Friends of Farmers in Changzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin, 10th] In the heart of the Jiangnan Plain, tens of thousands of shi of golden grain are appearing on the stage under the faint autumn sun. The farmers who have worked hard for three springs and one summer cannot help but think of these two friends of farmers at the time of autumn harvest and winter storage: Qi Electric Power Plant and the Farmers Bank of China.</p>
<p>Outline of the Power Plant</p>
<p>Qi Electric Power Plant is located between Dingyan and Qi townships, about 15 kilometers outside the east gate of Wujin. The plant site covers a large area. To the east, it is connected to the machinery factory, with chimneys towering high and workshops lined up. As passengers pass by on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, it resembles a modern industrial zone. The plant was originally built in the 11th year of the Republic of China [i.e., 1922] as the Zhenhua Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant, a joint venture between Chinese and German businessmen, originally planned to manufacture generators. The power plant was completed in the 12th year [i.e., 1923] and began generating electricity for civilian use in Changzhou and Wuxi counties. In the 17th year [i.e., 1928], due to poor business and frequent disputes, the government, at the request of local public organizations, took it over and nationalized it, placing it under the Construction Committee. In the 26th year [i.e., 1937], the central government decided to transfer the plant to Yangzi Electric Company for private operation. During the occupation period, it was occupied by the enemy for eight years and suffered severe damage. After the victory, it was initially taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and soon operated by the Tenth Company, nominally a joint venture between government and business.</p>
<p>Glimpse of Equipment</p>
<p>There are currently six tin furnaces. Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were produced by German Babcock &amp; Wilcox and were originally installed by Zhenhua. Each has an evaporation capacity of 10 tons per hour. Number 5 is also a product of the same factory, with an evaporation capacity of 30 tons. Number 6 furnace is a Riley product with an evaporation capacity of 50 tons. The generators have four steam turbine types. Numbers 1 and 2 have a capacity of 3,200 kilowatts each and are products of Siemens, but they are old and are now used as backup machines. Numbers 3 and 4 are products of AEG. Number 3 has a capacity of 3,200 kilowatts, and Number 4 has a capacity of 7,500 kilowatts. There is also a newly installed mobile generator, a Mitsubishi product, with a capacity of 2,500 kilowatts. This machine is entirely mounted on a train-style frame. The style is novel and was originally a wartime product, easy to move during emergencies. The factory is building a new house to accommodate it. Other facilities such as coal transportation and water supply are complete.</p>
<p>Electric Irrigation</p>
<p>The total daily power generation is approximately 210,000 kilowatt-hours or more. In addition to illuminating the people of Changzhou, Wuxi, and Danyang with "brightness" and turning the wheels of various industries with power, what is most commendable is the promotion of electrified irrigation, which directly benefits farmers. If there is a TVA movement in China, the Qi factory is undoubtedly the originator. Trial implementation began in the 13th year of the Republic of China [i.e., 1924]. The irrigation area was initially limited to Changzhou and Wuxi counties. In the 19th year [i.e., 1930], the Construction Committee believed that this matter was of great importance and established a special agency to manage it, and the scope was expanded daily. In the 27th year [i.e., 1938], electricity was extended to Danyang, and part of the farmland in that county also became electrified. This work was quite difficult and was not interrupted even during the occupation period. The scale has now taken shape, and farmers find it convenient and the effect is remarkable. There are a total of 128 electric pumping stations in Changzhou, Wuxi, and Danyang counties. The benefited farmland in the three counties totals approximately 143,000 mu. Changzhou, being located near the water, has as many as 92 stations, benefiting more than 70,000 mu of farmland. Mr. Zhao Guangyu of the factory, who is in charge of this matter, has contributed a great deal and is particularly commendable. However, the supply and demand are still far apart, and it is hoped that the factory will make more efforts.</p>
<p>Activities of the Farmers Bank of China</p>
<p>The Changzhou branch of the Farmers Bank of China has been very active in promoting rural welfare and supporting production this year. It has spared no effort in handling fertilizer loans, water conservancy loans, and silkworm and cotton cloth loans. Mr. Chen Mo, the director of the agricultural loan department of the bank, under the leadership of the person in charge, Mr. Wu Guangmo, travels day and night between the city and the countryside, carefully plans and organizes meticulously, and has won the exceptional goodwill of the farmers, who call him a messenger of good news, which is particularly commendable. The cotton cloth production and sales cooperation he has organized, lending to farmers to purchase looms and cotton yarn for weaving, means that in the villages around Hutangqiao outside the south gate, almost every household has a loom and every household is weaving. As a result, the daily output of Changzhou cotton cloth is more than 30,000 pieces, with more than 20,000 looms, requiring more than 300 bales of yarn per day. This rural weaving actually accounts for a crucial part of the military needs. The transfusion work of rural weaving is thoughtful and flexible, and the Farmers Bank of China has made the greatest possible friendship.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Assistance</p>
<p>Changzhou's irrigation industry was quite developed in the past, but it suffered severe destruction during the Anti-Japanese War. The Bank is carrying out planned restoration of the original equipment first, and then gradually promoting and expanding it. In terms of manpower, it is cooperating with agricultural associations, cooperatives, and water conservancy associations in various townships to organize institutions dedicated to this task. This year, 30 electric power stations have been restored, and the required equipment includes square sheds, boat-style brick houses, motors, belts, water pumps, water pipes, transformers, and electric meters. The power stations rely on the Qi factory for electricity supply. If electricity cannot be delivered everywhere, mechanical pumping is used instead. With the assistance of the Farmers Bank of China, 33 machine stations have been restored this year. The important equipment includes machine boats or brick houses, diesel power machines, pump belts, and water ditches. The maximum horsepower is 30 horsepower, and the minimum is 18 horsepower. The bank's loans are specifically used for purchasing or repairing motors, square sheds, poles and wires, lead-in wires, water pumps, and electric meters. The total price of the above two types of equipment at that time was 190,000 yuan. The bank grants loans at 60%, totaling more than 116 million yuan, and the rest is raised by the farmers themselves. Beforehand, personnel are sent to Shanghai together with representatives of farmers' organizations to order goods, and the bank's internal organs pay according to the order form to prevent malpractice. For self-raised electric pumping, each mu of land is paid 50 jin of grain in advance, and for machines, each mu is charged 10,000 yuan. The self-raised funds, together with the loans, are mostly used to purchase equipment, and the rest is used for fuel and miscellaneous expenses. The economy is quite clear and open.</p>
<p>Farmers Benefit</p>
<p>Using machine power to pump water eliminates hard labor, which is extremely convenient for farmers. At the same time, under the implementation this year, a total of 43,127 mu of irrigated land has benefited more than 6,270 farmers. From an economic point of view, if manual pumping is used, with each frame managed by four people and irrigated four times per season, the wages for 43,000 mu of land would be at least 3.5 billion yuan or more per season, while the cost of using electricity and machinery is only 200 million yuan, saving more than 3.3 billion yuan. At the same time, with proper and timely irrigation, the rice seedlings grow well. According to experts, the minimum increase in yield per mu is half a dan, which means an increase of more than 21,500 dan for more than 43,000 mu. At the current price of 350,000 yuan per dan, this would mean an increase of more than 7.5 billion yuan. No wonder farmers in general are extremely grateful for the assistance of the Farmers Bank of China. The bank is planning to expand its business in the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948]. It is hoped that the government will strongly support this practical work related to national economy and people's livelihood so that it can develop to a high degree, and then rural construction and national construction will no longer fail.</p>

<h3>Station Robbery on the Changzhou Train</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin, 12th] At more than one o'clock in the early morning of the 11th, the Shanghai-Zhenjiang section train No. 5 or 6, when arriving at Changzhou Station from Qixiayan, should have stopped as usual. Unexpectedly, there was a power outage at the time, and the entire station was pitch black. Although the stationmaster on duty used a red light to indicate the stop, the train drove straight through, ignoring the signal. Then, the train immediately used danger signals and blew the whistle frantically, but all were ineffective, and the train drove past. It was only after crossing the Xiyang flag for two kilometers that the train was retracted back to the station. This fact was extremely dangerous. It was an unprecedented and astonishing event in the history of traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. According to the driver Song Shunlong, two strange passengers wearing cotton military uniforms boarded the train at Qixiayan and sneaked into the driver's cab, threatening the driver with handguns and forbidding him to stop at Changzhou Station. The driver, fearing the intimidation, had no choice but to drive past the station. After the two got off the train and fled north, he retracted the train back. The station police immediately dispatched officers to pursue them upon receiving the news, but there was no trace of them. The responsible parties are currently investigating.</p>

To establish a scientific research institute in Amanson, at the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil, South America, this year to engage in research on geology, meteorology, animals, etc. To establish nutrition centers in China and India. These centers are linked to world agricultural and food organizations. Others, such as facilitating the travel of scientists, exchanging professors and students, and strengthening the flow of scientific publications, are all discussed and must be implemented by the UN Education Conference. After the conference, in addition to visiting the United States, Mr. Li also stayed in Tokyo for a week on his return trip to observe the work of scientific research in Japan.</p>
<p>Japan Buries Itself in Scientific Research</p>
<p>Dr. Li said: The first impression of Japan is that the bombing during the war was fierce. Tokyo and Yokohama were bombed into ruins, proving that Japan was no longer able to fight. Even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, they would have had to surrender. He visited the University of Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Imperial University), which is large in scale, with the buildings of the "Physics," "Chemistry," "Engineering," and "Agriculture" colleges concentrated and well-equipped. He visited the Physics Research Institute, which was mostly destroyed by bombing during the war. Atomic physics research is now prohibited, and the original two atomic splitters and another splitter in Osaka have all been thrown into the sea. The current director of the institute, Dr. Hebon Ganh, is a nuclear physicist with a very good reputation. The Aviation Research Institute of Tokyo University has been renamed the Tokyo University Institute of Science and Technology. It is well-equipped and large in scale. In addition to the aviation department, it is still continuing its work and research non-stop. There were originally twenty wind tunnels for aviation, and three smaller ones are still left. In addition, he visited the Kobayashi Physics Research Institute, which is also working on machinery. Dr. Li also said: Japan is quite poor after the war, but in this difficult environment, scientists are still actively engaged in research work, and this hard-working spirit is extremely admirable. Yu Tang, Japanese scientists, university presidents, and Minister of Education Morito, etc., all highly praised the League of Nations cultural and educational organization, and Japan very much hopes to participate. They have collected various materials related to the League of Nations and compiled them into a book. Japanese scientists expressed their hope to cooperate with our country in scientific research. We also agree that this will only be a future problem when the peace treaty is established. Looking back at our country's current equipment, it is severely inadequate. It cannot be compared with the United States and the United Kingdom, and it is not without shame compared to Japan. In the future, we should have a stable and well-equipped scientific research environment, and Chinese scientists who are currently researching abroad will definitely return home as soon as possible, and our scientific research will definitely be more advanced.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Hanging School Signs Leads to Conflict Between Students of Two Schools in Fujian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Fuzhou, 13th] A conflict occurred between students of two schools in Fujian Province. The school buildings of the Fujian Provincial Senior Business School and the Agricultural College are located in the same corner, and disputes often arise over the time of opening and closing the school gates, with each party harboring prejudices. At 8:00 AM this morning, a newly made college sign of the Agricultural College was hung at the entrance, and it was smashed by students from the Senior Business School. The students of the Agricultural College then launched a large-scale attack, destroying the entire gate of the Senior Business School, and the situation escalated as a result. At noon, all the students of the Senior Business School went to the Provincial Government to petition, and the Agricultural College also posted slogans along the streets, each seeking to punish the perpetrators. Chairman Liu of the Provincial Government and Director Liang of the Education Department personally came to the scene to suppress the situation at 1:00 PM, but there were no results. The authorities announced that the main culprits of the incidents in both schools would be severely punished, or they would be disbanded if necessary.</p>

<h3>Minister Zhu to Fly to Taipei to Inspect Education in Taiwan Province; Expected to Return to Shanghai After a Ten-Day Trip</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and is scheduled to fly to Taipei this morning to inspect education at all levels in Taiwan Province. He plans to return to Shanghai in ten days. Fang Zimao, Minister Zhu's accompanying secretary, met with reporters from this newspaper at the Academia Sinica yesterday and said: This trip is Minister Zhu's first trip to Taiwan in his life. After arriving in Taiwan, he also plans to visit Taichung and Tainan. Education in Taiwan Province has a good foundation due to the long-term rule of the Japanese. National education is widespread, and university facilities are above those of schools in the mainland. After the restoration, coordinating the administrative facilities of the province is also one of the main tasks. After returning from this inspection, Minister Zhu will seek its development in coordination with various aspects. When asked by reporters about the Ministry of Education's work plan for this year and the national education funding issue, Fang replied that after the restoration, the school buildings of various universities would be gradually restored, but the library and instrument equipment still need to be supplemented. In principle, university education will seek qualitative development. As for the development of national education, it is related to the issue of education funding, which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution. Fang emphasized: The Constitution has now begun to be implemented. We believe that the government will increase education funding according to law; otherwise, it would be illegal. As for whether students in provincial and municipal normal schools should be given the same treatment as students in national normal schools, Fang did not give a definite answer. Regarding the private universities' request for financial assistance, he said that the government's current strength is insufficient, and it is feared that it will be difficult to fulfill their wishes. Fang said that the books and instruments for higher education raised by the Ministry of Education in the United States and a part of the science, engineering, and agriculture books and instruments subsidized by the United Nations have recently arrived and will be distributed to various schools by the Ministry, and some of them have already been distributed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education's Secretary Fang Discusses Methods for Studying Abroad with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>When talking about students studying abroad at their own expense, Fang said: Due to the constant changes in the official foreign exchange rate, a new method for studying abroad with self-provided foreign exchange will be implemented this year. The Ministry of Education is currently drafting it and will announce it after it is approved by the Executive Yuan. This new method stipulates that self-funded students must provide all the foreign exchange at market prices themselves and must have graduated from a domestic university and passed a relevant study abroad examination organized by the Ministry of Education. Fang Zhi also said: In terms of the country's current financial resources, the public-funded study abroad examination will be temporarily suspended this year, but the 100 students who have already been admitted to the wartime translation student study abroad examination are expected to go abroad this autumn.</p>

<h3>Dagong Suffers a Scare: Wins Fiercely Against Qingbai: Stalemate Lasts for Over Twenty Minutes, Resulting in 59 to 33</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In last night's basketball league match, the perennial champion Dagong team suffered a scare, almost being embarrassed by Qingbai. The three thousand spectators in the gymnasium were greatly surprised. In the first half, Dagong led by only one point, 20 to 19. In the first five minutes of the second half, the score continued to fluctuate. Qingbai exceeded four times throughout the game, but after each reached 25 points, Dagong finally stood out and soared, resulting in a final score of 59 to 33.</p>
<p>Qingbai Fights Hard</p>
<p>The reasons for last night's situation were: Dagong had just returned from Nanjing, tired from the journey and lacking sufficient practice time. The cold weather and a slight underestimation of the opponent contributed to their initial struggles. Once they fell into a disadvantageous position, they became increasingly frustrated. Qingbai's man-to-man defense and all-out effort were effective, and their taller players provided a significant advantage. In the first half, Qingbai's shooting was unusually smooth. However, after each side reached 25 points in the second half, Qingbai, exhausted from the intense battle, lost momentum. Qingbai's stamina could not keep up. Dagong was confident in their ability and ultimately prevailed.</p>
<p>Only One Point More</p>
<p>Initially, the two sides were locked in a stalemate, with the ball spinning on the rim, frustrating the fans. In five minutes of tense play, the score only changed to 4 to 3, with Dagong leading by one point. Soon after, it became 9 to 3. Qingbai's veterans, Wang Nanzhen and Xu Ting, although having fewer shooting opportunities, made every shot count, gradually creating an even game. When Cai Yanxiong scored, Qingbai took the lead at 12 to 13, surprising Dagong. Trailing by as many as four points at 13 to 17, Tang Shikun fouled out and was replaced by Ju Dayun. In an instant, Dagong tied the score at 17. Dagong managed to take a narrow lead of 20 to 19 by the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Standing Out</p>
<p>Yanxiong's free throw tied the score at 20 at the beginning of the second half, and Shaoqing added another point to give Qingbai the lead again. Dagong's Cai Lianke scored, and soon the score was tied again at 22, 24, and 25, intensifying the battle. Dagong scored two points, and Lianke's free throw made it 28 to 25, after which they sailed smoothly, leading by 14 points at 39 to 25. Qingbai brought in two new players, Wang Junbing and Zhuo Guorong, but their formation was disorganized, and they were at the end of their rope, unable to reverse the situation. The final score was 59 to 33, with Qingbai losing due to lack of stamina.</p>
<p>Other Two Games</p>
<p>The other matches last night: In the second division B group, Jiashen won against Team V with a score of 47 to 34. In the first division group, Shantou easily defeated the U.S. Military Police with a score of 69 to 36. Jiashen's three forwards shot accurately and were physically strong. The first half ended with 24 to 10, and the second half was highly competitive, with Jiashen ultimately winning 47 to 34. Shantou's Chen Qingjiang and He Lide scored the most points with frenzied attacks. The first half ended with 31 to 24. In the second half, Shantou showed no mercy, winning decisively with a score of 69 to 36.</p>

<h3>Measures for Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans: Uniform Handling by Banking and Money Industries: Six Handling Measures to be Drafted by the Banking Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the Executive Yuan promulgated the Regulations on Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry on December 26 of last year (the full text of which was published on page 2 of this newspaper on December 23 of last year), according to the regulations, settlement should be completed within one month after the promulgation of the regulations. In view of this, the Banking Association of this city, immediately entrusted the Banking Association to actively research after the promulgation of the regulations, and has now drafted six uniform handling measures for clearing pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry. The Banking, Money, and Trust Associations will jointly announce and start processing these measures within days. The contents of the handling measures are first reported as follows:</p>
<p>Uniform Handling Measures</p>
<p>Article 1: These measures are formulated in accordance with the Regulations on Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry (hereinafter referred to as the Clearing Regulations).</p>
<p>Article 2: Deposits and loans made on or before August 13, 1937, shall be calculated by doubling the amount specified in the attached table of the Clearing Regulations. The total of principal and interest per yuan is 3,405.924 yuan.</p>
<p>Deposits and loans made from August 14, 1937 to December 9, 1941 (including the 9th), shall be calculated according to the amount specified in the attached table of the Clearing Regulations.</p>
<p>The total amount of principal and interest calculated according to the preceding two paragraphs is uniformly referred to as the multiple.</p>
<p>Article 3: The methods for calculating various deposits are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Fixed Deposits: The original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be the standard. For those that have been rolled over, regardless of whether the deposit certificate or passbook has been changed, the calculation shall be traced back to the original deposit date. However, this is limited to cases where the branch office or division on the deposit certificate or passbook uses the original account name. The calculation method is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Interest Rolled Over: If the principal and interest are fully renewed at the time of rollover, the original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be the standard.</p>
<p>(B) Interest Withdrawn and Rolled Over: If part or all of the interest is paid at the time of rollover and then renewed, the original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be used, and then the interest paid each time (including income tax) multiplied by the multiple of the corresponding payment date shall be deducted, and the remaining balance shall be the standard.</p>
<p>(C) Principal Increased and Rolled Over: If, in addition to renewing the principal and interest, additional principal is deposited at the time of rollover, the original principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be added to the additional principal multiplied by the multiple of the additional deposit date, and the total amount shall be the standard.</p>
<p>The additional principal mentioned in the preceding paragraph refers to the principal actually added by the depositor, excluding the interest on the original principal.</p>
<p>(D) Principal Reduced and Rolled Over: If, in addition to withdrawing interest, part of the principal is also withdrawn at the time of rollover and then renewed, the remaining principal multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date shall be used, and then the interest paid on the withdrawn principal portion multiplied by the multiple of the interest payment date shall be deducted, and the remaining balance shall be the standard. The above provisions shall also apply mutatis mutandis to the rollover of various deposits mentioned in items 2 to 6 below.</p>
<p>2.  Deposits with the nature of Zero Deposit and Lump Sum Payment: Each deposit shall be calculated by multiplying the principal deposited each time by the multiple of the corresponding deposit date.</p>
<p>3.  Deposits with the nature of Lump Sum Deposit and Zero Payment: The calculation shall be made by analogy with the methods in paragraphs (B) and (D) of item 1 of this article. However, for the sake of simplicity, the original principal may be multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date, and then the principal and interest already paid may be deducted, multiplied by the multiple of the corresponding payment date, with the remaining balance as the standard.</p>
<p>4.  Deposits with the nature of Zero Deposit and Zero Payment: The zero deposit portion shall be calculated by analogy with the zero deposit and lump sum payment method. The zero payment portion shall be calculated by analogy with the lump sum deposit and zero payment method.</p>
<p>5.  Deposits with the nature of Principal Deposit and Interest Payment: The original principal shall be multiplied by the multiple of the original deposit date, and then the interest already paid shall be deducted, multiplied by the multiple of the corresponding payment date, with the remaining balance as the standard.</p>
<p>6.  Notice Deposits: Deemed as fixed deposits; those not withdrawn after notification are deemed as current deposits.</p>
<p>7.  Current Deposits: The balance and date of the last receipt or payment shall be used as the standard.</p>
<p>8.  Deposits with the nature of both Fixed and Current: Deemed as current deposits.</p>
<p>9.  Gift Certificate Savings: Deemed as current deposits.</p>
<p>10. Trust funds and deposited security deposits are not treated as deposits.</p>
<p>Article 4: For deposits made before August 13, 1937, in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Clearing Regulations, the interest calculated from the date of deposit to August 13, 1937, when incorporated into the principal, shall no longer be subject to deduction of deposit interest income tax.</p>
<p>Article 5: For interest already paid from August 14, 1937, when deducting from the household in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of these measures, the full amount of the original interest shall be calculated, and the income tax already paid shall no longer be deducted.</p>
<p>Article 6: The calculation method for the clearing of loans is stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>1.  If a portion of the principal of a loan has been repaid, but the interest has not been paid, the remaining amount due shall be calculated according to the multiple of the original loan date. The unpaid interest on the repaid portion shall be calculated and supplemented by combining the multiple of the repayment date.</p>
<p>2.  If there are additional loans or advances made midway after the loan, and interest is not paid, they shall be calculated separately according to the multiple of the respective loan date or advance date.</p>
<h3>Local Buyers Take the Opportunity to Buy Low, Cotton Yarn Market Rises, 42-Count Fine Yarn Rises Back Over Two Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened flat, but soon local buyers took the opportunity to buy low, and replica manufacturers also came to purchase, leading to a rise in prices. Towards the end, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose to 63.3 million yuan, an increase of 2.1 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth Stable</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market showed a promising trend from the beginning yesterday. The Ningbo and Fujian buyers purchased a large amount of Yuan bi ji, and the Hankou buyers also came to purchase, which made the prices more favorable, and the remaining goods were also promising. But after eleven o'clock, the money market suddenly tightened, and Shanxi buyers sold Golden Seal bi ji, and at that time there were few buyers, and because the yarn and flower merchants were subject to a deadline set by the authorities, they had to register tomorrow (the 15th), the industry was generally wait-and-see, and the market atmosphere changed from strong to weak. Towards the end, the price of bi ji rebounded by more than 20,000 yuan due to active trading. Various grades of fine cloth such as 12-pound Dragon Head Wufu also rose from 5,000 to 25,000 yuan. In addition, only bleached cloth and colored cloth, such as shilin cloth and zhen gong, became more popular, and the market atmosphere for other cloths remained soft.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was firm due to the jump in cotton yarn prices, and yarn mills were eager to purchase, and weaving factories also made offers to purchase, and there were mutual transactions between the industry, and the trading was still busy. The trend was not weak, and 800 bales were traded freely.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] China Textile Construction Company continued to purchase stored cotton yesterday, totaling 329 iron machine bales (about 450 catties per bale) and 59 wooden machine bales (about 450 catties per bale). The purchase prices were 5.2 million yuan for Qidong fine velvet, 6.5 million yuan for Dezi cotton, 5.1 million yuan for Hankou fine velvet, and 5.08 million yuan for Babao cotton.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] China Textile Construction Company sold a total of 1,880 pieces of old cloth yesterday as usual (equivalent to 20,380 single pieces), and 160 bed sheets. There were a total of 453 application forms, including 20 from manufacturers, purchasing 1,520 pieces of cloth (equivalent to 3,020 single pieces). 433 cloth shops purchased 17,360 pieces of cloth and 160 bed sheets.</p>
<h3>Rayon Recovers, Silk Goods See High Prices Near Closing</h3>
<p>After continuous declines for several days, the rayon market suddenly recovered yesterday. 120-count Asahi bright yarn opened in the morning shouting a high price of 104 million yuan, but due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it fell back, closing at 2 million yuan. It rebounded in the afternoon, and the afternoon price rose to a selling price of 5 million yuan, and finally to 6 million yuan, while Toyo was 7 million yuan, which means that the average increase compared with the previous day was 8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Silk</p>
<p>Because silk merchants all have allocations, there is no demand, and the market only traded five dan of C-grade silk yesterday, with the price at 105 million yuan, which is the same as the previous day. The asking prices for other grades were similar to the previous day. Dry warp silk has an even narrower path, and there was still no transaction yesterday, and the asking price did not change.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk quilt market rose again. The strong goods opened at about 1.8 million yuan, and the next-day delivery had a transaction at 2.1 million yuan. Due to high selling, it fell to about 500,000 yuan in the middle, and then rebounded near the close. As a result, the closing price for spot was 1.8 million yuan, and the next-day delivery was 2.2 million yuan. The off-site transaction in the afternoon was as high as 2.8 million yuan. Dachang plaid cloth was asking for 180,000 yuan in the morning, but it was not traded. Other goods were generally firm.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Recovered Yesterday, Foreign Stocks Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds recovered because the currency reform was still far away. Unified C opened at 80,000 yuan in the morning, and fell from 84,000 to 69,000 at the close, with a turnover of 4 million, which was 8,000 yuan lower than the previous closing for A, B, and E, and C fell by 12,000 yuan. Unified D fell by 73 yuan. Yesterday, foreign stocks, except for Yeguang and cardboard, which showed a special upward trend, the hot stocks Hong Kong Electric returned to a long of three yuan two and then became weak. Yi Yarn opened in the morning from 650,000 to a high bond step down to 600,000 and then stabilized slightly. The securities dealers were selling and buying, and as a result, compared with the previous closing, British Union fell by half a percent, cardboard rose by one percent, Yeguang rose by half a percent, and the rest were generally weak.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Show Strong Buying Interest, Yong Yarn Creates Another High Price</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were strong in the first half of yesterday and then recovered. The off-site price was always ahead by a lot. The chips were scarce, and once there was news to help the buying, most of the major players in the industry had extravagant hopes, and then ended at a high price.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was still firm, but the hand-over opening was already peaceful, so both the spot and hand-over of Yong Yarn opened at a price of 765 yuan, selling to a low price of 752 yuan and 755 yuan, turning the sale into a purchase, and the off-site asking price was raised to more than 800 yuan, and rose to 785 yuan and 797 yuan. Because there were many sellers, it fell back to 767 yuan and 775 yuan. The off-site interest rate was opened high to three corners and three corners and a half, and the money market tightened, but the market sentiment was good. The market price was around 770 yuan and 780 yuan, and the tug-of-war state lasted for a long time, and then rose to more than 780 yuan and 790 yuan. Near noon, it had fallen to a low price of 760 yuan and 768 yuan, and the noon closing recovered to 768 yuan and 785 yuan. As a result, the spot-delivered stocks Tongyi and Wuhe rose by half a percent compared with the previous closing, Li An fell by half a percent, and the rise and fall of the remaining stocks were slight. The forward-delivered stocks Xinhe Pingping, Yong Yarn and Qinxing rose slightly, and the rest suffered small setbacks.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market opened with the long and short of Hong Kong Electric, and there was a lot of disparity and uncertainty. Yong Yarn initially rose to 788 yuan and 797 yuan, and soon fell back to 770 yuan and 774 yuan. The exchange difference of the National Bank was very large and there was a plate. Later, because of the news that the United States had stopped aiding China, the buyers were unusually intense, and then rose to a high price of 820 yuan and 823 yuan, taking the opportunity to sell high and there was a recovery, but China Silk hung up with a limit up, and the closing price of Yong Yarn was 819 yuan and 821 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning closing, the spot-delivered stocks China Silk rose to the limit, Yonggong, Yong Yarn, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Commerce rose by half a percent, China France and Tongyi rose by one percent, and the rest rose slightly. The forward-delivered stocks Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Jingfu each rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly. The off-site unlisted stocks still looked good. The old stocks Dasheng One Factory and Bank of Communications were the most popular, each rising by one percent.</p>

<h3>The Commission Rate for Purchasing Books, Western Medicines, and Other Items Has Not Yet Been Decided</h3>
<p>The Review Committee for Handling Uncertified Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving at the Port held its 16th meeting at the China Trust Bureau yesterday (the 13th), and discussed the commission rate for purchasing prices for non-quota goods in Annex 3 (A), such as books, electrical materials, and sanitary equipment. As a result, because there are many types of goods, a decision cannot be made for a while, and it is necessary to wait for a comprehensive plan before continuing to discuss at the regular meeting held this Saturday. Regarding the commission rate for Western medicines, because it is the same in nature as chemical products, it will be proposed for discussion together at the next meeting. As for the application for purchasing paper, wood, and hardware from the original importers, as of the previous month, the committee has issued notification orders with a total value of approximately 300,000 to 400,000 US dollars, and the remaining are in wait-and-see mode. In addition, there are still four types of commission rates that the committee has not proposed for discussion: wool, rubber, automobiles, parts, and pigments.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Conditions Stagnant, Oil Market Fluctuating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving at both the northern and southern markets was over 15,100 stones. Rice was supplied for sale as usual, but shop demand was normal, and there were few registered buyers. Market conditions were stagnant. Early Bo rice uniformly fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while medium and lower grades fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. White japonica rice also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and indica rice fell back by over 10,000 yuan. White Yuan and Yin Yuan rice showed a slight weakening trend. Flour saw some activity in retail sales, rising by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour rebounded by 10,000 yuan, but factories continued to dump stock, resulting in abundant supply and preventing excessive price increases. Bran rose slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cake from Taiwan saw slight movement, rising by 10,000 yuan. Yellow soybean oil factories were dull, with customers picking and choosing carefully, and local street demand was flat. Du Huang processed oil fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while customer soybeans showed a similar flat condition. Soybean transactions were quiet, falling again by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Red beans had not yet opened, and retail sales of broad beans were also sluggish, falling by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Cowpeas were selling poorly, declining by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, and red sorghum transactions were scarce, declining by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn demand in Beiyang was weak, with early trading firm but afternoon trading sluggish, leading to a sharp decline before closing, plummeting by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were halted by Guanggang merchants, and local street expectations were unenthusiastic, plummeting by 200,000 yuan. Sesame sales were quiet, with out-of-town merchants inactive, continuing to fall by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Milk sesame plummeted by 100,000 yuan, and black sesame plummeted by over 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market saw little fluctuation, with mixed price increases and declines. Soybean oil was initially firm but tightened later, rising steadily by 10,000 to 11,000 yuan. Raw oil had ample supply but slow sales, showing weakness with a decline of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, vegetable oil saw no significant movement, clear oil remained on a weakening trend, and wheat was strong.</p>
<h3>Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Flourishing</h3>
<p>Transactions in woolen fabrics and goods saw limited actual sales across all channels due to seasonal factors. Among traders, there was mutual buying and selling of spring and summer woolen fabrics, and market prices were generally flourishing. Apart from heavy overcoat woolens, most others rose one after another, with light-colored and light-gray floral woolens being the most popular yesterday. Generally, manufacturers were mostly holding goods and unwilling to sell, and quoted prices were mostly higher than market prices, thereby raising market sentiment.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Turns Firm</h3>
<p>The Chinese medicine market, which had been weak for a long time, turned firm. Pepper has been rising steadily for two days. White pepper recently opened for sale at 210,000 yuan. Black pepper sales from the northern regions were brisk, surging to 240,000 yuan. Crude oil also rose to 24,000 yuan. Xi Xiaohui, which had been weak for years, suddenly saw purchases from out-of-town merchants and followed suit, rising sharply. Last week, it was selling for 8,000 yuan with few buyers, but now it has jumped to 20,000 yuan, and supply is still insufficient, leading to a new record of 24,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market saw continued brisk demand, and Taiwan sugar prices rose uniformly. The association set prices, and futures contracts for refined white and coarse white sugar rose by 6-7 percent. Spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar rose by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, No. 4 half-white sugar rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, and No. 20 medium granulated white sugar rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Taiwan red sugar was initially flat but tightened later, rising by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Local sugar was relatively stable, with Shantou green sugar at 1,700,000 yuan, Diaoqing sugar for Friday delivery at 1,650,000 yuan, Shunde green sugar at 1,670,000 to 1,690,000 yuan, and Xinghua white sugar at 1,980,000 to 1,870,000 yuan, with only slight fluctuations. However, high-quality Xing red sugar was relatively tight, at 1,900,000 to 1,920,000 yuan, while ordinary sugar was at 1,800,000 to 1,850,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both local and out-of-town merchants continued to sell domestic tea as usual. There were still many inquiries, but sellers continued to hold firm, so supply and demand were not balanced, and transactions were still limited. However, prices rose significantly compared to the previous day. As for the foreign tea market, prices were also improving due to the positive sentiment of the holders, so although the buying interest of exporters was still hesitant, prices rose across the board.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, cigarette prices initially rebounded due to the price increase by the Yongtaihe factory, and sellers held firm. Later, it was heard that British Old Knife was distributing goods, and Nanyang Company also announced the allocation of cigarettes, increasing the volume on the market and weakening buying interest. In the afternoon, trading was active in the market, and traders bought up a lot, resulting in a rebound of 400,000 to 800,000 yuan for British Old Knife and Two Cigarettes compared to the previous day. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also turned firm.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices High</h3>
<p>Although there were rumors of distribution of Gu Ben brand soap, the active new buying resulted in particularly strong transactions and a soaring market. In the end, Gu Ben and Jian Dao soap rose sharply by 167,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Guanghua soap rose rapidly by a significant 200,000 yuan due to its low price and popularity among buyers. Other brands such as Zhu Mao Hengli also rose to the 100,000 yuan range. Both the match and kerosene markets remained brisk.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>China Flying Wheel Thread Factory, with a capital of 24 billion yuan, has been fully paid up. The registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be issued soon, and the factory authorities are currently proceeding with the procedures for listing on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>Since the Hebei Bank announced the daily exchange rate between Taiwan currency and legal tender, the allocation price of Taiwan sugar will also be adjusted according to the Taiwan currency exchange rate. The third phase of Taiwan sugar allocation is scheduled to begin on the 15th, and the allocation prices of all grades of sugar will be increased by approximately 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate speculation, the Gold Inspection Bureau has recently intensified its inspections of the business of banks and merchants. Any customer who issues checks, regardless of the amount, will have their accounts temporarily frozen if the check is found to be related to speculative activities.</p>
<p>For the export of yarn and cloth, the National Yarn and Cloth Management Committee will strengthen unified management. The visa matters will be handled uniformly by the Textile Export Association. The association has been notified to prepare measures and submit them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.</p>
<p>The recent volume of cash transported to Shanghai has increased significantly. In addition to sending personnel to inspect the exchange business of banks and merchants, the Gold Management Bureau will also telegraph the local branches of the Central Bank to assist in curbing the increase.</p>
<p>The Central Bank announced interest rates for major cities nationwide: (1) The interbank overnight lending rate is highest in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Bengbu, at 6 yuan per thousand. Shanghai is at 4.5 yuan, and Shangrao and four other places are lowest, at 5 jiao per day. (2) The daily lending rate is highest in Chengdu, at 8.2 yuan per thousand, followed by Chongqing at 7.5 yuan. Shanghai is at 6.5 yuan, and Jinzhou is lowest, at only 8 jiao.</p>

<h3>Explanation of "Returning the Blessing"</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>The December issue of Wen Chao Monthly published Mr. Wang Jisi's "Annotations and Supplements to the Five Plays of the Western Chamber," which has been extensively revised from his original work, all of which are carefully considered and admirable. Among them, there is a discussion involving the phrase "Returning the Blessing," which states:</p>
<p>"In the section 'Early Completion of Secret Appointments,' Wang Boliang's version makes this sentence 'Monks often return the blessing of secret appointments.' It should follow Huang Shangu's poem 'I haven't drunk alcohol for ten days due to illness, returning the blessing of youth to later generations.' Ren's note: 'Returning the blessing is probably a Buddhist term. Liu Yuxi's poem: Infinite joy and glory, temporarily return the blessing to young people.'"</p>
<p>According to this, "returning the blessing" is indeed a Buddhist term, and Shangu's poem comes from Liu Yuxi, which is true. However, the sentence in the Western Chamber may not directly use Shangu's poem. Many Song Dynasty collections have used this term, which was common language at the time. Jiang Baishi's poem to Yang Chengzhai says: "Sir, you only have three thousand poems, returning the blessing of the twilight clouds of Jiangdong." The ancestral hall version makes it "dragging back the twilight clouds of Jiangdong," and Hong Gaohua's version makes it "looking back at the twilight clouds of Jiangdong," both of which have lost the original meaning and are therefore falsely modified.</p>
<p>Tao Zhu's Unrecorded Notes record: "Fifteen miles north of Yingyang County, Henan, there is a mountain called Yi Bo Mountain with a cave like three rooms. In the cave, there is a pond, and the water is unfathomable. Those who live here usually stay for no more than a month, and strange things are bound to happen, causing terror and departure. Later, a monk came to live there. One day, while reciting the Lotus Sutra at his desk, suddenly the water in the pond moved, but he thought it was a sign of rain. Suddenly, a white snake emerged from the water, as large as a beam, and approached the monk, circling around him to the left, as high as a chair. The monk was terrified and entered the room, closing the door. Peeking through the crack, the monk had no choice but to loudly say: 'The Dragon King's appearance must be to hear the Sutra. This old monk will lecture on this chapter for the Dragon King.' After finishing, the returning the blessing was barely completed, and the snake entered the pond, circling to the right along the path."</p>
<p>According to this record, returning the blessing seems to have originally been a Buddhist ritual. After lecturing on the Sutra, it was customary to return the blessing. Gao Jiuwan's poem on the Qixi Festival says: "Double stars return the blessing to children, allowing me to fast before the embroidered Buddha." And "Miscellaneous Leisurely Sayings" says: "The wind and floral fragrance are clear, lower the curtain and don't release them, returning the blessing of Buddhist karma, offering this old poetic spirit." Also, Ye Jingwen's poem in the monk's house in Qinghui Pavilion says: "The monk returns the blessing of leisure offerings, placing a tea bowl in the fragrance of orchids and irises." These are all examples of the use of the phrase "returning the blessing" in the poems of the Southern Song Dynasty. Yao Mu'an's "Candlelight Shaking Red" lyrics say: "I wish the blue window could slow down the flow of light, borrowing the sleeves, returning the blessing to the new studio." Then, the Yuan Dynasty still used this phrase. Shi Yuanlong's poem in Huating, "Begging for Alms," says: "Explaining the Sutra to repay the price of rice, returning the blessing aligns with ordinary emotions." Then, people in the early Qing Dynasty still used this phrase in their poems. Generally, common people give monks money and goods, and the monks take only what they need, returning the rest to the givers, which is probably the meaning of returning the blessing. Today, when people in Hangzhou give gifts during the year, they usually return a small amount, called "returning a little," which is probably a transformation of "returning the blessing." From this, it can be seen that "returning the blessing" means "returning a gift" or "repaying." It originates from Buddhism, and its meaning is knowable, but its ritual is unknowable.</p>
<h3>Manwang Cave - Travelogue of Jia Prefecture</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>Regarding this Manwang Cave, some say it is from the Han Dynasty. Before there is a way to verify whether it is true or false, I think it is interesting to visit it as a strange place. I heard that there is a larger Quanwang Cave in the northwest suburbs outside Jia Prefecture City. My friend and I took advantage of a sunny autumn day for a walk and went from the fields, passing several small streams and wooden bridges, behind the village, at the foot of a low hill, and found the Manwang Cave.</p>
<p>This is a kind of construction of primitive human dwellings. A cave is carved out of the side of a stone mountain. The cave door is square, and the height and width of many caves are about three zhang and one zhang. The stone above the cave entrance is mostly carved with patterns, and some are carved with the name of the cave the size of a tabletop. Needless to say, this is the pattern of later busybodies. Inside some caves, figures are carved in relief on the stone walls. From the appearance and the method of carving, one can also discern its primitiveness.</p>
<p>After passing a wooden house feeding cattle, walking past the bodies of many water buffalo standing in the way, we saw from afar that Manwang Cave stood darkly on the mountain. Climbing up the earthen slope, we saw the true nature of these caves. They were purely carved from the yellow stones on the mountain. The reason why they were not completely covered by trees is that they have become "historical sites," and many later generations often come here to explore, just like unattended ancient temples, with the doorway overgrown with kudzu vines and ancient grasses.</p>
<p>I walked up the earthen slope to explore a more majestic cave. The three huge characters "Baiyun Cave" in a dangerous script were carved on the stone wall at the cave entrance. This cave door stands side by side, but the inside is actually an open and interconnected cave. In the stone enclosure, there is a place the size of a household affair. There are many inscriptions on the stone walls. I wanted to find the history of this cave from the words of this inscription, but those words were only records of later generations visiting here, and were really unrelated to the cave itself. I smiled to myself in vain, feeling that I was the same as these Tang and Song people who left their names and records, unable to know the origin of this cave. I thought that the people who knew the origin of this cave would definitely not recognize these clerical and regular scripts, because this cave was probably carved out an unknown number of years before these scripts were produced.</p>
<p>The back wall of this cave, like two doors for people to enter and exit on a stage, has two smaller caves standing on the left and right. Inside these caves are two deep tunnels. The depths of the tunnels obviously slope downwards. There are still places I want to go into, but fear stopped my legs. Although I guessed that there would be no wild animals inside, many imaginings of being alone in the stone caves of this deserted mountain really made me dare not go any further. In the stone ground I walked on, a stone crack opened, revealing that there was still a stone room below the stone ground, and there were stone-made objects that seemed to be used for water storage. On the walls of each cave entrance, there are deeply carved stone depressions, which seem to be used for embedding wooden tenons. The square edges of the stone doors are carved with simple patterns, making one imagine that the humans who initially used this as a room carefully designed their living space, and the overall structure of this cave is actually the prototype of later Chinese houses.</p>
<p>Several banana trees were specially planted at this cave entrance. I was very surprised why this kind of garden design of later generations would be added to the entrance of this desolate cave. Later, according to a friend, this was the remnant of an officer who took refuge here during the bombing during the Anti-Japanese War. The green banana trees could both protect the cave door and provide shade, so the officer used this cave as a place to avoid danger, or perhaps to study Sun Tzu's Art of War and infantry drill manuals. Our ancestors really planned too carefully for their descendants.</p>
<p>Around the foot of the mountain of this cave, about half a mile away, there is an even larger cave. A large stone wall stands smoothly on the equally smooth stone slope, and three caves almost the size of city gates are carved out. From a distance, it really has the feeling of a city gate, but this has been blocked by an earthen slope. Even the square cave doors that can only be seen inside are covered by earthen mounds. The interior structure of this cave is really unknown. This cave and the cave with banana trees at the entrance stand on opposite sides of the mountain. I guess that the insides of these two caves may have connecting places. If archaeologists are willing to excavate here, or there may be connecting places, if archaeologists are willing to excavate in here, or they may discover many historical proofs.</p>
<p>In addition to these two larger caves, there are many such smaller caves on the nearby mountains. From the shape of these caves, one can imagine the situation of ancient cave dwellings. Now, these caves have been buried in barren mountains. After being tired of wandering, when leaving these barren mountains and walking back again, seeing today's suburbs and cities, it seems that I have stretched my life upwards, walking in history, and placing myself between ancient and modern times.</p>
<h3>Lichee Poem</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>"Changan looking to make into a pile, the top of mountain thousand doors gradually open, a riding red dust concubine smiling, no one knows it is lichee coming." This is Du Mu's writing, Qing Palace time also. According to the New Tang History Yang Guifei Biography: The concubine loved lichees, and must have them delivered fresh. So riders were sent to deliver them, traveling thousands of miles. Before the taste changed, they had arrived in the capital. Du's poem probably sings about this. Old Study Hermitage Records records that Emperor Huizong planted lichees that bore fruit under the Baohe Hall during the Xuanhe period, and Emperor Huizong personally picked them to give to Yan commander Wang Anzhong, and also gave them a poem: "Baohe Hall's lichees are red, civil and military officials are given hundreds, thinking to share this taste with court ministers, red dust flies quickly past Yanshan," the last sentence uses Du's meaning.</p>
<h3>Call</h3>
<p>— Written by Polish A. Asnyk, Translated by Chen Mei</p>
<p>Outside the storm, there is a call from time to time,</p>
<p>Floating to those thoughtless, wicked, and fat ears.</p>
<p>Floating to those leaders enslaved by lies,</p>
<p>A call acting strangely in the wilderness.</p>
<p>It pierces the heart like an unexpected thought,</p>
<p>But no one jumps up from bed;</p>
<p>People shudder, like murderers just caught,</p>
<p>But pay no attention to what the call says.</p>
<p>Because no one can understand or hear</p>
<p>The call howling outside the scenery;</p>
<p>They turn over and fall into a soft sleep again,</p>
<p>And never dream of repentance and reform.</p>
<p>Adam Asnyk (1838-1897), a Polish poet. Born in Kalisz, he studied medicine in Warsaw and Heidelberg, Germany. After graduating, he practiced medicine in Laucheng. After 1870, he practiced medicine in Krakow. He wrote poetry in his spare time, mostly inclined to philosophy. The general reader thinks that Chen's meaning is too high. This chapter is translated from "Polish Lyrical Poetry Treasury", edited by Kou Kang Nai'er, published by Canadian Polish Printing House.</p>
<h3>Autumn Hu Teasing His Wife - Woodcut of the Ming Dynasty</h3>

<h3>Reading Paintings by Tian Jiweng</h3>
<p>— Wu Lifu</p>
<p>The art of painting, character, and the process of painting by Tian Jiweng, a famous landscape painter from Shanyin, have already been introduced in an article by my cousin Huang Hua. Yesterday, I went to the Chinese Painting Academy to visit Jiweng's painting exhibition. I felt that his style was close to several painters from the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, and he was particularly rich in comprehensive power. Now I will try to analyze it. This is also a method of reading paintings, and it is worth discussing with people who appreciate art.</p>
<p>Jiweng's composition is also very dense, with not much blank space on the screen. He takes inspiration from Luntai and Shigu, with clear veins, close to Luntai, and intentionally loose, close to Shigu. Jiweng's brushwork is divided into three types: one tends to be thick and layered, using the method of Long Banqian; one strives for sharpness and strength, which is close to Lan Tianshu; and one intends to be sparse and elegant, with many edges and corners, quite similar to Wang Shigu. As for coloring, it is mainly based on light ochre.</p>
<p>Jiweng has given a harmonious integration of the faces of these Ming and Qing masters in his works, and his main reliance is on the point method. His points follow the method of Zhonggui, and occasionally use Er Mi. For example, in the large painting "Spring Mountain Desiring Rain," the overlapping cloud mountains in the upper half are purely made of Mi dots, and the pine stones and flowing springs in the lower half are dedicated to learning from Diersou, and it is indeed not easy to achieve a complete atmosphere. As for what I like the most, it is two small paintings, one learning Luntai's "Spring Dawn at Lake Village" and one learning Yunlin while also learning Xiangbi's "Distant Cen on the Shore."</p>
<p>Such an analysis may be very mechanical. I also hope that Jiweng and connoisseurs will give me guidance.</p>
<h3>In the Mire</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>In the mire of the city, I am a sufferer of the soul.</p>
<p>Like a fish that has lost water, on a starless and moonless winter night, I am deeply mired in the mire of sin. Although my conscience has not yet fallen asleep, I am already covered in mud. Swallowing dirty mud, I follow those mudskippers who are good at maneuvering, tumbling in the mire, looking for nutritious food... Just living like this, painfully and helplessly -</p>
<p>My pen has long been no longer irrigating on my manuscript paper for my soul, because the source of that conscience has also become turbid, and no drop of water has become a mud spring; ah! My conscience's mud spring, which cannot be drawn from, as a me who is unwilling to drown myself, can I forever fall into degradation for the sake of rice and millet?</p>
<p>However, the night is so deep, without a star to accompany me, without the peaceful scene of roosters crowing and dogs barking. Even though I see more, I think more. How will I use this withered pen?</p>
<p>In the mire of the city, I illuminate the lamp of conscience and wander everywhere. I see how the people in the bitter and sinking world are living numbly and numbly. I cannot but feel that I am not prepared enough.</p>
<p>Originally, a person who can visualize life from observation, the sparks of his thoughts are always smoking, and the source of his wisdom will never run dry; I have always considered and expected myself to be a person who can think, but in such a mire, because of an accidental "fall", the source of conscience has become defiled, not to mention drawing water from here to irrigate, even I myself am unwilling to draw a drop to drink.</p>
<p>I tumbled helplessly in this mire. I saw how the "operators" whose gorgeous clothes were covered with thick mud were breathing with their lungs, but in fact, I was also forced to breathe like this, experiencing with my mouth instead of my soul.</p>
<p>From this small point of feeling, I understand how some people live. The deeper they fall, the greater the pain, and at the same time, they cannot make a sound, because the muddy conscience has no more reaction, like a mudskipper, which is originally a cold-blooded animal -</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't think the city is a big pot. In the boiling mud, these suffering mudskippers endure pain and exclude each other. Perhaps some people think that they can't make a sound of pain, so they think that they enjoy this kind of life, but that's wrong. I know that the reason why they have no sound is precisely because this is an era that does not allow sound.</p>
<p>Will there never be a sound made like this forever? I believe that it will not be too long. Mudskippers originally have vocal organs, and although the power of tumbling is weak, it will eventually turn this big pot over because of excessive extortion. Yes, at that time, people will go to places without fire, and the road will also be trodden out by people's feet.</p>

<h3>Recent World of Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>A New Study of the Brontës</p>
<p>Recently, England seems to be quite interested in the female writer Brontë. First, the Pilot Press published "Novels by the Brontë Sisters," priced at sixteen shillings. This collection includes Charlotte's "Jane Eyre," Emily's "Wuthering Heights," and Anne's "Agnes Grey."</p>
<p>Phyllis Bentley, herself a novelist from Yorkshire, wrote a book titled "The Brontë Sisters" for the British Novelists series. It begins by describing their family environment and upbringing, then narrates their lives and works separately, concluding with the position of this commendable family in English literature.</p>
<p>They are the admirable trio of the capable and decisive Charlotte, the unique Emily, and the gentle and respectful Anne. Modern times also have such a trio, namely the Sitwell family, with Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell.</p>
<p>In the Brontë family, we cannot forget Branwell. Their father had six children, but only Branwell was a son, the other five being daughters. The eldest two sisters died early, the third sister was Charlotte, Branwell was the fourth child, Emily was the fifth, and Anne was the sixth. Although Branwell was also a writer and artist, he did not achieve much. He was the failure of the family, the weakest member, only bringing shame and sorrow to the family. Did he drink because he was ashamed of not being able to keep up with his sisters' genius? Without Branwell, would they have been able to write masterpieces? Would Charlotte have been so capable and confident? Would Emily have reached such depths of despair and pity? Would the most honest and benevolent Anne have written about the chronic suicide of a drunkard in Wildfell Hall? Strangely, Branwell was indeed necessary for the development of their genius; without him, there would have been no masterpieces.</p>
<p>Bentley traced the origins of the Brontë sisters' literary flowering, saying that they were originally Celts who later moved to Yorkshire. Bentley said that although they wrote about Yorkshire, their attitude was Celtic. They wrote about the Yorkshire they knew, and they wrote it as well as it could be written, but what they brought us was the Irish tradition of "sentiment, poetry, fire, and ice." This biography is rich in material and meticulous in its records. It emphasizes the importance of the family's dream world and writes about many sources of their works.</p>
<p>Lang's "English Literature" states: "Charlotte (1816-1855) wanted to depict her novels as social realism. She added a passionate essence to Thackeray's realism, with a touch of unbalanced romanticism. The latter was partly an expression of Charlotte's own nature and partly the result of her lonely and sad life, which was darkened by constant family tragedies. This will help us understand her work if we remember that Charlotte and her sister Emily turned to literature because they found their work as teachers unbearable and wanted to create a new world of fantasy to relieve the loneliness and sadness of their own fate. However, in this new world, the sadness of thought remained, so there was a painful heart behind all of Charlotte's novels. Charlotte's most famous work is 'Jane Eyre' (1847), which, despite its shortcomings, is a powerful study of essential love and hate, reminiscent of Marlowe's tragedies. This work was immediately praised by the public, and the author was listed among the leading living writers. In addition to the value of the novel itself, it is interesting that the first few chapters reflect the author's own life and experiences. 'Shirley' (1849) and 'Villette' (1853) are the three novels by this genius woman that are often remembered." Lang also said that Emily's (1818-1848) "Wuthering Heights" is about intense, morbid love and endurance. Arnold (M. Arnold) called her writing passionate, powerful, and sad, unmatched by anyone except [Lord] Byron. Charlotte has a detailed description of Emily in the novel "Shirley."</p>

<p>Thomas Mann Writes About Moses</p>
<p>After working hard to recreate the story of Joseph and his brothers, the German Thomas Mann is now recreating the story of Moses, which is smaller in quantity but not without similarities in nature. The story is called "The Tables of the Law." The original was published in a collection of essays written by various authors in 1945. The English translation was only recently published.</p>
<p>He uses reason to write about Moses and the establishment of the Ten Commandments, without any mythical elements. Moses is the child of Pharaoh's daughter. Thomas Mann gives rational explanations for all the miraculous or semi-miraculous events.</p>
<p>Based on his imagination, he says that Moses has a slightly hooked nose, speaks with a bit of a stutter, and has very strong arms. Thomas Mann's works have never been strongly stimulating when translated into English, but the translation of this novel is relatively fluent. The translator, who unfortunately remains anonymous, uses American dialects and idioms to make the story lively.</p>
<p>New Collection of Poems by Todd</p>
<p>Ruthven Todd is a new poet who emerged in England during the war. He has previously published the collections of poems "Until Now" (1942) and "Acreage of the Heart" (1945), as well as the novel "The Lost Traveller" (1944), and has also edited a biography of the poet Blake (1942). Now he has published this book, "The Planet in My Hand." He is rich in sensitive expression. He believes that although "man" is prone to tragedy, he also has great strength. He often sings about his love, his son, and his father. His "In Memory of Dad" says: "When I last saw him, lying restlessly in bed, I knew I had finally grown up. As long as I think of him, all my hatred and fear disappear."</p>
<p>He also has historical poems like Swift, but his best poem is "Edinburgh, 1940."</p>
<p>He often feels disillusioned and uneasy. At the beginning of the war, he sadly sang: "I appeal to the midsummer moon, what can I do? I want to avoid the torrent of history, where can I escape?"</p>

<h3>The Past and Present of Shanghai's Radio Broadcasting Industry</h3>
<p>— Shi Yingyang, Qian Zhixi</p>
<p>The Initial Stage</p>
<p>Radio broadcasting experiments by wireless radio scholars in Europe and the United States were declared successful in 1920 (the ninth year of the Republic of China). Radio stations were widely established, and the broadcasting of programs was effective. Two years later (the eleventh year of the Republic of China), a British Jew, E. C. Osborne, installed a 50-watt radio broadcasting station at the Dale &amp; Co. on Guangdong Road in Shanghai, with the call sign ECO, broadcasting news, lectures, music, and other programs. At the same time, an electrical appliance company (Electric Equipment &amp; Co.) was attached to an optical company on Nanjing Road to promote the sale of various electrical equipment through radio programs. However, the radio station's equipment was simple, the sound was unclear, and it failed to arouse interest from all walks of life. Therefore, the radio station and the company closed down in a few months. Thirteen years later, Delay, the manager of the American Kellogg Telephone Supplies Company, founded a radio station, broadcasting news, commercial information, church programs, celebrity lectures, and advertisements for the company's products, with the power increasing from 100 watts to 250 watts. In the sixteenth year, it stopped broadcasting due to low profits. However, broadcasting over the air lasted for three years, making it the first successful broadcaster in Shanghai during its initial stage. Subsequently, foreigners successively established radio stations, including Mei (XMHA), Qimei (XQHE), Datong (XQHA), the British merchant Qikai (i.e., the Robertson Radio Station) (XQHB), Meilington (XQHC), and the French merchant Falun (XFFZ), totaling six stations.</p>
<p>The Era of State-Owned and Private Enterprises</p>
<p>By the seventeenth year, China, seeing the rampant and endless proliferation of Western radio stations, began to operate its own radio stations. First, the former Beijing Ministry of Communications and the Northeast Wireless Radio Supervision Office successively established radio stations in Beijing, Tianjin, Fengtian, and Harbin. Later, the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters established the Central Broadcasting Administration. It initially established a powerful radio station in the capital (increasing from 500 watts to 50 kilowatts), followed by branch stations in important provinces and cities. At the same time, the Zhejiang Provincial Government also established a 1-kilowatt radio station. By the twenty-third year, the Ministry of Communications also established a station (XQHC) as an advocate.</p>
<p>With the government leading the way, private radio stations sprung up like mushrooms after the rain. In Shanghai alone, there were as many as forty or fifty stations. However, the quality of the equipment of each station varied, and they interfered with each other. Therefore, in the twenty-first year, the Ministry of Communications promulgated the Provisional Rules for the Administration of Private Radio Broadcasting Stations, stipulating that each station should first apply for registration and wait for inspection of the equipment. Those who passed the inspection would be granted a license before being allowed to establish a station and start broadcasting. The program content should focus on promoting education and culture, and commercial programs were severely restricted, not exceeding two-tenths of the daily broadcasting time. At that time, after several negotiations, all foreign radio stations, except for the French station, which insisted on its independence and refused to register, came to register. Subsequently, the Meilington and Qimei stations were revoked by the Ministry of Communications. The equipment of all Chinese merchant radio stations was inspected by personnel from the Ministry of Communications, and the programs were reviewed and handled by the Central Broadcasting Steering Committee. As a result of several years of supervision, the equipment of each station was gradually improved. However, there was a lack of good programs, and they competed to attract a large number of lengthy commercial advertisements with low-level entertainment programs, while the proportion of educational lectures and high-quality entertainment programs was not increased, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance Period</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year, the August 13th Incident of the War of Resistance broke out, and after three months of bloody fighting, the national army retreated, and the forty-odd private radio stations in Shanghai were in a state of chaos. The Chinese Mei and Qikai stations among the foreign stations were shut down after the Japanese invaded the concessions. The Datong station was sold to the Japanese and moved to the Huangpu Wharf, where it was bombed and destroyed by Allied aircraft. The French station continued broadcasting due to its relationship with the Vichy government. Some Chinese merchant radio stations, greedy for business, shamelessly served the enemy and continued broadcasting. Later, more than ten new radio stations were established and were collectively bought and controlled by the Japanese. However, the Linji and Heming stations stopped broadcasting due to being in the war zone in Nanshi. The other stations, such as Shanghai (i.e., Asia-America), Yuanchang, Huamei, Greater China, Mainland, and Oriental Gospel, automatically closed down after the national army retreated.</p>
<p>The Post-Victory Reorganization Period</p>
<p>In September of the thirty-fourth year, the War of Resistance was won. Before the restoration of various institutions of the central government was completed and the rules for the establishment of radio stations were promulgated by the Executive Yuan, Chinese and Western private and party-government-military institutions competed to establish radio stations, and the number increased daily. The broadcasting frequencies were crowded, and the equipment was mostly outdated and mismatched, causing abnormal problems, resulting in chaotic radio waves, mutual interference, and rough sound, which was unbearable to listen to. Although the garrison headquarters and the police department initially took temporary responsibility for management, they ultimately failed to achieve reorganization results because there were no suitable regulations to follow. It was not until March of the thirty-fifth year that this bureau promulgated the rules for the establishment of radio stations and first handled the registration of public and private radio stations as a preliminary reorganization. A total of 106 stations were found to have complied with the order to register. This bureau, together with the garrison headquarters and the police department, sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections of the transmitters and broadcasting equipment of each station. However, the quality of the equipment varied, so the three parties jointly determined the levels, listed them, and reported them to the Ministry of Communications. With approval, six stations, including China, Freedom, Asia, Cooperation, Jindou, Minsheng, and Jiujiu, were temporarily allowed to broadcast. Seven stations, including Chinese Culture, Jiancheng, Greater China, Datong, New Voice, New Shanghai, and Hezhong, were ordered to improve their machinery before being temporarily allowed to broadcast. Furthermore, radio stations that had voluntarily ceased operations during the War of Resistance and refused to register with the enemy and puppet regime were specially allowed to broadcast with priority, including Mainland, Greater China, Oriental, Huamei, Yuanchang, Heming, and Gospel. Subsequently, Xin Yun and Da Mei were also approved to broadcast. All of the above twenty stations used one frequency for every two stations, taking turns broadcasting to reduce the congestion and interference of frequencies. In addition, the Xindu station was approved to only broadcast meeting programs when the Municipal Council was in session, and broadcasting would be stopped after the meeting was adjourned. The Shanghai Radio Station, which was established by the former Central Broadcasting Administration, will be changed to a private enterprise, affiliated with the China Broadcasting Company, and is currently being organized and applied for in accordance with the law. This is the general situation of restoring order in the air after the recovery of the various stations. As for unscrupulous people who privately set up radio stations for the purpose of making profits by indiscriminately soliciting commercial advertisements and selling inferior goods, there are still many, and they are currently being investigated and cracked down on one after another, and it is expected that they will be cleared up soon.</p>
<p>Hopes for the Future</p>
<p>The radio broadcasting industry is a tool for promoting laws and decrees, developing culture, and enlightening the people. It should not be solely for the purpose of soliciting commercial advertisements and seeking profits as its main business. However, looking around today, the content of the programs of each station is largely similar. Not only are there many commercial programs in private party stations, but also many public radio stations privately broadcast commercial programs. Here are a few points, and it is hoped that each station will automatically improve: In terms of programs, emphasis should be placed on education and culture. In terms of educational transmission, songs, lyrics, and musical drama lyrics, we must take a high standard. Although popular, it should not be inelegant, and all obscene words and songs that are harmful to public morals should be eliminated. It is hoped that the education authorities will come forward to assist in rectifying and correcting the customs. As for commercial programs, we should strive to reduce the proportion. Currently, a single advertisement for commercial programs is broadcast, and even takes up to ten minutes or more. If three or four advertisements are broadcast at the same time, the time occupied is even more. Moreover, the words and sentences read in the advertisements are repeated over and over again, just like monks chanting scriptures, which only makes the audience bored and switch to other stations. As a result, the effectiveness of the advertisement is completely lost, and the merchant has been deceived and wasted money. In the past, the Ministry of Communications Radio Station signed up for various publicity advertisement programs, limiting each household to only two minutes of broadcasting, broadcasting once every half hour, and limiting each broadcast to three or four households at the same time, occupying only six to eight minutes. In the future, it seems that each station should imitate this, receiving concise advertisements that emphasize quality rather than quantity. Although the time occupied is short, the effect is great. If we intend to accept lengthy advertisements indiscriminately, which are not noticed by the general public, it is a self-deceiving act. We hope that each station will improve this. I checked the equipment of each station, and most of it is not yet perfect. As a result, we cannot eliminate the generation of sub-waves, the expansion of wave bands, and the noise of AC sound. Not only is the sound unpleasant, but mutual interference is also common. If the technical aspects continue in this way and are not improved, allowing the Shanghai radio waves to be disordered, it will hinder international viewing and listening and bring shame to the country. All of us in the wireless radio technology field also ask ourselves with shame, and especially hope that the person in charge of each station will pay attention and improve it.</p>
<h3>Everyone Has Something to Say</h3>
<p>— Su Yu</p>
<h3>Talking About Coastal Radio Stations</h3>
<p>— Sun Jizun</p>
<p>Coastal radio stations – except for shipping companies and a few people, they seem relatively unfamiliar to the general public, because everyone knows that the Telecommunications Bureau receives and sends domestic telegrams, and international radio stations receive and send foreign telegrams. But what about coastal radio stations? It is not very clear what they do. So today I will introduce the general idea of coastal radio stations to you, which I think you will be happy to hear.</p>
<p>A coastal radio station is an institution on land that specializes in communicating with ocean and inland river ships (equipped with wireless radio equipment). The purpose of its establishment is for maritime safety, so its biggest task is also biased towards maritime safety. Although it also accepts public communications and receives and sends telegrams to and from ships like the Telecommunications Bureau and international radio stations, this is a secondary task. Its main special tasks are roughly the following:</p>
<p>Listening for Distress Signals The work of a coastal radio station is a 24-hour system. Every minute of attention is devoted to listening, and in addition to receiving and sending a few telegrams, the most sacred and important task is to listen for distress and rescue signals (SOS) from ships (or airplanes, etc.) at sea. If this signal is heard, even if it is currently communicating, it will immediately stop and listen quietly to the distress message (including the name of the ship, its nationality, the date, time, and location of the distress – latitude and longitude – and the distress situation). It immediately notifies the relevant parties, such as the shipping company, the Jianghai Customs, the port authority, etc., and broadcasts it on their behalf, requesting nearby ships to go to the rescue until the danger is over.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Time Signals and Weather Forecasts Every day at a set time, time signals are sent to calibrate the time, and weather information is sent to allow ships in navigation to know the changes in the weather. In the typhoon season, if a storm is detected, it must be broadcast at all times so that ships in navigation know where to avoid it.</p>
<p>Issuing Navigation Warnings If anything dangerous to navigation is found in the ocean, broadcast it at any time, such as mines left over from wartime, or the discovery of reefs, or floating obstacles, and sunken ships, etc., as well as any obstacles or changes in the position of lighthouses and buoys in the navigation route, warnings must be sent at any time to prompt ships to pay attention to ensure safe navigation.</p>
<p>Navigation Status Reports Every day, the port of entry and exit of various ships, and the location of navigation in what place, how much distance apart, must be recorded for reference, and at the same time, because of this close contact with the ships that come and go, it is convenient and assured to exchange telegrams.</p>
<p>Epidemic Reports The announcement of an epidemic in a port that requires quarantine, will inform passengers to pay attention. If a passenger is ill, the coastal radio station can also transfer it to health and medical institutions for answers.</p>
<p>Broadcasting News, Direction Finding A fully equipped coastal radio station has these facilities that facilitates navigation and increases maritime safety.</p>
<p>The tasks mentioned above are the special tasks of coastal radio stations, which are completely free and voluntary services, and are mostly handled in advance. Ordinary telecommunications are secondary, so they put service first and business second, but the two are linked. The more attentive the service, the more developed the business. The soundness of the coastal radio station has a huge impact on aviation, and the equipment must be as complete as possible. Developed countries in Europe and the United States regard coastal radio stations as being related to navigation safety and to domestic and foreign affairs, and attach great importance to it.</p>
<p>Ship Telegrams All telegrams to and from coastal radio stations and ships, or between ships, are called ship telegrams, which are now divided into international ship telegrams and domestic ship telegrams.</p>
<p>International Ship Telegrams The way to calculate the cost of this telegram is the same as for international telegrams, calculated according to the gold franc, ninety centimes per word, including fifty centimes for the coastal fee (calculated according to the current franc exchange rate, recently adjusted from October 13 this year to 18,000 yuan per gold franc), and forty centimes for the ship fee. Both Chinese and foreign languages are the same, but there is no "urgent telegram" category. If the code CDE is used, it is calculated at six-tenths.</p>
<p>Domestic Ship Telegrams All ships of this country that have been approved by the Ministry of Communications to issue wireless radio station certificates and call signs can calculate the cost of domestic ship telegrams. The current price is 1,500 yuan per word for Chinese and vernacular, including 1,000 yuan for the domestic telegram fee and 500 yuan for the ship telegram fee. Foreign languages or codes are calculated at twice the price, and urgent telegrams are calculated at twice the price of ordinary telegrams. The ship fee is still charged according to the ordinary telegram fee.</p>
<p>The existing coastal radio stations in China are Tianjin XSV, Qingdao XST, and Yingkou XSD in the north, Shanghai XSG in the central region, and Tainan XSW, Keelung XSX, and Hualien Port XSY in the south. The riverbank radio stations along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are Nanjing XSM, Jiujiang XSK, Hankou XSN, Yichang XSO, and Chongqing XSP. The business office of the Shanghai Coastal Radio Station is located at 25 Changzhi Road in this city, telephone 44882–45747.</p>
<p>Coastal radio stations that are being planned are Qinhuangdao XSV3, Huludao XSV4, Yantai XSC, Lianyungang XST3, Guangzhou XSQ, Shantou XSQ3, Haikou XSQ4, Fuzhou XSL, Xiamen XSL2, Yongjia XSL3, Ningbo XSR2, and riverbank radio stations are Hangzhou XSR, Zhenjiang XSM3, Wuhu XSM4, XSG2, Changsha XSN3, Yueyang XSN4, Shashi XSO2, and Wanxian XSP3.</p>
<p>People in our country, except for shipping companies, rarely use ship telegrams. If you have relatives and friends traveling on ships, and you want to know where they are traveling and when they will arrive, or if you have urgent matters that you want them to know immediately, as well as people who are guests on ships and have something to communicate with their families or relatives and friends, and even to contact official business and inquire about commercial information, you can send a few ship telegrams, and the coastal radio station will provide you with loyal and practical services. Then, even if they are separated by the ocean, in different places, and thousands of miles apart, it is as if they are facing each other. The so-called "a little spiritual rhinoceros penetrates to each other," and when the telegram arrives, it is as if they are facing each other in the same room.</p>

<h3>Talk on Common Telegraph Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 3 How to Choose Special Services</p>
<p>The above three types of special services have relatively widespread uses. The following types have narrower uses. To save space, we will discuss them more simply.</p>
<p>Delivery Confirmation Before discussing the main topic, please think in advance: Under what circumstances should we use "double registration" when mailing items? As far as the author knows, in various countries in Europe and America (especially the United States), because the postal service is reliable, ordinary mail is usually sent by regular mail. Unless it is particularly important, "single registration" is rarely used. As for double registered mail, unless the sender wants to obtain a double registered receipt as legal evidence, it is not easily sent. Taking the handling of telegrams as an example, when the sender submits any type of telegram, the telegraph office must issue a telegraph receipt. If the telegram cannot be delivered, the telegraph office is responsible for notifying the sender. The handling procedure is more thorough than sending regular mail. In other words, if the sender does not receive a notice from the telegraph office regarding non-delivery after the telegram is sent, it confirms that the telegram has been delivered accurately and can be assured without worry. Therefore, regarding the "delivery confirmation" special service, which is similar in nature to "registered" mail, the author believes that unless: 1. The sender wants to obtain "delivery confirmation" as legal evidence; or 2. Due to special reasons (such as natural disasters or war in the receiving area, causing difficulties in telecommunications, etc.), the telegraph office announces that it is not responsible for delays or non-delivery of telegrams to that area, senders may consider using the "delivery confirmation" special service for prudence. Otherwise, there is usually no need to choose this special service.</p>
<p>Delivery confirmation is divided into delivery notification by telegram (identified as PC) and delivery notification by letter (identified as PCP). The former means that after the receiving telegraph office delivers the telegram, it notifies the sending telegraph office of the delivery date and time, which is then forwarded to the original sender. The fee for the delivery notification by telegram special service is the original telegram fee plus six words at the ordinary telegram rate. The latter means that after the telegram is delivered, the receiving telegraph office uses mail to notify the sending telegraph office of the delivery date and time, which is then forwarded to the original sender. In addition to the telegram fee itself, a single registered letter postage is added according to the post office regulations.</p>
<p>Special Delivery In principle, telegraph offices do not charge for delivering telegrams (except for express telegrams). However, for telegrams delivered to recipients who live far from the urban area or city center, the telegraph office must send a special messenger, which requires more manpower. Therefore, recipients must be charged a special delivery fee.</p>
<p>Each telegraph office has a free delivery area for ordinary telegrams. According to usual regulations, ordinary telegrams delivered within the city, within the city walls, or within two kilometers of the urban area or city walls are not subject to delivery fees.</p>
<p>For telegrams where the recipient lives outside the free delivery area of the receiving telegraph office but within forty kilometers of the telegraph office location, if the sender indicates "special delivery" or the =EXPRESS= identifier in the telegram header, the receiving telegraph office can send a special messenger. Otherwise, after receiving the telegram, unless the recipient living outside the free delivery area has a large number of telegrams on weekdays and agrees to send someone to the telegraph office at a fixed time every day to collect them, the telegram will be delivered by the post office and no special messenger will be sent.</p>
<p>According to regulations, the special delivery fee must be collected from the recipient. Starting from the telegraph office or business office that dispatches the telegram, one unit of special delivery fee is charged for distances not exceeding ten kilometers, and one unit is added for each additional one to five kilometers. The unit price of the special delivery fee is calculated based on one-fourth of the daily wage of a local worker. Therefore, the fees charged by telegraph offices vary from place to place.</p>
<p>Based on the above regulations, when a sender prepares to send a telegram to a recipient and knows that the recipient's address is outside the free delivery area of the receiving telegraph office, they should consider in advance. If they believe that the local rural postal service delivers quickly, there is no need to add the "special delivery" identifier in the telegram header. Conversely, if it is deemed necessary to request the receiving telegraph office to send a special messenger, this identifier can be added to the telegram header. However, labor costs have recently become expensive, and the special delivery fee is calculated based on labor costs and is required to be paid by the recipient. Therefore, before adding the "special delivery" identifier, the recipient's burden must also be considered.</p>
<p>Forwarding The forwarding special service is best used for telegrams sent to travelers. There are two ways to use the forwarding special service. First, for telegrams sent to travelers, if you know in advance the places they will arrive at and the addresses where they plan to stay after arriving at each place, but cannot determine where the recipient has arrived, you can list the place names and addresses of each arrival place one by one and add the "forward" or =FS= identifier in the telegram header. For example: The general manager, Huang Renfeng, of the Shanghai Dazhong Bank's head office is departing from Shanghai to inspect the business of the bank's Nanjing, Hankou, and Chongqing branch offices. There is an important matter in Shanghai that requires sending him a telegram, but it cannot be determined where the recipient has arrived. In this case, simply indicate the =FS= identifier in the telegram header and list the addresses in various places as follows:</p>
<p>=FS= Huang Renfeng, Dazhong Bank, Zhongshan East Road, Nanjing = Dazhong Bank, Hubei Road, Hankou = Dazhong Bank, Zhongshan First Road, Chongqing = (followed by the text of the telegram and signature)</p>
<p>After the Nanjing Telegraph Office receives this telegram from Shanghai, it will immediately inquire with the Nanjing Dazhong Bank whether the recipient is currently in Nanjing. If he has already left, the original telegram will be forwarded to Hankou for attempted delivery. The Hankou Telegraph Office will also handle it in the same way, until the telegram is delivered. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Lamenting the Money Class</h3>
<p>— Meng Nong</p>
<p>Egyptian Queen Cleopatra was famous for her extravagant lifestyle. She liked to drink special wines, and it is said that there were four pearls at the bottom of the wine bottle.</p>
<p>In ancient Roman times, emperors also went to great lengths to be extravagant. They used peacock brains and tongues to make sandwiches as food.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, today's money class cannot enjoy these things, no matter how much money you have. Because this is a bygone era. Now, apart from ham sandwiches, beef sandwiches, etc., where can you enjoy antique peacock brain sandwiches? And how can you eat more banquets than your great chefs?</p>
<p>Furthermore, watching a play is a form of enjoyment in life, and so is wearing clothes. True, it is indeed enjoyment. However, can you, the money class, wear two or three sets of beautiful suits and overcoats at the same time? Can you watch consecutive performances in two or three theaters in one night?</p>
<p>It is futile to hope that you enjoy the unnecessary huge wealth because you like money. This is like asking the children of a candy factory to work two hours more every day because the children like to eat candy, because having money does not necessarily mean you can enjoy everything. Not everything can be bought or enjoyed with money. This situation is like the children of the candy factory having candy in the factory but not being able to eat it.</p>
<p>The salaried class is different. If they can get double the salary, their enjoyment in life will also double. An income of 10 million yuan per month is indeed twice as enjoyable as 5 million yuan. But the money class is different. They roll, roll, roll their money every day into a huge number that they themselves cannot accurately estimate. But what relationship does this large amount of money have with their enjoyment of life? I believe that natural limitations have long given a certain limit to the enjoyment of life, and the money class is far above this limit, and enjoyment becomes fantasy. They fantasize about this and that, like the glass merchant Alnaschar in "One Thousand and One Nights," fantasizing that one day, they will marry a queen-like wife, and in front of her, they will show off their power, put on airs, lose their temper, and kick her out. With this kick, they shattered their dreams and fantasies! It turned out that he was not kicking his "queen," but kicking his wealth (glassware), the glass shattered into pieces, and all the wealth was gone!</p>
<p>A gold ring may decorate you, but countless gold bars will only bind you and restrict you. A big meal can fill your stomach and provide you with the necessary nutrition, but if you eat one meal after another, and eat too much, not only will you not be able to digest it, but your stomach will probably be damaged. For the money class who have eaten too much and damaged their stomachs, and have been imprisoned, will anyone sympathize with them? On the contrary, those who deserve pity or sympathy are those poor people who are exposed to the cold wind and cannot get enough food and clothing, including some of the salaried class. Will the confiscated money give those suffering people a little of the food and clothing they deserve? I am thinking about this.</p>
<h3>I Do Not Choose Freedom</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>I saw a strange book in the advertisement of paintings and books in the newspaper, called "I Chose Freedom." I don't know what the content is, why did that person choose freedom? Which things did he choose from? If it were me, then if someone listed two other things besides freedom, such as arsenic, and ordered me to choose, then I would of course choose freedom, but if arsenic were replaced by rice cakes and bread, and listed alongside freedom, and ordered me to choose, to be honest, I would necessarily give up freedom and choose rice cakes or bread, if this choice is to let me choose freely.</p>
<p>Because the freedom that people talk about from ancient times to the present refers to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association. Freedom of love and freedom of marriage are not included, and freedom to eat bread and freedom to eat rice are even more insignificant and excluded from the topic, so I have no intention of choosing freedom. Originally, among the three major freedoms of speech, assembly, and society, I fundamentally dislike the latter two. Gathering many Zhang Sans, Li Sis, Sun Qis, and Huang Bas in one place, everyone says their own reasoning, opinions are never easy to agree on, conclusions are never easy to reach, and besides wasting time, losing work, and wasting money, there is nothing good, so I should say that assembly should be included in thrift, at least as difficult as newspapers and banquets. Association is also a similar thing. After the labor of association, the contribution will not exceed the amateur actors' use of "I am like" a few sentences of a certain society or a certain society.</p>
<p>I originally had some interest in freedom of speech. But recently, my interest has waned, and soon I will probably lose interest. Because I have already felt that if freedom of speech refers to just talking, I am already free enough. Every day, I don't know how many discussions I have with my family and friends, about the size of flies, the subtlety of the universe, speaking freely, and casually speaking, who will come to prohibit or interfere with me? The Hyde Park in London has speeches by various parties and factions, which the world regards as the foundation of British democracy. Thinking about it carefully, I really find it funny. The audience is not more numerous than my family and friends, and their intention is no different from our watching street performances. Moreover, in the final analysis, no matter how long the history of speeches in Hyde Park is, Britain is still only the Conservative Party and the Labour Party plus the Liberal Party this little braid. What contribution does it make to the country and the world? As for freedom of speech in writing, I think the fact is: if you want to freely publish your grand theories, you can start your own newspaper or magazine, otherwise this freedom is not for you. Because it is difficult for you to publish your great works advocating liberalism in newspapers and magazines that advocate illiberalism, and how can you publicize your great articles opposing liberalism in newspapers and magazines that advocate liberalism? It turns out that the freedom that a certain group or a certain newspaper righteously and vehemently strives for is the freedom of that group or that newspaper, and it has nothing to do with you who are not their own people. The examples of this are not uncommon throughout history, both at home and abroad. If you don't believe it, read history.</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not choose freedom, if I also have the freedom to choose what I love.</p>
<h3>Chinese Grammar</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>Chinese characters, saying that they have no grammar, it is not completely without it, saying that they have grammar, but you cannot say a system. This may be because it has not been studied in detail. However, recent people who talk about Chinese grammar mostly take English grammar as the standard and use it to restrain Chinese, which may not always be appropriate. It must be known that English has English grammar, French has French grammar, and German and Russian have German and Russian grammar. Those who speak of English grammar do not initially restrain English with the grammar of French, German, and Russian, and those who speak of French, German, and Russian grammar do not initially restrain French, German, and Russian with the grammar of other countries. Then why must one uniquely restrain Chinese grammar with the grammar of other countries?</p>
<p>I intend to speak of Chinese grammar, and I must take Chinese itself as the foundation, and then supplement it with the grammar of other languages as a reference, so that the correctness of Chinese grammar can be obtained. There are many sentence structures in Chinese, which, if measured by English grammar, may not meet the standard, but reading them is "smooth." For example, the phrase "yelling like killing a pig," according to English grammar, must be changed to "yelling like a pig being killed." Another example is the phrase "stick beats unfaithful man." According to a purely English grammar explanation, this stick must be able to fly automatically.</p>
<p>Extending this to philosophy, Hu Shi's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy, Volume 1" takes American modern experimentalism as the standard and uses it to evaluate Chinese philosophy. Many scholars believe that this is looking at Chinese philosophy through colored glasses, criticizing it for failing to grasp the correctness of Chinese philosophy. Feng Youlan's "History of Chinese Philosophy" speaks of a certain philosopher's philosophy from the perspective of that philosopher, following the principle of "interpreting the classics with the classics." Chen Yinque commented on Feng's book, saying, "...those who are called understanding must roam in meditation and be in the same realm as the ancient people who established the theory, and express a kind of sympathy for the painstaking efforts of their arguments that had to be so, in order to criticize the merits and demerits of their theories, and without any obstacles or superficial discussions. Otherwise, the old sayings of thousands of years ago are very different from today's situation, what can not be laughed at and regarded as strange?" He also said: "...today, those who talk about ancient Chinese philosophy mostly talk about their own philosophy today; the history of Chinese philosophy they write is their own philosophy history today. The more organized and systematic their arguments are, the farther they deviate from the truth of the ancient people's theories..."</p>
<p>Extending this to economics, if one does not take the current economic situation as the object and uses several old "methods" as the reality, then the more one talks about economics, the more impossible it is to have any solution. Extending this to politics, if one does not take the political situation as the object to govern, but only knows how to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, the more chaotic the politics will naturally become.</p>
<h3>Notes in Sickness</h3>
<p>— Ji Er</p>
<p>When the cold wave is coming but has not yet arrived, I, who am running around in the wind, have caught a cold. My cough is intermittent, and my mood is also very uneasy. I am indeed somewhat sick in both body and mind.</p>
<p>I am lying in bed sick during the New Year. In the blink of an eye, the price of rice has broken through the 1.5 million yuan mark. The red market is rising, and prices of everything are soaring. The newspapers are full of dazzling triangles. But today, when colleagues meet, everyone laughs and takes it for granted. This indifferent mood is quite sad. However, things always have two sides. The day before yesterday, someone from my hometown came and talked about the lives of the farmers in my hometown this year, and I was very happy. It is said that the market in the countryside is particularly good this year, and the department stores are full of farmers. It turns out that last year, it took more than one load of rice to exchange for one pound of wool, but this year, one load of rice can be exchanged for more than two pounds of wool. He excitedly said, "This is a big difference." I then suddenly realized the meaning of the saying "killing the cheap hurts the farmers."</p>
<p>The above does not mean to support price increases, but only to point out how different people's hopes are. Originally, adults have adults' hopes, and children have children's hopes; capitalists have capitalists' hopes, and workers have workers' hopes; merchants have merchants' hopes, and farmers have farmers' hopes... How can everything be as one wishes?</p>
<p>People who have lived in the city for a long time may not easily understand the lives of the people in various places that the city relies on as a "distribution center." All the people they come into contact with from various places seem to be "refugees." In fact, there are many people who live and work in peace and contentment on this vast land! For example, my hometown is in the triangle between the Jinghu and Huhang railways, the so-called land of fish and rice. Thousands upon thousands of people are farmers. As long as there are fish to catch and rice to harvest, they can live and work in peace and contentment. This year, they have not been destroyed by artillery fire, so they have recovered a little of the previous hustle and bustle, and they are still happy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what about me, this poor civil servant? I see that all public utilities have begun to apply the formula of "automatic adjustment" - and the adjustment of treatment that I am looking forward to still requires three months at a time. I don't have much hope while I am sick, but I hope that everything will have an "automatic adjustment" formula that can be applied in the future, so that I can be at peace in both body and mind.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Misfortunes Never Come Singly (41)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai saw that she kept saying she was waiting, and there were many sufferings in her heart that she could not express, so she just reluctantly agreed. After Qi Wan said this, she did not mention it again. Then she told Zhu Zhai about what had happened during the street performance in Jinan Road, and said that after the street performance in Jinan, she would have to go to Qingdao for another street performance. She herself was unwilling to go, but in order to plan for future living expenses, she had to go. She said: "I hope that after the performances in Jinan and Qingdao, the remaining money can be used to buy a slightly decent house, and the remaining money can be used for living expenses, so that I can live a peaceful life." Zhu Zhai saw that she was in high spirits and that everything she said was optimistic, so he did not say anything more. That day, the two of them only talked for two hours. He Zhou had already sent people to urge her several times. Qi Wan had many household affairs to discuss with He Zhou, so she could not delay any longer. When she left, she only told Zhu Zhai: "I will always remember what you said that night. I am waiting for you. I think that when I come back this time, our affairs will have already been resolved." As she said this, she shook Zhu Zhai's hand several times and left. When Zhu Zhai returned home, he felt that this matter was very difficult to handle. Qi Wan's friendship with him had evolved to this point. It was impossible not to divorce his wife. However, everyone in his family, starting with his father, would definitely not agree with this divorce issue. Once it was mentioned, they would definitely all object. To handle this matter, he had to get Feng Sheng to take the initiative to file for divorce. Feng Sheng was also the most stubborn woman. If she had not been greatly stimulated, she would never have such an action. He was the most indecisive person, with the softest ears, and loved to listen to gossip. Someone had to provoke her from the inside in order to brew a marital change. Now, who should he use? That was another problem. After thinking for a long time, he thought of Zhang Yunqing. The fact that he had married Feng Sheng this time was the most painful thing for Yunqing. She had privately expressed to others that she would never marry for the rest of her life. Her deep affection was the most touching. If he told her at this time that he wanted to divorce Feng Sheng, she would definitely agree. It would be better to use her to provoke Feng Sheng in front of Feng Sheng and get her to take the initiative to file for divorce. After the marriage contract was dissolved, he would then propose some conditions and discuss them with Qi Wan to see if she could accept them. If she could not accept them, he would then marry Yunqing. In this way, he would be worthy of Qi Wan and also worthy of Yunqing. However, although Feng Sheng was not clear-headed, she had not made any mistakes after marrying him. Once he abandoned her, his conscience would be very uneasy. He had to give her better conditions so that she could live a stable life in the future. Zhu Zhai was torn between reason and desire over this matter. He thought about it all night. The next day, he could not help but run to Zhang Yunqing's house. As soon as he entered the door, he sighed and sat on the sofa, just staring blankly. When Yunqing saw him like this, she thought that he had been bullied again outside. First, she sent a cup of tea over, sat next to him on the sofa, and very gently, in a low voice, asked: "Why are you unhappy again today?"</p>
<h3>Casual Notes from Liaozhai Studio</h3>
<p>— Hun Jia</p>
<p>One only has compassion when one has the possibility of falling into a pitiable state.</p>
<p>People should not judge each other, but only talk to each other—human souls have no one and no problem.</p>
<p>Grand songs or military music can indeed arouse our enthusiasm for generous dedication, but they can also arouse the same emotions in the enemy; the enemy's grand songs or military music can arouse the enemy's enthusiasm for generous dedication, but they can also arouse the same emotions in our hearts. Although the composer has a special purpose in mind when composing, the music itself is after all beyond national boundaries.</p>
<p>The way to relieve sorrow and boredom is better the less one has to rely on the cooperation of opponents, the more one can do as one pleases, and therefore the better. Mahjong is not as good as pai gow and playing cards, because pai gow and playing cards are not limited to four people. Playing any card game is not as good as playing an instrument or composing poetry or drinking wine. If entertainment still depends on external things, one will never be completely free.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jun and Zhang Jun</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>I mentioned Qin Hui and the Zhang Wang clan in this newspaper before, referring to Zhang Jun, but the character "Jun" was mistakenly printed as "Jun" (浚). This inadvertently caused Zhang Deyuan (浚), Duke Wei, loyal and dedicated to defending the nation, to suffer in place of Zhang Jun, who has been kneeling before the tomb of Yue Fei for so long. Therefore, I must say a word to clarify this.</p>
<p>According to historical records, although later generations of Song people highly revered Zhang Jun, even to the extreme (Zhu Xi wrote an inscription for Duke Wei's shrine stele, exceeding ten thousand words, and the "History of the Song Dynasty" even compared him to Zhuge Liang, stating that he resolutely opposed peace talks and his determination to avenge the country never wavered, living up to Zhuge Liang's saying of "dedicating his all until his dying day"), some later generations criticized him for his repeated defeats at Fuli and Fuping, resulting in countless losses. Some even blamed him for recommending Qin Hui, leading to a treacherous minister holding power, yielding to peace talks, and preventing the Southern Song Dynasty from ever recovering, tracing the beginning of the disaster to Duke Wei. Upon reviewing certain publications, I found that some people strongly defended Zhang Jun against these accusations, arguing that Duke Wei's integrity would not allow such actions, attributing it to a lack of historical knowledge. Zhang Jun swore to avenge the national enemy and refused to coexist with the Jin people, and he was undoubtedly a loyal minister of his time. Although his aspirations were not fulfilled, it is not right to immediately condemn him. However, to say that he never recommended Qin Hui is to ignore the clear historical records. The "Essential Records Since the Jianyan Era" states: "An edict ordered Qin Hui, the garrison commander of the temporary palace, to report to the imperial court. Zhang Jun believed that Hui had suggested establishing the Zhao clan during the Jingkang Incident, was not afraid of death, possessed ability, and could be entrusted with national affairs. At the time, many virtuous officials strongly recommended Hui, leading to his promotion." Additionally, the "Linquan Yelu" states: "When Hui was serving in Wenzhou, he was unremarkable and achieved nothing. When Zhang Jun became prime minister, the emperor visited Pingjiang to pacify the army. Jun believed that Hui was pliable and easily controlled, so he recommended him to fill a position in the imperial court, resulting in his appointment as the garrison commander of the temporary palace." The "Essential Records Since the Jianyan Era" states that Zhang Jun recommended Qin Hui because he "was not afraid of death, possessed ability, and could be entrusted with national affairs," while the "Linquan Yelu" states that Jun brought him into the government because he believed that Hui was "pliable and easily controlled." Although the two accounts differ, the fact remains that Jun recommended Qin Hui. However, the "Linquan Yelu"'s account is likely speculation, as Duke Wei would never have done such a thing. Moreover, when Qin Hui escaped from the Jin and returned, the court was shocked by his loyalty and righteousness, and many people recommended him, not just Zhang Jun alone. Even Zhao Ding, a virtuous man, regretted his decision to "work closely with him, only to realize his ignorance." The subsequent actions of Qin Hui were beyond anyone's expectations. Therefore, blaming Zhang Jun for harming the nation out of selfish motives is unfair, and Zhang Jun cannot accept such blame. If we were to judge people in such a roundabout way, then Cai Jing's governance, which led to the Jingkang disaster, could also be attributed to Wen Gong's selfish motives, as Cai Jing entered the government because Sima Guang admired his ability to implement the New Policies and introduced him. Furthermore, Zhang Jun's removal of Li Gang is often criticized, so Zhu Shengfei's "Xiushui Xianju Lu" extensively discussed their subsequent reconciliation and friendship, using harsh language to criticize Zhang Jun, which damaged his reputation. However, the "Essential Records Since the Jianyan Era" states: "Jun and Gang were initially incompatible, but later became friends, due to national affairs. Shengfei directly criticized them as an exchange of power, which is likely untrue." This is a fair assessment. In summary, Zhang Jun's merits and demerits balance each other out. Although he repeatedly suffered defeats and never won against the enemy, Wu Jie defended Sichuan, firmly resisting the Jin soldiers and not losing an inch of land. This was initially due to Zhang Jun's appointment and promotion of him. Ultimately, Western Shu relied on Jie for its defense, and Jun's contribution was significant. How can we solely blame Zhang Jun for the defeat at Fuping and ignore his contribution to defending Sichuan? As for his unwavering opposition to peace talks, the Song Dynasty depended on it for its safety. The country was weakening, and this one person was indispensable. The most that people can criticize him for is "great ambition but limited talent," which does not diminish Duke Wei's reputation. I have always believed that the Southern Song Dynasty was able to establish itself thanks to Zong Ze in the early stages and Zhang Jun later on. However, due to the similar appearance of the characters "Jun" (浚) and "Jun" (俊), they are often mistaken for the same person, which is Duke Wei's misfortune.</p>
<h3>The Harm of Skipping Breakfast</h3>
<p>— Tuo</p>
<p>In a Michigan arms factory, there were a continuous series of 1,000 fainting spells and various unfortunate incidents in 1945 alone. The majority of these fainting spells occurred between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM. These problems would occur for workers who had not eaten breakfast or had eaten very little.</p>
<p>During the morning hours, if one is constantly threatened by hunger, it can lead to nervous disorders, reduced judgment, and physical fatigue. The occurrence of these 1,000 unfortunate incidents was due to everyone skipping breakfast.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox</h3>
<p>To Qimei Junjian: There is currently no Esperanto organization in Shanghai after the war. At present, the only way is to study on your own. You can purchase the "Complete Esperanto Course" or "Introduction to Esperanto" published by Kaiming Bookstore as a self-study tool. When learning literature, if it is for appreciation purposes, the main method is to read more world classics and gradually improve your appreciation ability. If the purpose is to learn to write, in addition to the above method, you should practice writing more. If you can approach famous writers and ask them for guidance at any time, your progress will definitely be faster.</p>
<p>To Hanmosheng Junjian: The previous letter was forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for verification. The reply received stated: "After dispatching personnel to investigate, the situation was not as serious as described in the original letter. In addition to immediately ordering its removal and issuing a warning, the sanitation worker of the lane was also instructed to regularly maintain cleanliness. As for the fitness iron rings, the police department should be requested to handle them."</p>
