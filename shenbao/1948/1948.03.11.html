<p>〔本報瀋陽十日電〕東北通貨膨脹結果，流通券信用慘跌，其發行數可能達五萬億以上，然流通券增發中，發現一奇怪現象，即瀋長吉等地籌碼奇缺，致有使用本票者，各行局掌握之現鈔，與所需支出之數字相差甚鉅，流通券何處去了，已成一謎。據熟悉金融者談，約有三途徑：（一）匪以之套購物資，輾轉需時。（二）匪偷運關內使用。致東北商匯開放後，平津流通券俱充斥。（三）部份毀於砲火。此一問題殊堪重視，因流通券幣値遭受破壞，及物資流往匪區，均為東北經濟大漏洞</p>

<h3>若不積極援助中國三次大戰恐難免陳納德在衆院作證時稱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十日廣播：華盛頓訊，陳納德將軍今日出席衆院外交委員會作證，力言對華軍事援助可有助於阻止「蘇聯在歐洲方面之侵略」；反之，苟不以此種援助給予中國，世界將走上第三次世界大戰之路，而係無可避免者。陳氏宣讀之聲明，長達十三頁，其中指出，中國之龐大人口苟能予以適當之訓練，配備及供應，對軍事行動幾可提供無限制之人力。此項人力不為蘇聯所利用，對於美國具有最大之意義。鑒於中國在軍略上地位之重要，故在中國尙未赤化之前，，蘇聯不敢貿然在歐洲發動攻勢，此點不難想像。換言之，在中國仍為我國之盟邦與友人之時，第三次世界大戰大致不致發生。陳氏證詞之要點如下：（一）世界和平刻正受共產黨領袖在世界各地推行擴張政策而遭遇威脅；（二）堅强獨立與反共之中國國民政府，為吾人在亞洲阻止共產主義並維護世界和平之唯一希望，由於中國在地理上所處之重要軍略地位，在防止共產主義之全盤計劃必須佔有重要地位，苟中國成為共產國家，則亞洲大陸將全部共產化，而使吾人在亞洲無立錐之地；（三）中國經十年以上之戰亂後，所有資源已消耗殆盡，苟欲使反共之國民政府繼續存在，必須予以切實之軍事·經濟及財政援助；（四）此時美國如不能以適當援助給予中國，則將造成我國外交政策史上最大之失敗，而使第三次世界大戰無法倖免。</p>

<h3>農貸決先行開放工貸將採分案個別辦理全經會今討論外銷物資增產計劃</h3>

<p>公布所得稅稽征法政院並未變更法律</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕董顯光局長十日答復記者詢問二起，（一）政院最近公布卅七年度營利事業所得稅稽征辦法，是根據法規制定的一一種稽征手續，屬於行政命令範圍，並沒有變更稅法，依昭國府組織法國務會議是政府最高權力機關，有權發布緊急措施的行政命令，而在動員戡亂時期，為防止拖延納稅並收縮通貨，此項措施，實有必要。（二）量出為入，是國家財政的理財原則，本年國家歲入歲出的預算和所得稅的稅收預算增加的倍數，都在廿倍上下，現在拿六倍估繳，不過是是先繳一部份稅款，而且各地卅六年物價比較卅五年平均增加了十五倍左右，縱然利潤的高低不完全跟物價比例升降，但各業所得的貨幣數量，必然跟隨通貨數量或物價比例增减，所以六倍　標準，無論就那方面談，僅是應繳稅款的一部份，將來查賬結果，除營業確有虧損者外，都是要補稅的。如果查明確有虧損，應予退稅者，政府並付給利息，英美都實行隨得隨繼的辦法（Pay　as　you　earn），在所得稅今年所課的稅，乃是上年的所得，實在說來，六倍估織，等於分期繳稅的辦法，並不是預征，這對於工商界毋甯是有利的。</p>

<h3>蘆田內閣的前途</h3>
<p>日本片山內閣於二月十日總辭職。國會選舉蘆田均為首相後，蘆田即進行聯立內閣的組織。經過半個月來的波瀾重重，蘆田終於渡過風險，巳於本月九日組成了民主，社會，協同三黨內閣。在政策上，三黨政策協定巳成立，今後蘆田內閣的施政綱領，有了準繩。在人事上，民主黨在新閣佔六席，外相由蘆田首相兼任；社會黨在新閣佔八席，西尾末廣以國務大臣兼副首相地位；協同黨僅佔二席，作為聯合政府的點綴而已。看蘆田內閣組成代表的性格，和牠的政策決定，我們對蘆田內閣之前途，可作如下的觀測。</p>
<p>關於蘆田內閣性格的批評，不妨與片山內閣作一比較論述。片山內閣以社會黨黨魁為首相，以衆議院第一黨議席為支撑，其內閣政策則以實行社會主義相號召，但結果僅以八個月又十天的壽命而終。其中原因，固由於社會黨內部左右的分裂，和吉田保守新黨運動的威脅，與夫片山哲的猶豫彷徨，以致內悶不得不倒；但其失敗的主要因素，乃因社會黨閣僚把內閣生命看得比黨的政策更重要，二者難於兩全，不得不走上幻滅的道路。片山內閣為了愛惜政權的生命，事事要向與然特別是民主黨讓步，沒有一件足使日本勤勞大衆擁護的政策出現，甚至像煤礦國家管理法案原是社會主義者最强調的政策，結果也因民主黨的壓迫而成為一非驢非馬的具文，毫無社會主義的氣息。英國工黨組閣後，在內政上第一件大事，即為實行煤礦國有。工黨閣員和議員均不畏艱難，不懼挫敗，英國工黨終獲成功之道，並奠立了今天穩定的政治募礎。但在片山內閣，因為試驗社會主義失敗，失却了勤勢大衆的支持，其政策，其成績，同於幣原和吉田輩純粹保守內閣，所以牠必然遭遇失敗。現在蘆田內閣成立，以其組閣十八日行徑看來，蘆田內閣的性格究全與片山內閣相同，同樣把內閣生命看得比黨的生命更為重要，將來之歸於失敗，似乎也已是命中注定的了。</p>
<p>蘆田內閣奉為圭臬的三黨政策協定，完全以社會黨的主張為中心。社會黨左派要求的農地改革，勞動組合法的修改，戰時公債利息的停付，財產稅的開辦等，蘆田均或多或少接受了。蘆田本為比較保守，走中間偏右的人物，他所倡導的修正資本主義，又無堅實的理論基礎，其所以結好左派，容納左派主張，純粹茲於官僚政治的利祿觀念。至於將來行不行，或如何行，他是不問的。所以我們說，蘆田內閣的三黨政策協定，在條款上比片山內閣的四黨政策協定進步，但其結果恐將較片山內閣為更保守，更右傾，更不能兌現。以言蘆田內閣的人事，社會黨佔有閣僚八席，民主黨僅佔六席，說明社會黨在這新閣內的地位，是佔有絕對的優勢，擁有操縱和否決的權力，毫無疑義的，蘆田未來的作為，勢必事事遷就社會黨，尤其要向社會黨左派讓步。這次左派在內閣佔有兩席，加藤勘十任勞動省，野溝勝任國務大臣（不管部），是很難與該黨右派和民主黨合作的。內閣因摩擦而破裂，恐怕是很難避免的事。</p>
<p>誠然，蘆田內閣的出現，主要由於取得社會黨左右有派的諒解，特別是左派强力的支持，否則牠在國會中便要受到自由黨，全農派，同志俱樂部等反對黨派所壓制。蘆田為什麽　容計左　？一如上面所說，他由於利祿權位的驅使，而其目的　非欲藉此作為「民主」化的妝飾，直接欺蒙日本勤勞大衆，問接造成內閣的「安定」。所以在他心目之中，根本沒有接受其主張的動機。不過，蘆田均有一件「遠大」的報復，我們必須要指出：他意圖於日本和會召開時，爭取有利的形勢，造成日本「戰敗的勝利」。他並且意圖在反蘇的口號之下，利用美蘇的矛盾，爭取美國更大的物資援助，藉以復活日本的軍國主義。這便是他為政的抱負！本報二月廿四日社評，曾指出蘆田的粉墨登塲，滿懷壯志，必然的將日本政治倒退一步，反動一步。蘆田的政治基礎，是一個舊形態的日本，他可能悍然橫決的將軍國主義復活起來。這是我們所引為隱憂的。　至於蘆田內閣的弱點，在其政策和人事的不健全，因此牠的生命，殆將較片山內閣更為短促。蘆田本人雖有「冰冷幹才」之稱，但看這次組閣的能勢，是很難克服民主黨與社會黨的矛盾，和社會黨左右派對立所加予內閣的災害。現在民主黨名譽總裁齋籐隆夫已脫黨，太陽會已揭起反左派的旗幟，蘆田的遠同志而親與黨的作風，說明他對政權的熟中，甚至可以不需要羣衆和同志作支撑。這種官僚主義的作風，不受時代的揚棄，除非世界已完全奔向逆流。因此，我們預測蘆田內閣的生命和蘆田個人的政治生命，殆將為日本政治史上很短促的一頁。我們以為，這是日本的不辛。至蘆田將來失敗之後，可能是較蘆田更為保守更為頑固的人物出現，這更將造成日本的不幸。總之，日本的政治是益向後轉，二年多來的政治演變，眞有一代不如一代之感。</p>

<h3>距捷共黨政變纔兩星期馬薩里克躍樓自殺開國元勳哲嗣爲民言犧牲</h3>
<p>〔衆社普拉格十日電〕捷克外長馬薩里克家屬十日稱，馬氏自邱寗宮官邸躍樓自殺身亡，其自殺在共黨政變發生後十四日。按馬氏為捷克國父首任總統湯麥斯馬薩里克之子，今年六十一歲。其家屬稱，上月廿五日政潮發生後，渠始終神情頹喪。馬氏宣佈願繼續供職後，即拒絕與老友及西方各國記者見面。星期日晚，渠出席紀念其父之九十九歲壽之官方宴會後，獨自赴老馬薩里克之墓畔徘徊，十日乃以自殺聞矣。按政變後跳窗自殺者，馬氏為第二人，前司法部長竇迭那亦曾企圖跳窗自殺，致顱骨破裂。</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格十日電〕捷總理公署官報有云：「外長馬薩利克由於患有疾病及失眠症之結果，業於十日自行結束其獻身於國家之生命，渠之決定自盡，殆係發生於神經失常之片刻。」一小時後復發表公報謂「馬薩利克慘死前之一日或昨日晚間，渠並未有任何精神反常之現象。」</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格十日電〕戈德華總理於宣布馬薩利克躍樓自殺後之一小時，復發表吿捷克人民書，有云：捷克斯拉夫之人民，此非沮喪之時，一偉大人物雖巳別我而去，然不可以爲我國之局勢，將因渠之去世而轉劣。盼民衆保持鎭定，執業如恒，集會遊行除表示哀悼者外，一概非所允許。我自由之敵恐將利用此一機會，以促起動亂，當局對之將斷然處置。</p>
<p>〔路邊社普拉格十日電〕今日午刻前片刻，普拉格幾與外界完全隔絕。對外電話概不呌接，於官方發表公報後始恢復。</p>
<p>〔又電〕捷京迄至目前為止，尙無公衆遊行，街頭惟見三兩人羣竊竊耳語，悲切之情溢於容表。政府已令全國下半旗，私人民房並有自動懸黑旗誌哀者，一般民情雖表驚愕，然均持謹愼態度。</p>
<h3>全世界大爲震驚馬氏保持中和勢力無法施展捷共擢奪政權偽裝完全揭破</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕杜魯門總統之新聞秘書羅斯於獲知捷克外長死訊後發表談話如下：「總統甫自電話獲知馬薩利克自殺之訊，總統願意於今夜發表正式聲明以前，聲明渠相信此一偉人之自殺，並非由於神經失常或失眠症，實係由於該國過去兩星期來政治大變動之故。」馬歇爾國務卿表示，渠所獲知之代表性意見，乃為馬薩利克係被迫而接受外長之職，「當余獲知馬薩利克定在被民主國譴責之政權中接受職位後，甚感驚詫，渠之自殺可證共黨所控制之政府，非手創捷克共和國者之子所能容忍。」</p>
<p>成功湖聞悉馬薩利克之死，表示震驚。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕此間外交界人士相信，馬薩利克之自殺，已揭穿捷共黨所控制政府之偽裝。渠於政變之後繼續在政府中供職，被支持新政府之自由思想份子引為最近政變並為違憲之證明。自國外輿論觀點而論，馬氏之參加捷克新政府，重要更在貝奈斯總統之上蓋渠乃捷克共和國創造者老馬薩利克之子，不啻為捷克共和國傳統民主精神之象徵。渠之躍樓自盡，已證明渠之繼續祖任外長，並發表關於政變之公開談話，實係迫於脅迫不得不然。若干人士復謂馬氏之不曾立即退出內閣，原冀得在新政府中保持若干中和勢力，然自政府改組以後，復繼之以整肅運動及種種摧殘自由之措施，顯見中和勢力已無法施展，遂不得不出於自殺之一途矣。此間民主人士僉認馬氏之死不啻已對廿一天前之捷克政變提出最後抗議。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕法外部發言人於獲知捷外長自殺訊後表示，法政府對於此一偉大人物之於此時逝世，深表遺憾，可證共黨之控制捷克全國已對民主宣吿死刑。</p>
<h3>捷新政府肅清異已</h3>
<p>貝奈斯弟辭國會議員美領署一僱員被拘捕</p>
<p>〔合衆社普拉哈九日電〕美國駐捷大使館宣布，布拉鐵斯拉維亞美國領事署中捷古籍翻譯員斯比羅，於八日晚被捷當局拘捕，以「陰謀叛國」罪受訊。華盛頓美官員稱，捷克共黨控制之政府企圖製造「間碟陰謀」之證據，且擬牽涉美外交人員，斯比　之被捕，恐係計劃之第一步。某官員稱，捷新政府繼續鞏固其權力，肅淸反對派領袖，修改捷克法律，且徵集新黨員以强化共黨。</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格九日電〕貝奈斯總統之弟伏喬貝納斯，已辭去捷克國會社民黨議員之職。又悉，「斯洛伐克民主黨」經該黨行動委會決議將臣名為「斯洛伐克更生黨」，該黨前主席李特里樞及國會議員數人均被開除黨籍。</p>
<h3>馬薩里克略歷</h3>
<p>楊（名）馬薩利克（姓），年六十一歲，為手創捷克共和國故首任捷克大總統湯麥斯（名）馬薩利克（姓）之子。渠於上週政變後，在共黨控制之新政府中繼續担任外長之職，頗使西方觀察家感覺驚奇。馬薩利克為人和　可親，篤信西方民主，與英美外交官員友誼甚隆·渠於一九四〇年以來即任捷克外長，先在倫敦流亡政府，解放後返國繼續任外長職，乃一無黨派人士。渠出生維也納，先後在普拉格及紐約等地求學。一九三八年時原任捷駐英公使，迨至慕尼黑協定簽訂，乃於是年冬辭職。渠於捷克共和國成立後，即入外交界服務，至一九三八年辭去駐英公使職時，已在捷克駐倫敦公使館供職十六年之久。先任參事，後又於一九二五年調任公使，以迄一九三八年。一九三九年曾赴美講學，迨返抵倫敦，捷克巳為納粹所併呑，乃洗亡國外，參加捷克國民委會·一九四一年貝奈斯領導之捷克流亡臨時政府被盟國承認，渠乃被任爲外長·一九四五年代表捷克出席首次聯合國會議。馬氏幼年家貧，一九〇七年在一鐵廠中為小工，其後復在戲院担任鋼琴師，最後復成克雷恩鋼鐵廠董事·夫人弗蘭西斯克雷恩，乃一九二四年美國駐中國北京公使之女。（路透社）</p>
<h3>保捷將訂互助條約</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格九日電〕此間外交界預料，保加利亞與捷克即將簽訂互助條約，其內容奧保匈羅間之互助公約相似。</p>
<p>〔路透社索菲亞九日電〕保國會主席團今日下令開除甫於週末辭職之前保國駐英公使杜拉浦契夫及駐比公使郁魯柯夫之保國國籍，並沒收其全部財產。</p>
<h3>西歐聯盟條約草案五國完全獲協議下星期內即可正式簽字</h3>

<p>蘭氏循記者之請復詳為說明稱，關係國外長將於本月十六日在巴黎集商馬歇爾方案，五國外長當乘該一機會簽訂西歐聯盟公約。簽字以後，其他國家若義大利伊比里安半島諸國及斯坎的那維亞諸國，將被邀研究參加公約之可能性。以上諸步程序均可望於本月底以前完成。渠並曰，吾人之加緊進行，實係時間不容片刻浪費故也。</p>
<h3>英法建議防禦合作</h3>
<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾九日電〕英國所提之新建議，擬使西歡聯盟公約內之互助規定擴大至於各參加國之海外屬領，今夜曾由荷比盧三國予以考慮。英國之建議傳已經法國同意，其目標在幽結五國成為一堅固之組織，具有一常備的中央咨詢機構，並使各參加國之海外屬領，與西歐聯盟結成一體。據可靠方面息，英國對西歐聯盟草約所提關於各種問題之修正案，今日已經荷比盧代表接受，然荷比盧對於英國所提關於海外屬領部份之建議，認為與荷比盧草案內互助僅以本土為限之規定相距過遠，故尙不願遽即接受。比代表蘭根霍夫今日並否認美國一通訊社所傳五國曾請美國給予軍事保證之說。</p>
<h3>美國會加緊討論馬歇爾方案</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕參院共和黨領袖惠利，於參衆兩院領袖於今日開會討論對歐援助問題後宣稱，參院於本週內將延長開會時間，以討論歐洲復興方案，週四週五將於一夜間舉行會議，週六亦將繼續辯論。參衆兩院領袖會議係參院外委會主席范登堡及衆院外委會主席伊登所召開，所討論者殆為衆院應否暫停討論援助中國希臘土耳其之計劃，以加緊對馬歇爾方案之討論。</p>

<p>〔路透社東京十日電〕日皇於今日在宮中舉行蘆田均內閣之認證式後，蘆田首相即發表宣言，聲明渠及渠之政府將盡力忠實履行波茨坦協定。渠云：國家民主化乃日本精神再造及復興之先決條件，日本人民已永遠棄絕　武，今已在戰爭的破壞局面中重建民主門面。世界目光現集中於日本，新日本已在建立之中，日本為信仰民主之國，値得世界之信任，本人為新日本之首相，當盡力履行波茨坦協定，並將領導政府趨向此一目標。</p>

<h3>德境蘇佔區共黨成立新政府以與西德政府頡頏</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十日電〕此間蘇聯官方ADN通訊社稱，在德東區高級共黨九日之秘密會議中，成立一蘇聯支持下蘇佔領之新德國政府，定名為經濟委員會。共黨會議中一致推選老黨員里達為委員長及其他四名副委員長。　〔路透社柏林九日電〕德境英軍區長官羅勃森在此吿記者，倫敦三强會議所討論之最重要事項，或許即為馬歇爾方案。德輿論對於歐洲復興方案亦均相當重視。有云，德國境內第四佔領區不能受歐洲復興方案之利益，然此一第四區之不參加，並非永久性者，余仍盼望整個德國能獲得此一偉大計劃之利益。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕討論馬歇爾方案之國際工會大會，今晨在運輸大廈揭幕，參加者美國及西歐各主要工會共廿六單位之代表四十八人。美國兩大工會即產業職工大會及美國勞工協會，均派代表出席，葡萄牙土希冰島以及法國與義大利之全國總工會均無代表參加。大會主席英工聯大會理事長漢柯克女士向大會致辭，力言國際工會運動之分裂，不應阻止可以同意者之參加歐洲復興工作。　義全國總工會之非共產系代表巴斯托聲明義大利人民並未不贊成歐洲復興方案，義工人莫不企求馬歇爾方案下之援助，渠並認歐洲復興方案須與各國工會充分合作，而每一國家必須充分利用援助，以提高工會生活水準。此次開會情形將嚴守秘密，各代表赴開會處之英工會總部時，均盡力規避記者，在開會處之一層樓內不許任何生人入內。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦分治問題美勸告阿猶和解美蘇政策漸趨向不協調</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖九日電〕美蘇在聯合國中對巴勒斯坦問題之協調，九日似已終止。蘇聯某高級官員吿訪員稱，美國對實行聯合國之聖地分治計劃，正「猶豫不一決」。渠稱，美官員似意欲重啓聖地問題而再從頭開始。美代表奧斯汀在正式文告中答覆稱，蘇一官員「不及等候最近强國討論之終止而即臆斷此事」。美蘇不協調為各方面之發展之高潮，幕後形勢亦趨緊張。聯合國秘書處認為安理會有權以國際軍力支持分治計劃而遭美國之抗議，美蘇分手之程度不能立即斷定，但若千觀察家認為奧斯汀之文吿乃數月來之協調已近尾聲之信號。聯合國秘書處之立塲，至少一部份已獲蘇聯之擁護。其他主要發展如下：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯某高級人士稱，蘇聯將堅持聯合國之聖地分洽計劃必須實行，而其他國家（諒係中·美·法）似對此計劃之實行猶豫不決。（二）美國發言人稱，美國正勸吿阿拉伯高級委會放棄抵制聯合國而參加進行中之强國談判。美國亦要求阿聯盟七國勸說阿拉伯委會與五强中任何一國或安理會談判。（三）某大國方面稱，已有某種「談話」，擬建議展延分治及成立聯合國託管之日期。（四）大國緊急會談九日重開，英官員亦出席參加，然被等僅允提供消息，而不願參加執行分治計劃。</p>

<h3>「探險家」帶「病」返美測探積石山行期展緩　雷諾宣布在滬造筆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷諾積石山探險隊所乘之專機「探險家」號，在本市龍華機塲滯留多日後，昨日下午三時四十五分，終吿起飛。惟目的地已非南京，而係美國之洛杉磯，致中美積石山之測繪探險工作，亦將因此而延緩二星期。雷諾氏昨為此事，特於下午五時，舉行記者招待會，有所說明。據稱：「探險家」號專機，在離美前曾經嚴密檢査，機件均完整無恙，惟飛抵威克島過夜後，曾發覺汕缸漏油，即經修補竣事。抵滬後正擬飛京，油缸又發現新隙罅兩處，雖經加工趕修，汕缸機能仍未能恢復正常，每小時之漏汕量，約述半加侖，故不得不將機飛返洛杉磯，重加澈底整修。顧測繪探險工作籌備迄今，耗費頗鉅，即以飛機返美航程而言，一次所需，即達美金二萬五千元。惟「探險家」號旣有漏油病徵，飛行途中，，或有爆炸之危險性。茲駕駛員奧登，隨身携帶一應防衛器材，願意冒險駕機一行。山國空軍中尉朱潮亦願隨機飛美，俾多獲飛行經騐，精神殊堪嘉佩。專機此去修理，大致須於二週後，始能返華。本人擬與楊帝澤少校等，於十一日晨另行乘機飛京，與留京各科學家，共商測繪探險工作之進行計劃，或將共同先至闌州，進行準備工作。</p>

<h3>肥料與炸藥　永利化工公司錏廠內部透視</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日訊〕第一次歐戰後，協約國加壓力於德國所作的第一件事，便是使德國公布利用空氣中的　製合成　的方法。（　即阿摩尼亞，舊稱　，民國二十一年十一月敎部公布化學命名原則後改用　字，永利錏廠，亦應稱銨廠，故本文除將廠名照舊稱錏廠外，概用銨字。）因為合成氨在平時化工業是製造銨鹽及硝酸鹽肥料的重要東西，但是製　的設備，在必要時却可毫不費力的變成戰爭工業，製造成猛力的炸藥·這次大戰以前日本的肥料工業高度發展，待到侵略戰爭發動，所有的肥料工業都强制改成了製造硫酸，硝酸等軍事化工原料的工業。</p>
<p>兩使命一肩獨挑</p>
<p>據侯德榜先生（永利的總經理，中國有國際地位的化工界權威）自日本回國後說：</p>
<p>「日本肥料工業產量已恢復到年產九十萬噸的地步，距離戰前最高峯一百二十萬噸巳相差無幾，並且盟總還決定了肥料工業絕對不作賠償，同時核準高過兩百萬噸的年產量，聰明的日本化學工業家正把各類軍火工業都改頭換面，加以保留，奠定了侵略勢力的再起基礎。」（參閱「海王」第二十年第六期）</p>
<p>在日本的肥料和炸藥化工業於麥克阿瑟的卵翼下倖存之際，我們該想想我們自己，永利化工公司錏廠的工作是不可忽視的。中國廣漠的農田需要肥料，漫長的國防綫更需要炸藥，這艱鉅的供應使命在目前似乎都在永利肩上。</p>
<p>卸甲甸水路方便</p>
<p>離開南京十幾公里隔江的下遊，有一個良好的深灣，是可停泊兩萬五千噸輪船的內港，呌卸甲甸，不但水路方便，它離津浦路終點浦口更是近在咫尺，中國化工業的領路者故范旭東先生着眼在交通，治安種種條件上，在此地闢創了永利的第二大事業——錏廠。</p>
<p>錏廠原佔地一千五百畝，現在已擴充到兩千多畝。雖然在民國廿六年二月五日才開工出貨半年，因戰事迫近南京而陷於停頓，負責人員拆卸了被炸後殘留機器上的表規和控制機件，隨政府西遷，在淪陷期間，又被日寇不愛惜的糟塌了六年之久，永利當局的努力使他們不曾辜負勝利的賜予機會。復工一年多後的今天，看看錏廠排除萬難　寳貴成就，使人驚喜在中國竟還有蒸蒸日上的工業，更使人憤恨那多的是盲目浪費與瘋在破壞。</p>
<p>硫酸銨製造程序</p>
<p>硫酸銨的製造，有六個重要的程序，廠里的技師長（總工程師）謝為杰先生，（他是女作家冰心的胞弟，留美學化工，在永利巳有十九年歷史）領着我們一邊參觀，一邊講解。</p>
<p>第一部份是煤氣廠，空氣，水蒸汽與焦炭製出氫和氮還有二氧化碳與一氧化碳，在這里製出的氣體呌作粗氣，導入</p>
<p>第二部份氧化部以後，把不穩定的一氧化碳大部變成二氧化碳，一齊送到</p>
<p>第三部份精煉部，把二氧化碳和少量一氧化碳用水冲去，把純粹的氧氮二氣送到</p>
<p>第四部份高壓部，通過高壓復藉能媒作用，維持相當溫度之下，便直接化合成液體氨，輸送到存儲器中隨時備用</p>
<p>第五部份硫酸部，用接能法從硫化鐵礦製出純硫酸輸送到</p>
<p>第六部份硫酸銨部，氨與硫酸在道里中和成潔白勻凈的結晶硫酸銨，烘乾，包裝，便是上好的肥料。</p>
<p>原料上焦炭迫需</p>
<p>生產的原料，在目前以焦炭最成問題，煤氣廠耙錄簿上用炭種類，包括江西萍鄉，四川天府，徐州中興，還有台灣以至加拿大，澳洲產的。製硫酸用的硫化鐵是由資委會馬鞍山礦供給，來源旣近，無虞缺少。再有，便是動力問題，直到如今還是仰賴着首都電廠，去年十月十九日起，為了過江電纜的損壞，停工三月以上。</p>
<p>生產量逐月增加</p>
<p>錏廠的產量，據謝技師長說，二月間的平均每日產量是：合成液體銨二九·五噸，硫酸一〇三噸，硫酸銨一一四·五噸。但工人指出各部門的每日產量則是：合成液體銨四〇餘噸，硫酸一三〇餘噸，硫酸銨一四〇餘噸。記者在第六部份硫酸銨部紀錄簿上看到的硫酸銨產量，三月五日是一四二·三噸。不論如何，錏廠的生產量在增長着。謝技師長很感激聯總對永利的帮助。在永利錏廠復員之初，聯總派兩位專家到卸甲甸來詳細調査，決定除了帮助恢復以前規模外，並設法使設備增加，使產量提高為戰前三倍，日產四百五十噸。聯總供給的機器，約値一百萬美金，由永利分六年以硫酸銨償付農林部。</p>
<p>兩年半擴展計劃</p>
<p>我們看到廠房附近正在打新的地基，江邊上的起重機正往岸上吊木料磚瓦，鐵工廠里正加工翻砂上在作各式的鐵架和龐大的鍋爐，研究室和設計部里多少冷靜的頭腦在工作。謝技師長說：「兩年半以後，我們的擴建計劃可以全部完成。每日產量可能達到四百八十噸。」　不過，就按五百噸一天計算吧，年產量還不到二十萬噸，而台灣一年所需就要三十萬噸，還有華中華南呢？謝技師長說，永利希望能把產量擴展三十倍甚至五十倍。</p>
<p>侯德榜十年若功</p>
<p>永利化工公司是范旭東先生一手創辦的，但范先生不幸逝世後，竟一無遺產，范夫人在上海是借住着朋友的房子。繼承范先生遺業的侯德榜先生和所有永利的工作人員，也都沒有發財。侯先生窮十年之功，研究出製鹼方法，打擊索爾維集團的壟斷謀利，名震世界，印度和巴西先後都請他去帮助改良製鹼工業，但所得的外匯報酬，從不曾下過他自己的腰包，都為永利添購了設備。永利的職工都甘心情願的接受廠方所給的相當優渥的報酬，勤懇的生活着，工作着。</p>
<p>只是在工人方面近來却多多少少感覺着廠方的福利工作作的不够，雖然他們最低的月薪已從戰前的十五元漲到二十元以上，但物價的高漲使他們也不免受到些生活的壓迫。他們曾不止一次在南京的報紙上呼籲請求社會的同情，並且在今年元月廿六日，已由江蘇省社會處批准了組織成立產業工會，要為本身爭取福利。但是，他們也還是　膺着事業第一的信條，也要繼續范先生的遺志　同謀產業　發展。</p>
<p>爲職工努力設想</p>
<p>廠方對工會的看法很客觀，認為這個組織正當的成立，可使廠方正確的對工人福利知所需要，有所改進，更可使工作效率藉此更為增强。廠方稱認工人宿舍不够住，工人待遇不够高，更承認生產現况綽有盈餘，但也指出在擴展計劃加緊實施中，盈餘並不是為了賺錢，而工人人數衆多，建築材料不易買，也是困難所在。不過，無論如何，廠方總在儘力為職工着想。永利沒有鬧過罷工之類的把戲，是最有力的明證。</p>
<p>裝電網鞏固據點</p>
<p>錏廠四週築有高牆，上面還裝了電網，保安武力也相當强，在前些日子，六合一度驚擾時，卸甲甸工廠仍安然無虞，而今工會的組織更把工人從精神上聯繫起來。這個民族工業的據點，將堅强無比。被日本人刦走的硝酸設備，不久就可以從大坂裝船運回來，那時除了富國的肥料以外，永利還會供給強國的炸藥。但我們還禁不住希望，錏廠的TNT產品最好還是用在YVA的建設上。（本報記者濮德玠）</p>

<p>〔鎭江訊〕第七屆全國運動會決於五月五日在滬舉行，各省市運動會亦均在積極籌備中。記者特走訪蘇省有關各機關，據關係方面人士云：以本省省立體育塲在淪陷時期，為敵人澈底破壞，幾成廢墟，故修理塲地，為期固久，需款亦鉅，經精密之統計，單修理塲地及添置設備，即約需款二十餘億元，再舉行全省運動會費用，約七億元左右，連同省代表出席全國運動會，約一百五十人，需十餘億元，共計約四十億元弱。蘇省情形特殊，蘇北幾全為匪區，省庫拮据，視情形可能無法參加，惟敎育當局現正盡量設法中，或者可局部參加云。</p>

<h3>審價委員會即可成立　進行收購出口物資　輸管會四單位代表已分別指定</h3>
<p>推廣出口物資，輸管會曾擬定計劃，由全經會討論後轉政院核示，現巳進入實行階級。一切收購事宜，由財·經·農三部，四聯總處，中央銀行，中信局，輸管會等七機關，各派代表一人，會同組織收購出口物資審價委員會，負責辦理，由輸管會主持。召集會議，則由中信局與輸管會共同負責。四聯總處，中央銀行，中信局，輸管會四單位代表已指定，四聯總處為四聯分處副主任刁民仁，中央銀行為業務局副局長邵曾華，中信局為副局長何墨林，輸管會為輸出推廣處處長陳雋人，一俟財·經·農三部代表派定後，即正式成立，開始收購。收購價格，均由審議會決定。中信局祗負執行收購，收款，付款等責任。審計部以國庫支付關係，審核支付賬目，會議時祇派代表列席。</p>
<p>據輸管會負責人談：今後為加强輸出起見，收購及外匯調整兩項辦法，決同時並行。外匯匯率在某一時期某種環境之情形下不能促進出口物資出口時，即採收購辦法，以保持國外價格，及國內價格原則。收購價格，當以國內外市塲情形而定。出口物資出口商如能自行出口，決不强迫收購，如不能自行出口，則申請政府收購，且收購以後，仍委託出口商代為經銷，並給予合理之手續費。出口之日得到國外信用狀以後，可向中信局結匯，中信局即照當日牌價給付國幣，可見此種措施，並非統購統銷，全為扶持出口商，推廣出口着想，出口商之資金，不致如過去之凍結，當可獲得充分資余之運用，此項辦法，政府曾經實行有效，國內外價格，確能保持。　即以桐油而論，戰時初期，美桐油價格每磅為三角角八九，勝利以後，跌至二角，美桐油農有謂我實行傾銷所致，我為挽救出口危機，特實行收購，美價即由二角回升至二角四五二五，我收購以後之輸出價格，當時定為二角五，美價格不能售至此數，決不出口，此價曾穩定相當時期，繼我停止收購，美價跌至二角一二，美油農復要求政府增收進口稅，將提價至三角。我為適應國內外需要，乃定為二角四分又八分之一，今後仍當以國外情形為轉移。</p>
<p>關於外匯之調整，輸管會負責人亦有解釋。據稱：外匯牌價與黑市，早已脫節，外匯牌價係根據出口物資價格而定，出口物資價格與國外價格之百分比有超過時，外匯牌價即照百分比予以調整。此次外匯調整後，桐油已能出口，即以每磅二角四計算，約計每担値三百二十元美金，以十九萬五千外匯牌價折合，則為六百萬，目前市價不過六百萬元。</p>
<h3>食米麺粉選挺後降　油市人心振奮均見上展</h3>
<p>昨日米市，先挺後降，晨開承上日後市之漲風，及其他物價猛烈奔騰之影響，各檔米價即挺升甚鉅。白粳早市三百八十五萬，薄稻三百八十萬元，蕪秈做三百四十二萬，均高於上日二十五萬左右。惟中途因銀根緊倘，執主需現求售，且戶口米之發售，本街去路本呆，是以走銷益為呆滯，後市乃告回降。白粳退為三百七十五萬，薄稻亦三百七十五萬，較上日升十五萬。北市塲白粳三百七十五萬，及薄稻等約升五萬至十萬元。昨日到貨，一一市塲合計八千五百〇四石。</p>
<p>麺粉　早市因米價激烈向升，貨主趁機扳悄，兵船粉為一百四十八萬元，老車粉為一百四十九萬元，紅蜂·建成·等，又較上日升四五萬元。惟銀根轉緊，執貨者不得不吐售以求現，一時供應充沛，市乃因供多而下降。加以米價漲後轉跌，人心更為不振。兵船收市一百四十七萬，老車一百四十八萬，均為送到價。麩皮因廠方開出多，故呈疲軟。</p>
<p>雜糧　隨本市為轉移，黃豆早開升十萬，中途靑島帮納取，漢口車豆市勢較俏，漢口乍豆最高至一百八十五萬，惟客胃不續，收市仍回至一百八萬元，終高於上日五萬至十萬元。生仁廣帮亦略納，稍挺十萬餘元。</p>
<p>食油　初升後稍回，初開時由於米價之激升，人心亦為之振奮，况無錫價格高昂，故執主心思甚堅。豆油晨開衝出七百萬外，大有及大統豆油七百〇五萬，收市因銀根緊，及米價小，故轉為懈淡。豆餅先出八十萬外，收市僅較上日升萬元</p>
<h3>八種公債還本抽籤</h3>
<p>民國二十年統一公債乙種債票等八種公債還本抽籤，十日晨在滬假中行大樓公開舉行，財政部公債司司長陳炳章，幷親自由京來滬主持。</p>
<p>抽籤結果計：（一）民國二十五年統一公債乙種債票第二十五次還本，計中籤債票為八百四十萬元。（二）民國十七年金融長期公債，第二十九次還本，計中籤債票為國幣一百一十二萬五千元。（三）民國二十五年整理廣東金融公債第二十三次還本，計中籤債票為國幣一百二十萬元。（四）民國二十五年四川善後公債第二十四次還本，計中籤債票為國幣六十萬元。（五）民國二十六年闢濬廣東省港河工程美金公債第二十二次還本，計中籤債票為美金八萬元。（六）民國二十八年建設公債第一期債票，第十四次還本，計中籤債票國幣三百萬元。（七）民國二十八年軍需公債第二期債票，第十三次還本，計中籤債票為三百萬元。（八）民國三十年軍需公債第三期債票第九次還本，計中籤債票為國幣二百萬元。</p>
<h3>統債步升　外股堅俏</h3>
<p>公債昨步升之局，形勢尙平，成交亦僅三百萬。統丙晨開一〇萬九，自一〇萬元升至一一萬元收市，五五五宗買進，五五二室進後略出，五〇〇室五〇三室則出，較前收計甲乙升五千元，丙漲八千元，丁戊各好七千元。　外股昨重又掀動大買風，不少股戶，在惶惶然然境况下，爭相搜羅，混亂而奇俏。港電縮得慘厲，以致高後難回，橡皮股騰躍如故。怡紗晨開後即穿出一六〇萬太關，迫近一七〇萬關而後稍盤，籌碼有限，不敷需要。紙版等更有利多刺激，以致漲得十分有力。較前收計紙版藥廣怡啤航業鋼業電話電車及橡皮股均昂二成以上，餘股亦升一成强。</p>
<h3>人絲繼續高昻　廠經綢貨疲軟</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市繼續高昂，上午尙稱堅穩，一二〇號旭字有光，開盤在二一億〇二百萬左右，最小曾降至一億儿子九百萬元，午收又回升至二億〇三百萬元。下午由五百萬元做起，最後昂至二千萬元賣出價，較上日行情又大起二千五百萬元。　廠經昨市始呈疲軟，下午復告上揚，D字等級上午成交價為二億六千萬元？高零担五千五百萬元亦有幾担做開，下午喊價頓吿昂升，且乏供應。D字等級喊價高至八千五百萬元左右，高零担喊八千萬元。干經高零担喊價為二億四千萬元之譜。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市疲落，因上日晚原料低回，人心不免虛軟，故華强眞絲被面開市即降至九千萬元，最小八千八百萬元有一張成交，後又高升至九千五百萬元，旋再降至三百萬元左右盤旋。收市即期做九千三百廿萬元，隔日期為四百萬元，下午場外喊價又叫近一億元。大誠格子壁縐，收市做二十九萬元，其他各貨，廠盤並無上落。</p>
<h3>華股新買興奮　高價層出不窮</h3>
<p>華股昨呈遍地錦綉，游資湧來，港電慘縮，新買興奮，有十四種漲達限度，熟股多現新紀錄。賠償物資之配給，股戶集中於閘北及美亞，兩股更見俏利。</p>
<p>晨初人心因華北游資湧來而見穩，開出即秀。永紗以一三〇〇元及一三一〇元之價登場，信誼且吿漲停。七六號等來進遞交，一六〇號等咸買即交，中法商務漲達限度。永紗升至一三三八元及一三四七元。九五號等逢高了結即交，一〇二號等了結遞交，退至一三二〇元及一三二八元，惟因證交理事開會，外間有大加改革之傳，洋股大俏，人心易好難回，中興漲停。六〇號等力購即交，三六號等進遞交亦切，永紗漲到一三五二元及一三七〇元高價。一八五號等脫手，一七一號等力售即交，回小至一三三〇元及一三四〇元。中法商務亦回，雜股及次熱泰半回跌，永紗尙有二〇二號等吸即交，二三一號維持遞交，午收為一三三三元及一三四五元。較前收即交股中興信誼漲停，商務中法漲停後有回，軋升一成强。中紡閘北火柴華新各漲一成，內衣國貨小挫，餘均微升及半成不等。遞交股信和漲半成，餘均小升。　後市祗做即交，港電慘縮，人心興奮。永紗自一三八〇元起，經二三二號等進至一四二五元新高峯，信誼，中絲，中紡，中法，火柴，永業，恒豐，中興，閘北，搪瓷，華新，商務，均站漲停，中泥統益漲停後有同。後聞港電有回，逢高經一八五號等連袂脫手，回低至二一三九〇元，一一六號七一號維持，收市為一四一五元，美亞亦由一八三號等爭購，終吿漲停板。較晨收即交股除閘北美亞中紡大通商務中絲華豐火柴中法信誼恒豐中興漲停板，統益中泥升一成，永紗信和新光永公麗安景福景綸勤興內衣新華國貨升半成，餘均小升。塲外各未上市股票俱見漲起半成左右</p>
<h3>增加保證金　決呈部備案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交昨舉行第卅五次常務理事會，甫要決議案三起：（一）經紀人保證金增至二億元一案，業已遵照辦理，並決定呈部備案。（二）遞交存帳額，自六十億元增至二百億元。（三）改善交易辦法，原則通過，並決定在市塲中央，設置鉅額交易櫃。</p>
<h3>金融管理局　抽查行莊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海金融管理局，在舊曆年關到最近物價劇烈波動期間，又發動了一次大規模的檢査，抽査的行莊，有二三十家，抽査的要點，據探悉。（一）關於各行莊頭寸情形，（二）關於退票情形，（三）關於票據抵用情形，（四）關於倉庫情形，（五）放款催收情形。</p>
<p>現檢査已全部審核完畢，結果受檢行莊業務尙屬正常。但有少數行莊，或因放款過多，不能如期收回，回致頭寸　計失當，或因透支過額，牴用過　，以致發生退票情事。茲金融局已嚴令各行莊，分別糾正。據悉：各行莊奉令後，已一一遵照辦理云。</p>
<h3>外路游資流入市場　棉紗布一再挺升</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開人心猶在看好，津粵等帮續有搜吸，本街廠商亦有跟進。細紗因市上籌碼枯涸，本客兩帮吸納頗勁。四十二支藍鳳紗續漲六百萬元，再創一億六千八百萬元高價收市，全日趨勢，二十一支現　馬中途雖有檯面帮拉抬，曾創九千六百萬新高峰，嗣因銀根仍緊，浮多獲利吐售，卒以九千三百萬收盤。棧單為九千一百萬，軋降二百萬。十六支粗紗，以複製廠商仍有進吸，續挺二三百萬。二十支紗及卅二支等粗細紗，互有一百至三百萬之升降。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開因美援空氣似有加强之訊，人心平定，一般浮多了結甚夥，市盤一度壓低。旋聞北路游資，擁集滬市，流入棉布市塲活動，漢粵津及山西帮等競進殊烈，同業間亦有巨額收吸，又加散戶亦來哄抬，買風展開，價遂續向高峯上跳。迨至最後，十二磅龍頭等各細布，比上日再創新高價，步升十五六七萬元，其餘嗶嘰直貢及漂布色布士林布府綢等，亦均上揚，自十二萬至三四十萬元不一，市氣至為堅挺。</p>
<p>又訊：邇來棉布瘋狂在上漲之因素，全係外路游資作祟，惟査本街去化平庸，布號家進出亦不甚熱鬧，客地實銷依然呆鈍，市有倒懸之虞。染廠亦以銷胃有限，吸納頗微，嗣後如冉冉上升不已，市民有難以蔽體之憂。</p>
<h3>紗管要求各廠　提棉紗三萬件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會為把握棉紗，平抑棉紗市價計，近曾請各廠提出棉紗三萬件，並擬於本月底先提半數，其餘半數，於四月十五日提取，價格照本月底及四月十五兩日紡建公司報價結算。該案已正由六區棉紡公會洽商辦理中。</p>

<h3>工業油脂堅秀</h3>
<p>工業油脂市面，以燭皂廠商實需奇殷，如牛油及柏油等收吸最勁，行情遂吿堅秀，蚌埠及本莊牛油到存二少，每擔均漲一千二百五十元，柏油禾本每擔亦上升至一千萬元，其餘蘭油尖麻拆雪等價，亦挺升至九百三·五十萬元，較前挺升一二成左右。</p>
<p>煤斤陸續運抵滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局消息：該局民三〇二號拖輪，前日自漢拖來三三二及十二兩鐵駁，共運來煤斤一千〇二十噸，又華字二一一號登陸艇，拖帶六號及四六一號兩鐵　，共計裝來煤斤七百二十餘噸。</p>
<p>海列輪自秦皇島運來煤一千噸，海桂輪自南京運來一千九百五十七噸，昨日到滬。又海杭輪自津裝煤一千一百噸，日內即可抵埠。</p>
<p>捲煙再升</p>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，以美匯掛高後，原料成本高增，廠盤勢必再度調整，派貨恐將延期，因此人心看好，買風加强。各烟續吿騰踊。最後十支大英老刀兩烟，較上日繼漲四百萬及四百五十萬元，其餘中外各烟，一致步升自一萬至三四萬元。五十支茄力克昂至四十二萬五千元，三五牌卅六萬，軋高六萬七千及五萬二千之鉅。</p>
<p>肥皂狂漲</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，初開平穩，後受菸市上升影響，人心復俏，大戶進取被暢，同業抵補亦殷，並受　而帮等聯袂收吸塲內一片喊　聲中，市又飛黃騰達。結果固本箭刀兩皂再度狂漲廿八萬及卅一萬元。此外祥茂光華美麗等，亦均上升二三十萬元不一，</p>
<p>火柴交易亦暢，美麗牌每箱昂至二千八百萬元，上升三百五十萬元，其他雜牌亦高七八十萬元</p>
<p>火油飛揚</p>
<p>火油市掛，因美匯况價提高，同業批發市盤一致調整，本客辦胃甚强，貨底不充，市勢挺俏。高度桶油上揚至一千七百萬元方肯賣出，美孚聽油亦昂至一百七十萬元，較前軋升二成有餘。</p>
<h3>十期臺糖配價提高　最高上升一百十五萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕臺糖公司因最近台幣匯率又有變更，要求調整配糖價格。經昨日食糖評議會議定新價，自第十期配糖起實行：糖類（單配售價（批發價（位市担）單位萬元）單位千元）</p>
<p>特號砂白　三七〇　四六〇八</p>
<p>一號砂白　三五五　四四二八</p>
<p>二號砂白　三四〇　四二四八</p>
<p>三號砂白　三一〇　三八八八</p>
<p>赤砂　三二五　四〇六八</p>
<p>台靑糖　二九五　三七〇八</p>

<p>冰糖　五一〇　六二八八</p>
<p>又訊：昨臺糖配價已大加調整，最高升一百十五萬元，最小升八十五萬元，打破歷來調整價格之最高紀錄，故糖價不絕上升，原非無因。</p>

<h3>社會文化之動態</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>Social　and　Cultural　Dynamic</p>
<p>P．A．Sorokin，American　Book　Co．Vol．I-III1937　Vol．IV　1941</p>
<p>我常常在奇怪，無論甚麼事情，何以到了我們中國人手裏就做不好了.甚麽好的制度，好的計劃，好的材料都會逐漸的變質，而且會變得不堪設想的壞。　前這一片的政治腐敗，經濟貧乏，社會墮落，敎育破產……到底它們的原因在那裏？有人歸罪於某些人的貪汚無能，有人歸罪於某些人的興兵作亂，但是我認為都並不是這一回事。照我的看法，中國日前的這一片混亂乃是東西兩股文化交流所產生的必然的現象。西諺云「舊瓶裝新酒」，我以為中國現在的情形乃是「新瓶裘裝舊酒」。別看很漂亮的三星白蘭地的瓶子，裏面却是陳年紹興花雕。因此，在政治，經濟，社會，敎育各方面，無論是組織機構，人事管理，方案計劃，無一不是從西方文化中搬運過來的。但是我們的生活習慣，處世態度，人倚世故，却又無一逃得出中國文化傳統的範圍。所以我以為中國的問題應在東西文化的交流過程中求解決。</p>
<p>蘇羅鏗（Slrlkin）便是一位尋求西方文化出路的學者。他的著作很可作為我們硏究東西文化交流的參考。以前我在本週刊曾經介紹過他的一本「今日之危機」，很為一般人所重視。他的著作尙有「現代社會學說」（黃文山譯商務版），「社會變動論」（鍾兆麟譯世界版）。作者學識的淵博實足驚人，他所引用的文獻有蘇聯的，法國的，德國的，義大利的，至於英美的更不必說了。本文所要研究的一本書包括四大冊：</p>
<p>第一冊論文藝形態之變遷共七七〇頁</p>
<p>第二冊論哲學，倫理，與法律之變遷共七二七頁</p>
<p>第三冊　論社會關係，戰爭，與革命之變遷　共六三六頁</p>
<p>第四冊論社會動態之基本問題，原理與方法共八〇四頁</p>
<p>作者說他的社會思想原是受二十世紀早期的思潮所影響的，他相信社會進步，相信革命，相信社會主義和民主主義，相信科學的實證主義。他說：「無論好壞，我曾為這些價値而奮鬥；因而也曾付了相當的代價。我希望和平的進步而不要戰爭；我希望不流血的社會改革而不要流血的革命；我希望更高尙的人本主義而不要集體的自殺；我希望更好的民主主義而不要寡頭的獨裁政治；我希望科學的改進而不要虛偽的宣傳；我希望人類多方面的改善而不要重陷於野蠻的境地。但是第一次的世界大戰給與予這種概念第一個無情的打擊。蘇聯革命是第二個大擊。祗要有人在一九一三年把現在接迎所發生的事情的極小一部分作一肯定的預測，他在當時將立即被視為一個在人。但是許多許多似乎絕對不可能的事情却在繼續不斷的發生。」</p>
<p>這是甚麽道理？由於甚麽原因？作者便開始徬徨，繼而搜索材料，尋求根源。最後在世界文化的潮流中他找到了一個綫索？本書便是他歷年來探求的結晶。第一個問題他所要解決的就是「文化之流到底是迴復循環的，還是層創無窮的？」他的答案是說：第一，文化的動態力是一種有創造性的迴復式。歷史文化的過程並非永遠成直綫形的進展而時時有新奇的變化。可是在這些變化中郤仍有舊成分的重演，不過它們是比較成功許多小單位而重覆的。第二，他認為各種文化的發展過程是有一種極限的，這就是說，某種文化有一個時期向某一方向而沒有甚麼顯著的變化，可是當它達到了它的極限時它馬上就會向下游而走向另一個新的方向。（他稱為「極限的原則」，見第四冊第十四章）。第三，這種變化的原因並不一定是由於外來的原因，而是因為它的內在力量已經到了一個非起變化不可的階段。（他稱為「內在因的原則」，見四冊第十二章）。</p>
<p>他認為各種文化總不外乎迴復於（甲）理念的（Indeational），（乙）理想的（Iniealistic），（丙）感覺的的（Senate）三種形態之間。在理念的文化形態中人們超越經驗，追求精神價値，厲行自制。在感覺的文化形態中人們放縱情慾，尋求物質享受。理想的文化形態在兩者之間取其中道，情與理兼而有之。他指出印度敎，佛敎，道敎，是屬於理念型的文化；伊璧鳩魯，愷撒，列寗及現代西方文化是屬於感覺型的；孔子的中庸之道是屬於理想型的。</p>
<p>作者的硏究法是邏輯涵意法與因果功能法並用的，也就是說，歸納與演繹合用的。他說：「純粹搜羅事實而無思想則無從獲得有音義義的結論；純粹邏輯推理而無事實，則必有空虛不實之感」。前面所申述的這個理論一方面是作者根據事實所擬的一個假設，另一方面他又從許多的文化歷史中證實了這個假設。所以這個學說並非向壁虛構而有其事實根據的。</p>
<p>於是作者在本書第一冊中把西方的繪畫，雕刻，音樂，建築，文學從原始時代，經過希臘，羅馬，中古，以及文藝復興，一直到現代，他作了一個有系統的全盤硏究，把各時代的作品都用數日字統計起來，藉以看出它們發展的趨勢。第二冊分兩部分：第一部分是硏究各時代的各種知識糸統的發展，這就是所謂「知識社會學」。他追溯唯心論與唯物論的演變；永存論與暫時論的演變；唯實論與唯名論的演變，決定論與不定論的演變；一切物理生物等等科學理論的演變，以及因果，時空，數目等範疇的演變。他把歷年各個學派向消長都用詳細的數目字來說明的。第二部分是硏究各時代的倫理和法律的變遷。其中他也找到了同樣的路綫。它們都不外乎在感覺型，理念型和理想型幾種文化中或波浪式的迴復。第三冊分四部分：（一）社會關係的型態與變遷，其中包括各種政治的，經濟的，宗敎的，社會的團體組織；（三）各團體間戰爭史的變遷；（三）各個團體組織中內部的擾動和崩潰；（四）人格型態與社會型態之間的關係。</p>
<p>根據他研究西方文化各方面發展的結果，他以為西方文化在中古時是理念型的階段，而現代走上了感覺型的階段。目前却是感覺型文化發展到近乎衰落的時期了。作者對於西方文化在最近將來的發展趨勢得有下而的幾點結論：</p>
<p>（三）物質的價値將更加是相對而零散的。以後，眞偽，是非，美醜，正負都混淆不分了。無論在心理上，道德上，社會上，美感上都成了無政府狀態。</p>
<p>（三）一切工作都在進步，川是破壞的進步，而不是建設的進步。無論人類，或一切的價値都被視為理化作用，反射作用，經濟作用或機械作用。這個宇宙祇是一個原子和電子的世界。</p>
<p>（三）所謂公意，良心均將消逝。一切都是意見紛紜。</p>
<p>（四）武力和欺詐成了爭取一切的手段。結果，普遍的祗見戰爭，革命，反叛，擾亂。人與人爭，國與國爭。</p>
<p>（五）自由成了壓迫者的口頭禪</p>
<p>（六）政府日趨腐化，欺騙，暴虐，以槍彈代麵包；以死亡代自由；以暴力代法律；以　壞代建設。</p>
<p>（七）家庭已不再是　婦間神聖的結合而成功了一個男女會合的逆旅。離婚將逐漸增加。</p>
<p>（八）生力與創造力將繼續低落，已不再見牛頓，達爾文，貝多芬而見一些平庸的思想家，影片製造家，音樂掮客。</p>
<p>（九）生命安全將受威脅，自殺，精神病，罪犯增加。大家都感覺到苦悶。</p>
<p>（十一）一般的人們將分兩派：一派是「今朝有酒今朝醉」的樂天派；一派是　苦修行，不求功名的隱士派。</p>
<p>將來的趨勢是勢覺型的文化衰老逝去，而理想型或理念型的文化將產生一股新的生力，發揮新的創造力，而形成一種新的精神文化。</p>
<p>中國現在的混亂程度似乎是無以復加了。中國正在巨大的變化之中。這是一個蛻變。一切腐敗的，頑同的，强暴的，瘋在的成子均將蛻落，新的生命，新的型態的文化帶着他的新的創造力即將來臨。</p>
<h3>生活藝術</h3>
<p>— 朱方</p>
<p>曹孚著　開明青年叢書</p>
<p>俄國盲目詩人愛羅先珂說：「我們在春天所播種的，我們在收成的時候就可以收穫。全年的幸運都倚靠我們的春天的工作，飢荒缺乏以及一國的別的一切不幸的根也都長在春天裏。」靑年眞似人生中的春天，所以我們也　　　靑年時期播下良好的種子。</p>
<p>而且，靑年是最容易感到苦悶，煩惱，悲哀的。要救治這種問題，及播種良好的種子；這就是靑年的修養。</p>
<p>生活藝術一書，是討論許多靑年修養的問題，它値得我們注意的有二點：第一，它不重靑年的外表琢磨。第二，它指示靑年的都是大方向，並不頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚的。</p>
<p>本書共有十一篇文章，第一篇「一個理想主義者的自供」是著者介紹自己的人生哲學。第二篇「人生與興趣」中，著者提出三個條件指示靑年：（一）持久性——他引梁任公的話：「凡一件事做下去不會生出和趣味相及的結果的，這件事便可以為趣味的主體。」</p>
<p>（二）周遍性——他說：一種興趣，如其排拒其他同樣好，或者更好的興趣者，就是不好的興趣。反過來，一種興趣，能誘發其他同樣好的，或者更好的興趣者，就是好的興趣。（三）合理性———他以為興趣中必須有思考，有理想。有些趣味；如賭博喝酒是經不起思考的，所以不能為興趣，最多也不過低級興趣。第三篇是「計劃生活」他引了宋理學家張載所說的四句話作為最高級生活計劃之最好說明：「為天地立心，為生民請命，為往聖繼絕學，為萬世開太平。」也就是說最高級的生活計劃是將個人計劃同歷史的使命，時代的要求配合起來</p>
<p>接着四篇是「工作」，「遊戲」「讀書」，「戀愛」。也許就是靑年最關心的四個問題吧。最後一一一篇是「反犬儒主義」，「英雄與英雄崇拜」，「羣與己」，此外還有序文二篇，對靑年的修養，亦有裨益。尤其是靑年要修養些什麼一篇。</p>
<p>總之，這是一本健全的靑年修養的書。</p>
<h3>英語語原常識</h3>
<p>— 文尼</p>
<p>劉君霨著　中華書局出版</p>
<p>硏究語言最無趣，它不比其他科學較生動，較有實際性。原因是文字是死的，僅能代表一種語誓的符號而已無怪它無趣了。</p>
<p>學習英語每為讀者所苦，中外異殊固一事，最大原因還在單字，而單字又極抽象，很難記憶。英國單字說有十萬餘，雖不必盡記，亦為苦事了。往往就使學者半送而廢。其實英語的單字除自己本身的　爾特語外，還混有拉丁，希臘等語系，所以極其複雜；再加上語首，和語尾的衍化，愈使共繁複了。要硏究英語明瞭它的語原是很必需的，誠如該書緖言中云，「……，根據　　，即可知其　　，分　總合，一目瞭然，以此類彼，舉一反三，旣可牢記已知，復可推及未知，……」，又在序中云：「字原之功用，則不特詳舉一字之來源及其與他字連綴而生之變化，又進而解其構造與字體之　進……」</p>
<p>我國關於外國語原之書籍還屬少見，該書分述四個部份：</p>
<p>（一）單語構成概要：把單語的種類和構造作一很簡括的陳述，並隨舉以例。</p>
<p>（二）接頭語之結合現象。</p>
<p>（三）接尾語之結合現象。</p>
<p>（四）語根槃，以上三部份把每一個語頭，語尾，語根作簡單之解釋，並附以充分的例子，以示它的效用，而所附的例子也很常見，很實用，雖然只不過一百五十餘頁的小冊子對於硏究英文者是一本很好的參考書，就是在寒假中作為消閒讀物也很相宜，願為介紹以供同好。</p>
<h3>談「凱旋門」</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>著者　雷馬克　譯者　朱雯　出版　文化生活出版社</p>
<p>十一月的巴黎黑夜，賽納河旁，阿爾瑪橋畔的長街上，一個德國的亡命者，遇見一個斷腸的女人，「凱旋門」的故事就這樣開始了：</p>
<p>雷維克，像無數反納粹的流亡難民一樣，沒有眞名實姓，沒有護照和身份證，好像一切都是「非法」；他是巴黎某大名醫的「後台醫生」，一個施行手術的「捉刀人」，當然，這樣的職業是秘密的；他住在「墓穴」似的旅館裏，沒有所謂「家」，一個獨身者的寂寥，在巴黎，自然極易排遣，女人，隨便愛一個，隨便丟一個，原是無所謂的。雷維克就這樣無所謂的打發日子，在異國的流亡生活中，他的喜悅和悲哀，歡樂和牢斷，哭和笑……原也無所謂的；但是——瓊恩·曼陀，那個阿爾瑪橋畔萍水相逢的陌生女人，那個女人，恒河沙數人類中的一個人，她的臉，無量數臉中的一張臉，她的眼，千萬雙眼睛中的</p>
<p>一雙眼……並不一見如故。可是雷維克幾次的要忘記，幾次的忘不了；這可愛而又可惡的吉布賽型的女人，他對她並不一見傾心，然而她闖進他的生活裘，甚至是闖進他的生命裏來了，雷維克私心不願承認，郤又無法否認。</p>
<p>沒有身份證，就沒有一切；然而他現在有了瓊恩·曼陀：他為她的男人料理喪葬，他為她找到一個夜總會裏　歌的職業，他帮了她不少的忙；瓊恩所需要於他的郤還不止此，她要一份整潔的小小的公寓，整潔的小小的苟安，屬於兩口兒的溫暖；…但是，他不能够，他沒有租賃公寓的理由，也不能够和他愛上的女人結婚，因為他沒有身份證。因此他們只能短時的離開巴黎，到安底卑斯去玩一些日子，安底卑斯的碧色的海灣，和太陽的金黃，點綴得日子更美了，這短短的幾天，充滿了光和愛，可惜這些快樂都是沒有根的，雲端裏的幸福，雲端裏的好夢，回到巴黎，夢也醒了。</p>
<p>後來德國佔領了捷克，巴黎的火藥味兒該更濃了？但是巴黎還是那樣的巴黎，腐敗和繁華，什麼都照舊，都和他走的時候一樣，只有一件事不同了：——瓊恩·曼陀離開了夜總會，和一個電影演員同居。只有這一件事和從前不同，一件極細小的事，然而這是多麼的不同啊。</p>
<p>像每一雙失和的戀人一樣，他們之間，經過多少解釋，原諒，責問，容忍……愛了又吵，吵了又愛，壞了又好，好了又壞，最後是藉斷絲連。那是千古以來最難折斷的絲，愛。</p>
<p>許多難民在找別的去路，許多朋友都離開巴黎，因為戰戰事旦夕就要發生了，但是雷維克不作他計；現在，他已經復了仇，他所恨的人已經死在他自個兒的手裏，他為什麼還不離開呢？現在，連笙歌迷爛的巴黎也這樣的緊張起來了，雷維克，一個獨身的德國難民，他有什麼戀戀不捨的呢？</p>
<p>有那樣的一晚，雷維克接到瓊恩打來的電話，她懇求他趕快去，她需要他，但是雷維克將電話掛上了。接着，一個不相識的年靑男人走進他的門，就是那個電影演員，和瓊恩同居的，這個人帶來一個不幸而可怕的消息：瓊恩受傷了，開槍的就是他自個兒，為了情妬。</p>
<p>雷維克望着自己的手，他的手，開過千百次刀，救過多少生命的手，但是現在變得無能為力了，他的手，殺死了最恨的人，竟無法救活最愛的人。——最愛的人，在那生命最後的俄頃，她吿訴他她愛他的，他也吿訴她他愛她的，然後瓊恩就那樣的死了，雖然她並不甘心死。</p>
<p>雷維克並不悲愁，許多的險，在他面前閃過，臉和往事，然後是那張最後的不動的險。陽光的金黃在游移，游移，這是他自由自在的最後幾小時，因為德法宣戰了。</p>
<p>卡車經過凱旋門，雷維克和一大羣人擠在裏面，他從這一個「墓穴」被送到另一個，更壞的「墓穴」——集中營，那時候，到處都沒有燈光，只是一片漆黑。……</p>
<p>故事就這樣的完了，完不了的這本書給人的一種憐憫，一種忿怒，一種恐怖，以及一種對自由和光明的渴想和期望；這種情緒，這種意念，為萬千個讀者心中所有，但是很少有人能够具體的說出來。這樣多的情感，這樣多的人生的滋味，這樣多的人生的經驗，這樣多的人生的痛苦和歡樂，這樣多的愛，熟烈的愛，愛到野蠻，這樣多的恨，深切的恨，恨到瘋狂；……這些火辣辣的痕跡，血和淚的現實，今世的詩材，不是那虛空縹緲無中生有的傳奇和戲劇；這是人的故事，而且還是時代的故事，世界的故事；這是人的悲歌，而且還是時代的悲歌，世界的悲歌；因為這裏面所描寫的不僅是人類的黑夜，並且也是時代的黑夜，世界的黑夜。我們讀了「凱旋門」以後，不但要為故事中的人物哭泣，並且要為這世界，這時代流下眼淚。</p>
<p>本書作者，似無需再作介紹，提起雷馬克，成千上萬的讀者立刻就敏感的想起「西綫無戰事」，那是第一次大戰後全世界公認的劃時代的傑作。一次大戰，雷馬克就帶給世界文壇一顆最輝煌的明珠，這部「凱旋門」，歐美批評界一致認為超過作者過去任何一部作品，並已由美國電影界攝製影片。</p>
<p>雷馬克在納粹秉政之後，就逃出德國，僑居美國，此書即在美國寫作，在美國出版，在美國翻譯，根據美國讀書會之紀錄，銷數已有兩千萬冊。除本書及「西綫無戰事」外，作者尙有“The　Road　Back”，“Flotsan”，及“Three　Comrades”及等著；文化生活出版社已計劃出版「雷馬克全集」，由本書譯者朱雯先生譯述，作者另一巨著「浮荷」（Flotam）現已譯成，不久即將付印云。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>泥土哲學</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>當初上帝創造人，據說用的原料是泥土，泥土取之大地，大地即人類的母親，而人的最後歸宿，也依舊要投到這位母親的懷中，仍舊化為泥土。再拿人的生活來講，迫本溯源，又那一樣能够離開大地的關係。記得某年筆者病在一家安息會辦的敎會醫院中時，曾看到一本講衛生健康的書。該書主張人應該多喫蔬菜之類，少喫魚肉暈腥，因為猪羊牛馬多半是靠喫草類生長的，人用草類飼養了猪羊再食共肉，旣不經濟，也不衛生。這個簡單的道理，我至今猶十分銘感，而益發感到上帝用泥土創造人的深意。即使這是神話，也頗有意思。</p>
<p>但也許有人認為泥土是不潔的東西，上帝用此造人，未免太媽虎了。例如紅樓夢中的賈寳玉，曾自嫌男人是爛泥做的，所以不潔，祗有女人才是淸水做的。賈寳王自然不知道上帝造人的故事，其實女人祗是男人身上分出的一部份骨肉，根本也是泥做的。泥土創造人的神話，據我看是另有深意的。</p>
<p>第一，人自大地來，最後仍歸大地去，是顯示着人的因果關係，呌人在俗世的人生中不要忘了本。且不說富貴名利猶如浮雲，就是在人生過程中的一切事業，得留步時也應該留一些餘步，為一己的生活，為後代的子孫，為我奇生所托的社會與國家，一個人自當盡其應盡的一份責任，但在自我與利他之間，仍應留下幾分餘地。</p>
<p>這種意見並不是虛無主義與出世主義，如果你能冷靜地觀察一下世像，你一定會對芸云衆生的忙碌情形感到喫驚，甚至嘆息。馬路上那些摩肩接踵的人羣，究竟急忙着些甚麼？是為的求生嗎？然而未必個個都是為的生活而忙碌，恐怕一半倒是無事忙。因為在不見半根靑草的柏油馬路上，說有甚麽眞實的生活意義，究竟難以令人置信。</p>
<p>生活的條件是不能離開食物生產的基本條件的。然而據專家統計，中國需要三億八千萬人的農業勞動始能供養其餘的七千萬人。反之，在生產發達的美國，則僅需三千二百萬人的農業勞力即可供養一億八千萬人的食物了。因此，照理說，眞正忙碌於生活的該是三億八千萬人的中國農村而非七千萬人的都市。可是實際的情形似乎相反，內地農村早都十室九空，深感人力不足，而在上海這樣的都市中，則是人力過剩，</p>
<p>都市人力過剩的結果，自然避免不了生存競爭，於是上焉者從事投機，下焉者從事黃牛，面大家都美其名曰求生。然而求的是甚麽生呢？祗是以種種變相欺詐的手段，設法把你袋裏的錢倒進他的袋中去而已，不僅毫無生產可言，實在是人力的大浪費。</p>
<p>不過問題還不止於此。那些大小黃牛居然還講究那一套所謂「事業精神」，不僅對於「銅鈿進出」的事絕不媽虎，就是對人對物，也滿是可怕的「競爭」精神，無論是搶軋電車，爭跑市塲，都巳到了有你無我的程度了。有一次我曾聽見一個電車上的賣票員向一個拼命爭軋上車的乘客說：「你不要不顧死活的硬軋，等一等沒有關係的，你能多活廿四小時就多的是時間。」然而現在許多人為了眼前的競爭，似乎早沒有餘暇去計及他未來的二十四小時了。</p>
<p>我並不是消沉，但七尺桐棺一杯黃土的日子終是人人挨得着的。人原不過這個世界上的過路客，能在這個世界上做一些造福人羣的事，自然値得人人一試，即使單為一己打算，也不能說是罪過。然而在人生的過程中，如果能經常帶幾分哲理的透視，則無論對己對人，縱使無益，也決不致有害。</p>
<p>此間所謂哲理云云，並無甚麼高深的道理，祗要你能有機會到郊外去握起一撮泥土把玩把玩，就盡在其中了。</p>
<h3>厭囂篇</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>幼時曾讀過一篇亨利·文·黛克的文章，題目呌做「靜」。他有一句警句是：在這個時代，聲音實在太多，我們簡直不能「聽見」我們自己的思考了。</p>
<p>文·黛克所指的「這個時代」是十九世紀的末葉，正是熈來攘往的承平之世，商業界尤其一帆順風，繁榮空前。廣吿術也開始大規模的被運用了，到處都是招貼，標語；於是習於寧靜的學者如文·黛克者，就感覺到他四一座無形的高墻已被這些新的「文明」衝破，發出了絕望中的呼籲。然而呼籲也是徒然的。人類的耳朶就是一樣最不受指揮的器官：我們可以對不願意看的事物閉上眼睛；但我們無法對不願意聽的聲音閉住耳朶。今昔相較，文·黛克還是幸把顧客們統統嚇走，讓自已的店福的，至少在他那時代，有一樣「文明」還沒有現在那樣的强大，普遍，强聒不舍。</p>
<p>這一樣「文明」，就是無綫電收音機。</p>
<p>幾年前，我在一座高樓上辦公，辦公室是沿馬路的，馬路對面恰好是一家新開的二三流百貨店。那家百貨店並無收音機，却在大門口裝了一隻擴音機，每天從早晨起就雷吼着他們僅有的三張唱片，一直到晚。有一個朋友曾問我：「為甚麽我每一次打電話給你，總是聽得見『將人頭懸掛高竿」呢？」我在苦笑之餘祗好告訴他，我們對門的那一位老板，把財神節當做天殺星了。</p>
<p>金少山的法門寺也許並不壞——雖然我相信他的「架子」決不如郝籌臣。但天天連總那麽多次，恐怕就是金少山自己都要呌饒罷？再說，以「將人頭懸掛高竿」作為招攬顧客的一種手段，也未免太幽默了！</p>
<p>這當然祗是一個極端的例子。但是，商店利用無綫電收音機來吸引觀衆之風，却至今未改。每走過一條馬路，除掉汽車喇叭的波波聲此起彼應之外，就是這一大片無休無歇的廣播戰——這一家是響澈雲香的京戲，緊隣一家就是尖銳無比　歌曲，對門也許又是悲悲切切的紹興戲。走在路上就已經頭痛如劈，試間就是想買東西也還敢走到那些喧囂的發祥之地——商店裏去嗎？</p>
<p>仔細一想，商店之必備綫電，而且必然開得如此之書，也許是夥友們一種貪懶妙法。他們門前為那些心臟特强的專門聽無綫電的人堵滿，豈不落得個淸閑無事？</p>
<p>我並不想批評無綫電節目的好壞，更決不願低佔無綫電的貢獻。譬如說，聽到去年杜壽義演時的廣播，就令我對無綫電感激涕零。（不過我至今還不懂何以那次義演竟沒有人灌唱片；難道沒有聽見過NBC的那幾套托斯卡尼尼唱片嗎？）我所要指出的祗是：人人興趣不同，假定我是一個從來不要聽越劇的人，而某商店偏是一天到晚專開越劇節目，那麽我自然就決不會走進這家商店。如果商店的目的本來是想招攬顧客，而我本來也確是準備，到這家商店去買東西的，竟因無綫電之故而交易不成，豈不甚為可惜—開收音機多少也要費一點電，我想，倒不如把這一點電省下來多裝點鮮艷奪目的霓虹燈罷——它至少還點綴了一些這個都市的夜景。</p>
<h3>小學教師</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>學校有大，中，小之分，所以，執敎鞭的名義也有敎授，敎員，敎師之別。唯其敎書是最淸苦的生涯，因此有人說：大學「敎愁」，中學「敎怨」，而小學「敎死」。姑不論其是否諷刺，而小學敎師之値得同情，總是不可否認的事。。</p>
<p>也許因為是我那位小學裘的啓蒙老師特別淸苦的關係，我終對他念念不忘，高而瘦的個十，數十年來混和在天眞的孩子堆裏，使他對於兒童的心理，有深切的了解，也帶來了漸白的頭髮和更淸苦的生活，和他闊別了十年，這戰爭顚連的十年，從我姊姊處得悉他仍在母校執敎，據姊姊說：張老師的人更瘦了，白髮蒼蒼，也許是他十年來的成績吧！他說在報上看到我學習着寫文章，感到很高興。由於他的注意使我不覺產生衷心的歉疚，因為這幾年來，我始終沒有抽空去拜望過他一次。</p>
<p>也因為如此，我更感到小學敎師們，除了沒有所謂物質的享受外，他們也得不到什麼精神上的慰藉，小學生畢了業，由中學而大學，對於小學時代的先生，平巳置之腦後，遺忘得一乾二淨了，然而我們的老師，他是多麼的難受呢？</p>
<p>在我心裏常這麽想着，每年總有許多同學畢業，他一定不會認識我了吧！但是，事實證示了我的理想錯誤：那是在我們的校長朱少屛先生馬尼刺殉難以後，我在報上寫了一篇短文紀念他，用的雖是一個筆名，然而在文字由他看出了他的學生，在某次的機緣裏，他詢問了我的姊姊和我的近况。顯然的，他並未忘却我們這批小孩子，正像一個慈祥的母親一樣，她正以注視的目光瞧着她所孕育的孩子！</p>
<p>像一棵老樹的根，茂盛的枝葉是由於老根養料的供給，才能蒼翠滿目；巍峨的大樓，任你多高，沒有地下根基的支特，怎能站立？</p>
<p>寫這篇短文向我小學時代的老師致意，並且祝福他的健康！</p>
<h3>自由</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>政治的自由，不能給我們自由，我們先得使自己的思想自由。—泰戈爾自由好似財產，假若你要它完成它的功用，你得當心的去施用它。——麥唐納</p>
<p>維持自由的生活，這是一件煩難的藝術。—傑佛遜自由這東西，你必須贈給別人，不然你自己也保不住—懷德</p>
<p>一個人若一旦喪失他的自由，他將再沒有別的東西供他喪失了。—瑞典諺語</p>
<h3>飛碟之跡</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>去年夏天，曾經鬧過很久高飛碟，世界各處都曾發現，報紙傳播，成為下游圍弓蛇影，疑鬼疑神的新聞。筆者有友在哈佛大學留學，最近以一封信來報吿這一眞相，原來飛碟並非什麼秘密武器，而祗這是麼一回事。原信摘錄如下：</p>
<p>××兄：在國內新聞紙久未寓目，渴思一讀之下，弟昨於碧嫂處獲讀數紙，雖明日黃花，而發現有述及「飛碟之謎，迄未揭開」者，此在此間，早已不成其為謎，蓋報紙雖未如何泣染，視為重要新聞，然已揭露一二，果眞國內尙未揭謎，弟願一述其詳，此蓋V2火箭所弄之玄虛而已。火箭自地上（新墨西哥州）發出時，以精確計算之自動機於天空一百哩左右爆發，而彈頭之鋼質碎片，遂向上飛，其速度為每小時二五〇〇〇英里，此種碎片於上飛中途，為地心引力吸向地球而作不規則之環繞飛行，有如落英繽紛，映日作光，圓形如碟，以迄於地心吸力之內向力曳使墮返地球而止。蓋其時遝動之外向力，漸弱地心吸力之內向力故也。</p>
<p>此種試驗之作用為測驗超大氣層中空氣之密度與溫度，藉以了解超大氣層中離子空氣層之眞相如何，並解決若干電彼問題，及實體拋向地心吸力之外問題，國人相驚伯有之問題，如是而已。實驗除吾校外，尙有加里福尼亞工科大學及賀普金斯大學等。（下略）</p>
<h3>漫話印象</h3>
<p>— 白楚</p>
<p>一般講起來，中國人是不大注重印象的。對一個陌生的朋友，我們就不敢隨意批評；一方面固然是怕話出了口，傳到別人耳朶裏有麻煩，但最大的原因，實在是「無從說起」。平常我們說某人好某人壞，那祇是表示到現在為止，根據累積的觀察，認為他如此而己—這裏面決沒有印象的作用，也沒有他永遠是好或壞的意思在內。社會上不是流行着「蓋棺論定」那句話嗎？這說明了我們非等到那位仁兄嗚呼哀哉後是不敢下斷語的。</p>
<p>為什麽我們不重視印象，為什麼非要到「蓋棺」才能「定論」呢？這就牽涉到面子的問題。中國人是愛好面子的，如果他要和你認識，即使是窮得欠了二房東三個月房錢，他還是剃頭沐浴，借一套洋裝，裝得像公子哥兒似的來見你；即使他是最卑鄙無恥的流氓壞蛋吧，也會裝得　斯文溫柔，咬文嚼字地與你胡謅上一陣子。如果就憑這些而留下好的印象，而認為他是公子君子，那豈非要鬧笑話！大家都懂得這個道理，於是心照不宣，誰也不會根據印象來批評人了。就因為印象失却效用，要下準確的判斷，非等到蓋棺不能再度的時候不可，否則你你剛說他是人，狐狸尾巴却已在後面搖起來，沒有照妖鏡，知道他是那一種東西變的？</p>
<p>然而同樣在外國，情形却大不相同，「first　impression」差不多是一個極普通的名詞，而且也非常看重。如果這「第一印象」是好的，那猶如在政府註冊一樣，你永遠成為好人，即使偶有錯處，也覺得情有可原，加以包涵。反之，假使你給他的第一印象相當惡劣，那以後一定會「另眼看待」，即使你表現得不錯，也認為是意料之外的「奇跡」了！</p>
<p>一個是蓋棺論定，一個是印象第一，這顯示了與洋人與洋人對人態度的不同。</p>

<p>火柴　王百里</p>
<p>火柴日本稱曰燐寸，我國則名洋火，亦名自來火，而溫州更有名自來火燭者，以細木條蘸取燐硫等易燃之物，藉化學作用，磨擦而生火也。十九世紀之初，奧人潑來歇爾Prdschel製紅紅頭火柴（非今日市上所售之紅頭者）；瑞典人倫特斯脫路姆Lundstrom製黑頭火柴，擦之無聲，即今日所謂安全火柴是也。按阮吾山茶餘客話載：京師人　草麻梗為小片，塗硫黃於其末，呼之曰取燈。杭州人有以松木為之者，曰發燭。按史載周建德六年，齊后妃貧者以發燭為業。又淸異錄云；「夜有疾，苦發燭之緩，批杉木染硫黃，遇火即燄，呼為引兒。」凡此，皆今日火柴之濫觴也。溫州人所謂「自來火燭」者，蓋亦「黃燭」之遺意乎？</p>

<h3>讀者信箱　戶口米·定價高　升斗小民迫切呼籲</h3>
<p>編輯先生：自古膊新春以來，物價波動，瘋狂直上，漫無止境，哀我小民，何以為生—尤以人民所一日不可缺之食米，今竟創四百萬元以上之驚人高價，如斯奇貴，貧寒之民，勢將盡成餓芋。無怪乎人心皇皇，國家前　尤悠可危。我當局有鑒及此，決定配售戶口米，以濟民困，誠為利民德政。然實行總嫌　緩，卒致造成米價之最高峯。當時若能迅速配售，諒不致如此上漲。然又孰知議定之配售價格，與市上白粳相差無幾，而事實上欲賴戶口米為生者，要皆　貧苦之人民，如此高價，則貧者將不堪設想。鄙人今為滬市平民請願，對於配售之戶口米，其價似不應超過黑市白粳之半數。因為二期戶口油配售價格，訂定售價，每市斤二萬四千元，而黑市油價固在每市斤七萬元左右。茍能如此，則黑市米價必可跟此下跌。今以二百四十萬元，為配售戶口米之議價，則市上米價永無下跌之可能。雖美其名謂戶口米，實則與民毫無裨益。又報載，民食調配當局表示，三月份配米價格，已定每石二百四十萬元，並無减低可能。如再减低，恐將發生倒流現象，反而不美云云。然則每次配售之戶口糖與油，其價均較黑市價格賤二倍餘，何未聞有倒流之現象。又謂，此次辦理配米，其目的在穩定米價，使周期性之漲風，得以延緩。但近日黑市米價空飛　進，並不因有配米而稍稍遏止，豈非因配售傳口米之議價過高之故。須知國以民為本，民以食為天，升疛小民不得不請求政府當局，迅予核减，以蘇民困而安社會。鄙人一介寒士，尙為國家社會着想，諒在朝袞袞諸公，亦必以民命為　。貴　服務社會，解譽播及全國，當必蒙特予披露，為民請命也。此請撰安　陸兆琪敬啓三月六日</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Disaster in Qingdao, Explosion of Military Ammunition Depot on Shanghe Road, Approximately 500 to 600 Civilian Deaths and Injuries</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 10th] Ding Zhipan, commander of the 11th Pacification Zone, and his deputy commander, Li Mi, express their sincere gratitude to Vice Admiral Badger for mobilizing all the U.S. Navy's medical personnel to rescue the disaster area of the Shanghe Road explosion, demonstrating righteousness, courage, and benevolence.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 9th] At 11:30 AM on the 9th, a military ammunition depot on Shanghe Road in this city suddenly exploded, the sound shaking heaven and earth and the whole city. Instantly, black smoke billowed into the sky, reaching a thousand feet high, followed by raging flames, and iron sheets and unprimed shells flew everywhere. The citizens of the city turned pale with fright, and order broke down for a time, enveloping the city in an atmosphere of terror. The disaster area reached one square kilometer, with unprecedentedly severe losses. Within a radius of 500 meters of the explosion center, including Shanghe Road, Guitai Road, Qingcheng Road, Dagan Railway Station, Taishan Road, and other locations, more than 2,000 residences were completely destroyed. Cement and copper-bone buildings had cracks in their rear walls due to the violent shaking, teetering and collapsing, and most of the roof tiles were blown away, and the windows and glass were shattered. Thousands of solid buildings have been turned into ruins and are catching fire and spreading. The Qingdao Port Authority's Dagan terminal office buildings and warehouses collapsed. Immediately after the incident, martial law was declared in the affected area. The U.S. Marine Corps was the first to mobilize to assist, with more than ten ambulances and 200 medical personnel arriving on the scene. The Shandong University-affiliated hospital dispatched an ambulance and more than a dozen nurses. More than twenty U.S. military and Qingdao fire trucks and a municipal hospital ambulance arrived to provide rescue, and a plane circled overhead to observe the situation. As of 7:00 PM, more than 100 corpses had been found, lying across the sidewalks of Shanghe Road, covered with quilts, a bloody and blurred sight, too horrible to look at. The total number of deaths and injuries is estimated to be 500 to 600. Rescue and firefighting work has not yet stopped, and the dead are still being excavated. There were also casualties among the U.S. Navy. Those with minor injuries were sent to the municipal hospital, and those with serious injuries were sent to Pier No. 2 for treatment on the U.S. Navy medical ship. There were dozens of people in total. The explosion site was originally stationed with two platoons of wounded soldiers from the 8th Army, a squad of guards, a company of transport troops, eight vehicles, as well as stored clothing and other supplies. The deaths, injuries, and losses are still under investigation. The Suiyuan Road Elementary School and refugee shelter nearby suffered heavy casualties. The city's hospitals were full, with wounded people covered in blood being carried, driven, and walking for treatment. It can be called an unprecedented disaster. After the incident, the reporter rushed to the scene to inspect. Along the way, residents facing this catastrophe were all standing on the streets, looking nervous and waiting for news. On the scene, all that was seen was smoke and flames, refugees were rushing to transport clothing and quilts, and broken bricks blocked the road, like the aftermath of a major bombing. Chinese military police were on hand to serve, extremely brave, and U.S. military police and Navy medical personnel were also actively engaged in the rescue. The authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the accident.</p>
<h3>Northeast Petition Delegation to Meet Foreign Minister Wang Today</h3>

<h3>Government Protests to Soviet Union Over Unauthorized Intrusion into Airspace and Attack on Civilian Aircraft, Foreign Minister Wang Meets with Soviet Chargé d'Affaires and Sends Note</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Foreign Minister Wang met with Fedlin, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, at 11:00 AM on the 10th and sent a government note protesting the illegal act of two Soviet fighter planes with red star markings intruding into our Bohai territorial airspace without permission and attacking and strafing the Chennault Air Transport Group aircraft. It is reported that this protest did not include a request for compensation, because the Soviet planes' actions did not cause any harm. The Soviet Embassy in China only stated that it would forward the note to Moscow and did not express any other opinions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Chennault stated that he believes that the two fighter planes with "Red Star" markings that shot at the Air Transport Group aircraft were Soviet planes based in Lushun. He also said that the Soviet Union has no reason to oppose my planes flying to and from Shenyang. We are flying on Chinese territory under the orders of the Chinese government, completely in accordance with international law. Chen also said: "I have ordered the Air Transport Group aircraft to continue flying to Shenyang to carry out the evacuation work. The number of people evacuated from Shenyang has reached 3,000, and this work will be completed soon."</p>
<h3>The Weekly War Situation Announced by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released the "Weekly War Situation" from the 3rd to the 9th of this month on the 10th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Siping City Under Combat</p>
<p>During this week, the bandit troops in the Northeast continued to move from western Liaoning to northern Liaoning. With the strength of two columns, they attacked the airport in Siping. On the 4th, it was once invaded by bandits, but was repelled by the National Army. The bandits then reinforced and counterattacked. At noon on the 6th, the National Army, because the airport had been destroyed by artillery fire, concentrated its forces to consolidate the suburban area of Siping. It is still under combat now.</p>
<p>The North China Battlefield Achieves Brilliant Results</p>
<p>Since the National Army launched a sweep in the North China battlefield, it has already achieved brilliant results. On the 4th, it defeated the four regiments of Liu Bingyan's bandit troops in the Jizhong Military Region who had infiltrated the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area. On the 5th, near Xianghe in eastern Hebei, it captured more than 70 bandits, including the district team leader and village cadres of the Third District, and seized a large number of weapons. It immediately recovered Baodi, Xianghe, and other places. On the 7th, it annihilated more than 600 bandits of the southern branch of the Tangshan outer perimeter and militiamen, and more than 300 bandits of the Fanjiadian who infiltrated near Qinhuangdao. At the moment, scattered bandits are quickly being cleared from both sides of the Guannei section of the Beining Railway, and the Pingjin Highway is also unblocked. Several columns of Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops are still hiding in the mountainous area of Yixian, Mancheng, Tangxian, Wanxian, and Dingxian on the west side of the Ping-Bao line.</p>
<p>Communist Bandits in Central China Scatter and Flee</p>
<p>The communist bandits in Central China have recently scattered and fled in separate groups. Chen Yi led four columns, 1, 6, 8, and 4, from western Shandong to the Taikang, Tongxu, and Qixian areas in eastern Henan. Because they were severely attacked by the National Army, they have returned to western Shandong in recent days. His two columns, 2 and 7, in Jiaodong have recently moved south to the border between Shandong and Jiangsu. Liu Bocheng led two columns from the Xixian and Gushi areas north of the Dabie Mountains and fled from south to northwest, wanting to cross the Huai River again to seek supplies. Chen Geng's bandit troops are moving northwest in western Henan, attempting to destroy the Longhai Railway again and threaten Luoyang. The National Army is currently pursuing all the bandits. It is expected that there will be fierce battles soon.</p>
<p>The Yichuan Campaign is Worthy of Song and Tears</p>
<p>In northern Shaanxi, Peng Dehuai led five columns of bandit troops to invade Yichuan, along with more than 80,000 militiamen who were coerced into joining. They formally encountered a National Army corps in the area of Shicun and Danyangzhen west of Guanchuan, launching a bloody battle. Both sides suffered losses. Senior generals of the National Army, such as Corps Commander Liu Kan and Division Commander Yan Ming, died heroically in battle, creating a heroic and moving historical event. This is the manifestation of the National Army's revolutionary spirit of sacrifice. This battle will have a more significant meaning for the future of bandit suppression than the heroic martyrdom of Division Commander Zhang Lingfu of Menglianggu last year.

<p>[U.S. Information Service, This City] Gilbert R. Layton, director of the U.S. Department of State's aid mission to China stationed in Shanghai, announced today that the U.S. transport ship "Steel Architect" arrived in Shanghai on the 10th carrying 495 long tons of U.S. relief rice. Since the launch of the "U.S. Aid" transport on January 12, the total amount of rice, wheat, and flour supplied by the United States has now exceeded a record of 70,000 long tons. Another ten ships carrying a total of 24,000 long tons of "U.S. Aid" relief rice are currently en route to China. Four of them have already left U.S. ports and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in the second half of this month. They are: "Shentang Victory" carrying 1,471 long tons of rice, "Pacific Transport" carrying 1,991 long tons of rice, "President Jefferson" carrying 415 long tons of war provisions, and "President McKinley" carrying 1,000 long tons of rice. The "U.S. Aid" program to China currently being implemented by the U.S. Aid Mission in Shanghai stipulates that a total of 176,000 long tons of staple grains will be delivered to China before July of this year.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling U.S. Relief Materials, as of March 8, a total of 589,938 bags of flour, 190,799 bags of wheat, and 196,132 bags of rice have been shipped to China, including 140,775 bags of flour shipped to Tianjin, and 5,000 bags of rice shipped to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Former UNRRA Staff in Shanghai Says Much Relief Goods are Wasted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 9th] The Evening Star today published an interview with An Lai, a former UNRRA staff member in Shanghai, along with a photograph, proving that most of the food and equipment provided by the United States to China are wasted or flow into the black market. It is claimed that "only a small portion of the relief goods are shipped out for essential use. Seventy-five fishing boats worth $2 million supplied by the United States to China are left unused. I still support relief to China, but it must be ensured that the relief is handled properly."</p>
<h3>Where Did the Circulation Coupons Go?</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] As a result of inflation in the Northeast, the credit of circulation coupons has plummeted. The amount issued may reach more than five trillion. However, during the issuance of circulation coupons, a strange phenomenon was discovered, that is, there is a severe shortage of chips in Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and other places, resulting in the use of promissory notes. The cash held by various banks and bureaus is far from the amount needed for expenditures. Where did the circulation coupons go? This has become a mystery. According to people familiar with finance, there are about three channels: (1) Bandits use them to purchase goods, which takes time. (2) Bandits smuggle them into Guannei for use. As a result, circulation coupons in Pingjin are flooded after the opening of Northeast trade exchanges. (3) Some were destroyed by artillery fire. This issue deserves special attention, because the destruction of the value of circulation coupons and the flow of materials to the bandit areas are both major loopholes in the Northeast economy.</p>
<h3>Legislative Principles Draft for Provincial and County Self-Government Begin with Provincial and County Councils and Will Be Submitted to the State Council</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The legislative principles of the Provincial and County Self-Government General Rules have been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Committee of the National Government and will soon be submitted to the State Council for discussion. The draft differs slightly from the one drafted by the Ministry of Interior. Among them, the principle of implementing self-government is to begin with provincial and county councils. After the council term expires, popular elections for county magistrates will be held. The term of this council period is rigidly stipulated in the draft, with county councils having a term of two years and provincial councils having a term of three years. After the term expires, popular elections for county magistrates will be held. When the number of popularly elected county magistrates in a province exceeds one-half of the total number of counties in the province, popular elections for provincial governors will be held.

<h3>If China is not Actively Aided, a Third World War May be Inevitable, Chennault Said While Testifying in the House</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] New York, 10th Broadcast: Washington News, General Chennault testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, forcefully arguing that military aid to China can help prevent "Soviet aggression in Europe"; otherwise, if such aid is not given to China, the world will embark on the road to a third world war, which is inevitable. Chen's statement, which he read, was thirteen pages long, in which he pointed out that if China's large population can be properly trained, equipped, and supplied, it can provide almost unlimited manpower for military operations. This manpower not being used by the Soviet Union is of the greatest significance to the United States. Given the importance of China's strategic position, it is not difficult to imagine that the Soviet Union would not dare to launch an offensive in Europe rashly before China is communized. In other words, as long as China remains our ally and friend, a third world war is unlikely to occur. The main points of Chen's testimony are as follows: (1) World peace is currently threatened by the expansionist policies pursued by communist leaders around the world; (2) A strong, independent, and anti-communist Chinese National Government is our only hope in Asia to stop communism and maintain world peace. Due to the important strategic position of China geographically, it must occupy an important position in the overall plan to prevent communism. If China becomes a communist country, then the Asian continent will be completely communized, leaving us with no foothold in Asia; (3) After more than ten years of war, China's resources have been exhausted. If the anti-communist National Government is to continue to exist, it must be given substantial military, economic, and financial assistance; (4) If the United States cannot provide adequate assistance to China at this time, it will cause the greatest failure in the history of our foreign policy, making a third world war inevitable.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Loan Decision to Proceed First, Industrial Loans to be Handled on a Case-by-Case Basis; Full Economic Council to Discuss Export Material Production Increase Plan Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Four Banks Joint Council will hold a routine meeting on the 11th to discuss agricultural and industrial loan plans. According to reliable sources, it has been decided that agricultural loans will be opened up first, while the opening of industrial loans will be temporarily slowed down. Instead, a case-by-case handling method will be adopted. For particularly important and urgently needed loans, the Four Banks Joint Council may consider the situation and approve them on a special case basis. This decision was made because the authorities, in view of the recent surge in prices, feared that the opening of industrial loans would further stimulate prices. Therefore, policymakers presented a compromise plan to the authorities, which was approved. On the one hand, the overall opening of industrial loans will be temporarily delayed, and on the other hand, the particularly urgent needs of industrial and mining loans will also be taken into account. The final decision will be made at the Four Banks Joint Council meeting on the 11th. In addition to the agricultural loan plan which is expected to be fully decided, the entire industrial loan plan will be temporarily postponed. Furthermore, the Full Economic Council's opinion that industrial loans should be coordinated with agricultural loans will also be raised for discussion at the Four Banks Joint Council meeting on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Full Economic Council is scheduled to hold a routine meeting on the 11th, chaired by Wang Yunwu, to discuss the increase production plans for four export materials proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry: tung oil, hog bristles, tea leaves, and sheep wool.</p>
<p>Promulgation of Income Tax Collection Law; Executive Yuan Has Not Changed the Law</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Director Dong Xian Guang answered reporters' inquiries regarding two issues on the 10th. (1) The recently announced "Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year" by the Executive Yuan is a set of collection procedures formulated based on laws and regulations, which falls within the scope of administrative orders and does not change the tax law. According to the Organic Law of the National Government, the State Council is the highest authority of the government and has the power to issue emergency administrative orders. During the period of mobilization for the suppression of rebellion, this measure is necessary to prevent delays in tax payment and to contract the currency. (2) "Measuring expenditure by income" is the principle of national financial management. The increase in the national annual revenue and expenditure budget and the income tax revenue budget this year are both around twenty times. The current six-fold estimation is just a prepayment of a portion of the tax. Moreover, the average price level in various places in the 36th year has increased by about fifteen times compared to the 35th year. Even if the level of profit does not increase and decrease completely in proportion to the price level, the monetary amount of income of various industries will inevitably increase and decrease with the amount of currency or the price level. Therefore, the six-fold estimation standard, from any perspective, is only a portion of the tax payable. The result of future audits is that, except for businesses that have actual losses, taxes will have to be made up. If it is determined that there are actual losses and a tax refund should be given, the government will also pay interest. The United Kingdom and the United States both implement the "pay as you earn" method, where the tax levied on income this year is the income of the previous year. In fact, the six-fold estimation is equivalent to a method of paying taxes in installments, not a pre-collection, which is beneficial to the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of the Ashida Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Japanese Katayama Cabinet resigned en masse on February 10th. After the Diet elected Hitoshi Ashida as Prime Minister, Ashida proceeded to organize a coalition cabinet. After half a month of twists and turns, Ashida finally overcame the risks and formed a coalition cabinet of the Democratic, Socialist, and Cooperative parties on the 9th of this month. In terms of policy, a three-party policy agreement has been established, and Ashida's future policy program has a guideline. In terms of personnel, the Democratic Party occupies six seats in the new cabinet, with Prime Minister Ashida concurrently serving as Foreign Minister; the Socialist Party occupies eight seats in the new cabinet, with Suehiro Nishio holding the position of Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister; and the Cooperative Party only occupies two seats, serving as an embellishment to the coalition government. Looking at the representative character of the Ashida cabinet's composition and its policy decisions, we can make the following observations about the future of the Ashida cabinet.</p>
<p>Regarding the criticism of the Ashida cabinet's character, it may be useful to compare and contrast it with the Katayama cabinet. The Katayama cabinet was led by the leader of the Socialist Party as Prime Minister, supported by the first-party seats in the House of Representatives, and its cabinet policy was based on the call to implement socialism, but it ended with a lifespan of only eight months and ten days. The reasons for this were due to the internal division between the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, the threat of the conservative New Party movement led by Yoshida, and the hesitation and indecision of Tetsu Katayama, which led to the inevitable downfall of the cabinet. However, the main factor in its failure was that the Socialist cabinet members valued the life of the cabinet more than the party's policies. When the two were difficult to reconcile, they had to embark on a path of disillusionment. In order to cherish the life of the regime, the Katayama cabinet had to make concessions to other parties, especially the Democratic Party, in everything. No policy that would have won the support of the Japanese working masses emerged. Even the Coal Mine National Management Bill, which was the most emphasized policy of the socialists, became a non-entity due to the pressure of the Democratic Party, with no socialist atmosphere at all. After the British Labour Party formed a cabinet, the first major event in domestic policy was the implementation of coal mine nationalization. Labour cabinet members and members of parliament were not afraid of difficulties or setbacks, and the British Labour Party finally achieved success and laid the foundation for today's stable political base. However, in the Katayama cabinet, because the experiment of socialism failed, it lost the support of the working masses. Its policies and achievements were the same as those of pure conservative cabinets like Shidehara and Yoshida, so it was bound to encounter failure. Now that the Ashida cabinet has been established, judging from its actions in forming the cabinet in eighteen days, the character of the Ashida cabinet is completely the same as that of the Katayama cabinet. It also values the life of the cabinet more than the life of the party, and its failure in the future seems to be predestined.</p>
<p>The three-party policy agreement that the Ashida cabinet regards as its guiding principle is completely centered on the Socialist Party's主張. Ashida has accepted more or less the Socialist Party's left-wing demands for agricultural land reform, revision of the Labor Union Law, suspension of interest payments on wartime public bonds, and the establishment of property taxes. Ashida himself is relatively conservative, a person who is center-right. His advocacy of revised capitalism lacks a solid theoretical foundation. His friendship with the left wing and acceptance of the left wing's proposals are purely due to the bureaucratic political concept of profit and power. As for whether it will work in the future or how it will work, he does not ask. Therefore, we say that the three-party policy agreement of the Ashida cabinet is more progressive in terms of provisions than the four-party policy agreement of the Katayama cabinet, but its results are likely to be more conservative, more right-leaning, and more difficult to cash in than the Katayama cabinet. In terms of the Ashida cabinet's personnel, the Socialist Party occupies eight cabinet seats, while the Democratic Party only occupies six, which shows that the Socialist Party occupies an absolute advantage in this new cabinet and has the power to manipulate and veto. There is no doubt that Ashida's future actions will inevitably accommodate the Socialist Party in everything, especially making concessions to the left wing of the Socialist Party. This time, the left wing occupies two seats in the cabinet, with Kajū Katō serving as the Minister of Labor and Masaru Nomizo serving as the Minister of State (without portfolio), which is difficult to cooperate with the right wing of the party and the Democratic Party. It is feared that the cabinet will break down due to friction, which is difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>Indeed, the emergence of the Ashida cabinet is mainly due to obtaining the understanding of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, especially the strong support of the left wing; otherwise, it would be suppressed by opposition parties such as the Liberal Party, the All-Farmers faction, and the Comrades Club in the Diet. Why does Ashida tolerate the left wing? As mentioned above, he is driven by the pursuit of profit and power, and his purpose is not to use this as a decoration of "democracy," directly deceiving the Japanese working masses and indirectly creating the "stability" of the cabinet. Therefore, in his mind, there is no intention to accept their proposals at all. However, Ashida Hitoshi has a "far-reaching" revenge that we must point out: he intends to seize favorable circumstances when the Japanese peace conference is convened to create a "victory of Japan's defeat." He also intends to use the contradiction between the United States and the Soviet Union under the slogan of anti-Sovietism to win greater material assistance from the United States in order to revive Japanese militarism. This is his political ambition! This newspaper's editorial on February 24th pointed out that Ashida's appearance on stage, full of ambition, will inevitably take Japanese politics a step backward and a step reactionary. Ashida's political foundation is an old form of Japan, and he may brazenly and resolutely revive militarism. This is what we worry about. As for the weaknesses of the Ashida cabinet, they lie in the unsoundness of its policies and personnel. Therefore, its life is likely to be shorter than that of the Katayama cabinet. Although Ashida himself is known as a "cold talent," judging from his ability to form a cabinet this time, it is difficult to overcome the contradictions between the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, and the damage caused to the cabinet by the opposition between the left and right wings of the Socialist Party. Now that Takao Saito, the honorary president of the Democratic Party, has left the party, and the Taiyo Society has raised the banner against the left wing, Ashida's style of befriending fellow party members while alienating his comrades shows that he is so focused on power that he may not even need the support of the masses and comrades. This bureaucratic style will not be abandoned by the times unless the world is completely running against the tide. Therefore, we predict that the life of the Ashida cabinet and Ashida's personal political life will be a very short page in Japanese political history. We believe that this is Japan's misfortune. After Ashida's failure in the future, it is possible that more conservative and stubborn figures than Ashida will emerge, which will further create Japan's misfortune. In short, Japanese politics is increasingly turning backward. The political evolution of the past two years has truly given people a feeling that each generation is not as good as the previous one.</p>

Today, the Philippine side was represented by Presidential Secretary Abello and Manila Mayor Forte, who held a meeting with our Minister Chen on behalf of the government.</p>

In addition to ensuring that military grain can be submitted on schedule, the Central Government has no grain purchase requirements in the province. Regarding the continued rise in grain prices in Shanghai, Yu believes that there is no need to worry about it, because after the implementation of rationing, grain merchants can no longer manipulate the market.

<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 10th] Zhejiang grain merchants previously purchased 40,000 zu (unit of grain) of rice in Jiangxi Province due to a shortage of grain. However, the grain could not be transported to Zhejiang because the Jiangxi Provincial Government banned grain from leaving the province. After the Zhejiang Provincial Delegation to Jiangxi Province negotiated the exchange of materials between the two provinces, the Jiangxi Provincial Government agreed to release the grain. Therefore, more than 1,000 bags of rice have been entering the province via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway every day, which has alleviated the rice shortage.

<h3>National Federation of Highway Workers' Unions to be Established in Beijing Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Federation of Highway Workers' Unions of the Republic of China is now ready and will be established tomorrow, the 11th, at 10:00 AM. The first general assembly of representatives will also be convened to elect the first board of directors. Miao Yin-sheng, Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee, and Gui Yun-kang, Secretary-General, reported at a press conference on the afternoon of the 10th that the main tasks of the Federation after its establishment will be to organize highway workers in various regions, fully leverage their road maintenance and transportation efficiency, assist the government in suppressing rebellion, and strive to improve employee welfare and secure reasonable treatment. [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] An Fu-ting, Chairman of the China Labor Association, expressed extreme contempt for Zhu Xue-fan's theft of his name and his absurd remarks made in the bandit-controlled area of ​​Harbin. According to An, Zhu Xue-fan fled in fear of punishment after being wanted by the court for corruption. The chairmanship of the China Labor Association was then re-elected. Currently, Zhu has no union membership in the country and cannot represent this body, let alone Chinese workers. This association has already issued statements both domestically and abroad. The Chinese Seamen's Union, Postal Workers' Union, Railway Workers' Union, and others have also jointly stated that they do not recognize his qualifications to represent Chinese workers. In the past, we have viewed all of Zhu's actions as those of a communist bandit accomplice, and he has long been expelled from the Kuomintang. He is essentially a fugitive criminal who shamelessly claims to be a disciple of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and impersonates a representative of Chinese workers in an attempt to confuse the public. This is extremely shameless, and the fact that the communist bandits harbor such scum proves that birds of a feather flock together.</p>

<h3>Measures for Clearing Land Tax in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Measures for Clearing Land Tax in Various Provinces, passed by the Executive Yuan a few days ago, are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: Except for counties (cities) that have already conducted simple land declaration and clearing, or measurement and registration, and have thoroughly organized their cadastral records, the land tax in various provinces shall be cleared in accordance with the provisions of these measures. However, counties and cities with the manpower and financial resources to carry out land consolidation shall still carry out land consolidation.</p>
<p>Article 2: The work of collecting land tax in various provinces shall be carried out by the provincial government in conjunction with the provincial grain authority, together with the finance and land administration authorities, to formulate practical plans and measures. After approval by the central government, the county (city) governments shall be ordered to supervise the county (city) grain authorities to implement them.</p>
<p>Article 3: When counties (cities) conduct land tax clearing, the county (city) government shall supervise the county (city) grain authority to establish an investigation team. The county (city) magistrate shall concurrently serve as the team leader, and the director of the county (city) grain office or the head of the grain section shall concurrently serve as the deputy team leader. The team shall be divided into several sub-teams, each with one technician and a number of investigators. The technician shall concurrently serve as the sub-team leader, and the township head shall concurrently serve as the sub-team deputy, supervising the investigators and the Bao-Tian chiefs to carry out the work.</p>
<p>The aforementioned investigators shall be recruited from the land tax collectors of various townships and towns as much as possible. When necessary, temporary technicians and employees may be selected and hired. In addition to technicians and employees who may be given allowances and travel expenses according to local prices, the rest shall be unpaid, but may be given public travel expenses.</p>
<p>Article 4: During the period of land tax clearing in each county (city), the county (city) government and the county (city) grain authority shall select senior personnel to conduct roving supervision in various districts and pay appropriate travel expenses.</p>
<p>Article 5: The procedure for clearing land tax is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Field-by-field investigation: Land tax clearing shall be carried out by township as a unit. Investigators shall be dispatched, together with the township head, to survey the boundaries of the county (city) township (town) and erect markers. The natural terrain within a township (town), such as mountains, rivers, and roads, shall be used as reference, and the existing Bao boundaries shall be consulted to divide the township into several sections. Before investigating each field in each section, the technician shall first measure the standard fields of various types in the section to determine their area as the standard for converting the area during the field-by-field investigation. Then, the investigators shall carry land registers and, together with the local Bao-Tian chief, investigate the location, boundaries, acreage, yield, income, land price, tax amount, land type, land quality, owner's name, address, user's name, address, and other items of the land field by field and register them one by one in the land register (the format of the register will be determined separately). The register shall be numbered sequentially, starting and ending with each section.</p>
<p>(2) Verification of Deeds by Household: After the land investigation of each section is completed, the sub-team shall immediately notify the owners, together with the township office, to bring their deeds, grain strings, and other relevant documents to the township office where the land is located for verification. After receiving the above documents, the investigators shall immediately check them one by one against the items investigated in the land register. If the verification is correct, the owner, Bao chief, and the person in charge shall affix their seals or fingerprints on the land register, and affix a "Verified" stamp on the upper left corner of the original deed, and issue a deed verification certificate together with the original documents. If there is any discrepancy, the discrepancy shall be investigated and the original deed or register shall be corrected accordingly. The correction shall be stamped with the private seal of the person in charge to show caution. For public and jointly owned land, the names and addresses of the representatives and co-owners shall be filled in detail in the remarks column. If it is a white deed (a deed without official stamp), it shall be registered in a separate register (the format of the register will be determined separately), and the tax shall be waived for three months after the deed verification. For land without a deed, the owner shall obtain a certificate from the neighborhood Bao-Jia chief, and the county (city) government shall issue a public notice. If no objection is raised within one month, the ownership shall be recognized, and the penalty for tax evasion shall be waived and the tax shall be levied lightly within three months after the expiration of the public notice period. If the tax is still not paid after the deadline, the penalties shall be imposed in accordance with the current measures for fines for deed tax evasion.</p>
<p>A fee may be charged for the aforementioned deed verification certificate and land register to cover the cost of materials. The charging standard shall be drafted by the provincial government and reported to the Ministry of Food for approval.</p>
<p>When an owner presents a deed for verification, he shall report his real name. If he does not use his real name, he shall be punished in accordance with the regulations on the restriction of the use of names after investigation. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Only Two Weeks After the Communist Coup in Czechoslovakia, Masaryk Jumped to His Death: Son of Founding Father Sacrifices Himself for the People</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Prague, 10th] The family of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk stated on the 10th that Masaryk committed suicide by jumping from the Qiu Ning Palace official residence, fourteen days after the communist coup. Masaryk was the son of Thomas Masaryk, the founding father and first president of Czechoslovakia, and was 61 years old this year. His family said that he had been depressed since the political turmoil on the 25th of last month. After announcing his willingness to continue serving, he refused to meet with old friends and Western journalists. On Sunday evening, after attending an official banquet commemorating his father's 99th birthday, he wandered alone by the tomb of the elder Masaryk. He committed suicide on the 10th. Masaryk is the second person to jump out of a window and commit suicide after the coup. Former Minister of Justice Doutetna also attempted to jump out of a window and commit suicide, resulting in a fractured skull.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 10th] An official gazette from the Czech Prime Minister's Office stated: "As a result of illness and insomnia, Foreign Minister Masaryk ended his life, which he had dedicated to the country, on the 10th. His decision to commit suicide was likely made in a moment of mental breakdown." An hour later, another announcement was issued stating, "On the day before Masaryk's tragic death or last night, he did not show any signs of mental abnormality."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 10th] An hour after announcing Masaryk's jump to his death, Prime Minister Gotwald issued a message to the Czech people, stating: "People of Czechoslovakia, this is not a time for despair. Although a great man has left us, it should not be assumed that the situation in our country will worsen due to his death. We hope that the public will remain calm, continue their work as usual, and that gatherings and demonstrations will not be allowed except to express mourning. Our enemies of freedom may use this opportunity to incite disturbances, which the authorities will resolutely deal with."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 10th] A few moments before noon today, Prague was almost completely isolated from the outside world. Outgoing telephone calls were not connected, and service was not restored until the official announcement was issued.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] As of now, there have been no public demonstrations in the Czech capital. Only small groups of two or three people can be seen whispering on the streets, with grief overflowing from their faces. The government has ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast, and private residences have also voluntarily hung black flags to express mourning. Although the general public is shocked, they are all cautious.</p>
<h3>The World Is Greatly Shocked: Masaryk's Neutral Force Unable to Exert Influence, the Communist Party's Usurpation of Power Completely Exposed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] After learning of the death of the Czech Foreign Minister, Truman's Press Secretary Ross made the following statement: "The President has just learned of Masaryk's suicide by telephone. Before issuing a formal statement tonight, the President wishes to state that he believes that the suicide of this great man was not due to a nervous breakdown or insomnia, but due to the great political changes in that country over the past two weeks." Secretary of State Marshall said that the representative opinion he had received was that Masaryk was forced to accept the position of Foreign Minister. "When I learned that Masaryk had decided to accept a position in a regime condemned by democratic countries, I was very surprised. His suicide proves that a government controlled by the Communist Party cannot be tolerated by the son of the founder of the Czech Republic."</p>
<p>Success Lake was shocked to learn of Masaryk's death.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Diplomatic circles here believe that Masaryk's suicide has exposed the facade of the government controlled by the Czech Communist Party. His continued service in the government after the coup was cited by freedom-thinking elements who supported the new government as proof that the recent coup was unconstitutional. From the perspective of foreign public opinion, Masaryk's participation in the new Czech government was even more important than that of President Benes, as he was the son of the creator of the Czech Republic, the elder Masaryk, and was nothing less than a symbol of the traditional democratic spirit of the Czech Republic. His jump to his death has proven that his continued tenure as Foreign Minister and his public statements about the coup were the result of coercion. Some people also said that Masaryk's failure to immediately withdraw from the cabinet was originally intended to maintain some neutral force in the new government, but since the government reorganization, followed by the purge and various measures to destroy freedom, it is clear that the neutral force has been unable to exert influence, and he had no choice but to resort to suicide. Democratic people here believe that Masaryk's death is nothing less than a final protest against the Czech coup twenty-one days ago.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] After learning of the suicide of the Czech Foreign Minister, a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry said that the French government deeply regrets the death of this great man at this time, which proves that the Communist Party's control of the entire Czech Republic has sentenced democracy to death.</p>
<h3>Czech New Government Clears Dissidents</h3>
<p>Benes' Brother Resigns as Member of Parliament, an Employee of the U.S. Consulate Arrested</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 9th] The U.S. Embassy in Czechoslovakia announced that Spiro, a Czech translator at the U.S. Consulate in Bratislava, was arrested by the Czech authorities on the evening of the 8th and interrogated on charges of "conspiracy to treason." U.S. officials in Washington said that the Czech Communist Party-controlled government was trying to manufacture evidence of a "spy conspiracy" and intended to involve U.S. diplomats. Spiro's arrest may be the first step in the plan. An official said that the new Czech government continues to consolidate its power, purge opposition leaders, amend Czech laws, and recruit new party members to strengthen the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 9th] President Benes' brother, Vojtech Benes, has resigned as a member of the Social Democratic Party in the Czech Parliament. It is also learned that the "Slovak Democratic Party" has decided to change its name to the "Slovak Regeneration Party" by a decision of the party's action committee. Former party chairman Litry Chu and several members of parliament have been expelled from the party.</p>
<h3>Masaryk's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Jan (given name) Masaryk (family name), 61 years old, is the son of Thomas (given name) Masaryk (family name), the founding father and first President of Czechoslovakia. After last week's coup, his continued service as Foreign Minister in the new government controlled by the Communist Party surprised Western observers. Masaryk was approachable, a firm believer in Western democracy, and had a close friendship with British and American diplomats. He has been the Czech Foreign Minister since 1940, first in the London government-in-exile, and continued to serve as Foreign Minister after returning to the country after liberation. He was a non-partisan. He was born in Vienna and studied in Prague and New York. In 1938, he was originally the Czech Ambassador to the United Kingdom, but he resigned that winter after the Munich Agreement was signed. He entered the diplomatic service after the establishment of the Czech Republic and had served in the Czech Embassy in London for sixteen years until he resigned as Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1938. He first served as a counselor, and then in 1925 he was transferred to be the Ambassador until 1938. In 1939, he went to the United States to lecture. When he returned to London, Czechoslovakia had been annexed by the Nazis, so he washed his hands and participated in the Czech National Committee. In 1941, the Czech provisional government-in-exile led by Benes was recognized by the Allies, and he was appointed as Foreign Minister. In 1945, he represented Czechoslovakia at the first United Nations conference. Masaryk was poor in his early years. In 1907, he was a worker in an iron factory. Later, he worked as a pianist in a theater. Finally, he became a director of the Klein Steel Plant. His wife, Frances Klein, was the daughter of the U.S. Minister to Beijing, China in 1924.

<h3>Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia Will Sign a Treaty of Mutual Assistance</h3>

<h3>Five Countries Reach Complete Agreement on Draft Treaty of Western European Union, to be Formally Signed Within the Next Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 10th] Langerhoven, the Belgian chief representative participating in the Five-Nation Western European Union Conference, recently announced to reporters that the five countries have reached a complete agreement in principle on all outstanding points of the Western European Union Treaty. The treaty will be ready to be submitted to the foreign ministers of the five countries within two days. Langerhoven reiterated that the agreement has been reached and there are no outstanding issues. Some compromises have been reached. The Western European Union can be said to have become a reality.</p>
<p>At the request of reporters, Langerhoven explained in detail that the foreign ministers of the countries concerned will meet in Paris on the 16th of this month to discuss the Marshall Plan.

All of the above steps are expected to be completed before the end of this month. He also said that the reason why we are speeding up is that time cannot be wasted.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Propose Defense Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 9th] The new proposals put forward by Britain, which are intended to extend the mutual assistance provisions in the Western Alliance Convention to the overseas territories of each participating country, were considered by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg tonight. It is reported that the British proposal has been agreed to by France. Its goal is to bind the five countries into a strong organization with a permanent central advisory body and to integrate the overseas territories of each participating country into the Western European Union. According to reliable sources, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have already accepted the amendments proposed by Britain to the draft Western European Union Convention on various issues. However, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg believe that the British proposal regarding overseas territories is too far from the provision in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg draft that mutual assistance is limited to the home country, so they are not yet willing to accept it immediately. Belgian representative Langerhoven today also denied the statement made by a U.S. news agency that the five countries had asked the United States to provide military guarantees.</p>

Italian workers are all seeking assistance under the Marshall Plan. He also believes that the European recovery plan must fully cooperate with the trade unions of various countries, and each country must fully utilize the assistance to improve the living standards of the trade unions.

<h3>U.S. Advises Arab-Jewish Reconciliation on Palestine Partition Issue, U.S.-Soviet Policies Gradually Becoming Uncoordinated</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake, 9th] Coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Palestine issue in the United Nations appeared to have ended on the 9th. A senior Soviet official told visitors that the United States is "hesitating and indecisive" about implementing the United Nations' plan to partition the Holy Land. He said that U.S. officials seem to want to reopen the Holy Land issue and start over. U.S. Representative Austin replied in an official statement that the Soviet official "did not wait for the recent termination of the discussion of the great powers and immediately speculated on the matter." This U.S.-Soviet discord is the culmination of developments in all aspects, and the behind-the-scenes situation is also becoming tense. The United Nations Secretariat believes that the Security Council has the right to support the partition plan with international military force, which has been protested by the United States. The extent of the U.S.-Soviet split cannot be immediately determined, but some observers believe that Austin's statement is a signal that months of coordination are coming to an end. The position of the United Nations Secretariat has been supported by the Soviet Union, at least in part. Other major developments are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A senior Soviet official said that the Soviet Union will insist that the United Nations' plan to partition the Holy Land must be implemented, while other countries (presumably China, the United States, and France) seem to be hesitant about implementing this plan. (2) A U.S. spokesperson said that the United States is advising the Arab Higher Committee to abandon its boycott of the United Nations and participate in the ongoing negotiations of the great powers. The United States is also asking the seven Arab League countries to persuade the Arab Committee to negotiate with any of the five great powers or the Security Council. (3) According to a major power, there has been some "talk" proposing to extend the date of partition and the establishment of the United Nations trusteeship. (4) The emergency talks of the great powers reopened on the 9th, and British officials also attended and participated, but they only agreed to provide information and were unwilling to participate in the implementation of the partition plan.</p>

<h3>"Explorer" Returns to U.S. with "Illness," Survey of Mount積石 Postponed, 雷諾 Announces Pen Manufacturing in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The special plane "Explorer" of the 雷諾積石 Mountain Exploration Team, which had been stranded at the Longhua Airport in this city for many days, finally took off at 3:45 pm yesterday. However, the destination was no longer Nanjing, but Los Angeles in the United States, which will postpone the surveying and exploration work of Sino-American Mount積石 by two weeks. 雷諾 specifically held a press conference at 5 pm yesterday to explain the matter. It is said that the "Explorer" special plane had been thoroughly inspected before leaving the United States, and all parts were intact. However, after arriving at Wake Island overnight, oil leakage was discovered in the cylinder, which was repaired. After arriving in Shanghai and preparing to fly to Beijing, two new gaps were found in the oil cylinder. Although it was rushed to repair, the cylinder function could not be restored to normal. The hourly oil leakage was about half a gallon, so the plane had to be flown back to Los Angeles for thorough repair. The preparation for surveying and exploration work has cost a lot so far. Even the round trip to the United States costs as much as US$25,000. However, since the "Explorer" has oil leakage symptoms, there may be a risk of explosion during the flight. The driver 奥登 is carrying all the necessary defense equipment and is willing to take the risk to fly the plane. Zhu Chao, a lieutenant in the Air Force of 山國, is also willing to fly to the United States with the plane to gain more flight experience, which is commendable. The special plane will be repaired for about two weeks before it can return to China. I plan to take another flight to Beijing on the morning of the 11th with Major Yang Dize and others to discuss the progress plan of surveying and exploration work with the scientists staying in Beijing, or will go to Lanzhou together first to carry out preparatory work.</p>
<p>Finally, 雷諾 talked about his plan to set up an atomic pen factory in Shanghai. He said: "The factory plan has been sponsored by Madam Chiang Kai-shek, and he has prepared all the machinery and equipment for setting up the factory. It is expected to start manufacturing in Shanghai after April. All the profits from the factory will be allocated to Madam Chiang Kai-shek for charitable relief work."</p>
<h3>Airfares to Be Adjusted Starting Tomorrow, Approved by Ministry of Communications, Increase of 45%, International Routes Still Converted at Original Foreign Currency Prices</h3>
<p>The fares of all routes of China Central and China National Aviation Corporations have been approved by the Ministry of Communications to increase by 45% based on the original price starting from the 12th. According to Liu Jingyi, the general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, it has been more than a month since the civil aviation fares were adjusted on February 7. During this period, foreign exchange and gasoline prices have been increased repeatedly, especially the sharp increase in the cost of living, which has made the company unbearable. The authorities of the two companies requested the Ministry of Communications to adjust the fares at the end of February. The Ministry of Communications approved the request on the 10th. From the end of February to March 11, the price increase rate was very rapid, especially the increase of 46,000 yuan in foreign exchange, which gave the airline a great stimulus. According to the current expenditure of the company, it should increase by 52.5% based on the original price. Therefore, although the fare has been adjusted, the actual difference between revenue and expenditure is still 7.5%. The calculation method of civil aviation fares is based on the amount of expenditure on foreign exchange, gasoline, and cost of living. The prices of the main routes after the price increase are as follows: (1) Shanghai-Beijing Route: 990,000 yuan. (2) Shanghai-Chongqing Route: 8,225,000 yuan. (3) Beijing-Chongqing Route: 5,180,000 yuan. (4) Shanghai-Hankou Route: 6,670,000 yuan. (5) Hankou-Chongqing Route: 5,945,000 yuan. (6) Shanghai-Guangzhou Route: 7,395,000 yuan. (7) Shanghai-Hong Kong Route: 11,600,000 yuan. (8) Shanghai-Kunming Route: 7,715,000 yuan. (9) Shanghai-Taiwan Route: 28,855,000 yuan. International routes are still converted at the original foreign currency prices.</p>
<p>Overpaid Fares Can Be Refunded</p>
<p>[Another News] According to the person in charge of China National Aviation Corporation, the Ministry of Communications telegraphed the two companies before the 10th of this month, stating that the fare would increase by 30% starting from March 11. Therefore, the tickets sold by China National Aviation Corporation on the 10th for the 11th had already increased by 30% based on the original price. On the 10th, the Ministry of Communications telegraphed again to approve the adjustment to 45% and decided to implement it starting from the 12th. Therefore, China National Aviation Corporation has stipulated that passengers flying from Shanghai to various places on the 11th can hold their tickets and go to the company's offices in various places to refund the overpaid fares. [Central News Agency Beiping, 10th] The new airfares of China National Aviation Corporation are: (1) (C/47) type aircraft: Beiping-Tianjin: 1,000,000 yuan, Beiping-Jinan: 3,000,000, Beiping-Qingdao: 5,800,000, Beiping-Nanjing: 10,070,000, Beiping-Shanghai: 11,190,000, Beiping-Taiyuan: 3,800,000, Beiping-Xi'an: 5,180,000, Beiping-Suiyuan: 2,800,000, Beiping-Ningxia: 8,000,000, Beiping-Lanzhou: 11,150,000, Beiping-Chongqing: 14,700,000, Beiping-Hankou: 8,700,000. (2) Skymaster aircraft: Beiping-Qingdao: 7,500,000, Beiping-Shanghai: 15,500,000.

<h3>Stolen Jewelry Box Recovered; Dismissed Tea Server of Yu Feng Company Awakens from Dream to Find Himself Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At Yu Feng Jewelry Company, 440 Hankou Road, a white iron rectangular jewelry box containing more than 500 new and old shiny pearls (worth 600-700 million yuan) and 1 million yuan in legal tender was stolen from a window display drawer on the night of the 9th. The theft was discovered at around 7:00 AM the next morning. The Lao Zha Police Station was notified at noon, and the head of the Criminal Investigation Section, Jiang Shangpei, ordered officer Tang Zhiliang and Sergeant Chen Junqian to rush to the scene for investigation. It was observed that the thief had climbed down from the back door of the Securities Building, broken open the back door, used a small knife to pry open the plywood accounting room door, opened the cargo cabinet, and escaped with the jewelry box. After questioning the shop employees, Sergeant Chen and others learned that Xu Amin, a 20-year-old Shaoxing native who had been dismissed as a tea server at the end of the lunar year, was highly suspicious. They first went to Gu Xingnan's home at 11 Zhongde Lane, Beijing Road, Xu's guarantor, to inquire about Xu's whereabouts.

<h3>Comrades from Three Parties in Shanghai Hold Get-Together to Strengthen Ties and Share Responsibility for National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party held a get-together tea party at the New Life Club on the afternoon of the 10th to strengthen ties between friendly parties and invited central figures from the three parties to participate. Those who attended included members of the Kuomintang Central Committee staying in Shanghai Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Qian Dajun, Hong Ludong, Wu Kaixian, Chen Shiquan, and Xiao Jishan; members of the Youth Party Central Committee Xia Taosheng, Jiang Weizhi, Wang Lanseng, and Song Yiqing; members of the Democratic Socialist Party Central Committee Jin Longzhang and Wu Zheng; and over eighty committee members and working comrades from the three parties' municipal party headquarters.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the heads of the three parties in Shanghai first introduced the attendees from their respective parties. Then, Fang Zhi, chairman of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, saying: "Today's get-together of the three parties is a rare opportunity. The current government is jointly responsible for the three parties and social elites, with the aim of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. At this time of suppressing bandits and quelling disturbances, the three parties bear the responsibility for national rejuvenation. We should uphold the spirit of collective wisdom and effort and strive to suppress bandits and build the nation. In particular, friendly parties in Shanghai should unite sincerely, win the trust of the citizens, and the Communist bandits attempt to destroy the country and seize power by force. For the survival of the entire country, the three parties should be aware and vigilant. He continued, "To stabilize Shanghai, the three parties must first concentrate their efforts to eliminate the Communist bandits' underground workers in Shanghai, extinguish the Communist bandits' instigated labor and student unrest, and guard against scheming politicians engaging in various activities. Shanghai is the lifeline of the country. Comrades from the three parties should maintain close contact, cooperate, protect Greater Shanghai, and stabilize Greater Shanghai." Jiang Weizhi, chairman of the Youth Party Municipal Party Headquarters, then spoke, saying: (1) The get-together of the three parties is of profound significance. In the future, it is hoped that various issues related to the nation and Shanghai (including political and economic issues) will be raised before the meetings so that the three parties can exchange views. (2) Eliminating the Communist bandits has always been the party's consistent advocacy. The three parties participating in the government must unite sincerely and demonstrate the power of party politics. Jin Longyi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party's Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, said: Any post-war country must first stabilize society, develop rural construction, remove all obstacles, and engage in national reconstruction. It is hoped that the three parties will work together to build the nation during the period of suppressing bandits and quelling disturbances. Xia Taosheng, director of the Youth Party's Organization Department, said: It is hoped that the three parties will have reliable plans for rural land policy, which will be implemented in conjunction with political and economic measures. The three parties in Shanghai should cooperate, eliminate estrangement, assist friendly parties in development, and enable the three parties to jointly shoulder the responsibility for national reconstruction. Wu Zheng, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party's Central Committee, said: It is hoped that the three parties will maintain contact at all times and promote the style of party politics. Pan Gongzhan said: In order to ensure the survival of the country and the thorough implementation of its principles, the three parties should truly cooperate, live and die together, and fight for national reconstruction. The tea party ended at 6:00 PM, followed by entertainment performances, which ended around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>New Giant Aircraft to Arrive; Central Air Transport Corporation Dispatches Personnel to the United States for Training; Departure Set for the 17th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Central Air Transport Corporation recently ordered six Conval giant aircraft from the American Ford Company, which are scheduled to be shipped to China before the summer of this year, in order to improve flight performance and passenger safety and comfort. Ford Company is famous for manufacturing B24 Liberator bombers during the war. In recent years, it has used improved equipment to equip the Conval aircraft, increasing the speed to 300 miles per hour. The company has also developed five flight routes for Central Air Transport Corporation. The fastest aircraft is equipped with high-altitude flight equipment and large engines for rapid flight on major routes. After the implementation of this plan, the flight time between Shanghai and Hong Kong can be shortened from five hours to three hours, the flight time between Shanghai and Peiping can be shortened to two and a half hours, and the flight time between Shanghai and Hankou will only take one and a half hours. In order to train specialized technical personnel to use this type of aircraft, the Central Air Transport Corporation authorities have selected dozens of experienced ground staff for practical training in the United States. It is reported that the first batch of personnel to be sent abroad for training includes Lu Lincai, chief of the company's maintenance division; Min Chuanlin, chief of the maintenance division; Ma Yaoqiu, Xu Baosheng, and Lou Guodong, field technicians and liquid stock, a total of five people. They are scheduled to take a plane on the 17th of this month and depart from their destination to San Diego, California, for a three-month training period. The training procedures are all prescribed by Central Air Transport Corporation. The main items are aircraft maintenance, operation training, and simplification of flight time. At the same time, Cai Kefei, secretary of the airline's aviation team; He Buyu, chief of the accounting division; and Cai Zhiren, director of the Shanghai station, will also travel to the United States on the same plane to study route administration. It is reported that Central Air Transport Corporation plans to send the second batch of inspection division chief Xie Guosheng, Xu Daoquan, and others abroad for training after the first batch of trainees completes their training.</p>
<h3>Arsenal Storekeeper Sells Firearms; Case Cracked; Intercepted in Hotel While Negotiating Delivery; 言思源 and Four Other Criminals to be Escorted to the Capital Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Independent Third Battalion of the Shanghai Garrison Constabulary recently cracked a case of selling firearms, intercepted three revolvers, one pistol, and over one hundred rounds of ammunition during the delivery, and seized a light machine gun, a quick-firing rifle, a revolver, and forty rounds of ammunition. Four criminals were arrested. Because the criminals have military identities, they will be escorted to the capital for interrogation within days.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the Garrison Headquarters of the Nanjing Constabulary received a confidential report from special agents stationed in Suzhou stating that Yi and others, officials of a certain arsenal in Shanghai, were peddling firearms in Suzhou and agreed to deliver them in Shanghai. The Garrison Headquarters immediately secretly ordered the Independent Third Battalion and special agents stationed in Shanghai to conduct an investigation. Battalion Commander Xie Chaozhen attached great importance to this case. After a month of rigorous investigation, it was learned that the criminals often opened a room in a small hotel in Zhabei to negotiate the sale of firearms. Plainclothes constables disguised themselves as hotel tea servers and travelers, eavesdropping on conversations in the next room and monitoring their actions. For several consecutive days, details of the criminals' names, addresses, service units, and negotiation process were thoroughly understood. On the 6th of this month, the date of delivery was negotiated. When the time came, Battalion Commander Xie dispatched armed and plainclothes personnel to hide nearby and wait. Around 4:00 PM that afternoon, it was seen that Wang Siyuan, the arsenal storekeeper, was carrying a package into the hotel. The constables waiting saw that the time was ripe, rushed forward, and arrested Wang. The package he was carrying contained three revolvers, one pistol, and over one hundred rounds of ammunition. Based on Wang's confession and the clues obtained from the investigation, the accomplices Wang Bingni, Di Qingshan, and Yi Guohua were arrested at the arsenal, along with the relevant senior officials. A light machine gun, a quick-firing rifle, and a revolver, all hidden and awaiting sale, were found in the homes of the two criminals, Wang and Di, along with forty rounds of ammunition. All criminals in the case are currently being held at the Independent Third Battalion of the Constabulary. According to Battalion Commander Xie: the personnel responsible for guarding the arms and ammunition engaged in embezzlement, stealing the arms and ammunition and selling them privately. This not only violates the law, but also affects social security, which is extremely sinful. It is reported that when the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters held a garrison meeting a few days ago, Commander Xuan also took note of this and ordered strict inspections and precautions against institutions responsible for guarding arms and ammunition in the future, so as to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.</p>

<h3>Wu Yun Chu and Others Travel to the Capital Yesterday to Seek Solutions to the Industrial Crisis</h3>
<p>Wu Yun Chu, chairman of the China National Federation of Industries, and executive directors Tao Guilin, Shen Silang, Pan Yangshan, Yin Zhizhong, chief secretary Zhuang Zhihuan, and others, six people in total, took a late night train to the capital yesterday. This morning, they will carry a letter and meet with the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other authorities. According to Wu: This trip was entrusted to the Industrial Association, because the industry has suffered a serious blow before IT. If it is not resolved, with the shrinking production of local products, China's economy will become more difficult, the problem of worker unemployment will expand, and social security will also be affected. I hope that the central authorities will pay close attention to it.</p>

<h3>Fertilizer and Explosives: Inside View of the Yongli Chemical Company Ammonia Plant</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the First World War, the first thing the Allied Powers did in exerting pressure on Germany was to make Germany announce the method of synthesizing nitrogen from the air. (Nitrogen refers to ammonia, formerly known as , which was renamed after the Ministry of Education announced the chemical naming principles in November of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The Yongli Ammonia Plant should also be called the Ammonium Plant. Therefore, this article, except for referring to the factory name as the Ammonia Plant as before, generally uses the word "ammonium.") Because synthetic ammonia is an important substance for manufacturing ammonium salts and nitrate fertilizers in peacetime chemical industries, but the equipment for manufacturing can be easily transformed into war industries when necessary, manufacturing powerful explosives. Before this war, Japan's fertilizer industry was highly developed. When the war of aggression was launched, all the fertilizer industries were forcibly transformed into industries manufacturing military chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid.</p>
<p>Shouldering Two Missions Alone</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hou Debang (General Manager of Yongli and an internationally renowned authority in China's chemical industry) after returning from Japan:</p>
<p>"The production of Japan's fertilizer industry has recovered to 900,000 tons per year, not far from the pre-war peak of 1.2 million tons. Moreover, the Allied Headquarters has decided that the fertilizer industry will absolutely not be used for compensation, and has approved an annual output of over 2 million tons. Clever Japanese chemical industrialists are disguising and preserving all kinds of munitions industries, laying the foundation for the resurgence of aggressive forces." (See "Neptune" Volume 20, Issue 6)</p>
<p>While Japan's fertilizer and explosives chemical industries survived under MacArthur's protection, we should think about ourselves. The work of the Yongli Chemical Company's Ammonia Plant cannot be ignored. China's vast farmlands need fertilizer, and the long national defense lines need explosives. This arduous supply mission seems to fall on Yongli's shoulders at present.</p>
<p>Xiejia Dian's Convenient Waterway</p>
<p>A dozen kilometers downstream from Nanjing, across the river, there is a good deep bay, an inland port where 25,000-ton ships can dock, called Xiejia Dian. Not only is the waterway convenient, but it is also very close to Pukou, the end of the Jinpu Railway. Mr. Fan Xudong, the leader of China's chemical industry, focused on transportation, security, and other conditions, and established Yongli's second largest business here—the Ammonia Plant.</p>
<p>The Ammonia Plant originally occupied 1,500 acres of land, and has now expanded to more than 2,000 acres. Although it only started production on February 5th of the 26th year of the Republic of China, it was suspended half a year later due to the war approaching Nanjing. The responsible personnel disassembled the gauges and control components on the remaining machines after the bombing and moved west with the government. During the period of occupation, it was wantonly ruined by the Japanese invaders for six years. The efforts of the Yongli authorities ensured that they did not fail the opportunity granted by victory. Today, more than a year after resuming work, seeing the precious achievements of the Ammonia Plant in overcoming all difficulties is a pleasant surprise that China actually has a thriving industry, and it also makes people resent the abundance of blind waste and madness in destruction.</p>
<p>Ammonium Sulfate Manufacturing Process</p>
<p>The manufacturing of ammonium sulfate has six important steps. Mr. Xie Weijie, the chief technician (chief engineer) of the factory (he is the younger brother of the female writer Bing Xin, studied chemical engineering in the United States, and has been with Yongli for 19 years), led us on a tour while explaining.</p>
<p>The first part is the gas plant. Air, steam, and coke are used to produce hydrogen and nitrogen, as well as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The gas produced here is called crude gas, and it is introduced into</p>
<p>The second part, the oxidation section, where most of the unstable carbon monoxide is converted into carbon dioxide, and then sent to</p>
<p>The third part, the refining section, where carbon dioxide and a small amount of carbon monoxide are washed away with water, and the pure oxygen-nitrogen gas is sent to</p>
<p>The fourth part, the high-pressure section, where it is directly synthesized into liquid ammonia through high pressure and the action of a catalyst, maintaining a suitable temperature, and then transported to a storage tank for ready use.</p>
<p>The fifth part, the sulfuric acid section, where pure sulfuric acid is produced from iron sulfide ore using the contact method and transported to</p>
<p>The sixth part, the ammonium sulfate section, where ammonia and sulfuric acid are neutralized in the channel to form white, uniform crystalline ammonium sulfate, dried, and packaged to become high-quality fertilizer.</p>
<p>Raw Material Coke is Urgently Needed</p>
<p>Among the raw materials for production, coke is currently the most problematic. The gas plant's record book lists the types of carbon used, including those from Pingxiang, Jiangxi; Tianfu, Sichuan; Zhongxing, Xuzhou; and even those from Taiwan, Canada, and Australia. The iron sulfide used to produce sulfuric acid is supplied by the Ma'anshan Mine of the National Resources Commission, which is located nearby, so there is no need to worry about a shortage. Furthermore, there is the issue of power. Until now, it still relies on the Capital Power Plant. Starting from October 19th last year, due to the damage to the cable across the river, work was suspended for more than three months.</p>
<p>Production Volume Increases Monthly</p>
<p>According to Chief Technician Xie, the average daily output of the Ammonia Plant in February was: 29.5 tons of synthetic liquid ammonia, 103 tons of sulfuric acid, and 114.5 tons of ammonium sulfate. However, workers pointed out that the daily output of each department was: more than 40 tons of synthetic liquid ammonia, more than 130 tons of sulfuric acid, and more than 140 tons of ammonium sulfate. The reporter saw in the record book of the sixth part, the ammonium sulfate section, that the output of ammonium sulfate on March 5th was 142.3 tons. In any case, the production volume of the Ammonia Plant is increasing. Chief Technician Xie is very grateful to UNRRA for its help to Yongli. At the beginning of the Yongli Ammonia Plant's restoration, UNRRA sent two experts to Xiejia Dian to conduct a detailed investigation, and decided to not only help restore the previous scale, but also find ways to increase equipment to increase production to three times the pre-war level, or 450 tons per day. The machinery supplied by UNRRA is worth approximately US$1 million, which Yongli will repay to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry with ammonium sulfate over six years.</p>
<p>Two-and-a-Half-Year Expansion Plan</p>
<p>We saw new foundations being laid near the factory buildings, and cranes on the riverbank were lifting timber, bricks, and tiles ashore. In the ironworks, various iron frames and huge boilers were being processed and sand-cast. In the research room and design department, many calm minds were at work. Chief Technician Xie said, "Our expansion plan can be fully completed in two and a half years. Daily production may reach 480 tons." However, even if we calculate it at 500 tons a day, the annual output is still less than 200,000 tons, while Taiwan alone needs 300,000 tons a year. What about Central and Southern China? Chief Technician Xie said that Yongli hopes to expand production by 30 times or even 50 times.</p>
<p>Hou Debang's Ten Years of Effort</p>
<p>Yongli Chemical Company was founded single-handedly by Mr. Fan Xudong, but after Mr. Fan's unfortunate death, he left no inheritance. Mrs. Fan is living in a friend's house in Shanghai. Mr. Hou Debang, who inherited Mr. Fan's legacy, and all the staff of Yongli have not become rich either. Mr. Hou spent ten years researching the alkali production method, striking a blow to the monopoly of the Solvay Group, and making a name for himself in the world. India and Brazil have successively invited him to help improve the alkali production industry, but the foreign exchange remuneration he received has never gone into his own pocket, but has been used to purchase equipment for Yongli. The employees of Yongli are all willing to accept the considerable remuneration given by the factory and live and work diligently.</p>
<p>However, in recent times, the workers have more or less felt that the factory's welfare work is not enough. Although their lowest monthly salary has risen from 15 yuan before the war to more than 20 yuan, the high prices have inevitably put some pressure on their lives. They have appealed to the public for sympathy in Nanjing newspapers more than once, and on January 26th of this year, they were approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Social Affairs to organize an industrial union to fight for their own welfare. However, they still uphold the principle of "business first" and will continue Mr. Fan's ambition to jointly seek industrial development.</p>
<p>Striving to Think for Employees</p>
<p>The factory has a very objective view of the trade union. It believes that the legitimate establishment of this organization can enable the factory to accurately understand the needs of workers' welfare, make improvements, and further enhance work efficiency. The factory acknowledges that there are not enough workers' dormitories, workers' treatment is not high enough, and it also admits that the current production situation has a surplus. However, it also points out that the surplus is not for making money during the accelerated implementation of the expansion plan, and the large number of workers and the difficulty in buying building materials are also difficulties. However, in any case, the factory is always trying its best to think for the employees. The fact that Yongli has never had a strike or other tricks is the most powerful proof.</p>
<p>Installing an Electric Fence to Consolidate the Stronghold</p>
<p>The Ammonia Plant is surrounded by high walls with electric fences installed on top. The security force is also quite strong. In the past few days, when Liuhe was disturbed, the Xiejia Dian factory was still safe. Now, the organization of the trade union has further linked the workers spiritually. This stronghold of national industry will be incomparably strong. The nitric acid equipment looted by the Japanese will soon be shipped back from Osaka. At that time, in addition to fertilizer for enriching the country, Yongli will also supply explosives for strengthening the country. But we still cannot help but hope that the TNT products of the Ammonia Plant will be best used in the construction of YVA. (Our reporter Pu Dejie)</p>
<h3>Suzhou High Procuratorate Continues to Issue Arrest Warrants for Puppet County Magistrate Li Tingzhang, etc.</h3>

<h3>Ten Strong Young Men in Jiangyin Attempt to Evade Military Service, Voluntarily Prepare Meals and Pretend to be Police Officers</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 9th] Since Director Zhang took office as the head of the county police bureau, Cheng Ruwen, a native of Jiaoxi, was appointed as the head of the Shengang Branch Bureau. Recently, for the conscription of soldiers, ten young men of conscription age in Guanshan Township, including Shen Yanghua, Xu Shengfeng, Xu Yinhan, Wang Yude, and Wang Yuceng, hoping to evade service, voluntarily prepared meals and served as police officers in the branch bureau. Out of local sentiment, Branch Bureau Chief Cheng dismissed ten original police chiefs and officers, including Zhang Huanbao, Zhou Xijun, and Jiang Rong, without reason. In order to protect their positions, the dismissed chiefs and officers filed a complaint with the county for relief, and at the same time reported that Branch Bureau Chief Cheng had seized more than 30 million in funds in Dongwei Yard and other places without reporting to the General Bureau, and also charged 6 million per month from the teahouses opened by Zhang Zuhong and five other families in Shengang, guaranteeing gambling and other activities. On the 8th, after receiving the report, Director Zhang sent Inspector Dong Mingzhang to the township to thoroughly investigate. The above facts were all denied, and it was said that they were all caused by the resentment of the dismissed police officers. The District Court Procuratorate has ordered ten dismissed chiefs and officers to be summoned to investigate the truth about Branch Bureau Chief Cheng's corruption and handle it according to law.</p>

Guo Xuenan and Zhang Daosheng, the new town chiefs of the Dalu Town in the district, attended and deliberated. After the meeting, around 5 p.m., the two town chiefs took a small dirt cart back to the Dalu line. Near Hongshan Mountain, they were kidnapped by six unidentified plainclothes bandits equipped with short guns. The driver was frightened and ordered to flee back to Dalu Town to report the incident to the town office. After the office contacted the district, they immediately reported to the Changjiang Defense Command to send a team to suppress the bandits, and also telegraphed the troops stationed in Picheng to clear and search to the east and west. The Jiangfang troops and the Xin Feng and Dagang guard forces of the county were all dispatched that night, and sealed off the main roads, but the search was unsuccessful. On the afternoon of the 6th, according to a report from the villagers, a flock of crows was found pecking at a corpse in the Wangxiangli pond in Dongxiang. It turned out that the bandits had strangled Guo Xuenan with a rope, then torn open his stomach, replaced the intestines with stone, and threw the body into the bottom of the pond. Zhang Hengdao's life and death are still unknown. The county government has ordered a strict arrest of the murderers in order to bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Tangshan Institute Rectifies Academic Atmosphere, Registration is Serious, Many Students are Expelled</h3>
<p>[Our Tangshan Dispatch] Tangshan Institute of Technology officially started classes on March 1st. Starting this semester, the school has made the greatest determination to rectify the academic atmosphere. Since the restoration, due to manpower and financial resources, all administrative measures have not met the ideals of the students. Therefore, there are often announcements on the democratic wall attacking the school and exposing the misconduct of the staff in the Academic Affairs Office. After the end of the last semester, there were even major wall newspaper attacks on the school's various unreasonable actions, which attracted the school's attention. Therefore, the school affairs meeting decided on a method to rectify the academic atmosphere. When students registered, the president personally supervised the Academic Affairs Office to prevent illegal cheating. Twenty-nine students who failed more than half of the selected credits were ordered to withdraw. Starting next academic year, auditors will not be accepted. Students who are on leave of absence will not be allowed to select credits, and professors will not have the right to promise to retain credits. The Office of Student Affairs made three rules to control student speech. In the future, wall newspaper groups must first register with the Office of Student Affairs. Students must not post announcements attacking the school and faculty. Anyone can tear off unsigned announcements. This matter has caused surprise among students, but so far there has been no reaction.</p>
<p>Starting this semester, the electrical engineering laboratory and the hydraulic laboratory have been opened. The materials testing laboratory, which was famous throughout the country before the war, is now just an empty house and cannot be restored to its former glory in the short term. Other experimental equipment such as physics, chemistry, and metallurgy have been slightly scaled. However, due to tight funding and expensive chemical prices, the number of student experiments has been reduced to save money.</p>

In recent days, more than 40 private middle school students, including Kong Qingquan, have collectively requested the Ministry of Education to: (1) Order various provincial middle schools to recruit more transfer students and relax the deadline for admission procedures, (2) Transfer orders to various private schools to issue transfer certificates; at the same time, the parents of various students have also protested and plan to petition Chairman Wang in the coming days.</p>

The Screening Committee has decided to request the Ministry of Education to give students who are not recognized the opportunity to take a screening test.

<h3>Braille Duplicating Machine Commissioned by the Royal National Institute for the Blind</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 10th] A Braille duplicating machine commissioned by the Royal National Institute for the Blind in England has been successfully produced. This machine has a space bar and six keys, each controlling a chisel. It is powered by electricity and can engrave Braille dots on both halves of a folded zinc plate. When paper is pressed tightly between the two halves of the zinc plate, Braille dots are printed on both sides, with the dots on each half "interlocking" so that the dots on one side do not interfere with the dots on the other side. It can print seventy sheets per minute. The Technical Research Committee of the "Royal National Institute for the Blind" has also invented a Braille drawing machine. A needle traces the image to be copied, and the same path is engraved as raised dots on the zinc plate.

<h3>Price Review Committee to Be Established Soon; To Proceed with Purchasing Export Materials; Representatives from Four Units of the Transportation Control Commission Have Been Designated</h3>
<p>In order to promote the export of materials, the Transportation Control Commission (TCC) formulated a plan, which was discussed by the National Economic Council and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It has now entered the implementation stage. All purchasing matters will be handled by the Price Review Committee for Purchasing Export Materials, which will be jointly organized by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, the Four Joint Offices, the Central Bank, the Central Trust of China (CTC), and the TCC, with each agency sending one representative. The TCC will preside over the committee, and the CTC and TCC will jointly be responsible for convening meetings. Representatives from the Four Joint Offices, the Central Bank, the CTC, and the TCC have been designated. The representative from the Four Joint Offices is Diao Minren, Deputy Director of the Four Joint Offices Branch; the representative from the Central Bank is Shao Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau; the representative from the CTC is He Molin, Deputy Director; and the representative from the TCC is Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Division. The committee will be formally established and begin purchasing once representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Ministry of Agriculture are designated. The purchase prices will be determined by the review committee. The CTC will only be responsible for executing the purchase, receiving payments, and making payments. The Ministry of Audit will send a representative to attend the meetings due to the national treasury payment relationship to audit the payment accounts.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the TCC: In order to strengthen exports in the future, purchasing and foreign exchange adjustment measures will be implemented simultaneously. When the foreign exchange rate cannot promote the export of materials under certain conditions at certain times, the purchasing method will be adopted to maintain the principle of foreign and domestic prices. The purchase price will be determined based on domestic and foreign market conditions. If exporters of export materials can export on their own, they will not be forced to sell to the government. If they cannot export on their own, they can apply for government purchase. After the purchase, the exporters will still be entrusted to handle the sales, and a reasonable handling fee will be given. After obtaining a foreign letter of credit on the export date, they can settle the exchange with the CTC, and the CTC will pay the national currency at the current exchange rate. It can be seen that this measure is not a unified purchase and sales, but is entirely for supporting exporters and promoting exports. The exporter's funds will not be frozen as in the past, and they will be able to obtain sufficient capital for use. This method has been effectively implemented by the government, and domestic and foreign prices can indeed be maintained. Taking tung oil as an example, at the beginning of the war, the price of American tung oil was $0.389 per pound. After the victory, it fell to $0.20. American tung oil farmers said that this was due to our dumping. In order to save the export crisis, we specifically implemented purchasing, and the American price rose from $0.20 to $0.24525. The export price after our purchase was set at $0.25 at the time. If the American price could not be sold at this price, it would not be exported. This price stabilized for a considerable period of time. After we stopped purchasing, the American price fell to $0.212. American oil farmers again requested the government to increase import taxes and raise the price to $0.30. In order to meet domestic and foreign needs, we set it at $0.24 and 1/8. In the future, we should still shift according to foreign conditions.</p>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of foreign exchange, the person in charge of the TCC also provided an explanation. It is said that the official exchange rate and the black market have long been decoupled. The official exchange rate is determined according to the price of export materials. When the percentage of the price of export materials to foreign prices is exceeded, the official exchange rate will be adjusted according to the percentage. After this foreign exchange adjustment, tung oil has been able to be exported. Based on $0.24 per pound, it is estimated that each dan is worth $320. Converted at an exchange rate of 195,000, it is 6 million. The current market price is only 6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice and Flour Initially Rose Then Fell; Oil Market Encouraged, All Saw Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market initially rose and then fell. The opening market followed the previous day's rising trend and the impact of the sharp rise in other commodity prices, and the prices of various types of rice rose significantly. White japonica rice opened at 3.85 million, thin indica rice at 3.8 million, and Wuhu indica rice at 3.42 million, all about 250,000 higher than the previous day. However, due to tight credit in the middle of the day, holders needed cash and sought to sell, and sales of household rice were sluggish, so sales became even more sluggish, and the market fell back later. White japonica rice retreated to 3.75 million, and thin indica rice also retreated to 3.75 million, up 150,000 from the previous day. In the northern city market, white japonica rice was 3.75 million, and thin indica rice, etc., rose by about 50,000 to 100,000. The total arrivals yesterday in the eleven city markets were 8,504 shi.</p>
<p>Flour: The early market took the opportunity to raise prices due to the sharp rise in rice prices. Bingchuan flour was 1.48 million yuan, Lao Che flour was 1.49 million yuan, and Hongfeng, Jiancheng, etc., rose by 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, as credit tightened, holders had to sell to obtain cash, and the supply became abundant for a time, so the market fell due to oversupply. In addition, the rise in rice prices turned into a fall, and confidence became even more depressed. Bingchuan closed at 1.47 million and Lao Che closed at 1.48 million, both delivered prices. Bran was weak because the factories opened more.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Follow the changes in this city. The price of soybeans rose by 100,000 yuan at the opening. In the middle of the day, the Qingdao gang purchased, and the market for Hankou soybeans was more bullish. The highest price of Hankou Zha soybeans reached 1.85 million, but customer appetite did not continue, and the closing price returned to 1.8 million, still 50,000 to 100,000 higher than the previous day. The Guang gang of raw peanuts also purchased slightly, rising by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Initially rose and then fell slightly. At the opening, people were encouraged by the sharp rise in rice prices. In addition, the prices in Wuxi were high, so the holders had very firm thoughts. Soybean oil rushed out of 7 million at the opening. Da You and Da Tong soybean oil was 7.05 million. The closing market turned sluggish due to tight credit and small rice prices. Soybean cake initially went out of 800,000, and the closing price was only a few thousand yuan higher than the previous day.</p>

Hong Kong Electric experienced a severe contraction, making it difficult to recover after reaching a high point. Rubber stocks continued to soar. Jardine Silk opened in the morning and quickly broke through the 1.6 million yuan barrier, approaching the 1.7 million yuan level before slightly stabilizing.

D-grade varieties were bid up to around 85 million, while high-grade odd-lot silk was bid at 80 million. High-grade odd-lot dry silk was quoted at around 240 million.</p>
<p>The silk goods market was weak yesterday. Due to the decline in raw materials the previous evening, market sentiment was inevitably soft.

Fourteen stocks reached their daily limit, and many familiar stocks reached new records. Distribution of compensation materials focused stockholders on Zhabei and American Asia, further boosting those two stocks.</p>

<h3>Financial Administration Bureau Randomly Inspects Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau launched another large-scale inspection during the period from the end of the lunar year to the recent dramatic price fluctuations. Twenty to thirty banks and firms were randomly inspected. The key points of the inspection were: (1) The cash position of each bank and firm, (2) The situation of bounced checks, (3) The situation of bill collateral, (4) The situation of warehouses, (5) The situation of loan collection.</p>
<p>The inspection has now been fully reviewed, and the results show that the operations of the inspected banks and firms are generally normal. However, a small number of banks and firms have either made too many loans that cannot be recovered on time, resulting in improper cash positions, or have overdrawn or collateralized excessively, resulting in bounced checks. The Financial Administration Bureau has strictly ordered all banks and firms to rectify the situation separately. It is reported that all banks and firms have complied with the orders.</p>
<h3>Floating Capital from Outside Flows into the Market, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Rise Again and Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a positive outlook in the morning. Merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions continued to buy, and local manufacturers followed suit. Fine yarns saw tight supplies, and both local and out-of-town buyers were actively purchasing. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn continued to rise by 6 million yuan, reaching a new high of 168 million yuan at the close. Throughout the day, 21-count Eagle Horse, despite being boosted by platform traders, reached a new peak of 96 million. However, due to continued tight credit, floating sellers took profits, and it eventually closed at 93 million. Warehouse receipts were at 91 million, down 2 million. 16-count coarse yarn continued to rise by 2-3 million, driven by continued buying from weaving manufacturers. 20-count yarn and 32-count, as well as other coarse and fine yarns, saw increases and decreases of 100,000 to 3 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially saw a stable sentiment due to news of strengthened US aid. Many floating sellers booked profits, and the market briefly declined. However, it was then reported that floating capital from North China had gathered in Shanghai and flowed into the cotton cloth market. Merchants from Hankou, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Shanxi competed to buy aggressively, and industry insiders also made significant purchases. Additionally, scattered retail investors joined the rally, and buying sentiment spread, causing prices to continue jumping to new highs. In the end, 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloths reached new highs, rising by 150,000 to 170,000 yuan. Other fabrics such as serge, straight tribute silk, bleached cloth, colored cloth, shirting, and pongee also rose, ranging from 120,000 to 340,000 yuan, and the market atmosphere was very firm.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the recent surge in cotton cloth prices is entirely due to the actions of floating capital from outside. However, local sales are mediocre, and business at cloth shops is not very lively. Actual sales in other regions remain sluggish, and the market is in a precarious situation. Dyeing factories also have limited sales volume and are making minimal purchases. If prices continue to rise unabated, the public may face difficulties in obtaining clothing.</p>

<h3>Industrial Oils Firm and Buoyant</h3>
<p>The industrial oil market is firm and buoyant due to strong demand from candle and soap manufacturers. Beef tallow and asphalt are the most actively purchased, and prices have risen accordingly.

<p>Cigarettes Rise Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw prices rise further as manufacturers were expected to adjust prices again due to higher raw material costs resulting from the rise in the US dollar exchange rate. Concerns about delayed deliveries also fueled positive sentiment and strengthened buying interest. The prices of various cigarettes continued to rise. Finally, ten packs of British Old Knife cigarettes rose by 4 million and 4.5 million yuan respectively compared to the previous day. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose uniformly by 10,000 to 340,000 yuan.

Large buyers actively purchased, and industry insiders also actively covered their positions. Fueled by joint purchases from the Yue-er gang and other groups, the market saw a flurry of buying activity, and prices soared. As a result, Gu Ben and Arrow soaps rose again by 280,000 and 310,000 yuan respectively. In addition, Hsiang Mao, Kwong Wah, Mei Li, etc., also rose by varying amounts of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Dynamics of Social Culture</h3>
<p>— Traditional First</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Dynamic</p>
<p>P.A. Sorokin, American Book Co. Vol. I-III 1937 Vol. IV 1941</p>
<p>I often wonder why, no matter what we Chinese do, we can't seem to do it well. Any good system, good plan, or good material will gradually deteriorate, and become unimaginably bad. The current political corruption, economic poverty, social decadence, educational bankruptcy... what are the reasons for all this? Some blame the greed and incompetence of certain individuals, while others blame the warmongering of certain individuals, but I believe that neither of these is the case. In my opinion, the current chaos in China is a natural phenomenon resulting from the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures. There is a Western saying, "Old wine in new bottles." I believe that China's current situation is "New bottles containing old wine." Don't be fooled by the beautiful bottles of Three-Star Brandy, inside is aged Shaoxing Huadiao wine. Therefore, in politics, economics, society, and education, whether it be organizational structures, personnel management, or plans and programs, they are all transplanted from Western culture. However, our lifestyle, attitude towards life, and worldly wisdom are all still within the scope of the Chinese cultural tradition. Therefore, I believe that the solution to China's problems lies in the process of cultural exchange between East and West.</p>
<p>Sorokin is a scholar who seeks a way out for Western culture. His works can be used as a reference for our study of cultural exchange between East and West. I previously introduced his book "The Crisis of Our Age" in this journal, which was highly valued by the general public. His other works include "Contemporary Sociological Theories" (translated by Huang Wenshan, Commercial Press) and "Social and Cultural Dynamics" (translated by Zhong Zhaolin, World Press). The author's erudition is truly astonishing. The literature he cites includes Russian, French, German, and Italian sources, not to mention English and American ones. The book to be studied in this article includes four volumes:</p>
<p>Volume 1: On the Changes in Artistic Forms, 770 pages</p>
<p>Volume 2: On the Changes in Philosophy, Ethics, and Law, 727 pages</p>
<p>Volume 3: On the Changes in Social Relations, War, and Revolution, 636 pages</p>
<p>Volume 4: On the Fundamental Problems, Principles, and Methods of Social Dynamics, 804 pages</p>
<p>The author says that his social thought was originally influenced by the trends of thought in the early 20th century. He believed in social progress, revolution, socialism and democracy, and scientific positivism. He says: "For better or for worse, I have fought for these values; therefore, I have also paid a considerable price. I hope for peaceful progress and not war; I hope for bloodless social reform and not bloody revolution; I hope for a more noble humanism and not collective suicide; I hope for better democracy and not oligarchical dictatorship; I hope for scientific improvement and not false propaganda; I hope for the multifaceted improvement of mankind and not a return to barbarism. But the First World War gave this concept the first ruthless blow. The Soviet Revolution was the second big blow. If someone in 1913 had made an affirmative prediction of even the smallest part of what is happening now, he would have been immediately regarded as a madman at the time. But many, many things that seemed absolutely impossible continue to happen."</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Due to what cause? The author began to wander, and then searched for materials to find the root. Finally, in the tide of world culture, he found a clue? This book is the crystallization of his years of exploration. The first question he wants to solve is "Is the flow of culture circular and repetitive, or is it infinitely creative?" His answer is: First, the dynamic force of culture is a creative repetitive style. The process of historical culture does not always progress in a straight line, and there are often novel changes. However, in these changes, there is still a repetition of old components, but they are repeated in many small units more successfully. Second, he believes that the development process of various cultures has a limit. That is to say, a certain culture has a period of time in which it moves in a certain direction without any significant change, but when it reaches its limit, it will immediately flow downstream and move in another new direction. (He calls this the "principle of limits," see Chapter 14 of Volume 4). Third, the reason for this change is not necessarily due to external causes, but because its internal forces have reached a stage where change is inevitable. (He calls this the "principle of internal cause," see Chapter 12 of Volume 4).</p>
<p>He believes that various cultures always revert to one of the three forms: (a) Ideational, (b) Idealistic, and (c) Sensate. In the Ideational cultural form, people transcend experience, pursue spiritual values, and practice self-control. In the Sensate cultural form, people indulge in desires and seek material enjoyment. The Idealistic cultural form takes the middle path between the two, combining emotion and reason. He points out that Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism belong to the Ideational type of culture; Epicurus, Caesar, Lenin, and modern Western culture belong to the Sensate type; and Confucius' doctrine of the mean belongs to the Idealistic type.</p>
<p>The author's research method combines the method of logical meaning and the method of causal function, that is, the combined use of induction and deduction. He says: "Purely collecting facts without thought cannot lead to meaningful conclusions; purely logical reasoning without facts will inevitably lead to a feeling of emptiness and unreality." The theory stated above is, on the one hand, a hypothesis proposed by the author based on facts, and on the other hand, he has confirmed this hypothesis from many cultural histories. Therefore, this theory is not a fanciful creation but has its factual basis.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the first volume of this book, the author made a systematic and comprehensive study of Western painting, sculpture, music, architecture, and literature from the primitive era, through Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance, all the way to the modern era. He statistically analyzed the works of each era to see their development trends. The second volume is divided into two parts: the first part is the study of the development of various knowledge systems in various eras, which is the so-called "sociology of knowledge." He traces the evolution of idealism and materialism; the evolution of eternalism and temporalism; the evolution of realism and nominalism; the evolution of determinism and indeterminism; the evolution of all physical, biological, and other scientific theories; and the evolution of categories such as causality, time and space, and number. He uses detailed numerical figures to explain the waxing and waning of various schools of thought over the years. The second part is the study of the changes in ethics and law in various eras. He also found the same route in it. They are all either wavy reversions in the Sensate, Ideational, and Idealistic cultural types. The third volume is divided into four parts: (1) the form and changes of social relations, including various political, economic, religious, and social groups and organizations; (2) the changes in the history of war between various groups; (3) internal disturbances and collapses within various group organizations; (4) the relationship between personality types and social types.</p>
<p>Based on the results of his research on the development of Western culture in various aspects, he believes that Western culture was in the Ideational stage in the Middle Ages, and has entered the Sensate stage in modern times. Currently, it is the period when Sensate culture has developed to the point of near decline. The author has the following conclusions regarding the future development trends of Western culture:</p>
<p>(1) Material values ​​will be more relative and fragmented. In the future, truth and falsehood, right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, positive and negative will all be confused. There will be a state of anarchy in psychology, morality, society, and aesthetics.</p>
<p>(2) Everything is progressing, but it is the progress of destruction, not the progress of construction. Whether it is human beings or all values, they are regarded as physical and chemical effects, reflective effects, economic effects, or mechanical effects. This universe is just a world of atoms and electrons.</p>
<p>(3) The so-called public opinion and conscience will disappear. Everything will be full of conflicting opinions.</p>
<p>(4) Force and fraud have become the means to obtain everything. As a result, there is only universal war, revolution, rebellion, and disturbance. People fight with people, and countries fight with countries.</p>
<p>(5) Freedom has become the mantra of oppressors.</p>
<p>(6) The government is becoming increasingly corrupt, deceptive, and tyrannical, using guns instead of bread; death instead of freedom; violence instead of law; and destruction instead of construction.</p>
<p>(7) The family is no longer a sacred union between husband and wife, but has become a hostel for the union of men and women. Divorce will gradually increase.</p>
<p>(8) Vitality and creativity will continue to decline. There will be no more Newtons, Darwins, or Beethovens, but some mediocre thinkers, film manufacturers, and music brokers.</p>
<p>(9) Life safety will be threatened, and suicide, mental illness, and crime will increase. Everyone will feel depressed.</p>
<p>(10) The general public will be divided into two factions: one faction will be the hedonists who "drink today and be drunk today"; the other faction will be hermits who practice asceticism and do not seek fame or fortune.</p>
<p>The future trend is that Sensate culture will age and pass away, while Idealistic or Ideational culture will generate new vitality and unleash new creativity, forming a new spiritual culture.</p>
<p>The current level of chaos in China seems to be beyond repair. China is undergoing tremendous changes. This is a metamorphosis. All corrupt, stubborn, violent, and crazy elements will be shed, and a new life, a new form of culture with its new creativity, is about to come.</p>
<h3>The Art of Living</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fang</p>
<p>"Kaicheng Youth Series" by Cao Fu</p>
<p>The Russian blind poet Eroshchenko said: "What we sow in spring, we can reap at harvest time. All the year's good fortune depends on our spring work, and the roots of famine, lack, and all other misfortunes of a country also grow in spring." Youth is truly like the spring of life, so we too should sow good seeds during our youth.</p>
<p>Moreover, youth is the easiest time to feel depressed, troubled, and sad. To remedy these problems and sow good seeds; this is the cultivation of youth.</p>
<p>The book "The Art of Living" discusses many problems of youth cultivation, and there are two points in it that deserve our attention: First, it does not emphasize the external refinement of youth. Second, it points youths in broad directions, not just treating the head when it hurts or the foot when it hurts.</p>
<p>This book has eleven articles. The first article, "The Confession of an Idealist," is where the author introduces his own life philosophy. In the second article, "Life and Interest," the author proposes three conditions to guide young people: (1) Persistence - he quotes Liang Rengong's words: "If doing something does not produce results that are related to interest, then this thing can be the subject of interest."</p>
<p>(2) Comprehensiveness - he says: An interest that rejects other equally good or better interests is not a good interest. Conversely, an interest that can induce other equally good or better interests is a good interest. (3) Rationality - he believes that there must be thought and ideals in interest. Some interests, such as gambling and drinking, cannot withstand thinking, so they cannot be interests, at most only low-level interests. The third article is "Planning Life." He quotes the four sentences of the Song Dynasty Confucian Zhang Zai as the best explanation of the highest level of life plan: "Establish a heart for the world, plead for the lives of the people, continue the unique learning for past sages, and create peace for all ages." That is to say, the highest level of life plan is to combine personal plans with the mission of history and the requirements of the times.</p>
<p>The following four articles are "Work", "Play", "Reading", and "Love". Perhaps these are the four issues that young people are most concerned about. The last one is "Anti-Cynicism", "Hero and Hero Worship", "Group and Self", in addition to two prefaces, which are also beneficial to the cultivation of young people. Especially the one on what young people should cultivate.</p>
<p>In short, this is a healthy book on the cultivation of youth.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of English Word Origins</h3>
<p>— Wen Ni</p>
<p>Published by Liu Junwei, Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>Studying language is the most boring, it is not more vivid and practical than other sciences. The reason is that words are dead, and can only represent a symbol of a language oath, no wonder it is boring.</p>
<p>Learning English is often a pain for readers, the differences between China and foreign countries are one thing, the biggest reason lies in single words, and single words are extremely abstract, making it difficult to remember. It is said that there are more than 100,000 British single words, although it is not necessary to remember them all, it is still a painful thing. Often, scholars give up halfway. In fact, English single words, in addition to their own Celtic language, also contain Latin, Greek and other language families, so they are extremely complex; coupled with the derivation of prefixes and suffixes, they become even more complex. To study English and understand its word origins is very necessary, as it is said in the introduction of the book, "..., according to , you can know its , divide and combine, and have a clear view at a glance. By analogy, you can remember what you already know and extend it to what you don't know, ...", and it is also said in the preface: "The function of word origins is not only to detail the source of a word and its changes when it is linked to other words, but also to further explain its structure and the progress of its script ..."</p>
<p>There are still few books on foreign language origins in our country. This book describes four parts:</p>
<p>(1) Outline of single-word composition: A very concise statement of the types and structures of single words is made, with examples given.</p>
<p>(2) The phenomenon of prefix combination.</p>
<p>(3) The phenomenon of suffix combination.</p>
<p>(4) Word root plate. The above three parts make simple explanations of each prefix, suffix, and root, and attach sufficient examples to show its effect, and the attached examples are also very common and practical. Although it is only a booklet of more than one hundred and fifty pages, it is a good reference book for those who study English, and it is also suitable as leisure reading during the winter vacation. I would like to introduce it for enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Arch of Triumph"</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Author: Remarque Translator: Zhu Wen Publisher: Cultural Life Publishing House</p>
<p>A German refugee meets a heartbroken woman on a long street near the Seine River and the Alma Bridge in the black night of November in Paris. This is how the story of "Arch of Triumph" begins:</p>
<p>Like countless anti-Nazi exiles, Ravic has no real name, no passport, and no ID. Everything seems "illegal". He is the "backstage doctor" of a famous Parisian doctor, a "ghost surgeon" who performs operations. Of course, such a profession is secret. He lives in a "tomb" like hotel, with no so-called "home." A loner's loneliness is naturally easily dispelled in Paris. Love a woman casually, discard her casually. It doesn't matter. Ravic spends his days like this, indifferently, in exile in a foreign country. His joys and sorrows, happiness and imprisonment, cries and laughs ... it doesn't matter; but - Joan Madou, the strange woman who met by chance at the Alma Bridge, that woman, one person among the countless humans, her face, one face among countless faces, her eyes, one pair among millions of eyes ... it wasn't love at first sight. But Ravic tried to forget her several times, but couldn't forget her. This lovely and hateful gypsy-type woman, he didn't fall in love with her at first sight, but she broke into his life, even into his very existence. Ravic privately didn't want to admit it, but couldn't deny it.</p>
<p>Without an ID, you have nothing. But now he has Joan Madou: he takes care of her man's funeral, he finds her a job singing in a nightclub, he helps her a lot. But Joan needs more from him. She wants a clean little apartment, a clean little refuge, the warmth that belongs to two people. But he can't, he has no reason to rent an apartment, nor can he marry the woman he loves, because he has no ID. So they can only leave Paris for a short time and go to Antibes for a few days. The turquoise bay of Antibes and the golden sun add beauty to the days. These few days are full of light and love, but all this happiness has no roots. Happiness in the clouds, a good dream in the clouds, back to Paris, the dream also wakes up.</p>
<p>Later, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, shouldn't the gunpowder smell in Paris be stronger? But Paris is still Paris, corruption and prosperity, everything is as before, the same as when he left, only one thing is different: - Joan Madou left the nightclub and lived with a movie actor. Only this one thing is different from before, a very small thing, but how different it is.</p>
<p>Like every estranged lover, between them, after many explanations, forgiveness, questioning, tolerance ... love and quarrel, quarrel and love, bad and good, good and bad, finally they are still connected. That is the most difficult thread to break since ancient times, love.</p>
<p>Many refugees are looking for other ways out, many friends have left Paris, because war is about to happen, but Ravic doesn't consider other plans. Now, he has avenged himself, the person he hated has died at his own hands, why doesn't he leave? Now, even the singing and dancing in Paris has become tense, Ravic, a single German refugee, what is he reluctant to give up?</p>
<p>One night, Ravic received a phone call from Joan, she begged him to come quickly, she needed him, but Ravic hung up the phone. Then, an unknown young man walked into his door, the movie actor, the one living with Joan, this person brought bad and terrible news: Joan was injured, he shot her himself, out of jealousy.</p>
<p>Ravic looked at his own hands, his hands, that had performed thousands of operations, saved countless lives, but now had become powerless. His hands, that had killed the person he hated the most, couldn't save the person he loved the most. - The person he loved the most, in the last moments of her life, she told him that she loved him, and he told her that he loved her, and then Joan died like that, although she was not willing to die.</p>
<p>Ravic was not sad, many dangers flashed before his eyes, faces and past events, and then the last unchanging face. The golden sunlight was moving, moving, these were the last few hours of his freedom, because France and Germany had declared war.</p>
<p>The truck passed through the Arc de Triomphe, Ravic and a large group of people were squeezed inside, he was sent from this "tomb" to another, worse "tomb" - a concentration camp, at that time, there were no lights everywhere, only pitch black. ...</p>
<p>The story ends like this, the endless book gives people a kind of pity, a kind of anger, a kind of horror, and a kind of thirst and expectation for freedom and light; this emotion, this idea, is in the hearts of thousands of readers, but few people can say it concretely. So many emotions, so many tastes of life, so many experiences of life, so much pain and joy of life, so much love, passionate love, love to the point of barbarism, so much hate, deep hate, hate to the point of madness; ... these burning traces, the reality of blood and tears, the poetry of this world, are not the empty and ethereal legends and dramas that come out of nowhere; this is the story of people, and it is also the story of the times, the story of the world; this is the elegy of people, and it is also the elegy of the times, the elegy of the world; because what is described here is not only the black night of mankind, but also the black night of the times, the black night of the world. After reading "Arc de Triomphe", we should not only cry for the characters in the story, but also shed tears for this world, this era.</p>
<p>There seems to be no need to introduce the author of this book again. When Remarque is mentioned, thousands of readers immediately think of "All Quiet on the Western Front", which was a recognized epoch-making masterpiece after the First World War. In the First World War, Remarque brought the most brilliant pearl to the world literary scene. The European and American critics unanimously believe that this "Arc de Triomphe" surpasses any of the author's past works, and has been filmed by the American film industry.</p>
<p>After the Nazis came to power, Remarque fled Germany and lived in the United States. This book was written in the United States, published in the United States, and translated in the United States. According to the records of the American Book Club, it has sold 20 million copies. In addition to this book and "All Quiet on the Western Front", the author also has "The Road Back", "Flotsan", and "Three Comrades", etc.; Cultural Life Publishing House has planned to publish "The Complete Works of Remarque", translated by Zhu Wen, the translator of this book. Another masterpiece of the author, "Floating Lotus" (Flotam), has been translated and will be printed soon.</p>

<h3>Philosophy of Mud</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>In the beginning, when God created man, it is said that the raw material used was mud. The mud comes from the earth, and the earth is the mother of mankind, and man's final destination is still to be thrown into the arms of this mother, and still turn into mud. Taking people's lives as an example, tracing back to the source, which one can leave the relationship with the earth. I remember when I was sick in a church hospital run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in a certain year, I saw a book on health and hygiene. The book advocates that people should eat more vegetables and less fish and meat, because pigs, sheep, cattle and horses mostly grow by eating grass. It is neither economical nor hygienic for people to use grass to feed pigs and sheep and then eat their meat. I am still very grateful for this simple truth, and I feel more and more the profound meaning of God's creation of man with mud. Even if this is a myth, it is quite interesting.</p>
<p>But perhaps some people think that mud is an unclean thing, and it would be too sloppy for God to use it to create man. For example, Jia Baoyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" once disliked men for being made of rotten mud, so they were unclean, and only women were made of clear water. Jia Baoyu naturally didn't know the story of God creating man. In fact, women are just a part of flesh and blood separated from men, and are also made of mud in essence. In my opinion, the myth of mud creating man has another profound meaning.</p>
<p>First, man comes from the earth, and finally returns to the earth, which shows the causal relationship of man, telling people not to forget the origin in the secular life. Not to mention that wealth and fame are like floating clouds, even in the process of life, everything in the undertaking should leave some leeway when it is time to stop, for one's own life, for future generations, for the society and country entrusted to my strange life. A person should fulfill his due responsibility, but between self and altruism, there should still be some leeway.</p>
<p>This opinion is not nihilism or escapism. If you can calmly observe the world, you will definitely be surprised and even sigh at the busy situation of the common people. What are those crowds on the road hurrying about? Is it for survival? However, not everyone is busy for life, I am afraid half of them are busy with nothing. Because on the asphalt road where there is not a single blade of green grass, it is difficult to believe that there is any real meaning of life.</p>
<p>The conditions of life cannot be separated from the basic conditions of food production. However, according to experts, China needs 380 million agricultural laborers to support the remaining 70 million people. Conversely, in the developed United States, only 32 million agricultural laborers are needed to supply food for 180 million people. Therefore, in theory, those who are truly busy with life should be the 380 million Chinese villagers rather than the 70 million city dwellers. But the actual situation seems to be the opposite. The rural areas in the interior are already sparsely populated, and there is a deep feeling of insufficient labor, while in cities like Shanghai, there is a surplus of labor.</p>
<p>The result of the surplus of urban labor is naturally unavoidable competition for survival. Thus, those who are superior engage in speculation, and those who are inferior engage in scalping, and everyone euphemistically calls it survival. However, what kind of survival are they seeking? They are only using various disguised fraudulent means to try to pour the money in your pocket into his pocket. Not only is there no production to speak of, it is really a great waste of manpower.</p>
<p>However, the problem is not limited to this. Those big and small scalpers actually pay attention to that so-called "entrepreneurial spirit." Not only are they not sloppy about the "money in and out," but they are also full of a terrible "competition" spirit towards people and things. Whether it is rushing onto a streetcar or competing to run in the market, it has reached the point where it is either you or me. Once I heard a ticket seller on a streetcar say to a passenger who was desperately rushing onto the car: "Don't rush so hard regardless of life and death. It doesn't matter if you wait a while. You will have more time if you can live twenty-four hours longer." However, now many people seem to have no time to consider their future twenty-four hours for the sake of the immediate competition.</p>
<p>I am not pessimistic, but the day of a seven-foot paulownia coffin and a cup of yellow earth will eventually come to everyone. People are just passing travelers in this world. It is naturally worthy of everyone to try to do something to benefit the people. Even if it is just for one's own sake, it cannot be said to be a sin. However, in the process of life, if you can often bring a few philosophical perspectives, then whether it is for yourself or for others, even if it is useless, it will never be harmful.</p>
<p>The so-called philosophy here does not have any profound principles, as long as you have the opportunity to go to the countryside to hold a handful of mud and play with it, it is all in it.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Dislike for Noise</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>When I was young, I read an article by Henry Van Dyke, titled "Silence." He had a famous saying: In this age, there is too much noise, we simply cannot "hear" our own thoughts anymore.</p>
<p>The "this age" that Van Dyke refers to is the end of the nineteenth century, which was a peaceful and prosperous world, and the business world was especially smooth and prosperous like never before. Advertising techniques also began to be used on a large scale, with posters and slogans everywhere. Thus, scholars who were accustomed to tranquility, such as Van Dyke, felt that the invisible high wall around him had been broken through by these new "civilizations," and issued a desperate appeal. However, the appeal was also in vain. Human ears are the most uncontrollable organs: we can close our eyes to things we don't want to see; but we cannot close our ears to sounds we don't want to hear. Comparing the past and the present, Van Dyke was still lucky to scare all the customers away and keep his shop. At least in his era, there was one kind of "civilization" that was not as powerful, universal, and persistent as it is now.</p>
<p>This one kind of "civilization" is the radio.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I worked in a high-rise building, and the office was along the road. Directly across the road was a newly opened second- or third-rate department store. The department store did not have a radio, but it installed a loudspeaker at the door, and every day from morning it roared with its only three records, until late at night. A friend once asked me: "Why do I always hear 'Hanging Heads on High Poles' every time I call you?" In addition to a bitter smile, I had to tell him that the boss across the street regarded the God of Wealth Festival as a terrible star.</p>
<p>Jin Shaoshan's Famen Temple may not be bad - although I believe his "airs" are definitely not as good as Hao Chouchen. But to play it so many times every day, I am afraid that even Jin Shaoshan himself would have to cry for mercy? Besides, it is a bit too humorous to use "Hanging Heads on High Poles" as a means of attracting customers!</p>
<p>This is of course just an extreme example. However, the trend of shops using radios to attract audiences has not changed to this day. Every time I walk down a road, in addition to the popping sounds of car horns rising and falling, there is this large area of ​​endless broadcast warfare - one shop is playing resonant Peking Opera, the next shop is playing sharp songs, and across the street may be a sad Shaoxing opera. Walking on the road already causes a headache, how dare you even go to those noisy places of origin - the shops - to buy things?</p>
<p>On careful thought, the reason why shops must have radios, and must turn them on so loud, may be a clever way for the shop assistants to be lazy. Aren't they free from work if they have people with especially strong hearts blocking the door for those who specialize in listening to the radio?</p>
<p>I don't want to criticize the quality of radio programs, and I certainly don't want to underestimate the contribution of radio. For example, hearing the broadcast of Du Shouyi's charity performance last year made me feel grateful for the radio. (But I still don't understand why no one recorded that charity performance; haven't they heard the Toscanini records from NBC?) What I want to point out is that everyone has different interests. Suppose I am a person who never wants to listen to Yue opera, and a certain shop just happens to play Yue opera programs all day long, then I will naturally never go into this shop. If the purpose of the shop was originally to attract customers, and I was originally prepared to go to this shop to buy things, but the transaction was not completed because of the radio, wouldn't it be a pity - it also costs a little electricity to turn on the radio. I think it is better to save this electricity and install more bright neon lights - it at least decorates some of the night scenes of this city.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teacher</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Schools are divided into large, medium, and small, so the names of those who hold the teaching whip are also different: professor, teacher, and instructor. Because teaching is the most difficult career, some people say: universities "teach sorrow," middle schools "teach resentment," and elementary schools "teach death." Regardless of whether it is sarcasm, the fact that elementary school teachers deserve sympathy is undeniable.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because my enlightenment teacher in elementary school was particularly poor that I always remembered him. Tall and thin, he had been mixed in with innocent children for decades, giving him a deep understanding of children's psychology, but also bringing him gradually white hair and an even more difficult life. After being separated from him for ten years, these ten years of war and turmoil, I learned from my sister that he was still teaching at his alma mater. According to my sister, Teacher Zhang is even thinner and has gray hair. Maybe this is the result of his ten years! He said that he was very happy to see me learning to write articles in the newspaper. His attention made me feel a sincere sense of guilt, because in the past few years, I had never taken the time to visit him once.</p>
<p>Because of this, I feel even more that elementary school teachers, in addition to not having any so-called material enjoyment, they also do not get any spiritual comfort. After elementary school students graduate and go to middle school and university, they have already put their elementary school teachers out of their minds and forgotten them completely. However, how uncomfortable is our teacher?</p>
<p>I often think to myself, there are so many students graduating every year, he probably won't recognize me! However, facts have proven my idea to be wrong: it was after our principal Zhu Shaoping was martyred in Manila, I wrote a short article in the newspaper to commemorate him. Although I used a pen name, he saw his student in the words. In a certain opportunity, he inquired about my sister and my recent situation. Obviously, he had not forgotten us children, just like a kind mother, she was watching the children she had nurtured!</p>
<p>Like the roots of an old tree, the flourishing branches and leaves are due to the supply of nutrients from the old roots, so that they can be verdant and full of eyes; no matter how high a towering building is, how can it stand without the support of the underground foundation?</p>
<p>I wrote this short article to pay tribute to my elementary school teacher and to wish him good health!</p>

<h3>Traces of Flying Saucers</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>Last summer, there was a long-standing fuss about flying saucers. They were discovered all over the world, and newspapers spread the news, causing unfounded fears and superstitious rumors. A friend of mine studying at Harvard University recently sent a letter reporting the truth, revealing that flying saucers are not some secret weapon, but simply this: The original letter is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Brother ××: Having not seen domestic newspapers for a long time, I eagerly sought to read them. Yesterday, I obtained a few copies from Mrs. Bi. Although they were old news, I found reports mentioning "the mystery of flying saucers, which has not yet been revealed." Here, it is no longer a mystery. Although newspapers have not sensationalized it or treated it as important news, they have revealed some details. If the mystery truly remains unsolved in China, I am willing to explain it in detail. It is merely a trick played by V2 rockets. When the rocket is launched from the ground (New Mexico), a precisely calculated automatic device explodes at an altitude of about one hundred miles in the sky. The steel fragments of the warhead then fly upwards at a speed of 25,000 miles per hour. During this upward flight, these fragments are attracted back to Earth by gravity, causing them to orbit irregularly, like scattered flowers shimmering in the sunlight, circular like saucers, until the inward pull of gravity causes them to fall back to Earth. This is because the outward force of motion gradually weakens against the inward pull of gravity.</p>
<p>The purpose of this experiment is to measure the density and temperature of the air in the upper atmosphere, to understand the true nature of the ionosphere, and to solve certain electrical problems and problems related to throwing objects beyond the Earth's gravitational pull. The issue that causes people in our country to be startled is nothing more than this. In addition to our university, the experiment is also being conducted at the California Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University, among others. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Casual Impressions</h3>
<p>— Bai Chu</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Chinese people do not pay much attention to impressions. We dare not casually criticize a new friend; partly because we are afraid that words spoken might spread and cause trouble, but mainly because we "have no basis for judgment." When we say someone is good or bad, we are merely expressing, based on accumulated observations up to now, our assessment of them—there is no element of impression in this, nor does it mean they are permanently good or bad. Isn't there a popular saying in society, "The coffin lid seals the final judgment"? This illustrates that we dare not draw conclusions until that person has passed away.</p>
<p>Why don't we value impressions? Why must we wait until the "coffin is sealed" before "drawing a conclusion"? This involves the issue of "face." Chinese people value face. If someone wants to get to know you, even if they are so poor they owe their landlord three months' rent, they will still get a haircut, take a bath, borrow a Western suit, and present themselves as a young master. Even if they are the most despicable and shameless rogue, they will pretend to be refined and gentle, engaging in affected conversation for a while. If you were to form a good impression based on this alone, and think they are a young master or gentleman, wouldn't that be a joke! Everyone understands this principle, so there is a tacit understanding: no one criticizes based on impression. Because impressions are unreliable, to make an accurate judgment, one must wait until the coffin is sealed and there is no room for change, otherwise, you might just say they are a human being, but their fox tail is already wagging behind them. Without a demon-revealing mirror, how would you know what kind of creature they transformed from?</p>
<p>However, the situation is very different in foreign countries. "First impression" is almost a common term and is taken very seriously. If this "first impression" is good, it is like being registered with the government; you are forever considered a good person. Even if you make a mistake occasionally, it is seen as understandable and forgiven. Conversely, if you give someone a very bad first impression, they will definitely "look at you differently" afterward. Even if you perform well, it will be considered an unexpected "miracle"!</p>
<p>One is "the coffin lid seals the final judgment," the other is "first impression." This shows the difference in attitudes toward people between Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Discussions from the Arts Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Mourning Mr. He Yangling's Past in Lake Pavilion Reminiscences</p>
<p>Knowing this gathering is transient again, I bear to say the He Lake grass is desolate, His career vanished like smoke, my emotions heavy, The Lake Pavilion wine scattered, the moon hazy! Two or three figures are silent paintings, In June, frost flew like last night, Raising my eyes, White Gate truly causes heartache, A coffin leaving regrets to depth.</p>
<p>Mourning Mr. Yangling Again</p>
<p>Stars flow at the corner of the roof, ink flows in traces, Just three months ago, we discussed White Gate, Heartbreaking for the country on this night, Thinking about it, what is there to say about fate? Once supported the precarious situation with streamlined troops, Always cherishing small loyalties, you were revered in your seat. Opening a government for eight years was originally a dream, Only leaving behind a reputation for integrity at the coffin lid.</p>
<p>Hungrily swallowing wheat cakes, going out without a carriage, Proclamations issued overnight, sitting in a cold office, Not necessarily ill-fated for resigning from office, Pitiable, letting go with a whole family! My life will see荒夢 again, Wild sacrifices fly in disorder, with a rustling sound. The remaining elegance is now exhausted, Who else will bring plum blossoms to the ancient temple tomb?</p>
<p>New Year's Eve of Yi Hai</p>
<p>The ultimate joy and sorrow fill tonight, The atmosphere of war burns red, flickering candle shadows, Changing the year in a chaotic world is ultimately the same, Sheltering guests in a high building is also desolate. Speechless, I can only stop the pain of all directions, Unable to bear the worry of the arrogance of the generals! Sitting until the sun follows the spring dreams, The emperor's black clothes are wet, and the roof tiles are frosted.</p>
<p>Matches by Wang Baili</p>
<p>In Japan, matches are called "rin sun," while in our country they are called "yang huo," or "zi lai huo." In Wenzhou, they are even called "zi lai huo zhu." They are made by dipping thin wooden sticks in flammable substances such as phosphorus and sulfur, and generating fire through chemical action by friction. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Austrian Preschel made red-headed matches (not the red-headed ones sold on the market today); the Swede Lundstrom made black-headed matches, which were silent when struck, which are the so-called safety matches today. According to Ruan Wushan's "Tea Leisure Guest Tales," people in the capital would scrape hemp stalks into small pieces, coat the ends with sulfur, and call them "qu deng" (fire-getters). People in Hangzhou would make them from pine wood, calling them "fa zhu" (fire sticks). According to historical records, during the sixth year of Zhou Jiande, poor consorts of Qi made a living by making "fa zhu." Furthermore, the "Qing Yi Lu" says, "At night, suffering from the slowness of lighting fire sticks, they would split fir wood and dye it with sulfur, which would ignite upon contact with fire, calling it 'yin er' (igniter)." All of these are precursors to today's matches. Is the Wenzhou people's term "zi lai huo zhu" perhaps a remnant of "huang zhu" (sulfur sticks)?</p>
<h3>Unfettered Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Chance Encounters (94)</p>
<p>Qi Wan saw that Dao Yun was speaking like he was on a stage, spouting a great philosophy. Even though he used himself as an example, his words were implicitly correct, and she was very moved. She immediately blurted out, "Mr. Liu, if you were unlucky in love, would you also adopt this attitude?" Dao Yun said, "I have experienced countless failures in love. I believe love is sacred, and the boundaries between love and friendship must be clear. Blind love will never have good results. So whenever I encounter setbacks, I never blame heaven or others, I only examine my own faults." Qi Wan nodded and said, "With Mr. Liu's views and experience, of course you wouldn't fail!" Dao Yun said, "It was wrong for me to make such remarks in front of Miss Gu today, but I am straightforward, please forgive me, Miss Gu." Qi Wan said, "What Mr. Liu said are golden words, and I am deeply grateful. Since I came to the hospital, I have been very depressed. I feel that life is too boring, and I even resent the doctor for saving me. I wish I had died and been done with it. Since talking to Mr. Liu, I feel a different kind of feeling, not as desolate and lifeless as before. I feel that there is still a path to walk in society, and I still have to move forward." Dao Yun clapped his hands and said, "That's right, you should move forward! A little stimulation is nothing. If Miss Gu feels that it is not suitable in Beiping, you can go elsewhere. As the saying goes, 'The sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly,' you can go anywhere, there is no need to stay in Beiping. I think with Miss Gu's talent, you will be very popular in Shanghai." Qi Wan said, "It's good to go to Shanghai, but opening a new market is also difficult. Besides, I have recently become very indifferent to the life of a dancer." Dao Yun said, "Miss Gu has a bright future, there is no reason to be passive!" Qi Wan said, "I have been in the theater for seven or eight years, and I am still in this state today, what is the point!" Dao Yun said, "Miss Gu, you need to broaden your horizons, muster your courage, and keep moving forward. Success depends on human effort. As long as you have perseverance and courage, you will succeed! If Miss Gu recognizes him and says that his family has businesses in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and he only left his field of study because he loved the life under the spotlight. His plan is to organize a huge film production company, recruit stars, and shoot a perfect film that will overwhelm the products of Shanghai and Hong Kong film companies. Finally, he talked about how Hollywood producers made fortunes, and that people in the industry would be successful in this type of business. They talked for two hours, and the more they talked, the more excited they became.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox: High Price of Rationed Rice - Urgent Appeal from the Common People</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Since the New Year, prices have been fluctuating and rising wildly without end, to the despair of us common people—how are we to live? In particular, the staple food of rice, which people cannot live without, has now reached an astonishingly high price of over four million yuan. At such exorbitant prices, the poor will inevitably become starving ghosts. No wonder people are in a state of panic, and the country's future is especially precarious. Our authorities, recognizing this, have decided to distribute rationed rice to alleviate the people's difficulties, which is truly a benevolent policy. However, implementation has been too slow, ultimately leading to the peak of rice prices. If the distribution had been done quickly at the time, the price would not have risen so much. But who would have known that the agreed distribution price would be almost the same as the market price of white rice, while in fact, those who rely on rationed rice for survival are all poor people. At such a high price, the poor will be in dire straits. I am now petitioning on behalf of the common people of Shanghai, that the price of rationed rice should not exceed half the price of white rice on the black market. This is because the price of the second phase of rationed oil was set at 24,000 yuan per jin, while the black market price of oil was around 70,000 yuan per jin. If this could be done, then the black market price of rice would definitely fall. Now, with 2.4 million yuan as the agreed price for rationed rice, there is no possibility of the market price of rice falling. Although it is beautifully called rationed rice, it is actually of no benefit to the people. Furthermore, reports indicate that the food distribution authorities have stated that the price of rice for March has been set at 2.4 million yuan per dan, and there is no possibility of reducing it. If it is reduced further, there is a risk of reverse flow, which would be undesirable. However, the price of rationed sugar and oil distributed each time is more than twice as cheap as the black market price, yet we have not heard of any reverse flow phenomenon. Furthermore, it is said that the purpose of this distribution of rice is to stabilize rice prices and delay the cyclical price increases. However, the black market price of rice has recently been soaring, and it has not been curbed at all because of the distribution of rice. Isn't this because the agreed price of rationed rice is too high? It must be understood that the people are the foundation of the country, and food is the priority of the people. We small citizens must request the government authorities to quickly review and reduce the price, so as to alleviate the people's difficulties and stabilize society. I am just a humble scholar, but I am still thinking about the country and society. I believe that all the officials in the government will also prioritize the lives of the people. Your newspaper serves society and your reputation spreads throughout the country. I hope you will give this special attention and speak for the people. Respectfully submitted, Lu Zhaoqi, March 6th.</p>
