<h3>主席面論張作相等決調大軍出關增援東北旅京人士呼籲救鄕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕蔣主席廿九日正式對東北　宿表示，中央絕對貫澈決不放棄東北之一貫政策。此語已予晋謁者以深刻印象，極受感動，並增强其信心。蔣主席係於廿九日上午十二時半召見張作相·萬福麟。馬占山·鄒作華四氏，由莫德惠·劉哲兩氏陪同前往。主席當招待午宴，府委陳布雷，國防部長白崇禧，政務局長陳方中，宣傳部副部長陶希聖作陪。席間張。萬。馬。鄒四氏分別就東北當前實况，尤其目前危機及亟待解決之問題，予以說明，其中並涉及內政與外交兩部份。渠等認爲東北目前難遭遇空前困難，然非不可挽救。其原因有二：第一，共匪在東北各地之殘暴罪行，較日人統治時代之毒辣手段，有過之無不及；第二，共匪在東北尙無深厚基礎，目前僅恃恐怖政策，維繫其暫時之控制，而東北人民則與共匪勢不兩立。有此兩因，東北之困難尙有辦法解除。渠等當建議兩事：（一）趕派大軍增援東北，確定現有據點，並積極打開交通綫；（二）有效運用東北地方之人力物力協助國軍作戰，同時組織民衆，加強地方武力，深入敵後。張等報吿畢，主席即表示政府堅守東北早具決心，此爲中央一貫政策，絕不變更。現有之軍事據點由國軍確守，不成問題，以後當積極打開交通綫。至運用地方人力物力，加强地方武力深入敵後一點，主席則甚表讚許。張·萬·馬·鄒四氏辭出後，對主席指揮若定，部署有素之態度，極拘樂觀，咸認主席有此決心，東北一定能有辦法。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕參院外交委員會主席范登堡今日宣稱，外交委員會現延期至三月十日開始舉行秘密會議，聽取各方對於援助中國與希臘及土耳其法案之意見。據與會人士談稱，贊成在軍事上援助中國者，均信將其列入援歐復興法案爲上策，蓋杜魯門總統決不致爲欲制止對華軍事援助而拒絕簽署援歐復典法案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕共和黨參議院撥　款委員會主席勃里奇，今夜抨擊政府之飛機援華報吿書，認爲係「勉强與表面」的努力。勃氏稱：「據余所知，戰勝日本以來，美國運華之飛機僅六百三十三架，其中一百五十八架因配備缺乏，不能使用，全部飛機中遝輸機佔一百九十七架，政府欲於中共攻擊日厲之時渡過關頭，則此種援助，完全不合。一九四六年八月以來，絕無一架戰鬥或轟炸機運往中國。政府並未供給中國飛機零件，亦已兩年之久。汽車若無汽油開動，仍歸無用，飛機亦然。除非能加以維持，政府並不努力眞正遵守對華義務。中國需要槍砲與彈藥供陸軍應用，截至目前爲止，政府對此迫切需要，顯然毫無作爲」。</p>

<h3>學風與學潮</h3>
<p>目前各級學校又正在紛紛閒學，大家當然注意到敎育。上月二十四日敎育部頒佈了一通整頓學風令。這一紙令文究竟能發生何種效果？這是大家心中的疑問。我們對於政府下令整頓學風的效率，向來是不甚相信的。不過這一次的整頓學風，却認爲有他的價値，値得相當的重視。</p>
<p>我們爲什密一向不重視整頓學風的命令呢？因爲「學風」的本義，乃是代表某一時代盛行的學術思想和那一時代學人的生活行爲之綜合表現。一時代有一時代盛行的學術思想，和那一時代學人的行爲風範，所以一時代就有一時代的學風。因而魏晋的學風異於漢末的學風，淸初的學風異於宋代的學風。雖然所謂某一時代學風不是三言兩語能够說得明自，但一提起來，大家都彷彿有一稱會心，一種瞭解。原因就在於他是那一時代學術思想和學人生活行爲之表現，祇要略知那一時代的學術思想和學人生活的，便自然懂得那一時代學風是怎樣的了。</p>
<p>惟其如此，因而學風是很難加以整頓的。因爲學術思想的形成，和學人的生活行爲的表現，都有其客觀的與主觀的種種條件，決不是一紙公文所可改變。良好的學風，祇能靠一點一滴，逐漸培養，或大思想家大學問家之學術領導，精神感召，才能養成。照這樣說法，所謂整頓學風，自然沒有多大用處的。這是我們一向不想信學風可以整頓的理由。</p>
<p>不過，這一次的整頓學風令，我們却有另一種看法。老實說，因爲，牠所要整頓的，是學潮而不是學風。學潮與學風，原是兩件事，不能混爲一談的。不過這兩件事，多少有點關係。古人說：「惡紫之奪朱，惡鄭聲之亂雅樂。」學風是朱，學潮就是紫。學風是雅樂，學潮便是鄭聲。學風本來有兩端，一端是優良，一端是敗壤。敗壞的學風，好像是一個人的身體衰弱。但身體衰弱未必就是有病。至於發生了學潮，那就等於害病了。要想把衰弱的身體變爲健康，需要有適當的營養，需要講究衛生，需要遝動，需要振作精神，需要心理安慰。這屬於培養學風的範圍。至於衰弱的身體生了病，那就非打針吃藥不可了。現在的整頓學風，第一步先應當打針吃藥，第二步才應當設法營養。</p>
<p>我們先談第一步。這一年來，學潮實在太多了！我們會根據報紙，做了一個小小的統計。一年來，全國專科以上學校，共發生學潮一百四十二次，涉及的學校有八十二校。中等學校還不在內。學潮次數最多的學校，一年間共發生過十次。浪費時間最多的，有一個學校半年間只上六個星期的課！這一年來，學生把罷課請願，當作家常便飯。以民主自由爲招牌，而侮辱師長，攻擊政府。以憲法爲掩護，而同學互毆，和警察衝突。不僅過去一年是如此，這種風氣，現在還在醞釀，還在繼續，實在有予以整頓的必要。</p>
<p>何以會有這樣多的學潮？我們不能不明白指出這是共產黨及其外圍份子所製造。這事件是極爲明顯的。例如若干學潮，最初雖然由個別問題而起，甚至爲的是愛國事件，但是到了後來，往往都變了質。去年五月學潮，原祇是少數學校的校址問題，經費問題，其後竟變爲全國性的「反饑餓」「反內戰」，和共然厲行的「吃光運動」。那次學潮，幾閙到不可收拾的地步。就是共黨以學潮爲第二戰塲的顯明表現。</p>
<p>共黨及其外國之發動學潮，是有組織，有計劃，而富於機動性的。一校發生事件，其餘各校立即附和。甲地有了行動，乙地隨即響應。去年五月十三日，上海交大學生上了北站，同日南京中大就罷了課。五月二十日到二十六日，一週之中，一天一校向敎育部請願，實行其一日一罷政策。又如本年一月的同濟學潮，這兒剛預備進京，那兒已將南京的住處接洽準備好。關於一個學校的自治會事件，竟勞動若干學校有人歡送，甚至有遠從北平趕來歡送的。原是學生事件，而工廠的工人，竟也前往參加。像這樣有組織有計劃的行動，不必等待搜出共黨文件已可看出是共黨及其外圍份子所爲了。</p>
<p>前年夏天，「民盟」尙未解散，他　在上海　作種種策動。當時發表過一個「上海文化界國難敎育方案」。那上面曾有這樣的話：「只有民族解放的實際行動，才是救國的敎育」！所謂民族解放，自然就是國際共產；以國際共產爲敎育目的，這是什麽用心？這不是明明要使整個敎育變爲共產鬥爭的工具麽？原方案又說：「一切敎育工作者，配介着所有的民主戰士，運用一切民主力量，爭取民主政治的實現，才是眞正的民主敎育。」這更是明目張膽要勾結共匪，打倒政府，而竟詭稱這才是民主敎育。這眞正誣蔑了民主敎育！共黨及其外圍之以學校爲第二戰塲，在這文件中，已給我們以極明顯的證據了。所以自從那時以後學校風潮接二連三一直鬧到規在。今日政府整頓學風，第一步就應賣成各校校長，肅請學校中潛伏的共匪及其附和份子。</p>
<p>其次說到敎育本身，也的確害了虛弱症，大有先天不足後天失調的樣子。以學校的建築設備而言，現在復員雖已兩載，實際尙未達到足用的程度。學校的經常費，最大的大學，每月亦不過一億餘元，普通只有五六千萬元，全數以付水電，尙嫌不敷，其餘設備購置，決談不到！國家總預算中，曾列一策外匯，供全國國立專科以上學校購置設備之用，但其款甚少。前年是五十萬美元，去年今年也都還是五十萬美元。一個學校，平均全年只分到幾千元，略購雜誌報紙，即已無餘，科學設備，更難談到。至於敎員待遇，則每月所得，「仰不足以事父母，俯不足以畜妻子」，啼饑號寒，困難萬狀。在這種形勢下，生活尙且難維持，更何能從事學術研究？即使有那好學的人，寗願忍饑耐寒，不發怨言，想從事學術硏究的，而設備困難，也無從做起。這樣一來，學術內容，根本就無法充實，好學風又從何會培養得起來？</p>
<p>所以，整頓學風有兩方面？第一要　減學潮，第二要增加敎育經費，充實學校建築設備，培養敎育元氣。關於第二點，政府當然應多多負責，關於第一點，斷不僅是政府的責任，學校校長敎員，以及眞正愛好好業的靑年，人人都應警覺，人人都應負責。共黨及共外圍份子一天不肅淸，敎育園地即一天不能安定。國家和個人，同受其害！</p>

<h3>委會成立會席上　蔣夫人致詞</h3>
<p>勉幼吾幼以及人之幼</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕蔣夫人廿九日在聯合國勸募兒童救濟金中國委會成立會席上致詞稱：</p>
<p>今大是聯合國普遍發動勸募世界難童救濟金的日子，它給予每一國家以發揮博愛精神　機會，中國爲聯合國之一員，自當竭盡所能，參與義舉。</p>
<p>全世界困苦受難的兒童，約計三億之多，占世界人口總數的五分之一以上，其中居於我國者約六千四百萬名。聯合國担負起這個艱直的人物，為此三億兒童請命，募集款項，解決他們的衣食住問題，其抱負之偉大，實在値得我們敬佩。</p>
<p>此一遝動，是針對着人類的責任心而作呼籲，如果對於苦難兒童的啼飢號寒，我們竟漢然無動於中，那就等於放棄了我們爲下一代建造優美世界的責任。此一運動正呼召我全國同胞，認識我們　負的責任，而盡我們應盡的義務。</p>
<p>此次的勸募，採取自動捐獻方式，而所得款項，將分配給全世界的貧苦兒童，不分種族，宗敎，國籍或政治信仰，一視同仁，絕無歧視。並將所捐得每一個錢，完全給予難童，如有因募捐而須用的經費，則另行設法。</p>
<p>在我國過去八年抗戰之中，接受了不少國外友人的　贈，戰時難童受益甚多，有些國家他們本身亦困苦艱難，仍不吝相助，這種精神，尤其值得我們的感謝。最近聯合國已以三五〇萬美元指定救濟中國兒童，我想各位一定與我有同樣的感想，我們不能只有接受，而不想給予。</p>
<p>我們要知道給與比接受更幸福，豐厚的播種，必有豐厚的收獲，我們中國誠然也在困乏之中，但此舉爲的是發揚博愛精神，因之我們的解衣推食，比之獨自享受，自然更有意義，我們的古諺有云「幼吾幼以及人之幼」，讓我們把中華民族這一個傳統的美德，充分的表現出來。</p>
<p>聯合國世界難童救濟中國區委員會的委員們，素以急公好義著稱，非常熱心於世界的公共福利，今天很多委員都在這裏開會，在我們艱難困苦的抗戰時期，各位都曾以時間心力或物質的貢獻，來减少戰時兒童及難胞的痛苦，我希望大家能同樣的用全心全力，來推進此次救濟全世界難童的工作，而爲我全國民衆的倡導。人生最光榮的成就，是其有帮助別人的力量，今天就是我們隊世界人類作最切實貢獻的機會，我們要絲毫下希冀別人的感謝或酬報，而慨然響應此次的募捐運動。</p>

<h3>援歐案移交美參院　國際局勢危急迫不容待　范登堡促請早日通過實施</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕參院外委會主席范登堡今日表示，捷克事件發生後，歐洲復興計劃已愈益迫切需要，時間因素已爲美國今後作爲之主要元素。歐洲復興方案將於星期一起在參院討論，希望能在討論其他援助法案，前，先解決此一方案，能於三月十五日即向衆院提出討論。范登堡所指之其他法案，意即援華及援希土之新計劃。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕參院外委會頃發表關於援歐之報吿，顯示該會確認歐洲國家若不獲援助，將不能維護其自由及獨立。該一報吿將附同該會之援歐法案草案，於週一一併送交參院。報吿書有云：「今日所必須決定者，乃爲吾人是否將繼續努力以完成建立穩定世界，確立自由政治制度及法治的目標。世界之安定與歐洲的安定，具有不可分的聯繫。自由制度及眞正獨立，不容其在歐洲滅亡，或在世界他處感受威脅。職是之故，吾人應本於所成立的決議，即歐洲若不獲經濟復興，能否維護其自由及獨立，而決定吾人應循的途徑。本會深知歐洲如不獲經濟復興，決不能維護其自由及獨立，因此對於歐洲復興計劃已給予最誠懇之審査。」報吿書繼述及蘇聯對歐洲復興方案的態度，略謂，「蘇聯及歐洲他國共黨，其地位可以對歐洲復興方案給予重大帮助，亦可危害該方案之成功。最近之發展，顯示共黨所將採取之途徑殆為後者。共黨經由共產情報局一再誹謗美國對歐洲復興方案之動機，若千參加方案之國內，已發生共黨策動之工潮及動亂，因而妨碍歐洲之生產努力。蘇聯尤其有獨特的地位，可以阻撓東西歐間貿易的恢復。最近東西歐間已成立或在談判中之貿易協定，不失爲予人以鼓勵之現象。」</p>
<h3>主張對東歐國家　仍保持門戶開放</h3>
<p>報吿書述及西歐聯盟計劃時有云，歐洲之經濟健全及歐洲國間更密切政治經濟關係的發展，爲和平與繁榮的並重因素，故歐洲復興方案之最後目標，不但在關稅同盟等方式下的經濟合作，亦爲　密切的政治及文化聯繫。關於參加國的問題，報吿書主張對芬蘭波蘭匈牙利羅馬尼亞保加利亞南斯拉夫捷古蘇聯諸國，仍應保持門戶之開放，使其得以參加。至於西班牙之最後能否參加，應視該國之願否接受方案下的篛務，其他參加國之願否容納西班牙，及西班牙能否與業國締結滿意的協定而定。報吿書最後復日，此種和平時代的援助，爲人類史上所未有，此等援助不能爲美國外交政策上的永久因素。歐洲國家家知美國之採取此一重大決議，其所負担之責任殊不在歐洲國家之下，其目的在謀共同福利及和平，世界人士務須對此有共同的了解。</p>
<h3>西歐聯盟計劃　英法荷比盧作初步技術討論　五國總理會議在部署中</h3>
<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾廿九日電〕比總理史巴克單　接見本社記者談稱，召開英法荷比盧五國總理會議，以討論西歐聯盟計劃之事，已在部署之中。渠於上星期提出召開此一會讓之建議，不久即可成立決議。惟在五國總理會談之前，尙須準備談判的堅定基礎。</p>
<p>職是之故，可能先由專家在五國首都中之一，就與建立西歐聯盟有關之問題，舉行初步技術討論。此等討論不妨與現在倫敦舉行之三强德國問題會議平行舉行。當記者提及紐約所傳美國正計劃與英法荷比締結同盟條約之說時，史巴克表示未聞有此等計劃。繼日，若果有其事，既爲極度重要之事，自當予以最審愼的考慮。史巴克並表示希望最近東歐之事件，不致變更馬歇爾方案最近在美可望順利通過的趨勢。馬歇爾方案愈爲必要，愈應迅速通過施行。</p>
<h3>歐洲十六國會議　下月中召集</h3>
<p>英法請柬已發出</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕此間宣布英法已向參加馬歇爾方案之其他十四國，發出請柬，邀其於三月中旬重開歐洲十六國會議，開會日期暫定爲三月十五日，可能延遲數日。貝文及皮杜爾將親自出席兩次全體會議</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕歐洲十六國社　黨討論馬　爾方案之會議，將於三月廿一日在倫敦舉行，英工黨代表團在　中所將採取之正式立塲，已成工黨議員討論之目標。彼等之意見別爲兩派，一派爲麥凱氏領導之聯邦主義派，主張在一歐洲制憲議會之下，建立西歐諸國間之政治合併。一派爲工黨左翼領袖克勞資曼領導之實務主義派，主張設立僅具州格經濟觀念的西歐聯盟。克勞資曼一派主張設立永久性的歐洲執行機構，西德代表亦得以觀察員之身份參加，並擬成立共同物品局，實施糧食及原料等之統購，此外並設共同企劃局，擬具十二個月內之緊急計劃，尤時別注意於農業。</p>
<h3>艾登發出呼籲　西歐加緊團結</h3>
<p>〔路透社英裕蘭李明登廿八日電〕前外相艾登今日在此談稱，捷克之政變爲一危險信號，西方强國與美國應加緊合作，以維護尙吿倖存的自由。爲使西方聯盟時政治上及軍事上從事互助。</p>
<h3>倫敦會議討論　魯爾區管制</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕英美法三强討論西德問題之會義，今日在英外交部內召開第四次會議，討論魯爾區未來之管制，荷比盧代表團亦參加。會議結束後發表下列簡報，「本屆會議雖保持機密性質，惟所堪發表者，乃爲會談係在坦白友好的精神下舉行。」</p>
<h3>對巴勒斯坦問題　應採取必要措施</h3>
<p>英讓　聯名致電聯合國</p>
<p>〔聯介社成功湖廿八日電〕聯合國安理會星期二重新討論巴勒期坦問題。據聯合國秘書長雷依宣稱，茲接英國會議員四十五人聯名來電，認爲巴勒斯坦問題乃一「試騐性案件」，並　請安理會採取各種必要措施，以資對付目前該地內外破壞國際安全之危機。</p>

<h3>芬蘭準備接受蘇建議　史達林函件發表　芬駐蘇公使昨奉召歸國</h3>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基廿八日電〕據本社探悉：芬蘭大部份政黨均已準備接受史達林元帥之建議，與蘇聯訂立軍事互助及友好條約。據莫斯科電台廣播史達林元帥致芬總統巴西基維之專函，全文如下：</p>
<p>「爲積極改進蘇芬兩國間之關係，以謀鞏固和平與安全起見，蘇聯政府建議由蘇芬兩國締結等於蘇匈·蘇　條約之友好互助條約。芬蘭苟不反對，希即派遣代表團來蘇聯，以締結此一條約。如芬政府認爲談判宜在芬蘭境內舉行，蘇聯政府亦準備派代表團前來海辛爾幸基。蘇聯部長會議主席史達林謹啓」蘇政府致芬政府之照會，除附致前函外，並指出芬蘭乃前敵國之與蘇聯接壤者唯一尙未與蘇成立此項條約之國。蘇照會並未規定芬蘭答覆之期限，故將由芬蘭國會依憲法程序討論此事。</p>
<p>〔合衆社海爾辛基廿九日電〕芬蘭駐蘇公使預計可於廿九日歸抵此間，然消息靈通人士對公使携有蘇政府新照會之說，表示懷疑。該方面人士以爲公使奉召歸國，係向政府報吿蘇聯對建議中之蘇分同盟條約之態度。</p>
<p>〔合衆社海爾辛基廿八日電〕蘇聯公使沙伏能柯夫今日入總統官邸接談七分鐘，以便聆悉芬政府對史達林建議之意見·芬關政治家承認蘇聯握有强大之武器，此即榖物是也。如無蘇聯之榖物，則芬蘭勢將發生飢饉。政治領袖及社會公衆均反對與任何國家訂盟，但共黨則贊成該建議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海爾辛基廿八日電〕芬總統在星期二以前或將派遣代表團赴莫斯科，參加談判事宜。莫斯科電台今夜廣播雖謂謂蘇芬條約，旨在預防未來總國之侵略，兩國遭受德國侵略損害頗重，如再發生同樣事，則兩國政府均應向其人民負責。但一般人士所最關切者，厥在史氏要求是否純爲保護蘇聯領土，尤其是列寗格勒，抑或別有居心。</p>
<h3>葉門國內爭　阿柴姆前往調處</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅廿八日電〕阿拉伯聯盟秘書長阿柴姆率領之代表團，已於今日離蘇彝士乘船前往葉門，以調處該國兩派之爭。</p>
<h3>世界食米會議　今在碧瑤揭幕　我可望當選大會副主席</h3>
<p>〔中央社碧瑤廿八日電〕糧農組織食米會議籌備委員會今日下午舉行兩小時之秘密會議，進行三月一日開幕之食米會議之籌備工作，會中接受我首席代表謝澄平之建議，決定食米會議應有副主席二人。覜察家認爲菲律賓以地主國，極可能當選會議主席，中國·印度。爲亞洲二大米之消費國家，將被選爲副主席。籌備會議　決定設立四小組委負會硏究：（一）生產，（二）市塲與分配，（三）建議中之國際食米組織，（四）增進米產量及改善世界經濟之四年計劃。中國在營養及漁業二委員會中，均正式請求在　設立營養研究中心及印度洋太平洋漁業委員會。</p>
<h3>朝鮮委會明日離美　飛漢城恢復工作　南韓開始普選最快須五月初</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿八日電〕與聯合國朝鮮委員會接近方而人士廿八日預料：朝鮮開始選舉最快亦須定五月二日。此間委員會諸委員將於三月二日飛赴漢城，定三月六日到達，以便曾合邑抵達該處之委員，於三月八日起恢復工作。</p>
<p>渠等之進展將密切注視成功湖方面，蓋該處若干外交家深恐目前在南部朝鮮發生之混亂，可能使五月二日選舉延期也。委員會三月八日最初任務之一，即爲硏究監督及觀察選舉之條件，並決定普選並包括若干地區。關於此點，該委員會將接受美國協助至若何程度，亦在考慮中。此間若干人士認爲如美國協助太多，則將引起抨擊，以爲美國壓力影響選舉結果。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿八日電〕軍事總督狄思中將向各省警察局長重申命令，促使彼等維特法律及秩序，並應對各該省長負責。此舉顯係防止警察干涉可能即將到臨之總選。</p>
<h3>韓境美當局否認　邊境掘壕說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿儿日電〕美軍當局二十九日强調否認外傳美軍沿北緯三十八度（即美蘇在朝鮮佔領區之交界）設防一說。美軍官方發言人稱：沿邊境供戰術訓練或其他目的之壕塹，以前旣絕無設置，目下亦無建造，該發言人又稱，離邊境若干哩內亦無一砲隊。</p>
<h3>克里浦斯談　英對蘇政策</h3>
<p>經濟方面覓取友誼</p>
<p>〔路透社勃里斯托爾廿八日電〕財相克里浦斯在此被詢及蘇聯目前之政策是否將引起戰爭時，表示與蘇覓取友誼最好的方法，爲在經濟方面與蘇元成若干切實措施。渠並日，英國對蘇聯之政策，應受聯合國機構義務及對蘇友好條約之約束。</p>
<h3>英艦侵犯領土　危向聯合國控訴</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功　廿八日電〕危地瑪拉業於今日正式向聯合國機構抗議英巡艦之駛八「危地瑪拉土地」。危國外長致電聯合國秘書長賴依稱，英國對危地瑪拉從事武裝桃　，以維護「感受危地瑪拉境內不負責份子威脅」之利益爲　口，漏遺巡艦「歇費爾特」號「特　郡」進及驅逐艦「麻雀」號至危地　拉領土內之貝利資，余謹代危地瑪拉政府，正式向聯合國聲明反對英國此等行動。危地瑪拉政府鄭重否認英國之指責，並强力抗議英艦之駛入危國士地。危地瑪拉專待聯合國採取行動以離公理。</p>
<h3>捷克政潮告結束　共黨總理強調根絕「反動」勢力　蘇外次索林遄返莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿八日電〕全副武裝之捷克警察隊今日大遊行，顯示政潮之已結束，蘇聯外次索林在捷京逗劊十天，亦過於今晨返歸莫斯科。同時行動委員會仍積極推進其整肅計劃。戈德華總理今晨向農民委員會致辭，表示將斷然整肅行政機構，並擬在依法舉行新選舉以前通過大規模的立法計劃。戈氏並强調根絕政黨法團公共機關內反動勢力之必要。述及政府之一般計劃時，渠云循工會之要求，政府將廢止私人經營批發，將由國家管制進出口，私人企業僱員在五十人以上者一律改爲國營，手工業及小商販之利益在憲法中將予保障。又據捷克中央行動委會宣布，捷克之國民生活，將集中於改組後的國家陣綫之內。國家陣綫之決議，對各黨均有拘束力。政黨非經行動委會批准不能作政治活動。</p>
<h3>西爪哇馬拉圖政治發展　調委會將予注意　安理會通過我代表建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿九日電〕聯合國安理會廿九日議決延長印荷關解委員會之壽命，表決期蘇聯棄權。印尼指責荷蘭策動在印尼共和國疆土上成立傀儡國家，安理會要求立即調査此事，安理會要求調解委員會繼續執行其職務，並根據最近談判成功之停戰協定，談判永久之政治解決。哥倫比亞建議以更大之力　於委員會，然被否決。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿八日電〕安理會今日辯論印尼問題之際，通過中國所提之決議案，令聯合國調解委員會特別注意西爪哇及馬圖拉島之政治發展。蘇聯，烏克蘭，阿根廷三國均棄權。安理會並通過加拿大所提之決議案，請印·荷雙方多多借重聯合國調解委員會之服務，此一決議案，並未能予調解委會以較前更多之權力，不若中國所提決議案之使調解委會職權，擴大至於西爪哇及馬圖拉。印尼問題辯論，至此已暫吿一段落。</p>
<h3>秘魯軍人內閣就職</h3>
<p>〔路透社里瑪廿八日電〕秘魯之「軍人內閣」已於今日宣誓就職。舊閣員蟬聯者有總理內長敎育部長等五人。主要閣員如下：內閣總理兼財長沙爾狄亞海軍少將，外長李伏里多將軍。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶錄　（三）（六）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>對已對人合作總有好處的</p>
<p>一九四四年將近秋季時，我與我的同事們開始懷疑史達林大元　及其政府，是否已開始在背離他們在莫斯科會議中所同意的合作政策，這僩政策，除少數例外外，他們渦去會奉行迄今的。</p>
<p>我們開始獲悉跡象，蘇聯在對匈牙利·保加利亞和羅馬尼亞的和約中，將作强硬討價，使他們能幾乎掌握住這些國家。同時，我們對蘇聯在安全理事會中於投票問題所採的强硬態度，也正不得不密切注意。</p>
<p>於是，九月十八日，我致電在莫斯科的哈里曼大使，提及在鄧巴頓橡樹會議中所發生的投票問題。我說，這件事情，加上哈里曼所報吿的一些別的最近演變，使我們對於蘇聯將來長期的政策，引起莫大疑竇。我並且說，我已開始懷疑，史達林與克列姆林宮諸巨頭是否已決定改變他們在莫斯科和德黑闌會議中所確定的政策，而另走一條完全相反的道路。所以，我要哈里曼對蘇聯目前政策的趨向，作一種估量，使我們可以決定如何來應付蘇聯態度的這個可能的改變。</p>
<p>我對哈里曼說，他如能吿訴我他的看法，何以蘇聯的對美政策發生這種轉變，何以蘇聯對英的態度轉爲强硬，其原因何在，則我將更感有用。</p>
<p>第二天，哈里曼覆電來了，舉出了幾個蘇聯片面行動或顯然與英美不願合作的實例。他說：我們有足够的證據，可以預料假使我們成立這樣一個國際組織，規定遇有任何國際糾紛，討論時必須獲得所有常任理事國之同意，不管它本身是否爲糾紛當事國之一，則蘇聯政府必將毫不劊情地抵制安全理事會討論任何它認爲將影響自己利益的問題。蘇聯政府並將堅特，這種事情應由蘇聯及別的當事國本身直接解決，特別是有關它和鄰國間的任何糾紛。</p>
<p>哈里曼表示他的信心說，史達林及其主要顧問們把蘇聯與其他三强間大體上的合作，置於最重要的地位，但他們希望，他們政治與軍事的實力能使自己左右這種情勢。他說，無疑的，蘇聯人民渴望和平，且相信，在戰時與英美兩國所發展的密切關係，在戰後仍將繼續，並保證一種長期恒久的和平。</p>
<p>大使不信史達林能背棄了這種合作所具有的物質與心理上的價値，而不致在蘇聯人民間引起嚴重的不安。但是，接近史達林的還有些有力份子，他們不願在蘇聯利益有關的地區放棄自己獨立行動的權利，不願見蘇聯把自己的安全完全倚託在一個尙未嘗試過的世界組織上，和那些他們所並不完全信任的國家合作。哈里曼覺得，史達林是喜歡有備無患的，所以自然的，他會同時連用這兩個方法，以獲取自己國家的安全，並增强他所認爲是自己國家的利益。</p>
<p>當我離開國務院時，我所主張的對蘇政策建立於兩個基礎上。第一是：繼續與蘇聯作經常的，友誼的協商。在任何事件上和他們商量。向他們解釋我們認爲促成國際和平關係所需要的原則，如果需要，解釋不惜一次又一次，儘可能淸楚地使他們看出，蘇聯如和別的國家全衷合作可得更多的利益，而控制鄰國則只有很少的好處。讓他們淸楚明白，我們並不反對一個國家宣傳其自身政府形式的優點，不管這是共產卞義或是民主政治，但我們反對一個國家去干涉別的國家的內政。</p>
<p>我希望，如果我的健康能允許我繼續任職的話，能促使蘇聯採取一種西半球所共同奉行的合作和不十涉政策，把這來作爲一種確定的世界政策，所有國家都能信守不漁。在這種移植到歐洲去的泛美政策之下，蘇聯可以和它的鄰邦保有最友善的政治關係，和最旺盛的經濟交換，而不必干涉到它們的內政。</p>
<p>我們對蘇政策的第二部份是：以我們自己的行動表現，來給蘇聯一個實際的榜樣，吿訴他們，我們覺得他們應該怎樣做。所以我反對聯合參謀本部的意見，把從日人手中奪得的太平洋島嶼由美國保有。我强烈感到一切從軸心國家手中奪回的殖民地，都應置於聯合國統治系統之下，絕不能有所例外。這是很容易看出的，蘇聯不致已對我們對這些島嶼的立時的佔有；但這也是很容易看出的：蘇聯將以此作爲先例，自己將來也作相似的佔有。我們佔有了這些島嶼，將來就無法再反對別的國家作類似的行動了。</p>
<p>所以，我也以對一九四五年三月，我辭戰以後，在莫西哥城會議，所通過的夏波塔員克法案中的計劃，即美洲諸共和國事實上同意在某種情形下得於其中任一國家作軍事上的干涉。我們一同意了這種新的干涉地位，那末蘇聯就更有藉口可以干涉他們的鄰邦，而我們亦將無理由可以反對了。</p>
<p>同樣地，我也不願附和章爾斯會同陸海軍當局所倡議的計劃，即西半球軍備的標準化，道意思就是說，美國將在和平時期裝備好拉丁美洲諸共和國。我覺得，武裝它們，並在適當時須要它們作戰，這將是一件很困難也很不公的事情，因爲我們知道它們不能打，而它們對我們的帮助，正如道次大戰中的情形所示，在經濟方面以及基地的使用上，較之戰塲上的帮助尤爲重要。</p>
<p>同時，我也反對改變我們戰時對與納粹聯合的阿根廷國家主義的不妥協政策。在墨西哥城和舊金山會議中的妥協態度，讓阿根廷加入了聯合國，削弱了美國與蘇聯間原可存在的互信之心。</p>
<p>羅斯福與我在對蘇問題上看法甚屬相似，我們都感覺，兩國關係的路途並非康莊大道，但我們也感覺，我們可以和蘇聯共同相處。就我記憶所及，我和總統在這一個基本假定上意見毫無不同，就是：我們必須且亦能够和蘇聯政府友善相處。</p>
<p>總統和史達林，邱吉爾在雅爾達會議中所商討的問題，事先他未和我討論，我也一點不知道在會中所給與蘇聯的秘密讓步。直至後來密約公開發表方才知悉。雅爾達是我離職以後羅斯福總統所參加的唯一的國際會議。我對於諸强國間各種問題的意見，皆詳細記載於國務院列次會議與談話的紀錄之中。至我離職時，我仍反對給與蘇聯的投票權可較我們自己的爲多。我的見解是：每一强國，旣有如此有力的願望與影響，則在任何時間要獲得其權利與利益的充分表達，皆可毫無問題，需保有一票以上的投票權。</p>
<p>我辭職後，總統來醫院探親時，包括他逝世前數日最後一次的來訪，他都從未向我提及可能有任何恐懼，以爲蘇聯將放棄我們爲和平的合作運動，或者將阻撓破壞它。因爲他和我自一九三三年以來即曾共同努力，以獲致與蘇聯更進一步的瞭解，至於我們的共同計劃和平機構，自　不必說了，所以我深信，假如他已確實感覺蘇聯正在走着一條危險的務途，他必會向我提及此事的。</p>
<p>人家可以這樣說：總統和我都被蘇聯的諾言與保證欺騙了，我們應該知道，和蘇聯打交道是不可能的，我們早就該看出，民主政體的美國不可能和一個共產主義的政府做朋友，所以，我們應該自始起即對蘇聯採取一種　　政策。</p>
<p>但當我們回顧與莫斯科的種種關係時，我感覺，羅斯福總統也如此感覺，我們的採取這種友善政策，極有理由。自一九一七年來，蘇聯即曾與許多拒絕承認它的國家搏鬥，這些國家拒絕承認，多少是爲了蘇聯那種從莫斯科指揮煽惑變亂的政策。靠了長期的努力，它總算漸漸獲得了更多國家的承認，差不多每一次進行承認蘇聯的談判時，都使它不得不同意對和它建立關係的國家，不再作煽惑變亂的活動。</p>
<p>它並沒有究全放棄這種活動，這是事實。但我們覺得，別的國家，只要堅定地組織，建郵並加强世界抵制這種活動的與論，必可促成蘇聯放棄這種干涉他國內政的策略。事實顯示，總統和我，在自一九三三年承認蘇聯起至一九四三年莫斯科會議』這段期間內，對蘇聯政府曾數度採取强硬手段。我從不放過機會，對蘇聯指出他們放棄那種辣手的千涉政策後對自己的好處。</p>
<p>總統和我相信，蘇聯能十足成爲聯合國安全機構之一員，全心全意與之合作，這對蘇聯自己最有好處，這個事實，蘇聯領袖們必可認淸。我們那時相信，我現在也仍如此相信，聯合國級織最後必將成爲一個統一，有力的機構，有充分力量足以維持和平。我們也知道，困難是一定有的，有些並將由蘇聯而來，聯合國組織必須經過一段飄搖脆弱的時期；但至一九四四年底時，我們已確知，我們及與我們共同努力的國家，已爲這一計擬中的機構打下基礎，在這個機構甲，蘇聯和我們可以共同合作。</p>
<p>在對蘇關係上，有數次時機，總統和我也時常擁獲我們軍事高級將領們確切的意見，說是從他們軍事的觀點說，戰後和蘇聯的友善合作，也是十分必要的。</p>

<h3>魏副局长指示四點中央需兵殷急不能緩期減額</h3>
<p>列席指導之兵役局副局長魏汝霖繼之致詞，轉達對本市征兵之四項指示，略謂（一）戡亂時期，中央需兵殷急，故全國征兵時，一不能緩期，二不能減額。上海兵額爲六千名，限六月底前完成。現在上海人口五百多萬，僅佔千分之一强，全國其他各乃配合政治，經濟，文化之叛亂，其征兵制度，着重民兵，故補充迅述，實堪注意，以爲我人征兵之參考。（三）上海去年之志願兵，成績尙可滿意。今年如能抽籤最好，如不得已仍用志願兵亦可，惟新兵安家費不能一次發給，須經常貼補其家屬，又保人必須穩妥，且有效期間必須爲二年，迄退伍時止。（四）有人認爲中國已有四五百萬兵，何必一定要在上海征兵六千人，然在全國立塲言，上海不能不征，上海爲國際大都市，不征兵即不不公允。魏副局長並特別指出，本市本期征兵爲六千，嗣後仍須　軍事需要。另定配額。次由李副司令。潘議長。傳司令。張局長等相繼致詞。</p>
<h3>人人保衛家鄉潘主委對新兵建議就地訓練</h3>
<p>市參會議長兼兵役協會主委潘公展係昨晨特自首都趕回，出席兵役曾議者，潘氏於昨日致詞時，對本　所征六千新兵，建議就地訓練，用以保衛地方。並籲請有錢者應多出錢，俾壯丁安心從戎，與有力者出力相配合。</p>
<p>潘主委致詞要點如下：（一）吾人就兵役局魏副局長指示中，獲得一種關於征兵的新啓示。即共匪如何發動民力，以爲摧毁生產背叛國家之憑籍。故吾人應一致認識，尤共上海市民必須認識，有共匪即無吾人之生存。而共匪何以兵源不缺，吾人何以感到征兵困難，其原因全在方法，吾人應即知彼知已，舍短取長，先就人民心理與地方需要入手，然後再進而求　澈國家之兵役政策。（二）然則本市應如何實施本年度的征兵呢？我以爲先應規定按照兵役法征集之壯丁六千名，在本市就地訓練，編成地方之自衛武力，充分發揮人人保家鄉之觀念，保障本市之安全。蓋本市爲全國最大之工商都市，國稅財源　半賴本市，故保衛本市之安全，無異即爲保衛國家之安全。且新兵必須有充分訓練，而後可以養成營伍生活之習慣，以及保衛地方作戰之技能。將來可以逐級　升，至訓練相當時期，必有自吿奮勇，踴躍爭先之衛國健兒，則本市市民必更報以崇高之敬禮，優其待過，安其家室，使之勇於殺賊，絕無後顧之憂。</p>
<p>槍不離人　人不離鄉</p>
<p>（三）而且馬歇爾將軍在軍時期，及回美以後，對我國軍政之批評，即重在人員補充制度之改進。馬帥極端反對以毫未受有訓練之農村壯丁，送上前綫　載，此在本人，深有同感。故兵役協曾在此次會議中，提議本年度本市征兵第一期六千名，應請規定在本市就地訓練，以保衛地方爲其第一任務。果爾，則本市此次征兵，槍不離人，人不離鄉，先養成人人願服兵役之習慣，凡及齡壯丁固無不踴躍以赴也。而况此　進步改良之征兵辦法，即在前方高級將領中亦已有不少主張之人，本市爲中外看膽所繁，允宜率先倡導，以爲逐漸改進役政之　矢。</p>
<p>有力出力有錢出錢</p>
<p>（四）服兵役爲國民天　，宜按「有力出力有錢出錢」之旨，秉公推行。本市去年征兵三千名，採用志願兵方式，政府與人民團體合作，辦理雖不盡如理想，而差幸足額，堪以吿慰。惟志願兵制亦有其缺點，且安家費慰勞費之募集，頗費心力。急公好義者固多，而爲富不仁，一毛不拔者亦所在皆是。至今一百七十億之開支中，尙有四十五億銀行借款未價，大約三十億元之免緩征召壯丁所繳之保證金（不核准者須退還）當須退還。故兵役協會所負之七十餘億債務，還有待於協力籌措彌補。乃今年即須又辦兵役，吾人不得不鄭重呼籲，爲地方爲健兒，向富有資力者懇求，慷槪輸將，樂助其成。須知衛地方，保國家，亦即所以保衛一般人之生命財產，大難當前，必須羣策盡力以克服之，決不容吾人　安躱避也。</p>
<h3>新兵年資</h3>
<p>又會後據傳司令稱：抽籤征兵原則已決定，所抽年資，爲自廿一歲至廿三歲，其方法爲間接抽籤，由兵役協會組設抽籤委員會主其事，以昭鄭重。關於潘議長公展建議新兵就地訓練，編爲地方自衛團隊一案，曾經熱烈討論，將請示蔣主席決定。</p>
<h3>全力遏止紗價暴漲抽查倉庫存紗首批十大紗號涉嫌　吊核帳冊</h3>
<p>本市新春以來，物價漲風狂烈，而棉紗波動竟居領導地位，花紗布管理委員會對此甚爲重視，並謀全力遏止紗價暴漲起見，經飭該會稽査處，會同市警察局經濟科，商定臨時緊急措施。自今日開始，實行抽査全市倉庫存紗，並經有關機關供給密報，首批共有十大紗號涉有操縱居奇嫌疑已進行吊核各號交易賬册及存紗倉庫地點。同時警局經濟警察隊奉命目即日起加緊監視各業市塲交易活動，尤對棉紗市特別注意，今後如發現有塲外買賣行爲，一律逮捕法辦。</p>
<h3>上月指數突增後工商業益趨艱苦</h3>
<p>信誼廠提解僱减工辦法</p>
<p>自上月份生活指數於前日發表後，工商界以指數較前月突增五成以上，頗多反應，據官方推測，今後產業界减工解僱之糾紛，勢將增多，惟有盼望勞資雙方，切實諒解合作，以挽當前危機，尤盼工人能努力增加生產，補償廠方巨額之工資支出。至於减工解僱情形，現已開始醞釀於營業不振之各業中，例如信誼華廠，資方已通知該廠產業工會，擬具緊縮辦法兩項，請工友任擇其　（一）依法解僱女工一百廿名，發給解散費。（二）採取輪流工作制，每人每月工作半個月。以上兩項，前者爲解僱，後者爲减工，均影響勞方生活，已由該廠工會函請廠方收回成命云。</p>

<h3>根絕桑蝗創舉採孵化寄生蜂新法派員分赴各地工作</h3>
<p>淸明節前育蠶開始，如何根絕桑蝗，保護桑苗繁盛，以增强蠶之食糧　實爲重要問題之一。過去保護桑苗，不外向桑　繁殖區域，　先廣事採掘桑蝗卵塊，每每事後未能根絕。本年度農林部計劃則異是，其法先將掘取桑蝗之卵塊，分批運往浙大農學院，放置於培養室中，使其孵化成爲一種寄生蜂，（按此蜂最喜覓食桑蝗），然後再以寄生蜂散放於桑蝗未盡區域，使其盡凈。此法非僅農林都對蠶絲事業之一種新猷，亦爲我國撲滅桑蝗之創舉。茲悉：以上計劃，業經江浙政府代表會同中國蠶絲公司商討成熟，其經費預定十億元，軍　擔任半數，餘由江浙政府分攤，幷聘請浙大農學院院長蔡邦華（昆蟲專家）任總隊長，中蠶專門委員張自方爲副總隊長，本週內即派隊員分赴吳江，吳與等桑蝗猖獗地區，配合地方政府鄉鎭及蠶桑指導人員，開始工作。</p>

<h3>物價高漲大原因由於經濟精神病經濟部長答記者問斥和談爲無稽謠言</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕經濟部陳部長啓天，日前來滬公幹，昨晚乘車返京。記者於其行前往訪，對記者所提各項問題，發表意見如下：（一）問：吳市長約先生所談何事？答：商談上海聯合電力公司問題，經濟部與上海市雙方對此問題，在原則上完全無異議，其餘技術問題，尙待經續協商。本人以職責所在，當盡力促成該公司早日成立，以解決上海工廠用電問題。（二）問：最近物價激漲之原因為何？答：其原因甚多，此刻不克詳說，但就最近物價高漲之原因言，則一：由於東北游資匯集上海，搶購物資；二：由於奸人造製謠言，激起一般人之「經濟精神病」，以便漁利。現在東北所來之游資，已大部有出路，時局亦已明朗，謠言無人置信，一般人之「經濟精神病」，因此稍好，物價自可暫平。</p>
<p>穩定幣值疏通物產</p>
<p>（三）問：先生對於平抑物價有何有效辦法？答：根本的有效辦法，（一）須改革　幣制，穩定幣價。（二）須努力建設，促進生產。（三）須恢復交通，疏運物產。（四）須改善輸入制度，吸收國外資金及物資。（五）須盡力　亂，建立和平。以上種種辦法，政府或巳在　備中，成已在進行中，待完全實施以後，即可完全穩定物價。至於當前應急的有效辦法，自不外斟酌情形管理金融，物資及物價，並取締囤積居奇，以醫治「經濟精神病」。</p>
<p>深盼美國長期援華</p>
<p>（四）問：先生對於美國援助意見如何？答：馬歇爾欲藉美國援助，穩定中國經濟，使中國得有喘息機會，以便中國徐圖自力更生，吾人自應感激，並應妥善運用此次美國援助於經濟建設方面，使其確能促進生產，穩定物價，以副美國朋友之希望。不過中國在軍事，財政，經濟，以及幣制改革等方面所需要援助，決非五億七千萬元，所能濟事；除五億七千萬元之救急援助外，尙須大規模之長期援助，美國對於中國之援助愈大愈早，則中國之復興亦愈早矣。</p>
<p>民主共產絕不相容</p>
<p>（五）問：先生對於時局前途之觀察如何？答：當前時局之所以嚴重，其種因須溯源於雅爾達曾議。該曾議允許蘇聯繼承帝俄時代在東北之所有權利，乃造成當前之嚴重時局。如果雅爾達會議，不允許蘇聯繼承帝俄時代在東北之侵略權利，則中國政府，早經完全接收東北，決不致演成今日之東北局面。但東北局面無論如何嚴重，政府已決定堅守到底，絕無和談之可能。何以不能再有和談，因爲民主與共產絕對不能相容，因爲共匪利於中國混亂，不利於中國和平。如果民主與共產可以相容，則馬歇爾對中國及歐洲之種種計劃，不致迭遭蘇聯及共匪之打擊矣。美蘇旣無法言和，則國共亦無法言和，故和談決不可能，和謠決不可信。</p>

<h3>光明自由的天堂　杭市電氣業一暼</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州二月廿四日訊〕在東南富庶區域，普遍閙着電荒的問題，各大城鎭，如南京，無錫，蘇州，上海等地的電力，都不能舒暢的供應，還要節制用電，分區停電，始能維持現狀的電力。再如浙贛路最近通達的南昌，記者會到過該處，常時要分區停電，即不輪到停電的區域，電炬也只能像一支臘燭，光綫十分黯淡。</p>
<p>浙江省在戰前　電的電廠，各縣鎭在內，有一百多家，戰後恢復的只有二十四五家之數，可見復員之不易。而杭州電廠反能</p>
<p>供應自如</p>
<p>能量充沛，這實在是普遍閙電荒中一個優異的成績。據杭州電廠的負責人吿訴記者：「該廠在戰前　浙江，爲規模最大的民營電氣事業，擁有閘口及艮山門兩發電所，發　容　爲一萬七千瓦特，二十六年冬，日寇犯境，由國軍自動將閘口發電所的七千五百瓦特發電機兩座，連同一切附屬設備，多所炸壞，淪陷時期，該廠事業又被敵人侵佔，利用艮山門二千瓦特發電機發電，庫存材料，刧取殆盡，各區輸電綫路三分之一以上被毁或被竊，計有桿木五千餘枝，　綫一百餘英哩，此外各小街支巷的低壓綫路，因當時銅價昂貴，頗多由敵人換裝鐵絲綫，以致電壓低降，燈光黯淡。幸而抗戰勝利，該廠迅吿接收復業，儘先着手修理戰時被燬機械，積極整頓各區高低壓綫路，恢復戰前發電原有總容量。」</p>
<p>現在該廠的七千五百瓦特兩部發電機</p>
<p>全部修復</p>
<p>計有一萬五千開羅瓦特，論其能量，照杭市現在的用電標準，尙相距甚遠，所以他們能應付裕如，得心應手。在杭州鄰接的上海，霓虹燈是被節制應用的，滬南南市一帶都要分區停電，工廠用電也要受到限制。而杭州却沒有感到這種困難，當你夜間漫步在每一條衝要的馬路上，紅紅綠綠的霓虹燈照炫得你心神欲醉，同時杭市的各工廠，各商店，各住戶都可以源源不絕的使用電力。據電氣事業中人談，像這樣電氣事業應付裕如的都會，恐怕全國之中，只有台灣與杭州兩處，而台灣爲水力發電者，杭州却是火力發電。記者對於這個使杭州五十萬市民獲得光明自由的電廠，發出了濃厚的興趣，於是去十華里以外的閘口，作了一番訪問。</p>
<p>閘口電廠</p>
<p>巍巍的四層大慶，矗立在錢塘江之濱，廠屋面積約一百二十尺長，一百四十尺闊，分鍋爐間，透平間，配電間及辦公室四個部鬥。有眞空器三座，以蒸汽使用容　，每座每小時能抽氣五十磅，又有石板一座，裝有透平機之各種重要表具，如汽壓表，眞空表和熱度表等。有鍋爐進水機三座，以電力轉動者二座，蒸汽　動者一座，每　容　每小時能進水十萬磅，左邊有平管爲進水總管，眞管三支，就是每座機的出口管。這機裝設於錢江的底層，水經機進人用後仍由原機送還　江。有總控制板五座，爲英國B．T．H廠製造，所有發電機，輸電綫，及廠用變壓之總開關及電表等均裝置板上，是全廠的</p>
<p>電氣樞紐</p>
<p>。有透平發電機兩座，每座七千五百開羅瓦特，蒸汽汽壓每英方寸三百五十磅，汽溫華氏七百二十度，發電機係直接連接　電方式，爲三相五十週波，一萬四千伏。有單相式變壓器三座，容重各五百開維愛，電壓爲一萬四千至六百伏，三器互相連接，用以供給全廠附屬機之電流。有附屬機配電板，全廠附　機是集中管理一切開關電表，熱表及風表都裝置在這裏。該廠</p>
<p>主要燃料</p>
<p>為煤，因此有　煤機，使燃煤磨成粉末送入鍋爐燃燒，每座每小時能磨煤六千磅，這機是用馬達拖動進煤，數量另有閘門限制它。該廠如機器全部開足，則需煤三千噸，現在燃料供應委會僅供二千噸，到南京去領，僅撥到一千四百噸，不足之數，於是衹好別求於植物油了。現在煤價爲三百九十萬元一噸，而油價需八百萬元一噸。但一噸油可抵兩噸煤，如燃油則人工等可省很多，記者問何必不全燃油？承工程師回答我，機器是限制燒煤的，故現煤與油是和合燃燒者。該廠工人透平間發電所工人約六十餘人，修理工人約六十餘八，另加外勤技工一百餘人，職員一百餘人，合共約四百餘人，工人最高的底羅爲六十元最低的爲三十元。不過該廠工人對職員視爲家人，對機廠等視　自己家裏的東西一樣，和藹親切，所以沒有什麼工潮發生。記者在邦浦Pumps間曾遇一管間工人，已鬢髮斑白，詢知乃遜淸光緒年間即在此當工人者。要勞資雙方發生感情彼此相安無事共濟時艱，只有大家開誠佈公在勞資雙方同如家人父子的原則下，一切問題都可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>杭州電廠經營的結果，收支雙方均可過得去。惟因</p>
<p>電表缺乏</p>
<p>不能裝出新戶，影響營業不少。這種電表，需自外洋購來，依近日匯價訂購二千具計算，已需國幣五十餘億元。該廠不能負荷如此鉅大　數字。</p>
<p>目前杭州電廠最切要的問題，依記者個人度之，當爲燃料與竊電兩問題，燃料困難，足以影響發電，杭市與光明之自由或將喪失，所以我們熱望北煤能打開通路，迅速南運。如不可能，我們又轉望萍鄉煤破能迅速開採，甚至黔，桂，湘，贛等處之煤藏，均能吸收游資，盡量獎勵開發，則東南工業之母之電氣事業，或更有偉大的前途。</p>
<p>竊電問題</p>
<p>：據該廠負責人吿：「現竊電佔發電總量八分之一，如以所竊之電供應用戶，可有一萬戶受到實惠。此種偸電者爲有特殊勢力的，實在無法加以制止。」我們爲了公用事業的發展，爲了使杭州市民永遠獲得光明的自由，我們有理由籲請社會各界人士予以制裁的必要！</p>
<p>杭州電廠發電的用電分配，工業約佔百分之五十五，住戶爲百分之二十五，商店爲百分之二十。照這個分配看去，杭州的工業也在滋長中，我們謹望電氣事業的發達是助長工業的擴展。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>冬防期間之　旅舍男女同房問題　情侶幽會須證明雙方之身份</h3>
<p>嚴子瑜問最近警局因時値冬防期間，檢査旅舍頗嚴。間有不法警員，意存敲詐，遇有男女同處一室者，輒曲意留難，茲有法律上疑問數則，請予答覆爲感。（一）闢室徽娼，是否雙方俱犯罪，警局有權拘禁否？（二）情侶幽會（雙方俱有正當身份證），是否犯禁，警局每予拘留，而令各該家屬保領嗎，此種措施是否合法？（三）正式配偶（包括同居人），因覓屋不得，各自寄居親戚處，假日　室歡聚，是否犯法？（四）男女朋友闢室談心，並無苟且行爲，或旅伴同室異床，警局是否可以横加劊難？（五）警員對並無犯罪行爲之人民，故意傳論或拘留，人民是否可以拒絕？應用何種方法拒絕之？</p>
<p>〔法律顧問唐鳴時先生答〕（一）闢室徵娼，如闢室徵娼之人爲孤男（即無配偶之人），而所徵之娼又為官娼（領有照會之妓女），雙方應不爲罪。（二）情侶幽會，不但呈驗雙方身份證，並須證明雙方之身份（即年齡，家屬種種）。若曠男怨女，應不犯禁。（三）正式配偶，原有同居之權利及義務，當然不爲罪。但同居渚，應歸入第二問。（四）男女談心，或旅伴同室，如無苟且行爲，自不違警。（五）以上各問情形，警察依遠　法，原可査問；若逾越　權，應負濫用職權俗及妨害自由之罪責。留難云云，或以警察之素養，敎練，未臻完善，憲法之運用，未成習慣。</p>

<h3>滬軍訓同學會成立　吳鐵城蒞臨致詞助勉有加</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕當民國二十四·二十五·二十六年時，上海市應屆高中畢業生集中受軍事訓練三個月。三年間曾受是項訓練之學生，綜計亦一萬五千餘人，全國各省籍人均有。時吳秘書長鐵城任上海市長，兼任第一屆軍訓總隊長及第二。三屆名譽總隊長。茲有當時官長學員李驤騏等發起成立同學會，於昨（廿九）日假寗波）同鄕會舉行成立大會。吳氏被邀蒞會，致詞如次：「主席，各位同學：我和諸君一別十幾年了，我曾任諸君總隊長或名譽總隊長，我永遠認爲是一件很足光榮的事。今天忽得重叙一堂，祝賀同學會的成立，尤其是感覺到高興。十幾年以前，諸君還在學生時代，受着民族意識的激發，踴躍參加集中軍訓，上海市學生曾受軍訓者先後計有一萬五千餘人，各省籍的人都有。抗日軍興，我知道很多受軍訓的同學，在各地參加抗戰，我也知道受軍訓的同學，因參加抗戰爲國捐軀者亦不少。</p>
<p>光榮的史業蹟</p>
<p>就八之役而說，我們留滬的同學有參加三十六師宋希濂部隊者，有參加八十七師工敬久部隊者，抗御外侮，戰蹟彪炳，這算得是學生軍訓歷史上最光榮的一件事。現在回想起來，還是使人興奮得了不得。我們經過了十年多的闊別，諸君已多由靑年學生時代進於服務國家社會的壯年時代了，這個時代是人生過程中最關緊要的階段。人生在這個附段，大則爲社會國家服務，小則爲個人事業的創造和發展，都是成功失敗關鍵所繫。國家社會和個人的事業，其問都有密切的關係，國家有了前途，就是我們大家有了前途。諸君在壯年的時代，尤其在今日中國多難興邦的時代，受這個時代的激發，鍛鍊越深，將來事業的成功越大。古語說：「三十而立；四十而不惑，」諸君正是在　發有爲的時候，不能不深切認識中國今日的時代，這是和諸君將來的事業成功和失敗有着很大的關係。中國人民所要求於革命的目標者，是在建設一個獨立民主自由富强康樂的三民主義的國家，中國國民黨和全國人民在過去五十多年革命述動過程中，都是朝藩這個正確的方向努力習鬥。已往歷史吿訴我們，無論遭遇著什麽艱難挫折，都能以革命的精神來克服的。倘使遭遇着艱難挫折，就惘惑苦悶，或頹唐消沈，那就不配稱革命黨員，也不是肩負偉大時代使命的愛國靑年，同時挽救不了國家向危運。</p>
<p>現在中國正面臨到歷史上嚴重的關頭，換言之，中國革命運動快到了將近成功的階段，又受到一個很大的打擊，這就是共產黨的全面叛亂。中國人民經過了八年長期的抗戰，忍受了最大的災難，勝利後需要一個和平絲一的國家，俾人民得到休養生息，政府能够集中力最，復興建設。中國共產州黨爲了要奪取政權，顚覆政府，所以要稱兵作亂，破壞中國的和平統一。政府爲了保障國家的統一和平，自有戡平叛亂的責任，所以我們要認淸楚戡亂，決不是黨爭。</p>
<p>生死兩條路</p>
<p>中國的人民，尤其是中國智識的靑年，在國家治亂興衰的嚴重關頭，所走的道路要認識淸楚，現在中國只有生死兩條路，生路就是三民主義救國建國的大道，死路就是禍國殃民流寇式的共匪所走的路綫。如果走了錯路，中國就淪爲極權政治國家的一部份，好像今日東歐附庸國家的情形一樣。除此以外沒有，也不容許有第三條道路。所謂中間路綫，實即是徘徊徬徨的歧途，卽是等死的路。何况現在有一部份倡導中間　綫的人們，是無形中受了共產黨　利用，來分化肢解中國革命的力量而不悟的。</p>
<p>中國的革命復興建設，已不容再因循耽誤。回顧民國成立卅七年以來，中國已經錯過了兩次復興建設最好的機會了：第一，辛亥革命成功後，如果不是袁世凱等軍閥封建殘餘的勢力，造成毀法亂紀內戰連年，肌碍了中國和平統一建設，那麼中國的民主政治，一定會早走上了正軌；第二，民國十五年國民革命軍北伐成功，摧毀軍閥官僚的封建殘餘的勢力，促成中國的絲一，中國又轉入一個新　氣運，如果當年不是共產黨盤踞江西，稱兵作亂，及日本帝國主義的侵略，引起八年長期的抗戰，中國除舊佈新的建設，也可以奠定其基礎。</p>
<p>復興好機會</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以后，應該是中國第三次復興建設的機會了。不平等條約的取消，國際地位因以增高，政府和人民都在熱切求治的時候，這眞是千載難逢轉捩國運好機會。共匪明白這個機會的存在，是和他的用心企圖很不利的，所以多方破壞和平絲一，甚至發動全而叛變，這是中國的不幸，人民的不幸。</p>
<p>中國人民要集中力量，把握這一次國家民族復興建設的良機，不要一誤再誤，再給牠破壞了，喪失了。我們不但要爭取今天，而且要爭取明天，換言之，不能只顧到現在，還要顧到將來。中國的希望，在今日中國愛國靑年的身上，我們要號召有智識的靑年，在中國當前唯一的領袖蔣主席領導之下團結起來充實革命的力量，把握住這個復興建設的良機，早日戡平叛亂，完成國家的和平統一，鞏固民主自由的基礎；這樣才能够確保民生安定，國家建設。諸君都是在壯年有爲的時候，又是在社會各階層的中堅份子，應該先團結起來，號召全國靑年，參加戡亂建國的工作，完成國民革命的使命，我們要時時共同警惕，相互勗勉。」吳氏詞畢，大會即開始討論會章並通過該會理事李驤騏，葛明達，張心宇，朱振國，吳世昌等卅一人，監事陶一珊，李子祥等九人。末宣讀上主席致敬電後散會。原電如下：「主席蔣鈞鑒。遡維鈞座領導革命，綰國　機，始之以北伐，繩之以抗戰，統率元戎，迭奏膚凱。遊國步之艱維，俱瞻宏濟，拯生靈於水火，成慶來蘇。邇復戡亂方殷，紋寗有待，頣此餘寇，豈任跳梁？舉國人民，同深憤慨！學生等壘　敎戰，寗辭請纓，爲一精誠，爰謀聯誼，使我袍澤，咸獲聲應氣求，俾效馳驅，共策戡亂建國。肅　致敬，仰祈睿鑒。上海市學校軍訓回學會成立大會叩，艷印。」</p>

<h3>臺煤的新生與扶植</h3>
<p>新礦區在試探中</p>
<p>毫灣的煤田是偏在北部的，自基隆起至新竹縣大安溪止，南北綫百長達一百六十公里，面積雖頗廣大，地層變動却極劇烈，走向亦至不一致，每一層的厚度，最多僅有三英呎左右，而平均厚度，更僅有一英呎半左右，每層之間，復夾以岩層數十公呎，此稱天然的限制，就可以說明開采工作的困難。而礦區亦極零星分散，最大的礦僅能月產八千公噸，最少者月產僅三五十噸，與東北華北大破相比，顯得格外藐小。所以堂省月產煤十餘萬噸，煤礦就多至二百餘單位，在此情形下，充分採用近代機械化的生產方法，自屬不可能之事。採煤區域，自日治時代以迄現在，集中於毫北縣區（包括基隆瑞芳），多數煤田經過百年探採，平坑有深至千公尺以上的，深斜坑有長達三千公尺以上的，在規模藐小無法利用機械設備下，此等老坑生產，殆難避免日益萎縮的運命。因此，建設廳已籌撥款項，與地質硏究所合作探測新竹礦區，並同時作試探性的生產。祗是煤礦開發，非短期內可以奏功，至少須在一年後，方可望自新礦取得供應。目前建應對於煤礦的政策是一面開發新礦，</p>
<p>一面就原有礦坑積極增產的雙管齊下。</p>
<p>因爲就原有礦坑積極生產，扶植礦商的任務，成爲極端重要。這任務現由直屬省府的石炭調整委員會完全担負，其職掌爲配合燃料管制政策，辦理統購統銷業務，寓扶植於調整工作之中。記者曾訪問該會負責人，叩以有關生產扶植問題。據稱該會之工作，除調節供需外，對小礦業者儘量予以保障協助，其與增進生產有關的主要業務可分爲三項；</p>
<p>（一）煤價的開整：煤價可分內銷外銷兩種，內銷價格，即爲收購價格，每噸加　幣二百元（此二百元爲管理費）收購價格乃根據業者之實際成本，加百分之三十至四十之利潤而決定，每次調整價格之根據，以儘量採　煤礦業公會之意見爲原則，最近收購價格，特級煤層每噸已增爲臺幣一萬一千元，至外銷價格完全由上海燃管會決定，所有外銷煤斤盈餘，石炭會除提取百分之五爲管理費外，全部分配與煤礦業者，此項辦法，自去年十二”起即開始實施。</p>
<p>（二）器材的供應：在此方面該會亦曾盡相當努力。臺省煤礦最缺乏者，爲無烟安全炸藥，此外如機械設備，鍋　鋼軌等，亦亟待都充，該會於去年底曾向中央銀行借得美金外匯十萬元，爲購買炸藥之用，本年春間可以購到，供全年之用，所差無一幾。鋼索鋼軌亦多　設法收購，隨時平價分配與民營煤礦，使不致因器材缺乏而阻礙生產。（未完）</p>

<h3>民間科工合作問題的檢討</h3>
<p>— 張季言</p>
<p>讀一月二十六日大公報，盧于道君『民間科工的合作』一文，不禁深佩廬君的高瞻遠矚，語重心長，引起同情的共鳴，提出響應的呼聲。</p>
<p>在烽烟遍地，民不聊生的現狀下，科學工作者本來未會得政府的積極獎勵，目前偏重軍事時期，自然更無望於短期內有所改進；於此時提倡民間科工的合作，確是今日國內科學工作者苦悶中的唯一出路。</p>
<p>如何提倡民間科工的合作呢？筆者僅就管見所及，先略談一二，以爲引玉之磗，希望科學界先進，共同起來討論，發表更具體，更高明的意見。普及民間的科學知識</p>
<p>普及民間的科學知識</p>
<p>今日國內的民間，雖已不是三十年前的民間，受過科學訓練的工業家，比比皆是。然而這不過是較大都市的一部份，全國廣大地區的民間，對於科學還是茫無所知，這固然是由於敎肯尙未普及的原因，但科學知識的普及於民間，無疑的，較救育普及之僅在掃除文盲和提倡識字運動更難，至少在中等學校以上的學生，方能從事於科學的硏討。因此，科學工作者和民間，似乎還隔着一條鴻溝，若干科學刋物，能合於一般民衆閱讀的，還是很少；有的都只是專門科學者方能閱讀。可見大多數的民衆，根本還不知道有所謂科學，要提倡民間科工合作，我們科學工作者，此後還須接近民衆，深人民間，用綫近的宣傳材料，使民間對科學知識，由認識而發生興趣。</p>
<p>促起工業界對於科學的認識</p>
<p>從原子時代開始以後，地球的遠桂已經縮短，天下一家的觀念，日益接近，工商業國際競爭的優勝劣敗，也日益明顯，我國的工業生產品，如果再不用科學的方法求改進，在人工和原料的成本，不能與人家相比，豈惟將來無法和外貨競爭，簡直有淘汰和無法存在的危險。現在，除了較大都市中少數工業界，有受過科學訓練的人才以外，整個的工業界中，對於用科學方法改進工業生產的認識，還是不普遍。所以國內的科學工作者，在政府還不能獎勵扶植私人硏究之時，還是向工業界貢獻所得，引起工業界普遍的對科學有了認識，然後可以進一步繼續硏究工作。使科學家與工業界發生密切的合作。</p>
<p>引致工業界投資科學硏究工作</p>
<p>因了通貨膨脹，引起市面上的游資充斥，形成經濟的不安定，相反的，投資於工業生產方面却只有减少，這原因也是工業方面爲了人工與原料有許多問題，生產品本成太高，無法獲利，因而對投資不感多大興趣，但這樣一往不返，對我國工業前途，是很危險的。要解決這一問題，便是如何增加生產，减輕成本，實有賴於科學上的硏究發明，國內不是沒有科學天才的發明家，也不愁沒有原料，只是研究發明，需要相當的時間與經濟，如果工業界眼光放遠，能聯合投資於科學的硏究丁作上，像外國一樣的集合工業資本家的龐大資本，設立大規模的科學硏究實騐室，相信將來發明的成績，在工業上一定有　人的價値。則我國工業的前途，和國家科學發展的前途，希望是很大的。</p>
<p>儘先成立實騐室</p>
<p>我國國內著名的科學圈體，原也不少，其中尤以中國科學社，中華學藝社，中華自然科學社等幾個單位，各有悠久的歷史，各攤有國內優秀的科學專家，可是整個團體在平時和民間工業界少有聯絡，因此多數科學專家，在經濟條件之下，不但不能像外國科學家的各個都有私人硏究室，而且要想由團體設立幾個實騐研究室，都還因經費等等問題，離成功尙遠。所以在提倡民間科工合作的口號之下，一方面希望擁有很多科學專家的科學團體，此後多與民間工業團體密切聯絡，一方面希望有遠大眼光的民間工業界，就原有成績表現的科學團體的研究計劃，和現有的科學專家，相互合作，供給資本，儘先成立各個硏究實騐室。</p>
<p>總之，在月前國家財力還不能專注到科學研究方面之時，惟有如此，旣可使國內科學工作者不致興「無所用」之　，復可使民間工業界在未來的危機中，有開關生路的希望，科學與工業，原是密切有關，相需而成的。讓我們大家趕快來喚起「民間科工合作的口號，並共同來促其實現！</p>
<h3>日月潭頭之水塔</h3>
<h3>意外的科學發明</h3>
<p>— 葉鐳</p>
<p>糖精</p>
<p>法爾寶（C.Fahlberg）在實騐室裏整整的工作了一天，肚子餓了，沒有洗手，匆忙地拿起麵包就吃。說也奇怪，這時所吃的麴包，比平時所吃的，特別要甜些。因爲他急於要再去做他的試驗，吃得很快，所以在吃的時候，沒有注意。</p>
<p>麵包吃完了，他去盛一杯開水來喝。這時，他看見自己的手，很是骯髒；於是想起剛在吃到的特別甜味，便嚐嚐自己的手和吃麵包時拿過的東西，知道這甜味，是從自己骯髒的手上來的；而這手上的骯髒，是在做試騐的時候，被藥品染上的，因此立刻去檢査試騐時用過的藥品，結果發明一種非常甜的新物質，呌做「糖精」（Saccharin）</p>
<p>電木</p>
<p>夜，白克闌博士（Ｄr.L.Baekeland）的實騐室中，有一雙懶惰的貓，要想倫吃，跳上藥架，把一瓶蟻醛的水溶液翻倒；那隻貓被嚇得逃走了。在這瓶蟻醛水溶液的下面，恰巧有一個捕鼠機，裏而放着香味濃郁的乳酪，用來引誘老鼠。蟻醛的水溶液，倒在上而，立刻起了變化，產生一種堅硬的新物質。</p>
<p>第二天早上，白克蘭博士看見這新物質，很是詫異。檢査後，方才知道這是蟻醛的水溶液和乳酪化合而成的。他想如此堅硬的東西，一定可以用來製造日常用具，於是引起了硏究的動機，結果發明『電木』（Ｂakelite）</p>
<p>不銹鋼</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰的時候，布力阿萊（H.Brearley）要想鍛鍊一種非常堅硬的鋼鐵，用來製造槍砲，不怕麻煩，一次又一次的去把鉻和鋼鐵混合起來，放進爐中鍜鍊試騐。但是鍊出來的鉻鋼，都不甚堅硬，當時他毫不在乎，便把它丟棄了。</p>
<p>後來有一天，他的助手正在淸除堆積着的垃圾，忽然看見一些亮晶晶的東西，雜在這垃圾堆中，拾起來一看，原來是從前丟了的鉻鋼。他想鋼鐵在這樣潮濕的垃圾堆中，本來要生銹的，現在鉻鋼還沒有生銹，那末把鉻混在鋼鐵裏，一定可以防止生銹。因此專心研究，發明了「不銹鋼」（StaiulessSteel）。</p>
<p>盤尼西林</p>
<p>遠在十九年前，有一天，富拉明Prol.AlexanderFleming）敎授正在培養着葡萄狀的球菌，忽然從窗外飛進一個靑黴種子的小芽胞，落在一隻培養皿中。或許因爲靑黴是常見的，富拉明敎授當時沒有把它除去。後來，這隻小芽胞慢慢地長成一個車輸狀的靑黴，並且分泌出一種神奇的新物質，把附近葡萄狀的球菌，有的殺死了，有的征服得不能動彈了。</p>
<p>當拉明敎授發見了這種新晢物，很是興奮；便把那雙青黴，放在與汁中培養起來，結果證明它所分泌的神奇新物質，的確有殺　效力。於是和許多學者，共同繼續研究，經過了十多年，到一九四〇年，才由阿孛拉哈姆（Aorauam）等，把它精製出來，質獻給醫藥上使用，不知救了多少病人。這種新藥品，名呌『配尼西林』（Penicillin）。</p>
<p>科學的發明，有些是偶然的,這齣確是發明家的幸運，但是發明家能够把握這個幸運，專心硏究，都是由於平日硏究有素，是偶然的，却又不是偶然的。</p>
<h3>臺灣日月潭水電廠</h3>
<p>— H.K.周</p>
<p>彎曲得像黄蛇般的公路，從山麗一直蜿蜓進云端裏，連汽車也爬得喘不過氣來的時候，你一定以爲到了單調寂寞的山巔，可是展開在你前面的却是一片湖山秀色—日月潭。你能料想到在這海拔七百四十五公尺的高山上，會有如此美麗的一片「西湖」嗎？</p>
<p>日月潭並不像西潮那模樣，僅僅只有美麗的風景，如同中國的古典美人；也不像美國的尼亞加拉瀑布，僅僅只有水力，如同十八世紀的古典科學家。她却兩者兼備，就好像是一位新時代前進的女性。日月潭並非完全天然湖，也非完全人工湖。却也是二者兼而有之。它是在二百七十三年前被高山族呌做卜吉的所發現。當時湖水最深處僅二十七公尺。周圍是二十四公里，後來日人發覺可利用它的地勢來發電。於是就興工建築水利工程，將周圍的山凹裏都築起堤來，把四周山上的水都導入湖裏。於是整個山谷都成了湖泊，水位因此升高七十公尺。周圍擴大到三十公尺，許多山峯都沒入潮裏。於是在距日月潭十九公里的地方建築了大觀發電廠，用五條大水管將水從日月潭導下來，利用水的位能，推動了能發電二瓩萬以上。電壓在一萬伏特以上的巨大發電機五座。又將大觀發電廠用過的水，再第二次利用地勢發電，於是在距大觀八公里地勢更低的水裏坑，建築了鉅工發電廠。用兩根大水管的水發電。再把兩個廠的發的電會合起來，分送到全台各地。</p>
<p>日月潭的水利工程設備十分完善，不受雨量的影響，水位可以自由調節。水位升降可達五十公尺之鉅。二月間水位最高，四五月間水位最低，故終年可以發電。發電機與出水口也有特殊設備。裝有自動調節器，使電壓與電流十分均勻，據廠方報吿，現在一共可發電十六萬瓩左右。臺灣一省使用尙有剩餘。最近高雄鋁廠開工後，或</p>
<p>坐在台灣的火車裏，往窗外望去，就可以看見工程浩大的送電高壓綫，它的電壓在四萬代特以上呢！（　　本期播圖）</p>

<h3>家庭簡易科學實騐記</h3>
<p>— 劉遂生</p>
<p>白日旣匿，華燈初上，余與家人，圍爐而坐，共活天倫樂事，興盡之餘，乃乃乃從事科學實驗以消遣。</p>
<p>其時余　方一枝在手，白烟繚繞，直向爐之上方吹去。銦兒問其故，餘妾答以爐上空氣遇熱上升，冷空氣飛來塡空。例如天氣突熱，凉風隨至。此一實驗，即明示風之起因。</p>
<p>錮兒玩熱水，兩手淋漓。余曰：來！移手近爐火。同時命鐳兒取紙扇來，對手揮　，將爐上暖氣吹至銦兒手上。銦兒說：一手乾以前，覺着凉爽；乾燥以後，始覺溫暖。」余曰：「此種實驗，明示呼吸作用或出汗　後，能保持身體凉爽</p>
<p>兒玩砂，有小鉛桶兩隻。一隻　砂，另隻盛水。置於爐上，加熱至同一溫度後，移　桌上。命鐳兒不時測其溫度，據稱溫度低降，以砂爲速。余妻笑問余曰：「這又明示什麽？」余曰：「砂代大陸，水表海洋，此即明示大陸氣候，變化急劇，海洋氣候，比較平和。」</p>
<p>余妻持剪，剪紙人二。命鐳兒將一紙人，盡涂墨汁，其一則否，另將兩小旗，分別用燭油沾於兩紙人手上。對立於燭火兩側。移時，黑人手中之旗先落。此實明示黑色吸熱較易，故久天衣着宜黑色，夏天宜白也。</p>
<p>銦兒用鋁杯取冰水來。余加入食監，令其用筷攪拌。復命鐳兒挿一寒暑表，未幾杯外　露珠，測得度數，是爲露點，亦卽表示下雨和露水現出的時候。</p>
<p>鐳兒取大玻瓶一隻，以着火的紙片投入，急寫以有竹管之木塞。用口吹氣或吸氣，則烟　升沉；是囚壓力增加或减低，烟乃升沉，是以覩炊烟之横飛與直升，知風暴之來否。</p>
<p>關於氣象方面的簡易實驗，暫吿中止。鐳兒忽稱：「我們的敎師說科學實驗，應進科學倌。</p>
<p>一余曰：「自然科學以物質爲對象；人不能離物質而生活，即隨時隨地皆科學實驗材料，初不限於科學館中。科學敎育若僅爲學校的裝飾品，而不能深人民問，此余所以爲中國科學前途　愛也</p>
<p>實驗旣畢，相親而笑，更　已邋，相階就寢。次日執筆，作「家庭簡易科學實驗記。」</p>

<h3>論「職業反對家」</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>智識份子這一稱呼，最近似乎又頗被人重視了。在司徒大使的告我國人民書中，就曾這樣表示說：「中國智識份子茍能成立進步團　，以激勵政府決策，則和平當可增進。」</p>
<p>司徒大使　幾句話，以及他全篇言論的要點，不外是前年馬歇爾將軍離華時那篇宣言的引伸，因爲當時馬將軍亦曾表示過中國的前途，祗有寄託在智識份子與政府的合作基礎上，馬將軍似乎還在智識份子的上面加了一個「開明與進步一的弧號。</p>
<p>不過這次司徒大使的談話，似乎更進一步，表示現在的政府與智識份子間，頗多隔閡，因此又引出了新開局長　顯光的一篇辯正，大意是說司徒大使雖深悉我國敎育界的情形，但說政府與智識份子不能合作，則未免言之過甚。並指出中國的多數智識份子均與政府合作，雖間有對政府的措置未能表示同情者，但一聯業的反對家」各國皆有之，並不能因此證明中國的智識份子不與政府合作，</p>
<p>中國的智識份子竟會受到這樣的國內外重視，恐怕不免要感到有些受寵若驚吧。因爲眼前的中國智識份子，在物質和精神生活雙方，都是在空前苦難的時期中，而現在居然爲友邦矚目，政府重視，以爲中國未來的命運，必須寄託在他們身上，豈非要使他們感到驚奇嗎？</p>
<p>不過我個人是早就說過的，一國的智識份子不論遭受某一時代社會怎樣的輕視，到頭來還是少不了他們的。這並不是爲智識份子吹噓，試看就是在提倡階級專政的國家中，其開始以及最後的領導權，又何嘗能逃出智識份子的手黨？從經濟生活將人分類，也許每一個個人都可以歸屬到某一個階級去，獨有智識份子却不然。</p>
<p>智　份子也許可能有所謂階級意識，但實際上並不重要，因爲祗要一朝權力在手，智識的力量就會蓋過階級意識的。蘇聯就是一個例子。蘇聯是號稱無產階級革命的國家，但領導這一革命的人實際上是少數的智識份子。就是無產階級革命的一套理論，也是出於少數智識份子的幻想。你能相信農奴解放後不久的俄國農民，會有甚麼無產階級革命意識嗎？而今日蘇聯的一切行動，也決不是保衛甚麼「無產階級祖國」的利益，而恰是和別的國家的領導層智識份子一樣，祗是爲普通的國家利益打算而已。</p>
<p>據我看，智識份子祗有在朝與在野的分別。在朝的智識份子，也就是所謂與政府合作的那一單，而在野的一批，那即是簫伯納所稱的「職業反對家」了。如果我的觀察不錯，則美國一部份輿論所指摘的中國智識份子尙與政府有所隔閡，僅是指的那輩「職業反對家」而已。</p>
<p>然而你要把所有的智識份子都統一在「一條陣綫」內，不僅是辦不到，而且也無此必要。說句實話，所謂民主與不民主的分野，即在某一國的政府對於「職業反對家」能有多少容忍的「雅量」，而且不在乎擴大政府基礎到容納所有的智識份子。</p>
<p>譬如拿美國來說，美國的所以稱爲民主國家，並不是說美國的政府基礎是建築在美國智識份子的統一陣綫上，而是因爲美國政府尙有容納如華萊士一輩人批評政府的雅量。可是對於美國的共產黨，則雖然民主如美國政府，其容納的態度亦有限度。但這決非有損美國在朝派智識份子的民主精神。何故？因爲美國的在朝智識份子深知如果讓美國的共產黨和他們對調一下地位，則就連華萊士那輩人恐怕也無存在餘地了。</p>
<p>當前中國智識份子的問題，也並不在怎樣能使全部在野的「職業反對家」在朝，而是在於有沒有容納「職業反對家」的雅量。而這一點，也恐怕正就是眼前一部份美國輿論對中國的要求。銅</p>

<h3>二十年前之袁寒雲</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>民國七年之冬，有大文豪袁寒雲君，與鄙人相遇於北都，一見如故交，談文論字，情至愉快。一日，袁置酒邀鄙人飲，步林屋朱　靑徐淩霄三君皆在座，寒　着玉色長袍，手擺羅漢念珠，面潔白如玉，風流瀇灑，一翩翩　世佳公子也。旣復伸紙在牀沿作畏聯，憑空攬紙，筆不停揮，字字力勁氣遒，洵非他人所能及。</p>
<p>酒半，寒雲出听藏宋板魚二機詩集，囑衆人題詠，鄙人分韻得雪字，即口占云：「鳳羅屛緣飛瓊層，鮫綃錦碧凝春雪，嫣紅粉暈疑入神，緗雲絲　女郞血；千秋殘帙雖不食，楮光陸離字香冽，夜深拂花時一吟，似聽股勤認聲咽。」爲寫　集後，當時題首頗多。集首在印章曰「皋二子」，余謂寒雲，君陮人，　印近謔，何謂也？寒雲乃出其所著詩云：「乍著微綿强自勝，古　荒檻一憑陸，　飛太液心無住，雲起魔厓夢欲勝。偶向遠林聞遠笛，獨臨靈室轉明燈，絕憐高處多風雨，莫到瓊樓最上層。」末一聯，即表明不能稱帝之意，以之力勸其父而不能省，且其長兄，一力主張無安進行，自謂皇儲穩穩到手，因寒雲著詩規勸，鼓吹反對，仇恨愈深，幾欲演出陳思王煮豆燃萁之事，賴有此印，表明一致，遂得全身，當時局外人固未能深悉其中底蘊也。</p>
<p>寒雲書法，尤爲傑出，瘦硬通神，能鎔古篆藉爲一爐而冶之。曾以論書一札，寄示鄙人，書云：「書法始於篆學，學書者必以篆始。篆書體畫整肅，行白謹嚴，習之而後攻他，庶免弱俗荒斜之病。篆法旣盡，乃以隸體宕之，學隸當取西漢諸碑，東遷以降，多尙側媚，古意漸疏矣。進參以古草，極縱横轉折之勢，探書之源，立書之本，以六朝楷法束之而書成矣。六朝之書，尤推北魏碑誌，所見隸姿篆骨，允爲楷之宗法，若鐘王之書，誠盡善盡美者也，其楷書傳世者，惜多見於帖，帖爲鉤摹而成者，縱有佳工，亦難完其神髓，碑誌則書於石刋者，得守其原，無或微失，故取六朝之眞，棄鐘王之僞。隋唐碑誌，良有佳構，流覽可耳。宋元人書，日趨婉媚，以鋒芒勝，不宜人石，墨本猶有可觀者。明人側露益甚，間隊妖鄙。淸士困於帖括，不可超拔，故書多拘陋。然此特泛言耳，若奇突之士，不惑俗流，窺古人之堂奧而自成一家者，代尙有其人焉。奪篆隸之眞魄，與西京抗手，千百年中一何道州耳。唐以後，名家之書，供參玩則可，用爲師法，則未足也。世人舍本務末，或臨三希堂，或摹覃溪石庵輩，稍獲貌似，即以書家自許，倘知法東坡山谷松雪香光諸家，則更以高古傲人，求知六朝者已鮮，遑論三代秦漢矣。古法淪墜，復何言哉！」於淸代，獨推崇何子貞，不爲無見。數年闊別，窮老盡氣，未幾，即聞其歿於海上，而所遺翰墨亦不多見，良可惋惜。</p>
<p>日寇方張時，鄙人避居來滬，偶與老友靜齋，在冷籌攤中，得有寒雲日記二册，印刷精美，書法遒勁，於詩詞各體外，尤精撰聯，誠屬佳本，聯想及於項城當國，如日之方中，袁頭銀幣，信用昭著，窮鄕僻壤，普遍通行，民心漸覺安定，惜乎帝慾驟張，大業崩潰，生民尤復　鄭不安。古云萬法唯心，一心之轉，安危立見，關係誠不小耳。</p>

        <h1>1948.03.01</h1>
<h3>Chairman Discusses with Zhang Zuoxiang and Others, Decides to Dispatch Large Troops to Pass Through the Border to Reinforce the Northeast; People from Northeast Living in Beijing Appeal for Saving Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Chairman Jiang on the 29th formally expressed to the Northeast envoys that the central government will absolutely and consistently implement the policy of never abandoning the Northeast. This statement has deeply impressed and moved those who came to pay their respects, and strengthened their confidence. Chairman Jiang summoned Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, and Zou Zuohua at 12:30 AM on the 29th, accompanied by Mo Dehui and Liu Zhe. The Chairman hosted a luncheon, with Chen BuLei from the Presidential Office, Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, Chen Fangzhong, Director of the Political Affairs Bureau, and Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, as guests. During the meal, Zhang, Wan, Ma, and Zou respectively explained the current situation in the Northeast, especially the current crisis and the urgent problems to be solved, involving both domestic and foreign affairs. They believe that the Northeast is currently facing unprecedented difficulties, but it is not impossible to save it. There are two reasons for this: First, the brutal crimes of the Communist bandits in various parts of the Northeast are even worse than the vicious methods used during the Japanese rule; second, the Communist bandits do not yet have a deep foundation in the Northeast, and currently only rely on terrorist policies to maintain their temporary control, while the people of the Northeast are irreconcilable with the Communist bandits. With these two reasons, the difficulties in the Northeast can still be resolved. They suggested two things: (1) Expedite the dispatch of large troops to reinforce the Northeast, secure existing strongholds, and actively open up transportation lines; (2) Effectively use the manpower and material resources of the Northeast to assist the national army in combat, while organizing the masses to strengthen local armed forces and penetrate deep behind enemy lines. After Zhang and others finished their report, the Chairman immediately stated that the government has long been determined to defend the Northeast, and this is a consistent policy of the central government that will never be changed. The existing military strongholds will be firmly defended by the national army, which is not a problem, and transportation lines will be actively opened up in the future. As for using local manpower and material resources to strengthen local armed forces and penetrate deep behind enemy lines, the Chairman expressed great appreciation. After Zhang, Wan, Ma, and Zou left, they were extremely optimistic about the Chairman's decisive command and well-organized deployment, and they all believed that with the Chairman's determination, the Northeast would definitely have a solution.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Compatriots from the nine provinces and three cities of the Northeast living in Beijing issued a declaration on the 29th regarding the Northeast crisis. The following is a brief record: We, the compatriots, in order to rescue our hometown, to defend our motherland, and to fulfill our human duty, hereby put forward the following urgent appeals: (1) Demand that the government immediately dispatch large troops to ensure the existing strongholds in the Northeast, open up important transportation lines, and reverse the entire war situation; (2) Demand that the government airlift a large amount of food to supply the Northeast military and civilians; (3) Demand that the government reform the Northeast currency system, determine the exchange rate between the circulating currency and the legal tender, and allow parallel use and free exchange; (4) Demand that the government quickly organize and equip the knowledgeable youth and strong refugees in Pan Yang and other places; (5) Demand that the government mobilize the maximum manpower, material resources, and financial resources to defend the Great Northeast; (6) Demand that the Northeast compatriots widely launch a movement to rescue their hometown and defend their motherland; (7) Save the Northeast from danger and consolidate the national defense front line; (8) Demand that the Soviet Union immediately fulfill its treaty obligations and assist the government in taking over the entire Northeast administration, otherwise, please ask the government to declare the abolition of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and implement a severance of relations with the Soviet Union, and file a complaint with the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Northeast Nine Provinces and Three Cities Association in Beijing held a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 29th to welcome the Northeast envoys Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Zhang Yuanfu, and Han Junjie, Chairman of Heilongjiang, who came to Beijing to report on their duties, presided over by Yu Bin. First, he delivered a welcome speech, then invited Zhang and others to report and the compatriots to speak freely. After that, the Compatriots Association immediately read out the declaration. The tea party lasted for more than two hours, and the atmosphere at the venue was always enthusiastic and grief-stricken, with a strong sense of unity. When Zhang Zuoxiang spoke, he pointed out two points to explain the current situation in the Northeast: (1) The military situation in the Northeast has not stopped for the past two and a half years, and it has become increasingly serious, which is actually related to diplomacy; (2) The reason why the Northeast problem has evolved to the present situation is that manpower and financial resources have not been properly used. He also immediately stated that they were summoned to come this time and have no preconceived notions. Wan expressed that the Northeast compatriots are in deep suffering, and they were specially ordered to come and report. Ma said: "The current seriousness of the Northeast has far exceeded the time of the 'September 18th Incident' and the 'July 7th Incident'. We are deeply afraid that this time we fled, we will not know when we will be able to return? We must use our own strength to save ourselves, otherwise, relying on others, there will be a danger of destruction." Zou specially explained the importance of organization and unity, and Zhang Yuanfu also agreed with this view. When Han Junjie spoke, he was in tears, expressing that he personally failed the country and his fellow villagers, and that he had retreated step by step for more than two years, and he had seen too much heartache everywhere! However, due to various constraints, it was almost impossible for us to say a word or ask a question. Han continued to briefly explain the suffering of the people in the Northeast and the destruction of the Communist bandits. Finally, some fellow villagers, such as Qi Yu, proposed to employ Northeast people to investigate and accept corrupt elements, and to promote young people.</p>
<h3>Part of the Industrial Equipment in the Northeast is Evacuated to Guan Nei; The Resource Commission Plans to Increase Coal Production in South China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Senior officials of the Northeast units of the Resource Commission are all in Ping. After Sun Yueqi met with them yesterday, a decision has been generally made on the disposal of industrial equipment in the Northeast. In principle, units that should not be evacuated will be maintained until the end, those that have been occupied will be liquidated within two months, and those that have been evacuated will be distributed to Central China, South China, and Taiwan, and a part will also be sent to North China. The current situation of each unit is maintained by local employees, while one or two senior officials are left to preside over the work. Almost all of the personnel sent to Guanwai to take over have been withdrawn and replaced by local people. The current status of the existing units is as follows: (1) Benxi Coal Mine: Currently presided over by Tian Yuxing, Deputy Director of the Accounting Department, it can still produce 2,000 tons of coal per day, 300 tons of coke, and produce a small amount of special steel for military needs, generating 12,000 kilowatts of electricity. Isolated from the outside world, employees mainly eat bean cakes and sugar. Because it was once occupied by workers, management felt it was difficult, so more than 40 technicians and more than 60 clerks were evacuated, along with about 200 family members, who are all in Ping now. (2) Northeast Metal Mining Company: This company, which was formed by the merger of 64 units, is already at a dead end after Andong was lost. Currently, only the Pan Yang Smelter still produces a small amount of copper skin to supply the military, with about 140 employees. (3) Northeast Cement Company: Originally, six institutions were taken over, two of which were operating, Liaoyang Xiaotun and Benxi. Now Liaoyang has been lost, and Benxi is also trapped, so the products have no way out and production has stopped. The Benxi factory is presided over by Shao Kequan, the acting chief of the engineering section, and the Pan Yang General Company is responsible for the director of the general affairs department, Chuan Qiutou. (4) The Liaoyang, Dalinghe, and Yingkou factories belonging to the Liaoning Paper Company have all been lost. More than a dozen technicians have been evacuated to Ping, living by selling rubber materials. Senior staff will be sent to Taiwan, and one or two will go to Tianjin to work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] In order to develop coal mines in South China, the Resource Commission established the Ganxi (Gaokeng, Jiangxi), Huxiang, Xiangjiang, Zhongxiang (all in Xiangtan, Hunan), Yongshao (Shaoyang, Hunan), Xiangyong (Yongxing, Hunan), and Nanling (northern Guangdong) coal mines in the three provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong last year. However, due to the low output, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places still need Shanghai to transport coal to supply them. Recently, there is no hope of transporting coal from the Northeast, and the Kailuan coal mine cannot be transported to the south due to the interruption of the Beining Railway. The coal used in East China and South China now only relies on Huainan, East China and Taiwan. The coal production is not very large, so the Resource Commission has drafted a plan to increase coal production in South China. The content is as follows: (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] According to Hong Kong News: In the past two months, the average daily sales of US dollar drafts by various banks and exchange shops have reached approximately US$50,000 to US$100,000. The number of US dollars traded on the black market is also between US$30,000 and US$40,000. There is also considerable trading in futures US dollars. There are approximately three sources of US dollars: (A) brought back by overseas Chinese, (B) brought by wealthy people from Shanghai, (C) used by sailors of the US fleet visiting Hong Kong.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 29th] The newly appointed Mayor of Pan Yang, Dong Wenqi, took office on the 1st. He said that the situation is much more difficult than when he took over, and he will only encourage his colleagues to work hard and say less.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] Chairman Liang Huasheng of Jilin arrived in Changchun today by special plane and will preside over the handover ceremony of the new and old mayors here on March 1st.

The rumor that the US fleet will hold large-scale exercises between the Sea of Japan and Qingdao is a rumor, and the US has also denied it. It is reported that the fleet is scheduled to depart from Qingdao on the 1st and visit ports in Singapore, Ceylon, and the Persian Gulf. It will pass through the Suez Canal and go straight to Port of Spain, Trinidad, and return to San Diego after May via Panama.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning to the Philippines Face Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 28th] Overseas Chinese holding re-entry permits issued by the Philippine government in 1941 will be allowed to return to the Philippines. In addition, approximately 2,500 overseas Chinese who left the Philippines between 1937 and 1940 will not be allowed to enter the country. This is the result of negotiations between Philippine Immigration Commissioner Fabre and Clark, the head of the Hong Kong office of the International Refugee Organization, last week. Clark recently arrived here from Hong Kong to enable 2,000 Chinese from the pre-war Philippine Islands to return to the Philippine Islands. These Chinese relied on the relief of the International Refugee Organization while stranded in Xiamen to maintain their lives. Mr. Clark is now leaving here for Hong Kong, where he will submit a report to the headquarters of the International Refugee Organization in Geneva on the results of his mission. It is reported that the 2,500 Chinese who are prohibited from returning to the Philippines collectively can enter the country in succession in accordance with the "Regulations on the Quota of Foreign Nationals Entering the Philippines," which stipulates that 500 Chinese can enter the country each year as temporary tourists or students.</p>
<h3>Eight Commissioners and County Magistrates in Jin Province Sacrificed in the Yuncheng Campaign</h3>

<h3>Supervisors Recommend that the Executive Yuan Increase Resources for the Northeast; Inspection Procedures for Overseas Chinese Ships in Xiamen and Haikou Should be Simplified</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Gu Fengxiang, the supervisor of the Liaoning, Andong, and Liaobei supervisory districts of the Supervisory Yuan, recommended that the Executive Yuan increase resources for the Northeast to meet urgent needs. This recommendation was issued by the Supervisory Yuan yesterday. Among the impeachment and corrective recommendations issued by the Supervisory Yuan yesterday, there was also a recommendation by Supervisor Qin Wangshan to the Executive Yuan to simplify the inspection procedures for overseas Chinese ships in Xiamen and Haikou to avoid harassment. Qin Wangshan recommended that the Executive Yuan establish an agency in Xiamen to manage overseas Chinese passports to facilitate overseas development. Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting provided five recommendations to the Executive Yuan on various economic measures in North China. Xing Senzhou recommended that the Executive Yuan adopt decision-making plans for diplomacy. Mei Gongren recommended that the Ministry of National Defense provide five suggestions on the strategy for suppressing bandits.

In addition, Fang Zhaogao, Director of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, was impeached by Supervisor Li Zhengle.</p>
<h3>National Army Continues to Search the East Bank of the Liao River; The Battle Situation in West Shenyang Turns Stable; Communist 7th Column Attacked Xinmin Fiercely but Failed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Fan Hanjie arrived in Ping from Beijing yesterday, carrying orders from the Chairman. After a short break, he met with Li Zongren and Fu Zuoyi. They held a meeting that night to study how the troops inside the Guan could cooperate with the operations outside the Guan, according to the instructions of Chairman Jiang.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 29th] The Pan Zhou Guan area has become more peaceful, the battle situation in West Shenyang has stabilized, and the morale of the people has greatly improved. A military observer said that the battle situation in the Northeast is like a ball game, with Pan and Harbin as the two goals of the football field and Siping as the midline. In the current situation, it is not a one-sided game. The national army guarding the goal is strong and stable, and the communist bandits' forwards lack the ability to break through the goal and only have brute force, so they will inevitably suffer losses. The national army forwards are in Jilin and Changchun, so we should not worry about this ball game.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After Xin Kaiyuan and Yingkou, it fell into the hands of the bandits on the morning of the 28th.

There are only about one division of bandits remaining in the Xinmin area, most of whom are in the northern bunkers. Another action being planned by the bandits may become clear in the coming days. Fuxin, Tieling, or Siping may be the targets of their attempted attack.</p>

<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Postpones Review of Aid to China Bill; Secret Meeting Scheduled for March 10</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced today that the Foreign Relations Committee has postponed its secret meetings to hear opinions on aid to China, Greece, and Turkey bills until March 10. According to participants, those who support military aid to China believe that it would be best to include it in the European Recovery Program, as President Truman would not reject the European Recovery Program in order to stop military aid to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Senator Bridges, chairman of the Republican Senate Appropriations Committee, attacked the government's report on aircraft aid to China tonight, calling it a "reluctant and superficial" effort. Bridges said: "As far as I know, since the victory over Japan, the United States has only transported 633 aircraft to China, of which 158 cannot be used due to lack of equipment. Transport planes account for 197 of all aircraft. The government wants to overcome the difficulties at a time when the Chinese Communists are attacking fiercely, so this kind of assistance is completely unsuitable. Since August 1946, not a single fighter or bomber has been transported to China. The government has not supplied aircraft parts to China for two years. A car is useless without gasoline, and so is an aircraft. Unless it can be maintained, the government does not make a real effort to comply with its obligations to China. China needs guns and ammunition for the army, and so far, the government has obviously done nothing about this urgent need."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Academic Atmosphere and Student Unrest</h3>
<p>Currently, schools at all levels are closing for vacation, and everyone is naturally paying attention to education. On the 24th of last month, the Ministry of Education issued an order to rectify the academic atmosphere. What kind of effect this order will have is a question in everyone's mind. We have never been very confident in the effectiveness of government orders to rectify the academic atmosphere. However, this time, we believe that the rectification of the academic atmosphere has its value and deserves considerable attention.</p>
<p>Why have we always not valued orders to rectify the academic atmosphere? Because the original meaning of "academic atmosphere" is to represent the comprehensive expression of the prevailing academic thoughts of a certain era and the lifestyle and behavior of the scholars of that era. One era has the prevailing academic thoughts of that era, and the behavioral standards of the scholars of that era, so one era has the academic atmosphere of that era. Therefore, the academic atmosphere of the Wei and Jin dynasties differed from that of the late Han dynasty, and the academic atmosphere of the early Qing dynasty differed from that of the Song dynasty. Although the so-called academic atmosphere of a certain era cannot be clearly explained in a few words, everyone seems to have a tacit understanding and an understanding when it is mentioned. The reason lies in the fact that it is the expression of the academic thoughts and the lifestyle and behavior of the scholars of that era. As long as one knows a little about the academic thoughts and the life of the scholars of that era, one will naturally understand what the academic atmosphere of that era is like.</p>
<p>Because of this, the academic atmosphere is very difficult to rectify. Because the formation of academic thoughts and the expression of the lifestyle and behavior of scholars have their objective and subjective conditions, which cannot be changed by an official document. A good academic atmosphere can only be cultivated gradually, little by little, or through the academic leadership and spiritual inspiration of great thinkers and great scholars. According to this statement, the so-called rectification of the academic atmosphere is naturally not very useful. This is the reason why we have always been suspicious that the academic atmosphere can be rectified.</p>
<p>However, this time, we have a different view on the order to rectify the academic atmosphere. To be honest, because what it wants to rectify is student unrest, not the academic atmosphere. Student unrest and the academic atmosphere are originally two different things and cannot be confused. However, these two things are somewhat related. The ancients said: "I hate purple stealing the place of vermilion, and I hate the music of Zheng disrupting elegant music." The academic atmosphere is vermilion, and student unrest is purple. The academic atmosphere is elegant music, and student unrest is the music of Zheng. The academic atmosphere originally has two ends, one end is excellent, and the other end is corrupt. A corrupt academic atmosphere is like a person's body weakening. But a weak body is not necessarily sick. As for the occurrence of student unrest, it is like being sick. To turn a weak body into a healthy one, one needs proper nutrition, attention to hygiene, exercise, to boost spirits, and psychological comfort. This belongs to the scope of cultivating the academic atmosphere. As for a weak body becoming ill, one must get injections and take medicine. The current rectification of the academic atmosphere should first take injections and medicine, and secondly, find ways to provide nutrition.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the first step first. There has been too much student unrest in the past year! We have made a small statistic based on newspapers. In the past year, a total of 142 incidents of student unrest occurred in colleges and universities across the country, involving 82 schools. Secondary schools are not included. The school with the most incidents of student unrest experienced ten incidents in one year. The school that wasted the most time only had six weeks of classes in half a year! In the past year, students have taken strikes and petitions as commonplace. Using democracy and freedom as a banner, they insulted teachers and attacked the government. Using the constitution as a cover, they beat each other and clashed with the police. Not only was this the case in the past year, but this trend is still brewing and continuing, and there is a real need to rectify it.</p>
<p>Why is there so much student unrest? We must clearly point out that this is created by the Communist Party and its peripheral elements. This incident is extremely obvious. For example, although some student unrests initially started from individual issues, or even for patriotic events, they often changed their nature later on. The student unrest in May last year was originally just a matter of school site issues and funding issues in a few schools, but later it turned into a nationwide "anti-hunger" and "anti-civil war", and the Communist Party's rampant "eat-all movement." That student unrest almost reached an uncontrollable point. This is a clear manifestation of the Communist Party using student unrest as a second battlefield.</p>
<p>The Communist Party and its foreign countries launch student unrests in an organized, planned, and highly mobile manner. When an incident occurs in one school, other schools immediately echo it. When action is taken in area A, area B immediately responds. On May 13th last year, students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University went to the North Railway Station, and on the same day, Nanjing Central University went on strike. From May 20th to May 26th, one school petitioned the Ministry of Education every day in one week, implementing its one-strike-a-day policy. Another example is the Tongji University student unrest in January this year. As soon as this side was preparing to go to Beijing, the other side had already contacted and prepared accommodation in Nanjing. A student union incident in one school even mobilized people from several schools to send them off, and some even came all the way from Beiping to send them off. It was originally a student incident, but factory workers also went to participate. Such organized and planned actions do not need to wait for the discovery of Communist Party documents to see that it is the work of the Communist Party and its peripheral elements.</p>
<p>In the summer of the year before last, when the "Democratic League" had not yet been disbanded, they carried out various strategies in Shanghai. At that time, they published a "Shanghai Cultural Circle National Crisis Education Plan." It had the following statement: "Only the practical actions of national liberation are education for national salvation!" The so-called national liberation is naturally international communism; using international communism as an educational goal, what is the intention? Isn't this clearly trying to turn the entire education into a tool for communist struggle? The original plan also said: "All educators, in cooperation with all democratic fighters, using all democratic forces, to strive for the realization of democratic politics is the true democratic education." This is even more blatantly trying to collude with the communists, overthrow the government, and even claim that this is democratic education. This is a real slander against democratic education! The Communist Party and its peripheral elements using schools as a second battlefield have given us extremely clear evidence in this document. Therefore, since then, student unrest has been going on one after another. Today, the government is rectifying the academic atmosphere, and the first step should be to persuade the principals of each school to eliminate the lurking communists and their followers in the schools.</p>
<p>Secondly, education itself has also suffered from weakness, and has a congenital deficiency and acquired maladjustment. In terms of school buildings and equipment, although it has been two years since the restoration, it has not yet reached a sufficient level. The regular expenses of the school, even the largest university, are only over 100 million yuan per month, and ordinary ones are only 50 to 60 million yuan. Paying for water and electricity alone is not enough, and it is impossible to talk about purchasing other equipment! In the national budget, an amount of foreign exchange was allocated for the purchase of equipment for national colleges and universities across the country, but the amount was very small. It was 500,000 US dollars the year before last, and it was still 500,000 US dollars last year and this year. On average, each school only receives a few thousand yuan per year, and after buying magazines and newspapers, there is nothing left. It is even more difficult to talk about scientific equipment. As for the treatment of teachers, their monthly income is "not enough to support their parents, and not enough to raise their wives and children." They are in extreme difficulty, crying for hunger and cold. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to even maintain life, let alone engage in academic research? Even if there are those who are studious, willing to endure hunger and cold, and do not complain, and want to engage in academic research, it is impossible to do so due to equipment difficulties. In this way, the content of academics cannot be enriched at all, and how can a good academic atmosphere be cultivated?</p>
<p>Therefore, there are two aspects to rectifying the academic atmosphere? First, to reduce student unrest, and second, to increase education funding, enrich school buildings and equipment, and cultivate educational vitality. Regarding the second point, the government should of course take more responsibility. Regarding the first point, it is not only the responsibility of the government, but also the principals and teachers of schools, and young people who truly love their studies, should all be vigilant and responsible. As long as the Communist Party and its peripheral elements are not eliminated, the education field cannot be stabilized. The country and individuals will suffer together!</p>

<h3>Chairperson Chiang's Speech at the Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>Encouraging to Love Other People's Children as Our Own</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Madam Chiang said in her speech at the inaugural meeting of the China Committee for the United Nations Fundraising for Children's Relief Fund on the 29th:</p>
<p>Today is the day when the United Nations universally launches fundraising for the world's refugee children relief fund. It gives every country an opportunity to give play to the spirit of universal love. As a member of the United Nations, China should do its best to participate in this righteous cause.</p>
<p>There are about 300 million impoverished and suffering children in the world, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total world population, of which about 64 million are in our country. The United Nations has taken on this difficult task to speak for these 300 million children, raise funds, and solve their problems of food, clothing, and shelter. Its ambition is truly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>This campaign is appealing to the responsibility of mankind. If we are indifferent to the hunger and cold of suffering children, then we are giving up our responsibility to build a beautiful world for the next generation. This movement is calling on our compatriots across the country to recognize the responsibilities we shoulder and fulfill our obligations.</p>
<p>This fundraising campaign will adopt a voluntary donation method, and the proceeds will be distributed to poor children all over the world, regardless of race, religion, nationality, or political belief, equally and without discrimination. Every penny donated will be given entirely to refugee children, and if there are expenses required for fundraising, other ways will be found.</p>
<p>During our country's eight-year war of resistance in the past, we received many gifts from foreign friends, and wartime refugee children benefited a lot. Some countries themselves were also in poverty and hardship, but they were still generous in helping us. This spirit is especially worthy of our gratitude. Recently, the United Nations has designated 3.5 million US dollars to help Chinese children. I think you must have the same feeling as me that we cannot only accept and not want to give.</p>
<p>We must know that giving is more blessed than receiving. Abundant sowing will surely lead to abundant harvests. Our China is indeed also in poverty, but this move is to promote the spirit of universal love. Therefore, our sharing of clothes and food is naturally more meaningful than enjoying it alone. Our ancient proverb says, "Love other people's children as our own." Let us fully express this traditional virtue of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The members of the China Committee of the United Nations World Refugee Children's Relief are known for their enthusiasm for public good and are very enthusiastic about the public welfare of the world. Many members are here today for the meeting. During our difficult and arduous war of resistance, you all used your time, energy, or material contributions to reduce the suffering of wartime children and refugees. I hope that everyone can use the same wholehearted efforts to promote the work of this relief for refugee children around the world and be an advocate for our people across the country. The most glorious achievement in life is to have the power to help others. Today is our opportunity to make the most practical contribution to mankind in the world. We should not expect others' gratitude or reward in the slightest, but respond generously to this fundraising campaign.</p>

During the three months of transferring to Lingling, Hunan, it trained three major detachments of honorary officers, all of whom were unknown heroes in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since the corps moved to Chongqing, it has established party and government training classes.

<h3>Aid to Europe Plan Transferred to the US Senate, International Situation is Critical and Urgent, Vandenberg Urges Early Passage and Implementation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said today that after the Czech event, the European Recovery Program has become increasingly urgent, and the time factor has become the main element of the US's future actions. The European Recovery Program will be discussed in the Senate starting Monday, and it is hoped that this program can be resolved before discussing other aid bills and submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion on March 15. The other bills referred to by Vandenberg are the new plans for aid to China and aid to Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently issued a report on aid to Europe, showing that the committee confirmed that European countries will not be able to maintain their freedom and independence without assistance. The report will be attached to the committee's draft aid to Europe bill and sent to the Senate together on Monday. The report states: "What must be decided today is whether we will continue to work to achieve the goal of building a stable world, establishing a free political system and the rule of law. The stability of the world is inextricably linked to the stability of Europe. Free institutions and true independence must not be allowed to perish in Europe or be threatened elsewhere in the world. Therefore, we should base our decision on the resolution that has been made, that is, whether Europe can maintain its freedom and independence without economic recovery, and decide the path we should follow. This committee is well aware that Europe cannot maintain its freedom and independence without economic recovery, and therefore has given the most sincere review to the European Recovery Program." The report then continued to discuss the Soviet Union's attitude towards the European Recovery Program, stating, "The Soviet Union and the communist parties of other European countries, their position can greatly help the European Recovery Program, or it can harm the success of the program. Recent developments show that the path to be taken by the communist party is mostly the latter. The communist party has repeatedly slandered the US's motives for the European Recovery Program through the Communist Information Bureau. In some countries participating in the program, communist-led labor strikes and riots have occurred, thereby hindering Europe's production efforts. The Soviet Union especially has a unique position to obstruct the recovery of trade between Eastern and Western Europe. The recent trade agreements that have been established or are under negotiation between Eastern and Western Europe are encouraging."</p>
<h3>Advocating Keeping the Door Open to Eastern European Countries</h3>
<p>The report states that the economic health of Europe and the development of closer political and economic relations between European countries are important factors for both peace and prosperity. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the European Recovery Program is not only economic cooperation in the form of customs unions, but also closer political and cultural ties. Regarding the issue of participating countries, the report advocates keeping the door open to Finland, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, so that they can participate. As for whether Spain can ultimately participate, it should depend on whether the country is willing to accept the obligations under the plan, whether other participating countries are willing to accommodate Spain, and whether Spain can conclude a satisfactory agreement with the industry country. The report finally stated that this kind of assistance in peacetime is unprecedented in human history. European countries know that the United States has made this major decision, and its responsibilities are no less than those of European countries. Its purpose is to seek common welfare and peace, and people around the world must have a common understanding of this.</p>
<h3>Western European Alliance Plan, Preliminary Technical Discussions by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Meeting of Prime Ministers of Five Countries in the Works</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 29th] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak said in an exclusive interview with our reporter that the meeting of the Prime Ministers of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to discuss the Western European Alliance Plan is in the works. He put forward the suggestion to convene this meeting last week, and a resolution can be made soon. However, before the talks between the Prime Ministers of the five countries, a solid foundation for negotiations must be prepared.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is possible that experts will first hold preliminary technical discussions on issues related to the establishment of the Western European Alliance in one of the five capitals. These discussions may be held in parallel with the Three Powers' meeting on the German issue currently being held in London. When the reporter mentioned the rumor in New York that the United States is planning to conclude a treaty of alliance with Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, Spaak said that he had not heard of such a plan. He then said that if it is true, it is an extremely important matter and should be given the most careful consideration. Spaak also expressed his hope that the recent events in Eastern Europe will not change the trend that the Marshall Plan is expected to pass smoothly in the United States recently. The Marshall Plan is becoming more and more necessary and should be passed and implemented quickly.</p>

One faction is the federalist faction led by MacKay, which advocates the establishment of a political merger between Western European countries under a European constitutional assembly. The other faction is the pragmatist faction led by Labour Party left-wing leader Crossman, which advocates the establishment of a Western European alliance with only state-level economic concepts. Crossman's faction advocates the establishment of a permanent European executive agency, with representatives from West Germany also able to participate as observers, and plans to establish a common commodity bureau to implement the unified procurement of food and raw materials. In addition, a common planning bureau will be established to formulate an emergency plan within twelve months, paying special attention to agriculture.</p>

<h3>Finland Prepares to Accept Soviet Proposal, Stalin's Letter Published, Finnish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Recalled Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 28th] According to our sources, most of the political parties in Finland are prepared to accept Marshal Stalin's proposal to conclude a treaty of military assistance and friendship with the Soviet Union equal to the Soviet-Hungarian and Soviet treaties. According to a broadcast from Moscow Radio of Marshal Stalin's letter to Finnish President Paasikivi, the full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"In order to actively improve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland and to consolidate peace and security, the Soviet government proposes that the Soviet Union and Finland conclude a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance equal to the Soviet-Hungarian and Soviet treaties. If Finland does not object, it is hoped that a delegation will be sent to the Soviet Union to conclude this treaty. If the Finnish government believes that negotiations should be held in Finland, the Soviet government is also prepared to send a delegation to Helsinki. Sincerely, Stalin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers." In addition to attaching the previous letter, the Soviet government's note to the Finnish government pointed out that Finland is the only country bordering the Soviet Union that was a former enemy and has not yet concluded such a treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviet note did not stipulate a deadline for Finland's response, so the Finnish Parliament will discuss the matter in accordance with constitutional procedures.</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Helsinki, 29th] The Finnish ambassador to the Soviet Union is expected to arrive here on the 29th. However, well-informed sources expressed doubt about the ambassador carrying a new note from the Soviet government. These people believe that the ambassador was recalled to report to the government on the Soviet Union's attitude towards the proposed Soviet-Finnish alliance treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Helsinki, 28th] Soviet Ambassador Savonenkov entered the presidential residence today for a seven-minute meeting in order to hear the Finnish government's views on Stalin's proposal. Finnish politicians admitted that the Soviet Union has a powerful weapon, which is grain. Without grain from the Soviet Union, Finland will face famine. Political leaders and the public are opposed to forming an alliance with any country, but the Communist Party supports the proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Helsinki, 28th] The Finnish president may send a delegation to Moscow before Tuesday to participate in negotiations. Although Moscow Radio broadcast tonight that the Soviet-Finnish treaty is aimed at preventing future aggression by the general country, both countries suffered heavy damage from German aggression. If the same thing happens again, both governments should be responsible to their people. However, what most people are most concerned about is whether Stalin's request is purely to protect Soviet territory, especially Leningrad, or whether he has other intentions.</p>

<h3>The Korean Commission Will Leave the US Tomorrow to Fly to Seoul to Resume Work; South Korea Will Start General Elections, Earliest in Early May</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 28th] Persons close to the United Nations Korean Commission predicted on the 28th: The earliest date for Korea to start elections will be May 2nd. The commissioners here will fly to Seoul on March 2nd and arrive on March 6th, so that the commissioners who have arrived there can resume work on March 8th.</p>
<p>Their progress will be closely watched by Lake Success, as some diplomats there are deeply concerned that the current chaos in southern Korea may postpone the May 2nd election. One of the commission's first tasks on March 8th will be to study the conditions for supervising and observing the election, and to decide whether the general election will include certain areas. In this regard, the extent to which the commission will accept US assistance is also under consideration. Some people here believe that too much US assistance will provoke criticism that US pressure is affecting the election results.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 28th] Military Governor Lieutenant General Lerch reiterated the order to the provincial police chiefs, urging them to maintain law and order and to be responsible to their respective provincial governors. This move is apparently to prevent the police from interfering in the upcoming general election.</p>

The interests of handicraftsmen and small traders would be guaranteed in the constitution. According to the announcement of the Czech Central Action Committee, the national life of Czechoslovakia will be concentrated within the reorganized National Front. The resolutions of the National Front are binding on all parties. Political parties cannot engage in political activities without the approval of the Action Committee.</p>
<h3>Political Developments in Marato, West Java; The Conciliation Committee Will Pay Attention; The Security Council Passes the Proposal of Our Representative</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] The United Nations Security Council resolved on the 29th to extend the life of the Indonesian-Dutch Mediation Committee. The Soviet Union abstained from the vote. Indonesia accused the Netherlands of instigating the establishment of a puppet state on the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. The Security Council demanded an immediate investigation into the matter. The Security Council requested the Mediation Committee to continue to perform its duties and to negotiate a permanent political solution based on the recent ceasefire agreement successfully negotiated. Colombia proposed to put more effort into the committee, but it was rejected.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 28th] As the Security Council debated the Indonesian issue today, it passed a resolution proposed by China, ordering the United Nations Mediation Committee to pay special attention to the political developments in West Java and Madura Island. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Argentina all abstained. The Security Council also passed a resolution proposed by Canada, asking Indonesia and the Netherlands to make more use of the services of the United Nations Mediation Committee. This resolution did not give the Mediation Committee more power than before, unlike the resolution proposed by China, which expanded the Mediation Committee's powers to West Java and Madura. The debate on the Indonesian issue has now come to a temporary end.</p>

<h3>The Memoirs of Hull (3)(6)</h3>
<p>— Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance, compiled by this newspaper's translation department</p>
<p>It is always good to cooperate with people</p>
<p>In the late autumn of 1944, my colleagues and I began to suspect that Stalin and his government had begun to deviate from the policy of cooperation they had agreed to at the Moscow Conference, a policy they had followed until now with few exceptions.</p>
<p>We began to learn of signs that the Soviet Union would demand a high price in the peace treaties with Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, allowing them to almost take control of these countries. At the same time, we were also forced to pay close attention to the Soviet Union's tough stance on the voting issue in the Security Council.</p>
<p>So, on September 18, I sent a telegram to Ambassador Harriman in Moscow, mentioning the voting issue that had occurred at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. I said that this matter, coupled with some other recent developments reported by Harriman, had raised great doubts in our minds about the Soviet Union's long-term policy in the future. I also said that I had begun to suspect that Stalin and the Kremlin giants had decided to change the policy they had established at the Moscow and Tehran Conferences and take a completely opposite path. Therefore, I wanted Harriman to make an assessment of the current trend of Soviet policy so that we could decide how to deal with this possible change in Soviet attitude.</p>
<p>I told Harriman that it would be even more helpful if he could tell me his views on why this shift in Soviet policy toward the United States had occurred, and why the Soviet attitude toward Britain had become tougher.</p>
<p>The next day, Harriman replied by telegram, citing several instances of unilateral Soviet action or apparent unwillingness to cooperate with the United States and Britain. He said: We have sufficient evidence to anticipate that if we establish such an international organization that stipulates that in the event of any international dispute, discussion must be approved by all permanent members, regardless of whether it is a party to the dispute itself, the Soviet government will ruthlessly resist the Security Council from discussing any issue that it believes will affect its own interests. The Soviet government will insist that such matters should be resolved directly by the Soviet Union and other parties concerned, especially any disputes between it and its neighbors.</p>
<p>Harriman expressed his confidence that Stalin and his key advisors placed the overall cooperation between the Soviet Union and the other three powers in the most important position, but they hoped that their political and military strength could enable them to control the situation. He said that there was no doubt that the Soviet people longed for peace and believed that the close relationship developed with Britain and the United States during the war would continue after the war and ensure a long-term and lasting peace.</p>
<p>The ambassador did not believe that Stalin could abandon the material and psychological value of this cooperation without causing serious anxiety among the Soviet people. However, there were still some powerful figures close to Stalin who were unwilling to give up their right to independent action in areas related to Soviet interests, and unwilling to see the Soviet Union rely entirely on a world organization that had not yet been tried and to cooperate with countries they did not fully trust. Harriman felt that Stalin liked to be prepared for anything, so naturally, he would use both methods at the same time to obtain his country's security and enhance what he believed to be his country's interests.</p>
<p>When I left the State Department, the Soviet policy I advocated was based on two foundations. The first is: continue to conduct regular and friendly consultations with the Soviet Union. Consult with them on any event. Explain to them the principles we believe are necessary to promote international peace relations, and if necessary, explain again and again as clearly as possible that the Soviet Union can gain more benefits by fully cooperating with other countries, while controlling neighboring countries has very few benefits. Make it clear to them that we are not opposed to a country promoting the merits of its own form of government, whether it is communism or democracy, but we are opposed to a country interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
<p>I hoped that if my health allowed me to continue in office, I could persuade the Soviet Union to adopt a policy of cooperation and non-interference that is commonly practiced in the Western Hemisphere, and make this a firm world policy that all countries can abide by. Under this Pan-American policy transplanted to Europe, the Soviet Union could maintain the most friendly political relations and the most vigorous economic exchange with its neighbors without interfering in their internal affairs.</p>
<p>The second part of our Soviet policy was: to give the Soviet Union a practical example through our own actions, telling them how we felt they should behave. So I opposed the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to have the United States retain the Pacific islands seized from the Japanese. I strongly felt that all colonies seized from the Axis countries should be placed under the United Nations governing system, without exception. It was easy to see that the Soviet Union would be dissatisfied with our immediate possession of these islands; but it was also easy to see that the Soviet Union would use this as a precedent for similar possessions in the future. If we took possession of these islands, we would no longer be able to oppose similar actions by other countries in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also opposed the planned Chapultepec Act passed at the Mexico City Conference in March 1945, after I resigned from the war, in which the American republics actually agreed to military intervention in any one of them under certain circumstances. Once we agreed to this new interventionist status, the Soviet Union would have even more reason to interfere in its neighbors, and we would have no reason to oppose it.</p>
<p>Similarly, I was also unwilling to endorse the plan advocated by Charles, together with the army and navy authorities, to standardize the military equipment of the Western Hemisphere, which meant that the United States would equip the Latin American republics well during peacetime. I felt that it would be a difficult and unfair thing to arm them and require them to fight when necessary, because we knew they could not fight, and their help to us, as shown in the Second World War, was more important in terms of economic and base use than in terms of battlefield help.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also opposed changing our wartime policy of uncompromising opposition to the nationalist regime of Argentina, which had allied itself with the Nazis. The compromise attitude at the Mexico City and San Francisco conferences, which allowed Argentina to join the United Nations, weakened the mutual trust that could have existed between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and I had very similar views on the Soviet issue. We both felt that the road of relations between the two countries was not a smooth one, but we also felt that we could live together with the Soviet Union. As far as I can remember, the President and I had no disagreement on this basic assumption, that we must and can live together amicably with the Soviet government.</p>
<p>The President and Stalin, Churchill discussed the issues at the Yalta Conference, he did not discuss it with me beforehand, and I did not know anything about the secret concessions given to the Soviet Union at the meeting. I did not know about them until the secret agreement was made public later. Yalta was the only international conference attended by President Roosevelt after I left office. My opinions on various issues between the great powers are recorded in detail in the minutes of the State Department's regular meetings and conversations. When I left office, I still opposed giving the Soviet Union more voting rights than our own. My view was that each major power, with such strong desires and influence, could obtain a full expression of its rights and interests at any time without any problems, and did not need to retain more than one vote.</p>
<p>After I resigned, when the President came to visit me in the hospital, including his last visit a few days before his death, he never mentioned to me any fear that the Soviet Union would abandon our movement for peaceful cooperation or would obstruct or undermine it. Because he and I had been working together since 1933 to achieve a better understanding with the Soviet Union, and of course, our common plan for a peace organization went without saying, so I firmly believe that if he had indeed felt that the Soviet Union was taking a dangerous path, he would have mentioned it to me.</p>
<p>One might say that the President and I were deceived by the Soviet promises and guarantees, that we should have known that it was impossible to deal with the Soviet Union, that we should have seen long ago that a democratic United States could not be friends with a communist government, so we should have adopted a policy of containment toward the Soviet Union from the beginning.</p>
<p>But when we look back at our relationship with Moscow, I feel, as President Roosevelt also felt, that we had every reason to adopt this friendly policy. Since 1917, the Soviet Union had struggled with many countries that refused to recognize it, and these countries refused to recognize it, in part because of the Soviet Union's policy of directing and inciting rebellion from Moscow. Through long-term efforts, it gradually gained recognition from more countries, and almost every time negotiations were conducted to recognize the Soviet Union, it had to agree not to engage in subversive activities against countries that established relations with it.</p>
<p>It is true that it did not completely abandon this activity. But we felt that other countries, as long as they firmly organized, built up, and strengthened world opinion against this activity, could prompt the Soviet Union to abandon this strategy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The fact shows that the President and I took strong measures against the Soviet government several times during the period from recognizing the Soviet Union in 1933 to the Moscow Conference in 1943. I never missed an opportunity to point out to the Soviet Union the benefits to itself of abandoning that thorny policy of interference.</p>
<p>The President and I believed that it was in the best interests of the Soviet Union itself to fully become a member of the United Nations security mechanism and to cooperate with it wholeheartedly, and that the Soviet leaders would recognize this fact. We believed at the time, and I still believe now, that the United Nations organization would eventually become a unified and powerful body with sufficient power to maintain peace. We also knew that there would be difficulties, some of which would come from the Soviet Union. The United Nations organization would have to go through a period of wavering and fragility; but by the end of 1944, we were certain that we and the countries that were working with us had laid the foundation for this planned mechanism, in which the Soviet Union and we could cooperate together.</p>
<p>On several occasions in our relations with the Soviet Union, the President and I often received the definite opinion of our senior military generals, saying that from their military point of view, friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union after the war was also very necessary.</p>

<h3>Six Thousand New Recruits Drawn by Lottery; Family Allowance of Ten Stones of Rice per Person; Volunteers Allowed to Enlist to Offset the Catching Quota; Processing to Begin Immediately and Completed by the End of June</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] This year's conscription conference in this city was held at the City Council yesterday morning at 9:00 am. After detailed discussions at the meeting, it was decided that the method of conscription for this year would be based on lottery, but if there were people who were eager to enlist and voluntarily applied for enlistment and were indeed registered in this city, they would still be allowed to enlist to offset the quota. The date of the conscription was decided to begin immediately and be completed by the end of June. The eight key resolutions of yesterday's meeting are as follows: (1) Whether this city's conscription for the 37th year of the Republic should adopt the voluntary soldier method or implement regular conscription according to law. The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are listed and a proposal is made for public resolution. Resolution: Conscription by lottery will be the principle, but if there are people who are eager to enlist and voluntarily apply for enlistment and are indeed registered in this city, they will still be allowed to enlist to offset the quota. (2) When should the conscription date for this city this year be determined? Resolution: Process immediately until the end of June. (3) Please confirm the family allowance for new recruits in the 37th year of the Republic. Resolution: 1. Each new recruit will be given ten stones of medium-cooked rice. 2. It will be paid in three installments. The first installment will be 50% upon the new recruit's entry into the camp, 25% will be paid three months later, and 25% will be paid three months later. 3. It will be coordinated and allocated by the Conscription Association. (4) The responsibility for the physical examination of new recruits should end when the new recruits have been assigned to the troops. Resolution: The decision will be made after consultation between the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Regiment Headquarters, and the Conscription Association. (5) Unify the condolence matters for new recruits. Resolution: The Civil Affairs Bureau and the Conscription Association will negotiate a unified method and issue a circular to all districts for implementation. (6) Strictly manage young men of conscription age to prevent evasion of military service. Resolution: To be handled by the Civil Affairs Bureau. (7) There have been many changes in the roster of young men in the 36th year of the Republic, and it is proposed to recompile it to maintain accuracy. Resolution: To be handled by the Civil Affairs Bureau. (8) The conscription expenses handled by the district offices should be regulated. Resolution: Passed in principle and handed over to the Conscription Association for planning and processing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Mayor Wu. The attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Conscription Association; Standing Committee members Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiyin; Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison; Chen Tianqiao, Commander of the Regiment; Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau; as well as district chiefs, chairmen of district people's representative conferences, and representatives of various agencies, totaling more than 100 people. Wei Rulin, Director of the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Li Wenshan, Deputy Commander of the Jiangzhe Garrison, attended the meeting for guidance. Chairman Mayor Wu delivered the opening remarks, briefly saying: Last year, the city's conscription was completed on schedule and in full thanks to the assistance of the City Council and the Conscription Association. Although there were some shortcomings, conscription in Shanghai was the first time, which was not easy. This year's conscription was ordered by the Central Government, and the quota has been doubled. Reviewing the shortcomings of the past, how to make this year's performance perfect depends on everyone's full expression of opinions.</p>

<h3>Deputy Director Wei Instructs Four Points: The Central Government Urgently Needs Troops; No Postponement or Reduction of Quota is Allowed</h3>
<p>Wei Rulin, Deputy Director of the Conscription Bureau, who attended the meeting for guidance, then gave a speech, conveying four instructions on conscription in this city, briefly saying: (1) During the period of suppressing the rebellion, the Central Government urgently needs troops, so during the national conscription, one cannot postpone the date and two cannot reduce the quota. Shanghai's troop quota is 6,000, which must be completed before the end of June. Now Shanghai has a population of more than 5 million, accounting for only a little more than one-thousandth of the country's population. Other provinces and regions in the country are coordinating the rebellion in politics, economy, and culture. Their conscription system focuses on the militia, so replenishment is rapid and noteworthy for our conscription reference. (3) Shanghai's volunteer soldiers last year achieved satisfactory results. If a lottery can be used this year, it would be best. If it is unavoidable to use volunteer soldiers, it is also acceptable, but the family allowance for new recruits cannot be given in one lump sum. It is necessary to regularly subsidize their families, and the guarantor must be reliable, and the validity period must be two years, until the time of discharge. (4) Some people believe that China already has 4 or 5 million soldiers, so why must Shanghai conscript 6,000 people? However, from a national perspective, Shanghai cannot not conscript. Shanghai is an international metropolis, and not conscripting would be unfair. Deputy Director Wei especially pointed out that this city's conscription quota for this term is 6,000, and another quota will be determined later according to military needs. Next, Deputy Commander Li, Speaker Pan, Commander Fu, and Director Zhang successively delivered speeches.</p>
<h3>Pan, Chairman of the Board, suggests local training for new recruits to protect their hometown</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Municipal Council and Chairman of the Military Service Association, rushed back from the capital yesterday morning to attend the Military Service Conference. In his address yesterday, Mr. Pan suggested that the 6,000 new recruits conscripted by this municipality should be trained locally to protect the area. He also appealed to those with money to donate generously so that the strong young men can enlist without worry, and to those with strength to contribute their efforts.</p>
<p>The main points of Chairman Pan's speech are as follows: (1) From the instructions of Deputy Director Wei of the Military Service Bureau, we have gained a new insight regarding conscription. That is, how the Communists mobilize the people's power to destroy production and betray the country. Therefore, we must all recognize, especially the citizens of Shanghai, that there is no survival for us if the Communists exist. Why is it that the Communists have no shortage of soldiers, while we find conscription difficult? The reason lies entirely in the method. We should understand ourselves and our enemy, abandon our weaknesses and adopt their strengths, starting with the psychology of the people and the needs of the locality, and then seek to thoroughly understand the nation's military service policy. (2) How should this city implement this year's conscription? I believe that the 6,000 strong young men conscripted according to the Conscription Law should be trained locally in this city and formed into a local defense force, fully developing the concept of everyone protecting their hometown, and ensuring the safety of this city. This city is the largest industrial and commercial city in the country, and half of the national tax revenue depends on this city. Therefore, protecting the safety of this city is tantamount to protecting the safety of the country. Moreover, new recruits must have sufficient training before they can develop the habit of military life and the skills to fight in defense of the area. In the future, they can be promoted step by step. When the training reaches a certain period, there will be patriotic young men who volunteer and eagerly compete to defend the country, and the citizens of this city will surely reward them with high respect, treat them preferentially, and ensure the security of their families, so that they will be brave in killing the enemy and have no worries about the future.</p>
<p>Gun not leaving man, man not leaving hometown</p>
<p>(3) Moreover, General Marshall, during his time in the military and after returning to the United States, criticized our country's military administration, focusing on the improvement of the personnel replenishment system. General Marshall strongly opposed sending rural young men who had not received any training to the front lines. I personally strongly agree with this. Therefore, the Military Service Association proposed at this meeting that the first batch of 6,000 conscripts in this city this year should be trained locally in this city, with the first mission being to protect the area. If so, then this conscription in this city will be a matter of guns not leaving men, men not leaving their hometowns, first cultivating the habit of everyone being willing to serve in the military, and all eligible young men will surely rush to join. Moreover, this progressive and improved conscription method is already advocated by many senior generals at the front. This city is a place of great concern both at home and abroad, and should take the lead in advocating it, as a starting point for gradually improving the military service system.</p>
<p>Contribute strength if you have it, contribute money if you have it</p>
<p>(4) Serving in the military is a national duty, and it should be promoted fairly according to the principle of "contribute strength if you have it, contribute money if you have it." Last year, this city conscripted 3,000 men, adopting the volunteer system. Although the cooperation between the government and civil organizations was not entirely ideal, it was fortunate that the quota was met, which is gratifying. However, the volunteer system also has its shortcomings, and the fundraising for settlement fees and consolation fees requires considerable effort. There are many who are enthusiastic and public-spirited, but there are also many who are rich but unkind and unwilling to contribute a penny. Of the 17 billion spent so far, there are still 4.5 billion in bank loans outstanding, and approximately 3 billion in guarantee money paid by those exempted or postponed from conscription (which must be returned if not approved) must be refunded. Therefore, the Military Service Association's debt of over 7 billion still needs to be jointly raised and made up. Now that military service must be handled again this year, we must solemnly appeal to those with wealth and resources, for the sake of the area and the strong young men, to generously donate and assist in its success. It must be understood that protecting the area and the country is also protecting the lives and property of the general public. With great difficulties ahead, we must work together to overcome them, and no one is allowed to hide away in peace.</p>
<h3>Age of New Recruits</h3>
<p>After the meeting, it was rumored that the commander stated that the principle of lottery conscription has been decided. The ages drawn will be from 21 to 23. The method will be indirect lottery, with the Military Service Association setting up a lottery committee to handle the matter, to show solemnity. The proposal by Speaker Pan Gongzhan for new recruits to be trained locally and organized into local self-defense teams was hotly debated and will be submitted to Chairman Chiang for a decision.</p>
<h3>Full Force to Curb Soaring Yarn Prices, Spot Checks on Warehouse Yarn Stock, First Batch of Top Ten Yarn Brands Suspected, Suspension of Auditing Records</h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival in this city, the price surge has been fierce, and the fluctuation of cotton yarn has been leading the way. The Cotton Yarn Management Committee attaches great importance to this and intends to curb the soaring yarn prices with all its strength. The Audit Department of the committee, together with the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, have consulted and agreed on temporary emergency measures. Starting today, spot checks will be carried out on the yarn stock in warehouses throughout the city. With confidential reports provided by relevant agencies, the first batch of ten major yarn brands are suspected of manipulating and hoarding, and auditing of the transaction records and locations of yarn warehouses for each brand has begun. At the same time, the Economic Police Team of the Police Bureau has been ordered to step up surveillance of trading activities in the markets of various industries starting today, paying special attention to the cotton yarn market. In the future, any off-market trading behavior discovered will be arrested and dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Businesses Becoming More Difficult After Sudden Increase in Last Month's Index</h3>
<p>Xinyi Factory Proposes Dismissal and Wage Reduction Measures</p>
<p>Since the living index for last month was released the day before yesterday, the industrial and commercial sectors have responded strongly to the index increasing by more than 50% compared to the previous month. According to official predictions, disputes over wage reductions and dismissals in the production industry are likely to increase in the future. It is hoped that labor and management will truly understand and cooperate with each other to avert the current crisis. It is especially hoped that workers can work hard to increase production to compensate for the factory's huge wage expenditure. As for the situation of wage reductions and dismissals, it has already begun to brew in various industries with poor business. For example, Xinyi Hwa Factory, the management has notified the factory's industrial union of two draft austerity measures, asking the workers to choose one of the following: (1) Legally dismiss 120 female workers and pay them dismissal fees. (2) Adopt a rotational work system, with each person working half a month per month. The former is a dismissal, and the latter is a wage reduction, both of which affect the lives of the workers. The factory union has sent a letter to the factory asking it to withdraw its decision.</p>
<h3>Complex Ownership of Unclaimed Aircraft, In Addition to Dahua Airlines, Two Other Parties Came Forward to Claim</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration previously published a notice in the newspaper seeking claimants for four unclaimed aircraft parked at Longhua Airport. In addition to Cao Shiang, the former head of the aviation group of Dahua Airlines, who had made oral contact, recently other individuals have come forward to formally claim them. One is Kong Guangxiao, a representative of the Kong Consortium, and the other is lawyers Hu Yongsheng and Chen Qingfeng, representatives of the Xinsui Company. Both parties hold relevant documents, claiming that the four aircraft should belong to them. The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration has sent the letters and documents from both parties to the Nanjing Civil Aviation Administration for review and decision. It is reported that the four aircraft were originally owned by Dahua Company, but because Dahua Company's request for formal establishment was not approved by the government, the four aircraft were mortgaged in various ways to clear debts, and therefore the ownership relationship is very complicated.</p>
<h3>Four District Flour Associations Assist in Northward Transportation Matters</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to solve the problem of food for the people in North China, the Ministry of Food plans to transport 500,000 bags of flour to Pingjin every month. Among them, 150,000 bags are undertaken by the flour industry in Hankou, and 350,000 bags are assisted in transportation and sales by the Fourth District Flour Industry Association. The association has already formed a transit flour committee to specifically regulate the transit of flour. In order to solve the problem of capital turnover difficulties for its affiliated factories, it has negotiated with the China Trust Bureau to have the bureau purchase the flour and pay for it in Shanghai. The 350,000 bags of transit flour for February have mostly been transported out.</p>
<h3>Jianxin Vessel Run Aground, Still Not Out of Danger Yesterday, Part of the Ore Thrown into the Sea</h3>
<p>The Jianxin Vessel, represented by Yixiang Company, unfortunately ran aground at Zhelang Cape in Dapeng Bay, 80 nautical miles from Hong Kong, on the morning of the 28th. The rescue ship arrived at the scene on the afternoon of the same day. According to the continued release of information by the person in charge of the company: The Jianxin Vessel was still not out of danger as of the afternoon of the 29th. In addition to the tugs sent by Hong Kong Hualin Hanxing, which continue to rescue, the Guangzhou Customs has also sent a patrol vessel, which is docked near the vessel. Some of the personnel on board have moved to the customs patrol vessel. The vessel has no major losses, and part of the ore has been thrown into the sea under the witness of customs personnel to reduce the load and allow the vessel to float. It is expected that after the vessel is out of danger, if the inspection shows minor damage, it will still be able to continue sailing to Kobe.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Association for Using Domestic Goods Starts Expanded Promotion Today</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Association for Using Domestic Goods in this city has been established for nearly three months. It has been striving to study the entire plan for promoting the use of domestic goods, hoping to achieve practical results. In addition to urging citizens to actively use domestic goods as much as possible, the association also urges major domestic goods factories to work hard to research excellent products, increase production, reduce costs and prices to adapt to the purchasing power of citizens. The association has scheduled to hold a major promotion week starting today, sending various wonderful recreational programs on the news radio station for seven days, and has invited Wu, the honorary chairman of the association, the mayor, President Pan, and celebrities from all walks of life to give speeches on the important significance of using domestic goods.</p>

After the victory, he served as the Director of the Fourth Transportation Station, stationed in Jinan, handling the logistics of various troops in Shandong, and his hard work was outstanding. In the annual national transportation station assessment, Zhou ranked first and was commended by the central government.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Base, Fang Ying, Old and Requests to Retire</h3>
<p>Navy Units Hold a Farewell Tea Party</p>
<p>The Navy Headquarters recently announced the exchange of commanders of the Shanghai Base, Fang Ying, and the Qingdao Base, Dong Shuzeng, and the exchange of commanders of the Taiwan Base, Huang Xuyu, and the Guangzhou Base, Jin Yizhen. However, Fang Ying, the commander of the Shanghai Base, requested to resign and retire due to old age and weakness. The Navy Headquarters has approved Fang's transfer to a member of the headquarters, and Qingdao has dispatched Gao Ming, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, to take over as commander. As for Dong Shuzeng, he will come to Shanghai to take up his post after the handover in Qingdao. The heads of various naval units in Shanghai held a tea party at the Naval Friendship Association at 3 pm yesterday to bid farewell to Fang Ying.</p>
<h3>Innovative Approach to Eradicating Mulberry Locusts Adopting New Method of Hatching Parasitic Wasps, Personnel Sent to Various Places to Work</h3>
<p>With silkworm rearing beginning before the Qingming Festival, how to eradicate mulberry locusts and protect the thriving mulberry seedlings to increase silkworm feed is a very important issue. In the past, protecting mulberry seedlings was nothing more than extensively collecting mulberry locust egg masses in mulberry locust breeding areas, but often failed to eradicate them completely afterwards. This year's plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is different. The method is to first transport the dug-up mulberry locust egg masses in batches to the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, place them in a culture room, and hatch them into a parasitic wasp (this wasp is most fond of foraging for mulberry locusts), and then release the parasitic wasps in areas where the mulberry locusts have not been completely eradicated, to eliminate them completely. This method is not only a new initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for the silk industry, but also a pioneering effort in our country to eliminate mulberry locusts. It is learned that the above plan has been fully discussed and matured by representatives of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang governments and the China Silk Company. The estimated cost is 1 billion yuan, with the military bearing half and the rest shared by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang governments. Cai Banghua (an entomologist), the president of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, has been hired as the commander-in-chief, and Zhang Zifang, a special commissioner of China Silk, as the deputy commander-in-chief. This week, team members will be sent to Wujiang, Wu Yu and other areas where mulberry locusts are rampant, to work with local government townships and silkworm guidance personnel.</p>
<h3>Rice Tickets Begin Distribution, Allocation Price to be Determined Today, Technical Problems of Distribution Discussed Yesterday</h3>
<p>With the repeated efforts of the Municipal Food Allocation Committee and the Civil Affairs Bureau, food allocation in this city has been decided to start on schedule today. At 4 pm yesterday, Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Food Allocation Committee, and Zhang Xiaosong, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, convened a meeting of more than 60 people, including the heads of districts and chairmen of district people's representative assemblies, at the Municipal Council to discuss the technical problems of allocating grain according to the number of people. It was decided that rice tickets would be distributed first in the three districts of Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Yulin today. Regardless of the size of the household, all registered residents will be allocated one "dou" of rice per person, half of which is from American aid materials and half from the government. The allocated rice has already reached the above three districts yesterday. The rice tickets for Zhabei and Yangshupu districts were also collected by the heads of the two districts yesterday and will be distributed to all citizens in the district this morning. The other districts will also issue them separately in the next two days. As for the allocation price, it will be decided at the food conference hosted by Mayor Wu, President Pan, and Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Food Allocation Committee, at 5 pm today. Gilbert Quiligotti, head of the Sino-American Relief Team, will also attend the meeting. According to sources, the allocation price will be 95% of today's market price. If today's market price is 3 million yuan, then the allocation price will be 2.85 million yuan. The allocation price will not be changed again during this month, regardless of the rise or fall of rice prices. The distributed rice tickets are also stipulated to be valid within this month. After the food conference decides on the allocation price this afternoon, the three designated rice stores will simultaneously start selling the allocated rice.</p>

<h3>Soaring Prices Due to Economic Neurosis: Minister of Economic Affairs Answers Reporters, Denounces Peace Talks as Groundless Rumors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian recently came to Shanghai on official business and returned to Nanjing by train last night. Before his departure, reporters visited him and he expressed his opinions on the various questions raised by the reporters as follows: (1) Question: What did Mayor Wu discuss with you? Answer: Discussed the Shanghai United Electric Power Company issue. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Shanghai Municipality have no differences in principle on this issue. The remaining technical issues are still subject to further negotiation. As it is my duty, I will do my best to promote the early establishment of the company to solve the electricity problem for Shanghai factories. (2) Question: What are the reasons for the recent sharp rise in prices? Answer: There are many reasons, and I cannot go into details at the moment. However, in terms of the recent sharp rise in prices, one reason is: the influx of idle capital from the Northeast into Shanghai to snap up goods; and two: the fabrication of rumors by unscrupulous people to arouse "economic neurosis" among the general public in order to make profits. Now that most of the idle capital from the Northeast has found its way out, and the current situation has become clearer, no one believes the rumors, and the "economic neurosis" of the general public has therefore improved slightly, and prices can be temporarily stabilized.</p>
<p>Stabilize Currency Value, Dredge Material Resources</p>
<p>(3) Question: What effective measures do you have to stabilize prices? Answer: The fundamental and effective measures are: (1) to reform the currency system and stabilize the currency value; (2) to work hard on construction and promote production; (3) to restore transportation and dredge the flow of material resources; (4) to improve the import system and absorb foreign capital and materials; (5) to strive to quell the chaos and establish peace. The government is either preparing or already implementing these measures, and once they are fully implemented, prices can be completely stabilized. As for the current emergency measures, they are naturally nothing more than managing finance, materials, and prices based on the circumstances, and cracking down on hoarding and speculation, in order to cure "economic neurosis."</p>
<p>Deeply Hope for Long-Term US Aid to China</p>
<p>(4) Question: What are your views on American aid? Answer: Marshall wants to use American aid to stabilize the Chinese economy and give China a breathing space so that China can gradually become self-reliant. We should be grateful and make proper use of this American aid in economic construction, so that it can truly promote production and stabilize prices, in order to live up to the expectations of our American friends. However, the aid needed by China in terms of military affairs, finance, economy, and currency reform is definitely not something that 570 million US dollars can solve. In addition to the emergency aid of 570 million US dollars, there is also a need for large-scale long-term aid. The greater and earlier the American aid to China, the earlier the revival of China will be.</p>
<p>Democracy and Communism are Absolutely Incompatible</p>
<p>(5) Question: What are your observations on the future of the current situation? Answer: The reason why the current situation is so serious can be traced back to the Yalta Conference. The conference allowed the Soviet Union to inherit all the rights of the Tsarist era in the Northeast, which has created the current serious situation. If the Yalta Conference had not allowed the Soviet Union to inherit the Tsarist era's rights of aggression in the Northeast, then the Chinese government would have completely taken over the Northeast long ago, and the current Northeast situation would not have developed. But no matter how serious the Northeast situation is, the government has decided to stand firm to the end, and there is absolutely no possibility of peace talks. Why can't there be any more peace talks? Because democracy and communism are absolutely incompatible, because the Communist bandits benefit from chaos in China and are not conducive to peace in China. If democracy and communism could be compatible, Marshall's various plans for China and Europe would not have been repeatedly attacked by the Soviet Union and the Communist bandits. Since the United States and the Soviet Union cannot reconcile, neither can the Kuomintang and the Communists, so peace talks are absolutely impossible, and peace rumors are absolutely unbelievable.</p>

<h3>Paradise of Light and Freedom: A Glimpse of the Electrical Industry in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper in Hangzhou, February 24th] In the prosperous southeastern region, there is a widespread power shortage problem. Major cities and towns such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai cannot supply electricity smoothly, and they have to control electricity consumption and implement power outages by district in order to maintain the current electricity supply. For example, Nanchang, which was recently reached by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which the reporter has visited, often has to implement power outages by district, and even in areas that are not subject to power outages, the electric lights can only be as dim as a candle.</p>
<p>Before the war, there were more than 100 power plants in Zhejiang Province, including those in various counties and towns. After the war, only 24 or 25 of them have been restored, which shows how difficult the recovery is. However, the Hangzhou Power Plant can</p>
<p>Supply Freely</p>
<p>and has abundant energy. This is indeed an outstanding achievement in the midst of widespread power shortages. According to the person in charge of the Hangzhou Power Plant, "Before the war, the plant was the largest private electrical enterprise in Zhejiang, with two power plants, Zhakou and Genshanmen, with a generating capacity of 17,000 kilowatts. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], when the Japanese invaders invaded, the National Army automatically damaged two 7,500-kilowatt generators at the Zhakou Power Plant, along with all the attached equipment. During the period of the Japanese occupation, the plant's business was occupied by the enemy, who used the 2,000-kilowatt generator at Genshanmen to generate electricity, and the stored materials were almost completely looted. More than one-third of the transmission lines in various districts were destroyed or stolen, including more than 5,000 poles and more than 100 miles of wire. In addition, the low-voltage lines in small streets and alleys were mostly replaced with iron wire by the enemy due to the high price of copper at the time, resulting in low voltage and dim lighting. Fortunately, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the plant quickly took over and resumed operations, giving priority to repairing the machinery that had been destroyed during the war, and actively rectifying the high and low voltage lines in various districts to restore the original total generating capacity before the war."</p>
<p>Now the plant's two 7,500-kilowatt generators have been</p>
<p>Fully Repaired</p>
<p>, totaling 15,000 Cairo kilowatts. In terms of energy, this is still far from the current electricity consumption standard in Hangzhou, so they can cope with it easily and smoothly. In Shanghai, which is adjacent to Hangzhou, neon lights are being used sparingly, and power outages are being implemented by district in the Nanshi area of ​​South Shanghai, and electricity consumption by factories is also restricted. However, Hangzhou has not felt this difficulty. When you stroll on every important street at night, the red and green neon lights dazzle your mind, and at the same time, factories, shops, and households in Hangzhou can use electricity continuously. According to people in the electrical industry, there are probably only two cities in the whole country where the electrical industry can cope so easily: Taiwan and Hangzhou, and Taiwan is powered by hydropower, while Hangzhou is powered by thermal power. The reporter became keenly interested in this power plant, which provides light and freedom to the 500,000 citizens of Hangzhou, and went to Zhakou, ten miles away, for a visit.</p>
<p>Zhakou Power Plant</p>
<p>The towering four-story building stands on the banks of the Qiantang River. The plant building covers an area of ​​approximately 120 feet long and 140 feet wide, and is divided into four departments: boiler room, turbine room, power distribution room, and office. There are three vacuum devices, using steam capacity, each capable of extracting 50 pounds of gas per hour. There is also a slate, equipped with various important meters for the turbine, such as steam pressure gauges, vacuum gauges, and temperature gauges. There are three boiler feed water machines, two powered by electricity and one powered by steam, each with a capacity of 100,000 pounds of water per hour. On the left is a flat pipe for the main water inlet pipe, and three true pipes, which are the outlet pipes for each machine. This machine is installed in the bottom layer of the Qiantang River, and the water is returned to the river after being used by the machine. There are five main control panels, manufactured by the British B.T.H factory. All the main switches and meters for generators, transmission lines, and factory transformers are installed on the panels. It is the</p>
<p>Electrical Hub</p>
<p>of the entire plant. There are two turbine generators, each with 7,500 Cairo kilowatts, a steam pressure of 350 pounds per square inch, and a steam temperature of 720 degrees Fahrenheit. The generators are directly connected by the power generation method, which is three-phase, 50 Hz, and 14,000 volts. There are three single-phase transformers, each weighing 500 KVA, with a voltage of 14,000 to 600 volts. The three transformers are interconnected to supply current to all the plant's auxiliary machines. There is an auxiliary machine distribution board, where all switches, meters, heat meters, and wind meters for all the plant's auxiliary machines are centrally managed. The plant's</p>
<p>Main Fuel</p>
<p>is coal, so there is a coal mill that grinds the coal into powder and sends it to the boiler for combustion. Each mill can grind 6,000 pounds of coal per hour. This mill is driven by a motor to feed coal, and the amount is limited by a gate. If all the machines in the plant are fully opened, 3,000 tons of coal are needed. Now the Fuel Supply Committee only supplies 2,000 tons, and when you go to Nanjing to collect it, only 1,400 tons are allocated. The insufficient amount is solved by seeking plant oil. Now the price of coal is 3.9 million yuan per ton, while the price of oil is 8 million yuan per ton. But one ton of oil is equivalent to two tons of coal, and if you burn oil, you can save a lot on labor costs. The reporter asked why not burn all oil? The engineer in charge replied that the machines are limited to burning coal, so the coal and oil are burned together. The plant has about 60 workers in the turbine room power plant, about 68 repair workers, plus more than 100 external technicians, and more than 100 staff members, totaling about 400 people. The highest base salary for workers is 60 yuan and the lowest is 30 yuan. However, the workers in the plant treat the staff as family members and treat the machines and plants as their own homes. They are kind and cordial, so there are no labor disputes. The reporter met a pipe worker in the Bangpu Pumps room who was already gray-haired. He learned that he had been a worker here since the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. In order for both labor and management to develop feelings, live in peace, and overcome difficulties together, all problems can be solved easily as long as everyone is open and honest under the principle that both labor and management are like family members.</p>
<p>The result of the Hangzhou Power Plant's operation is that both income and expenditure can be managed. However, due to</p>
<p>Lack of Meters</p>
<p>, new households cannot be installed, which greatly affects business. These meters need to be purchased from abroad. Based on the current exchange rate, ordering 2,000 units would cost more than 5 billion yuan in national currency. The plant cannot bear such a huge number.</p>
<p>Currently, the most important issues for the Hangzhou Power Plant, in the reporter's personal opinion, are fuel and electricity theft. Fuel shortages can affect power generation, and Hangzhou's light and freedom may be lost, so we are eager for northern coal to open up its channels and be transported south quickly. If that is not possible, we hope that the Pingxiang coal mine can be mined quickly, and even the coal deposits in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi can absorb idle capital and be encouraged to develop as much as possible, so that the electrical industry, the mother of Southeast industry, may have a greater future.</p>
<p>Electricity Theft</p>
<p>: According to the person in charge of the plant: "Currently, electricity theft accounts for one-eighth of the total power generation. If the stolen electricity is supplied to users, 10,000 households can benefit. These electricity thieves have special powers, and there is really no way to stop them." For the development of public utilities and for the citizens of Hangzhou to always have light and freedom, we have reason to appeal to all sectors of society to impose sanctions!</p>
<p>The allocation of power generated by the Hangzhou Power Plant is approximately 55 percent for industry, 25 percent for households, and 20 percent for stores. Judging from this allocation, Hangzhou's industry is also growing, and we hope that the development of the electrical industry will promote the expansion of industry.

<h3>Jianyang Group Police Engage in Armed Fighting, Chengdu-Chongqing Traffic Temporarily Blocked</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Chengdu, February 25th] It has been reported that a few salt yard tax police officers in Jianyang, Sichuan Province were wandering on the streets a few days ago, and were interfered with by a patrol team from the local garrison district headquarters, who wanted to punish them for their untidy clothes. The two sides had a verbal conflict, and then each mobilized hundreds of group police officers, and dispatched more than a hundred machine guns and rifles, as well as hand grenades, etc., and launched a fierce street battle in Jianyang County. For a time, the whole county was closed and the Chengdu-Chongqing traffic was blocked. More than ten people were killed or injured on both sides.

<p>Another report: In Maogong County, western Sichuan, there was a fierce armed fight last year. One faction was the local Gelaohui leader Zhou Dingzhen, and the other was the vice-speaker of the county council and another Gelaohui leader Zhang Zhongchen. Hundreds of people were killed or injured on both sides, and Zhang's faction lost. This year, to retaliate, Zhang Zhongchen led more than a thousand "brother fellows" of the Gelaohui on the 23rd of this month, carrying various modern weapons, attacked Zhou's residence, and set it on fire. Then, the two sides launched another fierce armed fight. It is said that the participants in the battle each had thousands of people, all using weapons, including mortars and machine guns, etc. Many people were killed or injured. Maogong County was shocked many times overnight. The provincial government has now telegraphed the Maogong County government to stop it.</p>

<p>[Changsha, February 22nd] Xiong Wugong, the speaker of the Dayong County Council, who is recuperating from illness in Changsha, recently explained the Dayong incident, saying: The "May Seventh" incident was originally a conflict between the first and second squadrons of the Dayong police force. When the dispute occurred, Chairman Wang was traveling through Shimen. I coordinated with the county government to mediate the dispute, and the police team was immediately transferred from the city and stationed in Xiyong and Beizhen townships, and the situation calmed down. Later, entrusted by the people of the county to petition, I went to the provincial capital. I visited the chairman during a trip to Shimen and asked him to come to the county to investigate. After arriving in the provincial capital, I spent several months requesting the provincial government to subsidize the county with an insufficient fund of 160 million yuan, and return the borrowed accumulated grain of 15,000 dan. The Cilon Highway was also funded by the provincial government, and construction is scheduled to begin soon. After completing the task, my old illness relapsed. Regarding the position of speaker, I sent a telegram to the Department of Civil Affairs on July 10 of last year requesting my resignation, which was solemnly treated by Director Liu, who forwarded the original telegram to the county for comments, which has not yet been reported to the Department. On September 18, I sent another letter to Director Li asking him to forward it to Deputy Speaker Qu, who should have convened the meeting. I am still recuperating in the province, and rumors of fleeing are unfounded. I have received little education and have served the community for 30 years. I have always known how to value myself and have no desire to be a leader. I am not affiliated with any party, especially not the so-called leader of the B faction.</p>

<h3>Tragedy at Relief Distribution in Yanzhou: Five Refugees Trampled to Death While Receiving Aid</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Yanzhou, February 28th] Jining reported: An unprecedented tragedy occurred here. The Jining Relief Center, organized by the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, has been distributing supplies in place of porridge since before the Lunar New Year, and it has been going smoothly. However, because some of the relief tickets issued were not collected, the supervisory committee members were busy returning to the province to celebrate the Lunar New Year, resulting in a notice that was insufficient, and after returning on February 23, they continued to reissue them. However, the refugees mistakenly believed that it was a second round of relief distribution, and all gathered to receive it. By dawn on February 23, more than 10,000 refugees had gathered at the original site of the Eastern Great Temple Relief Center outside the city. After dawn, the number of people increased, causing the wooden bars outside the temple to break, and six elderly, weak, women, and children near the wooden bars were knocked to the ground and trampled to death. At that time, there were too few policemen to maintain order. After the crowd dispersed, rescue was carried out, but except for Zhu Liu, who was still barely alive, the other five were all dead, and the corpses were scattered, which was extremely tragic. Seeing the tragedy, the person in charge of the Relief Center immediately notified the District Court and the refugees' families to inspect and bury the bodies, and then transported the relief supplies back to the County Government for redistribution at a later date.</p>

<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Clarification</p>
<h3>The Issue of Men and Women Sharing Rooms in Hotels During the Winter Defense Period Lovers' Trysts Require Proof of Identity</h3>
<p>Yan Ziyu asks: Recently, the police局 has been rigorously inspecting旅舍 during the winter defense period. Occasionally, some unscrupulous police officers, with extortion in mind, deliberately create difficulties when they encounter men and women in the same room. Now, I have several legal questions and would appreciate your answers: (1) If a room is used for prostitution, are both parties committing a crime, and does the police局 have the right to detain them? (2) Is a lovers' tryst (with both parties having proper identification) prohibited, and is the police局 justified in detaining them and ordering their families to bail them out? Is this practice legal? (3) If a legally married couple (including cohabiting partners) cannot find housing and are staying with relatives, and they meet in a room on a holiday, is this against the law? (4) If a man and a woman are talking intimately in a room without any improper behavior, or if travel companions are in the same room but different beds, can the police局 arbitrarily cause trouble? (5) Can a citizen refuse to be interrogated or detained by a police officer for no crime, and what methods should be used to refuse?</p>
<p>[Answer from Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi] (1) If a room is used for prostitution and the person renting the room is an unmarried man (i.e., without a spouse), and the prostitute is an official prostitute (with a license), then neither party should be considered guilty. (2) In a lovers' tryst, not only must both parties' identification cards be presented, but proof of their identities (i.e., age, family details, etc.) must also be provided. If they are single men and women, it should not be prohibited. (3) Legally married couples have the right and obligation to live together, so it is naturally not a crime. However, cohabitation should be included in the second question. (4) If a man and a woman are talking intimately or travel companions are in the same room and there is no improper behavior, they are naturally not in violation of the law. (5) In the above situations, the police can investigate according to the police law; if they exceed their authority, they should be held accountable for abuse of power and obstructing freedom. Difficulties may arise because the police's training and education are not perfect and they are not accustomed to using the constitution.</p>
<h3>Postal Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>This bureau has received letters of inquiry from (1) Mr. Lu Yanqing of this city and (2) Mr. Zhang Jiping of this city, and we hereby answer the points they raised as follows:</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) For postal items marked "to be delivered by a certain ship," unless the sender has made a claim, regardless of how many times the ship's departure is postponed, it will still be kept for delivery by that ship, except when the postponement is indefinite. For those marked "to be delivered by a certain route," if that route encounters delays, the post office may change it to a faster route. However, for surface and sea mail to Europe and America, if the sender specifically names a certain ship, that ship must be a ship normally used for transporting mail in order to be processed accordingly. If not specifically named, the words "by a certain ship" or "by a certain route" should be added in red ink in the blank space on the cover, with a line underlined below to easily attract attention.</p>
<p>(2) (A) The dates and times for sealing and dispatching airmail to the United States are as follows: every Sunday: 19:00, Tuesday: 12:00 and 19:00, Wednesday: 8:00, Friday: 19:00, and the first and third Wednesdays of each month: 13:00. (Registered airmail is sealed and dispatched one hour earlier.) (B) Packages to the United States can arrive in about twenty days. (C) International reply coupons sent from the United States can be exchanged at the stamp window of this局 for a regular overseas letter stamp.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Military Training Alumni Association Established Wu Tiecheng Attends and Encourages Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] In the years 1935, 1936, and 1937, graduating high school students in Shanghai were concentrated for three months of military training. In these three years, a total of over 15,000 students received this training, including people from all provinces in the country. At that time, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng served as the Mayor of Shanghai and concurrently as the Commander of the First Military Training Corps and the Honorary Commander of the Second and Third Corps. Now, former officers and students such as Li Xiangqi initiated the establishment of an alumni association, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 29th) at the Ningbo Township Association. Mr. Wu was invited to attend the meeting and delivered the following speech: "Chairman, fellow students: It has been more than ten years since I last saw you. I served as your commander or honorary commander, and I will always consider it an honor. Today, I am suddenly reunited with you to celebrate the establishment of the alumni association, and I feel especially happy. More than ten years ago, you were still students, inspired by national consciousness, and enthusiastically participated in centralized military training. More than 15,000 students in Shanghai have received military training, including people from all provinces. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I learned that many students who had received military training participated in the war in various places, and I also know that many students who had received military training sacrificed themselves for the country in the war.</p>
<p>Glorious Historical Deeds</p>
<p>Taking the Battle of Shanghai as an example, our students who remained in Shanghai participated in the 36th Division of Song Xilian and the 87th Division of Wang Jingjiu, resisting foreign invaders and creating brilliant war records. This can be considered the most glorious event in the history of student military training. Looking back now, it still makes people excited. After more than ten years of separation, you have mostly progressed from the era of young students to the prime of life serving the country and society. This era is the most crucial stage in the life process. At this stage of life, whether it is serving society and the country or creating and developing personal careers, the key to success or failure lies in it. There is a close relationship between the country, society, and individual careers. If the country has a future, then we all have a future. You are in the prime of your lives, especially in today's China, a country facing many difficulties and striving for prosperity. The deeper the inspiration and training you receive from this era, the greater the success of your future careers will be. As the saying goes: 'At thirty, one stands firm; at forty, one is no longer perplexed.' You are at a time when you should be making great achievements, and you must deeply understand the era of China today, as this has a great relationship with the success or failure of your future careers. The goal that the Chinese people demand of the revolution is to build an independent, democratic, free, prosperous, and happy Three Principles of the People's country. The Chinese Kuomintang and the people of the whole country have been striving in this correct direction in the revolutionary movement for more than fifty years. Past history tells us that no matter what difficulties and setbacks we encounter, we can overcome them with the spirit of revolution. If we encounter difficulties and setbacks, and we are bewildered, depressed, or颓唐消沉, then we are not worthy of being called revolutionary party members, nor are we patriotic youth who shoulder the great mission of the era, and at the same time, we cannot save the country from danger.</p>
<p>Now China is facing a serious juncture in history. In other words, the Chinese revolutionary movement is approaching a stage close to success, but it has suffered a major blow, which is the all-out rebellion of the Communist Party. The Chinese people have undergone eight years of long-term resistance to Japan, endured the greatest disaster, and need a peaceful and unified country after victory, so that the people can recuperate and the government can concentrate its strength on復興建設. In order to seize power and overturn the government, the Chinese Communist Party has raised troops in rebellion and destroyed China's peace and unity. In order to protect the country's unity and peace, the government has the responsibility to suppress the rebellion, so we must clearly recognize that suppressing the rebellion is by no means a party struggle.</p>
<p>Two Roads of Life and Death</p>
<p>The Chinese people, especially the educated youth of China, must clearly understand the path they take at this critical juncture of national governance, chaos, prosperity, and decline. Now China only has two roads, the road to life is the great road of the Three Principles of the People to save the country and build the country, and the road to death is the road taken by the scourge of the country and people, the bandit-like Communists. If we take the wrong path, China will become part of a totalitarian political country, just like the situation of the vassal states of Eastern Europe today. There is no, nor should there be, a third road. The so-called middle road is actually a徘徊徬徨 side road, that is, the road to waiting for death. Moreover, some people who advocate the middle road are invisibly being used by the Communist Party to divide and dismember the revolutionary forces of China without realizing it.</p>
<p>China's revolution,復興建設, does not allow for further delay. Looking back at the 37 years since the founding of the Republic of China, China has missed the best opportunities for revival and construction twice: First, if it were not for the forces of warlords and feudal remnants such as Yuan Shikai, which caused destruction of the law and chaos and years of civil war, hindering China's peaceful reunification and construction, then China's democratic politics would have embarked on the right track earlier; Second, after the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1926, which destroyed the forces of warlords, bureaucrats, and feudal remnants, promoting China's unity, China entered a new氣運. If it were not for the Communist Party occupying Jiangxi, raising troops in rebellion, and the invasion of Japanese imperialism, which triggered eight years of long-term resistance to Japan, China's construction to remove the old and布新 could have laid its foundation.</p>
<p>Good Opportunity for Revival</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it should have been China's third opportunity for revival and construction. The abolition of unequal treaties, the increase in international status, and the eagerness of the government and the people to seek governance were truly rare opportunities to turn the tide of the nation. The Communists understood that the existence of this opportunity was very unfavorable to their intentions and attempts, so they did everything possible to destroy peace and unity, and even launched a full-scale rebellion, which is China's misfortune and the people's misfortune.</p>
<p>The Chinese people must concentrate their strength, seize this good opportunity for national revival and construction, and not make the same mistake again and again, and let it be destroyed again and lost. We must not only strive for today, but also strive for tomorrow. In other words, we must not only take care of the present, but also take care of the future. China's hope lies in the patriotic youth of China today. We must call on the educated youth to unite under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the only leader of China today, to enrich the revolutionary forces, seize this good opportunity for revival and construction, suppress the rebellion and achieve national peace and unity as soon as possible, and consolidate the foundation of democracy and freedom; in this way can we ensure the stability of people's livelihoods and national construction. You are all at a time when you are in the prime of your life and are the backbone of all sectors of society. You should first unite, call on the youth of the whole country, participate in the work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, and complete the mission of the national revolution. We must always be vigilant together and encourage each other." After Mr. Wu finished his speech, the general assembly began to discuss the charter and passed the appointment of 31 directors, including Li Xiangqi, Ge Mingda, Zhang Xinyu, Zhu Zhenguo, and Wu Shichang, and nine supervisors, including Tao Yishan and Li Zixiang. Finally, after reading a telegram of respect to the chairman, the meeting adjourned. The original telegram is as follows: "Chairman Chiang, may you be well. Retracing the history of your leadership of the revolution and the control of the nation's機, beginning with the Northern Expedition, guided by the War of Resistance, leading the marshals and winning victories. Despite the difficulties of the country's progress, we all look up to your宏濟, rescuing the people from the depths of suffering, achieving庆来苏. Now that the suppression of the rebellion is in full swing, the安宁 remains to be achieved. These remaining bandits, how can they be allowed to跳梁? The people of the whole country are deeply indignant! Students have received 教战,寧辞請纓, with all sincerity, we plan to form a聯誼, so that our comrades may be able to声应气求, and effect驰驱, to jointly plan for the suppression of the rebellion and the building of the country. We respectfully offer our respects and ask for your wise insight. The inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Military Training Alumni Association kowtows,印."</p>

In the second game, Jianle lost to Indian with a score of 31 to 48. In the final game, Renyu played against the US Air Force, with Renyu winning against the US Air Force with a score of 54 to 47.</p>
<p>In the game between Peier and Yizhong, Peier took the lead with a score of 6 to 2, but Yizhong counterattacked and surpassed with a score of 8 to 6. In the first half, Yizhong trailed by one point with a score of 16 to 17. After changing sides to fight again, the two teams continued to rise and fall. When time ran out, Peier defeated Yizhong with a score of 41 to 39.</p>
<p>In the game between Jianle and Indian, the foreign soldiers were active and took the lead with a score of 5 to 0. Jianle's counterattack was ineffective, and they trailed with a score of 5 to 20 in the first half. After the break, Jianle tried to cheer up, but Indian also had considerable gains. As a result, Jianle was defeated with a score of 31 to 48.</p>
<p>In the Group A1 game between Renyu and the US Air Force, the US military施威 and took the lead with a score of 7 to 0. Renyu's counterattack was still ineffective. After a score of 9 to 2, Renyu gradually started to improve and surpassed with a score of 10 to 9 after scoring eight consecutive points. In the first half, the US Air Force was now trailing with a score of 20 to 30. After changing陣 to fight again, the Air Force seemed to be smoother. Renyu calmly dealt with it, and the difference between the two sides remained at around ten points. The US military's actions gradually became abnormal, and Li Mengpei and Gan were both penalized and left the塲. When time was up, Renyu defeated the US Air Force with a score of 54 to 47.</p>
<h3>Soccer Match Again Hindered by Rain Yesterday</h3>
<p>The soccer match, which had been silent for many days, was originally scheduled to be held yesterday morning at the Yiyuan and Zhongzheng Park stadiums. However, the wind and rain were very mischievous. All day long, there was spring rain and strong wind, which prevented all the matches. The authorities of the Central Office temporarily issued a notice to postpone all of them.</p>
<h3>US Seven University Games Creates New Track and Field Records</h3>
<p>[United Press, Kansas, 28th] Former Navy pilot Gadesay, representing Missouri University, won the 60-yard low hurdles championship at the Seven University Indoor Track and Field Games today with a time of 6.8 seconds, reducing the world and American record set by Stickel in 1943 by one-tenth of a second. At the same time, Gadesay also set a new record of 7.4 seconds for the 60-yard high　.</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Capital for Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises Extended to the End of March</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Government previously stipulated methods for revaluing fixed assets and adjusting capital for industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises. It was stipulated that enterprises in these sectors, when facing one of the following situations, could revalue their existing fixed assets to adjust their capital: (1) When price fluctuations cause existing capital to be insufficient for operational turnover, requiring the issuance of new shares; (2) When expanding business operations requires the issuance of new shares; (3) When merging with other organizations requires a capital readjustment. The above revaluation and capital increase were limited to one instance only and were originally scheduled to be completed within the 36th year. The Municipal Social Bureau has now been ordered to extend the deadline to the end of March of this year.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Unified Cotton Purchase Area; Yarn Control Bureau Establishes Offices; Estimated Cotton Stockpile in this City Exceeds 400,000 Bales</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To strengthen the control over unified purchase and sales, the Yarn Control Bureau has decided in its fourth committee meeting to expand the implementation area for unified cotton purchase from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan to all regions where the Bureau has offices. Therefore, new offices are being actively established in various locations. It is learned that the Wuxi office of the Bureau is scheduled to be formally established on March 1st, the Guangzhou office was reorganized and established on February 21st, and the Wuhan office is also scheduled to be reorganized and established on March 1st.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to related sources, the total cotton stockpile in this city is estimated to be around 450,000 piculs. Among these, approximately 280,000 piculs have already been registered. Unregistered cotton accounts for approximately 20,000 piculs. The amount purchased by the Yarn Control Bureau is approximately 150,000 piculs.</p>
<h3>The Rebirth and Support of Taiwanese Coal</h3>
<p>Exploration in New Mining Areas</p>
<p>Taiwan's coalfields are located predominantly in the northern region, stretching from Keelung to the Daan River in Hsinchu County, spanning a north-south line of 160 kilometers. Although the area is quite extensive, the geological strata are extremely unstable, and the trends are inconsistent. The thickness of each layer is at most only about three feet, with an average thickness of only about one and a half feet. Each layer is also separated by rock strata of several tens of meters. These natural limitations explain the difficulty of mining operations. Moreover, the mining areas are extremely scattered. The largest mine can only produce 8,000 metric tons per month, while the smallest produces only 30 to 50 tons per month, appearing exceptionally small compared to those in Northeast and North China. Consequently, while the province produces over 100,000 tons of coal per month, there are over two hundred mining units. Under these circumstances, fully adopting modern mechanized production methods is naturally impossible. The coal mining area, from the Japanese occupation period to the present, is concentrated in the northern counties of Taiwan (including Keelung and Ruifang). Many coalfields have been explored for a century, with horizontal pits reaching depths of over 1,000 meters and inclined shafts extending over 3,000 meters. Due to the small scale and the inability to utilize mechanical equipment, the production of these old pits is inevitably declining. Therefore, the Department of Reconstruction has allocated funds to cooperate with the Geological Research Institute in exploring the Hsinchu mining area, and to conduct exploratory production simultaneously. However, coal mine development cannot be achieved in the short term, and it is expected to take at least a year before supplies can be obtained from the new mines. The current policy for coal mines should be a two-pronged approach: developing new mines while actively increasing production in existing ones.</p>
<p>Therefore, the task of actively producing in existing mines and supporting mine owners becomes extremely important. This task is fully undertaken by the Coal Adjustment Committee, which is directly under the Provincial Government. Its responsibilities include coordinating fuel control policies, handling unified purchase and sales operations, and incorporating support into adjustment work. The reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Committee, inquiring about production support issues. According to them, in addition to regulating supply and demand, the Committee provides as much protection and assistance as possible to small mine operators. Its main business related to increasing production can be divided into three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Coal Price Adjustment: Coal prices can be divided into domestic sales and export sales. The domestic sales price is the purchase price, which is increased by NT$200 per ton (this NT$200 is for management fees). The purchase price is determined based on the actual cost of the operators, plus 30% to 40% profit. The basis for each price adjustment is based as much as possible on the opinions of the Coal Mining Association. The latest purchase price has been increased to NT$11,000 per ton for special-grade coal seams. Export prices are determined entirely by the Shanghai Fuel Control Committee. All profits from export coal, after the Coal Committee extracts 5% for management fees, are distributed to coal mine operators. This measure has been implemented since December of last year.</p>
<p>(2) Supply of Equipment: The Committee has also made considerable efforts in this regard. The most lacking material in Taiwan's coal mines is smokeless safety explosives. In addition, mechanical equipment, boilers, and steel rails are also urgently needed. At the end of last year, the Committee borrowed US$100,000 in foreign exchange from the Central Bank to purchase explosives, which can be purchased this spring and used for the whole year, lacking little else. Steel cables and steel rails are also being acquired and distributed to private coal mines at reasonable prices, so as not to hinder production due to lack of equipment. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Review of the Issue of Collaboration between Private Sector and Scientific Engineering</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiyan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lu Yudao's article "Collaboration between Private Sector and Scientific Engineering" in the Ta Kung Pao on January 26th, I cannot help but deeply admire Mr. Lu's foresight and earnest words, which aroused sympathetic resonance and prompted a response.</p>
<p>Under the current situation of widespread war and suffering, scientific workers have not received active encouragement from the government. In the current period of emphasis on military affairs, there is naturally even less hope for improvement in the short term. Promoting collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering at this time is indeed the only way out of the frustration of scientific workers in the country today.</p>
<p>How can we promote collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering? The author will only briefly discuss some initial views, hoping to attract greater ideas and encourage scientific experts to discuss and offer more concrete and brilliant opinions together. Popularize scientific knowledge among the public.</p>
<p>Popularize scientific knowledge among the public.</p>
<p>Although today's public in the country is no longer the same as it was thirty years ago, with industrials trained in science being commonplace, this is only a part of the larger cities. The public in the vast regions of the country still knows nothing about science. This is certainly due to the lack of universal education, but popularizing scientific knowledge among the public is undoubtedly more difficult than simply eliminating illiteracy and promoting literacy in universal education. At least students above the secondary school level can engage in scientific research. Therefore, scientific workers and the public still seem to be separated by a chasm. There are still very few scientific publications that are suitable for the general public to read; some are only readable by specialized scientists. It can be seen that the majority of the public does not even know that there is such a thing as science. To promote collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering, we scientific workers must approach the public and delve into the grassroots, using accessible promotional materials to make the public recognize and become interested in scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Promote the industrial sector's understanding of science.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the atomic age, the distance on Earth has been shortened, and the concept of a global village is becoming increasingly close. The superiority and inferiority of international competition in industry and commerce are also becoming increasingly obvious. If China's industrial products do not seek improvement through scientific methods, and if the cost of labor and raw materials cannot be compared with those of others, not only will it be impossible to compete with foreign goods in the future, but there is simply the danger of being eliminated and unable to exist. Currently, apart from a few industrial sectors in larger cities that have scientifically trained talents, the understanding of using scientific methods to improve industrial production is still not widespread throughout the entire industrial sector. Therefore, when the government cannot encourage and support private research, domestic scientific workers should still contribute their knowledge to the industrial sector, arousing the industrial sector's widespread understanding of science, and then further continue research work, so that scientists and the industrial sector can develop close cooperation.</p>
<p>Lead the industrial sector to invest in scientific research.</p>
<p>Due to inflation, there is an overabundance of idle funds in the market, leading to economic instability. Conversely, investment in industrial production is only decreasing. This is also because there are many problems with labor and raw materials in the industrial sector, resulting in high production costs and the inability to make profits. Therefore, there is little interest in investment. However, if this continues unabated, it will be very dangerous for the future of China's industry. To solve this problem, it is necessary to increase production and reduce costs, which relies on scientific research and invention. There is no shortage of scientific geniuses and inventors in the country, nor is there a shortage of raw materials. It is just that research and invention require considerable time and economic resources. If the industrial sector takes a long-term view and can jointly invest in scientific research work, like foreign countries, and gather the huge capital of industrial capitalists to establish large-scale scientific research laboratories, it is believed that the achievements of future inventions will definitely have considerable value in industry. Then the future of China's industry and the future of the country's scientific development will be very hopeful.</p>
<p>Establish laboratories as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There are many well-known scientific organizations in the country, among which the China Science Society, the Chinese Society for Arts and Sciences, and the Chinese Society of Natural Sciences have long histories and gather excellent scientific experts in the country. However, the entire group rarely has contact with private industrial sectors in peacetime. Therefore, under economic constraints, not only can most scientific experts not have private research rooms like foreign scientists, but even wanting to establish several experimental research rooms by the group is still far from success due to funding and other issues. Therefore, under the slogan of promoting collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering, on the one hand, it is hoped that scientific organizations with many scientific experts will have closer contact with private industrial organizations in the future. On the other hand, it is hoped that private industrial sectors with a long-term view will cooperate with the research plans of scientific organizations that have demonstrated existing achievements and existing scientific experts, providing capital and establishing various research laboratories as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In short, when the country's financial resources cannot focus on scientific research in the near future, only in this way can domestic scientific workers avoid sighing "uselessness" and can the private industrial sector have hope of opening up new avenues in the future crisis. Science and industry are closely related and mutually dependent. Let us all quickly call for the slogan of "collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering" and work together to make it a reality!</p>
<h3>The Water Tower at Sun Moon Lake</h3>
<h3>Unexpected Scientific Discoveries</h3>
<p>— Ye Lei</p>
<p>Saccharin</p>
<p>C. Fahlberg worked in the laboratory for a whole day. He was hungry and, without washing his hands, hurriedly picked up a piece of bread and ate it. Strangely, the bread he ate at that time was particularly sweet compared to what he usually ate. Because he was eager to go back to his experiment, he ate quickly and didn't pay attention while eating.</p>
<p>After finishing the bread, he poured a glass of water to drink. At this time, he saw that his hands were very dirty. Then he recalled the special sweetness he had just tasted and tasted his own hands and the things he had picked up while eating the bread. He knew that the sweetness came from his dirty hands, and that the dirt on his hands was from being stained with chemicals during the experiment. So he immediately checked the chemicals he had used during the experiment and, as a result, discovered a very sweet new substance called "saccharin."</p>
<p>Bakelite</p>
<p>One night, in Dr. L. Baekeland's laboratory, a pair of lazy cats, wanting to steal food, jumped onto the medicine shelf and knocked over a bottle of formalin solution. The cat was frightened and ran away. Underneath the bottle of formalin solution, there happened to be a mousetrap with fragrant cheese inside to lure mice. The formalin solution poured on top of it immediately caused a change, producing a hard new substance.</p>
<p>The next morning, Dr. Baekeland saw this new substance and was very surprised. After checking, he realized that it was formed by the combination of the formalin solution and the cheese. He thought that such a hard substance could definitely be used to manufacture daily necessities, which aroused the motivation for research, and as a result, he invented "Bakelite."</p>
<p>Stainless Steel</p>
<p>During World War I, H. Brearley wanted to forge a very hard steel to manufacture guns. He repeatedly mixed chromium and steel and put them into the furnace for forging experiments. However, the chromium steel he forged was not very hard. At that time, he didn't care and threw it away.</p>
<p>Later, one day, his assistant was cleaning up the accumulated garbage and suddenly saw some shiny things mixed in the pile of garbage. He picked them up and saw that they were the chromium steel that had been discarded before. He thought that steel would normally rust in such a humid pile of garbage, but the chromium steel hadn't rusted, so mixing chromium into the steel could definitely prevent rusting. Therefore, he focused on research and invented "stainless steel."</p>
<p>Penicillin</p>
<p>Nineteen years ago, Professor Alexander Fleming was cultivating grape-like cocci when suddenly a small spore of Penicillium flew in from the window and landed in a petri dish. Perhaps because Penicillium was common, Professor Fleming didn't remove it at the time. Later, this small spore slowly grew into a wheel-shaped Penicillium and secreted a magical new substance that killed or conquered nearby grape-like cocci, rendering them immobile.</p>
<p>When Professor Fleming discovered this new substance, he was very excited. He put the pair of Penicillium in broth and cultivated them, and the results proved that the magical new substance it secreted did have bactericidal effects. So he continued to study it together with many scholars. After more than ten years, in 1940, Aorauam and others refined it and dedicated it to medical use, saving countless patients. This new drug is called "Penicillin."</p>
<p>Some scientific inventions are accidental, which is indeed the inventor's luck. However, the fact that inventors can seize this luck and focus on research is due to their usual research skills. It is accidental, but not accidental.</p>
<h3>The Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— H.K. Zhou</p>
<p>When a winding road like a yellow snake stretches all the way from the mountainside into the clouds, and even the car is panting as it climbs, you will definitely think you have reached a monotonous and lonely mountaintop. But what unfolds before you is a scene of beautiful lakes and mountains—Sun Moon Lake. Can you imagine that on this mountain at an altitude of 745 meters, there is such a beautiful "West Lake"?</p>
<p>Sun Moon Lake, unlike West Lake, does not only have beautiful scenery, like a classical Chinese beauty; nor does it only have water power, like Niagara Falls in the United States, like an 18th-century classical scientist. It has both, just like a forward-moving woman of the new era. Sun Moon Lake is neither a completely natural lake nor a completely artificial lake. It is a combination of both. It was discovered by a mountain tribe called the Bu Ji 273 years ago. At that time, the deepest part of the lake was only 27 meters. The perimeter was 24 kilometers. Later, the Japanese discovered that its terrain could be used to generate electricity. So they started constructing water conservancy projects, building dikes in the surrounding mountain depressions, and diverting water from the surrounding mountains into the lake. As a result, the entire valley became a lake, and the water level rose by 70 meters. The perimeter expanded to 30 kilometers, and many mountain peaks were submerged in the tide. Therefore, the Daguan Power Plant was built 19 kilometers from Sun Moon Lake. Five large water pipes were used to guide the water down from Sun Moon Lake, using the water's potential energy to drive five huge generators capable of generating more than 20,000 kilowatts of electricity. The water used by the Daguan Power Plant was then used for electricity generation a second time, and the Jugong Power Plant was built in Shuilikeng, 8 kilometers from Daguan, where the terrain is even lower. The water was used to generate electricity through two large water pipes. The electricity generated by the two plants was then combined and distributed to all parts of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Sun Moon Lake's water conservancy equipment is very complete, and the water level can be adjusted freely without being affected by rainfall. The water level can be raised or lowered by as much as 50 meters. The water level is highest in February and lowest in April and May, so electricity can be generated all year round. The generators and outlets also have special equipment. Automatic regulators are installed to ensure that the voltage and current are very uniform. According to the plant, it can now generate about 160,000 kilowatts of electricity. There is still a surplus for use in Taiwan Province. After the Kaohsiung Aluminum Plant recently started operations, or</p>
<p>Sitting on a train in Taiwan and looking out the window, you can see the high-voltage power lines of the large-scale project, which have a voltage of more than 40,000 volts! (Picture broadcast in this issue)</p>
<h3>The Magnificence of the Wujie Sluice Gate</h3>
<h3>A Record of Simple Scientific Experiments at Home</h3>
<p>— Liu Suisheng</p>
<p>After sunset, as the lights were lit, I sat with my family around the stove, enjoying the happiness of family life. When we were done, we engaged in scientific experiments for recreation.</p>
<p>At that time, I had a cigarette in my hand, and white smoke swirled, blowing directly above the stove. My son asked why, and my concubine replied that the air above the stove rises when heated, and cold air flies in to fill the space. For example, when the weather suddenly gets hot, a cool breeze follows. This experiment clearly demonstrates the cause of wind.</p>
<p>My son was playing with hot water, his hands dripping wet. I said: Come! Move your hand closer to the stove fire. At the same time, I ordered my daughter to take a paper fan and wave it at his hand, blowing the warm air from the stove onto his hand. My son said: "Before my hand dries, I feel cool; after it dries, I feel warm." I said: "This experiment shows that breathing or sweating can keep the body cool."</p>
<p>My son was playing with sand, with two small lead buckets. One was filled with sand, and the other with water. They were placed on the stove and heated to the same temperature, then moved to the table. I ordered my daughter to measure the temperature from time to time, and she said that the temperature dropped faster with the sand. My wife asked me with a smile, "What does this show?" I said, "Sand represents the continent, and water represents the ocean. This shows that the continental climate changes rapidly, and the oceanic climate is relatively mild."</p>
<p>My wife took scissors and cut out two paper figures. I ordered my daughter to paint one paper figure entirely with ink, and leave the other unpainted. Then I separately applied candle oil to the hands of the two paper figures, and positioned them on opposite sides of a candle flame. After a while, the flag in the hand of the black figure fell first. This clearly shows that black absorbs heat more easily, so dark-colored clothing is suitable for winter, and white is suitable for summer.</p>
<p>My son took ice water in an aluminum cup. I added table salt and asked him to stir it with chopsticks. Then I ordered my daughter to insert a thermometer. Before long, dew appeared on the outside of the cup, and the measured temperature was the dew point, which also indicates when rain and dew appear.</p>
<p>My daughter took a large glass bottle and threw burning pieces of paper into it, quickly sealing it with a wooden stopper with a bamboo tube. Blowing air in or sucking air out caused the smoke to rise or sink. This is because increasing or decreasing the pressure causes the smoke to rise or sink. Therefore, by observing the horizontal or vertical flight of cooking smoke, we can know whether a storm is coming.</p>
<p>The simple experiments on meteorology were temporarily suspended. My daughter suddenly said, "Our teacher said that scientific experiments should be done in a science museum."</p>
<p>I said, "Natural science takes matter as its object; people cannot live apart from matter, so scientific experiment materials are available anytime and anywhere, not limited to science museums. If science education is only a decoration for schools and cannot deeply penetrate the people, this is why I worry about the future of Chinese science."</p>
<p>After the experiments were finished, we smiled at each other and, after putting away the utensils, went to bed. The next day, I picked up my pen and wrote "A Record of Simple Scientific Experiments at Home."</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On "Professional Oppositionists"</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>The term "intellectual" seems to have gained considerable importance recently. In Ambassador Stuart's message to the Chinese people, he stated, "If Chinese intellectuals can form a progressive group to stimulate government decision-making, peace can be enhanced."</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart's few words, and the main point of his entire speech, are nothing more than an extension of General Marshall's declaration when he left China the year before, because General Marshall also indicated at the time that China's future depended on the cooperation between intellectuals and the government. General Marshall seemed to have added the adjective "enlightened and progressive" before "intellectuals."</p>
<p>However, this time Ambassador Stuart's remarks seem to go a step further, indicating that there are many gaps between the current government and intellectuals, which led to a defense by the new Director, Xian Guang, whose main point was that although Ambassador Stuart deeply understands the situation of my country's educational circles, it is too much to say that the government and intellectuals cannot cooperate. He also pointed out that the majority of Chinese intellectuals cooperate with the government, and although there are occasional people who cannot express sympathy for the government's measures, every country has "professional oppositionists," which cannot prove that Chinese intellectuals do not cooperate with the government.</p>
<p>The fact that Chinese intellectuals are receiving such attention at home and abroad may inevitably make them feel somewhat flattered. This is because Chinese intellectuals are currently in a period of unprecedented suffering in both material and spiritual life, and now they are actually being watched by friendly countries and valued by the government, which believes that China's future destiny must be entrusted to them. Isn't this surprising to them?</p>
<p>However, I personally have always said that the intellectuals of a country, no matter how despised by society in a certain era, will ultimately be indispensable. This is not to boast for intellectuals. Just look at even in countries that advocate class dictatorship, who holds the initial and final leadership? Can it escape the hands of intellectuals? Classifying people by economic life, perhaps every individual can be attributed to a certain class, but intellectuals are different.</p>
<p>Intellectuals may have so-called class consciousness, but in reality, it is not important, because as soon as power is in hand, the power of knowledge will outweigh class consciousness. The Soviet Union is an example. The Soviet Union is a country that claims to be a proletarian revolution, but the people who lead this revolution are actually a small number of intellectuals. Even the entire theory of proletarian revolution comes from the fantasies of a small number of intellectuals. Can you believe that Russian peasants who had just been liberated from serfdom would have any proletarian revolutionary consciousness? And today, all actions of the Soviet Union are by no means to protect the interests of some "proletarian motherland," but exactly like the leading intellectuals of other countries, only considering ordinary national interests.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is only a distinction between intellectuals in power and intellectuals out of power. Intellectuals in power are those who cooperate with the government, while those out of power are those whom George Bernard Shaw called "professional oppositionists." If my observation is correct, then the Chinese intellectuals whom some American public opinion criticizes for still having gaps with the government only refer to that group of "professional oppositionists."</p>
<p>However, to unite all intellectuals into "one front" is not only impossible, but also unnecessary. To be honest, the distinction between so-called democracy and undemocracy lies in how much tolerance a government has for "professional oppositionists," and not in expanding the government's foundation to accommodate all intellectuals.</p>
<p>For example, take the United States. The reason why the United States is called a democratic country is not because the foundation of the American government is built on a unified front of American intellectuals, but because the American government still has the tolerance to accommodate people like Wallace criticizing the government. However, for the American Communist Party, although the American government is democratic, its attitude of tolerance is limited. But this does not detract from the democratic spirit of American intellectuals in power. Why? Because American intellectuals in power know very well that if they switched places with the American Communist Party, even people like Wallace would probably have no room to exist.</p>
<p>The current problem of Chinese intellectuals is not how to bring all the "professional oppositionists" out of power into power, but whether there is tolerance for "professional oppositionists." And this, I am afraid, is precisely what some American public opinion is demanding of China.</p>
<h3>Children's Railway</h3>
<p>— Tong</p>
<p>According to the "Moscow News", the first children's railway in the Transcarpathian Mountains was inaugurated in Fanxu Zhendem, all the people from young drivers to stationmasters are composed of school-age children in the fourth to tenth grades. These children are progressing extremely fast in school. The teachers think they are satisfied before allowing them to participate in the children's railway work in their spare time. A small passenger train was built specifically for this railway.</p>
<h3>Strange</h3>
<p>— Fang Pu</p>
<p>During the Hu Tianqi years, in the hot sixth month, it snowed in the city of Wuqing County, Zhili, and the color of the clouds was scarlet red. The snow stopped after half an hour. At that time, the ministers of the court submitted a memorial, thinking that this was an omen of chaos in the world, and asked the emperor to love the people and reform politics to save the great calamity.</p>
<p>During the Xianfeng years of the Qing Dynasty, a family in Fengtian Jin County who was marrying a bride was taking the bridal sedan back. The journey was long, and they encountered heavy snow on the way, so they hid in an ancient temple in a nearby desolate mountain to rest temporarily. Who knew that the snow was getting heavier and heavier, blocking the way out of the mountains. These people got lost and could not get out. It took more than ten days for the snow to melt and the road to open. The men and women searched for them everywhere. A month later, they were found in this ancient temple. More than seventy people, including the bride and groom, musicians, and guests who welcomed and sent them off, had all starved to death inside. County magistrate Chen Chunxu went to examine the bodies in person and shed tears for them.</p>
<p>In the winter of the twentieth year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, a boat in Taihu Lake was frozen in the center of the lake by ice and snow and could not move. After about a month, the ice melted and the boat floated downstream, where it was discovered that everyone in the boat had starved to death, but there were still more than two stones of white rice left in the boat. It turned out that the fire was gone, so even though there was rice, they could not cook.</p>
<p>In the era of the Russian Empire, Siberia was the place where political prisoners were exiled, and its wind and snow were world-famous. A prison for political prisoners was built a bit low. In a certain year in the nineteenth century, there was heavy snow in Siberia, and it snowed for two days in a row. The snow on the ground was already five or six feet thick. In the evening, the sky cleared up, and everyone was relieved, thinking that it would be fine, but at night, the snow fell again, and it was even heavier than during the day. Overnight, the depth of the snow exceeded the roof of the low prison. The entire prison was deeply buried in the snow. More than 100 prisoners and managers all froze to death in their sleep. The next day, the prison was "missing." The local authorities were unable to visit due to the difficulties caused by the heavy snow. It was not until the snow began to melt and the roof of the prison was exposed that the mystery came to light. Later, the prison was dismantled, and the local authorities erected a stone tablet on the original site in memory of this event, engraved with the words "Snow Tomb."</p>
<p>In the winter of 1923, Oslo, the capital of Norway, experienced unprecedented heavy snow. The city accumulated 30 million tons of snow. More than 100,000 people were mobilized (almost all men over the age of fifteen in the city) to remove the snow, and it took more than forty days to clear it. During the heavy snow, the city's water pipes were all crushed by the snow, and the citizens boiled the snow in front of their doors to drink as tea. Food was also very scarce. Food from outside could not be transported in due to traffic disruption. The government borrowed several planes from the UK loaded with dry food and dropped it from the air in a public square in the city, which was distributed by the government to the common people.</p>
<h3>Yuan Hanyun Twenty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren</p>
<p>In the winter of the seventh year of the Republic of China, the great writer Yuan Hanyun and I met in Beidu, and we became acquainted at first sight. We talked about literature and characters, and the feeling was very pleasant. One day, Yuan prepared wine and invited me to drink. Bu Linwu, Zhu Xiaqing, and Xu Lingxiao were all present. Hanyun wore a jade-colored long robe, held a rosary in his hand, and his face was as white as jade. He was a suave and elegant gentleman. After that, he spread paper on the edge of the bed and made a union, writing in the air. His pen did not stop, and each character was powerful and vigorous, which was truly beyond the reach of others.</p>
<p>Halfway through the wine, Hanyun took out two volumes of Song Dynasty fish seal collections of poems and asked everyone to write poems. I was assigned the rhyme "snow" and immediately improvised: "The phoenix luo screen flies like jade layers, the shark silk is brocade and jade congealing spring snow, the bright red powder halo seems to enter the gods, the yellow clouds silk cover the girl's blood; although the remnants of the millennium are not edible, the paper light is dazzling and the words are fragrant, when brushing flowers late at night and chanting, it is like hearing the stocks diligently recognize the voice." After writing it on the collection, there were many titles at the time. The seal at the beginning of the collection said "Gao Erzi." I said to Hanyun, you are the prince, the seal is almost teasing, what is the meaning? Hanyun then took out his own poem and said: "Wearing fine cotton for the first time is better than self-sufficiency, the ancient wall is desolate and a railing relies on the land, the flying tai liquid heart has no stay, the clouds rise from the demonic cliff and the dream wants to win. Occasionally hearing distant flutes in distant forests, alone in the spiritual room turning bright lights, I especially pity the high places with more wind and rain, do not reach the top floor of the Qiong Building." The last couplet indicated his intention not to become emperor, using his strength to persuade his father but to no avail, and his eldest brother, one force advocated that nothing should be carried out safely, claiming that the crown prince was firmly in hand, because Hanyun wrote poems to advise, and advocated opposition, the hatred became deeper, almost playing out the story of Chen Siwang boiling beans and burning stalks, relying on this seal, showing consistency, and then he got the whole body, at that time, outsiders could not deeply understand the inside story.</p>
<p>Hanyun's calligraphy was especially outstanding, thin and hard, able to melt the ancient seal into a furnace and smelt it. He once sent me a letter on calligraphy, which said: "Calligraphy begins with seal learning, and those who learn calligraphy must begin with seal characters. The seal script is upright in style and meticulous in white, and after practicing it, attack others, so as to avoid the disease of weak and vulgar desolation. After the seal method is exhausted, then the official script will be used to contain it. When learning the official script, you should take the steles of the Western Han Dynasty. After the Eastern Migration, more attention is paid to the side charm, and the ancient meaning is gradually sparse. Advance to participate in the ancient grass, explore the source of the book to the extreme of the vertical and horizontal turning potential, and establish the foundation of the book, and the book will be completed with the six dynasties of calligraphy. The book of the Six Dynasties, especially the Northern Wei inscriptions, see the official posture and seal bones, which is regarded as the ancestral law of Kai, if the book of Zhong Wang, it is truly perfect, but the Kaishu passed down to the world is mostly seen in posts, posts are hooks and imitations, even if there is a good job, it is difficult to complete its spirit, steles are written on stone, you must keep its original, there is no slight loss, so take the truth of the Six Dynasties, abandon the false of Zhong Wang. The Sui and Tang inscriptions are well-constructed, and it is good to browse through them. The books of the Song and Yuan people are becoming more and more charming, with sharpness, not suitable for human stone, and the ink version is still worth seeing. The Ming people are even more exposed, and there are occasional teams of goblins. The Qing scholars were trapped in the posts and could not be surpassed, so the books were mostly confined and narrow. However, this is just a general statement, if there are strange and prominent scholars who are not confused by vulgar currents, peep into the hall of the ancients and become a family of their own, there are still people in the generation. Taking the true soul of the seal and official script and competing with Xijing, Daozhou is a thousand years old. After the Tang Dynasty, the books of famous families can be used for participation and play, but it is not enough to use as a teacher. People in the world abandon the fundamentals and pursue the ends, or imitate the Sanxi Hall, or imitate the Tanxi Shi'an generation, and if they get a slight resemblance, they will be self-proclaimed calligraphers, if they know the law of Dongpo Shangu Songxue Xianggong and other families, they will be more arrogant and proud of the high ancients, those who seek to know the Six Dynasties are already few, let alone the Three Dynasties Qin and Han. The ancient law has fallen, what else can be said!" In the Qing Dynasty, he only admired He Zizhen, not without seeing. After several years of separation, the old man exhausted his energy, and not long after, he heard that he had died at sea, and the ink left behind was rarely seen, which is a pity.</p>
<p>When the Japanese pirates were rampant, I took refuge in Shanghai. Occasionally, I and my old friend Jingzhai, in the Lengchou stall, obtained two volumes of Hanyun's diary. The printing was exquisite, the calligraphy was vigorous, and in addition to poetry and various styles, he was especially good at writing couplets, which was truly an excellent book. The association also involved Xiangcheng Dangguo, such as the rising sun, Yuan's silver coins, the credit was clear, the poor countryside was widely circulated, the people's hearts gradually felt stable, it is a pity that the emperor's desires suddenly expanded, the great cause collapsed, and the people were even more uneasy. The ancients said that all laws are only in the mind, and the turn of one mind can be seen immediately, and the relationship is truly small.</p>
<h3>Four Poems on Spring Rain</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>It just fell from the sky, and it is more sorrowful than in the old days, the three years of disturbance are still dangerous, and tonight the anger thunders: the bronze horse is spring neighing on the grass outside the pass, the painted eaves of the tile are peeling with taro ash, and for the time being, the land is large and far from the war, and there is hunger and cold on all sides.</p>
<p>The rain is intertwined and the collapsed plain is not willing to clear up, looking at the sky is also as depressed as a person, I pity the Chancellor of the sea labor, and I still regret that the reason is less in harmony with the ministers! Dare to say that the party is in the old age? Mihuizhong is not in the new discussion. I look at the border moon with anger and anger, and the unconscious common people are the most true.</p>
<p>Red lights spray fog all over Kyushu, and I will recognize the wolf star as my father Kun, it is futile to be chaotic and punish the white horse, and I will not forgive Zhu Wen when I take advantage of the danger; the sons are occupying the southeast emperor, and only one or two villages are left with chickens and dogs.</p>
<p>It is expected that the violent gas will show the barbaric punishment, and the generation of loyalty and adultery will be recorded in the book. It is necessary to divert the flow to the dirty officials, and also need to taste the courage to train new soldiers! The peeping of people is crowded, and the hall is turning around, and the clothes and hats of the dream are shocking every night; it is better to be a slight birth and worry about the unpredictable, and there will be no more wild and clear weeds in the mountains.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Full of Doubts, Eighty-Four</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai thought that the general Kunling and the people in the military and political circles were close, and the only ones who were well-known were Qiwan and Manying, and Lanfen. Lanfen has recently been ill and has gone to the hospital. Manying offended people because of her bad luck and went to Qingdao. Now only Qiwan and Miao Zhongjie are together. Outsiders are talking about it. This famous actress is mostly referring to Qiwan. After get off work that day, I took the newspaper and came to Qiwan's house. I asked the maid, Xiao Wangma, at the door, and she said that Qiwan had just returned not long ago and was taking a nap in the bedroom. When Zhu Zhai heard that she was sleeping, he didn't dare to go in, so he asked outside and asked Xiao Wangma about Qiwan's most recent situation. Xiao Wangma said in a low voice, "Don't ask, that Director Miao has a big temper. He scolds us and is not friendly at all. If he answers the phone a little late, he will scold us." Zhu Zhai listened and only shrugged his shoulders and said, "What does the boss mean? Why would he make friends with this kind of person? I want to persuade her today." Xiao Wangma quickly waved her hand and said, "You have to pay attention. The boss has not been in a good mood these days and gets angry at every turn!" Zhu Zhai said, "I mean well. It's about her future and reputation. I must persuade her and do my duty." When Zhu Zhai said this, his voice was a little louder. Qiwan had already heard it inside and asked, "Who is talking outside?" Xiao Wangma quickly replied, "It's Mr. Xu." When Zhu Zhai heard this, he pushed the door open and went in. He saw Qiwan lying on the bed, only covering the red brocade quilt to her chest, with her two arms completely exposed. He nodded to her and said, "Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?" Qiwan only shook her head slightly. Zhu Zhai sat down on the edge of her bed and said, "We haven't seen each other for several days. I brought a message today. Don't be angry when you see it. I think someone hates you and is fabricating rumors." As he spoke, he took out the newspaper and handed it to Qiwan. Qiwan looked at where he was pointing, and her face turned slightly red. She glared at Zhu Zhai, put the newspaper next to her pillow, and didn't say a word. Zhu Zhai said, "It's not clear how to publish it like this. Many people outside say it's about you. I want to clarify it. It's not worth it to take the blame for someone else!" Qiwan's face sank and she said, "This is not a wrong accusation. Director Miao did give me a big demerit!" When Zhu Zhai saw that Qiwan admitted it, he didn't know what to say. He stayed for a while and said, "I don't think there's any benefit in dealing with this kind of person. It's better to avoid him as soon as possible to avoid further trouble." Qiwan said, "I have my own reasons for getting to know him." Zhu Zhai said, "What reasons?"</p>
