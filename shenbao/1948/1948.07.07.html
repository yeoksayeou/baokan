<h3 id="c20">社論　重建陸軍　紀念七七 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>——首屆陸軍節感言</p>
<p>今天是七七抗戰紀念日，並爲首届睦軍節，全美各地除了悼念抗戰陣亡將士及死難同胞而外，並舉行大規模的勞軍運動。戡亂勞軍總會所組織的七七勞軍團，聞已自南京出發，前往華北東北前綫，慰勞我在前方艱苦戡亂的將士。</p>
<p>當此萬方多難之際，我們又遇到了我民族獨立運動史上最光榮最偉大的紀念日，眞是不勝今昔之感。自從蘆溝橋事件發生促成全面抗戰以來，迄今已歷十一個年頭；在抗戰八年期間，我們雖在艱苦抗戰，受盡一切的煎熬磨折；但是我們認爲抗戰是我民族生死有關的聖戰，並深信最後勝利必屬於我，所以每逢七七抗戰紀念日，總是非常興奮樂觀，咸以偷快的心情來鼓勵大家洗血洗汗，學取抗戰的勝利，每過一次七七，就覺得離開勝利門更近了。迨抗議勝利之後，我們也已紀念過兩次七七，今天是第三個了。我們在這三年之中，眼望着勝利之果，從開始霍爛到付諸東洗，大好國運一年不如一年，前年今日我們晞噓感慨，去年今日我們洗淚傷心，到了今年今日，緬懷過去抗戰的艱難，展望國家前途的　淡，幾乎非大家拘頭痛哭一塲，不足以發洩心頭的煩惱了！</p>
<p>然而，煩惱憂憤決不是辦法；我們須得重振精神，打出一條活路來。今天我們紀念七七，悼念抗戰陳亡將士及死難同胞，固然感　萬千，非常愧疚，但是儘作消極的表示而不能「知恥近乎勇」，決非我中華民族的好兒女。所以今天紀念七七，必須重振抗戰期間的精神，排除建國途中的障礙，以挽目前的狂瀾。軍事當局所以定今年七七爲首屆陸軍節，其意義當就在此。</p>
<p>我國自黄埔建軍之後，始有革命的陸軍可言，在革命北伐期閒，建立不少輝煌的功績，及至抗戰發動，我軍配備雖遠不如敵，但賴將士用命，終能擊敗强寇，不能不說是我國陸軍的大成功。八年戰績，在我民族獨立運動史上最光榮的一頁，永遠値得我們的懷念和自傲。一部份陣亡的將士，固已洗芳萬世，而大部份的將士，在抗戰勝利之後，不僅未能復員還鄉，且仍須在前綫艱苦戡亂。我們幾乎不能想像假如沒有這些忠勇的將士在那裏洗血　　，後方同胞勞將度着何種生活！所以我們對於今日仍在前綫艱苦戡亂的抗戰英雄，以及受傷　洽的榮軍同志，不能不表示無上的敬意。各地的勞軍運動，普　發動，僅表示衷誠敬意的萬一而已。</p>
<p>我們正規現　，檢討三年來的戡　軍事，却又使我們不能不主張重建陸軍。共匪勢力日形膨脹，由游擊戰變而爲陣地數，由破壞交通綫變而爲襲擊大據點，今年三月間共匪攻略洛陽以及最近一度竄入聞封，就是明證，再回頭君看國軍，似乎反由主動變爲被動，未能以逸待勞，亦未能以靜制動。兩相比較，不能促起全國上下對於如何挽回軍事頹勢的萬分關切。我們以爲主要關鍵，不外兩端：一在軍略問題，二在軍事行政間題。</p>
<p>關於前者，我們檢討量近一年來的戡亂軍事，不能不指出，國軍在剿匪作戰方面，很明顯的缺少機動性，致反爲共匪的「運動戰」所乘。但若國軍也能採取選動戰，就不難捕捉到匪軍的主力，達成殲滅戰的任務；五月初涇渭河谷的殲滅大捷，五月中旬宛西民團的初　鋒铓，就是一個匪證。目前中原大戰因爲開對的克復，固已挽回頹勢，但是共匪也正集中主力，妄圖一逞，國軍如欲捕捉共匪的主力，豫東會戰只要國軍將領不存保全實力的偏見，在統一指揮之原則下，把握戎機，充分發揮軍隊的機動性，也就不難一鼓殲敵了。戰略的改變，並不是一件難事，而最重要的，仍在軍事行政的改革。全國軍事綏靖會　令天在首都開幕，各地長官將部洶將出席，對於此一問題，　　　滿底加以檢討的必要。</p>
<p>以　軍事行政改革問題，目前國軍部隊，忠勇奮發，紀律嚴明的固有，而一般說來，風紀敗壞，士氣頹唐，士兵衣食悲劣，均已到了非加改善不可的階段。政府正在積極訓練新軍，自亦早鑒及此。何部長自國外歸來，就任國防部長之前，早就有改革　事行政的表示，及其就職之後，更提出三項具體計劃：（一）改善士兵衣食與訓練，以謀恢復士氣；（二）課各司令長官在戰塲上指揮與赏罰之全責，不使權力完全集中於中央，（三）結束不重才幹而重政治關係之陸遷習慣，而迅速擢升　秀將士。這三項辦法，切中時弊，均不失爲良策，但要在能切實執行。其實翁院長提出的施政方針，關於軍事方面，也提出四個原則：（一）繼續緬强兵力，（二）提高士兵待遇，（三）團結士氣，（四）扶植地方武力，充分發揮地方的保安力量，以協助戡亂國軍的作戰；這四項原則，如能切實辦到，也不難挽回今日軍事的形勢。我們梁願當局臨此大難，痛下決心，坐而言，繼之以起而行，故在第一屆陸軍節，提出　建陸軍的口號，以喚起全國上下的注意，共同督促軍事行政的改革，一新我陸軍的面目！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕在太平洋中盤旋已達三日之強大　風，自五日越過台灣後，昨突以侮小時十四哩至廿四哩之速度，直趨西北，其中心於晚八時卅五分掠過離上海若干里之東部，轉向東北日本海方面吹去。本市因竟日在風　範圍內，自上午九時起迄下午十時止，始終爲狂麾驟雨所籠罩。氣象台上高懸紅燈四只，表示八級颱風之中心正滯留上海附近，故浦江所有航輪，全部停泊未開，濁浪翻騰中，無數駁船貨輪俱吿似覆，損失尙無法統計，機塲方面，除上午八時有自東京飛來之西北公司航機一架安全降落外，九時後風勢轉勁，其餘各班客機全部停飛。美軍駐留本市之航機，亦早於淸晨全部奉命飛赴南京，暫避風威。市區內部，則因廿四小時中降雨達一。三一吋，加以風勢强勁，江水倒灌，積潦無法宣洩，較低窪之南京路永安公司前，蒲石路華懋公寓前，林森中路英士路等各處，俱成澤國，汪洋一片，水深處竟達膝部以上。其中尤以林森中路自黄陂南路起，至思南路止，因路軌爲積水淹沒，下午五時後法商各路有軌電車俱吿停駛，幽靜之林森中路上，入晚間無人跡，附近各戲院舞廳，門庭冷落，情景尤見沉寂。當風勢於昨午十一時左右最凶惡時，宛如排山例海萬馬奔騰，本市各區房屋，籬笆，街道樹，廣吿路牌吹倒者不可勝數，震撼所及，長途電話亦吿失靈，水電設備損毁重大，各商店因避免損失，俱臨時停業，汽車拋錨於路中者更比比皆是，三輪車及人力車營業大好。所幸迄昨晚十時以後，颱風業已離境，雖仍有間歇之風雨，但已不足爲患矣。據氣象台預測，今日下午天氣即可轉好，並將開始放晴。</p>
<p>按此次颱風在抵達台灣後，其方向本係直趨閩廈一帶，嗣因西南熱帶氣洗東迫，太平洋氣團之高氣壓又滯留琉球附近，颱風乃改道北向，正午達北緯廿八度東經一百廿二度，此後即在風速卅哩內向北偏西進行。在颱風經過沿海之全部行程中，各地氣候均受劇烈影饗，南京有大風雨，福州風勢達十二級，而台灣亦竟日在六十至七十哩之强烈風速中渡過。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日航輪失事情況，略誌於後：十一號十二號浮筒之福裕輪，正擬裝貨駛往廣州，船邊停泊駁船十餘艘，因該輪前後纜均吿折斷，船身被風吹至浦西岸邊擱淺，因之大多數駁船遭受碰撞，相繼傾覆者達七八艘，損失不可勝數，傷亡尙待調査。又泊於三十二號三十三號之美登陸艇1×103號及1×187號兩艘，亦被吹至西岸擱淺。泊於三十三號三十四號之繼光輪，一度纜繩折斷，立予急救，幸米發生事故。又泊於三十六號三十七號之油輪魯克斯船主號，及泊於三十八號及三十九號浮简之1×173號登陸艇，均被風吹向西岸擱淺。</p>
<p>又衆航公司航利蝓，昨晨自任港載客三百餘返滬。至寳山角獅子林江面，遭遇颱風機擊，大有不支之勢，急電來滬，鯖求施救，奈因風勢狂烈，無法出口營救，迄至傍晚，航利輪尙無進口消息。至昨日出口船變，大部均吿停頓，江亞·江輪兩輪中止對開，美輪格閘脫昨晨出口，至三夾水拋錨避風。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕京滬·滬杭兩路，沿該行車號誌頗多損壞，電話綫亦被吹折，臨時改用「電報行車制」，站與站之間雖一順方向，亦祗準一列車行駛，以免發生意外。且機車受强大風力所阻，行車速率大减，各次列車均無法準點到站，京滬綫五次·七十七次·七次·十五次·七十九次·七十一次·五十三次，三次及滬杭綫六十四次·二十六次·二十二次·六十二次等列車，分別誤點卅分，一小時，一小時半或二小時不等。</p>

<p>據悉，此次各公共交通機構對調整票價，要求之增漲率，均在百分之三百以上，公用局於審核時，趙曾珏局長曾極力抑低，假定無票乘車能有效取締制止，乃核减至百分之一百五十左右。惟當時各公司均一致請求當局迅即成立軍警憲統一之紏察機構，加緊肅淸無票乘客，否則必至無法維持。同時並希望一般乘客，亦能協助公司隨時隨地檢舉，俾公司得以維持，而免再增加一般乘客本身之負担云。</p>

<h3 id="c90">慶祝首屆陸軍節　展開全面勘亂建國新頁 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日訊〕今天是「七七」抗　十一週年紀念日，同時是首届陸軍節，陸軍總司令部余總司令漢謀特撰「吿全國陸軍官兵同志書」一篇，言簡意賅，茲節要如次：</p>
<p>在戡亂軍事進入高度緊張的現階段中，我們來紀念並慶祝這一傽大節日，是具有重大而深切的意義的，因爲過去我們革命建國的障礙是外來的侵略勢力—日寇，我們已經在元首領導之下以八年的抗戰來學敗它，現在我們革命建國的障礙，是內在的反動勢力—共匪，我們更得要在元首領導之下以較長時期的戡亂來蕩平它。「七七」揭開了抗戰的序幕，奠定了「抗戰必勝」的基礎，這首届陸軍節，也就是「七七」更展開了全面戡亂的新頁，顯示着「戡亂必定，建國必成」的象徵。古人說：「行百里者半九十，」爲了達成革命建國的歷史任務，我們當然要付出重大的代價，經過目前的艱苦行程，百折不回，再接再厲，向着這個總目標勇往邁進。在這偉大的節日裏，我們回想過去光榮的戰績，面對當前嚴重的危機，覺得我們陸軍所負任務，尤爲艱鉅，而戡亂建國的大業，更賴舉國一致之努力，才能順利達成茲特就下面幾點，加以闡述，以敬吿我全全體陸軍官兵同志：</p>
<p>（一）克盡軍人天職，保持陸軍光榮—軍人的天職在「捍衛國家，保護人民，」這是古今中外所公認的。從前革命軍北伐，曾拿「不貪財，不怕死，愛國家，愛百姓，」的口號，去打倒軍閥，完成國家統一，解除人民疾苦，所以人民　食　桀，以迎國軍，爾一後八年浴血抗戰，我們軍人爲了維護國家主權，保障民族生存，更寫下了許多光榮的史蹟，奠定了最後勝利基礎，爭得「四强」之一的祟高國際地位，可是　着勝利的到臨，萬惡共匪就發動了武裝的全面叛亂，使我們的國際地位，一落千丈，國家民族遭逢歷史上空前的危難，我們革命軍人負有「衛國保民的重責，眼看着菲苻滿地，哀鴻遍野，那得不痌　在抱，重振旗鼓，痛下不滅共匪誓不生還的決心，來戡平叛亂，安定民生，解救國家民族的危機，以盡到軍人的天職，保持陸軍的光榮。</p>
<p>（二）發揚軍人武德，第養軍人氣節元元首曾昭示我們：「中國自古以來，眞正的一車人必講武德，所謂武德，就是「智，信，仁，勇，嚴」。武德就是軍人必具的精神，也就是我們軍人的靈魂，如果軍人不講武德，沒有軍人的精神，失去了軍人的靈魂，就不成其爲軍人，尤其不成爲革命軍人」。可見我們要運川戰術，先要修養武德，有了高尙的武德，才能獲致最大的勝利。所謂「智」，除了軍事上應具備的知能外，更要「別是非，明利害，識時勢，知彼己」。所謂「信，就是「三信心」，對自己有自信，對部下能信任，對長官有信仰。所謂「仁」，就是仁愛，也就是博愛，要能愛國家，愛百姓，愛部屬，愛同胞。所謂「勇」，就是不怕，要能冒險犯難，忍苦耐勞，貧賤不移，威武不屈。所謂「嚴」，就是嚴明，要能嚴以律已，嚴以待人，嚴以處事，尤其要嚴明赏罰。五者之中，「仁」爲武德的中心，「嚴」爲武德之首要，更要以「誠」來施「智」，以誠來昭「信」，以誠來行「仁」，以誠來使「勇」，以誠來示「嚴」。元首又曾昭示我們：「革命軍人最要講氣節，要講氣節，先要重禮義，知廉恥，重禮義，則知尙氣節，尙氣節，則能團結精神，上下一致，知廉恥，則能明生死，明生死，則遭遇任何犧牲而無所惜」。因此，我們革命軍人必須遵照元首的訓示，發揚武德培養氣節，受傷不退，被俘不屈，轉　不潰，被圍不驚，本必勝之信念，抱必死之決心，才能表率軍民　，克敵制勝。</p>
<p>（二）完成剿匪任務，實現建軍計劃—剿匪不是內亂，而是剿平叛亂，戡亂不是破壞和平，需是學取水久的統一與和平。我們軍人爲遭到本身的天職，自然要上下一心，軍民合作，陸海空軍協同，以全力來剿滅它。可是共匪是有組織，有策略的，並且正在運用其策略，到處煽惑民衆，欺騙民衆，裏脅民衆，進行所謂「參軍」，「土改」，「搶糧」等運動，藉以充裕其兵源和餉源。因此單靠軍事的力量還不够應付當前的局勢，我們必須本「軍事，政治，經濟一元化」的原則，實施「總體戰」，以粉碎共匪一切在軍事，政治，經濟上的陰謀與措施此外，尤須澈底暸解匪情，坦白檢討本身加强訓練，力求改進，處處爭取主動，這樣才能完成剿匪任務。再則，由於原子時代的到處，人類已臨到「滅亡「生存的分水綫上，第二次世界大戰表面上雖吿結束，可是國際間的猜忌並未完全泯除，戰爭的種子仍在暗中散播，爲「未雨綢繆」計，我們應當積極充實國防，以防萬一。現在戰爭雖趨「立體化」，可是作爲國防基幹的陸軍，仍不失其最重要的地位，「建國必先建軍」，我們的建軍計劉，雖遭受共匪的阻擾，不能即時實現，但是在不影響剿匪軍事條件之下，仍當逐步使　實現，以强化我們的國防，保障國家民族的生存獨立，爭取國家民族的自由平等。</p>

<h3 id="c96">蘆溝橋的火花 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>十一年前的今天，在號稱「燕台十景」之一的「蘆溝曉月」所在地，由於日寇的尋釁，演出了八年抗戰的序幕。今天正値紀念日，來重溫一下那時的噩夢。</p>
<p>民國廿六年六月中旬，北平豐台兩地的日本駐軍，在北平近郊作野戰演習，繼續旬餘，槍砲之聲不　。到了七月七日，演習進至宛平城郊之蘆溝橋畔。入晚，請有日兵四名失踪，要求至宛平縣城內搜索，未獲許可。日軍聲勢洶洶，幾欲强行入城，但因駐軍戒備森嚴，未敢輕侮。雙方相持至午夜，日軍忽以大砲向宛平城及蘆溝橋猛轟，繼以步兵攻擊。我駐軍以守土有員，爲自衛計，亦下令還擊。蘆溝橋事變因此發生。</p>
<p>當時駐防宛平的軍隊，是三十七師吉星文團的第三營。吉星文則駐長辛店，聞訊後，即於兩小時內馳赴宛平，親自指揮戰事。八日上午，戰況至爲劇烈。敵大隊長一木淸直少校陣亡，聯隊副森田亦於九日晚受傷，該隊士軍死傷殆盡。此後，敵又自通州調來河邊旅團，鈴木師團，由東北調來波田戰車團，得川男爵之隨行兵團，靖宮隆昌兵團，土肥原兵團及第六，第二十兩師團，前後已有十餘萬人，以華北駐屯軍司令田代爲指揮官。田代於十七日夜死於豐台隊，改由香月司令繼任。</p>
<p>敵軍雖一再增援，我軍始終沈着應戰。八寳山，衙門口屢次戰關，擊斃敵軍無數。旋吉星文部　至長辛店，而代以保安第三旅戴守義部，後又將駐保定之陳春榮部，調至長辛店，作第二綫　部署，相持凡二十餘日，宛平城及蘆溝橋始終未失。至二十九日，兩地防務，始交友軍接替。</p>
<p>在蘆溝橋戰況纖持之下，敵軍見目的未達，於是轉移祖綫，向駐廊坊黄材之劉振三旅攻擊，並以飛機轟炸，因猝不及防，故損失頗重。我軍見日寇無理至此，乃急調駐河間一三二師趙登禹部，兼程移至南苑，衛戍平郊。時敵已自天津調來大批援軍，結集豐台。趙登禹部　到不久，部署未定，即遭敵寇襲擊，激戰竟日，士兵傷亡甚衆，然士氣仍極盛，誠可歌可泣之一幕也。</p>
<p>黄溝橋事變之發生，日寇原欲襲兀一八之故按，兵不血刃而奪取北平。當在事變一星期前，宋哲元已感到和日本之週旋的困難。迨事變發生後，日本尙欲表示事出誤會，願自蘆溝橋撤退，但須派火車一列，運兵回至北平。各方面聞此，極力反對，但我方爲息事髯人計，終派汽車運日軍回城。當日軍進城時，汽車行列，擁滿兵士，但不知確數多少耳。</p>
<p>其時日寇在華北，氣焰萬丈，當局遵「和平未到絕望，決不放棄和平，犧牲未到最後關頭，決不輕言犧牲」之原則，始終希望作爲地方事件來解決。但敵寇不予談判之誠意，無非延長增兵之時間，一再節外生枝，敷衍時日，一面却源源加調部隊人關，尋釁肇事，和平顯然已是成爲不可能的願望了。七月十七日，蔣委員長在廬山發表談話，揭示嚴正的立塲，說：「（一）任何解決不得侵書中國主權與領土的完整，（二）冀察行政組識，不容任何不合法之改變。（三）中央政府所派地方官吏，如冀察政務委員會委員長宋哲元等，不能任人要求撤換，（四）第廿九路軍現在所駐地域，不留受任何約束。」最後，沉痛宣示：「我們希望和平而不求苟安，準備應職而決不求戰。我們知道全國抗戰以後的局勢，就祗有犧牲到底，無絲毫僥倖求免之理。如果戰端一開，那就是地無分南北，年無分老幼，無論何人皆有守土抗戰之責任，皆應抱定犧牲一切之決心。」這篇嚴正宣言·明示中國爭取和平之最大限度與爭取生存之最後決心。</p>
<p>此一證明發表後，日寇知此事已不可能循九一八之路綫，以求解決，於是更暴露其猙獰面目與侵略野心，一再向我軍侵凌。最後，宋哲元氏對日軍所提出的一紙無理的通牒，加以斷然的拒絕，次日即奉令進行堅强的抵抗。至此，交涉二十餘日之蘆溝橋事件，顯已超越地方事件之範圍，而中日間之戰爭，遂田局部而向全面擴展了。</p>

<h3 id="c97">市長徇糧業請求提高限價　食糧市場昨起開做 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>白米價每担不得超過二千萬元</p>
<p>本市南北兩米市塲，及粉麩油餅雜糧等五大市塲，管理委員及代表邢志剛·邱福祥·張超·楊鼎臣·周萬超·單文俊·胡文安·查寶三等，昨晨八時，聯合向市府請願，要求提高限價，俾使市塲交易能納入正軌。吳市長即電請社會局長吳開先會間商討，經決定原則，食米價格不超過二千萬元，食油方面，荳油不超過四千五百萬元，菜油四千二百至三百萬元，油由植物油廠負責供應。雜糧方面，黄豆不超出一千萬元，小麥七千五百萬元，麵粉方面兵船粉五千四百萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：吳市長爲明暸食油供應情形，曾於昨日下午四時，在市府召見植物油榨煉業公會代表邱良榮·李廷棟·謝裕祥等，垂詢一切。各油商代表，當以於三日由中植油廠，聯合其他民營各大油廠，在市塲以三六五〇萬元，拋售菜油三千五百餘担之實際情形報告市長，旋由市長對今後食油供應價格標準等問題，詳加指示。</p>
<p>據悉：昨晨汕市業已做開，廠豆油一律四五〇〇萬元，生菜油四三〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：食米昨起提高限價爲二千萬元，市上交易已有少數做開，惟高貨米仍絕跡，僅中次粳薄稻及早稻按限價成交，碾秈及蕪秈等供應較多，因無錫等產地價昂，按此限價，尚不敷高貨米之成本。上白粳及薄稻之場外價格。均喊二千二百萬，高羊秈亦喊此價。昨日到貨南北二市共到一七七九萬石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>尚未正式交易，昨因價格未決定，須待當局與廠方商討後決定，交易未能展開，麩皮上午亦不開出，據一般之預料，今日可恢復交易，小麥爲八百五十萬。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>昨恢復自由買賣，惟仍以不任意抬高爲原則，交易已漸見做開，但尚不十分活躍。乍豆以九百萬成交，較限價挺五十萬元。紅糧未開，苞米高貨一千一百萬，蠶豆做開甚多，價格平定。芝蔴尚穩，漢口白蔴二千四百萬元，生仁挺百萬元，大汶口生仁三千六百萬。</p>
<p>食油</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦通訊〕本月廿九日，由希臘南部奧林匹克村傳來的奧林匹克火炬，即將由最後一名接力跑手，傳到溫布烈運動會塲，而燃起奧林匹克火燄。英王喬治六世，即將正式爲第十四屆爲期十四日的世界運動大會開幕。</p>
<p>爲了招待參加世運的六十國選手，英國已將倫敦西南部戰時的軍用療養營，改成爲選手們的招待所。這個招待所，位置在佔地二千二百五十英畝的里却　御苑裏，過去該苑曾一度爲查理第一世獵鹿的所在，後來自里却蒙公爵亨利，於一四八五年成爲英王之後，又繼續與英國歷代皇帝保持着相當關係。</p>
<p>除了里却　公園之外，還有許多其他軍營也都改成了選手的招待所，同時倫敦又有六十個運動塲，也撥與奧林匹克選手作爲練習之用。大會期間，除了各國選手在溫布萊大會塲一萬觀衆的注視之下，比賽高低之外，在英國西南岸又將舉行汽艇比賽，而倫敦以及倫敦附近，又將舉行自行車與摔角比賽。</p>
<p>雖然從名義來說，這是第十四屆世運大會，事實上由於戰事的阻隔，這只是第十一屆大會。這一點同古希臘的作風正相反，那時候奧林匹克大會不能因戰爭而停止舉行，倒是要等到運動大會結束，冠軍選出，諸神受過崇敬之後，才能繼續戰爭哩。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕惠勃爾登男子雙打賽中，法根堡上屆和克拉茂合作無堅不摧，取得了冠軍，本屆和單打第一種子派克搭配，奪標呼聲最高，所以入選爲第一種子組，第二種子是湯勃朗和墨洛埃。勃朗維區雖然是雙打聖手，但是因爲薛格曼球藝並無特長，所以退居第三，排在派法一部內，一般預測，以爲澳洲組這次連決賽週也踏不進。豈料派克已非當年雄姿，半決賽中，美澳會議時，派法以全力相搏，雖然曾有過二對一領前一盤的優勢，但是歲月　情，勃薛組扳成平手後，派兒已到了氣窮力盡的地步，僅由廿二歲的法根堡獨支大厦。勃薛於是　其餘勇，以六比一輕易取得末盤，奪獲決賽權。</p>
<p>瑞典的貝傑林是今年惠勃爾登的一匹黑馬，在單打賽中氣走了第一名好漢派克，雙打與哈伯合作，複賽週中，又以直落三淘汰了南菲國手史德基斯與英國台盃代表　脫命的第四種子組。半決賽雖然以二比三敗於湯勃朗與　洛埃，但是選會兩度佔先，並且最後一盤又是二度「杜斯」後，方以六比八失敗。</p>
<p>決賽又是美澳爭雄的局面，美國雖以七比五力取首盤，但是湯勃朗的突然失態，使　洛埃枉有　極佳妙的演出，仍然無濟於事。墨洛埃在單打中，假如有這樣的表演，絕不致以〇比三被法根堡擊敗。勃朗維區和游格曼就在墨洛埃單拍難敵二手的情勢下，以七比五，七比五，九比七力取三盤，榮膺雙打　標，聊償單打辱於美人拍下之恨。</p>
<p>女子雙打是今年惠勃爾登五項錦標賽冷門最少的一項。種子組都幾乎未受到若何抗拒而順利普級，我國僑英好手何愛英與英國奧絲朋合作，力破三關，到最後八組，才以一比二被第四種十英國的鮑斯托克夫人和勃莉亞擊敗。何愛英自膺草地網球冠軍後，球藝更見進步，惠勃爾登單打中，不幸於第二週中被杜邦夫人淘汰，但是何小姐身手，已爲圈內外人所共賞。雙打之未能更進一籌，搭配軟弱，是致命主因，假如和何小姐合作的是美國而不是英國的奧絲朋，未必便無染指錦標，爲我國體育史添上燦爛的一頁的希望呢。</p>
<p>爭雙打后銜的是白露與杜邦，赫德與杜特，也是包辦女子單打半決賽的美國四傑，威脫門盃長勝的選手。兩對都是從初賽起便沒有失過一盤，經廿七局鏖戰後，白露與杜邦終以藝高一等，以二比一力取赫德與杜特，一　七屆決賽被辱之仇。</p>
<p>混合雙打冠軍爲白露與勃郎維區組蟬聯。白·勃二人，俱特擅於雙打，半決賽以五比七，六比一，八比六力克特洛勃尼杜與特夫人組，決賽則以六比二，三比六，六比三擊敗另一美澳混合組薛格曼與赫德。薛·赫於半決賽時以二比一淘汰第二種子湯勃朗與杜邦夫人，造成混合雙打中之惟一冷門。</p>
<p>戰後第一屆惠勃爾登，白露即與奧絲朋及湯勃朗合作，通得女雙及混合兩錦標，惟單打決賽被　芝壓倒，功虧一簣。今年杜邦夫人婚後退化，白露遂得以席捲三項錦標，稱　網壇，與馬迪夫人及馬白兒小姐（昨日本文最後一句，蓓芝係馬白兒之誤）後先媲美。</p>
<p>勃朗維區今年亦得兩雙打錦標，惜單打決賽，見敗於法根堡，未竟全功，否則霸王網后，亦不讓一九三九年勃琪與馬迪夫人專美於前矣。（下）。（鄒定鑫）</p>

<h3 id="c124">平物價先平人心 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>物價問題雖然衆口一詞認爲嚴重異常，但對於許多人，恰如北平某報所說的：「漲吧，待死的人早已不怕死了！」已經失掉了刺激作用。因爲凡是詞典上可以引用的一切刺激字眼，在物價問題上早被應用無遺，如「狂漲」，「激漲」，「飛漲」，「扶搖直上」，「滿堂紅」，「三級跳」之類，十年來的報紙上幾乎無日無之，人人心理上也早已視若理所當然。從前聽人　起德國的馬克，不免認爲不可思議，現在則對於億萬的數字，大家早已「不擺在心上」了。</p>
<p>而且，不怕死的，尚不僅限於早處絕望地位的大多數「待死的人」；「待死的人」所以不怕死，倒也並不是因爲眞的視死如歸，祗是大勢所趨，非做犧牲者不可罷了，因此在心理上早已養成了「待死」的準備，雖然一面仍在生與死的邊緣掙扎，不過對於一切足以促成速死的條件，已不感刺激，也無所怕懼了。</p>
<p>然而，另有一部份不怕死的人，其立塲却完全與上面所說的「待死者」不同。「待死者」的所以不怕死，祗是弱者與犧牲者的一種絕望的處境使然，此輩人中比較性格强硬一些的，就落入挺而走險的一流，輭弱一些的，則就是歸於自殺的一類，其餘的則不妨統統歸入「待死者」類；然而他們都不外是大環境下的弱者與犧牲者罷了。</p>
<p>而另一部份不怕死的人，並非眞的不怕死，却是有恃無恐。這輩人的生活哲學就是「天大的官司，地大的銀子。」他們對於一切警告或威嚇性之言論，恰像「待死者」對於漲漲漲一類的字眼一樣，也早已不感刺激。憑他們過去十年來的經騐，早知道你拿得出來的辦法，不過是如此這般一回事而已。而且你的所謂辦法愈多，造成他們從中取利的機會也愈多，你說要給他們「顏色看」，他們給　一個「漲停板」的答　；你警告他們「要錢不要命，要命不要錢」，他們回你一個「滿堂紅」！</p>
<p>這並不是我個人的偏激之詞，而都是擺在眼前的事實。然而這一切你又能怪誰？怪投機者嗎？如果你我都有投機的機會，恐怕誰也不甘落後吧。試看娘姨大姐之流都在做「套利」或囤箱把肥皂之類！你說怪政府嗎？政府制裁投機囤積的法令多如牛毛。如果有人能將抗戰迄今所公布施行的一切經濟法令編　成册，則敢說世界各國在非常時期所曾實行過的經濟措施都已包羅在內了。而別人行之有效的，在我們這裏却無一不成具文。</p>
<p>一部份道義論者認爲一切好的辦法在我們都不能獲得好的結果，是因爲我們的民族道德正在走着下坡道，是人民對於社會與國家缺乏道義的責任感所致。這自然不能不承認是一部份理由。不過，道義這種東西原也不是憑空所能發生的；道義的基礎就是人對是非觀念的判斷。如果社會不分是非，施政祗顧少數人的利益，而猶要求多數人對國家社會負起通義的責任，就不能不說是苛求。立法委員中曾有人說我們這邊是在用着窮人的錢與生命爲富人打仗，話雖不免說得過火了一些，但游資蜂　南來和富人們往大都市集中等事實，則究竟也是不容否認的。</p>
<p>其實，即使是爲富人打仗，也不能說是一件說不出口的事，因爲，保護私人財富，在正常的資本主義國家中，同時也就是等於保護社會財富，唯一的條件是祗要這些私人財富在國家有事之秋確能爲國所用。英美是當世的典型資本主義國家，在兩次世界大戰中，他們的富人雖也獲利無算，但畢竟也會自行化過本錢的。丙爲他們雖然也有窮人，然而完全呌窮人去賣命，在他們那裏是辦不到的事。戰後，英美國民生活水準的相對普遍提高，就是一個有力的證據。（尤其是英國，戰後重要企萊的國營化與平民勢力的抬頭，更足證明他們的戰爭確是一種國民戰爭。）</p>
<p>而在我國則雖然在抗戰初期也曾有過一個有錢出錢，有力出力的舉國一致效命的時期，可是時至今日，早已不然。有錢者不僅一毛不拔，而且是食慾無窮。救濟特捐之迄今無交代，以及物價漲風之再接再厲，已將此　有錢人的嘴臉刻劃無遺。反之，當初尚是有力出力的，而今則即使是無力還非出力下去不可。各地的黴兵微糧以至苛　攤派，那一份不是落在這輩可憐蟲的身上！</p>
<p>社會現象如此，我們還能空口談甚麼是非，講甚麼道義？「待死者」旣已不怕死，而徼倖者也不長死，兩者所處的立塲雖異，其表現整個社會已走至山窮水盡的絕望境地則一。如果國家的施策不能針對這稱情勢速作根本革新之圖，則一切枝枝節節的經濟政策與物價政策，除了供給投機份子作爲做空做多的本錢外，恐怕永遠不會有什麼效果。當前的物價問題，已不復是單純的經濟問題，而是一個人心問題。故有效的物價對策，應　眼於使人民心平氣服。套句老調，也就是應着眼於「不患寡而患不均一。</p>
<h3 id="c125">別開生面的學校 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 調鸚</p>
<p>「學到老，學不了。」</p>
<p>這句話在今天格外見得眞確，因爲學校旣名目繁多，學科更五花八門，美不勝收。譬如，在美國的洛山磯一地而論，就幾乎隨便你想學什麼怪東西，都有專門的學校可進。</p>
<p>有一所學校專門教人怎樣吹口哨。該校的負責人是一位姓史篤克惠爾的女子，她教授吹口哨已有二十餘年的經驗。她的學生中多數是同時在學習唱歌的人，但有時交通警察和童子軍教練員也欣然前來上課；此外，也有不少專門來學習呼狗的人。</p>
<p>還有一所學校專門教人怎樣混合鷄尾酒，先後畢業的學生已有五千人之多。他們的學程規定四星期畢業，但有些天分高的學生祗需十天，有的却學了八個星期還不會，結果祗好憤然退學。那所學校的教案裏有一只長達五十英尺的酒吧，學生們以染了不同顏色的水作爲鑲配鷄尾酒的各種酒，大家立在酒吧後而小心地把顏色水倒來倒去，兩位導師熱心地在旁指導。</p>
<p>洛山磯還有一個「星相學校」，專門教學生們占卜休咎和推算命運這一套高深無比的「學問」，學生視秉賦的不同，須難業二年至十年不等。畢業時也有文憑可得，但學校裏究竟在教些什麼東西呢？外而人却大家不知道。</p>
<p>「星相學校」的電話倒很忙。買跑馬票的賭客往往打電話來問那一匹馬可以跑第一，將要做父母的靑年夫婦也常常急切地來問倒底他們將有一個兒子還是一個女兒。</p>
<p>如果你記不牢親友的電話號碼，你就該申請自費出洋到洛山磯去進一只一記性學校。據說美國政界商界中人，進該校者很多；還有記不住台詞的演員，弄不淸骨科術語的　料學生，也有到該校去受特種訓練的。</p>
<p>此外，還有兩位目光遠大的女教育家在洛山磯開辦了一只家政專門學校，專門教授少女們怎樣做一個賢良的主婦，辦得成績極好，入學者極爲踴躍，由其是將要結婚的少女。最近，有一個焦急得近乎瘋狂的少女，理到了家政學校，含着眼淚說，她和她的男朋友談天時，她不知怎麼忽然吹起牛來，說自己會燒一手好菜，那位男朋友喜出望外，就告訴她一定到她家裏來吃夜飯——但是她實在從來沒有燒過小菜，怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>家政學校裏的仁慈的導師們對她極表同情，她們就爲她特設了一次「超速成班」，使她在兩小時內學會了燒三樣極可口的小菜。</p>

<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>做人，縱然不能做成一個「磁性的人物」，處處討人歡喜，至少不可做成一個「不識相的傢伙」，常常惹人生厭。</p>
<p>我還不楚一個「磁性的人物」，說不上討人歡喜，但我很想「識相」一點，不要惹人生厭。</p>
<p>我覺得有兩件事是最「討人厭」的：一是借債，一是謀職。</p>
<p>借債是怎麼一回事？就是把別人家的錢，拿來給你用一下。但是，你要用錢，別人也是要用錢的，別人爲什麼要拿他的錢給你用呢？退一步說，縱然別人錢多，自己不用，但是借給你，總是一件囉囌事，又要提防着你還不出，又怕强盜因而知道自己是個富人。再說，現在物價天天漲，時時漲，借給你時是一百萬，收回來時（假定時間只隔一天）也許只抵得五十萬了，蝕本的生意，誰高興？我很明白這個道理，所以下定決心，非到萬不得已時不向人借債，在一萬次的情形下，九千九百九十九次不借　。</p>
<p>求人謀職，也是一件令人大傷腦筋的事。現在各機關皆在緊縮裁人，那里還有「職」？幸而有了一個「缺」，但你也求，他也求，給誰是好呢？你說你是廳長介紹，而別人倒也是部里的秘書介紹的；你說你服務熱心，而別人過去也曾表現好成績；你說你學問好，別人也是什麼考試及格了的呀：半斤，八兩，小數點六七磅，大家都差不多，粥少僧衆，給誰是好？又怕得罪你，又怕見怪他，又怕結怨什麼「來頭大」，這種事還不討人　嗎？我雖然明知這個道理，但我却無法「識相」，不向人家「求」因我現已畢業了，不得不麻煩人家。</p>
<p>在目前這種社會環境中，即使要想做一個不討厭的人，也不是一件容易的事。做人，難矣哉！</p>
<h3 id="c128">盧溝橋漫談 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>「七七」紀念的不祥日子又來臨了，與一七七」有最密切關係的地名，是「盧溝橋」。爲了日閥在廿六年的七月七日在宛平城南邊盧溝橋侵略唬砲一響，盧溝橋三字也跟火藥味傳播世界了</p>
<p>盧溝橋的得名，是因爲橋是建築在盧溝河上，河水渾濁，故又名渾河。周輝北轅錄說它：「盧溝河，亦謂之黑水河，色最濁，其急如箭。」由此看來，所謂　盧溝」者，是指它的水色，絕非與盧获有關盧」字，根本沒有草頭。橋的東邊碑坊刻着「盧溝曉月」四個大字，也是沒有草頭的。可是十多年來，一般的公私寫述，多是以訛傳訛的把「盧」字寫作「蘆一字，而習非成是了，這是應該糾正的。</p>
<p>橋的建築，金史河渠誌說，是在大定二十九年。明代正統九年重修一次。橋東西長六百六十尺，有十個拱門，幅廣二十六尺。橋欄石獅共計二百八十一座，各個姿態不同，雕刻很工細，雄偉壯觀。橋的初名廣利橋，馬哥博羅遊記叫它「普利桑乾」（因盧溝河又名桑乾河），歐洲人却叫它爲「馬哥博羅橋」。</p>
<p>鐵路未通的時候，從南方北上到北平的，盧溝橋是必經的要道。鐵路完成後，北寗·平漢·平綏三路的銜接處也就在此。日閥發動大規模的侵略戰事，而在盧溝橋先放下一把火，陰謀野心，可以知道了。</p>
<p>據最近由北方的來人說：一月七日，橋的北端第三橋孔，已給北平生記汽車行載重的貨車所壓塌。因爲修理的工程異常艱鉅，一時還沒有修葺的計劃。可憐曾經强烈地震動過每一個中國人的心玆的歷史上有名的建築物，竟已殘缺，與國家的領土同樣地破碎了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Legislative Yuan Passes a Temporary Motion: Consulting the Executive Yuan to Review Commodity Prices; Organizing a Procedural Committee to Expedite the Handling of Important Bills; Public Servants' Cost of Living Index to Be Calculated Monthly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Since the first session of the Legislative Yuan convened, it has been over two months. Apart from a few important bills that have been processed and concluded by the Yuan, the majority of government proposals and several legal cases are currently being reviewed separately by the various committees of the Yuan. Premier Sun Ke reported this matter to the general assembly at the routine Legislative Yuan meeting on the 6th, requesting that each committee nominate one member to form a procedural committee to determine the meeting agenda. With the recess scheduled for the 21st of this month, and only four routine meetings remaining, all important bills should be prioritized for discussion, and the review work of each committee should also be expedited. Furthermore, at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 6th, Zhang Zhijiang and 79 others proposed a temporary motion, advocating that a special committee for reviewing commodity prices should still be established. It also proposed that the Executive Yuan be consulted to take effective measures to ensure that state-owned or publicly-owned enterprises should not arbitrarily fluctuate prices along with commodity price changes. It was resolved to urge the early establishment of the special committee to review the gains and losses of administration since the victory, and to promptly review the issue of commodity prices. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Public Servants' Cost of Living Index Evaluation Committee held its 100th meeting at the Executive Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 6th. Xu Kan, Wang Yunwu, Pang Songzhou, Li Weiguo, Shi Shangkuan, Duanmu Kai, and representatives of the legislative and supervisory yuans, totaling more than ten people, attended the meeting, which was chaired by Xu Kan. The meeting discussed the method of evaluating the cost of living index for public servants. Xu Kan began by reporting, explaining the process of compiling the cost of living index for public servants in the past and the reasons why the cost of living index for public servants was far below the commodity price index. He stated that it was not due to unfair compilation, but because public servants' salaries were calculated based on the cost of living index of the previous month. Subsequently, attendees extensively exchanged opinions on the cost of living index for public servants. The majority advocated that public servants' salaries should be calculated based on the cost of living index of the current month, and that this should be implemented from July. As for the compilation method of the cost of living index, it was still advocated to adopt the past method, that is, to use the average of the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month as the standard, and still be compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS). The July index will be evaluated in the second evaluation meeting after the DGBAS compiles it. The results of the exchange of opinions at the evaluation meeting on the 6th will be made into a proposal by the DGBAS and submitted to the political affairs meeting on the 7th for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] In the past, the remuneration of public servants was calculated based on the cost of living index of the previous month. In the future, it will be changed to be calculated based on the cost of living index of the current month, and will be implemented from July. This will be submitted to the political affairs meeting on the 7th for discussion. If there are no special difficulties, it can be passed and implemented.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The remuneration of military personnel for June has been promulgated by the General Order No. 151 of the Ministry of National Defense, which is 420,000 yuan for the inland areas and 1,100,000 yuan for the Nine Northeastern Provinces. The Financial Department of the United Service Organization (USO) had already remitted new salaries to the supply agencies for the officers and soldiers of each unit based on the May remuneration, which was 310,000 times for the inland areas and 800,000 times for the Nine Northeastern Provinces. The balance of 110,000 times for the inland areas and 300,000 times for the Nine Northeastern Provinces was remitted to the supply agencies on June 25th, and each unit can claim it. In addition, the Finance Department originally provided funding for the military agencies and schools of all units across the country in July based on the May figures, which were transferred to the supply agencies on June 15th and 19th in two installments. Now, based on the amount approved for June, another 110,000 times for the inland areas and 300,000 times for the Nine Northeastern Provinces are being remitted to the supply agencies on June 30th. After the new allowance for July is approved, another allocation will be made.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The 17th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 6th, with Premier Sun Ke presiding. The meeting began at 9:30 AM, starting with reporting matters. Due to the incomplete minutes of the previous meeting, committee members spoke up one after another, and the discussion lasted for an hour. Premier Sun Ke instructed the personnel to pay close attention to avoid any more mistakes. As for the bill on formulating a law on compensation for wrongful convictions, which was transferred from the former Legislative Yuan and issued by the former National Government for handling, it was resolved to consult the Executive Yuan to draft the legal provisions and submit it to the Yuan for review. The other three legal cases transferred from the former Legislative Yuan and submitted by the former National Government and the former Judicial Yuan, as well as a petition from the National Fisheries Corporation Joint Office and the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Association, were all submitted to the relevant committees for review. At this point, the secretariat reported that the Executive Yuan's written replies to the Legislative Yuan's inquiries on policy guidelines had all been completed and submitted. Premier Sun Ke then urged the conveners of each committee to pay attention to work efficiency, quickly complete the review of important bills, and report them to the Yuan for discussion before the recess. Discussion matters began at 10:40 AM: (1) Zhou Jieren and others proposed to amend the Organic Law of the Examination Yuan, abolishing the Ministry of Examination and transferring its functions to the direct management of the Examination Yuan to avoid duplication and save public funds. After heated debate, it was put to a vote, and the result was defeated (see separate article for details). The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>The meeting resumed at 3:40 PM in the afternoon. Because Premier Sun Ke was absent on leave, Liu Jianqun was temporarily elected as chairman. With the consent of the attendees, the agenda was changed to discuss the report of the Legislative Committee on the review of the draft Supervisory Law. Du Guangxun, the convener of the Legislative Committee, explained the process of reviewing and amending the draft, and then a general discussion began. However, no one spoke. During the article-by-article discussion, some committee members had divergent opinions on the wording of the articles. Zheng Yanfen suggested that the secretariat personnel read the full text of the draft law so that the committee members could have a comprehensive understanding of the bill. As for the proposed amendments, the committee members were asked to submit them in writing, which would be compiled and submitted to the Legislative Committee for further review. This was passed by the attendees without objection. Then, the discussion matters listed on the original agenda were proceeded with: (2) Huang Jun and others proposed to amend Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Employee Welfare Regulations by adding another clause, collecting 2/1000 of business income and submitting it monthly to the same-level labor union for use in accordance with its constitution to carry out employee welfare undertakings. Another principle was stipulated that the expenses of labor unions for employee welfare undertakings shall not be less than 80% of the upper-level labor union, and the expenses for holding provincial (municipal) or national welfare undertakings shall not be less than 10% to protect labor life and facilitate the development of labor union work. It was resolved to submit it to the Labor Committee and the Social Committee for review. (3) Liu Shidu and others proposed to formulate a law to encourage talented people to take up employment and promote autonomous work, and to consult the government on its implementation.

<h3 id="e7">The Issue of the Existence of the Ministry of Examination Aroused Fierce Debate at the Legislative Yuan Meeting Yesterday; The Proposal to Abolish It Was Defeated in the Vote <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The issue of the existence of the Ministry of Examination of the Examination Yuan caused fierce debate at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 6th. The arguments put forward by Zhou Jieren and others in their "Proposal to Amend the Organic Law of the Examination Yuan, abolishing the Ministry of Examination and transferring its functions to the direct management of the Examination Yuan to avoid duplication and save public funds" believed that examination work is the main duty of the Examination Yuan. If a Ministry of Examination is established, the Examination Committee members will have no way to exercise their powers, and the Examination Yuan itself will become a redundant institution. After the case was submitted for discussion, it was immediately opposed by Chen Guyuan, Zhang Daofan, Zhong Feixiang, etc. Chen pointed out that the Examination Yuan is a decision-making and supervisory body, while the Ministry of Examination is an operational body, so they should be set up separately. Zhang also cited the example of supervisory committee members not being involved in operations, emphasizing that Examination Committee members should not interfere in operations either. Zhong explained that the Examination Yuan's budget is only half of the Supervisory Yuan's, and reducing expenditure should not focus on this to the extent of affecting the examination administration. However, Lu Fu and Du Guangxun supported the case. Lu focused on examination not being a regular business, so it should not be set up as a ministry. Du refuted the statement that supervisory committee members do not interfere in operations, saying that the supervisory committee members' own duties are precisely to investigate, impeach, and censure. Examination Committee members should be responsible for examination according to the constitution, and the examination committee for conducting examinations will be established as needed at any time, so it should not be specially set up as a ministry for handling affairs. The debate between the two sides was extremely fierce. By 12:00 noon, the meeting time had arrived, so it was put to a vote. 106 people opposed the case, and 65 people supported the case. Neither exceeded half of the 293 committee members present. Premier Sun announced that the case was defeated because there were even fewer supporters than opponents, and then adjourned the meeting amid angry roars from several committee members.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 6th] Zhang Boling flew to Beijing from Tianjin by special plane on the morning of the 6th. Zhang Yi came to meet him from Pingcheng on the "Tianxiong". It took off at 9:15 AM. The Tianjin military and political leaders and Zhang Boling's wife all went to the airport to see him off. It is reported that Zhang Boling's wife is scheduled to go to Beijing in the cool autumn.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Zhang Boling, the first president of the Examination Yuan after the implementation of the constitution, came to Beijing from Tianjin by special plane "Tianxiong" on the 6th. He landed at Ming Palace Airport at 12:50 PM. Wu Dingchang, the president's representative, Liang Yingwen, the deputy secretary-general of the Executive Yuan representing President Weng, Jia Zhongde, the vice president of the Examination Yuan, and more than one hundred members of the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan went to the airport to welcome him. After the special plane landed, Vice President Jia first boarded the plane to express his welcome, and then Mr. Zhang stepped down the ladder. Mr. Zhang was wearing a white linen long shirt, a black gauze vest, a straw hat, and holding a small cattail leaf fan and a cane. He looked very good and did not show any signs of travel fatigue. Mr. Zhang then shook hands with the welcomers one by one, and at 1:00 PM, he went east to the reception center of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to rest. Mr. Zhang and former President Dai Chuanxian will discuss the handover matters on the 7th and decide on the date. In addition, Mr. Zhang was invited by the president to a banquet at 8:30 PM on the 6th. At 5:00 PM, reporters specially visited him at his residence. Mr. Zhang said in his frank tone: I have been engaged in education for more than 50 years and have never been in politics in my life. This time, because of the president's request, especially under such a situation, I cannot refuse, so I reluctantly do it. Then, Mr. Zhang said: When he was running Nankai, he used the words "public" and "ability" as the school motto. Public means being selfless in dealing with people and being courageous to take responsibility, and ability means developing each individual's ability and seeking to have them perform. Now I intend to promote this spirit and this ideal to politics, so that civil servants can also receive this kind of training. In the future, the government's employment of people must be coordinated with the examination administration, so that they cannot be employed without passing the examination. As for the organization of the Examination Yuan and the examination system, Mr. Zhang said: We will implement it in accordance with the constitution. How the constitution stipulates is how we will carry out our work. Mr. Zhang finally stated that he would never give up Nankai's education affairs. Once the affairs of the hospital are handled properly, he must still return north to take care of school affairs, and he will seek to take care of both in the future.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Former Premier Zhang Qun and his wife arrived in Beijing on the same plane as Zhang Boling at 12:50 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Mr. Zhang returned here on the same plane as President Zhang Boling.

Mr. Zhang got out wearing a raincoat, and Jiang Jingguo first shook hands with him. Former Counselor of the Executive Yuan Ju Junliang and others also went to welcome him, and then they returned to their residences separately.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Editorial: Rebuilding the Army, Commemorating July 7th <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>——Thoughts on the First Army Day</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the July 7th Incident and the first Army Day. Across the United States, in addition to commemorating the soldiers who died in the War of Resistance and the compatriots who perished, large-scale troop support campaigns are being held. The July 7th Troop Support Group, organized by the Pacification and Troop Support Association, has reportedly departed from Nanjing and is heading to the front lines of North and Northeast China to慰劳the soldiers who are struggling to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, we have encountered the most glorious and greatest anniversary in the history of our national independence movement. The feelings of the past and present are truly overwhelming. It has been eleven years since the Lugouqiao Incident triggered a full-scale war of resistance. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, although we endured hardship and suffering, we believed that the War of Resistance was a sacred war related to the life and death of our nation. We deeply believed that final victory would belong to us. Therefore, every time the anniversary of the July 7th Incident came, we were always very excited and optimistic, and encouraged everyone with a happy mood to wash away blood and sweat, and learn from the victory of the War of Resistance. Every time we passed a July 7th, we felt closer to the gate of victory. After the victory of the protest, we have commemorated July 7th twice, and today is the third time. In these three years, watching the fruits of victory, from the beginning of Huo Ran to being paid to Dongxi, the great national fortune is getting worse year by year. On this day the year before last, we were sorrowful and emotional. On this day last year, we washed our faces with tears and sadness. Today, recalling the difficulties of the past War of Resistance and looking forward to the future of the country, almost everyone has to hold their heads and cry a scene before they can vent the troubles in their hearts!</p>
<p>However, worries and indignation are not a solution. We must rejuvenate our spirits and find a way out. Today we commemorate July 7th, mourn the soldiers who died in the War of Resistance and the compatriots who perished. It is natural to feel a thousand emotions and feel extremely ashamed. But only making negative expressions without knowing that “knowing shame is close to courage” is definitely not a good child of the Chinese nation. Therefore, to commemorate July 7th today, we must revive the spirit of the War of Resistance, eliminate the obstacles on the road to nation-building, and save the current crisis. The military authorities decided to designate July 7th this year as the first Army Day, and its significance lies in this.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the army at Whampoa Military Academy, we have had a revolutionary army to speak of. During the revolutionary Northern Expedition, it established many brilliant achievements. When the War of Resistance broke out, although our army's equipment was far inferior to the enemy's, it was able to defeat the strong enemy relying on the soldiers' lives. It cannot be said that it was a great success for the Chinese army. The eight years of war achievements are the most glorious page in the history of our national independence movement, and it will always be worthy of our remembrance and pride. Some of the soldiers who died in battle have already been washed and fragrant for eternity, and most of the soldiers not only failed to return home after the victory of the War of Resistance, but still have to fight hard to suppress the rebellion on the front lines. We can hardly imagine what kind of life the compatriots in the rear would be living if there were no such loyal and brave soldiers bleeding there! Therefore, we cannot but express our highest respect for the heroes of the War of Resistance who are still fighting hard to suppress the rebellion on the front lines today, and for the wounded Rongjun comrades. The troop support campaigns in various places are launched everywhere, only expressing one in ten thousand of our sincere respect.</p>
<p>We are now reviewing the current situation and inspecting the pacification military affairs of the past three years, but it makes us have to advocate rebuilding the army. The power of the Communist bandits is expanding day by day, changing from guerrilla warfare to positional warfare, and from destroying transportation lines to attacking large strongholds. The Communist bandits' capture of Luoyang in March this year and the recent intrusion into Wenfeng are clear evidence. Looking back at the national army, it seems that it has changed from active to passive, failing to wait for work, and failing to control the situation with stillness. Comparing the two, it cannot prompt the whole country to be extremely concerned about how to reverse the military decline. We believe that the main key lies in two aspects: one is the issue of military strategy, and the other is the issue of military administration.</p>
<p>Regarding the former, we reviewed the pacification military affairs of the past year and cannot but point out that the national army obviously lacks mobility in fighting against the bandits, which has been taken advantage of by the Communist bandits' "mobile warfare." However, if the national army can also adopt the election campaign, it will not be difficult to capture the main force of the bandits and achieve the task of annihilation. The annihilation victory in the Jingwei River Valley in early May and the initial emergence of the Wanxi Militia in mid-May are proofs. At present, the Central Plains War has reversed the decline due to the recovery of the Kai opponent, but the Communist bandits are also concentrating their main forces in an attempt to achieve success. If the national army wants to capture the main force of the Communist bandits, as long as the national army generals do not have the prejudice of preserving their strength in the Henan-East Campaign, grasp the military opportunities under the principle of unified command, and give full play to the mobility of the army, it will not be difficult to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop. Changing the strategy is not a difficult task, and the most important thing is the reform of military administration. The National Military Pacification Conference will open in the capital tomorrow, and the chiefs of various places will attend, and the need for a thorough review of this issue.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of military administration reform, at present, some of the national army troops are loyal, brave, and disciplined, but generally speaking, the discipline is corrupt, the morale is depressed, and the soldiers' food and clothing are miserable, and all have reached the stage where they must be improved. The government is actively training new troops, and it has already taken this into account. Minister He, after returning from abroad, had already expressed his intention to reform the military administration before taking office as the Minister of National Defense, and after taking office, he proposed three specific plans: (1) to improve the soldiers' food, clothing and training to restore morale; (2) to assign all responsibilities to the commanders-in-chief in the battlefield for command and reward and punishment, so as not to concentrate power entirely in the central government, (3) to end the habit of land promotion that does not value talent but values political relations, and to quickly promote outstanding generals. These three measures are well-aimed and are good strategies, but they must be implemented effectively. In fact, the policy guidelines proposed by President Weng also put forward four principles in the military field: (1) continue to strengthen the military force, (2) improve the treatment of soldiers, (3) unite morale, (4) support local armed forces and give full play to the local security forces to assist the national army in suppressing the rebellion. If these four principles can be implemented effectively, it will not be difficult to reverse the current military situation. We Liangyuan authorities will make a painful decision in the face of this great disaster, sit and talk, and then act on it, so we put forward the slogan of rebuilding the army in the first Army Day to arouse the attention of the whole country and jointly urge the reform of military administration and renew the face of our army!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] The Beiping City Council opened its vandalized offices on the 6th, allowing citizens to visit and understand the truth. In the afternoon, a telegram was sent to the entire country, reporting the facts. It stated that the council members have always been extremely concerned about the issue of assisting students from the Northeast who have come to Beiping. After repeated meetings and extensive discussions, it was agreed that the municipal government should borrow and allocate a large amount of relief grain for assistance. The resolution of this general meeting was to request the Ministry of Education and the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression Headquarters to quickly establish a temporary university, temporary middle school, or summer camp, remedial classes, etc., to accommodate and assist them, so as to avoid washing away and losing schooling. All of this shows the comrades' painstaking efforts to protect the Northeast refugee youth, with absolutely no prejudice. It also said: Even if there is dissatisfaction with this emergency relief measure, one should follow reasonable procedures for petitioning, but to carry bricks, stones and pistols to vandalize a public opinion organ and surround private residences is indeed beyond the norm.</p>
<h3 id="e44">### The Pretext for the Student Incident: Original Text of the Beiping City Council Proposal <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Northeast refugee students used the Beiping City Council's 114th Emergency Relief Method Proposal as a pretext, claiming that it was destroying Northeast education, and on the morning of the 5th, they vandalized the City Council. According to the City Council's 114th Emergency Relief Method Proposal, it is a suggestion to the central government, with the original text as follows: 1. The council should telegraph the central government, requesting that the Commander-in-Chief be instructed to provide summer military training for Northeast students who have arrived in Beiping, regardless of whether they are in public or private schools, as long as they have valid student status and identification. During the training period, they should be given the treatment of soldiers in terms of clothing, food, and accommodation, and their backgrounds, identities, and academic qualifications should be carefully examined. Students with verified student status and pure ideology should be temporarily assigned to Northeast temporary universities or various universities and middle schools for temporary study, and should be allowed to return to their hometowns for schooling when the Northeast is stable. Those with unclear identities and deviant ideology should be subject to supervision and training. Those lacking reading ability should enlist in the army and be discharged after completing their term of service. 2. Telegraph the central government to suspend the allocation of funds and student stipends to various national and public schools in the Northeast, and remit all of them to the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression Headquarters, who, together with the provincial and municipal governments, will review and distribute them to subsidize the expenses of Northeast students in Beiping, or remit them to Northeast temporary universities as funds. Northeast schools should be temporarily suspended to avoid sending students into the customs on one hand and recruiting students on the other, in order to obtain funds and stipends fraudulently. 12. When Northeast national and public schools are suspended and funding is suspended, teachers and staff should be required to enter the customs to work in the original student military training class or Northeast temporary university. (Another proposal is to request the Ministry of Education to allocate special funds to assist Northeast students and run summer camps and remedial classes, etc.) When reviewing this case, the City Council believed that (1) Northeast students are coming to Beiping one after another, and no one is responsible for assessment and review. After arriving in Beiping, they are scattered in temples and streets, with complex identities, which affects the security and social order of Beiping. (2) Currently, students in Beiping are only given one catty of mixed grain per day by the municipal government, and clothing is not provided. (3) The number of Northeast students in Beiping has reached more than 8,000, and all funds and stipends from national Northeast schools should be remitted to Beiping for the exclusive use of Northeast students. (4) Northeast teachers and staff should come to Beiping to be responsible for the supervision and education of Northeast students. Based on these reasons, the proposal was passed.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Demanding the Lifting of the Berlin Blockade: Three Powers Protest to the Soviet Union Separately; Contents to Remain Unpublished Pending Response <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our source] London, 6th Broadcast: Bevin summoned the Soviet Ambassador to the UK today and delivered a letter of protest against the Soviet blockade of Berlin to the ambassador. It is reported that the same letter of protest was also submitted to Soviet ambassadors in Washington and Paris. The Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Mr. Ruffin, arrived at the British Foreign Office at 4:00 PM, spoke with Mr. Bevan for only five minutes, and returned to the embassy to immediately forward the letter of protest to Moscow. Although the content of the letter of protest is not yet known, it is said that it is in the tone of the Aide-Mémoire, demanding that the Soviet Union lift the blockade. The letter of protest states that if the blockade is not lifted, a firm decision by the Four Powers on Berlin or Germany is impossible. Also, New York broadcasts that the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, received the American protest letter regarding the Berlin issue today.</p>
<p>[Report from our source] Paris, 6th Broadcast: The French letter of protest regarding the Berlin issue was submitted to Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov at 4:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Report from our source] New York, 6th Broadcast: A spokesman for the U.S. State Department declared that the content of the American letter of protest to the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin issue will not be disclosed until the Soviet Union has fully considered it and responded. The spokesman also stated that until the Soviet Union provides a response, the Soviet Union must bear the responsibility for dividing Germany. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France will simultaneously strengthen the connection of their occupation zones in Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] Authoritative sources claim that the letters of protest from Western countries to the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin blockade will be delivered to the Soviet ambassadors in London, Paris, and Washington on the 6th, with identical content. Over the past ten days, representatives from the three countries have been meeting here non-stop. The difficulty in drafting the protest lies in expressing the following points in clear terms: (1) Western allies are determined to remain in Berlin unless forced out. (2) Western allies have the right to be stationed in Berlin according to the Four Power Agreement, so they are unwilling to abandon their rights or tolerate the Soviet Union's violation of the agreement. (3) The West believes it is unable to support an ultimatum, so it does not intend to make the protest an ultimatum. (4) To prevent a Soviet plot, as the Soviet Union may request a reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the West may declare that it will not attend the Four Power Conference unless the Berlin situation returns to normal, in order to thwart the Soviet Union's scheme. The Berlin situation has now been transferred from the military governors to the foreign ministries in Washington, London, and Paris. According to diplomatic practice, the West does not intend to formally announce the content of the protest letter before it is submitted to the Kremlin. British officials believe that the Soviet Union's main objective is to prompt the four foreign ministers to convene again to discuss the German issue. France is quite supportive of this, and Bevin told the House of Commons that he is also in favor, but only after normal transportation to West Berlin is restored.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 6th] The Soviet blockade of Berlin has lasted for eighteen days. It is reported that the Soviet side intensified the blockade today. Setter, the acting police chief of the Soviet occupation zone, ordered his subordinates to inspect the trucks traveling from that zone to the Western occupation zones and confiscate the grain, scrap iron, building materials, and telephone equipment they were carrying. American military authorities believe the report is highly reliable. This order will establish another barrier in the center of Berlin, dividing the east and west. At the same time, the American aircraft fleet carrying major supplies to Berlin has been delayed in Frankfurt due to adverse flying weather. The weather in the British occupation zone is good, and the British Air Force is still flying between West Germany and Berlin as usual.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] The French Foreign Ministry announced this morning that the British Embassy in France had secretly informed the French government that the British side had obtained documents proving that the East German Socialist Unity Party was plotting in Berlin to create a situation forcing the Western allies to withdraw from Berlin. French officials also stated that the document was consistent with the intelligence obtained by the French Foreign Ministry. [Reuters, Paris, 6th] Le Figaro newspaper revealed that the East German Communist Party, under orders from Moscow, will implement a plan to force the Western allies to withdraw from Berlin, called the "Instructions for the Berlin Working Class to Declare a State of Crisis."</p>
<p>The content includes: (1) Electricity and other major industries will be sabotaged. Comrades should immediately go to the designated locations. Residents without incident in West Berlin should immediately occupy the streets and squares, and special officials directly appointed by the Central Committee will direct the dispatch of special action teams. (2) In the areas under the command of the special action teams, the masses should hold demonstrations supporting the unification of Berlin and the unification of the currency system, and occupy the city government and other designated locations. (3) The above two actions will be protected by East German police comrades. At the same time, some East German police and military police may interfere with the mass demonstrations, resulting in conflicts. (4) Under these circumstances, the Soviet army will take over the task of protecting the safety of all Berlin Germans, and the Soviet army will also protect the safety of other allied occupation forces and order them to withdraw to designated areas. (5) Workers' groups will declare a state of crisis, and the masses will task our special action teams with organizing a temporary administrative organization. (6) This state of crisis must be declared when the rift between the Soviet Union and the Allies becomes increasingly serious. (7) No independent action may be taken without instructions from the Central Committee. (8) This document should be destroyed as soon as it is received by the special official responsible for implementing this plan. The document was signed by the Secretariat of the East German Communist Party.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Düsseldorf, 5th] The main working committee of the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament in the British occupation zone met today and decided to reject the suggestion to take immediate steps to establish a West German constitutional assembly, believing that this is impossible under the current state. The committee suggested that an administrative committee be formed by each West German state to determine, on a legal basis, what administrative responsibilities should be borne by the Germans or the Allied military government. Only after this step is taken can the establishment of a West German parliament be considered. The committee also requested the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament to hold a special meeting on July 14 and 15 to discuss the situation arising from the London Conference's recommendations.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] Well-informed sources say that General Koenig, the commander-in-chief of the French forces in Germany, believes that the merger of the French occupation zone with the British and American occupation zones can be completed by August 1, so the provisions of the London Agreement on foreign trade and transport cooperation in the three West German occupation zones can also be implemented from that date. These sources point out that the so-called foreign trade cooperation in the three occupation zones includes (1) France's participation in the joint import and export institutions of the British and American occupation zones; (2) joint drafting of import and export plans by the three occupation zones; (3) establishment of a single import and export revenue and expenditure institution; (4) in the future, the conclusion of economic treaties with foreign countries by West Germany will be handled by the unified authorities of the three zones.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] Eisenhower announced on the 5th that he has no intention of participating in the presidential election. He said that he cannot "involve himself in any party, accept any nomination for public office, or participate in political competition between political parties."

<h3 id="e57">Bizarre American State Laws: Divorce and Marriage Laws <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] The marriage and divorce laws of the various states are truly bizarre. After the Supreme Court recently ruled that states must recognize out-of-state divorces, people began to think about the differences in state laws. The states recognize twenty-eight different grounds for divorce, with a wide range. Divorce is not allowed in South Carolina for any reason. New York State only recognizes adultery as a ground for divorce. Kentucky recognizes the most grounds for divorce, reaching seventeen. New York lawyer Ma Gai compiled the laws of various states into a booklet called "Streamlining Marriage and Divorce Laws," stating that adultery is the most common ground for divorce, recognized by forty-seven states. Second is elopement, recognized by forty-five states. Next is abuse, recognized by forty-two states; committing a felony, recognized by forty-one states; and alcoholism, recognized by thirty-nine states. In addition to recognizing the above reasons, Kentucky also stipulates other reasons, including the wife being pregnant before marriage (assuming it is unrelated to the husband), the husband or wife wanting to murder the other party, or the wife being unfaithful (i.e., premarital fornication). Louisiana stipulates that divorce is allowed if the husband or wife publicly defames the other party's name. Forced marriage is a reason for divorce in Georgia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. Bad temper or violent behavior is stipulated as a ground for divorce in nine states. A shiftless husband is a ground for divorce in Missouri and Wyoming. Deception, fraud, bigamy, etc. are all grounds for divorce in eight states. The residency requirement for divorce applicants is at least one year in thirty-two states, and ranges from six weeks to three years in the remaining states. The differences in the marriage laws of the various states are even more bizarre than the divorce laws. Twenty-three states recognize common-law marriage, while the rest insist on some kind of law. Marriage to close relatives is prohibited by all states, but many states have expanded the prohibition, in addition to prohibiting marriage to a stepmother or mother-in-law, twenty-one states specifically prohibit marriage to a stepmother, twenty states prohibit marriage to a stepdaughter, nine states prohibit marriage to a grandmother, eleven states prohibit marriage to a granddaughter-in-law, sixteen states prohibit marriage to a granddaughter, and eighteen states prohibit marriage to a daughter-in-law. Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Vermont each prohibit paupers or those who depend on charitable organizations for relief from marrying. Thirty states prohibit whites from marrying blacks, sixteen states prohibit whites from marrying Asians or Mongolians, and five other states prohibit whites from marrying Indians.</p>

<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Prime Minister Ashida issued a statement on the 6th after the closure of the second session of the Diet. The main points are: "The power of the recent parliament has a tendency to split into small parties again. This strengthens the right wing and the far left camp, and shows that the middle road has somewhat weakened. This phenomenon, which harbors danger for the future of the political situation, must be deeply noted by us."</p>
<p>"Since the establishment of the Ashida cabinet, the environment has gradually improved, the production index has risen, and the food problem has been solved. In particular, the material assistance from the United States is increasing. The establishment of credit loans and material supplies has shown a bright future for Japan's economic recovery. In addition, as a result of recently permitting the release of large quantities of cotton cloth, the shortage of clothing can be greatly alleviated."</p>

<h3 id="e61">Overwhelming and Tumultuous: Typhoon Passes Through Shanghai, Causing Havoc; Land, Sea, and Air Transportation Disrupted; Heavy Losses in All Sectors <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The powerful typhoon, which had been swirling in the Pacific Ocean for three days, crossed over Taiwan on the 5th and then suddenly headed northwest at a speed of 14 to 24 miles per hour. Its center swept past Shanghai's eastern periphery (a few miles away) at 8:35 PM last night, turning northeast towards the Sea of Japan. The city remained within the typhoon's range all day. From 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM, it was constantly shrouded in fierce winds and torrential rain. The weather station hoisted four red lights, indicating that the center of the Force 8 typhoon was lingering near Shanghai. Consequently, all ships on the Huangpu River were docked and not sailing. Amidst the turbulent waves, countless barges and cargo ships appeared to capsize, and the losses are yet to be calculated. At the airport, only one Northwest Airlines flight from Tokyo landed safely at 8:00 AM. After 9:00 AM, the wind intensified, and all other passenger flights were canceled. US military aircraft stationed in the city were ordered to fly to Nanjing in the early morning to temporarily avoid the storm. Within the city, rainfall reached 1.31 inches within 24 hours. Combined with strong winds and the backflow of river water, the accumulated water could not drain properly, turning lower-lying areas such as Nanjing Road in front of Wing On Company, Route Cardinal Mercier in front of Cathay Mansions, and areas of Avenue Joffre and Route Pichon into watery expanses with water depths reaching above the knees. In particular, Avenue Joffre from Rue du Lieutenant Petiot to Route Tenant de la Tour, was flooded and the tram service of the French Tramways Company was suspended after 5:00 PM. The usually bustling Avenue Joffre was deserted at night, and nearby theaters and dance halls were desolate, presenting a particularly bleak scene. When the wind was at its fiercest around 11:00 AM yesterday, it felt like an overwhelming and tumultuous force. Countless houses, fences, street trees, and advertising signs were blown down in various districts of the city. The resulting tremors caused long-distance telephone lines to fail. Water and electricity facilities suffered significant damage. To avoid losses, most shops temporarily closed. Cars stalled in the streets were also a common sight. Tricycle and rickshaw businesses boomed. Fortunately, after 10:00 PM last night, the typhoon had left the area, and although there were still intermittent winds and rain, they were no longer a major threat. According to the weather station's forecast, the weather should improve this afternoon and will begin to clear up.</p>
<p>This typhoon, after reaching Taiwan, was originally headed directly towards the Xiamen area of Fujian. However, due to the southwest tropical air mass pushing eastward, and the high pressure of the Pacific air mass lingering near Okinawa, the typhoon changed direction to the north. At noon, it reached 28 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude. From then on, it proceeded north-northwest at a speed of 30 miles per hour. During the entire coastal path of the typhoon, the climate in various regions was severely affected. Nanjing experienced strong winds and rain, Fuzhou's wind reached Force 12, and Taiwan spent the entire day in strong winds of 60 to 70 miles per hour.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Many Ship Accidents on the River; Hang Li Ship Encountered Danger Returning to Shanghai <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The situation of ship accidents yesterday is summarized as follows: The Fuyu ship at buoys number 11 and 12 was about to load cargo and sail to Guangzhou. More than a dozen barges were parked alongside the ship. Because both the front and rear cables of the Fuyu ship were broken, the ship was blown by the wind and ran aground on the Puxi shore. As a result, most of the barges were hit, and seven or eight of them capsized one after another. The losses are countless, and the casualties are still under investigation. Two US landing craft, No. 1x103 and No. 1x187, parked at number 32 and 33, were also blown aground on the west bank. The Jiguang ship parked at 33 and 34, once had its cable broken, but was rescued in time, fortunately no accident occurred. The tanker Rooks Owner, parked at 36 and 37, and landing craft 1x173, parked at 38 and 39, were both blown to the west bank and ran aground.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Zhong Hang Company's Hangli ship encountered a typhoon attack on the Jiangmian near Shizilin at Baoshan Cape yesterday morning while carrying more than 300 passengers from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The ship was in imminent danger and sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai requesting rescue. However, due to the fierce winds, it was impossible to go out to rescue. As of the evening, there was still no news of the Hangli ship entering the port. Most of the ships leaving the port yesterday were suspended. The Jiangya and Jianglun ships suspended their respective departures. The American ship "Ge Gate" left the port yesterday morning and anchored at Sanjiaoshui to avoid the wind.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Passenger Trains on Two Lines Delayed <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Many traffic signals along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines were damaged, and telephone lines were also blown down. The "telegraph traffic control system" was temporarily adopted, and only one train was allowed to run between stations in one direction to avoid accidents. Furthermore, the speed of the locomotives was greatly reduced due to the strong wind resistance, and all trains could not arrive on time. Trains on the Jinghu line, including the 5th, 77th, 7th, 15th, 79th, 71st, 53rd, 3rd, and trains on the Huhang line, including the 64th, 26th, 22nd, 62nd, etc., were delayed by 30 minutes, one hour, one and a half hours, or two hours respectively.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Telephone Lines Disconnected</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, the bureau had 20 wired long-distance telephone lines from Shanghai to Nanjing (including along the Jinghu Railway) and 10 telephone lines from Shanghai to Hangzhou. Due to the impact of the typhoon, 18 lines on the Jinghu line and 9 lines on the Huhang line were out of order. Therefore, long-distance calls from Shanghai to various locations along the Jinghang lines could not be connected from 12:00 noon on the 6th. The bureau has dispatched technical personnel to repair them separately, and it is expected that communication will be restored on the morning of the 7th. As for local telephone lines, a few were obstructed.</p>
<p>Severe Damage to Water and Electricity</p>
<p>The damage to various water and electricity companies in the city was also extremely large. According to statistics from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, as of 5:00 PM on the 6th, more than 450 incidents of damage to pole sheds and power lines had occurred. The company dispatched more than 400 people to repair the damage in various sections. Several factories also suffered damage to motor power, including the China Textile Company. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company suffered the greatest losses in the city center and along Zhongshan North Road. In the Zhongshan North Road shantytown area, most shacks were covered with straw roofs. When the strong wind blew, the roofs were blown up and wrapped around the power lines, thus blocking the current. In some cases, horizontal timbers were blown up and broke the power lines. It is estimated that more than a quarter of the company's power lines in various sections were obstructed or damaged. A small number of the "4" and "9" prefix telephone numbers of the Shanghai Telephone Company were also damaged, and many intercom telephones were damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Eleven Men and Women Injured <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Section Chief Ye of the Police Bureau's Fire Department told reporters that during the hurricane that struck Shanghai yesterday, forming a strong wind and rainstorm, one fire, five cases of house collapse, and six cases of electrical leakage occurred in the city from morning to 6:00 PM. In addition to fire trucks, emergency ambulances were dispatched more than 20 times. Fortunately, each case was handled quickly, and no major disasters occurred. Eleven men and women were injured and sent to various hospitals for treatment. No one has died.</p>
<p>Fire</p>
<p>The aforementioned fire was a Western-style three-story house at No. 14, Lane 545, Xikang Road. All the furniture and miscellaneous items inside were burned, and part of the house was also burned. The fire started at 2:50 PM.</p>
<p>House Collapse</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a storm struck Shanghai. All air traffic from Shanghai to various places, except for the Shanghai-Taipei line, successfully took off before the typhoon struck in the early morning.

<h3 id="e67">Adjustments to Public Transportation Fares; Average Increase of One and a Half Times, Effective from the 9th; Each Company Requests Stepped-Up Crackdown on Ticketless Passengers <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The new fares for the four public transportation services in the city, including trams, public buses, small railways, and ferries, in July have been reviewed by the Public Utilities Bureau and approved by the mayor, and will be implemented from the 9th of this month. The new fares are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Trams: First class, 40,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan (originally 15,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan). Third class, 30,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan (originally 10,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan). The average increase is 156 percent.</p>
<p>(2) Public buses: 40,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan (originally 15,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan). The average increase is 156 percent.</p>
<p>(3) Small railways: 15,000 yuan per kilometer (originally 6,500 yuan). An increase of 130 percent.</p>
<p>(4) Ferries: 40,000 yuan for crossing the river (originally 15,000 yuan). 22,000 yuan per mile for long crossings (originally 8,000 yuan). The average increase is 170 percent.</p>
<p>It is reported that the rate of increase requested by each public transportation agency for the adjustment of fares was more than 300 percent. During the review by the Public Utilities Bureau, Director Zhao Cengjue tried his best to suppress it, assuming that ticketless rides could be effectively curbed, and then reduced it to around 150 percent. However, at that time, each company unanimously requested that the authorities immediately establish a unified inspection agency of military police and step up the crackdown on ticketless passengers, otherwise it would be impossible to maintain operations. At the same time, they also hoped that ordinary passengers could assist the company to report violations anytime and anywhere so that the company could maintain operations and avoid increasing the burden on ordinary passengers again.</p>
<p>New Telephone Rates Increase by Nearly Two Times on Average</p>
<p>As for the new telephone rates for this month, in the previous review meeting, because the company insisted that it must increase by at least 227 percent, the Public Utilities Bureau only allowed it to increase by 180 percent, resulting in a failure to approve the rates. It is now reported that the vice president and general manager of the telephone company, Fei Lanli, and others visited Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau the morning before yesterday. After Zhao repeatedly explained the principle of the government's efforts to be fair to all companies in adjusting prices, the company complied with the original adjusted percentage approved by the Public Utilities Bureau and implemented it from today. The new prices are as follows: Less than 200 calls: 40,000 yuan per call (originally 14,000 yuan) More than 200 calls: 65,000 yuan per call (originally 23,000 yuan) The average increase is 180 percent Public telephones: 50,000 yuan per call (originally 20,000 yuan) An increase of 150 percent</p>

The Qingdao meteorological station reported at 8:00 PM that the wind force in the area was strengthening and had reached Force 5, while a telegram from a ship south of Qingdao reported encountering a Force 8 typhoon. From this, it is speculated that the typhoon may enter Shandong Province.

<h3 id="e73">Great Tragedy on the Yangshupu River; Huge Waves Overturn Four Barges; More Than Ten Boatmen Without a Single Survivor; Cotton Cloth and Difficult Goods Drift All Over the River; Losses Amounting to Four or Five Hundred Billion Yuan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] During the typhoon that struck Shanghai, the waves on the Huangpu River were monstrous, and many ships capsized. Among them, the most tragic and the biggest loss was the capsizing of three barges of the Heyu Barge Transportation Company and one wooden barge of the Datonghe Transportation Company in the river area in front of the No. 11 and No. 12 buoys in front of the Ruyong Shipyard in Yangshupu. The former was fully loaded with cotton cloth, hard-to-find goods, and miscellaneous goods, and the latter was 100 pieces of cotton yarn. It is understood that the cotton yarn was owned by the Hengda New Ji Yarn Company at No. 260, Zhongzheng East Road in the city, and yesterday morning commissioned Datonghe and Heyu Transportation Companies to barge the goods to the No. 11 and No. 12 buoys for loading on the Fuyu ship of the Yixiang Shipping Company for export to Guangzhou. At about 11:00 AM, the two ships had arrived next to the Fuyu ship and were about to tie up the cables. However, the typhoon had arrived. At that time, there were two wooden barges next to the Fuyu ship transporting books (all elementary school textbooks published by the World Book Company) and miscellaneous goods such as cigarettes on behalf of Heyu Company. Unfortunately, the ships suddenly broke loose and, together with the newly arrived 20 barges, were swept by the huge waves. The goods on the four ships were immediately scattered all over the river, and with the help of the wind, they were washed away to the west. At this time, about ten boatmen on the four ships were swallowed by the huge waves, and none survived. Around 1:00 PM, more than 20 pieces of cotton yarn and miscellaneous goods had drifted to the Huangpu Park lighthouse in the Suzhou River. Many desperate people took the opportunity to rob the goods in the rain. The Jianghai Customs Port Police and the Water Police discovered this and urgently telegraphed the Flying Fortress of the Municipal Police Bureau to rush to suppress the situation and simultaneously salvage the goods. The owners of the Dasabao and the two barge companies went to the scene to handle the procedures for picking up the goods. It is heard that the loss of the goods on the four ships is estimated to be as high as four or five hundred billion yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Movie Industry Price Restriction Reduction Yesterday: Director Wu Expresses Disagreement <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Over ten representatives from the cinema industry and film distributors visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss the difficulties currently faced by the film industry. They argued that the 30% restriction on price-controlled seating was too high, and that the 200,000 yuan price limit for price-controlled tickets was too low. They requested that the price-controlled seating be reduced to 15% or that the price of price-controlled tickets be increased. Director Wu expressed his disagreement with this request. The conversation ended without resolution that night. When a reporter interviewed Director Wu yesterday, he stated: "The purpose of setting price-controlled seating is to allow those with slightly lower economic means to have the opportunity to see movies. Reducing the price-controlled seating or increasing the price of price-controlled tickets would defeat the original intention of setting price-controlled seating. The request from film distributors is not convenient to consider. Moreover, the price of price-controlled seating has been adjusted from 60,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, and then to the current 200,000 yuan, which is an increase of 140%, faster than the 100% increase in the cost of living index. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau has already allowed cinemas to freely adjust the prices of 70% of their seats, which provides room for maneuver. Therefore, the 30% price-controlled seating will still be strictly enforced, and ticket prices will not be allowed to increase."</p>

<h3 id="e90">Celebrating the First Army Day: Unfolding a New Page of Comprehensive Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Today is the 11th anniversary of the "July 7th" Resistance War, and it is also the first Army Day. General Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, specially wrote "A Letter to All Officers and Soldiers of the National Army," which is concise and meaningful. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>In the current stage of highly tense suppression of the rebellion, it is of great and profound significance for us to commemorate and celebrate this great festival, because in the past, the obstacle to our revolutionary nation-building was the external aggression of the Japanese invaders. Under the leadership of the Head of State, we have defeated it through eight years of resistance. Now, the obstacle to our revolutionary nation-building is the internal reactionary force of the communist bandits. We must, under the leadership of the Head of State, suppress and eliminate them through a longer period of rebellion suppression. "July 7th" opened the prelude to the War of Resistance and laid the foundation for "Victory in the War of Resistance." This first Army Day, which is also "July 7th", unfolds a new page of comprehensive rebellion suppression, showing the symbol of "Rebellion Suppression is Bound to Succeed, Nation-Building is Bound to Succeed." As the ancients said, "He who travels a hundred miles regards ninety as half the way." In order to accomplish the historical task of revolutionary nation-building, we must of course pay a heavy price. After the current arduous journey, we will never give up, continue our efforts, and move forward bravely towards this overall goal. On this great festival, we recall the glorious achievements of the past and face the current severe crisis. We feel that the tasks entrusted to our army are even more arduous, and the great cause of rebellion suppression and nation-building depends on the concerted efforts of the whole country to achieve it smoothly. We would like to elaborate on the following points to inform all officers and soldiers of our entire army:</p>
<p>(1) Fulfilling the Soldier's Natural Duty and Maintaining the Glory of the Army – The natural duty of a soldier is to "defend the country and protect the people," which is universally recognized both in ancient times and today. In the past, the revolutionary army in the Northern Expedition took the slogan "Not greedy for money, not afraid of death, love the country, love the people," to overthrow the warlords, complete national unification, and relieve the suffering of the people. Therefore, the people welcomed the national army with food and drinks. Later, in the eight years of bloody War of Resistance, our soldiers wrote many glorious historical records in order to safeguard national sovereignty and protect the survival of the nation, laying the foundation for the final victory and earning a lofty international status as one of the "Four Powers." However, with the advent of victory, the evil communist bandits launched a full-scale armed rebellion, causing our international status to plummet, and the country and nation to encounter an unprecedented crisis in history. We revolutionary soldiers bear the heavy responsibility of "defending the country and protecting the people." Seeing the weeds growing all over the land and the cries of the starving everywhere, we must not feel pain in our hearts, pick up our banners again, and swear to not return until the communist bandits are destroyed, in order to quell the rebellion, stabilize the people's livelihood, and resolve the crisis of the country and nation, so as to fulfill the natural duty of soldiers and maintain the glory of the army.</p>
<p>(2) Promoting Military Virtue and Cultivating the Integrity of Soldiers – The Head of State has instructed us: "Since ancient times in China, true soldiers must emphasize military virtue. The so-called military virtue is 'wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness'." Military virtue is the essential spirit of soldiers, that is, the soul of our soldiers. If soldiers do not emphasize military virtue, do not have the spirit of soldiers, and lose the soul of soldiers, they will not become soldiers, especially not revolutionary soldiers." It can be seen that we must cultivate military virtue before we can use tactics. Only with noble military virtue can we achieve the greatest victory. The so-called "wisdom", in addition to the military knowledge and skills that should be possessed, must also "distinguish right from wrong, understand advantages and disadvantages, recognize the times, and know oneself and the enemy." The so-called "trustworthiness" is "three kinds of confidence": confidence in oneself, trust in subordinates, and faith in superiors. The so-called "benevolence" is love, that is, universal love, to be able to love the country, love the people, love subordinates, and love compatriots. The so-called "courage" is not being afraid, to be able to take risks, endure hardship and hard work, not be moved by poverty or wealth, and not yield to force. The so-called "strictness" is being strict and fair, to be able to be strict with oneself, strict with others, and strict in dealing with things, especially to be strict and fair in rewards and punishments. Among the five, "benevolence" is the center of military virtue, and "strictness" is the most important of military virtue. It is even more important to use "sincerity" to exercise "wisdom", to use sincerity to show "trustworthiness", to use sincerity to practice "benevolence", to use sincerity to employ "courage", and to use sincerity to demonstrate "strictness". The Head of State has also instructed us: "Revolutionary soldiers must emphasize integrity the most. To emphasize integrity, we must first value propriety and righteousness, and know shame. Valuing propriety and righteousness means knowing how to respect integrity. Respecting integrity means being able to unite spirits and be consistent from top to bottom. Knowing shame means knowing life and death. Knowing life and death means not caring about any sacrifice." Therefore, we revolutionary soldiers must follow the instructions of the Head of State, promote military virtue, cultivate integrity, not retreat when injured, not surrender when captured, not collapse when defeated, not panic when surrounded, hold the belief that victory is inevitable, embrace the determination to die, and set an example for the military and civilians to overcome the enemy.</p>
<p>(3) Completing the Bandit Suppression Mission and Realizing the Military Building Plan – Bandit suppression is not internal turmoil, but suppressing rebellion. Rebellion suppression is not destroying peace, but seeking lasting unity and peace. Our soldiers, in order to fulfill their natural duty, must be of one mind from top to bottom, cooperate with the military and civilians, and coordinate the army, navy, and air force to eliminate them with all their strength. However, the communist bandits are organized and strategic, and they are using their strategies everywhere to incite the masses, deceive the masses, and threaten the masses to carry out so-called "joining the army", "land reform", and "grabbing grain" movements in order to enrich their sources of troops and military pay. Therefore, military force alone is not enough to cope with the current situation. We must implement the principle of "military, political, and economic unity" and implement "total war" to smash all the communist bandits' conspiracies and measures in the military, political, and economic aspects. In addition, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the bandit situation, frankly review and strengthen training, strive for improvement, and strive to take the initiative everywhere. In this way, we can complete the task of bandit suppression. Furthermore, due to the advent of the atomic age, mankind is on the dividing line between "extinction" and "survival." Although the Second World War has ostensibly ended, the international mistrust has not been completely eliminated, and the seeds of war are still being sown in secret. In order to "take precautions", we should actively strengthen national defense to prevent accidents. Although war is tending towards "three-dimensionality", the army, as the backbone of national defense, still maintains its most important position. "Nation-building must first build the army". Although our military building plan has been obstructed by the communist bandits and cannot be realized immediately, it should still be gradually realized without affecting the military conditions for bandit suppression in order to strengthen our national defense, protect the survival and independence of the country and nation, and strive for the freedom and equality of the country and nation.</p>

<p>The Great Iron Buddha Still Stands Tall</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 4th] Guangfu Temple in the city was originally the Qianming and Guangfu Temples, with 5,040 rooms. In the ninth year of the Qiandao reign, it was merged into one. In the 42nd year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty, the two wings of the temple were divided and rebuilt into the school envoy's office. It was the departmental institute for testing students from the eight counties of Changzhou Prefecture in the Qing Dynasty. It has Zhao Mengfu's record of rebuilding the Guanyin Hall. The temple was destroyed by fire during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom War in the Gengshen year of Xianfeng reign. In the temple, there is a large iron Buddha, which is said to have been built by Liu Bowen during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty to suppress Feng Shui. The iron Buddha is very large, sitting in a squatting position, with a diameter of fifteen square feet and a height of seven English feet. It is entirely cast from pig iron and covered with gold. When Zeng Wenzheng and Zuo Wenxiang and the Qing court were ruling, this iron Buddha was rebuilt and enshrined in the temple. It still stands tall today. Now, in order to preserve historical sites, the Buddhist Association has repaired and opened the temples for people to visit.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 5th] Since the exposure of the embezzlement case in the Field and Grain Office of this county, the staff members Wu Bangyu, Shou Xuefan, and Secretary Lu Pinjin, after being arrested, have successively absconded without a trace. The provincial government has ordered the county government to strictly pursue the guarantors and be responsible for handing over the criminals Wu and Shou, and has ordered the police to seriously arrest them and bring them to justice according to law. The county court, because Lu Pinjin escaped while on bail and his whereabouts are unknown, will also petition the High Court for his arrest. At the county council's interrogation of the Field and Grain Office on the fourth, the embezzlement case was seriously investigated, and it was also found that Tianfeng Rice Mill had misappropriated more than 3,500 stones of tax grain. In the entry and exit accounts, it was discovered that there was a 20 million yuan bribe paid to the prison levy association, 15 million yuan paid to Wang of the provincial office through Lu Pinjin's hands, 150 stones of grain given to Ren Mingda, and 20 million yuan paid to Han Jianping (resident factory staff). When the investigators reported this on the spot, the entire audience was shocked, and the main people were thoroughly investigated and dealt with severely.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the third, Lang Zhaobin (24 years old, from Huai'an), a worker at the Provincial Hospital here, was boiling medical equipment in the operating room when he accidentally caused gasoline from the gasoline stove to spray out and burn him. Lang shouted "Oh no!" The doctors at the hospital rushed over when they heard the noise, but Lang was already covered in burns. After injecting saline, plasma, and other emergency treatments, his injuries were too severe, and he died at 10:00 PM that night. The hospital considered him to have died in the line of duty. The funeral expenses were all borne by the hospital.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wuxi is currently experiencing a severe shortage of cash, causing merchants great pain. They have requested relief from the National Bank, but there is no way to help. The reasons for the shortage of cash are: (1) Some people are transporting large amounts of cash to Shanghai. (2) Some bank wives are causing trouble by manipulating the situation and secretly engaging in speculative business. (3) Money shops are paying out and collecting discounts. (4) The exchange of small bills is indefinite, and they are piled up in the warehouse. Because of these reasons, there is a strange shortage of cash. Certain parties are currently investigating the bank wives' engagement in speculative business in order to thoroughly investigate and suppress the rising trend.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Suzhou City Defense Command reported that Zhang Guojun claimed to have been ordered by the Ministry of National Defense to establish a Taihu District Separate Mourning Detachment in Suzhou. Zhang Guojun reinstated Guo Liang, who had served as the commander of the puppet army's Third Division, to rally Taihu bandits and anti-Japanese soldiers. Zhang Guojun has already recruited over a thousand men and guns, and they are being gathered for inspection. Because the department also serves as the first sub-district of the Taihu Garrison Area of the Capital Garrison Headquarters and has been fully engaged in the Taihu Clear-up Operation, implementing both suppression and pacification in an effort to eliminate the bandits, it is believed that Zhang Guojun's actions are close to swindling.

<h3 id="e96">The Spark of the Lugou Bridge <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>By Our Newspaper's Archives</p>
<p>Eleven years ago today, at the location known as one of the "Ten Scenic Spots of Yantai," "Lugou at Dawn Under the Moon," due to the provocation of the Japanese invaders, the prelude to the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan was staged. Today, on this very anniversary, let us relive that nightmare.</p>
<p>In mid-June of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Japanese garrison troops stationed in Fengtai and Beiping (Beijing) conducted field exercises in the suburbs of Beiping for more than ten days, with constant sounds of gunfire and artillery. On July 7th, the exercise progressed to the Lugou Bridge area on the outskirts of Wanping. In the evening, four Japanese soldiers were reported missing, and a request was made to search inside Wanping County, which was not granted. The Japanese army's posture was aggressive, almost attempting to forcefully enter the city, but they did not dare to act rashly due to the strict defenses of the garrison. The two sides were deadlocked until midnight, when the Japanese army suddenly bombarded Wanping city and Lugou Bridge with artillery, followed by an infantry attack. Our garrison, with the responsibility to defend the territory, also ordered a counterattack for self-defense. Thus, the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred.</p>
<p>At that time, the troops stationed in Wanping were the Third Battalion of the 37th Division, led by Ji Xingwen. Ji Xingwen was stationed in Changxindian, and upon hearing the news, he rushed to Wanping within two hours to personally command the battle. On the morning of the 8th, the battle situation was extremely fierce. The enemy's battalion commander, Major Ichiki Kiyonao, was killed in action, and the deputy commander of the regiment, Morita, was also injured on the evening of the 9th, with almost all of the soldiers in that unit killed or wounded. Subsequently, the enemy transferred the Kawabe Brigade and the Suzuki Division from Tongzhou, the Hata Tank Regiment from the Northeast, Baron Tokukawa's accompanying detachment, the Yasukuni Takanaga Detachment, the Doihara Detachment, and the 6th and 20th Divisions, totaling more than 100,000 men, under the command of Tashiro, the commander of the North China Garrison Army. Tashiro died at the Fengtai garrison on the night of the 17th and was replaced by Commander Katsuki.</p>
<p>Although the enemy forces repeatedly reinforced their troops, our army remained calm and fought back. Fierce battles took place at Babaoshan and Yamenkou, with countless enemy soldiers killed. Later, Ji Xingwen's unit retreated to Changxindian and was replaced by the Security Third Brigade under Dai Shouyi, and then Chen Chunrong's unit stationed in Baoding was transferred to Changxindian as a second line of defense. The two sides held their positions for more than twenty days, and Wanping city and Lugou Bridge were never lost. On the 29th, the defense of the two locations was taken over by friendly forces.</p>
<p>While the battle situation at Lugou Bridge was deadlocked, the enemy army, seeing that their goal was not achieved, shifted their battle lines and attacked Liu Zhensan's Brigade stationed in Langfang Huangcai, and also bombed them with aircraft. Due to the suddenness of the attack, the losses were quite heavy. Seeing that the Japanese invaders were so unreasonable, our army urgently transferred Zhao Dengyu's 132nd Division stationed in Hejian to Nanyuan, to defend the suburbs of Beiping. At that time, the enemy had transferred a large number of reinforcements from Tianjin and assembled in Fengtai. Zhao Dengyu's unit was attacked by the enemy before their deployment was completed. After a fierce battle all day, the soldiers suffered heavy casualties, but their morale was still extremely high, truly a commendable and tearful scene.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Japanese invaders originally wanted to follow the old plan of the September 18th Incident, and seize Beiping without bloodshed. As early as a week before the incident, Song Zheyuan had already felt the difficulty of dealing with Japan. After the incident occurred, Japan still wanted to express that it was a misunderstanding and was willing to withdraw from Lugou Bridge, but they needed to send a train to transport troops back to Beiping. Upon hearing this, all parties strongly opposed it, but our side, for the sake of settling the matter peacefully, ultimately dispatched cars to transport the Japanese army back to the city. On the day the Japanese army entered the city, the line of cars was packed with soldiers, but the exact number was unknown.</p>
<p>At that time, the Japanese invaders in North China were extremely arrogant. The authorities, adhering to the principle of "never giving up peace until hope is exhausted, and never lightly mentioning sacrifice until the final moment of sacrifice," always hoped to resolve the situation as a local incident. However, the enemy invaders did not have the sincerity to negotiate, but merely prolonged the time for reinforcing their troops, repeatedly creating unnecessary obstacles and delaying the situation. On the other hand, they continued to transfer troops into the customs, provoking incidents, and peace was clearly becoming an impossible wish. On July 17th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech in Lushan, revealing a solemn stance, saying: "(1) No solution should infringe upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity; (2) The administrative organization of Hebei and Chahar should not be subject to any illegal changes; (3) Local officials appointed by the central government, such as Song Zheyuan, the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, should not be removed at the request of others; (4) The 29th Route Army should not be subject to any restrictions in the area where it is currently stationed." Finally, he solemnly declared: "We hope for peace but do not seek temporary ease, and we are prepared to meet our responsibilities but will never seek war. We know that after a nationwide war of resistance begins, there will only be sacrifice to the end, with no possibility of avoiding it through luck. If the war begins, then there will be no distinction between North and South, no distinction between old and young, and everyone will have the responsibility to defend the territory and resist aggression, and everyone should be determined to sacrifice everything." This solemn declaration clearly showed China's maximum limit for striving for peace and the final determination to strive for survival.</p>
<p>After this statement was issued, the Japanese invaders knew that it was impossible to solve this matter through the route of the September 18th Incident, so they further exposed their hideous faces and aggressive ambitions, and repeatedly invaded our army. Finally, Song Zheyuan resolutely rejected an unreasonable ultimatum presented by the Japanese army, and the next day he was ordered to carry out a strong resistance. By this point, the Lugou Bridge Incident, which had been negotiated for more than twenty days, had clearly exceeded the scope of a local incident, and the war between China and Japan was expanding from a local conflict to a full-scale war.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Mayor Responds to Grain Industry Request to Raise Price Limits. Grain Market Reopens Yesterday. <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Price of white rice not to exceed $20 million per dan.</p>
<p>The management committees and representatives of the city's North and South rice markets, as well as the five major markets for flour, bran, oil cakes, and miscellaneous grains, including Xing Zhigang, Qiu Fuxiang, Zhang Chao, Yang Dingchen, Zhou Wanchao, Shan Wenjun, Hu Wenan, and Cha Baosan, petitioned the city government jointly at 8:00 AM yesterday, requesting an increase in price limits so that market transactions could be brought back on track. Mayor Wu immediately telegraphed Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian to discuss the matter. After deliberation, it was decided in principle that the price of rice would not exceed $20 million, and for edible oil, soybean oil would not exceed $45 million, rapeseed oil $42 million to $43 million, with the vegetable oil factory responsible for the supply. For miscellaneous grains, soybeans would not exceed $10 million, wheat $75 million, and for flour, "warship" flour would be $54 million.</p>
<p>Further reports: To understand the edible oil supply situation, Mayor Wu convened representatives from the Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association, including Qiu Liangrong, Li Tingdong, and Xie Yuxiang, at the city government at 4:00 PM yesterday to inquire about everything. The oil merchant representatives reported to the mayor that three days prior, Zhongzhi Oil Factory, in conjunction with other major private oil factories, had actually sold over 3,500 dans of rapeseed oil on the market at $36.5 million. Subsequently, the mayor provided detailed instructions on issues such as future edible oil supply price standards.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shantou market opened yesterday with factory soybean oil at a uniform $45 million and raw rapeseed oil at $43 million.</p>
<p>Further reports: The price limit for rice was raised to $20 million yesterday, and a small number of transactions have already taken place in the market. However, high-quality rice is still absent, with only medium-quality and second-quality japonica and early rice being traded at the limited price. There is a greater supply of milled indica and common indica rice, etc. Because prices in production areas such as Wuxi are high, this limited price is not sufficient to cover the cost of high-quality rice. The off-market prices for superior white japonica and thin rice are both quoted at $22 million, and high-quality indica rice is also quoted at this price. Yesterday, a total of 17,790,000 shih (a unit of dry measure) arrived at the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Has not yet been formally traded. Yesterday, because the price had not been decided, it was necessary to wait for the authorities to discuss with the factory before making a decision. Trading could not be initiated. Bran was also not offered in the morning. According to general expectations, trading may resume today, with wheat at $8.5 million.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>

<p>Hua stocks opened high yesterday morning and then fell back. Only small stocks like Qinxing rose to the limit. Jinglun, Yongan, Lianan, and Xinhua showed promise, while the remaining stocks showed slight fatigue near noon. The market then recovered and surged again. Yongshen rose to the limit and then needed to be marked up again. Almost all stocks rose, with many emerging as strong performers. Before closing, stocks struggled to rise. The exuberance from the previous day had not diminished in the morning. When it opened, Yongshen rose to 6,850 yuan, a new high. Although number 220 bought in, numbers 76 and 129 quickly sold off, falling to 6,500 yuan. However, numbers 157 and 65 still had buying interest. Brokerage fees opened low at 134 yuan and 140 yuan, but still rose back to 6,700 yuan. There were not many chips. Jinglun, Yonggong, and Xinhua, which had been lagging behind, rose steadily. Dongxing even reached the limit. However, the bulls did not overextend themselves, and a large number of high-level suppliers continued to emerge. The young generation Min numbers 52, 13, and 71, as well as Cantonese numbers 95 and 218, Banking numbers 207 and 11, and major players numbers 143, 219, and 157 closed, pushing prices down to 6,480 yuan.

Huaxin, Xinguang, Jingfu, Matches, and Domestic Goods fell by one-tenth and one-half respectively, with the remaining stocks showing little rise or fall.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yongshen appeared at 6,750 yuan. Although numbers 174, 185, and 226 sold to 6,650 yuan, it quickly recovered. Various small stocks and miscellaneous stocks successively created an almost full red market. Yongshen was also advanced to the limit price of 6,965 yuan. National Bank exchange was shorted and then raised to 100 yuan to 150 yuan. Finally, large accounts strongly sold, returning slightly to around the limit rise.

<p>It is reported that the Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Government Property Materials Committee, has conducted five rounds of tenders for finished products purchased by the administrative agencies last year. This week will be the sixth tender for finished products, and the bidding is scheduled to open on Thursday (the 8th). Furthermore, in order to cooperate with the authorities in suppressing prices, the committee will expedite the handling of future tenders for finished products. It is said that as of recently, the finished products sold account for only 5% of the total amount.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Prices Rise Gradually; Bank Deposits Decrease <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Recently, according to an authoritative source from a commercial bank: Although all banks and firms in the city had surpluses in the previous settlement period, they will all find business difficult in the next period. The reason is that due to the gradual rise in prices, deposits will inevitably decrease day by day. At the same time, the cost of living is increasing daily, and expenses are also gradually increasing. It is even more difficult for smaller banks and firms to maintain operations.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Green Tea's Foothold Solidified <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Tea market transactions mostly stalled yesterday due to incessant gales and rainstorms, coupled with tight credit conditions in the market. Therefore, buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and various varieties did not officially open. Holders are optimistic, unwilling to sell. Quotations rose slowly, so that the trend was loose at the beginning of the morning, and the outlook for the night was also optimistic, and especially for Zhenmei green tea, because the cost of reproduction increased day by day, the price increase was more vigorous, and the result was that the bottom was extremely solid at the close.</p>
<p>In addition, according to reporters' inquiry to the tea industry: On the 18th of this month, the Maleke wheel, which will sail to Africa, will have more than 10,000 boxes of green tea shipped to that place by tea exporters in the city, but most of them are old tea, and there are very few new goods. Although foreign countries are very fond of new tea, they are reluctant to buy it because the price is too high. As for various old goods, because their selling price is relatively low, they can still be sold abroad. But the color, aroma, and taste are difficult to have everything, so if this continues, the sales volume of Chinese tea will not only be difficult to double, but the credibility in the international market will fall.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Woolen Fabric Trading Quiet <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Zero-sum transactions of woolen fabrics turned clear yesterday, because it was a time of shortage of crops in May and June. Inflation for two weeks reached a peak. Under today's high prices, the public gradually lacks the ability to purchase woolen clothing, a semi-luxury item. In addition, the high interest rate of 13 or 4 points is also related. As for standard market quotations, they have temporarily stopped rising, but due to the high opening price of Zhongfang's (Central Textile's) fabrics on Monday, most of them turned firm.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Building Materials Rise <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In the building materials market of bricks, tiles, lime, and mud, with the increase in the cost of living and the increase in labor costs, and also encountering typhoons and rainstorms, houses have been blown down and need to be repaired. Therefore, this street has been very healthy for the stomach, and the market has been rising steadily. Green bricks have risen wildly to 300 million yuan per 10,000, machine-made red bricks 450 million yuan, green tiles 150 million yuan, and machine-made red tiles have also risen to 210 million yuan per thousand. Lime is 3.7 million yuan per dan, Taishan cement is 4.6 million yuan per bag, Ma brand hemp bags are 9.2 million yuan, and other yellow sand and gravel have risen by 20-30% compared to the previous week.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] Wang Lanseng, acting chairman of the Yarn Management Committee, went to Beijing on the 5th to request instructions on how to stabilize yarn and cloth prices. Before leaving, he hand-ordered the committee's supervisory office to cooperate with military and police personnel to strictly monitor the yarn and cloth market. Also, regarding the distribution of US-aided raw cotton, after repeated discussions, no concrete decision has been made. The Yarn Management Committee will meet again within a few days to produce a concrete solution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Further reports: The Post-War People's Textile Factory Re-establishment Committee (including the five provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Hubei, and Hunan), recently considering that US-aided cotton is about to be transported to China in a continuous stream, has telegraphed the Yarn Management Committee and the US Aid Utilization Committee, requesting average assistance based on the actual number of spindles open nationwide, and has sent Director-General Shi Fengxiang, Pan Yangshan, and Li Guowei as representatives to Beijing to negotiate.</p>

<p>Yesterday's yarn market situation was that factories were forced by tight credit to sell in the market, and local dyeing and weaving factories wanted to replenish their supplies because they had not received raw materials for several days. However, the police presence was still strict, and brokers were afraid and dared not intervene, so no open or concealed transactions took place.</p>
<p>Further reports: It is said that a small number of direct transactions took place between the firms and the dyeing and weaving factories. It is calculated that 42-count Blue Phoenix quoted 940 million yuan for immediate delivery, 1 billion yuan for delivery the next day, 32-count Silver Moon around 900 million yuan, 21-count Double Horse quoted 750 million yuan for immediate delivery, 820-30 million yuan for delivery the next day. 20-count Tiannv, Hongkui star, are both 700 million yuan, Jincheng 710 million yuan, 16-count Guangming 610 million yuan strong, all quoted for immediate delivery.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] This year's agricultural loans handled by the Agricultural Bank were originally determined to be 10 trillion, and by the end of last month, more than 70% had been loaned out, including items such as cotton, food, and water conservancy, totaling more than 7 trillion. The funds that can be used in the second half of this year are less than 3 trillion, which is absolutely insufficient to meet actual needs given the current price situation.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Bank is now preparing a new plan to recompile the new agricultural loan budget. Taking the acquisition of agricultural product processing as an example, the original amount will be increased by five loans, so the total amount of agricultural loans in the second half of the year will require at least 10 trillion. This new budget will be sent to the Joint Council for approval after it is completed.</p>
<p>Also, when the Agricultural Bank promoted agricultural loans in the first half of the year, it adopted a real-object loan method, and seeds and fertilizers were prepared early, so it was able to avoid the impact of price fluctuations.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions returned to normal, but the police control was still strict. All parties held a wait-and-see attitude, and the trading inside the market was still clear. Leading fine cloth traded at 26 million yuan outside the market.</p>
<p>Later, it was heard that large amounts of customs gold had been issued in Guangzhou and other places. People's hearts were soaring, and there were many who bought low due to ample funds, and quotations stepped up to 27.2 million yuan. In the end, because of stagnant real sales and not many customers, and there were many floating shorts selling off, it returned slightly to end at 26.2 million. Slightly higher than the previous day. Fine cloths such as Wufu, Leading B, Loudspeaker Child, and Four Gentlemen gabardine, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and shilin cloth on the market have strong appeal from the same industry, and the market atmosphere is more profitable than the previous closure.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Crisis in the Textbook Industry, Huge Printing Costs, Book Shortage in Autumn Awaits Sound Solutions <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The busy period for printing and transporting textbooks for the autumn semester has arrived. The heads of the textbook industry in the city, Zhu Jingnong, Li Shuming, Jiang Zhicheng, Li Hongqiu, Fan Xiren, Zhang Yiqu, Liu Baimin, Li Bojia, Zhou Xihe and others, have been repeatedly discussing recently in order to cope with soaring costs and to eliminate the book shortage. When the reporter inquired about the situation yesterday, they shared their collective opinions. According to them, there are about 23 million primary school students nationwide, and the required textbooks are all nationally designated versions, totaling about 70 million volumes; in secondary schools, there are about 1.5 million middle school students, 250,000 normal school students, and 190,000 vocational school students, requiring about 25 million volumes of textbooks. The total cost of printing the nationally designated textbooks is estimated to be nearly 10 trillion yuan in national currency, a huge sum. The textbook industry is heavily burdened during this suppression of turmoil. A loss of one city invariably means a loss. For example, in the recent Battle of Kaifeng, the direct loss of the Shanghai textbook industry in Henan Province is estimated to be above 5 trillion. Recovering from this huge blow is not easy. It can be seen that the publishing industry is operating in a bleak environment, and the difficulty is no less than during the War of Resistance Against Japan. When the Seven-Organization Office closed last spring, colleagues estimated that there were about 80 million nationally designated books in stock, scattered in various places. Therefore, reprinting and supplementing supplies last autumn and this spring felt easy and there was no fear of shortages. Now, the stock is running out, transportation is even more blocked than before, and it is already July, and the printing and transportation period is imminent. The selling price of nationally designated books is restricted by the Ministry of Education, barely enough to cover the cost of paper and printing, and there is no source for various management expenses. The huge cost of production and the high interest rates of various banks make people hesitate. The textbook industry feels that this difficult topic of the book shortage in autumn is difficult to bear. In addition to reporting detailed information to the Ministry of Education, they hope that the central government can deeply understand the difficulties of the times and properly plan for relief measures.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Royal Botanic Gardens, UK Hosts World Games Athletes; Sixty Sports Fields in London Allotted for Practice <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London Dispatch] On the 29th of this month, the Olympic torch, passed down from the Olympic Village in southern Greece, will be handed to the final relay runner at Wembley Stadium, igniting the Olympic flame. King George VI will officially open the 14th World Games, lasting for fourteen days.</p>
<p>To accommodate athletes from sixty countries participating in the World Games, the UK has converted a wartime military sanatorium in southwest London into accommodation. This accommodation is located within Richmond Park, covering 2,250 acres, which was once a deer hunting ground for Charles I. Later, after Henry, Duke of Richmond, became King in 1485, he continued to maintain a close relationship with successive British emperors.</p>
<p>In addition to Richmond Park, many other military camps have also been converted into accommodation for athletes. Furthermore, sixty sports fields in London have been allocated for Olympic athletes to use for practice. During the Games, besides athletes from various countries competing under the observation of 10,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium, speedboat races will be held on the southwest coast of England, and cycling and wrestling competitions will be held in and around London.</p>
<p>Although nominally the 14th World Games, due to wartime interruptions, this is actually only the 11th Games. This is in stark contrast to the ancient Greek tradition, where the Olympic Games could not be stopped by war; rather, warfare could only resume after the Games concluded, the champions were selected, and the gods were revered.</p>

<p>Opening on July 19th</p>
<p>The Qin Wang Cup Table Tennis League, organized by the Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, held a joint meeting of all committee members and team representatives the day before yesterday. First, Executive Secretary Chen Mou-sheng reported on the participation of 73 teams. Then, Chairman Wang Yi explained the revised world table tennis rules. Subsequently, team representatives spoke one after another, unanimously hoping to cancel the name "Qin Wang Cup." The committee accepted this suggestion and decided to change it to the Shanghai Third Table Tennis League. The competition is scheduled to begin on July 19th and will be divided into three groups: A, B, and C. Each group will adopt a single round-robin system, with rankings determined by the number of points accumulated. The 16 venues for the competition are designated as: Jingwu General Branch, Pudong, Choubai, Fajian, Siming, Hu Cai, Dongting, Lvying, Taiping, Postal Service, China Merchants, Chunmao, Yinglian, and Zhenqie. Wang Yi is responsible for compiling and printing the complete list of participants, which must be sent to each team before the competition. Each team will be allocated three dozen discounted competition hard balls, and participating teams can collect them from the association next week upon presentation of their membership receipt.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Review of the 62nd Tournament: The Wimbledon Doubles: The Unregarded Australian Team Overwhelms the Crowd; Miss He Ai Ying's Skills Rapidly Improve and She Emerges <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[Our Special Feature] In the Wimbledon Men's Doubles, Fagunburg and Kramo teamed up last year to be invincible, winning the championship. This year, paired with Paike, the top seed in singles, they were the most vocal contenders for the title and were selected as the top-seeded team. The second seed was Tombulun and Moluoai. Although Bulangweiqu is a doubles master, because Xuegeman's skills were not particularly strong, they were ranked third, within Paifa's division. General predictions were that the Australian team would not even make it to the finals this time. Unexpectedly, Paike was no longer the hero of the past. In the semi-finals, during the America-Australia meeting, Paifa fought with all his might. Although they had a 2-1 lead in one set, time had taken its toll, and after the Buxue team tied the score, Paier was exhausted. Only the 22-year-old Fagunburg was holding up the building alone. Buxue then took advantage of the remaining strength and easily won the final set 6-1, securing the right to the finals.</p>
<p>Sweden's Beijielin was a dark horse at this year's Wimbledon. In the singles, he eliminated the top player Paike. Partnering with Haber in doubles, they eliminated the fourth-seeded team of South African national player Shidejisi and British Davis Cup representative Tuoming in three straight sets during the quarter-finals. Although they lost to Tombulun and Moluoai 2-3 in the semi-finals, the selected team took the lead twice, and in the final set, they lost 6-8 after "Deuce" twice.</p>
<p>The final was again a contest between America and Australia. Although the United States won the first set 7-5, Tombulun's sudden loss of form made Moluoai's excellent performance in vain. If Moluoai had performed like this in singles, he would not have been defeated 0-3 by Fagunburg. Under the situation that Bulangweiqu and Yougeman were unable to resist with one hand against two, they won three sets 7-5, 7-5, and 9-7, winning the doubles title and compensating for the humiliation of being defeated by a beauty in singles.</p>
<p>The women's doubles was the Wimbledon championship with the fewest upsets this year. The seeded teams advanced smoothly with almost no resistance. China's overseas player He Ai Ying, partnering with British Aosibeng, broke through three levels, and only reached the last eight teams, before being defeated 1-2 by the fourth-seeded British Bausituoke and Buliya. Since winning the grass court tennis championship, He Ai Ying's skills have improved further. In the Wimbledon singles, she was unfortunately eliminated by Mrs. DuPont in the second week, but Miss He's skill was admired by people inside and outside the circle. The failure to advance further in doubles was mainly due to the weakness of her partner. If He Ai Ying had partnered with an American instead of the British Osibeng, she might not have had the hope of winning the championship and adding a brilliant page to the history of Chinese sports.</p>
<p>Competing for the women's doubles title were Bailu and DuPont, and Hede and Dute, who also swept the semi-finals of the women's singles, the four American heroes, and long-time winners of the Weightman Cup. Both pairs had not lost a set since the preliminary round. After 27 games, Bailu and DuPont finally won 2-1 against Hede and Dute with superior skills, avenging the shame of being humiliated in the finals of the previous seven tournaments.</p>
<p>The mixed doubles champion was again won by Bailu and Bulangweiqu. Both Bai and Bulangweiqu are particularly skilled in doubles. They defeated Teluobonidu and Mrs. Te 5-7, 6-1, and 8-6 in the semi-finals, and then defeated another American-Australian mixed team, Xuegeman and Hede, 6-2, 3-6, and 6-3 in the finals. Xue and Hede eliminated the second seed Tombulun and Mrs. DuPont 2-1 in the semi-finals, creating the only upset in the mixed doubles.</p>
<p>In the first Wimbledon after the war, Bailu partnered with Osibeng and Tombulun, winning the women's doubles and mixed doubles titles. However, she was defeated by Zhizhi in the singles final, failing to achieve complete success. This year, Mrs. DuPont regressed after marriage, so Bailu was able to sweep three championships and become a tennis champion, comparable to Mrs. Madi and Miss Mabaier in the past (the last sentence of the original Japanese text is wrong, Beizhi is Mabaier).</p>
<p>Bulangweiqu also won two doubles championships this year. Unfortunately, he lost to Fagunburg in the singles final, failing to achieve complete success. Otherwise, the tennis king and queen would not have allowed Buji and Mrs. Madi to be unique in 1939 (below). (Zou Dingxin)</p>

<h3 id="e125">Reader's Opinions: The Suffering Children: How Will We Shape Your Generation? <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>

<p>— Fundraising for the Bethany Orphanage Building Fund</p>
<p>"May all orphans in the world be sheltered by social parents, and may all war orphans become future heroes of the country." This is the author's long-held wish. Recently, I learned that the Bethany Orphanage's buildings were forced to be relocated, and it is bound to start from scratch. I am moved by the achievements of the orphanage and am willing to donate to expand its base. We have made a vow that, in addition to protecting the existing orphans and preventing them from being displaced, we plan to focus on educating and nurturing the orphans of war martyrs and the orphans of the internal turmoil that has plagued us for the past two years - the heroic souls of war martyrs, the broad souls sacrificed in the internal turmoil, who has no parents, who has no children, saving the children is the responsibility of us who have not died!</p>
<p>Suffering children! How will we account for your next generation? Parents in the world! Arise, this group of suffering seedlings, who will grow up to be the national soul of our Chinese nation! Let us think: Our Chinese nation, for five thousand years, has experienced destruction and arduous struggle before being able to stand tall in the world. In the past hundred years, we have not been destroyed by the great powers' division, nor by the brutal Japanese invasion, and we are still unable to extricate ourselves from the suppression of chaos. This ancient country, the suffering people, do not know what kind of situation they will fall into.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I am heartbroken but not disheartened, disappointed but still hopeful for the future. We are people with limited resources and want to plan: (1) Expand the Bethany Orphanage. (2) Establish war memorial elementary and middle schools. (3) Establish a home for the elderly. (4) Establish an orphanage clinic or hospital. (5) A church. (6) An orchard. (7) Workshops and livestock farms, etc. Pastor Qian Tuan Yun is a person who handles affairs with the spirit of Christ. Where there's a will, there's a way. We believe that we will surely get help from heaven and people and realize the possibility of success.</p>
<p>Life is a journey in reverse, wealth is floating clouds. Looking at the world, one or two catastrophes are still not enough to awaken people's hearts! People's hearts are dangerous, crises are everywhere. In these short ten years, our country and people have tasted both foreign troubles and internal worries, and now they are still circulating endlessly, unable to solve the crisis and calm people's hearts, but children are always innocent! All of you gentlemen, it seems that you have to calm down and quietly think about: How will we account for this group of suffering next generation? We sincerely wish that social parents will take on the responsibility of education and nurturing, and jointly create good people for the next generation!</p>
<p>Seeking Adoption: A woman named Lu Zhang gave birth in our hospital last month and gave birth to a boy who is lively and well-proportioned. Due to extreme poverty, she is unable to raise him. She has no choice but to seek adoption by benevolent people. We have long admired your column's enthusiastic service, and we hope you will provide a small space to solicit adoption on her behalf. If there are sincere foster parents, please come to see Dr. Xi at Kang Hospital, 542 West Saixing Road, Zhabei (at the intersection of Qingyun Road).</p>
<p>Seeking Shen Bao: Mr. Deng Guyun from Yiyang, Hunan, is a long-time reader of our newspaper and has treasured our newspaper for many years. He is now missing the January 10, 1948, issue of our newspaper. We are seeking it on his behalf. If any readers in other places are willing to part with it, please send it to Mr. Deng via Taohuaji Post Office, Yiyang, for his benefit!</p>

<h3 id="e126">Stabilizing Prices Starts with Stabilizing People's Hearts <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Although everyone agrees that the price problem is extremely serious, for many people, as a certain newspaper in Beiping said, "Let it rise, those waiting to die are no longer afraid of death!" It has lost its stimulating effect. Because all the stimulating words that can be quoted in the dictionary have long been used in the price problem, such as "soaring," "sharply rising," "skyrocketing," "rising sharply," "full red," "triple jump," and so on, newspapers have almost written about it every day for the past ten years, and everyone has long regarded it as a matter of course psychologically. In the past, when people talked about the German mark, they could not help but think it was incredible, but now, everyone is already "not paying attention" to billions of numbers.</p>
<p>Moreover, those who are not afraid of death are not limited to the majority of "those waiting to die" who are already in a desperate situation; the reason why "those waiting to die" are not afraid of death is not really because they regard death as home, but simply because the general trend is such that they have to be sacrificed, so they have already developed a "waiting to die" preparation psychologically. Although they are still struggling on the edge of life and death, they are no longer stimulated or afraid of any conditions that could lead to rapid death.</p>
<p>However, there is another group of people who are not afraid of death, but their position is completely different from the "those waiting to die" mentioned above. The reason why "those waiting to die" are not afraid of death is simply a desperate situation for the weak and the sacrificed. Some of these people with stronger personalities fall into the category of taking risks, and some of the weaker ones fall into the category of suicide. The rest can all be classified as "those waiting to die"; however, they are all just the weak and the sacrificed in the overall environment.</p>
<p>And another group of people who are not afraid of death are not really not afraid of death, but are fearless because they have something to rely on. The life philosophy of this group of people is "The biggest lawsuit can be settled with enough money." They are as immune to all warnings or intimidating remarks as "those waiting to die" are to words like "rise, rise, rise." Based on their experience over the past ten years, they already know that the methods you can come up with are just that. Moreover, the more so-called methods you have, the more opportunities they have to profit from them. You say you want to "show them some color," they give you a "limit up" answer; you warn them "choose money over life, choose life over money," they give you a "full red"!</p>
<p>This is not just my personal prejudice, but facts that are right in front of our eyes. But who can you blame for all this? Blame the speculators? If you and I had the opportunity to speculate, I am afraid no one would be willing to fall behind. Look at the maids and elder sisters are doing "arbitrage" or hoarding boxes of soap! Do you blame the government? The government has promulgated economic laws to sanction speculation and hoarding more than the hairs on an ox. If someone could compile all the economic laws that have been promulgated and implemented since the War of Resistance, then I dare say that all the economic measures that have been implemented by various countries during extraordinary periods have been included. And what works for others, here, is all just a formality.</p>
<p>Some moralists believe that the reason why all good methods cannot achieve good results in our country is because our national morality is declining, and the people lack a sense of moral responsibility to society and the country. This cannot be denied as a part of the reason. However, morality is not something that can arise out of thin air; the foundation of morality is people's judgment of right and wrong. If society does not distinguish between right and wrong, and the administration only cares about the interests of a small number of people, and still asks the majority of people to bear the responsibility of morality to the country and society, it cannot but be said to be demanding. A member of the Legislative Yuan once said that we are using the money and lives of the poor to fight a war for the rich. Although the words may be a bit exaggerated, the fact that hot money is pouring into the south and the rich are concentrating in big cities cannot be denied after all.</p>
<p>In fact, even fighting a war for the rich cannot be said to be an unspeakable thing, because protecting private wealth in normal capitalist countries is also equivalent to protecting social wealth at the same time. The only condition is that these private wealth can indeed be used for the country in times of national crisis. Britain and the United States are typical capitalist countries in the world. In the two world wars, their rich people also profited immensely, but they would eventually invest their capital back into the country. Because although they also have poor people, it is impossible for them to ask the poor to sell their lives completely. The relatively universal improvement of the living standards of the British and American people after the war is a powerful proof. (Especially in Britain, the nationalization of important enterprises and the rise of civilian forces after the war further prove that their war was indeed a national war.)</p>
<p>In our country, although there was a period in the early days of the War of Resistance when everyone contributed money and effort, it is no longer the case today. The rich are not only unwilling to contribute a single penny, but are also endlessly greedy. The fact that special relief donations have not been accounted for to this day, and that the price increases continue unabated, has completely exposed the faces of these wealthy people. Conversely, those who still had the strength to contribute in the beginning, even if they are now powerless, must still contribute. The land tax and miscellaneous levies imposed everywhere all fall on these poor worms!</p>
<p>With such a social phenomenon, how can we talk about right and wrong and morality in vain? "Those waiting to die" are no longer afraid of death, and those who seek good fortune are not immune to death. Although the positions of the two are different, the overall performance of society has reached a desperate situation. If the country's policies cannot address this situation and make fundamental reforms quickly, then all piecemeal economic and price policies will probably never have any effect other than to provide speculators with capital to profit from shorting and longing. The current price problem is no longer a simple economic problem, but a problem of people's hearts. Therefore, effective price countermeasures should focus on making the people feel at peace. To put it bluntly, it should focus on "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality."</p>
<h3 id="e127">A School with Novelty <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 調鸚 (Tune Parrot)</p>
<p>"One can learn until old age, yet never finish learning."</p>
<p>This saying rings especially true today, because there are so many kinds of schools, and the subjects taught are diverse and fascinating. For example, in Los Angeles, USA, you can find a specialized school for almost any strange thing you want to learn.</p>
<p>There is one school that specializes in teaching people how to whistle. The person in charge of this school is a woman named Stockwell, and she has over twenty years of experience teaching whistling. Most of her students are also learning to sing, but sometimes traffic police officers and Boy Scout leaders also come to take classes; in addition, there are many people who come specifically to learn how to call dogs.</p>
<p>There is also a school that specializes in teaching people how to mix cocktails. More than five thousand students have graduated from this school. The course requires four weeks to complete, but some talented students only need ten days, while others can't learn even after eight weeks, and have to angrily drop out. The school's teaching plan includes a fifty-foot-long bar. The students use water dyed with different colors as various liquors to mix cocktails. Everyone stands behind the bar and carefully pours the colored water back and forth, with two instructors enthusiastically guiding them from the side.</p>
<p>Los Angeles also has an "Astrology School," which specializes in teaching students the incredibly profound "knowledge" of divination and fortune-telling. Depending on their talent, students must study for two to ten years. Graduates also receive diplomas, but what exactly is taught in the school? Outsiders don't know.</p>
<p>The "Astrology School's" phone is very busy. Gamblers who buy horse racing tickets often call to ask which horse will win, and young couples who are about to become parents often anxiously ask whether they will have a son or a daughter.</p>
<p>If you can't remember your friends' and relatives' phone numbers, you should apply to go to Los Angeles at your own expense to attend a memory school. It is said that many people in American politics and business attend this school; there are also actors who can't remember their lines and medical students who don't understand orthopedic terminology who go to this school for special training.</p>
<p>In addition, two forward-looking female educators in Los Angeles have opened a home economics school that specializes in teaching girls how to be virtuous housewives. The school is very successful, and enrollment is very enthusiastic, especially among girls who are about to get married. Recently, a girl who was almost frantic with anxiety came to the home economics school and said with tears in her eyes that she had been bragging to her boyfriend during a conversation, saying that she was a good cook. Her boyfriend was overjoyed and told her that he would definitely come to her house for dinner—but she had never cooked before, what should she do?</p>
<p>The kind instructors at the home economics school sympathized with her greatly and set up a "super-speed course" for her, enabling her to learn how to cook three delicious dishes in two hours.</p>

<p>An unprecedented athletic feat in history was the "cross-country long run" of Monson Estoft of Norway in 1832. He ran a round trip from Constantinople to Calcutta, covering 5,625 miles in 59 days, averaging 90 li (approximately 45 km) every 40 hours. The success of this feat was very difficult, because when Enstoff passed through Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, India and other places, he had to swim across several rivers and climb over several mountains and deserts.</p>
<p>One day in 1899, the Paris edition of the New York Herald published a question and answer about the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit thermometers. Because of someone's carelessness, it was published again in the same position the next day. This made the newspaper owner J. G. Bennett extremely angry. He ordered that this article be published every day for the rest of his life. Before Mr. Bennett's death in 1918, this famous letter was published more than 6,700 times.</p>
<p>Mrs. New Naidaf Shue of Moscow had 69 children between 1820 and 1855, including sixteen sets of twins, seven sets of triplets, and four sets of quadruplets. The original documents are preserved in the Leningrad Academy of Sciences and the French Academy of Sciences in Paris.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Annoying <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 翼君 (Yi Jun)</p>
<p>In life, even if you can't become a "magnetic personality" who pleases everyone, you should at least not become an "insensitive fellow" who often annoys people.</p>
<p>I'm not clear on what a "magnetic personality" is, and I can't say I please everyone, but I really want to be a little more "sensitive" and not annoy people.</p>
<p>I think two things are the most "annoying": borrowing money and seeking employment.</p>
<p>What's the deal with borrowing money? It's taking other people's money and using it for yourself. But you need money, and other people need money too. Why should others give you their money to use? Stepping back, even if others have a lot of money and don't need it themselves, lending it to you is always a troublesome thing. They have to worry about you not being able to pay it back, and they're also afraid that robbers will find out that they are rich. Furthermore, prices are rising every day, every hour. When they lend you one million, when you pay it back (assuming only a day has passed), it may only be worth five hundred thousand. Who would be happy with a loss-making business? I understand this principle very well, so I've made up my mind not to borrow money from others unless absolutely necessary. In 9,999 out of 10,000 cases, I won't borrow.</p>
<p>Asking people for employment is also a very troubling thing. All institutions are now downsizing and laying off people. Where are there any "jobs"? Fortunately, there is a "vacancy," but you ask for it, and he asks for it, who should get it? You say you are recommended by the department head, but others are also recommended by the ministry secretary; you say you are enthusiastic in your service, but others have also shown good results in the past; you say you have good academic qualifications, but others have also passed some exams. Half a catty, eight taels, 6.7 pounds on the decimal scale, everyone is about the same. There are too few positions for too many people, so who should get it? You are afraid of offending you, afraid of being blamed by him, and afraid of making enemies with someone with a "big background." Isn't this kind of thing annoying? Although I know this principle, I can't be "sensitive" and not "ask" people, because I have already graduated and have to trouble people.</p>
<p>In the current social environment, even if you want to be a person who is not annoying, it is not an easy thing. Being a person is difficult!</p>
<h3 id="e130">Ramblings on the Lugou Bridge <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 老丹 (Lao Dan)</p>
<p>The ominous day of the "July 7th" anniversary has arrived again. The place name most closely related to "July 7th" is "Lugou Bridge." Because of the Japanese warlords' invasion with a cannon shot at Lugou Bridge south of Wanping City on July 7th of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937], the three words Lugou Bridge spread around the world along with the smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The name Lugou Bridge comes from the fact that the bridge is built on the Lugou River. The river water is turbid, so it is also known as the Hun River (Muddy River). Zhou Hui's "Northern Yuan Records" says of it: "The Lugou River is also called the Black Water River, its color is the most turbid, and its flow is as swift as an arrow." From this point of view, the so-called "Lugou" refers to the color of the water, and has absolutely nothing to do with reeds. The character "Lu" [盧] originally does not have the grass radical. The memorial archway on the east side of the bridge is inscribed with the four characters "Lugou Xiaoyue" (Lugou at Dawn), and there is also no grass radical. However, for more than ten years, in general public and private writings, people have mistakenly transmitted and written the character "Lu" [盧] as "Lu" [蘆 - reed], and have become accustomed to what is wrong. This should be corrected.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the bridge, the "Jin History: River Works" states that it was built in the twenty-ninth year of Dading [1189]. It was repaired once during the ninth year of the Zhengtong period of the Ming Dynasty [1444]. The bridge is 660 feet long from east to west, has ten arches, and is 26 feet wide. There are a total of 281 stone lions on the bridge railings, each with a different posture, and the carvings are very detailed, magnificent and spectacular. The original name of the bridge was Guangli Bridge. Marco Polo's "Travels" calls it "Pulisanqian" (because the Lugou River is also known as the Sanggan River), but Europeans call it "Marco Polo Bridge."</p>
<p>Before the railway was built, the Lugou Bridge was a necessary route from the south to Beiping (Beijing). After the railway was completed, the junction of the BeiNing (Beijing-Nanjing), PingHan (Beijing-Hankou), and PingSui (Beijing-Suiyuan) railways was also located here. The Japanese warlords launched a large-scale war of aggression, and set fire to Lugou Bridge first, and their conspiracy and ambition can be known.</p>
<p>According to recent arrivals from the north, on January 7th, the third arch of the bridge on the north end has been collapsed by overloaded trucks of the Beijing Shengji Automobile Company. Because the repair work is extremely difficult, there is no plan for repair at the moment. Sadly, the historical and famous building that once strongly shocked the hearts of every Chinese person has been damaged, just like the fragmented national territory.</p>
