<h3>總統咨文獲立院同意　翁文灝受命長政院　各部會首長今大致可定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕蔣總統廿四日午後向立法院提出徵請同意行政院長人選之咨文，係由第一局局長許靜芝親自送往立院，全文如次：</p>
<p>總統咨統（一）字第一號三十七年五月廿四日</p>
<p>茲擬以翁文灝爲行政院院長。查翁君爲國際著名學者，曾任國民政府委員，行政院副院長等職，對於中外情形，夙稱通達，尤以十餘年來歷應軍事委員會第三部，經濟部，戰時生產局及資源委員會首長，凡關經濟建設以及充實國防資源等工作，久瘁心力，不彰績效，而於國際聯繫暨敎育。文化諸要端並多建樹。當此行憲伊始，內而戡亂建國，外而接應美援，任重事繁，端資通才，以之提任行政院長，深信必能勝任愉快，爰依憲扑第五十五條第一項之規定，咨詢同意，以便任命，此咨立法院，總統蔣中正。（圖爲翁文灝近影）</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕蔣總統廿四日咨文立法院，提請同意翁文灝任行政院長。立院當於廿四日下午舉行第一會期第三次會議，首次行使其同意權，會中依法推吳鐵城爲主席，改開全院會議，進行審查討論，並對「咨請總統通知翁氏提出施政意見」一點，以三八八人多數之贊成，通過無此必要。旋立院續開第三次會，舉行無記名投票，表決結果，以四八九票之多數，鄭重同意翁文灝任行政院長。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕翁文灝廿四日接受行憲後行政院第一任院長之任命，即晚開始進行組閣工作。翁氏于立院通過同意渠出任院長後表示，此次倉卒受命，一切均尙未着手準備，須向總統請示，並與各方接洽後，始能有所決定。翁氏旋于晚九時奉總統召赴官邸晋謁，就新政院副院長以下各部曾首長及政務委員，正副秘書長人選及施政方針有所請示。翁氏任行政院長之命令，總統將於廿五日頒布，其他人選正分別治商，廿五日可望大致決定。據悉：靑年·民社兩黨仍將在行政院中獲有部長及政務委員，社會賢達亦將有數人參加，俾共同執政，完成行憲建國工作。另悉：翁氏已定廿五日下午四時半在資委會舉行記者招待會，就人事及施政兩項有所報吿。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕孫科，陳立夫廿四日電賀翁文灝出任行憲首任行政院長。</p>
<p>立法院咨復總統　請翁氏就任後提施政方針</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立法院對行政院長任命行使同意權之經過及結果，已於廿四日夜咨復蔣總統，是項咨文係由立院秘書處長　光朗，於下午十時半親訪總統府第一局局長許　芝送致，咨文中首說明該院依憲法第五十五條第一次行使同意權，於接獲總統咨文後，即付全院委員會議審查，認爲任命翁文灝氏爲行政院長一事，可予同意，復經第三次會議決議通過同意。此外，並附帶叙述各委員於全院委員會議中審查意見之大要，請總統轉吿翁氏，於就任行政院長後，向立院提出施政方針之報告。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立院答復同意翁文灝出任行政院長一事之咨文，送達總統府後，蔣總統富以任命令三件交付翁氏副署，並即於深夜發出：（一）特任翁文灝爲行政院院長，（二）特任吳鼎昌爲總統府秘書長，（三）特任薛岳爲總統府參軍長，其中任命翁氏之命令，亦經由其本人副署，蓋依憲法行政院長經總統提名及立法院同意後，即已得合法之資格，而總統之任何命令，則必須　行政院長之副署也。</p>
<h3>立院審查表決經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕立院第一會期第三次會議，廿四日下午三時五十分舉行，孫科院長主席，通過第二次會議紀錄後，孫主席即命秘審處宣讀蔣總統擬以翁文　爲行政院院長，依憲法第五十五條第一項之規定，提請同意之統（一）字第一號咨文，會衆聆畢，即鼓掌表示歡迎。旋孫主席宣稱：依議事規則第八章同意權之行使第五十三條之規定：「依憲法第五十五條行使同意權時，應由全院委員會議審查後，提出本院會議投票，前項全院委員會議，由委員互推一人爲主席，以之徵詢會衆同意，並主持會議進行。</p>
<p>全院會議審查討論</p>
<p>旋公推吳鐵城爲主席。孫氏即偕正副秘書長張肇元，延國符退席，而由吳氏主席，改開全院委員會議。祁志厚首先發言，主張予以同意，渠謂：翁文灝氏在國際學術界負盛譽，在國內政壇上無派系，爲目前行政院長適當人選，唯望能引用新人，以行新政。田雨時繼亦以翁氏爲淸廉有爲之科學政治家，應搜立院同意，但於同意之先，亦應反映民意。渠謂：翁氏雖具備甚優之條件，但其過去政績並非十全十美，故對其以後施政期望三事：（一）要組織超然自中進步之新閣，執行政務，（二）須組成人才內閣，對舊政院之部會首長，應分別汰留，勿須顧及派系，但宜注意各地區人才之延引分配，（三）應注意國家人民之需要，樹立政策，以快刀斬亂麻之魄力，消除攤瘓現象。田氏最後並主張省去議事規則第八章第五十四條所規定「如認爲必要，得由本院咨請總統通知所提人提出施政意見」之程序。王劍鍔稱：渠對翁氏不甚了了，但爲目前局勢計，擁護總統意見，渠盼新政院能（一）淸除高官大員之橫行貪汚，（二）裁除駢枝機關。旋張金鑑指出，總統咨文上介紹翁氏之材料，不足了解其政策，主張請總統通知翁氏提出施政意見，渠謂：過去政事之壞，在於主政者各方敷衍得好，而其揹施則背離國策。翁氏固廣有人緣，且極　潔，然應能令其僚屬亦不貪汚，且翁氏爲飽受資本主義，自由主義敎育者，能否確切實行民生主義，節制資本，造福全民、均須由其施政童見提供擔保，否則立院如毫無根據，率爾予以同意，實有愧職守。馬乘風亦稱：依翁氏過去作風觀之除非有新辦法，不能令人確信渠可打開目前困難局面，其新辦法如何，應先予立院看看，方可信任同意。胡健中，程滄波兩氏對此意見相繼表示反對，以爲施政意見並無必要，於同意之先提出，但立院意見應請其注意。胡氏並稱：目前要務，殆爲戡亂剿匪與充裕民生兩端，翁氏前爲經濟部長任內，僅對重工業有興趣，但民生工業殊乏建樹。在資委會委長任內，對僚屬約束亦復欠週，故非行政院長之最理想人選然爲政治之穩定亦可求次同意此一廉能之學者。程氏則於說明主政者不必爲奇才異人，而在其政策之有無，後述其　在歐美聆聽國際友人對我國之關心，集中兩點：其一爲共匪問題，其二爲並貨膨脹，換言之即軍事與財政兩事，故認爲翁氏之施政措施，應以軍需軍訓及財富重分配爲三重心。潘朝英則指出，新政院必將顚簸不定之騎牆外交政策予以終止，至四時四十分，會衆要求終止審查討論，吳主席乃以議事規則第八章第五十四條規定關於咨請總統通知翁氏提出施政意見有無必要一題，徵詢會衆意見，各委員意見不一，經表決後，始以三八八人之多數贊成（出席委員五八七人）通過無此必要。四時五十分全院委員會議乃告結束，休息。</p>
<p>第三次會投票表決</p>
<p>五時廿分續開第三次會議，吳鐵城報告全院委員會議對總統所提行政院長人選審查情形後，孫主席宣布，依議事規則第八章第五十六條規定，舉行無記名投票，以議決是否同意翁文灝爲行政院長，經指定王啓江，鄧鴻業，范予遂，楊玉淸等十二人任監察員，於五時半開始投票，各委員魚貫登主席台簽字領票，圈定印就之同意或不同意字樣後，投入票匣，半小時投票即吿完畢，孫主席報吿監察負領票六八零張，發出六零五張，，剩餘空白票七十五張，旋進行開票，于監察員之監視下，歷十分鐘計數完畢，六時十五分孫主席報吿開票結果，總計投入票匭者爲六零三張，除廢票廿張外，有效票爲五八三張，其中同意票四八九張，不同意票九十四張，「本院鄭重同意翁文灝先生任行政院長」，六時廿分散會。</p>
<h3>首屆監院六一集會　籌委會電各監委準備出席</h3>
<p>〔中決社南京廿四日電〕首屆監察院將於六月一日集會，此孫總統於今日提出新行政院長所決定者，惟正式集會，將俟新任行政院長發表後依法頒布。監院籌備委會於接獲總統府通知後，刻已分電各省市監委選舉事務所轉知當選監委，預爲準備，傳得如期來京出席。據籌委會負責人今談稱，監委之報到，一俟召集令公布即可開始，監委來程旅費及招待費，一切均照立委報到成例辦理，據最近統計，目前業已在京京之新監委計有居正，丁惟汾，鄒魯，劉新等六十餘人。按監委總額爲二二三人，業經選出者一六八人，已超過總額三分之二，依憲法實施之準備程序規定，已得爲合法之集會及召集。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國民黨蔣總裁爲提名翁文灝出任行政院長問題，廿四日下午二時在中央黨部約集國民黨籍立委舉行談話會，出席立委二百餘人，蔣總裁於二時四十分蒞會致詞，說明提名翁氏之理由。總裁指出，翁氏爲一知名學者，具國際州馨譽，主持經濟建設事業有年，頗多貢獻，且曾任行政院副院長，富有行政經騐，從政以來，未嘗參與派系，其爲人廉潔自持，海內共聞，過去各方輿論多指摘政府之貪汚無能，現以一名科學家及淸廉之士出長政院，庶可轉移官場風氣及國際視聽。當此行憲伊始，翁氏殆爲一比較適宜之人選，總裁並諄諄囑以値此時艱，行政梡長一職不客久懸，必須迅速決定提名，獲得立院同意，組織新行政院，執行政務，因盼各委員體念斯旨，予以支持。總裁致詞歷十分鐘，詞意懇切，各立委無不動容，旋周雍能，孔庚，劉健羣等相繼發言，認爲翁氏之學識精湛，　　　富，出任行政院長，必能聯任愉快，當表示仰證總裁意旨，決予支持，全體委員一致鼓掌同意，至下午三時十分散會。</p>
<h3>曾琦徐傅霖發表意見</h3>
<p>認翁文灝適合長政院</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕民社黨徐傅黨廿四日晚對總統提名翁文灝爲政院長一事，表示甚爲適合。徐氏認爲翁氏富學識，作事精細，在國民黨中爲一不可多得之人才。關於民社黨參加行政院問題，徐氏表示尚未考慮，因立院問題尚未解決也。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕中國青年黨領袖會琦，發表談話，略謂：「翁文灝氏組閣，予甚欣慰，第一，因其為純粹學者，平日態度甚為公正，必能容納衆流，擴大政府基礎。第二，因其對于建設事業過去曾著成績，必能善用美援，為大規模之建設，以對付共產黨無限制的破壞，蔣總統之提出翁氏，與立法院之欣然同意，皆為明智之舉，吾人將拭目以觀。翁氏之「新政策」與「新陣容」　因人民望治之殷，實有不容再　之勢，行憲有如「壓軸戯」，翁氏必有以饜觀衆之望」。</p>
<h3>總統出席紀念週　陳雪屏氏報告學潮經過</h3>

<p>（一）關於外匯方面，政府回採取管制政策，過去平衡基金委員會所推行之工作，頗收成效，今後仍當遵循國策針對事實因事制宜，如須改善者，本人當儘量虛心接受，而加以檢討。（二）平抑物價方面，自當標本兼施，例如抽緊銀根，拋售物資等，此外政府確已擬其新的有效方法，即予實行。（三）東北流通券最初係適應需要，繼乃採納東北人民意見，予以停止，幷予收兌。其收兌辦法，業經政院通過，幷已將準備兌換之法幣，運出關外，着手兌換，其主旨在求東北金融及其人民心理之安定。（四）短期國庫券發行不久，亦有相當成效，如地方金融人士供獻良好意見，自當採納，而加改進。（五）關於人事問題，國家人才應爲國家服務，中央銀行係業務機構，尤不宜因主持人不同而有所牽動，故本行人事，並無變更。</p>
<h3>俞氏與吳長商談物價</h3>
<p>央行人事大致不動</p>
<p>招待會完畢後，兪氏復與吳市長國楨商平抑物價問題。旋兪氏又接見劉副總裁攻芸，垂詢該行業務及人事，至十二時半乃離行返寓。下午三時兪氏復至行辦公，並接見市警察局長兪叔平等。</p>
<p>另據本報記者所悉：關于未來央行人事，據聞劉副總裁攻芸，已打銷辭意，業務局主管一職，將來可能有變動。又平準會主委陳光甫，遠在張嘉璈未辭職前，已有去志，將來主委一職，傳聞將由徐柏園担任。至於國行將來之政策，除管制金融市塲及穩定物價等工作，將依原定辦法進行外，其餘金融大計及運用美援等方案之規劃，須俟新閣成立後，始能有最後決定。</p>

<h3>對新閣前途的期望</h3>
<p>難產的行政院長，終於昨日由總統提名经立法院同意產生了，負組閣大任的是翁文灝氏。翁氏在戰前早爲學術界知名之士，參議政府，負開發資源之實，在抗織期間，主掌經濟部及戰時生產局，抗戰勝利後，會任行政院副院長，現任資源委員會委員長。翁氏在一般人心目中，當然是一位有抱負，有遠見，能有所作爲的人物。翁氏固爲國民黨的中央委員，而就其學者風度來說，自可許爲自由主議者，與社會賢達無殊。此在人民喁喁望治的今日，由翁文灝氏出任艱鉅，組織在憲法之下的一個負聯帶責任的行政院，實行新政，宜可孚中外人士的衆望</p>
<p>新任行政院長是我國行憲後的第一任行政院長，依照憲法的規定，須由總統提名經立法院同意任命之，所以總統對於行政院長人選的提名，考意再三。聽說總統初屬意張羣院長，而張院長鑒於全國人心渴望用新人行新政的迫切，不願蟬聯，甚至離京飛渝，以示堅決。總統嗣屬意甫自國外歸來之何應欽將軍，乃何將軍又以「離國近兩年，對於國內政情，不巷明瞭」爲理由，不願肩此重任，力辭大命。因此，行政院長人選一時未能決定，總統乃利用星期例假，作竟日的考慮，最後始決定以組織大命授與翁文灝氏，昨日翁氏之提名，聞先提請國民黨中常會公決，當經通過；至午後始正式咨文立法院，亦經該院第三次會議以四八九對九四票予以通過。我們觀於行政院長產生的艱難，再觀於新被提名的翁氏的道德文章才器見識，我們除了爲我國民主憲政前途深慶得人而外，並願乘翁院長着手組閣之際，提出若干意見，以表示我們對於今後政局的願望。</p>
<p>第一，責任內閣制的精義，在於政策之貫澈，而政策之能貫澈與否，先須問是否有政策，次須問政策是否得人民代表之同意，然後再問政策執行後之成果如何。故翁氏奉命組閣而後，先要準備他的施政方針。我們以爲今後的施政方針，切忌徒唱高調，而應實事求是。我國憲法內有基本國策一章，對於國防，外交，國民經濟，社會安全，文化敎育，暨邊疆政策，都已有原則的規定，故目前所需要的，輿其說是一篇空洞的文章，毋寗是針對時弊的切實辦法，以及力行這些辦法的決心而已。我們以爲在今日情形之下，誠如某權威人十所談，有兩項重大政策必須立即執行，一是戡亂軍事的迅速推行，俾於最短期問完成戡亂任務，二爲經濟措施的切實有效，例如美援如何整用，金融如何穩定，國計民生又如何設法加以改善，都應該是絞腦汁去思考，下決心去實行的。老實說，今日全國人民，都生活在水深火熱之中，差不多連一口氣也喘不過來，而兩月以來，政務鬆弛，形同停頓，共匪反乘機擴大騷亂，狼奔豕突，若新政府猶不趕快組成，挺起眉膀來担當大任，如何再好敎人民活得下去？「渴者易為飲，飢者易爲食，在今日民不聊生之際，只要政府愛民保民，爲人民解倒懸，其實並不是一個不能解決的難題。所貴乎有學者風度的領導人物，先改造成一種「負責」的新政風來。從行政院長本人起，一直到各部會首長，都要有新政治家的民主風度，不僅要虛懷若谷接受人民的批評，而且還要有從善如流的精神，負起責任來幹。無論幹好幹壞，決不推諉責任，這是責任內閣最基本的要義。必須具有這種精神，政治才會革新，才會有進步。</p>
<p>第二，年來政局最使人感到奇異者，就是走馬燈式的政治人物，好像以中國之大，能爲國家盡忠効力者祇有這批角色。而他們的能力如何，政績如何，固已彰彰在人耳目。故今日旣以新人新政爲標榜，則選擇各部曾首長及不管部會之政務委員，應本「用人唯賢」的原則，摒除一切黨派門戶之見，而且要眞正「天下爲公」，不次超擢，才能發掘新人才。中外政論家評論我國政府歷次改組，往往說「換湯不換藥」，時至今日，若還不肯起用新人，使政府的面目一新，若還不肯選拔幾個年富力强有肝肌有見識的靑年政治家，使政府增添朝氣，則何能望政府成爲「有能」？戰後英國工黨組閣，起用大批新人，保持工黨政府的朝氣，實可供翁院畏選擇各部會首長的參攷。過去的行政院是對國府主席負責，同時也是國民黨與民靑兩黨所組織的聯合政府；但是行憲後的行政院，係對立法院負責的責任內閣，其所應注意的問題，與其說是政治性的問題，不如說應該是憲法上的問題。故不問翁院長是否仍欲延欖民靑兩黨人物參加行政院，但是他選擇何人入閣，出而担任何部會，均應重視其本人之才能，更應重視其本人的政見是否輿翁院長的施政方針相符合。換曾之，閣員人選，應問其才不才，不當問其黨不黨。我們相信唯有如此，才能組織一個「有能」的政府，才能符合國人殷切的期望。</p>
<p>第三，在戡亂軍事嚴重困難的今日，我人鄣需要一個強有力的政府，需要一個有高速度行政效率的政府，決不盼望產生一個軟弱無能的政府，一個敷衍塞責的政府。新行政院要忠於行憲，不論是內政外交的大計，都要依照這部憲法進行，而我們所嚴須注意的，也不是行政院與立法院的關係。依照憲法規定，立法院對於行政院的重要施政有立法權，同意權，質詢權；行政院對於立法院負責，僅有交還覆議權。　權相較，顯不能奏「制衡」（Check　and　Balance）之效。行政院所受的牽制旣多，所以許多人均視行政院長爲畏途。但是我們研究中國憲法的立法精神，其要旨當在權能劃分，人民要有充分的權，政府要有充分的能。如果只斤斤於字面的解釋，行政院事事要求立法院的同意，行政院自院長以下，人人祇知敷衍立法院，抱定「多做多錯，少做少錯，不做不錯」的想法，大家泄泄沓沓，糊塗過日，則政府必形成癱瘓無能的政府。否則初雖勉强上台，不久又將知難而退。行政院長若果經常更迭，不僅政局不能安定，而且任何政策也不能貫澈。此種政制，決非我們人民所期望的。所以我們要行政與立法兩院雙方朋瞭我國憲法的精神，行政院必須重視其政策，以强毅的精神來執行政策，立法院也祗能以政策課行政院的責任，而不時時刻刻在小處掣行政當局之肘。必如此，始可望今後的政府逐漸成爲一個具有高度效率的强有力的政府。</p>

<h3>以色列令猶軍停止射擊後　阿軍仍拒絕休戰　倫敦英美會商今後對策　我昐聯合國促聖地停戰能全面履行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：英外部發曾人稱：英政府決盡其可能，力促阿拉伯方面接受巴勒斯邊休戰。同時英美大使在開羅亦與埃外長接觸頻繁。阿拉伯方面認爲：阿拉伯可接受停戰建議，但安理會必須保證解除猶人之武裝並取消分治計劃。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕美駐英大使陶格拉斯今再訪貝文外相，討論巴勒斯坦問題，談一小時許。是爲四十八小時中陶氏之第二次訪晤貝文。關係方面相信，所談殆爲阿拉伯國拒絕聯合國停戰令後，所將採取之政策。</p>

<p>〔中央社成功湖廿三日合衆電〕以色列國突然頒佈之停火令，使阿拉伯國家本日晚　在聯合國中地位頗窘。美代表團發言人謂：渠對於以色列宣佈倘阿拉伯亦如此，則猶方將停火一舉至爲欣慰。此間人士一致認爲以色冽之宣佈停火，實乃一高妙之外交策略。聯合國刻等待阿方之反應，如彼等不顧安理會之命令而在停火限期後，繼續作戰，則可能遭受安理會之經濟或軍事制裁。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿四日電〕安全理事會定於廿四日下午六時三十分（格林威治標準時間）舉行會議，如情勢需要，則討論巴勒斯坦問題，如巴勒斯坦問題時需採取訊速行動，則安理會將討論捷克政變案。</p>

<h3>英海外駐軍額有增無減　防務計劃改舊觀　英在中東地位頗感困難</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教廿三日電〕此間軍事觀察家稱，一九四七及一九四八年英軍之自印緬及巴勒斯坦撤退，雖將深刻影響英國在全世界之戰略，然英國之整個軍事責任，並不因此减少。縮减軍員之目標仍爲七十萬人，海外駐軍亦不致大批返國。國防大臣亞歷山大於去歲十月吿化院，謂當時之軍員總額九十四萬名，於十二個月後將减少廿二萬四千名，减少者均爲戰後例有之復員，非特不减少長備兵名額，且使常備名額略增。亞歷山大當時並曰英國全部兵員約有三分之一駐在海外，此項比例今仍不變，故若承平時期兵員總額爲七十萬名，駐在海外之陸海空軍人員約爲廿二萬名，較戰前之海外駐軍額反大見增加。就戰略上言，雖因若干殖民地之獨立而變更英在海外軍略之性質，然其範圍並不縮小，此蓋由於戰後世界局勢不穩之故。英防務重心目前在中東西歐及通至各自洽領之海上交通綫。印細及巴基斯坦之防務已不復由英國直接控制，在未來戰爭中，英國祗能以政治方法，取得印度洋海岸之佈防權，或使印細助英方作戰或嚴守中立。英國在中東之地位亦頗困難，巴勒斯坦之放棄，使其失去中東一主要基地，蘇葬士運河區能否確保尙待視英埃談判之結果而定。因此英國在中東之未來地位及其油源供應綫，端賴英國之鞏固其與阿拉伯國之友好同盟條約，以及設在阿拉伯國附近之若干新基地，如馬爾太，塞浦魯斯，東非坎雅等。東非之基地尚在興建之中，其地位適中，居東西及中東之中心，堪為任何鉗形戰術之基地。在歐洲方面，西歐聯盟之成立，自使英國在歐之軍事責任較戰前為增，由於英防務制度之集中在歐洲及中東，自治領之防務勢必逐漸卸於自治領本身，然於發生大戰之時，自治領勢難自抗强敵，英帝國參謀總長　帥去歲訪問各治領時，殆已擬具英共和邦之共同防衛計劃。</p>
<h3>英國各自治領　慶祝帝國節　表示對祖國効忠</h3>

<h3>土耳其決與美加強合作　維護東地中海各平　希望聖地問題獲公正解決</h3>
<p>〔路透社安加拉廿三日電〕土耳其外長薩達克今日在西伐斯之政黨會議中發表演說，强調美國與土耳其維護東地中海區和平的共同努力，正逐漸增長中。美國深知大西洋之防務，實以東地由海爲起點，美國加强土耳其之防籞力量之維護和平之努力，尙在繼續中，希望今後能繼續此項援助。</p>
<p>土國本身今以其有限資源之一半致力於國防，以爲自由及獨立之最確切保障，外傳美援有損土國獨立之說，確無其事，薩氏又曰，最近美國向莫斯科建議討論異見之解決，顯見美國對蘇並無侵略意向。美政府會向土保證，其向蘇聯建議討論雙方歧見，絕非表示美國在地中海及中東之政策將有變更。薩氏復曰，一吾人不得不承認巴勒斯坦局勢之劇變，業已妨碍中東和平與安定的建立。吾人切盼流血不再繼續，亦不致成立動亂與不安的永久因素，以獲致持久的解決辦法，使阿拉伯族得爲其權利之主人。土耳其之政策爲和平，土國永遠準備與我思想相同宗旨相同之各國，建立最友好的關係及合作。但如涉及土國本身之自由及獨立，則土國將絕不同意苟且」云。</p>

<p>內銷茶晨初尚平，嗣後一致迂迥帶俏，且陳特祁門，續再猛力疾晉，綠因米價及其他各物迭創高峯，特貨者乃圖堅售耳。交易僅本街尚有零星添納，是以依然寥若晨星。</p>
<h3>紗管標售棉花</h3>
<p>紗管會昨（廿四）日仍委託中紡公司，標　棉花三種，共計二千四百五十擔。其中通州粗花九百擔，售價三千二百六十萬，漢口粗花三百五十擔，售價三千〇二十萬，火機花一千二百擔，售價三千一百萬。</p>
<h3>棉紗喊價挺升　布疋銷路不旺</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因銀根鬆弛，同業頭寸寬裕，進出頻繁，客帮吸納亦強。市勢以去化吒盛，雖有紡建再度懸牌標售，依然挺俏。</p>
<p>四十二支籃鳳細紗，晨開比上週末即升五百萬，吸戶甚多。後以散戶哄抬，喊價迭升，步高至三億一千二百萬元收價，較週六續漲一千二百萬元。</p>
<p>二十一支雙馬紗，去化強健，再創二億四千萬元新高峰收束，續漲一千萬元。其餘支各粗細紗，亦均步升三四百萬至一千三五百萬不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開在利賣消息中，各帮咸抱觀望，本街實銷不動，客帮殊鮮活動，同業則對現貨套出颇多。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布開價躍上十三萬元，買戶淸稀，一度盤低。迨至臨收時，聞紗市上揚，轉蘇至七百萬零三萬收盤，比週六步升二十萬元，其餘各布市亦回穩。</p>
<h3>收購桐油價格　中信昨已調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信讬局昨日調整收購桐油價格，梧州上海區每擔收購提高爲一四五〇萬，廣州區每擔一五五〇萬。</p>
<h3>行局差進　暗息轉降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日當局仍致力於抽緊銀根，四行兩局一庫共差進一萬四千四百八十二億，惟其中九千餘億爲紗款。市塲銀根仍鬆暗息巳降至二角七分左右。又昨日各行局庫差進差出之數字如下：中央銀行差進四千八百五十一億，大交換差出六七六九億，外商銀行差進一七八五億，小交換差出九四九八億，中國銀行差進五八九八億，交通銀行差進一一一〇億，中農差出八一億，中信局差進二一七五億，郵匯局差出二三三億，中央合作金庫差進七六二億。</p>
<h3>錢荘小額貸款銀團　再度放寬最高限額</h3>

<h3>提高行荘資金</h3>
<p>戴銘禮表示三項原則</p>
<p>關於健全金融機構，提高行莊業質問題，自上次財部錢幣司長戴銘禮氏在滬宣佈財部已與全國經濟委員會商訂辦法中後，各界對此均表關切。金融管理局長李立俠氏於上週六且認爲行莊資金，至少須援高至五百億。頃記者再於戴銘體氏處獲悉：提高行莊素質，目前巳至具體階段。財都與全經會會商中之辦法，可能較現行之辦法彈性較強。聞是項辦法，目前已決定三項原則。即都市行莊資金，較內地爲高。銀行資金較錢莊爲高。戴氏幷表示今後行莊資金總額，就都市中言，即五百億元，似亦尚嫌過少。鄉村行莊則五百億左右，巳可應付目前需要云。</p>
<h3>呢羢現定均寂</h3>
<p>呢羢現貨賣買，還來續趨寂寞，因售價高漲，買戶袖手，夏貨銷路有减無增，秋冬貨市氣雖較秀，然有實力預購者，究屬無幾。至於定貨方面，舶來品早巳斷絕，本廠貨資本雄厚者均不肯定出。小廠家略有訂定，而定洋多欲收取七成以至十足，定戶因此，多感乏味。　造成現定均寂之局面。</p>
<h3>助賣消息甚多　華股過程呆滯</h3>
<p>華股昨以國行總裁就職，政院首長亦見端倪，不無戒懼。隨業外各物一致由高回落，過程呆滯，人心渙散，臨收更疲。</p>
<p>晨初一般心理鑒於政院首揆尚未決定，不無蠢動。永紗開高至三〇〇〇，更升至三〇六〇元高價。脫售者頗多，代辦費開原價，跌至三〇〇〇五元。惟是際人心尚好，再回升至三〇五〇元。此後即在斬多聲中，每况愈下。銀根略緊，小而離奇之助賣消息紛查，午收退至二九三〇元。較上過六計美亞景福火柴新光新華跌半成，華新信誼商務均平，餘均微降。</p>
<p>後市初開永紗爲二九六〇元，買戶觀望，退至二八八五元。國行差進不少，退至二八六五元低價。買賣雙方掙扎之下收市爲二八七〇元。較晨收計華新信館新光勤興火柴新華均平，餘均微挫。塲外各未上市股票穩健，銀行股最俏。</p>
<p>外股　昨亦先堅後疲，鋼業曾見一四五萬高價，尚屬買盤。怡紗晨開五五〇萬，自五五八萬起，退至五二〇萬結束。港電亦有報長，銀行帮散戶雖納，證券帮廣帮賣出。較上週六計怡紗英聯會德豐紙版墾植微，降業廣航業怡眸鋼業各跌半成。</p>
<p>公債　昨略穩定，成交約三百萬。統丙晨開二四萬，升至二六萬二，而後略回。較上週六計統丙漲起一萬元，甲乙丙丁各升四千元。</p>

<h3>二隻十二碼救了青白　英海軍先勝後敗　三比二青白死裏逃生</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英艦倫敦號與驚覺號之聯合足球隊昨日下午五時在逸園與靑白作友誼賽，青白在下半時憑着最後七分鐘二次十二碼球，以三比二後來居上，擊收英海軍隊，可謂死裏逃生，幸中之幸，上半時各得一球未分勝負。逸園觀衆約有二千人。</p>
<p>意外精彩</p>
<p>英海軍足球隊球迷一向無深刻印象，因缺乏強硬球隊，但昨日登塲一隊，踢來不錯，攻勢猛烈，靑白受窘很久，若非二次十二碼球，靑白已成敗將。昨球迷有意外之收穫，球賽淸爽快速，相當精彩，惜逸園草長，雨後地濕，屢失控制，美中不足。雙方皆有數次驚險之場面，美妙之射門，中柱或擦柱彈出，相差分寸可惜。英海軍身材高大，奔走快速，中堅及內鋒尤佳，靑白前鋒諸將，好像慢一步。吳祺祥不出，亦爲靑白吃緊之原因。靑白除孟義良費春華外，爲淸一色小將，相形之下，不免减色，栽判何春輝，巡邊陳吉祥，沈回春。</p>
<p>各中一球</p>
<p>英方先取攻勢，無功而返。小費得球傳中，殷慶炳打入門將手中，小費再來，股慶炳一頂，魏格詩接住踢出。十二分小費再度沿邊切中，小羅輕輕一撥，門將撲出。靑白屢攻未中。英軍攻勢旺盛，佔得優勢。十七分葛利芬，夏特奇猛撲，皆由黄仕傑救出。廿二分，劉體寅叩關，高出未中。之後金祿生與續依緹搶球受傷，幸未幾即告痊愈。至廿八分鐘，小羅得球傳祿生，金切入吊中，殷慶炳在後，如飛向前，毛腿起處，金石爲開，靑白先斬一關。嗣後金祿生二次得球進攻，均未奏功，至卅三分，英軍前鋒吊中，孟義良踢出不遠，伊文思竄上，一掃而入，上半時各一和局。</p>
<p>反敗為勝</p>
<p>檸機時間後，秦必高劉體寅下野，張鳳崗顧以撤入代，相持至八分鐘，夏特奇帶球深入，仕傑撲空，葛利芬連人帶球，滾入網中，二比一後來居上。英軍勢甚猖獗，靑白一再反攻，均無成效。否極泰來，廿五分鐘時，毛世曼在禁區絆倒小費，小羅主罰十二碼，扳成各二和局，此後英軍再度發動攻勢，至終塲前數分鐘，金錄生沿邊深入，得機傳中，孟義良乘勢拉門，毛世曼手觸阿斗，小費主罰，一掃而入，三比二靑白反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>靑白</p>

<h3>關於嘉爾克嘉</h3>
<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>十九世紀歐洲思想界出了兩個怪傑。這兩個怪傑對於當時的西洋文明都提出了嚴重的抗議。他們都不滿意十九世紀流行的思想。他們都主張思想界應有所改變。因此，他們的思想便和他們的時代不相容，而被目爲思想界的叛徒。不過，思想界的叛徒，往往是思想界的英雄。爲某一時代所排斥或忽視的思想，不一定就是毫無價值的思想。這些思想的價值，也許可爲另一時代所發現，所推祟。思想家常站在時代的前面。思想家和他的時代，其距離若過遠時，他即可不爲時代所認識。司馬遜所謂：「藏諸名山，以俟其人」的話，就是見到了這點而說的。</p>
<p>這兩個怪傑，一是德國的尼米（Nietzsche），是丹麥的嘉爾克嘉（Kierkegaard）。前者是國人所熟知的，用不着作者再來介紹。後者不惟我國人士很少聽到，就是英美人士知道有嘉氏其人，也不過是十多年以內的事情。嘉氏的著作，在十餘年前，都無英譯本可得。最早的一本英譯本是一九三二年美國德塞斯（Texas）大學的一本選譯本。直到第二次世界大戰發生後，嘉氏著作才逐漸被英美人士翻譯出來。到現在嘉氏著作差不多已全有了英譯本。自英美方面來說，嘉氏是這一次大戰被發現的思想家。不過，在德國嘉氏是早被發現的人物。當代德國兩位有名的哲人，如葉斯巴（Jaspers），如海特卡（Heidegger），都是受嘉氏思想的影響而建立他們的哲學的。所謂『生存哲學」（Philosophy　of　Existence），其淵源所自，就是嘉氏。即法國目前流行的『生存主義』（Existentialism），由文人沙德氏（Jean—PaulSartre）加以提倡的，也是以嘉氏爲鼻祖。嘉氏在現代思潮上遂成爲一位重要的人物，我們不能不加以注意。</p>
<p>究竟嘉爾克嘉是什麼人物呢？他是丹麥的詩人，宗教家，也是哲學家。他於一八一三年生於丹麥的哥本哈根，於一八五五年逝世，事年不過四十二歲。他曾熱懋過一個女人，却沒有什麼明顯理由又把這女人拋棄了。以後他便終身不娶。在大學時，他的生活頗爲浪漫，可是不久他却變爲一位虔誠的基督徒。他自認爲是一位眞正的基督徒，而對於當時的基督教則極不滿意。晚年他曾爲文攻擊丹麥的國家教會。所以在教會裏面他也差不多是一位叛徒。可是現在不然了。現在他被人認爲『宗教的詩人』，認爲『十九世紀最偉大的新教徒，認爲『自聖奧古斯丁以後一位對於宗教生活的心理最深刻的『解釋者』，甚且認爲是『一切時代上一位最偉大，最特殊的思想家』。</p>
<p>這位思想家的思想又是什麼呢？自然，這是不三言兩語所能說明的。這裏可以說的是，他是一位反對抽象思想，反對純粹理知的人物。他認爲人不是一個純粹思想家，而是一個『生存的個人』（Existing　Individual）。眞理也不是純客觀的，而是主觀的。眞理是主觀性的眞理，這是要個人用他絕對的誠懇，全部的熱情去發現，去把握的。這不是一種冷酷的注視，或無情的靜觀。這是個人自身全部精神和力量的表現。這是一種內部的掙扎，一種最重要的。「選擇」（Choice。每一人都得自己去發現他自己的眞理，『去發現對我爲真的眞理——我能依之而生而死的觀念。這種眞理的選擇，是我自己的選擇。決定我的選擇的，是我「生存個人」的「生存思維」，而不是抽象思維。我爲生與死的關係而作的選擇，是任何抽象思維所不能動搖的。對於選擇了耶穌基督爲其眞理的人，嘉氏說，「唯一可能的反對是，他可能由另一種方法而得救。對於這點，他不能回答。這有如一人對另一在熱愛中的人說，是的，但是你可能和另一個女子發生戀愛。對這點，這在戀愛中的人須得回客說，你這話我不能回答，因我只知道她是我的愛人。當這戀愛者能回答這問題時，他立即便不是一個戀愛者；所以當一個信仰者能回答上述問題時，他也立即便不是一個信仰者。」信仰不是理知上的事，眞理也不僅是理知上的事。思以理知解決一切，或以理知為宗教根據的人，都是嘉氏所反對的。</p>
<p>當人們對於理知失望時，嘉氏思想是必受歡迎的。戰爭是理知的失敗。嘉氏思想所以在戰時及在戰後流行，這一點是極有關係的。作者不敢接受嘉氏的思想。這是過於危險的思想。個人的誠懇和熱情，可把握眞理，也可把握錯誤。不以理知爲根據的選擇，往往是錯誤的選擇。不過，他和思想之值得注意，值得研究，這是無疑問的。</p>
<h3>心理上的人格</h3>
<p>— 孫祁</p>
<p>身者心之居宅，心者身之主宰，二者具有不可分離的關係，心離開身，則失去着落，無由存在；身離開心，則降爲無知覺的物質，毫無作用，人之整體，是以身與心構成者，身爲心之表現，心爲身之表現，我國先儒所謂：「心莊則體舒，心肅則容敬，」即係此意，所以人生活動，是包含身心兩方面，身體健康，固屬重要，而心理健康，尤爲重要，無健康之身體，固不足以當大任，無健康心理，又何足以爲人格之表徵，而改善社會。國父說：「國者人之積也，人者心之器也，而國事者一人羣心理之現象也，故政洽之隆汚，緊乎人心之振靡。」此即謂人之心理，是否健康，關係於個人國家者，至切至大。</p>
<p>人生活動，是由於機體的存在，有有在的機體，便覺知有「我」，嬰兒產生以後，便知道食乳，以自維其生，稍長遇事，無不爲「我」，一切活動，均以「我」爲本位，「我」是人人所認識者，而且是人人所重視者，故現代自我心理學者（Self　Psychology），如窩德（James　Ward）獨墨孤（McDougall），與卡爾京斯（Miss　Mary　W．Calkins）諸人，均以宇宙問一切東西，只有我最爲實在，其他均不足憑，此即謂人生第一目的，是在自我（Self），自我是身心活動統一的主體，在心理學上是一種機能的名詞，所以我們要保全心理健康，則對於自我必須先有正確的認識，自我之所以能存在，須表示以人格，普通所謂自愛者，是爲保持人格，即顯示人格與自我關係至爲密切。正如李石岑說：「心理上的人格，以自我爲中心」。</p>
<p>自我是由於一己的認識，而一己能認識，則又必以自覺爲之基礎，卡爾京斯說：「自我之積極的根據，在基於內省，」亦即此意，所謂自覺，簡言之，即是自知，自知並非易事，俗語說：「知人難，知己尤難」，希臘大哲學家蘇格拉底（Socvates）之治學方法，爲「知汝自己（Know　thyself）」。要知自己，第一即要自己能內省，能有曾子「吾日三省」的精神，利用心理學上的內省方法，省察自己的缺點與優點，知道自己的缺點以後，才能設法改善或避免，藉以减少錯誤或失敗，知道自己的優點以後，才能盡量發揮所長造福社會，倘若一個人不能自知，或妄自尊大，或自暴自棄，則不僅有誤自己，而且貽害社會。是以自覺在實現自我上佔着極重要的地位。蓋人除形骸以外，還有一種精神作川，可以代表「我」的存在，此種觀念、在常人雖未能個個明瞭。可是從實際上來看，無論何人，皆能因毀謗而忿怒，或愧悔，因獎賞而欣悅，或慚悚。一已有行動，皆知出於己之精神，雖在不識文字之人，只要其心理健康，亦能如此，此乃明顯之事實。至於程度較高之人，內省作用蛟優於他人，更能認識一己的精神作用此即可說「我之自覺」。</p>
<p>精神作用對於自我之最關緊要者，是在我底統一。我之心境思想雖時或不同，但認識事物的心靈，辨別是非的意識，總是一樣，昨日我固可以認識世界的事物，可以構成觀念，今日這種能力，還未消滅，還是存在，甚至在比校上還有點進步，而這些進步，是繼續以前的，根據以前的，並不是另外有別的要素加進來，所以這理解力是有根本不變的永存性。這不變的永存性，即是自我統一的表現。統一是維擊人格的一個關門，我們所以能取一條路向進發，不入歧途，即全憑這種統一力量。倘若喪失這種統一力量，則人格必然分裂，如同一意識，同時營兩個作用，而兩個作用，並無若何聯絡，此謂同時的二重人格，至如同一的人格，漸漸轉換爲相異的人格，甲人格突然變爲乙人格，此謂繼續的二重人格。此種缺乏統覺的現象，實爲心理上之病態。所以人格是以自我為內容，人格的完成，即自我麻統一。</p>
<p>自我底統一，是精神的意識作用，意識統一作用的發展性極大，不僅能統一五官百骸一切生理活動，還能統一知情意的心理活動，在心理活動所謂知情意之中，完全以意志爲主宰，意志是人格成立的根源，意志是重在有目的之鍜鍊，那重在精審觀察的「知」，與優越涵養的「情」，不過是輔助意志進於充實的副作用。意志的刺激是理想（Ideal），理想是使人進取的秘訣，亦是防人墮落的良方，俗語說：「人之好善，誰不如我」？進取向上之心，本是一種自然現象。此種現象顯現在心理上，但是自我實現，所以自我活動，即是意志活動。意志具有最高威權，有力控制而克服與其目的不相投之一切本能的情緒衝動，使心靈的個人揉成一個健康的自我，能够滿足自我正當的理想，而取得自我實現的快樂。</p>
<p>人之所以爲人，是在於人有人格，人格之所以健全，是在於自我健康，有了健康的自我，才能以人格爲目的，節制「小我」的放縱，極力圖謀，「大我」的發展，孟子說：「從其大體爲大人，從其小體爲小人」，「大體」即是「大我」，是專指心靈一方而言，「小體」即是「小我」，是專指耳目口腹而言。人能自覺大體之可貴，由一點心靈——精神作用，擴而充之，便可以得到「眞我」。所謂「眞我」，乃是精神之我，不是形骸之我的「幻我」，一個軀體全部，儘可衰老死亡，而精神之作用可如常，普通所調「精神永存」，實在即是專指精神之價值而言，並井如宗教家所謂「死後有靈」的意思。</p>
<p>一己認識自我，力求人格實現，固爲立身進德之要務，但同時還要本自存存人及人存我存之心理，而「兼義天下」，「己欲立而立人，己欲達而達人」，才能顯示出一己人格之偉大，所以現在社會之不篝，人心之萎靡，此固與人之心理不健康，缺乏自覺有關，但主要的還是由於多數人「只掃自己門前雪，休管他人瓦上霜」，之頹廢習慣所致，尤其一般負有社會責任的知識階級，大都持着「獨善其身」的能態度，以爲事非我爲，或事不干己而不理，要知個人與社會的關係極爲密切，個人底活動可影響及全社會，而個人同時亦受全社會的影響，故爲個人計，爲社會計，不僅自己要爲善不爲惡，並且亦要別人爲善不爲惡，自己爲善不爲惡，是消極的，勸告別人爲善不爲惡，才是積極的。否則，別人爲惡不爲善，直接固然有害於社會，而問接亦未嘗不有害於各個人。君子是愛人以德，不是愛人以姑息。投一石可以燙全海，種好因定有好果，我們不但要力謀個人人格高尚，並要以同類意識，促成別人人格高尚，藉各個人人格的相互影響，健康人之心理，以謀社會之改善，始克奏效。</p>
<p>從人類全體來看，人格的高低，極不一致，人格的等級，亦復不齊，人格之所以能高尚，所以能廣大，實賴人類心力爲之，心爲「萬事之本源」，我們必要先能保全心理健康，才能使人對於外來或內發的刺激，發出相當的適應，可以順應事變，以立定人格的尊嚴，進而完成其完整的人格。</p>
<h3>亞里士多德的第一哲學</h3>
<p>— 自強</p>
<p>亞里士多德雖然把各門科學統歸於哲學範圍之內，其實在他的系統裏已經隱隱約約有自然科學與社會科學的分別，只是在這些科學之上加以哲學。哲學，他呌做最高原理之學，或第一哲學；其他學問爲第二，（他的物理學即有第二哲學之稱）第三，……等哲學。亞氏繼蘇格拉底柏拉圖二氏之傳，以爲學問這東西無非是一束的概念，槪念即原理，那麼學問只是一束的原理，原理分起類來便成各門的學問。亞氏的系統，粗而言之，分爲理論，實踐，創造，三類，細而言之，再分爲物理，生物，心理，……各門，—這都是把原理分類而成的。再把各類原理匯合起來，用歸納演繹之法所求得統攝一切原理的原理，他呌做最高原理。關於最高原理的學問，他呌做最高原理之學或第一哲學；其實就是普通所謂哲學，從他的整個系統的立塲看，應當稱爲狹義的哲學。</p>
<p>亞氏把哲學當作最高原理之學，和柏氏之以哲學爲一切知識的頂層，其精神正是相同。所以亞氏的學說，除科學的部分爲柏氏所缺者外，在哲學（狹進的，就是形而上學）方面，和柏氏所走的路一樣：柏氏把哲學建築在尋常知與理性知之上，亞氏把哲學建築在各門科學之上，他們同是開現代所謂科學的形而上學之先路。下面再把他們對於哲學（柏氏呌做理型學或辯證學，亞氏呌做第一哲學或最高原理之學）的異同詳細比較一下：</p>
<p>同的方面：（一）對象—哲學的對象是純有（Pure　Being），一切存在的共同的底蘊。（二）工作，哲學是追求事物的根底，目的在達到萬事萬物背後普遍的而終極的根據與原因。（三）地位—哲學的地位在一切學問之上，是一切學問的總匯。（四）功用—哲學的功用在替人生求最高至善的幸福。他們對於哲學作以上的看法，所以哲學家在他們的心目中簡直成個無所不知的人，其知識是一切學問的匯粹。</p>
<p>異的方面：（一）內容—柏氏以爲哲學包括知與行兩方面；亞氏卻把知與行分得淸淸楚楚，哲學在他只是從理論的本能出發，和實踐的本能無干。（二）材料—柏氏所用的材料限於純粹的概念，他的哲學只是一大堆理型的分合散聚；亞氏所用的材料卻是經驗上的事實，他所謂最高原理可以還原到經驗上的事實，其實就是從經驗中得來的。</p>
<p>再把亞氏所謂第一哲學和他的系統中其餘的部分比較，我們對它更能認識淸楚些：（一）和實踐部分與創造部分的分別—（甲）實踐上與創造上的動作，其目標不在動作本身，而在動作所致之果，例如倫理上的動作目標在其所發見的行爲的規範，藝術上的動作目標在其作品。哲學上的動作却不然，哲學的動作是思想，思想的目標就在思想，並不在思想以外的另一事物。（乙）哲學是純粹思想之事，和情感·感覺，—所謂人性中的非理解部分無干。實踐與創造兩部分的學問却和情感與感覺發生很密切的關係，醫術之不能脫離感覺固不待言，至於倫理，則亦無以佻於情欲等問題。（二）和物理學與數學的分別—物理學的對象是有形體，能變動的東西，因爲它的對象全是形下的事物，形下的事物沒有無形體和不變動的。數學的對象不變動，但是有形體，例如幾何學的圖形，雖然永遠不變動，却是有形體。唯有哲學的對象才是不變動而且無形體，因爲宇宙間的最高原理萬古不能變動，同時也無形體可言。</p>
<h3>學林樷話（廿三）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>西哲論華化（下）</p>
<p>艾默生以爲中國的優點不僅在其重視教育，中國歷史上有好幾種重大的發明，在天文學上中國亦有所貢獻，至其歷史記載的悠久則爲他國所不及。中國過去於自然現象的探究用力過少，無庸置言。但幾千年來中國學人終身致力於學術，作深遠而宏遠的思索者何可勝數。一旦中國學人轉移其心力於大自然方面，則中國科學研究定能有加速度的進展，試看近三十年來的中國科學，可爲此說的明證。一九三五年巳故中央研究院總幹事丁文江博士，曾扼要地寫過一篇報告，題爲「中國科學的研究」，載於是年八月十日英國自然周刊。近年英國倫敦大學裴納教授（J．B．Berral）在他的新著「科學在社會上之功用」一本書裏曾說道：『從其已往的成就察之，就不難潘出中國文化的背景，果能稍稍加以改造，便可成爲非常良好科學工作的園地。以中國人治事謹嚴的態度，忍耐的習慣，中庸的德性，可以預期中國對於科學的供獻，決不在歐美之下。』中國新科學的萌芽，有好些是從四方移殖而來。目前中國各大學好些名教授會留學西洋，歸國以後在教育學術界有顯著成就者實緊有徒。</p>
<p>第一次大戰各終以後，杜威與羅素均應中國之聘，曾在各大學講學。羅素本其親自閱歷，於中國文化曾作批許，略謂：『西方文化的長處在於科學方法，中國文化的長處在於合理的人生觀，吾人希望二老能够逐漸結合而爲一。』中國近年有一種新思潮，與科學發展同時幷進，是即新孔學運動，這是一種積極的批評的人文主義。中國文化將籍新的孔學與科學二者之合流而復興起來，相信這種新文化對於當前世界種稱難題，會有適當的對策，至少對於難題的解答會有所裨助。</p>
<p>有一位當代大哲曾說：『中國的藝術，中國的文學和中國的人生哲學，我們了解愈多，那末對於中國文化的高超境界，愈生仰慕之心，以歷史的綿遠及人口的衆庶論，中國文化顯爲世界文化最壯大的一派。』這是哈佛大學退休教採懷黑特（A．N．Whitehead），的言論。中國文化當然有許多弱點，我們並非不自覺。中國學人胸襟開朗，願意接受外來的新觀念，現代國際接觸日益頻繁，我們深感學術文化的國際性日益濃厚。</p>
<p>艾默生晚年曾經宣言一個新時代就要開始，其意即謂東西文化將糾聚於一堂。艾默生爲美國學者着意研討東方的思想文物的第一人。他對於中國文化的興趣垂老不義，所以要做這一個新時代的宣佈者和解釋者，亦唯此公最爲適宜，歷史上大思想家往往起越於時代，艾氏的遠見和卓識可謂歷久而常新。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>讀者意見　滬太公路設備簡陋　乘客聯名要求改進</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我們是一　滬太公路的乘客，由於該公司種種腐敗情形，使我們難以緘默，特借貴報一角，向社會人士申訴，以促其改進。</p>
<p>（一）設備簡陃關於骰備，包括車站，車輛，路面，橋梁等，目前一切都在敷衍。車站沒有一個像樣些的，乘客候車，沒有坐的地方；（上海站稍好，但櫈子也太少。）車輛時常「拋錨」；路面，橋梁一塌糊塗，收了不少養路費，不肯好好修路；橋面壤的地方，上面另加二條洋松了事，豈不兇險？他們省了錢，乘客的安全實大成問題了。</p>
<p>（二）服務欠周各站職員大多廳慢無理，尤以沿綫某小站爲甚。乘客不特下車，先擠上云。致下車者反不能下，站員置若無觀，上海站亦骯體不堪，車上更不見有人掃除；買票，開車，時常不運守規定時間，有時離開車前十分鐘才賈票，有時乘客購票進去，找不到車子，要等上一個鐘頭，尤以星六，星日兩天，上海及大塲站秩序非常沘亂。</p>
<p>（三）漲價奇速該公司車票價格，貴得可以，漲的速度和倍數，也相當驚人。上海市公用事業漲價，不過百分之二十光景，還要受到各界批評指摘；他們卻一漲就是百分之五十。同時，我們知道他們每月是賺錢而並不虧本，所以一再漲價，實屬無理剝削。</p>
<p>最後，我們請滬太公司認淸本身事業的性質，　謀改進，以利人羣。讀者沈小健正清王德明姜永安等今啓</p>

<h3>再訪梅蘭芳（上）</h3>
<p>— 曹子愷</p>
<p>去年梅花時節，我從重慶回上海不久，就去訪梅博士，曾有照片及文章刊登申報。今年淸明過後，我同長女陳寶四女一吟，兩個愛平劇的女兒，到上海看梅博士演劇，深恐在出演期內添他應酬之勞，原想不去訪他。但看了一本洛神之後，次日到底又去訪了。因爲陳寶和一吟渴望瞻仰伶王的眞面目。預備看過眞面目之後，再看這天晚上的販馬記。</p>
<p>這回不告訴外人，不邀攝影記者同去，但托他的二胡師倪秋平君光去通知，然後於下午四時，同了兩女兒悄悄地去訪。剛要上車，偏偏曾在四馬路上遇見我的次女的夫壻宋慕法。他正坐在路旁的藤椅裘教人擦皮鞋，聽見我們要去訪梅先生，擦了半雙就指進我們的車子裏，一同前去了。陳寶和一吟說他，「天外飛來的好運氣！」因爲他也愛好平劇，不過不及陳寶一吟之迷。在戯迷者看來，得識伶王的眞面目，比「瞻仰大顏」更爲光榮，比「面見如來」更多法悅。所以我們在梅家門前下車，叩門，門內跑出兩隻小洋狗來的時候，慕法就取笑她們，說「你們但願得一人做一隻吧？」</p>
<p>坐在去春曾經來坐過的客室裏，我看看室中的陳設，與去春無甚差異。回味我自己的心情，也與去春無甚差異。「靑春永駐」，正好拿這四字來祝福我們所訪問的主人。主人尚未下樓，琴師倪秋平先來相陪。這位琴師也頗不尋常：他在台上用二胡拉皮簧，在台下却非常愛好西洋音樂，對朔拿大，交饗樂的蓄音片，愛逾拱璧。他的女兒因有此家學，在國立音樂院爲高才生。他的愛好西洋昔樂，據他自己說是由於讀了我的舊著「音樂常識」（亞東圖書館版）。因此他常和我通信，這回方始見面。我住在天蟾舞台斜對面的振華旅館裏。他每夜拉完二胡，就抱了琴囊到旅館來和我談天，談到後半夜。談的半是平劇，半是西樂。我學西樂而愛好皮簧，他拉皮簧而愛好西樂，形相反而實相成，所以話談不完。這下午他先到梅家來等我們。我白天看見倪秋平，這還是第一次。我和他閒談了幾句，主人就下來了。</p>
<p>握手寒喧之間，我看見梅博士比去春更加年輕了。臉面更加豐滿，頭髪重加靑黑，態度更加和悅了。又瞥見陳寶一吟和慕法，目不轉睛地注視他，一句話也不說，一動也不動，好像城隍廟喪的三個菩薩，我覺得好笑。不料他們的視綫忍從主人身上轉到我身上，都笑起來。我明白這笑的意思了：我年齡比這位主人小四歲，而蒼顏白髮，老相十足；比我大四歲的這位老兄，却靑鬢常靑，做我的弟弟還不够；何况晚上又能在舞臺表演美妙的姿態！上帝如此造人，眞是欠通欠通！怎不令人發笑呢？</p>
<p>我提出關於洛神的舞台面的話，希望能攝製有聲有色的電影，使牠永遠地普遍地流傳。梅先生說有種極困難，一時未能實現。關於製電影，去春我也向他勸請過。我覺得這事在他是最重要的急務。我們弄書畫的人，把原稿製版精印，便可永遠地普遍地琉傳，唱戯的人雖有蓄音片，但只能保留唱工；要保留做工，非製電煜不可。科學發達到這原子時代，能用繼匐大小的一顆東西來在頃刻之間殺死千萬生靈，却不肯替我們的「曠世天才」製幾個影片。這又是欠通欠通，怎不令人長噢呢！</p>
<p>話頭轉入了象徵表現的方面。梅先生說起他在莫斯科所見投水的表演；一大塊白布，四角教人扯住，動　起來，賽是水波；布上開泂，人跳入洞中，又攢出來，賽是投水。他說，我們的打漁殺家則不然，不需要布，就用身子的上下表示波浪的起伏。說這話時，他就坐在沙發裏穿着西裝而略作桂英兒的身段，大家發出特殊的笑聲。這使我回想起以前我在某處講演時，無意中在黑板上晝了一個人頭而在聽衆中所引起的笑聲。對於平劇的象徵的表現，我很贊善。爲的是與我的漫畫的省略的筆法相似之故。我畫人像，臉孔上大都只畫一隻嘴巴，而不發眉目。或竟述嘴巴都不　，相貌全讓看者肖己想像出來。（因此去年有某小報拿我取笑，大字標題目「豐子愷不要臉」，文章內容，先把我恭維一頓，末了說，他的畫獨創一格，寥寥數筆，神氣活現，貫人頭不畫瞼孔云云。只看標題而沒有工夫看文章的人，一定以爲我做了不要臉的事。這小報眞是朢謔！）這正與平劇的表現相似：開門，騎馬，搖船，都沒有眞的門，馬，與船，全讓觀者自己想像出來。想像出來的門，馬，與船，比實際的美麗得多。倘有實際的背景，反而不討好了。好比我有時偶把眉目口鼻一一畫出；相貌確定了，往往覺得不過如此，一覽無餘，反比不畫而任人自由想像的笨拙得多。</p>

<p>海上爲人文薈萃之地，騷人墨客，靴自四方來爲寓公，雖車馬塵囂，市賈塡咽，然吟囊酒榼，猶有刻燭畫壁之風，如曩時之南社嗚社希社，今之懷超社咸是也。懷超社，爲善化瞿蛻園所主持，所以紀念其先尊文慎公鴻璣者也。鴻璣字子玖，號止庵，淸同治進士，官至工部尚書，協辦大學士，工詩，與伯嚴，樊山，節庵，藝風，乙菴，常相唱和，槧有戳文慎公詩選，陳石遺老人評之爲條達妥貼者也。晚年寓海上，榜其居曰超覽樓，讀書吟嘯其中，幾忘人問甲子。蛻園因邀集其先尊之故吏門生，立詩社，定名爲懷超社，一時名士如孫滄叟，楊宛叟，高吹萬，吳眉孫諸丈，凡十餘人，　韻拈題，輒有佳什，或比諸西園雅集，輝映後先。滄叟與宛叟在社中，年事爲最高，均八十有餘。滄電名儆，別號北山翁，善寫殷虛貞卜文字，早歲肄業南菁，治公羊學，曾宰靑神縣，有政聲，前年重遊沖水，賦詩追述庭訓，人以孝思不匱稱之。宛叟，泰興人，名體仁，與亡師程瑤笙先生爲總角交，詩蒼凉激楚，似杜陵當年，又工書法，遒逸古雅，有鸞鶴停躊之態，正擬與海上人士廣結翰墨綠也。吹萬與眉孫二人，爲同年同月同日生，吹萬號寒葩，眉孫號寒竽，因有牢落江關頭未白，寒光兩兩　然新之句。去歲，假東坡生日，會詩人於其蘭若，予廁列其問，晉觴祝嘏，蓋二丈皆古稀七十，壽蘇正所以自壽也。是日蛻園亦在座，淸譚蟬嫣，至日西殮始散云。</p>
<h3>乘桴浮海</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>一八九六年時，布魯克林有兩個挪威人，在新吉賽海外撈摸牡蠣爲生。兩人一名桑莫生，一名哈寶，天生膂力過人，富於海上經驗。一天，桑莫生對哈寶說：「如其有人肯冒險划渦海洋，可以立成鉅富。人們情願出了錢來看這艘小船的。」二人都認爲此事非獨力所能勝任，但利用兩個人的努力，則能够在兩個月中完成航程，他們預定一天划五十四哩。因此他們願意試一次。</p>
<p>他們費了兩年功夫，利用閑暇來進行這一計劃，他們打樣造成的船長十八呎，「警報」發行人福克斯資助他們建造木船，因即以「福克斯」名此獨木船。船夫們看到了他們的木船都搖頭歎息，但桑莫生及哈實仍埋首苦幹，裝配一切。船裏配備了五柄槳，一隻羅盤，六分儀，一個坐墊，信號燈，五介侖火油，以備船前小爐灶上之用。伙食方面有鷄蛋二百五十枚，餅乾一百磅，咖啡九磅，以及不少聽裝肉類。服裝方面除了隨身穿戴及一套油衣之外別無其他衣著，船上沒有烟草，酒類和風帆。</p>
<p>「福克斯」號飄出大海，兩個挪咸人開始仔細計算路程：一天中每人至少要劃十五小時又半。開頭氣候極好，但伺候那隻油爐卻是够麻煩的。就是在微風中也難於使汕爐燃着。他們的咖啡極少，鷄蛋不久也吃光了。</p>
<p>第四夜上，哈寳在船邊睡着了，突然他醒轉順喊：「有什麼東西在撞我們的船！</p>
<p>他們轉着，又是在船底一撞，於是從昏暗的水裏閃出一條白色的魚。「一條鯊魚！」哈寳說。這條鯊魚跟木船游了兩天，兩人毫不在心，一心一意划向他們的目的地巴黎去。</p>
<p>出發後一星期，海上氣候突變，一陣狂暴的東風迎頭吹來，波濤愈衝愈高，翻過福克斯號，上午九時，兩人放棄劃駛，拋下錨索。下午五時，哈寳計算旅程，却是倒退了二十五哩。</p>
<p>兩人盡力划船，有時唱唱歌，但大部份時間却是在盡力划船。七月一日，在「大難」遇到一艘漁船，船長招呼之下，大爲驚奇，請他們登船小憇，三星期來，哈寶和桑莫生第一次吃到一頓燒煮的午餐。</p>
<p>七月七日，西方海上忽來狂飚，他們和洶湧的海濤搏戰已有兩天，一天中他們戽水有十次之多。第二夜大浪擊來，把「福克斯」號衝翻，兩人落到寒冷的海水中。但在此危難之時，他們早有安排，每人身上轉一個救命圈，並用繃子聯　在木船邊，船上並裝有攀手，可使航海者攀住。經過幾次努力，他們才把船翻過來，爬進木船，用力戽水。所帶糧食大部飄流；衣服完全浸濕。</p>
<p>幸虧隨即風平浪靜，但他們的手背經過雨打風吹日曬的結果，疼痛萬分。最困難的是糧食缺乏，總算在七月十五日，遇到一艘同鄉船「西妥」號，重又裝配到淡水和新鮮食物。於是繼續航行。</p>
<p>八月一日，他們望到了英國西南部的小島細黎羣島，八月七日，駛抵法國勒哈佛港口，一時岸邊歡聲雷動云。</p>
<h3>廢木變肉論</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>有一位德國科學家柏吉斯，（現在美軍步兵師中服務）發明了一種奇蹟：「廢木變肉類一。當盟軍轉炸毀滅德國的工業以後，兩個工廠月可出產木料食物八百噸，足供一百七十萬德國民衆戰時內類定量配給之用。此項工廠如有一百處，則其生產即足供戰後數年中渡過飢饉時期之用。</p>
<p>這個消息，給我的感想是—</p>
<p>對於許許多多大呼精神文明挽救人類浩刦而否定科學的復古論者是一個頂好的駁斥；反科學的所謂「精神文明」的偉大處，據說可以消弭「殺伐」，而對於自然科學的發達，則被認爲可能助畏殺機。但事實却證明了科學愈發達，人類愈進步，殺伐的需要却愈益减少，不但對於人，而且推而及於生物。例如戰爭的原因，「人口論」的論據是由食物不够分配而起。果如上述消息所示廢木可以變肉，人類還有什麼食料不够以及引起戰爭的杞憂呢？充此發明至極，將使世界上的食物取之不盡用之不竭，自然而然不會再存在着什麼以戰爭爲出路的所謂「無的國家」了。又如所謂精神文明之所以感人動聽者，在於「祥和」，無論道教佛教，茹素戒殺的動機，原無可厚非。但其結果，却祗能依靠人的壓制了自己的本能底「苦行」，不但祗限於少數高僧高道才能履行這苦行式的戒條，而且還須犧牲健康，犧牲營養，以換取對於生物博愛利它的實踐。就是說：不殺生由於主觀的，強制的善念，而非客觀上自然條件使他們不需要殺生。廢木變肉的發明，將使人類不犧牲健康而躋於不殺生之境，豈非眞正的偉大的文明。「精神文明」，假如人間眞有這個東西，也必有賴於科學的進步而後產生，始有所附麗，否則祇是玄學家的幻想。</p>
<p>要澈底的消滅戰爭危機，還在社會科學與自然科學同樣進步，相輔而行。</p>
<h3>怎樣鋻別金魚的雌雄</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>飼養金魚的朋友，往往喜歡把它配成一對對，要是色彩同形態配得一模一樣，尚屬易事，而要配成恰巧一雌一雄，那就非常困難。</p>
<p>長成到幾年的金魚，魚園索價奇昂，要是細算起來，却也並不爲貴，因爲，要在數千穆魚裏去選擇花色，形態，一般大小的魚，非經過三五年的歲月，才能長大。往往很好一對魚，非全雌即是全雄，如非在幼年擇種時候，就光把雌雄也來配好，才能使它們偕老成雙，勿使孤單單地變成形單影隻。</p>
<p>金魚的鑒別雌雄，在寸許長的時候，就能很明顯地看到了。要是不能肯定的話，還可以用手來摸索，捉魚在手，用指抵着它的腹部雄魚則鱗片緊包，堅硬無隙，雌魚腹部奇軟，蓋因蘊有卵珠（魚的卵珠，散子時僅散出一部份），一摸便可分曉。</p>
<p>至於三四年的大魚，在散子時期，雄魚的緒尾張裂着，似有白色的刺，還能發出光來，更能一目瞭然是雄魚了。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>世界大局之糟，人類之日趨於毀滅白相殘殺，雖只是少數英雄式的男性所爲，非全部男子之責任，而女子則全無責任。例如好戰廳武之德魔，前者如威廉第二，如俾士麥，後者如希特勒，何一而非横眉努目，凶神惡煞。又如義大利之墨索里尼，滿臉的横肉，狀如活聲，被固未嘗不自命爲豪傑之士大丈夫之所爲也。又如日本，一向重男輕女，然日本婦女雖以家庭之賢母良妻自限，確有溫和勤漢之可親風度。設想假使日本早由重男輕女轉到重女輕男，使政治軍事外交，皆以甚麼一條柳子，千條月子，上村靑子，下田梅子當之，決不至如土肥原，田中義一，本莊，荒木，東條之肆行無忌。吾故引申某市長某院長之言，而製爲口號曰：「全球各族的Womankind聯合起來！」「建設女性的特別國際！」「全世界男性退伍！所有統治及一切軍政大事，皆由女性取而代之。」「對於男子之許多罪惡，澈底淸算。」自「女性特別國際」成立後，所有從前之任何特別國際，及普通國際，一律作廢！</p>
<p>歐人以「人」Mankind專屬於「男」，說Mankind即是全人類，惟至單指婦女，乃有所謂Woman焉，有所謂Womankind焉。Woman者，Wifeman之縮文也。與中國之「婦人」不謀而合，巳含有不平等之意味。但歐人又以GentleSex爲女性之專稱，然則男性之爲Rough　Sex，巳不言可喩·由此觀之，野餐的男性之理應自譴自休，更有何辭。</p>
<h3>近作二律</h3>

<p>客懷</p>
<p>春老家鄉客滯迥，戰塵白髮一莖催，天地無私多殺戮，園林欲隱每排徊；匆忙歲月詩千卷，離亂山河酒萬杯，安得靜寗如入定，此心忽忽定中灰？</p>

<h3>Presidential Message Approved by the Legislative Yuan; Weng Wenhao Appointed Head of the Executive Yuan; List of Cabinet Ministers Expected to Be Largely Finalized Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] President Chiang Kai-shek submitted a message to the Legislative Yuan in the afternoon of the 24th, seeking their approval of the nominee for Premier of the Executive Yuan. The message was personally delivered to the Legislative Yuan by Xu Jingzhi, Director of the First Bureau. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Presidential Message (One) No. 1, May 24th, Year 37</p>
<p>It is hereby proposed that Weng Wenhao be appointed as the Premier of the Executive Yuan. It is noted that Mr. Weng is an internationally renowned scholar who has served as a member of the National Government and Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan. He has a long-standing reputation for his understanding of both domestic and international affairs. In particular, for more than a decade, he has served as the head of the Third Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the War Production Board, and the Resources Commission, dedicating his efforts to economic construction and the strengthening of national defense resources, achieving remarkable results. He has also made significant contributions to international relations, education, and culture. At the beginning of this constitutional era, with the dual tasks of suppressing rebellion and building the nation internally, and securing American aid externally, the responsibilities are heavy and the tasks are numerous, requiring a person of exceptional talent. Appointing him as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, it is firmly believed that he will be able to handle the position with ease and satisfaction. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, this consultation is made to seek your approval so that the appointment can be made. This message is directed to the Legislative Yuan. President Chiang Kai-shek. (Photo of Weng Wenhao, recent photo).</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] President Chiang Kai-shek's message to the Legislative Yuan on the 24th proposed the appointment of Weng Wenhao as the Premier of the Executive Yuan. The Legislative Yuan held its third session of the first meeting on the afternoon of the 24th, exercising its power of consent for the first time. Wu Tiecheng was elected as the chairman according to law, and the session was changed to a plenary meeting to conduct review and discussion. On the point of "requesting the President to notify Mr. Weng to submit his policy opinions," it was passed with the support of a majority of 388 members, finding it unnecessary. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan continued its third session and held a secret ballot. The results showed that a majority of 489 votes solemnly approved the appointment of Weng Wenhao as the Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Weng Wenhao accepted the appointment as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution on the 24th, and immediately began the work of forming his cabinet that evening. After the Legislative Yuan approved his appointment as Premier, Weng stated that he had been appointed suddenly this time, and that he had not yet started any preparations. He needed to consult with the President and contact various parties before he could make any decisions. Weng then went to the official residence at 9 p.m. to meet with the President, seeking instructions on the selection of the Deputy Premier and ministers of the new Executive Yuan, as well as the political commissioners and the chief and deputy secretaries-general, and on the guidelines for governance. The President will issue the order appointing Weng as Premier of the Executive Yuan on the 25th, and other candidates are being consulted separately, and it is expected that a general decision will be made on the 25th. It is reported that the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party will still have ministers and political commissioners in the Executive Yuan, and several prominent figures from society will also participate in order to jointly govern and complete the constitutional nation-building work. It is also learned that Weng has scheduled a press conference at the Resources Commission at 4:30 p.m. on the 25th to report on personnel and policy matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Sun Ke and Chen Lifu sent telegrams on the 24th congratulating Weng Wenhao on his appointment as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution.</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan Replies to the President, Requesting Mr. Weng to Submit Policy Guidelines After Taking Office</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The Legislative Yuan has reported to President Chiang Kai-shek on the process and results of exercising its power of consent over the appointment of the Premier of the Executive Yuan on the night of the 24th. This message was delivered by Guang Lang, Director of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, to Xu Jingzhi, Director of the First Bureau of the Presidential Palace, at 10:30 p.m. The message first stated that the Legislative Yuan, in accordance with Article 55 of the Constitution, exercised its power of consent for the first time. After receiving the President's message, it was submitted to the plenary committee for review, and it was deemed that the appointment of Mr. Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan could be approved. The third meeting then resolved to approve it. In addition, it included a summary of the opinions of the members during the review by the plenary committee, requesting the President to inform Mr. Weng to submit a report on policy guidelines to the Legislative Yuan after taking office as Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the Legislative Yuan's message of reply agreeing to Weng Wenhao's appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan was delivered to the Presidential Palace, President Chiang Kai-shek attached three appointment orders for Mr. Weng to countersign and issued them late at night: (1) Special appointment of Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan; (2) Special appointment of Wu Dingchang as Secretary-General of the Presidential Palace; (3) Special appointment of Xue Yue as Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace. The order appointing Mr. Weng was also countersigned by himself, because according to the Constitution, the Premier of the Executive Yuan has the legal qualifications after being nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan, and any order of the President must be countersigned by the Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Review and Voting Process in the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The third meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 3:50 p.m. on the 24th. President Sun Ke chaired the meeting. After passing the minutes of the second meeting, President Sun instructed the Secretariat to read out Presidential Message (One) No. 1, in which President Chiang Kai-shek nominated Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan and requested approval in accordance with Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution. The attendees listened and applauded to express their welcome. President Sun then declared: According to Article 53 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure on the Exercise of the Power of Consent: "When exercising the power of consent in accordance with Article 55 of the Constitution, the plenary committee shall review the matter and submit it to the plenary session for voting. The plenary committee shall elect one member to serve as chairman to solicit the consent of the attendees and preside over the meeting."</p>
<p>Plenary Meeting for Review and Discussion</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng was then publicly elected as chairman. Mr. Sun then withdrew with the Chief and Deputy Secretaries-General Zhang Zhaoyuan and Yan Guofu, and the plenary committee meeting was reconvened under the chairmanship of Mr. Wu. Qi Zhihou spoke first, advocating for approval. He said: Mr. Weng Wenhao enjoys a high reputation in international academic circles and has no factional affiliations in domestic political circles. He is a suitable candidate for the current Premier of the Executive Yuan. He only hopes that he can appoint new people to implement new policies. Tian Yushi also followed, saying that Weng is an honest and promising scientist and politician who should be approved by the Legislative Yuan, but before approval, public opinion should also be reflected. He said: Although Weng has very good qualifications, his past political achievements have not been perfect, so he has three expectations for his future policies: (1) to organize a new cabinet that is detached, neutral, and progressive to carry out government affairs, (2) to form a cabinet of talent, and the ministers of the old Executive Yuan should be retained or eliminated separately, without regard to factions, but attention should be paid to the extension and distribution of talent from various regions, (3) to pay attention to the needs of the country and the people, establish policies, and eliminate the phenomenon of paralysis with the courage of a sharp knife cutting through tangled hemp. Tian also finally advocated omitting the procedure stipulated in Article 54 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure, which states that "if deemed necessary, the Legislative Yuan may request the President to notify the nominee to submit his policy opinions." Wang Jian'e said: He did not know much about Weng, but for the sake of the current situation, he supported the President's opinion. He hoped that the new Executive Yuan could (1) eliminate the rampant corruption of high officials, (2) cut redundant agencies. Zhang Jinjian then pointed out that the materials introducing Weng in the President's message were not enough to understand his policies, and advocated that the President be requested to notify Weng to submit his policy opinions. He said: The bad things about past political affairs were that the people in charge were good at perfunctory, but their implementations deviated from national policies. Weng has a wide range of contacts and is extremely clean, but he should be able to make his subordinates not corrupt. Moreover, Weng is someone who has received a lot of capitalist and liberal education, and whether he can accurately implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, regulate capital, and benefit all the people, must be guaranteed by his policy opinions. Otherwise, if the Legislative Yuan rashly approves it without any basis, it would be a disservice to its duties. Ma Chengfeng also said: Judging from Weng's past style, unless there are new methods, it cannot be confidently believed that he can open up the current difficult situation. What his new methods are should be shown to the Legislative Yuan first before he can be trusted and agreed to. Hu Jianzhong and Cheng Cangbo successively expressed their opposition to this opinion, believing that policy opinions were not necessary before approval, but the Legislative Yuan's opinions should be paid attention to. Hu also said: The current priority is to suppress rebellion and banditry and enrich people's livelihood. When Weng was the Minister of Economic Affairs, he was only interested in heavy industry, but there was a lack of achievements in civil industry. As the Chairman of the Resources Commission, his control over his subordinates was also inadequate, so he was not the most ideal candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan, but for the sake of political stability, it is also possible to agree to this honest and capable scholar. Cheng then explained that the person in charge does not have to be a genius, but that his policies are important, and then described what he heard from international friends in Europe and the United States about their concern for our country, which focused on two points: one is the communist bandit problem, and the other is currency inflation, in other words, military affairs and finance. Therefore, he believes that Weng's policy measures should focus on military needs and military training and the redistribution of wealth. Pan Chaoying then pointed out that the new Executive Yuan must end the wavering and unstable diplomatic policy, and at 4:40 p.m., the attendees requested to end the review and discussion. Chairman Wu then solicited the opinions of the attendees on the question of whether it was necessary to request the President to notify Weng to submit his policy opinions in accordance with Article 54 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure. The opinions of the members were divided, and after voting, it was only with a majority of 388 people in favor (587 members present) that it was passed that this was not necessary. At 4:50 p.m., the plenary committee meeting came to an end and adjourned.</p>
<p>Third Session Voting</p>
<p>At 5:20 p.m., the third meeting continued. Wu Tiecheng reported on the plenary committee's review of the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan nominated by the President. President Sun announced that in accordance with Article 56 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure, a secret ballot would be held to decide whether to approve Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan. Wang Qijiang, Deng Hongye, Fan Yushui, Yang Yuqing and other twelve people were designated as supervisors. Voting began at 5:30 p.m. The members went to the podium in an orderly manner to sign and receive their ballots, marked the printed "Agree" or "Disagree" options, and put them into the ballot box. The voting was completed in half an hour. President Sun reported that the supervisors had received 680 ballots, issued 605 ballots, and 75 blank ballots remained. The vote counting then began and was completed in ten minutes under the supervision of the supervisors. At 6:15 p.m., President Sun reported the results of the vote count, with a total of 603 ballots cast in the ballot box. Excluding 20 invalid ballots, the number of valid ballots was 583, including 489 votes in favor and 94 votes against. "The Legislative Yuan solemnly agrees to Mr. Weng Wenhao's appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan." The meeting adjourned at 6:20 p.m.</p>
<h3>First Supervisory Yuan to Convene on June 1st; Preparatory Committee Sends Telegrams to Supervisory Committee Members to Prepare to Attend</h3>
<p>[Central Decision Society, Nanjing, 24th] The first Supervisory Yuan will convene on June 1st. This was decided by President Sun today regarding the new Premier of the Executive Yuan. However, the official convention will await the official promulgation after the new Premier of the Executive Yuan is announced. The Supervisory Yuan Preparatory Committee has already telegraphed the elected Supervisory Committee members from the election offices in each province and city after receiving notification from the Presidential Palace, in preparation for their attendance in Nanjing as scheduled. According to the person in charge of the Preparatory Committee today, the registration of the Supervisory Committee members can begin as soon as the convocation order is announced. The travel expenses and reception fees for the Supervisory Committee members' trip will all be handled in accordance with the established precedent for the registration of Legislative Committee members. According to the latest statistics, there are currently more than 60 new Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing, including Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Zou Lu, and Liu Xin. The total number of Supervisory Committee members is 223, and 168 have been elected, which is more than two-thirds of the total number. According to the preparation procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, it is possible to have a legal convention and convocation.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao Appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan; Central Standing Committee Unanimously Agrees; Kuomintang Legislative Committee Members Also Support</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the decision to appoint Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan was made at the President's official residence on the evening of the 23rd, President Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as the Director-General of the Kuomintang, specially convened a meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the morning of the 24th to first seek consent within the party. The Central Standing Committee was held at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, with the Director-General personally presiding. He reported on the spot that he had decided to nominate Weng Wenhao as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, and specially sought the opinions of the members. Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, Li Zonghuang and others stood up and spoke, saying that although Weng's appointment as the head of the Executive Yuan was not entirely ideal, there was no more suitable candidate at present, so they should follow the Director-General's intention, but they hoped that after Weng took office, he could bring a new atmosphere to the future new Executive Yuan. Finally, it was put to a vote, and all the members unanimously stood up and passed it, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Kuomintang Director-General Chiang Kai-shek convened a discussion meeting with Kuomintang Legislative Committee members at the Central Party Headquarters at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th to discuss the issue of nominating Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan. More than 200 Legislative Committee members attended the meeting. Director-General Chiang Kai-shek arrived at the meeting at 2:40 p.m. and delivered a speech explaining the reasons for nominating Mr. Weng. The Director-General pointed out that Mr. Weng is a well-known scholar with international reputation, has presided over economic construction for many years, and has made many contributions. He has also served as Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan and has rich administrative experience. Since entering politics, he has never participated in factions. He is known for his integrity and self-discipline, which is well known at home and abroad. In the past, public opinion from all sides has criticized the government's corruption and incompetence. Now, appointing a scientist and an honest person as the head of the Executive Yuan may change the atmosphere in the officialdom and international perception. At the beginning of this constitutional era, Mr. Weng is probably a more suitable candidate. The Director-General also earnestly instructed that at this time of hardship, the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan cannot be vacant for a long time. A nomination must be decided quickly, approved by the Legislative Yuan, and a new Executive Yuan must be organized to carry out government affairs. Therefore, he hoped that all the members would appreciate this and support him. The Director-General's speech lasted for ten minutes, and his words were earnest, and all the Legislative Committee members were moved. Zhou Yongneng, Kong Geng, Liu Jianqun and others then spoke one after another, believing that Mr. Weng's knowledge was profound and his experience was rich. If he took office as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he would be able to perform the job well and would express his admiration for the Director-General's intention and resolutely support him. All the members unanimously applauded and agreed, and the meeting adjourned at 3:10 p.m.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi and Xu Fulin Express Opinions</h3>
<p>Believing That Weng Wenhao is Suitable to be Head of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party said on the evening of the 24th that he believed that President's nomination of Weng Wenhao as Premier was very suitable. Mr. Xu believed that Mr. Weng was knowledgeable and meticulous in his work, and was a rare talent in the Kuomintang. Regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the Executive Yuan, Mr. Xu said that he had not yet considered it because the issue of the Legislative Yuan had not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Zeng Qi, leader of the Chinese Youth Party, issued a statement, saying: "I am very pleased that Mr. Weng Wenhao is forming a cabinet. First, because he is a pure scholar and his attitude is usually very fair, he will definitely be able to accommodate all streams and expand the foundation of the government. Second, because he has made achievements in construction in the past, he will definitely be able to make good use of American aid and carry out large-scale construction to deal with the unlimited destruction of the Communist Party. President Chiang's proposal of Mr. Weng and the Legislative Yuan's happy agreement are all wise moves, and we will wait and see. Mr. Weng's "new policies" and "new lineup" are due to the people's eager hope for governance, and there is really no room for further delays. The implementation of the Constitution is like the "finale," and Mr. Weng will definitely have something to satisfy the audience's expectations."</p>
<h3>President Attends Memorial Week; Chen Xueping Reports on Student Unrest</h3>

<p>[Our Report] The newly appointed President Yu Hongjun, who also serves as the President of the Central Bank, officially took office at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Li Ming, Xu Jihu and people from all walks of life in the city came to the Central Bank to congratulate him, no less than 200 people, and the flower baskets were displayed everywhere, creating a great occasion. The ceremony was held at 10:15 a.m. Zhang Jia'ao introduced the Central Bank's executives to the newly appointed President Yu in the president's office. President Yu then gave a 20-minute speech, stating that there would be no changes in the personnel of the bank and hoped that everyone would work with peace of mind to promote and implement various policies. After the ceremony, the guests congratulated him one after another; President Yu also received reporters in the conference room and issued a written statement. In addition to praising the achievements of the former President Zhang, he also said that "the current legal tender reserves are substantial, and the government will hold a large amount of materials sufficient to stabilize the value of the currency," etc.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Control Policy Has Been Effective</h3>
<p>Still Should Follow National Policy for Handling</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yu answered the following questions from reporters yesterday:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding foreign exchange, the government will adopt a control policy. The work promoted by the past Balance Fund Committee has been quite effective. In the future, we should still follow the national policy and deal with the facts in accordance with the circumstances. If there are any improvements that need to be made, I will humbly accept them and review them as much as possible. (2) Regarding stabilizing prices, we should of course treat both the symptoms and the root causes, such as tightening credit and selling materials. In addition, the government has indeed developed new and effective methods, which will be implemented immediately. (3) The Northeast Circulation Certificates were initially adapted to the needs, and then the opinions of the people in the Northeast were adopted to stop them and redeem them. The redemption method has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the legal tender prepared for the redemption has been shipped outside the customs to start the redemption. The main purpose is to seek the stability of the Northeast's finance and the psychology of its people. (4) The short-term treasury bills were issued not long ago and have also achieved considerable results. If local financial figures offer good opinions, they should of course be adopted and improved. (5) Regarding personnel issues, national talents should serve the country. The Central Bank is a business organization, and it is especially inappropriate to be affected by the difference in the person in charge, so there will be no changes in the personnel of the bank.</p>
<h3>Yu and Wu Discuss Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>Central Bank Personnel Remain Largely Unchanged</p>
<p>After the reception, Yu and Mayor Wu Guozhen discussed the issue of price stabilization. Then, Yu met with Deputy President Liu Gongyun to inquire about the bank's business and personnel, and left the bank and returned to his residence at 12:30 p.m. Yu returned to the bank to work at 3:00 p.m. and received Yu Shuping, director of the City Police Department.</p>
<p>According to our reporter, regarding the future personnel of the Central Bank, it is heard that Deputy President Liu Gongyun has dispelled his intention to resign, and there may be changes in the position of director of the Business Bureau in the future. Also, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Equalization Committee, had the intention to leave before Zhang Jia'ao resigned. It is rumored that Xu Baiyuan will take over the position of chairman in the future. As for the future policies of the National Bank, in addition to controlling the financial market and stabilizing prices, the other major financial plans and the planning of the use of American aid and other plans will have to wait until the new cabinet is established before a final decision can be made.</p>

<h3>Mr. Weng Wenhao's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Weng Wenhao, courtesy name Yongni, was born in 1889 in Shitang Village, Yin County, Zhejiang Province. At the age of eighteen, he came to Shanghai and entered Aurora University for his studies. In 1908, Mr. Weng passed the Zhejiang government-funded examination and went to Europe to study at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, researching geology. He was highly regarded by his teachers and obtained a doctorate in science. After returning to China one year before the founding of the Republic of China, he traveled to various places for research and compiled the book "China's Mineral Resources Map." Subsequently, he co-founded the Geological Survey Institute in Beiping with Ding Wenjiang, Zhang Hongzhao, and others. From 1922, he succeeded Ding Wenjiang as the director of the Beiping Geological Survey Institute. During this period, he also served as the counselor of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and concurrently as a professor at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University, as well as acting president of Tsinghua University. He consistently dedicated himself to research in geology and geography, making significant contributions. He attended conferences such as the International Geological Congress and the Pacific Science Congress as a representative, and served as the president of the Geological Society of China and the president of the Chinese Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. He also received honorary doctorates of law from the University of British Columbia in Canada and honorary doctorates of engineering from the Berlin Institute of Technology in Germany. In modern China, the academic field that first attracted international academic attention was earth science, which was all the result of Mr. Weng's past research.</p>
<p>In 1935, Mr. Weng was appointed Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; later, he also served as Secretary-General of the National Defense Design Committee and the Resources Committee. In 1937, he was reassigned as Minister of the Third Department of the Military Affairs Commission. During the coronation of the British monarch, Mr. Weng and Kong Xiangxi were both envoys of China, attending the grand ceremony in the UK and visiting the UK, the US, France, Germany and other countries.</p>
<p>In 1938, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was established, and Mr. Weng was transferred to the position of Minister of Economic Affairs, concurrently serving as Chairman of the Resources Committee, Director of the Factory Adjustment Office, and Director of the Wartime Production Bureau, contributing significantly to the development of rear-area resources for the anti-Japanese war. In 1942, Mr. Weng inspected various places in the Northwest, planning the development of industrial and mining enterprises. In January 1944, the National Government awarded him the First Class Jingxing Medal. In 1945, at the First Plenary Session of the Sixth Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, he was elected as a member of the National Government and concurrently as Vice President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng remained a scholar at heart even after serving in government for more than ten years. After the victory, he traveled extensively for the restoration and takeover of industrial and mining enterprises. After 1946, he resigned from his position as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and devoted himself to industry and mining, aiming to restore various production enterprises to their former state.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng has authored many books, among which "China's Mineral Resources" and "China's Earthquakes" are particularly respected by the international academic community. In 1933, during the 60th anniversary of the "Shen Bao" newspaper, Mr. Weng, together with Ding Wenjiang and Zeng Shiying, co-edited the "New Map of the Republic of China," which was meticulously selected, accurately drawn, and remains an authoritative work among Chinese maps to this day. Recently, "Shen Bao" planned to revise and republish the map, and Mr. Weng, despite his government affairs, still undertook the work of revising and redrawing the map for "Shen Bao," demonstrating his dedication to academics even while serving in government, which is truly rare. The book, after Mr. Weng's revision, is expected to be published within the year and meet the readers.</p>
<p>In 1933, Mr. Weng had a car accident in Wukang County on his way from Hangzhou to Nanjing, and his face was injured. Visible scars remain on his face to this day.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng's father, named Mianfu, is now seventy-eight years old. During the late Qing Dynasty, he was a reformer who resolutely sent his only son to a foreign country to seek knowledge, demonstrating remarkable insight.</p>
<p>Mr. Weng has four sons. His youngest son, Qinhan, originally served in the Air Force and died in the line of duty in 1944. (The left is Mr. Weng's signature style.)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the New Cabinet's Future</h3>
<p>The difficult-to-produce Premier of the Executive Yuan was finally nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan yesterday. The person responsible for forming the cabinet is Mr. Weng Wenhao. Mr. Weng was well-known in academic circles before the war. He participated in government affairs and was responsible for developing resources. During the War of Resistance, he presided over the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Wartime Production Bureau. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he served as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and is currently the Chairman of the Resources Committee. In the eyes of the general public, Mr. Weng is undoubtedly a person with ambition, vision, and the ability to make a difference. Although Mr. Weng is a Central Committee member of the Kuomintang, his scholarly demeanor suggests that he can be regarded as a liberal, no different from social elites. Today, when people are eagerly hoping for good governance, it is appropriate to have Mr. Weng Wenhao take on this arduous task, organize an Executive Yuan under the Constitution that assumes joint responsibility, and implement new policies, which should meet the expectations of people at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The new Premier of the Executive Yuan is the first Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution in our country. According to the provisions of the Constitution, he must be nominated by the President and appointed with the approval of the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the President carefully considered the candidates for Premier. It is said that the President initially favored Premier Zhang Qun, but Premier Zhang, considering the nation's urgent desire for new people to implement new policies, was unwilling to be reappointed and even left Beijing for Chongqing to show his determination. The President then favored General He Yingqin, who had just returned from abroad, but General He declined the important task, citing "having been away from the country for nearly two years and not being familiar with the domestic political situation." As a result, the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan could not be decided for a time. The President then used the weekend holiday to consider the matter all day and finally decided to entrust the task of organizing the cabinet to Mr. Weng Wenhao. Yesterday, Mr. Weng's nomination was reportedly submitted to the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee for public resolution, which was passed. In the afternoon, the official document was formally submitted to the Legislative Yuan, which was also passed by the third meeting of the Yuan with 489 votes in favor and 94 against. Observing the difficulty in producing the Premier of the Executive Yuan and observing the newly nominated Mr. Weng's morality, writing, talent, knowledge, and vision, we not only deeply congratulate our country's democratic constitutional future for finding the right person, but also wish to take advantage of Premier Weng's commencement of cabinet formation to offer some opinions to express our hopes for the political situation in the future.</p>
<p>First, the essence of the responsible cabinet system lies in the thorough implementation of policies. Whether policies can be thoroughly implemented depends first on whether there are policies, second on whether the policies have been agreed upon by the people's representatives, and then on the results of the policy implementation. Therefore, after Mr. Weng is ordered to form a cabinet, he must first prepare his policy guidelines. We believe that future policy guidelines should avoid empty rhetoric and should be pragmatic. The Constitution of our country has a chapter on basic national policies, which already has principled provisions for national defense, diplomacy, national economy, social security, culture, education, and border policies. Therefore, what is currently needed is not a hollow article, but rather practical measures to address current malpractices and the determination to implement these measures. We believe that under the current circumstances, as a certain authority figure said, two major policies must be implemented immediately: one is the rapid promotion of the military suppression of the rebellion, so as to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion in the shortest possible time; and the other is the effective economic measures, such as how to use US aid, how to stabilize finance, and how to improve the national economy and the people's livelihood. All of these should be brainstormed and implemented with determination. To be honest, today the people of the whole country are living in dire straits, almost unable to breathe. For two months, government affairs have been lax, almost at a standstill, while the communist bandits have taken the opportunity to expand the riots, running amok. If the new government does not quickly form and step up to take on the important task, how can the people live on? "A thirsty person easily takes a drink, and a hungry person easily takes food." Today, when the people are struggling to survive, as long as the government loves and protects the people and relieves their suffering, it is not an unsolvable problem. What is needed is for leadership figures with scholarly demeanor to transform into a new style of "responsible" governance. From the Premier of the Executive Yuan himself to the heads of various ministries and commissions, they must have the democratic demeanor of new politicians. They must not only humbly accept the people's criticism, but also have the spirit of readily adopting good ideas and taking responsibility for their work. Whether they do well or poorly, they must never shirk responsibility. This is the most basic meaning of a responsible cabinet. Only with this spirit can politics be reformed and can there be progress.</p>
<p>Second, the most peculiar thing about the political situation in recent years is the revolving door of political figures. It seems that in a country as large as China, only this group of people can be loyal and effective for the country. As for their ability and political achievements, they are already well-known. Therefore, since today we are touting new people and new policies, the selection of heads of various ministries and commissions and political committee members regardless of departments and commissions should be based on the principle of "appointing people based on merit," eliminating all partisan prejudices, and truly "serving the public," promoting talent without adhering to seniority. Only in this way can new talent be discovered. Foreign and domestic political commentators often say that the government's reorganizations are "new wine in old bottles." If we are still unwilling to employ new people to give the government a new look, and if we are still unwilling to select a few young politicians who are strong, energetic, and insightful to add vitality to the government, how can we expect the government to become "competent"? After the war, the British Labor Party formed a cabinet and employed a large number of new people, maintaining the vitality of the Labor Party government, which can be used as a reference for Premier Weng in selecting the heads of various ministries and commissions. In the past, the Executive Yuan was responsible to the Chairman of the National Government and was also a coalition government organized by the Kuomintang and the Democratic Youth Party. However, the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution is a responsible cabinet accountable to the Legislative Yuan. The issues that should be paid attention to are less political issues and more constitutional issues. Therefore, regardless of whether Premier Weng still intends to recruit figures from the Democratic Youth Party to participate in the Executive Yuan, he should emphasize the talents of the people he chooses to join the cabinet and take charge of any ministry or commission, and he should also emphasize whether their political views are in line with Premier Weng's policy guidelines. In other words, cabinet members should be asked about their talent, not their party affiliation. We believe that only in this way can we organize a "competent" government that meets the ardent expectations of the people.</p>
<p>Third, in today's serious and difficult military situation of suppressing the rebellion, we need a strong government, a government with high-speed administrative efficiency. We never hope to produce a weak and incompetent government, a perfunctory government. The new Executive Yuan must be loyal to the Constitution. Whether it is a major plan for domestic or foreign affairs, it must be carried out in accordance with this Constitution. What we must pay close attention to is the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan has the power to legislate, the power to approve, and the power to question the important policies of the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan and only has the power to return for reconsideration. Comparing the two powers, it is obviously impossible to achieve the effect of "check and balance." Since the Executive Yuan is subject to many constraints, many people regard the Premier of the Executive Yuan as a daunting task. However, when we study the legislative spirit of the Chinese Constitution, its essence lies in the division of powers and functions. The people should have full power, and the government should have full capacity. If we only focus on the literal interpretation, the Executive Yuan will ask the Legislative Yuan for consent in everything, and everyone from the Premier of the Executive Yuan downwards will only know how to perfunctorily deal with the Legislative Yuan, holding the idea that "the more you do, the more mistakes you make, the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make, and the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make, and the less you do, the better." Everyone is sloppy and muddled through the day, then the government will inevitably become a paralyzed and incompetent government. Otherwise, even if it勉强 comes to power at the beginning, it will soon retreat in the face of difficulty. If the Premier of the Executive Yuan is frequently changed, not only will the political situation not be stable, but also no policy can be thoroughly implemented. This kind of political system is definitely not what our people expect. Therefore, we want the Executive and Legislative Yuans to understand the spirit of our country's Constitution. The Executive Yuan must value its policies and implement them with a strong spirit. The Legislative Yuan can only hold the Executive Yuan accountable for its policies, rather than constantly hindering the Executive Yuan in small matters. Only in this way can we hope that the government will gradually become a strong and powerful government with high efficiency in the future.</p>

<h3>Tool Needed to Manufacture Nitric Acid, Seven Jin of Platinum Wire Mesh, Stolen from Our Yongli Factory by the Japanese, Allied Forces Dedicated to Searching and Returning It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Allied Forces are currently dedicated to searching for seven jin of platinum wire mesh (each jin equals sixteen liang). This item originally belonged to Yongli Chemical Factory, the largest acid factory in our country. It was stolen by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of the factory during the war. Recently, the factory was returned to our country by Japan, but it still lacks this important platinum wire mesh contact agent for nitric acid manufacturing, and therefore cannot produce it. The Japanese government initially agreed to re-manufacture it to compensate our country, but because all precious metals are under the control of the Allied Forces, it must first obtain their approval. It is reported that Shang Zhen, head of our delegation to Japan, and Wu Bannong, head of the compensation and restitution delegation, have separately written to the Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces and Major General Tangxi, Director of the Property Supervision Office, requesting to search for the above-mentioned platinum wire mesh. If there are no results, they should allow the opening of the necessary platinum so that the Japanese government can re-manufacture it.</p>

<h3>British Overseas Troop Levels Unchanged, Defense Plans Revised, Britain Finds Its Position in the Middle East Quite Difficult</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Military observers here say that although the British military's withdrawal from India, Burma, and Palestine in 1947 and 1948 will profoundly affect Britain's global strategy, Britain's overall military responsibilities will not decrease as a result. The goal of reducing military personnel to 700,000 remains, and overseas troop deployments will not be reduced substantially. Defense Minister Alexander told the House of Commons last October that the total number of military personnel at the time was 940,000, which would be reduced by 224,000 in twelve months. These reductions are all normal post-war demobilization; not only will the number of standing troops not decrease, but the number of regular troops will increase slightly. Alexander also said at the time that about one-third of Britain's total troops were stationed overseas. This proportion remains unchanged today. Therefore, if the total number of troops in peacetime is 700,000, the number of army, navy, and air force personnel stationed overseas is about 220,000, which is a significant increase compared to the pre-war overseas troop levels. Strategically speaking, although the nature of British military strategy overseas has changed due to the independence of some colonies, its scope has not diminished. This is due to the unstable global situation after the war. The focus of British defense is currently on the Middle East, Western Europe, and maritime communication lines to its respective territories. The defense of India and Pakistan is no longer directly controlled by Britain. In future wars, Britain can only use political means to obtain deployment rights on the Indian Ocean coast or ensure that India supports Britain in combat or remains strictly neutral. Britain's position in the Middle East is also quite difficult. The abandonment of Palestine has caused it to lose a major base in the Middle East, and whether the Suez Canal Zone can be secured depends on the outcome of British-Egyptian negotiations. Therefore, Britain's future position in the Middle East and its oil supply lines depend on Britain consolidating its friendly alliance treaties with Arab countries and establishing several new bases near Arab countries, such as Malta, Cyprus, and East African Kenya. The East African base is still under construction, and its location is central, at the heart of the East and West and the Middle East, making it a suitable base for any pincer tactics. In Europe, the establishment of the Western European Union has inevitably increased Britain's military responsibilities in Europe compared to before the war. Due to the concentration of the British defense system in Europe and the Middle East, the defense of the autonomous territories will gradually be handed over to the autonomous territories themselves. However, in the event of a major war, the autonomous territories will find it difficult to resist strong enemies on their own. When the British Imperial Chief of Staff visited various territories last year, he had already drafted a common defense plan for the British Commonwealth.</p>
<h3>British Autonomous Territories Celebrate Empire Day, Express Loyalty to the Motherland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cape Town, 24th] South African Prime Minister Smuts broadcast on Empire Day on the 24th, saying that the British Commonwealth is the most successful experiment in world government. In a world divided by fear, Western countries can only re-draft their plans. The United States must occupy a special position in the task of organizing the West. The union of the United States and the British Commonwealth can restrain any strong enemy. The unity of Western Europe is essential and may turn Europe's tragedy into a great achievement for politicians.</p>

<h3>Wallace Opposes U.S. Economic Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 23rd] U.S. Third Party presidential candidate Wallace spoke in Spokane, Washington, last night, demanding that the leaders of the U.S. bipartisan foreign policy hold a series of debates. Wallace also said, "We will prove that the U.S. policy in Germany and Japan violates every single aspect of what was announced during the war.

<h3>Vitamin B-Enriched White Rice Can Prevent Beriberi, Art Students and Officials Are Conducting Research</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Saicedo, director of the nutrition team at the U.S. Public Health Office in the Philippines, said that he hopes to obtain $25,000 as funding for the Philippines' white rice nutrition enhancement program.

It is said that they are waiting for the results of the experiment. If the experiment is successful, they will introduce this vitamin-enriched white rice to China, India and other regions for trial use to reduce millions of cases of beriberi.</p>
<h3>Turkey Decides to Strengthen Cooperation with the United States to Safeguard the Peace of the Eastern Mediterranean, Hopes for a Fair Resolution of the Holy Land Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 23rd] Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak delivered a speech at a political party conference in Sivas today, emphasizing that the joint efforts of the United States and Turkey to safeguard peace in the Eastern Mediterranean region are gradually increasing. The United States is well aware that the defense of the Atlantic Ocean begins in the Eastern Mediterranean. The United States' efforts to strengthen Turkey's defense forces and maintain peace are continuing, and it is hoped that this assistance will continue in the future.</p>
<p>Turkey itself is now devoting half of its limited resources to national defense as the most reliable guarantee of freedom and independence. The rumor that U.S. aid undermines Turkey's independence is definitely untrue. Sadak also said that the recent U.S. proposal to Moscow to discuss the resolution of differences shows that the United States has no intention of aggression against the Soviet Union. The U.S. government has assured Turkey that its proposal to the Soviet Union to discuss bilateral differences does not in any way indicate that U.S. policy in the Mediterranean and Middle East will change. Sadak further said, "We must acknowledge that the dramatic changes in the Palestinian situation have hindered the establishment of peace and stability in the Middle East. We sincerely hope that the bloodshed will no longer continue and will not create a permanent factor of turmoil and unrest, in order to achieve a lasting solution that allows the Arab people to be the masters of their rights. Turkey's policy is peace, and Turkey is always prepared to establish the most friendly relations and cooperation with countries that share our ideas and goals. However, if it involves Turkey's own freedom and independence, Turkey will never agree to compromise."</p>

<h3>Japan May Receive U.S. Credit Loan This Year of $750 Million. Prime Minister Ashida Announces in Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 24th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida told the House of Representatives Budget Committee today that Japan will receive a $750 million credit loan this year. This loan will include the recent $60 million cotton credit loan, a revolving fund totaling $150 million, and a portion of the $100 million reconstruction fund allocated to Japan and Korea. However, Ashida warned questioning legislators that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen must first regulate the production increase and trade balance before this loan can be obtained. Ashida finally announced that after Japan's surrender, in addition to the considerable number of Japanese people who have already left Japan for other countries, in the near future, South American countries, New York, and other regions will also allow the immigration of a large number of Japanese nationals.</p>
<h3>German Communists Launch Petition Drive, Calling for Petitions for German Unification. Disturbances Occur in U.S. and French Occupation Zones</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The Communist-controlled German People's Congress launched a plebiscite today to decide on the question of German unification. Many disputes occurred throughout the day, and police used batons to disperse the crowds. According to the German news agency registered with the Soviet authorities, police in the U.S. sector of Berlin attacked the crowds. At the Schoenborn military station in the U.S. sector, U.S. military police dismantled ballot boxes. Police in the French sector of Berlin also took similar action. The U.S. and French authorities in Berlin have banned personnel from the "People's Congress" from collecting opinion votes from households. The British authorities did not prohibit it, but issued a statement stating that the move was "completely superfluous." The atmosphere in the eastern and western parts of Berlin today was completely different. The western part, occupied by Western countries, was still like a normal Sunday, with few pedestrians on the streets and all agencies with closed iron gates. The Soviet zone in the east was covered with red flags and slogans, instructing people to sign opinion forms to exercise this democratic right. Young workers paraded in the streets on trucks, shouting slogans such as "No Marshall Aid." Personnel from the "People's Congress" visited residents door-to-door, urging them to support this signature drive and petition the occupying powers to declare Germany an "indivisible democratic republic."</p>

The list of recruited personnel and the reporting date will be temporarily announced in the newspaper by the Joint Service General Headquarters. Once the recruitment is announced, except for those with disabilities or chronic illnesses who must have valid supporting documents to apply for exemption, the rest must report to the designated location within one month, otherwise they will be punished according to law and dealt with . The service period is tentatively set at one year. Travel expenses to the post will be approved and issued by the Military Medical Department. When recruited students are demobilized and retired, they will be granted three months' salary by the serving agency where they are located at the time, as demobilization travel expenses. The medical community in this city is paying close attention to the implementation of this new law, and general opinion is that there are many difficulties.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Monks in Shanghai Face a Threat to Their Livelihoods. Transient Troops Occupy Temples. Buddhist Association Petitions Authorities</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association recently convened a meeting of directors and supervisors because several member temples in the city are often occupied by transient troops, affecting Buddhist services and threatening the livelihoods of thousands of monks. The meeting decided to list the reasons and send representatives to petition the municipal government, the transient military comfort association, the port headquarters, and the Joint Logistics Supply Bureau, respectively. The important reasons stated: (1) The number of free schools, clinics, hospitals, and porridge distribution centers run by temples is quite large, and the expenses are huge, all relying on income from Buddhist services. (2) Recently, a large number of monks and nuns fleeing from Northeast, North China, and Northern Jiangsu to Shanghai have been provided with relief by various temples. (3) Water and electricity supply is difficult, and the consumption has increased sharply, and the temples are unable to pay, and the lack of sanitary facilities in the temples affects health and is a cause for concern. (4) Buddhism is one of the religions, and temples and churches should receive the same protection. (5) The temple houses in this city mostly have lease relationships, and all pay land rent and taxes, and should enjoy the same rights as civil houses. (6) With troops stationed in the temples, there are no Buddhist services at all. According to a member of the branch, the responsible authorities have agreed to gradually clear the troops stationed in various temples after the closing ceremony of the 7th National Games. However, it is heard that temples such as Jade Buddha, Longhua, and Guo'en have not yet been cleared, so it is still hoped that the relevant authorities will actively assist in evacuating them in order to solve the difficulties of the various temples.</p>

<h3>Strictly Restrain Soldiers, Only Allowed to Watch Plays with Tickets, Military and Political Authorities Invite Theater Representatives for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The military and political authorities in this city, due to the continuous disputes between some soldiers watching plays without tickets and the theaters in recent days, specially invited various theaters in this city to a discussion at the Municipal Government at 4 pm yesterday. During the meeting, theater representatives expressed that they do not discriminate against soldiers, and they are willing to do their best for all matters of entertainment, fundraising, or comfort. The continuous occurrence of disputes should be guaranteed by the authorities. After exchanging views, it was decided that in the future, matters of comforting soldiers will be strengthened. On the one hand, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, and Chairman Fang will come forward to invite the leaders of various military and police units stationed in Shanghai within days, and ask their subordinates to strictly abide by discipline. According to Fang Qiatan, in order to solve this problem, in the future, only soldiers holding complimentary tickets will be allowed to enter the venue to watch plays, otherwise they will not be released. The government will guarantee the survival of the theaters, and it is hoped that the heads of each unit will strictly restrain their subordinates and maintain military discipline.</p>
<h3>Theater Does Not Pay Tax Payment, Judicial Authorities Say It Cannot Be Regarded as Justified</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The major theaters in this city, due to the disturbances caused by soldiers watching plays without tickets, have greatly affected their business. After gathering to discuss, in addition to requesting the municipal government to thoroughly guarantee the safety of the theaters, they will also deposit the entertainment tax collected on behalf of the government in the municipal bank. Before obtaining a reliable security measure, they refuse to submit it to the Finance Bureau. A reporter visited the judicial authorities in this city yesterday and inquired about this matter. The judicial authorities made a solemn statement on this matter: it is considered that paying taxes is the obligation of the people. The entertainment tax collected by the theater was originally collected on behalf of the government. Now, the taxpayers (audience) have already paid the tax, and the theater cannot resist paying this tax as a requirement for obtaining security. Military disturbances are certainly inappropriate, but they can appeal to the relevant authorities. It cannot be regarded as a legitimate reason to demand security by resisting the payment of taxes.</p>
<h3>Can be Enforced if Over the Limited Period</h3>
<p>Regarding this move by the theaters, the Finance Bureau can, after each theater exceeds the payment deadline set by the Finance Bureau, send it to the District Court for ruling in accordance with financial regulations. Once the ruling is made, the District Court will execute it. If the District Court's deadline for payment and penalty is exceeded, the District Court can seal the house and enforce it. As for the theaters' appeal, the District Court can still enforce it during the appeal period, and the theaters must not delay the payment date on the pretext of the appeal.</p>

According to definite information: the incident of the Gong Wutai being destroyed the other day has nothing to do with the soldiers and officers of Aviation Engineering Maintenance.</p>
<h3>Two General-Ranked Japanese War Criminals Tried and Concluded, Fukuda Still Equivocates, Military Tribunal Scheduled to Pronounce Sentence at Month's End</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The military tribunal, presided over by Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, yesterday held a public trial of Vice Admiral Fukuda Ryosaburo, Fleet Commander of the Japanese war criminal class, and Major General Miyagawa Kiyosaburo, Commander of the 40th Division. As is customary with all Japanese war criminals, both criminals equivocated and offered specious defenses regarding the crimes they committed, which were rigorously refuted by the prosecutor. Following the conclusion of the arguments, the sentencing was scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 31st of this month.</p>
<h3>During the Invasion of China, Their Heinous Crimes Were Obvious</h3>
<p>Fukuda Ryosaburo is a graduate of the Japanese Naval Academy, having served as captain of the Japanese Combined Fleet and captain of the Qingyang warship, and was an active member of the Japanese naval community. At the time when Japan's policy of invading China matured, he violated international covenants and participated in the war of aggression against China. Subsequently, he colluded with Wang Jingwei, the leading Chinese traitor, betrayed his motherland, with the intention of destroying China's unity and weakening its resistance efforts. After the establishment of Wang’s puppet regime, starting from May of the 30th year of the Republic of China, under the command of Konoe Fumimaro who concurrently served as the Director of the Asia Development Board, Fukuda assumed the position of the head of the Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, with the purpose of controlling the puppet regime in South China, and training traitorous spies to infiltrate Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian Province, carrying out extensive activities to fulfill their intention of enslaving and eliminating the Chinese nation. On November 30th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to the position of Commander of the Taiwan Merchant Fleet, controlling over a thousand aircraft, which constantly flew to bomb the rear areas of China, indiscriminately bombing both defended and undefended cities, in order to kill the Chinese people. On May 15th of the 34th year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to the position of Commander of the Shanghai Chinese Fleet, and allowed his subordinates to steal over four hundred tons of I-beams, water-flow iron, and wire rod and other steel products stockpiled by the Huade Trading Company in the Gonghexiang Wharf warehouse.</p>
<p>Miyagawa Kiyosaburo is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy, and before the war served as a staff officer of the Shimonoseki Fortress and Principal of the Army Ordnance School, among other positions.</p>
<p>He came to China in the 31st year of the Republic of China, initially serving as the Chief of Ordnance of the North China Area Army and the General Headquarters of the Expeditionary Army. In August of the 32nd year, he was promoted to the commander of the 40th Division. After the Changheng Campaign in the 33rd year, he led his troops to attack Guilin. Passing through the border of Xing'an County, from Xishan and Rongjiang, he ordered his subordinates to massacre defenseless elderly and civilians, rape women, plunder property, and burn houses. When the division first entered the urban area of Guilin and the Daxie Caoping area from the east side of Guilin, it forcibly abducted dozens of women and provided them to its military members for rape and amusement outside the Lizemen General’s Office. In Xintian Village, a man named Qin was subjected to torture and had his genitals cut off. On February 14th of the 34th year, the division transferred from Guilin to Guangdong, passing through Shixing, ordering his subordinates to rob Rev. Liu Zhenying's Gospel Hall of clocks, jewelry, clothing, and 20,000 yuan in cash. The next day, they set fire to the houses and pushed porters brought from Nanxiong into the fire, burning their chests. When the division retreated from Yongning, Guangxi, passing through Qinzhou, Guangdong, it also ordered its subordinates to rob, rape, massacre, and destroy property.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Allocates Funds to Aid the Poor Affected by the Yanping Road Fire</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A total of 371 poor households and 1,863 disaster victims were affected by the major fire on Yanping Road on April 18th. Wu Zhongda, the chief of the Jiangning District, and the Municipal Council requested relief from the municipal government, which has now been approved by the mayor and allocated 400 million yuan for relief, to be distributed equally according to the number of disaster victims. At the same time, Wu Zhongda, the chief of Jiangning District, raised 50 million yuan, and the Jianghuai Fellow Association in Shanghai also donated 400 million yuan, totaling 850 million yuan. The Municipal Relief Association has scheduled to send staff member Liu Mingyuan this Saturday, together with Chief Wu and representatives of the Jianghuai Fellow Association, to carry the funds to Jinjia Lane on Yanping Road for joint distribution, with an average of 460,000 yuan per disaster victim.</p>
<h3>District Chief Reprimanded with Major Demerit for Holding Back ID Cards</h3>
<p>Wu Zhongda, the chief of Jiangning District, previously withheld 3,659,500 yuan in national ID card processing fees collected from the various security units under his jurisdiction from December of last year to April of this year without a valid reason, and the accountant of the district office, Jin Hanqing, embezzled the funds. After the relevant department of the Bureau of Civil Affairs learned of this, considering that the national ID card is related to local security and is extremely important, District Chief Wu was deemed to have neglected his duties, and his staff members embezzled public funds, which was deemed highly inappropriate. He was reprimanded with a major demerit to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Litigation Case Over Land Dispute Involving Refugees: Defendant Ordered to Post Bail During Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Tonggeng, residing at No. 1, Lane 82, Subei New Village, Xietu Road, this city, was previously accused by 192 residents of the village, Subei refugees including Li Guangjiao, of intending to obtain illegitimate wealth by implementing public intimidation and endangering public safety, requesting a lawsuit. According to the complaint: They were all refugees who fled from Subei to Shanghai and built shacks on barren land on Xietu Road in May of the 35th year to provide shelter. At that time, the original landlord expressed deep sympathy and did not prevent them from doing so. Unexpectedly, after the base was leveled and developed into a village, the adjacent Qinkong Rubber Factory invested in purchasing the land, intending to put the refugees back in the miserable situation of sleeping in the open and eating in the wind. Li Guangqian and others jointly submitted a document to the Executive Yuan for relief, and officials were sent to investigate and stop the factory. The Qinkong Rubber Factory realized that it was difficult and retreated. Unexpectedly, Zhang Tonggeng, who also claimed to be a refugee and lived in a house on the same base, thought of seizing ill-gotten wealth and colluded with Qinkong, threatening and intimidating the residents of the village, saying that he could demolish the houses for the Qinkong factory, or secretly set fire to them, and making all kinds of threats. Yesterday, the District Prosecutor's Office summoned Zhang Tonggeng and conducted an investigation on suspicion of intimidation. At the end of the court session, he was ordered to provide a shop guarantee and a family guarantee, and the interrogation was rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Poppy Pods Can Substitute for Opium, All Seized from Pharmacies, Liu Xuehai Discusses Three Major Anti-Smoking Efforts</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "163" Anti-Smoking Day is approaching, and the municipal government is preparing to expand the commemoration on a grand scale because this is the first Anti-Smoking Day after the implementation of the constitution.

According to him: In addition to burning a large amount of opium at this year's Anti-Smoking Day, a large number of poppy pods will also be burned. Because many smokers use poppy pods as a substitute after quitting smoking, starting this year, poppy pods have been listed as prohibited items. The police station has confiscated 40,000 to 50,000 catties of poppy pods from various pharmacies, which will be publicly burned at that time, and the Central Film Studio will be asked to take newsreels for commemoration.</p>
<p>According to Special Envoy Liu: Shanghai is a hub for drug manufacturing and trafficking. Drug dealers use sea, land, and air transportation to transport raw materials for drugs to Shanghai, process them, and then transfer them to the mainland. Therefore, if all the opium in Shanghai can be cleared, it is equivalent to clearing half of China's opium.</p>
<p>The Poison of Morphine and Heroin is Hundreds of Times Greater than Opium</p>
<p>According to statistics, more than 300 cases of drug use and trafficking were uncovered in April. After analysis, it was confirmed that there are very few smokers in the upper class in this city, not many in the middle class, and most are in the lower class. Most of what they smoke is not opium, but heroin and morphine, which are hundreds of times more poisonous than opium. According to tests, one hundred taels of opium is equal to one tael of morphine, and one hundred taels of morphine is equal to one tael of heroin. Moreover, heroin can be smoked without opium pipes and lamps, which is convenient for concealment. The three major tasks of the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Association are: (1) Re-testing all smokers who have quit in the past, who often relapse, and implementing random inspections for re-testing. (2) Smokers who have not been tested and are still hiding will be investigated and arrested by the police station and sent to the court for strict punishment. (3) Establishing a joint investigation office, where the police station, the garrison headquarters, and the anti-smoking committee will cooperate with each other, with Police Chief Yu Shuping as the director.</p>
<p>Jointly Exchange Information to Prevent International Smuggling</p>
<p>Special Envoy Liu currently also serves as the director of the Shanghai Office of the Anti-Smoking Committee. The main task of the Shanghai Office is to exchange information on opium smuggling with the United Nations and establish an international smuggling intelligence network. Because the situation of international smuggling has been serious recently, there have been many cases of smuggling from Malaya, India, Burma, and Southeast Asia to Shanghai for sale. For example, 60 kilograms of opium were found on the oil tanker of Meifu Oil Company a few days ago. The Anti-Smoking Committee is now launching a joint investigation office and customs personnel responsible for paying close attention.</p>
<h3>Improper Practices Discovered in Sugar Rationing, 23 Businesses Penalized, Price of Sugar Rationing Unchanged This Period</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Sugar Group of the Price Evaluation Committee held its 33rd meeting yesterday, resolving that: (1) The price of sugar rationing will remain unchanged for this period, but because the market price of refined white sugar fluctuates drastically, it was decided to increase the quota by 50%, and the price will remain the same. (2) The 12th period of household sugar, allocated with extra-grade granular white sugar, will be allocated starting in mid-June, and the allocation price will be discussed at the next meeting.

The evaluation committee, considering that it was their first offense, punished them according to the severity of the circumstances, stopping the allocation for one or two periods and issuing warnings. If they commit the offense again in the future, they will be ordered to permanently close down according to Article 11 of the Measures for Sugar Allocation Based on Population. (4) There is an imbalance between the allocation stores and residents in the Longhua District, and the South Goods Industry Association will reorganize it starting from today.</p>

<p>The Prices of Flour, Grain, Edible Oil Soar</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that under the crazy rise in rice prices in Wuxi, the situation is even more serious than in this city. Cargo owners are unwilling to sell, and the asking price is shocking, and the market is in chaos. In the early market, white japonica rice was once quoted as high as 7 million yuan. Thin rice was 6.95 million. Later, because the authorities limited the price and it could not exceed 5.6 million, the commission was increased by 100,000, and it was strictly stipulated that retail outlets could not exceed 6 million. People's hearts turned. Later, white japonica rice fell to 6.75 million, an increase of 560,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Disputes After the Changning Road Fire: Security Chief and Neighborhood Head Accused and Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, more than 100 disaster victims of the fire at the West Market on Changning Road lined up in front of the District Prosecutor's Office to petition, led by a wooden sign carried by two people, on which the facts of the accusation were written.

Unexpectedly, the security chief Jiang Maozhai and neighborhood head Li Shiyuan embezzled it. When the victims rebuilt their houses, the security chief even extorted them in the name of the Xinjing Police Station, requiring each grass house to pay one dou of rice, and each tiled house to pay two dou of rice, otherwise construction would not be allowed. Therefore, they gathered together to petition the court to file a complaint. Yesterday, Prosecutor Huang Daping summoned Jiang Maozhai, Li Shiyuan, and Jiang Haifa, the owner of the Jinjin restaurant, for questioning. Jiang Haifa denied that he had compensated 1.5 billion yuan, and Jiang Maozhai and Li Shiyuan also denied embezzlement and extortion.

<h3>Mayor Wu Summons Grain Merchants for Talks, Decides on Measures to Suppress and Stabilize Rice Prices, Retail Price Not to Exceed 6 Million Yuan per Shi</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Last week, rice prices in the city fluctuated sharply due to the influence of the production area. Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu telegraphed the Minister of the Grain Ministry to suppress and stabilize prices in the production area, and summoned representatives of the city's rice market, Yin Fuxiang, Hu Wen'an, Gu Yisheng, Cai Shengming, Xu Songren, and representatives of rice stores, Feng Zhenhua and Hu Xianguo, for talks, deciding on two measures: (1) Starting from today, the People's Food Distribution Association will supply 6,000 shi of rice to the market every day, which will be distributed and sold separately according to the required amount of actual sales at each rice store. The supply price is 5.6 million yuan per shi. (2) The retail price of rice stores shall not exceed 6 million yuan per shi. After summoning the rice merchants for talks, the mayor telegraphed the Police Chief to order the subordinates to strictly enforce the rules. Yesterday, warnings were given first. From today onwards, if it is found that the retail price exceeds 6 million yuan, the person in charge will be arrested.</p>
<p>According to the mayor, the city supplies a total of more than 480,000 shi of grain for per capita rationing every month, reaching 63% of the needs of the city's citizens. Now, if another 6,000 shi are supplied every day, it will account for more than 90% of the total needs.</p>
<p>Flour, Grain, and Edible Oil Prices Soar</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that under the crazy rise in rice prices in Wuxi, the situation is even more serious than in this city.

<h3>Local Market News</h3>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 24th] Due to public anxiety, rice prices are volatile and unstable, once again facing a downturn. Black market prices for Bai Geng (polished rice) are close to 7,000,000 yuan, with a limited price of 6,600,000 yuan. Bai Yuan (another type of rice) is priced at 7,600,000 yuan, wheat at 6,300,000 yuan, white wheat at 6,600,000 yuan, flour at 2,200,000 yuan, soybean oil at 1,480,000 yuan, and cotton yarn at 220,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 24th] Rice prices in Suzhou have continued to rise for the past two days. Although the authorities are trying to suppress them, much of the goods are flowing into the black market, and people are optimistic about higher prices, making it difficult to curb the rising trend. Today, the market price for rough rice is 6,150,000 yuan, Bai Geng (polished rice) is 6,900,000 yuan, and door-to-door sales of Bai Mi (polished rice) are priced at 6,600,000 yuan, but the actual selling price has already broken the 7,000,000 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Chengdu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 24th] Chengdu is experiencing a lack of rain, and rice prices are rising again. Shuang Zu (a type of rice) is at 9,280,000 yuan, and miscellaneous grains are generally rising in price. Many poor people in the suburbs of Chengdu are mainly eating vegetable leaves. The municipal government has resumed the Pingxian (price-controlled) distribution system.</p>
<p>Xi'an</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 24th] Grain prices continue to fall. The price of medium-grade wheat has fallen back to 370,000 yuan per dou (unit of volume). The cloth market is quiet, with stable quotations. However, the black market price of gold continues to rise, reaching 74,200,000 yuan per liang (unit of weight).</p>
<h3>Stagnant Tea Exports</h3>
<p>Tea Market for Foreign Firms: Last week, the Wu Chang Tea Company actively negotiated with suppliers for this year's Lu Zhuang Wenzhou Zhenmei tea. A portion of the deal has been completed, with a price of 19,000,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Although the offered prices reflect the principal's optimistic mindset, foreign buyers ultimately find the price too high, and no one is following up. Given this situation, it will be difficult to maintain the current footing. For other varieties, both buyers and sellers are hesitant, and the process is not lively.</p>
<p>The domestic tea market started calmly in the morning, but later became uniformly brisk, especially aged Te Ji Men (a type of black tea), which continued to rise sharply. Due to the high prices of rice and other commodities, sellers of special-grade tea are trying to hold firm. Transactions are limited to sporadic additions on this street, making them as rare as morning stars.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Futures Bidding</h3>
<p>The Yarn Management Committee yesterday (the 24th) still entrusted the China Textile Company to bid on three types of cotton, totaling 2,450 dan. Among them, 900 dan of Tongzhou coarse cotton were sold for 32,600,000 yuan, 350 dan of Hankou coarse cotton were sold for 30,200,000 yuan, and 1,200 dan of Huoji cotton were sold for 31,100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply, Cloth Sales Are Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market benefited from the easing of credit, with ample funds available to the industry. Transactions were frequent, and demand from merchant groups was strong. The market was mainly driven by destocking, and even though Textile Construction put up another auction sign, prices remained firm.</p>
<p>The opening price of 42-count Lan Feng fine yarn in the morning was 5,000,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend, attracting many buyers. Later, due to speculative buying by retail investors, prices rose repeatedly, reaching a closing price of 312,000,000 yuan, a further increase of 12,000,000 yuan from Saturday.</p>
<p>21-count Shuang Ma yarn saw strong destocking and reached a new high of 240,000,000 yuan at the close, a further increase of 10,000,000 yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, from 3,000,000 to 13,500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with news of profitable sales, and various merchant groups adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Actual sales on this street were stagnant, and activity from merchant groups was minimal. The industry, however, was selling off a considerable amount of spot goods.</p>
<p>The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth jumped to 130,000 yuan, but there were few buyers, and the price once declined. However, as the market neared closing, news of rising yarn prices emerged, and the price recovered to a closing price of 7,003,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan from Saturday. The markets for other cloths also stabilized.</p>
<h3>China Trust Adjusts Tung Oil Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau adjusted its purchase prices for tung oil yesterday. The purchase price for the Wuzhou-Shanghai area was raised to 14,500,000 yuan per dan, and the purchase price for the Guangzhou area was set at 15,500,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Bank Advances Exceed Deposits, Underground Interest Rates Decline</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the authorities continued to tighten credit. The combined advances of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury exceeded deposits by 1,448.2 billion yuan, of which over 900 billion yuan was for yarn payments. The market credit remained loose, and underground interest rates have fallen to around 2.7 fen (unit of currency) per yuan. The figures for the advances and deposits of various banks and bureaus yesterday are as follows: Central Bank, advances of 485.1 billion yuan; General Clearing House, deposits of 676.9 billion yuan; Foreign Banks, advances of 178.5 billion yuan; Small Clearing House, deposits of 949.8 billion yuan; Bank of China, advances of 589.8 billion yuan; Bank of Communications, advances of 111 billion yuan; Farmers Bank of China, deposits of 8.1 billion yuan; China Trust Bureau, advances of 217.5 billion yuan; Postal Savings Bureau, deposits of 23.3 billion yuan; Central Cooperative Treasury, advances of 76.2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Qian Zhuang Small Loan Syndicate Further Relaxes Maximum Loan Amount</h3>
<p>The local Qian Zhuang (traditional Chinese banks) jointly formed a small loan syndicate to provide loans to small industrial and commercial enterprises at low interest rates for longer terms. It is reported that the syndicate, in view of the recent rising inflation and to meet the actual needs of general small industrial and commercial enterprises, decided at a general meeting of members to further relax the maximum loan amount to 20,000,000 yuan per household. The syndicate will also try its best to provide financing opportunities for applicants.</p>
<h3>Improving Bank Finances</h3>
<p>Dai Mingli Indicates Three Principles</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of strengthening financial institutions and improving the quality of bank operations, since the Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, Dai Mingli, announced in Shanghai that the Ministry of Finance had consulted with the National Economic Commission to formulate measures, all sectors have expressed concern about this. Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Administration, stated last Saturday that the capital of banks must be increased to at least 50 billion yuan. Recently, reporters learned from Dai Mingli that the improvement of bank quality has now reached a concrete stage. The measures being discussed by the Ministry of Finance and the National Economic Commission may be more flexible than the current measures. It is reported that three principles have now been determined for these measures: the capital of urban banks should be higher than that of inland banks; the capital of banks should be higher than that of Qian Zhuang. Dai also stated that the total capital of banks in urban areas, even at 50 billion yuan, still seems insufficient. For rural banks, around 50 billion yuan should be sufficient to meet current needs.</p>
<h3>Woolen Goods are Quiet Now</h3>
<p>The spot market for woolen goods continues to be quiet. Due to high selling prices, buyers are hesitant. Sales of summer goods are decreasing rather than increasing. Although the market sentiment for autumn and winter goods is slightly better, there are few buyers with the financial strength to pre-order. As for future orders, imports have long been cut off, and domestic manufacturers with strong capital are not willing to confirm orders. Small factories have made some orders, but many want to collect 70% to 100% of the payment upfront, which makes potential customers feel unenthusiastic, creating a situation where both the spot market and future orders are quiet.</p>
<h3>Many Sell-Off Rumors, Chinese Stocks Listless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were somewhat fearful due to the inauguration of the President of the National Bank and the appearance of the heads of the Executive Yuan.

Each side scored one goal in the first half, and the match was tied. About 2,000 spectators watched the match at Yiyuan.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Exciting</p>
<p>The British Navy football team has never made a deep impression due to the lack of strong teams. However, the team that took the field yesterday played well and launched fierce attacks. Qingbai was embarrassed for a long time. If it weren't for the two penalty kicks, Qingbai would have been defeated. Yesterday, the fans had an unexpected harvest. The game was clean, fast, and quite exciting. Unfortunately, the grass at Yiyuan was long, and the ground was wet after the rain, leading to frequent loss of control, which was a minor flaw. Both sides had several thrilling moments and wonderful shots that hit or grazed the posts. It was a pity they missed by a fraction. The British Navy players were tall and ran fast. The center backs and inside forwards were especially good. Qingbai's forwards seemed to be a step slower. Wu Qixiang's absence was also a reason for Qingbai's nervousness. Qingbai, except for Meng Yiliang and Fei Chunhua, was made up of young players, which inevitably paled in comparison. He Chunhui was the referee, and Chen Jixiang and Shen Huichun were the linesmen.</p>
<p>One Goal Each</p>
<p>The British took the offensive first, but without success. Xiao Fei got the ball and crossed it. Yin Qingbing hit the goalkeeper's hand. Xiao Fei came again, and Gu Qingbing headed it. Wei Geshi caught it and kicked it out. Twelve minutes later, Xiao Fei cut in along the side again. Xiao Luo lightly flicked it, and the goalkeeper扑out it out. Qingbai attacked repeatedly without success. The British army was aggressive and gained an advantage. At 17 minutes, Griffin and Hachey pounced fiercely, but Huang Shijie saved them all. At 22 minutes, Liu Tiyi knocked on the door, but it was too high. Afterwards, Jin Lingsheng and Xu Yiti were injured while fighting for the ball, but fortunately they recovered soon. At 28 minutes, Xiao Luo got the ball and passed it to Lingsheng. Jin cut in and crossed. Yin Qingbing was behind, rushing forward like a flying, breaking through the defense. Qingbai took the lead. Subsequently, Jin Lingsheng got the ball twice and attacked, but both failed. At 33 minutes, the British army's forward crossed it. Meng Yiliang kicked it out not far. Evans窜rushed up and swept it in. Each side scored one goal in the first half, and the match was a draw.</p>
<p>Turning Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>After the break, Qin Bigaoliu Tiyi went off the field, and Zhang Fenggang Gu Yice entered as substitutes. The stalemate lasted until eight minutes, when Hachey carried the ball deep. Shijie撲empty, and Griffin rolled into the net with the ball, taking a 2-1 lead. The British army was very rampant, and Qingbai counterattacked again and again, but to no avail. From bad luck comes good luck. At 25 minutes, Mao Shiman tripped Xiao Fei in the penalty area. Xiao Luo took the penalty kick and tied the score 2-2. After that, the British army launched another attack. In the last few minutes before the end of the match, Jin Lingsheng went deep along the side and had the opportunity to cross. Meng Yiliang took the opportunity to pull the door. Mao Shiman touched阿斗the ball with his hand. Xiao Fei took the penalty kick and swept it in, leading Qingbai to turn defeat into victory 3-2.</p>

<h3>On Kierkegaard</h3>
<p>— Jingguan (Observing Quietly)</p>
<p>The 19th century in Europe produced two eccentrics in the world of thought. These two eccentrics both voiced serious protests against the Western civilization of the time. They were both dissatisfied with the prevailing ideas of the 19th century. They both argued that the world of thought should undergo some changes. Therefore, their ideas were incompatible with their times and were regarded as traitors to the world of thought. However, traitors to the world of thought are often heroes of the world of thought. Ideas that are rejected or ignored by one era are not necessarily worthless. The value of these ideas may be discovered and revered by another era. Thinkers often stand ahead of their times. If the distance between a thinker and his time is too great, he may not be recognized by his time. Sima Qian's saying, "Store it in famous mountains, waiting for the right person," is based on this understanding.</p>
<p>These two eccentrics were Friedrich Nietzsche of Germany and Søren Kierkegaard of Denmark. The former is well known to the Chinese and does not need further introduction from the author. The latter is rarely heard of by the Chinese, and even in the English-speaking world, people have only known about Kierkegaard for about a decade. Before a dozen years ago, there were no English translations available of Kierkegaard's works. The earliest English translation was a selected translation published by the University of Texas in 1932. It was not until after the outbreak of World War II that Kierkegaard's works gradually began to be translated by English-speaking scholars. Now, almost all of Kierkegaard's works have been translated into English. From the perspective of the English-speaking world, Kierkegaard is a thinker who was discovered during this war. However, Kierkegaard was discovered earlier in Germany. Two famous contemporary German philosophers, such as Jaspers and Heidegger, were both influenced by Kierkegaard's ideas in establishing their philosophies. The so-called "Philosophy of Existence" originates from Kierkegaard. Even the "Existentialism" currently popular in France, advocated by the writer Jean-Paul Sartre, also regards Kierkegaard as its founder. Kierkegaard has become an important figure in modern thought, and we cannot ignore him.</p>
<p>So, who exactly was Søren Kierkegaard? He was a Danish poet, religious thinker, and philosopher. He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1813 and died in 1855, at the age of only forty-two. He was once passionately in love with a woman, but for no apparent reason, he abandoned her. After that, he remained unmarried for the rest of his life. In university, his life was quite romantic, but soon he became a devout Christian. He considered himself a true Christian, but he was extremely dissatisfied with the Christianity of his time. In his later years, he wrote articles attacking the Danish state church. Therefore, he was almost a traitor within the church. But now it is different. Now he is regarded as a "religious poet," "the greatest Protestant of the nineteenth century," "one of the most profound 'interpreters' of the psychology of religious life since St. Augustine," and even "one of the greatest and most unique thinkers of all time."</p>
<p>What were the ideas of this thinker? Naturally, this cannot be explained in a few words. What can be said here is that he was an opponent of abstract thought and pure intellectualism. He believed that man is not a pure thinker, but an "Existing Individual." Truth is also not purely objective, but subjective. Truth is subjective truth, which individuals must discover and grasp with their absolute sincerity and total passion. This is not a cold observation or a ruthless contemplation. It is a manifestation of the individual's entire spirit and strength. This is an internal struggle, a most important "Choice." Everyone has to discover their own truth, "to discover the truth that is true for me—the idea by which I can live and die." The choice of this truth is my own choice. What determines my choice is the "existential thinking" of my "existing individual," not abstract thinking. The choice I make regarding the relationship between life and death cannot be shaken by any abstract thinking. For those who have chosen Jesus Christ as their truth, Kierkegaard says, "The only possible objection is that he might be saved by another method. He cannot answer that. It is like someone saying to another who is in love, yes, but you might fall in love with another woman. To this, the person in love must say, I cannot answer that, for I only know that she is my beloved. When this lover can answer this question, he is no longer a lover; so when a believer can answer the above question, he is no longer a believer." Faith is not a matter of intellect, nor is truth merely a matter of intellect. Those who try to solve everything with intellect or who use intellect as the basis of religion are opposed by Kierkegaard.</p>
<p>When people are disappointed with intellect, Kierkegaard's ideas are bound to be welcomed. War is the failure of intellect. The fact that Kierkegaard's ideas became popular during and after the war is very relevant. The author does not dare to accept Kierkegaard's ideas. They are too dangerous. Personal sincerity and passion can grasp truth, but they can also grasp error. Choices not based on intellect are often wrong choices. However, there is no doubt that he and his ideas are worthy of attention and study.</p>
<h3>The Psychological Personality</h3>
<p>— Sun Qi</p>
<p>The body is the dwelling of the mind, and the mind is the master of the body. The two have an inseparable relationship. The mind, separated from the body, loses its foundation and cannot exist. The body, separated from the mind, is reduced to an unconscious substance, without any function. The whole of a person is composed of body and mind. The body is the expression of the mind, and the mind is the expression of the body. As our Confucian predecessors said: "When the heart is solemn, the body is relaxed; when the heart is respectful, the countenance is reverent." This is the idea. Therefore, human life and activities include both physical and mental aspects. Physical health is certainly important, but mental health is even more important. Without a healthy body, one is certainly not capable of undertaking great responsibilities; without a healthy mind, how can one be a symbol of personality and improve society? Sun Yat-sen said: "The state is the accumulation of people, and the person is the vessel of the mind. State affairs are a phenomenon of mass psychology. Therefore, the rise and fall of politics depend closely on the vitality or listlessness of the human heart." This means that whether or not a person's mind is healthy is of the utmost importance to the individual and the nation.</p>
<p>Human life and activities are due to the existence of the organism. With the existing organism, one becomes aware of the "I." After a baby is born, it knows to suck milk to maintain its life. As it grows, everything it encounters is for the sake of "I." All activities are based on the "I." The "I" is recognized by everyone and valued by everyone. Therefore, modern self-psychologists (Self Psychology), such as James Ward, McDougall, and Miss Mary W. Calkins, believe that of all things in the universe, only the self is most real, and everything else is unreliable. This means that the primary purpose of life is the self (Self). The self is the unified subject of physical and mental activity, and in psychology, it is a functional term. Therefore, if we want to maintain mental health, we must first have a correct understanding of the self. The reason why the self can exist must be expressed through personality. The so-called self-love is to maintain personality, which shows that the relationship between personality and self is very close. As Li Shicen said: "The psychological personality is centered on the self."</p>
<p>The self is due to one's own recognition, and one's ability to recognize must be based on self-awareness. Calkins said: "The positive basis of the self is based on introspection," which is also the idea. Self-awareness, in short, is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is not easy. As the saying goes: "It is difficult to know others, but it is even more difficult to know oneself." The method of study of the great Greek philosopher Socrates was "Know thyself." To know oneself, the first thing is to be able to introspect, to have the spirit of Zengzi's "I examine myself three times a day," to use the psychological method of introspection to examine one's own shortcomings and advantages, and after knowing one's own shortcomings, to find ways to improve or avoid them, so as to reduce errors or failures, and after knowing one's own advantages, to give full play to one's strengths and benefit society. If a person cannot know himself, or is arrogant, or abandons himself, he will not only harm himself, but also harm society. Therefore, self-awareness occupies a very important position in the realization of the self. For, in addition to the physical form, there is also a kind of spiritual function that can represent the existence of the "I." Although this concept may not be clear to everyone in general, in practice, no matter who it is, they can be angry or ashamed because of slander, or happy or apprehensive because of rewards. All actions of one's self are known to come from one's own spirit. Even illiterate people, as long as their minds are healthy, can do this. This is a clear fact. As for people with a higher level of self-awareness, their introspection is better than others, and they can better recognize their own spiritual function. This can be said to be "my self-awareness."</p>
<p>The most important thing about the spiritual function for the self is the unity of my self. Although my mood and thoughts may sometimes be different, the mind that recognizes things and the consciousness that distinguishes right from wrong are always the same. Yesterday, I could recognize the things of the world and form ideas. Today, this ability has not disappeared, but still exists. Even in comparison, there is some progress, and this progress is a continuation of the past, based on the past, and not something that other elements have been added to. Therefore, this understanding has a fundamentally unchanging permanence. This unchanging permanence is the expression of self-unity. Unity is a key to defending personality. The reason why we can take one path forward without going astray is entirely due to this unifying force. If we lose this unifying force, then the personality will inevitably be split, such as the same consciousness, operating in two ways at the same time, and the two ways have no connection. This is called simultaneous dual personality. As for the same personality gradually changing into a different personality, personality A suddenly becomes personality B, this is called continuous dual personality. This phenomenon of lack of apperception is actually a psychological pathology. Therefore, personality takes the self as its content, and the completion of personality is the unification of the self.</p>
<p>The unification of the self is the spiritual action of consciousness. The development of the unification of consciousness is very great. It can not only unify all the physiological activities of the five senses and hundreds of skeletons, but also unify the psychological activities of knowing, feeling, and willing. Among the so-called knowing, feeling, and willing in psychological activities, the will is completely in charge. Will is the source of the establishment of personality. Will is important in having a purpose and forging ahead. That "knowing" that is important in careful observation, and "feeling" that is important in excellent cultivation, are only side effects that help the will to become enriched. The stimulation of the will is the ideal (Ideal). The ideal is the secret to making people progress, and it is also a good way to prevent people from falling. As the saying goes: "Who is not as good as me in loving goodness?" The heart of making progress is a natural phenomenon. This phenomenon is manifested psychologically, but it is the realization of the self. Therefore, the activity of the self is the activity of the will. The will has the highest authority, and it powerfully controls and overcomes all instinctive emotional impulses that do not coincide with its purpose, so that the individual of the mind is kneaded into a healthy self, which can satisfy the self's proper ideals, and obtain the happiness of self-realization.</p>
<p>The reason why man is man is that man has personality. The reason why personality is sound is that the self is healthy. With a healthy self, one can take personality as the goal, restrain the indulgence of the "small self," and try to develop the "big self." Mencius said: "Those who follow their greater part are great men, and those who follow their smaller part are small men." The "greater part" is the "big self," which refers specifically to the spiritual side. The "smaller part" is the "small self," which refers specifically to the ears, eyes, mouth, and stomach. If a person can realize the preciousness of the greater part, and expand and enrich it from a little of the mind—spiritual function, he can get the "true self." The so-called "true self" is the spiritual self, not the "illusory self" of the physical self. The entire body can be old and die, but the function of the spirit can be as usual. The common term "spiritual immortality" really refers specifically to the value of the spirit, and it is not like the "soul after death" in the sense of the religionists.</p>
<p>One's own recognition of the self and striving for the realization of personality is certainly an important task for establishing oneself and advancing in virtue, but at the same time, one must also have the mentality of self-existence, other-existence, and other-existence, self-existence, and "benefit the world," "if one wants to establish oneself, one must also establish others; if one wants to achieve oneself, one must also help others achieve." Only in this way can one show the greatness of one's own personality. Therefore, the lack of order in today's society and the decline of people's minds are certainly related to people's unhealthy psychology and lack of self-awareness, but the main reason is still due to the decadent habit of most people "only sweeping the snow in front of their own doors, and not caring about the frost on others' roofs." Especially the knowledge class in general who bear social responsibility, mostly hold a "look out for one's self" attitude, thinking that things are not done by me, or things are not related to me, so they do not care. One should know that the relationship between the individual and society is very close. The activities of the individual can affect the whole society, and the individual is also affected by the whole society at the same time. Therefore, for the sake of the individual and for the sake of society, one must not only do good and not do evil oneself, but also persuade others to do good and not do evil. Doing good and not doing evil oneself is passive, and persuading others to do good and not do evil is active. Otherwise, others doing evil and not doing good will directly harm society, and indirectly will also harm each individual. A gentleman loves others with virtue, not with indulgence. Throwing a stone can scald the whole sea, and planting good causes will surely have good results. We must not only strive for the nobility of individual personality, but also use the consciousness of the same kind to promote the nobility of other people's personality, and use the mutual influence of each individual's personality to improve people's psychology and to improve society, so that we can be effective.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the whole of mankind, the level of personality is extremely inconsistent, and the grades of personality are also uneven. The reason why personality can be noble and why it can be great is that it relies on the strength of the human mind. The mind is the "source of all things." We must first be able to maintain mental health, so that people can make appropriate adaptations to external or internal stimuli, and can adapt to changes in order to establish the dignity of personality, and then complete its complete personality.</p>
<h3>Aristotle's First Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Ziqiang</p>
<p>Although Aristotle generally included all branches of science within the scope of philosophy, his system implicitly distinguished between natural and social sciences, with philosophy placed above these sciences. He called philosophy the study of the highest principles, or first philosophy; other disciplines were second (his physics was called second philosophy), third, and so on. Aristotle, following Socrates and Plato, believed that knowledge was nothing more than a collection of concepts. Concepts are principles, so knowledge is merely a collection of principles. When principles are categorized, they form different fields of knowledge. Roughly speaking, Aristotle's system is divided into three categories: theoretical, practical, and creative. More specifically, it is further divided into physics, biology, psychology, and so on—all based on the categorization of principles. By combining these categories of principles and using inductive and deductive methods to find the principle that governs all principles, he called it the highest principle. The study of the highest principle he called the study of the highest principle or first philosophy; in reality, it is what is commonly called philosophy. From the perspective of his entire system, it should be called philosophy in the narrow sense.</p>
<p>Aristotle's view of philosophy as the study of the highest principles is essentially the same as Plato's view of philosophy as the apex of all knowledge. Therefore, Aristotle's theory, apart from the scientific aspects lacking in Plato's work, follows the same path in philosophy (in the narrow sense, that is, metaphysics) as Plato's: Plato built philosophy on ordinary knowledge and rational knowledge, while Aristotle built philosophy on the various sciences. They both pioneered what is now called the metaphysics of science. Below, we will compare their similarities and differences in their understanding of philosophy (Plato called it the study of Forms or dialectic, Aristotle called it first philosophy or the study of the highest principles) in more detail:</p>
<p>Similarities: (1) Object—The object of philosophy is pure Being, the common foundation of all existence. (2) Task—Philosophy seeks the roots of things, aiming to reach the universal and ultimate basis and cause behind all things. (3) Position—The position of philosophy is above all learning, being the synthesis of all knowledge. (4) Function—The function of philosophy is to seek the highest good and happiness for life. Because of their above view of philosophy, philosophers were virtually seen as omniscient in their eyes, their knowledge being the quintessence of all learning.</p>
<p>Differences: (1) Content—Plato believed that philosophy included both knowledge and action; Aristotle, however, clearly distinguished between knowledge and action. For him, philosophy stems only from the theoretical instinct and has nothing to do with the practical instinct. (2) Material—Plato's materials were limited to pure concepts; his philosophy was merely a large collection of the separation and aggregation of Forms. Aristotle's materials, however, were empirical facts. His so-called highest principles can be reduced to empirical facts, and in fact are derived from experience.</p>
<p>By comparing Aristotle's so-called first philosophy with the rest of his system, we can gain a clearer understanding of it: (1) Distinction between the practical and creative parts—(A) The goal of practical and creative actions is not the action itself, but the result of the action. For example, the goal of ethical action is the discovery of behavioral norms, and the goal of artistic action is the creation of works of art. Philosophical action is different. Philosophical action is thought, and the goal of thought is thought itself, not another thing outside of thought. (B) Philosophy is a matter of pure thought and has nothing to do with emotion, feeling—the so-called non-intellectual part of human nature. The study of the practical and creative parts, however, is closely related to emotion and feeling. The inability of medicine to detach itself from sensation is self-evident, and ethics is also inextricably linked to issues such as desire. (2) Distinction between physics and mathematics—The object of physics is tangible, changeable things, because its object is entirely that which is in the form. That which is in form has no formless and immutable form. The object of mathematics is immutable, but it has form, such as geometric figures. Although they never change, they have shape. Only the object of philosophy is immutable and formless, because the highest principle in the universe cannot change and has no form.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Academic World (23)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Western Philosophers on Chinese Civilization (Continued)</p>
<p>Emerson believed that China's advantages lay not only in its emphasis on education. Chinese history has several major inventions, and China has also made contributions to astronomy. Its historical records are more ancient than those of other countries. It is undeniable that China in the past spent too little effort in exploring natural phenomena. However, for thousands of years, countless Chinese scholars have devoted their lives to academics, engaging in profound and far-reaching thinking. Once Chinese scholars shift their efforts to the natural world, Chinese scientific research will definitely make accelerated progress. The Chinese science of the last thirty years can serve as proof of this. In 1935, the late Dr. Ding Wenjiang, Director-General of the Academia Sinica, wrote a concise report entitled "The Study of Chinese Science," published in the British journal Nature on August 10 of that year. In recent years, Professor J.B.S. Haldane of the University of London said in his new book "The Social Function of Science": "Judging from its past achievements, it is not difficult to see that the background of Chinese culture, if it can be slightly reformed, can become a very good garden for scientific work. With the Chinese attitude of rigorous work, the habit of patience, and the virtue of moderation, it can be expected that China's contribution to science will definitely not be less than that of Europe and the United States." Some of the sprouts of China's new science have been transplanted from all directions. At present, many famous professors in Chinese universities have studied in the West, and those who have returned to China and made significant achievements in education and academia are indeed numerous.</p>
<p>After the end of World War I, both Dewey and Russell were invited to China to lecture at various universities. Based on his personal experience, Russell commented on Chinese culture, stating: "The strength of Western culture lies in the scientific method, and the strength of Chinese culture lies in a rational view of life. We hope that the two can gradually combine into one." In recent years, there has been a new trend of thought in China that is developing simultaneously with science, namely the New Confucianism movement. This is a positive and critical humanism. Chinese culture will be revived by the convergence of New Confucianism and science, and it is believed that this new culture will have appropriate countermeasures for the current global problems, or at least help in the solution of the problems.</p>
<p>A great contemporary philosopher once said: "The more we understand Chinese art, Chinese literature, and Chinese philosophy of life, the more we admire the superb realm of Chinese culture. In terms of the vastness of its history and the size of its population, Chinese culture is clearly the most magnificent school of world culture." This is the opinion of A.N. Whitehead, a retired professor at Harvard University. Of course, Chinese culture has many weaknesses, and we are not unaware of them. Chinese scholars have an open mind and are willing to accept new foreign concepts. With the increasing frequency of modern international contact, we deeply feel that the internationality of academic culture is becoming increasingly strong.</p>
<p>In his later years, Emerson declared that a new era was about to begin, meaning that Eastern and Western cultures would converge. Emerson was the first American scholar to focus on the study of Eastern thought and artifacts. His interest in Chinese culture did not diminish in his old age, so he was the most suitable person to be the proclaimer and interpreter of this new era. Great thinkers in history often transcend their times, and Emerson's vision and insight can be said to be lasting and ever new.</p>

<h3>Reader's Opinion: The Simple Facilities of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway: Passengers Jointly Request Improvement</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: We are passengers on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Due to the company's various corrupt practices, we find it difficult to remain silent. We are using a corner of your newspaper to appeal to the public to urge them to improve.</p>
<p>(1) Simple Facilities: Regarding facilities, including stations, vehicles, roads, bridges, etc., everything is currently done perfunctorily. The stations are not decent. Passengers have nowhere to sit while waiting for the bus (the Shanghai station is slightly better, but there are too few benches). Vehicles often "break down." The roads and bridges are in a terrible state. A lot of road maintenance fees are collected, but they are unwilling to repair the roads properly. In damaged areas of the bridge surface, two additional fir trees are added, which is dangerous. They save money, but the safety of passengers is a major problem.</p>
<p>(2) Poor Service: Most of the staff at each station are slow and unreasonable, especially at a certain small station along the line. Passengers not only get off the bus first, but also squeeze up. As a result, those getting off cannot get off. The staff ignore this. The Shanghai station is also terribly dirty, and no one is seen cleaning the bus. Buying tickets and departing do not follow the prescribed time. Sometimes tickets are sold only ten minutes before departure. Sometimes passengers buy tickets and go in, but cannot find the bus, and have to wait for an hour, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. The order at the Shanghai and Dachang stations is very chaotic.</p>
<p>(3) Rapid Price Increase: The company's bus ticket prices are expensive. The speed and multiple of the price increase are also quite alarming. The price increase of Shanghai's public utilities is only about 20%, and they are still criticized and pointed out by all sectors of society. They, however, increase by 50% at once. At the same time, we know that they are making money every month and are not losing money, so the repeated price increases are unreasonably exploitative.</p>
<p>Finally, we ask the Shanghai-Taicang Company to recognize the nature of their own business and seek improvement to benefit the public. Readers Shen Xiaojian, Zhengqing, Wang Deming, Jiang Yongan, etc., respectfully submit this.</p>

<h3>Visiting Mei Lanfang Again (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Cao Zikai</p>
<p>Last year, during the plum blossom season, I went to visit Dr. Mei shortly after returning to Shanghai from Chongqing. Photos and articles were published in Shen Bao. After Qingming this year, I took my eldest daughter Chen Bao and fourth daughter Yiyin, two daughters who love Peking opera, to Shanghai to watch Dr. Mei perform. Fearing to add to his social obligations during the performance period, I originally did not intend to visit him. However, after watching a performance of The Goddess of the Luo River, I ended up visiting him the next day because Chen Bao and Yiyin were eager to see the true face of the "King of Actors." After seeing his true face, we planned to watch The Selling Horse that evening.</p>
<p>This time, I did not tell anyone else and did not invite a photographer to come along. Instead, I asked his erhu teacher, Mr. Ni Qiuping, to notify him and then quietly visited him with my two daughters at 4 PM. Just as we were about to get into the car, I happened to meet my second daughter's husband, Song Mufa, on Sima Road. He was sitting on a rattan chair by the roadside, having his shoes shined. When he heard that we were going to visit Mr. Mei, he stopped shining one of his shoes and jumped into our car to go with us. Chen Bao and Yiyin said it was "good luck from heaven!" Because he also loved Peking opera, although not as much as Chen Bao and Yiyin. In the eyes of Peking opera fans, getting to know the true face of the "King of Actors" was more glorious than "beholding his great face" and brought more "Dharma joy" than "meeting the Tathagata." So when we got out of the car in front of the Mei residence and knocked on the door, and two small foreign dogs ran out, Mufa teased them, saying, "Wouldn't you be happy to become one of them?"</p>
<p>Sitting in the guest room where I had sat last spring, I looked at the furnishings in the room, which were not much different from last spring. Thinking back on my own mood, it was also not much different from last spring. "Eternal youth" is the perfect phrase to bless the host we were visiting. The host had not yet come downstairs, so the Qin player Ni Qiuping came to accompany us first. This Qin player is also quite extraordinary: he plays the erhu for Peking opera on stage, but he is very fond of Western music off stage, cherishing sonatas and symphonies more than precious jade. Because his daughter has this family learning, she is a talented student at the National Conservatory of Music. He said that his love for Western music was due to reading my old book "Musical Knowledge" (Asia East Library edition). Therefore, he often corresponded with me, and this was the first time we had met. I live in the Zhenhua Hotel, diagonally opposite the Tianchan Theater. Every night after playing the erhu, he would bring his Qin bag to the hotel to chat with me until late at night. Half of the conversations were about Peking opera, and half about Western music. I study Western music but love Peking opera, and he plays Peking opera but loves Western music. They are opposite in appearance but complementary in reality, so the conversation never ends. This afternoon, he came to the Mei residence to wait for us. This was the first time I saw Ni Qiuping during the day. After chatting with him for a few words, the host came downstairs.</p>
<p>During the handshake, I saw that Dr. Mei looked even younger than last spring. His face was fuller, his hair was darker, and his attitude was more amiable. I also caught a glimpse of Chen Bao, Yiyin, and Mufa, staring at him without blinking, without saying a word, without moving, like the three bodhisattvas lost in the City God Temple. I found it funny. Unexpectedly, their gazes turned from the host to me, and they all laughed. I understood the meaning of their laughter: I am four years younger than this host, but my face is haggard and my hair is white, and I look old. This older brother, who is four years older than me, is still young and could pass for my younger brother. Moreover, he can perform beautiful poses on stage in the evening! God's creation of man is really lacking in common sense! How can it not make people laugh?</p>
<p>I raised the issue of the stage performance of The Goddess of the Luo River, hoping to film a sound and color movie so that it can be disseminated permanently and universally. Mr. Mei said there were extreme difficulties and it could not be realized for the time being. I had also urged him to make a movie last spring. I think this matter is his most important and urgent task. We who do calligraphy and painting can make and print our original manuscripts so that they can be permanently and universally circulated. Although opera singers have records, they can only preserve their singing skills; to preserve their performance skills, it is necessary to make a movie. Science has advanced to this atomic age and can use a device the size of a button to kill millions of people in an instant, but it is unwilling to make a few films for our "genius of the century." This is again lacking in common sense, how can it not make people sigh!</p>
<p>The topic turned to symbolic representation. Mr. Mei talked about the performance of throwing water he saw in Moscow: a large piece of white cloth, with people holding the four corners, moving, like water waves; holes are opened in the cloth, people jump into the holes, and then come out, like throwing water. He said that our Fishermen's Revenge is different. It doesn't need cloth, but uses the up and down of the body to represent the undulation of the waves. When he said this, he was sitting on the sofa wearing a suit and slightly making the posture of Gui Ying'er, and everyone laughed particularly. This reminded me of the laughter caused among the audience when I accidentally drew a human head on the blackboard during a lecture. I very much approve of the symbolic expression of Peking opera because it is similar to my caricaturist's method of omission. When I draw portraits, I usually only draw one mouth on the face, and do not draw eyebrows and eyes. Or even the mouth is not drawn, and the appearance is left entirely to the imagination of the viewer. (Therefore, last year a certain tabloid ridiculed me, with a large headline "Feng Zikai is shameless," and the content of the article first complimented me, and finally said that his paintings are uniquely original, with a few strokes, the spirit is lifelike, and the head of the person is drawn without the eyelids, etc. People who only look at the headline and do not have time to read the article must think that I have done something shameless. This tabloid is really mischievous!) This is similar to the expression of Peking opera: opening a door, riding a horse, and rowing a boat, there are no real doors, horses, and boats, all left to the imagination of the audience. The imagined doors, horses, and boats are more beautiful than the real ones. If there is a real background, it is not pleasing. It's like sometimes I accidentally draw out the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and nose one by one. The appearance is determined, and I often feel that it is nothing more than that, with a complete view, which is clumsier than not drawing and allowing people to imagine freely.</p>
<h3>Memory Club</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where culture and talent gather. Poets and men of letters come from all directions to live as temporary residents. Although there is noise from carriages and horses and the clamor of merchants, the spirit of poetry and wine still exists, such as the Southern Society, Ming Society, and Xi Society of the past, and the Huai Chao Society of today. The Huai Chao Society is presided over by Qu Tuiyuan of Shanhua to commemorate his late father, Wen Shen Gong Hongji. Hongji, courtesy name Ziju, sobriquet Zhi'an, was a Jinshi of the Qing Tongzhi era. He served as Minister of Works and Co-Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat. He was skilled in poetry and often composed poems with Boyan, Fanshan, Jie'an, Yifeng, and Yi'an. His collected works, The Selected Poems of Wen Shen Gong, were praised by Chen Shiyi as being well-organized and appropriate. In his later years, he lived in Shanghai, naming his residence Chao Lan Lou, where he read, wrote poetry, and sang, almost forgetting the years. Tuiyuan invited the former officials and students of his late father to establish a poetry society, naming it Huai Chao Society. At the time, famous scholars such as Sun Cangsou, Yang Wansou, Gao Chuiwan, and Wu Meisun, totaling more than ten people, composed poems with excellent verses, comparable to the elegant gathering in the West Garden, illuminating the past and the future. Cangsou and Wansou were the oldest in the society, both over eighty years old. Cangdian's name was Jing, sobriquet Beishan Weng, and he was skilled in writing inscriptions on oracle bones. In his early years, he studied at Nanjiang and studied the Gongyang School. He once served as magistrate of Qingshen County and had a reputation for good governance. The year before last, he revisited Chongqing and composed a poem recounting his father's teachings, and people praised him for his unremitting filial piety. Wansou, a native of Taixing, was named Tiren and was a childhood friend of the late Mr. Cheng Yaosheng. His poems were desolate and passionate, similar to Du Ling's in his time. He was also skilled in calligraphy, elegant and ancient, with the demeanor of cranes hesitating to stop. He intends to expand his connections with scholars in Shanghai. Chuiwan and Meisun were born on the same day of the same month of the same year. Chuiwan's sobriquet is Hanpa, and Meisun's sobriquet is Hanyu, hence the line "Lonely in the Jiangguan, the head is not yet white, the cold light shines brightly." Last year, on the birthday of Dongpo, they held a meeting of poets in his temple. I joined the ranks, offering wine to wish him good fortune. Both were seventy years old, so celebrating Su's longevity was also celebrating their own longevity. Tuiyuan was also present that day. The pleasant conversation continued until sunset.</p>
<h3>Drifting on a Raft at Sea</h3>
<p>— Tongtuo</p>
<p>In 1896, two Norwegians in Brooklyn earned a living by dredging oysters off the coast of New Jersey. One was named Sommersen, and the other Haubold. Both were naturally strong and had a wealth of maritime experience. One day, Sommersen said to Haubold: "If someone dares to venture across the ocean in a small boat, they can quickly become wealthy. People would be willing to pay to see this little boat." They both agreed that this was something that could not be done alone, but with their combined efforts, they could complete the voyage in two months, planning to row 54 miles a day. Therefore, they were willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>They spent two years working on this plan in their spare time, building a boat 18 feet long. Fox, the publisher of the "Alarm" newspaper, helped them build the wooden boat, so they named the canoe "Fox." The boatmen shook their heads and sighed when they saw their boat, but Sommersen and Haubold continued to work hard, assembling everything. The boat was equipped with five oars, a compass, a sextant, a cushion, signal lights, and five gallons of kerosene for use on a small stove at the front of the boat. The food included 250 eggs, 100 pounds of biscuits, 9 pounds of coffee, and many cans of meat. The clothing included the clothes they were wearing and a set of oilskins. There was no tobacco, alcohol, or sails on the boat.</p>
<p>The "Fox" sailed out to sea, and the two Norwegians began to carefully calculate the journey: each person had to row at least fifteen and a half hours a day. At first, the weather was excellent, but tending to the oil stove was troublesome. It was difficult to get the oil stove to light even in a light breeze. They had very little coffee, and the eggs were soon gone.</p>
<p>On the fourth night, Haubold fell asleep on the side of the boat. Suddenly, he woke up and shouted: "Something is hitting our boat!"</p>
<p>They turned, and there was another bump on the bottom of the boat, and then a white fish flashed out of the dim water. "A shark!" said Haubold. The shark followed the boat for two days, but the two paid no attention to it,一心一意划向他们的目的地巴黎去。(一心一意划向他们的目的地巴黎去。) (concentrated on rowing to their destination, Paris)</p>
<p>A week after they set off, the weather at sea suddenly changed, and a violent easterly wind blew head-on. The waves rose higher and higher, crashing over the Fox. At 9 AM, the two gave up rowing and dropped anchor. At 5 PM, Haubold calculated the journey, but they had gone backwards 25 miles.</p>
<p>The two tried their best to row, sometimes singing songs, but most of the time they were just trying to row. On July 1, they encountered a fishing boat in "distress." The captain greeted them and was surprised to invite them on board for a short rest. It was the first cooked lunch Haubold and Sommersen had eaten in three weeks.</p>
<p>On July 7, a squall suddenly came from the western sea. They had been battling the raging waves for two days, bailing water out ten times a day. On the second night, a huge wave hit the "Fox" and capsized it. The two fell into the cold water. But in this dangerous situation, they had made arrangements early on. Each person put on a lifebuoy and connected themselves to the boat with bandages. The boat was also equipped with handholds to allow seafarers to hold on. After several attempts, they turned the boat over, climbed into the boat, and bailed the water out with all their might. Most of the food they had brought was lost, and their clothes were completely soaked.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the wind and waves calmed down immediately, but the backs of their hands were extremely painful as a result of the rain, wind, and sun. The most difficult thing was the lack of food. Fortunately, on July 15, they encountered a fellow countryman's boat, the "Westoe," and were re-equipped with fresh water and food. So they continued their voyage.</p>
<p>On August 1, they saw the Isles of Scilly, a small island southwest of England. On August 7, they arrived at the port of Le Havre, France. The shore erupted in cheers.</p>
<h3>On Turning Waste Wood into Meat</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>A German scientist named Bergus (currently serving in a U.S. infantry division) has invented a miracle: "Turning waste wood into meat." After the Allied forces turned to bombing and destroying German industry, two factories can produce 800 tons of wood-based food per month, enough to supply 1.7 million German citizens with wartime meat rations. If there were 100 such factories, their production would be sufficient to overcome the famine in the years after the war.</p>
<p>This news gives me the following thoughts—</p>
<p>It is an excellent refutation to the many who shout about spiritual civilization saving humanity from catastrophe while denying science; the greatness of the so-called "spiritual civilization" against science is said to be able to eliminate "killing," while the development of natural science is considered likely to assist in killing. But the fact proves that the more developed science is, the more advanced mankind is, and the need for killing is decreasing more and more, not only for humans, but also extended to living things. For example, the cause of war, the argument of "population theory" arises from insufficient food distribution. If waste wood can be turned into meat as shown in the above news, what worries do humans still have about insufficient food and causing war? If this invention is developed to the extreme, it will make the world's food inexhaustible and naturally there will be no so-called "failed countries" that take war as a way out. Furthermore, the reason why the so-called spiritual civilization is touching and pleasing is in "peace," whether Taoism or Buddhism, the motivation of vegetarianism and abstinence from killing is originally impeccable. But the result is that it can only rely on people's suppression of their instincts' "asceticism," not only is it limited to a few high monks and Taoists who can fulfill this ascetic precept, but also they must sacrifice health and nutrition in exchange for the practice of altruism towards creatures. That is to say: not killing life is due to subjective, forced good thoughts, rather than objective natural conditions that make them not need to kill life. The invention of turning waste wood into meat will allow mankind to enter the realm of not killing life without sacrificing health, is it not truly a great civilization? "Spiritual civilization," if there is really such a thing in the world, must also depend on the progress of science to produce and have something to rely on, otherwise it is just the fantasy of metaphysicians.</p>
<p>To thoroughly eliminate the crisis of war, social science and natural science must progress equally and complement each other.</p>
<h3>How to Distinguish the Sex of Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Friends who raise goldfish often like to match them in pairs. It is easy enough to match colors and shapes that are exactly the same, but it is very difficult to match exactly one male and one female.</p>
<p>Goldfish that grow to several years old are priced surprisingly high in fish gardens. If you calculate carefully, they are not too expensive, because it takes three to five years to grow the fish to select colors, shapes, and general sizes from thousands of fish. Often, a very good pair of fish are either all females or all males, unless the sexes are also matched when selecting species in their youth, they can grow old together in pairs, so as not to become lonely.</p>
<p>The sex of goldfish can be clearly seen when they are an inch long. If you are not sure, you can also touch them with your hands. Hold the fish in your hand and press your finger against its abdomen. The male fish's scales are tightly wrapped, firm and without gaps, while the female fish's abdomen is surprisingly soft, because it contains eggs (when the fish lay eggs, only a part of them are released), you can tell the difference with one touch.</p>
<p>As for large fish of three or four years old, during the spawning period, the male fish's tail fins are torn and have white thorns, and can even emit light, making it even more obvious that it is a male fish.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The mess in the world situation, the fact that human beings are increasingly moving towards destruction through mutual slaughter, although only a few heroic men are responsible, and not all men are to blame, women are completely blameless. For example, the warmongering and martial spirit of Germany, the former such as William II, such as Bismarck, the latter such as Hitler, which one is not glaring and fierce. Also, such as Mussolini of Italy, his face full of muscle, looks like a living devil, and even he has always claimed to be a hero and great man. Also, such as Japan, which has always valued men and belittled women, although Japanese women limit themselves to being virtuous mothers and good wives, they do have a kind and diligent demeanor. Imagine if Japan had turned from valuing men and belittling women to valuing women and belittling men earlier, and made all politics, military affairs, and diplomacy the responsibility of some Willow, Thousand Moon, Uemura Shoko, and Shimoda Umeko, it would not have been as unrestrained as Doihara, Tanaka Giichi, Honjo, Araki, and Tojo. Therefore, I extend the words of a certain mayor and a certain president and create a slogan: "Women of all races in the world, unite!" "Build a special women's international!" "All men in the world, retire from military service! All rule and all military and political affairs will be taken over by women." "Thoroughly settle accounts for the many sins of men." After the establishment of the "Special Women's International," all previous special internationals and ordinary internationals will be abolished!</p>
<p>Europeans use "Man" in Mankind to exclusively refer to "men," saying that Mankind is the entire human race, but when referring specifically to women, there are so-called Woman and Womankind. Woman is an abbreviation of Wifeman. This coincides with the Chinese "woman" and already contains the meaning of inequality. But Europeans also use GentleSex as a special term for women, then it goes without saying that men are Rough Sex. From this point of view, the barbaric behavior of men should be condemned and abandoned, what more can be said.</p>
<h3>Two Recent Poems</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>The State of the World</p>
<p>The sea has not yet calmed, the river is not yet clear, the world is still a puppet that is not public: those who love scabs are full of rich men's houses, those who lick hemorrhoids return to the red society to welcome them. Who are the dogs and worms who cunningly operate? Shrimps run wild and crabs cause chaos and run rampant! The struggle for fame and wealth arises, from ancient times to the present there have been armor and soldiers.</p>
<p>Feelings While Traveling</p>
<p>Spring is old, the traveler is stranded far from home, the war dust urges a white hair, heaven and earth are impartial and cause much killing, every time I want to retreat to the gardens, I hesitate; the years pass quickly, a thousand volumes of poetry, a myriad cups of wine amidst the scattered mountains and rivers, how can I be as quiet as entering samadhi, this heart suddenly like ash in meditation?</p>
