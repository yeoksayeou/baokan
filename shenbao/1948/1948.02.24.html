<h3>瀋西醞釀主力大戰　新民東北匪軍嘯聚甚多　關內有力國軍出關增防</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿三日電〕瀋陽以西之新民，正醞釀主力大戰，現新民東北之巨流河東南北三面均有戰事，匪自廿一日來，向該地區嘯聚，新民南部柳河溝地區國軍兵力至雄厚。匪似妄圖開闢三戰塲，主戰塲在新民，北戰塲或在開原鐵嶺間，開原附近由通江口竄到匪頗多。竄開原附近之匪，係第十縱隊及韓共李紅光支隊等。南戰塲似爲營口，匪由鞍山竄至牛莊地區，國軍已準備迎擊。瀋陽西北地區匪在卅公里之萬金台·老邊一帶竄擾，數目無多，係牽制作用。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿三日電〕竄新民地區之匪聞爲一·七·八等縱隊，似擬以主力先奪巨流河大鐵橋破壞之，再略新民。現巨流河橋附近地區已有接觸。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕（一）遼西共匪佔大虎山後，積極搶修自通遼至錦瀋段之鐵路，刻正續自新立屯向大虎山修築，惟此段因受飛機轟炸，迄尙未修通。（二）關內某部國軍即向關外錦楡段增防，關外范兵團即可主動東進。</p>

<h3>塔虎特·馬丁·周以德　大聲疾呼軍事援華　將來和平遠東較歐洲重要</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕有力共和黨議貝，廿三日力主對華應有更多軍事上之援助。俄亥俄洲共和黨參議員塔虎特與衆議院談長馬丁，嚴厲抨擊政府當局不能在其五億七千萬元援華計劃中包括强有力之反共軍事援助。塔虎特在其準備於底德律發表之演詞中稱：「復興中國之現實性以及此種救濟之價値，爲一公開問題，然我人必須予中國政府以足以抵抗在東北共軍力量之武器與軍火，猶如我人在希臘之抵禦共黨勢力然。塔虎特指出此種局勢之「癥結所在」，實爲馬歇爾之「不喜歡中國人，並對中國問題不感興趣」。又稱：「除非立即採取積極行動，整個東北即將陷於共產主義，如東北受共產主義之控制，則我人和很能期望將來日本可不受其滲入」？</p>
<p>馬丁同意塔虎特之意見，認爲政府要求一反共援歐計劃，然同時反對有效之援華，實爲矛盾。渠稱：不問馬歇爾上週之力言中國不能有效利用已經付予之帮助，渠仍堅持對華必須作軍事上之援助。渠預料議會至少可批准一部份政府所要求之五億七千萬援華計劃，然渠更預料各議員將要求以武器與軍需援助蔣主席政府。</p>
<p>塔虎特稱：對華政策「將廢弛遠東一切馬歇爾計劃企岡在歐洲建立者」。渠稱：「最後迫使政府當局放棄綏靖蘇聯政策，大多爲范登堡之力。渠深信，追從是種政策，將一無所成，遂極力影響前國務卿貝爾納斯終使我人最後確定絕對反對蘇聯之繼續擴張」。</p>
<p>渠指目前之對華政策「完全違反共和黨之傳統政策」。余深信，最後對將來之和平遠東必更較歐洲爲重要，我人對共產主義在太平洋彼岸之進展，應予以在歐洲者同樣之關切。</p>
<p>〔聯合社大西洋城廿二日電〕共和黨議員周以德廿二日夜宣稱：馬歇爾計劃縱獲成功，仍將分爲兩大陣容，一方面爲蘇聯及其附庸國家，一方面爲美國與西歐十六國，加拿大，澳洲及其他少數國家。美國欲在對蘇政治戰爭中獲勝，則以財政，軍事援華，殊爲必要。中國如沒落，蘇聯將憑藉其第五縱隊，以控制地球上最大部份之人力，且美國僅需支出十五億元不到，即可恢復中國之和平與經濟安全。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿二日電〕前中國行政院長孔祥熙廿二日吿合衆社稱，中國對可能獲得在美國會中之五億七千萬元援助計劃，極表歡迎，然軍事援助猶較此爲重要。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿二日電〕美國第三黨總統候選人華萊士，廿二日發表書面文吿稱：杜魯門總統之援華計劃，具有「挑撥戰爭」性，渠要求美國在華「財政軍事干涉」全盤撤退。渠稱：吾人如以金錢接濟「中國政府，乃吾人在財政軍事上干涉中國之又一階段」。華氏宣稱：政府之援華方案，「乃我國現下外交政策不可避免之失敗之明確，馬歇爾計劃不過爲政策之一部份」。華氏之文吿，係針對杜魯門所作「五億七千萬元代表純粹民事經濟性援助之辯詞」。渠引證所謂「軍事干涉之例子，其中包括美軍官一千人協助訓練十師團軍新兵，在靑島台灣「秘密」興建基地，美海軍「經常」巡　中國海面及二百七十一艘海軍船隻及飛機之移交中國政府」。（編者按：華萊士刻正進行競選。）</p>
<h3>司使論外援　應靠自己處理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕司徒大使廿三日下午三時再度接見記者，重申其對蔣主席及國民政府一貫之支特，司使認爲中國政府與人民應覓獲一共同之理想，則對一切外來之援助，即可得到有效之應用，但外來的援助普通均爲經濟的，最多爲軍事的，政治則須靠自助，即使外援能源源而來，亦非靠自己處理不可。其處理之條件，分政府與人民兩方面，在政府方面，應帮助人民發揮公民權利，同時盡量使人民享受四大自由之權利。在人民方面，更應設法貢獻自己之力量，協助政府完成民主政治。司使更稱：渠曾接觸不少中國人士，如敎授，學生，記者等，彼等對政府均表現有消極或攻擊乃至反對之態度，實則彼等應監督政府，隨時作建設性批評，帮助政府完成民主政治。</p>
<h3>調停亂戰事說　蘇使館已予否認</h3>

<h3>蘆田內閣的前程</h3>
<p>日本片山內臨於本月十“提出總辭後，四黨對下屆首相的提名，經過十日的會商折　，自由黨吉田與民主黨蘆田，均炙手可熱，互不讓步，乃訴諸二十一日國會的提名投票，衆議院選舉結果：蘆田得二百十六票，吉田得一百八十票，片山得八票，蘆田被指名爲內閣首相。參議院二次選舉結果：吉田得一百零四票，蘆田得一百零二票，均朱達二百十八票之過半數。依據日本憲法第六十七條規定，衆院之決議爲議會之決議，所以蘆田雖未獲得票選的壓倒優勢，殆零實已決定其爲下屆首相，乃必然的趨勢。現在，蘆田於　悅中成立了組閣本部，並要召集自由，社會，協同三黨，舉行政策協定會議。蘆田與去年片山紐閣的情形一樣，希望能成立四黨聯立內閣，以四黨政策協定爲新閣施政方針，但據兩日來東京報導，自由黨很難同蘆田台作，甚至民主黨名譽總裁齋藤隆夫，亦有拒絕社會黨左派入閣的表示。頑固的保守的報紙，一致抨擊蘆田與左派合作，蘆田而臨階礁，悲喜交集，他正在坎坷的道路上掙扎，這幾日新閣人事的銓衡，大約比政策協商還重要。本週內是否一帆風順組閣成功，或遭遇任何風險，殊難逆料。</p>
<p>蘆田均，是日本現政治的幸運兒，他以民　黨薄弱的羣衆基礎，議會第三位的少數黨地位，能够在政局棼亂的今天，躍登龍門，一手壓倒吉田，一手握得左派，無疑的，他比樸實的片山更成功，他比長袖的吉田更孚人望。實在說來，蘆田這次的成功，完全是他善於運用環境，能在社會黨與自由黨對立，社會黨左右派矛盾間，以投機取巧的方式，將這些矛盾統一起來，成功了他自己，也提高了民主黨的地位。第一，由於社會黨左右派的分裂，一月十六日社會黨大會通過廢止四黨協定的議案，這使片山內閣失去存在的依據，加以片山哲態度崛强，走中道而不偏左，於是社會黨左派，便以衆院預算委員會的審　　，　　了　　的財　這　案。片山內閣本已面　通貨　　的危機，無載　止，衆院這一擊，便將片山內閣擊倒了。片山內閣的重要支柱爲蘆田，他以外相具有副首相的地位，對片山予以支持，對社會黨右派西尾予以合作，對肚會黨在野左派加　和鈴本，予以同情，他八面玲珊，左右逢源；這次首相提名，社會黨協同黨支持他，國會投票，社會黨協同黨擁護他，所以他能以民主·社會·協同三黨的多數，壓倒自由黨和其他保守黨派，這是蘆田的幸運，這是蘆田的機智。第二，片山於去年六月登台，到他正式擺脫首相職位，爲時僅九個月。此九個月中，片山內閣不斷遭受自由黨的反擊，保守新黨運動的威脅，片山內閣搖搖而不墜者，非片山任事有毅力，亦非社會主養政策有成功，泰半田於蘆田的合作與支持。他會運用智謀應付反政府派，他能於片山彷徨問挺身而出，予片山內閣作有力的援助，所以他能在農相問題上，漁人取利；所以他能在片山總辭後，獲得繼承，所以他能在社會自由兩大矛盾中，投機取巧。蘆田成功的妙訣旣如此，其人，自非偶然之人，平凡之人，如果他組閣成功，其爾後之施政與動向，更値得刮目相看了。</p>
<p>蘆田均其人，生於京都，今年六十一歲。從東京帝大畢業後，即入外務省任事，在歐洲工作約廿年，以『靼韃尼爾海峽之硏究」論文獲得法學博士，其後因有志作政治家而辭去外交官，在故鄕加入政友會作議員候選人，迄去年爲止，前後共當選議員六次。他蜚聲日本文壇，以「日本時報」社長「報知新聞」主筆而兼外交評論家，著作甚豐。當年政友會內訌時，他支持鳩山；自由然成立，他爲該黨的左派，與吉田茂不甚合作。進步黨蛻變爲民主黨，犬養健，楢橋渡，石　　重三主將被整肅，他繳幸而爲民主黨首任總裁，而將右派統帥幣原喜重郞，置於名譽總裁地位，去年幣原復被排擊除名，股問齋藤隆夫任名　總裁，蘆田的不流血革命，獨　了民主黨大　，民主黨並非進步性政黨，擁有少數財閥和封建氣息的地主，但他力　修正的賢本主　，僞裝進步的自由主義；蘆田在戰時曾爲車部效忠，日軍侵華時期，他主持報知新聞，發揮「征服支那」的高論，有『寸鐵殺人批評家」之稱，他的政敵在戰後準備提出整肅，他能以輕快的手腕，遏止整肅事件的發生。日本和約未簽訂，他竟以外相地位發表狂言，要求收回琉球千鳥，引起政界的軒然大波，結果是片山拯救了他，盟總放縱了他。從蘆田其人的經歷，環境，行爲來說，他完全是個有機謀有才幹，能投機能權變的政治家，他無片山的樸實和潔白。今天他滿懷壯志，粉墨登塲，必然的將日本政治倒退一步，反動一步，他的政治基礎是一個舊形態的日本，他可能悍然横決的將日本軍國主義復活起來，這是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>產田組閣的人事部署如何，政策如何，我們不願多作臆測。這裏要指出的，蘆田內閣是片山內閣的　承，它的基礎仍是脆弱的；不過他與片山不同的，是他能包容社會黨左右派爲已用，從而利用社會黨左派，作他的政治基礎。社會黨左派有理想有抱負，也有政治利慾，他們可能作蘆田的尾巴，點綴於不進步而又保守的內閣以內。但蘆田同左派的「黑市交易」，並不能維持長久，由於自由黨保守勢力的壓迫，由於民主黨內部的反對，蘆田可能犧牲左派，保全他自己旣得的政治權益。這些可能性和必然的事實，說明蘆田內閣的保守和反動。</p>
<p>最後必須指出：吉田茂的保守勢力，在政界中日趨上升，這可以自由然衛星之多，和衆院提名投票僅卅六票之差兩事說明。蘆田內閣爲片山內閣的繼承，但她是幣原吉田內閣的延長，因此我們對日本政局觀察的結論是：日本政治又從今天起，倒退了一步。如果蘆田倒了，未來情勢必是吉田繼承。日本政治是步步倒退，節節保守，最後回復到昔日的面目，這與我們希求的日本政治民主化進步化，是距離日趨遼遠了。我們對蘆田的粉墨登塲，作如是觀，對其發展並無深切的重視和期望。</p>

<p>乙，實施辦法　A棉花，（一）貸現收實二萬八千億，每畝以六十萬元計算，佔計可收回皮棉十八萬八千市担。（二）貸現收現七千三百億元，每畝十萬元。B瘀葉一萬四千億，（一）貸現收實一萬二千億，每畝三百萬，估計可收回菸葉五萬担，（二）貸現收現二千億元，每畝一百萬元。C糧食二萬億元，每畝十萬元。D普通農貸，（包括農業生產，農業推廣，副榮晨產連銷，農田水利等），共計二萬二千一百五十億元。E土地金融貸款八千八百三十億元及　麥本位土地券五千零七十五市担，其中包括（一）普通貸款八千一百川億元，（二）綏靖區及黄泛區貸款七百億元及稻麥本位土地儐券五千零七十五萬市担，此項計劃中農行已與張嘉璈商洽，張在原則上已表贊同，並已允上半年由央行撥貸五萬億元，其中普通農貸及土地金融貸款，則希望按原辦法五成核减。</p>
<h3>中央合作金庫　擬定貸款計劃</h3>

<h3>抗戰勝利合灣光復　應歸功於三民主義　孫副主席向台南各界訓詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社台南廿二日電〕孫副主席科今日下午二時在市府禮堂向台南各界致詞稱：台　自割讓日本後，直至抗戰勝利，日本投降，才告光復，此實由於國內幾千萬同胞及合灣愛國志士抗敵犧牲廣獲得。五十年來，國內同胞從未一日忘懷台灣，吾人獲得勝利，光復台灣，自應歸功於三民主義，亦即革命救國最適合於國情之主義。其中民族主義乃主張國家爲全民族所有，絕不容外國壓迫，國家主權屬於全民所有，民權主義即在實行民族政治，人民應有權，利義務，不能受少數野心家壟斷，民生主義端在實行民事，俾各安居樂業，因此三民主義產生力量，國父即以之號召全國，推翻滿淸。其後蔣主席領導北伐，統一國家，七七抗戰，擊敗日本，無非皆由於三民主義精神所感召。我國地大物博，且有賢明之領袖蔣主席，領導全國，自能制勝日本帝國主義。而日本係屬島國，國內則因先大不足，且乏眼光遠大之政治領袖，乃走上失敗之路，將來和約訂立後，絕不容其再有武力遺存，使往昔之讀武主義不復抬頭。反觀吾國，則兼有光明前途，今後全國同胞，務須自信，一切困難，自可克服，而面臨共匪之叛亂，二三年內即可戡定。至於對日和約問題，凡未經中國同意之和約，絕對不能成立，今後爭取眞正和平，固較戰爭獲勝猶爲困難，惟深信此項困難，定能克服，中華民國在世界上地位定可提高。最後希望全國同胞一致信仰三民主義，信任政府，擁護最高領袖蔣主席，同心同德，共同建設國家，復興中華民族。</p>
<h3>我赴美移民問題　雙方訂定兩要項</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕關於赴美移民事項，中美觀點不同，僑委會迭請外交部與美政府洽商，茲悉近訂要點如下：（一）美國政府對於各國移民赴美，認係美國內政問題，具有審核之權，外交部所發之移民護照，自須經美方簽證後，始得列入移民定額之內。（二）外交部前通知駐華美國大使館，凡經該部核發之護照，其中註明「Emigrant」字樣者，應請列入移民定額計算，其持有其他一般護照赴美者，不計在定額移民之內，美大使館已予同意。至美籍華僑軍人由華携帶返美之華籍妻室子女，如未經外交部發給移民護照，自不應視爲定額移民，外交部已再函達美大使館。</p>

<p>〔中央社馬尼刺廿三日電〕我駐菲公使陳質平，今向菲副總統兼外長季里諾提出另一照會，再度要求一月廿五日自馬尼刺公共市塲被逐出之華僑攤販應准予復業。僉信照會中指出在菲律賓最高法院之判決交下以前，市塲之華僑攤販，已被强行驅逐，最高法院判決中，證明馬尼刺地方法院確係決心反對中國僑民，而此種行爲，足以證實目前菲律賓確有反華之趨向。照會中設明，在一月廿五日以前，貨攤空額共有三百五十一個，菲當局在未將空額補滿之前，即行逐出華僑攤販，此點與公共市塲菲化法案中予菲律賓人以「優先」權利之主要目標，實不相符合。照會中復說明，在馬尼刺七個主要市塲中，共有貨攤九千四百四十九個，華僑所佔者僅四百五十三個，合百分之五，而目前有貨攤五百零七個，尙無人經營。陳公使定明晨與羅哈斯總統會晤，洽商市塲貨　事件，及其他有關中菲關係之未決問題。陳氏原定今日與羅哈斯會談，後因故稽延一日。</p>

<h3>東北耆宿之乎籲　上接一版</h3>
<p>平津東北人士　提供意見六點</p>
<p>（一）東北兩年以來，每天皆在大量破壞之中，農村破產，工礦殘毁，已無國計民生之可言，行政方面，則機關龐雄，軍民股節，社會秩序，已趨紊亂，而所轄地區，日見縮小，整個東北人民，已陷於無力自拔之慘刧，不能不大聲疾呼，請政府予以澈底之革新。</p>
<p>（二）亟待解決之問題，而食糧之缺乏，瀋陽二百餘萬人民，已有五分之一，每天以）豆併豆渣充飢，加以四鄕難民，陸續逃入城　，如運輸不通，全城人民即有斷炊之處。日前局面，僅剩殘點零綫，而流通券發行額數，已在萬億。敵僞時代僞鈔價格與臺路相等，收復以後，台幣與法幣之比價，由一與卅之比，至一與百餘之比，東北則始終爲一與十之比，且禁止法幣出關，只有匯率，並無比率，相形之下，所差十倍，不能不請中央予以補救，加以緊急之處理。</p>
<p>（三）東北軍事現狀，已至嚴重階段，目前焦點，在如何採取有效之援助，支持得住。現有之據點，必須保持，再謀增强實力及有效之處置。</p>
<p>（四）東北問題，決非一隅之利害得失，是整個國家之問題。東北放棄，反政府之力量，必大量增加。數十萬甚至數百萬之武力，立即攻入熱察，華北現有之力量，一定抵擋不住，如華北不保，敵人集有東北與華北之人力物力，長驅南下，大江以南，亦將同樣不守。今日鞏固華北，即是保全江南，爭取東北，亦即保持華北，此不能不向全國人士呼籲，正視東北事實，有共同一致之認識。中國整個局面，萬一爲强權暴力所持，安南，緬甸，印度，南洋各處，亦將發生同樣之影響，而整個世界之和平，受其威脅，故東北問題，亦則世界之問題。</p>
<p>（五）爲支援東北，保持現有之局面，應儘先打通楡瀋交通路綫，又必須立即集中增强華北之武力，方能就近相機，予一有效之應付。</p>
<p>（六）以東北之人力物力，善加利用，本可成爲安定中國之偉大力量，不幸被迫而爲人利用，反成一集團之暴力，是最痛心之事，東北靑年，屢經變亂，多屬熱心愛國之士，保衛鄕土之念最强，如中央能有適當之辦法，相信定能負起保衛家國之責。同人等認爲時機危迫，情形嚴重，爲東北呼籲，亦即爲整個之國家呼籲，同樣亦願促起世界愛好和平人士，予以正義之援助。</p>
<p>張氏並作個人補充云：今日之東北問題，已非放棄不放棄問題，蓋政府如有解決辦法，則戰事之得失，並不足道。今日之問題，實爲放得下放不下問題，你一旦放下，別人即將取去，如東北一失。一月至三月內，華北亦必不保，此在東北及華北方面，人人如此看法，即軍事負責常局亦如此。同人等此來，即是希大家對東北之重要有深切之認識，此亦爲東北人民之共同希望。</p>
<p>目前東北問題　關係整個世界</p>
<p>繼由南京東北同鄕會常務理事王德溥致詞。略謂：東北問題，在東北人之看法，在華北人之看法及在京滬綫人士之看法，容有不同，然昨晚與馬氏等及各地同鄕會談後之結果，對東北之意見，已趨一致，蓋目前全國以至全世界對東北之重要性皆有同樣認識，而東北急切之圖，厥爲如何保衛東北及保持現有之殘破點綫，設如犧牲東北，能有利於全國及世界，則吾人不情將東北犧牲。然東北之得失，今已爲我國家及整個世界之安寗和平關鍵，故我人必須以全力保衛東北。　旋由黑龍江省主席韓駿傑報吿東北近况云：東北之危機，今日已臨最後關頭，許多人眼看東北不保，本人向來樂觀，對東北問題，幷不如此悲觀，然而如無有效的辦法去做，則當然悲觀。這幾年來，東北措施，顚三倒四，初步錯於迷信外交，二錯於經濟措置，三錯於和談，大錯之外，加以行政及人事上之許多小錯，東北遂有今日之糟。此種責任，人人管有。現在亦不必細究。今後必須努力如何爭取將失之東北，如再有錯誤，必失無疑。如經濟問題，流通券發行數字驚人，而流通之區，僅若千不完整之縣份及村落，物價　不得漲？東北需要物資，而交通困難，運　成問題，以致糧食及日用品皆缺少，人民負担加重，致影響及軍事。故欲軍事有開展，經濟問題非先解決不可。至於軍事問題，韓氏云，當初陳總長出題，韓氏曾提建議，剿匪重點必須放在東北，東北爲中國屛　，如東北匪亂肅淸，關內匪亂必亦解決。東北諺語云：「關起來打瞎子」，豈有不消滅之理。最後韓氏希望京滬新聞界動輿論呼翅，引起國際注意，如東北不保，全世界將因此改觀。美國以爲歐洲第一，此一觀點太簡單，蘇聯重視亞洲，因歐洲有限制，而亞洲有無限制之人力及物力，一且亞洲入蘇聯手掌，全世界必受威脅。現政府必須拿出決心來，在東北之公務員，決不能撤退，必須向前拚，以全力保衛東北。目前東北之人力及物力，尙無問題，可以一拚故軍事須要統籌辦理，要以充裕之軍力，一舉而擊減共匪。去年春天，只需多添一個軍，去年夏天，只需多添二個軍，即可充裕剿滅共匪，故對付共匪，不能小本經營，小本經營，則一點一點，只有被共匪消耗。至內地之行政經濟措施，目前決不能同樣推行於東北，東北必須簡化行政，集中力量於剿匪軍事。</p>
<p>張元夫韓駿傑　解答記者詢問</p>
<p>上海東北同鄕會理事史炳炎致詞云。只有簡單的幾個字，希望軍民不要脫節。</p>
<p>各記者隨即提出數項問題，請張元夫及韓駿傑兩氏解答。關於具體之糧食恐慌，及軍力不足問題，張氏答云：糧食如交通解決，即無問題，而軍力端在子彈及人力，人力在華北訓練五萬十萬，不成問題，缺的乃是子彈，故在力量有限之情形下，必須集中用於有效之處。韓氏又以事實提供解答糧食恐慌問題，謂：據其所知，葫蘆島現有各“地運到之糧食，足够瀋陽市民及附近各部隊三月所需，然因交通問題，不能運去。故軍事局面，如果稍有打開，交通綫能保持，則糧食就無問題。張氏又答某記者所提張學良出山之說，據云：東北人民未考慮到此點，東北人民服從政府命令，不論政府將取何種辦法，東北人民皆願服從。</p>
<p>最後，張元夫氏總結三點意見：（一）希望大家多加宣傳，呼籲全國人士重視東北。（二）華北力量非增强不可，華北可以有訓練之人力補充東北，此爲最有效之辦法。（三）若東北放棄，必將有一組織出現，此組織爲何種組織，其影響於世界和平者，亦人人皆可想像得出。</p>

<h3>倫敦會議昨揭幕　三國商談西德各項問題　會議進行情形暫不公布</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿三日電〕英美法三國會議今日在此間開幕，將商討自去年倫敦外長會議破裂後懸而未決之德國經濟問題，蘇聯未受邀請。會議中所謀取解決之五項主要問題爲：（一）比利時荷蘭與盧森堡之參加會議問題；（二）法佔領區與英美佔區之合併問題，（三）魯爾區之處理問題，（四）德國之邊界問題；（五）日後德國之參加馬歇爾計劃間題。按蘇聯對此會議曾提出抗議，謂決不承認會議中任何決定，英法對之未予答覆，美國則拒絕蘇聯之抗議，謂是項會議實屬必要者。美國代表團將由美駐英大使道格拉斯領導。官方雖未正式宣佈，僉信比·荷·盧三國衹少將局部參加會議。由於法國政局之不穩，三國決定會議秘密進行。</p>
<p>此間美國方面稱：雖則必需用美金避免法佔區之赤化，然華盛頓方面不欲以之「威脅」法國參加三區協定。美國方面認爲荷比等國不必參加三區談判，蓋此純爲三佔區之行政問題也。然美國深信如無荷比等國之參加，不能解決其他任何問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕外交界負責官員聲稱：美國在三國會議中，將然作依照馬歇爾計劃在西德居於主要地位。英法兩國願意合作，但以嚴格保證防止德國武力之再起條件。此種安全問題必將優先討論。英國因此建議與法荷比盧等隊國，訂立政治與軍事同盟。法荷比盧四國對此在原則上雖表示贊成，但認爲須切實保體各國將來能合作防止任何方面之侵略。英國為適應此項要求起見，已允荷比盧三國得對西德會議提供意見，惟以右關西德一般政策問題為限，而不及於管理問題。一般政策問題有三：（一）重新建設德國工業。此種工業極易變而為軍需生產，應如何加以預防。（二）國際共管魯爾煤鐵區。關於此點，法國要求國際共管，英國主張採取某種國營方式，美國則主張採取自由企業制度。（三）德國政體援用中央集權制，抑如法國所建議組織聯邦，實行地方分權，而無軍事團結力量。荷比盧三國對此態度，於西德前途關係甚巨，此事明日或可分曉。各該國均以安全保障爲先決條件，法國顯亦抱壞態度。法外長皮桿爾會謂，安全必須先有保障，然後法國始允以其佔領區與英美佔領區合併。</p>
<h3>杜魯門週內將提出　援助希土新估計　大部份用於軍械及配備</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕政府官員廿三日稱：杜魯門總統將在本週內以新的援助希土之估計提交國會。此一「防共」計劃之第二部份，現正由預算局繕擬中。確定之數字尙未獲悉，然據一般跡象，總統之要求在三億五千萬至二億七千五百萬元之間，大多數爲軍械及配備。根據目前之四億元計劃，希臘陸軍得一億七千二百萬元，土耳其則得一億元。同時國會領袖已接近協議，策動衆院表決此計劃，而由參院辯論歐洲復興計劃及五億七千萬元援華計劃。參議院將審査希土計劃，而其時則由衆院辯論援歐案。現尙無計劃建議派美軍赴希進剿遊擊隊。</p>
<h3>法總統呼籲　組世界同盟</h3>

<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾廿二日電〕比總理史巴克今日在京郊工業區安特萊許特之集會中致辭，對英法之建議西歐團結，表示歡迎，並認西歐聯盟之組織並無惡意，正如渠對東歐之普結同盟互助條約，亦不反對相同。</p>
<h3>土反保示威</h3>

<p>〔路透社開羅廿三日電〕埃及總理諾克拉茜，今日向記者表示，渠覺蘇丹總督霍威爵士向英挨政府所提關於蘇丹憲政改革之修正命令草案，殊不健全。諾克拉茜此外不願表示任何意見。該草案擬在蘇丹設立立法議會及行政委員會，以分別替代現有的北蘇丹顧間委員會及諮詢地位的總督委員會。</p>

<h3>防止聖地戰爭　英擬就新方案</h3>
<p>猶太公會譴責英態度</p>
<p>〔合衆社黎巴嫩廿三日電〕可靠方面稱：英國已建議一避免巴勒斯坦戰爭之方案，阿拉伯總司令凱匯佳業已同意停止全面攻勢，惟此項「和平建議」之條件未予公佈，但該方面稱，該方案可供使華盛頓倫敦及成功湖之參考，以草擬一新巴勒斯坦計劃，可能爲分治計劃外之另一辦法，但不致損害聯合國之威望，且亦能避免戰爭及中東安全之危險不爲蘇聯所算。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿二日電〕聯合國安理會定於星期二討論是否願造成先例，派遣國際軍執行巴勒斯坦分治案，其決議有關聯合國前途甚大。猶太公會特於今日向安理會提出備忘錄，指斥英國優容阿拉伯人反對分治，其在巴勒斯坦之中立態度，削弱猶太防務，並嚴重威脅和平。</p>
<h3>日新首相選舉程序完成　蘆田積極組新閣　閣僚名單大體業已擬定</h3>

<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕日蘆田新內閣組閣工作今日開始，但除對各黨首領作形式上之拜會外，並無其他會談，正式協商將有待於今後之民·社·國三黨代表會議。目前就閣僚分配數目問題，民社兩黨間尙有進出，民主黨方面主張：民八，社七，國二。而社會黨則主張以各黨所佔衆院議席爲比例，應爲：社八，民七，國二。雖兩黨之間僅一席之差，然一般認爲此項問題，頗難妥協。又據蘆田內閣組閣本部透露消息稱：蘆田內閣名單大致已擬定，惟尙待與社，國兩黨作最後之決議，民主黨方面入閣者除蘆田均以首相兼任外相之外，計有一松定吉（連任），木村小左衛門（未定），栗栖赳夫（連任），北村德太郞（安本或商工又或農林），竹田儀一（遞信），苫米地義三（內閣秘書長），稻葉平太郞或櫻內義雄（國務相）（九人中選七人）；希望社會然方面入閣者：片山哲或西尾末廣（以副首相資格任外相），水谷長三郞（安本或商工），森戶辰男（連任），鈴木義勇（連任），加藤堪十（勞動或安本），其餘一人或二人，將邀在永江一夫，富吉榮二或伊藤卯四郞選擇，至於野溝勝氏，因此次首相提名投票時未投蘆田票，故決不邀彼入閣。希望國協黨方面入閣者計三木武夫或船田享二，及岡田勢一，倘三木不入閣，則以船田及岡田二人入閣。</p>
<h3>自由黨決定不參加新閣</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕日自由黨總裁吉田昨日繼該黨最高幹部會讓後，又召開一般工作人黃會議，決議事項如下：（一）拒絕參加蘆田之聯合內團，明日所屬議員總會後決發表聲明；（二）新黨工作仍積極進行，爲使此項工作進行順利起見，決先解救自由黨，希望在二月底以前組織成功。至於新黨名稱，將由參加新組織之各派代表共同協商，惟可能採用「民主自由黨」名稱，新黨政策正由自由黨方面擬訂中，一兩日內即可完成，將來亦由各派共同決定。</p>
<h3>我指控板垣　導演傀儡戲</h3>
<p>誘使汪精衛溥儀組僞政府</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿三日電〕我檢察官向哲濬今在國際軍事法庭指控戰犯板垣征四郞，應對一九三九年汪精衛逃離重慶及瀋陽事變後，一九三二年溥儀之私離天津，負其完全責任。向氏聲稱：「傀儡組織」乃板垣愛用之策略，以遂行其對東北與中國其他地區之經濟剝削與政治控制之陰謀。向氏稱板垣曾令注精衛假「和平」之名出任「南京僞政府」之頭目，前此復會誘使在　織，藉獨立之名出任「偽滿州國政府」之傀儡。</p>
<h3>捷京滿佈武裝警察　共黨蓄意攫取政權　貝奈斯仍擬試組聯合內閣</h3>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格廿三日電〕共黨廿三日發動三面攻勢，以獲取捷克政權。共產黨已武裝普拉格之警察，佔領國家社會黨之總部，並禁止捷克公民之國外旅行。携有新武器之警察廿三日晨在街道上出現，蓋共黨企圖由國會中攫取政權之和平方法已由貝奈斯總統之拒絕而失敗矣。</p>
<p>上述三種措置均由共然內長諾西克下令執行者。渠又下令逮捕在去年年底辭職被控賣國之前斯洛伐克民主黨副總理烏拉辛。一般僉認國外旅行之禁令，及警察常局之控吿烏拉辛，乃共黨總理，戈德華攫取完全控制政府計劃之一部份，冀圖成立一「鐵幕」式之「警察國家」。共黨之工會領袖支持戈　華呼籲各工廠於廿四日舉行一小時總罷工，若彼等之要求不能達到，並總罷工僵化全國相威脅。共黨之罷工呼籲中，包括要求依共黨路綫改變憲法，完成各工業之國營化。僉認此乃協助戈德華與貝奈斯總統作戰之行動。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格廿三日電〕捷古總統貝奈斯於昨日下午返捷京後，曾與各政界人物談判，但關於此事尙未有官方情報發表。惟據某政界人士宣佈，共然不反對組成包括各黨各派之新內閣，但爲增强其在內閣之地位，使渠等不常時仰仗社會民主黨之支持起見，聞共黨設法在新閣中包括工會及其他服從共黨命令之全國大組織之代表在內。同一方面消息又　，共黨雖不反對天主敎黨之團員再加入內閣，但渠等將拒絕與社會主義民族黨合作。傳共黨總理戈德華將在社會主養民族黨中選擇最後能參加內閣之領袖入閣。</p>

<h3>蘇聯紀念紅軍節　陸長勗勉將士備戰不懈</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕莫斯科電台廣播蘇聯軍令部長布爾加寗元帥於蘇聯陸軍建軍三十週年紀念前留夕發表之告將士書，其中表示在帝國主義存在期間，蘇聯本國即隨時有被攻擊之危險。蘇陸軍將士必須隨時在準備狀態之中，不惜代價及在任何條件之下，雜護蘇聯之榮譽及利益。</p>
<p>三十年前，布爾雪維克黨及蘇聯人民之領袖列寗及史達林獲得社會革命之最大勝利後，蘇維埃陸海軍即隨之建立。蘇維埃政府堅決執行其愛好和平的外交政策，為進步勢力之先鋒，以為合理持久的和平及國際安全而奮鬥。史達林之公正政策深得各人民民主國以及全世界各和平自由的友人所支持。蘇聯軍隊即担任保衛此項政策之任務，在戰後時期，蘇軍在軍事及政治訓練方而繼續獲有成就，但不可因此轉趨鬃懈，蘇軍決不可放棄履行當前義務之任何努力。布爾加寧元帥並下令於蘇陸軍三十週年紀念日，在莫斯科。各蘇維埃共和國首都及其他若干城市，鳴禮砲三十響。莫斯科於夜間施放熖火，各戲院均上演與紅軍有關之劇本。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄（十）（三）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>下屬對上司不能同心協力</p>
<p>一九四三年八月間，羅斯福總統啓程赴魁貝克之前，他請韋爾斯辭去副國務卿之職。他呌韋爾斯到他白宮中的辦公室去，把這一點向他說明。</p>
<p>在以前幾個星期中，總統和我曾經談過韋爾斯的問題不止一次。我們同意韋爾斯應該辭職，派他到國外去担任一椿特別任務，負責有關這椿任務的新工作。</p>
<p>副國務卿韋爾斯所引起的問題中之若干種，我不願意詳細敍述，因爲如此做法並無意義可言。這些問題二三年來不斷在增加中。一九四二年一月間的里約熱內盧會議，表現了他的一種態度，而這種態度對於我並不是新奇的——那是就他隨時準備作重要的決定，並不徵詢我的意見。</p>
<p>從我們最初相處之時起，我總設法給他合理的自由去執行他的工作。我常呌他直接去見總統，特別是我在國務院中分身不開的時候，並且呌他去和總統處理正由他在辦理的事情。這是和我的方針相符合的，那就是接近我的同事，副國務卿，參事和助理國務卿應該自己去看總統處理各種特殊事項，衹要我知這就可以了。我覺得這種偶然的接觸可以給他們更多的經騐，更大的成望以及對工作更深的興趣，並且可以减輕我繁重的負祖中的一部份，這種負担，特別在我們正在經歷的困難時日中，沉重地壓在國務卿的肩上。</p>
<p>但是我發覺韋爾斯濫用還種特權，有時候到總統那裏去，並不給我知道，甚至想獲致一個決定，也不給我知道。這種傾向所以發生的一部份原因，或許是爲了羅斯福先生和韋爾斯在家庭關係上就是老朋友，在社會和學校方面，出身相同</p>
<p>在歐洲戰爭日益走向爆發之路去的一個時期中，國務院中的公事一個月比一個月積得高，於是我就核准韋爾斯去接見希望到國務院來訪問的許多或者大多數大使和公使。當然，凡是要見我的所有外交代表，我總設法接見的，並且對於重要事務，我總和他們保持接觸。此外，爲了重要問題，韋爾斯應該把外國代表帶到我這裏來，或者呌他們自己來見我。</p>
<p>最後道一點我不久發覺他在許多情形之下並不照辦，雖然我曾經申說明白，就是在這種情形之下，我務必接見這些代表，不管我怎樣繁忙。後來，當一位重要大使徇我之請來看我而我要他再來繼續討論時，他立即舉起他的雙手，並且說我要先同韋爾斯先生談過。這種情形逐漸地但是不斷地愈來愈深刻化了。</p>
<p>我開始注意到韋爾斯正和我們的外交人員以及其他政府的官吏作私人的通信，這種工作照例是應該經由國務院的官方途徑辦理的。他時常把個人的照會送給他們，請他們作個人的答覆，而實際上這種事情是應該用國務院的照會照常規辦理的。這驪辦法的不良影響，乃是他把許多談判或者討論的項目，掌握在他自巳手裏，而這種事情，照例應該讓我和國務院直接有關官員更明瞭其一般情形的。</p>
<p>一九四二年晚春，韋爾斯就外交問題發表了兩篇演說，其中有使我國政府走上外交政策新路綫的傾向。更眾要的一次，是在阿靈頓公墓紀念日發表的，討論我們戰後的計劃，當時莫洛托夫外長適在美國訪問。在這兩次演說中，韋爾斯事前對於他的新見解都沒有和我商量過。</p>
<p>一九四二年六月二十日，我叫　爾斯到我辦公室來，向他指出一點，就是沒有一個副國務卿或者助理國務卿曾經有過提出任何程度的新外交政策的職權的，這種職權，現在也絕不存在。要使國務卿和副國務卿當做兩個領袖互相協調工作，或者單由副國務卿來負責這椿任務，這種嘗試所造成的情勢，我一刻也不能加以允准。</p>
<p>我還說，按照國務院明白規定的規則，沒有一個副國務卿或者助理國務卿可以爲了任何官方的事務直接去見總統，除非總統關照，或者是國務卿所知悉和准許的。對於這一點，沒有一個人比韋爾斯本人明瞭得更淸楚。我說我給予他到白宮去的空前權利，可能是我這方面的錯誤，因爲據我所知，他的前任中沒有一個人，有過這種特權。</p>
<p>韋爾斯回答說，他不知道在他的演說中曾經闡述過新外交政策。繼而他說，鑒於我所說的話，今後他將完全停止發表演說。</p>
<p>我答覆他說，他發表的演說很精彩，我希望他甚至發表一百篇來支持戰爭；在他的演說中應該避免新外交政策這個問題，乃是我所唯一想到的東西，除非我們事前獲致同意的，則屬例外。</p>
<p>使我奇怪的是，韋爾斯直到談話終結時爲止，還是把兩種完全不同的演說，混爲一談，並且堅持以後不再發表任何演說了。還有一點使我奇怪的，乃是他說在他某一次和總統談話時，後者曾表示他自已並不希望就戰後問題發表任何演說，但是政府中其他人員來發表幾篇作爲試探氣球倒也無妨。</p>
<p>我回答說韋爾斯並沒有吿訴我他和總統舉行過這次談話，再者，這一點和他最初所力辯的根本沒有覺得提起過新外交政策的說法，前後實不相符。</p>
<p>我們的談話暫時有澄淸空氣的效果。後來韋爾斯仍舊就外交問題發表演說的，但是事前先和我商量。但是他並不停止越過我直接到總統那裏去的辦法。我對他不寄予同樣的信仰，猶如我對其他的同事那樣。</p>
<p>我覺得不論韋爾斯在外交方面的敎育和訓練如何，他對於若干重要間題和政策的見解，比我其他的同事來得狹窄和不够健全。在歐洲發生戰爭之前，我們對於武裝干涉古巴以及對慕尼黑會議結果的估量，意風不同。在戰爭發生之後，我們對於西半球中立地帶以及建議中的對日哀的美敦書，意見互殊，這個衰的美敦書是羅斯福和邱吉爾在大西洋會議中所同意的，在起草的時候，韋爾斯是一個顧問。我覺得這個文吿可能在那時候就對日戰爭發生，當時我們還沒有珍珠港事件發生時來得有準備。在珍珠港事件之後，我們對於在里約熱內盧會議上處理阿根廷問題的辦法，他的演說的性質以及戰後國際安全機構的組織，意見不相一致。</p>
<p>這種意見上的出入，有時是由於思想不同，有時是爲了對處理重大問題的更切實有效的方法，意見柄鑿，至於韋爾斯常常不願意和我同心協力，不必說了。這種情形，在他服務國務院的後半時期中，特別尖銳，而對我們這輩協力工作的人，頗有妨礙。</p>
<p>在若干年中，我很希望韋爾斯以儘可能最有效的方法監督國務院的行政工作，這是副國務卿的正常任務，因此可以讓國務卿以更多的時間用於政策的訂定方面。但是韋爾斯似乎爲其他的事情大爲分心，結果國務院中可以表示意見的人，都對於他處理行政工作的結果，深表失望。在史坦汀紐斯担任副國務卿之後，我就責成他把國務院的行政工作完全改組。</p>
<p>總統本人也開始體驗到韋爾斯對我不忠誠的程度。他對於韋爾斯發表阿靈頓公墓演說特別不滿，訴說不止一次，因為他事前和我們兩人中的任何一人都沒有商量過。他對我說他後來曾就這篇演說，向韋爾斯勸導一番。有一次他吿訴我韋爾斯曾向他提出」個建議，要求派他去祖任一椿規定的任務，至於這椿任務的性質如何，總統並沒有提起。羅斯福先生對於韋爾斯提出這項建議之前未曾和我商量過這一點，予以嚴峻批評。</p>
<p>我可以到總統那裏去解決韋爾斯問題，堅主他在韋爾斯和我之間作一抉擇。但是我一向是習慣與和人家合作，不習慣於反對人家的。國務院的工作現在非常龐雜，韋爾斯是一個奮力工作者，假如他能在忠誠的基礎上服務，我寗願加以利用，願加以丢棄。</p>
<p>但在一九四三年初夏，總統自己發覺國務院這種情形不能再繼續下去。他自己決定一點，就是依現行各種情形觀之—詳情無需提出—國務院的效能可因韋爾斯的辭職而提高。他和我同意韋爾斯的解職應該使他好受一點，那就是由總統表示願意派他以旅行大使的資格，到南美或者蘇聯去祖任一椿特別任務。</p>
<p>當總統要求他辭職時，就向韋爾斯提出這個建議，向他指出他因此可以離開國務院而不致引起無謂的猜測。</p>
<p>對於這個建議，韋爾斯並沒有給總統一個肯定的答覆。在他和羅斯福先生談過之後，立即到我的辦公室來。他表示他的信念，以爲總統這樣辦法是出諸我的意思。我吿訴他全部事實，包括總統是經過他自己深思熟慮之後才這樣辦的這一點在內，不管他這樣做法是否由於我任何建議的結果。</p>
<p>於是我就敦促他接受總統派他担任特別任務的建議，特別提到在莫斯科的一次會議。韋爾斯用一種堅定的語氣立即回答說，這樣去跑一趟不能有所收獲。他不久就立起來，到我的辦公桌旁，和我握手，於是就走了。從此以後，我就沒有和他講過話。</p>
<p>我不久就去參加魁貝克會議。韋爾斯到緬甸去。他並沒有接受担任總統特別任務的建議，寫了辭呈，從緬甸郵寄到白宮。</p>

<h3>參議大會議長致開幕辭　策動督促戡亂行憲　維持地方治安市民應共負責　市政建設首當安定民生</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會第一屆第五次大會，於昨晨九時半在塘沽路該會大禮堂隆重揭幕，出席參議員一六三人。除市長及市府各局局長等列席外，江蘇　察使嚴莊，地方法院院長査良鑑，師管區司令傅正謨等均參加。</p>
<p>揭幕禮開始，由主席潘議長致開幕詞，語多沉痛警惕。旋由吳市長及參議員代表費樹聲相繼致詞。</p>
<p>十時許開始舉行第一次會議，秘書長報吿，討論議事日程後，由吳市長報吿施政。下午未舉行會議。今日下午二時至六時舉行第二次會議，又財政，教育，地政等局長之工作報吿，然後由參議員對各該局提出質詢，由局長答覆。</p>
<p>潘議長致開會辭稱：「今天本會舉行第五次會議，適當卅七年春季開始之際，「一年之計在於春」，相信本會同仁沒有一位不感覺責任格外重大。公展忝任議長，首願一述個人之所感，以就正於餚君。</p>
<p>就國家大局言：今年是國家行憲之年，也應該是撥亂反正之年。蔣主席指示我們：「戡亂與行憲，爲建國工作一事之兩面，戡亂可以排除憲政之障碍，而行憲可以樹立民主之把握」。本會爲中國最大都市之民意機關，自當率先樹立本市民主政治之規模，而同時亦須善盡職責，直接間接，推動市民，督促政府，致力於戡亂，以排除憲政之障碍。但無論行憲或戡亂，人民最基本的要求衹是生存與生活。目前戰亂區域的人民已感到生存的威脅，後方的人民，亦已感到生活的威脅。所以卑之無甚高論，人民目前希望的起碼條件衹有「安居樂業」四個大宇而已。然而人民如何可以安居樂業呢？最近美國駐華大使司徒雷登博十說：「中國不少大公無私的人，他們如果能有效結合起來，宣揚人民的意志，他們當可協助政府，爲國家造福。他又說：「中國今日已有憲法以確定國是之軌範，人民在憲法下，如能貢默自己的力量，即可協助政府完成現代之民主化之制度。」本會爲本市的民意機關，本會同仁是市民的代表，即負有宣揚人民意志的責任，亦即應該大公無私的有效結合起來，在憲法開始實施之今日，將真正的民意向政府當局表示，使政府隨時隨地能尊重真正的民意，以爲施政之準繩，則敢信不但安居樂業一定可以獲得保陣，即國家大局的嚴重危機亦未始不可挽救。美國國務卿馬歇爾將軍也曾再三說過：「中國問題的主要解決辦法，大部份須　中國人本身努力」。我們復有同感。他所謂「中國人本身」者，當然不僅指中國政府的官吏而言，我們人民也個個在內。顧炎武先生有句名言：「天下興亡，匹夫有責。」今天的大局，真已到了天下興亡的關頭了，做國民的人人有責，也該人人起來負責。何况上海是中國最大的有國際性的都市，而本會同仁又是這個最大都市的市民代表，我們至少要對於市民安居樂業的最低希望有所建議，有所貢獻。擴而充之，我們對於國家的政制，今後如何更能廣開言路，延攬人才，崇尙法治，實踐民主，以達到撥亂反正的目的，也不宜局限地方，妄自菲薄，而應該振臂一呼，積極邁進，負起策動督促的責任。上海這個地方，不比尋常，上海市民的一言一動，全國視聽所繫，治亂所關，實在太大，此本會同仁不能不持以兢兢自勉者一。</p>
<h3>編練地方武力保衛生命財產</h3>
<p>就本市治安言：最近一個月來，好像社會近乎有些浮動，上月底本月初，五天之內，連續發生了學生毆辱市長，舞業搗毁社會局，和申新九廠覇佔工廠抗拒軍警三件不大不小的破壞秩序的事故，幸賴吳市長，宣司令，社會局吳局長，警察局兪局長等主管長官應付有方，處理得當，始能消弭禍患不致擴大。而共匪丁錫山一股竄擾本市郊區外圍，亦因軍隊和鄰縣地方團隊在宣司令指揮之下，嚴密配合，機動圍勦，得以迅速撲滅。本會同仁爲全市治安設想，不能不首先對地方長官，深致感慰之意。惟是地方治安之維持，秩序之整肅，在今天的局勢之下，已不能專事責望於政府，而應由人民共負其責。如何使本市基層自治之保甲機構，更受政府之重視，更有嚴密之組訓，以協助偵緝，防杜奸宄之效？如何依照中央法令，趕急籌集的款，編練地方自衛武力，協助國軍保衛家鄉，以地方之兩精款項，養地方之團練民兵，以地方之團練民兵，衛地方之生命財產，在今日已爲　切急要之事。蓋必如此而後可以遏流寇，可以保地方，可以有助於戡亂，本會同仁目擊時局之靼危，社會之動盪，不能不急起直追，發動民力，協助政府，以完成其維護治安之任務者二。</p>
<h3>對今後市政建設應重點主義應重點主義</h3>
<p>就市政建設言：在此物價高昂，庫帑支絀之際，一切建設似乎不能不採取甫點主義，否則樣樣要做，件件想辦，而結果將感到百廢俱舉，一事無成。假使此一前提爲不謬，則公展以爲本會審査市政府之支出預算時，同仁宜一概開各人自已局部的立塲，而爲全市整個作一打算，那件事宜先辦，那件事常緩辦，那些事應由市辦，那些事可聽區辦，不妨有一適度之衡量。本年度之市政，究應安置其重點於何處，固有待於市府當局之提議，與本會同仁之研討，而其不能不有中心有中心工作，則固無可懷疑。在公展的淺見，以爲不論政府有何種建設，首當力求民生的安定。此時此地，一切的一切，要以安定爲第一，先安定而後再求進步，先安定而後再求繁榮。戰亂時期的人民，只求先在安定的環境中討一生活而已！惟安定而後可以言建設；亦惟安定而後可以言民主，故凡一切良好的設施，任何動聽的舉措，假使無補於民生的安定，或有碍於社會的安定，或甚而至於可以隱播亂源，無異製造社會的動盪，則無論中央或地方，爲大局着想，寗可在本市暫行緩辦；切忌好高鶩遠，標新立異，事情尙未舉辦，而人民已苦其苛擾。古人所切引爲戒的，「苛政猛於虎」這句話，就是這個意思！</p>
<h3>人民此時無奢望但求除生活威脅</h3>
<p>其次，人民此時並無奢望，但求政府能够消極的爲他們减除若干生活的咸脅，於願已足，譬如：糧食乃至其他日常必需品能够逐漸都有大公無私的配售；房租標準能够調整得比較合理，同時市府能够逐漸有若干廉價的平民住屋的供應，使收入低微的市民不愁付不出房租；崎嶇泥濘的道路能够稍稍塡平；堆積汚穢的垃圾能够漸漸出淸；公共車輛能够酌量加多班次輛數而不常常漲價；常喝汚水的地方，也有若干自來水公共龍頭可以供應飲水；邊僻的郊區也有公共電話，可以應付急切的需要；用電儘可自動節約，而不必有駭人的罰款，或不致當常停電影響生產；多設幾個公立的中心小學，使家長們不致因無力爲其子女繳費而有讀書無門，望校興嘆之感，一切違章犯法之徒，都受到法律的公平制裁，而不使無辜良民遭受法外的迫害，喪失他們應享的自由權利；稅收能够切實整頓，剔除中飽，而不必專從提高稅率上打主意。……諸如此類，在一個起碼的現代國家裏，現代都市裏，人民都感覺有迫切的需要，有主張的權利。衹須政府當局能够周察民隱，在力所能及的範圍內，盡心竭力的認眞幹去，相信雖無多大足以誇耀的建設，但一定可以得到本會同仁與全市市民眞誠擁護的與合作。本會同仁處於市民代表的地位，不能不表達民意的期待，爲减除人民痛苦作呼籲，而極願與政府合作以期改善者三。</p>
<h3>有權和就有義務應納國稅服兵役</h3>
<p>最後，公展更欲率直奉吿吾全市同胞者，即吾市民有權利，同時也有其義務。司徒大使說二「中國和其他國家獲得民主的惟一希望，就靠牠的人民能認識他們的權利與義務。」這眞是一語道破的金玉良言。我們對地方，對國家，在憲法上都有我們基本的自由和權利規定於第二章內，可是同時也有我們納稅和服兵役的義務。我們要做國家的主人，要做一市的主人，我們就得納國稅，納地方稅，不漏稅，不逃稅，這是有錢出錢的眞義，我們就得服兵役，及齡入伍，親爲責任，這是有力出力的眞義。至於國家法律，乃是維護社會秩序和公共利益的軌道，誰都應該遵守，更不庸說。我們旣以民主政治的公僕責望於政府官吏，我們尤須以民主政治的主人課督自己的責任，本會成立於訓政時期，已歷年半，今已進入憲政階段，不久依據憲法的市自治法規頒布以後，本市將有市議會的組織，故本會同仁不論來自區域，來自職業，來自黨派，更應身體力行，爲未來民選的市議會建立地方民主政治的良好基礎。我們極願學習民主先進國家議會的風格，儘可爲一案而爭論得面紅耳赤以求其表決之盡善，可是決不爲一案爭持之失敗而有所悻悻，專心致志，和衷共濟，惟大多數市民之福利是求，惟地方民主政治風氣之養成是務。此則尤望吾全市同胞隨時督敎匡正，不勝榮幸。」</p>
<p>出席大會之市府各首長，左起：趙祖康，趙曾珏，祝平，兪叔平，閔湘帆，田永謙，李熈謀，張維，張曉崧。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>市長希望參會指示切實方針　費樹聲促請實行決議案</h3>
<p>吳市長致詞略稱，此次市參議會第一屆第五次大會，有民靑兩黨參議員參加，會議更形擴大。本人於第一次會議時即謂希望「府會一家」，至今快二年來，已眞正做到了「府會一家」。市府對於貴會通過案件，均竭力想法執行，有未能實行者，實因事實上有困難。本人聽議長在會中致詞有五次，而以今日的言詞，最爲痛切感動。今年爲國家地方走向光明之一年，故亦爲最痛苦艱難之一年，大家都知道「天亮之前是最黑暗的時候，因此更感覺議長的指示重耍。市民最低的要求要辦什麼，希望參議會能指示一切實方針，使市府按此方針進行，由參議會天天監督，則即可使光明早日來臨。</p>
<p>參議員代表費樹聲致答詞，略謂，參議會四次大會結果，雖有得到外界贊許者，但亦有市民批評爲「衹爲自己講話。」我們對於市民批評應虛心接受，有檢討改進之必要。本會希望於市府者即（一）市府提出交議案時，應加以詳細硏究及老慮，免得在參議會中匆匆通過而實行後使市民呌苦連天。（一）一切問題均應提付參議會討論後再實行，勿以參議會爲實行民主政治之裝飾品。（三）希望過去本會已決議案件，儘先實行。</p>
<h3>因賭受辱糾眾報案　中央商場起槍聲　青年攤販受重創</h3>
<p>〔本務訊〕四川南路中央路口，昨日上午十時四十分許，發生一開槍傷人案。受傷者名方巧生，二十歲，合肥人，家住閘北新疆路南林里六一號，業販舊貨，在四川路之中央商塲內設攤，出售美軍剩餘物資，去年舊曆年底，方得暇至附近大統銀行後弄之美麗食品公司樓上，聚賭牌九，其時推莊者係一國府要員之警衛，名李達生，（廿六歲，粤籍，住滬西番禺路廿二號）雙方忽因賭博發生齟齬，當時方之同業羣起助方，致李受辱，怏快而去，遂懷恨在心，陰圖報復。後方探悉李之底蘊，已半月不敢設攤。昨晨十時餘，始復潛出設攤營生，李得訊後偕同友人三名，共乘汽車到來，兩着軍服，兩服便裝，至中央商塲（後，向方巧生大興問罪之師，一言不合，即由一人上前扭住方之衣襟，揮拳亂擊，其餘即上前圍毆，此時場內大亂，方之同業甚夥，均因對方軍人，不敢援助，方卒被毆受傷，呼喊救命，該軍人恐街警趕來，竟拔出手槍開放一響，命中方之右手背，貫穿手心，復自右腹穿至右股部，血流不止，應聲倒地，兇手乃一哄而散。其時有方之友人代抱不平，跟踪外出追趕，適有一美人懷希在旁目擊一切，亦奮勇協助，同時附近崗警及巡邏警長四六一六號，一一五六號，警士二一七七號，二二八二號，警官二三四二號多名加入圍捕，結果拘獲主犯李達生，帶入黄浦警局偵訊。受傷者舁送仁濟醫院診治，子彈已由醫師取出，聞傷勢沉重，性命堪虞。</p>
<p>被拘捕之主犯李達生（本報攝）</p>
<h3>預購三等車票即日開始輸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路局爲便利機關團體學校公敎人員乘坐火車起見，各次車頭二等客票，早經實行定購辦法，惟三等票，並未同時辦理。茲決定於即日起，凡各機關，學校之公敎人員，及正式團體之工作人員，均可憑公函或服務證，於出行前二日，向路局所設上海，南京，杭州等地之旅行服務所，預購三等車票。</p>
<h3>大會席上出現怪客　呼冤情願紛至沓來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日開會時，突來一年五十三歲之老人，名施承烈，吳興人，在舒同壽國藥號當夥計，自稱參議員，坐在議員席上參加開會，並且印了市參議員銜卡片。參會職員甚覺詫異，向他索取證明書，他拿出了一張當初選舉參議員的投票單，這老先生竟拿來當作當選設書了。據他表示，對於參會開會非常熱心，朋友們都說今天開會，推他出席，所以特來參加云云。職員知其被人愚弄，勸令離去。</p>
<p>物價高漲，參議員的車馬費亦隨之漲價，每人每天十四萬元。共計十天。</p>
<p>參議員席次第一號爲民社然參議員何品衡。</p>
<p>大會開幕，請願者又紛至，昨日有蘇北流亡難民及失業工人百餘人爲已製成三輪車輛請發郊區牌照再度請願，手執紙旗，排列大門對面，見到市長出來，大聲呼喊。又東大名路一三八號一小運輸公司老闆吳國才，於舊歷十二月廿九有楡林路便衣警察前來索開銷，因未付給被誣爲盜，將其拘去，並帶走其他店員等四人，至今毫無音訊，故其家屬男女老少二十餘人，由吳兄領導，持旗焚香到參議會跪地求伸寃。</p>
<p>市長報吿同濟學潮時，談他們有一標語說：「劊子手宣鐵吾，老狐狸吳國楨」。</p>
<p>參議員續有提案提出，總計迄今已有五十餘件。</p>
<h3>市長報告施政　提出兩大問題　全面配糧有賴協助監督　加強保甲組織勿信謠言</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長昨在參議會上報吿施政除有較詳細之畫面報吿分發各參議員外，並對市府九局分別提出較重要三點。作口頭說明。又特指出當前與全市有關之兩大問題，供參議員參考。此二大問題爲（一）生活問題，食米配給在三月內決定實行。美國方面已表示，須實施結果良好，始允再予援助，故此次辦理務必求其完善。因之希望每一市民應明際各人之義務與權利，同時要請市參議員，區長，區民代表共同協助，監督，使不發生流弊。（三）治安問題（亦即生存問題），根據一月二十九日同濟學潮，一月卅一日舞業搗毁社會局，二月二日申新工潮，一一月八日丁錫山登陸等事件，即可證明此係共匪之聯賞鬥爭，完全有計劃。他們以上海爲集中搗亂之大中心，以上詭計如成功，則試想上海將成何稱局面！幸賴軍警努力消滅大禍，則不得不歸功於宣司令。然我們可以想像得到，匪方之負責者，因事敗必受上峯譴責，則必將繼續搗亂，故本市方面務須注意二事：（一）加强保甲組織，（二）切勿聽信謠言。共匪宣傳種種謠言不擇手段，如此次本人被毆，謠說係被馬隊所推倒，全非事實。又說同濟學生因此案死了四百多人，豈非「天曉得」目前有所謂淸寒學生之種種聯誼會等提出無理要求，顯係別有用心。工人可謂千分之九百九十九是好人，切勿被少數不良份子煽動。</p>
<p>改善征兵　增加警察</p>
<p>關於各局施政：（一）民政，辦理兵役較重要。上海首次辦理兵役，三千名額全部徵足，亦可引以自慰，但缺點亦有如安家費及分發工作等未能完全滿意。今年舉辦兵役將更爲擴大，故決儘量改善辦法。本月二十九日將舉行本市兵役會議，其結果當可在大會中報吿</p>
<p>（二）警政，本市交通秩序，最難維持、但在最近數月內，交通警察執行職務成績相當進步，同時維持地方治安之精神，殊可佩服。今後地方加强武力實一大問題。上海警察共一萬二千人，此乃係前年所定，當時人口三百多萬，目前已近五百萬，而警察未有增加，尤其在當前環境之下，實有增强必要，故擬增加保安隊一一中隊，然經費一項不成問題。</p>
<p>物價多賑最難處理</p>
<p>（三）社會，社局爲處理年終獎金案件，辛苦達二個月之久，而物價高漲實使處事最難。今日上午八時半，本人尚與吳局長及糧商等硏討供米事宜。上海米價一九八萬，而無錫米却已達二一六萬，造成產地價格較此地反高情形，糧商自感到吃虧，市府要提高米價，則對市民有影響，要全部拋米，則來源成問題，此種苦衷，實「一言難盡」。三戶配米後，當可有很大幫助，而其他物品亦可陸續配給。此外關於冬令救濟工作，亦三月來最困難之事。流亡來滬難民三十餘萬，募款目標爲六百億，而現在實得僅二百多億。房屋義賣，市民有所誤會，應予解釋，（一）義賣房屋與大木橋平民房屋不同，均採上等工料，甲等目前市價已値二十四億，乙等亦値十六億。（二）開獎可保證絕對公允，將公開舉行。又第三庇　所設備較差，實因原係失業工人招待所，改設時間較短，此二週內已儘量改善。因庇寒所之設立，爲防盜竊减少，收到效果亦不小。</p>
<p>（四）敎育，（一）學費問題，所訂標準確係欲顧到家長及學校雙方利益，希望市民能明瞭。（二）辦理助學金，承各界熱心，已收到一百五十億元，然有所謂學生聯誼會等要求募獎學金七百六十億，又要求學費减低，敎職員待遇提高，此種言論全不負責。而且矛盾，必有陰謀。募集一百五十億已非易事，何處去募七百六十億。</p>
<p>裁員簡政實行困難</p>
<p>（五）財政，辦理情形，均遵照市參議會意思，然最近中央有命令來提高若千稅收，不得不請參會討論。而事實上，物價高漲與稅收之增加比率相差極大。市府裁員簡政，本人到任後即予實行，但目前情形困難，如警察人數即感不够。（六）工務，南市碼頭在一年內已完全改建，恒豐橋亦可於三月底開放。至疏濬蘇州河問題最大，舊歷年底時，食米二三天不到，焦慮異常，後派警察前往協助，發現新涇以上十五里地方，已成單行航道，船隻淤塞無法通行，此乃因八九年來敵僞政府未加疏濬之故。按現在物價，每年須疏　費八百億，須三年始可完成。市府擬以海關進口稅每年一千二百億中提出一部份以作此用，今年即可開始。（七）公用，本人到任時，本市發電量爲十萬瓩，現已增至二十餘萬瓩。市參議會能將聯合電廠一案通過，將來當更可改進。美援華貸款中亦已允將一千四百萬美元供該廠。節約用電目的在使生產用電可充裕而不致停頓，市府並不希望罰款，而盼節省，檢討結果，節約後可省七千瓩，雖數量不大，但如不限制，則浪費數量必將驚人，節約辦法到夏令時間或可取消或改變。公用事業加價實不得已，市府爲避免加價過高，特請各機關派員會同審査。如不加價，政府必須貼補，不貼補，惟有關門。</p>
<p>房租標準提請考慮</p>
<p>（八）地政，航空測量已全部完成，可供利用。淸理敵僞圈佔民地，應感謝參議會之努力，已由中央派員會同辦理。關於房租標準問題，本人認爲應該有一標準，因現在業主最感吃虧，房價低後，即無人願造屋，此項標準，亦須顧到各方面，本案請參議會精細考慮求一解決辦法。</p>
<p>（九）衛生，吳市長提到衛生，即贊許張局長爲一標準公務員，謂其到任時房屋亦無着，今市府設法始得一居處。張局長平時背債，本人亦知道，此次請假返鄉，旅費亦在籌措。其對於辦理衛生有極大貢獻。本市垃圾多處堆積，其原因亦爲蘇州河淤塞，船隻不易出口，致運輸遲緩。又今年防疫工作將特別注意，預料其嚴重性將甚於往年。</p>

<h3>從甘肅地層底下發掘文明遺物</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州十九日航訊〕本月十五至二十一日，國立甘肅科學敎育館正舉辦一個科學敎育展覽會，分理化，博物，鳥獸，工作動態照片四部門，在將近三千件的展出物品裏，從生物的起源一直到現代科學的最高成果，循序作淺近的說明，使人們明白甘肅的地層下，不但埋藏着多樣的資源——如石油·煤·石膏。芒硝等，而且還有着多末悠久的文化遺蹟——如四千年前的古陶，在洮河流域出土者。共他動植物的分佈，產量，電化敎育工具的構造，使用的說明，理化儀器的製造，實驗法，飛禽走獸的形能標本，使春節閑　進城來　的農友們，在半天的時間內，可以有一個明確的槪念，受到一種科學的薰陶，改正他們意識中傳說的訛誤，這是頗値得提倡的一種文化活動。　在博物室一列長檯上，陳列着十餘件脊椎動物的骨化石，種類有三趾馬，披毛犀，劍齒虎，龜等，慘白的色調，嶙峋的形態，現代人腦海裏陌生的名稱，使好些人在它前面發獃。——這就是該館硏究員王永焱君三年多的勞績，在遙遠的武都龍家溝所發掘而得的一小部份，這些骨化石，至少在五十萬年以前，便被埋入地底的。</p>
<p>從「人」到「龜」</p>
<p>在這十幾件化石裏，最引人喟嘆的便是那個龜殼化石，在兩年前，它是被作爲中國人類學上一顆燦爛的明星樣寳愛着的，那時大家都認爲是「原人」的頭骨化石，它已非正式的有了學各：「武都原人」（Paimitive　in　Wu-tu）卅五年七月杪，記者首次以虔敬的心情參觀這顆老始祖的頭骨，王永焱君循記者攝影之請，從嚴局的深櫃裏捧出它時，兩手簡直有些抖顫了。嗣後京滬的報紙上開始介紹這希奇的發現，宣傳部國際宣傳處且把其中的一篇譯爲英文，並刋佈一種小册子；在是年八月底，西北地質調查所的王敍五君首先揭破這個「原人之謎，」斷定其爲龜殼的化石，而引得南京地質調査所楊鍾健君寫一篇文章，發了不少的感慨</p>
<p>如今，這一個傳奇性的化石，已被標明是一個爬虫類的「龜」，雜在一些不重要的走獸羣裏。</p>
<p>錯誤亦有價值</p>
<p>自從「武都原人」變「龜」後，社曾人士寄予王永焱君的毁謗和嘲笑是很多的，有人甚至寫出「星期論文」在報端指責，王君的反響如何呢？——由這些地方，才可以看到一個眞正科學家的工作態度和信心——他對這些誹笑毫不理會，去年又到武都作第四次的發掘，那個龍家溝的化石層，因爲他看到，也只有他自己相信那地方有着不可勝計的喃乳動物骨化石。其價値雖不能稱雄世界，至少在國內是稀有的。</p>
<p>去年初冬的一個傍晚，記者到甘肅科學敎育館採訪，在王永焱君的工作室裘會到了他，他正在佝僂着身軀搞他那一大堆破骨頭，他瞥見記者時，馬上直起身來，忘記了寒喧，開始滔滔不絕的說起他那些化石來，「喏，羚羊的腿，犀牛的下顎，鬣狗的脊椎，馴鹿的角，象的牙，狒狒的下顎……」—還是那一老套，不過數量比前年（卅五年）多得多了，當記者問他一共有多少件時？他伸出四個指頭來「四千件！總重量三噸半。」</p>
<p>「你是以多取勝的，」記者笑着說。</p>
<p>「不是。」他斬鐵截釘的：「龍家溝眞多，於其找得一鱗半爪來硏究，再送給權威學家去鑑定，在時間，金錢各方面來說，是很不會算的，所以不如大量的發掘出來，一塊兒硏究，比較，參證，要省事而正確得多。」</p>
<p>我們談起「武都原人」的事，他嚴肅的說：「我並不因人家批評我錯誤而氣餒，我更不怕人家的訕笑，我相信學術界的人士，肚會上有識之士，是不會如此的，我吿訴你：」他簡直把我當他的學生，「英國某科學考察團在南菲工作時，誤將象之關節骨認爲原人之頭骨，北京人之解剖研究者步達生（Davison　Black），曾將山東發現的鹿大腿骨認爲猿人之腿骨，即以名人類學者奧斯本（Osborn），曾將美洲發現一牛之乳牙，也誤爲美人祖先之遺齒，凡此一切，非但不爲世界任何一個學者，專家所誹笑，還成了科學史上很重要的一階段，——你知道，一本科學史，就是一部科學錯誤史，科學的硏究在求其眞理，其過程中的任何錯誤，皆有助於眞理的發現，皆有其錯誤的價値，因爲，經過種種的錯誤後，才能得到不錯誤的眞理，一個科學研究者，並不因其錯誤而恐惹人笑，同時，稍有科學常識的，也絕不因其錯誤而哂笑之，况且『武都原人』正在開始研究，正式報吿迄未發表…」</p>
<p>骨化石的寶藏</p>
<p>在參觀了科學敎育展覽之後，記者專訪王永焱君，問他陳列的骨化石，何以只有二百七十分之一，那些較珍貴的東西爲什麽不擺出來，王君說；「一來地方小，二來這是供給一般人看的，只要使一般人明白甘肅的地層下有着這末些東西罷了。」記者要求他一述發現的經過，他說，「正如裴文中先生說的，在這戰亂頻仍的日月裏，還有誰去注意這些與實際生活甚少關聯的地質考古工作？如果貴報眞尊重學術，需要這種材料時，我倒有一篇論文節要，就交給你發表出來吧」？他在抽屜內翻出一張紙頭來交給記者，並補充說：「這是我在去年中國地質學會蘭州分會年會上宣讀過　，西北演壇（按：該刊將在一個月後出版）的編者先生已搜集了預備輯印專輯將來版權發生問題，我可不管。」末一句是開玩笑的話，我開始默讀他這篇有關武都骨化石的第一篇論文節要：</p>
<p>武都推動物化石層之發現（節要）</p>
<p>民國三十四年，在甘肅南部工作時，於武都縣城北九十華里之能家溝生地坡地方，發現狗，羊，犀，鹿，等哺乳類化石十餘塊。三十五年曾得敎育部之經費補助，在生地坡發掘兩次，共費時三月有餘。三十六年春復得教育部之補助，在原地又工作兩個月之發掘，前後共得化石四千餘件，此等化石業已開始修理，詳確之鑑定，尙待修理完竣之後。</p>
<p>化石產地附近之地層，由老而新如次：（一）志留紀（Silurian　Period）—高家村東露出之藍灰色石灰岩，黑色千枚岩，夾有劣質煤層；（二）泥盆紀（DevonianPeriod）—土焦山之含有Atrtpa薄曆藍灰色石灰岩。（三）石炭紀（Carboniferous　Period）—灰黑，灰黄龍石炭岩，在野牛寺附近露出甚廣。。（四）疊紀（Permian　Period）—下部　灰白色厚層茅口石灰岩，上　石灰礫岩，黄砂岩，黑頁岩，與煤層相混之龍家溝煤系，煤系之上復有灰白色厚層石灰岩，可能係茅口石灰岩逆掩於煤系之上。在生地坡地方，茅口廠灰岩之上，覆有甚厚紅層，表面風蝕成土，其餘附近二三十華里內，無剖面可資參考，僅在化石發捆坑之西壁，掘出南北長五公尺八，深二公尺之剖面一段，傾斜爲北向二十度，去向北徧西二十五度，地層由下而上：A，淡紅稍帶黄色之密緻粘土層，厚一公尺；B，較A稍紅流鬆粘土層，厚五公寸；C，與A同，厚八公寸；D與B同，厚一公尺，E，稍帶灰白色堅硬砂質粘土層厚四公寸；F與B同，厚五公寸；G與E同，厚四公寸；H與B同，厚一公尺以上。其中富含化石層爲B，C，D，更在此小小剖面上，有小型逆斷層五個。</p>
<p>因化石尙未修理完竣，其中究竟含有何種動物，目下不得全知，不過由已修出者觀察之，武都脊推動物化石層，至少包括以下各種動物：甲，食肉類（Carnivora）者計有：豹（Felidae豺（Hgaena）劍齒虎（Machairodus）太（Canidae）熊（Ursedae）等；乙，奇蹄類（Perissodactyla）者計有：額鼻角犀（Dicerorhinus）無角犀（Chilotheriuns）中國巨齒犀（Sinotherium）三趾馬（Hipparionn）三門馬（Equus　Sameniensis）等；丙，偶蹄類（Artiodadlyla）者計有：猪（Susidae）羚羊（Antelope）等；爬虫類（Reptilia）者有龜（Emydida　）等，靈掌類（Primate）者計有狒狒（Gorilla）</p>
<p>除上述化石外，近年筆者又在西和縣南鄉及武都縣北鄉獲得水牛，劍齒象，犀，鹿，羊等化石十餘件。」</p>
<p>「啊，豐富的骨化石寳藏！」當記者讀完王君這篇論文節要，不禁發出輕輕的歡呼。</p>
<p>展開未來活動</p>
<p>接着，記者請敎王永焱君，未來的計劃如何？他說：「現在已與中央地質調査所新生代硏究室楊鍾健先生商定硏究的辦法，條件是這樣的：由我把修理好的骨化石，選有代表性的數十件運到南京，由楊先生鑑定，按通例，運往的運費由甘肅科學敎育館負担，運回的運費由中央地質調査所負担。出版權歸中國地質學會編列爲「古生物誌」之一，發表時由楊先生與我共同署名。至於今年赴南京硏究和第五次去武都繼續發掘的費用，已由科學敎育館呈請敎育部撥給四億元，呈文是今年元月份賚部的，因爲敎育費預算的核定問題，到現在還未撥到，不過以我過去數次請求補助，都得到朱部長的特准，朱部長是地質界的老前輩，很體念這種工作的重要，這一次大槪也不會有問題。」</p>
<p>他又吿訴記者，去年七八月間，裴文中先生赴洮河流域作考古工作時，他也隨往共同工作過一個時期，在他與裴氏相處的日子裏，他體會到裴先生是很虛心的學者。關於他在武都的發掘情形，我國古生物學權威楊鍾健氏在一本美國脊椎動物學會會刋上，也提及武都骨化石的發現。</p>
<p>我們談起裴氏正在組織的「西北考古工作隊」，王君說據他私人得到的消息，現在已因經費無着而無下文，不過，裴文中先生在今年暑假中，一定會再來甘肅，繼續工作的。</p>
<p>記王永焱其人</p>
<p>末了，記者將介紹這一位西北的靑年科學家王永焱君，王君蘭州市人，今年只有卅五歲，早年習航空飛行，因病（色盲）東渡日本九州，入民治工大專攻地質，兼及生物考古；抗戰後返國，即爲鄉梓服務，廿七年至卅年，任甘肅建設廳工程師，從事甘肅省的經濟地質調査硏究，三十年後，入國立甘肅科學敎育館自然科學硏究員，並兼推廣部主任，現仍任斯職。</p>
<p>在這悠長的十年中，前三年離不了「等因；奉此。」卅年才開始了他地質旅行的工作，是年調査甘肅東南部及陝西南部的地質，著有「甘肅東南部之地質與礦產」；卅一年調査河西地質，著有「河西地質旅行記」；卅二年調査甘肅東北部及寗夏地質，著有「　子峽煤田地質」，「寗夏汝箕溝磠砂礦調査報吿」；卅三年調査隴東的地質，著有「隴東地質之初步硏究」；卅四年調查甘肅南部的地質，著有「西固鐵礦誌」，接着在武都發現了脊椎動物化石層，其餘三年多的時間都化費在化石的發掘，整理與研究中。</p>
<p>他除了在野外作這些本身的地質調查工作之外，還注意到甘肅富源的蘊藏，也寫過兩本書，其一是「西北食鹽」，其一是「甘肅資源錄」。這些著作，爲繼起工作者不可或缺的參考資料。</p>
<p>記者不願意過份譽揚這一個埋頭實幹的靑年科學工作者，只覺得他是可敬佩的，他是虔誠的基督敎徒，不嗜烟酒，永遠那末精力充沛的工作着，我們可以想像到，在西北的高原曠野上，在人跡罕到的深山裏，在烈日下，在暴風中，連雨雪的驟降也難以找到一個蔽身的處所——除非是山巖下或窰洞裏——的環境裏，他揹起行囊，帶着儀器，踽踽的獨行，細心的觀察，非身歷其境，是不知道其中的甘苦的。</p>

<h3>臺大中國文學系主任許壽裳血案之謎</h3>
<p>〔本報台北廿三日航訊〕台大中國文學系主任許壽裳（季茀）十九日晨三時許突遭人暗殺的消息，已由記者專電判出，茲再將經過情形記述如次：</p>
<p>許壽裳是六十六歲的名學者，他是陳儀，周樹人的同鄉，留日老前輩。台灣光復爲陳長官羅致來台，任省編譯館長，省府改制後，該館被裁撤，即就任台大中國文學系主任，他不僅是一個刻苦的學者，並且是一位慈祥淳厚的靑年優良導師。這兩年來，他致力於台灣文史的著述，更努力發掘敦煌的遺蹟，他仍過着最淸苦的文筆生涯。</p>
<p>在他的日記裏，從一月二十五日到二月十六日間，接連發生了兩件事，其一是在校薪水的被偸，其二是寓所被盜，老人生前相信命運，結果却逃不了命運的播弄，第三次他被人殺死了。被殺的情形太慘，兇手自低牆越入，頸部中四五刀，頰邊中一刀，蓆子上有一堆血，室內凌亂不堪，大約在三時許。直到天明六時半，住在另一個房間裘的長女世瑋（台大農院二年級生），催醒兩個孩子似的下女，看一下怎會遲起的主人，結果發現昨晚活着的老人，仍横躺在竹床上，頸部血肉模糊，血筋未斷，這樣才慌忙由長女急吿同學後報警，由軍憲警及法院派員至現場査檢，記者和友人們也紛紛趕到唁慰。</p>

<p>因此，許多人都感覺着一個廿八歲河北人的助敎周家風，似乎有着相當的嫌疑，但是在出事後的早晨，他還去找尋他的老師世瑛（死者之長子，現任師範學院副敎授另居），警務處副處長劉戈靑的假想却又是帶有否定成份的。他說：假使是一個賊，以前偸過他的東西，再來偸（兇手似故佈疑陣，臨走時，還偸去了一隻皮箱，內係不値錢的夏季衣服），那又何用殺死他？而照兇器是一把柴刀和頸部同一部位傷痕五六刀來看，一定又不是英俊的胆大的慣徒。但就離床較遠有血跡來看，死者一定反抗過的，但反抗爲什麽沒有聲音，最後掙扎的聲音不能驚醒女兒和下女？雖然下女年紀很輕，或許不懂事。</p>
<p>迨二十三日晚十時，警務處以案情已明，乃發表殺死許壽裳之兇手，係前編譯館工友高萬俥，二十二歲，渠被辭退後，迭犯竊偸贓物。血衣在桃園搜務獲，警處以三天半功夫破案，可謂相當迅捷了。</p>
<p>許氏屍體經台大醫院化裝後，已於二十日下午三時在寓所大殮，台大和師院以及省府各長官，都合着淚爲死者料理後事。死者所遺留的現鈔，衹台幣一千元。（本報特派員江暮雲）</p>
<p>一月廿五日　鈔是「敦煌研究」稿。</p>
<p>一月廿九日　得景宋信，謂已寄魯迅傳一册。</p>
<p>二月六日　上午至校，囑周家風去領薪（加成數補發）二萬四千餘元，我因正在校稿，先置皮篋旁，及校畢將如厠小便，即將款暫擱，抽斗而下樓去，及回室洗手，家風亦入，我檢袖斗，此款已失，爲時僅兩分鐘，可駭怪。後由筱梅命校警査視，周警長對於周家風極注意，問極詳。我均替家風回護。</p>
<p>二月七日　至校主持中文會議，得家風信，知昨日下午校警喚他至校盤問，此事於他面子不好看，但校警爲職責在，不能不從各方面檢査，且家風邇來不檢，與其女工姦私生子，知之者甚多，人因將疑其家庭負祖太重也。</p>
<p>二月十三日　夜九時半入睡。十時後晨三時前，竊賊入室盜去富士牌新男車一輛，新男皮鞋一雙，盜係由院入，即開玄關門，晨六時始發現被竊，即托陳耀强報警，經派員來查一週。</p>
<p>二月十四日　配門鎖窗，所謂賊出關門也。</p>
<p>二月十六日　信周家風，准其辭職。</p>

<h3>敎部昨發布　整頓學風令</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕敎部　於年來學風不振，學潮迭起，不良份子乘機煽動，爲矯正頹風，安定學校，俾純正靑年，得有保障，安心向學，廿三日發佈整頓學風通令如次：「近年以來，學風不振，復員之後，益起浮囂。各校風潮迭起，率由不良份子乘機　惑，一般靑年受其誘脅，或則罷課遊行，或則恃衆要挾。凡所請求，不惟逾越理智，溢出範圍，抑且自高身份，形同交涉，稍一不遂，侮辱隨之。</p>
<p>學府尊嚴　掃地貽盡</p>
<p>卅五年南京臨時大學補習班學生反對考試，聚衆滋事，毆傷班主任。上年南京各校學生集體請願，呌囂累日，盤據公署，妨害公務。交通，英士兩大學學生，結隊來京，羣集車站，刧奪機車，阻斷交通。平津滬穗各地一部分學生，復於五月廿日至六月二日間醞釀全國性罷課罷市罷工之運動。最近同濟大學學生又甘受奸人利用，不聽市長敎誨，罷課輟業，擾亂秩序，毆辱市長，幾至發生流血慘劇。而大學中且有縱火破壞情事。學府尊嚴，掃地殆盡，社會爲之疾首！輿論同深憤慨！</p>
<p>職司敎育　義難坐視</p>
<p>本部職司敎育，義難坐視，惟以歷次主動者僅爲少數學生，又深悉幕後之策動指使，均爲共匪及其工具之所爲，大多數在學靑年均出於　迫被動，實未忍不分皂白，遽予嚴繩。然國家興學說敎，所以作育人才，學生入校就學，所以儲養知能。我國抗戰八年，元氣凋殘，勝利之後，共匪作亂，農工生產備遭破壞，中央財政益見艱困。本部以百年大計，首在樹人，對於恢復校舍，擴充設備，雖限於財力，未能盡如預期，而重視學生課業，充實學校師資，體恤貧寒學子，獎掖優良學生，則多方籌劃，無時不盡其最大之努力。</p>
<p>國家愛護　社會培植</p>
<p>抗戰期內，對轉入後方之學生，旣分發人學，給予公費；勝利以來，對於收復區之學生，亦察其程度，從寬檢審，使有求學升學之機會，一面並增設學校，收容靑年，凡此鉅額經費之支出，罔非取給於辛勤勞苦之人民。今我一般在學靑年，乃　國家之愛護與社會之培植於不顧，犧牲課業，一　十寒，軌外行動，變本加厲，視學校爲傳舍，而據以荒嬉，視師長若路人，而罔知愛敬。桀黠者，以發動風潮爲快意；純樸者，又甘受少數之刧持，馴致自屬於特殊之階級，自外於國家之法紀，認識錯誤，言動乖張，遂使共匪分子得以鼓動利用，　張爲幻，或指使甲校學生干涉乙校之自由，或先令一地發動而嗾各地以響應，長此以往，將使國家愛惜靑年之苦心轉以造成戕賊靑年之後果。本部調査所得，確知共匪爪牙，不惜以全國敎育爲犧牲。</p>
<p>痛切告誡　猛省前天</p>
<p>茲當假期屆滿，特用痛切告誡，喚起我全國各校學生之自覺，務各自愛自勉，尊重法紀，恪守校規，努力學業，補旣往之蹉跎，求學問之進步。倘仍不知憬悟，荒廢功課，蔑視校規，破壞法紀，逾越軌範，則害羣之馬必予淸除，從盤　處，決無姑息，本部　保偉激育秩序，對整頓學風，早具決心，必要時不惜將不堪聲頓之學校予以解散或停辦，願我全國青年學生，猛省前失，交懲互勉，重造良好之風紀，無負國家之　育，切切此令！</p>

<h3>市當局放寬食米限價　拋售辦法同時停止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因最近本地價格與產區懸殊，致到貨稀少，塲內交易因限價關係無形停頓，此外則黑市高漲。南北米市塲管理委員會委員査　之，顧益生，徐頌仁，胡文安，蔡聲明，印福祥，楊久慈等七人，於昨晨八時半赴市府晋謁吳市長，申述產她米價高漲，本市糧商無法誘導食米來滬，請求市長設法解決困難。時社會局長吳閒先，民食調配會常委任顯羣，糧食部參事葉實夫，社局糧食科長吉明齋均在座。經會商結果，並經吳市長以長途電話請示行政院張院長及與糧部兪部長交換意見後，決定取消本市前定市塲交易一百九十五萬及門售一百九十八萬之限價，放寬至市塲交易不得超過二百二十五萬元，門售以加合法利潤百分之六計算，約二百四十萬元。政府並自即日起停止在市塲拋米。</p>
<h3>米店納胃頗濃</h3>
<p>昨米市因天氣轉晴及放寬限價關係，到貨較多。北市登記一六二八石，南市四〇一一右。白粳南市做二二〇萬，北市二二五萬。薄稻南市做二一八萬，北市二二〇萬。早稻南市做二一三萬，北市二一六萬。碾秈南市二〇五萬，北市二一二萬。市塲內已恢復蓬勃之氣象，塲外交易無形鎖滅，米店納胃頗濃。去化活絡。</p>
<p>食油初市升十餘萬，後節節高挺，竟又見瘋狂之漲勢。由於無錫價格高於申市，致貨主脫意甚淡。開市即見做高，大有豆油初曾開五百〇五萬，後因內地帮及本街納胃殊暢，價格扶搖直上，最後火有豆油回龍貨高至五百二十八萬元，較上週六狂升三十八萬元之鉅。其他廠豆油於中市開出，價大都在五百十餘萬。後市亦須五百二十八萬，但未有交易。吉桶生油以五百八十萬元成交，上升二十五萬。小簍生油開五百四十萬，生熟菜油各漲三十餘萬，小車蔴油重出六百萬關外，豆餅升二三萬元。</p>
<p>麺粉因無錫價格高於申價甚鉅，且小麥價再升至一百四十五萬，貨主堅執不售，更聞米價之上漲，進戶急起納取，漲勢頗爲熾烈。老車粉初開即爲一百十五萬元，繼再升至一百十六萬元，較上週收市價猛漲十五萬元之鉅。兵船粉至高達一百十四萬元。麩皮投機交易頗多，價在買勢　飛升十萬元。大包麩皮由六十九萬開盤，直跳至七十七萬。</p>
<p>雜糧一致上揚，黃豆初開尚平，中途客帮染指，頓起升騰，後聞油價狂漲，漲勢更盛。漢口乍豆收盤一百四十五萬元，計挺十萬元。平湖杜豆先開甚呆，後市亦挺。揀靑高三四萬元。糙米靑島帮納取不倦，上漲五萬。紅糧開一百三十五萬，菉豆昂五萬。芝蔴緩升，漢口白蔴三百十萬，計挺五六萬元。生仁高貨較定，中次貨挺升十五至二十萬。</p>

<h3>茶市交稀價堅</h3>
<p>內銷茶買戶，鋻於本街與蘇錫一帶走銷旺盛，加以銀根日趨鬆弛，活動之意，變本加厲。供售者則受貨稀關係，吐售遂殊寥寥，是以交易雖狄，價格漲風一時難以遏止。至於外銷花色，授受依然平庸，惟形勢則一致跟踵向榮。</p>
<h3>省債申請換償　息金準予補付</h3>
<p>但以卅六年底以前申請爲限</p>

<h3>環境助長買氣　華股頻創高價</h3>
<p>華股昨環境繼續助長買氣，圈外刺激更重，中途極度俏利，新價頻創。大戶鄭某葉某乘高出籠，回風一起，驟吿變色，臨收稍怯。</p>
<p>晨開即受種種環境助買消息而見高，永紗以九〇〇元及儿一〇元登塲。開後迭創高價，三六號七六號進遞交，二〇六號一一七號三號進即交，升至九二四元及九二八元。一五七號一八〇號二二〇號脫手即交，四五號出遞交，塲外息價開高至二角二分半及二角七，銀根已露緊勢，低至九一〇元及九一五元。無奈業外之刺激紛來助買，不一而足，人心仍好，漲到儿三七元及九四三元。雖一度退至九三〇元及九三七元，但轉瞬即漲達九四四元及九四九元高價。二〇六號趁高出即交，二二號出遞交，午收爲九三八元及九四四元。熟股之買氣漸漸普及，小股同吿帶上，較上週六計麗安漲一成弱，永紗　北信和華　新光景福中法新華內衣永公火柴中絲美亞大通統益榮豐國貨各漲半成，中紡平，餘均微升。遞交股美亞升一成，餘均漲半成。</p>
<p>後市工貸消息有所露佈，上塲仍俏，見九六〇元及九六三元新高峯。有人力售，乃跌至九二〇元及九二二元。國行交換實差進僅三千餘億，回升至九三五元左右。塲外仍有大戶斬多，塲內有一五七號一一六號三六號六九號二二號再加壓力，收市屈居九一八元及　二五元。結果較前收計即交股大通漲停，恒豐升半成，景福平，由紡微升，永紗美西新光勤興及餘者均微跌。遞奪　計美亞永紗新光景福　　勤興均微挫。塲外各未上市股票頗為　利，咸吿上漲。</p>
<h3>經紀人保證金決定分別照加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：財經　部前令本市證交着各經紀人，將原有身份保證金五千萬元，於本年二月廿六日前，調整至一億五千萬元。證交迄未正式公吿，惟聞兩部對經紀人原繳三千萬元美金債券部份，准予按中央銀行本年二月一日外匯掛牌價，比例提升，以對折繳存。原有現金二千萬元部份，則增加至現金六千萬元云</p>
<h3>統債盤低　外股激漲</h3>
<p>公債高後步回，統丙晨開八萬四，即騙高盤。低至七萬八，而後稍平。五五二室五〇三室買進，五〇〇室五五室賣出，較上週六計甲乙戊跌二千元，丙丁挫落三千元，成交約一百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨港電及環境之助買，氣息加濃，漲勢炙手　然。怡紗自九二萬開後，迫一百萬新高峯，而後略起回風。證劵帮先進後出，洋行帮有納，結果上週六除電話　業航業所升不多外，怡紗英聯會德豐紙版怡　及橡皮股各漲一成，業廣好起成半。</p>
<h3>銀錢業昨改定二月份存欠息</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀錢業二月份存欠息，昨起更動如次：同業存款一元一角（照舊），欠款六元五角（减五角）。同業拆放及公庫證拆放四元五角（减五角）。</p>
<h3>本街客帮紛起搜購　紗價直線上升　棉紗議價又經紗管會提高</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因外埠紗價飛揚，客帮紛起搜購，本街亦乘機有進，並以頭寸甚鬆，買戶奇暢，市勢益形鋒铓，喊價直綿上升。四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即衝出九千萬大關，高至九千二百萬元有人買進，嗣後雖紡建公司見高再度懸牌供售，奈以人心振作，收吸不衰，行情繼續上升。四十二支藍鳳紗高價九千四百萬元收盤，較之週六，續漲九百五十萬元。四十支及卅二支各紗，漲勢更烈，均狂騰一千餘萬元。其他各支粗細紗，亦步昻達一一一成有餘。</p>
<p>棉布猛漲</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以紗價奔騰不已，人心堅俏逾恒，並以銀根仍吿鬆馳，外埠廣東漢口及北帮，去化大見開展，喊價再吿猛挺。惟染廠以實銷並不樂觀，吸胃閑散，本街門莊號家亦鮮動靜，中途同業有獲利吒售，但行情在人心激昻之下，低後即高。結果十二磅龍頭五福等各檔細布，比週六均又狂漲自十四萬五千至廿二三萬。振中漲卅萬之鉅，此外嗶嘰直貢細斜漂布及色布士林等，亦均一致飛黄騰達。</p>

<h3>呢羢春銷發動</h3>
<p>昨星期一，呢羢茶會市塲上，趨勢較上週爲活躍，蓋春銷蠕動，本街及客帮互有問津添辦，標準方面，因此悉多超過紅盤之上。花呢宣維淡黄華達呢，春大衣料海列司等，又見堅俏。廠盤開出增高，突爲主要關係。所有交易，進出款子，均係本月底支票居多。</p>
<h3>抑止花紗漲風　紗管會禁止南運　並向同地方政府發動檢查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會以近日滬市棉紗棉布價格，狂漲不已，雖經設法抑制，漲風仍未平息。原因雖多，而撤銷紗布南運限制後，使紗布南運數量過多，與市內投機份子之作祟，實爲主要原因。茲爲採取有效措施起見，關於紗布南運，自本月廿四日起，暫行停止。已由該會公吿週知，幷函知江海關辦理。同時令中紡公司大量拋售棉紗，幷會同地方政府，發動檢査倉庫及紗號，嚴切取締投機囤積份子，一經査出，嚴予懲處云。</p>
<p>又訊：近日棉花棉紗狂漲，據棉業界權威人士對棉花上漲之不合理，發表談話稱：去年美國產棉增加三百萬包，即一千二百餘萬担，較一九四六年增產在百分之三十以上，我國產棉亦增加二百萬　。印度產棉並無增减，全世界產棉量均較往年爲多。</p>
<p>我國產棉，雖因交通不便，影　運輸，但產棉主要區城如沙市·漢口。及洞庭湖畔，交通運輸並無困難，目前中紡及農行，代購棉花，成績甚好。舊歷新年元宵以前，往年均停收購，今年則反加　　　，故各地收購數量，均甚可觀。</p>
<p>美國援華貸款五億　　萬元內，規定以一億七千萬配購美棉，依現價購三百萬擔，將來全部輸入，我國棉花供應必能有盈無虧，是以棉價實無上漲之理由。又昨日棉紗劇漲，二十支雙馬牌棉紗，竟達六千二百萬元以上，亦已超過實際生產成本，主管方而並已在積極籌擬有效對策云。</p>

<h3>大學「格物」「致知」朱子補傳解</h3>
<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>朱子著大學章句，分經分傳，以經文「格物致知」無傳，因取程子之意而補之曰：「所謂致知在格物者，言欲致吾之知，在即物而窮其理也。蓋人心之靈莫不有知，而天下之物莫不有理；惟於理有未窮，故其知有不盡也。是以大學始敎，必使學者即凡天下之物莫不因其已知之理而益窮之，以求至乎其極；至於用力之久，而一旦豁然貫通焉，則衆物之表裏精粗無不到，而吾心之全體大用無不明矣。此謂格物，此謂知之至也。」</p>
<p>嘗謂朱子補傳不及數百言，顧於知識之形成，及其主觀客觀之條件，皆已具其端倪，實與近代西哲之知識論相發明，而「即物窮理」之論尤與科學精神相　合，惜乎後儒之識淺，而不能竟其緒也。不揣謭陋，爲解朱子之意，以質學者。</p>
<p>「人心之靈莫不有知」，其「知」有可說焉：官接物而爲感，感達於心而成覺成知。顧此知覺之能常存於心，應感而成知成覺。墨經曰：「知，材。知也者，所以知也；而不必知。若明。」「知，材」云者，所以爲知之本能也；不與物接，則知之材無所施其用，而所以爲知者未必有知，故曰「不必知。」如目雖有明，苟不視物，猶無以爲見也。吾心旣有所以爲知之材矣，至若其所知者，莫非事物之理，蓋事物之接於我心，捨理無他途焉；故欲致吾心之知，亦唯即物而窮其理，理有未窮，則其知有不盡也。且夫知之材之施於事物，撮其理而爲知也，又有其所操之具，不假外求，而爲吾心所固有者，若名學之思律（Laws　of　Thonght），若形學之定理（Axioms），……是已。今夫所謂「即凡天下之物，因其所已知之理而益窮之」者，所已知之理，其始也蓋卽吾心所固有，而不假於外求者，以此爲之基，因之以求其所未知，繼而所未知者轉而爲所已知，更因之而益窮其所未知，寖假而有以至乎其極。所謂「一旦豁然貫通」者，窮理旣衆，乃收會通之效；而其所會通者輒成共理公例，其用乃在據往知來，執因求果，凡此皆名學內箍與外箍（Induction　and　Deduction）之功：方吾心之始用其所固有之知於事物也，是爲外箝之事；繼而即物而窮其理，以至於豁然貫通，內箍之事也；終而執其貫通所得之共理公例，以御蕃變，逆未然也，則又外箝之功。宜乎「衆物之表　精粗無不到，而吾心之全體大用無不明」也。</p>
<h3>曼漢論實用主義</h3>
<p>— 陳卓如譯</p>
<p>我以爲實用主義之積極意義，爲將思想與行動間的抽象藩籬撤消。從某一意義言，此爲走向新計劃時代的新式思想——相依相成的思想——的重要步驟。實用主義體會到每一個思想，本質上是行動的有機的一部分，故而反對某些哲學家所主張的純粹理論是與實際行動沒有關係的舊見解。除了一個鎖在寺院中的人外，思想不應視爲冥想，即思想不應僅爲的是思想而不爲生活或行動的工具。在現實的人生中，沒有思想不與行動發生直接關聯的。忽視或否認思想與行動的該項一致性，便是否認思想在本質上爲環境所決定。從科學的觀點看來，重申行動的創造性是有益無損的，要曉得衹有一種新行動才有一種新思想。這種精神在敎育上已經結了果實，因爲我們可以看見現在敎育不靠抽象的說敎，而靠一種新的敎育技術。這種方法就在安排環境使兒童能實行他們所學的原則。純恃規勸與斥　已被遺棄不用了</p>
<p>實用主義的優點在打破使思想脫離行動的抽象作用。但實用主義在現形式下亦有其缺點。這就是它將行動的範圍限得太窄。我們不能將行動局限於日常生活的瑣屑動作中，我們也不能集中注意於個人及其切身的利害的一個小圈子。這種狹義的解釋，使思想界限於碰機會的發明的階段中。在這種局面中，大多數仍祗是一些無意識的適應行爲——一切爲的是眼前的生活。在這一階段時，思想衹是一個不甚重要的一一等角色，因爲它沒有創造能力。思想衹在偶然的，零碎的靈感中間塡隙縫，思想的本事便不過爲　試中偶然得來的發現的意義。思想要能投射到將來，先在意象中將具體的事物析成爲抽象的單元，然後重新綜合以期達到預期的“標，這種思想才和眼前的偶然發現有別，這便是有意的發明了。總而言之，這一階段證明抽象的思考起源於一種比偶然發現更高一級的活動——即發明思想的歷史階段。</p>
<p>當思想從無意的發現階段過渡到有意的發明階段，思想與行動間的聯系便不能直接地把握了。這便是有些唯心論的哲學家之所以認爲思想與實際需要沒有關係的原因。在這一階段中，我們可以說觀念產生在行動之前，而且可以指揮行動。典型的說法是：在外界尙沒有房子時，房子的觀念早存在於那建築師的腦子中間了。</p>
<p>我們一如此看思想，則很容易誤解思想是不依存於經驗的。在有意的發明階段，我們不能否認思想的某些抽象性，正如我們也不能完全承認思想之與具體活動之背景無關一樣。在這一階段的思想固然可以超軼眼前的需要，但它到底仍不是無所爲而爲的絕對的東西。</p>
<p>難題的解答在乎認識有意發明的思想，其背景不完全限於個人的活動範圍。因此，我們可以說思想是絕對的，絕對的指與個人活動無甚關係的意思。但是有意的發明思想仍與廣義，行動有關。假若我們注意在整個歷史集團中，思想與行動如何有綜錯交互的關係，我們對於這一點便該了然。所以在這一階段中的思想，其實用性便不能專從個人的行動中看出來，但如果我們注意那個人所屬的集團的行動，思想的實用性便顯然了。就是從無意的發現到有意的發明也不能完全歸功於個人的成就，而當歸功於社會的整個適應，從原始的不大分工的生產形式（例如原始的採集與　獵時代）到更繁複的分工形式。因爲工作與社會機能分工的進步，從前視爲整例的制度或東西現在便變成很零碎的，因爲每一個人都衹從集團工作中他的一部分來看。抽象不必爲外物所決定，而是爲思想者的活動性質所決定，特別是被個人所屬　集團之組織所決定。因此思想便指「集團的思想」。活動範圍愈廣，分工愈細，同樣一件事而可以從不同方面來看的人數越多，則要求講淸一件事，社會化的人便不得不避免採用個別不同的制度與歷程的看法，不得不發明一種全社會皆能採用的抽象看法。因此抽象的形態可能極多，正如一個社會集體解決問題的方法一般多。因此工作與社會機能的分工使一個社團中產生比一個人所能單獨需要的更多的觀點，因此他便可以學習比他實際需要更多的東西。社會藉語言與槪念積蓄了一大堆的經騐與抽象，與在歷史中所曾通行的辦法之多少成比例。這便可以解釋爲什麽一個人對着他面前一大堆可以利用的抽象發獃便要覺得這些思想的範疇與歷程是先天的；方法論地言，這便等於相信他的槪念與知覺是從另一個世界得來。實際講來，現有的觀念（字彙亦然）總不能超出他所在的社會的範圍。因此，那以爲在發明階段中的思想完全不與行動有關的幻覺是由於一個高度階層化而分工又十分複雜的社會中，集體的觀點已經不能看出來了的緣故。他個人之所以能保持他理智的超然感，便由於他不能看見他個人的經騐如何與社會的經騐有關。在有意發明的階段中，實用主義的解釋仍可以用於全社會，但不能用於個人——至少是不能如此直接解釋。</p>
<h3>戰時美國哲人的著述</h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>這一次的大戰，美國哲人相當活動，作者已在前一文裏報吿過（本刊第十期）。現在要報吿的是，戰時美國哲人的著述。在戰時美國哲人還是一樣努力寫作。首先從美國哲人所出版的各種哲學定期刋物而論，在戰時不惟沒有停頓，而且增加起來，較戰前更爲熱鬧。歷史較久的哲學什誌。如「哲學評論」（Philssophical　Review）只略爲减少了一些篇幅，照常出版。至「哲學半月刊」（Journalof　Philosophy）則仍維持每年七百三十頁的篇幅，繼續出版。他如「倫理學」（Ethico），「科學的哲學」（Philosophy　of　Science）「符號邏輯什誌」（Journal　ofSymbolic　Logic，及社會哲學什誌」（Journal　of　SocialPhilosophy）均仍不斷的出版。此外在戰時新增加的哲學什誌復有下列數種：一是一九三九年出版的「哲學摘錄」（Philosophic　Abstracts），一是一九四〇年出版的「哲學與現象學研究」（Philo　ophy　and　phenomenological　Redearch）及「觀念史什誌」（Journal　of　the　Hiotory　of　sdeas），一是一九四一年出版的「美學與藝術批評雜誌」（Journal　of　Aethetics　andArt　Criticism），一是一九四二年出版的「法律與政治哲學什誌」（Journal　of　Legal　andPolitical　Philosophy），一是一九四三年出版的「哲學論壇」（Philosophical　Forum），又一是一九四五年出版的「拉丁美洲思想」（Latin.AmericanThought）。除最後一種外，這些新出刋物，到現在都仍繼續着。以上各種刋物裏的論文很少是直接與戰爭有關，不過和社會哲學，民主政治，自由，及歷史哲學有關的論文則特別多而已。</p>
<p>其次，且是最重要的部分是，美國哲人在戰時的專門著述。美國哲人在戰時一方面要參加戰爭，一方面仍不停頓他們的專門研究。他們的專門硏究，從戰時所發表的各種專門著作而論，似乎不十分受戰爭的影響。以下將分別的把他們的專門著述，在戰時發表的，簡單的加以介紹。</p>
<p>我們首應提及的是，美國哲人在戰時出版了一種「現存哲人叢書」（The　Library　of　Living　Philosophers），由美國西北大學的P.A.Schilpp氏主編。這種叢書已出版了五種：一是杜咸的哲學，二是桑泰耶拿的哲學，三是懷黑德的哲學，四是摩耳的哲學，五是羅素的哲學。每一種均已包含該一哲人的自傳，討論或批評，該一哲人的哲學論文約二十篇，該一哲人自身的答辯，以及該一哲人的全部著作目錄，我們想明瞭現代著名哲人的哲學，以上五種著作，所說是最有權咸的著述。</p>
<p>次當提及的是，美國哲人對於古典哲學的硏究。關於這一方面的硏究，美國哲人似乎也有了進步。如對於柏拉岡的研究，在戰時出版的，有R.Demos的「柏拉岡哲學」（The　Philosophy　of　Plato）（一九三九年出版），將柏氏哲學加以系統的解釋。其次有G.R.Morrow的「柏拉岡的奴隸法律」（Platols　Law　of　Slavery）（一九三九年出版），A.D.Winspear的「柏拉圖的思想起源」（The　Genesis　of　Platols　Thought）（一九四〇年出版），均是從社會和經濟的觀點去論究柏氏思想的。此外，尙有Richard　Robinson的「柏拉圖較早期的辯證法」（Plato's　Earlier　Dialectic）及Frederick　Solmsen的「柏拉圖的神學」（Plato's　Theology）也是可以注意的。關於亞里土多德的研究，則H.　Cherniss氏發表了兩種著作：一是Aristotle's　Criticism　of　Plato　andthe　Academy（卷一，一九四四年出版），另一是The　Riddle　of　the　Early　Academy（一九四五年出版）。希臘以降的哲人，則比較受忽略很少可提及的著作。惟對十九世紀的哲學，美國方面的硏究，却甚熱鬧。這一時期，歐洲有兩位哲學上的怪傑，一是嘉爾克加（Kierkegaard）一是尼采（Nietzsche）。前者的著作在戰前差不多都沒有英譯本，可是在戰時他的著作却大部分給美國哲人翻譯出來。他的思想已逐漸爲美國哲人所注意。後者雖是美國方面熟知的哲人，然他的思想在戰時也重新爲美國哲人硏究的對象。C.Brinton氏有「論尼采」（Nietasche）（一九四一年出版）一書，專從納粹宣傳與尼采思想有關方面去論究。G.A.Morgan氏的「尼采的意義」（What　Nietzsche　Means）（一九四一年出版）一書，則比較客觀，亦比較同情於尼采的思想。此外，美國哲人對於美國本土哲學的硏究，比起戰前來，復較有興趣。如W.H.Sheldon寫了一本「美國的進步哲學」（America's　ProgressivePhilosophy.1942）T.V.Smitb寫了一本「哲學方式的生活在美國」（The　PhilosophicWay　of　Life　in　America.1943），及H.M.Jones編了一本「美國的觀念」（Ideas　in　America.1944），都是理解美國哲學頗有帮助的書。</p>
<p>最後，在哲學本部裏面，如邏輯，如知識論，如玄學，如倫理學，如美學，美國哲人也各有多少可提及的代表作。邏輯方面有C.C.Pratt的「近代心理學的邏輯」（The　Logic　of　Modern　Psychology.1939）W.V.Quine「數理邏輯」（Mathematical　Logic.1940）。M.R.Cohen的「邏輯緒論」（A.Preface　to　Logic.1944）及R.Carnap的「意義學硏究」（Studies　in　Semantics　vol.Ⅰ.1942,　vol.Ⅱ,1943）。知識論方面，有Brand　Blanshard的「思想的性質」（The　Nature　ofThought,1939）及L.Wood的「知識之分析」（AnalyaisofKnowledge,1941）兩書，前者從唯心論的立塲出發，後者從唯實論的立場出發，均是分析精神，極有價值之作。玄學方面，有J.Maritain的「玄學緒論」（A.Preface　to　Metaphysics,1939），這是解釋中古經院派的觀點。A.N.Whitehead的「思想之方式」（Modes　of　Thouglit,1939）一書，對生命和自然的密切關係有透闢的論究。此外W.T.Stace的「宇宙之性質」（The　Nature　of　the　World,1940）及D.H.Parker的「經騐與實體」（Exerience　and　Substance,1941）兩書，則係從不同方面去提出他們泛心論的系統的。倫理學方面，最可注意的是C.L.Steuenson的「理論學與語言」（Ethics　and　Language,1944）一書，因這是從語言意義的分析上去論究道德概念的。至John　Dewey的「評價學說」和B.E.Jessup的「關係的價値意義」（Relational　Value　Meani不可忽視的著作。美學方面，有K.E.Gibert和H.Kuhn二人合著的「美學史」「History　ofsm,1949）兩書。前一書實爲美學史中最完備的一種。</p>
<p>其他關於社會哲學，政治哲學，歷史哲學等部門，美國哲人亦有可稱道的著作，但限於篇幅，未能盡述。總之，美國哲人在戰時的著述，不論在的方面或量的方面，都是進步的。</p>

<h3>對象底形式與實質</h3>
<p>— 偉裕文</p>
<p>鮑桑克底美學述要之四</p>
<p>審美的情，繫於或相關於審美底對象，特別是對象底形式。審美的心，對於牠底對象，似乎不重視其實質；但欣賞其形式。例如就音樂說，牠不在乎發音的是天籟還是管絃；牠所注意的是聲調；於聲而言調，是着重聲音底形式。就雕刻和書畫說，牠所注意的不是木石或紙　，而是木石或紙墨底表現，或表現的形式。但什麽是形式呢？形式和實質底關系怎樣？</p>
<p>一個對象最粗淺最低下的形式，是其空間的輪廓或樣式。此外，如文法，語法，詩詞底韻律和格式等一般的法則，都是形式之所攝。這種形式是表面的，圖式的，空洞的，純粹的，而與對象底根　或神髓及所謂本質的，真實地內容相反的。這種形式含有虛偽底意襲，例如，沒有誠意的禮儀，我們說是形式的。這種形式似乎和牠底內容不相干，因爲不同的材料似乎可以表現同樣的形式。就這種形式說，對象底形式不是對象底實質，形式與實質不同。</p>
<p>但形式真正可以不受牠底材料底影響，或不影響其材料，而截然與實質不同嗎？不同的材料確乎可以表現一種完全相同的形式嗎？例如，銅像和石膏像可以完全一致地表現同一個人底姿態嗎？事實顯然不是這樣。同時我們都知道，不同的語言，各有其不同的形式，繙譯詩詞的困難就在這裏。這證明不同的材料不能表現院全相同的形式。再從另一方面說，一個深度的同一種顏色表現在不同的質料裏即現爲不同形式的顏色，例如表現在一塊粗布和一塊細呢。朶葵花，和一朶玫瑰中的同一深度的紅是不同的；兩個學養不同而輪廓暹似的面孔也是不同的。這就說形式是隨着牠底材料轉變的。於是我們知道材料能影響形式，形式與實質有密切的關係。同時我們知道，在與實質宛然相反的那表面的形式後面還有實質本來具有的，更根本，更深一層的形式。或者說，每一種材料都有其特有的形式。如黏土，銅，石，畫油，彩色，絲竹，語言等，各有其獨特的形式。牠們底形式即是牠們底條理或其部分之間的連接。牠們這種條理和連接即決定審美的人或藝術家如何處理這些材料或與以更工巧的樣式。這是說實質的形式決定人爲的形式。但使不同的部分變爲統一的有機體，使塊然若止，索然無味的材料成爲興趣昂然，意味無窮，生氣勃勃的對象者，也就是這形式。因此，形式又可影響材料。形式使個體成其爲個體，換言之，即使對象成其爲對象。但使一個體成其爲個體者即此個體之實質或靈魂。於是，形式就是實質了。實質的形式可以表現爲動，可以表現爲生，可以表現爲千變萬化與等級而顯示深奧的意義，所以空間的輪廓及樣式只是牠極粗淺的一層。形式和實質是對象不可分的兩方面。所謂空洞的形式，和絕對的材料都是抽象底結果，所無當於實理。</p>
<p>但形式與實質究竟不同。牠們底不同，猶之乎靈魂與身體底不同。你不能把牠們任何一方面化爲另一方而，兩方面似乎都有其實在性，所以不一。但兩方面都沒有分離的，獨立的實在性；合之則全美，分之則兩傷，所以不異。不一不異，正是形式和實質底關係。</p>
<h3>學林禁話（十）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>白壁德論東西文化</p>
<p>已故美國哈佛大學敎授白壁德（lrving　Babbitt一八六五年至一九三三年）是新人文主義的大師，國內好多位名敎授都出其門下，其學說要旨亦屢經介紹。在白壁德看來，世界自我爲一單位，歷史應該是整個人類的記載。孔子釋迦耶穌和亞里斯多德，其地位是同等重要。美國的地位介於歐洲與遠東之間，應當成爲溝通東西文化的一座橋樑，而不應樹立東方與西方間的壁壘。他希望美國人具有英國民族剛毅的性格，而去掉它一種島國驕矜之氣。就處世態度而論，美國人應採取中法二大民族的優點。</p>
<p>白璧德以爲西方文化的眞正中心在法國的巴黎。他對於巴黎的學術空氣特別感到欣悅，會說道如果能精通法文，留學生在巴黎大學獲益之多，或許會超過於牛津大學裏所能得到的。白氏早年留學法國，一九二三年重至法國，爲巴黎大學交換敎授，曾主講；學程，一以英文講授，題爲英國浪漫派詩人，一以法文講授，題爲盧騷。他的法文深造有得，是邦學人交相讚賞，或謂他在法國的聲譽或尙在美國之上。白氏反對法國盧騷一派的浪漫主義，也不贊成英國維多利亞時代的自然主義，前者偏重感情作用，後者偏重機械作用，特之太過，均爲現代文化之通病。白氏以爲世界大戰乃十九世紀以來不良觀念的自然結果。他所倡導的人文主義乃針對這種缺點而想予以補救。人文主義淵源於希臘文化，而與中國儒學學說相默契。歐洲從文藝復興以後即有多數學者究心於此。惟現代人文主義者必須了解科學之方法與精神，與時偕進，故又稱科學的新人文主義。</p>
<p>白壁德兼通希臘文拉丁文梵文與巴利文。（Pali）他喜歡佛敎過於耶敎，遺著有巴利文佛敎經典（Dhammapada）的英譯本。但以未習漢文，引以爲。憾一九〇〇年他與德魯女士（Rosa　Drew　）在倫敦結婚。白氏生平不曾到過中國，其夫人則生於中國，曾在中國寓居有年。但白氏以爲他自己了解中國的程度非其夫人所能及。夫人　覺不服，以爲他的丈夫未曾來到中國遊歷，親自觀察，何以能够眞正知道中國呢？白氏以爲人之相知，貴相知心，對於一個民族或一個國家也是如是，僅賴官覺未見得就能深切知道共人其人，夫人終于首肯了他</p>
<p>白璧德年四十以後，聲譽漸起，海內外高材生聞風來集，爲其生平快事。我國學者受業於白氏之門下，以宣城梅迪生先生爲最先。梅先生初到劍橋，白氏年方五十，精力充沛，對東方留學生談哲學和宗敎比談文學尤多。白氏於孔子學說具有同感，對中國傳統文化之缺點亦所諗識。白氏住宅書　中懸有中國山水畫數幅，都是中國學生所奉贈。白氏以爲畫中所代表的，不僅僅是山川風物，而是一種天機　落的胸襟，衷心極感愉快。白氏深以孔學的衰落爲可惜，於中國的門人殷殷致其期望，以爲中國的民族復興，其關係不僅是中國一國而巳。</p>
<p>（作者另有「白璧德——當代一人師」一文，載於思想與時代第四十六期梅迪先生紀念號）</p>

<h3>吃（上）</h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>中國人的哲學是建設在吃上的，「國以民爲本，民以食爲天」，這是政治家　話，「食色性也」，「虛其心實其腹」，這是純哲學者的話，「倉　實而知禮義，衣食足而知榮辱」，這又是一種說法。總而言之，沒有吃，一切都麻煩，有了吃，各項皆解決。我們的古代聖賢，久已見及於此，較之西洋之專門爭取民權，又是一個看法。所以，社會上把職業呌做飯盌，而又因其好壞之不同，有金的，鐵的，殘破的之別。有了職業的人，自稱爲「混飯吃」，一如吃了飯就算達到最後目的，其餘都可以不談。</p>
<p>吃的影響所及，第一是物質上的享受，幾乎都集中於吃。俗云：「穿咸風，吃受用。」咸風雖好，到底不如受用，因之道學家勉勵人也便以「能咬得菜根，百事可作」爲修養的標準了。——他們完全沒有想到今日難民連爛菜葉子都當作寳貝，可是這些可憐蟲，却只有受罪的分兒，幹什麽都沒他們的機會！——反過來，達官貴人，一旦有了過多的錢，最容易表示闊綽的也是吃，曾讀李岳瑞春冰室野乘，其中有講河道官員之侈奢一條，幾乎完全是在飲食上打主意的，什麼爲了吃鴨掌就把鴨子趕在炙了火的磚地上亂跑呀，爲了吃豬裏脊不惜殺幾十口豬呀，更奇怪的乃是世所艷稱的吃猴腦，把豢養得「腦滿腸肥」猴子，穿上紅色衣服，頭頂剃光，鑽到開了孔的方桌中，鐵鎚一擊，天門大開，賓客乃各以預置的銀勺舀取新鮮腦髓食之，竟也居然有人幹得出來，吃得下去！此外則廣東人吃蛇及狸，美其名曰「龍虎鬥」，福建人（或是廣東人）吃用蜜喂養的小老鼠，在愛羅先珂聽了，都是笑料，而且即在全世界各野蠻民族中，此項吃法與對象也足以居上乘而無愧色的！外國人吃飯爲營養，爲工作熱量，中國人却是不大考究這一套，有錢的老爺太太雖然也要進補，或是公子小姐要滋陰壯陽，但那是超出營養與熱量之外的事，而且是看成了藥品，不是飯食。戰後英倫，即使你是部院大臣，每星期不過配給一只鷄蛋，四五磅麵包，至於肉類和脂肪更是有限之至，他們雖然也苦得不可開交，可是照樣忍受着熬下去，若在我們中國，則必天下大亂矣。從前羅素到中國旅行，湖南督軍招待宴會，從正午一直吃到下午三四點鐘，菜還沒有上完，羅氏却早已吃得不能再吃了，只好表示吃完，中國方面的要人都笑話他沒有見過世面，前清的滿漢全席，據說正菜要有一百二十品，即使一分鐘吃一樣，還得足足吃兩個鐘頭呢，何况再加上喝酒豁拳？古人已經說過「食前力丈」的話，而王莾作皇帝的時候，據康有爲的新學僞經考說，劉歆他們特別僞造了周禮來逢迎這篤占嗜學的野心家，說什麽周公規定皇帝的御膳是每餐百二十品，迎　都得作一百二十缸，迎帶的三夫人九嬪二十七世婦八十一御妻也正好是一百廿位老婆，或者後來之全席，即　於此歟？如果此話不錯的話，我國吃的歷史，蓋亦悠也久也矣。</p>
<p>其次便是由吃而衍變成的文化層種種形態，例如講吃的食譜，食　，講酒的酒令，觴政，講儀　的禮書，祭典——人好吃，神鬼也是好吃的，甲骨文中有先妣特祭殺至三百牛的記載，你看可驚不可驚？古人說亡了國，也只說「祖宗不血食」，彷彿人雖死了，吃的問題依舊存在，而且非常嚴重。祭字本身就是持肉獻神，更是明白。外國人以鮮花供養死人，中國是不作興的。——乃至因飲食而發生的故事笑料，這些東西，在過去的出版物中，很占重要位置。有人把中國文化，恭維成吃的文化，一種李鴻章雜碎已使外國牛排望風却步，要是把我們的炸炒溜煎燴煮……的全套武藝拿出來，豈不使洋兒子吃瘍？並且中國的烹調，又是非常抽象的，不比外國人把沙士和鹹鹽都注出多少Gram，我們的「易牙工夫」，乃是全憑老司務的經驗，看火候，看顏色，同樣的魚翅，給譚故院長作過廚司的某人某人燒出來，就與衆不同，老菜館裏一定得有幾種拿手菜，不是別人可以仿效的，而老吃客也必須能有挑剔或指示各種菜蔬的本領，從前北京的廣和居不是就有「潘魚」「江豆腐」的說法嗎？迄今北平西長安街的菜館，都有所謂「馬先生湯」，據說是馬敍倫指點的，未知確否？總之，東方精神文明，不但要表現於言論思想，即在飲食，亦是毫無二致的。故即使照着隨園食單去燒各種小菜，恐怕結果必遭失敗也。</p>
<h3>誠實的廣告</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>商業廣吿在一般人的心目中是「吹噓和誇張」，而做這種廣吿的商人也的確不乏抱這種熊度的。</p>
<p>「今天的蕃茄太熟了。最好等到明天來買。」——你相信這是一張廣吿的辭句嗎？事實上它的確是的，是好萊塢的「農夫市塲」所做的廣吿。</p>
<p>「農夫市塲」的廣吿主任爾賴德。勃克自從市塲在一九三四年開張以來就抱定「說老實話」的主義。他的誠實，造成了市塲的繁榮。</p>
<p>有一家大電影公司在數年前慕勃克氏之名，以重金將他禮聘了去。剛一上任，他的新老闆就把他喚去，問他計劃如何做法。</p>
<p>「我要講實話」，勃克說，「假如我們的一張片子是糟不可言，我便說：『諸位，你們今天晚上最好還是耽在家裏聽聽　綫電。」假如我們的一張片子是好的，我就勸吿他們趕緊抄近路到當地的戲院去看。」</p>
<p>那位老闆聽了大吃一驚，顯出「另請高明」的窘相，第二天勃克便愉快的打回老家，重與蔬菜和他的老主顧們爲伍了。</p>
<p>像勃克這類的銷貨員在美國並不是獨一年偶的，下面是一些簡單的例子：</p>
<p>紐約向約翰璜納梅克有一次登廣吿說：「我們有一批無價値的雨衣，現售一塊四毛九一件。」可是，第二天雨衣却全部傾銷一空。</p>
<p>有一個燈罩商爲推銷一塊錢一隻的燈罩登廣吿說：「當然這種燈罩沒有昂貴的羊皮紙所做的那般的耐用。假如太靠近燈泡，罩上的紙也許要變黑。它們大槪可用一兩個夏天。」</p>
<p>紐約的沙氏商店說：「我們付得太多，我們買得太多。坦白的說，我們週轉不靈了。」下面有一段話是：「現有三大件裝有彈簧　器具出售。舒服，不過難着。情讓一百四十元，當可有助共外觀之改造。」</p>
<p>登這類廣吿的商人用　直建立了信譽，所以當他們貢獻一些値得買得東西的時候，人們對他們便深信不疑了。他們通常也能够將他們所貶抑的貨物在脫——假如價格的確是低廉的話。</p>
<h3>臺灣新年風人俗</h3>
<p>— 蔭祥</p>
<p>台灣民間的風俗，和其他各省差不多，他們也很熱鬧地過舊曆年，正月開頭的三天，也是一沿舊俗。</p>
<p>正月初一那天，是團圓好日子，大家在家裏過的。凡出嫁的女兒，那一天是不許回娘家的，否則她就是希望她娘家貧窮。</p>
<p>新年拜年的俗禮，是要在初二的那天舉行·台灣的氣候很和暖，四季如初夏，無冬寒，所以陳菜是擺不上三天就要壞了，所以規定初二的那天是宴客日。如果有新嫁娘的，一定要伴着新郞官在那天歸寗，照風俗這該要娘家派一個人帶了一些禮物到女婿的家去，表示請新娘向娘家玩，女婿便買了一些答拜的禮物帶去。新娘這天穿戴得很漂亮，回到娘家，先給父母道喜，說了許多吉利話，那時母親的喜悅無可形容，拿出年糕和許多女兒所歡喜的東西來給女兒吃，新娘就可以大吃大嚼，和姊妹們喝春酒，盡情歡樂，互道婆家的一切，有的酒後還結伴逛街或打牌，或看戲。岳父母迷着笑眼看女婿，姨舅們可以開開新婿的玩笑。一切人家，都一樣熱鬧地過這初二日，一直到天黑了，新夫妻才回婆家。這一天也因此又俗稱做「雙人返」。</p>
<p>年初二是三天之中最熱鬧的一天，大家狂歡着，街上也盡是穿紅着綠的女人，這一天汽車黄包車的生意特別好。</p>
<p>第三天，却是特別相　，民俗稱做「赤狗日」，是一個頂不吉利的日子，沒有大事，都不出門，以免衝撞着什麼星然。（舊曆新年於台北）</p>
<h3>自動減價</h3>
<p>— 言平</p>
<p>近年來，所聽見的總是一連串的漲價和調整，所以偶然聽見一聲「不漲價」，便感到興奮，倘過到名符其實的「大减價」，那一定反而認爲詫異了。</p>
<p>學費已經當局規定。然而，尙有少數的私校，還認爲太低，不敷開支，因此敎育局爲了防止浮收，超渦標準起見，李局長已決定親自抽査，以社流弊。誰知在這防止超過的情形下，竟會有「暴跌價」的發現！</p>
<p>南市的情形，的確不能和北市相比。單就毗連北市的小世界一帶而言、私立小學，屈指難計、一向收費低於規定，而今次的情形，更是出於意料。私立小學的收費，規定是二百萬元，可是南市一帶的招貼上，各校的收費，往往不足規定的半數，甚至僅及規定四分之一！</p>
<p>這情形，當然是一般家長所歡迎的。但是爲了漲價聲中的暴跌價，於是引起了研究的價値。</p>
<p>南市各校的開支，固然比之北市略省，但，總省不到半數或四分之一，南北市的敎師，同樣需要最低限度的生活。</p>
<p>那麼，怎會有暴跌猛减的現象？據學校當局說是爲顧到家畏的景况，降低到家長負祖所可能的範圍，免使失學兒童激增，而這些學校中，一部份有董事會，或各公會職工會等，負担着經常費用，原係半義務性質，所以减低收費，倒並不影　到敎師的待遇。</p>
<p>這些學校的「自動减價」已給一般學店老闆當頭棒喝！希望一般爲敎育而興學的學校，能一　致的影響起來！</p>
<h3>春風依然</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>巴幾年沒有過舊曆年了。舊曆年已廢，想來已無歡渡的必要。但眼看人家興冲冲的樣子，心中未免納罕。此番從南京僕僕的趕回了上海，用一隻眼睛睥睨着舊曆年，依然看得了春風。</p>
<p>我看着大堆的人們在下關排着長蛇陣。爲了年關還鄉旅客的衆多，車票是更難買了，幾個心焦如焚的便開始騷動起來。警察抓住了他們的衣領，一個惶恐的向警士解釋：「我要回家過年啊！」旅客幾乎一式的帶了油鷄或板鴨。一個姊姊模樣的在囑咐她的弟弟：「告訴母親，我雖然不能回家過年，但拜年錢還是要的·你要替我留着！」車過丹陽，頗多的旅客都已入睡。我欣賞着瞌睡的各式姿態，猜着他們的美夢。</p>
<p>感謝口福，我吃了四頓年飯，三頓是全席，一頓是在一個境况稍差的朋友家吃的。塲合雖然不同，但吃年飯的心情是一樣的。無論闊人家也好，寒酸朋友家也好，這一頓飯都是他們一年中最溫暖的。孩子可以放膽大嚼，再也不必留意大人的眼色了；妻子將鷄腿夾在丈夫的碗上：「怎麽你這樣的客氣啊！」父親不斷的向兒女們嚷着：「請啊！請啊！」好似他們並不是天天在一起吃飯一樣。</p>
<p>舊曆年在現狀下，還是多數人們最溫暖的節日。年賞與分紅使人們的衣袋顯得沉重起來；舉債的人們，因臘底已過，也顯得兩肩輕飄了。我看見那些終年碌碌的人們，在新年中獲得了溫情。娛樂塲所給一年難得去一次的人們擁塞着。我謝絕了二個朋友新春看電影的邀請，我用責問的口氣說；「你要搶去他們的溫暖嗎？」打年鼓的卡車在馬路上飛馳，爆竹在耳際飛舞，骰子聲在家門內響着……</p>
<p>舊曆年已廢，但春風依然！</p>
<h3>項羽故里</h3>
<p>— 柏</p>
<p>頃閱二月十九日申報自由談，載有柯曼君「訪項羽故里」一文。謂項里在「越西南」，與作者所遊，頗有出入。僅就所知，述之如后：</p>
<p>按「項羽本紀」，項王爲下相人，「下相」據辭源釋爲今江蘇宿遷縣，宿遷爲作者舊遊之地，故知之頗諗。「項王故里」在宿遷南門外約里許，戰前闢爲項里公園，並附設有項里小學，中瓦舍一　，內貯巨碑，上書「項王故里」四擘窠大字。老槐一株，兀立其側，父老相傳，謂王所手植也。園內頗多題詠，如張之江，賴璉，吳邁，易君左等均有，作者猶憶易君左且有「楚客長征別霸王，宿遷草木盡芬芳」之句焉。</p>
<p>宿遷南門內更有項王廟，戰前關爲項王廟小學，毘連省立高級玻璃科職校（宿遷爲者名玻璃產地），廟內供有項王虞姬像，駢坐於上。梅蘭芳演別姬一劇，盛極一時，當時爲求其逼眞計，曾遴人遄往攝照，惜王像儒雅，雖非如張良之爲太史公譽爲「美好如女子」，究不似後人傳說之兇惡，政未登舞合，卒令金少山爲「霸王」之飾也。</p>
<p>再虞姬爲宿遷鄰邑沭陽之虞溝崖人，故宿人往往謔謂與沭人爲中表親，蓋即戲溯此段姻緣也。（却酬）</p>
<h3>歐洲皇室的煩惱</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>在歐洲尙留下的幾個皇室差不多都遭到同樣的煩惱：公主多於太子，有幾個根本就沒有男的王位繼承者。</p>
<p>大家知道，大英皇室只有兩個公主，而伊麗莎白公主最近才和蒙巴頓上尉結婚的。荷蘭王位繼承人裘麗娜公主新近又產生了第四個女孩，這樣以來，從一八八四年起，這王位上就沒有男子坐過了。更糟的是丹麥，菲德力太子只有三個女孩，按丹麥法律，公主是不能繼承王位的。一直到一九四六年四月後，瑞典的皇室也才稍爲得到點安慰，阿道爾夫王在已有了四個公主後最後才得到一個男孩。而挪威王室的奧拉夫太子也是有了一大羣女孩後才有一個珍貴的男孩這男孩到現在只有九歲。羅馬尼亞更慘，國王米契爾至始是個鰥夫，即到參加伊麗莎伯公主的婚禮時，他才爲丹麥的安妮公主的美麗而感動，但議會諸公又不成人之美，沒有同意這件婚事，逼得米契爾丢棄了王座已訂五月裏與安妮公主結婚了，並且結束了這個可憐的皇朝。希臘的喬治王已和皇后離婚，迄無再娶之意，太子更談不到。比利時皇室更失去中心，到現在還是由個攝政王在代理國事。</p>
<p>除了王位的繼承者多是女的外，更嚴重是這麽多的公主要想找到地位相當的丈夫幾乎是太難了，因爲她　的丈夫必定是其他皇室的太子或者親王才行。將來如何解決這問題，只有上帝知道了。</p>
<h3>華盛頓的座右銘</h3>
<p>— 無咎</p>
<p>這裏是華盛頓在少年自己寫下的座右銘——</p>
<p>別人遭遇到不幸時，不可存欣喜之心，即使遭遇到不幸的人是你的仇人，你也不應當幸災樂禍。聽到侮蔑別人的話時，切勿輕信。</p>
<p>衣服務求樸素，不可標新立異。</p>
<p>如果你珍惜自己的名譽，就該和品性高潔之士交友。與其和壞人做朋友，寗可孤獨。</p>
<p>自己能勝任的事情，切勿輕易答應別人；但旣然答應了別人，就必須實踐自己的諾言。</p>
<p>努力培育心頭這一點美好的小火花——這小火花的名字是「良心」。</p>

<h3>Brewing Major Battle in Western Shenyang; Many Northeastern Bandits Gather in Xinmin; Powerful National Army from Inside the Pass Deployed to Reinforce Defense</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 23rd] A major battle is brewing in Xinmin, west of Shenyang. Battles are currently taking place on the east, south, and north sides of Juliu River, northeast of Xinmin. Since the 21st, bandits have been gathering in this area. National Army forces are very strong in the Liuhugou area, south of Xinmin. The bandits seem to be attempting to open up three battlefields, with the main battlefield in Xinmin, the northern battlefield possibly between Kaiyuan and Tieling, where many bandits who fled from Tongjiangkou have gathered near Kaiyuan. These bandits near Kaiyuan are from the 10th Column and Han Communist Li Hongguang's detachment. The southern battlefield seems to be Yingkou, with bandits fleeing from Anshan to the Niuzhuang area. The National Army is preparing to counterattack. In the northwest area of Shenyang, bandits are harassing the area of Wanjintai and Laobian, about 30 kilometers away, but their numbers are small and their role is to create a diversion.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 23rd] It is rumored that the bandits who have fled to the Xinmin area are from the 1st, 7th, and 8th Columns, and they seem to be planning to first seize and destroy the Juliu River Railway Bridge with their main force, and then attack Xinmin. There has already been contact in the area near the Juliu River Bridge.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 23rd] (1) After the Communist bandits in western Liaoning occupied Dahushan, they are actively repairing the railway from Tongliao to Jin Shen (Jinxi-Shenyang), and are currently continuing to build from Xinlitun to Dahushan. However, this section has not yet been completed due to air raids. (2) A certain National Army unit from inside the Pass will reinforce the Jin Yu (Jinxi-Yingkou) section outside the Pass, and Fan's army group outside the Pass will be able to actively advance eastward.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Sources say: The equipment at the Anshan Iron Mine has not suffered major damage, but the station has been completely destroyed. On the 23rd, the air force dispatched planes to bomb the area.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] National Army sources admitted on the 23rd to another serious setback: Faku, 40 miles north of Shenyang, has been abandoned, allowing the Communist army to intensify its blockade of Shenyang and to attack from the north. Faku is a key point on the highway and protects the west side of Tieling and Kaiyuan. The Communist army is now attacking these two places. In the Anshan area, the Communist army is heading towards Yingkou with a large force of about nine divisions, and is expected to attack Fushun and Yingkou simultaneously. However, National Army troops and supplies are still arriving in Yingkou.</p>
<h3>Soviet Radio Station Publicly Claims Communist Bandits Plan to Occupy Shenyang; US Embassy Denies Withdrawal of Staff and Dependents from Shenyang Consulate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A US Embassy spokesman said on the 23rd that he was unaware of reports from Shanghai that the State Department had ordered the families of US consulate personnel in Shenyang to "leave immediately."</p>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 22nd] The Chinese Air Force suddenly stopped flying to Shenyang today, and the situation there is becoming more urgent. At the same time, the US State Department has advised the dependents of US consulate staff there to withdraw immediately. Mrs. Ward, the Consul General, is expected to arrive in Tianjin tomorrow. Mr. Dalsden, a Seventh-day Adventist missionary, arrived here from Shenyang on the 20th and said that the situation in Shenyang was "intolerable". The Communist army is generally attacking the Hun River Airport, one and a half miles southwest of Shenyang. Listening to Soviet radio broadcasts in Shenyang, it is openly stated that the Communist army is now planning to occupy Shenyang because it needs the China Changchun Railway. The news of the Chinese Air Force canceling flights to Shenyang was released by Roselot, the representative of Chennault's Air Transport Group stationed in Shenyang. However, according to Mr. Bridge, the Shandong District Manager of the Air Transport Group, the team plans to send planes to Shenyang six times to evacuate foreigners, while consulate staff will remain in place. It is feared that the Hun River Airport has fallen or is about to fall. Air Transport Group planes are landing at the Dongda Airport, about ten miles from the city. Twenty-one British missionaries and six employees of the British American Tobacco Company are expected to fly out of Shenyang tomorrow. Dalsden also said that residents of Shenyang are lacking food, and many families are committing suicide. Babies who are only a month old are mostly fed corn. Coal is not for sale, and prices are so high that they are almost beyond purchasing power. A bag of flour weighing eight pounds sells for about US$15. Two or three police officers are stationed at every street corner, and when food occasionally enters the city, it is escorted by heavy troops. There is no way to leave except by air. Soldiers are not allowed to ride in mule carts.</p>
<h3>Yangcun Town on the Pingjin (Beiping-Tianjin) Line Harassed, Burned, and Looted by Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 23rd] More than 3,000 Communist bandits, equipped with short-range cannons, suddenly harassed Yangcun Station along the Pingjin Railway at about midnight on the morning of the 22nd, and first attacked the station. They were repelled by local forces, and then invaded the town, burning and looting. At 6:00 AM, they fled towards Baodi County.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the bandits who attacked Yangcun withdrew from the town on the morning of the 22nd, they were still entrenched north of the town on the morning of the 23rd. The National Army began to mop up on the 23rd. Gunfire was heard very intensely in Yangcun in the morning, and the battle is ongoing.</p>
<h3>Bandits Cleared from the Outskirts of Lanfeng; National Army in Western Shandong Recaptures Kaocheng</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 23rd] There are no more traces of bandits in the outskirts of Lanfeng. The National Army in western Shandong recaptured the city of Kaocheng on the 21st. Currently, the areas of Shanxian, Juye, and Kaocheng are all controlled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chen Yi's 10th and 11th Columns and part of the 8th Column of bandits on the border of Henan and Anhui were forced to flee in three directions after being severely suppressed by the National Army for several days. One group is still based in Taipingji, east of Xiacheng. One group fled south from Jiegouji (northeast of Hao County), and another group fled southwest from Mapuji and Chenji (both in northwest Hao County). The National Army is in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 23rd] Sources say: Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's troops have recently moved in western Shandong, attempting to gather in Hebei Province. The military situation in Shandong Province has become a matter of extreme concern.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 23rd] The Communist bandits in Shandong and Henan have recently launched an "Anti-Offensive Alliance." All landlords, gentry, and local ruffians in the bandit areas who join the "Alliance" are "soldiers of the Second Battlefield and the Fifth Column," but they must go to the government area to act as spies for the bandits, spread rumors to incite workers' and students' strikes, and carry out sabotage and arson.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Shaanxi Mobilize, Planning to Invade Yulin and Yan'an</h3>

The National Army is closely guarding against them on all fronts.</p>

<h3>Taft, Martin, and Judd Vociferously Advocate Military Aid to China; Future Peace in the Far East More Important than in Europe</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Influential Republican members of Congress vigorously advocated on the 23rd that there should be more military assistance to China. Senator Taft of Ohio and Speaker of the House Martin severely criticized the government authorities for failing to include strong anti-communist military assistance in their $570 million aid-to-China plan. In a speech he prepared to deliver at Detriot, Taft stated: "The reality of reviving China and the value of such relief is an open question, but we must give the Chinese government weapons and ammunition sufficient to resist the communist forces in the Northeast, just as we are resisting communist forces in Greece." Taft pointed out that the "crux of the situation" was Marshall's "dislike of the Chinese and disinterest in the Chinese issue." He also said: "Unless immediate and active action is taken, the entire Northeast will fall to communism. If the Northeast is controlled by communism, we can well expect that Japan will not be immune to its infiltration in the future."</p>
<p>Martin agreed with Taft's opinion, believing that the government's request for an anti-communist aid-to-Europe plan, while simultaneously opposing effective aid to China, was contradictory. He said: Regardless of Marshall's statement last week that China cannot effectively use the assistance that has already been given, he still insists that military assistance must be given to China. He expects that Congress will at least approve part of the government's requested $570 million aid-to-China plan, but he further expects that members of Congress will demand that weapons and military supplies be given to the Chiang Kai-shek government.</p>
<p>Taft said that the policy toward China "will undermine everything the Marshall Plan has attempted to establish in Europe in the Far East." He said: "It was largely due to Vandenberg that the government authorities were finally forced to abandon the policy of appeasement toward the Soviet Union. He deeply believed that pursuing such a policy would accomplish nothing, and strongly influenced former Secretary of State Byrnes until we finally determined to absolutely oppose the continued expansion of the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>He pointed out that the current policy toward China "completely violates the traditional policy of the Republican Party." I firmly believe that in the end, the future peace in the Far East must be more important than in Europe, and we should give the same concern to the progress of communism on the other side of the Pacific as we do in Europe.</p>
<p>[United Press, Atlantic City, 22nd] Republican Congressman Judd declared on the night of the 22nd that even if the Marshall Plan succeeds, it will still be divided into two major camps: on one side will be the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and on the other side will be the United States and the sixteen countries of Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and a small number of other countries. If the United States wants to win the political war against the Soviet Union, it is essential to give financial and military aid to China. If China falls, the Soviet Union will rely on its fifth column to control the largest part of the manpower on the planet, and the United States only needs to spend less than 1.5 billion yuan to restore peace and economic security to China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] Former President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, Kong Xiangxi, told the Associated Press on the 22nd that China greatly welcomes the $570 million aid plan that may be obtained in the US Congress, but military aid is even more important.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] Wallace, the Third Party presidential candidate in the United States, issued a written statement on the 22nd stating that President Truman's aid-to-China plan is "provocative of war." He demanded a complete withdrawal of American "financial and military intervention" in China. He said: If we provide financial assistance to the "Chinese government, it is another stage in our financial and military intervention in China." Wallace declared: The government's aid-to-China plan "is a clear indication of the inevitable failure of our current foreign policy, and the Marshall Plan is only a part of that policy." Wallace's statement was directed against Truman's "plea that $570 million represents purely civil and economic assistance." He cited so-called "examples of military intervention, including 1,000 US military officers assisting in the training of 10 divisional new recruits, the "secret" construction of bases in Qingdao and Taiwan, the "frequent" patrolling of the Chinese sea by the US Navy, and the transfer of 271 naval ships and aircraft to the Chinese government." (Editor's note: Wallace is currently campaigning.)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Stuart on Foreign Aid: Should Rely on Self-Management</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 23rd] Ambassador Stuart met with reporters again at 3:00 PM on the 23rd, reiterating his consistent support for Chairman Chiang and the National Government. Ambassador Stuart believes that the Chinese government and people should find a common ideal, then all external aid can be effectively applied, but external aid is generally economic, at most military, while politics must rely on self-help. Even if external aid can come from a sustainable source, it must be managed by oneself. The conditions for managing it are divided into two aspects: government and people. On the government side, it should help the people to exercise their civil rights, and at the same time try to allow the people to enjoy the rights of the four freedoms. On the people's side, they should find ways to contribute their own strength to assist the government in completing democratic politics. Ambassador Stuart further stated that he had contacted many Chinese people, such as professors, students, reporters, etc., and they all showed a negative or attacking, or even opposing, attitude toward the government. In fact, they should supervise the government and make constructive criticisms at any time to help the government complete democratic politics.</p>
<h3>Story of Mediation in Civil War Denied by Soviet Embassy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding the report by the Associated Press of the United States that a certain official from the Soviet Union stationed in China had informally expressed to our government his intention to mediate the civil war, a spokesman for the Soviet Embassy here told reporters on the morning of the 23rd: "This news has no basis."</p>
<h3>Zheng Dongguo Concurrently Appointed Commander of the First Army Group; Flew to Nanjing from Beiping Yesterday to Request Instructions; Fan Hanjie Scheduled to Go South Today to Discuss Policy for Governance of Jehol</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 23rd] Zheng Dongguo was ordered to concurrently serve as commander of the First Army Group. After receiving the order, Zheng came to Beiping from Shenyang yesterday, and transferred to the capital by military aircraft this afternoon to request instructions from the central government. The original commander of the First Army Group was Fan Hanjie. After Fan was ordered to govern Jehol, he was no longer able to take care of the military affairs of the Beining Railway, so Zheng was appointed as his concurrent replacement. Zheng told reporters that Shenyang had been trending towards stability in recent days. The bandits have five columns near Shenyang and three columns near Anshan. At present, the Northeast relies only on air supply. If a land route can be opened up, the overall situation can be reversed. Zheng emphasized that the Northeast currently needs to win battles, and to win battles, weapons, ammunition, and food are indispensable. He did not deny that two divisions of the National Army had already come from Shanghai to support the north. When reporters asked about the current military value of Changchun, Jilin, and Siping, and what contributions Northeast veterans Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Ma Zhanshan might make to the current situation in the Northeast, he did not answer, but praised that the ice and snow in Shenyang were gradually melting, and there was already a hint of spring.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 23rd] The newly appointed Chairman of Jehol Province, Fan Hanjie, is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 24th to request instructions from the central government on the policy of governing Jehol. It is reported that Fan will devote himself to developing the military and political affairs of Jehol, so as to eliminate the threat from the north side of the Beining Railway and block the connection between the communist bandits in the Northeast and North China. After receiving the order, Fan came to Beiping from Qinhuangdao, and met with Li Zongren and Fu Zuoyi frequently. It is heard that a plan for developing the military and political affairs of Jehol has already been drafted. Fan will take this plan to request instructions from the central government. According to a source familiar with the matter, the military affairs of Jehol will be closely coordinated with the Northeast (especially Jinzhou) in the future, the political affairs will learn from Chahar and Suiyuan in organizing and training the people's armed forces, and the economy will strengthen ties with Beiping and Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Shandong Industrial and Commercial Loans Need More Than 900 Billion</h3>
<p>Reports from Representatives of Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 23rd] At the economic symposium hosted by the Jinan branch of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, representatives of various trade associations in Jinan reported on the actual situation of industry and commerce in Jinan, saying that Jinan has a population of about 700,000, needing 800,000 catties of grain per day. The current grain reserves are extremely low, and the surrounding areas are occupied by communist bandits. Less than 200,000 catties of grain are entering the city every day. When the new wheat arrives on the market, Jinan will lack 70 million catties of grain, and it is necessary to find a way to import grain from abroad to alleviate the famine. Furthermore, in order to save the industry and commerce of Shandong, the loans needed are: the textile industry and the flour industry each need to borrow 120 billion, the dyeing and weaving industry needs 90 billion, the oil pressing industry needs 20 billion, the match industry needs 60 billion, and together with other general industries and businesses, more than 900 billion in loans are needed. The industrial and commercial circles of Jinan unanimously requested Liu Zhendong, a member of the National Economic Commission who came to Shandong to inspect the actual situation of the Jinan economy, to appeal on their behalf when he returns to Nanjing on the 23rd and submit a report.</p>
<h3>Special Review Committee of the Four Joint Offices Decides on Principles for Agricultural Loans; Bank Deposit Interest Rates to be Raised</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Special Review Committee of the Four Joint Offices held a subcommittee meeting at 3 PM on the 23rd to review the agricultural loan plan and cooperative loan plan submitted by the Four Joint Council on the 21st. Xu Kan presided over the meeting, which was attended by Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Guofu, Chen Qitian, Xu Baiyuan, Xue Dubi, Li Shuming, and Shou Miancheng. Responsible individuals from the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury were also present. The agricultural loan plan under review was divided into three parts: (1) the Farmers Bank's proposed emergency agricultural loan plan for the first half of the 37th year (already seen in this newspaper on the 23rd), (2) the Farmers Bank's proposed "Measures for Trial Implementation of Agricultural Loans in the 37th Year: Cash Loans with Real Goods Collection, and Cash Loans for Real Goods Purchase" (published in the first column of the second page), and (3) the Central Cooperative Treasury's loan plan for the 37th year (published in the first column of the second page). During the discussion, the principles decided by the Four Joint Council on the 21st were first consulted, and then the measures proposed by the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury were discussed item by item. Because some techniques still needed further study, it was decided to hold review meetings again on the 26th and 28th to make a final decision, submit it to the Si Lian Council next Thursday for approval, and then report it to the Chairman for approval before implementation. In the review meeting on the 23rd, it was generally agreed that the main targets of agricultural loans should be food, cotton, and export materials, and that loans should be issued in kind as much as possible. The principle of "cash loans with real goods collection" proposed by the Farmers Bank was advocated to be deleted in the meeting. Cash loans can only be used for specific loans. If cash loans are given completely, it will be contrary to the principle of curbing inflation. In the past, it was hoped that agricultural loan funds would be raised by various banks and bureaus themselves, but this has proven difficult. Zhang Jia'ao has agreed to have the Central Bank supply them, but hopes that the amount will not be too large. In addition, various banks and bureaus will increase interest rates to attract deposits. The meeting also discussed the issue of overlapping loan businesses between the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury, and decided that the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury will hold a joint review meeting on the 26th to discuss the division of business. Three principles have been decided on the 23rd: (1) If both parties need to handle the business, the two parties will handle it together, but the regions should be divided, such as cotton, which will be jointly handled by both parties. (2) In areas where the cooperative foundation is solid or the foundation is generally sound, the loan business will be handled by the Cooperative Treasury. (3) Loans suitable for cooperative methods will be handled by the Cooperative Treasury. The total amount of agricultural loans was not determined at the meeting on the 23rd. The Farmers Bank of China originally planned to provide more than 550 billion yuan in emergency loans for the first half of this year, but on the 23rd it proposed that the loans for the second half of the year also be allocated for use in the first half. The original plan of 883 billion for land and financial loans in the agricultural loan section will not be changed. For the Cooperative Treasury, it is planned to increase wheat loans by 400 billion yuan and food loans by 100 billion yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The competent authorities have decided to revise the deposit interest rates of various banks and bureaus, which will be increased according to the market interest rate standards, and may be formulated by themselves with reference to the different interest rates in various regions, in order to attract deposits. However, the interest rate is still slightly lower than the market rate. This method can be approved for implementation.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of the Ashida Cabinet</h3>
<p>After the Japanese Katayama Cabinet submitted its resignation this month, the four parties have been consulting and negotiating for ten days on the nomination of the next prime minister. Jiyuto's Yoshida and Minshuto's Ashida were both popular and refused to give way to each other, so they resorted to a nomination vote in the Diet on the 21st. The election results in the House of Representatives: Ashida won 216 votes, Yoshida won 180 votes, and Katayama won 8 votes. Ashida was nominated as Prime Minister. In the second election in the House of Councillors, Yoshida won 104 votes and Ashida won 102 votes, both of which did not reach the majority of 218 votes. According to Article 67 of the Japanese Constitution, the resolution of the House of Representatives is the resolution of the parliament, so although Ashida did not win an overwhelming majority of votes, it has actually been decided that he will be the next Prime Minister, which is an inevitable trend. Now, Ashida has established a cabinet formation headquarters in Yuezhong and is about to convene the Jiyu, Social, and Cooperative parties to hold a policy agreement meeting. Like Katayama's New Cabinet last year, Ashida hopes to form a four-party coalition cabinet and take the four-party policy agreement as the new cabinet's policy guidelines. However, according to reports from Tokyo in the past two days, it is difficult for the Jiyu party to cooperate with Ashida, and even Saito Takao, the honorary president of the Democratic Party, has expressed his refusal to allow the left wing of the Socialist Party to join the cabinet. Stubborn conservative newspapers have unanimously criticized Ashida for cooperating with the left wing. Ashida is on the verge of a cliff, with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow. He is struggling on a difficult road. The selection of new cabinet personnel these days is probably more important than policy consultation. It is difficult to predict whether the cabinet will be successfully formed smoothly this week or encounter any risks.</p>
<p>Hitoshi Ashida is a lucky man in Japanese politics today. With the Minshuto party's weak mass base and minority party status in the third place in the parliament, he was able to leap to the dragon gate in today's chaotic political situation, overwhelming Yoshida with one hand and holding the left wing with the other. Undoubtedly, he is more successful than the simple Katayama, and he is more popular than the sophisticated Yoshida. In fact, Ashida's success this time is entirely due to his ability to use the environment well. He was able to unite these contradictions in a speculative way between the confrontation between the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party and the contradictions between the left and right wings of the Socialist Party. He succeeded himself and also improved the status of the Democratic Party. First, due to the division of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party Congress on January 16 passed a bill to abolish the four-party agreement, which caused the Katayama Cabinet to lose its basis for existence. In addition, Katayama Tetsuya's attitude was strong and he took the middle road without leaning to the left, so the left wing of the Socialist Party used the budget committee of the House of Representatives to cut the funds of the Ministry of Finance. The Katayama Cabinet was already facing a currency crisis. It was impossible to stop it, and this attack by the House of Representatives brought down the Katayama Cabinet. Ashida was an important pillar of the Katayama Cabinet. As Foreign Minister, he had the status of Deputy Prime Minister. He supported Katayama, cooperated with the right wing of the Socialist Party, Nishio, and sympathized with the Socialist Party's left wing in the opposition, Kato and Suzuki. He was resourceful and well-connected. In this nomination for Prime Minister, the Socialist Party and the Cooperative Party supported him, and the Socialist Party and the Cooperative Party supported him in the Diet vote, so he was able to overwhelm the Liberal Party and other conservative parties with the majority of the Democratic, Social, and Cooperative parties. This is Ashida's luck, this is Ashida's wit. Second, Katayama took office in June last year and formally stepped down from the position of Prime Minister after only nine months. During these nine months, the Katayama Cabinet was constantly attacked by the Liberal Party and threatened by the conservative New Party Movement. The reason why the Katayama Cabinet was shaking but not falling was not because Katayama was determined to do things, nor was it because the socialist policy was successful. Most of it was due to Ashida's cooperation and support. He was able to use his wit to deal with the anti-government factions, and he was able to stand up when Katayama was hesitant and provide strong assistance to the Katayama Cabinet, so he was able to benefit from the Fisheries problem; so he was able to inherit after Katayama resigned, so he was able to speculate in the two major contradictions between society and freedom. Since Ashida's success is so wonderful, he is by no means an accidental person or an ordinary person. If he succeeds in forming a cabinet, his subsequent policies and actions will be even more worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Hitoshi Ashida was born in Kyoto and is 61 years old this year. After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, he entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and worked in Europe for about 20 years. He obtained a doctorate in law with his thesis "Research on the Tatar Strait." Later, because he was determined to become a politician, he resigned as a diplomat and joined the Seiyukai in his hometown as a candidate for councillor. Until last year, he was elected as a councillor six times. He is famous in the Japanese literary world as the president of "The Japan Times" and the chief writer of "Hochi Shimbun," and is also a diplomatic commentator. He has written many works. When the Seiyukai had internal conflicts, he supported Hatoyama; when the Liberal Party was established, he was the left wing of the party and did not cooperate much with Shigeru Yoshida. When the Progressive Party was transformed into the Democratic Party, Inukai Ken, Narahashi Wataru, and Ishiguro Jūzo were about to be purged. He managed to become the first president of the Democratic Party, and placed the right-wing commander Kijuro Shidehara in the position of honorary president. Last year, Shidehara was attacked and removed from office, and Saito Takao was appointed as the honorary president. Ashida's bloodless revolution monopolized the power of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is not a progressive political party, and it owns a small number of financial groups and landlords with feudal atmosphere, but he vigorously defended the corrected constitutionalism and pretended to be progressive liberalism; Ashida once swore allegiance to the army during the war. During the Japanese invasion of China, he presided over the Hochi Shimbun and promoted the "Conquest of China" theory. He was known as a "critic who kills with a single word." His political enemies were preparing to propose a purge after the war. He was able to use his nimble methods to prevent the purge from happening. Before the Japanese peace treaty was signed, he actually made wild remarks in his position as Foreign Minister, demanding the return of Ryukyu Chidori, which caused an uproar in the political world. As a result, Katayama rescued him and the Allied Forces indulged him. From the perspective of Ashida's experience, environment, and actions, he is completely a politician with plans, talents, and the ability to be opportunistic and flexible. He does not have Katayama's simplicity and purity. Today, he is full of ambition and is taking the stage in full costume, which will inevitably take Japanese politics a step back and be reactionary. His political foundation is an old-fashioned Japan. It can be asserted that he may brazenly revive Japanese militarism.</p>
<p>We are unwilling to make too many speculations about the personnel arrangements and policies of the Oita Cabinet. What needs to be pointed out here is that the Ashida Cabinet is the inheritance of the Katayama Cabinet, and its foundation is still fragile; however, what is different from Katayama is that he can tolerate the left and right wings of the Socialist Party for his own use, thereby using the left wing of the Socialist Party as his political foundation. The left wing of the Socialist Party has ideals and ambitions, as well as political desires. They may become the tail of Ashida, embellishing the unprogressive and conservative cabinet. However, Ashida's "black market transactions" with the left wing cannot be maintained for long. Due to the oppression of the conservative forces of the Liberal Party and the opposition within the Democratic Party, Ashida may sacrifice the left wing in order to preserve his own vested political interests. These possibilities and inevitable facts illustrate the conservatism and reaction of the Ashida Cabinet.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that Shigeru Yoshida's conservative forces are increasingly rising in the political arena, which can be explained by the large number of Liberal Party satellites and the fact that the House of Representatives nomination vote was only 36 votes apart. The Ashida Cabinet is the inheritance of the Katayama Cabinet, but she is the extension of the Shidehara Yoshida Cabinet. Therefore, the conclusion of our observation of the Japanese political situation is that Japanese politics has taken a step back from today. If Ashida falls, Yoshida will inevitably inherit the future situation. Japanese politics is taking steps back, becoming increasingly conservative, and finally returning to its former appearance, which is becoming increasingly distant from the democratization and progress of Japanese politics that we desire. We view Ashida's taking the stage in full costume in this way, and we do not have deep importance and expectations for its development.</p>

<h3>Cash Loans and Real Goods Collection and Purchase: The Farmers Bank Formulates Measures</h3>

(4) The standard for real goods collection for cash loans and real goods collection will be at least one-third of the total loan amount, converted into physical objects at the market price at the time of the loan, and recovered at the time of maturity. The remaining two-thirds and all interest will still be recovered in cash. In the past, it was planned to handle physical object loans as much as possible in the real goods collection area, and the measures will be determined separately.</p>

<h3>Victory in the War of Resistance and the Restoration of Taiwan Should Be Attributed to the Three Principles of the People: Vice Chairman Sun's Address to All Circles in Tainan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tainan 22nd] Vice Chairman Sun Ke addressed all circles in Tainan at the City Government Auditorium at 2:00 pm today, saying: Taiwan was ceded to Japan and was not restored until the victory of the War of Resistance and the surrender of Japan. This is actually due to the enemy resistance and sacrifices of tens of millions of compatriots in the country and patriotic people in Taiwan. For fifty years, the compatriots in the country have never forgotten Taiwan for a day. We should attribute our victory and restoration of Taiwan to the Three Principles of the People, that is, the most suitable doctrine for saving the country. Among them, nationalism advocates that the country belongs to the entire nation and must not allow foreign oppression. National sovereignty belongs to all people. The principle of democracy is to implement national politics. People should have rights, interests, and obligations, and cannot be monopolized by a few ambitious people. The principle of people's livelihood is to implement civil affairs so that everyone can live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, the Three Principles of the People generate power. The Founding Father used it to call on the whole country and overthrow the Manchus. Later, Chairman Chiang led the Northern Expedition to unify the country, and the July 7th War of Resistance defeated Japan. All of this was inspired by the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and we have a wise leader, Chairman Chiang, who leads the country, and we will be able to defeat Japanese imperialism. Japan is an island country, and the country is short-sighted and lacks political leaders with a long-term vision, so it has embarked on the road to failure. After the peace treaty is signed in the future, it will never be allowed to have any military legacy, so that the reading martial arts doctrine of the past will not rise again. Looking back at our country, we have a bright future. In the future, all compatriots in the country must be confident that all difficulties can be overcome, and the communist bandits' rebellion can be quelled within two or three years. As for the peace treaty issue with Japan, any peace treaty that has not been agreed to by China can absolutely not be established. In the future, striving for true peace is even more difficult than winning the war, but we firmly believe that this difficulty can be overcome, and the status of the Republic of China in the world will definitely be improved. Finally, I hope that all compatriots in the country will consistently believe in the Three Principles of the People, trust the government, support the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, work together with one heart and one mind, and jointly build the country and revitalize the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Our Immigration to the United States: Two Key Items Agreed Upon by Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 23rd] Regarding immigration matters to the United States, there are different views between China and the United States. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has repeatedly asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the US government. It is now learned that the key points recently agreed upon are as follows: (1) The US government believes that immigration to the United States by people from all countries is an internal affair of the United States and has the right to review it. The immigration passport issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be included in the immigration quota only after it has been signed by the US. (2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously notified the US Embassy in China that any passports issued by the Ministry with the word "Emigrant" noted should be included in the immigration quota calculation. Those who hold other general passports to the United States will not be counted within the quota immigration, and the US Embassy has agreed. As for the Chinese wives and children of American Chinese soldiers brought back to the United States from China, if they have not been issued immigration passports by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they should not be regarded as quota immigrants. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent another letter to the US Embassy.</p>
<h3>We Again Request the Philippine Authorities to Allow Overseas Chinese Stall Vendors to Resume Business: Minister Chen Zhiping Submitted a Note Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Manila 23rd] Our Minister to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, submitted another note to Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino today, again requesting that the overseas Chinese stall vendors who were expelled from the Manila Public Market on January 25 be allowed to resume business. It is believed that the note pointed out that before the ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines was handed down, the overseas Chinese stall vendors in the market had been forcibly expelled. The ruling of the Supreme Court proved that the Manila local court was indeed determined to oppose Chinese nationals, and this behavior was sufficient to prove that there is currently an anti-Chinese trend in the Philippines. The note explained that before January 25, there were 351 vacant stalls, and the Philippine authorities expelled the overseas Chinese stall vendors before filling the vacancies. This point is not in line with the main goal of the Philippine Public Market Act, which gives Filipinos "priority" rights. The note further explained that among the seven major markets in Manila, there are 9,449 stalls, of which only 453 are occupied by overseas Chinese, accounting for 5%, and there are currently 507 stalls that are not being operated by anyone. Minister Chen will meet with President Roxas tomorrow morning to discuss the market stall incident and other outstanding issues related to Sino-Philippine relations. Chen was originally scheduled to meet with Roxas today, but it was delayed by one day due to certain reasons.</p>

<h3>Hou Jingyuan Marries Colleague's Wife; Enemies Meet on a Narrow Path and He is Shot Dead</h3>
<p>A Crime of Passion Occurs in the Pingdong An Market</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 23rd Dispatch] Hou Jingyuan, the chief of the Fushun Coal Mine's mining police, was shot dead by his wife's ex-husband. Hou's wife, Yang Muhua, a graduate of Peiman High School, is 27 years old. Her father is a famous professor of political science. Yang first married Hu Zhongping, and they had a son and a daughter. When Hu was the head of the Transportation Section at the Fushun Mine, his wife had an affair with the chief of the mining police, Hou Jingyuan, and finally divorced Hu in September of last year to marry Hou. Hu later resigned and returned to Beiping. Because the children were still being raised by Hu, there was still contact [between him and Yang]. The day before yesterday, Hu and his wife came to Beiping. At 9 PM last night, when the two of them were going from the Beijing Hotel to the An Market, they encountered Hu Zhongping, the ex-husband. The three of them walked and talked. Hu repeatedly said to Hou: "You married my wife, we must have a duel." As they walked to the west gate of the market, Hu suddenly shot Hou in the head.

<h3>Northeastern Elders' Appeal - Continued from Page 1</h3>
<p>People from the Northeast in Beiping and Tianjin Provide Six Points of Opinion</p>
<p>(1) For the past two years, the Northeast has been undergoing massive destruction every day. The countryside is bankrupt, and industry and mining are destroyed. There is no national economy or people's livelihood to speak of. In terms of administration, the agencies are huge and powerful, and the military and civilians are at odds. Social order is trending towards chaos, and the area under its jurisdiction is shrinking day by day. The entire Northeastern people are trapped in a terrible situation from which they are powerless to extricate themselves. We must loudly appeal to the government to thoroughly reform.</p>
<p>(2) The most urgent problem to be solved is the lack of food. More than one-fifth of the 2 million people in Shenyang are filling their stomachs with soybean cakes and soybean residue every day. In addition, refugees from the surrounding countryside are continuously fleeing into the city. If transportation is not smooth, the entire city's people will be without food. In the current situation, only scattered lines remain, and the amount of currency in circulation is already in the trillions. The price of counterfeit money during the enemy's occupation was equal to that of the Taiwan currency. After the recovery, the exchange rate between the Taiwan currency and the legal tender went from a ratio of one to thirty to a ratio of one to over one hundred. However, the Northeast has always maintained a ratio of one to ten and prohibits the export of legal tender. There is only an exchange rate, not a ratio. Relatively speaking, the difference is tenfold. We must ask the central government to remedy this and take emergency measures.</p>
<p>(3) The current military situation in the Northeast has reached a critical stage. The current focus is on how to take effective aid to support it. Existing strongholds must be maintained, and efforts must be made to increase strength and effective disposition.</p>
<p>(4) The Northeast problem is not just a matter of local interests and losses. It is a problem for the entire country. If the Northeast is abandoned, the forces against the government will increase dramatically. Hundreds of thousands or even millions of troops will immediately attack Rehe and Chahar. The existing forces in North China will definitely not be able to resist. If North China is not secured, the enemy will gather the manpower and resources of the Northeast and North China, drive south, and the area south of the Yangtze River will also be indefensible. Today, consolidating North China means protecting the South. Striving for the Northeast also means maintaining North China. We must appeal to the people of the whole country to face the reality of the Northeast and have a common understanding. If the entire situation in China is controlled by power and violence, Annam, Burma, India, and various parts of Nanyang will also be affected in the same way, and the peace of the entire world will be threatened. Therefore, the Northeast problem is also a problem for the world.</p>
<p>(5) In order to support the Northeast and maintain the existing situation, we should give priority to opening up the traffic route between Jinzhou and Shenyang. It is also necessary to immediately concentrate and enhance the military force in North China in order to be able to respond effectively at close range.</p>
<p>(6) If the manpower and material resources of the Northeast are used well, it can become a great force for stabilizing China. Unfortunately, it is forced to be used by others and turned into a group of violence. This is the most distressing thing. The youth of the Northeast have experienced many changes and are mostly patriotic. The desire to defend their homeland is the strongest. If the central government can have appropriate measures, I believe it can take on the responsibility of defending the country. We believe that the timing is critical and the situation is serious. Appealing for the Northeast is also appealing for the entire country. We also hope to promote the righteous assistance of peace-loving people around the world.</p>
<p>Zhang added a personal supplement, saying: Today's Northeast problem is no longer a question of abandoning or not abandoning it. If the government has a solution, the gains and losses of the war are not worth mentioning. Today's problem is actually a question of whether it can be let go or not. Once you let go, others will take it away. If the Northeast is lost, North China will definitely not be secured within one to three months. This is how everyone in the Northeast and North China views it, including the military officials in charge. We are here to hope that everyone will have a deep understanding of the importance of the Northeast. This is also the common hope of the people of the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Current Northeast Problem Affects the Entire World</p>
<p>Wang Depu, the executive director of the Nanjing Northeastern Fellow Townsmen Association, then delivered a speech. He said in brief: The Northeast problem may be viewed differently by people in the Northeast, people in North China, and people along the Nanjing-Shanghai line. However, after talking with Ma and others and fellow townsmen's associations in various places last night, the opinions on the Northeast have become consistent. The whole country and even the whole world have the same understanding of the importance of the Northeast, and the urgent plan for the Northeast is how to defend the Northeast and maintain the existing broken points and lines. If sacrificing the Northeast can benefit the whole country and the world, then we are willing to sacrifice the Northeast. However, the gains and losses of the Northeast are now the key to the peace and tranquility of our country and the entire world. Therefore, we must do our best to defend the Northeast. Han Junjie, the chairman of Heilongjiang Province, then reported on the recent situation in the Northeast, saying: The crisis in the Northeast has reached its final moment today. Many people see that the Northeast is not secure. I have always been optimistic and not so pessimistic about the Northeast problem. However, if there are no effective measures to take, then of course I am pessimistic. In recent years, the measures in the Northeast have been chaotic. The first mistake was in believing in diplomacy, the second mistake was in economic measures, and the third mistake was in peace talks. In addition to these major mistakes, there were many small mistakes in administration and personnel, which led to the current mess in the Northeast. Everyone is responsible for this. There is no need to go into detail now. In the future, we must strive to win back the lost Northeast. If there are any more mistakes, it will definitely be lost. As for the economic problem, the number of circulation coupons issued is alarming, and the area of circulation is only a few incomplete counties and villages. How can prices not rise? The Northeast needs materials, but transportation is difficult, and transportation costs are a problem, resulting in a shortage of food and daily necessities, which increases the burden on the people and affects the military. Therefore, if we want the military to develop, the economic problem must be solved first. As for the military problem, Han said that when Chief Commander Chen raised the issue, Han suggested that the focus of bandit suppression must be placed in the Northeast. The Northeast is the screen of China. If the banditry in the Northeast is suppressed, the banditry within the pass will also be resolved. A Northeastern proverb says, "Close the door and beat the blind man." How can he not be eliminated? Finally, Han hoped that the Beijing and Shanghai press would mobilize public opinion and attract international attention. If the Northeast is not secure, the whole world will change because of it. The United States thinks that Europe comes first, but this view is too simple. The Soviet Union attaches importance to Asia because Europe has restrictions, while Asia has unlimited manpower and material resources. Once Asia falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, the whole world will be threatened. The current government must make a decision. Civil servants in the Northeast must not retreat and must fight forward with all their strength to defend the Northeast. At present, the manpower and material resources of the Northeast are still not a problem and can be fought for. Therefore, the military needs to be planned in a unified manner, and a sufficient military force must be used to eliminate the communist bandits in one fell swoop. Last spring, only one more army was needed, and last summer, only two more armies were needed to adequately eliminate the communist bandits. Therefore, we cannot deal with the communist bandits on a small scale. If we operate on a small scale, we will only be consumed by the communist bandits little by little. As for the administrative and economic measures in the interior, they cannot be promoted in the same way in the Northeast at present. The Northeast must simplify administration and concentrate its forces on bandit suppression and military affairs.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuanfu and Han Junjie Answer Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Shi Bingyan, the director of the Shanghai Northeastern Fellow Townsmen Association, said. There are only a few simple words: I hope the military and the people will not be separated.</p>
<p>The reporters then raised several questions and asked Zhang Yuanfu and Han Junjie to answer them. Regarding the specific food panic and the lack of military strength, Zhang replied: If transportation is resolved, there will be no problem with food, and military strength depends on bullets and manpower. It is not a problem to train 50,000 to 100,000 men in North China. The shortage is bullets. Therefore, under the circumstances of limited strength, we must concentrate our efforts on effective places. Han also provided facts to answer the food panic problem, saying: As far as he knows, Huludao currently has food transported from various places, which is enough for the citizens of Shenyang and nearby troops for three months. However, due to transportation problems, it cannot be transported there. Therefore, if the military situation is slightly opened up and the transportation line can be maintained, there will be no problem with food. Zhang also answered a reporter's question about Zhang Xueliang's return to politics, saying: The people of the Northeast have not considered this point. The people of the Northeast obey the government's orders. No matter what measures the government takes, the people of the Northeast are willing to obey.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang Yuanfu summarized three points: (1) I hope everyone will publicize more and call on the people of the whole country to pay attention to the Northeast. (2) The strength of North China must be enhanced. North China can have trained manpower to supplement the Northeast. This is the most effective method. (3) If the Northeast is abandoned, an organization will inevitably appear. What kind of organization this is and its impact on world peace can also be imagined by everyone.</p>

<h3>London Conference Opened Yesterday; Three Countries Discuss Various Issues Concerning West Germany; Details of the Conference are Temporarily Not Released</h3>
<p>[United Press London 23rd Dispatch] A conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France opened here today to discuss the German economic issues that have been unresolved since the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference last year.

Although it has not been officially announced, it is believed that the three countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg will participate in the conference at least partially. Due to the instability of the French political situation, the three countries decided that the conference would be held in secret.</p>
<p>American sources here said: Although U.S. dollars must be used to avoid the redization of the French occupation zone, Washington does not want to "threaten" France to participate in the three-zone agreement. The United States believes that the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries do not need to participate in the three-zone negotiations, because this is purely an administrative issue of the three occupation zones. However, the United States firmly believes that without the participation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries, no other problems can be solved.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 22nd Dispatch] Responsible diplomatic officials claimed that the United States will act to place West Germany in a leading position in accordance with the Marshall Plan at the Three-Nation Conference. The United Kingdom and France are willing to cooperate, but on the condition of strictly guaranteeing the prevention of the re-emergence of German military power. This security issue will be discussed first. The United Kingdom has therefore suggested that a political and military alliance be concluded with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and other teams of countries. Although the four countries of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have expressed their agreement in principle on this, they believe that it is necessary to ensure that all countries can cooperate in the future to prevent aggression from any direction. In order to meet this requirement, the United Kingdom has agreed to allow the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to provide opinions on the West German Conference, but only limited to the general policy issues of West Germany, and not to the management issues. There are three general policy issues: (1) Rebuilding German industry. How should this industry, which is very easy to turn into military production, be prevented? (2) International co-management of the Ruhr coal and iron zone. Regarding this point, France requires international co-management, the United Kingdom advocates taking a certain state-owned approach, and the United States advocates taking a free enterprise system. (3) The German political system adopts a centralized system, or, as France suggested, organizes a federation, implements local decentralization, and has no military unity. The attitude of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on this has a great relationship with the future of West Germany. This matter may be clear tomorrow. All countries take security guarantees as a prerequisite, and France obviously has a bad attitude. French Foreign Minister Pichon said that security must be guaranteed first, and then France will allow its occupation zone to merge with the British and American occupation zones.</p>

<h3>Preventing Holy Land War: Britain Considers New Plan</h3>
<p>Jewish Council Condemns British Attitude</p>
<p>[United Press Lebanon, 23rd] Reliable sources claim that Britain has proposed a plan to avoid war in Palestine. Arab Supreme Commander Kay Huijia has already agreed to halt the full-scale offensive. However, the terms of this "peace proposal" have not been disclosed.

<h3>Completion of the Election of Japan's New Prime Minister: Ashida Actively Forming a New Cabinet; Cabinet Member List Largely Drafted</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 23rd] The process of Ashida's election as Japan's new prime minister was completed on the 23rd. Ashida plans to pay a courtesy visit to General MacArthur. Ashida will begin actively forming the cabinet on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] The Rules Committees of both houses have decided to convene and pass a motion to adjourn parliament for 20 days, allowing Ashida to form a cabinet during this period and draft legislation to be submitted to parliament.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] The work of forming Ashida's new cabinet in Japan began today, but apart from formal visits to the leaders of various parties, there were no other talks. Formal negotiations will have to wait for future meetings of representatives from the Democratic, Socialist, and Cooperative parties. Currently, there is still disagreement between the Democratic and Socialist parties regarding the number of cabinet positions allocated. The Democratic Party advocates: Democratic Party 8, Socialist Party 7, Cooperative Party 2. The Socialist Party argues that the allocation should be proportional to the number of seats held by each party in the House of Representatives, which would be: Socialist Party 8, Democratic Party 7, Cooperative Party 2. Although there is only a one-seat difference between the two parties, it is generally believed that this issue will be difficult to compromise. According to sources from Ashida's cabinet formation headquarters, the list of Ashida's cabinet members has been largely drafted, but it still awaits final decisions with the Socialist and Cooperative parties. For the Democratic Party members entering the cabinet, in addition to Ashida concurrently serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs as the Prime Minister, there are: Sadakichi Ichimatsu (reappointed), Kozaemon Kimura (undecided), Takeo Kurisu (reappointed), Tokutaro Kitamura (Home Affairs, or Commerce and Industry, or Agriculture and Forestry), Giichi Takeda (Communications), Gisaburo Tomabechi (Chief Cabinet Secretary), Heitaro Inaba or Yoshio Sakurai (Minister of State) (seven to be selected from nine); Those hoped to be entered into cabinet from Socialist Party include: Tetsu Katayama or Suehiro Nishio (appointed as Foreign Minister with the qualification of Deputy Prime Minister), Chozo Mizutani (Home Affairs or Commerce and Industry), Tatsuo Morito (reappointed), Yuyuu Suzuki (reappointed), Kanju Kato (Labor or Home Affairs), with the remaining one or two positions to be selected from Kazuo Nagae, Eiji Tomikichi, or Ushiro Ito. As for Masaru Nomizo, he will not be invited to join the cabinet because he did not vote for Ashida in the Prime Ministerial nomination vote. Those from the Cooperative Party hoped to enter cabinet are Takeo Miki or Kyoji Funada, and Seiichi Okada. If Miki does not enter the cabinet, then Funada and Okada will enter the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Liberal Party Decides Not to Participate in the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] Following a meeting of the party's top executives yesterday, Liberal Party President Yoshida convened a general meeting of staff, resolving the following: (1) Reject participation in Ashida's coalition cabinet, and a statement will be issued after a general meeting of affiliated members tomorrow; (2) Work on the new party will continue actively. To ensure the smooth progress of this work, it has been decided to first dissolve the Liberal Party, with the hope of successfully forming the new party by the end of February. As for the name of the new party, it will be jointly negotiated by representatives from all factions participating in the new organization, but the name "Democratic Liberal Party" may be adopted. The policy of the new party is currently being drafted by the Liberal Party side, and it will be completed within a day or two, and will be jointly decided by all factions in the future.</p>
<h3>Our Side Accuses Itagaki of Directing Puppet Show</h3>
<p>Induced Wang Jingwei and Puyi to Form Puppet Governments</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] Our prosecutor, Xiang Zhexun, accused war criminal Seishiro Itagaki in the International Military Tribunal today, holding him fully responsible for Wang Jingwei's escape from Chongqing in 1939 and Puyi's secret departure from Tianjin in 1932 after the Shenyang Incident. Xiang stated: "Puppet organizations" were Itagaki's favorite strategy to carry out his conspiracy of economic exploitation and political control of Northeast China and other regions. Xiang claimed that Itagaki had ordered Wang Jingwei to assume the position of head of the "Nanjing Puppet Government" under the guise of "peace," and before that, he had induced him to form a puppet government in the name of independence to assume the position of puppet in the "Manchukuo Puppet Government."</p>
<h3>Prague Teeming with Armed Police: Communists Plotting to Seize Power; Benes Still Intends to Try to Form a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Prague, 23rd] The Communist Party launched a three-pronged offensive on the 23rd to seize power in Czechoslovakia. The Communist Party has armed the police in Prague, occupied the headquarters of the National Socialist Party, and prohibited Czech citizens from traveling abroad. Police carrying new weapons appeared on the streets on the morning of the 23rd, as the Communist Party's attempt to seize power through peaceful means in parliament has failed due to President Benes's refusal.</p>
<p>The above three measures were all ordered to be implemented by Communist Interior Minister Nosek. He also ordered the arrest of Urazin, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Slovak Democratic Party, who resigned at the end of last year and was accused of treason. It is generally believed that the ban on foreign travel and the police's accusation against Urazin are part of the Communist Prime Minister, Gottwald's, plan to seize complete control of the government, hoping to establish an "Iron Curtain"-style "police state." Communist trade union leaders support Gottwald's call for factories to hold a one-hour general strike on the 24th, threatening to paralyze the entire country with a general strike if their demands are not met. The Communist Party's strike appeal includes demands to change the constitution according to the Communist line and complete the nationalization of various industries. It is believed that this is an action to help Gottwald fight against President Benes.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Prague, 23rd] After returning to Prague yesterday afternoon, Czech President Benes held talks with various political figures, but no official information has been released on this matter. However, according to a political figure, the Communists do not oppose the formation of a new cabinet including all parties and factions. However, in order to enhance their position in the cabinet so that they do not constantly rely on the support of the Social Democratic Party, it is rumored that the Communist Party is trying to include representatives from trade unions and other large national organizations that obey Communist orders in the new cabinet. The same source also said that although the Communist Party does not oppose members of the Catholic Party rejoining the cabinet, they will refuse to cooperate with the Socialist National Party. It is rumored that Communist Prime Minister Gottwald will select the leader who can ultimately participate in the cabinet from the Socialist National Party to join the cabinet.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Commemorates Red Army Day; Land Forces Commander Urges Soldiers to Prepare for War Tirelessly</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 22nd] Moscow Radio broadcast the message to the soldiers delivered by Soviet Minister of Military Affairs Marshal Bulganin on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, stating that as long as imperialism exists, the Soviet Union itself is at risk of being attacked at any time. The soldiers of the Soviet Army must be ready at all times, sparing no cost and under any conditions, to protect the honor and interests of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, after the Bolshevik Party and the leaders of the Soviet people, Lenin and Stalin, achieved the greatest victory of the social revolution, the Soviet Army and Navy were established. The Soviet government resolutely implements its peace-loving foreign policy, as the vanguard of progressive forces, striving for reasonable and lasting peace and international security. Stalin's just policy is deeply supported by the people's democracies and all friends of peace and freedom around the world. The Soviet army is tasked with defending this policy. In the post-war period, the Soviet army has continued to achieve success in military and political training, but it must not become complacent as a result. The Soviet army must never abandon any effort to fulfill its current obligations. Marshal Bulganin also ordered that on the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Army, thirty salvoes of artillery be fired in Moscow, the capitals of the Soviet republics, and several other cities. Fireworks were set off in Moscow at night, and theaters staged plays related to the Red Army.</p>

<h3>Hull's Memoirs (X) (3)</h3>
<p>— North American Newspaper Alliance Copyright All Rights Reserved; Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Office</p>
<p>Subordinates Cannot Cooperate With Superiors</p>
<p>In August 1943, before President Roosevelt set off for Quebec, he asked Welles to resign from his position as Undersecretary of State. He called Welles into his office in the White House and explained this to him.</p>
<p>In the previous few weeks, the President and I had talked about Welles's problem more than once. We agreed that Welles should resign and be sent abroad to take on a special mission, responsible for the new work related to this mission.</p>
<p>I am unwilling to describe in detail some of the problems caused by Undersecretary of State Welles, as there is no point in doing so. These problems have been increasing for two or three years. The Rio de Janeiro Conference in January 1942 showed an attitude of his, which was not new to me - that he was always prepared to make important decisions without consulting me.</p>
<p>From the beginning of our relationship, I always tried to give him reasonable freedom to carry out his work. I often told him to go directly to the President, especially when I was too busy in the State Department, and told him to handle matters with the President that he was handling. This was in line with my policy, which was that colleagues close to me, the Undersecretary of State, counselors, and Assistant Secretaries of State should go to the President themselves to handle various special matters, as long as I knew about it. I felt that this occasional contact could give them more experience, greater hope, and a deeper interest in their work, and could reduce some of my heavy burden, a burden that weighed heavily on the shoulders of the Secretary of State, especially during these difficult times we were experiencing.</p>
<p>But I found that Welles abused this privilege, sometimes going to the President without my knowledge, or even trying to get a decision without my knowledge. Part of the reason for this tendency may have been because Mr. Roosevelt and Welles were old friends in terms of family relationships, and had similar backgrounds in terms of society and school.</p>
<p>During a period when the war in Europe was increasingly heading towards an outbreak, the official business in the State Department piled up higher month by month, so I approved Welles to receive many or most of the ambassadors and ministers who wished to visit the State Department. Of course, I always tried to meet all the diplomatic representatives who wanted to see me, and I always kept in touch with them on important matters. In addition, for important matters, Welles should bring foreign representatives to me, or tell them to come and see me themselves.</p>
<p>In the end, I soon discovered that he did not do so in many cases, although I had made it clear that I must meet these representatives in such cases, no matter how busy I was. Later, when an important ambassador looked at me at my request and I wanted him to come again to continue the discussion, he immediately raised his hands and said that I should talk to Mr. Welles first. This situation gradually but constantly deepened.</p>
<p>I began to notice that Welles was conducting private correspondence with our diplomats and other government officials, which should normally be handled through the official channels of the State Department. He often sent them personal notes, asking them to give personal replies, while in fact this matter should be handled normally with the State Department's notes. The bad effect of this method was that he took many negotiation or discussion items into his own hands, while this matter should normally allow me and the directly relevant officials of the State Department to better understand its general situation.</p>
<p>In the late spring of 1942, Welles gave two speeches on diplomatic issues, which tended to put our government on a new path in foreign policy. The more important one was given at Arlington Cemetery Memorial Day, discussing our post-war plans, at which time Foreign Minister Molotov was visiting the United States. In these two speeches, Welles did not consult with me in advance about his new ideas.</p>
<p>On June 20, 1942, I called Welles into my office and pointed out to him that no Undersecretary of State or Assistant Secretary of State had ever had the authority to propose any degree of new foreign policy, and that such authority does not exist now. I cannot allow the attempt to have the Secretary of State and the Undersecretary of State coordinate their work as two leaders, or to have the Undersecretary of State solely responsible for this task.</p>
<p>I also said that according to the clearly defined rules of the State Department, no Undersecretary of State or Assistant Secretary of State can go directly to the President for any official business, unless the President is concerned, or the Secretary of State knows and permits it. No one knows this point more clearly than Welles himself. I said that my granting him unprecedented rights to go to the White House may have been a mistake on my part, because as far as I know, none of his predecessors had ever had this privilege.</p>
<p>Welles replied that he did not know that he had expounded on new foreign policy in his speech. Then he said that, in view of what I had said, he would completely stop giving speeches in the future.</p>
<p>I replied that his speeches were wonderful, and I hoped that he would even give a hundred speeches to support the war; the only thing I had in mind was that the issue of new foreign policy should be avoided in his speeches, unless we had agreed on it beforehand.</p>
<p>What surprised me was that Welles, until the end of the conversation, still confused two completely different speeches and insisted that he would not give any more speeches in the future. Another thing that surprised me was that he said that in one of his conversations with the President, the latter had said that he himself did not want to give any speeches on post-war issues, but that it would be fine for other people in the government to give a few as trial balloons.</p>
<p>I replied that Welles had not told me that he had held this conversation with the President, and moreover, this was fundamentally inconsistent with his initial argument that he had not felt that new foreign policy had been mentioned.</p>
<p>Our conversation had the effect of clearing the air for the time being. Later, Welles still gave speeches on diplomatic issues, but he consulted with me in advance. But he did not stop going directly to the President over my head. I did not have the same faith in him as I did in my other colleagues.</p>
<p>I felt that regardless of Welles's education and training in diplomacy, his views on certain important issues and policies were narrower and less sound than those of my other colleagues. Before the outbreak of war in Europe, we had different opinions on armed intervention in Cuba and on the assessment of the results of the Munich Conference. After the outbreak of the war, we had different opinions on the neutrality zone in the Western Hemisphere and on the proposed Aide-Mémoire to Japan, which Roosevelt and Churchill had agreed on at the Atlantic Conference, and Welles was an advisor during its drafting. I felt that this document might have led to war with Japan at that time, when we were not as prepared as we were when the Pearl Harbor incident occurred. After the Pearl Harbor incident, we had conflicting opinions on how to deal with Argentina at the Rio de Janeiro Conference, the nature of his speech, and the organization of post-war international security institutions.</p>
<p>These differences of opinion were sometimes due to differences in thought, and sometimes due to differences in opinion on the more practical and effective methods of dealing with major issues, not to mention that Welles was often unwilling to cooperate with me. This situation was particularly acute in the second half of his service in the State Department, and was quite detrimental to those of us who worked together.</p>
<p>For several years, I had hoped that Welles would supervise the administrative work of the State Department in the most effective way possible, which is the normal task of the Undersecretary of State, so that the Secretary of State could devote more time to policy formulation. But Welles seemed to be greatly distracted by other matters, and as a result, those who could express opinions in the State Department were deeply disappointed with the results of his handling of administrative work. After Stettinius took over as Undersecretary of State, I instructed him to completely reorganize the administrative work of the State Department.</p>
<p>The President himself also began to experience the extent of Welles's disloyalty to me. He was particularly dissatisfied with Welles's Arlington Cemetery speech, complaining more than once because he had not consulted with either of us beforehand. He told me that he had later advised Welles on this speech. On one occasion, he told me that Welles had made a suggestion to him, requesting that he be sent to take on a prescribed mission, but the President did not mention what the nature of this mission was. Mr. Roosevelt severely criticized Welles for not having consulted with me before making this suggestion.</p>
<p>I could have gone to the President to resolve the Welles issue and insisted that he make a choice between Welles and me. But I have always been in the habit of cooperating with people, not of opposing them. The work of the State Department is now very complex, and Welles is a hard worker, and if he could serve on a basis of loyalty, I would rather use him than discard him.</p>
<p>But in the early summer of 1943, the President himself found that this situation in the State Department could not continue. He himself decided that, given the current circumstances—details need not be given—the effectiveness of the State Department could be improved by Welles's resignation. He and I agreed that Welles's dismissal should be made easier for him, that is, by the President expressing his willingness to send him to South America or the Soviet Union in the capacity of traveling ambassador to take on a special mission.</p>
<p>When the President asked him to resign, he made this suggestion to Welles, pointing out to him that he could therefore leave the State Department without causing unnecessary speculation.</p>
<p>Welles did not give the President a definite answer to this suggestion. Immediately after talking with Mr. Roosevelt, he came to my office. He expressed his belief that the President's actions were due to my intentions. I told him the whole truth, including that the President had acted after his own deep consideration, regardless of whether his actions were the result of any suggestions from me.</p>
<p>So I urged him to accept the President's suggestion to take on a special mission, especially mentioning a conference in Moscow. Welles immediately replied in a firm tone that such a trip would not be fruitful. He soon stood up, went to my desk, shook hands with me, and then left. Since then, I have not spoken to him.</p>
<p>I soon went to attend the Quebec Conference. Welles went to Burma. He did not accept the President's suggestion to take on a special mission, and wrote a letter of resignation, which he mailed from Burma to the White House.</p>
<h3>Opening Address by the Speaker of the City Council: Promoting and Urging the Suppression of Rebellion and Implementation of Constitutionalism; Citizens Should Jointly Be Responsible for Maintaining Local Security; Stabilizing People's Livelihoods is the Top Priority for Municipal Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The first session of the fifth assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council was grandly opened at 9:30 yesterday morning in the council's auditorium on Tanggu Road, with 163 councilors in attendance. In addition to the mayor and directors of various municipal bureaus, Yan Zhuang, Jiangsu Provincial Commissioner, Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court, and Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Garrison District, also participated.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began with an opening address by Speaker Pan, which was filled with solemn warnings. Subsequently, Mayor Wu and Councilor Fei Shusheng, representing the councilors, delivered speeches.</p>
<p>The first meeting began at around 10:00 a.m. The Secretary-General gave a report, and after discussing the agenda, Mayor Wu reported on the administration's policies. No meeting was held in the afternoon. The second meeting will be held from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. today, followed by work reports from the Directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Affairs Bureaus. Councilors will then raise questions to the respective bureaus, to which the directors will respond.</p>
<p>In his opening address, Speaker Pan said: "Today, our council is holding its fifth meeting, coinciding with the beginning of the spring of the 37th year [of the Republic of China]. As the saying goes, 'The year's plan starts in spring.' I believe none of our colleagues fail to feel an added sense of responsibility. I, Gongzhan, humbly serving as Speaker, would first like to share my personal feelings for your consideration.</p>
<p>In terms of the national situation, this year is the year for the nation to implement constitutionalism and should also be the year to correct disorder and return to order. Chairman Chiang instructed us: 'The suppression of rebellion and the implementation of constitutionalism are two sides of the same coin in nation-building. Suppressing rebellion can remove obstacles to constitutional government, while implementing constitutionalism can establish confidence in democracy.' As the representative body of public opinion in China's largest city, this council should take the lead in establishing a model for democratic politics in our city, while also fulfilling its responsibilities to directly and indirectly encourage citizens, urge the government, and dedicate ourselves to suppressing rebellion to remove obstacles to constitutional government. However, whether it is constitutionalism or suppressing rebellion, the people's most basic requirements are survival and livelihood. People in war-torn areas already feel threatened for survival, while people in the rear areas also feel threatened for their livelihoods. Therefore, in plain terms, the minimum condition people currently hope for is simply 'peace and prosperity.' But how can people live in peace and prosperity? Recently, U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart Leiden, said: 'There are many selfless people in China. If they can effectively unite to promote the will of the people, they can assist the government and benefit the country.' He also said: 'China now has a constitution to determine the framework of the country. If the people can contribute their efforts under the constitution, they can assist the government in completing the modernization of the democratic system.' As the representative body of public opinion in this city, and as the representatives of the citizens, our council bears the responsibility of promoting the will of the people, and should also effectively unite selflessly. As the constitution begins to be implemented today, we should express the true will of the people to the government, so that the government can respect the true will of the people at all times and in all places, using it as a guideline for its policies. Then, I dare believe that not only can peace and prosperity be guaranteed, but the severe crisis facing the nation can also be averted. U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall has repeatedly said: 'The main solution to China's problems largely requires the efforts of the Chinese themselves.' We share the same sentiment. What he means by 'Chinese themselves' of course refers not only to officials of the Chinese government, but includes each and every one of us. Mr. Gu Yanwu has a famous saying: 'Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation.' Today's situation has truly reached a critical juncture for the survival of the nation. Every citizen has a responsibility and should stand up and take responsibility. Moreover, Shanghai is China's largest international city, and we, the colleagues of this council, are the representatives of the citizens of this largest city. We must at least have some suggestions and contributions regarding the minimum hope of the citizens for peace and prosperity. Furthermore, regarding how the nation's political system can better broaden avenues for speech, recruit talent, advocate the rule of law, and practice democracy to achieve the purpose of correcting disorder and returning to order, we should not limit ourselves to local affairs and underestimate ourselves, but should raise our voices and actively move forward, shouldering the responsibility of planning and urging. Shanghai is no ordinary place. The words and actions of Shanghai citizens are watched and listened to by the whole country, and are greatly related to order and chaos. This is something that the colleagues of this council cannot but hold with diligent self-exhortation.</p>
<h3>Organizing Local Armed Forces to Protect Lives and Property</h3>
<p>Regarding the security of this city, it seems that society has been somewhat turbulent in the past month. At the end of last month and the beginning of this month, within five days, there were three incidents of varying degrees of disruption to order: students insulting the mayor, dancers destroying the Social Affairs Bureau, and workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory occupying the factory and resisting military police. Fortunately, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu, and Police Bureau Director Yu and other responsible officials responded effectively and handled the situation properly, which was able to eliminate the disasters and prevent them from expanding. The communist bandit Ding Xishan's group also harassed the outskirts of the city, but due to the close cooperation and mobile encirclement by the army and local teams of neighboring counties under the command of Commander Xuan, they were quickly wiped out. For the sake of the security of the entire city, the colleagues of this council cannot but first express our deep appreciation to the local officials. However, maintaining local security and rectifying order, under today's circumstances, should not rely solely on the government, but should be the shared responsibility of the people. How can we make the basic self-governing Baojia organizations in this city more valued by the government and more rigorously organized and trained to assist in investigation and prevention of wrongdoing? How can we, in accordance with central government laws and regulations, urgently raise funds and organize local self-defense forces to assist the national army in defending our homes, use local tax revenue to support local militias, and use local militias to protect local lives and property? This has become an extremely urgent matter today. Only in this way can we contain bandits, protect local areas, and contribute to suppressing rebellion. The colleagues of this council, witnessing the danger of the times and the turmoil of society, cannot but rise up quickly, mobilize the people, and assist the government in completing its task of maintaining security.</p>
<h3>Applying a Focus-Based Approach to Future Municipal Construction</h3>
<p>Regarding municipal construction, at a time when prices are high and the treasury is stretched thin, it seems that all construction must adopt a focus-based approach. Otherwise, if we try to do everything and want to handle everything, the result will be that everything is abandoned and nothing is accomplished. If this premise is not mistaken, then I, Gongzhan, believe that when the council examines the municipal government's budget, colleagues should abandon their own local perspectives and plan for the entire city. We should appropriately measure what should be done first, what should be delayed, what should be done by the city, and what can be done by the districts. Where should the focus of this year's municipal administration be placed? It still awaits the proposal of the municipal government and the discussion of our colleagues, but there is no doubt that there must be a central focus. In my humble opinion, no matter what kind of construction the government undertakes, it should first strive to stabilize people's livelihoods. At this time and in this place, everything should prioritize stability, seeking progress and prosperity only after stability. People in times of war only ask to make a living in a stable environment! Only with stability can we talk about construction; only with stability can we talk about democracy. Therefore, any good facilities or any appealing measures, if they do not help stabilize people's livelihoods, or if they hinder social stability, or even if they can potentially sow seeds of chaos and create social unrest, then regardless of the central or local government, for the sake of the overall situation, it would be better to temporarily postpone them in this city. We must avoid aiming too high and pursuing novelty. Before things are even started, the people are already suffering from their harshness. The saying that the ancients often cited as a warning, "A harsh government is fiercer than a tiger," is precisely what this means!</p>
<h3>People Have No Extravagant Expectations at This Time, But Only Ask to Eliminate the Threat to Their Livelihoods</h3>
<p>Secondly, the people have no extravagant expectations at this time, but only ask that the government can passively reduce some of the threats to their livelihoods, which would be sufficient. For example, food and other daily necessities can gradually be distributed fairly and selflessly; rent standards can be adjusted to be more reasonable; and the municipal government can gradually provide some affordable public housing, so that citizens with low incomes do not have to worry about not being able to pay rent; rugged and muddy roads can be slightly leveled; accumulated and dirty garbage can be gradually cleaned up; public transportation can appropriately increase the number of trips without constantly raising prices; in places where people often drink dirty water, there can be some public taps with running water for drinking; remote suburbs can have public telephones to meet urgent needs; electricity can be automatically saved as much as possible, without alarming fines, or without frequent power outages affecting production; more public central primary schools can be established, so that parents do not feel hopeless and unable to send their children to school because they cannot afford to pay tuition. All those who violate the law should be fairly punished by the law, so that innocent citizens do not suffer extrajudicial persecution and lose their due freedoms and rights; tax collection can be effectively rectified to eliminate embezzlement, without having to focus solely on raising tax rates... Things like these, in a basic modern country and modern city, are what people feel are urgently needed and have the right to demand. As long as the government can carefully observe the people's hidden needs, and earnestly do its best within its capabilities, I believe that even without much construction to boast about, it will certainly gain the sincere support and cooperation of the colleagues of this council and the citizens of the entire city. The colleagues of this council, being in the position of representatives of the citizens, cannot but express the expectations of the people, appeal to alleviate the suffering of the people, and are extremely willing to cooperate with the government to improve the situation.</p>
<h3>With Rights Come Obligations: Pay National Taxes and Serve in the Military</h3>
<p>Finally, I, Gongzhan, would like to frankly tell all my fellow citizens that our citizens have rights, but they also have obligations. Ambassador Stuart said: "The only hope for China and other countries to achieve democracy lies in its people recognizing their rights and obligations." This is truly a golden and precious saying. We have our basic freedoms and rights to the local and national level in the Constitution, which are stipulated in Chapter II, but at the same time, we also have the obligation to pay taxes and serve in the military. If we want to be masters of the country and masters of the city, then we must pay national taxes and local taxes, without evading taxes. This is the true meaning of contributing money. We must serve in the military, enlisting when we reach the age and taking responsibility personally. This is the true meaning of contributing effort. As for national laws, they are the track for maintaining social order and public interests, and everyone should abide by them. Needless to say, we expect government officials to be servants of democratic politics, and we must even more supervise our own responsibilities as masters of democratic politics. This council was established during the period of political tutelage and has lasted for a year and a half. Now it has entered the constitutional stage. Soon, after the promulgation of the Municipal Self-Government Law based on the Constitution, this city will have a municipal assembly organization. Therefore, the colleagues of this council, no matter where they come from regionally, professionally, or from which party, should lead by example and establish a good foundation for local democratic politics for the future elected municipal assembly. We are extremely willing to learn from the style of parliaments in advanced democratic countries, and can argue fiercely for a case until our faces turn red in order to make the voting as perfect as possible, but we will never hold grudges for the failure to win a case. We will devote ourselves wholeheartedly, work together harmoniously, seek only the welfare of the majority of citizens, and focus only on cultivating the atmosphere of local democratic politics. This is what we especially hope our fellow citizens of the entire city will constantly supervise, teach, and correct. We would be extremely honored."</p>

<h3>The Mayor Hopes the Council's Instructions Will Provide Concrete Guidelines; Fei Shusheng Urges the Implementation of Resolutions</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech that this fifth session of the first Shanghai Municipal Council includes councilors from both the Minshe [Chinese Democratic Socialist Party] and Qingnian [Chinese Youth Party] parties, and the meeting is even more expanded. At the first meeting, I said that I hoped for "unity between the government and the council." For nearly two years, we have truly achieved "unity between the government and the council." The municipal government has made every effort to implement the cases passed by your council. If there are those that have not been implemented, it is truly due to difficulties in reality. I have heard the Speaker's speech five times, and today's speech is the most painful and touching. This year is the year when the country and the local area are moving towards the light, so it is also the most painful and difficult year. Everyone knows that "the darkest time is before dawn," so we feel the Speaker's instructions are even more important. What are the minimum requirements of the citizens? I hope the council can provide concrete guidelines so that the municipal government can proceed according to these guidelines, and the council can supervise it every day, so that the light can come sooner.</p>
<p>Councilor Fei Shusheng, representing the councilors, replied, saying that although the results of the council's four sessions have been praised by the outside world, some citizens have criticized them as "only speaking for themselves." We should humbly accept the citizens' criticisms and make necessary reviews and improvements. What the council hopes from the municipal government is: (1) When the municipal government submits proposals for discussion, it should conduct detailed research and careful consideration, so as not to pass them hastily in the council and then cause the citizens to complain after they are implemented. (2) All issues should be submitted to the council for discussion before implementation, and the council should not be treated as a mere decoration for implementing democratic politics. (3) It is hoped that the cases already resolved by the council in the past will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Humiliated by Gambling, the Youth Vandalizes and Reports the Case; Gunfire Erupts in the Central Market; Young Street Vendor Seriously Wounded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 10:40 a.m. yesterday, a shooting occurred at the intersection of Sichuan South Road and Central Road. The injured person, Fang Qiaosheng, 20 years old, from Hefei, resides at No. 61 Nanlinli, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. He is a used goods vendor who sets up a stall in the Central Market on Sichuan Road, selling surplus U.S. military supplies. At the end of the lunar year, Fang went to gamble on Pai Gow at the upstairs of the Meili Food Company behind the Datong Bank nearby. The dealer at the time was a bodyguard of an important National Government official, named Li Dasheng (26 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 22 Panyu Road, Shanghai West). The two suddenly had a dispute due to gambling. At that time, Fang's fellow vendors rallied to help Fang, causing Li to be humiliated and leave in anger. He harbored resentment and secretly plotted revenge. Later, Fang found out about Li's background and dared not set up a stall for half a month. Yesterday morning, at around 10:00 a.m., he secretly came out to set up a stall. After Li received the news, he came with three friends by car, two in military uniforms and two in plain clothes. They went to the Central Market and confronted Fang Qiaosheng, demanding justice. After a disagreement, one of them stepped forward, grabbed Fang's collar, and punched him wildly. The others then surrounded and beat him. At this time, the market was in chaos. Fang's fellow vendors were numerous, but they did not dare to help because the other party was military. Fang was beaten and injured, shouting for help. Fearing that the street police would come, the soldier pulled out a pistol and fired a shot, hitting Fang's right hand, penetrating his palm, and then penetrating from his right abdomen to his right thigh. Blood flowed non-stop, and he fell to the ground. The murderers scattered. At that time, a friend of Fang's stepped forward to defend him and followed them out to chase them. A beautiful American girl, Huai Xi, witnessed everything and also bravely assisted. At the same time, nearby patrol police and patrol police chief No. 4616, No. 1156, police officers No. 2177, No. 2282, police officer No. 2342 and many others joined the encirclement. As a result, the main suspect, Li Dasheng, was arrested and taken to the Huangpu Police Bureau for interrogation. The injured person was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The bullet has been removed by the doctor. It is reported that the injury is serious and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Advance Purchase of Third-Class Train Tickets Begins Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to facilitate the travel of government agencies, organizations, schools, and public educators by train, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has already implemented a reservation system for second-class passenger tickets on all trains. However, third-class tickets have not been processed at the same time. It has now been decided that starting today, all public educators from various government agencies and schools, as well as staff members of formal organizations, can present an official letter or service certificate to the travel service offices set up by the Railway Bureau in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places two days before their departure to purchase third-class train tickets in advance.</p>
<h3>A Strange Guest Appears at the General Assembly; Petitions of Grievances Pour In</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] During yesterday's meeting of the Municipal Council, an elderly man, 53 years old, named Shi Chenglie, from Wuxing, who works as a clerk at the Shutongshou Chinese Medicine Shop, suddenly came and claimed to be a councilor. He sat in a councilor's seat to participate in the meeting and even printed cards with the title of Municipal Councilor. The council staff felt very surprised and asked him for proof. He took out a ballot from the original election of councilors. This old man actually took it as an election certificate. According to him, he is very enthusiastic about attending council meetings. Friends all said that today is a meeting and recommended him to attend, so he came specifically to participate. The staff knew that he had been fooled and advised him to leave.</p>
<p>As prices rise, the travel expenses for councilors have also increased, to 140,000 yuan per person per day, for a total of ten days.</p>
<p>The seat number one for the councilors is for Councilor He Pinheng of the Minshe Party.</p>
<p>As the conference opened, petitioners poured in. Yesterday, more than a hundred refugees from northern Jiangsu and unemployed workers petitioned again for the issuance of suburban licenses for the tricycles they had made, holding paper flags and lining up opposite the gate. When they saw the mayor come out, they shouted loudly. Also, Wu Guocai, the owner of a small transportation company at No. 138 Dongda Famous Road, was asked by plainclothes police officers from Yulin Road to provide bribes on the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month. Because he did not pay, he was falsely accused of theft and taken away, along with four other shop employees. So far, there has been no news. Therefore, more than twenty members of his family, men, women, old, and young, led by Wu's brother, held flags and burned incense to the council to kneel and beg for justice.</p>
<p>When the mayor reported on the student unrest at Tongji University, he mentioned that they had a slogan that said: "Executioner Xuan Tiewu, Old Fox Wu Guozhen."</p>
<p>Councilors continued to submit proposals, totaling more than fifty to date.</p>
<h3>Mayor Reports on Administration, Presents Two Major Problems, Full Rationing Relies on Assistance and Supervision, Strengthen Baojia Organization, Do Not Believe Rumors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, Mayor Wu presented a detailed report with charts distributed to each senator at the Senate meeting. He also verbally explained the three most important points for each of the nine bureaus of the municipal government. He specifically pointed out two major problems currently concerning the entire city for senators' reference. These two major problems are: (1) the problem of livelihood; the distribution of rice will be implemented within three months. The United States has indicated that it will only provide further assistance if the implementation results are good, so this effort must be perfect. Therefore, it is hoped that every citizen should understand their obligations and rights, and city senators, district heads, and district representatives are requested to assist and supervise so that no malpractices occur. (3) The problem of security (i.e., the problem of survival); according to the Tongji student unrest on January 29, the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau by the dance industry on January 31, the Shenxin labor unrest on February 2, and the landing of Ding Xishan on February 8, it can be proved that this is a planned struggle by the communist bandits. They regard Shanghai as a large center for concentrated disruption. If their conspiracy succeeds, just imagine what Shanghai will become! Fortunately, the military and police worked hard to eliminate the disaster, which must be attributed to Commander Xuan. However, we can imagine that the communist responsible persons will be blamed by their superiors for the failure and will continue to disrupt. Therefore, the city must pay attention to two things: (1) Strengthen the Baojia organization, (2) Do not believe rumors. The communist bandits spread all kinds of rumors by any means. For example, this time, I was beaten, and rumors said that I was knocked down by the cavalry, which is completely untrue. It was also said that more than 400 Tongji students died in this case, which is "God knows what"! Currently, some so-called student associations for poor students are making unreasonable demands, which are obviously with ulterior motives. Ninety-nine and nine-tenths percent of the workers are good people, so don't be incited by a few bad elements.</p>
<p>Improve Conscription, Increase Police</p>
<p>Regarding the administration of each bureau: (1) Civil Affairs: Handling military service is more important. Shanghai's first military service, with 3,000 quotas all filled, can also be regarded as self-consolation, but there are also shortcomings, such as family allowances and job assignments that have not been completely satisfactory. This year's military service will be further expanded, so it is decided to improve the methods as much as possible. The city's military service conference will be held on the 29th of this month, and the results will be reported at the general meeting.</p>
<p>(2) Police Affairs: It is most difficult to maintain traffic order in the city, but in recent months, traffic police have made considerable progress in performing their duties, and their spirit of maintaining local security is admirable. Strengthening local forces is a major issue in the future. There are a total of 12,000 police officers in Shanghai, which was determined the year before last. At that time, the population was more than 3 million, but now it is nearly 5 million, and the number of police officers has not increased. Especially in the current environment, it is necessary to strengthen them, so it is planned to add one security team, but the funding is not a problem.</p>
<p>Commodity Prices and Disaster Relief Are Most Difficult to Handle</p>
<p>(3) Social Affairs: The Social Affairs Bureau has been working hard for two months to handle the year-end bonus cases, and the high commodity prices make it most difficult to deal with. At 8:30 this morning, I was still discussing rice supply matters with Director Wu and grain merchants. The price of rice in Shanghai is 1.98 million, while the price of rice in Wuxi has reached 2.16 million, resulting in a situation where the price of rice in the producing area is higher than here. Grain merchants feel that they are losing money. If the municipal government wants to raise the price of rice, it will affect the citizens. If it wants to release all the rice, the source will become a problem. This kind of difficulty is "hard to express in words." After three households are allocated rice, it will be of great help, and other items can also be distributed successively. In addition, winter relief work has also been the most difficult thing in the past three months. There are more than 300,000 refugees who have fled to Shanghai, and the fundraising target is 60 billion, but the actual amount received is only more than 20 billion. There is a misunderstanding among the citizens about the charity sale of houses, which should be explained: (1) The houses sold for charity are different from the public housing in Dabuqiao. They are all made of high-quality materials. The current market price of Grade A houses is worth 2.4 billion, and Grade B houses are worth 1.6 billion. (2) The lottery is guaranteed to be absolutely fair and will be held publicly. In addition, the equipment in the third shelter is poor, which is due to the fact that it was originally a reception center for unemployed workers, and the conversion time was short. It has been improved as much as possible in the past two weeks. The establishment of shelters has reduced theft and has achieved a good effect.</p>
<p>(4) Education: (1) The tuition fee issue, the established standard is indeed to take into account the interests of both parents and schools, and it is hoped that citizens can understand. (2) Handling student aid funds, thanks to the enthusiasm of all sectors, 15 billion yuan has been received. However, some student associations have requested 76 billion yuan for scholarship fundraising and also requested tuition fee reductions and salary increases for faculty and staff. This kind of statement is completely irresponsible and contradictory, and there must be a conspiracy. It is not easy to raise 15 billion, where to raise 76 billion.</p>
<p>Cutting Staff and Simplifying Administration Is Difficult</p>
<p>(5) Finance: The handling situation is in accordance with the meaning of the City Council, but recently the Central Government has ordered to increase certain tax revenues, and we have to ask the Council to discuss it. In fact, the rate of increase in commodity prices is very different from the increase in tax revenue. The city government's staff reduction and simplification of administration has been implemented since I took office, but the current situation is difficult. For example, the number of police officers is not enough. (6) Public Works: The Nanshi Wharf has been completely rebuilt within a year, and the Hengfeng Bridge will also be open by the end of March. The biggest problem is dredging the Suzhou River. At the end of the lunar year, rice was not available for two or three days, which was extremely anxious. Later, the police were sent to assist and found that the 15-mile area above Xin泾 has become a one-way waterway, and ships are blocked and cannot pass. This is because the enemy and puppet governments have not dredged it in the past eight or nine years. According to the current commodity prices, it costs 80 billion yuan to dredge every year, and it takes three years to complete. The city government plans to take a part of the 120 billion yuan in customs import duties every year for this purpose, and it can start this year. (7) Public Utilities: When I took office, the city's power generation capacity was 100,000 kilowatts, and now it has increased to more than 200,000 kilowatts. If the City Council can pass the joint power plant case, it can be further improved in the future. The US aid to China loan has also agreed to provide 14 million US dollars for the plant. The purpose of saving electricity is to ensure that the electricity used for production is sufficient and will not be interrupted. The city government does not want to impose fines, but hopes to save. After review, it can save 7,000 kilowatts after saving. Although the amount is not large, if it is not restricted, the amount of waste will be alarming. The saving method may be cancelled or changed during the summer time. It is not possible to increase the price of public utilities. In order to avoid excessive price increases, the city government specially invited personnel from various agencies to jointly review. If the price is not increased, the government must subsidize, and if it is not subsidized, the only option is to close the door.</p>
<p>Rental Standards Submitted for Consideration</p>
<p>(8) Land Administration: Aerial surveys have been completed and can be used. The clearing of civilian land occupied by the enemy and puppets should thank the efforts of the City Council. The Central Government has sent personnel to handle it together. Regarding the issue of rental standards, I believe that there should be a standard, because landlords feel that they are losing money now. After the house price is low, no one is willing to build houses. This standard must also take into account all aspects. This case is requested by the City Council to carefully consider a solution.</p>
<p>(9) Health: When Mayor Wu mentioned health, he praised Director Zhang as a model civil servant, saying that he had no housing when he took office, and now the city government has found a place to live for him. I also know that Director Zhang usually has debts, and the travel expenses for this leave to return to his hometown are also being raised. He has made great contributions to handling health. The reason why garbage is piled up in many places in the city is also because the Suzhou River is silted up, and ships are not easy to export, resulting in slow transportation. This year's epidemic prevention work will pay special attention, and it is expected that its severity will be greater than in previous years.</p>

<h3>Opposing the Calculation of Housing Index</h3>
<p>Tenants on Nanjing Road Entertain the Press</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The directors and supervisors of the Nanjing Road Business Association and the representatives of the tenants of the houses in the Nanjing Road area of the British Jardine Matheson Company, previously opposed the calculation of rent based on the cost of living index, and entertained people from all walks of life a few days ago to explain their attitude. In order to promote the attention of tenants in the city and make another appeal, the association yesterday entertained the press at the Dadong Restaurant, supplementing several points of opposition reasons, and at the same time will ask the City Council to consider the interests of the majority of citizens and seriously discuss this issue.</p>
<h3>The Mayor and Others Negotiate with Various Industries to Assist in Accelerating the Sale of Charity House Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Charity house lottery tickets for winter relief, 22 billion were sold in advance, and 14 billion were sold after the official tickets were issued. 70% of the Grade B tickets have been sold, and 30% of the Grade A tickets. Now the Grade B tickets are scheduled to be drawn on March 1. The association, in order to speed up sales due to the short time, yesterday specially hosted representatives from various industries at the International Hotel by Mayor Wu, Du Yuesheng, and Xu Jilu to discuss how to assist various industries in accelerating sales. According to the mayor, even if the charity lottery tickets cannot be sold out, there is no need to worry, because the houses built are solid and beautiful, and the current market value is more than double the cost. However, it is hoped that all of them can be sold out before the lottery draw to increase the chances of citizens winning prizes. In addition, in order to make all sectors understand the actual situation of the construction of charity houses, the association specially invited the press to visit the construction site of charity houses at 1503 Zhongzheng West Road at 11:00 am today.</p>
<h3>Supervisor Xu Jugeng of the Supervisory Office Went to the Hemin Prison for Inspection Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the incident of prisoners in Shanghai Prison secretly accusing the prison authorities, Xu Jugeng of the Jiangsu Supervisory Office went to inspect yesterday, and went to the Hemin Prison, which is called the "Pavilion of Wind and Waves," for inspection. He believed that adding the title of "Pavilion of Wind and Waves" was too much. Xu Jugeng also brought back a pinch of prison food as proof. Han Shuzhi, a judge of the High Court, and He Huimin, a prosecutor of the District Procuratorate, also went to inspect the interior of Shanghai Prison yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Wuxi Silk Industry Association Came to Shanghai to Petition Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd] The silk factories pushed the chairman of the industry association, Gao Jingyue, to go to Shanghai tomorrow to meet with representatives from Zhejiang and Shanghai to petition the Silk Association to adjust the final price method of the raw silk loan in the 36th year.</p>
<h3>The Civil and Criminal Divisions of the High Court Moved to a New Location to Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Civil Division of the High Court on North Zhejiang Road and the Criminal Division of the High Court on Tilanqiao have moved to 66 Anguo Road to work since yesterday. The interior has not been completely repaired. Currently, only one court is available. After the repairs are completed, there will be three criminal courts and three civil courts. The new location of the High Court is a magnificent building with three floors. The first floor is for receiving and sending, cashier, general affairs, general affairs, lawyer rest, parties and witness waiting rooms, and courtrooms. The second floor is for the president's office, the chief clerk's office, meeting rooms, and courtrooms. The third floor is for the judge's office. Because the new location has not been completely repaired, one court in the Tilanqiao Special Criminal Court is still in use to avoid affecting the trial work.</p>
<h3>Cases of Government Agencies Using Civilian Land, Land Determined to Be Returned Will Be Returned First, Second Resolution of the Review Committee on Civilian Land Occupied</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Review Committee on the Use of Civilian Land Occupied by Enemy and Puppet Organizations in Shanghai by Central Government Agencies of the Executive Yuan held its second meeting yesterday and resolved: (1) To formulate two methods for determining the standard for payment of land occupied by the enemy and puppet organizations to be returned: (A) For land forcibly requisitioned by enemy and puppet organizations, which has been reviewed and returned by this committee, the original owners shall be allowed to pay the land price according to the standard land price set by the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau in the 34th year, and redeem the land. However, if the land price was not fully paid when the enemy and puppet organizations requisitioned the land, the payment shall be made according to the percentage of the price received at that time. (B) Poor small farmers who are indeed unable to pay the fee may be exempted from paying the fee and redeeming the land after being certified by the local district office and approved by the city government. (2) For cases of government agencies using civilian land, the parts that have been reviewed by the small groups and have been decided to be returned by the relevant user agencies will be returned first. For parts that are difficult to return, the usage plan will be submitted to the meeting within a time limit. (3) The Shanghai Experimental Economic Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will return a total of 9.964.744 acres of land in the farm. Among them, civilian land is 6.485.44 acres, enemy property is 1.394.450 acres, public land is 349.740 acres, and property to be investigated is 1.735.110 acres.</p>
<h3>The National Grain Federation Cables to Request Permanent Exemption from Grain Business Tax, Election of Directors and Supervisors Postponed to This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Grain Federation held a group review meeting at 10:00 am yesterday, divided into three groups: General Affairs, Business, and Economy for review, and adjourned at about 12:00 noon. In the afternoon, a plenary session was held, attended by Yu Simin of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ye Shifu of the Ministry of Food, Ji Mingzhai of the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 40 representatives of the association, chaired by Wang Zhupu and Cai Wangshu. The motions reviewed by each group were discussed and passed. As a result, 6 motions from the General Affairs Group, 14 motions from the Business Group, and 13 motions from the Economic Group were merged for discussion. One item from each group was reserved. The election of directors and supervisors will be postponed to 1:00 pm today. After the directors and supervisors are elected, the oath-taking ceremony will be held, and the first meeting of the board of directors will be held.</p>
<p>Among the proposals passed yesterday, the more important ones are two: First, the proposal to cable the Central Government to permanently exempt grain business tax. Second, the proposal to petition the government to allow free flow of grain and protect legitimate grain transportation in order to benefit military and civilian food needs and adjust resources.</p>
<h3>The Manager and Customers of Baokang Silver Shop Were Arrested One After Another for Buying and Selling Gold</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau received a report yesterday and seized a case of buying and selling black market gold at Baokang Silver Shop at 702 Xinzha Road, seizing about 30 taels of gold, including 3 gold bars weighing 5 taels, 18 bars weighing 1 tael, 2 gold pounds, and transaction ledgers for gold ornaments.

The case is being investigated in detail by the section.</p>
<h3>Jiguang Steamer Is Undamaged, Loading Cargo and Sailing to Tianjin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Beiyang Line Jiguang Steamer, which docked at the Jinliyuan pontoon in the Jiangmian area of ​​the 16th Wharf last Saturday, had more than 1,300 bags of sugar loaded for unloading. Unexpectedly, smoke suddenly appeared in the head cabin at about 7:00 pm. The Jianghai Customs sent a wheel to extinguish the fire. As a result, only one square foot of hemp skin was burned. However, after the cabin was flooded, the water accumulated more than two feet, and some of the sugar was dissolved in water. Fortunately, the hull of the ship was not damaged at all. The tide-affected sugar has been removed, and loading continues. It will sail to Tianjin on schedule tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Quantity and Price of Sugar Distribution Will Be Redetermined Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city's registered sugar was originally distributed at a rate of one catty per person per month. The Resources Committee recently compared it with the fact that Taiwan distributes only half a catty per person per month, believing that the treatment seemed unfair. When Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau went to Beijing this time, he discussed this issue with the Resources Committee. According to Director Wu yesterday, this can be decided when the sugar group of the city's price evaluation committee holds a routine meeting tomorrow. If half a catty is redistributed, then one year will be divided into six periods, and one catty will be distributed in each period. The distribution price will also be redetermined at that time.</p>
<h3>The Industrial and Commercial Crisis Is Like Tangled Hair, Zhao Banfu Talks About Taking Office, Hoping for Labor and Capital to Cooperate Openly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The newly appointed Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Banfu, officially took office and went to the bureau to work yesterday. Among those who went to congratulate him were Yan Huiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Cha Liangjian, and people from the industrial and commercial sectors and heads of workers. Deputy Director Zhao told reporters that he felt quite heavy when he took office in the current situation where the serious situation of industry and commerce is becoming increasingly serious. The current industrial and commercial crisis is like a handful of tangled hair. He personally believes that the key to saving the Chinese industrial crisis should start with the cotton textile industry. The number of cotton textile workers is as high as 100,000, and it is related to the machinery, dyeing, and weaving industries, so it is hoped that all relevant parties will work together to solve the difficulties of the industry. In the past, the Social Affairs Bureau advocated calculating wages based on the cost of living index, which played a major role in stabilizing the city's labor force. Former Deputy Director Li made the greatest efforts in this regard. Looking ahead to the industrial and commercial situation this year, it is feared that serious layoff problems will occur. It is hoped that labor and capital will truly cooperate and be open and honest to overcome this difficulty.</p>
<h3>Nine Suspects Indicted for Murder in the Case of Zhang Xi'an Being Stabbed to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Xi'an, from Zhangjiayan, Huai'an, was kidnapped into a car in Shanghai on December 14 last year and driven to the south of the Huangxing Road Bridge. Zhang was stabbed to death with an ox-ear knife. After the police bureau arrested the suspects and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation, Prosecutor Fang Zheng indicted the defendants Ma Hongsheng, Zhang Shaoyun, Liu Desan, Sun Xiong, Li Tongcai, Ma Qishi, Li Xueke, Li Bingzhen, and Li Chongxi for the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<h3>Comedian Yang Xiaofeng Was Implicated in a Guarantee and Detained for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Comedian Yang Xiaofeng, who is singing "Who Doesn't Want to Earn Money" at the Jinguo Theater, was implicated yesterday for guaranteeing the merchant Zhang Wei. Zhang was accused of fraud and breach of trust by the glass merchant Zhu Fengyi. Yang was also implicated as the guarantor. The District Court summoned Yang three times and he failed to appear. He was detained for interrogation at 4:00 pm yesterday. Yang claimed that he was not very clear about the details of the case and was purely taking the blame for others. Finally, the judge ordered him to pay a written guarantee of 30 million yuan pending summons. Although Yang Xiaofeng was on trial, he still did not lose his humorous nature. He told reporters: "I have never been sued before. This time I am taking the blame for others. I came to the court to see what it is like. If possible, I will prepare a Geng song to sing about the experience of being sued in the future."</p>
<h3>A Special Court Will Be Established, He Chongshan Resolutely Declines to Be the President</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city's special court will be established soon. The position of president was originally to be filled by He Chongshan, who was appointed by the Ministry of Justice. He was originally the president of the Higher Court of Songjiang Province in Northeast China and has come to Shanghai. However, he told reporters yesterday that after receiving the notice from the Ministry of Justice, he immediately resigned to Minister Xie. He is still firmly resigning. It has not been decided whether he will take up the new position.</p>
<h3>Murder in the Public Pit, Old Man Strangled to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the public pit of a grass shed without a number next to the electric wire wood at Yakai 16 on the side of the railway at the intersection of Chuan Highway and Xinguang Road in Zhabei, there was an old man, Lu Fenglian, 54 years old, from Dongtai. His son, He Qing, is a tricycle driver and lives at 8 Rigao Lane, Jiaxing Road. Lu has a granddaughter named Yingdi, 10 years old, who used to live with Lu. After Yingdi fell asleep at about 10 pm the night before, she got up at 8 am the next morning and did not see her grandfather. Later, she found a person lying on the ground, already dead. She ran to tell her father, accompanied him back, and found that there was a rope around the neck of the body and scars on the left side. He hurriedly reported to the North Railway Station Police Branch. Section Chief Wang Shou ordered section member Chen Yixuan to lead the police to investigate. It was found that the window had been broken, and it was estimated that a thief had entered the house and strangled him after failing to steal. The suspect is now being hunted down.</p>
<h3>Rumors That the Haikang Steamer Was Mixed with Chinese Passengers Are Still Groundless</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Haikang Steamer departed from Shanghai for Japan for the second time on the 20th. In addition to carrying our country's military police to Japan, there were also 13 Japanese prisoners and 50 Japanese nationals. It was rumored that among the 50 Japanese nationals, there were 33 Chinese, including 26 Taiwanese. However, according to news from the China Merchants Bureau yesterday, the Japanese nationals were strictly inspected by the military police and constitution when they boarded the ship, so the above news was considered to be unfounded. The ship is expected to arrive in Yokohama today, and the Japanese prisoners and Japanese nationals will be strictly inspected upon landing.</p>

<h3>Discovery of Civilization Relics from Beneath the Gansu Strata</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 19th] The National Gansu Science and Education Hall is currently holding a Science and Education Exhibition from the 15th to the 21st of this month. It is divided into four sections: Physics and Chemistry, Natural History, Birds and Beasts, and Work in Progress Photographs. Among the nearly 3,000 exhibits, from the origin of life to the highest achievements of modern science, explanations are provided in a simple and accessible manner. This helps people understand that beneath the Gansu strata, not only are diverse resources buried – such as petroleum, coal, gypsum, mirabilite, etc. – but also incredibly ancient cultural relics – such as ancient pottery from 4,000 years ago, unearthed in the Tao River basin. The distribution and production of other flora and fauna, the structure and use of electro-education tools, the manufacturing and experimental methods of physical and chemical instruments, and the morphological specimens of birds and beasts, allow farmers who have come to the city for leisure during the Spring Festival to gain a clear understanding in half a day, receive a kind of scientific enlightenment, and correct the errors of legends in their minds. This is a cultural activity that is well worth promoting. On a long table in the Natural History room, more than ten fossilized bones of vertebrate animals are displayed. The types include three-toed horses, woolly rhinoceroses, saber-toothed tigers, turtles, etc. The pale color, rugged shapes, and unfamiliar names to modern people’s minds cause many to stare blankly in front of them. This is the result of more than three years of hard work by researcher Wang Yongyan of the hall, discovered in the remote Longjia Gully of Wudu. These fossilized bones were buried underground at least 500,000 years ago.</p>
<p>From "Human" to "Turtle"</p>
<p>Among these dozen or so fossils, the most sigh-inducing is the turtle shell fossil. Two years ago, it was cherished as a brilliant star in Chinese anthropology. At that time, everyone believed it was a skull fossil of "primitive man." It even had an unofficial scientific name: "Wudu Primitive Man." At the end of July of the 35th year, the reporter visited this skull of the old ancestor for the first time with a reverent mood. When Wang Yongyan took it out of the strictly guarded deep cabinet at the reporter's request for photography, his hands were simply shaking a little. Subsequently, newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai began to introduce this rare discovery. The International Propaganda Department of the Propaganda Department even translated one of the articles into English and published a booklet. In late August of the same year, Wang Xuwu of the Northwest Geological Survey first exposed this "primitive man" mystery, determining that it was a fossil of a turtle shell, which led Yang Zhongjian of the Nanjing Geological Survey to write an article, expressing a lot of emotion.</p>
<p>Now, this legendary fossil has been labeled as a "turtle" of a reptile, mixed among a group of unimportant beasts.</p>
<p>Mistakes Also Have Value</p>
<p>Since "Wudu Primitive Man" became "Turtle," many people in the community have given Wang Yongyan a lot of slander and ridicule. Some people even wrote "Sunday Essays" to criticize him in newspapers. What was Wang's reaction? – From these places, one can see the working attitude and confidence of a true scientist – he ignored these slanders. Last year, he went to Wudu for the fourth excavation. He saw that the fossil layer of Longjia Gully, and only he himself believed that there were countless mammalian fossilized bones in that place. Although its value cannot be said to be the best in the world, it is at least rare in the country.</p>
<p>One evening in early winter last year, the reporter went to the Gansu Science and Education Hall to interview Wang Yongyan. In Wang Yongyan's studio, he met him. He was hunching over his large pile of broken bones. When he caught sight of the reporter, he immediately straightened up, forgot the pleasantries, and began to talk endlessly about his fossils. "Look, the leg of an antelope, the lower jaw of a rhinoceros, the spine of a hyena, the horn of a reindeer, the tooth of an elephant, the lower jaw of a baboon..." – It was still the same old story, but the quantity was much more than the year before (the 35th year). When the reporter asked him how many pieces there were in total, he held up four fingers, "Four thousand pieces! Total weight, three and a half tons."</p>
<p>"You're winning by quantity," the reporter said with a smile.</p>
<p>"No," he said definitively, "Longjia Gully really has a lot. Instead of finding a few fragments to study and then sending them to authoritative scholars for identification, it's very uneconomical in terms of time and money. Therefore, it's better to excavate a large number of them and study, compare, and refer to them together. It's much easier and more accurate."</p>
<p>We talked about the "Wudu Primitive Man" incident. He said seriously, "I am not discouraged by people criticizing my mistakes, and I am not afraid of people's ridicule. I believe that people in the academic world and knowledgeable people in society will not do this. I'll tell you," he simply treated me as his student, "When a scientific expedition from England was working in South Africa, they mistakenly identified the joint bone of an elephant as the skull of a primitive man. Davison Black, an anatomical researcher of Peking Man, once identified the femur of a deer discovered in Shandong as the femur of an ape-man. Even the famous anthropologist Osborn mistakenly identified a molar of a cow discovered in America as the fossil tooth of an ancestor of beauty. All of this is not only not ridiculed by any scholars or experts in the world, but also became an important stage in the history of science – you know, a history of science is a history of scientific errors. Scientific research seeks truth, and any errors in the process are helpful to the discovery of truth and have their value because, after various errors, one can obtain the correct truth. A scientific researcher is not afraid of being laughed at for his mistakes, and at the same time, anyone with a little scientific knowledge will never laugh at him for his mistakes, especially since the 'Wudu Primitive Man' is just beginning to be studied, and the official report has not yet been published..."</p>
<p>Treasure Trove of Fossilized Bones</p>
<p>After visiting the Science and Education Exhibition, the reporter interviewed Wang Yongyan, asking him why only 271 of the fossilized bones were on display, and why the more precious items were not exhibited. Wang said, "First, the place is small, and second, this is for the general public to see, as long as the general public understands that there are these things under the Gansu strata." The reporter asked him to describe the process of discovery. He said, "Just as Mr. Pei Wenzhong said, in these days of frequent wars, who would pay attention to these geological and archaeological works that have little connection with actual life? If your newspaper truly respects academics and needs this kind of material, I do have a summary of a paper that I can give you to publish?" He took out a piece of paper from the drawer and handed it to the reporter, adding, "This is what I read at the annual meeting of the Lanzhou Branch of the Geological Society of China last year. The editor of 'Northwest Forum' (note: this journal will be published in a month) has already collected it and is preparing to compile and print a special issue. I don't care if there are copyright issues in the future." The last sentence was a joke. I began to silently read his summary of the first paper on the fossilized bones of Wudu:</p>
<p>Discovery of the Mammalian Fossil Layer in Wudu (Summary)</p>
<p>In the 34th year of the Republic of China, while working in southern Gansu, more than ten mammalian fossils, such as dogs, sheep, rhinoceroses, and deer, were discovered in the Shengdipo area of Longjia Gully, ninety li north of Wudu County. In the 35th year, with the financial assistance of the Ministry of Education, two excavations were carried out in Shengdipo, lasting more than three months in total. In the spring of the 36th year, with the assistance of the Ministry of Education again, two months of excavation work was carried out at the same place. A total of more than 4,000 fossils were obtained before and after. These fossils have already begun to be repaired, and detailed identification is pending after the repairs are completed.</p>
<p>The strata near the fossil site, from old to new, are as follows: (1) Silurian Period – blue-gray limestone and black phyllite exposed east of Gaojiacun, interspersed with low-quality coal seams; (2) Devonian Period – light gray-blue limestone containing Atrtpa at Tujiaoshan; (3) Carboniferous Period – gray-black, gray-yellow Carboniferous rock, widely exposed near Yewaisi; (4) Permian Period – lower gray-white thick-layered Maokou limestone, upper limestone conglomerate, yellow sandstone, black shale, and Longjiagou coal series mixed with coal seams. Above the coal series, there is gray-white thick-layered limestone, which may be the Maokou limestone thrust over the coal series. In the Shengdipo area, the Maokou Factory limestone is covered with very thick red beds, and the surface is eroded into soil. There are no profiles available for reference within two or thirty li nearby. Only on the west wall of the fossil excavation pit, a profile of five meters and eight long and two meters deep was excavated, with a dip of 20 degrees northward and a strike of 25 degrees west of north. The strata from bottom to top: A, light red, slightly yellowish dense clay layer, one meter thick; B, slightly redder and looser clay layer than A, five decimeters thick; C, same as A, eight decimeters thick; D, same as B, one meter thick; E, slightly gray-white hard sandy clay layer, four decimeters thick; F, same as B, five decimeters thick; G, same as E, four decimeters thick; H, same as B, more than one meter thick. Among them, the fossil-rich layers are B, C, and D. Furthermore, there are five small reverse faults on this small profile.</p>
<p>Since the fossils have not yet been completely repaired, it is not possible to know all the animals they contain at present. However, based on the observation of those that have been repaired, the vertebrate fossil layer in Wudu includes at least the following animals: A, Carnivora, including: leopard (Felidae), jackal (Hgaena), saber-toothed tiger (Machairodus), dog (Canidae), bear (Ursedae), etc.; B, Perissodactyla, including: Dicerorhinus, Chilotheriuns, Sinotherium, Hipparionn, Equus Sameniensis, etc.; C, Artiodadlyla, including: pig (Susidae), antelope (Antelope), etc.; Reptilia, including: turtle (Emydida), etc.; Primate, including: baboon (Gorilla).</p>
<p>In addition to the above fossils, in recent years I have also obtained more than ten fossils of water buffalo, saber-toothed elephants, rhinoceroses, deer, and sheep in the southern township of Xihe County and the northern township of Wudu County."</p>
<p>"Ah, a rich treasure trove of fossilized bones!" After the reporter finished reading Wang's summary of the paper, he couldn't help but exclaim softly.</p>
<p>Unfolding Future Activities</p>
<p>Next, the reporter asked Wang Yongyan about his future plans. He said, "I have now agreed with Mr. Yang Zhongjian of the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Central Geological Survey on the research method. The conditions are as follows: I will transport dozens of representative pieces of the repaired fossilized bones to Nanjing, where Mr. Yang will identify them. According to common practice, the transportation cost to Nanjing will be borne by the Gansu Science and Education Hall, and the transportation cost back will be borne by the Central Geological Survey. The copyright belongs to the Geological Society of China and will be compiled as one of the 'Palaeontologia Sinica'. Mr. Yang and I will jointly sign the publication. As for the cost of going to Nanjing for research and continuing the fifth excavation in Wudu this year, the Science and Education Hall has requested the Ministry of Education to allocate 400 million yuan. The official document was submitted to the Ministry of the Army in January of this year. Because of the approval of the education budget, it has not yet been allocated. However, based on my past requests for subsidies, I have always received special approval from Minister Zhu. Minister Zhu is a senior geologist and is very aware of the importance of this work. This time, there probably won't be any problems."</p>
<p>He also told the reporter that when Mr. Pei Wenzhong went to the Tao River basin for archaeological work in July and August last year, he also went to work with him for a period of time. In the days he spent with Mr. Pei, he realized that Mr. Pei was a very humble scholar. Regarding his excavation situation in Wudu, Yang Zhongjian, China's authority on paleontology, also mentioned the discovery of fossilized bones in Wudu in a journal of the American Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.</p>
<p>When we talked about the "Northwest Archaeological Working Team" being organized by Pei, Wang said that according to private information he had received, it was now shelved due to lack of funding. However, Mr. Pei Wenzhong will definitely come to Gansu again during the summer vacation this year to continue working.</p>
<p>About Wang Yongyan</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter will introduce Wang Yongyan, a young scientist from the Northwest. Wang is from Lanzhou City and is only 35 years old this year. In his early years, he studied aviation flight. Due to illness (color blindness), he went to Kyushu, Japan, to study geology at the Minjiu Institute of Technology, and also studied biological archaeology. After the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to the country and served his hometown. From the 27th to the 30th year, he served as an engineer in the Gansu Construction Department, engaged in the economic geological survey and research of Gansu Province. After the 30th year, he entered the National Gansu Science and Education Hall as a natural science researcher, and also served as the director of the promotion department, and still holds this position.</p>
<p>In these long ten years, the first three years were inseparable from "due to; hereby." Only in the 30th year did he begin his geological travel work. In that year, he investigated the geology of southeastern Gansu and southern Shaanxi, and wrote "The Geology and Minerals of Southeastern Gansu." In the 31st year, he investigated the geology of Hexi and wrote "Travel Notes on the Geology of Hexi." In the 32nd year, he investigated the geology of northeastern Gansu and Ningxia and wrote "The Geology of the Jizixia Coalfield" and "Survey Report on the Liujigou Glauber's Salt Mine in Ningxia." In the 33rd year, he investigated the geology of eastern Gansu and wrote "Preliminary Study of the Geology of Eastern Gansu." In the 34th year, he investigated the geology of southern Gansu and wrote "The Xigu Iron Mine." Then, he discovered the vertebrate fossil layer in Wudu, and he spent the remaining three years or so on the excavation, sorting, and research of fossils.</p>
<p>In addition to these geological survey works in the field, he also paid attention to the abundant resources of Gansu and wrote two books, one is "Salt in the Northwest" and the other is "Resources of Gansu." These works are indispensable reference materials for subsequent workers.</p>
<p>The reporter is unwilling to excessively praise this young scientific worker who is dedicated to his work, but only feels that he is admirable. He is a devout Christian, does not drink or smoke, and is always working with such vigor. We can imagine that in the highlands and wilderness of the Northwest, in the deep mountains rarely visited by people, under the scorching sun, in the storm, even the sudden downpour of rain and snow is difficult to find a place to shelter – unless it is under a mountain rock or in a kiln – in the environment, he carries his luggage, brings his instruments, walks alone, and observes carefully. Unless you have experienced it yourself, you will not know the joys and sorrows.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Murder of Xu Shouchang, Chairman of the Chinese Literature Department of National Taiwan University</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 23rd] The news that Xu Shouchang (Jifu), Chairman of the Chinese Literature Department of National Taiwan University, was suddenly assassinated around 3 a.m. on the 19th has been reported by our reporter via special telegram. Now, the details of the incident are described as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Shouchang was a famous scholar of sixty-six years old. He was a fellow villager of Chen Yi and Zhou Shuren, and a senior returnee from Japan. After Taiwan's restoration, he was recruited to Taiwan by Chief Executive Chen to serve as the director of the Provincial Compilation and Translation Hall. After the reorganization of the provincial government, the hall was abolished, and he took office as the chairman of the Chinese Literature Department of National Taiwan University. He was not only a diligent scholar, but also a kind and honest excellent mentor to young people. In the past two years, he has devoted himself to the writings of Taiwanese literature and history, and has worked hard to discover the relics of Dunhuang. He still lived the most austere literary life.</p>
<p>In his diary, from January 25th to February 16th, two things happened one after another. One was the theft of his salary at the school, and the other was the burglary of his residence. The old man believed in fate before his death, but in the end he could not escape the manipulation of fate. The third time he was killed. The circumstances of the murder were too tragic. The murderer climbed over the low wall, stabbed him four or five times in the neck, and once on the cheek. There was a pool of blood on the mat, and the room was in a mess. It happened around 3 a.m. It was not until dawn at 6:30 a.m. that his eldest daughter Shiwei (a sophomore at the College of Agriculture of National Taiwan University), who lived in another room, urged the two maidservants who were like children to see why the master, who was usually an early riser, was late. As a result, they found the old man, who was still alive last night, lying horizontally on the bamboo bed, with his neck bloody and the blood vessels not broken. Only then did the eldest daughter rush to inform her classmates and report to the police. The military, police, and court sent personnel to the scene for inspection. Reporters and friends also rushed to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Excerpts from several pages of the deceased's diary before his death: (Please refer to the end of this article)</p>
<p>Therefore, many people felt that Zhou Jiafeng, a 28-year-old teaching assistant from Hebei, seemed to be quite suspicious. However, in the morning after the incident, he went to look for his teacher Shiying (the deceased's eldest son, currently an associate professor at the Teachers College, who lives separately). The deputy director of the police department, Liu Geqing's, assumption was somewhat negative. He said: If it was a thief who had stolen his things before, and came to steal again (the murderer seemed to deliberately create a false impression, and stole a suitcase when leaving, which contained cheap summer clothes), then why kill him? And judging from the murder weapon, a firewood knife, and the five or six knife wounds in the same part of the neck, it must not be a handsome and bold habitual criminal. But judging from the bloodstains far from the bed, the deceased must have resisted, but why didn't the resistance make any noise, and the sound of the final struggle couldn't wake up the daughter and the maidservant? Although the maidservant is very young, perhaps she doesn't understand anything.</p>
<p>By 10 p.m. on the 23rd, the police department announced that the murderer who killed Xu Shouchang was Gao Wanche, a 22-year-old former worker at the Compilation and Translation Hall, who had been fired. After being fired, he repeatedly committed theft of stolen goods. The bloody clothes were found in Taoyuan. The police department solved the case in three and a half days, which can be said to be quite swift.</p>
<p>Xu's body was made up by the National Taiwan University Hospital and was laid to rest at his residence at 3 p.m. on the 20th. Officials from National Taiwan University, the Teachers College, and the provincial government all shed tears and handled the funeral for the deceased. The cash left by the deceased was only NT$1,000. (Our special correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>
<p>January 25th The money is for the "Dunhuang Research" manuscript.</p>
<p>January 29th Received a letter from Jingsong, saying that he had sent a copy of the biography of Lu Xun.</p>
<p>February 6th In the morning, I went to school and told Zhou Jiafeng to collect his salary (additional payment). More than 24,000 yuan. Because I was proofreading, I put it next to my leather suitcase first. After I finished proofreading, I wanted to go to the toilet, so I temporarily put the money in the drawer and went downstairs. When I returned to the room to wash my hands, Jiafeng also came in. I checked my sleeve, and the money was gone. It was only two minutes, which is shocking. Later, Xiaomei ordered the school police to investigate. Chief Zhou of the police paid close attention to Zhou Jiafeng and asked in great detail. I defended Jiafeng in every way.</p>
<p>February 7th I went to school to preside over the Chinese conference. I received a letter from Jiafeng, knowing that the school police had called him to the school for questioning yesterday afternoon. This matter is not good for his face, but the school police are in their duty and cannot but check from all aspects. Moreover, Jiafeng has been indecent recently and has had an affair with a female worker and had a child. Many people know about it, and people may suspect that his family is too burdened.</p>
<p>February 13th I fell asleep at 9:30 p.m. Between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m., a thief broke into the room and stole a new Fuji brand men's bicycle and a pair of new men's leather shoes. The thief entered through the courtyard and opened the door. It was not discovered until 6 a.m. I asked Chen Yaoqiang to report to the police, and they sent someone to investigate for a week.</p>
<p>February 14th Installed door and window locks. It's like locking the door after the thief has left.</p>
<p>February 16th Wrote to Zhou Jiafeng, approving his resignation.</p>

<h3>Public Funeral for Xu Shouchang Cremated Body Escorted Criminals to the Scene</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Electric, 23rd] Xu Shouchang's body was cremated at the Taipei City Cremation Management Office at 10 am on the 23rd, and a solemn public memorial service was held. Yang Lianggong, Xu Keshi, Lu Zhihong, and more than a hundred teachers and students from National Taiwan University attended. The murderer Gao Wanche was escorted to the scene, and the murder weapon and stolen goods were all seized and displayed at National Taiwan University. A memorial service will be held on the 29th, and Xu's ashes will be transported to Shanghai and buried next to Lu Xun's tomb in the International Cemetery. His eldest son Shi 瑮 and son-in-law Tang Zhaoshu will return to Shanghai on March 1st.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Southern Suburbs Rong and Hu Clans Compete to Open Outdoor Gambling Dens Mobilized More Than a Hundred People to Have a Large-Scale Armed Fight</h3>

Last year, in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, a lame man named Liu Decai, dressed in tattered military uniform, tricked him into going to Wuxi, lodging in a shed next to the Xicheng bus station.

After writing down the secret messages, he was ordered to deliver them to liaison stations of bandits in various places.

<h3>Ministry of Education Yesterday Issued Order to Rectify Academic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing 23rd dispatch] The Ministry of Education, given the decline of academic atmosphere in recent years, frequent student movements, and the exploitation of opportunities by unscrupulous elements, in order to correct the declining trend and stabilize schools, so that pure young people can be guaranteed to study in peace, issued the following order on the 23rd to rectify the academic atmosphere: "In recent years, the academic atmosphere has been declining, and after the restoration, it has become even more turbulent. Student movements have been frequent in various schools, mostly incited by unscrupulous elements who seize the opportunity to confuse and mislead. The general youth are coerced and threatened by them, either striking and marching, or relying on the crowd to coerce. The requests made are not only beyond reason and scope, but also treat themselves as superior, acting like negotiators, and if they are not satisfied, they resort to insults.</p>
<p>The Dignity of Academic Institutions is Completely Lost</p>
<p>In the 35th year, students of the Nanjing Temporary University Remedial Class opposed the examination, gathered crowds to cause trouble, and beat the class director. Last year, students from various schools in Nanjing collectively petitioned, shouting for days, occupying public offices, and obstructing official business. Students from Jiaotong University and Yingshi University came to Beijing in groups, gathered at the railway station, hijacked locomotives, and cut off traffic. A portion of students in Pingjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou also brewed a nationwide strike, market strike, and labor strike movement from May 20th to June 2nd. Recently, students of Tongji University were again exploited by villains, disobeying the mayor's teachings, striking and dropping out of school, disrupting order, and insulting the mayor, almost leading to a bloody tragedy. And there have been incidents of arson and destruction in universities. The dignity of academic institutions is completely lost, and society is deeply resentful! The public opinion is deeply indignant!</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, Responsible for Education, Cannot Stand Idly By</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, responsible for education, cannot stand idly by. However, because the instigators in the past were only a small number of students, and we deeply know that the behind-the-scenes planning and instruction are all done by the communist bandits and their tools, most of the young people in school are coerced and passive, and we really cannot bear to severely punish them without distinguishing right from wrong. However, the country establishes schools and teaches, so as to cultivate talents. Students enter schools to study, so as to accumulate knowledge and skills. Our country has fought for eight years, and its vitality has been exhausted. After the victory, the communist bandits made trouble, and agricultural and industrial production was severely damaged, and the central finances became even more difficult. The Ministry believes that the long-term plan lies first in cultivating people. Although limited by financial resources, it has not been able to fully meet expectations in terms of restoring school buildings and expanding facilities. However, it has made every effort to focus on students' studies, enrich the school's teachers, care for poor students, and reward outstanding students.</p>
<p>The Country Protects and Society Cultivates</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, students who transferred to the rear were not only assigned to schools and given public funds; since the victory, students in the recovered areas have also been examined with leniency according to their level, so that they have the opportunity to study and be promoted. At the same time, schools have been added to accommodate young people. All these huge expenditures are taken from the hard-working people. Today, our general young people in school disregard the country's protection and society's cultivation, sacrifice their studies, work hard for a day and freeze for ten, act outside the rules, and intensify their efforts, regarding schools as inns, and using them for idleness, regarding teachers as passers-by, and not knowing love and respect. The cunning ones take pleasure in launching movements; the simple ones are willing to be held hostage by a few, gradually belonging to a special class, isolating themselves from the laws and disciplines of the country, with wrong perceptions and strange words and deeds, so that communist bandit elements can incite and exploit them, exaggerating the illusion, or directing students from School A to interfere with the freedom of School B, or first ordering one place to launch and then instigating other places to respond. If this continues, the country's painstaking efforts to cherish young people will turn into the consequence of killing young people. The Ministry's investigation has confirmed that communist bandit pawns are willing to sacrifice national education.</p>
<p>Earnestly Admonish, Urgently Reflect on Past Mistakes</p>
<p>Now that the holidays are over, we especially use earnest admonitions to awaken the self-consciousness of students in schools across the country. They must cherish themselves, encourage themselves, respect the law and discipline, abide by school rules, strive for academic excellence, make up for past mistakes, and seek progress in learning. If they still do not know how to wake up, neglect their studies, despise school rules, destroy the law and discipline, and exceed the boundaries, then the black sheep must be removed, severely punished, and there will be no leniency. The Ministry is determined to maintain and excite educational order. It has long been determined to rectify the academic atmosphere. When necessary, it will not hesitate to dissolve or suspend schools that cannot be rectified. We hope that young students across the country will urgently reflect on past mistakes, mutually admonish and encourage each other, rebuild good discipline, and live up to the country's education. This is the order!</p>

<p>The initial price of edible oil rose by more than 100,000, and then it soared, seeing a crazy rise again. Because the price in Wuxi was higher than in Shanghai, the owners were very reluctant to sell. The market opened high, and there was a lot of soybean oil opening at 5.05 million. Later, due to the smooth collection by the inland merchants and local merchants, the price soared. Finally, Huilong soybean oil reached 5.28 million, a huge increase of 380,000 compared to last Saturday.

<p>Domestic tea buyers, seeing that sales in the local area and in the areas of Suzhou and Wuxi were booming, and that credit was becoming increasingly loose, intensified their activities.

<h3>Provincial Bonds Application for Exchange and Compensation - Interest Payments to Be Supplemented</h3>

<h3>Local Merchants Rushed to Purchase - Yarn Prices Rose Straight - Cotton Yarn Negotiated Prices Increased Again by the Yarn Management Committee</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton yarn market, because yarn prices in other ports soared, local merchants rushed to purchase, and the local market took the opportunity to enter the market. Because their positions were very loose, buyers were unusually active, and the market became more sharp-edged, and asking prices rose in a straight line. The initial price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn broke through the 90 million mark and rose to 92 million, where someone bought it. Although the Textile Construction Company suspended the offer for sale again when prices were high, the sentiment was strong, and absorption did not decline, and the market continued to rise. The closing price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 94 million, a continued increase of 9.5 million compared to Saturday.

<p>Cotton Cloth Soared</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, because yarn prices soared continuously, sentiment was consistently strong, and because credit was still loose, and the Guangdong, Hankou, and northern markets saw a great expansion in sales, asking prices rose again sharply. However, dyeing factories were not optimistic about actual sales and were inactive. Local shops and firms also rarely moved. Mid-way, some firms took profits, but the market rose after falling due to strong sentiment. As a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Longtou and Five Blessings, rose sharply by 145,000 to 223,000 compared to Saturday.

<h3>Curbing the Rising Tide of Yarn Prices: Yarn Control Committee Prohibits Southern Transport and Initiates Inspections with Local Governments</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Yarn Control Committee, in response to the recent soaring prices of cotton yarn and cloth in the Shanghai market, despite efforts to suppress them, has been unable to quell the rising tide. While there are many reasons, the excessive amount of yarn and cloth being transported south after the removal of restrictions on southern transport, coupled with the machinations of speculators within the city, are the primary causes. In order to take effective measures, the southern transport of yarn and cloth will be temporarily suspended starting from the 24th of this month. The committee has already issued a public announcement and notified the Jianghai Customs to handle this matter. At the same time, the China Textile Corporation has been ordered to sell off large quantities of cotton yarn, and joint efforts with local governments have been initiated to inspect warehouses and yarn shops, strictly cracking down on speculators hoarding goods. Once discovered, they will be severely punished, it is said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that cotton and cotton yarn prices have been soaring recently. According to authoritative figures in the cotton industry, the unreasonable rise in cotton prices is due to the fact that last year, U.S. cotton production increased by three million bales, or more than 12.2 million dan (a unit of weight), an increase of over 30% compared to 1946. China's cotton production also increased by two million dan. India's cotton production remained unchanged. The global cotton production is higher than in previous years.</p>
<p>Although China's cotton production is hampered by inconvenient transportation, the main cotton-producing areas, such as Shashi, Hankou, and the vicinity of Dongting Lake, have no transportation difficulties. Currently, the China Textile Corporation and the Agricultural Bank are purchasing cotton on behalf of others, with very good results. In previous years, purchasing usually stopped before the Lunar New Year's Lantern Festival, but this year, it has been intensified, so the amount purchased in various places is quite considerable.</p>
<p>Of the US$500 million in U.S. aid to China loans, it is stipulated that US$170 million be used to purchase U.S. cotton. Based on current prices, this will purchase 3 million dan. Once all of this is imported, China's cotton supply will definitely be more than sufficient, so there is no reason for cotton prices to rise. Furthermore, the sharp rise in cotton yarn prices yesterday saw 20-count Double Horse brand cotton yarn reach over 62 million yuan, exceeding the actual production cost. The responsible authorities are actively planning effective countermeasures, it is said.</p>

<h3>A Supplementary Explanation of Zhu Xi's "Investigating Things" and "Extending Knowledge" in the Great Learning</h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>Zhu Xi, in his commentary on the Great Learning, divided it into "Classic" and "Commentary." Because there was no commentary on the "Investigating Things and Extending Knowledge" in the "Classic," he adopted Cheng Yi's idea and supplemented it, saying: "The so-called extending knowledge lies in investigating things, meaning that to extend our knowledge, we must investigate things and exhaust their principles. For the spirit of the human mind is inherently capable of knowing, and the things under heaven are inherently endowed with principles; only because principles have not been exhausted, knowledge is not complete. Therefore, the Great Learning begins by teaching students to investigate all things under heaven, making use of their existing knowledge of principles to further exhaust them, seeking to reach their ultimate limit. After diligent effort over time, one will suddenly achieve complete understanding, reaching all the exterior, interior, essence and refinement of all things, and one's mind will be entirely clear and its vast utility will be fully understood. This is called investigating things, this is called the culmination of knowledge."</p>
<p>I have always believed that Zhu Xi's supplementary commentary, though not even a few hundred words, contains the seeds of knowledge formation, its subjective and objective conditions. It is truly enlightening when compared to modern Western philosophers' theories of knowledge. His theory of "investigating things to exhaust principles" is particularly in line with the spirit of science. It is a pity that later scholars' understanding was shallow and they could not carry it forward. Regardless of my own lack of knowledge and insight, I offer this explanation of Zhu Xi's intent for the benefit of scholars.</p>
<p>"The spirit of the human mind is inherently capable of knowing." This "knowing" can be explained as follows: the senses receive things and create sensations, which reach the mind and become awareness and knowledge. This ability to be aware and know constantly exists in the mind, responding to sensations and becoming awareness and knowledge. The Mohist Canon says: "Knowledge is the material. Knowledge is that by which one knows; but it does not necessarily know. Like light." "Knowledge is the material" refers to the inherent ability to know. Without contact with things, the material for knowledge has no way to be used, and the basis for knowing may not necessarily know. For example, the eye may have sight, but if it does not see, it cannot be said to see. Our mind already has the material for knowing. As for what is known, it is nothing more than the principles of things. When things come into contact with our mind, there is no other way but through principles. Therefore, to extend our mind's knowledge, we must investigate things and exhaust their principles. If principles are not exhausted, knowledge is incomplete. Furthermore, when the material for knowledge is applied to things, grasping their principles to form knowledge, there are also tools that do not need to be sought externally, but are inherent in our mind, such as the laws of thought in logic, and axioms in mathematics… These are examples. Now, when we say "investigate all things under heaven, making use of their existing knowledge of principles to further exhaust them," the principles that are already known initially are inherent in our mind and do not need to be sought externally. Using these as a basis, we then seek what is unknown, and then what was unknown becomes known, and we further exhaust what is unknown, gradually reaching its ultimate limit. The so-called "suddenly achieving complete understanding" means that when many principles have been exhausted, the effect of convergence and understanding is achieved, and what is converged becomes a common principle and general rule. Its use lies in using the past to know the future, and seeking the effect based on the cause. All of this is the work of induction and deduction in logic. When our mind first uses its inherent knowledge on things, this is the work of deduction. Then, investigating things to exhaust their principles, until sudden complete understanding, is the work of induction. Finally, holding on to the common principles and general rules obtained through complete understanding to deal with changes and predict the unforeseen, is again the work of deduction. It is fitting that "all the exterior, interior, essence and refinement of all things will be reached, and one's mind will be entirely clear and its vast utility will be fully understood."</p>
<h3>Manhan on Pragmatism</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Zhuoru</p>
<p>I believe the positive significance of pragmatism lies in removing the abstract barrier between thought and action. In a sense, this is an important step towards a new era of planning – a new kind of thought which is interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Pragmatism appreciates that every thought is essentially an organic part of action, and therefore opposes the old view held by some philosophers that pure theory has nothing to do with practical action. Except for someone locked in a monastery, thought should not be regarded as mere contemplation, that is, thought should not be merely for the sake of thought, but should be a tool for life or action. In real life, there is no thought that does not have a direct connection with action. To ignore or deny this consistency between thought and action is to deny that thought is essentially determined by the environment. From a scientific point of view, it is beneficial and harmless to reaffirm the creativity of action. It should be understood that only a new action can produce a new thought. This spirit has already borne fruit in education, because we can see that education now relies not on abstract preaching, but on a new educational technology. This method involves arranging the environment so that children can put the principles they learn into practice. Pure reliance on persuasion and rebuke has been abandoned.</p>
<p>The advantage of pragmatism lies in breaking down the abstraction that separates thought from action. However, pragmatism in its current form also has its shortcomings. This is that it limits the scope of action too narrowly. We cannot limit action to trivial actions in daily life, nor can we focus on a small circle of individuals and their immediate interests. This narrow interpretation limits thought to the stage of chance invention. In this situation, most are still unconscious adaptations – all for the sake of immediate survival. At this stage, thought is merely an unimportant supporting role, because it has no creative power. Thought only fills gaps in occasional, fragmented inspirations, and the skill of thought is no more than the significance of accidental discoveries in trial and error. If thought is to be able to project into the future, it must first deconstruct concrete things into abstract units in the image, and then recombine them in order to achieve the expected goal. This kind of thought is different from the accidental discoveries of the moment, and it is intentional invention. In short, this stage proves that abstract thinking originates from an activity higher than accidental discovery – the historical stage of inventing thought.</p>
<p>When thought transitions from the stage of unintentional discovery to the stage of intentional invention, the connection between thought and action cannot be directly grasped. This is why some idealist philosophers believe that thought has nothing to do with practical needs. At this stage, we can say that the idea comes before the action, and can direct the action. The typical example is: the idea of a house existed in the architect's mind long before the house existed in the outside world.</p>
<p>If we view thought in this way, it is easy to misunderstand that thought is independent of experience. In the stage of intentional invention, we cannot deny some of the abstractness of thought, just as we cannot completely agree that thought is irrelevant to the background of concrete activities. Although thought at this stage can transcend immediate needs, it is still not an absolute thing that is done for no reason.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem lies in recognizing that the background of intentionally invented thought is not completely limited to the scope of personal activity. Therefore, we can say that thought is absolute, meaning that it has little to do with personal activity. However, intentionally invented thought is still related to action in a broad sense. We should understand this point if we pay attention to how thought and action are intricately related in the entire historical group. Therefore, the practicality of thought at this stage cannot be seen solely from personal actions, but if we pay attention to the actions of the group to which that person belongs, the practicality of thought becomes apparent. Even the transition from unintentional discovery to intentional invention cannot be entirely attributed to individual achievements, but should be attributed to the entire adaptation of society, from the original, less specialized form of production (such as the primitive era of gathering and hunting) to more complex forms of specialization. Because of the progress of the division of labor in work and social functions, systems or things that were previously regarded as complete examples are now fragmented, because everyone only sees his part of the group work. Abstraction is not necessarily determined by external objects, but by the nature of the thinker's activities, especially by the organization of the group to which the individual belongs. Therefore, thought refers to "group thought." The broader the scope of activity, the finer the division of labor, and the more people who can view the same thing from different perspectives, the more necessary it is to clarify the matter. Socialized people have to avoid adopting individual and different views of systems and processes, and have to invent an abstract view that can be adopted by the entire society. Therefore, there may be many forms of abstraction, just as there are many ways for a social collective to solve problems. Therefore, the division of labor in work and social functions creates more viewpoints in a community than one person can need alone, so he can learn more than he actually needs. Society accumulates a large amount of experience and abstraction through language and concepts, in proportion to the amount of methods that have been commonly used in history. This can explain why a person is stunned by a large amount of available abstractions and feels that these categories and processes of thought are innate; methodologically speaking, this is equivalent to believing that his concepts and perceptions come from another world. In practice, the existing ideas (and vocabulary) can never go beyond the scope of the society in which he lives. Therefore, the illusion that thought in the invention stage has nothing to do with action is due to the fact that in a highly stratified and highly specialized society, the collective viewpoint can no longer be seen. The reason why he can maintain his intellectual detachment is because he cannot see how his personal experience is related to the social experience. In the stage of intentional invention, the pragmatist explanation can still be applied to the entire society, but not to individuals – at least not so directly.</p>
<h3>Writings of American Philosophers During the War</h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>During this Great War, American philosophers were quite active, as the author has reported in a previous article (this journal, issue 10). What I want to report now is the writings of American philosophers during the war. During the war, American philosophers continued to work hard at writing. First, looking at the various philosophical periodicals published by American philosophers, they not only did not stop during the war, but increased, and were even more lively than before the war. The longer-running philosophical journals, such as the "Philosophical Review," only slightly reduced some of their content, and continued to be published as usual. The "Journal of Philosophy" continued to publish with a length of 730 pages per year. Other journals, such as "Ethics," "Philosophy of Science," "Journal of Symbolic Logic," and "Journal of Social Philosophy" all continued to be published. In addition, the following new philosophical journals were added during the war: "Philosophic Abstracts" (published in 1939), "Philosophy and Phenomenological Research" (published in 1940), "Journal of the History of Ideas" (published in 1940), "Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism" (published in 1941), "Journal of Legal and Political Philosophy" (published in 1942), "Philosophical Forum" (published in 1943), and "Latin-American Thought" (published in 1945). With the exception of the last one, these new publications are still continuing to this day. The articles in these various publications rarely relate directly to the war, but there are particularly many articles related to social philosophy, democratic politics, freedom, and the philosophy of history.</p>
<p>Secondly, and most importantly, is the specialized writing of American philosophers during the war. During the war, American philosophers, on the one hand, had to participate in the war, and on the other hand, continued their specialized research without stopping. Judging from the various specialized works published during the war, their specialized research did not seem to be greatly affected by the war. Below, I will briefly introduce their specialized writings published during the war separately.</p>
<p>We should first mention that American philosophers published a "Library of Living Philosophers" during the war, edited by P.A. Schilpp of Northwestern University. Five books have been published in this series: one on the philosophy of Dewey, one on the philosophy of Santayana, one on the philosophy of Whitehead, one on the philosophy of Moore, and one on the philosophy of Russell. Each book contains the autobiography of the philosopher, discussions or criticisms, about twenty philosophical essays by the philosopher, the philosopher's own responses, and a complete bibliography of the philosopher's works. If we want to understand the philosophy of famous modern philosophers, the above five books are the most authoritative writings.</p>
<p>The next thing to mention is the research of American philosophers on classical philosophy. American philosophers also seem to have made progress in this area of research. Regarding the research on Plato, the books published during the war include R. Demos' "The Philosophy of Plato" (published in 1939), which systematically explains Plato's philosophy. Next, there is G.R. Morrow's "Plato's Law of Slavery" (published in 1939) and A.D. Winspear's "The Genesis of Plato's Thought" (published in 1940), both of which discuss Plato's thought from a social and economic perspective. In addition, Richard Robinson's "Plato's Earlier Dialectic" and Frederick Solmsen's "Plato's Theology" are also worth noting. Regarding the research on Aristotle, H. Cherniss published two books: one is Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy (Volume 1, published in 1944), and the other is The Riddle of the Early Academy (published in 1945). Philosophers after Greece are relatively neglected, and there are few works worth mentioning. However, the research on 19th-century philosophy in the United States is very lively. During this period, there were two philosophical eccentrics in Europe, one was Kierkegaard and the other was Nietzsche. Before the war, almost none of the former's works had been translated into English, but during the war, most of his works were translated by American philosophers. His thought has gradually attracted the attention of American philosophers. The latter, although a philosopher well-known in the United States, his thought was also a subject of renewed research by American philosophers during the war. C. Brinton has a book "Nietasche" (published in 1941), which specifically discusses the connection between Nazi propaganda and Nietzsche's thought. G.A. Morgan's book "What Nietzsche Means" (published in 1941) is more objective and more sympathetic to Nietzsche's thought. In addition, American philosophers are more interested in the research on American indigenous philosophy than before the war. For example, W.H. Sheldon wrote a book "America's Progressive Philosophy" (1942), T.V. Smitb wrote a book "The Philosophic Way of Life in America" (1943), and H.M. Jones edited a book "Ideas in America" (1944), all of which are helpful books for understanding American philosophy.</p>
<p>Finally, in the main body of philosophy, such as logic, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics, American philosophers also have some representative works worth mentioning. In the field of logic, there are C.C. Pratt's "The Logic of Modern Psychology" (1939), W.V. Quine's "Mathematical Logic" (1940), M.R. Cohen's "A.Preface to Logic" (1944), and R. Carnap's "Studies in Semantics vol. I" (1942), "vol. II" (1943). In the field of epistemology, there are Brand Blanshard's "The Nature of Thought" (1939) and L. Wood's "Analysis of Knowledge" (1941), the former starts from an idealist standpoint and the latter starts from a realist standpoint. Both are analytical in spirit and of great value. In the field of metaphysics, there is J. Maritain's "A.Preface to Metaphysics" (1939), which explains the viewpoints of medieval scholasticism. A.N. Whitehead's "Modes of Thouglit" (1939) has a thorough discussion of the close relationship between life and nature. In addition, W.T. Stace's "The Nature of the World" (1940) and D.H. Parker's "Exerience and Substance" (1941) are both from different perspectives to put forward their panpsychistic systems. In the field of ethics, the most noteworthy is C.L. Steuenson's "Ethics and Language" (1944), because it discusses moral concepts from the analysis of the meaning of language. John Dewey's "Valuation Theory" and B.E. Jessup's "Relational Value Meani" are not to be ignored. In the field of aesthetics, there is "History ofsm, 1949)", co-authored by K.E. Gibert and H. Kuhn. The former is the most complete history of aesthetics.</p>
<p>American philosophers also have commendable works in other departments such as social philosophy, political philosophy, and philosophy of history, but due to space limitations, they cannot all be described in detail. In short, the writings of American philosophers during the war, whether in terms of quality or quantity, have made progress.</p>

<h3>The Form and Essence of Objects</h3>
<p>— Wei Yuwen</p>
<p>A Précis of Bosanquet's Aesthetics, Part 4</p>
<p>Aesthetic feeling is tied to, or related to, the aesthetic object, especially the form of the object. The aesthetic mind, with respect to its object, seems not to value its essence, but rather appreciates its form. For example, with music, it does not care whether the sound originates from nature or an orchestra; it focuses on the melody. In relation to sound, melody emphasizes the form of the sound. Regarding sculpture and painting, it is not concerned with the wood, stone, paper, or ink itself, but rather with their expression, or the form of their expression. But what is form? What is the relationship between form and essence?</p>
<p>The most basic and shallow form of an object is its spatial outline or shape. Furthermore, general rules such as grammar, syntax, and the rhythm and format of poetry are also within the scope of form. This type of form is superficial, schematic, empty, pure, and contrary to the root or essence of the object, and to its so-called essential, true content. This form contains an implication of hypocrisy. For example, insincere etiquette is referred to as being merely a formality. This form appears to be unrelated to its content, as different materials seem to be able to express the same form. With this type of form, the form of the object is not the essence of the object; form and essence are different.</p>
<p>But can form truly be unaffected by its material, or not affect its material, and be completely different from essence? Can different materials truly express an entirely identical form? For example, can a bronze statue and a plaster statue perfectly represent the same person's posture? The truth is clearly not so. At the same time, we all know that different languages each have their own different forms, and the difficulty of translating poetry lies here. This proves that different materials cannot express perfectly identical forms. Furthermore, from another perspective, the same deep color, when expressed in different materials, appears as different forms of color, such as when expressed in a piece of coarse cloth and a piece of fine wool. The same deep shade of red in a sunflower and in a rose is different; two faces with similar outlines but different learning and cultivation are also different. This indicates that form changes along with its material. Thus, we know that material can affect form, and that form and essence have a close relationship. At the same time, we know that behind that superficial form, which is seemingly the opposite of essence, there is a more fundamental, deeper form that essence originally possesses. Or, to put it another way, each type of material has its own unique form. Such as clay, copper, stone, paint, color, silk and bamboo instruments, and language each has its unique form. Their form is their structure or the connection between their parts. This structure and connection determine how the aesthetic person or artist handles these materials or gives them a more refined style. This means that the form of the essence determines the artificial form. But it is this form that transforms the different parts into a unified organism, turning dull and tasteless materials into an object that is full of interest, endless meaning, and vibrant life. Therefore, form can also affect material. Form makes an individual what it is; in other words, it makes an object what it is. But what makes an individual what it is, is the essence or soul of that individual. Thus, form is essence. The form of essence can be expressed as movement, can be expressed as life, can be expressed as myriad changes and hierarchies, and can reveal profound meaning. Therefore, the spatial outline and shape are only its most superficial layer. Form and essence are inseparable aspects of an object. So-called empty form and absolute material are both the result of abstraction and have no relation to real truth.</p>
<p>But form and essence are ultimately different. Their difference is like the difference between the soul and the body. You cannot transform either aspect into the other, and both aspects seem to have their own reality, so they are not the same. But neither aspect has a separate, independent reality; when combined, they are completely beautiful, and when separated, they are both harmed, so they are not different. Not the same, not different – this is precisely the relationship between form and essence.</p>
<h3>Forbidden Talk in Academia (10)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Irving Babbitt on Eastern and Western Culture</p>
<p>The late Harvard University professor Irving Babbitt (1865-1933) was a master of the New Humanism. Many famous professors in China were his students, and the essence of his theories has been introduced repeatedly. In Babbitt's view, the world should be regarded as a single unit, and history should be a record of all of humanity. Confucius, Buddha, Jesus, and Aristotle are of equal importance. The United States, located between Europe and the Far East, should become a bridge for communication between Eastern and Western cultures, and should not erect barriers between the East and the West. He hoped that Americans would possess the fortitude of the British nation, while removing its insular arrogance. In terms of attitude, Americans should adopt the advantages of the two great nations of China and France.</p>
<p>Babbitt believed that the true center of Western culture was Paris, France. He felt particularly delighted by the academic atmosphere of Paris, and once said that if a student could master French, the benefits gained at the University of Paris might exceed what could be obtained at Oxford University. Babbitt studied in France in his early years, and in 1923 he returned to France as a visiting professor at the University of Paris, where he gave lectures; one course, taught in English, was titled "British Romantic Poets," and the other, taught in French, was titled "Rousseau." His profound knowledge of French was praised by scholars, and some said that his reputation in France might be even higher than in the United States. Babbitt opposed the Rousseau-led Romanticism of France, and he did not approve of the Naturalism of the Victorian era in England. The former placed too much emphasis on emotional effects, while the latter placed too much emphasis on mechanical effects; both extremes were common ailments of modern culture. Babbitt believed that the World War was a natural result of the bad ideas that had been accumulating since the 19th century. The Humanism he advocated was aimed at remedying these shortcomings. Humanism originated in Greek culture and was tacitly in agreement with the doctrines of Chinese Confucianism. Since the Renaissance, many scholars in Europe have devoted themselves to this field. However, modern humanists must understand the methods and spirit of science and keep pace with the times, hence the name "Scientific New Humanism."</p>
<p>Babbitt was proficient in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and Pali. He preferred Buddhism to Christianity and left behind an English translation of the Pali Buddhist classic (Dhammapada). However, he regretted that he had not learned Chinese. In 1900, he married Rosa Drew in London. Babbitt never visited China, but his wife was born in China and had lived there for many years. However, Babbitt believed that he understood China to a degree that his wife could not. His wife felt unconvinced, believing that since her husband had never traveled to China to observe it firsthand, how could he truly know China? Babbitt believed that understanding people lies in understanding their hearts, and that the same is true for a nation or a country; relying solely on sensory perception is not enough to deeply understand their people. His wife finally agreed with him.</p>
<p>After the age of forty, Babbitt's reputation gradually grew, and talented students from home and abroad flocked to him, which was one of the joys of his life. Among the Chinese scholars who studied under Babbitt, Mr. Mei Disheng of Xuancheng was the first. When Mr. Mei first arrived in Cambridge, Babbitt was only fifty years old and full of energy. He talked about philosophy and religion with Eastern students more than he talked about literature. Babbitt felt a sense of kinship with Confucius's doctrines and was also aware of the shortcomings of traditional Chinese culture. Several Chinese landscape paintings hung in Babbitt's study, all of which were gifts from Chinese students. Babbitt believed that what the paintings represented was not just the scenery, but a kind of natural and unconstrained spirit, which made him feel extremely happy at heart. Babbitt deeply regretted the decline of Confucianism and expressed his earnest expectations to his Chinese disciples, believing that the revival of the Chinese nation was related not only to China itself.</p>
<p>(The author also has an article titled "Babbitt – A Teacher of One Generation," published in the 46th issue of "Thought and Time," a memorial issue for Mr. Mei Disheng.)</p>

<h3>Eating (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Baishui</p>
<p>Chinese philosophy is built on eating. "The state takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven." These are the words of politicians. "Food and sex are human nature," and "Empty the mind and fill the belly." These are the words of pure philosophers. "When the granaries are full, people know propriety and righteousness; when clothing and food are sufficient, they know honor and shame." This is yet another saying. In short, without food, everything is troublesome; with food, everything is solved. Our ancient sages have long recognized this, which is another perspective compared to the West's sole pursuit of civil rights. Therefore, society refers to occupations as "rice bowls," and because of their varying quality, there are gold, iron, and broken rice bowls. Those with jobs call themselves "scrambling for food," as if eating is the ultimate goal, and everything else is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The impact of eating primarily manifests in material enjoyment, which is almost entirely concentrated on eating. As the saying goes, "Wearing is for the wind, eating is for enjoyment." While wind is good, it is ultimately not as good as enjoyment. Therefore, moralists encourage people by saying, "If one can chew on vegetable roots, everything can be done" as a standard for self-cultivation. – They completely fail to consider that today's refugees regard even rotten vegetable leaves as treasures, but these poor wretches are only destined to suffer, and they have no chance to do anything! – Conversely, when officials and nobles have excessive amounts of money, the easiest way to display wealth is through eating. I once read "Spring Ice Studio Field Notes" by Li Yuerui, which includes a section on the extravagance of river officials, which is almost entirely focused on food. For example, ducks are chased on red-hot brick floors just to eat their webbed feet, dozens of pigs are slaughtered just to eat their tenderloin, and even more strange is the world-famous monkey brain eating. "Brain-filled and fat-bellied" monkeys are dressed in red clothes, their heads are shaved, and they are placed under square tables with holes. A hammer strikes, opening their skulls, and guests each use pre-placed silver spoons to scoop up the fresh brain matter to eat. Amazingly, some people can actually do it and eat it! Furthermore, Cantonese people eat snakes and civets, glorifying it as a "dragon-tiger fight," and Fujianese people (or Cantonese people) eat small mice that have been fed with honey. When Alexander Vertinsky heard about these things, they were laughing matters. Moreover, even among all the savage tribes in the world, these eating methods and objects are sufficient to rank at the top without shame! Foreigners eat for nutrition and for energy for work, but Chinese people do not pay much attention to this. Wealthy old men and women may take tonics, or young masters and young ladies may take yin-nourishing and yang-strengthening supplements, but that is beyond nutrition and energy and is regarded as medicine, not food. After the war in Britain, even if you were a minister, you would only be rationed one egg and four or five pounds of bread per week, and meat and fat were even more limited. Although they also suffered terribly, they still endured and persevered. If it were in China, there would be chaos. When Bertrand Russell traveled to China in the past, the Hunan warlord held a banquet that lasted from noon until three or four in the afternoon, and the dishes were still not finished. Russell had already eaten so much that he could not eat anymore and had to say that he was finished. The Chinese officials all laughed at him for being unsophisticated. It is said that the Manchu Han Imperial Feast of the Qing Dynasty had 120 dishes. Even if you ate one dish per minute, it would still take two hours to finish. What's more, there was also drinking and gambling? The ancients had already said the words "strength for a long meal," and when Wang Mang became emperor, according to Kang Youwei's "New Learning Forgery Classic," Liu Xin and others specially forged the "Zhou Li" to cater to this ambitious scholar, saying that the Duke of Zhou stipulated that the emperor's meal should have 120 dishes, and that 120 jars of welcoming gifts were needed, and that the emperor's three consorts, nine concubines, twenty-seven wives, and eighty-one imperial spouses were also exactly 120 wives. Perhaps the full feast of later generations originated from this? If this is true, then the history of eating in our country is also long, long ago.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are all kinds of cultural forms derived from eating, such as cookbooks and food manuals that discuss eating, drinking games and wine policies that discuss wine, and books of etiquette and sacrificial rites that discuss etiquette – people love to eat, and gods and ghosts also love to eat. The oracle bone inscriptions record that the special sacrifices to the deceased mother killed up to 300 cattle. Isn't it shocking? The ancients said that when a country was destroyed, they would only say that "the ancestors did not receive blood sacrifices," as if even though people were dead, the problem of eating still existed and was very serious. The character "sacrifice" itself means holding meat to offer to the gods, which is even clearer. Foreigners offer flowers to the dead, but China does not do this. – Even the stories and jokes that arise from food and drink occupy an important position in past publications. Someone flattered Chinese culture as a culture of eating. A plate of chop suey has already made foreign steaks retreat in fear. If we were to bring out our full set of skills in frying, stir-frying, stewing, boiling… wouldn't we make the foreign sons eat their sores? Moreover, Chinese cooking is very abstract. Unlike foreigners who specify how many grams of salt and pepper to use, our "Yi Ya skills" rely entirely on the experience of the old stewards, looking at the heat and looking at the color. The same shark fin, cooked by someone who has worked as a cook for the late Dean Tan, is different from the others. Old restaurants must have a few signature dishes that others cannot imitate, and old diners must be able to pick out or instruct on the various vegetables. Didn't the Guangheju in Beijing used to have the sayings "Pan Fish" and "Jiang Tofu"? To this day, the restaurants on West Chang'an Street in Beijing all have something called "Mr. Ma's Soup," which is said to have been instructed by Ma Xulun. I don't know if this is true? In short, the Eastern spiritual civilization should not only be expressed in words and thoughts, but also in food and drink. Therefore, even if you follow the Suiyuan Food List to cook various side dishes, I am afraid that the result will be a failure.</p>
<h3>Honest Advertisement</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Commercial advertising is generally perceived as "boasting and exaggeration," and there is indeed no shortage of merchants who hold this attitude when doing such advertising.</p>
<p>"Today's tomatoes are too ripe. It is best to come back tomorrow to buy them." – Do you believe this is a sentence from an advertisement? In fact, it is, and it is an advertisement made by the "Farmer's Market" in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Earl Wright Burke, the advertising director of the "Farmer's Market," has adhered to the principle of "telling the truth" since the market opened in 1934. His honesty has created prosperity for the market.</p>
<p>A large film company, admiring Burke's name, hired him at a high price several years ago. As soon as he took office, his new boss called him in and asked him how he planned to do things.</p>
<p>"I'm going to tell the truth," Burke said. "If one of our films is terribly bad, I'll say, 'Ladies and gentlemen, you'd better stay home tonight and listen to the radio.' If one of our films is good, I'll advise them to take the shortcut to the local theater to see it."</p>
<p>The boss was shocked and showed an embarrassed look that said "find someone better." The next day, Burke happily returned to his old home, reunited with vegetables and his old customers.</p>
<p>Salesmen like Burke are not unique in the United States. Here are some simple examples:</p>
<p>John Wanamaker in New York once advertised: "We have a batch of worthless raincoats, now selling for $1.49 each." However, the next day, all the raincoats were sold out.</p>
<p>A lampshade merchant advertised to promote lampshades that cost one dollar each: "Of course, these lampshades are not as durable as those made of expensive parchment. If they are too close to the light bulb, the paper on the shade may turn black. They will probably last for one or two summers."</p>
<p>Saks Fifth Avenue in New York said: "We paid too much, we bought too much. Frankly, we are having cash flow problems." Below this was: "Three-piece spring mattress sets for sale. Comfortable, but difficult to move. Let go for $140, which can help to improve its appearance."</p>
<p>Merchants who publish this type of advertisement directly establish credibility, so when they offer something worth buying, people trust them deeply. They are also usually able to sell the goods they disparage – if the price is indeed low.</p>
<h3>New Year Customs in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Yinxiang</p>
<p>The folk customs of Taiwan are similar to those of other provinces. They also celebrate the Lunar New Year very lively, and the first three days of the first month also follow the old customs.</p>
<p>The first day of the first month is a good day for family reunions, and everyone spends it at home. A married daughter is not allowed to return to her parents' home on that day, otherwise she would be hoping for her parents' family to be poor.</p>
<p>The custom of New Year greetings is to be held on the second day. The climate in Taiwan is very warm, like early summer in all seasons, without winter cold, so the preserved vegetables will spoil if they are left out for more than three days, so it is stipulated that the second day is the day for feasting. If there is a new bride, she must accompany her new groom back to her parents' home on that day. According to custom, the bride's parents should send someone with some gifts to the groom's home, indicating that they are inviting the bride to play at her parents' home, and the groom will buy some return gifts to take with him. The bride dresses up beautifully on this day and returns to her parents' home, first congratulating her parents and saying many auspicious words. At that time, the mother's joy is indescribable, and she takes out rice cakes and many things that her daughter likes to give her to eat. The bride can eat and chew heartily, drink spring wine with her sisters, and have fun, telling each other everything about her husband's family. Some even go shopping or play cards or watch a play together after drinking. The parents-in-law watch the son-in-law with smiling eyes, and the uncles and aunts can make fun of the new son-in-law. All families celebrate this second day in the same lively way, until it is dark, the new couple return to the husband's home. This day is also commonly known as "Double Return."</p>
<p>The second day of the Lunar New Year is the liveliest of the three days, and everyone celebrates wildly. The streets are full of women dressed in red and green. The business of cars and rickshaws is particularly good on this day.</p>
<p>The third day, however, is particularly taboo. Folk customs call it "Red Dog Day," which is a very unlucky day. No major events take place, and no one goes out to avoid bumping into any stars. (Lunar New Year in Taipei)</p>
<h3>Automatic Price Reduction</h3>
<p>— Yan Ping</p>
<p>In recent years, all that has been heard is a series of price increases and adjustments, so hearing a "no price increase" is occasionally exciting, and if you encounter a truly "big price reduction," you would definitely find it surprising instead.</p>
<p>Tuition fees have already been stipulated by the authorities. However, there are still a few private schools that think it is too low and not enough to cover expenses, so the Bureau of Education, in order to prevent excessive charging and exceeding the standards, Director Li has decided to personally investigate in order to prevent abuses. Who knew that in this situation of preventing exceeding the standards, there would be a discovery of "sudden price drops"!</p>
<p>The situation in Nanshi is indeed not comparable to that in Beishi. Just in the area near Beishi's Xiaoshijie, private elementary schools are too numerous to count. The fees have always been lower than stipulated, and this time the situation is even more unexpected. The stipulated fee for private elementary schools is two million yuan, but on the posters in the Nanshi area, the fees charged by each school are often less than half of the stipulated amount, or even only a quarter of the stipulated amount!</p>
<p>This situation is, of course, welcomed by most parents. But the sudden price drop in the midst of price increases has aroused research value.</p>
<p>The expenses of the schools in Nanshi are, of course, slightly lower than those in Beishi, but they cannot be reduced by half or a quarter. Teachers in both the north and south cities need the same minimum standard of living.</p>
<p>So, how can there be a phenomenon of sudden and sharp price reductions? According to the school authorities, it is to take into account the situation of the families, to reduce the fees to the possible range of parental burden, so as to avoid a sharp increase in the number of out-of-school children. Some of these schools have boards of directors, or various associations and trade unions, bearing the recurring expenses, which are originally semi-obligatory in nature, so reducing the fees does not affect the teachers' salaries.</p>
<p>These schools' "automatic price reductions" have given the bosses of general academic shops a warning! It is hoped that schools that are founded for education can be influenced by each other!</p>
<h3>The Spring Breeze Remains</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>I have not celebrated the Lunar New Year for several years. The Lunar New Year has been abolished, so it seems unnecessary to celebrate it happily. But looking at the enthusiastic appearance of others, I can't help but feel puzzled. This time, I rushed back to Shanghai from Nanjing, looking askance at the Lunar New Year with one eye, and I can still see the spring breeze.</p>
<p>I watched the large crowds of people lining up in Xiaguan in long queues. Due to the large number of travelers returning home for the New Year, tickets are even harder to buy, and a few anxious people began to riot. The police grabbed their collars, and one of them explained to the police officer in panic: "I want to go home for the New Year!" The travelers almost all carried oiled chickens or pressed ducks. A sister-like figure was instructing her younger brother: "Tell mother that although I can't go home for the New Year, I still want the New Year's money. You have to save it for me!" After the train passed Danyang, many of the passengers had fallen asleep. I admired the various postures of dozing and guessed their sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Thanks to my appetite, I ate four New Year's dinners, three were full banquets, and one was at a slightly poorer friend's house. Although the occasions were different, the mood for eating New Year's dinner was the same. Whether it was at a wealthy family's house or a poor friend's house, this meal was the warmest of the year for them. Children can boldly gobble it down, and no longer have to pay attention to the adults' eyes; the wife puts the chicken leg on her husband's bowl: "Why are you so polite!" The father kept shouting to his children: "Please! Please!" As if they were not eating together every day.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, the Lunar New Year is still the warmest festival for most people. The New Year's bonus and dividends make people's pockets feel heavy; those who owe debts also feel lighter on their shoulders because the last month of the year has passed. I saw those who work hard all year round get warmth in the New Year. Entertainment venues are crowded with people who rarely go there once a year. I declined two friends' invitations to watch a movie in the New Year, and I said in a reproachful tone; "Do you want to steal their warmth?" Trucks beating New Year's drums are speeding on the road, firecrackers are flying around the ears, and the sound of dice is ringing in the doors…</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year has been abolished, but the spring breeze remains!</p>
<h3>Hometown of Xiang Yu</h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>I recently read Ke Manjun's article "Visiting the Hometown of Xiang Yu" in the Free Talk section of the February 19th Shen Bao. It said that Xiangli was in "southwest Vietnam," which is quite different from what the author had visited. I will only describe what I know, as follows:</p>
<p>According to the "Biography of Xiang Yu," Xiang Wang was a native of Xiaxiang, and "Xiaxiang" is explained in the dictionary as present-day Suqian County, Jiangsu Province. Suqian is a place that the author had visited in the past, so I know it well. "Xiang Wang's Hometown" is located about a mile outside the south gate of Suqian. Before the war, it was opened as Xiangli Park, with an attached Xiangli Elementary School. In a tiled house, there was a huge stele with the four large characters "Xiang Wang's Hometown" written on it. An old locust tree stood tall beside it. The elders said that it was planted by the king himself. There were many inscriptions in the park, such as those by Zhang Zhijiang, Lai Lian, Wu Mai, and Yi Junzu. The author still remembers that Yi Junzu also had the line "The Chu traveler bids farewell to the overlord on a long journey, and the grass and trees in Suqian are all fragrant."</p>
<p>Inside the south gate of Suqian there was also a Xiang Wang Temple, which was converted into Xiang Wang Temple Elementary School before the war. It was adjacent to the Provincial Senior Glass Vocational School (Suqian is a famous glass producing area). The temple enshrined statues of Xiang Wang and Consort Yu, sitting side by side. Mei Lanfang's performance of the play "Farewell My Concubine" was very popular at one time. At that time, in order to make it more realistic, someone was sent to take photos, but the statues of the king were refined and gentle. Although they were not as beautiful as a woman, as Zhang Liang was praised by Sima Qian, they were not as fierce as the later legends said. The play was not put on stage, and Jin Shaoshan was finally chosen to play the role of "Overlord."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Consort Yu was from Yugou Cliff in Shuyang, a neighboring town of Suqian. Therefore, the people of Suqian often jokingly said that they and the people of Shuyang were related, which is to jokingly trace this marriage. (Recompense)</p>
<h3>European Royal Troubles</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Almost all of the few remaining royal families in Europe are facing the same problem: more princesses than princes, and some simply have no male heirs to the throne.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the British royal family has only two princesses, and Princess Elizabeth recently married Captain Mountbatten. Princess Juliana, the heir to the Dutch throne, recently gave birth to her fourth daughter, meaning that no male has sat on the throne since 1884. Even worse is Denmark, where Prince Frederick has only three daughters, and according to Danish law, princesses cannot inherit the throne. Only after April 1946 did the Swedish royal family find some comfort when King Adolf finally had a son after having four princesses. Similarly, Prince Olaf of Norway had a large number of daughters before finally having a precious son, who is now only nine years old. Romania is even more tragic. King Michael has always been a widower, and only when attending Princess Elizabeth's wedding was he moved by the beauty of Princess Anne of Denmark. However, the members of Parliament did not facilitate this union, and did not agree to the marriage. Michael was forced to abandon the throne and is scheduled to marry Princess Anne in May, thus ending this pitiful dynasty. King George of Greece has divorced the Queen and has no intention of remarrying, so there is no talk of a crown prince. The Belgian royal family has lost its center, and the country is still being governed by a regent.</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that many of the heirs to the throne are female, the more serious problem is that it is almost too difficult for so many princesses to find husbands of equal status, because their husbands must be princes or dukes from other royal families. Only God knows how this problem will be solved in the future.</p>
<h3>Washington's Motto</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiu</p>
<p>Here are Washington's mottos written by himself in his youth:</p>
<p>Do not rejoice when others encounter misfortune, even if the person who encounters misfortune is your enemy, you should not gloat. Do not lightly believe when you hear words that slander others.</p>
<p>In clothing, strive for simplicity and avoid being unconventional.</p>
<p>If you cherish your reputation, you should associate with people of noble character. It is better to be lonely than to be friends with bad people.</p>
<p>Do not easily promise others what you can do yourself; but once you have promised others, you must fulfill your promise.</p>
<p>Strive to nurture that beautiful little spark in your heart – the name of this little spark is "conscience."</p>
<h3>Lin Daqin's Ignorance of Historical Facts</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>Chaozhou's culture has always been dilapidated. Since Han Changli (Han Yu) of the Tang Dynasty was demoted here, people gradually began to value learning. Taking advantage of Duke Wen's (Han Yu's posthumous title) influence, they boasted of themselves as "Zou Lu (a place of culture and education) by the sea." However, when I examine the prominent historical figures, they are very few, and I can count them on my fingers. Their achievements were mostly at the level of Weng Wanda. After him, there was no one worth mentioning. However, Chaozhou people value success in the imperial examinations, so the name of Lin Daqin, who won the first place in the Ming Dynasty, is uniquely prominent. Even today, people frequently mention his name, using it as a source of pride. Daqin's writings are not widely seen. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of one or two in local and county gazetteers, but they are superficial and not far beyond mediocrity. But when I read his "Record of the Reconstruction of Yunyan," it is extremely desolate and full of empty words. Daqin said: "Qi Zhang (Niu Sengru) and Pingquan (Li Deyu) ordered their descendants not to lend even a stone to others. Now their descendants have not been without incidents. This rock is located in a remote mountain, and it has not been obtained by powerful people. Therefore, even after changing generations, later people can still repair the remnants of the relics and restore them to their original state. Isn't this fortunate?" Qi Zhang refers to Niu Sengru (Sengru was conferred Duke of Qizhang), while Pingquan is actually about the affairs of Duke Wei Li Deyu. Those who have some knowledge of records can all speak of it. Daqin was ignorant and did not know, isn't it a laughingstock? Some say that the affairs of Wei Gong's Pingquan are only seen in novels, and not recorded in history. It is not a serious matter that Daqin made a mistake. This is not the case. The Old History of the Five Dynasties says: "At the beginning, when Deyu was a general and minister, he made great contributions to the royal family, and served as a regional official for many dynasties. When he stayed in Luoyang, he had the ambition to spend the rest of his life there. He built a villa in Pingquan, collected rare flowers and strange bamboos from all over the world, and exotic stones, as a garden. He wrote a family motto to record where he obtained the plants and trees, and inscribed it on a stone, saying: 'If you move my stone or break a branch of a tree, you are not my descendants.' During the chaos of Chao Cai, Luoyang was reduced to ashes. Zhang Quanyi cleared the weeds and established the capital. The flowers and trees of the Li family were mostly moved and dug up in the capital by woodcutters for sale. The garden was swept away." (The above is seen in the biography of Li Jingyi. Jingyi was the grandson of Duke Wei Deyu, the Grand Commandant.) The history is described in such detail, how can it be said that it is not recorded? Therefore, I know that Daqin is not only too shallow in his knowledge, but also never reads historical books. Wei Gong's Pingquan motto is often cited by later generations, and it is not an obscure allusion. Moreover, the origins and endings of the Niu (Sengru) and Li (Deyu) factions are something that everyone must learn. To not distinguish this, I cannot imagine what books Daqin has read. Lin Daqin's mistake of Niu for Li has already caused the ridicule of knowledgeable people! And those who compiled the local gazetteer used the power of many people, but they also rashly published it without examining its errors. This is even more ignorant. I often lament that Chaozhou lacks the seeds of reading, and this proves that there is truly no one there.</p>
<h3>Giving Gifts</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>Mrs. Qiong said happily to the country boy, "When I see your mother tomorrow, I must thank her for giving me such a delicious cake."</p>
<p>The little boy hesitated for a moment and said, "Ma'am, can you thank her for giving you such delicious 'two' cakes?"</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Full of Doubts 78</p>
<p>At this time, Qi Huan's nerves were greatly stimulated, so she went with the flow and no longer restrained herself. Qi Huan's intention was not about the wine, but to use this opportunity to make Zhu Zhai feel disheartened. However, Zhongjie regarded Qi Huan as a treasure falling from the sky, and once he got it, he never wanted to let it run away again. That night, Qi Huan wanted to go back several times, but Zhongjie used excuses to keep her, and it was not until the afternoon of the next day that she returned with Miao Zhongjie in the same car. Zhongjie went to Qi Huan's boudoir and saw that every room was decorated very elegantly. He had been fighting outside for many years, half his life on horseback, and it was his first time trying such gentleness. After he arrived in Beiping, although he continued to indulge in entertainment venues, most of what he saw were prostitutes and "hotel girls." Qi Huan's residence had the atmosphere of a noble lady, and it was the first time he had experienced it since arriving in Beiping. Therefore, as soon as he arrived at Qi Huan's home, he looked around in the front and back rooms and could not bear to leave. He and Qi Huan sat on the fur in the guest room, asking about this and that. Although he was a military man, he was good at words in front of women and was good at understanding women's psychology. Qi Huan usually had high standards and did not pay much attention to anyone. Even to Miao Zhongjie, she only thought of using him to stimulate Zhu Zhai and did not sincerely want to befriend him. However, since they met, Zhongjie tried his best to flatter her and carefully pleased Qi Huan. That day in Qi Huan's room, they whispered to each other, and talked for two hours before he was willing to leave. Zhu Zhai was so angry that his hands and feet were ice-cold. He wanted to go back several times, but Xiao Wang's mother kept him, not allowing him to leave, saying, "Now that you are here, and you have suffered all day yesterday, you should tell the boss about this situation. I think the boss must have a reason for getting to know people in the military. Don't you think so?" After being told this by Xiao Wang's mother, Zhu Zhai's anger subsided slightly. He thought, if I just leave like this, it would show that I am narrow-minded and give Qi Huan a bad impression. It would be better to wait for her guest to leave, then I will go in and advise her not to make friends with these rich people, as they are only playing around. After thinking this, Zhu Zhai nodded in agreement. Xiao Wang's mother let him sit in the wing room and wait. Zhu Zhai patiently waited for another hour before the guest left. By this time, it was already dark. Qi Huan sent the guest back, and Zhu Zhai originally wanted to rush out of the wing room and ask her, but then he thought, it would be bad for Qi Huan's face if I did that. It would be more appropriate to wait for Xiao Wang's mother to inform her before I go up. So he stayed in the room and did not come out. After more than ten minutes, Xiao Wang's mother pushed the door and came in.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation</p>
<h3>No Provision for Pre-Collecting Business Tax on Goods Still in Transit</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Renzhi of Wu Tongtai Grain Store in Taixian County asks: Regarding the reinstatement of the grain business tax, although the grain merchants nationwide are still requesting continued exemption, whether it can be approved is another matter. Now there are several doubts that I would like to have answered. If you can forward them to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance for explanation, I would be even more grateful.</p>
<p>(1) What is the object of the grain business tax collection? (2) Are boats and vehicles transporting grain subject to collection? (3) Is it necessary to have a special tax ticket for grain in transit in order to pass through? (4) Is it legal for the local authorities here to set up checkpoints on major roads and collect business tax from passing boats and vehicles? (5) According to Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Business Tax Law promulgated by the National Government on April 16, 1946, "Factories or producers that have already paid factory tax or production tax" are exempt from business tax. Are raw materials purchased by factories that pay production tax exempt while in transit?</p>
<p>[Answer from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance]: (1) The object of the grain trading industry is the price of the goods sold (income amount). The object of the grain brokerage industry is the business income (commission or handling fee). (2) Boats and vehicles transporting grain are regarded as the transportation industry and are taxed at a rate based on the business income (freight). (3) Regarding the third, fourth, and fifth points of the original question, after investigation, the business tax is not levied on "goods" but on "people." It should only be levied when the business operator engages in business activities and has an actual sale. (Residential merchants are taxed monthly, while traveling merchants are taxed each time). However, all business operators (whether residential or traveling merchants) should apply for registration with the local business tax authority before starting business according to law. As for business operators whose goods are still in transit and there is no sales activity, there is no provision for pre-collecting business tax according to law. If there is such a situation, you can state the facts, attach the documents, and report it for punishment.</p>
<h3>Selling Paper Molds to Relieve Poverty and Illness</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Xueyu has worked in cultural circles and state-owned institutions in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guilin, and Chongqing for more than ten years. He is currently employed by a company in this city and is a poor salaried worker. Recently, he has been bedridden for several weeks, and medical expenses are urgent. In this difficult situation of poverty and illness, he has decided to sell the paper molds for various books in Chinese and English that he already has, in order to cover medical expenses. I respectfully ask people from all walks of life to give assistance, buy these paper molds, and save me from poverty and illness. I will never forget your kindness. If you would like to contact me, please send a letter to Gongxing Company, No. 762, Fangbang Middle Road, Nanshi.</p>
