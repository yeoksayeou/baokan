<h3>七八兩季輸入限額　核減近二千萬美元　提今政務會報告後公布　英鎊法郎慮布俟匯率洽妥再兌換</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕政院經濟管制委會十四日下午四時在政院一號官舍舉行第四次會議，出席委員王雲五，俞鴻鈞，陳啓天，秘書長徐柏園等。俞大維，關吉玉，孫越崎，谷正綱，李惟果等有關部會首長均列席。由兼主委翁文灝親自主持，首由秘書處報吿各地執行管制物價及管理金融情形，繼由工商部長陳啓天報告煤之供應及煤之定價問題。旋卽進行討論（一）第七·第八兩季輸入限額。（二）英鎊與其他各國幣券收兌問題，據財部報吿，央行對此正在研究，除美金·港幣·菲幣可以向央行兌換金圓券外，其英鎊·法郞·盧布持有人，先可以存入央行或其委托之銀行，托由該行收存保管，由央行發給保管證，俟將來央行與英·法等國洽妥匯率後，再行兌換或動用購買准許輸入之原料。（三）關於糧食供應問題，對於各大都市之配售制度，決定重行考慮，尤其對於大都市中有能力之富戶獲得配售之優待，咸主應重行考慮改進。據關吉玉在會中報吿稱：各都市之糧食供應情形均甚良好，新榖登塲後，各地糧源均顯充旺。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕第七·第八兩季輸入限額表，十四日下午政院經濟管制委會會議中業已核定，將俟十五日政院政務會中提出報吿後，卽於下午合併公布。經管會十四日核定之第七·第八兩季輸入限額表，根據「整理財政及加强管制經濟辦伕」第九條第一項之規定，較之第五·第六兩季平均標準，已减少四分之一以上。第五·六兩季輸入限額總數爲七千三百四十七萬六千美元，第七·第八兩季總額則僅五千餘萬美元，約减少近二千萬美元。此次限額表之編制，純爲節省國家外匯，而採合併編制方式，與第五·六兩季合併編制之用意相同。限額表附表（二）中所列之項目，第五·六兩季共列廿一項，第七·八兩季已减爲十九項，原列之卡車。汽車兩項，均已删除，以免增加汽油之消耗，其他各項進口物品，均普遍較前减少百分之廿五之譜。會中除核定限額表之詳細數目外，同時復決定三點：（一）凡國內廠商在八月十九日以前已在國外所訂購之機器工業配件及許可進口之工業原料，責成輸管會訂定辦法，定期登記，准許申請輸入。（二）凡國內之外商，如果以自有之資金由國外購買，確係私人自行裝配使用之機件，可定期准許輸入。（三）外商輸入之汽車五百輛至六百輛，將另案辦理。</p>
<h3>銀行業戰前存款放款　清償標準重審查　立院通過促速建南海省　北平「七五」臨時戒案不予追認</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立法院第二會期第二次會議，十四日舉行，晨九時半由孫院長主特開會後，首進行報吿事項，除通過第一次會議議事錄，決議對德統咨爲北平地區七月五日宣吿臨時戒嚴請追認案予以否決外，並處理政院及考院咨送伕案十七件。旋開始討論事項：第一案爲該院國防，法制兩委會報吿審查軍人撫卹條例草案案，以國防部函爲改革幣制後，草案內容又需變更，決定俟重行修訂審查後再議。第二案爲孔庚等提「請將前立法院奉令審議通過之銀行業戰前存款·放款淸償標準重行審議修正，以昭公允，而平民憤，俾本案完全結束，免釀事端案」，決議交付民法·財金兩委會會同審查，至十二時散會。午後四時續會，孫院長因病請假，公推委員羅衡主席，繼續進行討論事項，第三案爲邱昌渭等提議修正立院議事規則案，決議交法制委會審查。第四案爲張慶楨等提議國人存放國外外匯資產登記管理，應促請政院從速制定施行細則具體辦法，以期有效實施案，決議交財金·外交兩委會會同審查。第五案爲內政及地方自治與國防兩委會報吿會同審查王俊等提議，促請政府執行決議，迅將海南島改省案，決議依審查意見通過「海南島改省案應卽付話實施」。第六案爲糧政與財金兩委會會同重行審查孫翔風等·劉雲昭等·曲直生等提議有關糧政三案案，決議依審查意見通過，除曲案建立糧倉系統，事關糧食政策重大改變，須於本會期從長計議外，孫·劉兩案合併決定兩點：「（一）收購縣級賦榖，從定購時起，應逐月按市價核付，於每月十日前將價款撥出，並儘量簡化撥款手續，其詳細辦法，由糧食部·財政部及國庫局會商決定之。（二）收購賦榖之運輸，應由糧食部·國防部負責辦理」。第七案爲牛踐初等提議，綏靖區·非綏靖區土地改革政策，應同時普遍實施，以符國父平均地權遣敎，而利戡建大業案，決議交付地政·法制兩委會會同與政院咨送之「綏靖區土地處理條例草案」合併審查，至下午六時全部議程處理完畢，宣吿散會。</p>
<h3>蔣總統電鄂參會</h3>
<p>徵借准緩徵五分之一</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十四日電〕蔣總統頃電復鄂省參會，對該會所請豁免本年征實征借一案，已准就徵惜部分按原配額緩徵五分之一，惟征實部分仍應原額配征。</p>
<h3>轉輛用油攙酒精　將先在上海試辦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十如日電〕政院爲節約汽油，日前曾召集工商部轍管會及中國石油公司等機關商討油料統驚調節方案，在該會中出席人員多以燃油進口供不應求，建議車輛用油攙和酒精，並經會中決定由工商·國防·交通等部及資委會等機關會商按術問題，現工商部已邀集有關各部會商討，結果已決定汽車用油攙和酒精，先在上海試辦，並由工商部呈政院轉咨立法院，完成汽車用油攙和酒精立法程序。</p>
<h3>立院運用否決權　「七五」戒嚴案討論時情緒熱烈</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立法院十四日晨首次運用憲法賦予之否決權，對七五北平戒嚴案拒絕總統七月廿六日之咨請，不予追認。今日會議議程所列之第一件報吿案卽爲：「總統咨爲北平地區自微（七月五日）日午後七時起宣吿臨時戒嚴，請查照追認案。」孫院長對此案建議於全部報吿案件宣讀完畢後，依立院組織法第八條規定，逕卽進行討論。松江省立委王寒生首先發言，渠根據監委谷鳳翔，胡文暉之調查報吿，指出國防部臨時戒嚴報吿表及傳作義原電所列舉之戒嚴原因不符事實。監院正擬對政府處理七五事件之措施行使職權，立院如予追認，無異承認政府之措旅爲正當。依憲伕規定，總統自有宣布戒嚴權，然追認權在立院，如不問究竟卽予追認，實屬放棄權力，有虧職守·王氏詞畢，立獲贊同掌聲，旋劉振東，黃宇人，孫桂籍，程天放，劉明侯，張潛華等相繼發言，或提議該案保留，或提議改變議程，俟監院對七五事件有所決定後再議，唯大多數皆主張應根據事實法理立卽決定追認與否。熱烈討論一小時後，孫院長徵求會衆同意，先以是否付審查表決，結果在塲委員三〇六人，反對者一二一人，贊成者一〇八人，均未過半數。至此，復以是否追認付表決，結果贊成追認者僅二人，另一人舉手在可否之間，孫院長當宣稱：「總統咨爲北平地區自七月五日起宣吿臨時戒嚴請查照追認案，決議不予追認。」此一議題乃於鼓當聲中結束。</p>
<p>〔又電〕權威人士談稱：平「七五」戒嚴之措施，乃平警備司令部決定，經政院會議決議核准者，總統僅據行政院呈報轉咨立法院，請予查照追認。今立法院旣以該措施根據之理由不充分，拒加追認，總統自將據復還飭行政院重行查核辦理。戒嚴措施之是否不當，或決定並執行該措施之官員之是否將受行政處分，仍須俟監院決定是否行使糾正權及糾舉權而定。立院不追認之決議，使該戒嚴措施在監院未決定應採步驟前，仿不能取得法律根據</p>

<h3>平參議員歡迎會上　張厲生快語淋漓　暢論為人作風自認軟弱　學穆罕默德一手持劍</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕張厲生十四日在平參議負歡迎會中，暢論渠之爲人及作風。因參議員沈承慶當塲指責張氏督導北方財經改革，作風太慈祥，未多接近民衆，指張氏所稱平津與滬有異，不必過嚴，爲不明責任，而希張氏檢討過去，策勵未來。張氏對此鄭重答稱：今人多阿諛，如此忠言，師友之間亦少見，實畢生不能志。繼稱：說我慈祥不敢當，只可說是軟弱，我之所以不能勇，卽因不能慈，智仁勇爲三大德，「智」之所以居先，乃貴在先知而後行，語云「治亂世用重刑」，我不願多說此種帝王特權的話，今天要民主，政府不能濫施淫威，應法當其罪。我是北方人，深知平津經過八年敵偽壓榨，有錢者固亦有，而大多患窮，如操切行事，實無好處，嫉惡如仇是我天性，但我只能學穆罕默德，一手持經，一手持劍。張氏臨行時尙吿記者，今天的情形難得，希望你們多寫。</p>

<h3>響應勤儉建國運動</h3>
<p>古稱勤儉起家，從來成家立業，致治興邦，沒有不從　兩字做起的。因爲勸卽努力工作，儉是戒除浪費：勤的目的，在增加收入，儉的作用，在减少支出。如此標本兼施，積極與消極兩方面同時下手，無論爲齊家，爲治國，安有不蒸蒸日上之理？</p>
<p>只因海通以還，西洋奢靡的風俗，逐漸東來，國人厭故喜新，耳濡目染，養成了一種洋化的風氣，而且只知享用，不圖生產，只重享樂，不務積貯，以致連年出超，國力凋敝。這種情形，如果長此繼續下去，縱然天災人禍，內憂外患並不相逼而來，國家的元氣，也可耗散殆盡，到了不堪支持的地步。何况軍興十年，通貨膨脹，一般人民，在救死扶傷，東牽西補之餘，亦知道貯以待用，不如取快一時，於是盡情悄費，只顧目前，大家不知道儲蓄爲何物。我們看到農村衰落的景象，與銀行存款的激减，對於國民經濟前途，實早已不勝杞人之憂！</p>
<p>現在中樞當局，爲配合經濟改革的措施，聞有勸儉建國運動的擬議，其綱領已載昨日本報。這在表面上看來，雖似老生常談，並沒有甚麼新穎的意義，然而要致富圖强，培植國本，却不能不從這基本工作上做起。大家知道，增加生產，應是一切經濟改革的基礎，而非全國上下，埋頭苦幹，加緊工作，斷不能達到增產的目標。至於把中國式的生產，與西洋式的享用，同時並進，產銷勢必脫節，收支愈益失衡。誰都知道，這是今日我國社會經濟的致命傷！從前蔣百里先生曾說，「生活條件與戰鬥條件脫離者，國恒亡·」我們可以套他一句老調，而說悄費方式與生產方式脫離者國恒貧。所以勸儉這兩個字，在平時固未可忽視，而在此時，尤見爲急要。</p>
<p>拿英國來做例吧，她在二次歐洲大戰之後，雖以耗用過度，其國力已遠不如從前，然而產業發達，出口旺盛，去年國家收支，並且有鉅額的盈餘，而在悄費方面，到如今還維持着十分嚴格的配給，在工作方面，連婦女也還遭受着國家的支配，眞可說地無曠土，人無廢事。這在公私交困普徧鬧窮的我國看來，豈不應倍加警惕？</p>
<p>上文說過，通貨膨脹，貨幣失去了儲藏的能力，這未始不是促進浪費的一個因素。故在幣值步步貶落，物價日日上升的時候，要求儲蓄孳息，把一般剩餘的購買力保存起來，這確不是一件容易的事。但在幣制改革以後，顯已今非昔比了。因爲各地厲行限似，同時嚴禁囤積，今後物價看穩，幣值已無虞低落，而金圓券公開發行，且有固定的最高發行額爲之限制，亦斷不慮其過於膨脹，故我們日前在行莊增資與儲蓄的一文中，已提到鼓勵儲蓄這一着，就是爲在今後的環境中，實行儲蓄的可能性，確實比前增高不少了·今中央正在加强節約，同時並提倡勤儉建國運動，想必也在利用這個良好的環境，把國力重新培養起來。</p>
<p>我們中國的風氣，一向是由上而下的，所謂君子之德風，小人之德草，草上之風必偃。故在這個運動展開以後，除希望社會各階層聲應氣求，普徧響應以外，仍望一般大人先生以身作則，樹之風聲，以爲人民校楷。從前的國貨運動，文吿屢頒，在當局未始沒有推進的誠意，而終於言者諄諄，聞者藐藐，這個失敗的敎訓，似也值得深長思吧！</p>

<h3>上海往何處去？</h3>
<p>— 蔣經國</p>
<p>九月十二日對上海青年軍聯誼會大會講辭</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>今天我們國家有一個大的弊病，卽是有許多人明知我們是一個窮的國家，而偏要裝出一個當的樣子來。假使我們單從上海貝當路來看中國，則中國文化水準，已很高了，又假使單從所謂上海人華麗的服裝，時髦的汽車，來看中國，則中國人的享受，已超過任何國家了。但是貝當路究有幾條？穿華麗衣服，乘時髦汽車的人又究有多少？我可以說，是極少數的，極大多數的人，仍是住在草棚茅屋，亭子間的，甚至還有千千萬萬的人，流落在街頭巷尾，呻吟在田野溝壑之中，他們簡直是一羣乞丐，甚至連穿一雙草鞋，也認爲是一種難得的享受了</p>
<p>我們應當很坦白的承認，我們國家是貧窮的國家，我們的同胞是痛苦的同胞，要知道從外國來的汽車·冰箱·香水·玻璃絲襪·都是寄生在貧窮國家中的白血球，都是摧毀國民經濟的鴉片烟，用外匯來換取高貴的奢侈品，這是民族的自殺政策，我們並不反對對外貿易的發達，但我們應該知道，我們所需要的乃是機器，和製造機器的機器，因爲只有國家的工業化，電氣化，才能使貧窮國家變爲富强的國家。在過去所患的弊病，卽是大家不肯承認中國是一個貧窮的國家，不知道貧窮的國家應有貧窮國家的打算。我們今日確是一個貧國了，但是難道繼續讓他貧窮下去嗎？不是的，繼續窮下去那就是毀滅的道路。</p>
<p>我們爲什麼窮至如此呢？自辛亥革命，以至抗戰勝利，在這三十餘年間，我國曾遭遇到不斷的外來侵略，以至今日，我們還未能使我們國家的人民吐一口氣。外來的敵人，當爲帝國主義，但內面的情形又怎樣呢？我們內在的敵人，在鄉村有土豪劣紳，在城市有投機奸商，這兩種力量，互相標榜，互相利用，結果造成了今日國家不安的原因，同時共產黨的發展亦卽利用了這一弱點。因此，更加重了今日國家的困難。我們如要不窮，就必須剷除這一致窮的因素，這是一件偉大的事情，也卽是國民革命發展到最後階段中最嚴重最困難的事情。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我們旣承認自己的國家爲窮國，但能不能以其窮而不顧呢？只有不孝的子弟，才看不起窮苦的父母；也只有不孝的黃帝子孫，才看不起窮苦的祖國。正因爲國家貧苦，同胞貧苦，所以我們更應該愛護他，保護他，和救護他。歷史上的英雄豪傑，其所以爲世世代代人民所敬仰，卽是在於他們的血是爲國家流，他們的生命是爲國家犧牲，愛國，保國，救國是中風傳統的偉大精神，盡忠報國，是中國人民認爲最光榮的事業。然而，時至今日，却有一部份人爲美鈔，黃金，珍珠，寳貝所麻醉，而忘了國家，更另外有一部份人被外來的不正確所謂時髦的思想所麻醉，而忘了民族，他們都麻醉了，已經不會再想到一個人沒有國家的痛苦，也再不會想到被國家所拋棄的人，是如何的痛苦，他們做夢也想不到，如果沒有國家，將來的生活，恐怕連白俄·猶太人也不如了。</p>
<p>蘇聯一向是提倡一全世界無產階級聯合起來」的國家，但在德軍打到離莫斯科不遠時，他不得不將「全世界無產階級聯合起來」的口號收藏起來，換上「保護祖國」的口號。蘇聯之所以擊敗敵人，取得勝利，並不是拿「全世界無產階級聯合起來」的口號相號召的，而是拿「保護祖國」的口號來號召的。南斯拉夫的狄托是史達林的信徒，共產黨的忠實黨員，但當他想到自己國家的切身利益時，即很勇敢的脫離共產國際。由此可知在今天的時代，世界革命，國際路綫，都是走不通的道路。我們要生存，就必需要有國家，這也即是說，我們中國人，只有在靑天白日滿地紅的旗幟之下，大家才有生命。（下轉第三版）</p>

<h3>三使節昨再訪克林姆宮　與莫洛托夫會談　要求保證解除柏林封鎖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播莫斯科訊：英美法三國專使於莫斯科時問下午六時，（世界標準時間下午三時）前往克林姆宮，會晤蘇外長莫洛托夫。先是英專使羅伯茲及法大使夏台岳曾往訪美大使史密斯，對各該國政府建議作最後一分鐘之檢討，然後乘汽車前往克林姆宮。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：據悉，十四日克林姆宮之四强會議，史達林並不參加。又訊，除非蘇联能改變態度，使會議獲有進展，英美法三國已同意準備決裂。柏林封鎖除非立卽解除，則西方列强決將柏林問題提交聯合國大會討論。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕可靠方面息：西方三使節將設法在莫斯科與蘇當局舉行柏林局勢之決定性會議。史達林將否參加此次會議，僅有克林姆宮可作決定。史氏如不擬參加，則三使節諒將會見莫洛托夫。此間認爲三使節將直接請史達林明白命令柏林之蘇帥，保證封鎖將予以解除，及該處在細節方面之談判可繼續無阻。討論柏林危機之對蘇會議，自由莫斯科移往柏林後，蘇聯方面忽提出各項技術問題，遂使獲得解除柏林封鎖及發行柏林單一幣制之協議之希望全遭打破。此間英方人士認爲，使柏林情勢緊張之暴動，如蘇軍司令不以制止之直接訓令頒予德共黨，難保不再發生。</p>
<p>「合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日在白宮與杜魯門總統單獨商談，諒在談論蘇聯祖不解除柏林封鎖後之爆發性局勢，但馬卿與國務院其他官員均不肯談論此次會議或柏林情勢入於何種階段。</p>
<h3>討論義殖民地處置問題國　四强無妥協希望　勢將提交聯合國大會處理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播巴黎訊：四强代表今晨十一時舉行第二次會議，法代表建議將索馬里蘭交還義大利，在聯合國託管制下，由義國加以統治，英美均已接受，但蘇聯表反對。法國另一建議凡四强會議中發生之問題，交由專家委員會研究，英美法三國意見亦已一致。就現勢推斷，關於義殖民地問題絕少獲致協議之希望，卽對於利比亞，伊利特里亞及索馬里蘭之今後處置問題，四强代表是否有權決定一點，意見亦不能趨於一致。倘至十五日仍不能獲致協議，則依照對義和約規定，此一問題必須提交联大會討論矣。</p>
<p>〔洗國新聞社巴黎十四日電〕倫敦外長代表會議有關義殖民地之報吿書，現已列入議程，將由列席四强代表加以研究。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十四日電〕據悉，美英國將設法使聯合國通過保持義屬利比亞之現狀，因美國在利比亞西部擁有空軍基地。十四日晨西方國家希望維持目前軍事管理狀態，但蘇聯則建議一切殖民地均歸還義大利，此點無疑爲西方國家所反對，此一問題之戰略價值遠過去經濟與政治之上。蘇聯則將盡量利用機會，使義共能獲得反英美宣傳之題材。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十三日電〕出席聯大會之美代表團七十一人，大部份已於今日乘「美洲」號郵船前赴巴黎，該代表團係由奧斯丁及羅斯福夫人率領。杜威外交顧問杜爾斯現留於歐洲。馬歇爾定十九日飛巴黎。</p>
<h3>對日和會問題　美態度冷淡</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕外交界談稱，外傳中國將在本屆聯大會中提出其締結對日和約之意願，此說如果屬實，不過乃中國並不擬將此事列入議程，僅欲試探四强關於締結對日和約可能性之意見耳。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕頃據可靠方面息，美國最高級官員對日本和約問題仍然冷淡，彼等以爲本年內東西　見茍一日懸而未決，卽使集合五强對此問題作一初步會議，亦未見可能。雖然彼等已逐漸察覺遠東之戰略形勢對蘇聯在歐洲擴張之重要性，但美高級官員認爲在目前提出日本和會問題仍有未妥。外交界人士表示，此問題能否在聯大會中討論，乃屬疑問，蓋聯大議程並朱列入也。</p>
<h3>美對華航空包裏週六起照常收寄</h3>

<h3>上海往何處去？</h3>
<p>— 蔣經國</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>（上接第二版）我們在承認中國是貧窮，中國必須獨立生存時，我們同時也應當承認中國是一個具有力量的國家。中國有如此廣大的土地，豐富的地面和地下的物資，以及四萬萬五千萬勤勞樸實的同胞，這實在是一個取之不盡，用之不絕的天然的偉大力量。然而我們所可惜的，是沒有機會來開發他，發動他，使其發揮出來。我們如要將我們的國家，從貧窮變成富强，就必須來運用這個力量。我們可以說，等到這個力量發揮出來時，這一力量將必是全世界最偉大的力量。不獨此，我們中國還有一種隱藏的潛伏的精神力量，這個卽是我中華民族的正氣，和人民的高尙道德。中華民族在每一個重要的關頭，從不屈服，實言之，這卽是一切力量的泉源。當日本帝國主義向我們進攻時，我們自知沒有充分力量去抵抗强大的軍閥，但犧牲已臨最後關頭時，我們就毅然決然不顧一切的起來抗戰了，最後，我們終於得到了勝利。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，共產黨對政府施以壓力和引誘的手段，仝圖來組織聯合政府，那時國內甚至有不少的人，出來批評政府戡亂的決策，但至生死存亡的關頭，政府始終並未爲之屈服。組織聯合政府，許多人認爲卽可以停止戰爭，但大家須明白，聯合政府如果成立了，那我們的國家，恐怕早已變成捷克·波蘭·羅馬尼亞了。幸而我們尙有傳統的不投降，不屈服的精神，所以今日雖窮，雖苦，但仍保持了獨立的人格。領導我們革命的蔣總統，就是這中華民族正氣的代表者，他是偉大的領袖，他的偉大，正是在於他處在最艱難，最困苦，最危亂，最複雜的環境中，而他却要能不畏艱難，不怕困苦，從狂風暴雨中來拯救國家和人民。我們相信在領袖領導之下，我們國家必能保持獨立自主的地位，如趁此時機，我們全國萬衆一心，同心協力，繼續不斷的奮鬥，那我們的國家，就一定能從貧窮而變爲富强，這是無用懷疑的。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>今日國家的環境，是相當困難的了。這個困難的環境，也的確是國家的一個危機。但我們可以說，這個危機，亦能變爲轉機。現在我們已臨到非下決心來澈底改革國家的政治經濟不可了，國家需要存在，人民需要生活，我們經過了八年的抗戰，三年的戡亂，人民的生活，自己苦不堪霄，但要改善人民的生活，就必須安定社會，就必須穩定經濟，要穩定經濟，就必須改革幣制，這一理由，甚爲明顯。所以我可以在這裏說，現在政府所頒佈的新經濟政策，並不僅僅是一種簡單的法令，而應將他看作是一種社會性質的革命運動，是實行民生主義的開始，今日的抑平物價，不過是一種技術上的工作，而眞正的目的，乃是在消滅社曾上經濟不平等的現象，更確切的說來，就是不允許社會上滋長着的一種富者愈富，貧者愈貧的現象。</p>
<p>許多人懷疑到此次新經濟政策是否能達到成功。這是難怪的，因爲在過去有很多政策，都是失敗了。但假使將這個政策看作是一種社會革命運動的話，同時又用革命的手段來貫澈這一政策的話，那麼，這一政策，我相信一定能達到成功。不然，如將這種事情看作是一種普通政令，臨時應付，敷衍了事，那我們就不如不做，就是做來，亦將是要失敗的。因此，我們認定這次新經濟政策的性質，卽是一種革命運動，所以我們自開始以來，卽主張發動廣大的民衆來參加這偉大的工作，並應吿訴人民，這是我們自己的事情，應該自己起來完成，人民的事情，只有用人民自己的手可以解決，靠人家是靠不住的，要想將舊社會翻過身來，非用最大力量和最大代價是不能成功的。今日已到澈底改革的時機了，就上海而言，這裏的社會確已腐燜了，不過，我們也不應忽略，上海雖是腐亂，但反抗的力量仿然存在，因此，我全體人民，必須有計劃的，有組織的，有步驟的去進行這一艱巨的工作。有很多人都認爲今天的局勢非變不可，是的，應當變，現在且已正在變，但是，最奇怪的，從前主張變的人，忽然又不主張變了，或者說要漸漸的變，這些人，不瞭解社會的變動，一定會遭到不測的風雲，以及意外的困難，他們一看到危險和阻碍，就怕起來了，那是不成功的，現在旣然開始變了，那就要變到底，而且要變出一個道理來。（下轉第四版）</p>

<h3>經營黑市金鈔案特庭提審四被告　傳到中國水泥公司經協理作證　韋伯祥梅吉供詞有出入　愛齊爾承認曾出賣美鈔</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行法定外匯經紀人韋伯祥，韋妻姚載英，猶籍俄人梅吉，安南銀行總經理洗人愛齊爾人，因有經營黑市金鈔嫌疑，前經特種刑庭偵查起訴，昨日該庭提出在押之韋伯祥等四人，並傳到證人中國水泥公司經理史乃修，協理姚淸德作證，由審判官蔣善初公開審訊。</p>
<p>下午三時許，審判官升座後，卽飭提在押四被吿立於一旁，韋面容白晳，着方格薄花呢西裝上衣，灰色啥咪褲，黃皮鞋。韋妻而色淸瘦，髮束粉紅綢，着藍色旗袍，淡灰色洋毛外套，赤足，着黑緞綉花鞋。愛齊爾身材魁梧，花白頭髮，面色紅潤，戴眼鏡，着藍色西裝上衣，灰色褲。梅吉體較瘦小，戴眼鏡，花呢西裝韋妻與韋竊竊私語，韋妻時以白手絹揾淚。</p>
<p>首傳設人姚淸德訊問，其訊問中心爲查究韋伯祥作爲交易之三萬美鈔來自何處。據姚稱：上海人，住延慶路一二一號，業商，韋前妻爲渠之阿姊；任中國水泥公司協理；因中國水泥公司向輸出入管理委員會聲請進口原料，經該會核准每月四萬美元，共二十萬美元，分四，五，六，七，八個月結匯，八月初交給中國銀行六千美元，尙有三萬四千美元於八月廿六日交韋伯祥轉交中央銀行購買結匯證明書，手續費爲法幣五十七萬四千元，該款交與韋伯祥以後情形則不知道。</p>
<p>證人史乃修稱：五十二歲，浙江嘉善人，住中正中路八七七弄六號，任中國水泥公司經理，渠在公司內所負責任爲推廣業務，至經濟調度，則由姚負責，僅知三萬四千美元係向公司總經理借來，由姚交與韋伯鮮購買結匯證明書，因此事係姚經手，內容不詳</p>
<h3>四被告口供</h3>
<p>韋伯祥供稱：八月二十六日姚將三萬四千元美鈔交我之後，因二十七日係孔子聖誕節，銀行休假，該款未及送入，適因梅吉向我借款，臨時借給他一用，我爲中央銀行指定外匯經紀人，每日美鈔出進均在十餘萬元上下，對此三萬餘美元之臨時借款，初不以爲意，不料情形竟如此嚴重。</p>
<p>姚載英供稱：與韋同時前往梅吉家中有之，但並無携帶運送美鈔情事。</p>
<p>梅吉否認曾向韋借美鈔三萬元，惟稱因韋需款，渠借給韋大通銀行之金圓券十二萬零九百九十九元支票一紙，約合美鈔三萬元，韋卽以三萬美鈔抵押，並非買賣行爲，梅承認曾於八月十八日向愛齊爾購買美鈔三千元，每元價格爲法幣一千零七十萬元（按卽當時黑市價格）。</p>
<p>愛齊爾亦承認曾將三千美鈔賣與梅吉，惟該項美鈔並非渠本人所有，係洗國友人存於彼處，友人業已返法。</p>
<p>五時許訊畢，姚載英當庭請求交保不准，諭知呈送聲請狀聽候裁定。四被吿均還押。</p>
<p>當步出洗庭時，攝影記者紛紛獵取鏡頭，章伯祥戴上太陽眼鏡，梅吉俯首疾走，愛齊爾用白絹蒙面，三人手均銬上，由法警押赴特庭看守所覊押。</p>

<h3>同濟醫院違法　抬價被人密告　蔣院長遭傳訊</h3>
<p>同孚路同濟醫院，被人向警察局密告，違法抬高，普通門診五十萬元改爲金圓三角，特別門診一百萬元改爲金圓六角，配尼西林每針一千五百萬元改爲金圓六圓，入院預收費三億五千元改爲二百金圓，病戾普遍漲二成至六成。警局經濟警察大隊接報後，於昨日派員將該院院長蔣益生拘傳到局，依法偵訊懲處。</p>
<h3>房地產業漸趨活潑　客掀風作浪平均漲起二成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕八一九幣制改革後，物價波動幅度縮小，各業市塲均趨向平靜，而螫伏已久之地產業，頗有復蘇之槪。昨據地產業中人談：幣制改革後，國行收兌金鈔所溢出之游資，頗多集中地產一項。交易雖呈活潑，惟實際成交並不多。此可自地政局方面辦理房地產過戶案件中查考，蓋八一九後之過戶案件，並未較前增加。渠稱：八一九後本市房地產喊價，約較前增漲五成。此項喊價，大多係掮客掀風作浪，鮮有成交。而眞正之成交價，約較八一九前增二成。據解釋：房地產雖無法作人爲之限價，惟天然之限價依然存在。蓋眞正欲購置房地產者，旣可解決投資及房荒問題，又能博得擁護當局建屋政策之美名，何樂不爲。然地價過高，造屋後社會上無法消納，亦屬徒然。據佔計：一年來本市陸續落成之房屋，約有一萬幢，惟房屋之折舊率亦頗嚴重，估計一年亦達五千幢。渠希望將來一切安定之後，房地產應有一合理之措置，則盛行一時之頂費問題，可吿消滅。目前因（一）政府當局有意獎勵資金歸向房地產一途，（二）地價高低，與民生無關，政府僅須管制租金，故本市房地產業前途，有日呈活潑之趨向云。</p>
<h3>酌撥愛儷園捐地　籌建新聞館獲一致通過　馮有眞越君誼等臨時動議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議員馮有眞·趙君豪。詹文滸·唐世昌·張志韓等八十餘人，昨提臨時動議一起：請於哈同喬治捐地中撥給五畝，籌建新聞館，其理由稱：上海爲全國新聞事業中心，居於領導地位，從業人員有數千之衆，戰前原有公會會所，規模粗備，八年抗戰，播遷轉徙，會所淪胥，自復員後公會重吿成立，迄已三載，顧以種種困難，至今猶無固定會所。最近哈同喬治捐獻愛儷園土地，業經本會決議接受，並在該地上建築岡書·美術等館在案。竊以新聞事業爲世所重視，上海尤爲國際觀瞻所繫，從業報人如是其衆，進修研究無由集合，國內外記者或道經上海，或來滬觀光，苦無安頓之所，而各界人士與報業接觸·宣佈·解答或徵詢某項問題時，亦乏適當之處，匪時記者本身時感痛苦，即就整個上海市而言，亦當引爲缺憾。茲特建議大會，請在哈同喬治捐地上酌撥五畝，建築新聞館一所，將新聞記者公會，報業公會一併遝入，此外並籌建報人招待所及大會堂，俾供全國報聯集會之需，此後各國新聞會議或可於上海召集，亦非不可能之事。至所有建築費用，當由報業公會與記者公會合力自行籌措，無需耗費公帑，增加市民負祖。並建議辦伕二點：（一）在哈同喬治捐獻愛儷園土地中劃撥公地五畝興建新聞館，請市府與圖書館。博物館一·美衛館，同時籌畫。（二）建築費由新聞記者公會與報業公會自行籌措。討論結果：全體參議員一致贊成，本案順利通過，惟對撥地面積，由市府統籌，暫不規定畝數。</p>

<h3>上海往何處去？</h3>
<p>— 蔣經國</p>
<p>（上接第三版）在工作的推進中，有不少的敵人在那裏恐嚇我們，放言繼續檢查倉庫懲辦奸商，將會造成有市無貨，工廠停工的現象。不錯，似使站在保持表面繁榮的立塲來看，那是會使人民失望的；但是，如果站在革命的立塲米看，這並不足爲懼。沒有香烟，絨綫，毛衣，綢緞，呢絨，甚至猪肉，是沒有什麼可怕的。因爲五百餘萬的上海人，能穿高貴衣料的人，並不算多，只要我們握有大衆日用的必需品米鹽油煤布其實足够生活了。我們相信，爲了要壓倒奸商的力量，爲了要安定全市人民的生活，上海的市民，是絕不畏缺乏華麗衣着，而致放棄了打擊奸商的勇氣，投機家不打倒，冒險家不趕走，暴發戶不消滅，上海人民是永遠不能安定一天的。至於講到工廠停工的問題，政府的政策，是以三民主義爲指導原則，保有私有財產，獎勵私營企業，過去是這樣，現在是這樣，將來也是這樣。但是如果廠主以停工來作咸脅的手段，那決沒有什麼可怕的，你們不辦廠，自然總有人來辦，有了這樣的決心和勇氣，新經濟政策是決不會失敗的。今後只要做到到繼續生產，人民有飯吃，使得有錢的人不去投機，而來從事生產事業，做得上海的經濟走上正軌，人民的生活走上經常化的道路，以有這樣，才算是新經濟政策的成功。我們決不怕破壞者的威脅，投機者的恐嚇，我們只有抱定犧牲的精神，來貫澈新經濟政策的執行。</p>
<p>再要講的，另外還有許多似是而非的所謂經濟理論家，他們以爲解決經濟問題，應從純經濟的觀點出發，否則將要愈弄愈亂。這種觀點，是不瞭解經濟與赴會政治的關係，不曉得經濟問題中蘊藏了許許多多社會政治的因素，不曉得社會政治影響經濟的作用，更不曉得經濟結構的建立，是有賴於社會政治的力量，經濟與社會政治在許多盤根錯節的問題中，實在難以分開的。我們應該明白地吿訴大家，經濟問題的解決，固應從經濟本身着想，但如果由此而懷疑到政府所執行的新經濟政策，或懷疑到對一般奸商的嚴厲的懲創，這無異是對奸商的辯護，結果仍是讓奸商肆行無憚，使政府的政策無法執行了。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>上海的經濟管制工作，已經進行三星期了，在這三星期中，因爲政府的政策得到人民的擁護，以致平定了物價，樹立了金圓券的信用，這應歸功於上海大多數的人民。在發行金圓券的第二天，有一部份的奸商，出來企岡破壞八一九的限價，藉以動搖政府的信用，大家應還記得，那幾天四五千個棉紗投機商人，擠在市塲裏面，想拿游資來收購棉紗布，衝破限定的價格，我們已用政府的力量，將他平定下去了，後來正式交易所雖然停止營業，但仍有許多人在塲外進行買賣，企圖搗亂市塲，我們又用强大的力量封閉了幾家大的證券字號，拘捕了最有力量的經紀人，始將這次風彼平定。自此以後，居然尙有人做着金鈔黑市，然我們亦終於將這破壞政府金圓券信用的敗類，加以撲滅。現在攏在我們限前的現象，就是銀行存款增加利息已减低了，房地產價格也提高了，這證明上海經濟生活已開始經常化了。這種現象，對於人民和正當商人，是均有利益的，這也就是我們追求的目的。但這對於一般奸商，是最不利的，他們希望市塲愈亂愈好，因爲從混亂的狀况中，他們就好獲得大量的厚利。</p>
<p>目前上海總算是尙稱安定，但這是不是說以後絕無問題呢？不是的前面我們所見到的，幷不是江平浪靜，月白風淸的美麗景緻，而是隱藏驚狂風暴雨，烏雲密佈的危險前途，這是我們所預料得到的。我們幷不畏懼，只要堅決勇敢，這種風暴是一定要過去的。希望上海的市民，不要搖動，下決心來消滅這一切惡勢力，我在這裏要預先指出的，現在大的奸商，雖然蔡閉的已禁閉起來了，判死刑的已判死刑了，但他們的勢力幷未消滅，因此我們對於過去短短時間內的工作，決不能抱絲毫滿足的意思，更不可因爲受到了人民的稱贊而驕傲，以致忘了今後更艱巨的鬭爭。最近三星期的工作，只不過是來日長期鬭爭的第一步，在上海的靑年朋友，萬不可抱一種痛快主義，痛快不過是一時的，是不能持久的。今天我們所需要的，不是一時的痛快，而是要我們看得遠，站得穩，打得準。只有這樣，我們才有希望，我們要硬幹而不可蠻幹，要快幹而不可瞎幹，要實幹而不可亂幹，（二）幹是無理性，瞎幹是無計劃，亂幹是無步驟；相反的，我們是要有理性的，有計劃的，有步驟的去幹。（下轉第五版）</p>

<h3>上海往何處去？</h3>
<p>— 蔣經國</p>
<p>（上接第四版）自從將大奸商送入法院，將囤積物資充公以後，有一部份的人說這是不民主，幷說蔣經國是强盜，許多人以爲我可駡你，你不能駡我，我可打你，你不能打我，我要怎樣就可以怎樣爲民主，這是一個大的錯誤。什麼是民主呢？民主就是站在大多數人民的利益上，拿大多教人民的力量來壓倒少數人力量，這就是民主，至於說誰是强盜，那到是一個問題。比如舉榮鴻元作例來說：他的財產究有多少，恐怕他自己也很難計算，聽說他最近在虹橋路修大花園，蓋大洋房，還有人說半個無錫是屬於榮家的。又比如舉韋伯祥作例來說：他的財產，就有幾百萬美元，這樣在他們的手上一舉一動，就有千萬人的生命以致餓死，他們的財產洋房是建築在人民骷髏上，這種行爲，難道有異於强盜嗎？政府現在決定沒收囤積居奇的貨物，是因爲投機家將貨物當作擾亂金融，操縱市塲的工具，而並非以供應布塲爲目的，我們所要沒收的，不是所有的貨物，而只是囤積的貨物。對於正當工商業的財產，不但不加以絲毫的損害，幷應加以保護。政府決定將所沒收的貨物，完全變賣，將所賣的錢，來作救濟事業。到底誰是强盜，大家一望，卽可明白知道。所奇怪的，今天居然有人出來爲强盜辯護，這類人的良心，眞不知到何處去了。難道未曾看見飢寒交迫，呻吟憔悴的窮苦百姓嗎？他們是在過着如何痛苦的生活，爲什麽你們要爲吸血的强盜辯護，而不爲貧苦無吿的貧民說話呢？</p>
<p>上海的商人，受了百餘年來海派作風的影響，很多人早已忘記了商業的道德。他們所看到的，第一是錢，第二是錢，第三還是錢，但是現在的時代，已不是過去的時代了。現在的時代，是民主的時代，人民的時代，在這個時代中，任何人在國家法律前應一律平等，但在道義上，我們應同情於大多數的貧苦的人民。</p>
<p>我們在這裏不能詳細說明我們工作的作風，但有幾件事，我須向大家說一說：最近「打老虎」這句話，已成了上海流行的名詞，但所謂「打老虎」，這究是個人英維主義，我們今日所需要的，乃是發動民衆，組織民衆，來與惡勢力奮鬥到底。此外，最近還有人呌出「靑天」二字來，這也是我們中國老百姓傳統的錯誤觀念，自己不以主人自居，不知道國家的官吏爲他們解除痛苦是份內的事情，自己是主人，官吏是當差，我自己年輕，學識淺陋，但只抱着爲人民服務的精神，來做自己所應做的事情，我願意做上海百姓的當差。一個人不做事則已，做事一定是有錯誤的，望大家監督我，糾正我，祗有道樣，才能完成這艱巨的任務。</p>
<p>上海許多商人，其所以能發財的道理，是由於他們擁有本店自造的兩個武器：一是造謠欺騙，一是勾結貪官汚吏，做官的人如與商人勾結，政府將要加倍懲辦。戚再玉已經槍斃了，聴說不久將來，還有類似的人也要得到同樣的命運，這就是對於身爲官吏的人的警吿。至於造謠欺騙一點，這是上海許多商人的天才，他們從無中生有，破壞政府，動搖民心，希望不要中他們的謠言，受他們的欺騙，應對他們施以無情的打擊。我們今天在上海，看不見砲火，聽不見槍聲，但我們不應忘記前方的戰士，正在與共匪作戰，他們爲的是保全國家的統一獨立，人民的生命財產，共匪和奸商是革命的兩大敵人，我們對於這兩個，決不能放鬆一個，要同樣的打，一起的打。</p>
<p>最後，我要對我們靑年軍說幾句話：我們靑年軍是在我們最高領袖領導下組織起來的，過去在抗戰的時期，有過光榮的歷史，現在在戡亂的時期亦有輝煌的成績，我們有的已經復員，有的還留在部隊，留在前方部隊的，固然是要執行作戰的任務，但是復員在後方的，亦應從事於經濟戡亂的工作，須知我們在經濟戰塲中所負的任務，與前方共匪作戰是同等的重要，靑年軍應該有最大的勇氣來從事這一艱巨而有歷史意義的偉大工作。（全文完）</p>

<p>滬漢兩區先行設立</p>
<p>〔又訊〕棉紗執行八一九限價後，當局及各紗廠咸感原料價格，應予合理之控制，以維持成品與原料之新價，而使棉紗限價能維繋不墜。本此目的，當局刻已決定設置國棉聯購委員會，由中央銀行國民營紗廠各推代表一人組織之。該會決在滬設立圍棉聯購處，俾執行聯合採購原棉之業務。並決在漢口設立分處，其他各地，視需要再行分設機構。</p>

<p>塲內交易，以十支二十支粗紗較夥，喊價均在限度內步步下瀉，各檔細紗供售頗多，複製業吸納尙佳，市盤平穩。廿一支雙馬跌至七百五十元，比上日續瀉廿七元之鉅。二十支以下亦帶落五六元至十元不等，粗紗在限價下二十元左右有成交。</p>

<p>麵粉</p>
<p>續見微挫，實銷稀少，內地銷路停頓，故走銷至感呆木，僅有零星交易。老車粉七元五角，計降五分，兵船粉挫三分，建成跌三分，雜牌粉均跌三五分不等。麩皮續降三分，小麥仍爲十元零三角原盤。　雜糧</p>
<p>仍走疲途，客胃呆滯，實銷依然不振。黃豆本街以新豆銷路較好，價尙站住，車豆及乍豆因廠胃不佳，再降三五角。車豆最後十一元三角，苞米北帮胃淡，下降二三角。元麥仍只少數交易。荼豆開極少，紅糧因有汕頭厦門帮納進，挺升三角。芝蔴疲五角，生仁仿不開出。</p>

<h3>洋莊茶穩定</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，仍在輸出商熱烈搜風中，過程頗見活躍，惜因貨稀供缺，成交依然式微，價格方面，迭吐秀氣脚地亦頗鞏固。</p>
<p>茲悉：本市華商出口行，爲積極展開華茶直接外銷起見，除致函歐地外，同時彙集貨樣，寄往國外，俾資推銷。並聞中航公司於本月十六日，將有專機直飛非洲，而茶葉同業，均在準備大批屯綠抽珍珍眉等貨樣，寄往彼地。至於內銷茶，邇以進出相埒，迄鮮軒輊。</p>

<h3>李熙謀致函公私校敎職員　擴充清寒免費額　勿斤斤學費待遇失學與我風馬牛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市教局代局長李熙謀爲學生申請减免費問題，貫澈執行市參議會決議起見，昨特發表致全市公私立中小學校長曁敎職員公開函一件。文略稱：</p>
<p>邇來社會輿論，對於少數學校超收學雜費頗多非議；學生申請减免費者，又每遭敎師拒絕或斥責，尤引起一般家長之憤慨。查减免費名額之規定，係市參議會所議決，市政府及本局僅爲是項議決案之執行機構</p>
<p>歪曲觀念亟應糾正</p>
<p>每學期核定收費標准時，估計學校經費收入，對减免費學生名額已予减除。故各校按照規定標準設置减免費名額，決不影響敎職員待遇。本市私立各校敎師，輒以爲增加一名免費生，卽减少若千收入，校長亦有以此蒙蔽敎師者。此種歪曲觀念亟應糾正，庶敎師對免費學生不加仇視。此其一。</p>
<p>無限摭充免費名額</p>
<p>私立學校對於收費標準都主張不予限制，本局在原則上，原表同情，但先決條件，在淸寒學生不會因學費太高而失學。欲達成此目的，私立學校必須無限制擴充免費名額。若高學費造成失學之威脅，一日不解除，學校敎師厭惡擴充免費名額之態度，一日不改變；則私校無限制收費，在現在一般人民經濟力量之情形下，確有造成大景失學之危險。此其二。</p>
<p>體念時艱多寄同情</p>
<p>茲者學期業已開始，清賽學生爲學費驚措困難頗多，徬徨歧途，情殊可憫。本局爲貫澈執行市參議會決議起見，對於淸寒學生請求免費者，不論學生自向學校直接申請，或本局轉函通知，除非經學校考核證明，確非淸寒者外，本局必力予協助，務使得享免費待遇，以免失學。各校校長敎師亦應體念時艱，對淸寒學生多寄同情，不得藉詞推諉，或僞稱額滿拒絕接受。此其三。</p>
<p>有一失學敎界之責</p>
<p>總之，學校所以作育靑年，有一失學，卽是敎界之責。一自行束修以上，我未嘗無誨焉」是孔子敎育驚神。斤斤於學費之高下，待遇之豐厚，視靑年失學問題，若與我風馬牛不相及，決非我敎育界應有之態度。願我公私立學較校長敎飾諸君，與本局共戒共勉焉。</p>
<h3>程其保任聯敎處長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕我聯敎組織中國委會秘書程其保，被國際聯敎組織聘爲敎育處長。程氏定本月底或下月初赴巴黎就職。</p>
<h3>獎學金待名冊核發　統審委會總幹事發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據上海市奬學金統一審核委員會總幹事鄭傑稱：近來間有各校學生致函本會，請求提前發放本學期獎學金，本會對於此項意見，深表同情。但事實上欲提平獎學金發放日期，必須各校當局能提早造送本學期免費生名冊，否則本會將無法提前審核。蓋本會舉辦獎學金之最大目的，在鼓勵各校儘量收容免費學生，使能達到市參議會規定之免費額（私立中學百分之二十，私立小學百分之二十五），俾全市淸寒學生均能得到適當之救濟。故在各校未造送免費生名冊之前，本會若卽將獎學金提前發放，則不但失去本會舉辦獎學金之原意，且無異將獎學金送給一般免費不是額之學校。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談書</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>最近在本刊上常見到關於書的文章，曝書也，失書也，賣書也，然獨少見有人談買書，足見今日文人生活的淸苦，普遍皆然。雖然常為本刊執筆諸君，很少有職業文人（我猜想如此），然此點無非更一層設明一般潔身日好之士的生活苦難。在戰前，買幾本「現代叢書」或其他單行本，究竟並非甚麼難事。當時美金」圓，僅合三元，目前改了金圓券後，雖亦僅為一與四之比，可是一般薪給者的收入，却遠非戰前可比了。</p>
<p>像我個人，雖有固定的職業，但對書店則已屢屢過門不入。所幸尙有一些存書，如果一一閱讀，也還有好幾年好消遺。道不得不感謝自已過去經濟優尙裕時期動跑書店的結果，終算今日尙能留着兩架書為寒舍稍事點綴。</p>
<p>我過去雖喜買書，然並無藏書的癖好，因此歷來失散的書較之現有的幾十冊來，實數倍之。而今想來，深感可惜。甚至連自已數年來少數寫作與翻譯的册子，竟亦沒有留下幾種。不過我常認為任何東西終是身外物，智識尤應是大衆的東西，個人藏書而成癖好，祗能看做是一種病態的佔有慾。試問一個人臟了數千百册書，終其身豈能消化得了？不過在公衆圖書館尙未普遍之前，私人藏書亦自有其保障文物的價値，但若將藏書看做是私人財產，則就失掉了這種意義</p>
<p>我對於書的觀念旣是如此，所以買書亦向來不大喜歡買其一個人的全集。甚至有時單買了上册或下冊。這也許有人認為可笑。但我的意見是，一個人的生涯有限，普天下的書怎麼看得了？而且不論怎樣了不起的作家，其著作也不一定是本本値得看的。除非專門致志於一家一派的思想與學識，則捧着其一人的全集，究竟也無聊得很吧</p>
<p>當然，全集之類的東西，卽使不是專門研究這一行的，也自有其參考的價値。可是說起參考，就使人聯想到讀書的功利觀念來了。大概擅長做參考工作的人，讀書必有目的，例如帮助自已的著作，敎材，以及研究等等。讀書而有目的，雖不可一概否定，然終是屬於形而下的一類。書與書所啓發的智識，在此塲合祗是達到一定目的的工具，而失去了精神上的享受。而我個人則認為書對於人的可貴處，正就是這種精神上的享受。</p>
<p>然而為了生活的逼迫，作為精神李受的讀書機會，是一天少一天了，甚至弄到買一本雜誌，先存着是否可供寫作材料或翻譯文章的念頭。此情此景，實在是可恨亦復可憐。有人曾說過一著書原為稻梁謀」的話，但想不到今日就連看書也不得下與戶口米的念頭聯繁在一起！</p>
<p>我不敢妄想讀書人應該自恃淸高。一個人欲取之於社會，亦必須有所貢獻於社會，這才是合理，才是公平。所以卽使將讀書與功利觀念聯繫起來，亦沒有甚麼可羞的地方。何况我們」向就相信書中自有「黃金屋」，「千鍾粟」，和「顏如玉」的說法；科舉時代的士大夫，，更將「學而優則仕」認為天經地義。然而人在物質生活之外，如果再有滿足自我的精神要求，亦不能說是苛求吧？</p>
<p>不過，這在今日等於夢麼。我的桌上就放着一篇自「紐約泰晤士報」上剪下來待「派用塲」的文章。文字旣已變了奴役自已的鞭子，讀書還有甚麼樂趣與享受可言哉！</p>
<h3>酒樓</h3>
<p>— 夢秋</p>
<p>酒樓中，看見了分手十年的老友。</p>
<p>誠然是快事，然而再要像十年前一般毫無保留地暢談，旁若無人似的大笑，却竟然不易。除了最陳套的寒喧以外，簡直沒有什麼話可說。</p>
<p>十年中學到的「世故」，彷彿祗有一句話：不要碰痛了別人。因之，卽使是實在大家相知得很深而且天天渴想一見的人，見了倒像是兩個拳鬥的好手，鈴聲饗後，大家試探了再試探，廻避了再廻避，深具戒心。偶然像蜻蜓點水那麼一「點」，也祗有一「點」而已，接着就把話題岔得老遠。　不　　，　就沾唇而止。</p>
<p>我不禁痛心地想：老X，這一次可是完了，我們算是白認識了一傷！</p>
<p>忽然，他用悠閒的口氣告訴我，H君在抗戰中死了，他參加的部隊竟然中了敵人的毒計，犧牲得相當慘重。我眼前浮現了精明幹練的H的面容。這樣一個第一流的人才！</p>
<p>我默默飲酒，忘記了自已還在上海的一家酒樓中。忽然抬起頭來，却看見他也正瞧着我。</p>
<p>演戲的時候太多了；卽使盒下了面具，他也還是以為我在演戲。</p>
<p>祗有讓「時間」來解釋一切了。</p>
<h3>浴缸</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>美國第一隻浴缸是在一八二〇年由英國運去的，那隻浴缸的形式如何，無從稽老。但許多人都以為是一種新奇的東西，牠的主人惠德奈就將那浴缸陳列在前園，任人參觀。在一八四二年，有一個做棉花五榖經理人的湯姆生最先在他的家中裝置浴缸。他在一八四二年十二月二十日邀請了許多賓客到他的家裏去吃飯，繼以沐浴。到了明天，各大日報大加攻擊，以為就浴缸沐浴有礙身體健康。一般醫生，也堅持着他們的成見，說在浴缸裏沐浴足以發生風濕肺炎等症。也有許多人提議禁止使用浴缸，主張凡家中有浴缸的，一律課稅每年三十元。</p>
<h3>雲間白蕉大字歌</h3>
<p>— 沈禹鐘</p>
<p>我讚叔範詩，能狀雲間奇。（叔範贈白蕉詩盛稱其書畫）　間本詩人，工畫盡其池。普庸名筆萃君腕，正法可起書道衰，書家豪傑不世出，乃知王氣今在斯。鍾王書體落凡手，跬步侷促難驅馳，紛紛俗論坐相襲，遂使祖法蒙瑕疵。觀君大字縱揮灑，羣丈巨輻隨所之，自是筆力裏元氣，爐冶在手無不實。年來兵革苦未已，寸管無計收瘀　，酒邊燈下集憂憤，伸紙想見神來時。書生用意世誰會，堆墻退筆君何為！</p>
<h3>詩人易哭痷</h3>
<p>— 陳左高</p>
<p>龍陽易哭庵先生，詩才久鳴，游揚雛姬諸作，尤靡麗絕倫。桐城方重審丈，曾友其人於舊京流水音，交誼頗深，謂哭庵詩詞，恒成於床上厠上車上，或仰臥構思，或　藩著筆，或　軾得句，岡不瞬息立就，捷逾子建，因有「三上」之稱。</p>

<h3>關於葛羅米柯</h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>近從報上讀到美國援華經濟合作署中國分署長賴樸翰夫人，乘飛機自美國來滬與其丈夫團聚的消息。賴夫人精神矍鑠，相夫有方，在美國社交界中頗負盛名。某日，蘇聯外次前駐聯合國代表葛羅米柯在一次宴會中與賴樸翰夫人相値。賴夫人向他問道：「閣下對於美國女人作何感想？」葛羅米柯臉無笑容的答道：「對我毫無印象」。賴夫人見話不投機，正欲轉身他去，不想葛羅米柯却馬上解釋道：「賴僕翰太太，我是跟你說笑話的。」</p>
<p>此外，美國新聞界中還流傳若干葛羅米柯的幽默談吐。例如</p>
<p>有人問他對於紐約時報所刊關於他的一篇特稿，有何意見。他答稱，其中一半屬實，一半出於虛構，因為紐約時報是一張中庸的報紙，此項報導自在意料之中。</p>
<p>他聽到人家提及他的少年時代，便反問道：「在美國要活上多少年才算『上年紀」呢？」</p>
<p>某美國記者有一次打電話到他的家中去，由他的女兒接聽。新聞記者請她的父親接電話。她答道。「不在家。」</p>

<h3>擊毬</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>韓愈　張建封擊毬，有贈張　射討。擊毬乃軍中習戰之戲，尤足以練騎術；其法不詳，然必馳馬逐毬，擊以杖，毬體不大，而甚堅實。今西人有馬毬之戲，不知視我古法同異如何。全國運動會中無馬毬，蓋固有之技藝早已失傳，效法他人亦有偏好，讀韓氏詩，猶可想見唐人之英風耳。詩云，「築塲千步平如削，短垣三面繚逶迤，此言毬塲。云」百馬攢蹄近相映，毬驚杖奮合且離，「又，一側身轉臂著馬腹，霹靈應手神珠馳，」擊法大略如此。其上張僕射第二書云，「今之言毬之害者，必日有危陸之憂，有激射之虞，小者傷面目，大者殘形軀，」又，「以之（指馬）馳毬於塲，蕩搖其心腑，振　其筋骨，氣不及出入，走不及迥旋，遠者三四年，近者一二年，無全馬矣，然則毬之害於人也決矣。此眞古讀書人之見，凡競技必有小害於人，若見其小害而不見其大利，遂謂體育遊戲當廢，實為無識。然運動宜戒過度，其論馬之說是也，今英國人作此戲，人須備馬三四匹，約十五分鐘易馬一次</p>
<h3>交通安全運動借鏡</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>上海市政當局道幾天又在提倡交通安全運動，一年一度的「交通安全週」已有數年歷史，但是，雖不能說完全是一種點級，所收的效果却與預期相差甚遠。熱鬧區域交通阻塞如故，車輛肇禍依然時有所聞，這些都是急須改進和作更火的努力的。美國小城伊儿斯東在以前也是一個交通阻塞的城市，這個人口祗有七萬的小城，因爲鄰近支加哥的緣故，交通的繫忙竟如一個擁有五十萬人口的大都市。但是經過由站崗的交通警察出身的福蘭克林克立姆的努力，伊城在一九四五年竟能未曾發生一件車輛傷人致死的案件。並且在四年中有三年獲得「國家安全會議」的獎賞，被認為同面積的城市中的最安全者。</p>
<p>克立姆的第一步工作是任命一位有資結的專家為「交通工程師」，全日聚精會神於角快交通　塞問題。</p>
<p>他首先說服大馬路上的商人，在午夜與淸晨六時之間進行載貨和卸貨的工作，因為在白天載卸貨物是妨礙交通的一大主因。商人們聽從了，交通的情形隨卽有顯著的改進</p>
<p>第二步，克氏籲求僱主們的合作，將放工的時間分別先後而不要在同一的時間大家一同放工。這樣，在放工時所發生的交通擁擠的高潮便被削弱了。</p>
<p>對於行人，為了安全起見，警察用擴音機有禮的勸阻他們穿過紅燈，斜角的穿越十字路口，或者在馬路的中段越到對街。</p>
<p>在十字路口，邊石都成圓形，使司機得以較易和較快的轉灣。有幾條馬路被限定僅通單程交通，使交通的容量和速度都得以增加。</p>
<p>紅綠燈的變換都使其時刻相合，以每小時二十七哩的速度行駛的車子，在每一個十字路口都會遇到綠燈。狹窄的街道僅可在單邊停車，在交通頻繁的區域，則停車時間由一小時或一小時半减少到半小時。</p>
<p>如今克氏已成了大學「敎授」，他是西北大學交通學院的院長。畢業生近兩千名之多，分佈在美國各州和中美洲及加拿大等地，專門負責解決交通問題。</p>

<h3>Import Quota for the Seventh and Eighth Quarters Reduced by Nearly 20 Million US Dollars; To Be Reported to the Executive Yuan Meeting and Then Announced; Exchange Rate for British Pounds and French Francs to Be Considered After Agreement is Reached</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan held its fourth meeting at 4 PM on the 14th at the No. 1 official residence of the Executive Yuan. Committee members present included Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, and Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan. Yu Dawei, Guan Jiyu, Sun Yueqi, Gu Zhenggang, and Li Weiguo, heads of relevant ministries and commissions, also attended. The meeting was personally presided over by Weng Wenhao, who also served as the chairman. First, the secretariat reported on the implementation of price controls and financial management in various regions. Then, Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian reported on the supply and pricing of coal. The meeting then proceeded to discuss (1) the import quota for the seventh and eighth quarters; (2) the issue of exchanging British pounds and other foreign currencies. According to the Ministry of Finance's report, the Central Bank is currently studying this issue. Except for US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and Philippine pesos, which can be exchanged for gold yuan at the Central Bank, holders of British pounds, French francs, and rubles can first deposit them in the Central Bank or its entrusted banks, which will store and manage them on behalf of the holders. The Central Bank will issue storage certificates. After the Central Bank reaches an agreement with Britain, France, and other countries on the exchange rate in the future, the currencies can be exchanged or used to purchase raw materials that are permitted for import. (3) Regarding the food supply issue, the rationing system for major cities will be reconsidered. In particular, the preferential treatment given to wealthy households in large cities with the ability to obtain rations should be reconsidered and improved. Guan Jiyu reported at the meeting that the food supply situation in various cities is very good, and the sources of grain in various regions have become abundant after the new grain has been harvested.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The import quota list for the seventh and eighth quarters has been approved at the meeting of the Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan on the afternoon of the 14th. It will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th for a report and then announced in the afternoon. The import quota list for the seventh and eighth quarters approved by the Economic Control Committee on the 14th is based on Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the "Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Control," and has been reduced by more than one-quarter compared to the average standard of the fifth and sixth quarters. The total import quota for the fifth and sixth quarters was 73,476,000 US dollars, while the total amount for the seventh and eighth quarters is only over 50 million US dollars, a decrease of nearly 20 million US dollars. The compilation of this quota list is purely to save the country's foreign exchange, and it adopts a combined compilation method, which is the same as the intention of the combined compilation of the fifth and sixth quarters. The list of items listed in Appendix (2) of the quota list has been reduced from 21 items in the fifth and sixth quarters to 19 items in the seventh and eighth quarters. The originally listed truck and automobile items have been deleted to avoid increasing gasoline consumption. The import of other items has been generally reduced by 25%. In addition to approving the detailed numbers of the quota list at the meeting, the following three points were also decided: (1) For machinery, industrial accessories, and industrial raw materials that domestic manufacturers have ordered abroad before August 19 and are permitted to import, the Export Control Committee will be responsible for formulating measures to register them on a regular basis and allow them to apply for import. (2) For foreign merchants in China, if they use their own funds to purchase machinery and parts from abroad that are indeed for private assembly and use, they may be allowed to import them on a regular basis. (3) The import of 500 to 600 automobiles by foreign merchants will be handled separately.</p>
<h3>Review of Compensation Standards for Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry; The Legislative Yuan Passes a Resolution Urging the Speedy Establishment of Hainan Province; The "July 5th" Provisional Martial Law Case in Peiping is Not Ratified</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The second meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 14th. After the meeting was presided over by President Sun at 9:30 AM, the reporting items were first conducted. In addition to passing the minutes of the first meeting and resolving to reject the Executive Yuan's request for ratification of the temporary martial law declared in the Peiping area on July 5th, 17 cases submitted by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan were also processed. Then, the discussion items began: The first case was the report of the review of the draft Military Pension Regulations by the National Defense Committee and the Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan. Because the content of the draft needs to be changed again after the currency reform, the Ministry of National Defense stated in a letter, it was decided to postpone the discussion until it is revised and reviewed again. The second case was the proposal by Kong Geng and others "to re-examine and revise the compensation standards for pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry, which were approved by the previous Legislative Yuan, in order to be fair, alleviate public resentment, completely end this case, and avoid causing trouble." It was resolved to hand it over to the Civil Law Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee for joint review, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. The meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. President Sun requested leave due to illness, and Committee Member Luo Heng was publicly elected as chairman to continue the discussion items. The third case was the proposal by Qiu Changwei and others to amend the rules of procedure of the Legislative Yuan, which was resolved to be handed over to the Legal System Committee for review. The fourth case was the proposal by Zhang Qingzhen and others to urge the Executive Yuan to formulate and implement detailed measures for the registration and management of foreign exchange assets deposited abroad by Chinese citizens, in order to effectively implement the proposal, which was resolved to be handed over to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee for joint review. The fifth case was the report of the joint review by the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee and the National Defense Committee of the proposal by Wang Jun and others to urge the government to implement the resolution and quickly change Hainan Island into a province, which was resolved to pass the "Hainan Island Province Change Case should be implemented immediately" according to the review opinions. The sixth case was the joint review by the Grain Administration Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee of the three proposals related to grain administration proposed by Sun Xiangfeng and others, Liu Yunzhao and others, and Qu Zhisheng and others, which was resolved to be passed according to the review opinions. Except for the Qu case, which involves a major change in grain policy due to the establishment of a grain depot system, which needs to be discussed at length during this session, the Sun and Liu cases are combined and decided on two points: "(1) The purchase of county-level grain taxes should be paid monthly at the market price from the time of ordering, and the funds should be allocated before the 10th of each month, and the allocation procedures should be simplified as much as possible. The detailed measures shall be decided by the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Treasury Bureau through consultation. (2) The transportation of purchased grain taxes shall be the responsibility of the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of National Defense." The seventh case was the proposal by Niu Jianchu and others that land reform policies in pacification areas and non-pacification areas should be implemented simultaneously and universally in order to conform to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of equalizing land ownership and benefit the suppression of rebellion and nation-building cause, which was resolved to be handed over to the Land Administration Committee and the Legal System Committee for joint review and to be merged with the "Land Handling Regulations for Pacification Areas" submitted by the Executive Yuan. By 6:00 PM, all the agenda items were completed, and the adjournment was announced.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Cables to the Hubei Provincial Assembly</h3>
<p>Conscription and Borrowing Permitted to Be Postponed by One-Fifth</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 14th] President Chiang recently replied to the Hubei Provincial Assembly by cable, approving the request of the Assembly to exempt this year's conscription and borrowing of actual goods, and approving the postponement of one-fifth of the conscription portion according to the original quota, but the conscription of actual goods portion should still be levied according to the original amount.</p>
<h3>Adding Alcohol to Vehicle Fuel; To Be Piloted in Shanghai First</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] In order to save gasoline, the Executive Yuan recently convened the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Transportation Control Committee, and the China Petroleum Corporation and other agencies to discuss the oil material control and adjustment plan. At the meeting, many attendees suggested that vehicles use fuel mixed with alcohol due to the insufficient supply of imported fuel. The meeting decided that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Resources Commission should jointly discuss the technical issues. Now the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has invited relevant ministries to discuss, and the result has been decided to mix alcohol with automobile fuel, which will be piloted in Shanghai first. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will submit it to the Executive Yuan and then to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure for mixing alcohol with automobile fuel.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Exercises the Power of Veto; The Discussion on the "July 5th" Martial Law Case Was Heated</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Legislative Yuan exercised the power of veto granted by the Constitution for the first time on the morning of the 14th, refusing to ratify President's July 26th request for ratification of the July 5th Peiping martial law case. The first reporting case listed on today's meeting agenda was: "The President consults on the declaration of temporary martial law in the Peiping area from 7:00 PM on the 5th of this month (July 5th), please review and ratify the case." President Sun suggested that after all the reporting cases have been read, the discussion should be conducted directly in accordance with Article 8 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law. Wang Hansheng, a legislator from Songjiang Province, spoke first. Based on the investigation report of Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui, he pointed out that the reasons for the temporary martial law listed in the report form of the Ministry of National Defense and the original telegram of Fu Zuoyi did not match the facts. The Supervisory Yuan is planning to exercise its powers over the government's measures to handle the July 5th incident. If the Legislative Yuan ratifies it, it is tantamount to admitting that the government's measures are legitimate. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the President has the power to declare martial law, but the power of ratification rests with the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan ratifies it without asking the details, it is tantamount to abandoning its power and neglecting its duties. Wang's speech immediately received applause. Then, Liu Zhendong, Huang Yuren, Sun Guiji, Cheng Tianfang, Liu Minghou, Zhang Qianhua and others spoke in succession, either proposing that the case be reserved, or proposing to change the agenda, and wait for the Supervisory Yuan to make a decision on the July 5th incident before discussing it again, but the majority advocated that the decision on whether or not to ratify it should be made immediately based on facts and law. After an hour of heated discussion, President Sun asked for the consent of the attendees to first vote on whether to send it to the review. As a result, among the 306 committee members present, 121 opposed it, and 108 supported it, neither of which exceeded half of the votes. At this point, the vote was taken again on whether to ratify it. As a result, only two people voted in favor of ratification, and another person raised his hand between yes and no. President Sun declared: "The President consulted on the declaration of temporary martial law in the Peiping area from July 5th, please review and ratify the case, the resolution is not to ratify it." This topic ended amidst applause.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] An authoritative source said: The "July 5th" martial law measure in Peiping was decided by the Peiping Garrison Headquarters and approved by the Executive Yuan meeting. The President only submitted the report from the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for review and ratification. Now that the Legislative Yuan has refused to ratify it because the reasons for the measure are insufficient, the President will naturally report it back and order the Executive Yuan to re-examine and handle it. Whether the martial law measure is inappropriate, or whether the officials who decided and implemented the measure will be subject to administrative punishment, still depends on whether the Supervisory Yuan decides to exercise its power of correction and impeachment. The Legislative Yuan's decision not to ratify the measure means that it cannot obtain a legal basis before the Supervisory Yuan decides what steps to take.</p>

<h3>At the Welcome Meeting of Peiping City Councilors; Zhang Lisheng Spoke Eloquently; Discussing His Personality and Style, He Admitted to Being Weak; Learning from Muhammad, He Held a Sword in One Hand</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 14th] Zhang Lisheng spoke eloquently at the welcome meeting of Peiping City Councilors on the 14th, discussing his personality and style. Because City Councilor Shen Chengqing accused Zhang of being too kind in guiding the financial and economic reforms in the north, and not approaching the people much. He pointed out that Zhang's statement that Peiping and Tianjin are different from Shanghai and do not need to be too strict is unclear responsibility, and hoped that Zhang would review the past and encourage the future. Zhang solemnly replied to this, saying: Most people today are flattering, and such loyal words are rarely seen even between teachers and friends, and he will never forget them in his life. He continued: I dare not say that I am kind, I can only say that I am weak. The reason why I cannot be brave is because I cannot be kind. Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the three great virtues. The reason why "wisdom" comes first is that it is valuable to know before acting. As the saying goes, "Heavy punishment is used to govern a chaotic world." I don't want to say more about this kind of imperial privilege. Today, we want democracy. The government cannot abuse its power and should punish according to the law. I am a northerner, and I know that Peiping and Tianjin have been exploited by the enemy and puppets for eight years. There are indeed some rich people, but most people are suffering from poverty. If we act rashly, it will not be good. Hating evil is my nature, but I can only learn from Muhammad, holding the Quran in one hand and a sword in the other. Zhang also told reporters before leaving that today's situation is rare, and I hope you will write more.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 14th] Peiping City Councilors held a tea party today to welcome Zhang Lisheng, and Mayor Liu and others accompanied him. City Councilors explained their opinions on financial and economic reforms. Gu Danhua put forward ten points, one of which stated that 125 pieces of cloth were found in Caoduo Hutong, and 500 bags of rice were found in a factory. Whereabouts are unknown. Director Wen of the Social Affairs Bureau replied that someone had admitted to the cloth and is now asking the Suppression Headquarters for instructions. The rice is also being negotiated with the supply area headquarters. The government is not afraid of power.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange of Hecheng, Meifeng and Other Banks Must Be Reported Again</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Responding to the National Construction Through Thrift and Diligence Movement</h3>
<p>The ancients said that thrift and diligence build a family. From establishing a family and starting a career to governing a country and prospering a nation, everything starts with these two words. Diligence means working hard, and thrift means abstaining from waste. The purpose of diligence is to increase income, and the effect of thrift is to reduce expenditure. With both root and branch addressed, and simultaneous efforts on both the active and passive fronts, how can a family be not well-managed, and a country not thrive?</p>
<p>However, since the opening of sea routes, extravagant Western customs have gradually spread eastward. Our people abandon the old for the new, influenced by what they see and hear, developing a Westernized style. They only know how to enjoy, not how to produce; they value pleasure, not accumulation, leading to years of trade deficits and the decline of national power. If this situation continues, even without natural disasters, man-made calamities, internal worries, and external threats, the nation's vitality will be exhausted, reaching a point where it cannot be sustained. Moreover, after ten years of military campaigns and rampant inflation, the general population, in addition to saving the dying and helping the wounded, knows that saving for future use is not as good as enjoying the moment. Therefore, they spend freely, caring only for the present, unaware of the concept of savings. The decline of rural areas and the sharp decrease in bank deposits have long caused us to worry about the future of the national economy!</p>
<p>Now, the central authorities, to coordinate economic reform measures, are reportedly considering a movement for national construction through thrift and diligence, the guidelines of which were published in yesterday's newspaper. Superficially, this may seem like an old chestnut, lacking novel significance. However, to become wealthy and strong, and cultivate the foundation of the nation, we must start with this fundamental work. Everyone knows that increasing production should be the basis of all economic reforms, but without the entire nation working hard and intensifying efforts, the goal of increased production cannot be achieved. As for simultaneously advancing Chinese-style production and Western-style enjoyment, production and sales will inevitably become disconnected, and income and expenditure will become increasingly imbalanced. Everyone knows that this is the fatal wound of our country's socio-economy today! Mr. Jiang Baili once said, "A country whose living conditions are separated from combat conditions will surely perish." We can adapt his saying and say that a country whose spending habits are separated from production methods will surely be poor. Therefore, the two words "thrift and diligence" cannot be ignored at any time, but they are especially urgent at this moment.</p>
<p>Take Britain as an example. After the Second European War, although its national strength was far less than before due to excessive consumption, its industry was developed, exports were booming, and its national income and expenditure had a huge surplus last year. In terms of consumption, it still maintains very strict rationing. In terms of work, even women are still subject to national control. It can truly be said that no land is left uncultivated, and no person is left idle. In our country, where both the public and private sectors are struggling and universally poor, shouldn't we be even more vigilant?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, inflation and the loss of the currency's ability to store value is undoubtedly a factor promoting waste. Therefore, when the currency value is depreciating step by step and prices are rising day by day, it is indeed not easy to require savings and interest accrual to preserve the general surplus purchasing power. However, after the currency reform, the situation is clearly different. Because the restriction of similar practices is strictly enforced everywhere, and hoarding is strictly prohibited at the same time, prices are expected to stabilize in the future, and the currency value is no longer in danger of falling. Moreover, the gold yuan is publicly issued and has a fixed maximum issuance amount to restrict it, so there is no need to worry about it being too inflated. Therefore, in our recent article on increasing the capital of banks and savings, we mentioned encouraging savings. This is because the possibility of implementing savings in the future environment is indeed much higher than before. Now, the central government is strengthening thrift and simultaneously promoting the national construction movement through thrift and diligence, presumably also to use this favorable environment to re-cultivate national strength.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in China has always been top-down. As the saying goes, the virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, and the virtue of a small man is like grass; the wind on the grass will surely bend it. Therefore, after this movement unfolds, in addition to hoping that all sectors of society respond in unison, we also hope that the general adults and gentlemen will lead by example, setting an example for the people. In the past, the national goods movement was repeatedly promulgated in official documents, and the authorities may have had the sincerity to promote it, but in the end, the speakers were earnest, and the listeners were dismissive. The lesson of this failure seems worthy of deep thought!</p>
<h3>Torrential Rain Ceases for Three Days and Nights, Most of Chengdu City is Flooded; The Disaster in Western Sichuan is Particularly Severe, All Transportation is Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch on the 14th] The torrential rain in Chengdu ceased for three days and nights, causing another flood, the first since July 4th of last year.

<h3>Xu Baiqi and Two Others; Have Not Yet Been Brought to Trial for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Legal Procedure Issues Unresolved</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Xu Baiqi, Tao Qiming, and Yuan Yang'an were arrested by the Capital Police Department and sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Criminal Tribunal in Nanjing for interrogation due to leaking the confidential information of the currency reform. However, due to legal procedure issues, the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Criminal Tribunal has not yet opened a trial. The focus of the dispute is that the Presidential Office wants to hand over the Xu case to the Special Criminal Tribunal for trial, while the Executive Yuan believes that the case is a breach of official duty by public officials who leaked confidential information and should be investigated by the Capital District Prosecutor's Office. As a result, the interrogation work of the Special Prosecutor's Office has been difficult to begin before the legal procedures are resolved. On the 14th, Chen Guangyu, the chief prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, and Wang Wenjun, the chief prosecutor of the Special Prosecutor's Office, consulted on the investigation work of the Xu case. It has not yet been specifically decided whether the case will be investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office or the Special Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The investigation report and related proposals drafted by Supervising Committee members Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin on the investigation of the leaking confidential information and stock dumping case were submitted to the Supervising Committee on the morning of the 14th.

<h3>US Aid for Four Railways; Does Not Match the Ministry of Communications' Plan</h3>
<p>Will Be Redrafted or Revised</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Most of the funds for the ten new economic recovery plans announced by Mr. Stuart, the head of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration investigation team, are designated for improving China's four major railways. The reporter recently visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of Communications regarding the opinions on the allocation of the amount of this aid and the plan for its use. According to the discussion, after the principle of American aid to improve the railway was determined, we drafted a detailed plan for the needs and uses. The need was to stipulate in principle the goals to be improved and the construction standards for each railway, and the use was to allocate the aid funds within the scope of the maximum possible improvement. These two plans have been drafted several times by the Ministry of Communications in conjunction with the various railway bureaus. However, the amount of funds in the original plan does not match what Mr. Stuart announced, so the Ministry of Communications will draft a new plan or revise and reduce the previously drafted plan.</p>

<p>Today, our nation has a major flaw, which is that many people clearly know we are a poor country, yet insist on putting on a pretentious display. If we only view China from Rue Pétain in Shanghai, then China's cultural level seems very high. And if we only look at the so-called Shanghai people's luxurious clothing and fashionable cars, then the enjoyment of the Chinese people seems to exceed that of any other country. But how many Rue Pétains are there after all? And how many people are wearing luxurious clothes and riding in fashionable cars? I can say that it is a very small number. The vast majority of people still live in thatched huts and attics. There are even tens of millions of people wandering the streets and alleys, groaning in the fields and gullies. They are simply a group of beggars, even considering a pair of straw sandals a rare luxury.</p>
<p>We should frankly admit that our country is a poor country, and our compatriots are suffering compatriots. We must know that foreign cars, refrigerators, perfume, and nylon stockings are all white blood cells parasitic in a poor country. They are opium that destroys the national economy. Using foreign exchange to exchange for high-end luxury goods is a national suicide policy. We are not opposed to the development of foreign trade, but we should know that what we need are machines and the machines that make machines. Because only the industrialization and electrification of the country can turn a poor country into a rich and strong country. The problem in the past was that everyone refused to admit that China was a poor country and did not know that a poor country should have the plans of a poor country. Today, we are indeed a poor country, but should we continue to let it be poor? No, continuing to be poor is the road to destruction.</p>
<p>Why are we so poor? From the Xinhai Revolution to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in these thirty years, our country has encountered constant foreign aggression. Even today, we have not been able to let our people breathe a sigh of relief. The external enemy should be imperialism, but what about the internal situation? Our internal enemies include local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside and speculative merchants in the cities. These two forces collude with each other and take advantage of each other, resulting in the current instability of the country. At the same time, the development of the Communist Party has also taken advantage of this weakness. Therefore, it has further increased the difficulties of the country today. If we want to not be poor, we must eliminate these factors that lead to poverty. This is a great thing and also the most serious and difficult thing in the final stage of the National Revolution.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Since we admit that our country is a poor country, can we ignore it because it is poor? Only unfilial children look down on their poor parents; only unfilial descendants of the Yellow Emperor look down on their poor motherland. Precisely because the country is poor and the compatriots are poor, we should love, protect, and rescue it even more. The reason why heroes and heroines in history are admired by people for generations lies in the fact that their blood flowed for the country and their lives were sacrificed for the country. Loving the country, protecting the country, and saving the country are the great spirit of Chinese tradition. Serving the country with loyalty is the most glorious cause that the Chinese people believe in. However, today, some people are anesthetized by US dollars, gold, pearls, and treasures, and have forgotten the country. Still others are anesthetized by foreign, incorrect, so-called fashionable ideas and have forgotten the nation. They are all anesthetized and can no longer think of the pain of a person without a country, nor can they think of how painful it is to be abandoned by the country. They never dream that if there is no country, their future lives will probably be worse than those of White Russians and Jews.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has always advocated "workers of all countries, unite!", but when the German army approached Moscow, it had to put away the slogan "workers of all countries, unite!" and replace it with the slogan "protect the motherland." The reason why the Soviet Union defeated the enemy and achieved victory was not by calling on "workers of all countries, unite!", but by calling on "protect the motherland." Tito of Yugoslavia was a disciple of Stalin and a loyal member of the Communist Party, but when he thought of the vital interests of his own country, he bravely broke away from the Communist International. From this, we can see that in today's era, world revolution and international lines are dead ends. If we want to survive, we must have a country. That is to say, we Chinese people can only have life under the banner of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth. (Continued on Page 3)</p>

<h3>Three Envoys Revisit the Kremlin Yesterday for Talks with Molotov, Requesting a Guarantee to Lift the Berlin Blockade</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Moscow broadcast reported that the special envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France went to the Kremlin at 6:00 PM Moscow time (3:00 PM Greenwich Mean Time) to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Previously, British envoy Roberts and French Ambassador Chataigneau had visited US Ambassador Smith to review the final minute of advice from their respective governments, before proceeding to the Kremlin by car.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – It is understood that Stalin will not participate in the four-power conference at the Kremlin on the 14th. Furthermore, unless the Soviet Union can change its attitude to make progress in the conference, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have agreed to prepare for a break. Unless the Berlin blockade is lifted immediately, the Western powers will submit the Berlin issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 13th] Reliable sources say: the Western three envoys will try to hold a decisive meeting in Moscow with the Soviet authorities on the Berlin situation. Only the Kremlin can decide whether Stalin will attend the meeting. If Stalin does not intend to participate, the three envoys will likely meet with Molotov. It is believed here that the three envoys will directly ask Stalin to clearly order the Soviet commander in Berlin to guarantee that the blockade will be lifted and that negotiations on details there can continue unimpeded. After the Soviet meeting on the Berlin crisis moved from Moscow to Berlin, the Soviet side suddenly raised various technical issues, shattering all hope of reaching an agreement to lift the Berlin blockade and issue a unified currency for Berlin. British sources here believe that unrest that intensifies the Berlin situation is unlikely to be prevented from recurring unless the Soviet military commander issues a direct order to the German Communist Party to stop it.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall met alone with President Truman at the White House today, presumably discussing the explosive situation after the Soviet Union refused to lift the Berlin blockade, but Marshall and other State Department officials declined to comment on the meeting or the stage to which the Berlin situation had reached.</p>
<h3>Discussion of the Disposal of Italian Colonies, Four Powers Have No Hope of Compromise, Likely to be Submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Paris broadcast reported that the four-power representatives held a second meeting at 11:00 AM this morning. The French representative suggested returning Somaliland to Italy under United Nations trusteeship, to be ruled by Italy. The United Kingdom and the United States have accepted this, but the Soviet Union expressed opposition. Another French suggestion was that issues arising in the four-power meeting be referred to a committee of experts for study. The opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have also aligned on this. Based on the current situation, there is very little hope of reaching an agreement on the Italian colonial issue. Even on the question of whether the four-power representatives have the authority to decide on the future disposal of Libya, Eritrea, and Somaliland, opinions cannot converge. If an agreement cannot be reached by the 15th, then in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, this issue must be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[Washington News Agency Paris, 14th] The report of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference on Italian colonies is now on the agenda and will be studied by the four-power representatives present.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 14th] It is understood that the United Kingdom and the United States will seek to have the United Nations pass a resolution maintaining the status quo of Italian-held Libya, because the United States has an air base in western Libya. On the morning of the 14th, the Western countries hoped to maintain the current military administration, but the Soviet Union suggested that all colonies be returned to Italy. This point is undoubtedly opposed by the Western countries. The strategic value of this issue far outweighs its economic and political value. The Soviet Union will make every effort to seize the opportunity to enable the Italian Communist Party to obtain material for anti-British and anti-American propaganda.</p>
<h3>The French Queuille Cabinet Wins the Confidence of Parliament</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Paris broadcast reported that the French National Assembly passed a vote of confidence in Queuille's new cabinet on the 14th by a vote of 335 to 225.</p>
<h3>US Representatives to the United Nations General Assembly Depart for Paris by Ship, Secretary Marshall to Fly to Europe on the 19th</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service New York, 13th] Most of the 71 members of the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly departed for Paris today aboard the "America" mail ship. The delegation is led by Austin and Mrs. Roosevelt. Dewey's foreign policy advisor Dulles is currently in Europe. Marshall is scheduled to fly to Paris on the 19th.</p>
<h3>The US Attitude Towards the Japanese Peace Conference is Cold</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] Diplomatic circles say that if rumors are true that China will raise its desire to conclude a peace treaty with Japan at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, this is only China's attempt to gauge the views of the four powers on the possibility of concluding a peace treaty with Japan, not to put the matter on the agenda.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 13th] According to reliable sources, senior US officials remain cool to the issue of a Japanese peace treaty. They believe that as long as East-West tensions remain unresolved this year, even convening a preliminary five-power meeting on this issue is unlikely. Although they have gradually realized the importance of the strategic situation in the Far East for Soviet expansion in Europe, senior US officials believe that raising the issue of a Japanese peace conference at this time is still inappropriate. Diplomatic sources say that it is doubtful whether this issue can be discussed at the United Nations General Assembly, as it is not on the agenda.</p>
<h3>US to Resume Acceptance of Air Parcels to China from Saturday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 13th, United Press] The Post Office Department announced that it will begin handling air mail to Belgium, Luxembourg, and seven locations across the Pacific from the 18th. The aforementioned locations across the Pacific include Australia, China, Fiji, Hong Kong, Macau, the Philippines, and Siam.</p>
<h3>Indian Army Marches Directly on Hyderabad City, Fierce Resistance from Hyderabad on All Lines in the Southwest and Northwest, Muslim Public Demands Declaration of War on India</h3>
<p>[United Press New Delhi, 14th] According to news from Karachi on the 14th: Muslim public have held marches demanding that Pakistan declare war on India, because the Indian army has invaded Hyderabad. According to the latest news from Pune, near the front lines, journalists have been permitted to enter the war zone. It is said that the Indian army is attacking Hyderabad city from all sides. General speculation is that the Indian government's declaration of a state of emergency may be a prelude to war with Pakistan. The declaration of a state of emergency is clearly intended to prevent religious riots by the minority Muslim population in India, or to prepare to repel Pakistani attacks on the border.</p>
<p>According to news from Bombay, where a concentrated minority of Muslims live: police and troops have stepped up patrols to prevent any possible disturbances. An army spokesman said that the Indian army is constantly advancing, but he acknowledged that it has encountered strong resistance from the Hyderabad army on the western, northwestern, and southwestern fronts.</p>
<p>[United Press Bombay, 14th] According to news from Pune city: Indian aircraft bombed Bidar city, fifteen miles northwest of Hyderabad city, on the 14th to assist the advance of army troops. According to the Pune dispatch of the "Free Press Journal" of Pune: the Muslim stronghold of Usberda city has been captured by the Indian army.</p>
<p>[United Press New Delhi, 13th] Indian troops attacked Hyderabad on the 13th under the cover of aircraft and artillery, and captured Nalgonda, a city at the intersection of railways and highways, located 200 miles northwest of Hyderabad city. Indian officials said that the Indian Air Force had been dropping leaflets over Hyderabad all day, stating: once normal living conditions in the state are effectively restored, the Indian army will no longer be stationed in Hyderabad. Thereafter, the people of Hyderabad will have the opportunity to decide their future.</p>
<h3>Security Council to Convene Special Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Indian Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Paris broadcast reported that Jebb, the President of the United Nations Security Council, is scheduled to convene a special meeting on the 16th to discuss the Hyderabad crisis in India.</p>
<h3>New Burmese Cabinet Formed</h3>
<p>Government Troops Abandon Yangdong West of Rangoon</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Rangoon broadcast reported that Prime Minister Thakin Nu announced on the 14th that the new Burmese cabinet will be organized by five members of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, five members of the Socialist Party, three members of the Yellow Band Party, and four members of the Independent Party. Political figures believe that the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Defense will both remain in their posts, and Ko Ko Gyi will serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The Parliament has already accepted this new cabinet lineup.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Rangoon, 13th] According to a government gazette, government troops have now abandoned Yangdong, west of Rangoon. The fall of Yangdong has temporarily halted military shipping between Rangoon and Bassein.</p>
<h3>British Conscription Extended by Three Months</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – The British government announced on the 14th that the military service of all conscripts in the British army will be extended by three months.</p>
<h3>US Announces Results of Investigation into Soviet Teachers Case</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 13th] The US State Department has informed the Soviet government that the Department considers the long-publicized case of Soviet teachers refusing to return to their home country to be closed.</p>
<h3>British Parliament Special Session Opens, King George Attends and Delivers Brief Speech, Bill to Reduce Powers of the House of Lords to be Reconsidered</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 14th] The King attended the special session of Parliament today and delivered a brief speech, which read in full: "Lords and Members of the House of Commons: I have summoned you to meet at this time so that you may give further consideration to the bill to amend the Parliament Act of 1911, because disagreements arose between the two Houses in the previous session. No other business is scheduled for this session." Forty-one gun salutes were fired in respect when the King and Queen arrived at the entrance to the House of Lords.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 13th] The Labour government launched a campaign to weaken some of the powers of the House of Lords. The dispute between the Houses of Parliament arose from this bill. The House of Lords has already rejected the bill, and Labour now hopes to win its fight with the Lords through clever parliamentary tactics. These tactics will allow the steel nationalization bill to become law before the 1950 general election. The Conservative Party's minority of seats in the House of Commons makes it unable to oppose Labour's bill, so it can only fight in the House of Lords.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 13th] The Cabinet decided that due to Prime Minister Attlee's incomplete recovery, Deputy Prime Minister Morrison will speak on behalf of the government in the parliamentary debate. The Cabinet also decided that Foreign Secretary Bevin's report on the Berlin situation and the Moscow talks should be postponed for several days.</p>
<h3>Korea to Request United Nations General Assembly Member States to Recognize the South Korean Government De Jure, Head of South Korean Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly Speaks in the US</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 14th] Chang Myon, head of the South Korean delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly, said here today that Korea will ask the United Nations General Assembly to recognize the South Korean government led by Syngman Rhee and introduce all member states, requesting them to grant it de jure recognition. The South Korean delegation also includes Chang Ki-yong, Kim Hwal-ran, and Chun Kyu-hong. The delegation arrived here on the 11th and will depart for Paris aboard the Queen Mary tomorrow morning. In a one-hour press conference, in addition to expressing the above two goals, Chang also said: (1) Communist-controlled North Korea may also send representatives to attend, but because the Soviet Union has refused to allow the United Nations delegation to visit North Korea, the elections in North Korea have not been monitored by the delegation, so even if North Korea sends a delegation to Paris, it will not be able to attend the United Nations General Assembly; (2) At the request of Korea, the United States is currently training the Korean army. South Korea will soon have well-equipped troops for self-defense; (3) Korea is also requesting economic assistance from the United States.</p>
<h3>Where is Shanghai Going?</h3>
<p>— Chiang Ching-kuo</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 2) While we acknowledge that China is poor and that China must survive independently, we should also acknowledge that China is a powerful country. China has such vast land, rich surface and underground resources, and 450 million hardworking and simple compatriots. This is truly an inexhaustible, inexhaustible natural great force. However, what we regret is that we do not have the opportunity to develop it, to mobilize it, and to make it play its role. If we want to turn our country from poor to rich and strong, we must use this force. We can say that when this force is brought into play, it will surely be the greatest force in the world. Not only that, but China also has a kind of hidden, latent spiritual force, which is the righteousness of our Chinese nation and the noble morality of the people. The Chinese nation has never yielded at every important juncture. In fact, this is the source of all strength. When Japanese imperialism attacked us, we knew that we did not have enough strength to resist the powerful warlords, but when sacrifice reached the final moment, we resolutely rose up to fight against Japan regardless of everything. Finally, we finally won the victory.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party used pressure and inducement to the government, attempting to organize a coalition government. At that time, there were even many people in the country who came out to criticize the government's decision to suppress the rebellion, but at the critical moment of life and death, the government never yielded to it. Many people thought that organizing a coalition government would stop the war, but everyone must understand that if a coalition government were established, our country would probably have become Czechoslovakia, Poland, or Romania long ago. Fortunately, we still have the traditional spirit of not surrendering and not yielding, so although we are poor and suffer today, we still maintain an independent personality. President Chiang, who leads our revolution, is the representative of this Chinese national righteousness. His greatness lies in the fact that he is in the most difficult, most distressed, most dangerous, and most complex environment, but he must be able to save the country and the people from the storm and rain without fear of hardship and difficulty. We believe that under the leadership of the leader, our country will be able to maintain an independent and autonomous position. If we take this opportunity, all our people will be of one heart and mind, work together, and continue to struggle, then our country will surely be transformed from poor to rich and strong. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Today, the country's environment is quite difficult. This difficult environment is indeed a crisis for the country. But we can say that this crisis can also be turned into an opportunity. Now we have reached the point where we must make a firm decision to thoroughly reform the country's politics and economy. The country needs to exist, and the people need to live. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of suppressing the rebellion, the people's lives are already unbearable. But to improve the people's lives, we must stabilize society, we must stabilize the economy, and to stabilize the economy, we must reform the currency system. This reason is very obvious. So I can say here that the new economic policy promulgated by the government now is not just a simple decree, but should be regarded as a social revolution and the beginning of the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Today's suppression of commodity prices is only a technical task, and the real purpose is to eliminate the phenomenon of economic inequality in society, or more precisely, to not allow the phenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer to grow in society.</p>
<p>Many people doubt whether this new economic policy will be successful. This is not surprising, because many policies in the past have failed. But if this policy is regarded as a social revolutionary movement and this policy is implemented with revolutionary means, then I believe this policy will definitely be successful. Otherwise, if this matter is regarded as an ordinary government order, dealt with temporarily, and perfunctorily, then we might as well not do it. Even if we do it, it will fail. Therefore, we recognize that the nature of this new economic policy is a revolutionary movement. Therefore, from the beginning, we have advocated mobilizing the broad masses of people to participate in this great work and should tell the people that this is our own business and we should rise up to complete it ourselves. The people's affairs can only be solved by the people's own hands. Relying on others is unreliable. To turn the old society over, we must use the greatest strength and the greatest price to succeed. Today has come the time for thorough reform. As far as Shanghai is concerned, the society here is indeed corrupt. However, we should not ignore that although Shanghai is corrupt, the power of resistance still exists. Therefore, all our people must carry out this arduous work in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner. Many people think that today's situation must change. Yes, it should change, and it is already changing. But the strangest thing is that those who used to advocate change suddenly no longer advocate change, or they say that it should change gradually. These people do not understand that social changes will inevitably encounter unexpected storms and difficulties. They are afraid when they see danger and obstacles. That will not succeed. Now that it has begun to change, it must change to the end and it must change to a reason. (Continued on Page 4)</p>

<h3>Special Tribunal Holds Hearing for Four Defendants in Black Market Gold and Foreign Currency Case; China Cement Company Manager and Assistant Manager Called to Testify; Discrepancies in the Testimony of Wei Boxiang and Meiji; Aiqier Admits to Selling US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wei Boxiang, a legal foreign exchange broker of the Central Bank, his wife Yao Zaiying, Meiji, a Russian of Jewish nationality, and Xi Ren Aiqier, the general manager of Annan Bank, were previously investigated and prosecuted by the Special Criminal Tribunal on suspicion of engaging in black market gold and foreign currency transactions. Yesterday, the tribunal brought forth the four defendants, including Wei Boxiang, who were in custody, and summoned Shi Naixiu, the manager of China Cement Company, and Yao Qingde, the assistant manager, to testify. Judge Jiang Shanchu conducted a public trial.</p>
<p>At around 3 p.m., after the judge took the bench, he immediately ordered the four defendants in custody to stand to one side. Wei's face was fair and pale. He was wearing a checkered, light flannel suit jacket, gray gabardine trousers, and yellow leather shoes. Wei's wife looked thin and pale, her hair tied with pink silk. She wore a blue cheongsam, a light gray woolen coat, and was barefoot, wearing black satin embroidered shoes. Aiqier was tall and robust, with graying hair, a ruddy complexion, and wore glasses. He was wearing a blue suit jacket and gray trousers. Meiji was relatively thin and small, and wore glasses and a flannel suit. Wei's wife whispered to Wei, and she dabbed at her tears with a white handkerchief from time to time.</p>
<p>First, Yao Qingde was called to testify. The focus of the questioning was to investigate where the 30,000 US dollars used by Wei Boxiang for the transaction came from. According to Yao, he is a Shanghai native, residing at 121 Yanging Road, and is a businessman. Wei's ex-wife is his elder sister; he serves as the assistant manager of China Cement Company; because China Cement Company applied to the Import and Export Control Committee for the import of raw materials, the committee approved 40,000 US dollars per month, totaling 200,000 US dollars, which were settled in foreign exchange over the four months of April, May, June, and July. In early August, 6,000 US dollars were handed over to the Bank of China. The remaining 34,000 US dollars were handed over to Wei Boxiang on August 26 to be passed on to the Central Bank to purchase foreign exchange certificates, with a handling fee of 574,000 legal tender. He does not know what happened after the money was handed over to Wei Boxiang.</p>
<p>Witness Shi Naixiu stated: 52 years old, from Jiashan, Zhejiang, residing at Lane 6, No. 877 Zhongzheng Middle Road, serving as the manager of China Cement Company. His responsibilities within the company are to promote business. Economic deployment is the responsibility of Yao. He only knows that the 34,000 US dollars were borrowed from the company's general manager and handed over by Yao to Wei Boxiang to purchase foreign exchange certificates. Because this matter was handled by Yao, the details are not clear.</p>
<h3>Testimony of the Four Defendants</h3>
<p>Wei Boxiang testified: After Yao handed me the 34,000 US dollars on August 26, the banks were closed on the 27th for Confucius' birthday, and the money could not be sent in time. It happened that Meiji borrowed money from me, so I temporarily lent it to him. As a designated foreign exchange broker of the Central Bank, the daily inflow and outflow of US dollars is around 100,000 yuan, so I did not initially take this temporary loan of over 30,000 US dollars seriously. I did not expect the situation to become so serious.</p>
<p>Yao Zaiying testified: She went to Meiji's house with Wei, but did not carry or transport US dollars.</p>
<p>Meiji denied borrowing 30,000 US dollars from Wei, but stated that because Wei needed money, he lent Wei a check for 120,999 gold yuan from Datong Bank, which was equivalent to about 30,000 US dollars. Wei mortgaged 30,000 US dollars. It was not a buying or selling transaction. Meiji admitted to purchasing 3,000 US dollars from Aiqier on August 18, with each dollar priced at 10.7 million legal tender (i.e., the black market price at the time).</p>
<p>Aiqier also admitted to selling 3,000 US dollars to Meiji, but the US dollars were not his own property. They were deposited there by a friend from Xiguo, who has already returned to France.</p>
<p>The hearing concluded at around 5 p.m. Yao Zaiying requested bail in court, but it was not allowed. She was instructed to submit a written application for consideration. The four defendants were all returned to custody.</p>
<p>When they stepped out of the trial room, photographers rushed to capture the scene. Zhang Boxiang put on sunglasses, Meiji lowered his head and walked quickly, and Aiqier covered his face with a white silk scarf. All three had their hands handcuffed and were escorted by bailiffs to the detention center of the Special Tribunal.</p>

<p>Temporary Proposal Section: It is suggested that the authorities immediately stop the soaring gasoline prices, restore the original price of August 19, and order the Public Utilities Bureau to implement a thorough investigation of private automobile users and revoke the right to use cars that are not necessary within a time limit, in order to comply with the thrift decrees. During the discussion of this proposal, Speaker Pan first explained that since the proposal in the Public Utilities Section "to allow the transfer of automobile ownership by the Municipal Government" has been passed, it seems to contradict the point of reducing automobiles in this proposal and should be noted. Regarding the point of stopping gasoline price hikes, the opposing and supporting parties had conflicting opinions. Later, because the number of councilors did not reach the legal quorum, it was not put to a vote. The Speaker announced that it would be changed to be discussed and decided today.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Bureau Celebrates Third Anniversary of Restoration and Receives All Sectors</h3>

<h3>Clerk of the Cashier Department of China Textile Company Sentenced for Misappropriating Public Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Zheng, a clerk in the Cashier Department of China Textile Company, failed in his private business in March of this year. Colluding with Fei Yuwen, a clerk in the same department, he set up a Hu Qifan account in the Bank of Communications. Because Fei Yuwen was in charge of the company's cash, the two secretly deposited public funds into the Hu Qifan account and used bleach to remove the words "Hu Qifan" from the deposit slip and changed it to the China Textile account name to cover it up. Huang then used the money to buy and sell government bonds, once for more than 4 billion yuan and once for 3 billion yuan. After China Textile Company discovered this, the money was returned, and Fei Yuwen took the opportunity to flee. Huang Zheng was detained by the company and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The case was heard in the District Court a few days ago. Chen Shouchi, the head of the Cashier Department of China Textile Company, testified that Fei Yuwen, who is on the run, deliberately misappropriated public funds and altered the date and amount of the deposit slip, with as many as 14 discrepancies, totaling more than 45 billion yuan. The defendant Huang Zheng admitted to embezzling more than 7 billion yuan from Fei twice. The case was recently sentenced by the District Court: Huang Zheng was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for helping others and indirectly profiting from his management affairs, and was deprived of civil rights for five years. Fei Yuwen, who is on the run, will be prosecuted separately after he is caught.</p>

<h3>The Real Estate Industry is Gradually Becoming Active; Speculators are Stirring Up Trouble, and Prices Have Risen by an Average of 20%</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the currency reform of August 19, the fluctuation range of prices has narrowed, and the markets of various industries have tended to be calm. The real estate industry, which has been dormant for a long time, has a good chance of recovering. According to real estate insiders yesterday: After the currency reform of August 19, many of the surplus funds from the National Bank's exchange of gold and foreign currency are concentrated in real estate. Although transactions are active, the actual number of transactions is not large. This can be checked in the handling of real estate transfer cases by the Land Administration Bureau. The number of transfer cases after August 19 has not increased compared to before. He said: After August 19, real estate asking prices in the city have increased by about 50% compared to before. Most of these asking prices are stirred up by brokers, and few transactions are made. The actual transaction price is about 20% higher than before August 19. It is explained that although real estate prices cannot be artificially limited, natural price limits still exist. Those who truly want to purchase real estate can solve the problems of investment and housing shortages and win the good name of supporting the authorities' housing construction policy, so why not do it? However, if the land price is too high, the society cannot consume it after the houses are built, which is in vain. It is estimated that about 10,000 buildings have been completed in the city in the past year, but the depreciation rate of houses is also quite serious, estimated to be 5,000 buildings per year. He hopes that after everything is stable in the future, there should be a reasonable measure for real estate, and the once-popular problem of premium fees can be eliminated. Currently, because (1) the government intends to encourage funds to flow to the real estate industry, (2) land prices are not related to people's livelihood, and the government only needs to control rents, the future of the real estate industry in the city is trending towards becoming more active.</p>
<h3>Appropriation of Donated Land in Ai Li Garden for Construction of a News Museum Unanimously Approved: Temporary Motions by Feng Youzhen, Yue Junyi, etc.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Senators Feng Youzhen, Zhao Junhao, Zhan Wenhu, Tang Shichang, Zhang Zhihan, and over eighty others, yesterday proposed a temporary motion: requesting the allocation of five mu of land from the Hardoon George donation for the construction of a news museum. The reasoning stated: Shanghai is the national center for the news industry, holding a leading position. The number of practitioners is in the thousands. Before the war, there was a guild hall, though rudimentary in scale. During the eight years of resistance against Japan, there was relocation and movement, and the hall was destroyed. Since the post-war restoration, the guild has been re-established for three years, but due to various difficulties, it still lacks a permanent meeting place. Recently, Hardoon George donated land in Ai Li Garden, which this council has resolved to accept, with plans to construct libraries, art museums, and other facilities on the land. The news industry is highly valued by the world, and Shanghai is particularly tied to international perception. So many journalists are employed here, but there is no place for further study or research. Domestic and foreign journalists, whether passing through Shanghai or visiting, lack a place to stay. Furthermore, people from all walks of life lack a suitable venue to interact with the press, make announcements, seek explanations, or inquire about certain issues. This is a source of suffering for journalists themselves and a deficiency for the entire city of Shanghai. We hereby suggest to the general assembly that five mu of land be allocated from the Hardoon George donation to construct a news museum, incorporating the Journalists' Association and the Newspaper Publishers' Association. In addition, a reporters' guest house and an auditorium should be built to meet the needs of national press conferences. In the future, international news conferences may be convened in Shanghai, which is not impossible. All construction costs will be jointly raised by the Newspaper Publishers' Association and the Journalists' Association, without the need to spend public funds or increase the burden on citizens. Two points are suggested for handling: (1) Allocate five mu of public land from the Hardoon George donation of Ai Li Garden for the construction of a news museum. The city government should plan this concurrently with the library, museum, and art museum. (2) The construction costs will be raised independently by the Journalists' Association and the Newspaper Publishers' Association. Result of the discussion: All senators unanimously approved. This motion was successfully passed. However, the area of land allocated will be determined by the city government in a comprehensive manner, and the exact number of mu is not yet specified.</p>
<h3>Post Office Employees Petition Over Salary Issues</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Employees of the Shanghai Postal Administration have repeatedly negotiated with authorities regarding their future salaries, requesting that they be calculated based on the gold yuan equivalent of the August index, but without result. Yesterday morning, all directors and supervisors of the Postal Workers' Union went to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to appeal. It is reported that Director Wu expressed great sympathy for the employees' demands and will discuss the matter with union leaders again today.</p>
<h3>Two Pawnshop Owners Arrested for Trafficking Opium Powder</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Songshan Police Precinct, the night before last, seized 560 cubic centimeters of opium powder from Yucheng Pawnshop at 604 Shunchang Road. The shop owner, Chen Jingyi, and his wife were arrested and confessed to trafficking. They claimed the drugs were purchased from Chen Xueting, owner of Qingcheng Pawnshop at 1766 Nanjing West Road, who was also apprehended and transferred to the District Court yesterday.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Xinjing Police Precinct recently uncovered a drug trafficking case at Huachang Mat Shop at 556 Zhoujiazui Road, seizing opium powder and apprehending a man named Tong Wenyuan. Subsequently, Liang Fulin was arrested at 4 Kangding Road, Shengsheng Lane, and opium powder and raw opium were found during a search. Finally, drug dealers Liu Guangyuan and his wife were arrested at 45 Caojia Street, Old West Gate. The entire case was transferred to the District Court yesterday.</p>
<h3>Where is Shanghai Going?</h3>
<p>— Chiang Ching-kuo</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 3) In the process of advancing our work, there are many enemies there threatening us, saying that continuing to inspect warehouses and punish unscrupulous merchants will lead to shortages and factory shutdowns. Indeed, if we stand on the position of maintaining superficial prosperity, it will disappoint the people; however, if we stand on the position of revolution, this is nothing to fear. The lack of cigarettes, wool yarn, sweaters, silk, wool fabric, or even pork, is not something to be afraid of. Because among the more than five million people in Shanghai, those who can afford to wear noble fabrics are not many. As long as we hold the daily necessities for the masses—rice, salt, oil, coal, and cloth—that is enough for life. We believe that, in order to overwhelm the power of unscrupulous merchants and stabilize the lives of the people of the city, the citizens of Shanghai will never fear the lack of luxurious clothing and abandon the courage to fight unscrupulous merchants. If speculators are not overthrown, adventurers are not driven away, and the nouveau riche are not eliminated, the people of Shanghai will never have a day of peace. As for the issue of factory shutdowns, the government's policy is guided by the Three Principles of the People, protecting private property and encouraging private enterprise. This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. However, if factory owners use shutdowns as a means of coercion, that is nothing to fear. If you don't run the factory, someone else will. With such determination and courage, the new economic policy will never fail. From now on, as long as we continue production, the people have food to eat, and those who have money do not speculate but engage in productive enterprises, we can put Shanghai's economy on the right track and the people's lives on a regular path. Only in this way can the new economic policy be considered successful. We are not afraid of the threats of saboteurs or the intimidation of speculators. We only have the spirit of sacrifice to carry out the implementation of the new economic policy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are many so-called economic theorists who seem right but are not. They believe that solving economic problems should start from a purely economic perspective, otherwise things will become increasingly chaotic. This point of view does not understand the relationship between economics and politics, does not understand the many social and political factors hidden in economic issues, does not understand the role of social politics in influencing economics, and does not understand that the establishment of an economic structure relies on the power of social politics. Economics and social politics are difficult to separate in many complex problems. We should clearly tell everyone that the solution to economic problems should indeed be considered from an economic perspective, but if this leads to doubts about the new economic policies implemented by the government, or doubts about the severe punishment of unscrupulous merchants, this is tantamount to defending unscrupulous merchants. The result is that unscrupulous merchants can act without restraint, making it impossible for the government to implement its policies.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>The economic control work in Shanghai has been going on for three weeks. During these three weeks, because the government's policies have been supported by the people, prices have been stabilized and the credit of the Gold Yuan Certificate has been established. This should be attributed to the majority of the people in Shanghai. On the second day of issuing the Gold Yuan Certificate, some unscrupulous merchants came out to attempt to destroy the price limits of August 19, in order to shake the government's credit. Everyone should remember that in those days, four or five thousand cotton yarn speculators crowded into the market, trying to use speculative capital to purchase cotton yarn and break through the set prices. We have used the power of the government to quell them. Later, although the formal exchange was closed, many people were still buying and selling outside the venue, trying to disrupt the market. We used strong force to close several large securities firms and arrested the most powerful brokers, and only then did we quell this storm. Since then, there have still been people doing a black market for gold notes, but we have finally extinguished these scum who destroy the credit of the government's Gold Yuan Certificate. The phenomena that are now gathering before us are that bank deposits have increased and interest rates have decreased, and real estate prices have also increased. This proves that Shanghai's economic life has begun to normalize. This phenomenon is beneficial to the people and legitimate merchants, which is also the goal we are pursuing. However, this is most unfavorable to unscrupulous merchants, who hope that the market will be more chaotic, because from the chaotic situation they can obtain large amounts of huge profits.</p>
<p>At present, Shanghai is still relatively stable, but does this mean that there will be no problems in the future? No. What we saw in front of us was not a beautiful scene of calm seas and clear skies, but a dangerous future hidden with violent storms and dark clouds, which we anticipated. We are not afraid. As long as we are resolute and brave, this storm will surely pass. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai will not waver and will be determined to eliminate all evil forces. What I want to point out in advance here is that although the big unscrupulous merchants have been closed up and those sentenced to death have been sentenced to death, their power has not been eliminated. Therefore, we must not be complacent about the work done in the short time in the past, and we must not be arrogant because we have received the praise of the people, so that we forget the more arduous struggles in the future. The work of the last three weeks is only the first step in a long-term struggle in the future. Young friends in Shanghai must not have a hedonistic attitude. Hedonism is only temporary and cannot last. What we need today is not temporary hedonism, but to see far, stand firm, and strike accurately. Only in this way can we have hope. We must work hard but not recklessly, quickly but not blindly, and practically but not chaotically. (Reckless work is irrational, blind work is unplanned, and chaotic work is without steps; on the contrary, we want to be rational, planned, and have steps.) (Continued on Page 5)</p>

<h3>Where is Shanghai Going?</h3>
<p>— Chiang Ching-kuo</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 4) Since sending the big unscrupulous merchants to court and confiscating the hoarding of supplies, some people say that this is undemocratic and say that Chiang Ching-kuo is a robber. Many people think that I can scold you, but you cannot scold me; I can hit you, but you cannot hit me; I can do whatever I want is democracy. This is a big mistake. What is democracy? Democracy is standing on the interests of the majority of the people and using the power of the majority of the people to overwhelm the power of the minority. This is democracy. As for who is a robber, that is a question. For example, take Rong Hongyuan as an example: how much property he has, I am afraid it is difficult for him to calculate himself. I heard that he recently built a large garden and a large foreign house on Hongqiao Road, and some people say that half of Wuxi belongs to the Rong family. For example, take Wei Boxiang as an example: his property is several million US dollars. With them making any move they wish, the lives of thousands of people are threatened to starve to death, and their property foreign houses are built on the skulls of the people. Is this behavior any different from robbers? The government has now decided to confiscate the goods that are hoarded for speculation, because speculators use the goods as a tool to disrupt finance and manipulate the market, and not for the purpose of supplying the market. What we want to confiscate is not all the goods, but only the hoarded goods. The property of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises should not only not be harmed in the slightest, but should be protected. The government has decided to sell all the confiscated goods and use the money to do relief work. Who is the robber? Everyone can tell at a glance. What is strange is that today there are people coming out to defend the robbers. Where has the conscience of this kind of people gone? Have they not seen the poor people suffering from hunger and cold, groaning and haggard? How painful a life are they living? Why do you want to defend the bloodsucking robbers instead of speaking for the poor people with no one to turn to?</p>
<p>The merchants in Shanghai have been influenced by the Shanghai style for more than a hundred years, and many people have long forgotten the morality of commerce. What they see is first money, second money, and third still money, but the current era is not the past era. The current era is the era of democracy, the era of the people. In this era, everyone should be equal before the national law, but in morality, we should sympathize with the majority of the poor people.</p>
<p>We cannot explain in detail our working style here, but there are a few things I must tell everyone: Recently, the phrase "beat the tigers" has become a popular term in Shanghai, but the so-called "beat the tigers" is individual heroism. What we need today is to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and fight the evil forces to the end. In addition, recently someone has shouted the two words "Qingtian" (just and upright official), which is also the traditional wrong concept of our Chinese people, who do not regard themselves as the masters, and do not know that it is the duty of the state officials to relieve their pain. They themselves are the masters, and the officials are servants. I myself am young and have little knowledge, but I only have the spirit of serving the people and do what I should do. I am willing to be a servant of the people of Shanghai. If a person does nothing, then so be it; but if he does something, there must be mistakes. I hope that everyone will supervise me and correct me. Only in this way can we complete this arduous task.</p>
<p>The reason why many merchants in Shanghai can become rich is because they have two weapons made by their own shops: one is to fabricate rumors and deceive, and the other is to collude with corrupt officials. If officials collude with merchants, the government will punish them even more severely. Qi Zaiyu has already been shot, and I heard that in the near future, there will be similar people who will also get the same fate. This is a warning to those who are officials. As for fabricating rumors and deceiving, this is the talent of many merchants in Shanghai. They create something out of nothing, destroy the government, and shake the hearts of the people. I hope that you will not fall for their rumors and be deceived by them, and you should strike them mercilessly. Today in Shanghai, we cannot see the flames of war or hear the sound of gunfire, but we should not forget the soldiers in the front, who are fighting against the communists. What they are fighting for is to protect the unity and independence of the country and the lives and property of the people. The communists and the unscrupulous merchants are the two major enemies of the revolution. We must not let go of either of these two. We must beat them in the same way and together.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a few words to our Youth Army: Our Youth Army was organized under the leadership of our supreme leader, and it has had a glorious history in the past during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it also has brilliant achievements now during the Suppression of Communist Rebellion. Some of us have already been demobilized, and some are still in the troops. Those who remain in the front-line troops must perform combat missions, but those who have been demobilized in the rear should also engage in economic suppression of communist rebellion. You must know that the tasks we bear on the economic battlefield are of the same importance as fighting the communists in the front. The Youth Army should have the greatest courage to engage in this arduous and historically significant great work. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Materials Adjustment Committee Resolves to Jointly Purchase Domestic Cotton; China Bank and National Private Spinning Mills Form Joint Purchase Office</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee of the Executive Yuan's Economic Control Committee held its third meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM in the National Bank Conference Room. Chaired by Liu Gongyun, the meeting resolved: (1) Regarding the purchase of cotton, it was decided that the Central Bank would jointly adopt a joint purchase method with national private spinning mills in key locations. A joint purchase office would be jointly organized by state-run and nationally operated textile institutions together with the Central Bank to engage in the purchase. (2) Regarding the method of applying for permits for goods prohibited from being exported, each trade association would be responsible for reviewing and issuing permit certificates, and each association would report the quantity of goods permitted for export and the number of certificates issued to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office on a weekly basis for verification. Other important materials will follow the cotton purchase method, and various groups will be established under the Adjustment Committee, jointly organized by private and state-run institutions, to be responsible for adjusting raw materials and finished products.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hankou Areas to Be Established First</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] After the implementation of the August 19 price limit for cotton yarn, the authorities and various spinning mills felt that the price of raw materials should be reasonably controlled to maintain the new prices of finished products and raw materials, so that the cotton yarn price limit could be maintained. For this purpose, the authorities have now decided to establish a National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee, composed of one representative each from the Central Bank and national private spinning mills. The committee decided to establish a cotton joint purchase office in Shanghai to carry out the business of jointly purchasing raw cotton. It was also decided to establish a branch office in Hankou, and other locations would be set up as needed.</p>
<p>All Shanghai Mills Should Join</p>
<p>All spinning mills in the Shanghai area should join the National Cotton Joint Purchase Office. When cotton from various places is transported to Shanghai, it will be purchased uniformly by the joint purchase office, and each spinning mill may no longer purchase it separately. It is up to the spinning mills outside Shanghai to join the joint purchase office, but foreign spinning mills may entrust the joint purchase office to purchase on their behalf, so as to maintain the uniform price of national cotton. In addition to Shanghai, spinning mills in other places may still freely purchase national cotton from various places, but they must abide by the national cotton price limits in various places.</p>
<p>Purchase of Cotton to Be Distributed Periodically</p>
<p>The funds for purchasing cotton by the joint purchase office will be paid by each spinning mill in the amount of one month's worth of cotton as a down payment, and the Central Bank will also pay an equal amount of funds, with each obtaining half the amount for the purchase of national cotton. However, in principle, the Central Bank still hopes that each mill can pay more funds for purchasing cotton. The cotton that has been purchased will be distributed once every half month or one month. Matters such as the evaluation of cotton purchased by the joint purchase office will be handled centrally. As for procedures such as viewing samples, public weighing, and inspection, to be impartial, they will be entrusted to a third party to handle. It is heard that the cotton pricing will be based on: (1) the ratio of cotton prices to grain prices in the production area, so as not to harm cotton farmers; (2) the ratio of cotton prices to yarn prices, so that the prices of finished products and raw materials will not be decoupled.</p>
<h3>First Batch of U.S. Aid Cotton Distributed to Various Spinning Mills Starting Today</h3>
<p>Valued at US$13 Million</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The arrangements for the distribution of the first batch of US$70 million in U.S. aid cotton in China have been prepared, and it can begin to be implemented today. The above news was jointly announced by the Director of the Cooperation Administration, Lai Puhan, and the Secretary-General of the U.S. Aid Joint Use Committee, Shen Xirui, after a meeting held yesterday afternoon between the U.S. Aid Committee's cotton group and representatives of the Cooperation Administration. Therefore, 69,878 bales of cotton can be distributed to various spinning mills in China. This cotton is the first allocation from the Cooperation Administration from April to June, valued at US$13 million. Since a basic agreement has been reached on the principles of distribution, another batch of cotton worth US$41.7 million can be distributed to Chinese spinning mills. Of the US$70 million plan, there is still US$15.3 million remaining, which will be divided into third and fourth installments, which will include October of this year to March of next year. At current prices, this amount is sufficient to purchase 100,000 bales of cotton. Therefore, the total amount of U.S. aid cotton will exceed 400,000 bales, or 200 million pounds.</p>
<h3>Bulk Shipment of Gauze and Cooking Oil to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank's Materials and Finance Committee held its eighth meeting at 5:00 PM on the 13th, chaired by Li Lixia. It was resolved that, in order to stabilize prices in Guangzhou and strengthen the supply, the Textile Construction Company and the Central Trust Bureau should be requested to allocate and ship a large quantity of gauze and cooking oil there. As for the export of frozen eggs in the autumn of this year, the request of the Frozen Egg Industry Association has been approved, and the industry will raise funds on its own to manufacture them for export.</p>
<p>Another report: According to the General Manager of the China Textile Company, Shu Yunzhang, after the restriction on the export of South China gauze from this city, the source has gradually become scarce. A telegram has been sent to the company urging it to quickly ship 2,000 bales of cotton yarn and 200,000 bolts of cloth to supply the market. Currently, the export of gauze and cloth from both state-owned and private enterprises must be approved by the authorities. This batch of gauze and cloth will begin to be shipped south as soon as it is approved by the Supervisory Office.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company, which was originally a special company, has now been ordered to be sold. A board meeting will be convened this week to decide on the matter of reorganizing it into a limited company. If one-tenth of the shares are sold, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to re-elect directors and supervisors in accordance with the company's regulations. Regardless of whether they are government shares or commercial shares, all will enjoy rights and bear obligations in accordance with the Company Law. The Central Bank is planning to handle the sale of shares in other cities.</p>
<h3>Hakka Merchants' Actual Sales Lackluster, Cotton Yarn Prices Decline, Cloth Sales Improve, Market Slightly Lively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw tightening credit among the industry. Furthermore, with the actual demand from major Hakka merchants being lackluster, yarn dealers experienced weak sales. Most businesses were selling more than they were buying, resulting in a sluggish market atmosphere.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were mostly for 10-count and 20-count coarse yarns, with prices declining gradually within the limits. Various fine yarns were abundantly supplied, and the weaving industry absorbed them well, keeping the market stable. 21-count Double Horse yarn fell to 750 yuan, a significant drop of 27 yuan compared to the previous day. Yarns below 20-count also fell by varying amounts, from 5-6 yuan to 10 yuan. Coarse yarns traded around 20 yuan within the price limit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, after consecutive days of decline, mostly retreated into the price limits. Hakka merchants, due to the export ban, still made few large purchases. Local stores and shops supplied for actual sales in the cool autumn, frequently absorbing stock. The market saw a surge in buying interest, and prices rose slightly.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened lower by 3 jiao (0.3 yuan). Subsequently, news spread that the Cloth Industry Association had requested permission from the Materials Adjustment Committee for export, and that approval for shipment was likely. It was also learned that the authorities stipulated that each person could carry two bolts when leaving the country. Shops in other cities needed goods, and "single-handedly" peddlers actively sought them out, causing Dragon Head prices to rebound to 26.8 yuan at closing, a 3 jiao improvement compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji (a type of fabric) saw surprisingly strong demand from local stores, with prices rising by more than one yuan. In addition, low-end secondary brand B-character fine cloth and Yuan Zhi Gong (another type of fabric) also saw prices become brisk. Total transaction volume for the day was around 1,600 bolts.</p>
<p>Another report: The Textile Construction Company opened sales of Five Fortunes fine cloth at a price of 23.9 yuan per bolt, and Taoyuangang Yuan fine cloth, Four Gentlemen Yellow Card, and other grades of Zhi Gong呢 (a type of wool fabric),坯布(unfinished cloth), sheets and other items, totaling 13 kinds. Most applicants were local cloth stores, and there were more requests for Five Fortunes and large-size fine cloth.</p>
<h3>If There Are Doubts About Gold Exchange, Applications Can Be Made for Joint Re-verification</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, there have been complaints from various places regarding the Central Bank's gold exchange, such as excessively high requirements for fineness, congestion and time consumption. Our reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Central Bank, who stated that the congestion situation has improved since the authorization of four banks to handle the exchange. As for the gold fineness, it is in accordance with government regulations, and the bank cannot arbitrarily change it. In order to improve the efficiency of the exchange, a telegram has been sent to all branches stating that the fineness or quantity should not be deliberately reduced. After the appraisal, if the person making the exchange has doubts, they should be allowed to apply for joint re-verification. Gold ingots manufactured by the Central Mint, unless there are special reasons (such as tampering or counterfeiting), should be verified and exchanged according to the original fineness listed by the factory. All efforts should be made to facilitate the exchange for those holding gold.</p>
<h3>Credit Conditions Remain Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the credit conditions in local silver shops remained loose. The National Bank Treasury had a deficit of 650,000 yuan in the exchange of notes among silver and money businesses.

<h3>Poor Sales, Sluggish Transactions: Rice Prices Stagnant, Flour Prices Fall, Cooking Oil Market Plunges</h3>
<p>The rice market remained weak and sluggish. Although the supply of new goods was scarce, the sales remained poor, resulting in sluggish transactions and stagnant prices. In the southern market, upper and middle-grade goods managed to hold their ground, but overnight white glutinous rice fell by 0.5 yuan, and upland rice fell slightly by 0.1 yuan. The supply of new rice from Pudong increased, but sales were slow, and the price was 0.2 yuan lower. White Yuan rice remained at the original price of 20.066 yuan. In the northern market, the prices of various types of rice were almost unchanged from the previous day, showing signs of stability. Yesterday, 970 shi of rice arrived in the southern market, and 1,170 shi in the northern market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Continued to see a slight decline. Actual sales were scarce, and sales in the inland areas stagnated, resulting in poor sales. Old Car flour was 7.5 yuan, a drop of 0.05 yuan. Warship flour fell by 0.03 yuan, Jiancheng flour fell by 0.03 yuan, and miscellaneous brands of flour fell by varying amounts, from 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Wheat bran continued to fall by 0.03 yuan. Wheat remained at the original price of 10.03 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Continued on a weak path. Demand was sluggish, and actual sales remained weak. In the local market, new soybeans sold better and prices remained stable. Vehicle beans and Zha beans fell by 0.3-0.5 yuan due to poor factory demand. Vehicle beans closed at 11.3 yuan. Corn saw weak demand from northern merchants and fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan. There were still only a few transactions in Yuan wheat. Very little Tea beans opened. Red sorghum rose by 0.3 yuan due to purchases from Shantou and Xiamen merchants. Sesame fell by 0.5 yuan. Raw kernels are not opening.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The price drop was rampant, especially for raw oil, which saw the largest decline. Jilong raw oil plunged to 60 yuan, a sharp drop of 3 yuan. Bean oil factories reduced production, and spot prices fell by 1 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell by 0.5-1 yuan, because since the suspension of exports, supply has suddenly exceeded demand. Large raw oil dealers were selling off their stock, causing the most dramatic decline. Small cart sesame oil also sharply fell by 2 yuan. The bean cake market turned slightly firmer, as merchants made some purchases.</p>
<h3>Nearly 3 Million Yuan of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks Sold</h3>
<p>On the 14th, agent banks sold a total of 400,440 yuan in Jin Yuan of state-owned enterprise stocks from five units, including Textile Construction and China Merchants. Among them, Textile Construction accounted for 284,500 yuan, Taiwan Sugar 100,900 yuan, and Taiwan Paper 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Tianjin's Exports Increased Sharply Last Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin, 14th] Tianjin's export value increased sharply in August. According to statistics from the Tianjin Commercial Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the total value of export goods inspected and approved in August was 3,970,268.04 yuan in Jin Yuan. Pig bristles still accounted for the vast majority, totaling 3,115,602.27 yuan. In comparison, Tianjin's total export value in July was over 47,669 billion yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Detailed Procedures for Applying for Export Permits to be Announced Today</h3>
<p>According to information from the Economic Supervision Office, the office attaches great importance to the export ban. It had previously formulated procedures for applying for permits, which are now finalized. For the sake of caution and to achieve coordination in the work, the procedures have been submitted to the secretariats of the Inspection and Materials Adjustment Committees for joint study to ensure they are comprehensive. It is expected that the procedures may be officially approved and implemented today (the 15th).</p>
<p>It is believed that after implementation, closer cooperation can be achieved between various departments, which will facilitate promotion. The portion of goods detained for inspection at the North Station in recent days can also be processed quickly. If it is deemed that there is no conflict with the procedures, they can be returned to the original owners.</p>
<h3>Western Tea Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Western tea market was still actively sought after by export merchants. The process was quite lively, but unfortunately, due to scarce supply, transactions remained small, and prices remained quite stable.</p>
<p>It is learned that, in order to actively expand the direct export of Chinese tea, local Chinese export firms have not only sent letters to Europe, but have also compiled samples and sent them abroad for promotion. It is also reported that China Airlines will have a special flight to Africa on the 16th of this month, and tea merchants are preparing to send a large number of samples of Chun Mee green tea, Zhen Mei green tea, and other goods to that region. As for domestic tea, the balance between supply and demand has remained relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Production Area Prices Rise, Overseas Tung Oil Market Weakens</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Export Management Committee announced yesterday: This week (September 6-11), Shanghai's controls were strict, and the situation was roughly the same as last week. However, the inventory of various goods gradually became low, and transactions inevitably became sluggish. Overseas market conditions were generally stable. The overseas market for tung oil, one of the main export products, continued to show improvement. On Tuesday, the New York market rose to US$0.2025 per pound. Unfortunately, domestic tung oil production area prices rose, resulting in a scarce supply of goods and sluggish transactions. Also, according to a London telegram on the weekend, the local oil market weakened, and importers' buying prices were slightly lower, with barrelled oil at £152 per long ton and bulk oil at only £144.</p>

<h3>Li Ximou Writes to Public and Private School Teachers and Staff: Expand the Number of Free Places for Needy Students; Don't Focus on Tuition Fees and Salaries, and Disregard Students Dropping Out of School</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Ximou, acting director of the city's Education Bureau, in order to implement the City Council's resolution on the issue of students applying for tuition reductions and waivers, yesterday issued an open letter to all principals, teachers, and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city. The letter stated:</p>
<p>Recently, there has been much criticism in public opinion about a small number of schools overcharging tuition and miscellaneous fees; students applying for tuition reductions and waivers are often rejected or reprimanded by teachers, which has aroused the indignation of many parents. The regulations regarding the number of tuition reductions and waivers are decided by the City Council, and the Municipal Government and the Education Bureau are only implementing agencies for these resolutions.</p>
<p>Distorted Concepts Must Be Corrected</p>
<p>When approving the fee standards for each semester, the estimated income of the school is taken into account, and the number of students with tuition reductions and waivers has already been deducted. Therefore, schools setting the number of tuition reductions and waivers according to regulations will not affect the salaries of teachers and staff. Teachers in private schools in this city often believe that increasing the number of free students reduces revenue, and some principals even use this to deceive teachers. This distorted concept must be corrected so that teachers do not harbor resentment towards free students. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Unlimited Expansion of Free Places</p>
<p>Private schools advocate that tuition standards should not be restricted. In principle, the Education Bureau originally expressed sympathy, but the prerequisite is that poor students will not drop out of school due to high tuition fees. To achieve this goal, private schools must expand the number of free places without limit. If high tuition fees pose a threat of students dropping out of school, and if the attitude of school teachers towards expanding the number of free places does not change, then unrestricted tuition fees in private schools, given the current economic strength of the general public, do pose a great danger of causing a large number of students to drop out of school. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Empathize with the Difficult Times and Show More Sympathy</p>
<p>Now that the semester has already begun, poor students are worried about tuition fees and face many difficulties, wandering on divergent paths, which is very pitiful. In order to implement the resolution of the City Council, the Education Bureau will provide assistance to poor students who request tuition waivers, whether the student applies directly to the school or the Education Bureau forwards a notice, unless the school verifies and proves that they are not poor, in order to ensure that they enjoy free tuition and avoid dropping out of school. Principals and teachers of all schools should also empathize with the difficult times and show more sympathy to poor students, and should not use excuses to evade responsibility or falsely claim that the quota is full and refuse to accept them. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The Responsibility of the Educational Community if a Student Drops Out of School</p>
<p>In short, schools are for nurturing young people, and the responsibility for a student dropping out of school lies with the educational community. "From the one who brought me a bundle of dried meat upwards, I have never refused instruction to anyone," is Confucius' educational spirit. Focusing on the level of tuition fees and the richness of salaries, and viewing the problem of young people dropping out of school as if it has nothing to do with me, is definitely not the attitude that our educational community should have. May all principals, teachers, and staff of our public and private schools, together with the Education Bureau, be vigilant and encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qibao Appointed Director of the Liaison Education Department</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing on the 14th] Cheng Qibao, secretary of the Chinese Committee of the International Liaison Education Organization, has been hired by the International Liaison Education Organization as the Director of the Education Department. Mr. Cheng is scheduled to go to Paris at the end of this month or the beginning of next month to take office.</p>
<h3>Scholarships Awaiting Roster Verification, General Manager of the Unified Review Committee Speaks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Zheng Jie, general manager of the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee, recently some students from various schools have sent letters to the committee requesting that scholarships for this semester be issued in advance, and the committee expresses its deep sympathy for this suggestion. However, in fact, in order to advance the scholarship issuance date, the school authorities must submit the roster of free students for this semester as early as possible, otherwise the committee will not be able to review them in advance. The greatest purpose of the committee's scholarship program is to encourage schools to accommodate as many free students as possible so that they can reach the free quota stipulated by the City Council (20% for private middle schools and 25% for private primary schools), so that all poor students in the city can receive appropriate relief. Therefore, if the committee issues scholarships in advance before the schools submit the roster of free students, it will not only lose the original intention of the committee's scholarship program, but it will also be the same as sending scholarships to schools that generally do not meet the free quota.</p>
<h3>Jianguo School of Law and Commerce Approved for Registration, Northeast Zhongzheng University Discontinued</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing on the 14th] The Ministry of Education has approved the registration of the Nanjing Private Jianguo School of Law and Commerce because it has been operating for more than a year and its equipment, funding, teachers, and other items are satisfactory. In addition, the Shenyang Private Northeast Zhongzheng University has been unable to maintain operations due to the tense situation in the Northeast, the influx of students into the customs, and the school's financial difficulties. The school's board of directors has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for approval to discontinue operations. In addition, the Jilin Provincial Zhongzheng Physical Education College has had no news since it withdrew from Yongji this spring. The Ministry of Education has learned from a report from the Provincial Education Department that it has already been discontinued.</p>

They then traded points, tying at 5-5, 6-6, and 7-7. Lei and Cai made a final push and finally won the first set 9-7. In the second set, Lei's long shots were effective, and Cai's net play was skillful, giving them a 3-1 lead. Zhu and Tao then chased it back to 3-4, but afterwards Zhu's performance became increasingly erratic, and Tao also lost heart, so they lost again 3-6. Lei and Cai qualified for the finals. In another mixed doubles match, Ye Guanxiong and his wife faced Li Guofan and Pan Lüfu. Ye and his wife were effective at the net, but Li and Pan counterattacked with long shots and short blocks, which were quite successful. Ye and his wife won the first set 6-4. In the second set, Ye Guanxiong became slightly careless, allowing the score to tie at 5-5. Li Guofan and Pan Lüfu then used their combined strength to win a set back 7-5.

<h3>Excellent Results on the First Day of the CYMCA Swimming Test</h3>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About Books</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Recently, articles about books have frequently appeared in this publication: airing books, losing books, selling books. However, one rarely sees anyone discussing buying books, which shows the widespread poverty of today's literati. Although most of the contributors to this publication are not professional writers (I suspect), this further illustrates the hardship in the lives of honorable and upright individuals. Before the war, buying a few volumes of the "Modern Series" or other single publications was not difficult. At that time, one U.S. dollar was worth only three yuan. Currently, after the gold yuan conversion, although the ratio is only one to four, the income of the average salaried person is far less than before the war.</p>
<p>Personally, although I have a stable job, I repeatedly pass bookstores without entering. Fortunately, I still have some books in storage. If I read them one by one, I will have several years of entertainment. I must thank myself for running to bookstores during my past, more economically prosperous times. I can still keep two shelves of books to slightly decorate my humble abode today.</p>
<p>Although I enjoyed buying books in the past, I never had a bibliophile's obsession with collecting. Therefore, the number of books I have lost over the years is several times greater than the few dozen I currently possess. Thinking about it now, I feel deep regret. I haven't even kept a few of my own writing and translation works from recent years. However, I often believe that everything is ultimately external, and knowledge should especially belong to the public. Personal book collecting, becoming an obsession, can only be seen as a morbid possessiveness. How can a person digest thousands of books in their lifetime? However, before public libraries become widespread, private collections have their value in preserving cultural artifacts. But if book collecting is viewed as private property, then this significance is lost.</p>
<p>Because I have such views on books, I have never liked buying complete works. Sometimes I only bought the upper or lower volume. Some might find this laughable. But my opinion is that a person's life is limited, and how can one read all the books in the world? And no matter how remarkable an author is, not every book they write is worth reading. Unless one is specifically dedicated to a particular school of thought and knowledge, then reading a person's complete works is quite boring.</p>
<p>Of course, things like complete works have their reference value, even for those who don't specialize in that field. But speaking of reference, it brings to mind the utilitarian view of reading. Those who are good at reference work probably read with a purpose, such as helping with their own writing, teaching materials, and research. Reading with a purpose, although not entirely negative, ultimately belongs to the realm of the concrete. Books and the knowledge they inspire are merely tools for achieving a specific goal in this context, and the spiritual enjoyment is lost. Personally, I believe that the value of books lies precisely in this spiritual enjoyment.</p>
<p>However, due to the pressure of life, opportunities for reading for spiritual enjoyment are becoming fewer and fewer each day. I am even reduced to considering whether a magazine can provide material for writing or translation before buying it. This situation is both hateful and pitiable. Someone once said that "writing books is originally for the sake of rice and beams," but I never thought that even reading would be linked to the need for household rice!</p>
<p>I dare not assume that readers should be aloof and virtuous. If a person wants to take from society, they must also contribute to society, which is fair and reasonable. Therefore, even if reading is linked to utilitarian views, there is nothing shameful about it. Moreover, we have always believed in the saying that "books contain golden houses," "thousands of bushels of grain," and "beautiful women like jade"; the scholar-officials of the imperial examination era considered "excelling in learning leads to officialdom" as self-evident. However, if people have spiritual needs that satisfy themselves beyond their material lives, it cannot be considered an excessive demand, right?</p>
<p>However, this is like a dream today. I have an article clipped from the "New York Times" on my desk, waiting to be "assigned a role." If words have become whips to enslave oneself, then what joy and enjoyment is there in reading!</p>
<h3>Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Mengqiu</p>
<p>I saw an old friend in a restaurant after ten years of separation.</p>
<p>It is certainly a happy occasion, but it is surprisingly difficult to talk as freely as we did ten years ago, laughing without regard for others. Apart from the most cliched greetings, there is simply nothing to say.</p>
<p>The "worldliness" learned in ten years seems to consist of only one sentence: don't hurt others. Therefore, even with people we know very well and crave to see every day, meeting is like two skilled boxers. After the bell rings, everyone tests and tests, avoids and avoids, with deep caution. Occasionally, like a dragonfly skimming the water, there is only a "touch," and then the topic is shifted far away. Or, we stop at a superficial mention.</p>
<p>I can't help but think painfully: Old X, this time it's over. It was a waste for us to have met!</p>
<p>Suddenly, he told me in a leisurely tone that Mr. H had died in the War of Resistance. The unit he joined had fallen into the enemy's trap, and the sacrifices were quite heavy. The face of the shrewd and capable H appeared before my eyes. Such a first-class talent!</p>
<p>I drank silently, forgetting that I was still in a restaurant in Shanghai. Suddenly, I looked up and saw him looking at me too.</p>
<p>There are too many times for acting; even when the mask is taken off, he still thinks I'm acting.</p>
<p>Only "time" can explain everything.</p>
<h3>Bathtub</h3>
<p>— Cangyu</p>
<p>The first bathtub in the United States was shipped from England in 1820. The form of that bathtub is impossible to verify. But many people thought it was a novelty, and its owner, Whitena, displayed it in his front yard for people to visit. In 1842, Thomson, a cotton and grain manager, was the first to install a bathtub in his home. On December 20, 1842, he invited many guests to his home for dinner, followed by bathing. The next day, major newspapers attacked the practice, believing that bathing in a bathtub was harmful to health. Doctors generally insisted on their prejudices, saying that bathing in a bathtub could cause rheumatism, pneumonia, and other diseases. Many people also proposed banning the use of bathtubs, arguing that all households with bathtubs should be taxed 30 yuan per year.</p>
<h3>Song on White Biao's Large Calligraphy in Yun Jian</h3>
<p>— Shen Yuzhong</p>
<p>I praise Uncle Fan's poetry, capable of depicting the marvels of Yun Jian. (Uncle Fan's poem to Bai Jiao praised his calligraphy and painting) Jian is originally a poet, skilled in painting, exhausting his inkstone. Puyong's famous brush gathers in your wrist, orthodox calligraphy can rise to revive the art, a heroic calligrapher is born rarely, so I know that Wang's spirit is now here. Zhong Wang's calligraphy falls into ordinary hands, the pace is cramped and difficult to drive, the common vulgar arguments follow each other, thus the ancestral method is obscured. Watching your large calligraphy spread, the large size is as you wish, it is naturally the original energy in the brushwork, the furnace is in your hands, everything is solid. In recent years, the suffering of war has not yet ended, the brush has no plan to collect the bruise, gathering worries and anger by the wine and lamp, stretching paper and seeing the divine moment. Who in the world will understand the scholar's intentions, what are you doing piling up the retired brushes!</p>
<h3>Poet Yi Ku An</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuogao</p>
<p>Mr. Longyang Yi Ku An has been famous for his poetic talent for a long time, especially his works such as You Yang and Chu Ji, which are extremely exquisite and unparalleled. Master Fang Chong Shen of Tongcheng was a friend of his in the Old Capital Liushuiyin, and their friendship was quite deep. He said that Ku An's poems and lyrics were always composed on the bed, on the toilet, or in the car, either reclining and thinking, or 　藩 writing, or 　軾 obtaining a phrase, all completed instantly, faster than Zi Jian, hence the name "Three Ups."</p>
<p>When he was off duty, he often frequented the flower district, boasting of his romantic escapades. He claimed that in the year of Ren Yin, he was dismissed and sent to Guangxi Youjiang Road. When he took office, he rode in a green sedan chair, with his wife in front and followers behind. Before dusk, on the way to a certain village in Xianggui, he saw a soy milk shop, and the proprietress was looking out the door, with a beautiful and elegant appearance, shining brightly, fully expressing the state of bending over and showing her missing teeth. He then ordered a stop next to the shop and politely asked to stay for the night. The proprietress happily welcomed him, slaughtering chickens and cooking rice, and preparing a bed in the boudoir. In the evening, Ku An raised his glass and drank freely, sending away his servants in the distance, leaving only the woman to serve him. When he was drunk, he showed his intentions, and the woman also thought that he had a dragon-like appearance and a phoenix-like quality, and was very lucky to have met him, so she allowed him to rely on her. At dawn, when he woke up from his drunkenness, he suddenly changed his expression, fearing that it would not be tolerated by her husband. He said: "If this matter is reported, what will happen to my position!" The woman said calmly: "It doesn't matter. My husband knows that you are a noble person, and he feels honored that you have visited our humble home. He doesn't mind these details." After a while, her husband actually willingly stayed outside, working as usual. Afterwards, Ku An often told people about this, always calling it the most satisfying thing in his life.</p>
<p>In the early Republic of China, disasters occurred frequently in a certain province, and sorrowful cries were heard everywhere. A charity sale was held at the Old Capital Natong Flower Garden, and all the famous ladies and girls of Pingjin gathered there. Mrs. Xiong Xiling, Tang Zaili, and others were all invited to participate. Ku An and Han Yun also went together. The next morning, the newspaper published poems about a certain event, actually listing the two ladies as famous courtesans, with a poem attached to each. At that time, Zaili was in power, and when he found out, he was furious and mobilized his forces, finally causing Ku An to flee to Tianjin and disappear for almost a month.</p>
<p>When Yuan Xiangcheng was in power, he went to the Old Capital again to assist Yuan Bo 　 (Siliang) and served as a counselor in the Printing Bureau. Every weekend, he would go to Tianjin and Gu, visiting the courtesan Li Sangu, and their relationship was very close, with frequent visits. At that time, the Donganshi photography studio in the Old Capital had a huge portrait of Sangu hanging there; Ku An would often sit alone in the 　 surface noodle shop, staring at it intently for a long time. Observing the contemporary women described in his collection, all of them were said to be beautiful enough to overthrow kingdoms and as beautiful as red clouds, but when he actually saw them, most of them had repulsive faces, either Dong Shi or Wu Yan. Could it be that he was implicitly implying the meaning of a colorful brush creating flowers? I remember that Uncle Cheng Zida (Song Wan) of Ningxiang, who had a marriage relationship with him, wrote a tomb inscription and a catalog of his collections for him, repeatedly praising Ku An as a man of benevolence in the world, knowing to abide by the rules, but at the end of the article, there was a sentence "receiving prostitutes, like eating and drinking, cannot be abolished," which probably refers to what Master Chong Shen said? Ku An's name was Shun Ding, his style name was Shifu, also Zhongshi, and because he mourned the death of his mother, weeping like ointment, he was named Ku An.</p>
<h3>About Gromyko</h3>
<p>— Yungong</p>
<p>Recently, I read in the newspaper that Mrs. Lappin, the director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, flew from the United States to Shanghai to reunite with her husband. Mrs. Lappin is energetic, a capable wife, and quite famous in American social circles. One day, Soviet Foreign Minister and former UN Representative Gromyko met Mrs. Lappin at a banquet. Mrs. Lappin asked him, "What do you think of American women?" Gromyko replied with a straight face, "They make no impression on me." Seeing that the conversation was not going well, Mrs. Lappin was about to turn away when Gromyko immediately explained, "Mrs. Lappin, I was joking with you."</p>
<p>In addition, there are several humorous remarks by Gromyko circulating in the American press. For example:</p>
<p>Someone asked him what he thought of a feature article about him in the New York Times. He replied that half of it was true and half was fiction because the New York Times is a moderate newspaper, and this report was to be expected.</p>
<p>When he heard someone mention his youth, he retorted, "How many years do you have to live in America to be considered 'old'?"</p>
<p>One time, an American reporter called his home, and his daughter answered. The reporter asked to speak to her father. She replied, "He's not home."</p>
<p>"Do you know where he went?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I never know where he is. He has never mentioned a word about his movements in front of me."</p>
<h3>Polo</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Han Yu and Zhang Jianfeng played polo, and there were poems and petitions given to Zhang. Polo was a military exercise, especially to train riding skills; the method is not detailed, but it must be riding a horse to chase the ball, hitting it with a stick, the ball is not big, but very strong. Today, Westerners have a horse polo game, I wonder if it is the same as our ancient method. There is no horse polo in the National Games, because the original skills have long been lost, and there is also a preference for imitating others. Reading Mr. Han's poems, you can still imagine the heroism of the Tang people. The poem says, "Building a court a thousand steps flat as a knife, three sides of short walls circling, "this is the polo court. "Hundreds of horses gather their hooves and reflect each other, the ball startles the stick and separates," again, "leaning to the side and turning the arm to the horse's belly, the thunder should be in the hand of the divine pearl galloping," the hitting method is roughly like this. The second letter to Zhang Puye says, "Those who say polo is harmful must say that there are worries about dangerous roads and fears of shooting, the small ones hurt the face, the big ones damage the body," again, "Using it (referring to the horse) to play polo in the arena, shaking the heart and lungs, vibrating the muscles and bones, the breath cannot come in and out, the walking cannot be returned, the far ones three or four years, the near ones one or two years, there are no whole horses, then the harm of polo to people is decided. This is the real view of ancient scholars, all competitions must have small harms to people, if you see the small harm and do not see the big benefit, then you say that sports games should be abolished, it is really ignorant. However, exercise should avoid excess, his argument about horses is right, today the British make this game, people must prepare three or four horses, about fifteen minutes to change horses once.</p>
<h3>Lessons from Traffic Safety Campaign</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Authorities are again promoting a traffic safety campaign these past few days. The annual "Traffic Safety Week" has been around for several years, but although it cannot be said to be completely superficial, the results are far from what was expected. Traffic congestion in busy areas remains the same, and vehicle accidents are still frequently heard. These are all in urgent need of improvement and greater effort. The small American city of East also used to be a traffic-congested city. This small city with a population of only 70,000, because of its proximity to Chicago, has the traffic of a metropolis with a population of 500,000. But through the efforts of Franklin Klim, who came from the ranks of traffic police on duty, the city was able to go without a single traffic fatality in 1945. And in four years, it won the "National Safety Council" award three times, being recognized as the safest city of the same size.</p>
<p>Klim's first task was to appoint a qualified expert as a "traffic engineer" to focus on the problem of speeding up traffic congestion.</p>
<p>He first persuaded the merchants on the main road to carry out loading and unloading operations between midnight and 6 a.m., because loading and unloading goods during the day is a major cause of traffic obstruction. The merchants complied, and the traffic situation immediately improved significantly.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. K appealed for the cooperation of employers to stagger the hours of work, not everyone leaving work at the same time. In this way, the peak of traffic congestion that occurs when people leave work is reduced.</p>
<p>For the safety of pedestrians, the police politely used loudspeakers to discourage them from crossing red lights, crossing intersections at oblique angles, or crossing the street in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>At intersections, the curbs were rounded to make it easier and faster for drivers to turn. Several roads were restricted to one-way traffic only, increasing both traffic capacity and speed.</p>
<p>The changes in traffic lights are timed so that cars traveling at 27 miles per hour will encounter a green light at every intersection. Parking on narrow streets is allowed on one side only, and parking time in busy areas is reduced from one hour or one and a half hours to half an hour.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. K has become a university "professor". He is the Dean of the Traffic Academy at Northwestern University. There are nearly 2,000 graduates, distributed in various states in the United States and Central America and Canada, specializing in solving traffic problems.</p>

<h3>Reader Mr. Zheng Urgently Seeks Employment</h3>
<p>To the Editor: After graduating from the Department of Industrial Management, I was employed as the Director of Affairs and a Chinese Language teacher at a British secondary school. My income was sufficient to cover my wife's midwifery training expenses and the living expenses of my two children. Unexpectedly, the supervisor was transferred this semester, and I lost my job, which has resulted in my wife being unable to complete her one year of schooling and the hunger of my two children is even more unbearable! I respectfully write this letter to ask your newspaper to publish it in the social services column. If a kind person could introduce a job to me so that I can maintain a livelihood and support my wife's studies, I will definitely work hard to repay them. If there are letters of sympathy and assistance, please leave them at the service column of your newspaper! Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zheng Shizhen, September 5</p>
