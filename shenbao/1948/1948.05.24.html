<h3>東京美官方表示　決不扶植日軍事　對各會事華府甚表冷漠</h3>
<p>〔合眾社駐亞洲副社長房恩東京廿三日電〕東京美國最高方面告記者稱：美國重建日本之計劃，目的非僅在使日人能有差堪滿意之生活水準，且在婚進全體亞洲人民乏生活水準。來克沃塞元帥從未想及虧待中國或亞洲其他國家，而由美國專誠援助日本。麥帥及車擬美國政策諸人，均以爲日本之復興應與全體亞洲國家之經濟繁榮一視同仁。中國報紙有稱，藥國之援日，將危反中國之經濟復興，是後將造成日本軍國主義重振。高級美人就此評稱：「中國受損甚重，故中國之以懷疑眼光觀察美國援日計劃，實係自然之事，然中國人士之上述論調則誤矣。美國已採取一切措施，務使日本從此無法再度推行軍事政治或經濟侵略」。記者與麥帥會晤談多次，麥帥絕對感到中國不僅在遠東即在全球事務上均有樂足輕重之勢。麥帥絕對不肯特待中國或其他國家，而發展日本。麥師所希望者嚴爲經濟政治計劃，以促使亞洲各國合作，師叔促進亞洲國家與舉世各國在經濟上合作。</p>

<h3>封鎖匪區經濟問題</h3>
<p>發展絨濟之嬝要條件，不外一個通字。不論是金融，是貿易，是生　，是運輸，如果這個條件不能具備，或具而太不充分，則一切經濟事業，斷　顯利發　·故金融首　流　，貿易亦稱通商，物資變交流，　轉要迅捷　總不外在這個　字上做功夫。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，因爲車事上，財政上，金融上種種理由，一切措施，往往載着相反的方向走去。對外匯兌國國際貿易姑不論，單論國內，則如匯兌，運鈔，貸款，票據抵用，和開設行莊等等，都有限制，是金融通通，其範圍已很有限，而許多貨品的流轉，各級政府又往往多設禁令，不許其自由販　，另有若干貨品，則在統購或定購等方式下，早又成了某種集團的蔡變，其在極種情式的管制下，凡屬運銷，收購，生產，儲存，必須受到某極程度的限制的，尤其餘事。所以現在的經濟政策，表面上，儘管說是促進流通，而實際上，種種人爲的極　部分，早已令人頭痛腦脹了。</p>
<p>自從共匪狼奔豕突，到處竄擾，中央爲防止物資資匪，和斷絕其　濟來源起見，於去年春起，會頒佈匪區交通經濟封鎖辦法，住接近戰區地帶，實行經濟封鎖。這原是不得已的措置。又以上海爲工商業中心，共匪希岡偷運物資，前往接濟，經軍警當局屢次破壞有案，上項封鎖辦法，因有在滬推行之議。值此動員　亂時期，軍事第一，這當然也是必要的舉動。我們要達成戡亂的任務，不得不在經濟上予以致命的打擊，要在經濟上打擊敵人，又不得不防止物資資敵，以斷絕眞經濟來源。爲遠成這項重大的任務起見，縱使暫時忍受若干　牲和不便，諒想大家也必樂於織受的。</p>
<p>但爲減少種種不必要的麻煩起見，這裹却要提出若干實見？，要求當局事前加以蠶分響　。那說是。</p>
<p>（一）封鎖綫問題　劍是何等地幣應當賞施封鎖。封鐵的主旨　，既在於防止物資流入匪區，所以接近匪區，和物資可以　往的交界處所，廳置是理想的封鎖綫；其他不接近匯區，和物資不能直接運往的地帶，似乎應當除外。因爲這等地帶，既與匪區並無交通，則凡所封鎖的，自然不是運往匪區的物資，而是我們自己運用的物資了。這項自用物資，如果連帶地加以禁運，監查，或領證，許可等手續，徒然增加商民的麻煩，而與原來所定防止資匪這目的無關。</p>
<p>（二）採購證問題　封鎖宗旨，既在於防止資匪，則凡一切可以資匪的物資，自應悉予禁運，其或有特別原因，例外予以許可的，當然應予證明，以便過境。其從匪區搶運物資出境的，其作用與斷絕匪區的經濟來源同，論理亦應予鼓勵。至於在滬辦貨，運往非匪區，或從非匪區辦貨運到上海，這與封鎖匪區辦法全無干涉，我們以爲除法令另有規定外，亦不需要任何手續。</p>
<p>（三）物品種類問題　依照院頒匪區父通經濟封鎖辦法第五條之規定，凡物資金融，限制其通過封鎖綫的，應由當地軍政機關，規定其種類，名稱，及數量，即此可知並非一切物品概予禁運。所以何種物品，何等數量，列在　例，應按照實際情形，分別詳爲擬定，先期明白公告，使商民有所適從。否則商民將隨時隨地可以被指爲犯禁，而徒爲不肖　吏門其　詐盤剎之門。</p>
<p>以上三點而外，如封鎖綫任務的如何執行，以及一切留難　索等不良風氣的如何防止，這當然是上下一致關心的問題·抗戰時期，不論團方後方，這些痛苦的教調，物給人們的印　太深了，　前　後，我們相信，當局對此，當有完善的規劃。</p>
<p>現在經濟上的極指，有如上文所述，已經覺得太多了。經濟封鎖，關係　亂計　，　不得不努力奉行，但在經濟界陷於極度困難之秋，凡屢不必要的障　和束縛，我們總希望極力減輕至最少限度，以免加迪其惡化。上海又是我國惟一大都市，人口已增加到五百萬，一切生活必需之品，大部份固必須仰給於內地，而各類商品，和各工廠所需要的原料，以及製盛後的各類產品又不得不與各地互相交流，以維持其整個的體系。所以在實施這封鎖辦法以前，究應如何統籌兼顧，悉心規劃，期於維護工商業的生命之中，獲得封鎖的最大效果，這確是值得大家　重研討的一個重大間題。否則匪區還沒有真正封鎖，而我們自已的工意反飽嘗了扼殺的痛苦，我們自己的民生反遭受了嚴重的迫書。</p>
<p>現在往往有許多政策，初意原屬未可厚非，而施行的結果竟適得其反，徒爲執行政策者多開發財的門徑。我們所以不憚詞費，喚起政府和社會往意這個封鎖匯區經濟問題者，就是爲此。</p>

<h3>飛遍半個中國　航程七千餘哩　積石山探險後的旅行</h3>
<p>— 本報記者洪絮才</p>
<p>是幸運？是巧合？抑是一個不可求的機綠？記者由於參加央航公司的積石山探測隊，獲得了跑遍半個中國的機會，飽覽了華中，華西，華南和西北部的風光。統計飛越的省份有江蘇，安徽，湖北，陝西，甘肅，胥海，西康，新　，湖南，江西，廣東，廣西，福建，浙江，台灣，以及香港利海南島。</p>
<p>記者是於四月十五日，搭乘央航探測機到達蘭州的，十六日飛積石山高空探測後，原定翌日飛成都轉重慶，搭班機返滬，那架探測專機呢，則由央航公司的高級負責人飛往各地分公司視察業務之用，記者有幸，得擠入了「視察」的隊伍、到處飛翔，十天之中，到過的地方有：漢口，西安，蘭州，成都，重慶，柳州，廣州，香港海南島，汕頭，　門，合南，台北福州，總計十日間，空中飛航時間四十小時，航程運七千餘哩。</p>
<p>事後想來，這眞是個不可思議的奇蹟，要在短短的十天中，完成這樣漫長的旅程，是求之而不可得的。假如試把旅費計算一下，在飛機票如是昂貴的目前，恐怕爲數需以億計，而且乘客擁擠，航綫有限，在平時欲跑遍這許多地方，眞是談何容易，要不知道要耗費多少時間。這次央航視察專機由副理陳文寬親自駕駛，可以爲業務上的需要，隨時隨地升降，除了天氣以外，就不受任何拘束，這自然是所以能在短時期中飛長距離的主要因素。</p>
<p>記者會試算央航這一次爲視察各地業務所消耗的費用，僅就專機而言，已相當可觀，搬開專機應有的日有生產額不說，單是這次旅程的汽油，就已經很驚人了。按飛機每小時平均須用油一百加侖，四十小時計耗汽油四千加侖，以上海的價格每加侖二十六萬元計算，全程汽油價即在十億以上，何況內地的汽油價要比上海的貴一倍，運費雜費尚一概不加計算。無怪央航公司那位年已古稀的工程師　錦朝對記者說：「我們在公司工作了二十年，才候得這樣</p>
<p>一個闊綽的好機會，竟然給你碰上了，眞是好大的運氣！一</p>
<p>此番隨機同行的，有央航副經理鄧誥章和陳文寬，總工程師杭效祖，溫聯棟，　錦朝，副機師鄭杰池，通訊員薛應年，民航局業務處長蕭立坤，和記者等九人。我們的行程是這樣的：四月十五日自上海龍華機塲起飛，在漢口及西安降落加油後，當晚抵蘭州，留宿西北招待听。翌日下午一時飛續石山探測，晚八時回蘭，與張治中，郭寄橋將軍招特晚宴。十穴日晨，探測機就載着記者飛成都轉重慶，改搭班機返滬，所以參加積石山探測的各報記者，十七日即安返上海。記者隨行的央航視察業務專機呢，於十七日飛柳州，停留僅一頓飯的時間，即飛慶州，當晚由廣州市長歐陽駒招待晚餐，劊宿當田地的國際大飯店愛羣旅社。翌日午直飛香港，降落九龍啓德機傷，香港畢竟是個好地方，外省人一到那裹，就立時戀上了，另一方面，也是因爲鄧副理霸於業務上的繁忙，所以我們在香港返留的時間最久，計二一天四夜。到廿二日，專機特飛海南島，作半日遨遊，在海口大同酒家初　廣東菜，其味無窮，這充滿熱帶風情的島嶼，着實供給記者不少寫昨上新鮮的資料，當逐一報道．從海南島歸來，在麗池夜總會度過香島最後的一晚，二十三日晨直飛汕頭，謁汕頭市長李國俊，李市長並陪同記者游覽中山公圍。當天下午飛廈侖門，留宿遙對鼓浪嶼的大新旅社。二十四日淸早直飛台南轉台北，午飯後，轉福州返滬。在福州，央航站主任林顯明夫婦還特備豐盛的福州土菜，記者等得遍嚐沿海名餚，專機於當日晚十時許降落龍華機場。</p>
<p>此行中，記者自蒙藏沙漠遴緣的黃土帶，到柏油路最整潔的冒險家樂園—香港，從地理距離說，是從祖國最中心的蘭州，越南海到地圖上最南端的半島，在氣候上的差別，是從零度以下十二度的高空，到達沸點以上的亞熱帶，至於風土人情的區別，更形顯著，從　素，單調，　實，和貧困的西北，到充滿異國情調，　樂的靑島，再領略到日光風光籠罩之下台灣的東洋色彩，沿途所見所聞雖屬不少，但是因爲各地停留時間短促，走馬靑花，膚淺不深入，自屬難免。但亦由於此，却沒有在某一地處　久了而產生的麻木感，記者來去忽忽，而對各地的觀感足敏捷的，對每個地方的生活程度，社會秩序，治安情形，和風俗習慣等，易於聯想而產生強烈的對照，職責所在，自當逐漸加以整理發表，以　讀者。</p>
<p>玆特將此次飛行的路綫，距離，和時間等摘錄，以供參考：</p>
<p>航程　飛行時間</p>
<p>上海—漢口　四三四哩　二小時零四十分鐘</p>
<p>漢口—西安　四一二哩　二小時零三十五分鐘</p>

<h3>蘇聯駁覆美國聲明　指美助日本重建作戰力量　裁軍未能獲協議歸咎於美</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕此問官方今日宣稱，蘇聯之和平攻勢，不致　影響美國外交政策。蘇聯今後可能採取兩種行動，即將聯合國機構若干主要問題作讓步，以顯其有設法解決之見意，同時加緊全面宣傳，炫示史達林總理與外長莫洛托夫希望談判並結束冷戰，而杜魯門總統興國務部長馬歇爾則阻撓此項企圖。塔斯社最近發表聲明指斥美國現政府之便略政策，足見蘇聯或將運循第二種路綫行事。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿三日電〕蘇聯昨又將聯合國機構及外長會議中關於眾備原子能及德日和約問題之僵局，以及朝鮮之遲遲不能獨立，歸咎於美國。莫斯科電臺晨播塔斯社之聲明，提出前項意見，調係蘇聯領袖人士之意見，意在答覆美國務部對史達林元帥之答華萊士公開信所發表之聲明。塔斯社之聲明指出外長會議及聯合國機構之不能就前項間題獲致協議，實綠美國堅決反對蘇聯各項建議之故。塔斯社特別指出波斯坦協定，規定對日和約應由外長會議準備，並指美國支援日本之侵略系，重建日本之經濟能力，以打擊和平。關於駐華之外國軍隊事，塔斯社指出蘇聯軍隊己撤出中國，而美軍則否，中國內戰之擴大顯因美軍逗留中國之故。關於朝鮮問題，搭斯社聲明由於美國採取反民主政策，支援反動及親日團體，因此使美蘇不能就朝鮮之獨立獲得協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿二日電〕塔斯社發表公報，答復美國務部五月十九日關於美蘇關係之聲明，內控告美政府不斷破壞諸種國際協定，包括雅爾達德黑蘭及波次坦等。美國並遵背聯大之決議，而實行軍備競賽政策。蘇聯會提出有關管制原子軍備之多種建議，但均遭國務部所拒斥。該項公報繼複提及妨礙蘇美邦交之各項問題，諸如德日和約。撇退駭中國及朝鮮之外軍隊，尊重願家主權·美千涉義大利選舉·美在聯合國會員國領土設立軍專基地等。塔斯社指出美國保有此等基地，益增國際之不安。關於國外貿易及歐洲復興，塔斯社稱，蘇聯會提出在聯合國機構內進行歐洲復興工作之建議，但亦　美政府所拒絕，美國又在希臘及其他等國散佈親法西斯之思想。塔斯社結語稱，準上所述，目前局勢責任誰屬，不言自明矣。美國現巳摒棄羅斯福政策而不斷破壞各種國際協定，下僅背叛聯合國憲章，且亦忽視聯合國組織，此等態度決不能改善國際關係。</p>
<h3>華萊士再度廣播演說　向美外交主持人挑戰　要求就現行政策舉行辯論</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓州斯北克恩廿二日電〕華萊士今日在廣播中向參議員范登堡以及馬　爾或參議員康納利桃戰，希望能舉行一連串之辯諭，商討聯合國外交政策，華氏自稱以第三　總統候選人之身份向共和民主兩黨外交政策主持人挑戰。</p>
<p>渠稱「過去兩週中，蘇聯政府兩度營應美國之建議，認爲進行　　結束冷戰之時機已至。乃政　及民主共和兩黨政客皆向人民　　東冷戰之熱望，潑上一盆冷水。政府宣稱「吾人爲此已屢次談判，吾人已倦於再事談判矣。</p>
<p>但人民則稱「吾人前時已爲是項目標作戰，吾人已倦於作戰矣，吾人所需要者厥爲和平。」</p>
<p>〔路透社西雅圖廿二日電〕美　　總統侯選人華萊士今日表小，渠覺美國應以公允的熊度，在公開會議中請蘇聯制止共產主義在其他國家內之伸展。但渠又　宣布　國破壞效果的方法爲非法，力美蘇採取任何共同行動的弟一步。渠在電台廣播答間時，被詢及渠如當選總統，將以何法與蘇見取協定時，答曰，渠認整個間題應由美蘇兩國政府開會處埋。彼詢及共產黨是否支持渠之競選總統時，答曰，任何主張以暴力推翻美國政府者，如願予渠以支持，渠當斷然予以拒絕。</p>

<h3>美蘇戰爭潛力</h3>
<p>— 翁紹裘譯</p>
<p>蘇聯現正奮力於控制整個歐洲。美國過去二次戰爭，均爲阻止敵國控制歐洲，目前正準備制出蘇聯作　進一步的擴張，必要時將不惜一戰。</p>
<p>美國的傳統政策，在於制止任何國家單獨統治歐洲，因爲統治歐洲大陸以後，便獲得造船的便利，同時獲得向美國本土及西方國家挑戰的基地。所以目前蘇聯如直接控制西歐各國，或者似手各國共產黨挖制西歐，都會引起美國恐懼蘇聯空軍可能以西歐爲基地。</p>
<p>基於上述背景，蘇聯控制整個歐洲的計劃如獲成功，則美蘇戰爭勢將不可避免。</p>
<p>美蘇的戰爭潛力如下：</p>
<p>人力是戰爭開始時最重要的條件，蘇聯將壓倒美國。蘇聯及隊洲的工業工人總數將達四千五百九十三萬人，美國則僅有二千三百十五萬人，甚至於包括加拿大·澳洲及英國在內，也比不上蘇聯。</p>
<p>鋼：蘇聯及歐洲每年能產鋼五千四百噸，美國每年則能產鋼幾千噸，但並非全部能立即作爲戰爭用途。所以蘇聯短少的數量，並無數目字上所表示者之大。</p>
<p>煤：歡洲及蘇聯如協力生產，每年可產煤五億八千噸，美國每年產煤六億八千三百噸。</p>
<p>淡氣：戰時需要淡氣，作爲爆炸及糧食生產之用，蘇聯及歐洲每年能製造一百三十萬噸，數量約等於美國的產量。</p>
<p>錢器工具：戰爭工業所需要的機器工具，蘇聯將有機器工具二千七百五十萬件，美國僅有三千萬件，但美國的配備比蘇聯精良。</p>
<p>蘇聯如控制歐洲全部時，工業力量將比目前增加一倍，但是在全面戰爭下的工業所牽連的問題，蘇聯將無法解決，甚至於全力生產時，蘇聯及歐洲的生產效率，仍在美國之下。</p>
<p>莫斯科的眞正問題，是在奪獲歐洲工業及人力以後，如何予以充分利用。</p>
<p>石油：在現代戰爭中，石油最爲重要，這是蘇聯困難之處。西歐的交通網，需要大量的石油，但蘇聯及歐洲均難以供應。蘇聯及歐洲每年最多能出產石浪二億六千七百桶，美國每年部能出產十九億二千桶。</p>
<p>蘇聯如控制歐洲全部以後，需要向南美加里比安海·中東及荷印等地區購買大量石油，但美國空軍能以迅雷不及掩耳的姿態，迅速切斷上列石油的來源。蘇聯如奪取中東油田，好處甚少，因爲無法將油運出，中東石油必須假道地中海，但英美海軍必控制地中海。</p>
<p>另一方面，蘇聯旣無空軍又無海軍力量，能切斷美國石汕的來源。</p>
<p>戰爭爆發以後，美國能向世界各地獲得戰爭的主要原料，但蘇聯則僅能向其控制的地區獲得原料，其他的原料來源，必被美國空軍及海軍切斷。</p>
<p>蘇聯所缺乏的主要戰爭原料如下：</p>
<p>鋁：鋁是製造飛機炸彈及戰門艦隊的原料，美國所製造的鋁；超過蘇聯及歐洲所能製造者極巨。歐洲大陸每年僅能產鋁三十八萬噸，但美國每年可產一百二十三萬噸，再加上加拿大所生產的五十萬噸，則美國與蘇聯鋁的產量對比是五比一。</p>
<p>銅：銅是製造任何軍備的主要原料，美國產量也比蘇聯地區豐富。蘇聯及歐洲每年能產銅三十萬五千噸，美國產量等於上數三倍。</p>
<p>技術人才及工業管理人才的缺乏，也是蘇聯的致命傷。假如歐洲工業能護得原料時，蘇聯的工業生產量是否能與希特勒所生產數量相接近，實屬疑問。因爲希特勒有一批工業管理及技術人才，蘇聯則缺乏這種專家，同時西歐被佔領後，也不願與蘇聯合作。</p>
<p>交通缺乏，是蘇聯另一種障礙，一旦戰爭發生，這種陣礙不久即表現出來。貫通於東歐及西歐間的主要鐵路綫僅有三條，由於德國東部第二條鐵路移去，所以三條交通綫已削弱。</p>
<p>美國空軍能由英國，中東及北非起飛，轟炸歐洲大陸整個交通網。</p>
<p>多瑙河是隊洲大陸唯一的水路，貫通西歐及蘇聯，每年運輸量爲二百萬噸，但美國空軍投落之水雷，必嚴重打擊這一條交通綫。蘇聯要接濟法國及義大利，必須假道地中海，但美國海軍及空軍一定予以封鎖</p>
<p>糧食及衣服缺乏，更是戰爭開始時蘇聯的困難，同時削弱歐洲力量，不可能延長戰爭。</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，蘇聯及區洲由美洲及北非運人的糧食來源，必定告絕，蘇聯及其附庸國不能彌補糧食的損失。同時因交通受騷擾，如果有糧食時，也不可能運輸，結果必影呼工業，因爲工人沒有充足糧食，工價效率必急劇降落。</p>
<p>衣服的情況將比糧食更爲嚴重，如果衣服來源告絕，歐洲及務聯平民必幾乎不能獲得任何織造品，反之，美國的糧食及衣服來源無處。</p>
<p>總之，根擄上述事實，蘇聯控製歐洲後，設計人員一定立即開發西歐經濟，蘇聯控制歐洲，在工業上所增加的力量，可能大於當年希特勒發動二次大戰時的工業力量，但仍然比美國脆弱。正像玩紙牌戯一般，蘇聯對美國的鬥爭如延長時，對他不利的紙牌，一定大量堆積起來。（譯自美國新聞及世界報導混合週刊）</p>

<h3>五洲旅社命案女屍身世查明　兇手為死者丈夫　神經錯亂下毒手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕廣東路五一七號五洲旅社內，於本月九日午後，發生靑年女客被殺藏屍床下慘案，屍身發現情形，曾誌前報。茲悉此案經該管老閘警局於事後四出偵查，並偕同旅社茶役鄧其保，乘輪赴海門各地追查凶手，迄未拘獲。據悉兇手兪星柏，廿三歲，家住海門文武鄕一區八甲十三戶，其父兪士鑫，在西門大街一一一號與人合夥開有福泰五金雜貨號，士鑫共生五子，兇手俞星柏為長子，前畢業於海門中學，後考入强華職業學校肄業，未及一月，因品行不良，被校開除，賦閑居家，旋與鄰居沈張氏之女沈珠鳳發生噯昧，曾向父要求娶沈女爲妻，兪士鑫因嫌沈家貧窮，竭力反對，致星柏精神上受刺激頗深，一度與女偕逃，即爲沈母尋獲，並向兪家大興問罪之師。旋由兪之叔父出而轉園，右情人乃得終成眷屬。本年淸明，兪星柏擬來滬經商，向其父借得棉紗一件，售得一億餘元，作爲資本，即偕沈女來滬，同居在五洲旅社內，豈知忽於本月九日發生慘劇。警局偵查結果，認爲可能因兇手一時神經錯亂而下比毒手。當本月十三日，該局曾接報吿，知江灣農林部荒地上，有一靑年自殺，其年齡容貌極似兇手，即派員將屍棺扣留，移送常德路驗屍所，開棺相驗，結果則認明並非兪星柏，現該局仍在繼續追緝中。</p>

<h3>孫田昌植案　新罪證待發掘　謀得利廠地下埋有大批刺刀　兩犯今日解京審究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前以資敵軍火嫌疑被人檢舉後經軍事法庭宣判無罪之棘人孫田昌植，最近復被人向國防部密吿隱匿軍用物資，經國防部派員來滬會同憲兵第九團澈查，果在惠民路前英商謀得利琴行牆壁夾層內搜出銅元五十七箱，又在陝西北路某倉庫內搜出砲兵用之觀測器數十具。孫田昌植現由憲兵第九團覊押中。本案密吿人據悉係孫任謀得利廠長時之手下職員及工人，其密吿中除上述銅元及軍用觀測器外，尙有大批刺刀，據稱係由孫田昌植藏匿於謀得利廠址地下，當初會掘地洞十一處埋藏，地面則全部用水泥舖蓋。現負責澈查本案之國防部人員對於發掘此項刺刀頗感棘手，因該處地面早已用水泥肺平，埋藏刺刀之十一處地洞位置究竟何在，殊難確定。且該謀得利琴行廠址現已爲美領事館產業，勢難將全部廠址翻掘。負責人員爲此日內即將返京請示，孫日昌植及其同時被逮之助手尹鐘弼今日解京審訊。又開於搜獲之銅元及觀測器，前於眾事法庭審訊孫田昌植時，檢舉人亦曾提及，後因軍事法庭未能將此項物件查獲，乃以罪證不足理由宣判無罪。現物證旣經查出，可能舊案重翻，並將牽涉前負責檢察及審訊者。據悉國防部人員已將孫田昌植前在高等法院及軍事法庭受審之全部案卷調閱云。</p>

<h3>漁管處兩輪出口　鴨窩沙表演打魚</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕復興島在藏金案裏嶄露頭角，雖然事過境遷，但當記者穿越這塊沃土時，總還有些異樣感覺，金子固然沒有發現，可是價値更超過黃金的物資，却堆得滿地皆是，但就沒有人獲悉這些物資爲什麼不被發掘出來的底蘊，誰多在輕輕嘆惜！</p>
<p>漁管處裏有堆得如山樣高的洋松，帆布，蔴繩，器械，據說要待漁業善後物資保管委員會在下月召集沿海合省市政府和漁業代表舉行會議後，才可發給木料，製造船隻，以及撥配一切裝備，但是時間還嫌得太遲，我們不是見到日本人的漁船，已經有二百對，在我們的外海領域裏，越俎代庖了嗎。這類事常有發現，日本船變看見我們的漁船，甚至會扔掉了漁網逃逸，但逃逸了是會再來的，唬嚇究沒有實力的抗拒來得澈底。</p>
<p>一綱拉起空無所有</p>
<p>為了實際明　漁撈作業，漁管處特地派了大十隻美國漁船中的「威司康業」與「佛琴尼」兩艘，載了記者們駛赴吳淞口外。船長說：通常機船捕魚，要駛出吳淞口外四小時模樣，才能從海底裏獵得魚羣，因爲時間不許可，兩條船在鴨窩沙就停了下來，作爲一種「表演」，這時候沒有風浪，漁網在準三時四十分，從「佛琴尼」號的甲板上卸到了混淘淘的江水裏，漸漸地拖遠，下沉，最後便在船舷兩側放下木板，張開了網口，大家多在等待一種歡躍，但不到十五分鐘，捲楊機就開始起網，船員穿着像救火員一樣的衣服，分三段拖上了濕淋淋的魚網，結果「袋筒」（盛魚的末端）裏一無所有，當無綫電話裏傳來對船同樣的說話時，大家多失望了。船長又解釋說：他們捕魚在深海裏進行，一網下去，至少要二三小時才拉起來，何况鳴窩沙的魚，早就給每天穿梭不斷的往來船隻嚇跑了。</p>
<p>漂泊大海歷盡艱險</p>
<p>他們述說眞切的漁撈工作是够動人的，當風雨晦冥，獨浪排空的時候，一葉小舟，漂蕩在無際無涯的大海裏，那才是恐怖，尤其在風狂浪駭裏，起網時被打掉牙齒或斷手折足是常有的事，至於被捲　海裏的，也不少。聽說有一次在外海　引擎失靈，要拋錨又爲風浪所阻，於是由一個外國船員和中國船員搖舢板將錨帶出去，結果這位外國船員一去未回。很少人明白這些艱辛，他們說每一次出海總在十天左右才回來，而每天多工作二十四小時，拿生命來和風浪肉搏，可是當人們夾着一筷「醋溜黃魚」的時候，誰知道盤中的魚，條條皆辛苦呢？</p>
<p>黃魚過處駭人鉅響</p>
<p>說起黃魚每年在淸明節後的兩個月裏，是一期旺汎，一網打起幾萬斤是司空見慣的，甚至會多得拉不上船，再「放生」一些。黃魚羣雄的追逐着雌的，在大海裏遊過，能有一種駭人的鉅響，但據說今年不曾發現到這個集團的焦點，漁管處本年三，四兩月捕到三百二十萬斤，時値八七六億元，但和往年比較，就差得太遠了。</p>
<h3>精緻的廚房間　柔軟的席夢思</h3>
<p>這裏需要介紹這兩條漁船，它們和其他的美國漁船同樣有着高度優越的性能，平均多在一二〇噸左右，二五〇匹馬力，每小時能駛九海里，一船的魚容量最多時可載一百噸，裏面的設備有隨時可與各船通話的無綫電話，急救藥品一應俱全，而精緻的廚房，柔軟的席夢思。</p>
<p>誠如漁管處的負責人說，從鴨綠江口直到最南端的東京灣止，這樣遙遠的海岸綫，配備一百二十六隻機動漁船，（善後物資美船六十隻，澳洲船六十六隻），實在渺小得可憐，這只能說是中國機船捕魚的一個開始，所希望的是能在這脆弱的陣容裏，建立起永世不拔的漁業基礎。</p>

<h3>一股物價　當局頻施壓力　物價漲風稍戢</h3>
<p>本年物價的走勢，自三月份第二週一度掀起大漲風後，直至四月抄，始終維持比較穩定的狀態，盤旋前進，此種過程，歷時約七週之久。</p>
<p>自五月份上半月起，即上週前之第一二兩週，週期性之漲風，再度開始，就本刊所編按用途分類之物價指數觀之，計五月份第一週總指數上升百分之九·二一，第二週上升百分之二七·八二，當局隨即密切注意，頻施壓力，圖謀遏止。</p>
<p>上週即即承此種趨勢之後，政府一面拋售物資，一面抽緊銀根，一般物價，漲風已漸展緩，雖漲落參差，榮辱互見，但幅度已較狹隘，計總指數僅上升百分之一·二〇。</p>
<p>上週銀根頗緊，國行交換，週三四均差進在萬億以上，暗息亦頗紊亂，自三角以至四角餘不等。港匯行情，自週初起，在逐漸趨縮中。茲將上週各項有關物價因素，約略分析如次：</p>
<p>第一，政府於前週漲風中之拋　物資政策，上週仍繼續執行。週一紡建公司除循例開售棉紗外，代紗管會在棉紗市塲標售棉紗十二種，計售出五六八件，另代售棉布三十五種，被單三種，計售出棉布二〇，三八〇疋，被單六〇條。物價評議會食糖小組週一會議決議，廿一期台糖配價不變。</p>
<p>週二紡建公司續代紗管會在市塲標售棉紗十三種，計售出棉紗八二一件。</p>
<p>週三紡建公司續代拋售棉花四種，計共售出八，六〇〇市祖，棉紗十五種，計售出一，一八二件。民調會配出次白粳及秈米共二，三八〇石，白粳配價每石五四〇萬元，秈米配價五二〇萬元。</p>
<p>週四紡建公司代售棉花四種，計七，九九〇市祖，棉紗十三種，計八六九件。民調會拋售白粳及秈米共三，七六〇石，白粳配價提高爲每石五五〇萬元，秈米提高爲五三〇萬元。</p>
<p>週五紡建公司代售棉花三種，計五，五四五担，棉紗十一種，計九〇四件。</p>
<p>週六紡建公司繼代售棉花三種，計一，八〇〇担，棉紗十三種，計售出一，一七六件。民調會拋出各種食米共二，七四三石。</p>
<p>第二，當局爲抑平物價，除拋售物資外，復大量抽緊銀根。據稱自十四日起，即採有效措施，迄至最近，行局差進總額已在六萬億以上。惟華北西北及華中各地，匯款湧到，並迭有鉅額現鈔運來，以致抽緊功效，尙未能十分表現。</p>
<p>第三，加强管制。國行自前週抽緊銀根後，退票增多，前週末竟達一萬四千餘億之鉅，創空前紀錄。金管局隨即嚴加澈查，行莊方面，將公佈其行名，並予以嚴厲處分。客戶方面即移法院究辦，兼之總統副總統訂於廿日就職，投機者不無戒心。</p>
<p>第四，平衡會外匯基準價，自四月六日調整後，穩定月餘之久，於週一忽見調整，各種匯率平均上漲四成六。美匯自卅二萬四千元漲至四十七萬四千元，計漲十五萬元：英匯自九十七萬二千元，漲至一百四十二萬二千元，計漲四十五萬元；其他港匯印匯等，亦均比例提升。</p>
<p>按過去歷次調整外匯基準價格，市塲輒受其刺激，物價上漲，致引起軒然大波。此次調整，市場物價，雖略有波動，但影響遠不及過去之甚，這是因爲此次調整前的牌價，尙不及黑市匯價的三分之一，已早成脫節現象，故對一般物價，已少刺激作用。</p>
<p>此外上週有關物價措施之可得而述者有：</p>
<p>（一）國行增發短期國庫券兩種，一爲五月底到期，一爲六月半到期，據稱此舉係便利工商界融通資金，以便到期軋賬，至發行折扣，仍逐日掛牌決定。</p>
<p>（二）國家行局之一般業務貸款，其資金之來源，前經四聯總處規定爲自行吸收存款，其存款利率，近復經四聯核定由過去年息八　，提高爲年息四分，放款利率提高爲月息一角八分，此亦爲國行逐漸打破過去低利政策之一例。</p>
<p>（三）據聯合徵信所訊，中港新協定，中港政府正進行談判中，最近即將具體化，新政府成立後，可作最後決定。</p>
<p>據悉新協定內容、係以控制香港市塲爲原則，其實施步驟，將取締港市之自由買賣，對於富有投機性之商業及金融機構、由港政府禁止設立。果能實現，當可杜絕金鈔黑市之活動，對我安定金融，當有莫大裨益，此事係由中央銀行代表進行交涉，聞港政府已表示願意協助。</p>
<p>上週市塲物價走勢，在前述政府拋售物資與抽緊銀根兩大壓力下，頗有欲漲又止之狀，惜外埠游資　到，抽緊功效未能十分顯著。</p>
<p>華洋股市方面，始終在穩檔盤旋，起伏頗爲狹隘，　情於下節股市述之。</p>
<p>紗布方面，因當局抽　銀根，紗管會大量拋售，趨勢亦穩，四十二支藍鳳始終站定二億九千萬至三億之間。粗紗略升，如廿一支雙馬由週一之一億九千二百萬，漲至週末之二億三千萬。龍頭細布與組紗走勢略同，週末較週初約漲一成餘。</p>
<p>米糧方面，因天雨到貨稀少，產價報漲、民調會拋售數量，又不能滿足市塲需要，爲上週中漲價較猛之貨品。如北市塲上白粳，由週初之每石五四五萬漲至週四之五九〇萬、塲外喊價，曾破六百萬大關。及至週五，天氣轉晴，外埠到貨較多，價始由高峯稍趨回落。週末因無錫米價報漲，價再向高峯邁進，南北兩市塲均破六百萬大關。</p>
<p>雜糧麥油等，係穩中見俏。麵粉因北銷旺盛，市價步升，如兵船一號粉由週初之一七八萬，漲至週末之二一六萬。</p>
<p>日用品如肥皂火柴等，略見漲跌，走勢尙稱平穩。</p>
<p>餘如化學品金屬等，雖不無起　　　　備　　風，已登高位，故尙無新價出現。</p>

<p>工商動態</p>
<h3>為進出口貿易業憂！</h3>
<p>上週（十七日）外匯基準率雖又經當局掛高，但轍出業是否有改善之　，仍未可樂觀。</p>
<p>本月十五日，猪鬃輸出業因外匯牌價與成本相差過鉅，曾前往中央銀行及輸管曾請願，要求暫不結匯。十八日該業更趨中央路彼賽飯店，召開緊急會議，並決議即日推派代表向政府陳述困難，請求改變出口結匯辦法。</p>
<p>十八日，本市進出口公會亦召開出口組會員大會，結論認承欲求改善目前輸出情况，唯一辦法，祗右無條件開放外匯，並實施貿易述鎖制度。</p>
<p>但是據中央銀行及輸管會負責人表示，對扶助出口業，他們無時不在設法推動。並謂開放外匯，尙非其時，因牽制向題太多，如不謀根本解決，反足造成惡果，故政府方面，目前亦決未攷慮及此。</p>
<p>如此說來，當局目前除繼續採取「機動性外匯政策」而外，尙談不到所謂「開放外匯」。但是「機動性外匯市價」如與黑市價格相去過遠、勢必影響出口而减少政府的外匯收入，政府外匯頭寸的收入旣減少，於是只有在「不必要」的進口物資上打算，亦即减少政府認爲「不必要」物資的進口。最近央行與輸管會發出「第一三一號通函」，即爲减少普通物貨進口的證明，該「通函」規定進口商須將許可證之外匯數額百分之五十，按當日市價，折合國幣繳存央行，以迄進口貨運到時始作結價。</p>
<p>此項規定，就對進口業言當然是一大打擊，本市進出口公會上週週四接獲天津·靑島·廣州·福州·等埠進出口公會函電，略謂當局此種辦法，足以加重進口原料成本影響工業生產殊鉅，故一致表示反對。</p>
<p>不過在目前情况下，反對是一回事，反對是否能生效，又是一回事。本市某大報所載天津通訊一則說得好，「進口結匯新辦法公佈後，大家對政府失去信心，好像政府已經是自動宣佈外匯枯竭，法幣大貶値，所以多數資金轉求金鈔，藉以保全幣値」。於是繼紡織廠南遷之後，最近又有若干較大之進出口商行，紛紛在南遷中，其中以遷香港者最多，影響所及，不可謂不小。</p>
<p>如據輸管會方面消息：本月份半月來之出口結匯，尙不足上月份結匯之半數，進出口商行南遷均爲外匯關係，此事若不謀適當解決辦法，則又可形成資金大量南逃云云。</p>
<p>繼上期所論「民族工商業的危難」以後，我們不得不再爲中國的進出口貿易事業的前途，表示憂懼！</p>
<h3>貨幣金融</h3>
<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>上週本市銀根，雖尙承前週以來的緊勢，但終因北方游資，及內地資金的紛紛抵達而吿舒和，國家行局雖以拋售物資及稅款等收入，而經常表現一鉅額之着進，但由於行局每以同業存款或轉帳方式，向商業銀行調換票據，致市上銀根未見如前週之緊俏，行莊間接交換組之交換出數迭見减少，與此亦有關係。</p>
<p>一般說來，業內頭寸較業外鬆和，行莊同業拆放雖尙見盛做，但以供源旺盛，週轉並不阻滯，現鈔籌碼亦因各地運來者多而見鬆濫，迄晚自行莊解繳央行的現鈔，一週來在一萬五千億以上。</p>
<p>據金融界人士談稱，此次銀根緊潮，似已吿一段落。本週以後，可能呈現一鬆和的局面。</p>
<p>上週自週一至週五，行局共差進四萬四千六百四十二億，如扣除同期內商業銀行於央行的定存，共二萬五千一百億不計外，行局之實際差進亦達一萬九千五百四十二億之鉅，較前週同期內之差進數尙增二千餘億。</p>
<p>至於六十號以後行莊交換結果，五天內共差出三萬二千多億，與前週同期內之差出額相近，但每天的差出額，似有减少的趨勢。</p>
<p>洋商銀行自週一至週五共差進九千二百三十八億，較前週同期內减進約四千一百餘億。</p>
<p>上週暗息，大致做三角三分，做三角六分以上者不多見，而三角一分半者則頗多。暗息之走勢爲自高轉低，恰與前週自低轉昻之趨勢相反，於比亦可見銀根緊勢已稍殺。至於證券帮塲外貼息，以週三週四爲最高計多方貼出四十四元，（合息約五角），空方貼進四十元（合息爲四角半）。週五多空各降四元，回復週二之原盤。</p>
<p>（二）內外滙率</p>
<p>上週內滙行市，穗匯週一爲八十元，週二以後至週五降爲五十元，厦門匯水至週二亦已降至五十元，但週三後即續升，至週五已升至一百八十元。</p>
<p>渝匯五天內始終爲平匯，漢匯週一爲六十元，週三已降至二十元，週四五回升至五十元，津匯貼水週一爲七十元，淍五已增至一百四十元。</p>
<p>大致上週滙率以週中爲轉捩點，週初匯率趨降，說明各地資金流入本市者多，週中以後，因本市銀根已漸見轉和，資金倒流者减少，但是津匯貼水迭見增見，足以證明，北方游資南流依舊汹湧，這可能係受戰事的影響。</p>
<p>上週外匯基準率在較長時間穩定後，又見掛高，美匯提高爲四十七萬四千，計增加百分之四十六，英美套匯率未變，英匯每鎊合國幣一百四十二萬二千元。</p>
<p>香港申匯行情，因當局恐刺激人心，在報上只能看到隔日的市面，週一法幣十萬合港幣四角一分，週二三申縮互見，週四爲四角六分，香港美元市價週一爲五元二角三分，後續漲，至週四爲五元三角八分。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>週初，銀根緊俏，初開低度，永紗僅二五七〇元，旋聞外匯掛高四成許，遽升至二七一五元，他股均見穩狀，終日起伏狹隘。</p>
<p>翌日，內地現鈔，續有運到，銀根轉鬆，外象轉悄，各股均趨堅穩，永紗達二七二〇元。信和爲九六〇元，新光以三九·五收市，景福爲二〇·五元。</p>
<p>週三銀根已趨鬆弛，外象皆悄，各股盤旋上挺，永紗迫近三千元關。景福·新光·各升三角，八角。統益·信和·亦漲三四十元。</p>
<p>週四國家行局收繳紗糖等款，差進達萬五千億，銀根突緊，永紗迂迴曲降，收盤勉站二千八百元，各股均吿下挫。</p>
<p>週五北地資金，南來汹湧，銀根緊勢，已近尾聲，人心平定，各股均趨挺悄，永紗臨收越二千九百關，信和叩一千元大關，新光爲三九·五元，景福爲二〇·二〇元。週末繼此種趨勢後，大多緩步上升。</p>
<p>外股於週一登塲，因外匯掛高，人心不免看好，怡紗開後爲四七二萬元，後以銀根緊壓，賣意濃郁，終見下挫，收市落至四四五萬元，英聯爲五〇五萬元，會德豐爲九八〇萬元。</p>
<p>週二走勢平定，因港匯無大起落，且銀根尙朱如何鬆濫，市勢遂不脫盤局，怡紗英聯等上落甚微。</p>
<p>週三外股市况，因港匯又有波動，黑市再吿堅挺，銀根已趨鬆弛，人心向榮，遂吿上漲，怡紗激升至五一七萬元，英聯爲五七五萬元，會德豐叩一二〇〇萬元關，一致昂挺。</p>
<p>週四因傳港匯見伸，銀根再緊，於是多有吐售，盤旋下降，怡紗回見四九八萬元，英聯爲五五〇萬元，會德豐爲一〇二〇萬元。</p>
<p>週五港匯報縮，黑市金融性物品再吿堅昇，各股一致挺進，怡紗升至五一六萬元，英聯爲五六〇萬元，會德豐爲一一〇〇萬元。</p>
<p>週末因銀根見鬆，各股再升，尤以怡紗漲起半成强爲最俏，計爲五四一萬元。</p>
<h3>財政部通盤研究　改善僑滙辦法　逐月減低說完全不確</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕財部對於吸收華僑匯款，向極重視，目前僑匯收入，因外匯市價與黑市匯價相差較多，不免受有影響，爲補救計，自以將匯價追隨黑市最爲有效；惟如此則黑市匯價繼漲增高，勢將劇烈刺激物價，影響全民生活，故未敢貿然會諸實施。財部現對華僑確款，在手續上可予僑胞及僑眷便利之處，莫不努力以赴，督飭各承辦行局，盡量改善，如在僑胞較多地區，增加辦理僑匯機構，簡化匯款及領款手續，並於國內閩，粵等地預儲解付僑匯頭寸，及按址分送匯款等，均尙辦有成效；至如何增加僑匯收入，維護僑胞利益，增加國家外匯來源，並兼顧國內物價及經濟安定之原則下改善僑匯辦法，財部正在通盤研究中。至本年三，四兩月份華僑匯款，正確統計數字，因各承辦行局報表仍未送齊，尙未結出，報載僑匯收入現已逐月减低一節完全不確。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫</p>

<h3>戰後之蘇聯化學工業</h3>
<p>— 謝天鑣</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>蘇聯自一九四六年至一九五〇年為第四次五年計劃之實施時期，刻正進入第三個年頭，規定在這次五年計劃完成後，一般工業水準，能比戰前提高百分之五十，化學工業，當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>第四次五年計劃，關于化學工業方面，其努力標的，主要有二：（一）增產一般化學成品，配合其他工業之進展，（二）達到軍需自給，國防安全。</p>
<p>自一九四六年後，蘇聯政府除積極修復並擴充受戰刦之舊有化學工廠之外，並新創許多基本化學工廠，如酸，碱，肥料等工廠，希望此等新工廠完成後，再漸漸擴及民生消耗品之製造及自給，同時蘇聯並不因政治上之歧見，仍然自美輸入機器，原料，及民生消耗品，正由于各該項之成品，爲蘇聯國內所缺乏，且在戰爭復員後人力，燃料，電力，建築材料等之畸形缺乏，使第四次五年訂劃進行應覺困難，爲力求克復困難起見，蘇聯政府利用中歐占領區之工業先天優裕，來補養其本國後天營養之不足。</p>
<p>在戰時，蘇聯政府曾全力推進合成氨，硫酸，硝酸，磷肥，磷酸銨硝酸銨，硝酸鈉，碳化鈣，　化鈣，油漆，化肥。塑膠等各項化學品之增產，戰後除了上述基本化學品繼續增產外，對人造汽油，橡皮，塑膠，酒請，煤焦副產法煉油，以及天然氣之生產等，也正計劃增產，此外尙有安尼林染料及醫療藥品，亦予大量製造。</p>
<p>化學肥料</p>
<p>此次五年計劃中，增產化肥爲主要目標之一，預計在一九五〇年化肥中磷肥增產，應爲戰前產量之一倍，氮肥應爲〇·八倍，鉀肥應爲〇·三倍，總其三種化肥，在一九五〇年，其計劃總產量應爲五百四十萬噸，其中磷肥占四十萬噸，在此次五年計劃中製造化肥之投資，占全部化工事業投資之半數，其重要性可想而知。</p>
<p>聯聯在此次大戰中，其本國工業，受戰爭之損失，至爲浩大，據佔計，製造淡製品機器，幾損失百分之五十，硫酸設備，損失百分之七十七，純碱，百分之八十三，顏料，百分之八十八，然蘇聯政府在戰時，確已盡可能將近西之化工設備，移往烏拉爾及莫斯科區，以便成品近於市塲，當時所以如此者，蓋以爲利用製成後之化肥施用於該區號稱農業區之領域，使農產品如棉花，菸草，蕃薯，橡樹，等能够增產，經施用化肥之結果，一九四六年之農產品，已較一九四五年增產至百分之五十二，一九四七年之農產品之產量，自可希望更較上年爲佳。</p>
<p>人造汽油及合成橡皮</p>
<p>此次五年計劃，擬增產人造汽油，產量每年達九十萬噸之紀錄，其理由雖然蘇聯爲世界第二產油國，由於戰爭關係，麥哥巴及格老茲之汕田頻遭破壞外，其號稱供應全國百分七十之大油田—巴庫油田亦早自動炸壞，伏爾加及烏拉爾區油田之生產，並未能　合理想，故增　人造汽油，仍屬必要。</p>
<p>鑒於總境占領區內，有現成設備，人材，原料及烟煤等，及本國煤之匱乏，與合成性機械之笨車搬遷不易，遂改就原地復工生產，此外修復戰時受嚴重損壞之杜尼茲煤鐵產區，（杜尼茲盆地不但爲蘇聯產煤唯一中心，且尙有約占全國百分五十至六十鐵礦，約占全國百分二十生鐵及鋁，百分二十五之電力等資源，故該區之修復與整個條聯之化工復興有深切關係）</p>
<p>蘇聯合成橡皮之計劃增產數量，將爲上次計劃之一倍，亦郎爲全世界人造橡膠之總產量百分之卅八，蘇聯合成橡膠生產，自一九二八年開始，其時因戰時需要激增，除由蕃製成酒精，作爲人造橡膠之原料，積極擴充生產外，並在天然橡樹內榨取原料。</p>
<p>在一九三一年，蘇聯政府已建立人造橡膠廠四所，二次五年計劃完成後，另又增建四所，在第三次五年計劃實施期間，正當戰事爆發其時已有十八所人造橡膠廠在已成及創建中。一九三八年估計，每年以金屬鈉疊化丁二烯以製造人造橡膠達十萬噸以上，此法係根據雷白達夫改進法，先由酒精製得丁二烯，在一九三九年估計，製造一噸丁二烯需二·八噸酒精，較一九二八年以酒精製造丁二烯所需數量，已節省一倍矣！</p>
<p>鑒於由糧食蕃　製造酒精，影響食糧，蘇聯現已改用乙炔天然氣及石油等作原料，此後蘇聯人民每人橡膠消耗量僅及〇·三七磅，較同時美國每人消耗量爲九·九磅，相差懸殊，可知蘇聯今後對像膠增產，較之美國，仍待努力！</p>
<p>人造纎維</p>
<p>大戰前蘇聯之迭次五年計劃中，均注重於天然纖維之生產，至人造纖維工業，係戰後新興者，預計一九五〇年計劃產量，將爲戰前繊維工業四至五倍，以蘇聯境內擁有六億英畝之樹林，足供人造纖維製造原料而無慮，此外用樹皮及枝幹，又可爲酒精·丙酮·硫酸衍生物·松香·松節油等原料。</p>
<p>天然氣</p>
<p>蘇聯境內，較著名之天然氣儲藏有二百處之多，由於戰時燃料之急需，加速開採，於一九四四年，自布加爾斯蘭至喀帕息夫廠地長達一〇五哩之兩行天然氣管，埋置完成，最近完成自薩拉吐夫氣田至莫斯科之氣管亦長達五三〇哩，其他正在設計中有自烏克蘭西部達哈佛至基輔有三〇〇哩距離之氣管，尙有愛斯多尼亞至列寗格勒有一三六哩氣管，亟待埋置，如能完成，亦不失爲一浩大建設。</p>
<p>蘇聯天然氣，多由炭化煤田中之煤得到，以此項方法，製得天然氣，可省去煤之運費及灰份之累　，其法係熱空氣混入氧氣，壓入地道，而得天然氣。</p>
<p>塑膠及油脂</p>
<p>蘇聯之塑膠工業，在戰時特別注意，一九四七年，僅就烏克蘭一地，已有十八座塑膠工廠，一九五〇年，染料及塑膠之生產，比戰前可增加百分之三十，產量達四萬三千噸。</p>
<p>蘇聯對油脂工業，向甚重視，芝蔴與向日葵的種植和生產，常有各地農業試臉塲改進的提示和報吿，甚有顯著進步，大部分自向日葵煉成之油脂，加以硬化後，以製人造奶油及肥皂，一九五〇年，可達年產肥皂八十七萬噸紀錄，較之一九四〇年，肥皂之年產量，僅得八〇萬噸，當有進步。（未完）</p>
<h3>點金有術</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>在美國橡嶺（田納西州）的聯邦原子能研究所，最近已完成了古煉金術家的夢想—製成了人造金，原子墩堆（Atomic　pile）作爲點金石（Philosopher's　Stone）經過一連串的反應，產生了二十四克拉的純金（按：克拉非表示重金而係純度）。</p>
<p>但是，人造金最奇怪的特質是無論保存得怎樣安妥，隔不了一星期，它們又蛻變而成其他元素，唯其如此，「放射性金」却更增高了它的價値，因爲它在醫學上有極大的貢獻，六十一個病人已經幸運地得到了它的治愈。</p>
<p>不過，製人造金却並不是一個致富捷徑，因爲原料是更貴重的鉑（Platinum），然而它的意義是廣大的，顯示了科學的萬能外，也建立了同位元素（Isotopes）的重要地位。</p>
<p>雖然，到今日的週期表中還祗有九十六個元素，但是，同位元素的發現，已經超過七百種以上，同樣的元素有相同的化學性質，却帶着不同的物理性質，它的發展促成了原子彈的發明，也帮助了人造金的成功。我們能够很安全地處理鈾二三八，可是鈾二三五却能發生爆炸，於此可見有些同位元素是安定的，相反的，有些却在轉瞬間發生了變化，即使是我們最熟悉的鐵或硫。</p>
<p>如是把七八五個同位元素徘列成表，看起來一定很複雜，但是仔細研究一下，我們可以看出這千變萬化的元素，實在只繫於兩個因素：一個是一八八六年所發現帶正電荷的質子（或稱陽電子Proton）；還有一個就是完全電中性的中子（Neutron），在一九三二年才完全發現它的特性，整個的宇宙乃是這兩個「粒子」所構成的。</p>
<p>於是，人造同位元素也獲得了成功，因爲質子的數字影響元素在週期表中的地位，和它的性質（化學性及物理性），譬如氫是一個質子，氦（Helium）有兩個質子，這樣順次一直到最近發現的元素96—鋸（Curium）爲止。不但如此，質子和中子的總和數就決定了同位元素的種類。</p>
<p>爲了證明這個原理，我們可以作一個簡單的表演：假使你袋裏藏了一個銀幣，在廻旋通（Cyolotron）旁工作，不久以後，銀幣中會發現少量的鍢（Cadmium），這是造幣廠中並沒有加入籃幣的金屬。事實是這樣的，硬幣中的銀是Ag107—包括四十七個質子，六十個中子；接受了廻旋通所放出的一個中子，就變成　位元素Ag108，這是一種放射性元素，它會放出一個電子（Beta射綫），使元素中的一個中子變成質子，於是，比Ag107多一個質子的　一〇八就產生了。</p>
<p>科學的進展祗是在於能够控制放射性的速度，並不讓它用幾萬年的時間來自生自减，雖然放射性依舊，但是原子衝擊器　儀器縮短，實驗的時間，使占科學家們認爲不可能研究的事實，終告實現。</p>
<p>應用了這些原理，新元素體現了，人造金也成功了。問題只在今日的科家們，怎樣利用已有的成就去作一些實際的實獻呢？</p>
<h3>睡眠中也能學習</h3>
<p>— 同高</p>
<p>學習有些東西是痛苦的，像語言，乘法表，電報字碼等等。現在這痛苦有希望可以解除了。有一種機器能够在你睡着時敎你。這是美國靈加風學院院長歇羅佛氏（Max　Sherover）發明的。</p>
<p>這架機器並不荒誕不經。事實上，在北卡羅林那大學試騐了兩年以後，那裏的心理學家宣稱，這種睡眠中學習的計劃是成功的。</p>
<p>歇羅佛氏的機器其實是留聲機，電唱頭，和枕底話筒的一個組合。心理學家意利沃脫（Charles　R．Elliott）曾選了十五個互相無關的字眼，把它們的聲音用　盤錄了下來。</p>
<p>那十五個字眼是：男孩，鷄蛋，說話，奔走，藝術，並不，先生，脚，袋，划船，冰，出去，年紀，盒子，吃。意利沃脫敎授選了四十個聽覺健全的學生，開始他的睡眠敎授了。</p>
<p>在每一次試騐中，讓二十個學生好好睡着不受干擾，另外二十個學生則在睡着以後枕頭底下放一只話筒，話筒再接迎到電唱頭，每隔相當時間聽一遍上面那些字眼，一共反覆三十次。敎授用了腦電儀（Electroencephatograph）可以證明他們的確都是睡着的。腦電儀是記錄腦電波的儀器，睡着的腦電波和醒時的腦電波原是有分別的。</p>
<p>經過了三小時的酣睡以後，把四十個學生都呌醒，拿這些字眼的名單給他們讀一會兒。然後，呌他們儘可能地默出那十五個字眼來。結果，那二十個受過歇羅佛氏睡眠敎授的很快就默出來了。至於那二十個睡了不曾受擾的呢，却顯出了很劣的成績。</p>
<h3>太平洋的島嶼</h3>
<p>— 君湄</p>
<p>太平洋的島嶼至多，分佈極廣，面積小的，在地圖上僅僅看見一點，繫以名稱；而大部分的，多爲朱名島，僅有少數居民。即以菲律濱而論，島嶼的數月在七千個以上。其他像這的也正不少。所以有人說太平洋有「無數」的島嶼，實非過言。這些島嶼大都是彈丸之地，渺小難尋；然而大如陸洲的，亦復不少，例如新幾內亞（New　Guinea）爲僅次於格林蘭（Greenland）的世界第二大島，面積三三〇，〇〇〇平方哩，約當我國台灣的二十五倍，海南島二十三倍。</p>
<p>太平洋的島嶼數目，究有若干，是很難以佔計的，因爲往往一處環礁（Atoll）實爲十餘個小島所合成。近據專家調查，太平洋的島嶼，主要的有二千六百五十個，次要的小島不計其數。例如都阿摩多羣島（Tuamotu　Group）就是此等小島的一個例，當地土語的意義是「島雲」（ACloud　of　Istands），極言其多，島之較大的，約有八十個，小的難以僕數，各島面積的總和，不過三三〇平方哩。太平洋島羣的分類，至今未有相當的好辦法，無論採用什麼原則，像政治區分，氣候差異，動植物的分佈，或地質構造，都有顧此失彼的弊病。現在一般的分組，很是勉强，合理的分類，應根據地質歷史及動物生活，這樣的研究，也是很有趣的。</p>
<p>不過最通行的分組辦法，是根據有史以來的土著種族的分佈。凡是位於菲律濱以東，新幾內亞以北，這中間的許多島嶼，是由短而且黑的民族所居住的，統名密克羅尼西亞（Micrones）。由黑種居處的各島爲墨染尼西亞（Melanesia），包括新幾內亞，東至斐濟羣島（Fiji　Islands）。在中太平洋，島嶼最多，分佈也最廣，呌做波里尼西亞（Polynesia），居民膚色黃褐，形貌都麗，爲著名的航海家，他們所分佈的地械，南起新西蘭（New　Zealand），北至夏威夷（Hawaii　Islands），東至伊斯德島（Easter　Island），範圍最廣。</p>
<p>此外，在西太平洋方面，沿亞洲大陸，也有不少的島嶼，包括我國的海南島，台灣島琉球羣島，迤北至日本羣島，庫頁島，以及千島羣島。在東北太平洋中，最重要的島嶼是阿留申羣島（Aleutian　Islands），聯接阿拉斯加半島。此外遠離在東太平洋中，騎跨赤道南北的，復有喀拉巴戈斯舉島（Galapagos　Group），距厄瓜多國（Eucador，一名赤道國）約五百哩。</p>
<p>在西南太平洋中，還有幾個大島，那就是在菲律賓南部的婆羅洲（Borneo）和更南的爪哇（Java）及蘇門答臘（Sumatra與荷屬印尼所屬的許多島嶼。這些島嶼，在太平洋的開發史上，都有過輝煌的記載。</p>
<p>最後，所謂大洋洲（Oceania）是指洋面區域和西南太平洋的各島嶼而言，包括世界最大島或世界最小的洲，澳洲在內。</p>
<p>茲爲淸晰起見，把上述各個領城內的較大的島名和的而積列舉出來，欲知其詳，須參閣專書。</p>

<h3>吮癰篇</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>法家的學說雖然殘刻寡恩，但多少有些合乎事實。中國人把一針見血之談，就呌做殘酷，因爲太不留情了。備內篇云：</p>
<p>「醫善吮人之傷，含人之血，非骨肉之親也，利所加也；故輿人成興，則欲人之貴富，匠人成棺，則欲人之夭死也。非輿人仁而吒人賊也，人不貴，則輿不售，人不死，則棺不買：情非憎人也，利在人之死也。」</p>
<p>豈不是鞭辟入裏的話？流子也說過：「矢人豈不仁於函人哉，矢人唯恐不傷人，函人唯恐傷人，故術不可不愼也。」意思相近，而把責任歸在擇術上，其實這話是講不通的，天下人都來擇函人與作與，莫非人死了就沒人管嗎？推此以論，藥店，醫生，甚至衛生設備全是不可要的了。所以還是韓子的話比較合理。</p>
<p>若然，則與克魯泡特金的互助諭大相衝突。克氏以爲社會的進步與存在，在於人類的互助；並無功利之觀存乎其中；然而我們細加思考，則又知互助之目的，即是互利，亦即墨氏之所謂兼愛。蟻與蚜虫，一盡保護之責，一盡供給別人吮蜜之責，豈不然乎？所以互利亦不可厚非，若想人人委身餵餓虎，完菩薩宏願，那是救世者與聖賢的最高理想，求之於凡人，徒見其不行而已。</p>
<p>在人人互利而得到均衡的社會，就是天下太平，我想太平之平字，不妨望文生義的作這樣解。物不得其平則鳴，古來已然，於今爲甚，故西洋的政治哲學是Give　and　Take，最忌殺鷄取蛋，此乃人人易知之事，無奈知而不行，遂使天下永遠在擾攘中，人類爲愚爲智，殆有不易曉者</p>
<p>我想這原因總不出過於爲自己打算，而又忘了替別人打算即是替自己。儒者傳統是尊君與維持社會原有秩序，這也是一種自私，因爲這樣本身才有生活的安定和飛黃騰遠。維持整個社會秩序固未嘗不好，　耐其末流只記住自己之飛黃騰達，而忘了社會。而且士紳本是中國主權的眞正所有人，現實的地位更會使他們短視，以爲一當今之世，舍我其誰」！於是享受與剝奪認作當然，施惠於人民乃是犧牲悲憫。我們看明代晚年的里居紳耆，無一不是聊齋志異裏所說的「虎而冠」者，董其昌是讀書明理之人，又作到內閣大學士，居然搶男覇女，激起人民反抗，至於毀屋焚舍，其犯衆怒亦可知矣。筆記中記載淸代的桐城派大家方苞也有點這樣，看起來文章是一事，行爲又是一事，殆不能不使人深致嘅嘆也。</p>
<p>本來孔子也是以得君爲職志的，其意在實現自己的理想，所以才不惜到各國去碰壁。不料其後却是「正其衣冠齊其顏色」的賤儒，其發展定是「全軀保妻子」。若再進一步，便是驢鳴狗吠之徒。爲目的不擇手段，已竟成爲讀書人的傳統，試一統計各朝代的執政者，非與外戚結合，即與宦官勾結，遠如東漢黨錮之禍，士君子之淸流，最後依附的賽憲，還不是外戚？近人陳寅恪氏考證，唐代之朋黨之爭，即是宦者派別之爭，賢如李文饒，亦不免此；若淸代的李鴻章袁世凱，和明代的鬧然，殆尤不必論矣；有時在戚宦之外，竟會勾結到敵人外族，或則五朝元老，恬不知恥，那一個不是儒老者流的成績，由此觀之，　大夫之無恥，是謂國恥，蓋無時無地不然矣。</p>
<p>禮失求之野，其實中國農民並不壞，即使壞，也是士大夫和紳十逼迫而成的，俗語所謂官逼民反，還是由形迹求之。官紳者人民之表率，也就是大多數人的生活目的，上有好者，下必有甚焉者矣，在風氣上久已樹立了不良的楷模，又何能責罵鄉人之攘鷄罵狗，奸淫邪盜乎？近聞有人云，中國不要辦民衆敎育，幹壞事的全是識字人，話雖過激，理有由來！若是讀書人再不改變吮　舐痔的作風，或者民衆敎育再辦數十年，終將不免於民族的淪落，亦不可知耳。</p>
<h3>下酒三菜</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>油爆蝦是吃酒的好菜，一年四季都有，但此物亦有其時令。夏初—約在五月光景—吃爆蝦，其頭部有一點紅，約如一粒紅豆大，透出殼外，此即蝦臘，最為鮮美，有珠櫻之美名，現正當令，老　不可不知。</p>
<p>春日桃花開時，有一種烏飛來，不數日即去，亦候烏之一也。長喙，彩羽，短尾，名爲桃花鷄，又名爲麥啄。其頭圾佳，以重油煎酥，加糖醋烹之，過酒極美。或以十鳥配好腿肉半斤，用老酒醬油香料透煮，悶置　中，則數日飲酒不他求矣。</p>
<p>蟹爲最鮮之物，我以爲醉蟹吃　最佳。其製法以花椒鹽置人團臍躋中，用最好老酒及醋，略加糖粞，將蟹扎緊，置罎中，藏在陰暗處，不久即可開食，每次取食，不可用燈火，用燈火，蟹即發沙，歷試不爽。製醉蟹有一歌訣，茲錄於後：</p>
<p>廿個團臍不用尖，半斤好醋半斤鹽，四兩糖　斤半酒，吃到明年二月天。</p>
<p>凡食物中鮮美者，皆有其時令，如　魚，黃鮮在夏初，刀魚在春初，鷄鴨爲終年皆有之物，而鷄以春時爲佳，鴨以秋時爲佳，所謂春鷄八鴨（舊曆之八月）是也。</p>
<h3>詩人楊雲史</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>詩人楊雲史以名公子參與吳佩孚將軍戎幕，爲秘書長，遂名聞全國。自稱江東楊圻，雲史其字也，別署野王，榜名朝慶，常熟人，淸光緒壬寅南元，官郵傳部郞中，新加坡總領事。其父乃左都御史楊崇伊也。</p>
<p>雲史初娶李鴻章女孫，繼娶徐氏，所謂霞客夫人者。徐旋又歿，雲史時將隨　將軍出師，殮徐之翌日，即棄家從行，因有「可憐九月十三夜，死別生離第一宵」之句，傳誦一時。晚年眷狄美南，紅袖添香，頗不寂寞。所著江山萬里樓詩鈔，歌行多長慶體，五律必效杜少陵，天才橫溢，下筆不能自休。丁丑之變，避地香港，悲歌慷慨，人稱詩史。曾奉召入蜀，以謠傳吳將軍且出山，雲史力白吳將軍決不認賊作父。迨吳將軍被迫殉國，雲史賦詩哭之，字字血淚，後亦歿於香港。雲史事吳將軍至誠恪，余嘗於茶座見雲史與人談及吳，輒稱「主公」而不名，且其態度誠肅，如稱君父。吳對彼靑眼相看，兩人平生歡若魚水也。</p>
<p>雲史嘗酒後大雪中登遼東城，賦詩十二首，語重心長，悲壯淋淌，猶其餘事。玆摘錄其四首云：「盤馬彎弓苜蓿肥，金湯大好啓戎機；雪花如棠陰山白，不照金樽照鐵衣。」「逐鹿中原舉國空，邊軍力盡更張弓。黃命白骨知多少？都在營州落照中。」一九合諸侯事惘然，三分猶得靖烽烟；江流不限南風競，門外津橋啼杜鵑。　層　美酒飲千鍾，日落淸歌欲盪胸，醉裏未忘關塞氣，玉人扶定看盧龍。」末首英雄兒女，兩俱有之，猶龔定盦詩所謂「爲恐劉郞英氣　，捲簾梳洗對黃河」也</p>
<p>雲史里居日，初寓虛　園，繼居九萬圩，堂前遍植梅花，中無雜樹·歲朝，堂中每懸慈禧后所書大幅福字，供香案，盛陳設，入民國後猶然，則不免有遺老習氣。然其人情感特重，洵爲詩人本色。其子千頃，儒雅風流，亦有聲藝林。是則雲史眞乃名父之子，名子之父矣。</p>
<h3>三月不知肉味</h3>
<p>— 虞山</p>
<p>「孔子聞韶，三月不知肉味。」孔子聽了著名的音樂，竟會三個月忘掉豬肉的味道，眞太奇特了！我以爲不應該這樣解釋的。世說新語上說：「絲不如竹，竹不如肉。」爲什麼道理呢？他的答案是：「蓋漸近自然耳。」照道理，琴瑟不及簫管，簫管不及口唱；因爲口唱最自然。所以梅蘭芳唱的戲頂好。韶樂是絲竹，論理不及口唱的佳妙，然而出乎例外，竟勝過一切口唱的歌曲，所謂「肉音」。孔夫子聽了牠，竟不願意再聽人們口唱的歌曲。所謂三月也者，言其久也。論語上所說顏回三月不違仁，即是一例。古人所稱三年三月等等，大都作多數或長時期解釋。可見孔千聽了韶樂之後，竟好久不願再聽口唱的歌曲。說他從此忘掉割得方方正正的冷豬肉，恐怕不見得吧？否則肉店老　且同音樂師勢不兩立，而「過屠門而大嚼」也頗可不必，只要去聽聽音樂可耳。</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>會心的苦笑常常此會心的微笑更多一分會心。</p>
<p>假使燈盞裏還有油，那熄了的火仍然會再亮起來。</p>
<p>世界上只有一個人和你永久不離：你自己的影子。</p>
<p>無軌電車雖然沒有軌道，但仍有它的路綫。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>吾又聞之，首都市當局宴請諸位女代表時，即席致新穎之演詞曰：「世界大局被男子弄得如此惡劣，必須換個局面，由女子代男而興，乃可望於改進。」又聞某院長設宴，亦作同情之共鳴，譴責男性，推重女性。此在交際塲上，雖似一種周旋動聽之詞令，而實含相當充足之理解。全球各國，國家大事，向來都是男子當先。即以女權開放之歐美而言，雖比亞洲舊時奴式女子較爲自由，女性從事社會，不限於家庭廚下，而政治之參與，仍居賓位，軍事及外交，更像是男性之特權。大體說來，男性之包辦「國事」，龔斷「大權」，確是萬方同慨，自古已然。包辦的結果，遠者瑣碎者且不暇列舉，只就近三十年之兩次世界大戰，尸山血海，彈雨硝烟，毀滅人類，毀滅宇宙，正所謂「馨南山之竹，書罪無窮；揚東海之彼，流惡未盡。」一部人類的罪惡史，直可斷言爲男性所造成，而Womankind不與其事，不負其責，而大受其累。故不論「以女代男」之能否實現，更不須預計女性代男後之成績如何，而男性之應當退位讓權，則絕無疑義。（編者按：英國故名作家貝洛克Hilaire　Belloc亦曾主張由太太們組織內閣，治理國家。）</p>

<h3>Designated Candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan: One Who Made Significant Contributions to Economic Development During the War of Resistance; The President Will Seek Approval from the Legislative Yuan Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Regarding the candidate for the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, because He Yingqin presented himself to the President in the afternoon of the 23rd and expressed his firm resolve not to assume the position, President Chiang has agreed to consider proposing another person. On the evening of the 23rd, the President hosted a dinner at his official residence for Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, and others, where discussions took place. It is rumored that a candidate has already been internally determined and will likely be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval by noon on the 24th. When reporters inquired of those who attended the meeting as to who would be nominated, all avoided answering directly, only stating that this person would be highly regarded in academic circles and would have made practical contributions to economic development. As for Zhang Qun's firm refusal, according to what our reporters have learned, Chen Bulei was ordered to persuade Zhang five times from May 4th to 18th. Although Zhang once agreed to consider it, he soon expressed that he could not take on the responsibility. On the afternoon of the 18th, he submitted a lengthy letter to the President, firmly declining the offer. On the 19th, Zhang met with the President at the National Government and reiterated his earnest refusal. The main reason for his consistent refusal was that at the beginning of constitutional governance, there were countless matters to be reformed, and it was necessary to refresh personnel and give people a new look to meet the expectations of the nation. On the 21st, he flew to Chongqing to visit his elderly mother. Political circles in Nanjing are saying that Zhang will return to Nanjing to handle the handover after a new candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan is selected.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20-something Dispatch] The Kuomintang has scheduled an extraordinary meeting of the Central Standing Committee for the morning of the 24th to discuss and decide on the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The third meeting of the first session of the first Legislative Yuan is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 24th. It is reported that the new candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan may be nominated on the morning of the 24th, and a plenary committee meeting will be held in the afternoon to discuss whether or not to approve the nomination.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The position of new Premier of the Executive Yuan will likely be filled by a third person other than Zhang Qun and He Yingqin. After He Yingqin held a press conference at 10:30 PM on the 23rd to announce his reasons for not being able to assume the position, this matter has been confirmed. However, who this third person is, is currently being considered by President Chiang. No nomination was made on the evening of the 23rd. Our reporter interviewed a certain authoritative person on the night of the 23rd, who said: The candidate for the new Premier of the Executive Yuan must be in line with government policies. Currently, the government has two major policies that must be implemented immediately, without time for leisurely consideration. One is the rapid advancement of the suppression of the rebellion, with the aim of completing it in the shortest possible time. The other is the use of American aid to stabilize the economy and tighten issuance, with American aid arriving imminently, making its use extremely urgent. Therefore, if the new Premier of the Executive Yuan is a third person other than Zhang and He, this person must be experienced, so that he can immediately implement administrative affairs smoothly in accordance with established policies.</p>
<p>He Yingqin's Public Statement: Announces Declination of Premiership</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] He Yingqin formally announced at 10:30 PM on the 23rd that he had declined the appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan and stated that this matter had been understood by the President. He Yingqin was summoned to the official residence to meet with the President at 8:30 PM and left at 9:30 PM. He then held a press conference at his residence at 10:30 PM, where he issued a written statement saying: "Regarding the first Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution, the President preferred Mr. Zhang Yuejun and myself. I am also deeply grateful for the recommendations of the majority of Kuomintang legislators. However, I have been engaged in military work for nearly 30 years and have not been able to devote much study to politics. Since being assigned to the United Nations Military Staff Committee in the United States, I have been away from the country for nearly two years and am not very familiar with the domestic political situation. At the beginning of constitutional governance, all administrative matters are awaiting reform, and I am completely unprepared for this, especially lacking experience in economic measures. I truly dare not shoulder this important task, lest I fail the expectations of my comrades and the people of the country. I have presented this situation to the President, requesting him to select someone more capable, and I have been understood by the President."</p>
<p>He has been urged by various parties to assume the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan in recent days, but after careful consideration, his will has remained unwavering. On the morning of the 23rd, He took a short trip to Qingliang Mountain. At 11:00 AM and 3:30 PM, Gu Zhutong was sent twice by the President to persuade He to assume the position. At 10:00 PM, the President summoned He again, with Wang Chonghui, Chen Bulei, Sun Ke, and others present. He immediately presented his difficulties and declined the new appointment. After about an hour of discussion, the President granted his request.</p>
<p>During his press conference at 10:30 PM, He briefly explained the situation of the meetings in recent days. Although he declined the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, he did not express a refusal to take on other important positions. A reporter asked He whether he could still take on other positions besides Premier of the Executive Yuan, so as to make contributions to the country. He replied: "This depends on the nature of the position and whether it is one that I am capable of." Someone asked He whether he had recommended anyone else when he declined the position. He replied: "I have no one to recommend." As for the emergence of a new candidate for Premier, He believes that it can be realized within a day or two.</p>

Committee members will be appointed from among the legislators, and each legislator can serve on up to three committees. Now that the Legislative Yuan has been meeting for a long time, the committees urgently need to be established as soon as possible, so that relevant committees can review formal proposals before they are discussed. The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has recently sent letters to each legislator, requesting them to inform the Secretariat by the 25th of the committees they wish to join, so that the information can be compiled and presented to the plenary session for a report, after which the committees will be established separately.</p>
<h3>Date of Convening of the Control Yuan: Will Be Postponed Until After June 10th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The date of convening of the Control Yuan under the Constitution will be extended due to the fact that the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan has not yet been decided, possibly to after June 10th. This is because the first Control Yuan must be convened by order of the President, and the President's order must be countersigned by the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Preparations for the meeting of the Control Yuan have been largely completed. The day after the convening order is issued, the registration procedures for the Control Committee members can be handled. As for the meeting location, the Preparatory Committee received a notice from the Presidential Palace on the 23rd, approving the temporary loan of the Lishi Society Auditorium for use. After the new Control Committee members register, the Preparatory Committee has decided to provide accommodation, transportation, and other expenses at a rate of 1.9 million yuan per day, with reference to the Legislative Committee's hospitality arrangements.

<h3>Zhu Shaozhou Broadcasts Speech: Points Out Gains and Losses of Military and Political Affairs in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Local Government Has Not Done Everything Possible to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Sian, 23rd Dispatch] In a broadcast speech entitled "Constitutional Governance and Suppression of Rebellion," Shaanxi Provincial Chairman Zhu Shaozhou again commented on the province's military and political affairs, saying: "The victory in the bandit suppression war in this province, I frankly tell all my fellow provincials today, is purely a military victory. If we examine it from other aspects, it is simply a huge failure! For example, when bandits infiltrated various counties, although some local governments were able to resist with all their might, many were negligent in prevention beforehand and did not make every effort to fight the bandits to the death when the time came. In short, the local governments and the people have not been able to exert their full strength, otherwise the results of the battle would have been even more brilliant." He also said: "The first major event when the bandits arrived in various counties was to open opium dens everywhere, sell drugs, and encourage the people to smoke opium. This is ironclad evidence of the Communist Party harming the people."</p>
<p>[United Press, Sian, 22nd Dispatch] Chairman Zhu Shaozhou told United Press reporters that the Communist bandits will attack Sian again in two or three months. "Unless the bandits are effectively defeated, they will never give up their attempt to occupy Sian." The Sian Pacification Headquarters is confident that the Nationalist army can resist the Communist bandits' attempt to advance west along the Longhai Railway. The Communist bandits have reached Tongguan, about a hundred miles from Sian, which is a fact; but during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Japanese army did not advance a step beyond Tongguan to approach Sian, and neither can the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sian, 23rd Dispatch] According to statistics from the Provincial Government, the county magistrates who died in Shaanxi Province while suppressing bandits include Wu Xuanhan, Magistrate of Mizhi County; Yan Junben, Magistrate of Xusu County; Xu Jisen, Magistrate of Jingbian County; Jiang Menghan, Magistrate of Yanchuan County; Wang Hongda, Magistrate of Shanyang County; Guo Ruisheng, Magistrate of Baishui County; Zhou Hong, Magistrate of Heyang County; Huang Jialin, Magistrate of Baihe County; Li Tonglian, Magistrate of Yongshou County; and Fang Benyu, Magistrate of Qingjian County, totaling ten officials. In addition to providing preferential treatment, the Provincial Government has also requested commendation from the Central Government.</p>

<h3>Sun Lianzhong Moves to Guide Youth Again: Establish the Spirit of Abiding by the Law; Those Who Willingly Act as Accomplices to Bandits Will Be Punished According to the Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] General Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the Capital Garrison, has repeatedly advised young students who were incited by Communist bandits to create student unrest and riots. In order to maintain social order and stability, he issued another statement as follows: "Since the beginning of constitutional governance, our country is striding forward on the road to democracy. Democratic countries emphasize the rule of law above all else, and young students should especially establish the spirit of abiding by the law to serve as a model for the general public. However, the Communist bandits are using a small number of professional students to infiltrate schools in our rear to conduct espionage activities, create student unrest, and incite illegal actions such as strikes and marches in order to coordinate with their military rebellion. As I am responsible for protecting the capital and ensuring social order and stability, I have repeatedly given earnest admonishments to students who are instigated by the Communist bandits to engage in illegal activities. However, the Communist bandits' professional students remain unrepentant and are stubbornly pursuing their calculated conspiracy. To those who are incorrigible and willingly act as accomplices to the bandits, we can only punish them according to the law. If there are any more illegal gatherings, marches, or petitions, the Interim Measures for Maintaining Social Order will be strictly enforced, and the school authorities are still hoped to properly persuade and stop such actions."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Spokesmen from both China and Britain have stated this week that both countries hope to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, but U.S. officials remain unenthusiastic. Bevin's words would have caused a strong reaction in the United States a year ago, but today they have fallen like a stone into the sea. According to reliable sources, the United States currently believes that convening a peace conference with Japan in the short term would be futile, as this move would only serve to show that the United States and the Soviet Union cannot agree on fundamental issues. Diplomatic circles here accuse the United States of deliberately delaying the peace conference. They claim that U.S. officials, knowing that other countries oppose the U.S. plan to rebuild the Japanese economy, have decided to postpone the peace conference for the time being. They accuse the United States of attempting to deal with Japan alone and, after the plan is successful, to convene a peace conference and submit the fait accompli to the conference.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Rice and Flour for China Approved by Hoffman</h3>

<h3>U.S. Officials in Tokyo State: Determined Not to Support Japanese Military; Washington is Very Indifferent to Various Conferences</h3>
<p>[United Press Asia Vice President Vaughn, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch] Top U.S. officials in Tokyo told reporters that the purpose of the U.S. plan to rebuild Japan is not only to enable the Japanese to have a satisfactory standard of living, but also to improve the standard of living of all Asians. General Walker has never thought of treating China or other Asian countries unfairly and providing special assistance to Japan. MacArthur and those who draft U.S. policy believe that the revival of Japan should be treated equally with the economic prosperity of all Asian countries. Some Chinese newspapers have claimed that the U.S. aid to Japan will endanger China's economic revival and will eventually lead to the resurgence of Japanese militarism. Senior Americans commented on this, saying: "China has suffered greatly, so it is natural for China to view the U.S. aid plan to Japan with suspicion, but the above-mentioned views of Chinese people are mistaken. The United States has taken all measures to ensure that Japan can never again pursue military, political, or economic aggression." The reporter met with MacArthur and talked many times. MacArthur absolutely felt that China is of great importance not only in the Far East but also in global affairs. MacArthur is absolutely unwilling to treat China or other countries specially and develop Japan. What MacArthur hopes for is a rigorous economic and political plan to promote cooperation among Asian countries and to promote economic cooperation between Asian countries and countries around the world.</p>

<h3>The Economic Problem of Blocking the Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>The necessary condition for the development of the economy is nothing more than a "通 (free flow/unrestricted)" character. Whether it is finance, trade, production, or transportation, if this condition cannot be met, or if it is met insufficiently, then all economic activities will definitely not show profit. Therefore, finance prioritizes 流通 (circulation), trade is also called 通商 (free trade), material exchanges require circulation, and rapid conversion is essential, all boil down to working on this one "通 (free flow/unrestricted)" character.</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, due to various reasons related to military affairs, finance, and currency, all measures have often moved in the opposite direction. Not to mention foreign exchange and international trade, focusing solely on the domestic front, there are restrictions on remittances, currency transfers, loans, the use of bills, and the opening of businesses and banks, etc., restricting the flow of currency to a very limited scope. Furthermore, governments at various levels often impose prohibitions on the free sale of many goods, and some goods, under forms of unified purchase or designated purchase, have long become the possessions of certain groups. Under such extreme forms of control, all activities related to transportation, sales, purchase, production, and storage must be subject to a certain degree of restriction. Therefore, the current economic policy, despite ostensibly promoting circulation, is actually causing headaches due to various artificial restrictions.</p>
<p>Since the communist bandits have been running amok and causing disturbances everywhere, the central government, in order to prevent materials from being used by the bandits and to cut off their economic resources, promulgated measures for the economic blockade of bandit areas in the spring of last year, implementing economic blockades in areas close to the war zones. This was originally a last resort. Furthermore, with Shanghai as an industrial and commercial center, communist bandits have been secretly transporting supplies to provide assistance. The military and police authorities have repeatedly disrupted these activities. Therefore, there have been proposals to implement the blockade measures in Shanghai. During this period of mobilization and unrest, military matters take precedence, and this is certainly a necessary move. To accomplish the task of suppressing the rebellion, we must deal a fatal blow to the enemy economically. To strike the enemy economically, we must prevent materials from being used by the enemy, thereby cutting off their economic resources. To accomplish this major task, even if we have to temporarily endure some sacrifices and inconveniences, it is believed that everyone will be happy to endure them.</p>
<p>However, to reduce unnecessary troubles, there are some practical suggestions that need to be raised here, and we ask the authorities to consider them carefully in advance. They are:</p>
<p>(1) The Issue of the Blockade Line: Where should the blockade be implemented? The main purpose of the blockade is to prevent materials from flowing into bandit areas. Therefore, the borders close to bandit areas and where materials can be transported to them are the ideal blockade lines. Other areas that are not close to bandit areas and where materials cannot be directly transported to them should be excluded. Because these areas have no transportation links with bandit areas, what is blocked is naturally not materials being transported to bandit areas, but materials that we use ourselves. If these self-used materials are also subject to embargoes, inspections, or licensing procedures, it will only increase the troubles of merchants and have nothing to do with the original purpose of preventing support for the bandits.</p>
<p>(2) The Issue of Purchasing Certificates: Since the purpose of the blockade is to prevent support for the bandits, then all materials that can support the bandits should be embargoed. If there are special reasons for granting exceptions, then proof should be provided to allow passage. The rescue of materials from bandit areas serves the same purpose as cutting off the economic resources of the bandit areas, and logically should be encouraged. As for purchasing goods in Shanghai and transporting them to non-bandit areas, or purchasing goods in non-bandit areas and transporting them to Shanghai, this has nothing to do with the blockade of bandit areas. We believe that unless otherwise specified by law, no procedures are required.</p>
<p>(3) The Issue of the Types of Goods: According to Article 5 of the regulations issued by the Executive Yuan on the blockade of transportation and economy in bandit areas, the local military and political organs should stipulate the types, names, and quantities of materials and finance restricted from passing through the blockade line. This indicates that not all goods are embargoed. Therefore, what types of goods and what quantities are included in the regulations should be carefully determined according to the actual situation and announced in advance to allow merchants to comply. Otherwise, merchants will be accused of violating the ban at any time and place, and it will only open the door for unscrupulous officials to engage in extortion and exploitation.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three points, how the tasks of the blockade line are implemented and how to prevent the unhealthy tendencies of making things difficult and soliciting bribes are certainly issues of common concern. During the Anti-Japanese War, whether in the party or in the rear, these painful lessons left too deep of an impression on people. We believe that the authorities will have sound plans in this regard.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are already too many restrictions in the economy. Economic blockade is related to the great strategy of suppressing the rebellion, so we must make efforts to implement it. However, in the fall when the economic sector is facing extreme difficulties, we hope to minimize all unnecessary obstacles and restrictions to avoid further deterioration. Shanghai is also the only large city in our country, with a population that has increased to five million. Most of the essential daily necessities must be supplied from the interior, and all kinds of goods and raw materials needed by various factories, as well as various manufactured products, must be exchanged with various places to maintain the entire system. Therefore, before implementing this blockade measure, how to coordinate and take into account all aspects, and carefully plan to maintain the life of industry and commerce while achieving the maximum effect of the blockade is indeed a major issue worthy of serious discussion. Otherwise, the bandit area will not be truly blocked, while our own industry and commerce will suffer the pain of strangulation, and our own people's livelihood will suffer serious oppression.</p>
<p>There are often many policies whose initial intentions are laudable, but the results are often counterproductive, merely opening up avenues for those who implement the policies to make a fortune. This is why we do not hesitate to use so many words to call on the government and society to pay attention to this issue of blocking the economy of bandit areas.</p>

The National Government immediately promulgated the order: "Chen Qimei, the former military governor of Shanghai, was a revolutionary pioneer who advocated joining the southeast and was determined to sacrifice himself. His heroic name will last forever.

Bai Wenwei, a member of the National Government, restored the province of Anhui and contributed to his homeland. He maintained his integrity in his later years and did not forget to make suggestions. Hao Mengling, commander of the 9th Army of the Army, and Li Jiayu, commander-in-chief of the 36th Army of the Army, supervised the troops in resisting the Japanese invasion and were victorious against the enemy. They defended the Central Plains, were loyal and devoted to the integrity. Qin Zhen, the vice president of the Judicial Yuan, supported the republic, promoted the rule of law, was loyal to the country, and unwavering from beginning to end. All of the above-mentioned martyrs have made great contributions, and their names shine in national history. It is appropriate to grant them a state funeral as a show of special honor.

<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Hong Xucai</p>
<p>Is it luck? Is it a coincidence? Or is it an unattainable opportunity? As a reporter, I had the opportunity to travel across half of China because of my participation in the Mount Jishi Exploration Team of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), enjoying the scenery of Central, Western, Southern, and Northwestern China. The provinces traversed include Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Xinjiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong and Hainan Island.</p>
<p>I arrived in Lanzhou on April 15th aboard the CNAC exploration plane. After the aerial exploration of Mount Jishi on the 16th, it was originally planned to fly to Chengdu the next day and transfer to Chongqing to take a flight back to Shanghai. As for the exploration plane, it was used by senior officials of CNAC to inspect business at various branch offices. I was fortunate enough to be squeezed into the "inspection" team and flew around. In ten days, I had been to Hankou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Liuzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Hainan Island, Shantou, Xiamen, Tainan, Taipei, and Fuzhou, totaling forty hours of flying time and more than 7,000 miles.</p>
<p>Looking back, this is truly an incredible miracle. It is impossible to complete such a long journey in just ten days. If you try to calculate the travel expenses, with air tickets being so expensive nowadays, the amount would probably be in the hundreds of millions. Moreover, with crowded passengers and limited routes, it is really not easy to travel to so many places at ordinary times, and it is unknown how much time it would take. This CNAC inspection plane was personally piloted by Deputy Manager Chen Wenkuan, so it could take off and land anytime and anywhere for business needs. Apart from the weather, it was not subject to any restrictions. This is naturally the main reason why it was able to fly such a long distance in a short period of time.</p>
<p>I have tried to calculate the cost of CNAC's inspection of business in various places this time. Just in terms of the special plane, it is already considerable. Leaving aside the daily production value that the special plane should have, the gasoline for this trip alone is already staggering. According to the average fuel consumption of the plane, which is 100 gallons per hour, 4,000 gallons of gasoline were consumed in forty hours. Calculated at the price of 260,000 yuan per gallon in Shanghai, the total gasoline price for the entire trip is more than one billion. What's more, the gasoline price in the mainland is twice as expensive as in Shanghai, and freight and other expenses are not included. No wonder Mr. Jin Chao, the engineer of CNAC, who is in his seventies, said to me: "We have worked in the company for twenty years, and we have only waited for such a generous opportunity, but you have encountered it, you are really lucky!</p>
<p>The people who accompanied the plane this time were Deng Gaozhang and Chen Wenkuan, Deputy Managers of CNAC, Chief Engineers Hang Xiaozu and Wen Liandong, Jin Chao, Deputy Pilot Zheng Jiechi, Communicator Xue Yingnian, Xiao Likun, Director of the Business Department of the Civil Aviation Administration, and nine people, including me. Our itinerary was like this: On April 15th, we took off from Longhua Airport in Shanghai, landed in Hankou and Xi'an to refuel, and arrived in Lanzhou that night, staying at the Northwest Reception Hall. The next afternoon at 1:00 PM, we flew to Mount Jishi for exploration and returned to Lanzhou at 8:00 PM, where we were specially invited to a dinner with Generals Zhang Zhizhong and Guo Jiqiao. On the tenth day morning, the exploration plane carried the reporter to Chengdu and transferred to Chongqing to take a flight back to Shanghai, so the reporters from various newspapers who participated in the Mount Jishi exploration safely returned to Shanghai on the 17th. The CNAC special plane for business inspection that I accompanied flew to Liuzhou on the 17th, stayed for only one meal, and then flew to Guangzhou. That night, Guangzhou Mayor Ouyang Ju hosted a dinner, and we stayed at the International Hotel Ai Qun. The next day, we flew directly to Hong Kong and landed at Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. Hong Kong is indeed a good place. Once people from other provinces arrive there, they immediately fall in love with it. On the other hand, it was also because Deputy Manager Deng was too busy with business, so we stayed in Hong Kong for the longest time, a total of two days and four nights. On the 22nd, the special plane flew to Hainan Island for a half-day tour. We first tasted Cantonese cuisine at Datong Restaurant in Haikou, which was endless. This island full of tropical flavor provided the reporter with a lot of fresh writing materials, which will be reported one by one. Returning from Hainan Island, we spent the last night in Hong Kong at the Lido Nightclub. On the morning of the 23rd, we flew directly to Shantou and visited Shantou Mayor Li Guojun, who accompanied the reporter to visit Zhongshan Park. In the afternoon of the same day, we flew to Xiamen and stayed at the Daxin Hotel facing Gulangyu Island. On the morning of the 24th, we flew directly to Tainan and transferred to Taipei. After lunch, we transferred to Fuzhou and returned to Shanghai. In Fuzhou, Lin Xianming and his wife, the director of the CNAC station, specially prepared a sumptuous Fuzhou local dish, and I was able to taste the famous coastal dishes. The special plane landed at Longhua Airport at around 10:00 PM that night.</p>
<p>During this trip, I went from the loess belt bordering the deserts of Mongolia and Tibet to the adventurer's paradise with the cleanest asphalt roads—Hong Kong; geographically speaking, it was from Lanzhou, the most central part of the motherland, across Vietnam to the southernmost peninsula on the map; in terms of climate, it was from an altitude of 12 degrees below zero to a subtropical zone above the boiling point. As for the differences in local customs, they are even more significant. From the simplicity, monotony, honesty, and poverty of the Northwest to the exoticism and joy of Qingdao, and then to the oriental colors of Taiwan under the sunlight, although there is a lot to see and hear along the way, it is inevitable that it is superficial and not in-depth because the stay in each place is short and cursory. But it is also because of this that there is no sense of numbness that comes from staying in one place for a long time. I came and went in a hurry, and my impressions of various places were very敏捷. It is easier to associate and produce strong comparisons with the living standards, social order, security situation, and customs of each place. It is my duty to gradually organize and publish them for the benefit of readers.</p>
<p>Here are excerpts of the route, distance, and time of this flight for reference:</p>

<p>Shanghai—Hankou 434 miles 2 hours and 40 minutes</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Refutes U.S. Statement: Accuses U.S. of Aiding Japan to Rebuild Military Power, Blames U.S. for Failure to Reach Disarmament Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Official sources here stated today that the Soviet Union's peace offensive will not affect U.S. foreign policy. The Soviet Union may take two actions in the future: make concessions on some major issues in the United Nations to show its intention to find a solution, and intensify comprehensive propaganda to show that Premier Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov hope to negotiate and end the Cold War, while President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall are obstructing this attempt. TASS's recent statement criticizing the current U.S. government's opportunistic policy shows that the Soviet Union may follow the second path.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 23rd] The Soviet Union yesterday again blamed the United States for the stalemate in the United Nations and foreign ministers' meetings on the issues of preparing for atomic energy, the German-Japanese peace treaty, and the delayed independence of Korea. Moscow Radio broadcast TASS's statement in the morning, expressing the aforementioned opinions, which are the opinions of Soviet leaders, intended to respond to the U.S. State Department's statement on Marshal Stalin's reply to Wallace's open letter. TASS's statement pointed out that the failure of the foreign ministers' meeting and the United Nations to reach an agreement on the aforementioned issues was due to the United States' firm opposition to various Soviet proposals. TASS specifically pointed out that the Potsdam Agreement stipulated that the German-Japanese peace treaty should be prepared by the foreign ministers' meeting, and accused the United States of supporting Japan's aggressive system and rebuilding Japan's economic power to undermine peace. Regarding the issue of foreign troops stationed in China, TASS pointed out that Soviet troops had withdrawn from China, while U.S. troops had not, and the expansion of the Chinese civil war was obviously due to the U.S. troops staying in China. Regarding the Korean issue, TASS stated that due to the United States' adoption of anti-democratic policies and support for reactionary and pro-Japanese groups, the United States and the Soviet Union could not reach an agreement on the independence of Korea.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] TASS issued a communiqué in response to the U.S. State Department's statement of May 19 on U.S.-Soviet relations, accusing the U.S. government of constantly undermining various international agreements, including Yalta, Tehran, and Potsdam. The United States has also violated the UN General Assembly's resolutions and implemented an arms race policy. The Soviet Union has put forward various proposals on the control of atomic armaments, but they have all been rejected by the State Department. The communiqué continued to mention various issues that hinder Soviet-U.S. relations, such as the German-Japanese peace treaty, the withdrawal of foreign troops from China and Korea, respect for national sovereignty, U.S. interference in the Italian elections, and the establishment of military bases by the U.S. in the territory of UN member states. TASS pointed out that the United States' maintenance of these bases increases international anxiety. Regarding foreign trade and European recovery, TASS stated that the Soviet Union had proposed carrying out European recovery work within the UN framework, but it was also rejected by the U.S. government. The United States has also spread pro-fascist ideas in Greece and other countries. TASS concluded that, based on the above, it is self-evident who is responsible for the current situation. The United States has now abandoned Roosevelt's policy and constantly undermines various international agreements, not only betraying the UN Charter, but also ignoring the UN organization. This attitude will never improve international relations.</p>
<h3>Wallace Broadcasts Another Speech: Challenges U.S. Foreign Policy Leaders: Demands a Debate on Current Policies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Spokane, Washington, 22nd] Wallace today challenged Senators Vandenberg, Marshall, or Connally in a broadcast, hoping to hold a series of debates to discuss United Nations foreign policy. Wallace claimed to challenge the foreign policy leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties in his capacity as a third-party presidential candidate.</p>
<p>He said, "In the past two weeks, the Soviet government has twice responded to the United States' proposal, believing that the time has come to end the Cold War. However, politicians from the government and the Democratic and Republican parties have poured cold water on the people's hopes for ending the Cold War. The government claims, "We have negotiated many times for this purpose, and we are tired of negotiating again."</p>
<p>But the people say, "We have fought for this goal before, and we are tired of fighting. What we need is peace."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Seattle, 22nd] U.S. presidential candidate Wallace said today that he felt the United States should, in a fair manner, invite the Soviet Union in open meetings to stop the spread of communism in other countries. But he also announced that methods of undermining the effects of the Communist Party were illegal, which was the first step in any joint action by the United States and the Soviet Union. When asked on a radio broadcast how he would seek an agreement with the Soviet Union if elected president, he replied that he believed the entire issue should be handled by a meeting of the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union. When asked whether the Communist Party supported his presidential campaign, he replied that he would resolutely refuse to support anyone who advocated the violent overthrow of the U.S. government.</p>

<h3>On-site Investigation of Former Italian Colonies Completed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] The Four Power Committee, which investigated the former Italian colonies, has completed its mission after conducting a six-month on-site investigation in various colonies. The committee members are currently in Rome, visiting various refugee camps and listening to the opinions of Italians returning from Africa.

<h3>Victoria Day Commemoration</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] Tomorrow is the anniversary of Queen Victoria's birth. In addition to the United Kingdom itself, which will only celebrate by hanging flags, government agencies and schools throughout the rest of the British Commonwealth will be closed for one day, and troops will be reviewed and speeches will be delivered. Since the war, Britain has undergone major political changes. India has been divided into two autonomous territories, and Burma and Ceylon have successively become independent. Cyprus and Malaya have also formulated new constitutions and obtained greater autonomy. In addition, the Palestine issue has made it impossible for Britain to dominate the world. The economy is exhausted and prosperity has disappeared. Recently, joining the Western European Alliance has caused fear among some politicians, who believe that Britain's strength may be sacrificed as a result. According to Foreign Minister Bevin, a meeting of the prime ministers of various autonomous territories will be convened soon to discuss major issues.</p>
<h3>Dewey Wins U.S. Republican Primary</h3>

His opponent, Stassen, has conceded defeat and, as usual, congratulated Dewey. Dewey's chances of obtaining the Republican nomination have become increasingly clear.</p>
<h3>Security Council Passes Resolution Ordering Armistice Between Arabs and Jews Today; US-Soviet Demand to Intervene in Holy Land War Rejected</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations Security Council last night failed to accept the US-Soviet proposal to authorize the UN to take strong action to halt the Palestine war. It only issued a second ceasefire order to both the Arab and Jewish sides.</p>
<p>The time limit is set for 5:00 PM on the 24th (2:00 AM on the 25th, Shanghai time). The final resolution passed by a vote of eight to zero, with Syria, the Soviet Union, and Ukraine abstaining. Before the final vote, US representative Austin stated that if the 36-hour ceasefire order is not obeyed, the United States will demand action.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] The replies of both the Arab and Jewish sides to the Security Council's written inquiries have been submitted to the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 22nd] Malik is about to replace Gromyko as the Soviet representative to the United Nations. He attended the Security Council's discussion on the Palestine issue for the first time this afternoon. This new Soviet statesman sat at the same table as the Soviet delegation headed by Gromyko.

<h3>Allied Nations May Form Another International Tribunal to Try Japanese Class A War Criminals; The Top 20 Include Kodama, Nishio, and Others</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] This reporter from the Central News Agency learned today that the Allied nations may soon organize another international tribunal to try the top 20 Class A Japanese war crime suspects currently detained in Sugamo Prison. This reporter visited Chinese prosecutor Xiang Zhexun yesterday, who predicted that the Allied nations may soon organize another international military tribunal to try the 20 major war criminals who have been detained for over two years without a verdict. The 20 war criminals currently detained in Sugamo Prison awaiting trial include many notorious Japanese military and political leaders who participated in conspiracies to rule China. Among them are those most hated by our compatriots, such as Kishi Nobusuke, one of the five Japanese leaders who ruled Manchuria and served as Minister of Commerce in the Tojo cabinet; Ando Kisaburo, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in South China; Nishio Shozo, former supreme commander of the Japanese army in China; Tada Shun, former vice chief of staff of the Japanese army; and Kodama Yoshio, former head of the "Kodama Agency," a Japanese naval special operations unit in Shanghai. This agency once ran rampant in central and southern China.</p>
<h3>British Official Officially Denies the Allegation of Using US Aid to Support Arabs; Bevin Hopes for Consistency in British and American Views on the Middle East</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] Reliable sources said on the 23rd that British Foreign Secretary Bevin told US Ambassador to the UK Douglas that he hopes the British and American views on Palestine and the Middle East can be consistent. A Foreign Office spokesman said that Douglas visited Bevin at the latter's invitation to discuss the Palestine issue. It is understood that Bevin pointed out that he does not want to see British and American opinions on the Palestine issue drifting further apart. During the meeting between Douglas and Bevin, they discussed the US Congress's plan to investigate whether Britain is using US aid to support Arab countries. However, officials emphasized that Bevin's main concern is the general sentiment surrounding the Holy Land issue. British officials declined to comment on the US Congress's investigation, but solemnly declared that the funds loaned to Britain by the United States have absolutely no connection with Britain's obligations to Middle Eastern countries. Although Britain hopes for Anglo-American coordination, London still believes that Truman's recognition of Israel was too rash.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Rapid Deployment Force Enters Bethlehem; Has Joined Forces with Foreign Legion; Arabs to Reject Jewish Offer of Truce in Jerusalem</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 23rd] The Egyptian Ministry of Defense officially announced that the Egyptian Army's rapid deployment force entered Bethlehem at dawn on the 23rd, only five miles from the Arab Legion besieging Jerusalem.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 23rd] Israeli aircraft bombed Arab forces in the Jerusalem area twice on the 23rd, dropping a total of ten bombs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The Jewish authorities, through Abba Eban, the Jewish Agency's representative to Lake Success, stated in the Security Council that they were prepared to accept an unconditional truce in Jerusalem, but the Arab side stated that they had repeatedly given the Jewish forces the opportunity to surrender, and now that the war is nearing its end, they would reject their surrender at this time.</p>
<h3>Jewish People Burned Down Factory on the South Coast of the Dead Sea</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Southern Shore of the Dead Sea Frontline, 22nd] The potash factory on the southern shore of the Dead Sea, which the Jewish people were proud of, has been abandoned by the Jewish people. The factory is worth over one million pounds. The Transjordanian Legion ordered the Jewish people there to surrender a few days ago, but unexpectedly, the Jewish people quietly boarded boats after setting the fire and fled from the Dead Sea. Some of the factory's buildings are still intact, but the company's offices and some parts of the team have been destroyed. Some valuable machinery has been removed by the Jewish people by plane. It is unlikely that the factory will be restored to its original state for some time.</p>
<h3>Philippine Hukbalahap Leader Blood Poisoning</h3>

<h3>Gandhi's Assassin to be Tried This Week</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New Delhi, 22nd] The trial of Gandhi's assassin, Godse, and eight accomplices will begin here next week. The exact date remains a secret, as the government fears it may incite riots. The police have implemented strict security measures to prevent bandits from robbing the assassin or silencing him with gunfire. The fortress walls surrounding the courthouse will be guarded by police at all times, and only reporters and others will be allowed to attend the trial, but they will be subject to inspection, and photography will be prohibited. Women will also not be allowed to carry purses. On the first day, the court will hear the prosecutor read the indictment and then adjourn for two weeks before hearing the testimony of 250 witnesses. The entire trial may be delayed until the hot summer before it can be concluded.</p>
<h3>Ruhr Issue Unresolved; Six-Nation Conference Stalls; France Still Emphasizes National Security</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] After returning to Paris on the weekend, the two French chief representatives to the six-nation conference in London to discuss the German issue, Deputy Foreign Minister Miotville and External Economic Minister Alphand, sources close to the French Foreign Ministry revealed that the six-nation conference has stalled due to the issue of international co-management of the Ruhr industrial region. No agreement has been reached on this matter throughout the week because the US Special Representative for the European Recovery Program Hoffman has the decision-making power to increase the allocation of Ruhr coal and steel, while the representatives of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium believe that this will hinder the previous agreement guaranteeing Western Europe a fixed percentage of Ruhr coal production. France and others believe that such agreements are necessary for their economic and security. Authoritative sources also revealed that France, the Netherlands, and Belgium have made substantial concessions on the US views regarding the future political structure of Germany, so they hope that the US can make concessions to France and others in the economic field. Although officials here expect an agreement to be reached eventually, they expect that other Allied nations will not allow Hoffman to have the power to veto the decisions made by the Allied nations on the Ruhr. French public opinion has become impatient with the repeated disregard for French security issues in the German issue talks.</p>
<h3>International Silk Conference; China Sends Three Participants</h3>

<h3>War Potential of the US and USSR</h3>
<p>— Translated by Weng Shaoqiu</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is currently striving to control the entire European continent. The United States has twice waged war to prevent enemy countries from controlling Europe. It is currently preparing to restrain the Soviet Union from further expansion, and will not hesitate to go to war if necessary.</p>
<p>The traditional policy of the United States is to prevent any country from single-handedly dominating Europe, because after dominating the European continent, it will gain the convenience of shipbuilding and obtain a base from which to challenge the US mainland and Western countries. Therefore, if the Soviet Union directly controls the countries of Western Europe, or it seems that the communist parties of various countries control Western Europe, it will cause the United States to fear that the Soviet air force may use Western Europe as a base.</p>
<p>Based on the above background, if the Soviet Union's plan to control the entire European continent is successful, then a US-Soviet war will be inevitable.</p>
<p>The war potential of the US and USSR is as follows:</p>
<p>Manpower is the most important condition at the start of a war. The Soviet Union will overwhelm the United States. The total number of industrial workers in the Soviet Union and Europe will reach 45.93 million, while the United States will only have 23.15 million. Even including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, it is not as many as the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Steel: The Soviet Union and Europe can produce 54 million tons of steel annually, while the United States can produce several million tons annually, but not all of it can be immediately used for war purposes. Therefore, the amount that the Soviet Union lacks is not as large as the number indicates.</p>
<p>Coal: If Europe and the Soviet Union cooperate in production, they can produce 580 million tons of coal annually, while the United States produces 683 million tons of coal annually.</p>
<p>Nitrogen: Nitrogen is needed during wartime for explosives and food production. The Soviet Union and Europe can manufacture 1.3 million tons annually, which is about the same as the US production.</p>
<p>Machine tools: The Soviet Union will have 27.5 million machine tools, and the United States will only have 30 million, but the United States is better equipped.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union controls all of Europe, its industrial strength will double its current level, but the Soviet Union will be unable to solve the problems involved in full-scale wartime industry. Even at full production, the production efficiency of the Soviet Union and Europe is still lower than that of the United States.</p>
<p>Moscow's real problem is how to make full use of European industry and manpower after it is seized.</p>
<p>Petroleum: Petroleum is the most important factor in modern warfare. This is where the Soviet Union faces difficulties. The transportation network in Western Europe requires a large amount of petroleum, but the Soviet Union and Europe are unable to supply it. The Soviet Union and Europe can produce at most 267 million barrels of petroleum annually, while the United States can produce 1.92 billion barrels annually.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union controls all of Europe, it will need to purchase large amounts of petroleum from South America, the Caribbean Sea, the Middle East, and the Dutch East Indies, but the US Air Force can quickly cut off the sources of petroleum listed above. It is of little benefit for the Soviet Union to seize Middle Eastern oil fields, because it will be unable to transport the oil. Middle Eastern petroleum must pass through the Mediterranean Sea, but the British and American navies will control the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Soviet Union has neither the air force nor the naval power to cut off US petroleum supplies.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war, the United States will be able to obtain the main raw materials for the war from all over the world, but the Soviet Union will only be able to obtain raw materials from the areas it controls. Other sources of raw materials will be cut off by the US Air Force and Navy.</p>
<p>The main war materials that the Soviet Union lacks are as follows:</p>
<p>Aluminum: Aluminum is the raw material for manufacturing aircraft bombs and combat fleets. The amount of aluminum produced by the United States far exceeds what the Soviet Union and Europe can manufacture. The European continent can only produce 380,000 tons of aluminum annually, but the United States can produce 1.23 million tons annually. Adding the 500,000 tons produced by Canada, the US-Soviet aluminum production ratio is five to one.</p>
<p>Copper: Copper is the main raw material for manufacturing any military equipment. The United States also has more abundant copper production than the Soviet region. The Soviet Union and Europe can produce 305,000 tons of copper annually, while the United States produces three times that amount.</p>
<p>The lack of technical talent and industrial management talent is also the Soviet Union's fatal weakness. If European industry can obtain raw materials, it is doubtful whether the Soviet Union's industrial output will be close to the amount produced by Hitler. Because Hitler had a group of industrial management and technical talents, the Soviet Union lacks such experts, and at the same time, Western Europe will not be willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union after it is occupied.</p>
<p>Lack of transportation is another obstacle for the Soviet Union. Once a war breaks out, this obstacle will soon become apparent. There are only three main railway lines running through Eastern and Western Europe. Since the second railway in eastern Germany has been removed, the three transportation lines have been weakened.</p>
<p>The US Air Force can take off from the United Kingdom, the Middle East, and North Africa to bomb the entire transportation network of the European continent.</p>
<p>The Danube River is the only waterway on the European continent, running through Western Europe and the Soviet Union, with an annual transportation volume of 2 million tons, but the mines dropped by the US Air Force will severely damage this transportation line. If the Soviet Union wants to supply France and Italy, it must pass through the Mediterranean Sea, but the US Navy and Air Force will definitely block it.</p>
<p>Lack of food and clothing is even more difficult for the Soviet Union at the start of the war, and it weakens European power, making it impossible to prolong the war.</p>
<p>During the war, the source of food transported by the Soviet Union and Europe from the Americas and North Africa will definitely be cut off, and the Soviet Union and its vassal states will not be able to make up for the loss of food. At the same time, due to transportation disturbances, if there is food, it is impossible to transport it. As a result, it will inevitably affect industry, because workers do not have enough food, and work efficiency will drop sharply.</p>
<p>The situation with clothing will be even more serious than with food. If the source of clothing is cut off, the civilians of Europe and the Soviet Union will almost not be able to obtain any textiles. On the contrary, the United States has an inexhaustible source of food and clothing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, based on the facts above, after the Soviet Union controls Europe, the designers must immediately develop the economy of Western Europe. The increase in industrial power when the Soviet Union controls Europe may be greater than the industrial power when Hitler launched World War II, but it is still weaker than the United States. Just like playing a game of cards, if the Soviet Union's struggle against the United States is prolonged, the cards that are unfavorable to him will definitely pile up.

<h3>Rebuilding the Western District of Zhabei; The Executive Yuan Approves the Reconstruction Plan; The First Phase of Funding is Set at 500 Billion</h3>
<p>The western district of Zhabei in this city was designated as a blockade zone during the enemy and puppet regime. Since the victory, the area has been devastated due to air raids and other destructions, and has become a shantytown for refugees. Recently, the Land Administration Bureau, together with various relevant agencies, drafted a plan for reorganizing the Zhabei area and submitted it to the municipal government for approval by the Executive Yuan, which has been approved for implementation recently. It is understood that the western district of Zhabei has approximately 1,900 mu of land, of which private farmland owned by citizens accounts for approximately four-fifths, and government public places account for only one-fifth. Now that the Executive Yuan has approved it, the government has decided to build on one-half of the land, and the remaining one-half will be returned to the original landowners. The Public Works Bureau attaches great importance to this construction project. In addition to designing the streets according to the plan and drawing up plans, it also invited Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Wang Ziyang, a member of the Public Works Committee, and others to hold a meeting to discuss the construction project and economic fundraising in detail, and has decided: (1) The building construction will adopt a joint-style construction. According to this style, the zoning map will be revised and sent to the Land Administration Bureau as the basis for household land division. (2) Roads and ditches should be built and completed as soon as possible. (3) The cost of the first phase of construction is estimated at 500 billion yuan, which will be invested by various banks. (4) Negotiate with the China Bank and Farmers Bank to invest in municipal improvements. (5) Request the Central Trust of China to invest in building houses for sale at low prices. (6) Issue a second house charity lottery.</p>
<h3>Flood Prevention Project in the Second Half of the Year; Funding Needs 130 Billion; Meeting Today to Review Project Plans</h3>
<p>The Municipal Flood Prevention Project Committee is scheduled to hold a committee meeting at 3:00 PM today in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Mayor Wu, who is also the chairman, will preside. Deputy Chairmen Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiqi, Secretary Zhao Zukang, and other committee members will attend to review the flood prevention project plan for the second half of this year and discuss fundraising for flood prevention. According to the person in charge of the Drainage Engineering Office of the Public Works Bureau: The area of ​​water accumulation in the city is extremely large. After the efforts to launch flood prevention work last year, the situation of water accumulation has not been as serious as before. The most obvious examples are: (1) Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road were originally famous areas of water accumulation. Now, because the household ditch project has been completed, water no longer accumulates. (2) The area near the 13-story building in the Old Concession area used to accumulate water over Teng every time there was a tide or heavy rain. After a pumping station was placed in the Rihui Port, the problem of water accumulation has been resolved. The flood prevention project from June to December of this year is also an important task. The main projects are in two locations, one near Risheng Building on Nanjing Road and the other in the Fanhuangdu Road-Jiangsu Road area. The above two locations are the most serious water accumulation areas, and the budget is estimated at 130 billion yuan. As for this project plan, the Risheng Building part plans to lay a 30-inch diameter relief ditch starting from Tianjin Road, passing through Zhejiang Road, Ningbo Road, and Liuhe Road, and directly connecting to Tibet Road. The western Shanghai part plans to open up two new roads, Jiangsu North Road and Wuning Road, and install 54-inch ditch pipes. The opening of the two new roads will be carried out according to the urban planning routes. When building the roads, efforts will be made to accommodate the existing ground buildings.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Allocation Plan; Submitted to President Chiang for Approval</h3>
<p>The highest authorities are extremely concerned about the recent price situation in Shanghai. When summoning Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and Wu Guozhen, Mayor of Shanghai, they both inquired and instructed them. It is understood that Xuan Tiewu had previously suggested to the authorities that in order to effectively stabilize prices and completely solve the livelihood problems of the general public, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive allocation of various daily necessities. Later, Xuan was ordered to conduct a general and accurate survey of the actual supply and consumption of various daily necessities in Shanghai in order to provide a basis for implementing a comprehensive allocation. This work was carried out by the Economic Group of the Garrison Department in conjunction with relevant parties. It took two months and was completed recently. When Xuan was summoned to Beijing to meet President Chiang, he presented this survey report and the specific plan for implementing a comprehensive allocation to the President for review.</p>
<h3>Is Stockpiling Rayon a Crime? Police Bureau Inquires About Legal Basis</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau previously cracked two cases of stockpiling rayon in Nos. 7 Taozhuli, Shijian Road, Hou Mingde, Wang Shunchang, and No. 5 Taihefang, Shandong Road, Li Zhixiang. After being transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, they decided not to prosecute because rayon was not a controlled daily necessity. The bureau believes that it is necessary to clarify the legal provisions on whether stockpiling rayon is a crime, and also believes that the reasons for not prosecuting the two cases still need to be inquired. It has now sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau to inquire about the legal basis in order to avoid difficulties in future enforcement.</p>
<h3>Repairing Alleyway Lights; Disputes Often Arise Due to Fees</h3>
<p>Violations Can Be Reported to the Bureau Immediately</p>
<p>The French Concession Electricity Company in this city has always been responsible for the repair costs of alleyway lines within the transmission area, which has often caused disputes over the collection of these costs in the past. The company has even used power outages as a means of retaliation. According to a reporter's interview with the department in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, the bureau has strictly ordered the company not to arbitrarily cut off the power to alleyway lines due to the issue of collecting repair costs in order to protect the interests of users. Even if it is necessary, it should first be submitted for approval and handled by the bureau. Other power outages caused by wind and rain damage to the lines must be repaired within three days. If the project is major and cannot be repaired within three days, it must also be submitted for approval and filed. The labor and material costs for repairing alleyway lines must be jointly assessed by the Public Utilities Bureau, and no overcharges are allowed. The bureau also stated that if the company does not follow the above steps or has other circumstances that increase the burden on users, users can report it as much as possible, and it will be handled quickly.</p>
<h3>The Gold and Foreign Currency Case of the Ocean Transportation Company; Continuous Investigation and Trial Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The continuous investigation and trial of the persons involved in the Ocean Transportation Company's operation of the black market for gold and foreign currency, including the company's former manager Huang Zhong, Peng Bingcheng, and the foreign whistleblower Du Luosui, by the economic authority of the city's highest military authority has come to an end.

According to the amended regulations on the punishment of buying and selling gold and foreign currency, the case will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today for legal action.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's News Photos to be Shipped to Hangzhou for Exhibition Starting on the 25th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The news photograph exhibition held by this newspaper to celebrate the President's inauguration has been extremely popular since it opened at the Lake Society on the 19th.

<h3>Embezzlement Case in Zhabei District Rice Distribution; District Head Additionally Accused</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Eighth Bao Chief of Zhabei District, Chuan Daosheng, Deputy Bao Chief He Chaoliang, Bao Clerk Chen Zuosan, and District People's Representative Ni Luolin, etc., are accused of embezzlement in the distribution of rice for the extremely poor. The case is currently under investigation by the District Procuratorate. The plaintiffs, citizens Zhang Yiming and Zheng Chaozhen of the Bao, have accused the Zhabei District Head, Wang Zhiping, of colluding with the defendants in the embezzlement. They recently submitted a statement to the District Procuratorate, adding Wang Zhiping as a defendant. The reasons are approximately two points: (1) In the August 1947 distribution of rice for the extremely poor, there was no statistical register of the extremely poor population beforehand or afterward. The register was compiled and falsified after the incident. This shows that the upper and lower levels colluded to instigate corruption. (2) In the January 1948 distribution of rice for the poor, the People's Survey Committee originally stipulated one dou per large mouth and five sheng per small mouth. However, Wang changed the regulations and handled it arbitrarily, issuing only four sheng of rice per mouth. The excess amount was not publicly announced, which is another ironclad proof of embezzlement. The District Procuratorate will summon the relevant people for interrogation in the coming days.</p>
<h3>German Youth's False Report of Theft Exposed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A German youth named Crick, 27 years old, residing in room 331 of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, is engaged in the business of buying and selling jewelry on behalf of customers. The day before yesterday, Crick suddenly went to the Old Zha Police Precinct to report that at noon on the same day, while riding the No. 22 French Concession public bus near Middle Zhongzheng Road, he was robbed of a platinum diamond brooch weighing more than six carats, with a market value of 1.8 billion Legal Tender. In addition, 900,000 Legal Tender and four US dollars were also lost at the same time, requesting investigation. The Precinct Chief Zhao Zhaosheng immediately ordered Judicial Section Chief Jiang Shangpei and Section Member Song Shaomei to dispatch personnel for investigation. Subsequently, according to the testimony of another German colleague residing at Crick's residence, there were obvious discrepancies with Crick's report. It was determined that there must be another hidden situation in the case. Crick was brought to the station for detailed questioning, and it was finally determined that the case was actually a false report of theft by Crick, attempting to embezzle the valuable ornament. At the same time, the police also recovered the original stolen goods at the residence of Crick's friend, Bai Laman (residing at No. 77, Lane 343, Huade Road). According to Bai's confession, the item was deposited by Crick. Crick was detained and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate today on charges of false reporting and embezzlement.</p>

<h3>Identity of Female Corpse in Wuzhou Hotel Murder Case Determined; Murderer is the Deceased's Husband; Committed the Crime Under Nervous Derangement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Wuzhou Hotel at No. 517 Guangdong Road, on the afternoon of the 9th of this month, a tragic case occurred in which a young female guest was murdered and her body was hidden under the bed. The situation of the corpse's discovery was reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the Old Zha Police Precinct in charge of the case has been investigating the matter since the incident and has traveled by boat with hotel waiter Deng Qibao to various places in Haimen to track down the murderer, but has not yet arrested him. It is reported that the murderer, Yu Xingbai, is 23 years old and lives at No. 13, Block 8, Section 1, Wenwu Township, Haimen. His father, Yu Shixin, co-owns the Futai Hardware and Sundries Store at No. 111 Ximen Avenue. Shixin has five sons, and the murderer Yu Xingbai is the eldest son. He graduated from Haimen High School and was later admitted to the Qianghua Vocational School, but was expelled from school for misconduct after less than a month. He was unemployed at home and had an affair with Shen Zhufeng, the daughter of Shen Zhang, a neighbor. He asked his father to marry Shen as his wife, but Yu Shixin strongly opposed because he disliked Shen's family for being poor. Xingbai was deeply stimulated mentally, and once fled with the woman. She was found by Shen's mother, who questioned Yu's family aggressively. Later, Yu's uncle came forward to mediate, and the lovers were finally married. This year, during Qingming, Yu Xingbai planned to come to Shanghai to do business. He borrowed a piece of cotton yarn from his father, sold it for more than 100 million yuan, and used it as capital. He came to Shanghai with Shen and lived together in the Wuzhou Hotel. Unexpectedly, the tragedy occurred on the 9th of this month. The police investigation concluded that the murderer may have committed the crime in a moment of nervous derangement. On the 13th of this month, the bureau received a report that a young man had committed suicide on wasteland of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Jiangwan. His age and appearance were very similar to the murderer. The bureau sent personnel to detain the corpse coffin and transferred it to the Changde Road Morgue for examination. The result of the autopsy confirmed that it was not Yu Xingbai. The bureau is still continuing its pursuit.</p>

<h3>Gong Stage Again Disturbed; Losses Exceed 200 Million in Half a Day; Police Department Sends Adjutant to Investigate and Report for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, more than a dozen people in uniform suddenly came to the Gong Stage on Middle Zhongzheng Road. Seeing that the gate was not open, they went around to the back door and opened the gate themselves. Subsequently, people in uniform arrived at the theater one after another and sat upstairs and downstairs. At 1:05, seeing that the performance had not yet started, they caused a disturbance, and several people even tried to rush into the backstage. At that time, the order in the theater was chaotic, and the general male and female viewers scrambled to avoid the disturbance, and went out one after another to request refunds. The front desk witnessed this situation, and in order to avoid losses, they had to start the performance. After the play was over, they dispersed. The loss of half a day is calculated to be about 200 million yuan. During the chaos, the theater called the military, police, and law enforcement authorities for assistance. The military police team dispatched two squads of military police to the scene, but due to the disparity in numbers, they were unable to persuade them. The garrison headquarters dispatched Foreign Affairs Adjutant Tao Jinyi to the theater to investigate and report to the superiors for approval.</p>

<h3>Sun Tianchang Case; New Evidence to be Discovered; A Large Number of Bayonets Buried Underground in the Motley Factory; Two Criminals to be Sent to Beijing for Trial Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Sun Tianchang, a traitor who was previously reported for the suspicion of providing military supplies to the enemy and was acquitted by the military court, was recently secretly reported to the Ministry of National Defense for concealing military supplies. The Ministry of National Defense sent personnel to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation with the Ninth Regiment of Military Police. Copper coins were found in 57 boxes in the interlayer of the wall of the former British Motley Piano Store on Huimin Road, and dozens of artillery observation instruments were found in a warehouse on North Shaanxi Road. Sun Tianchang is currently being held by the Ninth Regiment of Military Police. It is reported that the secret informant in this case is a staff member and worker under Sun's command when he was the factory director of Motley. In addition to the above-mentioned copper coins and military observation instruments in the secret report, there are still a large number of bayonets, which are said to have been hidden by Sun Tianchang underground at the Motley factory site. Initially, eleven underground caves were dug for burial, and the ground was completely covered with cement. The personnel of the Ministry of National Defense, who are responsible for investigating this case, are quite troubled by the excavation of these bayonets, because the ground has long been paved with cement, and the exact location of the eleven underground caves where the bayonets are buried is difficult to determine. Moreover, the site of the Motley Piano Store is now the property of the US Consulate, making it difficult to excavate the entire factory site. The responsible personnel will return to Beijing for instructions in the coming days. Sun Tianchang and his assistant Yin Zhongbi, who was arrested at the same time, will be sent to Beijing for trial today. In addition, regarding the copper coins and observation instruments that were seized, the informant also mentioned them when the military court tried Sun Tianchang. Later, because the military court failed to find these items, it acquitted him on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Now that the physical evidence has been found, the old case may be reopened, and those who were previously responsible for the prosecution and trial may be involved. It is reported that the personnel of the Ministry of National Defense have reviewed all the case files of Sun Tianchang's previous trials in the High Court and military court.</p>
<h3>Clothing Burial Held for Martyr Zhang Xiaotong; Widow Was So Grieved at the Graveside that She Wanted to Commit Suicide; Memorial Service Held by Various Circles at Fazang Temple</h3>
<p>Martyr Zhang Xiaotong, a former member of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, was ordered to stay in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War to engage in underground work. He was resented by the enemy and puppets and was finally lured and arrested by Su Nichengde, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Director (who was executed last autumn in Shanghai Tilanqiao). He was brutally murdered by the enemy in the Dashugen area of Nanjing. His remains were not found after the victory. Yesterday at 3:00 p.m., his family held a clothing burial for Martyr Zhang at the Hongqiao Cemetery. A complete set of clothing and a foot-square wooden box containing Martyr Zhang's birth dates, covered with the Party emblem, were placed in the tomb. At 3:00 p.m., the tomb lid was lowered and mourning music was played. At that time, Martyr Zhang's widow, Ms. Chen Shaoqing, was overwhelmed with emotion and grief. She wanted to throw herself into the tomb to commit suicide. Relatives and friends who were attending the funeral were shocked and rushed forward to pull her back and support her to sit down on the ground. Mrs. Zhang continued to weep. During the public memorial service, Mrs. Zhang stepped forward to kneel and kowtow her forehead heavily on the tomb lid several times, almost fainting. Relatives and friends, fearing an incident, helped her into a car to return home to rest when the funeral was over.</p>
<p>In addition, at the memorial service for Martyr Zhang at Fazang Temple on Ji'an Road yesterday morning, there were more than 200 people who came to pay their respects, including Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Director Wu Kaixian, Director Zhao Zukang, and colleagues from Shen Bao, which was extremely solemn.</p>

According to the engineer in charge of the construction, a total of more than 30 billion yuan has been spent on the hospital. If calculated at the current value, it is worth more than 250 billion yuan. The construction funds are borne by the Social Welfare Enterprise Committee organized by Director Wu of the Social Bureau and Director Zhang of the Health Bureau. After the hospital is established, it will be a model for all hospitals in the city. As for the position of president of the hospital, Director Wu of the Social Bureau and Director Zhang of the Health Bureau are currently trying to persuade suitable talents to take the post. The internal layout and medical distribution will be planned after the president is appointed. Therefore, the opening ceremony scheduled for June 6 will be postponed. After the hospital is established, the administrative and technical promotion work will be the responsibility of the Hospital Affairs Committee. In addition to medical personnel, people from the government, capital, and labor will also be appointed as members. Regarding equipment, Director Zhang of the Health Bureau is currently trying to raise funds. The items that have already been settled include 250 beds and an X-ray machine, which were donated by the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Supplied Agricultural Equipment; Original Plan to Establish Factories Changed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) supplied China with more than 60,000 tons of equipment to manufacture agricultural implements, valued at US$8 million, which has now arrived. According to the original UNRRA plan, in addition to establishing a general factory in Shanghai, 18 branch factories and 3,000 iron workshops would be opened in various places. Due to the limitations of domestic repair conditions and various difficulties encountered during implementation, the plan has been revised by the Post-War Enterprise Management Committee and the China Agricultural Machinery Company. Equipment and machinery will be sold at low prices to farmers, the 18 branch factories will be reduced to eight, and the original equipment will be used to equip the Shanghai General Factory. The rest will be sold to the China Agricultural Machinery Company. The existing Wusong General Factory will be expanded to engage in industrial production in addition to manufacturing agricultural implements, meeting the needs of the local industrial community. The Qiujiangqiao Factory of the company will continue to handle the establishment, management, and training of personnel for the branch factories in various districts. National undertakings will be entrusted by the Management Committee to the company for implementation with allocated funds. In addition, the construction of the four branch factories in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, and Changsha will be completed within one year. The equipment for the Changsha branch factory will be shipped to various branch factories by mid-August at the latest, and industrial production will be undertaken to meet local needs. The above new plan is based on the current domestic situation, striving to be practical and to enable all UNRRA equipment to quickly exert its maximum effect. The estimated cost is approximately US$4 million.</p>
<h3>The Fisheries Administration's Two Rounds of Exports: A Fishing Demonstration at Duck Nest Sand</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Fuxing Island rose to prominence during the gold hiding case. Although time has passed, when our reporter traverses this fertile land, there is still a strange feeling. Gold, of course, was not found, but materials of even greater value than gold are piled up everywhere. However, no one knows the underlying reason why these materials are not being exploited. Many are quietly lamenting!</p>
<p>The Fisheries Administration has mounds of foreign pine, canvas, hemp ropes, and equipment piled up like mountains. It is said that the Post-War Fisheries Rehabilitation Materials Management Committee will convene a meeting of coastal provincial and municipal governments and fisheries representatives next month, after which the timber will be distributed to build ships, and all equipment will be allocated. But the timing seems too late. Haven't we seen two hundred pairs of Japanese fishing boats already overstepping their bounds in our offshore waters? Such things are often discovered. When Japanese ships see our fishing boats, they even throw away their nets and flee. But fleeing is just temporary; intimidation is not as thorough as resistance based on real strength.</p>
<p>One Net Pulled Up Empty</p>
<p>To clearly demonstrate fishing operations, the Fisheries Administration specially dispatched two of the ten large American fishing boats, the "Wisconsin" and the "Virginia," to take reporters outside the Wusongkou. The captain said: Normally, motorboats must sail four hours outside the Wusongkou to find schools of fish in the seabed. Because time was limited, the two boats stopped at Duck Nest Sand as a "demonstration." At this time, there were no winds or waves. At precisely 3:40 PM, the fishing net was unloaded from the deck of the "Virginia" into the muddy river water, gradually drifting away and sinking. Finally, planks were lowered on both sides of the ship to open the mouth of the net. Everyone was waiting for a joyous moment, but in less than fifteen minutes, the winch began to raise the net. The crew, dressed like firefighters, hauled up the dripping wet fishing net in three sections. As a result, the "cod end" (the end for holding the fish) was completely empty. When the same message came from the other boat via wireless telephone, everyone was disappointed. The captain explained further: They fish in the deep sea, and it takes at least two or three hours to pull up one net. Besides, the fish in Duck Nest Sand have long been scared away by the constant traffic of ships.</p>
<p>Drifting on the Ocean, Experiencing Hardships</p>
<p>Their description of actual fishing work is quite moving. When the wind and rain are dark, and the waves tower into the sky, a small boat drifting on the boundless ocean is truly terrifying. Especially in violent storms, it is common to have teeth knocked out or hands and feet broken when raising the net. As for those who are swept into the sea, there are quite a few. It is said that once, an engine failed offshore, and they were unable to drop anchor due to the wind and waves. So, a foreign crew member and a Chinese crew member rowed a sampan to take the anchor out, but the foreign crew member never returned. Few people understand these hardships. They say that each trip to sea lasts about ten days, and they work twenty-four hours a day, fighting the wind and waves with their lives. But when people pick up a chopstick of "sweet and sour yellow croaker," who knows that every fish on the plate represents hardship?</p>
<p>Yellow Croaker Passing By with a Terrifying Roar</p>
<p>Speaking of yellow croaker, the two months after Qingming Festival each year are a peak season. It is common to catch tens of thousands of catties in one net, and sometimes so many that they cannot be hauled onto the boat, so they have to "release" some. The male yellow croakers chase the females, swimming through the sea with a terrifying roar. But it is said that this year, the focal point of this group has not been found. The Fisheries Administration caught 3.2 million catties in March and April this year, worth 87.6 billion yuan, but compared to previous years, the difference is too great.</p>
<h3>Exquisite Kitchen, Soft Simmons Mattress</h3>
<p>It is necessary to introduce these two fishing boats. Like other American fishing boats, they have highly superior performance, averaging around 120 tons with 250 horsepower. They can travel nine nautical miles per hour. The fish capacity of one boat can reach up to 100 tons. The equipment inside includes a wireless telephone for communicating with other boats at any time, and all kinds of first aid medicines. There is also an exquisite kitchen and a soft Simmons mattress.</p>
<p>As the person in charge of the Fisheries Administration said, from the mouth of the Yalu River to the southernmost Tokyo Bay, such a long coastline, equipped with only 126 motorized fishing boats (60 American ships and 66 Australian ships from post-war materials), is truly pitifully small. This can only be said to be the beginning of motorized fishing in China. What is hoped is that this fragile lineup can establish a permanently unshakeable foundation for the fishing industry.</p>
<p>Crew Recalls Past Events, Full of Terror. They Exchange Their Lives Battling with the Stormy Waves.</p>

<p>Weekly Economy Edited by the China Industrial and Commercial Association</p>
<h3>Rising Commodity Prices: Authorities Frequently Exert Pressure, the Tide of Price Increases Slightly Subdued</h3>
<p>The trend of commodity prices this year, after a surge in the second week of March, maintained a relatively stable state, advancing gradually, until April. This process lasted about seven weeks.</p>
<p>From the first half of May, that is, the first two weeks before last week, a cyclical wave of price increases started again. According to the commodity price index compiled by this publication and classified by purpose, the total index rose by 9.21% in the first week of May and 27.82% in the second week. The authorities immediately paid close attention and frequently exerted pressure in an attempt to curb it.</p>
<p>Following this trend last week, with the government selling off materials on one hand and tightening credit on the other, the tide of price increases in general has gradually slowed. Although there were mixed increases and decreases, gains and losses were seen, but the amplitude was narrower. The total index rose by only 1.20%.</p>
<p>Credit was quite tight last week. The exchange at the national bank was in deficit by more than one trillion on Wednesday and Thursday. The black market interest rate was also quite chaotic, ranging from 30% to over 40%. The exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar has been gradually decreasing since the beginning of the week. The relevant price factors last week are roughly analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>First, the government continued to implement its policy of selling off materials, which began during the surge of the previous week. On Monday, in addition to the usual sale of cotton yarn by the China Textile Construction Company, it also sold twelve types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee in the cotton yarn market, selling 568 pieces in total. It also sold 35 types of cotton cloth and three types of bedsheets, selling 20,380 bolts of cotton cloth and 60 bedsheets in total. At the meeting of the Food Sugar Group of the Price Review Committee on Monday, it was decided that the allocation price of the 21st phase of Taiwan sugar would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to sell thirteen types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee in the market, selling 821 pieces in total.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to sell four types of cotton, selling a total of 8,600 market dan, and fifteen types of cotton yarn, selling 1,182 pieces in total. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee allocated a total of 2,380 shi of second-grade white japonica rice and hsien rice, with an allocation price of 5.4 million yuan per shi for white japonica rice and 5.2 million yuan per shi for hsien rice.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the China Textile Construction Company sold four types of cotton, totaling 7,990 market dan, and thirteen types of cotton yarn, totaling 869 pieces. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee sold a total of 3,760 shi of white japonica rice and hsien rice, with the allocation price of white japonica rice raised to 5.5 million yuan per shi and the allocation price of hsien rice raised to 5.3 million yuan per shi.</p>
<p>On Friday, the China Textile Construction Company sold three types of cotton, totaling 5,545 dan, and eleven types of cotton yarn, totaling 904 pieces.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to sell three types of cotton, totaling 1,800 dan, and thirteen types of cotton yarn, totaling 1,176 pieces. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee sold a total of 2,743 shi of various types of rice.</p>
<p>Second, in order to suppress commodity prices, in addition to selling off materials, the authorities also massively tightened credit. It is said that effective measures have been taken since the 14th, and until recently, the total deficit of national banks has exceeded six trillion. However, remittances from North China, Northwest China, and Central China have flooded in, and large amounts of cash have been transported, so the effect of tightening credit has not been fully realized.</p>
<p>Third, strengthened control. Since the National Bank tightened credit in the previous week, the number of returned checks has increased, reaching a staggering 1.4 trillion at the end of the previous week, setting an unprecedented record. The Gold Management Bureau immediately conducted a thorough investigation. For banks and firms, their names will be announced and they will be severely punished. Customers will be transferred to the court for investigation. In addition, the President and Vice President are scheduled to be inaugurated on the 20th, so speculators are inevitably wary.</p>
<p>Fourth, the exchange rate benchmark of the Stabilization Committee, which had been stable for more than a month after being adjusted on April 6, suddenly saw an adjustment on Monday. Various exchange rates rose by an average of 46%. The US dollar rose from 324,000 yuan to 474,000 yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan; the British pound rose from 972,000 yuan to 1,422,000 yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan; other Hong Kong dollar and Indian rupee exchange rates also increased proportionally.</p>
<p>According to past adjustments to the exchange rate benchmark price, the market was always stimulated, and commodity prices rose, causing an uproar. Although the market price fluctuated slightly this time, the impact was far less than in the past. This is because the listed price before this adjustment was less than one-third of the black market exchange rate and had long been detached from reality, so it had little stimulating effect on general commodity prices.</p>
<p>In addition, the measures related to commodity prices last week that can be mentioned are:</p>
<p>(1) The National Bank issued two types of short-term treasury bills, one due at the end of May and the other due in mid-June. It is said that this measure is to facilitate the financing of funds for the industrial and commercial sectors so that they can settle accounts upon maturity. The issuance discount is still determined daily.</p>
<p>(2) The source of funds for general business loans from national banks was previously stipulated by the Four-Bank Joint Office to be self-absorbed deposits. The deposit interest rate has recently been approved by the Four-Bank Joint Office to be increased from 8% per annum to 4% per annum, and the lending rate has been increased to 1.8% per month. This is also an example of national banks gradually breaking away from the past low-interest policy.</p>
<p>(3) According to the United Credit Investigation Institute, the new Sino-Hong Kong agreement is being negotiated between the Chinese and Hong Kong governments and will be finalized soon. The final decision can be made after the establishment of the new government.</p>
<p>It is learned that the content of the new agreement is based on controlling the Hong Kong market. The implementation steps will eliminate the free trading in the Hong Kong market. The Hong Kong government will prohibit the establishment of speculative commercial and financial institutions. If this can be achieved, it will be able to stop the activities of the gold and cash black market, which will be of great benefit to stabilizing our finances. This matter is being negotiated by representatives of the Central Bank, and it is heard that the Hong Kong government has expressed its willingness to assist.</p>
<p>The market trend of commodity prices last week, under the two major pressures of government selling off materials and tightening credit, was in a state of wanting to rise but stopping. Unfortunately, the influx of funds from other ports meant that the effect of tightening credit was not fully apparent.</p>
<p>The Chinese and foreign stock markets have always been hovering stably, with relatively narrow fluctuations. The details will be described in the stock market section below.</p>
<p>In terms of yarn and cloth, due to the authorities tightening credit and the Yarn Management Committee selling off large quantities, the trend is also stable. 42-count Blue Phoenix has always been fixed between 290 million and 300 million. Coarse yarn rose slightly. For example, 21-count Double Horse rose from 192.2 million on Monday to 230 million at the weekend. The trend of leading fine cloth and group yarn is similar, with the weekend rising by more than 10% compared to the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>In terms of rice and grain, due to rare arrivals caused by rainy weather, the production price was reported to be rising. The quantity sold off by the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee could not meet the needs of the market, making it a commodity with a more rapid price increase in the middle of the week. For example, in the Taipei market, white japonica rice rose from 5.45 million per shi at the beginning of the week to 5.9 million on Thursday. The off-market asking price once broke the 6 million mark. By Friday, the weather turned fine, and more goods arrived from other ports, and the price began to fall slightly from the peak. At the weekend, the price of Wuxi rice was reported to be rising, and the price moved towards the peak again. Both the northern and southern markets broke the 6 million mark.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains, wheat, and oil, etc., were stable and in demand. Flour was in strong demand in the north, and the market price rose. For example, No. 1 Bingchuan flour rose from 1.78 million at the beginning of the week to 2.16 million at the weekend.</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap and matches showed slight increases and decreases, and the trend was relatively stable.</p>
<p>As for chemicals, metals, etc., although there were some rises and falls, because the original price has already been high, there has been no new price emergence.</p>
<p>The wholesale price index by purpose last week is as follows:</p>
<p>The wholesale price index by degree of processing last week is as follows:</p>
<p>The wholesale price index by country of production and sales last week is as follows:</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Trends</p>
<h3>Worries for the Import and Export Trade!</h3>
<p>Although the exchange rate benchmark was raised again by the authorities last week (the 17th), whether the situation for the export industry has improved is still not optimistic.</p>
<p>On the 15th of this month, the pig bristle export industry went to the Central Bank and the Export Management Committee to petition, requesting a temporary suspension of foreign exchange settlement, due to the excessive difference between the exchange rate and the cost. On the 18th, the industry went to the Pissai Hotel on Central Road to hold an emergency meeting and decided to immediately dispatch representatives to the government to state the difficulties and request a change in the export settlement method.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Import and Export Association of this city also held a general meeting of export group members. The conclusion was that the only way to improve the current export situation is to unconditionally open up foreign exchange and implement a trade chain system.</p>
<p>However, according to the persons in charge of the Central Bank and the Export Management Committee, they are constantly trying to promote assistance to the export industry. They also said that opening up foreign exchange is not yet the time, because there are too many constraints. If a fundamental solution is not sought, it will only cause adverse consequences. Therefore, the government has not considered this at present.</p>
<p>In this case, the authorities at present can only continue to adopt a "flexible exchange rate policy," and there is no talk of "opening up foreign exchange." However, if the "flexible exchange market price" is too far from the black market price, it will inevitably affect exports and reduce the government's foreign exchange income. Since the government's foreign exchange income is reduced, it can only be planned on "unnecessary" imported materials, that is, reducing the import of materials that the government deems "unnecessary." The "Circular No. 131" issued by the Central Bank and the Export Management Committee recently is proof of reducing the import of ordinary goods. The "Circular" stipulates that importers must deposit 50% of the foreign exchange amount of the license with the Central Bank at the market price of the day, converted into national currency, until the imported goods arrive.</p>
<p>This regulation is of course a major blow to the import industry. The Import and Export Association of this city received letters and telegrams from the Import and Export Associations of Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and other ports last Thursday, stating that this method of the authorities is sufficient to increase the cost of imported raw materials and greatly affect industrial production, so they unanimously expressed their opposition.</p>
<p>However, in the current situation, opposition is one thing, and whether opposition can take effect is another. A Tianjin dispatch published in a major newspaper in this city said it well, "After the announcement of the new import settlement method, everyone lost confidence in the government, as if the government had automatically declared the exhaustion of foreign exchange and the great devaluation of the legal tender, so most funds turned to gold and banknotes to preserve the value of the currency." Thus, following the southward relocation of textile factories, recently some larger import and export firms have also been relocating to the south, most of which are relocating to Hong Kong. The impact cannot be said to be small.</p>
<p>According to the Export Management Committee's news, the foreign exchange settlement of exports in the first half of this month is less than half of the settlement of exports last month. The southward relocation of import and export firms is all related to foreign exchange. If this matter is not properly resolved, it may form a large-scale southward flight of funds.</p>
<p>Following the "Crisis of National Industry and Commerce" discussed in the previous issue, we must again express our fear for the future of China's import and export trade!</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Credit and Black Market Interest Rates</p>
<p>Although the credit situation in this city last week continued the tight trend since the previous week, it finally eased due to the arrival of funds from the north and the interior. Although national banks often showed a huge deficit due to the sale of materials and tax revenues, the credit situation in the market did not appear as tight as in the previous week because the banks often exchanged bills with commercial banks through interbank deposits or transfers. The fact that the exchange volume of the interbank direct exchange group has decreased is also related to this.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the position within the industry is looser than outside the industry. Although interbank lending among banks and firms is still common, it is not hindered by the abundant supply. The cash supply is also loose due to the large number of arrivals from various places. The cash that banks and firms delivered to the Central Bank at night has been over 1.5 trillion in the past week.</p>
<p>According to financial circles, this round of credit tightening seems to have come to an end. After this week, a looser situation may emerge.</p>
<p>From Monday to Friday last week, the total deficit of national banks was 446.442 billion. If the fixed deposits of commercial banks in the Central Bank during the same period, totaling 251 billion, are excluded, the actual deficit of national banks was as large as 195.442 billion, an increase of more than 200 billion compared to the deficit in the same period last week.</p>
<p>As for the exchange results of banks and firms after the 60th, the total deficit in five days was more than 3.2 trillion, which is similar to the deficit in the same period last week, but the daily deficit seems to be decreasing.</p>
<p>The total deficit of foreign banks from Monday to Friday was 923.8 billion, a decrease of about 410 billion compared to the same period last week.</p>
<p>The black market interest rate last week was generally 33%, and those above 36% were not commonly seen, while those with 31.5% were quite common. The trend of the black market interest rate was from high to low, which is the opposite of the trend from low to high in the previous week. From this, it can also be seen that the tight credit situation has eased slightly. As for the off-exchange interest rate for securities, the highest on Wednesday and Thursday was 44 yuan for the buyers (equivalent to about 50%), and 40 yuan for the sellers (equivalent to 45%). On Friday, both sides dropped by 4 yuan, returning to the original level of Tuesday.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The domestic exchange rate last week, the Guangzhou exchange rate was 80 yuan on Monday, and then decreased to 50 yuan from Tuesday to Friday. The Xiamen exchange rate also decreased to 50 yuan by Tuesday, but continued to rise after Wednesday, and rose to 180 yuan by Friday.</p>
<p>The Chongqing exchange rate remained flat in the five days. The Wuhan exchange rate was 60 yuan on Monday, and decreased to 20 yuan by Wednesday. It rebounded to 50 yuan on Thursday and Friday. The Tianjin exchange rate was 70 yuan on Monday, and increased to 140 yuan on Friday.</p>
<p>Generally, the exchange rate last week took the middle of the week as a turning point. The exchange rate trend decreased at the beginning of the week, indicating that more funds flowed into this city from various places. After the middle of the week, the reverse flow of funds decreased because the credit situation in this city had gradually eased. However, the successive increases in the Tianjin exchange rate are sufficient to prove that the southward flow of funds from the north is still surging, which may be affected by the war.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange benchmark rate last week saw an increase after a long period of stability. The US dollar was increased to 474,000, an increase of 46%. The US-British exchange rate remained unchanged. The British pound was equivalent to 1,422,000 national currency per pound.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong exchange rate was only reported in the newspapers the next day, because the authorities feared stimulating public sentiment. On Monday, 100,000 legal tender was equivalent to 41 cents in Hong Kong dollars. The exchange rate was mixed on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, it was 46 cents. The market price of the Hong Kong dollar was 5.23 Hong Kong dollars on Monday, and then continued to rise to 5.38 Hong Kong dollars on Thursday.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the credit situation was tight, and the opening was low. Yongsheng yarn was only 2,570 yuan. Then, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate had been raised by about 40%, it suddenly rose to 2,715 yuan. Other stocks were stable, and the fluctuations throughout the day were narrow.</p>
<p>The next day, cash from the interior continued to arrive, the credit situation eased, and the external situation turned quiet. All stocks became firm and stable. Yongsheng yarn reached 2,720 yuan. Xinho was 960 yuan. Xinguang closed at 39.5 yuan. Jingfu was 20.5 yuan.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the credit situation had eased, and the external situation was quiet. All stocks were hovering upwards. Yongsheng yarn approached the 3,000 yuan mark. Jingfu and Xinguang each rose by 30 cents and 80 cents. Tongyi and Xinho also rose by 30 to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the national banks collected payments for yarn and sugar, and the deficit reached 1.5 trillion. The credit situation suddenly tightened. Yongsheng yarn declined in a roundabout way and barely stood at 2,800 yuan at closing. All stocks declined.</p>
<p>On Friday, funds from the north flooded in, and the credit tightening was coming to an end. People's minds were at peace. All stocks tended to be bullish. Yongsheng yarn exceeded the 2,900 mark before closing. Xinho was approaching the 1,000 yuan mark. Xinguang was 39.5 yuan. Jingfu was 20.20 yuan. The weekend continued this trend, and most stocks rose slowly.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks entered the market on Monday. Due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, people inevitably looked optimistic. After the opening, Yisha was 4.72 million yuan. Later, under the pressure of tight credit, the selling intentions were strong, and it finally declined, closing at 4.45 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.05 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was 9.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>The trend on Tuesday was stable. Because the Hong Kong exchange rate did not fluctuate much and the credit situation was not so loose, the market did not break away from the consolidation. Yisha and Yinglian, etc., fluctuated very little.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market on Wednesday rose, because the Hong Kong exchange rate fluctuated again, the black market became firm again, the credit situation had eased, people's minds were bullish, and it rose sharply. Yisha soared to 5.17 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.75 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was approaching the 12 million yuan mark, all rising strongly.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it was said that the Hong Kong exchange rate had risen, and the credit situation tightened again, so there were many sales, and the market declined in a roundabout way. Yisha returned to 4.98 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.5 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was 10.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Hong Kong exchange rate decreased, and the price of financial items in the black market rose again. All stocks advanced uniformly. Yisha rose to 5.16 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.6 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was 11 million yuan.</p>
<p>At the weekend, the credit situation eased, and all stocks rose again. In particular, Yisha rose by more than 50% and was the most popular, with a total of 5.41 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Comprehensively Studies Ways to Improve Overseas Remittances. Completely Inaccurate that Overseas Remittances are Decreasing Monthly.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing correspondent on the 23rd] The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to attracting overseas remittances. At present, overseas remittance income is inevitably affected because the foreign exchange market price differs greatly from the black market exchange price. The most effective way to remedy this situation is to have the exchange price follow the black market price. However, doing so will cause the black market exchange price to continue to rise, which will drastically stimulate commodity prices and affect the lives of all citizens. Therefore, we have not dared to implement this hastily. The Ministry of Finance is currently doing its best to provide convenience to overseas Chinese and their families in terms of procedures and is urging the handling banks to improve as much as possible. For example, increasing the number of overseas remittance agencies in areas with many overseas Chinese, simplifying the procedures for remittances and withdrawals, pre-storing funds for paying overseas remittances in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places in the country, and delivering remittances to addresses have all achieved good results. As for how to increase overseas remittance income, protect the interests of overseas Chinese, increase the country's foreign exchange sources, and improve overseas remittance methods while also taking into account the principle of domestic price stability and economic stability, the Ministry of Finance is conducting a comprehensive study. The accurate statistics for overseas remittances in March and April of this year have not yet been finalized because the reports from the handling banks have not yet been submitted. The statement in the report that overseas remittance income has been decreasing monthly is completely inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Cherishing Others' Hunger and Drowning, Treasuring Every Minute and Second: Hunan University Faculty Council Urges Students to Return to Classes, Listing Four Points of Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Changsha, 23rd dispatch] After some students at Hunan University opposed the strike, a majority of students had returned to classes by the 22nd. The Faculty Council issued a public notice to all students, strongly urging them to prioritize their studies and return to classes immediately, stating: (1) For self-funded and partially-funded students, the university has advanced over 300 million yuan for the second half of May's food expenses amidst great difficulties, and efforts can also be made regarding scholarships. There is currently no risk of starvation, so there is no need to strike. (2) There is even less concern about starvation for publicly-funded students. If the reason for striking is to fight for discounted rice, the reality is the opposite, because after obtaining discounted rice, funds will only be distributed based on the discounted price, which would be counterproductive. (3) Many people are currently under pressure from the cost of living. Students should cherish others' hunger and drowning, treasure every minute and second, and concentrate on their studies. (4) If the marches and demonstrations across the river are exploited by malicious individuals, leading to accidents, regret will be futile, which is not something wise people would want."</p>

<h3>National Education Statistics for the 35th Academic Year: Over 290,000 Schools, Over 4 Million Graduates</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd dispatch] The following are the statistics for the first semester of the 35th academic year for national education (national schools and primary schools) across the country, according to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Education:</p>
<p>(1) Number of schools: 290,617, including 34,448 central national schools, 234,881 national schools, 19,987 primary schools, and 1,301 kindergartens.</p>
<p>(2) Number of classes: 667,657, including 183,757 in central national schools, 430,496 in national schools, 60,037 in primary schools, and 3,367 in kindergartens.</p>
<p>(3) Number of children: 23,813,705 (17,530,228 boys, 6,283,477 girls), including 7,061,058 in central national schools, 14,201,460 in national schools, 2,420,974 in primary schools, and 130,213 in kindergartens.</p>
<p>(4) Number of graduates: 4,687,411 (3,544,567 boys, 342,844 girls), including 1,528,399 from central national schools, 2,592,669 from national schools, 51,228 from primary schools, and 54,225 from kindergartens.</p>
<p>(5) Number of teachers and staff: 880,555, including 277,124 in central national schools, 508,4414 in national schools, 92,485 in primary schools, and 2,502 in kindergartens.</p>
<p>(Explanation) (1) These statistics are based on the national education reports for the 35th academic year submitted by the provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Kang, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Liaoning, Andong, Liaobei, Jilin, Rehe, Chahar, Ning, Xinjiang, Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and Qing. Hubei and Sui were compiled based on materials from the 34th academic year due to non-reporting. Songjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, Xing'an, Dalian, and Harbin were not included due to incomplete takeover. National primary schools are based on the 46 primary schools and attached early childhood classes in Xikang Yuejun. Overseas Chinese primary schools are based on materials from 353 schools, including the Danang Overseas Chinese Public Shuren Primary School, submitted by consulates in Vietnam, Burma, Siam, Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Perak, Selangor, Java, Sumatra, North Borneo, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Macau, Korea, India, the United States, Canada, Cuba, the Beian Islands, Tahiti, Mauritius, South Africa, and the Northeast. (2) The reason for the decrease in numbers compared to the 34th academic year is that schools in northern Jiangsu were frequently closed due to the roaming of communist bandits. In Jiangxi, some schools were closed due to the reorganization of rural security and protection. Sichuan lacked materials from Chengdu and other county-level cities, as well as county and municipal normal school-affiliated primary schools. Shanxi only had materials from 13 counties and cities, including Taiyuan and Yuci. Rehe only had materials from 7 counties, including Chengde and Pingquan. Guizhou misunderstood the method of reorganizing national schools, and some schools were closed, thus reducing various figures.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Education Society Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Current Educational Issues; Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Ouyuan Huai, Liao Shicheng, and Others Attended</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Education Society held its first members' meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the editorial department of the Zhonghua Book Company on Macau Road to discuss current educational issues. Over sixty members attended, including Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Ouyuan Huai, Shu Xincheng, Liao Shicheng, Du Zuozhou, Li Ximou, Shen Yizhen, Chuantongxian, Xie Xunchu, Wang Yukai, Dong Renjian, Tai Shuangqiu, Yuan Zhe, Mo Zhongyi, Sun Daoyuan, Lu Cunhe, and Huang Jingsi. Shu Xincheng and Liao Shicheng co-chaired the meeting, reporting on the significance of the meeting and the society's affairs. The revised charter was then passed. Subsequently, discussions began on three major current educational issues: (1) The mutual influence of education and society; (2) The educational policies urgently needed in China; and (3) The self-cultivation of educators. Zhang Yi, Tai Shuangqiu, and others then elaborated on the original discussion outline.</p>
<p>Zhang You-san's Proposal</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's proposed topic for discussion was the outline of the mutual influence of education and society, divided into theoretical and practical parts. The former explained the relative significance of society and education and broadly discussed the mutual influence of society and education in China since the implementation of the new school system. The latter provided detailed explanations on: (1) the changing Chinese society, (2) a cross-section of the current stage of Chinese society, (3) hovering on the edge of progress, (4) the impact on education, and (5) the contribution of education. In particular, the section on "the contribution of education" was very detailed in listing the bright and dark sides resulting from the implementation of the new education system. Members then engaged in a lively discussion, generally believing that the mismatch between current society and education is a remnant phenomenon of the scholar-official and education system. If no efforts are made to stop and improve this situation, the harm will intensify over time. A consensus emerged that it is necessary to increase production education and vocational education. It is especially hoped that the education administrative authorities will open up educational avenues and that education workers should form public opinion to urge the authorities to pay attention. Tai Shuangqiu discussed the new education policy in detail from six aspects: consolidating the foundation, broadening learning, practical application, public funding, salaries, and talent cultivation, as a good way for the government to win people's hearts, stabilize society, improve people's livelihoods, and consolidate constitutional governance.</p>
<p>Du Zuozhou's Suggestions</p>
<p>Finally, Du Zuozhou provided specific educational policies: (1) Central and local education administration should adopt a system of equal rights in the future; (2) Implement the provisions of Articles 159, 160, and 264 of the Constitution; (3) Political parties should withdraw from schools; (4) Respect teachers' rights and promote professor-led university governance; (5) Education administrative personnel should strive for professionalism and prevent politicians and bureaucrats from participating in education administration. The implementation methods are: (A) Educational legislative bodies, such as educational councils, should be established in educational administrative institutions at all levels; (B) Basic education should focus on civic training and production training; (C) Secondary schools should adopt a differentiated approach, focusing on various vocational training, and ordinary high schools should be divided into arts and sciences groups; University education halls should focus on the principle of selecting the best and improving standards. Excellent students from poor families should receive full public funding. As the time was too late, the issues could not be discussed in detail. The meeting decided to convene another meeting to discuss each topic specifically, so that a conclusion could be reached and submitted to the government for reference and adoption. After visiting the Zhonghua Book Company's library and editorial department, and screening children's educational films, the meeting adjourned at nearly 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Adopting a Self-Study System to Broaden the Path to Education</h3>
<p>Tai Shuangqiu's Suggestions to the Government</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] Educator Tai Shuangqiu recently listed six points regarding the educational policies urgently needed in China, providing them to the new government after its establishment as a reference for governance. Among them, the policy of broadening learning is to open up avenues for education. He stated: "Affirm the principle that 'receiving education does not necessarily mean attending school.' Outside of the existing school system, establish a 'self-study system' to broaden the path to education so that the children of farmers, workers, and merchants do not have to leave their economic activities, and young people in employment do not have to leave their jobs, but can still study and graduate under the supervision and assessment of government offices." He also stipulated the following key points for the implementation of the "self-study system":</p>
<p>(1) Students register with the local government office or school, reporting the major they are studying or the stage of education they wish to complete. (2) The government or school establishes a guidance department to guide students in self-study. (3) The guidance department of the government office or school should guide students on what curriculum to follow, and procure the necessary books and stationery on their behalf. (4) Libraries, science museums, and other institutions in all public and private schools and educational organizations should be open to the public, and large cities should establish science museums, libraries, and other institutions. (5) Establish more radio broadcasting stations and widely set up receiving stations. University professors give lectures, experts broadcast publicly, and aerial teaching is conducted regularly. (6) Establish mobile education teams, utilizing surplus teachers to provide mobile teaching. (7) Establish "educational guidance stations," hire experts or utilize surplus teachers, set a specific time, and hold public lectures and science demonstrations in fixed locations, allowing people to attend and observe without charge. (8) Regularly hold examinations for a certain title or several types of academic programs, and grant credits to those who pass. (9) If the work students are engaged in is of the same nature as the major they are studying (such as a current primary school principal studying education), the performance of the work shall be assessed and credits awarded accordingly. (10) If a student is pursuing a certain academic degree and part of the practical work requires research in school, the government office or school may stipulate in the curriculum that research in school is required upon reaching a certain level, the length of the research period depending on the nature of the major. (11) Diplomas will be awarded when the academic program and credits earned meet the requirements, and there is no need to limit the number of years of study. (12) Students with excellent self-study results may be awarded scholarships or assisted with further education after graduation. (13) Current school students who must suspend their studies due to economic difficulties or other reasons may complete their studies in accordance with these implementation measures.</p>

In the second quarter, Lin Zhuguang came on the court for the Filipino team, and the reporter team took the opportunity to infiltrate, bringing the score closer, but the first half still ended with the reporter team trailing behind with a score of sixteen to twenty-four.</p>
<p>After a break, the reporter team's Zhou Jun and Xia Zhiong were accurate with their shots, showing a significant improvement, and even took the lead at one point. However, this was only a fleeting moment, and they fell behind again. The Filipino team's Qiu Qinghai was disqualified due to five fouls, and Liu Xudong replaced him. At the end of the third quarter, the reporter team was losing by two and a half points with a score of thirty-three to thirty-eight. In the last quarter, both sides showed signs of fatigue, but Li Antai continued to score repeatedly. The reporter team lacked the strength to reverse the downward trend, and ultimately suffered defeat with a score of forty-five to fifty-three at the end of the game.</p>

<h3>The Post-War Soviet Chemical Industry</h3>
<p>— Xie Tianbiao</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's fourth five-year plan, from 1946 to 1950, is now entering its third year. It stipulates that after the completion of this five-year plan, the general industrial level should be increased by 50% compared to pre-war levels, and the chemical industry is, of course, no exception.</p>
<p>The objectives of the fourth five-year plan in the chemical industry mainly include two aspects: (1) to increase the production of general chemical products to cooperate with the progress of other industries; and (2) to achieve military self-sufficiency and national defense security.</p>
<p>Since 1946, in addition to actively repairing and expanding the old chemical plants that suffered from war damage, the Soviet government has also newly established many basic chemical plants, such as factories for acids, alkalis, and fertilizers. It is hoped that after the completion of these new factories, the manufacturing and self-sufficiency of consumer goods for people's livelihood will gradually expand. At the same time, the Soviet Union does not import machinery, raw materials, and consumer goods from the United States due to political differences. This is precisely because the finished products of these items are lacking in the Soviet Union, and the abnormal shortage of manpower, fuel, electricity, and building materials after the war makes the progress of the fourth five-year plan difficult. In order to overcome the difficulties, the Soviet government uses the inherent advantages of the industry in the occupied areas of Central Europe to supplement the lack of its domestic nutrition.</p>
<p>During the war, the Soviet government made every effort to promote the increased production of various chemicals such as synthetic ammonia, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphate fertilizer, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, calcium carbide, calcium phosphide, paint, and plastics. After the war, in addition to continuing to increase the production of the above-mentioned basic chemicals, the Soviet Union also plans to increase the production of synthetic gasoline, rubber, plastics, wine, oil refining by-products from coal tar, and natural gas. In addition, aniline dyes and medical drugs are also manufactured in large quantities.</p>
<p>Chemical Fertilizers</p>
<p>Increasing fertilizer production is one of the main goals of this five-year plan. It is estimated that in 1950, phosphate fertilizer production should be one time of the pre-war output, nitrogen fertilizer should be 0.8 times, and potassium fertilizer should be 0.3 times. In total, the planned total output of these three fertilizers in 1950 should be 5.4 million tons, of which phosphate fertilizer accounts for 4 million tons. The investment in fertilizer manufacturing in this five-year plan accounts for half of the total investment in the chemical industry, which shows its importance.</p>
<p>During this war, the Soviet Union's domestic industry suffered enormous losses from the war. According to estimates, the machinery for manufacturing light products lost nearly 50%, sulfuric acid equipment lost 77%, soda ash lost 83%, and pigments lost 88%. However, the Soviet government had already tried its best to move the near-western chemical equipment to the Ural and Moscow regions during the war so that the finished products were close to the market. The reason for this at the time was to use the manufactured fertilizers to apply to the agricultural areas in the region so that agricultural products such as cotton, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and oak trees can increase production. As a result of the application of fertilizers, agricultural products in 1946 had increased by 52% compared to 1945, and the production of agricultural products in 1947 can be expected to be even better than the previous year.</p>
<p>Synthetic Gasoline and Synthetic Rubber</p>
<p>This five-year plan intends to increase the production of synthetic gasoline, with a planned annual output of 900,000 tons. The reason is that although the Soviet Union is the second-largest oil producer in the world, due to the war, the oil fields in Maikop and Grozny have been frequently destroyed, and the Baku oil field, which is said to supply 70% of the country, was also automatically destroyed. The production of oil fields in the Volga and Ural regions has not been ideal, so increasing the production of synthetic gasoline is still necessary.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that there is existing equipment, talent, raw materials, and bituminous coal in the occupied areas, and the scarcity of coal in the country, and the difficulty of moving synthetic machinery, it was decided to resume work and production on the spot. In addition, the Donets coal and iron production area, which was severely damaged during the war, was restored (the Donets Basin is not only the only coal production center in the Soviet Union, but also has about 50% to 60% of the country's iron ore, about 20% of the country's pig iron and aluminum, and 25% of the country's electricity and other resources, so the restoration of this area is closely related to the chemical industry's revival in the entire Soviet Union).</p>
<p>The planned increase in the production of synthetic rubber in the Soviet Union will be one time of the previous plan, which is 38% of the total output of synthetic rubber in the world. The production of synthetic rubber in the Soviet Union began in 1928. At that time, due to the sharp increase in demand during the war, in addition to converting potatoes into alcohol as raw material for synthetic rubber, the production was actively expanded, and raw materials were also extracted from natural rubber trees.</p>
<p>In 1931, the Soviet government had established four synthetic rubber factories. After the completion of the second five-year plan, another four factories were built. During the implementation of the third five-year plan, there were already 18 synthetic rubber factories in operation and under construction when the war broke out. In 1938, it was estimated that more than 100,000 tons of synthetic rubber were produced annually by the polymerization of butadiene with metallic sodium. This method is based on the improved method of Lebedev. Butadiene is first produced from alcohol. In 1939, it was estimated that 2.8 tons of alcohol were needed to produce one ton of butadiene, which is twice as much as the amount required to produce butadiene from alcohol in 1928!</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the production of alcohol from food grains affects food supplies, the Soviet Union has now switched to using acetylene, natural gas, and petroleum as raw materials. After this, the per capita consumption of rubber by the Soviet people is only 0.37 pounds, which is far from the 9.9 pounds consumed by each person in the United States at the same time. It can be seen that the Soviet Union still needs to work harder to increase rubber production compared to the United States!</p>
<p>Artificial Fiber</p>
<p>In the previous five-year plans of the Soviet Union before the war, emphasis was placed on the production of natural fibers. The artificial fiber industry is a new emerging industry after the war. It is estimated that the planned output in 1950 will be four to five times that of the pre-war fiber industry. With 600 million acres of forests in the Soviet Union, there is no need to worry about the raw materials for artificial fiber manufacturing. In addition, bark and branches can also be used as raw materials for alcohol, acetone, sulfuric acid derivatives, rosin, and turpentine.</p>
<p>Natural Gas</p>
<p>There are more than 200 known natural gas reserves in the Soviet Union. Due to the urgent need for fuel during the war, exploration was accelerated. In 1944, two lines of natural gas pipelines, 105 miles long, from Buguruslan to the Karpachev factory were completed. Recently, the completion of the pipeline from the Saratov gas field to Moscow is also 530 miles long. Others under design include a 300-mile gas pipeline from Dahava in western Ukraine to Kyiv, and a 136-mile gas pipeline from Estonia to Leningrad, which is urgently awaiting burial. If it can be completed, it will also be a major construction project.</p>
<p>Most of the natural gas in the Soviet Union is obtained from the coal in the coal tar fields. This method of producing natural gas can save the cost of coal transportation and ash accumulation. The method is to mix hot air with oxygen and press it into the tunnels to obtain natural gas.</p>
<p>Plastics and Oils</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's plastics industry received special attention during the war. In 1947, there were already 18 plastic factories in Ukraine alone. In 1950, the production of dyes and plastics could increase by 30% compared to pre-war levels, with an output of 43,000 tons.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the oil industry. There are often improvements and reports from agricultural experiment fields in various places on the planting and production of sesame and sunflowers, and there has been significant progress. Most of the oil refined from sunflowers is hardened and used to make margarine and soap. In 1950, it could reach an annual production of 870,000 tons of soap. Compared to 1940, the annual production of soap was only 800,000 tons, which is an improvement. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Art of Alchemy</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>At the Federal Atomic Energy Research Institute in Oak Ridge (Tennessee), the dream of ancient alchemists has recently been realized - artificial gold has been made. Atomic piles are used as the Philosopher's Stone. After a series of reactions, 24-karat pure gold is produced (note: karat does not indicate weight but purity).</p>
<p>However, the strangest characteristic of artificial gold is that no matter how well it is preserved, it will transform into other elements in less than a week. Because of this, "radioactive gold" has increased its value because it has made a great contribution to medicine, and sixty-one patients have been fortunate enough to be cured by it.</p>
<p>However, making artificial gold is not a shortcut to getting rich, because the raw material is even more precious platinum. However, its significance is vast, showing the omnipotence of science, and also establishing the important position of isotopes.</p>
<p>Although there are only ninety-six elements in the periodic table today, the discovery of isotopes has exceeded seven hundred. The same elements have the same chemical properties but different physical properties. Its development has contributed to the invention of the atomic bomb and has also helped the success of artificial gold. We can safely handle uranium 238, but uranium 235 can explode. It can be seen that some isotopes are stable, while others change in an instant, even the iron or sulfur we are most familiar with.</p>
<p>If seven or eight hundred isotopes are arranged in a table, it will look very complicated, but if we study it carefully, we can see that these ever-changing elements are actually only related to two factors: one is the positively charged proton (or positron) discovered in 1886; and the other is the completely electrically neutral neutron, whose properties were not fully discovered until 1932. The entire universe is composed of these two "particles."</p>
<p>As a result, the artificial isotope has also been successful, because the number of protons affects the position of the element in the periodic table and its properties (chemical and physical properties). For example, hydrogen is one proton, helium has two protons, and so on up to the most recently discovered element 96 - curium. Not only that, but the sum of the number of protons and neutrons determines the type of isotope.</p>
<p>To prove this principle, we can do a simple demonstration: Suppose you have a silver coin hidden in your pocket and work next to a cyclotron. After a while, a small amount of cadmium will be found in the silver coin, which is a metal that was not added to the silver coin in the mint. The fact is this: The silver in the coin is Ag107 - including forty-seven protons and sixty neutrons; after receiving a neutron released by the cyclotron, it becomes the isotope Ag108, which is a radioactive element that emits an electron (Beta ray), turning a neutron in the element into a proton, thus producing one - Ag108, which has one more proton than Ag107.</p>
<p>The progress of science lies only in being able to control the speed of radioactivity and not let it increase and decrease on its own over tens of thousands of years. Although radioactivity remains the same, the atomic impact device shortens the experiment time, allowing scientists to realize facts that they thought were impossible to study.</p>
<p>By applying these principles, new elements have been embodied, and artificial gold has also been successful. The question only lies in how scientists today will use existing achievements to make some practical contributions?</p>
<h3>You Can Learn While You Sleep</h3>
<p>— Tong Gao</p>
<p>Learning some things is painful, like languages, multiplication tables, Morse code, etc. Now there is hope that this pain can be relieved. There is a machine that can teach you while you sleep. It was invented by Max Sherover, President of the Lingua-Phone Institute of America.</p>
<p>This machine is not absurd. In fact, after two years of testing at the University of North Carolina, psychologists there declared that this sleep-learning program was successful.</p>
<p>Sherover's machine is actually a combination of a phonograph, a record player, and a pillow microphone. Psychologist Charles R. Elliott selected fifteen unrelated words and recorded their sounds on a disc.</p>
<p>The fifteen words were: boy, egg, speak, run, art, not, Mr., foot, bag, row, ice, out, age, box, eat. Professor Elliott selected forty students with normal hearing and began his sleep teaching.</p>
<p>In each test, twenty students were allowed to sleep undisturbed, while the other twenty students had a microphone placed under their pillow after falling asleep. The microphone was then connected to the record player, which played the above words at regular intervals, repeating them thirty times in total. The professor used an electroencephalograph to prove that they were indeed asleep. The electroencephalograph is an instrument that records brain waves. The brain waves of a sleeping person are different from those of an awake person.</p>
<p>After three hours of sound sleep, all forty students were awakened, and a list of these words was given to them to read for a while. Then, they were asked to silently recite the fifteen words as much as possible. As a result, the twenty students who had received Sherover's sleep teaching quickly recited the words. As for the twenty students who slept undisturbed, they showed very poor performance.</p>
<h3>Islands of the Pacific</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>The islands of the Pacific Ocean are numerous, and their distribution is extremely wide. Some of the smaller ones are merely dots on the map, identified only by a name, while the majority are largely unnamed islands with only a small number of inhabitants. Even in the Philippines, there are more than seven thousand islands. Many other areas are similar. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that the Pacific contains "countless" islands. Most of these islands are small and difficult to find. However, there are also quite a few large islands, even continental in size. For example, New Guinea is the second largest island in the world after Greenland, with an area of 330,000 square miles, approximately 25 times the size of Taiwan and 23 times the size of Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of islands in the Pacific Ocean, as a single atoll is often composed of more than a dozen small islands. According to recent expert surveys, there are 2,650 major islands in the Pacific, with countless minor islands. The Tuamotu Group is an example of such a group of small islands. The local language meaning is "A Cloud of Islands," which vividly describes their abundance. The larger islands number about eighty, while the smaller ones are too numerous to count. The total area of all the islands, however, is only 330 square miles. There is no satisfactory way to classify the island groups of the Pacific. Regardless of the principle used, such as political divisions, climatic differences, distribution of flora and fauna, or geological structure, there are always drawbacks. The current general groupings are quite勉强 (forced). A reasonable classification should be based on geological history and animal life, and such research would be very interesting.</p>
<p>However, the most common method of grouping is based on the distribution of indigenous peoples since historical times. The many islands located east of the Philippines and north of New Guinea are inhabited by short, dark-skinned people and are collectively known as Micronesia. The islands inhabited by black people are known as Melanesia, including New Guinea and extending east to the Fiji Islands. In the central Pacific, where there are the most islands and the widest distribution, it is called Polynesia. The inhabitants have yellow-brown skin and beautiful features and are renowned navigators. Their distribution stretches from New Zealand in the south to the Hawaiian Islands in the north, and east to Easter Island, covering the widest area.</p>
<p>In addition, in the western Pacific, along the Asian continent, there are also many islands, including Hainan Island and Taiwan Island of China, the Ryukyu Islands, and further north to the Japanese archipelago, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands. In the northeastern Pacific, the most important islands are the Aleutian Islands, which connect to the Alaskan Peninsula. Furthermore, far away in the eastern Pacific, straddling the equator north and south, are the Galapagos Islands, about 500 miles from Ecuador (also known as the Equatorial Nation).</p>
<p>In the southwestern Pacific, there are several large islands, namely Borneo in the southern Philippines, and further south, Java and Sumatra, along with many islands belonging to the Dutch East Indies. These islands have all had a glorious history in the development of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Finally, Oceania refers to the ocean area and the islands of the southwestern Pacific, including Australia, the largest island or the smallest continent in the world.</p>

<h3>On Sucking Boils</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Although the doctrines of the Legalists are cruel and ungracious, they are somewhat in accordance with the facts. The Chinese call a penetrating and incisive statement cruel because it is too unforgiving. The "Preparation Within" chapter says:</p>
<p>"A good doctor sucks the wounds of others and drinks their blood, not out of kinship, but for profit; therefore, a cartwright hopes for the wealth and nobility of others, and a coffin maker hopes for the early death of others. It is not that the cartwright is benevolent and the coffin maker is a thief; but if people are not noble, carts will not sell; if people do not die, coffins will not be bought: the feelings are not hatred of people, but the profit lies in the death of people."</p>
<p>Isn't this a penetrating statement? Mozi also said: "Are arrow makers not more benevolent than armor makers? Arrow makers only fear not hurting people, while armor makers only fear hurting people, so the art must not be carefully chosen." The meaning is similar, and the responsibility is attributed to the choice of art, but in fact, this statement does not hold. If everyone chooses to be an armor maker and not an arrow maker, does it mean that no one will care when people die? By this reasoning, pharmacies, doctors, and even sanitation facilities are all unnecessary. Therefore, Han Fei's statement is more reasonable.</p>
<p>If so, it is in great conflict with Kropotkin's Mutual Aid. Kropotkin believes that the progress and existence of society depend on human mutual aid; there is no view of utility in it; however, if we think carefully, we also know that the purpose of mutual aid is mutual benefit, which is also what Mozi called universal love. Ants and aphids, one fulfilling the responsibility of protection, and the other fulfilling the responsibility of providing nectar for others to suck, isn't that the case? Therefore, mutual benefit is not to be criticized. If you want everyone to devote themselves to feeding hungry tigers and fulfilling the great vow of a Bodhisattva, that is the highest ideal of saviors and sages, but to seek it from ordinary people is simply to see that it cannot be done.</p>
<p>A society where everyone benefits each other and achieves equilibrium is a world of peace. I think the character for peace, "平," can be interpreted in this way by its literal meaning. When things are not balanced, they make a sound, which has been the case since ancient times, and even more so today. Therefore, Western political philosophy is Give and Take, and the most taboo is killing the chicken to get the egg. This is something that everyone easily understands, but unfortunately, they know it but do not do it, which makes the world forever in turmoil. Whether humanity is foolish or wise, it is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>I think the reason is nothing more than planning for oneself, and forgetting that planning for others is planning for oneself. The Confucian tradition is to respect the ruler and maintain the existing social order, which is also a kind of selfishness because only in this way can one have a stable life and rise to prominence. Maintaining the entire social order is certainly not bad, but 耐其末流 (in the end) they only remember their own rise to prominence and forget society. Moreover, the gentry are the true owners of Chinese sovereignty, and their realistic position makes them shortsighted, thinking that "in today's world, who but me can do it!" Thus, enjoying and exploiting are taken for granted, and bestowing benefits on the people is seen as a sacrifice and compassion. We see that the gentry in the late Ming Dynasty were all "tigers wearing hats" as described in the Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Dong Qichang was a learned and sensible man, and even became a Grand Secretary of the Inner Cabinet, yet he dared to kidnap men and seize women, arousing popular resistance, and even destroying houses and burning homes. His offense to public anger can be seen. Notes record that Fang Bao, a master of the Tongcheng School in the Qing Dynasty, was also somewhat like this. It seems that writing is one thing, and behavior is another, which cannot but make people deeply sigh.</p>
<p>Originally, Confucius also aimed to gain the ruler's position, intending to realize his ideals, so he did not hesitate to run into walls in various countries. Unexpectedly, what followed was a cheap Confucian who "straightened his clothes and straightened his face," and whose development must be "preserving his whole body and protecting his wife and children." If he goes further, he will be a donkey-like barking dog. Choosing means without regard to the end has already become the tradition of scholars. Try to count the rulers of each dynasty, either combined with relatives of the emperor or colluded with eunuchs. As far as the disaster of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the pure current of the scholar-gentlemen, the final dependent on the 賽憲 (bestowing power), was not it the relative of the emperor? Recent studies by Chen Yinque show that the factional struggles in the Tang Dynasty were the struggles of the eunuch factions. Even virtuous people like Li Wenrao could not avoid this; as for Li Hongzhang and Yuan Shikai in the Qing Dynasty, and the 鬧然 (rambunctious) in the Ming Dynasty, they need not be discussed; sometimes, outside of relatives and eunuchs, they even collude with enemies and foreign races, or they are veterans of five dynasties, shameless. Which one is not the achievement of the Confucian elders? From this point of view, the shamelessness of officials is the shame of the country, and it is true at all times and in all places.</p>
<p>If ritual is lost, seek it in the countryside. In fact, Chinese farmers are not bad, and even if they are bad, they are forced by the scholar-officials and gentry. As the saying goes, officials force the people to rebel, which is still sought from the迹象 (signs). Officials and gentry are the models of the people, that is, the life purpose of most people. Those above like something, those below will like it even more. Bad role models have long been established in the atmosphere, so how can we blame the villagers for stealing chickens and scolding dogs, adultery, evil, and theft? Recently, I heard someone say that China should not run mass education. All those who do bad things are literate. Although the words are extreme, there is a reason! If the scholars do not change their style of sucking boils and licking hemorrhoids, or if mass education is run for a few more decades, it is not known whether the nation will eventually fall.</p>
<h3>Three Dishes to Accompany Wine</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Oil-fried shrimp is a good dish to accompany wine. It is available in all seasons, but this thing also has its season. In early summer—around May—when eating fried shrimp, there is a bit of red in the head, about the size of a red bean, peeking out of the shell. This is shrimp fat, which is the most delicious, with the beautiful name of Zhuzhu Cherry. It is now in season, and old foodies must know it.</p>
<p>When the peach blossoms bloom in spring, a kind of crow flies here, and it leaves in a few days. It is also one of the seasonal birds. It has a long beak, colorful feathers, and a short tail, and is called the Peach Blossom Chicken, also known as the Wheat Pecker. Its head is very good. It is fried crispy in heavy oil, cooked with sugar and vinegar, and is extremely delicious with wine. Or use ten birds with half a catty of good leg meat, stewed with old wine, soy sauce, and spices, and simmered in a 　crock, then you don't have to ask for anything else for days of drinking.</p>
<p>Crab is the most delicious thing. I think drunken crab is best eaten 　with wine. The method is to place peppercorns and salt in the navel of the crab, use the best old wine and vinegar, add a little sugar, tie the crab tightly, place it in a jar, and store it in a dark place. It can be opened and eaten soon. Each time you eat it, you must not use a light, as the crab will become sandy if you use a light. This has been tested and is always effective. There is a song about making drunken crabs, which I have recorded below:</p>
<p>Twenty round navel crabs, no pointy ones, half a catty of good vinegar, half a catty of salt, four taels of sugar, 　a catty and a half of wine, eat until the second month of next year.</p>
<p>All delicious foods have their season. For example, 　pomfret and yellow fresh fish are in early summer, hairtail is in early spring, chicken and duck are available all year round, but chicken is best in spring and duck is best in autumn, the so-called spring chicken and August duck (eighth month of the lunar calendar).</p>
<h3>The Poet Yang Yunshi</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>The poet Yang Yunshi participated in General Wu Peifu's military staff as a famous son of an official, serving as secretary general, and became famous throughout the country. He claimed to be Yang Qi of Jiangdong, Yunshi was his courtesy name, with the alternative name Yewang and the formal name Chaoqing. He was from Changshu, a successful candidate in the Nanyuan examination of the Qing Guangxu Renyin year, and an official in the Ministry of Posts and Communications, as well as the Consul-General in Singapore. His father was Yang Chongyi, the Left Censor-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Yunshi first married a granddaughter of Li Hongzhang, and then married a Ms. Xu, known as Mrs. Xiake. Xu then died, and Yunshi was about to follow 　General on an expedition. The day after Xu's funeral, he abandoned his family and followed, hence the line "Pitifully, on the thirteenth night of September, the first night of death and separation," which was widely recited for a time. In his later years, he was attached to Di Meinan, adding fragrance to his writing with a beauty by his side, not lonely at all. His "Collection of Poems from the Jiangshan Wanli Tower" has many songs in the style of Changqing, and the five-character poems must imitate Du Shaoling, with overflowing talent, unable to stop writing. During the Dingchou Incident (1937), he fled to Hong Kong. His tragic songs were generous, and people called them poetic history. He was once summoned to Sichuan because rumors were circulating that General Wu would come out of seclusion. Yunshi strongly stated that General Wu would never recognize the traitors as his fathers. When General Wu was forced to commit suicide, Yunshi composed poems to mourn him, with words of blood and tears, and later died in Hong Kong. Yunshi served General Wu with utmost sincerity and integrity. I once saw Yunshi in a teahouse talking about Wu, always referring to him as "Lord" instead of by name, and his attitude was sincere and solemn, as if referring to a monarch and father. Wu looked at him with favor, and the two were as happy as fish and water in their lives.</p>
<p>Yunshi once climbed the Liaodong city in heavy snow after drinking wine, composing twelve poems, with weighty words, tragic and dripping, still his remaining matter. Here are four of them: "The horses are circling, the bows are bent, the alfalfa is fat, the golden soup is great for starting a war; the snowflakes are as white as the elm leaves on the mountain, not shining on the golden cup but shining on the iron armor." "The Central Plains are being chased, and the whole country is empty, the border soldiers are exhausted and re-bending their bows. How many yellow-faced white bones are there? All are in the setting sun of Yingzhou." "The affair of the nine princes gathering is in vain, and the three points can still calm the flames of war; the river does not limit the competition of the south wind, and the cuckoo cries outside the Jin Bridge." 　"Layered 　beautiful wine, drink a thousand cups, the sun sets, and clear songs want to shake the chest, drunk, not forgetting the atmosphere of the customs, the jade person helps to see Lulong." The last hero and heroine are both there, just like Gong Ding'an's poem, "For fear that Liu Lang's heroic spirit will 　, roll up the curtains and wash your face to the Yellow River."</p>
<p>In his days in the countryside, Yunshi first lived in Xuyuan Garden, and then lived in Jiuwanwei. Plum blossoms were planted all over the hall, with no other trees. On New Year's Day, the hall was always hung with a large "福" (fortune) character written by Empress Dowager Cixi, for offering at the incense table,盛陳設 (grandly arranged), even after the Republic of China, which was inevitable with the habits of a remnant of the Qing Dynasty. However, his person was particularly emotional, truly the true color of a poet. His son, Qianqing, was also known in the art world for his refinement and elegance. Thus, Yunshi was truly the son of a famous father and the father of a famous son.</p>
<h3>For Three Months, He Did Not Know the Taste of Meat</h3>
<p>— Yushan</p>
<p>"Confucius heard the Shao music, and for three months he did not know the taste of meat." Confucius heard the famous music and would forget the taste of pork for three months, which is really amazing! I don't think it should be explained like this. A New Account of Tales of the World says, "Silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as meat." What is the reason? His answer is, "It is getting closer to nature." In theory, the qin and zither are not as good as the xiao and flute, and the xiao and flute are not as good as singing; because singing is the most natural. So Mei Lanfang's singing is the best. Shao music is silk and bamboo, and in theory, it is not as good as the beauty of singing, but as an exception, it is better than all the songs sung, the so-called "meat sound." After Confucius heard it, he did not want to listen to people's songs. The so-called three months means a long time. The Analects says that Yan Hui did not violate benevolence for three months, which is an example. The ancients referred to three years and three months, etc., mostly as a majority or a long period of time. It can be seen that after Confucius heard the Shao music, he was reluctant to listen to people's songs for a long time. Saying that he forgot about the cold pork that was cut square and square, I'm afraid it's not necessarily true? Otherwise, the butcher shop owner and the music teacher would be at odds, and "passing by the butcher's door and eating heartily" would not be necessary. Just go listen to music.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>A knowing bitter smile often contains more of a knowing than a knowing smile.</p>
<p>If there is still oil in the lamp, the extinguished fire will still light up again.</p>
<p>There is only one person in the world who will never leave you: your own shadow.</p>
<p>Although a trackless tram does not have tracks, it still has its route.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>I have also heard that when the capital city authorities hosted the female representatives, they delivered a novel speech on the spot, saying: "The world situation has been made so bad by men that it must be changed. Women should take the place of men, and we can hope for improvement." I also heard that a certain dean also gave a sympathetic resonance at a banquet, condemning men and praising women. This seems to be a tactful and pleasant remark on a social occasion, but it actually contains a considerable amount of understanding. In all countries around the world, national affairs have always been led by men. Even in Europe and America, where women's rights are open, although they are more free than the old slave-like women in Asia, and women are engaged in society, not limited to the family kitchen, their participation in politics is still a guest position, and military affairs and diplomacy are more like the exclusive rights of men. In general, the male monopoly of "national affairs" and the monopoly of "great power" is indeed a common lament in all directions, which has been the case since ancient times. The results of the monopoly, the distant and trivial ones are not worth listing, only the two world wars in the last thirty years, the mountains of corpses and the seas of blood, the rain of bullets and the smoke of gunpowder, destroying humanity and destroying the universe, are truly "exhausting the bamboo of Nanshan Mountain, writing endless crimes; raising the waves of the East Sea, and not exhausting the flow of evil." A history of human sin can be directly asserted as caused by men, and Womankind has nothing to do with it, does not bear the responsibility, but suffers the most. Therefore, regardless of whether "women replacing men" can be realized, and even more unnecessary to predict the achievements of women replacing men, there is no doubt that men should step down and cede power. (Editor's note: Hilaire Belloc, a famous British writer, also once advocated that wives should organize the cabinet and govern the country.)</p>
<h3>Collected Jottings on Painting Orchids by Yun Jian (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Green Clouds</p>
<p>Someone asked, "What makes a good orchid painting?" Yun Jian said, "Don't worry about making it good at first." The person said, "If one is capable, where should one start with the ancient masters?" Yun Jian said, "Who did the ancients learn from?" The person said, "How does one achieve spirit?" Yun Jian said, "By doing what comes naturally."</p>
<p>Four-Stroke Orchid</p>
<p>One day, Yun Jian was in a state of wooden stillness, deeply savoring the pleasure of wine. A Chong cleaned the inkstone and asked for fine ink. A Yi also came and grabbed my arm, so I smiled and got up to paint this great work.</p>
<p>One stroke more is too much, one stroke less is too little. Only when you use all your strength can you see its spirit.</p>
<p>Wind Orchid</p>
<p>In calligraphy, from the clerical script onwards, there is no finger technique. In dividing strokes, pausing, and flicking, finger technique gradually becomes apparent beyond wrist strength. In the way of orchids, finger technique is often seen, which is appropriate for their posture. This is slightly different from calligraphy.</p>
<p>Side-by-Side Orchids</p>
<p>Two sons, two daughters, one husband, one wife. Xiang Ping's wish is fulfilled, traveling east and west.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>The Yue maiden discussed swordsmanship with Goujian, saying, "I did not learn it from anyone, but suddenly possessed it." This word "suddenly" is wonderful! If one can understand "suddenly" when painting orchids, it is precisely not "suddenly."</p>
<p>Inscribing on Spoon Mustard Greens</p>
<p>Yun asked the layman to finish painting this, and after pondering, I wrote two lines: "I lie slightly drunk, the white sun slanting, for how many years have I watched dragons and snakes on the rivers and seas?" My wife laughed and glared, saying, "That's just a drunkard's talk, what does it have to do with this?" The layman continued to write: "Who pities a petal of spoon mustard greens, originally from the home of a recluse in Jiangdong." She said, "Always the demeanor of a poor scholar." The layman said, "This is precisely what's good, no need to labor over white hair!" Ha ha.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>In the lonely spring lamplight, I hold the brush to paint the weeping, wind-like appearance of Xiang flowers, wanting to send them to someone, but I feel it is better not to send them.</p>
<p>Mountain Orchid</p>
<p>Not yet time to leave the mountain, not yet time to leave the mountain, definitely not leaving the mountain.</p>
<p>Potted Orchid</p>
<p>My youngest daughter, A Yi, who is eight years old, came back from reading and watched me paint orchids. She suddenly said, "Father's paintings are always bad." I said, "They will be good in the future." A Yi said, "Worse and worse!" I said, "Bad is good." A Yi ran away, saying, "Fool!"</p>
<p>Years ago, A Chong said I "didn't resemble" (orchids), and this year A Yi said I was "not good." They are truly a good pair of sisters. When they get married in the future, they must not ask their paralyzed father for paintings.</p>
<p>Orchid and Rock</p>
<p>A guest saw that Yun Jian's inscriptions on his orchid paintings were often self-praising. He unrolled this scroll and said, "Who can compare?" Yun Jian said, "Below Shan Tao, above Wei Shu." The guest did not understand what he meant, and after the guest left, he wrote it down.</p>
<p>Fragrant Orchid and Iris in Bloom</p>
<p>An ancient person said, "Orchids are beauties, Dong (Zhongshu) is a famous scholar." Now that I make them grow together among moss and rocks, sharing the same place, I am like Cao Qiu.</p>
<p>A Clump of Orchids</p>
<p>For a thousand years of excellence, virtue alone is important. I imagine Yu Chi's jade chest is free of old things, and should be as bright and clear as this.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>In the past, when I painted orchid masterpieces at Chen Dongqiao's place, they were highly praised. Looking at them today, they are at best high-ranking in the second tier of those who crossed the river (after the fall of the Jin Dynasty). Yun Jian has this fortune, claiming to be like Wang A Gua's calligraphy in the Sanxi Hall.</p>
<p>Valley Orchid</p>
<p>Traces hidden, name known. Who destroys, who praises? Originally in the mountains, deep in the white clouds. Orchid</p>
<p>One wrong move, the whole game is lost. This one move is not the first move. A failed stroke in painting orchids ruins the entire paper, but this one stroke is precisely the first stroke. Learning the calligraphy of Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi is also like this. One failed stroke jumps out from the paper and stabs directly into the eye. Liu Lingyan said he did not understand Zhang Maoxian (Zhang Hua), truly, I also cannot understand myself.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Intentional or unintentional, resembling orchids or not, forgetting emotions and skill, the joy lies beyond the rules.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>No one cares about my state, nor whether I intend to help or not. Bai Jiao's orchid paintings are just so-so. Mountain Orchid</p>
<p>Mr. Bai Jiao's smell of alcohol is very bad, his orchid paintings are very good.</p>
<p>Mountain Orchid</p>
<p>Since there are no orchid growers in the world, I still plant them in the mountains of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Hold the wrist high, the palm flexible, the fingers alive, the brush has lightness and heaviness, the strength is even!</p>
<p>In the clear morning, grinding a spoonful of ink, spreading the paper and stretching the hair (of the brush), there is naturally the momentum of light troops pursuing and returning.</p>
