<p>〔本報訊〕第七屆全國運動會定今日下午三時在市中心區體育場揚幕，與會選手近二千七百人，參加單位五十餘個，溯自遜清末葉舉行首屆全運以來，已歷三十七年，歷屈各項運動成績，因為省選手之努力參加，新紀錄層兌疊出，在教育與體育整個運動史上具有深鉅之價值。六屆全運會閉慕後，依據規定七屆全運應於廿六年舉行，適值「七七」事變爆發，抗戰軍興，乃告無定期休會，行憲在邇，戡亂方殷，政府猶努力促使七屈全運會於「五五」舉行，意義殊屬深長。尤其令全國人心為之振奮者，各單位選手之赴會參加視前屆為尤熱烈，西康隊遠道步行達九日之久，吉林隊跋涉南征，越匪區而不辭艱險，台省及海外僑胞亦呈現空前之踴躍，此蓋含有劃時代之意義存乎其間。此次大會已柬邀中樞各部會首長，國府委負，政務委員及外賓等，約七十餘人，參加此一空前盛大之全運會。名譽副會長戴傳賢並將代表名譽會長蔣主席蒞會出席，主席特頒之訓詞，甫於今日由火炬接力長跑隊傳達此間，殊足珍視。今日舉行之其他主要節目，如足球，籃球，大會操等亦定於同時舉行，深信大會揭幕後，風艱際會，各選手在運動成績上必克創造全國新紀錄，以副我政府及民眾十餘年來蘊蓄於心坎中之深切期望。大會預定舉行十一天，十五日舉行閉幕典禮。（全運各項節目，可參閱第五，第六，第七，各版）</p>

<p>第七屆全國運動大會舉行於抗戰勝利三年之後，正當憲政開始之時又在世界運動大會之前，參加的單位普及全國各地，東北的選手，固喜久別重逢，台灣的選手，更喜回歸祖國我們撫今思昔，鑑往徵來，深覺本屆全運大會不但具有劃時代的意義，而且分担起世界的任務，不但青年健兒應該一致興奮，而且全國同胞都寄與遠大的期望。</p>
<p>本來一個民族的生存必須德育·智育·體育三者皆有健全的發展，尤其體育更是德·智兩育的基本，必須有了健強的體魄，充沛的精神，然後對於德性·修養·智能·開發乃能左右逢源，日新又新，我們先聖先賢所昭示的智仁勇以及射御兩項，列為六藝的中心，正與此理一貫相通，希望全運大會的健兒們都深切認識這崇高的真諦，在動動場中淬勵奮發，無論在技術上，在道德上都爭取優良的表現，把中華民族的精神帶到世界運動場上，放射出燦爛的光輝，同時把在運動大會上和諧的情感，帶回到各個選手的故鄉使我們全民族的心情得到更親切的交流，更真摯的團結，而且把本屆大會所獲得特殊成績帶回到各個學校和各個地方，鼓舞起愛好運動的風氣，使我們國民體育獲得迎頭趕上的進步，這是中正對於全運大會最熱烈的　望，亦即全會健兒最偉大的成就，祝你們努力，祝你們成功，蔣中正。</p>

<p>〔中央社兩京四日電〕中美關於實施美國援華法案之換文，業經雙方公布，美援物資，即將運華，行政院張院長認為，亟應合併其他性質相同之機關，改設統籌專管機構，負責妥為管理運用，以配合財政經濟政策之改進，經於四日行政院第五十四次會議提出討論，決定設立行政院美援運用委員會，由行政院長主持，設委員十三人，除以各主管部會首長為當然委員外，餘由行政院騁任，並由主任委員指定委員三人，為常務委員，協助主持會務，另設正副秘書長各一人，負責處理事務。聞常務委員，已推定以財政部長，中央銀行總裁，及繆委員雲台擔任，並以繆委員兼任秘書長。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日電〕此間今日透露：由於馬歇爾與我駐美大使顧維鈞交換書函之結果，三億三千八百萬美元之經濟援華計劃已準照聯總結束後之救濟協定之臨時辦法，正式開始執行。中國已於其約定書中表示願遵照美援外立法之規定，與美國簽訂雙邊協定。雙邊協定未簽訂前，關於援華之條件物資種類與處理細則，皆以聯總結束後之救濟方式為準，故中國即可獲得若干基本生活必需品之贈予，如米·麥·藥物·殺蟲劑·棉花·烟草·石油製品·媒炭·與肥料等是。按照聯總結束後之救濟協定，機器零件之補充，不包括在內。約定書曾特別說明復興協助，或貸款形式之援助，尚須將來由協定予以規定。至於農村復興計劃，亦將包括在內。經濟合作局已有進出口銀行整付之款項五千萬美元，全部援華經費則在等候國會之通過撥付中。但國會之撥款援華須在為歐洲復原計劃通過撥款以後，且亦須杜魯門為此正式提出諮請時，始予討論。現約定書之有效期間，僅至七月三日止，屆時如雙邊協定仍未簽定，則援華計劃將被暫行擱置。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕「五四」廿九週年紀念的早晨，記者找到了「五四」運動的領導者胡適之先生。胡先生開頭就和記者肯定的說：『「五四」運動是一個新思潮新文化運動，當時並不是政治運動。』接着胡先生追述當時的情形說：「那時我們覺得要想提倡新文化，新思潮，就必須在非政治的基礎上建立一種新的基礎，所以我們那時的主張是廿年不幹政治，甚至有人主張不談政治。不談政治是不可能的，但我們很多人確實做到二十年不幹政治，我個人就是在五四運動的廿一年後才做外交官的。我們當時極力的避開政治，但是政治却不能但開我們，反之却來逼我們，以致五四運動慢慢成了帶有政治性的運動，各黨派的領導人，都認為這是一種偉大的力量，當時中山先生在給海外同志書中，就曾說到學生力量的偉大，其他共產黨和別的黨派，也都開始認識了青年學生的力量。」</p>
<p>「後來政治性就格外的加強了，這也許是好的，也許是壞的，我不願意評論，但文化的意義，就慢慢的削弱了。我個人覺得這個政治化的運動未免太早，因為力量實在不免，一十九年以來，我個人始終覺得政治的基礎應該建築在文化及思潮的基礎上，從文化方面去努力，規在還要從各方面去努力。」胡先生似乎有些懷疑的說。</p>
<p>談到當時所提倡的白話文運動，胡先出對於當前文字的復古，不禁愝嘆更深了。他對記者說，現在的國民政府是革命政府，但革命政府的文告還是用文言，甚至比文言還要古老，就拿報紙來說，數年來已經有很顯著的進步，也有慢慢用白話交寫稿的，俱大多的報紙還是用文言，所以以「白話文」為例，這已經有點對不起我們那時的時代了，那時我們提倡　話文是在民國五年六年，可是不到幾年的功夫，各小學校的教科書就都改為了圖書，民國十年的時候，白話文白話詩已經是很普遍了。</p>
<p>最後胡先生指出青年的路說：「從白話文時代出來的人，要朝白話走；從新思潮時代出來的人，要朝新思潮走，受過新文化教育的人，我們要向前走！五四時代一方面是破壤舊的，一方面是建設新的，當時的口號是重新估定一切價值，現在這兩方面都還要努力，我們要用努力來紀念五四，不是單單開個會就算是紀念「五四的」。</p>
<p>胡先生本來打算三號回北平，但因為還有點事情沒辦妥，買好飛機票後又退掉了，他飛平前還要到上海去，就由上海乘空中霸王號北上了。</p>

<h3 id="c19">全國運動會揭幕！ <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>第七屆全國運動會，今天在上海市體育塲隆重揭幕，這是一個象徵全國統一和團結的盛會。海內外選手參加這次運動會的，約三千人以上，包括五十餘單位，人人興高采烈，情况十分熱鬧。當此江南草長，海　風平浪靜，羣　齊集，飛來飛去，可說是人間世一件極有意義的事。</p>
<p>全國運動會是團結全國精英，表演體育技能，競取錦標錦旗，創造成績紀錄，提倡尚武精神的一次集會。依過去的慣例，全運會是兩年舉行一次，甚少例外。自從民國廿四年後，已經十二年未舉行了。民廿六年會一度籌備，恰好七七蘆溝橋事變發生，復又停頓下來。去年有人計劃於雙十節舉行，因條件不够，未能實現；這次決定今年五月五日舉行，還是籌備人員奔走籌劃的結果。十二年來，烽火未息，戰亂不寗，不僅體育風氣荒嚴，就是德育智育也日趨下沉了。在此時會，集合海內外精英於一塲，舉行盛大的運動會，意義深遠而重大，未可忽視。如有人以爲今天國事蜩螗，時局不安，何必舉行運動會；我們以爲如此想法，旣無視德智體育的重要，更無視這次全國運動會所提倡的民主風氣。</p>
<p>角力競賽，合羣運動，乃是人類一種美德，合乎理性的一穩團體活動。運動塲的競爭，依秩序，守規則，重時間，幷且服從公意，服從裁判。運動會的比賽，以德服人比以力服人還重要。所以說運動員的精神，是一種民主精神；運動員比賽競爭的風度，尤其是優良的民主鬥士的風度。英國人喻巴力門的競爭，爲良好的運動塲所，巴力門的代議士爲守紀律守規則的運動員。巴力門集合若千思想不同和政見不同的鬥士於一堂，他們爲選舉一人，決議一事，爭吵可能到面紅耳赤，辯駁可能如戰塲嘶殺，可是木鐸一響，全體服從，投票表決，少數服從多數，而散會後握手言歡，親如伯仲，尤爲難能而可貴。這種合乎善良理性的美德，爲民主國家人民所必須具備，唯有運動塲富有這種精神，唯有運動員保有這種風度。因此，我們認爲這次全運會的舉行，時機良好，與其說是提倡尚武精神，母寗說是養成民主風度。</p>
<p>這次參加全運會的選手，不遠千里而來上海，有來自海外的爪哇夏威夷，有來自白山黑水，甚有來自台灣新疆，比過去任何一次運動會熱烈踴躍，陣綫　整，這說明由華兒女的傾向祖國，眷戀祖國。他們不辭千辛萬苦，集中海上，決非爲了爭取錦標，換取一已一地的光榮，他們是爲了合羣團結，表徵中華一家的完整。他們是中國的好男兒好女子，他們要向人類表演和平民主的鬥爭，發揮中華固有的道德精神。他們提倡以運動塲代替戰塲，其志願和抱負？更是可貴與可敬！我們在今天，歡欣鼓舞，迎接第七屆全運會的揭幕，並以報人誠摯熱烈的心情，歡迎不遠千里而來的中華兒女！我們祝福　們：愉快，健康，幸福，勝利！</p>
<h3 id="c20">蒲立德重來中國 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>美國外交家蒲立德先生前日重蒞中國，將有「個月時間的訪問。蒲氏此行雖全屬私人訪問性質，但他關心自去年九月離華以後中國情形之發展，深爲吾人所了解。即此一點，我們對於這位中國之友的重來，就木禁表示由衷的歡迎。</p>
<p>蒲立德先生去年離華返國後，曾在「生活」雜誌上發表「訪華感觀」一文，不僅為美國朝野所重觀，而且在今天我們重讀該文，也不能不欽佩蒲立德先生的先知和卓見。從那時到現在，電時僅及半年，而美國朝野的對華態度實已完全改觀。無論馬歇爾團務卿如何堅持其「歐洲第一」的成見，但也不能不承認援華的重要。而且美國援外法案業經杜魯門總統簽署，在其援外總額六十億九千八百萬美元中，並包括美國在經濟上軍事上援助中國的四億六千三百萬美元。現在中美兩國當局已經換文，願即互訂協定，以執行此項法案。在人事上，美國且已任命精明幹練的霍夫曼氏主持其事。其在美國人民方面，對於中國的態度也已改變。據蓋洛普民意測騐所最近舉行測騐，以「余贊成予蔣主席之國民政府以更多之軍事與經濟提助否？」爲題，向美國人民徵求答案，結果贊成者佔百分之五十五，反對者百分之三十二，無意見者百分之十三，又在贊成者之中，大半是美國的參戰軍人，他們一致認爲欲消滅國際上的亂源，非在經濟上軍事上積極援助中國不可。</p>
<p>美國朝野對華認識的進步，實為蒲立德先生們奔走呼號的結果。他們所發表的卓見，不僅都有事實的根據，而且半年來國際局勢的演變，更加證明了他們觀察的正確。過去美國政府和一般人士，大半希望中國也能聯合各黨各派組織「聯合政府」，以達到和平·民主·統一·强大的目標；馬歇爾將軍親自來華調處國共談判，以及馬帥返國後對於援華問題的淡漠，未必不是因爲他憧憬着這個理想的實現之故。但自今年二三月間捷克發生政變，外長馬薩里克演出悲劇之後，使世人的觀念爲之一變，對於「聯合政府」之類所抱的一切幻想，也都歸於泡影了。此已可以證明共產黨的國際性，不論在何國，中共產黨的掌握政權，人民就不免遭遇到亡國的慘痛。最近中共報紙，公然呌出「革命的戰爭奮門到底」的口號，更可以證明如果還想政府與共黨進行和談，不啻是癡人說夢，與虎謀皮。目下美國朝野當巳認識淸楚了這一點；只是在時間上講，比蒲立德先生落後了六七個月。假定美國朝野早有此項認識，則中國問題或不致糟到今天的地步，自更無需蒲立德先生再度來華了。</p>
<p>但是從另一個角度去看，美國興論界雖一致承認中國問題的嚴重，並共同主張應在經濟上軍事上加緊援助中國，而從美國政府的行動看來，美國援外的重點仍舊不在中國而在歐洲。據甫自美國歸來的貝祖詒氏談稱：「此行帶回霍夫曼處理對華美援物資的意見，截至目前為止，原則問題，均已洽妥，僅技術問題尚待協商。」至於人事問題，據外報所載，華府考慮由美國駐華大使館參贊兼中華救濟團團長吉爾伯主持。美國援華行動的遲緩如此，而我國國內經濟困難情形又如彼；蝸牛式的步伐，如何可使遠水救得近火？要求美國當局的迅速行事，更不得不把我偶的希望再寄托在重來中國的蒲立德先生的身上，希望他六月間返國以後再向美國朝野作迫切的呼籲。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕國務部發言人述及外傳美國將再變更巴勒斯坦政策之傳說時稱，就渠所知，美國並無巴勒斯坦之新政策。渠並透露美駐聯合國首席代表奧斯汀，定四日自成功湖返華盛頓，與馬歇爾國務卿及洛維特副國務卿討論巴勒斯坦局勢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三日電〕英殖民部長瓊斯今日在聯合國特別大會五十八國政治委員會提議設立中立性緊急團體，在五月十五日英國結束委任統治後接管巴勒斯坦。據稱：聖地戰爭危機四伏現正何隙破壞聯合國機構，詳細計劃渠未說明。據消息靈通人士稱，英國主張由若千國家組織一委員會，其份子或即由美·英·法三國擔任。瓊氏認爲美國所提託管方案殊　通過希望，故一部份代表預料美國殆將打消託管建議，贊成英國新方案。加拿大現已予以附議。美代表傑索普雖未直接發表意見，但稱英國方案足以發人深思。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三日電〕聯合國託管理事會頃決定耶城舊城區休戰條件之談判，應在耶路撒冷舉行，並將請英駐巴勒斯坦高級專員克銀漢爵士擔任幹旋。在成立此項決議之前，託管理事會主席美國賽爾報告渠已接獲巴勒斯坦猶太公會執委會主席古利翁之電報，內稱：耶城舊城區之休戰令，業於三日頒發，以待進行休戰條件，包括出入自由等點之談判，但若協議不獲成立，雙方自當恢復行動之自由。賽爾並謂已將該電通知阿拉伯高級委會駐聯合國代表赫賽尼，耶城舊城區之休戰令業已生效，賽爾報告畢，託管理事會即舉行秘密會議，聆取英代表柯克，提出關於聖地休戰談判進展經過之機密報告。柯克堅持聖城市委員會應由一中立人士擔任主席，渠認國際紅十字會駐巴勒斯坦代表，爲可能的主席人選，惟紅十字會之規則，不容其擔任此職。據悉，阿拉伯及猶太雙方巳在國際紅十字會監督下，在耶城進行設立聖城婦孺安全區之談判，惟猶太公會及阿拉伯高級委會駐聯合國之代表，則均宣稱尚不知此事。美駐託管理事會代表，則對紅十字會此項努力表示歡迎，並表示在獲知紅十字會斡旋之結果前，希望能暫停考慮耶城之臨時記管計劃。</p>

<p>光明燦爛話徑賽　長距離的記錄必能刷新  本報記者　章繩治　　〔本報特寫〕這次全運會中的徑賽，長跑行將給我們帶來了二個刷新舊紀錄的大喜訊，同時台灣這支新軍，或者更可以演出幾幕悅目動人的鏡頭。十三年來破碎動亂的田徑界，雖料在今夭以後，將一步一步的踏上光明燦爛的途徑。　　長距離　　沒有疑問的，這次萬米不但可以大大的打碎了過往的紀錄，如果啞將樓文敖的成績繼續能够縮短一分鐘的話，或許還右在世運會中吐口氣的可能。談到這次參加萬米競賽，可以說是大將雲集，競爭必烈，除了樓文敖擁有三十一分廿七秒四的實力，遙遙領先外，海軍劉景現的三十三分廿六秒，亦早已打破了全國舊紀錄孫澈的三四分一秒一。餘子成績在三十五分左右的，亦足有半打之數。此番「瘦猴」王正林留美未返，劉景琨勢可穩取亞軍，聯動安本全亦曾有過三十四分十四秒的紀錄，如果這次能够保得住，那末第三名可有把握。萬米的紀錄雖然可以說穩破無疑，不過唯一的希望還是寄託在樓文敖是不是能够跨入三十一分大關。　　長距離中的五千米亦是一項値得欣慰的事。過去王正林保持的十七分十三秒四，這次已經速遭海軍劉景琨。湖北楊連陞和台灣曾富勝先後所擊碎。前者爲十二分十六秒二，次者爲十六分四四秒，後者爲十六分五三秒七。聯動的安本全亦有十七分十五秒左右的成績此外如河北張道安，東北聶秉英，成績供稱不惡，故預料屆時二三四名的競爭，勢將有一番激烈的悲鬥。　　中距離　　中距離賽跑中，一千五百米有較好的成績出現，據過去的成績，首推老將于希渭，最高紀錄曾達三分五十九秒，道次老于雖然仍參加此項，但現在實力减退，已不復當年之勇，不過以此番參加的各人比較起來，老于的四分八秒還是站在最前綫。此外警察李世明，海軍劉景琨，聯勤車克英，台灣陳萬生，都在四分十秒與十八秒之間，意料中仍不失爲一塲精彩好戲。　　八百米原先亦是老于的天下，在六七年前曾經有過一分五十七秒的好紀錄，現在老于已是年近四十，不免實力衰退，本年四月間在南京試賽中，跑了二分八秒五，成績上尙能予台灣新彗星陳英郞以相當成脅，實在難能可貴。此外，警察李世明在全盛時代跑過二分十秒，最近在南京跑了二分十鈔，證明他的實力仍然不可輕侮，聯動車克英年富力强，曾經在二分的邊綠上盤旋過，如果這次不失態，可以「別別苗頭」。河北的馬連城，在該省預選賽中，二度以二分三秒和二分三秒九打破了華北紀錄，他的跑法頗似當年賈連仁的姿態，步伐輕快，不失爲一勁敵。比較的說來，陳英郞還是最有希望的優勢者，若在激戰之下，縮短三四秒是極有可能的。　　四百米一項，台灣陳英郞可穩取荆州，上月間在預選賽中，一跑即得五十一秒一，打破五十一分六的全國紀錄殊爲輕易，預料這次決賽中，陳英郞可能　進五十一秒關，北平新進選手趙學鴻，聯勤彭開佐，警察金玉寬都在水準綫上，都有搶得位置的希望　　短距離　　這次短距離賽中，臺灣產生了二位新星，許通和徐天德是過去一二年稱覇合省的頭二把交椅。一百米許通成績是十一秒正，現在國內還找不出第二個人，徐天德的成績是十一秒三，海外來的華僑成績亦相當出色，西貢畢洪和馬來亞楊春美都具有十一秒二的實力，是與國內選手空軍冷培樹，江蘇張嘉蔓，上海容承彪等「一別苗頭」。山東的黃驤，成績亦不壤，可能是個冷門，究竟能奮戰到如何程度，頗堪注意的。　　二百米中，恐仍非台灣許通莫屬，他的廿三秒一，還是比較最優異的。此外，陳英郞，徐天德，陳文炎三將，和聯動彭開佐，上海王松壽容承彪，警察邱國雄的實力都在伯仲之間，這次廣東方面的徑賽成績相當貧乏，唯一可以有得分希望的，勢將首推楊瑞淵的二百米，他的成績大約有二十三秒六七的模樣。　　高中欄　　高欄方面，各地預選的成績都屬平平，與全國紀錄黃英傑十五秒七尙相差遠遠的一段距離，唯一可以看看的：北平徐寶臣的十六秒九，和空軍李叔聲十六秒八算是最好的兩人，不過海軍柯炳炎，台灣賴有德，亦都有十七秒正的成績，山束張丕芳的十七秒三，得分的希望亦殊濃厚。　　參加中欄的選手中，一般的成績亦殊低調，台灣的張星賢雖然十數年前跑過五十五秒九的紀錄，但是他今年三十九歲了，已無往年的實力，恐怕再度回進六十秒大門已非易事，（現在的最高紀錄是六十秒七）東北選手李令龍是後起之秀，他在東北預選中，有五十七秒的成績，若是不出冷門，可能有優勢的希望，老將李世明過去亦有五十八秒七的紀錄，可是現在僅能跑到六十一秒二。其他各省市的選手水準太低，幾乎連打破一分二秒的人材都不可得。空軍田徑五傑：自右至左：王瑞，王希渭，黃建？黃任遠」李叔聲。（本報攝）　　已放水之游泳池（本報攝）女壘老手馬蓮秀　　〔本報訊〕廣東女子壘球隊投手馬蓮秀，台山人，爲女子壘壇宿將之一，同時爲名敎練梁扶初氏開山門第一女弟子。投球準確，峻急而帶旋轉性。國內女投手，無出其右，當爲抱奪標雄心之上海女壘之煞星。後臺鏡頭　桂司令指揮若定完全軍事作風　馬蓮秀着高跟鞋居然手投壘球　　海軍總司令佳永淸，在南京仍不時以長途電話，指示參加全運會的海軍隊。昨日中午特電賈連仁，囑海軍特別注意開幕式的繞塲行進，並說：這比奪錦標，取第一都重要。　　昨晚郝更生召各單位總領隊會議，會開到一半，他蹲下來，打開一個牛皮紙包，一層又一層，裏面是三明治，嚼了兩口，選沒嚥下去，又站起來講話。講了幾句，又蹲下去悶吃了。　　會期日迫，各單位紛紛作最後練習，故中正公園淸晨即見各地選手蹤跡。　　昨晨六時，「警察」出動專軍三輛，分載足，壘，田徑選手至該園操練。　　足球由擷傑志及星島留港人員精英而組成之穗警代表，選手以少壯派居多，氣充力沛，自六時練至十一時，毫無倦色；脚法好，速力高。將來能與抗衡者，恐僅馬華，香港，而已。　　星島征英門將余耀德，身手確是不凡，撲接功夫，俱臻上乘，以視張邦綸實無多讓。　　右鋒李炳照，射門有術，出球峻急而角度極刁，危險人物也。　　壘球由臺警代表，昨晨練習，偏重內外塲聯絡，選手技術，頗有可觀，惟擲球時略嫌生硬，殆係半路出家，棒球手習，尙未脫盡之故。　　漢口足球隊今日與空軍作第一戰，故昨晨亦在中正公園作最後練習。由體壇前輩張德江率領。張於六屆全運時，與鐔福楨等同隸華北隊，荏苒光陰，當年同袍，多已風流雲散，言下不勝感慨。　　漢口足球代表，僅十二人，平漢路獨佔其八。　　湖北足球隊五，六，兩屆全運，但於第一週中，被上海隊淘汰，者番重來，仍與上海相逢，三世纏綿，正是一對歡喜寃家。　　湖北隊球門胡彥敏，供職郵局，以請假問題，未能同來，實力頗受影響。　　漢口湖北男女徑賽隊員，孜孜研究接棒技術，教練躬親督導，不壓求詳。覬覦接力錦標之雄心，昭然若揭。　　馬來亞及星洲華僑田徑選手，亦在苦練。八十公尺女欄馬華唯一選手陳淑娥，頻作起步練習。　　廣東女子壘球隊，合嶺南。眞光等校精華，並有獨步國內之香港投手馬運秀助陣。實力堅强，前日雨後初晴，全隊在中訓團東門水泥空塲上作首次練習。馬述秀未着戎裝足登高跟鞋；隨衆練習，投球峻急而帶旋轉性，飲譽多年，果爾非虛，小試鋒鋩，已然奪目，他日上海隊心腹大患也。全運大會會場鳥瞰圖（本報資料室　）空中散發傳單　本報與央航合作　　〔本報訊〕本報與中央航空公司，爲慶祝此次全運會開幕，定今日下午三時，由央航派機一架，飛至大會上空，聯合散發紅綠慶祝傳單，以表祝頌之意。　　全國廣播　　第七屆全國運動會在上海舉行期間，中央廣播事業管理處上海廣播電台，爲便利各地聽衆明瞭起見，決定由五日起，每日上午九時至十二時，及下午二時至五時，分別用中波九〇〇KC，一·二九〇KC，及短波一一·六九MC，播送全運會全部比賽節目。每日下午八時二十分至九時，綜報當日各種比賽成績，運動員訪間，以及會塲特寫。並由中央廣播電台一六六〇KC，及短波一五三五〇KC，及中央廣播事業管理處所屬全國各電台同時轉播。　　映新聞片　　全運會開幕典禮，及火炬接力長跑出發及到達會塲新聞片，中電短片組曾動員全體攝影師分頭拍攝，並以超速度冲洗剪輯出版，由皇后·國際·金門·黃金·四戲院，在今五（日）晚第四堪起加映。「中電」並備有流動放映隊，將此項新聞片，連同總統副總統選舉新聞片，在中訓團全運選手宿舍禮堂中輪映，招待各地選手參觀。全運會本報辦事處特設「社會服務科」　　本報爲發揚服務精神，特於全運會辦事處內，設立「社會服務科」，派負專司其事，隨時爲全體運動員及觀衆竭誠效勞，業務項目，如（一）招尋迷途兒童，（二）待領遺失物件，（三）發售及冲晒大會紀念照片，（四）人事諮詢問題，（五）其他偶發事項，凡有以上事務委託者請臨本報辦事處，（在東司令台東首）塡具表格，自當盡力辦理，爲大衆服務。全運簡訊　　上海廣播電台，定本月五日起，每日上午九時至十二時及下午二時至五時，分別用九〇〇K，C，一三九〇K，C，及短波二·六九M，C，播送全運會全部比賽節目，每日下午八時二十分至九時並綜報當日各種比賽成績。上項節目，由中央廣稱電台六六〇K，C，及短波一五三五〇K，C，轉播，同時中央廣播事業管理處所屬全國各電台亦予轉播。　　本市正泰橡膠廠以全運在滬舉行，特將新出之回力A字球鞋同時貢獻各界，定今日下午一時至二時用中國航空公司專機在市區及會塲上空散發傳單卅萬份，凡拾得傳單上蓋有該廠硬印者得免費贈送A字特製球鞋一雙。又蓋有藍色岡章者，得向該廠會塲內臨時商場購買A字特製球鞋一雙，可享八折優待。　　河南路建新圖書文具公司爲歡迎全運選手，特將各種新型自來水筆减價發售，凡全遝選手，均得憑證特別優待。　　全運大會各委員及職員證章，以時間關係，不及一一分送，各委員及職員尙未領得證章者，請於五日上午十時後至江灣市體育塲游泳池大會文書組領取。吳市長視察江灣運動會（本報攝）全運花絮　大會會場巡禮　便桶問題緊急解決　男賓止步女警侍衛　　〔本報特寫〕全運會揭幕前夕，籌備委員會主任委員吳國楨邀集籌備委員和新聞界同業到全運會的選手宿舍和大會會塲內視察，先在市政府集合，新聞同業參加的極爲踊躍，而籌備委員却寥若晨星，僅吳市長，王正廷博士，趙祖康局長三數人而巳，大會總幹事郝更生，也沒有看見。臨時參加的還有王正廷夫人和兩江校長陸禮華女士，市府新聞處朱虛白處反。　　市長來了一團和氣　　我們記者同坐一大客車，市長小轎車風馳而去，記者列車拼命追也追不着，就此駛往全運會中，下車找市長的車子找不着，會裏的人也不知道有這一回事，於是東奔西走，看看正在練習的會操，大家右些不耐的樣子，後來有一位穿中山裝的人來說：「市長來了，請大家準備。」　　市長眞的來了，他說找我們，我們說找他，由於他那一團和氣的神情，把不耐的情緒都驅散了。　　市長先要找郝總幹事，總幹事不在，於是和幾個會塲負責人商量，他先要看厠所，他說最好會塲內有容納五百人的厠所，方能在大會前門收票。否則，大小便處沒有解決，會成很火的問題的。　　大小便間如何供應　　細詢負責人，到底有多少大小便處，叫他開出來，於是這位負責人默默地記憶和小心的寫着：西司令台三層有女便桶兩隻，男便桶一隻，小便槽一隻。二層有男便桶二隻，低層有便桶兩隻，小便槽一隻。東司令台三層男便桶一隻，女便桶一隻，二層無，低層有男便桶兩隻，女便桶兩隻，小便斗三隻。看台有男便槽兩隻，女便桶六隻，小便槽兩隻，共計算來，便桶只有二十一隻，小便槽只有七隻。而大會觀衆，至少有五萬人以上，如何解決得了「便」的問題？　　人工不夠經費有限　　市長着急了，要去看厠所，先到三層，職員回說厠所門鎖着，鑰匙被人帶走了。再到二層，兩個便桶安置在汚水的中央，職員回說水箱漏水。再至低層，馬桶四週也都是汚水，兩個盥洗盆都還在臨時堆砌，市長問：「怎麼這時候還未做好？」職員答：「做好了壞掉了，現在正在修理。」要看小便槽，職員說：「原定計劃是做的，現在因爲人工不够，只好省去了。」市長一面搖着頭，一而對我們說：「大會經費，中央僅撥四十億，實在不能再說。」記者問上海工商界捐獻若干？知道僅右五十億。　　最後決定大門收票　　我們又去看會塲外面的便所，爲臨時蓋搭，當然也不足五百人應用，不過較塲內多得多了。市長的臨時決定，只好在距大門三四百公尺處收票。記者問那麼車子等等怎麼辦？於是大家商量的結果，還是在大門收票，如要出來大小便，則向守門者索取大小便票證，以便仍可入塲參觀。　　理髮洗澡式式俱全　　來賓大小便問題，總算吿一段落後，再驅車往水電路選手宿舍，宿舍內現容選手一千三百人，原有的不便之處現在差不多都已改善，我們看那巍巍大樓中的男選手宿舍，睡的是兩層的鋼床，秩序相當的好，記者問好幾位男選手，有什麼不便？待遇如何？他們說待遇尙好，也沒有什麼不便。我們參觀了男浴室，浴池中洗浴的人甚多，還另有幾隻浴盆，也有人在洗浴，池內熱氣騰騰，猶似一個「　堂」。還有理髮室，管理宿舍的孫家良處長吿訴我們：女子也可理髮，不過要　髮者「恕無此設備」。　　紅被綠褥　愛美表現　　過女選手宿舍時，見門口貼有「男賓止步」的條子，我們却被優遇而得入內參觀，紅被綠褥各種不同顏色的床舖，這是小姐們特有的愛美觀念的表現。兩個女宿舍，各有女警察兩名侍衛，孫處長笑着說：「這是便於招待之意」。女浴室是新闢的，因爲有小姐們在洗浴，所以未便參觀。　　選手客飯每客十萬　　廚房煮飯是用十餘個大蒸汽鍋爐煮的，據負責人說兩三千人吃飯，都無問題。煮菜處也比較淸潔，原隻的猪羊之類，都被宰割來作爲座上的佳肴，用餐除客飯外，點菜拘可。我們到膳廳，每隻方桌的脚上都貼着「××省」的紅條，據說一千三百多人可以在一起用膳，一點也沒有困難。選手客飯每客十萬元，均由自理。大會僅供煤水。　　走過販賣部，看看樣瓶中的糖，櫉窗中的奶油蛋糕之類，都已被搶購一空。　　郝總幹事趕開籌會　　吳市長對記者說：「本來預料宿舍有問題，會塲無問匙，結果宿舍沒右問題，會場却甚有問題，明晨要郝總幹事在會塲開籌備會，以便立刻解決會塲內的一切問題」。　　正巧市府衛生局張維局長也在宿舍內，記者問他選手們以何種病求診者爲最多？他說感冒的最多，胃不好的次之，我們最害怕的是傳染病，好在選手大半都已種痘，惟防疫針不肯打，理由是恐怕打了有反應，影響了競賽成績」。　　全運會會場內和選手宿舍旣經籌備主任視察一過，則這一個節目已過去，現在是只待開幕了。</p>

<p>麗都花園盛大茶會　歡迎南洋僑胞選手　情緒熱烈一派海南風光　皆大歡喜欣賞清歌妙舞　　〔本報訊〕上海歸僑各團體，昨天下午四時，假麗都舞廳，舉行歡迎南洋華僑全運代表茶會。到檀香山，匪律濱，馬來亞，暹羅，越南，西貢，和印尼，各單位選手，各界來賓四百多人，情况熱烈。　　席間山黃宗　致歡迎詞，外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國廉等亦致詞對各地僑胞，不遠萬里自海外歸來，參加戰後首屆全運會，表示感奮。旋由各單位領隊致答詞，並接　該會送贈各單位之錦旗各一面。　　會中的節目，演講和餘興，間隔排列，一簡演講，一段餘興，這倒是避色疲勞轟炸的好辦法。　　會中餘興，多半南洋風味，南洋名曲，南洋歌，南洋舞。　　遇到南洋選手，大家第一旬話差不多總是問：「習慣不習慣上海的氣候和水土」？南洋各單位，都佳在市區各旅館內，大家都各自張羅，大會期內的交通問題。因爲大會不負責中訓團以外各單位的交通問題。　　男高音大唱民歌　　男高音名手黃源尹，爲這批海外僑胞唱了三隻民歌：新疆民歌「流浪之歌」，綏遠民歌「小路」，靑海民歌「遙遠的地方」，給大家一種淸新的感覺。　　長宮訓詞時，外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國廉到遲了，後來補講，一開頭就說：不知道講廣東話好，還是講福建話好，所以結果還是講國語。但講了一半，麥克風壤了，台下都聽不淸楚。　　前駐新加坡總領事高凌白，以來賓姿態出現，他和記者交談時，第一句就聲明，他不是外交部辦事處的高凌白。　　各單位都有漂亮的制服，但在這兩天的氣候中，多嫌太單薄了。有幾位南洋的女選手，已改穿旗袍。檀香山代表，着的花襯衫，一見面就知道他的來路。　　我想她再來一個　　檀香山，印尼，西貢，暹羅，四單位總領隊　詞下來，台下嗡嗡之聲響了起來。主持人立刻把陳麗）貞女士的高音獨唱提前，果然苗頭十足。高歌一闕，繞樑不絕。encore之聲四起，於是又唱了一曲「敎我如何不想她？」唱完仍是encore，再來一個之後，台下仍是Encore，而陳女士却頻頻鞠躬下台了。　　歸僑聯合會贈了六面錦旗給各單位，上面是「體育健兒」·「僑胞之光」等，而越南西貢也還贈給歸僑聯合會一面「團結精神」的錦旗。　　爪哇華僑許綿淸唱南洋歌，黃鐘大呂全塲鼓掌。　　足尖舞哄動全場　　印尼之花劉美英小姐赤脚跳足尖舞，哄動全場，大家都離開了座位，臃在舞池邊。各報的攝影記者隨着劉小姐的舞步，繞着拍照，這個鐘頭，該是最精彩的。　　壓軸戲是暹羅選手表演暹羅土風舞，兩位男的是龔華樹和韓錦豐·兩位女的也是男扮女裝，一位是蕭篤，還有一位的他旺（暹人客串）。南洋音樂，南洋舞姿，給這些，僑選手們一種親切之感，大家都大笑大叫了！（上）印尼網球選手劉美英表演足尖舞　（下）舉行贈旗（本報攝）　　浙省總領隊李超英（本報攝）浙江隊到達　「浙運之花」跳高有把握　　〔本報訊〕全運浙江省代表隊男選手六十九人，女選手二十人，職員十三人，四日上午六時卅分由杭州出發，於十一時許到上海。由浙敎育廳長李超英親自率領，下車後曾對記者說：「這次參加全運會，省府雖然經濟比較困難，但仍舊撥出十多億經費前來參加，我們參加項目極爲普遍，此次從杭州到上海，秩序很好。」　　這次浙江省的代表中，內有國術舉重何長海，以五〇一磅擊破全國紀錄。他運動的門路極廣，能西洋拳擊，中國拳術，對於籃球亦極愛好。昨天他又說：最近舉重的成績，已在五百二十磅，較浙省全運會時增加了十九磅。　　浙江省開全運會時，有所謂「大會之花」，昨天也一同來了。她的芳名呌李邦瑩，是古西施故鄕人，她跳高有一公尺二十五，這幾天在杭州勤加練習，據說或能跳到一公尺三十，那麼與六屆全運唐瑞容所跳的一公尺三十二，全國紀錄朱天眞的一公尺三十五·五，相差就無幾了。此外値得一提的，是史舜華小姐的短跑，她是號稱「文獻名邦」的餘姚人，在　全運會的預賽中，六十公尺跑過六秒八，百公尺跑過十二秒四，可惜決賽時撲跌傷腿，沒有榜上掛名。這回她也來了，如果預賽的紀錄準確，一如預賽時的成績紀錄，那麼她可以擊破全運會錢行素的十三秒五，全國紀錄焦玉蓮的十三秒二，這實在不容小視。　　浙江的足球隊隊員爲著名滬埠的鐵路隊隊員，經得起一擊，籃球隊浙全運大專組冠軍之江大學選拔棄權後，由亞軍浙大及公開组冠軍杭市等合組而成，練習賽曾敗於貴州隊，故實力平平。壘球·排球，都是以浙大爲茲幹的。女子籃排也都是以浙大做基礎，女子籃球隊也竹敗於貴州。依此而論，在全般的　隊中，當以足球隊或可稍露頭角。浙選手何長海（本報攝）　　浙省田徑女選手，中爲浙運會之花李邦　（本報攝）東西兩司令臺各設有記者席　　大會爲便利新聞記者採訪起見，已決定將田徑塲之記者席設於東司令合，台下即爲註册組，栽判組，宣傳組，俾記者便於與各有關單位聯絡，而各項競賽之終點，亦大部設於東司令台前。在交通方面，東司令臺與游泳池，體育館，籃球場，之距離亦最近，可减少奔波之勞，但大會關幕及閉幕儀式，皆在西司令台舉行，與記者席遙遙相對，以距離較遠，對採訪工作，容有不便，故大會決定於開幕及閉幕日，在西司台旁設立臨時記者席，俾便各報社記者採訪。但以座位有限，盼在採訪上有必需之記者入座臨時記者席外，其餘仍坐於東司令台上之周定記者席上。裁判會議　通過馬約翰辭職照準　江良規兼任副總裁判　　〔本報訊〕全運會裁判組昨日下午二時假中國銀行四樓舉行裁判會議，到全體栽判二百六十餘人，由裁判組長江良規主席，首由總栽判兼栽判委員會主席張伯苓氏致訓，略謂：「此次全遝會係在極度困難之環境下努力促成，而華僑參加單位視前爲多，更覺意義深長。國人體性太溫弱，須藉敎育改善，應從體育鍜鍊着手。運動會中的競賽，是爭名不爭利，是有規則的爭，即是守法的爭，値茲行憲之始，尤具潔長含義。明日大會開始，亦即各位困難的開始，希望大家要團結，負責任。」會後並舉行分組會議，由各項裁判長分別主持，商討執行技術等問題。又大會副總栽判兼終點裁判長馬約翰，因病辭職，當經通過照准。副總裁判一席，由張伯苓常塲推舉江良規兼任，終點裁判長則派夏翔担任。朱家驊昨巡視江灣市體育場　　四日上午十時，全運會總幹事郝更生，陪同大會會長朱家驊，巡視江灣市體育塲·游泳池·籃球　球塲等，朱氏對運動場之金部工程，得能如期完成，頗表　許。本報廣播全運消息　　〔本報訊〕本報爲迅速報道全運會新聞起見，特約亞美麟記電台，（週率九四〇呼號（LAH2）每日晚間十一時至十一時十五分，播送本報當日全運會消息？全運會本報辦事處展覽全運新聞照片　　〔本報訊〕此次全運揭幕，爲全國人士所矚目，本報隨時派有攝影記者多名，舞取名貴鏡頭，其中一部分業經冲洗放大，陳列在全運會塲申報臨時辦事處門前，以供展覽，並備有全部樣本，供各界選擇購置，迎日洽購者頗衆，預料大會開幕期內，必更擁擠。男選手宿舍一角（魯少飛繪）五軍足球實力管窺  本報記者　桑濬　　〔本報特寫〕五軍（陸軍·侮軍·聯勤·警察·空軍）足球隊參加本屆全運會戰，可能是使大會產生高潮的主要因素之一。這五支勁旅乒種雖殊，而在球塲上慓悍的戰術則各有所長。先看陸軍的重勢：　　黃仕傑　秦必高（▲）　　吳凱敏（▲）　吳祺祥（▲）　　張仁義　瞿永福（▲）　　孟義良（▲）　薛沛然（▲）　　金祿生（▲）　羅壽福（▲）　許文奎（隊長）　張金海（▲）　高秀清（▲）　顧以撒　劉體寅　費春華（▲）　姜闌靑　　這當中，有（▲）符號的是正式上塲的陣容，他們幾全部是靑白隊的老人隊，技術的熟練與合作的微妙，對於每一個上海的球迷都太熟悉了，無須再說。該隊首戰逢靑島，北師方於日前到滬，船上週餘勞頓，遠來疲敝，疆塲大忌，如果應付稍有差池，當必吃虧無疑，所以靑軍戰術，應該充實第二三綫，前鋒不妨互爲畸角，空張聲勢，虛與委蛇，陷戰況於膠着，最是上策。　　次輪海軍，全隊宿將甚多，再加上東華，青白，南華，體德各隊的後起之秀，實力頗有可觀。該隊已定的陣容是：　　高智文（▲）　徐亭　　强遠智（▲）　劉永麟　谷昭（▲）　　唐鼎銘　謝錫川（▲）　金川瀚（▲）　伏波（▲）　尚世祺　　宦名積　劉志光（▲）　殷慶秉（▲）　譚祖德（▲）　經林桂　商華鈞（▲）　韓同楨　孫輝文（▲）　　其中金，殷，譚，都曾以能征善戰著稱於東華等隊，他們的技巧配合海軍原基幹隊的體力，不啻溶精薈秀，故戰來繞有出神入化之妙。該隊組成後，在京即以二對〇一舉擊潰南京市足球代表隊。此番首戰遇香港，後者以新式踢法見長，前者以剛柔並用自勵，究是誰家天下？當看兩雄全力的如回發揮了。　　　光耀　　徐劍萍　饒平雄　　可振猶（▲）　袁世友　黃競忠（▲）　彭羣　紀獻鄂（▲）　　　姚大鵬　張通根（▲）　胡宗益（▲）　曾昭羣（▲）　郭志順（▲）　胡光宇　周定國（▲）　　該隊唯一特點是全隊均係聯勤職員，無其他球隊的球員加人聯動總部最近在京曾召開過一次該部各單位的聯合運動會，足球一項，武漢區榮獲冠軍，南昌區居次，此次陣容即根據成績選拔組織，武漢區佔十人，都是以前在鄂省運動會上，代表漢口市得足球冠軍的「環誼隊」的名將。這次聯勤正式上場的前鋒五人，中堅，門守，和後衛，盡係武漢區的選手，實力平均，前後並重，能攻善守，加上初戰就碰着東北主力大連隊，南北雄師相對，這一塲廝殺定然不同凡響。　　大連隊這次遠道長征，其所以憑藉的實力究竟如何？寫出來恐怕北國人士知之甚諗，該隊全隊十六人中擁有「東北風」隊基本斡部十一名，「東北風」這幾年來是平，津，瀋，長，一帶鋒芒萬丈的勁旅，去年在平與華北混合隊八次交緩，連勝八塲，轉戰各地，無不發揮其疾風壓勁草的咸力，勢如破竹。這股東北風吹來吹去，弄得關內外一致震驚，這次挾其主流的餘威南征，演出精彩自是「準沒錯兒」。他們這次有一宗憾事，「東北風」二台柱郭鴻賓，王壽先因覊留長春，交通不便，未能隨大隊南下，所以前鋒一綫，在攻取方面未免遜色。但幸後衛綫有王政，王立斌鎭守，此二公技術超羣，足以獨當一面，雖強敵如聯動，如不採特效方法，恐亦難越雷池。　　再論響察，他的應戰陣容是：　　余耀德（▲）　曾培福　　莫錦松　曾仲雲（▲）　鄭英權　　劉天申　游華興　劉慶才　　曹秋亭（▲）　伍求廣　譚振輝（▲）　譚煥章（▲）　趙富　李炳照（▲）　謝錦河（▲）　　這當中，除了球門以外，幾乎每綫都有香港今年足球冠軍隊「傑志」隊負的加入，二譚，游，鄭，尤其是該隊柱石，他們的個人技藝，滬上人士多耳熟能詳，毋庸細說。該隊組成後在京曾經三塲惡戰：以六對〇大勝美軍混合，以四對〇擊退南京代表隊，最後又以六對〇大勝中美混合隊，三隻鴨蛋的贈與足够反證輝煌戰蹟，這次首戰與四川相逢，強弱是顯而易見，但川隊殺搏不足，沉毅有餘，數十回合來往之間，精彩的脚頭定不在少。　　最後論空軍，這是一支從南京空軍運動會中產生的隊伍，他的陣容是：　　謝爲熹　陳海洋　　劉寳麟　張宗耀　張夢眞　　劉大爲　郁黎華　劉紹良　　麥潤明　周永楨　　永發　薩寶　　梁廣鎮　梁銑佑　袁定勇　　此隊配置整齊，各綫實力平衡，以前征滬時曾以一對〇負於鐵路，後又以四對三勝體德，該隊隊員一色梢長大漢，長力驚人，與漢口隊周旋起來，定多驚險鏡頭。盱術大局，勝負之數，恐尙有一塲劇烈爭奪。</p>

<p>文學今後文藝的動向  孫福熙　　中國的實行民主已將開始，因此中國的政治社會文化敎育等一切設施，必須從新改革，從新建立，如果改頭換面，有名無實，或者抱殘守缺，苟安偸生，不但是毫無進步，而且錯過機會，把中華民族的復興從此斷送了。　　文藝是民族的靈魂，應該領導一切，向前　進，絕不能受任何事物的束縛與阻撓，更不能使文藝家自卑自欺，縮頭縮脚。　　文藝家的使命是，在憲法允許的範圍之內，盡量的發表意見，畫量的以先知知人，先覺覺人，如果稍有顧忌，知不盡言，言不盡意，不但愧為文藝家，實在愧為民主國民。即使憲法所未許者，文藝家以親身所感受，或以悲天憫人，大無畏的精神，為民間疾苦作大聲的呼喊，揭起革命旗轍，使憲法的運用亦有所改變。此種先例，不但在民主國听常見，即在專制暴君之下，亦時見不匙。就近代言，法蘭西有左拉，美利堅有林肯，而中華民族之孫中山先生，於辛亥革命以至國民革命，先有文字的呼喚與感召，而繼之以政治社會的革命運動，都是明確的先例。　　我們認識文藝使命的重大，方能重新建立文藝的營壘·文藝與宗敎一樣，其威武莊嚴，誠神聖不可侵犯，但能尊崇供奉，順其理性，實可稱為無所不包的萬應　，其功效之宏廣精妙，遠非意料所能及，事無大小，隨意應川，絕對順從而見效。只要利用者的動機是至公無私就是了。　　今後，欲使文藝發　其最大功效，首先要尊崇文藝的客觀性，好比宗教，決非藉佛廟以惑衆歛財，作者以國家民　為目標，讀者亦屏除自私猜疑的成見，有如明鏡，有如淸泉，把社會現實絲毫不爽的反映出來，人人虛心接父，則政治社會文化敎育事事均有改革的新機，而民族精神隨之少壯而刷新，這纔是名符其實的民主國家。題潘韻峨山道中景  鄭午昌　　萬　千峯滿幅春，胸中有墨筆無塵；筍輿幾日穿雲上，同作峨嵋頂上人。渡船  周山　　在西南，那多山地帶，一條小溪，也有奔騰澎湃的時候！激流險灘，更是無數：羊角磧，伏波灘，李家嘴，鬼門關，是何等驚心動魄的塲面啊！　　當炎夏，山洪暴發，大江裏漲滿了水的時候，那聲勢更是壯觀了。渾濁的江水，在萬山叢中，以無比的速度，夾着人畜和打爛了木船的碎片，穿過亂石堆，繞過猙獰的山嘴，喧囂地擁擠地向前奔流！一個一個大漩渦，在迥轉在冷笑。浪花似釜中沸水：下面有暗礁起伏。就在這樣的大江上，那些船伕，那些靠水吃飯的人呀，却不論是嚴寒或酷暑，每天駕一葉扁舟，載十幾個乘客，往來其間。他們有比水更靈活的身手！有比水更嘹喨的喉嚨：　　「來不來……？上走溫潭，二岩，白沙沱，澄江口！」　　「去不去？下走唐家沱，白廟子，土沱……！」　　那些趕船的「包袱」「背篼」「箱子」「籮篼」，一個個在呼喚聲裘上了船。而碼頭上又走來一個人，船伕們蜂擁上前，把他包圍了；　　「鬍子！這條船。」　　「草帽！草帽！是走二岩　？對頭！上這條船．」　　「雜種！你要裝多少人？」　　「你龜兒子昨天才裝一船，又要搶呀？　老子！我們三大三天沒裝人哪！草帽！上船。」　　「你先人喲，你沒裝人，該你背時！」　　那個被錫名為「鬍子」和「草帽」的老人，歇下擔子，用衣角擦去面上的汗珠：　　「我是過江的　」。　　爭奪，辱駡，希望，都像閃光的泡沫一樣破碎了，消失了！　　船在衆乘客的催促聲中，離開碼頭。但並不即刻就走，却在距岸丈多遠的江面林徊，企圖再等一兩個趕遠路的客人。他們那凝視的神情和眼色，是期待！是焦急！是絕望！　　「老闆，你呌我們遊江嗎？」　　「你索性上岸，拉幾個人上船！」　　「客人，生活高哪！幾天才輪到一次……」　　是呀，誰不感受到生活的重壓！誰不在絕境的邊緣上掙扎！對這種直率的訴說，我們能有什麼理由，再苛求他呢！　　斜陽將江水燒紅，小船正溯江而上。下行船如風捲殘雲；如夏夜流星，瞬息已到眼前，掌舵的打招呼了：　　「王五哥，你安得逸了！」　　此刻，王五哥和他的助手，正同激流搏鬥！這是突出在江中的兩槐山石，而船必須從它們間的空隙穿過！水迅速的衝下，王五哥右手猛撑橈桿，左手掌着丈餘長舵，兩脚緊蹬艙板，稍稍仰起的躺臥着身子！而岸上助手，正俯伏沙灘，一根縴　，斜縛肩頭！他像狗樣葡匐爬行！　　時間一分一秒的過去，江水因小船阻住了缺口，它激怒了：咆哮着，旋轉着，猛力的衝過來，小船顫慄了。　　「客人！莫動」　　只在一瞬問，小船平穩的度過險隘！　　「雜種」！　　「用力」！　　王五哥紫銅色的面上，滿是汗珠。臂膀的肌肉，一塊塊隆起：他一漿緊接一漿的划着！船頭上年靑的水手冒火了：　　「　老子！吃奶的力都用了」；　　「你老子的漿，光在水面上打」！　　「雜種，我……」　　船在互駡中划近了岸：一座山嘴，擋住了汹湧的江濤！他們放下漿。王五哥燃起一支劣牌捲烟，猛吸數口，託客人遞給年靑的水手：他們和好了！　　稍遠，二三十個縴伕，正拖曳一隻笨重的貨船上灘：　　「喲！喲！喲！嘿……喲！」　　沉重的呼聲，仿彿是從地底吐出的悲哀的嘆息！　　小船在晚霞如火的黃昏裏，靠攏了碼頭。王五哥一邊接過客人的船錢，同時以抑揚的聲調喊着：　　「客人！小東小西的，各自　點」！海湼八行詩  廖曉帆譯　　崇高的海誓山盟，　　鎖住了我倆的心，　　它們偎貼得很緊，　　它們了解得更深。　　啊！只有裝飾你胸襟的，　　一朶年靑的玫瑰，　　道可憐的伙伴呀！　　幾乎被我們壓碎。　　那女郞站立在海邊，　　遼長而憂傷地嘆息，　　似乎那太陽的沉淪，　　引起她莫名的悲哀。　　我的女郞啊！快活一些吧！　　這是一樁多麼平凡的事啊！　　今兒它雖然墜落下去了，　　可是明天它又會爬上來的。　　海在陽光下閃光，　　海面似鍍了黃金，　　朋友們，假如我死了，　　請你沉我入海心。　　海永遠那末溫和，　　它有軟綿的碧波，　　時常冰凉着我的心，　　願伴它一直永恒。　　我有我理想的祖國，　　那兒檞樹長得挺高，　　紫蘿蘭溫情地招迎，　　可是那祇是一個夢，　　那姑娘和我親着德國式的吻，　　並且用德文說：“Ich　liebe　dichl”　　（世界上再沒有那樣美好的聲音呀！）　　可是那祇是一個夢。上海文藝作家協會主編　文藝雜誌試刊弁言  王進珊　　試刊者！非創刊也；嘗試創刊也；或曰：是亦創刊矣。　　創刊照例有詞，試刊豈能無話，因寫試刊弁言。　　本會一無經濟基礎，二無配給紙張，三無印刷設備：原沒有出版刊物的條件。然而又為什麼要出刊物呢？那就是因為會章規定，應該出刋物；會員要求，需要出刋物：而且默察現實環境，更非出一刋物不可。　　理由之一，是會章規定本會任務在謀求文藝事業之發展，會員作品之介紹與出版，以及作家之聯絡等等。所以應該出刊物。　　理由之二，是本會會員均以從事文藝寫作與文藝工作爲職責，為了發表作品，交換意見，當去年今日本會成立之日，即已共同要求出版刊物了。所以需要出刋物、　　理由之三，文藝是時代的反映，又為大衆精神食糧，當前不但一般文藝書刋的出版凋零衰落，而且有些簡直利用文藝形式，從事破壞國族利益的宣傳，為新封建勢力做帮兇。有些居然還繼續着敵偽時期的奴化文藝作風，將作品的內容意識倒退到五四運動以前，麻醉着讀者的靈魂；代表了舊封建勢力的迴光反照。此外還有許多醉生夢死的作者，正和前面兩種人一樣，也漠視於時代的動向，和現實社會脫節，以名士自居，沉溺於自我陶醉，吟風弄月，不知所云。——以上這些不但有負於文藝神聖，玷辱了作家尊嚴；而且荒謬荒唐，終於造成了大衆精神上的飢荒。所以適應客觀環境之需要，更非出一刊物不可。　　因此，迭經歷次理事會暨常務理事會議之決議，毅然決然，籌辦純文藝性月刊一種，以期接受會員要求，適應讀者需要，而實踐本曾任務，達成本會宗旨。　　有幾句話已經在本會成立宣言中說過，現在還値得重述一遍——　　作為一個精神技師的文藝作家，似乎首先應該多負起精神敎育的責任，忠於文學藝術，忠於生活體驗，忠於寫作自由；共同建立新的寫作信念，和新的文藝作風。——道是一年前本會組織的動機，一年來已成了會員共同的信念；一年後的今天，就在這個共同信念之下，誕生了本刋的試刊號；隨着試刋號的誕生，又建立了本刋今後的目標；　　第一，發揚民族文藝　　第二，創造時代文藝　　第三，促進文藝建設　　第四，提高文藝水準　　在這四項目標之前，本刋不但要和寫作數十年的成名作家握手，也要和勇於學習，前途無量的靑年朋友握手。我們反對宗派觀念，更無門戶之見，本刋不但要作為會員共有的刋物，更期望，全國忠實於文藝的同道，視作文藝的公共園也。　　今日敬謹以嘗試的態度與讀者相見，尤其誠懇的等待着讀者的指導與協助。最近的世界文壇  趙景深　　心理小說家柏洛司特　　最近阿伯林（Justin　O＇Brien）在紐約時報書報評論上談到法國心理小說大家柏洛司特（Marcel　Proust），大意云：二十六年前，一九二二年十一月十八日，柏洛司特死在巴黎。據說他知道他自己死期將近，吩咐他那忠心僕人塞勒斯特（Celeste）把他未完的手稿交給他，就是叙小說家柏戈特（Bergotte）之死的那一段。柏各司特在仙最後的痛苦之中，曾經加上一節，最後結語是：「仙們埋葬了他，但在整夜的袁楨中，在光明的窗子裏，他的書三本三本地排列着，好像安琪兒展開了她們的翅膀，似乎是他復活的象徵，雖然他已經死了。一　　柏洛司特所創造的想像的小說家柏戈特大部分都是象微他自己「不曾完全死掉」，他的確想到了他自己。他自己的傑作「過去事件的追求」（A　la　Recherche　du　temps　Perdu）已經出過十册了。。直到他死後五年，這偉者的最後部分方　出版。　　根據他的理論，「過去」不死，但也不忠實地存在，像炭畫一樣，却是飛動的意識印象。開頭幾卷，他叙史　（Swann）愛上了一個沒有價値的阿德特（Odette）。他用冗長的篇幅來分析愛和妒的心理，收入「史做的路」中。他又在「平原的城市」中叙述同性戀愛。　　柏洛司特死於五十一歲似乎是特別不幸的。法國文學中與他同時的三位老將，兩位此他年紀大，古勞德爾（Claudel）和紀德，都還活着，繼續寫作；比他年靑的哇萊荔（PaulValery）一直寫到他一九四五年逝世。倘若他還健在的話，應該有更大的成就。即使不能產生別的作品，至少也司以把他的偉著修飭得更完整。有許多刊稿都不曾經過他的修正。一九一三年柏洛司特曾把一千五百面的原稿，修飭成四千面。這比例是可怕的。他要是活到七十歲的話，他的傑作一定要大大地增修。　　在柏洛司特一九二二年之死到他一九二七年傑作最後一卷出版，是他的聲譽最盛的時候。他的著作已譯成各國文字　　柏洛司特死後不久，一八九六年所出版過的詩和短篇小說重印出版。一九二七年他偶然寫作的雜誌文章也結集出版。還有好幾位研究者替他的小說編索引。又有好幾位研究者替他寫評傳。　　一九四〇年一位年靑的美國學者阿爾登（D．W．Alden）研究關於柏洛司特，從一九一三年到一九三八年，共有一千七百篇長短的文章。各人所論不同，有談到音樂，繪畫，記憶，猶太人，高級社會等等的，也有談作風，美學結棈，印象主義，敎訓的應用等等的。　　柏浴司特的死給予研究者許多材料，有談到他小說中的地理，也有談到喘息症對於他作品的影響的。同時柏洛司特七卷書信出版，也供給研究的方便。不過這些書信對於柏洛司特頗為不利，顯得這位作者大自私，太勢利，不眞誠，完全與他著作的博大精神不相稱。評者又覺得柏洛司特只寫上流社會，未免範圍狹隘。　　現在知道柏洛司特的人已經較少，原因是，第一，他的著作現在已經不大容易買到；第二，人們也沒有讀這樣大著的閒暇；第三，他所寫的都是有閒階級，為現代靑年所不喜。但他到底是値得紀念的，他的心理分析，他的敏銳觀察，他那細膩的　寫，都是可以稱讚的。　　他在仙的傑作末尾說：「無疑地我的書，像我這人一樣，終於有一天是要死的。但是一個人應該放棄死的觀念。我們承認十年以後的屍骨，和百年以後的畫，不再存在。書與人的永生是不大容易的事情。」我們希望他的作品總有一天能够復活，得到普遍的承認和欣賞。　　赫塞的德米安　　瑞士作家赫塞（Hermann　Hesse）一九四六年會獲得諾貝爾文學獎金，廿八年前曾作過一本小說「德米安」（Demian）。在這二年代的早期，第一次世界大戰還是創傷的經驗，理性似已破產，弗洛以德的探討，在一些人看來，足以證明舊的眞理是不恰當的。這部小說對於歐洲年靑的知識階級便有了深的激動，甚至於在美國也發生了影響。　　它激動讀者的是它對於善惡看法的革命態度，它預言一般的洞察（德米安說：「像現在這樣的世界是應該死的，應該滅亡的，一定要死亡的。」），它拒用思想和行為的舊方式，幾乎是違反人性的。個人高於社會，命遝高於格言。書中的一位說：「他唯一的願望就是聽憑命運做去。他沒有親人，孤寂的站着，只有寒冷的空間圍繞着他。」　　在今大看來，「德米安」裏面的故事並不怎樣新，但它却仍舊是新鮮的。故事開始於一八九〇年，結束於一九一四，叙的做愛彌兒。辛克萊（Emil　Sinclair）的兒童時代和靑春斯。　　這書前牛是學生生活經騐的光輝記錄。他奴役於詐欺取財的暴漢，又曾做過德米安的奴隸。德米安成為他的天使和魔鬼。他逐漸明白黑暗世界（不可知與不可說）與光明世界（可知與可說）的分別。這一半寫得新鮮，結實而且聰明。　　這書後牛的生活比前半豐富而且奇怪。象徵的夢和繪畫，禮拜堂地下室的消息與繁會，卓絕的關係，聯成一根自我和命運的帶子。故事的光亮逐漸成為　氣，只剩下早年的熱力和閃光。自由談「夏令時間」  吳庸　　「夏令時間」，又名「日光　約時間」。筆者對於這兩個名稱，曾經下過一番思考工作，思考之下，不得其解，乃進　向友朋請敎，請敎之下，對友朋的解釋仍未能十分滿意。轉思此制或創自西洋，乃翻查字典。筆者乃一窮士，所備字典不多，又愧未能「精通數國文字」，只好查查英文字典，翻查之下，發現「更令時間」或「日光節約時間」的字樣爲較舊的字典所未備，只有在一大新近出版的英漢新字辭典裏查出Daylight-　aving　time一詞，據其注釋，此劃起遠於美國，蓋即「日光節約時間」，其辦法乃是「比較標準時間撥快一小時，在初夏開始；到秋季撥問一小時。」關於這點，筆者是早已知道了的；我所要找尋的不是此制的意義，而是此制的用意，可是關於這點，字典上也沒有詳細的說明。　　抗戰時期中，在淪陷區裏敵人於春夏之交也曾施行「日光節約時間」，那時有很多人疑為此即「東京時間」，因之心裏也就覺得「不足為奇」。可是時至今日，不明這個辦法之用意的人如筆者的，一定數不在少。我們要問：實行了這個辦法，把鐘點撥快了一小時，究竟有什麼好處呢？　　所謂「把鐘點撥快一小時」也者，即依原來標凖時間是上午八點鐘，現在依照夏令時間便是九點鐘了。在都市上寫字間的人們，如果辦公時間是上午九時至下午五時，那末便該依標準時間早一小時起身到辦事處去，下午便可較原來時問早一小時下班。早晨提早一小時起身，只要晚間提早一小時睡覺，便可柿償過來，那是無所謂的；下午提早一小時下班，對於處理私人事務方面倒有不少的便利。因為走出治事之所，抬頭見天色還早，離天黑尙有三四小時之多，儘可探望親友，或蕩蕩馬路，至不濟也可早些返家休息。只是這祇為了私人的方便，如果祇是為了這點，我覺得殊可不必施行夏令時間，通令全國遵行。　　或謂實行夏令時間，乃是要全國人民多做一小時的工作，換言之，向之工作八小時者，今須工作九小時，即是辦公時間提早了一小時，而下班時間並不提早之意。這個用意原也很好，可是事實上並不見得如此做。其次，即使要呌人們多工作一小時，就把辦公時間延長一小時便可，又何必把鐘點撥快一小時呢？　　或謂把點鐘撥快一小時，即是提早一小時下班，其意乃在節約電力。此說與事實晚不相符。國人有一句俗諺：「肺要睡冬至的夜，玩要玩夏至的日。」這是說冬季夜長日短，而夏季則是日長夜短。以中國在地球上所處的地城言，確是如此。冬季裏下午五時餘便已是黃昏，在夏季雖照標準時間已是快近七時，可是天色還未見黑，可見日光節約時間的實行至少在我國是與簡做無關的。而且依天日的長短而論，在冬季實行這個「夏令時間」的辦法倒是較合情理，蓋如此方可免五時下班天色已黑之弊，而且確可收節電之實效。　　筆老頭腦簡單，見識有限，想來想去，實在想不出「日光節約時間」的用意何在。自然，實行了「日光節約時間」，　處想來也是不會有的。疑問重重  毛毅　　從報上看到一條奇聞，說是一頭鳥啣了一根燃着的香烟放到她的巢中，因此燒燬了鳥巢，也使簷下的房屋發生火災，造成一百五十元的損失。報紙的報道書在於此。但是，這對我似乎還留下一大塊空虛。（編者按：請參看四月卅日本刋發表之「事有湊巧」一文。）　　無數的間題從心中湧起，第一個自然是：到底是怎麼一會事？那鳥想用烟蒂溫暖牠的巢嗎？那香烟是那一種的？鳥如何得來的？是從吸烟者的嘴上，手中，抑或烟灰缸中啄來的？假如屬於後者而那烟灰缸又在房間內，鳥又怎樣飛進去的？又怎麼樣飛出來的？　　鳥也和常人一樣的吸烟嗎？還是牠祗不過用嘴啣着？可有行人看見牠啣烟飛過嗎？牠可是誠心想把巢燒掉？把牠所依傍的房十燒掉？　對房東痛恨嗎？牠把烟蒂誤作為　熱的蠕虫嗎？還是一顆螢火虫？這證實牠是近視眼嗎？抑或僅祗是愚蠢？　　假如牠的烟蒂是從一個人的嘴上或者手中奪來的，那個被奪的人的反應如何呢？忿怒？震驚？他，或者她，怎麼辦？驚呼一聲「嗨」。抑或向那頭鳥撲去？還是另外點一支煙，說道；「我敢打睹說　頭愚的息是去把烟蒂扔在她的巢中，造成一百五十塊錢的火災」？　　我很抱歉在這裏如此的好奇，但是伏爾泰，或者王爾德，也許是另外一位大文豪曾經說過：「詢問連你自己也不能够答覆的適當的問題，是一件偉大的事情。」如果這樣，我做得也許不錯。（派　·　士著）一個機會  梅白　　全國運動會　天開幕了。我們中國似乎已經成為一個最善於開會的國家，然而這個會却是生氣勃勃，與眾不同—旣不會為了拉票而鬧出五花八門的笑話，也決不會通過了無數專做時事八股的議案就算功德圓滿。全國運動會在這一方面看來，誠然應該是一個最「乾凈」的會。　　但我們也不能忽略了全國運動會在另一角度上的意義。在兵荒馬亂的今天，從邊遠省分和海外華僑的代表踴躍參加的一點上看，全運會是很可以發生一種增加「向心力」的作用的。　　政府如果想使「天下歸心」，這是一個機會。但是，這個機會如果不能好好的利用，則本來可以做到「天下歸心」的就可能　一變而成為「怨聲載道」，因之產生非常嚴重的影響。所以，主持這一屆全運會的人，責任是相當重的。　　事實上這次歸國參加的僑胞單位，許多都還是第一次出席全運　在祖國多事之秋，他們不惜長途跋涉，回來共襄盛舉，我們應當如何熱烈招待，來表示對遠人的關懷！而事實上台灣新疆選手　進了宿舍之後，全運曾當局竟始終連照料的職員都不肯派一個去！據我確切知道，合灣選手們　進去的第一夜，旅途勞頓，亟待休息，宿舍無人招呼，何自己動手搬舖蓋，準備睡覺；而宿舍的房主所在這時突然聲明這一間大房間不在宿舍之列，要選手們立即搬開！最後還是經過了台灣代表團的負責人再三情商，才算是姑准寄宿一夜，到了明天，選手們祗得再親自提了舖蓋搬家！臺灣同胞們始終沒有一句怨言，他們還處處體諒全運會。我不知道全運會做局會想出些什麼話來解釋，我們祗覺得實在慚愧—因為，我們老百姓對一個從遠地回來的弟兄是不肯道樣失禮的：在戰火遍地的時候，久別重逢，正應當痛痛快快的敍一敍，我要罄我所有的來歡迎他，怎麼可以旣冷眼相看於前，又半夜逐客於後？　　全運會的負責人如果深明大義，凜然於自己責任之重大，就應常以一個遝動員的坦白精神，毅然出來向台灣選手們道歉！　　我們不能讓一個「乾凈」的會留下任何細微的汚點，我們不能輕輕放　爭取「向心力量」的任何機會—我們更應當發揮我國傳統的友愛和慷慨的精神！天羅地網  雷嬰　　幼時讀七俠五義之類武俠小說，對「冲霄縷」「銅網陣」的許多捉人的「機關」，常常非常神往，覺得神妙莫測，大有意思。　　不想，今大看到美國刊物上一段新聞，倒發現了一位專門安設「消息」和「機關」的發明家。他是美國米希根州卡洛地方人，名W．，摩爾。他最近在他的家裏巳把全部「機關」裝好，任你有大大本領，如果夜間　進了這做子，就呌你插翅難飛！　　這些「機關」是這樣的：一有生人進鬥，　動「機關」，立刻就全屋電燈通明，每一間房間的門都自動鎖上，同時電話局裏也接到了報警的電話，警察局裏的警鈐大鳴！　　麼爾先生天天在等候樑上君子光降，可惜至今尙未如願。浮生六記中二畫師　　浮生六記由林語堂兪平伯提倡，搬上舞合，搬上銀幕，江以南殆無不知沈三白者。兪平伯說：「此記所錄所載，妙肖不足奇，奇在全不着力而得妙肖；韶秀不足異，異在韶秀以外竟似絕無他物。儼如一塊純美的水晶，只見晶瑩，不見襯露明瑩的顏色；只見精微，不見製作精微的痕跡。」立論中肯，若斤斤謂文章佳秀，未免短視矣。三白殆亦千古之傷心人歟？設使當年賢伉儷白首偕老，何由作此六記哉？「閑情記趣」所記蕭爽樓中三畫師，三吳之名畫師也，茲錄三畫師簡傳以供讀者參考：　　楊昌緒，字補凡，號鳳凰山人，長洲人，國學生，善山水，渾厚秀逸，曾至苗疆，飽覽山川奇勝，後客阮元嫏嬛仙館，與諸名流遊，畫益工，士女仿六如，雅韻有致。　　袁沛，字少迂，鉞子，山水淸腴秀逸，尤著名都下，書法圓潤。　　王嚴，字星瀾，繆椿高第，花卉工致，翎毛栩栩欲動。（吳文勳）作家小事  晉霖　　以「三劍客」一書名震世界的大仲馬，不用藍紙寫不出小說，不用黃紙寫不出詩，要是想寫篇小品文，就非用玫瑰色的稿紙不可。　　他從來沒有用過藍色墨水。而他寫劇本的時候，必須躺在沙發上，在肘子底下襯放一個柔軟枕頭，才能文思泉湧。　　韋爾斯因作足球裁判員被踐踏而受重傷，過了十二年的痛苦生活，但亦因此而成為世界聞名的紅人。　　他寫作的地域沒一定，或在倫敦辦公處，或在車子上，或在地中海畔，而當他腦中突然湧現什麼思潮時，隨時便在筆記本上記下來。多睡無益  何島　　許多人以為身體偶有不適，總以多睡為是，却不知據最近若干醫學界權威研究的結果，多睡非但無益，而且竟還會引起別的毛病來！英國的醫學權威艾休博士最近就警吿醫師們說：「當我們叫病人睡覺之前，務須仔細考慮一下；須知柔軟的被褥雖頗舒適，可是多睡的害處却是相當可怕的。」　　艾休博士說，多睡可能引起肺病，或使原來的肺病加車。它也能使皮膚病更趨嚴重，能使航肉漸漸失去活動力，能使骨節酸痛，也能引起腎病，胃病，心臟病，神經病。　　譬如說，人睡在牀上時，當然不會多動，而常常保持着相同的姿勢。這就能使身體裏腺體的分泌集合在氣管中，因而易致失眠。如果是有肺病的人呢，睡在牀上之後，因為沒有什麼運動，呼吸量因之减少，病肺就不易復原。　　但艾休博士認為最可怕的還是在於多睡之影響血管。肌肉的運動减少，血行便因缺乏刺激而遲緩，因之血液有凝結成塊的可能，因之而血管發炎—這是可以致命的病症。醫學家已經從患有這種血液凝塊病的病人中加以研究，結果發現有百分之五十三的患者都是曾畏期臥病在狀的。　　多睡之後，骨骼的運動大减，而骨骼如不運動，骨骼中的鈣質便會慢慢流川，這對老年人尤其危險。這些鈣質往往會流到腎臟裏，於是小便中鈣質加多，極易引起腎石症。還有一個容易引起的可怕的病症：小便不通。　　多睡也易引起便泌和肝胃氣痛，這些　對老年人都有危險性，而牀上摺疊被褥時揚起的塵埃，更於肺部有害。　　不過，艾休博士也鄭重聲明，他並不是一味的反對病人睡覺，睡覺的確是可以有裨於治療的，但是千萬不可睡得過度。他認為「睡覺」也和別種藥劑一樣，應當由醫生處方，讓醫生來決定你是否需要睡覺，應睡多少時候。（譯者註：艾休博士的原名是D．R．A．J．Asher，本文即取材於艾氏在英國醫學雜誌British　Medical　Journal上發表的一篇論文。）　　金　輝之父前清肅親王善耆，係清初論功封定之世襲封爵，所謂「鐵帽子王」，在清末已屬遠支。舊時都城，如此類王公甚多，無人重視。惟善耆以知新政識時務得為民政部尙書，則因庚子之變，淸廷恍然大悟，標榜維新，而宗室世爵中，尙多憒憒，善耆獨得風氣之先，早有研究，並遺子女留學日本，遂嶄然於親貴之中。其人又酷慕風雅，用心書畫戲曲，能演武戲，與武生兪振亭為好友。書法苦學劉石庵，其同官烏珍（民政部侍郞）代為印成小册，請名翰林徐花農（琪）為之題　題詩。善耆自題「臨劉文淸公」，又題，「名之曰臨，實為未似。」實有自知之明。劉墉字體「綿裏針」，本不易學，學者多臃腫拙笨難看。善耆所臨雖未似，尙無俗態，不甚討厭耳。徐花農（杭人，俞曲國得意高弟）題詩曰：「醉中三斗去朝天，神妙難傳到筆巔，何似偶園家學遠，恍如詒晋　雲烟。」「侍郞此舉足千秋，信是中朝第一流。自古鐫華推石墨，而今突過太淸樓。」並序云：「偶園主人平日作書，無乎不工，此册筆宗董劉兩家，而兼平原蘇黃之妙，昔賢述書，所謂才苞古人者，洵當之無愧，余故拈四字題　，且賦二詩，以副恪謹侍郞流播藝林之雅。」此序過於恭維，不足為據，徐所題之書法都甚妍美。「偶園主人」者，即善耆之別署，册中圖章又有「偶遂事主」，「肅親王」，「偶然公」等稱，最妙者為「羊頭老人」四篆字。蓋其名「善」之上半是「羊」，故曰「羊頭」，可謂「善自　兮」，「不為虐兮」！</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] The 7th National Games is scheduled to open at 3:00 PM today at the stadium in the city center. Nearly 2,700 athletes will participate, representing more than 50 units. Since the first National Games held in the late Qing Dynasty, 37 years have passed. The various sports achievements throughout the years are due to the dedicated participation of provincial athletes, with new records being constantly broken. This holds profound value in the entire history of education and sports. After the closing of the 6th National Games, according to regulations, the 7th National Games should have been held in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. However, the "July 7th Incident" [Marco Polo Bridge Incident] broke out, and the War of Resistance began, leading to an indefinite postponement. With the implementation of the constitution imminent and the suppression of the rebellion in full swing, the government is still striving to hold the 7th National Games in "55" [of the Republic, i.e., 1966, an obvious typo in the original], which is of profound significance. What is particularly encouraging for the people of the whole country is that the enthusiasm of athletes from various units to participate is even greater than in previous games. The Xikang team walked a long distance for as long as nine days. The Jilin team traveled south, braving the dangers of crossing bandit areas. The Taiwan province and overseas Chinese also showed unprecedented enthusiasm. This contains an epoch-making significance. The conference has invited the heads of various ministries and commissions of the central government, government officials, political committee members, and foreign guests, about 70 people, to participate in this unprecedented National Games. Honorary Vice Chairman Dai Chuanxian will also attend on behalf of Honorary Chairman Chiang, and the Chairman's special instruction, which was conveyed here today by the torch relay long-distance running team, is particularly valuable. Other major programs held today, such as football, basketball, and mass exercises, are also scheduled to be held at the same time. It is firmly believed that after the opening of the conference, facing the challenging circumstances, athletes will surely create new national records in sports achievements, in order to live up to the deep expectations that our government and people have accumulated in their hearts for more than ten years. The conference is scheduled to last for eleven days, with the closing ceremony to be held on the 15th. (For various programs of the National Games, please refer to the 5th, 6th, and 7th editions.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The 7th National Games is scheduled to open in Shanghai on the 5th. Chairman Chiang specially issued instructions, including the torch relay for the National Games. The long-distance running started at 3:00 PM on the 2nd from the National Government in Nanjing. The planned instructions were delivered to the Shanghai National Games venue, and the conference officially declared its opening and read them out on the spot. The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is recorded below: To the athletes of the 7th National Games:</p>
<p>The 7th National Games is being held three years after the victory of the War of Resistance, just as the constitutional government is beginning and before the World Games. The participating units cover the whole country. The athletes from the Northeast are happy to reunite after a long separation, and the athletes from Taiwan are even happier to return to the motherland. Reflecting on the past and learning from history, we deeply feel that this National Games not only has epoch-making significance, but also shares the tasks of the world. Not only should young athletes be excited, but the people of the whole country should also place great expectations on it.</p>
<p>Originally, the survival of a nation requires the sound development of morality, intelligence, and physical education. In particular, physical education is the basis of both morality and intelligence. Only with a strong physique and abundant spirit can we be resourceful and make progress day by day in terms of moral character, cultivation, and intelligence development. The wisdom, benevolence, and courage shown by our ancient sages and the two arts of archery and charioteering were listed as the center of the Six Arts, which is consistent with this principle. I hope that the athletes of the National Games will deeply recognize this noble truth and strive hard in the sports field. Strive for excellent performance in both technology and morality, bring the spirit of the Chinese nation to the world sports arena, and radiate brilliant light. At the same time, bring the harmonious feelings from the sports games back to the hometowns of the athletes, so that the feelings of our entire nation can be more closely exchanged and more sincerely united. And bring the special achievements gained in this conference back to the schools and places, encourage the atmosphere of love for sports, and make our national sports catch up with the progress. This is the most enthusiastic hope of Zhongzheng for the National Games, and it is also the greatest achievement of all the athletes. I wish you hard work, I wish you success, Chiang Chung-cheng.</p>

China has expressed in its agreement to abide by the provisions of the US foreign aid legislation and sign a bilateral agreement with the United States. Before the bilateral agreement is signed, the conditions, types of materials, and handling details of aid to China will be based on the relief method after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Therefore, China can obtain some basic necessities of life as donations, such as rice, wheat, medicine, insecticides, cotton, tobacco, petroleum products, coal, and fertilizers. According to the relief agreement after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the replacement of machine parts is not included. The agreement specifically stated that assistance in the form of rehabilitation assistance or loans will be stipulated in future agreements. Rural rehabilitation programs will also be included. The Economic Cooperation Administration has $50 million in funds paid by the Export-Import Bank, and all aid to China funds are awaiting Congressional approval and allocation. However, Congressional appropriations for aid to China will be discussed after the appropriations for the European recovery plan are passed, and only when Truman formally requests it. The current agreement is only valid until July 3, and if the bilateral agreement is not signed by then, the aid to China plan will be temporarily shelved.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] The bandit troops of Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, Chen Geng, Kong Congzhou, and Li Jingyi, who gathered in the Fangcheng, Huayang, Yexian, Lushan, and Nanzhao areas, began to move at the end of last month, fleeing to various counties in Wancheng. The situation is serious. The bandits' large-scale fleeing attempt this time is to destroy the local forces in Wancheng, open up the corridor of Funiu Mountain, Wudang Mountain, and Tongbai Mountain, and threaten Sichuan and Shaanxi. The entire battle situation is very critical.</p>
<p>[Our Own Report, Xi'an, 4th] Two brigades of Kong Congzhou's bandit troops in western Henan fled to Shanxian yesterday. Our local teams, with a large disparity in numbers, temporarily retreated to the southwest suburbs of the city under the leadership of Qin Tingyu, commissioner of the 11th District, to block the attack. At the moment, leading figures and gentry from Lingbao came here, calling for weapons and reinforcements. In addition, the area along the highway line from Zhenping in southwestern Henan to Xiping Town on the border of southern Shaanxi has had contact.

<h3 id="e18">29th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement: Hu Shih Points Out the Path for Youth <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] On the morning of the 29th anniversary of "May Fourth," a reporter found Mr. Hu Shih, a leader of the "May Fourth" Movement. Mr. Hu began by stating definitively to the reporter: "The 'May Fourth' Movement was a new thought and new culture movement; it was not a political movement at the time." Mr. Hu then recounted the situation at the time, saying: "At that time, we felt that if we wanted to promote a new culture and new ideas, we had to establish a new foundation on a non-political basis. So, our proposition at that time was to not engage in politics for twenty years; some even advocated not talking about politics. Not talking about politics is impossible, but many of us did indeed refrain from engaging in politics for twenty years. I personally only became a diplomat twenty-one years after the May Fourth Movement. We tried our best to avoid politics, but politics could not avoid us; on the contrary, it forced itself upon us, so that the May Fourth Movement slowly became a political movement. Leaders of various parties all recognized this as a great force. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in a letter to overseas comrades, mentioned the greatness of student power. Other communist parties and other parties also began to recognize the power of young students."</p>
<p>"Later, the political nature became extraordinarily strengthened. This may be good, or it may be bad, I don't want to comment, but the cultural significance was slowly weakened. I personally feel that this politicized movement was a bit too early, because the strength was inevitably insufficient. For nineteen years, I have always felt that the foundation of politics should be built on the foundation of culture and thought. We should work hard in cultural aspects, and now we must work hard in all aspects." Mr. Hu seemed to say with some doubts.</p>
<p>Speaking of the vernacular movement advocated at that time, Mr. Hu could not help but sigh even more deeply at the current revival of classical Chinese. He told the reporter that the current National Government is a revolutionary government, but the government's documents still use classical Chinese, even more ancient than classical Chinese. Take newspapers for example, there has been significant progress in recent years, and some are slowly writing articles in vernacular Chinese, but most newspapers still use classical Chinese. So, taking "vernacular Chinese" as an example, this is already a bit unfair to our time. At that time, we advocated vernacular Chinese in the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China, but in just a few years, the textbooks in all elementary schools were changed to vernacular language. By the tenth year of the Republic of China, vernacular Chinese poetry was already very common.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Hu pointed out the path for youth, saying: "People who came out of the vernacular era should move towards the vernacular; people who came out of the new thought era should move towards new ideas; people who have received a new cultural education, we must move forward! The May Fourth era was both about destroying the old and building the new. The slogan at the time was to re-evaluate all values. Now, we must work hard in both of these aspects. We must use hard work to commemorate May Fourth, not just hold a meeting and call it a commemoration of May Fourth."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu originally planned to return to Beiping on the 3rd, but because there were still some things that were not completed, he bought an airplane ticket and then cancelled it. Before flying to Beiping, he will go to Shanghai first, and then take the "Air Overlord" north from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Commemorations by Students Everywhere</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] Female college students held a "May Fourth" 29th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting this morning. More than 3,000 people from more than 40 units, including National Central University and National Chengchi University, participated, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The meeting urged Mr. Fang Hao, a student leader in Beijing during the May Fourth Movement, to give a lecture on the May Fourth Movement. Subsequently, representatives from universities and colleges gave speeches one after another, unanimously emphasizing the implementation of democracy, the development of science, and denouncing the Communist bandits' attempt to use youth to slander this patriotic movement. Afterwards, female students presented flowers to Mr. Fang Hao, and the entire audience responded with warm applause. The meeting ended with shouts of slogans, and then the movie "Blood Splattered on the Lion Grove Bridge" was shown to entertain the participating students. They dispersed happily until after 11 o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Opening of the National Games! <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Seventh National Games will open grandly today at the Shanghai Municipal Stadium. This is a grand event symbolizing national unity and solidarity. More than 3,000 athletes from home and abroad are participating in this games, including more than 50 units. Everyone is elated, and the situation is very lively. At this time, when the grass is growing in the south of the Yangtze River, the sea is calm, and the birds are gathering and flying around, it can be said to be a very meaningful event in the world.</p>
<p>The National Games is a gathering to unite national elites, showcase sports skills, compete for trophies and flags, create performance records, and promote the martial spirit. According to past practice, the National Games is held every two years, with very few exceptions. It has been twelve years since 1935. The 1937 Games were once prepared, but the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident happened, and it was suspended again. Last year, someone planned to hold it on Double Ten Day, but it could not be realized due to insufficient conditions. This time, it was decided to hold it on May 5th of this year, which was the result of the hard work of the preparatory personnel. For twelve years, the flames of war have not ceased, and the war has been unsettled. Not only has the sports atmosphere been barren, but also moral and intellectual education has been declining. At this time, gathering elites from home and abroad in one place to hold a grand sports meeting is of far-reaching and significant significance, which cannot be ignored. If some people think that the country is in turmoil and the situation is unstable today, why hold the sports meeting; we believe that this idea ignores the importance of moral, intellectual, and physical education, and also ignores the democratic spirit promoted by this National Games.</p>
<p>Wrestling competitions and group sports are a virtue of mankind, a rational and stable group activity. Competition in the sports field follows order, abides by rules, values time, and obeys public opinion and referees. In sports competitions, winning people with virtue is more important than winning people with strength. Therefore, the spirit of athletes is a kind of democratic spirit; the demeanor of athletes in competition is especially the demeanor of excellent democratic fighters. The British compared the competition in Parliament to a good sports field, and the representatives of Parliament to disciplined and rule-abiding athletes. Parliament brings together fighters with different ideas and political views. They may argue until their faces are red and their ears are burning for the election of a person or the resolution of a matter, and the debate may be like a battleground, but at the sound of the gavel, everyone obeys, votes, and the minority obeys the majority, and after the meeting, they shake hands and reconcile, as close as brothers, which is especially rare and valuable. This kind of virtue that conforms to good reason is essential for the people of democratic countries, and only the sports field has this spirit, and only athletes have this demeanor. Therefore, we believe that the holding of this National Games is well-timed, and it is more about cultivating a democratic demeanor than promoting the martial spirit.</p>
<p>The athletes participating in this National Games have come to Shanghai from thousands of miles away, some from Java and Hawaii overseas, some from the White Mountains and Black Waters, and even from Taiwan and Xinjiang. It is more enthusiastic and active than any previous games, and the line is well-organized, which shows that the Chinese sons and daughters are inclined to the motherland and nostalgic for the motherland. They do not hesitate to go through all kinds of hardships to gather at sea, not for the sake of winning trophies and exchanging for the glory of one's own place, but for the sake of unity and symbolizing the integrity of the Chinese family. They are the good men and women of China, and they want to show mankind the struggle for peace and democracy and promote the inherent moral spirit of China. They advocate replacing the battlefield with the sports field. What are their aspirations and ambitions? It is even more valuable and respectable! Today, we are happy and excited to welcome the opening of the Seventh National Games, and we welcome the Chinese sons and daughters who have come from thousands of miles away with the sincere and enthusiastic feelings of reporters! We wish them: joy, health, happiness, and victory!</p>
<h3 id="e20">Pu Lide Returns to China <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>American diplomat Mr. Pu Lide returned to China the day before yesterday and will have a "month-long visit. Although Mr. Pu's visit is entirely private, we understand his concern about the development of China's situation since he left China last September. Just from this point, we cannot help but express our heartfelt welcome to the return of this friend of China.</p>
<p>After Mr. Pu Lide left China and returned to his country last year, he published an article "Impressions of Visiting China" in "Life" magazine, which was not only valued by the American government and the public, but also today we reread the article, we cannot but admire Mr. Pu Lide's foresight and vision. From that time to now, only half a year has passed, and the attitude of the American government and the public towards China has completely changed. No matter how Marshall persists in his prejudice of "Europe First," he cannot but admit the importance of aiding China. Moreover, the US Foreign Aid Act has been signed by President Truman, and its total foreign aid amount of 6.098 billion US dollars includes 463 million US dollars in economic and military aid to China. Now the authorities of China and the United States have exchanged letters, willing to immediately sign an agreement to implement this act. In terms of personnel, the United States has also appointed the shrewd and capable Mr. Hoffman to be in charge of the matter. In terms of the American people, their attitude towards China has also changed. According to a recent survey conducted by the Gallup poll, asking the American people for answers on the topic of "Do you support giving more military and economic assistance to Chairman Chiang's National Government?" The results showed that 55% of the people supported it, 32% opposed it, and 13% had no opinion. Among those who supported it, most were American veterans, who unanimously believed that to eliminate the source of international chaos, it is necessary to actively assist China economically and militarily.</p>
<p>The progress of the American government and the public's understanding of China is the result of Mr. Pu Lide and others running around and calling for help. The insights they published are not only based on facts, but also the evolution of the international situation in the past six months has further proved the correctness of their observations. In the past, most of the American government and the general public hoped that China could also unite all parties and factions to form a "coalition government" to achieve the goals of peace, democracy, unity, and strength; General Marshall personally came to China to mediate the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the indifference to the issue of aiding China after Marshall returned to his country, may not have been because he was dreaming of the realization of this ideal. However, after the coup in the Czech Republic in February and March of this year, and the tragedy of Foreign Minister Masaryk, the world's perception changed, and all illusions about "coalition governments" disappeared. This has already proved the international nature of the Communist Party, and no matter what country it is in, the people will inevitably encounter the tragic pain of national subjugation when the Communist Party takes power. Recently, the CCP newspaper publicly shouted the slogan of "fighting the revolutionary war to the end," which further proves that if you still want the government to negotiate peace with the Communist Party, it is like a fool's dream, seeking skin from a tiger. The American government and the public have now recognized this point clearly; it is just six or seven months behind Mr. Pu Lide in terms of time. Assuming that the American government and the public had this understanding earlier, the China issue would not have been so bad today, and there would be no need for Mr. Pu Lide to come to China again.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, although the American commentariat unanimously acknowledges the seriousness of the China issue and jointly advocates that economic and military aid to China should be stepped up, judging from the actions of the American government, the focus of American foreign aid is still not in China but in Europe. According to Mr. Bei Zuyi, who has just returned from the United States, "This trip brought back Hoffman's views on handling US aid materials to China. So far, the principled issues have been negotiated, and only technical issues remain to be negotiated." As for personnel issues, according to foreign newspapers, Washington is considering having Mr. Gilbert, the counselor of the US Embassy in China and the head of the China Relief Mission, preside over it. The slowness of American aid to China is so slow, and the domestic economic difficulties in our country are also like that; how can the snail-like pace make the distant water save the nearby fire? To request the American authorities to act quickly, we have to pin our hopes on Mr. Pu Lide, who has returned to China again, hoping that after he returns to his country in June, he will make an urgent appeal to the American government and the public again.</p>

Among them, 900 able-bodied refugees and their families are about to be sent to Suiyuan to engage in land reclamation.

<h3 id="e39">U.S. Policy on the Holy Land Remains Unchanged; Austin Flies to Washington for Talks with Marshall; Britain Suggests Establishing a Neutral Provisional Body <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] When a State Department spokesman was asked about rumors that the United States would again change its policy on Palestine, he said that as far as he knew, the United States had no new policy on Palestine. He also revealed that Austin, the chief U.S. representative to the United Nations, would return to Washington from Lake Success on the 4th to discuss the situation in Palestine with Secretary of State Marshall and Under Secretary of State Lovett.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] British Colonial Secretary Jones proposed today to the Political Committee of the 58-nation United Nations Special Assembly to establish a neutral emergency group to take over Palestine after Britain ends its mandate on May 15. It is claimed that the war crisis in the Holy Land is now destroying the United Nations mechanism, and a detailed plan has not been explained. According to informed sources, Britain advocates a committee composed of several countries, whose members may be drawn from the United States, Britain, and France. Jones believes that the U.S. trusteeship plan is unlikely to pass, so some representatives expect the United States to abandon the trusteeship proposal and support the new British plan. Canada has now seconded it. U.S. representative Jessup, although he did not directly express his opinion, said that the British plan was thought-provoking.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The United Nations Trusteeship Council has decided that negotiations on the terms of a truce in the Old City of Jerusalem should be held in Jerusalem and will ask Sir Knox Helm, the British High Commissioner in Palestine, to mediate. Prior to the establishment of this resolution, the Chairman of the Trusteeship Council, U.S. representative Searle, reported that he had received a telegram from Gulion, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Community Council of Palestine, stating that the truce order in the Old City of Jerusalem was issued on the 3rd, pending negotiations on the terms of the truce, including freedom of entry and exit. However, if an agreement is not reached, both sides will resume freedom of action. Searle also said that he had notified the Arab Higher Committee's representative to the United Nations, Husseini, that the truce order in the Old City of Jerusalem had taken effect. After Searle's report, the Trusteeship Council held a closed meeting to listen to the confidential report of British representative Kirk on the progress of the Holy Land truce negotiations. Kirk insisted that the Holy City Committee should be chaired by a neutral person. He believed that the representative of the International Red Cross in Palestine was a possible candidate for chairman, but the rules of the Red Cross did not allow him to hold this position. It is reported that both the Arab and Jewish sides are conducting negotiations in Jerusalem under the supervision of the International Red Cross to establish a safe zone for women and children in the Holy City, but representatives of the Jewish Community Council and the Arab Higher Committee to the United Nations have both stated that they are unaware of this matter. The U.S. representative to the Trusteeship Council welcomed the Red Cross's efforts and expressed the hope that consideration of the temporary trusteeship plan for Jerusalem could be suspended pending information on the outcome of the Red Cross's mediation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 4th] The Trusteeship Council adjourned on the night of the 3rd without reaching any agreement on the protection of Jerusalem. The joint efforts of representatives from China, France, New Zealand, the United States, and Britain failed to dispel the determination of other countries to refuse the use of force in Jerusalem, and the suggestions of France to use international troops and the United States to establish temporary trusteeship were also rejected.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 3rd] British troops patrolled the streets of Jaffa today. The British Army Headquarters in Jerusalem announced that the entire territory of Palestine was quieter today, with only occasional shooting incidents in the Arab village of Qatamon in the southern suburbs of Jerusalem, disrupting the ceasefire order issued yesterday.</p>
<p>Arabs in Jaffa continued to withdraw in large numbers by sea and land. There are only a few thousand Arabs still in the city. British troops occupied Tel Rish Hill south of Jaffa this afternoon and warned both Jewish and Arab sides that anyone shooting in the area would be bombarded. A unit of British Marines arrived in Jerusalem today to reinforce the defense. Jewish forces are still holding the Arab village of Qatamon in the southern suburbs of Jerusalem, and their defense line has been extended near the British security zone. A spokesman for the Jewish Community Council declared at a press conference today that Arabs had withdrawn in large numbers from Safed, a city in northern Palestine's Upper Galilee where Jews and Arabs live together. The spokesman also said that there was a general mentality of escape among the Arabs of Palestine and that none of the twelve members of the Arab Higher Committee were still in Palestine.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] U.S. authorities confirmed on the 4th that for months, thousands of Japanese men and women have been working hard to build a strong air force base. The base is located in northern Honshu, within fighter range of Vladivostok, a major Soviet Far East military base.

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 4th Broadcast: Bevin delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, reviewing the world situation in a realistic tone. Soviet Ambassador Tsaruhin also appeared in the diplomatic seats. Bevin said that if the Soviet Union insisted on spreading communism around the world, the chances of the great powers finding a real and lasting solution with the Soviet Union were very few. In the tense war of nerves, Britain maintained its composure, but this was not a sign of weakness on Britain's part. Britain hoped that the current provocation would be replaced by frank discussions. Referring to the fact that the five countries of the Western European Union appointed a permanent military committee in London last Friday, Bevin continued, the five countries have successfully begun to jointly review their military issues, but we have absolutely no intention of aggression. Bevin's speech was followed by thunderous applause.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The House of Commons began a two-day foreign policy debate on the 4th. Foreign Secretary Bevin attended and spoke about Britain's Palestine policy and its relations with the Western European Union. The Conservative Party attempted to discuss the general relationship between Palestine and the Soviet Union and the Middle East in this foreign policy debate, as well as the possibility of communist expansion into the Middle East and the Far East, but Bevin did not intend to review general international relations or mention Britain's relationship with the Soviet Union in this debate. Churchill was originally scheduled to explain his attitude towards the Western European Union in the debate in the House of Commons on the 5th. It is now known that Churchill has decided to wait until the European United States Conference opens in The Hague on Friday, when he will personally attend the meeting and express his views.</p>

The Army team is the embodiment of the Qingbai soccer team in this city, all of whom are first-class famous players in the country. There is no doubt that they will win Qingdao. Zhejiang is the Railway team of Shanghai, which once dominated the sea. Although some of the strong players of the Guangdong team are scattered into the Police team, their strength is still above the standard. Most of the players in Dalian City are strong players of the "Northeast Wind". The Air Force United Logistics should not be underestimated, and there will be a fierce competition.

Meeting of Chief Delegates from Fifty-Eight Units Several Important Cases Were Agreed Upon [Report from this Newspaper] Hao Gengsheng, Secretary-General of the National Games, invited the chief delegates from the fifty-eight units participating in the National Games to a meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium at 8:30 PM yesterday. Zhang Boling, Chairman of the Review Committee, attended and delivered a speech, explaining the significance of sportsmanship. Subsequently, the registration team reported that the registration team would be responsible for collecting vehicles for transportation for athletes living in the Central Training Corps if there were competitions in the urban area, and there were 20 vehicles responsible for traffic between the Central Training Corps and the venue. For units living outside the Central Training Corps, transportation problems should be solved by themselves. In addition, there were errors in the printing of the conference order book, and the daily schedule should be used as the standard. In addition, if the number of participating places and the number of admission places in each competition are equal, the original six places will be changed to five places, and the original four places will be changed to three places. Hot Water is Not Enough; People are Complaining The Taiwan Female Athletes Want to Eat Watermelon [Report from this Newspaper] The athletes from all over the country in this National Games have some disappointment with the conference office. The female athletes from Fujian told reporters that they arrived in Shanghai on April 27, standing in the open air for more than three hours, and no one entertained them. As a result, some people slept on the cement floor overnight. Wang Jinshu, a female tennis player from Guiyang, is over thirty years old. After arriving in Shanghai, she suddenly grew wisdom teeth, and her gums were swollen and she had a fever, so she fell ill. She is anxious and has been consulting a doctor for treatment for days. There is no hot water supply in the athlete's dormitory, and they all use cold water for bathing, which causes most of them to catch a cold. Moreover, there is also a lack of boiled water in the dormitory. Except for the boiled water available during meals every day, it is not easy to drink at other times, which causes the athletes to complain. When the reporter visited yesterday, I saw a female general from Fujian throwing a suitcase and losing her temper. Among the female athletes in Taiwan, some were sick because they could not eat watermelon in Shanghai and suffered from constipation. They said: They must eat watermelon three or four times a day in Taiwan. The price of fruit in Shanghai is expensive, and it is not good. Many of the athletes are coming to Shanghai for the first time. Their first tour is to visit the four major companies, but they are all shocked by the crowds. The representative from Fujian said: "I never thought there would be so many people in Shanghai." The athletes from Taiwan said: "The continuous stream of cars on the road made us faint." Before coming to Shanghai, the athletes from Guiyang first went to Hangzhou for a week-long trip. They all said: Hangzhou is beautiful and quiet, what about Shanghai? It is dirty and chaotic. The Guizhou team has the best autonomy spirit in the National Games. A large notice was posted in front of the dormitory, stating: "The team's rest time is stipulated below. Those who do not follow the stipulated time will be dealt with according to the province's athlete management measures." Strict regulations are made for the time of getting up, roll call, practice, breakfast, lunch, lunch break, dinner, and rest.

Six thousand young men and women showed their skills for the first time. The participants all wore white shirts and blue shorts, neat and magnificent, and the picture was extremely beautiful. The girls were in the center of the field, surrounded by the boys, full of energy, and the audience praised them. The gymnastics is a common set of twelve exercises, and the movements are accompanied by military music. When the music starts, thousands of young men and women wave their hands and feet, neatly and consistently, which won warm applause from the audience. At that time, Chairman Wu Guozhen, Wang Zhengting, and conference officials, reporters from various newspapers, etc., happened to visit the sports field. Chairman Wu and others all applauded and praised, and the crowd of onlookers became more crowded. After the second rehearsal was completed, the applause lasted for a long time.

[Report from This Newspaper] The staff of the special interview broadcasting vehicle of this newspaper have been working hard since they departed from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 1st. There is still half a day's journey left today, and they will be able to complete the entire journey. I can't help but feel excited. This newspaper and the Shanghai Branch of the Mountain Country Amateur Radio Association jointly organized this Beijing-Shanghai torch relay long-distance running interview and broadcasting. The association's enthusiastic service and support for news reports are commendable! Whether it is the deployment of amateur radio stations across the country, the installation of equipment in special vehicles, or the roadside broadcasting reports since departure, especially Mr. Xu Yujia's leadership of the work, they have done their best and best efforts. It not only fulfills the original intention of this newspaper to promote sports and serve readers, but also lays the foundation for future cooperation between this newspaper and amateur radio experts. I am deeply grateful. The special vehicle was rented from Liangjiang Automobile Company, which is the latest type of tour bus. The company offered preferential prices. The departure date was during heavy rain, and the Beijing-Shanghai highway was in disrepair for many years. For the sake of prudence, the company specially sent Chen Xianqi, director of the service department, to accompany and take care of it. On the afternoon of the 1st, only a dozen kilometers away from Changshu, the road was narrow and steep, and a major accident was almost caused. Fortunately, Mr. Chen's command and the driver's calm response turned the danger into safety. We are very grateful for the company's assistance this time. The situation when the torch relay long-distance runners passed through Meiyuan, Wuxi. The ones on the right are the escorting students from Jiangnan University (Photo by Ji Jingqiu) Soccer Game Schedule Fieldside Chat The athletes from various provinces are greatly troubled by the language barrier in Shanghai, especially the overseas Chinese from Nanyang and the representatives from the border areas. As a result, many people have been taken advantage of as "Ah Mu Lin". I sincerely hope that our Shanghai municipal staff will correct this if it is true, and if not, encourage each other, so as not to leave such a bad impression on these compatriots. Today there is a group exercise program with 6,000 people. This is the most valuable item in the entire National Games program, because cultivating a spirit of cooperation and training organizational skills is far above creating a few sports stars. It cannot be said that Shanghai has not done its best in the financial burden of this National Games. However, after the athletes from the Shanghai team went to various places to raise money, it is said that they are preparing to "go shirtless", which is ironic and tragic. I hope for a miracle tonight, so that we will not lose face for Shanghai today. Some of the representative teams did not have an item for accommodation expenses in their budget. After a few days of "Yangtze" and "Jinmen", a large amount of funds was spent. They are worrying about the "how to return" problem after the conference is over. (O·K·).

<p>Brilliant prospects for track and field events; long-distance records are sure to be broken Reporter Zhang Shengzhi [Special Feature by This Newspaper] The long-distance races in this National Games will bring us two pieces of great news: old records will be broken. At the same time, the new force from Taiwan may stage some pleasing and moving scenes. The track and field community, which has been fragmented and turbulent for thirteen years, will, after today, step by step embark on a bright and brilliant path. Long Distance Without a doubt, the 10,000-meter race this time will not only shatter past records significantly, but if the deaf-mute general Lou Wen'ao can continue to shorten his time by one minute, there may still be a chance to catch his breath at the World Games. Speaking of this 10,000-meter race, it can be said that great generals are gathered and competition will be fierce. In addition to Lou Wen'ao having a strength of 31 minutes and 27.4 seconds, far ahead of the others, the navy's Liu Jingxian's 33 minutes and 26 seconds has also broken the national old record of Sun Che's 34 minutes and 1.1 seconds. There are also half a dozen or so with scores around 35 minutes. This time, "Skinny Monkey" Wang Zhenglin has not returned from the United States, and Liu Jingkun is sure to win the silver medal. An Benquan of the United Logistics team has also had a record of 34 minutes and 14 seconds. If he can maintain this time, he can be sure of third place. Although the 10,000-meter record can be said to be definitely broken, the only hope is still pinned on whether Lou Wen'ao can cross the 31-minute mark. The 5,000-meter race in the long distance is also a gratifying thing. The 17 minutes and 13.4 seconds held by Wang Zhenglin in the past has been quickly broken by Liu Jingkun of the navy. Yang Liansheng of Hubei and Zeng Fusheng of Taiwan have broken it successively. The former is 12 minutes and 16.2 seconds, the latter is 16 minutes and 44 seconds, and the latter is 16 minutes and 53.7 seconds. An Benquan of the United Logistics team also has a score of about 17 minutes and 15 seconds. In addition, Zhang Daoan of Hebei and Nie Bingying of the Northeast have scores that are said to be good, so it is expected that the competition for the second, third and fourth places will be fierce. Middle Distance In the middle-distance race, there is a better score in the 1,500 meters.</p>

<p>The Future Trend of Literature and Art  Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>China's implementation of democracy is about to begin. Therefore, all facilities in China's politics, society, culture, education, etc., must be reformed and rebuilt. If we change the appearance but lack the substance, or cling to the old and seek temporary ease, not only will there be no progress, but we will also miss the opportunity and ruin the revival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Literature and art are the soul of a nation and should lead everything forward. They must not be bound or hindered by anything, and artists must not be made to feel inferior, deceive themselves, or be timid.</p>
<p>The mission of artists is to express their opinions to the fullest extent within the scope permitted by the constitution and, to the best of their ability, to enlighten people with foresight and awaken them with awareness. If they are even slightly hesitant, if they do not fully express what they know or fully convey their meaning, they would not only be ashamed to be artists but also ashamed to be democratic citizens. Even if something is not permitted by the constitution, artists, with their personal feelings or with a compassionate and fearless spirit, should loudly call for the people's suffering and raise the banner of revolution to change the application of the constitution. Such precedents are not only common in democratic countries, but also often seen under autocratic tyrants. In modern times, France had Zola, the United States had Lincoln, and China's Sun Yat-sen, from the Xinhai Revolution to the National Revolution, first had written calls and appeals, followed by political and social revolutionary movements, all of which are clear precedents.</p>
<p>Only by recognizing the importance of the mission of literature and art can we rebuild the fortress of literature and art. Literature and art, like religion, are majestic and solemn, truly sacred and inviolable. If we can respect and worship them and follow their rationality, they can be called all-encompassing and universally effective. Their efficacy is so broad, profound, and subtle that it is beyond our imagination. No matter how big or small the matter, they can be used at will and will be effective as long as we are absolutely obedient. The only requirement is that the user's motivation is selfless and impartial.</p>
<p>In the future, if we want literature and art to exert their greatest effect, we must first respect the objectivity of literature and art, just like religion, and not use temples to deceive the public and collect money. Authors should aim for the nation and the people, and readers should also abandon selfish and suspicious prejudices. Like a bright mirror or a clear spring, they should reflect social reality without any distortion. If everyone accepts it with an open mind, there will be new opportunities for reform in politics, society, culture, and education, and the national spirit will be rejuvenated. Only then can we truly be called a democratic country.</p>

<p>Ten thousand peaks fill the canvas with spring,</p>
<p>In my heart, there is ink, and my brush is free from dust;</p>
<p>In a bamboo sedan chair, I spend days ascending through the clouds,</p>
<p>Together, we become people on the top of Mount Emei.</p>
<p>Ferry  Zhou Shan</p>
<p>In the southwest, in that mountainous area, even a small stream can have times of rushing and surging! There are countless rapids and dangerous shoals: Yangjiao Shoal, Fubo Shoal, Lijia Mouth, and Ghost Gate Pass—what a thrilling scene!</p>
<p>During the hot summer, when mountain floods erupt and the river is full of water, the momentum is even more spectacular. The turbid river water, in the midst of ten thousand mountains, carries people, livestock, and fragments of shattered wooden boats at unparalleled speed, passing through piles of rocks, bypassing jagged mountain mouths, and rushing forward in a noisy and crowded manner! One vortex after another turns and sneers. The waves are like boiling water in a pot: below, hidden reefs rise and fall. On such a great river, those boatmen, those who live by the water, brave the severe cold or scorching heat every day, rowing a small boat, carrying a dozen passengers, back and forth. They have a skill that is more agile than water! They have a voice that is louder than water:</p>
<p>"Coming...? Going up to Wentan, Eryan, Baishatuo, Chengjiangkou!"</p>
<p>"Going...? Going down to Tangjiatuo, Baimiaozi, Tutuo...!"</p>
<p>Those rushing to board the boat with "bundles," "backpacks," "boxes," and "baskets" got on the boat one by one in response to the shouts. And another person walked to the dock, and the boatmen swarmed forward and surrounded him:</p>
<p>"Bearded one! This boat."</p>
<p>"Straw hat! Straw hat! Going to Eryan? That's right! Get on this boat."</p>
<p>"Bastard! How many people are you going to load?"</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch, you only loaded one boat yesterday, and you're trying to snatch again? Old man! We haven't loaded anyone for three days! Straw hat! Get on the boat."</p>
<p>"You ancestors, you haven't loaded anyone, that's your bad luck!"</p>
<p>The old man, nicknamed "Bearded one" and "Straw hat," put down his burden and wiped the sweat from his face with the corner of his clothes:</p>
<p>"I'm crossing the river."</p>
<p>The contention, insults, and hopes shattered and disappeared like glittering bubbles!</p>
<p>Urged by the crowd of passengers, the boat left the dock. But it did not leave immediately, but lingered on the river surface a dozen feet away from the shore, trying to wait for one or two more passengers who were traveling a long distance. Their gaze and eyes were full of expectation! Anxiety! Despair!</p>
<p>"Boss, are you taking us on a river tour?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you just go ashore and pull a few people onto the boat!"</p>
<p>"Guests, life is hard! It's only our turn every few days..."</p>
<p>Yes, who doesn't feel the pressure of life! Who isn't struggling on the edge of despair! What reason do we have to be harsh on him in the face of such a straightforward plea!</p>
<p>The setting sun turned the river water red, and the small boat was heading upstream. Downstream boats were like wind sweeping away the clouds, like shooting stars on a summer night, arriving in front of them in an instant. The helmsman greeted them:</p>
<p>"Brother Wang Wu, you're having a good time!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Brother Wang Wu and his assistant were fighting the rapids! These were two jagged rocks protruding from the river, and the boat had to pass through the gap between them! The water rushed down quickly, Wang Wu supported the oar with his right hand, grasped the long rudder with his left hand, braced his feet tightly against the cabin board, and leaned back slightly! And the assistant on the shore was prostrate on the beach, with a tow rope tied diagonally across his shoulder! He crawled like a dog!</p>
<p>Minute after minute passed, the river water was blocked by the small boat, and it became enraged: roaring, swirling, and rushing over with force, making the small boat tremble.</p>
<p>"Guests! Don't move!"</p>
<p>In just an instant, the small boat safely passed the dangerous passage!</p>
<p>"Bastards!"</p>
<p>"Push hard!"</p>
<p>Wang Wu's bronze-colored face was covered with sweat. The muscles on his arms bulged one by one: he rowed one oar after another! The young sailor on the bow was furious:</p>
<p>"Damn it! I've used all my strength;"</p>
<p>"Your old man's oar is just hitting the water!"</p>
<p>"Bastard, I..."</p>
<p>The boat approached the shore amidst the mutual cursing: a mountain mouth blocked the raging river! They put down their oars. Wang Wu lit a cheap cigarette, took a few deep puffs, and asked the guest to pass it to the young sailor: they reconciled!</p>
<p>A little further away, twenty or thirty trackers were dragging a heavy cargo ship upstream:</p>
<p>"Yo! Yo! Yo! Hey... Yo!"</p>
<p>The heavy shouts seemed to be sorrowful sighs uttered from the depths of the earth!</p>
<p>In the sunset glow of the evening, the small boat docked at the pier. While Wang Wu was receiving the passengers' fares, he shouted in a rising and falling tone:</p>
<p>"Guests! Take care of your belongings!"</p>

<p>Preface to the Trial Publication of the Literary Magazine Edited by the Shanghai Literary Writers Association  Wang Jinshan</p>
<p>A trial publication! It is not a founding; it is an attempt to found; or some may say: it is also a founding.</p>
<p>A founding, as usual, has words; how can a trial publication have no words, hence writing a preface to the trial publication.</p>
<p>Our association has no economic foundation, no allocated paper, and no printing equipment: originally, it did not have the conditions to publish a periodical. Yet, why do we want to publish a periodical? That is because the association's constitution stipulates that it should publish a periodical; members demand it, needing to publish a periodical: and, observing the current environment, it is even more necessary to publish a periodical.</p>
<p>Reason one is that the association's constitution stipulates that the association's mission is to seek the development of literary and artistic undertakings, the introduction and publication of members' works, and the connection of writers, etc. Therefore, it should publish a periodical.</p>
<p>Reason two is that the members of the association all take engaging in literary writing and literary work as their duty. In order to publish works and exchange opinions, on the day of the association's founding last year, they jointly demanded the publication of a periodical. Therefore, it is necessary to publish a periodical.</p>
<p>Reason three is that literature and art are the reflection of the times and the spiritual food of the masses. At present, not only is the publication of general literary books and periodicals withering and declining, but some are simply using literary forms to engage in propaganda that undermines the interests of the country and the nation, acting as accomplices to the new feudal forces. Some even continue the enslaved literary style of the enemy-puppet period, regressing the content and consciousness of their works to before the May Fourth Movement, anesthetizing the souls of readers; representing the dying embers of the old feudal forces. In addition, there are many authors who are drunk and dreaming of death, and, like the previous two types of people, also disregard the trends of the times and are out of touch with reality, regarding themselves as celebrities, indulging in self-intoxication, chanting about the wind and moon, and not knowing what they are saying. The above not only fails to live up to the sanctity of literature and art, and tarnishes the dignity of writers; but it is also absurd and ridiculous, and ultimately creates a spiritual famine for the masses. Therefore, to adapt to the needs of the objective environment, it is even more necessary to publish a periodical.</p>
<p>Therefore, after repeated resolutions by the board of directors and the standing committee, we resolutely decided to prepare a purely literary monthly magazine in order to accept the demands of members, meet the needs of readers, and fulfill the mission of the association, and achieve the association's purpose.</p>
<p>Some words have already been said in the association's founding declaration, and it is still worthwhile to repeat them—</p>
<p>As literary writers who are spiritual technicians, it seems that they should first bear the responsibility of spiritual education, be loyal to literature and art, be loyal to life experiences, be loyal to the freedom of writing; and jointly establish new writing beliefs and new literary styles. — This was the motivation for the organization of the association a year ago, and it has become the common belief of the members over the past year; today, a year later, under this common belief, the trial issue of this publication was born; with the birth of the trial issue, the future goals of this publication have also been established;</p>
<p>First, promote national literature and art</p>
<p>Second, create literature and art of the times</p>
<p>Third, promote literary and artistic construction</p>
<p>Fourth, improve the level of literature and art</p>
<p>Before these four goals, this publication will not only shake hands with established writers who have been writing for decades but also shake hands with young friends who are eager to learn and have a bright future. We oppose sectarianism and have no prejudices. This publication will not only serve as a publication shared by members, but we also hope that all comrades across the country who are loyal to literature and art will regard it as a public garden for literature and art.</p>
<p>Today, we respectfully meet readers with a trial attitude, and especially sincerely await readers' guidance and assistance.</p>
<p>Recent World Literary Scene Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Psychological Novelist Proust</p>
<p>Recently, Justin O'Brien talked about the great French psychological novelist Marcel Proust in the New York Times Book Review, roughly saying: Twenty-six years ago, on November 18, 1922, Proust died in Paris. It is said that he knew that his death was approaching, and instructed his loyal servant Celeste to hand over his unfinished manuscript to him, which was the section describing the death of the novelist Bergotte. In his last moments of suffering, Proust added a section, the final conclusion of which was: "They buried him, but in the bright windows, throughout the night of mourning, his books were arranged three by three, as if angels had spread their wings, seemingly a symbol of his resurrection, although he was already dead."</p>
<p>The imaginary novelist Bergotte created by Proust mostly symbolized himself "not completely dead". He did think of himself. His own masterpiece "In Search of Lost Time" has been published in ten volumes. It was not until five years after his death that the final part of this great work was published.</p>
<p>According to his theory, the "past" does not die, but it also does not exist faithfully, like a charcoal drawing, but rather as a flying impression of consciousness. In the first few volumes, he narrated the story of Swann falling in love with a worthless Odette. He used lengthy passages to analyze the psychology of love and jealousy, included in "Swann's Way". He also narrated homosexual love in "Cities of the Plain".</p>
<p>Proust's death at the age of fifty-one seems particularly unfortunate. Of the three veterans of French literature at the same time as him, two were older than him, Claudel and Gide, were still alive and continued to write; Paul Valery, who was younger than him, continued to write until his death in 1945. If he were still alive, he should have had even greater achievements. Even if he could not produce other works, he could at least revise his great work more completely. Many manuscripts had not been revised by him. In 1913, Proust revised a 1,500-page manuscript into 4,000 pages. This ratio is terrible. If he had lived to be seventy years old, his masterpiece must have been greatly revised.</p>
<p>The period from Proust's death in 1922 to the publication of the final volume of his masterpiece in 1927 was the peak of his reputation. His works have been translated into various languages.</p>
<p>Shortly after Proust's death, poems and short stories published in 1896 were reprinted and published. In 1927, his occasional magazine articles were also compiled and published. There were also several researchers who compiled indexes for his novels. And there were several researchers who wrote biographies for him.</p>
<p>In 1940, a young American scholar, D. W. Alden, studied Proust and found a total of 1,700 articles of various lengths from 1913 to 1938. The topics discussed varied, some talking about music, painting, memory, Jews, high society, etc., and others talking about style, aesthetic structure, impressionism, and the application of lessons, etc.</p>
<p>Proust's death gave researchers a lot of material, some talking about the geography in his novels, and others talking about the impact of asthma on his works. At the same time, the publication of Proust's seven volumes of letters also provided convenience for research. However, these letters were quite unfavorable to Proust, showing that the author was very selfish, too snobbish, and insincere, completely disproportionate to the broad spirit of his works. Reviewers also felt that Proust only wrote about high society, which was inevitably narrow in scope.</p>
<p>Now fewer people know Proust, because, first, his works are now not easily available; second, people do not have the leisure to read such a large work; third, what he wrote about are the leisure classes, which are disliked by modern youth. But he is still worthy of commemoration, his psychological analysis, his keen observation, and his delicate writing are all commendable.</p>
<p>He said at the end of his masterpiece: "Undoubtedly, my book, like me, will eventually die one day. But one should abandon the idea of death. We acknowledge that the bones after ten years, and the paintings after a hundred years, no longer exist. The immortality of books and people is not an easy thing." We hope that his works will one day be able to be resurrected and receive universal recognition and appreciation.</p>
<p>Hesse's Demian</p>
<p>Swiss writer Hermann Hesse won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. Twenty-eight years ago, he wrote a novel "Demian". In the early 1920s, World War I was still a traumatic experience, reason seemed to have gone bankrupt, and Freud's exploration, in the eyes of some people, was enough to prove that the old truths were inappropriate. This novel had a deep impact on the young intellectual class in Europe, and even had an impact in the United States.</p>
<p>It stirred readers with its revolutionary attitude towards good and evil, it predicted general insight (Demian said: "The world as it is now should die, should perish, and must die."), it refused to use old ways of thinking and acting, and was almost inhumane. The individual is higher than society, and fate is higher than maxims. One of the characters in the book said: "His only wish is to let fate do its thing. He has no relatives, stands alone, only cold space surrounds him."</p>
<p>Looking at it today, the story in "Demian" is not very new, but it is still fresh. The story begins in 1890 and ends in 1914, narrating the childhood and adolescence of Emil Sinclair.</p>
<p>The first half of the book is a brilliant record of student life experience. He was enslaved by swindling bullies, and was also a slave to Demian. Demian became his angel and devil. He gradually understood the difference between the dark world (the unknowable and unspeakable) and the bright world (the knowable and speakable). This half is written fresh, solid and clever.</p>
<p>The life in the second half of the book is richer and stranger than the first half. Symbolic dreams and paintings, news and revelries in the basement of the chapel, and outstanding relationships form a thread of self and fate. The light of the story gradually becomes eerie, leaving only the heat and flash of the early years.</p>
<p>Free Talk "Daylight Saving Time" Wu Yong</p>
<p>"Daylight Saving Time," also known as "Daylight Saving Time." The author has done some thinking on these two names, and after thinking, could not understand them, so he further asked friends for advice. After asking for advice, he was still not very satisfied with his friends' explanations. Thinking that this system may have originated in the West, he checked the dictionary. The author is a poor scholar and does not have many dictionaries. He is also ashamed of not being able to "master several languages", so he had to check the English dictionary. After checking, he found that the term "Daylight Saving Time" was not available in older dictionaries. Only in a newly published English-Chinese dictionary did he find the term "Daylight-saving time." According to its annotation, this plan originated in the United States, which is "Daylight Saving Time." The method is to "set the clock one hour ahead of standard time, starting in early summer; and set it back one hour in autumn." The author already knew this. What I am looking for is not the meaning of this system, but the purpose of this system, but the dictionary does not have a detailed explanation of this point.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy also implemented "Daylight Saving Time" in the occupied areas during the transition from spring to summer. At that time, many people suspected that this was "Tokyo Time", so they felt "not surprised". However, even today, there must be many people like the author who do not understand the purpose of this method. We want to ask: What are the benefits of implementing this method and setting the clock forward one hour?</p>
<p>The so-called "setting the clock forward one hour" means that if the original standard time is 8:00 am, then according to Daylight Saving Time, it is 9:00 am. If the office hours of people working in offices in the city are from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, then they should get up one hour earlier than the standard time to go to the office, and they can get off work one hour earlier than the original time in the afternoon. Getting up one hour earlier in the morning can be compensated for by going to bed one hour earlier at night, so it doesn't matter; getting off work one hour earlier in the afternoon provides many conveniences for handling personal affairs. Because when you walk out of the office, you look up and see that the sky is still early, and there are still three or four hours before dark, so you can visit relatives and friends, or wander around the streets, or at least go home early to rest. But this is only for personal convenience. If it is only for this point, I think it is not necessary to implement Daylight Saving Time and order the whole country to comply.</p>
<p>Some say that the implementation of Daylight Saving Time is to make people across the country work one hour more. In other words, those who used to work eight hours now have to work nine hours, that is, office hours are brought forward one hour, and the time for getting off work is not brought forward. This intention is originally very good, but in fact, it is not necessarily done this way. Secondly, even if you want to ask people to work one hour more, you can extend office hours by one hour, so why bother setting the clock forward one hour?</p>
<p>Some say that setting the clock forward one hour means getting off work one hour earlier, and the intention is to save electricity. This statement does not match the facts. There is a saying among Chinese people: "The lungs should sleep on the night of the Winter Solstice, and play on the day of the Summer Solstice." This means that the winter nights are long and the days are short, while the summer days are long and the nights are short. As far as China's geographical location on the earth is concerned, this is indeed the case. In winter, it is already dusk at 5:00 pm, while in summer, although it is almost 7:00 pm according to standard time, the sky is still not dark. It can be seen that the implementation of Daylight Saving Time is at least irrelevant to saving electricity in our country. Moreover, in terms of the length of days and nights, it is more reasonable to implement this "Daylight Saving Time" method in winter, because this can avoid the disadvantage of the sky being dark when getting off work at 5:00 pm, and it can indeed achieve the practical effect of saving electricity.</p>
<p>The author's mind is simple and his knowledge is limited. After thinking about it, he really can't figure out the purpose of "Daylight Saving Time". Of course, the disadvantages of implementing "Daylight Saving Time" are probably non-existent.</p>
<p>Doubts upon Doubts Mao Yi</p>
<p>I read a strange story in the newspaper about a bird carrying a lit cigarette to its nest, which burned down the nest and caused a fire in the house under the eaves, resulting in a loss of one hundred and fifty yuan. The newspaper's report ends there. But this seems to leave a big void for me. (Editor's note: Please refer to the article "Coincidence" published in this publication on April 30.)</p>
<p>Countless questions welled up in my heart, the first of which was naturally: What exactly happened? Did the bird want to warm its nest with the cigarette butt? What kind of cigarette was it? How did the bird get it? Did it peck it from the smoker's mouth, hand, or ashtray? If it belonged to the latter and the ashtray was in the room, how did the bird fly in? And how did it fly out?</p>
<p>Does the bird smoke like ordinary people? Or did it just hold it in its mouth? Did any passers-by see it flying by with a cigarette in its mouth? Did it sincerely want to burn down the nest? Burn down the house it depended on? Did it hate the landlord? Did it mistake the cigarette butt for a hot worm? Or a firefly? Does this prove that it is nearsighted? Or is it just stupid?</p>
<p>If its cigarette butt was snatched from a person's mouth or hand, what was the reaction of the person who was snatched? Anger? Shock? What did he, or she, do? Did they exclaim "Hey"? Or did they pounce on the bird? Or did they light another cigarette and say; "I bet that stupid bird is going to throw the cigarette butt into its nest and cause a fire that costs one hundred and fifty dollars"?</p>
<p>I am sorry to be so curious here, but Voltaire, or Oscar Wilde, or perhaps another great writer once said: "Asking the right questions that even you cannot answer is a great thing." If so, I may be doing well. (Written by Party)</p>
<p>An Opportunity Mei Bai</p>
<p>The National Games have opened. Our China seems to have become a country that is best at holding meetings, but this meeting is full of vitality and different from others—it will neither make all kinds of jokes in order to canvass votes, nor will it pass countless resolutions that specialize in writing current affairs clichés and consider it a complete success. In this respect, the National Games should indeed be the most "clean" meeting.</p>
<p>But we cannot ignore the significance of the National Games from another perspective. In today's turbulent times, judging from the enthusiastic participation of representatives from remote provinces and overseas Chinese, the National Games can very well play a role in increasing "centripetal force".</p>
<p>If the government wants to make "the world submit", this is an opportunity. However, if this opportunity is not well utilized, what could have been "the world submitting" may change into "widespread grievances", thus producing very serious consequences. Therefore, the people who are in charge of this National Games have a considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the overseas Chinese units that returned to participate this time are attending the National Games for the first time. In this eventful time for the motherland, they do not hesitate to travel long distances to return and share the grand event. How should we warmly receive them to express our concern for distant people! But in fact, after the athletes from Taiwan and Xinjiang entered the dormitory, the National Games authorities never even sent a staff member to take care of them! According to what I know for sure, on the first night after the athletes from Taiwan entered, they were tired from the journey and urgently needed to rest. No one greeted them in the dormitory, so they had to move their bedding and prepare to sleep on their own; but at this time, the owner of the dormitory suddenly declared that this large room was not included in the dormitory and asked the athletes to move out immediately! Finally, it was only after repeated requests from the person in charge of the Taiwan delegation that they were temporarily allowed to stay overnight. The next day, the athletes had to carry their bedding and move again on their own! The compatriots from Taiwan never said a word of complaint, and they were considerate of the National Games everywhere. I don't know what excuses the National Games authorities will come up with, but we only feel ashamed—because we ordinary people would never be so rude to a brother returning from afar: in a time of widespread war, when we reunite after a long separation, we should have a good time talking about it. I will use everything I have to welcome him. How can I be indifferent to him at first and then drive him out in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>If the person in charge of the National Games clearly understands the righteousness and is aware of the importance of his responsibility, he should always come out with the frank spirit of a mobilizer and resolutely apologize to the athletes from Taiwan!</p>
<p>We cannot allow a "clean" meeting to leave any slight stains, we cannot lightly let go of any opportunity to strive for "centripetal force"—we should even more give play to the spirit of friendship and generosity of our country's tradition!</p>
<p>A Trap Lei Ying</p>
<p>When I was young, I read martial arts novels such as Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, and I was often fascinated by the many "mechanisms" for catching people, such as "Chongxiao Thread" and "Copper Net Array", and felt that they were mysterious and unpredictable, and very interesting.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, today I saw a piece of news in an American publication and discovered an inventor who specializes in installing "news" and "mechanisms". He is W. Moore from Carlo, Michigan, USA. He has recently installed all the "mechanisms" in his house. No matter how great your skills are, if you break into this house at night, you will not be able to escape!</p>
<p>These "mechanisms" are like this: as soon as a stranger enters, the "mechanism" is activated, and all the lights in the house immediately turn on, the doors of every room are automatically locked, and at the same time, the telephone bureau also receives a warning call, and the police bells in the police station ring loudly!</p>
<p>Mr. Moore is waiting for a burglar to come, but unfortunately, his wish has not yet been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Two Painters in Six Chapters of a Floating Life</p>
<p>Six Chapters of a Floating Life has been promoted by Lin Yutang and Yu Pingbo, and brought to the stage and the screen. People south of the Yangtze River almost all know Shen Sanbai. Yu Pingbo said: "The wonderful thing about this book is not that it is vividly similar, but that it achieves vivid similarity without any effort; the beautiful thing about it is not that it is beautiful, but that it seems to have nothing else besides beauty. It is like a pure crystal, only seeing the crystal clear, not seeing the color that sets off the crystal clear; only seeing the subtle, not seeing the traces of making the subtle." The argument is pertinent. To focus solely on the excellence of the article is short-sighted. Is Sanbai also a heartbroken person throughout the ages? If the virtuous couple had lived to old age together, how could this Six Chapters have been written? "Idle Sentiments" records three painters in Xiaoshuang Tower, who are famous painters from the Wu region. The following is a brief biography of the three painters for readers' reference:</p>
<p>Yang Changxu, style name Bufan, sobriquet Fenghuangshan Ren, a native of Changzhou, a national student, good at landscape painting, with a rich and elegant style. He once went to Miao territory, fully appreciating the strange and beautiful scenery. Later, he was a guest at Ruan Yuan's Langhuan Xianguan, traveling with various celebrities, and his painting skills improved. The scholars and women imitated Liu Ru, with an elegant and rhythmic style.</p>
<p>Yuan Pei, style name Shaoyu, Yuezi, his landscape paintings are clear, plump, elegant and beautiful, and he is especially famous in the capital, and his calligraphy is rounded.</p>
<p>Wang Yan, style name Xinglan, a top student of Miao Chun, his flower paintings are meticulous, and his birds and animals are lifelike. (Wu Wenxun)</p>
<p>Writers' Anecdotes Jin Lin</p>
<p>Alexandre Dumas, the author of "The Three Musketeers", which shook the world, could not write novels without blue paper, could not write poetry without yellow paper, and if he wanted to write a short essay, he had to use rose-colored paper.</p>
<p>He never used blue ink. And when he wrote plays, he had to lie on the sofa with a soft pillow under his elbow to get inspiration.</p>
<p>H.G. Wells suffered a serious injury from being trampled on while working as a soccer referee. He lived a painful life for twelve years, but he also became a world-renowned celebrity because of this.</p>
<p>He did not have a fixed place to write. He would write in his London office, in his car, or on the Mediterranean coast. And when a thought suddenly came to his mind, he would immediately write it down in his notebook.</p>
<p>Sleeping Too Much Is Not Beneficial He Dao</p>
<p>Many people think that if their bodies are unwell, they should sleep more. However, according to the results of recent research by several authoritative medical circles, sleeping too much is not only not beneficial, but it can even cause other problems! British medical authority Dr. Asher recently warned doctors: "Before we tell patients to sleep, we must consider carefully; we must know that although soft bedding is quite comfortable, the harm of sleeping too much is quite terrible."</p>
<p>Dr. Asher said that sleeping too much can cause lung disease, or make the original lung disease worse. It can also make skin diseases more serious, can make muscles gradually lose their mobility, can cause joint pain, and can also cause kidney disease, stomach disease, heart disease, and nervous disorders.</p>
<p>For example, when a person is lying in bed, of course, they will not move much, and they will often maintain the same posture. This can cause the secretions in the body's glands to collect in the trachea, which can easily lead to insomnia. If a person has lung disease, after lying in bed, because there is no exercise, the amount of breathing is reduced, and the diseased lungs are not easy to recover.</p>
<p>But Dr. Asher believes that the most terrible thing is the impact of sleeping too much on blood vessels. The reduction in muscle movement slows down blood circulation due to lack of stimulation, which can cause the blood to clot, which can cause blood vessels to become inflamed—this is a fatal condition. Medical scientists have studied patients with this type of blood clot disease and found that 53% of the patients had been bedridden for a long time.</p>
<p>After sleeping too much, the movement of the bones is greatly reduced, and if the bones are not moved, the calcium in the bones will slowly flow away, which is especially dangerous for the elderly. This calcium often flows into the kidneys, so the amount of calcium in the urine increases, which can easily cause kidney stones. There is also a terrible condition that is easy to cause: urinary retention.</p>
<p>Sleeping too much can also easily cause constipation and liver and stomach pain, which are dangerous for the elderly. And the dust raised when folding bedding in bed is even more harmful to the lungs.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Asher also solemnly declared that he is not simply opposed to patients sleeping. Sleeping can indeed be beneficial to treatment, but you must not sleep too much. He believes that "sleeping" is like other drugs, and should be prescribed by a doctor, allowing the doctor to decide whether you need to sleep and how long you should sleep. (Translator's note: Dr. Asher's original name is D.R.A.J. Asher, and this article is taken from an article published by Asher in the British Medical Journal.)</p>
<p>Jin Hui's father, Prince Su Shanqi of the Qing Dynasty, was granted the hereditary title of nobility for his meritorious service in the early Qing Dynasty, the so-called "Iron Hat Prince". By the end of the Qing Dynasty, he was a distant branch. In the old capital, there were many such princes and nobles, and no one paid attention to them. However, Shanqi was appointed Minister of Civil Affairs because he knew about the new policies and was aware of current affairs. This was because the Qing court suddenly realized the need to promote reform after the Boxer Rebellion. Among the imperial clan nobles, many were ignorant, but Shanqi was the first to understand the trend and had long studied it. He also sent his children to study in Japan, and thus stood out among the nobles. He was also very fond of elegance, and put his heart into calligraphy, painting, and opera. He could perform martial arts operas and was a good friend of the martial artist Yu Zhenting. His calligraphy was painstakingly learned from Liu Shi'an, and his colleague Wu Zhen (Vice Minister of Civil Affairs) had it printed into a small booklet and asked the famous Hanlin scholar Xu Huanong (Qi) to write a title and poems for it. Shanqi himself titled it "Imitation of Liu Wenqing Gong", and also titled it, "Named imitation, but in reality, it is not similar." He really had self-awareness. Liu Yong's calligraphy, "cotton with needles inside", was not easy to learn, and scholars often made it bloated, clumsy, ugly.

Those attending included Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhu Jingnong, Ye Suzhong, Yu Wen, Wang Jin　, Yan Duhhe, Ma Gongyu, Xu Weinan, Xu Zhongnian, and over ten thousand people from cultural and literary circles, with Pan Gongzhan serving as the general chairman. After the meeting began, Pan delivered a speech, stating that the May Fourth Movement was a deep-rooted patriotic movement that manifested the spirit of democracy in politics and created a new cultural movement in culture. The slogan at the time was "Science and Democracy," but after nearly thirty years, the achievements in science and democracy are still unsatisfactory. Therefore, cultural circles commemorating the May Fourth Movement should work together to awaken society's attention to science to seek creation and development. In terms of democracy, although China currently has democratic forms, the promotion of democracy lies in the spirit of democracy, that is, the expression of accommodating opinions and making decisions by the majority. He hoped that people in cultural circles would work hard to promote it. Fang Zhi then spoke about the historical significance and value of the May Fourth Movement. Zhu Jingnong spoke about the gains of the May Fourth New Cultural Movement. Luo Dunwei and Yi Junzuo successively spoke about the achievements of the May Fourth Movement in reforming Chinese literature and art.

Then the Kunlun Company's new film "New Grievances" was screened. After the meeting, a literary and art gathering and cocktail party were held at the Literary and Art Lounge.

<p>Regarding the "Charles M. Yerkes" oil tanker, on which a large quantity of opium and corpses were found, the Ministry of the Interior and the Opium Prohibition Committee telegraphed the customs to request that the ship be detained. It is understood that the ship hurriedly left Shanghai for Hong Kong the other day and sailed directly to the Bulungan area of Borneo. According to sources concerned, the captain of the ship claimed that the smuggling of opium was carried out by two deceased Chinese sailors. After research and investigation by the Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau and the Police Bureau, it was unanimously believed that the two poor sailors definitely did not have the resources to independently manage this unprecedentedly large quantity of drugs. The evidence is lacking regarding the poisoning deaths of the two sailors in the water tank, and there was a lack of material evidence during the burial at sea.</p>

The items in the deceased's room were not scientifically investigated. It is necessary to conduct a reinvestigation of the case to find out the truth. The authorities are currently trying to send a telegram to relevant overseas parties to detain the ship and escort it to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Demanding Same Treatment as Provincial Middle Schools in the Wuhan Area</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Hankou, 4th] Teachers in five provincial middle schools, including Huanggang, Guangji, Qichun, and Tianmen, have gone on strike for one week starting yesterday to fight for the same treatment as provincial middle schools in the Wuhan area. According to a person in educational circles, this action is purely to urge the education authorities to make fair adjustments, and there are no other opinions. Therefore, the responsible authorities here are very calm about this.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Municipal Education Bureau Orders Each District to Investigate and Report on Students Who Have Dropped Out of School at the Primary and Secondary Levels <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] Regarding the measures to aid unemployed youth in this city, in addition to holding unified scholarships in conjunction with various groups, the Education Bureau is providing assistance to prevent students from dropping out of school. It has also set a limit of 25% free places in public and private schools, and all poor students can apply for free education to reduce the number of unemployed youth. Fearing that poor students may still be missing out, the Education Bureau has prepared a form and ordered all district offices to investigate and report, and announced that unemployed students at the primary and secondary levels in the city should register with their respective district offices for the purpose of clarifying the actual situation and providing remedies, so as to ensure that all unemployed youth in the city have the opportunity to attend school. The Social Affairs Bureau is separately handling the aid to unemployed youth.</p>
