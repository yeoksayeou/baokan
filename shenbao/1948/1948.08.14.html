<h3>麥帥夫婦明飛漢城　參加韓國政府成立典禮　南韓境內美軍繼續留駐</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城十三日電〕此間美軍總部今宣布，麥帥夫婦已接受李承晚總統之邀請，參加十五日之韓國新政府就職典禮，麥帥定當日自東京乘機蒞此，典禮畢後即乘原機返日。麥帥於致李氏之覆信中云：「愚夫婦見邀訪韓，衷心愉快，親與貴國自由誕生之盛會，實屬莫大榮幸，且此一盛舉亦定將博得每一美國人士內心愉快之共鳴也。又此盛典亦爲先生數十年來不屈奮鬥之偉大成功之說明，茲先敬致最誠懇之賀忱」。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕美國今日已於事實上承認韓國政府，且任命總錫俄爲大使衛駐漢城特別代表。美國務院之聲明中稱：漢城之韓國政府，乃按聯合國大會一九四七年十一月十四日之議決案而組成者，故應被認爲韓國之政府，並希望在北韓卅八度以北之韓國人民，能於適當時期內，自由參加此一政府。國務院官員對南京方面所傳中國當局暫行承認漢城政府一事，拒加評論，而謂美國已將其此一行動，吿知聯合國赴韓代表團中之八國，即中，澳，菲，叙，印，加，法，薩爾瓦多以及開羅宣言簽字國英國。美國並已將此舉電吿刻在漢城之聯合國赴韓代表團圑長，至於原被推舉爲赴韓代表團團員，而拒未前往之烏克蘭代表，尚未獲通知。國務院發言人繼謂：繆錫俄乃職業外交家，渠曾先後在上海，香港，福州及昆明美領事館工作八年餘，繆氏刻在美國西岸，即將摒擋赴漢城。（美國務院聲明全文刊第三版）</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十二日電〕政府官員十二日預料稱：美軍將繼續留駐韓南，直至韓南新政府認爲其足够强盛抵制任何共產黨政變之企圖。蘇聯現仍佔領韓北，官員稱：撤退韓境美佔領軍之政策，將在與韓南政府總統李承晚之談判中決定之。美政府已於十二日晚正式承認此一政府爲「朝鮮政府」，但一個反對之「左派」政府於本月中在韓北即將選出，此使朝鮮境內將有一個蘇聯所承認之韓北政府，一個美國所承認之韓南政府。而此兩個政府皆自稱爲朝鮮人民說話。此一從日本支配下獲得解放僅歷三年之多難國家，將於本年九月中在巴黎聯合國大會中提出。李承晚總統十二日談稱：根據目下情形，渠要求美軍無限期留駐朝鮮。惟在六個月之前，李氏猶要求美駐韓佔領軍立即撤退。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城十三日電〕中·英·美三國之開羅宣言，約定允許韓國獨立，三國中之中國，對八月十五日成立之韓國政府臨時承認，中國照會十三日晚七時零五分由駐韓大使衛代表劉馭萬送交李承晚總統。一般人士預料，菲律賓將步中國之後亦予以臨時承認·李總統稱：中國首先支持大韓民國新政府，渠對蔣總統及王外長之五好，表示深切感荷，數百年來中·韓兩國非僅互相友好，且爲兄弟之邦，故中·韓兩遠東國家理應互相提携，以促進和平與繫榮·李氏又稱：希望中·韓兩國可彼此相助，解決共產黨問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城十三日電〕代表國民外交協會及中國天主敎文化協進會，參與朝鮮政府成立大</p>
<h3>張羣訪日頗屬可能　我駐日代表團尚未接消息</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕我駐日代表圑長商震稱：迄今渠尚未由我國政府方面接獲有關所傳前任行政院長張羣即將訪日之消息，但張氏之訪日，頗屬可能。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十二日電〕據此間政治觀察家評論中英美兵三國承認漢城政府一事，謂自戰爭終止以來，中國政府明確立於西方列強方面，而對遠東重大問題毅然作決，等於直接反對蘇聯之觀點，此猶爲初次。消息靈通方面稱，張羣不久赴韓後，將赴日本，或尚將赴印尼與緬甸，張氏在韓將與南韓總理李範爽會談，李氏定本月十五日就職，而北韓蘇佔區則定本月二十五日舉行普選，張氏在日時將與主要各政黨領袖會談，或將謁見麥克阿瑟將軍與日皇裕仁，某數方面之意，張氏赴日之主要目標，乃在接洽麥克阿瑟將軍與蔣總統會晤事，張氏旅行期大釣有一月之久，然後或將赴美國與美政府當局協商美國援華事宜，惟據政府方面聲稱：張氏並禾奉有正式使命。</p>
<h3>美援雙方聯度座談會　花紗交換率決定　糧食石油運用亦獲協議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕美援運用委員會與美經濟合作總署駐華分署，十三日下午三時在行政院一號官舍舉行第三次聯合座談會，我出席者有美援運用委會委員俞鴻鈞，俞大維，王雲五，王世杰（董霖代），嚴家淦及李幹，沈熙瑞，吳學蘭等。美方出席者有賴樸翰，吉爾白屈克，顧希伯等十餘人，我糧食部長關吉玉亦應邀參加，由兼主委翁文灝主席，除報吿最近業務外，關於美援物資之運用，雙方協議三點如下：（一）關於棉花者，對於棉花小組決定之八項分配原則（見後）表示接受，關於棉花與棉紗之交換比例，規定每包棉紗交換五九九磅棉花，棉花以八分之七英吋不特林美棉爲標準，棉紗以廿支出口棉紗爲標準，以第一期美援棉花爲限，其執行之機構，美方意見希望必須由美經合署駐華分暑與美援運用委會共同辦理。（二）關於糧食者，美援糧食除供應五大都市參加配售外，因靑島情形特殊，而附近糧源阻塞，對靑島亦決定儘量供應。（三）關於石油者，決定供應公用事業，其價格由美援運用委會與美經合署駐華分署兩機構指定人員研究決定，至五時散會。</p>
<p>棉花小組會議所決定之棉花分配八項原則，簡言之即（三）美援棉花之分配，專爲紡廿支或更細棉紗之用，（二）在可能範圍內，原棉應在同一基礎之下交換棉紗或棉布，但如紗廠無現成之棉紗或棉布時，分配機構仍可配給棉花再由廠方於一定時間（即製造所需之時間）內，交出棉紗或棉布。（三）分配美援棉花以紗廠棉花供應不足兩月之用者爲限，每次分配不得超過各該廠一月之所需，惟各該廠內剩餘之棉花不計算在內。（四）優級長纖維之棉花，應分配與有工具利用之工廠，其紡成之棉紗或棉布，無論內銷，外銷，品質均須合於援棉分配機構所定之標準。（五）工廠接受美援棉花分配後，應即製成棉紗或布，不得以配得之棉花出售。（六）所有援棉分配，均在進口港之貨倉中提貨，交換之紗或布，亦應在同一海港貨倉中進行。（七）每一工廠分配之總數，由此一工廠開工時之紗錠及一切紡織美棉之紗錠比例而定。（八）各廠申請分配棉花時，可用書面向棉花小組由請。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕美援物資出售後款項之運用問題，十三日下午聯合座談會中尚未提出討論，俟數字有籍確統計後再行討論。惟會外之交換意見，現尚在進行中。</p>
<h3>蕎麥空運瀋陽</h3>
<p>美援小麥續抵天津</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十三日電〕美經濟合作總署中國分署十三日起由平陸續空運九十六噸之蕎麥來瀋作爲種籽，配發受災農民，以謀補救遼陽一帶所受蚜虫之災害。東北政委會農田水利處今晨曾召業有關方面，研商分配辦法。</p>

<h3>京滬等廿餘都市商埠　財部禁新設行荘　準設區域決提高資本額</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕財部爲控制信用，管制金融，以達到穩定經濟之目的起見，除將整頓金融機構及檢查行莊外，對於今後行莊之設立，已決定予以嚴格之限制，財部各要員運日研商結果，對於限制今後新設行荘問題，意見已完全一致，咸主張自今日起應做到事實上不再有任何新行莊之設立，惟方法上則從限制設立區域及提高資本額入手，根據此項重要原則，其執行之具體辦法及實施細則，亦正在研擬中，不日即可定案，提出政務會議討論通過實施。該辦法之內容將包括兩大要點，一爲限制設立之區域，規定除內地及邊遠各省市外，在全國各大都市及大商埠絕對禁止新設行莊。一爲提高新設行莊之資本額，凡在內地及邊遠省市新設行莊者，其資本額應達到戰前資本額之標準。依新辦法之規定，全國各大都市商埠如滬·京·平·津·漢·穗·靑·濟·渝·蓉·昆·杭·甬·紹·潯及長沙·西安·南昌·溫州·蘇州·瀋陽等二十餘處，在任何條件之下，均不許再新設行莊。至其他各省與內地及過遠各省准設行莊區域，提高資本額之辦法，係按照戰前行莊之資本額，定爲基數，再按照現在之京·滬區公教從員生活指數折合法幣計算銀行之最高基數爲五十萬元，其次爲二十萬元，銀號之基數最低者爲五萬元，生活指數以設立時之當月生活指數爲準，舉例言之，七月份之京，滬區生活指數爲一六零萬倍，則基數應爲五十萬元之銀行，其資本額即須八千億元，始准設立，而商業銀行之附設實業部，儲信部者，每附設一部時，其資本額即應較原定之資本額增加二分之一。據悉：此項限制新設行莊，提高行莊資本額辦法之擬訂，係過去由財部所提出，曾提出政務會議討論，嗣交由全經會審查，惟後因全經會結束擱置，以迄於今。最近財部曾數次向政院請示辦法，政院數日前因令財部從速另擬訂新辦法，財部奉令後，乃集合數要員詳加研討。經確定上項原則，並正根據此原則擬訂具體辦法，俟定案後，即可提出政務會議討論，在整頓行莊聲中，財部各首長對於嚴格限制新設行荘，均有執行之決心。</p>
<h3>加對華關稅減讓表　茶葉類外均無變動</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕工商部息：關於加拿大對我所允關稅减讓之實施情形，外交部電飭駐加大使館調查。茲據該館電稱，即向加政府國稅部及有關各司洋行洽杳，所得結果爲加拿大所允給與我國之關稅减讓表內，除由生長及出產國進口或自英國或其他屬地購買之「二八〇」項茶葉關稅更減爲每磅二分，及「二九A」項其他茶葉枉一九四七年十一月十八日頒布之緊急時期外匯保存法下禁止進口外，其餘各項商品之關稅减議均照表實施。</p>

<h3>學費·教師生活·教育制度</h3>
<p>本市教育當局邀請公私立校長，教職員代表，學生家長旣教育界知名之士數十人，在今天舉行座談會，各就本身的立場，對於下學期學費標準問題，儘量發表意見，雖不作任何決議，但當可供教育當局決定下學期收費標準的參攷。</p>
<p>暑假轉瞬凈盡，三十七年度第一學期即將開始，公私學校的學費問題，不僅為有子女入學的家長所關切，而且凡是關心下一代教育人人士，也無不希望教育當局能夠規定一個比較合理的標準。我們願乘座談會舉行之際，一述我們對於這個問題的意見。</p>
<p>在百物飛漲漫無止境的今天，除了少數豪富而外，上海天多數的家庭，無不受高物價的壓迫而感到生活的威脅。他們對於子女的教育，根本就無力負擔，聽到下學期的收費將以食米爲標準，家長莫不驚惶失措，爲着下學期開學時子女的學費發愁，甚至有的悉到寢食不安。開學，對這些家長們，好像是一重難關，開學的日期愈迫近，他們的愁眉愈展不開；至於大多數的學生，則不僅因爲家長憂愁而也深感不安，並且更要爲着自己仃將失學而起恐慌。所以站在學生和家長的立塲上，自然要主张收费標準定得愈低愈佳，甚至也要反對學校收取一學米」的辦法。但是轉過頭來，看看一般敎職員生活的因苦，那又必感覺這種主張未必完全公允了。</p>
<p>教師是作育下一代人才的褓姆，不僅對於民族國家有無上的貢獻，而且對於當前社會也有師表的作用。依理講，一般人沒有不尊重敎師的地位，而在敎師本人，自然也視爲神聖的事業。但是我國敎師生活的淸苦，自昔已然，於今爲烈。國家雖早有改善敎師待遇的計劃，只是事與願違，敎師的待遇不僅未見改善，反而每况愈下，時至今日，敎師每月的收入，有的甚至不能維特他一個人的生活，根本談不到仰事俯畜。這樣的生活，怎能希望敎師安心敎育下一代的國民！上學期已經過去了，下學期敎師的待遇必須改善，這是天公地這，誰也不能反對。一般私校平時經費的來源，校董會大都不負什麽責任，幾乎完全在於學生的學費，所以站在敎師的立塲，又不得不同情學校提高學費標準的要求。</p>
<p>顧全了家長的負擔，就顧不到教師的生活，反過來看，恰巧相反。這個矛盾的現象，假如在國家承平時代，本是不難解決的；只要國家多辦幾所學校，尤其是中小學校，再多補助一些私校，就可以兼顧到家長負祖和敎師生活了。但在今日，偏偏正值國家多難的時候，無師中央與地方，財政經濟困難萬狀，除了基本敎育而外，要政府負起敎育下一代靑年的整個責任，勢有所不可能。因此，學校收費問題，乃成爲當前的一大難題，家長·學生·校長·敎師，以及國家社會，無一不爲了這個問題而困擾，而焦慮。但是這個問題究竟應該怎樣解決玉算合理呢？我們認爲只要國家·社會·家長·學校·四方面都能够通力合作，都能够認識非常時期應有變通辦法，就不難獲得合理解決的辦法。我們姑先提出些辦法來，以供熱心敎育人士的參考。</p>
<p>第一，每一個學校的經濟，不論公立私立，應該絕對公開，量入爲出，敎師薪給與行政費用，應作一固定的比例，最好是八與二或七與三之比。在這個辦法之下，學生可出最低的學費，而教師可得最高的待遇。過去若干學校，因爲經濟的不公開，敎師的待遇未必能與學費依照比例增加；換句話說，增加了家長的負担，並未能提高敎師的待遇，所有學費收入，或且徒飽少數校長的私囊。此種人實爲上海敎育界的敗類，亦爲上海文化界的恥辱。所以我們希蘊激育當局能加緊對私校經濟的監督，務使其公開，學費收入除了行政費用而外，其餘均應騰敎師共有共享；無論如何，今後決不可再放任校長剝削敎師。同時，希望敎師拿了膩憑實據，站出來檢舉經濟不公開的校憂，務使學費收入的正當比例，均能充作敎師們的薪給。</p>
<p>第二，敎育當局在儘可能範圍內，按照憲法規定，力爭文化敎育經費在預算中所應得的百分比，而在應有的經費限度內，以涓滴歸公的精神，多多添設公立學校，儘量招收淸寒子弟，而對於成績卓著的私校，也應多予補助，充作增添設備之用，千萬不能專事放任其提高學費爲惟一維持學校的法門，使無數優秀的清寒學生望而卻步。</p>
<p>第三，社會上也應２普遍發起助學運動，搶救失學靑年，在各學校普設奬學金及助學金之類。例如本報發起的「讀者助學運動」，爲時宋久，所得助學金，爲數似已可觀；足見肚會上認識「助學最樂」的人士，也頗不少。我們希望社會各界，都能本着「幼吾幼以及人之幼」的精神，發動助學遝動，不問學費如何昂貴，也多少可使優秀靑年不致因學費無着而失學。</p>
<p>第四，我們以爲中國這個窮國家，又處在這非常窮迫的時期，爲救濟敎育危機計，不能不趕快酌量變通敎育制度，而尤其應該採取各級學校入學考試，全憑考生的學問本領，不以學校畢業體書爲標準。同時，我們更應鼓勵設立各種補習學校，公立圖書館·實驗室·運動塲，各種廣播學校，儘量推廣電化敎育，以爲付不起學費而又眞能好學不倦的人，別開一種自修求學的方便大道。唯有這樣，我們才能看見許多優秀的淸寒子弟，能够在家庭裏，在收音機旁，在圖書館裏，在實驗室中，在運動場上，求他們的智識，鍊他們的身體，一樣可以有和在正規學校裏上課肄業的八同等的學力，各級學校招考新生，旣以學力爲準，自能拔取眞才，決無妨於敎育的進步。救濟大量失學的靑年，也恐怕祗有推行這類辦法吧！</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十二日電〕外間紛傳莫斯科之談話難期獲有成果，但此間政治與外交各界對於此種悲觀消息均未予以證實，且謂談話現仍在進行中，自無理由鬆弛獲致良果之希望。當局對於莫斯科發展之情形，仍嚴守秘密而拒絕置許。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十二日電〕美軍政府發言人今日在廣播演說中稱，「目前莫斯科會談之保守秘密，並非此後强國間將恢復秘密外交之謂。在莫斯科會談之美大使史密斯有一億四千萬美人爲其後盾。渠舉出美國內民意測驗之結果稱，美國人民百分之八十，認爲西方國應留駐柏林，」即使發生戰爭亦在所不惜。</p>
<p>渠又追溯一九三八年與三九年羅斯福總統致希特勒之信函，曾被希特勒認爲柔弱之表示」，然「美國每年所生產之數萬輛坦克·數萬架飛機·以及原子彈，曾設明希特勒估計之錯誤。」九三八年來歷史之經驗，已使美國人睜開了眼睛。」渠末稱，「美國現在趕造可供七十隊空軍應用之飛機，然每一美國人希望是等現代化飛機終於不必加以應用。」</p>

<h3>高夫人自喻小鳥　願衝出鳥籠</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐釣十三日電〕因逃避「奴役和死亡」而在蘇聯領事館四樓跳樓的蘇聯女敎師高遜基娜夫人，十三日要求警察拒絕蘇聯官員進入她的警院病房，她設：「我怕他們，我不願看到任何來自蘇聯領事館的人員，高夫人對偵察副隊長摩林斯稱：「我怕看到他們，我怕他們所以我不顧看到他們。但蘇聯副總領事吉波尼克在三次被警察擋駕後仍稱：他將繼續嘗試，直到被許與她會談時爲止。高夫人現靜居於羅斯福醫院，在大批警察保護之下，以防止任何可能危害其生命的企圖，她的病情，據稱係「危險而不至致死」。帮助高夫人逃往托爾斯泰基金會的白俄遜齊諾夫，曾赴院探病，據他說高夫人曾對他稱：「我像一隻籠中的小鳥，我必須飛出去，我要努力衝出籠子」。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日合衆電〕爲避免回國脫離蘇方之蘇籍敎師桑馬林，頃秘密在衆院調查違反美國利益行動委員會中發言九十分鐘後，始離會塲。國會當局已允諾予以充分保陣，以防蘇方人士不能報復。衆議員麥德謂：美方已檢查桑馬林之身體，以駁斥蘇駐美大使潘友新所稱，桑馬林戰時頭部受傷，至今未愈，故對其言論，不負實任一節。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門總統今日痛罵第八十屆國會，爲不作一事的國會。同時，對共和黨所稱物價正在調整一點，答覆稱，「物價確乎正在調整每星期調整得高一點」。杜氏吿記者稱，共和黨之抑制通貨膨脹法案，決不能停止物價之上漲，但同意參議員塔虎脫之預測，認爲物價漲風不久即可停止。杜氏可能於明日簽署該法，但將再斥責國會不採納其工資管制及配售之建議。杜氏控訴「各委員會主席於特別會議中，且曾多次拒絕考慮其建議。渠稱，本年度榖物豐收，可使消費者减輕負担，但需時尚長。</p>
<h3>美建議擴大多瑙委員會　蘇聯集團表反對　維辛斯基猛烈抨擊馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社貝爾格勒十二日電〕西方國家十二日企圖推翻蘇聯限制新多瑙河委員會委員國爲蘇聯及其六個流域國家的計劃，但顯然不過爲另一種無效的姿態而已，美國建議擴大委員會，包括美，英，法及奧地利在內，德國在和約簽訂後亦得參加。美代表圑副主席並表示，如奧德均成爲委員國，對於不參加委員會國家的代表權並有適當規定，美國願意放棄委員國的資格。南羅代表則譴責英美，企圖以經濟勢力侵入多瑙河區域。</p>

<p>〔合衆社雅典十二日電〕希臘政府軍十二日深入葛羅麻斯山區，直至阿爾巴尼亞邊界。美陸軍觀察員預料，此舉將使叛黨在北希建立獨立國家之企岡，完全粉碎。政府公報已宣佈此項進展，親赴前綫督戰的索福里斯總理，預測在二星期中，將能獲得勝利。陸軍部則稱，據被俘之游學隊士兵談稱馬柯斯的叛軍士氣，已極消沉。</p>
<h3>美承認韓新政府南明全文</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕美國暫行承認韓國新政府之聲明全文如下：「在一九四三年十二月一日在開羅發表之聯合宣言中，該宣言之簽字國即美國，中國與英國曾表示其決心，「即在適當時期刺鮮應成爲自由獨立」，此項決心，在一九四五年七月廿六日之波茨坦宣言中予以重申，而於蘇聯於同年八月八日向日本宣戰之後，該國亦參與此項宣言。一九四五年十二月廿七日，蘇·美·英外長在莫斯科簽訂一項協定，規定重建朝鮮爲一獨立國家，此項協定，其後中國政府亦參加在內，決予恪守。雖日本之兼併朝鮮已因該國於一九四五年八月及九月爲蘇聯與美國之武裝鄧隊所佔領而吿完全終止，但四國所鄭重保證之朝鮮之自由與獨立，在實現上證明甚爲緩遲。美國政府於艱苦努力幾近兩年，以謀與其他佔領國經談判而實施此等保證終吿無效之後，當即於一九四七年九月十七日將朝鮮獨立問題置諸於聯合國大會之前。聯大極大多數國家之意志，表現於一九四七年十一月十四日所通過之兩項決議中，此兩決議之目的，乃在使朝鮮人民企求已久之自由與獨立，終能經由舉行自由選舉從而建立全國性政府之辦法，而成爲可能。爲寶施此等決議起見，朝鮮臨時委會加以督察，以謀滬舉國民議會之代表，其後再經由議會成立一國民政府。當時選出之國民議會於五月卅一日召開，且已着手組織政府。此外並希望北韓人民雖因蘇聯拒絕准許在其佔領區內實施聯大決議而宋能參與五月十日之選舉，但在適當過程中終能在此一政府中担任其應有之地位。新政府成立之通知，係於一九四八年八月六日送迷聯合國朝鮮臨時委織會者。「美政府之意見，認爲如此產生之朝鮮新政府，理應視作一九四七年十一月十四日大會決議案所預期之朝鮮政府。在等待大會在未來第三屆會議中考盧聯合國朝鮮問題臨時委員會之報吿以前，美國依照其身爲佔領國之責任，將委派特別代表一人，前往漢城，與瑚鮮政府及聯合國臨時委員會，共同談判關於一九四七年十一月十四日第二屆決議案第四節所規定各項條款之履行問題，總統已任命羅特島之馬卡諾充任上述之特別代表，該代表將有大使之銜」。</p>
<h3>緬叛亂擴大　情勢益嚴重</h3>

<h3>美日新匯兌率　週內可公布</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京十三日電〕據十三日華盛頓訊，預料日元之匯兌率，將在一週內公佈。但此間官員稱，彼等預料在短期內不致有任何行動。華盛頓消息處通方面稱：日元之匯兌率，大致將爲二七〇日元合一美元。此與目前之軍事匯兌率相仝。然該方又預料，各種貿易可能各設若干種匯兌率，東京方面承認，此一問題尚在考慮中。</p>
<h3>史達林的繼承人　這還是一個最大的秘密</h3>
<p>— 作者密特爾敦</p>
<p>苛里城的修鞋匠的兒子釣瑟·史達林，今年六十八歲，這一點是蘇聯最重要的政治事實。每年黑海岸蘇契的假期，總有一段悠長的時問，也總是一再謠傳這位領袖患癌症，這個繼承問題也一月較一月來得嚴重。世界上最有權咸的統治者，是這個極權國家的首腦，他引爲自豪的總體政制，是從上而下的。繼承的問題或會使統一破裂。</p>
<p>莫斯科方面認爲史達林已準備好繼承人了。這一點在這秘密的國度中，是秘密中的秘密。因爲假如一旦繼承人的名字公開了，在政府中便可能演成分裂的情勢。或則史達林和繼承人間分裂，削弱前者的權力，或則史達林和其繼承人與其他有權獲得此一地位者間的衝突。</p>
<p>蘇聯國家最高權力的試驗，要看目前史迷林手下有繼承資格的無情，能幹，智慧的人物，在史達林死後能不能服從他的選擇而決定。歷史的前例表現，指定繼承人往往是激起爭權最有力的一種手段。</p>
<p>四位繼承人</p>
<p>有四個人是最適當的繼承者。最知名的是莫洛托夫他自一九三九年便任外交部長至現在，今年五十七歲，曾任人民委員會主席十一年。在未來爭取領導繼的鬥爭中，莫洛托夫是代表政府的人物。他是政府和官僚政治的經理，他在政治局中較任何其他人物卓越，他懂得如何運用官僚和政府機構這部錯綜的機器。在一個政府和工業方面缺乏技衛人材的國度中，這一點是很重要。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫還另有兩個條件。他較任何其他政府最上層人物經騐豐富，一九一七年革命時已和列寗和史達林合作，這一點在歷史上有極大的重要性。</p>
<p>日丹諾夫有如旭日初升的形勢。他措理共產國際的組織工作，負責發佈共產主義理諭和國外黨的活動路綫的訓令，今年五十一歲，任黨中央委員會書記和政治局委員。</p>
<p>日丹諾夫的力量反映黨的力量。戰爭期間軍隊削弱黨的地位，自從戰爭結束迄今，共產黨黨負釣增至五百萬人，重獲昔日的優勢。</p>
<p>貝利亞是史達林周圍較不知名的人物。他和史達林同是喬治亞人，今年四十八歲。他的可能取得繼承人地位，是由於他的學識和對保安機構，最近被提名爲國家保安部次。早在一九四六年，貝利亞已離開這位置從事「特務工作」了。這一切都未經證實，但是，衆信貝利亞負有組織軍事和工業研究原子分裂的重大任務。</p>
<p>貝利亞是部長委員會的副主席，一般說，這一位置給與他管理二三個重要部會的權力。但是，照他目前的地位，他的領得這個銜頭，便可能有權控制一切和他的工作有聯緊的部會。</p>
<p>布爾加寧元帥自戰爭結束以來，已成爲最有希望的繼承人，他的担任陸軍部長，表示黨的力量已勝過戰爭時佔得優勢的軍事人物的地位。政治局輪值委員的布爾加寗元帥是軍人在該局的代表人，他的軍部沒有正規部隊，他並非黨方面爲排斥異已而崛起的軍事領袖。戰時，他握有重工業合作的重要位置，戰前是國家銀行的行長。</p>
<p>此四人以外另有二人，他們即使沒有繼承的責格，至少都和領袖有友誼和聯繫。</p>
<p>其一是馬倫柯夫他是政治局的委員，協助日丹諾夫組織共產黨。另一是卡岡諾維，他負有戰後重大的工作，最近從事烏克蘭的淸黨工作。一九四七年十二月十九日重任昔年的工作，爲部長委會的副主席，他和馬倫柯夫同是政治局的委員。（上）</p>
<h3>耶城停止攻擊新建議　以色列正式拒絕　貝那多特稱阿盟已表示接受</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十三日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦調人貝那多特伯爵返瑞典途中，十三日道出此間，發表談話稱：渠曾建議聯合國派軍四十人駐守拉特倫，保護水站，然未蒙採納，今者耶路撒冷無水可飲矣。貝氏相信炸毁水站者，係阿拉伯非正規軍。貝那多特伯爵十三日稱：以色列政府已拒絕自十三日格林威治時間下午二時起由阿猶雙方停止還擊之建議。貝氏稱：以政府之決定「使猶人負責頗重」。渠稱：阿方原已接受其建議。</p>

<h3>豪富恐慌　紛紛自動沒求見市長　後天可能有一人姓名公布　迄今收到現欵僅一萬餘億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市新聞記者羣，昨日下午五時，集體趨訪吳市長於其辦公室，叩詢救濟特捐之進展情形。因特捐迄今尚停留於「只聞樓織響」階段，勸募委員會屢次表示對懼吝齋富將公佈名單，惟絕無具體「攤牌」表示。記者等昨特堅請吳市長略予透露一二。據市長稱：下週一（十六日）可能有某一豪富之名將予公佈。記者詢以該毫富係屬何業鉅子？渠暫不願公佈，僅稱：本市之豪富階級現已相當恐慌，日來自動求見市長者爲數頗多。渠並表示某豪富姓名公佈後，必可收「殺一儆百」之效，深信今後勸募工作之展開，將較便利矣。</p>
<p>昨有記者詢以是否本市所有豪富盡入市府勸募網中？渠答：凡與政治有關之豪富，不在地方範圍以內，規定由中央負責勸募之。又吳市長宣稱：救濟特捐勸募委員會發佈經勸募總額四萬餘億，係包括美金公債及花園洋房等不動產在內。實際上委員會收得之現款僅一萬億元，其中九千億元已存入上海市銀行購買國庫券，餘數分存其他銀行中，本利皆供地方籌組警備旅之用。至於房屋及公債等，則將定期公開拍資之。</p>

<h3>一批尼龍襪　封存起問題　約谷伯廠稱係國產　社局處理深感困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕尼龍絲襪自禁售以後，社會局前日會同警察局前往林森中路大華百貨公司抄獲男用尼龍絲襪十五打零四雙，女用尼龍絲襪十三雙，昨日社局忽接江蘇路曹家宅三號約谷伯機廠呈稱：此項絲襪係該廠出品，該廠曾經前經濟部准許，發給工字第一二一六〇號工廠登記證，海關並准許該項尼能絲襪外銷，吸收若干外匯，該項尼龍絲襪原料雖來自美國，但織造純係國產，該廠現有工人二百餘人，如禁售以後，勢交工廠停業，工人解僱，影響甚大云云。社局接獲此項星文後，深感處理困難，因該襪確係國產，已經前經濟部登記有案，但如發還，則又恐妨礙禁令，故對於處置辦法，尚在考盧中</p>

<h3>搭車誤會起衝突　電車停頓二小時　外灘一場惡戰結果道歉了事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨午南京路外灘，軍人與電車司機售票員又發生衝突，英商一路·二路·七路·八路·十路·十一路等各綫電車，自中午十二時零五分起停駛，至下午二時十八分始吿恢復，前後停頓二小時十三分。茲誌經過如後：</p>
<p>昨午十二時正，英商一路第四十二號有軌電車抵迷北京路外灘後，機件忽吿損壞，無法開動，適有八路電車一輛駛到，將該車頂送至南京路外灘，用鐵索繫於二路電車之後，擬拖回赫德路廠修理。正欲開車時，忽來穿軍服者十餘人，堅欲搭乘此已損壞之電車，車上司機售票等吿以此車進廠修理，不再搭客，請其改乘他車，不料因此引起誤會，竟至相互毆鬥。據目擊者談：當時已有三五軍人上車，與司機·售票在車中大聲爭吵，其中有一士兵忽扭住一體胖司機之胸口衣服，將其猛力一推，撞及頭等車箱入口處車門，砰然一聲，玻璃粉碎，司機即扭住該人不放，其他軍人見已肇事，即擬脫身，乃上前將此司機推開，一同下車向仁記路而去。售票司機大聲呼援，此時電車人員越聚越多，聲勢壯盛，羣起奮呼，蜂擁沿仁記路追趕，一售票員並取出身邊警笛狂嗚助威，移時在數十電車工人簇擁下，扭回軍人一名，並將其關入車中，有人呌打，有人喝止，正紛擾間，其餘軍人忽又衝回，救出被關軍人，因此又引起一塲混戰。其時並有過路軍人多名，亦加人助戰，沙遜大廈門前，一時交通斷絕，「混戰」約五分鐘，即自動停止，除第六七二號售票員左眼角受傷流血外，餘無受傷。其時，警局已得訊驅警備車，「上海護土」等車到塲，將電車工人及肇事軍人一併帶回黃浦警局，經訊問之下，悉該批穿軍服者係某校學員，具有軍人身份，乃轉解蓬萊路憲兵團部，該批學兵自知理缺，乃向電車工人致歉，工人方面亦以僅一人輕傷，不願多事，一塲糾紛乃吿解決。</p>

<h3>謀財勒死舞女　無錫慘案破獲　要犯祝晶慶在沁就逮　解錫途中跳車受重傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕無錫萬前路有惠里四號好友嚮導社舞女李美玉（廿四歲），七日與稔客祝晶慶，張仁忠兩人至郊外遊，當日美玉未返。翌日淸晨，有刈柴童孩攀登惠山二茅峯巓（即靑山灣），發現服裝華魔之女屍一具，頸有袴帶一條，緊結頸間，面上有小刀傷一處。後由惠山鎭地保投報當地縣警察局，派警前往調查，並報請地檢處相騐。風聲四佈，該好友嚮導社亦得悉，正以美玉未返而生疑，即由其丈夫往認，則確爲該女。事後經縣警局四出偵查，認定祝晶慶，張仁忠兩人有重大嫌疑，據其夫言，美玉手上曾戴有金鐲一副，脚上亦籠金鐲一只，又戴金項鏈，金鎖片，金戒，總共重逾三兩，均已被劫，故斷定係謀財害命。經數日偵杳之結果，獲悉祝晶慶爲無錫人，廿三歲，當過游擊隊，本係一無賴。去年曾在滬東懷德路大安橡膠廠做工人。張仁忠爲江灣人，與祝同在該廠做工。祝寓上海齊齊哈爾路匯山里對面木房內，並悉該犯已潛回上海。十一日夜，由無錫縣警局備就公文，派刑本警察隊員黃鵬，朱信兩人，搭車來滬，與本市警務機關接洽後，派警協助，於十二日淸晨六時半，馳往齊齊哈爾路木房內，果將祝犯擒獲，寄押榆林路分局。據祝供，五日由上海至無錫，住大陸飯店十八號，後移永安飯店二十七號，八日午後四時回上海，對美玉被害一案，矢口否認，該犯已於當日下午四時半，由無錫縣警局來員迎提返錫歸案究辦，至張仁忠一名，至今尚在續緝中。</p>

<h3>電信與交通</h3>
<p>— 刁治炳</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>生活在現時代的人民，隨着時代的車輪前進，人與人之間的關係日益複雜和密切，通訊聯絡的需要也日益增加，因此郵電便成爲今日的新興公用事業。但由於歷史遺留下來的積習，政府與人民之間，不僅沒有感情，而且還缺乏合作的精神，以致影響工作的推進，未能收到預期的效果，姑拋開大的政治設施不談，試專以電信部門而言，如果你希望你的電報能够很妥速的傳到對方的手裏，或希望你打電話時一叫就通，那麼上海電信局最近發起的電報準確和電話節時運動是很有效的辦法。但雖經電信局一再宣傳，能了解和實行的人還是太少，這不能不說是電話發展前途上的一件缺憾。</p>
<p>數月前電信與郵票的展覽，先後出現在上海人的眼中，引起了廣泛的注意和興趣，記者在這裏先來談電信與交通的關係，郵政事業容後另爲文述之。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>像我們這樣的國家，要想從落後的，進步而爲現代化，當須從事於外方面的發展，交通建設問題，應該是一切發展中首要的一端。所謂交通，包括精神與物一質，即通信與運輸兩大項目。交通之於國家，一如神經，血管之於人體。鐵路，公路，航空以及航海是血管，電信與郵政是神經。我們沒有看見一個神經系統和血管組職不健全的人而能健康，正如我們在世界上找不到一個交通事業不發達的闕家而能富强一樣。建鐵路，築公路，發展航空，開闢航海等等，固然是積極的交通建設，但終不足以使整個交通臻於靈活和健全。何况此項運轍交通若無通信的配合發展，則其自身將無法迅速完成，和失其交通的效用。</p>
<p>譬如說，一條鐵路或公路的建築，事先必須敷設電信，以做測量路綫，修架橋樑，築土方，鋪枕木及掛鐵軌等各種龐大浩繁工程的聯繫。即在完成以後，如行車安全，車輛調度，以及一切臨時緊急的措置，則又無一不須電信以傅達消息。至於飛機輪船在空中與海上之行駛，幾全賴電信爲之報告氣象，指導方位，降陸或傍岸等，否則其能照常活動自如者幾希。明乎此，可知電信設備越優良，越完備，則各種運輸交通越安全，越迅速，故電信不僅自身爲一重要交通工具，而且是交通的交通。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>所以，近代通信，郵電便成爲生要的工具，而電信傳遞尤較迅捷，無論文字，語言均可籍電能自天涯瞬息以傳至海角。打破時間與空間的限制，縮小了世界的範圍，令人有「天涯若比鄰」之感。</p>
<p>在美國，去年General　Motors公司曾試辦在橫越中西部向芝加哥行駛之Train　of　Tomorrow號火車上，與在大西洋上開往倫敦之伊麗莎伯皇后號輪船通無綫電話。話音自車上發出，至Calumet　city，經陸綫傳至芝加哥之WGN電台，再轉紐約至一千八百哩以外行駛於大西洋之皇后輪。車內旅客與船上旅客通話三十七分鐘，聲音淸晰，獲得異常成功。近來美國各火車上多有無綫電話設備，予旅客在交通上極大的便利。</p>
<p>電信拔術，日新月異。美國近已發明一種超速傳眞電報機。該機係採用一種高速度電傳圖畫方法，以無惰性之陰極光綫，配合移動極快之照相膠片，每分鐘可傳一百萬字，還有英國倫敦「標準電話電纜公司」出品的「SOJ十二路載彼電話，可以在一對綫上，容訏三十二人同時講話，或三百八十六人同時發報，而互不干擾。這些成就，不僅節省物力，抑且增加速率，减少時間的浪費，其對於交通及一切事業貢獻之大，不言可知也。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>據上年統計，全世界的電話共約五千一百萬號。美國佔二千七百萬號，平均每五人一具電話。英國三百九十萬號，每十二人一具。法國一百八十萬號，每二十人一具。中國十六萬號，每三千人一具。美國的電話綫爲一億七千八百萬公里，電報綫三百六十萬公里，中國的電報電話綫各約十萬公里。美國每人每年打電報二次，中國一年中，平均三十三人僅打電報一次。</p>
<p>從上面的數字，我們可以看出一偶國家的富强，必有賴於交通之發達，而交通之發達又須籍電信爲之作開路先鋒。中國的電信交通，過去遭受軍閥的割據和抗戰的摧殘，先天旣已不足，後天又失調養，加以今日之政治不能安定，經濟無可繁榮，器材仰給外國，內戰頻加破壞，除了京。滬。漢。穗幾個大都市稍有建樹而外，其他接近戰區的都是創夷滿目，破碎支離。恢復尙且不易，發展何從談起。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>中國今後不欲列於强國之林則已，否則，我們應該提高警覺，正視現實，正視交通。强調電信與交通的重要，從而建設和發展電信事業，建立起嚴密的全國通信網，堅强的負起時代所賦予電信的重大任務和使命。</p>
<h3>代傳長途電話</h3>
<p>— 朱容</p>
<p>一般民衆對於使用長途電話，顯然已成習慣，但對於「代傳長途電話」這個較新的業務，似乎還陌生，在某種塲合下，懂得代傳方法的，就佔了便宜，這裏就想簡單的把它介紹一下；</p>
<p>撥一個長途電話，對方受話人的住址往往離通話地方很遠，需要電信局派差直接通知，（就是呌人通話）通知後奔到聽話的地方，時間上非常浪費而有時候發話人事務繁忙，不能等待對方的回音，同時又沒有代替發話的人，於是可以利用這項代傳電話，把自己要講的話委託電信局負責代傳，雖不能直接互談，但其效果，有時會比自己直接交談還淸晰明白。</p>
<p>而且，傅發代傅電話的手續，非常簡便，發話人用電話向長途台掛號時，先聲明要「代傳電話」以便於區別，再報「發話人姓名」，「發話電話號碼」，「受話地址」，「受話電話號碼」，「受話人姓名」，以及扼要的「代傳內容」。長途台的記錄員就立刻記下來，再複述一遍，這樣，可以避免錯誤。如果發話人直接向電信局的營業處去掛號，那更方便，除了塡寫自己和對方的姓名住址電話號碼外，還可把代傳的內容，用淺近的文字，顯明的語句，塡上掛號單，文字不要過於冗長，最好不要超過三十字。</p>
<p>這辦法祗限「加急呌人通話一適用，通話費照加急呌人通話一次價目收費。電信局可以負責在二小時內代傳至對方，至於銷號和退號，和加急呌人同樣辦理。</p>
<h3>為什麼電話打不通</h3>
<p>— 吉爾</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>筆者最近到一位老同學所辦的一個工廠去參觀，那廠內裝有一旦電信局所轄的電話（即俗稱（O2）電話），因爲筆者服務於電信局，他就問我：「爲什麼這電話常常打不通」？我問了他打什麼號碼，便拿起聽話筒代他打，却很順利地打通了。</p>
<p>咦！難道打電話還有什麼「內行」與「外行」之分麼？這話眞很難說了。</p>
<p>我再問那位同學，所謂常常打不通，是想打那些號碼，聽他一說，原來都是上海電話公司區域內的電話。又問他平常如何打法，（即如何撥所要的號碼），才恍然於他的所以電話常常打不通，大部份是因不諳電信局與電話公司間電話的聯絡，應該用如何的撥號法而起的。</p>
<p>眞的，因爲全上海的電話分屬於二大區域，因此除了不免間有發生的內外機綫的障碍外，大部份的電話之所以打不通，恐與我那位同學一樣，係因不諳準確的撥號法而起。因此，對於兩者間的連絡，以及如何撥號，似有重加說明的必要。（本文所欲討論之「為什麼電話打不通」？係專注意如何由電信局用戶打至電話公司之用戶，以下將專就此項論列）。原來自電信局用戶打至電話公司用戶之法，係聽到一表軌聲」後，必須先撥一「〇」字，又必須等聽到第二個「表軌聲」（由電話公司發出，與電話公司用戶直接聽到之「表軌聲」相同），然後才可再照所要之電話號碼撥打。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>自電信局通至電話公司爲上述聯絡作用而設的綫路，在虹口局有125對，在南市局有95對，稱爲「中繼綫」；即虹口局同時祗能有125個用戶打至電話公司之用戶，而南市局則同時祇能有95個用戶打至電話公司之用戶。所以倘你佔用了一對綫，就是別的用戶少了一個機會。但通常亦沒有十分困難，因爲你佔用一對綫而用以打通講話的時間大多不過二·三分鐘，即使因喚人而稍等，亦不過四·五分鐘，打過亦就掛斷，別人即可加以利用，所以上述中繼綫的對數，以目下的用戶數量看來，亦儘足應付的了。然而倘你佔用了一對綫而沒有能好好利用，遂沒有打通；因打不通而仍佔用那對綫不放，結果還是打不通，而別人的機會却報你佔去了。</p>
<p>現在應該來談談我那位同學究竟爲什麼常常打不通。原來他雖然知道聽到第一個「表軌聲」後先撥一「〇」字，但却不管第二個「表軌聲」來了沒有，就去撥所要的電話公司用戶號碼。倘等他撥完後而第二個「表軌聲」才來，那倒也罷了，他或者會聽到後重撥過的；最糟糕的是當他撥到中間（或已撥一個字，或兩個字，或三個字，或四個字），那第二個「表軌聲」倒來了，他却自管自撥，於是等於他只撥四個字，或三個字，或二個字，或一個字。這是一種號碼沒有撥全的毛病，於是機件被他佔用，電話沒有打通，而他却還在老等哩！（舉個例，譬如他要打一二三四五，撥「〇」後接連撥，在撥一一」字後，第二個「表軌聲」來了，結果等於撥的是二三四五。倘再隨便撥一個字，臀如說六吧，那就打到二三四五六號的用戶那裏去了。而倘不再撥，那就停住了。）</p>
<p>還有很多人根本不先撥「〇」，直接就撥所要的號碼，因此不是撥錯，便是聽到類似於「佔綫聲」的「空號聲」。</p>
<p>還有人同我那位同學一樣，撥「〇」後接連再撥，撥完後，那第二個「表軌聲」才來，但他却又以爲那是第一個「表軌聲」，重行再撥「〇」，那又打不通了。</p>
<p>還有八撥「〇」後，等第二個「表軌聲」不來，他就將聽話筒擱在一旁，而去做別的事；這是一種因爲有時話務繁忙，以致中繼綫不易獲得，或者中繼綫雖獲得而第二個「表軌聲」來得遲，因而想搶先佔用的壞法子，最是「要不得」。其實撥「〇」後倘不是聽到「佔綫聲」，則第二個「表軌聲」終是要來的，至多一二分鐘；而目這種第二個「表軌聲」來了後只維持半分鐘，在此半分鐘內倘不加以利用而撥號，那它就過去了，而機件却空被佔用。所以倘上述之人歇了一會再拿起聽話筒來聽聽，其實那第二個「表軌聲」或者早就已經過去了，他却以爲還沒有來，還是將聽話筒擱開，還在老等。這却糟了，一方面機件被佔用，別的用戶不能利用，以致話務愈顯得忙，於是用戶們愈想搶先佔用，而因此中繼綫及第二個「表軌聲」愈不容易獲得，而他却還抱怨電話之打不通哩！</p>
<p>還有人撥「〇」後，確因爲所有中繼綫一時繁忙，均不空閑，便聞到「佔綫聲」，這時雁當掛起，隔一會重打，而他却仍自管自撥號，於是亦沒有打通的希望。</p>
<p>開始的「表軌聲」，係一種一「嗡嗡嗡」連續不斷的聲音。在電信局所發出的，聲音較微弱而散；在電話公司所發出的，亦即撥「〇」後所聞到的所謂第二個「表軌聲」，其音較强而勁直。用戶們不妨在下午或晚上話務較閑的時候撥聽，細細比較一下，即可辨明，辨知後可將聽話筒即行掛斷，不算打一次電話的。</p>
<p>所謂「佔綫聲」，亦可稱「繁忙聲」，係一種「吱…吱…吱…」的聲音。乃表示話綫不空，或被呌用戶的電話在用。</p>
<p>「空號聲」係表示沒有這一號用戶。在電信局，此聲與「佔綫聲」相近似；在電話公司，則係一種「嗲嗲嗲嗲……嗲嗲嗲嗲嗲嗲……」的聲音。</p>
<p>又有一種「回鈴聲」，係表示已在振被呌用戶的鈴，那是一種「蔔轆轆轆……蔔轆轆轆」的聲音。</p>
<p>因此，欲求電話之能迅速接通，除了電信局與電話公司之對內外機綫經常多加注意外，獲得用戶之合作，大家能準確撥號，亦是重要的一着。</p>
<h3>電信常識講話（十）（三）</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第六講　怎樣計算字數（續）</p>
<p>這裏，請先從幾乎佔據電局全部電報中的百分之九十以上的華文明語電文談起，凡是打過電報的人，誰都曉得華文明語電文是用交通部所編的電碼新編譯戊以每四個數碼爲一組的電碼拍發，待等收報局收到之後，再從電碼新編裏譯成文字，然後投送給收報人，這種用電碼譯成文字的辦法，世界各國都無先例，原因爲中國文字的結搆過於複雜，纔採取這種不得已的辦法，這些前面都已談過，這裏不再多說。</p>
<p>每一個中文字旣然限用包括四個數目字的電碼組成，作爲中文字的代表的電碼組合，在計算字數的時候，自然也以每四個數碼——也就是代表一個中文字—作為一字。電文裏面如有必須確實作用表示數目的數目字組，也可以直接用阿拉伯數目字畫寫，但必須在這數目字組合的前後，加用一括弧符號，以免和代表中文字的電碼組合互相混纏，這些寫在括弧裏面的數目字組合，也以每四個數目字作爲一字，如有小數點等等符號，每一符號都作爲一個數目字，數目字組前後所加的括弧符號，在國內電報裏可以免費，但為使文義明顯，切合明語電報必須具備的條件起見，每一數目字組之後，必須加一適當的單位字，如「元」「件」等等。例如：</p>
<p>（例一）「壽星紗一千五百包」原爲八個字，如果寫做「壽星紗（1500）包」祗作五字計費。</p>
<p>（例二）「單價八十七元五角」原爲八個字，如果寫做「單價（87·50）元」祗作五個字計費（因爲括弧裏的數目字組連小數點在內已經超過四位，應作二字），這裏，請再考慮一下，如果我們把它寫做「單價（87·5元」意義同樣明顯，而在計算報費的時候，再可省去一字（因爲括弧裏的數目字連小數點在內，祗剩四位）。</p>
<p>近年法幣貶値，買賣進出的款額，大都在億位以上，所以上面所舉的例子，已經不很實用，例如於其把「廿五億」寫做（2，500，000，000）要作四個字計費（因爲連撇號在內共計十三個數目字須作四字），還不如寫做「廿五億」三個字來得直截了當。電局爲了不使國客吃虧，新近又補充了一種臨時辦法，那就是准許把「廿五億」寫做「（25）億」，這樣，就祇要作爲二個字計費，終究比完全寫出來得合算</p>
<p>關於撰擬華文電報電稿在字句方面的節省辦法，筆者雖則不想提供實例，但有一些個人的見解願意貢獻給諸位讀者參考，誰都懂得用寫文章或寫信的筆調來撰擬商電的電稿該是傻瓜們所幹的事，可是，根據筆者翻查電底所得的觀感，覺得除開體裁以外，我們還可以更進一步，把電稿裏面所用的「詞」，酌量情形，儘可能改用足以表示完全意義的單字，例如用「決」字來代表「決定」，用「收」字來代表「收到」，用「入」代表「收入」等等。我們所以說要「酌量情形」的理由是有些「詞」表面上看起來似乎沒有多大出入，但事實上却有不盡相同的涵義，例如「收到」和「收入」，前者有收到某種實物的意思，而後者或者祇指帳務的移轉，所以，在運用「以字代詞」的時候，還得仔細考慮，務求不違背原來意義爲先決條件。</p>
<p>講到這裏，筆渚連帶想起一件非常有趣的往事：當抗戰期間，往來電報須受撿查，當局爲防制擾亂市塲，對於大後方各地所發的商電裏所用飛漲狂漲等等前一形容字眼，一槪予以删扣，有一次一位檢查先生稍一疎忽，竟把原來準備加在「飛」字上面的槓子誤劃到「漲」字上面去，相信收報人看到這張電文之後，決不會把「價飛」看做「物價飛跌」吧？從這裏，我們舉一反三，不難獲得另一個新的見解，那就是有些用一個形容字和一個動詞字組成的詞句，在不妨礙原來意義的原則之下，也未始不能祇用一個形容字來代表它的完全意義。另一方面，有些精明乖巧的發報人，早在無形中制定了一些普遍通用的電文術語，例如在款額前而加上一個「電」字如「電百億元」就是表示一電匯一百億元」，但同樣「速電」兩個字，却有兩種不同的涵義，我們旣可把它解釋做「速即電覆」，也可解釋做「速即電匯，須得心領神會，纔能靈活運用。</p>
<p>華文密語電文，祗限國內電報適用，規定以四個或五個數目字搆成一組，每組作爲一字計費，電文裏如有不到四個數目字或超過五個數目字搆成的組合，就得把全電當作洋文綴字語電報計費。按國內華文密語電報和洋文綴字語電報的價目相同，這裏所說照洋文綴字語電報計費，也就等於說，所有電文裏用以搆成數目字組合的數目字，如在五個數目字以內者作爲一字，超過五個數目字而不滿十個數目字者作爲二字，以上并照此類推。</p>
<p>華文密語電報裏如有確實用以表示數目的數目字組合，也可以直接用阿拉伯數目字畫寫，并在組合前後加置括弧符號，這種數目字組合，不管電文裏的密碼是用四個或五個數目字所撲成，都以每組在五個數目字以內者作爲一字計費，組內如有小數點等等符號，每一符號視作一個數目字，前後加置的括弧和華文明語電報同樣可以免費，但被當作洋文綴字語處理的電報，每一副括弧（包括前括弧和後括弧），應另行作爲一個字計費。</p>
<p>凡用華文密語成的國際電報，全電須照綴字語電報處理，留待下面再談。</p>
<h3>電信車</h3>
<p>— 本刊資料室</p>
<p>去年年底，在美國巴的摩爾地方舉行的「一百五十年來進步科學博覽會」上，西聯公司陳列着一件電信界的新奇玩意兒，是一個裝在車子上的電報局——「電信車」。這種車子曾在巴的摩爾的郊外試行，獲得了令人滿意的收獲。</p>
<p>追溯歷史，一八四四年的五月二十四日，由華盛頓發出來的第一張電報，是被巴的摩爾收到的。而現在這個地方接受這份發明的試驗，在歷史上說起來應該是非常適宜的。</p>
<p>當「電信車」在指定的住宅區行駛的時候，那發自西聯公司巴的摩爾局「傳眞」發報機的電報，都可以通過超短波的無綫電裝置而被其收到，在車輛的機器板下面裝着一個「傳眞」記錄器，而這些電報都自動地被這部記錄器收下來，每一張收下來的電報與原來發的完全一樣，報差立刻可以開車到電報上所開的地址，完成一次非常迅速的投遞。</p>
<p>所有的電報或覆電由「電信車」上的報差收集，並且很快的用無綫電發到西聯公司，再由西聯公司轉發到各收報地點，西聯公司駐巴的威爾總管樓良先生說：「在實驗時期「電信車」每次被指定在城北十二平方英里的區域內行駛，當它行駛到該區域時，任何發到該區的電報，立刻從巴的摩爾總局發到「電信車」上」。</p>
<p>回顧教國現有的行動電局，雖沒有「傳眞」的設備，但關於傳遞迅速一方面也有超短波無綫電聯絡，今後慢慢的改進，未嘗不可成爲一輛「電信車」呢？</p>

<h3>銀根鬆濫行局雖有差進　物價昨又全面上升　食米市勢暴漲特粳出六千萬關</h3>
<p>昨日物價又告普遍上張，跟根鬆弛，乃其最大原因，米市因無錫價昂，市價上升，上白粳高達六千一百萬元，麵粉則以北帮採購頓旺，漲勢亦勁。紗布細紗，在識造廠購辦之下，價格俏利。絲綢出口較活，上漲頗多，西藥以成本提高，各貨報漲，烟皂雖實銷不多，惟受其他物價影響，升昂頗勁。金融市塲市氣興奮，華股向高峯盤旋，銀樓飾金議價續升，進價五億二千萬元，賣出五億六千萬元，仍屬求過於供。結匯證一度升至七百四十萬元，午刻稍回。</p>
<p>昨日本市銀根鬆濫異常，商品市塲，全面上升。四行二局一庫，於銀錢業票據交換中，有一一五二五億之差進，就中以中央銀行獨家差進三九六三二億，爲數最鉅，中國銀行差進二〇一九億，交通銀行差出二六八七一億，農民銀行差出四三一九億，中信局差進一二三六億，郵匯局差出二八八七億，中央合作金庫差進二七一五億，商業行莊大交換差出八三二億，小交換差出一九四七〇億，外商銀行共計差進八七七七億</p>
<h3>米市騰漲　油糧猛升</h3>
<p>米市　猛烈騰升，特高粳跨越六千萬大關，創六千一百萬新價，亦漲一成。綠產地價漲，到貨减少，其他物價無不登峯造極，執主心思極堅，早市即挺二三百萬，繼因米店補吸甚急，市况俏俐不懈，遂於後市再加二三百萬，合升五六百萬元。薄稻達五千九百萬，西塘新洋秈五千萬開出，糙米貨主執住少售，故少交易。昨日二市到貨爲三五五八石。</p>
<p>麺粉　飛黃騰達，日創新高價，昨日各牌粉均已闖出二千萬大關，漲一成半左右，因小麥價高，廠方加盤，人心極堅。老車開市二〇九〇萬，收市疾登二二三〇萬高價，漲二百八十萬元。兵船及紅蜂建成各爲二一五〇萬元，雜牌粉俏升二百餘萬，大包麩皮挺二百萬，小麥二九〇〇萬。</p>
<p>雜糧　登峰造極，一致疾升，因米價之勁漲，人心爲之激動。黃豆客帮取之甚殷，九江冬豆油帮去化開四千萬，計漲四百萬元。苞米靑島續添，升三百萬，無麥汕帮復加入納取，北帮追進更急，猛加五百萬。蠶豆砌高二百萬，茶豆市沉悶，略昂而已。豌豆亦挺一二百萬，芝蔴加升六七百萬，白蔴登九千萬高價，生仁存涸，一致穿出一億大關。徐州生仁一〇二〇〇萬，計漲一千四百萬元。</p>
<p>食油　重告猛升，因黃豆上漲甚多，廠方感成本之加軍，亦堅持高價，散戶執主更扳持甚力，因其他物價之漲多，市勢一躍而升。豆油初開以一六二〇〇萬成交，中途退爲一五八〇〇萬，收市復迂迴出一六〇〇〇萬，終漲二千萬，生菜油亦挺二千萬光景，生油狂跳二千三百萬，吉桶生油一九八〇〇萬，已接近二億大關。小車蔴油加十五百萬。豆餅漲勢異軍突起，因受汕帮光頭，猛漲二百五十萬之鉅。</p>
<h3>金管局檢討　檢查行莊結果</h3>

<p>又前日該局公佈之十家犯過行莊，已分別飭令撤換其負責人，現悉此十家行莊中，已有先事更調其經協理及高級負責行員者，惟金管局爲追究責任起見，仍將進行調查，以肯定責任之誰屬，查明後將依法懲辦。</p>
<h3>華股臨收平疲　債市堅挺逾恒</h3>
<p>華股昨日初疲繼俏，惟幅度頗狹，勢呈盤旋。後以圈外物價趨昂，略現秀色，祗以傳有不利股市消息，銀根轉緊，臨收乃見平疲。</p>
<p>晨初永紗以一六四〇〇元上市，較昨收開高一〇〇元，六五號一六八號九二號二二〇號來進，雖升至一六六八〇元，乃以柏林局勢緊張，廬山會議等訊傳來，遂成趦趄不前之勢，並以適値週五，多方須負二天利息，始由二〇七號九九號六一號一五二號一七八號一八三號四八號等力售，浮空乘機而八，紛紛拋出，行市下游，退至一六一八〇元低價。空方有補，六五號一六九號二二六號七六號一五四號咸來維持，回升至一六四〇〇元。無如人心虛軟，缺乏襯託，經由三五號七一號六一號來買至一六二〇〇元。十時半後，傳紗布日用品昂騰驚人，市氣始轉興奮，買氣頓濃，空方恐懼力補，一一七號一八〇號七六號九八號一五五號來進，復升至一六六〇〇元。中度略有盤旋，雖有一一六號三五號五六號二〇六號來賣至一六三〇〇元，因人心好轉，二〇五號六五號二二八號一五四號一九三號一七八號七一號七八號一三號五四號俱來購買，散戶追踪於後，又趨上升，臨收若無中南銀行力售，永紗當不止以一五八〇〇元結束也。小型股如新光勤興景福因沉靜多時，而有人垂靑，秀色稍呈。結果較昨收計商務中法信誼閘北永公永地聯地漲停，景綸新華升半成强，除中泥跌停外，永紗新光景福等俱見微升。</p>
<p>午後買氣更濃，永紗即以一七三〇〇元登塲，一八七號六五號二〇七號一六八號等咸來拉抬，高升至一七六五〇元，初望其飛黃騰達，惜環境不利，國行差進萬餘億，銀根轉緊，謠言孔多，多方功虧一簣，其勢又頹。一一七號二一八號一五六號七一號一七六號一一六號一七八號二二四號等，紛售了結，雖尙呈盤旋，祇以時間已屆，永紗以一七〇五〇元終塲，結果較前收計中法中船信誼永地聯地漲停，餘均微升平織，塲外未上市各股票，均報漲一成二成不等。</p>
<p>公債　以改革幣制傳說更趨白熱化，累成俏利高峯，統丙初開一九〇萬元，即扶搖直昇，雖由三六〇室承德賣出，而五五二室五五〇室逢高有納，終升至二〇八萬元高價結束。。甲乙亦較前收升一成强，丁戊好起十四萬及十五萬元。</p>
<h3>安定金融减少游資　華北申匯又將限制</h3>
<p>〔商品調查所訊〕外傳：華北申匯又將限制，人心頗受影響。衆料此舉果付實行，本市銀根走勢，暫時有改觀可能。</p>
<p>又悉政府爲安定京滬金融，抽縮市間銀根起見，決定再度限制華北各地對於上海匯款額度。此項金融斷洗政策，似爲當務之急，當局將不再重視華北人士之反對，斷然于以措施。但一般觀測：斷洗以後，華北資金，必將改以現鈔運來，則北地鈔荒，恐將不堪設想。</p>
<p>〔聯合徽信所訊〕此間金融當局，爲協助政府平抑物價起見，對國家行局谷地匯滬款項，仍加以嚴格限制，以免游資集中，再度刺激市塲。過去每日匯滬總額，分別情形，减爲三千億或四千億，華北方面匯款亦將大量减少</p>
<h3>貼放會貿易委會　討論申請貸款案</h3>

<h3>國貨聯營公司　推廣海外市場</h3>
<p>中國國貨聯合營業公司，最近發表關於國貨外銷市塲，已頗昂蓬勃氣象，除棉紗布疋仍繼續運銷外，其他貨物，約分二類，一·爲設計擴充輸出範國者，有著名國產亞浦耳華德電燈泡，五和汗衫等十餘家。二·業有相當教量而擴大區域者，如華生電扇·中華琺瑯搪瓷器·永生水瓶·飛綸木紗·合成等廠毛巾·神魚紗襪·漢陽手帕等，以謀國貨在海外，得多方面之發展云。</p>
<h3>紗價壘出新高峰　龍頭細布迫近九千萬大關</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因銀根依然鬆弛，業外各物齊揚，本客帮爭先扒吸，同業互做不寂，籌碼枯燥，人心奇昂。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開時貨主居奇扳價，喊高至三億元，方肯賣出，買戶見價已達高峰，大都觀望不動。嗣悉靑島紗市上揚，客路津粵等帮活躍，走勢更硬，飛揚至卅三億五千萬現出，卅四億明日出結束，比之上日賡續狂漲三億五千萬元。其他各支粗細紗，亦均激升八九千萬至一億五六千萬元不一，成交八十件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開時受隔日紡建配價提高之刺激，更以籌碼不充，十二碼龍頭細布，市盤即告再騰八百萬元，旋以廬山商討經濟方案，及改革幣制等利賣消息，塲內人心頓疲，浮戶散多紛起吐售，北帮乘高亦賣，行情遂見回挫二十萬元。</p>
<p>詎至十點鐘後，同業中以銀根尙鬆，且天氣漸入秋凉，實銷將屆發動，客帮納胃轉强，新買亦來活動，龍頭市盤重漲至八千八百萬元結束，比上日步騰九百萬元，（塲外喊價再升三百五十萬元）。</p>
<p>中下檔五福喇叭童陽鶴等細布，染廠家有問津，因此漲勢相彷，其餘細斜粗布漂布及嗶嘰色布士林布等，亦莫不堅昂逾恒，成交一千八百疋。</p>
<p>又訊：午後塲外市勢盤挫，龍頭細布初喊九千二百五十萬元，新買不多，但乘高吐售不乏，市告盤低。迨最後則喊九千萬元站住，較之午收再升二百萬元，四君子元嗶嘰亦好一百七十萬元，惟成交殊稀。</p>

<p>珍眉·針眉·等綠茶，向以暢銷北菲蔚爲大宗，但自彼地出價慳吝以來，交易一度轉寂，惟邇因新華茶葉公司，旣首先獲得准予加價之覆電，間時聞午昌茶葉公司等，均據獲寬放茶價之函件，故黃納漸起，過程頓告復活，惜終受存底空盧之影響，頗離滿足需要，威交數量遂仍遜色。價格方面，更在結匯證上揚中，俏利逾但。至於祁門紅茶，庚續有求缺供。潛勢靜中露說。餘如炒靑烘靑兩檔毛茶，依然祇僅國內零星去化，形勢盤旋若昔。</p>
<h3>國藥需求沉寂</h3>
<p>國藥趨勢疲軟，本埠需求沉寂，外埠添配亦屬零碎，來源貨件，多有改裝小箱小包，以應時需者。猪苓從郵寄來達三十四包，客盤開出猪苓王四百萬元，貨祇六郵包，提猪苓價二百廿萬元，計八郵包，原猪苓價一百八十萬元，貨計二十郵包。</p>
<p>四腿虎骨昨來郵件六包，客方今日要求價開一千二百萬元，行方刻因銀根抽緊，一時尙無受主，况市情淸淡之間，致未還價。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>瀋陽　〔本報瀋陽十三日電〕藩新秋漲風突起，十三日高梁每斤四十萬元，大豆二〇萬，豬肉七〇萬，豆油八〇萬，兵船麵一八〇〇萬，伊支天女紗七德四千萬，大象烟每條一九〇萬，黃金開盤九五〇〇萬。（均流通券）</p>
<p>鎮江　〔本報鎭江十三日電〕鎮物價今又狂漲，上米五千六，小麥五千三，綠金山麵粉二千零五十萬，豆油每担一億六千萬，廿支醒獅小包五千八百五十萬，龍頭細布九千四百萬。五洋較昨漲二成，飾金進五億，出五億六。</p>
<h3>出口物資價格上漲　上週出口結匯三百餘萬美元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會頃就上週內我國主要出口商品之國內外行情，分類作扼要發表如下：</p>
<p>本週（八月一日至七日）上半週，銀根頗緊，一般物價穩定，下半週物價全面動升，桐油，豬鬃，生絲，紗布，棉織品，油籽，等主要出口品，亦告上揚，週杪尤萬，致本週出口貨物，平均較上週約漲百分之一五，國外行市除桐油花生油等下跌外，餘尙平穩。結匯證書市氣亦佳，週杪竟破七百萬關，全週平均則約爲五，六五〇，〇〇〇元，較上週漲百分之四四。對於輸出刺激良多，茲擇數項主要出口品，略誌其國內外行市情形。</p>
<p>桐油　國內價格上升頗烈，足桐油每市担自一億元漲至一億五五，本週內即增五成，國外價格反步跌，週杪紐約每磅已跌至美金二角，倫敦每英噸一四八英磅。其原因傳係某有力出口商在美低價拋售所致，一般出口商對結匯證看好，而貶價出售與華南走私出口亦有影響。</p>
<p>豬鬃　成本亦漸高，週初上海漢口豬鬃每司馬担各升爲一五億及一七億，分別漲兩三成以上，市况不穩。週杪上海十七號猛升至二一億，國外價格甚平穩，因結匯證價挺升，滬漢各色豬鬃出口可獲利一成至三成不等，天津鬃則虧損至百分之二三，出口尙活躍，上月份輸出即達三千担，最大市塲仍在美國</p>
<p>茶葉　新貨已上市，本週紅茶及綠茶各漲四成及三成，按結匯證計算紅茶雖稍虧，綠茶外銷仍有利，新茶在中農行茶貸協助下，品質轉佳，但產量僅及去年七成，貨樣寄往外國洋商雖感滿意，但還價慳吝，難望做開，故洋莊茶市近呈枯寂。</p>
<p>生絲　週來漲勢頗厲，B級八三勻度廠絲，每包週初爲二四億五，週六漲至二九億五，漲百分之二〇，國外紐約每磅仍爲美金三元三，出口虧損甚大，外銷極呆滯。日絲近漸抬頭，就銷又添勁敵，惟法國生絲進口商，對我絲如金雙鹿牌等仍具好感。</p>
<p>羽毛　乾腸衣等行市尚穩，結匯證實價上漲，出口均有利。</p>
<p>豆類　籽仁國內價格步漲，大豆蠶豆各升三成，芝蔴采子陡漲五成，芝蔴輸出勉數成本，餘均有虧損，油類市價亦上升約二·三成，除菜子油可獲利一成外，餘均有一成左右損失。</p>
<p>大黃　國外無需要，麝香無買主，五棓子，樟腦，輸出均各無利。</p>
<p>結匯　至本週（八月一日至七日）上海一埠，出口商請求結匯情形，業經統計完竣，其總額較上週稍减，總數達美金三，四〇二，六七三·〇四元。其中結售於普通指定銀行者一，五八九，三四九·三〇美元，政府自行結匯者一，八一三，三二三·七四美元。</p>
<p>如就商品而分，則包括猪鬃五七六，二二〇·八九美元，桐油二三·六〇美元，毛皮四五，三四二·七七美元，靑油三，七三二·〇〇美元，茶四五，二五二·八二美元，草帽四二，六二七·三九美元，猪腸衣六，五九六·一〇美元，羽毛二〇，六一一·三六美元，金屬及其製品一八，一七七·〇七美元，毛綫及生絲一，八六七·五〇美元，鮮蛋等二六，二七三·八五美元，棉織物七四，二四二·六一美元，羊毛三九，二一二·九三美元，絲織品二一，三〇五·二〇美元，蔬菜及其產品一六，二九四·八〇美元，雜項六五一，五六八·四一美元，冰蛋二〇四，九六二·〇八美元，棉布一，二四六，二〇一·一五美元，棉紗三六二，一六〇·五一美元云。</p>

<h3>世運大會今夕閉幕　我國籃球列十八名　足球決賽瑞典擊敗南國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教十三日廣播：世運足球決賽，瑞典勝南斯拉夫三比一得冠軍。丹麥勝英國。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教十三日廣播：世運籃球賽，墨西哥勝巴西，上半時廿五比十七分。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：第十四屆奧林匹克世運大會十四日閉幕，下午六時行閉幕禮，全部比賽，俱告結束。十四日上下午尙有馬術比賽，在溫布萊大體育塲舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：世運籃球賽第三部名次決賽，中國隊以士卒離心，不能與鬥志堅强之義大利抗衡，鏖戰結果，以卅八比五十四敗陣，上半時廿五比廿一，中國落後四分。義大利得第三部冠軍，列第十七名，中國屈居第十八。中國隊六呎二吋之後衛黃天錫，已先期離英，使替補原已短絀之中國後防，更覺提襟見肘。全部隊員，以言旋在即，歸心似箭，亦爲鬥志消沉之一因。開賽中國隊以包松國，李震中，蔡文華，李世僑，吳成章出戰。賽初尙能有水準以上演出，松圓，成章，籃下屢屢得分，世僑，文華亦偶有佳作，得以着着佔先。但中國上風局勢，僅如曇花一現，十五分後，中國隊員，體力已漸感不支，義大利乘機苦追，分數自接近而平手，再而超出，中國頻以後備員替補，仍無起色，此後即一蹶不振。上半時義大利以廿五比廿一後來居上。易籃後，賈致軍替出文華，蔡忠强入代世僑，此數員生力軍，抵英後極少上塲機會，故演來極爲努力，但義大利亦以全力相拚，毫不放鬆。卅八比廿五時，忠强罰入，義大利立還一球。老包犯規，義隊又添一分，中國後衛，老包每好雕防遠出，大李又入衰竭之境，有數次義鋒得球直衝，縱橫中國籃下，竟如入無人之境。四十五對廿九時，老包遠托未進，忠强籃下三拍不入，反被義隊偷得二分，中國隊敗勢已成，僅略示掙扎，以盡人事，終塲中國以卅八比五十四輸八球。</p>
<h3>中國世運失敗　體格相差太遠　許民輝李惠堂廣播</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：第十四屆奧林匹克運動會明日閉幕，中國代表團已整裝候機返國，英國廣播公司特派記者訪問該團指導及敎練，請發表此行感想，並將談話製成錄音片，假英國廣播電台向遠東廣播。</p>
<p>躬與上屆大會之體壇元老游泳指導兼敎練許民輝氏，認爲中國人之未能在體育上與歐美各國爭短長，先天體格不够强健，實爲主因。許氏談稱：「大會田徑賽和其他運動，中國都未能獲分，實在因爲體格與歐美人根本相差太遠。田賽中的三鐵，更顯而易見，絕難與歐美人比較。徑賽方面，略較接近，中欄成績相差雖然不遠，但四百米陳英郎僅以一臂之差，列第三被淘汰，實在可惜。棋文敖的萬米賽，應該得分，不幸因爲種種阻難，竟然失敗。最後一日在馬拉松中力拼，雖然因體力關係，未畢全程，但前半一直居領導地位，雖敗猶榮。黃·陳·樓諸選手，倘能更加努力，我一九五三年第十五屆大會中，極有得分希望。」</p>
<p>上屆世運足球隊長，本屈足球敎練李惠堂，亦以爲中國足球之未達世界水準，體力爲最大影饗。談及戰術，據稱：「目前歐洲諸强，採用第三後衛守法，但尙未到家，一遇較堅强之敵鋒，便易散亂。中國隊最大弱點，仍是體力與氣力之遠不如人。此次首次出師，連輸四球，體力佔極大因素。中國足球要能達到世界水準，必須提拔後進，並注意體格之根本改進。最好能取法歐洲各國，騁請英國敎練回國，訓練新人材。」</p>

<h3>變更國際籃球規則　防止長人佔便宜　放寬罰球區域採用三秒鐘規定　國際籃協小組會通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：國際業餘籃球會規程小組委員會星期三投票決定，將罰球區域近籃下之狹長段闊度，自六呎放寬至十二呎，希望能够予較矮的後衛以帮助，减少七尺巨人將球放入籃圈的機會。這項變更，可能是廿年來最前進的規程改革。</p>
<p>美國的「三秒鐘規定」也同時被採納。這項規定，將使所有球員俱不能在罰球區內，作三秒鐘以上的停留。小組委員會雖未特別宣佈採取這項規則的動機，但明顯地，「三秒鐘規定」，是防止七尺巨人立在籃下作「守籃員」，阻止皮球進入籃圈。依照新規定，罰球區域將成城門形，罰球時在球未碰籃板或籃圈之前，所有球員俱不准進入「城門區」，球碰籃板後，球員當然可以衝入搶球，但仍不得作三秒鐘以上的停留。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>說色厲內荏</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>天氣悶極了，雖然到了立秋，還一點風凉的意思沒有，只有偃臥匡床，看點不費腦筋的東西。昨天翻看我佛山人二十年目覩之怪現狀，此本極普通的書，但在今日特別是像我們稍微經過一點滄桑的人看來，却是別有意味，不覺對於吳君更加傾倒了。</p>
<p>此書後半部雖仍是切成片片，但似大半都以「苟才」爲代表。苟才大約亦即全書人物的Typical者也。當他在安慶省城巴結上銀元局的差使，發了大財之後，忽然來了五省欽差，查辦各項舞弊案件，欽差初到，非常風厲，據說是不走人情的，但到後來終於被苟才找到門子，花了六十萬雪花銀，竟得無罪。書中批評此欽差，乃是「色厲內荏」的人，這四個字不覺使我頗有動於中。</p>
<p>南亭亭長官塲現形記中記查參案的欽差更多，其結果均與此九省欽差相類似，幾乎也就成了公式。有一次一個欽差是絕對不會客不發言的，更使人莫測高深，後來碰到一位內行，說這呌做「彎弓不放箭」，其所以不放者，善價而沽也，到底由幾個掮客的拉攏，各人均滿足了自己的要求。</p>
<p>我們考查內荏者的身分，恐怕以「讀書種子」爲多，這裏面的緣故，眞是「頗可以深長思」的。</p>
<p>孔子不能說不風属，少正卯正兩觀之誅，放鄭聲遠佞人，連紫色都犯了不是，爲的是他奪了朱。可是等到失勢遠行，到了衛國爲什麼要去見什麼寡小君呢？弄得子路都大不開心，後世「離經叛道」之徒，更樂得加油加醬，把「環珮之聲璆然」演成曲本，唐突聖人。就連我這樣守規矩的人，也有點不免致疑他老先生的「不接浙而行」和不肯與雍沮同乘是別有原因了！這個問題很簡單，讀書人以一致君堯舜」爲天職，久而久之，就弄得「四體不勸，五毅不分」，只會充「夫子」；因此一旦失了業，除去僕僕風塵，「出疆必載贊」以外，便賸下「皇皇如也」了。</p>
<p>當然，理直則氣壯，孟子所說的「積義而生」，「其爲氣也，至大至剛，可以塞於天地之間」，按理說，讀書人該當積的義頂多，其氣也該最剛最大，則無所謂荏；然而知識不一定全是義，還附帶讓人懂得「利害」。利害若以個人爲出發點，無疑的，便會和義正相矛盾。所以到了見危授命的時候，他就會想到刀子割到脛子上是何等難過，而且會證實了楊朱「生則桀紂，死則腐骨；生則堯舜，死則腐骨。腐骨一也，孰知其異？」的哲學。前者或許引車販漿者洗都曉得，後者可是只有喝過墨水的人才想得透了。故古人所說「從容就死難」者，以其當從容之頃，大有餘閒可以計較到這些問題，於是百鍊鋼亦會化爲繞指柔，而弄得意氣消沉了。反之，沒有這些考慮的販夫走卒，他們大約只識得一條道理，什麼「有恩必報」或是「恩怨分明」，在一鼓作氣之下，反而可以幹出驚天動地的事來。吳梅村鹿樵紀聞下卷「虞淵墜」中，專設兩章談這些人，臂如「僕隸」一章，紀提督曹存性要自南京降滿洲，偏偏其卒不肯降，投橋下而死；安遠侯柳昌祚降豫王，也有一卒止之，不聽投河而死；類此事實很多。「乞兒」一章，那個不肯投降北軍的秦淮乞兒還在臨死之前題詩一首，「三百年來養士朝，如何文武盡皆逃？綱常留在卑田院，乞丐羞存命一條！」這詩顯然是後人的誇飾，就連事實也許得打折扣，不過這樣却對照了提督侯爵，是一大諷刺而已。所可惜者，吳君個人亦是色厲而內荏，終於「一錢不値」的作了什麼「祭酒」了！</p>
<p>這就叫做「義利之辨，難言之矣！」</p>
<h3>醇酒婦人·生活豪華　印度的藩王</h3>
<p>— 烟波</p>
<p>去年八月十五日，印度得到了獨立，全印分爲兩個國家：一個是印度，一個是巴基斯坦，這是大家都知道的了。</p>
<p>但是，在去年八月十五日以前，印度實在早已不止一個國家。大英帝國統治印度的時候，是用了五百六十三套法律的，產生了甘地和尼赫魯的印度，不過是這五百六十三國之一，此外的五百六十二國就是大大小小的藩邦。印回分治之後，五百個藩邦加入了印度，六十一個藩邦加人了巴基斯坦，祇有一個最大也最富的海地拉巴藩邦却仍舊照老樣子，算是獨立的。</p>
<p>印度政府準備把這五百個藩邦合併爲二十五個單位，副首相兼內政部長巴泰爾認爲非如此不足以推行民主制度；但尼赫魯却力主維持這些藩主的權利，祇要他們承認新印度國的統治權，讓印度政府來堂管外交，軍事，交通，那麼他們仍舊可以維持原來的地位。</p>
<p>這些藩邦的統治者欣然同意，每年仍舊收取九百萬美元的俸祿，但是，以前的豪華生活却已經不大能够再過下去了。</p>
<p>美國生活畫報的駐印記者菲歇（已故），曾紀錄過這些印度藩王們富貴淫逸的故事，成爲專著，這裏摘譯幾節，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>這些藩王們很喜歡新奇好玩的東西。有一個藩王特地製造了一具機器，祗要手按機鈕，房間裏立刻佈滿了各種香水的香味。印度極熱，蚊蟲很多，有時那位藩王受不了蚊蟲之擾，就在那具機器上按一下另外一個機鈕，房間裏就馬上充滿了飛力脫殺蟲水的細點了。</p>
<p>另外一個藩王在宴客的時候，餐廳中央長圓形餐桌上常有一輛小型的飛車環繞駛行，電車上裝滿了各色美酒，客人拿起一個酒瓶，電車就自動停止，等客人倒好了酒把酒瓶歸還原處，那輛電車就又馬上前進了。</p>
<p>一個藩王喜歡養狗，特地建築了無數精美的「犬室」，用了大隊人員侍奉這些狗。有時藩王出遊海上，那些狗就另乘一艘專輪，追隨左右。這位藩王也喜歡打獵，每出獵時必先動員大批人員爲他佈置，有接見下屬的蓬帳，專門洗澡用的蓬帳，男女侍者的蓬帳，藩王安息的蓬帳——用各色絲鍋裝飾，地下還舖了極厚的地毯。</p>
<p>這些藩王當然都是「飽暖」的人，下面就要談到女人問題了。</p>
<p>有一個萍邦呌巴喜阿拉，巴喜阿拉有過一位藩王，他娶了五十二位太太，養了三百五十個孩子。他給每一位太太一萬羅比作爲騁金，另外再給一萬羅比供她添置衣服。這一筆費用當然可觀，他就向老百姓增收捐稅：他一個人左擁右抱，老百姓却弄得焦頭爛額。</p>
<p>這位藩王死後，他留下的五十二位太太都被遣送回籍，另外特地在宮中造起一個孤兒院來，收容這三百五十位世子。但巴喜阿拉邦的官民大衆對這些孩子的出身極爲重視，凡前王各位「正式」太太所養的孩子，一律雇用英國阿媽，出進王宮時都走前門；而「非正式」太太們所養的孩子却一律雇用印度阿媽，孩子們如果想到宮外去玩，就祇能後門進出。</p>
<p>上文提起過的全印最大藩邦海地拉巴的大藩王，今年已經七十二歲，戴眼鏡，身裁瘦小，却還非常風洗，現有正式太太四位，姨太太兩百位左右。此老愛財若命，大家說他是全世界最有錢的人，也是最不堪領敎的守財奴。他的太太固然不少，但他自己却住的是蹩脚的房子，穿的是破舊的衣服。有一天一位官員去見他，他正好在午睡，那個官員眉頭一縐，計上心來，不慌不忙地拿出了兩個銀幣，在那位全世界最有錢的大富翁耳邊輕輕地一碰，兩個銀幣發出了淸脆可聽的叮噹聲音——但見那位大藩王好像抖擻，頓時睡意全無！</p>
<h3>離婚的理由</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>在伊里薩貝斯地方，一個婦人提起離婚的理由是：「他每晚給我五塊錢，當我睡着了，他偷偷地盜去，一到早上反叱責我不小心！」她哭訴着說。</p>
<p>美國惠斯康幸城，一偶女人要求和她的丈夫離婚，理由是：她和她的丈夫（一個海軍退伍軍官）結婚以後，每天要睡在吊床裏，她在二十三年中曾經墜下過十六次，現在年齡較大，不能再忍受墜跌的痛楚。</p>
<p>有一個落杉磯的丈夫，向法庭投訴說：「每次我向妻求愛的時候，她便向我要求五元一吻的代價。於是五元，五元，五元……這樣的數字是我所負担不了的。」</p>
<p>寡人有疾　這是印度最大的藩邦海地拉巴的藩王，高壽七十二，有太太四位，姨太太二百位。此老愛財如命，擁貲極富，有人說他是全世界最大的富翁。（請參閱「印度的藩王」一文。）</p>

<h3>上海樂壇創奇跡　口琴擠進交響樂</h3>
<p>— 友亭</p>
<p>梅百器（Maestro　Pacl）逝世剛兩年，他所艱辛創辦的交響樂隊（即前之工部局樂隊，今之滬市府樂團），便已日益衰小，小提琴名手阿特勒，大提琴名家杜克生相繼回國，名指揮兼有名鋼琴家馬戈林斯基也早就離開；今天的市府樂團，剩下二三十個的隊員，待遇旣差，管理亦懈，夏季以來開過兩次夏季音樂會，都屬無精打采。</p>
<p>昨晚（八月十一日），該樂團的夏季第二次交響樂會，其中有一「驚人」節目：口琴獨奏，由交響樂伴奏事屬創舉，我只好從虹口區趕到法國學校，一聽究竟，滿以爲此獨奏之口琴，必屬「原子」，「超級」之類，孰知原不過通常的半音階口琴而已，凡是使口琴不能列爲正式樂器之缺點，該半音階口琴也全都具備，所以雖經單獨用一隻「麥克風」放大其昔量，但奏來仍舊極不調和。第一曲克勒斯勒所作「維也納幻想曲」，獨奏者除能以口琴顯示其快連旋律的技巧外，其他都平淡無味，且因口琴係通過了「麥克風」，而其他伴奏的樂器則與「麥克風」隔離，所以在音量上尤覺脫節。這一個「標新立異」的節目，殘害了藝術水準，又虐待了無數聽衆的耳朶！</p>
<p>大家都知道：（一）口琴發音，只賴一吹一吸，表現旋律，極受限制，例如一速幾個音符都屬吹出或吸入者，而且又全是延續不斷的節拍，那就非人類的肺量所堪忍受了；（二）口琴音色乾燥，薄弱而單調，無從表現音樂上感情的緊弛與色彩的濃淡，即使不顧音樂的常軌，通過了麥克風來演奏，也只能放大音量，並不能改善音色；（三）通過了「麥克風」的口琴，其音色頗近似管弦樂隊中的以簧發音的管樂器，但在音色，音量，音域上，這些管樂器比口琴進步完備，其他弦樂器的能力，當然更遠勝口琴，是故以交饗樂伴奏口琴，無異敎人聽伴奏而放棄主調。即在爵士音樂風行的美國，也不過把吉他Saxophone等列入樂隊，很少看見一個正統的樂隊爲「口琴獨奏」的伴奏。當然，口琴的大合奏，種以手風琴，鋼琴或其他管弦樂器，這是常有的事，所謂口琴的交響樂團，上海也有。不過這些交響樂曲必須經過改編，並非原來面目（這次市府樂團的口琴獨奏，曲子也經過改編了的）。口琴大合奏的交響樂與真正管弦樂隊奏出的交響樂的差別，讀者均可在收音機旁聽之，聽後便可明瞭：口琴是「音樂玩具」呢，還是正式樂器？它應否由一個正統的交響樂隊來伴奏？</p>
<p>當然，樂團負責的西籍音樂家，並非連上述這些道理都不懂，只不過：一則係受獨奏者的一再要求，二則今日之下，種種困難（說來話長），節目方面遂難免濫竽充數。</p>
<p>其中自不無情有可原之處，但爲上海這東方第一大都市的藝術以及民族的下一代着想，我們實在不能緘默下去了。</p>

<h3>General MacArthur and Wife to Fly to Seoul Tomorrow to Attend South Korean Government Inauguration Ceremony; US Troops to Remain in South Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] The US Military Headquarters here announced today that General MacArthur and his wife have accepted President Syngman Rhee's invitation to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new South Korean government on the 15th. General MacArthur will arrive by plane from Tokyo on the same day and return to Japan by the same plane after the ceremony. In his reply to Rhee, MacArthur stated: "My wife and I are delighted to be invited to visit Korea and are deeply honored to witness the great event of your country's free birth. This grand occasion will surely resonate with joy in the hearts of every American. This ceremony also serves as a demonstration of the great success of your decades of unyielding struggle. Please accept my sincerest congratulations."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The United States has de facto recognized the South Korean government today and appointed John J. Muccio as the Special Representative with the rank of Ambassador stationed in Seoul. The State Department's statement said: The Korean government in Seoul was formed in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 14, 1947, and should therefore be recognized as the government of Korea. It is hoped that the Korean people north of the 38th parallel will be able to freely participate in this government at an appropriate time. State Department officials declined to comment on reports from Nanjing that the Chinese authorities have provisionally recognized the Seoul government, stating that the United States has informed the eight countries in the UN delegation to Korea of this action: China, Australia, the Philippines, Syria, India, Canada, France, El Salvador, and the United Kingdom, a signatory to the Cairo Declaration. The United States has also informed the head of the UN delegation to Korea, who is currently in Seoul, of this move. The Ukrainian representative, who was originally nominated as a member of the delegation to Korea but refused to go, has not been notified. The State Department spokesman continued: John J. Muccio is a career diplomat who has worked in the US consulates in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Fuzhou, and Kunming for more than eight years. Mr. Muccio is currently on the West Coast of the United States and will soon depart for Seoul. (The full text of the US State Department statement is published on page 3)</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Government officials predicted on the 12th that US troops will continue to be stationed in South Korea until the new South Korean government believes it is strong enough to resist any communist coup attempts. The Soviet Union still occupies North Korea. Officials stated that the policy of withdrawing US occupation forces from Korea will be decided in negotiations with South Korean President Syngman Rhee. The US government formally recognized this government as the "Government of Korea" on the evening of the 12th. However, a rival "leftist" government is about to be elected in North Korea this month, which means that there will be a Soviet-recognized North Korean government and a US-recognized South Korean government in Korea. Both governments claim to speak for the Korean people. This troubled country, which gained liberation from Japanese rule only three years ago, will be presented at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris in mid-September this year. President Syngman Rhee said on the 12th that, given the current situation, he requests that US troops remain stationed in Korea indefinitely. However, just six months ago, Rhee was still demanding the immediate withdrawal of US occupation forces from Korea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] The Cairo Declaration by China, Britain, and the United States stipulates that Korea be granted independence. China, one of the three countries, has provisionally recognized the South Korean government established on August 15. The Chinese note was delivered to President Syngman Rhee by Liu Yuwan, representative of the Chinese Ambassador to Korea, at 7:05 PM on the 13th. It is generally expected that the Philippines will follow China's lead and grant provisional recognition as well. President Rhee stated that he deeply appreciates President Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Wang's goodwill in supporting the new government of the Republic of Korea. For hundreds of years, China and Korea have not only been friendly with each other but have also been brotherly nations. Therefore, China and Korea, two Far Eastern countries, should support each other to promote peace and prosperity. Rhee also stated that he hopes China and Korea can help each other solve the communist problem.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Representing the National Diplomacy Association and the Chinese Catholic Cultural Advancement Association, participated in the establishment of the Korean government</p>
<h3>Chang Chun's Visit to Japan Seems Likely; Our Delegation to Japan Has Not Received Any News</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Shang Zhen, head of our delegation to Japan, stated that he has not yet received any news from our government regarding the rumored visit of former Premier Chang Chun to Japan, but Chang's visit to Japan seems likely.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 12th] Political observers here commented on the recognition of the Seoul government by China, Britain, and the United States, saying that since the end of the war, the Chinese government has clearly stood on the side of the Western powers and resolutely made decisions on major issues in the Far East, which is equivalent to directly opposing the Soviet Union's point of view. This is a first. Sources said that Chang Chun will soon go to Korea and then to Japan, or even to Indonesia and Myanmar. Chang will meet with South Korean Prime Minister Lee Bum Suk in Korea, who will be inaugurated on the 15th of this month. General elections will be held in the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea on the 25th of this month. Chang will meet with leaders of major political parties in Japan, or may meet with General MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito. According to some sources, Chang's main goal in going to Japan is to arrange a meeting between General MacArthur and President Chiang Kai-shek. Chang's trip will last about a month, after which he may go to the United States to negotiate US aid to China with US government authorities. However, government sources claim that Chang does not have a formal mission.</p>
<h3>US Aid Joint Meeting; Cotton Yarn Exchange Rate Determined; Agreement Also Reached on the Use of Grain and Petroleum</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Division of the US Economic Cooperation Administration held their third joint meeting at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 Official Residence at 3:00 PM on the 13th. Those attending from our side included members of the US Aid Utilization Committee Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Wang Yunwu, Wang Shijie (represented by Dong Lin), Yan Jiagan, Li Gan, Shen Xirui, and Wu Xuelan. Those attending from the US side included Lapham, Gilpatrick, Cushman, and more than ten others. Our Minister of Food, Guan Jiyu, was also invited to participate. Premier Weng Wenhao presided over the meeting. In addition to reporting on recent business, the two sides agreed on the following three points regarding the use of US aid materials: (1) Regarding cotton, they expressed acceptance of the eight distribution principles decided by the cotton group (see below). Regarding the exchange ratio between cotton and cotton yarn, it was stipulated that each bale of cotton yarn would be exchanged for 599 pounds of cotton. The standard for cotton is 7/8-inch non-lint American cotton, and the standard for cotton yarn is 20-count export cotton yarn, limited to the first phase of US aid cotton. The US side hopes that the implementing agency must be jointly run by the China Division of the US Economic Cooperation Administration and the US Aid Utilization Committee. (2) Regarding grain, in addition to supplying the five major cities participating in rationing, it was also decided to supply Qingdao as much as possible due to the special circumstances in Qingdao and the blockage of nearby grain sources. (3) Regarding petroleum, it was decided to supply public utilities, and the price will be determined by personnel designated by the US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Division of the US Economic Cooperation Administration. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The eight cotton distribution principles decided by the Cotton Group Meeting can be summarized as follows: (1) The distribution of US aid cotton is specifically for spinning 20-count or finer cotton yarn. (2) To the extent possible, raw cotton should be exchanged for cotton yarn or cotton cloth on the same basis. However, if the yarn factory does not have ready-made cotton yarn or cotton cloth, the distribution agency can still allocate cotton and then the factory will hand over the cotton yarn or cotton cloth within a certain period of time (i.e., the time required for manufacturing). (3) The allocation of US aid cotton is limited to yarn factories that do not have enough cotton to supply for two months. Each allocation shall not exceed the factory's needs for one month, but the remaining cotton in the factory shall not be counted. (4) Superior long-fiber cotton should be allocated to factories with tools to utilize it. The cotton yarn or cotton cloth spun from it, whether for domestic or foreign sales, must meet the standards set by the aid cotton distribution agency. (5) After a factory accepts the allocation of US aid cotton, it should immediately be made into cotton yarn or cloth, and the allocated cotton must not be sold. (6) All aid cotton allocations will be picked up from warehouses in the port of entry, and the exchanged yarn or cloth should also be carried out in the same seaport warehouse. (7) The total amount allocated to each factory is determined by the ratio of the factory's spindles at the time of commissioning and all spindles spinning American cotton. (8) When applying for the allocation of cotton, each factory can apply in writing to the Cotton Group.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The issue of the use of funds after the sale of US aid materials was not raised for discussion at the joint meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. It will be discussed after accurate statistics are available. However, off-site exchanges of opinions are still in progress.</p>
<h3>Buckwheat Airlifted to Shenyang</h3>
<p>US Aid Wheat Continues to Arrive in Tianjin</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] Starting from the 13th, the China Division of the US Economic Cooperation Administration has successively airlifted 96 tons of buckwheat from Pinglu to Shenyang as seeds for distribution to disaster-stricken farmers to remedy the damage caused by aphids in the Liaoyang area. The Northeast Political Committee's Farmland Water Conservancy Department convened relevant parties this morning to discuss distribution methods.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] More than 8,000 tons of US aid wheat, shipped by the US ships "United Merchant" and "United Seafarer," have arrived outside Dagukou one after another. The China Merchants Bureau is currently dispatching barges to transport them to Tianjin for distribution by the Flour Milling Industry Association. It is reported that this batch of wheat is enough for the factories to grind for one month.</p>
<h3>Finance Ministry Forbids the Establishment of New Banks and Brokers in More Than 20 Cities and Ports Such as Beijing and Shanghai; The Capital Amount for Permitted Establishment Areas to be Increased</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] In order to control credit and regulate finance to achieve the purpose of stabilizing the economy, the Ministry of Finance has decided to impose strict restrictions on the establishment of banks and brokers in the future, in addition to rectifying financial institutions and inspecting banks and brokers. The opinions of the key members of the Ministry of Finance who went to Japan for discussions are completely consistent on the issue of restricting the establishment of new banks and brokers in the future. They all advocate that in fact, no new banks and brokers should be established from today. However, the method is to restrict the establishment area and increase the capital amount. Based on this important principle, the specific methods and implementation details are also being studied and will be finalized soon and submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion and approval for implementation. The content of the measures will include two major points. One is to restrict the area of establishment, stipulating that except for the inland and remote provinces and cities, the establishment of new banks and brokers is absolutely prohibited in all major cities and commercial ports across the country. The other is to increase the capital amount for the establishment of new banks and brokers. Those who establish new banks and brokers in inland and remote provinces and cities should reach the standard of the pre-war capital amount. According to the new regulations, new banks and brokers are not allowed to be established in any circumstances in more than 20 major cities and commercial ports across the country, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Pingjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Xunyang, and Changsha, Xi'an, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Suzhou, Shenyang, etc. As for other provinces, the inland and remote provinces are allowed to establish banks and brokers, and the method of increasing the capital amount is based on the capital amount of the pre-war banks and brokers as the base, and then calculate the highest base of the bank in legal tender according to the current living index of public education employees in the Beijing-Shanghai area, which is 500,000 yuan, followed by 200,000 yuan, and the lowest base of the bank is 50,000 yuan. The living index is based on the living index of the current month at the time of establishment. For example, the living index in the Beijing-Shanghai area in July is 1.6 million times, then the bank with a base of 500,000 yuan must have a capital amount of 800 billion yuan to be allowed to establish, and the commercial bank's attached industry department and savings and credit department should increase its capital amount by one-half for each attached department compared to the original capital amount. It is reported that this restriction on the establishment of new banks and brokers and the increase in the capital amount of banks and brokers were proposed by the Ministry of Finance in the past and submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. Later, it was handed over to the National Economic Committee for review, but it was shelved due to the end of the National Economic Committee until now. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly requested instructions from the Executive Yuan. A few days ago, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to formulate new measures as soon as possible. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Finance gathered several key members to study in detail. After determining the above principles, it is formulating specific measures based on these principles. After the plan is finalized, it can be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. In the midst of the rectification of banks and brokers, the heads of the Ministry of Finance are determined to strictly restrict the establishment of new banks and brokers.</p>

<h3>Tuition Fees, Teachers' Livelihoods, and the Education System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai educational authorities have invited dozens of principals, faculty representatives, parents, and prominent figures in the education community from both public and private schools to hold a symposium today. Each will express their opinions from their own perspectives on the issue of tuition standards for the next semester. Although no resolutions will be made, this can serve as a reference for the educational authorities in determining the fee standards for the next semester.</p>
<p>The summer vacation is fleeting, and the first semester of the 37th year is about to begin. The issue of tuition fees for public and private schools is not only a concern for parents with children attending school, but also for all those who care about the education of the next generation. Everyone hopes that the educational authorities can set a relatively reasonable standard. We would like to take this opportunity to express our views on this issue as the symposium is being held.</p>
<p>In today's world of rampant and endless inflation, except for a few wealthy families, the vast majority of families in Shanghai are feeling the pressure of high prices and threatened livelihoods. They simply cannot afford their children's education. Hearing that the tuition fees for the next semester will be based on the price of rice, parents are panicking and worrying about their children's tuition fees when school starts next semester, some even to the point of insomnia. Starting school seems like a difficult hurdle for these parents. The closer the start of school gets, the more their frowns deepen. As for the majority of students, they not only feel uneasy because of their parents' worries, but also panic because they may have to drop out of school. Therefore, from the perspective of students and parents, they naturally advocate for the tuition standards to be set as low as possible, and even oppose the schools' method of collecting "one unit of rice" as tuition. However, turning around and looking at the difficult lives of the general faculty members, it is inevitable to feel that this argument is not entirely fair.</p>
<p>Teachers are the nannies who cultivate the talents of the next generation. They not only make supreme contributions to the nation and country, but also serve as role models for the current society. In theory, everyone should respect the position of teachers, and teachers themselves naturally regard it as a sacred career. However, the poverty of teachers' lives in our country has always been the case, and it is even worse today. Although the country has long had plans to improve teachers' salaries, things have not gone as desired. Teachers' salaries have not only not improved, but have instead deteriorated. Today, some teachers' monthly income cannot even support their own lives, let alone support their families. How can we expect teachers to educate the next generation of citizens with peace of mind in such a life? The last semester has passed, and the teachers' salaries must be improved in the next semester. This is a matter of course, and no one can oppose it. The source of funds for private schools usually comes from tuition fees. The board of directors usually does not bear any responsibility, so from the perspective of teachers, one has to sympathize with the schools' request to raise tuition standards.</p>
<p>Taking care of the burden on parents means not taking care of the teachers' livelihoods, and vice versa. This contradictory phenomenon would not be difficult to solve if the country were at peace. As long as the country establishes more schools, especially primary and secondary schools, and subsidizes private schools more, it can take care of both the burden on parents and the lives of teachers. However, today, we happen to be in a time of national crisis. Whether it is the central or local government, finances and economies are extremely difficult. Apart from basic education, it is impossible for the government to take on the entire responsibility of educating the next generation of youth. Therefore, the issue of school fees has become a major problem today. Parents, students, principals, teachers, and the country and society are all troubled and anxious about this issue. But how should this problem be solved in a reasonable way? We believe that as long as the four parties—the state, society, parents, and schools—can cooperate, and they can recognize that there should be flexible solutions in times of crisis, it will not be difficult to find a reasonable solution. Let us first propose some methods for the reference of those who are enthusiastic about education.</p>
<p>First, the finances of every school, whether public or private, should be absolutely transparent, and expenditures should be based on income. Teachers' salaries and administrative expenses should be in a fixed proportion, preferably a ratio of 8:2 or 7:3. Under this method, students can pay the lowest tuition fees, and teachers can receive the highest salaries. In the past, in some schools, because the finances were not transparent, teachers' salaries were not necessarily increased in proportion to the tuition fees. In other words, the burden on parents was increased, but the teachers' salaries were not increased. All tuition income may have only filled the pockets of a few principals. Such people are truly the scum of the Shanghai education community and the shame of the Shanghai cultural community. Therefore, we hope that the educational authorities can strengthen the supervision of the finances of private schools and ensure that they are transparent. All tuition income, except for administrative expenses, should be shared by all teachers. In any case, principals must never be allowed to exploit teachers again in the future. At the same time, we hope that teachers will come forward with solid evidence to report principals who do not have transparent finances, so that the proper proportion of tuition income can be used as teachers' salaries.</p>
<p>Second, the educational authorities should, to the extent possible, strive for the percentage of cultural and educational funding that should be obtained in the budget, as stipulated by the Constitution. Within the limits of the necessary funding, the spirit of "collecting every drop for public use" should be used to add more public schools and recruit as many poor students as possible. Also, private schools with outstanding achievements should be given more subsidies to be used for adding equipment. By no means should the only way to maintain schools be to simply allow them to raise tuition fees, causing countless outstanding poor students to be discouraged.</p>
<p>Third, the society should also universally launch a student aid movement to rescue out-of-school youth and establish scholarships and bursaries in various schools. For example, the "Reader Student Aid Movement" launched by this newspaper has been going on for a long time, and the amount of student aid obtained seems to be considerable. This shows that there are quite a few people in the society who recognize that "helping students is the greatest joy." We hope that all sectors of society can, in the spirit of "loving the young as we love our own," launch a student aid movement, so that no matter how expensive tuition fees are, outstanding young people can be prevented from dropping out of school due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>Fourth, we believe that China is a poor country, and it is in a very poor period. In order to save the education crisis, we must quickly consider changing the education system, and in particular, we should adopt entrance examinations for schools at all levels that rely solely on the knowledge and skills of the candidates, and not on school diplomas. At the same time, we should encourage the establishment of various cram schools, public libraries, laboratories, sports grounds, and various broadcast schools, and promote electrical education as much as possible, in order to open up a convenient avenue for self-study for those who cannot afford tuition fees but are truly eager to learn. Only in this way can we see many outstanding poor students be able to seek their knowledge, train their bodies, and have the same academic abilities as those who attend classes in regular schools, whether at home, by the radio, in the library, in the laboratory, or on the sports field. Since the recruitment of new students by schools at all levels is based on academic ability, they will naturally be able to select real talents, which will not hinder the progress of education. Perhaps only by promoting such methods can we rescue a large number of out-of-school youth!</p>

<h3>Sleeping Sickness Found in Tianjin; Four Deaths Already</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] Qu Hongjun, director of the Tianjin Infectious Diseases Hospital, said that several patients with "sleeping sickness" have recently been discovered in Tianjin. Among them, four people have died. Qu said that sleeping sickness is encephalitis, and some patients do not have sleeping phenomena. In the past, it was believed that the transmission of this disease was due to breathing, but it has recently been discovered that mosquitoes are the main vector of transmission. However, it cannot be proven that breathing does not transmit the disease. This disease has two types, A and B. Type B is prevalent in Japan and the United States. According to clinical tests, most of the cases in China belong to Type B of Japan. According to the research of Yan Chunhui, professor of bacteriology at Peking Union Medical College, this disease was not found in China before Japan's large-scale invasion of China on July 7th.

<h3>Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou Writes Article to Encourage All Soldiers to Risk Their Lives to Complete the Victory in Suppressing the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] For the "August 14th" Air Force Day, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou specially wrote an article entitled "Air Force Commemorated on August 14th" to commemorate the occasion and encourage all Air Force soldiers. After analyzing the current situation in more than 2,000 words, the conclusion stated: The military campaign to suppress the rebellion will surely be victorious. Of course, from now until the day the Communist bandits are wiped out, there is still a difficult journey ahead. The ancients said, "He who walks a hundred li is halfway at ninety," which means that the closer one gets to the goal, the more difficult it becomes. Therefore, the Air Force's mission in the future will become more important and more arduous. In order to accomplish this mission, we would like to put forward three simple points to encourage all our compatriots: First, Air Force soldiers not only have advanced technical training, but also have great ambitions and a sincere desire to serve the country, serve the leader, and seek the glorious survival of the Chinese nation. Therefore, we must have the determination to risk our lives and achieve this mission of suppressing the rebellion. Second, mutual love and sincerity are the school motto of everyone's training period, and it is also the motto for the comrades of our army to get along with each other. In the difficult environment in the future, we must love each other more, unite without gaps, and make the entire Air Force a strong body that advances without retreat, wins without defeat, and exerts maximum combat power. Third, even though we are at war, we should continue to make progress in order to lay the foundation for future military building. Training cannot be stopped for a day, and other departments such as manufacturing, repair, supply, and all departments must also have long-term plans.</p>

<h3>One of Our Customs Patrol Boats: British Captain Embezzles and Flees; Six Sailors Under Close Surveillance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th] The truth behind the embezzlement case of the British captain of one of our country's patrol boats has now come to light. The British captain may be extradited to our side to stand trial, as the crime occurred within our country's territorial waters. According to reports, the captain, named Sailteville, was leading six Chinese sailors on patrol near Da Chan Island. At the end of last month, when the boat returned to port to replenish supplies, it encountered a civilian boat carrying contraband. The captain not only failed to detain the boat and hand it over to customs authorities, but also demanded a bribe of 4,000 Hong Kong dollars. When the civilian boat stated that it did not have that much money, Sailteville detained two people as hostages. Later, he released the civilian boat, stipulating that the two hostages would pay the full amount of the bribe upon arrival in port. As the patrol boat approached Qingshan, one of the hostages suddenly broke free and went ashore, reporting to the police. Upon hearing this, Sailteville released the other hostage en route.

<h3>More Than Two Hundred Students From Shanxi Arrive in Beiping; Suddenly Occupy Yingtai and Qin Zheng Dian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] More than two hundred students from Shanxi University who came to Beiping suddenly moved into Yingtai and Qin Zheng Dian in Zhongnanhai on the 12th. At 3:00 PM on the 12th, they drove four trucks loaded with luggage straight inside. Male students occupied Yingtai, and female students occupied Qin Zheng Dian. Although the Suppression Headquarters and the responsible persons for culture and education in the municipal government persuaded them to move out late at night, it was ineffective. The students said that if they were to move out, they needed another proper place to live. Today, the police chief went to persuade them, but they still had not moved out by the evening. They originally lived in Yan Xishan's mansion and had told reporters that the authorities were indifferent to them. Zhongnanhai was scheduled to open on the 15th, and various parts of the Pacification Headquarters had not yet finished closing. Qin Zheng Dian was originally planned to be converted into a guest house, and it had been decided that no part would be allowed to live in the buildings in the park again.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Chen Xueping, acting on orders from the highest authorities, quietly flew from Nanjing to Beiping on the 12th, carrying concrete measures from the central government to resolve the 7/5 Incident and seeking the opinions of Fu Zuoyi, Hu Shi, and others. After getting off the plane, he separately visited Fu Zuoyi, Chen Jicheng, and Hu Shi. This morning, he visited Fu again for a long talk and contacted Qin Decun, Gu Fengxiang, and others. Chen's actions were confidential, and few outside know his residence. It is said that the measures contain three points, but the details are not known. However, according to well-informed sources, a certain garrison authority that the people of the Northeast are demanding to be replaced may receive a demerit. The commander at the scene also bears no great responsibility. It is said that the Beiping Senate authorities also bear no responsibility in the 7/5 investigation report. However, the impassioned emotions of the people of the Northeast must be satisfied to a considerable extent. Chen will return to Nanjing with Qin Decun in a day or two so that the handling orders can be issued before August 19.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi visited Vice Minister Qin Decun at ten o'clock on the morning of the 13th for a long talk.

In addition, the investigation work of Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenyun has also come to an end. Committee member Hu will return to Nanjing in a day or two. Gu will have to stay a little longer to deal with the closing of the Supervisory Commissioner's Office in the Northeast.</p>

(2) Before the pricing formula is revised, the 1st and 16th of each month will be the adjustment dates for the time being. For public utilities, etc., whose prices must be adjusted once a month, quotas can be pre-purchased in the form of fixed coal. (3) When transportation is obstructed or the transport volume is insufficient, each mine shall be responsible for adjustment and give priority to public utilities and railways. (4) The coal produced should be fully transported out as much as possible, and the remaining balance should be gradually stored in important areas to the specified storage amount before the allocation quota can be expanded. (5) The new organization should be jointly formed by various mines in the same industry under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Resources Committee, and the government should still organize it during the transition period.</p>

<h3>Results of Several Meetings at the Kremlin: The Berlin Stalemate Has Not Been Resolved; Soviet Military Police Once Invaded British and American Occupation Zones</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 12th] The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France talked with Molotov about the German issue for three hours tonight. The members are looking for a plan to reconcile the different opinions between the East and West on the German issue. US Ambassador Smith said, "We had a very pleasant talk." However, out of respect for the decision to maintain confidentiality, he refused to comment. After the meeting, the three special envoys gathered at the French ambassador's residence to jointly draft a report to their respective governments.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] It is widely rumored that the talks in Moscow are unlikely to be fruitful, but political and diplomatic circles here have not confirmed this pessimistic news, and said that the talks are still in progress, so there is no reason to relax the hope of achieving good results. The authorities are still strictly keeping secrets about the situation in Moscow and refusing to comment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th, United Press] Soviet military police, in collusion with German police in Germany, invaded the British and American zones of Berlin today under the pretext of searching for black market dealers. A rapid response team of Soviet military police and German police working for the Soviet Union broke into apartments in the British and American zones. The German police in the Western zone immediately telegraphed the British and American military police to come and assist in stopping them. At that time, the leader of a British patrol team led the team to come, and the team leader asked the Soviet soldiers to withdraw from the British and American zones, which the Soviet side accepted. By the time an American army team arrived, the Soviet soldiers had already left.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th] A spokesman for the US military government said in a radio address today, "The current confidentiality of the Moscow talks does not mean that the great powers will resume secret diplomacy in the future. US Ambassador Smith at the Moscow talks has 140 million Americans behind him." He cited the results of a public opinion poll in the United States, saying that 80 percent of the American people believe that Western countries should stay in Berlin, even at the cost of war.</p>
<p>He also recalled the letters from President Roosevelt to Hitler in 1938 and 1939, which were regarded by Hitler as a sign of weakness," but "the tens of thousands of tanks, tens of thousands of airplanes, and atomic bombs produced by the United States every year have shown Hitler's miscalculations. The experience of history since 1938 has opened the eyes of the American people." He concluded, "The United States is now rushing to build airplanes that can be used by 70 air force teams, but every American hopes that these modern airplanes will not have to be used in the end."</p>

<h3>Mrs. Kasenkina Seriously Injured After Jumping From a Building</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 12th] Mrs. Kasenkina, a Soviet elementary school teacher, fell from a fourth-floor window of the Soviet Consulate here a few minutes after hearing a radio broadcast saying that the Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, had refused to hand her over to the court to explain whether she had been forcibly detained. Mrs. Kasenkina has now been sent to Roosevelt Hospital. According to the nurse, Mrs. Kasenkina has a fractured right leg and internal injuries, and her condition is critical. Deputy Police Commissioner Lawson Gast said that he had interrogated consulate staff for a long time but could not determine whether Mrs. Kasenkina had fallen or jumped. Lawson also said that he was investigating the possibility that Mrs. Kasenkina might have been pushed. Soviet personnel said that Mrs. Kasenkina was extremely annoyed by the remarks in the broadcast.

The doctor immediately waved to stop Mullins from asking questions and to ask again when she was stronger.</p>
<h3>Mrs. K. Compares Herself to a Bird; Wants to Break Out of the Cage</h3>

She said, "I'm afraid of them. I don't want to see anyone from the Soviet consulate." Mrs. Kasenkina told Deputy Detective Mullins, "I'm afraid to see them. I'm afraid of them, so I don't want to see them." But Soviet Deputy Consul General Ghibonik, after being turned away by the police three times, still said that he would continue to try until he was allowed to meet with her. Mrs. Kasenkina is now quietly resting in Roosevelt Hospital, under heavy police protection, to prevent any attempts that may endanger her life. Her condition is said to be "dangerous but not fatal." Belyakov, a White Russian who helped Mrs. Kasenkina escape to the Tolstoy Foundation, visited her in the hospital. According to him, Mrs. Kasenkina told him, "I'm like a bird in a cage. I must fly out. I must try to break out of the cage."</p>

<h3>Truman Deeply Dissatisfied With Lack of Accomplishments From Special Session of Congress; Republicans Cannot Escape Blame for Rising Prices</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman today slammed the 80th Congress as a do-nothing Congress.

<h3>US Suggests Expanding the Danube Committee; Soviet Bloc Expresses Opposition; Vyshinsky Vigorously Criticizes the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 12th] Western countries tried on the 12th to overturn the Soviet plan to restrict the new Danube River Committee to the Soviet Union and its six riparian states, but it was clearly just another ineffective gesture. The United States suggested expanding the committee to include the United States, Britain, France, and Austria. Germany can also participate after the peace treaty is signed. The vice chairman of the US delegation also stated that if Austria and Germany become members of the committee, there will be appropriate provisions for the representation of countries that do not participate in the committee, and the United States is willing to give up its membership. The representatives of South Korea condemned Britain and the United States for attempting to invade the Danube River region with economic power.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 12th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky today criticized the Western countries' policy towards the Danube River and opposed the US proposal for Germany to participate in the Danube River Committee, strongly arguing that Germany's participation can only be decided by the Foreign Ministers' Conference in accordance with the Potsdam Resolution. He pointed out that Austria's participation can be accepted after the Austrian peace treaty is signed. Vyshinsky also replied to the British representative's question, saying that not only is Ukraine a Danube River country, but a small part of the Soviet Union's territory is also on the Danube River. However, no matter how you look at any map, you will not find that British land is connected to the Danube River. He also took the opportunity to attack the Marshall Plan as "American economic dictatorship."</p>

<h3>US Recognizes New Korean Government – Full Text of Announcement</h3>
<p>[From the US News Agency, Washington, 12th] The full text of the United States' provisional recognition of the new Korean government is as follows: "In the joint declaration issued in Cairo on December 1, 1943, the signatory nations, namely the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, expressed their determination that 'in due course Korea shall become free and independent.' This determination was reaffirmed in the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, which the Soviet Union also joined after declaring war on Japan on August 8 of the same year. On December 27, 1945, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom signed an agreement stipulating the reconstruction of Korea as an independent state, which the Chinese government subsequently joined and pledged to uphold. Although Japan's annexation of Korea was completely terminated by the occupation of the country by the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States in August and September 1945, the freedom and independence of Korea, solemnly guaranteed by the four powers, has proven to be very slow in realization. After nearly two years of arduous efforts by the United States government to implement these guarantees through negotiations with other occupying powers proved futile, the Korean independence issue was brought before the United Nations General Assembly on September 17, 1947. The will of the vast majority of countries in the General Assembly was expressed in two resolutions adopted on November 14, 1947, the purpose of which was to make possible the long-sought freedom and independence of the Korean people through the holding of free elections and the establishment of a national government. To implement these resolutions, a temporary commission for Korea was established to supervise the election of representatives to a National Assembly, which would then establish a national government. The National Assembly, elected at that time, convened on May 31 and has begun to organize a government. It is also hoped that the people of North Korea, although unable to participate in the elections of May 10 due to the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions in its occupied zone, will eventually be able to assume their rightful place in this government through appropriate processes. Notification of the establishment of the new government was sent to the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea on August 6, 1948. "The US government believes that the new Korean government, produced in this way, should be regarded as the government of Korea as anticipated by the General Assembly resolution of November 14, 1947. Pending the consideration by the General Assembly at its future third session of the report of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, the United States, in accordance with its responsibilities as an occupying power, will appoint a special representative to Seoul to negotiate with the Korean government and the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea regarding the implementation of the provisions of Section 4 of the Second Resolution of November 14, 1947. The President has appointed Mr. Macano of Rhode Island as the aforementioned special representative, who will hold the rank of ambassador."</p>

<h3>Stalin's Successor: Still the Biggest Secret</h3>
<p>— By Middleton</p>
<p>The fact that Joseph Stalin, the son of a cobbler from Gori, is 68 years old this year is the most important political fact in the Soviet Union. Every year, during his long vacations in Sochi on the Black Sea, rumors of the leader's cancer always resurface, and the succession issue becomes more serious month by month. The most powerful ruler in the world is the head of this totalitarian state. The overall political system he prides himself on is top-down. The succession issue may cause the unity to break.</p>
<p>Moscow believes that Stalin has prepared a successor. This is a secret within a secret in this secretive country. Because if the name of the successor is made public, it may develop into a split in the government. Either a split between Stalin and the successor, weakening the former's power, or a conflict between Stalin and his successor and others who have the right to obtain this position.</p>
<p>The test of the highest power in the Soviet state depends on whether the ruthless, capable, and intelligent figures under Stalin who are qualified to succeed can obey his choice after Stalin's death. Historical precedents show that designating a successor is often the most powerful means of inciting power struggles.</p>
<p>Four Successors</p>
<p>There are four people who are the most suitable successors. The most well-known is Molotov, who has been the Minister of Foreign Affairs since 1939 to the present, and is 57 years old this year. He served as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars for eleven years. In the future struggle for the leadership succession, Molotov is the representative of the government. He is the manager of the government and bureaucracy. He is more prominent in the Politburo than any other figure. He knows how to operate the intricate machine of bureaucratic and governmental agencies. This is very important in a country that lacks technical and defense personnel in government and industry.</p>
<p>Molotov has two other advantages. He is more experienced than any other top government figure. He cooperated with Lenin and Stalin during the 1917 revolution, which is of great historical significance.</p>
<p>Zhdanov has the image of a rising sun. He is in charge of the organizational work of the Comintern, responsible for issuing communist theory and directives for the activities of foreign parties, is 51 years old this year, and is a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party and a member of the Politburo.</p>
<p>Zhdanov's strength reflects the strength of the Party. The military weakened the Party's position during the war. Since the end of the war, the Communist Party's membership has increased to five million, regaining its former advantage.</p>
<p>Beria is a lesser-known figure around Stalin. He and Stalin are both Georgians, and he is 48 years old this year. His possible attainment of the position of successor is due to his scholarship and his knowledge of the security apparatus. He was recently nominated as Deputy Minister of State Security. As early as 1946, Beria left this position to engage in "special work." All of this has not been confirmed, but it is believed that Beria is responsible for organizing military and industrial research into atomic fission.</p>
<p>Beria is the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Generally speaking, this position gives him the power to manage two or three important ministries. However, in his current position, his receipt of this title may give him the right to control all ministries closely related to his work.</p>
<p>Marshal Bulganin has become the most promising successor since the end of the war. His appointment as Minister of the Army indicates that the Party's strength has surpassed the position of the military figures who gained dominance during the war. Marshal Bulganin, an alternate member of the Politburo, is the military's representative in the Bureau. His military department has no regular troops. He is not a military leader who rose from the Party to exclude dissidents. During the war, he held an important position in the cooperation of heavy industry, and before the war, he was the President of the National Bank.</p>
<p>In addition to these four, there are two others who, even if they do not have the qualifications to succeed, at least have friendship and contact with the leader.</p>
<p>One is Malenkov, a member of the Politburo who assists Zhdanov in organizing the Communist Party. The other is Kaganovich, who is responsible for major post-war work and recently engaged in the cleansing work in Ukraine.

<h3>The Rich Are Panicked, Voluntarily Seeking Meetings with the Mayor – One Name May Be Announced the Day After Tomorrow – Only Over One Trillion Yuan in Cash Received to Date</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, a group of reporters from this city collectively visited Mayor Wu at his office to inquire about the progress of the special relief donation. Because the special donation has so far remained in the "only hear the sound of weaving upstairs" stage, the fundraising committee has repeatedly stated that it will publish the list of stingy wealthy individuals, but there has been no concrete indication of a "showdown." The reporters specifically asked Mayor Wu to reveal some information. According to the mayor, the name of one very wealthy person may be announced next Monday (the 16th). When reporters asked which industry the wealthy tycoon belonged to, he was temporarily unwilling to disclose it, only saying that the wealthy class in this city is now quite panicked, and a considerable number of people have been voluntarily seeking meetings with the mayor in recent days. He also stated that after the name of a certain wealthy person is announced, it will definitely have the effect of "killing one to warn a hundred," and he is convinced that the unfolding of fundraising work in the future will be more convenient.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter asked whether all the wealthy people in this city were included in the city government's fundraising net. He replied: All wealthy people related to politics are not within the scope of the local area and are stipulated to be responsible for fundraising by the central government. In addition, Mayor Wu declared that the total amount of funds raised announced by the special relief donation fundraising committee, over four trillion yuan, includes US dollar bonds and garden houses and other real estate. In fact, the committee has only received one trillion yuan in cash, of which nine hundred billion yuan has been deposited into the Bank of Shanghai to purchase treasury bills, and the remaining amount is deposited in other banks, with the principal and interest used for the local organization of a garrison brigade. As for houses and bonds, etc., they will be publicly auctioned off on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>After the Implementation of Total War, the Jurisdiction of the Garrison Command Will Expand</h3>
<p>The Garrison Brigade Can Be Established in Early October</p>
<p>Garrison Commander Xuan Tie Wu told reporters on the 13th that the rumors about the expansion of the jurisdiction and organization of the Songhu Garrison Command and personnel changes will depend on whether Songhu implements total war early. He had provided the authorities with opinions on implementing total war early. The relevant departments of the Ministry of National Defense once convened relevant agencies to discuss this, but this matter is of great importance and involves legislative issues, so it may take some time. As for the preparation work of the garrison brigade, it is now being accelerated. The selection of the brigade commander is pending approval from the Ministry of National Defense. In his ideal, this person should have considerable qualifications and prestige in the domestic military circle. According to reporters, the brigade is expected to be established in early October. Whether the inspection department of the garrison command will be directly under the Ministry of National Defense also awaits instructions from the authorities.</p>

<h3>A Batch of Nylon Stockings: Sealing and Storage Raises Questions – Yue Gu Bo Factory Claims They Are Domestically Produced – The Social Affairs Bureau Finds Handling Difficult</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the ban on the sale of nylon stockings, the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Police Bureau, seized 15 dozen and four pairs of men's nylon stockings and 13 pairs of women's nylon stockings from Dahua Department Store on Linsen Middle Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau suddenly received a report from the Yue Gu Bo Machine Factory at 3 Caojiazhai, Jiangsu Road, claiming that the stockings were produced by the factory. The factory had been approved by the former Ministry of Economic Affairs and issued factory registration certificate No. 12160. The customs also allowed the nylon stockings to be exported to earn foreign exchange. Although the raw materials for the nylon stockings came from the United States, the weaving was purely domestic. The factory currently has more than 200 workers. If the sale is prohibited, the factory will inevitably shut down, the workers will be laid off, and the impact will be very significant. After receiving this information, the Social Affairs Bureau felt it was difficult to handle, because the stockings were indeed domestically produced and registered with the former Ministry of Economic Affairs, but if they were returned, it would fear obstructing the ban. Therefore, the disposal method is still under consideration.</p>

<h3>Disputes in the Trucking Industry Resolved – Written Record Signed</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Orders Chen Fuju to Resume Work First</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Trucking workers in this city requested an adjustment to their treatment. After the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for negotiations, a written record was signed: (1) Both parties agreed on the method of paying wages. The increase or decrease in the original wage and vehicle towing force is calculated based on the fare, but the percentage of increase or decrease in the original wage and vehicle towing force is calculated at 80% of the percentage of increase or decrease in the fare. This is now changed to 100%. (2) Because the management of each industry sympathized with the workers' inherently low salaries, each industry made a one-time general increase. Niu Bingji's original wage of 4.8 million yuan was increased to 5.2 million yuan. Yin Fuju's original wage of 4.25 million yuan was increased to 4.5 million yuan, and the original 4.95 million yuan was increased to 5.2 million yuan.

<h3>The Mayor Worries About the Public Utilities Impasse – Decides to Recommend to the City Council to Organize an Investigation and Deliberation Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the City Council's opposition to the price increase of public utilities, the City Government has decided to recommend that the City Council organize a Public Utilities Investigation and Deliberation Committee at the special meeting convened today to publicly investigate the accounts and business conditions of various companies. The committee hopes to be established on the 16th and completed by the end of this month. The case is scheduled to be implemented after being submitted to the City Council for approval today.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu met with reporters at the city government office at 5:00 PM yesterday and said that the public utilities price issue in August has fallen into an impasse. He had long anticipated that the price of public utilities would become a municipal problem. Mayor Wu specially showed the original texts of his letters of resignation to the Executive Yuan and the President on June 8th and June 29th. He said that the motive for resigning on June 8th was purely because prices could not be controlled and it was expected that public utilities would face the biggest crisis. The main factors for resigning on the 29th were rice allocation and refugee problems. Mayor Wu expressed great concern about how to break the current public utilities impasse. He believes that the price of public utilities can be reduced, but there must be reasonable conditions. If prices are reduced reluctantly before there is a remedy, the price increase in September will inevitably be even higher.</p>
<h3>A Misunderstanding on the Bus Caused a Conflict – Trolley Cars Halted for Two Hours – A Fierce Battle on the Bund Ended with an Apology</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon on Nanjing Road, a conflict occurred again between soldiers and trolley car drivers and conductors. Trolley cars on various lines of the British-owned routes 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 11 were suspended from 12:05 PM to 2:18 PM, a total of 2 hours and 13 minutes. The following is a record of what happened:</p>
<p>At 12:00 noon yesterday, the British-owned Route 1 trolley car No. 42 broke down after arriving at the Bund on Beijing Road and could not move. Just then, a Route 8 trolley car arrived and pushed the car to the Bund on Nanjing Road, tying it to the back of a Route 2 trolley car with an iron cable, intending to tow it back to the Hart Road factory for repairs. Just as they were about to start the car, a dozen or so people in military uniforms suddenly came and insisted on taking this damaged trolley car. The driver and conductor on the car told them that the car was going to the factory for repairs and would no longer take passengers, and asked them to take another car. Unexpectedly, this caused a misunderstanding and even led to mutual fighting. According to eyewitnesses, there were already three or five soldiers on the car at the time, arguing loudly with the driver and conductor in the car. One of the soldiers suddenly grabbed the fat driver's chest and pushed him hard, hitting the entrance door of the first-class carriage, and the glass shattered with a bang. The driver grabbed the man and refused to let go. When the other soldiers saw that an accident had occurred, they wanted to escape, so they stepped forward to push the driver away and got out of the car together, heading towards Renji Road. The conductor and driver shouted for help. At this time, more and more trolley car personnel gathered, the momentum was strong, and they shouted and swarmed along Renji Road in pursuit. One of the conductors took out his police whistle and blew it wildly to cheer them on. After a while, surrounded by dozens of trolley car workers, they twisted back one of the soldiers and locked him in the car. Some people shouted to beat him, and others shouted to stop them. While they were arguing, the rest of the soldiers suddenly rushed back to rescue the imprisoned soldier, which caused another battle. At that time, many passing soldiers also joined the fight. For a time, traffic in front of the Sassoon House was cut off. The "melee" lasted for about five minutes and then stopped automatically. Except for the ticket seller of No. 672, whose left eye was injured and bleeding, there were no other injuries. At that time, the police station had received the news and sent police cars, "Shanghai Security Guard" and other vehicles to the scene, and took the trolley car workers and the soldiers who caused the trouble back to the Huangpu Police Station. After questioning, it was learned that the group of people in military uniforms were students from a certain school and had military status, so they were transferred to the Penglai Road Military Police Headquarters. The group of military students, realizing they were at fault, apologized to the trolley car workers. The workers also felt that only one person was slightly injured and did not want to cause more trouble, and the dispute was resolved.</p>

<h3>Superintendent of Reformatory Accused: Decision Not to Prosecute</h3>
<p>Two Laborers Charged with Illegal Detention</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational case of the murder of a foster daughter at the Women's Reformatory has been concluded after investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. The Superintendent of the Reformatory, Sha Sailan, and the Section Chief, Yang Jiayuan, have been ruled not to be prosecuted. It originated when a woman from Liyang, Huang Wangshi, came to Shanghai last December to work as a domestic helper. After being dismissed, she got lost and was taken in by the Women's Relief Center. Later, Huang Wangshi, suffering from homesickness due to illness, colluded with another resident, Feng Wenmei, to secretly escape on the morning of May 11th at 2 AM. They were discovered and apprehended by two laborers from the reformatory, Shen Xinfa and Sang Liqi. On June 23rd at 3 PM, Huang Wangshi suddenly died of illness. The reformatory notified Pushan Villa to collect and bury the body. Neighboring residents, including Lu Shutian, heard that Huang Wangshi had died from being beaten and suffering a miscarriage. They filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Superintendent Sha Sailan and Section Chief Yang Jiayuan of homicide. After repeated investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office and an autopsy by the forensic doctor, which found that "there were no fractures or breaks in any of the bones" of the deceased, a decision was made not to prosecute. However, because the two laborers, Shen and Sang, used ropes to tie up Huang Wangshi and Feng Wenmei when they were apprehended, the District Prosecutor's Office has separately prosecuted them for illegal detention.</p>

Zhanghua complained that the quality was not good and later returned 200,000 pounds. The second allocation was in October of the same year, and Zhanghua voluntarily gave up. The third allocation was between December of the following year and February, when Zhanghua and Anle jointly received 120,000 pounds of greasy wool and 200,000 pounds of scoured wool. The fourth allocation was not carried out due to differences in the price difference, and no company received any. Jiang Renlin stated regarding the accusation of embezzling 178,080 yuan of reserve funds: The staff member Chen Tingchang paid for tea leaves, candles, and soap out of pocket, but the reimbursement was not approved, and Chen has not returned the money. Chen has now moved and his whereabouts are unknown. He also presented a letter of certification from the neighborhood chief in court. After the respondents and witnesses testified about the wool allocation figures, arguments began. The court decided to announce the verdict on the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>Murdering a Dance Hostess for Money: Wuxi Tragedy Solved; Key Suspect Zhu Jingqing Arrested in Qin; Jumped from Train During Escort to Wuxi, Severely Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Meiyu (24 years old), a dance hostess from the Hao You Navigator Agency at No. 4 Youhui Lane, Wanqian Road, Wuxi, went to the suburbs with two regular customers, Zhu Jingqing and Zhang Renzhong, on the 7th. Meiyu did not return that day. The next morning, a child collecting firewood climbed the summit of Ermao Peak (also known as Qingshan Bay) in Huishan and discovered the body of a woman dressed in luxurious clothing. There was a pair of trousers tied tightly around her neck, and there was a knife wound on her face. Later, the local township head of Huishan Town reported this to the local County Police Bureau, which sent police to investigate and reported this to the District Prosecutor's Office for inspection. The news spread, and the Hao You Navigator Agency also learned of it. They suspected something was wrong because Meiyu had not returned, so her husband went to identify the body, which was confirmed to be his wife. After the County Police Bureau investigated in all directions, they determined that Zhu Jingqing and Zhang Renzhong were the prime suspects. According to her husband, Meiyu had been wearing a pair of gold bracelets on her wrists, a pair of gold anklets on her feet, as well as a gold necklace, a gold locket, and a gold ring, totaling over three taels, all of which had been stolen. Therefore, it was determined to be a murder for money. After several days of investigation, it was learned that Zhu Jingqing was from Wuxi, 23 years old, and had been a guerrilla. He was originally a rogue. Last year, he worked as a worker at the Da An Rubber Factory on Huaide Road in Eastern Shanghai. Zhang Renzhong was from Jiangwan and worked with Zhu at the same factory. Zhu lived in a wooden house across from Huishan Lane on Qiqihar Road in Shanghai, and it was learned that the suspect had returned to Shanghai. On the night of the 11th, the Wuxi County Police Bureau prepared official documents and sent Criminal Police officers Huang Peng and Zhu Xin to Shanghai by train. After contacting the local police authorities, police were dispatched to assist. At 6:30 AM on the 12th, they rushed to the wooden house on Qiqihar Road and successfully arrested Zhu. He was temporarily detained at the Yulin Road Precinct. According to Zhu, he went from Shanghai to Wuxi on the 5th and stayed at No. 18 Dalu Hotel, then moved to No. 27 Yong'an Hotel. He returned to Shanghai at 4 PM on the 8th and vehemently denied being involved in Meiyu's murder. The suspect was escorted back to Wuxi by officers from the Wuxi County Police Bureau at 4:30 PM that afternoon to be investigated. Zhang Renzhong is still being pursued.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 13th] Zhu Jingqing, the prime suspect in the Huishan murder case, was arrested in Shanghai yesterday. At 7 PM on the 12th, criminal police escorted him back to Wuxi. When the train passed Waitang, Zhu jumped from the train to escape, fearing punishment. He was arrested a second time in Qiujia Village near Weishi. Because he was severely injured, he has been sent to the hospital for treatment by the police before being interrogated again.</p>

<h3>Telecommunications and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Diao Zhibing</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Living in this modern era, people are moving forward with the wheels of time, and the relationships between people are becoming increasingly complex and close. The need for communication and contact is also increasing day by day. Therefore, post and telecommunications have become emerging public utilities today. However, due to the accumulated habits left over from history, there is not only no affection between the government and the people, but also a lack of cooperation, which affects the progress of work and fails to achieve the expected results. Leaving aside large-scale political facilities, let's focus on the telecommunications sector. If you hope that your telegram can be delivered to the other party quickly and properly, or if you hope that your phone will connect as soon as you call, then the "Telegraph Accuracy and Telephone Time-Saving Campaign" recently launched by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau is a very effective method. However, despite repeated publicity by the Telecommunications Bureau, too few people understand and implement it, which cannot be said to be a regrettable shortcoming in the future development of telephone services.</p>
<p>A few months ago, telecommunications and postage stamp exhibitions appeared in Shanghai, attracting widespread attention and interest. The reporter will first discuss the relationship between telecommunications and transportation here, and the postal service will be discussed in a separate article later.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>For a country like ours to progress from being backward to modern, we must engage in external development. The issue of transportation construction should be a primary aspect of all development. Transportation includes both spiritual and material aspects, namely, communication and transportation. Transportation is to a country as nerves and blood vessels are to the human body. Railways, highways, aviation, and navigation are the blood vessels, while telecommunications and postal services are the nerves. We have not seen a person with an unsound nervous system and blood vessel organization who can be healthy, just as we cannot find in the world a country with underdeveloped transportation that can be rich and strong. Building railways, highways, developing aviation, and opening up navigation are certainly active transportation construction, but they are ultimately insufficient to make the entire transportation system flexible and sound. Moreover, if this type of transportation is not coordinated with the development of communication, it will not be able to complete quickly and will lose its transportation effectiveness.</p>
<p>For example, the construction of a railway or highway requires the prior laying of telecommunications to connect various large and complex projects such as surveying routes, building bridges, constructing earthworks, laying sleepers, and hanging rails. Even after completion, issues such as traffic safety, vehicle dispatching, and all temporary emergency measures require telecommunications to transmit information. As for the operation of airplanes and ships in the air and at sea, they almost entirely rely on telecommunications to report weather conditions, guide directions, land, or approach the shore. Otherwise, there would be few that could operate freely as usual. Understanding this, we can see that the better and more complete the telecommunications equipment, the safer and faster various transportation modes will be. Therefore, telecommunications is not only an important means of transportation in itself but also the transportation of transportation.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Therefore, in modern times, communication, post, and telecommunications have become essential tools, and telecommunications transmission is particularly fast. Whether it is text or language, it can be transmitted from the ends of the earth to the corners of the sea instantly by means of electrical energy. It breaks the limitations of time and space, shrinks the scope of the world, and gives people a sense of "the world is like a neighborhood."</p>
<p>In the United States, last year, General Motors conducted a trial run of wireless telephone communication between the "Train of Tomorrow" traveling across the Midwest to Chicago and the "Queen Elizabeth" ocean liner sailing to London on the Atlantic Ocean. The voice originated from the train, traveled to Calumet City, then via landline to WGN radio station in Chicago, and then to the Queen Elizabeth liner traveling on the Atlantic Ocean 1,800 miles away. Passengers on the train and passengers on the ship spoke for 37 minutes with clear sound, achieving extraordinary success. Recently, many trains in the United States have wireless telephone equipment, providing passengers with great convenience in transportation.</p>
<p>Telecommunications technology is changing rapidly. The United States has recently invented a high-speed facsimile telegraph machine. This machine uses a high-speed telephoto method, using inertialess cathode rays, combined with rapidly moving photographic film, to transmit one million words per minute. In addition, the "SOJ Twelve-Channel Carrier Telephone" produced by the "Standard Telephone and Cables Company" in London, England, allows thirty-two people to speak simultaneously or three hundred and eighty-six people to send telegrams simultaneously on a pair of lines without interfering with each other. These achievements not only save material resources but also increase speed and reduce wasted time. Its contribution to transportation and all undertakings is self-evident.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>According to statistics from last year, there are approximately 51 million telephones worldwide. The United States accounts for 27 million, averaging one telephone for every five people. The United Kingdom has 3.9 million, one for every twelve people. France has 1.8 million, one for every twenty people. China has 160,000, one for every three thousand people. The telephone lines in the United States are 178 million kilometers long, and the telegraph lines are 3.6 million kilometers long. The telegraph and telephone lines in China are each approximately 100,000 kilometers long. Americans send an average of two telegrams per year, while in China, only one telegram is sent per thirty-three people per year.</p>
<p>From the above figures, we can see that the wealth and strength of a country must rely on the development of transportation, and the development of transportation must rely on telecommunications as a pioneer. China's telecommunications and transportation have suffered from the division by warlords and the devastation of the Anti-Japanese War. It was already deficient from birth, and later lost its conditioning. In addition, today's politics cannot be stable, the economy cannot prosper, equipment relies on foreign countries, and frequent civil wars cause destruction. Apart from a few large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, which have made some achievements, the areas close to the war zones are full of scars and fragmented. Recovery is already difficult, let alone development.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>If China does not want to be among the ranks of strong nations, then so be it. Otherwise, we should raise our vigilance, face reality, and face transportation. Emphasize the importance of telecommunications and transportation, and then build and develop the telecommunications industry, establish a close national communication network, and firmly shoulder the important tasks and missions assigned to telecommunications by the times.</p>
<h3>Telegram Long-Distance Telephone</h3>
<p>— Zhu Rong</p>
<p>The general public is obviously accustomed to using long-distance telephones, but seems unfamiliar with the newer service of "telegram long-distance telephone." In certain situations, those who understand the method of telegram transmission can take advantage. Here, I would like to briefly introduce it.</p>
<p>When making a long-distance telephone call, the address of the receiving party is often far from the place of the call, requiring the telecommunications bureau to send someone directly to notify them (that is, to call someone to speak). It takes a lot of time to run to the place to answer the call after being notified, and sometimes the caller is busy with business and cannot wait for a reply from the other party, and there is no one to replace the caller. Therefore, this telegram telephone can be used to entrust the telecommunications bureau to be responsible for conveying what you want to say. Although you cannot directly talk to each other, its effect may sometimes be clearer and more understandable than talking directly.</p>
<p>Moreover, the procedure for sending and receiving telegram telephone calls is very simple. When the caller registers with the long-distance operator by telephone, first declare that it is a "telegram telephone" for the purpose of distinguishing it, and then report the "caller's name," "caller's telephone number," "receiver's address," "receiver's telephone number," "receiver's name," and a concise "content to be conveyed." The long-distance operator's recorder will immediately write it down and repeat it again. This can avoid errors. If the caller goes directly to the business office of the telecommunications bureau to register, it is even more convenient. In addition to filling in the name, address, and telephone number of yourself and the other party, you can also fill in the content to be conveyed in simple words and clear sentences on the registration form. The text should not be too long, preferably not exceeding thirty words.</p>
<p>This method is only applicable to "urgent call notification," and the call fee is charged at the rate of an urgent call notification. The telecommunications bureau can be responsible for conveying it to the other party within two hours. As for canceling the call and refunding the fee, it is handled in the same way as an urgent call notification.</p>
<h3>Why Can't the Telephone Connect?</h3>
<p>— Ji Er</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>I recently visited a factory run by an old classmate. The factory has a telephone under the jurisdiction of the Telecommunications Bureau (commonly known as the (O2) telephone). Because I work at the Telecommunications Bureau, he asked me, "Why can't this telephone often connect?" I asked him what number he was dialing, picked up the receiver, and dialed for him, and it connected smoothly.</p>
<p>Huh! Is there a distinction between "insiders" and "outsiders" when making a phone call? It's hard to say.</p>
<p>I asked that classmate again what numbers he was trying to dial when he said it often wouldn't connect. After listening to him, it turned out that they were all telephones within the area of the Shanghai Telephone Company. I also asked him how he usually dialed (that is, how he dialed the desired number). Only then did I realize that the reason why his telephone often couldn't connect was mostly because he didn't know how to connect between the Telecommunications Bureau and the Telephone Company, and what dialing method should be used.</p>
<p>Indeed, because all the telephones in Shanghai belong to two major areas, in addition to the inevitable internal and external line obstacles that occur from time to time, the reason why most telephones cannot connect is probably the same as my classmate's, that is, due to not knowing the accurate dialing method. Therefore, it seems necessary to restate the connection between the two and how to dial. (The "Why Can't the Telephone Connect?" discussed in this article focuses specifically on how to dial from a Telecommunications Bureau user to a Telephone Company user. The following will focus on this topic.) Originally, the method for a Telecommunications Bureau user to connect to a Telephone Company user is to dial a "〇" (zero) after hearing a "dial tone," and then wait to hear the second "dial tone" (issued by the Telephone Company, which is the same as the "dial tone" directly heard by the Telephone Company users) before dialing the desired telephone number again.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The lines set up by the Telecommunications Bureau to connect to the Telephone Company for the above-mentioned connection function are 125 pairs at the Hongkou Bureau and 95 pairs at the Nanshi Bureau, called "relay lines." That is, the Hongkou Bureau can only have 125 users simultaneously dialing Telephone Company users, while the Nanshi Bureau can only have 95 users simultaneously dialing Telephone Company users. Therefore, if you occupy a pair of lines, other users have one less opportunity. However, it is usually not very difficult, because the time you occupy a pair of lines to connect and talk is mostly no more than two or three minutes. Even if you wait a little longer to call someone, it is only four or five minutes. Once the call is over, you hang up, and others can use it. Therefore, the number of relay lines mentioned above is sufficient to meet the current number of users. However, if you occupy a pair of lines and fail to use them well, so you cannot connect; because you cannot connect, you still occupy that pair of lines without releasing it, the result is that you still cannot connect, and other people's opportunities are taken up by you.</p>
<p>Now we should talk about why my classmate often couldn't connect. It turns out that although he knew to dial a "〇" (zero) after hearing the first "dial tone," he didn't care whether the second "dial tone" came or not, and went to dial the Telephone Company user number. If the second "dial tone" came after he finished dialing, that would be fine, he might have heard it and redialed; the worst thing is that when he was dialing in the middle (or had already dialed one digit, or two digits, or three digits, or four digits), the second "dial tone" came, but he dialed on his own, so it was as if he had only dialed four digits, or three digits, or two digits, or one digit. This is a problem of not dialing the entire number, so the machine is occupied by him, the phone is not connected, and he is still waiting! (For example, if he wants to dial 12345, he dials "〇" and then dials continuously. After dialing "1," the second "dial tone" comes, the result is that he dials 2345. If he dials another digit at random, for example, 6, then he dials the user at number 23456. And if he doesn't dial any more, then he stops.)</p>
<p>There are also many people who don't dial "〇" first and directly dial the desired number, so either they dial the wrong number or hear a "busy signal" that sounds like a "non-existent number signal."</p>
<p>There are also people who, like my classmate, dial "〇" and then dial continuously. After dialing, the second "dial tone" comes, but he thinks it is the first "dial tone" and redials "〇," and then it doesn't connect again.</p>
<p>There are also those who, after dialing "〇," wait for the second "dial tone" to come, but he puts the receiver aside and does other things; this is a bad method of trying to preemptively occupy the line because sometimes the traffic is busy, so the relay line is not easy to obtain, or the relay line is obtained but the second "dial tone" comes late. In fact, if you don't hear a "busy signal" after dialing "〇," then the second "dial tone" will eventually come, at most in one or two minutes; and now this second "dial tone" only lasts for half a minute. If you don't use it and dial a number within this half minute, then it is gone, but the machine is occupied in vain. So, if the above-mentioned person rests for a while and then picks up the receiver to listen, the second "dial tone" may have already passed, but he thinks it hasn't come yet and still puts the receiver aside and is still waiting. This is terrible, on the one hand, the machine is occupied and other users cannot use it, so the traffic becomes busier, so users want to preemptively occupy the line, and therefore the relay line and the second "dial tone" become more difficult to obtain, and he still complains that the phone cannot connect!</p>
<p>There are also people who, after dialing "〇," do hear a "busy signal" because all the relay lines are temporarily busy and not idle. At this time, they should hang up and redial after a while, but he still dials his number on his own, so there is no hope of connecting either.</p>
<p>The initial "dial tone" is a continuous "buzzing" sound. The sound issued by the Telecommunications Bureau is weaker and more scattered; the sound issued by the Telephone Company, that is, the so-called second "dial tone" heard after dialing "〇," is stronger and more direct. Users may wish to dial and listen when the traffic is quieter in the afternoon or evening, compare them carefully, and then they can distinguish them. After distinguishing them, they can hang up the receiver immediately, which does not count as making a phone call.</p>
<p>The so-called "busy signal," also known as "busy tone," is a "squeak...squeak...squeak..." sound. It indicates that the line is not free or that the telephone of the called user is in use.</p>
<p>The "non-existent number signal" indicates that there is no user with that number. At the Telecommunications Bureau, this sound is similar to the "busy signal"; at the Telephone Company, it is a "di di di di...di di di di di di..." sound.</p>
<p>There is also a "ringback tone," which indicates that the bell of the called user is already ringing. It is a "burr-luk-luk-luk...burr-luk-luk-luk" sound.</p>
<p>Therefore, to ensure that the phone can be connected quickly, in addition to the Telecommunications Bureau and the Telephone Company paying close attention to the internal and external lines, obtaining the cooperation of users and ensuring that everyone can dial accurately is also an important step.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Knowledge Talk (10) (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 6 How to Calculate the Number of Words (Continued)</p>
<p>Here, please first talk about the Chinese clear text telegrams, which account for more than 90% of all telegrams handled by the Telecommunications Bureau. Everyone who has sent telegrams knows that Chinese clear text telegrams are compiled and transmitted using the new telegraph code compiled by the Ministry of Transportation, with each group of four numbers representing a code. After the receiving station receives the telegram, it is translated from the new telegraph code into text and then delivered to the recipient. This method of translating text using telegraph codes is unprecedented in the world. The reason is that the structure of Chinese characters is too complex, so this unavoidable method is adopted. These points have already been discussed earlier, so I won’t repeat them here.</p>
<p>Since each Chinese character is limited to being composed of a telegraph code including four digits, the telegraph code combination that serves as the representative of the Chinese character is naturally counted as one word for every four digits—that is, representing one Chinese character—when calculating the number of words. If there are number groups in the telegram that must be used to accurately represent numbers, Arabic numerals can also be used directly, but a pair of parentheses must be added before and after the number group to avoid confusion with the telegraph code combinations representing Chinese characters. These number groups written in parentheses are also counted as one word for every four digits. If there are decimal points and other symbols, each symbol is counted as one digit. The parenthesis symbols added before and after the number group can be free of charge in domestic telegrams, but to make the meaning clear and meet the conditions that clear text telegrams must possess, an appropriate unit word, such as "yuan," "pieces," etc., must be added after each number group. For example:</p>
<p>(Example 1) "Shouxing yarn 1,500 bales" originally contains eight words. If written as "Shouxing yarn (1500) bales," it is counted as only five words for the fee.</p>
<p>(Example 2) "Unit price eighty-seven yuan and five jiao" originally contains eight words. If written as "Unit price (87·50) yuan," it is counted as only five words for the fee (because the number group in parentheses, including the decimal point, has exceeded four digits and should be counted as two words). Here, please consider again, if we write it as "Unit price (87·5 yuan," the meaning is equally clear, and we can save another word when calculating the telegram fee (because the number group in parentheses, including the decimal point, has only four digits).</p>
<p>In recent years, the legal tender has depreciated, and the amounts of money involved in buying and selling are mostly in the hundreds of millions. Therefore, the examples given above are no longer very practical. For example, rather than writing "twenty-five hundred million" as (2,500,000,000), which would be counted as four words for the fee (because there are a total of thirteen digits, including the apostrophes, which must be counted as four words), it is better to write "twenty-five hundred million," which is more straightforward. To avoid national customers suffering losses, the Telecommunications Bureau has recently added a temporary measure, which is to allow writing "twenty-five hundred million" as "(25) hundred million," so that it only needs to be counted as two words for the fee, which is ultimately more cost-effective than writing it out completely.</p>
<p>Regarding the methods of saving words in the wording of Chinese telegram drafts, although I don't want to provide specific examples, I would like to contribute some personal insights for readers to consider. Everyone knows that drafting commercial telegrams using the style of writing articles or letters is something that fools do. However, based on my observations from checking telegram copies, I feel that in addition to the style, we can go a step further and change the "words" used in the telegram draft to single characters that are sufficient to express the complete meaning, depending on the situation. For example, use the character "決 (jué)" to represent "決定 (juédìng, decide)," use the character "收 (shōu)" to represent "收到 (shōudào, received)," use "入 (rù)" to represent "收入 (shōurù, income)," etc. The reason why we say "depending on the situation" is that some "words" may seem similar on the surface, but in fact, they have different meanings. For example, "收到 (shōudào, received)" and "收入 (shōurù, income)" have different meanings. The former has the meaning of receiving some physical object, while the latter may only refer to the transfer of accounts. Therefore, when using "substituting characters for words," you must carefully consider and ensure that it does not violate the original meaning as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I am reminded of a very interesting past event: During the Anti-Japanese War, telegrams were subject to inspection. To prevent market disturbances, the authorities deleted all the words used in commercial telegrams sent from various places in the rear areas that described skyrocketing prices. Once, an inspector was slightly negligent and accidentally drew the line that was originally intended to be added to the character "飛 (fēi, soaring)" onto the character "漲 (zhǎng, rising)." I believe that after seeing this telegram, the recipient would not have regarded "價飛 (jià fēi, price soaring)" as "物價飛跌 (wùjià fēidié, prices plummeting)," right? From this, we can infer another new insight: Under the principle of not hindering the original meaning, some phrases composed of an adjective and a verb can also be represented by just one adjective. On the other hand, some clever and shrewd senders have already formulated some commonly used telegram terms in the invisible. For example, adding a "電 (diàn, telegraph)" character before an amount, such as "電百億元 (diàn bǎi yì yuán, telex 10 billion yuan)," means "a telegraphic transfer of 10 billion yuan." However, the same two characters "速電 (sù diàn, fast telegraph)" have two different meanings. We can interpret it as "reply by telegram quickly" or "telegraphic transfer quickly." You must understand it intuitively to be able to use it flexibly.</p>
<p>Chinese coded telegrams are only applicable to domestic telegrams and are stipulated to be composed of groups of four or five numbers. Each group is counted as one word for the fee. If there are combinations in the telegram that are composed of fewer than four or more than five numbers, the entire telegram must be counted as a foreign language letter telegram. The price of domestic Chinese coded telegrams and foreign language letter telegrams is the same. Counting as a foreign language letter telegram here is equivalent to saying that all the numbers used to compose number combinations in the telegram are counted as one word if they are within five numbers, and as two words if they exceed five numbers but are less than ten numbers, and so on by analogy.</p>
<p>If there are number combinations in Chinese coded telegrams that are actually used to represent numbers, Arabic numerals can also be used directly, and parentheses symbols can be placed before and after the combination. Regardless of whether the codes in the telegram are composed of four or five numbers, each group is counted as one word for the fee if it is within five numbers. If there are decimal points and other symbols in the group, each symbol is regarded as one digit. The parentheses added before and after are free of charge, just like in Chinese clear text telegrams, but for telegrams treated as foreign language letter telegrams, each pair of parentheses (including the opening and closing parentheses) should be counted as one word separately.</p>
<p>International telegrams made in Chinese code must be treated as letter telegrams for the entire telegram, which will be discussed later.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Car</h3>
<p>— This Publication's Data Room</p>
<p>At the "150 Years of Progress in Science Exposition" held in Baltimore, USA, at the end of last year, Western Union displayed a novel item in the telecommunications industry, a telegraph office mounted on a car—the "Telecommunications Car." This car was tested in the suburbs of Baltimore and achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Looking back on history, the first telegram sent from Washington on May 24, 1844, was received by Baltimore. And now it should be very appropriate historically for this place to accept the testing of this invention.</p>
<p>When the "Telecommunications Car" travels in the designated residential area, the telegrams sent from the "Facsimile" transmitter of Western Union's Baltimore Bureau can be received by it through ultra-shortwave radio equipment. A "Facsimile" recorder is installed under the machine board of the vehicle, and these telegrams are automatically received by this recorder. Every telegram received is exactly the same as the original one sent. The messenger can immediately drive to the address indicated on the telegram and complete a very rapid delivery.</p>
<p>All telegrams or reply telegrams are collected by the messenger on the "Telecommunications Car" and quickly sent by radio to Western Union, and then forwarded by Western Union to various receiving locations. Mr. Lou Liang, the general manager of Western Union stationed in Baltimore, said: "During the experimental period, the 'Telecommunications Car' was designated to travel within a 12-square-mile area in the north of the city each time. When it travels to the area, any telegrams sent to that area are immediately sent from the Baltimore headquarters to the 'Telecommunications Car.'"</p>
<p>Looking back at the existing mobile telegraph offices in our country, although they do not have "Facsimile" equipment, they also have ultra-shortwave radio communication for rapid transmission. In the future, with gradual improvement, it may well become a "Telecommunications Car."</p>

<h3>Despite Slight Improvement in Loose Monetary Policy, Prices Rise Again Across the Board Yesterday; Rice Market Soars, Specially Selected Japonica Rice Exceeds 60 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, prices rose again across the board, with the loose monetary policy being the biggest reason. The rice market rose due to high prices in Wuxi, with top-grade white japonica rice reaching 61 million yuan. Wheat flour prices also rose sharply due to increased purchases from the northern provinces. Fine cotton yarn and cloth prices were buoyant due to purchases by weaving factories. Silk exports were relatively active, leading to significant price increases. Western medicines rose in price due to increased costs. Although sales of tobacco and soap were not high, they were affected by other price increases and rose sharply. The financial market was excited, with Chinese stocks hovering near their peak. Gold jewelry prices continued to rise, with purchase prices at 520 million yuan and selling prices at 560 million yuan, still with demand exceeding supply. Exchange certificates once rose to 7.4 million yuan, but slightly declined at noon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the monetary policy in this city was unusually loose, and the commodity market rose across the board. The "Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury" had an advance of 115.25 billion yuan in the clearing of bills of exchange among the banking and money industries, with the Central Bank alone having an advance of 39.632 billion yuan, the largest amount. The Bank of China had an advance of 20.19 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 26.871 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 4.319 billion yuan, the Central Trust of China had an advance of 12.36 billion yuan, the Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau had a deficit of 2.887 billion yuan, the Central Cooperative Treasury had an advance of 2.715 billion yuan, the commercial banks and money houses had a deficit of 8.32 billion yuan in large clearings and a deficit of 19.47 billion yuan in small clearings. Foreign banks had a total advance of 87.77 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Surges, Grains and Oil Soar</h3>
<p>Rice Market: The rice market is surging fiercely. Top-grade japonica rice has crossed the 60 million yuan mark, reaching a new price of 61 million yuan, a 10% increase. Prices in green production areas have risen, and arrivals have decreased. Other prices have also reached unprecedented levels. Holders have extremely firm intentions, raising prices by 2-3 million yuan early in the market. Subsequently, due to urgent replenishment by rice shops, market conditions were buoyant and unrelenting, leading to a further increase of 2-3 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling an increase of 5-6 million yuan. Thin rice reached 59 million yuan. Xitang new indica rice opened at 50 million yuan. Rice cargo owners are holding back and selling little, resulting in few transactions. Yesterday, arrivals in the two markets were 3,558 piculs.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour: Flourishing and reaching new highs daily. Yesterday, all brands of flour had broken through the 20 million yuan mark, an increase of about 15%. This is because wheat prices are high, and factories are increasing their offers, with very firm intentions. Lao Che opened at 20.9 million yuan and rapidly climbed to a high price of 22.3 million yuan at the close, an increase of 2.8 million yuan. Bing Chuan, Hong Feng, and Jian Cheng were each at 21.5 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour rose buoyantly by more than 2 million yuan. Large bags of bran rose by 2 million yuan. Wheat was at 29 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Reaching unprecedented levels, rising sharply across the board. People are excited due to the sharp rise in rice prices. The yellow soybean market is very active with customers from other provinces. Jiujiang winter soybeans are being cleared by oil merchants at 40 million yuan, an increase of 4 million yuan. Corn from Qingdao continues to be added, rising by 3 million yuan. Wheat from Shantou is also joining in the purchase, with northern buyers rushing to advance even more urgently, adding 5 million yuan. Broad beans are priced 2 million higher. The sesame market is sluggish, with only a slight increase. Peas are also up 1-2 million yuan. Sesame is up by 6-7 million yuan, with white sesame reaching a high price of 90 million yuan. Raw peanuts are scarce and have unanimously broken through the 100 million yuan mark. Xuzhou raw peanuts are at 102 million yuan, an increase of 14 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Rising sharply again. Due to the significant increase in yellow soybeans, factories feel the increased cost and are also insisting on high prices. Retailers are holding their ground even more forcefully. Due to the large increases in other prices, the market has leaped upward. Soybean oil initially traded at 162 million yuan, retreated to 158 million yuan in the middle, and then rebounded to 160 million yuan at the close, ultimately rising by 20 million yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose by about 20 million yuan. Raw oil jumped wildly by 23 million yuan. A barrel of raw oil costs 198 million yuan, approaching the 200 million yuan mark. Small-cart sesame oil rose by 1.5 million yuan. Soybean cake prices surged surprisingly, due to being favored by Shantou buyers, rising sharply by a significant 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Control Bureau Reviewing Results of Inspection of Banks and Money Houses</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Responsible officials of the Gold Control Bureau, in the past two days, convened all external investigators to review and report on the results of the recent inspection of banks and money houses. If any illegal activities are found in their operations, they will be reported. The results of this review will be released early next week.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ten banks and money houses that were previously announced by the Bureau to have violated regulations have been ordered to replace their responsible personnel. It is now known that some of these ten banks and money houses have already changed their managers, assistant managers, and senior responsible staff. However, the Gold Control Bureau, in order to investigate responsibility, will still conduct an investigation to determine who is responsible and will punish them according to the law.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Close Weak, Bond Market Strong and Steady</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were initially weak but then buoyant yesterday, but the amplitude was narrow, and the trend was meandering. Later, prices outside the ring trended higher, showing some signs of improvement. However, due to rumors of unfavorable news for the stock market and tightening monetary conditions, they closed weak.</p>
<p>Yongsha opened at 16,400 yuan in the morning, higher than yesterday's closing price by 100 yuan. Numbers 65, 168, 92, and 220 came in, and although it rose to 16,680 yuan, it became hesitant due to news of tensions in Berlin and the Lushan Conference. Also, since it was Friday, many parties had to bear two days' interest, so numbers 207, 99, 61, 152, 178, 183, and 48 and others vigorously sold off. Short sellers took the opportunity to enter, and prices fell, retreating to a low price of 16,180 yuan. Short positions were covered, and numbers 65, 169, 226, 76, and 154 all came to maintain the price, recovering to 16,400 yuan. However, people's hearts were weak and lacked support, so numbers 35, 71, and 61 came to buy at 16,200 yuan. After 10:30, news spread that yarn and daily necessities were rising alarmingly, and market sentiment began to improve, and buying interest suddenly increased. Short sellers were afraid and forcefully covered their positions. Numbers 117, 180, 76, 98, and 155 came in, and it rose again to 16,600 yuan. There was a slight meandering in the middle. Although numbers 116, 35, 56, and 206 came to sell at 16,300 yuan, because people's hearts improved, numbers 205, 65, 228, 154, 193, 178, 71, 78, 13, and 54 all came to buy, and retail investors followed suit, trending upward again. If the Central South Bank had not vigorously sold off at the close, Yongsha would not have ended at 15,800 yuan. Small stocks such as Xinguang, Qinxing, and Jingfu were favored and showed some signs of improvement because they had been quiet for a long time. As a result, compared to yesterday's close, Shangwu, Zhongfa, Xinyi, Zhabei, Yonggong, Yongdi, and Liandi rose to their limit. Jinglun and Xinhua rose more than half a percent strongly. Except for Zhongni, which fell to its limit, Yongsha, Xinguang, Jingfu, and others all saw slight increases.</p>
<p>Buying interest was even stronger in the afternoon. Yongsha immediately entered the market at 17,300 yuan. Numbers 187, 65, 207, and 168 and others all came to support the price, rising to 17,650 yuan. It was initially hoped that it would flourish, but the environment was unfavorable. The national banks had an advance of over 100 billion yuan, and monetary conditions tightened. There were many rumors, and the bulls' efforts were thwarted. The momentum then declined again. Numbers 117, 218, 156, 71, 176, 116, 178, and 224 and others sold off, and although there was still some meandering, only because the time had arrived, Yongsha ended at 17,050 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Zhongfa, Zhongchuan, Xinyi, Yongdi, and Liandi rose to their limit. The remaining stocks saw slight increases or remained flat. Unlisted stocks outside the market all reported increases of 10-20%.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The rumor of currency reform became more heated, accumulating into a buoyant peak. Tongbing opened at 1.9 million yuan and immediately rose rapidly. Although room 360 Chengde sold off, rooms 552 and 550 took in at high prices, and it ultimately rose to a high price of 2.08 million yuan at the close. A and B also rose strongly by more than 10% compared to the previous close. Ding and Wu rose by 140,000 and 150,000 yuan respectively.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Finance, Reducing Idle Capital: Restrictions on Shanghai Remittances from North China to Be Imposed Again</h3>
<p>[News from the Commodity Research Institute] It is rumored that restrictions on Shanghai remittances from North China will be imposed again, which has had a considerable impact on people's sentiment. Many expect that if this move is implemented, the trend of monetary conditions in this city may temporarily change.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the government, in order to stabilize finance in Nanjing and Shanghai and reduce idle capital in the market, has decided to further limit the amount of remittances from various parts of North China to Shanghai. This financial severance policy seems to be a matter of great urgency, and the authorities will no longer pay attention to the opposition from people in North China and will resolutely implement measures. However, general observation is that after the severance, capital from North China will inevitably be transported in the form of cash, and the cash shortage in the North may become unbearable.</p>
<p>[News from the Joint Exchange] The financial authorities here, in order to assist the government in stabilizing prices, are still strictly limiting the amount of funds remitted to Shanghai by national banks and agricultural banks, in order to prevent idle capital from concentrating and stimulating the market again. The total amount remitted to Shanghai each day in the past has been reduced to 300 or 400 billion yuan, depending on the situation. Remittances from North China will also be significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Committee, Trade Committee Discussing Loan Applications</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bank Rediscount Committee Trade Advisory Committee held its sixth meeting at 3 pm yesterday. Chairman Li Daofu presided, and all members participated. Four loan applications for rediscounting were discussed. The meeting approved the Bank of Communications' application for rediscounting loans for eight companies, including the China Vegetable Oil Factory, and two cases transferred from the Four Joint Offices regarding the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association's request to adjust the loan amount for this year's export tea and extend the collateral deadline. The above two approved cases will still be submitted to the Rediscount Committee's regular meeting next Monday for approval.</p>
<h3>Fresh Egg Yolks Shipped to Little Luzon</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Aus-New Line's Aros, managed by Da Xiang Yang Hang, returned to Australia from Shanghai for the first time yesterday, carrying a large batch of 7,500 boxes of fresh egg yolks to Little Luzon.</p>
<h3>National Goods Joint Operation Company Promoting Overseas Markets</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Joint Operation Company recently announced that the overseas market for national goods is flourishing. In addition to the continued export of cotton yarn and cloth, other goods are roughly divided into two categories: 1. Those that are designed to expand the scope of exports include more than ten companies such as the famous domestic Yapuer Huade light bulbs and Wuhe undershirts. 2. Those that already have a considerable amount of exports and are expanding their regions include Huasheng electric fans, China enamel porcelain, Yongsheng vacuum bottles, Feilun wood yarn, He Cheng factories towels, Shenyu socks, Hanyang handkerchiefs, etc., in order to develop national goods overseas in many aspects.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Reach New Highs, Leading Fine Cloth Approaches 90 Million Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was active due to still loose monetary conditions, rising prices of various goods outside the industry, and eager purchases from local and out-of-town buyers. The industry players were actively trading among themselves. Inventories were depleted, and sentiment was exceptionally high.</p>
<p>The holders of 42-count blue phoenix fine yarn asked for 300 million yuan at the opening, willing to sell only at that price. Buyers mostly waited and watched, seeing that the price had reached its peak. Subsequently, it was learned that the yarn market in Qingdao was rising, and buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other provinces were active, so the trend became even stronger, rising to 3.35 billion yuan for immediate delivery and 3.4 billion yuan for delivery tomorrow, continuing to rise wildly by 350 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose sharply by 80-90 million to 150-160 million yuan each, with 80 lots traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, stimulated by the increased allocation price of Fangjian the day before, and with insufficient inventories, the market price of 12-yard leading fine cloth rose by another 8 million yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to news of economic plans being discussed in Lushan and rumors of currency reform, sentiment in the market suddenly weakened, and many speculative holders began to sell off. Buyers from North China also sold at high prices, and the market saw a decline of 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after 10 o'clock, because monetary conditions were still loose and the weather was gradually turning cool in the autumn, actual sales were about to begin, and buyers from other provinces became stronger. New buyers also came into action, and the leading market price rose again to 88 million yuan at the close, up 9 million yuan compared to the previous day (asking prices outside the market rose by another 3.5 million yuan).</p>
<p>The prices of mid- and low-end fine cloth such as Wufu, Laba, Tongyang, and He were also similar due to inquiries from dyeing factories, and the remaining fine twill, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and serge cloth, khaki cloth, etc., were also firm and steady. 1,800 pieces were traded.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the market price outside the market declined in the afternoon. Leading fine cloth was initially priced at 92.5 million yuan, but there were not many new buyers, and there was no shortage of high-priced sales, and the market reported a low price. By the end, however, the price of 90 million yuan was held, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to the afternoon close. The price of Sijunzi Yuan serge was also 1.7 million yuan higher, but transactions were very rare.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the China Textile Company yesterday allocated yarn for the Central Bank and the Yarn Management Committee, with 273 eligible purchasers, allocating 683 lots, of which 101 lots belonged to the Central Bank and 582 lots belonged to the Yarn Management Committee, collecting 141.066 billion yuan. The China Textile Company also sold 892 lots of yarn, collecting 23.838 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Export Green Tea Booming</h3>
<p>Green teas such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei have been sold to North Africa in large quantities. However, since the asking price in this area has become stingy, transactions have been quiet at one point. However, because the Xinhua Tea Company first obtained a reply allowing it to increase prices, it has been reported that the Wu Chang Tea Company, etc., has also received a letter allowing it to relax tea prices, so the Huang Na has gradually increased, and the process has suddenly been revived. Unfortunately, it is ultimately affected by the empty warehouse, which is far from meeting the needs, so the amount of Wei Jiao is still inferior. In terms of price, it is more profitable on the rising exchange certificate. As for Qimen black tea, there is a continued demand and a shortage of supply. The potential is revealed in the quiet. As for the two types of crude tea, fried green and baked green, they are still only consumed domestically in a scattered manner, and the situation is meandering as before.</p>
<h3>Demand for Chinese Medicine Sluggish</h3>
<p>The trend of Chinese medicine is weak. Local demand is sluggish, and the allocation of goods from other provinces is also fragmented. Many of the sourced goods have been repackaged into small boxes and small packages to meet current needs. 34 packages of Zhu Ling were received by mail. The customer price opened at 4 million yuan for Zhu Ling Wang, with only 6 mail packages, 2.2 million yuan for Ti Zhu Ling, with 8 mail packages, and 1.8 million yuan for Yuan Zhu Ling, with 20 mail packages.</p>
<p>Six packages of four-legged tiger bones were received by mail yesterday. The customer requested a price of 12 million yuan today. The merchant is currently unable to accept the offer due to the tightening of monetary conditions, and also because the market is quiet, so no price has been offered.</p>
<h3>Business Conditions in Various Places</h3>
<p>Shenyang [Report from this newspaper in Shenyang on the 13th] A sudden autumn price increase has occurred. On the 13th, sorghum was 400,000 yuan per catty, soybeans were 200,000, pork was 700,000, soybean oil was 800,000, Bingchuan flour was 18 million, Yizhi Tiannv yarn was 40 million, Da Xiang cigarettes were 1.9 million per pack, and gold opened at 95 million (all in circulating currency).</p>
<p>Zhenjiang [Report from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 13th] Prices in Zhenjiang rose wildly again today. Top-grade rice was 5,600, wheat was 5,300, Green Jinshan flour was 20.5 million, soybean oil was 160 million per load, 20-count Xing Shi small package was 58.5 million, and Leading fine cloth was 94 million. Wuyang rose by 20% compared to yesterday. The purchase price of jewelry was 500 million, and the selling price was 560 million.</p>
<h3>Export Commodity Prices Rise: Export Exchange Settlement Reaches Over 3 Million US Dollars Last Week</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Export Management Committee recently issued a brief statement classifying the domestic and foreign market prices of China's main export commodities within the past week as follows:</p>
<p>In the first half of this week (August 1st to 7th), monetary conditions were tight, and general prices were stable. In the second half of the week, prices rose across the board. Major export products such as tung oil, bristles, raw silk, yarn, cotton fabrics, and oilseeds also rose. This was especially true at the end of the week, resulting in an average increase of about 15% in export goods this week compared to last week. Foreign market prices were stable except for tung oil and peanut oil, which fell. The market sentiment for exchange certificates was also good, breaking through the 7 million mark at the end of the week. The weekly average was about 5,650,000 yuan, an increase of 44% compared to last week. This is very stimulating to exports. The following is a brief description of the domestic and foreign market conditions for several major export products.</p>
<p>Tung Oil: Domestic prices rose sharply. Top-quality tung oil rose from 100 million yuan to 155 million yuan per market load, an increase of 50% within the week. Foreign prices fell instead. At the end of the week, the price in New York fell to US $0.20 per pound, and the price in London was £148 per British ton. The reason is rumored to be that a powerful exporter was dumping at low prices in the United States. General exporters are optimistic about exchange certificates, and devaluation sales and smuggling exports to South China also have an impact.</p>
<p>Bristles: Costs are also gradually increasing. At the beginning of the week, Shanghai and Hankou bristles each rose to 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion yuan per Sima load, an increase of 20-30% respectively, and the market was unstable. At the end of the week, Shanghai 17th grade surged to 2.1 billion. Foreign prices were very stable. Due to the surge in the price of exchange certificates, exports of various colors of Shanghai and Hankou bristles can make a profit of 10-30%. Tianjin bristles, on the other hand, lose 2-3%. Exports are still active. Exports in the last month reached 3,000 loads. The largest market is still the United States.</p>
<p>Tea: New goods have been launched on the market. This week, black tea and green tea each rose by 40% and 30%. Calculated by exchange certificates, although black tea is slightly loss-making, green tea exports are still profitable. With the assistance of the China Agricultural Bank's tea loan, the quality of new tea has improved, but the output is only 70% of last year. Although foreign merchants who received samples were satisfied, they were stingy with their offers, and it is difficult to hope for transactions to start. Therefore, the foreign tea market has been bleak recently.</p>
<p>Raw Silk: The price has risen sharply this week. The initial price of grade B 83 uniformity factory silk was 2.45 billion per package at the beginning of the week, and rose to 2.95 billion on Saturday, an increase of 20%. The foreign price in New York is still US $3.30 per pound. Export losses are very large, and exports are extremely sluggish. Japanese silk has recently begun to rise, adding a strong enemy to sales. However, French raw silk importers are still fond of our silk, such as Jin Shuang Lu brand.</p>
<p>Feathers: The market for dry casings is still stable. The increase in the actual price of exchange certificates is beneficial for exports.</p>
<p>Beans and Seeds: Domestic prices of beans and seeds are rising gradually. Soybeans and broad beans each rose by 30%. Sesame seeds and rapeseed rose sharply by 50%. Sesame exports barely cover costs, and the rest are loss-making. The market price of oils has also increased by about 20-30%. Except for rapeseed oil, which can make a profit of 10%, the rest have a loss of about 10%.</p>
<p>Rhubarb: There is no foreign demand. Musk has no buyers. There is no profit in exporting gallnuts and camphor.</p>
<p>Exchange: The export merchants' requests for exchange settlement in Shanghai this week (August 1st to 7th) have been statistically completed. The total amount has decreased slightly compared to last week, reaching a total of US $3,402,673.04. Among them, US $1,589,349.30 was sold to ordinary designated banks, and US $1,813,323.74 was sold by the government itself.</p>
<p>By commodity, the exports included US $576,220.89 in bristles, US $23.60 in tung oil, US $45,342.77 in fur, US $3,732.00 in green oil, US $45,252.82 in tea, US $42,627.39 in straw hats, US $6,596.10 in hog casings, US $20,611.36 in feathers, US $18,177.07 in metals and their products, US $1,867.50 in woolen yarn and raw silk, US $26,273.85 in fresh eggs, US $74,242.61 in cotton fabrics, US $39,212.93 in wool, US $21,305.20 in silk fabrics, US $16,294.80 in vegetables and their products, US $651,568.41 in miscellaneous items, US $204,962.08 in frozen eggs, US $1,246,201.15 in cotton cloth, and US $362,160.51 in cotton yarn.</p>

<h3>World Games Closing Ceremony Tonight; Chinese Basketball Team Ranked 18th; Sweden Defeats Yugoslavia in Football Final</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): In the World Games football final, Sweden defeated Yugoslavia 3-1 to win the championship. Denmark defeated Great Britain.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): In the World Games basketball game, Mexico defeated Brazil, with a halftime score of 25-17.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): The 14th Olympic World Games will close on the 14th. The closing ceremony will be held at 6 pm, and all competitions will be concluded. There will be equestrian competitions on the 14th morning and afternoon, held at the Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): In the third-division ranking final of the World Games basketball game, the Chinese team could not compete with the strong fighting spirit of Italy due to discord among its soldiers. As a result of the fierce battle, the team lost 38-54. At halftime, China was 4 points behind at 25-21. Italy won the third-division championship, ranking 17th, while China ranked 18th. Huang Tianxi, the 6-foot-2-inch guard of the Chinese team, had left England ahead of schedule, making the already short-handed Chinese defense even more stretched. All the players, with their return imminent, longing for home like arrows, were also one of the reasons for the decline in fighting spirit. At the start of the game, the Chinese team played with Bao Songguo, Li Zhenzhong, Cai Wenhua, Li Shiqiao, and Wu Chengzhang. At the beginning of the game, they were able to perform above standard. Songyuan and Chengzhang scored repeatedly under the basket, and Shiqiao and Wenhua also occasionally made good plays, allowing them to take the lead. However, China's leading situation was only a flash in the pan. After 15 minutes, the Chinese team members gradually felt physically exhausted, and Italy took the opportunity to chase hard. The score went from close to tied, and then exceeded. China frequently substituted with reserve players, but there was still no improvement, and then they were unable to recover. Italy took the lead 25-21 in the first half. After changing sides, Jia Zhijun replaced Wenhua, and Cai Zhongqiang replaced Shiqiao. These new recruits had very few opportunities to play after arriving in England, so they played very hard. However, Italy also fought with all their strength and did not relax. When it was 38-25, Zhongqiang made a free throw, and Italy immediately returned the ball. Lao Bao fouled, and the Italian team added another point. The Chinese defender, Lao Bao, often defended far out, and Da Li was also in a state of exhaustion. Several times, the Italian forwards got the ball and rushed straight, traversing the Chinese basket as if entering an uninhabited place. When it was 45-29, Lao Bao's long shot failed, and Zhongqiang failed to shoot three times under the basket, and the Chinese team was stolen for two points instead. The Chinese team's defeat was a foregone conclusion, and only showed a slight struggle to do its best. At the end of the game, China lost eight goals with a score of 38-54.</p>
<h3>China's Failure at the World Games: Physical Disparity Too Great, Xu Minhui and Li Huitang Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 13th (via radio): The 14th Olympic Games will conclude tomorrow. The Chinese delegation has packed and awaits their flight home. A special correspondent from the BBC interviewed the team's director and coaches, requesting their reflections on the trip. The conversations will be recorded and broadcast to the Far East via the BBC radio station.</p>
<p>Xu Minhui, a veteran of the sports scene who participated in the previous games as a swimming instructor and coach, believes the primary reason Chinese athletes have not been able to compete effectively with European and American countries in sports is their inherently weaker physical constitution. Xu stated, "China has failed to win any medals in the track and field events and other sports at the Games. This is fundamentally because there is too great a difference in physical build between the Chinese and Europeans and Americans. This is especially evident in the track and field pentathlon, where it is almost impossible to compare with Europeans and Americans. In track events, the gap is somewhat smaller. Although the difference in results in the intermediate hurdles was not large, it is regrettable that Chen Yinglang was eliminated in the 400 meters, finishing third by just an arm's length. Qi Wen'ao should have scored in the 10,000-meter race, but unfortunately, he failed due to various obstacles. On the final day, he fought hard in the marathon, and although he did not finish the entire race due to physical limitations, he maintained a leading position for the first half, making his defeat honorable. If Huang, Chen, and Lou can work even harder, I am extremely hopeful for them to score in the 15th Games in 1953."</p>
<p>Li Huitang, the captain of the football team at the previous World Games and this year's football coach, also believes that physical strength is the biggest factor influencing China's failure to reach world football standards. Regarding tactics, he stated, "Currently, the strong European teams are using the third-back defensive formation, but they have not mastered it completely. They easily fall apart when facing a stronger opposing attack. The biggest weakness of the Chinese team is that their physical strength and stamina are far inferior to others. This was the first time we participated, and the fact that we lost four games in a row was largely due to physical factors. For Chinese football to reach world standards, it is necessary to promote rising talents and focus on fundamentally improving physical fitness. The best approach is to learn from European countries and hire British coaches to return to China and train new talent."</p>

<h3>Changes to International Basketball Rules: Preventing Tall Players from Gaining an Advantage, Widening Free Throw Area, Adopting Three-Second Rule, Approved by International Basketball Association Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 13th (via radio): The Rules Subcommittee of the International Amateur Basketball Association voted on Wednesday to widen the narrow, elongated section of the free throw area near the basket from six feet to twelve feet, hoping to help shorter guards and reduce the chances of seven-foot giants putting the ball in the basket. This change may be the most progressive rules reform in twenty years.</p>
<p>The American "three-second rule" was also adopted. This rule will prevent all players from staying in the free throw area for more than three seconds. Although the subcommittee did not specifically announce the motive for adopting this rule, it is clear that the "three-second rule" is designed to prevent seven-foot giants from standing under the basket as "goaltenders," blocking the ball from entering the basket. According to the new rules, the free throw area will be shaped like a city gate. During free throws, no players are allowed to enter the "city gate area" until the ball touches the backboard or rim. After the ball touches the backboard, players can, of course, rush in to grab the ball, but they still cannot stay for more than three seconds.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Being Fierce in Appearance but Weak Within</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>The weather is extremely sultry. Although it is already the beginning of autumn, there is no hint of coolness. I can only recline on my bamboo bed and read something that doesn't require much brainpower. Yesterday, I flipped through Mr. Wu's Twenty Years' Witness to Strange Happenings in Foshan. This is a very ordinary book, but today, especially for people like us who have experienced a bit of hardship, it has a different meaning. I can't help but admire Mr. Wu even more.</p>
<p>Although the second half of this book is still fragmented, it seems to be mostly represented by "Gou Cai." Gou Cai is probably also the Typical character of the entire book. After he ingratiated himself with the errand boy of the silver dollar bureau in Anqing Province and made a fortune, a five-province imperial envoy suddenly arrived to investigate various corruption cases. The imperial envoy was initially very fierce and said to be incorruptible, but eventually, Gou Cai found a connection, spent 600,000 taels of silver, and was acquitted. The book criticizes this imperial envoy as a person who is "fierce in appearance but weak within." These four words unexpectedly moved me deeply.</p>
<p>The Record of Officials' Appearances in Nanting Pavilion also records many imperial envoys investigating corruption cases, and the results are similar to those of the nine-province imperial envoy, almost becoming a formula. Once, an imperial envoy absolutely refused to meet guests and did not speak, making him even more unfathomable. Later, someone in the know said that this was called "drawing the bow without releasing the arrow," and the reason for not releasing it was to wait for a good price. Eventually, through the mediation of several brokers, everyone satisfied their own desires.</p>
<p>When we examine the identities of those who are weak within, we find that they are mostly "seeds of scholars." The reason for this is "worthy of deep thought."</p>
<p>Confucius cannot be said to be not stern. He killed Shaozheng Mao for his heterodox views, banished the seductive Zheng melodies, and even found fault with the color purple because it stole Zhu. But when he lost power and traveled far away, why did he go to see the petty ruler of Wei? This made Zilu very unhappy, and later generations of "unorthodox" people were even happier to add fuel to the fire, turning the "sound of jade pendants" into an opera, insulting the sage. Even someone as obedient as I can't help but suspect that the old master's "not walking to the Zhejiang River" and his unwillingness to ride with Yong Qu had other reasons! The problem is very simple. Scholars take "unifying the world with Yao and Shun" as their duty. Over time, they become "four limbs unaccustomed to labor, five grains undifferentiated," only able to play the role of "teacher." Therefore, once they lose their jobs, apart from rushing around and "carrying praises when leaving the country," they are left with only "being anxious."</p>
<p>Of course, if one is right, one is confident. As Mencius said, "accumulated righteousness generates energy," "its energy is extremely great and strong, and can fill the space between heaven and earth." Logically speaking, scholars should accumulate the most righteousness, and their energy should be the most righteous and greatest, so there is no weakness. However, knowledge is not necessarily all righteousness, it also allows people to understand "profit and loss." If profit and loss are based on the individual, they will undoubtedly contradict righteousness. Therefore, when it comes to risking one's life in danger, they will think about how painful it is to have a knife cut their shin, and they will confirm Yang Zhu's philosophy: "Living as Jie or Zhou, dying as rotten bones; living as Yao or Shun, dying as rotten bones. Rotten bones are the same, who knows the difference?" The former may be understood by carters and porters, but the latter can only be understood by those who have drunk ink. Therefore, what the ancients said about "it is difficult to die calmly" is because when one can be calm, there is plenty of time to consider these issues, so even a hundred-refined steel will turn into a soft touch, and one will become dispirited. Conversely, ordinary people who do not have these considerations probably only know one truth, such as "repaying kindness" or "clear distinction between gratitude and resentment," and with one breath, they can do earth-shattering things. Wu Meicun's Lu Qiao Jiwen, Volume 2, "The Fall of Yu Yuan," has two chapters specifically discussing these people. For example, the chapter on "Servants" records that Commander Cao Cunxing wanted to surrender Nanjing to the Manchus, but his soldiers refused to surrender and threw themselves off the bridge to die; Marquis Anyuan Liu Changzuo surrendered to Prince Yu, and one of his soldiers stopped him, but he did not listen and threw himself into the river to die; there are many similar facts. The chapter on "Beggars" records that the Qinhuai beggar who refused to surrender to the Northern Army even wrote a poem before his death: "For three hundred years, the court has supported scholars, how can civil and military officials all escape? The moral principles remain in the lowly field court, and beggars are ashamed to preserve a life!" This poem is obviously an exaggeration by later generations, and even the facts may have to be discounted, but it is a great satire when compared to the commander and marquis. What a pity that Mr. Wu himself was also fierce in appearance but weak within, and eventually became a "sacrificial wine" that was "worthless"!</p>
<p>This is called "the distinction between righteousness and profit, difficult to speak of!"</p>
<h3>Wine, Women, and Extravagant Living: The Princes of India</h3>
<p>— Yanbo</p>
<p>Last year on August 15th, India gained independence and was divided into two countries: India and Pakistan. Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>However, before August 15th of last year, India was in fact already more than one country. When the British Empire ruled India, it used five hundred and sixty-three sets of laws. The India that produced Gandhi and Nehru was just one of these five hundred and sixty-three countries. The other five hundred and sixty-two were princely states of varying sizes. After the partition of India and Pakistan, five hundred princely states joined India, sixty-one joined Pakistan, and only the largest and richest Hyderabad remained independent, as it had been.</p>
<p>The Indian government plans to merge these five hundred princely states into twenty-five units. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Patel believes that this is necessary to promote democracy. However, Nehru strongly advocates maintaining the rights of these princes, as long as they recognize the rule of the new Indian state and allow the Indian government to manage foreign affairs, military affairs, and transportation, they can still maintain their original status.</p>
<p>These princely rulers gladly agreed and still receive an annual salary of nine million US dollars. However, they can no longer live the extravagant life they once had.</p>
<p>The late *Life* magazine correspondent in India, Fischer, recorded the stories of these Indian princes' wealth and debauchery in a monograph. Here are some excerpts for the readers.</p>
<p>These princes liked novel and fun things. One prince specially manufactured a machine. As long as he pressed a button, the room would immediately be filled with the fragrance of various perfumes. India is extremely hot and has many mosquitoes. Sometimes when the prince could not bear the disturbance of mosquitoes, he would press another button on the machine, and the room would immediately be filled with fine droplets of Flit insecticide.</p>
<p>Another prince, when hosting banquets, often had a small flying car circling around the long, oval dining table in the center of the dining room. The electric car was filled with various kinds of fine wine. When a guest picked up a wine bottle, the electric car would automatically stop. After the guest poured the wine and returned the bottle to its original place, the electric car would immediately move forward again.</p>
<p>One prince liked to raise dogs and specially built countless exquisite "dog houses," with a large number of people serving these dogs. Sometimes when the prince traveled at sea, the dogs would travel on a separate ship, following him closely. This prince also liked to hunt. Every time he went hunting, he would mobilize a large number of people to set up the hunting grounds for him, including tents for receiving subordinates, tents specifically for bathing, tents for male and female servants, and tents for the prince to rest—decorated with various colors of silk, and the ground was covered with extremely thick carpets.</p>
<p>These princes were naturally "well-fed and warmly clothed" people. Next, we will talk about the issue of women.</p>
<p>There was a princely state called Patiala. Patiala had a prince who married fifty-two wives and had three hundred and fifty children. He gave each wife 10,000 rupees as a betrothal gift, and another 10,000 rupees for her to buy clothes. This expense was of course considerable, so he increased taxes on the people: he was surrounded by women, while the people were in dire straits.</p>
<p>After this prince died, his fifty-two wives were all sent back to their hometowns. A special orphanage was built in the palace to accommodate these three hundred and fifty princes. However, the officials and people of Patiala placed great emphasis on the background of these children. The children born to the former king's "official" wives were all hired with English nannies and entered and exited the palace through the front door. The children born to the "unofficial" wives were all hired with Indian nannies, and if the children wanted to play outside the palace, they could only enter and exit through the back door.</p>
<p>The great prince of Hyderabad, the largest princely state in India mentioned above, is now seventy-two years old. He wears glasses, has a thin figure, but is still very lecherous. He currently has four formal wives and about two hundred concubines. This old man loves money like his life. Everyone says he is the richest man in the world and also the most incorrigible miser. Although he has many wives, he himself lives in a shabby house and wears tattered clothes. One day, an official went to see him, and he happened to be taking a nap. The official frowned and came up with an idea. He calmly took out two silver coins and gently tapped them next to the richest man in the world's ear. The two silver coins made a clear and pleasant tinkling sound—the great prince seemed to perk up, and his sleepiness immediately disappeared!</p>
<h3>Reasons for Divorce</h3>
<p>— Jinlin</p>
<p>In Elizabeth, a woman gave the reason for divorce: "He gives me five dollars every night, and when I fall asleep, he secretly steals it back. In the morning, he scolds me for being careless!" she cried.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, USA, a woman requested a divorce from her husband, the reason being: After she married her husband (a retired naval officer), she had to sleep in a hammock every day. She had fallen out of it sixteen times in twenty-three years. Now that she is older, she can no longer endure the pain of falling.</p>
<p>A husband in Los Angeles complained to the court: "Every time I woo my wife, she asks me for five dollars for a kiss. So five dollars, five dollars, five dollars... such a number is beyond my ability to bear."</p>
<p>"I Have an Ailment" This is the prince of Hyderabad, the largest princely state in India, who is seventy-two years old, has four wives and two hundred concubines. This old man loves money as his life, and he is extremely rich. Some say he is the richest man in the world. (Please refer to the article "The Princes of India.")</p>
<h3>To Chen Julai</h3>
<p>— Fang Chong Shen</p>
<p>Chen Julai of Pinghu is a famous seal carver and a talented disciple of my old friend Yuan Hanyun. He can integrate the Zhejiang and Anhui schools into one, and both intaglio and relief are extremely wonderful.</p>
<p>Hanyun is gone, separated by mountains and rivers, his disciple can do many things, sweeping away the idle gate and moving mountain bones, the small red seals are like Kai Bo.</p>
<p>How many generations have the Zhejiang and Anhui schools been divided? He can combine the six kingdoms and call himself Qin! Look at the dragons and snakes moving under your wrist, you should give gold to others every day.</p>
<h3>Miracle in Shanghai's Music Scene: Harmonica Enters the Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>Just two years after the death of Maestro Pacl, the symphony orchestra he painstakingly founded (formerly the Municipal Council Orchestra, now the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra) has become increasingly small. Violin virtuoso Atler and cello master Dukesen have returned to their countries one after another, and the famous conductor and pianist Magolinsky also left long ago. Today's Municipal Orchestra has only twenty or thirty members left. The treatment is poor and the management is lax. The two summer concerts held since the summer have been lackluster.</p>
<p>Last night (August 11th), the orchestra's second summer symphony concert had an "amazing" program: a harmonica solo accompanied by a symphony orchestra, which was unprecedented. I had to rush from Hongkou District to the French School to hear it. I thought that the harmonica for this solo must be an "atomic" or "super" type, but it turned out to be just a normal chromatic harmonica. All the shortcomings that prevent the harmonica from being a formal instrument are all present in this chromatic harmonica. Therefore, even though its volume was amplified by a single "microphone," it still sounded extremely unharmonious. In the first piece, Kreisler's "Vienna Fantasy," the soloist was only able to show his fast-paced melody technique with the harmonica. Everything else was bland and tasteless, and because the harmonica was passed through a "microphone" while the other accompanying instruments were isolated from the "microphone," there was a particular sense of detachment in terms of volume. This "innovative" program damaged the artistic level and abused the ears of countless listeners!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that: (1) The harmonica's sound depends only on blowing and sucking, and its expression of melody is extremely limited. For example, if several notes in a quick tempo are all blown or sucked, and are all continuous beats, then it is beyond the endurance of human lung capacity; (2) The harmonica's timbre is dry, weak, and monotonous, and it cannot express the tension and relaxation of emotions and the richness of colors in music. Even if the normal rules of music are ignored and it is played through a microphone, it can only amplify the volume and cannot improve the timbre; (3) The timbre of the harmonica that has passed through the "microphone" is quite similar to the wind instruments in the orchestra that produce sound with reeds. However, in terms of timbre, volume, and range, these wind instruments are more advanced and complete than the harmonica, and the capabilities of other stringed instruments are of course far superior to the harmonica. Therefore, using a symphony orchestra to accompany the harmonica is tantamount to teaching people to listen to the accompaniment and abandon the main melody. Even in the United States, where jazz music is popular, only guitars, saxophones, etc. are included in the band, and it is rare to see a formal orchestra accompany a "harmonica solo." Of course, large harmonica ensembles, combined with accordions, pianos, or other wind and string instruments, are common. The so-called harmonica symphony orchestra also exists in Shanghai. However, these symphonic pieces must be adapted, and are not in their original form (the harmonica solo by the Municipal Orchestra this time was also adapted). Readers can hear the difference between harmonica ensemble symphonies and symphonies played by real orchestras on the radio, and after listening, they will understand: Is the harmonica a "musical toy" or a formal instrument? Should it be accompanied by a formal symphony orchestra?</p>
<p>Of course, the Western musician in charge of the orchestra is not ignorant of these principles. However, one reason is that he was repeatedly requested by the soloist, and another is that there are various difficulties today (it would take a long time to explain), so the program inevitably lacks quality.</p>
<p>There is naturally some justification for this, but for the sake of the art of Shanghai, the largest city in the East, and the next generation of the nation, we really cannot remain silent.</p>
