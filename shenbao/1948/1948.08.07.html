<h3>美援與農村復興</h3>
<p>中國農村復興聯合委員會，已經中美雙方交換照會同意設立，人選也已內定，日內卽可成立。我們反覆誦讀司徒大使的照會及王外長的覆照全文，深知美國在經濟上援助我國復興農村，逐步改進經濟·敎育·衛生，其意義甚為重大，誠如司徒大使所謂：「本人懇切希望研究中國社會及經濟問題之學者，將視本日（八月五日）為中國農村地區狀况趨向健全改進之途的里程碑」。</p>
<p>依照美國援外法案的規定，援華部份本為四億六千三百萬美元，其中軍事援助一億二千五百萬美元，其餘三億三千八百萬美元則為經濟援助；其後又削减為四億美元，軍事援助照原數不减，經濟援助則减為二億七千五百萬美元，其用途以十分之九作緊急生產及購買我國所急需之食糧·棉花·化學肥料·石油暨工業器材等項物資，其餘十分之一，作為復興我國農村之用。又因為前者為救急性質，唯有復興農村部份，才是永久性質的建設用途，故中美雙方對於此事，均十分重視，今年六月初中國經濟調查團東來實地調查並研究建設計劃時，美國農業問題專家梅逸博士，亦會同來調查我國農業經濟情形。此番中美同意設立中國農村復興聯合委員會，足見美國援助中國復興農村，已由宣傳設計而進入具體化階段，凡是關心中國農村情形的人，無不引為當前最可喜的現象。</p>
<p>中國在歷史上一直是「以農立國」的國家，全國人口百分之八十以上是農民，故民食的足與不足，往往是中國歷史上治亂的分水綫；但是近十年來的中國農村，每况愈下，已瀕於破產的邊綠：查在抗戰之前，因為農民的墨守成法，故步自封，再加以連年的天災人禍，中國農村早已衰落；迨至抗戰軍興，廣大的農村淪於日寇佔領之下的，固備受敵偽的破壞與摧殘；就是幸而未被敵人佔領的，也在征實征兵的情形之下，日見其淍敵；勝利之後，本可休養生息，先謀得農村的復蘇，然後再進一步，共圖農村的繁榮。詎意共匪的叛亂，接踵而起，烽火所及，田舍為墟，造成今日中國農村支離破碎的現象，連糧食供應也成為嚴重問題。「民以食為天」，中國經濟的眞正危機，不在都市工商業的衰落，而在農村經濟的破產，友邦人士能注意及我國農村，在經濟上協助我國復興農村，實在是令人戚佩的。我們千萬不能錯過這個機會，務使這二千七百五十萬美元，個個均能用於農村，發揮其最大的效用。</p>
<p>凡是研究中國農村的學者，莫不認為：若欲挽救今日中國農村的危機，則非從士地改革與應用科學技術雙管齊下不可。司徒大使的照會，也指出中國農村復興聯合委員會的工作，除了「與中國政府諮商關於逐步實施各項土地改革措施之途徑及方法」而外，並「在若干省內選擇若干縣，創辦關於農業，家庭示範，衛生曁敎育之一配合而具有推廣性之計劃。凡屬農業生產，銷售，信用，灌溉，鄕村工業，營養？衛生，敎育，均包括在內」。由此可知，中美合作重建我厦農業，恰正適合我國農村的實際需要。但是在中美聯含委員會成立之際，我們仍要提出幾點意見，以供中美雙方的參攷：</p>
<p>第一，我國農村情形，從未有繁榮的一日，而且歷代實行改革，也從未能發生顯著的效果：時至今日，我們在美國經濟援助之下，共謀農村的復興，實在是千載一時的機會。大可利用此一機會，善用美援，推行農村全面建設之政策。我們相信，從復興農村着手，說不定，正是挽救中國經濟危機的上策，我們不可不特別重視，更不可不作縝密的計劃及永久的打算。</p>
<p>第二，美國重視中國農村復興，實為一種賢明的卓見，但是改革中國農業，必須將其重點，置於生產技術的改進，務使其於短期內達到增產的目的：故其所需資金浩大，決非區區二千七百五十萬美元所能濟事，美國旣願援助中國復興農村，根本解決中國的糧荒問題，自應擴大援助的範圍，以達成重建中國農村的任務。</p>
<h3>浙省推行土地改革　基本原則確定　由保障佃農利益着手</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州六日電〕浙省府決在不損害業主權益之原則下，推行溫和的土地改革，其具體辦法正由陳儀主席考慮審核中基本原則為（一）根據地租契約登記，澈底推行二五减租，保陣田農利益。（二）規定個人與團體所有土地之最高額，逾額土地概由政府征購，轉售予佃農。（三）不在地主之土地或其他荒地等，由佃農申請代購者，或不照政府規定土地施用法者，得由政府征購，轉售佃農。（四）由政府利用大量荒地，海塘·舉辦自耕合作農塲，供貧農佃農墾植。至於佃農向政府購產，可用分期付款方式，政府則用土地公債或其他方式籌措基金用以周轉。總之，由二五减租保障佃農利益着手，以最平和之手段，達成耕者有其田之目的，奠定農村經濟。此項辦法確定後，將先在情形優良而地籍整理著有成績之縣先行辦理。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕據消息靈通之外交方面五日稱，據目前之情勢，西方盟國如能將預定於九月一日築會制憲之西德國民議會，延遲或取消，則蘇聯可能解除柏林封鎖。蓋史達林在說明渠渴望和平之餘，曾明白表示渠極不願意西德政府之成立。雖然史達林並未說明如西方盟國延遲召開西德國民議會，則渠將解除柏林封鎖。但據悉西方使節已獲得此項影響，認為此係史達林希望西方政府採取之初步行動，俾四國間能達成較好之氣雾。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦六日電〕可靠方面報告：英美法三國使節二日晋謁口達林，展開東西交涉之新序幕，另一次克林姆宮會議可望於數小時內發生，然可能僅由西方使節與莫洛托夫談話。本週本週西方國家間之談判，乃又一次克林姆宮會講之先聲。據權威消息，該會議討論重心將為外長會議（討論德國問題）之地點，時間及議程。如克里姆林宮與西方協議再度召集四外長會議，則可望於今秋在巴黎舉行，而與九月廿一日開幕之聯合國大會相值，蓋四強屆時諒必由外長躬率代表團出席也。該會可與一九四六年廿一日間在紐約舉行之外長會議相埒，蓋是時亦值聯大開會，而對務國衛星國之和約草案亦即於該會議中通過。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦六日電〕據英權威方面透露：西方三強代表與蘇聯政府會商之公報，在三强代表再度與莫洛托夫會商後不久，即將於本週以內發表。該公報並將於莫斯科倫敦華盛頓及巴黎同時公佈之。</p>
<h3>蘇對西方國家讓步暗示　柏林局勢趨鬆弛　交還被告扣駁船同意外幣流通</h3>
<p>〔中央社柏林五日合衆電〕蘇方今會在柏林及佔領喊邊界地帶，對西方國家讓步，此似為彼等在柏林對西方國家緊施壓力以來，初次之和協表示。蘇方除交還西方國家彼等所扣留之十隻馭船外，且同意其他貨幣在柏林亦可自由流通。據悉，此一協定，乃柏林市財政官員與蘇聯主持下德國銀行會談後，所獲致者。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林五日電〕德民政當局與西方盟國頃已獲致一項重舉勝利，蓋蘇聯當局頃宣佈彼等將　暫時一將德人存儲於柏林蘇佔區銀行內之存款解凍，因而允許柏林西方國家佔區內各商業機關得以此償付債款。但英美經濟專家提出警吿，對蘇聯之放寬限制勿過分重視，英方發言人暗示，蘇聯之讓步或與莫斯科談判有連帶關係。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林六日電〕此間法軍發言人今晨否認蘇方ADN通訊社所發表之消息，謂柏林市法佔區之大多數半官人士及官員已離開柏林。</p>
<h3>制止通貨膨脹案　美衆院修正通過</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕衆院本日通過一項共和黨所主張之法案，其目的乃欲藉限制消費者之除賬與銀行之信用，以及提高聯邦準備銀行系統各銀行之黃金存額之辦法，以防止美國境內通貨膨脹之威脅。此項措置，係屬替代杜魯門總統所提包括七點之反通貨膨脹計劃者，結果以二百六十四票對九十七票獲得通過，刻已交參院審查。而參院中之共和黨領袖亦希望能迅速予以制定。此項共和黨所主張之辦法，並不包括政府所要求之有關物價配給與工資管制等規定，總統稱之為一種「不得力的妥協」。總統稱「目下第八十屆國會似已決心對本人為防止高物價以及保護美國一般公民使其不致受生活程度高漲之威脅而提出之建議，不擬採取有效行動」。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統本日向記者發表聲明稱，共和黨國會領袖已決定國會閉會，而並不予以機會，以使討論〔眞正有效」之反通貨膨脹措施。渠稱，「目下之情形，國會顯然並未完成余所以召開特別會議之任務，因此余希望共和黨領袖等將重新考慮其迅速閉會之計劃，而對於余所提之建議，採取行動」。</p>

<h3>美間諜案發現新證人　全案眞相即可大白　杜魯門指摘為共和黨之滑稽劇</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕杜書門總統五日讓剌國個之調查間謀案，為共和黨之低級趣味滑稽劇。但衆院非美活動委員會，則謂此舉幷非如此，且謂神秘之新證人不久將「剖明」全案。該委會代理主席蒙特脫談稱：渠已任命一特別小組委員會，各小組委員將離華府至仍未公布之城市，詢問姓名未公開之證人。</p>
<p>此人之姓名從未在調查共黨案內提及，迄今方知此人。此項奇特之聲明發表於該委員會舉行秘密會議之後。據蒙氏談稱：此一神秘證人，於此次秘密會議中，方由該委會之調查員首次加以公布。「吾人之調查員相信此人之證詞將引出另一證人，而二人之證詞將使此案眞相大白。」在此項聲明發表前數小時，杜魯門曾公開譏刺此案，渠稱；各調查委員會幷禾獲致已由聯邦調查局提交紐約聯邦大法官團以外之新證據或新證人。杜魯門指斥共和黨利用調查間諜案以掩飾共和黨之不能對反通貨膨脹計劃採取行動。但蒙特脫堅持該委會有理由可相信蘇聯間諜組織現仍工作於聯邦政府之內。另悉，時代雜誌編輯張伯斯宣誓謂：前國務院官員亞爾　·希斯，乃共黨地下組織問諜機構之人員。希斯五日在該委員會內完全否認此項控訴。</p>

<h3>蘇指揮亞洲共黨　發動決定性攻勢　必要時紅軍可立即採取行動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕美衆黨員周以德五日誦讀璣波格所撰一文，而將其列入國會議事錄內，該文警吿稱：共黨已發動亞洲方面之決定性攻勢。該文本載於「美國世界報導」二週期刋，略稱：「在越南·馬來亞·緬甸·泰國·以及中國本土，莫斯科專家給予地下軍隊在思想·情報·反間謀·政治戰略·經濟破壞，以及軍事戰略方面之各項訓令，俾於白人一旦退出已經覺悟之亞洲時，紅軍可有立即行動。」</p>
<p>周以拙指該文作者瑙波格為「極有資格與消息最靈通之人，消息來滬過及世界各地，在過去此項消息均證明正確非凡。」瑙氏在該文中有謂，越南·馬來亞·及喀什米爾之暴動，全屬莫斯科所主持之主要計劃之一部分。」紅軍戰略家，並正在亞洲中部與南部各地按月擴充情報網。蘇聯間諜組織之實力最吿擴大之時，在於蘇聯在曼谷設立公使館之際，該處蘇聯公使館在奈謙那公使之精悍領導下，擁有人員四十五人，均係特出之特務人員。渠並謂魏德邁將軍之報吿，曾預料共黨在亞洲之攻勢，「對蘇聯與密佈亞洲全境之當地共黨密切聯絡之蘇聯亞洲戰略，亦會加以地理上分析。」</p>

<h3>關於柏林事件的問答</h3>
<p>— 章石譯</p>
<p>下面的一篇關於柏林事件之問答文字，乃是從一九四八年七月十六日出版的「美國新聞與世界報告」中譯來的。我們看了這一席問答之後，對於目前鬧得全世界不安的柏林問題，就可以更進一步的明瞭。</p>
<p>問：蘇聯能否把英，美，法驅出柏林？</p>
<p>答：可以的，駐柏林的英美法三軍，祗有六千五百名，而駐在柏林四周的蘇聯軍隊，目前共有三十萬名。况且柏林距西德又有百哩之遙，所以如果情勢緊張，英美法是沒法久居的。同時，依實力言，蘇聯只要用武力，柏林極容易落入蘇聯掌握。</p>
<p>問：柏林事件會引起戰爭嗎？</p>
<p>答：不，蘇聯是不想用武力去控制柏林的。</p>
<p>問：蘇聯怎樣能够不用武力而得到柏林？</p>
<p>答：蘇聯想用封鎖柏林與西德間水陸交通的手段，使柏林城受它的控制。它的意思是以為杜絕了柏林的水陸交通之後，可以令英美法感到對柏林西區物資供應的困難而自動退出柏林。於是蘇聯才可以獨自主裁柏林政務</p>
<p>問：美國在柏林所持的是什麼？</p>
<p>答：柏林是以前德國强盛和統一時代的京城，這是衆心所歸的地方。所以蘇聯想利用這塊地方，使其為受蘇聯支配的共黨政府所在地，以便將來統，全德國。當英美法還留居在柏林的時候，這個共黨政府是不能建立起來，所以蘇聯為了要完成這個計劃，自然勢必先要把英美法三國勢力趕出柏林不可。</p>
<p>問：蘇聯與西方列强有過什麽關於柏林交通的約定嗎？</p>
<p>答：關於蘇聯的准許使西方列强運供應品進入柏林的約定，是沒有正式訂立過條約。美國方面所持的，是一九四五年六月中杜魯門總統曾致備忘錄給史達林，提及關於美國可以有鐵路公路和航空綫通柏林的權限，而當時史達林沒有反對。蘇聯雖不正式管制交通，但是它却有隨時限止與柏林通行的能力，假使它高興這樣行事的話。</p>
<p>問：蘇聯有封鎖柏林水陸交通的權力嗎？</p>
<p>答：依美國方面看，蘇聯是沒有權力封鎖柏林水陸交通的，在蘇聯方面言，除掉書面約文的規定之外，此外的理由是不存在的。因為旣然沒有書面約文規定蘇聯無封鎖柏林水陸交通的權力，所以蘇聯就以為它有封鎖柏林水陸交通的權力了。</p>
<p>問：關於柏林的條約，曾在何地訂立過？</p>
<p>答：關於柏林供應管制的約文，連極簡單的條約都沒有過。基本的條約，却曾在倫敦的European　AovisoryCommission裏訂立過，其時在一九四三年十二月。於一九四五年六月，在波茨坥，社魯門·史太林和邱吉爾舉行波茨坦會議的時候，他們都同意過各佔領當局在其佔區地帶，可以有使行最高權力的權利，此一會議的結果，却就使柏林變了蘇軍佔區中的孤島。</p>
<p>問：航空走廊是什麼一回事？</p>
<p>答：西德與柏林的航空走廊共有三條，各寬二十英里。一條是由英軍佔區通柏林，一條由美軍佔區通柏林，另一條由法軍佔區通柏林。關於航空走廊的事，是在一九四五年訂過條約的，英·美法飛機可以各自自由地在走廊中飛來飛去，並且用不到通知蘇軍的。但是蘇聯飛機却也有權利在各國的航空走廊中迴飛</p>
<p>問：柏林的需要，全由西方列强供應嗎？</p>
<p>答：不。蘇軍佔區中有人民一百七十萬人，其需要是由蘇方供應的。英·美·法三軍佔區中，共有人民二百萬人，其需要是由英·美·法三國供應的。</p>
<p>問：英·美·法能够以空運解決西柏林的物資供應嗎？</p>
<p>答：於短時期內，是可能的。現在西柏林物資的消耗量，侮日要六千噸，其中包括二千噸食物和二千噸煤斤。但是英·美·法的空運量，侮日只有二千噸，這數量相當於西柏林在每廿四小時內的食物消耗量·因為空運量是這樣少，所以目前英·美·法三國所運往柏林的物資，皆是些煤斤和其他比較重要的供應品。（上）</p>
<h3>猶太願與阿盟　舉行和平會議　請柬已請貝那多特轉交</h3>
<p>〔合衆社台拉維夫五日電〕以色列外長薛托克五日要求貝那多特與阿拉伯接洽舉行和平會議，此乃以色列外部舉行會議達三小時之後之結果。薛氏談稱，以色列政府顧參加圓桌會議，而試與阿拉伯獲致協議。按此為阿猶雙方中任何一方提議談判和平之第一次。在以色列外部舉行會議時猶人仍堅持彼等之要求，薛托克會後即離外部往訪貝那多特，渠要求貝氏「向交戰國方面轉遞請與以色列政府舉行會議之請柬」。貝氏對此項邀請，殊感詫異，但對薛氏之建議未加評述。</p>

<h3>參會公用小組臨時會議　對公用事業新價　參議員群起責難　意見四項待今日續商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會公用委員會，於昨日下午三時起，連續舉行會議四小時，審查費樹聲等七十人所建議之八月份各種公用事業價格，所漲過鉅，請召開臨時大會，商討如何核减，以輕市民負祖一案。出席潘議長。徐副議長。及參議員等六十餘人。吳市長及公用局趙局長·張副局長等均列席。召集人姜豪·徐學禹·在竹一任主席團。四小時中，各參議員不避溽著，踴躍發言，對新價羣起責難，最後決定審查意見四項如次：</p>
<p>（一）召開臨時大會，日期由議長決定。</p>
<p>（二）組織小組硏究會，根據各參議員提供意見，擬具具體意見，人選除公用組全體委員外，並請各參議員自由參加。</p>
<p>（三）禾決定具體辦法前，請市政府轉知各公司暫緩照新價收費。</p>
<p>（四）交通工具停照新價收費，請公用局暫行酌定價格收費。</p>
<p>以上三·四·兩項，應否函知市府，或待臨時大會決議後函知市府，送請議長核定。</p>
<p>此項審查意見，當經該會秘書處立即請示議長，經潘議長核定，上述三·四兩項審查意見，亦應經定期召集臨時大會通過後，方能送請市府辦理。由是在未經臨時大會討論前，三·四兩項，此時尙不能發生效力。</p>
<h3>吳市長說明　處理三原則</h3>
<p>昨日會議開始，首由吳市長報吿此次核准新價經過。略稱：市府決不袒護公用事業，始終係在顧全市民負祖及繼續維持各公司營業之目標下，求取兩全之合理價格。個人認為，處理當前公用事業之價格問題，不脫三原則：（一）准油煤先結匯一個月，並由國行墊款。（二）取價社會主義化，消耗量少者負祖輕，大者負祖重。（三）公用事業之五金及生活兩項指數，准照上月份加五成計算本月份新價。對處理公用事業價格，市府確已盡最大努力，惟仍望參會諸公有更好之建議。</p>
<p>繼由趙局長報告此項新價激漲原因，一為外匯政策改用結匯證明書辦法，二為各公司用戶繳費時間常有延緩情事，影響公司資金週轉。</p>
<h3>各參議員　紛紛發言</h3>
<p>旋原提案七十人代表邵永生致詞，略稱：參會並未指市政當局係公用事業之啦啦隊，惟為市民無法負担新價，致還斷水斷電，而受影饗之人數逐漸步增至佔全市市民總數百分之四十至五十時，中央是否仍將置諸不問不聞。故應請立即召開臨時大會，向中央痛切陳詞，促起中央注意，此事現已非屬地方性質，應速採有效措置。</p>
<p>費樹聲對此次新價，認為市政當局應負相當責任，渠列舉應行糾正者七點，促當局從速督責各公司改進。</p>
<p>此後嚴諤聲，張中原，周祥生，虞舜，陳培德，水祥雲，楊無生，姜懷素等，紛紛發表意見。。歸納重要意見。（一）外商在國內經營工礦企業，實無理由以美金作為計算若干會訂項目之標準。（二）以後調準價格，不妨按南京市參會動議，照戰前價格八折作為基數，再按逐月生活指數調整。（三）社會主義化價格，亦足影饗工商業之大用戶，卒造成工商業倒閉之嚴重後果。（四）各項附加稅是否可予核减。（五）自動調整公式計算基數之不可靠。</p>
<h3>議長發表意見　召開臨時大會　事前應加考慮</h3>
<p>旋潘議長亦發表意見，略稱：公用事業調整新價，揆厥燬結，仍在中央之是否負責，蓋：（一）在中央對整個經濟金融財政政策（特別指貨幣問題）未央定前，公用事業價格問題，勢將愈演愈烈。（二）公用事業價格之一再調整，市政當局，參會諸公，早知問題必來，三月間早向中央有所建議，惟遭束諸高閣，其間幸賴若干賢明長官從中奔波接洽借款，否則，新價之上漲，恐尙不止此數。參會三月六月間，均有常會，對中央建議良多，結果中央常打官話，參會信用不啻已打折扣。故此次如欲通過召開臨時大會，事前應切實硏究考慮。個人意見，認為今後公用事業調整價格，應從外匯上漲倍數及生活指數兩項平均，覓取妥切標準。又機關軍隊所欠呆帳，應即付淸，以輕市民負担。</p>
<p>最後吳市長建設三點：（一）公用事業各項進口物料之五成進口關稅，請予豁免或核减。（二）油煤外匯，一次先結一個月至三個月。（三）美援中有關各公用事業之配件，望能予供應。</p>
<p>該會公用委負會議，定今日下午三時，仍將在該會召集會議，對四項審查意見，繼續商討，參會秘書處昨已發出緊急通知。</p>
<h3>倉庫涉嫌物資十起　分別議定處理辦法　五單位經證明準予移動</h3>

<p>此外尙有一家囤積案，牽涉大陸銀行，嫌疑重大，決定再行調查。</p>
<p>至其餘業已呈報之三百餘家倉庫，因檢查表格尙未印就，下週始可開始管查。</p>

<p>海軍第一軍區司令部政工室主任李月林，於六日下午四時，假上海服務社代表總司令部舉行本市漁輸商業同業公會理監事招待會，李氏即席致詞，略謂海洋經濟之發展為國民經濟之一環，漁輪業之發展為海洋經濟發展之重要部門，且與海軍息息相關，本市漁輪業公會在我國首創成立為時雖短，建樹甚多，盼今後能與本軍密切聯繫，裨本軍能順利達成獲漁（淸剿海匪，禁止日侵漁漁船）與海上救護等任務，確保收國海權。繼由到會人士相繼對海軍與今後之聯繫配合提供意見，並推定雙方代表定期草擬聯繫辦法，呈總部核定實施。</p>
<h3>漁業界集議　驅除黃牛黨</h3>
<p>市漁會昨召集全體魚業有關單位，硏討魚貨交易秩序問題，席間除於交易方法硏究改善外，對黃牛黨之滲入魚業界，從事跳艙强買，殺價揀貨等不良舉動，以及毆打傷人等不法行為，詳細提出，一致表示願意通力合作，設法驅除。</p>
<h3>指數劇升不已　工廠岌岌可危　趙班斧盼工人勿事苛求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據社會局副局長趙班斧語記者稱：近來工人對指數及發薪日期之爭議，均係經濟性而非政治性的。惟指數若照如此情形增漲上去，若干工廠勢必因不勝負担而有倒閉危險，深望工人能體諒資方困難，勿過分苛求，以渡過此艱難時期云云。</p>
<h3>契稅起徵點提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市契稅起征點，決提高為五萬元，業經地政局提出昨日市政會議通過。</p>

<h3>澳門小姐號失事　空中大刼案內幕</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>〔本報廣州二日航訊〕來往港澳綫的「澳門小　」號客襪，七月十六日在澳門海面「失事」墮海，機師及搭客共二十七人，除搭客黃源（又名黃耀）一人獲救外，其餘廿六人均遇難，這消息早已有電訊及航訊在本報先後登載。但當時大家祗以為是普通飛機失事，不曾料到有其他內幕，後來因為那獨一生還的搭客黃源口供矛盾，形跡可疑，引起了澳門警察當局的注意。同時，一般人亦以當日天氣甚佳，而「澳門小姐」為變引擎水陸兩用機，肇事時僅在開行後幾分鐘，縱使機件損壞，亦可下降修理，不致沉入海中，所以大家就感覺這次失事原因離奇，再推想到這可能是一件空中刼案。而澳門警察廳長鮑立據，也就一方面從黃源身上追尋綫索，一方面打撈起的飛機殘骸，和遇難者的尸身上詳細撿驗，經過兩星期的努力，到現在已證實：這確是一件空前的飛機大刧案，這生還的搭客黃源就是刧匪之一，其中經過，含有無限布情，而澳門當局在短短兩週內破獲這曲折鉅案，更可說得上警探史上的奇跡。</p>
<p>「斗門人」　最為可疑</p>
<p>「澳門小姐」這次失事旣被懷疑為空中刧案，那匪徒自然也就在搭各之內，所以追究這個綫索，當然要從搭客中着手。當日的搭客的名單和身份：（一）黃源（即黃耀），（一）趙昌，（三）趙才，（四）趙一鳴，（五）林雲靄（和益行交際），（六）貨頌平（澳協豐行及港大三元酒家業主），（七）黃志達（混名受難保，市橋殷商）（八）吳壽文（可口可樂華南總經理），（九）吳壽文夫人，（十）李乙黎（廣州置業公司經理），（十一）黃小姐（李乙黎女友），（十二）方女士（港名敎授黎威林夫人），（以下為外籍褡客）（十三）史刁活（德士古火油公司副經理），（十四）史刁活夫人，（十五）何治文（德士古公司批發主任），（十六）至（十九）納爾遜夫婦及子女共四人，（十一）比利喇（葡商人），（二一）莫斯哥維（印度馬戯班經理），（二二）堪富利夫人（英籍），（二三）史蔑士夫人，及機師賈廉麻，助理機師麥塔夫，國泰航空公司客運視主任科士德，女侍應生達高士打等，共二十七人。</p>
<p>從這上列名單來看，在十二名華籍搭客中，後八名都是在港澳有實際居址和職業之士商，祗有顯四名在港澳均無地址，在購票時祗登記為「斗門人」，那末，這四名當然是最可疑的人物了，而且在某一個深夜，那唯一被救的黃源，給醫院裏的看管人窺見，他曾私自靜靜下床，企圖試步（其足已斷）。又於某深夜，他解去裹傷的綁帶，企圖自縊，後為看管人制止。他又曾託人帶音訊給他家裏，並要帶訊人將地址嚴守秘密。這些詭秘的行動，便引起了警方的注意，於是將他囚於別室，禁止與外人談話，一面嚴鞫其口供，一面再偵查其他三人的來歷。</p>
<p>四匪來歷　偵查清楚</p>
<p>經數日偵查的結果，警方已知道他們四人的來歷：</p>
<p>黃源—中山斗門人，日偽時代曾在中山坦洲鄉任偽警衛隊隊長，在澳門曾犯案。</p>
<p>趙昌—中山斗門人，為四匪中之「參謀人才」。</p>
<p>趙才—又名趙三才，赤坎人，原為農夫，後與無賴為伍。</p>
<p>趙一鳴—曾任飛機師，並在馬尼刺學習航空，為四匪中年齡最大之一人。</p>
<p>另外在打撈起的機骸一部份，經過專家檢騐，認定該機當時未有着火，亦無强烈爆炸痕跡，而在拾獲之機翼上，發現有一彈孔，並在撈起的客屍中，有一具發現子彈傷痕，證明子彈從胸部射入穿背部而出，而副機師麥塔夫屍首項下背上，也有四厘半的子彈傷孔，同時還抬獲三八左輪手槍彈売一枚。</p>
<p>於是，從這四人的來歷，加上這種種物證，證實了這種驚人的空中刦案，而且更不容那匪徒之一的黃源狡辯，他祗好從實招供，和盤托出他們行刦的陰謀。</p>
<p>行刧計劃　事先籌備</p>
<p>原來，他們行刦是早有計劃的預謀，在半個月前，即開始籌備，黃源曾為進行道事，甩去港幣三千元。他們搭該機往返港澳數次，藉明瞭該機內部裝置。準備將該機奪過手後，即由趙一鳴駕駛，至一預定地點降落，那裏預約了四艘漁船接應贓物，並搶刦後將乘客擄去勒贖，分贓計劃，亦已擬定為：登機之四匪，各佔一份，其餘四漁船，則共佔一份。到了七月十六日，他們便改換了西服，由一人一起購得十五·十六·十七·十八號四張機票，充作搭客登機。</p>
<p>躍登飛機　分佔四站</p>
<p>四匪即分佔四站，由趙才在第一站，接近正副機師位，趙昌及趙一鳴分立一三站，監視兩旁乘客及搜掠，貨源則站立總入口咸指揮一切。</p>
<p>發動之初，先由趙才用槍指嚇正副機師，當時正副機師係分座機頭之左右兩方，被指嚇後，不敢動彈，距知搭客中之德士古公司副經理史刁活，為一孔武有力之彪形大漢，見狀知為遇盜，遂起而向趙才襲聲，不意趙一鳴適在其後，亦出槍指嚇，但史刁活不受屈服，兩人遂發生爭執；其餘搭客，紛紛奔避，機身便左右顚簸，在紛亂中，正機師賈廉麻暗中取一鐵棒，擬反身向趙才擊去，趙即發槍向賈速放八響，賈氏旋被擊倒，該機即時失去控制，向下俯衝，副機師亦挽救不及，直向海面撞去。當時站在入口處之黃源見勢不佳，急忙取得座墊兩個，跳下海中，而其他廿六人，遂不幸隨機墜海慘死。後來這唯一被救生還的黃源，也就留給警方作為破獲這案的關鍵。</p>
<p>行刧目標　傳說紛紜</p>
<p>至於他們行刦的目標，現正傳說紛紜：有說他們是企圖擄刦富商黃頌平·黃志達二人，但後來查出該二黃購票，係在四匪之後，故此說似禾足信。而是日携現款最多之搭客，則為李乙黎。據其家人說：約有美金四千元，但渠是否即為匪行刦之主要目標，則尙未由警方證實。</p>
<p>現在，這空中刦案總算吿一段落，行兇之四匪，除黃源外，其他三人已斃命。現警方正緝捕參與接應該機之關係匪徒。香港民航處長　斯，和該機所屬的國泰航空公司經理狄根素，已偕同機械工程師二人由港赴澳門，會同警方對這案作進一步的硏究。這一生還的匪徒黃源，移交司法審訊後，全案便不離大白。</p>

<p>自由談阿彌陀佛！  平齋　　從無綫電收音機中聽到廣播新聞，說是市參議員趙君豪先生等六十幾位爲了反對公用事業漲價太高，請求召開市參議會臨時大會。不知怎樣，我忽然心血來潮，對公用局趙局長的健康關切起來了。雖說伏天漸過，立秋已在目前，天氣理應比較凉快，大家的身體也多少總可以比絞舒服一些—然而局長們的貴體，向例在舉行參議會的時候總要嬌弱一點，至少那個長得頗爲岐嶷的尊　就不免有些發痛。於是口吞散利痛，提筆上辭呈，結果無非是大家懇切挽留，而答覆質詢也就改爲書面。天下太平，貴恙告痊。　　時值非常，一切從簡。因病請辭旣己成爲開之不已的老唱片，那麼這一次就　了何如？一次二次，看客們或者還有叫好的興致；來得太多了，就見得寒傖。頭痛靈藥多得很，常常撒嬌是和大老爺的官運不大相宜的。　　從前有兩句俗語，叫做一笑駡由他笑駡，好官我自爲之。一冬烘先生以爲是挖苦做官的，其實不然冬烘先生是不通的。所謂「笑駡」，無非是老百姓的一點點「怨」氣。好官是理應不管老百姓的怨恨的，此之謂「任怨」。此外，外國大班的薪水却務必確保其月支美金數千元，且竟以黑市計算，因之高級職員月支法幣達數百億元之譜者，比比皆是。」這就叫做體恤商（外國的）艱，是爲「任勞」。　　越是這種時世，偏偏這種好官越多，誰說中國老百姓的福氣不好？　　阿彌陀佛！郁達夫的詩  陸丹林　　幾個月來，搜集得郁達夫的舊體詩，有一百多首，以年代說，最早的是民十三年，最後的是卅三年。達夫的詩，受黃仲則的作品影響很深，而他的辛酸似乎較仲則更甚。至他的才華縱橫，閱歷波折，家國身世的艱虞，更非仲則所能幾及。一般的人批評達夫，多是說他是感傷頹廢浪漫，却不知他在感傷悽麗之餘，還有他的悲憤慷慨之音，絃歌變徵，振作士氣的吟詠。如未必臨危艱一死，多因無奈顧橫波。「男兒只合沙塲死，豈爲淩烟閣上圖。　　　死何難仇未復，百身可贖我奚辭？」「堂堂國士盈朝野，不及樂家一女郎。」「三分天下二分亡，四海何人弔國殤？一「天意似將頒大任，微軀何厭忍飢寒？等句，言爲心聲，可見一斑。　　達夫努力新文學寫作的時候，正是新體詩風靡一時，他却着眼於舊體詩的寫作。他在一骸骨迷戀者的獨衙」有說：「……目下流行着新詩，果然很好。但是像我這樣懶惰無聊，又常想發牢騷的無能力者，性情最適宜的，還是舊詩。你弄到了五個字，或者七個字，就可以把牢騷發盡，多麼簡便啊！我記得前年生病的時候，有一詩給我女人說：「生死中年兩不堪，生非容易死非甘。劇憐病骨如秋鶴，猶吐靑絲學晚蠶一樣傷心悲命薄，幾人憤世作消談！何當放棹江湖去，淺水蘆花共結庵。」若用新詩來寫，怕非幾十行字不能說出呢。……「看此，便知道他所以寫舊體詩的原因。不過他是不喜歡詩的派別和詩選之類，說他們成見深，卉不出眞的藝術作品來。　　他在四十歲那年和趙龍文的詩，有：「但求飯飽牛衣暖，茍活人問再十年。」這詩是作於民國廿四年。事眞湊巧，日本降伏，他遇害了。計時恰爲十年，如果照迷信的人說來，這眞是詩讖了。　　他的「毀家誇」十九首，郭沫若說它是一絕唱」的之外，如釣毫題壁詩：「不是尊前愛惜身，佯狂難免假成眞。曾因酒醉鞭名馬，生怕多情累美人。劫數東南天作孹，鷄嗚風雨海揚塵。悲歌痛哭終何補，義士紛紛說帝秦。」懷揚州詩：「亂擲黃金買阿嬌，窮來吳市再吹簫；簫聲遠渡江淮去，吹到揚州廿四橋。」是用姜白石小紅低唱我吹簫的韻。詠西湖詩：「樓外樓頭雨似酥，淡裝西子比西湖；江山也要文人捧，堤柳而今尚姓蘇。一道些都是輕鬆的陶醉的膾炙人口的作品。　　外侮日亟，國事蜩螗，他過岳墳有感時事的詩：「北地小兒躭逸樂，南朝天子愛風流。權臣自欲成和議，金房何嘗要汴州！屠狗猶拼弦下命，將軍偏惜鏡中頭。饒他關外童男女，立馬吳山志未酬。一過義烏詩：「駱丞草檄氣堂堂，殺敵宗爺更激昂；別有風懷忘不得，夕陽紅樹照島傷。」斷句如：「中原代有英雄出，各苦生民數十年。」「只愁亡國後，營墓更無田。」「萬一國破家亡後，對花灑淚豈成詩！」「閨中日踝陰符讀，要使紅顏識楚囚。」「千秋論定陳同甫，氣壯調雄節較差一等，都是有所寄託的悲憤之音。　　至他的毀家詩，雖然是絕唱，因爲牽涉方面太複雜，而且一面之辭，不想贅說了。行善得「報」  史儀　　上海的公共汽車乘客擠，誰都想跳上車佔側座兒，舒舒服服坐到目的地。我今天兩隻手拿了三個包裏，自然更需要佔座，所以車子到站頭停住，我不等上面的乘客下車，就跳了上去。雖然挨買票的說了幾句不好聽的，我畢竟搶到一個座位。站上的人潮水一樣湧上來，把車廂擠得水洩不通，我看他們那種狼狽的神情，不禁顧而樂之。　　天下率往往樂極生悲，我正在爲自己高興的時候，一個女人忽然從人叢裏擠到我面前來了，因爲長得肥，氣喘得厲害，更糟糕的是她手裏還抱着一個不到三歲的妞兒，哭哭啼啼，像要吃奶的樣子。我看看坐在我旁邊的幾位，意思說「朋友，當仁不讓啊！」那知道我這個暗示却亳無反應。一位先生最定心，低着頭在看報，任那紐兒哭得震耳欲聲，他頭也懶得一抬。另一位穿短打的先生也是充耳不聞，頭朝外面看馬路。另外兩個中學生在談電影，因爲他們的談話無法順利進行，兩面孔討厭和鄙夷的神氣。我想：算了，活該是我到　！招呼一聲，把座位讓了給她。那個妞兒吮着奶，也不再吵了，兩個黑眼睛骨溜溜朝我看，我心裏罵了聲討厭。　　還好，我的「善舉」有人看到。有不少人在竊竊私語，說我的爲人好。聽到了這些，心裏覺得滿高興，雖則兩隻手拿了三個包裏，搖搖擺擺很吃力，恨不得把頭伸在籐圈裏吊起來，肚裏却不再嘰咕了。角洛裏，一個胸前掛着銀質的十字架的老頭兒嘮嘮叨叨地在對他的同伴迨敎，勸他多做好事，上帝自　　謝　　我的高興又給他這幾句話鼓勵了起來。我不是做了好事麼？上帝或許會帮我忙，讓我升級加薪，或者在路上拾到一大捆鈔票，或者……諸如此類的事情。我這樣胡思亂想，幾乎把站頭都錯過了，虧得買票人一聲喊，我連忙擠出去，跳下車子。　　回到家裘，妻子間我要薪水。我有心逗逗她，回說沒發，一面郤伸手到袋裏去，想拿出來交給她。她知道我哄她，看着我不作聲，郤攤着手。我摸了半天，摸出一張車票放在她手心裏，說：　　「今天的車十眞擠，你看我概得滿頭是汗，快給我一點水。薪水沒發下，明天準有，別急。」　　我現在還在盤算，明天怎樣向會計課的老仇商量，預借下個月的薪水。近詩二首  張一渠　　望渡　　妾在江南住，郎在江北戍；紅北真江南，可望不可渡。　　莊螺　索書惠詩次韻奉酬　　　　漫送鴉，生涯未足誇，拋磚引此玉，惱客鑑前車；僥倖詩爲友，依稀道有芽，靑燈解人意，盛放一繁花。仲夏夜之夢  羊仁　　忽聞物價普遍大跌，跌得與戰前完全一樣，上白米十一元一石，黃金每兩百元，最好的毛貨衣料，不過兩元左右一尺。我又驚喜，又懊悔，悔的是昨犬手頭剛有法幣一千萬，不應該買米買柴，念急化去，化得實在寃枉；喜的是所幸尚未用完，還剩二百萬元，如以買米，可得二十萬石，以買黃金，可得二萬兩，合大條子二千根，買其他日用品，更不必說了。我想，自今以後，雖不能當鉅富之稱，至少可算小康，心寬體胖，優哉遊哉！心中一樂，不覺笑出聲來。　　耳畔忽體得有人說：「有什麼窮開心！」　　睜眼定神，原來剛才是在夢中，床頭人聽得我笑，以爲夢覽，便來推醒。回味夢境，悠然而神往；環顧現實，爽然而若失；與妻語，相與啞然而失笑。　　但願好夢連宵，在罟難的人生中，總算也可得到片刻的樂趣。羅宋村  史郁　　我們這五個人，天生酷愛旅行。每年這個時候，總要到外面去接近一下自然。今年我們在很短的時問內，遍遊了嘉興·平湖·乍浦·杭州四地。煙雨樓別來無恙，平湖瓜則大不如昔。西子湖在香客的泛濫中，全無靈秀氣息。晚來泛舟湖上，束岸在唱「妹妹我愛你」，西岸在唱紹興高調，竭力「擺說」，只覺得船在搖動，並無飄然可言。到乍浦黃山時好比身入異域，使我大吃一驚，想着怎麼會走錯了路，走到外國去了！　　乍浦到黃山有兩條路可走：一條是公路，一條是沿海翻山越嶺而去。我們走的是山路，翻呀翻的要翻過六個山頭，可沒有看見一個鄕人，但見三三兩兩的碧眼兒，拿了烏槍在游目騁懷，看見了我們，好像倒不勝驚異的樣子。翻到了第五座山頭，暴風雨驟至，我們想到半山的那個新築成的別墅裏去躱一躱雨。還沒有走近，就有兩隻碩大的獵犬向我們狂吠而來。別墅裏一個羅宋男人搖手示意，叫我們「Backward」。兩個羅宋女人帶着微笑，在欣賞我們的狼狽。　　穿了濕透的雨衣翻到最後一個山頭時，雲層又顯得明朗起來。雨後的江南自有一翻柔潤而明媚的色澤，我們的一老平湖」徐君遙指着黃山脚下一叢叢的茅屋說：「那便是羅宋村了！」這個羅宋村眞是一個大好的所在：前面是海，後面是山，四百多間茅屋就建築在這長達半里的沙灘上。我們只看見兩個國人，其他便都是穿了各式游泳衣的碧眼兒。他們大都頭如栲栳，身大如槐，腰幹的粗，大腿的肥，足以使人昨舌。我們也脫了衣服，下得海中，拍出來的照片幾乎變成了五付「排骨」。海灘上最多肥胖的老婦招搖過市，最少年輕的小伙子。一般地講，大都是四十開外的。　　據鄉下人說：除星期日有一批上海人來「泡泡」海水外，平時是很少有國人來的。這裏除一個法國少校，兩個美國人及少數的猶太人外，便都是羅宋人的世界了。他們自成一個集團，天天有卡車集體運隔夜的麵包及廉價的麥其淋來。從他們的起居及衣着看來，「窮開心」的居多。那些茅屋是灰泥的牆，稻草的頂，竹竿的窗。倒是用大價錢向鄉下人租來的。黃山脚下租一個夏天要五担米一間，陳山脚下担米即可。羅宋村中也有一條霞飛路，幾家西班牙式的酒吧問，一偶混身黑膚的女郎帶着風情的淺笑在等待着客人。　　我們回乍浦是沿着黃山後面的公路走的。那邊就看不見一個碧眼的人。鄕下人說：「那是山陰，又沒有海！」鄉下人的話是對的。但「山陽」那些美麗的所在，却已變成了很多「羅宋村」了。有鼠來窺閣雜筆  禹壽　　「小型李鴻章」　　雜書坊中，有徐世昌博士所著皮郛燙金之書一冊，名「歐戰後之中國」，購而讀之，亦頗解頤。　　世昌在遜淸，以進士留館授編修，詩文皆未能出「館閣圈」，極言之，翰林中之通品而已，未嘗見其能爲洋洋灑灑之政論文字。此書獨標新格，居然爲「飲冰室式」的，首章暢論戰後世界之經濟變動，引三金戰爭與三M戰爭之說，且附綴英文名詞若干，摩登異常，大有老女炫嫁塗粉狼藉之槪。書出版於民國九年，世昌時猶未卸大任，不知是何名幕，爲主此稿，思之輒爲掩卷失笑。　　世昌雖爲袁項城所援引，屬於「小站系」人物，但其政治上之發跡，則始於光緒二十七年西后之召見，時合肥相國已死，西后見世昌風度端凝，應對得體，不覺歎曰：「抑何神似李鴻章乃爾！」即以此特殊之賞識，未幾，晋爲商部右丞，此世昌插足中樞政治之始，倘戯爲之諦，亦仍是靠臉子吃飯之類也。　　北府時代，袁黎馮徐曹五任總統，除世凱外，以世昌爲最有才，而卒以機智敗事，倘取與合肥李氏比，心算之灤殆微近之，而氣局終不逮也。　　世昌爲天津人，說者每謂天津近三百年來，有特俊之兩人可書，則費宮人與李叔同是，世昌與嚴修張伯苓皆不與焉。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Premier Weng's new economic and financial policies are still under careful consideration and will be gradually implemented in the future. It was previously rumored that the Executive Yuan would convene a temporary meeting on the 7th to discuss this proposal. It is now learned that the temporary meeting will not be held. However, this does not indicate that the authorities have halted the new plan; on the contrary, it is under careful consideration.</p>
<h3>Half of the U.S. Aid Economic Funds to Purchase Food and Cotton, Use of Construction Funds Still to Be Determined</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] It is reported that the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration has drafted a preliminary allocation plan for the economic portion of U.S. aid funds, amounting to US$275 million.

<p>We are Studying Concrete Implementation Measures</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] According to sources concerned, the government is currently studying concrete implementation measures for utilizing U.S. aid in coordination with self-help plans. Since former Executive Yuan Premier Zhang Qun announced the ten self-help plans, the United States has been closely monitoring the plans proposed by our country and has inquired about the progress of their implementation. Especially after the arrival of U.S. aid materials, the United States has expressed great interest in the implementation of our country's U.S. aid coordination with self-help plans, hoping that we will use U.S. aid to achieve self-reliance. At noon on the 6th, Premier Weng summoned Yan Jiagan at his residence to discuss the issue of utilizing U.S. aid in coordination with self-help plans at length. The U.S. Aid Utilization Committee will also discuss specific methods for implementing self-help plans with relevant agencies. According to related sources, our country has been actively implementing the ten self-help plans. Soon after Premier Weng formed his cabinet, he merged the direct tax and commodity tax departments of the Ministry of Finance. This is a financial reform that has not been completed in 13 years, and now it is being resolutely implemented, which is a testament to the government's determination to implement self-help plans and financial reforms.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to Visit China Next Month</h3>

<h3>Advocating for Special Relief Donations, Wang Yunwu Pledges One Billion</h3>
<p>To Be Paid After Selling Commercial Press Shares</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu recently voluntarily pledged to donate one billion yuan for special relief. On the 6th, he sent a letter to Shen Yi, chairman of the Beijing Special Relief Donation Collection Committee, stating: "The government is organizing a special relief donation, and I, as one of the responsible parties, should take the lead in advocating for it. Although I have served in the cultural and industrial and commercial circles for decades before entering politics, my assets, other than a rich collection of books, are very meager. In order to support this effort, I am reluctantly donating one billion national currency. I will sell a portion of all my Commercial Press shares in a few days, and the proceeds will be paid immediately. I respectfully report this in advance."</p>

<h3>Person in Charge of Reparations Committee</h3>
<p>Explains Price Allocation and Payment Method</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The person in charge of the Reparations Committee stated: The method for private enterprises to pay for Japanese reparations materials was originally stipulated to be calculated in U.S. dollars, but payment could be made in national currency at the Central Bank's posted market price. The current exchange settlement method has been changed to an exchange settlement certificate system. The original stipulated price is the sum of the Stabilization Fund price plus the exchange certificate price, which has been clearly explained by the Executive Yuan and notified to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Yesterday's report that the method for private enterprises to pay for reparations materials was calculated at a rate of 3,474,000 national currency to one U.S. dollar is inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Overseas Chinese in South Korea Establish Self-Governing Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Nearly 14,000 overseas Chinese in South Korea have recently promoted a self-governing organization similar to the Baojia system. According to the person in charge of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the commission only learned about this matter from newspapers and has not received an official report from the Consulate General in the area. However, under the control of the Japanese invaders, a toxic policy was implemented, with rampant smoking, gambling, and prostitution, and the overseas Chinese suffered deeply from it. Currently, North and South Korea are still occupied by the U.S. and Soviet armies, respectively, and the situation is complicated. Under the guidance of the Consulate General in Seoul and with the approval of the Korean authorities, it is necessary for the overseas Chinese in the area to promote this organization.</p>
<h3>Martial Law Declared in Shenyang</h3>

<h3>Tightening Siege Around Baoding; Guomindang Forces in Eastern Hebei Conduct Sweeping Operations in Multiple Routes; Shaanxi Troops Seize Hancheng in One Swift Strike</h3>

Guomindang forces are closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 6th] Reliable sources: The Guomindang forces in eastern Hebei are indeed conducting sweeping operations north of the Beining Railway line in multiple routes, aiming to annihilate the main force of the Communists. Since the objective is not to capture cities and seize land, they have not garrisoned the virtually empty cities of Fengrun, Qian’an, and Lulong. One unit of the Guomindang forces penetrated to Haoshutun, 18 kilometers northwest of Qian’an, on the 5th. Communist military uniform factories, shoe factories, and hand grenade factories located there were searched and thoroughly destroyed by the Guomindang forces.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>American Aid and Rural Reconstruction</h3>
<p>The China-United States Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction has been established with the agreement of both China and the United States through an exchange of notes. The personnel have also been finalized and the commission will be established shortly. We have repeatedly read Ambassador Stuart's note and Foreign Minister Wang's reply in their entirety and deeply understand the great significance of the United States' economic assistance to China for rural reconstruction, gradually improving the economy, education, and health. As Ambassador Stuart said, "I sincerely hope that scholars studying Chinese society and economic problems will regard this day (August 5th) as a milestone in the path towards sound improvement of the situation in rural areas of China."</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Aid Act, the portion of aid to China was originally $463 million, of which $125 million was for military aid and the remaining $338 million was for economic aid. Later, it was reduced to $400 million. Military aid remained unchanged, while economic aid was reduced to $275 million. Of this, nine-tenths will be used for emergency production and purchase of urgently needed food, cotton, chemical fertilizers, petroleum, and industrial equipment. The remaining one-tenth will be used for rural reconstruction in China. Because the former is of an emergency nature, only the rural reconstruction portion is for permanent construction purposes. Therefore, both China and the United States attach great importance to this matter. When the Chinese Economic Survey Group came east in early June to conduct on-site surveys and study construction plans, Dr. Merrill, an American agricultural expert, also came to investigate the agricultural and economic situation in China. The fact that China and the United States have agreed to establish the China-United States Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction shows that American assistance to China for rural reconstruction has moved from publicity and design to a concrete stage. All those who are concerned about the situation in rural China cannot but regard this as the most gratifying phenomenon at present.</p>
<p>China has historically been a country that "relies on agriculture." More than 80% of the country's population is farmers. Therefore, the adequacy or inadequacy of the people's food supply has often been the dividing line between order and chaos in Chinese history. However, in the past decade, the situation in rural China has deteriorated and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Before the War of Resistance, because farmers adhered to old ways and were self-enclosed, coupled with years of natural and man-made disasters, rural China had already declined. During the War of Resistance, the vast rural areas that fell under Japanese occupation were severely damaged and devastated by the enemy and their puppets. Even those that were fortunate enough not to be occupied by the enemy were increasingly depleted due to requisitioning of grain and conscription of soldiers. After the victory, it was possible to recuperate and first seek the recovery of the countryside, and then further work together to seek rural prosperity. Unexpectedly, the communist rebellion arose one after another. Where the flames of war reached, fields and houses were turned into ruins, creating the fragmented phenomenon of rural China today. Even the food supply has become a serious problem. "The people regard food as their heaven." The real crisis of the Chinese economy lies not in the decline of urban industry and commerce, but in the bankruptcy of the rural economy. It is truly admirable that foreign friends can pay attention to our country's rural areas and assist us economically in rural reconstruction. We must not miss this opportunity and ensure that these $27.5 million are used in the countryside to maximize their effectiveness.</p>
<p>All scholars who study rural China believe that if we want to save the crisis in rural China today, we must adopt a two-pronged approach of land reform and the application of scientific and technological knowledge. Ambassador Stuart's note also points out that the work of the China-United States Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, in addition to "consulting with the Chinese government on ways and means of gradually implementing various land reform measures," will also "select a number of counties in some provinces to create a coordinated and extensible plan for agriculture, family demonstration, health, and education. All aspects of agricultural production, sales, credit, irrigation, rural industry, nutrition, health, and education are included." From this, it can be seen that Sino-American cooperation in rebuilding our country's agriculture is precisely suited to the actual needs of rural China. However, on the occasion of the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission, we would like to offer a few suggestions for the reference of both China and the United States:</p>
<p>First, the rural situation in our country has never been prosperous, and reforms in the past have never had a significant effect. Today, with American economic assistance, we are working together to revitalize the countryside, which is truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. We can take advantage of this opportunity, make good use of American aid, and promote a policy of comprehensive rural construction. We believe that starting with the revitalization of the countryside may be the best way to save the Chinese economic crisis. We must pay special attention to this and make thorough plans and permanent arrangements.</p>
<p>Second, the United States' emphasis on rural reconstruction in China is a wise and insightful vision, but reforming Chinese agriculture must focus on improving production technology so that it can achieve the goal of increased production in the short term. Therefore, the funds required are huge, and certainly not something that a mere $27.5 million can solve. Since the United States is willing to assist China in rural reconstruction and fundamentally solve China's food shortage problem, it should expand the scope of assistance to achieve the task of rebuilding rural China.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province to Implement Land Reform; Basic Principles Confirmed; Starting with Protecting the Interests of Tenant Farmers</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 6th] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to promote moderate land reform under the principle of not harming the rights and interests of landlords. The specific measures are being considered and reviewed by Chairman Chen Yi. The basic principles are: (1) Thoroughly implement the "25% rent reduction" based on land lease registration to ensure the interests of tenant farmers. (2) Stipulate the maximum amount of land owned by individuals and organizations. Land exceeding the limit will be purchased by the government and resold to tenant farmers. (3) Land not owned by landlords or other wasteland, etc., may be purchased by the government and resold to tenant farmers if tenant farmers apply for purchase on their behalf or if the land is not used in accordance with government regulations. (4) The government will use a large amount of wasteland and seawalls to establish self-cultivating cooperative farms for poor farmers and tenant farmers to cultivate. As for tenant farmers purchasing property from the government, they can use installment payment methods. The government will use land bonds or other methods to raise funds for circulation. In short, starting with the "25% rent reduction" to protect the interests of tenant farmers, the goal of "land to the tiller" will be achieved through the most peaceful means, laying the foundation for the rural economy. After these measures are finalized, they will be implemented first in counties with excellent conditions and achievements in land registration.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Demonstration Zone</h3>
<p>Ministry of Agriculture is actively preparing in Zhejiang; Implementation to begin in Hangzhou and other ten counties and cities.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 6th] In order to prepare for the establishment of a Zhejiang agricultural extension demonstration province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry sent Vice Minister Zhou Chang and Dr. Linimu of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and Commissioner Wang Xixian to Hangzhou. A preparatory meeting was held on the 6th, and it was decided that the 25-county demonstration zone would be implemented first in Hangzhou City, Hangzhou County, Yuhang, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Jinhua, Lanxi, and Quzhou. The approved budget is 133.877 billion yuan. The Agricultural Extension Committee will be established soon, with an Extension Supervision Office under it.</p>
<h3>Limiting Private Farmland; Jiangxi Province Begins Preparations</h3>
<p>Implementation awaits the provincial government's decision.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 6th] Jiangxi Province has begun preparations for limiting the area of privately owned farmland since last month. The official implementation date will await the final decision of the provincial government. Local people believe that this work is an important step in implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood and equalizing land ownership. According to highly reliable sources: The maximum limit for the area of privately owned farmland per person will be based on the following regulations: (1) The paddy field per household shall not exceed 50 mu of upper-grade, 75 mu of middle-grade, or 100 mu of lower-grade. (2) The dry land shall be double the amount of upper, middle, and lower-grade paddy fields. (3) Those who own both paddy and dry land (excluding workers) and have more than ten family members may increase the amount proportionally. From the date of promulgation of these measures, all those whose privately owned farmland exceeds the limit shall be required to sell the excess farmland within three years. If the deadline is exceeded, the municipal and county governments may request the provincial government to confiscate the land in accordance with the law and allocate it to self-cultivating farmers. The compensation land price for the confiscation may be accompanied by land bonds, which will be paid off in five years.</p>
<h3>Gu Fengxiang Visits Wei Lihuang</h3>

<h3>Lanzhou Central Hospital uses Radium for Treatment for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Lanzhou, 5th] A set of radium needles donated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to the Lanzhou Central Hospital, weighing a quarter of a gram and worth about 100 billion yuan, has been put to use. Under the guidance of Xu Xianming, the president of the Dihua Central Hospital, who recently returned from the United States, radium needles were used for the first time in Lanzhou to treat a patient with uterine cancer. This is still an innovation in medical care in the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Gansu Province has Too Many Prisoners; Exceeding Prison Capacity</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Lanzhou, 6th] Judicial sources report that the prisons in Gansu Province have a capacity of 3,780 inmates, but there are currently 5,369 inmates, exceeding the capacity by 1,589. They consume 17 billion yuan worth of prisoner food per month, and the problem of production needs to be solved urgently.</p>
<h3>Gansu Provincial Government Plans to Conduct a Survey of Wealthy Households Throughout the Province</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Lanzhou, 6th] The Gansu Provincial Government recently plans to conduct a survey of wealthy households throughout the province, with those who have more than 1,000 mu of land and more than 100 billion yuan of property as the highest standard, and those who have more than 300 mu of land and more than 30 billion yuan of property as the lowest standard. The survey methods are being carefully studied. It is reported that if there are difficulties in conducting the survey, a general meeting of the people will be held to elect them publicly.</p>
<h3>Merchants Transporting Money to Xiamen Return to Shanghai on the Same Plane; Civil Aviation Team Privately Flies to Xiamen; Violates Contract Regulations; China Aviation and other Airlines Protest to the Civil Aviation Bureau</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 6th] Three merchants who privately transported money to Xiamen from Shanghai by special plane on the 4th in an attempt to buy black market foreign exchange returned to Shanghai on the same plane today. They came to Xiamen on the 4th with the money bundled into 48 pieces of luggage. The Xiamen Customs intended to detain them because more than 15 kilograms were carried by 28 people, but the Shanghai merchants argued that the plane had been inspected and released by the Jianghai Customs before taking off in Shanghai, and the Xiamen Customs had no reason to detain them. They argued at the Xiamen airport for five hours. Finally, the Xiamen Customs transported all the money to the Central Bank in the city for temporary storage. On the 5th, the merchants requested that 15 kilograms be returned to each person, and the remaining amount was also carried back to Shanghai by the same plane today and handed over to the General Office of the Customs Service for handling. It is reported that the special plane was contracted by a certain travel agency in Shanghai and resold to various merchants. The round-trip ticket price was 1 billion yuan per ticket. However, it is puzzling that the plane flew back to Shanghai after arriving in Xiamen from Shanghai on the 4th, and then flew from Shanghai to Xiamen this morning to carry the merchants back to Shanghai. All parties believe that this is a large-scale organized activity. As for the exact amount of money carried, it is not possible to know because the customs and the central bank have not sealed it, but it is estimated to be about 600 billion yuan.</p>
<p>[Report] Chennault's Civil Air Transport (CAT) plane was chartered to transport 600 billion yuan in cash to Xiamen from Shanghai by merchants. Upon arrival in Xiamen, the money was found and detained by customs. It is learned that the contract between CAT and the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) stipulates that the flight route does not include the Shanghai-Xiamen line. The fact that CAT has privately flown on this route clearly harms the business of regular airlines. It is heard that China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and other companies have formally protested to the CAA yesterday, requesting that it be stopped quickly.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Tycoon Li Yuanda's Assets Disclosed; Seventy Refugees Sent for Foster Care</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 6th] The Wuhan Special Donation Solicitation Committee, in view of the fact that a few large households are still refusing to pay donations, has specially announced the assets of tycoon Li Yuanda, requesting public opinion to sanction him, and will send 70 refugees to his residence for foster care.</p>
<h3>Prices Soar in Baoding and Jinan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Baoding, 6th] Prices in Baoding are soaring madly. On the 5th, ordinary flour exceeded 30 million yuan per bag, gold hit 700 million yuan, and Shanghai Coffee brand cigarettes were 10 million yuan per carton. Prices of various goods have doubled in the past two days, and the market is in chaos. The main reason is that the Ping-Bao highway has been interrupted for nearly a month, and there is still no hope of restoration. In addition, there are no flights from Ping-Bao, the surrounding area is tense, and the source of food and goods is cut off. The future still looks bullish. The local authorities have not yet taken measures to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 6th] Prices in Jinan are rising madly. On the 6th, the first-class flour rose to 19.5 million yuan per bag, 20-count local yarn was 1.4 billion yuan per piece, and the black market price of gold broke 500 million yuan, reaching 500.2 million yuan per liang.</p>

<h3>Three Special Envoys Revisit the Kremlin for Talks with Molotov Agreement Reached on Convening a Four-Power Conference Rumors of Soviet Demand for Co-Management of the Ruhr</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 6th - Moscow Broadcast: The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France went to the Kremlin at 5:00 PM today for talks with Molotov. Agreement has been reached on convening a four-power conference to discuss the German question.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 6th - Broadcast: US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, French Ambassador to the Soviet Union 台岳, and Bevin's Secretary Roberts went to the Kremlin at 5:00 PM on the 6th to resume negotiations on the German question with senior Soviet officials. They hope to meet with Molotov. It is expected that the negotiations between the East and West blocs will end this weekend. The Western countries have held several meetings in Moscow and seem to have reached an agreement on the proposals to be submitted during the next visit to the Kremlin, but the details of the meeting are kept strictly secret and cannot be ascertained. It is reported that Stalin has requested to obtain speaking rights in the control of the Ruhr region as the price for lifting the Berlin blockade. After the Soviet Union participates in the control of the Ruhr region, it can obtain veto power over the policies of steel mills and other industrial productions, so as to contain the implementation of the US aid to Europe plan, so it is bound to be fought for.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] According to well-informed diplomatic sources on the 5th, if the Western Allies can delay or cancel the West German National Assembly, which is scheduled to convene a constitutional assembly on September 1, the Soviet Union may lift the Berlin blockade. Stalin, in explaining his desire for peace, clearly stated that he was extremely unwilling to establish a West German government. Although Stalin did not state that he would lift the Berlin blockade if the Western Allies delayed the convening of the West German National Assembly, it is understood that the Western envoys have gained this impression and believe that this is a preliminary action that Stalin hopes the Western governments will take so that a better atmosphere can be reached between the four countries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 6th] Reliable sources report: The envoys of the United States, Britain, and France paid a visit to Stalin on the 2nd, opening a new prelude to East-West negotiations. Another Kremlin meeting is expected to take place within a few hours, but it may only be a conversation between the Western envoys and Molotov. The focus of the discussions at the negotiations between Western countries this week will be the location, time, and agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference (to discuss the German question). If the Kremlin and the West agree to reconvene the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, it is expected to be held in Paris this autumn, coinciding with the opening of the United Nations General Assembly on September 21, as the four powers will certainly be led by their foreign ministers to attend the delegation. This conference can be compared to the Foreign Ministers' Conference held in New York between 1946 and the 21st, as the UN General Assembly was also held at that time, and the draft treaties with the enemy satellite countries were also passed at that conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] According to British authoritative sources, the communiqué of the Western Three Powers' representatives' consultations with the Soviet government will be released within this week shortly after the Three Powers' representatives consult with Molotov again. The communiqué will also be announced simultaneously in Moscow, London, Washington, and Paris.</p>
<h3>Soviet Implies Concessions to Western Countries The Situation in Berlin Tends to Ease Return of Detained Barges and Agreement on Foreign Currency Circulation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th, Associated Press] Today, the Soviet side made concessions to the Western countries in Berlin and the occupied border areas, which seems to be the first expression of conciliation since they tightened their pressure on the Western countries in Berlin. In addition to returning ten barges detained by the Western countries, the Soviet side also agreed that other currencies can also be freely circulated in Berlin. It is reported that this agreement was reached after a meeting between Berlin municipal financial officials and the German bank under the auspices of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 5th] German civil authorities and the Western Allies have recently achieved a major victory, as the Soviet authorities have recently announced that they will temporarily unfreeze the deposits of Germans stored in banks in the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, thus allowing commercial institutions in the Western countries' occupied zones of Berlin to use this to repay debts. However, British and American economic experts have issued warnings not to attach too much importance to the Soviet Union's relaxation of restrictions. A British spokesman hinted that the Soviet Union's concessions may be related to the Moscow negotiations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 6th] A French military spokesman here denied this morning the news released by the Soviet ADN news agency that most of the semi-official figures and officials in the French-occupied zone of Berlin have left Berlin.</p>
<h3>US House Passes Amended Bill to Curb Inflation</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] The House of Representatives today passed a bill advocated by the Republican Party, the purpose of which is to prevent the threat of inflation in the United States by restricting consumer credit and bank credit, and increasing the gold reserves of banks in the Federal Reserve System. This measure is a substitute for President Truman's seven-point anti-inflation plan, and was passed by a vote of 264 to 97, and has now been submitted to the Senate for consideration. The Republican leaders in the Senate also hope to enact it quickly. The measures advocated by the Republican Party do not include the regulations on price rationing and wage controls requested by the government, which the President called an "ineffective compromise." The President said, "At present, the Eightieth Congress seems to have decided not to take effective action on the suggestions I have made to prevent high prices and to protect the general public of the United States from being threatened by rising living standards."</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] President Truman issued a statement to reporters today, saying that the Republican Congressional leaders have decided to close Congress without giving it the opportunity to discuss [truly effective" anti-inflation measures. He said, "In the current situation, Congress has clearly not completed the task for which I convened the special session, so I hope that the Republican leaders will reconsider their plan to close quickly and take action on my suggestions."</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Calls for Struggle to Defend Freedom</h3>

King has presided over the national Liberal Party for three years, and now he is speaking out loudly at the party congress, drawing a dividing line between democracy and totalitarian communism. He said that he was speaking to party members in his capacity as Prime Minister and party leader for the last time. He said that communism is "the greatest threat of modern times," so the "highest task" of freedomism is to stop the growth of totalitarianism "and to combat the threat of communism." He also said that the trend towards the extreme and the most serious world problems, and that trend will remain dangerous for some time.</p>

<h3>New Witnesses Discovered in US Espionage Case The Truth of the Entire Case Can Be Revealed Truman Criticizes as a Republican Farce</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman on the 5th allowed the investigation of espionage cases, a low-taste farce by the Republican Party. However, the House Un-American Activities Committee said that this was not the case, and said that a mysterious new witness will soon "reveal" the entire case. Montrell, the acting chairman of the committee, said: He has appointed a special subcommittee, and the members of each subcommittee will leave Washington to an undisclosed city to question witnesses whose names have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>This person's name has never been mentioned in the investigation of communist cases, and it is only now that this person is known. This strange statement was issued after the committee held a closed-door meeting. According to Montrell, this mysterious witness was first announced by the committee's investigators at this closed-door meeting. "Our investigators believe that this person's testimony will lead to another witness, and the testimony of the two people will reveal the truth of the case." Hours before this statement was issued, Truman publicly ridiculed the case, saying; The investigating committees have not obtained any new evidence or new witnesses other than those submitted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the New York Federal Grand Jury. Truman accused the Republican Party of using the investigation of espionage cases to cover up the Republican Party's inability to take action on the anti-inflation plan. However, Montrell insisted that the committee had reason to believe that the Soviet spy organization was still working within the federal government. It is also learned that Time magazine editor Chambers swore that former State Department official Alger Hiss was a member of the communist underground spy organization. Hiss completely denied the allegations in the committee on the 5th.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] US Congressman Zhou Yide read an article written by 璣波格 on the 5th and included it in the Congressional Record. The article warned that the Communist Party has launched a decisive offensive in Asia. The text was published in the "American World Report" bi-weekly magazine, stating: "In Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, Thailand, and the mainland of China, Moscow experts provide underground troops with various instructions in ideology, intelligence, counter-espionage, political strategy, economic sabotage, and military strategy, so that the Red Army can take immediate action once the white people withdraw from the awakened Asia."</p>

Red Army strategists are also expanding their intelligence network in central and southern Asia on a monthly basis. The strength of the Soviet spy organization was most greatly expanded when the Soviet Union established a legation in Bangkok. The Soviet legation in Bangkok, under the strong leadership of Minister奈謙那, has 45 personnel, all of whom are outstanding special agents.

<h3>Questions and Answers about the Berlin Incident</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Shi</p>
<p>The following questions and answers about the Berlin incident are translated from the "U.S. News &amp; World Report" published on July 16, 1948. After reading this set of questions and answers, we can have a clearer understanding of the Berlin issue that is currently disturbing the whole world.</p>
<p>Q: Can the Soviet Union drive the British, American, and French out of Berlin?</p>
<p>A: Yes. The British, American, and French forces stationed in Berlin number only 6,500, while the Soviet troops stationed around Berlin currently total 300,000. Moreover, Berlin is a hundred miles away from West Germany, so if the situation becomes tense, the British, American, and French will not be able to stay for long. At the same time, in terms of strength, as long as the Soviet Union uses force, Berlin can easily fall into Soviet hands.</p>
<p>Q: Will the Berlin incident lead to war?</p>
<p>A: No, the Soviet Union does not want to control Berlin by force.</p>
<p>Q: How can the Soviet Union get Berlin without using force?</p>
<p>A: The Soviet Union wants to use the means of blockading land and water transportation between Berlin and West Germany to bring Berlin under its control. It believes that after cutting off Berlin's land and water transportation, it can make the British, American, and French feel the difficulty of supplying materials to the western district of Berlin and automatically withdraw from Berlin. Then the Soviet Union can independently decide Berlin's political affairs.</p>
<p>Q: What does the United States hold in Berlin?</p>
<p>A: Berlin was the capital of Germany in the era of its strength and unity, and it is a place to which the hearts of the people turn. Therefore, the Soviet Union wants to use this place as the seat of a communist government under Soviet control, so as to unify the whole of Germany in the future. When the British, American, and French are still in Berlin, this communist government cannot be established, so in order to complete this plan, the Soviet Union will naturally have to drive the forces of the British, American, and French three countries out of Berlin first.</p>
<p>Q: What agreements have the Soviet Union and the Western powers had regarding Berlin's transportation?</p>
<p>A: There is no formally established treaty regarding the Soviet Union's permission for the Western powers to transport supplies into Berlin. What the United States holds is a memorandum that President Truman sent to Stalin in mid-June 1945, mentioning that the United States could have the right to railway, highway, and air lines to Berlin, and Stalin did not object at that time. Although the Soviet Union does not formally regulate transportation, it has the ability to restrict passage to and from Berlin at any time, if it pleases to do so.</p>
<p>Q: Does the Soviet Union have the power to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation?</p>
<p>A: According to the United States, the Soviet Union has no right to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation. In the Soviet Union's view, apart from the provisions of written agreements, there are no other reasons. Because there is no written agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union has no right to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation, the Soviet Union believes that it has the power to blockade Berlin's land and water transportation.</p>
<p>Q: Where were the treaties regarding Berlin concluded?</p>
<p>A: There were no even simple treaties regarding Berlin supply controls. The basic treaty, however, was concluded in the European Advisory Commission in London, at that time in December 1943. In June 1945, at the Potsdam Conference held in Potsdam by Truman, Stalin, and Churchill, they all agreed that each occupying authority could have the right to exercise supreme power in its occupied zone. The result of this conference, however, turned Berlin into an island in the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<p>Q: What is the matter with the air corridors?</p>
<p>A: There are three air corridors between West Germany and Berlin, each 20 miles wide. One is from the British occupation zone to Berlin, one is from the American occupation zone to Berlin, and the other is from the French occupation zone to Berlin. The matter of the air corridors was stipulated in a treaty in 1945. British, American, and French aircraft can freely fly back and forth in the corridors, and do not need to notify the Soviet army. However, Soviet aircraft also have the right to fly back and forth in the air corridors of various countries.</p>
<p>Q: Are Berlin's needs entirely supplied by the Western powers?</p>
<p>A: No. The Soviet occupation zone has a population of 1.7 million, whose needs are supplied by the Soviet side. The British, American, and French occupation zones have a total population of 2 million, whose needs are supplied by the British, American, and French countries.</p>
<p>Q: Can the British, American, and French solve the supply of materials to West Berlin by airlift?</p>
<p>A: In the short term, it is possible. The current consumption of materials in West Berlin is 6,000 tons per day, including 2,000 tons of food and 2,000 tons of coal. However, the airlift volume of the British, American, and French is only 2,000 tons per day, which is equivalent to the food consumption of West Berlin in every 24 hours. Because the airlift volume is so small, the materials currently transported to Berlin by the British, American, and French three countries are all coal and other more important supplies. (Above)</p>
<h3>Jewish People Willing to Hold Peace Conference with Arab League Invitation Card Already Requested to be Forwarded by Bernadotte</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 5th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok requested Bernadotte on the 5th to contact the Arabs to hold a peace conference. This was the result of a three-hour meeting held by the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Mr. Shertok stated that the Israeli government is considering participating in a roundtable conference and trying to reach an agreement with the Arabs. This is the first time that either side of the Arab-Jewish parties has proposed negotiating peace. When the Israeli Foreign Ministry held a meeting, the Jews still insisted on their demands. After the meeting, Mr. Shertok left the Foreign Ministry to visit Bernadotte, and he asked Mr. Bernadotte to "forward the invitation to the Israeli government to hold a meeting to the warring parties." Mr. Bernadotte was quite surprised by this invitation, but did not comment on Mr. Shertok's proposal.</p>

<h3>Attending the Temporary Meeting of the Public Utilities Group Senators Criticize New Prices for Public Utilities The Four Opinions Await Further Discussion Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee held a continuous meeting for four hours starting at 3:00 PM yesterday to review the excessively large price increases for various public utilities in August, as suggested by Fei Shusheng and 70 others. Please convene a temporary meeting to discuss how to reduce the price increases to ease the burden on the citizens. Speaker Pan attended, as did Deputy Speaker Xu, and more than 60 senators. Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, Deputy Director Zhang, and others were also present. Conveners Jiang Hao and Xu Xueyu served as the presidium. During the four hours, the senators spoke enthusiastically despite the heat, criticizing the new prices. Finally, it was decided that the review opinions were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Convene a temporary meeting, the date of which will be decided by the speaker.</p>
<p>(2) Organize a research group, based on the opinions provided by the senators, to propose concrete opinions. In addition to all members of the Public Utilities Group, senators are invited to participate freely.</p>
<p>(3) Before a concrete plan is decided, please ask the municipal government to inform the companies to temporarily postpone charging the new prices.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation should stop charging the new prices, and the Public Utilities Bureau should temporarily determine the prices to be charged.</p>
<p>Whether the above items 3 and 4 should be communicated to the municipal government by letter, or whether they should be communicated to the municipal government after being resolved at a temporary meeting, should be submitted to the speaker for approval.</p>
<p>The secretariat of the committee immediately requested instructions from the speaker regarding this review opinion. After Speaker Pan approved it, the review opinions in items 3 and 4 above should also be submitted to the municipal government for handling after being passed by a regularly convened temporary meeting. Therefore, before being discussed by a temporary meeting, items 3 and 4 cannot take effect at this time.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Explains The Three Principles of Handling</h3>
<p>At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, Mayor Wu first reported on the process of approving the new prices. He stated that the municipal government will never protect public utilities, and has always been seeking a reasonable price that takes into account both the burden on citizens and the continued maintenance of the companies' operations. He personally believes that the handling of the current price issues of public utilities cannot escape three principles: (1) Allow oil and coal to be settled in foreign exchange one month in advance, and have the national bank advance funds. (2) Adopt socialist pricing, with lighter burdens for those who consume less and heavier burdens for those who consume more. (3) The five gold and livelihood indexes of public utilities are allowed to calculate the new prices for this month based on the previous month plus 50%. The municipal government has indeed made its best efforts to handle the prices of public utilities, but it still hopes that the senators will have better suggestions.</p>
<p>Director Zhao then reported on the reasons for the sharp rise in new prices, one of which was that the foreign exchange policy was changed to use foreign exchange settlement certificates, and the second was that the companies' users often delayed paying fees, which affected the companies' capital turnover.</p>
<h3>Senators Speak Up</h3>
<p>Then Shao Yongsheng, the representative of the 70 original proposers, delivered a speech, stating that the senators did not mean to say that the municipal government was a cheerleader for public utilities, but that when citizens were unable to afford the new prices, resulting in the cutting off of water and electricity, and the number of people affected gradually increased to 40% to 50% of the total number of citizens in the city, would the central government still turn a blind eye and deaf ear? Therefore, a temporary meeting should be convened immediately to make a heartfelt statement to the central government, urging the central government to pay attention. This matter is no longer of a local nature and effective measures should be taken quickly.</p>
<p>Fei Shusheng believed that the municipal government should bear considerable responsibility for this new price increase. He listed seven points that should be corrected and urged the authorities to supervise and urge the companies to improve as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After that, Yan Esheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhou Xiangsheng, Yu Shun, Chen Peide, Shui Xiangyun, Yang Wusheng, Jiang Haisu, etc. expressed their opinions one after another. The important opinions can be summarized as follows: (1) Foreign businessmen operating industrial and mining enterprises in China have no reason to use US dollars as the standard for calculating certain treaty items. (2) In the future, when adjusting prices, it may be possible to follow the motion of the Nanjing Municipal Council and use 80% of the pre-war price as the base, and then adjust according to the monthly cost of living index. (3) Socialist pricing is also sufficient to affect large industrial and commercial users, eventually leading to the serious consequences of industrial and commercial bankruptcies. (4) Whether various surcharges can be reduced. (5) The unreliability of the calculation base of the automatic adjustment formula.</p>
<h3>The Speaker Expresses His Opinion The Convening of a Temporary Meeting Should Be Considered in Advance</h3>
<p>Then Speaker Pan also expressed his opinion, stating that the adjustment of new prices for public utilities still lies in whether the central government is responsible, because: (1) Before the central government has finalized the entire economic, financial, and fiscal policy (especially the monetary issue), the price issue of public utilities will inevitably become more and more intense. (2) The municipal government and the senators have long known that the issue of repeated adjustments in the prices of public utilities would come. In March, they made suggestions to the central government, but they were unfortunately shelved. Fortunately, some wise officials ran around to negotiate loans, otherwise, the price increase would have been even greater. The council had regular meetings in March and June, and made many suggestions to the central government, but the central government often gave official answers, and the council's credibility had already been discounted. Therefore, if a temporary meeting is to be convened this time, it should be carefully researched and considered in advance. His personal opinion is that in the future, the adjustment of prices for public utilities should be based on the average of the foreign exchange rate increase and the cost of living index to find a proper standard. In addition, the bad debts owed by agencies and troops should be paid off immediately to reduce the burden on citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu proposed three points: (1) The 50% import tariff on various imported materials for public utilities should be exempted or reduced. (2) Foreign exchange for oil and coal should be settled one to three months in advance at a time. (3) It is hoped that the accessories related to various public utilities in US aid can be supplied.</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Committee meeting is scheduled to convene a meeting at the committee again at 3:00 PM today to continue discussing the four review opinions. The council secretariat has already issued an urgent notice yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ten Cases Involving Suspected Hoarding of Materials in Warehouses Separately Agreed Upon Methods of Handling Five Units Approved for Relocation After Proof</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau previously held inspections of 32 warehouses that had exceeded the time limit for reporting in the upper month, in order to suppress prices and crack down on hoarding. As a result, 12 units suspected of hoarding were found. At the first review meeting on the 27th of the upper month, it was decided that they should state their reasons within seven days. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau invited relevant agencies to hold a second review meeting.

According to the company's statement, the goods are native paper, not rough-edged. After discussion, it was considered that the reasons were insufficient, and the inspection team will investigate again before making a decision. (2) Jianzhong Company's 20 tons of white coal stored in Litai Warehouse. The reasons stated by the company are insufficient and will be decided after further investigation. (3) Xinzhong Newspaper's 50 rolls of newsprint stored in Rongxing Warehouse. According to the newspaper, the Ministry of the Interior has approved the registration and will be published soon. After investigation, it is true and will be allowed to be relocated. (4) Tang Junyuan of Changsheng Company's cotton and fine cloth stored in the warehouse of China Business Company. After proof, it is indeed for self-dyeing and self-weaving and will be allowed to be relocated. (5) Dasheng Yarn Factory's single and double-linked cloth stored in the warehouse of Jiangsu Provincial Bank. After proof by the Textile Export Management Committee, it is indeed for export and will be allowed to be relocated. (6) Silk Industry Bank's cloth stored in Shunheng Warehouse. Will be decided after further investigation. (7) Sheng Zongfu's native cloth stored in Shunheng Warehouse. According to a letter from the Chongming Cotton Yarn and Native Cloth Trade Association, it is not being sold at present due to the unsuitable season and will be allowed to be relocated. (8) Tianjin Railway Bureau's 1,000 bags of flour stored in Shunheng Warehouse. According to a letter from the bureau, it is for the bureau's colleagues to use themselves and will be allowed to be relocated, but the bureau will be informed that if it stores flour in the future, it should be registered according to law. (9) Hongcheng Coal Company's 89 tons of Datong coal stored in Hengde Warehouse. According to a letter, the coal has been resold to Zhenye Coal Company, and it has been decided to order the inspection team to re-examine and verify.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another case of hoarding involving the Continental Bank, which is highly suspected and will be investigated again.</p>
<p>As for the remaining 300-odd warehouses that have already been reported, the inspections cannot be started until the inspection forms have been printed next week.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Justice Reiterates Previous Order Strictly Prohibiting Abuse of Criminal Defendant Detention; Future Promotion, Transfer, and Performance Evaluation to be Based on Strict Compliance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Justice, noting that local courts are abusing the detention of criminal defendants, which violates the original intent of the law, has specifically reiterated its previous order and circulated a strict prohibition. The judicial organs in this city have recently received this instruction, which states: "It has been found that due to limited funding, not all detention centers in various provinces have been fully constructed. Most of the existing buildings are dilapidated and cramped, and some sites were destroyed during the war and have not been repaired after the war. Criminal defendants are still being held in prisons. During this summer season, detention houses are crowded, which not only harms health but also makes them susceptible to disease. Moreover, the national treasury is depleted, and food prices are high. The government bears a huge burden for prisoner food, and providing assistance is particularly difficult. Unless measures are taken to alleviate this situation, it will be difficult to reduce the current difficulties. Whether a criminal defendant is guilty has not yet been decided. According to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, detention is not allowed unless one of the situations listed in Article 76 applies. The original intent of the legislation was to make non-detention the principle. Therefore, the Ministry has repeatedly issued orders to strictly prohibit the abuse of criminal defendant detention. According to the investigation forms submitted by various detention centers regarding the detention and investigation of defendants, the number of detainees is still very high, even more than double the number of convicted prisoners. This shows that personnel at all levels have not earnestly followed the original intent of the legislation. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated. The chief of each court must supervise their subordinates to strictly comply with the repeated announcements, strictly prohibit abuse of detention, expedite the investigation and trial of all pending cases, and clear up backlog cases. Newly received cases should also be handled promptly and not be detained casually. In the future, the promotion, transfer, and performance evaluation of prosecutors at all levels will be based on whether their handling of cases is appropriate and timely and whether there is any abuse of defendant detention. Each should be especially cautious and not be negligent in the slightest."</p>

<h3>Lawyer Ji Chao Wanted for a Case Ministry of Justice Orders Suspension of Legal Practice Lawyer Ji Denies Ever Committing a Crime</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Lawyer Ji Chao was previously wanted for a case, and the warrant has not yet been revoked. Recently, the Ministry of Justice has ordered the city's courts and the Shanghai Bar Association to comply with the order to suspend Ji's legal practice and revoke his registration due to the outstanding warrant.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the District Court said yesterday: Regarding the Ministry of Justice's order that lawyer Ji Chao be suspended from practicing law due to a wanted warrant, he is currently unable to specify the case in which Ji Chao committed the crime and will only be able to clarify it after investigating the case. Another famous lawyer in the city said about this incident: If lawyer Ji was indeed wanted for a case, it is possible that when the warrant was issued, Ji's name was listed in a large batch of wanted lists, and the general public did not know that he was a lawyer. After a long time, the court and the bar association were not aware that he was on the wanted list. Now the Ministry of Justice is re-issuing the previous order to draw public attention. This reporter also asked lawyer Ji by telephone last night whether he had been wanted for a case in the court in the past, and why the Ministry of Justice revoked his lawyer qualification? Lawyer Ji replied: He has never committed a crime in the past and does not know why there is suddenly talk of a wanted warrant. However, he also heard friends mention this matter in the High Court. According to what he knows, the Ministry's order has not yet arrived. Before the Ministry's order arrives, he is unwilling to speculate or defend himself regarding the truth of the matter.</p>

<h3>Fabricated Fabric Store Conned Goods Everywhere Four Criminals Arrested After Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Keming, the owner of Yiming Cotton Fabric Store at 538 Ningbo Road, bought four-gentlemen serge sold by Ma Zhongyi, Wang Gengxian, Li Yunlin, Xu Lianfa, and others from Xin Chang Cotton Fabric Store at the Cotton Fabric Association on June 25. He later learned that the store was fabricated and went to investigate, but the criminals had already fled, resulting in a huge loss. Chen reported the situation to the Laozha Police Station and requested an arrest. After investigation, it was found that Ma and the others had committed more than one crime. The affected businesses included Xiezhong, Baoxiang, Hanzhong, Lu Bingji, and Fuhua, totaling eleven businesses with a total loss of 7.882 billion yuan. Zhao, the chief of the Laozha Police Station, ordered the criminal investigation team to issue a strict arrest warrant.

<h3>Joint Association of Senior Merchant Marine Officers Expresses Regret Over Deng Huayi's Remarks</h3>
<p>Jiang Keni, the general manager of the China Merchant Marine Senior Officer Association, expressed regret over the remarks made by Deng Huayi, the chairman of the Chongqing Shipping Industry Association, who was worried that "crew members want to damage machinery," believing that it disparages the personality of crew members.

<h3>Tooth Marks Appear on Chest and Arms Secrets Revealed Two Women in Court for Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Chen Zhenxing, who once served as the manager of Ruili Company in this city, married Mei Ying in 1926 and lived together at 15, Lane 740, Fanhangdu Road, and had two sons and two daughters. Both sons have graduated from university. Chen's private life seemed quite serious, leaving early and returning late. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 28th of last month, Chen's Western-style shirt was suddenly torn, and female tooth bite marks were found on his left arm and chest. His wife, Mei Ying, was shocked to see this and discussed asking for compensation. Chen then confessed that he had a mistress, Lu Zhongying, who lived in Yongkang Lane, North Suzhou Road, for seven years. Recently, because Lu's demand for money was not met, they repeatedly argued and even beat each other. After hearing this, Mei Ying believed that Lu must have known that her husband had a spouse but still continued to commit adultery with him, which clearly constituted a crime of harming marriage, so she filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. After receiving the complaint, Lu was also unwilling to show weakness and filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing Chen Zhenxing of causing injury. Both cases were combined for investigation by the prosecutor yesterday. Because Chen did not arrive, the court ordered the case to be rescheduled for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Wang Zhebin's Trafficking Case The Beijing Police Bureau Replied to the District Court Xu Songjiu Cannot Be Found</h3>
<p>Regarding the drug trafficking case of Wang Zhebin, a legislator nominated and elected by the China Democratic Socialist Party, after the District Court accepted the case, it sent a letter to the Beijing Police Bureau requesting an investigation. The Beijing Police Bureau replied to the District Court yesterday, reporting the results of the investigation. Regarding Wang Zhebin's statement that the suitcase of drugs he was carrying was entrusted to him by his friend Xu Songjiu, who resided at 29, Hejia Compound, Tianqiao, Beijing, the bureau dispatched personnel to the address to arrest him, but they found that there was no number 29 in Hejia Compound, nor was there a Xu Songjiu. Moreover, Liu Wu, the wife of co-defendant Liu Runge, stated that Liu went to Nanjing in January and claimed to be unaware of Liu's alleged drug trafficking.</p>
<h3>Blind Man Dies Under Vehicle Driver Sentenced but Objects</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jiang Weibang, the driver of an English-owned tram on Route 1, was driving west to east along Beijing West Road at 9:50 AM on July 3. When he arrived at the Jiangning Road intersection, he accelerated to pass, fearing obstruction by the red light. At that moment, Lou Zirong was crossing the road from north to south. The driver was unable to brake in time, causing Lou Zirong to be knocked down and suffer severe head injuries. He was sent to the hospital by police car but eventually died. Jiang Weibang was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, which immediately filed a public prosecution for causing death by negligence. Judge Fang Xianghai of the District Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon. Chen Lou, the daughter of the victim Lou Zirong, requested that the defendant be sentenced and filed an incidental civil suit. The defendant argued that the deceased Lou Zirong was blind and was killed when he walked into the tram, not run over in front of it, so it was clearly not his fault. Witness Pang Youchang, a passenger, testified that when the deceased ran into the tram, someone behind him shouted, "Uncle, the tram is coming! The victim did not hear and still squeezed onto the tram." The defendant's lawyer argued that the points raised by the prosecutor in the public prosecution were untenable; the 100 million yuan paid by the English-owned tram company was a condolence payment to the victim, not compensation for negligence. After the debate ended, Judge Fang announced the verdict in court: Jiang Weibang was sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence for causing death by negligence in the course of his business. The plaintiff expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and will file an appeal.</p>

<h3>Development of Xin'an River</h3>
<h3>Prospects for Hydropower Engineering</h3>
<p>The Xin'an River originates from the counties of Xiuning, She, Yi, Qi, Wu, and Jixi. At Meihua Beach in Jiekou Town of She County, it possesses abundant water resources with a large volume and rapid flow. The drop is very high. It is a unique hydropower resource in southeastern China. The farmland along the river reaches more than 8 million mu, with abundant products. Downstream, it converges with the Yan River, Tong River, and Qiantang River in Zhejiang. If we utilize the natural terrain of Jiekou to design a dam for power generation, it will enable the counties in southern Anhui to fully utilize their land, make the best use of their resources, facilitate the flow of goods, and boost agriculture, commerce, industry, and mining. Internal and external transportation will be unimpeded, directly benefiting the people and indirectly benefiting the nation. According to experts' estimates for the entire hydropower project, the initial development of 80,000 kilowatts requires only US$2.8 million. It is sincerely hoped that our government will consult with the United States Economic Cooperation Administration to send specialized technical personnel to conduct further surveys. Fund allocation should be made under the US aid program to quickly advance the project. If US aid funds are difficult to allocate quickly, the estimated amount, converted into rice, is only 2 million shi. With the financial resources of various places in southeastern China, it will not be difficult to raise funds separately, making the burden light. Using local financial resources to build dams for power generation brings permanent and boundless benefits with a temporary and limited burden. Why not do it! Moreover, the entire project is expected to be completed in two years, requiring a short time and yielding immediate results, unlike waiting for the Yellow River to clear. Now, let's briefly discuss the expected benefits after power generation:</p>
<h3>Industry and Mining</h3>
<p>China's industrial and mining enterprises have suffered a lot of damage in recent years due to war. In areas where transportation is blocked, even if there are mineral deposits, it is difficult to exploit them. Southern Anhui has always been rich in mineral deposits. Such as the iron in Fanchang and Dangtu, the copper in Tongling and Tongguanshan, the antimony in Xiuning, the gold in Jixi, and the coal in Xuanning, which are the most prominent. With hydropower facilities, it will be easier to develop the above-mentioned mineral deposits. In the future, the white coal in southern Anhui and the black coal in Huainan will compete side by side and be used for the country, which is the most beneficial thing. Without hydropower generation, mining is not easy and refining is even more difficult. Goods are abandoned in the ground, and people suffer from poverty. If the cotton in Guichi and Dongliu, the ramie silk in Qingyang, and the bamboo and wood in Huizhou, all the raw materials that can be used for the fiber industry, as well as the processing of various agricultural products, cannot be prospered without hydropower.</p>
<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p>Southern Anhui is a land of fish and rice. The mountainous areas are also places where mountain farmers live and thrive. If we want to increase production and eliminate worries about floods and droughts, we can only rely on hydropower generation. It can provide resources for flood control in times of flooding, and irrigation in times of drought. Negatively, it can eliminate disasters. We can also use electricity to produce agricultural fertilizers, actively increasing resources. And it can make the benefits of electrification available to remote rural areas. Life is prosperous, healthy, wealthy, and both national economy and people's livelihood are reliable.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Xin'an River is the mainstream connecting Anhui and Zhejiang, but unfortunately, the beaches and shoals are continuous, making navigation difficult. The danger of downstream navigation is equal to the Three Gorges. Upstream travel relies entirely on human traction, which is difficult and slow, exceeding expectations. As the saying goes: "One beach is ten feet high, Xin'an is in the sky." So it's no wonder. Now, if we use hydropower at Jiekou in Xin'an River, the water volume will be deepened and the river channel will be flattened. It is possible to navigate electric boats, making water transportation completely change its old appearance. On the land side, not only can all the highways in southern Anhui be converted to electric vehicles, but also the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway can use this hydropower. (It seems less than a quarter of thermal power) I read in the newspaper that people in Zhejiang Province are now working hard on the Qiantang River hydropower project. It is hoped that they can choose sites in Lan River, Qu River, Yan River, and Tong River to carry out projects. Anhui Province focuses on creating facilities at Jiekou. Let Anhui and Zhejiang make the most of their hydropower, cooperate, and let Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhu all benefit from it. It is not only a temporary and local benefit, but also a benefit for all ages.</p>
<h3>Other Discussion</h3>
<p>The above points are related to enriching the country and benefiting the people. I hope that the gentlemen of our country will rise up to support them together. And unanimously call on the government to complete the surveying of the Hui River. Actively prepare for implementation. As for the increased water level after the dam is built, the fields and houses along the Xin'an River may be the first to suffer. We should plan ahead and provide thorough relief. Make sure that those who suffer do not feel the pain of the disaster, and that those who are relocated are happy to receive more benefits. If everyone, like the old man who lost his horse, thinks that it will be beneficial and not harmful, it will depend on the motivation of the organizer and the relationship between the interests of the local people as the criterion. It cannot be completely said in one word. (Thank You)</p>
<h3>Social Service</h3>
<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<h3>Legal Interpretation</h3>
<h3>Creating Misery for Descendants by Leaving Thousands of Acres of Good Land</h3>
<h3>Analyzing the Dispute Over Ancestral Property Between Cousins</h3>
<p>Li Shizhong asks: There is a piece of ancestral vacant land in my hometown, owned by three branches of the family. In the spring of the 33rd year, the nephew and cousin-in-law (when the cousin was in the mainland) colluded to sell two-fifths of it. When I heard about it, I was unable to stop it. I had no choice but to make an agreement with the cousin-in-law for the remaining part, each managing it separately. I notified my cousin before and after, and he did not object. Who knew that my cousin returned to Shanghai last year and reversed the agreement, agreeing with me to sign a "Return of Courtyard Agreement" (a corner under my name), agreeing to pay 15 shi of white rice as the price. Several months have passed since the agreement was signed, but it has not been fulfilled. I would like to ask: (1) Is the separation agreement established during the enemy-puppet period valid? (Although the cousin was not present, the clan chief and two witnesses participated and signed the agreement). (2) Is the voucher obtained by deceiving me this spring valid? Only the clan chief signed and I signed, and no witnesses were present. (3) What means should be used to deal with it if my cousin infringes on the land boundary in the future?</p>
<p>[Answer from Mr. An Mingshi] (1) According to Article 1021 of the Civil Code, a wife can dispose of joint property within the scope of agency power stipulated in Article 1003. And Article 1003 of the Civil Code stipulates that husband and wife are mutual agents in daily household affairs. Furthermore, according to Article 1023 and Article 1024 of the Civil Code, the various debts stipulated therein shall either be the responsibility of the husband or be the responsibility of paying off all of his property. Therefore, whether the separation agreement established in the 23rd year mentioned in this case is valid depends entirely on whether the agency power at the time of disposition meets the above regulations. (2) The so-called fraud should be subject to the burden of proof. (3) The so-called encroachment on the land boundary, this land boundary should first be proven to be owned by the infringed person. Therefore, confirming ownership and clearly delineating the boundaries can determine whether there is infringement. Self-governing institutions such as district offices are familiar with the local situation and can mediate the facts; however, trials should be handled by the court.</p>

<h3>National Banks Expand Interbank Teller Quotas</h3>
<h3>Currency Shortage Still Not Resolved</h3>
<h3>Financial Control Bureau to Crack Down on Banks' and Firms' Indiscriminate Issuance of Promissory Notes</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has requested the restoration of the use of bills as collateral. According to Lin Chongyong, Director of the Financial Control Bureau: this matter needs to be carefully studied, but after the implementation of the ban on collateral, there are indeed drawbacks that need to be improved.</p>
<p>In addition, the Financial Control Bureau is drafting measures to regulate national banks, and is actively inspecting commercial banks and firms. A working group was dispatched yesterday.</p>
<p>Currently, due to the severe currency shortage, small banks and firms are developing large numbers of promissory notes, forming a disguised form of credit expansion. The Financial Control Bureau is paying close attention to this and will take measures to crack down on it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Financial Control Bureau, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. According to Lin, he was personally instructed by President Weng in Beijing to strengthen financial control in Shanghai. The measures to strengthen control will be incorporated into the soon-to-be-completed economic reform plan and announced for implementation. As for reducing banking units to enhance the strength of the financial industry, it is said that there is no rigid requirement to reduce the number of 6,000 to 2,000. Effective adjustments will be made in accordance with the time and place.</p>
<p>[Commodity Survey Institute News] The long-standing cash shortage situation slightly improved yesterday. The Central Bank increased the withdrawal quota for interbank, with the maximum changed to 120 billion yuan. The market premium continued to be small, about 5%. However, the demand for 1 million yuan bills is still very high, and the premium rate remains at 10%. According to sources from the Central Bank: the bank's daily issuance of banknotes in Shanghai is currently increased to 3 to 5 trillion yuan per day. The Shanghai Central Printing Factory can print 20 to 30 trillion yuan per day, but it must supply the provinces of Central and South China, so the issuance in this city cannot fully meet the demand.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<h3>Flour, Grains, Oil, and Cakes All Follow Suit</h3>
<p>The rice market has seen soaring prices again. Credit has become increasingly loose and indiscriminate. Tin prices have been reported to have risen, and people's expectations have become firmer and higher, with strong buying interest. Opening prices immediately rose under the procurement of rice stores, and sellers immediately raised prices. In the Nanshi market, Jiashan new indica rice has appeared on the market, with an opening price of 38.5 million. Other japonica rice and thin rice all rose by 2 million yuan compared to the previous day, but the market was slightly weaker later. In the Beishi market, the prices of various grades of japonica and indica rice jumped by 3 to 3.5 million yuan. The price of high-quality japonica rice was at a new high of 46.5 million, and the price of thin rice also rose to 46 million yuan. Yesterday, a total of 5,252 shi of goods arrived in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>The price of flour has risen sharply, and credit has become looser. Under the procurement of Beibang, the main street and retail investors, it jumped up. The price of old car flour was 14.9 million yuan, and the price of battleship flour also rose to 14.6 million yuan under the absorption of Beibang. The former rose by 1.15 million yuan, and the latter rose by 1.35 million yuan. The prices of other miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan, bran rose by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, and the factory price of wheat increased by 1 million yuan, with transactions at 18.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>The price of miscellaneous grains has continued to rise. The loosening of credit has increased the buying momentum, so the market situation is very brisk. Moreover, because the cost of transportation has increased again, the sellers have held on firmly. The price of soybeans has risen by 2 million yuan. New corn has appeared on the market, with an opening price of 25 million yuan. The prices of other corn have increased by 1 million yuan. Yuanmai also rose by 2 million yuan. The sales of mung beans are sluggish and have remained stable. Sesame has been absorbed in large quantities by the Tianjin gang and has risen sharply by 5 to 6 million yuan. Raw peanuts have been taken up by the Guangdong gang and have risen sharply by 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>The price of cooking oil has risen sharply due to rising raw material prices. Factories have raised prices, and retail investors have a strong desire to procure due to the looser credit. Moreover, out-of-town merchants have also come to patronize. Under the brisk situation, the price has risen sharply. The initial price of soybean oil was 99 million yuan, and then it broke through the 100 million mark straight under the buying pressure. High-quality soybean oil reached 105 million yuan, an increase of 14 million yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose by 14 to 15 million yuan, and raw oil rose by 13 million yuan. Under the force of Tianjin Gang, the price of sesame oil in small vehicles rose from 100.5 million yuan to 125 million yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan. Soybean cake also rose by 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Qihong Market Trend is Firm</h3>
<p>The Qimen black tea, which is mainly sold to the United Kingdom, has been steadily sold by the capitalists. However, due to the high prices, the buyers have been hesitant and the process has been quiet for a long time. However, the exchange settlement application has risen endlessly, resulting in exporters searching for good prices one after another, and the transaction has gradually become clear. Especially yesterday, in the mutual competition of Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and other foreign firms, the transaction volume doubled, and the market still showed its strength. The prices of other varieties all followed the trend.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Replication Industry</h3>
<h3>Preparing to Organize an Export Agency</h3>
<p>In order to expand exports, the cotton yarn replication industry is preparing to organize an export company. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the dyeing and weaving industry association, has been discussing with other important replication industry leaders in recent days and has drafted measures and is actively proceeding. According to Pan yesterday, the previous export association's measures were inappropriate and caused a lot of harm. Similar industries have trademarks with a reputation abroad. Foreign countries often send telegrams to purchase, but because they are under control, they cannot directly export. After the export association transfers the goods, there are many losses. After gathering and discussing, industries believe that they should organize an export company to specialize in the sale of cotton yarn replicas, which can complement the export company organized by the yarn factory industry. The dyeing and weaving industry has united with other important replication industries, drafted measures, collected statistics, and sent himself and others to Beijing in the near future to meet with President Weng, Minister Chen, etc., to personally report on the current export situation of cotton yarn replicas and to actively organize export agencies in contact with all parties so that they can be established in a short period of time.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that the joint venture company previously formed by the replication industry was forced to suspend operations due to management methods. The new organization led by the dyeing and weaving industry this time is different from before.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise First and Then Fall</h3>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales are Booming and Prices are Rising Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation was because credit was very loose, and the buying intentions of both local and out-of-town merchants were still strong. Due to the fact that the raw material cotton inventory of manufacturers was dwindling and the distribution of US-aided cotton was slow to relieve the urgent need, the offering intention was relaxed, and those who had goods took the opportunity to raise prices.</p>
<p>The initial price of 42-count blue phoenix fine yarn was immediately raised to 150 million, and the high price of 220 million was offered for tomorrow. Afterwards, due to the briskness of the cloth market, people's expectations were even stronger, and the prices of various yarns created new highs. Near the close, it was heard that the situation in the interior had slightly declined, and the price was finally closed at 220 million for immediate delivery and 224 million for delivery tomorrow, which was an increase of 145 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 50 to 60 million to 120 to 3 million yuan, and 66 pieces were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was brisk because the hidden interest rate was low, credit was loose, and the trend turned active, and people's expectations were also strong. The Changjiang Gang and the Tianjin-Hankou-Changsha Gang competed to purchase and transport due to rising freight rates. Cloth merchants also thought that the northern sales would start soon and the market situation was promising. Dyeing factories held on to few offerings due to increased labor and material costs and public utility costs, and the market presented a situation of more demand than supply.</p>
<p>The initial market price of 12-pound dragon head fine cloth was immediately raised again by 2.8 million yuan. Subsequently, the floating was more active due to the fierce absorption by similar businesses, and the market price rose to 65 to 66 million yuan for transactions. It finally closed at 64.5 million yuan, which was an increase of 5.3 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other markets also generally increased by 10% to 15%, and 2,620 pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>China Textile Sells Yarn</h3>
<h3>Reaching More Than 10 Billion</h3>
<p>Yesterday, China Textile Company sold five types of yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee. 32 purchasers were approved, and 161 pieces of cotton yarn were sold, with a value of 241.9 billion yuan. In addition, yesterday, Textile Construction Company opened for sale 12 types of cotton yarn, issued 299 purchase permits, sold 718 pieces of yarn, and a total of 1,064.5 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a value of 1,192.6 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Production This Year</h3>
<h3>May Reach 2 Million Dan</h3>
<h3>Only Enough for One-Third of Demand</h3>
<p>The new cotton planted in various places this year has now gradually matured and will begin to be harvested in mid-next month. The cotton authorities have ordered cotton growers in various places to pay attention to harvesting technology.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the new cotton in various places this year can produce a total of 3 million dan. Based on the domestic demand, this output is only one-third of the demand, and two-thirds still need to rely on foreign cotton imports.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Shanghai's Fourth Nine Factory and Maosheng Cotton Industry Company in Chongqing purchased more than a thousand bales of Shaanxi cotton, but they have not been released due to the strict implementation of orders by the Water Police Bureau. Cotton merchants stationed in Chongqing are complaining. It is heard that the Sui Administration is still cracking down on cotton merchants moving cotton to the east, and they are trying to petition for the lifting of the ban.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Deposit Certificate Utilization Issue</h3>
<h3>It is Heard That Two Principles Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the issuance and utilization of special foreign currency deposit certificates, people in the wool textile industry and the import and export industry in this city have recently repeatedly requested the Central Bank to issue them quickly and allow them to be utilized. However, so far, there are no concrete results. According to a semi-official source, the authorities are studying the matter in detail in recent days. It is heard that in addition to materials compulsorily purchased, foreign currency deposit certificates will still be issued and allowed to be utilized. For the parts purchased and resold by China Trust, it may be converted into legal currency. It is said that although the export situation has slightly improved in the past few days, the number is still very limited, and the expenditures are extremely large. It is uncertain whether there are sufficient foreign exchange positions to pay when the deposit certificates expire.</p>
<h3>Four Banks and Two Bureaus Have a Net Difference of More Than 570 Billion</h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit was extremely loose and indiscriminate, and the market interest rate gradually dropped to about 55%. Commodity markets were consistently strong. During the afternoon interbank bill exchange, the net difference of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury created another unprecedented record, with a total amount of 575.6 billion. The Central Bank had a net difference of 300.71 billion, the Bank of China had a net difference of 92.51 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net difference of 23.38 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net difference of 23.89 billion, China Trust had a net difference of 85.68 billion, the Postal Savings Bank had a net difference of 21.3 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net difference of 28.13 billion. Commercial banks had a large net difference of 126.73 billion, a small net difference of 26.36 billion, and foreign banks had a total net difference of 185.28 billion. It is understood that the huge net difference of the banks yesterday, in addition to a part of the remittance expenditure, the main reason was the payment for the purchase of flour and other materials. Among the materials purchased, except for a part transported to North China, most of them are controlled by the Central Bank and are prepared for sale. The third is the payment of huge military and political funds.</p>

<h3>The Price of Foreign Exchange Certificates is Gradually Rising</h3>
<h3>Overseas Remittances May Be Directly Remitted to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th Dispatch] (1) It is learned that due to the continuous rise in the price of foreign exchange certificates, according to the current situation, it is more beneficial to directly remit overseas remittances to Guangzhou than to remit them to Hong Kong. According to the person in charge of the Guangzhou Branch of the Bank of China, it can earn at least 20% more than the black market, because each US dollar draft is worth 5.2 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong. And each US dollar draft of the bank is worth 400,400 yuan in national currency according to the listed price, plus the bank's foreign exchange certificate price of 5.13 million yuan per US dollar, and each US dollar draft is worth a total of 5,534,000 yuan in national currency. Currently, each Hong Kong dollar is worth 880,000 yuan in national currency, and 5,534,000 yuan can be worth more than 6.28 Hong Kong dollars, that is, if overseas remittances are officially remitted back by the national bank, each US dollar can get more than 6.28 Hong Kong dollars, and if remitted to Hong Kong through illegal channels, it can get 5.2 Hong Kong dollars. The person in charge also said that if this situation can be maintained for a month, all overseas remittance problems can be easily solved.</p>

<h3>Macau Miss Aircraft Incident: Inside Story of the Mid-Air Robbery</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Canton Dispatch, Second Day] The "Macau Miss" passenger plane plying the Hong Kong-Macau route "crashed" into the sea off Macau on July 16th. The pilot and 27 passengers were on board. Except for passenger Huang Yuan (also known as Huang Yao), who was rescued, all 26 others perished. This news had already been published in this newspaper through telegrams and air dispatches. However, at the time, everyone thought it was just a regular plane crash and did not suspect any other secrets. Later, because the sole survivor, passenger Huang Yuan's, testimony was contradictory and his behavior suspicious, it aroused the attention of the Macau police authorities. At the same time, the general public also felt that the weather was very good that day, and the "Macau Miss" was an amphibious aircraft with variable engines. The incident occurred only a few minutes after takeoff, so even if the engine malfunctioned, it could descend for repairs without sinking into the sea. Therefore, everyone felt that the cause of the accident was bizarre and suspected that it might be a mid-air robbery. Bao Li, the head of the Macau Police Department, also sought clues from Huang Yuan and thoroughly examined the recovered aircraft wreckage and the bodies of the victims. After two weeks of effort, it has now been confirmed that this was an unprecedented major aircraft robbery. The surviving passenger Huang Yuan is one of the robbers. The whole process contains untold details, and the Macau authorities' breaking this tortuous major case in just two weeks can be described as a miracle in the history of detective work.</p>
<p>"Doumen People" Most Suspicious</p>
<p>Since the "Macau Miss" incident was suspected to be a mid-air robbery, the criminals were naturally among the passengers. Therefore, pursuing this lead naturally had to start with the passengers. The list and identities of the passengers that day were: (1) Huang Yuan (i.e., Huang Yao), (2) Zhao Chang, (3) Zhao Cai, (4) Zhao Yiming, (5) Lin Yun'ai (associated with He Yi Company), (6) Huo Songping (owner of Australia Xie Feng Company and Hong Kong Da San Yuan Restaurant), (7) Huang Zhida (nickname "Suffering Protection," a wealthy merchant from Shiqiao), (8) Wu Shouwen (General Manager of Coca-Cola South China), (9) Mrs. Wu Shouwen, (10) Li Yili (Manager of Guangzhou Real Estate Company), (11) Miss Huang (Li Yili's girlfriend), (12) Ms. Fang (wife of Hong Kong Professor Li Weilin), (The following are foreign passengers) (13) Shi Diaowei (Deputy Manager of Texaco Oil Company), (14) Mrs. Shi Diaowei, (15) He Zhiwen (Wholesale Director of Texaco Company), (16) to (19) Mr. and Mrs. Nelson and their two children, (20) Bi Liela (Portuguese merchant), (21) Mosigewei (Manager of an Indian Circus), (22) Mrs. Kanfuli (British), (23) Mrs. Shi Mieshi, and pilot Jia Lianma, assistant pilot Mai Tafu, Cathay Pacific Airways passenger service director Ke Shide, stewardess Da Gaoshida, etc., a total of twenty-seven people.</p>
<p>Looking at the list above, among the twelve Chinese passengers, the latter eight were merchants and businessmen who had actual residences and occupations in Hong Kong and Macau. Only four had no addresses in Hong Kong or Macau and were registered as "Doumen People" when purchasing tickets. Therefore, these four were naturally the most suspicious. Moreover, one night, the only rescued Huang Yuan was seen by the hospital guard secretly getting out of bed and attempting to walk (his leg was broken). Also, one night, he untied the bandages and attempted suicide, but was stopped by the guard. He also asked someone to bring a message to his family and instructed the messenger to keep the address strictly confidential. These secretive actions aroused the attention of the police, so they confined him to a separate room, prohibited him from talking to outsiders, and rigorously interrogated him while investigating the background of the other three.</p>
<p>The Origins of the Four Robbers Clarified</p>
<p>After several days of investigation, the police have learned the backgrounds of the four:</p>
<p>Huang Yuan—From Doumen, Zhongshan. During the Japanese puppet era, he served as the captain of the puppet guards in Tanzhou Township, Zhongshan. He had committed crimes in Macau.</p>
<p>Zhao Chang—From Doumen, Zhongshan. He was the "chief strategist" among the four robbers.</p>
<p>Zhao Cai—Also known as Zhao Sancai, from Chikan. He was originally a farmer but later associated with hooligans.</p>
<p>Zhao Yiming—Once served as a pilot and studied aviation in Manila. He was one of the oldest of the four robbers.</p>
<p>In addition, a part of the recovered aircraft wreckage was examined by experts, who determined that the aircraft was not on fire at the time and had no signs of a strong explosion. A bullet hole was found on the recovered wing, and one of the recovered bodies of passengers had a bullet wound, proving that the bullet entered from the chest and exited from the back. The body of assistant pilot Mai Tafu also had four and a half millimeter bullet wounds below the neck and on the back. At the same time, a .38 caliber revolver cartridge case was also recovered.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the backgrounds of these four people, plus this kind of material evidence, the shocking mid-air robbery was confirmed. Moreover, the robber Huang Yuan could no longer deny it. He had no choice but to confess the truth and reveal their conspiracy to commit the robbery.</p>
<p>The Robbery Plan Prepared in Advance</p>
<p>Originally, their robbery was a planned conspiracy. They began preparing half a month in advance. Huang Yuan had spent three thousand Hong Kong dollars to carry out the matter. They took the plane back and forth between Hong Kong and Macau several times to understand the internal structure of the aircraft. They planned to take control of the aircraft, then have Zhao Yiming fly it to a predetermined location where four fishing boats were scheduled to receive the stolen goods. After the robbery, the passengers would be kidnapped for ransom. The distribution plan had also been drafted: the four robbers who boarded the plane would each receive one share, while the four fishing boats would share one share. On July 16th, they changed into suits and bought four tickets together, numbers 15, 16, 17, and 18, to board the plane as passengers.</p>
<p>Boarding the Plane, Occupying Four Positions</p>
<p>The four robbers occupied four positions. Zhao Cai was in the first position, close to the pilot and co-pilot's seats. Zhao Chang and Zhao Yiming stood in the first and third positions, monitoring the passengers on both sides and searching them. Huang Yuan stood at the main entrance to command everything.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the takeoff, Zhao Cai used a gun to threaten the pilot and co-pilot. The pilot and co-pilot were sitting on the left and right sides of the cockpit. After being threatened, they dared not move. It was learned that Shi Diaowei, the deputy manager of Texaco Company among the passengers, was a burly and powerful man. Seeing this, he knew that he was being robbed, so he rose to attack Zhao Cai. Unexpectedly, Zhao Yiming was right behind him and also pointed a gun at him. But Shi Diaowei did not submit. The two men then engaged in a dispute. The other passengers fled in panic, and the fuselage swayed from side to side. In the chaos, the pilot Jia Lianma secretly grabbed an iron bar and planned to turn around and strike Zhao Cai. Zhao immediately fired eight shots at Jia. Jia was immediately shot down. The plane immediately lost control and plunged downwards. The co-pilot was also unable to save it and crashed directly into the sea. At that time, Huang Yuan, who was standing at the entrance, saw that the situation was not good and hurriedly grabbed two seat cushions and jumped into the sea. The other twenty-six people unfortunately fell into the sea with the plane and died tragically. Later, Huang Yuan, the only survivor, became the key for the police to solve the case.</p>
<p>Conflicting Rumors About the Target of the Robbery</p>
<p>As for the target of their robbery, there are currently many conflicting rumors. Some say that they attempted to kidnap the wealthy merchants Huang Songping and Huang Zhida. However, it was later found that the two Huangs purchased their tickets after the four robbers, so this theory does not seem credible. The passenger carrying the most cash that day was Li Yili. According to his family, he had about four thousand US dollars. However, whether he was the main target of the robbery has not yet been confirmed by the police.</p>
<p>Now, this mid-air robbery case has finally come to an end. Of the four perpetrators, other than Huang Yuan, the other three have died. The police are now hunting down the other criminals involved in receiving the aircraft. Hong Kong Civil Aviation Director Si and the manager of Cathay Pacific Airways, Di Gengsu, along with two mechanical engineers, have traveled from Hong Kong to Macau to jointly study the case further with the police. After the surviving criminal Huang Yuan is handed over to the judiciary for trial, the whole case will be revealed.</p>

<p>[Xinxiang Dispatch, Fifth Day] Former Xinxiang County Magistrate Li Kuiguang was investigated by the Twelfth Pacification Zone for providing military funds to bandits. The results have proven that he conspired with Zhang Guozhen.
