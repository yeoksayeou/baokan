<p>〔本報南京二日電〕關於運用美援之中·美雙邊協定，將於三日下午三時一刻在外交部正式簽字公布，同時，我政府並將爲此發表聲明，我國簽字全權代表已經蔣總統於一日頒令派外長王世杰充任，美方代表則爲大使司徒雷登。據確息：該協定之有效期間爲十五個月，自簽字之日即行生效。協定中並無我國須在貿易上予日本及南韓最惠國待遇之規定，其他則與歐洲各接受美援國家與美國間之雙邊協定大致相同。根據該協定，運用美援之若干技術細節，須另訂合約或由我行政當局採取適當措施，均已在中美雙方磋商中，將陸續有所決定。至關於「中國農村復興聯合會」事項，則將另訂協定。</p>
<p>協定條文要點</p>
<p>雙邊協定之序言中，引述美國此次援華之目的與精神，並說明中美兩國根據美國國會通過，並經中國立法院決議接受之援華法案，訂立協定。其條文規定之要點略爲：（一）美國政府對華援助之措施及其終止，均係根據國會制定之法案。中國政府將儘力完成其自助復興計劃，並承允與美國合作，運用援助物資售得款項之一部，以改良對美匯兌及民營貿易。（二）中國政府將切實執行其自助計劃，充分有效運用其資源·人力，美援及中國人在美財產，以增加生產，並採取必要措置穩定金融，促進貿易。（三）中美雙方於必要時，應互相諮商，俾美國政府可保證其公民在中國政府所批准之計劃中之投資，結得美匯。（四）中國政府應於接受贈予性美援時，積存等値之法幣。此宗款項將用於在華美國援華執行機構之行政費，救濟物資內地運輸費，及其他　美雙方協議之用途，包括中國　產力之發展，與美國所需原料之開發生產，國債之償還，與其他制止通貨膨脹之計劃。（五）中國政府同意將與美國訂定合約，俾美國可獲致其所需原料之增加供應。（六）中國政府同意合作，便利美人對華運輸。中美雙方並將商訂美國政府及私人贈予之一切救濟物資之免稅進口辦法。（七）中國政府同意供給美國政府所需有關其復興計劃之擬訂與執行之充分報吿。中美兩國之一方，提出由於協定引起之任何問題時，雙方應協商解決之。（八）美國政府得派遺特別代表團來華，以實施協定規定事項，並視察援助計劃之執行。中國政府將對美方工作人員，予以一般外交豁免。（九）由於中國政府之措施引起其與美國公民　之爭執，將由國際法庭或雙方同意組成之公斷法庭裁決之。（十）協定有效期間爲十五個月，中美兩國之一方倘認爲協定規定事項發生根本之變更，例如援助於預定日期前吿終等原因，雙方將會商決定協定將是否加以修改或提前廢止。如此項協議不能取得任何一方同意，得爲六個月之預吿，通知對方以廢止之。（十一）協定廢止後尙待運用之美援物資及法幣存款，由中美雙方協議處理，而其他根據協定訂定之合約，則依其本身規定時期繼續有效，不受影響。</p>
<h3 id="c17">監察院休會 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕監察院已決定自二日下午起暫行休會，俟監察院各項法規經立法院完成立法程序後，再以之制訂各項規章，繼續舉行會議。休會時日不定，惟在休會期間，同意權之行使，不受此限，院長可臨時召集會議，行使同意權。頃聞總統提名之大法官及考試委員名單，即可送監院，故休會之時日或不至過久。監院休會之決定係於二日晨舉行之第十六次會議中通過者。十六次會議仍由于右任主席，宣佈開會後，秘書處宣讀第十五次會議紀錄後，當提出郭昌鶴等五十五人之臨時緊急動議一件稱：「關於本院各項法案之提案權問題，與本院行使職權，推進監察任務有極重要密切之關係，同仁等認爲須迅循合法合理途徑，先求解決，擬請由本院院會決議咨請總統依據憲法第四十四條之規定，迅行召集有關院院長會議，確定解決辦法；在此期間，本院院會暫行休會」。除由郭昌鶴予以說明外，各委員對休會之意見甚多，發言踴躍，歷久不決。各委員不贊同休會之意見在於該案所提休會之理由不適宜，似存對立院要挾之嫌。旋由梁上棟提出修正意見稱：「本院各項法規，在未經立法院完成立法程序之前，本院一般規章，無法制訂，擬請暫行休會？」當提付表決，多數人贊同即獲通過。會議於十二時半散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕監委中有多數人認爲有檢討過去監院工作之必要，正醞釀提案一件：「擬請成立特種委員會，檢討前屆本院歷年提付懲戒各案，促其澈底實施，充分發揮監察效能，整飭吏治，以振人心案。」該案正徵求簽名中，將俟復會後提出討論。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二日電〕立法院院長孫科偕夫人，於二日晚十一時夜車赴滬。又顧毓　亦於夜車赴滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二電〕立法院秘書處發表立院二日晨舉行第二次全院秘密會議，聽取政府對總預算之報吿。九時廿五分開會，出席委員五百餘人，由孫院長主席，政院翁院長，徐主計長，王財長，央行兪總裁均列席，首由秘書處宣讀政院所送之卅七年下半年度中央政府歲出歲入總預算及特別預算兩咨文後，即由翁院長及徐·王兩氏先後報吿編製預算情形。徐主計長報吿時間最長，約及一小時，翁院長與王財長各約半小時。總預算案有兩大特點，其一爲普通預算，可以稅收抵付支出，並有餘額，其二爲特別預算，以出售政府握有之物資及其他辦法相抵，可不再增加通貨發行。三氏報吿畢。已屆十一時十五分。休息十分鐘，繼續開會，即有立法委員四十餘人要求發言質詢，計發言至第八人時，因已屆正午，遂吿散會。下午三時續會，有委員動議變更議程，改爲檢討物價問題，經無異通過，</p>

<h3 id="c23">社論　壓平物價與澈查漲風 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>六，裏漲風實在來得瘋狂，驚濤駭浪，已使小民喘不過氣來。現在六底方過，七月初的紅盤，今天要開，大家都提心吊權，盼望驚勿再有驚人的跳細。本市市政當局和軍警首長，昨天整日爲了此事有緊急會商，中央銀行總裁今天也將趕回上海，有所防範。雷厲風行的壓平物價運動，是否能收到相當效果，就要看政府和善良人民是否能打成一片，執行政府法令的人是否能潔己率公。尤其要緊的，是政府在平價運動中必須採取領導作風。</p>
<p>行憲後的新政府在六月裏開始執政，立法院和監察院眼盾各地物價暴騰，便紛紛起來責難，受了人民付託之重的委員們當然要有一番表示。據聞立法院會請翁院長出席報告，監察院更要派員澈查原因，其實物價狂漲是一事實，行政當局何　否認，物價狂漲有其原因，大家也都大概明瞭，澈查結果也不過如此這般，於物價本身有何補救，對人民身上又有何好處？委員們深居獨念，總以爲物價的狂漲不外是奸商在操縱，豪門在作祟，祗要證據確鑿，殺一便足儆百。果眞如此簡單，世界經濟也就不致恐慌，我們中國的種種問題，也似乎早可迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>物價的漲有兩種：一種是緩和的漲，一種是瘋狂的漲。從經濟學的原理講，在中央銀行所發的短期國庫劵月息高至二角四分的時候，在政府採取高利政策，市上一般利息在三角四角的時候，緩和的上漲原是天公地道無可遇抑的。因為無論為　爲工爲商，無不是將本求利的，利息如此之高，加了種種的開支和合法的利潤，每月物價照利息的比例上漲，實是不足爲奇。除非政府改採低利政策，這趨勢是不會變的。惟是瘋狂的漲，漲而出於常情之外，似是幕後有人，呼之欲出。時論歸罪於軍事失利，游資泛濫，赤字公佈，等等因素，未始不是各有理由，但何當能搔着癢處？軍事失利不自今始，游資本來跟着通貨日在泛濫，赤字大小，大家心中也早明白，那時物價並不狂漲，而六月却漲上加特，豈非幕後有人在掀風作浪？那麽幕後促成漲風的勢力究竟是什麽呢？且看一些事實的分析。</p>
<p>民生日用所必需，不外食衣住行四項。政府對於一般的經濟，雖還沒有明目張膽地說是統制，却施行着似是而非的局部管制。各大都市現在已實行配米了，每人的口糧雖祗是十五斤，但總比沒有配給的好。然而米價爲什麼還是跟隨着黑市而調整？當然，這在當局是苦在肚裏，有了美國米在牽制，硬說不准平價賤配，本市縱經市政當局片面決定七月配米定價千萬，較市價已低廉及半，但較六月份配米究已高漲一倍！米價爲百價的領導，升斗小民，別的還不十分躭心，米價却是極大的威脅。中樞當局對這樣關係重大的事情，好像視爲無足重輕，並沒有全力應付，更沒有魄力担當賣任，使之不隨黑市面上漲。政府旣不能穩定米價，如何還侈談穩定其他的物價？其實政府有的是米，徵實征購和美援，數量當不在少，只要在此夏秋靑黃不接之時，硬挺三個月儘可接價不動，米商　有三頭六臂，也決不能對抗握有實物的政府力量。明明告訴米商，說只要黑市漲，配米也會跟着漲，則米商不漲米價才是怪事。主持糧政的人或許要用穀賤傷農的口頭禪來做調整米價的辯護，但是米價穩定，其他物價也可穩定，其他物價穩定了，米價何必使之獨漲？即使有着黑市，把十五斤的配給改爲三十斤的配給，市上有供無求，米價還能上漲嗎？</p>
<p>親到衣，更在政府的掌握中，政府有的是棉花，棉紗，和布疋，除了紗布管理局的政治力量以外，還有中紡公司的實際力量。如果政府不在法幣上打算盤，以二十萬件的棉紗，儘可使本年度內紗價穩定在某一價格而不致劇烈變動，何况棉花和布疋的存量還不計算在內。可惜政府祗以拋售花紗布作爲抽緊銀根的工具，而不以平價供應市塲為穩定市價的手段。我們習見紗布漲到了某一限度以後，中舫便奉命在限度內拋售了若干，一經商人之手，當然又要水漲船高了。如此盤梯般的上升，還不是政府在有意無意中希望漲價，或可多收一些法幣嗎？</p>
<p>住的方面却極穩定，這倒不能不歸功於政府的硬壓手段！因爲住的房屋不在政府配給範圍之內，政府自己又沒有許多房地產業可以計人配屋，而且政府配屋保管使用，收費倒不在限制之列。於是在政府慷業主之慨的條件下，本市房租由於參議會的決議，便釘牢在七千倍與九千倍之間。而生活指數得以壓低許多，外間反多責備參議會議訂房租標準過低之故！即此可見不是政府大量掌握的東西，其價格倒能收着穩定的效果。</p>
<p>至於行，水陸空的運輸工具，無一不需要燃料，而燃料中之煤，柴油，和汽油，又無一不在政府掌握之中，政府說漲就漲，運費票價也祗得跟之俱漲，煤是燃料管理委員會供應的，柴油汽油是細出入管理委頸個中之柴油分配委員會辦理的，在外騰釘　在某一限度之內，煤價油個的調整，實是毫無理由的。但是理由　管毫無，價格還是不得不漲，而且三日一小漲，十天一大漲，漲得水陸空交通事業來不及調整其費率。而且燃料漲了五成，費率即漲八成，人民非行不可，就得看他上漲而繳付高價，貨物非流通不可，就不得不在羊身上生了牟毛·一層層推斷上去，究竟誰在推動漲價？</p>
<p>物價狂漲的原因旣明，政府果眞有大決心平定物價，似乎先該拿出一個穩定的對策。本市地方當局雷厲風行的檢查，登記，取締，懲罰等等，自然應該認眞執行，公平執行，而最要緊的還在中央政府短期內先有一個大決心，就是政府掌握的物寳和事業本身決不領導漲價。政府要把眼光放得遠大，要把法幣計算的利益看得極小。甚而至於應貼補的就貼補，要賠本的就賠本。如果政府無本可賠，那不妨在不急需的建設方面趕緊省些下來來教穩定物價的工作。老實說，現在除了戡亂第一以外，其餘的力量應該完全用出來放到穩定物價上去！物價穩定了纔可侈談經濟建設。這一工作，需要新政府全體動員，而且要刻不容緩的立即動員，旣不是行政各部門爾爲爾我爲我的作風所能奏效，也不是立法委員和監察委員們質詢澈查所能半觀厥成的，至於地方當局之嚴查懲處自然更是一時治標之舉了。</p>

<p>— 陳仲明</p>
<p>——廿六屆國際合作節獻詞——</p>
<p>在世界兩大陣營「冷戰」激烈，世人惴惴然於和平不可久特的今天，全世界一億五千萬個不分種族國別，抱着共同追求人類正義，維護世界和平的合作者，歡欣鼓舞地迎接廿六屆國際合作節，無疑的，是具有劃時代的意義。</p>
<p>遠在百年以前，一八三五年，世界合作運動創始者羅拔奧文，早就在倫敦各國各界聯合會企圖遝用國際合作力量，來消減人類的剝削利戰爭，實現其空想的合作理想，奧文這一世界機構，便是國際合作最原始的形態。</p>
<p>從奧文底各國各界聯合會，演變到國際合作聯盟，今日發展到現階段的全部過程中，國際合作運動的發展，可劃分爲四個階段。</p>
<p>自一九五年國際合作聯盟會成立，到一九〇二年在孟做斯特舉行大會，這是國際合作運動的發展階段，在這一發展階段中，確定了國際合作的理想和方法，主要內容是促使合作運動從狹隘的國家主義和畛域觀念中解放出來，躍進一個沒有種族國別的國際合作聯盟會。這一進步的轉變，從合作共和世界大同的角度來看，由個別的走向集體的，從各個國家走向國際的聯合，無庸否認的，是達成了相當重要的任務。儘管羅虛戴爾在今天怎樣被歷史判定是一條不健全的路綫，但是在資本主義剛抬頭的時候，對於被產業革命的洪濤的冲擊而陷於飢寒交迫的廣大勞苦大衆，羅虛戴爾諸先驅的確是盡了相當有價値的啓蒙工作。在國際合作聯盟會底章程中，有着以次規定：「本會爲繼承羅虛載爾諸先驅底工作計劃，決以獨立的精神，自己的方法，將這一全體社會的利益基於自助互助原則底合作制度，去代替現今私人企業底競爭制度。」這顯然是一句抽象的話，但也足以說明國際合作運動與現存私有制度所存在着矛盾，及其所負的任務。正如國際合作聯盟會已故秘書長梅氏所說一樣：「聯合全世界民衆，增進個人底幸福，同時創造世界底文明，這就是國際合作聯盟會底理想，它要造成一個世界的聯邦，消滅戰爭，避免衝突，創造一個永不見貧富的社　制度，並建立世界底和平。」國際合作運動在這一發展階段的偉大貢獻，是確定了國際合作運　總的路綫目標和任務，但是還沒有指出合作運動對　政治的關聯，與社與制度的依　性，沒有規劃實現國際合作聯、會理想的具體奮鬥方法，把國際合作運動之崇高的理想去和現實配合起來，因之，這一發展階段底國際合作運動，就祗能做到一些合作敎育，和國際合作運動的研究聯系工作。</p>
<p>從一九〇四年舉行大會之後一直到第一次世界大戰爆發的前一年，可以說是國際合作運動底第二個發展階段。這時候，許多進步的合作者，開始注意到合作運動與勞動大衆連鎖的意義，建立了新合作理諭的基礎。瑞士代表穆勒氏主張提醒消費者底勞動大衆連鎖觀念，並促使他們了解合作底目的，不僅在改善自己底生活，而在廢除一切利潤，這一新合作理論的閘揚，對於國際合作運動底發展，的確是起了相當有力的推動作用，構成了這一發展階段的主要特徵，從空想的走到實踐的科學的道路上。</p>
<p>國際合作運動底第三個發展階段，可以說是從半睡眠的停頓狀態中復活。第一次世界大戰開始，直到一九二〇年，由於戰爭的關係，有許多團體退出了聯盟會，以致經常的活動無形停頓至七年之久，可以說是陷於半睡眠狀態中。在這期間，聯盟會雖然通過和平決議案，呼籲和平，但基於聯盟會本身機構的軟弱，這種空想的決議與和平的呼籲，是給戰爭的砲火所融解了。直至一九一六年，法國全國合作聯盟的巴黎會議起到一九二七年國際合作聯盟會，才從半睡眠狀態中復活起來。在這一發展階段的後半期中，値得特別提出的，是在比時甘脫城召開第十一次大會中中央委員會規定，每年七月第一個星期六爲國際合作節，於一九二二年開始，屆時全世界舉行慶祝。這一規定，對於合作者的認識上和國際合作的發展，是起了相當重大的作用，國際合作組織在這期間普遍發展廣大，合作者互相親密地携手起來，合作運動在這一發展階段的後半期中，是以種嶄新的姿態出現，結成一條反資本主義的聯合陣綫，它的最大成功和最大貢獻，不在於這一發展階段的國際合作運動把各國大的產業合作部門由個別的形式轉化到國際的形式，而是這一發展階段的合作運動，由於經過第一次世界大戰的砲火和血肉的洗禮，從戰鬥中長成，在資本主義高度的發展之下，把國際合作運動和廣大的農工勞動大衆建立了更密切的聯繫。國際聯盟根據凡爾賽條約，設立國際勞工局合作部，以謀各國勞工生活的改善，這一新的決定，把合作運動從舊的「純經濟」的窠臼中解放出來，朝着一個新的政治與經濟交流的方向推進，的確是一個進步的轉變</p>
<p>第四個發展階段，自從國際資本主義發生了經濟總危機，演變到法西斯强盜德·日·意·結成了侵略陣營，瘋狂地發動侵略戰爭，同時中·美·英·蘇·爲維護世界和平，結成了反侵略的陣營·在和平破壞之後，用戰爭來消滅戰爭。以求致全世界人類的永久和平與安全合作運動。在這期間，也可以說是在這一發展階段內前半期，是曾經協助各國政府當局挽救經濟危機，迨至法西斯强盜發動侵略戰爭之後，它在侵略陣綫中，無庸否認的也曾被法西斯强盜變質利用，作爲發展其武力經濟的之道。但是在反侵略陣營中的合作運動，却英勇地披上反侵略的戰袍，協助聯合國家，發動民衆，參加對敵經濟作戰的工作，在中國·美國·英國·蘇聯·戰時的合作運動正廣泛地發展起來，担任了反侵略戰爭劃時代的使命，美國的使命，美國的合作者更進一步的召開國際合作會議，通過若干有價値的國際合作運動，培育高級的合作幹部人才，這正意味着國際合作運動的擴展趨勢。我們從國際合作遝動一個世紀的發展史上看來，它已經從原始的空想逐漸轉變到科學的現實的道路上，期望全世界合作者從今天起齊一步調，共同努力，担負起國際合作遝動這一新的發展階段的新任務，以奠定世界人類永久和平的基礎。</p>
<p>第五個發展階段，自第二次世界大戰全面結束後，世界政治經濟起了根本變化，合作事業也隨着掀起了重大的變革，尤其東歐各國採取新的合作路綫，對社會主義建設起了重大的作用，本年九月，國際合作聯盟在捷克首都布拉哈召開戰後第一次會議，對於今後國際合作運動必有劃時代的決策，筆者屆時代表中國前去出席，俟會議結束，當專文報吿。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕蘇聯之正式宣布柏林四强聯合軍政府業已結束，使四十八小時來似已趨於鬆弛的柏林危機，再度進入完全僵持的局面。蘇聯及西方强國在柏林已進入全面的政治與經濟鬥爭，就即時性的後果觀，英美法或將在柏林西區以三强基礎，組織其政治及經濟生活。柏林市府可能分裂爲兩個對立的機構，蘇聯當局或將取締社民黨在柏林東區之活動，而以市政交共黨控制的社會統一黨一手辦理。就遠期的後果言，蘇聯之行動可能更擴大蘇聯與西方强國在外交上的裂痕。在倫敦方面，貝文今日再度接見美法兩國大使，顯示三强對於柏林問題的立塲或將維持不變。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕英發言人頃稱，在未奉倫敦華盛頓巴黎之新指令前，三强不擬就蘇聯之退出柏林四强聯合軍政府採取任何行動，柏林西區的行政，暫時將由英美法柏林司令共同負責。另一英方之書面聲明，力言英軍政府不能承認蘇聯一參謀官之口頤通知，即可結束四國共管柏林的協定。英軍政府仍當繼續遵守盟國政府所簽訂關於四强共管柏林的協定。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕美大使陶格拉斯今晨訪貝文外相，殆係以蘇聯退出柏林聯合軍政府後，美國認爲應由西方三强採取之步驟報告貝文。陶氏昨夜竹接獲華盛頓之指令，渠於訪只文前之一小時·曾參加三强常務委員會之會議，此一委會係由英外部德國司長史屈朗，法大使馬西格里及陶氏合組而成。柏林美軍司令霍萊上校今日曾暗示三强將正式宣布在柏林西區已實施三强管制，倫教及柏林之英發言人則表示認蘇聯退出柏林聯合軍政府之理由爲無效。英外部發言人認柏林局勢之惡化，至堪遺憾，渠指出聯合軍政府之設，係本一九四四年之英美蘇三强協定，不能由一國片面毀棄。此間相信倫敦之三强常務委員會，目前不在準備對蘇直接提出之照會而在考慮應付柏林緊急狀態的切實措施，對蘇之照會在下　　一致提出。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社佛朗克福一日電〕英美法三國駐德總司令今日均出席西區行政長官會議，會議中討論（一）至遲在九月一日選出德制憲議會；（二）改組佔領當局；（三）劃定西德各邦間邊界。會議議程決定後，各行政長官即要求延會，俾得向各該邦政府請示。各行政長官將於七八兩日在柯勃倫茲集會討論盟國之建議。再度與盟軍司令舉行聯席會議之日期尙未確定。</p>
<p>〔路透社佛朗克福一日電〕西德十一邦總理已於今日開始實施西德新憲法之第一階段，彼等以在此間美軍總部晤見三强軍政府長官，接受三强所提關於西德憲政計劃之建議後，已表示決如期於九月一日以前召開制憲議會。克萊將軍向與會谷總理釋明西德憲政計劃之大要，謂制憲議會將起草民主憲法，規定聯邦式的政府機構，其制度應適合德國最後完成全國統一的目標。民主憲法並將保護各邦之權利，及個人之權利及自由。各邦選舉制憲議會代表的程序，得由邦議會自由決定，制憲議會代表之總數，大致將爲每人口七十五萬推選代表一人。憲法經制憲議會草成後，待盟國軍政府長官批准以後，尙須交每邦舉行公民投票公決，如有三分之二以上之邦經多數人民表示同意，即於批准之日起三十天內對各邦發生拘束效力。依據另一佔領法案草案之規定，西德憲政政府成立後，佔領强國軍事長官仍保留下列諾職權，計爲（一）德國外交關係；（二）管制對外貿易，足以影響對外貿易的內政措施，以及德國所得動用資金的適當使用；（三）實施同意的管制權，包括關於魯爾管制政權·賠償·工業水準·廢止軍備及解除武裝·分裂托辣斯組織及科學研究之若干部門等；（四）保障佔領軍之聲譽及安全，及注意其在限度內的需要之得被滿足；（五）保證西德憲法之得被嚴格遵守。除前述保留的權限以外，軍事長官僅於發生威脅安全的緊急狀態時，始得行使其充份的職權。克萊並特別指出佔領原有基本目標之一，即使德國民主化之點並未列在軍事長官的保留權限內。關於此點，盟國軍事長官，祗負對德當局視察·協助·及提供意見之責。</p>

<p>— 翁紹裘寄自紐約</p>
<p>—是美國的隱憂—</p>
<p>美國巨額金元，流過大西洋和太平洋，援助各國復原，現在却發現自己的毗鄰紊亂無序。際茲美國致力於援歐，拉丁美洲的不安狀態已日益顯露。</p>
<p>拉丁美洲的安全，與歐亞兩洲的安全同屬重要，美國當然關懷。數月前哥倫比亞京城波哥大的大規模流血事件，便是拉丁美洲不安的一例。中美洲哥斯達黎加的政治叛亂，已喪失了一批人命的智利及巴西亦有怠工趨勢，瓜地瑪拉也已洩露革命的計謀。</p>
<p>拉丁美洲的安全，與歐亞兩洲的安全同屬重要，美國當然關懷。數月前哥倫比亞京城波哥大的大規模流血事件，便是拉丁美洲不安的一例。中美洲哥斯達黎加的政治叛亂，已喪失了一批人命。智利及巴西亦有怠工趨勢，瓜地瑪拉也已洩露革命的計謀。</p>
<p>美國要使拉丁美洲安定，將拋出更多的金元，但問題是美國的金元，能否及時消弭目前的不安。</p>
<p>拉丁美洲不安定的基本原因，是工資低落與物價上漲。人民生活水準本來已很低，現在加上通貨膨脹，使生活更加降低，反對派及共黨便把握這種情勢，儘可能製造災難。</p>
<p>各國困難的情况不一，但是通貨膨脹最嚴重的國家，困難也最多。政府力量薄弱，反之共黨力世則漸呈雄厚。</p>
<p>現將拉丁美洲各國的現况分析如下：</p>
<p>巴西人口四千七百萬，大部分人民無力購買生活必需品，目前的生活費，比一九四〇年增加三倍。巴西工業大部份爲織造工業及其他輕工業，但重工業已開始經營。出口貨物中以土產爲主，巴西輸往各國的咖啡，在世界上佔第一位。杜屈拉總統所領導的政府是民生政府。</p>
<p>巴西共產黨號約十五萬人，最近被政府宣佈爲非法組織，該黨現從事於地下運動，黨負正進行怠工運動。</p>
<p>巴西於一九三〇年會發生革命，結果是形成伐爾加斯的獨裁地位，以後才被推翻。目前巴西不致發生革命，伐爾斯必須與共黨合作，及獲得一部份陸軍的贊助，才能發動革命。但共產黨仍將製造其他的災難。</p>
<p>巴拉圭人口一百萬，農民仍度着原始時代的農民生活。巴拉圭共產黨員約八千人，使總統蒙尼哥感到不安。巴拉圭政府是獨裁制度，去年巴拉圭曾發生革命，幾乎成功。今後巴拉圭將隨時發生革命，一旦革命成功，蒙尼哥總統心目中的繼承人康查爾芝恐無法繼總統，康氏準備於八月十五日繼任總統。</p>
<p>智利是世界上硝石及銅出口最大宗的國家，全國人口六百萬，目前正遭受通貨膨脹的威脅。智利工業大部份是輕工業，但政府正從事建設鋼廠，同時發展森林及漁業。貝蒂拉總統所領導的政府是民主政府。共產黨員約五萬人，政府企圖分散共黨力量，制止怠工及罷工。</p>
<p>十五年前智利曾發生革命，目前除非共黨獲得陸軍或國家警察的贊助，不致發生革命，但怠工及暴動事件隨時可能發生。</p>
<p>玻璃維亞玻國的經濟合脈是輸出金屬品，主要金屬是錫礦。全國人口四百萬人，人民生活水準，可說是西半球各國中最低者，現在也發生通貨膨脹。政治方面，希特卓格總統所領導的政府是民主政府，共產黨力量脆弱。一九四六年曾發生革命，以後沒有嚴重的政治威脅，短期間內如錫礦市塲衰落時，可能發生革命。</p>
<p>秘魯秘國總統路易斯所領導的政府最初是民主政府，但以後因為不斷發生政治謀殺事件，總統宣佈解散國會。</p>
<p>秘魯人民八百萬，因爲物價上漲，生活費比戰前高出三倍。工業上主要出產爲金屬品及輕工業。</p>
<p>秘魯共黨黨員號稱三萬五千人，但實際力量不大，一九三三年曾發生革命。目前沒有革命趨勢，但反對黨的力量甚大，隨時有發生革命的可能。</p>
<p>厄瓜多爾（又稱赤道國）過去二十年間，厄國有過十五任總統及數任臨時政府。現任總統亞羅斯孟那有意組織民主行政機構，但政府內部不健全。</p>
<p>厄瓜多爾人口三百三十萬人，大部份人民從事耕作及畜牧，共產黨黨員二千五百人。（上）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市政當局爲預防今日市塲開關後物價猛漲起見，特由吳市長·潘議長·宣司令·社會局吳局長等，於昨午五時，在市府會議室聯合召集本市各同業公會代表舉行談話會，並經訂定四項緊急措置如下：（一）禁止游資運滬，今後對飛機·輪船·火車之旅客携帶現鈔，嚴格限制不得超過二億元，對機關部隊經運鈔票，亦動員軍警憲嚴查，超限者概令存入中央銀行，動用時須查明用途。（二）嚴密檢查各倉庫，私人倉庫限於本月六日前向社會局登記物資，逾期查封嚴辦。（三）日用必需品之成交，必須確切登記。（四）嚴格取締「踢皮球」，請各同業公會各自訂定制止辦法，並由社會局訂管制棧單辦法。</p>
<p>昨午出席之各業代表，計有市商會徐寄廎，葛傑臣，國營招商局徐學禹，新藥業史致富，中大公司郭琳爽，黃祖康，蕭宗俊，紙業詹沛霖，人造絲業裴元鼎，煤業葉晋榮，百貨業張文魁，雜糧業單文俊，糖業陳庭芳，錢業沈日新，進出口業馬仲達，倉庫業張寒柏，棉業董允蜂，麵粉業榮毅仁，紡織業汪竹一，米業瞿振華，油業張超，中國植物油廠李廷棟，猪肉業洪文江，蔬菜業馬文彪等四十餘人。席間吳市長，宣司令，潘議長均相繼發表意見，語多透澈沉痛，徐學禹及駱淸華等亦各有意見發表。茲摘要錄如下：</p>
<p>吳市長：前數日來物價狂漲驚人，當局爲防止銀行開業後物價波動起見，今召集各業代表共同商討對策。物價上漲由於通貨膨脹，政府決不否認，惟通貨膨脹率決無物價暴漲之烈，若不設法抑止，必將威脅民生與治安，一旦發生問題時，首當其衝者即爲各位。本人今日曾赴警備司令部與各軍事首長共商決策，今後對軍用機塲及各軍事機關之現鈔運輸，一律嚴加檢查。本人相信只要平穩渡過七月，八月中即可望運用美援，則物價情形即可好轉，故政府此番對管制物價是下了最大決心，務希各業赤誠合作，羣策羣力，共渡此最困難之短期。</p>
<h3 id="c69">決以人爲辦法　制裁人爲漲風 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>宣司令：照過去十天物價狂跳的情形看來，上海猶如一座火山，吳市長及本人曾數度請辭以桃避火山之爆發，惟在任一日，必力謀挽救。目前頗足憂慮者，乃一般人民對於商人已有一種對立心理，一致認爲商人多囤積操縱，剝削人民生存權利。這種對立陣綫之形成，前途實未可忽視。本人相信用不正當手段擾亂金融者，乃少數商人，多數正當商人均願盡全力以挽救自身危機。此次物價漲風顯有人爲的因素，故當局決同樣以人爲的辦法，予以制裁。</p>
<p>宣司令後又特加補充稱：對今日這種局面焦急者，不僅應爲政府當局，而應爲各位，因爲目前本市警備力量固足以防止共匪一切匿跡及活動，然對人民因生計困難，被迫有越軌行動時，則實無法加以制止。屆時，吳市長與本人大不了受拘禁或撤職查辦，而各位之身家，性命，財產，事業，均將毀於一且，故望及時自救救人。</p>
<p>最大關鍵在執行者</p>
<p>潘議長：前數日上海物價之瘋狂暴漲，足以驚人，在中央尙未有具體辦法公佈前，市政當局必須先行設法抑平，否則上海即可能形成大混亂。日前英文大美晚報社論表示：「若市府再不拿出辦法來，則不必等共匪攻來，上海即將垮台。」局勢如是危急，希望市府與人民趕速合作，共渡難關。凡政策之實踐，必須兩者眞誠合作，才能貫澈，故本人願率直地說，最大關鍵，在於執行的人，如執行者不能公正，則再好的政策亦將變質。目今吾等均生活在火山之上，必須在其未爆裂前及時挽救，望政府所指派之執行者，均先對天立哲，誠心誠意爲國家盡全力，決不貪汚，則不致給工商界一個藉口。而同時本人要墾求工商界人士，千萬不要引誘執行者。</p>
<p>軍餉有無空額　曾否搶購物資</p>
<p>對於本市物價之狂漲，一般皆認爲游資作祟，且多數人　表示多半游資運自軍隊，據稱有整箱鈔票運往前方發餉，而結果又裝回來搶購物資。這種傳說吾等當不能輕易相信，但商人亦決不願有這種情形存在，今後如獲得這種消息時，可立即報吿主管當局，我們主張萬一若有查獲時，必須嚴辦，應槍斃幾個人以謝國人，現時我國最大的開支在軍餉，但許多軍餉却爲空額，我們要澈查這些空額，若竟有軍餉回到市塲來，我們必須予以最嚴正的制裁！</p>
<p>政府抑平無價　應先以身作則</p>
<p>徐學禹：招商局來自平津之班船，發現大批單帮，每人携帶法幣二億元，即可賺匯水六千萬元，其所帶者旣未超過政府之規定，則應如何阻止，請當局設法。關於抑平物價，政府應先以身作則，燃管會謀價明起（三日）將漲百分之一百六十，柴油十天中已從四千六百萬漲至九千餘萬，四日起又將漲百分之四十五，如政府自己所管制之物項先漲，則何苛求民營之不漲。人生衣食住行四項，政府管制者佔衣食行三項，而結果漲得最爲劇烈。故本人認爲要謀抑平物價，首先要求政府所管制者不准漲！</p>
<p>工商忍痛犧牲　必須政府領導</p>
<p>駱淸華：本人願貢獻原則上之意見，認爲一旦中國經濟崩潰，則搶·打·殺·燒·無所不用其極，其時首當其衝者厥爲工商界，故工商界應興政府相依爲命。市長認爲只要平穩渡過七月，</p>
<p>以後即可望好轉，則此一短期中，吾等必須忍痛犧牲，赤誠合作，然却須要求政府領導率先，政府須先以身作則，抱定犧牲決心，商人始可隨之。</p>
<p>最後由吳市長分別詢問各業之交易登記及物資申請情形後，會議至七時許始散。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕勝利迄今，將近三年，惟中日閒通商仍未開始，但以日貨在我市上頗有利可圖，致一般喪心病狂之徒，竟不惜勾結日人，從事走私，近發現有一名盛瑜者，勾串一僑居上海已有卅年之日僑吉井睦祐，利用日船日星丸，偸運大批海貨來滬，詎事機不密，終爲國防部保密局偵悉破案。</p>
<p>吉井睦祐係日本福山縣人，現年五十五歲，在滬居住已三十餘年，抗戰期間，曾歷在山西作開礦工作，且在天津經營木柴生意，在滬任敵「東亞科學研究會會長」及「國際親善協會理事長」等職。勝利後以對日工作委員會委員名義留用在滬，詎竟與抗戰期間即行相識之國人盛瑜，互相勾結，雙方設法凑得資金法幣一億二千萬元，於卅六年三月間，先由吉井買得美國糖精一批送至日星丸運日，旋又於四月間由吉井自日本走私運來鋼針十餘箱，交與盛瑜及另一劉姓轉交江寗路光明邨十一號宋保生代售，得款六千餘萬元。其後吉井又稱有日本漁船兩艘，用其實業公司名義，已駛進黃浦江，願在中國境內捕魚，並帶來魚一百箱，旋劉姓及吉井擬分向各漁業公司交涉，但又均不敢出面，且海關不准停留，隔日又駛返日本。據吉井供稱：糖精共値五億元，一部份係朱某所有，至運來私貨除鋼針外，尙有大宗海參，魚翅，係由上野，松原兩日人運來交日人妹尾轉交盛·劉等出售者。</p>
<p>同時盛某在滬設有一福民公司，其中亦曾查獲單據賬册十二紙，均證明盛等經常與吉井等日人有款往來，且互相勾結，大事走私。</p>
<p>此案經保密局奉令移送地檢處訊辦，現地撿處已依懲治偷漏關稅暫行條例，以偸漏關稅，勾結外人罪，對吉井睦祐及盛瑜二人提起公訴。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕百業凋零聲中，文化出版事業尤其陷於嚴重之境地。書業公會理事長李伯嘉昨告記者稱；今日出版業面臨之問題，已非賺錢或蝕本問題，亦非售書收入能否補進紙張之問題。遠甚於此者，出版業之困境已達於每月營業收入不足支付薪工一項之地步。如六月份印工增加兩次，白報紙漲價三倍以上，而書價則不能比例提高。蓋在此大多數人民衣食不週之際，對於書本之購買力已降低至於極點，任何一本書籍鮮有銷至一千册以上者。最近商務印書館出售廉價書，售價較白報紙猶低，而購者依舊寥寥無幾，文化前途至堪憂慮。現規模較小之書店，大都不出新書，以淸售舊書維持，大書店如商務中華世界等出版新書，亦大爲减少。各書店賴爲主要收入之敎科書營業，上半年亦並不甚佳，因交通困難，運輸阻滯，如預定銷售東北之一批敎科書至今猶堆存北平，無法北運，因之資金無法週轉，損失甚大。又如最近開封戰事，大批敎科書毀於炮火，損失尤屬不貲。設長此以往，書業前途不堪設想云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會頃代電立法院，請暫緩討論財產稅案，電文內容如次：南京立法院院長孫副院長陳鈞鑒，幷轉全體立法委員諸公勛　：查鈞院劉委員不同等四十九人以我國經八年抗戰，少數人憑藉通貨膨脹之機緣，無限制累積其財富，造成貧富趨向兩極之現象，而此等累積財富之人，對國家則毫無負擔·方今戰亂擴大，國本垂危之際，厥在如何使此等有錢者厲正出錢，藉以平均社會財富之分配，及應建國之需要。爰本斯旨，提議立即開征臨時財產稅，並經擬具條例草案，提由鈞院交付審查之中。竊以劉委員等所持征收財產稅之理由，辭嚴義正，本會同人無不欽遲。</p>
<p>果若實施　難免紛擾</p>
<p>但細按鈞院現正審查之財產稅法案內容，其立法之主義，包括屬人屬地，其征收之對象，包含個人法人，其征收之範圍，遍及土地房屋設備，汽車輪船貨物，其起征數額，低至戰前五萬元，其征收我率，自百分之五至百分之五十或六十·果若通過實施，誠恐全國騷然，正當生產享業無由生存，成效未見，而弊寳叢脞，請申述理由如左：</p>
<p>（一）條例草案規定中華民國人民在國外，非中華民國人民在國內，所有不動產及動產，一律征收，條文非不公平而美觀，事實上何能做到。國人在國外之財產，隱匿姓名，託庇外人，被輩神通廣大，手段高明，假使可以依例征收，則過去動用國外存款工作，當可早已做到。本案原提案人劉委員不同曁現任財政部王部長雲五等，均親任督導救濟特捐，諒可深知其困難，以昔例今，成效可睹。至外人在國內之財產，如果征收，不論在外交方面有無問題，而一面歡迎外資來華協助生產，一面反竟有課征重稅之舉措，豈非南轅北轍，背道而馳？</p>
<p>眞正財富　逃避國外</p>
<p>（二）條例草案規定，自然人及法人之財產，皆須同例征課。似此情形，則眞正豪富，因資產已逃至國外，託庇外人，不慮被征，即在國內者，亦以所藏者爲黃金外幣，以及其他動產，隱匿甚易，若以吾國數年來辦理遺產稅之成效爲例，即可知在全國財產登記制度未臻完善之際，對自然人之動產征課財產稅，顯屬跡近夢囈。惟有經營工商業者，所存之貨物般備機器廠屋輪船車輛，衆目昭彰，無可掩飾，不得不據實申報，依例納我。而論其實際經濟狀况，則在通貨膨賬之現狀下，生產工具旣不能變賣抵押，貨物原料亦在逐漸减少，且工資昻貴，稅捐苛重，購買力薄弱之際，每日均在張羅頭寸，借貸維持，然核估其資產，則又動輒數百千億，誠如現定稅率，加以重征，勢必變賣貨物原料，將平日所賴以周轉運用者，大半繳納國庫，猶感不足，變產之後，繼以破產，行見一切生產事業，一網打盡，千萬職工，皆吿失業。</p>
<p>人人皆成　征收對象</p>
<p>（三）尤屬危險者，以目前通貨膨脹之速度，再過數月，一普通中產階級所有之財產總額，亦將超過三百億元。換言之，勢必人人皆成征收之對象，更因獎勵吿密，成則有百分之三十獎勵金可得，不成則並不負虛誣反坐之責。當此政治風紀陵夷，社會道德墮落之際，焉得而不引起紛擾之局面，喪失一般之民心。</p>
<p>（四）資金逃避遠至國外，近至香港，政府正在力加防堵，豈可推波助瀾。財產稅如須征收，勢必更造成資本之大逃避，大者高飛遠走，少者投機金鈔，正當生產事業，再無人投資經營，如此推演，將成何種景象。近一個月來外匯黑市及物價之暴漲，即坐此故。</p>
<p>政府課稅　應求不虐</p>
<p>本會認爲法律之訂頒，當以合乎民情爲前提，政府之課稅，亦應以取而不虐爲限度。若鈞院現正審查之財產稅法案者，即以上述諸端，已可喻其弊害至大。而况我國辦理所利得稅，實行十餘年之久，猶未敢以個人綜合所得爲征課對象，營利事業所得稅，至今尙實行簡化稽征辦法，米能依稅法而翔實抽征，今對新創之財產稅，忽毅然作此大膽之嘗試，寗有不歸於失敗之理，縱使政府對於實行財產稅已深具決心，則全國二千餘大小縣市，四億五千萬同胞之財產，外加各種法人，其財產之調查鑑估，恐非三年而莫辦（引直接稅署王署長撫洲之言）緩不濟急，亦在意料之中，何能應目前戡亂之急需？竊按劉委員不同等提案之初衷，無非在淸算憑藉權勢，累積私人財產之少數豪富，征收其巧取豪奪之所有，作爲平均社會財富，抱注國家財政之需，如果信焉不謬，則制訂法案，當集中精力，專以淸算少數豪富爲入手，蓋如何而使資金不再逃避，如何而使逃避之資金，轉而充實國用，更如何而使國內基礎脆弱之生產事業，不因此而加速其破產，庶幾爲鈞院諸公當務之急。本會以上海地方，忝居全國工商業集中之大埠，國課負担佔全國百分之五十以上，見聞比較周祥，舉止尤關輕重，茲適値本會第六次大會開會之際，對于鈞院在此時議征臨時財產稅一舉，認爲轉不如改以專志淸查豪富資產爲簡捷。且鈞院已另有淸查豪門資產委員會之組設，如果加緊工作，悉力以赴，當可致鉅效，收急功，快人心而紓國難。爰經數日來愼重研討，決議：「建議鈞院，迅速另訂征收豪富捐法案，交由政府切實執行，或督促政府，加强推行救濟特捐，以裕國庫，而應戡亂急需，對于現正審查之征收臨時財產稅法案，征收方法，未盡妥善，實行結果，必致引起紛擾，妨碍正當生產事業，莫此爲甚，應請從緩付議，以安人心」，等語在案，綜其理由，已如上述。夙仰鈞院諸公，皆屬來自民間，代表全民意識，定能傾聽下情，俯賜採納者也。愚者千慮，容有一得，剴切電陳，惟希鑒察，爲幸。</p>

<p>李雲良發表　航海節感想</p>
<p>中華民國輪船商業同業公會全國聯合會秘書長李雲良，對中國航海節發表感想，略稱：我國沿海和內河航行權，被侵害達一世紀。一九四二年不平等條約取消，航權收回。然仍有人不知航權爲何事，甚至以此爲航商之事，與人民無關。更有人發爲「運輸事大，主權事小」之謬論。我國現階段之航業，經營殊感因難，而尤以客船爲甚，無票乘客之多，維持秩序之難，雖執行稽查之軍警亦感棘手。値此首次航海節，吾人希望喚起政府與人民對航業之實視，在此節日，不僅學美國航海節之儀式，更須學其在造船上突飛猛晋之精神。</p>

<h3 id="c96">「我是勞動英雄」　吳滿有被俘前後 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張僊洲</p>
<p>〔本報西安廿八日航訊〕陝北「解放區」中，吳滿有幾乎是無人不知，這個會耕善做的老頭子，被共匪捧成「紅人」，「勞動英雄」的名堂，使他付出了更多的苦力。</p>
<p>在一個月前，他隱瞞着自己的行跡，說他呌王希成，可是當這次記者再見他時，那個老人自己一開口就說：「我是勞動英雄吳滿有，怕啥咧！」當他走進房子的時候，滿頭大汗·在大家的謙遜當中；他脫去了看起怪不合身的軍官服裝，手裏拿着一條紅手帕，揩着汗水。軍官服，紅手帕和那個穿慣農民衣服的人配在一起，顯出一副有趣的畫面。</p>
<p>吳滿有在「愛國靑年訓練隊」中，現在也是特殊人物，他和區隊長同住一室，同桌吃飯，聽說現在預備每月按上尉階級的薪水給他。同時，在戰俘中，正找尋他嫡親的侄子，想使他們團圓的住在一起，據他自己說，在前兩天的坦白大會中，曾看見那「娃兒」，的確也在那裏。</p>
<p>滿口新名詞</p>
<p>談起了他的身世，這個風趣的老頭子，除了爽朗以外，不禁興起了感慨，半生滄桑，一身辛苦，如果重提舊話，這情緒是免不了的。他說得一口陝北腔，聲音很宏亮，「生產」，「同志」！那些新名詞滿口都是。他說；</p>
<p>「咱的老家是橫山，住在石灣鎭楊台村，底兒還算厚，種百多垧地（陝北地畝以垧計算，每垧約三畝地）。十七年，陝北是大年經（荒年），家裏混不住咧，我帶着婆姨和娃逃到延安，在延安以南的吳家棗園，佃了些地種，咱是下苦人麼。地，只要你捨力，總是會多打糧食的，就這樣混了幾年，地裏生產的不少，雖然老財剝削，日子慢慢好咧。」</p>
<p>在延安落業</p>
<p>「原先我想年歲」好，再回橫山去，後來在延安混的差不多，老家的地也被別人種了，我了一看，回去做X呢？人家要分地，咳了一口氣，把老業撇咧，安心一意在延安落業。十九年我死了婆姨，那時候我還窮的很，沒錢買藥，硬把人担擱死了。」</p>
<p>一提到「生產」或是「勞動」這些事，吳滿有馬上有了精神，從他臉上的縐紋當中，可以看出他的神經受到了鼓舞，同時在年代時間上，也換成了「四一」這些字眼來作記號。</p>
<p>「咱是受過窮的人，咱懂得窮人的苦處嚒，因此我常把餘糧借給大家，不加利，不剝削。陝北的糧食小米爲上，只要咱生產下，自己用不完，你就借去，怕啥咧。抗戰以後，有好多難民逃到陝北，河南的，山西的，山東的，河北的，咱是對誰都一模一樣，大家合得來，他們蓋房修莊，咱去給做上兩天，他們就說我團結窮人團結的好，咱的莊稼做得細緻些，他們都說咱會生產。</p>
<p>第一名英雄</p>
<p>四一年「邊區」要選舉「勞動英雄」，層層調查，報到上面去，我是第一。四二年五月一日，我當了「勞動英雄」，當時咱還害怕，不知道「勞動英雄」是弄啥哩，後來開了歡迎會，全「邊區」共有五個人當選「英雄」，我是頭一名。「邊區政府」給咱賞了一個鐝頭兩個鋤，我收下了，回去還是做咱個莊稼，努力增產。</p>
<p>在一九四三年，吳滿有當選爲延安市參議員，當記者去年上延安時，曾在參議會中看見他的畫像與朱毛共懸壁上，在參議會的紀錄，他的提案都被認爲是重要決議，像「耕三餘一」，「變工隊一「精耕細作」……等等，在一增產」的過程中，都被共匪引作口號。現在，和他再談到這些，他都還記得淸楚，甚至連年月都記得，尤其是談到他提案中的「母馬不支長伕案。」他笑着說：「因爲母馬有駒，支長給馬吃不好，把馬駒子也弄瞎咧，我提這案子完全是爲老百姓想的，咱是老百姓，咱當然愛老百姓，對公家我不說，對老百姓我可眞出力呢！」</p>
<p>在邠州被捕</p>
<p>「去年十二月，我參加了兵站，被撥到二縱隊當的衛生部工作，後來撥到第六縱隊當担架隊的副隊長，球！怕啥哩，一勞動英雄」都當了，就當副隊長吧！一共帶二百多民伕，到石堡，出黃龍山，在邠州被俘過來咧！」</p>
<p>吳滿有兩個「小子」，大的呌吳忠富，廿五歲，現在延安家中做莊稼，小的今年廿歲，呌忠國，前年個參軍了，起初當戰鬥員，後來當「測繪員」，吳滿有說：「小的唸過兩天書。」談起他們，雖然他口中說：「不想他們咧，想着：「球」呢，他們都娶了婆姨，抱了兩個女孩子咧，有啥想頭！」可是從他的臉上可以看出舐犢情深，這個老頭子還在深深的懷念着關山遠隔的兒子。</p>
<p>不要老婆姨</p>
<p>記者問題對關中的人民生活感想，他馬上讚美起來，「這兒，好嗎，地比陝北好土色不錯，人呢，也自由自便，說話沒啥顧慮，在陝北，有關係的話　，就要看對象。其實，公家也不打不罵，就是要『整風』就壞了！」至於未來，吳滿有說：「只要有土地，怕啥！我給政府可勞動！」旁邊有個敎官說給他物色一個老婆，可以在關中成家立業，他又馬上笑着嚷：「不要，不要，都五十五歲的人咧，還要婆姨？」</p>
<p>專家李若海</p>
<p>管理青訓總隊的李若海將軍，可以說是訓練共匪的專家，他從軍校四期畢業，過去在西安「勞動營」就着手感化工作，至今十幾年了，長久的年代使他的生活經騐加多。他對記者談及他的經騐時，只說一個是「耐心」，一個是「理智」。只要能說服他們，道理只有一個。至於隊員的出路，據他說，近兩年的紀錄是百分之八十以上撥交國軍，槍口對外，讓他們在戰塲上去贖罪，較高級的人員，經感化後，或送資遺散，或是在後方斟酌情形分配工作。</p>
<p>自稱王希成</p>
<p>關於吳滿有被發現的事，是很有趣的，靑訓隊的敎官在隊員剛收進的個別談話時，吳滿有自稱呌王希成，洛川人是民伕隊一個班長，可是從他的神氣上看，那些敎官判斷他絕不是班長，可能是一個中級「基幹」，後來有些老隊員跑來報吿稱，看樣子那是「英雄」吳滿有。經過幾次談話，他還是躲閃含糊，直到六月初，他才被隊中的生活感化得自動的從共匪的宣傳印象中解放出來，他承認了一切！</p>
<p>胡宗南將軍是在六月四日晚上，把他召到西安綏署的駐在地小雁塔去，可是吳滿有又不承認他是，又說他是班長王希成，胡將軍對這並不深究，但是等他剛退出房子，胡先生就吿訴綏署的高級屬僚，說那就是吳滿有，因爲他一坐在沙發上，就架起了腿，態度自若，相當鎭靜，這工夫絕不會是一個班長所能有的態度。現在，當大家說起這些話時，這老頭羞紅了臉，赧然的笑着說：「我眞太頑皮了。」</p>
<p>嘹喨的號召</p>
<p>吳滿有從一個地主到一個佃戶，再變成「英雄」而至現在，他的路是漫長而曲折，是多風多雨，共匪以榮譽·鐝鋤·一頭牛……，把他捧成偶像，利用他的號召每年從陝北順利的徵出十六萬石至廿萬石的「救國公糧」。現在，這個單純的鄕下佬又被國軍的寬大與物質享受，而感動了，西安綏署除了邀他講演以外，並且預備給他印小册子。六月十五日在全隊的「坦白大會」上，他呼籲大家拿出良心，暴露身份……」他的聲音在靑訓隊中，又成了響亮的號召。</p>
<p>從吳滿有來看這個年代，來看國軍感化工作的成就，不是很好的鏡子嗎？</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃自此間泛美航空公司辦事處獲悉：英國文壇怪傑蕭伯納最近義務爲該公司自美至愛爾蘭航綫修正廣吿一篇，此爲蕭氏有生以來第一次與商業界合作，泛美公司引爲無上之光榮。該廣吿內容係介糾愛爾蘭之風光，其中蕭伯納親撰文字如下：</p>

<p>愛爾蘭之空氣與衆不同，</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　黃潮如</p>
<p>〔本報長沙一日航訊〕南縣位於洞庭湖的中心，直徑不及百里，全縣耕種面積約八十餘萬畝，人口約二十八萬多。在濱湖，算是最小而且歷史最短的一縣，全縣都是垸田，沒有一塊高地，雖沒有名山碧水，可是每到春夏之交，兩岸垂楊和垸中的禾苗，把整個南縣，化裝成一個美麗的綠色世界，一到初秋，就只見遍地黃金，倉廩鹽實，所以外人皆以「糧倉」呼之。</p>
<p>二十年前盛極一時</p>
<p>在二十餘年前，南縣的確曾經盛極一時，因爲那時所有垸田，都是新淤的洲土，土質肥沃，加以地勢較高，水災威脅也較少，所以出產非常豐富。主要爲穀，棉，其餘各種雜糧也出產不少。因爲糧產多的關係，附業如猪·羊·鷄·鴨等類畜收事業，也相當發達。此外，還有一個面積很大的大通湖——洞庭內湖，每年要產魚十萬担左右。魚米之鄉的雅號，就這樣冠在南縣的頭上了。</p>
<p>只庶羊肥不怕擠乳</p>
<p>南縣雖然是個很小的縣份，可是她在八年抗戰和三年戡亂的長時期內，對國家民族實盡了很大的貢獻。自從開始實行征兵制以來，從沒有欠過兵額，田賦負担特重每年的征實征購，數達六十餘萬石之鉅，佔湖南全省十三分之一，較廣西一省還多。南縣人爲着田賦的負担，眞有些喘不過氣來，不過，他們始終忍受着，咬緊牙，等待老天的慈悲，給他們鹽收，也就是等於羊奶儘管你擠，只要羊能長得肥，假使沒有充足的營養食料給羊吃，只是一點枯草給牠充饑，還要在牠身上擠奶，那麽，這隻羊就只好瘦死了。</p>
<p>被淹田畝與年俱增</p>
<p>南縣河流交錯，以前可稱灌溉便利，近年來以江水挾泥沙直下，河床逐漸淤高，垸內地勢，就日漸低窪，於是被漬水淹沒的田畝，也一年多一年了。過去，此地三度淪陷敵手，加以負祖過重的影響，元氣喪盡，無力興修水利，雖然曾向政府再三呼籲，請求給這售羊一點鮮草食料，予以救濟，無如羊雖聲嘶力竭，而聽者並無動於中，所以現在南縣的垸田，完全靠天吃飯，遇春旱則無水揷秧，遇夏雨則盡成澤國，並不是過去那水旱無憂的糧倉了。</p>
<p>垸內積水無法排洩</p>
<p>今年入春以來，霪雨連月，垸內漬水，無法排洩，田地屋基，都成了一片汪洋，浮家泛宅，情况異常悽慘。今年這裏不僅水災，還遭受了空前的風災，災區遼闊，損失慘重，可憐幸逃活命的老百姓，現在都是蓋藏早無，十室九空，據縣府統計的漬風雨災的損失，被災面積達五十六萬畝以上，被災人數有十五萬餘，風災損毀，漬災倒坍的房屋，達七千九百餘棟，沉沒翻損的船隻一百六十八隻。</p>
<p>上游山洪爆發堪虞</p>
<p>現在霪雨雖止，漬水依然無法排除，晚稻依然無法補種，而且有一個更可憂慮的事爲人人所躭心的，上次春雨爲災，上游山洪尙未暴發，以去冬積雪之厚的情形來說，到此夏季，可能尙有一次山洪之災，如不幸再繼以山洪暴發成災，則此洞庭湖中的糧倉，將有被整個毀滅的危險。中國老百姓什麼都靠菩蕨保佑，除此以外似乎就束手無策，現在濱湖的農民都在燒香祈禱，不會再有洪災。然而，菩薩究竟是渺茫的玩兒，靈騐與否，眞是只有「天知道！」</p>

<h3 id="c109">本月煤斤配價 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>正審核中定五日公佈</p>
<p>據悉：本月份煤斤配價，因礦地物價暴漲，勢須增加。例如六月份麵粉，較五月份漲百分之三十五，五金材料及窑木，均須外匯購得，而外匯掛牌與結匯證明書成交價之和，又須二百四十餘萬，運輸費用，約增加百分之卅五，其他一切雜費約增加百分之二十，而一部份工資按照生活指數計算，又須增加百分之一百。</p>
<p>茲據燃管會表示：按照以上各項之上漲率，計算本月份配煤價格，至少須增加百分之一百五十，上月份配價為一千二百五十五萬元，即增加一倍半，亦較目前煤斤黑市便宜一半。至該會對本市煤斤之供應來源，決可無虞匱乏，惟本月份各項煤斤配價，現尙在審核中，五日始可正式公佈。</p>

<p>〔本報華盛頓航訊〕美國桐油輸入，以我國為主要來源，而我國桐油輸出，亦以美國為主要對象。去年所得外匯，約達美金三千餘萬元。前以美國桐油價格大落，該國桐油生產業公會，以為此係我國桐油向美傾銷之故，正式向美政府請求對我國桐油徵收反傾銷稅以資抵制。此事果成事實，則我國桐油出口，所受影響至大。即美海關對我輸入桐油，令繳保證金，亦已使我桐油輸出額减少不少。我國政府及桐油輸出商方面，對此甚形佳焦慮。我國駐美商務參事處，亦以此事關係重大，特向美國外財農商各部分別交涉或解釋，唯此事牽涉問題甚多，除價格外，並與美國黨派競選有關。該處一面向美政府交涉，一面聯絡反對徵稅之桐油銷費者，一面更請反對徵稅之議員，運用其政治手腕，從旁協助。現悉美政府已駁回此項反傾銷之請求，並取消海關前此對我桐油輸入索取保證金之辦法云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中菲棒球聯歡賽，昨日下午三時在跑馬廳內舉行，駡尼刺紅襪隊於數百中外名流之注視下，以五比〇戰勝地主中華隊。賽前中華隊致贈錦旗，以留紀念。吳市長因公不能出席，改由市府交際科長張彼得代表，將球擲與菲列賓副總領事迦西亞，表示對體育大使之歡迎。</p>
<p>神出鬼沒紅襪得分</p>
<p>戰幕隨張彼得與迦西亞之一擲一接而展開。中華禮讓，客軍先攻，雷夢杜先以短打上壘，更藉雷德之安全打進至二壘，帕勒　斯擊出極峻急低球，被游擊梁友聲以美絕之身手接獲，急投二壘，再轉一壘，演成雙殺。惟雷夢杜乘捕手何金本之錯誤，偷得一分。中華反攻，紅襪A·奧西尼之投球，左旋右旋，神出鬼沒，不可揣測，惟梁文義·何金貴·梁友文均能勉力擊出，惜失之過軟，未有收獲。二·三·四局，雙方禁衛森嚴，各無上壘機會。</p>
<p>二比零</p>
<p>第五局紅襪小奧西尼以安全打上壘，勒摩士擎出二壘打，小奧西尼撥衝回本壘，被何氏昆仲以閃電式手法刺殺。A·奧西尼出擊，勒糜士　機襲得一分，成二對〇。中華梁友聲，鮑觀達先後出局，何金本雖乘菲方技術犯規而淮一至三壘，得分之望，仍因俞長　之被三投擲殺，而成畫餅。</p>
<p>第六局雷德被俞長鑾投殺，帕勒喬斯被鍾保羅接殺，羅沙被梁友聲追迫刺殺，中華三上三落。</p>
<p>連失三分</p>
<p>最後一局，中華守衛微見鬆弛，先後被古盎卡，勒摩士，小奧西尼通得三分，反攻又未得手，遂以〇比五敗北。各局戰績如后：</p>
<p>紅襪</p>
<p>局次</p>
<p>中華</p>
<p>一〇〇〇一〇三</p>
<p>（一）（二）（三）（四）（五）（六）（七）</p>
<p>〇〇〇〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>五總計〇</p>
<p>賣弄表演</p>
<p>綜觀紅襪球藝，防守堪稱嚴密，進攻則未見若何特長，且因係半職業性球隊，每好賣弄誇張性之表演，積習所至，易犯輕驕，此種表演，用於爭取觀衆之職業球賽，尙有可原，用於敦睦邦交，聯絡感情之國際性比賽，則有乖體育精神，亦與原旨背道面馳，願體育大使注意及此。</p>
<p>明星迎戰</p>
<p>紅襪隊第二戰，定今日下午三時在衡山路美童公學與聚京滬兩地中外健兒精華之中國明星隊會師，明星隊擁有中華俞長鑾，梁友義，空軍麥克一來等好手，實力較中華更見雄勁，當可予客軍以更大威脅。球迷欲欣賞紅襪身手者，可向上海業餘體育會洽索參觀券。</p>

<p>自由談作品的厄運  霜廬　　英國約翰·李曼所編的一新創作」中，有不少好文章，尤其是介紹歐洲大陸的作品，値得珍貴。歐洲正在苦難之中，我們只聽到他們物質上如何如何缺乏的消息，誰還注意他們的精神成就呢？　　筆者看到的是最近期的「新創作」第三十三輯，除了紀德記保羅·梵樂希的論文之外，還有義大利作家安東尼奧·鮑提尼的一個短篇「從月亮上逃回來的人」，也是佳搆。　　但使我最感慨的還是編者李曼在卷首的序文，其中有這樣一段：「新創作」的目的不但在提供近代歐洲作家的作品，還介紹海外的英語作家的東西，美國作家決非例外。在戰時，我們的機會不多，但我們仍排除萬難，偶爾刋行今日法國，希臘，捷克等國傑出之士的小說，詩，和論文。各自治領的作家不多……惟美國作品的出現實在難得，雖然編者非常歡迎惠稿。但這只是我們的單相思，或者是美國的雜誌編者橫梗在我們中間，揮着一疊疊的美金票以惑人之故？……　　李曼的感慨有點像窮人嘆氣。其實「新創作」的水準要比美國一般刊物的水準高得多，李曼固然不特別看重美國人的作品，只是為了刋物內容的「多彩」的緣故，很想邀大西洋彼岸的作家們來「共襄盛舉」。然而不行，美國的名作家並不缺乏金鎊，而英國的名作家到很缺乏美元，如蕭伯納之流，除了向泰晤士報來函欄投投短簡以外，一篇短文也要到美國去登的，美金票的魔力如何不大？　　美國作家受到錢的誘惑太多，作品便大多是墮落的，最顯著的現象是席俗的愛情故事和荒誕的偵探小說的流行。雖然印刷漂亮，五彩插圖，但與實際的人生又有何關係？　　在政治上，像英國，像法國，是拜到在「美人」的石榴裙下的，但在知識界，對「美人」的評價便不同了。美國的出版界肯出高價，但要你迎合他們的低級趣味。但中國的出版界呢，趣味如何且不說，但對作家却竭苛刻之能事，結果是造成了一班寫作奴隸，過着半死不活的生活。嗚呼！談恰切  津津　　要說明這一個題目，不妨用穿衣服來　喻。據說有一等本領的成衣匠，製衣時能够儘量表現體格上的美點，如闊肩胛，身材高大等，同時儘可能掩去種種瑕疵，如胸部扁平，腹部凸出等。我還聽說海外講究的成衣舖，更照着人體各部份的尺寸，用鋼絲製造一個衣架，照此衣架縫製，完工後穿在身上，自然處處恰切了。　　可是這樣的恰切，往往就很難。縫製時不但須費去很大的工夫，而且須留心種種小節。我最近製了一套衣服，橫改豎改，終不能滿意。推面廣之，世界上的任何人或任何事要配合他們的身份或伶到好處，也實在百不得一。一個加意描摹工人神態的演員，也許會忘記化裝他一雙雪白的手。　　與此相類的情形，連貴為阿比西尼亞皇帝，也被旁觀的外國記者們認為遣憾。美國某作家在一九四七年十二月出版的某雜誌中，引述阿皇的一件軼事道，海利·撒拉西皇帝在一九三六年報聘英國。皇帝高坐在敞頂的馬車中，向着成千成萬的夾道歡呼的倫敦人，頷首微笑。他忽然出其不意，將鼻涕向半空甩去，一時使隨侍阿皇的英國迎接人員大窘。　　言外之意，皇帝應該恰如皇帝的身份，他甩去鼻涕的動作，到十一二年後的今日，還被引為談助。　　本來，阿國人的習慣，未必與英美人一致，我們不可據此而為阿皇詬病，英美人也另有他們的繁文褥節，有的是那一類專講「禮儀」的厚厚的巨著，不渦英美人在科學上與辦事效率上講究「恰切」與「一絲不苟」的造詣，確能使人佩服。　　返觀國人，對於任何事，就要寬大得多.我們見到與聽到的以「不求甚解」「聊以塞責」「隨隨便便」等居大半。恰切一詞多半已在字典上抹去，而過份重視恰切，竟似跡近苛求。的確，在這年頭，我們的生活過得很忙碌，縱使要「求疵」，幾乎連「吹毛」的餘閑都沒有了。中美官俸比較  翼雲　　美國聯邦政府現行的官俸表，是在世界大戰後，物價騰貴，經政府重行修訂的，其薪額概以全年計算，表中計分四類：（一）專門職業類：凡工程師，技師，醫師等，均屬之。（二）次專門職業類：凡測量，繪圖，監工等員，及護士等，均屬之。（三）文醫財政管理類：凡非技術人負，辦理打字，收發，管卷，文醫，事務，會計，及行政管理者，皆屬之。（四）技工保衛類：凡司機，電匠，門警，守衛等，均屬之。第一類薪額，計分八級，初級最低薪二·六四四·八〇元，最高薪三·三九七·二〇元，若升至最高級，則為九·九七五·〇〇元至一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇元。第二類之薪額亦分八級，初級最低薪一·六九〇·〇〇元，最高薪二·〇九三·〇四元，若升至最高級，則為三·三　九七·二〇元至四·一四九·六〇元。第三類薪額計分十五級，初級最低薪一·七五六·〇〇元，最高薪二·一六八·二八元，若升至最高級，則與第一類同。第四類薪額計分十級，初級最低薪一·〇八〇·〇〇元，最高薪一·四〇二·〇〇元，若升至最高級，則為三·六四八〇〇元至四·四〇〇·四〇元。按照上列薪額，其初級支薪，以第一類為最多，第三類次之，而升至最高級，則此二類之薪額均相同。初級支薪最少者，莫如第四類，最低薪額僅一·〇八〇·〇〇元，比較第一類初級最低薪額二·六四四·八〇元，尙不及半數，可見門警機匠之卑賤，不能與專門職業人員，而非大學畢業不能充任者，（美國規定第一類須大學畢業，若碩士，博士，則初派即可支較高薪。）相提並論。　　茲再將吾國現行官俸表，與美國比較。吾國委任第一級薪額（即委任最高薪額）為月薪二百元，按六月份生活指數京滬區四十二萬倍計算·合法幣一千九百七十四萬元。薦任第一級薪額為月薪四百元，按上述生活指數計算，合法幣二千八百十四萬元。簡任一級薪額為月薪六百八十元，按上述生活指數計算，合法幣三千九百九十萬元，若不自量力，將簡任最高薪額，與美國第一第三類之股高薪額比較，則其情形如下：　　（一）我國簡任最高　月支六百八十元——以四十二萬倍結算，合三千九百九十萬元——以官價四五九·七八〇折合美鈔，則僅八十六元餘。　　（二）美國第一第三類最高薪額，年支一萬美元——合月支八百三十三美元有奇，以官價四五九·七八〇折合法幣，約合三億八千二百九十九萬元餘。　　觀上述情形，可知照此比較，尙不及十分之一，與之相比，未免太不自量，只得降格與其第四類之門警機匠比較，結果如下：　　（一）美國門機匠，其初級最低年薪為一千〇八十美元，合月薪九十美元，——以上述官價折合法幣，約月支四千一百三十餘萬元。　　（二）我國簡任最高薪，僅月支三千九百餘萬元，與之相比，已愧不如，若以荐任最高薪月支二千八百餘萬元比之，則更望塵莫及，若以委任最高薪月支一千九百餘萬元比之，則不及其半數。　　按美國公務員現仍感待遇菲薄，逈不如民營事業之職員收入倍豐，無怪我國公務員窮得自殺了。「醫」與酸梅湯  尤墨君　　夏令解渴的東西，農民都喝生冷水，都市中人則有得吃西瓜，喝汽水或可口可樂，嘗冰洪淋等福氣。還有一種呌做酸梅湯的論杯計値，到處可見之，且無不以北平酸梅湯爲標榜，因這湯以北平製者為最佳。這湯何人發明，已經不易考證了；但實在很「古」。　　按今之酸梅湯，即古之「醫」（去聲）翻開周禮，無論「四飲」，「六飲」，都有「醫」。周禮天官酒正云：辨四飲之物，二曰「醫」。註謂「醴濁，釀酏為之，則少淸矣。」酏，據玉篇云，淸酒也。據此「醫」是今之鑲拚酒，如狀元紅拼鑲竹葉靑之類，是酒而非夏令飲料可知。　　又按周禮：「獎人掌六飲」，其五為「醫」。鄭註以為梅醬能生津止渴者，這即是今酸梅湯之權輿。不過梅醬太覺濃膩，於是而有「醷」。禮記內則有「漿一水醷濫」句；註謂醷，梅漿也。按漿比醬薄得多，故「醷」之製成，必以「醫」為原料，再拼以水無疑，這即今之酸梅湯了。一個賊的肖像  陳湘　　「那是一張糟不堪言的畫像，我拒絕付錢。」下了這種苛刻的判斷，愛利梅·克良先生轉身離開年靑的匈牙利畫家阿柏德·薩比西（Arpad　Debesy）的畫室。　　幾星期的光陰虛擲了，五百元潤資隨之落空。薩比西痛苦的想起這位巨富因為太忙，一共不過讓他當面描繪過三次，所以，整個的像差不多全憑記憶畫出來。雖然如此，實在還是很像的。　　「請留片刻！」他呌道，「你肯出一封信給我說：你拒收這幅畫像是因為它不像你嗎？」那位大富翁想不到脫身如此之易，便欣然允諾了。　　數月之後，「匈牙利畫家協會」在匈京的畫廊舉行了一次展覽會。開幕不久，克良的電話鈴就響了起來。半小時之內，他出現在畫廊，直向陳列薩比西的作品那一廂奔去。那裏正掛着他曾拒收過的那幅畫像。　　對畫一瞥，他的臉漲得紫紅。他暴怒的衝進畫廊經理的辦公室，要求立即把那幅像拿掉。經理鎭靜的解釋說：一切的作品都訂好合同，要在畫廊中實足展覽六星期。　　「可是這會使我成為全京城的笑料，」克良忿怒的咆哮，「這是公然侮辱，我要控訴。」　　「等一等」，經理警吿說·他拿出了那封克良應薩比西之請而寫的信。「你自己承認過那幅畫不像你，一他冷冷的說，「所以你對它的處置無權干涉。」　　在絕望之中，克良祗好出錢把那幅書買下來，這時他才發覺定價已是原先的十倍。為了保持自己的聲譽，克良忍痛的簽了一張五千元的支票。　　薩經西略施小計，不僅把被拒撫卹畫像依舊賣給了委託也畫的人，並且痛央也出了一口氣。原來，在展覽時，也把那張畫加了這樣一個題目—「一個賊的肖像」。　　考試制度有長久之歷史，於政治，於文化，於社會有重要之關係，歷代稱為一掄才大典一，鄭重無比，而從未設立專管此事之政府機構，實為可詫。有之，則自國府根據五權法意，設「考試院」始。　　按「掄才大典」，唐代規模略具，宋世屢事修繕，至明淸朝殿之試，鄉會之試，科歲之試，進士，舉人，買生，生員，又各分數級，科塲科名，一切燦然大備矣。然彼時政府六部中與考試最密切者惟禮部，禮部以典禮為職，所管朝會，祭記，祠廟，乃至皇室之墳陸典守，各官之印信鑄浩等等，雖管科塲之事，而顧名思義，殊不副其實。又考其來歷不正，唐史可徵。開元二十四年三月「敇禮部侍郎掌貢舉」，以一舊制考功員外郎掌貢舉，有進士陵侮之，議者以員外郎位卑不能服衆，敕委禮部侍郎」。司知當初只因禮部侍朗官職比功員外大，是體制較强之關係，非謂典禮之官，即當然掌管科舉等事也。　　淸代禮部在事實上為管理大小科塲及科名之總匯，小副各省學政之考秀才，考貢生，及府縣各學校之事，皆須以　册報禮部，司其考成，大則鄉試之主考，每科例由禮部上奏請旨簡放，科塲旣畢，由各省藩司彙解試卷於禮部，至次年之春，則全國各省新舊舉人齊集京都，以應「會試」，禮部更忙，請簡考官（即各大總裁），同考官（即分校），請簡「知貢舉　（即總管全塲之大臣），及分派塲中大小職事一切事宜，故會試又名「禮部試」，又名「春官試」。此試榜上有名者，乃得應殿試（即　帝親試，所謂「臨軒一策士）。於是寒窗辛苦，一舉成名天下聞，為科名之登峰造極。以上僅舉綱要，細目甚繁，不能詳列。禮部與考試如此密切，然其部名與「考試」殊無關涉，其部中之各司，如儀制司（管朝會及與服嫁娶），祠祭司（管廟祀，喪禮，卹典，頒發曆本，僧道各寺觀），主客可（管各國朝貢及各地方進貢，恩賞），精膳司（管　宴及牛羊品數），鑄印局（管製造各部院各省大小官印信），並無管科塲管考試之名目。　　因唐代以科舉之改隸禮部，本就是臨時處置，麻麻胡胡，若認眞考較，尙不如當初之隸屬「考功」為有意義。考功為史部之分司。史部以銓選官史，考覆百官為職，掄才選士，原為登用賢俊，故貢舉與銓選相近（比典禮近）。而今老試院與銓叙相關迎，名實相符，系統正確。以規制論，比前代整齊多矣。歸省舟中作  張維　　再疊張一渠先生原韻　　碧海茫茫水接天，故園回首應依然，歸心勝似晚潮急，安返慈親慰暮年。　　敢隨世俗共沉浮，七尺昂藏强自留，惡世縱難分五濁，空山亦自有淸流。　　悟時到處是壺天，天上人問總　然，劫後幸留遺籍在，溫書閉戶度長年。　　輕裝率母一舟浮，都市繁華未忍留，歷代興亡成往事，祗今江水尙東流。（卅七，六，廿六，寄自瀏陽南埠嶺半山草廬。）</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The grand battle in the Yü-tung Yellow River Flood Area is in full swing. President Chiang specially took the Meiling airplane at noon on the 2nd to inspect the battlefield above Sui County and Qi County, and then returned to Nanjing by the same plane.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] After the President flew over the Yü-tung battlefield at noon on the 2nd to inspect, morale was greatly boosted.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] Liu Zhi and Du Yuming returned to Xuzhou from Zhengzhou by special plane at 2:00 AM on the 2nd. On the way, they flew over the Yü-tung battlefields to supervise the fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to an urgent telegram sent by a military news agency reporter from the Yü-tung front line at 11:00 AM on the 2nd: The grand battle of Yü-tung, which lasted for four consecutive days, had resulted in the first round of victory for the National Army by the morning of the 1st. The bandits gathered the main force of Chen's 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns and the Liangguang Rapid Column in the narrow area between Sui and Qi, and Liu's 1st and 11th Columns also participated in the battle for the core positions, a total of seven columns concentrated in a counterattack. The bandits initially intended to use elite troops and the old tactic of "using the large to eat the small" to attack certain divisions of the National Army. As a result, they were subjected to the mobile strikes of the National Army and defeated individually. In addition, with the proper coordination of the army and air force, the right-wing positions of the bandits' main force of more than seven columns were broken through on the line of Ruanzhuang and Diqiudian. The powerful National Army that entered Ruanzhuang (10 kilometers east of Tiefosi) continued to encircle and fiercely attack the bandits in Diqiudian (northeast of Sui County) after defeating the bandits in the area west of Ruanzhuang. In the bloody battle that lasted until 9:00 PM on the 1st, only more than 200 bandit cavalry broke through and fled to the northwest, and the remaining more than 2,000 people were completely annihilated. Another National Army unit launched a fierce artillery attack on the bandits on the 1st, advancing vigorously from Taolinggang east of Qi County. A part of the unit recovered the main positions of Zhaizi (southwest of Yuxiangpu) and Peilindian on the evening of the 1st and joined forces with friendly forces advancing from east to west. In total, the bandits' casualties in the past four days have exceeded 20,000, while the National Army has only suffered 5,000 to 6,000 casualties. This is indeed an important victory for the National Army in the Yü-tung grand battle.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The Yü-tung Yellow River Flood Area annihilation battle has reached five days and nights, and the bandit army is making a last-ditch struggle. This afternoon, the National Army's outer line troops rushed from the east and west to coordinate with the inner line defenders to launch a fierce pincer attack on the bandits, vying for several important strongholds. Both sides engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat, repeatedly charging and killing. This vast plain of the Yellow River Flood Area is now completely shrouded in unprecedentedly fierce artillery fire and soaring yellow sand. The air force's Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Bohai Sea unit aircraft groups hovered in the sky all day long to assist in the battle, and the army-air force coordination reached the most ideal level. This afternoon, the National Army's large group of troops on the periphery successively captured strongholds such as Wanglaoji and Zhaolou (northeast of Sui County), Taolinggang and Xugang (southeast of Qi County), and continued to expand the results of the battle.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The unprecedented Yü-tung Yellow River Flood Area main force grand battle is continuing. Chen and Liu's bandit troops have obviously turned into a state of decline. A few days ago, they transferred the 2nd and 3rd police brigades of the Jilu-Yu Military Region, which were originally stationed in southwestern Shandong, to cross the railway west of Minquan and sneak into southwestern Sui County to participate in the battle. The National Army is opening its pocket, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 2nd] Mengcheng was captured by the communist bandits, and the Self-Defense Corps suffered heavy casualties. The bandits entered the city and looted wantonly on the 1st.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 2nd] Military news: Liu Bocheng's 10th Column has been transferred south from the vicinity of Tanghe to commit crimes in Fancheng. Also, bandit leader Chen Geng was indeed bombed to death in the Wan-dong campaign. His 4th and 9th Columns have again sneaked from Fangcheng and Zhaohe to Wuyang, with a tendency to re-invade the Pinghan Line.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Jinan National Army Advances on Two Routes; Recovers Pingyin and Wand; Fierce Battle Breaks Out Again in Yanzhou; National Army Firmly Defends Four Passes <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The National Army, advancing from Jinan on two routes, recovered Pingyin on one route on the 1st, and recaptured Wand on the other. From the 2nd, the former has advanced to the vicinity of Dong'a, and the latter has also crossed Pijiadian and advanced to the vicinity of Jieshou. The Jinpu Railway repair team, which accompanied the southward advance, has also extended the repair to Wand and is currently continuing the repair south with the army. Also, the main force of the bandit Bohai Column 11th Division is reportedly currently entrenched in Ningjiabu west of Zhangqiu, and a part is entrenched in Xinjiazhuang east of Zhangqiu. At the same time, the bandit New 7th Division, in order to obstruct the National Army's pursuit troops, has recently continued to sneak back from Qingyangdian west of Zouping to Junqiu. The National Army is continuing to suppress and eliminate them.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Recently, the bandits in central Shandong are requisitioning a large amount of timber from the people, attempting to extend the Jiaoji Railway, which originally ran from Fangzi via Weixian to Tanjiafang, to Zhoucun. In addition, they also plan to extend the railway northward from Zhangdian to Huimin and Dezhou, so as to connect with the already completed De (zhou) Shi (jiazhuang) line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] The fierce battle at the four passes of Yanzhou has intensified since one day and night. After repeated attacks were frustrated, the bandits specially gathered the remnants of their New 8th, 9th, 7th, and 13th Columns to launch a fierce attack on the four passes, especially the South Pass, where the fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. The bandits and our troops repeatedly charged and killed, reaching more than ten times in one night. The National Army defended firmly by relying on the dangerous terrain, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties, with corpses lying everywhere. As of 2:00 PM on the 2nd, the National Army was still firmly defending the four passes and fighting fiercely with the bandits.</p>

When reporters asked about the issue of changing the Northwest Headquarters, he said: When he was in Shaanxi, the President had personally instructed that it be changed to the Northwest Military and Political Government Office, still governing the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, but no decision had yet been made. Zhang elaborated on the point that the Northwest does not need to worry about bandit troubles. He said: The bandit troops in northern Shaanxi and southern Shanxi, after their replenishment is completed in three months, will amount to no more than ten columns. Now, even if we generously estimate that the bandits can launch eight columns to invade the west, the National Army also has strong troops to repel them. Moreover, if the bandits really have these eight columns, they will definitely covet Central China and attempt to cross the Yangtze River, and will not come to the Northwest to try to do the impossible.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Sino-US Bilateral Agreement to Be Announced Today; Our Government to Issue Statement; Agreement Valid for Fifteen Months <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Sino-US bilateral agreement on the use of US aid will be formally signed and announced at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:15 PM on the 3rd. At the same time, our government will issue a statement for this purpose. President Chiang has already issued an order on the 1st to appoint Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as the plenipotentiary representative of our country, and the US representative is Ambassador Stuart. According to reliable sources: the agreement is valid for a period of fifteen months, and will take effect from the date of signing. There is no provision in the agreement that our country must grant Japan and South Korea most-favored-nation treatment in trade. Other than that, it is largely the same as the bilateral agreements between European countries receiving US aid and the United States. According to the agreement, certain technical details for the use of US aid must be stipulated in separate contracts or appropriate measures must be taken by our administrative authorities, which are all being discussed between China and the United States and will be decided one after another. As for the "China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee," a separate agreement will be made.</p>
<p>Key Points of the Agreement</p>
<p>In the preamble to the bilateral agreement, the purpose and spirit of the United States' aid to China this time are cited, and it is explained that China and the United States have concluded the agreement in accordance with the aid to China bill passed by the US Congress and resolved to be accepted by the Chinese Legislative Yuan. The key points of its provisions are: (1) The US government's measures for aid to China and their termination are all based on laws enacted by Congress. The Chinese government will do its best to complete its self-help and reconstruction plan, and promises to cooperate with the United States to use part of the proceeds from the sale of aid materials to improve foreign exchange and private trade. (2) The Chinese government will earnestly implement its self-help plan, make full and effective use of its resources and manpower, US aid, and the property of Chinese people in the United States to increase production, and take necessary measures to stabilize finance and promote trade. (3) China and the United States should consult with each other when necessary, so that the US government can guarantee that its citizens' investments in plans approved by the Chinese government can be converted into US dollars. (4) The Chinese government should deposit an equivalent amount of legal tender when accepting grant-type US aid. This amount will be used for the administrative expenses of the American aid to China implementing agencies in China, inland transportation costs of relief supplies, and other purposes agreed upon by both China and the United States, including the development of China's production capacity, the development and production of raw materials needed by the United States, the repayment of national debt, and other plans to curb inflation. (5) The Chinese government agrees to conclude contracts with the United States so that the United States can obtain an increased supply of raw materials it needs. (6) The Chinese government agrees to cooperate to facilitate American transportation to China. China and the United States will also negotiate tax-free import measures for all relief supplies donated by the US government and private individuals. (7) The Chinese government agrees to supply the US government with sufficient reports on the formulation and implementation of its reconstruction plan. When one of the two countries, China and the United States, raises any questions arising from the agreement, both parties shall consult to resolve them. (8) The US government may send special delegations to China to implement the provisions of the agreement and inspect the implementation of the aid plan. The Chinese government will grant general diplomatic immunity to US staff. (9) Disputes between the Chinese government and US citizens arising from its measures will be adjudicated by the International Court of Justice or an arbitration court formed by mutual agreement. (10) The agreement is valid for fifteen months. If one of the two countries, China and the United States, believes that there has been a fundamental change in the provisions of the agreement, such as the aid ending before the scheduled date, the two parties will consult to decide whether the agreement will be amended or terminated early. If no agreement can be reached, either party may give six months' notice to the other party to terminate it. (11) US aid materials and legal tender deposits that remain to be used after the termination of the agreement shall be handled by agreement between China and the United States, while other contracts concluded under the agreement shall remain valid for their own stipulated periods and shall not be affected.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Control Yuan Adjourns <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Control Yuan has decided to temporarily adjourn from the afternoon of the 2nd. After the various regulations of the Control Yuan have completed the legislative procedures by the Legislative Yuan, it will then formulate various rules and regulations based on them and continue to hold meetings. The adjournment time is uncertain, but during the adjournment period, the exercise of the power of consent will not be restricted. The president may convene a meeting temporarily to exercise the power of consent. It is heard that the list of grand justices and examination commissioners nominated by the President will be sent to the Control Yuan soon, so the adjournment time may not be too long. The decision of the Control Yuan to adjourn was passed at the sixteenth meeting held on the morning of the 2nd. Yu Youren presided over the sixteenth meeting. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the secretariat read out the minutes of the fifteenth meeting, and then submitted a temporary emergency motion from Guo Changhe and 55 others, stating: "The issue of the right to propose various bills of this Yuan is extremely important and closely related to the exercise of power and promotion of supervisory tasks of this Yuan. Colleagues believe that it is necessary to seek a solution quickly through legal and reasonable channels, and propose that the plenary session of this Yuan decide to request the President to convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuans in accordance with Article 44 of the Constitution to determine a solution; during this period, the plenary session of this Yuan will be temporarily adjourned." In addition to the explanation by Guo Changhe, the commissioners had many opinions on the adjournment, and the speeches were enthusiastic and unresolved for a long time. The commissioners' opinions against the adjournment were that the reason for the adjournment proposed in the case was inappropriate and seemed to be coercing the Legislative Yuan. Liang Shangdong then proposed a revised opinion stating: "Before the various regulations of this Yuan have completed the legislative procedures by the Legislative Yuan, the general regulations of this Yuan cannot be formulated, and it is proposed to temporarily adjourn?" When it was put to a vote, most people agreed and it was passed. The meeting adjourned at half past twelve.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Most of the Control Yuan members believe that it is necessary to review the past work of the Control Yuan, and are brewing a motion: "It is proposed to establish a special committee to review the cases of impeachment and discipline submitted by this Yuan in previous sessions, promote their thorough implementation, fully exert the effectiveness of supervision, rectify officialdom, and revitalize the hearts of the people." The case is currently being signed and will be submitted for discussion after the resumption of the meeting.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke and his wife left for Shanghai by night train on the evening of the 2nd. Also, Gu Yu-xiu also left for Shanghai by night train.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan announced that the Legislative Yuan held its second plenary secret meeting on the morning of the 2nd to hear the government's report on the general budget. The meeting opened at 9:25 AM, with over 500 committee members present, chaired by President Sun. Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, Chief Accountant Xu, Finance Minister Wang, and Central Bank President Yu were all present. First, the secretariat read out the two memos from the Executive Yuan regarding the central government's general budget and special budget for the second half of the 37th year. Then, Premier Weng, Chief Accountant Xu, and Minister Wang reported on the budget compilation situation. Chief Accountant Xu spoke for the longest time, about an hour, while Premier Weng and Finance Minister Wang each spoke for about half an hour. The general budget proposal has two major features: first, the ordinary budget can cover expenditures with tax revenue and still have a surplus; second, the special budget can be offset by selling government-held materials and other methods, without the need to increase currency issuance. The three finished their reports at 11:15 AM. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued, and more than 40 legislators requested to speak and ask questions. The meeting adjourned after the eighth speaker because it was already noon. The meeting resumed at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and a committee member moved to change the agenda to review the price issue, which was passed without objection.</p>
<p>The Government Plans to Have Concrete Measures to Stabilize Prices and Currency</p>
<p>Premier Weng and President Yu then reported on the rising prices and their countermeasures. Premier Weng expressed optimism about the prospect of stabilizing prices, saying that concrete measures have been drafted and can be implemented immediately. He also stated that some prices have already fallen, and he expects them to continue to fall in the near future. President Yu stated in his report that the government will use effective methods to stabilize the currency. Then, the committee members raised questions, and nine people spoke, conducting a broad review of the price issue. Premier Weng and President Yu answered them one by one. Both the questions and answers were met with enthusiastic applause. Subsequently, the National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan reported on the review process of the "Regulations for the Organization of the慰勞 Group for Soldiers and Civilians Suppressing the Rebellion," which was decided to be discussed at the next Legislative Yuan meeting. Regarding the general budget proposal, the general assembly has decided that the Budget Committee will convene a joint meeting of all committees of the Legislative Yuan to first determine the review method, possibly conduct group reviews first, then convene a joint meeting for comprehensive review, and finally submit it to the Legislative Yuan for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 6:25 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the revenue and expenditure figures of the general budget proposal reported in the special dispatches of a certain Nanjing newspaper and several Shanghai newspapers on the 2nd, citing "United Press dispatches," the Legislative Yuan spokesman stated: "They are completely inaccurate." The correct figures will be released publicly once they have been discussed and decided, so it is hoped that the news media will not speculate in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e22">President Chiang to Convene National Revolutionary Committee Reform Meeting This Month; All Current Party Systems to Be Abolished <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] A certain Kuomintang figure told the United Press on the 2nd that President Chiang is expected to convene a meeting of party members from the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans this month to "completely reorganize" the Kuomintang. The details will be decided by the party members' meeting. A major feature of the reform plan is the abolition of all current party systems, including the Central Executive Committee, the Central Supervisory Committee, the Central Political Committee, and their affiliated agencies. Another feature is the implementation of a general registration of party members. The date and location of the meeting have not been decided, with Guling being the most suitable location, but there is also the possibility of holding the meeting in Nanjing. It is expected that the date will be after the Legislative Yuan's adjournment on July 20, or after major issues such as the budget, price control new plan, and the appointment of grand justices and examination committee members are resolved. The figure believes that the reform meeting will be an outbreak of years of accumulated party factional conflicts, after which the Kuomintang can appear as a new party. The figure stated that after the current organization is dissolved, a committee will be established to take over the powers of the Central Executive Committee. It is said that President Chiang, who is believed to be leading the reorganization, will decide the form of the reorganized party by majority vote and does not intend to personally support any faction. As a result of the reorganization, various factions will regroup, and "new people" will be responsible for important matters. The figure stated that this reorganization will likely be the "most drastic" since the reform presided over by Sun Yat-sen in the 13th year of the Republic.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Editorial: Suppressing Prices and Thoroughly Investigating Price Hikes <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The price hikes in June were truly frantic. The stormy waves have left the common people breathless. Now that the end of June has just passed, everyone is anxiously awaiting the opening of the July market today, hoping that there will be no more alarming jumps. The municipal authorities and military and police leaders of this city held an emergency meeting all day yesterday to discuss this matter, and the president of the Central Bank will also rush back to Shanghai today to take precautions. Whether the vigorous price suppression movement can achieve considerable results depends on whether the government and the good people can work together and whether those who implement government orders can be clean and selfless. Most importantly, the government must take a leading role in the price stabilization movement.</p>
<p>The new government under the constitution began its administration in June. The Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, witnessing the soaring prices in various places, have risen up to denounce it. The members entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the people must, of course, make some kind of statement. It is said that the Legislative Yuan will invite Premier Weng to attend a meeting and report, and the Control Yuan will send people to thoroughly investigate the reasons. In fact, the soaring prices are a reality, which the administrative authorities cannot deny. The soaring prices have their reasons, which everyone probably understands. The result of the thorough investigation will be no more than this and that. What remedy will there be for the prices themselves, and what benefits will there be for the people? The committee members, living in seclusion, always believe that the soaring prices are nothing more than the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants and the mischief of wealthy families. As long as the evidence is conclusive, killing one will be enough to warn a hundred. If it were really that simple, the world economy would not be panicking, and our China's various problems would have been solved long ago.</p>
<p>There are two types of price increases: one is a moderate increase, and the other is a frantic increase. From the perspective of economic principles, when the monthly interest rate of short-term treasury bills issued by the central bank is as high as 24%, and when the government adopts a high-interest policy, with general market interest rates at 30% or 40%, a moderate increase is naturally unavoidable. Because whether it is agriculture, industry, or commerce, everyone seeks profit. With such high interest rates, plus various expenses and legitimate profits, it is not surprising that prices rise every month in proportion to the interest rate. Unless the government adopts a low-interest policy, this trend will not change. However, the frantic increase, which goes beyond the norm, seems to be orchestrated by someone behind the scenes, ready to emerge. Contemporary commentators attribute it to military defeats, the overabundance of floating capital, the publication of the deficit, and so on. These all have their reasons, but none of them seem to scratch the itch. Military defeats did not start today, and floating capital has been overabundant day by day with the currency, and the size of the deficit has long been understood by everyone. But prices did not rise frantically then, while prices in June have increased more than ever. Isn't it because someone is stirring up trouble behind the scenes? So, what is the force behind the price hikes? Let's look at some factual analyses.</p>
<p>The necessities of life are nothing more than food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Although the government has not openly declared control over the general economy, it is implementing a seemingly partial control. Major cities are now implementing rice rationing. Although each person's ration is only 15 catties, it is better than no ration at all. However, why does the price of rice still follow the black market and adjust accordingly? Of course, the authorities are suffering in silence. With American rice in check, they insist that they are not allowed to sell it at a low price. Even though the municipal authorities of this city unilaterally decided that the price of rice for July rationing should be 10 million, which is more than half the market price, it is still twice as high as the price of rice for June rationing! The price of rice is the leader of all prices. The common people are not very worried about other things, but the price of rice is a huge threat. The central authorities seem to regard such an important matter as insignificant. They have not made a full effort to deal with it, nor do they have the魄力 to take responsibility for preventing it from rising with the black market. Since the government cannot stabilize the price of rice, how can it talk about stabilizing other prices? In fact, the government has plenty of rice, from the requisitioning of actual grain and American aid. The quantity should not be small. As long as it holds firm for three months during this time of year when the new harvest is not yet available, it can keep prices stable. Even if rice merchants have three heads and six arms, they will not be able to resist the power of the government that holds the actual goods. Clearly telling the rice merchants that as long as the black market rises, the price of rationed rice will also rise, it would be strange if the rice merchants did not raise the price of rice. Those in charge of grain administration may use the cliché of "cheap grain hurts farmers" to defend the adjustment of rice prices, but if the price of rice is stable, other prices can also be stable. If other prices are stable, why make the price of rice rise alone? Even if there is a black market, change the ration of 15 catties to a ration of 30 catties. If there is supply but no demand in the market, can the price of rice still rise?</p>
<p>Next is clothing, which is even more in the government's hands. The government has plenty of cotton, cotton yarn, and cloth. In addition to the political power of the Yarn and Cloth Administration, there is also the actual power of the China Textile Corporation. If the government does not plan on the legal currency, with 200,000 bales of cotton yarn, it can keep the price of yarn stable at a certain price this year without drastic changes, not to mention the amount of cotton and cloth in stock. Unfortunately, the government only uses the sale of cotton yarn and cloth as a tool to tighten the money supply, not as a means to stabilize market prices by supplying them at平價. We are accustomed to seeing that after the price of yarn and cloth rises to a certain limit, China Textile is ordered to sell some within the limit. Once in the hands of merchants, of course, the price will rise again. Isn't this ladder-like rise because the government is intentionally or unintentionally hoping for price increases, so that it can collect more legal currency?</p>
<p>The aspect of housing is extremely stable, which cannot but be attributed to the government's hard-pressing measures! Because housing is not within the scope of government allocation, and the government itself does not have many real estate properties that can be used for housing allocation, and the government's housing allocation management and use and the collection of fees are not subject to restrictions. Thus, on the condition that the government is generous at the expense of the owners, the rent in this city has been fixed between 7,000 and 9,000 times due to the resolution of the city council. The cost of living has been reduced a lot, and outsiders have criticized the city council for setting the rent standard too low! From this, it can be seen that the prices of things that are not largely controlled by the government can achieve a stable effect.</p>
<p>As for transportation, all means of transportation by water, land, and air require fuel, and among the fuels, coal, diesel, and gasoline are all in the government's hands. The government says to raise the price, and freight and fares have to rise accordingly. Coal is supplied by the Fuel Management Committee, and diesel and gasoline are handled by the diesel allocation committee of the Detailed Import and Export Management Committee. Without setting price ceilings, the adjustment of coal and oil prices is completely unreasonable. But no matter how unreasonable the reasons are, prices still have to rise, and they rise a little every three days and a lot every ten days, so much so that the water, land, and air transportation industries cannot adjust their rates in time. Moreover, when fuel prices rise by 50%, fares rise by 80%. People have to travel, so they have to pay the high price. Goods have to circulate, so they have to shear wool from the sheep. Layer by layer, who is driving up prices?</p>
<p>Since the reasons for the soaring prices are clear, if the government really has the determination to stabilize prices, it seems that it should first come up with a stable countermeasure. The local authorities in this city are vigorously carrying out inspections, registrations, crackdowns, punishments, etc., which should naturally be earnestly and fairly implemented. But the most important thing is that the central government should first have a determination in the short term, that is, the government's own controlled 物寳 and industries will never lead the price increases. The government should have a long-term vision and regard the profits calculated in legal currency as extremely small, and even subsidize what should be subsidized and lose money where it should lose money. If the government has no capital to lose, it may as well save some from construction projects that are not urgently needed to stabilize prices. Honestly speaking, now, apart from suppressing the rebellion first, the remaining forces should be fully used to stabilize prices! Only when prices are stable can we talk about economic construction. This work requires the mobilization of the entire new government, and it must be mobilized immediately without delay. It cannot be effective with the style of each administrative department doing its own thing, nor can it be half-done by the inquiries and investigations of legislators and supervisors. As for the strict investigations and punishments of local authorities, they are naturally only temporary measures.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhongming</p>
<p>——Message for the 26th International Co-operative Day——</p>
<p>In today's world, where the "Cold War" between the two major camps is fierce, and people are uneasy about the long-term prospects for peace, 150 million co-operators around the world, regardless of race or nationality, who share a common pursuit of human justice and the maintenance of world peace, are joyfully welcoming the 26th International Co-operative Day, which undoubtedly has epoch-making significance.</p>
<p>As early as a century ago, in 1835, Robert Owen, the founder of the world co-operative movement, attempted to use the power of international cooperation to reduce human exploitation and war and realize his utopian co-operative ideal in the London All Classes of All Nations Association. Owen's world organization was the most primitive form of international cooperation.</p>
<p>From Owen's All Classes of All Nations Association to the International Co-operative Alliance, the development of the international co-operative movement in the entire process of its development to the present stage can be divided into four stages.</p>
<p>From the establishment of the International Co-operative Alliance in 1905 to the conference held in Manchester in 1902, this was the development stage of the international co-operative movement. During this development stage, the ideal and method of international co-operation were determined. The main content was to promote the liberation of the co-operative movement from narrow nationalism and parochialism, and to advance to an international co-operative alliance without race or nationality. This progressive transformation, from the perspective of a co-operative republic and a world commonwealth, from individual to collective, from various countries to international unity, is undeniably a very important task. Although the Rochdale principles may be judged by history today as an unsound path, in the early days of capitalism, for the vast number of toiling masses who were overwhelmed by the tides of the industrial revolution and plunged into hunger and cold, the Rochdale pioneers did indeed perform a very valuable enlightenment work. In the charter of the International Co-operative Alliance, there is the following provision: "This association, in order to inherit the work plan of the Rochdale pioneers, is determined to replace the existing competitive system of private enterprise with a co-operative system based on the principles of self-help and mutual assistance, based on the interests of the entire society, in an independent spirit and in its own way." This is obviously an abstract statement, but it is sufficient to explain the contradiction between the international co-operative movement and the existing private system, and the task it bears. As the late Secretary-General of the International Co-operative Alliance, Mr. May, said: "To unite the people of the world, to enhance the happiness of individuals, and at the same time to create the civilization of the world, that is the ideal of the International Co-operative Alliance. It wants to create a world federation, eliminate war, avoid conflicts, create a social system that never sees wealth or poverty, and establish world peace." The great contribution of the international co-operative movement in this development stage was to determine the overall direction, goals, and tasks of the international co-operative movement, but it did not point out the relationship between the co-operative movement and politics, and the dependence on social systems, nor did it plan specific ways to struggle to realize the ideals of the International Co-operative Alliance, and combine the lofty ideals of the international co-operative movement with reality. Therefore, the international co-operative movement in this development stage can only do some co-operative education and research liaison work for the international co-operative movement.</p>
<p>From the conference held in 1904 until the year before the outbreak of the First World War, it can be said to be the second stage of development of the international co-operative movement. At this time, many progressive co-operators began to pay attention to the significance of the co-operative movement's link with the laboring masses and established the foundation of a new co-operative theory. The Swiss representative, Mr. Muller, advocated reminding consumers of the laboring masses' chain of thought and urged them to understand that the purpose of co-operation is not only to improve their own lives, but to abolish all profits. The promotion of this new co-operative theory did indeed play a very powerful role in promoting the development of the international co-operative movement, constituting the main feature of this development stage, moving from a utopian to a practical and scientific path.</p>
<p>The third stage of development of the international co-operative movement can be said to be a revival from a state of semi-sleepy stagnation. Beginning with the First World War and continuing until 1920, many groups withdrew from the Alliance due to the war, causing regular activities to be suspended invisibly for as long as seven years, which can be said to have fallen into a state of semi-sleep. During this period, although the Alliance passed peace resolutions calling for peace, based on the weakness of the Alliance's own organization, these utopian resolutions and calls for peace were dissolved by the fires of war. It was not until the Paris Conference of the French National Co-operative Alliance in 1916 and the International Co-operative Alliance Conference in 1927 that it was revived from its state of semi-sleep. In the second half of this development stage, it is worth mentioning that the Central Committee stipulated at the eleventh conference held in Ghent, Belgium, that the first Saturday of every July would be International Co-operative Day, and celebrations would be held around the world starting in 1922. This regulation has played a very significant role in the recognition of co-operators and the development of international cooperation. International co-operative organizations have developed extensively and widely during this period, co-operators have closely joined hands with each other, and the co-operative movement has appeared in a brand new posture in the second half of this development stage, forming a united front against capitalism. Its greatest success and greatest contribution lies not in the fact that the international co-operative movement in this development stage has transformed the major industrial co-operative sectors of various countries from individual forms to international forms, but rather that the co-operative movement in this development stage, after being baptized by the fires of the First World War and the blood and flesh, has grown out of battle and established closer ties between the international co-operative movement and the vast number of peasants and workers under the highly developed capitalism. Based on the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations established the International Labour Office Co-operative Department to improve the lives of workers in various countries. This new decision liberated the co-operative movement from the old "purely economic" confines and promoted it in a new direction of political and economic exchange, which was indeed a progressive transformation.</p>
<p>The fourth stage of development, since the international capitalist economy had a total crisis, and the Fascist bandits of Germany, Japan, and Italy formed an aggressive camp, madly launched aggressive wars, while China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, in order to maintain world peace, formed an anti-aggression camp, using war to eliminate war after the destruction of peace, in order to achieve the lasting peace and security of the world's human cooperation movement. During this period, it can also be said that in the first half of this stage of development, it had assisted governments in various countries to salvage the economic crisis, until the Fascist bandits launched aggressive wars, it was undeniably transformed and utilized by the Fascist bandits in the aggressive front, as a way to develop its military and economic power. However, the co-operative movement in the anti-aggression camp bravely donned the anti-aggression battle robe, assisted the United Nations, mobilized the masses, and participated in the work of economic warfare against the enemy. During the war in China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the co-operative movement was developing widely and assumed the epoch-making mission of the anti-aggression war. The mission of the United States, the American co-operators, further convened an international co-operative conference and passed a number of valuable international co-operative movements to cultivate senior co-operative cadres and talents, which means the expansion trend of the international co-operative movement. From the development history of the international co-operative movement over the past century, it has gradually transformed from primitive utopia to the road of scientific reality. It is hoped that the co-operators of the world will move in step from today onwards, work together, and shoulder the new tasks of this new development stage of the international co-operative movement, in order to lay the foundation for the permanent peace of the world.</p>
<p>The fifth stage of development, since the full end of World War II, the world's politics and economy have undergone fundamental changes, and the cooperative cause has also undergone major changes. In particular, the Eastern European countries have adopted new cooperative routes, which have played a major role in socialist construction. This September, the International Cooperative Alliance will hold its first post-war conference in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. There will be epoch-making decisions for the future international cooperative movement. The author will attend on behalf of China at that time, and will report in detail after the conference is over.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The Soviet Union's formal announcement that the Berlin Four-Power Allied Military Government has ended has plunged the Berlin crisis, which had seemed to ease in the past 48 hours, back into a complete stalemate. The Soviet Union and the Western powers have entered a comprehensive political and economic struggle in Berlin. In terms of immediate consequences, the U.S., Britain, and France may organize their political and economic life in the western sectors of Berlin on a three-power basis. The Berlin city government may split into two opposing bodies. The Soviet authorities may ban the activities of the Social Democratic Party in the eastern sector of Berlin and handle municipal affairs solely through the Socialist Unity Party, which is controlled by the Communists. In terms of long-term consequences, the Soviet action may further widen the diplomatic rift between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. In London, Bevin met with the U.S. and French ambassadors again today, indicating that the three powers' position on the Berlin issue will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] A British spokesman said that the three powers do not intend to take any action regarding the Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin Four-Power Allied Military Government until new instructions are received from London, Washington, and Paris. The administration of the western sectors of Berlin will be jointly responsible by the British, American, and French Berlin commanders for the time being. Another British written statement stressed that the British military government cannot recognize that the agreement on the four-power joint control of Berlin can be terminated by the verbal notification of a Soviet staff officer. The British military government will continue to abide by the agreement on the four-power joint control of Berlin signed by the Allied governments.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] U.S. Ambassador Douglas visited Foreign Secretary Bevin this morning, presumably to report to Bevin on the steps that the United States believes the Western three powers should take after the Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin joint military government. Tao received instructions from Washington last night. An hour before visiting Zhiwen, he attended a meeting of the three-power standing committee, which consisted of Sir Strang, Director of the German Department of the British Foreign Office, French Ambassador Massigli, and Tao. Colonel Holley, commander of the U.S. Army in Berlin, hinted today that the three powers would formally announce the implementation of three-power control in the western sectors of Berlin. British spokesmen in London and Berlin said that the reasons for the Soviet withdrawal from the Berlin joint military government were invalid. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the deterioration of the situation in Berlin was deeply regrettable. He pointed out that the establishment of the joint military government was based on the 1944 tripartite agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union and cannot be unilaterally abrogated by one country. It is believed here that the three-power standing committee in London is not currently preparing a direct note to the Soviet Union, but is considering practical measures to deal with the emergency situation in Berlin. The note to the Soviet Union will be submitted unanimously at a later date.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] The Western three countries are drafting a protest note to the Soviet Union. Diplomatic officials said that France has been uneasy for several months due to the Western position in Germany being too tough, so they emphasized that they must proceed with caution and opposed all "hasty and ill-considered" actions. A certain diplomat stated, "The problem lies in finding a middle ground between a protest that is too weak and a farewell letter that is too strong."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 1st] The commanders-in-chief of the British, American, and French forces in Germany all attended the West Sector Administrative Director Conference today. The conference discussed (1) electing a German constitutional assembly no later than September 1st; (2) reorganizing the occupying authorities; (3) delineating the boundaries between the West German states. After the conference agenda was decided, the administrative directors requested an extension of the conference to consult with their respective state governments. The administrative directors will gather in Koblenz on the 7th and 8th to discuss the Allied proposals. The date for a joint meeting with the Allied commanders has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] The premiers of the eleven West German states began implementing the first stage of the new West German constitution today. They met with the heads of the three-power military government at the U.S. military headquarters here, and after receiving the three-power proposals on the West German constitutional plan, they expressed their determination to convene the constitutional assembly as scheduled before September 1st. General Clay clarified the main points of the West German constitutional plan to the participating Gu총理, saying that the constitutional assembly will draft a democratic constitution, stipulating a federal government structure, and its system should be suitable for Germany to eventually complete national unification. The democratic constitution will also protect the rights of the states and the rights and freedoms of individuals. The procedure for the states to elect representatives to the constitutional assembly may be freely determined by the state legislatures. The total number of representatives to the constitutional assembly will generally be one representative for every 750,000 people. After the constitution is drafted by the constitutional assembly, it must be submitted to a referendum in each state for public decision after being approved by the Allied military government chiefs. If more than two-thirds of the states express their consent by a majority of the people, it will be binding on the states within thirty days from the date of approval. According to another draft of the occupation law, after the establishment of the West German constitutional government, the military chiefs of the occupying powers will still retain the following powers, including (1) German diplomatic relations; (2) control of foreign trade, domestic measures that may affect foreign trade, and the appropriate use of funds available to Germany; (3) implement agreed-upon regulatory powers, including the Ruhr control regime, compensation, industrial standards, abolition of armaments and disarmament, division of trust organizations, and certain sectors of scientific research; (4) safeguard the reputation and security of the occupying forces and ensure that their needs are met within limits; (5) ensure that the West German constitution is strictly observed. Except for the aforementioned reserved powers, the military chiefs may only exercise their full powers in the event of an emergency that threatens security. Clay also specifically pointed out that one of the original basic goals of the occupation, namely, the democratization of Germany, was not listed in the reserved powers of the military chiefs. Regarding this point, the Allied military chiefs are only responsible for inspecting, assisting, and providing advice to the German authorities.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 1st] Ranga, a member of the Indian delegation attending the International Labor Organization conference, said on the 1st that India does not want foreign aid for its industrial development to be provided in a "collusive" manner. Ranga is the secretary of the National Congress Party of India. He answered a statement made by former U.S. Ambassador to India, Grady, at the recent Far East Economic Conference held in India during a press conference held here.</p>
<p>According to Ranga, Grady stated that if India and other Far Eastern countries need U.S. capital, they must guarantee that the U.S. receives rewards. "He makes us suspect that the U.S. investment in India requires us to recognize its right to infringe upon our economic freedom and sovereignty." "I am speaking on behalf of the National Congress. We need to know the amount and conditions of the investment. India welcomes foreign capital and technology to strengthen its contribution to world democracy, but we oppose any assistance that could put us in a colonial position."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Former U.S. Ambassador to India, Grady, said on the 1st that he believes India has no reason to worry that U.S. capital or other foreign capital will threaten its economy. He said that Indians worry that a large amount of foreign investment will dominate the Indian economy, and they firmly believe that this kind of economic monopoly will negate their efforts to achieve political independence. "Because of the difficulty in gaining political independence, Indians have not yet decided on a policy to encourage foreign investment. Given time, they will be able to overcome this fear."

<p>Resident Delegation in Japan is Assisting Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd] After the earthquake and fire in Fukui, there is a risk of flooding. After the riverbank of the Kuzuryu River collapsed during the earthquake, continuous heavy rain has caused the river to overflow, inundating 800 acres of farmland. More than 80 houses downstream of the river that were spared from collapsing during the earthquake are in danger of being flooded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our Resident Delegation in Japan estimates that at least 100 overseas Chinese were affected by the recent earthquake in Fukui. Two representatives from the Chinese Residents Association in Japan, carrying a small amount of relief supplies, including canned food and medicine, went to Fukui two days ago to investigate the actual situation of overseas Chinese residing in the earthquake-stricken area.</p>

<p>— Sent by Weng Shaoqiu from New York</p>
<p>—An Undisclosed Concern for the US—</p>
<p>American money, flowing across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to aid the recovery of various nations, now finds that its own neighborhood is disorderly and chaotic. As the US devotes itself to aiding Europe, the unrest in Latin America is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>The security of Latin America is as important as the security of Europe and Asia, and the US is naturally concerned. The large-scale bloodshed in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, a few months ago is one example of the unrest in Latin America. There has been a political rebellion in Costa Rica in Central America, and Chile and Brazil have also experienced a trend of strikes, costing a number of lives. In Guatemala, a revolutionary plot has been revealed.</p>
<p>The security of Latin America is as important as the security of Europe and Asia, and the US is naturally concerned. The large-scale bloodshed in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, a few months ago is one example of the unrest in Latin America. There has been a political rebellion in Costa Rica in Central America, and Chile and Brazil have also experienced a trend of strikes, costing a number of lives. In Guatemala, a revolutionary plot has been revealed.</p>
<p>The US will pour more money into stabilizing Latin America, but the question is whether US money can quell the current unrest in time.</p>
<p>The fundamental cause of instability in Latin America is low wages and rising prices. The people's standard of living was already low, and now, with inflation, life is even more difficult. Opposition parties and Communists seize this opportunity to create as much trouble as possible.</p>
<p>The difficult situations in each country vary, but the countries with the most severe inflation have the most difficulties. The government is weak, while the power of the Communist Party is gradually becoming stronger.</p>
<p>The current situation in Latin American countries is analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Brazil has a population of 47 million, and most people cannot afford to buy necessities. The current cost of living is three times higher than in 1940. The Brazilian industry is mostly weaving and other light industries, but heavy industry has begun to develop. The main exports are agricultural products, and Brazil's coffee exports rank first in the world. The government led by President Dutra is a government for the people.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Communist Party has about 150,000 members and has recently been declared an illegal organization by the government. The party is now engaged in underground activities and is carrying out a strike movement.</p>
<p>Brazil experienced a revolution in 1930, which resulted in the dictatorship of Vargas, who was later overthrown. Currently, a revolution is unlikely to occur in Brazil unless Vargas cooperates with the Communist Party and obtains the support of a portion of the army. However, the Communist Party will still create other troubles.</p>
<p>Paraguay has a population of one million, and farmers still live a primitive agricultural life. The 8,000 Communist Party members in Paraguay make President Moniz anxious. The Paraguayan government is a dictatorship. Paraguay experienced a revolution last year, which almost succeeded. Paraguay will continue to experience revolutions at any time. Once a revolution succeeds, Moniz's intended successor, Gonzalez, may not be able to succeed as president. Gonzalez is preparing to take office as president on August 15.</p>
<p>Chile is the world's largest exporter of saltpeter and copper. The country has a population of six million and is currently threatened by inflation. Most of Chile's industry is light industry, but the government is building a steel mill and developing forestry and fisheries. The government led by President Videla is a democratic government. The Communist Party has about 50,000 members, and the government is trying to disperse the power of the Communist Party and stop strikes and work stoppages.</p>
<p>Chile experienced a revolution 15 years ago. Currently, a revolution is unlikely unless the Communist Party obtains the support of the army or the national police, but work stoppages and riots are likely to occur at any time.</p>
<p>The economic lifeline of Bolivia is the export of metals, mainly tin. The country has a population of four million, and the people's standard of living can be said to be the lowest in the Western Hemisphere. It is also experiencing inflation. Politically, the government led by President Hertzog is a democratic government, and the Communist Party is weak. There was a revolution in 1946, and there has been no serious political threat since then. A revolution may occur in the short term if the tin market declines.</p>
<p>Peru's President Luis led a government that was initially a democratic government, but after a series of political assassinations, the president announced the dissolution of Congress.</p>
<p>Peru has a population of eight million, and the cost of living is three times higher than before the war due to rising prices. The main industrial products are metals and light industry.</p>
<p>The Peruvian Communist Party claims to have 35,000 members, but its actual strength is not great. There was a revolution in 1933. There is no revolutionary trend at present, but the opposition party is very strong, and a revolution is possible at any time.</p>
<p>Ecuador (also known as the Equator) has had 15 presidents and several provisional governments in the past 20 years. The current president, Yerosmena, intends to organize a democratic administration, but the government is unsound.</p>
<p>Ecuador has a population of 3.3 million, and most people are engaged in farming and animal husbandry. The Communist Party has 2,500 members. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Authorities Determine Concrete Measures to Thoroughly Prevent Further Price Increases; Limit of 200 Million Yuan for Cash Brought to Shanghai; Order All Industries to Register Inventory; Temporarily Approve Rice Market to Open, Limit of 16 Million Yuan per Shi <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, military, political, police, and security officials, along with heads of various commodity price and financial agencies, met at the garrison headquarters to decide on five measures to prevent price surges. Commander Xuan has already telegraphed the President, suggesting that a unified price control agency be promptly established in Shanghai. Commander Xuan met with reporters at 4:00 PM and announced the five important decisions of the meeting as follows: (A) Control currency and tighten credit: (1) Suggest that the Central Bank limit withdrawals and prohibit commercial firms from handling outward remittances. (2) Cash brought to Shanghai exceeding 200 million yuan must be deposited with the Central Bank. The Air Force First Military Region Command is responsible for inspecting cash transported by military aircraft. The Garrison Command Inspection Office, in conjunction with the two-way police departments, is responsible for land transport inspection. The Garrison Command Inspection Office, in conjunction with customs, is responsible for waterway and civil aviation transport inspection. (3) The Financial Management Bureau will strengthen inspections of firms, inviting the assistance of military police, and firms found to be in violation will be suspended. (4) Eliminate secret radio stations and request the government to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts (mainly targeting Hong Kong). (B) Control prices and search for stockpiles: (1) Intensify market surveillance, and severely crack down on speculative activities in various markets at any time. (2) Summon responsible persons from various trade associations, strictly ordering them to register their inventories within a limited time. After the deadline, the military, police, and security forces will conduct a comprehensive inspection of warehouses. If the inventory exceeds the operating volume (i.e., three months' worth) or the storage time exceeds three months, the goods will be confiscated and the offenders punished in accordance with the measures for cracking down on hoarding of essential daily necessities. At the same time, all movement and concealment of materials to other ports are prohibited. (3) Reward people for reporting hoarding cases and provide generous bonuses. (C) Public sale of food and stabilize rice prices: (1) Accelerate the preparation of public food sales and implement comprehensive rationing. (2) Starting from the 3rd, temporarily allow the North and South markets to open, with prices not exceeding 16 million yuan per shi. (D) Crack down on over-the-counter securities trading, maintain normal transactions, and thoroughly dismantle the intercom phones outside the general market. Pay special attention to the activities of "Hengshu" and large investors, and those who violate the law will be detained. (E) Secretly investigate speculative manipulators in various industries. In addition to setting separate disposal measures for the main culprits, the remaining individuals will be sent to the Special Criminal Court to be severely punished in accordance with the "Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Republic of China During the Suppression of Rebellion."</p>
<h3 id="e68">Commander Xuan Describes Current Shanghai as a Volcano; Convenes Businessmen from Various Industries to Decide on Four Emergency Measures <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to prevent prices from soaring after the market opens today, the municipal authorities, led by Mayor Wu, Chairman Pan, Commander Xuan, and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, jointly convened a discussion meeting with representatives of various trade associations in the city at the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. Four emergency measures were formulated as follows: (1) Prohibit speculative funds from entering Shanghai. Hereafter, passengers on airplanes, ships, and trains will be strictly limited to carrying no more than 200 million yuan. Military police and security forces will strictly inspect the transport of cash by agencies and troops. Those exceeding the limit will be ordered to deposit it in the Central Bank, and the purpose of its use must be verified when it is used. (2) Strictly inspect all warehouses. Private warehouses must register their materials with the Social Affairs Bureau by the 6th of this month. Those who fail to do so will be sealed up and severely punished. (3) The transactions of daily necessities must be accurately registered. (4) Strictly crack down on "passing the buck" (speculation). Please have the various trade associations formulate their own prevention measures, and the Social Affairs Bureau will formulate measures to control warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>The representatives of various industries who attended yesterday afternoon included Xu Jilu from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ge Jichen, Xu Xueyu from the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Shi Zhifu from the new medicine industry, Guo Lingshuang, Huang Zukang, and Xiao Zongjun from the China-Great Company, Zhan Peilin from the paper industry, Pei Yuanding from the rayon industry, Ye Jinrong from the coal industry, Zhang Wenkui from the department store industry, Shan Wenjun from the miscellaneous grains industry, Chen Tingfang from the sugar industry, Shen Rixin from the money industry, Ma Zhongda from the import-export industry, Zhang Hanbai from the warehouse industry, Dong Yunfeng from the cotton industry, Rong Yiren from the flour industry, Wang Zhuyi from the textile industry, Qu Zhenhua from the rice industry, Zhang Chao from the oil industry, Li Tingdong from the China Vegetable Oil Factory, Hong Wenjiang from the pork industry, and Ma Wenbiao from the vegetable industry, among more than 40 people. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Chairman Pan successively expressed their opinions, speaking with great insight and seriousness. Xu Xueyu and Luo Qinghua also expressed their views. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Mayor Wu: The soaring prices in the past few days have been alarming. In order to prevent price fluctuations after the banks reopen, we have convened representatives from various industries today to discuss countermeasures together. The government will not deny that rising prices are due to inflation. However, the inflation rate is by no means as severe as the soaring prices. If we do not find ways to curb it, it will threaten people's livelihoods and public security. Those who will bear the brunt of the problem will be you. I went to the Garrison Command today to discuss policies with the military leaders. From now on, the transport of cash by military aircraft and various military agencies will be strictly inspected. I believe that as long as we get through July steadily, we can expect to utilize U.S. aid in mid-August, and the price situation will improve. Therefore, the government is determined to control prices this time and hopes that all industries will cooperate sincerely and work together to overcome this most difficult short period.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Determined to Use Human Intervention Methods to Sanction Artificially Inflated Prices <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Commander Xuan: Judging from the rampant price increases of the past ten days, Shanghai is like a volcano. Mayor Wu and I have repeatedly requested to resign to avoid the eruption of this volcano. However, as long as we are in office, we will strive to salvage the situation. The most worrying thing at the moment is the general public's adversarial attitude towards merchants, unanimously believing that merchants are hoarding and manipulating goods, thereby depriving the people of their right to survival. The formation of such an adversarial front cannot be ignored in the future. I believe that those who disrupt the financial system through improper means are only a small number of merchants. The majority of legitimate merchants are willing to do everything possible to save themselves from this crisis. The current price surge clearly has artificial factors, so the authorities have decided to use equally artificial methods to sanction it.</p>
<p>Commander Xuan further added: Those who are anxious about the current situation should not only be government authorities, but also everyone here. Because currently, the city's security forces are sufficient to prevent all activities and concealment of the communists. However, when people are forced to take radical actions due to livelihood difficulties, it will be impossible to stop them. At that time, Mayor Wu and I will at most be detained or dismissed for investigation, while everyone's lives, families, property, and careers will all be destroyed. Therefore, I hope everyone will save themselves and others in time.</p>
<p>The Biggest Key Lies with Those Implementing the Policies</p>
<p>Chairman Pan: The recent crazy price increases in Shanghai were alarming. Before the central government announces specific measures, the municipal authorities must first find ways to suppress them. Otherwise, Shanghai may descend into chaos. The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated in an editorial a few days ago, "If the municipal government does not come up with a solution, Shanghai will collapse before the communists even attack." The situation is so critical that I hope the municipal government and the people can cooperate quickly to overcome these difficulties together. The implementation of any policy requires sincere cooperation between the two to be effective. Therefore, I would like to say frankly that the biggest key lies with those who implement the policies. If the implementers are not fair and impartial, even the best policies will be distorted. We are all living on a volcano right now and must salvage the situation before it erupts. I hope that all implementers appointed by the government will first pledge to Heaven that they will wholeheartedly serve the country and will not be corrupt, so as not to give the business community an excuse. At the same time, I want to implore people in the business community not to tempt the implementers.</p>
<p>Are There Shortages in Military Pay? Has There Been Panic Buying of Supplies?</p>
<p>Regarding the rampant price increases in the city, it is generally believed to be caused by speculative capital. Many people also believe that most of this speculative capital comes from the military. It is said that entire boxes of banknotes are transported to the front lines to pay soldiers, but then brought back to buy supplies. We cannot easily believe such rumors, but merchants certainly do not want this situation to exist. If we receive such information in the future, we can immediately report it to the relevant authorities. We advocate that if such cases are discovered, they must be severely punished. A few people should be executed to appease the public. Currently, the biggest expenditure in our country is military pay, but much of the military pay is actually shortfalls. We must thoroughly investigate these shortfalls. If military pay is indeed returning to the market, we must impose the most severe sanctions!</p>
<p>The Government Should Suppress Prices and First Lead by Example</p>
<p>Xu Xueyu: Ships from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arriving from Tianjin and Beijing have been found to be carrying large numbers of "danbang" (small-scale carriers), each carrying 200 million legal tender, which can earn them 60 million in exchange rate arbitrage. Since what they carry does not exceed the government's regulations, how should we stop this? Please, authorities, devise a method. Regarding suppressing prices, the government should first lead by example. The Fuel Control Committee plans to raise fuel prices by 160% starting tomorrow (the 3rd). Diesel prices have risen from 46 million to over 90 million in ten days, and will increase by another 45% starting from the 4th. If the items controlled by the government itself are the first to rise, how can we demand that private companies not raise prices? The government controls three of the four essential aspects of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation. But as a result, the price increases are the most severe. Therefore, I believe that to suppress prices, we must first demand that the items controlled by the government not be allowed to increase!</p>
<p>Businesses Should Endure the Pain and Sacrifice, but the Government Must Lead</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua: I would like to offer some fundamental advice. I believe that once China's economy collapses, people will resort to robbery, beatings, killings, and arson. The business community will be the first to bear the brunt. Therefore, the business community should rely on the government for survival. The mayor believes that as long as we can smoothly get through July, things will improve thereafter. During this short period, we must endure the pain and sacrifice, and cooperate sincerely. However, we must demand that the government take the lead. The government must first lead by example and be determined to sacrifice, so that merchants can follow suit.</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu inquired about the transaction registration and material application situation of each industry. The meeting ended at around 7 p.m.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 2nd Dispatch] Military News Agency: Chiang Ching-kuo, under the President's orders, left Nanjing again for Shanghai at 3:10 p.m. on the 2nd. He will work with relevant authorities to take stern measures and thoroughly investigate the speculative market.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Merchants Are Heartless and Collude with Japanese Residents in Smuggling. Large Quantities of Steel Needles and Seafood Smuggled. The Case Was Detected and Cracked by the Bureau of Investigation and Security. Lawsuits Filed Against Sheng Yu and Yosh井睦祜 <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] It has been almost three years since the victory, but Sino-Japanese trade has not yet begun. However, the profits to be made from Japanese goods in our city have led some unscrupulous people to collude with Japanese residents and engage in smuggling. Recently, it was discovered that a man named Sheng Yu colluded with a Japanese resident, Yosh井睦祜, who has been living in Shanghai for 30 years, using the Japanese ship Nisshin Maru to smuggle a large quantity of seafood to Shanghai. Unfortunately, the scheme was not secret and was ultimately detected and cracked by the Bureau of Investigation and Security of the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>Yosh井睦祜 is from Fukuyama Prefecture, Japan, and is 55 years old this year. He has lived in Shanghai for more than 30 years. During the War of Resistance, he worked in mining in Shanxi and ran a firewood business in Tianjin. In Shanghai, he served as the president of the enemy's "East Asia Science Research Association" and the chairman of the "International Friendship Association." After the victory, he was retained in Shanghai in the name of a member of the Committee for Japanese Affairs. However, he colluded with Sheng Yu, a Chinese national whom he had known since the War of Resistance. The two parties raised 120 million legal tender and, in March of the 36th year of the Republic, Yosh井 first bought a batch of American saccharin and sent it to the Nisshin Maru to be transported to Japan. Then, in April, Yosh井 smuggled more than ten boxes of steel needles from Japan and handed them over to Sheng Yu and another person named Liu to be sold on behalf of Song Baosheng at No. 11, Guangming Village, Jiangning Road, earning more than 60 million. Later, Yosh井 also claimed that he had two Japanese fishing boats, using his industrial company name, that had already entered the Huangpu River. He wished to fish in Chinese territory and brought 100 boxes of fish. Then, Liu and Yosh井 planned to negotiate with various fishing companies, but neither dared to come forward, and the customs did not allow them to stay. The next day, they sailed back to Japan. According to Yosh井, the saccharin was worth 500 million, and part of it belonged to a Zhu. In addition to the steel needles, the smuggled goods also included a large quantity of sea cucumbers and shark fins, which were transported by two Japanese named Ueno and Matsubara and handed over to a Japanese named Seno to be sold by Sheng, Liu, and others.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sheng established a Fumin Company in Shanghai, where 12 receipts and account books were found, all proving that Sheng and others had frequent financial dealings with Yosh井 and other Japanese and colluded with each other in large-scale smuggling.</p>
<p>After the Bureau of Investigation and Security was ordered to transfer the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public lawsuit against Yosh井睦祜 and Sheng Yu for smuggling and collusion with foreigners, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Smuggling and Tax Evasion.</p>
<p>Yosh井 has been detained by the District Prosecutor's Office. Sheng Yu, due to suffering from stomach tumors, has been released on bail and is receiving medical treatment in another location.</p>

<p>[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has recently reduced the number of flights on various routes. Among them, most flights from Shanghai to various locations pass through Nanjing, and the reduction in the number of flights has de facto reduced the number of flights between Beijing and Shanghai as well. However, a large number of newspapers, mail, etc. transported from Shanghai to Beijing every day are time-sensitive, and many people travel between Beijing and Shanghai for urgent official business. In order to meet the needs, the company has added special Beijing-Shanghai flights starting from the 5th of this month, with two round trips each day. The first flight departs from Shanghai at 7:30 a.m. and arrives in Beijing at 8:40 a.m., departs from Beijing at 11:00 a.m. and arrives in Shanghai at 12:10 p.m. The second flight departs from Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. and arrives in Beijing at 4:10 p.m., departs from Beijing at 5:30 p.m. and arrives in Shanghai at 6:40 p.m. In addition, in order to serve the public, the company will broadcast the arrival times of flights to Shanghai from various locations and any changes at 11:58 a.m., 1:45 p.m., and 2:01 p.m. daily on the 600 K.C. public radio station, starting from the 5th of this month.</p>

(3) The airmail postage for domestic insured letters will be calculated at five times the airmail postage for ordinary letters, i.e., 150,000 yuan per 20 grams. Further news: The Post Office will issue anti-tuberculosis stamps starting on the 5th. In addition to the face value, an anti-tuberculosis donation will be added. The design of the stamps features the Great Wall as a background, with a red anti-tuberculosis symbol printed in the upper left corner. There are three types: 5,000 yuan (youth color), 10,000 yuan (light tea color), and 15,000 yuan (blue-gray). Each type has an additional anti-tuberculosis donation of 2,000 yuan. The stamps are available in both perforated and unperforated versions, making them a great target for philatelists.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Movie Theaters Divided over Protests Against Western Film Distributors <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's first-run movie theaters are now divided into two factions regarding their protests against Western film distributors. The larger theaters that were originally first-run theaters before the war have sufficient equipment and are confident in their box office success. Therefore, they have decided to stand firm against Western film distributors. They say they would rather show domestic films than be held hostage by Western film distributors. However, some first-run movie theaters with poorer equipment and locations are worried that there will not be enough domestic films produced and that changing to domestic films so abruptly will inevitably affect their box office revenue. Therefore, for the sake of their own survival, they have already attempted to seek a compromise with Western film distributors. However, as of last night, there has been no formal indication as to whether Western film distributors will accept their compromise or set a new price increase standard to determine whether to supply new films. According to the Movie Theater Industry Association, it will be clear within a day or two whether moviegoers in the city will be able to see the new films that have been previously advertised by the movie theaters.</p>

<p>[Our Report] During the recent rice price surge, the People's Livelihood Survey Committee (民調會) adopted a temporary measure, releasing 6,000 "shi" (石, a unit of dry volume) of rice every other day to allow citizens to purchase supply rice (供應米) at one "sheng" (升, a unit of dry volume) per purchase certificate. Now that household rice (戶口米) has been distributed starting on the 1st of this month, this temporary measure is no longer necessary, and the sale of supply rice will be suspended starting today.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Crisis in the Publishing Industry: Purchasing Power Drops to the Extreme, Revenue Insufficient to Pay Salaries <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Amid the decline of all industries, the cultural publishing industry is particularly severely affected. Li Bojia, chairman of the Book Industry Association, told reporters yesterday that the problem facing the publishing industry today is no longer a matter of making or losing money, nor is it a matter of whether book sales revenue can cover the cost of paper. Far beyond that, the publishing industry's predicament has reached the point where monthly business revenue is insufficient to pay even salaries. For example, printing costs increased twice in June, and newsprint prices increased more than threefold, while book prices could not be raised proportionally. Because at a time when the majority of the people are struggling to make ends meet, the purchasing power for books has fallen to the extreme, and few books sell more than 1,000 copies. Recently, the Commercial Press sold cheap books at prices lower than newsprint, but there were still few buyers, and the future of culture is very worrying. Most of the smaller bookstores do not publish new books, relying on selling old books to survive. Large bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Book Company have also greatly reduced the number of new books they publish. The textbook business, which is the main source of income for various bookstores, was not very good in the first half of the year either. Due to transportation difficulties and blockages, a batch of textbooks scheduled to be sold in the Northeast is still piled up in Beiping and cannot be transported north. As a result, funds cannot be circulated, and the losses are very large. In addition, the recent war in Kaifeng destroyed a large number of textbooks, resulting in even greater losses. If this continues, the future of the book industry is unimaginable.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 1st Dispatch] Wang Zhongbai, an employee of the Sichuan Construction Bank on Shanghai's Jiangxi Middle Road, came to Suzhou with his lover, Shen Zhang (who works in the fingerprint section of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division), on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. They checked into the Lexiang Hotel in Suzhou that day. The next day, the two stayed in their room and did not come out. They wrote three farewell letters and asked the tea server to mail them. Then, they both took "Atering", a nerve tranquilizer they had bought beforehand, in an attempt to commit suicide. However, by noon on the 1st, the relatives and friends in Shanghai received the two's farewell letters and sent urgent telegrams to Suzhou to inquire about what had happened. Police officers were then sent to check on them and unexpectedly found the two lying on the bed, not poisoned. After examination by a doctor, it was found that there was no toxic substance and that the drug was probably fake. When questioned, the two admitted that they had attempted suicide by taking poison. Wang Zhongbai is currently being treated at Guangming Hospital because he has a slight fever. Shen was summoned to the bureau for questioning and has now been released on bail, awaiting pickup by the Shanghai Police Bureau. It is said that the two had a dispute in love and originally planned to end their lives in Suzhou. Fortunately, the drug they took was not poisonous, and they only staged a comedic scene.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Regulations to Crackdown on Vehicles Exceeding Fuel Limits <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Vehicles in the city are originally issued fuel purchase permits (購油證), which specify the amount of fuel that can be purchased at gas stations. However, recently, some vehicles have been found to be purchasing more fuel than the amount specified on their fuel purchase permits for the entire month. The municipal government believes that this situation not only hinders the overall gasoline supply, but also renders the fuel purchase permits ineffective, causing significant impact. Therefore, it has formulated measures to crack down on this, which have been approved by the Municipal Conference: (1) For the first time that a vehicle is found to have purchased more fuel than the specified amount, the excess amount will be deducted when the fuel purchase permit is reissued next time. (2) If a vehicle is found to have exceeded the amount again for the second time, the Public Utilities Bureau will, depending on the severity of the circumstances, issue a penalty of one to three months of suspending the fuel purchase permit. (3) If a vehicle is found to have exceeded the specified amount for the third time, its fuel purchase permit will be permanently revoked. (4) If gas station personnel sell fuel to vehicles in excess of the amount specified on the fuel purchase permit, or accommodate vehicle owners without permits, the Gasoline Allocation Committee will order the oil company to severely punish them. (5) If a fuel purchase permit is lost, it should be immediately declared in the newspaper (posted in three major newspapers in the city for one day each). After one month from the date of publication, a replacement permit may be obtained.</p>

The text of the telegram was drafted and sent by the secretariat of the council that night. Here is the excerpt: To Premier Weng and Deputy Premier Zhang Jun of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: We have just heard that Mayor Wu Guozhen of our city has telegraphed the central government requesting his resignation. Upon hearing the news, we are deeply alarmed. Since Mayor Wu took office in Shanghai, he has made many achievements and the people are happy and content. Currently, we are in a time of social unrest and economic turmoil. At this time and in this place, it is advisable not to change local leaders. Therefore, all the councilors of the Sixth General Assembly of the Council unanimously expressed their sincere request for his retention. We are sending this telegram to you, and if Mayor Wu has already telegraphed your esteemed office expressing his weariness, we sincerely implore you to grant him a reprieve in order to reassure the people.

<h3 id="e83">Telegram to the Legislative Yuan Requesting Delay in Deliberating Property Tax Bill <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council recently sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan requesting a postponement in discussing the property tax bill. The content of the telegram is as follows: To President Sun and Vice President Chen Junjian of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, and to all esteemed members of the Legislative Yuan: It has been noted that your Yuan's member Liu Butong and 48 others believe that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, a small number of people took advantage of the opportunities presented by inflation to accumulate unlimited wealth, leading to a widening gap between the rich and the poor, while these wealth accumulators bear no burden to the nation. Now, with the war expanding and the foundation of the nation in peril, the crux of the matter lies in how to make these wealthy individuals willingly contribute funds to equalize the distribution of social wealth and meet the needs of national reconstruction. Therefore, with this aim in mind, they proposed immediately levying a temporary property tax and drafted a bill, which has been submitted to your Yuan for review. We, the members of this council, deeply admire the reasons put forth by member Liu and others for levying the property tax, as they are both stern and righteous.</p>
<p>Difficulties and Disturbances Inevitable if Implemented</p>
<p>However, upon close examination of the contents of the property tax bill currently under review by your Yuan, its legislative principles include both personal and territorial jurisdiction. Its taxation targets include individuals and corporations, its taxation scope covers land, houses, equipment, automobiles, ships, and goods, its minimum taxable amount is as low as 50,000 yuan before the war, and its tax rate ranges from 5% to 50% or 60%. If implemented as passed, it is feared that the entire country will be thrown into turmoil, that legitimate production and business will be unable to survive, that the benefits will be unseen, and that the drawbacks will be numerous and chaotic. Please consider the reasons stated below:</p>
<p>(1) The draft bill stipulates that all real estate and movable property owned by citizens of the Republic of China abroad and non-citizens of the Republic of China within the country will be taxed. While the wording is fair and appealing, how can it be practically achieved? Nationals with property abroad can conceal their identities and seek protection from foreigners. Those individuals possess great resources and sophisticated methods. If it were possible to levy taxes according to the regulations, then the work of utilizing overseas deposits would have been accomplished long ago. The original proposer of this case, member Liu Butong, and the current Minister of Finance, Wang Yunwu, both personally supervised and guided the special levy for relief. They should deeply understand the difficulties involved. Based on past examples, the effectiveness is evident. As for the property of foreigners in the country, regardless of whether there are diplomatic issues, while welcoming foreign investment to China to assist in production, implementing measures to levy heavy taxes would be self-contradictory and run counter to our goals.</p>
<p>Genuine Wealth Evading Abroad</p>
<p>(2) The draft bill stipulates that the property of natural persons and legal entities must be taxed equally. In this situation, the truly wealthy, because their assets have already been moved abroad, seeking protection from foreigners, do not need to worry about being taxed. Even those within the country can easily conceal their wealth by holding gold, foreign currency, and other movable assets. Taking the effectiveness of our country's handling of inheritance tax in recent years as an example, it can be seen that, before the national property registration system is perfected, levying property tax on the movable property of natural persons is clearly akin to wishful thinking. Only those engaged in industry and commerce, with their goods, equipment, machinery, factory buildings, ships, and vehicles, which are all in plain sight and impossible to hide, will have to truthfully declare and pay taxes according to the regulations. Considering their actual economic situation, under the current state of inflation, production tools cannot be sold or mortgaged, goods and raw materials are gradually decreasing, wages are high, taxes are heavy, and purchasing power is weak. They are struggling daily to raise funds and maintain their operations through borrowing. However, when assessing their assets, they often amount to hundreds of billions or trillions. If heavy taxes are levied according to the current tax rate, they will inevitably have to sell goods and raw materials, using most of what they rely on for turnover and operations to pay to the national treasury, which will still be insufficient. After selling off their assets, they will face bankruptcy. All production enterprises will be wiped out, and millions of workers will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Everyone Becomes a Target of Taxation</p>
<p>(3) What is particularly dangerous is that, with the current rate of inflation, in just a few months, the total amount of property owned by an average middle-class family will exceed 30 billion yuan. In other words, everyone will inevitably become a target of taxation. Furthermore, because there are rewards for whistleblowing, with 30% of the recovered taxes being awarded to the informant if successful, and no liability for false accusations if unsuccessful, at a time when political integrity is declining and social morality is deteriorating, how can this not lead to turmoil and a loss of public support?</p>
<p>(4) Capital is fleeing far to foreign countries and near to Hong Kong, and the government is working hard to prevent this. If property tax must be levied, it will inevitably create a greater exodus of capital. The wealthy will take flight far away, while those with less will speculate in gold and cash. No one will invest in or operate legitimate production enterprises anymore. What kind of situation will this lead to? The recent surge in the black market exchange rate and commodity prices is due to this.</p>
<p>Government Taxation Should Be Done Responsibly</p>
<p>This council believes that the enactment of laws should be based on conforming to public sentiment, and the government's taxation should be limited to collecting without oppression. The property tax bill currently under review by your Yuan already demonstrates its great harm in the aspects mentioned above. Moreover, our country has been handling income tax for more than ten years, yet we have not dared to use individual comprehensive income as the basis for taxation. The income tax for profit-making enterprises still implements simplified tax collection methods, failing to levy taxes fully according to the tax law. Now, for a newly created property tax, to suddenly make such a bold attempt, is there any reason not to fail? Even if the government is deeply determined to implement the property tax, the investigation and assessment of the property of more than 2,000 large and small counties and cities and 450 million compatriots nationwide, plus various legal entities, will likely take more than three years (citing the words of Director Wang Fuzhou of the Direct Tax Bureau). The remedy will be too slow to address the urgent need. According to the original intention of member Liu Butong and others, it was nothing more than to liquidate the small number of wealthy individuals who have accumulated private wealth by relying on power and influence, and to confiscate their ill-gotten gains to equalize social wealth and supplement national finances. If this is indeed the case, then the drafting of the bill should concentrate efforts on focusing on the liquidation of the assets of a small number of wealthy individuals as a starting point. How can capital no longer flee? How can the fleeing capital be turned into national use? And how can the fragile domestic production enterprises not accelerate their bankruptcy as a result? These should be the urgent tasks for the members of your Yuan. This council, representing Shanghai, which is the center of industry and commerce in the country and bears more than 50% of the national tax burden, has a relatively comprehensive understanding and its actions have significant implications. As this council is holding its sixth general meeting, regarding your Yuan's decision to levy a temporary property tax at this time, we believe that it would be better to focus on a simple investigation of the assets of the wealthy. And since your Yuan has already established a committee to investigate the assets of wealthy families, if it intensifies its work and devotes all its efforts, it can achieve great results, reap quick benefits, please the public, and alleviate the national crisis. Therefore, after several days of careful deliberation, we have decided to: "Suggest that your Yuan quickly draft a law for levying a special tax on the wealthy and hand it over to the government for earnest implementation, or urge the government to strengthen the implementation of the special levy for relief to enrich the national treasury and meet the urgent needs of suppressing the rebellion. As for the currently under review temporary property tax law, the collection methods are not appropriate, and the implementation will inevitably cause turmoil and hinder legitimate production enterprises. There is nothing worse than this. It should be postponed for further discussion to reassure the public," and other words on file. The reasons are summarized above. We have always admired the members of your Yuan, who all come from the people and represent the consciousness of the entire population. We are confident that you will listen to the voices of the people and graciously adopt our suggestions. The foolish may have a good idea. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e86">First Maritime Day Celebrated Today with Enthusiasm in Shipping Industry <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Today is the first Maritime Day in our country. At 9:00 AM this morning, various shipping-related organizations and groups in the city will hold a commemorative meeting at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on Guangdong Road, sixth floor. Leading officials from various city agencies have been invited to attend the conference. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation will also send representatives to guide the event. In addition, at 8:00 PM this evening, Huang Muzong, director of the Maritime Administration Bureau, will give a broadcast speech on Shanghai Radio Station. All maritime-related agencies, groups, and schools across the country will also hold commemorative meetings simultaneously to celebrate China's first Maritime Day. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the preparatory committee for the commemoration of the first Maritime Day held a tea party at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on Guangdong Road, sixth floor, to entertain the city's press. Xu Xueyu delivered a speech on the spot, expounding on the four meanings of commemorating Maritime Day: (1) Promoting the connection of various groups in the maritime world, strengthening struggle, and creating a new Chinese shipping industry. (2) Making the government understand the current situation of the Chinese shipping industry and determining the policy of developing the shipping industry. (3) Actively training maritime talents and strengthening business management. (4) Urging the government to pay attention to the shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p>Li Yunliang Publishes Thoughts on Maritime Day</p>
<p>Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Shipping Trade Associations of the Republic of China, published his thoughts on China's Maritime Day, stating: Our country's coastal and inland navigation rights have been infringed upon for a century. In 1942, the unequal treaties were abolished, and navigation rights were recovered. However, some people still do not know what navigation rights are, and even think that it is a matter for shipping companies and has nothing to do with the people. Some even promote the fallacy that "transportation matters more than sovereignty." Our country's shipping industry at this stage feels particularly difficult to operate, especially passenger ships. The number of passengers without tickets is large, and the difficulty of maintaining order is such that even the military and police who enforce the inspection feel棘手. On the occasion of this first Maritime Day, we hope to awaken the government and the people to the reality of the shipping industry. On this festival, we must not only learn the ceremony of the American Maritime Day, but also learn its spirit of rapid progress in shipbuilding.</p>

<h3 id="e96">"I am a Labor Hero" - Wu Manyou Before and After Being Captured <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an 28th Telegram] In the "Liberated Areas" of northern Shaanxi, Wu Manyou is almost universally known. This old man, skilled in farming, was touted by the communists as a "red person." The title of "Labor Hero" forced him to expend even more labor.</p>
<p>A month ago, he concealed his identity, claiming his name was Wang Xicheng. However, when this reporter saw him again this time, the old man himself immediately said, "I am labor hero Wu Manyou, what's there to be afraid of!" As he entered the room, he was covered in sweat. Amidst everyone's polite deference, he took off the military uniform that looked oddly unfitting on him, and wiping away sweat with a red handkerchief in his hand. The military uniform, the red handkerchief, and the man accustomed to wearing farmers' clothes created an amusing picture.</p>
<p>Wu Manyou is now a special figure in the "Patriotic Youth Training Team." He lives in the same room and eats at the same table as the district team leader. It is said that he is now expected to receive a monthly salary equivalent to that of a captain. At the same time, among the prisoners of war, they are looking for his direct nephew, hoping to reunite them. According to him, he saw that "lad" during the confession meeting a few days ago, indeed, he was there.</p>
<p>Speaks a Mouthful of New Terms</p>
<p>Talking about his background, this humorous old man, besides being cheerful, couldn't help but feel emotional. Half a lifetime of vicissitudes, a lifetime of hardship, if old stories are brought up again, this emotion is unavoidable. He speaks with a strong northern Shaanxi accent. "Production," "comrade!" These new terms fill his mouth. He said:</p>
<p>"My old home is Hengshan, living in Yangtai Village, Shiwanzhen. The foundation is quite solid. We cultivated over a hundred "xiang" of land (in northern Shaanxi, land is measured in "xiang," with each "xiang" being about three "mu" of land). In the seventeenth year, northern Shaanxi had a bad year (famine year), and the family couldn't make it. I took my wife and children and fled to Yan'an. In Wu's Zao Yuan, south of Yan'an, we rented some land to cultivate. We are laborers. As long as you put in the effort, you can always harvest more grain. That's how we got by for a few years. There was a lot of production from the land, and although the landlords exploited us, life slowly got better."</p>
<p>Settling Down in Yan'an</p>
<p>"Originally, I thought, when the years are good, I would go back to Hengshan. Later, I got along fairly well in Yan'an, and the land in my old home was also cultivated by others. I took a look, what would I do if I went back? People wanted to divide the land. I sighed, abandoned the old business, and settled down in Yan'an with peace of mind. In the nineteenth year, my wife died. At that time, I was still very poor, had no money to buy medicine, and insisted on delaying her death."</p>
<p>Whenever he mentioned "production" or "labor," Wu Manyou immediately became energetic. From the wrinkles on his face, one could see that his nerves were stimulated. At the same time, in terms of dates and times, he also changed to using terms like "four-one" as a marker.</p>
<p>"I am someone who has suffered poverty. I understand the suffering of poor people. Therefore, I often lend surplus grain to everyone, without adding interest or exploiting. In northern Shaanxi, millet is the best grain. As long as we produce it, and we can't use it all ourselves, you can borrow it, what's there to be afraid of. After the War of Resistance, many refugees fled to northern Shaanxi, from Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, we treat everyone the same. Everyone gets along well. When they build houses and repair villages, we go to help for a couple of days. They say that I unite the poor well. Our crops are cultivated meticulously, they all say that I am good at production.</p>
<p>First Place Hero</p>
<p>In the forty-first year, the "Border Region" wanted to elect "Labor Heroes," investigating layer by layer, reporting to the higher-ups, and I was first. On May 1st of the forty-second year, I became a "Labor Hero." At that time, I was still afraid, didn't know what a "Labor Hero" was. Later, there was a welcome meeting, a total of five people in the entire "Border Region" were elected "Heroes," I was the first place. The "Border Region Government" awarded me a hoe and two shovels. I accepted them and went back to do my farming, working hard to increase production.</p>
<p>In 1943, Wu Manyou was elected as a member of the Yan'an City Council. When the reporter went to Yan'an last year, he saw his portrait hung on the wall with Zhu and Mao in the council. In the records of the council, his proposals were all considered important resolutions, such as "Cultivating Three Remaining One," "Labor Exchange Team," "Intensive Cultivation"... etc., in the process of "Increasing Production," they were all cited as slogans by the communists. Now, when talking to him about these things again, he still remembers them clearly, even the years and months, especially when talking about his proposal of "The Mare Should Not Support a Tall Husband Case." He smiled and said, "Because the mare has a foal, the chief doesn't feed the horse well, and blinds the foal too. I proposed this case entirely for the sake of the people. I am a commoner, of course I love the common people. I won't say anything to the public, but I truly put in effort for the people!"</p>
<p>Arrested in Binzhou</p>
<p>"Last December, I joined the supply station and was assigned to work in the health department of the Second Column. Later, I was assigned to the Sixth Column as the deputy captain of the stretcher team. Shit! What's there to be afraid of, I'm already a labor hero, so just be a deputy captain! In total, I led more than two hundred laborers, to Shibao, out of Huanglong Mountain, and was captured in Binzhou!"</p>
<p>Wu Manyou has two "lads," the older one is called Wu Zhongfu, 25 years old, now farming at home in Yan'an, the younger one is 20 years old this year, called Zhongguo. He joined the army the year before last, initially as a combatant, later as a "surveyor." Wu Manyou said, "The younger one has read books for a couple of days." Talking about them, although he said, "I don't miss them, thinking, 'shit,' they have all married wives and have two daughters, what's there to miss!" But from his face, one could see the deep affection of a parent for his children. This old man is still deeply missing his sons who are far away across the mountains.</p>
<p>Doesn't Want a Wife</p>
<p>The reporter asked about his thoughts on the lives of the people in Guanzhong. He immediately praised them, "It's good here, the land is better than in northern Shaanxi, the soil color is good, and the people are also free and easy, there are no worries when speaking. In northern Shaanxi, if there is a relationship, you have to look at the person. Actually, the government doesn't beat or scold, it's just that 'rectification' is bad!" As for the future, Wu Manyou said, "As long as there is land, what's there to be afraid of! I can labor for the government!" A training officer next to him said to find him a wife, so he could settle down in Guanzhong. He immediately laughed and shouted, "No, no, I'm already fifty-five years old, why would I want a wife?"</p>
<p>Expert Li Ruohai</p>
<p>General Li Ruohai, who manages the youth training headquarters, can be said to be an expert in training communists. He graduated from the fourth class of the military academy and started working on conversion in the "Labor Camp" in Xi'an. Decades of experience have enriched his life. When he talked to reporters about his experience, he only said one thing is "patience," and the other is "reason." As long as you can convince them, there is only one truth. As for the future of the team members, according to him, the record for the past two years is that more than 80% are transferred to the National Army, pointing their guns outwards, letting them atone for their sins on the battlefield. Higher-level personnel, after conversion, are either sent away with compensation, or assigned work in the rear after considering the situation.</p>
<p>Claims to be Wang Xicheng</p>
<p>The story of how Wu Manyou was discovered is very interesting. When the training team instructors were having individual conversations with the newly admitted team members, Wu Manyou claimed to be Wang Xicheng, from Luochuan, a squad leader in the laborer team. However, from his expression, the instructors judged that he was definitely not a squad leader, but possibly a mid-level "cadre." Later, some old team members came to report, saying that he looked like the "Hero" Wu Manyou. After several conversations, he still dodged and was vague, until early June, when he was moved by the life in the team and automatically freed himself from the communist propaganda, he admitted everything!</p>
<p>General Hu Zongnan summoned him to the residence of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, Xiaoyan Pagoda, on the evening of June 4th. But Wu Manyou again denied that he was Wu Manyou, saying that he was squad leader Wang Xicheng. General Hu did not delve into this, but as soon as he left the room, Mr. Hu told the senior subordinates of the Pacification Headquarters that he was Wu Manyou, because as soon as he sat on the sofa, he crossed his legs, with a calm and composed manner, which was something that a squad leader would never have. Now, when everyone talks about these things, the old man blushes and smiles sheepishly, saying, "I was too naughty."</p>
<p>Loud Appeal</p>
<p>From a landlord to a tenant farmer, then becoming a "hero" and now, Wu Manyou's path has been long and tortuous, full of wind and rain. The communists used honors, hoes, a cow... to make him an idol, using his appeal to successfully collect 160,000 to 200,000 "shi" of "patriotic public grain" from northern Shaanxi every year. Now, this simple villager is moved again by the National Army's generosity and material enjoyment. In addition to inviting him to give speeches, the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters is also preparing to print pamphlets for him. At the "Confession Meeting" on June 15th, he called on everyone to show their conscience and reveal their identities... His voice has become a loud appeal again in the training team.</p>
<p>Isn't Wu Manyou a good mirror to look at this era, to look at the achievements of the National Army's conversion work?</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an 1st Telegram] More than 8,400 bandits captured in the Wei North and Longdong area have been successively sent to a certain place in the southern suburbs of Xi'an and reorganized into the "Patriotic Youth Training Headquarters." The team members live freely in the team, and their daily life is similar to that of a militarized school. The team members' clothing, food and supplies are completely the same as those of the National Army. Some "red people," such as "Labor Hero" Wu Manyou, are also enrolled in the team for training.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Changhua 1st Telegram] Jingzhou Township, currently under the jurisdiction of Jixi County, Anhui, is located west of Changhua (Zhejiang) and southeast of Jixi (Anhui), surrounded by towering mountains and lush greenery, known as a paradise. Since our country established provinces and counties in the Qin Dynasty, it has been under the jurisdiction of Changhua County, Zhejiang. The township has a population of more than 8,000 people, who are diligent in farming and weaving, and live in peace. It was not until the 20th year of the Republic of China that the township was forcibly assigned to Jixi County due to personnel relations. However, the township is hundreds of miles away from the Jixi county seat, with rugged mountain roads. Government orders cannot reach it and the problem of public security is even more difficult to address. Therefore, it has become a land beyond the reach of the law. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China, it was spied on by the communists and repeatedly disturbed. In the New Year of the following year, it was occupied as a base, and activities were openly carried out. Since then, the township has been under the red terror, and has been subjected to tragic massacres and liquidations. Recently, it was learned that all the residents of the township are unable to work during the day and sleep at night, and are unable to bear the pain. They are also unwilling to be trapped in the township as a land without governance for a long time. Therefore, last month, they rose up to take self-rescue actions for the township. They felt that it was most reasonable and convenient for the township to return to Changhua in terms of geographical situation, customs, habits, government orders, and public security. Based on this reason, they launched the "Jingzhou Return to Changhua Movement" and appointed Hu Huatao, Hu Zhenwu, etc. to organize the "Jingzhou Return to Changhua Movement Committee," and set up an office in Bainiu Town, Changhua. They are now actively carrying out applications to the central government and relevant agencies in the province and county, and distributing telegrams on their behalf. (Telegram omitted)</p>
<p>At present, many residents of the township have moved to Changhua due to the inability to live in peace. It is also learned that if their application for the return of Jingzhou Township to Changhua is not approved, they will gather all the residents of the township to petition the central government, and will not give up until they achieve their goal.

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The reporter recently learned from the Pan American Airlines office here that Irish literary maverick George Bernard Shaw recently voluntarily revised an advertisement for the company's U.S. to Ireland route. This is the first time in Shaw's life that he has cooperated with the business community, which Pan American Airlines regards as an supreme honor. The advertisement introduces the scenery of Ireland, and Shaw personally wrote the following words:</p>
<p>"Ireland is wonderfully different,</p>
<p>Ireland's skies are different,</p>
<p>Ireland's air is different,</p>
<p>Living in the Irish climate for two years can turn the most stubborn and slow-witted minds into soft and agile ones."</p>
<p>Pan American initially intended to quote Shaw's words from a travel guide published in Ireland after the war, which read: "I am in paradise in Ireland. In such an infinitely quiet place, one cannot work, and I hope that we will not have to work in heaven." Pan American Airlines inquired about Shaw's consent for this, and Shaw replied that he had never said such a thing, so he changed and wrote the aforementioned sentence, and revised other words in the advertisement. Shaw was willing to write for Pan American Airlines for free entirely based on his patriotism, because he believed that this would encourage Americans to travel to Ireland and increase the country's foreign exchange income.

<h3 id="e105">From Grain Barn to Vast Expanse of Water: The Sorrowful Southern County Submerged by Continuous Rain <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Huang Chao-ru</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changsha, This Newspaper, 1st] Nan County is located in the heart of Dongting Lake, with a diameter of less than a hundred li. The county's total cultivated area is about 800,000 mu, with a population of over 280,000. Situated by the lake, it is considered the smallest and youngest county. The entire county consists of polder fields (垸田), with no high ground. Although it lacks famous mountains and clear waters, every spring and summer, the weeping willows along the banks and the seedlings in the polders transform Nan County into a beautiful green world. By early autumn, one sees only golden fields, and the granaries are full. Therefore, outsiders call it a "grain barn."</p>
<p>Moment of Great Prosperity Twenty Years Ago</p>
<p>Indeed, Nan County experienced a period of great prosperity over twenty years ago. At that time, all the polder fields were newly silted alluvial land, with fertile soil and relatively high elevation, reducing the threat of floods. Consequently, the yield was extremely abundant, mainly grain and cotton, with significant production of various other coarse grains. Due to the abundance of grain, supplementary industries such as pig, sheep, chicken, and duck farming were also quite developed. Furthermore, there was a large Datong Lake – an inner lake of Dongting Lake – producing approximately 100,000 dan of fish annually. Thus, the elegant name of "land of fish and rice" was bestowed upon Nan County.</p>
<p>Only Fear of Squeezing the Milk from a Fat Sheep</p>
<p>Although Nan County is a small county, it made a significant contribution to the nation during the long periods of the Eight-Year War of Resistance and the Three-Year Civil War. Since the implementation of the conscription system, it has never failed to meet its quota. The land tax burden was particularly heavy, with annual real tax collections reaching over 600,000 shi, accounting for one-thirteenth of the entire Hunan province, even more than the entire Guangxi province. The people of Nan County could barely breathe under the burden of land taxes. However, they always endured, gritted their teeth, and waited for the mercy of heaven to grant them a good harvest, which is akin to squeezing as much milk as possible from a fat sheep. As long as the sheep can grow fat. If there is not enough nutritious feed for the sheep and only dry grass is given to it to satisfy its hunger, and you still squeeze milk from it, then this sheep will only die of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Flooded Farmlands Increase Yearly</p>
<p>Nan County has crisscrossing rivers, which were previously considered convenient for irrigation. However, in recent years, the riverbed has gradually silted up as the river water carries silt downstream. The elevation within the polders has gradually lowered, and the area of flooded farmlands has increased year by year. In the past, this area was occupied by the enemy three times. Combined with the impact of an excessively heavy burden, its vitality was exhausted, and it lacked the capacity to build water conservancy projects. Although it repeatedly appealed to the government, requesting a little fresh grass feed for this sold sheep and providing relief, the sheep cried itself hoarse, but the listener remained unmoved. Therefore, the polder fields of Nan County now completely rely on the mercy of heaven. During spring droughts, there is no water for transplanting rice seedlings; during summer rains, the area turns into a swamp. It is no longer the worry-free grain barn of the past.</p>
<p>Accumulated Water in the Polders Cannot Be Drained</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring this year, continuous rain has persisted for months. The accumulated water in the polders cannot be drained, and the fields and house foundations have become a vast expanse of water. The situation of families floating with their belongings is exceptionally miserable. This year, this area not only suffered from floods but also experienced an unprecedented windstorm. The disaster area is vast, and the losses are heavy. It is pitiful that the surviving people have already lost everything they have. According to county government statistics, the flooded and wind-damaged area covers over 560,000 mu, with over 150,000 people affected. Over 7,900 houses were damaged or collapsed due to the wind and flood, and 168 boats were sunk or damaged.</p>
<p>Upstream Mountain Torrent Outburst Is Feared</p>
<p>Although the continuous rain has stopped, the accumulated water still cannot be drained, and late rice still cannot be replanted. Moreover, there is an even more worrying matter that concerns everyone. During the last spring rain disaster, the upstream mountain torrents did not yet erupt. Considering the thick snow accumulation from last winter, there may still be a mountain torrent disaster this summer. If unfortunately followed by another mountain torrent outburst, then this grain barn in Dongting Lake will be in danger of being completely destroyed. The Chinese people rely on the bodhisattva for protection. Other than that, they seem helpless. Now, the farmers by the lake are burning incense and praying that there will be no more floods. However, the bodhisattva is ultimately an elusive figure. Whether it is efficacious is truly only "heaven knows!"</p>

<p>To cooperate with the municipal authorities in stabilizing prices and combating speculation, the Shanghai Financial Administration (SFA) has, since June 20th, dispatched personnel in batches to the check clearing house to inspect large-value check exchanges. Based on this information, they went to various exchange firms to investigate relevant companies and businesses, and the preliminary investigation has been completed. The SFA has submitted the inspection results to the Shanghai Municipal Government for joint investigation to determine whether these companies and businesses are genuine merchants and whether the purpose of issuing large-value checks is legitimate. If any violations or speculative activities are discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law. Furthermore, the SFA has previously issued a strict ban on customers issuing bad checks. In addition to the customers who issued bad checks in the past being punished separately by the SFA and reported to the authorities by various firms in accordance with the law, according to the SFA's inspection statistics, approximately 20 clients of various firms had insufficient funds or overdrawn accounts in June, resulting in bounced checks. The SFA has instructed the various firms to cease business with these clients and to report them directly to the court in accordance with the law to rectify the situation. It is now learned that with the end of the semi-annual settlement period at the end of June, the SFA, in order to strengthen the inspection of firms and prevent market fluctuations, has, in addition to continuing to cooperate with the municipal government in investigating companies and businesses, borrowed personnel from the Central Bank of China to conduct surprise inspections of various firms starting from July 3rd. Thirty firms are inspected daily. In addition, it has been ordered that transfer application forms should be limited to inter-bank use and should not be used at the request of customers to reduce the speed of currency circulation. The SFA has instructed the three industry associations of banking, money, and trust companies to inform various firms to strictly comply.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Unstable Domestic Situation Affects New Exchange Settlement Method <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>More than a month has passed since the announcement of the new exchange settlement method. Exports have indeed been promoted, and the quantity of exports has also increased. However, the actual situation still does not meet expectations. (1) Export smuggling is still rampant; (2) Import and export revenues and expenditures still cannot be balanced; (3) Overseas remittances still cannot be attracted. The reason for this is entirely due to the fact that the market price of the exchange settlement certificate is far from the black market exchange rate, and the gap often remains above two-fifths, resulting in the above three phenomena. The formation of this phenomenon is due to the unstable domestic situation and the failure of the economic situation to improve. Some people believe that the new exchange settlement method should be re-examined and properly applied in order to change the situation.</p>

<p>Tang Jusheng Explains Intended Restrictions, Difficult to Accept Alternative Proposals</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation to Japan previously stipulated that when private traders negotiate purchase contracts with Japanese merchants, they should first prepare export materials of equal value to the imported goods. After investigation and verification by the China Trust Bureau, a guarantee would be issued. The traders believed that this measure would lead to the stagnation of funds and sent representatives back to China to request the government to change it. According to Tang Jusheng, the commercial commissioner of the delegation, this restriction is intended to maintain the credit of the Chinese government and merchants abroad in order to avoid any possibility of forming debt. If goods are not exchanged for money, they must be exchanged for materials. This is a clear principle. Moreover, the current trade between merchants and Japan is guaranteed by the government through bookkeeping. If they form debt, wouldn't the government have to repay it on their behalf? Therefore, the government finds it difficult to accept the proposed changes.</p>

<p>Under Review, Announcement Scheduled for the 5th</p>
<p>It is reported that this month's coal ration price will inevitably increase due to the soaring prices of goods in mining areas. For example, the price of flour in June increased by 35% compared to May. Hardware materials and kiln wood must be purchased with foreign exchange, and the sum of the official exchange rate and the transaction price of the exchange settlement certificate must also be more than 2.4 million. Transportation costs have increased by approximately 35%, and other miscellaneous expenses have increased by approximately 20%. A portion of wages must be increased by 100% according to the cost of living index.</p>
<p>According to the Fuel Management Committee, based on the above increase rates, the price of rationed coal for this month must be increased by at least 150%. Last month's ration price was 12.55 million, which means an increase of one and a half times. Even then, it would still be half cheaper than the current black market price of coal. The committee is confident that the supply of coal in this city will not be scarce. However, the prices for various coal rations for this month are still under review and will be officially announced on the 5th.</p>

<p>Raw Silk Processing Fee Loan of 210 Million First</p>
<p>The purchase of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has ended. The Silk Guidance Association is currently compiling the cocoon purchase reports from the two provinces and submitting them to the Joint Treasury and the relevant authorities for review. At the same time, the Agricultural Bank will start to approve raw silk processing fees for manufacturers who have already completed their work next week, first approving 210 million per dan.

<h3 id="e112">Increase in Gasoline Ration <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Gasoline is the main raw material used by the rubber industry to dissolve and mix rubber. The gasoline required by the rubber industry in this city is supplied by Asia, Mobil, Texaco, and China Petroleum Company. According to the investigation, each ton of rubber requires 170 gallons of gasoline. The actual ration was reduced to 120 gallons. After the establishment of the City Gasoline Distribution Committee last month, it was further reduced by 60%, allowing 72 gallons of gasoline per ton of rubber. However, due to various excuses by oil merchants, the ration in May was extremely small, and there was none in June. If this continues, the industry will not be able to survive. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Supervisory and Management Office of the National Economic Council, requesting them to forward it to the City Gasoline Distribution Committee to re-examine the gasoline required by the industry, maintain the minimum usage originally approved by the Industrial Assistance Office, and hope that it can be evenly distributed with gasoline for transportation to maintain production.</p>

<p>The Tobacco Leaf Commercial Association previously requested the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance to consult the Customs Administration to order the Jianghai Customs to issue duplicate copies of export permits for tobacco leaf exports to be used as proof of application for tax refunds to the tax bureau.

Therefore, in the future, tobacco leaf export sales, tobacco merchants can ask the association to prepare a document and directly request the Jianghai Customs to issue duplicate copies of export permits to obtain tax refunds and avoid complicated procedures.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Washington, This Newspaper] The United States' tung oil imports mainly come from China, and China's tung oil exports are mainly to the United States. Foreign exchange earnings last year reached approximately 30 million U.S. dollars. Previously, due to the sharp drop in tung oil prices in the United States, the Tung Oil Producers Association of that country believed that this was due to China's dumping of tung oil to the United States and formally requested the U.S. government to impose anti-dumping duties on China's tung oil to resist it. If this becomes a reality, China's tung oil exports will be greatly affected. The U.S. Customs's order to pay guarantees for tung oil imports from China has also caused China's tung oil exports to decrease significantly. The Chinese government and tung oil exporters are very anxious about this. My country's commercial counselor's office in the United States also believes that this matter is of great importance and specially negotiated or explained with the various departments of the U.S. Foreign, Treasury, Agriculture and Commerce Departments. However, this matter involves many issues. In addition to price, it is also related to the U.S. party election. The office negotiated with the U.S. government on the one hand, contacted tung oil consumers who opposed taxation on the other hand, and requested legislators who opposed taxation to use their political skills to assist from the side. It is now learned that the U.S. government has rejected this anti-dumping request and canceled the previous customs's method of requiring guarantees for tung oil imports from China.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] In the Sino-Philippine Baseball Friendship Games, held at the racecourse yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Manila Red Sox team defeated the home team China by a score of 5-0 in front of hundreds of Chinese and foreign dignitaries. Before the game, the Chinese team presented a banner as a souvenir. Mayor Wu could not attend due to official business and was replaced by Zhang Bide, the head of the municipal government's public relations section, who threw the ball to Filipino Vice Consul Garcia to express welcome to the sports ambassador.</p>
<p>Elusive Red Sox Score</p>
<p>The battle began with Zhang Bide and Garcia's throw and catch. China yielded, and the visiting team attacked first. Lei Mengdu reached first base with a bunt, and advanced to second base thanks to Reid's base hit. Parres hit an extremely swift and low ball, which was caught by shortstop Liang Yousheng with an excellent play. He quickly threw to second base, and then to first base, resulting in a double play. However, Lei Mengdu stole a point due to a mistake by catcher He Jinben. China countered, but Red Sox A. Ocena's pitching, spinning left and right, was elusive and unpredictable. However, Liang Wenyi, He Jingui, and Liang Youwen were able to barely hit the ball, but unfortunately, they were too soft and did not gain anything. In the second, third, and fourth innings, both sides were heavily guarded, and there were no opportunities to get on base.</p>
<p>Two to Zero</p>
<p>In the fifth inning, Red Sox Xiao Ocena got on base with a base hit, and Le Mosi hit a double, Xiao Ocena rushed back to home plate, but was killed by the He brothers with lightning speed. A. Ocena attacked, Le Mishi took the opportunity to score a point, making it two to zero. China's Liang Yousheng and Bao Guanda were eliminated one after another. Although He Jinben advanced to third base due to a technical foul by the Philippine side, the hope of scoring was dashed because Yu Chang was struck out.</p>
<p>In the sixth inning, Reid was thrown out by Yu Changluan, Parres was caught by Zhong Baoluo, and Rosa was forced out by Liang Yousheng. China was three up and three down.</p>
<p>Losing Three Points in a Row</p>
<p>In the final inning, the Chinese defense was slightly relaxed, and Gu Angka, Le Moshi, and Xiao Ocena scored three points in succession. The counterattack was unsuccessful, and they lost 0-5. The scores of each inning are as follows:</p>
<p>Red Sox</p>
<p>Inning</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>1 0 0 0 1 0 3</p>
<p>(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)</p>
<p>0 0 0 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Total 5 Total 0</p>
<p>Showboating</p>
<p>Overall, the Red Sox's defensive skills can be considered tight, but their offense does not have any special strengths. Moreover, because they are a semi-professional team, they often show exaggerated performances. Such performances are understandable in professional games to attract audiences, but in international competitions to promote friendship and connect feelings, they violate the spirit of sports and run counter to the original purpose.

<p>Infant Boy Dies After Birth; Father Writes to Medical Community for Research</p>
<p>To all doctors and staff at Nanjing Central Hospital and doctors and nurses at hospitals across the country:</p>
<p>For days, newspapers have been reporting on the strange case of a deformed baby at Nanjing Central Hospital. Unfortunately, my son, Shengzu, died tragically at 2:55 AM on the 24th due to excessive stomach bleeding. In my sorrow, I have written down the points worth studying for doctors to research.</p>
<p>After my son's death, Dr. Xu performed an autopsy and concluded that the cause of death was stomach bleeding. Dr. Xu said, "The cause of the stomach bleeding was that after the surgery, he stopped eating, and the stomach lining rubbed against itself, causing the stomach wall to be injured, leading to excessive bleeding and death." This statement is worth studying to clarify responsibility. Today's newspapers reported that it was a stomach ulcer, which I believe is a misreport by the reporter. Before my son was admitted to the hospital, he was no different from a normal child. The X-ray examination did not reveal any other changes in his stomach. How could he have stomach ulcers? Moreover, from the surgery to his last breath, his temperature was normal, and his mind was clear. Whether this bleeding was related to the gastric lavage surgery is also a major cause of death and should be studied.</p>
<p>As my son gradually slipped into a coma, my wife urgently asked the nurse to call a doctor, but the nurse was annoyed, and the doctor delayed the consultation for three hours, and it was too late to save him. Stomach bleeding is not incurable in the early stages. The nurse's obstruction and the doctor's delay are to blame!</p>
<p>During the autopsy, there was a fist-sized black blood clot inside the incision line, witnessed by my relative Sun Yusu. I don't know if this blood is related to my son's death. I hope the doctors will study it.</p>
<p>Finally, I am grateful to Miss Yao of the Social Service Department of Central Hospital for granting a 30% discount on the payment. Thank you.</p>
<p>He Weiwen from Wujin, respectfully, 37.6, 25, under the lamp</p>

<p>The Misfortune of Works in "Free Talk" Shuang Lu</p>
<p>The British publication "New Writing," edited by John Lehmann, contains many good articles, especially those introducing works from the European continent, which are valuable. Europe is in suffering, and we only hear news of their material shortages. Who pays attention to their spiritual achievements?</p>
<p>The writer saw the latest issue of "New Writing," Volume 33, which includes Gide's notes, Paul Valéry's essays, and a short story by Italian writer Antonio Bottoni, "The Man Who Escaped from the Moon," which is also a good piece.</p>
<p>But what makes me most emotional is the editor Lehmann's preface at the beginning of the volume, which includes this passage: "The purpose of 'New Writing' is not only to provide works by modern European writers, but also to introduce things by English writers overseas, and American writers are no exception. During the war, our opportunities were few, but we still overcame difficulties and occasionally published novels, poems, and essays by outstanding people from France, Greece, and Czechoslovakia. There are not many writers from the autonomous regions... However, the appearance of American works is really rare, although the editor is very welcome to contribute. But this is just our unrequited love, or is it because the editors of American magazines are standing in our way, waving stacks of American dollar bills to confuse people?..."</p>
<p>Lehmann's emotion is a bit like a poor man sighing. In fact, the standard of "New Writing" is much higher than that of general American publications. Lehmann does not particularly value American works, but for the sake of the "colorful" content of the publication, he wants to invite writers from across the Atlantic to "join in the grand event." However, it is not possible. American famous writers do not lack gold pounds, but British famous writers lack dollars, such as Shaw, in addition to submitting short letters to the Times letter column, a short article must also be published in the United States. How great is the magic of American dollar bills?</p>
<p>American writers are too tempted by money, and most of their works are decadent. The most obvious phenomenon is the popularity of vulgar love stories and absurd detective novels. Although the printing is beautiful and the illustrations are colorful, what relationship do they have with real life?</p>
<p>In politics, like England and France, they worship under the skirts of the "beauty," but in intellectual circles, the evaluation of the "beauty" is different. American publishers are willing to pay high prices, but they want you to cater to their low tastes. But what about the Chinese publishing industry? Not to mention the taste, but they do everything possible to be harsh on writers, resulting in a group of writing slaves living a half-dead life. Alas!</p>
<p>On Appropriateness Jin Jin</p>
<p>To explain this topic, it is useful to use clothing as a metaphor. It is said that there are master tailors who can maximize the beauty of the physique when making clothes, such as broad shoulders, tall stature, etc., while minimizing various flaws, such as flat chest, protruding abdomen, etc. I have also heard that fancy clothing stores overseas make a wire hanger according to the dimensions of each part of the human body, and sew according to this hanger. Naturally, it will fit perfectly when worn.</p>
<p>But such appropriateness is often very difficult. Not only must a lot of effort be spent on sewing, but also attention must be paid to various details. I recently made a set of clothes, and after modifying it horizontally and vertically, I still couldn't be satisfied. Broadly speaking, it is really difficult to make any person or thing in the world match their identity or achieve perfection. An actor who deliberately imitates the appearance of a worker may forget to apply makeup to his snow-white hands.</p>
<p>Similar situations, even the emperor of Abyssinia, were considered regrettable by foreign reporters. An American writer quoted an anecdote about Emperor Haile Selassie in a magazine published in December 1947: Emperor Haile Selassie visited England in 1936. The emperor sat high in an open-top carriage, nodding and smiling to the thousands of Londoners cheering along the way. He suddenly unexpectedly flicked his snot into the air, which embarrassed the British reception staff who were attending the emperor.</p>
<p>The implication is that the emperor should be appropriate to the emperor's identity. His act of flicking his snot is still cited as conversation material eleven or twelve years later.</p>
<p>Originally, the habits of the people of Abyssinia may not be consistent with those of the British and Americans. We cannot criticize the emperor for this. The British and Americans also have their own cumbersome etiquette. There are thick books dedicated to "etiquette." Indeed, the British and Americans' pursuit of "appropriateness" and "meticulousness" in science and efficiency can make people admire them.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Chinese, they are much more lenient about everything. Most of what we see and hear is "not seeking thorough understanding," "just fulfilling the responsibility," and "careless." The word "appropriateness" has mostly been erased from the dictionary, and overemphasizing appropriateness seems close to being demanding. Indeed, in these years, our lives are very busy, and even if we want to "nitpick," we hardly have the leisure to "split hairs."</p>
<p>Comparison of Official Salaries Between China and the United States Yi Yun</p>
<p>The current official salary table of the United States federal government was revised by the government after World War II when prices rose sharply. The salary amounts are calculated on an annual basis. The table is divided into four categories: (1) Professional category: All engineers, technicians, doctors, etc. are included. (2) Semi-professional category: All surveyors, draftsmen, supervisors, and nurses, etc. are included. (3) Literary, medical, financial, and management category: All non-technical personnel who handle typing, receiving and sending, managing files, literary, medical, administrative, accounting, and administrative management are included. (4) Technician and security category: All drivers, electricians, gate guards, guards, etc. are included. The salary for the first category is divided into eight levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $2,644.80, and the highest salary is $3,397.20. If promoted to the highest level, it is $9,975.00 to $10,000.00. The salary for the second category is also divided into eight levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $1,690.00, and the highest salary is $2,093.04. If promoted to the highest level, it is $3,397.20 to $4,149.60. The salary for the third category is divided into fifteen levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $1,756.00, and the highest salary is $2,168.28. If promoted to the highest level, it is the same as the first category. The salary for the fourth category is divided into ten levels. The lowest salary for the initial level is $1,080.00, and the highest salary is $1,402.00. If promoted to the highest level, it is $3,648.00 to $4,400.40. According to the above salary amounts, the first category has the most initial pay, followed by the third category, and the salaries for these two categories are the same when promoted to the highest level. The fourth category has the least initial pay. The lowest salary is only $1,080.00, which is less than half of the initial lowest salary of $2,644.80 for the first category. It can be seen that the status of gate guards and mechanics is humble, and they cannot be compared with professional personnel who cannot be employed without a university degree. (The United States stipulates that the first category must have a university degree. If they have a master's or doctoral degree, they can receive a higher salary when they are first assigned.)</p>
<p>Now, let's compare our country's current official salary table with that of the United States. The salary for the first level of appointment in our country (that is, the highest salary for appointment) is a monthly salary of 200 yuan, which is 19.74 million legal currency based on the June cost of living index of 420,000 times in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The salary for the first level of recommendation is a monthly salary of 400 yuan, which is 28.14 million legal currency based on the above cost of living index. The salary for the first level of simple appointment is a monthly salary of 680 yuan, which is 39.9 million legal currency based on the above cost of living index. If we overestimate our strength and compare the highest salary of simple appointment with the highest salary of the first and third categories in the United States, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The highest monthly salary for simple appointment in our country is 680 yuan - calculated at 420,000 times, it is 39.9 million yuan - converted to US dollars at the official price of 459.780, it is only more than 86 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The highest annual salary for the first and third categories in the United States is 10,000 US dollars - equivalent to a monthly salary of more than 833 US dollars, which is about 382.99 million legal currency when converted at the official price of 459.780.</p>
<p>Looking at the above situation, we can see that according to this comparison, it is less than one-tenth. It is too unrealistic to compare with them. We can only lower our standards and compare with their fourth category of gate guards and mechanics. The result is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The initial minimum annual salary for gate guards and mechanics in the United States is 1,080 US dollars, equivalent to a monthly salary of 90 US dollars - converted to legal currency at the above official price, it is about a monthly salary of more than 41.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The highest monthly salary for simple appointment in our country is only more than 39 million yuan, which is inferior to them. If compared with the highest monthly salary of more than 28 million yuan for recommendation, it is even more unreachable. If compared with the highest monthly salary of more than 19 million yuan for appointment, it is less than half.</p>
<p>According to the United States, civil servants still feel that their treatment is meager, far less than the income of employees in private enterprises, so it is no wonder that civil servants in our country are so poor that they commit suicide.</p>
<p>"Medicine" and Plum Juice Yu Mojun</p>
<p>In summer, farmers drink cold water to quench their thirst, while urban people have the blessings of eating watermelon, drinking soda or Coca-Cola, and tasting ice cream. There is also a kind of drink called plum juice, which is priced by the cup and can be seen everywhere, and is always advertised as Beijing plum juice, because the one made in Beijing is the best. It is not easy to verify who invented this soup, but it is really "ancient."</p>
<p>According to today's plum juice, it is the ancient "medicine" (qu shang). Opening the "Rites of Zhou," whether it is "four drinks" or "six drinks," there is "medicine." "Rites of Zhou, Heavenly Official, Wine Administration" says: "Distinguish the materials of four drinks, the second is 'medicine.'" The annotation says, "Liqueur is turbid, brewed to make fine wine, so it is a little clearer." According to "Yu Pian," fine wine is clear wine. According to this, "medicine" is today's inlaid wine, such as Zhuangyuanhong inlaid with bamboo leaf green, which is wine and not a summer drink.</p>
<p>Also according to "Rites of Zhou": "Jiang Ren is in charge of six drinks," and the fifth is "medicine." Zheng Zhu thinks that plum sauce can generate fluid and quench thirst, which is the beginning of today's plum juice. However, plum sauce is too thick and greasy, so there is "yi." There is the sentence "jiang yi shui yi lan" in "Li Ji Nei Ze"; the note says that yi is plum syrup. According to the fact that syrup is much thinner than sauce, the making of "yi" must use "medicine" as the raw material, and then add water without a doubt, which is today's plum juice.</p>
<p>A Portrait of a Thief Chen Xiang</p>
<p>"That's a terribly bad portrait, I refuse to pay." After making this harsh judgment, Mr. Allie-Maire Keeling turned and left the young Hungarian painter Arpad Debesy's studio.</p>
<p>Weeks of time were wasted, and the five hundred yuan fee was lost. Sabisi painfully remembered that this rich man was too busy to allow him to paint his face only three times, so the entire portrait was almost entirely painted from memory. Still, it was very similar.</p>
<p>"Please stay a moment!" he shouted, "Would you write me a letter saying: You refuse to accept this portrait because it doesn't look like you?" The rich man did not expect to get away so easily, so he readily agreed.</p>
<p>Months later, the "Hungarian Painters Association" held an exhibition in the art gallery of the Hungarian capital. Shortly after the opening, Keeling's phone rang. Within half an hour, he appeared at the gallery and went straight to the side where Sabisi's works were displayed. There was the portrait he had refused to accept.</p>
<p>At a glance, his face turned purple. He stormed into the gallery manager's office, demanding that the portrait be removed immediately. The manager calmly explained that all the works were contracted to be exhibited in the gallery for a full six weeks.</p>
<p>"But this will make me the laughingstock of the whole capital," Keeling roared angrily, "This is a public insult, I'm going to sue."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," the manager warned, taking out the letter Keeling had written at Sabisi's request. "You yourself admitted that the painting doesn't look like you," he said coldly, "so you have no right to interfere with its disposal."</p>
<p>In despair, Keeling had to pay to buy the book. At this time, he realized that the price was ten times the original. In order to maintain his reputation, Keeling painfully signed a five thousand yuan check.</p>
<p>Sabisi used a little trick to not only sell the portrait that was rejected for alimony back to the person who commissioned it, but also to vent his anger. Originally, when exhibiting, he also added such a title to the painting - "Portrait of a Thief".</p>
<p>The examination system has a long history and has an important relationship with politics, culture, and society. Throughout the dynasties, it has been called "a great ceremony for selecting talents," and has been taken extremely seriously. However, there has never been a government agency specifically responsible for this matter, which is surprising. It has existed since the establishment of the "Examination Yuan" by the national government according to the intention of the five-power constitution.</p>
<p>According to "a great ceremony for selecting talents," the scale of the Tang Dynasty was roughly complete, and the Song Dynasty repeatedly repaired it. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, the palace examination, the township examination, the provincial examination, and the annual examination, as well as the进士, the 举人, the 買生, the 生員, were divided into grades, and the examination halls and fame were fully prepared. However, at that time, the Ministry of Rites was the most closely related to the examination among the six ministries of the government. The Ministry of Rites was responsible for ceremonies, and managed court meetings, sacrifices, ancestral halls, and even the imperial tombs and the custody of official seals. Although it managed the affairs of the examination halls, its name did not match the reality. Also, the origin of the examination was not correct. The Tang History can be verified. In March of the twenty-fourth year of Kaiyuan, "The servant of the Ministry of Rites was ordered to be in charge of the examination." Because a former Ministry of Civil Service personnel outside the Ministry of Civil Service was in charge of the examination, there was a 進士 who insulted him, and those who discussed it thought that the position of the personnel outside the Ministry of Civil Service was too low to be able to convince the public, so the Emperor ordered the servant of the Ministry of Rites". At first, it was only because the official position of the servant of the Ministry of Rites was larger than that of the personnel outside the Ministry of Civil Service, which was a matter of stronger system, not that the official of the ceremony was naturally in charge of the imperial examination and other matters.</p>
<p>In fact, the Ministry of Rites of the Qing Dynasty was the hub for managing the large and small examination halls and academic fame. The provincial education officers' examination of scholars, the examination of tribute students, and the affairs of the prefectural and county schools must be reported to the Ministry of Rites in books to supervise their achievements. For major matters, the chief examiners of the township examination were appointed by the Ministry of Rites upon request to the Emperor. After the examination was completed, the provincial treasurers compiled and submitted the examination papers to the Ministry of Rites. By the spring of the following year, the new and old 举人 from all provinces of the country gathered in the capital to respond to the "metropolitan examination," and the Ministry of Rites was even busier. The examiners (that is, the chief compilers), the co-examiners (that is, the co-editors), the "knowledge tribute officials (that is, the ministers in charge of the entire examination hall), and the distribution of all matters, large and small, in the examination hall, so the metropolitan examination was also called the "Ministry of Rites Examination" or the "Spring Official Examination." Those who are named on this examination list can respond to the palace examination (that is, the Emperor's personal examination, the so-called "listening to the advice of the scholar"). Therefore, the hard work of the cold window, becoming famous in one fell swoop, reached the peak of academic fame. The above only lists the outline, and the details are very complicated and cannot be listed in detail. The Ministry of Rites is so closely related to the examination, but its name has nothing to do with the "examination." The various departments in the ministry, such as the Department of Ritual System (in charge of court meetings and clothing marriage), the Department of Ancestral Sacrifices (in charge of temple sacrifices, funerals, pensions, issuing almanacs, monks, Taoists, temples), the Department of Guests (in charge of tributes from various countries and tributes from various places, grace and rewards), the Department of Refined Meals (in charge of banquets and the number of cattle and sheep), the Bureau of Minting Seals (in charge of the manufacture of official seals, large and small, for various ministries and provinces), and there is no name for managing the examination halls or examinations.</p>
<p>Because the transfer of the imperial examination to the Ministry of Rites in the Tang Dynasty was a temporary measure. If we examine it carefully, it is not as meaningful as the affiliation to "performance evaluation" at the beginning. Performance evaluation is a division of the Ministry of History. The Ministry of History is responsible for the selection of officials and history, and the evaluation of the hundred officials. The selection of talents was originally for the purpose of employing virtuous and talented people, so the contribution and selection are similar (closer to the ceremony). And now the old examination institute is related to the selection and narrative, the name and reality are consistent, and the system is correct. In terms of regulations, it is much more complete than the previous generation.</p>
<p>Written on a Boat Returning Home Zhang Wei</p>
<p>Repeating the original rhyme of Mr. Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>The blue sea is vast, connecting the water to the sky,</p>
<p>Looking back at my hometown, it should still be the same.</p>
<p>My heart to return is more urgent than the evening tide,</p>
<p>Returning to comfort my loving mother in her old age.</p>
<p>How dare I drift with the world,</p>
<p>My seven-foot body strives to remain strong.</p>
<p>Even if it is difficult to distinguish the five turbidities in the evil world,</p>
<p>There is still a clear stream in the empty mountain.</p>
<p>When realized, everywhere is a pot of heaven,</p>
<p>The heavens and the people are all natural.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the legacy is left after the disaster,</p>
<p>Warming books and closing doors for a long year.</p>
<p>Lightly equipped, I floated on a boat with my mother,</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to leave the prosperity of the city,</p>
<p>The rise and fall of dynasties have become the past,</p>
<p>Only the river water still flows east today.</p>
