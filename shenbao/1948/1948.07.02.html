<h3>立院今開秘密會議　討論國家總預算案　物價問題亦將提出檢討</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立法院長孫科，一日下午五時招待記者，籲請對該院會議機密之保持予以協助。孫氏首聲明，招待會旨在根據院會決議，代表立委同人與記者交換該院新聞發布之意見，決無其他用意，請勿誤會。旋解釋該院依法舉行秘密會議，謝絕旁聽，乃為避免將不應公開或未至公開時機之討論事項宣揚院外，發生不良影響。且消息之片斷發布，易滋誤解，為國家安全，社會安定，故不得不仿照一般行政性會議之秘密舉行。六月廿四日臨時會議，涉及軍事機密，應防止洩露予敵人得悉，而所有足以刺戟物價，危害一般人生活及國家財政之消息，自當儘量避免登載。渠以個人之立塲認為秘密會議容易引起猜測謠諑，使人心憂慮，應公開為宜，而一國議會在平時舉行秘密會議實屬例外，蓋公開庶政，取信人民，乃民主國家根本原則，但如國家遭逢禍亂時，為國家安全，自不得不舉行秘密會議。孫氏複闡明二日之秘密會議，乃為聽取政府關於下半年預算編製之報吿，為使政院報吿暢所欲言，俾立院可得充分瞭解，故有此項措施。渠謂：會議雖稱秘密，但會議情形記者當然可能知悉，但請暫放心中，俟有決定後，再行報道。至此，渠以英國前財相道爾頓之辭職為例，指出民主國家議會對預算案之重視。英例預算案在下院提出後即可公諸全國，然我國行憲伊始，立院為昭愼重，乃決定俟有決議時，再對社會公開，此為避免刺激人心，影響物價而採取之非常時期措施。同時，會中對物價問題，亦將予以檢討，亦盼記者帮忙，協同保守機密。孫氏語末，强調民主國家中新聞界與讓會關係密切，我國民主政治之發展，尤賴記者等與立院同人加强聯繫，共同努力。最後並接納記者多人建議，對以後採訪該院新聞，儘量予以可能方便。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立法院第一會期第二次秘密會議，定二日晨九時舉行，討論卅七年下半年度中央政府歲入歲出總預算案。普通部門總預算草案及施行條例草案，業經政院附同施政方針，施政計劃與編審辦法咨送立院，特別歲入歲出預算草案，亦已另案提出，政院翁院長將偕主計長徐堪，財長王雲五列席，說明有關總預算案編製之各事項。同時，並報吿物價飛漲問題，央行總裁兪鴻鈞亦被邀列席，以備質詢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕國民黨籍立委，一日下午三時在中央黨部舉行談話會，就政院行將提出之總預算案交換意見，負責主管之翁文灝·張厲生·王雲五·徐堪等均列席，將總預算案提出作詳盡說明，各立委亦提供若干意見，至下午五時許始散。</p>
<h3>中美雙邊協定　明日在京簽字　王世杰司徒雷登代表兩國簽署</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕中美兩國政府關於美援華款項使用原則之中美雙邊協定，原定二日簽字，現以某項技術問題，決延遲至七月三日，由王部長世杰，美大使司徒雷登代表中美兩國政府在京簽字，屆時將行簽署之文件有三：計中美雙邊協定本件及換文·附件各一。記者自關係方面獲悉。七月三日所簽署之「協定」內容，包括美援之經濟援助款項二億七千五百萬美元及是項內所包括之特種建般費用六千萬美元，以及農業復興費用諸般使用之原則。協定並包括前言一節，說明美援華法案之精神。「附件」則包括「協定」中若干名詞之釋義，及補助說明，另悉：自美國國會四月三日通過之援外法案包括援華法案，嗣於四月卅日我駐美大使在美與美舉行換文，成立臨時協定之後，我政府即與美方積極交涉，進行是項正式協定之締定。而根據前項中美換文，七月三日則為締定及簽署是項協定之最後時限，凡關於中美雙邊協定之商討，大部均於南京進行。變方就草案中條款之更變計三次，文字之斟酌逾七八度，而末次雙方協議之草案，經美大使館於六月廿九日晨電達華盛頓徵詢最後指示之後，卒因某項技術問題之細節，仍未獲全然一致之協議。惟據今一日晚其權威觀察家語記者稱：相信是項技術問題之歧見，日內即可解決，絕不致影響三日之簽字。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕美經濟合作局駐華代表賴普漢，巳於昨日上午飛京，參興七月三日中美雙邊協定之簽訂。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕總統七月一日頒布命令：（一）特派外交部長王世杰為議訂中美關於美國援華雙邊協定全權代表。（三）派張鴻鈞為出席國際兒童緊急救濟基金會會議代表。（三）兼國際貨幣基金及國際復興建設銀行理事兪鴻鈞呈請辭職，准免兼職。（四）派王雲五兼國際貨幣基金及國際復興建設行理事。</p>
<h3>霍夫曼談話</h3>
<p>經濟援華工作順利　改革幣制可予商談</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓卅日電〕經濟合作局執行長官霍夫曼宣稱，中美雙邊協定將於數日內簽定。霍氏對參議員勃里奇抨擊國務院謂其擱置軍事援華計劃一事，拒作批評。但渠謂：經濟援華工作進行順利。按經濟合作局第一季之工作，已瀕結束，故霍氏今稱第一季中未交付之分配物資，將由該局自動併入第二季分配量中。我國在第一季中所獲分配物資，總値為三千六百五十萬美元，但其中僅價値二千六百五十萬元之物資，已交付我國。據悉：該局第二季分配於我國之物資，約値八千萬美元，霍氏並稱：各雙邊協定中雖未明文規定，但經濟合作局有權請參加馬歇爾計劃之各國，作關於改革幣制之商談，但美國無意干涉該國之內政，故願由各國自行從事其所需之幣制改革。霍氏稱：經濟合作局之地位與投資銀行家同，故該局投資後，而受援國復原工作不能滿意，則合作局可停止其援助，或請該國匡正阻碍其發展之局勢。霍夫曼就簽訂雙邊協定發表正式聲明謂：此一計劃之成敗，將視大西洋彼岸同志之努力如何而定。</p>
<h3>史蒂爾曼調查團　昨研究考察結果</h3>
<p>王日赴杭視察浙贛路</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕史蒂爾曼調査團昨整日會議，研究各地考察之結果。</p>
<p>〔本報南昌一日電〕史蒂爾曼等一行，定五日由涊赴杭視察浙贛鐵路。侯家源已赴滬，將陪同來贛。該團於六日來贛途中，將在蕭山，玉山視察該路兩機廠。七日上午到達南昌後，即轉樟樹視察大橋工程及釘道情形，當晚返回南昌休息，八日原車返杭。這經梁家渡，貴溪時將停車視察橋工及沿途運輸情形。贛省府現擬定爭取美援計劃，將向史提出三〇三萬四千美元之要求，以作農業改進，社會救濟，修建公路，農田，水利，河防及衛生設備等事業之興建，牯嶺登山路工程估計需款三〇一二億元，亦希望能獲得美援與工。</p>
<h3>立院交會通過　郵資加三倍　待院會最後決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立院交通委會，一日晨開會，審査郵資加價案，冉容谷主席，經決議擬請照政院咨送之乙案通過，即郵資普遍增加三倍，平信二萬元，唯佘凌雲·劉志平等則認為郵資不應加價，即加價亦至多可增加一倍，渠等保留此項反對意見，將與審査結果一併記錄，報吿院會討論，以作最後決定。</p>
<h3>美軍顧問團派小組赴穗　協助我整訓軍隊　實際訓練由我軍官担任</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處南京一日電〕美國軍事顧問團一小組在保靈上校率領下，今日赴廣州，開始整編與訓練三個中國師團之諮詢工作。此事業經美軍事代表團團長巴大維在此宣佈。小組人選除保靈上校外，尙有顧問軍官三人，士兵二人，工程師一人，醫警官一人及通譯二人。預料該組最後可增至軍官十一人及士兵八人，其任務在協助中國師長及其參謀人員策劃一切整編與訓練工作，並對參謀人員在訓練工作方面予以指導並提供意見。在實際訓練方面，美軍官並不直接參與其事。訓練工作，將由各級中國軍官担任。第一步工作將為對於一百敎官幹部之訓練，提供意見，此等敎官分成小型軍器委員會，戰術委員會，及其他名目之委員會。四屋期後，此等敎官將訓練一大幹部，為時八星期。然後開始師團之改編與訓練，約六星期究成。同時，美軍顧問團人員對於師部之行政，將提供意見。</p>
<h3>司法院舉行接交儀式　王寵惠就職視事　勉僚屬共同努力完成行憲工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕司法院院長王寵惠，一日晨十時蒞司法院，正式就職。前院長居正於十時前到院，等候王院長蒞臨後，即在院長室內交接鈴記，旋在大禮堂內，舉行簡單之交接儀式，全體職員均參加。行禮如儀後，首由居氏介紹王氏說明王氏之道德學問，均為吾人所景仰者，王氏並曾任司法總長，頃再任行憲後第一屆司法院院長，可謂極其適合。次由王氏致詞，對居氏之介紹表示愧不敢當，今後仍將請居氏隨時指示。繼稱：現時局艱難，行憲與戡亂並行，盼吾人為國家努力服務，以完成戡亂行憲之工作。禮成後，王氏送居氏至門首，全體職員亦均送至門苜，王氏則赴辦公室，開始視事。</p>
<p>王氏談話</p>
<p>王氏於下午五時，在其官邸接見記者，暢談行憲後之司法院職權及對憲法之解織等問題。首稱：行憲後司院之職權，應以推行法治為主，法治精神最重要者為守法，無論政府與人民，均應如此：其次為法令簡化，凡法令有衝突重複者，或行之不順利者，均有整理之必要。關於解釋憲法問題，此項工作實非一易事，因我國憲法介乎英美憲法兩者之間之一種制度，解釋時自將頗費周折。至於解釋憲法，乃係根據一已發生之具體問題而解釋，因司院並非憲法研究所：至提出此具體事實請求解釋者，得由機關提出之，其解釋之程序，則俟大法官集會後決定。記者詢以如在憲法上發現漏洞時，司法院解釋後是否尙可提補救方法？王氏稱：不可，司法院僅司解釋之責，而不能修憲，凡發現漏洞或其他問題時，亦僅能加以解釋。最後記者詢以大法官之黨籍問題，王氏以個人意見解釋稱，法官乃注重公平執行而不重視黨的關係，故（一）不必脫離黨籍，（二）黨的組牆不能參加，（三）執行職務應公平不偏，不以黨為原則。王氏稱：大法官超出黨派之精神，即在於此，然此為本人個人之意見。</p>

<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立院外委會一日晨開會，會中簡貫三曾報吿財金委會財產稅小組決議關於外人財產徵稅，在法律上不應予以特殊豁免之優遇，外委會之意見，則以此事在對外關係上存在事實困難，仍請財金委會再予注意。此外，該會對熱烈討論邱有珍所提派遣赴日考察團，終以技術問題不易解決，決議保留，至陶鎔所提關於滇緬劃界案，則決議先交小組作初步審査。</p>

<h3>社論　早已召開對日和會！</h3>
<p>監察院昨晨舉行第十五次大會，討論監委鄒魯等九十四人所提出的「請政府及早促成對日和約」一案，各監委紛紛發言，無不主張督促政府採取主動外交，打開對日問題的僵局，以促成對日和約的締結。在遠東有關各國一片反對美國扶植日本聲中，我國監察院也討論此一問題，更足以說明我國朝野對於日本問題的關切了。</p>
<p>日本是在一九四五年八月十日宣佈無條件投降，九月二日在米蘇里艦上正式簽降的，至今快要滿整整的三個年頭了；但是收拾戰後遠東殘局的對日和會，迄今尙未召開，展望前途，還是遙遙無期，締造對日和約，更是談不到。三個年頭在時間上講不算短，眞是現代史上空前未有的怪現象，一紙和約園然不能保陣遠東的永久和平，但是沒有對日和約根本就不能使遠東從戰爭狀態進入正常狀態，所以不論為遠東和平計，或為遠東有關各國的利益計，都有及早召開和會締造和約的必要。目前遠東僵局的造成，其因素固然不一而足，但是其中最主要的，乃在美蘇對於日本問題，不僅看法不同，而且各有打算，致使負責起草對日和約的遠東委員會也陷於停頓狀態。盟國對日意見的分歧，首受其打擊的，當然是曾受日本侵略的遠東國家，尤其是我們中國，在兩極的夾攻中，處處感到左右為難的痛苦；而且眼看着美國對日政策的迅速改變，日本復興的蒸蒸日上，怎使我們不感覺到恐懼，而深以日本的復興將為遠東和平與我國安全的威脅為憂呢！所以最近我國社會上一些人士的反扶日的言論，就是由此而發生的；我國朝野的一致主張及早召開對日和會締造對日和約，其原因亦即在此。</p>
<p>即使將我國主張早日召開和會的理由置而不論，就是其他對日有關各國，也是無不希望及早召開對日和會的。姑以英國為例，員文外相於今年五月間在工黨年會席上發表演說，也要求參加太平洋戰爭之各國，早日如開和會，以解決此一最感棘手之日本問題；並說明其理由稱：「如欲解決遠東問題，則應先締結對日和約。」貝文外相的主張，不僅為英國人民所贊成，而且也為遠東各國人民所歡迎。祇有美國方面態度冷淡，仍無打開對日問題的僵局之意，據聯合肚五月十九日的華盛頓訊，美國外交當局，相信對日和會，或將無限期擱置。聞美國認為此　仍不宜召開對日和會，其所持的理由：（一）不相信蘇聯會放棄否決權；（二）不相信對日和會能够成功；（三）遠東十一國大半反對美國的扶植日本的政策，而且對於其他問題的意見也頗不一致。由此可知，對日和會遲遲未能召開的癥結，一在召開對日和會的程序問題；二在盟國對日基本問題的意見紛歧。</p>
<p>關於前者，美國最初提議，主張由遠東十一國舉行會議起草對日和約，採用三分之一的多數表決制，任何一國不得行使否決權。蘇聯對於美國建議，首先表示反對；並提出一個對案，主張由中·英·美·蘇四强外長會議，起草對日和約，必須商得四强一致；換句話說，中·英·美·蘇四强對於和約均可行使否決權。美蘇的意見不啻南轅北轍，但我國為早日召開對日和會起見，乃提出一個折衷方案，主張由遠東委員會十一個會員國，組織一個對日和約預備會議，採取多數表決；但任何決議必須包括中·英·美·蘇四國的問意票，此一會議的日期，亦由中·英·美·蘇四國商定。今日思之，假如當時的英國，不堅決支持美國的建議，中國所提出的折衷方案，或有為美蘇雙方接受的可能。現在如仍由中英兩國繼續努力，調處美蘇意見，對於召開和會的程序，不是沒有商得協議的希望。</p>
<p>以言後者，從中國開始，一直到澳洲菲律賓，凡是曾遭日本侵略的遠東各國，沒有不反對美國扶植日本復興的。因為遠東各國的人民，站在愛國的立塲上，即使他們能諒解美國的對日政策，但要他們不反對日本復典威脅到他們的安全，勢必不可能。美國若不尊重他們的意見和願望，聽任事態推演下去，不問東京盟總對於遠東各國的反美扶日如何答辯，但終無益於遠東局勢的澄淸，而且其結果所屆，美國外交在遠東恐將陷於孤立；所以美國即使不為自己的利益打算，也該早日澄淸遠東各國的輿情，召開對日和會締結和約，實為唯一的根本辦法。只要根據波茨坦宣言的規定，召開對日和會，公平解決一切問題，締結不偏不倚的對日和約，由盟國一致遵守；如此不僅美國對於管制日本不要單獨負責，而且遠東各國也不會因對日問題而與美國發生齟齬，利己利人，何樂而不為呢？請美國外交當局三思之。</p>
<p>要之，現在召開對日和會，可謂已到了最適宜的時機，我們相信我國外交當局必能採取主動外交，促成對日和會的召開；因為最近三年以來，我國外交當局無時不注視此一問題的發展，無往而不欲促成對日和會的召開。我們人民只要把握住適宜的時機，循着國民外交的途徑，宣示人民的意志與願望，支持政府據理力爭，就不難達成我國外交政策的目的。反之，如若不知國民外交的運用，而一味盲目的搖旗吶喊，則必招致相反的結果。</p>

<p>〔中央社杭州一日電〕蔣總統對空校廿五期學生畢業特頒訓詞如下：今天諸生已完成其最後習修之學程，適値戡亂建國之重要，此後為國服務，必能宏益貢獻，中正於欣慰之餘，特舉數義以相勗勉：第一，應認識建軍建國之責任，諸生於抗戰最艱苦之時期，響應靑年從軍，自動入伍受訓，其抱負本甚宏遠，蓋以革命建國為職志，第一步必須以建軍保證抗戰之勝利，今抗戰結束已屆三載，而共匪叛亂，變本加厲，國家之統一建設遭受阻礙，民族之生存自由遭受威脅，故第二步必須以建軍達成戡亂任務，建軍與建國息息相關，揆以「無空防即無國防」之義，則空軍建設尤為重大急切，諸生為空軍中堅幹部，當益凜於今後責任之重大，戡亂建國工作一日未成功，即諸生之責職一日未完盡。第二，應發揮智勇兼備精神，廿世紀巳進至原子能時代，因科學進步，已愈提高空軍建設之速度，今後諸生在服務過程中，仍須時時虛心研習，精益求精，以增進新的智能，同時以大無畏精神，準備時時為救國救民而奮鬥，犧牲小我，立功報國，國父遺訓曾昭示吾人「長技能明生死」，我空軍尤須具備此種精神條件，始能樹立現代空軍模範。第三，應愛惜物力，充實戰力，我國科學工業落後，航空工業方在萌芽，一切物質設備幾全賴外來供應，諸生今後服務，對一切機械設備與武器，務須加意愛護，杜絕浪費，予以充分利用，發揮最大效能，諸生能體念國家財力物力之艱難，事實上即不啻增强國防上無限之實力。以上三端，切盼深切體念，篤實奉行，今日為建國最艱苦時期，亦為諸生成功立業千載一時之良機，國家所期待於諸生者至為殷切，任重道遠，曷共勉焉。蔣中正</p>

<h3>孫越崎對記者報告　資委會事業現況　運用美援計劃在湘贛開發煤礦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕資委會委員長孫越崎，一日下午出席政院新聞局記者招待會，報吿該會業務，及答復記者詢問。據孫氏稱：資委會所經辦之事業，大別之可分為三類：（一）電力，（二）工廠，（三）開鑛，詳細分之，共可分為十一種：（一）煤礦，（二）金屬鍍，（三）油鑛，（四）電力，（五）鋼鐵，（六）機械工業，（七）電工，（八）化工，（九）糖，（十）紙，（十一）水泥。以地區言之，資委會所研辦之事業，分佈於七個區域：（一）東北，（二）華北，（三）台灣，（四）華中，（五）華南，（六）西北，（七）西南。西北，西南兩區，在抗戰時期建設均有成績，華中，華南，在抗戰時為敵佔據，建設甚徵，東北，華北，台灣三區，工業均甚發達，惟三區建設刻最困難，以東北而論，一由於工業器材多被蘇聯拆遷，一由於共匪之破壞，加之東北區大部被共匪佔據，建設甚為困難。華北方面，平津工鑛仍繼續開工，惟亦有一部分地區被共匪佔領。臺灣工鑛事業甚多，敵人投降前曾遭盟軍飛機轟炸，損失頗重，近兩年積極建設，工鑛已有進步，相信以後當可有生產品輸出。上述十一項事業中，以煤，鋼鐵，油料，電力四項為中心工作。以區械論，台糖之出產，亦佔極重要之地位。至資委會之工作人員，共有廿二萬人，在東北損失甚大，優秀之工程師張莘夫，兪再麟等，均被共匪殺害，鞍山鋼鐵廠撤退時，亦有甚多專門人材被共匪俘虜。孫氏繼並答復記者詢問稱：資委會所主辦之各項事業中，電力約佔全國百分之六十，鋼鐵在鞍山未陷前佔全國百分之九十九，現巳大减，惟華北石景山鐵鑛開工後，生鐵仍可自給，煤之產量，去年佔全國百分之卅五，現僅有撫順及本溪湖煤鑛生產，其他各大鑛多被共匪佔據，已不及百分之廿矣。有記者詢其雞設重心是否將移至華南？孫氏笑稱：此為難以答復者，但工業建設非短時期內可以完成，必須置於安全之地，如工業建設之重心隨時受共匪之威脅，即將有前功盡棄之虞。記者詢其運用美援資委會有何計劃？孫答謂已擬訂計劃，在湖南湘潭及江西萍鄉開辦煤鑛，此項計劃並已提交史蒂爾曼。</p>

<h3>僑委會委長劉維熾談　運用僑資辦法　認僑匯應按自由市場價收購</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕關於運用華　物資及吸收華僑匯款問題，僑務委會委員長劉維熾頃對記者談有效辦法。劉氏表示，我僑居海外之僑胞越一千餘萬人，分佈於全世界各地，第二次大戰結束後，尙有甚多國家限制我僑胞匯款返國，但在此等限制華僑匯款國家，對華僑物資之出口並無限制，因此在目前排華運動日熾之嚴重情形下，如何利用華僑物資，使其能大量運回祖國，以補助有關生產物資之必需品，政府對此應有全盤考慮，製訂具體而有效之辦法，迅付實施之必要，最近政府對華僑物資之進口，因經僑務主管當局及僑胞之要求，稍有變更，但其範圍仍嫌不够，應盡量擴充其基礎，使所有華僑物資之進口，不必一定由政府代為處理出品，僅應於政府指導之下，而對於物資變賣所得之資金之運用，加以合理限制即可，此項限制之辦法，可以規定優厚之利息，使是項僑資能儲存於國家銀行，或規定是項僑資之一部份，由政府指定向國外購買於生產有關一物資或原料，再行進口，以備國家之使用，或指定其購買政府公債及各項政府發行之有價證券，如此，僑胞必定樂於遵守與接受。至於僑匯方面，戰前每年平均僑匯一項收入，即達一萬萬美元以上，我國國際之支付，因賴以勉得平衡，戰爭發生以後，僑匯數目即大量减少，待戰事結束後，華僑匯款理應大為减加，唯由於美金官價與自由市塲價格相去過距，匯返祖國時其幣値即行貶低，以致紛紛逃避，目前政府對於僑匯雖作種種改善，唯仍感不够，依據劉委員長之意見，其改善之辦法，可歸納為兩點：第一，凡是僑匯，均應以當日自由市塲價格收購，第二，政府應許可僑胞自由攜帶外幣黃金或外國有價證券等進口，但為限止其有從事投機行為起見，對是項進口之黃金或外幣，於進口時可舉行登記，如携帶者於需要變賣時，即由政府以當日之自由市塲價格收購，若能如此，即可收一勞永邊之效矣。</p>

<p>一·開封戰役：陳毅三·八·十·三個縱隊，自從六月十六日從豫西南間道竄犯開封，其原意仍在接應陳匪主力南下，陳匪乘我大軍增援開封之際，其一·四·六縱隊及兩廣快速等縱隊，竄至隴海路南杞縣·通許·民權三角地區，與三·八·十縱隊互相呼應，另外陳賡匪部的第九縱隊在中牟，白沙一帶，阻擾我西路國軍向開封前進，同時策應劉匪二·三·六·十縱隊及陳賡第四縱隊，在西平，上蔡附近，以遲滯我南路大軍的行程，總計匪為了攔阻我對開封的增援，使用了十萬以上的兵力，然也因此給了國軍一個各個擊破的機會，我魯西追擊兵團，從城武至曹縣，考城一綫，向匪側背猛擊，共擊斃匪八千餘人，連同在蘭封·野鷄岡·中牟·白沙·上蔡附近，加上各地被我空軍炸斃之匪，及在萬福河南北被我擊斃之匪，總數達三萬四千七百餘人。（外傳空軍轟炸人民，經調査並不確實，空軍方面已將事實眞象，另行公佈。）開封之役，因匪採用人海戰術，被我陸空協同擊斃者，前後共逾一萬五千人·而我在同一時期內之損失，包括地方團隊在內，僅為一萬六千人，與匪之傷亡數四萬九千七百餘人相較，三分之一還不到。</p>
<p>開封的保衛戰，在軍民合作之下，到了二十二日電訊中斷，二十三日晚間，我一部守軍合同團隊，轉移至開封東北地區，當與中牟派出突擊部隊取得聯絡，陳毅三，八·十縱隊見我各路大軍行將合圍，才倉惶徵集車輛，以主力押同掠奪所得之物資，經赤倉鎭南竄，我先頭部隊於二十五日下午九時進入開封北城，到二十六日下午二時止，我已有兩個師進駐開封，四時一刻，我西進兵團也在興隆集擊破匪殿後部隊第十縱隊後衛，而到達開封，於是我東西北三路大軍，正式在開封會師。</p>
<p>匪在開封城內騷擾四天，主要任務在搶掠物資和捕殺公務人員。據脫險之開封守軍六十六師砲兵通排長吳正報吿，匪曾將我黨政軍公務人員五千餘人，驅至黃河沙灘，騙令候船，而集體加以槍殺，該吳正係僥倖生還之一人，匪軍慘無人道至此地步，而對外猶時作虛偽宣傳，圖欺騙無知人士，但終掩不了事實。</p>
<p>二·豫東會戰：開封收復後，我各路大軍即向退集黃泛區之匪部展開全面進剿，從二十七日起，我連克陳留，睢縣，杞縣，二十九日在睢縣以南通許以東地區，目前雙方正發生最激烈的戰鬥，三日來，匪之兩廣縱隊已被我擊毀，匪之傷亡已過二萬，國軍損失約五千人。此外竄至許昌附近的劉匪二，三，六縱隊，也大部星夜北竄已過長葛，洧川，似有接應通許方面陳匪的模樣。這一方面的戰事，如陳劉各匪部不再學過去一樣覓隙逃脫決戰，其發展頗堪注意。</p>
<p>（二）冀東和魯中的戰况：除豫東戰塲之外，冀東和魯中方面的戰事，也是本週內較重要的戰况。</p>
<p>一·冀東方面：匪林彪十一縱隊，李運昌第八縱隊，和聶榮臻二，四縱隊，糾同匪三，十二軍分區所屬八個團，共六萬多人，自廿四日起，分向北寗路關內段秦皇島以西，古冶以東，我北戴河，留守營，安山，石門，昌黎，雷莊等據點進犯，安山，石門，昌黎，一度被匪竄陷，匪的目的在想破壞北寗路，但迄二十九日止，以上各據點均經我軍收復，我東西兵團並在昌黎會師，現正繼續追擊，被匪破壞之鐵路，我正積極搶修中，不久即可恢復原狀。</p>
<p>二，魯中方面：陳匪第七縱隊，第八縱隊，自糾集十三縱隊，再度向我兗州外圍進犯以來，匪在廿五日至廿七日，曾分向我東關，西關猛撲，戰事甚為慘烈，廿八日匪因傷亡過重，超過八千多人，形勢轉緩，到廿九日晚間戰事又起，犯東西關之匪，經我空軍協同守軍擊退，刻兗州城防甚為鞏固，雖匪在明水之第九縱隊正星夜南竄增援，打算乘我援軍未到之前，侵陷兗州，作長期阻碍津浦交通的妄想，但事實上，這一週中間，匪除了犧牲慘重之外，幷無所得。</p>

<h3>抗議蘇聯封鎖柏林交通　三強決取聯合行動　照會擬就一俟外交當局批準即可發出　蘇宣布柏林共管制已結束</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦一日電〕官方消息靈通人士今日稱，美英法三國已擬就聯合照會，要求蘇聯解除柏林封鎖，恢復該處四國共管，一俟美國務部長馬歇爾英外相貝文及法外長皮杜爾核准，即向莫斯科提出，其日期或在本星期杪。此項照會起草者為美駐英大使陶格拉斯，法駐英大使馬西格里及英外部專家史屈朗。三人今日會議兩小時，巳將措辭整理完成，其內容官方暫不宣布，惟悉柏林封鎖如不解除，柏林西區居民發生何事，蘇聯應負其責。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕據悉美英法三國正準備向莫斯科提出對蘇聯封鎖柏林之嚴重抗議。外交家稱，依照目前之計劃，除非蘇聯突然改變其政策，命令篠境蘇軍司令重開柏林之陸上交通，將不能阻止直接對克姆林宮之直率要求</p>
<p>據消極最靈通方面消息，對莫斯科之抗議書將採下列形式，第一·將要求蘇聯外交部處理立即廢除交通限制之問題；第二·如蘇聯政府不發出上項命令，則三强不負可能招致之後果之實；第三·將再度要蘇聯同意統一柏林及全部德國之經濟，雖然上項要求巳久試而無結果。</p>
<p>〔路透社相林一日電〕蘇聯已於今日正式宣布四强共管柏林之結束。柏林蘇軍司令之參謀長卡里寗上校於今午召築盟國參謀長宣讀預先擬就之宣言，宣布四强共管柏林之結束宣言有云：「霍萊上校（柏林美軍司令）之著名作風，英法代表對蘇當局抗議之缺乏反應，以及西方盟國之單獨在柏林實施幣制改革，巳使柏林四强聯合軍政府之會議無法舉行。蘇聯代表今後將不再出席柏林聯合軍政府之四强會議」。宣讀畢英參謀長奧斯朋美參謀長布拉及法參謀長達諾，詢問關於聯合軍政府之地位，卡里寗答以蘇代表將不再參加聯合軍政府任何級的會議，但其技術僱員將暫留聯合軍政府內整理文件。在蘇方技術員整理擋案期間，蘇聯國旗將繼續與其他三强國旗並列，蘇哨兵一名亦將繼續駐守門口。聯合軍政府雖結束，其對柏林前此所頒命令仍將由蘇方承認，蓋蘇方尊重四强協定，此等協定及決議對蘇自仍有效。</p>
<h3>西德總理接受三強建議　制憲會九月前召集　起草新憲組織自治政府</h3>
<p>〔路透社佛朗古福一日電〕英軍政府長官羅勃森·美軍政府長官克萊·法軍政府長官寇尼許，今日在此間美軍政府總部，向西德十一邦之總理正式提出建議，囑於九月初以前召開制憲議會，實施倫敦六國會議議決有關西德未來之計劃，其內容將使西德聯邦接掌現歸三强軍政府行使的大部份對內責任。三强之建議書係經三軍政府長官漏夜集議後草成，其中責成德人選任職權明晰確定的行政機構，設立獨立性的最高法院，具有複議聯邦立法·解決邦際糾紛的職權。</p>
<p>建議案內規定制憲議會起草的新憲法，應設立兩院聯邦議會，行使有關行政及賦稅的立法權。至於敎育宗敎文化福利等立法權，歸各邦議會行使，聯邦議會僅能負聯絡協調之責。克萊蒞會致辭之際，强調西德政府儘可能提早成立的必要。渠云，西方佔領强國深知西德制憲議會有於九月初以前召開的必要，俟憲法制定以後，組識西德政府的工作即可邁進一步。羅勃森除重申早日召開制憲議會之必要外，並曰，倫敦會議決定此一制憲議會，如屬可能，應容納東總諸邦之代表，最近佔領强國間雖發生一連串的事件，但諸君如能勸導東德同僚參與此一盛舉，當然仍為一椿好事。</p>
<p>〔路透社佛朗克福一日電〕西德各邦總理今日之會歷時僅一小時許，法軍總司令寇尼許並向會中提出佔領法案，規定盟國佔領當局與德國新憲政政府間之的關係。英軍總司令羅勃森並請若干邦審查其疆界，俾依傳統制度加以調整。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約一日廣播：蘇聯駐美大使潘友新今日與美國務副卿洛維特會晤二十分鐘，討論某一問題，但拒絕宣露其內容。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科三十日電〕美駐蘇大使館人員，幾全部更動，史密斯大使雖仍在此間，但據可靠方面消息，亦將於年底前離蘇，史氏曾允許杜魯門留任至美國大選後為止。此外有高級館員多人不久即將撤換，數月來已有不少更動，再隔一月，留存此間之熟識面孔，將不過十餘人。</p>
<h3>義社會黨大會選舉新執委　再決定應採路綫</h3>
<p>〔路透社熱諾亞一日電〕徘徊十字路口的義社會黨，今日在此開始舉行全代大會，以二二七·六〇九票之多數通過交明日選舉產生的社會黨新執委會，決定該黨今後的政策。要求與共黨正式合併之案，獲一六一·五五六票，採取溫和的社會主義之案獲一四一·八六六票，暫時均不成立。社會黨之秘書亦將由新執委會遴選，大致將為中間路綫之麥蒂沃蒂氏。</p>
<h3>希屬島地震海嘯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社雅典三十日電〕政府今日宣布，西海岸勒伐卡斯島發生地震，該島首邑房屋百分之九十坍毀，死二，傷百人，地震時發生海嘯。</p>
<h3>退出競選說　杜魯門否認</h3>
<p>羅斯福夫人競選副總統</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約一日廣播：杜魯門總統今日否認退出十一月間之競選，並自料可戰勝杜威。據杜魯門透露，羅斯福夫人已允競選副總統。杜氏預料在七月十二日民主黨大會中，渠可彼提名為民主黨總統候選人。</p>
<h3>共產情報局　總部遷羅京</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕貝爾格勒可靠方面息，九國共產情報局即將自貝爾格勒移往羅馬尼亞京城布加萊斯特最近決定驅逐狄托及其南共出於共產情報局之情報局會議，即係在羅京舉行。南駐捷大使吿彼等謂，共產情報局之批評南共，係根據被南當局逐出政府及開除黨籍的海勃朗及舒卓准樞兩人提出的惡意情報。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫決定增強實力　維護國族獨立自由　狄托元帥獲民眾熱烈擁護</h3>
<p>〔聯合會南斯拉夫三十日電〕狄托元帥今日由共黨幹部及高級軍官數人伴同參觀京城某建築工程兩小時，此乃狄氏兩星期來首次露面，關於其失踪之神秘性巳一掃而空，在塲之靑年工人成向之高叫萬歲，以示歡迎。狄托之出現，象徵南共繼續為其後盾，藐視共產國際情報局對其叛黨之責難。</p>
<p>表面上南斯拉夫共黨領袖繼續保持和平姿態，共黨中央委員會第二次聲明，宣布欲增强並繼續促進對蘇聯及對其他蘇聯附庸國之緊急合作，但力言「南斯拉夫民族之獨立實為走向社會主義及其全面進步之條件」，並要求「全面加强南斯拉夫軍隊，保衛國族之自由與獨立。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒德卅日電〕消息靈通方面否認關於南斯拉夫內部之種種謠言，尤其為邊界一帶發生衝突之消息。外人現皆不許入邊界區，但本社訪員能證明南都諸皆安謐</p>
<h3>南共譴責保共</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦一日電〕南共獨裁者狄托雖在莫斯科及東歐共黨之四面楚歌中，一日又擴展其反攻而打擊共同角逐巴爾幹領袖權之保總理狄米特洛夫。狄氏為老共黨員，且係第三國際之領袖。今年一月狄氏建議巴爾幹聯邦，一遇蘇聯反對，狄氏即自承錯誤，反之，狄托以為對克林姆宮無特別義務，渠所以掌握大權，乃由於戰時抗德之功勳。南共機關報「波爾巴」又發表一篇猛烈社評，為狄托主義聲辯，對保共則撻伐不遺餘力。然廿四小時前，該報尙向保國伸出友誼之手，並建議南保阿聯邦。</p>
<p>〔路透社華沙一日電〕波蘭報紙，除支援共產情報局對南共之指賣外，並創立「狄托主義」的新名辭，其定義為具有元首狂，自負感，缺乏遠見及協調的誇張性計劃」之主義。</p>
<p>〔路透社布達佩斯一日電〕匈勞工黨（共黨與左翼社會黨合併而成）中央委員會頃發表宣言，聲明完全接受共產情報局對南共採取錯誤政策所成立的決議。</p>
<h3>建立聯邦制承認以色列　阿聯盟拒絕接受　要求貝那多特修正和平建議</h3>

<p>〔路透社開羅一日電〕阿拉伯聯盟秘書長阿柴　頃在此談稱：貝那多特之巴勒斯坦和平建議，筍不修正則阿拉伯祇有拒絕之一途。阿盟刻巳任命小組會以起草對該建議的答覆。阿柴姆氏强調聲稱：「我們決不接受聯邦制度，決不接受在巴勒斯坦境內設以色列。</p>
<p>阿拉伯對貝那多特之建議將提出若干點的修正，今祇待貝那多特的加以接受，如阿拉伯之意見不能與猶方意見相調和，則阿拉伯唯有予以拒絕的一途」。阿氏並曰：阿拉伯之答覆，將於週末以前送達羅特島。</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅一日電〕在此參加阿盟政治委員會會議之外約但總理阿勃杜霍達頃聲稱：阿拉伯業巳拒絕貝那多特所提之巴勒斯坦和平建議，係因不能接受以色列國存在於巴勒斯坦之故。阿氏復聲明外約但對巴勒斯坦並無土地野心，巴勒斯坦之阿拉伯居民獲得解放後，將聽其自由決定開入外約但抑為阿盟內之獨立國。</p>
<h3>阿猶圓桌會議　阿拒絕參加</h3>
<p>貝那多特表示遺憾</p>
<p>〔路透社羅特島一日電〕貝那多特穴布阿拉伯業巳拒絕派代表來此與猶方參與圓桌會議，余認此乃以直接會談覓取妥協的最好方法，阿拉伯之拒絕實不勝遺憾。</p>

<h3>大批英美機運糧接濟　蘇考慮鬆弛柏林冷圍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林一日電〕蘇聯方面一日暗示，柏林冷圍可能不日解除或鬆弛。蘇佔領當局官方通訊社官稱，當局正考慮修改柏林通往西區公路上之交通規程，「與减輕現下之限制」。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕至今日上午十一時為止，運糧載抵柏林美軍區坦波爾道夫機塲之美運輸機已達四十九架，運來糧食近一百噸，預料至晚可望打破卅日共有一百廿五架飛機抵達之紀錄。又悉自美調來協助糧運之四引擎巨型機亦已絡續抵達法朗克福，即可加入空運，自漢諾佛運糧抵達柏林英軍區蓋多機塲之英機，迄午亦已達卅二架。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林卅日電〕英機一百架載運大宗糧食，今日自西德抵達柏林，堪稱承平時期英機最大規模的出動。昨日午夜至今日下午四時為止，運糧之美機降落柏林者共達一百十六架，運來糧食已達二百噸。</p>
<h3>不懼蘇使用暴力及恫嚇　三強決留駐柏林　貝文外相闡述對德政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卅日電〕整個下院以極大歡呼聲，迎接貝文外相之鄭重聲明英國在柏林危機中決不屈服的態度。先是保守黨副領袖艾登曾要求政府採取堅決態度，渠謂，有時祇有一條可能的途徑，得以維護和平，目前已為採取堅決立塲的時期，而柏林事件亦為必須堅決以赴的事件。政府應會同其他西方盟國，鄭重吿知蘇聯，決不受暴力及恫嚇之屈服。</p>
<p>貝文於答覆之際，先詳述柏林危機的過程，渠云，「蘇聯藉口技術上的理由，先後禁止公路鐵道內河及橋梁的交通，吾人嘗承認其理由，並願供給技術上的協助及物質，助其修理橋梁鐵道。吾人於此不得不懷疑蘇聯多方留難之動機，是否眞正在技術問題及管制幣制問題，抑係另有政治上的作用，以迫使吾人退出柏林。就技術問題言，吾人已願供給協助，甚至不惜供給吾方亦缺乏之修理物質，俾交通早日恢復。就管制幣制言，至今日早已失去時效，然則其動機乃係使吾人在柏林之地位發生困難而不得不退出。蘇聯茍欲不擇手段，造成柏林西區二百五十萬人的肌饉，因此引起紊亂及反動，以資對其戰時盟友施用壓力，則英政府決不受其屈服，（歡呼）敢信美法盟邦亦持類似意見。（歡呼）吾人決不能對拒絕屈服於蘇聯壓力以下的柏林民主份子棄之不顧，無數萬的柏林市民寗願忍受任何匱乏的痛苦，決不願受蘇聯的統治，此等市民値得吾人充分的支援。吾人於處理此等事件所採的步驟，莫不與美法政府密切交換意見，英美法之代表經常視局勢之需要而舉行會議，吾人對於當局的任務以及所將面臨的阻礙，有充分的認識。英政府已決定動用一切可資動用的能力，美國亦已從事類似的措施，以防止貨遝的完全中斷，使蘇聯頒佈的限制失其效用。美國政府亦如吾人之確認其在柏林之地位，係基於協定而取得，其繼續留在柏林之意志，決不有所變更。今晨傳聞索何洛夫斯基已有撤銷若干限制之意，本人不擬就索帥之言，多加爭辯，但吾人目前所需者，仍為行動而非空言。本人有不得不鄭重聲明者，即吾人一體堅持柏林應依照四强的基礎而治理，吾人亦隨時準備以四强的基礎討論柏林局勢。同時，吾人仍須進行我方的一切計劃以應付其局勢。惟以當前情勢複雜而微妙，故英政府亦必須謹慎從事，不能貿然冒險。」述及德國之一般局勢時，貝文謂，蘇聯已、一貫的悖棄波茨坦協定，破壞德國可能的統一。三年來蘇聯自其佔領區內取得之賠償物資，已達七十億元之鉅，使英美單獨負擔維護德人生存的任務。英國協助德國建設的費用已逾二億鎊，波茨坦協定規定德國之解除武裝·肅淸納粹·及完成民主化，在西區內此等初步目標已經達到，隨時可供檢查，然在蘇聯區內始終為黑幕所籠罩。就蘇聯控制的德文報紙觀，東德已有國家民主黨正在組織之中，以吸收前納粹份子，就安全方面言，西方國家對此誠不能不感覺萬分關切云。</p>
<h3>麥克尼爾　結束辯論</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕國務大臣麥克尼爾代表政府，今日在下院中結束德國問題辯論之際，對於若干方面之對柏林危機之故作危言聳聽，表示遺憾。渠謂柏林局勢已達嚴重的程度，不容再有謠言予以誇大於此渠指出外傳聯聯已在柏林週圍佈置阻隔汽球之說，為絕對不確。荒若果有其事，則西方强國必致射擊事件，因而引起眞正的衝突，料蘇聯決不準備如此。麥克尼爾繼又重申貝文外相之語，表示西方强國決不屈服，不論有無汽球，決繼續留駐柏林。</p>

<h3>參議大會圓滿閉幕　議長致詞提高警覺　前途難關方興未艾　應安定軍警及中產階級生產</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第六次火會，於昨日召開第八次會議後，圓滿閉幕。此次會議，自上月廿一日揭幕以來，迎續舉行會議，除週四外，迎延會二日在內，會議前後共歷十日。討論議案一百五十餘件，大部均順利獲得結論。</p>
<p>昨日會議，自下午三時四十五分開始，除設置市立中醫院一案，經一小時之辯論，獲得通過後，其餘議案，討論經過，大多風平浪靜。延至七時五十分，全部議程討論完畢。五分鐘後，即舉行休會禮。</p>
<p>休會典禮於軍樂悠揚聲中開始。議長領導行禮如儀後，即登台致休會詞，略謂：此次會議，前後共歷十日，各同人對各提案審愼熱烈商討，獲得相當結論，實堪自慰。猶憶上月廿一日本會揭幕時，本席曾談到過去三個半月間物價波動趨勢，乃會議十日間物價之波動，較過去三個半月，才為劇烈。中央對此當然關注，行政院與主管院部，聞已擬具應急措置，待呈准最高當局後施行。而市政當局，亦在最短期間，召開臨時經濟會報，決定應急措置四項，付諸實施，日來已得到相當效果，物價漸轉穩定。然物價　穩之另一因素，即近日正屆金融界結賬之期，故結賬後之經濟動態，亦堪注意。再如東北流通券，自平市參會通過暫停兌換後，亦可能流向上海，且內匯近已開放，游資咸有麕集滬市趨向，凡此種種，均値得提高參會同人之警覺。</p>
<p>次談治安，經濟是生活，惟治安不但是生活，亦是生命。治安不保，則身家生命亦終將不保。故欲保治安，同人實應十二萬分關心保衛上海軍警之生活，應盡力使若輩衣食無憂。維持洽安之外，特別更需維持中產階級生活之安定。參會決不爲豪富說話，惟不能因看不過少數之豪富，致亦看不過大多數之中產工商業。本席今日爲工商業說話，不僅係爲工商業之投資人着想，同時更爲服務於工商業之全體職工着想。果工商業崩淡，則服務各工商業之職工，又將何以解決生計。故就上海論上海，我們的生活秩序，咸因隨經濟之艱困，前途難關，或方興未艾，故實應有妥善應付之策。今休會期間，實應提高同人警覺，同人職責重大，休會期間，更應繼續努力不懈，與當局共同致力，以渡難關。</p>
<p>市長感慨萬端　提出兩點意見</p>
<p>旋由吳市長致詞，略稱：聞議長之言，感慨萬千，特提出兩點：（一）際此時艱，大家應有共同目標，即認淸共匪係大家之敵人，切不能尙存苟安圖存之心。（二）政府　人民須有互諒互信之精神。述至此，渠列舉若干棘手問題，處理時左右爲難，惟結果仍無法獲諒於外界，（一）七月份配米價，經奔波結果，定爲每担一千萬元，惟已歴受挫折責難。（二）公用事業價格之調整問題。生活指數問題。渠最後指出，目前爲非常時期，一切務望大家互諒互助，認淸目標，有錢出錢有力出力，則難關不難渡過。</p>
<p>最後參議員代表邵永生致答詞，渠稱：議長語重心長，市長到任後政績卓著，實爲一偉大之政治家。渠認爲民主政治爲一批評之政治，有格調，有範圍，大衆一致的觀念，除極少數例外，大體不致有誤。故同人應研究，向政府之建議，如何始能切合眞實之需要云。</p>
<h3>昨日會議經過</h3>
<p>昨日會議於下午三時四十五分開始時，爲避免中醫院一案辯論費時過久，特將該案延後付議，先提出衛生部份其他七案，先付公議。結果全部照審查意見通過。要案有；（一）請在北火車站附近建設完善之公厠所。（二）請衛生局注意南市衛生，淸除街道，取締私設厠所。（三）爲預防時疫，請加强衛生工作等</p>
<p>法規部份共八案，重要各案討論經過如次：（一）擬以大會名義，代電本市產生之國代及立委，請率先反對不顧民生疾苦，向政府奢求個人待遇之少數民意代表，無理要求案，審查意見保留，討論經過，另產生修正通過，重付審查，及照原案通過三項意見，提付表決結果，均無法獲得過半數之票數，故本案宣吿不成立。（二）爲暹羅政府摧殘華僑敎育，通過呈請外交部提出嚴重抗議。（三）通過電請行政院，將此次緝獲之日本漁艇及船員從嚴處。（四）建設中央立即更換各級主管中之貪汚及無能官僚，任用具有朝氣而精明廉潔之新人，以求澈底刷新政治。（五）通過發動抗蘇助長匪亂運動，提示中共賣國密約，要求收回旅大。</p>

<h3>冷氣火車　十五日起行駛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬路局「冷氣火車」，大部已裝配完竣，本月十五日決能如期加入京滬綫行駛。惟京滬綫之行車密度已達飽和點，故冷氣列車之加入行駛，必須將原有客車一列停止行駛。聞路局擬將凱旋號停駛，換入冷氣列車，行車速率亦將縮短至京滬全程五小時，恢復戰前飛快車之速度，每日晨七時自上北站開行，中午十二時半到達南京。下午六時由南京站開出，晚十一時半抵滬。</p>
<h3>首輪影片再度漲價　各級座價均提高十萬元　西片停供成僵局　影院業要求解約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕因停供新片問題，而引起影院業公會與西片商協會間之僵局，截至昨晚止仍未打開。據影院業公會表示：此次該會毅然向西片商提出賠償損失，及解除契約之要朮，在各影院本身雖明知吃虧，但爲表明立塲，並指出造成此事之責任究竟誰屬，故決堅持決議，毫不遷就，準備鬧僵而後已。至於開映西片之各首輪影院，因適應生活指數之上漲，今日起決將票價調整爲最低限價座二十萬元，其餘各級均提高十萬元，成爲三十萬，四十萬，五十萬，六十萬四級。惟影院業公會對外傳此種漲價係謀接近西片商理想條件，以預留彼此談判餘地之說，已加正式否認。該會表示目前各影院開映舊片仍可維持，如賣座漸趨低落，決即改映國片。渠等希望國片廠商能把握此一千載難逢之機會，努力生產，謹愼製作，以代替西片在上海根深蒂固之地位。</p>

<h3>國內航空各機　今日調整標價　自百分之百至一百八十不等</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日起調整之國內各綫航空客票運價增加成數自百分之一百至百分之一百八十不等，滬平綫僅增百分之一百；平瀋平幷綫百分之一百二十；滬蘭·滬昆綫百分之一百四十；華南及香港綫增加最多，爲百分之一百八十。普通貨物及逾車行李以往係每公斤按票價百分之一收費，此後將按票價百分之二，貴重貨物每公斤按票價百分之五，郵件信函按票價百分之一，包裹百分之二，新聞紙類仍照郵件運費六折。</p>
<p>盡力維持交通</p>
<p>據中航公司發言人談：交部核准之數與公司請求之普遍增加百分之一百八十九相距甚遠，而七月一日起油價匯價與生活指數復有增加。如以二月七日爲基數，七月一日之生活指數已上漲百分之六百四十六，汽油上漲百分之二千四百六十，匯價上漲百分之一千七百五十，依計算成本公式，現時票價應較二月七日增加百分之一千五百九十五，而屢次奉准增加數共計僅達百分之七百五十。在此種情形之下，航空公司爲减少賠累藉保本身生存起見，已準備考慮减少飛行班次，因多飛則多賠，少飛反可少賠，惟即令减班，對於具右政治經濟重要性之城市空中交通仍將盡力維持云。</p>
<p>各綫票價彙誌</p>
<p>茲將調整後上海至各地之票價分誌於後（一）雙引擎機：至南京五二〇萬元，至靑島二，八〇〇萬元，至濟南四，〇八〇萬元，至北平五，五〇〇萬元，至鄭州四，七九〇萬元，至西安七，八八〇萬元，至蘭州一〇，五四〇萬元，至迪化二〇，二四〇萬元，至九江二，七五〇萬元，至漢口三，七八〇萬元，至重慶七，三一〇萬元，至衡陽六，一七〇萬元，至桂林八，〇七〇萬元，至昆明一〇，七一〇萬元，至廣州七，五一〇萬元，至香港九，〇〇〇萬元，至福州三，二五〇萬元，至厦門四，七一〇萬元，至汕頭五，九四〇萬元，至台北五，五五〇萬元，至馬尼拉一五，八八〇萬元。（二）空中覇王機：至香港一四，四〇〇萬元，至靑島四，二〇〇萬元，至北平八，二五〇萬元，至重慶一〇，九七〇萬元。</p>

<h3>百貨同公司加薪爭執　社會局定日內調解　資方表示決不使職工失望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市永安，先施，新新，大新，國貨，麗華，麗安中華，華新，泰昌等十大百貨公司，（即所謂「環球百貨業」），因職工要求資方履行契約，實行年度加薪未遂，羣情激昻，表示將以行動對付，幸經社會局曁百貨業職工會竭力勸導，事態未趨擴大。社會局定於日內進行調解。</p>
<p>前日勞資方談判加薪決裂後，職工會除竭力勸導外，並呈請社會局迅予調處。昨日上午，資方同業公會代表新新公司總經理蕭宗俊，往謁社會局副局長趙班斧，陳述各公司困難情形，並表示即行與各公司負責人商討補救辦法，不致使職工全部失望。</p>
<p>國貨公司·停業一天</p>
<p>國貨公司資方聲稱營業較其他公司更爲清淡，故年度加薪，無法考慮。該公司職工曾於前晚召開組長會議討論，結果決定停止六底盤點存貨，（按例每半年舉行一次）並將以低廉價格出售貨品，以示反抗。公司聞訊，爲避免損失計，於昨日上午停止營業，同時並召開董事會議，籌商對策。旋經社局派員竭力勸導後，職工始允取銷原議，靜候解決。本定於午後恢復營業，嗣因全體職工午後繼續開會，致該公司昨停業一日，預料今日可照常營業。</p>
<p>新新公司·險生意外</p>
<p>新新公司職工態度較爲激烈，並要求與公司當局單獨談判，除年度加薪十元外，職工方面因聞各物品部部長最近加薪百分之五十，因此附帶要求職工每服務一年，加薪一元。但經該公司蕭總經理勸解後，附帶要求已由職工自動放棄，並不再堅特直接談判，可望不致發生意外。</p>
<h3>工人生活指數編製　何以低於物價指數　市府說明互異之點以釋羣疑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府因統計處所編之工人生活費指數，未能與各方所編躉售物價指數同樣上升，各方紛致不滿，且有懷疑工人生活費指數何以尙較主計處所發表之京滬區公務員生活費指數爲低者，市府昨將事實眞相說明如下：（甲）工人生活費指數較躉售物價指數爲低之原因：（一）工人生活費指數之編製，旨在測定工人生活費較基期上升之倍數，故其根據爲工人之家計調查，凡非日常生活所必需者，皆不在被選之列，面躉售物價指數所取之物品種類極爲廣泛，故兩種指數內容頗不相同。</p>
<p>配價遠較市價為低</p>
<p>目前外匯高漲，凡與匯率及建築有關之物品價格，均上漲甚巨，如上週中國經濟研究所發表之六月第四週指數，化學品類，金屬類，建築材料等上漲倍數極爲可觀，對於躉售物價總指數之高漲，具有不可抑止之影響。而工人生活必需品中之房租·電燈·自來水·公共汽車·電車等價格，均因受政府核定標準之影響，與一般物價上升之高度相差甚鉅。且生活必需品中受配售價格限制者如配米·配油·配糖等，均較市價遠爲低廉，故對工人生活費指數之相對低下，亦有重大影響。（二）市府所編工人生活費指數，係按全月物價平均計算，而躉售物價指數，多有兼編週指數及日指數者，以月指數與週指數，日指數相較，向大相逕庭。</p>
<p>與公務員差異原因</p>
<p>（乙）工人生活費指數與公務員生活費指數之差異：（一）上海市工人生活指數，係根據工人家計調查結果所編製，應用範圍僅在上海，而全國各地公務員生活費指數，則包括二十九種主換生活所需物品項目，應用範圍普及全國。（二）上海市工人生活指數適用區械爲上海市，而京滬區公務貝生活費指數適用區域甚廣，兩者不能相提並論。（三）上海市工人生活費指數係當月編製應用，京滬區公務員生活費指數係根據上個月之指數核定本月給付待遇之指數，前者較後者高出甚巨。如六月份工人生活指數爲七十一萬倍，而公務員生活指數則爲四十二萬倍。（四）上海市生活費指數以廿五年爲基期，公務員生活費指數則以廿六年上半年爲基期。（五）上海市工人生活指數以上海市基期總消費値爲計算指數之標準，各地公務員特遇，則以南京之基期總消費値爲計算指數之標準。</p>

<h3>最大的美金黑市場　最深的漏洞　青島</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>〔本報靑島廿八日訊〕靑島已成爲全國最大的美金黑市塲，最深的漏洞。有多量的美國人，五千到六千的樣子。美國的官員比中國官員來往頻繁得多。美國人的生活，和中國人比起來是兩個完全相反的曲綫方程式。於是，在中國沿海的邊緣上滋長着危險的優越感，完成和了正在究成各式的結論。</p>
<p>六月的中國淹沒在一陣漲潮中。美金黑市愈昇得高，「洋客」的身價也愈顯得高。恰像歡迎賴普漢似的，黑市一下子躍過三百萬。一個小公務員的月薪只抵五元美金而一個美國小兵的收入却是八·九十元。一個尉官有一棟洋房住。現在的美國兵口中，中國人通常被稱爲Gawk，意思是「呆鳥」，稱呼Chinese的可算得上是有修養的人。中國人是不是Gawk，住在靑島的五六千「洋客」便是一個證據。</p>
<p>太平角是靑島地理上的靈魂，現在充滿異國情調。四百多家不到二千人的美軍眷屬，新的還陸續在來。在中國警察局中沒有他們的戶籍，她們是美國軍隊的一部，享受海港勤務部的配給，有自己的學校。中國產業一宗一宗的被買進，油管和小鐵道的舖設也刺激不起更多的關心。靑島飛機塲在克萊門手裏，就由美國第六十六航空工程隊加以擴充，三十五年七月中吿一段落，去年一月全部完工，今年又加築若干建築物，磚木正絡繹從港口運入機塲。</p>
<p>房屋的需要一天比一天嚴重了房租高至每間五十元，有房產的中國人賴此爲生，美方請中國政府抑平房租，但這種交涉是不會有結果的。另一種交涉是性病，一到黃昏，美國兵擠滿在八十幾家酒吧裏面，等到軍醫查出士兵染有性病時，便不斷開了那些「吧孃」的名單向中國政府交涉。而中間有一層困難，眞正登記有案的「吧孃」不過一百廿個，大部是走私而來，至少在千名以上</p>
<p>不要小小覷她們，她們正爲政府在爭取外滙呢。現在，靑島已成爲中國最大的美金黑市塲，估計每月至少有三十萬美金流入黑市。以黑市價格計算，約合法幣八千億，等於目前中國通貨發行總額的二百分之一。一般投機家往來平滬販運，而直接鑽營黑市，藉博微利的小販也不下千人，有時甚至把價格做得比京滬都高。政府始終沒有能够禁止美軍在市塲上使用美金，但車夫或小販懷有幾塊錢時，便在取締黑市的名義下被逮捕，矛盾無過於此。</p>
<p>美金的來源有幾種：美軍及其眷屬直接使用於市塲，包括兌取黑市法幣。三百個華籍雇員一百幾十個外籍雇員的薪金，私人產業的房租。一千四百個華工的工錢是發法幣的，各人的原定工資以美金計，但發下的法幣算起來比牌價高，比黑市則低，滬些法幣的來源是黑市。經濟緊急措施方案，在這裏是完全失效。美方有若干處需要法幣，多從上海匯來，但這裏的中央銀行沒有看到這卅萬中的任何一張鈔票。除非有被抓到的所謂「美鈔犯」，押到中央銀行照牌價兌可憐的幾元錢。</p>
<p>漏洞大極了，世界性的缺乏美元，世界性的黑市，在靑島反映得是多麼强烈。一位少校在去年帶了六輛汽車到靑島，賺了三萬元，又帶回了北平地氈，憑空賺了六萬元，隨後退伍，到歐陸去游覽。去年四月裏，發瘋一樣湧進許多商品，尤其是汽車，柯克出售汽車的消息在滬報登出之後，中國的海關同時也嚷了起來，美政府限制軍人携帶新汽車出國，只准使用過半年的汽車帶出去，二年之後才可以出售。現在的靑島街頭還有仍然掛着加利福尼亞或佛吉尼亞牌子的車輛，但這些已是中國人的私產了。市塲三路已成爲著名的「美軍市塲」，仍然充斥着美國商品，市民口頭便改變了原來的路名。黑市需要，美金，通貨膨脹，特殊的交通，交織成一幅美麗的投機圖畫。考尼爾（Cornell），這位紐約的汽車經紀人，任艦隊司令部的新聞處長，去年八月退伍之後，仍然住在靑島，但常在香港，上海，甚至去新疆經商。有些軍醫退伍後設立私人醫院，藥品自也不須經渦海關。</p>
<p>在大海的邊緣，複雜的光和影交映着這幅圖畫。</p>

<h3>松江殺妻案</h3>
<p>丈夫藍富廷見事敗露　即用刀自戕昏厥倒地</p>
<p>〔本報松江卅日訊〕住居倉城街八十五號之江西人藍富廷，以賣餛飩爲業，與妻徐氏同居，廿九日上午，經同住一宅之錢王氏發覺，徐氏被殺身死，倒臥血泊中，伊夫藍富廷見事敗露，亦即用刀自砍，昏暈倒地，迨報大倉橋警所履勘，將受傷之藍富廷送公醫院急救，因受創甚重，血流過多，已不能言語，當轉報檢察處委騐。藍妻徐氏頭部被砍四刀，腦殼已碎，委係生前被砍致死，至藍富廷因何慘殺髮妻，須待藍富廷傷勢稍痊，由其自行供述。但據鄰近喧傳，則謂徐氏因有外遇，被夫撞破，致釀慘劇。本報記者</p>
<h3>金少山的難關</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　洪正倫</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日訊〕金少山可以說得上是「梨園世家」，先世以玩大合宮戱——按即傀儡戱，約三尺多高，名托吼人，與眞人無異——在北京出名，正式組班唱戱，始於少山之父金秀山，第一次組班是與楊香翠合夥，名寳盛合，第二次組班是與小生名宿德俊如，名松竹社在吉祥演唱，少山坐科出科，就在他父親所組的班子裏，可說是家學淵源。</p>
<p>半年沉疴　吉祥戱院被焚後，少山即由平而津，而靑島烟台，到上海，從此，就紅遍江南，靑雲直上。</p>
<p>少山回平，正是十年前遍地烽烟，日寇鐵蹄踏碎華北的時候。得病是在卅六年冬，到現在已七個多月，又逢上匪氛方熾，物價殺人，金霸王總算都嘗透了。</p>
<p>他這次患的病症，原是神經末梢炎，在醫藥昌明的今夭，本不算一個難治的絕症，只要服藥及時，看護得法，很快的就可恢復健康。</p>
<p>突然變卦　少山病勢沉重的時候，一班老朋友都主張把他遷入中和醫院診治，金少山也同意了，但當兩千萬的住院費送到金府的時候，金霸王突然變卦，因之，到現在，仍躺在他自已幽暗的病房裏，金霸王的理由是：要死就死在正房裏，決不能扔在醫院裏。直到今天，金霸王如不變更他執拗的見解，那眞是只好等待死亡。據侍候金少山病的周先生說：在中西醫束手的現在，經他老友駱九蓮介紹，認識一位和尙，現正由這位方外和尙來爲他治療。但不知這方外神仙能給他帶來海上仙方不能？）</p>
<p>家庭負擔　金少山家庭負擔相當的重，除了兩三個　夥計跟着他過活之外，他有兩妻：大妻楊氏，五十一歲，二妻李氏，名竹靑，二十九歲。兩子：長子大生，十三歲，次子苗子，五歲。兩女：長女大玲，十歲，次女二玲，九歲·次子及二女都在小學讀書，長子大生，據說神經不健全，關在家裏。</p>
<p>逢九是關　記者這次訪問他，正在和他說話的時候，忽然看見一個十三四歲的大孩子，頸項上掛着一個鐵鎖鏈，下面還帶上一個木坨，就像鎖瘋狗似的模樣。記者問他這是訛，過半天，他才囁嚅着說：「這就是大生啊！因爲他太頑皮了，所以這樣治他」。我看了，不僅有些兒凄然，我想，在這後面，或許還有一個小的悲劇！金霸王今年是五十九歲，據周先生說，逢「九」是一個關，不知道霸王能闖過這個關否？</p>

<h3>生活指數發表以後　零售價格面目一新</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市之商品及證劵市塲，均因銀錢業半年結賬而無正式交易，惟塲外交易仍有。因封關之故，銀根奇緊，暗息高至四角以上，物價　呈跌勢。昨日所發表之生活指數，上漲之成數空前，又　發薪之日，各公私機關紛紛向銀行提現，總數估計在一萬億以上。候根之緊，此爲主因。因市面頭寸短缺，致物價略呈疲態，昨晨上白米每擔售價爲一千九百餘萬，較最高峯已跌落二成。但就一般日用品而論，商家因生活指數之提高，已紛紛將零售價格調整，食品類更有　著上漲，猪肉於一日之內，每斤自四十二萬猛跳至五十萬元，其他如油炭等日常生活必需品價格，莫不面目一新，升斗小民，生活倍受威脅。至於開關後之一般物價，熟悉商情者認爲除非當局事先嚴格管制，否則難望穩定。</p>

<p>進口數量將受出口之限制</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕結匯證明書使用辦法公佈後，我國目前應採之貿易政策，必須予以配合。關於嗣後輸入原料，是否可以逐漸增加，工商界甚爲注意。茲據全經會負責人談稱：輸管會霍主委曾於本年六月二日記者招待會上，說明今後爲配合新結匯辦法所應採之貿易政策，其中一項，係保證基本工業獲得必需之器材進口，以鼓勵民族工業之發展。但嗣後進口貿易之數量，將受出口收入數量之限制。易言之，即量出爲入，故輸入原料，可否逐漸增加，須視外匯來源能否充裕而定。）</p>
<h3>工商動態</h3>
<p>四面楚歌聲中的民間工商業</p>
<p>財富愈集中，局面愈混亂，民間工商業所遭受的壓力，也一天比一天沉重。這種現象，證之中外史籍，固無獨有偶，即以目前工商界的處境來說，亦可說明其趨勢之一般。不能否認，本市民營工商業，已經陷於四面楚歌的困境中，一週來工商界的種種動態，更足以證明此種局面的日見惡化，茲以事件之較大者，列述于后。</p>
<p>（一）自立法院熱烈討論立委劉不同等所提之徵收臨時財產稅一案以後，本市工商界已引起了軒然大波。按擬議中的所謂臨時財產稅條例，擬以法人財產，與個人財產同時併課，凡營利事業之財產凈値，超過三百億元者（約値戰前三萬元之譜），皆納入徵課範圍，其稅額自百分之五起，累進至百分之六十，並規定此項財產稅，得以實物抵繳。此一臨時稅提案，雖尙未經立院討論定局，但自種種跡象看，似已有欲罷不能之勢。於是激起了本市工商界的一片反對聲。市商會市工協，銀業聯合會，三十八商業同業公會，工業會簿委會，市參會，前後紛紛電請立院罷議徵收財產稅案，理由大致爲該稅表面上雖以財產之多寡爲征收之標準，但眞正財產雄厚的豪門資本不是早已逃之國外，便是設法取巧躱避，故實際上之征收對象，又非臨諸民間工商業之身上不可，此與前由財產稅蛻變成的「救濟特捐」者正相類似。再者，如果擬議中的財產稅之起征點爲三百億元，則以物價指數計算，凡戰前三萬元以上之管通工商業，皆須應征。以戰前三萬元資本之工商業，而須納百分之五以上之財產稅，在目前社會不景氣的局面下，工商業非立即崩潰不可。此外，擬議中之財產稅又規定得以實物抵繳，則流動資金薄弱之工商業，勢必被逼以生產工具呈獻而後已。則此稅如果開征，民營工商業必蒙受致命之損害，市商會及工業會籌委會，於是再於上週週四，聯電國民黨總裁曁中常會痛陳利害，文中有「開徵財產稅如不能針對豪門，即失節制資本，裁抑巨室之意義，倘以爲工商業良懦可欺，不妨指鹿爲馬，移花接木，則一手難掩天下人耳目，而漠視現實，必召分崩離析之禍」。聲嘶力竭，一至於此！除此而外，工業會籌備會更決議推派代表晋京請願，要求罷議財產稅，但後果如何，恐怕還需要本市工商界作更大的團結與努力吧！</p>
<p>（二）紡織界所需原棉，甚感缺乏，據紗管會代主委王嵐僧發表談話稱，全國現尙存棉三十萬包，靑黃不接期間，尙缺棉四十萬包，倘美援棉花分十二個月撥付，則到十月底止，只能運用十七萬五千包，所缺二十多萬包，除非外銷紗布換棉及收購有辦法，否則毫無把握。上週週三，六區棉紡公會召開理監事會，亦因原棉缺乏，通過緊急議案一件，決議各廠存棉不濟，紗管會無法緊張接濟，迫不得已先减工百分之二十，看來目前我國首屈一指的棉紡織業，亦非减縮生產以應景不可了！</p>
<p>（三）推廣銷路，本來是民營工商業唯一的出路，最近於十九日開幕由中華國產廠商聯合會主辦的國貨展覽大會，其用意亦在此。但是，一方面提倡國貨不遺餘力，一方面却發現大批成本甚低的印花綢緞走私貨，在市上泛濫傾銷，至於日貨呢絨的標售問題，前雖經國產商廠一度抗議，但據報載中信局仍將繼續標售，兩方面對照起來，却是。種深刻的諷刺！</p>
<p>（四）當局對於新稅的頒佈，果然躍躍欲試，而對於舊稅的增加，亦不遣餘力，據大公社消息，關於本市營業稅率前經財部決定恢復稅率爲百分之三後，曾爲市參議會五次大會所否決。現悉財政部業已電令市財政局，仍須將稅率加倍，提高至百分之三（原爲百分之一·五），可見參議會的所謂否決，作用亦甚微弱，民營工商業處境的惡劣，恐迫是空前未有的吧！（中國工商協會）</p>

<h3>惠勃爾登網球賽　今日決男單冠軍　澳洲勃朗維區美國法根堡　爭奪世界網球皇座</h3>
<p>〔路透社惠勃爾登卅日電〕一九四八年之惠勃爾登男子單打冠軍，定於星期五由澳洲勃朗維區，與美國法根堡爭奪，在今日之半決賽中，勃朗維區以六—三，十四—十二，六—二淘汰匈牙利阿斯　斯，法根堡以六—四，六—四，八—六，克美國莫洛埃。勃朗維區與阿斯波斯之戰，爲一歷時二小時又十分之消耗戰，此雙手澳洲大將賴其底綫長抽，逐漸使對方疲於奔命，雙方打來毫無火氣，罕見猛烈之抽擊，第見捉弄作風之擊球，實爲惠勃爾登中央球塲多年來未見之球賽。勃阿兩人，似係照書本上之法而擊，令人憶及網球賽初期之古典擊法。勃朗維區於第一盤時勝來較易，至第二盤歷時八十五分鐘之久始由勃氏取勝，於該盤中阿斯波斯僅於四—三，八—七時兩度超出，於八—七時，祗須再獲兩分即可取勝該盤，不幸竟未如願以償，第三盤勃氏愈戰愈勇，在十七分鐘內，以六—二結束。</p>
<p>法根堡與莫洛埃之戰，完全近代爆炸作風，與勃朗維區阿斯波斯之戰逈異，全局歷時僅一小時許，法根堡以第七種子選手，擊敗第三種子選手之莫洛埃，不無出人意外。法根堡多賴其發球及壓球取勝，有謂各再賽一盤，法氏恐難免反勝爲敗，在第三盤中，一度成六—六平手，不料莫洛埃發球失算，而法根堡發球取勝，遂決定最後命運。</p>
<p>男子雙打次決賽有冷門，列爲第四組種子選手之南菲史都吉斯及英國莫特朗，竟敗於非種子選手之瑞典貝格林及澳洲哈伯，比數六—三，六—四，六—四，貝哈組在半決賽中，將遇美國湯勃則及莫洛埃。特設施診部免收醫藥費盡服務之能事</p>

<h3>談邱翁回憶録</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>大戰結束後，回憶錄之類的東西在國外似頗盛行。繼本報的「赫爾回憶錄」之後，英國戰時首相邱吉爾的大戰回憶錄第一卷已於本年六月廿一日在紐約出版，全書迎名第二次世界大戰」，據說一共將有五卷，目前尙未完成，大槪全書出版尙有二三年，或需更長的時期，因根據刋登該書第一卷節本的「紐約時報」記載，其第二卷須於明年一月始在該報續登，而「紐約時報」對於佳作的刊登向來不甘落於出版商之後，故估計全書完成至少尙有二三年。</p>
<p>惟據筆者所知，邱翁大作的中文譯本，在七月份中至少將有三種譯本出現，其中的一本是全譯本，據說係向原出版關係人取得優先出版權，另外兩本一即是根據「紐約時報」的節譯本，另一南京方面出版的，大槪也是節譯本。一般說來，能看原本固然最好，次之則爲原本的全譯本；不過我認爲回憶錄一類的東西，因往往夾雜許多文件之類，故除非認認眞眞當作史料研究，則比較適當的節譯本，於時間與物力雙方，亦有可取之處。尤其在我們目前出版條件與購買力都困難的今日，節譯本自有其客觀的需要。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰是人類歷史上的一件大事件，其影響至今猶激盪人間，舉凡現在的一切國際糾紛，仍是與第二次世界大戰保持着一脈相承的關係，實際上第二次世界大戰的戰爭形式雖吿結束（其實嚴格說來，就連戰爭的形式也不能說已經結束，例如聯合各國迄今猶未對德日正式成立和約，在技術上仍是交戰國關係），其歷史的因素則猶在繼續發展中。故眞正以史家的眼光研究此大事件猶非其時，一般人所亟需知道的，倒是有關此大事件的種種內幕，也就是所謂野史或外史，因此回憶錄一類作品便應運而生了。</p>
<p>我雖將回憶錄一類的作品譬作野史，但並沒有看輕之意；其別於正史的，僅前者往往是散漫的，未經系統整理的，而寫作的態度當然也是大多出諸主觀，有時且不諱飾其偏見。但也正唯其如此，反使讀者感到親切而富有現實感，較之讀那些冰冷了的正史遠有活氣。而且回憶錄究竟有別於一般不經之談的野史，它們實在是將來史家的寳貴材料。</p>
<p>如果說「赫爾回憶錄」是羅斯福執政時期的美國政治丙幕，則邱吉爾的那本「第二世界大戰」，其內容就廣泛複雜得多了。　爾僅是美國的一個文人政治家，而邱吉爾則不僅是兩朝戰爭的元老，保守黨的領袖，且同時還是一個出色的軍人。其能文能武的雄才，大概祗有現任哥侖比亞大學校長的艾森豪威爾將軍堪與倫比，但邱翁在政治上的魄力，則就是艾將軍也難企及。邱翁在其回憶錄中寫到他出任戰時首相時，曾自豪地說他對此大任當時絲毫也不覺得興奮與驚異，他自信他過去的一切，就是爲的準備他有此一天，並自信他是一與命運同行一的一個人。如果這幾句出諸當代任何第二人之口，一定會使讀者感到幾分肉麻，但回顧對德戰爭四年中英國所經歷的驚風駭浪，而終於以最後勝利的姿態出現，誰說邱翁不應該作此大語哉！</p>
<p>不過邱吉爾也許仍有他的悲哀。在第一卷的結末他曾說過這樣幾句話：「在我們所有的敵人都已或將要無條件投降的時候，我的選民決意解除我掌理他們事務的職位了。」（大意如此）保守黨在一九四五年大選舉中的失敗，也許是爲邱吉爾所意料不及的。但邱翁的臨危受命，功成身退，豈僅襯托了他個人的偉大，且亦充分表示了英國政黨政治的民主風度。</p>
<p>因爲看了幾本英美出版的回憶錄作品，引起了我一個題外的感想。像英美這樣的國家，雖然還有人在批評他們是假民主或僞民主，然而他們究竟還有一輩退休後的政治家肯用文筆來吿訴我們一些戰爭的經過與內慕，有時且坦然承認他們的錯誤。也許有人會說這仍不渦是「冷戰」的一部份，其目的在於自我宣傳。不過我們肥該承認，當一個人肯用文筆來表現他自己的時候，他的表現過程總多少包含着一種良心的自省成份在內。這較之純粹謀略性的宣傳文字究竟不可同日而語。例如英美外交機關所局部發表的戰時德國的外交秘密文獻，及蘇聯對此而發的一歷史的虛偽因素」，其所以不能如赫爾與邱吉爾等人的回憶錄一樣受人重視，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>世界幾時始可見到歌舞昇平的景象，誰也不能預言；不渦我相信如果現在所有國際舞台上的重要角色都能退隱歸野，寫些他們的回憶錄，則在他們個人反省思索之餘，也許對於世界和平倒能盡其一部份的貢獻罷？</p>
<h3>「子曰」</h3>
<p>— 錢文</p>
<p>孔家店被打一事，早已給人視爲陳迹了；當時破壞到什麼程度，不得而知。至今還有人在意到時拋進去幾塊瓦片，其破壞力却遠不及五四前後的那末大。孔道據說大到大下莫能容，幸而尙未到非「有容」的時代。對於這一種道，我沒有認眞研究過，說也說不淸楚。</p>
<p>他老先生說女子難養，如果單是鈔出這四個字，非侮辱女性而何？然而我明知不是指我家裏的母親，諸姑，姊妹，老婆，千金，娘姨，又不是指農婦，工人，以至社會上的明星「××」之花」等人，所以我對他不起惡感。他雖然常說君臣之義，却絕不可以治以反民主之罪。凡是他的言行，屬於非現代的，我也不感興趣，例如朝，侍食於君，入太廟之類。他不肯交給顏路的車，不是汽車，賣了又沒有公共汽車，電車，交通車可坐。</p>
<p>自某年以來，美國人頗以說聲孔夫子爲時髦，我却很不愛聽英美人說到他。英芙人對於小事常常自以爲是，例如讀字音。他們把用羅馬字母拚成爲「孔夫子」讀成有點像他們的「混亂」這個字。不過我決不向他們抗議，因爲我們稱「荷馬」時也祗有我國人聽得懂，英，美，德，荷，法，意，希各有其稱法，也是各人自以爲是。</p>
<p>近來報上所載的文件裘，多有引用子曰的。這不是證明孔道大行，而是證明孔氏之遺書不可不讀，就是學理科的莘莘學子也要讀，否則文件引用出來時，不知所謂了。引用古語於說話行文或打官司頗覺便利，尤其是引孔子曰。凡引古語，都是　其合於我用者然後引之。如仁者自當引「爲富不仁矣」，而好貨者引「爲仁不富矣」是必然的。古語也可以略爲修改，取便於我，譬如忠厚長者，說「寗人負我，母我負人」，而奸雄則必曰「寗我負人，母人負我」。引子曰者，因爲是大聖先師之言，修改之舉，尙未之見也。</p>
<p>凡引子曰，應該有個原則。舉例以明之。引君子如何則可，引小人如何則不可。說君子則是說大家都是君子，說小人則似乎以小人待人，故不可不愼。又如語貴吉祥，說邦有追是無論何時都令人喜悅的，反之則糟。</p>
<p>孔子是個很會說話的人，讀他的遺言，時覺有搔着我心中癢處之妙。這是我個人的私見，自以不披露爲是，想談下去，也不必了。</p>

<p>幽默大師馬克吐溫在一九二九年因盡量向機器方面投資，結果全部產業損失殆盡，窮得債積如山，只剩下了廚房的烟筒！</p>
<p>名小說「魏克費爾牧師傅」的作者高爾司密斯，曾爲了欠房資而被逮捕。</p>

<h3>馬肉援歐</h3>
<p>— 何島</p>
<p>從美國運輸到歐洲各國的救濟食品之中，有一件東西所佔的數世極大，而官方文吿中從未提起過——這一樣凍西就是馬肉。</p>
<p>據美國名記者羅勃脫·亞侖最近的報道，在去年一年中，運歐的馬肉總額在一萬萬磅以上。爲甚麼把那麼多馬肉運出去呢？第一個原因是：馬肉的價錢便宜，它的價錢不到其他肉類的一半。而且，歐洲國家似乎並不對馬肉有什麽偏見（美國人現在是不要吃馬肉的），據說有幾國的人民還覺得馬肉的滋味比別種肉類更鮮，也有人說馬肉比別稱肉乾凈馬肉最大的主顧是比利時和瑞典兩國，最近在一個月中，運往比利時的馬肉達三百萬磅，運往瑞典的也達二百萬磅。其他如德·法·荷·葡等國，也有很多人要吃馬肉。</p>
<p>美國人本來從不吃馬肉，直到一九三〇年至一九三二一年的大不景氣時代，才開始有屠馬塲，殺馬供食；那時每年殺馬約十萬匹。到了去年，爲了救濟歐洲災民，一年中殺了三十萬匹。以前被殺的馬都是老疲不堪的贏馬，但近來那些老馬已經殺完，所以去年殺的都是年紀還不大老的馬了，都是野馬。現在已開設了不少屠馬塲，最大的幾處開設在洛杉磯，舊金山，底德律。</p>
<h3>「請願」</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>「請願」二字，在現在已成爲一通常名詞，人民對政府，官廳有所請求，或有所陳訴，謂之「請願」。而用文字表達此種意見的，謂之「請願書」。據畏廬瑣記載，「請願」二字出於漢書。但二字連用，殊覺費解。瑣記中云：「余門人某生，作請願書萬言，將上之某部。余讀之，其所用字，多不可曉，不惟難曉，但請願二字，亦大費解。漢書京房傳，元帝於是以房爲魏郡太守，秩八百石，居得以考功德治郡。房自請願無屬刺史，得用他郡人。按請願二字雖出於此，應停頓讀之。「房自請」作一句，「願無屬刺史」作一句，彼迎用請願二字，殆誤讀漢書耳。不期爲之一笑。」夫天下事習非成是者正復多多，又豈僅「請願」二字而已。</p>
<h3>地墓</h3>
<p>— 敏亦</p>
<p>在都市最煩囂的心臟區域，在我們一天廿四小時不斷人聲機器聲的辦公處所的對面，橫着一方稀有平靜的綠地。矮矮的圍牆，疏疏落落幾簇冬靑，幾顆大樹，將繁華喧囂的人世，宛如隔成了兩個世界。</p>
<p>它像是我們這幢大廈的一個影子，孤寂無望地永遠仰視着我們忙忙碌碌。白天難得有人跡，夜晚沒有一絲燈光。只有綠地上幾十塊零零落落的墓碑，似乎在提醒人家這是一個什麼地方。</p>
<p>冬天，這一片地上舖滿白雪，白雪上却沒有鞋印；春天，這一片地上盪漾着綠意，也沒有遊客的笑聲。初夏的雨絲輕輕洗拂去墓蓋上的灰塵，權充了憑弔的眼淚。</p>
<p>一年，二年，三年，連我也懶得去看看，雖然我們是天天隔窗相望的鄰居</p>
<p>其實，鄰居們的身世，不看也不難想像的：他們有的是妻子最敬愛的丈夫，有的是父母最寵愛的子女。也許是曾受千百學生崇敬欽佩的老敎授，也許是鞭影蹄聲曾經叱咤一時的大商人。現在却毫無分別地讓一方方圓柱方蓋，作爲最後的標誌，在沉默中消磨無底的歲月。</p>
<p>他們一定也曾有過孤舟汪洋的經歷，度過不知多少次人生的風波。他們一定也曾爲了愛人離別而流淚，爲了事業成功而欣喜，爲了親友死亡而嗟傷，現在却毫無例外地安息在這同一的地方，被迫着忘却仇敵與朋友，愛憎與悲樂，等待着時間浪潮的淹沒。</p>
<p>矮矮圍牆護衛着這一片安息的地方，日復一日，年復一年，迎它也有些支離斑駁了，說不定什麽時候便會傾圯。只是它還是那麽毫無表情地護衛着這一片幽靈安息的地方，呆望着熙來攘往的世人，爲生與死劃分了一條淡淡的界綫。</p>

<p>編纂原岡稿爲一百萬分之一。而原圖比例多爲五萬分之一，其數量多至七千餘幅。吾人若僅藉少數之縮放儀器逐一縮製，則全部至少需時三年，故不得不藉照像之力。在開始之時，第一步工作爲招請大量人員，以五萬分一原因將所需之地點及地形用粗筆勾出，應用攝影方法縮小二十倍成百萬分一比例尺之小岡塊，每塊爲廿三公厘寬十八公厘高。將此項圖塊按照圖角之位置貼入投影格中，成百萬分一之鑲嵌圖，包括一切所需之點綫。——河流等高綫以及地點道路等等，因無伸縮之繪圖膠片描繪之。此項膠片即送入測量局製圖廠中代爲製版。將原圖縮小五分之三，成一百六十餘萬分一比例尺，製成鋅版，應用轉版紙轉移至預定圖幅之投影格上。然後印製藍圖。每　共計四張，將來分繪河流，地形，人文及公路等版。各圖幅皆用繪圖紙裱於鋅版之上，如此可免伸縮，而减少套印之錯誤。</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Opens a Secret Meeting Today to Discuss the National Budget; Commodity Price Issues Will Also Be Raised for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, hosted a reception for reporters at 5:00 PM on the 1st, appealing for their assistance in maintaining the confidentiality of the Yuan's meetings. Sun first stated that the purpose of the reception was, in accordance with the Yuan's resolution, to exchange views with reporters on the release of news from the Yuan, and that there was no other intention, so please do not misunderstand. He then explained that the Yuan was holding a secret meeting in accordance with the law, and that it was closed to the public in order to avoid publicizing matters under discussion that should not be disclosed or were not yet ready for disclosure, so as to avoid negative impacts. Furthermore, the piecemeal release of news could easily lead to misunderstandings. For the sake of national security and social stability, it was necessary to imitate the secret nature of general administrative meetings. The extraordinary meeting on June 24 involved military secrets, and leaks that could be learned by the enemy should be prevented. News that could stimulate commodity prices and harm the lives of ordinary people and the national finances should naturally be avoided as much as possible from being published. He personally believed that secret meetings easily lead to speculation and rumors, causing anxiety, and should be open to the public. It is exceptional for a national parliament to hold secret meetings in peacetime, as transparency in public affairs and winning the trust of the people are fundamental principles of a democratic country. However, if the country is suffering from calamities, secret meetings are necessary for national security. Sun further clarified that the secret meeting on the 2nd was to hear the government's report on the preparation of the budget for the second half of the year, and that this measure was taken to allow the Executive Yuan to speak freely and for the Legislative Yuan to gain a full understanding. He said: Although the meeting is called secret, reporters can naturally know the situation of the meeting, but please keep it in mind for the time being, and report it after a decision is made. At this point, he cited the resignation of former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton as an example, pointing out the importance that parliaments in democratic countries attach to budget proposals. In the UK, the budget proposal can be made public nationwide after it is submitted to the House of Commons. However, at the beginning of constitutional governance in China, the Legislative Yuan decided to wait until a resolution was reached before making it public to society, as a measure to avoid stimulating public sentiment and affecting commodity prices during this extraordinary period. At the same time, the issue of commodity prices will also be reviewed at the meeting, and it is hoped that reporters will help to keep the matter confidential. Sun emphasized at the end that the press in democratic countries has a close relationship with parliament, and the development of democratic politics in China especially relies on reporters and members of the Legislative Yuan to strengthen contact and work together. Finally, he accepted the suggestions of many reporters and promised to provide as much convenience as possible for future news coverage of the Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The second secret meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 2nd to discuss the central government's total revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of the 37th year. The draft general budget for ordinary departments and the draft implementation regulations have been submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan, along with policy guidelines, implementation plans, and compilation and review methods. The draft special revenue and expenditure budget has also been submitted separately. Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan will attend the meeting along with Chief of Accounting Xu Kan and Finance Minister Wang Yunwu to explain matters related to the preparation of the total budget. At the same time, they will report on the problem of soaring commodity prices, and Governor Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank has also been invited to attend to answer questions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Kuomintang legislators held a discussion meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 1st to exchange views on the general budget to be submitted by the Executive Yuan. Weng Wenhao, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Yunwu, Xu Kan, and others in charge attended the meeting and gave a detailed explanation of the general budget. Legislators also offered some opinions, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Bilateral Agreement to Be Signed Tomorrow in Nanjing; Wang Shijie and Stuart Leiden Represent the Two Countries in the Signing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Sino-US bilateral agreement on the principles for the use of US aid funds to China, originally scheduled to be signed on the 2nd, has been postponed to July 3 due to a certain technical issue. Minister Wang Shijie and US Ambassador Stuart Leiden will represent the Chinese and US governments in the signing in Nanjing. Three documents will be signed at that time: the main text of the Sino-US bilateral agreement, the exchange of notes, and an annex. This reporter learned from relevant sources that the content of the "agreement" to be signed on July 3 includes the principles for the use of US economic aid funds of US$275 million, including special construction expenses of US$60 million, and agricultural reconstruction expenses. The agreement also includes a preamble explaining the spirit of the US aid to China bill. The "Annex" includes definitions of certain terms in the "Agreement" and supplementary explanations. It is also learned that since the US Congress passed the Foreign Aid Act, including the Aid to China Act, on April 3, and after the exchange of notes between the Chinese Ambassador to the US and the US on April 30 to establish a temporary agreement, the Chinese government has actively negotiated with the US side to conclude the official agreement. According to the previous Sino-US exchange of notes, July 3 is the final deadline for concluding and signing the agreement. Most of the discussions on the Sino-US bilateral agreement were conducted in Nanjing. The US side changed the clauses in the draft three times, and deliberated on the wording more than seven or eight times. The final draft agreed upon by both sides was telegraphed by the US Embassy to Washington on the morning of June 29 to seek final instructions. However, due to certain technical details, a completely consistent agreement has not yet been reached. However, according to an authoritative observer who spoke to reporters tonight, it is believed that the differences on this technical issue can be resolved within a few days and will not affect the signing on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our City News] Lapham, the representative of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China, flew to Nanjing yesterday morning to participate in the signing of the Sino-US bilateral agreement on July 3.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The President issued an order on July 1: (1) Appointing Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as the plenipotentiary representative for the negotiation of the Sino-US bilateral agreement on US aid to China. (2) Appointing Zhang Hongjun as the representative to the International Children's Emergency Relief Fund meeting. (3) Approving Yu Hongjun's request to resign from his concurrent position as director of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. (4) Appointing Wang Yunwu as director of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<h3>Hoffman's Remarks</h3>
<p>Economic Aid to China Proceeding Smoothly; Currency Reform Can Be Discussed</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] Hoffman, the director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stated that the Sino-US bilateral agreement will be signed within a few days. Hoffman refused to criticize Senator Bridges' criticism of the State Department for allegedly delaying the military aid to China plan. However, he said: Economic aid to China is proceeding smoothly. According to the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration in the first quarter, it is nearing completion. Therefore, Hoffman stated today that the allocated materials not delivered in the first quarter will be automatically incorporated into the second quarter's allocation. The total value of the materials allocated to China in the first quarter was US$36.5 million, but only materials worth US$26.5 million have been delivered to China. It is reported that the materials allocated to China in the second quarter are worth approximately US$80 million. Hoffman also stated that although not explicitly stipulated in the bilateral agreements, the Economic Cooperation Administration has the right to invite countries participating in the Marshall Plan to discuss currency reform. However, the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of these countries, and is willing to allow them to carry out the currency reform they need on their own. Hoffman said: The position of the Economic Cooperation Administration is the same as that of an investment banker. Therefore, if the recovery work of the recipient country is not satisfactory after the Administration invests, the Administration can stop its assistance or ask the country to correct the situation hindering its development. Hoffman issued a formal statement on the signing of the bilateral agreement, saying: The success or failure of this plan will depend on the efforts of our comrades across the Atlantic.</p>
<h3>Stillman Survey Group Studied Investigation Results Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Will Go to Hangzhou to Inspect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Our City News] The Stillman Survey Group held a meeting all day yesterday to study the results of investigations in various places.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch on the 1st] Stillman and his party are scheduled to go to Hangzhou on the 5th to inspect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Hou Jiayuan has gone to Shanghai and will accompany them to Jiangxi. On the way to Jiangxi on the 6th, the group will inspect the two machine factories on the railway in Xiaoshan and Yushan. After arriving in Nanchang on the morning of the 7th, they will transfer to Zhangshu to inspect the bridge project and the laying of rails. They will return to Nanchang for rest that night and return to Hangzhou by the same train on the 8th. They will stop in Liangjiadu and Guixi to inspect the bridge work and transportation along the way. The Jiangxi Provincial Government is currently drafting a plan to seek US aid and will submit a request for US$3.034 million to Stillman to improve agriculture, provide social relief, build highways, farmland, water conservancy, river defense, and sanitation facilities. The estimated cost of the Guling Mountain Road project is 301.2 billion yuan, and it is also hoped that US aid will be obtained.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan's Transportation Committee Approved a Tripling of Postal Rates; Awaiting the Final Decision of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the morning of the 1st to review the postal rate increase proposal. Chairman Ran Ronggu decided to propose that the proposal sent by the Executive Yuan, namely, a universal threefold increase in postal rates, with ordinary letters costing 20,000 yuan, be adopted. However, She Lingyun, Liu Zhiping, and others believed that postal rates should not be increased, or at most doubled. They reserved their opposition and will record it together with the review results and report it to the Legislative Yuan for discussion and final decision.</p>
<h3>US Military Advisory Group Sends a Team to Guangzhou to Assist China in Reorganizing and Training Its Troops; Actual Training Will Be Conducted by Chinese Officers</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] A team from the US Military Advisory Group, led by Colonel Pauling, went to Guangzhou today to begin advisory work on reorganizing and training three Chinese divisions. This undertaking was announced here by Major General Barr, head of the US Military Mission. In addition to Colonel Pauling, the team includes three advisory officers, two soldiers, one engineer, one medical officer, and two interpreters. It is expected that the team will eventually increase to eleven officers and eight soldiers, whose task is to assist Chinese division commanders and their staff in planning all reorganization and training work, and to provide guidance and advice to the staff in training work. US officers will not directly participate in the actual training. The training work will be conducted by Chinese officers at all levels. The first step will be to provide advice on the training of 100 instructor cadres, who will be divided into small arms committees, tactics committees, and other types of committees. After four weeks, these instructors will train a large cadre for a period of eight weeks. Then, the reorganization and training of the divisions will begin, which will take about six weeks to complete. At the same time, the US Military Advisory Group personnel will provide advice on the administration of the division headquarters.</p>
<h3>The Judicial Yuan Held a Handover Ceremony; Wang Chonghui Took Office; Encouraging Colleagues to Work Together to Complete the Constitutional Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, arrived at the Judicial Yuan at 10:00 AM on the 1st and formally took office. The former President Ju Zheng arrived at the Yuan before 10:00 AM and waited for President Wang to arrive. Then, in the President's office, they handed over the seal. Afterwards, a simple handover ceremony was held in the main hall, and all staff members participated. After the ceremony, Ju first introduced Wang, explaining that Wang's morality and learning were admired by all. Wang had also served as Minister of Justice, and his reappointment as the first President of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution was extremely appropriate. Wang then delivered a speech, expressing his unworthiness of Ju's introduction, and saying that he would continue to ask Ju for guidance at any time. He continued: The current situation is difficult, and constitutional governance and suppression of the rebellion are proceeding simultaneously. He hoped that everyone would work hard for the country to complete the work of suppressing the rebellion and implementing the Constitution. After the ceremony, Wang sent Ju to the door, and all staff members also sent him to the door. Wang then went to his office to begin his duties.</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks</p>
<p>Wang received reporters at his official residence at 5:00 PM and spoke freely about the powers of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution and the interpretation of the Constitution. He first stated that the functions of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution should focus on promoting the rule of law. The most important aspect of the rule of law is compliance with the law, which should be the case for both the government and the people. Second, the laws and regulations should be simplified. It is necessary to sort out any conflicting or overlapping laws and regulations, or those that are not working smoothly. Regarding the interpretation of the Constitution, this work is not easy, because China's Constitution is a system between the British and American constitutions, and the interpretation will be quite difficult. As for the interpretation of the Constitution, it is based on a specific problem that has already occurred, because the Judicial Yuan is not a constitutional research institute. As for who can submit this specific fact to request interpretation, it can be submitted by the agency. The procedure for interpretation will be decided after a meeting of the Grand Justices. When reporters asked if the Judicial Yuan can propose remedial measures after interpreting the Constitution and finding loopholes in it, Wang said: No, the Judicial Yuan is only responsible for interpretation and cannot amend the Constitution. When loopholes or other problems are found, it can only interpret them. Finally, when reporters asked about the party affiliation of the Grand Justices, Wang explained from a personal point of view that judges focus on fair execution and do not value party relations, so (1) they do not have to leave their party affiliation, (2) they cannot participate in party organizations, and (3) they should execute their duties fairly and impartially, and not based on party principles. Wang said: The spirit of the Grand Justices being above party affiliation lies in this, but this is his personal opinion.</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee Decided to Retain the Proposal to Go to Japan for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Delimitation of the Yunnan-Burma Border Was Handed Over to a Subcommittee for Review</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the morning of the 1st. At the meeting, Jian Guansan reported that the Property Tax Subcommittee of the Finance and Economics Committee decided that foreign property should not be given special preferential treatment in taxation in terms of law. The Foreign Affairs Committee's opinion was that there were practical difficulties in foreign relations, and it requested the Finance and Economics Committee to pay attention to this matter again. In addition, the committee enthusiastically discussed Qiu Youzhen's proposal to send a delegation to Japan for investigation, but ultimately decided to retain it because technical problems were not easy to solve. As for Tao Rong's proposal on the delimitation of the Yunnan-Burma border, it was decided to hand it over to a subcommittee for preliminary review.</p>
<h3>Great Victory in the Longshan Battle; The National Army's Qian Boying Brigade Held a Merit Award Ceremony; Combat Heroes Were Selected Mutually</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 1st] The Qian Boying Brigade of the Zhen Duo Division, which was reorganized, won a great victory in Longshan. On the afternoon of the 1st at 4:00 PM, a celebration and merit award ceremony was held in a certain place on the outskirts of Jinan for the officers and soldiers. From among the 10,000+ officers and soldiers, they mutually selected 700+ soldiers and 100+ officers who were most meritorious in this battle as combat heroes. Among them, Liu Zhongchao and others were selected to receive honorary awards, and Chai Xihui and others were selected to receive medals of loyalty and courage. Commander Wang Yaowu personally went to give instructions and encouraged the officers and soldiers to be heroes. After the meeting, there was a celebration dinner and a theatrical performance. It is reported that this merit award ceremony and the election of combat heroes is still an innovation in the National Army.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Passed Through Xuzhou and Flew to Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 1st] Du Yuming arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 1st and flew to Zhengzhou on the same plane after a short rest.</p>
<h3>The Central China Suppression Headquarters Was Formally Established</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 1st] The Central China Suppression Headquarters was formally established today, but no ceremony was held. Commander-in-Chief Bai convened meetings of the military, police, and security chiefs in Wuhan for days to discuss the implementation of an overall war, and had frequent contact with local gentry. The selection of a Deputy Commander-in-Chief has not yet reached the final stage, but it is heard that the position of Chief of Staff will still be concurrently held by Xu Zuyi, and the appointment of Secretary-General Yuan Shouqian has also been approved by the President. Yuan will be able to come to Wuhan to take office soon. In addition, the newly appointed Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Fang has taken office.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Received an Anonymous Threatening Letter in Beiping Last Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] A spokesman for the US Embassy announced on the 1st that Ambassador Stuart Leiden had recently received an anonymous threatening letter in Beiping.

<h3>Proposal to Urge the Government to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Japan; The Control Yuan Decided to Hand It Over for Review; The Drafting Committee for Review Rules Continued Its Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Control Yuan held its fifteenth meeting at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 1st, attended by 112 Control Committee members and chaired by Yu Youren. The Secretariat first read out the minutes of the fourteenth meeting, and the telegram from the Anyang County Council after the loss of Kaifeng affected the suppression of the rebellion and shook the morale of the people, requesting that the responsible personnel be investigated and punished according to law (June). Then, the agenda items were discussed. The item discussed today was still the "Proposal to Urge the Government to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Japan as soon as possible" proposed by Committee Member Zou Lu and others. Many people spoke, and most of the committee members believed that the nature of the case was important and involved various diplomatic and political issues, and should be carefully considered and handed over for review. They all said: Standing in the position of the people, they feel that a peace treaty with Japan should be completed as soon as possible, so that there is something to follow in the attitude towards Japan. This case is not forcing the government to handle it, but promoting the government to complete a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. Others believe that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has handled it improperly, and that our lenient attitude towards Japan has instead been used by the United States to curry favor. However, in general, all the committee members felt that the matter should be carefully considered from the standpoint of the country and handed over for review. Although Zou Lu explained again that this was only to promote the early signing of a peace treaty so that the policy towards Japan could be implemented in accordance with the treaty, it was ultimately approved by a majority vote to be handed over for review after it was put to a vote. Then, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>The Communist Bandits in Eastern Hebei Still Plan to Invade; The Military Observes That the Next Action Is Not Far Off; Shengfang Town in Southwestern Tianjin Was Suddenly Invaded by Bandits</h3>

<h3>The Fierce Battle of Annihilation in Eastern Henan: National Army Has Crushed Five Bandit Columns; Liu Zhi Flies to the Front Line Again to Supervise the Battle from the Air</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 1st dispatch] The battle of annihilation in eastern Henan continues in the area of Suixian, Qixian, and Tongxu. As of this morning, the National Army has crushed five bandit columns. In the south of Tongxu, the entire bandit 3rd Column was crushed. In addition, in the southwest of the county, the majority of the 16th Division of the bandit 6th Column was annihilated.

<p>[Another dispatch] The fierce battle of annihilation in the Yellow River flood area is taking place today in the Longwangdian, Foshan Temple, and Yuxiangpu areas northwest of Suixian. Today, the National Army in Longwangdian is bravely resisting the attacking superior bandit forces, and the fighting is intensifying. Air force squadrons from the Yellow Sea and East China Sea have controlled the skies over the Sui and Qi battlefields all day long, bombing and strafing to assist in the battle. The dense bandit concentrations around Longwangdian and in Guanzhuang, Xugang, and Taozhugang (east of Qixian) are ideal targets for bombing and strafing. In Longwangdian alone, over 2,000 bandits were killed by bombing. The air support is also providing cover for the outer-line army to launch an encirclement and suppression of the bandits. Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi flew over Qixian at 7:00 PM yesterday to convey the President's order to the ground troops and returned to Xuzhou at 11:00 PM.

<p>[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 1st dispatch] The main force of the Chen Geng bandit units, the 4th and 9th Columns, and the 22nd Brigade, have retreated west from near the Pinghan Railway towards western Wan.

<h3>Editorial: The Peace Conference with Japan Should Have Been Held Long Ago!</h3>
<p>The Control Yuan held its 15th general meeting yesterday morning to discuss the "Requesting the Government to Promote a Peace Treaty with Japan as Soon as Possible" proposal put forward by 94 members of the Control Yuan, including Control Member Zou Lu. The Control Members spoke one after another, all advocating urging the government to take proactive diplomatic measures to break the deadlock on the Japan issue and promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Amidst the widespread opposition from various countries concerned in the Far East to the United States' support for Japan, the discussion of this issue by our Control Yuan further illustrates the concern of both the government and the public in our country regarding the Japan issue.</p>
<p>Japan announced its unconditional surrender on August 10, 1945, and formally signed the surrender on the USS Missouri on September 2, almost three full years ago. However, the peace conference with Japan to clean up the post-war Far East situation has not yet been convened, and the prospects are still distant and uncertain. The conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan is even more out of the question. Three years is not a short time in terms of time. It is truly an unprecedented strange phenomenon in modern history. A peace treaty cannot guarantee permanent peace in the Far East, but without a peace treaty with Japan, the Far East cannot enter a normal state from a state of war. Therefore, whether it is for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the sake of the interests of the countries concerned in the Far East, it is necessary to convene a peace conference and conclude a treaty as soon as possible. The current stalemate in the Far East is caused by many factors, but the most important one is that the United States and the Soviet Union not only have different views on the Japan issue, but also have their own plans, which has caused the Far Eastern Commission, which is responsible for drafting the peace treaty with Japan, to stall. The division of opinions among the Allies on Japan has, of course, first struck the Far Eastern countries that were invaded by Japan, especially China. Caught between the two poles, we feel the pain of being caught in a dilemma everywhere. Moreover, watching the rapid change in the United States' policy toward Japan and the booming recovery of Japan, how can we not feel fear and deeply worry that Japan's recovery will be a threat to peace in the Far East and the security of our country! Therefore, the recent anti-support-Japan speeches by some people in our society have arisen from this. The unanimous advocacy of our government and the public to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible to conclude a peace treaty with Japan is also for this reason.</p>
<p>Even if we disregard the reasons for our country's advocacy of convening a peace conference as soon as possible, all other countries concerned with Japan also hope to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a speech at the Labor Party's annual meeting in May of this year, also requesting that the countries that participated in the Pacific War convene a peace conference as soon as possible to resolve this most thorny issue of Japan. He explained his reasons, saying, "If we want to solve the Far East problem, we should first conclude a peace treaty with Japan." Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal was not only supported by the British people, but also welcomed by the people of the Far East. Only the United States' attitude is lukewarm, and it still has no intention of breaking the deadlock on the Japan issue. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on May 19, the United States diplomatic authorities believe that the peace conference with Japan may be postponed indefinitely. It is said that the United States believes that it is still not appropriate to convene a peace conference with Japan, and the reasons it holds are: (1) it does not believe that the Soviet Union will give up its veto power; (2) it does not believe that the peace conference with Japan can succeed; (3) most of the eleven countries in the Far East oppose the United States' policy of supporting Japan, and their opinions on other issues are also quite inconsistent. From this, it can be seen that the crux of the delay in convening the peace conference with Japan lies in the procedural issue of convening the peace conference with Japan and the divergence of opinions among the Allies on the basic issue of Japan.</p>
<p>Regarding the former, the United States initially proposed that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission hold a meeting to draft the peace treaty with Japan, adopting a one-third majority voting system, and no country should exercise its veto power. The Soviet Union was the first to express opposition to the United States' proposal and put forward a counter-proposal, advocating that the foreign ministers of the four powers, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, draft the peace treaty with Japan, and that the four powers must reach a consensus; in other words, the four powers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can all exercise veto power over the peace treaty. The opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely opposite, but in order to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, our country put forward a compromise plan, advocating that the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission organize a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, adopting a majority vote; however, any resolution must include the consent of the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the date of this meeting shall also be determined by the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union through consultation. Looking back today, if the United Kingdom had not firmly supported the United States' proposal at that time, the compromise plan put forward by China might have been accepted by both the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, if China and the United Kingdom continue to work hard to mediate the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, it is not impossible to reach an agreement on the procedure for convening the peace conference.</p>
<p>As for the latter, from China to Australia and the Philippines, all the Far Eastern countries that have been invaded by Japan oppose the United States' support for Japan's recovery. Because the people of the Far Eastern countries, standing on the position of patriotism, even if they can understand the United States' policy toward Japan, it is impossible for them not to oppose Japan's recovery threatening their security. If the United States does not respect their opinions and wishes and allows the situation to continue to unfold, no matter how the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo responds to the anti-American and pro-Japanese sentiment of the Far Eastern countries, it will ultimately not help to clarify the situation in the Far East, and the result will be that the United States' diplomacy in the Far East may fall into isolation. Therefore, even if the United States does not consider its own interests, it should clarify the public opinion of the Far Eastern countries and convene a peace conference with Japan to conclude a treaty, which is the only fundamental solution. As long as a peace conference with Japan is convened in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, all issues are resolved fairly, and a fair and impartial peace treaty with Japan is concluded and uniformly observed by the Allies; in this way, not only will the United States not be solely responsible for the control of Japan, but the Far Eastern countries will not have conflicts with the United States over the Japan issue, which benefits both itself and others. Why not do it? Please think carefully about this, diplomatic authorities of the United States.</p>
<p>In short, now is the most appropriate time to convene a peace conference with Japan. We believe that our country's diplomatic authorities will be able to take proactive diplomatic measures to promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan; because in the past three years, our country's diplomatic authorities have always paid attention to the development of this issue and have always wanted to promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan. As long as our people seize the appropriate time, follow the path of people's diplomacy, declare the people's will and wishes, and support the government in arguing on the basis of reason, it will not be difficult to achieve the goals of our country's diplomatic policy. On the contrary, if we do not know how to use people's diplomacy and blindly shout slogans, it will inevitably lead to the opposite result.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony for Air Force Academy Students: President Chiang Kai-shek Personally Issued Instructions Encouraging Them to Establish a Model of Modern Air Force</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st dispatch] The Air Force Academy held a grand graduation ceremony on the 1st, presided over by Principal Hu Weike, and Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou also attended and delivered instructions in person. After holding the graduation ceremony for the 25th class, the completion ceremony for the 27th class, and the commencement ceremony for the 28th class, they visited the campus and held the dedication ceremony for the Jianqiao Road, which was built by the academy itself. The activities, including sports and a performance of the play "Heavenly Kingdom Spring and Autumn," did not end until late at night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 1st dispatch] President Chiang Kai-shek specially issued the following instructions to the graduating students of the 25th class of the Air Force Academy: Today, students, you have completed your final course of study. At a time when national construction is important, you will surely make significant contributions to the country in the future. In addition to being pleased, Zhongzheng would like to offer a few points to encourage you: First, you should recognize the responsibility of building the army and building the country. During the most difficult period of the War of Resistance, you students responded to the call of young people to join the army and voluntarily enlisted for training. Your ambitions were very grand, aiming to build the nation through revolution. The first step must be to build the army to ensure the victory of the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has ended for three years, the communist bandits' rebellion has intensified, hindering the country's unification and construction and threatening the nation's survival and freedom. Therefore, the second step must be to build the army to accomplish the task of suppressing the rebellion. Building the army and building the country are closely related. According to the meaning of "no air defense is no national defense," the construction of the air force is particularly important and urgent. You students are the backbone of the air force and should be even more aware of the great responsibility you will bear in the future. The work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country will not be completed until the rebellion is suppressed and the country is built. Second, you should develop the spirit of both wisdom and courage. The 20th century has entered the age of atomic energy. Due to scientific progress, the speed of air force construction has been accelerated. In the future, you students must continue to study humbly and strive for perfection in your service process to enhance your new intelligence. At the same time, with a spirit of great fearlessness, prepare to fight and sacrifice yourselves at any time to save the country and the people, and make contributions to the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions have shown us that we must "learn skills and understand life and death." Our air force must have these spiritual conditions in order to establish a model of modern air force. Third, you should cherish material resources and strengthen combat effectiveness. Our country's science and industry are backward, and the aviation industry is still in its infancy. All material equipment depends almost entirely on foreign supplies. In the future, you students must take great care of all machinery, equipment, and weapons, eliminate waste, and make full use of them to maximize their effectiveness. If you students can understand the difficulty of the country's financial and material resources, it is actually tantamount to enhancing the country's unlimited strength in national defense. I hope that you will deeply understand the above three points and faithfully implement them. Today is the most difficult period for national construction, and it is also a good opportunity for you students to succeed and establish a career. The country expects you students to be very eager. The task is heavy and the road is long, so let us encourage each other. Chiang Kai-shek</p>

<h3>Meeting of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly: Wei Daoming Hopes to Assist in the Purchase of Surplus Grain from Large Landlords in Order to Promote the Interests of the Public with Some of the Profits</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Taipei, 1st dispatch] The fifth session of the first Taiwan Provincial Assembly opened today, with 32 provincial assembly members attending, chaired by Huang Chaoqin. In his opening speech, Wei Daoming said: He hopes to promote the interests of the public with some of the profits. In other words, he hopes to assist the provincial government in the policy of purchasing surplus grain from large landlords in the grain policy to maintain social stability. Today and tomorrow, the conference is a preparatory meeting, and the general report on governance will begin on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Li Lianchun Discusses Taiwan's Grain Policy</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] At the press conference of the Provincial Information Office, Grain Bureau Director Li Lianchun reported on the grain policy, saying: The grain policy of this province adopts a management policy that combines political and economic forces. In other words, it uses political forces to ban grain exports and control grain sources, and uses economic forces to enable the government to control a part of the grain and transport and sell it by itself to regulate prices. At present, the government controls more than 180,000 tons of grain. When grain prices fluctuate, it will sell it at par in Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, Hsinchu and other consumption points. Therefore, the current highest retail price is 95 yuan per catty, which is about 40% of the grain price in the mainland. However, in order to achieve the goal of controlling grain, the government must purchase surplus grain from large landlords. Because a few people criticize the government for the low purchase price, and even hope to stop the purchase, they do not know that large landlords in this province only account for three-thousandths of the total population, and the interests in between can be seen. Li Qiang emphasized the importance of this province's grain in the national economic status, saying: If the central government can supply 400,000 tons of fertilizer, this province can have a surplus of 500,000 tons of grain to supply the mainland, so that the grain shortage can be avoided. At present, this province produces 990,000 tons of rice, with a slight surplus.</p>

According to Sun, the businesses run by the Resources Commission can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) electricity, (2) factories, and (3) mining. In detail, it can be divided into eleven types: (1) coal mines, (2) metal plating, (3) oil mines, (4) electricity, (5) steel, (6) machinery industry, (7) electrical engineering, (8) chemical industry, (9) sugar, (10) paper, (11) cement. In terms of regions, the businesses run by the Resources Commission are distributed in seven regions: (1) Northeast, (2) North China, (3) Taiwan, (4) Central China, (5) South China, (6) Northwest, (7) Southwest. The construction in the Northwest and Southwest regions has achieved results during the War of Resistance. Central and South China were occupied by the enemy during the War of Resistance, and the construction was very small. The industry in the three regions of Northeast China, North China, and Taiwan is very developed, but the construction in the three regions is currently the most difficult. Taking Northeast China as an example, one is because most of the industrial equipment was dismantled and moved by the Soviet Union, and the other is due to the destruction of the communist bandits. In addition, most of the Northeast region is occupied by the communist bandits, and construction is very difficult. In North China, Pingjin's factories and mines continue to operate, but some areas are also occupied by the communist bandits. There are many industrial and mining enterprises in Taiwan. Before the enemy surrendered, they were bombed by Allied aircraft, and the losses were quite heavy. In the past two years, they have been actively constructed, and the industry and mines have made progress. It is believed that there will be production output in the future. Among the above eleven businesses, coal, steel, oil, and electricity are the central work. In terms of machinery, Taiwan Sugar's production also occupies an extremely important position. As for the staff of the Resources Commission, there are a total of 220,000 people. The losses in the Northeast were very large. Excellent engineers such as Zhang Xinfu and Yu Zailin were killed by the communist bandits. When the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant retreated, many specialized talents were also captured by the communist bandits. Sun continued to answer reporters' questions, saying: Among the various businesses run by the Resources Commission, electricity accounts for about 60% of the country, and steel accounted for 99% of the country before Anshan fell, but it has been greatly reduced. However, after the Shijingshan Iron Mine in North China starts production, pig iron can still be self-sufficient. Coal production accounted for 35% of the country last year, but now only the Fushun and Benxihu coal mines are producing. Most of the other major mines are occupied by the communist bandits, and it is less than 20%. A reporter asked if the focus of chicken construction will be shifted to South China? Sun smiled and said: This is difficult to answer, but industrial construction cannot be completed in a short period of time and must be placed in a safe place. If the focus of industrial construction is threatened by the communist bandits at any time, it will be in danger of abandoning the previous achievements. The reporter asked what plans the Resources Commission has for the use of US aid? Sun replied that a plan has been drawn up to open coal mines in Xiangtan, Hunan and Pingxiang, Jiangxi. This plan has been submitted to Stilwell.</p>

<h3>Commissioner of Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Liu Wei-chi, Discusses Methods of Utilizing Overseas Chinese Capital:  Remittances Should Be Purchased at Free Market Prices</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st]  Regarding the issues of utilizing Overseas Chinese resources and attracting Overseas Chinese remittances, Liu Wei-chi, the Commissioner of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, recently spoke to reporters about effective measures.  Liu stated that there are over ten million Overseas Chinese residing abroad, distributed throughout the world.  After the end of World War II, many countries still restricted Overseas Chinese from remitting money back home.  However, these countries that restrict Overseas Chinese remittances do not restrict the export of Overseas Chinese goods.  Therefore, given the increasingly serious situation of anti-Chinese movements, the government should comprehensively consider how to utilize Overseas Chinese goods to enable them to be shipped back to the motherland in large quantities to supplement the necessary production materials, and formulate concrete and effective measures for swift implementation.  Recently, the government has made some changes to the import of Overseas Chinese goods at the request of the Overseas Chinese Affairs authorities and Overseas Chinese, but the scope is still insufficient.  It should expand the base as much as possible so that the import of all Overseas Chinese goods does not necessarily have to be handled by the government.  It should only impose reasonable restrictions on the use of funds from the sale of goods under government guidance.  The method of restriction can specify generous interest rates, so that the Overseas Chinese capital can be stored in national banks, or stipulate that a portion of the Overseas Chinese capital be designated by the government to purchase production-related materials or raw materials from abroad and then import them for national use, or designate it to purchase government bonds and various government-issued securities.  In this way, the Overseas Chinese will surely be happy to comply and accept.  As for Overseas Chinese remittances, before the war, the average annual income from Overseas Chinese remittances alone reached more than 100 million US dollars.  Our country's international payments depended on this to barely maintain balance.  After the war broke out, the amount of Overseas Chinese remittances decreased significantly.  After the end of the war, Overseas Chinese remittances should have greatly increased.  However, because the official exchange rate of the US dollar is too far from the free market price, the value of the currency depreciates when it is remitted back to the motherland, resulting in widespread avoidance.  Although the government has made various improvements to Overseas Chinese remittances, it still feels insufficient.  According to Commissioner Liu's opinion, the improvement measures can be summarized into two points: first, all Overseas Chinese remittances should be purchased at the free market price of the day; second, the government should allow Overseas Chinese to freely bring in foreign currency, gold, or foreign securities, etc.  However, to prevent them from engaging in speculative behavior, the imported gold or foreign currency can be registered at the time of import.  If the carrier needs to sell it, the government can purchase it at the free market price of the day.  If this can be done, it can achieve lasting results.</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Releases Weekly War Situation Report: Focus of Central Plains War Shifts from Western Shandong to Eastern Henan</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Ministry of National Defense released the weekly war situation report from June 24th to June 30th as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Central Plains War: The focus of the war this week has shifted from western Shandong to eastern Henan.</p>
<p>1. Kaifeng Campaign: Chen Yi's 3rd, 8th, and 10th columns, since June 16th, sneaked into Kaifeng via the southern Henan corridor. Their original intention was still to respond to the main force of Chen's bandits moving south. While our army was reinforcing Kaifeng, Chen's 1st, 4th, and 6th columns and the Guangdong-Guangxi Rapid Columns sneaked into the triangular area of Nanqi County, Tongxu, and Minquan south of the Longhai Railway, echoing the 3rd, 8th, and 10th columns. In addition, Chen Geng's 9th column was in the Zhongmu and Baisha area, obstructing our western route National Army from advancing towards Kaifeng, while at the same time coordinating with Liu's 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th columns and Chen Geng's 4th column near Xiping and Shangcai to delay the progress of our southern route army. In total, the bandits used more than 100,000 troops to block our reinforcement of Kaifeng, but this also gave the National Army a chance to defeat them individually. Our western Shandong pursuit force launched a fierce attack on the bandits' flanks from Chengwu to Caoxian and Kaocheng, killing more than 8,000 bandits. Together with the bandits killed near Lanfeng, Yejigang, Zhongmu, Baisha, and Shangcai, plus the bandits bombed by our air force in various places, and the bandits killed by us north and south of the Wanfu River, the total number reached more than 34,700 people. (Rumors that the air force bombed civilians have been investigated and found to be untrue. The air force has separately announced the true facts.) In the Kaifeng campaign, because the bandits adopted a human wave tactic, the number of bandits killed by our joint land and air forces, before and after, exceeded 15,000. Our losses during the same period, including local militias, were only 16,000 people, which is less than one-third of the bandit's casualties of more than 49,700 people.</p>
<p>Under the cooperation of the military and civilians in the defense of Kaifeng, communication was interrupted on the 22nd. On the evening of the 23rd, a portion of our defending troops and militias transferred to the northeast area of Kaifeng and made contact with the commando unit dispatched from Zhongmu. Seeing that our troops from all directions were about to encircle them, Chen Yi's 3rd, 8th, and 10th columns hurriedly collected vehicles, and the main force escorted the looted materials and fled south through Chichangzhen. Our vanguard entered the northern city of Kaifeng at 9:00 PM on the 25th. By 2:00 PM on the 26th, two of our divisions had been stationed in Kaifeng. At 4:15 PM, our western advance force also broke through the 10th column's rearguard, the bandit rearguard, after breaking through the bandit rearguard, in Xinglongji and reached Kaifeng. Thus, our armies from the east, west, and north officially joined forces in Kaifeng.</p>
<p>The bandits harassed Kaifeng city for four days, their main task being to loot materials and capture and kill civil servants. According to Wu Zheng, the artillery platoon leader of the 66th Division of the Kaifeng garrison, who escaped, the bandits drove more than 5,000 of our party, government, and military civil servants to the Yellow River beach, tricked them into waiting for boats, and collectively shot them. Wu Zheng was one of the lucky survivors. The bandit army's inhumanity reached this point, and they still make false propaganda to deceive the ignorant, but they cannot hide the facts in the end.</p>
<p>2. Eastern Henan Campaign: After the recovery of Kaifeng, our armies launched a full-scale suppression campaign against the bandit troops who had retreated to the Yellow River flooded area. From the 27th, we successively captured Chenliu, Suixian, and Qixian. On the 29th, in the area south of Suixian and east of Tongxu, the two sides are currently engaged in the fiercest battle. In the past three days, the bandits' Guangdong-Guangxi columns have been destroyed by us. The bandits' casualties have exceeded 20,000, and the National Army's losses are about 5,000. In addition, Liu's bandits' 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns, which had sneaked to the vicinity of Xuchang, also mostly fled north at night, passing Changge and Weichuan, seemingly to respond to Chen's bandits in Tongxu. The development of the war on this front is worthy of attention if the Chen and Liu bandits do not try to find gaps to escape the decisive battle as they have in the past.</p>
<p>(2) Situation in Eastern Hebei and Central Shandong: In addition to the Eastern Henan battlefield, the situation in eastern Hebei and central Shandong was also more important this week.</p>
<p>1. Eastern Hebei: The bandits Lin Biao's 11th column, Li Yunchang's 8th column, and Nie Rongzhen's 2nd and 4th columns, along with eight regiments belonging to the bandits' 3rd and 12th military sub-districts, totaling more than 60,000 people, launched attacks on our strongholds such as Beidaihe, Liushouying, Anshan, Shimen, Changli, and Leizhuang, west of Qinhuangdao and east of Guye on the section of the Beining Railway inside the pass, starting on the 24th. Anshan, Shimen, and Changli were once captured by the bandits. The bandits' purpose was to destroy the Beining Railway, but as of the 29th, all the above strongholds have been recovered by our army. Our eastern and western troops also joined forces in Changli and are continuing to pursue the bandits. We are actively repairing the railway that was destroyed by the bandits and will soon restore it to its original state.</p>
<p>2. Central Shandong: Since Chen's bandits' 7th and 8th columns, together with the 13th column, once again launched an attack on the outer defenses of Yanzhou, the bandits launched fierce attacks on our East Gate and West Gate from the 25th to the 27th, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the 28th, the situation eased as the bandits suffered heavy casualties, exceeding 8,000 people. On the evening of the 29th, the fighting started again. The bandits attacking the East and West Gates were repelled by our air force in coordination with the defending troops. At the moment, the city defense of Yanzhou is very solid. Although the bandits' 9th column in Mingshui is rushing south at night to reinforce, planning to take advantage of the fact that our reinforcements have not yet arrived to capture Yanzhou and make a long-term attempt to obstruct the Jinpu transportation, in fact, in the middle of this week, the bandits gained nothing except heavy sacrifices.</p>

<h3>Three Powers Resolve on Joint Action to Protest Soviet Blockade of Berlin Traffic: Note Drafted and Ready for Issuance Pending Approval by Diplomatic Authorities; Soviets Announce End of Four-Power Administration of Berlin</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] Well-informed official sources stated today that the United States, Britain, and France have drafted a joint note demanding that the Soviet Union lift the blockade of Berlin and restore four-power joint administration of the area. The note is ready for submission to Moscow once approved by US Secretary of State Marshall, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault, possibly later this week. The note was drafted by US Ambassador to Britain Douglas, French Ambassador to Britain Massigli, and British Foreign Office expert Strang. The three met for two hours today and finalized the wording. The content has not been officially announced, but it is understood that the Soviet Union will be responsible for anything that happens to the residents of West Berlin if the Berlin blockade is not lifted.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] It is understood that the United States, Britain, and France are preparing to lodge a serious protest with Moscow against the Soviet blockade of Berlin. Diplomats say that according to current plans, unless the Soviet Union suddenly changes its policy and orders the Soviet military commander on the border to reopen land traffic to Berlin, a direct request to the Kremlin cannot be prevented.</p>
<p>According to the most well-informed sources, the protest letter to Moscow will take the following form: First, it will require the Soviet Foreign Ministry to deal with the immediate abolition of traffic restrictions; second, if the Soviet government does not issue the above order, the three powers will not be responsible for the possible consequences; third, it will again ask the Soviet Union to agree to unify the economy of Berlin and all of Germany, although the above request has long been tried without result.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] The Soviet Union formally announced the end of four-power joint administration of Berlin today. Colonel Kalinin, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Command in Berlin, summoned the chiefs of staff of the Allied countries this afternoon to read a pre-prepared declaration announcing the end of four-power joint administration of Berlin. The declaration stated: "Colonel Howley's (US Commander in Berlin) notorious style, the lack of response from British and French representatives to protests from the Soviet authorities, and the Western Allied countries' unilateral implementation of currency reform in Berlin have made it impossible for the four-power meeting of the Berlin Joint Military Government to be held. Soviet representatives will no longer attend four-power meetings of the Berlin Joint Military Government." After the reading, the British Chief of Staff Osborne, the US Chief of Staff Bull, and the French Chief of Staff Dano inquired about the status of the Joint Military Government. Kalinin replied that Soviet representatives will no longer participate in any level of the Joint Military Government, but its technical employees will remain in the Joint Military Government for the time being to sort out documents. During the period when the Soviet technicians are sorting out the files, the Soviet flag will continue to be displayed alongside the flags of the other three powers, and a Soviet sentry will continue to be stationed at the entrance. Although the Joint Military Government has ended, its previous orders to Berlin will still be recognized by the Soviet side, as the Soviet side respects the four-power agreement, and these agreements and resolutions are still valid for the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>West German Premiers Accept Three Powers' Suggestions: Constitutional Assembly to Convene Before September to Draft New Constitution and Organize Autonomous Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] British Military Governor Robertson, US Military Governor Clay, and French Military Governor Koenig formally presented suggestions to the premiers of the eleven West German states today at the US Military Government headquarters here, instructing them to convene a constitutional assembly before the beginning of September to implement the plans related to the future of West Germany resolved by the London Six-Nation Conference. The content will enable the West German Federation to take over most of the internal responsibilities currently exercised by the three-power military government. The three powers' suggestions were drafted after the three military governors met overnight, charging the Germans with selecting administrative institutions with clearly defined powers and establishing an independent Supreme Court with the power to review federal legislation and resolve interstate disputes.</p>
<p>The suggestion stipulates that the new constitution drafted by the constitutional assembly should establish a bicameral federal parliament to exercise legislative power over administration and taxation. The legislative powers over education, religion, culture, and welfare will be exercised by the state parliaments, and the federal parliament will only be responsible for liaison and coordination. In his speech at the meeting, Clay emphasized the necessity of establishing the West German government as early as possible. He said that the Western occupying powers are well aware of the need for the West German constitutional assembly to be convened before the beginning of September. After the constitution is formulated, the work of organizing the West German government can move a step forward. In addition to reiterating the necessity of convening the constitutional assembly as soon as possible, Robertson also said that the London Conference decided that this constitutional assembly should, if possible, accommodate representatives from the eastern states. Although a series of events have recently occurred between the occupying powers, it would certainly still be a good thing if you could persuade your East German colleagues to participate in this great event.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] Today's meeting of the West German premiers lasted only an hour or so. French Commander-in-Chief Koenig also presented an occupation bill to the meeting, stipulating the relationship between the Allied occupation authorities and the new constitutional government of Germany. British Commander-in-Chief Robertson also asked several states to review their borders in order to adjust them according to traditional systems.</p>

Although Ambassador Smith is still here, according to reliable sources, he will also leave the Soviet Union before the end of the year. Smith had agreed to Truman's request to remain in office until after the US election. In addition, many senior embassy officials will be replaced soon. There have been many changes in recent months. In another month, there will be no more than a dozen familiar faces left here.</p>
<h3>Italian Socialist Party Congress Elects New Executive Committee; Further Decides on Future Path</h3>

<h3>Cominform Headquarters Moved to Bucharest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Reliable sources in Belgrade say that the headquarters of the nine-nation Cominform will be moved from Belgrade to Bucharest, the capital of Romania. The Cominform meeting that recently decided to expel Tito and the Yugoslav Communists from the Cominform was held in Bucharest. The Yugoslav ambassador to Czechoslovakia told them that the Cominform's criticism of the Yugoslav Communists was based on malicious information provided by Hebron and Shuzo, two people who had been expelled from the government and expelled from the party by the Yugoslav authorities.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Determined to Strengthen Its Strength to Safeguard National Independence and Freedom: Marshal Tito Enthusiastically Supported by the People</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yugoslavia, 30th] Marshal Tito visited a construction project in the capital city for two hours today, accompanied by several communist cadres and senior military officers. This was Tito's first appearance in two weeks. The mystery surrounding his disappearance has been swept away. The young workers at the site shouted "Long live!" to welcome him. Tito's appearance symbolizes that the Yugoslav Communists continue to back him and disregard the Cominform's accusations of his betrayal of the party.</p>
<p>On the surface, the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party continue to maintain a peaceful stance. The Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a second statement, announcing its intention to strengthen and continue to promote urgent cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Soviet satellite countries, but stressed that "the independence of the Yugoslav nation is a condition for moving towards socialism and its comprehensive progress" and demanded "comprehensive strengthening of the Yugoslav army to defend the nation's freedom and independence."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] Well-informed sources deny various rumors about the situation inside Yugoslavia, especially the news of conflicts occurring along the border. Foreigners are currently not allowed to enter the border area, but this agency's correspondent can prove that everything is peaceful in Belgrade.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Communists Condemn Bulgarian Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] Tito, the Yugoslav dictator, despite being surrounded by the Communist Party of Moscow and Eastern Europe, expanded his counterattack again on the 1st and attacked Bulgarian Premier Dimitrov, who is competing for leadership in the Balkans. Dimitrov is an old communist and a leader of the Third International. In January of this year, Dimitrov proposed a Balkan Federation. Once the Soviet Union objected, Dimitrov immediately admitted his mistake. In contrast, Tito believes that he has no special obligations to the Kremlin. His seizure of power is due to his merits in resisting Germany during the war. The Yugoslav Communist Party's newspaper "Borba" also published a fierce editorial defending Titoism and severely criticizing the Bulgarian Communists. However, 24 hours ago, the newspaper was still extending a hand of friendship to Bulgaria and proposing a Yugoslav-Bulgarian-Albanian federation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] Polish newspapers, in addition to supporting the Cominform's accusations against the Yugoslav Communists, have also created the new term "Titoism," which they define as "a doctrine with grand schemes characterized by megalomania, conceit, a lack of vision, and a lack of coordination."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 1st] The Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party (formed by the merger of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party) recently issued a declaration, stating its complete acceptance of the Cominform's resolution on the erroneous policies adopted by the Yugoslav Communists.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Federal System and Recognition of Israel Rejected by the Arab League; Demands for Bernadotte to Revise Peace Proposals</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 1st broadcast: The Political Committee of the Arab League informed reporters today that the committee has unanimously rejected the Palestine peace proposals put forward by the United Nations mediator, stating that the Arab side will formally respond on Saturday. At that time, a counter-proposal may be put forward.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 1st] The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, said here that if Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposals are not revised, the Arabs will have no choice but to reject them. The Arab League has now appointed a subcommittee to draft a response to the proposal. Azzam emphasized, "We will never accept a federal system, and we will never accept the establishment of Israel within Palestine."</p>
<p>The Arabs will propose several amendments to Bernadotte's proposal, and it remains to be seen whether Bernadotte will accept them. If the Arab views cannot be reconciled with the Jewish views, then the Arabs will have no choice but to reject them.

<h3>Despite Soviet Use of Violence and Intimidation, the Three Powers are Determined to Remain in Berlin; Foreign Secretary Bevin Elaborates on Policy Towards Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] The entire House of Commons greeted Foreign Secretary Bevin's solemn declaration that Britain will not yield in the Berlin crisis with great cheers. Previously, Conservative Deputy Leader Eden had called on the government to take a firm stance, saying that sometimes there is only one possible way to maintain peace, and now is the time to take a firm stand, and the Berlin incident is an event that must be approached firmly. The government should, together with other Western allies, solemnly inform the Soviet Union that it will not succumb to violence and intimidation.</p>
<p>In his reply, Bevin first detailed the course of the Berlin crisis. He said, "The Soviet Union, on the pretext of technical reasons, has successively prohibited traffic on highways, railways, inland waterways, and bridges. We have acknowledged its reasons and are willing to provide technical assistance and materials to help repair the bridges and railways. We cannot help but suspect the Soviet Union's motives in creating difficulties, whether they are truly technical issues and currency control issues, or whether there is another political purpose to force us to withdraw from Berlin. As far as technical issues are concerned, we are willing to provide assistance, even at the cost of providing repair materials that we ourselves lack, so that traffic can be restored as soon as possible. As far as currency control is concerned, it has long since become ineffective. Then its motive is to make our position in Berlin difficult and force us to withdraw. If the Soviet Union wants to use any means to create famine for 2.5 million people in West Berlin, thereby causing chaos and reaction, in order to put pressure on its wartime allies, then the British government will not succumb to it (cheers). I dare to believe that the United States and France hold similar views (cheers). We cannot abandon the democratic elements in Berlin who refuse to succumb to Soviet pressure. Countless Berlin citizens would rather endure any suffering than accept Soviet rule. These citizens deserve our full support. The steps we have taken in handling these events are all in close consultation with the governments of the United States and France. Representatives of Britain, the United States, and France hold meetings frequently as needed to address the situation. We have a full understanding of the task before us and the obstacles we will face. The British government has decided to use all available capabilities, and the United States has also taken similar measures to prevent the complete disruption of freight, so that the restrictions promulgated by the Soviet Union will lose their effectiveness. The United States government, like us, has confirmed that its position in Berlin is based on agreement, and its will to continue to stay in Berlin will never change. This morning, there were rumors that Sokolovsky had the intention to lift some restrictions. I do not intend to argue about Sokolovsky's words, but what we need now is action, not empty words. I have to solemnly declare that we all insist that Berlin should be governed on the basis of the Four Powers, and we are also ready to discuss the Berlin situation on the basis of the Four Powers at any time. At the same time, we must continue to carry out all our plans to cope with the situation. However, given the complexity and subtlety of the current situation, the British government must also proceed with caution and cannot take risks rashly." When talking about the general situation in Germany, Bevin said that the Soviet Union has consistently violated the Potsdam Agreement and undermined the possible reunification of Germany. In the past three years, the Soviet Union has obtained as much as 7 billion yuan in reparations from its occupied area, leaving Britain and the United States alone to bear the task of maintaining the survival of the Germans. Britain's assistance in Germany's reconstruction has exceeded 200 million pounds. The Potsdam Agreement stipulates the demilitarization of Germany, the elimination of Nazism, and the completion of democratization. In the Western sector, these initial goals have been achieved and are available for inspection at any time, but in the Soviet sector, it has always been shrouded in secrecy. Judging from the German newspapers controlled by the Soviet Union, the National Democratic Party is being organized in East Germany to absorb former Nazis. From a security point of view, the Western countries cannot help but feel extremely concerned about this.</p>
<h3>McNeil Concludes Debate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Minister of State McNeil, representing the government, expressed regret in the House of Commons today at the end of the debate on the German issue for some parties' alarmist rhetoric about the Berlin crisis. He said that the situation in Berlin has reached a serious level and cannot be exaggerated by rumors. Here he pointed out that the rumor that the Soviet Union has set up blocking balloons around Berlin is absolutely untrue. If this were the case, the Western powers would have to shoot them down, which would cause a real conflict. It is expected that the Soviet Union is not prepared to do so. McNeil then reiterated Foreign Secretary Bevin's words, stating that the Western powers will not yield and will continue to stay in Berlin, with or without balloons.</p>

<h3>City Council General Assembly Concludes Successfully; Speaker Delivers Speech Raising Awareness; Difficulties Ahead are Just Beginning; Should Stabilize the Military, Police, and Middle-Class Production</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Sixth Session of the First City Council General Assembly concluded successfully yesterday after holding its eighth meeting. This meeting, which opened on the 21st of last month, continued to be held, excluding Thursdays, with two extended days, for a total of ten days. More than 150 proposals were discussed, and most of them were successfully concluded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting began at 3:45 p.m. After the case of establishing a Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital was debated for an hour and passed, the discussion of the remaining proposals mostly went smoothly. By 7:50 p.m., all the agenda items had been discussed. Five minutes later, the adjournment ceremony was held.</p>
<p>The adjournment ceremony began with the melodious sounds of military music. After the Speaker led the formal ceremony, he took the stage to deliver the adjournment speech, stating that this meeting lasted a total of ten days, and all members carefully and enthusiastically discussed various proposals, achieving considerable conclusions, which is truly gratifying. He recalled that when the meeting opened on the 21st of last month, he mentioned the price fluctuations over the past three and a half months, but the price fluctuations during the ten days of the meeting were more drastic than in the past three and a half months. The central government is of course concerned about this, and the Executive Yuan and the relevant departments have reportedly drafted emergency measures to be implemented after being approved by the highest authorities. The municipal authorities also convened a temporary economic conference in the shortest possible time, deciding on four emergency measures to be implemented, which have achieved considerable results in recent days, and prices are gradually stabilizing. However, another factor in price stabilization is that the financial sector is currently in the midst of its settlement period, so the economic trends after the settlement period are also worthy of attention. Furthermore, the Northeast circulating notes may also flow to Shanghai after the Ping Municipal Council passed a resolution to temporarily suspend their exchange, and domestic remittances have recently been opened, and idle funds tend to flock to Shanghai. All of these factors deserve the increased awareness of the council members.</p>
<p>Next, he talked about public security. The economy is life, but public security is not only life, but also the very existence of being. If public security is not guaranteed, then one's life and property will eventually be unsecured. Therefore, to protect public security, all members should pay extreme attention to the lives of the military and police in Shanghai who are defending the city, and should do their best to ensure that they have no worries about food and clothing. In addition to maintaining public security, it is especially necessary to maintain the stability of the lives of the middle class. The council will never speak for the wealthy, but it cannot look down on the majority of the middle-class industry and commerce because it cannot stand the few wealthy individuals. Today, I am speaking for industry and commerce, not only for the investors of industry and commerce, but also for the entire staff who serve industry and commerce. If industry and commerce collapse, then how will the staff who serve the various industries and businesses solve their livelihoods? Therefore, speaking from Shanghai's point of view, our order of life is all due to the economic difficulties, and the difficulties ahead may be just beginning, so there should be a proper response plan. During this adjournment period, members should raise awareness, and the responsibilities of the members are significant. During the adjournment period, they should continue to work tirelessly and work together with the authorities to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Mayor Expresses Many Feelings; Puts Forward Two Points of View</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating that he was deeply moved by the Speaker's words and wanted to raise two points: (1) At this difficult time, everyone should have a common goal, which is to recognize that the communist bandits are everyone's enemy, and should not have any hope of surviving by seeking temporary peace. (2) The government and the people must have a spirit of mutual understanding and trust. At this point, he listed some thorny issues that were difficult to handle, but the results still failed to gain understanding from the outside world. (1) The price of rice distributed in July was set at 10 million yuan per dan after much effort, but it has been subjected to setbacks and accusations. (2) The adjustment of the prices of public utilities. The problem of the cost of living index. He finally pointed out that the current time is an extraordinary period, and everyone should understand and help each other, recognize the goal, contribute money or effort, and then the difficulties will not be difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Finally, City Councilor Shao Yongsheng gave a response, saying that the Speaker's words were earnest and sincere, and that the Mayor's achievements since taking office were remarkable, making him a great politician. He believed that democratic politics is a politics of criticism, with standards, scope, and a consistent public concept, and generally there will not be many errors except in very few cases. Therefore, members should study how to make suggestions to the government that meet the needs of truth.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday's meeting began at 3:45 p.m. To avoid the case of the Chinese Medicine Hospital taking too long to debate, it was postponed for discussion, and the other seven cases in the health section were first submitted for public discussion. As a result, all of them were passed in accordance with the examination opinions. Important cases included: (1) Please construct complete public restrooms near the North Railway Station. (2) Please have the Health Bureau pay attention to the sanitation of the Nanshi area, clear the streets, and ban privately built toilets. (3) To prevent epidemics, please strengthen sanitation work, etc.</p>
<p>There were a total of eight cases in the regulations section. The discussion of important cases proceeded as follows: (1) Proposed to send a telegram in the name of the General Assembly to the national representatives and legislators produced in this city, asking them to take the lead in opposing the unreasonable demands of a few public opinion representatives who disregard the livelihood of the people and demand personal treatment from the government. The examination opinion was reserved. During the discussion, three opinions were generated: amended and passed, re-submitted for examination, and passed according to the original case. The results of the vote showed that none of them could obtain a majority of the votes, so this case was declared invalid. (2) In response to the Thai government's destruction of overseas Chinese education, a motion was passed to submit a serious protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (3) A motion was passed to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Japanese fishing boats and crew seized this time be severely punished. (4) Proposed that the central government immediately replace the corrupt and incompetent officials in charge at all levels with energetic, intelligent, and honest new personnel to thoroughly reform politics. (5) A motion was passed to launch an anti-Soviet and aid bandit suppression campaign, present the secret agreement of the Chinese Communist Party selling out the country, and demand the recovery of Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>Budget Should be Frugal; Expand Business Expenses</p>
<p>There were only two cases in the budget section: (1) The city's budget should be frugally managed by the various agencies themselves to expand business expenses in order to promote municipal administration. It was resolved to be submitted to the municipal government for consideration. (2) The office expenses of the district people's representative meetings and the meal expenses of the district people's representatives attending the meetings were proposed to be increased. It was resolved to be submitted to the municipal government for appropriate increase.</p>
<p>In the section on retroactive recognition cases, there were 73 important cases of resolutions made by various committees during the recess period of the five general assemblies of the council, all of which were passed and retroactively recognized. After separately passing the acceptance of the examination of the municipal government's policy report and the report of the resolution review committee, a temporary recess was announced.</p>
<p>Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital; Motion to Add New Facility Passed</p>
<p>At 5:30 p.m., the meeting reconvened and the case of "Please add a Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital to meet social needs" was submitted for discussion. Those who expressed their opinions included Jing Zhou, Shi Zongde, Zhang Zhihan, Jiang Huaisu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shui Xiangyun, Ye Fenghu, Yang Fusheng, Yu Shun, Zhu Yakui, Yan Guodong, Qu Yue, Zhou Xiangsheng, Jiang Hao, Chen Baotai, Chen Cunren, Fan Shouyuan, and many others. Printed materials were distributed at the venue like snowflakes, and a petitioning group from the Nanjing Road Store Association appeared outside the venue, demanding the establishment of a Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital. The opinions of the city councilors varied, and many recounted their own experiences of being cured by Chinese medicine or Western medicine, making the scene very lively. At 6:15 p.m., the chairman announced the end of the discussion and summarized the opinions of the city councilors into four points, which were submitted for voting. Finally, with 75 votes (out of 139 councilors present), a majority vote was obtained to amend the reasons for the original case and pass it.</p>
<p>With this case resolved, the meeting seemed to be relieved of a heavy burden, and then proceeded to discuss the report submitted by the Public Utilities Investigation Committee. The Secretary-General reported the recommendations for various public utilities. The secretariat read out the conclusions of the report, and the chairman immediately submitted it for discussion, and two resolutions were passed: (1) Pass the acceptance of the report, (2) The Public Utilities Investigation Committee is approved to conclude immediately.</p>
<p>Temporary Motions</p>
<p>Finally, 32 temporary motions were submitted for discussion. Except for a few that were submitted for examination, most of them were passed. Noteworthy cases are as follows: (1) Send a telegram to the central government, urging it to negotiate with the Hong Kong government through diplomatic channels to stop the exchange of Hong Kong currency, and ask it to deny that Hong Kong currency outside and inside the territory has the same value, in order to alleviate our country's economic crisis. (2) Recommend that the central government improve the road administration of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines. (3) Please have the municipal government quickly allocate a suitable burial site so that Pushan Villa can continue to bury the deceased. (4) Prices have soared in recent days, and the five major department stores in the city often close early, which is close to hoarding and confusing the public. A motion was passed to ask the municipal government to issue an order to the industry association to instruct them to correct the situation in the name of the General Assembly. (5) Please have the municipal government fully assist the garrison headquarters in raising funds to establish an independent garrison brigade within a time limit to strengthen the local armed forces of the city. (6) Please have the municipal government's vehicle management department conduct a household survey to match the actual life of workers, and include the required expenses in this year's municipal budget. (7) Please have the municipal government strive to ensure that the actual use of educational funds in this city is in line with the proportion of the budget and final accounts, in order to emphasize education. (8) Thoroughly investigate and severely punish the major case of Hu Xinyi melting and selling gold bars.</p>
<h3>Air-Conditioned Train to Begin Operation on the 15th</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Most of the "air-conditioned trains" of the Jinghu Railway Bureau have been assembled, and they will definitely be able to join the Jinghu line on the 15th of this month as scheduled. However, the traffic density of the Jinghu line has reached saturation, so the addition of air-conditioned trains must stop the operation of one of the original passenger trains. It is reported that the Railway Bureau intends to stop the operation of the Triumph Express and replace it with an air-conditioned train. The driving speed will also be shortened to five hours for the entire Jinghu journey, restoring the speed of the pre-war express train. It will depart from the North Shanghai Station at 7:00 a.m. every morning and arrive in Nanjing at 12:30 p.m. It will depart from Nanjing Station at 6:00 p.m. and arrive in Shanghai at 11:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>First-Run Movies Raise Prices Again; All Ticket Prices Increase by 100,000 Yuan; Suspension of Western Film Supply Results in Stalemate; Cinema Industry Demands Termination of Contracts</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The stalemate between the cinema industry association and the Western film merchants association caused by the suspension of new film supply problem has not been resolved as of last night. According to the cinema industry association, this time the association resolutely demanded compensation for losses and termination of contracts from the Western film merchants. Although the various cinemas themselves know that they are at a disadvantage, in order to express their position and point out who is ultimately responsible for this matter, they have decided to insist on the resolution without compromise, and are prepared to break off relations completely. As for the first-run cinemas showing Western films, in order to adapt to the increase in the cost of living index, they have decided to adjust ticket prices starting today to a minimum price of 200,000 yuan, with the remaining levels increasing by 100,000 yuan, becoming four levels of 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, and 600,000. However, the cinema industry association has formally denied the rumor that this price increase is to approach the ideal conditions of Western film merchants in order to leave room for negotiation with each other. The association stated that the various cinemas can still maintain operations by showing old films. If box office sales gradually decline, they will immediately switch to showing domestic films. They hope that domestic film manufacturers can seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work hard on production and exercise caution in making films in order to replace the deep-rooted position of Western films in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Petitioners Striking Property Tax; Representatives of Industry and Commerce Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Report Petition Process Successful</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association held its fourth standing committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than ten people, including Du Yuesheng, Hu Boxiang, and Xu Xueyu, attended. Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, and Yang Liren, the representatives of industry and commerce who went to Beijing to petition on the property tax issue, also rushed back to participate and immediately reported the process of petitioning and striking property tax.

It is hoped that the industrial and commercial circles of the city will continue their efforts and will definitely achieve final victory. The petition representatives are scheduled to go to Beijing again this weekend to continue the petition. The meeting also decided to hold a tea party at the City Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 p.m. today, jointly convened by the City Chamber of Commerce and the preparatory committee of the Industrial Association, to report on the petition process of the 12 representatives of industry and commerce who went to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Domestic Airline Ticket Prices Adjusted Today, Ranging from 100% to 180% Increase</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Effective today, domestic airline ticket prices will be adjusted with increases ranging from 100% to 180%. The Shanghai-Beijing route will only increase by 100%; the Beijing-Shenyang and Beijing-Taiyuan routes by 120%; the Shanghai-Lanzhou and Shanghai-Kunming routes by 140%; and the Southern China and Hong Kong routes will have the highest increase at 180%. Ordinary cargo and excess baggage, previously charged at 1% of the ticket price per kilogram, will now be charged at 2% of the ticket price. Valuables will be charged at 5% of the ticket price per kilogram, mail and letters at 1% of the ticket price, parcels at 2%, and newspapers will continue to be charged at 60% of the postal rate.</p>
<p>Striving to Maintain Transportation</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC): The Ministry of Transportation's approved increase is far from the company's request for a general increase of 189%. Furthermore, fuel prices, exchange rates, and the cost of living have increased since July 1st. Using February 7th as a base, the cost of living as of July 1st has risen by 646%, gasoline by 2460%, and exchange rates by 1750%. According to the cost calculation formula, current ticket prices should be 1595% higher than on February 7th, but the cumulative approved increases have only reached 750%. Under these circumstances, the airline, in order to reduce losses and ensure its survival, is considering reducing the number of flights. More flights mean greater losses, while fewer flights can reduce losses. However, even with reduced flights, the airline will strive to maintain air transportation to cities of political and economic importance.</p>
<p>Compilation of Fares for Various Routes</p>
<p>The adjusted fares from Shanghai to various destinations are listed below: (1) Twin-engine aircraft: To Nanjing 5.2 million yuan, to Qingdao 28 million yuan, to Jinan 40.8 million yuan, to Beijing 55 million yuan, to Zhengzhou 47.9 million yuan, to Xi'an 78.8 million yuan, to Lanzhou 105.4 million yuan, to Dihua 202.4 million yuan, to Jiujiang 27.5 million yuan, to Hankou 37.8 million yuan, to Chongqing 73.1 million yuan, to Hengyang 61.7 million yuan, to Guilin 80.7 million yuan, to Kunming 107.1 million yuan, to Guangzhou 75.1 million yuan, to Hong Kong 90 million yuan, to Fuzhou 32.5 million yuan, to Xiamen 47.1 million yuan, to Shantou 59.4 million yuan, to Taipei 55.5 million yuan, to Manila 158.8 million yuan. (2) Skymaster aircraft: To Hong Kong 144 million yuan, to Qingdao 42 million yuan, to Beijing 82.5 million yuan, to Chongqing 109.7 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Salary Dispute at Department Stores: Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate Within Days; Management Expresses Determination Not to Disappoint Employees</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ten major department stores in the city, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The China Emporium, Lihua, Lian'an Zhonghua, Huaxin, and Taichang (collectively known as "Global Department Stores"), are experiencing heightened tensions due to employees demanding that management fulfill their contracts and implement annual salary increases. Fortunately, the situation has not escalated due to the vigorous efforts of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Department Store Workers' Union. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to conduct mediation within the next few days.</p>
<p>After negotiations between labor and management broke down on salary increases the day before yesterday, the Workers' Union, in addition to making vigorous appeals, also requested the Social Affairs Bureau to promptly mediate the matter. Yesterday morning, Xiao Zongjun, the general manager of the Sun Sun Company and representative of the Management Association, visited Zhao Banfu, the Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to explain the difficulties faced by the companies and expressed that he would immediately discuss remedial measures with the persons in charge of each company so as not to disappoint all the employees.</p>
<p>The China Emporium Closed for One Day</p>
<p>The management of The China Emporium claimed that their business was slower than other companies, so they could not consider the annual salary increase. The company's employees held a group leader meeting the night before last to discuss the matter, and as a result, decided to suspend the inventory count scheduled for the end of the sixth month (held every six months) and sell goods at low prices to show their resistance. Upon hearing the news, the company, in order to avoid losses, closed the business yesterday morning and convened a board meeting to discuss countermeasures. After the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to make vigorous appeals, the employees agreed to cancel the original plan and wait for a resolution. It was originally scheduled to reopen in the afternoon, but because all the employees continued to hold a meeting in the afternoon, the company was closed for one day yesterday. It is expected that business will resume as usual today.</p>
<p>Accident Narrowly Averted at the Sun Sun Company</p>
<p>The employees of the Sun Sun Company had a more aggressive attitude and requested to negotiate with the company management alone. In addition to an annual salary increase of ten yuan, the employees, upon hearing that the department heads of various departments had recently received a 50% salary increase, also requested an additional one yuan increase per year of service. However, after General Manager Xiao of the company persuaded them, the employees voluntarily abandoned the additional request and no longer insisted on direct negotiations, so it is hoped that no accidents will occur.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Workers' Cost of Living Index: Why is it Lower Than the Commodity Price Index? The Municipal Government Explains the Differences to Dispel Public Doubts</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The public has expressed dissatisfaction that the workers' cost of living index compiled by the Municipal Government's Statistics Department has not risen as much as the wholesale commodity price index compiled by various parties. There are also doubts as to why the workers' cost of living index is even lower than the cost of living index for civil servants in the Beijing-Shanghai area published by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The Municipal Government has now explained the true facts as follows: (A) Reasons why the workers' cost of living index is lower than the wholesale commodity price index: (1) The purpose of compiling the workers' cost of living index is to measure the multiple by which the workers' cost of living has increased compared to the base period. Therefore, it is based on the family budget survey of workers. Items that are not essential for daily life are not included in the selection. The wholesale commodity price index covers a very wide range of goods. Therefore, the contents of the two indexes are quite different.</p>
<p>Rationed Prices Far Lower Than Market Prices</p>
<p>Currently, foreign exchange rates are soaring. The prices of goods related to exchange rates and construction have risen significantly. For example, according to the index for the fourth week of June published by the China Economic Research Institute last week, the multiples by which the prices of chemicals, metals, and building materials have risen are very considerable, which has an irrepressible impact on the overall wholesale commodity price index. The prices of rent, electricity, water, public buses, and trams, which are necessities for workers, are greatly different from the general price increase due to the influence of government-approved standards. Furthermore, the prices of necessities that are subject to rationing, such as rationed rice, oil, and sugar, are far lower than market prices, which also has a significant impact on the relatively low workers' cost of living index. (2) The workers' cost of living index compiled by the Municipal Government is calculated based on the average price of goods for the entire month, while the wholesale commodity price index often includes weekly and daily indexes. Monthly indexes are very different from weekly and daily indexes.</p>
<p>Reasons for Differences with Civil Servants</p>
<p>(B) Differences between the workers' cost of living index and the civil servants' cost of living index: (1) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index is compiled based on the results of the family budget survey of workers and is only applicable in Shanghai. The civil servants' cost of living index for various parts of the country includes 29 major items required for exchange of living needs and is applicable throughout the country. (2) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index applies to the Shanghai area, while the civil servants' cost of living index for the Beijing-Shanghai area applies to a very wide area, so the two cannot be compared. (3) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index is compiled and applied in the current month. The civil servants' cost of living index for the Beijing-Shanghai area is based on the previous month's index to determine the payment benefits for the current month. The former is much higher than the latter. For example, the workers' cost of living index for June is 710,000 times, while the civil servants' cost of living index is 420,000 times. (4) The base period for the Shanghai workers' cost of living index is the 25th year, while the base period for the civil servants' cost of living index is the first half of the 26th year. (5) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index uses the total consumption value of the base period in Shanghai as the standard for calculating the index, while the special treatment of civil servants in various places uses the total consumption value of the base period in Nanjing as the standard for calculating the index.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Bodies Unearthed at the Site of the Shanghai Military Camp Fire: Coroner to Investigate This Morning; Recovered Gold Jewelry Sealed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A major fire occurred at the Ximing Lane of Miaohang Road in the Shanghai military camp the night before last, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. It is reported that the fire starter's real name is Sou Dongsheng. As of noon yesterday, a total of fourteen bodies, including humans and livestock, had been recovered. These include Sou Dongsheng, Sou's wife Qin Rongying, eldest son Jinquan, eldest daughter-in-law Shen Aimei, second son Jinquan, second daughter-in-law Qin Liuqing, nephew Runxing, granddaughter Lifen, and the tenants of the pavilion room Tan Lisuofen, daughter Aiqun, a baby who had been born for several days, and Zhang Chen Sanmei, a young woman from Guangdong who had only been in Shanghai for less than a month with Tan, and son Kangnian, as well as a large cat. Yesterday's report that Tan Jizhi, who worked on a landing craft, also died tragically in the fire has been found to be inaccurate. This morning, Zhang Guoxing (who works on the Minjiang landing craft of the Minsheng Company), a relative of Tan, rushed to the fire site after reading the newspaper and said that Tan was still in another city. The work of excavating the bodies yesterday was supervised by Xi Zhenru, the director of the Southern District Fire Brigade, who worked with the fire brigade and police officers to move the rubble. The bodies were all charred beyond recognition. Among them, the young woman Tan Lisuofen was still holding her baby in her arms, which was especially tragic. All the bodies have been transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall on Xinqiao Street, and a coroner will be requested to investigate this morning. Twelve gold rings, six gold bracelets, two silver bracelets, one watch, seven Hong Kong dollars, one silver dollar, a string of small pearls, two Fourth Bank Trust Department passbooks, a deposit slip (totaling one million yuan), and over one million yuan in legal tender (which had been burned) were recovered at the fire site. After the district chief, the fire brigade personnel of the Southern District, and the police officers inspected them on the spot, they were sealed and submitted to the case. It is also reported that, in addition to the back door being closed and nailed at ordinary times, the upstairs drying platform was also densely covered with lead wire mesh over a meter high, presumably to prevent thieves from stealing oilcloth, but unexpectedly this caused a major disaster.</p>
<h3>First Maritime Day: Commemoration Methods Planned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Tomorrow (the 3rd) is China's first Maritime Day. The National Federation of Shipping Associations of the Republic of China has specially formulated commemorative measures. In addition to posting slogans and holding commemorative meetings, Du Yong, the chairman of the association, has sent a letter to all ships anchored in ports across the country, requesting that they all sound their sirens for one minute at twelve o'clock noon.

<h3>Postal Boats Forced to Suspend Service: Hoping for Rationed Gasoline</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The postal boats Hongjun, Hongxin, and Post No. 3, which are used by the post office to transport mail, have recently been forced to suspend service one after another due to a lack of gasoline and diesel and difficulties in purchasing them. Currently, only the Hongju, which has the smallest carrying capacity, is barely operating. Although the postal authorities have actively tried to find a solution, they have not been effective. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the speed of mail delivery. The bureau is deeply worried and hopes that the relevant fuel authorities can provide gasoline rations so that the Hongjun and other postal boats can resume service and maintain the previous performance of mail delivery.</p>
<h3>Director Yu Sends Letter to Various Colleges</h3>

<h3>District Chief of Jing'an Temple District and Others Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jin Dehuan, the district chief of the Jing'an Temple District, and Wang Shuqing, the director of the economic section of the district office, and assistants Shen Yi and Wu Shijun, have recently been sued by Jin Shuqin and Zhang Yitang to the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing them of colluding to withhold household registration and rice rations and committing fraud. The indictment states that the rice coupons that should have been issued in the district in June, from numbers 172645 to 173454, were originally intended to be issued to foreign nationals in the district under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau, but were deliberately withheld by the district office and secretly distributed to residents of the seventh pao in the district. The district office also deliberately withheld 810 rice coupons that should have been allocated to the pao. Moreover, according to regulations, the district office should have completed and reported the rice coupons for the period by the 5th, but the district office also failed to comply with the deadline. The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled a hearing on the case for the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Street Vendor Arrested for Buying Silver Dollars</h3>

<h3>Public Utility Companies in This City Complain to the Public Utilities Bureau: Soaring Prices, Increased Expenses, and Greater Losses; Request to Adjust This Month's Prices Earlier</h3>
<p>Public utility companies in this city have complained to the Public Utilities Bureau that the rising prices in June have caused a sudden increase in expenses and greater losses. The Shanghai Electric Power Company reportedly suffered losses of as much as 800 billion yuan in mid-January. The day before yesterday, the persons in charge of various companies went to the Public Utilities Bureau to meet with Director Zhao, to explain their difficulties and request that measures be taken to maintain operations. It is reported that the companies hope that the price adjustments for July can be approved quickly and implemented earlier. In the past, the monthly adjustment date for water, electricity, and gas was usually delayed until the 10th, and for trams, buses, small trains, and ferries until the 15th. Moreover, since the additional measures were cancelled, the losses have been even greater. When calculating the new prices according to the automatic adjustment formula, there are further 20% to 30% discounts. The companies feel that they cannot sustain the monthly subsidies. Moreover, the price increases for public utilities in July are bound to be fierce, because the cost of living index has already increased by 110%, and it is reported that the metal index will increase by three times, the rationed coal will increase by more than one time, and other foreign exchange, fuel oil, and other items have also increased significantly.</p>

<h3>The Largest Black Market for US Dollars: The Deepest Loophole: Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi of this newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Qingdao on the 28th] Qingdao has become the largest black market for US dollars and the deepest loophole in the country. There are a large number of Americans, about five to six thousand. American officials travel back and forth more frequently than Chinese officials. The lives of Americans and Chinese are two completely opposite curves. Thus, a dangerous sense of superiority is growing on the edge of China's coast, completing and reaching various conclusions.</p>
<p>China in June is submerged in a rising tide. The black market for US dollars is rising higher and higher, and the value of "foreigners" is becoming more and more prominent. Just like welcoming Lepke, the black market suddenly jumped over three million. A small civil servant's monthly salary is only worth five US dollars, while an American private's income is 80 to 90 dollars. A captain has a Western-style house to live in. Now, Americans usually call Chinese people "Gawk," meaning "stupid bird." Calling them "Chinese" can be considered polite. Whether Chinese people are "Gawks" is evidenced by the five or six thousand "foreigners" living in Qingdao.</p>
<p>Taipingjiao is the soul of Qingdao in terms of geography and is now full of exotic atmosphere. More than 400 American military families, totaling less than 2,000 people, are still arriving. They are not registered in Chinese police stations. They are part of the US military, enjoy rations from the Port Service Department, and have their own schools. Chinese industries are being bought one after another, and the laying of oil pipelines and small railways does not stimulate much concern. Qingdao Airport is in the hands of Clement and is being expanded by the US 66th Aviation Engineering Team. The project was completed in mid-July of the 35th year of the Republic, fully completed last January, and several buildings have been added this year. Bricks and wood are being continuously transported from the port to the airport.</p>
<p>The need for housing is becoming more and more serious. Rent is as high as 50 yuan per room. Chinese people with real estate rely on this for a living. The US side has asked the Chinese government to suppress rent, but such negotiations will not yield results. Another negotiation involves venereal diseases. At dusk, American soldiers crowd the eighty-odd bars. When military doctors find that soldiers have contracted venereal diseases, they constantly provide the names of those "bar owners" to the Chinese government for negotiation. But there is a difficulty in between. The number of "bar owners" who are truly registered is only a hundred and twenty. Most of them come through smuggling, at least over a thousand.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate them. They are earning foreign exchange for the government. Now, Qingdao has become the largest black market for US dollars in China. It is estimated that at least 300,000 US dollars flow into the black market every month. Calculated at black market prices, this is about 800 billion legal tender, equivalent to two hundredths of the total current currency issuance in China. General speculators travel between Ping and Shanghai to traffic, and there are no fewer than a thousand small vendors who directly engage in the black market to seek small profits. Sometimes they even make the price higher than in Beijing and Shanghai. The government has never been able to prohibit the US military from using US dollars in the market, but when a rickshaw puller or vendor has a few dollars, they are arrested in the name of cracking down on the black market. Nothing is more contradictory than this.</p>
<p>There are several sources of US dollars: the US military and their families use it directly in the market, including exchanging it for black market legal tender. The salaries of 300 Chinese employees and 100-odd foreign employees, rent from private properties. The wages of 1,400 Chinese workers are paid in legal tender. The original wages of each person are calculated in US dollars, but the legal tender issued is higher than the official exchange rate but lower than the black market rate. Some of the sources of this legal tender are the black market. The Economic Emergency Measures Plan is completely ineffective here. The US side needs legal tender in several places and mostly remits it from Shanghai, but the central bank here has not seen any of these 300,000 bills. Unless the so-called "US dollar criminals" are caught and taken to the central bank to exchange them for a pitiful few yuan at the official exchange rate.</p>
<p>The loopholes are extremely large. The global shortage of US dollars and the global black market are reflected so strongly in Qingdao. A major brought six cars to Qingdao last year, earned 30,000 yuan, and then took back carpets from Beiping, earning 60,000 yuan out of thin air. He then retired and went to tour Europe. In April last year, a flood of goods poured in, especially cars. After the news of Kirk selling cars was published in the Shanghai newspapers, the Chinese customs also cried out. The US government restricts soldiers from bringing new cars out of the country, only allowing cars that have been used for more than half a year to be taken out, and they can only be sold after two years. There are still vehicles on the streets of Qingdao today that still have California or Virginia license plates, but these are already the private property of Chinese people. Sanlu Road has become a famous "US Military Market" and is still full of American goods. Citizens have changed the original name of the road in their speech. Black market needs, US dollars, inflation, and special transportation are intertwined to form a beautiful speculative picture. Cornell, a New York car dealer, was the head of the press office of the Fleet Command. After retiring last August, he still lives in Qingdao but often does business in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and even Xinjiang. Some military doctors set up private hospitals after retiring, and the medicine does not have to go through customs.</p>

<h3>Songjiang Wife-Killing Case</h3>
<p>Husband Lan Futing, seeing that the crime was exposed, immediately committed suicide with a knife and fainted to the ground</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Songjiang on the 30th] Lan Futing, a Jiangxi native residing at 85 Cangcheng Street, worked as a wonton seller and lived with his wife, Ms. Xu. On the morning of the 29th, Qian Wang, who lived in the same house, discovered that Ms. Xu had been killed and was lying in a pool of blood. Her husband, Lan Futing, seeing that the crime was exposed, immediately committed suicide with a knife, fainted, and fell to the ground. After reporting to the Dacangqiao Police Station for an inspection, the injured Lan Futing was sent to a public hospital for emergency treatment. Because the injuries were very serious and he had lost too much blood, he was unable to speak and was reported to the Procuratorate for investigation. Ms. Xu's head had been cut four times, and her skull was broken. It was confirmed that she had been killed before death. As for why Lan Futing brutally killed his wife, it must wait for Lan Futing's injuries to heal slightly before he can confess. However, according to rumors from nearby, it is said that Ms. Xu had an affair and was caught by her husband, leading to the tragedy. - This newspaper reporter</p>
<h3>Jin Shaoshan's Predicament</h3>
<p>— Hong Zhenglun, Reporter for this Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Beiping on the 27th] Jin Shaoshan can be said to be from a "Liyuan (Peking Opera) family." His ancestors were famous in Beijing for playing Dahe Palace plays—that is, puppet shows, about three feet tall, called "Tuo Houren," which were no different from real people. The formal group that performed opera started with Shaoshan's father, Jin Xiushan. The first group he formed was in partnership with Yang Xiangcui, called Bao Shenghe. The second group he formed was with the famous Xiaosheng (young male role) De Junru, called Songzhushe, which performed at Jixiang. Shaoshan was born and trained in the class organized by his father, so it can be said that he came from a family tradition.</p>
<p>Six Months of Serious Illness After the Jixiang Theater was burned down, Shaoshan went from Ping to Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and then to Shanghai. From then on, he became popular throughout Jiangnan and rose rapidly.</p>
<p>Shaoshan returned to Ping during the ten years when war raged everywhere and the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders shattered North China. He fell ill in the winter of the 36th year of the Republic, and it has been more than seven months now. He has also encountered rampant banditry and soaring prices. The "Golden Overlord" has tasted it all.</p>
<p>The disease he is suffering from is peripheral neuritis. In today's era of advanced medicine, this is not considered an incurable disease. As long as he takes medicine in time and receives proper care, he can quickly recover his health.</p>
<p>Sudden Change of Heart When Shaoshan's illness was severe, a group of old friends advocated moving him to Zhonghe Hospital for treatment. Jin Shaoshan also agreed. However, when the 20 million yuan for hospitalization was delivered to the Jin residence, the Golden Overlord suddenly changed his mind. As a result, he is still lying in his own dark ward. The Golden Overlord's reason is: he will die in the main room, and he will never be thrown into a hospital. Until today, if the Golden Overlord does not change his stubborn opinion, he will really only have to wait for death. According to Mr. Zhou, who is taking care of Jin Shaoshan's illness, now that both Chinese and Western medicine are helpless, he was introduced by his old friend Luo Jiulian to a monk, who is now treating him. But it is unknown whether this otherworldly immortal can bring him an elixir from the sea.)</p>
<p>Family Burden Jin Shaoshan's family burden is quite heavy. In addition to two or three partners who live with him, he has two wives: the elder wife, Ms. Yang, is 51 years old, and the second wife, Ms. Li, named Zhuqing, is 29 years old. He has two sons: the eldest son, Dasheng, is 13 years old, and the second son, Miaozi, is 5 years old. He has two daughters: the eldest daughter, Daling, is 10 years old, and the second daughter, Erling, is 9 years old. The second son and the second daughter are both in elementary school. The eldest son, Dasheng, is said to be mentally unsound and is locked at home.</p>
<p>The Age Ending in "Nine" is a Hurdle When this reporter visited him, just as he was talking to him, he suddenly saw a 13- or 14-year-old boy with an iron chain hanging around his neck, with a wooden block attached to it, like a mad dog being locked up. The reporter asked what this was. After a long time, he murmured, "This is Dasheng! Because he is too naughty, we treat him like this." When I saw this, I couldn't help but feel sad. I think there might be a small tragedy behind this! The Golden Overlord is 59 years old this year. According to Mr. Zhou, an age ending in "nine" is a hurdle. I don't know if the Overlord can overcome this hurdle?</p>

<h3>Guo Tianci Extorted Money and Was Caught in Cheng</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Jiangyin on the 30th] Guo Tianci, a native of Taixing, using the title of president of the Jianguo News Agency and liaison officer of the Capital Garrison Command stationed in Cheng, detained Yin Dashou's ash-fertilizer boat at Beiwaizha Bridge on May 21, claiming that the boat was carrying gold bars and other items, and extorted 400 million yuan or two gold bars. After more than a month of investigation by the Beijing-Shanghai River Defense Command, the entire case was solved on June 28. The main culprit, Guo Tianyang, and the accomplice, Wang Guoqing, were arrested outside Beimen and taken to headquarters for interrogation. The Guo confessed to falsely using the name of the Garrison Command. The River Defense Department sent personnel to escort Guo and Wang to the Capital Garrison Command for legal action on the morning of the 29th.</p>
<h3>Salt Farmers in Songfeng Strike</h3>
<p>One day of shutdown results in a loss of 5 billion</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Fengxian on the 29th] The salt farmers in Songjiang and Fengxian counties along the coast under the jurisdiction of Yuanpu Farm, unable to withstand the pressure of high prices in recent days, suddenly sealed all the salt pans and went on strike on the 27th of this month. It is reported that in the past, ten dan of salt could be exchanged for one shi of rice, but now the price of rice has reached 20 million yuan per shi, while the price of salt is only 800,000 yuan per zu after deductions. Although the authorities of Zhaolin and Nanqiao Yuanpu Farm have tried to persuade them to resume work, and urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office, requesting an increase in the farm price, it takes time for official documents to travel back and forth. Therefore, the salt farmers are painfully stopping production and refusing to resume work until they receive a satisfactory response. However, the salt workers in both farms are in the season of sunny weather and high production. The daily output is about 3,000 dan. If calculated at the current market price of 1.7 million yuan per zu, the loss of one day's shutdown has reached more than 5 billion yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Illegal Intelligence Agency in Changzhou Recruits Troops and Collects Money Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>More than 20 key criminals were all arrested</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Wujin on the 30th] Recently, there have been many military, police, and political agencies in Changyi County, and the external organizations of various units are also quite complex. According to some statistics, there are no fewer than ten intelligence groups. Recently, an intelligence group, hosted by Jiang Zhengyi, openly used false names to recruit troops. Each new member was given a title and charged 20 to 30 million yuan, and a certificate was issued for a fee of 5 to 6 million yuan. The group's location was at 11 Xiaohuo Lane in the city. The case was cracked by the authorities, and the main culprit, Jiang Zhengyi, was transferred to the provincial authorities for legal action. The remaining key criminals, Liu Rong, Wang Zhiliang, and more than 20 others, were sent to the county for interrogation. During the preliminary hearing in the County Military Law Office on the 28th, Shao Guojing, a minor offender who was deceived into taking on clerical work through introductions, was released on bail. The others were returned to custody. At the same time, a con artist, Lu Jianqing, was arrested. He was also the leader of the group and falsely recruited members, collecting money in various ways. Many people were deceived.</p>

<h3>After the Publication of the Cost of Living Index, Retail Prices Have a New Look</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the city's commodity and securities markets had no formal transactions due to the semi-annual settlement of the silver and money industry, but there were still off-market transactions. Due to the closure of the customs, the money supply was extremely tight, and the black market interest rate was as high as four jiao or more, and prices showed a downward trend. The cost of living index published yesterday showed an unprecedented increase, and on the day of wage payment, various public and private institutions withdrew cash from banks, estimated to be over 1 trillion yuan in total. The tightness of the money supply is the main reason for this. Due to the shortage of funds in the market, prices showed a slight decline. Yesterday morning, the selling price of top-quality white rice was over 19 million yuan per dan, a drop of 20% from the peak. However, in terms of general daily necessities, merchants have adjusted retail prices due to the increase in the cost of living index, and food prices have increased significantly. Pork jumped from 420,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan per catty in one day. The prices of other daily necessities such as oil and charcoal have all taken on a new look, and the lives of ordinary people are becoming increasingly threatened. As for the general prices after the reopening of customs, those familiar with the business situation believe that stability is unlikely unless the authorities strictly control them in advance.</p>
<h3>Fuel Weights Adjusted Again, Kerosene at 13 Million Yuan per Can, Coal Briquettes at 1.9 Million Yuan per Load</h3>

Representatives from the Fuel Management Committee, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, the Fuel and Charcoal Industry Association, the Oil and Grease Industry Association, and the Kerosene Industry Association, among others, attended. The meeting was chaired by Section Chief Zhang of the Price Control Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The following price adjustments were decided: (1) Kerosene at 118 million yuan per 53-gallon barrel, 13 million yuan per 5-gallon can, and 340,000 yuan per pot, an increase of about 60% from the previous adjustment. (2) Coal briquettes at 32 million yuan per ton from the factory and 1.9 million yuan per load for retail, an increase of about 72% from the previous adjustment. The adjustments will take effect immediately.</p>
<h3>Three Yarn Mills in Violation of Regulations Have Their Membership Revoked</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee previously conducted the eleventh general survey of yarn mills in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and found that 17 companies, including Huacheng, were suspected of violating regulations. After review by the Committee, excluding Hengfeng, which was involved in a gold bill case and whose books and personnel were handled by the police bureau, the remaining 16 cases were deemed not worthy of further investigation: Dafeng, Wu Xiji, Yisheng, Shengfengfu, Shenyuan, Changfeng Company, Dingdaxieji, Wanfengchang, Huazhong, Huzi Ji, Xintaichang, Hengchangxiang, and Fudachang. Huacheng, Quanfeng, and Jichang were subject to the penalty of revoking their membership in the Yarn Industry Association. It is reported that the Committee has sent a list of the above-mentioned handling to the police bureau for reference.</p>
<h3>There are Still Three Difficulties in the Export of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the National Products Joint Operation Company: The recent export of yarn and cloth has not yet shown signs of improvement. The reasons are threefold: (1) The international market price is weak and there are many inventories. (2) The price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate is still far from the black market price, so smuggling has not been reduced, and the profits are higher than legitimate exports. (3) The export costs have increased sharply, making it difficult to circulate funds, and the packaging loans have not been relaxed. Under these three circumstances, it is difficult to be optimistic about the export of yarn and cloth in the short term.</p>
<p>The issue of reorganizing the Yarn Control Committee is still under consideration, and it is said that it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Before the legislative process is completed, the status quo will be maintained. Because the Committee's current business is simple, internal plans are to downsize, and more than half of the staff will be laid off. As for whether the Committee will still be under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after the reorganization, or be transferred to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, it has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee previously allocated 3,000 bales of Indian cotton to the Tianjin office of the Committee for distribution to meet the needs of local textile mills. Two thousand bales of the Indian cotton have arrived in Tianjin. The Tianjin Three District Cotton Textile Association sent a telegram to the Yarn Control Committee yesterday, requesting that the remaining 1,000 bales be shipped north as soon as possible to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Abundant Domestic Production of Caustic Soda: Imports Should Be Stopped Urgently</h3>
<p>Regarding caustic soda not being included in the list of items for which imports have been stopped, the Tianjin Chemical Plant under the Resources Committee states: The main products of the electrolytic plant are caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and bleaching powder. It is quite perplexing that only caustic soda imports have not been stopped. Currently, the Taiwan Alkali Company has over a thousand barrels of alkali stored in Shanghai, with no way to sell them. The Shenyang Chemical Plant has also imported several hundred barrels. The Tianjin Chemical Plant also has six to seven hundred barrels stored in Shanghai and Tianjin. This sufficiently proves that domestic caustic soda production is already very abundant.</p>
<h3>June Oil Quotas Approved by the Import/Export Control Committee</h3>
<p>The quotas for diesel, fuel oil, and gasoline for June have been approved by the Quota Allocation Department of the Import/Export Control Committee, with the following amounts: (1) Diesel and fuel oil: $2,702,471.21; (2) Gasoline: $1,296,505.68, of which automotive gasoline is $690,462.36 and aviation gasoline is $606,043.32. The total for diesel and gasoline is $4,998,976.89.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Prices Decline Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was slightly quieter due to trading houses closing for settlement and tight credit. However, upon opening, the "Ten Great British Cigarettes" showed a bullish trend, with strong demand from retailers. The closing price in the morning soared to 545 million yuan. In the afternoon, the market sentiment softened, sales declined, and some profit-taking occurred, ultimately closing at 510 million yuan, a small decrease of 7 million yuan compared to the previous day. "Old Knife" cigarettes dropped by 16 million yuan. Other domestic and foreign carton cigarettes, as well as listening cigarettes such as "Craven A" and "Three Fives," also declined by varying amounts, ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for daily necessities, such as soap, saw many buyers due to the bi-daily settlement of accounts. Holders of goods were unwilling to sell lightly due to the continuous rise in raw material prices. Upon opening, "Gu Ben" soap was bid up to 35.5 million yuan, "Arrow Knife" to 34.5 million yuan, and "Huang Xiangmao" saw transactions at 24.7 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was no shortage of selling at high prices, and the supply in the market was relatively abundant. "Gu Ben" soap fell back to close at 34 million yuan, still up 1.5 million yuan from the previous day. "Arrow Knife" also rose by 1.5 million yuan, while "Xiang Mao" soap fell back slightly by 200,000 yuan. "Guang Hua" soap, due to its relatively low price, was favored by buyers, and the price was good at 24.5 million yuan, with many transactions. Other soaps, such as "Henry Cow" soap, also followed suit with increases ranging from 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan. Matches also showed a bullish trend. "Beautiful" matches saw particularly strong transactions, with prices rising by 3 million yuan. "Phoenix" rose by 1 million yuan, and other brands such as "Nanjing," "Da Hua," and "Tiger" also showed improvement.</p>
<h3>Xia Jin Xiong and Li Lixia Go to Beiping to Discuss the Opening of Shanghai Exchange Technology</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 1st] National Bank representatives Xia Jin Xiong and Li Lixia, having completed the public sale of grain in Tianjin, went to Beiping on the 1st to discuss the issue of circulating exchange certificates and opening Shanghai exchange technology.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] National Bank officials Xia, Li, and Wang arrived in Beiping at 10:00 AM today from Tianjin and visited Fu Zuoyi. The Shanghai exchange is now open, and coinciding with the end-of-month bank settlement, prices have shifted from rising to weakening.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of US Aid Materials Shipped to China: Seventh Period Quotas Likely to Decrease</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to sources at the Import/Export Control Committee: The fifth period quota allocation has already begun, and the sixth period is still pending. The seventh period quota numbers have not yet been decided. Because US aid materials are about to be shipped to China in large quantities, and some of these materials conflict with import quota materials, the seventh period quotas are likely to decrease. In addition, the person in charge of the Export Promotion Division of the committee has returned to Shanghai from Taiwan. During this trip, they conducted on-site research on the export of Taiwanese and Fujian native products, hoping to increase foreign exchange income through this.</p>
<h3>Serge Suitings in Demand</h3>
<p>The market for woolen, cotton, silk, and yarn fabrics has remained steadily and subtly bullish in recent days. Summer goods are weakening, while winter goods are particularly popular. White serge is far more popular than "Ji Li Ding" and "Pai Li Si." Plain serge is also expensive due to limited output from various factories. Dark blue is the most popular color, followed by grass green. Gray has become newly popular in recent years, and demand from clothing manufacturers both locally and in other areas is strong, with market prices far higher than any other color. Medium-thick serge is a popular item and is gradually coming into season, resulting in demand exceeding supply. This is due to limited output from various factories and continued price increases from the China Textile Corporation, with prices expected to exceed 10 million yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi [Our Wuxi Dispatch, 1st] All markets here are closed due to the sealing of customs and the interest settlement period. However, credit has eased, with underground interest rates falling to 20%, but there is still little demand. Prices outside the market are firm and bullish, all for the opening of customs accounts. White粳 is 18.42 million, 粳稻 is 8 million, wheat is 13 million, white wheat is 13.2 million, flour is 5.4 million, soybean oil is 2.85 million, and cotton yarn is 720 million.</p>
<p>Chengdu [Our Chengdu Dispatch, 1st] Rice prices in Rong (Chengdu) rose again on the 1st. The price limit was raised to 25.6 million for a double-stone measure, and transactions have returned to normal. The black market for gold certificates is rampant again. All the city's banks are settling accounts and are closed for two days.</p>
<h3>Person in Charge of the National Economic Council Discusses Future Trade Policy</h3>
<p>The quantity of imports will be limited by exports</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] After the announcement of the "Regulations on the Use of Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates," China's current trade policy must be coordinated accordingly. The business community is paying close attention to whether the import of raw materials can be gradually increased in the future. According to the person in charge of the National Economic Council, Chairman Huo of the Import/Export Control Committee stated at a press conference on June 2nd of this year that one of the trade policies to be adopted in the future to cooperate with the new foreign exchange settlement method is to guarantee that basic industries obtain the necessary equipment imports to encourage the development of national industries. However, the quantity of import trade in the future will be limited by the quantity of export income. In other words, expenditure will be determined by income. Therefore, whether the import of raw materials can be gradually increased depends on whether the source of foreign exchange can be sufficient.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Dynamics</h3>
<p>Private Industry and Commerce Surrounded by Enemies</p>
<p>The more concentrated wealth becomes, the more chaotic the situation becomes, and the pressure on private industry and commerce becomes heavier day by day. This phenomenon is not unique in Chinese and foreign history books. Taking the current situation of the business community as an example, it can also illustrate the general trend. It cannot be denied that the city's private industrial and commercial enterprises have fallen into a predicament surrounded by enemies. The various dynamics of the business community in the past week are enough to prove the worsening of this situation. The larger events are listed below.</p>
<p>(1) Since the Legislative Yuan had a heated discussion on the proposal for a temporary property tax submitted by Legislator Liu Butong and others, the city's business community has been in an uproar. According to the proposed "Temporary Property Tax Regulations," corporate property and personal property will be taxed simultaneously. All operating businesses with a net property value exceeding 30 billion yuan (approximately equivalent to 30,000 yuan before the war) will be included in the tax scope. The tax rate starts at 5% and progresses to 60%, and it is stipulated that this property tax can be paid in kind. Although this temporary tax proposal has not yet been finalized by the Legislative Yuan, judging from various signs, it seems that there is an unstoppable trend. As a result, it aroused a wave of opposition from the city's business community. The City Chamber of Commerce, the City Industrial Association, the Banking Association, the Thirty-Eight Trade Associations, the Industrial Association Preparatory Committee, and the City Council have successively telegraphed the Legislative Yuan to veto the property tax bill. The reason is that although the tax ostensibly uses the amount of property as the standard for collection, the real wealthy tycoons have either already fled the country or have found ways to evade it. Therefore, the actual target of collection is bound to fall on private industry and commerce, which is similar to the "Special Relief Donation" that evolved from the previous property tax. Furthermore, if the proposed property tax threshold is 30 billion yuan, then, according to the price index, all ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises with more than 30,000 yuan before the war must be taxed. If industrial and commercial enterprises with a capital of 30,000 yuan before the war are required to pay a property tax of more than 5%, in the current depressed social situation, the industrial and commercial enterprises will collapse immediately. In addition, the proposed property tax also stipulates that it can be paid in kind. Industrial and commercial enterprises with weak liquidity will inevitably be forced to present their production tools. If this tax is levied, private industrial and commercial enterprises will suffer a fatal loss. Therefore, the City Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association Preparatory Committee jointly telegraphed the President of the Kuomintang and the Standing Committee on Thursday of last week, pointing out the pros and cons, stating, "If the levy of property tax cannot target the wealthy, it will lose the meaning of curbing capital and suppressing magnates. If it is considered that industrial and commercial enterprises are easy to bully and deceive, and it is okay to call a deer a horse and transplant flowers, then it will be difficult to hide the truth from the world, and ignoring reality will inevitably lead to disintegration." The shouting reached this point! In addition, the Industrial Association Preparatory Committee decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition for the veto of the property tax. But what the outcome will be probably requires the city's business community to make greater unity and effort!</p>
<p>(2) The textile industry feels a great lack of raw cotton. According to Wang Lanseng, the acting chairman of the Yarn Control Committee, the country currently has 300,000 bales of cotton in stock. During the period of transition, there is a shortage of 400,000 bales of cotton. If US aid cotton is allocated in twelve months, then only 175,000 bales can be used by the end of October. The shortage of more than 200,000 bales is hopeless unless there is a way to exchange cotton for export yarn and cloth and purchase it. On Wednesday of last week, the Six District Cotton Spinning Association held a board meeting and passed an emergency motion due to the lack of raw cotton, resolving that factories with insufficient cotton in stock and the Yarn Control Committee unable to provide emergency assistance are forced to reduce work by 20%. It seems that the country's leading cotton textile industry must also reduce production to adapt to the situation!</p>
<p>(3) Promoting sales is originally the only way out for private industrial and commercial enterprises. The National Goods Exhibition Conference, which opened recently on the 19th and was sponsored by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, also has this intention. However, while doing their best to promote national products, they discovered a large number of smuggled printed silks and satins with very low costs, which were flooding the market and dumping. As for the issue of the bidding for Japanese woolen fabrics, although domestic manufacturers once protested, it was reported that the China Trust Bureau will continue to bid. Comparing the two sides is a profound irony!</p>
<p>(4) The authorities are indeed eager to try to promulgate new taxes, and they are also sparing no effort to increase old taxes. According to news from Da Gong She, the city's business tax rate was previously determined by the Ministry of Finance to restore the tax rate to 3%, but it was vetoed by the City Council's five general meetings. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the City Finance Bureau and that the tax rate must still be doubled to 3% (originally 1.5%). It can be seen that the so-called veto of the City Council is very weak. The plight of private industrial and commercial enterprises is probably unprecedented!

<h3>Ministry of Education Allocates Funds to Subsidize Beiping City to Relieve 100,000 Out-of-School Children</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Zhang Tianlin, Deputy Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, went to Beiping to assist in the establishment of the Basic Education Demonstration Zone and returned to the Ministry to report. According to reports, there are 240,000 school-age children in Beiping, only 130,000 are in school, and more than 100,000 are out of school. The central task of the district is to make them enroll in school. Beiping's economy is special, and 70% of the education funding relies on central subsidies. Therefore, increasing schools and adding classes is problematic. The base salary for teachers is only 71 yuan. Their life is poor, but their teaching spirit is very good. However, teaching materials and methods still need to be improved. The students are disciplined and clean, but lack vitality. The Planning Committee of the Beiping Basic Education Demonstration Zone has now been established. The Ministry of Education will subsidize 80 billion, which can add 150 classes and build a new model primary school to accommodate 10,000 students. Before leaving, urged Li Zhaohuan to take up his new position.</p>

<h3>Ministry Orders Jinan University and Haijiang School to Enroll Overseas Chinese Students for Further Education: No More Than 20% of Mainland New Students</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Because overseas Chinese scattered overseas are restricted by local government regulations, the education of their children is restricted, and more and more people return to China for further education, but most of them do not understand the language of the motherland, and it is more difficult to apply to other schools. Therefore, the Ministry of Education specially ordered the National Jinan University and Haijiang School to adhere to the principle of enrolling genuine overseas Chinese students. When recruiting students every year, special attention should be paid to overseas Chinese students, who should not be less than 80%.

<h3>World Games Football Team Suffers Defeat in Singapore</h3>
<p>Lost 0-1 to Military League</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 30th] Our World Games football team lost 0-1 to the Singapore Military League team this afternoon, suffering a second defeat in Singapore. During the first half, our World Games team attacked fiercely, proving to be a strong team, but ultimately failed to score. There were two factors contributing to the defeat: one was underestimation of the opponent, and the other was the poor performance of the defenders, which exhausted the forwards. With only ten minutes remaining, the World Games team fought hard to equalize, but due to an excessive desire to score and repeated missed opportunities, they failed. In this match, only the left-sided Liu Song-sheng and left-forward Xie Wen-liang performed their duties satisfactorily.</p>

<h3>Sino-Philippine Baseball Friendship Games: Red Sox Show Their Skills, China Team Ready to Face Them, Opening Ceremony at 3:00 PM This Afternoon at the Racecourse, Wu Mayor to Officiate</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Red Sox, champions of the Manila baseball league and sports envoys with the mission of fostering goodwill between China and the Philippines and the United States and the Philippines, are visiting Shanghai at the invitation of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Federation to perform. The first game against China, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon at the Racecourse, has been moved to 3:00 PM this afternoon due to the wet and unusable condition of the field. Mayor Wu has been invited to officiate at the opening ceremony. Admission is free. Players participating in baseball and softball games organized by the U.S. Navy or the International Sports Association can enter the field with their player cards. Guests with complimentary tickets are also welcome.</p>
<p>The visiting team is a semi-professional team organized by the De La Salle University Transport Company in the Philippines. Almost all the best baseball players in the Philippines have been recruited. The nine starters and two reinforcements are all seasoned veterans with over ten years of baseball experience. Pitcher Ocinni has been dominating the Sino-Philippine-Japanese baseball scene for nearly twenty years and can be called the unparalleled player in the Far East. Catcher Ramos was a national player representing the Philippines at the Far East Games held in Manila as early as 1934. Other players such as first baseman Rosa and shortstop Raymond, have participated in international games several times. The team has strong power and can both defend and attack. In the Manila Bay League this season, their batting average reached 0.290, and they only lost twice in twenty-two games.</p>
<p>The Chinese team has not been formed for long. In the local league, they have only lost once to the Air Force, the strongest team. The team focuses on defense rather than offense. Pitcher Yu Chang-luan has struck out 29 batters in four games, making him the second-best pitcher at sea. The other players are either famous players who studied in Japan in their early years or new talents who have emerged in recent years. Their defense in both the infield and outfield is relatively solid, but whether they can stop the Philippine army's sharp edge will depend on the tactics of manager Mei and coach Liang. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>[China] [Red Sox]</p>
<p>Yu Chang-luan Pitcher A. Ocinni</p>
<p>He Jin-ben Catcher Lemos</p>
<p>Bao Guan-da First Base Rosa</p>
<p>Liang Shu-song Second Base Zorf</p>
<p>Liang You-wen Third Base Parrejos</p>
<p>Liang You-sheng Shortstop Raymond</p>
<p>He Jin-gui Left Fielder Salton</p>
<p>Zhong Bao-lu Center Fielder Ocinni Jr.</p>
<p>Liang You-yi Right Fielder Guamca</p>

<h3>Wimbledon Tennis Championships: Men's Singles Final Today, Australia's Bromwich and America's Falkenburg Compete for World Tennis Crown</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 30th] The 1948 Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship will be contested on Friday by Australia's Bromwich and America's Falkenburg. In today's semifinals, Bromwich defeated Hungary's Asboth 6-3, 14-12, 6-2, while Falkenburg defeated America's Mulloy 6-4, 6-4, 8-6. The match between Bromwich and Asboth was a grueling battle lasting two hours and ten minutes. The Australian powerhouse relied on his long baseline shots to gradually wear down his opponent. The two players played without aggression, rarely hitting fierce shots, and instead employing trick shots, making it a unique match not seen on the Wimbledon Centre Court for many years. Both Bromwich and Asboth seemed to be playing according to the textbook, reminiscent of the classic techniques of the early days of tennis. Bromwich won the first set relatively easily, but the second set lasted 85 minutes before Bromwich finally won. In that set, Asboth only led twice, at 4-3 and 8-7. At 8-7, he only needed two more points to win the set, but unfortunately, he failed to do so. In the third set, Bromwich became more and more courageous, ending the match in 17 minutes with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>The match between Falkenburg and Mulloy was completely modern and explosive, in stark contrast to the match between Bromwich and Asboth. The entire match lasted just over an hour. Falkenburg's victory over Mulloy, the third seed, as the seventh seed, was somewhat unexpected. Falkenburg relied heavily on his serve and volley game to win. It was said that if they had played another set, Falkenburg might have lost. In the third set, the score was tied at 6-6 at one point. Unexpectedly, Mulloy's serve failed, and Falkenburg won with his serve, thus deciding the final fate.</p>
<p>There was an upset in the men's doubles semifinals, with South Africa's Sturgess and Britain's Mottram, who were seeded fourth, losing to Sweden's Bergelin and Australia's Harper, who were not seeded, by a score of 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. In the semifinals, the Bergelin/Harper team will face America's Tom Brown and Mulloy. Special facilities for clinics that do not charge for medical expenses are made to provide the best possible service.</p>

<h3>Ji Hua Hospital to Participate in Poor Women's Assisted Delivery Program, Benefiting Impoverished Mothers in Four Districts</h3>
<p>Special clinics are set up to provide free medical services and do their best to serve.</p>
<p>The "Assisted Delivery Movement for Impoverished Women," jointly organized by our newspaper and five major maternity hospitals including Ren He, Shang Xian, Bao Li, Hui Sheng, and the Red Cross Society, has been ongoing since last spring and has benefited over 400 impoverished mothers in the city. This charitable initiative has been well-received by all sectors, thanks to the full cooperation of the participating hospitals. Recently, due to a sharp increase in the number of applicants and the widespread distribution of mothers in various districts, the original five hospitals sometimes had difficulty coping. Last month, Ji Hua Hospital at the intersection of Julu Road and Fumin Road volunteered to participate in the cooperation. The hospital is located in the western district of the city, with a quiet environment, spacious buildings, and perfect facilities. Under the painstaking planning of the hospital director, Dr. Xu Ji-hua, the hospital's work has been steadily improving. This cooperation with our newspaper on "Assisted Delivery for Impoverished Women" will begin today and will undoubtedly benefit the poor in the western district. In addition, the hospital also has an outpatient department, with internal medicine hours from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM and surgical hours from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The hospital welcomes impoverished patients introduced by our newspaper for treatment, with medical expenses completely free of charge. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are commendable.</p>

<h3>Talking About Churchill's Memoirs</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>After the end of the war, memoirs and similar materials seem to be quite popular abroad. Following our newspaper's "Hull Memoirs," British wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill's first volume of war memoirs was published in New York on June 21 this year. The book is titled "The Second World War" and is said to have a total of five volumes. It is currently unfinished, and the entire book will probably be published in two or three years, or it may take longer. According to the "New York Times," which published an abridged version of the first volume, the second volume will not be serialized in the newspaper until January next year. The "New York Times" has always been keen to publish good works before the publishers, so it is estimated that the entire book will take at least two or three years to complete.</p>
<p>However, as far as I know, there will be at least three Chinese translations of Churchill's great work appearing in mid-July. One of them is a complete translation, said to have obtained priority publication rights from the original publisher. The other two are abridged translations based on the "New York Times," and the other is published by Nanjing, which is probably also an abridged translation. Generally speaking, it is best to read the original text, followed by a complete translation of the original text. However, I believe that memoirs often contain many documents, so unless they are seriously studied as historical materials, a more appropriate abridged translation is preferable, both in terms of time and resources. Especially in today's difficult publishing conditions and purchasing power, abridged translations have their own objective needs.</p>
<p>The Second World War was a major event in human history, and its impact continues to reverberate today. All current international disputes are still related to the Second World War. In fact, although the war form of the Second World War has ended (in fact, strictly speaking, even the war form cannot be said to have ended. For example, the Allied countries have not yet officially established a peace treaty with Germany and Japan, and are still technically belligerents), its historical factors are still developing. Therefore, it is not yet the time to study this major event from a historian's point of view. What ordinary people urgently need to know are the various inside stories of this major event, that is, so-called unofficial history or foreign history. Therefore, works such as memoirs have emerged.</p>
<p>Although I have likened memoirs to unofficial history, I do not mean to underestimate them. The only difference from official history is that the former is often scattered, unsystematically organized, and the writing attitude is of course mostly subjective, and sometimes it does not shy away from its prejudices. But precisely because of this, readers feel intimate and realistic, and they are more lively than reading those cold official histories. Moreover, memoirs are ultimately different from the general unofficial history, they are indeed valuable materials for future historians.</p>
<p>If the "Hull Memoirs" is the inside story of American politics during Roosevelt's administration, then Churchill's "Second World War" is much broader and more complex in content. Hull was only an American literary politician, while Churchill was not only a veteran of two wars and the leader of the Conservative Party, but also an excellent soldier. His literary and military talents are probably only comparable to General Eisenhower, the current president of Columbia University, but Churchill's political courage is difficult for even General Eisenhower to match. In his memoirs, Churchill wrote that when he took office as wartime prime minister, he proudly said that he did not feel excited or surprised by this great task. He was confident that everything he had done in the past was to prepare him for this day, and he was confident that he was a person who walked with destiny. If these few sentences were spoken by any other person of the time, readers would definitely feel a little nauseous, but looking back at the storms that Britain experienced during the four years of the war against Germany, and finally appeared in the posture of final victory, who said that Churchill should not make such a big statement!</p>
<p>However, Churchill may still have his sadness. At the end of the first volume, he said: "When all our enemies have or will unconditionally surrender, my voters decided to relieve me of the position of managing their affairs." (The general idea is this) The Conservative Party's defeat in the 1945 general election was perhaps unexpected by Churchill. But Churchill's acceptance of the order in times of crisis and his retirement after success not only set off his personal greatness, but also fully demonstrated the democratic style of British party politics.</p>
<p>After reading a few memoirs published by the British and Americans, I was inspired to have an extra-territorial impression. Although there are still people criticizing countries like Britain and the United States as fake democracies or pseudo-democracies, they still have a generation of retired politicians who are willing to use writing to tell us about the war and its inside stories, and sometimes frankly admit their mistakes. Perhaps some people will say that this is still part of the "Cold War," and its purpose is to self-promote. But we should admit that when a person is willing to express himself in writing, his expression process always contains an element of conscience introspection. This is different from purely strategic propaganda texts. For example, the wartime German diplomatic secret documents partially released by British and American diplomatic agencies, and the "historical falsehoods" issued by the Soviet Union in response to this, cannot be as valued as the memoirs of Hull and Churchill because of this reason.</p>
<p>No one can predict when the world will see a scene of singing and dancing; however, I believe that if all the important figures on the international stage can now retire to the countryside and write some of their memoirs, then in addition to their personal reflection, perhaps they can contribute to world peace.</p>
<h3>"The Analects Say"</h3>
<p>— Qian Wen</p>
<p>The smashing of the Kong Family Shop has long been regarded as a thing of the past; it is unknown to what extent it was destroyed at that time. Even today, there are still people who care about throwing a few tiles into it, but its destructive power is far less than that of the May Fourth Movement. It is said that the Kong Dao is so great that nothing can accommodate it, but fortunately it has not yet reached the era of "having nothing to accommodate." I have not seriously studied this kind of Dao, so I cannot explain it clearly.</p>
<p>The old gentleman said that it is difficult to raise women. If you just copy out these four words, what is it if not an insult to women? However, I know that it does not refer to my mother, aunts, sisters, wife, daughters, maids, nor does it refer to farmers, workers, or even the social stars "××" and "Flower" and so on, so I don't have any ill feelings towards him. Although he often talked about the righteousness between rulers and subjects, he should not be convicted of anti-democracy. I am not interested in anything he said or did that belongs to the non-modern era, such as going to court and attending meals with the ruler, or entering the ancestral temple. He was unwilling to give Yan Lu his car, which was not a car, and there were no buses, trams, or transportation to take if it was sold.</p>
<p>Since a certain year, Americans have found it fashionable to say the name Confucius, but I don't like to hear Englishmen and Americans talk about him. The British and Americans often think they are right about small things, such as reading the pronunciation of words. They pronounce "Confucius," which is spelled out in Roman letters, a bit like their word "confusion." However, I will never protest to them, because when we call "Homer," only Chinese people can understand it. The English, Americans, Germans, Dutch, French, Italians, and Greeks all have their own names, and everyone thinks they are right.</p>
<p>In recent documents published in the newspaper, many quote the Analects. This does not prove that the Kong Dao is popular, but proves that the legacy of Confucius must be read, even students of science and engineering must read it, otherwise they will not know what they are talking about when the documents are quoted. It is very convenient to quote ancient sayings in speaking, writing, or litigating, especially quoting Confucius. All those who quote ancient sayings will quote those that are suitable for my use. For example, the benevolent will naturally quote "Being rich is not benevolent," while the greedy will quote "Being benevolent is not rich" is inevitable. Ancient sayings can also be slightly modified for my convenience, for example, a loyal and honest elder will say "I would rather someone bear me, than I bear someone," while a traitor will definitely say "I would rather I bear someone, than someone bear me." Those who quote the Analects, because they are the words of the Great Sage and Teacher, the act of modification has not been seen yet.</p>
<p>There should be a principle for quoting the Analects. Let me illustrate with an example. It is acceptable to quote what a gentleman does, but it is not acceptable to quote what a villain does. Saying what a gentleman is like means saying that everyone is a gentleman, saying what a villain is like seems to treat people as villains, so you must be careful. Also, language values auspiciousness. Saying that a country has pursuit is pleasing at all times, but the opposite is bad.</p>
<p>Confucius was a very good speaker. Reading his legacy, I often feel the pleasure of scratching the itch in my heart. This is my personal opinion, and I think it is better not to disclose it. I want to talk about it further, but it is not necessary.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Literati</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>The master of humor, Mark Twain, invested as much as possible in machinery in 1929, and as a result, all his property was lost, and he was so poor that he was heavily in debt, leaving only the chimney of the kitchen!</p>
<p>Goldsmith, the author of the famous novel "The Vicar of Wakefield," was arrested for owing rent.</p>
<p>Balzac was also too much in debt, and when he heard the doorbell ringing, he dared not go out to open the door.</p>
<h3>Horse Meat Relief to Europe</h3>
<p>— He Dao</p>
<p>Among the relief foods transported from the United States to European countries, there is one thing that accounts for a very large proportion, but it has never been mentioned in official documents - this frozen thing is horse meat.</p>
<p>According to a recent report by American reporter Robert Allen, the total amount of horse meat shipped to Europe last year was more than 100 million pounds. Why ship so much horse meat out? The first reason is that horse meat is cheap, and its price is less than half that of other meats. Moreover, European countries do not seem to have any prejudice against horse meat (Americans do not eat horse meat now). It is said that the people of several countries also think that horse meat tastes fresher than other kinds of meat, and some people say that horse meat is cleaner than other meats. The biggest customers of horse meat are Belgium and Sweden. Recently, in one month, 3 million pounds of horse meat were shipped to Belgium, and 2 million pounds were shipped to Sweden. Other countries such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal also have many people who want to eat horse meat.</p>
<p>Americans never ate horse meat until the Great Depression from 1930 to 1932, when slaughterhouses began to kill horses for food; at that time, about 100,000 horses were killed each year. By last year, 300,000 horses were killed in a year to relieve European disaster victims. In the past, the horses that were killed were old and exhausted horses, but recently those old horses have been killed, so the horses that were killed last year were not very old, they were all wild horses. Now many slaughterhouses have been opened, and the largest ones are located in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit.</p>
<h3>"Petition"</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>The word "petition" has now become a common noun. When people make requests or complaints to the government or officialdom, it is called "petition." A written expression of this opinion is called a "petition." According to Wei Lu Suo Ji, the word "petition" comes from the Book of Han. However, the use of the two words together is very puzzling. Suo Ji says: "A certain student of my door wrote a petition of ten thousand words, which he will submit to a certain department. When I read it, many of the words he used were incomprehensible. Not only were they difficult to understand, but the two words 'petition' were also very puzzling. In the Biography of Jing Fang in the Book of Han, Emperor Yuan made Fang the Grand Administrator of Wei County, with a salary of 800 shi, so that he could examine the merits and virtues of governing the county. Fang petitioned that he should not belong to the inspector, and that he should use people from other counties. According to the two words 'petition' are from this, it should be paused when reading. 'Fang Zi Qing' should be one sentence, and 'Yuan Wu Shu Ci Shi' should be one sentence. He迎用 petition, almost misread the Book of Han. I couldn't help but smile." In the world, there are many things that become right by practicing what is wrong, so how can it only be the two words "petition."</p>
<h3>Cemetery</h3>
<p>— Min Yi</p>
<p>In the most bustling heart of the city, across from our office where human voices and machines never stop for 24 hours a day, lies a rare and peaceful green space. A low wall, a few scattered clumps of winter green, and a few large trees separate the prosperous and noisy world as if it were two worlds.</p>
<p>It is like a shadow of our building, lonely and hopeless, forever looking up at our busy lives. It is rare to see people during the day, and there is not a single light at night. Only dozens of scattered tombstones on the green space seem to remind people what this place is.</p>
<p>In winter, this area is covered with white snow, but there are no footprints on the snow; in spring, this area is full of green, but there is no laughter from tourists. The light rain in early summer gently washes away the dust on the tomb covers, acting as tears of mourning.</p>
<p>One year, two years, three years, even I am too lazy to take a look, although we are neighbors who look at each other across the window every day</p>
<p>In fact, the lives of the neighbors are not difficult to imagine without looking: some are the most respected husbands of wives, and some are the most beloved children of parents. Maybe it was an old professor who was respected and admired by thousands of students, or maybe it was a big businessman who once dominated the world with the sound of whips and hooves. But now, without any distinction, they let a square cylindrical cover serve as the final symbol, and spend endless years in silence.</p>
<p>They must have experienced being alone on the vast ocean and gone through countless storms in life. They must have also shed tears for the separation of loved ones, rejoiced for the success of their careers, and mourned the death of relatives and friends, but now they are resting in the same place without exception, forced to forget enemies and friends, love and hatred, and waiting for the submergence of the waves of time.</p>
<p>A low wall protects this resting place, day after day, year after year, welcoming it is also a bit dilapidated, and it may collapse at any time. It just guards this resting place of ghosts so expressionlessly, staring blankly at the bustling world, and drawing a faint line between life and death.</p>
<h3>China's New Map Under Compilation (4)</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>Each map still uses layered colors to represent the terrain, but rivers are changed to blue.</p>
<p>The general map will include a world political map, using a broken-line equidistant projection; a Pacific Ocean map, using Mercator projection; and a Eurasia-America map, showing the relationship of the three continents in the Arctic, using a special oblique azimuthal projection. Other general maps for politics, terrain, transportation, geology and soil, agriculture, population, language, etc., will use the equal-area Albers projection, with a scale of 1:15,000,000.</p>
<p>The original compilation draft is at a scale of 1:1,000,000. However, the original map scales are mostly 1:50,000, with a quantity of more than 7,000 sheets. If we only rely on a small number of reducing instruments to reduce them one by one, it would take at least three years to complete the whole process. Therefore, we have to resort to photography. At the beginning, the first step is to recruit a large number of personnel to outline the required locations and terrain on the 1:50,000 originals using thick lines. The photographic method is then used to reduce these twenty times to create small blocks at a scale of 1:1,000,000, each block being 23 mm wide and 18 mm high. These map blocks are then pasted into the projection grid according to the position of the map corner, forming a 1:1,000,000 mosaic map, including all the required points and lines—rivers, contour lines, locations, roads, etc.—which are drawn on non-stretch drawing film. This film is then sent to the map factory of the Survey Bureau for plate making. The original map is reduced by three-fifths to a scale of approximately 1:1,600,000, creating a zinc plate, which is transferred to the projection grid of the intended map sheet using transfer paper. Blueprints are then printed. Each sheet totals four, which will be used to draw the river, terrain, human geography, and highway plates in the future. Each map sheet is mounted on a zinc plate with drawing paper, which avoids stretching and reduces registration errors.</p>
<p>Most of the final drawing work is done on a contract basis, using the spare time of the drawing staff within the institution. As for place names, they are affixed using lead-printed characters. In order to accommodate the common lead-type fonts, village and town annotations use Imitation Song style, while counties and cities still use isoline font.</p>
<p>The above is only a rough description. It is already clear that map compilation is time-consuming and laborious, and certainly not as generally imagined, where hiring two or three draftsmen for a few months can accomplish the entire task. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>An Impromptu Verse on a Visit to Xiang Lake in Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>— Qin Bowen</p>
<p>Crossing the river, I gaze my fill at the verdant fields of Yue,</p>
<p>Boundless are the misty waves, as evening gloom descends.</p>
<p>Waves compare West Lake to Xishi,</p>
<p>I suspect I'm here to visit [Ehuang and Nüying]'s spirit on the Xiang River.</p>
<p>Reedy beaches and fishermen's huts naturally form a village,</p>
<p>I cannot believe that Du Fu's soul remains within. (The lake's fish spits bubbles, also called Du Fu fish.)</p>
<p>Double oars at the round bridge, the spring water is broad,</p>
<p>The surrounding mist and emerald green leave no trace.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman is tranquil and good, my thoughts linger, (The residents liken West Lake to famous courtesans, Xiang Lake to refined ladies.)</p>
<p>The lake's water and mountains smile at white hair.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the east wind sends a light rain,</p>
<p>The red mausoleum at the tidal estuary catches the setting sun.</p>
<p>How many lifetimes of cultivation does it take to reach a fairyland,</p>
<p>Traveling all over the upper and lower lakes in all weathers?</p>
<p>Who manages the countless misty [scenes]?</p>
<p>A single peak is deeply beautiful, captivating poetic disciples. (Among the peaks in the lake, Yawu Mountain is the tallest and is popularly called Yawu Lake Mountain.)</p>
