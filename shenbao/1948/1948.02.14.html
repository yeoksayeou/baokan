<h3>王外長在參駐會席上　報告最近國際形勢　助世界經濟復興不使黷武主義復活　我決努力克服當前危機</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕國民參政會駐會委員會，十三日晨舉行例會，江庸主席，會議係秘密性質，約請外長王世杰報告最近國際形勢之外交，嗣討論議案：（一）鄭揆一等提：國立專科以上學校教職員待遇一律同等案，決議通過，送請政府斟酌辦理。（二）薛明劍等提，擬請政府注意台灣天產品之加工，籍增外匯收入案，決議通過，送請政府切實注意。（三）　前提，「請政府澄淸選政」案，希望政府能維持司法之獨立，依法辦理，不以政治力量採取壓力。決議通過送請政府切實注意。</p>
<p>王外長在參駐會之報告，會後以書而發表，全文如左：</p>
<p>（一）日和約與世界的經濟恢復中國一向渴望並致力於和約之早日成立，因爲世界和平的早日實現，可以帮助世界經濟早日恢復常態，但自迭次外長會議未能成立協議以後，早日締訂對德·對日和約之希望，因之黯淡。吾人誠不應因此而放棄完成歐洲及遠東和約之願望，但如主張先有和的再談經濟恢復，亦屬浪費時間。對於世界經濟復員一事，中國不但要支持恢復盟國損失之任何方案，即對敵國經濟，亦願見其復員，惟一切恢復敵國經濟之計劃，必須能確實保障不致使黷武主義復活。世界和平是不可分割的，世界的經濟恢復，是同樣不可分割的。</p>
<p>（二）美國對華援助　此事正在美國政府考慮之中。對於此事，我以爲行政院張院長所宣布的和國務會議所通過的十項自助計劃，必須盡量實施。其中凡不必等待外援而即可實施的，並應立即予以實施。祗有認眞執行此項方案，中國的經濟方能由自助做到自立。誠然，中國今日所遭遇的危難，與抗戰時期中最危難的時期同樣嚴重，當時的危難，國民政府曾經將其克服，吾人應一本前此之決心與信念，以克服當前的重大危機。</p>
<p>九龍城及沙面呈件　中英商討適當解決</p>
<p>（三）暹罷政變　我政府於去歲暹羅發生政變時，即決定暫緩承認暹羅新政權，以靜觀遏羅人民對於新政權究竟擁護至何程度。吾人之採取此種態度，只是遵循國際公認之一種慣例，同時，我政府對暹羅內政絕對遞守不干預之政策，絕不公開的或秘密的支援或反對任何暹羅政團。我政府不僅訓令駐暹使領官員遵守此項原則，並已由彼等儘可能勸導中國僑民避免參加暹羅國內政爭。戰前日本政府人員種種干預中國內政的陰謀，我已飽受其痛，吾人決不願將己所弗欲者加之於人，我政府對於暹羅局勢之演變，正予以最密切之注視。</p>
<p>（四）九龍城事件與沙面事件關於九龍城事件，中英兩國政府均曾提掛解決辦法，正在互相商討之中。本人深信在尋求正當解決辦法之際，中國政府的法律立塲與九龍租借地當局所注重的公共衛生，均應受到充分的考慮。至於沙面事件，外交部與內政部均已派員赴粵調查，報告即可提送到部，我政府將根據報告，與英方商討此事件之適當解決。</p>
<h3>五六兩季輸入限額　分配要點昨公布　肥料煤炭米麥等改為隨時核定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕第五·第六兩季輸入限額，十三日上午已由全經會審查小組審查完畢，限額分配表原定於十三日下午三時公布，因尚待經十四日政院臨時會通過，故延期發表，惟限額分配要點，已由全經會副秘書長顧毓瑔於十三日下午五時公布，其全文如下：</p>
<p>「關於第五·第六兩季自國外輸入我國貨物之限額，經政院輸出人管理委會審愼考量，一面爲配合國家預算，一面又須顧及廠均生產，已擬訂分配表，提經十二日全經會審議，原則通過，並推定王雲五·兪鴻鈞·陳啓天·左舜生·翁文灝·霍實樹·節貫三·樓桐孫八委員及顧毓瑔副秘書長作最後審訂，茲已於十三日上午舉行審查會，由王副院長主持，經依照張院長發表之經濟·財政自助要點十項之聲明及增加生產節約消費原則，詳加審查，並已將審查結果報告張兼委員長，即將呈請政院核定施行，以便國內廠商有一充份期間計議其本身計劃，上項新定之分配表，較原定者計有下列各點變動：（一）以前每李定一限額，現爲配合國家預算，改爲兩季（即半年）合定一數額。（二）新定之分配表內容除棉花於第四季起未列入外，現肥料，煤炭，米麥等均改爲不列限額，將斟酌需要，隨時核定。（三）小汽車第四季原定限額爲五百輛，因現到埠車輛爲數可觀，政府已另定處理辦法。第五·第六兩季擬定限額爲五百輛，仍照以前各學例不給外匯。（四）金屬品第四學原定限額爲四百五十萬美元，現第五·第六兩季共定爲七百萬美元，表面雖每季减少一百一萬美元，但政院物資供應局及善後事業委會尚　有美軍剩餘之此項物資，爲數不少，可資利用，而外國對金屬品出口，亦有相當限制。（五）藥品第四季原定限額爲六十萬美元，現第五·第六兩季共列四十萬美元，計减八十萬美元，因美國援華藥品將陸續運到，而行總衛生委會所有之聯總供應藥品價値一千餘萬美元，已陸績配發，是以現定限額係以供給製藥原料爲準。（六）紙及水漿按全經會規定，將小進成品紙張，多進水漿，俾可供給紙廠製造用之原料，增加生產，逐漸减少國內可以製造紙類之輸入。（七）烟葉，一般均認爲純消耗品，在目前社會艱困情况，尤宜力求節省消耗，且國內亦有出產，故限額减低。綜觀此次新定之第五·第六兩季輸入分配限額表，表面上似所减稍鉅，如將未列限額之各項合併計算，則較第四季原列數額所减甚微。目前我國外匯困難，不得不量入爲出，想各廠商必能諒解及此，雖化在談判中之國際援助甚爲樂觀，但亦不能全恃外援，即使友邦大量援助，我方亦仍應竭力節省，使外匯來源增加。第五·六兩季輸入限額，在執行期中，必要時當依輕重緩急之需要，隨時核定輸入數額，以期國計民生兩有裨補」。</p>
<h3>進口工業品中　應多輸入原料</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕第五第六兩季輪入限額，十三日全經會小組審查會已全部分配核定。兩季總額共爲七，四七二萬美元，平均每季爲三，七三六萬美」元，較之第四季限額五，三〇〇萬美元，第五季約减少百分之三十。此次分配表中，以柴油之數字最大，計一，八〇〇萬美元，因輪船，汽車及工業上需要柴油之處甚多，故較之第四季之限額，僅核减五萬美元。汽油之限額較前减少，第四季汽汕限額原爲二九七萬美元，現兩季已核减至每季二五〇萬美元，惟民用航空汽油不予减少，僅特別希望大都市汽車用汕應特別節省，煤油則較前酌减。菸葉第四季限額爲五百萬美元，現改爲兩季共爲八百萬美元，紙漿第五季白報紙與第四季相等，仍爲四五〇萬美元，第六季之數額尚未核定，其數字將視國內報紙增產情形再行核定。王雲五曾提議自報紙限額應予放寬，但因第四季所分配之報紙尚未完全輸入，故第五季暫仍與第四季相同，僅未予减少小包車兩季之限額共爲五百輛，包括各國駐華使節人員所用之汽車在內，較之第四季一季五百輛，已减少二分之一，卡車每季限額列爲六十二萬五千美元，其配件亦包括在內，約合二百餘輛，機器皮帶部份則予删除。又限額中之本柴，較前减少，用途亦加限制。關於化學品之輸入，規定以生產原料爲主體，生產成品則予减少。表中關於羊毛之轍入限額未予改訂，較之第四季並無增减，原因係羊毛所製呢料，可供軍警服裝之用。此外，十三日上午審查會時，並決定以下三項原則：（一）非限額之輸入品中，規定儀　圖書，教育用品仍維持每季五十萬美元；（二）進口各類工業品中，應多輸入原料，藉以增加國內生產，並儘先分配於工廠（少給出口商）（三）汽油，柴油等燃料轍入，應以用於公用事業者爲限。</p>
<h3>九龍城招待所　春節已告落成</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十三日電〕衆所注目之九龍城，春節仍於安靜中渡過，全城拆卸後，穗居民合力建築之招待所，春節落成，額曰「寶安縣九龍城居民聯合會」，新春遊客日逾千人，目睹居民愁困帳幕，飢寒交侵，莫不黯然解囊慰問。又代表劉子良除夕日突又爲港方捕去，一時騷然，咸以又有新事件發生，但旋即釋出，至在獄之朱劉兩代表，十三日恰已入獄一月，居民除派代表探監慰問外，並再促郭德華交涉釋放。</p>
<h3>張君勱在美談　我國政治金融</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山十二日電〕民社黨領袖張君勵頃宣稱：中國之一黨制度之永告結束，國民黨雖仍爲最大政黨，然其他小黨將可在政府中獲得如內閣閣員之席位。張氏於此間商會發表演說稱：如共黨不由蘇聯之招引而接收東北，則其兇熖已早被遏止矣，內外雖在進行然若干政治改革，如金融之改革與管制幣制之穩定，對商業農業之協助等，均將迅速付諸實施。張氏繼謂：雖有與此相反之論言及報道，然中國對美友好迄未稍減，吾人曾自美國獲得甚多援助及勸告，吾人對此甚爲感謝，中國能側身於反對共產主義之世界各大國中，深覺自豪。</p>
<h3>廬山春雨傾盆</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌十三日電〕廬山十三日春雨傾盆，蔣主席夫婦整日在官邸休息，前日曾遊仙人洞，並巡視圖書館。</p>
<h3>莫德惠等訪張羣　表達東北人士願望</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕莫德惠，于斌，劉哲，王徽溥，關吉玉等五人，十三日下午四時至行政院拜訪張院長，表達東北人士對於政府之願望。張氏當表示中央對於東北情形，不僅極爲重視，且極有信心。莫氏等均感滿意。</p>
<h3>立院考察團返國　乘輪抵港今來滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十三電〕我國立法院秘書長吳尚鷹率領之立法院四人考察團，完成在歐美之廣泛考察旅行後，於返國途中，今晨乘美琪將軍號輸船抵此，該幽將於明日　輪赴滬。</p>
<h3>美對華救濟款項　採購第二批糧食　國務院通知駐華大使館</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處南京十四日電〕美國務院今日通知駐華大使館關於去年十二月廿三日國會爲加添美國對華救濟援助所撥之一千八百三十萬美元之使用辦法，其中一千五百五十萬美元以上，將用以獲致小麥與食米，一百萬美元將用於醫藥供應品，五十萬美元將用於殺　劑及糧食之種子。</p>
<p>此項基金將包括於光前所規定之二千七百七十萬美元之內。該款刻正由大使館之中國救濟委員會遵照美國與中國在去年十月廿七日所簽訂之救濟協定負責處理。猶　原先規定之二千七百七十萬美元，大部份係用以購買糧食，其中相當數量業已抵達中國或正遠渡重洋前來此間。</p>
<p>中國政府爲改善對輸入糧食之運用，在沿海都市中心採用配給制度。此等努力，業已獲有進步，美國國務院有鑒於此，已核准新撥款中之大部份，將再用以採購小麥與食米。因此將有一千五百萬美元以上用於此項用途，並料將使中國另行獲得一萬九千噸之小麥，與四萬八午噸之米，運輸費用業已包括在內。此項物資，於以後三個月內全部運到後，在月前茲濟方案下美國之糧食捐助，即可在十九萬噸，其中七萬噸將爲小麥，而其餘則爲食米。</p>
<p>中國政府料將於最近宣布其利用此項物資及其他重要食糧，而實施糧食配給制度之方案。該項方案將使沿海人口衆多之中心城市，在冬末及春季糧食恐慌月份中，獲得充份之最低限度之食糧供應。</p>
<p>另有一百萬美元之餘款，現仍暫予保管，以待進一步之考慮。預料汽油及柴油，將輸入至中國，以配合另一特殊方案而促使中國本國生產之糧食，自有餘地區運至不足之處，並在可能範園內，予現有之運輸機構以更有效之運用，以保證救濟物資之迅速與平均之分配。本方案中此一部份之細節，仍在與中國政府討論中，故計劃中運輸方案之細節，將於日後宣佈。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕若干財政專家謂，中國法幣已無法整理·法幣發行額如此之大，在業國能力範圍之內，任何借款均不足以恢復其原來幣値。其他人士則謂，中國貨幣如採用硬幣本位，如銀本位，即可整理。惟此種整理約須自銀五億盎斯，甚或在五億盎斯以上，美方是否有此數量，殊屬可疑。美國現有白銀未指定用途可借給中國者，僅約一億盎斯，杯水軍薪，無濟於事。據此間所知，中國方面許多銀行家及其他金融界人士，咸以爲採用銀本位爲防止貨幣貶値唯一辦法，惟從何處得銀，則未言明。</p>
<h3>平市收購成品　總計三二四億</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕舊年前，國行委託國家行局收購成品，刻已結束，總計在平收購成品三二四億，其中購煤佔二二六億。小工業貸款共貸出一七六億，手工藝貸款三百億，尚未貸完。國行此次收購成品及貸款，因爲數非多，對金融市塲尚未引起重大刺激。</p>
<h3>楚溪春返抵平　據談保定可確保安全</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕冀宇席楚溪春十三日下午四時由保返平。據談：在保曾與黨政軍與民間各界代表交換意見，省府目前雖不能在保辦公，而對保定重視並未稍减，現正與傳總司令研究軍政配合具體方案，一切政策，以配合軍事爲依歸，倘軍事有把握，省府在平在保固皆不成問題，保各界人士對此業有諒解，黨政軍民之合作尤堪稱道，保定之安全決無問題，楚氏日內績赴天津視察。</p>
<h3>遼主席徐箴請辭　董文琦有再長瀋市呼聲</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十三日電〕瀋陽市長金鎭辭職獲准，繼任人選，以董文琦再任之呼聲最高，又，遼寗省主席徐箴亦請辭職。</p>

<h3>中蘇不侵條約　現均無倡議廢止徵兆</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕中·蘇兩國爲善隣條陸，在一九三七年（民國廿六年）八月廿一日簽訂之中·蘇互不侵犯條約之最後條文中，規定有效期限爲五年，倘屆期締約國一方認爲無繼續必要，應於期滿六月前通知另方，否則即繼續有效兩年，該約目一九四二年（民國卅一年）初次期滿，迄今已兩度延展，至本年八月　將期滿。據悉：現中·蘇雙方雖在考慮此項問題，然尚無倡議廢止該約之徴兆。中·蘇關係仍頗友好，倘至本月廿一日均無意見提出，即將再度展延兩年。關係方面人士透露，倡議廢止該約，表示兩國關係有深大更動，諒此際中蘇均不致出此，該約將自行再延兩年。</p>

<h3>鄧文儀對記者報告　全般戰局態勢　保證今年剿匪戰績比去年好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院新聞局董局長顯光國防部新聞局鄧局長文儀，昨日中午十二時假八仙橋靑年會共同招待本市中外各報負責人。出席者有潘公展，陳訓　，馮有眞，王芸生，趙　恒，詹文滸等三十餘人。鶯局長首先起立致辭，爲鄧文儀局長作介紹，並希望本市新聞界今後能多與鄧氏取得聯絡；國防部新聞局今後將派員數人，長駐上海，發布戰訊，一切均在計劃布置中，短期內可望實現。董氏報告畢，鄧氏即於堂聲中起立，詳盡報告剿匪單事全般勢態，至二時許始告完畢。茲記其演說全文如次：</p>
<p>共匪自從前年春天，由李先念的中原軍區突附實行叛亂起，快兩年了。國軍在這兩年剿匪救民的戰爭當中，曾經過了不少十分艱苦險惡的戰役，國軍傷亡失踪損失五十萬，共消滅了匪軍一百三十多萬人，差不多是一與三的比例。計算整個戰役，國軍確實是勝利的。這由於共匪從去年夏天起一直就在呌喊「反攻」與「總反攻」可以證明。最近戰局的實際情况是念樣呢？在這裏作一總合檢討。</p>
<p>一，東北戰場</p>
<p>目前各方所最重視的是東北戰場，也都很担心瀋陽的安危。其實共匪現在遼四遼南流竄的匪軍共爲十個縱隊，約二十萬人。除了想截斷藩陽海陸交通補給綫外，並沒有力量進攻藩陽。瀋陽郊區匪小部隊的襲擊，祗是擾亂性質，因爲國軍在瀋陽附近的隊伍實力，尚超過匪軍。祗要共匪敢到瀋陽挑戰，就隨時可以擊敗匪軍。國軍決不放棄東北，其戰略在固守瀋陽，長春，吉林，四平街等戰略據點，以爲他日收復全東北的基礎。東北戰爭是長期的艱苦的，它需要全國　支援，不過目前的形勢，並不如外間宣億的嚴重。</p>
<p>二·華北戰場</p>
<p>華北共匪聶榮臻的實力僅六個縱隊，不到十二萬人。聶榮臻一向是打敗仗的指揮員，去年冬天僥倖攻佔了石家莊，但十二月進擾平津保地區的戰鬥又失敗了。在察北延慶及淶水滿城一帶，共損失了三萬人。國單僅卅二師傷亡較大，不到四千人。傅總司令作義指揮的隊伍，比共匪要多一倍，平潔保及各交通綫防務已加强。最近的掃蕩戰進行的很順利。華北的戰局形勢，從此日趨有和。</p>
<p>三·晉陜戰場</p>
<p>共匪毛澤東朱總的巢穴現在晋北，由賀龍率領了不到四萬的殘兵敗將以爲守獲。彭德懷在陝北約五萬人，想回延安不成，三打檢林不下。王震帶了約三萬人在晋南呼應，合起來雖也號稱十萬之衆，但力量是脆弱的。閻主任錫山的力量，固守太原尚有餘裕。祗要國軍大舉進剿，那裏共匪的失敗，將會比去年陝北同山東戰役的進展還要容易。（下轉二版左角）</p>

<h3>利用塘沽新港　加強北煤南運　第一艘接運船駛滬</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十三日電〕塘沽新港實行北煤南運已告實現，門頭溝及開　煤陸續到達新港後，第一艘接遝船　光輪十一日抵新港，十二日由該港以自發電力用其裝煤機裝煤一五〇〇噸，費時僅七小時，該輪十三日已離港赴滬，此爲北煤經新港南運第一聲。</p>

<h3>今年一定比去年好！</h3>
<p>「一年之計在於春」·現在春節已過，全國上下都正在作今年一切政務業務的打算了·我們先就國訪部新聞局鄧局長昨天在滬招待新聞界所作的戰局報告，來推斷今年剿匪軍事的趨勢，收說一句：「今年一定比去年好」。</p>
<p>購到勦匪，我們首先承認政府在最初　實輸了一着棋。爲什麼？因爲政府寬大爲懷，過於相信了那沒有信用的共匪。政府因爲最初礙於馬歇爾將軍的調停，一相情願，想試走和平協商之路　，國內有若干政客也爲此起勁，以爲共匪究是中國人，或有人性，或還知愛國，而不知上了大當　。等到共匪阻塞了和平之路以後，政府纔下決心戡亂。這在軍事上，可說落了後着，吃了大虧。</p>
<p>但是，亡羊補牢，究未爲晚。國軍在過去的戰役中，攻佔了延安的共匪老巢，掃蕩了沂蒙山區的陳毅匪部根據地，克復了共匪盤據的蘇北「倉庫」，確已有很大的收穫。據鄧局長報告，國軍在艱苦險惡的鬥爭中，雖然傷亡失蹤損失五十萬，可是消滅了匪軍一百三十多萬人，幾達一與三的比例。這是由於匪軍雖有日寇的武器，雖有日本人朝鮮人蒙古人從中幫助，雖有蘇聯在背後撑腰，究竟是違反了民族意識，在良心上鼓不起戰志。而且匪軍的老幹部老兵　滅殆盡，新兵往往被欺騙脅迫而來，戰鬥意志自然更爲消沉。加以共匪內部分化鬥爭一天厲害一天，多數幹部不是被整肅，就是漸漸動搖。在國軍方面，雖然因爲受了「政治協商」空氣的毒害，和整編軍隊裁汰軍官的刺激，曾有一個時期士氣不無影饗，但到了政府決心戡亂，一年多硬仗打過以後，由於士兵所受血的教訓與經騐，和剿匪戰略戰術的改進，部隊中同仇敵愾的心理一天堅强一天，整個剿匪戰局，自必隨着時日而更趨順利。</p>
<p>由於國軍士氣的振作，地方自衛武力的已被重視與加强，以及配合軍事的地方政治，尤其農村土地分配工作的逐漸實施，我們相信國軍的剿匪戰績，誠如鄧局長所云，今年一定比去年好。就各戰傷的形勢看：我們絕對支持政府的新戰略。在現階段，我們要固守東北據點，我們同時要保障華北的孔道，肅淸華中華東的全面·我們相信國軍決不放棄東北的。東北長春瀋陽吉林四平等大據點，國軍一定固守着，以爲他日收復全東北的基礎的。其在關內，傳作義將軍總持華北剿匪是最適宜不過的人物。國軍在他指揮之下，機動運用，配合進步的地方政治和民衆自衛武力，華北當無共匪立足的餘地，而且我們敢料由北平出發的各大交通綫，在最近的將來必能完全打通。華東和華中剿匪總部改制以後，將來指揮統一，兵力集中，採取新的戰術，以應付共匪的陰謀詭計，同時如更能體察大部匪軍係被裹脅而非心願的隱情，剿撫兼施，使共匪有梅改自新之路，則不但陳毅匪部在魯蘇邊境必然要被廓淸，而且劉伯誠和陳賡兩部匪軍東奔西竄，在大別山桐柏山伏牛山大洪山等處落草去做寨主的妄想，也必爲國軍所粉碎。目下全國政治重心在首都，經濟重心在上海。保障京滬的安全，等於保衛全國的心臟。而肅淸長江以北黃河以南的共匪，使這一塊大地的全面積上，沒有共匪立足騷擾的間隙可乘，這是勦匪軍事最急切的戰略。而這戰略在朝野共信，軍民合作的大前提下，我們信其必能順利完成。</p>
<p>我們敢說今年一定比去年好；同時，我們極盼望朝野上下今年要比去年更努力！</p>

<h3>本年度國家總預算論（下）</h3>
<p>第六爲政府內外債整理問題。在抗戰之前，我國財政總支出中債務支出大約佔百分之三〇以上。此財政上之負担，一部份尚爲滿淸政府所遺下之賠款，一部份爲北洋軍閥政府時代所遺下之內外債務。我國民政府爲維特中國國家信用，仍忍辱而負担此項不合理之負祖。戰爭勃發後，新舉內外債頗多，故財政上債務之壓迫，將使我國財政永無健全之一日。</p>
<p>依據筆者統計，我國自戰前至民國三十三年止法幣單位公債，其本息應付額自民國三十七年至民國七十年止，累計爲二百七十七億六千五百五十三萬九千元。同期間以外幣及關金爲單位之公債，其本息應付額自民國三十七年至民國五十六年止，累計類爲三兆七千六百十億元（依據中央銀行外匯掛牌換算）兩者共計約爲三兆八千億元。茲列表如後：</p>

<p>以上共計應付債本債息累計額爲二百七十七億六千五百五十三萬九千元。外幣單位及關金單位公債應付本息表</p>
<p>公債　名稱　單位</p>
<p>民國二十六年粵省港河工程美金公債（自三十七年至四十二年）美金　一，〇九一，〇〇〇</p>
<p>民國二十七年金公債關金債票（自三十七年至四十三年）關金　九三，〇五七，五〇〇</p>

<p>民國卅一年同盟勝利美金公債（自三十七年至四十二年）美金　八二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>此外財政部會同各部發行之民國二十三年六　英金庚款公債，民國三十年滇緬鐵路金公債，尚未計入在內。綜計以上各種公債，計關金公債應付本息九千三百〇五萬七千五百關金單位，以二十元換算法幣爲十九億四千六百十一萬五千元。英金公債應付本息爲二千四百五十萬〇一千七百五十英鎊，以中央銀行掛牌四萬八千元換算一英鎊折合法幣當爲一兆一千七百六十億〇八千四百十萬元；倘以外匯平準基金委員會行市每鎊換法幣四十一萬三千元折合法幣，則將為十兆一千一百九十二億二千二百七十五萬元。美金公債應付本息爲二億一千五百四十一萬八千七百五十元美金，如以中央銀行掛牌一萬二千元折合一美金而換算法幣，則為二兆五千八百五十億元，倫以外匯平準基金委員會行市十三萬一千五百元換算，則將爲二十八兆三千二百七十五億六千五百六十二萬五千元。</p>
<p>依據筆者之意見，認爲戰時購買公債應予一律平等，蓋購買國幣單位或關金單位公債與購買外幣單位公債，原爲性質相同之行爲，但國幣公債或關金單位之本息仍照票面支付，事實上當然已受相當之損失，而購買外幣單位公債者却並未受物價之影響，此事顯係不平之至。是以筆者建議財政部對於外幣單位之內國公債，其倚本債息之償付似應依據中央銀行之牌價爲準，而絕不應依據外匯平準基金委員會之掛牌。關於外幣單位公債持劵人雖亦有損失，但其換失之程度決不如國幣單位公債持劵人之低。</p>
<p>倘政府果欲依據中央銀行掛牌而償付英金美金公債，則自民國三十七年一月以降至民國五十六年爲止，其應付之本息折合法幣爲三兆七千六百十億元，依據目前政府國庫之能力，確有一次償淸之力量。</p>
<p>政府如欲爲維持國家表面之信用，俟貨幣改革後實行以新幣償付，則深信如此鉅額之公債，將使國庫陷於破產，則本欲維持國家表面之信用者，其結果將失却國家實際之信用矣！我人要知國家財政之健全，即象徴國家經濟政治文化等一切之健全，亦即國民全體之福利。如欲斤斤於維債信而陷財政於破產，不僅爲國家政府之不幸，亦即整個民族之不幸。尤其因償付戰時外幣年終公債本息之負擔壓於國庫，國庫不能不向人民增稅，結果造成財富分配不平衡之距離更大，對於社會秩序將起劇烈的變動。此乃對國計民生均不相宜之一種近視的舉措！</p>
<p>償付此種內國公債之財源，則爲由獎公債籌措之。筆者已如前述，倘政府實行有獎公債政策，每年可收入一百兆元，儘足一次償付上述之公債本息。</p>
<p>筆者以爲：倘此等財源果能依理想實現，則本年度之預算表將如下列數字：</p>
<p>民國三十七年度國家總預算設計表（單位億元）</p>
<p>歲出之部（全年度）</p>
<p>兆億</p>
<p>軍事費　一五〇，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>經濟建設費　七五，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>公教人員生活費三〇，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>債務費一五，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>其他政務費　三〇，〇〇〇〇兆億</p>
<p>歲出總額　三〇〇，〇〇〇〇兆</p>
<p>歲入之部（全年度）子，租稅收入</p>
<p>一，統一實業營業稅收　三〇，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>二，財產稅收入（救濟）　三〇，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>三，兵役稅及工役稅三〇，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>四，其他租稅三〇，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>丑，國有財產收入</p>
<p>一，敵僞產業變價收入　一〇〇，〇〇〇〇兆</p>
<p>二，其他國有財產入　一〇，〇〇〇〇兆</p>
<p>寅，日本賠款收入　一〇〇，〇〇〇〇兆</p>
<p>卯，國盈事業盈餘收入　一〇，〇〇〇〇億兆</p>
<p>歲入總計三三〇，〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>即依據筆者粗估，本年度全年度國家預算歲出總額如爲三百兆元，但於財源則有三百三十兆元。如果再發行有獎公債一百兆元，則本年尚有盈餘一百三十兆元。此種估計並不誇大，在一個勝利國家原無財政窮困現象產生之必要！如果政府眞能體察人民心理，人民　能與政府合作，則此項預算必無實現。我人觀乎戰時英國蘇聯發行戰時公債，人民爭購公優，每每有如瘋狂，不數日即告全部銷訖，此種激於愛國精神之雄舉，誠値得我國人民之借鏡與效法者也。</p>
<p>筆者提出財產稅三十兆元，原為依據申報一月十四日南京電報，財政部長俞鴻鈞氏發表了談話「增設救濟特捐三十兆元』。筆者認爲此數並不過多，以目前市塲物價標算僅値戰前怯幣二億元耳；標算戰前美金，亦僅六千六百萬美元而已。須知當今戡亂之對象，即爲國內少數富有階級最大之敵人，倘彼等在此際猶不慷慨解襄，實無異自掘　墓。甚盼財政部能下最大決心，順利徴募此項救濟特捐！</p>
<p>其次，關於筆者所提出之兵役稅與工役稅，我國在抗戰時期，財政部曾奉命草擬辦法，筆者當時亦參加設計，認爲在我國所得稅制尚未完備之今日，爲協助財政在戰時困難之解除，實有實施此項役稅之必要。此稅有類於我國漢代之更賦制度，主要之意義自爲有力出力與有錢出錢，共同協助國訪。今日旣爲戡亂之非常時期，此稅仍有提出之必要。筆者認爲，凡我中華民國男女國民，年在十八歲至五十歲以下者，必須每年繳納兵役稅及工役稅於國庫。其數額依筆者粗枝大葉之估計，全國納稅人除匪區外約爲一億五千萬人，每人每月祗須繳納國庫一萬一千元，每年即有二十兆元。此種負担，論全國國民均能勝任。</p>

<h3>全般戰局態勢　上接一版</h3>
<p>四　華東戰塲</p>
<p>陳毅在去年冬天猖獗到了極點，華東野戰軍曾經發展到過三十萬人。但經沂蒙山區慘敗，接着魯豫與膠東的戰役也失敗，他的部下曾暗地呌喊「反攻反攻，丟了山東。」當時他的力量消失在一半以上。近半年來收拾殘部，在河北整補休息一短時間，現在合起魯西膠東蘇北，計算人數雖恢復近二小禽人，但都是新兵，實力不如前。祗有到處躲閃避戰。他要恢復去年在山東的局面，同支援劉伯承建立中原的戰塲，却力不從心，終歸要走到失敗的道路。</p>
<p>五　華中戰場</p>
<p>劉伯承去年九月在魯西失敗，走頭無路，打着總反攻南進先鋒的旗幟，實行「空心戰術，」與「三求戰術，」冒險　進大別山區，到處打家劫舍，求兵求食。並指使其太行山的陳賡，也帶了兩個多縱隊，進入豫西，以爲犄角，聲言「去年過黃河，今年過長江。」他這稱計劃，經不起國軍四面八方的追勦，圍勦，淸剿，掃蕩。他以爲「消滅民團拖死國軍」的戰術很得心計，現在他知道疲於奔命的不是國軍而是匪軍。他帶來的幾萬裹脅的北方農民，不服水土，相率逃亡，現已陷於狼狽不堪的境地。雖則他和陳賡的力量，在豫鄂皖三省的人數共在十二萬以上，但大別山根據地建不起來，陳毅的支援補給又有限制，可說劉陳二匪前途是十分暗淡。</p>
<p>六　共匪的致命傷</p>
<p>共匪現在全國的兵員人數，連東北在內，雖已超過百萬，但他本身有三個致命傷：一，是這百萬被迫參加武裝的農民，都是被欺騙脅迫，一有機會，尤其是長途行軍的激烈戰鬥之後；相率逃亡，或投誠國軍。二，是這兩年來過去共匪八路軍同新四軍的老幹部老兵，已在各次戰役中被消滅了百分之七十。規在多數的新幹部與新兵，都吃不得長期與長途流竄的痛苦，戰鬥的意志與精神都很消沉。三，是共匪近來接受國際的命令，爲保持他黨與軍的純淨，以鞏固內部，繼過去整風運動，實行復查運動，正在普遍的淸黨運動，查階級，查思想，查血綠，內部發生分化鬥爭的結果，多數幹部都動搖了。這幾點是匪的致命傷，也是他的力量已澎漲到頂點不能再發展的主要原因。</p>
<p>七　國軍剿匪的進步</p>
<p>國軍過去由於國民政府的政策要和平，要政治解決，最初毫沒有提防共匪要全面叛亂，也可說是沒有準備剿匪，所以這兩年來，國軍在戰塲上不盡知道共匪的陰謀詭計與戰法，不免有所折損。可是由於兩年來血的教訓與經騐，更由於國家民族人民與本身的存亡關係，同仇敵愾的心理，一天堅强一天。各地人民也都自動武裝，協助國軍作戰，剿匪的戰術，天天有進步。共匪再想投機取巧，是不容易了。加上國軍新訓練的生力軍，在數量與質量上，仍然超過共匪三倍五到倍，祗要政治配合軍事，後方支援前綫，總動員的工作加强起來，國軍在今年剿匪的戰績，可以保證一定比去年好，同時不難預見共匪的失敗，今年要比去年更慘。</p>
<p>老更賦稅制原由秦代丁口稅遞　而來，歷代沿用其法直至淸代，其名稱有口算，口賦，口錢，丁稅，丁口錢，丁賦，丁銀，丁算，算賦等，名稱難殊，性質則一。在漢代初年，人年丁五歲以上至五十六饞爲止，每人出賦錢百二十，爲一算，此即所謂丁賦。漢代更賦制，更有三品，有卒更，有賤吏，有過更。古者正卒無常人，皆當迭爲之，一月一更爲卒更；貧者欲得顧更錢者，次直者出錢顧之，月二千，是爲賤吏；天下之人皆直戍邊三日，亦名更，律所謂　戍；諸不行者，出錢三百入官，官以給戍者，是謂過更。由此可知，此爲我國古代國防財政政策。我人並非復古，但微收類似更賦之役稅，在此非常時期，要不失爲一稱公平之財政政策。蓋前綫浴血於冰天雪地之武裝同志，旣以生命保衛國家，而後方國民至少應有物質與精神援助彼等，如此庶能使全體國民與武裝同志對國家所表現之忠誠趨於平衡。今聞戰綫後方之一部份國人，因經濟困難而往往埋怨政府，指摘政府，馴至中傷政府，此猶如抗戰時期一部份漢奸之埋怨政府不應與日本抗戰然。彼等認爲國民政府由南京而漢口而移往重慶，中國之天下必歸日本統治，於是紛紛向日本帝國主義搖尾乞憐，甘爲走狗，甘爲傀儡。此種毫無愛國心毫無革命性之中國敗類與民族叛徒，直至其死後或入獄以後，始明嘹國民政府領導長期抗戰發揮革命力量之最後效果如何。彼等之卑鄙行動，雖無損於國家整僩之生命，但要知彼等之卑鄙行動對於國民政府抗戰之負擔上實已增加不少之困難。蓋正因由於彼等之存在，使我國思想戰綫經濟戰綫上發生不少之麻煩也，今日剿匪戡亂之役，其有關於國家民族之生存者，與抗戰相同，固不容一部分國民對國家不盡其有力出力有錢出錢之業務也。</p>
<p>最後筆者結論如下：本年度國家總預算，値此年度業已開始；現在，國民政府必須集中力量而使之成為完成戡亂建國之財政。換言之，國民政府所屬行政院·司法院·立法院·監察院·及考試院五大系統，必須協力，一方儘力增加財源，他方儘力節制浪費。例如解決國有財產中之敵僞產業問題，行政院與司法院必須切實聯繫，以最迅速而有效之方法完成其在本年度中至少使國庫增加敵僞產業變價收入一百兆元之目標。又如爲澈底解決政府各級機關庫款出納系統主管人員及其直接管理現金之人員，行政院與監察院及考試院必須互相合作，一方在人事系統上力求品質之提高，他方則加緊防範有舞弊現象之發生。而行政院所屬各部會尤須密切合作，發揮其分工合作之精神，例如假如徴收役稅，財政部與內政部必須合作而始能收完美之結果。憲政雖行將開始，但値此非常時期，吾人決不能將注意力偏重於憲政問題，而置最迫切之戰亂工作於綏圖。</p>
<p>同時，財政與金融關係之密切，財政當局必須深切體念。爲保持預算與決算無巨大之出入，必先穩定市塲物價；爲穩定市塲物價，必先吸收漫遊市塲之遊資；爲吸收市塲遊資，必須先發揮銀行之原有機能。故除財政部直接發行有獎公僓及委託中央信託局發行漢奸鎭實儲蓄獎劵外，必須命令國家行局庫七大國家金融機關集中力量，用盡適宜方法，吸收定期存款及儲蓄存款，並以貨幣改革前存款予以時別優利之規定，加速存款之吸收，藉以控制國民之購買力。</p>
<p>此外提高文官及武職人員與武裝同志之待遇，乃爲　固國民政府革命力量之基礎，如此始可發揮行政效率及戰鬥精神。此點財政當局尤須注意。</p>
<p>總之，事在人爲。本年預算前邇原無必須悲觀之理，而一切不樂觀現象，實爲庸人所自造。惟其爲人爲迭成現象，故正可以人爲力量克服之也。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾方案期早日實現　美促請西歐合作　歐洲十六國會議將重開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：華盛頓訊，國務院發言人稱，美國已同意參加歐洲復與計劃之十六國再舉行一次會議，以商討復與需要，時間大致在本月月底，地點可能仍在巴黎。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕負責方面徵實美國所傳之消息謂，三月間將召開十六國會議，日期則尚未確定。英法將爲邀請國而與其他十四國會商歐洲復與計劃。惟十六國之報告書以爲估定歐洲復興經費之基礎者，將不在此次會議提出討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十二日電〕英法政府現正向其他歐洲十四國探詢是否宜於重開十六國會議，討論馬歇爾方案。若干日前英法駐美大使會與國務部討論此事，結果三方面在原則上，同意有再開一次十六國會議之需要。新會議所將考慮之事項有二：（一）設立永久性的十六國機構；（二）研究歐洲各國問經濟合作之繼續發展。至於美國援歐之條件，將不包括在議程之內。</p>
<p>〔路透肚華盛頓十二日電〕國務部已不復反對早日重開歐洲十六國馬歇爾方案之會議，惟聲明重開日期尚未確定。美國態度之轉變，已由副國務卿羅維特知照英公使貝爾福，並已轉告法國。美官員仍盼會議重開之後，能避免各爭執之點，而集中於歐洲經濟合作，會議永久性機構之建立，並檢討去夏巴黎會議結束以來所已完成之成就，乃今後所待爲之工作。美國深欲避免他方之公然表示恐懼美國所附之條件，此項表示將顯示歐洲之缺乏團結，因此增加國會中之困籬。國務部態度變更之另一原因，乃為歐洲復與方案在參院外委會外進展之順利。昨日公布之參院外委會所通過法案之一部份，除促請歐洲國家從事合作，並迅速成立永久性經濟合作機構外，並未附帶除一歐洲國家自願接受者以外的任何條件。可見外委會及國會其他機構均願歐洲方面能即開始歐洲復興方案下之工作。</p>
<p>〔路透社波斯頓十二日電〕可能爲共和黨候選總統之紐約州長杜威，今夜在此發表演說，主張由接受美援之西歐十六國締結軍事同盟。</p>
<h3>歐洲接受美援國家　須遵守六項條件　美參院外交委員會決議</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕美參院外委會本日決議，凡接受馬歇爾計劃援助之國家，如欲繼續獲得美國援助，則須遵守若干條件。委員會所通過擬議中之法案，授權總統得終止對不能腹行自助及經濟合作諾言諸國之援助，或如美國所予之援助與美國家利益有衝突時，亦令終止此項之援助。委員會並規定接受援助之國家，必須同意（一）增加煤斤鋼鐵及糧食之生產；（二）改善其運輸之系統；（三）穩定其通貨；（四）保證充分獲得關於美援用途之情報；（五）列明當地通貨之帳目與美援之金額相等；（六）以出售物資交換為標準，以便將戰略物資轉讓美國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕美參議院外委會主席范登堡今日宜稱，委員會已一致同意歐洲各國欲得美援，必須盡力自助及互助。委員會正以馬歇爾計劃製成一種議案，提交參院表決，認爲欲得美援之歐洲十六國，必須實行保證，根據自助及互助合作，製成一共同復興方案。每個國家凶須與美國簽訂協定，自謀復興，守信勿渝。</p>
<p>任何國家有不自盡力，或不以美援用於所定目的者，美國執行員將奉命停止援助。如或情形改變，毋需繼續，執行員亦可停止與以援助。此最後一款，於某一國家受共黨控制時可以援用，停止美國接濟。法案中雖親定不得以美援移作他用，但並未將歐洲國家之殖民地除外。據范氏語記者，美國希望自殖民地取得戰略原料，以償還其所撥美元及接濟品之一部份，故尤注意於歐洲國家之殖民地。</p>
<h3>史巴克暢論　比外交政策　支持貝文計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社白魯塞爾十二日電〕比總理史巴克在國會外委會中暢論比國在國際上之地位。據公報正式宣稱，史巴克於釋明比國支持貝文外相所宣示原則的理由後，並概述獲取荷比盧支持所必要的原則，其中包括西德問題之必須與荷比盧合作解決等。史巴克堅決表示希望荷比盧得以同等地位，參加英美法即將在倫敦舉行討論德國問題之會議。史巴克繼曰，蘇聯與其鄰邦衛星國成立之協定，祗能促成類似集團之西方組成。在東歐已有組織之際，西方決不能一無組織，英法與荷比盧之合作，決非侵略政策之開端。蓋此項協定僅具互助意義而已，此等互助將爲包括經濟政治及軍事的全面合作，史達林固嘗一度表示贊成此項協定云。史氏復曰，荷比盧雖有共同政策，然每一國在此一共同政策的機構內，仍將維護其個別的權利。最後史氏表示英法鄧扣克公約業已擴大，成立更廣泛的協定確有必要云。比國會外委會當通過支特史巴克之言，僅共黨議員未表示意見</p>
<h3>中美高小到大　提出新方案</h3>
<p>建議和平解決國際爭端</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：成功湖訊，今日中美兩國聯合向聯合國小型大會提出正式建議解決國際爭端之新方案，主張在爭端提交安理會與全體大會之前，先行　致方法以消除異見。</p>
<h3>南韓共產黨　煽動總罷工</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城十三日電〕南韓共黨中央委員會今日實行總罷工，其呼籲文有「罷工至最後勝利」一言。此次罷工主旨，乃在抗議聯合國委會之行動與朝鮮之分治。按第一次總罷工之呼籲文，乃二月七日發出而致予「朝鮮全部愛國志士」者，僅請工人放下工具。新呼籲文强調反對「外國帝國主義之聖戰的和平性質」，並要求聯合國委會與外國佔領軍之撤退。其結語謂，「吾人反對南韓單獨舉行選舉，空話之時期已成過去，今日吾人必須實行矣」。同時各省有零星之暴動與罷工之舉，浦　魯（譯音）境有農民與警察衝肉，農民傷者十四人。</p>

<h3>蘇聯已有巨型機</h3>
<p>效能在超空堡壘之上</p>
<p>〔路透社　成頓十二日電〕共和黨議員梅洛告衆院外委會稱，蘇聯具有大批巨型轟炸機，效能在美國超空堡壘之上。余認空中優勢，乃若干民族所能了解的唯一十口語。若在空中優勢與歐洲復興方案中選擇其一，余必選擇前者。</p>
<h3>德境蘇佔領區宣布　設立經濟委員會　以與英美區機機相頡頏</h3>
<p>〔路透社和林十五日電〕蘇軍政府長官索柯洛夫斯基今日下令設立德境聯區之經濟委員會，設常任主席一人，以區政府勞工農業等部派代表充任委員。此一機構乃弗朗克福英美合併區經濟委員會之對立機構，其成立並未出此間人士意料之外。蓋自英美合併區憲章於二月六日公布以來，蘇方控制之報紙固已一再有此預示矣。</p>
<h3>簡行化政</h3>
<p>〔路透社相林十二日電〕據悉，蘇聯佔領當局業已設立委員會，以審查蘇聯區內各德國中央機構之人事及組織問題。據該會主席史丹納稱，該會工作須於三月十五日完成，結果蘇聯區德國中央行政機構或將有可更動。史氏並聲明此舉在簡化行政，目的不在設立類似英美合併區內之中央集權政府。</p>
<h3>美對德政策　魯爾萊茵兩區</h3>
<p>主張仍受佔領當局管制</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕衆院外援選擇委員會於今日發表報告，聲言德國鄰邦之恐懼德工業能力之復活自有相當理由。並認基於自由經濟制度的民主德國，乃歐洲和平最好的保證。報告並認法國主張使魯爾萊茵在政治上與德脫離，置於國際監督之下，勢難實行。至於英國支特德工會之建議，主張使魯爾煤礦及工廠以歸國營，以防他日從事軍事或經濟侵略，亦有重大的懷疑。折衷之道，在使魯爾萊茵兩區繼續爲政治上及經濟上德國的一部份，並設立新的公司，經營並握有魯爾區基本工廠及礦藏。在此等新公司，德國公私資本以及外國資本均有參加之機會。魯爾工鑛之經營政策及財政，應由參加馬歇爾方案之十六國再加美國及未來德國政府合組之委員會，施行監督。惟英美德三佔領強國在國際委員會中，有比較重大的表決權。至於在過渡期內，魯爾萊茵兩區，應繼續置於英美合併區當局管制之下。</p>
<h3>美新任參謀總長　擬視察遠東</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十二日電〕美參謀總長勃萊特雷將軍，如得國防部允許其出巡，將於本年夏或本年秋，擬赴菲日韓作三日視察</p>
<h3>日政局仍無進展　三黨反對吉田茂出任新首相　片山可能再度出而組閣</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京十三日電〕日本四大政黨幹事長於昨日召開會議以選擇新內閣總理，由於自由黨之堅特須由該黨領袖吉田茂出任首相，遭其他三黨之反對，談判乃陷入僵局。會議雖於今日繼續舉行，然協議之希望殊少。吉田茂繼續反對組織聯合內閣，日報預料自由黨將取獨立行動，組閣不成將退爲反對黨。又前總理片山哲告報界表示贊成組聯合內閣。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十二日電〕據今日情勢觀之，第二屆片山內閣之成立極有可能，因民主黨與自由黨之首領既不能共赴事功，復未能獲致其他方面支特，以組織能於議會中控制大多數之聯合內閣，故勢之所趨，惟有社會民主黨主席片山哲再度組閣。社會黨左右兩翼，現已體認恢復黨內統一之必要性，該黨左翼領袖鈴木茂三郎今日下午表示，渠願辭去衆院預算委員會之職位。按該委員會會拒絕通過政府所提之追加預算案而促成內閣之垮台。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十三日電〕片山首相十二日於去神奈川縣片瀨之別邸靜養之先，接見新聞記者談稱：「自日本目下之政况觀之，恐不得不成立中　之聯立內閣，縱其不穩定，亦屬無法，余因無把握收拾政局而辭職，故何人擔任下屈首相，不得而知，一切當任國會自由決定。」</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京十三日電〕下野首相片山哲十三日離東京赴橫濱附近之海濱私邸休養，然視察家稱：如僵局長此繼續，片山再度組閣之可能性當可大見增加。</p>
<h3>東歐五國研究計劃　開發多瑙流域富源　振興農工業消除稅壁</h3>
<p>〔中央社普拉格十二日合衆電〕據消息靈通之外交界人士稱，東歐蘇聯五附庸國刻正研究開發肥沃多瑙河盆地之計劃。南匈兩國爲此計劃之領導者，羅保兩國則以全力合作，匈駐法公使卡羅里特來此與捷克當局磋商此事。此計劃中包括（一）設立一小型之田納西發電所，以利用多瑙河及其支流發電。（二）修濬利用內地水道以供運輸，俾减低運輸費，並用以控制洪水。（三）增加農礦生產品之交易量。（四）擴充工業設備。此計劃中並可能討論消除關我壁壘問題，且將與五國長期經濟計劃及該五國間所訂定之若干兩國貿易協定相配合，而上述諸協定可能產生一五國全面之多邊協定。</p>
<h3>在風雪中迷途　土機被保擊落</h3>
<p>〔路透社安加拉十二日電〕土航空專家稱：在保土邊界被保國擊落之上噴火式機兩架，係在風雪中迷途，兩機係自阿特里亞郝波爾飛來，以氣候惡劣，視綫不明，在保國疆界附近無法控制，因此迷途。兩機在案蘇彼爾上空之盤旋，可證係在覓取歸途云。另據保國聲明，當土機飛入保境時，氣候殊佳云。</p>
<h3>英國與阿根廷　新商約簽字</h3>
<p>〔聯合社阿根廷京城十三日電〕英國與阿根廷談判新商約歷十一星期，已於昨夜正式簽字。其中規定英國可獲牛肉四十四萬另八百噸與家畜飼用玉蜀黍逾一百廿五萬噸，並輸出動物與植物油等非主要品價值至少四千萬美元。此外，應將鋼鐵·錫板·石絨·藥品·咸士忌酒·羊毛·織物及汽車等物售予阿根廷。阿根廷方面則獲得鐵路一萬二千哩，是爲英國在南美之最大一項投姿。代價共計現款六億美元。阿根廷並保證裝運煤斤一百萬噸與煤油一萬六千一百七十九桶。</p>

<h3>英駐美大使易人　由弗蘭克斯爵士繼任　美朝野表示熱烈歡迎</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕弗籣克斯爵士業被任爲英國駐美大使，以繼辭退外交職務之殷佛却貝爾勳爵（前寇爾爵士，曾任駐華駐蘇大使等職）。弗蘭克斯曾任格拉斯哥大學哲學教授，戰爭爆發時加入供應部供職，其後擢昇爲該部次官。歐洲十六國在巴黎舉行討論馬歇爾方案之會議時，弗蘭克斯任英國首席代表，被推爲歐洲經濟合作委會主席。其後復率英代表團赴華盛頓，參與歐洲復與談判。爵士現年四十二歲，現任牛津皇后學院校長。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕美朝野對弗籣克斯出任英國駐美大使，均表示熱烈的歡迎。弗蘭克斯之出任斯職，表示英國之重視馬歇爾方案，及英國之誠心擁護歐洲復興計劃的利益及原則。貝文外相原欲得有大使一人，得在馬歇爾方案施行的整個期間，繼續在華盛頓供職。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶錄　（九）（十）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>乘人危急之秋來刺人之背</p>
<p>沒有一個政府爲了防止另一個政府參戰而作的努力，比我們爲了防止義大利參戰而作的努力更誠摯的了。在墨索里尼參加戰爭之前，我們曾向他呼籲和施用壓力，凡五閱月。</p>
<p>四月二十日，戴樂發給我兩個電報，轉呈總統。在一個電報中，他說墨索里尼參加希特勒方面或在新地區單獨進事侵略，具有眞正的危險性。他引證教廷外交部長瑪格里昂的說話，敦促總統在二三天內採取行動，最好是立即採取行動。在另一個電報中，戴樂引證教皇的說話，敦促立即由總統致電墨索里尼。教皇說在那時候他將採取平行行動，協力以赴。</p>
<p>在接到這兩個電報之後，我就通知總統，當時他在喬洽亞洲的溫泉。他覺得在向墨索里尼表示了兩次之後（一次是經由我國大使，另一次是經由韋爾斯）他已經說得够了。檢對來自許多首都的致總統的電報，我們以爲墨索里尼的行動大致將在幾天之內發動。</p>
<p>可是在四月二十六日，戴樂又打電報來，說他又遇見了教皇和瑪格里昂外長，他們重申以前的建議。戴樂報告教廷方面的信念，認爲墨索里尼採取突然的行動是很可能的，尤其爲了他必須迅速行事，藉以克服國外反對參戰的勢力，猶如外界所傳說的。</p>
<p>四月二十八日，星期日，總統回到華盛頓。我同他一起讀戴樂發來的電報，並且告訴他英國和法國政府也擔心墨索里尼，將以武力參戰。於是總統決定他應該向墨索里尼發出一個呼籲，這一次是用書面形式的。</p>
<p>文告的起草工作，就在那天（四月二十九日）下午完成的，而在當夜用電報發給墨索里尼。</p>
<p>翌日，戴樂打電報給總統，教皇對於他以前所建議的平行行動，信守不渝，已將一個親筆書寫的文告，直接送給墨索里尼。</p>
<p>墨索里尼於五月一日接見費里普，把總統的文告讚給他聽。他說德國是無法擊敗的，希特勒的征服所造成的然新地理形勢」如不予以承認，歐洲的和平就無從予以考慮。至於義大利，他說它「幽禁於地中海內」的情勢不能容忍，並且痛駡英國之佔有蘇彝士運河和直布羅陀。</p>
<p>墨索里尼對費里普口頭所講的說話，實際上比五月二日由柯隆那大使送到白宮來的墨氏致總統的書面答覆，要溫和得多。</p>
<p>多次日，費里普打電報給我說，他看見過墨索里尼之婿齊亞諾外長，後者告訴他說英國之決定撤退地中海商船隊，對於羅馬是一種出乎意表之外的行動，因爲義大利無意參戰，除非協約國攻擊義國的話。</p>
<p>在德軍侵入荷比盧一開始之後，費里普又於五月十日打電報給我，說他又看見過齊亞諾，當時齊亞諾剛見過黑索里尼。齊亞諾說，義國並未因德軍的新行動，而決定或考慮改變方針。</p>
<p>但是剛剛在四天之後，局勢已完全改觀了。費里普把齊亞諾對他所作的聲明，用電報打給我，其中說，一星期前，他還認爲義國不蠢戰的可能性是五十對五十，現在贊成參戰的是九十對十了。齊亞諾說畢索里尼業已決定主張。</p>
<p>在倫敦和巴黎接到這個消息之後，恐慌幾達極點。蒲立特大使發給我一個嘶聲力竭的要求，主張總統應以更大的壓力加諸墨索里尼。雷諾總理要求我們以若干過齡驅逐艦售予英國和法國，因爲他預料義國的潛艇將在地中海方面開始攻擊</p>
<p>當費里普的電報一到國務院之後，我就把它送給總統。他當即決定再向墨索里尼作一次呼籲。我們於是再和他在國務院起草，而在當天（五月十四日）午夜由我用電報發給費里普。</p>
<p>總統說，「以前我曾向閣下說過我是一個現實主義者。我知道，作爲一個現實主義者的你，一定會承認假如這次戰爭擴大到了全世界，勢將超過各國首長控制能力之外，致使千百萬生靈以及人類自由文明的結晶陷於毀滅。並且沒有一個人，不論他怎樣全智全能，能够預料到對他自己者他自己人民的結果。」</p>
<p>費里普想再度親見墨索里尼，可是這一次墨索里尼傳言說，他希望經由外交部接受總統的第二個文告。三天之後，五月十八日，費里普把墨索里尼致總統的覆文用電報打給我，其中說「義大利擬與德國保持聯盟關係，在歐洲命運正在睹注之中的時候，義國不能袖手旁觀。」</p>
<p>同時，在覆文到達之前的幾天中，蒲立特在巴　設法和法國政府保持最密切的接觸，反映出他們對於戰爭的險惡轉變的一種自然的恐慌。他打了許多電報來，建議我國對義大利應採取的行動。他建議總統應要求教學威脅畢索里尼，說明假如義國參戰，教廷將與義國斷絕交往，並要求教皇以精神立塲斥責希特勒的侵略，接近發出斷絕交往的命令。他又建議我們的大西洋艦隊應派往希臘作禮儀上的訪問，假如義國參戰，義國移民的匯款應予切斷，以及義國移民和美籍義大利應通過決議案反對義國參加戰爭。</p>
<p>我會就此類建議和總統談過。假如任何步驟可以有相當成功機曾的話，我們是願意採取的。但是墨索里尼已立下決心這一點，已經是很明顯的了。</p>
<p>繼而，在五月二十五日，邱吉爾和雷諾邀請總統再向墨索里尼提出一照會。他們建議總統應根據下列諸點向他作一聲明：</p>
<p>（一）總統有理由可以相信英法明瞭義　對它們在領土問題上有若干不滿。</p>
<p>（二）目下英法充份準備考慮義國的要求，以謀獲到協議，俾在戰爭結束之後滿足義國合理的要求。</p>
<p>（三）協約國將准許義國參加和會，其地位與任何交戰國相等。</p>
<p>邱吉爾和雷諾建議總統應附加說明一點，就是假如義國避免參戰以與英法爲難，美國將竭盡所能使任何獲致協議，加以履行。</p>
<p>這些建議須由總統代表他自己提出，而非以協約國代理人的資格提出的。</p>
<p>總統對於此種辦法不久就表示同意，並無多大困難。但是他的確說過與其是照英法意思而行事，毋寗繼續他以就此問題和墨索里尼書電來往的辦法，這就是說一切是出諸他自己的主動，並非徇英法的要求而做的。</p>
<p>總統的文告是在國務院起草的，而於五月二十六日由我用電報發給費里普大使。</p>
<p>現在，在墨索里尼的面前是有一個確定的建議了·根據這個建議，他可以得到任何合理的要求，不必訴諸戰爭，而由美國保證英法將信守協定。</p>
<p>但是下一天，費里普把墨索里尼的「否」字打給我。齊亞諾對他說，墨索里尼的意思並不僅僅在實現義國合法的願望，並且要履行對德聯盟的賣任。</p>
<p>墨索里尼的答覆雖然一次比一次更仇視，但是總統並不因此灰心，還要向義國的獨裁者再作一次嘗試。我們當即起草，而於五月三十日用電報打給費里普。這一次總統說，由於　國參戰而使戰爭再擴大的結果，將立即使美國本身加緊其重振軍備計劃，並且使美國政府加倍努力，俾予協約國在美國境內獲致一切必要供應品和物資的每一種便利。」總統　提醒墨索里尼一點，就是我們在地中海方面具有歷史性的利益，至今已維持幾達一百五十年了。</p>
<p>墨索里尼的答覆甚至比以前更確定，更仇視。五月三十一日，費里普把齊亞諾的聲明用電報打給總統和我，其中說墨索里尼已經決定參戰，現在祗是短時間的問題—幾天的問題。當費里普說明假如義國參戰美國大衆對義態度將發生重大變化時，齊亞諾同答說，此點已經考慮過了。　翌日，費里普把畢索里尼自己的聲明打給我，其中說他願意履行對德國的責任，不願意「再受到任何壓力」，因爲這種壓力，「適足以使他的態度更見強硬」。他說他並不相信義國的干涉一定會使戰爭在地中海方面擴大，並且質詢我們在地中海區的利益要求，聲言此等要求等於義國在加勒比安海區的要求一樣。</p>
<p>至此，法國直接向墨索里尼表示，願意解決義國的領土要求。但是，六月三日，蒲立特打電報給我說，齊亞諾同答法國駐義大使，聲稱墨索里尼對於經由和平談判方式接受任何法國領土一點，並不發生興趣。他已決定對法作戰，對於法國的照會不擬答覆。</p>
<p>總統和　爾斯還想利用法國的意思作爲跳板，再向墨索里尼提出一個呼籲。文告草案已在國務院中擬就。但是到那時候，我覺得對於一個決心以戰爭來滿足其自己的虛榮的匪徒，呼籲已經太多了。我極肯定地反對發出這個文告。我的反對發生了效力，這個在六月七日準備好的文告，並沒有發出。</p>
<p>當墨索里尼於六月十日向英法宣戰的時候，我們中間任何人都不感到驚奇了。　那天晚上，總統在浮琴尼亞州夏洛德維爾城的浮琴尼亞大學發表演說。他申述他爲防止義國參戰而作的許多努力。於是他說：</p>
<p>「在一九四〇年六月十日這一天，擔有短刀的這隻手，已經把它刺入鄰人之背了。」</p>
<p>這個字句，在我們在國務院起草的草案中是有的。　爾斯向總統建議，將其取消，因爲這樣一說將使墨索里尼對他如此存有惡感，致使在談和之時到臨之際，無法獲得他的合作。事實上，刺人之背這個觀念，早在五月二十日雷諾總理就曾用過，其在蒲立特的電報中也提起了好幾次。總統把這個字句從他的演詞中剔去，但是在赴夏洛德維爾途中改變了主張，重新把它插了進去。</p>
<h3>英將實施　物價管制</h3>

<h3>英美法即將發表　德全部秘密文件</h3>
<p>蘇聯宣傳不值一駁</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕英外部發言人稱：英美法不久將共同披露德國之秘密文件，二次世界大戰前關於英德關係之文件亦將包括在內。發表者係文件之全部內容，不若莫斯科最近所發表者，僅以當時英外相哈立法克斯及英大使漢特森之談話爲限。英美法共同發表之文件，共達三册之鉅。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕外部發言人今日否認蘇聯指責英國會於一九三八年與希特勒有反蘇企圖，謂此絕無根據，不值一駁。蘇新聞處昨夜宣布，自抄獲之德國檔案中發現戰前英法政策，旨在慫恿希特勒侵蘇。英法默許德國佔據捷克與奧地利，英法並與希特勒有互不侵犯之諒解。</p>
<h3>美物價慘跌　兩黨推諉責任</h3>
<p>村魯仍盼管制物價</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十二日電〕美國物價於最近八日來下跌頗劇，美商人於研究最近市塲動態後，發現股票價值，已跌落卅億美元，一般貨物之慘跌，在美國史上，已無前例，際此政治家金融界領袖及各報紛紛向人民保證此種現象，並不足懼時，政府及共和黨對物價下跌，互諉責任之舉，實堪玩味，刻各方的預料恐將發生可憂之不景氣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門總統今日在記者招待會宣稱，物價雖已下跌，但通貨膨脹仍爲一大危機。國會必須進行制定余在去年十一月十七日提出之法案，切實管制工資與物價。</p>
<p>〔合眾社芝加哥十二日電〕參議員塔虎特稱：渠認爲目前物價下跌仍將上昇不致引起崩潰及失業，蓋目前需要商品甚殷，而購買力極強，塔氏並相信物價下跌不致妨磯全部職業，除非物價下跌更普遍。渠認爲若干物價低落乃一件佳事，蓋此將有助抽緊私人通貨膨脹之曲綫上升，此亦不致影嚮共和黨之減稅計劃。</p>
<h3>錫蘭慶祝獨立　舉行升旗典禮</h3>

<h3>國際法庭審結東條後　美檢查組將解散　日本對華侵略罪證確鑿</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕今夜據悉，美軍已放棄續審日本戰犯二十餘人之計劃。俟東條等首批戰犯審訊結束後，國際法庭檢察組及辯護人員即將解散。華盛頓方面有此決定，係因檢察長季楠之建議。現在拘押中之二批戰犯，將由麥帥總部司法組偵查，如確有戰爭暴行，則由橫濱戰犯法庭審訊。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕遠東國際法庭今開庭時，美國助理檢察官蕯頓宣讀總公訴書之一部份，指控日本二十五名甲級戰罪嫌疑犯蓄意製造謊溝橋事件，薩頓所宣讀之一部份，爲一九三七年至一九四五年日本對華侵略戰公訴書。指控日方首岡於豐台及蘆溝橋間購地六千畝，但未購成，日方乃尋求藉口使其軍隊取得蘆溝橋，繼而控制北平。關於日方發動蘆溝橋事件以致發展爲對華進行歷時八載之侵略戰爭，證人所述之各點如下：（一）蘆溝橋區日軍兵力遠超警衛需要，中國方面人士估計有一萬五千人。日方則稱，僅有七千人，（二）日軍於七月七日夜間之演習具有「故意挑　之意圖」；（三）日軍是夜進行演習時，其武器內裝有彈藥而非空彈簡；（四）日軍舉行演習並未通知中國當局；（五）演習並未於固定之地點舉行，而於鐵路橋梁附近一帶演習；（六）僅有一被告證人，（渠於事件發生時，未在該地）支持日方之說法，即中國軍隊自宛平開火；（七）蘆溝橋事件發生後，日軍士兵或無失踪情事，蓋被告方面對於此點並無所述，而日軍即以失踪事件作爲其提出要求之藉口，聯合委會雖經設立調查事件發生之原委，然日軍則自三面包　宛平，有證人五人證明日軍首先開火。總公訴書指稱：「日軍之發動戰事證據明顯」。公訴書並謂，蘆溝稿事件「與瀋陽事件極其類似，但避免以前之漏洞」，雙方於七月九日協商同意停止軍事行動後，日軍復增援兵力至二萬人，飛機一百架，戰事旋於七月十四日再告展開，同時日軍參謀本部決定大量增加該區兵力，日本政府益以堅持「就地解決」之藉口，企圖藉此使華北在各方面地方自主。總公訴書列舉大量證詞，以證實日方之意圖。</p>
<h3>美在遠東邊綫　將作空戰演習　飛行堡壘十架飛抵東京</h3>

<h3>防止今日紅盤漲風　準備十萬擔米拋售　以年底收盤價作準　民食調配會昨召集米商談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市塲春節休假七日後，將於今日開出紅盤，恢復交易。上海市民食調配委員會常務委員任顯羣及社會局糧食科長吉明齊，於昨日上午召集米商代表，在社會局談話，商討經盤價格及政府拋售食米等等問題，據任顯群表示，外傳春節中白米門市價已越二百萬元說，係屬不確。政府唯恐紅盤米價波動，特儲備大量食米，準備隨時於市場拋售。米商因拋米將影響彼等銷路及中間商之佣金，乃要求政府在米價未有波動前，勿於市場拋售。民食調配會現先準備食米十萬擔，南北市場各分配五萬擔，如遇市場有波動時，即當隨時拋售，並將採取機動性策略。至拋售價格及市場交易價，係以去年年底市場最後收盤價格作標準。彼時產米區無錫上白粳為一百六十萬，松江粳米為一百四十二萬，蘇州白米為一百四十萬。上海交易價北市場上特粳一百八六十八萬。故今日紅盤價格將維持一百六十八萬至一百八十萬之間，如有波動，當局即以準備之食米向市場拋售。</p>

<p>右列被告等因貪污案經檢察官提起公訴，本院審理判決如左：</p>
<p>主文</p>
<p>尹　蓀·岳新民。張寶匯，共同藉端勒索財物，張淵與之共犯，尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張淵均各處死刑，張寶匯處無期徒刑，均各褫奪公權終身，又連續共同對於違背職務之行爲，收受賄賂，張淵與之共犯，尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張淵均各處死刑，張寶匯處無期徒刑，均各褫奪公權終身，尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張淵均各應執行死刑，張寶匯應執行無期徒刑，均各執行褫奪公權終身。</p>
<p>尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張寶匯·張淵，共同收受利豐永染料化學公司賄賂法幣三億一千五百萬圓，民富貿易股份有限公司賄賂法幣八億圓，天和·大康兩顏料行賄賂法幣九千萬圓，益豐公司賄賂法幣三億圓，均應由尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張寶匯·張淵連帶負責繳案沒收。</p>
<p>尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張寶匯·張淵，共同勒索陸根泉美金八千圓，除張淵繳案之美金一千二百二十五圓，巳由陸根泉領訖外，其餘美金六千七百七十五圓，折介法幣六億零九百七十五萬圓，應由尹蘭蓀·岳新民。張寶匯。張淵連帶負責繳案，由陸根泉其領。</p>
<p>事實</p>
<p>尹蘭蓀·岳新民·張寶匯，均任江海關帮辦，尹籣蓀充該關估驗課輸入許可證核對殷主任，餘充該股股員，均各職司核對商貨進海口時，是否與輸入許可證記載相符。民國三十六年七九兩月間，陸根泉開設之陸根記營造廠，曾向怡豐行定購鍍鋅鐵片（俗呼白鐵皮）四百噸，陸續由美國紐約裝運抵滬，領有輸入臨時管理委員會（以下簡稱輸管會）第一四〇四三號公佈前轍入許可證，凡許可證內命名爲公佈前者，即以修正進出口貿易暫行辦法公佈之民國三十五年十一月十七日爲前後之標準，此項許可證，依章應由充主任之尹蘭蓀核對該證，載有不准結匯，即係已由中國銀行供給外匯之意，顯非商人自辦外匯，則應放行，而尹蘭蓀平日之留難抑壓藉勢藉端勒索財物，並勾通卸職關員張淵，爲之商恰，爲之收受，早爲其同事及滬商所素悉，加以資深多能，又爲該管下級官所信用，怡豐行總經理毛　翔乘陸根泉需貨孔急，正長關員留難抑壓之際，遂夥同報關商人方茂林，輾轉經由沈彥　·張高振·梅福堂密語岳新民，囑張淵商諸尹蘭蓀，尹　蓀藉詞該證，尚應送由輸管會審核展限等情，非備送鉅額之手續費，不能免此。經張淵勾通張寶匯，並暗示梅福堂，轉知張高振，由張高振，向沈彥祿向方茂林，逐層帮助，以遂其食。梅等亦乘該機會，每一過付，必增高其額，終達美金一萬三千三百六十元之多，非如數交付，即扣留證件不發。陸根泉受拆息日增，貨資呆滯之書，忍無可忍，馳報國防部保密局密令交付，藉探實淸，果於民國三十六年十月十六十七兩日，如數交付後，始發還證件，准予輸入。</p>
<p>再利豐永顏料行，於同年六月至十月間，自美購得安尼林油顏料一百噸，及其他各種顏料數批，天和·大康兩顏料行，自美合購顏料六十四桶，益豐公司自英購得羊毛十五萬磅，民富公司由香港購得燒碱六百零五桶，顏料十七噸半，均各陸續運抵滬濱。利豐永之安尼林油，並未逾量，其他顏料則逾量或逾限，天和·大康則借用信孚公司之許可證，益　之羊毛，則超過證載量數，均囑託楊樹德設法，民富之燒碱及顏料等，則借用金山公司之顏料許可證，囑託陳良絅設法，於是楊樹攘。陳良絅各別唆令張淵，轉央尹蘭蓀等，違背職務，明知故昧，提前簽准，，陳良絅且早商得張淵同意，妄在該證內添註燒碱一項，與楊樹德各持款送由張淵分配，計利豐永交賄款三億八千五百萬元，民富交賄款八億元，天和等交賄款九千萬元，益豐交賄款三億元，張淵陸續持與尹蘭蓀·岳新民，張寶匯朋分，因此無論輸入許可證，應否由輸管會審核，或補正程序，或送行不准，或應依次序進行，概由該股提前辦結，俾已交付賄賂各貨，先行順利輸入，經國防部保密局查獲，送由最高法院檢察署令發本院檢察官偵查起訴。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>認定右列事實所憑證據及適用法案分別論斷如左：</p>
<p>（一）被告尹蘭蓀部份；（1）關於怡豐行鍍鋅鐵片輸入之件：</p>
<p>本院訊據該被告略稱：「職專司核對公佈前之輸入許可證，怡豐行之輸入許可證，係公佈前者，證內並無限期，又非黑市外匯，張淵特證來託我，我初看時，要他送輸管會非限額審核處研究，後來由沈產綠報關，岳新民親向我說，我看證內是中國銀行供給外匯，讓其過去，張淵送來美金一千五百元，就收下來了。總之月俸不過五百五十餘萬，父親死在天津，母親早死，均未安葬，還有妻室兒女，不够開支，故受到金錢之引誘，求各級長官寬恕」。參以張高振略稱：「張淵說如不送關上八千元美金，即不發單子」之語，其留難抑壓，藉端勒索財物，已足認定，况訊據毛豐翔略稱「方茂林先要報關手續費五千萬法幣，後來要百分之七，百分之八，最後百分之十五，算成美金一萬二千二百六十元，後又增加美金一千元，此千元乃因手續費交後，仍不交還提單，還要增加二千，才答應再加給一千元的」，而陸根泉則謂「毛豐翔於第一次洽商時，就要百分之十六，後减爲百分之十五，算成美金一萬三千三百六十元，合法幣十一億九千七百一十八萬元」各等語。既云當第一次洽商時，就要百分之十六，尤足證明其各被告內部勒索數額，逐一增高之陳述，乃係各被告故捏其詞，而免疑其彼此間之犯意，確已連絡，否則其帮助者，初與被害人洽商時，即索報關手續費百分之十六，而不謂祗須百分之七，或百分之八，由此可認定該被告共同藉端勒索鉅額金錢之行爲，彼此一貫，該被告乃一身負核對主管之職務，貪婪無壓，竟置政府懲　獎廉澄淸吏治之至意於不顯，殊屬罪大惡極，何能妄求寬恕。</p>
<p>（2）關於利豐永等行輸入外貨之件：</p>
<p>本院訊據該被告略稱「利豐永的安尼林油等貨，要我提前通過，送我兩千萬圓，益豐的羊毛輸入，正在病假中，張淵到我家說，羊毛輸入，業承張寶匯·岳新民通過了，送您兩千萬圓。民富的燒碱顏料之輸入，也是張淵要我通融過去，送我三千圓美金，至天和大康的事，我不知情」。又稱「我陸續借了張淵六千萬元，他說不要還了，因爲平時很帮他的忙」各等語。查報關人之報關，當有先後，不應得賄，提前許可輸入，既應審核證件，尤不可擅行通融，今因受賄之故，一則曰「提前」，二則曰「通融」，其爲與岳新民·張寶匯共同爲違背職務之行爲，而張淵與之共犯，已足認定。况利豐永之顏料數批，或與原許可證內所列貨品名稱不符，或借用別家商號之許可證，或根本無許可證，民富之顏料及工衆原料六十噸，係偕用金山公司之許可證，燒碱六〇五桶，且無許可證，竟因記由陳良絅商得張淵同意，即在上述許可證內，加添燒碱項目，天和大康合運顏料六十四桶抵滬，僅有提單及買賣合同，並無進口許可證，益豐之羊毛十五萬噸運滬，其量超出證載額數倍，又已逾證載限期，均在不許進口之列，已由楊樹德·陳良絅，張淵陳述明白，並有卷附各證，證實明確，乃該被告猶辯稱「奸商太壞，種種朦蔽，不易核對出來」云云。果如所云，何以在張淵未接受賄款前，一概留難抑壓，而於張淵過付賄款以後，均得提前簽准，又何得於病假中，仍將賄款致送其家，又何得向卸職離開賦閑淞滬之同事張淵，借六千萬元之多，得因平日帮忙之故，免除其償還之賣，其爲勾通張淵在外過付，在外接洽，於茲可見。是以無論次數若干，其先後共同違背職務之犯意，已屬概括一貫，毫無疑義，自當認爲連續犯罪。</p>
<p>（二）被告岳民部分</p>
<p>查該被告對於怡舉行之鍍鋅鐵片，利豐永行之安尼林油等，天和大康兩行之顏料，益豐行之羊毛，及民富行之餌料燒碱，均先後通融，提前進口各節，其自白各詞，不無囫圇之處，但經本院訊據，略稱「先後分受怡豐民富兩行各送美金三千元，陸續又分了法幣兩三千萬元，確數記不淸，尹蘭蓀很守秘密，得上司信用，有事都由張淵轉達本人，不能與他直接說話」各等語，核與曾在國防部保密局及本院檢察處偵查中，凡各共犯及該被告先後陳述，與其自白書（見局卷第一册六八至七〇頁）大致相符，再參以卷附各證件，其爲與尹蘭蓀等共同實施犯罪無疑。茲再就此部分與所犯他案，是否出於概括犯意一節，論斷之，據稱「張高振託我，尹蘭蓀張高振等都壞，不要與他往來，我即將東西（指發票提單及許可證等件），退給張高振了，後來張高振說梅福堂已允送八千元美金，經尹主任答應了，才做的，我得美金三千元，他們三人（指張淵·岳新民·張寶匯）各分美金一千五百元，餘作零用」，證以張高振所稱「如不給八千元美金即不發單子」，其爲共同藉端勒索財物無疑，則此部分既與所犯連續對於違背職務收受賄賂罪名不同，而造意又係出於該被告個人，當然不能認出於概括犯意，自應各別論處。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄　（十二）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>權衡輕重不得不出此下策</p>
<p>雷諾總理在墨索里尼宣戰後數小時偕其政府　要離開巴黎之前，　電報打一個戲劇性的呼籲給羅斯福總統，要求他公開宣布美國除不派遠征軍外將以一切方法支持協約國。</p>
<p>他說，「我們將在巴黎之前作戰，我們將在巴黎之後作戰。我們將局處於一省中作戰，假如我們被逐出該省，則將在北非立足繼續作戰，設有需要，將在我們在美洲的領地作戰。」</p>
<p>總理和我知道法國人是既不能在巴黎之前作戰，亦不能在巴黎之後作戰，亦不能局處於一省中作戰。（雷諾所想到的是不列侖尼省。）但是法國還可以保持對艦隊的控制，撤退到北非，而在那裏繼續作戰。</p>
<p>我們雖有世界上最好的善意和意同，但是也知道我們在援助法國方面是有物質的和政治的限度的。法國之戰，事實上巳告完畢，我們簡直無法可以阻止希特勒征服法國。所以我們就設法發出一個答覆，以謀鼓勵雷諾和他的政府在北非繼續作戰，並且保持法國艦隊的完整。</p>
<p>德軍於七月十四日佔領巴黎，在總統發出答覆的前一日。蒲立特大使協助軍人市長把這個未予防守的城市移交給德國人，並未塗炭生靈。蒲立特依照他自己的意思，留在後面，而未與法國政府一同到多爾其後再到波爾多去。他以爲在德軍佔領之下留在巴黎（至少暫時）比和法國政府一同逃亡對於協約國和巴黎民衆可以有更多的貢獻。他的腦筋中記着美國大使漢里克的行動，後者在第一次世界大戰期間是留在巴黎的，並未和法國政府一同到波爾多去。</p>
<p>在我看來，這個決定是不幸的。在六月十日法國政府離開巴黎到六月十七日它要求停戰這緊急的一星期中，蒲立特無法和法國政府保持任何接觸。假如蒲立特能在道些具有歷史性的時日中能代表我們，那麼以他和法國政府領袖無比的密切關係，可能使這個政府帶了艦隊到北非去，從那裏繼續作戰的。</p>
<p>蒲立特的位置由皮德爾大使繼任，他先前在巴黎時是我們駐波蘭流亡政府的代表。皮德爾是一位優秀的外交家。但是以他對法國政府的關係和影嚮而言，是不能和蒲立特相比擬的。</p>
<p>當德軍進抵巴黎之時，蒲立特和總統直接通報，因爲他知道國務院對他即將提出的建議是會反對的。所以他和總枕親自接觸。於是他建議留在巴黎，不與法國政府同走。</p>
<p>蒲立特用電話和電報直接和總統通訊的情形有好多次。他還定了一個私人的密碼，專門和總統擬好的。這種辦法的運用，在法國失敗的悲痛時日中達到了最高峯。結果是國務院有時候對蒲立特所想的和所做的茫無所知，雖然總統通知我從蒲立特那裏來的許多消息並在我就某一特殊問題提出詢問時，他總供給我充份的情報的。羅斯福先生喜歡外交工作上戲劇性的一面，因而並不反對此種辦法。</p>
<p>當我知這了蒲立特的建議之後，我就去看總統。我對他說我反對這個辦法，認爲我們的大使應該和法國政府一起走。在我看來，蒲立特對德軍在巴黎的佔領當局的影嚮是極小的，因爲他堅強的反納粹情緒向爲德國政府所深知。但在另一方面，他對法國政府的影嚮，可能有決定的作用。</p>
<p>於是總統就親自打電話給蒲立特。他對大使說他（總統）和我認爲他應該和法國政府一起離開巴黎。他所提出的論據，就是蒲立特可能被共產黨或者納粹份子所暗殺，因爲他長同爲兩者所憎恨的。蒲立特說他不能逃避危險，竭力爭辯，終使總統放棄了反對。　在多爾，其後在波爾多，皮德爾大使維續此項奮鬥，曾去看雷諾，貝當，海軍部長達朗海軍上將，達拉第和其他人十，一再向他們申述我們的見解，就是說法國在它的海軍尚告完整的情形之下，應該繼續抵抗。皮德爾的電訊，對於法國內閣內部的爭執情形，提供了生動的叙述，當時雷諾反對停戰，貝當贊成停戰，而在內閣之外，惡劣向賴伐爾則已開始運用他的勢力準備投降了。</p>
<p>於是在六月十六日夜，雷諾辭職，貝當組織新內閣，由蒲杜安担任外長，達朗海軍上將担任海軍部長，設法停戰。</p>
<p>英國和美國政府奮力想保障法國海軍的安全。邱吉爾派他的海軍部長，他的第一海軍大臣，他的殖民大臣到波爾多去代表他。我和總統商討局勞之後，向皮德爾大使發出了在我事業上是最強硬的電報之一，呌他向貝當政府轉達。</p>
<p>我說，「總統希望你說，就是根據我國政府的意見，假如法國政府在與德國人簽訂任何停戰協定之前不能注意到它的艦隊不致落入對方之手，那麼法國政府對於法國帝國的保持以及法國獨立與自主的最後恢復將造成嚴重的損害。更有進者，假如法國政府不能採取此等步驟而准許法國艦隊向德國投降，那麼法國政府將永遠失却美國政府的友誼和善意」。</p>
<p>這個文告是近乎魯莽的，但是局勢如此，僅有一個強硬的文告或可發生一些作用。</p>
<p>六月十八日，當達朗即將去出席內閣會議時，皮爾把這份電報交給他。皮德爾　在閣議正在舉行時去訪問蒲杜安，給他一個副本。雖然在皮德爾看來，蒲杜安對於照會中措辭的激烈顯極憤怒，但是他和達朗還是把它放在內閣之前。政府繼即決定在任何情形之下艦隊決不移交給德國人，假如海軍投降包括在德方條件之中，停戰應予拒絕。</p>
<p>法國艦隊並不是我們唯一關心的東西。我們也關心對於英國艦隊可能發生的事情。現在，法國是巳經屈服了，希特勒可以轉移其全部力量來對付英國了。總統和我，相信英國可以並且將能够順利地抵抗納粹的進攻，但是在美洲和歐洲，有許多人和貝當及其類似人物持有相同的見解，認爲英國將在數星期內被征服或媾和。</p>
<p>當英國大使洛齊安在六月十一日來看我的時候，他說從邱吉爾那裏接到了一個建議，主張由我們兩國政府的海軍官員舉行參謀會議，商討有關大西洋和太平洋的艦隊移動。我回答說我懷疑是否有舉行參謀會議。機會，但是我樂於將這個建議向總統轉達。</p>
<p>洛齊安問我他　軍事參贊能否和陸軍部的適當官員商討關於英法轟炸德國內部的效果·我說我確信我們的軍事人員在能力範圍之內將樂於以任何情報供給他　軍事參贊，雖然我們不能從事於此類情報的交換。其後，我就設法使他的軍事參贊就此一問題和陸軍部商討，並且要求我們駐德國的使領官員隨時通知我們英方轟炸德國的結果。</p>
<p>六月二十四日，我再和洛齊安談論英國艦隊的安排問題。他重又提出建議，主張我們兩國政府的適當陸海軍官員舉行參謀會議。假如一旦英國政府必須帶了它剩餘的艦隊退到加拿大來，這種會議是極為重要的。但是這須在英國失敗的情形之下始能發生，而當時洛齊安和我根本沒有想到這一點。</p>
<p>我指出至少在這個階段，交換情報還是以經由外交官員較經由陸海軍官員爲宜。總統和我所關心的，乃是舉行軍事參謀會議的消息可能「漏出去」，而使反對政府者以及孤立主議省可以借此指責總統正設法使美國加入戰爭。</p>
<p>法國艦隊問題一個　劇性的解決，終於在七月三日到來了，雖然解法是僅屬部份的。當時英方接收了停留在英國港口的法國軍艦，他們通知在亞歴山大指揮一個編隊的法國海軍上將說，假如他想把它們帶到法國去而使它們落入德方控制之下，他們將予以擊沉。他們還　一個哀的美敦書送給在北非奧朗附近的梅　爾凱勃指揮着法國艦隊一大部份的一個法國海軍上將。哀的美敦需要求在梅賽爾凱勃的法國軍艦參加英國艦隊，不然就開到英國，或西印度或者美國的港口被拘留起來。當法國海軍上將拒絕之時，英方當即開火，使大多數的法國船隻失却效能，擊斃法國人一千名以上。　對於英法之間這種悲劇性的破裂，我感到說不出的悲痛，不能自禁。</p>
<p>一年半之後，將近一九四一年十二月底，邱吉爾先生正來訪問總統。在總統招待這位貴賓的某次宴席上，我坐在首相和一位英國海軍上將之間。這位海軍上將問　　於英方在奧朗攻擊法國艦隊的感想如何。我閃選這個問題，因爲我不願　在他和邱吉爾先生之間引起爭論，其理由是我曾聽到英國海軍曾反對進以，英國政府內部曾發生相當重大的意見分歧　可是在幾分鐘之後，我和邱吉爾先生本人提起這個題目。他　括地說維希政府是不能信任的，假如已予攻擊，它會把艦隊移交給德國人的。他並且說當時英國的威信正在最低潮，他想靠此一行動來在全世界提高它，表示英國還是要作戰的。</p>
<p>蒲立特在德軍進駐數日之後離開巴黎，於七月四日在維希會晤貝當，賴伐爾，蒲杜安和其他人物，這一天適爲英國攻擊法國艦隊的下一日。他在五日打電報給我說，他們的反應極端激烈。若干閣員主張立即和英國作戰，但是貝當對超過斷絕外交關係的任何行動表示堅決反對。貝當說，唯有在希特勒被某一其他國家所擊敗時，始能使法國恢復獨立，所以他誠懇希望英國獲勝。他想减輕和英國破裂的嚴重性，說這是由於邱吉爾個人未能權衡輕重所致。</p>
<h3>一貼苦藥　美國老百姓　上杜魯門</h3>
<p>〔本報紐約三日航訊〕別萊魯斯（Billy　Rose）是一個打字員出身，手法敏捷，現在仍保持全世界高速度紀錄。在第一次世界大戰時，他是巴魯徹的秘書，此後，他做過很多的行業，特別是在百老匯游藝界中，頗露頭角。他在紐約世界博覽會中的表演節目，尤爲人所稱道。除了表演之外，他所經營的「金鋼鑽馬蹄」夜總會，尤負時譽。他收入極豐，發了許多財。最近，他從事著作，每星期要寫上五欄之多哩。下面所譯，是他近來的信札之一由此可以看到美國的老百姓跟總統是保持着多麼親切的關係。</p>
<p>親愛的總統。從我所處的地位看起來，那些選舉人似乎不預備讓您在那本雪凡尼街公寓裏繼續租賃下去，每個人都在把握某一目標，當他們把握的時候，正如在上次選舉時所見到的情形一樣，他們投票選舉了另外一個人。　總統先生，我寫信給您的原因，是爲了我願意您繼續住在白宮裏，您在我看保，不失爲</p>
<p>一個好人</p>
<p>，我想您是懷有好意的。我猜想國人對於您大概抱有同樣的觀感。但是說句坦白的話，我們大家多少感到些惴惴不安。我們知道我們的國家多少有一些毛病，雖然我們不知道那毛病究竟在什麼地方。當您生病時，您的情緒不會很好的，您需要一個懂得對症發藥的醫生。</p>
<p>這封信的目的，就是要向您建議召請這樣的一個醫生，把他請到白宮里面來，當政體違和時，隨時可以開一張方子醫治一下。而國人所相信的這種醫生祗有一位。他便是我們的老友巴魯徵先生。他按着國家的脈搏，告訴我們爲什麼它跳得太快或者太慢，足足已有三十年了。不辛他</p>
<p>所開藥方</p>
<p>，我們沒有一一服用，因爲那位老醫生，認爲必要的時候就會開出一貼難吃的苦藥的。　如果那位老先生住在您隔壁　室裏的消息傳出去以後，對於一般民氣一定大有振作，對於您的政治機會亦莫不然。我想杜魯門夫人也下見得會反對的。巴魯徹先生是一個很合潮流的公民，具有南方人的姿態，看樣子是和善的。他不喝酒，從不把烟灰丟在地毯上，給付小賬，夙以慷慨著稱的。我想，他一定能增加您的聲望的。</p>
<p>我知道您一定同意的，如果過去兩個月裏那位老醫生在您手邊，您一定會感到很方便。您要在國會中發表一年一度的</p>
<p>聯邦演說</p>
<p>這對於任何總統是一篇重要的演說。無疑的，您和白宮裏的幕僚們通宵草擬這一篇演說稿。試問你們集體努力的結果怎麼樣？一個很笨拙的建議，對於下次大選時投票選舉您的人一律給以四十元。這好像告訴一個患有癌症的病人，呌他每逢下雨天吃一片阿斯匹靈一樣。</p>
<p>在您發表演說以後數天，參院外交委員會向巴魯徹博士微詢他對於馬歇爾計劃以及其他若干問題徵詢他作何感想。我們這位老政治家便提出了一個詳細縝密的世界復與計劃。雖則寥寥三千字，他告訢我們關於通貨膨脹，物價，工資和其他</p>
<p>世界問題</p>
<p>的處理方案。公佈他的藥方的唯一報紙是「華爾街日報」，它使你覺得巴魯徵是怎樣高明的一位醫生！</p>
<p>但是言歸正傳，再說那位老醫生住在白宮裏的這回事。如果在過去兩個月中您和他一同喝橘子水，大概那巴魯徹計劃現在已經變成杜魯門計劃了。</p>
<p>關於這位老醫生對於白宮如何可貴這一點，讓我再舉一個例子來說明一下。最近因爲您欲在白宮裏建造</p>
<p>一座陽臺</p>
<p>許多人起來反對您。假如巴魯徹先生和您住在一起的話，您的事情就方便多了。「我們需要這座陽臺，爲的我們的老朋友可以坐在那裏晒太腸，替我們運思設計。」這一個理由已經很足够，甚至於有許多信仰這位醫生的百姓自願供給木材釘子，堅持要建築那座陽臺。</p>
<p>是不是我建議您不要重用現在帮助您的白宮裏的這輩聰明伶俐的後生小子呢？絕對不是。我曾經見過他們的照片，他們好像都是好小子。事實上，巴魯徹先生進來以後，他們也會感到方便的，。這位老醫生很喜歡巧克力蘇打水，在暑天裏，旁的同事一定樂於到藥房裏去替他買一瓶。　總統先生，請您想一想吧，如果您自己到藥房裏去跑一趟，您或許會得到許多選票的。</p>
<h3>東北狼煙千里　工礦深陷險境</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十日航訊〕東北礦藏在亞洲佔着最炫耀的地位，是中國工業發展的基礎，東北是中國的生命綫，這不僅是情感的呼號，實在是理智的理論。不幸光復後首經蘇軍拆遷百分之七十的工礦設備，殘餘部份繼經共匪竄擾破壞，損害更鉅，迄今兩年半，東北工礦日益萎縮，今天已到風雨飄搖的地步，國人應該急起扭轉這歷史的逆流</p>
<p>搶救東北工礦，首要問題便是戡亂，因爲這是醫療工礦瘡痛的消毒工作，工礦事業唯有在安定中才能生存。目前東北千里狼烟，匪患未已，工礦事業處境險惡萬分。拋開民營工礦所遭的厄運不談，即以國營工礦而言，資源委員會在東北所經營的</p>
<p>輕重工礦業</p>
<p>包括廿六個單位，均於卅五年十月以後分別成立，開工生產，迅謀恢復，欣欣向榮，至卅六年五月，已恢復至相當程度，前途希望甚大，惜該年五月以後匪患猖獗，工礦事業首當其害，均損失甚重，創痛日深。迄目前各礦爲環境所迫，多數無法繼續生產，不能「坐吃山空」，乃有緊縮裁員之決定，依照各礦現狀，分別爲繼續開工，維持現狀，暫行保管，正待復工，裁撤機構等五種狀態：</p>
<p>繼續開工者</p>
<p>計有撫順礦務局，東北電力局（撫順及豐滿兩發電所），本溪煤鐵公司，瀋陽機車車輛製造公司，瀋陽橡膠廠（膠一鞋，膠帶，汽車膠胎三廠）及電訊事務所東北區等六單位。</p>
<p>維持現狀者</p>
<p>有中央機器公司　陽機器廠，（該廠原來經營情形爲各單位中最佳者，現產品無銷路），瀋陽製車廠，中央電工器材廠，（僅開電機修理工塲），瀋陽化工廠，（產品燒鹼鹽酸銷路停滯），流寗水泥公司，（僅本溪一廠在工作中），旱新煤礦公司等六單位。</p>
<p>暫行保管者</p>
<p>有北票煤礦公司（錦州），營城四礦接收委員會（長春），烟台煤礦（藩陽），按山鋼鐵公司，東北金屬礦業公司，中央絕綠器材公司撫順廠，中國石油公司東北爛油廠（錦西）遼寧紙漿造紙公司，華北水泥公司（錦西）等九單位。</p>
<p>裁撤之機構</p>
<p>計有西安煤礦公司材料事務所東北分所，保險事務所瀋陽分所等三單位。</p>
<p>正待復工者計有葫蘆島硫酸廠，硫酸爲化學工業之母，該廠過去停工原因，係以運輸困難及產品缺少容器所致。現此二項問題解法，即將恢復生產。</p>
<p>以上是戰爭搖籃裘東北工礦的眞面目，且莫忽視了今天的危機，以及它對於未來的影嚮。傅孟眞先生說過：「有東北，中國好比印度，無東北，中國只是義大利。」實在是警惕之言。斐文中教授考察西北歸來，曾著文發抒他的感想，認爲國人對工業建設的視綫，應由東北轉移到西北去，他這種一收之桑榆」的見解，甚難爲了解東北資源的人所苟同試問由東北南去的工程師便知。今天我們痛惜的不但是工礦設備的遭受蹂躪，工程人才的戕害，尤爲無法彌補的損失。（本報記者趙展）</p>

<p>鄧氏以情形嚴重，即報請省會警備司令部偵訊，經該部稽查處詳細研究，以匪徒綁票，竟敢在市區最繁華區域贖票取款，必係巨帮匪徒無疑，遂調集全部偵緝大隊，出動機槍及新式武器數百挺，當晚數百人將甲山公園緊密包圍埋伏。並由鄧氏以小鈔紮成億元模樣，潛置碑側，引匪入　。入夜，果見短小黑影潛入園中，在碑側徘徊再四後，以手電筒向碑頂巨鐘照射三次。於是晴號一聲，伏兵齊出，立將該匪擒獲，發現此巨匪蓋僅一着麻灰學生制服，背揹書包全身學生裝，年僅十四五齡之中學生，在衆人駭異之下，當帶該匪入部訊問。渠堅不吐實情，僅云：流浪無依，生活無着，不能讀書，迫而出此下策。事既至此，請槍斃謝法等語。嗣經警部嚴司令善言勸誘，始供稱名鮑育林，在銘章中學初中部肄業，肥票現在靜安別墅（蓉市最繁華旅館）等語。旋由該部午夜派幹警多人至該旅館搜查，果請獲事主鄧永保及執槍者守肥票之另一穉氣可掬之青年學生匪犯，該生年僅十三四齡，爲育林之弟鮑育智</p>
<p>安請離奇</p>
<p>全案破獲後，又經警部嚴密偵訊，根據三人口供，詳情爲：鮑生兄弟，均籍浙江，抗戰隨父母流浪來川，年前父母雙亡，即流蕩蓉市。鄧生與鮑兄弟去歲會在銘章中學同學，但已半年未通音訊。二十九日鮑育林突訪鄧生，諉稱家中匯款五千萬來蓉，託鄧代儲入可靠銀行。次日，復邀鄧到蓉光劇院觀一龍虎大偵探」一片，觀後又邀鄧到靜安別墅渠所開之房間一遊，遽甫入室，鮑育智突由秣後掩出，一手執槍禁鄧聲張，一手執有「哥羅方」之手帕一張，使鄧昏迷半嚮，甦醒後，即迫鄧親筆書購票書，終致彼捕。</p>
<p>藍本多種</p>
<p>警部於搜查鮑兄弟房間時，曾搜獲手槍一支，「哥羅方」一瓶，另偵探小說數本，「騙術大觀」一部，據稱此爲年靑匪犯佈置此曲折綁案之藍本。</p>
<p>案情大白後，輿論界認此爲學風低落及社會教育破產所種因，對教育當局，一致抨擊，同時，警部對此尚未成年之青年罪犯，判刑頗爲棘手，或將移送法院辦理。又另一說，以票主鄧永保，平日品行學業，均極低劣，可能爲串通自綁，但鄧家及警部均堅決否認。</p>

<h3>防清寒學生淆惑　李熙謀發表談話　清寒同學聯會　查係非法織</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近有所謂淸寒同學聯合會者，時在報端發表消息，記者特以此走詢市教育局長李熙謀，承發表談話如下：「所謂清寒同學聯合會，本局亦祗在報端，獲見該項名稱。經詳細調查，本市淸寒學生曾受統一獎金及學校免費者，既無此項團體之組織，社會局方面亦未見該團體前往申請登記，顯係少數別有用心份子之非法組織可知。至該會所稱，下星期小學學費將達二百五十萬元以上云云，更係嚮壁　構，冀　淆惑　　。因私校收費，刻尚未決定，本局深信各校當局必能體　家長負祖，規定合理數字。至各校百分之二十五免費額，係的市參議會決定後，各校均已接受實行，在各校總收入中並已加入計算，不影嚮教師待遇，固毋須再右變動。統一獎學金，係社會熱心人士共同捐集，自當依照實際收數，隨時提高名額，不必淸寒學生提出額外要求。本市清寒學生不能獲得减免者，更可申請統一獎金。如此則無力負担學費者，已均可獲得救助，不至再這失學之處。至所謂私校教師不能得實物配給，此係行政院規定，通行全國，本市當未便獨異，且更與淸寒學生風馬牛不相及。粽觀所謂淸寒學生聯合會發言人所云，大都係動人聽聞之口號，不顧實際情况，甚至前後矛盾，深信各校清塞學生必不致受其淆惑，以遂其操縱利用之野心」云。</p>
<h3>華西大學　學生人數</h3>
<p>居十三教會大學首位</p>
<p>〔神州社訊〕本市中華基督教教育協會，最近發表全國十三教會大學教職員學生人數，授課時數，男女生比例，各項戰前戰後的數字統計。關於各大學學生戰後增加與戰前比較統計如下：</p>
<p>名稱　戰前人數　戰後人數</p>
<p>燕京　八二四　七九七</p>
<p>齊魯　六五九　五八七</p>
<p>金陵　九三〇　一·一一六</p>
<p>金女大　二五九　三四一</p>
<p>東吳　八〇〇　一·二三八</p>
<p>聖約翰　六一一　一·七四四</p>
<p>之江　五二八　八七四</p>
<p>滬江　一·一五〇　一·五三四</p>
<p>華中　一九二　四四七</p>
<p>華西　三九三　二·〇八三</p>
<p>協和　一七四　六〇一</p>
<p>華南　一〇〇　二二三</p>
<p>南　四五〇　一·〇〇五</p>
<p>一般結論，顯示：（一）除燕京與齊魯兩大學因自成都遷回原址，學生數因交通關係略爲減少外，其餘各大學學生增加甚多，尤以華西大學二·〇八三人爲各校之冠，本市約大一·七四四人居第二位。（二）華南女大與金女大學較少，當設法與比鄰大學合作共設科系，以减少經濟責任，金女大與金大，已有如此合作辦法。（三）員生比例，戰後均顯著增加，平均爲一比九·六。</p>

<h3>今晚籃球聯賽　華聯再逢汕耿　晚七時半在市體育館</h3>

<p>印第安—晨白（甲二A）五時半</p>
<p>西青綠—甲申（甲二B）六時半</p>
<p>華聯—油隊（甲一組）七時半</p>
<p>晨白對印第安之戰，兩隊在該組中，對錦標前途，均巳無問鼎希望，且雙方亦同樣棄權一次，故積分相等，勝負與大局無關，盼兩隊始終保持運動精神，勿以勝負爲前題。　次幕甲申逢西青綠，甲申在甲二B組中，領導羣雄，保持不敗，分組冠軍，巳如探囊取物。惟西青綠在恩卡斯之扶掖下，戰法新穎，長力充沛，甲申如欲保持常勝，屆時必須謹慎從事，而以全力出發。甲申戰将，皆爲年輕力壯，富有經驗者，如王介平·陶榮石等，屆時當可痛擊番兵，高奏凱歌。</p>
<p>聯戰甲一組常勝軍華聯迎戰油隊，於七時半開始，第一循環中，雙方遭遇，結果汕隊敗北，今晚再度相逢，汕隊自　報復，惟實力相差甚遠，屆時決難對抗，惟一希汕隊少輸分而已。華聯近况更見佳妙，自戰勝大公新軍後，練習更動，對　票皇座，抱有蟬聯雄心，今晚主將李震中已離滬赴杭，然全隊陣容，依然整齊，遇油除仍可發揮威力，予以迎頭痛擊。</p>
<p>（華聯）李震中·包松圓·吳成章·陳學崇·任相成·劉福善·秦循則·張良雄·梁學齡·孔廣益。</p>

<h3>埠際足球第三戰　滬隊今對港西聯</h3>

<p>力奇（香港會）</p>
<p>菲士達（香港會）</p>
<p>吿山奴（聖約瑟）</p>
<p>巴榮（海軍）</p>
<p>花留（香港會）</p>
<p>晏德臣（空軍）</p>
<p>奧馬（聖約瑟）</p>
<p>基納（燕尼斯）</p>
<p>蕭番洛（空軍）</p>
<p>根寗海（巴夫）</p>
<p>雪維亞（聖約瑟）</p>
<p>（生力軍）威利（砲兵）加拉赫（砲兵）告拉素（警察）　上海隊出塲名單，則因孫錦順負傷之故，前鋒綫將與戰華聯之役相同，中衛三將，可能仍由韓，孟，高，出塲，鐵伏尼愛德華或將一試，嚴士鑫之後衛，將由陳家萬出陣，吳祺祥與張邦綸無變動，雙方實力，滬隊較爲整齊，勝利誰屬，一般預測，上海可勝。</p>
<h3>廿一屆埠際足球賽　上海隊空前慘敗記　香港隊用三個人釘住小黃毛　張邦綸風頭健救了不少險球</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕香港隊超人的速度，純熟的聯絡，和準確的射門，第廿一屆滬港埠際足球賽，結果上海隊以一比五遭逢空前的慘敗。上海隊的幾位健將，未能到達平時的水準，以致在告山奴率領下的香港隊，很容易的得了勝仗。</p>
<p>上海隊</p>
<p>張邦輪</p>
<p>嚴士鑫　吳祺祥</p>
<p>韓龍波　瞿永福　高保正</p>
<p>李　　孫錦順　勞勃司托夫　夏體先　費春華</p>
<p>香港隊</p>
<p>譚均幹</p>
<p>高山龍　侯榕生</p>
<p>張金海　花留　劉松生</p>
<p>朱永強　基亞能　鄧宜杰　鄒文治　何應芬</p>
<p>半點鐘前趕到球場</p>
<p>幸運之神未曾降落在上海隊的陣前。主將勞勃斯托夫，在比賽前半小時，才由上海飛到香港，匆匆忙忙趕到球塲，連氣都喘不過來。祗有幾分鐘的練習，當然是不够的。但是他還是很努力作戰。因爲他的英名香港人早已耳熟能詳，上一屆的比賽，他獨中了上海隊方面所獲的二球，所以這次用三個大將，看住了他，使他無法施展，否則情形不致壞得如此。香港隊當然是踢得好，但是也因爲上海隊的失常。</p>
<p>比賽在農曆元旦星期二下午在快活谷舉行，觀衆約計八千人，許多買不到票子的朋友，都站在屋頂上，山坡上觀戰，盛極一時。</p>
<p>天時佳麗，塲地因雨後稍濘。上海隊白衣藍褲首先登塲，香港隊藍衣白褲。下午三時半在高奏中英國歌聲中，開始比賽。港督與球員一一握手，裁判員鳴笛開戰。</p>
<p>滬隊失落黃金機會</p>
<p>港隊開球，侵入滬隊陣地，吳祺祥一脚遠球，逐退港軍。上海隊反攻，迫成角球，毫無成就。在第四分鐘時，上海隊得一黃金機會，全軍攻抵港隊門前，費春華一脚軟球，向右逸去，深爲可惜。再度進攻，勞勃斯托夫傳孫錦順，鐵腿射球過準，適落譚均幹之手。二度良機，當時如獲成功，局面當然大變。</p>
<p>二次進攻不成，港隊亦見進逼，而滬隊聯絡漸見散漫，甚至全軍瓦解。港隊進攻，形勢危急，張邦綸趕出在外，祗剩一座空門，惜鄧宜杰竟一飛冲天。</p>
<p>香港隊連中了二球</p>
<p>第十四分鐘港隊右內鋒鄒文治，一記遠球，卒告成功，飛入滬隊網角，脚頭淸脆美妙，張邦綸竟無法挽救。五分鐘少後，港隊得由第二球。張邦綸瞿永福自己互撞倒地，留得空門，鄧宜杰如失羈之馬，一蹴進網。</p>
<p>香港隊既連勝二球，信心增加，全軍振作，控制全場。嚴士鑫受裁判員警告，以踢法危險，上海隊受罰一記槍籬笆球，未有所失。</p>
<p>好容易費春華還中</p>
<p>直至第三十九分鐘，上海隊得中全局惟一寶貴之一球。吳祺祥一脚遠球，直送夏體先，夏向右翼費春華轉送，小費直衝門口，低球一脚，居然中的。一球挽回，全軍奮起，惜僅曇花一現，港隊前鋒，節節進逼，張邦綸應接不暇。上半時港隊二比一佔先。</p>
<p>吳祺祥被罰十二碼</p>
<p>下半時港隊益見銳利，上海陣地，滿佈敵騎，攻勢猛烈。鄒文治何應芬在右　進攻，滬隊忙於防禦，左面頓開漏洞，港隊左內鋒基亞能，遂攻入第三球。</p>
<p>僅僅二分鐘後，吳祺祥被罰十二碼，鄒文治踢入，比數已成四比一，上海隊大勢去矣。</p>
<p>係錦順左腿受了傷</p>
<p>上海隊禍不單打，隊長孫錦順左腿受傷，退移塲外。此外滬隊在港比賽，老孫已不能再參加。上海隊偶有進攻，徒成點綴。勞勃斯托夫獲得一頂，亦未中的。港隊前鋒之美妙合作，中鋒鄧宜杰卒在門前八碼之處攻入第五球。時間尚餘五分鐘，觀衆已紛紛離去，對上海隊大表失望。　如果不是張邦綸的努力救險，上海隊恐尚輸得不止此數。上海隊大失常態，但全隊確已盡其全力，香港隊速度過高，深感難於應付也。</p>

<h3>一九四七年之英國對外貿易</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者本耿</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>對外貿易，是英國整個經濟問題中很重要的部份。現在我們來看一看一九四七年英國對外貿易的情況：</p>
<p>下面的數字，表示一九四七年的劉外貿易及其與一九三八（戰前）一九四六兩年的比較。（單位千英鎊）。</p>
<p>年次　入口　本國貨物出口　進口貨之再出口　入超</p>
<p>一九三八　九一九、五〇九　四七〇、七五三　六一、三二三　五八七、二二九</p>
<p>一九四六　一、五〇一、〇三〇　九一四、六九九　五〇、二六九　三三六、〇六二</p>
<p>一九四七　一、七八七、四七一　一、一五七、〇八三　五九、二六七　五九一、二二一</p>
<p>英國素來在對外貿易方面，是一個入超的國家。一九四七年的出口數字，據統計是一九二〇年以來最多的一年，並且是一九三八年之兩倍半。但是這是就英鎊價值而言，在實際上，由於物價的上漲，出口貨的數量，並沒有增加如是之多。目下這種物價上漲詳情，尚未公布。但據估計，一九四七年的出口，在貨物的數量來講，大約是一九三八年數量之百分的一百零八。換言之，所增加者，不到十分之一。英國的目的，要將出口數量提高到一九三八年的百分之一百四十，因爲必需這樣，英國才能有適量的入口，以提高人民的生活水準。如由一九四七年這一年情形看來，各季的情形不盡相同，約如次：（單位千英鎊）</p>
<p>季次　入口　本國貨物出口　進口貨之再出口　入超</p>
<p>第一季　三六三六五〇　二四九六五九　一八一九七　九五七九四</p>
<p>第二季　四五五五一八　二六四八七六　一七七七〇　一七二八七二</p>
<p>第三季　五一七三九八　三〇二四四九　二一三一　二〇三八一八</p>
<p>第四季　四五〇九〇五　三二〇〇九九　一二〇六九　二八七三七</p>
<p>由上表看來，在此四季之中，最末一季之入超有减低趨勢。據統計，一九四六年第四季之出口貨的量爲一九三八年的百分之一百十一，一九四七年第一季跌到百分之一百零一，第二季爲百分之一百零二，第三季爲百分之一百十四，第四季爲百分之一百十七。換言之一九四七年整年之出口貨量，雖則只爲一九三八年百分之一百零八，但是其主要原因乃由第一二兩季數字太低。而茶一季數字之特低，據一般說法，與一九四七年最初三個月英國氣候特冷，同時發生煤荒，，第四以致影嚮運輸，然影嚮了去年整年的出口。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>至於進出口貨物的種類興復偉，亦可一看。先看進口貨在一九四七年的情形，及其與一九三八一九四六兩年的比較·（單位千英鎊）</p>
<p>貨物種類　一九三八　一九四六　一九四七</p>
<p>食緝烟草飲料　四三〇一一七　六三七四七八　八〇五四二七</p>
<p>原料及非製成品　二四八二一三　三九〇二一八　五五九八二三</p>
<p>製成品及大半製成品　二三三五二二　二四五二七一　三九九四二四</p>
<p>動物之不作爲食糧者　三三一八　七一四五　七七二六</p>
<p>郵包進口者　四三三九　二〇九一八　一五〇七一</p>
<p>由於上表，可以知道英國的進口貨，以食糧烟草飲料佔大宗，這也就是英國入超問題難以解決的主要原因所在。食糧是絕對必需品，但就一九四七年各季之情形言之，食糧烟草飲料之入口，亦有减少之勢。第一季每月平均之入口爲六一五五七千英鎊，第二季爲七一三二一千英鎊，第三季為七六二〇二千英鎊，但第四季減低至五九三九五千英鎊。（按上述各季數字，乃食糧煙草飮料各該季每月平均之入口數字）</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>出口貨物之情形如次：（單位　千英鎊）</p>
<p>貨物種類　一九三八　一九四六　一九四七</p>
<p>食糧飲料烟草　三五八〇三　六三六八四　六四七二五</p>
<p>原料及非製成品　五六九二一　三三〇一三　三四二〇七</p>
<p>製成品及大半製成品三六五二四五　七八九一一〇　九九八八七七</p>
<p>動物之不作爲食料者　六七九　三七五八　三七五八　三五七四</p>
<p>郵包出口者　一二〇一七　二五一三四　三五七〇〇</p>
<p>出口之情形與進口相反，出口乃以製成品及大半製成品爲主，而第一項（食糧飲料烟草）與第二項（原料及非製成品）出口之數量，在比較上，不佔重要之地位。這種情形，也表示英國是一個工業國。但是一個工業國，人民生活水準已經提到很高的程度，而又缺乏食糧，其困難情形是不難想像的。我們由於上表，也可以看出英國經濟問題之解決，尚有待於努力。（按，本文數字，係根據英國商務局本年一月廿四日出版之Board　of　Trade　Joumal第一五四卷第二六六六號。本文所報告者爲進出口之價值方面，在物價時有變動之下，進出口貨物之數量方面，自甚重要，一俟當局發表，當再另爲報告。）（一九四八年一月廿七夜倫敦。）</p>

<h3>論彝銘中的「休」字</h3>
<p>— 唐蘭</p>
<p>三十六年春，大公報文史周刊十三期，有楊遇夫先生的『詩對揚王休解』，據金文休字用例，糾鄧箋休美之訓，及宋以來金文家之誤釋。他說鄭康成把休字解爲美，『文義膚泛不切』，他解釋做賜與，對揚王休，即答揚王賜。古音休與好同，好也是賜與。又根據金文，設五證來證明休應解爲賜與。</p>
<p>我認爲楊先生的結論，下得太快了一些。「休」字在有些地方固然可以解釋做賜與，但不能到處用這個解釋。一個字的意義，是有多面性的。一般訓詁學家的毛病，往往把字義看成各個獨立的，死板的，而不去綜合起來。同是一個「好」字，解釋做「美也」，或解爲「賜與」，好像其間絕無關聯似的。楊先生說：</p>
<p>休當讀爲好，詩小雅大（小）明云：「好是正直』，鄧箋云：「好猶與也」。左傳昭公七年：「好以大屈」，謂賂以大屈也。周禮天官內　云：『凡王之好賜肉脩，則　人共之」，好賜連言，好亦賜也。鄭注釋爲王所善而賜，誤矣。</p>
<p>楊先生引詩經，太過於斷章取　了。小明第四章說：『靖恭爾位，正直是與。」第五章說：『靖恭爾位，好是正直。』我們狠容易了解鄧康成之所以說「好猶與也」，因爲這兩章的文義相近，如其不是押韵的關係，第五章也可以說「正直是好」，句法就一樣了。訓詁裏的甲猶乙也，本是中和乙的意義相近，而不能說甲就是乙。即使好字可訓做與，在此也只是黨與許與的與，而不是賜與的與。大雅烝民說：『民之秉彝，好是　德』和「好是正直」的句法完全相同，這只是喜悅的意思，和黨與許與的與，也不過意義相近，不能說『好」就是「與」。</p>
<p>把「好以大屈」的好釋爲賂，是可以的，因禮好賜迎言，好訓爲賜，也是可以的。但我們不應排斥『好』字的其他意義。「好以大屈』的好，依然包含有聯歡結好的意義。周禮常以好賜連言，內府又以好賜予三字連言，但它們依然各有區別。外府說：「　賜予之財用」，就沒有說「好」。太宰說：「好用之式」，鄭玄注：「宴好所贈予」，可見好本不是通常的贈予。內　注：「好賜，王所善而賜」，除了把好賜兩字合爲一義外，其實並沒有錯誤。</p>
<p>古代休字的讀法，和好字差不多，它們是同一語源，楊先生讀休爲好，本沒有什麼問題。問題是休字不應該只限於賜予的意義。因爲由我們看來，休之訓爲美，和好之訓爲美是一樣的。</p>
<p>楊先生引了許多銅器銘辭的證據，如小臣彝說：「追叔休于小臣貝三朋，臣三家，對厥休，一上面的休字只能解釋做賜與，就說「下文對厥休，若作對厥美訓釋，豈不離奇可笑。」還有效卣：「王錫公貝五十朋，公錫厥涉子效王休貝廿朋」，這是在王所賞的五十朋貝裏面分出二十朋來實效，上面說錫，下而說休。還由號叔旅鐘「天子多錫旅休」，追　一天子多錫追休」，錫是動詞，休是名詞。還有大保　「王水大保錫休余土」，瀕事甚「　休錫厥瀕事貝」，錫休連用，休錫連用。我們承認在這些據裏，休和錫的意義是相近的。</p>
<p>但是楊先生太拘滯了，他說：</p>
<p>考金文對揚王休之語句，必爲述作器之原因，君上賞賜其臣下，臣下作器記其事以爲光寵，此所謂揚君賜也。若云揚君美，賞錫臣下爲人君常事，何美之可言乎？此從事理言之，又可知其必不然者也。</p>
<p>我們眞不懂得他爲什麼把「光寵」和「美」分得這樣淸。君上賞賜臣下，從君面也上一說，許是常事，但從受賜的臣下說來，應當是光寵，也就是君上的好意，所以就要對揚他的「美」，這是狠平常，也狠容易解釋的。楊先生只是把休字好字看死板了，只可訓做賜予，所以就把揚君芙的美，也看成只是一般的美德而不能解釋爲專對某一人的美意了。</p>
<p>從訓詁說，休字除了息止的意義，爾雅釋詁「美也』，釋言「慶也」，廣雅釋詁「喜也」，從來就只解釋做美好和喜慶。就是從金文說，休字也不只用做賜予，有好些地方還要訓做美，對揚王休也是如此。不渦討論到這一點，我們還要牽涉到另一個甫要的問題。</p>
<p>銅器裏有一個　，銘文是「休王錫效父呂三，用作厥寳尊彝」，還有三個鼎，銘辭差不多。郭沫若先生作兩周金文辭大系說：「此孝王時器，休王即孝王也，古休孝本同音字。」那時，很有一部分人相信這個說法，如吳其昌先生便根據釋名釋言語「孝養也』，而禮記玉藻正義說『休養也』，來助郭氏張目。在金文疑年表上說：『郭君擬休王爲孝王，其昌反覆思之，卒無以易其說，不時從之，且爲之引申，厚其證焉。』但我覺得單靠聲音相通，沒有別的證據是很危險的。我以爲休王的休，只是一個動詞，不是人名，曾和郭先生討論過。後來，郭光生的修正本大系考釋，在召卣下說：</p>
<p>休王即懿王之弟孝王也。休孝古本同音字，孝王本稱休，後世于傳說問轉變爲孝耳。效父彝醫父鼎亦見『休王』，唐闌云：「休是動詞，召誥云「今休王不敢後，用顧畏于民碞」，可證。古人多有此例，如云「魯天子之命」，魯亦動詞也。揚夭子或王之魯休，而稱「休王」或「魯天子」，其義一也。縣妃彝云「縣妃敏揚伯　父休，曰：休伯吳　卹縣伯室」，休伯亦猶休王也』。今按如僅就彼二器而言，唐說亦可通。余初亦頗疑休是形容詞，故于謚法之起原一文中，凡言「休王」之器均未徴及。今得此器之讀，則動詞形容之說均不能適用也。如讀爲「召進啓事，奔走事皇辟君，休』，似亦可通，然方言啓進，即已有成，文理殊難條貫，故此讀亦不能適用。召誥語，余意仍宜從舊讀以今休斷句，下文有『王厥有成命治民，今休，王先服殷御事，比邇于我有周御事』，亦然，今休謂今得天之休命也。縣妃　之</p>
<p>「休伯」，余意亦伯羣父之號，蓋休王號休，伯羣父亦號休也。</p>
<p>郭先王先承認我的說法是可通的，只因鹵的句讀，不適用于動詞或形容詞，所以依舊說『休王』是孝王。其實召鹵說：「休王自毀使賞畢土方五十里」，除了自轂的地方使人來賞的一點外，休王賞畢土方五十里，和「休王錫效父呂三」，或『休王錫醫父貝」，文法上有什麼不同。那兩個銘辭要是可通，召卣就不能不適用。至於把「休伯」說成是伯羣父的號，就更覺牽強了。</p>
<p>民國二十六七年間，新出土的銅器有穆公鼎，銘文說：</p>
<p>穆公作尹姑宗室于　林。唯六月旣生霸乙卯，休天君弗望（忘）穆公聖粦明德。事先王，各于尹姑宗室繇林。君蔑尹姑曆，錫玉五品，馬四匹。拜稽首，對揚天君休，用作實。</p>
<p>「休天君弗望穆公』是稱美天君的沒有忘了穆公，休字是動詞，我的說法，在這裏完全被說明了。對揚王休可以變成「休王」，召揚伯休，可以變成「休伯」，對揚天君休，可以變爲「休天君」，那末，休王決不會是人名，更決不會是孝王了。</p>
<p>我們從這個問題裏，知道『休王』是由對揚王休的句法轉換過來的，那末，休字的意義就不應該限於賜與。因為對　王賜還可以勉强講通，假如把「休正錫」解　爲賜王錫，就不成文理了。休卣說：『召弗敢　王休異』，故　連文，是王的美意和　數，解休爲賜與，在這裏也是不通　。</p>
<p>休學本訓美，沒有賜與的意義。不過，賜與總是一番好意，所以『休』字就川作好意的賜與，久之也就單用做賜予的解釋了。命字本也沒有賜予的意義，在古書古器裏却常者這種用法，便是一個絕好的榜樣。</p>
<p>那末，小臣彝的「對厥休」，不妨是對厥美，並不離奇可笑。詩經的『對揚王休，』也不妨是對揚王美，更不見得『膚泛不切』，楊先生這種評語是有成見的，和考據本身無關。我們研究訓詁，要着重字義的全部，還要注意它們的發展，不可望文生義，扶得東來西又歪。楊先生等由金文證明休字可以解爲賜與，本是很好的發見，但我們要認淸楚這只是一個特殊的引申義。假如貿貿然用這個訓詁施於一切本可以解做『美』的地方，要去糾正它們，這就成爲「千慮一失」了</p>
<h3>曹雪芹家的籍貫</h3>
<p>— 適之</p>
<p>楊向奎先生從山東大學寄信來問紅樓夢作者曹雪芹家是不是河北省　潤縣人。楊先生引了靑島民言晚報（十二月廿三日）登載的「萍踪」先生的一篇「曹雪芹的籍貫」裏這一段話：</p>
<p>「淸初入關時，遼東漢人之歸附者多隸漢軍旗籍。紅樓夢作者曹雪芹即其一也。皇朝通志及八旗氏族通譜皆謂其世居瀋陽，而不知曹氏本籍河北之豐潤縣。尤侗艮齊文集「松茨詩稿序』有『曹子荔軒，豐潤人」云云。按荔軒名寅，字子淸，雪芹之祖也。觀此可知雪芹上世本爲豐潤人。其稱瀋陽，殆屬寄籍。……」</p>
<p>楊向奎先生是豐潤人，所以他對這個問題很感興趣。他信上說：「豐潤在明末淸初有四大姓，爲谷·魯·曹·陳。而明末滿人入關豐潤爲必經之地，被擄人民必多。曹家或即在此時被擄爲包衣，遂種瀋陽人。……漢軍旗本爲豐潤人而說爲東北人者，又有端方。端方姓陶，豐潤城北人，後在旗，乃訛爲瀋陽。曹家或亦類此。」</p>
<p>今天承王重民先生代我向北平圖書館借得尤侗的「艮齊倦　」。我檢讀「松茨詩　序」，才知道「萍踪」先生讀錯了這篇文字。這序裏並沒說「曹子荔軒豐潤人　」。原文是：</p>
<p>「曹子荔　與予爲忘年友，其詩蒼凉沉鬱，自成一家。人致乃兄冲谷薄遊吳門，因得讀其松茨詩　。信乎，兄弟擅塲，皆鄴中之後勁也。……予旣交冲谷，知爲豐潤人。豐潤京畿壯縣，……予昔司李其地，……得冠五太史而奉敎焉。……吾聞太史厭放明廬，出典大郡，一在徽州，二在鳳翔，三</p>
<p>在廣信。而冲谷在子舍，往往負劍從之。……」</p>
<p>這裏並沒有說曹寅（荔軒）是豐潤人，只說一位曹冲谷是豐潤縣人，是曹冠五太史的兒子。序文說「今致乃兄冲谷薄遊吳門」，只可以解作「曹荔軒介紹他的宗兄冲谷來遊蘇州。」於說「兄弟擅塲，皆鄴中之後勁」，那是泛用曹家的典故，並不是說他們眞是一家。故尤侗是曹寅的「忘年友」竟不知道這位「乃兄」的籍貫，直到「旣交冲谷」才「知爲豐潤人」。</p>
<p>那位「冠五太史」就是曹鼎望，是順治十六年的進士，選了翰林，做過三任知府。進土題名錄上說他是順天府豐潤縣人。冲谷是他的兒子，當然不是曹寅的弟兄。曹寅的父親呌曹　，包衣出身，做過二十二年的江寗織造。曹寅沒有哥哥，只有一個弟弟子猷，也見于尤侗的「曹太夫人六十壽序」與「棟亭賦」。他的家譜上沒有一個中進士點翰林的人。據八旗氏族通譜卷七四所說，曹寅的竹祖曹錫遠「世居瀋陽地方，來歸年月無考」。尤侗作序在康熙三十五年丙子（西歷一六九六），數上去到寅的曾祖，應該是明朝崇禎以前了。我們只能說：曹雪芹的家世，倒數上去六代，都不能算是　潤縣人。（曹家世系引見胡適文存卷三，頁八四四）曹錫遠是否從豐潤去的，我們現在無法考定了。但尤侗這篇序不够證明他家是豐潤人，只够證明曹寅曾同豐潤詩人曹冲谷認作本家弟兄。</p>
<p>將來楊向奎先生也許可以從這一條　　索上去尋求豐潤曹家的詩文或譜牒，也許可以幫助解答這個問題。</p>
<h3>北宋舊黨人士的「兩截底議論」</h3>
<p>— 郭廣銘</p>
<p>—兼考司馬光首倡募役法—</p>
<p>在宋仁宗時候，北宋初年所立定的法制已經生出許多流弊，尤其在受到西夏的侵擾之後，宋朝集中了全國的人力物力以謀應付，尙時常感到招架力量之不足，這時候，不但軍事的弱點暴露無遺，民政財政諸方面的弱點也隨之而全盤顯露出來了。范仲流於慶曆三四年（一〇四三—一〇四四）舉行新政而未能成功，其後大勢所趨，乃逼成了神宗熙寗中（一令六八—一〇七七）王安石的變法。</p>
<p>在范仲淹失敗之後，王安石當政之前，一般關心政治的學士大夫們，都還認定當時的政治經濟和軍事是應當有所改革的。例如當時以文才而大露鋒芒的蘇軾，便以爲「欲將天下納於至治」，非「大有矯拂於世俗」的改革不可。他在仁宗末年上書獻策，論列「安萬民，厚財貨，訓兵旅」的大計，建議「均戶口，較賦稅，敎戰守，定軍制，練軍實，倡勇敢」等事，也作了制御西夏和契丹的具體計畫，且至很誇大地說：「用臣之言，雖北取契丹可也。」用朱熹的話來說，他確實「是煞要出來整理弊壞處」的樣子。</p>
<p>神宗即位之後，一意要富國强兵，王安石出而担當變更法度的大任，把理財視爲首要工作，就此創制了種種新法，不顧一切，强力推行。但「革弊於久安」，積習旣成，猝難移轉，所以當推行新法之際，在社會上，時別是在士大夫羣中，引惹起無數的糾紛，遭受到無數的阻力。到這時候，前此那些主張改革的，甚至於已經參加了王安石的變法的初步工作的一些人，全都却顧退縮，改變甚至放棄了原來的意見了。再拿蘇軾爲例，他看到靑苗法招致了許多紛擾，於是不再談理財的事了；看到李憲對西夏用兵的失敗，於是不再談興兵的事了。全盤翻轉了前此自己的那些議論，甚至連揀汰冗兵的事，也說怕招致人怨而以爲不必做了。</p>
<p>在朱子語類當中，有好幾條都是記朱熹批評蘇軾前後議論矛盾的。有一條的結尾說：「他分明有兩截底議論」。</p>
<p>其實，在所謂舊黨當中，「分明有兩截的議論」的，並不止蘇軾一人。只因朱熹對於蘇軾的爲人素無敬意，所以特別加以指責罷了。即如朱子語類中便另有兩條記載：</p>
<p>「呂氏家傳載荊公（王安石）當時與申公（呂公著）極　相好，新法亦皆商量來，故行新法時甚望申公相助。又用明道（程顥）作條例司，皆是望諸賢之助。是時想見其意好。後來盡背了初意，所以諸賢盡不從。」</p>
<p>『新法之行，諸公實共謀之，雖明道先生不以爲不是。蓋那時也是合變時節。但後來人情洶洶，明道始勸之以不可做逆人情底事。及王氏排衆議行之甚力，而諾公始退散。</p>
<p>朱熹的這兩段談話，是不很公允的，因爲他太偏袒舊然中的程呂二人了。他以爲新舊黨人之分裂，乃是由於王安石「後來盡背了初意」之故，事實所吿訴我們的，却恰恰與此相反。王安石自進入政府，創行新法以來，其作風，其用意，眞正做到了「始終如一」的地步，他後來之所行，即在貫澈其變法的「初意」，說他因爲受到種種阻力而尙未能將其「初意」完全實現，或則有之。說他「盡背了初意」，却實在是一種誣詞。朱熹旣明明說「新法之行，諸公實共謀之」，而程顥之曾經參加推行新法中的農田水利法，爲當時派往各路的八名使臣之一，更是衆所周知的事。呂公著則不但曾和王安石共同商量過新法，司馬光的日錄中載光於熙寗三年四月與神宗面論呂公著前後自相反覆的事情，有云：</p>
<p>「呂公著誠有罪，不在今日。向者朝廷委公著專舉臺官，乃盡舉條例司之人，與條例司互相表裏，使熾張如此，乃始逼於公議，復言其非，此所可罪也。」（據名臣言行錄轉引）這可見呂氏於推行新法的當初，原爲竭力贊助之人，是後來「逼於公議」，才又變了態度的。</p>
<p>由上所述，可見程呂二人後來和王安石的關係之所以變壞，其過全不在安石，乃是程呂兩人畏於「人情之洶洶」，「逼於公議」，隨而「盡背了初意」，盡背了新法和五安石了。然則這兩人豈不也是「分明有兩截底議論」嗎？</p>
<p>舊黨中的其他人物，如韓琦，如富弼，本都是在慶曆年間和范仲淹一同興辦改革事業的人，在那次改革失敗之後，對於其時的賦役制度和對外的和戰政策，也仍在不斷地指陳其措施之失當和改善之必要，然而一到王安石推行新法，他們却合力加以沮壞。富弼且竟至勸吿宋神宗「二十年口不言兵」，這和當年勇於改作的精神相較，眞是判若兩人了。南宋葉適在其習學記言序目中有一段說：</p>
<p>『歐陽修言弼明敏而果銳，此初執政時也，作相後則不然矣。弼初執政，更張之意過於范韓，至作相，乃以一切堅守無所施爲爲是，雖如琦之微有改作亦不能從也。古之賢相，因憂患而益明，周公是也；弼因憂患益昏，面猶欲自以爲賢，非余所知也。」</p>
<p>若改用朱熹的話來說，韓琦和富弼，當然也是「分明有爾截底議論」的。</p>
<p>反對新法最力，後來被目爲舊黨黨魁的司馬光，也同樣的「有　截的議論」。新法當中最重要的項目，一是青苗法，二是募役法。在道兩種新法推行之時，司馬光即曾出死力反對過，到神宗死了，哲宗即位，司馬光秉政之後，這兩種法制也和所有別種新法一樣，被司馬光次第廢罷。在廢罷之前，他把靑苗，免役，將官三種新法和西夏的侵擾，一併稱作四害，並且向人表示說：「四害不除，死不暝目。」可見他對於這幾種新法痛恨的程度了。然而我們對於募役法的歷史推求一下，便可以知道，在王安石創行募役法的好幾年之前，司馬光早已有此項提議了。</p>
<p>文獻通考卷十二，職役考一載：</p>
<p>『英宗時諫官司馬光言：置鄉戶衙前以來，民益困乏，不敢營生。富者反不如貧，貧者不敢求富。臣嘗行於村落，見農民生具之微而問其故，皆言「不敢爲也。今欲多種一桑，多置一牛，蓄二年之糧，藏十匹之帛，鄰里已目爲富室，指抉以爲衙前矣，况敢益田疇，葺閭舍乎？」……</p>
<p>『臣愚以爲：凡農民租稅之外，宜無所預。衙前當募人爲之，以優重相補，不足則以坊郭上戶爲之。彼坊郭之民，部送綱運，典領倉庫，不費二三，而農民常費八九，何則？　利　愚之性不同也。」</p>
<p>在這兩段文字後邊，馬端臨附有一段按語說：</p>
<p>『按溫公此奏，言之於之英宗之時，所謂募人充衙前，即熙寗之法也。然旣曰募，則必有以酬之，此錢非出於官，當役者合輸之，則助役錢　容　不徽？而當時諸緊論此事，復斷斷不可何也？」</p>
<p>馬端臨這段簡單的按語，我們可以分析爲三點：</p>
<p>一，在英宗時候，司馬光已經建議「衙前當募人爲之」。</p>
<p>二，司馬光所提出的辦法，實即等於後來王安石所行的助役（　募役）法。</p>
<p>三，司馬光竟爾反對王安石所行的助役法，實在是一件可怪的事。</p>
<p>到這里，我們便又只好引用朱熹的話來解釋：是因爲司馬光在煕寗時已經」盡背了初意」，所以便也不免「有兩戳底談論」了。</p>
<p>通考所引錄的司馬光的那兩段文字，其實並不是在同一道奏疏之內的。今查于其所引錄的第一段乃是司馬光「論衙前剳子」中的一段，見司馬文正公集卷卅八。其所引錄的第二段，「臣愚以爲」以下諸語，乃是司馬光「論財利疏」中的一段，見司馬文正公集卷二十三。李　的續通鑑長編卷一九六，把司馬光的「論財利疏」列置於仁宗嘉祐七年（一〇六二）五月丁未朔，較之通考所說的時間又早了兩年，下距王安石推行募役新法，還只有八九年的間隔，司馬光不應便已忘却了他在「論財利琉一中的那一段話，然而他竟「盡肯初意」，對於募役新法一直地拚命加以反對了。（三十七年一月廿五。於北平北大）</p>
<h3>南詔史論（三）</h3>
<p>— 向達</p>
<p>—唐代記載南詔諸書孜—</p>
<p>這應該是畫齊休的雲南行記，所以紀載地自己的見聞。御覽九三七嘉魚條引雲南記，紀雅州丙穴嘉魚；八六七茶條引雲南記紀名山縣蒙山茶；八三九稻條引雲南記，紀雅州榮經縣稻，九四二蛤條引雲南記，紀新安蠻婦人；九八〇蘆菔條引雲南記，紀嶲州界產諸葛菜；九五八拓條引雲南記，九七四甘蔗條引雲南記皆及會川；九七三餘甘條引雲南記，又及瀘水南岸有能甘子。以上所紀地名，有雅州，名山，榮經，新安，嶲州，會川，用樊綽蠻書卷一雲南界內途程篇中所紀自成都至雲南蠻王府路程來對校，御覽引雲南記中的地名都在這一條路上；蠻書過瀘水渡繩橋一句有注云，「雲南行記云渠桑驛」。由此可以推知雲南記的作者韋齊休入雲南，大約是取的淸溪關，路，所以能紀載沿途見聞，經過地方，和蠻書所耙淸溪關路一樣。袁滋入雲南，走的是從石門外出魯望昆川，即有門道，亦即秦漢間的五尺道，與韋齊休不同。故御覽引雲南記之爲韋齊休的雲南行記，而非袁滋書，大概可以無疑。韋齊休書除上舉御覽引二十三條外，蠻書卷二渡繩橋一句下本注引一條，卷五六騐弟五標題下本注亦記韋齊休雲南行記有十騐。又御覽九二四鸚鵡條引雲南行記兩條，一及瞿竿館，一及新安城路，瞿竿館無可攷，新安城路則仍然在清溪關路上，應該就是畫齊休的書。何以御覽引一書而析爲二名，則不得而知。再加上郡齊讀書志所引序文大略，韋齊休雲南行記所可放者如此而已。</p>
<p>當長慶三年韋審規韋齊休使雲南的時候，同時冬唐朝發表了以中書侍郎同平章事杜元穎充西川節度使。元穎是杜如晦的五世孫，以進士入爲翰林學士。穆宗即位，「不閱歲至宰相，甫再　」出爲劍南西川節度使，同平章事。」到西川以後，爲欲逢迎穆宗，以固寵幸，於是悉索珍異以獻，於邊防棄而不顧，因有文宗太和三年南詔大舉入寇之役，進逼成都，西川寳貨工巧子女爲之蕩然。通鑑唐紀文宗太和三年十一月紀南詔入寇西川，說</p>
<p>元穎以舊相文雅自高，不曉軍事，專務蓄積，减削士卒衣糧。西南戍邊之卒衣食不是皆入蠻境，鈔盜以自給，蠻人反以衣食資之。由是蜀中　實動靜，蠻皆知之。南詔自嵯顚謀大舉入寇，邊州屢以吿，元穎不之信。嵯顚兵至，邊城一無備禦。……</p>
<p>韋審規韋齊休是長慶三年出使雲南，取道淸溪關路，沿途所經如　雅黎嶲諸州，正是太和三年南韶入寇的路。杜元頴穎鎭蜀，邊防廢弛，恐怕就是受了韋齊休雲南行記序中申張斥棄清溪關外諸地的影響。情報不實，遂釀巨禍。後來李德裕爲西川節度使，想替杜元穎减輕罪名，將責任推到三十多年前的韋臯身上，以爲是韋畢不應與南詔構和，因而人心懈怠，疆塲無備，故有太和三年之役。今日看來，衛公此說，絕非持平之論也。</p>
<p>德宗貞元元年韋　拜檢校戶部尙書兼成都尹御史大夫劍南西川節度使，代張延賞。坐鎭西川，歷二十一年。據宋史藝文志，韋臯著有西南夷事狀二十卷，二十一年的經營在書內必有詳細的紀載，今僅通鑑德宗貞元十年正月考異引事狀一則，正舊唐書韋臯傳之誤，餘無可考。韋臯以後鎭蜀有名者爲李德裕。李文　集　進　南備　錄狀，文中有云，</p>
<p>臣頃在西川，講求利病，頗收要害之地，實　經遠之圖。因著西南備邊錄十三卷，臣所創立城鎭，兼盡小圖，米　器甲，無不該備。……第四卷叙維州本末，尤似精詳。……新唐書李德裕傳說德裕至蜀。</p>
<p>乃建籌邊樓，按南道山川險要與　相入者圖之左，西道與吐蕃　者圖之右。其部落衆寡饋　遠邇曲折咸具。乃召習邊事者與之指畫商訂，凡虜之情僞盡知之。</p>
<p>大約籌邊樓上左右兩　所繪地岡即包涵在備邊錄的小圖之內。德裕此　集作十三卷，宋史藝文志作一卷，疑宋史有誤。通鑑文宗太和五年五月李德裕索南詔所掠百姓得四千人條考異引德裕西南備邊錄，德裕書傳世，只此一則。而新唐書德裕傳，叙鎭蜀日籌畫甚詳，疑其中不少取材於備邊錄也。（本段續完）</p>
<h3>上海電話事業之沿革</h3>
<p>— 王大椿</p>
<p>上海　內電話，向分兩大系統：一爲交通部直轄之上海電話局，一爲美商經營之上海電話公司當西歷一八八一年（清光緒七年）時，英國東方電話公司，開始獲得上海電話經營權，期限十八年，此爲上海市內電話開辦之嚆矢。其時係隸屬於英租界工部局，至一九〇〇年，組織英商上海　洋德律風公司（Shanghai　Mutual　Telephone　Company），始爲外商投資公司。一九二九年，華洋公司出售，由美國國際電報電話公司（International　Telegraph　and　Telephone　Compang簡稱I．T．andT.）收買，改稱爲上海電話公司（Shanghai　Telephone　Compang簡稱S．T．C．），專營舊公共租界，法租界，及其越界築路地區之電話事業，其時，電話機數爲三三六〇〇架，此後，租界日見繁榮，電話機數，亦逐漸增加，雖中經一二八及八一三之兩次日寇侵擾，話機不無損失，但勝利迄今，電話機又已增至七萬架以上。外商經營之電話，在工部局時代，爲該局之一部份，人民殊不知利用，僅外商行號，裝用電話，用戶祇數百號，係磁石式，華洋公司成立，建築中央局，有共電式交換機三萬號，西區路陞局，亦爲共電式一萬號，上海電話公司收買後，大量擴充，加建福建路局，敏體尼局，西局，北局，匯山局，畢勛局，虹橋局，一律改為旋轉式白動電話（Rotary　Automatic　Sytem），自此，該公司之事業，益見發達矣。</p>
<p>當租界電話事業，漸次擴展時，其電話機，每越租界範圍，裝至界外，淸廷爲保持主權起見，在一九〇二年（光緒二十八年），開始創設上海南市電話局，企圖制止租界電話，裝入市區，當時之交換機，爲磁石式，容量四百八十綫，用戶約二百戶，地址在南市毛家弄，西歷一九〇九年，（宣統元年），開設閘北分局時，因用戶激增，曾計劃自建局屋，並更改交換機程式，至一九二二年（民國十一年），始在大南門，建造南市總局，容量共電式二千號，永興路建造閘北分局，容量磁石式七百號，東昌路，建造浦東分局，容量磁石式二百八十號。此後，再開設江灣，吳淞，南翔，龍華各分局，一九二九年（民國十八年），爲配合大上海之發展計劃，決定採用自動電話，訂購司瑞喬步進式自動機（Strowgre　Step—by—step　Automatic　System）四千八百綫，擬在南市總局，裝置三千綫，閘北一千五百綫，浦東三百綫，一九三二年（民國二十一年），一二八日寇在滬構壞，閘北，江灣南翔，吳淞各分局，均遭受砲火損毀，戰後畫力恢復，至一九三三年（民國二十二年）四月十五日，南市總局及閘北分局，自動電話完成，一九三四年，（民國二十三年），浦東分局擬裝之自動機鍵三百綫，移裝至三民路新建之市中心局，浦東分局，改爲共電式，容量六百號。</p>
<p>抗戰以前，上海電話局各交換所容量，大致如下：</p>
<p>局　名　程　式　容</p>
<p>南　市　自動式　三〇〇〇</p>
<p>閘　北　自動式　一五〇〇</p>
<p>市中心　自動式　三〇〇</p>
<p>龍　華　自動式　一五〇</p>
<p>浦　東　共電式　六〇〇</p>
<p>吳淞磁石式　五〇</p>
<p>大塲磁石式　五〇</p>
<p>眞茹磁石式　五〇</p>
<p>閔行磁石式　五〇</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，吳淞局首遭毀滅，閘北市中心，浦東，大塲，眞茹等局，均以地處戰區，相繼將機械拆下，搬入租界存儲，以免物質損失，至國軍西撤，市區全面淪陷，南市，龍華，閔行等局機械，亦拆存租界。抗戰期內，國際情勢，幻變多端，拆存租界之機械，除一部份運赴後方外，餘均被敵偽侵佔，敵華中電氣通信公司，即在抗戰之第二年，竊據市區，經營電話，日美開戰後，該公司更侵佔美商上海電話公司，而組成上海電話總局，勝利來臨，江南電信規復處，奉令接收上海電信事業，所有南市，虹口，閘北，市中心等處電話，均經接收整理，成爲現在隸屬於上海電信局之各電話交換所。至上海電話公司，則接收後，物歸原主，仍交還商經營矣。</p>
<h3>雜談上海電信局的報房</h3>
<p>— 寧湧生</p>
<p>「報房」是電報部門的業務重心所在，它執司着傳遞電報的關鍵，電報傳遞的迅速與否，是與報房有着密切的關係。現在報房內用以收發電報的機器種類很多，如電傳打字機，高速度無綫電自動機，高速度有綫電自動機，傳眞電報，無綫業人工機，有綫電莫爾斯機，有綫電音響機等，是依　來去電報的多少而分別決定那一條電路用那一類的機器。</p>
<p>原來電信局的「報房」分成三個部份，「無綫快機報房」和「有綫報房」二部裝設在　州路總營處樓上，另有一部份「無綫人工機報房」，因爲福州路環境不適宜於無綫人工機收訊，所以一向裝設在閘北育嬰堂路，就稱它爲「閘北支台」。原來總營業處與閘北支台間的往來電報，是項經電傳打字機或報差的傳送，以及必要的編號手續等等，其間多一轉手，對於往來的電報在時間上不免要延遲。電信局的業務主管們爲了這一個問題，曾　費苦心以謀補救，現在他們已從創造性的規劃進行到具體的——無綫電人工遙控收發報制（Manualradio　receiving　and　transmiting　remote　control　system）——那就是將原在閘北的「無綫人工報房」遷移至總營業處樓上，與「無綫電快機報房」及「六綫報房」合併在一處，將閘北支台改爲無綫人工報房的收訊臺；和快機報房同樣地究行遙控收發報制。這樣一來，總營業處收下的電報可以立刻送到樓上拍發，毋庸再經電傳打字機或報差傳送到閘北支台了。這中間多一轉手因而不免時間延遲的問題，已經獲得了理想的解決，平均每張電報可以節省到一小時半左右，以最近遷移的永嘉·西安·南昌·昆明·成都·瀋陽·厦門·汕頭等八條電路每天的來去報四千份計算，則將節省達六千小時左右之鉅，這該不是一個很小的改進」！緊接着這一創造性的改進，隨又增闢了成都·昆明·永嘉·西安·南昌等五處特快電報，當然又給用戶以不少的便利。</p>
<h3>有綫報房中電傳打字機部份</h3>
<p>— 蔡南式攝</p>
<h3>拍發特快電報的門徑</h3>
<p>— 徐達海</p>
<p>除了福州路，長治路的電信局營業處外，最近十六舖營業處也開放了，其準確迅速的程度完全一樣</p>
<p>「特快電報電」是商業電報中最快的一種電報，余非機綫發生障，它準能在一小時半裏送達收報人。至於報費，却和加急電一樣，只多加了二萬四千元的「特快專送費」，在任何情形下，電信局對於特快電報總是另眼相看的。唯其這樣，拍「特快」的人也特別多，不信，請看電信局總營業處的「特快」窗口前，每天總是排着一陣很長的行列，在時間上講，對於拍報人總是一層損失。</p>
<p>上海電信局爲了補救這個缺點，確曾煞費苦心，先後在長治路二十五號，十六舖裏馬路五十九號的示範營業處開放「特快電報」，一來可以使那幾個地區的市民，免得跋踄至福州路，二來可以减少總營業（處的擁擠，减少時間上的浪費。</p>
<p>從示範營業處收下的一張「特快電報」會不會延誤？不會的。當收發員接到一張「特快」後，詳細看過，（若未曾譯碼的即由譯電員譯就）收下報費，付訖收據，立即從電傳機直接拍至總營業處的報房，由報務員照原電拍發至收報地點，以上手續準於一刻鐘內全部完畢，其迅速準確的程度和總營業處拍出完全相同，而佔發報人數較少之便利，有時反較總營業處拍出爲快。</p>
<p>明白了上面的情形，懂得拍發「特快電報」門徑的人，定會跑到示範營業處去拍發的。</p>
<h3>電信常識講話（八）</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第三講　怎樣選用特別業　（績）</p>
<p>第二種：凡發報人在電首註明「專送」或　FS　標識，但原電祗列有收報人名址一處者，意即當電報到達時，如果收報人已經離開收報局所在地，應由電局向原列地址查明收報人的去處及其新地址，幷將原電按址續發，直到電報送妥或無人繼續供給收報人的新地址爲止。</p>
<p>選用跟轉特別業務的電報，每多發一次，就得多出一次報費，除發到收報人各址欄裏所列的第一處地方的報費由發報人照付外，其餘各段的報費，等電報送妥時由收報人所在地的電局向收報人收取。但有一點非常重要：那就是如果電報雖已送妥但收報人不願付費，或電報最後竟無法投遞，或在上面所舉第二補的塲合之下，最後竟無法繼續獲得收報人的新地址時，那末，所有第二段以上各段的報費，仍由發報人向發報人收取；所以發報人在加註跟轉標識時，必須瞭解他本身應負的責任。</p>
<p>（七）改發最近郵局方面爲宣傳郵政常識，曾經印有各種宣傳品，分貼在來信的背面，隨信送給收件人。筆者方　收到的一張是以「郵局請您合作」爲題，下面寫着：「尊處通信處如有更動，請：（一）把新地址趕快通知親戚朋友；（二）臨走前把新地址留交同住的朋友，託他代爲立刻轉寄。（原班改寄的信，郵局不另收費）。（三）如無熟人可託，請向郵局申請改寄郵件。」</p>
<p>這裏，我們準備談到的「改發」特別業務，正巧和「改寄郵件」的性質相同。就電報來說，分處通信勵如有更動，自然最好是預先把新地址通知有關各方，萬一匆促啓程，事前不及通知，就該在臨走前把新地址留交同住的家屬或親友，託他將各地來電送還當地電局請求照所開新地址改發，如果沒有熟人可託，也可以向當地電局聲　將各方發給本人的電報，改發至所開新地址。</p>
<p>依據公衆的習慣，通常非有重大事故，並不輕易拍發電報，所以，電局爲謹愼服務起見，對於處理改發電報的手續，不得不較郵局處理改發信件更其來得愼重一些。舉一個子，當你照上面例舉的郵局宣傳品　所提示的第二點，託你同住的朋友將各地寄給你的信件立刻轉寄時，祇要勿把原封拆開，並將信封面上原來所寫地址劃去，重新加塡收件人的新地址（或另用紙片寫明收件人新地址，固貼在原信封上），立刻交給送信郵差帶回或投入鄰近的郵筒裏，趕上原班改寄就行，手續相當簡便。如果是改發電報，那就得由申請改發人（指你的家屬或同居）備具書面，向當地電局申請，始能受理。倘使沒有熟人可託，也須在臨走前備具書面，向當地電局申請把各方發給本人的電報，昭所開新地址改發。又上項申請，萬一不及在事前提出，也得等待到達新地方後向當地電局（指新地方的電局）拍發納費公電通知原住地方的電局照辦。電局對於提出申請改發的人，在必要時，還得要求提供身份證件，以昭愼重。</p>
<p>在第一講裏已經說過，郵件和電報在計費方法上的最大的差別是郵件係根據重量計費而電報却根據傳送所需的時間（即電報長度）做標準，因此，郵局規定改發郵件必須趕上原班改寄，緣能不另收費而電局對於改發電報，每改發一次，就得多納一次報費。</p>
<p>採用改發特別業務的改發報費，在原則上，須待電報送妥時向收報人收取，如遇收報人拒付或電報最後竟至無法投遞時，纔由電局向聲請改發人補收。但確定祗須改發一處的電報，如經申請改發人的要求，也得由申請改發人先將改發報費付去；必要時，申請改發人並可要求電局將原列爲尋常電的電報改列爲加急電改發，或者把原列爲加急電的電報改列爲　常電改發，照改列的報類預付改發報費。</p>
<p>改發特別業務的納費標識是「自……（某地）改發」或　Recirectedfrom……（地名）　，在拍發時聯合一字。已經投送過而沒有送妥的地址，在改發時都予略去。例如：</p>
<p>（原電發至上海）上海南京西路（2492）號王大仁……（下接電文和署名）</p>
<p>（初次改發至漢口）　Recirected　from　Shanghai　漢口旋宮飯店王大仁……（下接電文和署名）</p>
<p>（再次改發至重慶）　Redirected　from　Shanghai　Hankow　重慶中山三路（536）號王大仁……（下接電文和署名）</p>
<p>最後，請讀者不要弄錯：這一節裏所講的「改發」，是指改發到其他地方。如果收報人僅僅是遷移到同一地方的其他住址，那祗要事前把新地址通知電局改送，或祗在原址門上貼一紙條，寫明新遷地址，電局的報差就會按址改送。</p>
<h3>國際電報的基本知識</h3>
<p>— 施錦榮</p>
<p>每個拍電報的，都希望拍得快，不錯，和　費便宜，但希望是對稱的，一半在人家，一半在自己，本身應對於拍發電報有一種常識，怎樣拍得快，拍那種報快，怎樣不錯，錯了如何補救，如何可以便宜，這就是上海人所謂門檻了，請看下面；</p>
<p>到那裏去拍國際電報</p>
<p>國際電報是由國際電台　家經營，在上海，現有三個營業處，即沙遜大厦的總營業處和福州路思南路兩個分營業處。發報人如覺路遠不便，在每日上午十時至下午八時內，可撥電話一一一二〇號通知國際電台派外勤營業員收取。除報費外不收其他費用，但電話通知收取的電報，必須用現款拍發，暫時不適用於記賬發電。</p>
<p>那種報最合算</p>
<p>商業和私人拍的電報有下列幾種，現在把名稱，價錢，和快慢都附加說明，你一看就知道。</p>
<p>尋常電——用明語，收全費，除官電加急電外，傳遞最快。</p>
<p>密語電——電文用五個字母組成的密語，照全費打六折，和尋常電同時傳遞，五字起碼。</p>
<p>加急電——照尋常及密語電加倍收費，提前拍發。</p>
<p>遲緩電——電文用明語，照全費减半，在尋常電後拍發，五字起碼。</p>
<p>書信電——電文用明語，照全費三分之一收費，夜信電得在交發日之次晨投送，日信電得在交發日之再次晨投送，起碼廿五字。</p>
<p>上面六種報裏，密語電最經濟實惠，只化十分之六的費用，而和尋常電一樣快，並且一個　可以包括幾句話，所以密語電可算得價廉物美『</p>
<p>怎樣利川時差</p>
<p>各位都知道中外時間不同，我們這裏吃中飯，紐約那裏吃宵夜。倫敦上辦公室，我們正下班所以在我們辦公鐘點內打美國報，到美國已在夜裏，除非晚上也辦公，拍遲緩電落得便宜。拍歐洲報，上午可以拍遲緩電，正趕上他們辦公，當然上面是指通報情形正常而言，倘若工作不暢，電報擁擠，自當別論。</p>
<p>寫得淸楚</p>
<p>英文裏的UNVCI等　母最容易弄錯，明語還可以詳得出來，密語就無法譯出。所以要寫得淸楚，一看明白，即使打字，最好全用大寫，地名，住址，數目更要淸楚，倘若一名數地者，務必附註明白。</p>
<p>怎樣拍免費和便宜電報</p>
<p>不化錢拍電報行麼？行，假使你收到的電報裏面有幾個空意義不明，或者有些疑問，你可以請電台打報去查問，不收報費。如果電報拍出之後，你想補充，或更正幾個字，甚至註銷幾個字，你不必另打電報，只消帶了收據，請電臺你辦理，只收你要補充，更正，或註銷幾個字的錢，倘使電報發出後，久無回音，你想催促收報人速來回電，你也不必另打電報，只消帶了收據，請電臺你辦理，只收一個字的報費，旣省錢又省事。</p>

<h3>看畫記</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>鑒賞書畫是騷人墨客的雅事，這句話並無褒貶之意，因爲　　是一抓藝術，沒有相當的修養，是不配談鑒賞的。本文所以以「看畫」爲題，是預先聲明我雖喜歡畫，但祗有憑肉眼直覺的看的資格而已，是談不到鑒賞的，而且因爲不配鑒賞，所以我喜看的畫，也決不是甚麼藝苑不巧的名作。</p>
<p>說句不怕難爲情的話，我所歡喜看的畫，祗就是鄉下人所稱的「洋畫張」而已。這幾天的馬路地攤上或沿街的牆壁上，就多的這些玩意兒，甚麼猪八戒招親，梁山泊一百另八條好漢，以及老鼠迎親之類，雖然不登大雅之堂，在我個人却覺得頗值一看。</p>
<p>這種民間Gallery的觀衆們，雖然多半是鄉下人或是兒童，不過從他們面上所現的笑容以及指手畫脚的批評觀察，他們雖不知道甚麼呌做藝術，但他們對於藝術的天眞要求，恐怕較之名家畫展中的一輩風雅觀衆，更來得富有眞正的感情吧。</p>
<p>近年來上海時有名家畫展，據說「捧塲」的人頗多，而且定價愈昂，銷售也愈暢，一幅「佳件」往往上面連粘了四五張「某先生訂購」的紅紙條，足見藝術文化並不如一般人所說的已經「低落」了；不過再看看報紙上的廣告，覺得大部份名家畫展的贊助人，則又多是幾個熟名字。大概因爲藝術愈臻高境，知音的人也就愈少。如此一想，則又不禁爲藝術悲了。</p>
<p>我已說過，鑒賞高深的藝術是非有相等程度的修養不可的；不過藝術的存在意義恐並不限於僅僅是鑒賞，尤其不是僅供少數八富作裝飾或點綴的鑒賞。在舞又　舉的少數文人筆下，藝術兩　幾已被看做是象牙塔上的塔尖，變做了俗人們所不能高攀的束　。可是眞正的藝術却必須是人　的，它必須是一種具有血肉氣　的東西。</p>
<p>我承認世上有天才的藝術家，因爲一個人可能有特別的天賦。但我不相信除了大自然自己所　　的藝術之外，會有來自天上　人間藝術。因爲人的藝術要求祗是人的眞美善的感情要求而已，藝術的觀感固隨各人的生活條件不同而不同，然而其發乎感情以要求一點，則完全相同。</p>
<p>有人譏諷近來書畫市塲的典吐，是因爲許多暴發戶欲附風雅，這也許是一部份實情。但不論是暴發戶也罷，是書香門第也罷，愛好書畫並不能算是一種罪過；罪過的是一輩甘願爲金錢而犧牲大衆藝術要求的所謂藝術家。</p>
<p>譬如說，頗多人訾議街頭的　環圖　含有「封建毒素」，這也誠然誠然；像那些猪八戒招親與梁山泊英雄之類的「洋畫張」，又何嘗不可說是含有「毒素」；不過如果我們的高尚的藝術家們祗全神貫注的畫着幾筆疏疏落洛的墨團或呌人愈看愈糊塗的所　新印象派之類的「藝壇傑作」，那麼「民間畫廊」恐怕祗有始終　猪八戒招親一類的東西佔據下去了，而街頭巷尾的連環圖畫攤，也永將成爲大衆的圖書館了</p>
<p>在近代繪畫史上，不論技巧與取材，業已發生了許多變化，尤其是技巧方面，單是光與色澤，就不知起了多少變革，可是因寫過份注朮技巧的結果，圖畫的內容却愈離大衆的藝術要求愈遠。反之，孫行者鬧天空和猪八戒招親一類的「洋畫張」，雖數十　如舊，但却依舊是鄉下人家點綴新年的唯一「壁飾」。鄉下人也許僅把這些東西當作糊壁的花紙用，不過在他們眼中，較之那些滿紙油彩墨團的玩意兒，畢竟順眼得多了。至於有無「封建的毒素」，你我又怎能去怪鄉下人呢！</p>
<h3>真理的影子</h3>
<p>— 施施</p>
<p>在一只八仙桌上吃飯，我面向着四扇長窗，只見一碗湯裏反映出那窗的影子，隨着湯水的彼動，那窗影一晃晃地煞是好看。我有意呌兩個弟弟也鑒賞一下，繼而轉念，一個坐在我的下手，另一個坐在我對面，恰好背向着長窗，都不會看到我所發現的景像。</p>
<p>長窗還是那幾扇長窗，只是因爲我們立塲不同，觀點不同，所得的印像也自異樣。我現在看見的不是長窗的本相，僅是長窗的影子。湯水把反映出來的影子；一晃一晃的是水的波動，長窗可矗立在那裏並未晃動。</p>
<p>明白是由於立塲的不同或背景的相殊，我沒有強要人欣賞那晃動的長窗。</p>
<p>這本來是一種當識，不算希罕。然而古往今來，忽視了這種常識的人又何其多，往儒先哲，偶有所感，發抒成文，自有一種至理，但他祗發抒他一時的見聞或感想，並無要別人永奉爲金科玉律的意思。偏是後來的腐懦，詳爲評註，斷爲千古不易的眞理。更有以宗派爲尚的「學者」盲目地認爲眞理只此一家，別的都是邪說競，相攻訐，造成許多無謂的爭執。後來的人更參與了宗派之爭，爭的只是意氣，離眞理益遠。如果他們能明白往儒先哲們的立塲或背景，也許更瞭然於他們的命意，不致會那麼「鍥而不舍」了。</p>
<p>燉研故紙堆的學究們終日孜孜，與現實生活隔離了，窮年累月之後，或許由於偶而的靈感，忽地會從古書中發掘出些什麼來。然而發爲一種論調，自信爲一種眞理，硬要別人同樣地賞識，我們可別那樣輕信，訂能那不是眞理，而只是眞理的影子。也有些標新立異的人，其目的只是在激起別人的注意，以遂其沽名釣譽的目的，那麼他們之所謂眞理，自然更要大打折扣了。</p>
<p>即使是眞理吧，也須看在什麼條件下產生。在某種條件下的眞理移在另一個立塲及觀點下，可能究全走樣。臀如歐氏幾何學上的公理與公式在非歐氏幾何學上便全講不通。</p>
<p>偶然看到一段古文，是一位殉國忠臣的自白書：「婦事夫猶臣事君也，臣婦不負臣，臣敢負國乎！」眞是十足奴才的口吻。所謂妻于是丈夫奴隸，臣民是帝王的奴隸，在這民主時代看來，不由人不斥之爲荒謬。然而在繼脚盛行時代有幾個人有眞知灼見，能看見繼脚是一種罪無？當時的慈母，竟沒有一個不是寗願坐視她的嬌女飲泣的。前人之所認為當然，斷斷必爭者，於今看來，不過是笑話而已。莫道「人心不古」必是一種壞現象，思想上的超脫一切拘束，例是一種大進步。</p>
<h3>「對我生財」</h3>
<p>— 王考</p>
<p>新春出門，大約到處都可以看見「對我生財」貼滿牆頭，發財當然是中國人普）遍的要求，而、「對我生財」，蓋尤其可以代表中國的民族性與生活方式者。何則，中國雖自己吹得很嚮，「地大物博」，但若統計每一農民的財產保有量，在戰前，大約不過平均二三十元，折合今日數字，即以二十萬倍計，亦不過四百至六百萬元耳，衣不蔽體，屋不蔽風雨，吃的更談不到營養，所以才有人說中國只是大貧小貧之分，而無有產無產之別。也正因爲這個，一般人對於發財一念，懷之甚切，其實所謂發財云云者，也不過維持溫飽的生活而已，孟子的烏托邦只是五畝之宅，樹之以桑，七十者可以衣帛，乃至鷄豚狗彘無失其時，可以食肉之類，幾乎連精神生活一點也談不到的。我們奇怪的便是從孔孟墨老倒如今，已在三千年上下，而這種極低限度的「免於飢餓之自由」仍然在虛無縹緲中，不但見了外人自愧，即對於前哲，似亦未免責任過於重大矣，那麼「發財」一念，又豈可輒加非議乎？可是這發財的事，手段實在太多，大致不過兩途，一種是利人利己而發財者，一種是損人利已而發財者，不幸我們中國却多半選中了後者，遂使沉滯了三千年的社會，只右更沉淪下去，斯亦一大悲劇也。</p>
<p>「對我生財」者，損人利己之總代表。所謂對我，是利己，其中又有排他性，是損人。本來全世界之道德觀念已經弄到非常混賬的地步，大家所尊重的不是道德本身，而是金錢。諸侯之門仁義存焉，無怪唯物論者，謂意識形態度於經濟基礎之上，但在他國，總還有個不成文法，即金錢之獲得，必須是從名譽的工作得來，即使紐約與芝加哥亦有绑票匪，紐約州常常有貪污的事情，畢竟全國人民，從心事對他們是嗤之以鼻，甚至是深惡而痛絕之的，所以國家終於不操縱在損人利己派的手中，大部分財富，也還掌握於福特，加內基，洛基婓勒，杜邦等工業家族之手，絕不像我們中國，以升官爲發財捷徑，以枉法爲自己事業開端。這且不說，只要一個人坐了汽車，擁有洋房，斷斷沒有一個人問一下這些財產的來源，若是發覺他的來路不正，從而以輿論加以制裁。我大胆的分析中國人心理，大約都是狐狸吃不到葡萄就說葡萄是酸的，也許迎我個人都不能保險，眞的到了考臉的塲合，有沒有那麼大的定力。從前曾文正冪府曾有人作了八股說自己對於　婦嬌娃，紅藍大頂都不動心，進於節帥以岡自媒，有某少年儇薄，戲加批云：「　婦嬌娃側，紅藍大頂旁，兩般都不動，只想見中堂！」這是冒充正人君子型，其動機亦不過爾爾，若是根本把良心放在腋下，還有什麼話說，錢鈔是沒有符號的，賊贓與工資，在鈔票方面毫無二致，此爲近代文明一大損失。所繫者，端在民族的集體道德觀念如何耳。在今日，若想使一個書呆子還維持紮緊了褲帶以完成自己的淸高與狷潔，蓋是夢想。即最可靠之人也有七分的不可靠性了。試想誰爲爲之，孰令致之？這個不能說是讀書人不爭氣，社會沒有公平與健康的道德水準，亦即財產標準，乃是吾人日常極大的苦楚，從前還可以說于聲淸高，如今則淸必不高，無他，沒錢則自然不會高耳。社會科學家每喜稱現代文化爲資本主義文化，實則資本主義的生義，雖然不免於剝削，也還有若干造福人類的地方，譬如我們雖反對福時公司之居積財富，可是不能不贊成且利用汽車，則彰影明甚，唯有中國的文化與流行思想，殊不能以資本主義代表，殆只可說是鼠竊狗盜，較之資本主義，相去又有間也。可嘆！</p>
<h3>消遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十章　自願犧牲　（六九）</p>
<p>毓如聽了這一句很是侷促，正要解釋，綺紈又說道：「老先生，我是爽直人，心裏有話就說，不管人家愛聽不愛聽，但我能出口，就能辦得到，我今天在這重重刺激之下，言語不免失態，請你原諒！」毓如見她說話很是剛強，知道她　事一定很看毅力的，　點點頭道；「好，好，我相信你，我極同情你。你太　曲了，你這舍己利人的精神，極堪欽佩！」綺紈道：「這不算什麼，事情既到這地步，就應該這樣辦。但是我有一事要求老先生，老先生今天對我所說的話，我不會告訴別人，我答應老先生的話，希望老先生也不要洩漏出來給渚　知道。因爲他一知道，　態又要發生變化，到那時候我爲私情所縈繞，也許昧了理智，再沒有勇氣踐我諾言。老先生，你趁我這時理智清明，你走吧。我答應你，我就得辦到。」說着站起來，向毓如鞠了一躬。毓如見綺紈忍看滿心苦痛，剛毅神情，溢於言表，心裏非常傾服，一面對綺　點點頭，一面說道：「我欽佩你，我尊重你，我極同情你，希望你不要自苦，就是將來你為環境所迫，不　　踐前言，我也能原諒你。」綺紈道：「老先生，你相信我，我自信必能辦到。」說時，送毓如到門外，毓如把手一拱道：「你要自己珍重。」綺紈含着兩眼淚珠，回到屋內，滿心難過，忍不住伏在床上大哭起來。小王媽　　進房內勸慰，綺紈哭了一氣，把胸中　悶煩惱發洩之後，見小王媽還站在旁邊相勸，　對她說道：「今天徐老先生來我們家，你可別告訴徐先生。」小王媽道：「到底爲什麼事，老板這樣難過？」綺紈道：「你不用問了，以後你自然明白。」小王媽見綺紈滿而不快，不敢多說，祗道：「老板，你不要難過，徐先生是好人，不要聽信別人的閑話。」綺紈道：嗡「我並沒聽別人閃話。」說着緊哎嘴唇，蹙着眉頭，遲疑好一會，突走進臥室，把電話撥動，小王媽跟在她　後，見她拿起聽筒，很簡單地說了幾句話，好似約什麼人見面，一時莫名其妙。綺紈打過電話，便坐在梳妝台前，加意修飾。自從她父親故後，她因居喪，臉上不施脂粉，今天大借助化妝品，抹脂擦粉，描眉涂口紅，頭上散亂燙髮，呌小王媽帮着修飾一番，然後到更衣室，開起衣櫃，揀了一件很鮮艷的花緞旗袍穿上，在鏡前照了一照出來，對小王媽道：「我有事出去，不一定回家吃飯。徐先生來時，若問我上那裏去，你告訴他不知道。」</p>
<h3>遺音錄</h3>
<p>— 銅</p>
<p>紐約文生德氏有　集留聲機片癖，已搜集的聲片計有名人演說二千面，尤其名貴的是因爲那此演說的人物大都故世了。文生德實現了當年愛迪生發明留聲機片的理想：「爲我們下一代保存林肯與華盛頓的聲音和演辭。」</p>
<p>在他的國立的聲樂院裏，你可以聽到佛羅倫斯·南丁格蘭講起她的做護士的工作，或是勞勃·披亞萊講他怎樣發現北極。你可以聽到歷代名人的聲音，如維多利亞女皇，法名女擾本娜，小說家馬克吐溫，柯南道爾爵士，幽默家成爾·羅傑士，約瑟甫皇，美名演員巴楠，無綫電發明家馬可尼，英首相第士累利等。</p>
<p>文生德最動人的一張聲片是歷史上著名的「輕旅團突擊」（美國電影公司曾製片名「英烈傳」）的號角聲。那是由號角手蘭特茀雷於一八九〇年在倫敦錄音，蘭特茀雷是其時突擊之役中唯一的生還者，並用命定的那天同一的　角錄音云。</p>
<h3>論有蛋大家吃</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>前一些時候上海開過一個大會，有一代表致辭，報上對於他的辭只有二句記載：「我們不應該有飯大家吃，而應該大家有飯吃。」（大意如此，原文忘了。）當時看了很覺奇怪：大家有飯吃與有飯大家吃不是半斤與八兩麼，何以前者應該而後者不應該？這疑問一直到昨天在某茶室聽了隔桌二位茶客的閑談才恍然若悟。</p>
<p>甲茶客：英國生活怎麼樣？</p>
<p>乙茶客：苦得很，一人一星期只有一隻鷄蛋可吃。</p>
<p>甲：阿喲媽呀！</p>
<p>乙：但是大家不怨，因爲大家只吃一隻蛋。</p>
<p>甲：大家只吃一隻蛋何以就不怨？</p>
<p>乙：因爲以四千幾百萬只蛋供給四千幾百萬人，有蛋大家吃，何怨之有。</p>
<p>甲：可見人心眞壞，只高興人人和他吃得一樣少，而不樂於人家比他吃得多。</p>
<p>乙：這不能怪人心之壤，而只能怪鷄蛋之少，英國有四千幾百萬人口，而英國的母鷄不能多到每天或每小時產蛋四千幾百萬隻。這一週四千幾百萬隻攪是政府設法弄來的，如果艾德禮每週要吃十七隻，邱吉爾每週要吃二十八隻，其他文官武將富商巨賈每週各要吃三隻四隻，那麼就有人連每半年吃半隻也休想了。</p>
<p>甲：呣。但我想有蛋大家吃，總不如大家有蛋吃。</p>
<p>乙：爲什麼呢？</p>
<p>甲：因爲前者有點覇道而後者才是王道。</p>
<p>乙：說得詳細點。</p>
<p>甲：蛋富營養，大有益於身體，應以多吃爲宜。有蛋大家吃只限於既有之蛋，既有之蛋又非原來人手一隻者，硬分吃了雖均而患寡，患覇。大家有蛋吃則大家競爭吃蛋，雖或有人一小時吃了三四十隻，一人三四十小時只吃到一隻，總比一人一週一隻來得合乎王道。</p>
<p>乙：話也不無道理。但競爭吃蛋的結果，情形必不如你所假想之佳，而是一定有的人因吃蛋吃多了而致疾，有人一無蛋吃而得病</p>
<p>甲：那是活該。誰教他不去弄蛋來吃。</p>
<p>乙：那決不是活該。弄蛋來吃之道無他，或養鷄或去搶而已</p>
<p>甲：還可以買。</p>
<p>乙：不錯，還可以買。但蛋只有這幾隻，你我他搶着買其價必激漲，沒錢的人就永無蛋吃了</p>
<p>甲：那麼去養鷄。</p>
<p>乙：窮人大抵無閑養鷄。闊人也不高興養鷄。</p>
<p>甲：那就沒有辦法了。</p>
<p>乙：每人一隻就是辦法。</p>
<p>甲：但我總覺得大家有蛋吃比較好一點。</p>
<p>乙：我也不一定堅持有蛋大家吃，但有的時候只能有蛋大吃家。譬如我吃茶之後要帶一隻蛋糕回家，小犬有六隻之多，蛋糕只有一塊，於是我說有蛋糕大家吃，一切爲六，人得其一。假如大家有蛋糕吃呢，恐須買三四隻才不致大搶小奪，强有弱無，而我却只有買一塊蛋糕的錢。</p>
<p>聽到這裏我因有事走了，沒有聽到他們的結論，但已於以悟到上述某代表的有飯大家吃與大家有飯吃的不應該與應該，與甲乙二君的大家有蛋吃與有蛋大家吃之爭不無相似之處。不過究竟孰是孰非，却也不敢武斷。</p>
<h3>人與花</h3>
<p>— 蔣度新</p>
<p>從前人喜歡用各種花名譬喻各式女子，又喜歡用「花容月貌」這一成語，形容女子的美貌。而二月八日的申報上的兩段新聞，却又更深一層的告訴了我們一個「人」與「花」對照的事實，那就是：「人比花賤」！</p>
<p>因爲這兩段新聞登載的地位，並不連在一起，所以讀者們也許很難對照了看。這裏，筆者不嫌麻煩，特別將它抄在下面，讓讀者自己去玩味吧！</p>
<p>（一）「合肥七日電：市民張承仁因經濟拮据，年關難渡，竟異想天開，在皖報門旁貼報板上，貼一廣告，大意謂：需款急用，特將幼子出售，只收法幣六百萬元。」</p>
<p>（二）「廣州七日電：舊曆年近，此間羣花上市，牡丹每盆一五〇〇萬元，梅花每枝最高者索價二〇〇〇萬……」</p>
<p>讀了上面這兩段新聞之後，我想讀者總不能無感吧？</p>
<h3>語絲</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>世界是個永久舞毫，所有人類分飾演員，進塲門是助產醫院，出塲門是殯儀館。</p>
<p>世界上沒有對絕的好人與壞人，所謂好人就是一生中所做的好事多於壞事；反之，壞人就是一生中所做的壞事多於好事。</p>
<p>世界上的空間距離因爲科學發達而日趨接近，而人類精神上的距離却愈趨愈遠。</p>
<h3>輕於鴻毛</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>據說飛機在搖籃時代，其時還稱作飛艇的時候，普通人都不敢嘗試，原因是這種新的交通工具太危險，萬一跌下來，粉身碎骨，只是輕於鴻毛的一死而已。所以其時乘飛機的都是一批冒險家和科學家——對於飛機工業有特殊興趣，懷抱着殉道者的仁心，以改善其裝置與設備爲己任的實驗者，才是第一批騰雲駕霧的好漢。</p>
<p>飛機能够改善到現在的設備，從最簡陋的在輕氣球下面盪一隻籃子到今日還在科學家夢想中的飛魚式火箭飛機，以備長征月球之用的過程中，不知道犧牲掉了多少條可寶貴的生命。你說這種死法是輕於鴻毛嗎？其實並不。正因爲生命祗有一次，使製造飛機者不得不審愼從事，每一次失事是一種苦痛的經驗，憑藉這苦痛的經驗才奠定了今日尚未臻於理想，然而已經大有可觀的飛行安全設備。當然，利用了飛機去投擲炸彈，一下子可以燬滅無數生命，這是又當別論，題外文章，姑且不談。</p>
<p>管現代的飛機失事極多，但是還有人去乘坐，其原因即在於飛機本身之功用—它之成爲交通利器，無可否認。所以不能因爲失事而封閉一切空航路綫，眞如因噎之不能廢食相同。</p>
<p>但是有一種本身並無價值，而足以危害生命的東西，事實上應行廢止的，倒並未見到當局的制止，坐使不可復得的生命像鴻毛一般輕易消失掉了，抑何可悲呢？這是什麼東西？便是我曾經在本談中呼籲過應在打倒之列的摜砲。自從上一篇文字發表之後，接一連二的慘劇曾經在報上登載過，關心社會新聞版者當能知道，此地不再列舉。本月五日又發生了兩起慘劇，一是住在警亭路的呂姓靑年，做金錢炮生意，因存貨爆炸，遍體鱗傷，送醫院後即死去。又一是浦東陳某，批來大量摜炮，不慎落地爆炸，左足當塲炸斷，頭手等部亦重傷云云。</p>
<p>做摜炮生意的人是爲了生活，結果是自焚其身，正如飛蛾撲燈，足爲今日之玩火者戒。而他們的炸死，對於摜炮本身並無好處，眞正是輕於鴻毛的了，我們不知道摜炮有什麼理由還要它存在！如其因爲是美國歡迎，可以藉此換取外匯，從而不去禁止其生產，眞是與「月　外國的好」同樣地荒謬絕倫！</p>
<h3>瘋子</h3>
<p>— 芳濟</p>
<p>街上走着一個俄羅斯人，忽然自言自語的說道：「我們的政府裏全是一班流氓，他們唯一的政策只是在愚弄百姓呀！」</p>
<p>警察立刻走過來，拉住了他的衣裟不放，那個路人的朋友走來辯護着說：「你不要抓着他，他是一個瘋子呀！」</p>
<p>警察說：「嘿！如果他眞是瘋子，他怎會知道得這樣詳畫而且準確呢？」</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Report on the Recent International Situation at the Council Meeting: Striving to Revive the World Economy and Prevent the Resurgence of Militarism; We Are Determined to Overcome the Current Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Council held a routine meeting on the morning of the 13th, chaired by Jiang Yong. The meeting was of a confidential nature and invited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to report on the recent international situation and diplomacy. Subsequently, the following proposals were discussed: (1) Zheng Kuiyi et al. proposed that the salaries of faculty and staff in national colleges and universities be equalized. A resolution was passed to request the government to consider and implement it. (2) Xue Mingjian et al. proposed that the government pay attention to the processing of Taiwan's native products to increase foreign exchange earnings. A resolution was passed to request the government to pay close attention to it. (3) The same proposers proposed that the government clarify electoral administration, hoping that the government could maintain the independence of the judiciary, handle matters in accordance with the law, and not exert pressure through political force. A resolution was passed to request the government to pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang's report at the Council meeting was subsequently published in writing. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Peace Treaty with Japan and World Economic Recovery: China has always longed for and strived for the early conclusion of a peace treaty because the early realization of world peace can help the world economy return to normal as soon as possible. However, since successive foreign ministers' meetings failed to reach an agreement, the hope for an early conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Japan has dimmed. We should not abandon the desire to complete the European and Far Eastern peace treaties. However, to argue that economic recovery should be discussed only after there is peace is also a waste of time. Regarding the recovery of the world economy, China not only supports any plan to restore the losses of the Allied countries but also hopes to see the economic recovery of the enemy countries. However, all plans to restore the economy of the enemy countries must be able to ensure that militarism will not be revived. World peace is indivisible, and the world's economic recovery is equally indivisible.</p>
<p>(2) U.S. Aid to China: This matter is currently under consideration by the U.S. government. Regarding this matter, I believe that the ten self-help plans announced by Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and approved by the State Council must be implemented as much as possible. Those that can be implemented without waiting for foreign aid should be implemented immediately. Only by earnestly implementing this plan can China's economy achieve self-reliance through self-help. Indeed, the difficulties China faces today are as serious as those during the most difficult period of the War of Resistance. The National Government overcame those difficulties at that time. We should uphold the same determination and belief to overcome the current major crisis.</p>
<p>Kowloon City and Shameen Cases: China and Britain Discuss Appropriate Solutions</p>
<p>(3) Siamese Coup: When the coup occurred in Siam last year, our government decided to temporarily postpone recognition of the new Siamese regime to observe the extent to which the Siamese people supported the new regime. Our adoption of this attitude is merely following a universally recognized international practice. At the same time, our government's policy of absolute non-interference in Siam's internal affairs will never publicly or secretly support or oppose any Siamese political groups. Our government has not only instructed its ambassadors and consular officials stationed in Siam to abide by this principle but has also, to the best of their ability, persuaded Chinese expatriates to avoid participating in Siam's domestic political struggles. We have suffered greatly from the various plots of Japanese government officials to interfere in China's internal affairs before the war. We are determined not to impose on others what we do not want for ourselves. Our government is closely monitoring the evolution of the situation in Siam.</p>
<p>(4) Kowloon City Incident and Shameen Incident: Regarding the Kowloon City incident, the Chinese and British governments have both proposed solutions and are currently discussing them with each other. I firmly believe that in seeking a just solution, the Chinese government's legal position and the public health concerns of the Kowloon Leased Territory authorities should be fully considered. As for the Shameen incident, both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior have sent personnel to Guangdong for investigation. The report will be submitted to the Ministry soon, and our government will discuss an appropriate solution to this incident with the British side based on the report.</p>
<h3>Allocation Guidelines for Import Quotas for the Fifth and Sixth Seasons Announced Yesterday; Fertilizers, Coal, Rice, Wheat, etc. Changed to Approval on a Case-by-Case Basis</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The examination team of the National Economic Council completed the examination of the import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons on the morning of the 13th. The quota allocation table was originally scheduled to be announced at 3:00 PM on the 13th, but it was postponed because it still needed to be approved by the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 14th. However, the key points of the quota allocation were announced by Gu Yuchuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, at 5:00 PM on the 13th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the quotas for the import of goods into our country from foreign countries in the fifth and sixth seasons, the Export Management Committee of the Executive Yuan has carefully considered them. On the one hand, it is to cooperate with the national budget, and on the other hand, it must take into account factory production. A preliminary allocation table has been drawn up and submitted to the National Economic Council for deliberation on the 12th. In principle, it was approved, and eight members, including Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, Huo Shishu, Jie Guansan, and Lou Tongsun, and Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuchuan were appointed to make the final revisions. A review meeting was held on the morning of the 13th, chaired by Vice President Wang. After carefully reviewing the ten-point statement of economic and financial self-help issued by Premier Zhang and the principles of increasing production and saving consumption, the results of the review have been reported to Chairman Zhang, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation so that domestic manufacturers have a sufficient period to plan their own plans. The newly revised allocation table mentioned above has the following changes compared with the original one: (1) In the past, a quota was set for each season. Now, in order to cooperate with the national budget, it has been changed to a combined quota for two seasons (i.e., half a year). (2) The content of the newly revised allocation table does not include cotton from the fourth quarter onwards. Now, fertilizers, coal, rice, wheat, etc. have all been changed to not include quotas and will be approved on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs. (3) The original quota for small cars in the fourth quarter was 500 vehicles. Because the number of vehicles arriving at the port is considerable, the government has formulated other handling methods. The proposed quota for the fifth and sixth seasons is 500 vehicles, which will still not be given foreign exchange according to previous examples. (4) The original quota for metal products in the fourth quarter was US$4.5 million. Now, the total quota for the fifth and sixth seasons is set at US$7 million. Although it seems to be reduced by US$1.1 million per season, the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau and the Post-War Enterprise Committee still have a considerable amount of surplus US military materials that can be used, and there are considerable restrictions on the export of metal products from foreign countries. (5) The original quota for medicines in the fourth quarter was US$600,000. Now, the total quota for the fifth and sixth seasons is US$400,000, a reduction of US$800,000. Because US aid medicines will be shipped to China one after another, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) supplies of medicines owned by the Health Commission of the Executive Yuan, worth more than US$10 million, have been distributed one after another. Therefore, the current quota is based on the supply of raw materials for pharmaceutical manufacturing. (6) Paper and pulp will be imported in accordance with the regulations of the National Economic Council, with more finished paper products being imported and more pulp being imported to provide raw materials for paper mills to increase production and gradually reduce the import of domestically manufactured paper. (7) Tobacco leaves are generally considered to be purely consumer goods. In the current difficult social situation, it is especially important to strive to save consumption, and there is also domestic production. Therefore, the quota is reduced. Overall, the newly revised import allocation quota table for the fifth and sixth seasons seems to have been reduced significantly on the surface. If the various items not listed in the quota are combined, the reduction is very small compared with the original quota for the fourth quarter. At present, my country's foreign exchange is in difficulty, and we have to live within our means. I believe that all manufacturers will understand this. Although international aid in negotiations is very optimistic, we cannot rely entirely on foreign aid. Even if friendly countries provide a large amount of aid, we should still strive to save and increase the source of foreign exchange. During the implementation period of the import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons, the import quotas will be approved on a case-by-case basis as needed, according to the importance and urgency, in order to benefit both the national economy and people's livelihood."</p>
<h3>Of the Imported Industrial Products, More Raw Materials Should Be Imported</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The review meeting of the National Economic Council on the quota for the fifth and sixth seasons has fully allocated and approved the quotas on the 13th. The total amount for the two seasons is US$74.72 million, with an average of US$37.36 million per season, which is about 30% less than the quota of US$53 million for the fourth quarter. In this allocation table, diesel oil has the largest figure, with a total of US$18 million. Because diesel oil is needed in many places such as ships, automobiles, and industry, it is only reduced by US$50,000 compared to the quota for the fourth quarter. The quota for gasoline has been reduced compared to the past. The original gasoline quota for the fourth quarter was US$2.97 million, and the two seasons have now been reduced to US$2.5 million per season. However, the quota for civil aviation gasoline will not be reduced, and it is only specially hoped that gasoline for automobiles in large cities should be saved especially. The quota for kerosene has been slightly reduced compared to the past. The quota for tobacco leaves in the fourth quarter was US$5 million, which has now been changed to US$8 million for the two seasons. The white paper for the fifth season is equal to the fourth quarter, still at US$4.5 million. The amount for the sixth season has not yet been approved, and the figure will be approved after considering the increase in domestic newspaper production. Wang Yunwu once proposed that the quota for newspapers should be relaxed, but because the newspapers allocated in the fourth quarter have not been fully imported, the fifth season will remain the same as the fourth quarter for the time being, only without reducing the quota. The quota for small cars for the two seasons is a total of 500 vehicles, including the cars used by the personnel of the embassies and legations of various countries in China, which has been reduced by half compared to 500 vehicles for one season in the fourth quarter. The quota for trucks is listed as US$625,000 per season, and the accessories are also included, which is equivalent to more than 200 vehicles. The machine belt part is deleted. In addition, the quota for this firewood in the quota has been reduced compared to the past, and the use has also been restricted. Regarding the import of chemical products, it is stipulated that raw materials for production should be the main body, and finished products should be reduced. The quota for wool in the table has not been revised and has not increased or decreased compared to the fourth quarter. The reason is that the woolen fabrics made of wool can be used for military and police uniforms. In addition, the review meeting on the morning of the 13th also decided on the following three principles: (1) Among the non-quota imports, it is stipulated that instruments, books, and educational supplies will still maintain US$500,000 per season; (2) Among all kinds of imported industrial products, more raw materials should be imported to increase domestic production and should be allocated to factories first (less to exporters); (3) The import of fuels such as gasoline and diesel should be limited to public utilities.</p>
<h3>Kowloon City Hostel Completed During the Spring Festival</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 13th] Kowloon City, which has attracted much attention, still spent the Spring Festival in peace and quiet. The hostel built jointly by the residents of Guangzhou after the demolition of the entire city was completed during the Spring Festival. It is named "Kowloon City Residents' Joint Association of Bao'an County." More than a thousand tourists visited the hostel every day during the Spring Festival. Seeing the residents' distressed tents, suffering from hunger and cold, they could not help but silently donate money to comfort them. In addition, the representative Liu Ziliang was suddenly arrested by the Hong Kong side on New Year's Eve, causing a temporary commotion. People thought that a new incident had occurred, but he was released soon. As for the two representatives, Zhu and Liu, who are in prison, the 13th happened to be the first month of their imprisonment. In addition to sending representatives to visit and comfort them in prison, the residents also urged Guo Dehua to negotiate their release again.</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai Talks About China's Politics and Finance in the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 12th] Zhang Junmai, leader of the China Democratic Socialist Party, recently declared that China's one-party system is coming to an end forever. Although the Kuomintang is still the largest political party, other small parties will be able to obtain seats in the government, such as cabinet ministers. Speaking at the Chamber of Commerce here, Zhang said: If the Communist Party had not been lured by the Soviet Union to take over the Northeast, its flames would have been suppressed long ago. Although internal and external affairs are in progress, some political reforms, such as financial reform and control, stabilization of the currency system, and assistance to commerce and agriculture, will be implemented quickly. Zhang continued: Despite the contrary arguments and reports, China's friendship with the United States has not diminished at all. We have received much assistance and advice from the United States, and we are very grateful for this. China is proud to stand among the major countries in the world that oppose communism.</p>
<h3>Torrential Spring Rain in Mount Lu</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 13th] Torrential spring rain fell on Mount Lu on the 13th. Chairman Chiang and his wife rested in their official residence all day. They visited the Immortal Cave the day before and inspected the library.</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui and Others Visit Zhang Qun to Express the Wishes of the People in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Mo Dehui, Yu Bin, Liu Zhe, Wang Huipu, Guan Jiyu, and others visited Premier Zhang at the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM on the 13th to express the wishes of the people in the Northeast to the government. Zhang said that the central government not only attaches great importance to the situation in the Northeast but also has great confidence in it. Mo and others were all satisfied.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Delegation Returns Home, Arrives in Hong Kong by Ship and Will Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] The Legislative Yuan delegation of four members led by Wu Shangying, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, arrived here this morning on the General Meiqi transport ship after completing a broad survey trip in Europe and the United States on their way back home. The ship will sail to Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<h3>U.S. Relief Funds for China Purchase Second Batch of Grain; State Department Notifies Embassy in China</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Nanjing, 14th] The U.S. State Department today notified the Embassy in China regarding the use of the US$18.3 million appropriated by Congress on December 23 last year to increase U.S. relief assistance to China. More than US$15.5 million will be used to obtain wheat and rice, US$1 million will be used for medical supplies, and US$500,000 will be used for insecticides and grain seeds.</p>
<p>This fund will be included in the US$27.7 million originally stipulated. The funds are currently being handled by the Embassy's China Relief Committee in accordance with the relief agreement signed between the United States and China on October 27 last year. The majority of the US$27.7 million originally stipulated was used to purchase grain, a considerable amount of which has already arrived in China or is crossing the ocean to come here.</p>
<p>To improve the utilization of imported grain, the Chinese government has adopted a rationing system in the coastal urban centers. These efforts have made progress. In view of this, the U.S. State Department has approved that the majority of the newly allocated funds will be used to purchase wheat and rice again. Therefore, more than US$15 million will be used for this purpose, and it is expected that China will obtain another 19,000 tons of wheat and 48,000 tons of rice, including transportation costs. After all of these materials are shipped to China within the next three months, the U.S. food donation under the current relief plan will be 190,000 tons, of which 70,000 tons will be wheat, and the rest will be rice.</p>
<p>The Chinese government is expected to announce soon its plan to implement a food rationing system using these materials and other important food supplies. The plan will ensure that the populous coastal urban centers will receive an adequate minimum supply of food during the months of food panic in late winter and spring.</p>
<p>Another US$1 million in surplus funds is currently being held in custody pending further consideration. It is expected that gasoline and diesel will be imported to China to cooperate with another special program to promote the transportation of grain produced in China from surplus areas to areas where there is insufficient supply, and to use the existing transportation mechanisms more effectively to ensure the rapid and equal distribution of relief supplies. The details of this part of the program are still being discussed with the Chinese government, so the details of the planned transportation program will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Some financial experts said that the Chinese legal currency cannot be reorganized. The amount of legal currency issued is so large that any loan within the capacity of the country is not enough to restore its original value. Others said that the Chinese currency can be reorganized if it adopts a coin standard, such as a silver standard. However, this reorganization requires about 500 million ounces of silver, or even more than 500 million ounces. It is doubtful whether the U.S. has this amount. The United States currently has only about 100 million ounces of silver that is not designated for use and can be lent to China, which is like a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. According to what is known here, many bankers and other financial figures in China believe that adopting a silver standard is the only way to prevent currency devaluation. However, they did not specify where to get the silver.</p>
<h3>The City of Beiping Purchased 32.4 Billion Worth of Finished Products</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Before the old year, the National Bank entrusted national banks and bureaus to purchase finished products. The purchase has now ended. A total of 32.4 billion was spent on finished products in Beiping, of which coal accounted for 22.6 billion. Small industrial loans totaled 17.6 billion, and handicraft loans totaled 30 billion, which have not yet been fully lent out. The National Bank's purchase of finished products and loans this time did not cause significant stimulation to the financial market because the amount was not large.</p>
<h3>Chu Xichun Returns to Beiping and Says Baoding's Safety Can Be Guaranteed</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Ji Yuxi Chu Xichun returned to Beiping from Baoding at 4:00 PM on the 13th. According to reports, he exchanged opinions with representatives from the party, government, military, and civilian circles in Baoding. Although the provincial government cannot work in Baoding at present, its attention to Baoding has not diminished. It is currently studying a specific plan for military and political cooperation with Commander Chuan. All policies are based on military needs. If the military is confident, it will not be a problem for the provincial government to be in Beiping or Baoding. People from all walks of life in Baoding have understood this, and the cooperation between the party, government, military, and civilians is commendable. The safety of Baoding is definitely not a problem. Chu will continue to inspect Tianjin within days.</p>
<h3>Liao Chairman Xu Zhen Resigns; Dong Wenqi Is Rumored to Be the Mayor of Shenyang Again</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 13th] Shenyang Mayor Jin Zhen's resignation was approved. Dong Wenqi is rumored to be the most popular candidate to be reappointed. In addition, Liao Ning Province Chairman Xu Zhen also resigned.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Arrives in Lanzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 13th] Director Zhang Zhizhong flew to Lanzhou from Xi'an at 11:30 AM on the 13th. Deputy Directors Tao Zhiyue, Guo Jiyu, Ma Bufang, and heads of various agencies went to the airport to greet him. It has not yet been decided when Zhang will return to Xinjiang.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Ninth Pacification Zone Li Liangrong Arrives in Yishui to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Our Linyi Dispatch, 13th] The newly appointed Commander of the Ninth Pacification Zone and Commander of the 23rd Army Li Liangrong arrived in Linyi from Beijing on the 11th to officially take office. Li is from Fujian and graduated from the first class of the Huangpu Military Academy.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in the Zhunge'er Banner of Yimeng Have Been Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 13th] The Communist bandits in the Zhunge'er Banner of Yimeng have been completely eliminated by the National Army after being harassed by the Communist bandits for a while. However, the Communist bandits occupied the Shili Changtan area on the opposite bank of Hekou. This place has been the base of military and political personnel in Hekou County in recent years. The loss was great this time. The Pingjing Banner of Ulanqab League is peaceful. The Bailing Temple area in the banner is guarded by the National Army. The rumor that Outer Mongolia is building a highway to Bailing Temple is not true. Liu Wanchun, Commander of Southern Sui, recently returned to Sui from Helin. According to reports, Helingele, Toketo, and Liangcheng in Southern Sui are very peaceful recently.</p>
<h3>There Are No Signs of Advocating the Abolition of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty on August 21, 1937 (26th year of the Republic of China) for the purpose of good-neighborly relations. The last clause of the treaty stipulates that the validity period is five years. If one of the contracting parties believes that there is no need to continue, it shall notify the other party six months before the expiration date, otherwise it shall continue to be valid for two years. The treaty first expired in 1942 (31st year of the Republic of China) and has been extended twice since then. It will expire in August of this year. It is reported that although China and the Soviet Union are considering this issue, there are no signs of advocating the abolition of the treaty. The relations between China and the Soviet Union are still quite friendly. If neither party raises any objections by the 21st of this month, it will be extended for another two years. Sources revealed that advocating the abolition of the treaty would indicate a major change in the relations between the two countries. It is expected that neither China nor the Soviet Union will do this at this time, and the treaty will be automatically extended for another two years.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Launched an Offensive in Northern Shenyang; National Army in Taonan Recaptured Shahe; Anshan Is Tense and the Steel Plant Has Been Shut Down</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 13th] After the bandits were defeated in Jinan, they launched an offensive in northern Shenyang on the morning of the 12th. There were more than 10,000 bandits who were harassing the area east and west of Shifosi, 40 kilometers north of Shenyang. On the 13th, the National Army was attacking them in the Wandao Terrace area, 25 kilometers northwest of Shenyang, and the area 35 kilometers north of Shenyang. The National Army in Taonan recovered Shahe on the 12th, and the siege of Sujiatun was lifted. However, the bandits increased their troops around Anshan, and the bandits south of Qianshan moved frequently, attempting to attack Anshan.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The iron capital Anshan is tense. There was contact on the west and northwest sides on the afternoon of the 12th. Dense artillery fire was heard in the city. The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant has been shut down, and the custodial staff continues to be dismissed, leaving a part of the personnel to be responsible for custody.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The isolated Laixi Coal Mine has recently significantly increased production, from 1,500 tons per day to 10,000 kilowatts of electricity. Because the line is blocked, it stopped supplying Shenyang, so production increased. The Shenyang-Tiehling Railway is interrupted, and employees are working calmly. The mine has abundant coal reserves.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The remnants of Lin's Ninth Column of bandits who were harassing the Daling River area of the Northern Ninglu Railway were chased by the National Army and began to retreat towards Goubangzi on the morning of the 12th. The war on that line has improved.</p>
<h3>Eastern Henan Enters the Pacification Stage; National Army in Western Shandong Recaptures Caoxian</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] After the remnants of Chen Yi's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns retreated to Western Shandong, the Eastern Henan area has entered the pacification stage. At present, most of Chen's bandits in the areas north and south of the Longhai Railway have been eliminated. The National Army in Western Shandong recovered Caoxian County on the afternoon of the 12th. The National Army sweeping the Chayekou area west of Boshan in central Shandong seized 10,000 catties of bandit food and 2,000 dans of salt, several machine guns and submachine guns, and more than 200 rifles by the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 13th] The future actions of Chen Yi's bandit troops who retreated to Western Shandong are being closely watched by all parties. Some say that the bandits may cross the Yellow River and retreat north to support the war in North China. At present, there are only more than 2,000 local Eighth Route Army troops in Yanling and Fugou in eastern Henan, and more than 1,000 in Weichuan.</p>
<p>[Our Fuyang Dispatch, 13th] About 10,000 people from the First Column of Liu Bocheng's troops who fled from Wulongji, Xixian, to Taihe gathered in the Jieshou tax town area and took measures to coordinate with Wei Fenglou, Jin Shaoshan, and other troops in Taikang and Huaiyang. The local Communists Wei Jie and Qiao Daosan are active and the Anhui border defense army is advancing to search and suppress them.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] On the 12th, the National Army in Jianghan swept eastward from Hao Xue and defeated a remnant of the Jianghan Independent Brigade of bandits consisting of 500 troops in the area east of Pujiguan, and continued to pursue them victoriously.</p>
<h3>China-France Air Transport Agreement; France Has Submitted a Draft; Relevant Authorities Are Reviewing It</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs news: According to the exchange of notes between China and France on the provisional measures for the China-Vietnam airline in December 1946, both parties shall, during the effective period of the provisional measures, negotiate a broad air transport agreement. The French Embassy in China submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the end of last year a draft of the air transport agreement between China and France. The content is roughly the same as the China-UK air transport agreement signed in July last year and is currently being reviewed by the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Stipulates the Targets of the Self-Defense Special Donation; No Additional Levy on Central Tax Sources</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Among the resolutions of the Central China Five Provinces Pacification Conference a month ago, there was a proposal to levy a special self-defense donation. The collection method is to levy 100,000 yuan per dan of salt, and other cotton, grain, tobacco, alcohol, and mineral products of various provinces are taxed in proportion. According to the Ministry of Finance, the various provinces have requested funding for the establishment of security teams, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan and forwarded by the Ministry of Finance. The funding will be subsidized by the central government by two-thirds, and the local governments will raise one-third themselves, but the local governments shall not use central taxes as the source of funds for double taxation.</p>

<h3>Deng Wenyi Reports to Reporters on the Overall Situation of the War and Guarantees That This Year's Bandit Suppression Achievements Will Be Better Than Last Year's</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, and Deng Wenyi, Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, jointly hosted a reception at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 12:00 noon yesterday for the responsible persons of various Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city. Among those present were Pan Gongzhan, Chen Xun, Feng Youzhen, Wang Yunsheng, Zhao Heng, Zhan Wenhuh, and over thirty others. Director Dong first stood up to give a speech, introducing Director Deng Wenyi, and expressed the hope that the press in this city could have more contact with Mr. Deng in the future. The Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense will send several personnel to be stationed in Shanghai for a long period to release war news. Everything is being planned and arranged and is expected to be realized in the short term. After Mr. Dong's report, Mr. Deng immediately stood up amidst the applause and gave a detailed report on the overall situation of bandit suppression. He concluded his speech at around 2:00 PM. The full text of his speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>It has been almost two years since the Communist bandits, led by Li Xiannian's Central Plains Military Region, suddenly launched a rebellion in the spring of the year before last. In the past two years of suppressing bandits and saving the people, the National Army has experienced many extremely difficult and dangerous battles. The National Army suffered 500,000 casualties, including deaths and missing, while more than 1.3 million bandit troops were eliminated, roughly a ratio of one to three. Calculating the entire campaign, the National Army has indeed been victorious. This can be proven by the fact that the Communist bandits have been shouting "counter-offensive" and "general counter-offensive" since the summer of last year. What is the actual situation of the recent war? Here is a comprehensive review.</p>
<p>1.  Northeast Battlefield</p>
<p>Currently, the Northeast battlefield is the most important to all parties, and everyone is very worried about the safety of Shenyang. In fact, the bandit troops currently roaming in Liaoning and southern Liaoning consist of ten columns, totaling about 200,000 people. Apart from trying to cut off Shenyang's land and sea transportation supply lines, they do not have the strength to attack Shenyang. The attacks by small bandit units in the suburbs of Shenyang are merely disruptive in nature, because the strength of the National Army's troops near Shenyang exceeds that of the bandit troops. As long as the Communist bandits dare to challenge Shenyang, they can be defeated at any time. The National Army will never give up the Northeast. Its strategy is to firmly defend strategic strongholds such as Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and Sipingjie, as the foundation for recovering the entire Northeast in the future. The war in the Northeast is a long-term and arduous one, and it needs the support of the whole country. However, the current situation is not as serious as outsiders claim.</p>
<p>2.  North China Battlefield</p>
<p>The strength of the Communist bandit Nie Rongzhen in North China is only six columns, less than 120,000 people. Nie Rongzhen has always been a commander who suffers defeats. He was lucky enough to capture Shijiazhuang last winter, but the battle to harass the Peiping-Tientsin-Baoding area in December failed again. In the Yanqing and Laishui-Mancheng areas of Chahar, they lost 30,000 people. Only the 32nd Division of the National Army suffered relatively large casualties, less than 4,000 people. The troops commanded by Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi are more than double the number of Communist bandits. The defenses of Peiping, Tientsin, Baoding, and various transportation lines have been strengthened. The recent sweeping operations are proceeding very smoothly. The war situation in North China will gradually improve from now on.</p>
<p>3.  Shanxi-Shaanxi Battlefield</p>
<p>The lair of the Communist bandits Mao Zedong and Zhu De is now in northern Shanxi, defended by less than 40,000 remnants led by He Long. Peng Dehuai has about 50,000 people in northern Shaanxi and has failed to return to Yan'an, failing to capture Qingjian after three attempts. Wang Zhen led about 30,000 people in southern Shanxi in response. Although they claim to have a total of 100,000 people, their strength is weak. Director Yan Xishan has more than enough strength to firmly defend Taiyuan. As long as the National Army launches a large-scale campaign, the defeat of the Communist bandits there will be easier than the progress of last year's Shaanxi and Shandong campaigns.

<h3>Using Tanggu New Port to Strengthen North Coal South Transportation, The First Transportation Ship Sailed to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 13th] The realization of North Coal South Transportation at Tanggu New Port has been announced. After coal from Mentougou and Kailuan successively arrived at the new port, the first transportation ship, the “Yiguang” arrived at the new port on the 11th. On the 12th, the port used its self-generating electricity to load 1,500 tons of coal with its coal loading machine, which took only seven hours. The ship left the port on the 13th for Shanghai. This is the first sound of North Coal South Transportation via the New Port.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 13th] The current North Coal South Transportation is actively improving transportation technology issues. The first wharf of the Tianjin Tanggu New Port has been deepened to reach six meters, which can simultaneously berth six 3,000-ton ships. The coal loading machine at the second wharf has been repaired and can load 200-300 tons of coal per hour. The original railway branch lines have also been increased by one, and the coal storage has been expanded to store 20,000 tons of coal. In the future, the export of coal from Kailuan, Datong, and Mentougou will be even more convenient.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>This Year Will Definitely Be Better Than Last Year!</h3>
<p>"The plan for a year lies in spring." Now that the Spring Festival is over, the whole country is making plans for all political and business affairs this year. Let us first infer the trend of the military suppression of bandits this year based on the war situation report made by Director Deng of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense to the press in Shanghai yesterday and say: "This year will definitely be better than last year."</p>
<p>Speaking of bandit suppression, we must first admit that the government initially lost a move. Why? Because the government was broad-minded and overly believed in the untrustworthy Communist bandits. Because the government was initially constrained by General Marshall's mediation, it wishfully wanted to try the path of peaceful negotiation, and some politicians in the country also vigorously supported this, thinking that the Communist bandits were ultimately Chinese, or had humanity, or still knew patriotism, but they did not know they were being fooled. It was not until the Communist bandits blocked the road to peace that the government finally decided to suppress the rebellion. In military terms, it can be said that it was a late move and suffered a great loss.</p>
<p>However, it is not too late to mend the fold after a sheep is lost. In the past battles, the National Army captured the old nest of the Communist bandits in Yan'an, swept away the base of Chen Yi's bandit troops in the Yimeng Mountains, and recovered the "warehouse" in northern Jiangsu occupied by the Communist bandits, which has indeed yielded great gains. According to Director Deng's report, although the National Army suffered 500,000 casualties, including deaths and missing, in the arduous and dangerous struggle, it eliminated more than 1.3 million bandit troops, nearly a ratio of one to three. This is because although the bandit troops have the weapons of the Japanese invaders, although there are Japanese, Koreans, and Mongolians helping them, and although the Soviet Union is backing them, they ultimately violate the national consciousness and cannot muster the will to fight in their conscience. Moreover, the old cadres and veteran soldiers of the bandit troops are almost completely wiped out, and the new soldiers are often deceived and coerced to come, and their combat will is naturally even more depressed. In addition, the internal divisions and struggles of the Communist bandits are becoming more and more serious day by day. Most of the cadres are either being purged or are gradually wavering. On the National Army side, although morale was somewhat affected for a period of time due to the poisoning of the "political consultation" atmosphere and the stimulation of reorganizing the army and cutting officers, after the government decided to suppress the rebellion and fought hard for more than a year, the psychology of common hatred for the enemy in the troops became stronger and stronger day by day due to the lessons of blood and experience learned by the soldiers and the improvement of the bandit suppression strategy and tactics. The entire bandit suppression war will inevitably become smoother with the passage of time.</p>
<p>Due to the revitalization of the morale of the National Army, the importance and strengthening of local self-defense forces, and the gradual implementation of local politics, especially the rural land distribution work, in coordination with the military, we believe that the National Army's achievements in suppressing bandits will certainly be better this year than last year, as Director Deng said. Looking at the situation of each battlefield: we absolutely support the government's new strategy. At this stage, we must firmly defend the strongholds in the Northeast, and at the same time, we must protect the passages in North China and eliminate the entire area of Central and East China. We believe that the National Army will never give up the Northeast. The National Army must firmly defend the large strongholds in the Northeast, such as Changchun, Shenyang, Jilin, and Siping, as the foundation for recovering the entire Northeast in the future. In the mainland, General Fu Zuoyi is the most suitable person to be in charge of bandit suppression in North China. Under his command, the National Army will use its mobility to cooperate with progressive local politics and the people's self-defense forces. There will be no room for the Communist bandits to gain a foothold in North China, and we dare to predict that the major transportation lines departing from Peiping will be completely opened up in the near future. After the reorganization of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in East China and Central China, command will be unified, troops will be concentrated, and new tactics will be adopted to deal with the Communist bandits' conspiracies and tricks. At the same time, if we can better understand the hidden circumstances that most of the bandit troops are coerced rather than willing, and implement both suppression and appeasement, giving the Communist bandits a way to repent and rehabilitate themselves, then not only will Chen Yi's bandit troops on the border of Shandong and Jiangsu inevitably be cleared, but also the illusions of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's bandit troops running around and becoming bandits in the Dabie Mountains, Tongbai Mountains, Funiu Mountains, and Dahong Mountains will be shattered by the National Army. At present, the political center of the country is in the capital, and the economic center is in Shanghai. Ensuring the safety of Nanjing and Shanghai is equivalent to defending the heart of the country. And clearing the Communist bandits north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River, so that there is no gap for the Communist bandits to gain a foothold and harass on the entire area of this land, is the most urgent strategy for bandit suppression. And with this strategy, under the major premise of common belief between the government and the public and cooperation between the military and the people, we believe that it will be successfully completed.</p>
<p>We dare to say that this year will definitely be better than last year; at the same time, we earnestly hope that the government and the public will work harder this year than last year!</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On the National General Budget for This Year (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Sixth is the issue of government domestic and foreign debt reorganization. Before the War of Resistance, debt expenditure accounted for approximately 30% or more of China's total fiscal expenditure. Part of this fiscal burden was the reparations left by the Manchu Qing government, and part was the domestic and foreign debts left by the Northern Warlord government era. In order to maintain China's national credit, our National Government still endured and bore this unreasonable burden. After the outbreak of the war, many new domestic and foreign debts were incurred, so the fiscal pressure of debt will make China's finances never sound.</p>
<p>According to the author's statistics, the principal and interest payable on public bonds in legal tender units from before the war to 1944, from 1948 to 1981, totaled 27.765539 billion yuan. During the same period, the principal and interest payable on public bonds in foreign currency and customs gold units, from 1948 to 1967, totaled approximately 3.761 trillion yuan (converted according to the Central Bank's foreign exchange rates). The two totaled approximately 3.8 trillion yuan. The following is a table:</p>

<p>1942 Allied Victory US Dollar Public Bond (from 1948 to 1953) US Dollar 82,000,000</p>
<p>In addition, the 1934 June British Gold Gengkuan Public Bond and the 1941 Yunnan-Burma Railway Gold Public Bond, issued by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with various ministries, have not yet been included. Summarizing the above various public bonds, the principal and interest payable on customs gold public bonds is 93,057,500 customs gold units, which is equivalent to 1.946115 billion yuan when converted at 20 yuan per customs gold unit. The principal and interest payable on British gold public bonds is 24,501,750 pounds, which is equivalent to 1.176 trillion yuan when converted at the Central Bank's rate of 48,000 yuan per pound; if converted at the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's rate of 413,000 yuan per pound, it would be 10.11922275 trillion yuan. The principal and interest payable on US dollar public bonds is 215,418,750 US dollars, which is equivalent to 2.585 trillion yuan when converted at the Central Bank's rate of 12,000 yuan per dollar; if converted at the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's rate of 131,500 yuan per dollar, it would be 28.327565625 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>According to the author's opinion, the purchase of public bonds during wartime should be treated equally, because the act of purchasing national currency unit or customs gold unit public bonds and purchasing foreign currency unit public bonds is originally the same in nature, but the principal and interest of national currency public bonds or customs gold unit public bonds are still paid according to the face value, which in fact has suffered considerable losses, while those who purchase foreign currency unit public bonds have not been affected by price increases. This is obviously extremely unfair. Therefore, the author suggests that the Ministry of Finance should base the repayment of principal and interest on foreign currency unit domestic public bonds on the Central Bank's exchange rate, and never on the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's rate. Although holders of foreign currency unit public bonds also suffer losses, the extent of their losses is definitely not as low as that of holders of national currency unit public bonds.</p>
<p>If the government really wants to repay British gold and US dollar public bonds based on the Central Bank's exchange rate, then from January 1948 to 1967, the payable principal and interest converted into legal tender would be 3.761 trillion yuan, which the government's treasury definitely has the power to repay in one go.</p>
<p>If the government wants to maintain the superficial credit of the country and implement repayment in new currency after currency reform, then it is firmly believed that such a huge amount of public debt will bankrupt the treasury, and the original intention to maintain the superficial credit of the country will result in the loss of the actual credit of the country! We must know that the soundness of national finances symbolizes the soundness of all aspects of the country's economy, politics, and culture, and also the welfare of the entire people. If we insist on maintaining debt credit and bankrupt the finances, it will not only be the misfortune of the country and the government, but also the misfortune of the entire nation. In particular, the burden of repaying the principal and interest of foreign currency year-end public bonds during wartime falls on the national treasury, and the national treasury cannot but increase taxes on the people, resulting in a greater imbalance in wealth distribution, which will cause drastic changes in social order. This is a short-sighted measure that is not suitable for the national economy and the people's livelihood!</p>
<p>The source of funds for repaying this type of domestic public debt is to be raised through prize-winning public bonds. As the author mentioned earlier, if the government implements a prize-winning public bond policy, it can receive 100 trillion yuan annually, which is sufficient to repay the above-mentioned principal and interest of public bonds in one go.</p>
<p>The author believes that if these sources of funds can be realized as desired, the budget table for this year will be as follows:</p>
<p>Design Table of the National General Budget for 1948 (Unit: 100 Million Yuan)</p>
<p>Expenditure Section (Full Year)</p>
<p>Trillion 100 Million</p>
<p>Military Expenditure 150,0000</p>
<p>Economic Construction Expenditure 75,0000</p>
<p>Living Expenses for Public and Educational Personnel 30,0000</p>
<p>Debt Expenditure 15,0000</p>
<p>Other Government Affairs Expenditure 30,0000 Trillion 100 Million</p>
<p>Total Expenditure 300,0000 Trillion</p>
<p>Revenue Section (Full Year) Zi, Tax Revenue</p>
<p>1.  Unified Industrial and Commercial Tax Revenue 30,0000</p>
<p>2.  Property Tax Revenue (Relief) 30,0000</p>
<p>3.  Military Service Tax and Corvée Tax 30,0000</p>
<p>4.  Other Taxes 30,0000</p>
<p>Chou, State-Owned Property Revenue</p>
<p>1.  Proceeds from the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Industries 100,0000 Trillion</p>
<p>2.  Other State-Owned Property Revenue 10,0000 Trillion</p>
<p>Yin, Japanese Reparations Revenue 100,0000 Trillion</p>
<p>Mao, Surplus Revenue from State-Operated Enterprises 10,0000 100 Million Trillion</p>
<p>Total Revenue 330,0000</p>
<p>According to the author's rough estimate, the total amount of national budget expenditure for the full year this year is 300 trillion yuan, but the sources of funds are 330 trillion yuan. If another 100 trillion yuan of prize-winning public bonds are issued, there will still be a surplus of 130 trillion yuan this year. This estimate is not exaggerated. In a victorious country, there is no need for financial difficulties to arise! If the government can truly understand the people's psychology and the people can cooperate with the government, then this budget will inevitably be realized. We see that during wartime in Britain and the Soviet Union, when wartime public bonds were issued, the people rushed to buy them, often as if they were crazy, and they were sold out completely in a few days. This heroic act inspired by patriotism is indeed worthy of our people's lessons and emulation.</p>
<p>The author's proposed property tax of 30 trillion yuan is based on the Nanjing telegram of January 14 in the Shenbao, in which Finance Minister Yu Hongjun announced his talk on "increasing the special relief donation of 30 trillion yuan." The author believes that this number is not excessive. Based on the current market price standard, it is only worth 200 million yuan of legal tender before the war; based on the pre-war US dollar, it is only 66 million US dollars. It must be known that the object of suppressing the rebellion today is the greatest enemy of the domestic minority of wealthy classes. If they still do not generously contribute at this time, it is tantamount to digging their own graves. It is hoped that the Ministry of Finance can make the greatest determination and smoothly raise this special relief donation!</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the military service tax and corvée tax proposed by the author, the Ministry of Finance was ordered to draft measures during the War of Resistance. The author also participated in the design at that time and believed that in today's situation where our country's income tax system is not yet complete, it is necessary to implement this tax in order to help the finances overcome difficulties during wartime. This tax is similar to the Geng Fu system of the Han Dynasty in our country. Its main meaning is to contribute strength if you have strength and to contribute money if you have money, and to jointly assist the national defense. Today is an extraordinary period of suppressing the rebellion, and it is still necessary to propose this tax. The author believes that all male and female citizens of the Republic of China between the ages of 18 and 50 must pay military service tax and corvée tax to the national treasury every year. According to the author's rough estimate, the number of taxpayers nationwide, excluding bandit areas, is approximately 150 million people. If each person only needs to pay 11,000 yuan to the national treasury each month, there will be 20 trillion yuan annually. This burden can be borne by all the people of the country.</p>

<h3>China Aid United Association in England Discloses Future Plans</h3>

<h3>Yi Zhong, County Magistrate of Funing in Hebei, Accused of Embezzlement and Taken Into Custody</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Yi Zhong, the county magistrate of Funing in Hebei, was previously accused of embezzlement. It was alleged that he seized a sailboat on the coast of the Nandai River, containing over 8 billion legal tender, over 60,000 billion Red Army currency, and 17 catties of gold, all of which were allegedly pocketed by the county magistrate. Upon receiving the report, the Hebei Provincial Government immediately detained him.

<h3>Overall Battle Situation (Continued from page 1)</h3>
<p>4.  The East China Theater</p>
<p>Chen Yi's activities reached a fever pitch last winter. The East China Field Army once grew to 300,000 men. But after the disastrous defeat in the Yimeng Mountains, followed by defeats in the Lu-Yu and Jiaodong campaigns, his subordinates secretly lamented, "Counter-offensive, counter-offensive, we lost Shandong." At that time, his strength was reduced by more than half. In the past six months, he has been gathering remnants, resting and reorganizing for a short time in Hebei. Now, combining Lusi, Jiaodong, and Northern Jiangsu, although the number of people has recovered to nearly 200,000, they are all new recruits, and their strength is not as good as before. They can only dodge and avoid battles everywhere. He wants to restore the situation in Shandong last year and support Liu Bocheng in establishing the Central Plains battlefield, but he lacks the strength and will ultimately fail.</p>
<p>5.  The Central China Theater</p>
<p>Liu Bocheng failed in Western Shandong last September. With nowhere to go, he carried the banner of the vanguard of the general counter-offensive southward, implemented the "hollow tactics" and the "three-seeking tactics," and adventurously advanced into the Dabie Mountains, robbing and looting everywhere to seek soldiers and food. He also instructed Chen Geng in the Taihang Mountains to bring two more columns to enter Western Henan as a flanking force, declaring "We crossed the Yellow River last year, and we will cross the Yangtze River this year." His plan could not withstand the pursuit, encirclement, suppression, and sweeping operations of the National Army from all directions. He thought that the tactic of "eliminating the militia and dragging down the National Army" was very effective, but now he knows that it is not the National Army that is running around in exhaustion, but the bandit army. The tens of thousands of northern peasants he brought along, who were coerced into joining, were unable to adapt to the climate and fled one after another. Now he is in a very embarrassing situation. Although his and Chen Geng's forces total more than 120,000 in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, the Dabie Mountain base cannot be established, and Chen Yi's support and supply are limited. It can be said that the future of Liu and Chen's bandits is very bleak.</p>
<p>6.  The Fatal Wounds of the Communist Bandits</p>
<p>The total number of Communist bandits' soldiers in the country, including the Northeast, has exceeded one million, but he himself has three fatal wounds: First, these millions of farmers who were forced to join the armed forces were deceived and coerced. Given the opportunity, especially after fierce battles during long marches, they fled one after another or defected to the National Army. Second, in the past two years, 70% of the old cadres and veterans of the past Communist Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army have been eliminated in various battles. The majority of the new cadres and new recruits cannot endure the suffering of long-term and long-distance wandering, and their will and spirit to fight are very depressed. Third, the Communist bandits have recently accepted international orders to maintain the purity of their party and army in order to consolidate their internal affairs. Following the past rectification movement, they are carrying out a review movement and a widespread purge movement, investigating class, ideology, and bloodlines. As a result of internal division and struggle, most of the cadres are shaken. These points are the fatal wounds of the bandits and the main reasons why their power has expanded to the peak and cannot be further developed.</p>
<p>7.  Progress in the National Army's Suppression of Bandits</p>
<p>In the past, due to the National Government's policy of peace and political solutions, it was initially not prepared for the Communist bandits' total rebellion. It can also be said that it was not prepared to suppress the bandits, so in the past two years, the National Army did not fully understand the Communist bandits' conspiracies, tricks, and tactics on the battlefield, and suffered some losses. However, due to the bloody lessons and experiences of the past two years, and more importantly, the relationship between the survival of the nation, the people, and the country itself, the psychology of common hatred for the enemy is becoming stronger day by day. People in various places have also spontaneously armed themselves to assist the National Army in combat, and the tactics of suppressing bandits are improving day by day. It is not easy for the Communist bandits to take advantage of loopholes again. In addition, the newly trained fresh troops of the National Army still exceed the Communist bandits three to five times in quantity and quality. As long as political coordination with the military and support from the rear for the front line are strengthened, the National Army's achievements in suppressing bandits this year can be guaranteed to be better than last year, and at the same time, it is not difficult to foresee that the Communist bandits' failure this year will be even more miserable than last year.</p>
<p>The old system of replacing tax labor originated from the household tax of the Qin Dynasty and was followed by successive dynasties until the Qing Dynasty. Its names include head tax, household levy, head money, poll tax, head tax money, head levy, head silver, head calculation, and calculation levy. Although the names are different, the nature is the same. In the early Han Dynasty, people aged five to fifty-six paid a tax of 120 coins per person per year, which was called a calculation. This is the so-called head tax. The Han Dynasty's replacement tax labor system had three categories: regular military service, base civil service, and purchase labor. In ancient times, there were no permanent soldiers, and everyone took turns, one month at a time, which was regular military service. Those who were poor and wanted to obtain replacement money could pay the next person in line to replace them, 2,000 coins per month, which was base civil service. Everyone in the world had to garrison the border for three days, which was also called replacement labor, or "stationing." Those who did not go had to pay 300 coins to the government, which the government used to pay those who were stationed. This was called purchase labor. From this, it can be seen that this was the ancient national defense financial policy of our country. We are not advocating restoring the past, but collecting a small amount of tax similar to the replacement tax labor may not be a fair financial policy during this extraordinary period. Since the armed comrades on the front lines are defending the country with their lives in the icy and snowy weather, the people in the rear should at least provide them with material and spiritual assistance. In this way, the loyalty of all the people and armed comrades to the country can be balanced. Today, I hear that some people in the rear of the war line often complain about the government and criticize the government because of economic difficulties, and even slander the government. This is like the lament of a part of the traitors during the Anti-Japanese War that the government should not fight against Japan. They believed that the National Government's move from Nanjing to Hankou to Chongqing meant that China would be ruled by Japan, so they flocked to beg for mercy from Japanese imperialism, willing to be its lackeys and puppets. These Chinese dregs and national traitors, who had no patriotism or revolutionary spirit, did not understand the ultimate effect of the National Government's leadership of the long-term resistance war and the exertion of revolutionary forces until after their death or imprisonment. Although their despicable actions did not damage the overall life of the country, it should be known that their despicable actions actually increased the burden on the National Government's war effort. This is because their existence caused a lot of trouble on our country's ideological and economic war lines. Today, the campaign to suppress bandits and quell the chaos is related to the survival of the nation and the country, just like the Anti-Japanese War, so it is not allowed for some people not to do their best for the country and contribute their money.</p>
<p>Finally, the author concludes as follows: The national budget for this year has already begun. Now, the National Government must concentrate its efforts to make it a financial effort to complete the quelling of the chaos and building the country. In other words, the five major systems of the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Examination Yuan under the National Government must work together to try their best to increase financial resources on the one hand, and try their best to control waste on the other. For example, to solve the problem of enemy and puppet property in state-owned property, the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan must closely cooperate to complete their goal of increasing the treasury's income from the sale of enemy and puppet property by at least 100 trillion yuan in this year in the fastest and most effective way. For example, in order to thoroughly solve the problem of the heads of the treasury system of government agencies at all levels and the personnel who directly manage cash, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Examination Yuan must cooperate with each other. On the one hand, they must strive to improve the quality of personnel in the personnel system, and on the other hand, they must step up the prevention of the occurrence of fraudulent phenomena. In particular, the ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan must cooperate closely and give full play to the spirit of division of labor and cooperation. For example, if a replacement tax labor is collected, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior must cooperate to achieve perfect results. Although constitutional government is about to begin, during this extraordinary period, we must not focus our attention on constitutional issues and put the most urgent work of war chaos in a slow picture.</p>
<p>At the same time, the financial authorities must deeply understand the close relationship between finance and currency. In order to keep the budget and final accounts from having huge discrepancies, we must first stabilize market prices. In order to stabilize market prices, we must first absorb the floating capital roaming in the market. In order to absorb the floating capital in the market, we must first give full play to the original functions of the bank. Therefore, in addition to the Ministry of Finance directly issuing lottery bonds and entrusting the Central Trust Bureau to issue traitorous savings prize coupons, we must order the seven major national financial institutions to concentrate their efforts and use all appropriate methods to absorb fixed deposits and savings deposits, and use the preferential interest rate of the time before currency reform to accelerate the absorption of deposits, thereby controlling the purchasing power of the people.</p>
<p>In addition, improving the treatment of civil and military officials and armed comrades is the basis for solidifying the revolutionary forces of the National Government. In this way, administrative efficiency and fighting spirit can be brought into play. The financial authorities must pay special attention to this point.</p>
<p>In short, man proposes and God disposes. There is no reason to be pessimistic about this year's budget, and all pessimistic phenomena are created by mediocre people. However, since it is a phenomenon made by people, it can be overcome by human forces.</p>

<h3>Early Implementation of the Marshall Plan: The United States Urges Cooperation in Western Europe. Meeting of Sixteen European Nations to Reconvene</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 13th (Broadcast): Washington dispatch: A State Department spokesman stated that the United States has agreed to participate in another meeting of the sixteen nations in the European Recovery Program to discuss the needs of recovery. The time will be roughly at the end of this month, and the location may still be Paris.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Responsible parties have confirmed the news from the United States that a meeting of sixteen nations will be convened in March, but the date has not yet been determined. Britain and France will be the inviting countries and will consult with the other fourteen nations on the European Recovery Program. However, the report of the sixteen nations, which is the basis for estimating the cost of European reconstruction, will not be discussed at this meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The British and French governments are currently inquiring with the other fourteen European nations whether it is appropriate to reopen the meeting of sixteen nations to discuss the Marshall Plan. A few days ago, the British and French ambassadors to the United States discussed this matter with the State Department. As a result, the three parties agreed in principle that there is a need to hold another meeting of sixteen nations. The matters to be considered by the new meeting are two: (1) establishing a permanent sixteen-nation organization; (2) studying the continued development of economic cooperation among European countries. The conditions for American aid to Europe will not be included in the agenda.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The State Department no longer opposes the early reopening of the meeting of sixteen European nations on the Marshall Plan, but stated that the reopening date has not yet been determined. The change in the U.S. attitude has been notified by Deputy Secretary of State Lovett to British Minister Balfour and has been conveyed to France. U.S. officials still hope that after the meeting is reopened, they can avoid points of contention and focus on European economic cooperation, the establishment of a permanent organization for the meeting, and review the achievements that have been completed since the end of the Paris meeting last summer, which are the tasks to be done in the future. The United States deeply wants to avoid public expressions of fear of the conditions attached by the United States by other parties. This expression will show a lack of unity in Europe, thus increasing the difficulties in Congress. Another reason for the change in the State Department's attitude is the smooth progress of the European Recovery Program in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A portion of the bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which was announced yesterday, not only urges European countries to engage in cooperation and quickly establish a permanent economic cooperation organization, but also does not attach any conditions other than those voluntarily accepted by one European country. It can be seen that the Foreign Relations Committee and other agencies of Congress are willing for the European side to start working under the European Recovery Program immediately.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Boston, 12th] New York Governor Dewey, who may be a Republican presidential candidate, delivered a speech here tonight, advocating that the sixteen Western European countries receiving U.S. aid should conclude a military alliance.</p>
<h3>European Countries Accepting U.S. Aid Must Comply with Six Conditions: Resolution by U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolved today that countries accepting assistance under the Marshall Plan must comply with certain conditions if they wish to continue receiving U.S. aid. The proposed bill passed by the committee authorizes the President to terminate assistance to countries that fail to fulfill their promises of self-help and economic cooperation, or when the assistance provided by the United States conflicts with U.S. national interests. The committee also stipulates that countries receiving assistance must agree to (1) increase the production of coal, iron, steel, and food; (2) improve their transportation systems; (3) stabilize their currencies; (4) guarantee full access to information regarding the use of U.S. aid; (5) list accounts in local currencies equal to the amount of U.S. aid; and (6) exchange the sale of materials as a standard to transfer strategic materials to the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg declared today that the committee has unanimously agreed that European countries must do their best to help themselves and each other if they want to obtain U.S. aid. The committee is making the Marshall Plan into a bill to be submitted to the Senate for a vote, believing that the sixteen European countries that want to obtain U.S. aid must implement guarantees and formulate a common recovery plan based on self-help and mutual cooperation. Each country must sign an agreement with the United States to seek its own recovery and keep its promises without change.</p>
<p>If any country fails to do its best or does not use U.S. aid for the intended purpose, U.S. executives will be ordered to stop the aid. If the situation changes or there is no need to continue, the executive can also stop providing assistance. This last clause can be invoked when a country is controlled by the Communist Party, stopping U.S. assistance. Although the bill strictly stipulates that U.S. aid cannot be used for other purposes, it does not exclude European countries' colonies. According to what Vandenberg told reporters, the United States hopes to obtain strategic raw materials from the colonies to repay part of the dollars and supplies it allocated, so it pays special attention to the colonies of European countries.</p>
<h3>Spaak Speaks Freely on Belgium's Foreign Policy: Supports Bevin's Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 12th] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak spoke freely to the Foreign Relations Committee of the Parliament about Belgium's position in the international arena. According to the official statement, after Spaak explained the reasons for Belgium's support of the principles declared by Foreign Minister Bevin, he outlined the principles necessary to obtain the support of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, including the need to solve the problem of West Germany in cooperation with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Spaak firmly expressed his hope that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg could participate on an equal footing in the meeting on the German problem to be held by Britain, the United States, and France in London. Spaak continued, the agreement formed by the Soviet Union and its neighboring satellite countries can only promote the formation of a Western group similar to it. When there is already an organization in Eastern Europe, the West must not be without an organization. The cooperation between Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is by no means the beginning of an aggressive policy. This agreement only has mutual aid significance. This mutual aid will be a comprehensive cooperation including economic, political, and military affairs. Stalin once expressed his support for this agreement. Spaak said, although the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have a common policy, each country will still maintain its individual rights within the framework of this common policy. Finally, Spaak said that the Dunkirk Treaty between Britain and France has already been expanded, and it is indeed necessary to establish a broader agreement. The Belgian Parliament's Foreign Relations Committee then passed support for Spaak's remarks, only the Communist Party members did not express their opinions.</p>
<h3>Sino-American High School to University: Presents New Plan</h3>

<h3>South Korean Communist Party Agitates for General Strike</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 13th] The Central Committee of the South Korean Communist Party today implemented a general strike, its call to action containing the phrase "Strike until final victory." The main purpose of this strike is to protest the actions of the United Nations Commission and the division of Korea. According to the first call for a general strike, issued on February 7th to "all Korean patriotic patriots," workers are simply asked to lay down their tools. The new call emphasizes opposition to "the holy war-like peaceful nature of foreign imperialism" and demands the withdrawal of the United Nations Commission and foreign occupation forces. It concludes, "We oppose the separate election in South Korea. The time for empty talk is past. Today we must act." At the same time, sporadic riots and strikes have taken place in various provinces. In the area of Pu Lu (transliteration), there was a clash between farmers and police, with fourteen farmers injured.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Already Possesses Giant Aircraft</h3>
<p>More Effective Than Superfortresses</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Republican Congressman Merlo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the Soviet Union has a large number of giant bombers that are more effective than American Superfortresses. He believes that air superiority is the only language that some nations can understand. If I had to choose between air superiority and the European Recovery Program, I would choose the former.</p>
<h3>Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany Announces Establishment of Economic Commission to Compete with British and American Zones</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Soviet Military Government Chief Sokolovsky today ordered the establishment of an economic commission for the Soviet zone in Germany, with a permanent chairman and representatives from the zone government's labor, agriculture, and other departments serving as members. This institution is the counterpart to the economic commission in the British and American merged zone in Frankfurt, and its establishment was not unexpected by people here. Since the announcement of the charter for the British and American merged zone on February 6th, Soviet-controlled newspapers have repeatedly foreshadowed this.</p>
<h3>Streamlining Administration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 12th] It is reported that the Soviet occupation authorities have established a committee to review personnel and organizational matters of various German central institutions in the Soviet zone. According to the committee chairman, Steiner, the committee's work must be completed by March 15th, and the results may lead to changes in the German central administrative institutions in the Soviet zone. Steiner also stated that this move is aimed at simplifying administration and is not intended to establish a central government similar to the one in the British and American merged zone.</p>
<h3>US Policy Toward Germany: The Ruhr and Rhineland</h3>
<p>Advocates Continued Control by Occupation Authorities</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The House Foreign Aid Selection Committee released a report today, stating that Germany's neighboring countries have good reason to fear the resurgence of German industrial capacity. It also believes that a democratic Germany based on a free economic system is the best guarantee of peace in Europe. The report also believes that France's proposal to politically separate the Ruhr and Rhineland from Germany and place them under international supervision is difficult to implement. There are also significant doubts about the British Trades Union Congress's suggestion to nationalize Ruhr coal mines and factories to prevent future military or economic aggression. The compromise is to keep the Ruhr and Rhineland as part of Germany politically and economically, and to establish new companies to operate and hold the basic factories and mines in the Ruhr area. German public and private capital as well as foreign capital will have the opportunity to participate in these new companies. The operation policy and finances of the Ruhr mines should be supervised by a committee composed of the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan, plus the United States and the future German government. However, the three occupying powers of Britain, the United States, and Germany should have greater voting rights in the international committee. During the transitional period, the Ruhr and Rhineland should continue to be under the control of the British and American merged zone authorities.</p>
<h3>New US Chief of Staff Plans to Inspect the Far East</h3>

<h3>No Progress in Japanese Politics: Three Parties Oppose Shigeru Yoshida's Appointment as New Prime Minister; Tetsu Katayama May Form a Cabinet Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 13th] The secretaries-general of Japan's four major political parties held a meeting yesterday to select a new prime minister. Negotiations stalled due to the Liberal Party's insistence that its leader, Shigeru Yoshida, be appointed prime minister, which was opposed by the other three parties. Although the meeting continued today, the hope of an agreement is slim. Shigeru Yoshida continues to oppose the formation of a coalition cabinet, and newspapers predict that the Liberal Party will take independent action and become an opposition party if it fails to form a cabinet. Former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama told the press that he supports the formation of a coalition cabinet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Judging from the current situation, the establishment of the second Katayama cabinet is highly likely, because the leaders of the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party cannot work together and have failed to obtain support from other parties to form a coalition cabinet that can control the majority in the parliament. Therefore, the only trend is for Tetsu Katayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, to form a cabinet again. The left and right wings of the Socialist Party have now realized the necessity of restoring party unity. Suzuki Mosaburo, the leader of the party's left wing, stated this afternoon that he is willing to resign from his position on the House Budget Committee. The committee rejected the government's proposed supplementary budget, which led to the collapse of the cabinet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Prime Minister Katayama, before leaving for his villa in Katase, Kanagawa Prefecture, for recuperation on the 12th, told reporters, "Judging from the current political situation in Japan, I am afraid that a central coalition cabinet will have to be formed. Even if it is unstable, there is no other way. Because I had no confidence in managing the political situation, I resigned. Therefore, who will be the next prime minister is unknown, and everything should be freely decided by the parliament."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] Outgoing Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama left Tokyo for his seaside private residence near Yokohama on the 13th for recuperation. However, observers say that if the stalemate continues, the possibility of Katayama forming a cabinet again will greatly increase.</p>
<h3>Five Eastern European Countries Study Plan to Develop Resources in Danube Basin, Revitalize Agriculture and Industry, and Eliminate Tax Barriers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Prague, 12th, United Press] According to well-informed diplomatic sources, five Eastern European Soviet satellite states are studying a plan to develop the fertile Danube River Basin. Hungary and Yugoslavia are the leaders of this plan, and Romania and Bulgaria are fully cooperating. The Hungarian ambassador to France, Karolyi, has come here to consult with the Czech authorities on this matter. This plan includes: (1) Establishing a small Tennessee Valley Authority power plant to generate electricity using the Danube River and its tributaries. (2) Dredging and utilizing inland waterways for transportation to reduce transportation costs and control floods. (3) Increasing the volume of trade in agricultural and mineral products. (4) Expanding industrial facilities. This plan may also discuss the elimination of tariff barriers and will be coordinated with the five countries' long-term economic plans and the bilateral trade agreements signed between the five countries. The above-mentioned agreements may lead to a comprehensive multilateral agreement among the five countries.</p>
<h3>Lost in Snowstorm: Turkish Plane Shot Down by Bulgaria</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 12th] Turkish aviation experts say that the two Spitfire aircraft shot down by Bulgaria on the Bulgarian-Turkish border were lost in a snowstorm. The two aircraft came from Atria-Hopal. Due to the bad weather and poor visibility, they could not be controlled near the Bulgarian border and therefore got lost. The fact that the two aircraft circled over Ansu-Bupir proves that they were looking for a way back. According to Bulgarian statements, the weather was very good when the Turkish aircraft flew into Bulgarian territory.</p>
<h3>Britain and Argentina Sign New Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Buenos Aires, 13th] Britain and Argentina negotiated a new trade agreement for eleven weeks and formally signed it last night.

In addition, it should sell steel, tinplate, asbestos, medicines, whiskey, wool, textiles, and automobiles to Argentina. Argentina, on the other hand, will obtain 12,000 miles of railway, which is Britain's largest investment in South America. The total price is 600 million US dollars in cash. Argentina also guarantees to ship 1 million tons of coal and 16,179 barrels of kerosene.</p>

<h3>Change of British Ambassador to the United States: Sir Franks to Succeed; Enthusiastic Welcome from US Government and Public</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Sir Franks has been appointed as the British Ambassador to the United States, succeeding Lord Inverchapel (formerly Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who has served as ambassador to China and the Soviet Union), who has resigned from diplomatic service. Franks was a professor of philosophy at the University of Glasgow. At the outbreak of the war, he joined the Ministry of Supply and was later promoted to Deputy Secretary. When sixteen European countries held a meeting in Paris to discuss the Marshall Plan, Franks served as the chief British representative and was elected chairman of the European Economic Cooperation Committee. He then led the British delegation to Washington to participate in the European Recovery negotiations. Sir Franks is 42 years old and is currently the Principal of Queen's College, Oxford.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The US government and public have expressed a warm welcome to Franks's appointment as British Ambassador to the United States. Franks's appointment to this position indicates Britain's emphasis on the Marshall Plan and Britain's sincere support for the interests and principles of the European Recovery Plan. Foreign Secretary Bevin originally wanted an ambassador who could continue to serve in Washington throughout the implementation of the Marshall Plan.</p>

<p>Stabbing a Man in the Back When He Is in Danger</p>
<p>No effort made by one government to prevent another from entering the war has been more sincere than our efforts to prevent Italy from entering the war. For five months before Mussolini joined the war, we appealed to him and exerted pressure.</p>
<p>On April 20th, Taylor sent me two telegrams to forward to the President. In one telegram, he said that there was a real danger of Mussolini joining Hitler's side or launching aggression alone in new areas. He quoted the words of the Vatican's Foreign Minister Maglione, urging the President to take action within two or three days, preferably immediately. In another telegram, Taylor quoted the Pope's words, urging the President to send a telegram to Mussolini immediately. The Pope said that at that time he would take parallel action and cooperate.</p>
<p>After receiving these two telegrams, I notified the President, who was at the Warm Springs in Georgia at the time. He felt that after expressing himself to Mussolini twice (once through our ambassador and once through Welles), he had said enough. Checking the telegrams sent to the President from many capitals, we believed that Mussolini's actions would be launched in a few days.</p>
<p>But on April 26th, Taylor telegraphed again, saying that he had met again with the Pope and Foreign Minister Maglione, who reiterated their previous suggestions. Taylor reported the Vatican's belief that Mussolini was likely to take sudden action, especially because he had to act quickly to overcome the forces at home that opposed entering the war, as rumored outside.</p>
<p>On Sunday, April 28th, the President returned to Washington. I read Taylor's telegrams with him and told him that the British and French governments were also worried that Mussolini would enter the war by force. So the President decided that he should send an appeal to Mussolini, this time in written form.</p>
<p>The drafting of the message was completed that afternoon (April 29th), and telegraphed to Mussolini that night.</p>
<p>The next day, Taylor telegraphed to the President that the Pope, true to his previous suggestion of parallel action, had sent a handwritten message directly to Mussolini.</p>
<p>Mussolini met with Phillips on May 1st and praised the President's message to him. He said that Germany could not be defeated and that European peace could not be considered without recognizing the new geographical situation created by Hitler's conquests. As for Italy, he said that its "imprisonment in the Mediterranean" could not be tolerated and denounced Britain's possession of the Suez Canal and Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Mussolini's verbal remarks to Phillips were actually much milder than Mussolini's written reply to the President, which was sent to the White House by Ambassador Colonna on May 2nd.</p>
<p>Several days later, Phillips telegraphed me that he had seen Foreign Minister Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, who told him that Britain's decision to withdraw its merchant fleet from the Mediterranean was an unexpected move for Rome, because Italy had no intention of entering the war unless the Allies attacked Italy.</p>
<p>After the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg began, Phillips telegraphed me again on May 10th, saying that he had seen Ciano again, who had just seen Mussolini. Ciano said that Italy had not decided or considered changing its course because of the new German actions.</p>
<p>But just four days later, the situation had completely changed. Phillips telegraphed me a statement Ciano made to him, saying that a week ago, he still thought the possibility of Italy not entering the war was fifty-fifty, but now the odds in favor of entering the war were ninety-ten. Ciano said that Mussolini had already decided to advocate for it.</p>
<p>After London and Paris received this news, panic reached a climax. Ambassador Bullitt sent me a frantic request, arguing that the President should put more pressure on Mussolini. Prime Minister Reynaud asked us to sell several outdated destroyers to Britain and France, because he expected Italian submarines to start attacking in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>When Phillips's telegram arrived at the State Department, I sent it to the President. He immediately decided to make another appeal to Mussolini. So we drafted it again with him at the State Department, and I telegraphed it to Ambassador Phillips that night (May 14th).</p>
<p>The President said, "I have told Your Excellency before that I am a realist. I know that you, as a realist, will certainly admit that if this war expands to the whole world, it will exceed the control of the heads of state of all countries, causing the destruction of millions of lives and the crystallization of human freedom and civilization. And no one, no matter how omniscient and omnipotent, can predict the consequences for himself and his own people."</p>
<p>Phillips wanted to see Mussolini again, but this time Mussolini said that he hoped to receive the President's second message through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Three days later, on May 18th, Phillips telegraphed me Mussolini's reply to the President, in which he said that "Italy intends to maintain an alliance with Germany. At a time when the fate of Europe is being gambled, Italy cannot stand idly by."</p>
<p>At the same time, in the days before the reply arrived, Bullitt in Paris tried to maintain the closest contact with the French government, reflecting a natural panic about the ominous turn of the war. He sent many telegrams suggesting what actions our country should take against Italy. He suggested that the President should ask the church to threaten Mussolini, explaining that if Italy entered the war, the Vatican would break off contact with Italy, and ask the Pope to condemn Hitler's aggression from a spiritual standpoint, approaching the issuance of an order to break off contact. He also suggested that our Atlantic Fleet should be sent to Greece for a ceremonial visit, that remittances from Italian immigrants should be cut off if Italy entered the war, and that Italian immigrants and Italian Americans should pass a resolution opposing Italy's participation in the war.</p>
<p>I discussed these suggestions with the President. We were willing to take any steps that might have a reasonable chance of success. But it was already clear that Mussolini had made up his mind.</p>
<p>Then, on May 25th, Churchill and Reynaud invited the President to make another representation to Mussolini. They suggested that the President should make a statement to him based on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The President has reason to believe that Britain and France are aware that Italy has some dissatisfaction with them on territorial issues.</p>
<p>(2) At present, Britain and France are fully prepared to consider Italy's demands in order to reach an agreement to satisfy Italy's reasonable demands after the war.</p>
<p>(3) The Allies will allow Italy to participate in the peace conference, with a status equal to any belligerent country.</p>
<p>Churchill and Reynaud suggested that the President should add that if Italy avoided entering the war to make things difficult for Britain and France, the United States would do its best to ensure that any agreement reached was fulfilled.</p>
<p>These suggestions must be made by the President on his own behalf, not as an agent of the Allies.</p>
<p>The President soon agreed to this approach without much difficulty. But he did say that rather than acting according to the wishes of Britain and France, he would prefer to continue his method of corresponding with Mussolini on this issue, which is to say that everything was done on his own initiative, not at the request of Britain and France.</p>
<p>The President's message was drafted in the State Department, and I telegraphed it to Ambassador Phillips on May 26th.</p>
<p>Now, there was a definite proposal before Mussolini. According to this proposal, he could get any reasonable demands without resorting to war, and with the United States guaranteeing that Britain and France would abide by the agreement.</p>
<p>But the next day, Phillips telegraphed me Mussolini's "no." Ciano told him that Mussolini's intention was not only to realize Italy's legitimate aspirations, but also to fulfill his alliance responsibilities to Germany.</p>
<p>Although Mussolini's replies were more hostile each time, the President did not give up because of this and wanted to make another attempt to the Italian dictator. We immediately drafted it and telegraphed it to Phillips on May 30th. This time, the President said that "the result of the war expanding again due to Italy's participation in the war will immediately cause the United States itself to step up its rearmament plan and make the United States government redouble its efforts to provide the Allies with every convenience in obtaining all necessary supplies and materials within the United States." The President reminded Mussolini that we have historical interests in the Mediterranean that have been maintained for nearly 150 years.</p>
<p>Mussolini's reply was even more definite and hostile than before. On May 31st, Phillips telegraphed President and me Ciano's statement, in which he said that Mussolini had decided to enter the war, and now it was only a matter of time—a matter of days. When Phillips explained that if Italy entered the war, the attitude of the American public towards Italy would change significantly, Ciano replied that this had already been considered. The next day, Phillips telegraphed me Mussolini's own statement, in which he said that he was willing to fulfill his responsibilities to Germany and was unwilling to "be subjected to any further pressure," because such pressure was "sufficient to make his attitude even tougher." He said that he did not believe that Italy's intervention would necessarily expand the war in the Mediterranean, and questioned our demands for interests in the Mediterranean region, claiming that these demands were equivalent to Italy's demands in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>At this point, France directly expressed to Mussolini its willingness to resolve Italy's territorial demands. But on June 3rd, Bullitt telegraphed me that Ciano replied to the French ambassador to Italy, claiming that Mussolini was not interested in accepting any French territory through peaceful negotiations. He had decided to wage war on France and did not intend to reply to France's message.</p>
<p>The President and Welles still wanted to use France's intentions as a springboard to make another appeal to Mussolini. A draft message had been prepared in the State Department. But by that time, I felt that there had been too many appeals to a thug who was determined to satisfy his own vanity with war. I very firmly opposed issuing this message. My opposition had an effect, and the message prepared on June 7th was not issued.</p>
<p>When Mussolini declared war on Britain and France on June 10th, none of us were surprised. That night, the President delivered a speech at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. He stated the many efforts he had made to prevent Italy from entering the war. Then he said:</p>
<p>"On this day, June 10, 1940, the hand that held the dagger has stabbed it into the back of its neighbor."</p>
<p>This phrase was in the draft that we drafted in the State Department. Welles suggested to the President that he remove it, because saying so would make Mussolini feel so resentful towards him that it would be impossible to obtain his cooperation when the time for peace talks came. In fact, the idea of stabbing in the back had already been used by Prime Minister Reynaud as early as May 20th, and it was mentioned several times in Bullitt's telegrams. The President removed the phrase from his speech, but changed his mind on the way to Charlottesville and reinserted it.</p>
<h3>Britain to Implement Price Controls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Britain's price control plan will be enacted by the end of this month. The list of items subject to price controls will not be announced until then to prevent speculation. The price control measures will be based on the prices in December and January and will have retroactive effect to prevent the effect of stimulating prices before the freeze. It is generally expected that non-essential clothing, porcelain, household linen, glassware, stationery, electric lights, radios, etc. will be on the list of items with price limits.</p>
<h3>Britain, United States, and France to Publish All German Secret Documents: Soviet Propaganda Not Worth Refuting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain, the United States, and France will jointly disclose German secret documents soon, and documents on British-German relations before World War II will also be included. The publishers are the full content of the documents, unlike those recently published by Moscow, which are limited to the conversations between the then British Foreign Secretary Halifax and the British Ambassador Henderson. The documents jointly published by Britain, the United States, and France total three volumes.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] A Foreign Office spokesman today denied Soviet accusations that Britain had anti-Soviet intentions with Hitler in 1938, saying that this was completely unfounded and not worth refuting. The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night that it had discovered in captured German archives that pre-war British and French policy was aimed at encouraging Hitler to invade the Soviet Union. Britain and France tacitly allowed Germany to occupy Czechoslovakia and Austria, and Britain and France had a non-aggression understanding with Hitler.</p>
<h3>American Commodity Prices Plummet; Both Parties Shirk Responsibility</h3>
<p>Villagers Still Hope for Price Controls</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] American commodity prices have fallen sharply in the past eight days. After studying recent market trends, American businessmen have discovered that stock values have fallen by 3 billion US dollars. The severe drop in general commodities is unprecedented in American history. At a time when politicians, financial leaders, and newspapers are assuring the public that this phenomenon is not alarming, the government and the Republican Party are shifting responsibility for the decline in commodity prices, which is truly intriguing. There are now widespread fears of a potentially serious economic downturn.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman stated at a press conference today that although commodity prices have fallen, inflation remains a major crisis. Congress must proceed with enacting the bill he proposed on November 17th of last year to effectively control wages and prices.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 12th] Senator Taft stated that he believes the current price declines will eventually rise and will not cause a collapse or unemployment because there is strong demand for goods and strong purchasing power. Taft also believes that the price declines will not hinder overall employment, unless the declines become more widespread. He believes that some price declines are a good thing because this will help tighten the rising curve of private inflation, which also should not affect the Republican Party's tax reduction plan.</p>
<h3>Ceylon Celebrates Independence; Flag Raising Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ceylon Capital, 12th] Ceylon today held a flag-raising ceremony at the famous Octagonal Temple of the Tooth, where Prime Minister Senanayake hoisted the Lion Flag, symbolizing Ceylon's restoration of independence after 133 years of British rule. Approximately 150,000 people attended the ceremony, including the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. After the ceremony, a grand parade began, led by 100 richly decorated elephants, followed by dancers, drummers, whip wielders, and torchbearers in the thousands. Fireworks were then set off on a small island in the lake next to the temple.</p>
<h3>Lincoln's Birthday Commemoration</h3>
<p>Republican Party Political Propaganda Campaign</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] Today is the 139th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. The American people are celebrating by enthusiastically promoting Lincoln's humanitarianism and his ideal of racial equality. Lincoln is revered as the guardian of the Republican Party. Today, his birthday is being used by Republicans as a gathering date to strive for a presidential election victory that they have been seeking for fifteen years.</p>
<h3>After the International Tribunal Concludes the Trial of Tojo; US Prosecution Team to Disband; Solid Evidence of Japan's Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] It was learned tonight that the US military has abandoned plans to continue trying more than twenty Japanese war criminals. After the trial of the first group of war criminals, including Tojo, is concluded, the international tribunal's prosecution team and defense attorneys will be disbanded. This decision by Washington was based on the recommendation of Chief Prosecutor Keenan. The second group of war criminals currently in detention will be investigated by the Judge Advocate Section of MacArthur's headquarters. If war crimes are confirmed, they will be tried by the Yokohama War Crimes Tribunal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] During today's session of the Far East International Military Tribunal, US Assistant Prosecutor Sutton read a portion of the general indictment, accusing the twenty-five Class A war crime suspects of deliberately fabricating the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The portion read by Sutton was the indictment of Japan's aggression against China from 1937 to 1945. It accused the Japanese side of purchasing 6,000 mu of land between Fengtai and the Marco Polo Bridge, but failing to complete the purchase. The Japanese then sought a pretext to seize the Marco Polo Bridge with their troops, and then to control Beiping. Regarding the Japanese launching of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which developed into an eight-year war of aggression against China, the witnesses stated the following: (1) The Japanese military strength in the Marco Polo Bridge area far exceeded the needs for guarding, with Chinese sources estimating 15,000 men. The Japanese side claimed only 7,000 men. (2) The Japanese military exercise on the night of July 7th had "deliberate provocative intentions". (3) The weapons used by the Japanese army during the exercise that night were loaded with live ammunition, not blanks. (4) The Japanese army did not notify the Chinese authorities before conducting the exercise. (5) The exercise was not conducted at a fixed location, but in the area near the railway bridge. (6) Only one defense witness (who was not at the scene when the incident occurred) supported the Japanese version, namely that the Chinese troops fired first from Wanping. (7) No Japanese soldiers went missing after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, as the defendants did not mention this point, and the Japanese military used the missing soldier incident as a pretext for making demands. Although a joint committee was established to investigate the cause of the incident, the Japanese military surrounded Wanping from three sides. Five witnesses testified that the Japanese fired first. The general indictment stated: "The evidence of the Japanese launching the war is clear." The indictment also stated that the Marco Polo Bridge Incident "is extremely similar to the Mukden Incident, but avoids the previous loopholes." After the two sides agreed on July 9th to cease military action through negotiations, the Japanese military reinforced its forces to 20,000 men and 100 aircraft. The war then restarted on July 14th. At the same time, the Japanese General Staff decided to greatly increase the troop strength in the area. The Japanese government insisted on the pretext of "local resolution" in an attempt to make North China autonomous in all aspects. The general indictment listed a large amount of testimony to confirm the Japanese intentions.</p>
<h3>US to Conduct Air Combat Exercises on the Far Eastern Border; Ten Flying Fortresses Arrive in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] Ten US Air Force B-29 aircraft arrived here from the United States on the 13th and will conduct "30-Day Intensive Air Combat Exercises" along the US air frontier in the Far East. The Soviet Union has repeatedly complained that American aircraft often cross the border into Soviet-controlled areas. The US Army announced that the exercises will be conducted under "simulated combat" conditions. It also stated that this is part of the US peacetime policy, "The US peacetime policy is to station major strategic forces in internal areas, which can be deployed to any part of the world in case of emergency."</p>
<h3>Security Council Postpones Debate on Indo-Pakistani Dispute; Indian Representative Returns Home to Receive New Instructions</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Security Council reached a compromise with India on the 13th to continue debating the Indo-Pakistani dispute while allowing the Indian representative to return home to receive new instructions. The Security Council has decided to suspend the debate for six days without opposition. The next Security Council meeting will discuss new dispute issues, not just the Kashmir issue. This compromise was proposed by Security Council Chairman Carter and Representative McNaughton.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 13th] The chairman of the Indian delegation to the Security Council, Ayyangar, along with five members of the delegation, left here by plane today, taking the route through Paris and Cairo back to Mumbai.</p>

<p>Regarding the wage issue after the resumption of jewelry sales by gold shops, the employer's demand for 100% was considered unreasonable by Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. It is reported that the wage is intended to be flexible and may be calculated proportionally according to the cost of living index in the future.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply Improves; 70,000 Tons at Qinhuangdao; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of the Month</h3>

Ren Xianqun, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Food Distribution Committee, and Ji Mingqi, Section Chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, summoned representatives of rice merchants to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to discuss issues such as market prices and government sales of rice. According to Ren Xianqun, the rumor that the retail price of white rice during the Spring Festival had exceeded 2 million yuan is untrue. The government, fearing price fluctuations in the red-letter market, has stored a large amount of rice, ready to sell it on the market at any time. The rice merchants, fearing that the sale of rice would affect their sales and the commissions of intermediaries, requested that the government not sell rice on the market before rice prices fluctuate. The Food Distribution Committee has now prepared 100,000 dan of rice, with 50,000 dan allocated to each of the North and South markets. If the market fluctuates, it will be sold at any time and a flexible strategy will be adopted. The selling price and market trading price will be based on the market's final closing price at the end of last year. At that time, the production area Wuxi Superior White Japonica was 1.6 million, Songjiang Japonica was 1.42 million, and Suzhou White Rice was 1.4 million. The Shanghai trading price in the North Market was 1.868 million for Superior Japonica. Therefore, today's red-letter price will be maintained between 1.68 million and 1.8 million. If there are fluctuations, the authorities will sell the prepared rice on the market.</p>
<h3>Forty of Our Military Police to Depart for Japan by Ship on the 20th</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Forty of our military police officers, who are to take on the task of guarding the mission to Japan, have been decided to depart to Japan on the China Merchants Bureau Hai Kang ship, which is scheduled to depart on the 20th of this month. The news of the military police unit going to Japan has been circulating for a long time, because the foreign exchange funds had to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, so it has been delayed until now. It is reported that MacArthur's headquarters stated: Although this is the first time in history that our country has sent troops to Japan, it is not an occupation, but only to perform the task of guarding the mission, so it is hoped that our country will not publicize it too much to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Banditry in the Wusong Anchorage Steals Firewood Boats</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] In the anchorage outside of Wusong, bands of bandits have been active recently, and ships entering and leaving the port are often robbed. The afternoon before yesterday, two bandit boats were discovered near the Bailonggang Chicken Buoy. They even pretended to be water police patrol boats and intercepted the Jin Shunli firewood boat that was coming from Dinghai to Songjiang. At the time, there were eight or nine bandits armed with weapons who searched the boat. Because the boat's cargo had not been sold and there was no large sum of money, they only stole one hundred and several tens of thousands of yuan in cash, one shi of white rice, and the crew's clothes, quilts, and other items. The boat sailed into the Songjiang anchorage yesterday.</p>

<h3>Six Prisoners Escape from District Court Detention Center; Captured; Sent to District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Six thieves, Lu Wenbin, Wu Fusheng, Huang Muxiang, Ye Shaochun, Chen Changlin, and Tang Shigen, who were detained in the Third Detention Center of the District Court on North Zhejiang Road, had sentences of about ten years each. Lu and others conspired to escape. Huang Muxiang, who had previously worked as a mason, was in charge of breaking through the roof of the fourth floor of the detention center. At 6:00 AM on the 10th of this month (that is, the first day of the lunar new year), the six prisoners climbed out of the hole in the roof and jumped down. Huang Muxiang accidentally lost his footing and fell to the ground, sustaining serious injuries. The other five prisoners jumped to other roofs. At this time, they were spotted by bailiffs, who surrounded and searched for them. Lu Wenbin, Wu Fusheng, and Huang Muxiang were captured first. Ye Shaochun, Chen Changlin, and Tang Shigen, seeing the situation was not good, crawled back into the original hole and were also arrested. Yesterday, the detention center sent the six prisoners to the District Prosecutor's Office, requesting that they be investigated for the crime of escape. After interrogating them, Prosecutor He Huimin determined that the circumstances of the crime were obvious and ordered that they all be detained. Huang Muxiang was injured in the fall, and the detention center was ordered to treat him properly.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Surplus Materials Remaining in India Received in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan began receiving materials remaining in India in Shanghai in the summer of 1946. By the end of December 1947, it had received materials worth more than 22.435 million US dollars, and approximately 1,728 tons of items without a value basis. Among them, the aviation equipment was allocated to the Ministry of National Defense, the ordnance equipment was allocated to the Ordnance Department, and the trucks required approval from President Chiang before they could be allocated. Other types of materials were evaluated and sold by the Materials Supply Bureau. The materials that had been allocated and sold were worth more than 13.171 million US dollars, most of which were Dodge trucks, khaki twill cotton cloth, and tires. The materials remaining in India, also known as Lend-Lease materials, originally belonged to the US Lend-Lease Act and were transported to India by the US during the Chinese War of Resistance. After the end of the war in China, the US military declared them surplus materials. In February 1946, because the US government stipulated that all materials must be purchased at a price before they could be transferred, former President Song decided to purchase them, totaling more than 24 million US dollars (weighing approximately 40,000 tons), which was used to offset the debt in US currency in our country. The above materials were received from the US military stationed in India by the Former Remaining Indian Materials Receiving Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs starting in April 1946. In May, the first batch of materials was shipped from India to Shanghai and handed over to the Shanghai Receiving and Transfer Office of the committee for processing. After the committee was dissolved, it was ordered to transfer the materials to the Materials Supply Bureau for receipt. The unwieldy transportation of the materials left in India was transferred to the Executive Yuan Standing Committee in India for transportation, until the completion of transportation in October 1947. The bureau is still actively receiving and sorting.</p>
<h3>Once in the Spring Breeze, Banknotes Changed Color; Leech Applies Tricks; Scoundrel is Brought Under Control</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Canadian sailor Cheng Lian, feeling bored during his ship's stay, went ashore for a stroll. On the night of the 11th of this month, introduced by a "leech" next to the road, he went to a brothel at 21 Le'an Lane, Kunming Road, to solicit prostitutes. Weilian had 4 million legal tender in his pocket. While he was engrossed and unable to pay attention, the "leech" stole the 4 million legal tender and replaced them with twenty-one 100-yuan notes from the bogus Central Reserve Bank. The next day, Xianlian left the hospital and went shopping by the roadside. When he saw that the banknotes were changing color, he knew something was wrong. After someone explained it to him, he realized that they were counterfeit. He then turned the person in charge of the brothel, Yang Lianbao, over to the Tilanqiao Police Station. The Tilanqiao Police Station transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday, Prosecutor He Huimin interrogated him. Yang confessed: "The brothel was opened by Xiangdi, the wife of Liu Bosu. All the prostitutes had returned home for the Lunar New Year. The leech brought a foreigner on the night of the 11th, and the prostitute was also brought from outside and stayed overnight. I am the caretaker of the brothel and could not refuse. As for the matter of exchanging legal tender with counterfeit money, I am not aware of it. Afterwards, the leech and the prostitute both left and cannot be found." After Yang finished his confession, Prosecutor He ordered Yang to submit a written guarantee of 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Fugitive in Smuggling Supplies to the Bandits Case, "Butterfly" Caught in Linyi</h3>
<p>[Reported from Jinan, 13th, by Dihua Daily, Linyi] According to Dihua Daily, Linyi, Liu Qianmei, nicknamed "Butterfly," wife of Ai Xinghua, the male protagonist in the major smuggling supplies to bandits case cracked in Shanghai last year, is from Datian, Juxian County. She was originally wanted by the government after Ai was arrested. Ai was the person in charge of the Binhai District Cooperative of the bandits. After Ai was arrested, Liu Qianmei went into hiding in Shijiusuo, Rizhao, and her life was still provided for by the bandits. When the bandits fled, she lived with Hao Xishan (from Linyi), who was ordered to impersonate a major staff officer of the Ministry of National Defense. She came to Linyi on the sly a week ago to work as a spy. She was captured by Wang Xianchen, director of the Linyi Police Department, on January 16th. According to her confession, her husband Ai went to Shanghai in May 1946 to buy a car and was arrested. She had received considerable training and served as a literacy class leader. This time she came to Linyi with a major mission. Hao fled upon hearing the news, but after Wang made multiple reconnaissance, he was also arrested. The rest of the gang is currently being investigated.</p>
<h3>Doctor Accused of Bigamy by Wife, Leads Police in Midnight Raid on Love Nest</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Hou Yunqing, 43, a doctor at the Red Cross Hospital on Huashan Road and a native of Nantong, residing at No. 730 Daxilu, has recently been passionately in love with Fang Cailin (21), a woman from Anting, and cohabiting with her at No. 61 Hongye Garden, Yuyuan Road, often not returning home. This led his wife, Zhuang Min (40), to discover this and, after earnest and well-intentioned attempts to dissuade him, found them to be largely ineffective. Filled with resentment, she reported this to the Changning Police Station a few days ago, accusing him of bigamy. At midnight, she accompanied officers Zhu Yunzhang, police chief Zhou Youtian, police officer Li Zonglan, and others to the address, where they apprehended both Hou and Fang and took them to the station. Zhuang Min produced a certificate proving her marriage to Hou on July 13, 1946, at Qiliang Elementary School in Jiading. A witness surnamed Shi was also summoned to the station to confirm its authenticity. Both defendants were then detained and will be referred to the District Procuratorate this morning for investigation.</p>

<p>The above-named defendants were prosecuted by the prosecutor for corruption. This court has heard the case and delivers the following judgment:</p>
<p>Verdict</p>

Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan are each sentenced to death, and Zhang Baohui is sentenced to life imprisonment. All are deprived of their civil rights for life. Furthermore, having continuously acted together to accept bribes for actions that violated their duties, Zhang Yuan was an accomplice. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan are each sentenced to death, and Zhang Baohui is sentenced to life imprisonment. All are deprived of their civil rights for life. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan shall each be executed, and Zhang Baohui shall be imprisoned for life, and all shall be deprived of their civil rights for life.</p>
<p>Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and Zhang Yuan, acting in concert, accepted bribes of 315 million yuan in legal tender from Lifengyong Dye Chemical Company, 800 million yuan in legal tender from Minfu Trading Co., Ltd., 90 million yuan in legal tender from Tianhe and Dakang Dye Shops, and 300 million yuan in legal tender from Yifeng Company. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and Zhang Yuan shall be jointly and severally liable for surrendering the same to the authorities for confiscation.</p>
<p>Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and Zhang Yuan, acting in concert, extorted 8,000 US dollars from Lu Genquan. Apart from the 1,225 US dollars surrendered by Zhang Yuan, which has already been received by Lu Genquan, the remaining 6,775 US dollars, equivalent to 609.75 million yuan in legal tender, shall be jointly and severally surrendered to the authorities by Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and Zhang Yuan, to be received by Lu Genquan.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui all served as assistants at Jianghai Customs. Yin Lansun was the head of the Import License Verification Section of the Appraisal Department of the Customs, while the others served as staff members of the section. They were all responsible for verifying whether goods entering the port were consistent with the import license. Between July and September 1947, the Lungenji Construction Plant, opened by Lu Genquan, ordered 400 tons of galvanized iron sheets (commonly known as "white iron sheets") from Yifeng Company, which were shipped from New York, USA, in batches and arrived in Shanghai. They possessed Import Temporary Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as "Shu Guan Hui") Import Permit No. 14043. All permits named as pre-announcement took November 17, 1946, the date of the promulgation of the Temporary Measures for Revising Import and Export Trade, as the standard for before and after. According to regulations, this permit should be verified by Yin Lansun, the director in charge. It stated that exchange settlement was not allowed, meaning that the Bank of China had already supplied foreign exchange. Since it was not a case of merchants handling their own foreign exchange, it should be released. However, Yin Lansun usually made things difficult, suppressed and leveraged his position to extort property, and colluded with Zhang Yuan, a retired customs officer, to negotiate and receive bribes. This was well known to his colleagues and Shanghai merchants. Moreover, being experienced and capable, he was trusted by his subordinate officials. Mao Yixiang, the general manager of Yifeng Company, taking advantage of Lu Genquan's urgent need for goods and the difficulties caused by the customs officers, colluded with customs broker Fang Maolin. Through Shen Yanlu, Zhang Gaozhen, and Mei Futang, they secretly contacted Yue Xinmin and asked Zhang Yuan to discuss with Yin Lansun. Yin Lansun used the excuse that the permit should be sent to Shu Guan Hui for review and extension, stating that it would not be possible to avoid this without paying a large handling fee. Through Zhang Yuan's collusion with Zhang Baohui, and an implied message from Mei Futang to Zhang Gaozhen, Zhang Gaozhen relayed it to Shen Yanlu and then to Fang Maolin, helping layer by layer to achieve their goals. Mei and others also took advantage of this opportunity, increasing the amount with each pass, ultimately reaching a total of 13,360 US dollars. Unless the full amount was paid, the documents would be withheld. Lu Genquan, unable to bear the increasing daily interest and the stagnation of funds, secretly reported to the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The Bureau secretly ordered him to make the payment in order to ascertain the truth. Indeed, on October 16 and 17, 1947, after paying the full amount, the documents were returned and the goods were allowed to be imported.</p>
<p>Furthermore, between June and October of the same year, Lifengyong Dyestuff Company purchased 100 tons of aniline oil dyes and several other batches of dyes from the United States. Tianhe and Dakang Dyestuff Companies jointly purchased 64 barrels of dyes from the United States. Yifeng Company purchased 150,000 pounds of wool from the United Kingdom. Minfu Company purchased 605 barrels of caustic soda and 17.5 tons of dyes from Hong Kong. These goods were shipped to Shanghai one after another. Lifengyong's aniline oil did not exceed the limit, but other dyes exceeded the quantity or time limit. Tianhe and Dakang borrowed Xin'fu Company's permit. Yifeng's wool exceeded the quantity stated on the permit. Yang Shude was entrusted to find a way to manage these things, and Chen Liangjiong was entrusted to manage Minfu's caustic soda and dyes, which were borrowed from Jinshan Company's dye permit. Therefore, Yang Shutang and Chen Liangjiong separately incited Zhang Yuan to ask Yin Lansun and others to violate their duties, knowingly turning a blind eye and approving the goods in advance. Chen Liangjiong had also agreed with Zhang Yuan in advance to falsely add an item for caustic soda to the permit. Yang Shude and Chen Liangjiong each paid money to Zhang Yuan for distribution. Lifengyong paid bribes of 385 million yuan, Minfu paid 800 million yuan, Tianhe and others paid 90 million yuan, and Yifeng paid 300 million yuan. Zhang Yuan successively brought the money to Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui for distribution. As a result, regardless of whether the import permit should be reviewed by the Shu Guan Hui, corrected, sent for approval, or processed in sequence, the section completed the process ahead of schedule, allowing the goods for which bribes had been paid to be imported smoothly. The Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense discovered this and sent it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court, which ordered the prosecutors of this court to investigate and prosecute.</p>
<p>Reasoning</p>
<p>The evidence on which the above facts are based and the applicable laws will be discussed separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Defendant Yin Lansun's portion: (1) Regarding the case of the import of galvanized iron sheets by Yifeng Company:</p>
<p>The defendant was questioned by this court and stated, "I am responsible for verifying import permits pre-announced. The import permit of Yifeng Company was pre-announced, with no time limit and not related to black market foreign exchange. Zhang Yuan brought the permit and asked me for help. Initially, I wanted him to send it to the Shu Guan Hui's Non-Quota Review Office for study. Later, Shen Chanlu declared the goods, and Yue Xinmin personally told me to let it pass because the permit was supplied foreign exchange by the Bank of China. Zhang Yuan sent me 1,500 US dollars, and I accepted it. In short, my monthly salary is only over 5.5 million. My father died in Tianjin, my mother died early, neither was buried, and I have a wife and children, which is not enough to cover expenses, so I was tempted by money. I ask all levels of superiors for forgiveness." Combined with Zhang Gaozhen's statement, "Zhang Yuan said that if 8,000 US dollars were not sent to the customs, the form would not be issued," it is sufficient to confirm his difficulties, suppression, and extortion of property. Moreover, Mao Fengxiang stated that "Fang Maolin first wanted a customs clearance fee of 50 million yuan, then 7%, 8%, and finally 15%, which was calculated as 12,260 US dollars, and then increased by another 1,000 US dollars. This 1,000 US dollars was because the bill of lading was still not returned after the fee was paid, and they wanted to increase it by 2,000 before agreeing to add another 1,000 US dollars," while Lu Genquan said, "Mao Fengxiang wanted 16% during the first negotiation, which was later reduced to 15%, calculated as 13,360 US dollars, or 119,718 million yuan in legal tender." The fact that 16% was wanted during the first negotiation is sufficient to prove that the defendants' internal extortion amount, step-by-step increase, is a deliberate distortion of their words by the defendants to avoid suspicion of collusion. The agreement between them was confirmed. Otherwise, the facilitator would have demanded a 16% customs clearance fee during the first negotiation with the victim, instead of saying that only 7% or 8% was needed. From this, it can be concluded that the defendants' joint extortion of a large sum of money was consistent, and the defendant, who was in charge of verification, was greedy and unrestrained, disregarding the government's intention to punish corruption and promote honesty in government. His crime is extremely heinous, and he cannot presumptuously seek forgiveness.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the case of Lifengyong and other companies importing foreign goods:</p>
<p>The defendant stated, "Lifengyong's aniline oil and other goods wanted me to pass them early and sent me 20 million yuan. For Yifeng's wool import, I was on sick leave. Zhang Yuan came to my house and said that the wool import had been approved by Zhang Baohui and Yue Xinmin, and they sent you 20 million yuan. The import of Minfu's caustic soda and dyes was also Zhang Yuan asking me to accommodate them and sending me 3,000 US dollars. I don't know about Tianhe and Dakang's affairs." He also stated, "I successively borrowed 60 million yuan from Zhang Yuan, and he said I didn't have to pay it back because I usually helped him a lot." Checking the customs declarations, there should be a sequence, and it is wrong to receive bribes and permit the import in advance. Verification of documents is mandatory and one cannot act arbitrarily. Now, due to receiving bribes, one is said to be "early" and the other is said to be "accommodated," which is sufficient to prove that they jointly committed acts that violated their duties with Yue Xinmin and Zhang Baohui, with Zhang Yuan as an accomplice. Moreover, Lifengyong's several batches of dyes either did not match the names of the goods listed in the original permit, borrowed the permit of another company, or had no permit at all. Minfu's dyes and 60 tons of industrial raw materials were using Jinshan Company's permit, and the 605 barrels of caustic soda had no permit at all. It was because they agreed with Chen Liangjiong, who had discussed with Zhang Yuan, that the item for caustic soda was added to the above permit. Tianhe and Dakang jointly shipped 64 barrels of dyes to Shanghai, but only had bills of lading and sales contracts, without an import permit. Yifeng's 150,000 tons of wool shipped to Shanghai exceeded the amount stated on the permit by several times, and the permit had expired. All were in the category of not being allowed to import, as stated clearly by Yang Shude, Chen Liangjiong, and Zhang Yuan, and confirmed by the documents attached to the case. However, the defendant still argued, "The unscrupulous merchants are too bad and deceive us in various ways, making it difficult to verify," and so on. If that were the case, why were things made difficult and suppressed before Zhang Yuan accepted the bribe, and why were all approved early after Zhang Yuan handed over the bribe? Why was the bribe still delivered to his home while he was on sick leave? Why borrow as much as 60 million yuan from Zhang Yuan, a colleague who had resigned and was idle in Shanghai, and be exempt from repaying it due to his usual help? It can be seen that he colluded with Zhang Yuan to hand over and negotiate matters outside. Therefore, regardless of the number of times, the defendants' prior and subsequent joint intent to violate their duties was consistent and unambiguous, and should be considered continuous crimes.</p>
<p>(2) Defendant Yue Min's portion</p>
<p>Checking the defendant's statements regarding the various instances of allowing the galvanized iron sheets of Yihang Company, the aniline oil of Lifengyong Company, the dyes of Tianhe and Dakang Companies, the wool of Yifeng Company, and the bait and caustic soda of Minfu Company to be cleared in advance, there are some inconsistencies in his confessions. However, after being questioned by this court, he stated, "I successively received 3,000 US dollars each from Yifeng and Minfu, and also received 20 to 30 million yuan in legal tender, the exact amount of which I don't remember. Yin Lansun is very secretive and trusted by his superiors. Zhang Yuan relays everything to me, and I cannot speak directly to him." This is generally consistent with the previous statements of the co-conspirators and the defendant during the investigations by the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense and the Prosecutor's Office of this court, as well as his confession (see pages 68 to 70 of the first volume of the Bureau's file). Moreover, referring to the various documents attached to the case, it is undoubtedly that he committed the crime jointly with Yin Lansun and others. Now, let's discuss whether this part and the other cases he committed stemmed from a comprehensive criminal intent. He stated, "Zhang Gaozhen asked me to do it, and Yin Lansun, Zhang Gaozhen, and others are bad people. Don't associate with them. I returned the things (referring to the invoices, bills of lading, permits, etc.) to Zhang Gaozhen. Later, Zhang Gaozhen said that Mei Futang had agreed to send 8,000 US dollars, and Director Yin agreed to it. I received 3,000 US dollars. They (referring to Zhang Yuan, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui) each received 1,500 US dollars, and the rest was used for miscellaneous expenses." According to Zhang Gaozhen's statement, "If 8,000 US dollars were not given, the form would not be issued," it is undoubtedly that they jointly extorted property. Since this part is different from the continuous crime of receiving bribes for violating duties, and the intention stemmed from the defendant himself, it cannot be considered to have stemmed from a comprehensive criminal intent and should be treated separately.</p>

Mr. Wu is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing today (the 14th). Regarding the Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in this city, they were submitted to the Municipal Council for approval on January 30th and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for appropriate revisions. The detailed implementation rules for rice rationing have been drafted by the People's Food Allocation Committee and approved by yesterday's Municipal Council meeting. Director Wu will present these measures and implementation rules for discussion at the Five City Mayors' Meeting in Beijing. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in Shanghai</p>
<p>1. In order to regulate the food supply for the people, the City of Shanghai will conduct a trial implementation of rice rationing by population from March to June of the 37th year (1948), and these measures are specifically established for this purpose.</p>
<p>2. During the trial period of rice rationing by population, all citizens of Shanghai must purchase rice with the rice purchase certificates issued by the government, and all rice shops must sell rice upon presentation of the certificates.</p>
<p>3. Citizens aged seven and above are considered "large mouths" and may purchase no more than two shi dou of rice per month. Those under the age of seven are considered "small mouths" and may purchase no more than one shi dou of rice per month.</p>
<p>4. Regardless of whether a citizen is considered "large mouth" or "small mouth," the government will allocate and sell one shi dou of rice per month at a fixed price, supplied equally from U.S. relief rice and government-reserved rice.</p>
<p>5. In addition to the rice allocated and sold by the government, "large mouth" citizens may purchase no more than one shi dou of rice from rice shops at market prices.</p>
<p>6. Hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and other establishments with transient populations may purchase rice at market prices from rice shops with the government-issued quota rice purchase certificates.</p>
<p>7. The rice rationing by population will be handled by the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee, and all agencies under the Municipal Government should provide full assistance.</p>
<p>8. These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the Municipal Council and ratified by the Executive Yuan. The detailed implementation rules shall be drafted by the People's Food Allocation Committee and implemented after being approved by the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Detailed Implementation Rules for the Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in Shanghai</p>
<p>1. These detailed rules are formulated in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Measures for Rice Rationing by Population in Shanghai.</p>
<p>2. U.S. relief rice and government-reserved rice are collectively referred to as "rationed rice." Rice that is permitted to be purchased from rice shops at market prices is referred to as "permitted purchase rice."</p>
<p>3. Rice purchase certificates are divided into three types: household registration rice purchase certificates, temporary rice purchase certificates, and special rice purchase certificates, which are printed and issued by the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee.</p>
<p>(A) Household registration rice purchase certificates are applicable to citizens with household registration in the city. "Large mouth" rice purchase certificates are divided into two sections. The first section specifies one shi dou of rationed rice (actual weight of fifteen shi jin) and the rationing period (divided into the first half of the month, from the 1st to the 12th, and the second half of the month, from the 16th to the 27th). The second section is divided into five grids, each specifying two shi sheng of permitted purchase rice and the effective month. Each section and grid can be used separately. "Small mouth" rice purchase certificates only have one section for rationed rice.</p>
<p>(B) Temporary rice purchase certificates are applicable to people who have just arrived in Shanghai and are in the process of registering their household registration, or to people who are staying temporarily in the homes of relatives and friends.</p>
<p>(C) Special rice purchase certificates are applicable to transient populations in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and passing ships. Each certificate specifies one shi dan or five shi dan of permitted purchase rice and the effective month.</p>
<p>4. Based on the household registration survey statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, before the 25th of last month, the People's Food Allocation Committee will issue the household registration rice purchase certificates to the district offices for receipt. After receiving the rice purchase certificates, the district offices should, within two days, jointly with representatives of the district people's representative assembly, issue them to the neighborhood offices for receipt. After receiving the household registration rice purchase certificates, the neighborhood offices should, within three days, issue them to each household for receipt.</p>
<p>5. People who have just arrived in Shanghai and are in the process of registering their household registration, or people who are staying temporarily in the homes of relatives and friends, can apply to the district office for a temporary rice purchase certificate after obtaining proof from the neighborhood chief. The quantity is calculated based on the number of days (six ge per person per day, regardless of whether they are "large mouth" or "small mouth") and is limited to permitted purchase rice. The district office should register the issuance of temporary rice purchase certificates every ten days and report to the People's Food Allocation Committee for record.</p>
<p>6. The rice needed for the transient population in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, etc., shall be determined by the relevant competent authorities and transferred to the People's Food Allocation Committee for the issuance of special rice purchase certificates. The rice needed for the transient population on passing ships, etc., shall be pre-issued by the People's Food Allocation Committee to the district offices for a certain number of shi dan of special rice purchase certificates. When applications are received, the district offices shall verify and issue them, and report to the People's Food Allocation Committee for record every ten days.</p>
<p>7. The price of rationed rice will be set once a month and announced on the first day of each month.</p>
<p>8. The distribution of rationed rice: (1) All rice shops in each district of the city that are legally registered with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and that have obtained guarantees from two trade associations or legally registered businesses; (2) Cooperatives and social service centers in each district may apply to the People's Food Allocation Committee to undertake this task. These rice shops, cooperatives, and social service centers undertaking this task are all referred to as "grain rationing shops" (application form and guarantee form attached) and are given a number. The Social Affairs Bureau should first compile a list of legally registered rice shops before the end of January of the 36th year (1947) and assign them numbers, along with cooperatives and social service centers in each district that undertake grain rationing, and send the list to the Food Allocation Committee for rice allocation. The rice for the first half of the next month must be allocated by the end of the previous month, and the rice for the second half of the month must be allocated during the first half of the month.</p>
<p>9. Grain rationing shops are given a handling fee of 5% of the sales price for distributing rationed rice (deducted daily). If their performance is excellent, they may be given a bonus of 2%. This will be paid at the end of each month or every two months (depending on the session schedule of the district people's representative assembly).</p>
<p>10. Citizens may choose the grain rationing shop or rice shop they trust to purchase rationed rice and permitted purchase rice, but only within the jurisdiction of their district.</p>
<p>11. The total amount of rationed rice and permitted purchase rice purchased by each household from the grain rationing shop or rice shop each time shall not exceed three shi dan. If the total amount of rice needed by each household exceeds three shi dan, it should be purchased in installments within the time limit specified in Article 3.</p>
<p>12. The rice needed for collective living in factories, schools, etc., may be applied for by factories, schools, etc., by collecting the household registration rice purchase certificates of their employees and paying the fees to the People's Food Allocation Committee, and directly withdrawing the rice from the warehouse.</p>
<p>13. Grain rationing shops should publicly display samples of the rationed rice they are selling with labels attached.</p>
<p>14. Grain rationing shops should prepare an adhesive book to paste the first section of the household registration rice purchase certificates (rationed rice). Each page is limited to 100 certificates. Except for the last page, which may have an odd number of certificates, all other pages must not have any omissions. The date should be clearly marked on each certificate pasted in the book every day, and the total number of certificates sold on that day should be calculated for verification. At the end of each month, the adhesive book, along with the monthly report, should be sent to the People's Food Allocation Committee for review. Any remaining rice may be carried over to the next month's sales volume.</p>
<p>15. Grain rationing shops should remit the rice money sold on the previous day to the designated bank or postal remittance branch for collection every day and obtain a payment receipt for verification.</p>
<p>16. Grain rationing shops should list the quantity sold and the amount of money paid on the same day every day and send it to the district office for record. At mid-month and end-month, accounts should be cleared (daily report and half-monthly report forms attached, to be prepared by the grain rationing shops according to the format).</p>
<p>17. All kinds of rice purchase certificates must not be transferred or assigned. If the above circumstances are violated, the buyer and seller shall be fined five times the amount for the first offense, and the penalty shall be doubled for each subsequent offense.</p>
<p>18. Personnel at all levels must not issue or withhold rice purchase certificates indiscriminately. Violators will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>19. Grain rationing shops that have excellent performance in distributing rationed rice may be given a bonus of 2% of the sales price of the distribution volume upon the suggestion of the district people's representative assembly and the approval of the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee.</p>
<p>20. If a grain rationing shop has any of the following circumstances, it may be given one of the following penalties, depending on the severity of the circumstances: (1) cancellation of the distribution, (2) temporary suspension of business, or (3) permanent closure of business. The People's Food Allocation Committee may request the Social Affairs Bureau to handle this.</p>
<p>(A) Cannot obtain the trust of the citizens and sells less than 60 shi dan of rationed rice per month.</p>
<p>(B) Deducts the quantity, which is verified after being reported by the citizens.</p>
<p>(C) Exchanges and sells inferior quality rice.</p>
<p>(D) Adulterates the rice.</p>
<p>(E) Misappropriates the sales money for rationed rice and does not handle it according to regulations.</p>
<p>(F) Fails to submit reports on time.</p>
<p>21. Rice shops selling permitted purchase rice should, according to the method in Article 14, prepare an adhesive book to paste and save the permitted purchase certificates. At the end of each month, the total number should be calculated as the monthly business volume of the rice shop and reported to the district office and the Food Allocation Committee for record. The Food Allocation Committee will compile a general register based on this and send it to the Social Affairs Bureau for record.</p>
<p>22. Rice shops purchasing rice from the rice market shall temporarily use the business volume stipulated in Article 21 as the standard and shall not exceed 20% of the total business volume of the previous month, and must go through registration procedures with the personnel stationed in the market by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>23. Remaining rice in the market may be applied to the Food Allocation Committee for mortgage or purchase.</p>
<p>24. In order to handle rice rationing, the Food Allocation Committee should send personnel to reside in each district to be responsible for assisting the work of the district chief and may send personnel to guide and audit at any time.</p>
<p>25. These detailed rules will be promulgated and implemented after being resolved by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Weighing the Pros and Cons, I Had to Resort to This Policy</p>
<p>A few hours after Mussolini declared war, Premier Reynaud and his government, before leaving Paris, telegraphed a dramatic appeal to President Roosevelt, asking him to publicly announce that the United States would support the Allied Powers in every way except sending an expeditionary force.</p>
<p>He said, "We will fight before Paris, we will fight after Paris. We will fight in one province, and if we are driven out of that province, we will establish ourselves in North Africa and continue fighting, and if necessary, we will fight in our territories in the Americas."</p>
<p>The Premier and I knew that the French could neither fight before Paris, nor fight after Paris, nor fight in one province. (What Reynaud had in mind was the province of Brittany.) But France could still maintain control of its fleet, retreat to North Africa, and continue fighting there.</p>
<p>Although we had the best of intentions and good will in the world, we also knew that we had material and political limits in aiding France. The Battle of France was, in fact, already over, and there was simply no way we could stop Hitler from conquering France. So we tried to issue a reply to encourage Reynaud and his government to continue fighting in North Africa and to maintain the integrity of the French fleet.</p>
<p>German troops occupied Paris on July 14, the day before the President issued his reply. Ambassador Bullitt assisted the military mayor in handing over this undefended city to the Germans without bloodshed. Bullitt stayed behind on his own accord, not going with the French government to Tours, and then to Bordeaux. He believed that staying in Paris under German occupation (at least temporarily) could contribute more to the Allied Powers and the people of Paris than fleeing with the French government. He had in mind the actions of American Ambassador Herrick, who stayed in Paris during World War I and did not go to Bordeaux with the French government.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this decision was unfortunate. During the critical week from June 10, when the French government left Paris, to June 17, when it requested an armistice, Bullitt was unable to maintain any contact with the French government. If Bullitt could have represented us during those historic days, then his unparalleled close relationship with the leaders of the French government might have led the government to take the fleet to North Africa and continue fighting from there.</p>
<p>Bullitt's position was taken over by Ambassador Biddle, who had previously been our representative to the Polish government in exile in Paris. Biddle was an excellent diplomat. But in terms of his relationship with and influence over the French government, he could not compare with Bullitt.</p>
<p>When the German troops reached Paris, Bullitt communicated directly with the President because he knew that the State Department would oppose the recommendations he was about to make. So he contacted the President personally. He suggested staying in Paris and not going with the French government.</p>
<p>Bullitt communicated with the President directly by phone and telegraph on many occasions. He also set up a private code specifically for communicating with the President. This method of operation reached its peak during the painful days of France's defeat. As a result, the State Department was sometimes completely unaware of what Bullitt was thinking and doing, although the President informed me of many of the messages from Bullitt and always provided me with full information when I inquired about a particular issue. Mr. Roosevelt enjoyed the dramatic side of diplomatic work and therefore did not object to this method.</p>
<p>When I learned of Bullitt's suggestion, I went to see the President. I told him that I opposed this method and believed that our ambassador should go with the French government. In my opinion, Bullitt's influence over the German occupying authorities in Paris would be minimal because his strong anti-Nazi sentiments were well known to the German government. But on the other hand, his influence over the French government could be decisive.</p>
<p>So the President personally called Bullitt. He told the ambassador that he (the President) and I believed that he should leave Paris with the French government. The argument he put forward was that Bullitt might be assassinated by communists or Nazis because he was long hated by both. Bullitt said that he could not escape danger and argued strongly, finally causing the President to abandon his opposition.</p>
<p>In Tours, and later in Bordeaux, Ambassador Biddle continued this struggle, visiting Reynaud, Pétain, Naval Minister Admiral Darlan, Daladier, and others repeatedly, reiterating our view that France should continue to resist while its navy remained intact. Biddle's dispatches provided vivid accounts of the disputes within the French cabinet, with Reynaud opposing the armistice, Pétain supporting it, and, outside the cabinet, the vile Laval beginning to exert his influence in preparation for surrender</p>
<p>So, on the night of June 16, Reynaud resigned, Pétain formed a new cabinet, with Baudouin as Foreign Minister and Admiral Darlan as Naval Minister, and sought an armistice.</p>
<p>The British and American governments struggled to ensure the safety of the French navy. Churchill sent his Naval Minister, his First Sea Lord, and his Colonial Minister to Bordeaux to represent him. After discussing the situation with the President, I sent Ambassador Biddle one of the strongest telegrams in my career, telling him to convey it to the Pétain government.</p>
<p>I said, "The President hopes you will say that, in the opinion of our government, if the French government fails to ensure that its fleet does not fall into enemy hands before signing any armistice agreement with the Germans, then the French government will cause serious damage to the preservation of the French Empire and the ultimate restoration of French independence and autonomy. Furthermore, if the French government fails to take such steps and allows the French fleet to surrender to Germany, then the French government will forever lose the friendship and goodwill of the American government."</p>
<p>This message was almost reckless, but given the situation, only a strong message might have some effect.</p>
<p>On June 18, as Darlan was about to attend a cabinet meeting, Biddle handed him this telegram. Biddle visited Baudouin while the cabinet meeting was in progress and gave him a copy. Although Baudouin seemed extremely angry about the strong language in the note in Biddle’s opinion, he and Darlan still placed it before the cabinet. The government then decided that under no circumstances would the fleet be handed over to the Germans, and if the surrender of the navy was included in the German conditions, the armistice should be rejected.</p>
<p>The French fleet was not the only thing we were concerned about. We were also concerned about what might happen to the British fleet. Now that France had succumbed, Hitler could transfer all his forces to deal with Britain. The President and I believed that Britain could and would be able to successfully resist the Nazi invasion, but in the Americas and Europe, many people held the same view as Pétain and his ilk, believing that Britain would be conquered or reconciled within weeks.</p>
<p>When British Ambassador Lothian came to see me on June 11, he said that he had received a suggestion from Churchill advocating that naval officers from our two governments hold staff talks to discuss fleet movements in the Atlantic and Pacific. I replied that I doubted there would be an opportunity to hold staff talks, but I was happy to convey this suggestion to the President.</p>
<p>Lothian asked me if his military attaché could discuss with the appropriate officials in the War Department the effects of Anglo-French bombing inside Germany. I said that I was sure that our military personnel would be happy to provide his military attaché with any information within their capabilities, although we could not engage in the exchange of such information. Later, I tried to get his military attaché to discuss this issue with the War Department and asked our consular officials stationed in Germany to inform us of the results of British bombing of Germany at any time.</p>
<p>On June 24, I talked to Lothian again about the arrangements for the British fleet. He reiterated his suggestion that the appropriate army and navy officers of our two governments hold staff talks. Such a meeting would be extremely important if the British government had to retreat with its remaining fleet to Canada. But this could only happen in the event of British failure, which Lothian and I simply did not think of at the time.</p>
<p>I pointed out that, at least at this stage, the exchange of information was better conducted through diplomatic officials than through army and navy officers. What the President and I were concerned about was that the news of the military staff talks might "leak out" and allow opponents of the government and isolationists to accuse the President of trying to get the United States involved in the war.</p>
<p>A dramatic solution to the French fleet problem finally came on July 3, although the solution was only partial. At that time, the British took over the French warships stationed in British ports. They informed the French admiral commanding a squadron in Alexandria that they would sink them if he tried to take them to France and allow them to fall under German control. They also sent an ultimatum to a French admiral commanding a large part of the French fleet near Mers-el-Kébir near Oran in North Africa. The ultimatum required the French warships at Mers-el-Kébir to join the British fleet, or to sail to British, West Indian, or American ports to be detained. When the French admiral refused, the British opened fire immediately, rendering most of the French ships inoperable and killing more than a thousand Frenchmen. I felt indescribable grief and could not restrain myself from this tragic rupture between Britain and France.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, near the end of December 1941, Mr. Churchill was coming to visit the President. At one of the banquets given by the President in honor of this distinguished guest, I sat between the Prime Minister and a British admiral. This admiral asked me how I felt about the British attack on the French fleet in Oran. I evaded this question because I did not want to cause a dispute between him and Mr. Churchill, because I had heard that the British navy had opposed the invasion and that there had been considerable disagreement within the British government. But a few minutes later, I raised the subject with Mr. Churchill himself. He said categorically that the Vichy government could not be trusted and that it would hand over the fleet to the Germans if it was attacked. He also said that British prestige was at its lowest ebb at the time, and he wanted to use this action to raise it around the world, indicating that Britain was still going to fight.</p>
<p>Bullitt left Paris a few days after the German troops entered and met Pétain, Laval, Baudouin, and others in Vichy on July 4, the day after the British attack on the French fleet. He telegraphed me on the 5th that their reaction was extremely fierce. Some cabinet members advocated going to war with Britain immediately, but Pétain was firmly opposed to any action beyond breaking off diplomatic relations. Pétain said that only when Hitler was defeated by some other country could France regain its independence, so he sincerely hoped that Britain would win. He wanted to reduce the seriousness of the break with Britain, saying that it was due to Churchill's personal failure to weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<h3>A Bitter Pill: American Citizens Petition Truman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, New York, 3rd Dispatch] Billy Rose, a former typist with nimble hands, still holds the world record for high-speed typing. During World War I, he was Bernard Baruch's secretary. Since then, he has worked in many industries, especially making a name for himself in the Broadway entertainment scene. His performances at the New York World's Fair were particularly praised. In addition to performing, he also ran the highly regarded "Diamond Horseshoe" nightclub. He earned a great deal of money and became quite wealthy. Recently, he has been writing, penning as many as five columns a week. The following translation is one of his recent letters, from which one can see how close the relationship between the American people and the President is.</p>
<p>Dear President,</p>
<p>From where I stand, it seems that the electors are not preparing to let you continue renting that Shevanee Street apartment. Everyone is aiming for a goal, and when they achieve it, as seen in the last election, they vote for someone else. Mr. President, the reason I am writing to you is because I want you to continue living in the White House. In my eyes, you are undeniably</p>
<p>a good man</p>
<p>, and I think you have good intentions. I suspect the people of the country generally hold the same view. But frankly, we are all somewhat uneasy. We know our country has some problems, although we don't know exactly what they are. When you are sick, you don't feel well, and you need a doctor who knows how to prescribe the right medicine.</p>
<p>The purpose of this letter is to suggest that you summon such a doctor and bring him into the White House, so that he can prescribe a remedy whenever the government is unwell. And there is only one such doctor that the people trust. That is our old friend Mr. Baruch. He has been taking the nation's pulse and telling us why it is beating too fast or too slow for thirty years. Unfortunately, we</p>
<p>have not taken all his prescriptions</p>
<p>, because that old doctor will prescribe a nasty bitter pill when he deems it necessary. If the news that the old gentleman is living next door to you gets out, it will certainly boost morale and improve your political chances. I don't think Mrs. Truman would object either. Mr. Baruch is a very up-to-date citizen, with the demeanor of a Southerner, and looks kind. He doesn't drink, never drops ashes on the carpet, and is known for his generosity in tipping. I think he will definitely enhance your reputation.</p>
<p>I know you will agree that you would have found it very convenient to have that old doctor at your side for the past two months. You have to deliver the annual</p>
<p>State of the Union Address</p>
<p>in Congress, which is an important speech for any president. Undoubtedly, you and the staff in the White House drafted this speech all night. What was the result of your collective efforts? A clumsy proposal to give forty dollars to everyone who votes for you in the next election. It's like telling a cancer patient to take an aspirin every time it rains.</p>
<p>A few days after you delivered your speech, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee consulted Dr. Baruch about his thoughts on the Marshall Plan and several other issues. Our old statesman put forward a detailed and thorough world recovery plan. In just three thousand words, he told us about inflation, prices, wages, and other</p>
<p>world problems</p>
<p>and how to handle them. The only newspaper that published his prescription was "The Wall Street Journal," which made you realize how brilliant a doctor Baruch is!</p>
<p>But getting back to the main point, let's talk about that old doctor living in the White House. If you had been drinking orange juice with him for the past two months, that Baruch plan would probably have become the Truman plan by now.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example to illustrate how valuable this old doctor would be to the White House. Recently, many people have opposed your desire to build</p>
<p>a balcony</p>
<p>in the White House. If Mr. Baruch lived with you, things would be much easier. "We need this balcony so that our old friend can sit there and bask in the sun and come up with designs for us." That reason alone would be enough, and even many people who trust this doctor would volunteer to supply wood and nails and insist on building that balcony.</p>
<p>Am I suggesting that you shouldn't reuse the bright young things in the White House who are helping you now? Absolutely not. I've seen their pictures, and they all seem like good kids. In fact, they will also find it convenient after Mr. Baruch comes in. The old doctor likes chocolate soda, and in the summer, other colleagues will be happy to go to the drugstore to buy him a bottle. Mr. President, please think about it, if you went to the drugstore yourself, you might get a lot of votes.</p>
<h3>Blazing War in Northeast: Factories and Mines Deep in Peril</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th Dispatch] The Northeast possesses the most dazzling mineral deposits in Asia and is the foundation of China's industrial development. The Northeast is China's lifeline. This is not just an emotional cry, but a rational theory. Unfortunately, after the restoration, 70% of the industrial and mining equipment was dismantled and removed by the Soviet army. The remaining parts were subsequently disrupted and damaged by the communist bandits, causing even greater damage. After two and a half years, the Northeast's factories and mines have been shrinking day by day, and today they have reached a precarious state. The Chinese people should rise up urgently to reverse this historical trend.</p>
<p>To rescue the Northeast's factories and mines, the primary issue is to quell the rebellion, because this is the disinfection work to heal the wounds of the factories and mines. The factories and mines can only survive in stability. At present, the Northeast is in a state of war, and the banditry has not yet ended. The situation of the factories and mines is extremely dangerous. Leaving aside the misfortunes suffered by private factories and mines, even the state-owned factories and mines, the National Resources Commission operated in the Northeast</p>
<p>light and heavy industries and mines</p>
<p>including twenty-six units, were established separately after October of the thirty-fifth year, started production, and quickly sought to recover, thriving. By May of the thirty-sixth year, they had recovered to a considerable extent, and the future was very promising. Unfortunately, after May of that year, the banditry was rampant, and the factories and mines were the first to suffer, all suffering heavy losses, and the wounds deepened day by day. Up to now, most of the mines are unable to continue production due to environmental pressures, and cannot "sit idly by and consume resources", so they have decided to shrink and lay off employees. According to the current situation of each mine, there are five states: continuing to start work, maintaining the status quo, temporary custody, waiting for resumption of work, and closing down the institution:</p>
<p>Those who continue to start work</p>
<p>are the Fushun Mining Bureau, the Northeast Electric Power Bureau (Fushun and Fengman power plants), Benxi Coal and Iron Company, Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Company, Shenyang Rubber Factory (Rubber No. 1 Shoe Factory, Rubber Belt Factory, and Automobile Tire Factory), and the Northeast District of the Telecommunications Office. Six units in total.</p>
<p>Those who maintain the status quo</p>
<p>are Central Machinery Company Shenyang Machinery Factory, (the factory's original operating conditions were the best among all units, but now there is no sales of products), Shenyang Rolling Stock Factory, Central Electrical Equipment Factory, (only the motor repair shop is open), Shenyang Chemical Factory, (product caustic soda hydrochloric acid sales are stagnant), Liuning Cement Company, (only the Benxi factory is working), and Hanxin Coal Mining Company. Six units in total.</p>
<p>Those in temporary custody</p>
<p>are Beipiao Coal Mining Company (Jinzhou), Yingcheng Four Mines Receiving Committee (Changchun), Yantai Coal Mine (Fanyang), Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Northeast Metal Mining Company, Central Insulation Equipment Company Fushun Factory, China Petroleum Corporation Northeast Rotten Oil Factory (Jinxi), Liaoning Pulp and Paper Company, and North China Cement Company (Jinxi). Nine units in total.</p>
<p>Institutions to be abolished</p>
<p>There are three units: the Northeast Branch of the Xi'an Coal Mining Company Materials Office and the Shenyang Branch of the Insurance Office.</p>
<p>Huludao Sulfuric Acid Plant is waiting for resumption of work. Sulfuric acid is the mother of the chemical industry. The reason why the plant stopped work in the past was due to transportation difficulties and lack of containers for products. Now that these two problems are solved, production will be resumed soon.</p>
<p>The above is the true face of the industrial and mining industry in the Northeast, the cradle of war. Don't ignore today's crisis and its impact on the future. Mr. Fu Mengzhen said: "With the Northeast, China is like India; without the Northeast, China is just Italy." These are really alarming words. Professor Fei Wenzhong, after returning from his inspection of the Northwest, wrote an article expressing his feelings, believing that the Chinese people's vision for industrial construction should be shifted from the Northeast to the Northwest. His view of "reaping in the evening" is difficult for those who understand the resources of the Northeast to agree with. Just ask the engineers who went south from the Northeast and they will know. Today, what we regret is not only the trampling of industrial and mining equipment and the harm to engineering talents, but also the irreparable losses. (Our reporter Zhao Zhan)</p>
<h3>Distributing Rice: Poor People in Jiashan Celebrate the New Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiashan, 8th Dispatch] The county's Winter Relief Committee is actively carrying out relief work.

<h3>Relieving the Spring Famine: Jiangsu Province Plans to Regulate Food for the People</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th Dispatch] Food in various counties of Jiangsu Province is in short supply due to inconvenient transportation, and because the security of the production areas in northern Jiangsu has not been fully established. The spring famine is approaching in a blink of an eye. The province is preparing early to avoid shortages. The Land and Food Department has formulated a plan to regulate food for the people, which has been approved by the provincial government meeting. The main points are three: (1) Request the central government to allocate a large sum of money to purchase food and provide relief to Jiangsu. (2) Relax food loans so that food merchants can directly purchase from rice-producing areas. (3) Order all counties and cities to establish food regulation committees to organize fair prices to help the people's food. This plan has also been reported to the Executive Yuan by the provincial government and consulted with relevant departments for record.</p>

<h3>Changzhou North Township: Conscription Turns Into a Full-Scale Fight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 12th Dispatch] Sanhekou and Xin'an Towns in the northern township of this county previously competed fiercely for the election of senators after merging townships. The sense of grievance among the people of the two townships has not been eliminated until now. This time, the township was merged, and Sanhekou Town insisted on merging the two baos of Dongyao and Xiyao, which originally belonged to Xin'an, into Hekou. Xin'an Township firmly refused, and the matter went to the Civil Affairs Department, but a satisfactory solution has not yet been reached. This time, in the emergency conscription, Sanhekou Township was allocated four quotas. When the deadline was reached, no soldier was conscripted in the township. In order to achieve success, the county government specially sent a military instructor, Xu, to the town to urge the conscription. Zhu Yuting, the head of the township of the township, said that three young men from Sanhekou could be sent to the city, but one from Dongxiyao had to be picked up by the instructor himself. Instructor Xu, after learning the situation, personally led four members of the Hekou Self-Defense Force to Dongxiyao Village early in the morning of the 7th, carrying a box gun. They tied up the old Bao chief Yao and brought him back to Hekou to hand over the young men. The whole village was in an uproar and rushed to report to Xin'an Township. Local people, more than a hundred people, rushed to Sanhekou, destroying the grocery store opened by the head of the township Zhu Xingting. Zhu Xingting fled through the back door and was not beaten. They recognized the instructor Xu and the four members of the Self-Defense Force as kidnappers and arrested them. Two members of the Self-Defense Force, seeing the situation was bad, abandoned their guns and fled one after another. The other two members of the Self-Defense Force failed to escape and were arrested. The instructor Xu was interrogated one by one. When the Xin'an contingent arrived at Sanhekou, the township self-defense force of Hekou East Street and the county security team of West Street were dispatched to guard the area and set up machine guns. The situation was like facing a formidable enemy. Fortunately, no disaster occurred. The Xin'an people were only watched swarming away. Afterwards, Sanhekou reported to the county government, accusing Xin'an of riot. Both sides are actively dispatching troops and preparing for a major lawsuit. As of the time of writing, Instructor Xu has been released and returned to the city. The 8th was a Sunday and the end of the lunar year, and the county government has not yet taken any emergency measures.</p>

<h3>Baoshan Military Service Handled Poorly: Fu Zhengmo Sends Personnel to Investigate Secretly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Recently, a reader wrote to this newspaper, exposing the corrupt situation in the handling of military service in Baoshan County. After the reporter went to the local area and visited the people on the spot, it was found that there were indeed incidents of catching young men from house to house and illegally embezzling in this conscription. For example, in the Sixth Bao of the county, an old woman surnamed Zhao was imprisoned by the county government because her son was selected and absconded, and has not been released to this day. In addition, Xu Genquan, a young man who was selected in Beimen, was the only son of several houses. After being arrested this time, his family was extremely panic-stricken. After negotiation, 15 million yuan was used to redeem Xu Genquan. There are many similar situations. The reporter specially visited Commander Fu Zhengmo of the Shanghai Division District for this matter and told him what he had seen and heard in Baoshan County. The commander said that regarding the alleged illegal corruption in the handling of Qiu service in Baoshan County, the department has already sent Colonel Inspector Lu Zhengqi to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. According to the investigation results, Xu Genquan is a young man who is solely responsible for the family's livelihood. Because he did not go through the procedures for deferring enlistment in accordance with the law, he was selected and enlisted. Later, 33 million yuan was released. Wang Zhongwu, the mayor of the town, and Qiu Baozhong, the deputy mayor, are indeed suspected of promising money. Mayor Wang is currently being detained by the county government for interrogation. In addition, a certain Zhao was imprisoned by the county government because his son was selected and absconded, which is also a fact. As for the allegation that many more family members were implicated in this conscription and many similar fraud cases occurred, because the investigation has not yet obtained conclusive evidence, it is still difficult to consider it a fact. Fu Zhengmo solemnly stated: The department has strictly ordered the Baoshan County Magistrate to investigate and deal with the corrupt and illegal persons in accordance with the law and report them. In the future, in addition to ensuring that all localities strictly abide by the laws and regulations in the conscription of new recruits, it is hoped that all sectors of society will provide as much factual information as possible to the department for reporting if they have any opinions on military service or find any illegal corruption. If the investigation has conclusive evidence, it will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. Regarding the responsibility of the family members of the deserters, Fu said that the local authorities can question their family members, and arbitrarily detaining them is not in accordance with the law. If a man who is solely responsible for the family's livelihood applies for the procedure first, he can defer enlistment. In addition, in the department's conscription this year, except for Taicang County, which is collecting applications and implementing them, all other counties are publicly drawing lots, and everything is done legally. After the new recruits enter the camp, reporters are especially welcome to visit, so that with the help of the public opinion community, the military administration can be promoted smoothly and achieve perfection.</p>

<h3>Elaborate Plots with Guns and Narcotics: A Kidnapping Case Shocked Chengdu – Middle School Student Arrested as Abductor</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 8th] The academic atmosphere in Sichuan Province is increasingly deteriorating, with school-related violent incidents occurring frequently. The Chengdu Garrison Headquarters of Sichuan Province cracked a major middle school student kidnapping case on the 4th in Chengdu, which has now drawn significant public attention.</p>
<p>Student Kidnapped</p>
<p>Deng Guozhang, a resident of Chengdu, once served as a division commander in the Sichuan Army. His son, Deng Yongbao, aged fifteen, is currently a student at Shude Middle School in the city. On the 30th of last month, he was invited by a classmate to see a movie, but he never returned. While Mr. Deng was anxiously searching for him, on the afternoon of the 31st, he suddenly received a letter in Yongbao’s own handwriting, stating that he had been kidnapped by bandits but was safe. The letter requested a ransom of one hundred million yuan, to be delivered by the lotus pond in Zhongzheng Park by dusk the next day. Mr. Deng sent someone as agreed, but they found nothing. On the 2nd, he received another letter, more stern in tone, claiming that the bandits had detected secret police tracking them the previous day. It demanded that he prepare the ransom by 7:00 PM the following day and bring it to the Sun Yat-sen memorial monument in Zhongshan Park. The messenger was to shine a flashlight on the monument's clock three times to signal their arrival, and then negotiations for the ransom could begin for the release of the hostage, otherwise the hostage would be killed.</p>
<p>Plotting to Capture the Bandits</p>
<p>Given the gravity of the situation, Mr. Deng immediately reported the matter to the Provincial Capital Garrison Headquarters for investigation. After a thorough study by the Investigation Division, it was determined that the bandits were audacious enough to demand ransom in the most bustling area of the city, indicating that they were likely members of a major gang. Consequently, the entire Detective Brigade was mobilized, deploying hundreds of machine guns and new-style weapons. That night, hundreds of officers tightly surrounded Jiashan Park, lying in ambush. Mr. Deng was instructed to create a mock ransom of one hundred million yuan using small denomination notes, which was secretly placed near the monument to lure the bandits. As night fell, a short, dark figure was seen sneaking into the park, pacing back and forth by the monument. After repeated hesitation, the figure shined a flashlight on the giant clock at the top of the monument three times. At a signal, the officers emerged from their hiding places and immediately apprehended the bandit. It was discovered that the major bandit was wearing only a student uniform made of coarse gray fabric, carrying a schoolbag and in full student attire. The bandit was only a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old middle school student. Amidst the astonishment of the crowd, the bandit was taken into custody for interrogation. The bandit stubbornly refused to reveal the truth, only stating, "I am a homeless wanderer, without a livelihood, unable to attend school, and was forced to resort to this desperate measure. Now that things have come to this, I beg for execution as punishment." Subsequently, after persuasive encouragement from Commander Yan of the police division, the bandit finally confessed to being Bao Yulin, a student in the junior high division of Mingzhang Middle School, and that the hostage was being held at Jing'an Villa (the most luxurious hotel in Chengdu). That midnight, the division dispatched several officers to search the hotel. They successfully rescued the victim, Deng Yongbao, and apprehended another innocent-looking young student bandit who was guarding the hostage. This student, only thirteen or fourteen years old, was Bao Yulin's younger brother, Bao Yuzhi.</p>
<p>Strange Arrangement</p>
<p>After the entire case was solved, the police division conducted a thorough investigation. According to the testimonies of the three individuals, the details are as follows: The Bao brothers are both from Zhejiang. They came to Sichuan as refugees with their parents during the Anti-Japanese War. Their parents passed away years ago, and they have been wandering in Chengdu ever since. Deng and the Bao brothers were classmates at Mingzhang Middle School last year, but they had not been in contact for half a year. On the 29th, Bao Yulin suddenly visited Deng, falsely claiming that his family had wired fifty million yuan to Chengdu and asked Deng to deposit it in a reliable bank on his behalf. The next day, he invited Deng to the Rongguang Theater to see the movie "A Great Detective of Dragon and Tiger." After the movie, he invited Deng to his room at Jing'an Villa. As soon as they entered the room, Bao Yuzhi suddenly emerged from behind the door, holding a gun in one hand to prevent Deng from shouting, and a handkerchief soaked with "chloroform" in the other hand. Deng was rendered unconscious for some time. Upon regaining consciousness, he was forced to write a ransom note, ultimately leading to his capture.</p>
<p>Various Blueprints</p>
<p>During the search of the Bao brothers' room, the police found a handgun, a bottle of "chloroform," several detective novels, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Con Tricks." It is alleged that these served as blueprints for the young bandits to orchestrate this elaborate kidnapping case.</p>
<p>After the case was revealed, the public believed that it was caused by the decline in academic atmosphere and the failure of social education, launching a united attack on the education authorities. At the same time, the police division faced a thorny issue in sentencing these juvenile offenders, and they may be transferred to the court for handling. Another account suggests that the victim, Deng Yongbao, had a very poor reputation in terms of character and academics, and it is possible that he colluded in his own kidnapping. However, the Deng family and the police division have firmly denied this.</p>

<h3>Students Returning from England – After Completing Studies</h3>

<p>Dr. Sun</p>
<p>A graduate of the West China University Medical School, which relocated to Chengdu. The teachers he worked under during his two years in England were leaders among British surgeons.

There is no lack of future Chinese leaders among them. They have received good training and will assist in the reconstruction of China.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Confusion Among Needy Students – Li Ximou Makes a Statement – Association of Needy Students Found to Be an Illegal Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recently, an organization calling itself the "Association of Needy Students" has been releasing news in the newspapers. Our reporter inquired about this with Li Ximou, director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, who made the following statement: "The Bureau has only seen the name 'Association of Needy Students' in the newspapers. After a thorough investigation, no such organization exists among needy students in this city who have received uniform scholarships or free schooling. The Bureau of Social Affairs has also not seen this organization apply for registration. It is clear that this is an illegal organization of a few individuals with ulterior motives. As for the association's claim that elementary school tuition fees will reach over 2.5 million yuan next week, this is even more of a fabrication, intended to create confusion. Because private school fees have not yet been determined, the Bureau is confident that the school authorities will take into account the burden on parents and set reasonable figures. As for the 25% free quota in each school, this was decided by the Municipal Council and has been accepted and implemented by all schools. It has been included in the schools' total income and will not affect teachers' salaries, so there is no need for further changes. The uniform scholarship is jointly donated by enthusiastic members of society and will be increased as the actual amount received increases. There is no need for needy students to make additional demands. Needy students in this city who cannot obtain a reduction or exemption can apply for the uniform scholarship. In this way, those who cannot afford tuition fees will be able to receive assistance and will not have to drop out of school. As for the so-called private school teachers not receiving in-kind allowances, this is a regulation of the Executive Yuan that applies throughout the country, and this city cannot make an exception. Moreover, this has nothing to do with needy students. Overall, what the spokesperson of the so-called Association of Needy Students says is mostly sensational slogans that disregard the actual situation and even contradict themselves. We are confident that the honest and poor students in each school will not be confused by them and allow them to achieve their ambitions of manipulation and exploitation."</p>

<p>West China | 393 | 2,083</p>
<p>Huping | 174 | 601</p>

<h3>Basketball League Tonight – Hualian Faces Shantou Geng Again – 7:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium</h3>
<p>The third basketball league will have three Class A matches starting at 5:30 PM today, still held at the gymnasium of the Municipal Gymnasium. Hualian of Class A Group 1 will face the Oil Team again. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Indian vs. Chenbai (Class A2A) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Xiqinglü vs. Jiashen (Class A2B) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Hualian vs. Oil Team (Class A Group 1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>In the match between Chenbai and Indian, both teams have no hope of winning the championship in this group, and both have forfeited once, so their scores are equal. The outcome is irrelevant to the overall situation. It is hoped that both teams will maintain sportsmanship and not prioritize winning or losing. In the second match, Jiashen faces Xiqinglü. Jiashen leads the pack in Class A2B, remaining undefeated. The group championship is within reach. However, with Encas's support, Xiqinglü's tactics are novel and their stamina is abundant. Jiashen must be cautious and go all out if they want to remain undefeated. Jiashen's players are young, strong, and experienced, such as Wang Jieping and Tao Rongshi. They should be able to defeat the opposing soldiers and triumph.</p>
<p>In the final match, the undefeated Hualian of Class A Group 1 will face the Oil Team, starting at 7:30 PM. In the first encounter, the Oil Team was defeated. They are eager for revenge tonight, but their strength is far inferior. It will be difficult for them to compete. The only hope is for the Oil Team to lose by fewer points. Hualian's recent form has been excellent. Since defeating the Da Gong New Army, their training has become more dynamic. They have the ambition to retain the championship throne. Tonight, although their main player Li Zhenzhong has left Shanghai for Hangzhou, the team's lineup is still complete. They can still unleash their power and give the Oil Team a head-on blow.</p>
<p>(Hualian): Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, Ren Xiangcheng, Liu Fushan, Qin Xunze, Zhang Liangxiong, Liang Xueling, Kong Guangyi.</p>
<p>(Shantou): Lin Weicong, Chen Qingjiang, He Lide, Zheng Guifang, Ji Nankang, Ma Canxi, Zhou Bin, Lin Zicheng.</p>

<h3>Record of Shanghai Team's Unprecedented Defeat in the 21st Interport Football Match: Hong Kong Team Uses Three Players to Mark Little Huang Mao; Zhang Banglun's Outstanding Performance Saves Many Dangerous Balls</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] With superhuman speed, skillful coordination, and accurate shooting, the Hong Kong team defeated the Shanghai team 5-1 in the 21st Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match, suffering an unprecedented defeat. Several of the Shanghai team's star players failed to reach their usual level, allowing the Hong Kong team, led by Gausano, to easily win the victory.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team:</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Han Longbo, Qu Yongfu, Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Li, Sun Jinshun, Robert Stoff, Xia Tixian, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team:</p>
<p>Tan Junqian</p>
<p>Gao Shanlong, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai, Flower, Liu Songsheng</p>
<p>Zhu Yongqiang, Keena, Deng Yijie, Zou Wenzhi, He Yingfen</p>
<p>Arrived at the Stadium Half an Hour Before the Match</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune did not favor the Shanghai team. Star player Robert Stoff only arrived in Hong Kong by plane from Shanghai half an hour before the match, rushing to the stadium in a hurry, still out of breath. Of course, a few minutes of practice was not enough. But he still fought hard. Because his reputation was already well known in Hong Kong, he scored two goals for the Shanghai team in the previous match, so this time three major players were assigned to mark him, preventing him from performing to his full potential, otherwise the situation would not have been so bad. Of course, the Hong Kong team played well, but it was also due to the Shanghai team's poor performance.</p>
<p>The match was held at Happy Valley on Tuesday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, with approximately 8,000 spectators. Many friends who could not buy tickets stood on the rooftops and hillsides to watch the game, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>The weather was fine, and the field was slightly muddy after the rain. The Shanghai team, in white jerseys and blue shorts, entered the field first, followed by the Hong Kong team in blue jerseys and white shorts. At 3:30 p.m., the match began with the playing of the British national anthem. The Governor of Hong Kong shook hands with each player, and the referee blew the whistle to start the game.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Misses Golden Opportunity</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team kicked off and invaded the Shanghai team's territory. Wu Qixiang cleared the ball with a long kick, driving back the Hong Kong army. The Shanghai team counterattacked, forcing a corner kick, but without success. In the fourth minute, the Shanghai team had a golden opportunity. The entire team attacked the Hong Kong team's goal, but Fei Chunhua's soft kick went wide to the right, which was a pity. In another attack, Robert Stoff passed to Sun Jinshun, whose iron leg shot was too accurate and landed in Tan Junqian's hands. Two good chances, if successful at the time, would have changed the situation.</p>
<p>After failing to attack twice, the Hong Kong team also began to press forward, while the Shanghai team's coordination gradually became disorganized, even collapsing completely. The Hong Kong team attacked, and the situation became critical. Zhang Banglun rushed out to clear the ball, leaving an empty goal, but Deng Yijie missed the shot.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Scores Two Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>In the fourteenth minute, Zou Wenzhi, the right inside forward of the Hong Kong team, scored with a long shot, flying into the corner of the Shanghai team's net. Zhang Banglun was unable to save it. Five minutes later, the Hong Kong team scored the second goal. Zhang Banglun and Qu Yongfu collided with each other, leaving an empty goal. Deng Yijie, like a horse freed from its reins, scored easily.</p>
<p>Having scored two consecutive goals, the Hong Kong team gained confidence, boosted the entire team, and controlled the entire field. Yan Shixin was warned by the referee for dangerous play. The Shanghai team was penalized with a free kick, but without loss.</p>
<p>Fei Chunhua Finally Scores One Goal</p>
<p>It was not until the thirty-ninth minute that the Shanghai team scored its only precious goal of the game. Wu Qixiang kicked a long ball directly to Xia Tixian, who passed it to Fei Chunhua on the right wing. Little Fei rushed straight to the goal and scored with a low shot. The goal revived the entire team, but it was only a fleeting moment. The Hong Kong team's forwards pressed forward, and Zhang Banglun was overwhelmed. In the first half, the Hong Kong team led 2-1.</p>
<p>Wu Qixiang Penalized with a Penalty Kick</p>
<p>In the second half, the Hong Kong team became even sharper. The Shanghai team's territory was full of enemy cavalry, with fierce attacks. Zou Wenzhi and He Yingfen attacked on the right wing, and the Shanghai team was busy defending, opening a loophole on the left. Keena, the left inside forward of the Hong Kong team, scored the third goal.</p>
<p>Just two minutes later, Wu Qixiang was penalized with a penalty kick, which Zou Wenzhi kicked in, making the score 4-1, and the Shanghai team's situation was dire.</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun's Left Leg Was Injured</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Shanghai team captain Sun Jinshun injured his left leg and had to leave the field. In addition, Old Sun could no longer participate in the matches in Hong Kong. The Shanghai team's occasional attacks were merely embellishments. Robert Stoff got a header, but it did not go in. The Hong Kong team's forwards cooperated beautifully, and center forward Deng Yijie finally scored the fifth goal from eight yards in front of the goal. With five minutes remaining, the spectators were already leaving, expressing great disappointment with the Shanghai team. If it were not for Zhang Banglun's efforts to save dangerous balls, the Shanghai team would have lost by even more. The Shanghai team's performance was very unusual, but the entire team had indeed done its best. The Hong Kong team's speed was too high, making it difficult to cope with.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Brown Sugar Will Be Exported in Large Quantities This Year</h3>
<p>In Taiwan's sugar industry, white sugar is operated by the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corporation. The company also produces brown sugar (赤砂), but the output is not large. Most of the manufacturers in the province are private manufacturers of Taiwan red sugar (brown sugar), which is known for its pure quality. The raw material for sugar production is entirely sugarcane, which is directly produced by new-style machinery. This year's output is about 120,000 dan. In the future, in addition to supplying the province, it will also be exported and sold in large quantities. The Taiwan Provincial Red Sugar Industry Association, in order to determine the name and differentiate it from the brown sugar (赤砂) and green sugar produced by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, has named it "Taiwan Red Sugar". It is reported that the association has asked the Taiwan Provincial Federation of Commerce to forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform sugar merchants to pay attention.</p>

<h3>Intense Competition Between Bulls and Bears: Domestic Stocks Flourish</h3>
<p>Although domestic stocks were weak in the middle of the day due to the heavier burden of interest rates and the exit of bulls from securities firms, the Guangdong firms stopped selling and started buying after 11:30 a.m., reversing the trend and becoming bullish again. In the end, buying and selling competition was fierce, and silver was pulled higher.</p>
<p>The opening was slightly strong. Wing On Cotton Mill appeared at 730 yuan and 761 yuan. Numbers 89, 134, and 154 were immediately delivered after buying in, and numbers 23 and 55 were delivered on a deferred basis, with prices rising to 742 yuan and 767 yuan.

The off-site interest rate was still 3 jiao 1.5 fen and 3 jiao 6 fen, requiring a two-day burden, and the price fell back to a low of 723 yuan and 742 yuan. Numbers 231 and 180 maintained their position at the low price and then turned around. After 11:30 a.m., the Guangdong firms started buying in, with numbers 202 and 155 strongly buying, and numbers 18, 35 also being delivered immediately, and numbers 14 and 8 being delivered on a deferred basis. The buying of number 202 was the most urgent, and the price rose back to a high of 754 yuan and 768 yuan. Numbers 231, 160, 183, 197, and 157 took the opportunity to close out, and the closing price at noon was finally settled at 739 yuan and 760 yuan. The remaining stocks were also mediocre. Only New Kwong, King Fook, and Lum Kum saw some action.

<h3>After the Implementation of the Public Treasury Law, Salt Tax is Directly Deposited into the Treasury</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] It is reported that the Ministry of Finance originally stipulated that the salt tax should be collected first by the purchasing salt people and then calculated daily by the General Affairs Agency in the supervision and operation account set up in the designated bank, and then transferred to the national treasury, which was a temporary measure. Now that the Public Treasury Law has been implemented for some time, the tax payment should be directly paid into the treasury by the taxpayer. It is specially stipulated that merchants should directly deposit the tax into the treasury. The procedure is that the salt affairs agency fills out the payment form in accordance with the law and hands it to the merchant for direct deposit into the treasury, in order to comply with the law.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Trade in 1947</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Ben Geng</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Foreign trade is a very important part of the overall economic problem of the United Kingdom. Now let us take a look at the situation of British foreign trade in 1947:</p>
<p>The following figures represent foreign trade in 1947 and its comparison with 1938 (pre-war) and 1946. (Unit: thousands of pounds).</p>
<p>Year　Imports　Exports of Domestic Goods　Re-exports of Imported Goods　Trade Deficit</p>
<p>1938　919,509　470,753　61,323　587,229</p>
<p>1946　1,501,030　914,699　50,269　336,062</p>
<p>1947　1,787,471　1,157,083　59,267　591,221</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has always been a country with a trade deficit in foreign trade. According to statistics, the export figure for 1947 was the highest since 1920, and two and a half times that of 1938. However, this is in terms of the value of the pound. In reality, due to rising prices, the quantity of exported goods did not increase as much. Details of the current price increases have not yet been released. However, it is estimated that the quantity of exports in 1947 was approximately 108 percent of the quantity in 1938. In other words, the increase was less than one-tenth. The goal of the United Kingdom is to increase the quantity of exports to 140 percent of that of 1938, because this is necessary for the United Kingdom to have a sufficient amount of imports to improve the people's living standards. As can be seen from the situation in 1947, the situation in each quarter was not the same, approximately as follows: (Unit: thousands of pounds)</p>
<p>Quarter　Imports　Exports of Domestic Goods　Re-exports of Imported Goods　Trade Deficit</p>
<p>1st Quarter　363,650　249,659　18,197　95,794</p>
<p>2nd Quarter　455,518　264,876　17,770　172,872</p>
<p>3rd Quarter　517,398　302,449　21,311　203,818</p>
<p>4th Quarter　450,905　320,099　12,069　28,737</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the trade deficit in the last quarter of these four quarters showed a decreasing trend. According to statistics, the quantity of exports in the fourth quarter of 1946 was 111 percent of that of 1938, falling to 101 percent in the first quarter of 1947, 102 percent in the second quarter, 114 percent in the third quarter, and 117 percent in the fourth quarter. In other words, although the quantity of exports for the entire year of 1947 was only 108 percent of that of 1938, the main reason was that the figures for the first and second quarters were too low. The particularly low figures for the first quarter are generally said to be related to the particularly cold weather in the United Kingdom in the first three months of 1947, as well as the coal shortage, which affected transportation, thus affecting exports for the entire year.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>As for the types and amounts of imported and exported goods, it is also worth taking a look. First, let us look at the situation of imported goods in 1947 and its comparison with 1938 and 1946. (Unit: thousands of pounds)</p>
<p>Type of Goods　1938　1946　1947</p>
<p>Food, Tobacco, and Beverages　430,117　637,478　805,427</p>
<p>Raw Materials and Unfinished Products　248,213　390,218　559,823</p>
<p>Finished Products and Semi-Finished Products　233,522　245,271　399,424</p>
<p>Animals Not Used as Food　3,318　7,145　7,726</p>
<p>Parcel Post Imports　4,339　20,918　15,071</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the bulk of the United Kingdom's imported goods is food, tobacco, and beverages, which is the main reason why the UK's trade deficit problem is difficult to solve. Food is an absolute necessity, but judging from the situation in each quarter of 1947, the import of food, tobacco, and beverages also showed a decreasing trend. The average monthly import in the first quarter was 61,557,000 pounds, in the second quarter it was 71,321,000 pounds, in the third quarter it was 76,202,000 pounds, but in the fourth quarter it decreased to 59,395,000 pounds. (Note: The above figures for each quarter are the average monthly import figures for food, tobacco, and beverages in each quarter.)</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The situation of exported goods is as follows: (Unit: thousands of pounds)</p>
<p>Type of Goods　1938　1946　1947</p>
<p>Food, Beverages, and Tobacco　35,803　63,684　64,725</p>
<p>Raw Materials and Unfinished Products　56,921　33,013　34,207</p>
<p>Finished Products and Semi-Finished Products　365,245　789,110　998,877</p>
<p>Animals Not Used as Food　679　3,758　3,574</p>
<p>Parcel Post Exports　12,017　25,134　35,700</p>
<p>The situation of exports is the opposite of that of imports. Exports are mainly finished products and semi-finished products, while the quantities of exports in the first item (food, beverages, and tobacco) and the second item (raw materials and unfinished products) are not important in comparison. This situation also shows that the United Kingdom is an industrial country. However, it is not difficult to imagine the difficult situation of an industrial country whose people's living standards have already been raised to a very high level and which lacks food. From the above table, we can also see that the solution to the UK's economic problems still requires effort. (Note: The figures in this article are based on the Board of Trade Journal, Volume 154, Number 2666, published by the British Board of Trade on January 24 of this year. What is reported in this article is the value of imports and exports. Under the circumstances of frequent changes in prices, the quantity of imports and exports is very important. Once the authorities publish it, another report will be made.) (London, night of January 27, 1948.)</p>

<h3>On the Word "Xiu" in Yi Inscriptions</h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>In the spring of the thirty-sixth year, Yang Yufu's "Explanation of Poems on Yang Wang's Xiu" was published in the thirteenth issue of the Wen Shi Zhou Kan of Ta Kung Pao. Based on the usage of the word "xiu" in bronze inscriptions, it corrected Deng Jian's interpretation of "xiu" as beauty and the misinterpretations of bronze inscription scholars since the Song Dynasty. He said that Zheng Kangcheng's interpretation of the word "xiu" as beauty was "superficial and irrelevant," and he interpreted it as "bestowed." "Dui Yang Wang Xiu" means "to answer and praise the King's bestowal." In ancient pronunciation, "xiu" is the same as "hao," and "hao" also means "bestowed." He also used five evidences based on bronze inscriptions to prove that "xiu" should be interpreted as "bestowed."</p>
<p>I think Mr. Yang's conclusion is a bit too hasty. The word "xiu" can certainly be interpreted as "bestowed" in some places, but this interpretation cannot be used everywhere. The meaning of a word has multiple aspects. The problem with general philologists is that they often regard the meanings of words as independent and rigid, without integrating them. The same word "hao" is interpreted as "beautiful" or as "bestowed," as if there is no connection between them. Mr. Yang said:</p>
<p>"Xiu" should be read as "hao." The "Daming" of the Xiaoya in the Book of Poetry says, "Hao is upright," and Deng Jian says, "Hao is like 'yu' (to give)." The seventh year of Duke Zhao in the Zuo Zhuan says, "Hao to greatly yield," which means to bribe with a great yield. The "Nei Zai" of the Zhou Li Tianguan says, "Whenever the king bestows meat preserves, the Nei Zai share it." "Hao bestowed" is used together, so "hao" also means "bestowed." Zheng's note, "what the king favors and bestows," is wrong.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's citation of the Book of Poetry is too much of a selective interpretation. The fourth chapter of "Xiaoming" says, "Be respectfully diligent in your position, and uprightness is given." The fifth chapter says, "Be respectfully diligent in your position, and 'hao' is upright." We can easily understand why Deng Kangcheng said "'hao' is like 'yu'," because the meaning of these two chapters is similar. If it were not for the rhyme, the fifth chapter could also say "uprightness is 'hao'," and the sentence structure would be the same. In philology, "A is like B" means that the meanings of A and B are similar, but it cannot be said that A is B. Even if the word "hao" can be interpreted as "yu," here it is only the "yu" of "dangyu" (to participate) and "xuyu" (to allow), not the "yu" of "bestowed." The "Zheng Min" of the Daya says, "The people hold to their norms, and 'hao' is virtue," which has exactly the same sentence structure as "'hao' is upright." This simply means "to be pleased with," and is only similar in meaning to the "yu" of "dangyu" and "xuyu," but it cannot be said that "hao" is "yu."</p>
<p>It is acceptable to interpret the "hao" of "hao to greatly yield" as "bribe," and it is also acceptable to interpret "hao" as "bestowed" because the "li hao bestowed" is used together. But we should not reject other meanings of the word "hao." The "hao" of "hao to greatly yield" still contains the meaning of "to rejoice in and form good relations." The Zhou Li often uses "hao bestowed" together, and the Nei Fu also uses the three words "hao bestowed yu" (give) together, but they still have their own distinctions. The Wai Fu says, "The wealth used for the bestowal of yu," but does not mention "hao." The Taizai says, "The models for 'hao' usage," and Zheng Xuan notes, "Gifts for banquets and good relations," which shows that "hao" is not usually the same as giving. The Nei Zai notes, "Hao bestowed, what the king favors and bestows," which is not wrong, except that it combines the two words "hao bestowed" into one meaning.</p>
<p>The ancient pronunciation of the word "xiu" was similar to the word "hao," and they have the same etymological origin. Mr. Yang's reading of "xiu" as "hao" is not a problem in itself. The problem is that the word "xiu" should not be limited to the meaning of "bestowed." Because from our point of view, the interpretation of "xiu" as "beauty" is the same as the interpretation of "hao" as "beauty."</p>
<p>Mr. Yang cited many evidences from bronze inscriptions, such as the Xiao Chen Yi, which says, "Chasing Uncle bestows upon Xiao Chen three strings of cowries, three families of Chen, in response to this bestowal." He said that the word "xiu" above can only be interpreted as "bestowed," and then said, "If the following 'dui jue xiu' is interpreted as 'in response to this beauty,' wouldn't it be ridiculous?" There is also the Xiao You: "The king bestowed fifty strings of cowries upon the duke, and the duke bestowed twenty strings of King Xiu's cowries upon his son Shezi Xiao." This is dividing twenty strings of cowries to benefit Xiao from the fifty strings of cowries that the king bestowed. Above it says "bestowed," and below it says "xiu." There is also the Hao Shu Lü Zhong, "The Son of Heaven bestowed much Lü's xiu," and "The Son of Heaven bestowed much chase's xiu." "Bestowed" is a verb, and "xiu" is a noun. There is also the Da Bao Yi, "The king gives the Da Bao xiu and remaining land," and Bian Shi Yi, "Xiu bestows Bian Shi cowries." "Bestowed xiu" is used together, and "xiu bestowed" is used together. We acknowledge that in these evidences, the meanings of "xiu" and "bestowed" are similar.</p>
<p>But Mr. Yang is too rigid. He says:</p>
<p>Examining the phrase "dui yang wang xiu" in bronze inscriptions, it must be the reason for the creation of the vessel. The ruler rewards his subordinates, and the subordinates create vessels to record the event as glory. This is what is meant by "praising the ruler's bestowal." If it is said "praise the ruler's beauty," rewarding subordinates is a common thing for a ruler. What beauty is there to speak of? This is judging from the principles of things, and it can be known that it must not be so.</p>
<p>We really don't understand why he separates "glory" and "beauty" so clearly. From the ruler's point of view, the ruler's reward to his subordinates may be a common occurrence, but from the point of view of the subordinate who receives the reward, it should be glory, that is, the ruler's good intentions. Therefore, he should praise his "beauty." This is very common and easy to explain. Mr. Yang simply regards the words "xiu" and "hao" as rigid, and can only interpret them as "bestowed," so he also regards praising the beauty of the ruler as only general virtues and cannot interpret it as specifically targeting someone's good intentions.</p>
<p>From the point of view of philology, besides the meaning of "rest and stop," the Erya Shigou interprets "xiu" as "beauty," Shiyan interprets it as "celebration," and Guangya Shigou interprets it as "joy." It has always been interpreted only as "beautiful" and "joyful." Even from the point of view of bronze inscriptions, the word "xiu" is not only used as "bestowed." There are some places where it should still be interpreted as "beauty," and "dui yang wang xiu" is also like this. Before discussing this point, we must also involve another important issue.</p>
<p>There is a 卣 in the bronze ware, with the inscription "Xiu Wang bestowed three Lü on Xiao Father, and used it to make his precious zunyi." There are also three ding with similar inscriptions. Guo Moruo wrote in the Da Xi of Liang Zhou Jinwenci that "This is a vessel of King Xiao's time. Xiu Wang is King Xiao. In ancient times, xiu and xiao were homophones." At that time, a large number of people believed this view. For example, Mr. Wu Qichang based on the "Xiaoyang ye" of Shiming Shiyanyu and the "Xiuyang ye" of the Yujizao Zhengyi of the Book of Rites to support Guo's view. On the Chronological Table of Bronze Inscriptions, it is said that "Guo Jun proposed that Xiu Wang was King Xiao. Qichang repeatedly considered it and could not change his theory in the end, so he followed it and elaborated on it to strengthen his proof." But I think it is very dangerous to rely solely on the similarity of sounds without other evidence. I think the "xiu" of Xiu Wang is only a verb, not a personal name, and I have discussed it with Mr. Guo. Later, Guo Guang Sheng's revised edition of the Da Xi Kao Shi said under the Zhao You:</p>
<p>"Xiu Wang is King Xiao, the younger brother of King Yi. In ancient times, xiu and xiao were homophones. King Xiao was originally called Xiu. Later, in the legend, he was transformed into Xiao. The Xiao Father Yi and the Yi Father Ding also saw "Xiu Wang." Tang Lan said, "Xiu is a verb. The Zhao Gao says, "Now Xiu Wang does not dare to lag behind, using concern and fear for the people," which can prove it. There are many examples of this in ancient times, such as saying "The Emperor of Lu's command," where Lu is also a verb. To praise the Emperor or the King of Lu Xiu, and call him "Xiu Wang" or "The Emperor of Lu," the meaning is the same. The Xian Fei Yi says, "Xian Fei Min Yang Bo Mu Father Xiu, saying: Xiu Bo Wu Mu Su Xian Bo Shi," Xiu Bo is also like Xiu Wang." Now, according to the two vessels alone, Tang's theory is also acceptable. I also suspected that Xiu was an adjective at first, so in the article on the origin of posthumous titles, all the vessels that mentioned "Xiu Wang" were not referred to. Now that this vessel is read, the verb adjective theory cannot be applied. If it is read as "Zhao Jinqi's affairs, running to serve the Emperor, Xiu," it seems to be acceptable, but the Fangyan Qi Jin already has Cheng, and the logic is difficult to articulate, so this reading cannot be applied. In the Zhao Gao, I still think it is appropriate to follow the old reading and interrupt the sentence with "now Xiu," and the following "The King has a successful command to govern the people, now Xiu, the King first served the Yin Royal affairs, similar to my Zhou Royal affairs" is also the same. Now Xiu refers to the good fortune given by Heaven. The "Xiu Bo" of Xian Fei is also the name of Bo Qun Fu, probably because Xiu Wang is called Xiu, and Bo Qun Fu is also called Xiu."</p>
<p>Guo Xianwang first acknowledged that my theory was acceptable, only because the sentence of Zhao Gao was not applicable to verbs or adjectives, so he still said that "Xiu Wang" was King Xiao. In fact, the Zhao Gao says, "Xiu Wang personally destroyed the envoy to reward Bi Tu, fifty li in the square." Apart from the one point of sending people to reward from the place of Zi Gu, what is the difference in grammar between Xiu Wang rewarding Bi Tu fifty li in the square and "Xiu Wang bestowed three Lü on Xiao Father" or "Xiu Wang bestowed cowries on Yi Father." If those two inscriptions can be understood, then Zhao You cannot but be applicable. As for saying that "Xiu Bo" is the name of Bo Qun Fu, it feels even more far-fetched.</p>
<p>In the years 1937 and 1938, a new bronze vessel was unearthed, the Mu Gong Ding, and the inscription says:</p>
<p>Mu Gong created the Yin Gu ancestral temple in Mu Lin. In the sixth month, the Yi Mao after the Ji Sheng Ba, the Heaven King does not forget Mu Gong's holy spirit and bright virtue. Serving the former kings, each in the Yin Gu ancestral temple Yao Lin. The King does not offend Yin Gu Li, bestowing jade five grades, horses four pairs. Bow down and kowtow, to praise the Heaven King's Xiu, use to create reality.</p>
<p>"'Xiu Tian Jun Fu Wang Mu Gong' is praising the Heaven King for not forgetting Mu Gong." Xiu is a verb, and my theory is fully explained here. Praising Wang Xiu can become "Xiu Wang," Zhao Yang Bo Xiu can become "Xiu Bo," and praising Heaven King Xiu can become "Xiu Heaven King." Then, Xiu Wang will never be a personal name, and will never be King Xiao.</p>
<p>From this issue, we know that "Xiu Wang" is converted from the sentence structure of praising Wang Xiu. Then, the meaning of the word Xiu should not be limited to bestowal. Because praising Wang's bestowal can still be barely understood, if "Xiu Zheng bestowal" is interpreted as bestowing King bestowal, it would not be logical. The Xiu You says, "Zhao does not dare offend Wang Xiu Yi," hence the linked text is the King's good intentions and Yi number. It is also incomprehensible to interpret Xiu as bestowal here.</p>
<p>The root meaning of Xiu Xue is beauty, not bestowal. However, bestowal is always a good intention, so the word Xiu is used as good intention bestowal, and over time, it is simply used to explain bestowal. The word Ming itself does not have the meaning of bestowal, but it is often used in this way in ancient books and ancient vessels, which is an excellent example.</p>
<p>Therefore, "dui jue xiu" in Xiao Chen Yi may as well be "dui jue mei" (in response to this beauty), which is not ridiculous. "Dui Yang Wang Xiu" in the Book of Poetry may as well be "dui yang wang mei" (in response to the King's beauty), and is not "superficial and irrelevant." Mr. Yang's evaluation is prejudiced and has nothing to do with textual research itself. In our research on philology, we must focus on the entirety of word meanings and pay attention to their development, and not be guided by superficial meanings. Mr. Yang and others proved from bronze inscriptions that the word "xiu" can be interpreted as bestowal, which is a very good discovery, but we must clearly recognize that this is only a special extended meaning. If we rashly use this philology on everything that can be interpreted as "beauty" and try to correct them, it will become "one slip in a thousand thoughts."</p>
<h3>The Native Place of Cao Xueqin's Family</h3>
<p>— Hu Shih</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Xiangkui sent a letter from Shandong University asking whether the author of Dream of the Red Chamber, Cao Xueqin's family, was from Fengrun County, Hebei Province. Mr. Yang quoted this paragraph from an article by Mr. Ping Zong entitled "Cao Xueqin's Native Place" published in the Qingdao Min Yan Wan Bao (December 23):</p>
<p>"When the Qing Dynasty entered the Pass in the early days, most of the Han people from Liaodong who surrendered were assigned to the Han military banner. Cao Xueqin, the author of Dream of the Red Chamber, was one of them. The Imperial Dynasty General History and the General Genealogy of the Eight Banners both say that they lived in Shenyang for generations, but they do not know that the Cao family's original native place was Fengrun County, Hebei. You Tong's Gengen Qi Wenji "Song Ci Poetry Draft Preface" has "Cao Zi Li Xuan, a native of Fengrun," etc. According to Li Xuan's name Yin, Zi Ziqing, is Xueqin's grandfather. From this, it can be seen that Xueqin's ancestors were originally from Fengrun. His name Shenyang is probably a registered residence..."</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Xiangkui is from Fengrun, so he is very interested in this issue. He said in his letter: "Fengrun had four major surnames in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, namely Gu, Lu, Cao, and Chen. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Manchu people entered the Pass, and Fengrun was a must-pass place. Many people were captured. The Cao family may have been captured at this time and became bondservants, and then planted Shenyang people... There are also Duanfang who were originally from Fengrun in the Han military banner and said to be from the Northeast. Duanfang's surname is Tao, and he is from the north of Fengrun city. Later, he was in the banner, so he was mistakenly called Shenyang. The Cao family may also be like this."</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Wang Chongmin kindly borrowed You Tong's "Gengen Qi Juan" from the Peking Library on my behalf. I checked the "Song Ci Poetry Draft Preface" and realized that Mr. Ping Zong had misread this text. The preface did not say "Cao Zi Li Xuan, a native of Fengrun." The original text is:</p>
<p>"Cao Zi Li Xuan and I are friends of different ages. His poems are desolate and melancholy, forming his own family. People sent his brother Chonggu to travel to Wumen, and he was able to read his Song Ci Poetry Draft. It is true that the brothers are good at the arena, and they are all the later strengths of Yecheng... I have already made friends with Chonggu, knowing that he is a native of Fengrun. Fengrun is a strong county in Jingji... I once served as Si Li in his territory... and was crowned as the Fifth Grand Historian and received education... I heard that the Grand Historian was tired of putting Minglu, and served as a large prefect, one in Huizhou, two in Fengxiang, and three</p>
<p>In Guangxin. And Chonggu was in Zishe, often following him with a sword..."</p>
<p>This does not say that Cao Yin (Li Xuan) is from Fengrun, but only that a Cao Chonggu is from Fengrun County and is the son of Cao Guan Wu Taishi. The preface says "Now Zhi Nai Brother Chonggu has traveled to Wumen," which can only be interpreted as "Cao Li Xuan introduced his brother Chonggu to visit Suzhou." It said "The brothers are good at the arena, and they are all the later strengths of Yecheng," which is a general allusion to the Cao family, and does not mean that they are really from the same family. Therefore, You Tong, Cao Yin's "friend of different ages," did not know the native place of this "elder brother" until he "made friends with Chonggu" and "knew that he was from Fengrun."</p>
<p>That "Guan Wu Taishi" is Cao Dingwang, who was a Jinshi in the sixteenth year of Shunzhi, was selected for the Hanlin Academy, and served as a prefect for three terms. The Jinshi title record says that he is from Fengrun County, Shuntian Prefecture. Chonggu is his son and is certainly not Cao Yin's brother. Cao Yin's father was called Cao Xi, who was born as a bondservant and served as the Jiangning Weaving Envoy for twenty-two years. Cao Yin did not have an elder brother, only a younger brother, Ziyou, who is also mentioned in You Tong's "Cao Tai Furen Sixty Shou Xu" and "Dong Ting Fu." His family tree does not have a person who became a Jinshi or a Hanlin academician. According to Volume 74 of the General Genealogy of the Eight Banners, Cao Yin's great-grandfather Cao Xiyuan "lived in the Shenyang area for generations, and there is no record of the year he came to surrender." You Tong wrote the preface in the year Bingzi of Kangxi Thirty-five (1696 AD). Counting up to Yin's great-grandfather, it should have been before the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty. We can only say that Cao Xueqin's family history, counting back six generations, cannot be considered Fengrun County people. (Cao family genealogy quoted from Hu Shih Wen Cun Volume 3, page 844) Whether Cao Xiyuan went from Fengrun is something we cannot determine now. But this preface by You Tong is not enough to prove that his family is from Fengrun, only that Cao Yin once recognized the Fengrun poet Cao Chonggu as a brother of the same family.</p>
<p>In the future, Mr. Yang Xiangkui may be able to seek out the poems or genealogy of the Cao family in Fengrun from this clue, which may help answer this question.</p>
<h3>"Two-Sided Arguments" of the Old Faction of the Northern Song Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Guo Guangming</p>
<p>— Concurrently Examining Sima Guang's Initial Advocacy of the Substitute Labor Law —</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, the laws and institutions established in the early years of the Northern Song Dynasty had already produced many malpractices. Especially after being invaded by Western Xia, the Song Dynasty concentrated the nation's manpower and material resources to cope with the situation, yet still often felt that its ability to resist was insufficient. At this time, not only were military weaknesses fully exposed, but weaknesses in civil administration and finance also became fully apparent. Fan Zhongyan carried out a new policy during the Qingli years (1043-1044) but failed. Subsequently, the general trend forced Wang Anshi's reform during the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong (1068-1077).</p>
<p>After Fan Zhongyan's failure and before Wang Anshi came to power, most scholars and officials concerned about politics still believed that political economy and military affairs should be reformed at that time. For example, Su Shi, who was greatly known for his literary talent at that time, believed that "if you want to bring the world to great governance," there must be a reform that "greatly corrects the customs of the world." In the late years of Renzong, he wrote a book to offer advice, discussing the grand plan of "pacifying the people, enriching wealth, and training soldiers," and suggested "equalizing households, comparing taxes, teaching battle and defense, establishing military systems, training military strength, and advocating courage." He also made specific plans to control Western Xia and Khitan, and even exaggerately said: "If you use my words, you can even take Khitan in the north." In Zhu Xi's words, he really looked like he "was desperate to come out to tidy up the corruption."</p>
<p>After Emperor Shenzong ascended the throne, he was determined to enrich the country and strengthen the army. Wang Anshi came out to take on the important task of changing the laws and systems, regarding financial management as the primary task. He created various new laws for this purpose, disregarding everything and forcefully implementing them. However, "reforming abuses in long-term peace," long-standing habits were difficult to change suddenly. Therefore, when the new laws were implemented, countless disputes and resistance were aroused in society, especially among scholars and officials. At this time, those who had previously advocated reform, and even some people who had participated in the initial work of Wang Anshi's reform, all turned back and retreated, changing or even abandoning their original opinions. Taking Su Shi as an example again, he saw that the Green Sprouts Law caused many disturbances, so he no longer talked about financial management; seeing Li Xian's failure in using troops against Western Xia, he no longer talked about raising troops. He completely reversed his previous arguments, and even said that he was afraid of causing resentment for selecting redundant soldiers, and thought it unnecessary.</p>
<p>In Zhu Zi's Classified Conversations, there are several articles recording Zhu Xi's criticism of Su Shi's contradictory arguments before and after. One article concludes: "He clearly has two-sided arguments."</p>
<p>In fact, among the so-called Old Party, Su Shi was not the only one who "clearly had two-sided arguments." It was only because Zhu Xi had no respect for Su Shi's character that he specifically criticized him. For example, in Zhu Zi's Classified Conversations, there are two other records:</p>
<p>"Lv's Family Tradition records that Duke Jing (Wang Anshi) and Duke Shen (Lv Gongzhu) were extremely friendly at that time, and the new laws were all discussed together, so Duke Shen was very much expected to help when implementing the new laws. Mingdao (Cheng Hao) was also used as the regulations division, all in the hope of the help of the sages. At that time, one can imagine his good intentions. Later, he completely betrayed his original intentions, so the sages all did not follow him."</p>
<p>"When the new law was implemented, the dukes actually conspired together, even Mr. Mingdao did not think it was wrong. Because at that time, it was also the time to change the times. However, later, people's feelings were turbulent, and Mingdao began to advise him that things that go against people's feelings should not be done. And when Wang's vigorously implemented it despite public opinion, Duke Nuo began to retreat and disperse."</p>
<p>Zhu Xi's two remarks are not very fair, because he is too partial to Cheng and Lv in the old faction. He believed that the division of the new and old parties was due to Wang Anshi "completely betraying his original intentions later." However, the facts told us the opposite. Since Wang Anshi entered the government and created new laws, his style and intentions have truly achieved the point of "consistent from beginning to end." What he did later was to implement his "original intentions" of reform. It may be that he failed to fully realize his "original intentions" because of various obstacles. It is truly slander to say that he "completely betrayed his original intentions." Zhu Xi clearly said that "the implementation of the new law was actually conspired by the dukes together," and Cheng Hao's participation in the farmland water conservancy law in the implementation of the new law, as one of the eight envoys sent to various places at that time, is even a well-known fact. Lv Gongzhu had not only discussed the new law with Wang Anshi, but Sima Guang's diary recorded that Guang had discussed with Emperor Shenzong in person in April of the third year of Xining about Lv Gongzhu's reversals:</p>
<p>"Lv Gongzhu is indeed guilty, but not today. In the past, the imperial court entrusted Gongzhu with the responsibility of recommending officials from the Taiwan, but he recommended all the people from the regulations division, and they supported each other, making it so rampant. Then, he was forced by public opinion to say that it was wrong. This is what can be condemned." (According to the Record of Famous Officials' Words and Deeds) This shows that Lv was originally a person who vigorously supported the implementation of the new law at the beginning, and it was later that he "was forced by public opinion" that he changed his attitude again.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the reason why the relationship between Cheng and Lv and Wang Anshi deteriorated later was not Anshi's fault at all, but Cheng and Lv were afraid of "the turbulence of people's feelings" and "forced by public opinion," and then "completely betrayed their original intentions," completely betrayed the new law and Wang Anshi. So, are these two people not also "clearly have two-sided arguments"?</p>
<p>Other figures in the old faction, such as Han Qi and Fu Bi, were all people who started reform with Fan Zhongyan during the Qingli years. After that reform failed, they continued to point out the shortcomings of the tax system and the foreign peace and war policies at that time, as well as the need for improvement. However, when Wang Anshi implemented the new law, they joined forces to undermine it. Fu Bi even advised Emperor Shenzong of Song to "not mention military affairs for twenty years." Compared with the spirit of courage in the past, it is truly like two different people. Ye Shi of the Southern Song Dynasty said in his preface to the Xixue Jiyan:</p>
<p>"Ouyang Xiu said that Bi was intelligent and decisive, which was when he first held power, but it was not the case after he became prime minister. When Bi first held power, his intention to change was greater than Fan and Han. When he became prime minister, he thought it was right to stick to everything and not do anything. Even if Qi slightly changed, he could not follow it. The ancient virtuous prime ministers became more enlightened due to worries and difficulties, such as the Duke of Zhou; Bi became more faint due to worries and difficulties, and he still wanted to think of himself as virtuous, which I don't know."</p>
<p>If Zhu Xi's words are used, Han Qi and Fu Bi are of course "clearly have two-sided arguments."</p>
<p>Sima Guang, who opposed the new law the most and was later regarded as the leader of the old faction, also had "two-sided arguments." The most important items in the new law were the Green Sprouts Law and the Substitute Labor Law. When these two new laws were implemented, Sima Guang did his best to oppose them. After Emperor Shenzong died and Emperor Zhezong ascended the throne, Sima Guang took power, and these two laws, like all other new laws, were abolished by Sima Guang in turn. Before abolishing them, he called the Green Sprouts, Exemption, and Military Officer three new laws and the Western Xia invasion as the four evils, and said to others: "If the four evils are not eliminated, I will not rest in peace." It can be seen the extent of his hatred for these new laws. However, if we trace the history of the Substitute Labor Law, we can know that Sima Guang had already made this proposal several years before Wang Anshi created the Substitute Labor Law.</p>
<p>Volume 12 of the Wenxian Tongkao, Examination of Duties and Services 1, records:</p>
<p>"During the time of Emperor Yingzong, the admonishing official Sima Guang said: Since the establishment of the township household officers, the people have become more and more poor and exhausted, and dare not make a living. The rich are not as good as the poor, and the poor dare not seek wealth. I have traveled in villages and seen the insignificance of farmers' living tools and asked the reason, and they all said, "I dare not do it. Now, if I want to plant more mulberry trees, keep more cattle, store two years of food, and store ten bolts of silk, the neighbors will already regard me as a wealthy family and point out that I am an officer, let alone dare to increase fields and repair houses?"…"</p>
<p>"I think: Farmers should not be involved in anything other than rent and taxes. Officers should be recruited to do it, and they should be compensated with preferential treatment. If it is not enough, it should be done by the upper households in the city. The people in the city send convoys, manage warehouses, and do not cost two or three, but the farmers often cost eight or nine. Why? The nature of the wise and foolish is different."</p>
<p>After these two passages, Ma Duanlin attached an annotation:</p>
<p>"According to Duke Wen, this memorial was spoken during the time of Emperor Yingzong. The so-called recruiting people to fill the officers is the law of Xining. However, since it is called recruiting, there must be something to reward it. If this money does not come from the government, the people who should serve should pay it, then the assistance money is inevitable. Why did the scholars who discussed this matter at that time repeatedly disagree?"</p>
<p>We can analyze Ma Duanlin's simple annotation into three points:</p>
<p>1. During the time of Emperor Yingzong, Sima Guang had already suggested "recruiting people to fill the officers."</p>
<p>2. The method proposed by Sima Guang is actually equivalent to the assistance (recruitment) law implemented by Wang Anshi later.</p>
<p>3. It is a strange thing that Sima Guang opposed the assistance law implemented by Wang Anshi.</p>
<p>At this point, we can only quote Zhu Xi's words to explain: It is because Sima Guang had already "completely betrayed his original intentions" during the time of Xining, so he could not help but "have two-sided arguments."</p>
<p>The two passages of Sima Guang quoted in the Tongkao are actually not in the same memorial. Now, after checking, the first passage quoted by him is a passage from Sima Guang's "Notes on Officers," which can be found in Volume 38 of the Collection of Duke Sima Wenzheng. The second passage he quoted, "I think," and the following words, are a passage from Sima Guang's "Memorial on Wealth and Profit," which can be found in Volume 23 of the Collection of Duke Sima Wenzheng. Li Tao's Continued Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance, Volume 196, lists Sima Guang's "Memorial on Wealth and Profit" on the first day of May in the seventh year of Jiayou of Emperor Renzong (1062), which is two years earlier than the time mentioned in the Tongkao. It is only eight or nine years away from Wang Anshi's implementation of the Substitute Labor Law. Sima Guang should not have forgotten the passage in his "Memorial on Wealth and Profit," but he "completely betrayed his original intentions" and desperately opposed the Substitute Labor Law.

<h3>Historical Discussion on Nanzhao (3)</h3>
<p>— Xiang Da</p>
<p>— Various Books Recording Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty —</p>
<p>This should be Hua Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue, so it records his own experiences. The Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era 937 Jia Yu article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording the Jia fish of Bing Cave in Yazhou; 867 Tea article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording Mengshan tea in Mingshan County; 839 Rice article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording rice in Rongjing County, Yazhou; 942 Clam article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording women of Xin'an barbarians; 980 Radish article quotes Yunnan Ji, recording Zhuge vegetables produced in the boundary of Xuizhou; 958 Tuo article quotes Yunnan Ji, 974 Sugarcane article quotes Yunnan Ji, both mentioning Huichuan; 973 Yu Gan article quotes Yunnan Ji, also mentioning that there are Neng Ganzi on the south bank of the Lujiang River. The place names recorded above, including Yazhou, Mingshan, Rongjing, Xin'an, Xuizhou, and Huichuan, are compared with the route from Chengdu to the Nanzhao Barbarian King's Palace recorded in Chapter 1 of Fan Chuo's Barbarian Book. The place names quoted in Yunnan Ji are all on this route. There is a note in the sentence "Barbarian Book crossing the Lujiang River rope bridge" which says, "Yunnan Travelogue says Qusang Post." From this, it can be inferred that the author of Yunnan Ji, Wei Qixiu, entered Yunnan, probably taking the Qingxi Pass road, so he could record his experiences along the way. The places he passed and the Qingxi Pass road recorded in the Barbarian Book are the same. Yuan Zi entered Yunnan, taking the road from Shimen to Luwang Kunshan, that is, Youmenda, also known as the Five-Foot Road between Qin and Han, which is different from Wei Qixiu. Therefore, it is probably beyond doubt that the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era quoted Yunnan Ji as Wei Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue, rather than Yuan Zi's book. In addition to the 23 articles quoted in the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era mentioned above, the original note under the sentence "Crossing the Rope Bridge" in Volume 2 of the Barbarian Book quotes one article, and the original note under the title of Volume 56, Yan Di 5, also records that Wei Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue has ten examinations. In addition, the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era 924 Parrot article quotes two articles from Yunnan Travelogue, one mentioning the Quqian Pavilion and the other mentioning the Xin'an City Road. The Quqian Pavilion cannot be verified, but the Xin'an City Road is still on the Qingxi Pass road, and it should be Hua Qixiu's book. Why the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era quotes one book but divides it into two names is unknown. In addition, the preface roughly quoted by the Qunjing Dushu Zhi, Wei Qixiu's Yunnan Travelogue can be found like this only.</p>
<p>When Wei Shenggui and Wei Qixiu were sent to Yunnan in the third year of Changqing, at the same time, the Tang Dynasty announced that Du Yuanying, the Zhongshu Shilang and Tongping Zhangshi, would be appointed as the Jiedushi of Xichuan. Yuanying was the fifth grandson of Du Ruhui and entered the Hanlin Academy as a Jinshi. After Emperor Muzong ascended the throne, "he became prime minister in less than a year, and was sent out as the Jiedushi of Jiannan Xichuan, Tongping Zhangshi." After arriving in Xichuan, in order to cater to Emperor Muzong and consolidate his favor, he collected all kinds of treasures and dedicated them to the emperor, and abandoned the border defense without regard. As a result, in the third year of Taihe of Emperor Wenzong, Nanzhao launched a large-scale invasion, approaching Chengdu, and the treasures, handicrafts, daughters, and other things in Xichuan were wiped out. The Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance, Tang Dynasty, Volume 3, November, records that Nanzhao invaded Xichuan, saying</p>
<p>Yuanying was arrogant because he was a former prime minister and elegant scholar, and did not understand military affairs. He focused on accumulation and reduced the soldiers' clothing and food. The soldiers garrisoning the southwest border did not receive clothing and food, and they all entered the barbarian territory, where they robbed themselves to supply themselves. The barbarians used clothing and food to fund them. As a result, the movements in Shu were actually known to the barbarians. Nanzhao planned a large-scale invasion from Cuodian, and the border states repeatedly reported it, but Yuanying did not believe it. When Cuodian's troops arrived, the border city was unprepared...</p>
<p>Wei Shenggui and Wei Qixiu were sent to Yunnan in the third year of Changqing, taking the Qingxi Pass road. The states they passed along the way, such as Ya, Li, and Zhui, were exactly the road that Nan Shao invaded in the third year of Taihe. Du Yuanying garrisoned Shu, and the border defense was abandoned. I am afraid that it was influenced by Wei Qixiu's preface to the Yunnan Travelogue, which declared the abandonment of the areas outside Qingxi Pass. The false intelligence led to a great disaster. Later, Li Deyu became the Jiedushi of Xichuan and wanted to reduce Du Yuanying's crime by pushing the responsibility to Wei Gao more than thirty years ago, thinking that Wei Bi should not have made peace with Nanzhao, so the people were slack, and the border was unprepared, so there was the Taihe Rebellion in the third year. Today, it seems that Duke Wei's statement is not a fair one.</p>
<p>In the first year of Zhenyuan of Emperor Dezong, Wei Gao was appointed as the Inspector of the Ministry of Revenue, the Prefect of Chengdu, the Imperial Censor, and the Jiedushi of Jiannan Xichuan, replacing Zhang Yanshang. He sat in Xichuan for twenty-one years. According to the Song History Art and Literature Records, Wei Gao wrote the Southwestern Yi Affairs in twenty volumes. The twenty-one years of management must be recorded in detail in the book. Today, only the Zhenyuan 10th year of Dezong of the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance cites an article from the Southwestern Yi Affairs, which is a mistake in the Biography of Wei Gao in the Old Tang History, and there is nothing else to verify. After Wei Gao, the famous person who garrisoned Shu was Li Deyu. Li Wengong's collection contains a record of Nanzhao's preparations for the border, which says,</p>
<p>When I was in Xichuan, I studied the advantages and disadvantages and collected some important places, which was actually a long-term plan. Therefore, I wrote the Southwestern Border Defense Record in thirteen volumes. The cities and towns I created are all included in the small map, and the equipment and armor are all included... The fourth volume describes the beginning and end of Weizhou, which seems particularly detailed... The New Tang History, Biography of Li Deyu, says that Deyu arrived in Shu.</p>
<p>He built a border planning building and drew a picture on the left of the dangerous terrain of the Southern Road and the mountains and rivers that entered each other, and a picture on the right of the Western Road that was connected to Tubo. The number of tribes, the distance of food supply, and the twists and turns are all included. He summoned those who were familiar with border affairs to point out, discuss, and revise with him, and he knew all the falsehoods of the captives.</p>
<p>Probably the terrain drawn on the left and right sides of the border planning building is included in the small map of the Border Defense Record. Deyu's collection is made in thirteen volumes, and the Song History Art and Literature Records is made in one volume. It is suspected that the Song History has an error. The Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Governance, Taihe 5th year of Emperor Wenzong, May, Li Deyu asked for 4,000 people who were plundered by Nanzhao. Deyu's Southwestern Border Defense Record, Deyu's book has been passed down, and only this one article. The New Tang History, Biography of Deyu, describes his planning in detail during his garrison in Shu. It is suspected that much of it is taken from the Border Defense Record.

<h3>Evolution of Shanghai's Telephone Business</h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>Shanghai's internal telephones are divided into two major systems: one is the Shanghai Telephone Bureau directly under the Ministry of Communications, and the other is the Shanghai Telephone Company operated by American businessmen. In 1881 (the seventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), the British Oriental Telephone Company began to obtain the operating rights of Shanghai's telephones for a period of eighteen years. This was the beginning of Shanghai's urban telephone service. At that time, it was under the jurisdiction of the British Concession Engineering Bureau. In 1900, the British Shanghai Mutual Telephone Company was organized, which was an foreign-invested company. In 1929, the Chinese and foreign companies sold, and the American International Telegraph and Telephone Company (I.T. and T.) bought it and changed its name to Shanghai Telephone Company (S.T.C.), specializing in the telephone business in the old public concession, French concession, and their road-crossing areas. At that time, the number of telephone sets was 33,600. Since then, the concession has become increasingly prosperous, and the number of telephone sets has gradually increased. Although it was twice invaded by Japanese pirates in January 28 and August 13, the telephone sets were damaged. But since the victory, the number of telephone sets has increased to more than 70,000. The telephone operated by foreign businessmen was part of the Engineering Bureau during the era of the Engineering Bureau. People did not know how to use it. Only foreign firms installed telephones, and there were only hundreds of users. It was a magneto type. After the establishment of the Chinese and foreign companies, the central bureau was built, with 30,000 lines of shared telephone exchanges. The Xiqu Lushang Bureau also had 10,000 lines of shared telephone exchanges. After the Shanghai Telephone Company bought it, it expanded greatly, adding Fujian Road Bureau, Mintini Bureau, West Bureau, North Bureau, Huishan Bureau, Bixun Bureau, and Hongqiao Bureau, all of which were changed to Rotary Automatic Sytem. Since then, the company's business has become more and more developed.</p>
<p>When the telephone business in the concession gradually expanded, when its telephone sets crossed the scope of the concession and were installed outside the boundary, the Qing government, in order to maintain its sovereignty, began to establish the Shanghai Nanshi Telephone Bureau in 1902 (the 28th year of Guangxu), in an attempt to prevent the concession telephone from entering the urban area. At that time, the exchange was magneto type, with a capacity of 480 lines and about 200 users. The address was in Maojia Lane in Nanshi. In 1909 (the first year of Xuantong), when the Zhabei branch was opened, the number of users increased sharply. It was planned to build its own bureau building and change the exchange program. In 1922 (the 11th year of the Republic of China), the Nanshi General Bureau was built in Dananmen, with a shared telephone capacity of 2,000 lines. The Zhabei branch was built in Yongxing Road, with a magneto type capacity of 700 lines. The Pudong branch was built in Dongchang Road, with a magneto type capacity of 280 lines. Since then, Jiangwan, Wusong, Nanxiang, and Longhua branches have been opened. In 1929 (the 18th year of the Republic of China), in order to cooperate with the development plan of Greater Shanghai, it was decided to use automatic telephones and ordered 4,800 lines of Strowgre Step-by-step Automatic System. It was planned to install 3,000 lines in the Nanshi General Bureau, 1,500 lines in Zhabei, and 300 lines in Pudong. In 1932 (the 21st year of the Republic of China), on January 28, Japanese pirates built damage in Shanghai. The Zhabei, Jiangwan, Nanxiang, and Wusong branches were all damaged by artillery fire. After the war, the drawing power was restored. On April 15, 1933 (the 22nd year of the Republic of China), the automatic telephones of the Nanshi General Bureau and the Zhabei branch were completed. In 1934 (the 23rd year of the Republic of China), the 300 lines of automatic telephones planned to be installed in the Pudong branch were moved to the newly built city center bureau on Sanmin Road. The Pudong branch was changed to a shared telephone type, with a capacity of 600 lines.</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, the capacity of each exchange of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Bureau Name, Program Type, Capacity</p>
<p>Nanshi Automatic Type 3000</p>
<p>Zhabei Automatic Type 1500</p>
<p>City Center Automatic Type 300</p>
<p>Longhua Automatic Type 150</p>
<p>Pudong Shared Telephone Type 600</p>
<p>Wusong Magneto Type 50</p>
<p>Dachang Magneto Type 50</p>
<p>Zhenru Magneto Type 50</p>
<p>Minhang Magneto Type 50</p>
<p>When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, the Wusong Bureau was the first to be destroyed. The Zhabei City Center, Pudong, Dachang, Zhenru, and other bureaus were all located in the war zone. The machinery was dismantled and moved to the concession for storage to avoid material losses. When the national army withdrew westward, the machinery of the Nanshi, Longhua, Minhang, and other bureaus was also dismantled and stored in the concession. During the Anti-Japanese War, the international situation changed drastically. The machinery dismantled and stored in the concession, except for a part that was transported to the rear, was all occupied by the enemy and puppet forces. The enemy's Huazhong Electric Communication Company occupied the urban area and operated telephones in the second year of the Anti-Japanese War. After the outbreak of the Japanese-American War, the company occupied the American Shanghai Telephone Company and formed the Shanghai Telephone General Bureau. When victory came, the Jiangnan Telecommunications Regulation and Restoration Office was ordered to take over Shanghai's telecommunications business. All the telephones in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the city center were taken over and reorganized, becoming the current telephone exchanges under the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau. As for the Shanghai Telephone Company, after the takeover, the property was returned to its original owner and returned to the merchant for operation.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on the Telegraph Room of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</h3>
<p>— Ning Yongsheng</p>
<p>The "telegraph room" is the business center of the telegraph department. It is in charge of the key to transmitting telegrams. The speed of telegram transmission is closely related to the telegraph room. There are now many types of machines used for receiving and sending telegrams in the telegraph room, such as teletypewriters, high-speed wireless automatic machines, high-speed wired automatic machines, facsimile telegrams, wireless manual machines, wired Morse machines, and wired sound machines. The amount of incoming and outgoing telegrams determines which type of machine is used for which circuit.</p>
<p>Originally, the "telegraph room" of the telecommunications bureau was divided into three parts. The "wireless fast machine telegraph room" and the "wired telegraph room" were installed on the floor of the Fuzhou Road General Business Office. Another part, the "wireless manual machine telegraph room," was installed in Yuyingtang Road, Zhabei, because the environment in Fuzhou Road was not suitable for receiving wireless manual machines. It was called the "Zhabei Branch." Originally, the telegrams between the General Business Office and the Zhabei Branch were sent through teletypewriters or messengers, as well as the necessary numbering procedures. There was one more transfer in between, which inevitably delayed the telegrams in time. The business managers of the telecommunications bureau had worked hard to remedy this problem. Now they have moved from creative planning to concrete - Manual radio receiving and transmitting remote control system - that is, to move the original "wireless manual telegraph room" in Zhabei to the floor of the General Business Office and merge it with the "wireless fast machine telegraph room" and the "six-line telegraph room," and change the Zhabei Branch into a receiving station for the wireless manual telegraph room; and to carry out remote control receiving and sending system in the same way as the fast machine telegraph room. In this way, the telegrams received by the General Business Office can be sent to the upper floor for transmission immediately, without having to be transferred to the Zhabei Branch by teletypewriter or messenger. The problem of time delay due to one more transfer in the middle has been ideally solved, and an average of about one and a half hours can be saved for each telegram. Based on the 4,000 incoming and outgoing telegrams per day from the eight circuits of Yongjia, Xi'an, Nanchang, Kunming, Chengdu, Shenyang, Xiamen, and Shantou, which were recently moved, the savings will reach about 6,000 hours, which should not be a small improvement! Following this creative improvement, five express telegrams were added in Chengdu, Kunming, Yongjia, Xi'an, and Nanchang, which of course gave users a lot of convenience.</p>

<h3>The Way to Send Express Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Xu Dahai</p>
<p>In addition to Fuzhou Road, the Changzhi Road Telegraph Office is open, and recently the Shiliupu Office has also opened. Their accuracy and speed are exactly the same.</p>
<p>"Express Telegram" is the fastest type of commercial telegram. Unless there is a line failure, it is guaranteed to be delivered to the recipient within one and a half hours. As for the fee, it is the same as urgent telegrams, only adding 24,000 yuan for the "express delivery fee". In any case, the Telegraph Office always treats express telegrams differently. Because of this, there are many people sending "express" telegrams. If you don't believe me, look at the "express" window at the General Office of the Telegraph Office, where there is always a long queue every day, which is a loss for the senders in terms of time.</p>
<p>In order to remedy this shortcoming, the Shanghai Telegraph Office has worked hard and successively opened "Express Telegrams" at the demonstration offices at 25 Changzhi Road and 59 Limalu Road in Shiliupu. First, it can save citizens in those areas from having to travel to Fuzhou Road, and second, it can reduce congestion at the General Office and reduce time wasted.</p>
<p>Will an "express telegram" received from the demonstration office be delayed? No. When the receiver receives an "express" telegram, they will carefully look at it (if it has not been decoded, it will be decoded by the decoder), collect the fee, pay the receipt, and immediately send it directly to the report room of the General Office via telex, where the telegraph operator will send it to the receiving location according to the original telegram. The above procedures will be completed within a quarter of an hour. Its speed and accuracy are exactly the same as those sent from the General Office, and the convenience of fewer people sending telegrams sometimes makes it faster than sending from the General Office.</p>
<p>Understanding the above situation, people who know the way to send "express telegrams" will definitely run to the demonstration office to send them.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Telecommunications (8)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 3 How to Choose Special Services</p>
<p>Second type: If the sender indicates "Special Delivery" or the FS symbol at the beginning of the telegram, but the original telegram only lists the recipient's name and address in one place, it means that when the telegram arrives, if the recipient has already left the location of the receiving office, the Telegraph Office should inquire the original address to find out the recipient's whereabouts and new address, and continue to send the original telegram to the address until the telegram is delivered or no one continues to provide the recipient's new address.</p>
<p>For telegrams using the forwarding special service, each additional transmission will incur an additional fee. In addition to the fee for the first place listed in the recipient's address field, which is paid by the sender, the fees for the remaining sections will be collected from the recipient by the telegraph office at the recipient's location when the telegram is delivered. But one point is very important: that is, if the telegram has been delivered but the recipient is unwilling to pay, or the telegram cannot be delivered in the end, or in the second case mentioned above, the recipient's new address cannot be obtained in the end, then all the fees for the sections above the second section will still be collected from the sender. Therefore, when the sender adds the forwarding symbol, they must understand the responsibility they should bear.</p>
<p>(7) Change of Address Recently, the postal service has printed various promotional materials to promote postal common sense, which are affixed to the back of letters and sent to the recipients with the letters. A piece I just received is titled "The Post Office Asks for Your Cooperation," and below it says: "If your communication address has changed, please: (1) Notify your relatives and friends of your new address as soon as possible; (2) Before leaving, leave your new address with a friend who lives with you and ask them to forward it immediately. (The post office does not charge extra for forwarding the original mail). (3) If you have no acquaintance to entrust, please apply to the post office for forwarding mail."</p>
<p>Here, the "Change of Address" special service we are going to talk about is exactly the same in nature as "Forwarding Mail." As far as telegrams are concerned, if the communication address has changed, it is naturally best to notify all parties concerned of the new address in advance. In case of a hasty departure and no time to notify in advance, the new address should be left with family members or relatives and friends living together before leaving, and they should be asked to return the telegrams from various places to the local telegraph office and request that they be changed to the new address. If there is no acquaintance to entrust, you can also declare to the local telegraph office that the telegrams sent to you from various parties should be changed to the new address.</p>
<p>According to public habits, telegrams are usually not sent lightly unless there is a major incident. Therefore, for the sake of careful service, the Telegraph Office has to be more cautious in handling the procedures for changing the address of telegrams than the Post Office in handling the change of address of letters. To give an example, when you ask a friend who lives with you to forward the letters sent to you from various places immediately, as suggested in the second point of the postal service promotional material cited above, as long as you do not open the original envelope and cross out the original address written on the envelope, and add the recipient's new address (or write the recipient's new address on another piece of paper and stick it on the original envelope), you can immediately give it to the postman to take back or put it in a nearby mailbox, and catch up with the original forwarding. The procedure is quite simple. If you want to change the address of a telegram, the applicant for the change of address (referring to your family members or co-residents) must prepare a written application and apply to the local telegraph office before it can be accepted. If there is no acquaintance to entrust, you must also prepare a written application before leaving and apply to the local telegraph office to change the telegrams sent to you from various parties to the new address. Also, if the above application cannot be submitted in advance, you must wait until you arrive at the new place and send a paid public telegram to the telegraph office in the original place (referring to the telegraph office in the new place) to notify them to do so. The Telegraph Office must also require the person applying for the change of address to provide identification documents when necessary in order to be cautious.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the first lecture, the biggest difference between mail and telegrams in terms of billing methods is that mail is billed based on weight, while telegrams are based on the time required for transmission (i.e., the length of the telegram). Therefore, the Post Office stipulates that mail must be forwarded on the original flight in order to avoid additional charges, while the Telegraph Office charges an additional fee for each change of address of a telegram.</p>
<p>In principle, the change of address fee for using the special change of address service must be collected from the recipient when the telegram is delivered. If the recipient refuses to pay or the telegram cannot be delivered in the end, the Telegraph Office will collect it from the applicant for the change of address. However, for telegrams that only need to be changed to one place, if requested by the applicant for the change of address, the applicant for the change of address must pay the change of address fee in advance. If necessary, the applicant for the change of address can also request the Telegraph Office to change the telegram originally listed as an ordinary telegram to an urgent telegram for change of address, or change the telegram originally listed as an urgent telegram to an ordinary telegram for change of address, and prepay the change of address fee according to the changed telegram type.</p>
<p>The fee payment symbol for the change of address special service is "Changed from... (location)" or Recirected from... (place name), which is combined into one word when sending. Addresses that have been delivered but have not been delivered properly are omitted when changing the address. For example:</p>
<p>(Original telegram sent to Shanghai) Wang Daren, No. (2492), Nanjing West Road, Shanghai... (The telegram text and signature follow)</p>
<p>(First change of address to Hankou) Recirected from Shanghai Wang Daren, Xuan Palace Hotel, Hankou... (The telegram text and signature follow)</p>
<p>(Second change of address to Chongqing) Redirected from Shanghai Hankow Wang Daren, No. (536), Section 3, Zhongshan Road, Chongqing... (The telegram text and signature follow)</p>
<p>Finally, please do not misunderstand: the "change of address" mentioned in this section refers to changing the address to another place. If the recipient is only moving to another address in the same place, they only need to notify the Telegraph Office of the new address in advance to change the delivery, or simply stick a note on the door of the original address stating the new address, and the Telegraph Office's messenger will change the delivery to the address.</p>
<h3>Basic Knowledge of International Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Shi Jinrong</p>
<p>Everyone who sends a telegram hopes to send it quickly, and it's true, and to pay less, but the hope is symmetrical, half on others, half on oneself. One should have a common sense of sending telegrams, how to send them quickly, what kind of telegrams are fast, how to avoid mistakes, how to remedy mistakes, and how to make them cheaper. This is what Shanghainese call the doorway. Please see below:</p>
<p>Where to Send International Telegrams</p>
<p>International telegrams are operated by international radio stations. In Shanghai, there are currently three business offices, namely the General Office in the Sassoon Building and two branch offices on Fuzhou Road and Sinan Road. If the sender feels that the distance is inconvenient, they can call 11120 to notify the international radio station to send an external business officer to collect the telegram between 10:00 am and 8:00 pm every day. No other fees are charged except for the telegram fee, but telegrams collected by telephone must be sent with cash and are not temporarily applicable to sending telegrams on account.</p>
<p>Which Telegram is the Most Cost-Effective</p>
<p>There are several types of telegrams sent for commercial and private purposes. Now I will add explanations to the name, price, and speed, and you will know at a glance.</p>
<p>Ordinary Telegram - Uses clear language, charges the full fee, and is the fastest to transmit except for official urgent telegrams.</p>
<p>Code Telegram - The telegram text uses a code composed of five letters, which is 60% of the full fee and is transmitted at the same time as ordinary telegrams, with a minimum of five words.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram - Charges double the fee for ordinary and code telegrams and is sent in advance.</p>
<p>Deferred Telegram - The telegram text uses clear language, which is half of the full fee and is sent after ordinary telegrams, with a minimum of five words.</p>
<p>Letter Telegram - The telegram text uses clear language, which is one-third of the full fee. Night letter telegrams must be delivered on the morning of the day after the delivery date, and day letter telegrams must be delivered on the second morning of the delivery date, with a minimum of 25 words.</p>
<p>Among the above six types of telegrams, code telegrams are the most economical and affordable, costing only 60% of the fee, and are as fast as ordinary telegrams, and one code can include several sentences, so code telegrams can be regarded as cheap and good.</p>
<p>How to Use Time Difference</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the time is different between China and foreign countries. We eat lunch here, and New York eats midnight snack there. London goes to the office, and we are off work. So when we send telegrams to the United States during our office hours, it is already night in the United States. Unless they also work at night, it is cheaper to send deferred telegrams. When sending telegrams to Europe, we can send deferred telegrams in the morning, which happens to be their office hours. Of course, the above refers to normal communication conditions. If the work is not smooth and the telegrams are crowded, it should be considered separately.</p>
<p>Write Clearly</p>
<p>The letters UNVCI in English are most easily mistaken. Clear language can still be explained in detail, but code cannot be translated. So it is necessary to write clearly, so that it can be understood at a glance. Even when typing, it is best to use all capital letters. Place names, addresses, and numbers must be clearer. If there is one name and several places, be sure to add a clear note.</p>
<p>How to Send Free and Cheap Telegrams</p>
<p>Is it possible to send telegrams without spending money? Yes, if there are several empty and unclear meanings or some questions in the telegram you received, you can ask the radio station to send a telegram to inquire, without charging a fee. If you want to add to, correct, or even cancel a few words after the telegram is sent, you don't have to send another telegram. Just bring the receipt and ask the radio station to do it for you, and you will only be charged for the words you want to add, correct, or cancel. If there is no reply for a long time after the telegram is sent, and you want to urge the recipient to reply quickly, you don't have to send another telegram. Just bring the receipt and ask the radio station to do it for you, and you will only be charged for one word, which saves money and trouble.</p>

<h3>Notes on Looking at Paintings</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Appreciating calligraphy and painting is an elegant matter for poets and literati. This sentence is neither commendatory nor derogatory, because painting is a top art. Without considerable cultivation, one is not worthy of talking about appreciation. The reason why this article is titled "Looking at Paintings" is to declare in advance that although I like paintings, I only have the qualification to look at them with my naked eyes and direct intuition. I cannot talk about appreciation. Moreover, because I am not worthy of appreciation, the paintings I like to look at are definitely not masterpieces that are not ingenious in the art world.</p>
<p>To say something that is not embarrassing, the paintings I like to look at are just what the country people call "foreign paintings." These days, there are many of these things on the roadside stalls or on the walls along the street, such as Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives, the 108 heroes of Liangshanbo, and the rat welcoming relatives. Although they are not elegant, I personally think they are worth seeing.</p>
<p>Although most of the audience of this kind of folk gallery are country people or children, judging from the smiles on their faces and the gestures of their criticism and observation, although they don't know what art is, their naive requirements for art are probably more emotionally genuine than the elegant audience in the famous painting exhibitions.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been famous painting exhibitions in Shanghai from time to time. It is said that there are many people "supporting the show," and the higher the price, the more畅销the sales are. A "masterpiece" often has four or five red paper strips with "Mr. So-and-so ordered" stuck on it, which shows that art and culture are not as "declining" as generally said; however, looking at the advertisements in the newspaper, I feel that most of the sponsors of famous painting exhibitions are several familiar names. Probably because the art is becoming more and more advanced, the fewer people who appreciate it. Thinking of this, I can't help but feel sad for the art.</p>
<p>I have said that appreciating profound art requires a considerable degree of cultivation; however, the meaning of art's existence is probably not limited to just appreciation, especially not just for the appreciation of a few rich people as decoration or embellishment. In the hands of a few literati, art has almost been regarded as the tip of the tower on the ivory tower, and has become a shackle that ordinary people cannot reach. But real art must be human, and it must be something with flesh and blood.</p>
<p>I admit that there are genius artists in the world, because a person may have a special talent. But I don't believe that there is art from heaven and human world except for the art created by nature itself. Because people's artistic requirements are just human's true, good, and beautiful emotional requirements. Artistic perceptions vary with each person's living conditions, but the point of being based on emotion to demand is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Some people ridicule the classics in the calligraphy and painting market recently because many nouveau riche want to be elegant. This may be part of the truth. But whether it is a nouveau riche or a family of scholars, loving calligraphy and painting cannot be considered a sin; the sin is a generation of so-called artists who are willing to sacrifice the public's artistic requirements for money.</p>
<p>For example, many people criticize the street comics for containing "feudal toxins," which is indeed true; like those "foreign paintings" such as Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives and Liangshanbo heroes, they can also be said to contain "toxins"; however, if our noble artists are only focused on drawing a few sparse ink groups or so-called new impressionists that make people more and more confused, then the "folk gallery" will probably only be occupied by things like Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives, and the comic book stalls on the streets and alleys will always become public libraries.</p>
<p>In the history of modern painting, many changes have taken place in terms of both technique and subject matter, especially in terms of technique. There have been countless changes in light and color alone, but as a result of over-emphasis on technique, the content of the paintings is becoming more and more distant from the public's artistic requirements. On the contrary, "foreign paintings" such as Sun Wukong making havoc in the Heavenly Palace and Zhu Bajie recruiting relatives have remained the same for decades, but they are still the only "wall decoration" for rural families to decorate the New Year. Rural people may only use these things as wallpaper, but in their eyes, they are more pleasing to the eye than those things full of oil paints and ink groups. As for whether there are "feudal toxins," how can you and I blame the rural people!</p>
<h3>The Shadow of Truth</h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>Eating at a table for eight immortals, I faced the four long windows, only to see the shadow of the window reflected in a bowl of soup. As the soup moved, the shadow of the window flickered, which was very beautiful. I intended to ask my two younger brothers to appreciate it, but then I changed my mind. One was sitting on my left, and the other was sitting opposite me, just facing away from the long window. Neither of them would see the scene I had discovered.</p>
<p>The long windows were still those long windows, but because we had different positions and different viewpoints, the impressions we got were different. What I see now is not the true appearance of the long window, but only the shadow of the long window. The soup reflects the shadow; the flickering is the fluctuation of the water, but the long window stands there without flickering.</p>
<p>Understanding that it is due to different positions or different backgrounds, I did not force anyone to appreciate the flickering long window.</p>
<p>This is originally a common sense, not rare. However, there are so many people who have ignored this common sense throughout the ages. Ancient Confucian scholars and sages, occasionally feeling something, express it in writing, and naturally there is a supreme principle, but he only expresses his momentary experiences or feelings, and does not mean to ask others to always regard it as a golden rule. It is the later corrupt scholars who annotate in detail and judge it as an unchanging truth. There are even "scholars" who value sects and blindly believe that truth is only found in one family, and that others are heresies, attacking each other and creating many unnecessary disputes. Later people also participated in the sectarian disputes, fighting only for the sake of anger, and getting further and further away from the truth. If they could understand the positions or backgrounds of the ancient Confucian scholars and sages, they might understand their intentions more clearly and would not be so "persistent."</p>
<p>Scholars who study ancient books all day long are diligent and isolated from real life. After years of accumulation, they may suddenly dig something out of ancient books due to occasional inspiration. However, they issue it as a theory, believing it to be a truth, and insist that others appreciate it in the same way. We must not believe it so easily, it must not be the truth, but only the shadow of the truth. There are also some people who create new ideas with the sole purpose of attracting the attention of others in order to achieve their goal of selling their reputation. Then, what they call truth will naturally be greatly discounted.</p>
<p>Even if it is the truth, it must be seen under what conditions it is produced. The truth under certain conditions may be completely different in another position and viewpoint. For example, the axioms and formulas in Euclidean geometry are completely incomprehensible in non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>I accidentally saw a passage of ancient text, which is the confession of a loyal minister who died for his country: "A wife's service to her husband is like a subject's service to the ruler. If a subject's wife does not betray the subject, how dare the subject betray the country!" It is really the tone of a complete slave. The so-called wife is a slave to her husband, and subjects are slaves to the emperor. Looking at it in this democratic era, one cannot help but denounce it as absurd. However, in the era when foot binding was prevalent, how many people had true knowledge and saw that foot binding was a crime? At that time, not a single loving mother did not choose to sit and watch her beloved daughter cry. What the predecessors thought was natural and insisted on fighting for is now nothing more than a joke. Do not say that "people's hearts are not as old as before" must be a bad phenomenon, the liberation of thought from all constraints is a great progress.</p>
<h3>"Generate Wealth for Me"</h3>
<p>— Wang Kao</p>
<p>Going out during the New Year, you can probably see "Generate Wealth for Me" plastered all over the walls everywhere. Getting rich is of course a common requirement of Chinese people, and "Generate Wealth for Me" can especially represent the national character and lifestyle of China. Why? Although China boasts a lot about being "vast in territory and abundant in resources," if we count the amount of property owned by each farmer, before the war, it was only about 20 to 30 yuan on average. Converted into today's figures, even if multiplied by 200,000 times, it would only be 4 to 6 million yuan. Their clothes do not cover their bodies, their houses do not keep out the wind and rain, and they cannot even talk about nutrition when it comes to food. That is why some people say that China is only divided into big poverty and small poverty, and there is no difference between having property and not having property. It is precisely because of this that people generally have a strong desire to get rich. In fact, the so-called getting rich is nothing more than maintaining a life of basic needs. Mencius's utopia is just a house of five acres, planted with mulberry trees, so that people in their seventies can wear silk, and even chickens, pigs, dogs, and hogs can be raised at the right time, so that they can eat meat, etc., almost without mentioning any spiritual life. What is strange to us is that from Confucius, Mencius, Mozi, and Laozi to the present, it has been about 3,000 years, and this extremely limited "freedom from hunger" is still ethereal. Not only do we feel ashamed when we see foreigners, but it seems that we also have too great a responsibility to the former philosophers. Then, how can we easily criticize the idea of "getting rich"? However, there are really too many ways to get rich. Generally, there are only two ways. One is to get rich by benefiting both oneself and others, and the other is to get rich by harming others and benefiting oneself. Unfortunately, most of us Chinese have chosen the latter, which has only made the society, which has been stagnant for 3,000 years, sink even further. This is also a great tragedy.</p>
<p>"Generate Wealth for Me" is the general representative of harming others and benefiting oneself. The so-called for me is to benefit oneself, and it also has exclusivity, which is to harm others. Originally, the moral concepts of the whole world have been messed up to a very confusing point. What everyone respects is not morality itself, but money. The gates of lords and princes are filled with benevolence and righteousness. No wonder materialists say that ideology depends on the economic base. However, in other countries, there is always an unwritten law, that is, the acquisition of money must come from reputable work. Even if there are kidnappers in New York and Chicago, and there are often corruption cases in New York State, after all, the people of the whole country despise them and even hate them from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, the country is not controlled by the harming-others-and-benefiting-oneself faction in the end, and most of the wealth is still in the hands of industrial families such as Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller, and DuPont. It is absolutely not like our China, where getting promoted is a shortcut to getting rich, and breaking the law is the beginning of one's own career. Leaving that aside, as long as a person sits in a car and owns a foreign house, absolutely no one asks about the source of these properties. If it is discovered that his source is not proper, then public opinion will sanction him. I boldly analyze the psychology of Chinese people, which is probably like the fox saying that the grapes are sour because it cannot eat them. Maybe I cannot guarantee myself. When it really comes to the time of the test, whether I have that much determination. In the past, someone in Zeng Wenzhenggong's mansion wrote an eight-legged essay saying that he was not moved by beautiful women and red and blue hats. He even bragged about himself to the governor. A young man jokingly added a comment: "Beautiful women and red and blue hats are on the side, and he is not moved by either. He just wants to see the master!" This is impersonating a gentleman, and his motive is nothing more than that. If he completely puts his conscience under his arm, what else is there to say? Money has no symbol. Stolen goods and wages are no different in terms of banknotes. This is a major loss of modern civilization. What is related is how the collective moral concept of the nation is. Today, if you want to make a bookworm maintain his tightness and complete his purity and integrity, it is a dream. Even the most reliable person has 70% unreliability. Think about who is doing it, who is causing it? This cannot be said that the scholars are not competitive, the society has no fair and healthy moral standard, that is, the property standard, which is our daily great suffering. In the past, we could still say that we were Qing Gao, but now we must be clear, otherwise we will not be high. Without him, without money, we will naturally not be high. Social scientists often like to call modern culture capitalist culture. In fact, although the meaning of capitalism is inevitable to exploitation, it still has some benefits for mankind. For example, although we oppose Ford's accumulation of wealth, we cannot but agree with and use cars, which is very obvious. Only Chinese culture and popular thinking cannot be represented by capitalism, but can only be said to be theft, which is still very different from capitalism. What a pity!</p>
<h3>Fleeting Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (69)</p>
<p>Yu Ru was very embarrassed by this sentence, and just as he was about to explain, Qi Wan said again, "Old gentleman, I am a straightforward person. I say what's on my mind, regardless of whether people like to hear it or not, but if I say it, I can do it. I may have lost my composure under these intense stimuli today. Please forgive me!" Seeing that she spoke very firmly, Yu Ru knew that she must be very determined in her actions. He nodded and said, "Good, good, I believe you, and I sympathize with you very much. You have suffered too much injustice. Your spirit of sacrificing yourself for the benefit of others is extremely admirable!" Qi Wan said, "This is nothing. Since things have come to this point, this is how it should be done. But I have one thing to ask of you, old gentleman. I will not tell anyone what you said to me today, and I hope you won't reveal what I promised to Zhu either. Because as soon as he knows, his attitude will change again. At that time, I will be entangled by personal feelings, and may lose my reason and no longer have the courage to fulfill my promise. Old gentleman, take advantage of my clear mind now and leave. If I promise you, I must do it." As she spoke, she stood up and bowed to Yu Ru. Seeing Qi Wan enduring the pain in her heart, her resolute expression overflowing in her words, Yu Ru was very impressed. He nodded to Qi Wan and said, "I admire you, I respect you, and I sympathize with you very much. I hope you won't make yourself suffer too much. Even if you are forced by circumstances in the future and cannot fulfill your previous promise, I will forgive you." Qi Wan said, "Old gentleman, believe me, I am confident I can do it." As she spoke, she saw Yu Ru to the door. Yu Ru clasped his hands in a bow and said, "Take care of yourself." Qi Wan, with tears in her eyes, returned to the room, feeling extremely sad. She couldn't help but collapse on the bed and cry loudly. Little Wang's mother entered the room to comfort her. After Qi Wan cried for a while, venting the pent-up frustration in her chest, she saw that Little Wang's mother was still standing beside her, trying to console her. She said to her, "Don't tell Mr. Xu that Mr. Xu came to our house today." Little Wang's mother said, "What exactly is the matter, madam, that you are so sad?" Qi Wan said, "You don't need to ask. You will understand naturally later." Seeing that Qi Wan was full of sadness, Little Wang's mother didn't dare to say more, only saying, "Madam, don't be sad. Mr. Xu is a good person. Don't listen to other people's gossip." Qi Wan said, "I haven't listened to other people's gossip." As she spoke, she pursed her lips, frowned, and hesitated for a long time. Suddenly, she walked into the bedroom, dialed the telephone, and Little Wang's mother followed her. Seeing her pick up the receiver, she said a few simple words, as if arranging to meet someone, which was inexplicable. After Qi Wan made the phone call, she sat down in front of the dressing table and carefully touched up her makeup. Since her father's death, she had not worn makeup due to the mourning period. Today, she heavily relied on cosmetics, applying rouge and powder, drawing her eyebrows, and applying lipstick. Her scattered perm was then styled by Little Wang's mother. Then, she went to the dressing room, opened the wardrobe, picked out a very bright floral satin cheongsam, looked at herself in the mirror, and came out, saying to Little Wang's mother, "I have something to go out for, and I may not come home for dinner. When Mr. Xu comes, if he asks where I went, tell him you don't know."</p>
<h3>Records of Lost Sounds</h3>
<p>— Copper</p>
<p>Mr. Vincent Edwards of New York has a passion for collecting gramophone records. He has already collected two thousand records of speeches by famous people. What is especially valuable is that most of the people who gave those speeches have passed away. Vincent Edwards has realized the ideal of Edison, the inventor of the gramophone record: "To preserve the voices and speeches of Lincoln and Washington for our next generation."</p>
<p>In his national voice academy, you can hear Florence Nightingale talk about her work as a nurse, or Robert Peary talk about how he discovered the North Pole. You can hear the voices of historical figures such as Queen Victoria, the French actress Bernhardt, the novelist Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the humorist Will Rogers, Emperor Joseph, the famous actress Barnum, the radio inventor Marconi, and the British Prime Minister Disraeli, among others.</p>
<p>The most moving record in Vincent Edwards' collection is the bugle call of the famous "Charge of the Light Brigade" (an American film company made a film called "The Charge of the Light Brigade"). It was recorded in London in 1890 by the bugler Landfrey, who was the only survivor of the Charge at that time, and he used the same bugle as on that fateful day to record it.</p>
<h3>On Everyone Eating Eggs</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>Some time ago, a conference was held in Shanghai. A representative gave a speech, and the newspapers only recorded two sentences of his speech: "We should not have everyone eat rice, but everyone should have rice to eat." (Something to that effect, I forgot the exact words.) At the time, I thought it was very strange: isn't everyone having rice to eat the same as everyone eating rice? Why is the former considered desirable and the latter undesirable? This question was not clear to me until yesterday when I overheard two tea drinkers chatting at a tea house.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: How is life in England?</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: Very difficult. One person can only eat one egg a week.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: Oh my goodness!</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: But everyone doesn't complain, because everyone only eats one egg.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: Why doesn't everyone complain if they only eat one egg?</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: Because with four thousand million eggs to supply four thousand million people, everyone eats eggs, so what is there to complain about?</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: It can be seen that people's hearts are truly bad. They are only happy when everyone eats the same small amount as them, and not happy when others eat more than them.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: It's not that people's hearts are bad, but that there are too few eggs. England has four thousand million people, but the English hens cannot produce four thousand million eggs every day or every hour. This week's four thousand million eggs are all obtained by the government. If Attlee has to eat seventeen eggs every week, Churchill has to eat twenty-eight eggs every week, and other civil and military officials, wealthy merchants, and magnates each have to eat three or four eggs every week, then some people won't even be able to eat half an egg every six months.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: Hmm. But I think it's better for everyone to have eggs to eat than for everyone to eat eggs.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: Why?</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: Because the former is a bit domineering, while the latter is the way of benevolent rule.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: Explain in more detail.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: Eggs are nutritious and very beneficial to the body, so it is better to eat more. Everyone eating eggs is limited to the existing eggs, and the existing eggs are not originally one per person. Forcibly dividing them up and eating them, although it is equal, leads to scarcity and domineering behavior. Everyone having eggs to eat means that everyone competes to eat eggs. Even if some people eat thirty or forty eggs in an hour, and some people only eat one egg in thirty or forty hours, it is still more in line with the way of benevolent rule than one egg per person per week.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: What you say is not without reason. But the result of competing to eat eggs will certainly not be as good as you imagine. There will definitely be some people who get sick from eating too many eggs, and some people who get sick from not eating any eggs.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: That's their own fault. Who told them not to get eggs to eat.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: It's definitely not their own fault. There are only two ways to get eggs to eat: either raise chickens or steal them.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: You can also buy them.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: That's right, you can also buy them. But there are only so many eggs. If you, me, and him all rush to buy them, the price will definitely skyrocket, and people with no money will never have eggs to eat.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: Then raise chickens.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: Poor people generally don't have time to raise chickens. Rich people also don't like to raise chickens.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: Then there's no way.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: One egg per person is the way.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker A: But I still think it's better for everyone to have eggs to eat.</p>
<p>Tea Drinker B: I don't necessarily insist on everyone eating eggs, but sometimes there can only be everyone eating eggs. For example, after drinking tea, I want to take a piece of cake home. I have as many as six children. There is only one piece of cake, so I say that everyone eats the cake, divide it into six equal parts, and everyone gets one. If everyone has a cake to eat, I'm afraid I would have to buy three or four cakes to avoid the big ones snatching from the small ones, and the strong taking from the weak. But I only have enough money to buy one piece of cake.</p>
<p>I had to leave because I had something to do and didn't hear their conclusion, but I had already realized that the above-mentioned representative's "everyone eat rice" versus "everyone have rice to eat" is similar to the debate between Tea Drinker A and Tea Drinker B about "everyone eating eggs" versus "everyone have eggs to eat." However, I dare not make a judgment on which is right and which is wrong.</p>
<h3>People and Flowers</h3>
<p>— Jiang Duxin</p>
<p>In the past, people liked to use various flower names to describe various women, and they also liked to use the idiom "flower-like face and moon-like appearance" to describe a woman's beauty. But two news items on page eight of the Shen Bao tell us in even more depth a fact that contrasts "people" and "flowers," and that is: "People are cheaper than flowers!"</p>
<p>Because the positions of these two news items are not next to each other, readers may find it difficult to compare them. Here, the author does not mind the trouble and specifically copies them below for readers to ponder for themselves!</p>
<p>(1) "Hefei, 7th Telegram: Citizen Zhang Chengren, due to financial difficulties and unable to get through the New Year, came up with a strange idea and posted an advertisement on the bulletin board next to the Anhui Daily office, roughly saying: 'Urgently need funds, specifically selling his young son, only collecting six million legal tender.'"</p>
<p>(2) "Guangzhou, 7th Telegram: As the Lunar New Year approaches, various flowers are on the market here. Peonies cost 15 million yuan per pot, and the highest price for a branch of plum blossoms is 20 million..."</p>
<p>After reading these two news items, I think readers cannot help but be moved, right?</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>The world is a permanent dance stage, with all of humanity playing the role of actors. The entrance is the maternity hospital, and the exit is the funeral parlor.</p>
<p>There are no absolutely good or bad people in the world. So-called good people are those who have done more good deeds than bad deeds in their lives; conversely, bad people are those who have done more bad deeds than good deeds in their lives.</p>
<p>The spatial distances in the world are becoming closer due to scientific advances, but the spiritual distances between humans are becoming farther and farther.</p>
<h3>Lighter than a Feather</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>It is said that in the cradle days of airplanes, when they were still called airships, ordinary people did not dare to try them, because this new means of transportation was too dangerous. If they fell down, they would be smashed to pieces, just a death lighter than a feather. Therefore, at that time, the people who rode airplanes were all adventurers and scientists—those who had a special interest in the aircraft industry, embraced the humanitarianism of martyrs, and took it as their responsibility to improve its devices and equipment were the first heroes to soar into the clouds.</p>
<p>Airplanes have been improved to their current state of equipment, from the most rudimentary of hanging a basket under a lighter-than-air balloon to the fish-style rocket plane that scientists are still dreaming about today, in preparation for a long journey to the moon. In the process, I don't know how many precious lives have been sacrificed. Do you say that this kind of death is lighter than a feather? Actually, it is not. Precisely because life only happens once, aircraft manufacturers have to be cautious. Each accident is a painful experience. Relying on this painful experience has laid the foundation for today's flight safety equipment, which has not yet reached the ideal, but is already quite impressive. Of course, using airplanes to drop bombs and destroy countless lives at once is another matter altogether, a digression, so let's not talk about it for the time being.</p>
<p>Although there are many airplane accidents today, there are still people who ride them, because of the function of the airplane itself—its becoming an undeniable means of transportation. Therefore, we cannot close all air routes because of accidents, just as we cannot stop eating because of choking.</p>
<p>However, there is something that has no value in itself, and is enough to endanger life, and should actually be abolished, but the authorities have not stopped it, allowing irreplaceable lives to disappear as easily as feathers. How sad is that? What is this thing? It is the firecrackers that I have called for to be abolished in this column. Since the last article was published, one tragic event after another has been reported in the newspapers. Those who are concerned about social news should know, and I will not list them here. On the 5th of this month, two more tragedies occurred. One was a young man surnamed Lu living on Jingting Road, who was making money selling firecrackers. Due to the explosion of his stock, he was covered in injuries and died after being sent to the hospital. The other was a Mr. Chen from Pudong, who had imported a large quantity of firecrackers. He accidentally dropped them on the ground, and they exploded, severing his left foot on the spot, and also causing serious injuries to his head and hands.</p>
<p>People who sell firecrackers do it for a living, but the result is that they burn themselves to death, just like moths flying into a flame. This is a warning to today's fire players. And their death does not benefit the firecrackers themselves. It is truly lighter than a feather. We don't know why firecrackers should still exist! If it is because the United States welcomes them, and we can use them to earn foreign exchange, and therefore not prohibit their production, that is truly as absurd as "the moon is rounder in foreign countries!"</p>
<h3>Madman</h3>
<p>— Fang Ji</p>
<p>A Russian was walking down the street when he suddenly said to himself, "Our government is full of rogues. Their only policy is to fool the people!"</p>
<p>A policeman immediately walked over and grabbed his clothes. The passerby's friend came to defend him, saying, "Don't grab him. He's a madman!"</p>
<p>The policeman said, "Hey! If he really is a madman, how could he know so much detail and accuracy?"</p>

<h3>Lin Boqin's Birthday Celebration Converted to Education Assistance</h3>
<p>All Employees of Yipin Hostel Donate Rewards for Education Assistance</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Boqin of this newspaper recently celebrated his forty-ninth birthday. Friends such as Xu Zhenwu and Shan Guoliang sent congratulations. Mr. Lin, realizing that the loss of education for young people is a loss for society and the country, lovingly donated all of the 14 million yuan in celebratory gifts received to the "Reader Education Assistance Fund" to aid impoverished students and create blessings for friends. Mr. Lin's frugality in assisting education and his courage in doing good are commendable. It is hoped that people of the community will follow suit, so that the "Reader Education Assistance Fund" can reach its intended goal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Huile Lane on Fuzhou Road in this city suffered an accident on January 15 of this year. Thanks to the efforts of all the employees of the nearby Yipinxiang Hostel, the fire was quickly extinguished. The owner of the hostel rewarded the employees who contributed with 3 million yuan in legal tender. The employees, recognizing the urgent need to rescue those deprived of education, donated the entire amount to the "Reader Education Assistance Fund," fully demonstrating the spirit of righteousness and courage of the hostel's employees. In addition to accepting the donation, this newspaper respectfully expresses the highest respect on behalf of the impoverished students.</p>
