<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕第一届國民大會，定卅日晨九時舉行預備會議，討論主席團之選舉辦法，根據國民大會組織法之規定，主席團爲廿五人。據悉：卅日討論時，將爲每一選舉單位（如每一區域職業團體華僑等）推選主席團候選人，凡代表額達三十人者，推選一人，六十人者推選二人，餘類推，且所　選者不除單位之代表為限，推舉結果，即印發全體代表，以無記名投票法選舉主席團廿五人。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕蔣主席於廿九日晨國民大會開幕式中致詞，其要點略如左：（一）國民革命之目的，在建設中國爲民有。民治·民享之三民主義國家，但是內憂外患紛起迭乘，阻礙民主憲政之實施，一部革命建國史，充滿了困苦艱難的犧牲奮鬥史。中華民國憲法，乃是血淚凝成的結晶，我們制定了憲法，更須芟除障礙，保證憲政的成功。（二）憲法，可分爲三大部份，第一是人民的權利義務，第二是國家的政治組織，第三是國家的基本政策。這三部份就是民有·民治·民享的內容。民權主義的基礎在於民族，民權主義　目的在於民主，我們應把握這個要點，來體認中國憲政的前途。（三）依建國大綱的規定，國民大會舉行大選以後，國民政府授權於民選政府，是爲建國之大功吿成，但是我們建國最大的障礙是什麼？共產黨反對憲法，反對行憲的國民大會，甘心作民主的罪人，我們要保證憲政的成功，不能不悉力戡亂。（四）此次國民大會是行憲的第一届大會，憲法甫吿施行，利弊得失之所在，還沒具體的經驗可供修正的參考，因之，大會使命只是行使選舉權，以完成中華民國政府的組織，每一代表所投神聖的一票，部是代表國民的，憲法上保障人民自由，施行基本國策，維護中華民民國領土主權的責任，已付託於憲政政府，敬祝大會成功。（全文刋二版）</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕中國靑年黨主席曾琦，於出席國大開幕禮後，發表談話云：「中華民國創建三十七年，到今年纔有正式的憲法，和正式民意機構的成立。並將依據憲法，而產生民選的政府，這國家進入「現代化」「民主化」的第一步。過去慘淡經營得有今天的結果，全賴國家有賢明的領袖，人民有一致的要求，各黨各派與社會賢達，有共同的意志，群策羣力，一德一心，堅苦奮鬥，不爲浮議所動，不因內亂灰心，然後纔能進入憲政階段。吾人應如何重視此一盛舉，希望國大同人依據憲法所賦與的權力，本於「選賢與能」的宗旨，鄭重其事，選舉總統及副總統領導國人，推進憲政，成立正式的「民選政府」，以廣大的「包容性」和「建設力」，對付一部份好亂成性，挾有「國際背景」，以武力爲政爭工具之「破壞份子」。期於第二次國民大會以前，努力造成全民福利的國家，庶不負國民所付托的神聖使命。」</p>

<p>本報特寫　（三月廿九日於南京）</p>
<p>「國民大會的召開，是三十七年來第一件大事」。</p>
<p>蔣主席在國民大會開幕典禮致開會詞時如此說着，召開國民大會，使國家步入憲政時期，國民政府還政於民，是孫中山先生倡導國民革命的終極目標，這目標的造成，誠然是中華民國卅七年來第一件大事。但是，擴大一點說，這第一届國民大會的召開和行憲，在五千年中國歷史上亦何嘗不是嶄新的一頁，且讓我們看這一頁是如何隆重而輝煌的寫下來的。</p>
<p>卅七年前的三月廿九日，中國國民黨的革命者在廣州起義失敗，但這春天裏的失敗奠定了秋天的成功，革命先烈們擲頭　，洒鮮血，以爭取實現的理想，也終於在卅七年後顯諸世人。第一届國民大會選定三月廿九日這天開幕的意　是重大的，而當蔣主席領導全體國民代表覲謁國父靈寢與致祭革命先烈，陣亡將士曁死難同胞時，使人記起國民革命歷程由數不盡的內憂外患，憶見那來路上屍骨血汗，更加體味到兩　所載的民主重担。</p>
<p>廿九日有着南京今年最好的天氣，從子夜到凌晨國大籌委會的信差依次　開每一個代表和每一家　館的大門，趕送九時謁陵，十時春祭和十一時舉行開幕典禮的通知，夜霧冉冉昇起，朗星消失在漸濃的霧氛里，八點鐘前後，陵園過上奔駛着近千輛的大小汽車，人像漲潮似的湧上國父陵園的石坪和石階。快到九點鐘，陽光突然衝　了重霧，正巧讓道行憲的好消息在風和日麗由帶給國父和先烈在天之靈，中國歷史之新頁也在靑天白日映耀下揭露着筆。</p>
<p>十一點鐘前後，國民大會當前再找不到一年來慣有的冷落，裝飾着「中華民國萬歲」的霓虹燈的照　前汽車行列川流不息，佩帶着各色絹條的人們，談着，笑着，　進門楣上　着國旗閃耀着「天下爲公」紅燈字的會堂的大門。門廊裏正面是兩個代表報到欄，兩旁是來賓和政府首長與外賓的簽名處，郵政局和電信局裏依然是制　國大時的老人，會塲正面的三個描金朱漆大門洞開，　着　了金的「以建民國」，「以進方同」的對聯更見堂皇。進入會場，水銀燈把主席台和大半個會塲照射的通明，台上後　正中是一幅大多寬的大國旗，兩邊是兩方髹金的憲法模型和嘉禾的浮雕，旗前立着國父的油畫遺像，兩旁伴以翠柏盆景，再前是陳供着一瓶鮮花的長案，近台口是主席　案，台口兩側樹着兩大　國旗，此外，會塲四　隨處裝飾着大小國旗，銀漆憲法模型與嘉禾圖案，藍白紅三色在乳色牆壁上映着燈光，表現出一派富麗，一皇，莊重與祥瑞的氣象。在這樣的會塲裏，開始寫下中國歷史之新頁。樓下坐滿了男女代表，樓上坐的是各部會次官，中外來賓和國民，靑年，民社三黨的常委。十一點半在樂聲悠揚裏開幕典禮開始，蔣主席致開會詞，高齡的吳稚輝老先生領導代表宣誓後，在樂聲　禮成。</p>
<p>第一届國民大會終於開幕了，在這閃耀着革命的光榮的日子——三月廿九日，回顧這開幕前的時日，眞如那夜間與早晨瀰　着的重霧，而隨了開幕典禮開始與結束時的禮樂　，人們又　是看到那靑天白　　霧而時的喜悅。出席的代表們高興自不必說，經辦選舉和籌備事務的官吏。及負責行憲前　渡政務的官吏也同樣的高興。在陰霧的日子裏，選舉糾紛的解法，政治和法律的抉擇，政黨代表席次的商榷，沉車的壓抑着人心，煞費排解，若干要員忙累到深夜，終於賴蔣主席的感召，國民黨紀律的約束，國民黨員的個人犧牲，民。靑兩黨的推誠合作，解決了所有存在的問題。中國的行憲不但是中國歷史上的新頁，更是民主世界的大事，在南京的各國外交使節，在法國駐華大使梅理　（南京外交團首席大使）率領之下，都以欣慰的心情，穿上了大禮報到塲觀禮。法國是民主發源的國家，梅禮靈大使對於能參加觀禮，並且坐在外賓席的第一席，感到很榮幸，極口讚美民主在中國的發展。美國的司徒雷登大使則說這是空前的大事，國民大會是民主的機構，會給中國人民帶來好處。英國的施諦文大使連連說：　「好，當然好」，面將雕華返國的印度梅農大使更爲能在行前參加這盛會觀禮而欣慰，他緊緊握着記者的手。</p>
<p>「Woncerful！我快活極了，我希望中國的民主政權能努力獲致國家治平」。</p>
<p>第一屆國民大會開幕了，中國歷史之新頁已在世界注目下順利着筆，正莊重的寫下去，站在人民的立塲，我們祝福大會成功，因爲大會的成功便是人民的成功，中國歷史已開始另一新紀元。</p>

<h3 id="c16">社論　理知與意志的培養 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>昨天是第五屆靑年節，本市各界舉行盛會慶祝，情緒空前熱烈。凡是參加慶祝大會的人，沒有不把中國一切的希望，都寄托在靑年身上·但是我們冷靜下來想一想，却發現今日的靑年，很多表現徬徨不安的情緒和浮動紛亂的現象，而不易復見昔日革命奮鬥與抗戰期間熱誠勇毅的情神。我們雅不欲苛責靑年，却十二分的同情靑年的苦悶，因此我們極願乘此機會，一爲剖析其主要病源，並爲智識靑年進一言，希望全國的靑年從今天起，痛下決心，將精力專注於理知與意志的培養。蔣主席日昨發表吿全國靑年書，也說：『第一，靑年們應審思明辨，認淸國家敵人。靑年應當有熱烈的情感，同時應當有豐富的理知」</p>
<p>時代的矛盾與動亂，抗戰以後所發生的社會不安，對善威的靑年似乎是煩躁的主因。可是這些因素對社會各方面都是一樣的。放眼來看國際風雲的變幻，戰時瘡痍的未復，在西洋國家也有其不景氣。爲什麼中國智識靑年的苦悶焦躁的表現來午特別嚴重呢？</p>
<p>青年是特別富於情感，所以容易熱心，也容易失望；可與爲善以成事，也易於歧趨而橫決。在知識水準低，組織力薄弱的中國社會中，感情更容易奔放而不得其正。五四以後，靑年從舊禮敎解放出來，一股勇往蓬勃的熱精，的確有促進社會進步的效果。可是我們模擬歐美的新敎育，大抵偏重形式和「興趣」，而最忽視中國向來重視的「意志訓練」，也沒有盡到西洋文化自希臘以降所謂「愛智」「求眞」的傳統所鎔成的「理知培養」的工夫·因此，我們靑年的戚情是發揚了，却無從得到擴充和醇化。他們一遇生活不滿或阻力，威情失其寄託，便容易發生二種趨向：謹愿者因失望而消沉而頹廢，敏銳者因反感之較强而躁動而橫決。今日多數靑年的缺乏朝氣，和一部分靑年學生的妄動軼軌，基本的原因在此·</p>
<p>要挽回靑年的消沉徬徨，要避免他們的走入歧途，已不是法令，刑罰或形式的德行訓練的能爲力。我們必須在敎育上和靑年自我訓練上，致力於「理知」的培養和「意志」的鍛鍊。</p>
<p>先說理知的培養：中國今日的學校敎育，特一別是模襲歐美規制的大學敎育，原來是着重傳授理知的。大學導師制用意雖善，而至今效果不彰，近年許多敎育家多以爲現代大學的使命，只要以「理知」爲中心，而致疑於兼顧道德訓練。我們以爲中學階段如果必須顧到德行的訓練，以輔進知能的敎育，至於高等敎育苟能眞正貫澈「理知」的敎育，自然也足以完成整個的人格敎育，因爲盲從妄爲多由於未能明白事理：如果有眞知灼見，自能發爲大仁大勇。可是不幸正是道理知的訓練，　如運用思想，審愼抵判，和　辨是非的精神，在今日學校的門牆裏普遍的感到欠缺。往住由傳說而輕信，因輕信而妄動；或　　　和，或猶疑旁觀。我們前儒垂敎的窮理致知　夫，所謂「博學審問愼思明辨」，所着重正在「思」與「辨」；不幸今之智識靑年，最不善用理知來思想，來辨別。我們只看最近大學學潮的起因，往往是少數人有一套企圖的訓練，勇於生事，便能使多數人膽顧，怯於爲善。理知的思辨力混淆可說是敎育與社會環境棼亂的主因。靑年試想：國家政治的不上軌道，正由是非之辨未明；如果輕信的習慣，浮薄的態度，與攻訐毆辱的行爲，成爲智識靑年的風尙，那麼今後的政治如何淸明，民主如何實現？明乎此，靑年當知以「理知」植思辨之基的重要了。</p>
<p>其次，意志的銀練，是與理知的敎育相輔相成的。中國先哲敎人最重立志，所謂「持志」「勵志」，實在都是在見理旣明之後，加以堅定錘鍊的工夫。如果持志不堅，則只見當前現象，看不到遠處大處，經不起挫折，也便容易事敗垂成。歷史上多少偉人的建功立業，是得力於堅貞待後的寡母之敎：多少學者的斐然大成，是起於「窮而後工」的寒士攻苦；多少名將的却敵拓疆，是基於有進無退的剛毅精神：這却是意志可以發生偉大力量的明證。靑年年富力强，前程遠大，有理知植其基，必須用意志濟其功。凡是缺乏耐性而易於失望，缺乏恒心而一暴十寒，寬于責己而苛於責人，只知自好而無以利羣，都是知理雖明而意志不够的徵象。只有意志力最充實的靑年，才能免於消極，免於無恒，才能不做懦夫，不爲「鄕愿」，推之而能「見義勇爲」，不難達成「富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈」的境界。</p>
<p>我們分析今日知識靑年的不安情緒，自然不能忽略時代的因素。可是已往敎育，模襲英美，只解放了靑年的感情；灌輸知識，又未能疑鍊其思辦的工夫，實在有重大的關係。惟有明理知才能導靑年感情于正軌，惟有勵意志才鎔鑄靑年的情理而達于力行。今後補偏救弊的工作，有待于一般敎育家的努力；但是力爭上游，盡其在我，有爲的靑年必不願怨天尤人，而能檢省得失，從「明理」和「勵志」個方向痛下工夫。</p>
<p>、知者不惑，仁者不憂，勇者不懼。仁是先儒道德修養的全人境界，知與勇至少是我們靑年所可學而幾的·處今日變亂的世局，謀所以自立報國之道，我們必須深植理知，自不爲紛紜的現象所淆惑：確立意志，自不怕一切外力的威脅。不惑不懼，自有處紛的定識，應變的定力，更何甩于煩悶和憂惶？</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕國大新聞組息：蔣主席廿九日晨在第一屆國民大會第一次會議開幕禮致詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>今天我們第一屆民大會開會，各位來自各地，受着全國選民的付託，行使憲法所賦與的職權，這是我們中華民國實行民主憲政的開始，也是國父領導國民革命五十餘年犧牲奮鬥，以求達到的目標，今天的　會，不僅是中華民國建國史上的一件大事，眞是我們中國有史以來，劃時代的一件大事，中正得以參加這一個神聖莊嚴的慶典，深感無限的欣慰。</p>
<p>珍視憲法價值　芟除民主障碍</p>
<p>國民革命的目的，在拯救中國於危亡，求得中國的自由平等，建設中國爲民有，民治，民享的三民主義的共和國，這也就是今夭各位代表共同的責任，國父嘗言「所謂民國者，不務民國之名，當務主權在民之實」。國父又言「三民主義的意思，就是民治·民有·民享·國家是人民所共有，政治是人民所共管，利益是人民所共事」，爲要澈底實現這個偉大的理想，所以有建國大綱的訂立，喚起全國國民，來共同奮鬥。但是民國成立三十七年來，內憂外患紛起迭乘，其初有帝制餘孽，北洋軍閥的竊國，隨後有日本帝國主義者的侵略，到了抗戰勝利，又遭遇了蓄意顚覆民國，實行「暴民」專政的共匪叛亂，這些反動勢力，無不是出其全力，來阻礙我們民主憲政的實施，我們的一部革命建國史，可說是充滿了困苦艱難的犧牲奮鬥史。我們去年頒行的中華民國憲法，可以說是血淚凝成的結晶，我們在過去，已經衝破了層層的阻力，克服了種種的困難，來產生這一部憲法，我們在今後更必須珍視憲法的價値，芟除民主的障礙，保障憲政的成功</p>
<p>不重條文美好　而在圓滿實行</p>
<p>世界各國的憲政，無不是逐漸發展，逐漸改進，逐漸充實而達到完全的境界，憲法不重在條文的美好，而重在圓滿的實行。我們中華民國的憲法，主要的可分爲三大部份：第一是人民的權利義務，第二是國家的政治組織，第三是國家的基本政策。這三部份，也就是民有，民治，民亨的內容，惟有人民有行使政權的能力和習慣，能了解人民權利與自由的可貴，能善盡國民對於國家的義務，而後國家基礎得有確實的保障，國家乃始成爲人民所有的國家。唯有人民與政府之間，建立起密切　滿的關係，使人民有權，政府有能，共同遵循憲法的軌轍，而後國家的政治組織，乃能發揮他應着的功能，成爲推進國策的工具。也唯有依照全體人民與整個國家的利益，而訂定基本國策，而後全國人民乃能努力追求共同的理想，以來取進步與繁榮。這三大部份，實在是密切相關，而不可分的。世界各國的憲政發展史，證明了政治的民主，離不開國家的獨立，也障不開人民的幸福。就我們中國來說，民權主義的基礎，在於民族，民權主義的目的，在於民生，中國一部民主運動史，是首先爭取國家民族的獨立平等，而終極的歸趨，則在於保障人民的權利，充裕人民的生活。各位如果把握了這個要點，來體認我國憲政的前途，就可發現我們行憲以後的政治措施，必須以實現基本國策爲目標，必須以增進全體人民的生活爲前提，亦必須以保障民族生存，與　　國家基礎爲前提。</p>
<p>保障憲政成功　必須悉力戡亂</p>
<p>依照國父鷄　大綱的規定，憲法頒布以後　舉行全國大選舉，國民政府則授政於民選之政府，是爲建國之大功吿成。但是我們今天的行憲，就經濟建設來說，　　會建設來說，就文化敎育的建設來說，祗能說建國工作從社有基本，國策爲準繩，可以作更進一步的努力，還不能說是建國已吿成功。各位代表選民，來自各地，必能認淸我們建國最大的障礙是什麼，我們民主憲政最大的障礙是什麼。自從抗戰勝利，我們就努力於復員和建設，而共匪則到處破壞，到處阻撓；我們同時積極準備召開國民大會，和制憲的工作，而共匪則始而牽制，繼而拒絕終至公開叛亂。到了去年，我們頒布憲法以後，共匪更認爲中國一旦實行了民主憲政，他就無法實行其出賣國家，危害民族的所謂階級專政，於是他悍然反對憲法，反對行憲國民大會，他甘心做民主的敵人作國家的敵人，而展開更瘋在的武裝叛變，更兇殘的屠戳毀滅。我們今天開始行憲，要爲國家策久遠的安全，而共匪所要的是混亂，我們要保障人民的生活，和民族的生存，而共匪所要製造的，則是飢餓貧窮與滅亡。因此，我認爲今天國家和人民戡亂與行憲應該同等重視。我們不因戡亂而延緩憲政的實施，反之，我們正因爲要保障憲政的成功，不能不悉力戡亂，以剷除這個建國的障碍，與民主的敵人。各位代表們，省察國家現實的形勢，定必有同樣深刻的認職。</p>
<p>此次大會使命　在行使選舉權</p>
<p>這次國民大會，是行憲的第一屆大會，憲法甫吿施行，利弊得失之所在，還沒有具體的經騐可供修改的參考。因之，大會的使命，只是行使選舉權，以完成中華民國政府的組織。依據我們憲法的精神，憲政政府的職責，在保障人民自由，執行基本國策，其最重大的任務，尤在於維護我民主共和國體保持國家主權，恢復領土完整。代表諸君，在大會中行使職權，每一代表所投神聖的一票，都是代表我中華民國國民，把保障人民自由，執行基本國策的責任，以及維護民主共和國體，保持國家主權的責任，交託於憲政政府。同時，也就是要把劃除民主障碍，消弭建國的阻力的責任，交託於憲政政府。今天的戡亂，乃是民主憲政，對暴民專政的戰爭也就是救國對賣國，救民對害民的戰爭。處在這樣嚴重的時機，又値行憲開始的時候，全國人民，與憲政政府的責任，都是特別的重大。深望代表諸君，體念國家與人民真正的需要，忠實表達人民的意志，鄭重行使憲法所賦與的職權，爲憲政開始樹立良好的規模。謹祝大會成功。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿九日航訊〕李宗仁將軍參加副總統競選，可以算是一支先鋒隊，因為當南京的黨派間還在折衝着國大代表的名額問題的談判時，我們就獲得了北國傳來的消自—李將軍公開發表參加競選副總</p>
<p>李將軍首先宣布競選，正表現他豪爽的英雄氣概。不過李將軍說：「我爲什麼公開得這麼早？遺是對民主政治的一種倡導。我想因此而造成民主風氣。至於成敗，那到是另外一回事。」李將軍顯然有着政治家的風度，他還說成敗不計理所當然，競選有如打籃球，勝敗是必然的事，投籃有中亦必有不中。這種豁達的胸襟不是一天可以養成的。</p>
<p>李將軍是挂篇的能將，當年廣西三自政策的推行，使廣西從完全求人做到不求人的境况。這推行三自政策的首腦就是當時所謂三傑，也就是李將軍和現任國防部白部長以及現仍留治桂省的黃旭初，他們三位一體，力求軍政民的配合，李將軍不是一個純粹的軍人，在這裏可以說明。同時，李將軍也以此爲號召。他說他雖是軍人可是能政，他關心政治，他瞭解政治，他也有對政治雄心。所以有人說大總統是軍人，副總統應該是文人，似乎李將軍應該是不合於這個條件的，可是他却一是個文武兼備的人才。再說有人拿地域來分，說是總統是南方人，副總統廠該是北方人，李將軍偏偏又是南方人，可是李將軍拿事實做說明，他說他雖爲南方人，可是這次主持北平行轅，在北平也留了兩年。再說他本人本無地域觀念。</p>
<p>他不僅關心政治，而且對政治有相當研究，在北平時，他早就注意研究當前政治弊病。自平飛滬，就發表了他改革政治的意見。一到南京，首次與記者見面時，也就談到這個問題。他的看法是這樣：「國家弄到現在這步田地，我們還不能把病人的病源找出來治療，難道看着他等死嗎」？他又肯定的說：「我有我的看法，有我所研究所觀察的心得，並且必將新的意見貢獻給新的政府。」</p>
<p>假如我要批評李將軍，我可以說一句：「李將軍貌不驚人」他身材臉相等等似乎够得上說中平，你沒有發覺他有什麼超人的神色。就如說話，他的聲浪也是那麼輕而細，一口廣西官話，你慢慢的聽，就會很簡單的聽懂了。他從來不出言　座。可是李將軍就在平凡中求得了不平凡。</p>
<p>李將軍參加競選，實力是相當可觀的，他收了南北呼應之效。你看李將軍的消息一經宣布，各地政黨擁護的，不是從北方開始嗎？北方同胞對他的擁戴，尤其說明了他洽政的收穫，更說明了他雖是南方人而爲北方人治事，是沒有什麼不合宜的；因此我說，李將軍的問題，似乎是不成問題的問題。李將軍雄厚的競選力量，我看即如他自己所指的年高德劭的人也未必一定如他。</p>

<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿八日電〕蘇聯陸軍機關「紅星」報與海軍機關「紅艦隊」報，今日指責瑞典軍事當局擬建築基地，供美國飛機應用，並謂戰　集團正謀控制瑞典政府。「紅艦隊」報載評論家塞米諾夫一文稱：瑞典陸軍總司令容格正擬利用瑞取軍隊，作爲美國軍事機構之附庸，並使瑞典之外交政策隸屬於美國在北歐之擴張野心。容格之計劃，擬（一）在瑞典北部建築新防禦工事及飛機塲，以供美國飛機及降落傘部隊之用。（二）將瑞典空軍包括在美國空軍制度內。（三）根據美國軍略物資之進口，動員工業。（四）增加有訓練之軍官與美式武器之士兵。蘇聯消息報昨亦指斥挪威擬以軍事基地租與美英，値茲芬闌與蘇聯談判友好條約之際，足見蘇聯對北歐局勢之重視。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美參議員范登儀及國務部深懼與蘇貿戰加劇，可能危害歐洲復興計劃，對於此事極爲焦慮。此項焦慮，係根據此項信念而生，即美國將飛機引擎運入蘇聯，國會方面之反響足以引起衆院積極採取行動，取消與鐵幕後國家作賣買之西歐國家間之援助。參院領袖與國務部官員最爲焦慮者，係衆院議員孟德所提出對衆院外委會法案之修正。</p>
<p>該修正案命令主持外援案官員，對任何以戰時有價値物資運蘇或其附庸國之西歐國家，皆取消其美國所予之援助。衆院三十日開始審查其合併援外案中之修正案，預料於卅一日將舉行表決，通過該案。衆院領袖預料該案將以三對一之壓倒多數通過之，隨後該案將送交參衆兩院之聯席會議，調整其歧異之點。參院之法案祇限於歐洲復興案，而衆院之法案則包括歐洲復興案。經濟援華案。軍事援助希土及中國案。范登堡及國務部皆曾公開表示，謂恢復戰前蘇聯與西歐貿易，係馬歇爾計劃成功之基本前提。但渠等稱，此項重要假定，係此項貿易必須無在政治上爲蘇聯支配之意義在內。共和黨外交政策領袖范登堡激烈反對有戰潛力之物資運穌，但渠與負責歐洲復興計劃之大員意見相同，認爲美國出口統制上之缺點，不應在修正案中列入限制條款來加以補救。范登堡對於恢復東西貿易之立塲，係三月一日在參院發表，渠稱，「歐洲東西貿易之交流，係對雙方必要者，該項貿易之恢復將對雙方有利，在歐洲復興案中並無何項阻止貿易恢復之事。」國務部對此事之主張，較此尤甚。在一項提交參院外委會之報吿書中，國務部力稱，關於恢復歐洲東西兩部之貿易，業已在草擬一項長期計劃。無此項貿易，歐洲經濟復興將更遲緩與更困難，但並非係一不能達成之事。」</p>

<p>— （本報駐吧城特約記者黃澆震）</p>
<p>日寇投降迄今，快滿三年了。二三年來，東印度的僑胞，飽嘗了戰亂喪亡，流離顚連的生活。自從和平之船「雷維爾」號從美國不遠萬里來到爪哇海上，於去年十二月十印荷開始談判，經過了峯迴路轉，一波三折的路道，絞盡了各國政界人士的腦汁，終於本年一月十七日簽訂了休戰協定，和接受了政治談判的原則。化干戈爲玉帛，轉戾氣爲祥和。中華民族的海外孤兒，目覩此邦擾攘經年，僑胞們無辜受禍，今一旦印荷雙方獲得和平合理的解決，多少人不由自主的喜極而悲，感懷欲泣呢！</p>
<p>我們知道，印荷談判的成功，於荷方言，無疑的在軍事或政治上隱然居於壓倒的優勢。荷蘭區共和軍之遺送工作，已於本年地二月廿二晚結束，被遣送之部隊，總計二萬九千人，今後荷蘭區治安可望無慮，衝突襲擊或可望减少，聯邦政府經於本月九日正式成立·這些事實說明，停戰協定的執行，大致是一帆風順的。</p>
<p>在僑胞身上打算盤</p>
<p>荷蘭對印尼政治軍事大功吿成以後，今復轉移目光，在我們華僑身上打算盤了。換言之，荷方政治攻勢成功後，另展開經濟攻勢，這攻勢是有意針對我們僑商的。</p>
<p>我們僑商創業海外，謀生異域，六率憑其超人之勞力，或倚仗個人的手腕，而無祖國政府之保護，且疊受當地政府之壓迫。自經過日寇三年半之搜括刧掠，加之以二年來印尼獨立運動，兵慌馬亂的結果，我們華僑的經濟機構，幾站在破產的邊緣。華商自己亦逐漸明瞭，他們的「黃金時代」已漸過去，但對於應付新情况的經濟攻勢，却一直在徬徨。去歲僑商和農產販賣局的糾紛，未獲合理之解決，現在荷印經濟部，却又展開了第二次的攻勢。</p>
<p>荷蘭壟斷輸人貿易</p>
<p>根據荷局當局的理由，限制自由貿易的主要目的，是在根絕走私，及防止資金逃避。我們細察其動機，實由於荷蘭洋行五大巨頭存心壟斷操縱一切輸入貿易而演出的把戲。戰後荷蘭財政支絀，外匯枯竭，此種苦况，我們相當明瞭。由於外匯拮据而採取必要的步驟，原未可厚非。不過，若一口咬定說荷幣在星洲香港貶値，是僑商走私誘致的結果，這種故入人罪的怪論，我們是無論如何不能承認的。事實很明顯，荷幣貶値重要的因素，由於荷屬東印度土產的輸出遭受了嚴格的限制，不能爭取海外市塲，而轍出銳减的原因，無疑的是受時局動盪的影饗。</p>
<p>華僑在南洋一向是最安分守法的，現在有極少數的僑商，因爲得不到外匯，無法從事正常經營，才要做走私的勾當。如果能够恢復較前狀態，走私之風定趨消滅，同時我們知道，這些資金外流，並不是一去不返。事實上荷政府對華商照例是不發給外匯的，而星洲香港的舶來品，由華商一批一批的運入荷印，繁榮此間市塲，這說明了逃出的是資金，流進的是貨物。僅僅過去一年，據海關粗略的統計，關稅收入約六千萬盾，不正當的貿易是無法統計的。即以百分之十來計算，自由貿易的關稅，也就相當可觀了。</p>
<p>經濟統制造成流幣</p>
<p>荷蘭經濟部雖一再申明，限制輸入不渦是限制奢侈品，並不是限制日常用品，但二者之間　綫　難劃淸。我們姑勿論蔲丹·胭脂·口紅，單談日常用品吧，牙膏·滑粉·香皂·小鏡·骨梳·髮油入口時一律踝稅三十巴仙，祇有面巾浴巾視作棉織品，被徵收十巴仙。這樣看來，日常用品與奢侈品幾混淆不淸。如果徵收三十巴仙的日常用品，即目之爲奢侈品，那末，隨便開一間百貨商店，「奢侈品」最低限度佔七十巴仙以上。</p>
<p>自從荷印淪陷後，所有戰前囤積的物資，經過日寇三年半的消耗，所餘究屬有限，顯然不能供給市民的需求。過去配給局的輸入，由于外匯的限制，同樣也不能滿足市民之急需。如今我們僑商不必動用外匯，而輸入大批民間的必需品，繁榮此間市塲，揆之情理，此種貿易似不應加以嚴格的限制。政府當局現雖仍有配給，但杯水車薪，無濟於事。譬如布匹，如果市民僅仰仗配給，恐怕早已襤褸不堪；再如苛性蘇打，假使單靠復興工業局配給，也許小工業早已關門大吉了。其他日常用品的輸入，幾平全是黑市輸入，流通這裏的市塲。</p>
<p>在非常時期，經濟統制固有必要，它的目的在謀大多數人的福利，確保社會的安寗。但流弊所及，往往是與民爭利，甚或少數人坐亨其利結果民困未蘇，已怨聲載道，此爲統制政策所應避免的</p>
<p>提高警覺適應潮流</p>
<p>記者目覩南洋荷印僑胞慘罹兵燹之餘，又復遭受當地政府之無情打擊，所以特別對僑胞寄予無限的同情。記者希望僑胞應從速提高警覺，促成大團結，必需要有一種新的姿態，一種嚴密的組織，來發展和保護華僑固有的地位。我們深深知道，現在時代不同，經濟情形根本改變，在國家盛行統制，私人活動輙受限制，在社會則羣力合作，個體經營不堪壓逼，衡諸過去現在華僑生活方式與經營辦法，殆不免有時代落伍，環境難容之感。如果不及早努力自求進步，以期因應潮流，迎頭趕上，則此後天然淘汰之時機一來，勢將徬徨莫知所措，此又記者盱衡世變，遠測未來，所願對各地僑胞（尤其是在荷印的僑胞）致其誠懇，喚起注意者也。（卅七年，三月十八日吧城航訊）</p>

<p>〔路透社普拉格廿八日電〕捷克內閣總理戈德華今日表示，第三次世界大戰決不致發生，因爲蘇聯領導的和平勢力如此强大，任何人如敢發動新戰爭，將爲其本國人民所毀棄。戈德華係以捷克共產黨主席身份，向普拉格區共黨會議致辭，他說，最近捷克事件已對閉了自史丹丁直達特里埃斯特一綫上的裂口，此舉對於西方的勞工階級將有相當影響。他們的力量不可予以低估。戈氏繼日，二月間之成功，多應歸功於共產黨之地方團體，猶憶在一九四五年捷克甫獲解放之後，由於布爾喬亞階級在捷古國內之未來任務尙未充份了解，故使布爾喬亞仍保持一部份的物質佔有及政治權利。今反動勢力已完全被擊敗，除少數誤入迷途的學生外，已無人再反動份子的計劃奮鬥，大多數農民亦已參加工人，今後任務在加緊實行社會主義。由於反動份子之尙未在實體上被毀滅，及吾人之不擬在實體上加以破毀，故共產黨人仍須隨時戒備。在五月卅一日之選舉以前，政府之計劃包括憲法等將予施行，國營措施將成為法律。二月革命之政治後果，將有系統的趨於實現，整肅運動將使反動份子不能再獲優勢，然整肅運動中之若干錯誤亦必須予以糾正。戈氏復日，東方及東南方均以滿意愉快之心情，迎接捷克事件之消息，西方之反動勢力雖正咬牙裂齒，但英法義之勞工將因此而得獲更大的自信。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京廿九日電〕美國陸軍部病理學家即原子彈損害調查委員會主席泰斯梅今日發表報吿書稱，根據長期實地研究廣島轟炸影響結果，該地完全缺乏比基尼礁湖靶子艦上遺留之危險性輻射能。比基尼第二次原子彈爆炸試驗係在水面下舉行，以致產生一種殘餘輜射能。廣島與長崎轟炸及比基尼第一次試騐均在空中，並無足以引起疾疫之殘餘輻射能存在。</p>
<p>廣島港內船隻與飲水亦未受輻射影響，換言之，自開始爆炸之一剎那起，並無任何其他損害之證據。關於此點，全國研究委員會奧文博士意見亦同。蓋原子彈爆炸後，即生無數分裂性物質，非肉眼所能見及。此種分裂性物質在一千八百呎之高空迅即被風吹散，結果與水下爆炸完全不同。水下爆炸時，分裂性物質並不散開，反而集中，形成濃霧，附着于船身，殘餘輻射能因之存在。殘餘輻射能可保持甚久而不消失，比基尼島靶子艦最近始吿沉沒，其故在此。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕首屆行憲國民大會，昨日在京隆重開幕，適逢第五屆靑年節，本市各機關，銀行，學校，工廠及各業市塲等，均休假一天，以誌慶祝，宿雨初晴，陽光普照，全市國旗飄揚，情况至為熱烈·各界除於上午攸市體育館聯合舉行盛大慶祝儀式外，並在靑年館及體育館，分別舉行演講，集團結婚，及體育等活動。各電影院均加映早塲，半價優待。各書店亦一律减價，優待靑年學生。靑年運動委員會並於下午七時，假育才中學舉行靑年聯誼會，有各項精彩遊藝，參加靑年至爲踴躍。</p>
<p>本市各界慶祝國民大會開幕及第五屆靑年　曁紀念革命先烈大會於昨晨九時在體育館舉行。到各界人士二千餘人，靑年學生參加大會者尤爲衆多。首由主席吳市長致詞，略謂：「今日國民大會在京開幕，又爲第五屆靑年節，連旬陰雨，條爾放晴，殊可象徵中國前途豁然開朗，光明無限。害人希望中國達到眞正之和平民主，其基礎乃在全國靑年，今日紀念靑年節，尤有深長意義，吾人環顧世界，民主陣綫與共產陣綫壁壘日益分明，靑年參加何方，以其明智認識，自當知所適從。共產主義爲少數階級之獨裁政治，無自由之可言，民主政治則以大多數人民意旨爲依歸，正爲人民自由而努力。此次自殺之捷克外長，乃捷克首任大總統之子，渠爲維護眞正之民主自由，死前曾赴其亡父幕前痛哭，不惜以生命殉信仰，此種精神，至堪欽仰。共黨獨裁專政下，無新聞集會等各稱自由之可言，吾人爲發揚民主自由眞諦，必須首先打倒共黨。希特勒曾謂：「造謠一遍又一遍，千萬遍造謠，乃變成事實」。共黨之陰謀造謠，蓋亦類此」·市長繼即追述「同濟學潮」對少數陰謀份子慕後操縱暴動之事實，詳加揭發，最後堅決表示稱，「吾人今日祇有兩條路，必須於「民主」及「共產」中選擇一條，吾人要眞正之和平民主，祗有發揚三民主義，打倒共產主義。本人決不辭任何犧牲，爲此一目標而努力，希望靑年羣起響應，奠定民主中國之基石」。</p>

<p>曹俊闡明　青年節意義</p>
<p>旋由市黨部副主委曹俊致詞，略謂：「當前國內種種情勢，無論政治，軍事，經濟，均尙在艱苦階段中，吾人未能滿意，亦毋庸諱言，惟吾人深信光明前一刻爲最黑階之一刻，吾人必須以加倍之警惕及忍耐，度過黎明前夕。今目又爲靑年節及黃花崗烈十殉難紀念，中華民國之締造，實乃黃化崗先烈及無數志士流血犧牲之　果，各烈士當獻身革命時，十儿爲靑年學生。繼起靑年羣，秉承先烈精神，自北伐迄抗戰，紛爲前驅之中堅戰士，舉國振奮，卒獲最後勝利，國府明令定今日爲「靑年節」，乃有無限深刻之意義。惟自勝利以來，靑年層組織工作，頗嫌不够，致爲共黨陰謀份子所乘，利用靑年羣衆，以冀實現其野心，此在最近所獲共匪文件中，已有確緊之證據。吾人必須針對此點，加强靑年力量，予共匪陰謀以致命打擊」。</p>
<p>錢劍秋致詞</p>
<p>再次由婦女代表錢劍秋致詞，渠闡述三點：（一）今日爲黃花崗烈十殉難紀念日，吾人必須繼承黃花崗先烈之革命神精，幷發揚光大之。（二）國民大會今日在京開幕，吾人必須以革命精神發揚三民主義，爲憲政而勢力。（三）今日又爲第五屆靑年節，吾人應喚起靑年，揭發共匪禍國陰謀，爲全民謀幸福。渠幷申述昨日所發表之主席文吿，關明民主政治係以最多數人民之意旨，爲最多數人民謀福利，順於天理，合乎潮流，相信民主及共產之鬥爭中，民主政治必能擊敗以最少數人意旨爲最少數人謀利益之共產獨裁政治，獲致最後勝利。</p>
<p>學生代表致詞</p>
<p>最後由靑年學生代表致詞，渠表示：「當前局勢，必先求國家之安定，今日政府召開國大，開始憲政，實爲安定國家之開始，希望靑年羣加强團結，發揮最大力量，協助政府，爲促進憲政而努力」。紀念儀式於十一時半在烈口號聲中完成，　即開始中華口　會之餘興節目，迄中午散會。</p>

<p>〔本報　寫〕某小姐受過高深的敎育，本身也有才幹，在學校中的時候更口口聲聲要獻身社會，服務人羣，可是當她踏進社會不到兩年的時間，就已捨棄了職業，熄滅了理想，將她的學問才幹都埋沒在家庭裏，原來她已經做了孩子的媽媽了。　像這一種例子，在我們週圍接觸到的親戚朋友同事中間，所看到與聽到的實在太多了。對於大多數職業婦女們，結婚後孩子的誕生，無異是職業生命的喪鐘，但餘非她們願意違反人性，而以老處女終其身，她們就無法　免這必來的阻礙，這眞是職業婦女們　大的悲　與苦悶。</p>
<p>在世界有些國家裏，這一種苦悶早已賴托兒所的普遍設立而解決。但在我們中國，托兒所這名詞對於大多數人恐怕還很陌生，托兒事業還剛剛在不受重視的情形下萌芽發軔。</p>
<p>為了孩子健康要担多少風險</p>
<p>上海市內現有的托兒所，據最近統計共二十六家，其中以職業婦女爲對象的八家，以職工婦女爲對象的五家，工廠的哺乳室十二家。受托的兒童共一千五百餘人，年齡從五個月至六歲不等。這些托兒所中，大多數僅是日間寄托，與幼稚園的性質差不多，日夜寄託的僅有江　路的職業婦女托兒所，威海　路的女靑年會托兒所，金神父路的上海托兒所，以及狄思威路的幼幼托兒所等數家。</p>
<p>「辦托兒所是一件吃力不討好的工作，爲孩子們的健康要担多少風險，保育得好，家長最多笑一笑謝一聲，但如果孩子稍有一點小痛小癢，家長們就會向所方責問，甚至大興其問罪之師。」這是職業婦女託兒所主任徐靜之女士對記者的訴苦。</p>
<p>起先澘然淚下　後來破涕為笑</p>
<p>「因此之故」，她又說，「所方每星期要請醫生替孩子們檢查三次，每天另外請護士替他們測量溫度　如果稍有一點熱度，立刻就通知他們的家　或者設法醫療。把孩子寄進托兒所來的家長有的是職業婦女，有的是離婚的夫婦，也有是私生子的父母，孩子們剛剛送進來時不免啼哭吵鬧，這時候就需要保姆與敎員的耐心誘導。有些父母因爲萬不得已才把孩子送進托兒所，他們起先往往戀戀不捨，甚至有澘然淚下的，後來看到孩子在托兒所中生活得還不差，這才放下心來，破涕爲笑了。」</p>
<p>收容最多一家　共有一百餘人</p>
<p>職業婦女托兒所是現在收容孩子最多的一家托兒所，但一共也祇有一百多人，分爲三組，自五足月至一歲的編入幼嬰園，一歲至四歲的編入幼幼園，四歲至六歲的編入幼稚園。幼嬰園兒童施以人工哺乳，幼稚園與幼幼園兒童每日吃點心兩頓，飯三頓。幼稚園除保育以外，還施以幼稚教育。孩子們在一起渦集團生活，天眞的活動與無邪的笑聲成爲工作者安慰的泉源。</p>
<p>目前各托兒所最大的困難是經費與房屋不够。因爲職業婦女負担力薄弱，加之物價日漲，收入不足以維持開支，政府方面又因本身財政困難而無力顧及，所以現有的托兒所都是使具雛形而已。像別的國家那樣大規模托兒所的普遍設立，似乎尙有待於相當時候，才能實現呢。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市最近發生一商人被强迫幽禁於瘋人醫院之案件，其情節之複雜，實屬駭人聽聞。受害人爲一無錫人，於護得自由後已向無錫旅滬同鄉會伸寃，昨日同鄉會特招待新聞界呼籲主持公道，並由此行動正常之「瘋人」親述受害經過。茲將詳情誌後：</p>
<p>無錫人嚴培興，現年四十二歲，在滬開設華興紡織五金製造廠，娶妻　　央，現年四十四歲，兩人結婚十八年，平日夫婦不睦，而嚴生性懦弱，每每忍氣吞聲。三十四年間某日，嚴因積　過甚，曾在便條上　書「我如做了皇帝，就可以殺妻子」，數字，此字條旋爲其妻取得後收藏·至去年年底，嚴又與其妻爲女兒婚配事意見不合，因兩人膝下無兒，僅育兩女，其妻擬將大女兒許配與內姪，嚴則反對，因此雙方情感更</p>
<p>形同冰炭</p>
<p>去年農曆十二月二十九日（小除夕）上午十時許，嚴在河南北路業興紡織五金製造廠總發行所，突有穿軍服携武器不佩符號之軍人及便衣者共五六人侵入，自稱接收房屋，一面强推其出外，一面將門加鎖，嚴無力與抗，乃至中正西路華興紗管廠暫避，嗣因河南北路總發行所內有儲存大宗貨物（織布梭十等大小三四十箱），故於當晚十時許前往察看，則見門內</p>
<p>燈光輝煌</p>
<p>其妻袁寳英及內姪袁祥徵等，正在屋內私搬貨物。彼等聞嚴聲音即從後門四散奔逃。翌日（即大除夕）下午四時許，嚴正在總發行所樓上辦公之際，該衣軍服持械者五六人，突又侵入，同時親聞其妻袁寳英在樓下發言之聲，未幾即被押登汽車直駛顓橋普慈醫院，以瘋人爲由，强迫入院。進院之後，據嚴培興追述，當時院方並未先予檢驗，而即由醫師汪射</p>
<p>麻醉針劑</p>
<p>八次之多。嚴當時曾與抗拒，致將內衣撕破，後來被用鐐銬將雙手銬住，幽禁於四號病室內。昨日嚴將撕破之內衣與手上之鐐痕出示，並稱：依照瘋人醫院之規例，收容瘋人須有衛生局之證明，但彼則根本未曾至衛生局檢驗。嚴入院忽忽月餘，至最近始得機會寫信與其族姪等設法營救，乃由其胞妹向警備司令部稽查處吿發，經該處派員於本月二十六日至醫院提出訊問後，准予</p>
<p>交保出外</p>
<p>嚴一而自投仁濟，怡和兩醫院檢騐證明並無精神異常，一面因恐再被送進瘋人院，乃赴無錫旅滬同鄕會請求援助保護，同時因其本人之岡章文件賬册等於事前均被其妻取去，其畢生心血創辦之華興紡織五金製造廠，已更名爲東南紡織五金製造廠，故已延請律師將進行法律訴訟。據其親屬及同鄉會中人談稱：此事表面上爲其妻覬覦財產而起，幕後則另有主使策劃之人云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕戰後新興工業國煉火油工廠，前曾一度被當局取締，後經油脂公會一再向各方請願，釋明國煉火油工業之存在非特有助燃料之供應及價格之抑平，亦且節省外匯，確爲民生必需而對國家經濟有利之工業，乃邀當局准許繼續經營，並博得經濟部同情，允予扶植，飭轍入管理委員會配給柴油原料，曾經油脂業同業公會，申請核配，該會亦曾覆示辦法二項：（一）各提煉火油廠應按照一般工廠登記辦法辦理。（二）登記範圍，以向經濟部登記合格。領有註册證書經常開工者爲標準。該業各工廠即邀此兩項辦法分別辦妥登記手續。惟輸管會油配會始終以柴油輸入有限，不數分配爲詞，不予配給。該業認為其他工廠燃料尙有煤斤可資代替，而提煉火油非柴油不可，若當局不予配給，國煉火油廠即無法生存。昨據該業公會負責人表示：各主管機關對於國煉火油業應配給柴油一節，均認爲必需，即輸管會亦未加否認，但實際上則迄未獲得核配。現同業爲本身生存計，將再度向主管機關請願，爭取柴油配給</p>

<h3 id="c104">華樂煤礦　開掘新井恢復生產 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>〔本報　縣廿五日航訊〕在接近戰地的煤礦中，賈汪的華東煤礦有很幸運的遭遇。在日僞時代，雖然開採得凶，近乎竭澤而漁，但是絲毫沒有受到直接的破壞、相反的，却添了設備和房屋。在兩年的戡亂軍事中，匪軍成了職業的煤礦破壞家，離開賈汪不遠的嶧縣中興煤礦，平時擁有每天二萬噸的產量，於遭受摧殘之後，迄今尙未恢復生產，可是賈汪在接收之後，竟能逐漸的恢復產量，一次也沒有受到戰爭的破壞。到現在，居然還在</p>
<p>開掘新井</p>
<p>作遠期的打算。還在一片破壞聲中，是多麼令人興奮的事蹟。</p>
<p>煤礦地跨蘇豫兩省，位於銅山縣（蘇）滕嶧（魯）三縣犬牙交錯的地帶，到現在爲止。江蘇和山東兩省的省府還在爭執這煤礦的隸屬問題，理由很明顯，大家都把它當作一個可靠的稅源。</p>
<p>礦的歷史不算短，光綌二十四年，即由江穌人胡碧　創辦，定名爲買汪煤礦公司。民國十六年時，改名爲上海　記公司。民十七年，產權轉移於華東公司，純爲商股。在實汪區的礦藏，因採完廢棄，現在開採的夏　礦區，爲山東膝縣夏橋　所管轄，在抗戰之前，已有相當的規模。礦區的全面積，共爲十五萬四千三百四十九公畝，煤田分佈甚廣，蘊藏量據鑽探的記錄，估計在八千萬噸以上。礦上的基本設備供全，且有附設的小型麵粉廠肥皂廠自來水電網等。在遝轉設備上，買汪至柳泉之間，敷有輕便鐵路十餘公里，專作運煤之用。</p>
<p>在賈汪車站遠眺華東煤礦，可以看見一排排整齊而小巧的紅色建築物，那是工人住屋也是日人佔領煤礦的遺跡。說句公道話，日本人對於蘇　一帶，在戰時曾有過一番建設的努力。他們嘗夢想過以徐州爲核心，開發整個的華東。所以在徐州一地，就開出了闊大的馬路，建立一百家以上的工廠，在徐州外圍各地，亦多多少少的做了些建設工作。以華東煤礦而論，日本人把　汪柳泉間的輕便鐵路放寬，使與津浦鐵路相啣接。地面的房屋建築，亦有相當增加。並在礦塲上，開設斜井兩處，因爲勝利來臨得比預期早，都沒有完工。在抗戰八年之中，日本人在華東煤礦共開採了二百四十餘萬噸的煤斤，同時因爲開採得太凶，影響到煤井下各重要巷道和井身的保固年齡，因此將來滬棄於地下無法開採的煤斤，估計在三百萬噸以上。這是日本對華東煤礦所欠的一筆賬，今天煤礦公司要求配給日本賠償物資中的設備，是極有根據的。　華東煤礦的戰前產量，每日在一千五百噸左右。敵僞時代，一度開採到每日兩千噸，以後自動减縮，最低時一天僅有三五十噸，平均約爲三百噸左右。經公司正式接收後，窰木一根也沒有，油料亦極感缺乏。兩年來的</p>
<p>整頓努力</p>
<p>現在每天已有兩千噸的生產。除自用之外，全部由燃管會收購，主要作爲津浦隴海兩路的燃料。在各地普遍煤荒之今日，每月六萬噸的供應，亦有其不可忽視的經濟價値。煤礦公司目前正在樍極進行開　新井的計劃，新井的地點在韓塲，目前已開坻第二層煤，經化驗結果，煤質優良。記者爲好奇心所驅使，在泥濘的荒地上步行數里，視察開掘新并的工程。空地上到處是蓆席棚，一邊堆滿了石塊。我鑽進一個　席棚，看一個新井正在聞掘，工作機正在離地面百公尺下面工作，工程師和工人是用大吊埇放下去的，肉眼向下望，只能看見　眼的電光在寒氣水氣中閃爍。工程師是穿了雨衣和皮靴下去的，出來時混身是水，好像在大雨中　過一樣。這眞是艱苦踏實　　創工作。公司某負責人表示：「每天用於開掘新井的費用，目　已在二十億以上，將來物價波　，一定不止此數。如果局面一有　　，一切均可化爲烏有，所　　是冒險的投資。」如果沒有　外新井於本年年底，可正式出　，以後新舊兩區每日</p>
<p>煤產總量</p>
<p>將在五千噸左右。在北煤南運困難之今日，不失爲一個喜訊　華東煤礦的工作人員，據記者個人的印象，均幹練稱職，對於本身所從事的工作，亦表現高度的興趣與熱忱。他們認爲今日煤礦業的困難，在　運　成本太高。例如每噸煤的成本，出礦時約爲二百四十萬元，由津浦路南運至浦口，運費需一百六十萬元，兩者合計已在四百萬元以上。燃管會收煤，規定交貨地點爲浦口，運費由公司負擔。目前生產成本與運費合計，約與官價相等，談不上合法利潤。以窰木而論，由日本易貨得來的窰木，據云品質不佳，不合要救，故均由江南直接採購。每根窰大在產地的售價並高，但因體債大分量重，轉輾運抵礦塲時，每根的成本　在六十萬以上。</p>
<p>煤礦對工作人員的待遇，相當優厚，在陸海東路各地，可能居於首位。他們底薪甚高，計薪時按上海職工生活指數的平均數，折扣計算。據說徐州消費者之中，他們是主力之一。職工的家庭用煤，礦上亦有配給。此外，並設有醫院子弟小學工礦職業學校及員工供應部。由於待遇及福利制度的合理，工作效率很高，且沒有大規模的工潮發生。　在接近前方的綏靖區內，生產是靠</p>
<p>武力掩護</p>
<p>來時行的。尤其是煤礦，共軍視之爲破壞的主要目標，一次殘酷的摧毀，可能一兩年不能復工，所以從去年起，中央亦以保護煤礦視作國軍的一次重要任務。華東煤礦除了本身的三大隊礦警之外，並有駐礦國軍共同擔任　備。第三綏靖區司令部，亦在煤礦公司內。司令部的高級軍官，都很重視保護煤礦的任務，有一位且表示：煤礦之重要性勝過十萬大軍。事實上，由於他們的週密保護，煤礦亦始終未受匪軍的破壞。這兩三年來，由於實際環境的敎育，軍人的政治經濟常識已普遍提高，這是十年前所沒有的。煤礦對於保護者，亦沒有辜負，因爲後者亦分享了他們的福利辦法。我　第十綏靖區內，就聽到那裏的軍官，羨慕駐礦軍官的家庭有住宅水電，子弟可以免費上學呢。（本報記者丁維棟）</p>

<h3 id="c105">川康邊區　夷族觀光團在重慶 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿七日航訊〕川康邊區夷族晋京觀光團廿四日由西昌飛抵重慶，團長孫仿代司令經過三月酬醉，在飛京的前夕，竟然病倒了。這位川康邊區的權威人物，十六歲便入伍當兵，民國十二年，即因戰功，升任川人陳洪範部第八師當營長，與西康省主席劉女輝同事。所以講起資格來，在夷族中實是首屈一指。他活了五十五歲，還祇到過成都，早就有意思要率領一批夷族重要份子赴內地觀光一番，終因夾漢間有隔膜；今日能够隨帶夷務團長羅大英，羅鎭江，果基馬達等離西昌，在夷胞的心目中，確已是　天動人的事件了。</p>
<p>果基馬達在去年還是普雄夷區的「剿漢總司令」，他擁有八千枝新式步槍。去年，有一架從西昌飛來的軍用機在重慶海棠溪上空失事，西昌　部的一位少將處長亦曾遭難。精通漢務的川康邊疆國代尹里底取（漢名李仕安），今晚，在重慶聞人鄭洪福先生宴請觀光團的塲合中，笑語本報記者：「那架飛機就是去普雄投彈的。」現在，普雄的夷漢已是一家了，果基馬達夷務團長還再三表示：他決定聽憑賀國光司令的意思，成立設治局。道一切，都得歸功於數十年努力促進漢夷感情的孫仿靖邊代司令了。</p>
<p>寗屬靖邊司令鄧秀廷三十三年六月逝世，他的家族是今日寗屬最當貴的門第，他與孫仿曾同任寗屬淸鄕總司令羊仁安部的團長。羊下台後，鄧即改組爲靖邊司令，孫任副司令兼團長。按照夷族的習俗，靖邊司令世襲。他的二十餘歲的公子鄧德亮，曾畢業步兵學校，現在南京述職。川康邊區的夷務治安，實際即是孫仿代司令負責。「除暴安良」是孫仿標榜的口號，據說，原先西昌是連城門都不能隨便打開的。　寗屬九縣三局二十六區，劉文輝僅駐一個團，如果沒有孫仿領導下的九個夷務團，（另有一團正規軍，包括漢·夷兵）維持地方秩序，邊務確會不堪設想。</p>
<p>羅大英，羅鎭江二位夷務團長，提起蔣主席，總是充滿了敬崇的情緒·蔣主席在戰時曾到西昌，蔣夫人送給他倆的蔴紗手帕，迄今還未木拭用。他們知道蔣主席一定會當選大總統，因爲：「他比劉文輝還大」，羅鎭江還說：白崇禧也要當副總統。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿六日航訊〕女間諜金璧輝，終於在三月廿五日早晨在北平的河北高等法院第一監獄結束了生命。她曾經幾次請求再審，抗吿，都沒有生效，最後抗吿的駁回裁定，在死的當天早晨三點鐘送給了她。金壁輝前幾天已經感到了死兆，見人談話露出絕望的冷淡。她最初很有自信，不會死，但是知道最高法院核准死刑以後，已經知道自己是不會活的了。</p>
<p>金　的住處是姚家井第一監獄女監第五室漢三號，據說在她三點　接到看守送給她的抗告駁回裁定的時候，似乎已經感到她的生命的結束將是幾個小時以內的事了·所以她曾打牆，吿訴隔壁的漢奸明星李明，讓李明的小女兒，天亮時不要哭，她將要長眠了。果然，五點半鐘看守喚醒了她，說要她在一個文件上按一箕斗，金璧輝此時還不知是執行，頭未梳，臉未洗，披上囚衣睡眼朦朧的跟了看守出去，走過一條輕易不走的小門，看見　名法警立在對面，她方才從　　中有了警覺，呆立了一下，絕望地回頭看了看和她處得很好的女監主任趙愛貞，趙却不安地迥避了。</p>
<p>四個法警，牢牢地抓住了她的手臂，推向東南角的空塲去，此時天色微明，東方是暗淡的魚肚色。檢察官何承斌坐在空塲的公案後，法警把她擁到面前：</p>
<p>「本檢察官是來奉命執行。」　金璧輝臨死還很聰明漂亮，她不再囉嗦，要了紙筆從容的寫了給她義父川島浪速和典獄長等的遺書，手不發顫，面不改色，遺書寫罷，檢察官問金璧輝：</p>
<p>「還有什麼話說嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有了，請你把這遺囑交給找父親！」　「我一定轉給他。」接着命看守拿過兩個饅頭，一瓶酒，但是她拒絕了。檢察官命令法警推去執行。沒有五花大綁，沒有過於强制，金璧輝轉身向西。走出十幾步，她遵從法警的命令跪下去，「撲」的一聲，彈未過火，第二彈打出去，正中金璧輝的後腦，彈從鼻樑穿出去，一股血流到臉上，她的身驅微顫一下向前倒下，這是廿五日的六點四十分。屍體當時被法警移到已經多少犯人用過的薄板長方木匣裏，抬出來，停在西門外的大道旁。左近住的人們聽見槍響都趕來圍住屍身看，一個老太太說「這個門開一次，就有一個死屍抬出來。」事後，記者們被引導去看死屍，聽見的是上面一些話。一個和金璧輝有關係的人說：「最遺憾的是連套衣服也不讓　換！」金璧輝死時穿的是灰囚衣，裏面是紫紅色毛衣，藍毛褲，袖口還露着以前見她時就挽着的白袖頭，白襪靑鞋已沾上土，血跡蓋上了臉的上半部，短短的頭髪結着淤血躺在木板上。　直到中午，日本的一個和尙谷川大行和聯絡班的廣瀨，坐着大卡車來收屍，把金璧輝遺留的衣物包了三大包，三點多鐘載着金的屍身離監東去。</p>
<p>廿六日的早晨，依日本的葬儀在日本人遺下的東郊火葬塲，金璧輝終於火葬了。</p>
<p>金璧輝的一生終於如此結束了。金璧輝果眞如她自己所說：「我是熊熊火焰旁的一滴雪」，！這一滴雪，溶化了。（本報記者宋紹柏）</p>

<p>（三）「餐桌前綫」在重慶</p>
<p>在我們戰時與中國同盟的　部份時期內，中美關係的慢性緊張化，已把重慶餐桌變成個奇突的宣傳戰綫。在這戰綫上，美國人頌揚中國共產黨，而苛責中國中央政府。這種局勢，顯示我們戰時政策的重要要誤和在幕後的思想。</p>
<p>此一錯誤的根源，在於若干美國人不　接受共　本身以前的口號，那就是：「共產的目標以前曾經是中　將　　是世界革命」，在戰時以及戰後，我們需要在兩者之問選　其十：我們是否帮助共產主義，抑或是支持一個效法我們純潔政治與社會理想的政府，直至最近，我們還是沒有決定。　但是除了這種悲慘的猶疑不決之外，我敢確定：我們在戰時官方的鼓勵中國共黨，乃是一種加諸中央政府的壓力，很不需要的，它已近便的代替了美方在互尊及互解基礎上與重慶政府的往來。</p>
<p>這種壓力，也就是被正式承認的　恫嚇，央求，諫吿，及　張聲勢」等戰術。這些戰術，代表了我們與華方往來的標準祿序。這是不需要的，關於此點，已由史迪威綱承者魏德邁將軍予以證明。</p>
<p>美方帮助共黨在重慶增强壓力，不啻玩火。中央政府，雖然在若干美國觀察家看來是這樣的薄弱，但是依然具有充份力量抵抗那種壓力，直至中美關係　魏德邁下　進爲止，對於這點，我們是應該感恩的。</p>
<p>在中國的暗淡和破壞的戰時首都中，社交生活集中在宴會與鷄尾酒會，美國軍官把它們變成延安赤色宣傳以及批評中央政府的講座。</p>
<p>就是在史迪威指揮下的高級官員之間，對於這些事情，也很少謹愼從事。美國觀察家在延安所得到良好印象，無論是怎樣的迅速消逝也很普遍的傳播出去。「中共並非眞正的共黨，他們祗是農民改革者」，這已成為當時的談話原理。</p>
<p>重慶的「餐桌前綫」，已成爲虛偽荒誕句語的集中地，深深的蠱惑了美國民衆，我對此決無懷疑。重慶有勢力的餐桌，一方面成爲反蔣與親共的「戰塲」另一方面，美軍司令部與記者招待所也是這種宣傳的指揮與觀察站。美軍總部與共黨總部都同時與記者招待所維持密切聯絡，或是記者招待所與他們維持聯絡。</p>
<p>中央政府與美軍當局雖然分別以主要及次要地位檢查拍出去的新聞電報，但也很難防阻疎　或偏袒，而絕對不能防阻記者離　後的曲解。在重慶的美國檢查，祗限於保護美國的軍事秘密。</p>
<p>對於中共美麗的描　以及對於政府　固腐敗與無能的黑暗故事，派在重慶的美國記者是最好的聽衆。</p>
<p>中外人在同具史迪成部屬的輕易信心，其中很少政府方面的人物，而大多數是中共與同情中共的人物。</p>
<p>據美軍司令部人員吿訴我的部下說二這種放蕩不覊的談話，曾經史迪威核准，據說這是以壓力加諸委員長的方法。我相信這是事實，但是如果不是，史迪威未能禁止這種行爲，其　誤是同樣的巨大。</p>
<p>在重慶的這種談話，大大的加强了共黨，而减弱了政府的地位。這時候產生了一種觀念，那就是：在國共談判中，主要的要政府方面讓步。</p>
<p>假使果眞看機　促使國共和好而阻止中共捲入國際共產主義的潮流，（我很懷疑會經有這種機會），那種機會，已為美方　的行動所破壞。</p>

<p>〔本報杭州廿九日訊〕「水光瀲灧晴方好，山色空濛雨亦奇；若把西湖比西子，淡妝漢抹總相宜。」這是蘇東坡吟詠西子湖的詩句，今年入春以來，可說是西子淡裝的時間多於濃抹。三月十四日，潘公展先生和女畫家唐冠王先生聯袂到杭州來，本想來杭小休一星期，偏逢春雨綿綿，潘唐二先生遊興不淺，第一日和記者遊了北山，第二日因記者事去贛，他倆冒着雨暢遊湖上，第三日返滬，還留字給我，相約淸明後再米。</p>
<p>唐冠玉畫桃　潘公　題詩</p>
<p>遊罷北山那一晚，我們三人在樓外樓吃飯，這飯店的茶房都認識潘唐　先生的，他們捧出了名人題詠的本子，有意請他倆再留下一點墨寳，唐先生畫興勃發，也許她因為勝利後三年中第一次看見西子湖濱的桃花激動了她的情緒，信手寫來，畫了一幅水墨桃花，在桃花邊又襯了幾筆楊柳，畫來工穩異常，記者愛畫，未有見以墨水淡寫桃花者，蓋桃花艷麗，淡墨往往比用色不易討好，但唐先生所畫正和雨天的西湖一般，雖淡淡勾來，不失春天桃花的淸麗。潘先生就在這畫幅上題了絕：「滿堤桃柳競芳菲，烟雨滿湖入翠微，刦後重來君莫歎，今朝大地又春回。」可說寫盡了情景。</p>
<p>定一天房間　化三天代價</p>
<p>這幾天來，西子湖又是綿綿長雨，但遊客們却並不因雨而阻了遊興，二十八日從上海開到杭州的西湖號車，增到十節客車之多，旅館裏早經客滿，有幾家房間已經定到下月二十日，聽說還有一個旅館要挖費，然後能定到房間，他的理由是爲了你定房間，前一天就不能賣給旁的客人，爲了你定的房間，後一天也不能賣給旁的客人，所以如果你定一天房間，就得費三天的代價。　所有旅館的甬道和有一足之地的地方均被利用，於是一條蓆子租一晚三萬元，一條被子租一晚八萬元，一個枕頭和晚二萬元的臨時賣買，生意十分興隆。近來遊客也異想天開，澡堂，酒樓，飯館都變了臨時宿舍，甚至在咖啡館中打夜撲兄的也很多很多。有錢的人，租用一輛小汽車，白天作爲代步，晚上作爲臨時宿舍，可惜天公不作夫，否則，三輪車，黃包車，划子豈不也是很好的宿舍？</p>
<p>魚　四萬　餚肉僅十塊</p>
<p>酒店飯館生意當然特別好，而樓外樓太和園更好，上兩天定的房間，臨時都被客人佔領，老闆大呼「生意好也不好。」而原定房間的人來了，看看老闆的「哭出汚拉」的面孔，看看這些奪主喧賓的情形，大家都是來遊春的，大家都是沒有辦法，於是只好再和這批奪主喧賓者商量：「你們吃好以後，再讓我們好不好！」至於酒菜店中的菜呢？四百萬的一桌魚翅席，除了個盤中稍稍點綴一些魚翅外，其餘可說一無可吃，連著名的醋溜魚也沒有，冷盤中的一分餚肉，只有十塊，如果有十二個客人，那只好請你原諒了。一專賣客飯的店舖生意也很興隆一不過這種客人不是著名的館子裏一所歡迎的。有一個客人到麵館裏吃麵，呌了一碗過橋麵，算　時要廿萬元，客人大吃一驚，他說：「上海也只要十二萬，那有這樣貴？」跑堂說：「先生，算了吧！這是最便宜的呢？」杭州市政府特每天動員幹部，長駐於各家酒菜館，每家三四人，以免逃去筵席捐。</p>
<p>城站到湖　車價索廿萬</p>
<p>平常杭州的出租汽車店，天天開在城站接客的，空車放回的很多，現在却大不相同了，每天都是浩浩蕩蕩從城站開到湖濱來，這種塲面，記者在剛勝利後在上海得見過。黃包車，轎子，三輪車，當然都是天大要價，從城站到湖濱，本來祗要三萬元的，現在他們也會操上海話對剛下車的客人討價廿萬元之多。</p>
<p>西湖滬艇，更是荒乎其唐，不久規定四十五萬元一天，廿七日又規定六十萬元一天，而劃子討價三百萬元一天，有人還價二百萬元，「少一個小錢都不划你」　杭州眞是「三冬靠一春？」所以要如此的抹了良心的向客人要錢，而也偏有這許多客人情願出錢。這裏原因，記者過去一再指出來了，因爲　家感着苦悶，大家感着前　無把握，不如「今朝有酒今朝　」。但是與古人的遊山玩水，與潘唐二先化的藉此淸心養性都是大異其趣·</p>
<p>瘋狂的心理　應予以糾正</p>
<p>我們住在杭州的人，尤其記者是個神經過　者，對於這種趁火打刧的瘋狂要　與那不顧一切的瘋狂遊客，實　覺　同樣犯着心理上的錯誤。今天，我們現實的環境不好，這當然是不容查定的事實，苦悶是大家有的，但我們總要想法衝破苦悶。杭州山水是好的，但遊山玩水並不是光化錢可以遊得痛快的，遊山玩水，要和二三知己，談談玩玩，免去煩俗，淸靜的環境，而對着知己的朋友，才能由這淸幽中研究出衝破苦悶的方法來。這樣才會感覺湖山的可愛，湖山的美麗。開創西湖有功的白居易，他　離　之後，就無興吟　、他有一詩：「自別錢塘山水後，不多飲酒　吟詩，欲將此意憑廻棹，與報西湖風月知。」現在遊過杭州的人何止千萬，靠杭州遊春，而賴以生活的人也何止千萬，試問：等熟鬧過後，是不是有白居易先生這種心情呢？（本報特派員儲裕生）</p>

<p>— 胡叔異</p>
<p>—為三十七年師範教育運動週作</p>
<p>在難巨的建國工作中，無疑地師範敎育佔有極軍要的地位。但正因爲地位之過於軍要，它的價値，反不易被人明白認識，有時且給作了過低的佔計。當然在目前，不能在工·農·軍·政那一方面，都急切需要培養若干專門人材，來分擔建國重任，以言師範敎育，似乎它的功能微弱而迂緩。然而環顧全國，文肓機佔半數，知識靑年的言行，不是趨於偏激，便是陷於頺廢，在此訓政結束，開始行憲之際，我們正步入民主的大道。民主政治的始基，是地方自治，而國民敎育之普及，又是實行地方自治的根源。否則我們將如何謀全國之精誠團結？又何能在此一片荒墟上來培成建國的人材？於是這重任便自然落在師範敎育的肩上。我以爲今後的師範敎育，應該由自然主義的進而爲理念的，文化的，應該由個人主義的進而為國家的，民族的。</p>
<p>學術研究與專業訓練</p>
<p>師範敎育之成爲一種專門訓練，自然因爲敎育到現在已　爲一種專門學科。無論在理諭的闡發上，課程的編制上，敎法的硏究上，都有了長足的進展。由於學術硏究的進步，師範敎育隨着進步了。同時，因爲師師敎育實施經驗的豐富，學術硏究　進步，也就隨着加速了。二者相互為用，不可分離。所以美國如哈佛，斯丹福等校，爲敎育學科，設有兩種學位：一爲文哲學位，一爲敎育學位。前者爲硏究性質，後者爲專業性質。但我以爲今後我國之師範敎育，不　在謀敎育學科之發揚而已，還須作進一步之要求。</p>
<p>固有文化與民族生命</p>
<p>我們都知道，社會的構成，不祇是自然與人作物質的安排而已。社會的延續，却生重在經驗傳遞。所謂文化，便是社會經驗之延續。而我們師範敎育之效用，　在　　居間傳遞文化之責的師範生，再進　求其發揚，使其光大。我們有五千年的輝煌文化，然而，正如國父所昭示，我們在內憂外患的不斷的　難中，喪失了自信，喪失了活力。今後師範敎育的責任，　在從深處掘發我們民族的生命之源，培植她，使她獲得新生。我們現在貪婪地艷美着外來的文化，但世界上從沒有昧於本國的歷史與固有的文化，而能圖存的。今後的師範生必須對於我國文化的精髓，能了解，能欣當，能把握，以此去薰染，去涵泳全國的國民。所以我說，敎師之專業訓練，不僅在敎法技巧之養成；國民敎育之推行，不僅在知識技能之傳授。敎育若沒有文化，便不會產生。敎育之最高意義，是一種文化作爲。師範敎育應注重本國文化之發揚，師範生應對本國文化作畏期陶冶。這樣，我國今後的敎育才能由自然的，功利的，進而爲文化的，精神的。</p>
<p>解脫淺薄的功利主義</p>
<p>再進一步說，一國的文化，便是一國的立國精神。一國的國魂。師範敎育是國民敎育之始基，而一國的立國精神，便寄托在國民敎育之上。從中外各國的歷史看來，由危亡中復興起來的國家，幾乎無不從勵行國民敎育，嚴格訓練師資得來，我以爲今後的師範敎育，應該從狹隘的個人主義，淺薄的功利主義中解脫出來。敎育本是人與人彼此形成而結合的交互作用。一切特殊的個別的，只有從屬於一般的，全體的才有意義。一個民族，一個國家，有其共通的歷史，共通的理想。我們要使每個國民，生活在這同一的信仰與理想之下，造成一個偉大的「同心」（Like－mindedness），造成一個完整的，有機的，休戚與共的國家。因爲個體只有縣屬於國家，隸屬於民族，才能生存。這樣幷非抹殺了個體的價値，我們深信，只有超超個已，才能發展個已。我想，經過八年艱苦的抗戰，現在還在受內亂的磨折的我們，當更能體味這主張，國家至上，民族至上的師範教育的意義。全國的國民，應在同一的三民主義信仰下生活着，進展着；肩負這重任的，便是今後的師範敎育。它要根據我國的歷史與固有文化，造成同一信仰，同一理想，這樣推廣下去，使全國國民，在如此的氣氛下生活着。所以我說今後我國的師範敎育，應由個人主義進而爲民族的國家的。</p>
<p>虔　推行師道的理想</p>
<p>而且，考之我國歷史，敎師的地位，本來特別崇高。敎師的責任，便在傳道，豈僅是文字的傳授而已？所謂道，從現在觀點說來，便是一國所固有的信仰與理想。所謂師嚴而道尊，便是說，敎師能虔敬的推行這理想，才能使它發揚光大。</p>
<p>我想，今後師範敎育，能遵循這一途徑推行下去，憲政的始基，才能牢固的奠定，我們中國的百年大計，才不會動搖。</p>

<p>公開羽球決賽第一日，魏金生夫人洪德全組以二比一勝潘綠芙小姐李國璠組，獲混合雙打錦標，華家杰則以二比〇勝史巴士，榮膺初級單打冠軍。</p>
<p>史巴士昨全失常態，局勢被華家杰控制，華操縱自如，得心應手，先以十五比七勝，下局史一度有起色，但失誤頻見，卒又以九比十五再敗，華之得勝相當容易。</p>
<p>混合雙打登塲，因潘綠芙網前之失誤，洪魏組瞬息間即以七比〇佔優。李國璠力戰，取得四分，但往後一籌莫展，洪魏即以十五比四勝首局。</p>
<p>次局開始，仍少緊張鏡頭，洪魏迎得十分，局勢成面倒，往後李潘小心應付，雙方戰戰兢兢，比數逐漸接近，競爭亦漸趨緊張而激烈，李潘果追成十一平手，且反以十五比十三後來居上，扳回一局。</p>

<p>一雙十二碼球判分勝負</p>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕銀牌的錦標，廿一日在快活谷裘決奪，甲組是星島東方爭湖，乙組南華海軍鬥法，我們以絕對愉快的心情去看這兩塲球賽·第一戰，南華不負衆望，擊退去年的盟主，這確使人快感。第二塲，東方不畏强敵，着着迫脅星島，使觀衆看到緊張的球賽。眞是一件巧合約事情，這兩塲緊張的球賽，都是一對〇決勝負。</p>
<p>東方敗在球證</p>
<p>平心論事，東方踢得特別出色，所以敗，敗在球證，楊格所判的第一隻十二碼球，連星島自己也莫明其妙，這隻球，是曾錫康和朱永强跳起爭奪，當時大慨是錫康碰了一下「小朱」，就被判極刑。說句客觀的話，一塲這樣重要的比賽，開賽僅兩分鐘，而犯規的情形又是那機微妙，似不應該判罰。</p>
<p>東方是成功的，握有全塲百分六十的攻勢，要是惠林和熾芬有較好的表演，德麒能有好的接濟的話，情形就全不同了。我早就指出，東方的取球，僅靠福銓的遠扣，和德祺的急射，但星島並不是一枝等閒的勁旅，這一下，是很難找到機會的。</p>
<p>但東方的一條中衛綫，有使人想不到的好處，幾乎控有整個中塲的優勢，曾錫康頭脚均佳，自開始至終局，全沒有走樣，難能可貴。均幹也有穩健的表演，撲出兆榮第二隻十二碼球，姿勢美妙。全軍有道樣的演出，以一個十二碼球送掉錦標，太不値了。</p>
<p>星島完全失常</p>
<p>眞的，星島賽來完全失常，一條鋒綫左調右調，也無法有好的成就，朱永强先踢正前鋒，給漢臣看得無法動彈。下半塲，踢錦河的位置，應芬調充正前鋒，錦河任右翼，也還沒有好的攻勢。</p>
<p>以活力充盈於時的一條中街綫，靈聖站在後頭全力看牢「渣女」，兩前衛又要注意於守，於是變了助攻能力不足，星島　得帶點運氣了，從演出的角度去看，它實在無法佔到優勢了。</p>
<p>上塲十二碼球</p>
<p>開賽：星島拿出一貫的戰術來，開球便攻，應芬自右邊深入，適當處，大脚吊中，永强正想躍頂，不防錫康搶救，這一下混亂，便被判十二碼球。兆榮主罰得手，一對〇，這時，剛好是開塲後兩分鐘。經此，東方便拼命　進，先見熾芬射門被接，榮光兩度迫門失機。十九分鐘時，惠林撥交福銓，這是一個好的機會，福銓在廿碼處提起一脚，又吿斜出。跟着，錫康開罰球，德祺頂高，變了攻勢雖多，毫無成就。</p>
<p>卅分鐘過了，惠林被竟成弄傷，再上陣時，東方後防吿急，永强匹馬搶進，錫康「飛　」，又是一個十二碼球。這回兆榮射，均幹却救出，前半時，便成了一比〇的局面。</p>
<p>下半時無紀錄</p>
<p>再戰：東方還是進攻未歇，德祺運球前進，斜交惠林，「地保」臨門失脚，惠林得球吊向門角，梁榮光經驗不足，竟然衝不到。一次，輪到榮光得機，耀德撲空。假使榮光肯將球挑交中路，機會必有，但他竟大脚射高。這裏，虎隊只有一個好的射門機會，便是永强得機迎門急送，馮景祥奔前一碰，德譜截出。於此混來混去，兩隊都無法再加一球，東方只好飲恨快活谷，一球被屈於星島。</p>

<p>據上海貨物稅局消息：財政部頃以石油一項，係屬礦產品類，前經開徵礦產稅，嗣於三十一年間因進口油已由政府核定免徵關稅，國產石油亦暫援外油成例，停止徵收。現進口外油除原油外，汽油柴油兩項業已恢復徵收進口稅，並將該項汽油柴油及煤油進口稅，一律增加爲百分之五十。茲對國產石油礦產稅，亦即日開始恢復徵收，其徵收辦法如下</p>
<p>（一）徵稅範圍，以原油及原油提煉而成之汽油·煤油·柴油·機械油·石蠟·瀝靑·等爲對象，如已徵稅，原油提煉汽油等項，於徵稅時，准將原油稅款扣除，國外已徵進口稅者，憑證免徵。</p>
<p>（二）應徵稅率規定從價徵收百分之三，至其徵稅價及稅額，應由各區貨物稅局查明市塲最近一個月之平均批價計算。</p>
<p>（三）計稅單位，以每「加侖」計算。</p>
<p>（四）已徵稅石油，除塡發完稅照外，並於油桶油箱上，監貼印花，加蓋驗戮。</p>
<p>（五）在未恢復開徵前，所有已出廠行銷市面存貨，免補稅款，但運出外埠，仍應申請照章徵稅，至存廠貨品，於出廠時應一律課徵。</p>
<p>貨物稅局奉令後，特公吿本市經營國產石油廠商，限於五日內，將經營油類名稱，採用石油成品比率，每種油類平均批價，列表報局，以憑登記課徵云。</p>

<p>〔本報鄱陽二十五日訊〕贛省地居溫帶，土壤肥沃，尤其東南接壤粵·閩各縣，已入亞熱帶範圍，最適於甘蔗的種植。產量之豐，首推饒河區之樂平·鄱陽·萬年·德興·浮梁，贛河區之贛縣·南康·大庾，撫河區之臨川·崇仁。</p>
<p>上述各產地中，以樂平產額最巨。故本省產蔗稱盛之地，製糖事業，亦隨之而興。糖產之富，居全國第三位，僅次於川·粵兩省。盛時年產額約三十萬祖，出產種類，除贛南有紅白兩種外，餘均爲赤砂糖。祇因製法不良，各糖廠坊，每多於收蔗時，臨時設廠製造，不能分離糖蜜，質地粗糙，致銷路限於省內，半　又爲當地所消費，糖業迄難進展。</p>
<p>戰前省當局，雖曾一度設價精糖廠計劃，旋因故未即進行。民二十六年三月間，財部顧問瑞西德，到贛調查造酒植物精原料，曾徽詢對設立新式大規模糖廠意見；並與工商管理處詳加硏討。關於糖廠地址，以南康·樂平兩地，擇一設置，因樂平爲京贛鐵路所經之要站，接近浙贛路；南康有贛河及公路可通，兩地交通，均有相當優點。瑞氏接洽後，對該處所貢要點，頗爲贊許，允將徵答意見，轉達財部採擇。建廳亦為開發農產富源，是年秋間，龔廳長學遂由省赴杭轉滬，向滬金融界接洽招股合辦，資本定一百萬元，官商各半。旋因抗戰開始，南樂兩廠，均未進行。</p>
<p>最近興業公司爲恢復本省製糖事業，決定在贛縣設立糖廠，所需流動資金爲十五億元，已向銀行洽商貸款。該廠預定出品爲上·中·白糖·黃糖·頭漏·拮漏等五種，預計年產量爲四，五〇〇市祖，將在本　甘蔗出新時，進行收購，開製遝銷。</p>

<p>— 秦浩</p>
<p>本市輾銅廠現共有十五六家，各廠之總生產量在最高峯時（民國三十五年）每季約可產銅皮一千八百七十八噸，銅絲六百六十六噸，銅管十八噸。</p>
<p>品質方面，各廠所軋製之紫銅皮因技術欠佳，硬度不足，尙未能普遍適應工業上之需要；故現在各廠出品，均偏重於黃銅皮之軋製。所製黃銅皮成份，其中銅約佔十六七，鋅約佔十之三四。最近一般廠商，因鑒於原料昂貴，不勝負祖，多攙雜廢銅，以謀减輕成本，故品質漸見退化。</p>
<p>各廠所用原料，凡國內所產者，年來均因交通阻滯，到貨稀少，乃不得不悉賴外貨原料之接濟。外貨原料中，以墨西哥之三T銅塊最受歡迎，惟自政府對進口物料實施限制以來，外貨來源亦發生問題，故目前亦須向市上搜購舊銅，以資維持。</p>
<p>去年，上海市輾銅工業同業公會向輸出入管理委員會第二期（五六七三個月）申請進　之原料量爲紫銅一四，七四七市擔，黃銅一八，八六三市擔，鋅五，七二〇市擔，然實際配得之數量極爲微小，故原料來源至感困難。</p>
<p>乙，金屬品冶製工廠上海市金屬冶製工業同業公會現有會員共二百三十餘家，公會設於中正東路，主持人為　松齡君。該會所屬會員工廠其規模大者均以冶鑄生鐵爲主要業務，冶製銅品，僅係一種副業而已。其中尤以上海鋼鐵公司規模最宏，堪執華中冶煉鋼鐵工業之牛耳。此類工廠實際上已具重工業之雛型。各廠出品有管子配件，機械，泗汀，凡而，車輛零件，紡織機件，老虎鉗以及香烟機，織布機等。</p>
<p>規模小者則多爲銅品翻砂廠，各廠職工，多者亦祗十數人，少者僅二三人。其出品爲洗衣之烘乾盤，紡織廠燙毛織品毛頭之紫銅軸，引擎地軸上之婆司及機器零件等。</p>
<p>關於生產量方面，最大者每月約可鍜鑄生鐵六十至七十噸。銅鉛翻砂廠規模較大者每月生產量平均爲銅或鉛一百五十擔至二百擔。出品較著者當推華豐。該廠專以馬口鐵（即白鐵）製造各種機器，因馬鐵性質堅韌，所製機件，遠較生鐵製品堅固耐用，故該廠所製機件，台灣糖業公司中國紡織建設公司各水電工程營造蔽上海電力公司等均樂於採用。</p>
<p>至於各廠所用原料，除一部份係向鞍山鋼鐵公司購買外，主要來源，仍爲市上搜得之舊貨。</p>
<p>丙　五金工業廠（即零件製造廠）上海市五金工業同業公會現有會員共二百四十餘家，公會設於本市海寗路，主持人爲處腎德君。各會員工廠規模最大者擁有職工二三百人，小者僅三五人而已。設備方面，除車床·鑽床·創床等普通機件外，並視其需要，備有各種不同之特殊機件，以製造各式五金零件。所用原料，以黃銅爲最多。製造品有水道用具，各式門鎖·拉練·打火機·電器用品·錶帶·鐘錶零件等。經營上述工業之工廠，共計有一百二十餘家，實佔五金工業同業公會全體會員半數以上。紫銅工業較次，共有工廠三十餘家，其產品有衛生設備之附屬令件·電氣用品·茶吊·飯鍋等。此外，尙有一部份工廠專製鋼鐵零件。</p>
<p>各廠所用原料，其來源有二：一爲仰賴資源委員會·進口商·銅錫拆料號及五金商等供應。另一爲向輸管會原料配給處申請進口原料配給，據估計每季需用原料約在六百萬磅以上。</p>
<p>（四）販賣商</p>
<p>關於上海區內銅製品生產情形，已詳上述，茲再就銷售狀况，作一介紹。查銅製品種類繁多，用途不一，故販賣商性質亦各不同，分別隸屬於銅錫商業同業公會，五金商業同業公會，五金零件商業同業公會，五金舊貨商業同業公會。此四種販賣商中，當以五金商號資力最稱雄厚，營業範圍亦廣，實居五金販賣業之領袖地位。茲再逐一分述如後：</p>
<p>（一）五金商號　上海市五金商業同業公會現有會員共四百四十九家，主持人爲趙顯吉君。公會設於虹口九龍路。各會員商號營業範圍殊爲廣泛，且因各商號平時與進口業均有密切連擊，故各類五金舶來品，均操於彼等之手。其經營之商品：金屬品方面包括鑛砂，重要汽車零件等；鋼鐵方面有光地軸，馬口鐵，竹節鋼，鐵板，鋼軌各種銅品及鐵管等；機件方面有各種紡織機器，鋼珠軸領，船舶建築材料以及各式鑽頭螺絲等。</p>
<p>（二）銅錫五金號　上海市銅錫商業同業公會現有會員共二百二十二家，公會設於南市方浜中路，主持人爲蕭爾駿君。銅錫五金號主要業務爲販賣銅，錫，鉛，鋁及鋅五種金屬品，然就其營業範圍而言，尙可分爲二類，即拆料號與器皿號是。前者大都專營金屬原料及半製成品，後者則專營各種輕便家用器皿，俗稱銅匠店，即指此類商號而言。</p>
<p>拆料號幾均集中於北京東路一帶，所銷售者有紅黃白各種銅皮，銅絲，銅塊，粗細銅管，各色銅棒，各種硬鉛，靑鉛皮，鉛絲，焊錫，白鐵皮，鋅塊，以及銻鎳等。營業收入相當可觀，依法在物價標準計算，每月售貨平均可達三四百億元。</p>
<p>拆料號之貨物來源，一部份係向東北，華北，雲南等地採購，惟最近因上述數地交通困難，故到貨甚少，乃多託進口商直接向國外定貨，以應需要。舶來品中銅皮以英貨及香港貨爲多，在市上均甚暢銷。尺寸最大者爲四呎乘八呎，及十四吋乘四十八吋等。美貨有三十吋乘六十吋，三呎乘六呎等。黃銅元最粗者直徑達三吋半，紗銅元有大至四吋半者，銅管最粗約四吋。此外尙有憐銅皮，燐銅板，燐銅絲，亦來自歐美或香港，其售價極昂，較國產等銅品約高四倍至十倍。</p>
<p>器皿號專營各種家用物品，如銅門環，茶壺，銅鎖，痰盂，銅吊，蠟托，面盆，酒壺等，此類商店，實爲我國舊式手工業之一，其主要銷路對象爲舊式家庭，鄉農，及寺院等。其營業以冬季最爲旺盛，惟近年因時局不定，人民購買力日减，故營業已遠不如前。器皿號規模較大者有樂源昌等七八家，所用原料向拆料號批購外，亦自向市上搜購舊貨，以資補充。</p>
<p>（三）五金需件　本市五金零件材料號現共有四百八十二家，同業公會設於天津路，主持人爲兪又鑣君。五金零件號主要營業爲建築房屋之各種附屬品，如衛生設備，門鎖，螺絲，三星鋸條，三角錊，人頭砂布等。該業過去在整個五金業中佔極重要地位，惟近年因建築事業毫無生氣，故五金零件號營業情形亦受重大影饗，大有一落千丈之勢。其經營之商品除一小部份爲國貨外，十九均係來自香港。</p>
<p>（四）五金舊貨號　本市五金舊貨號現有三百二十餘家，設同業公會於芝罘路，主特人爲葛樹明君。該業去年因受市面不景氣影響，難以維持，紛紛停業，先後達百餘家之多，今年雖已次第復業，然因外貨進口困難，且向海外訂貨結匯又屬不易，國內則舊貨存底量日减，故仍在組難中掙扎。</p>
<p>五金舊貨號之主要營業爲版賣各種五金舊貨，間亦有代客戶向歐美訂貨者。貨品銷路以外埠較廣，所售之貨則以建築材料，自來水管，鋼條，農具等爲大宗。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>查銅製品工業乃現代重要輕工業之一，其盛衰不但與整個民族工業之前途息息攸關，且影響國防建設尤鉅。銅製品工業在上海雖有相當悠久之歷史，惟嚴格論之，殊無遠大基礎，所以然者，不外設備不足，技術落後，原料匱乏曁財力支絀之故。雖至今日，無論在質的方面或量的方面，均不逮美英蘇諸國遠甚。近半年來，因外匯率上漲太速，且分配額逐漸縮减，以致原料尤感不敷，而工人生活指數則逐月上升，致一般廠商多捨本逐末，競相　積存料，以圖一時之利，良堪扼腕。</p>
<p>總之，上海銅製品工業不論在生產或銷路方面，均充滿不景氣現象，兩國營廠（中央造幣廠與中央電工器材廠）設備猶嫌不足，其他民營小廠自更無論矣。故今後欲謀該業之發展，尙有待政府當局之協助及該業本身之努力，先在設備及技術上力謀充實改善，首求品質之進步，然後再謀生產之增加。同時產銷雙方尤應密切合作，以收指臂之效，業中高明人士，諒不河漢斯言也！（完）</p>

<h3 id="c161">杜威論藝術與自由 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣炳賢</p>
<p>在藝術史裏，藝術家的創作自由始終是個爭論不決的縣案。藝術似求自始就是「自由」與「極權』，『民主』與『專制』問的戰塲。爭論的焦點在藝術家　　說些『什麼』和『怎樣』說法。在集權的國家裏，這兩種問題的決定都操於當局的手裏，他們唯一日的想使藝術　爲『御用』工具，便不惜用種種方法給藝術創作加上許冬限制，例如設立檢本制度，禁止出版，加以收賣等等。他們使這些措施合施合起見，往往舉出『一種至高　善良』，一種道德律，一種宗敎的眞理，一種極權論，使人們相信人類的幸福和解救必需以遵守國家　　　前提。柏拉圖在『法律』篇裏把詩人視爲成脅國家安寗的危險份子，他說『立法者和詩人是敵對的，如果後者的言論和國家法律不背馳，他是可以被寬容的』。柏拉岡的看法不過是哲理的根據，可是到了羅馬敎上手裏便成爲宗敎信條。中世紀耶穌敎徒倡苦行主義求來世解脫，藝術是現世中一種享樂，所以被看成一種非孽。因此藝　在敎士的壓迫下不啻成爲他們的奴役。十六世紀宗敎改革運動之後，帝王和貴族代替了敎十，此後政客和商人莫不　做藝術的「恩主」爲榮。第一次大最後三種集權主義勃起：布爾希維克主義，法西斯主義，羅馬敎權主義，雖都是同類的矛盾的集團，却無不以駕　藝　爲己任。他們採用同樣　　輯來證明他　　舉動　當，他　採用同樣的方法來　害藝太。事實上，他們的舉動適足以說明藝　對　人類心靈和思想有極大的左右力量。藝術是人心交感共鳴的工具。若是藝術只是藝術家個人的「自言曰語」，誰都不會留意它。集權主義者所以要控制藝太，因爲恐怕藝　一旦失了控制，便如脫　之馬，奔騰在踊，漫無止境。藝術家的想象產生了許多奇異的思想和觀念，喊出了許多嶄新的美麗的名詞，結果藝　家的　想世界往往和集權主義的現實世界格格不　相容，無疑的執政者要竭力擯斥這種解放　的搗亂性的東西了。</p>
<p>可是藝　在另一環境里所處的地位就不同了。在自由社會中沒有人會摧殘藝太的。因爲藝術活動所產生的種種新奇思想可以增强自由社會的健全和生展。杜成認爲藝太的熱力和美，由於普通經驗的增進，延展和凈化底結果，成爲「共同意義」（Sharedmeaing）的幽契，使許多不同的心靈　結在一起。每一種新思潮，等於一分增强此種團契的力量。藝術底自由，就是自由社會底完美。英國詩人雪萊認爲討人是自由社會眞正的創造人，給我們制定了人生理想，此種說法和杜威的論調不　而合。</p>
<p>社　在「藝術經驗論」（Art　a，experienc）一書里，對　藝術在普通人生中的地位有極詳　精湛的討論。這部書是根據一九三二年他在哈佛演稿輯成的，實際上是杜氏經驗　　底重述，不過　次却以藝術爲中心問題。社威認爲人是　種有機體，社會的一份了。他不　　　　在這個世界上，沒有　們人是生來個人主義省，他只是　體中的　部份，在相許多其他人性和價値發生不斷變化的關係中，他認識了自己的　實。他永遠的迫切的要求在謀這種開係的豐富，此和　富即是自由，自由底滿足成爲智　。人類除了衣食溫暖外，尙須有　富的精神生活，杜威主張採用「探究」和「從新評價」的方法，去獲取「共同　義」底自由交流。智慧不是　　私有的能力，却是一種公共的力量，一種歷代累積成就的匯流和普及。個人底貢　　是涓涓細流而已。因此杜威極端憎　所謂絕對的個人主義，他不贊成近代科學分野太嚴。宇宙中各種事理都彼此息息相關，求知治學的方法雖在表面上各成系統，在事實上却不　割開，都是一種「歷程」中的重要一環。</p>
<p>這種「歷程」就是人生經。正常底賡　。在人追求自由和生存發展中，經驗　　複雜，變化無常，慢慢的由矛盾由求得上調，從紛亂中獲得方寸，於是我們領略到剎那間的熱烈的生命；這時我們明瞭生命源力底關係是「規律」，生命變化的連擊是「形式」。我們稱這種經騐爲「美感經騐」，任何一種經騐都可以變成「美感經騐」，即使是最實局的東西也可成爲藝術品。藝術的創造是把生糙相淺的東西加以剪裁錘鍊，從新給以價値與形式，結果便成爲「新的經騐底孕蓄豐滿　物質」，它並不是一種離開了現實理騐而趨於玄妙世界的逃避。這種新的經騐，隨着時日而無間斷的半展變化。因此，藥品不　　　或哲學的作品，旣不預料世界，也不闡明世界，它只表現世界。几造形藝術或非造形藝術的價値和　義，無不靠「可見可聞的性質」表達出來，此種「性質」就是藝術品所用的材料：如雕刻　　泥，大理石，或銅，　家的顏料，音樂家　聲音。一件藝術品所用的材料，形式與內容是台一的，分不開的。歌德說「自然沒有核也沒有數。」社威對藝術也作這樣的看法。藝術經騐是「眞實」與「理想」，「表面」與「深度」，「知覺」和「意念」底合一。藝術品　給我們新奇和善美，它不米敎訓我們，它也決不負任何使命。藝術是一種公共的語言，由語言和文化相異的人民共同參與和共同欣賞。因此文化的至要工作是給人類供備豐富的美感經驗。專實上文化的任務在傳播人生藝術，藝術品是帮助個人去共事生活藝術最親切而有力的工具。杜威說當今的世界面臨着一　把從前的文化遺產和現代知織匯合起來的艱巨工作，很明顯的藝術最宜於担負起這樁工作。因爲每一種藝術在把「一羣本身毫無美感的表物和意義」，放進「一種趨向完善的有規律和有節奏的行動中」而成爲一種美感經驗時，這種藝術等於例示了此種永在追求中的匯合。</p>
<p>總之，民主社會的生活方式底要素，在於那種基於不斷的自由交流的共同生活和共同經驗，這等於說藝術要在人與人之中造成情感思想的交流匯通，使人羣成爲一體。藝術逐漸發揚光大，人生世相也就顯得豐富華嚴。藝術底登峯造極，即是自由底至善至美。</p>
<h3 id="c162">亞里士多德　為學的方法 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 不黨</p>
<p>亞里士多德做學問的方法。一方面是邏輯，一方面是實地觀察。邏輯是他承繼柏拉圖的產業，而加以廓充的，實地觀察是他自己的家當。柏拉圖的辯證法其實就是具體而微的歸納與演繹，我們只要翻開他的書，就見得：他每討論一個問題，必先由日常生活中舉出實例，再參考普通常識上所公認的見解，然後案語言或文字上的習慣與規則來下結論，或成立某一類行爲或事物的概念。亞里士多德並不反對這種辦法，實際上自己也用，只是對它不大滿意，以爲這還不够準確，不够完備，因此，他便從事增修，增修的結果成了一個專門的方法論。</p>
<p>至於他所增修的成績，可分兩方面來說：（一）關於演繹法的。——柏氏的演繹所根據的只是語言文字上的普通習慣與規則，亞氏以爲這靠不住，因爲語言文字裏面有許多沿用的錯誤，以及其他簡略疏漏的地方，不能完全代表思想的程序；於是他潛心研究的結果發明了所謂三支　法（Syllogism），和其他邏憐上的種種方式與規則。這就成了眞正的演繹邏輯（Deductiv　logic）。（二）關於歸　法的。—柏氏的歸納所用的材料只是日常生活上的例子和普通常識上的見解，亞氏以爲不够，同時也靠不住，因爲日常生活上所接觸的事實畢竟有限，而普通常識上的見解往往錯誤，不如直到最固定，最確實的自然界裏去找材料。他這種主張便把已往的歸納法改個方向，替將來的歸納法開條新路。有他這樣的主張，才能有後來培根（Francis　Bacon，1564-1626）所提倡的歸納法，和現代的科學方法。</p>
<p>亞氏雖然吿訴我們自然界的材料更可靠，雖然指出實地觀察的路子，他在這方面的成功，用現代的眼光看，畢竟還是有　。不過這不能怪他，他總算已經盡其能事，無可余何的是時代的限制。他的時代有兩個阻力使他的成績比不上後來的科學：（一）積極方面的思潮，（二）消極方面的缺之。所謂思潮就是柏氏的冥想與辯證的風氣。當時實地觀察的風氣不曾開，亞氏還算一個首倡者，首倡者的成功往往不及繼成者，道也是理勢所必然的。所謂缺乏是指儀器的缺乏。他當時研究的時候，沒有鐘錶却要計時間，沒有寒暑表却要量熱度，沒有風雨表却要驗氣候，沒有望遠鏡却要看天文，盡其所有只是一把尺，一個規，和一兩件極簡陋的工具。</p>
<h3 id="c163">謠言心理（一） <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 力正</p>
<p>謠言是一種口頭的傳說，它的內容雖不免無稽，但却是最原始的新聞。尤其是當一個國家在非常時期，一切新聞都受控制，人民最　心時事而又不能得着充分的消息時，謠言便乘　逢起。在這種時候，我們發現有兩種新聞在鬥爭着：一種是官方的正式報導，一種是非正式的民間傳說。官方的報導是有組織的宣傳，民間的傳說是漫無組維的流言。但結果却總是謠言佔着上風。組織在如此情形下爲甚麼竟不產生力量？我們何要從謠言的心理起源，謠言的傳播、及社會心理三方面來討論，本文先從第一點說起。</p>
<p>一八五七年，印度的大暴動，可算是一個有名的謠言例證。那個時候，士兵所用　毛瑟鎗，尙沒有如今日一般便利　子彈。火藥是裝在筒衷，要放　時，先要吸破那火藥筒上塗了脂肪的油紙，才能將火藥傾入鎗口，方能發火。謠言便產生在這小小的油紙上。軍隊衷的回敎徒聽說這油紙上塗的是豬油，他們認爲這是最大的侮辱，因爲猪是回敎徒所視爲最示潔　動物。軍隊中的印度敎　則聽說這些脂肪是牛脂，如此，他們便凟犯了聖牛會遭大殃。這樣，不論回敎徒也好，印度敎徒也好，大家都觸怒了，一齊暴動起來。英國政府發現這謠言後，立即盡力洗刷，無論如何解釋，如何用乳酪來代替汕脂，但結果仍不能抑止謠言　力量。爲甚？謠言麽的起源有極深沉的心理原因。印度人憎恨英國政府，仇恨的情續從謠言中找到了出路。</p>
<p>除非我們了解抑制作用Repression對於個人心理的影響，我們不能了解謠言爲甚麼如此動人。許多平日不能出之於口的現在可以隨便說了，這對於鬱抑的情緒是一個極暢快的解放。因此一般人民平素決不肯說謊的，可是遇見謠言，雖明知它缺乏事實的根據，他仍不惜侃侃而談。原因是『道聽塗說，」誰都沒有『責任感』，所謂『姑妄言之，姑妄聽之』。無責任感是謠言盛熾的一大原因。</p>
<p>精神分析學派說夢是由於逃避責任感的心理現象。因此謠言很有些類似夢境，理智的成分少，情感的成分多。謠言和夢一般是滿足平素不能滿足的慾望的。例的　個下屬對於的長官，侍候着惟恭惟敬，一點也不敢批評。假如有一種謠言對他的長官不利的，他對於這一種消息便如獲至賽，逢人宣楊了。例如他明知他那一位長官身體極健康，倘若有謠言傳說他會退休養疴，他仍會添油加醋煊染其事傳給人家聽的，因爲這滿足他一種欲望——討厭長官的心理。他平日對於長官的恭敬，底下却潛伏着一種反抗的情　。謠言便給他一個機會滿足他這種平日無法發洩的悶氣。精神分析派所講的欲望的滿足Wisn　fulfillment即作如此講。</p>
<p>謠言和夢一般，大多是不道德的，至少是破壞性的多，建設性的少。這也由於『如是我聞』的不負責任，正如『無名揭帖』的駡人傳單一般。建設性的批評，或善意的好言，說來不用忌諱，故不必轉灣抹角道來。祗有破壞性的批評，平素不敢隨便說，因此遇着機會，便兜搭上去，所以謠言多是些壞話，所謂『好事不出門，惡事傳千里』的。除此以外，又因人皆好勝，總想自己佔上風。要保持自己優越感、最便當的辦法就是貶落他人的地位。『道人之短』便是謠言的通常特徵。</p>
<p>此外，我們尙可以找出一稱理由來解釋毀謗一類的謠言。我們誣人犯法，正因爲自已想犯法而沒有機會，便借謠言來發洩我們這一股衝動。例如寓言中的狐狸般，他羨慕着圓熟的葡萄，又因爲生得太高吃不着，便駡葡萄酸來解嘲。許多人自己想貪汚而沒有貪汚的機會，因而　最熱心於揭發貪汚。許多老處女最喜歡談某太太某小姐的不規矩，許多女學生喜歡謠傳某人某人有情人，其心理的背景全相似。俗語說：『來說是非的，便是是非人』，自己不熟衷，一切話早當作耳邊風，誰復高興來提及？自己最熱衷的事情，才容易聽進去，也最熱心傳出來。個人口中的謠言，便投射出來他個人內心的底蘊。</p>
<h3 id="c164">關於懷黑德敎授 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>最近逝世的英國偉大哲人懷黑德敎授（Prof，A．N．Whithead），作者曾將其生平，著作，思想，爲人，簡路的介紹過（見本刋第十四期）。關於懷氏，作者要說的話甚多。他是當代思想界的巨人。他的思想豐富而深奧，勢必永遠成爲以後學者硏究的對象，也必成爲解釋紛紜的對象。作者不十分明瞭他。可是當代哲人中能澈底明瞭他的思想的，恐怕也不會多。</p>
<p>英哲羅素（B．Russell）自然也算當代一個偉大哲人。他曾和懷氏合著「數學原理」一書，也曾受業於懷氏。他應該是最能理解懷氏思想的人。可是當懷氏「歷程與實在」（Process　andReality）一書出版後，羅素適到美國哈佛大學講演。懷氏爲主席，介紹羅氏之後，羅氏便說：「我對於懷黑德敎授的新著是不甚明瞭的。」作者是時也在讀懷氏這一部新著，正苦難於理解，聽了羅氏這話，內心不覺安慰了不少。但羅氏之不能理解懷氏，也許是因爲他們兩人思想路綫不同的緣故。懷氏介紹羅氏時曾說過如下的話：「我們兩人合寫「數學原理」一書時，關於符號的本身是彼此同意的，然關於符號的意義，便彼此意見不同」。所以「數理邏輯」一書的文字部份多出自羅氏的手筆，符號部份才是兩人的合作。</p>
<p>懷氏「歷程與實在」一書，確是難懂。不懂這書的，不僅是羅氏，即另一有名的哲人，史塔賓女士（Stebbing），對於這書，也表示難於理解。她在一九三〇年十凡的「心靈季刊」上，發表一篇書評。她的結論是，不是這書的思想過於深奧，非我們這一代的人所能判斷，就是這書乃思想根本不淸楚的產品，而以深入的洞見之光照耀於其間。懷氏看見了這種評語，頗爲生氣。一大他在「玄學硏究班」上對學生們大談思想和語言　關係。他認爲語言不能完全表達思想，更難表達哲學的思想。我們想僅以傳統哲學的有限名辭，表達現有的哲學思想，這是必定失敗的·他所以創造哲學上許多新辭新句的理由，就是意在補救這種缺陷。故讀哲學書的人，不能專恃語言，必須努力深思，去尋求語言以外的意味。他乃鄭重的對學生說：「哲學不是安樂椅上的科學」。換一句話，哲學不是思想懶惰者的科學。讀哲學，不能期望一讀即懂，一讀不懂，便以爲這種哲學的思想有問題，這是思想懶惰的表示。這句話對於作者的印象極深，希望我國學人也注意這一語。</p>
<p>懷氏在哈佛大學，每學期均授兩門課程，一門是演講的，一門是討論的。演講的課程，第一學期是：「新舊宇宙論」，第二學期是：「哲學與科學」。討論的課程，第一學期是玄學，第二學期是邏輯。今人有謂老年人不當任敎，觀於懷氏，即知道這話是靠不住的。</p>
<h3 id="c165">學林樷話（十五） <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>現代歐美思潮　（下）</p>
<p>（六）直覺主義法人柏格森（Henri　Bergoon一八五九至一九，以本能爲好孩子，智　爲壞孩子。本能之精到處稱為直覺。他以為直覺由內省得之，智　由外觸得之。直覺聯於時間，智慧聯於空間。直覺爲綜合的而非分析的，能將過去與米來相交會，故具有遠見。柏格森以爲生命之流奔騰向前，生命之衝動與奮門均有賴於直覺，他主張要爲行動而行動，思想不過是行動的工具。智慧如夢，司純粹思維而不活躍，邏輯與數學都不能爲積極的精神活動。柏格森學說重行輕知，反抗理性，羅素以爲其說獨斷，缺乏證據。柏格森寫際也是盧騷以來浪漫主義的一派，他和理性成為短兵相接的形勢，如果他不能排斥理性，理性會起而把他推倒。他的學說如果站不住，那只是一首富於想像的史詩，足以令人欣賞罷了。羅索謂戰時法國的維琪政府與柏格森的思想有關，因為注重行動，一意孤行，在政治上必致　向於保守派。</p>
<p>（七）工具主義　培根首創智識即權力之說，想利用科學上的發明發現，達到人定勝天的目的。理論科學的目的在於了解世界，應用科學的目的在於改造世界。應用科學與實際政治發生影響，起於十八世紀之末。因機器的製造，機械的遝輸以及煤力油力電力的應用，生產大盛，瀑布可成爲動力，沙漠可以變成花園，彷彿天下無不可爲之事。近代機械文明進步的速度，與大規模生產的發達，尤以美國爲首屆一指。美國杜威（John　Dewey一八五九年生）的哲學就是反應着這個時代的工業文化，縱素名之爲工具主義的權力哲學。社咸把探討的歷程作爲眞理的代名詞，過分注重功效，自不能免於以成敗論英雄的見解。羅素以爲人事的成敗利鈍未必皆可述覩。如果事事必求效果，效果又有效果，無窮追問，必無是處，工具主義的流弊與浪淺主義相接近，所不同者，杜威不像尼采一派從個人糊力着想，而是從集體權力着想，但都是一種權力哲學。羅素會引孫太耶那（Santayana）批評杜威的話，謂其「瓦解個人，粉粹眞實，」以示　備資者之意。社威一派陶醉於科學的權力無限，未免太過，羅素對之抱有隱憂。現在世界各國的戰爭潛力因科學技術的精進而有加無已，假使沒有防止戰爭的方法，結果恐將趨於普遍破壤的厄運。</p>
<p>（八）邏輯分析派（Logical　Analysis）這一派是二十世紀初年相對論和量子論發明以後與時俱進的新哲學。綜合本放經驗，分析本於邏輯，以邏輯分析來命名，可以表示這一派的思想方法。現代物理學因原子說的成功，而减少其物質的意味，心理學亦因生理學的進步而减少其心性的意味，兩者相向而趨，心與物二者並無嚴格分野，無所謂物，無所謂心，惟事（Event）而已。這種簡單化的新宇宙觀，稱爲中立一元論（Neutral　Monism）也可稱爲惟事論。這一派　代表人物當推羅素本人。他以爲哲學應以科學方法實事求是，但需要比科學更進一步。科學只間原因，不問目的，只問部分，不問全體，哲學所以補科學所未逮。文藝復興以前的科學家，專問目的，致使科學陷於絕境，固然是不足爲訓。現代受科學鼓勵的新哲學，又往往着眼於工具與技術方面，所謂「惟力是視」，而於目的不深加考慮，亦有流於狂妄之弊。羅素以爲今後的新思潮必須權力哲學對症發藥，以救其偏，對於上述各派要能採其長而去其短，凡智慧與行動，功利與動機，政治人權與經濟人權，都要兼收並蓄，不趨極端。至於上古和中古的哲學，其中也有許多千古不磨之眞理，需要調和融合，以收集大成的目的。羅素綜論天人之際，以為希臘畏天，中古尊天，近世重我，現世重羣，各有宏旨，不可偏廢，科學不能包攬一切。他爲近代科學技術進步的結果，世界原已化成一體，但政治社會的結構，未能與之相副相應，大戰之原因在此·羅素理想中的新哲學在世界觀是主張中立一元論或惟事論，在人生觀則主張綜合上古中古與近古，並且進　綜合東方與西方，必須知新以溫故，方能由舊而轉新，有這樣健全的新哲學，以爲新文化的樞紐，方能適應原子時代的要求。民治不是沒有缺點，但在各種政制中缺點最少，國內需有民治，國際亦應如此，世界方能長保和平。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c166">叔本華的敎育論 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 少雄</p>
<p>十九世紀　　叔大集（A．Hur　Schopcnharue）是一位天才　人，也是一位著名的悲觀論者。他的悲觀論也許我們不　贊同，可是他關於其他方面的論斷，則常有深入的觀察，獨到的見解，我們不　加以抹煞。在他的論文集裏，有一篇論敎育的文章。這篇文章　現代敎育家的理論頗有相同之處，很値得我們加以介紹。這是本文的目的。</p>
<p>我們知道叔本　在哲學上是一位理想主義者。他是繼承康德，而對康德之說有所修正的。可是　敎育主張上，他却傾向於經驗論。他認為敎育方法有兩種：一是自然的敎育法，一是人為的敎育法。所謂自然的敎育法，就是注重特殊的觀察，特殊的經驗，為　　普遍觀　或知識的方法。人類的普遍觀念是從特殊的觀察抽象而得。這是要在特殊觀察之後，經　相當時間才能得到的。一個沒有敎師，也沒有書本的人，其獲取知識，就是全依　他自己本人的經驗。這樣的人便很知道他的時殊觀察，那些是隷屬於某一普遍觀念，及為某一普遍觀念所代表。特殊觀察　普遍觀念兩方面，他都知道得很淸楚，他不會弄錯，因而他　　在正確的觀點上去處理任何事件。這是自然敎育法的優點。反之，所謂人爲的敎育法，就是注重口說，注重書本，以普遍觀念的注入爲主的方法。這種方法乃在人類尙未和宇宙的本身有廣泛　接觸，尙未自行觀察之前，即去聽師長的口說，去學習，去讀書，把腦海　充滿了許多普遍觀念。你的師長且會吿訴你說，構成這些普遍觀念的特殊觀察，將在你以後的經驗中獲得。然在特殊觀察沒有獲得之前，你却把普遍觀念錯誤的遝用着，你却從錯誤的觀點去判斷人和物，且以錯誤的見解錯誤的方式，去觀察牠們，土處置牠們。所以這種敎育法便歪曲了人類的心靈。</p>
<p>敎育不運用自然的方法，而且運用人爲的方法，這說明了爲什麼有許多讀霄多而有學問的人，尙常缺乏常識，尙常判斷錯誤，或行動錯誤。原因是，這種人雖充滿了許多抽象　普遍　觀念，他却開始去運用，也就很難正確的運用。他所受的敎育，違反了心靈的自然發展，即由且體而到抽象的發展，顚倒起來，以抽象觀念的注入爲先，而以特的觀察居後。這種敎育，不先去發展兒童認識的機能，不先敎兒童自行觀察，自行思維，但用全去把人已成的思想，已有的觀念，强行注入兒童　中去。這樣，兒童長成之後，臘中所有的只是那些他人的抽　觀念，而這些觀念又決難　是正確的，有許多是錯誤的。有了這些觀念先入爲主，後來的經驗雖可加以糾正，却難完全加以糾正，也不容易加以糾正。這樣光只有抽象觀念的人，當他親自觀察到　實　他的抽象觀念相反時，他可以視專　為部分的，爲不完全的，而加以拒絕；他也可以完全忽視專實，否認事實　他的抽象觀念有矛盾，極力去保全他的抽象觀念。有許多人所以終身都爲偏見，幻想，錯誤的觀念，所糾纏而不能自拔，其理由即在此。要糾正人類的錯誤觀念，這種敎育法必須先加以糾正。</p>
<p>叔本　認爲正確正教育法，須順乎人類心靈的自然　展，也就是當以自然的敎育法爲主。根據這種敎育法，特殊的觀察當　普遍觀念之前，較狹的觀　當在較廣的觀念之前。任何觀念的灌轍，均當依　觀　構成的程序，而不能　等。我們所當　給兒童的觀念，必須爲兒童所能自行觀察的觀念，無論如何，必須可爲觀察所微實　觀念。這樣，兒童所得的觀念雖少，却皆是有根據而正確的。這樣，兒童便可學習怎樣去運用自己的標準，而不是他人的標準，以判斷事物。他可以遍免許多誤解和偏見。所以敎育兒童之道，不應先以書本置諸兒童之前，而應先令兒童逐步和事物接　，和人生的實際　境接觸。我們的工作在指導兒童，獲得關於宇宙的淸晰而客觀的見解，也在指導他們直接從實際生活中獲得他們的觀念，且使他們的觀念和實際生活相符合。我們當設法使兒童不要從書本，從童話，從他人的言說中，獲得他們的觀念，因從這樣得來的觀念，多半是錯誤，多半是和實際生活不合的。敎育的主要任務在此。因而，叔氏主張當兒童年齡未到十五歲以前，一切抽象科目意見較爲紛歧，錯誤較爲可能的科目，如哲學，宗敎等等，都不可授。所可授的是，意見較爲一致，錯誤較小的科目，如數學，自然科學，語言，歷史等等。前一類科目的敎授，須待兒童長成，有充分經驗及有判斷能力之後。甚而小說一類的書，叔氏都不主張令兒童閱讀，因兒童得容易受小說的影響，而構或許多錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>叔本華的敎育論，略如上述。他的見解，雖有可議之處，然一般　來，是正確的，是和當代教育家理的論一致相合的。</p>

<h3 id="c167">快樂和煩惱 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 仲明</p>
<p>世界上很少從沒有煩惱過的幸遝兒，却有的是從來不知道快樂爲何物的不幸者，當你接觸到周圍任何人的時候，你多半會發覺他們正在爲某樁事情煩惱着，自然，你自己往往便很可能是其中的一個。</p>
<p>人是　　「快樂」和討厭「煩惱」的，然而煩惱的事却並不因此而對你顯得疏遠，相反地牠仍會隨時降臨到你的頭上來，使你無法擺脫。因爲這個緣故，所以常有人嘆息自己不再是一個天眞無邪的孩子，他們以爲祗有孩子才是不知煩惱和最快樂的天使，成年的人是永遠和「煩惱」牽連在一起的。也有人有感於塵世間的煩惱旣無法隔離，便把心靈寄托於宗敎上面，希望在「神」的保佑之下得到一點快樂和溫暖。更有一般享樂主義派的人物，覺得人生旣短暫，又煩惱，如不及時行樂，實在枉度此生，於是恣意於聲色犬馬之間，取得一些感官上的刺戟，也就是他們所引以爲滿足的「快樂」。</p>
<p>無疑地，他們所想望和追求「快樂」的路綫是完全走錯了。希望回復孩提時代去過一種不知不覺莫名其妙的「快樂」生活固是幼稚的想法，而以爲信了宗敎便有快樂之神自天而降，也實在是一種錯誤的觀念。因爲即使是最應驗的「上帝』，有時也還不能拯救你脫離一切現實的「煩惱』的。至於一般享樂派所追求的快樂，那更是令人覺得可憐和可悲的了，因爲他們根本就沒有懂得人生和快樂的意義。</p>
<p>眞正的快樂是要由許多種條件配合起來的，沒有一種健全的人生觀，實在談不上有什麼快樂可言。這許多配合的條件便是你的學識，修養，對付現實和適應環境的本領。健全的人生觀決不會單純地眷　於孩童時代的生活，也決不會糊里糊塗的便把一顆心獻給了「上帝」，或是把所有的精神全消耗在縱情享樂上面。健全的人生觀可以吿訴你什麼事情應該思索，什麽事情不必多想，以及怎樣去解除不可免的煩惱，從而進人快樂的境界。</p>
<p>煩惱常常是精神上一種不必要的損失，一個具有智慧的人是不曾把寳貴的生命讓牠在煩惱中過去的。一位有錢的先生囚爲自己一張房屋義　劵沒有中獎懊惱不置，一位太太因爲少生一個兒子或是得不到一隻幾克拉鑽戒而飲恨長嘆，都是一種不必要的煩惱，因爲牠對你只有損害，沒有任何的補償和建樹。</p>
<p>不錯，在人生的旅程中常會碰到許多不能使你快樂的事情，但是你應當運用你的智　和勇氣來渡過這重難關——一次再一次，戰鬥下去。同時，在克服和消除這許多煩惱的時候，如果要想假借別的力量來帮助你，那還是不可靠的，爭取快樂還有待於你自己。</p>

<p>馬克吐溫的寫作生涯開始的時候，雖然有些小名聲，但是收入依舊非常微薄，有時往往連生活，也感到十分窘困。</p>
<p>一次，當地有一個喜劇角兒願以美金五十元作爲酬勞，請馬克吐溫替他寫出半打「笑話」來供給劇中應用。不料這位風趣的幽默大師立即拒絕了，並且對那人說道：</p>
<p>「假使我接受這樁交易，我倆的名譽都要掃地了！」</p>
<p>「這和我倆的名譽有什麽關係呢？」喜劇角兒非常疑惑地問他。</p>
<p>「假使你上台來演出了六個很精彩的笑話，那麽觀衆必定以爲你是偸了別人的。他們會說你是一個竊賊！至於我，却是一個很窮的人，常常是囊空如洗，假使給人發現了我身上有五十柴金，必定也以爲是偸得來的錢，他們同樣的呌我「竊賊」。這樣一來，我倆豈不都名譽掃地了嗎？」</p>

<p>自由談已刋過一篇孫鶴先生談飛碟的文章，說去年的飛碟實在是美國的學術國體試騐火箭武器。但在本月二十五日又讀到「飛盤」在瑞士上空出現的新聞：「瑞士通訊社稱：昨日下午瑞士東北部威恩費登村天空，發現巨型光球一枚，向南疾飛而去。其後在瑞士中部，又見帶有長尾之發光飛盤，向西直飛而去……本社記者自都林乘火車赴羅馬，亦見彗呈狀之物在天空飛行，雖火車聲隆隆，仍可聞該物飛行時之巨聲。」</p>
<p>事實上，在過去的一百年中，報章雜誌時常刋有神秘「飛行物」出現的消息。一般人都以爲「飛盤」是最神秘莫測的了，但較之以前在天空中出現的飛桶。飛豬·飛馬·飛蟒·飛人·飛鈴……，「飛盤」眞是何足道哉。但是爲什麼人們對於「飛盤」特別感到驚駭呢？一言蔽之，都是由於戰後國際局勢的動蕰不寗，人們也就變得比較敏感得多了。</p>
<p>據說在一八七八年，美國佛基尼亞州西部有一位晨天，他親眼且睹一隻白色有蠶翅的馬，飛過他的頭上。一九〇五年，在　爾琪地方許多居民都看見一雙約十呎長的豬，飛越上空而去。</p>
<p>一八七三年，在塔克賺斯州有許多農夫開始驚惶失措起來，因為在光天化日之下，竟有一條粗大的蟒蛇飛過他們的頭上·一家紐約報紙對於這件事，斥爲最「荒　無稽」之談了，但是不久以後，堪　斯州竟亦有「飛蟒」出現。</p>
<p>一八八一年，佛基尼亞州和德拉瓦州的居民，都看見一位穿有制服的士兵和一位白衣小天使，疾速飛過天空。</p>
<p>最令人感到詫異的事，莫過於飛「雪茄烟」了·一八九七年四月九日夜間，在芝加哥上空出現一件像「雪茄烟」形狀的東西，生有復大的翅膀，並且還發出紅·白·靑三色光綫。</p>
<p>科學家亦都目睹「飛雪茄烟」的出現，有一位科學家解　這件飛物是南天星，由於大氣的影響，而發出三色光綫，但是這位學者並沒有說明，還什麽祇有甫夭星才受大氣的影響呢？</p>
<p>其後在四月十九日晚上九時，佛基尼亞州的雪斯脫難地方，東北角上有紅白靑三色光出現，透過光學玻璃　察所得，這東西是　錐體形狀的，約有一百八十呎長。</p>
<p>這「飛雪茄烟」究竟是什麼東西？「飛蟒」又是何物？諸如此類的問題，祗有這樣的回答：天空的神秘猶未坼穿，至今依然是一個令人迷惑的「謎」·（本文取材於二月份皇冠雜誌）</p>
<h3 id="c170">探母五派 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 倚虹</p>
<p>四郎探母是平劇中最流行的一齣好戲，由坐宮到回令，其中佔了兩個生角（四郎六郎），三個且角（蕭太后鐵鏡公主四夫人），一個老旦（佘太君），小生（楊宗保），兩個丑角（把關者），根本是生旦並重的齣頭。原先四夫人是正旦，公主爲花旦，陳德霖飾四夫人爲二黃正板，王瑤鄉飾公主，出塲僅唱西皮搖板，確是配角的地位，但是後來公主變成正旦，升爲主角，四夫人反倒成爲配角了。四郎與公主在劇中都是主角，不過這齣戲是由生角主演的，公主也只能算是副主角了。老生演唱探母的共分五派，即汪桂芬·孫菊仙·譚鑫培·劉鴻昇·許蔭棠是也·這五派的演法，各有不同的優點，如今寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）派汪　桂芬又稱汪大頭，他出演探母，還在同治年間，那時的唱法，沒有什麼花腔，講究的是滿弓滿調，字正腔圓，在西皮正板「楊延輝坐宮院」以下，照例有一個小過門，才能唱出「自思自嘆」四個字，汪派的唱法，减去這小過門，在小過門的夾空中，用腔調補上，將自思自嘆四字，一氣阿成，沒有眞正衷氣，絕難應付下來，這是汪派唯一特點，並且尾香都發自於鼻管，善於運用鼻音者祗有汪桂芬一人。以後王鳳卿亦學注派唱法，因唱中無花腔，不爲社會所喜。</p>
<p>（二）孫派　孫菊仙天津人，平津均呼之爲老鄕親，又稱之爲孫一樂，蓋孫爲劇人中之樂觀派也·其視粉墨登塲爲遊戲之作，無論某一戲劇，其唱做均十分草率，然恃有寬亮之嗓音與充沛之衷氣，放音時能聲震屋瓦，經遏行雲，悲壯激昂，不同凡響，遂亦能自成一家。其演探母之最大優點，在能拖長腔，見娘時唱「去到後帳看一看娘的兒媳兒的妻去去就來」之來字，能拖腔至進場，到後台時，餘音嬝嬝，前台猶能隱約聞之，其衷氣充沛有如此者，是爲孫派一大特點。嗣時慧寳演探母，亦有「火車頭」之稱，蓋即指「來」字能拖極長之尾腔也。</p>
<p>（三）譚派　今日之演探母者，其中花腔百出，推陳出新，殆即宗於譚派。譚以軟腔取勝，每一段落均有其優點，行腔處均能盡抑揚頓挫之能事，是後哭堂時之腔調，悲愴欲絕，耐人尋味。其後余叔岩雖略有改進，然仍未脫譚派之窠臼·現譚富英·楊寳森所演者，亦折衷於譚余之間。惟馬連良所演者，又有多少變換，大致仍未軼出譚派範圍。譚派探母，優點最多，可以稱爲最完善的了。</p>
<p>（四）劉派　劉鴻昇為票友出身，探母一劇為其拿手之一，劉聲調高亢，發音甜潤，如正板如元板以至於流水，均係一氣呵成，在「站立宮門呌小番」之番字嘎調，尖銳直上，毫不費力。哭頭用高調，亦與譚派相反。其胡琴調門恒在乙字以上，與之充配角者祇有陳文啓·吳堃芳·吳彩霞數人而已，馬福仙為其配探母公主，終因調高吐血而死。</p>
<p>（五）許派　許蔭棠爲張二奎之弟子，其所演爲奎派老生，以選元戎一劇爲其特長，無人能演·探母亦能自成一派，其唱調完全爲一本正經之王帽老生，吐字沉著，發音穩重，乃成爲一種笨唱，較汪孫兩派尤不受歡迎，爲時代中之落伍者，故學許派探母者已無一人。</p>

<h3 id="c174">自殺在美國 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>每隔半點鐘，在美國就有一個人自殺。在戰時，自殺的百分率比較低，也許是因爲職容易尋，大家忙碌，少有沉思默的機會。可是，當經濟蕭條之際，尋死的人就多了。在一九二九年，美國股票市場崩潰的時候，流傳着一個「笑話」：有一家高大的旅館，每逢客人來租房間的時候，茶房是先小心翼翼的問一聲：「先生，您租居房間用來睡覺，還是用來跳樓？」</p>
<p>在美國每年發生的十萬件自殺企岡中，有兩萬名主角得以如願以償。他們大多數都起於突然的衝動，通常是在恐慌之中。有些醫生說，三分之一的自殺者不是神經錯亂，就是醉漢病夫。不過，一般的說來，百分之八十的美國的自殺者都是由於感情上的或者金錢上的煩惱。但金錢的動機却是錯綜的——因錢少而自殺的竟比因沒有錢而自殺的多。顯然的，美國人能够忍受眞正的貧窮，却難以忍受對貧窮的恐懼。</p>
<p>有人問：沒有比跳樓更好受的自殺的方法嗎？——何以跳樓是最普遍的自殺方法之一？下面的例子可以給我們一個解釋：</p>
<p>數年之前，有一個名呌約翰·華德的靑年，偸偷的爬上紐約一家旅館的十七層樓中的狹窄的窗　。他的姊姊發狂的懇求他爬回來，但是，他不理，於是，她將警察喚了來。可是，他們都抓不到華德，無法將他拉回來，又怕迫得太緊，反而逼他跳下去。華德的姊姊和警察一同苦口婆心的勸他爬回來，他非但不聽話，並且還對他們瞎扯，甚至取笑·一直僵持了幾個鐘頭，華德才在衆目睽睽之下，縱身躍到十七層樓下，結束了他的生命。這充份的表現絕端的「顯示主義」（Exhibitionism日），正所謂是「死出風頭」。</p>
<p>男子自殺的數量比女子多三倍。男子採取比較激烈的手段，例如槍擊和上吊。至於女子準備結束她們的生命的時候，如同有一個公約存在其中似的，很少採用會毀壞她們的容貌的方法，她們似乎是「死要面子」。</p>
<p>美國各州的法律大多數都認爲企圖自殺是有罪的。在紐約州，帮助和敎唆自殺是第一等的殺人罪，最高本刑要判廿年徒刑。</p>
<p>美國人組織了不少的防止自殺的社團。根據他們的經騐，陌生人勸誡厭世者比熟人有效。他們又發現，如果將厭世者的自殺的念頭拖延幾天，或者甚至幾個鐘頭，大部份都會消失掉自殺的決心，重新做一個人——殺的企岡十九是一時的衝動，衝動是暫時性的，它一消失，就是逼着企岡自殺者再去尋死，他也會畏縮不前。</p>
<h3 id="c175">春天不是讀書天 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>

<h3 id="c176">改姓換名 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 清雷學圖</p>
<p>一九四五年之夏，德意志全盤崩潰，全境入同盟軍掌握，希特勒不落不明，或云自盡而屍體無從確認，或云逃往阿根廷，或云逃往東洋，淌況迷離，盟軍之搜索緝拿，自是當然之舉。此後即見歐洲電訊「希特勒」之弟，具呈盟軍當局，聲明改姓「希勒」，以省煩擾而免牽棄。此事令人失笑，乃大驚險武劇一種有興味的小穿挿。</p>
<p>「希特勒」Hitler若改「希勒」Hiler，只須减去一字母T，其姓之音便逈然不同。除非其本人有何罪行，即不致代其兄受捕提之苦。此種情形，若以中國事例參之，則更改名姓，避嫌遠禍之原則略同，而方式則異。</p>
<p>按「希特勒」，姓也。其名則爲「阿道耳夫」，故通常雖稱Hitler，而署名於正式文件（如對蘇宣戰），則須寫全姓名，Adolph　Hitler。其弟則爲「阿魯士希特勒」AloysHitler，旣不同名，自無改姓之必要。若此希弟亦　戰犯，則其本身即有受捕治之資格，改姓亦復何用。彼旣公然呈請改姓，則盟軍未曾認為戰犯，而彼亦自間無所疑畏，其呈請改姓，完全受他老兄之累可知也。</p>
<p>若在中國，爲避嫌而改名者有之，爲避嫌而改姓則少見，且無須也。例如汪兆銘，汪時璟，都姓「汪」，都是「逆」，然時璟之被捕判罪，並不因爲姓「汪」，並非受累於兆銘，乃自己的罪行所致，假使兆銘之弟兄未嘗附逆，即是無罪之人，其姓名決無問題。但如另一人亦姓「在」，亦名「兆銘」，則必忐忑不安，兆銘雖不似希魔有生死之謎，而此「另外之汪兆銘」亦必自動「改名」，以避刺激，然亦決不至「改姓」，至於「阿魯士希特勒」之改姓則爲避免牽累，確有甚大之作用。原因還在中西人姓名之音讀的原則，有根本之差異。</p>
<p>希特勒平常只稱希特勒，其「阿道耳夫」閒冷少用。其弟平常亦只稱「希特勒」，其「阿魯士」亦是冷宮裏的東西。所以只要一聲「搜補希特勒！」則此希魔之弟即可被「拉拉扯扯到公庭」（玉堂春戲詞），與其到官後再聲明「阿魯士」，不如趁早先把「希特勒」去了一個字母，變爲「希勒」，可省許多麻煩。若中國之好逆，除非是同名者疑權，同姓者儘可放心。中國人常例稱呼名號，不單呼姓，即如一校同學羣居終日，彼此互呌「老張，老李，小汪，小王」，亦須於姓上加「老」「小」等字，以湊足一口氣兩個Syllables。若希特Hitler則一字之中就有兩個Syllabies，故同名者易涉嫌疑，因是平常就慣以「姓」爲總稱，而所以用姓爲總稱者，與中國之並稱姓名同一原則（音度律所限定）。</p>
<p>中國帝制時代，有許多避諱皇帝的「御名」照例要「敬缺末筆」，例如「溥儀」之「儀」，須少「義」下之一撇。（淸宣統年所印之書尙多存者，其中遇此皆少一筆。）如乾隆之「弘曆」，其「弘」須改去末筆之點，其「暦」中之「禾」須改爲「木」，總以「鈇筆」爲常例（改寫亦有之）。中國字之缺筆，只是形體上之差異，與音國無關係，西字係拚音字，故减少字母，其音　便大不同·然亦要看何等字母，是何位雙。如希特勒去「特」變爲「希勒」，固矣。如希姆勒Hmmler縱然去一M，仍然是「希姆勒」，必須去兩個M，則是又一個「希勒」矣·（希姆勒即希特勒之秘警隊長，第一心腹，戰後被捕吞藥藥水自殺的那個傢伙。）</p>
<p>中國從前官廳文書於盜匪及其他凶犯棍徒之名字，常須增加筆墨，以免累及好人。例如淸光緒年間粵督奏辦盜犯「羅幗章」，其「幗」之「巾」旁即係官方代加，因「國章」之名甚爲普通，若犯人未就捕，則同姓名者難免受牽累，被訛詐。即犯人已捕治，同姓名者亦難免晦氣惡心，遠道親友更離免誤會驚疑，故加筆爲冷僻之字，則無此患。如山東海船刧案「朱苡仁」之「草頭」加「以」，浙江刑事犯「周萇綠」，陝西盜案之「張恫文」，其名之中間冷字，皆一望而知爲增筆　「御名」之減筆爲「敬避」，而匪名之增筆爲免累也。</p>
<p>中國古代亦偶有改姓避禍之事，如常州張惠。。翰林作文林郎惲君呈誌云：「惲本楊氏，漢平通侯惲，其子違難，以父名爲氏，是曰貞道，爲梁相，後遷於毗陵之黃山而葬焉，子孫世爲毗陵人。」按漢代楊惲，字子幼，因報孫會宗書詞意憤激，致被　　受審，彼時刑罰野蠻，動輒「夷族」「連坐」，其子孫不敢姓「楊」而取其名爲姓。常州惲姓，至今仍爲大族，淸代惲家翰林甚多。又七七事變前，北平晨報主筆生寳堂兄，談及其姓之由來，原爲年大將軍羹堯之後，年大將軍爲淸雍正所忌，賜自盡後，子孫恐懼，遂將「年」字減筆為「生」。此與「希特勒」之減字母之例，不盡相同，亦足備相互參卷之資料。故邊類而並記。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The inaugural session of the First National Assembly of the Republic of China grandly opened at 11:00 AM on the 29th at the National Assembly Hall in Nanjing.

Starting at 7:00 AM, the streets of the capital were already filled with a fresh atmosphere. National flags fluttered everywhere, and special cars for the National Assembly representatives transported them from their accommodations to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to participate in the memorial ceremony held at 9:00 AM. For a time, the road to the mausoleum was filled with a continuous stream of vehicles. By approximately 8:00 AM, all the representatives had arrived. At exactly 9:00 AM, to the sound of elegant music, Chairman Chiang, dressed in formal attire, ascended on time, looking radiant. Then the memorial ceremony began.

<h3 id="e3">Chairman Chiang's Opening Address: Grasping the Key Points, Understanding the Future of Constitutional Government <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Chairman Chiang delivered an address at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly on the morning of the 29th. The key points are as follows: (1) The purpose of the National Revolution is to build China into a Three Principles of the People nation: of the people, by the people, and for the people. However, internal and external troubles have arisen repeatedly, hindering the implementation of democratic constitutionalism. The history of revolutionary nation-building is filled with hardship, difficulty, sacrifice, and struggle. The Constitution of the Republic of China is a crystallization of blood and tears. Having established the Constitution, we must eliminate obstacles and guarantee the success of constitutional government. (2) The Constitution can be divided into three major parts: first, the rights and obligations of the people; second, the political organization of the state; and third, the basic policies of the state. These three parts constitute the content of "of the people, by the people, and for the people." The foundation of the Principle of People's Sovereignty lies in the nation, and the purpose of the Principle of People's Sovereignty is democracy. We should grasp this key point to understand the future of Chinese constitutionalism. (3) According to the provisions of the Outline of National Reconstruction, after the National Assembly holds the general election, the National Government will transfer authority to the elected government, thus completing the great task of nation-building. But what is the biggest obstacle to our nation-building? The Communist Party opposes the Constitution and opposes the National Assembly that implements constitutional government, willingly becoming a sinner against democracy. To ensure the success of constitutional government, we must make every effort to suppress the rebellion. (4) This National Assembly is the first session under the Constitution. The Constitution has just been implemented, and the advantages and disadvantages have not yet been specifically experienced for reference in amendments. Therefore, the mission of the Assembly is only to exercise the right to vote to complete the organization of the government of the Republic of China. Each sacred vote cast by each representative represents the people. The responsibility of protecting the people's freedom, implementing basic national policies, and safeguarding the territorial sovereignty of the Republic of China has been entrusted to the constitutional government. I wish the Assembly success. (Full text published on page 2)</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] After the National Assembly opening ceremony, our reporter approached Premier Zhang Qun and asked for his feelings. Zhang repeatedly said, "Very happy, very happy." He also stated that the task of the transition government he leads is nearing completion, and the transition government will end when the new government is established.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun attended the opening ceremony of the National Assembly as a representative. After the meeting, when asked by reporters, he expressed his feelings, saying: Since the government was reorganized and its foundation expanded last April, it has actively promoted the work of implementing the Constitution. During this period, it encountered many difficulties and obstacles. Thanks to the unity of the people and the government, and the cooperation of various political parties, the National Assembly has opened on schedule today, which is a great event for the country. The task of the Executive Yuan after the reorganization was to serve as a bridge from political tutelage to constitutional government during this transitional period. In the past eleven months, precisely during a difficult and turbulent time, the Executive Yuan's measures have been diligent, but the effects have not been as expected, and it deeply feels inadequate to meet the eager expectations of the people. However, in the preparatory process for the implementation of constitutional government, the work that the Executive Yuan should undertake has fortunately been largely completed. After the start of constitutional government, the burden of the Executive Yuan during this transitional period will be lifted, and the nation's new destiny will begin. My joy is not limited to personal feelings alone.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Zeng Qi's Remarks <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the China Youth Party, issued a statement after attending the opening ceremony of the National Assembly, saying: "The Republic of China was founded 37 years ago, and only this year do we have a formal Constitution and the establishment of a formal popular opinion institution. And a popularly elected government will be generated according to the Constitution. This is the first step for the country to enter "modernization" and "democratization." The results of the arduous efforts in the past are due to the country having wise leaders, the people having a unified demand, various parties and factions and social elites having a common will, working together, united in purpose, fighting hard, not swayed by superficial opinions, and not disheartened by internal strife, and then can we enter the constitutional stage. How should we value this grand event? I hope that the members of the National Assembly will act in accordance with the powers granted by the Constitution, based on the principle of "selecting the virtuous and capable," treat it seriously, elect the President and Vice President to lead the people, promote constitutional government, and establish a formal "popularly elected government" with broad "inclusiveness" and "constructive power" to deal with a group of troublemakers who are fond of making trouble, who have "international backing," and who use force as a tool for political struggle. Before the Second National Assembly, we should strive to create a nation of universal welfare, so as not to fail the sacred mission entrusted to us by the people."</p>

<h3 id="e7">National Assembly Representatives' Concessions Dispute Comes to an End <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Occupiers of the venue withdrew yesterday morning</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The issue of signed National Assembly representatives has been gradually resolved in part. The ten representatives who intended to occupy the assembly hall and demonstrate with a hunger strike on the 28th, after several hours of persuasion by Zhang Lisheng, Hong Lanyou, Chen Lifu and others, left the venue at around 4:00 AM on the 29th and have now moved to the Fifth National Assembly Hostel. Subsequently, after the efforts of Yu Bin, Mo Dehui, Hu Shih and others, and a decision to study the matter further as a remedy, Chairman Chiang summoned the hunger-striking representatives at 4:30 PM on the 29th and reiterated his views on the issue of concessions, believing that two points were worthy of consideration: (1) Regarding the concession of women's groups, there was a misunderstanding that the sixth-place delegate should concede instead of the fifth-place delegate. This point can be considered; (2) Representatives from re-election constituencies can also be considered. As for the decision of the party to concede to the party, the Chairman solemnly stated that it could not be changed, even if he would not be the first president, he could not change it. By 7:30 PM, three of the representatives, including Li Luojiu, were willing to concede on the spot and immediately resigned and returned to the Fifth Hostel. Yu Bin again persuaded them to eat, and the representatives reluctantly ate an orange. The signed representatives then reconvened and sent representatives of the statutory faction to express their condolences. As for Ma Wenyuan, who had been resolved, he also reported to the registration office at around 9:00 PM in the evening.</p>

<p>It is not yet known what position Kong Xiangxi will hold, but it is pointed out that he was the Deputy Premier during the war, when Chairman Chiang himself devoted himself to military affairs, and the entire administrative responsibility was entrusted to Kong.</p>

<p>[Our Paper, Nanjing, Ding 9th] Shanghai National Assembly representatives and other professional organization representatives produced in Shanghai, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiqing, Qian Xinzhi, Qian Dajun, Wang Xiaolai, Zhao Dihua, Zheng Tonghe, Jiang Jianbai, Xi Yushu, Li Ximou, Feng Youzhen, Zhao Junhao, Xu Xueyu, Zhu Ping, Shui Xiangyun, He Yuanming, Chen Cunren, Zhou Feicheng, Jin Zhenyu, Wang Shanxiang, Zhang Danping, Lu Yinchu, Fan Shouyuan and over 200 others, said that this National Assembly is convened as the first National Assembly to implement the Constitution, opening a new page in the constitutional history of China. The gathering of over 3,000 representatives is of great significance. According to the task of the Assembly, which is to elect the President and Vice President, the nomination announcement of the President and Vice President each requires three days, a total of six days of announcement time. They specifically suggest that the Assembly take advantage of this opportunity to hold a current affairs review meeting, in which representatives from all units across the country and overseas can elaborate on the sufferings of the people, review the gains and losses of military, political, and economic conditions in various places, so as to contribute to the suppression of rebellion and the building of the country, and enable the government after the reorganization to understand the people's suffering and gain reference in policy implementation. The representatives also said that the convening of this National Assembly costs unlimited talent and financial resources. If it does not make substantial contributions, it will not be able to comfort the expectations of the people across the country. Therefore, after this news spread, representatives from all provinces and cities unanimously agreed and placed great expectations on it.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] National Assembly Anecdotes:</p>
<p>(1) When the National Assembly representatives visited the mausoleum, Chairman Chiang slowly ascended the steps, rested briefly midway, and was surrounded by photography reporters together with Chairman of the Council Weng Wenhao. Minister Zhu Jiahua arrived and also joined in "being photographed."</p>
<p>(2) Li Zhongshan, a representative from Xijing City, was very old and frail. When he passed by the Chairman, the Chairman immediately ordered someone to help him up Zijin Mountain.</p>
<p>(3) When the Assembly representatives visited the mausoleum and paid tribute to the fallen soldiers, some women representatives scrambled to stand in the front row to catch a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor.</p>

<h3 id="e15">A New Page in Chinese History <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper (Nanjing, March 29th)</p>
<p>"The convocation of the National Assembly is the most important event in thirty-seven years."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said this in his opening address at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly. The convening of the National Assembly, leading the country into a constitutional era, and the return of government to the people by the National Government is the ultimate goal advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his National Revolution. The achievement of this goal is indeed the most important event in the thirty-seven years of the Republic of China. However, to broaden the scope, the convocation and implementation of the constitution by this first National Assembly is also a brand new page in the five thousand years of Chinese history. Let us see how this page is written in such a solemn and glorious manner.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven years ago, on March 29th, the revolutionaries of the Chinese Kuomintang failed in the Guangzhou Uprising. However, this failure in spring laid the foundation for the success in autumn. The revolutionary martyrs threw their heads, spilled their fresh blood, to strive for the realization of their ideals, which finally became apparent to the world thirty-seven years later. The selection of March 29th as the opening day of the first National Assembly is of great significance. When Chairman Chiang led all the national representatives to pay respects at the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation and to offer sacrifices to the revolutionary martyrs, the fallen soldiers, and the deceased compatriots, it reminded people of the countless internal and external troubles in the course of the National Revolution and recalled the corpses, blood, and sweat on the way. It further highlighted the heavy burden of democracy recorded on those two occasions.</p>
<p>The 29th was blessed with Nanjing's best weather this year. From midnight to dawn, messengers from the National Assembly Preparatory Committee sequentially knocked on the doors of every representative and every hotel, rushing to deliver notices for the 9 o'clock visit to the mausoleum, the 10 o'clock spring sacrifice, and the 11 o'clock opening ceremony. The night mist slowly rose, and the bright stars disappeared into the increasingly dense fog. Around 8 o'clock, nearly a thousand cars, large and small, sped through the mausoleum area. People surged onto the stone plaza and steps of the Father of the Nation's mausoleum like a rising tide. Approaching 9 o'clock, the sunlight suddenly broke through the heavy fog, precisely allowing the good news of the implementation of the constitution to be brought to the spirits of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs in a gentle breeze and bright sunshine. The new page of Chinese history was also revealed under the reflection of the blue sky and white sun.</p>
<p>Around 11 o'clock, the National Assembly no longer had the usual desolation of the past year. The rows of cars flowed continuously in front of the illuminated sign decorated with neon lights that read "Long Live the Republic of China." People wearing silk ribbons of various colors talked and laughed as they stepped into the gate of the assembly hall, where the national flag gleamed and the red light letters "The World is for All" shone above the door. In the corridor, directly in front were two registration desks for the representatives, and on both sides were signature areas for guests, government leaders, and foreign guests. The post office and telecommunications bureau were still staffed by the same old people who had served during the preparations for the National Assembly. The three large vermilion gates with gold trim at the front of the assembly hall were wide open, and the couplets gilded with "To Establish the Republic" and "To Advance Together" looked even more magnificent. Upon entering the venue, the mercury lamps illuminated the stage and most of the assembly hall. In the center of the backdrop on the stage was a large national flag, flanked by two gilded models of the constitution and bas-reliefs of auspicious millet. In front of the flag stood an oil painting of the Father of the Nation, accompanied by potted cypresses on both sides. Further in front was a long table with a vase of fresh flowers on display. Near the front of the stage was the chairman's desk, and on both sides of the stage were two large national flags. In addition, the venue was decorated everywhere with national flags, silver-painted models of the constitution, and auspicious millet designs in various sizes. The blue, white, and red colors reflected the lights on the milk-colored walls, showcasing a scene of splendor, solemnity, dignity, and auspiciousness. In such a venue, the writing of a new page in Chinese history began. The downstairs was filled with male and female representatives, and the upstairs was occupied by deputy ministers from various ministries, Chinese and foreign guests, and standing committee members from the Nationalist, Youth, and Democratic Socialist parties. At 11:30, the opening ceremony began amidst melodious music. Chairman Chiang delivered the opening address, and after the elderly Mr. Wu Zhihui led the representatives in taking the oath, the ceremony concluded amidst music.</p>
<p>The first National Assembly has finally opened. On this day shining with the glory of the revolution—March 29th—looking back on the days before the opening, it was truly like the heavy fog that filled the night and morning. As the rituals and music of the opening ceremony began and ended, people once again saw the joy of the blue sky and white sun breaking through the fog. The attending representatives were naturally delighted, as were the officials who handled the elections and preparatory affairs, and the officials responsible for the transitional governance before the implementation of the constitution. During the days of gloom, the resolution of election disputes, the choices of politics and laws, and the discussions on the seats for party representatives heavily weighed on people's minds, requiring painstaking resolution. Several key officials were busy and tired until late at night, but ultimately relied on Chairman Chiang's appeal, the Kuomintang's discipline, the individual sacrifices of Kuomintang members, and the sincere cooperation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties to resolve all existing problems. China's implementation of the constitution is not only a new page in Chinese history but also a major event in the democratic world. The diplomatic envoys of various countries in Nanjing, led by French Ambassador Mr. Meyrier (the senior ambassador of the Nanjing diplomatic corps), attended the ceremony with joy and in full dress. France is the country of origin of democracy, and Ambassador Meyrier felt very honored to be able to participate in the ceremony and sit in the first seat in the foreign guests' section. He praised the development of democracy in China to the utmost. American Ambassador Dr. Stuart said that this was an unprecedented event and that the National Assembly, as a democratic institution, would bring benefits to the Chinese people. British Ambassador Sir Steven repeatedly said, "Good, of course good." Indian Ambassador Mr. Menon, who was about to return to his country, was even more pleased to be able to attend this grand event before his departure, and he shook hands tightly with reporters.</p>
<p>"Wonderful! I am extremely happy. I hope China's democratic government can work hard to achieve national stability."</p>
<p>The first National Assembly has opened. Under the world's attention, the new page of Chinese history has been smoothly written and is being solemnly written down. Standing from the people's perspective, we wish the assembly success, because the success of the assembly is the success of the people, and Chinese history has begun another new era.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Editorial: Cultivation of Reason and Will <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 5th Youth Day. All sectors of the city held grand celebrations, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Everyone who participated in the celebrations placed all of China's hopes on the youth. However, when we calm down and think about it, we find that many of today's youth exhibit emotions of bewilderment and restlessness, and a sense of turbulence and chaos, making it difficult to see again the spirit of enthusiasm, courage, and perseverance that characterized the revolutionary struggles and the War of Resistance against Japan. We certainly do not want to be overly critical of the youth, but we are extremely sympathetic to their distress. Therefore, we are eager to take this opportunity to analyze the main causes of their problems and offer a word to intellectual youth, hoping that the youth of the whole country will, from today onwards, resolutely concentrate their energies on the cultivation of reason and will. In his letter to the youth of the country, Chairman Chiang also said: "First, young people should carefully examine and discern, and clearly recognize the enemies of the nation. Young people should have passionate emotions, and at the same time, they should have rich reason."</p>
<p>The contradictions and turmoil of the times, and the social unrest that occurred after the War of Resistance, seem to be the main causes of anxiety for the well-meaning youth. However, these factors are the same for all aspects of society. Looking at the changing international situation and the unrecovered wounds of war, there is also economic recession in Western countries. Why is the expression of distress and anxiety among Chinese intellectual youth particularly serious?</p>
<p>Young people are particularly rich in emotions, so they are easily enthusiastic and easily disappointed; they can be guided to do good and accomplish things, but they can also easily deviate and act rashly. In Chinese society, where the level of knowledge is low and organizational strength is weak, emotions are even more likely to run wild and fail to be properly directed. After the May Fourth Movement, the youth were liberated from the old ethics, and a surge of vigorous enthusiasm did indeed have the effect of promoting social progress. However, our imitation of European and American new education generally focuses on form and "interest," while neglecting the "will training" that China has always valued, and has not fulfilled the "cultivation of reason" achieved by Western culture since Greece, which is the so-called tradition of "love of wisdom" and "seeking truth." Therefore, our youth's emotions have been developed, but they have no way to be expanded and purified. Once they encounter dissatisfaction or resistance in life, their emotions lose their moorings, and two tendencies easily occur: the cautious become depressed and decadent due to disappointment, and the sharp-minded become restless and reckless due to stronger feelings of resentment. The basic reason for the lack of vitality among the majority of today's youth, and the reckless and unconventional behavior of some young students, lies here.</p>
<p>To reverse the decline and bewilderment of the youth, and to prevent them from going astray, laws, punishments, or formal moral training are no longer sufficient. We must devote ourselves to the cultivation of "reason" and the tempering of "will" in education and in the youth's self-training.</p>
<p>First, let us talk about the cultivation of reason: China's current school education, especially the university education that imitates European and American systems, originally focused on imparting reason. Although the university tutorial system is well-intentioned, its effectiveness has not been significant to this day. In recent years, many educators have believed that the mission of modern universities should be centered on "reason," and have questioned the need to take into account moral training. We believe that if the training of morality must be taken into account at the middle school stage to supplement the education of knowledge and ability, then higher education, if it can truly implement the education of "reason," will naturally be sufficient to complete the entire personality education, because blind obedience and reckless action are mostly due to a failure to understand the principles of things: if there is genuine insight, it can naturally develop into great benevolence and great courage. However, unfortunately, precisely this training of reason, such as the ability to use thought, carefully judge, and distinguish right from wrong, is generally felt to be lacking within the walls of today's schools. They often lightly believe what they hear from rumors, and act rashly because of light belief; or they are muddled and indecisive, or they hesitate and watch from the sidelines. The Confucian scholars of the past taught us the method of investigating things to extend knowledge, the so-called "extensive learning, careful questioning, prudent thinking, and clear discrimination," which focused precisely on "thinking" and "discrimination"; unfortunately, today's intellectual youth are the least good at using reason to think and to discriminate. We only need to look at the causes of the recent university student movements, which are often that a small number of people have a set of training for their aims and are brave enough to cause trouble, so that the majority are timid and afraid to do good. The confusion of the power of rational thinking can be said to be the main cause of the chaos in education and the social environment. Young people should think: the failure of the country's politics to get on the right track is precisely because the distinction between right and wrong is not clear; if the habit of light belief, the superficial attitude, and the acts of attacking and insulting become the fashion of intellectual youth, then how can politics be clear in the future, and how can democracy be realized? Understanding this, young people should know the importance of establishing the foundation of thinking and discernment with "reason."</p>
<p>Secondly, the tempering of will is complementary to the education of reason. The Chinese sages taught people to place the greatest emphasis on setting goals. The so-called "upholding aspirations" and "encouraging aspirations" are actually efforts to strengthen and refine after seeing the principles clearly. If one's aspirations are not firm, then one can only see the current phenomena, but not the distant and grand aspects. One cannot withstand setbacks, and one can easily fail to achieve success. The great achievements of many great men in history are due to the teachings of their loyal and long-suffering mothers; the outstanding achievements of many scholars originate from the arduous efforts of poor scholars; the repelling of enemies and the expansion of territory by many famous generals are based on the unwavering spirit of courage. This is clear evidence that will can generate great power. Young people are rich in years and strength, and their future is bright. If they have reason to establish their foundation, they must use their will to achieve their goals. All those who lack patience and are easily disappointed, lack perseverance and are sporadic in their efforts, are lenient in blaming themselves and harsh in blaming others, and only know how to benefit themselves but cannot benefit the group, are all signs that they understand the principles but their will is insufficient. Only the youth with the most abundant willpower can avoid negativity, avoid inconsistency, avoid being cowards, and not be "hypocrites." By extension, they can "act courageously for what is right" and can easily achieve the state of "riches cannot corrupt, poverty cannot move, and might cannot subdue."</p>
<p>In analyzing the uneasy emotions of today's intellectual youth, we naturally cannot ignore the factors of the times. However, past education, imitating England and the United States, only liberated the emotions of the youth; and while imparting knowledge, it failed to temper their ability to think and discern, which is indeed a major factor. Only by understanding reason can we guide the emotions of the youth onto the right track, and only by encouraging will can we refine the emotions and reason of the youth and lead them to action. The work of correcting imbalances and rescuing shortcomings in the future depends on the efforts of educators in general; but striving to be better, and doing one's best, aspiring youth will not want to blame heaven and others, but can examine their gains and losses, and make painful efforts in the direction of "understanding reason" and "encouraging will."</p>
<p>Those who are knowledgeable are not confused, those who are benevolent are not worried, and those who are courageous are not afraid. Benevolence is the full-person realm of the moral cultivation of the Confucian scholars of the past, and knowledge and courage are at least what our youth can learn and approach. In today's changing world, in order to seek a way to stand on one's own feet and serve the country, we must deeply establish reason, so that we will not be confused by the chaotic phenomena; we must establish will, so that we will not be afraid of the threats of all external forces. Without confusion and without fear, we will naturally have the determination to deal with chaos and the power to adapt to changes. What need is there for depression and anxiety?</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The New York Times today published an editorial entitled "China Convenes a Constitutional National Assembly," praising Chairman Chiang's efforts in democratic work, and strongly urging Congress to quickly pass the aid-to-China bill so that the Chinese government can resist the threats of the Soviet Union and the Communists. The newspaper also predicted that the president elected by the National Assembly in accordance with the Constitution would undoubtedly be Chairman Chiang, and said that Chairman Chiang led China through the Great War and internal strife. Although he has been repeatedly slandered as a dictator, he has indeed ended China's period of political tutelage, and has managed to pass and supervise the implementation of the Constitution. This is truly his greatest achievement in his life. The newspaper also specifically pointed out that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly strived for the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, which the US government has insisted on, but has not achieved results. However, he continues to strive to expand the organization of the government by inviting the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties to participate in the coalition government. In order to invite the various minority parties to participate in the government, Chairman Chiang agreed to give these parties a number of representatives that exceeded what they should have according to their strength. To this end, he had to restrain the Kuomintang members from running for election so that the various minority parties could have enough representatives elected to meet the agreed number.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Full Text of the Chairman's Address at the National Assembly Opening Ceremony <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The National Assembly News Group reports: Chairman Chiang delivered an address at the opening ceremony of the First National Assembly, First Session, on the morning of the 29th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Today, our First National Assembly is convening. All of you have come from various regions, entrusted by voters nationwide, to exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution. This marks the beginning of democratic constitutionalism in the Republic of China. It is also the goal that the Father of the Nation sought to achieve through over fifty years of sacrifice and struggle in leading the National Revolution. Today's gathering is not only a major event in the history of the Republic of China but truly a landmark event in Chinese history. I am deeply gratified to be able to participate in this sacred and solemn celebration.</p>
<p>Cherish the Value of the Constitution, Remove Obstacles to Democracy</p>
<p>The purpose of the National Revolution is to rescue China from peril, to seek freedom and equality for China, and to build China into a Republic of the Three Principles of the People: of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is also the shared responsibility of all representatives today. The Father of the Nation once said, "The so-called Republic should not concern itself with the name of the Republic but with the reality of sovereignty residing in the people." The Father of the Nation also said, "The meaning of the Three Principles of the People is government of the people, ownership by the people, and enjoyment by the people. The country is owned by the people, politics is managed by the people, and benefits are shared by the people." To thoroughly realize this great ideal, the Outline of National Reconstruction was established to awaken the national people to struggle together. However, in the thirty-seven years since the founding of the Republic, internal and external troubles have arisen one after another. Initially, there were remnants of the imperial system and warlords from the Northern Warlords who usurped the country. Then there was the invasion of Japanese imperialism. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we encountered the rebellion of the Communist bandits, who deliberately subverted the Republic of China and implemented the dictatorship of the "mob." These reactionary forces have all exerted their full power to obstruct the implementation of our democratic constitutionalism. Our history of revolution and nation-building can be said to be filled with a history of arduous struggles and sacrifices. The Constitution of the Republic of China, which we promulgated last year, can be said to be the crystallization of blood and tears. In the past, we have broken through layers of resistance and overcome various difficulties to produce this Constitution. In the future, we must cherish the value of the Constitution, remove obstacles to democracy, and ensure the success of constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Not to Emphasize the Beauty of the Articles, But in the Complete Implementation</p>
<p>The constitutionalism of all countries in the world has gradually developed, improved, and enriched itself to reach a state of perfection. The Constitution does not emphasize the beauty of the articles but the complete implementation. The Constitution of the Republic of China can be mainly divided into three parts: first, the rights and obligations of the people; second, the political organization of the state; and third, the basic policies of the state. These three parts also constitute the content of ownership by the people, government by the people, and enjoyment by the people. Only when the people have the ability and habit to exercise political power, understand the value of the people's rights and freedoms, and fulfill their obligations to the state can the foundation of the state be firmly guaranteed, and the state can become a state owned by the people. Only when a close and full relationship is established between the people and the government, allowing the people to have power and the government to have ability, and jointly following the path of the Constitution, can the political organization of the state fulfill its proper function and become a tool for promoting national policy. Only by formulating basic national policies in accordance with the interests of the entire people and the entire country can the people strive to pursue a common ideal to achieve progress and prosperity. These three parts are closely related and inseparable. The history of constitutional development in all countries of the world has proven that political democracy cannot be separated from national independence, nor can it be separated from the happiness of the people. As far as China is concerned, the basis of the Principle of Democracy lies in the Principle of Nationalism, and the purpose of the Principle of Democracy lies in the Principle of People's Livelihood. The history of China's democratic movement is first to strive for the independence and equality of the nation and ultimately to guarantee the rights of the people and enrich the lives of the people. If you grasp this key point to understand the future of our country's constitutionalism, you will find that the political measures after the implementation of the Constitution must aim at realizing basic national policies, must be based on improving the lives of the entire people, and must also be based on guaranteeing national survival and the foundation of the state.</p>
<p>To Ensure the Success of Constitutionalism, We Must Exert All Efforts to Suppress the Rebellion</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Father of the Nation's Outline of National Reconstruction, after the promulgation of the Constitution, a national election will be held, and the National Government will transfer power to a government elected by the people, marking the completion of the great task of nation-building. However, our implementation of constitutionalism today, in terms of economic construction, in terms of social construction, and in terms of cultural and educational construction, can only be said that the work of nation-building has a basic foundation and can make further efforts with national policies as a guideline, but it cannot be said that nation-building has been successfully completed. Representatives of voters from all regions must recognize what is the biggest obstacle to our nation-building and what is the biggest obstacle to our democratic constitutionalism. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, we have been working hard on reconstruction, while the Communist bandits have been destroying and obstructing everywhere. At the same time, we have been actively preparing to convene the National Assembly and the work of drafting the Constitution, while the Communist bandits initially restrained, then refused, and finally openly rebelled. Last year, after we promulgated the Constitution, the Communist bandits believed that once China implemented democratic constitutionalism, they would not be able to implement their so-called class dictatorship of selling out the country and harming the nation. Therefore, they brazenly opposed the Constitution and the National Assembly, and they willingly became enemies of democracy and enemies of the country, launching a more insane armed rebellion and a more cruel massacre and destruction. Today, we begin to implement constitutionalism to plan for the long-term security of the country, while what the Communist bandits want is chaos. We want to protect the lives of the people and the survival of the nation, while what the Communist bandits want to create is hunger, poverty, and destruction. Therefore, I believe that today the state and the people should attach equal importance to suppressing the rebellion and implementing constitutionalism. We will not delay the implementation of constitutionalism because of suppressing the rebellion. On the contrary, we must exert all efforts to suppress the rebellion to remove this obstacle to nation-building and the enemy of democracy because we want to ensure the success of constitutionalism. Representatives, after examining the current situation of the country, will surely have the same profound recognition.</p>
<p>The Mission of This Assembly Is to Exercise the Right to Elect</p>
<p>This National Assembly is the first assembly after the implementation of the Constitution. The Constitution has just been implemented, and there is no concrete experience to provide reference for modification. Therefore, the mission of this assembly is only to exercise the right to elect to complete the organization of the government of the Republic of China. According to the spirit of our Constitution, the responsibility of the constitutional government is to protect the freedom of the people and implement basic national policies, and its most important task is to maintain our democratic republic system, maintain national sovereignty, and restore territorial integrity. Representatives, in exercising your powers in the assembly, each sacred vote cast by each representative represents the people of the Republic of China, entrusting the responsibility of protecting the freedom of the people and implementing basic national policies, as well as the responsibility of maintaining the democratic republic system and maintaining national sovereignty, to the constitutional government. At the same time, it also means entrusting the responsibility of removing obstacles to democracy and eliminating obstacles to nation-building to the constitutional government. Today's suppression of the rebellion is a war of democratic constitutionalism against the dictatorship of the mob, and it is also a war of saving the country against betraying the country, and saving the people against harming the people. At such a critical moment, and at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, the responsibilities of the people and the constitutional government are particularly important. I sincerely hope that the representatives will understand the true needs of the country and the people, faithfully express the will of the people, solemnly exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution, and establish a good foundation for the beginning of constitutionalism. I wish the assembly success.</p>

<p>More than 30 People Captured, Currently Under Interrogation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] Around the Lunar New Year this year, many organizations and groups in this city, as well as prominent social figures, received New Year's cards signed "Beiping Liberation Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Subsequently, even more absurd statements with the aforementioned signature were received, such as "New Year's Message to Beiping Workers" and "Warning to the People of Beiping" signed by the "Investigation Team for War Criminals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," but the printed paper was extremely crude, and some were mimeographed. The Investigation Department of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters recently cracked down on the entire organization, seizing on the spot the seals and stamps used for the aforementioned documents, the complete mimeograph machine, and the copied cards and propaganda materials, as well as various pro-Communist books. It is reported that more than 30 people have been arrested in this case and have been sent to the Investigation Department for interrogation. The interrogation is being intensified around the clock to ensure that no one is wrongly accused and that no one escapes justice. Details will be announced soon.

<p>Technical Issues Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] It is reported that in order to expedite the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, the authorities have transferred 20 customs officers from Qingdao and reorganized the Kowloon Customs personnel. There are also plans to establish a customs checkpoint in Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong, to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts. It is reported that on the technical issues, the Hong Kong side still insists that it should account for 40% of the proceeds from the sale of smuggled goods seized in Hong Kong's Jinghai, but all anti-smuggling personnel and customs checkpoint expenses are to be borne entirely by our side. This is tantamount to increasing our burden, while the Hong Kong side is increasing a large amount of treasury tax revenue. Therefore, this issue is still under discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Hong Kong Currency Circulating in South China, Authorities Seriously Cracking Down <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Regarding the circulation of Hong Kong currency in South China, which hinders our country's currency, the Ministry of Finance reports: due to the convenient transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, Hong Kong currency has previously circulated in Guangzhou, Shantou, and other nearby areas. In recent years, the exchange rate of Hong Kong currency against our national currency has been rising, and the public has been storing more Hong Kong currency. Guangzhou even sells goods at Hong Kong currency prices, which has hindered our country's currency. The Guangzhou Financial Administration has been cracking down on this seriously, and it has been improving day by day. Except that there is no clear written law to crack down on the public's storage of Hong Kong currency, the import and export of foreign currency is limited to 100 US dollars in accordance with the Bank of China's regulations on foreign exchange management. As for the use of gold banknotes for transactions, they should be confiscated in accordance with the regulations on the management and punishment of gold and foreign currency trading. These all have legal restrictions and crackdowns. Given time, considerable results can be achieved.</p>

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 29th] Beiping military police set up a cordon at the entrances and exits of Peking University on the 29th, prohibiting people from passing through to prevent student parades. Representatives from various universities in Beiping originally planned to gather at Peking University to protest the Executive Headquarters' order to disband the Student Federation. The authorities feared that once students gathered, they would definitely hold a parade, so they took precautionary measures in advance.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Li Zongren First to Announce Candidacy for Vice President Li Zongren <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] General Li Zongren's participation in the vice-presidential election can be considered a vanguard. While factions in Nanjing were still negotiating over the distribution of National Assembly delegate seats, we received news from the north that General Li had publicly announced his candidacy for vice president.</p>
<p>General Li's early announcement demonstrates his bold and heroic spirit. However, General Li said, "Why am I announcing so early? It is to advocate for democratic politics. I hope to create a democratic atmosphere through this. As for success or failure, that is another matter." General Li clearly possesses the demeanor of a statesman. He also stated that success or failure is not the point. An election is like playing basketball; winning and losing are inevitable, and a shot will sometimes go in and sometimes miss. This open-mindedness cannot be cultivated in a day.</p>
<p>General Li is a capable general. The implementation of the "Three Self" policies in Guangxi in those years enabled Guangxi to transition from relying entirely on others to becoming self-sufficient. The leaders in promoting the "Three Self" policies were the so-called "Three Heroes" at the time, namely General Li, the current Minister of National Defense Bai (Chongxi), and Huang Xuchu, who is still in Guangxi Province. The three worked together to coordinate military, government, and civilian affairs. General Li is not a purely military man; this should be made clear here. At the same time, General Li uses this as his rallying cry. He says that although he is a military man, he is capable in politics. He cares about politics, he understands politics, and he has political ambition. Therefore, some people say that since the President is a military man, the Vice President should be a civilian, implying that General Li is not suitable for this condition. However, he is a talented individual with both military and civil capabilities. Furthermore, some people use regionalism, saying that since the President is from the South, the Vice President should be from the North. General Li happens to be from the South again. However, General Li uses facts to explain that although he is from the South, he presided over the Beiping Executive Headquarters and stayed in Beiping for two years. Moreover, he himself has no regional bias.</p>
<p>He not only cares about politics but also has considerable research on politics. While in Beiping, he had already started paying attention to studying the current political ills. After flying from Beiping to Shanghai, he published his opinions on reforming politics. Upon arriving in Nanjing, he discussed this issue during his first meeting with reporters. His view is this: "Our country has reached this point. If we still cannot find the source of the patient's illness to treat it, are we just going to watch him die?" He also affirmed, "I have my own views, I have insights from my research and observations, and I will definitely contribute new ideas to the new government."</p>
<p>If I were to criticize General Li, I could say, "General Li is not strikingly handsome." His height, appearance, etc., seem to be average. You don't detect any extraordinary charisma in him. As for his speech, his voice is light and soft, with a Guangxi accent. If you listen carefully, you will easily understand him. He never utters outlandish remarks. However, General Li has achieved the extraordinary through the ordinary.</p>
<p>General Li's participation in the election gives him considerable strength, yielding a North-South echo effect. Look, as soon as the news of General Li's candidacy was announced, didn't the support from various political parties start in the North? The support from compatriots in the North especially illustrates the gains from his handling of political affairs and further demonstrates that there is nothing inappropriate in a Southerner governing for Northerners. Therefore, I say that General Li's problem seems to be a problem that isn't a problem. I think General Li's strong campaign power means that even those who, as he himself put it, are older and more virtuous, may not necessarily be like him.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Swedish Ministry of Defence Approves Five-Year Plan To Enhance Air Force and Strengthen Defence Moscow Pays Attention to the Development of the Situation in Northern Europe <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 28th] Due to the changes in the international situation, Sweden has taken measures to strengthen its defence. The Ministry of Defence has approved a five-year plan to significantly increase the number of air force personnel, and General Jung, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, has requested the construction of new fortresses, airfields, and the conscription of more soldiers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] The Soviet Army newspaper Red Star reprinted a report from a Danish Communist newspaper, stating that Sweden has concluded a secret military agreement with Britain and the United States, and that Swedish warmongers are creating an atmosphere of war domestically. It is said that the agreement stipulates that Sweden and other Scandinavian countries have agreed not to acquire costly bombers, but will provide bases for American heavy bombers in the event of war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 28th] The Soviet Army newspaper "Red Star" and the Navy newspaper "Red Fleet" today accused the Swedish military authorities of planning to build bases for American aircraft and said that warmongering groups are trying to control the Swedish government. "Red Fleet" published an article by commentator Semenov, stating that Swedish Army Commander-in-Chief Jung is planning to use the Swedish army as an appendage of the American military apparatus and to subordinate Swedish foreign policy to America's expansionist ambitions in Northern Europe. Jung's plan is to (1) build new fortifications and airfields in northern Sweden for American aircraft and paratroopers; (2) include the Swedish Air Force in the American Air Force system; (3) mobilize industry based on the import of American strategic materials; (4) increase the number of trained officers and soldiers with American weapons. The Soviet newspaper Izvestia also criticized Norway yesterday for planning to lease military bases to the United States and Britain. At a time when Finland and the Soviet Union are negotiating a treaty of friendship, it shows the Soviet Union's attention to the situation in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 28th] The Communist Party newspaper "Land og Folk" commented on the recent military measures of the Danish government, calling them "a good show," the purpose of which is to merge Denmark into the Western bloc on the one hand, and to obtain loans to expand Denmark's military equipment on the other. It is also learned that the Danish Minister of Defence also commented on these military measures, saying that Denmark's future defence plan should focus on strengthening the air force, and the navy should have small formations and submarines.</p>

<p>[Our Report] New York Broadcasting, 29th: Washington News, Presidential Press Secretary Ross declared that the rumour that President Truman, Prime Minister Attlee, and Marshal Stalin might hold a meeting in Berlin is not true. Truman has no plans to leave the United States.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 28th] London's "Sunday Illustrated" reported on the 28th that President Truman, Prime Minister Attlee, and Marshal Stalin may meet in Berlin in mid-June to draft a plan to prohibit war. It is said that Truman and Attlee will support holding a three-power conference in Berlin, while Stalin seems to favour holding it in Moscow and will insist on a plan to stop the Western European alliance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Political circles here predicted on the 28th that President Truman may soon embark on a world tour to gauge the reactions of various foreign capitals to the development of America's new foreign policy. President Truman's staff has privately stated that this trip could increase President Truman's political capital in the November election, but the source stated that President Truman himself has not mentioned any plans for this trip.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Istanbul, 28th, Associated Press] The local newspaper "Homeland" stated, according to semi-official sources, that US President Truman will visit Turkey and Greece next month. Truman's trip indicates that the United States will first aid all countries threatened by the Communist Party. The US President will travel on the cruiser "Augusta" and will have a special plane for his occasional needs. However, local officials have not made any comments on this matter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Florida Democratic Senator Pepper, who repeatedly made pro-Soviet remarks last year, also bluntly accused the Soviet Union of invading its neighbours in a radio broadcast today, which offended America's sense of freedom. Pepper said that we are on the brink of war, and President Truman should meet with Premier Stalin face-to-face to make a final dramatic effort for peace. Truman should present Stalin with an American peace plan, including (1) calling on all countries to stop practising physical and ideological aggression; (2) guaranteeing to provide our country's economic assistance to compliant countries. This is not appeasement. I do not believe in appeasement. Before the United States aids the Soviet Union, it should obtain assurances that this assistance will not be used to attack us.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Five thousand Irish people held a demonstration in London today against the division of Northern and Southern Ireland. Major Vivion de Valera (a lawyer), son of former Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera, delivered a speech to the crowd on a bombed-out wall. The crowd held signs with slogans such as "I want our country, England, you need our friendship, our condition is a unified Ireland." Vivion de Valera spoke vehemently, calling on the crowd to engage in a final attack to rebuild an independent and unified Ireland. "We are not kidding. The border between Northern and Southern Ireland must be abolished. This move affects the blood of every Irish person in the world." He warned Britain and the United States. He said that if Britain and the United States were to clash with Eastern Europe, they would hope that the Western front would be united, but if Ireland were divided, tensions would not be eliminated. Irish Ulster government member McCarthy accused the Northern Ireland government of implementing police rule. He demanded the immediate release of fifty Irish political prisoners imprisoned in Britain and Northern Ireland. Ulster League President Captain Ireland pointed out the disadvantage of a divided Ireland to Western countries. He said that if Ireland could be unified, it could form a military alliance with Britain, France, the United States, and the Western European Union, so that the weak point in the Atlantic Iron Curtain could be filled.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, a certain place in the occupied area of Southern Trieste Port, 28th, Associated Press] More than a thousand Yugoslavs conducted combat exercises today on the plains adjacent to the British and American occupied area of the free zone of Trieste Port. They practiced with machine guns, practiced infantry tactics, and listened to methods of using mortars. Through binoculars, reporters observed this vast plain for four hours and saw that this river valley had actually become a large training ground for various ground forces of the Southern nation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Trieste, 28th] British and American officials revealed that the Yugoslav economic delegation of the free zone of Trieste Port, citing the illness of some members, refused to quickly decide on a date for a meeting with the British and American economic delegation of the free zone of Trieste Port. This meeting is usually held once a week to discuss economic and general issues. It is the only remaining regular contact between the British and American sides and the Yugoslav area. When revealing the above news, British and American officials stated that the British and American sides had accepted the explanation provided by the Southern side and did not believe that the meeting had been declared over.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Soviet Union's Atomic Energy Control Plan Rejected by the Four Great Powers Still Hope the Soviet Union Will Propose New Proposals as a Basis for Discussion <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] The four countries of China, Britain, France, and the United States suggested today that the Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan be rejected. British representative Miles, on behalf of the three powers of China, Britain, and France, and with the tacit approval of the United States, solemnly informed the Soviet Union in the United Nations Atomic Energy Working Committee that continuing to discuss the Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan would no longer serve any useful purpose. The Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan has been under discussion since last June. Its content advocates the establishment of an international control authority under the Security Council to control the mining of atomic materials, the manufacturing of atomic bombs, and the right to inspect various atomic factories. The four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and France support the establishment of an international agreement to establish an international atomic control agency not subject to the jurisdiction of the Security Council to avoid the exercise of veto power. Miles read a statement from the four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and France in the working committee today, stating that the Soviet Union's atomic energy control plan is useless and insufficient to prevent the danger of atomic war. After a detailed study of the Soviet Union's plan, the four powers have confirmed that there is no need to continue discussing it. The Soviet Union's proposal cannot be accepted as the basis for international control of atomic energy. Miles stated that the Soviet government has not only failed to propose an appropriate atomic energy control system, but even declared that it will not agree to the establishment of a control system until all atomic weapons are prohibited and destroyed. It must be known that it is completely impossible in fact to ask any country to destroy its existing atomic weapons before obtaining assurances that all countries will be prohibited from manufacturing atomic weapons.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 29th] The four-power proposal does not mean a final and formal rupture with the Soviet Union on the entire atomic energy control issue. The four powers are still prepared to discuss new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the future and lay the foundation for a comprehensive debate on the atomic energy issue at the United Nations General Assembly to be held in Paris this autumn. It is deeply felt that the time has come for the General Assembly to use its moral power to break the deadlock.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Sydney, 28th] British atomic bomb expert Professor Oliphant, who came here to assist the Australian National Research Council, believes that there will be no war for at least five years. He said that the only country in the world with a large number of atomic bombs is the United States. The Soviet Union may be able to manufacture two or three in the next five years, but at least hundreds are needed to fight a war with atomic bombs, which cannot be achieved without many years of effort. As far as Western countries are concerned, if they want to launch a relatively confident major offensive against the Soviet Union, they still need several years of preparation. Therefore, it is said that the world will definitely not have a real war in at least five years, and in these few years, it may be possible to negotiate and try to resolve the war problem. Referring to atomic power generation, he believes that atomic power generation can compete with coal-fired power generation in ten years. If the world's electricity is to be completely derived from atomic energy, it must wait at least twenty-five years.</p>
<h3 id="e61">US Aid to Europe and China Merger Bill Can Be Passed by the House of Representatives Vandenberg Expresses Disagreement with Embargo Against the Soviet Union <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] US Senator Vandenberg and the State Department are deeply worried that escalating trade wars with the Soviet Union may endanger the European recovery plan and are extremely anxious about this. This anxiety is based on the belief that the response from Congress to the United States transporting aircraft engines into the Soviet Union is enough to prompt the House to take active action to cancel aid to Western European countries that trade with countries behind the Iron Curtain. The most anxious Senate leaders and State Department officials are the amendments proposed by House member Mundt to the House Foreign Affairs Committee bill.</p>
<p>The amendment orders officials presiding over foreign aid cases to cancel US aid to any Western European country that ships wartime valuable materials to the Soviet Union or its vassal states. The House will begin reviewing the amendments in its merged foreign aid bill on the 30th and is expected to hold a vote on the 31st to pass the bill. House leaders expect the bill to pass by a three-to-one overwhelming majority, after which the bill will be sent to a joint conference of the two houses of Congress to adjust its differences. The Senate bill is limited to the European Recovery Plan, while the House bill includes the European Recovery Plan. Economic aid to China plan. Military aid to Turkey, Greece, and China plan. Vandenberg and the State Department have both publicly stated that restoring pre-war Soviet-Western European trade is a fundamental prerequisite for the success of the Marshall Plan. However, they said that this important assumption is that this trade must have no meaning of being politically controlled by the Soviet Union. Republican foreign policy leader Vandenberg fiercely opposes the shipment of materials with war potential to the Soviet Union, but he agrees with the senior officials responsible for the European Recovery Plan that the shortcomings in the United States' export controls should not be remedied by including restrictive clauses in the amendment. Vandenberg's stance on restoring East-West trade was stated in the Senate on March 1. He said, "The exchange of East-West trade in Europe is necessary for both parties. The restoration of this trade will be beneficial to both parties. There is nothing in the European Recovery Plan that prevents the restoration of trade." The State Department's position on this matter is even stronger than this. In a report submitted to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, the State Department strongly stated that a long-term plan has already been drafted regarding the restoration of trade between the eastern and western parts of Europe. Without this trade, European economic recovery will be slower and more difficult, but it is not something that cannot be achieved."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Wadena, Minnesota, 28th, Associated Press] US House Finance Committee Chairman Knutson recently wrote an editorial in his own "Pioneer Newspaper," titled "Marshall Should Step Down." He attacked Marshall for complete failure in diplomacy and demanded his dismissal. He said that Marshall is arrogant and arbitrary, and his performance as Secretary of State is really unsatisfactory. We have had some great Secretaries of State, and we have also had mediocre and incompetent Secretaries of State, and we really do not consider their performance satisfactory. Marshall is one of them, Knutson said. Marshall is indecisive and difficult to formulate. Our position is becoming increasingly unstable. If we want to avoid war, we must immediately dismiss Marshall. His trip to Moscow was a complete failure. When Marshall saw that the plan for the partition of Palestine seemed impossible to implement, he changed his mind, reversed his original attitude, and abandoned the partition plan, instead advocating that the United Nations should take over Palestine. This proposal is as unenforceable as the partition plan. This is the first time that a member of Congress has publicly attacked the Secretary of State.</p>

<h3 id="e65">U.S. Actively Supports Japan; Early Policies Completely Overturned; Protests from Far Eastern Countries Will Also Be Disregarded <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Mr. Kenyon, a senior policy maker in the U.S. State Department, and the Draper mission recently arrived here. Developments in the Japanese situation indicate a shift in American policy, which now values Japan as the most useful nation in the troubled region of the Far East. While Undersecretary of the Army Draper stated that the mission has not yet reached a conclusion, his recent remarks suggest not only assurances of a lenient peace for Japan but also promises of economic aid similar to the Marshall Plan for Europe. The U.S. policy's excessive emphasis on Japan is completely contrary to earlier American policies.</p>
<p>In the past, American policy clearly contained fears of a resurgence of Japanese aggression. In early 1946, U.S. special envoy Pauley suggested in his report that Japan should not "become again the principal industrial consumer of raw materials from its neighbors, thereby controlling the economic life of its neighbors." Given Draper's recent reiteration of building Japan into a factory for the Far East, Pauley's suggestion has undoubtedly been abandoned. Another of Pauley's suggestions, "that the United States should not take any action that would help Japan maintain a standard of living higher than that of other Asian neighbors suffering from Japanese aggression," has also been discarded. It is rumored that the United States is now gradually granting large-scale economic aid to Japan, and Draper even guaranteed that Japanese industry will exceed the 1934 level. According to sources close to Mr. Kenyon, State Department policy still maintains "Europe First," as in peacetime as in wartime. However, these sources state that Mr. Kenyon believes Japan is more useful in assisting the United States than any other Far Eastern country. The shift in U.S. policy toward Japan originates domestically, but the occupation authorities in Japan also play a role. The Kenyon and Draper mission has been in constant consultation with officials from General Headquarters (GHQ), and GHQ has suggested that Japan must export to its Asian neighbors to maintain national survival. GHQ officials also suggested to the mission that, since Japan is the only country in the East with industrial knowledge, it is more useful in assisting the United States than any other Far Eastern country in any contingency. Undersecretary of the Army Draper stated in Japan that even if other Far Eastern countries raise strong protests, they will not be able to change U.S. policy toward Japan. He told the press that the U.S. aid plan for Japan is unrelated to the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission.</p>

Major General Marquat, chief of GHQ's Economic and Scientific Section, handed a memorandum this morning to Japanese Labor Minister Kato Kanju and Minister of Communications Yoshirouji, preventing the strikes on behalf of the Japanese government, because of their detrimental impact on the economy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Eastern Japan (including Tokyo) is once again at a standstill in telephone, telegraph, and post office services due to another 24-hour strike that began last night. 160,000 telecommunications workers are participating in today's strike, which was called by the government and public utility workers' union federation after government-labor negotiations broke down yesterday. Meanwhile, approximately 200,000 telecommunications workers in western Japan may also strike starting at midnight tonight. Even if this strike becomes nationwide, it will not affect any telecommunications affairs of the occupation authorities.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Forcalquier, France, 28th] A group of young scientists will re-enter the Garaudel cave in the Lower Alps of France today, one of the deepest caves in the world. Last year, the group reached a depth of 313 meters. They hope to go even deeper this time to investigate the actual content and extent of the cave. According to records, the cave was discovered in 1942 by referring to ancient maps. Due to the war, it was not until 1944 that an expedition descended 70 meters. Last year, the second team, equipped with better equipment, descended 317 meters. Today's descent has been carefully prepared and can communicate with people on the surface, so better results are expected.</p>

<p>— (Special Correspondent Huang Jiaozhen, Batavia)</p>
<p>It will soon be three years since the Japanese surrendered. For the past two to three years, the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have endured the hardships of war, death, displacement, and destitution. Since the ship of peace, the "Renville," came to the waters off Java from the United States, the Dutch and Indonesians began negotiations on December 10 last year. After twists and turns and setbacks, and with the political figures of various countries racking their brains, a truce agreement was finally signed on January 17 this year, and the principles of political negotiation were accepted. Turning swords into ploughshares and transforming hostility into harmony, the overseas orphans of the Chinese nation have witnessed the turmoil of this country for years, with innocent Chinese compatriots suffering. Now that the Dutch and Indonesian sides have reached a peaceful and reasonable resolution, how many people cannot help but be overjoyed and moved to tears!</p>
<p>We know that the success of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations means that the Dutch side undoubtedly holds an overwhelming advantage militarily or politically. The repatriation of the Republican Army from the Dutch-controlled areas was completed on the evening of February 22 this year. The total number of troops repatriated was 29,000. The security of the Dutch-controlled areas is expected to be worry-free in the future, and conflicts and attacks may be reduced. The federal government was formally established on the 9th of this month. These facts show that the implementation of the truce agreement is generally smooth.</p>
<p>Planning Schemes on Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>After the Dutch have achieved great success in Indonesia's politics and military, they are now turning their attention to us Overseas Chinese and are planning schemes on us. In other words, after the success of the Dutch political offensive, they are launching an economic offensive aimed at our overseas Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese merchants have started businesses overseas, making a living in foreign lands. They rely on their extraordinary labor or on personal skills, without the protection of the government of their motherland, and are repeatedly oppressed by local governments. After three and a half years of looting and plunder by the Japanese invaders, coupled with two years of the Indonesian independence movement and the chaos of war, the economic institutions of our overseas Chinese are almost on the verge of bankruptcy. Chinese merchants themselves are gradually realizing that their "golden age" has gradually passed, but they have been hesitating about how to respond to the economic offensive of the new situation. Last year's dispute between overseas Chinese merchants and the Agricultural Products Sales Bureau was not resolved reasonably. Now, the Dutch-Indonesian Ministry of Economic Affairs has launched a second offensive.</p>
<p>Dutch Monopoly on Import Trade</p>
<p>According to the Dutch authorities, the main purpose of restricting free trade is to eradicate smuggling and prevent capital flight. We carefully examine their motives and realize that this is a trick performed by the five major Dutch trading firms, who are determined to monopolize and manipulate all import trade. We are quite aware of the fact that Dutch finances have been in deficit and foreign exchange has been depleted since the war. It is not unreasonable to take necessary steps due to the shortage of foreign exchange. However, if it is categorically stated that the devaluation of the Dutch currency in Singapore and Hong Kong is the result of smuggling by overseas Chinese merchants, we can never accept this deliberately accusatory fallacy. The fact is obvious that the important factor in the devaluation of the Dutch currency is that the export of indigenous products from the Dutch East Indies has been strictly restricted and cannot compete in overseas markets, and the reason for the sharp decline in exports is undoubtedly the impact of the turbulent situation.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have always been the most law-abiding. Now, a very small number of overseas Chinese merchants, because they cannot obtain foreign exchange and cannot engage in normal business, have to engage in smuggling. If the situation can be restored to the previous state, the trend of smuggling will definitely disappear. At the same time, we know that this capital outflow is not gone forever. In fact, the Dutch government does not normally issue foreign exchange to Chinese merchants, but the goods imported from Singapore and Hong Kong are shipped into the Dutch East Indies by Chinese merchants batch by batch, prospering the local markets. This shows that what is escaping is capital, and what is flowing in is goods. In the past year alone, according to rough statistics from the customs, tariff revenue was about 60 million guilders, and the unofficial trade cannot be counted. Even if we calculate it at 10%, the tariffs from free trade would also be considerable.</p>
<p>Economic Controls Lead to Currency Outflow</p>
<p>Although the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs has repeatedly stated that restricting imports is only restricting luxury goods and not restricting daily necessities, it is difficult to draw a clear line between the two. Let us not talk about cosmetics, rouge, and lipstick, but only talk about daily necessities. Toothpaste, talcum powder, soap, small mirrors, bone combs, and hair oil are all taxed at 30% when imported. Only face towels and bath towels are regarded as cotton fabrics and are taxed at 10%. From this perspective, daily necessities and luxury goods are almost indistinguishable. If daily necessities that are taxed at 30% are regarded as luxury goods, then if you open a department store at random, "luxury goods" will account for at least 70% or more.</p>
<p>Since the Dutch East Indies fell into Japanese hands, all the materials stockpiled before the war have been consumed by the Japanese invaders for three and a half years, and the remaining amount is limited, which obviously cannot meet the needs of the citizens. In the past, the imports of the rationing bureau could not meet the urgent needs of the citizens either due to the restriction of foreign exchange. Now, our overseas Chinese merchants do not need to use foreign exchange to import a large number of daily necessities for the people, and prosper the local markets. According to reason, this kind of trade should not be strictly restricted. Although the government authorities still have rationing now, it is a drop in the bucket and does not help. For example, if citizens rely solely on rationing for cloth, they would probably have been in rags long ago. As another example, if we rely solely on the Rehabilitation Industry Bureau for caustic soda, perhaps the small industries would have already closed down. The import of other daily necessities is almost entirely through the black market, which circulates in the markets here.</p>
<p>In extraordinary times, economic control is necessary, and its purpose is to seek the welfare of the majority of people and ensure social stability. However, the drawbacks often lie in competing with the people for profit, or even allowing a few people to enjoy the benefits, resulting in the people's distress not being alleviated, and complaints are already rampant. This is what should be avoided in the control policy.</p>
<p>Raise Awareness and Adapt to the Trend</p>
<p>The reporter has witnessed the tragic suffering of the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies after the scourge of war, and they have been subjected to the ruthless attacks of the local government. Therefore, I especially express my infinite sympathy to the overseas Chinese. The reporter hopes that the overseas Chinese will quickly raise their awareness, promote greater unity, and must have a new attitude and a close organization to develop and protect the inherent position of the overseas Chinese. We deeply know that times are different now, the economic situation has fundamentally changed. In the country, regulation is prevalent, and private activities are often restricted. In society, group cooperation prevails, and individual operations cannot withstand oppression. Considering the past and present lifestyles and business methods of the overseas Chinese, there is inevitably a sense of being behind the times and being difficult to accommodate the environment. If we do not work hard to improve ourselves as soon as possible in order to respond to the trend and catch up, then when the opportunity for natural selection comes, we will inevitably be at a loss as to what to do. This is also what the reporter, considering the changes in the world and predicting the future, sincerely wishes to convey to the overseas Chinese everywhere (especially those in the Dutch East Indies), and to call for attention.

<h3 id="e69">Special Pan-American Conference to Discuss South American Colonial Issues; Nine Latin American Countries to Request U.S. Loans <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bogotá, 29th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia stated that the issue of European countries' colonies in South America will be discussed in a special conference, which only related countries can attend. Mr. Bramuglia and Peruvian Foreign Minister Revledo arrived here together yesterday from Lima. The colonial issues to be raised at the Pan-American Conference include Guatemala and Mexico's claims to British Honduras, Venezuela's claim to British Guiana, and Argentina's claim to the British Falkland Islands. Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, and other countries have declared that they will support Guatemala's resolution to strip the British, French, Dutch, and Portuguese of their colonies in the Americas. Venezuelan newspapers have recently been vigorously advocating the recovery of British Guiana. It is expected that the Venezuelan representatives will also support the resolution. Colombia, which decided to remain neutral two weeks ago, also seems to be changing its attitude.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall boarded a plane to Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, on the night of the 28th to attend the Pan-American Conference. After telling reporters that he hoped to achieve important results at this Pan-American Conference, he took off from Washington National Airport on an Army C-54 transport plane. The Marshall delegation is scheduled to arrive in Bogotá on the afternoon of the 29th. Mr. Marshall is the head of the U.S. delegation of ninety members attending the Ninth Pan-American Conference, which is the first conference since the meeting in 1938. Martin, a director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, also accompanied Mr. Marshall. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman will join later. Mr. Marshall said that the widespread participation of representatives from Latin American countries in the conference and close consultations with the U.S. representatives will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the event. It is expected that Mr. Marshall will try to form a solid Western Hemisphere front against Soviet expansion. The Colombian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Barramilo, personally went to the airport to see Mr. Marshall off.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The main agenda of the Pan-American Conference will be: reorganizing the Pan-American system, economic assistance to Latin America, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes over the Pan-American permanent defense organization, and fulfilling the Pan-American Defense Agreement of September last year. However, Mr. Marshall is most concerned about the situation in Europe, where the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Italy and the Middle East will reach its peak this month. The British withdrawal from Palestine is only six weeks away. In his private conversations with the foreign ministers of the American republics, he will seek their support for the U.S. position. Generally speaking, Latin American countries advocate that the United States should take a tough stance against the Soviet Union, so there should be no problem for them to support the new U.S. anti-Soviet policy. However, Mr. Marshall may not be able to grant the economic aid requested by Latin America immediately. Although Mr. Marshall announced that he would request Congress to lend 500 million yuan from the Export-Import Bank to Latin America, he still needs to convince the Latin American countries that the main economic recovery plan must start in Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Gottwald's Speech: The Czechoslovak Coup Filled a Gap; Believes War Will Not Happen <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 28th] Czechoslovak Prime Minister Gottwald stated today that a Third World War will never happen because the peace forces led by the Soviet Union are so strong that anyone who dares to launch a new war will be abandoned by their own people. Mr. Gottwald was addressing the Prague district Communist Party conference in his capacity as chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. He said that the recent events in Czechoslovakia have closed the gap on the line from Stettin to Trieste. This move will have a considerable impact on the working class in the West, whose strength cannot be underestimated. Mr. Gottwald continued that the success in February was largely due to the local organizations of the Communist Party. He recalled that after Czechoslovakia was liberated in 1945, the future tasks of the bourgeoisie in Czechoslovakia were not fully understood, so the bourgeoisie retained some material possessions and political rights. Now the reactionary forces have been completely defeated. Except for a few misguided students, no one is fighting for the plans of the reactionary elements anymore. The majority of farmers have also joined the workers. The future task is to intensify the implementation of socialism. Since the reactionary elements have not been physically destroyed, and we do not intend to destroy them physically, the Communists must remain vigilant at all times. Before the election on May 31, the government's plans, including the constitution, will be implemented, and state-owned measures will become law. The political consequences of the February Revolution will be systematically realized. The purge movement will prevent reactionary elements from gaining an advantage again, but some mistakes in the purge movement must also be corrected. Mr. Gottwald reiterated that the East and Southeast welcomed the news of the Czechoslovak events with satisfaction and pleasure. Although the reactionary forces in the West are gnashing their teeth, the workers in Britain, France, and Italy will gain greater confidence as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e71">No Residual Radiation After Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: U.S. Atomic Bomb Survey Commission Report <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th] Dr. Tessmer, a U.S. Army pathologist and chairman of the Atomic Bomb Damage Survey Commission, released a report today stating that, based on long-term on-site research on the impact of the Hiroshima bombing, the area completely lacks the dangerous radiation remaining on the target ships in the Bikini Lagoon. The second atomic bomb test at Bikini was conducted underwater, resulting in residual radiation. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the first test at Bikini were all conducted in the air, and there was no residual radiation sufficient to cause disease.</p>
<p>Ships and drinking water in Hiroshima Harbor were also not affected by radiation. In other words, from the moment of the explosion, there was no evidence of any other damage. Dr. Aubin of the National Research Council agreed. After the atomic bomb exploded, it produced countless fissionable materials, which were invisible to the naked eye. These fissionable materials were quickly blown away by the wind at an altitude of 1,800 feet, resulting in a completely different outcome from underwater explosions. In underwater explosions, the fissionable materials did not disperse but concentrated, forming a dense fog that adhered to the ship's hull, resulting in residual radiation. Residual radiation can last for a long time without disappearing. The target ship at Bikini Island recently sank, which is why.</p>

<p>Mayor Advocates for Democracy and Freedom, Encourages Youth to Promote the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The inaugural session of the National Assembly convened under the Constitution was grandly opened yesterday in Nanjing. Coinciding with the 5th Youth Day, all institutions, banks, schools, factories, and markets in the city were granted a day off to celebrate. Following a period of continuous rain, the weather cleared, with sunlight shining brightly, and national flags fluttering throughout the city, creating a lively atmosphere. Besides the grand joint celebration ceremony held at the City Gymnasium in the morning, various activities such as speeches, group weddings, and sports events were held at the Youth Center and the Gymnasium, respectively. All cinemas added matinee showings with half-price discounts. All bookstores also offered discounts to youth and students. The Youth Sports Committee hosted a youth social gathering at Yucai Middle School at 7 p.m., featuring various exciting performances, with enthusiastic participation from the youth.</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Commemoration of the National Assembly Inauguration, 5th Youth Day, and Revolutionary Martyrs Meeting was held at the Gymnasium yesterday morning at 9 a.m. More than 2,000 people from all walks of life attended, with a particularly large number of youth and students participating. Mayor Wu, as the chairman, delivered a speech, stating: "Today, the National Assembly is inaugurated in Nanjing, which also marks the 5th Youth Day. After continuous days of rain, the sky has cleared, which symbolizes a bright and limitless future for China. The hope of the people is for China to achieve genuine peace and democracy, the foundation of which lies in the youth of the nation. Commemorating Youth Day today has profound significance. Looking around the world, the divide between the democratic and communist blocs is becoming increasingly clear. Which side the youth choose depends on their wise judgment. Communism is a dictatorship of a small class, devoid of freedom. Democracy, on the other hand, is based on the will of the majority of the people and strives for the freedom of the people. The recently deceased Czech Foreign Minister, the son of the first president of Czechoslovakia, went to his late father's tomb to weep bitterly before his death to defend genuine democracy and freedom, sacrificing his life for his belief. This spirit is truly admirable. Under communist dictatorship, there is no freedom of the press, assembly, etc. To promote the true meaning of democracy and freedom, we must first overthrow the Communist Party. Hitler once said, 'A lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth.' The Communist Party's conspiracies and lies are similar in nature." The mayor then recounted the facts of the "Tongji University Student Uprising," exposing in detail the manipulation and violence incited by a small number of conspirators behind the scenes, and resolutely stated, "Today, we only have two paths: we must choose between 'democracy' and 'communism.' If we want genuine peace and democracy, we must promote the Three Principles of the People and overthrow communism. I am determined to make any sacrifice to strive for this goal, and I hope that the youth will respond and lay the foundation for a democratic China."</p>
<p>Passed Three Telegrams Congratulating the Opening of the National Assembly, Paying Respect to Chairman Chiang, and Comforting the Soldiers</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhao Yangxiong read aloud three telegrams from the assembly congratulating the opening of the National Assembly, paying respect to Chairman Chiang, and comforting the soldiers on the front lines, which were passed amidst enthusiastic applause from the entire assembly. The telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) Congratulating the Opening of the National Assembly: To all representatives of the National Assembly in Nanjing, as the Communist bandits rebel and the nation faces difficulties, the representatives of the inaugural National Assembly convened under the Constitution gather in the capital, with all wise men present, offering advice to the central government, working diligently to improve governance, practicing democracy, reversing the decline, suppressing the bandits, establishing a solid foundation for constitutional government, and accomplishing the great task of nation-building. As the congress opens, the people are encouraged to celebrate the implementation of the Constitution and enjoy the protection of democracy. We send this telegram to express our congratulations and hope you will consider it. Shanghai City Joint Celebration of the Opening of the National Assembly, the Fifth Youth Day, and the Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs Assembly.</p>
<p>(2) Paying Respect to Chairman Chiang: To Chairman Chiang of the National Government in Nanjing, the Communist bandits have raised arms and rebelled, destroying unity, and the red disaster is rampant, making the nation difficult. Fortunately, Your Excellency has been working diligently day and night, leading the suppression of the rebellion and the building of the nation, saving the people from fire and water, and rescuing the nation from danger. Your achievements are outstanding, and the people admire and respect you. As the inaugural National Assembly is successfully opened, with many talented people gathered, constitutional government is achieved, laying a solid foundation for democracy and completing the great success of the revolution, we send this telegram to express our respect and hope you will consider it.</p>
<p>(3) Comforting the Soldiers on the Front Lines: To the officers and soldiers on the front lines of the National Defense Department in Nanjing, the Communist bandits have conspired to betray the country, raising arms and rebelling, massacring the innocent, and wherever the red hooves go, the houses are ruined. Fortunately, our loyal soldiers are fighting bravely, shedding blood and fighting bitterly, seeing through the enemy's plans, and repeatedly suppressing the bandit's flames, preventing their conspiracies and vicious plans from succeeding. Now, the stubborn bandits are intensifying their efforts, selling out the motherland, intensifying their rebellion, and isolating themselves from the people. We firmly believe that justice will prevail over evil, and the removal of the red atmosphere is imminent, and the restoration of the mountains and rivers is just around the corner. We send this telegram to express our respect and hope you will consider it.</p>
<p>Cao Jun Explains the Significance of Youth Day</p>
<p>Subsequently, Cao Jun, Deputy Director of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, stating: "The current domestic situation, whether in politics, military affairs, or economy, is still in a difficult stage. We are not satisfied, and we must not deny it. However, we firmly believe that the darkest moment is before the dawn. We must pass through the eve of dawn with increased vigilance and patience. Today is Youth Day and the anniversary of the Huanghuagang martyrs. The creation of the Republic of China was the result of the blood and sacrifice of the Huanghuagang martyrs and countless patriots. When the martyrs dedicated themselves to the revolution, they were mostly young students. The succeeding youth groups, carrying on the spirit of the martyrs, from the Northern Expedition to the War of Resistance, served as the backbone of the vanguard fighters. The whole country was invigorated, and finally achieved the final victory. The government clearly designated today as 'Youth Day,' which has profound significance. However, since the victory, the organizational work of the youth has been somewhat insufficient, which has been exploited by Communist conspirators to use the youth to realize their ambitions. This has been confirmed in the recent Communist documents. We must address this point, strengthen the youth, and deal a fatal blow to the Communist conspiracy."</p>
<p>Qian Jianqiu Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Next, Qian Jianqiu, a representative of women, delivered a speech, elaborating on three points: (1) Today is the anniversary of the Huanghuagang martyrs. We must inherit and promote the revolutionary spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs. (2) The National Assembly is opened in Nanjing today. We must promote the Three Principles of the People with revolutionary spirit and work hard for constitutional government. (3) Today is also the Fifth Youth Day. We should awaken the youth, expose the Communist bandits' conspiracy to harm the country, and seek happiness for the people. She also reiterated the chairman's statement issued yesterday, clarifying that democratic politics is to seek the welfare of the majority of the people with the will of the majority of the people, which is in accordance with the principles of nature and the trend of the times. She believes that in the struggle between democracy and communism, democratic politics will defeat the Communist dictatorship politics that seeks the interests of the minority of the people with the will of the minority of the people, and achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>Student Representative Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Finally, the youth student representative delivered a speech, stating: "In the current situation, we must first seek national stability. Today, the government convened the National Assembly and started constitutional government, which is the beginning of national stability. I hope that the youth will strengthen unity, exert their greatest strength, assist the government, and work hard to promote constitutional government." The commemorative ceremony was completed at 11:30 a.m. amidst enthusiastic slogans, and the entertainment program of the China K.U.M. Society began immediately after that. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>

<h3 id="e84">New Invention in the Academic World, Electric Indexing Machine, Successfully Tested <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ge Zhaotong of the Research Department of National Chengchi University has been researching the use of indexing techniques for many years. Recently, he commissioned Mr. Zhang Zonghuang of the China Electric Company to manufacture an "Electromechanical Active Indexing Machine." It is temporarily powered by manual cranking. If the user wants to find the source of certain information (single characters are also acceptable) in a book, or to compile a word-by-word index of a book, they can first connect the wires and connect the "code plug" to the code disk of the desired character. Then, by cranking the shaft, the source of the desired information can be obtained on a piece of paper, and a word-by-word index of the book can be created. This machine is a preliminary model and has received considerable assistance from Mr. Zhong Jixiang. Further improvements are needed in the application. Currently, Mr. Ge is designing it to work with certain mechanisms so that all Western books can also be compiled into word-by-word indexes and any information can be obtained. From now on, manual index compilation can be brought to an end thanks to the invention of this machine. The difficulty in the Chinese saying "Where to start with the Twenty-Four Histories" is also solved. Zhang Xuecheng, a Qing Dynasty historian, advocated in his book "School Correction of Comprehensive Meaning" that "Chinese and foreign books should be classified and indexed." The ideal has now been realized. The use of active indexing is a convenient method for academic research, and it also makes a significant contribution to library science, lexicography, philology, history, and current affairs information. It is reported that Mr. Ge has been conducting simple experiments with the book "Great Learning" in recent days. The results are very satisfactory, and a public demonstration will be held in this city soon. It is reported that he has borrowed the Wu Liande Hall of the Asian Literary Society at No. 20 Huqiu Road and invited people from the academic press to visit and give guidance for improvement.</p>

<p>According to the person in charge of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on Jiangwan Road, the work of trying war criminals in various places is being ordered by the Ministry of National Defense to be completed as soon as possible. In the future, all war criminals who have been sentenced throughout the country will be gradually concentrated in the Jiangwan War Criminals Prison in this city for execution. The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals in Beiping has been ordered to end at the end of this month, and Kaifeng and other places have also ended this month. All unfinished cases will be transferred to the Military Tribunal in this city for trial. On April 5, a large batch of Japanese war criminals will be escorted to Shanghai for execution or trial, including many war criminals at the rank of general. Therefore, the work of the court will be tense again, but it is still determined to end before June of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Solving the Distress of Working Women: The Budding Daycare Undertaking, A Statistical Total of 26 Centers in the City, Faced With Financial Difficulties, Revenue Insufficient to Cover Expenses <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper] Miss XX received a high level of education and has talent. When she was in school, she repeatedly stated that she wanted to devote herself to society and serve the people. However, less than two years after she entered society, she gave up her career, extinguished her ideals, and buried her knowledge and talent in the family. It turned out that she had become a mother. There are too many examples like this among the relatives, friends, and colleagues we come into contact with. For most working women, the birth of a child after marriage is like the death knell of their career life, but unless they are willing to violate human nature and remain old maids for the rest of their lives, they cannot avoid this inevitable obstacle. This is truly the greatest sorrow and distress of working women.</p>
<p>In some countries in the world, this kind of distress has long been solved by the widespread establishment of daycare centers. But in China, the term daycare center is probably still unfamiliar to most people, and the daycare undertaking is just budding and taking root in an inconspicuous situation.</p>
<p>How Much Risk Do You Have to Take for the Health of Your Children?</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, there are currently 26 daycare centers in Shanghai, including 8 for working women, 5 for working women's employees, and 12 lactation rooms in factories. A total of more than 1,500 children are cared for, ranging in age from five months to six years. Most of these daycare centers only provide daytime care and are similar in nature to kindergartens. Only a few, such as the Professional Women's Daycare Center on Jiangxi Road, the YWCA Daycare Center on Weihai Road, the Shanghai Daycare Center on Jin Shenfu Road, and the Youyou Daycare Center on Disiwei Road, provide daycare around the clock.</p>
<p>"Running a daycare center is a thankless job. How much risk do you have to take for the health of your children? If you take good care of them, the parents will at most smile and say thank you. But if the children have a slight pain or itch, the parents will question the center and even launch a full-scale inquisition." This is Ms. Xu Jingzhi, the director of the Professional Women's Daycare Center, complaining to the reporter.</p>
<p>Tears at First, Then Laughter Through Tears</p>
<p>"Therefore," she said, "the center asks doctors to check the children three times a week, and nurses measure their temperature every day. If they have a slight fever, they will immediately notify their family or find a way to treat them. Some of the parents who send their children to the daycare center are working women, some are divorced couples, and some are parents of illegitimate children. When the children are first sent in, they inevitably cry and make noise. At this time, nannies and teachers need to guide them patiently. Some parents send their children to daycare centers out of necessity. At first, they are often reluctant to leave, and even shed tears. Later, when they see that their children are living not badly in the daycare center, they feel relieved and smile through their tears."</p>
<p>The Center That Houses the Most Children Has More Than 100 People</p>
<p>The Professional Women's Daycare Center is currently the daycare center that houses the most children, but there are only more than 100 people in total, divided into three groups. Children from five full months to one year old are placed in the infant nursery, children from one to four years old are placed in the toddler nursery, and children from four to six years old are placed in the kindergarten. Children in the infant nursery are artificially fed, and children in the kindergarten and toddler nursery eat two snacks and three meals a day. In addition to care, the kindergarten also provides kindergarten education. The children live together in a group, and their innocent activities and pure laughter become a source of comfort for the workers.</p>
<p>Currently, the biggest difficulties facing various daycare centers are insufficient funding and housing. Because working women have weak financial capacity and prices are rising daily, the revenue is not enough to cover the expenses. The government is unable to take care of them due to its own financial difficulties. Therefore, the existing daycare centers are only in their formative stages. It seems that the widespread establishment of large-scale daycare centers like those in other countries still needs to wait for quite some time to be realized.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Wife Plots to Seize Property, Mastermind Behind the Scenes: Wuxi Merchant Recounts Ordeal, Forcibly Imprisoned in Asylum, Factory Renamed and Occupied <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, a shocking case occurred in this city involving a merchant being forcibly confined in a mental hospital. The victim, a native of Wuxi, sought redress from the Wuxi Sojourners Association in Shanghai after regaining his freedom. Yesterday, the association hosted the press to appeal for justice and to hear the account of the ordeal from the "insane" person, who appears to be of sound mind. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yan Peixing, a 42-year-old Wuxi native, owns the Huaxing Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory in Shanghai. He married Yuan Bao Ying, 44 years old. The couple has been married for 18 years, and the relationship has been strained. Yan, being naturally weak, often suppresses his anger. In 1945, due to accumulated anger, Yan scribbled on a note, "If I were the emperor, I could kill my wife," a few words, which his wife subsequently obtained and kept. At the end of last year, Yan and his wife disagreed over their daughter's marriage. Since they have no sons, only two daughters, his wife intended to marry their eldest daughter to her nephew, which Yan opposed. As a result, their relationship became even more</p>
<p>Strained Beyond Repair</p>
<p>Around 10 a.m. on the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month last year (Little New Year's Eve), Yan was at the general distribution office of Yexing Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory on Henan North Road when five or six men in military uniforms, carrying weapons but without insignia, and plainclothes individuals barged in, claiming to take over the property. They forcibly pushed him out and locked the door. Unable to resist, Yan temporarily sought refuge at the Huaxing Yarn Tube Factory on Middle Zheng Road. Later that evening, around 10 p.m., concerned about the large quantity of goods (thirty or forty boxes of weaving shuttles of various sizes) stored in the Henan North Road distribution office, he went to check. He saw the interior</p>
<p>Brightly Lit</p>
<p>His wife, Yuan Bao Ying, and nephew, Yuan Xiangzheng, were inside, secretly moving goods. Upon hearing Yan's voice, they scattered and fled through the back door. The next day (New Year's Eve), around 4 p.m., while Yan was working upstairs in the general distribution office, the same five or six armed men in military uniforms suddenly broke in again. He distinctly heard his wife, Yuan Bao Ying, speaking downstairs. Shortly after, he was forced into a car and taken directly to Puji Hospital in Zhuanqiao, where he was forcibly admitted as a madman. After entering the hospital, according to Yan Peixing's recollection, the hospital did not conduct an examination but instead, the doctor, Wang, immediately injected</p>
<p>Anesthetic Doses</p>
<p>As many as eight times. Yan resisted, tearing his undershirt in the process. Later, he was shackled with handcuffs and confined to ward number four. Yesterday, Yan showed the torn undershirt and the marks of the shackles on his hands, claiming that according to the regulations of the mental hospital, the admission of a madman requires a certificate from the health bureau, but he had never been examined by the health bureau at all. Yan remained in the hospital for over a month, until recently when he managed to write a letter to his cousin and others to find a way to rescue him. His sister then reported the matter to the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, which dispatched personnel to the hospital on the 26th of this month to interrogate him, after which he was allowed to</p>
<p>Bail Him Out</p>
<p>Yan immediately went to Renji and Yihang hospitals for examinations, which proved that he had no mental abnormalities. Fearing being sent back to the asylum, he went to the Wuxi Sojourners Association in Shanghai for assistance and protection. At the same time, because his personal chops, documents, and account books had been taken away by his wife beforehand, and the Huaxing Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory, which he had founded with his life's blood, had been renamed Southeast Textile Hardware Manufacturing Factory, he has hired a lawyer to initiate legal proceedings. According to his relatives and members of the sojourners association, this matter appears to be motivated by his wife's desire for his property, but there is another mastermind behind the scenes.</p>
<h3 id="e90">National Refined Kerosene Industry争Competes for Diesel Fuel Supply: To Survive, Will Petition Again <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the war, the emerging national refined kerosene factories were once banned by the authorities. Later, after repeated petitions to various parties by the Oils and Fats Association, it was clarified that the existence of the national refined kerosene industry not only helps to supply fuel and depress prices but also saves foreign exchange, making it an industry necessary for people's livelihood and beneficial to the national economy. The authorities were then persuaded to allow them to continue operating, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs sympathized and agreed to support them, ordering the Management Committee to allocate diesel fuel. The Oils and Fats Association applied for allocation, and the association responded with two measures: (1) Each kerosene refinery should register according to the general factory registration method. (2) The scope of registration should be based on those who have registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, have obtained registration certificates, and are regularly operating. Each factory in the industry completed the registration procedures according to these two measures. However, the Transportation and Allocation Committee has consistently refused to allocate fuel, claiming that diesel imports are limited and that the allocation cannot be divided. The industry believes that other factories have coal as a fuel substitute, while kerosene refining cannot be done without diesel. If the authorities do not allocate it, national refined kerosene factories will not be able to survive. Yesterday, the person in charge of the industry association stated that all the competent authorities believe that diesel fuel should be allocated to the national refined kerosene industry, and even the Transportation and Allocation Committee has not denied it, but in reality, the allocation has not been approved. Now, for the sake of their own survival, the industry will petition the competent authorities again to fight for diesel allocation.</p>

It is also understood that in the future, all major essential materials for people's livelihood being transported to other cities near bandit-controlled areas must have adequate security, otherwise, they will absolutely not be allowed to be exported.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Hua Le Coal Mine Opens New Shaft and Resumes Production <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pei County, 25th Airmail] Among the coal mines near the battlefield, the Huadong Coal Mine in Jiawang has had a very fortunate experience. During the Japanese puppet era, although it was mined fiercely, almost to the point of exhausting its resources, it did not suffer any direct damage. On the contrary, it added equipment and housing. During the two years of the suppression of the rebellion, the bandits became professional coal mine destroyers. The Zhongxing Coal Mine in Yixian, not far from Jiawang, which usually had a daily output of 20,000 tons, has not yet resumed production after being destroyed. However, Jiawang was able to gradually restore production after being taken over and has not been destroyed by war even once. Now, it is still</p>
<p>Opening New Shafts</p>
<p>Planning for the long term. Amid the sound of destruction, it is a very exciting event.</p>
<p>The coal mine straddles the provinces of Jiangsu and Henan and is located in the area where the three counties of Tongshan (Jiangsu) and Tengyi (Shandong) interlock. So far, the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Shandong are still arguing over the ownership of the coal mine, for obvious reasons, they all regard it as a reliable source of tax revenue.</p>
<p>The history of the mine is not short. It was founded in 1898 by Hu Biwei of Jiangsu and named Jiawang Coal Mining Company. In 1927, it was renamed Shanghai Xiejie Company. In 1928, the property was transferred to Huadong Company, which was purely a commercial stock. The deposits in the Jiawang area were exhausted and abandoned, and the current Xiayang mining area is under the jurisdiction of Xiaqiao, Tengxian, Shandong. Before the War of Resistance, it already had a considerable scale. The total area of the mining area is 154,349 acres, the coalfield is widely distributed, and the reserves are estimated at more than 80 million tons according to drilling records. The basic equipment of the mine is complete, and there are also attached small flour mills, soap factories, tap water and electricity grids, etc. In terms of transfer equipment, there are more than 10 kilometers of light railways between Jiawang and Liuquan, which are used exclusively for coal transportation.</p>
<p>Looking at the Huadong Coal Mine from Jiawang Station, you can see rows of neat and small red buildings, which are the workers' housing and the relics of the Japanese occupation of the coal mine. To be fair, the Japanese made some construction efforts in the Suining area during the war. They once dreamed of developing the entire East China with Xuzhou as the core. Therefore, in Xuzhou, they opened wide roads and built more than 100 factories. In the areas surrounding Xuzhou, they also did some construction work. Taking Huadong Coal Mine as an example, the Japanese widened the light railway between Jiawang and Liuquan to connect with the Jinpu Railway. The above-ground buildings have also increased considerably. Two inclined shafts were also opened in the mine, but they were not completed because the victory came earlier than expected. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Japanese mined a total of more than 2.4 million tons of coal in Huadong Coal Mine. At the same time, because the mining was too fierce, it affected the guarantee period of the important underground roadways and shafts. Therefore, the coal left underground that cannot be mined in the future is estimated at more than 3 million tons. This is a debt that Japan owes to Huadong Coal Mine. Today, the coal mining company's request to allocate equipment from the Japanese compensation materials is very justified. The pre-war output of Huadong Coal Mine was about 1,500 tons per day. During the enemy puppet period, it once mined up to 2,000 tons per day, then automatically reduced it, with a minimum of only 30 to 50 tons per day, averaging about 300 tons. After the company was formally taken over, there was not a single kiln wood, and there was also a great lack of oil. Two years of</p>
<p>Rectification Efforts</p>
<p>Now there is a production of 2,000 tons per day. In addition to self-use, all of it is purchased by the Fuel Management Committee, mainly as fuel for the Jinpu and Longhai railways. In today's widespread coal shortage, the monthly supply of 60,000 tons also has its irreplaceable economic value. The coal mining company is currently actively carrying out the plan to open new shafts. The location of the new shaft is in Hanchang. It has now opened the second layer of coal. After testing, the coal quality is excellent. Driven by curiosity, the reporter walked several miles on the muddy wasteland to inspect the construction of the new shaft. The open space is full of mat sheds, and one side is piled with stones. I drilled into a mat shed and saw a new shaft being opened. The working machine is working 100 meters below the ground. Engineers and workers are lowered with a large hanging basket. Looking down with the naked eye, you can only see the dazzling electric light flickering in the cold and moisture. The engineer went down wearing a raincoat and boots and came out covered in water, as if he had been soaked in a heavy rain. This is truly arduous and down-to-earth 창工作. A person in charge of the company said: "The cost of opening a new shaft every day is already more than 2 billion yuan. If prices fluctuate in the future, it will definitely be more than this. If the situation changes slightly, everything may be in vain. So it is a risky investment." If there are no unexpected events, the new shaft can be officially produced by the end of this year. After that, the daily</p>
<p>Total Coal Production</p>
<p>In both the new and old areas will be around 5,000 tons. In today's difficulty of transporting coal from the north to the south, it is undoubtedly good news. According to the reporter's personal impression, the staff of Huadong Coal Mine are all capable and competent, and they also show a high degree of interest and enthusiasm for the work they are engaged in. They believe that the current difficulty in the coal mining industry is that the transportation cost is too high. For example, the cost of each ton of coal is about 2.4 million yuan when it leaves the mine. The freight from Jinpu Road to Pukou is 1.6 million yuan, and the total is more than 4 million yuan. The Fuel Management Committee purchases coal and stipulates that the delivery location is Pukou, and the freight is borne by the company. At present, the total cost of production and freight is about the same as the official price, and there is no legal profit. As far as kiln wood is concerned, it is said that the kiln wood obtained from Japan in exchange for goods is of poor quality and does not meet the requirements, so it is directly purchased from Jiangnan. The selling price of each kiln wood in the place of origin is not high, but because of its large volume and heavy weight, when it is transported to the mine after many turns, the cost of each kiln wood is more than 600,000.</p>
<p>The treatment of coal mines for workers is quite generous, and may be in the first place in the various places of Lushaodong Road. Their basic salary is very high, and the salary is calculated by discounting the average of the Shanghai workers' living index. It is said that they are one of the main forces among consumers in Xuzhou. The mine also provides coal for the family use of employees. In addition, there are hospitals, elementary schools for children, vocational schools for industrial and mining, and supply departments for employees. Due to the reasonable treatment and welfare system, the work efficiency is very high, and there are no large-scale labor disputes. In the pacification area close to the front, production depends on</p>
<p>Military Cover</p>
<p>To proceed. In particular, coal mines are regarded by the Communists as a major target for destruction. A cruel destruction may make it impossible to resume work for one or two years. Therefore, since last year, the central government has also regarded the protection of coal mines as an important task of the national army. In addition to its own three major mine police teams, Huadong Coal Mine also has national troops stationed in the mine to jointly undertake defense. The headquarters of the Third Pacification District is also in the coal mining company. The senior military officers of the headquarters attach great importance to the task of protecting the coal mine. One of them even said: "The importance of coal mine is better than 100,000 troops." In fact, due to their meticulous protection, the coal mine has never been destroyed by the Communists. In the past two or three years, due to the education of the actual environment, military personnel have generally improved their political and economic knowledge, which was not the case ten years ago. The coal mine has not failed those who protect it, because the latter also share their welfare measures. I heard in the Tenth Pacification District that the officers there envy the residential housing, water and electricity, and free schooling for children of the officers stationed in the mine.

<h3 id="e105">川康 Border Region: An Inspection Tour of Yi People in Chongqing <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 27th] The Sichuan-Kang Border Region Yi ethnic group inspection delegation arrived in Chongqing on the 24th, flying from Xichang. The delegation leader, Acting Commander Sun Fang, fell ill on the eve of flying to Nanjing after three months of social engagements. This influential figure in the Sichuan-Kang Border Region joined the army at the age of sixteen. In 1923, due to military merit, he was promoted to battalion commander in the Eighth Division of Chen Hongfan's Sichuan army, working alongside Liu Wenhui, the Chairman of Xikang Province. Therefore, in terms of seniority, he is the foremost among the Yi people. He has lived for fifty-five years and only ever been to Chengdu. He had long wanted to lead a group of important Yi figures on an inspection tour to the interior, but was hindered by communication barriers with the Han Chinese. Today, being able to accompany Yi affairs delegation leaders Luo Daying, Luo Zhenjiang, Guoji Mada, and others away from Xichang is truly a earth-shattering event in the eyes of the Yi people.</p>
<p>Last year, Guoji Mada was still the "Commander-in-Chief for Suppressing the Han" in the Puxiong Yi region, possessing eight thousand new-style rifles. Last year, a military plane flying from Xichang crashed over Haitangxi in Chongqing, and a major general-level section chief from the Xichang headquarters also perished. Yin Lidi (Han name: Li Shian), a national representative from the Sichuan-Kang border region who is proficient in Han Chinese affairs, joked to our reporter this evening at a banquet hosted by Chongqing notable Mr. Zheng Hongfu for the inspection delegation: "That plane was going to bomb Puxiong." Now, the Yi and Han in Puxiong are one family. Yi affairs delegation leader Guoji Mada repeatedly stated: He has decided to follow Commander He Guoguang's wishes and establish a administrative bureau. All of this must be attributed to the decades of effort by Acting Border Pacification Commander Sun Fang to promote Han-Yi relations.</p>
<p>Deng Xiuting, the Border Pacification Commander of Ningyuan Prefecture, passed away in June 1944. His family is the most esteemed in Ningyuan Prefecture today. He and Sun Fang once served together as regimental commanders in Yang Renan's Ningyuan Prefecture Qingxiang (Purification) General Command. After Yang stepped down, Deng reorganized it into the Border Pacification Command, with Sun serving as deputy commander and regimental commander. According to Yi customs, the Border Pacification Commander position is hereditary. His son, Deng Deliang, in his twenties, graduated from infantry school and is currently reporting for duty in Nanjing. The security of Yi affairs in the Sichuan-Kang Border Region is actually the responsibility of Acting Commander Sun Fang. "Eliminating the violent and pacifying the good" is the slogan promoted by Sun Fang. It is said that originally, the city gates of Xichang could not be opened casually. In Ningyuan Prefecture's nine counties, three bureaus, and twenty-six districts, Liu Wenhui only stationed one regiment. Without the nine Yi affairs regiments under Sun Fang's leadership (plus one regiment of regular army, including Han and Yi soldiers) to maintain local order, the border affairs would have been unimaginable.</p>
<p>The two Yi affairs regimental commanders, Luo Daying and Luo Zhenjiang, are always filled with reverence for Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang visited Xichang during the war, and Madam Chiang gave them silk handkerchiefs, which they have not yet used. They know that Chairman Chiang will definitely be elected president because "he is bigger than Liu Wenhui." Luo Zhenjiang also said: Bai Chongxi should also be vice president.</p>
<p>When our reporter told them that the *Shen Bao* had already published the photo of them with Director Zhu Shaoliang, Luo Daying replied: "Our Yi people don't have newspapers. There is a Luo Zhenghong in the inspection group who is very good at Yi language. There is a plane returning to Xichang tomorrow, and we have already asked him to write a long letter tonight to send out. The Han people's affection for the Yi people can surely be transmitted to the ears of millions of Yi people through this letter." (Our Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)</p>

<p>[Our Yuyao Dispatch, 28th] In recent days, the bandit gangs of Chen Buyi, Zhu Zhiguang, and Ding Youcan, who have been roaming within Yao and Ci, have been intensifying their disturbances. Since the night of the 25th, after Chen's bandits raided Lubu, the Second Battalion of the First General Regiment of Zhejiang Security Forces stationed at the Yuyao-Cixi border received the report and immediately dispatched the Fourth and Fifth Companies, together with the First Company stationed in Xiaolin Town, to encircle and suppress them in the mountains near Lubu. By the evening of the 26th, they had not returned to their posts. Chen's bandits believed there was an opportunity and attempted a large-scale encirclement of the Sixth Company stationed in Zhongcun. Therefore, at around 11 p.m. that night, they gathered about two hundred remnants of Zhu Zhiguang's bandits and adopted an encirclement formation towards Zhongcun, cutting off all telephone lines from Liangnong to Zhiling, and from Liangnong to Zhongcun, Shangyu, in the urban area, to prevent outside interference. Fortunately, the company had received prior warning. Company Commander Wu commanded all the soldiers to defend the bunkers and respond calmly. The two sides bombarded each other fiercely, with machine gun fire audible for dozens of miles around. From 1:30 a.m. until dawn at around 4 a.m. on the 27th, the bandits' ammunition was almost completely exhausted, and they suffered heavy casualties. They finally fled westward towards Yantou. When the bandits passed through Shangzhuang, they again seized more than thirty civilian laborers to carry the wounded bandits. According to reliable information, the bandits suffered heavy casualties in this battle, with more than thirty confirmed, including seven or eight dead. Five rifles were also captured. All of the damaged telephone lines were repaired by yesterday afternoon and are now functioning normally.</p>

<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 25th] The Jiangxi Provincial Government previously designated twenty-one counties in northern Jiangxi (Wuning, Xiushui, Pengze, Hukou, Jiujiang, Ruichang), western Jiangxi (Tonggu, Wanzai, Yichun, Fenyi, Yongxin, Ninggang), eastern Jiangxi (Shangrao, Guangfeng, Qianshan), and southern Jiangxi (Dingnan, Qiannan, Longnan, Xinfeng, Dayu, Chongyi) as martial law districts. Now, to adapt to the need for mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, it has added twelve more counties to the martial law list: Fuliang, Dexing in northern Jiangxi; Pingxiang, Shangchuan in western Jiangxi; Ganxian, Nankang, Shangyou, Anyuan, Xunwu in southern Jiangxi; and Guixi, Wangshan, Yiyang in eastern Jiangxi. Furthermore, the counties previously designated as pacification zones, namely Xiushui, Tonggu, Jiujiang, Ruichang, Wuning, Jingan, Yongxiu, Xingzi, and Dean, will have cases involving bandits and those obstructing transportation and destroying facilities handed over to the security commands of each zone for military trial.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Jin Bihui's Last Act: Dissolved Like "A Speck of Snow" <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 26th] The female spy Jin Bihui finally ended her life on the morning of March 25th at the First Prison of the Hebei Higher Court in Beiping. She had repeatedly requested a retrial and appealed, but to no avail. The final rejection ruling on her appeal was delivered to her at three o'clock on the morning of her death. Jin Bihui had sensed the signs of death a few days ago, and her conversations with people revealed a hopeless indifference. She was initially very confident that she would not die, but after learning that the Supreme Court had approved the death sentence, she knew that she would not survive.</p>
<p>Jin's residence was Room 3, Unit 1 of the Women's Prison in Yaojiajing First Prison. It is said that when she received the rejection ruling on her appeal from the guard at 3 a.m., she seemed to sense that the end of her life would be within hours. So she knocked on the wall, telling Li Ming, the traitorous actress next door, to tell Li Ming's young daughter not to cry when it got light, because she would be sleeping forever. Sure enough, at 5:30 a.m., the guard woke her up and told her to put her fingerprint on a document. Jin Bihui did not know that it was the execution at this time. Her hair was not combed, her face was not washed, and she put on her prison clothes and sleepily followed the guard out, walking through a small door that was not usually used. When she saw four bailiffs standing opposite her, she suddenly became aware of the danger and stood there in a daze, looking back desperately at Zhao Aizhen, the head of the women's prison who had treated her well, but Zhao uneasily avoided her gaze.</p>
<p>Four bailiffs firmly grabbed her arms and pushed her towards the open space in the southeast corner. At this time, the sky was slightly bright, and the east was a dim fish-belly color. Prosecutor He Chengbin sat behind the desk in the open space. The bailiffs pushed her in front of him:</p>
<p>"This prosecutor is here to carry out the order." Jin Bihui was still very smart and beautiful before her death. She no longer hesitated and asked for paper and pen to calmly write a will to her adoptive father Kawashima Naniwa and the warden, etc. Her hand did not tremble, and her face did not change color. After the will was written, the prosecutor asked Jin Bihui:</p>
<p>"Is there anything else to say?"</p>
<p>"No, please give this will to my father!" "I will definitely pass it on to him." Then he ordered the guards to bring two steamed buns and a bottle of wine, but she refused. The prosecutor ordered the bailiffs to push her to the execution. Without being tightly bound, and without excessive force, Jin Bihui turned to the west. After walking more than ten steps, she followed the bailiff's order to kneel down. With a "thud," the first shot misfired. The second shot went out and hit the back of Jin Bihui's head. The bullet went out from the bridge of her nose, and a stream of blood flowed onto her face. Her body trembled slightly and fell forward. This was at 6:40 a.m. on the 25th. The corpse was then moved by the bailiffs into a thin rectangular wooden box that had been used by many prisoners and carried out, stopping on the side of the main road outside the west gate. The people living nearby who heard the gunshot all rushed to surround and look at the corpse. An old lady said, "Every time this door opens, a dead body is carried out." Afterwards, the reporters were led to see the corpse and heard some of the words above. Someone who was related to Jin Bihui said, "The most regrettable thing is that they didn't even let her change clothes!" Jin Bihui was wearing a gray prison uniform, with a purple-red sweater and blue woolen pants underneath. The white cuffs that she used to wear were still visible on her sleeves, and the white socks and blue shoes were stained with dirt. Blood stains covered the upper half of her face, and her short hair was matted with clotted blood on the wooden board. Until noon, a Japanese monk, Tanigawa Daikyo, and Hirose from the Liaison Section, came in a large truck to collect the corpse. They wrapped Jin Bihui's belongings in three large packages and drove east with Jin's body at a little after three o'clock.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, according to Japanese funeral rites, Jin Bihui was finally cremated at the Eastern Suburban Cremation Ground left by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Jin Bihui's life finally ended like this. Jin Bihui truly was, as she herself said, "A speck of snow beside a raging fire!" This speck of snow has melted. (Our Reporter Song Shaobo)</p>

<p>(3) "The Dinner Table Front" in Chongqing</p>
<p>During portions of our wartime alliance with China, chronic tensions in Sino-American relations transformed the Chongqing dinner table into a curious propaganda front. On this front, Americans praised the Chinese Communists and criticised the Chinese Central Government. This situation reveals the grave errors of our wartime policies and the mentality behind them.</p>
<p>The root of this error lay in the failure of certain Americans to accept the slogan which the Communists themselves advocated, namely: "The Communist objective formerly was Chinese, but is now world revolution." In wartime and after the war, we needed to choose between the two: do we aid Communism, or support a government which emulates our own pure political and social ideals? Until recently, we remained undecided. But apart from this tragic irresolution, I am certain that our official wartime encouragement of the Chinese Communists placed an unnecessary pressure on the Central Government; it handily replaced American dealings with the Chongqing Government on the basis of mutual respect and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>This pressure takes the form of the formally recognised tactics of "intimidation, entreaty, admonition, and public uproar." These tactics have become the standard procedure of our dealings with the Chinese. This is unnecessary; this point was proven by General Wedemeyer, Stilwell's successor.</p>
<p>American aid to the Communists in Chongqing to increase pressure, is akin to playing with fire. The Central Government, however weak it appears to some American observers, still possesses sufficient power to resist such pressure. Until Wedemeyer's arrival, Sino-American relations deteriorated, and we should be thankful for this point.</p>
<p>In China's grim and devastated wartime capital, social life centered on banquets and cocktail parties. American officers turned them into lectures on the propaganda of the Yan'an Reds and criticisms of the Central Government.</p>
<p>Even among senior officers under Stilwell's command, there was little caution in these matters. The good impressions American observers received in Yan'an, however swiftly they disappeared, spread very widely. "The CCP are not true Communists, they are merely peasant reformers," became the talking point.</p>
<p>The Chongqing "dinner table front" became a center for hypocritical and absurd pronouncements, which deeply deceived the American public, of this I have no doubt. The influential tables in Chongqing became a "battlefield" of anti-Chiang and pro-Communist sentiment. On the other hand, the US military headquarters and press conferences were also the command and observation posts for this propaganda. The US military headquarters and the CCP headquarters both maintained close contact with the press conferences, or the press conferences maintained contact with them.</p>
<p>Although the Central Government and the US military authorities separately inspected the news telegrams sent out, primarily and secondarily respectively, it was difficult to prevent omissions or biases, and utterly impossible to prevent reporters from distorting the facts after they left. American censorship in Chongqing was limited to protecting American military secrets.</p>
<p>The American reporters stationed in Chongqing were the best audience for the beautiful depictions of the CCP and the dark tales of governmental corruption and incompetence.</p>
<p>Chinese and foreigners alike easily confided in Stilwell's subordinates, few of whom were governmental figures, but mostly CCP figures or those sympathetic to the CCP.</p>
<p>According to what personnel from the US military headquarters told my subordinates, this unbridled talk had been approved by Stilwell, allegedly as a means of pressuring the Chairman. I believe this is true, but if it is not, Stilwell's failure to prohibit this behavior is an equally great error.</p>
<p>This kind of talk in Chongqing greatly strengthened the CCP while weakening the government's position. At this time, an idea arose: in the KMT-CCP negotiations, it was primarily the government's side that needed to make concessions.</p>
<p>If there had truly been a chance to push the KMT and CCP to reconcile and prevent the CCP from getting involved in the currents of international Communism (I doubt such a chance ever existed), that chance was destroyed by the Americans' actions.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 26th] The anniversary of the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang is approaching. This reporter made a special trip to interview Mr. Wu Shi, a veteran soldier who participated in the uprising and is now retired, living by writing and calligraphy. Mr. Wu is old, but his speech is as vigorous as ever. According to him, among the martyrs, nineteen were from Fujian Province. Among them, those from Fuzhou included Lin Juemin, Lin Yinmin, Fang Shengdong, Lin Wen, Chen Gengxin, Liu Yuandong, Chen Kejun, Feng Chaoju, Liu Liufu, Chen Jusang, and ten others. But the actual number is more than that, and the martyrs should be eighty, of whom four were from Fujian, and their names were Guo Dawang, Guo Bofu, Guo Wenlian, and Guo Laohu. The reporter inquired about the current situation of the surviving soldiers, and the reply was: Fujianese Fang Junying (female), Zeng Xing (female), Guo Weiliang, Li Changshun, Liang Dong, Zheng Shengying, Li Hui, and Lin Sichen have all passed away. Those still alive are himself (70 years old), Zheng Lie (now working in the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court in the capital), Yan Ji (65 years old), Fang Yingtuan (68 years old), and Lin Youji (86 years old), all with gray hair and "clean sleeves." In the past, the families of the martyrs could receive an annual pension of nine hundred yuan, but now it is only issued at a value one thousand times that, so their lives are extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Buffalo Competition</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 25th] In order to encourage farmers to protect buffaloes and improve breeds, the Fujian Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Authorities specially held the 36th Annual Provincial Buffalo Competition on the 23rd of this month. More than two hundred units of farmers participated in this time, bringing a total of two hundred and twelve buffaloes. The location was the Fuzhou Public Stadium, and the time was scheduled for 9:00 AM, but because there were too many military positions, coming in an endless stream, so it was delayed until 4:00 PM that the competition was over.</p>
<p>More than two hundred guests participated in the evaluation, including many foreign guests and animal husbandry experts. After four hours of careful evaluation, everyone gave the corresponding scores from each bull's horns, hooves, eyes, sound, nostrils, teeth, ears, tail, udder, anus, and various departments. Among them, in the bull group, Guo Chunren won the award, and in the cow group, Lin Minkang won the award. The prizes they received were also very novel, and each person received a calf.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Spring's Bustle by West Lake <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou office, 29th] "The lake sparkles, radiant when the sky is clear, the mountain's hue, misty and strange when it rains; If West Lake is compared to Xizi, she is lovely whether lightly adorned or heavily made up." These are Su Dongpo's lines praising West Lake. Since the beginning of spring this year, it can be said that West Lake has been lightly adorned more often than heavily made up. On March 14th, Mr. Pan Gongzhan and female artist Tang Guanyu came to Hangzhou together, intending to spend a week in Hangzhou. However, they encountered continuous spring rain. Mr. Pan and Ms. Tang were undeterred in their enthusiasm for sightseeing. On the first day, they toured Beishan with the reporter. On the second day, the reporter had to go to Gan, so the two of them enjoyed a leisurely tour on the lake in the rain. They returned to Shanghai on the third day, leaving a message for me, promising to come again after Qingming.</p>
<p>Tang Guanyu Paints Peach Blossoms, Pan Gongzhan Inscribes a Poem</p>
<p>After touring Beishan that evening, the three of us dined at Lou Wai Lou restaurant. The waiters at this restaurant all recognized Mr. Pan and Ms. Tang. They brought out a book of inscriptions by famous people, hoping that they would leave some more of their art. Ms. Tang's inspiration surged. Perhaps she was moved by seeing the peach blossoms on the shores of West Lake for the first time in three years after the victory. She casually created a painting of ink peach blossoms, adding a few strokes of willow branches beside the peach blossoms. The painting was exceptionally precise and steady. The reporter loves painting and had never seen anyone use light ink to paint peach blossoms. Peach blossoms are usually vibrant, and it is often more difficult to make light ink pleasing than using colors. However, Ms. Tang's painting was just like West Lake on a rainy day. Although lightly sketched, it did not lose the fresh beauty of spring peach blossoms. Mr. Pan inscribed a poem on the painting: "The peach and willow trees on the embankment compete in fragrance, the misty rain fills the lake with green hues. Do not sigh at returning after the disaster, for today the earth is once again filled with spring." It can be said that he perfectly captured the scene and emotions.</p>
<p>Book a Room for One Day, Pay the Price of Three</p>
<p>In the past few days, West Lake has been experiencing continuous rain again, but tourists are not deterred from sightseeing. On the 28th, the West Lake train from Shanghai to Hangzhou was increased to as many as ten carriages. The hotels were already fully booked, and some rooms were booked until the 20th of next month. It is said that one hotel even demanded a fee before a room could be booked. Their reason was that in order to reserve the room for you, they could not sell it to other guests the day before, and they could not sell it to other guests the day after. Therefore, if you book a room for one day, you have to pay the price of three days. All the corridors of the hotels and any available space were utilized. A straw mat could be rented for 30,000 yuan per night, a quilt for 80,000 yuan per night, and a pillow for 20,000 yuan per night. The temporary business was very prosperous. Recently, tourists have also had wild ideas, and bathhouses, restaurants, and eateries have all been turned into temporary dormitories. There are even many people playing cards all night in cafes. Wealthy people rent a car to use as transportation during the day and as a temporary dormitory at night. It is a pity that the weather is not cooperating; otherwise, rickshaws, handcarts, and boats would also be good dormitories?</p>
<p>Fish is 4 Million, Braised Pork Only 10 Pieces</p>
<p>The business of hotels and restaurants is, of course, particularly good, and Lou Wai Lou and Tai He Yuan are even better. Rooms that were reserved a couple of days ago were temporarily occupied by other guests. The owners exclaimed, "Good business is not good." The people who originally reserved the rooms came and saw the owners' "crying" faces and the situation of these guests who were usurping the place and making a commotion. Everyone came to enjoy the spring, and everyone was helpless. Therefore, they had to negotiate with these usurpers: "Can you let us have it after you've finished eating?" As for the dishes in the restaurants? A shark fin banquet costing 4 million yuan had nothing to eat except for a few pieces of shark fin as garnish. Even the famous West Lake Fish in Sweet and Sour Sauce was missing. A portion of braised pork in the cold dish only had ten pieces. If there were twelve guests, you would have to be forgiven. A shop specializing in set meals was also doing very well, but this type of customer is not welcome in famous restaurants. A customer went to a noodle shop and ordered a bowl of Guo Qiao noodles, which cost 200,000 yuan. The customer was shocked and said, "It only costs 120,000 yuan in Shanghai. How can it be so expensive?" The waiter said, "Sir, just pay it! This is the cheapest!" The Hangzhou Municipal Government mobilized cadres every day to be stationed in various restaurants, three or four in each, to prevent people from escaping the banquet tax.</p>
<p>Taxi from the Train Station to the Lake Demands 200,000</p>
<p>Usually, the taxi companies in Hangzhou wait for customers at the train station every day, and many empty cars return. Now it is very different. Every day, a large number of taxis drive from the train station to the lakeside. The reporter saw this scene in Shanghai just after the victory. Rickshaws, sedan chairs, and tricycles are, of course, charging exorbitant prices. From the train station to the lakeside, which originally only cost 30,000 yuan, they now also speak Shanghainese and ask newly arrived guests for as much as 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>West Lake boat rentals are even more outrageous. Not long ago, they were set at 450,000 yuan per day. On the 27th, they were set at 600,000 yuan per day. A boat rental costs 3 million yuan per day, and someone offered 2 million yuan. "I won't rent it to you for a penny less." Is Hangzhou really "relying on one spring for three winters?" Is that why they are so unscrupulous in demanding money from guests? And there are so many guests who are willing to pay. The reporter has repeatedly pointed out the reason in the past. Because everyone feels depressed, everyone feels uncertain about the future, so it is better to "enjoy today's wine today." However, this is very different from the ancients' enjoyment of mountains and rivers, and from the intentions of Mr. Pan and Ms. Tang to purify their minds and cultivate their nature through this.</p>
<p>The Crazy Psychology Should Be Corrected</p>
<p>We who live in Hangzhou, especially the reporter, who is a nervous person, feel that both this crazy demand for money and those reckless tourists are committing the same psychological mistake. Today, our realistic environment is not good. This is, of course, an undeniable fact. Everyone is depressed, but we must always find ways to break through the depression. The scenery of Hangzhou is good, but enjoying the mountains and rivers is not just about spending money to have a good time. To enjoy the mountains and rivers, you need to be with two or three close friends, talking and playing, avoiding worldly concerns, and creating a peaceful environment. Only with close friends can you find a way to break through the depression in this serenity. Only then will you feel the loveliness and beauty of the lakes and mountains. Bai Juyi, who contributed to the development of West Lake, had no desire to chant poetry after leaving. He had a poem: "Since leaving the mountains and waters of Qiantang, I have not drunk much wine or chanted poetry. I want to convey this feeling by returning on a boat, to tell the wind and moon of West Lake." Now, more than tens of millions of people have visited Hangzhou, and more than tens of millions of people rely on the spring tourism in Hangzhou for a living. I wonder, after the excitement is over, will they have the same feelings as Mr. Bai Juyi? (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3 id="e115">Wang Maogong Explains the Content of Total War <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang office, 28th] Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang Maogong, at a press conference on the 27th, reported that the Central China Pacification Zone's total war meeting made the following nine important decisions: (1) The commander of the Pacification Zone concurrently serves as the administrative director and expands the organization of the Pacification Zone headquarters and the administrative office. The administrative departments will add civil affairs and economic affairs departments. The commander has the power to uniformly command military, political, economic, party affairs, and people's organizations within the jurisdiction. (2) The Pacification Zone establishes a policy of security, self-defense, and self-sufficiency. The commander will thoroughly control all personnel, food, and materials within the jurisdiction, and implement on-the-spot replenishment and supply methods. (3) The provincial security teams and local self-defense forces within the Pacification Zone will be trained, supervised, and utilized by the commander. (4) The commander of the Pacification Zone has the power to assess, reward, punish, and remove civil and military officials within the jurisdiction in advance. (5) All personnel sent by higher-level agencies to the Pacification Zone are subject to the supervision and management of the commander of the Pacification Zone. (6) The food supply in the Pacification Zone is supervised, managed, and registered by the commander. All surplus grain is either concentrated and stored or purchased at a price under the commander's control to enrich military supplies and civilian food. Important military materials are also strictly controlled by the commander, purchased at a price, or requisitioned, and a comprehensive economic blockade is implemented against the bandit areas. (7) Security fortresses are established in the Pacification Zone to concentrate military forces, concentrate able-bodied men, and concentrate food and materials, which are planned and utilized by the commander. (8) The replenishment of personnel in the Pacification Zone is determined by the commander, who allocates local recruitment in counties and cities. The commander also uniformly trains local forces in the jurisdiction and registers and utilizes local civilian firearms. (9) The land policy of the Pacification Zone decides to implement equal land use rights to achieve equal land rights, stipulating the maximum amount of land ownership and issuing land bonds to grant land to soldiers and enable farmers to obtain land, while vigorously implementing the 30% rent reduction policy. All of the above measures are the full responsibility of the commander of the Pacification Zone, which can eliminate all previous uncoordinated problems and maximize the combat power for suppressing bandits. At the same time, an economic blockade against the bandits will cut off their resource supply, giving the bandits a fatal blow. It can also make our military and civilian needs more abundant. The commander will effectively control the replenishment of personnel in the Pacification Zone, preventing the bandits from coercing people, so as to complete the suppression of the rebellion as soon as possible and stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>[Report from our Bengbu office, 27th] The number of disaster victims gathered in Bengbu City is close to 10,000. The local government has set up three porridge kitchens to provide relief, but there are still many who are not served. Recently, more refugees have been sent from Nanjing. A total of five batches, totaling about 2,000 people, have arrived in Bengbu. The municipal government sent personnel to distribute resettlement expenses, 100,000 yuan per person. However, there are many refugees, and those gathered near the train station have been starving for days. In their desperation, they snatched food and grain on the eastern section of the main road near the station and west of the overpass on the 26th and 27th, causing disturbances. Several rice shops closed early and stopped operating because they were robbed. Upon receiving the report, the local party, government, military, police, and constitutional leaders convened an emergency meeting at the municipal government at 11:00 a.m. today (the 27th) to discuss how to handle the refugees passing through. The following resolutions were made: (1) In addition to the refugees already arriving and receiving food at the porridge kitchens every day, each refugee concentrated outside the West Gang will be given three kilograms of rice. (2) Refugees arriving in Bengbu will be concentrated outside the East Gang and given 100,000 yuan for returning home, as well as three kilograms of rice. (3) The elderly and weak refugees who cannot return home and are stranded in Bengbu will be accommodated as much as possible and provided with rice porridge, up to a maximum of 2,000 people. It is also learned that the local military and police have severely curbed the refugees' food snatching to maintain public order.</p>

<p>[Report from our Jiangdu office, 29th] The Liuwei ferry terminal, a vital transportation route in Zhenjiang, has repeatedly suffered levee collapses, making it a daunting journey for travelers. After the Suzhou government planned to rebuild it, it was moved to Jiaga Port. When construction began, local residents did not understand the government's good intentions to protect the safety of passengers and gathered to sound gongs to prevent it. The county government convened the local village chiefs to discuss remedial measures, deciding to minimize farmland losses as much as possible, designating public land, building houses to provide resettlement for the affected residents. The dockworkers will be recruited from the affected residents, and schools will be established, all of which will be used as farms, giving priority to providing relief with agricultural products.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Taiwan Delegation Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing to Visit; Began Visiting Primary and Secondary Schools Yesterday; Expected to Leave Shanghai for Hangzhou in Three Days <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our office] The Taiwan education workers' mainland education visiting delegation arrived in Shanghai by military plane on the evening of the 28th. They arrived at the North Station at 7:50 a.m. yesterday. Those who went to welcome them included Mr. Zhu Junti, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Section Chief Liu Xunmu, and Section Chief Lu Guanliu. The visiting delegation has a total of 16 members, led by Education Director Xu Keqi of Taiwan Province, and accompanied by Ministry of Education Secretary Fang Zhimou, Section Chief Xue Tianhan, and Zhang Zhenyu. After leaving the station, they took a special car waiting from the municipal government and drove directly to the Jinmen Hotel, where they stayed. After having breakfast at the West YMCA, they set off by car at 9:30 a.m. to visit. They first went to the Provincial Shanghai High School, where Principal Shen Yizhen accompanied them to visit the school's dormitory, classrooms, sports field, and dining hall. They then went to the Provincial Shanghai Experimental School to visit the unit design teaching. The units set by the school this week are "Taiwan Research" for the middle and senior grades, "Commemorating the Martyrs of Huanghuagang" for the lower grades, and "Flying Kites" for the kindergarten. Director Xu Keqi and others praised it highly after the visit. The school treated the guests with honey produced by its bee farm. Children's representatives of the school entrusted Director Xu to take a letter from Jiangsu children to Taiwan children, and asked him to sign it as a memento. At noon, the principals of the city's central national schools hosted a lunch at the Youth Hall. In the afternoon, they continued to visit the Municipal Xinsheng National School and the library of the China Book Company on Macau Road.</p>
<p>Seven Bookstores Host</p>
<p>In the evening, the city's seven major bookstores, including Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, China, World, Datong, Kaiming, and Children's, held a joint welcome banquet at the Youth Association, attended by Xu Keqi, director of the Taiwan Education Department and leader of the delegation, and delegation members Hu Bingshen, Ke Chaozhou, Huang Maoxing, Zhang Fangjie, and others. Ministry of Education Secretary Fang Zhimou, Section Chiefs Zhang Zhenyu and Xue Tianhan, Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Secondary Education Director Xie Engao, National Education Director Zhu Junti, Section Chiefs Lu Guanliu and Yan Chunshan also attended. During the banquet, bookstore representatives Li Shizeng, Li Bojia, Jiang Zhicheng, and Zhang Yiqu successively delivered welcome speeches. Ministry of Education Xue Tianhan and Education Bureau Zhu Junti gave speeches, expressing their concern and admiration for the publishing industry's active promotion of culture in Taiwan Province. Director Xu Keqi and others gave reply speeches, which were very sincere, hoping that the publishing industry would continue to provide spiritual food to Taiwan Province to alleviate the book famine. A Western-style dinner was enjoyed by the guests and hosts, and it lasted until 9:00 p.m. After the meal, the Education Bureau hosted a visit to the Majestic Theater to watch a movie.</p>
<p>Today's Itinerary</p>
<p>The visiting delegation is scheduled to stay in the mainland for a total of 20 days. After staying in Shanghai for three days, they will go to Hangzhou on April 1st to visit for several days, and then travel to Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places for visits. Today's itinerary for the visiting delegation in Shanghai is: 9:00 a.m., visit District 10, Center 1 (Xinzha Road Primary School); 10:00 a.m., visit the Municipal Women's Normal Affiliated Primary School and Kindergarten; 11:30 a.m., visit Mayor Wu at the City Hall, and lunch will be hosted by the mayor at the official residence.

Dinner will be hosted by the principals of the municipal secondary and higher schools at the First Girls' High School, and the municipal government will host a visit to the China Grand Theater to watch Ma Lianliang's Peking opera.</p>
<p>Purpose of Visiting the Mainland</p>
<p>The delegation spent five days in Nanjing, visiting major primary and secondary schools, social welfare, and relief agencies. According to Director Xu Keqi, leader of the delegation, the delegation members were very impressed. They participated in two symposiums in Nanjing, one hosted by the Ministry of Education and one hosted by the Nanjing education community. The Ministry of Education reported in detail on the education policies, guidelines, and implementation. During the meeting, delegation members repeatedly asked questions in Mandarin. The purpose of the delegation's visit to the mainland this time is not to make comparisons in terms of material things, but purely to observe and learn, in order to absorb the culture of the motherland, learn the spirit of the motherland, and promote cultural exchange. Seeing is believing. The delegation members were deeply excited to see that the motherland, after eight years of resistance, is now in a time of suppressing the rebellion, and manpower and material resources are extremely difficult, but educational facilities are still being implemented according to established steps, and new plans and research are constantly being carried out. They are very willing to bring the great situation of the motherland and the happy emotions gained from the visit back to Taiwan to tell every fellow compatriot in Taiwan Province.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Education in Taiwan Province</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation of education in Taiwan Province, according to Director Xu, in the past, Mandarin instruction had to be translated, but now, teachers in all primary and secondary schools are teaching in Mandarin. According to recent statistics, in addition to Taiwan University, there are three independent colleges above the junior college level: the Normal College in Taipei, the Engineering College in Tainan, and the Agricultural College in Taichung, with a total of 1,399 students. There are 123 secondary schools, 8 teacher training schools, and 74 vocational schools, including 35 agricultural science schools, 13 engineering schools, 17 business schools, 2 maritime schools, 1 medical school, and 5 home economics schools, with a total of 86,000 students. There are a total of 1,070,000 school-age children in Taiwan Province, and currently there are 846,000 primary school students, with more than 80% of school-age children attending school. In the future, efforts should be made to cultivate teachers and improve the quality of teachers.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Accusing Someone of Corruption, Demanding Entertainment Expenses; Two Middle School Students in Beiping Become Protagonists in Fraud Case <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 29th] A bizarre fraud case recently occurred in Beiping. The victim was Beiping City Councilor Zhang Yangtian, and the perpetrators were Wang Jiye and Liu Peiyuan, students of Huibing Middle School. Because they could not afford tuition fees, they came up with a strange idea and took this extreme measure, which is a tragic reflection of the dire situation of education. On the 14th, Zhang Yangtian suddenly received a strange letter, which stated: Zhang's real estate from matchmakers and kilns came from unclear sources. At a time when corruption is being severely investigated, if the director is informed, people will be separated from their wealth, and the disaster will extend to nine generations. If 400 million yuan is paid as entertainment expenses, everything will be safe in the future. A reply was required within two days, signed by the section chief of the Office of the Ministry of National Defense. On the 23rd, another letter was received stating that the required entertainment expenses must be at least 200 million yuan. A check could be made payable to Wang Shujin, No. 1 Chuanban Hutong, for transfer. On the same day, a phone call was received urging Zhang to pay. Zhang immediately wrote two checks for 50 million yuan and sent them, and reported the case to the police. At 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, two students went to Derunxing Bank to cash the checks. The police immediately captured the two and identified them as Wang Jiye and Liu Peiyuan, both top students from the famous Huibing Middle School in Beiping. Wang was the mastermind, Wang Shujin was his alias, and the motive for the fraud was to pay tuition fees. As for the family situation of the defrauded Zhang Yangtian, it was heard from relatives.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Teacher Education After the Implementation of the Constitution <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>—Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>—Written for the 37th Teacher Education Movement Week</p>
<p>In the difficult task of nation-building, teacher education undoubtedly occupies a crucial position. However, precisely because its position is so crucial, its value is not easily understood and is sometimes underestimated. Of course, at present, there is an urgent need to cultivate specialized talents in the fields of industry, agriculture, military, and government to share the heavy responsibility of nation-building. In this context, teacher education may seem to have a weak and slow function. However, looking around the country, illiteracy accounts for half the population, and the words and actions of educated youth tend toward extremism or decadence. At this time, as the period of political tutelage ends and the implementation of the constitution begins, we are entering the path of democracy. The foundation of democratic politics is local autonomy, and the popularization of national education is the root of implementing local autonomy. Otherwise, how can we achieve national unity of purpose? And how can we cultivate nation-building talents on this desolate ground? Therefore, this heavy responsibility naturally falls on the shoulders of teacher education. I believe that future teacher education should progress from naturalism to idealism and culture, and from individualism to nationalism and the nation.</p>
<p>Academic Research and Professional Training</p>
<p>Teacher education has naturally become a specialized training because education has now become a specialized discipline. Whether in the elucidation of theories, the formulation of curricula, or the research of teaching methods, there has been considerable progress. Thanks to the progress of academic research, teacher education has also progressed. At the same time, because of the rich practical experience of teacher education, academic research has also accelerated its progress. The two are mutually beneficial and inseparable. Therefore, American schools such as Harvard and Stanford have two types of degrees for education disciplines: one is a liberal arts degree, and the other is an education degree. The former is research-oriented, while the latter is professionally oriented. However, I believe that future teacher education in our country should not only aim to promote the education discipline but also make further demands.</p>
<p>Indigenous Culture and National Life</p>
<p>We all know that the composition of society is not just a material arrangement of nature and people. The continuation of society depends heavily on the transmission of experience. Culture is the continuation of social experience. And the effectiveness of our teacher education lies in the teacher trainees who are responsible for transmitting culture in the middle, and then further seeking its development and making it great. We have five thousand years of brilliant culture, but as Sun Yat-sen has shown, we have lost confidence and vitality in the constant difficulties of internal and external troubles. In the future, the responsibility of teacher education lies in deeply excavating the source of our national life, cultivating it, and enabling it to gain new life. We are now greedily admiring foreign cultures, but there has never been a country in the world that can survive by ignoring its own history and inherent culture. Future teacher trainees must understand, appreciate, and grasp the essence of our culture, and use it to influence and nurture the people of the country. Therefore, I say that the professional training of teachers is not only about the development of teaching skills; the promotion of national education is not only about the transmission of knowledge and skills. Education will not be produced without culture. The highest meaning of education is a cultural act. Teacher education should focus on promoting indigenous culture, and teacher trainees should undergo long-term cultivation of indigenous culture. In this way, our country's future education can progress from being natural and utilitarian to being cultural and spiritual.</p>
<p>Liberating from Superficial Utilitarianism</p>
<p>Furthermore, the culture of a country is the spirit of its founding, the soul of the nation. Teacher education is the foundation of national education, and the spirit of a country's founding is entrusted to national education. Looking at the history of countries both at home and abroad, countries that have revived from danger and destruction have almost all done so by vigorously implementing national education and strictly training teachers. I believe that future teacher education should be liberated from narrow individualism and superficial utilitarianism. Education is essentially an interaction in which people form and combine with each other. Everything special and individual only has meaning when it belongs to the general and the whole. A nation, a country, has its common history and common ideals. We must make every citizen live under the same belief and ideal, creating a great "like-mindedness," creating a complete, organic, and interdependent country. Because individuals can only survive by belonging to the state and being subordinate to the nation. This does not mean negating the value of the individual; we firmly believe that only by transcending the individual can the individual develop. I think that we, who have experienced eight years of arduous war and are still suffering from internal strife, should be able to appreciate the significance of teacher education that prioritizes the country and the nation. The people of the whole country should live and progress under the same Three Principles of the People's belief, and those who shoulder this heavy responsibility are the future teacher education. It must create the same belief and the same ideal based on our country's history and inherent culture, and promote it so that the people of the whole country live in such an atmosphere. Therefore, I say that future teacher education in our country should progress from individualism to the nation and the country.</p>
<p>Devoutly Promoting the Ideal of Teacher's Ethics</p>
<p>Moreover, according to our country's history, the position of teachers has always been particularly high. The responsibility of teachers lies in imparting the Way, not just transmitting words. The so-called Way, from the current point of view, is the inherent belief and ideal of a country. The so-called respect for the teacher and the Way is to say that only when the teacher can devoutly promote this ideal can he make it flourish.</p>
<p>I think that if future teacher education can follow this path and promote it, the foundation of constitutional government can be firmly laid, and our country's century-long plan will not be shaken.</p>

<p>Referee He Chunhui. The two teams deployed their formations, and Tede attacked first. Qingbaiqing strengthened its defense and did not make any mistakes. Gao Xiuqing and Fei Chunhua tried to shoot twice, but Xu Fusheng rescued them from danger. Tede attacked again, but Meng Yiliang's defense was effective, preserving the situation.

Before long, the first half ended, with Qingbaiqing leading 4-1.</p>
<p>Second Half: 3-1</p>
<p>After the break, the lineups of both sides changed slightly. Qingbaiqing took advantage of the remaining courage and launched a fierce attack on Tede's position. Tede tried to stop them. After about five minutes, Jin Lusheng got the ball and advanced quickly. Edward was unable to save it in time, and Xiao Alu broke the net from the left corner, 5-1. Tede reorganized its army and counterattacked, but Qingbai's defense was tight and they could not go deep. In the eighth minute, Luo Shoufu attacked Huanglong alone, 6-1. In the fourteenth minute, Xu Erz dribbled the ball deep, and Wu Qixiang caused trouble in the penalty area. Robert Stoff took the penalty, but it was too high, and Xu Heng jumped up and patted it out. After another ten minutes, Xiao Fei broke in, and Edward pulled up a foot, Xiao Fei's left leg was injured and he fell to the ground, a penalty was awarded, and Yan Shixin gently dialed it over the field, and nothing was gained. At 35 minutes, Tede Liu Zhiguang sent it to Cao Qinfang to shoot, Xu Heng was caught off guard, and the gate was trapped, making it 6-2. Six minutes later, Gao Xiuqing revisited the old place, and a fierce attack from 20 yards away succeeded again, and another contribution was made. Time was up, Qingbaiqing defeated Tede 7-2.</p>

<p>The first battle between the US Navy and Dagong ended in a 59-59 tie, and the extended time resulted in a defeat by a difference of four points, which proves the ferocity and skill of the team.

<h3 id="e146">In Happy Valley, a Goal Lost: Sing Tao Defeats Eastern to Retain Special Silver Shield Soccer Championship <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>A Pair of Penalty Kicks Decide the Victory</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The Silver Shield championship was fiercely contested on the 21st at Happy Valley. The Group A match pitted Sing Tao against Eastern, while the Group B match featured South China against the Navy. We watched these two matches with absolute delight. In the first match, South China lived up to expectations, defeating last year's champion, which was truly gratifying. In the second match, Eastern, undeterred by the strong opponent, relentlessly pressured Sing Tao, providing the audience with a tense game. It was truly a coincidence that both of these tense matches were decided by a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>Eastern Lost to the Referee</p>
<p>In all fairness, Eastern played exceptionally well, so their loss can be attributed to the referee. The first penalty kick awarded by Referee Yang Ge was baffling even to Sing Tao themselves. The penalty was called when Tsang Sek-hong and Chu Wing-keung jumped to compete for the ball, and Sek-hong was deemed to have slightly touched "Little Chu." Objectively speaking, in such an important match, with only two minutes elapsed and the nature of the foul so subtle, it seemed inappropriate to award a penalty.</p>
<p>Eastern was successful, holding 60% of the offensive throughout the match. If Wai Lam and Chi-fen had performed better, and Tak-kei had provided good support, the situation would have been entirely different. I pointed out earlier that Eastern's ball acquisition relied solely on Fuk-chuen's long passes and Tak-kei's quick shots, but Sing Tao is not an ordinary team, so it was difficult to find opportunities.</p>
<p>However, Eastern's central defensive line had unexpected strengths, controlling almost the entire midfield with an advantage. Tsang Sek-hong was excellent with both his head and feet, maintaining his form from start to finish, which was commendable. Kwan-kan also gave a steady performance, saving Chiu-wing's second penalty kick with a beautiful posture. With such a performance from the entire team, losing the championship due to a single penalty kick was truly undeserved.</p>
<p>Sing Tao Completely Out of Form</p>
<p>Indeed, Sing Tao played completely out of form. The forward line was adjusted left and right but failed to achieve good results. Chu Wing-keung initially played as the center forward but was completely contained by Hansen. In the second half, he played in Kam-ho's position, with Ying-fan filling in as the center forward and Kam-ho on the right wing, but there were still no good attacks.</p>
<p>The midfield line, which is usually full of vitality, had Ling-sing standing behind to keep a close eye on "Jach-lui," and the two midfielders also had to pay attention to defense. As a result, their ability to assist in attacks was insufficient. Sing Tao's victory was somewhat fortunate. From a performance perspective, they were unable to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>First Half Penalty Kick</p>
<p>Kick-off: Sing Tao adopted their usual tactics, launching an attack from the start. Ying-fan penetrated from the right side and crossed the ball into the center. Wing-keung was about to jump for a header when Sek-hong intercepted, and in the ensuing chaos, a penalty kick was awarded. Chiu-wing successfully converted the penalty, making it 1-0. This happened just two minutes after the kick-off. After this, Eastern desperately pressed forward. Chi-fen's shot was saved, and Wing-kwong missed two chances to score. In the 19th minute, Wai-lam passed to Fuk-chuen, creating a good opportunity. Fuk-chuen took a shot from 20 yards out, but it went wide. Then, Sek-hong took a free kick, and Tak-kei headed the ball high, resulting in many attacks but no success.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, Wai-lam was injured by King-shing. When he returned to the field, Eastern's defense was in trouble. Wing-keung charged forward alone, and Sek-hong's "flying tackle" resulted in another penalty kick. This time, Chiu-wing took the shot, but Kwan-kan saved it. The first half ended with a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>No Score in the Second Half</p>
<p>Second Half: Eastern continued their relentless attack. Tak-kei dribbled forward and passed diagonally to Wai-lam, but "Dee-bo" slipped in front of the goal. Wai-lam got the ball and passed it to the corner of the goal, but Leung Wing-kwong lacked experience and failed to reach it. Once, Wing-kwong had an opportunity, but Yiu-tak missed the ball. If Wing-kwong had passed the ball to the center, there would have been a sure chance, but he shot the ball high. Here, the Tiger team only had one good shooting opportunity, when Wing-keung got the chance to shoot at the goal, and Fung King-cheung rushed forward to touch it, but Tak-bo intercepted it. In the ensuing melee, neither team could score another goal, and Eastern had to suffer defeat in Happy Valley, losing 1-0 to Sing Tao.</p>

<h3 id="e147">National and Private Textile Industry Representatives Suggest Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Committee to Establish Three Groups for Raw Materials, Export, and Domestic Sales <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Representatives of the national and private textile industries in this city, recognizing the numerous difficulties in implementing the cotton yarn and cloth management methods, have comprehensively revised them. They have discussed a comprehensive plan with relevant parties, which National Bank President Chang Chia-ngau submitted to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions in Beijing. The plan proposes that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Bank, the National Textile Federation, the Textile Construction Company, and the Cotton Spinning Guilds of the six regions appoint representatives. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will organize a "Joint Cotton Yarn and Cloth Distribution Committee" under its jurisdiction. The committee will have a business department with three groups for raw materials, export, and domestic sales. The raw materials group will be responsible for purchasing foreign cotton and distributing it to factories proportionally. The export group will manage export yarn and cloth business, using foreign exchange earned from exports to order raw materials and machinery, with the remainder returned to the National Bank. The domestic sales group will be responsible for the distribution of yarn and cloth in major cities nationwide to stabilize market prices. All yarn produced by factories must be submitted to the committee for allocation. A supervisory committee composed of representatives from the textile industry will be established under the joint distribution committee. The Central Bank will provide the necessary funds for the joint distribution committee.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Resume Collection of Commodity Tax on Domestically Produced Petroleum; Tax to be Levied at 3% of Market Value <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>According to sources from the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, the Ministry of Finance recently stated that petroleum is a mineral product. A mineral tax was previously levied, but in 1942, imported oil was approved by the government for tariff exemption, and domestically produced petroleum was temporarily exempted as well. Now, import taxes on gasoline and diesel, except for crude oil, have been reinstated, and the import taxes on gasoline, diesel, and kerosene have been uniformly increased to 50%. The ministry has ordered the immediate resumption of the mineral tax on domestically produced petroleum, with the following collection methods:</p>
<p>(1) The scope of taxation includes crude oil and gasoline, kerosene, diesel, machine oil, paraffin wax, asphalt, etc., refined from crude oil. If the crude oil tax has already been paid, the amount will be deducted when taxing gasoline, etc., refined from it. If import tax has already been paid on imported goods, tax exemption will be granted upon presentation of proof.</p>
<p>(2) The tax rate is set at 3% of the price. The taxable price and tax amount should be calculated based on the average wholesale price in the market for the most recent month, as determined by the commodity tax bureaus in each region.</p>
<p>(3) The unit of taxation is calculated per "gallon."</p>
<p>(4) For taxed petroleum, a tax-paid certificate will be issued, and stamps will be affixed and sealed on the oil drums and tanks.</p>
<p>(5) No supplementary tax will be required for goods that have already left the factory and are circulating in the market before the resumption of tax collection. However, when transporting goods to other locations, taxes should be levied according to regulations. Goods in storage at the factory should be taxed when they leave the factory.</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Commodity Tax Bureau issued a public notice to domestically produced petroleum manufacturers in the city, requiring them to submit a list of the names of the oil products they produce, the ratio of petroleum products used, and the average wholesale price of each type of oil to the bureau within five days for registration and taxation.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Ministry of Social Affairs Establishes Labor and Mining Inspection Office in Shanghai; Li Maoji Appointed Director <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote labor and mining inspection work, the Ministry of Social Affairs prepared to establish a Labor and Mining Inspection Office in Shanghai. Last month, trainees from the ministry's labor and mining inspection training class were sent to Shanghai for practical training. Half a month ago, they completed the practical inspection of 24 major industrial units in the city. The establishment of the office has been approved by the Executive Yuan. It was originally planned to officially establish the office after the staffing and funding were approved. However, due to the urgent need to start inspection work in the city, the Ministry of Social Affairs first ordered the office to be established in Shanghai. The funding will be temporarily allocated by the labor and mining inspection department of the Ministry of Social Affairs. All staff members will be selected from the graduates of the labor and mining inspection training class, with 16 members remaining in Shanghai to work. The position of director will be filled by Li Maoji, the head of the labor and mining inspection section of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The office will first begin factory investigation work. It is said that special attention will be paid to industrial equipment and the protection of child laborers in various factories in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e151">China Trust Bureau Releases Market Conditions for Tung Oil and Pig Bristles <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Barter Department of the China Trust Bureau released the following market conditions for tung oil and pig bristles from the 22nd to the 27th of this month:</p>
<p>Tung Oil: This week, the international tung oil market price declined because two or three major importers in New York were selling May-June futures at US$0.2375 per pound. In the second half of the week, due to the Easter holiday, users were not interested in offers from China, and there were no transactions. Currently, the spot price in New York is US$0.25 per pound. The price for bulk shipments loaded in Shanghai is CSF New York US$0.2425 to US$0.245 per pound. The price for iron drums in London is CLF £195 per long ton. Domestic oil prices are 7.5 million per 市担 in Shanghai, 5.37 million in Chongqing, 6.6 million in Hankou, 4.88 million in Wanxian, 6.45 million in Wuzhou, and 7.99 million in Guangzhou. Compared to the New York market price, based on the exchange rate for export drafts, the national currency price is about 20% below cost compared to the Shanghai market price. Pig Bristles: This week, pig bristle prices were firm in the United States due to a slight rebound in general prices. The price of Chongqing No. 27 black assorted bristles is CSF New York US$2.23 per pound, Hankou No. 17 black assorted bristles are US$3.35, Shanghai No. 17 black assorted bristles are US$2.235, and Tianjin Small No. 55 black assorted bristles are US$5.20.

<p>Due to frequent snowfalls last winter, the development of winter mushrooms in Anhui was strong. The continuous spring rain resulted in a poor spring mushroom harvest. The number of people growing them is not high, and the production volume is also low. Currently, the price of mushrooms is around 300,000 per catty.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Jiangxi Sugarcane Production Abundant; Provincial Government Plans to Restore Sugar Factory <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>[Our Poyang Dispatch, 25th] Jiangxi Province is located in the temperate zone with fertile soil. Especially the counties bordering Guangdong and Fujian in the southeast have entered the subtropical zone, which is most suitable for sugarcane planting. The most abundant production areas are Leping, Poyang, Wannian, Dexing, and Fuliang in the Raohe region; Ganxian, Nankang, and Dayu in the Ganhe region; and Linchuan and Chongren in the Fuhe region.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned production areas, Leping has the largest output. Therefore, the sugar production industry also thrived in the areas where sugarcane production is abundant in this province. Sugar production ranks third in the country, after Sichuan and Guangdong. At its peak, annual output was about 300,000 祖. The types of products include both red and white sugar in southern Jiangxi, while the rest are all brown sugar. However, due to poor manufacturing methods, sugar factories are often temporarily set up during the sugarcane harvest for production, and molasses cannot be separated. The quality is rough, so sales are limited to within the province, and half is consumed locally. The sugar industry has been difficult to develop.</p>
<p>Before the war, the provincial authorities had once planned to establish a fine sugar factory, but it was not implemented due to various reasons. In March 1937, Reici De, a consultant of the Ministry of Finance, came to Jiangxi to investigate the raw materials for wine-making plants and inquired about opinions on establishing a new large-scale sugar factory. He also discussed it in detail with the Industry and Commerce Administration Office. Regarding the location of the sugar factory, Nankang and Leping were chosen as potential sites. Leping is a major station along the Jinggan Railway, close to the Zhegan Railway; Nankang has the Gan River and highways connecting it, and both places have considerable transportation advantages. After Reici De's consultation, he greatly appreciated the important points contributed and promised to convey the opinions to the Ministry of Finance for selection. In the autumn of the same year, Director Gong Xue of the Construction Department went from the province to Hangzhou and then to Shanghai to contact the financial community in Shanghai to solicit shares for joint operation, with a capital of 1 million yuan, half from government and half from merchants. However, due to the outbreak of the war, neither the Nankang nor the Leping factories were built.</p>
<p>Recently, Xingye Company decided to establish a sugar factory in Ganxian to restore the sugar industry in the province. The required working capital is 1.5 billion yuan, and a loan has been negotiated with the bank. The factory is expected to produce five types of sugar: top-grade, medium-grade, white sugar, brown sugar, top leaks, and bottom leaks. It is estimated that the annual output will be 4,500 市祖. It will proceed with the purchase and production of sugarcane when the local sugarcane is harvested.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Agricultural Bank Provides Loans to Support Jiangxi Paper Production <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>[Our Poyang Dispatch] The counties of Shangrao, Guixi, Shicheng, Qianshan, Yiyang, Yushan, Dexing, etc., in eastern Jiangxi have the most abundant paper production. The yellow and white尖,夹版,连史,毛边,京仿,关山 paper produced are all gathered at 河口 and transported to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Hubei for sale. Recently, due to increased costs, paper makers lack funds for operation, and production has sharply decreased. In order to solve the domestic paper shortage and support the paper industry production in eastern Jiangxi, the Jiangxi branch of the Agricultural Bank has decided to provide loans directly to paper makers in the Qianshan and Shicheng production areas and send personnel to guide them to improve manufacturing methods and improve quality.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Bank of Taiwan Promotes the Four-Digit Counting System <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>[Yaguang News Agency, Taipei Dispatch] The Bank of Taiwan believes that the Western numeral system's reading method, in addition to the basic One, Ten, and Hundred, is Thousand, Billion, and Trillion above that. Each is separated by three digits. Therefore, when writing numbers, an apostrophe is added every three digits. The original purpose is to make long numbers clear by adding apostrophes to separate the digits, making them easier to read. For example, the number "600,000" is written as 600,000 by Westerners, read as Six Hundred Thousand, which is extremely convenient. However, in our country, there is no habit of reading 600,000 as Six Hundred Thousand. If we still want to ask about the Western-style three-digit apostrophe separation method, it is really a case of putting Zhang's hat on Li's head, incongruous and inappropriate, merely having the form of adding apostrophes without the effect of separating digits. According to our country's numeral reading method, it is divided into four digits and advanced by one level. Above the thousands place is the ten thousand place, and ten thousand 万 is a hundred million 亿, and ten thousand hundred million is a trillion 兆. The government has clearly stipulated that it is different from the Western numeral reading method. Therefore, the digit separation method in our country should be changed to a four-digit apostrophe separation, which is more appropriate. For example, 456.78 million is written as 45678,0000, which is not only easy to write but also easier to understand. If the Western writing method is used as 456,780,000, unless the Western reading method is changed to read 456 million 780 thousand, i.e., (Four Hundred Fifty Six Million, Seven Hundred Eighty Thousand), otherwise it will be blurred and difficult to read. Unless you memorize the digits of each apostrophe or count each digit one by one, it is difficult to read quickly. In order to meet the national conditions, facilitate the writing and reading of numbers, and correct past bad habits, the bank has specifically changed the numbers to the nationalized digit separation method of consistent writing and reading of four-digit apostrophes from April 1, 1948, and requests all circles to respond and promote its use.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Comparison of Wool Fabric Market Prices This Month <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Looking back at the wool fabric market prices this month, there has never been such a large and rapid increase in any previous period. The most important factors for this sharp rise are: the soaring prices of gold, paper money, rice, yarn, silk, oil, cigarettes, soap, side dishes, and daily necessities, the drastic increase in public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation, the unstable and uncertain situation, the entry of Northeast circulation coupons into the customs, the influx of speculative funds into this city, the crowd of people rushing to buy goods, the increasing exchange rate, and the decreasing value of legal tender. Now, we have selected and published several types of market prices this month. Compared to the red plate price on March 15, the average increase in 40 days reached 2.75 times.</p>
<p>Commodity March 5 March 15 March 25 February 15 Increase Rate</p>
<p>100 Light Plain Serge 1.9 million 2.5 million 2.75 million 1.15 million 2.5 times weaker</p>

<h3 id="e160">Current Status of Copper Product Production and Sales in Shanghai (Continued) <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Hao</p>
<p>There are currently fifteen or sixteen copper rolling mills in the city. At their peak production (1946), these mills could produce approximately 1,878 tons of copper sheets, 666 tons of copper wire, and 18 tons of copper tubes per quarter.</p>
<p>Regarding quality, the pure copper sheets produced by the mills lack adequate hardness due to technical deficiencies, and are not yet widely suitable for industrial needs. Therefore, the mills currently focus on producing brass sheets. The composition of these brass sheets is approximately 66-67% copper and 33-34% zinc. Recently, due to the high cost of raw materials, many manufacturers have been adding scrap copper to reduce costs, resulting in a gradual decline in quality.</p>
<p>Regarding raw materials, the domestic supply has been scarce due to transportation disruptions in recent years, forcing the mills to rely entirely on foreign supplies. Among foreign raw materials, Mexican "3T" copper ingots are the most popular. However, since the government implemented import restrictions, the availability of foreign materials has also become problematic. Therefore, mills must also purchase scrap copper from the market to sustain production.</p>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai Copper Rolling Industry Association applied to the Export-Import Control Committee for the second term (May, June, July) to import 14,747 dan of pure copper, 18,863 dan of brass, and 5,720 dan of zinc. However, the actual amount allocated was very small, making the raw material supply very difficult.</p>
<p>B. Metal Smelting Factories: The Shanghai Metal Smelting Industry Association currently has over 230 members. The association is located on East Zhongzheng Road, and Mr. Songling is the person in charge. The larger member factories of the association primarily focus on smelting cast iron, with copper smelting being only a secondary business. Among them, Shanghai Iron &amp; Steel Company has the largest scale and is a leader in the iron and steel smelting industry in Central China. These factories are effectively prototypes of heavy industry. Their products include pipe fittings, machinery, castings, valves, vehicle parts, textile machine parts, pliers, cigarette machines, and weaving machines.</p>
<p>Smaller factories are mostly copper sand casting plants, with staff ranging from just a few to a dozen people. Their products include drying pans for laundry, pure copper shafts for ironing wool fabrics in textile factories, bushings on engine axles, and machine parts.</p>
<p>Regarding production volume, the largest factories can forge approximately 60 to 70 tons of cast iron per month. Larger copper and lead sand casting plants produce an average of 150 to 200 dan of copper or lead per month. A prominent manufacturer is Hua Feng. This factory specializes in manufacturing various machines using tinplate (galvanized iron). Because tinplate is strong and durable, the machine parts made by Hua Feng are much more sturdy and durable than cast iron products. Therefore, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, China Textile Construction Corporation, various hydroelectric engineering firms, and the Shanghai Electric Power Company are all happy to use their products.</p>
<p>As for the raw materials used by the factories, in addition to a portion purchased from Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the main source is still scrap metal collected from the market.</p>
<p>C. Hardware Factories (i.e., Parts Manufacturing Factories): The Shanghai Hardware Industry Association currently has over 240 members. The association is located on Haining Road in this city, and Mr. Chu Shende is the person in charge. The largest member factories have 200 to 300 employees, while the smaller ones have only three to five people. In terms of equipment, in addition to common machine tools such as lathes, drilling machines, and planers, they also have various special machines to manufacture various hardware parts, depending on their needs. Brass is the most commonly used raw material. The products manufactured include plumbing supplies, various door locks, zippers, lighters, electrical appliances, watchbands, and watch parts. There are over 120 factories engaged in the above-mentioned industries, accounting for more than half of all members of the Hardware Industry Association. The pure copper industry is smaller, with over 30 factories. Their products include accessory parts for sanitary equipment, electrical appliances, teapots, and rice cookers. In addition, some factories specialize in manufacturing steel parts.</p>
<p>The factories have two sources for raw materials: one is to rely on the Resource Committee, importers, copper-tin dismantling firms, and hardware merchants for supply. The other is to apply to the Raw Material Allocation Office of the Export Control Committee for import raw material allocation. It is estimated that approximately 6 million pounds of raw materials are needed per quarter.</p>
<p>(4) Retailers</p>
<p>The production of copper products in the Shanghai area has been described in detail above. Now, let's introduce the sales situation. Copper products are diverse and have various uses, so the nature of the retailers also varies. They are respectively affiliated with the Copper and Tin Business Association, the Hardware Business Association, the Hardware Parts Business Association, and the Used Hardware Business Association. Among these four types of retailers, hardware stores are the most financially strong and have the widest business scope, making them leaders in the hardware retail industry. The following is a breakdown of each type:</p>
<p>(1) Hardware Stores: The Shanghai Hardware Business Association currently has 449 members, and Mr. Zhao Xianji is the person in charge. The association is located on Jiulong Road in Hongkou. The business scope of each member store is very broad. Because the stores have close ties with importers, they control various imported hardware products. The commodities they deal in include: metal products, including mineral sands and important auto parts; steel products, including bright ground shafts, tinplate, rebar, steel plates, steel rails, various copper products, and iron pipes; machinery, including various textile machines, steel ball bearings, shipbuilding materials, and various drill bits and screws.</p>
<p>(2) Copper, Tin, and Hardware Stores: The Shanghai Copper and Tin Business Association currently has 222 members, and Mr. Xiao Erjun is the person in charge. The association is located on Fangbang Middle Road in the southern city. The main business of copper, tin, and hardware stores is selling five metal products: copper, tin, lead, aluminum, and zinc. However, in terms of their business scope, they can be divided into two categories: dismantling firms and utensil shops. The former mainly deals in metal raw materials and semi-finished products, while the latter specializes in various light household utensils, commonly known as "coppersmith shops," which refers to this type of store.</p>
<p>Dismantling firms are mostly concentrated in the Beijing East Road area. They sell various red, yellow, and white copper sheets, copper wire, copper ingots, thick and thin copper tubes, various colored copper rods, various hard lead, blue lead sheets, lead wire, solder, galvanized iron sheets, zinc ingots, and antimony nickel. Their operating income is considerable. According to the price standard calculation, the average monthly sales can reach 30-40 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The source of goods for dismantling firms is partly purchased from Northeast China, North China, Yunnan, and other places. However, due to the recent transportation difficulties in these areas, the arrival of goods is very limited. Therefore, they mostly entrust importers to order directly from abroad to meet their needs. Among imported goods, copper sheets are mostly from England and Hong Kong, which are very popular in the market. The largest sizes are four feet by eight feet, and fourteen inches by forty-eight inches. American goods are thirty inches by sixty inches, and three feet by six feet. The thickest brass ingots have a diameter of up to three and a half inches, and gauze copper ingots can be as large as four and a half inches. The thickest copper tube is about four inches. In addition, there are phosphorus copper sheets, phosphorus copper plates, and phosphorus copper wire, also from Europe, America, or Hong Kong, which are very expensive, about four to ten times higher than domestic copper products.</p>
<p>Utensil shops specialize in various household items, such as copper door rings, teapots, copper locks, spittoons, copper hangers, candle holders, washbasins, and wine pots. This type of store is one of the traditional handicrafts in our country. Its main sales targets are old-fashioned families, farmers, and temples. Their business is most prosperous in winter, but in recent years, due to the unstable situation and the declining purchasing power of the people, their business is far from what it used to be. Larger utensil shops include Leyuanchang and seven or eight others. In addition to purchasing raw materials from dismantling firms, they also collect scrap metal from the market to supplement their supply.</p>
<p>(3) Hardware Parts: There are currently 482 hardware parts and materials stores in this city. The association is located on Tianjin Road, and Mr. Yu Youbiao is the person in charge. The main business of hardware parts stores is various accessories for building houses, such as sanitary equipment, door locks, screws, Samsung hacksaw blades, triangular drills, and human head abrasive cloth. In the past, this industry occupied a very important position in the entire hardware industry. However, in recent years, due to the lack of vitality in the construction industry, the business situation of hardware parts stores has also been significantly affected, and there has been a sharp decline. Apart from a small portion being domestic goods, 90% of the commodities they deal in come from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(4) Used Hardware Stores: There are currently over 320 used hardware stores in this city. The association is located on Zhifu Road, and Mr. Ge Shuming is the person in charge. Last year, due to the impact of the market downturn, the industry was difficult to maintain, and more than 100 stores closed down one after another. Although they have gradually resumed business this year, it is still difficult due to the difficulty of importing foreign goods and the difficulty of settling foreign exchange for overseas orders. In addition, the stock of domestic used goods is decreasing day by day, so they are still struggling.</p>
<p>The main business of used hardware stores is selling various used hardware. Some also place orders with Europe and the United States on behalf of customers. The sales of goods are wider in other places, and the goods sold are mainly building materials, water pipes, steel bars, and agricultural tools.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>The copper product industry is one of the important modern light industries. Its prosperity or decline is not only closely related to the future of the entire national industry, but also has a significant impact on national defense construction. Although the copper product industry has a long history in Shanghai, strictly speaking, it lacks a solid foundation. The reasons for this are nothing more than insufficient equipment, backward technology, scarcity of raw materials, and financial constraints. Even today, both in terms of quality and quantity, it is far behind the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. In the past six months, due to the rapid rise in foreign exchange rates and the gradual reduction in the allocation amount, the raw material supply has become even more insufficient, while the cost of living for workers has been rising month by month, causing most manufacturers to abandon their main business and compete to hoard raw materials in order to seek temporary profits, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>In short, the Shanghai copper product industry is full of sluggishness in both production and sales. The equipment of the two state-owned factories (Central Mint and Central Electrical Equipment Factory) is still insufficient, not to mention the other private small factories. Therefore, if we want to seek the development of the industry in the future, we still need the assistance of the government authorities and the efforts of the industry itself. We must first strive to enrich and improve the equipment and technology, first seek the progress of quality, and then seek the increase of production. At the same time, both production and sales parties should closely cooperate to achieve the effect of fingers and arms. Industry experts will surely agree! (End)</p>

<h3 id="e161">Dewey on Art and Freedom <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Bingxian</p>
<p>In art history, the artist's creative freedom has always been a controversial issue. Art seems to have been a battlefield between "freedom" and "totalitarianism," and "democracy" and "autocracy" from the beginning. The focus of the debate is on "what" and "how" the artist says. In totalitarian countries, the decision on these two issues is in the hands of the authorities. They only want to make art a "tool for imperial use," and they will not hesitate to impose various restrictions on artistic creation, such as setting up a censorship system, banning publications, and buying them off. In order to make these measures reasonable, they often put forward "a supreme goodness," a moral law, a religious truth, or a totalitarian theory, to make people believe that human happiness and salvation must be based on compliance with the country's premise. Plato regarded poets as a dangerous element threatening national security in "Laws." He said, "Legislators and poets are hostile, but if the latter's remarks do not contradict the national laws, he can be tolerated." Plato's view is only a philosophical basis, but it became a religious dogma in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church. Medieval Christians advocated asceticism to seek liberation in the afterlife. Art is a kind of enjoyment in this world, so it is regarded as a sin. Therefore, art has become their slavery under the oppression of the clergy. After the Reformation in the 16th century, emperors and nobles replaced the clergy. Since then, politicians and merchants have been proud to be the "patrons" of art. After the First World War, three kinds of totalitarianism rose: Bolshevism, Fascism, and Roman Papalism. Although they are all similar and contradictory groups, they all took it as their responsibility to drive art. They adopted the same logic to prove the correctness of their actions, and they used the same methods to harm art. In fact, their actions are enough to show that art has a great influence on human minds and thoughts. Art is a tool for heart-to-heart resonance. If art is just the artist's personal "soliloquy," no one will pay attention to it. Totalitarians want to control art because they are afraid that once art is out of control, it will be like a horse running wild, galloping endlessly. The artist's imagination produces many strange thoughts and ideas, and shouts out many brand-new and beautiful nouns. As a result, the artist's imaginary world is often incompatible with the totalitarian reality. Undoubtedly, the rulers will try their best to reject this kind of disruptive thing of liberation.</p>
<p>However, the position of art is different in another environment. No one would destroy art in a free society, because the novel ideas generated by artistic activities can enhance the health and development of a free society. Dewey believes that the enthusiasm and beauty of art, as a result of the enhancement, extension, and purification of ordinary experience, become the mutual agreement of "shared meaning," which unites many different hearts. Every new idea is equal to strengthening the power of this kind of fellowship. The freedom of art is the perfection of a free society. The British poet Shelley believes that the person who pleases is the true creator of a free society and sets the ideal of life for us. This statement is consistent with Dewey's argument.</p>
<p>In the book "Art as Experience," there is a very detailed and insightful discussion on the position of art in ordinary life. This book is compiled based on his speeches at Harvard in 1932. In fact, it is a retelling of Dewey's experience, but this time it focuses on art. Dewey believes that man is an organic body, a part of society. He does not believe that people are born with individualism in this world. He is just a part of the body. In the constantly changing relationship between many other human natures and values, he recognizes his reality. His eternal and urgent request is to enrich this relationship, and this wealth is freedom. The satisfaction of freedom becomes wisdom. In addition to food, clothing, warmth, and warmth, human beings also need a rich spiritual life. Dewey advocates the use of "inquiry" and "re-evaluation" to obtain the free exchange of "common meaning." Wisdom is not a private ability, but a public force, a convergence and popularization of the achievements accumulated over the ages. Personal contribution is just a trickle. Therefore, Dewey extremely hates so-called absolute individualism. He does not approve of the too strict division of modern science. All things in the universe are closely related to each other. Although the methods of learning and learning each form a system on the surface, they cannot be separated in fact. They are all an important part of a "process."</p>
<p>This "process" is the experience of life. Normal continuation. In the process of pursuing freedom and survival and development, human experience is complex and unpredictable. Slowly, we obtain coordination from contradictions and obtain stability from chaos. Then we realize the passionate life in an instant; at this time, we understand that the relationship between the source of life is "law," and the connection of life changes is "form." We call this kind of experience "aesthetic experience." Any kind of experience can become "aesthetic experience." Even the most practical things can become works of art. The creation of art is to cut and polish the raw and shallow things, and give them new value and form. As a result, it becomes "a new material for the accumulation of experience." It is not an escape from the reality of theory to the mysterious world. This new experience changes and expands without interruption with the passage of time. Therefore, works of medicine or philosophy neither predict the world nor explain the world, they only express the world. The value and meaning of both plastic arts and non-plastic arts are expressed by "visible and audible properties." This "property" is the material used in the artwork: such as the clay, marble, or copper of the sculptor, the painter's pigments, and the musician's voice. The materials, forms, and contents used in a work of art are unified and inseparable. Goethe said, "Nature has no core and no number." Dewey has the same view of art. The artistic experience is the unity of "truth" and "ideal," "surface" and "depth," "perception" and "idea." Art gives us novelty and beauty. It does not teach us, nor does it bear any mission. Art is a public language, which is jointly participated in and appreciated by people with different languages and cultures. Therefore, the most important work of culture is to provide human beings with rich aesthetic experiences. In fact, the task of culture is to spread the art of life. Artworks are the most intimate and powerful tools to help individuals work together in the art of life. Dewey said that the world today is facing the arduous task of merging the cultural heritage of the past with modern knowledge. It is obvious that art is most suitable for undertaking this task. Because every art puts "a group of appearances and meanings that have no aesthetic sense in themselves" into "a regulated and rhythmic action that tends to perfection" and becomes an aesthetic experience, this art is equivalent to exemplifying this kind of ever-pursuing convergence.</p>
<p>In short, the essential element of the lifestyle of a democratic society lies in the common life and common experience based on continuous free exchange. This means that art should create an exchange of emotions and thoughts between people and make the people one. As art gradually develops and shines, the world and life will appear rich and splendid. The peak of art is the ultimate goodness and beauty of freedom.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Aristotle's Method of Learning <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Buidang</p>
<p>Aristotle's method of learning. On the one hand, it is logic, on the other hand, it is field observation. Logic is the industry he inherited from Plato and expanded, and field observation is his own wealth. Plato's dialectics is actually a concrete and subtle induction and deduction. As long as we open his books, we can see that: every time he discusses a problem, he must first cite examples from daily life, then refer to the generally accepted views in common sense, and then draw conclusions based on the habits and rules of language or words, or establish a concept of a certain type of behavior or things. Aristotle did not oppose this method, and actually used it himself, but he was not very satisfied with it, thinking that it was not accurate enough and not complete enough. Therefore, he devoted himself to adding and revising it. The result of the addition and revision became a special methodology.</p>
<p>As for his achievements in addition and revision, they can be divided into two aspects: (1) Concerning the deductive method. - The deduction of the B-family is based only on the ordinary habits and rules of language and words. A-family believes that this is unreliable, because there are many common errors in language and words, as well as other brief omissions, which cannot completely represent the procedure of thought; as a result of his meticulous research, he invented the so-called three-branch method (Syllogism), and various other patterns and rules on the logic. This has become the true deductive logic (Deductiv logic). (2) Concerning the inductive method. - The materials used in the induction of the B-family are only examples from daily life and views from common sense. A-family thinks that they are not enough and unreliable, because the facts touched in daily life are limited after all, and the views from common sense are often wrong. It is better to go directly to the most fixed and most reliable natural world to find materials. His claim changed the direction of the past induction method and opened a new path for the future induction method. With his claim, there was the induction method advocated by Francis Bacon (1564-1626) later, and the modern scientific method.</p>
<p>Although A-family told us that the materials of the natural world are more reliable, and pointed out the way for field observation, his success in this regard, from the perspective of modern times, is still limited. However, this cannot be blamed on him. He has already done his best. What is left is the limitation of the era. His era had two obstacles that made his achievements inferior to later science: (1) the active trend of thought, (2) the lack of the passive aspect. The so-called trend of thought is the atmosphere of meditation and dialectics of the B-family. At that time, the atmosphere of field observation had not yet begun. A-family can still be regarded as the first advocate. The success of the first advocate is often not as good as that of the successor, which is also the inevitable trend. The so-called lack refers to the lack of instruments. When he was studying at that time, he had no clocks and watches but had to calculate time, no thermometers but had to measure temperature, no barometers but had to test the climate, and no telescopes but had to look at astronomy. All he had was a ruler, a compass, and one or two extremely simple tools.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Rumor Psychology (1) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zheng</p>
<p>A rumor is a kind of oral legend, the content of which is inevitably unfounded, but it is the most primitive form of news. Especially when a country is in a time of crisis, and all news is controlled, and the people are most concerned about current affairs but cannot obtain sufficient information, rumors arise in abundance. At this time, we find two kinds of news in conflict: one is the official formal report, and the other is the informal folk legend. Official reports are organized propaganda, while folk legends are disorganized rumors. But the result is always that rumors prevail. Why doesn't organization generate power in such circumstances? We will discuss this from three aspects: the psychological origin of rumors, the spread of rumors, and social psychology. This article will start with the first point.</p>
<p>In 1857, the Great Indian Rebellion can be considered a famous example of rumors. At that time, the bullets used in soldiers' Mauser rifles were not as convenient as they are today. The gunpowder was loaded in a cartridge, and when firing, it was first necessary to bite open the fat-coated oil paper on the gunpowder cartridge before the gunpowder could be poured into the muzzle and fired. Rumors arose from this small piece of oil paper. The Muslims in the army heard that the oil paper was coated with lard, which they considered the greatest insult, because pigs are considered the most unclean animals by Muslims. The Hindus in the army heard that these fats were beef tallow, and in this way, they would violate the sacred cow and suffer great misfortune. Thus, whether Muslim or Hindu, everyone was angered and rebelled together. After the British government discovered this rumor, it immediately tried its best to dispel it, no matter how it explained or how it used cheese to replace the tallow, but the result still could not suppress the power of the rumor. Why? The origin of rumors has very deep psychological reasons. Indians hated the British government, and the emotion of hatred found an outlet in rumors.</p>
<p>Unless we understand the impact of repression on individual psychology, we cannot understand why rumors are so moving. Many things that cannot be said on weekdays can now be said casually, which is a very pleasant release for repressed emotions. Therefore, ordinary people who would never lie on weekdays, when they encounter rumors, even if they know that they lack a factual basis, they still talk about them incessantly. The reason is, "hearsay," no one has a "sense of responsibility," so-called "just say it for what it's worth, just listen to it for what it's worth." Lack of a sense of responsibility is a major reason for the prevalence of rumors.</p>
<p>The psychoanalytic school says that dreams are due to the psychological phenomenon of escaping responsibility. Therefore, rumors are somewhat similar to dreams, with less rational components and more emotional components. Rumors, like dreams, satisfy desires that cannot be satisfied on weekdays. For example, a subordinate treats his superiors with the utmost respect on weekdays, not daring to criticize them at all. If there is a rumor that is detrimental to his superiors, he will treat this news as if he has won a treasure, and spread it to everyone he meets. For example, he knows very well that his superior is in very good health, but if there is a rumor that he will retire to recuperate, he will still embellish the matter and spread it to others, because this satisfies a kind of desire in him—the psychology of disliking his superiors. His respect for his superiors on weekdays conceals a kind of rebellious emotion. The fulfillment of desires Wisn fulfillment, as discussed by the psychoanalytic school, is exactly as such.</p>
<p>Rumors, like dreams, are mostly immoral, or at least more destructive than constructive. This is also due to the irresponsibility of "thus I have heard," just like the anonymous posters and slanderous leaflets. Constructive criticism, or well-intentioned advice, can be said without any scruples, so there is no need to beat around the bush. Only destructive criticism is usually not dared to be said casually, so when the opportunity arises, it is seized, so rumors are mostly bad news, so-called "good news does not go out the door, bad news travels a thousand miles." In addition, people are all eager to win, and always want to be in a superior position. The most convenient way to maintain one's sense of superiority is to degrade the status of others. "Talking about the shortcomings of others" is the usual characteristic of rumors.</p>
<p>In addition, we can find another reason to explain defamation-like rumors. We falsely accuse others of committing crimes precisely because we ourselves want to commit crimes but do not have the opportunity, so we use rumors to vent this impulse. For example, like the fox in the fable, it admires the ripe grapes, but because they grow too high to reach, it mocks the grapes as sour to comfort itself. Many people want to be corrupt themselves but do not have the opportunity, so they are most enthusiastic about exposing corruption. Many old maids like to talk about the impropriety of a certain Mrs. or Miss, and many female students like to spread rumors that so-and-so has a lover. The psychological background is all similar. As the saying goes: "The one who comes to tell you right and wrong is the one who is right and wrong." If one is not familiar with the matter, everything said should be treated as a passing breeze. Who would be happy to mention it? Only things that one is most passionate about are easy to hear and most enthusiastic to spread. The rumors from an individual's mouth project the individual's inner depths.</p>
<h3 id="e164">About Professor Whitehead <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>The recently deceased great British philosopher Professor A. N. Whitehead, his life, works, thoughts, and character have been briefly introduced by the author (see Issue 14 of this publication). The author has much to say about Whitehead. He is a giant in the contemporary intellectual world. His thoughts are rich and profound, and will inevitably become the object of study for future scholars, and will inevitably become the object of diverse interpretations. The author does not fully understand him. However, among contemporary philosophers, there are probably not many who can thoroughly understand his thoughts.</p>
<p>The British philosopher Russell (B. Russell) is naturally also considered a great contemporary philosopher. He co-authored the book "Principia Mathematica" with Whitehead and also studied under Whitehead. He should be the one who can best understand Whitehead's thoughts. However, after Whitehead's book "Process and Reality" was published, Russell went to Harvard University in the United States to give a lecture. Whitehead was the chairman, and after introducing Russell, Russell said: "I do not understand Professor Whitehead's new book very well." The author was also reading this new book by Whitehead at the time, and was struggling to understand it. Hearing Russell's words, I felt a lot of comfort in my heart. But Russell's inability to understand Whitehead may be because their two lines of thought are different. Whitehead said the following when introducing Russell: "When we two co-wrote the book "Principia Mathematica," we agreed on the symbols themselves, but we disagreed on the meaning of the symbols." Therefore, the text part of the "Mathematical Logic" book is mostly from Russell's hand, and the symbol part is a collaboration between the two.</p>
<p>Whitehead's book "Process and Reality" is indeed difficult to understand. Not only Russell did not understand this book, but another famous philosopher, Ms. Stebbing, also expressed difficulty in understanding this book. She published a book review in the October 1930 issue of the journal "Mind". Her conclusion is that either the thought in this book is too profound for people of our generation to judge, or this book is a product of fundamentally unclear thought, illuminated by deep insights. Whitehead was quite angry when he saw this comment. One day, he talked to the students in the "Metaphysics Research Class" about the relationship between thought and language. He believed that language cannot fully express thought, let alone philosophical thought. We want to express existing philosophical thoughts with the limited terms of traditional philosophy, which is bound to fail. The reason why he created many new words and new sentences in philosophy is to remedy this defect. Therefore, those who read philosophical books cannot rely solely on language, but must strive to think deeply and seek the meaning beyond language. He solemnly said to the students: "Philosophy is not a science for armchair thinkers." In other words, philosophy is not a science for lazy thinkers. When reading philosophy, one cannot expect to understand it immediately. If one does not understand it after reading it once, one should not assume that there is a problem with the philosophical thought. This is a sign of intellectual laziness. This sentence made a deep impression on the author, and I hope that Chinese scholars will also pay attention to this statement.</p>
<p>At Harvard University, Whitehead taught two courses each semester, one was a lecture course and the other was a discussion course. The lecture course in the first semester was: "New and Old Cosmology," and the second semester was: "Philosophy and Science." The discussion course in the first semester was metaphysics and the second semester was logic. Some people today say that the elderly should not teach. Observing Whitehead, we know that this statement is unreliable.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Anecdotes from the Academic World (15) <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Modern European and American Thoughts (Continued)</p>
<p>(6) Intuitionism of the Frenchman Bergson (Henri Bergson, 1859-19, regarded instinct as a good child and intelligence as a bad child. The sophistication of instinct is called intuition. He believed that intuition is obtained through introspection, and intelligence is obtained through external contact. Intuition is linked to time, and wisdom is linked to space. Intuition is comprehensive rather than analytical, and can intersect the past and the future, so it has foresight. Bergson believed that the stream of life rushes forward, and the impulse and struggle of life all depend on intuition. He advocated acting for the sake of action, and thought is just a tool for action. Wisdom is like a dream, engaging in pure thinking without being active. Logic and mathematics cannot be positive spiritual activities. Bergson's theory emphasizes action over knowledge and opposes reason. Russell believed that his theory was dogmatic and lacked evidence. Bergson's writing is also in the tradition of Romanticism since Rousseau, and he and reason are in direct conflict. If he cannot reject reason, reason will rise up and overthrow him. If his theory does not stand, then it is just an epic full of imagination, enough to be appreciated. Russell said that the Vichy government in France during the war was related to Bergson's thought because it focused on action and insisted on its own way, which would inevitably lead to conservatism in politics.</p>
<p>(7) Instrumentalism Bacon first created the saying that knowledge is power, wanting to use scientific inventions and discoveries to achieve the goal of humans conquering nature. The purpose of theoretical science is to understand the world, and the purpose of applied science is to transform the world. The influence of applied science on practical politics began at the end of the eighteenth century. Due to the manufacture of machines, mechanical transportation, and the application of coal, oil, and electricity, production has flourished, waterfalls can become power, and deserts can be turned into gardens, as if there is nothing that cannot be done in the world. The speed of progress in modern mechanical civilization and the development of large-scale production are especially prominent in the United States. The philosophy of the American Dewey (John Dewey, born in 1859) reflects the industrial culture of this era, and can be named the power philosophy of instrumentalism. Dewey takes the process of exploration as a synonym for truth, and excessively emphasizes effectiveness, so it cannot avoid the view of judging heroes by success or failure. Russell believed that the success or failure of human affairs may not all be describable. If everything must seek effect, and effect has effect, and there is endless pursuit, there must be no place to stop. The drawbacks of instrumentalism are similar to those of Romanticism, except that Dewey, unlike the Nietzsche school, thinks from the perspective of individual power, but from the perspective of collective power, but both are a kind of power philosophy. Russell quoted Santayana's criticism of Dewey, saying that he "disintegrates the individual and pulverizes the truth," to show his concern. Dewey's school is too intoxicated with the infinite power of science, which is too much. Russell has concerns about this. Now the war potential of various countries has increased due to the progress of science and technology, and if there is no way to prevent war, the result may lead to a general destruction.</p>
<p>(8) Logical Analysis This school is a new philosophy that keeps pace with the times after the invention of relativity and quantum theory in the early twentieth century. Synthesis is based on experience, and analysis is based on logic. Naming it logical analysis can express the thought method of this school. Modern physics, due to the success of atomic theory, has reduced its material meaning, and psychology has also reduced its mental meaning due to the progress of physiology. The two move towards each other, and there is no strict distinction between mind and matter. There is no so-called matter, no so-called mind, only events. This simplified new worldview is called Neutral Monism, or Eventism. The representative figure of this school should be Russell himself. He believed that philosophy should be pragmatic with scientific methods, but it needs to go further than science. Science only asks about causes, not purposes, only asks about parts, not the whole. Philosophy is to make up for what science has not achieved. Scientists before the Renaissance only asked about purposes, which led science to a dead end, which is certainly not worth emulating. The new philosophy encouraged by modern science often focuses on tools and techniques, the so-called "only power is seen," and does not deeply consider the purpose, which also has the disadvantage of becoming arrogant. Russell believed that future new trends of thought must prescribe the right medicine for power philosophy to correct its bias. For the above-mentioned schools, we must adopt their strengths and discard their weaknesses. For all wisdom and action, utility and motivation, political human rights and economic human rights, we must take them all in and not tend to extremes. As for the philosophies of ancient and medieval times, there are also many timeless truths in them that need to be harmonized and integrated to achieve the goal of collecting a great collection. Russell comprehensively discussed the relationship between heaven and man, believing that Greece feared heaven, the Middle Ages respected heaven, modern times valued the self, and the present world valued the group. Each has its own grand purpose and cannot be abandoned. Science cannot encompass everything. He believed that as a result of the progress of modern science and technology, the world has been transformed into a whole, but the structure of politics and society has not been able to match it, and the reason for the great war lies here. Russell's ideal new philosophy advocates neutral monism or eventism in its worldview, and advocates integrating ancient, medieval, and modern times in its view of life, and further integrating the East and the West. We must know the new to warm the old, and then transform from the old to the new. Only with such a sound new philosophy as the hub of the new culture can we adapt to the requirements of the atomic age. Democracy is not without its shortcomings, but it has the fewest shortcomings among various political systems. There must be democracy at home, and it should be the same internationally, so that the world can maintain peace for a long time. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e166">Schopenhauer's Theory of Education <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Shaoxiong</p>
<p>Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) of the nineteenth century was a genius and a famous pessimist. We may not agree with his pessimism, but his judgments in other areas often have deep observations and unique insights, which we cannot obliterate. In his collection of essays, there is an article on education. This article has many similarities with the theories of modern educators, and it is worth introducing to us. This is the purpose of this article.</p>
<p>We know that Schopenhauer was an idealist in philosophy. He inherited Kant and made some modifications to Kant's theory. But in his educational advocacy, he leans toward empiricism. He believes that there are two types of educational methods: natural education and artificial education. The so-called natural education is a method that emphasizes special observations and special experiences to obtain universal views or knowledge. Human universal concepts are obtained by abstracting from special observations. This is to be obtained after special observation, after a considerable period of time. A person who has no teacher and no books, his acquisition of knowledge depends entirely on his own experience. Such a person knows very well which of his special observations belong to a certain universal concept, and are represented by a certain universal concept. He knows both special observations and universal concepts very clearly, and he will not make mistakes, so he can handle any event from the correct point of view. This is the advantage of natural education. Conversely, the so-called artificial education is a method that emphasizes oral instruction and books, and is mainly based on the injection of universal concepts. This method is to listen to the oral instruction of teachers and elders, to study, and to read books before humans have had extensive contact with the universe itself, and before they have observed for themselves, filling their minds with many universal concepts. Your teachers and elders will tell you that the special observations that constitute these universal concepts will be obtained in your future experiences. However, before the special observations have been obtained, you will use the universal concepts incorrectly, and you will judge people and things from the wrong point of view, and observe them and deal with them with the wrong views and in the wrong ways. So this kind of education distorts the human mind.</p>
<p>Education does not use natural methods, but uses artificial methods, which explains why many people who read a lot of books and have knowledge often lack common sense, and often make wrong judgments or act wrongly. The reason is that although this kind of person is full of many abstract universal concepts, he just starts to use them, so it is difficult to use them correctly. The education he has received violates the natural development of the mind, that is, the development from concrete to abstract, reversing it, with the injection of abstract concepts first, and special observation later. This kind of education does not first develop children's cognitive functions, nor does it first teach children to observe and think for themselves, but instead uses all of its effort to forcefully inject other people's thoughts and existing concepts into children's minds. In this way, after the child grows up, all that is in his mind are those abstract concepts of others, and these concepts are never all correct, and many are wrong. With these preconceived notions, later experiences can be corrected, but it is difficult to completely correct them, and it is not easy to correct them. In this way, when a person who only has abstract concepts observes a fact that is contrary to his abstract concepts, he can regard the fact as partial, as incomplete, and reject it; he can also completely ignore the fact, deny that the fact is contradictory to his abstract concepts, and try his best to preserve his abstract concepts. This is the reason why many people are entangled by prejudices, illusions, and wrong ideas throughout their lives and cannot extricate themselves. To correct human wrong ideas, this kind of education must first be corrected.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer believes that correct education must conform to the natural development of the human mind, that is, it should be mainly based on natural education. According to this kind of education, special observation should be before universal concepts, and narrower views should be before broader views. Any concept should be instilled according to the procedure by which the concept is constructed, and cannot be overleaped. The concepts that we should give to children must be concepts that children can observe for themselves, and in any case, must be concepts that can be verified by observation. In this way, although the concepts obtained by children are few, they are all well-founded and correct. In this way, children can learn how to use their own standards, not the standards of others, to judge things. He can avoid many misunderstandings and prejudices. Therefore, the way to educate children should not be to put books in front of children first, but to gradually let children come into contact with things and the actual life environment. Our work is to guide children to obtain clear and objective views on the universe, and also to guide them to obtain their concepts directly from practical life, and to make their concepts consistent with practical life. We should try to prevent children from obtaining their concepts from books, fairy tales, and the words of others, because the concepts obtained in this way are mostly wrong and mostly inconsistent with practical life. The main task of education lies here. Therefore, Schopenhauer advocates that before children reach the age of fifteen, all abstract subjects with more divergent opinions and more possible errors, such as philosophy, religion, etc., should not be taught. What can be taught are subjects with more consistent opinions and fewer errors, such as mathematics, natural sciences, languages, history, etc. The teaching of the former type of subjects should wait until the child has grown up, has sufficient experience, and has the ability to judge. Even novels, Schopenhauer does not advocate letting children read, because children are easily influenced by novels and construct many wrong ideas.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer's theory of education is roughly as described above. Although his views have arguable points, in general, they are correct and consistent with the theories of contemporary educators.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Happiness and Troubles <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>There are very few lucky children in the world who have never had troubles, but there are many unfortunate people who have never known what happiness is. When you come into contact with anyone around you, you will mostly find that they are troubled by something. Naturally, you yourself are often likely to be one of them.</p>
<p>People are fond of "happiness" and hate "troubles", but troubles do not therefore seem distant to you. On the contrary, they will still descend on your head at any time, making you unable to get rid of them. Because of this, people often lament that they are no longer innocent children. They think that only children are angels who do not know troubles and are the happiest, and adults are forever entangled with "troubles". Some people also feel that the troubles in the world cannot be isolated, so they entrust their souls to religion, hoping to get some happiness and warmth under the protection of "God". There are even a group of hedonists who feel that life is both short and troublesome, and if they do not enjoy themselves in time, they are really wasting their lives. So they indulge in sensual pleasures and obtain some sensory stimulation, which is what they consider satisfying "happiness".</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the path they desire and pursue "happiness" is completely wrong. It is a naive idea to hope to return to childhood and live a kind of unconscious and inexplicable "happy" life. It is also a wrong concept to think that if you believe in religion, the god of happiness will descend from heaven. Because even the most efficacious "God" sometimes cannot save you from all the "troubles" of reality. As for the happiness pursued by the general hedonistic school, it is even more pitiful and sad, because they simply do not understand the meaning of life and happiness.</p>
<p>True happiness requires many conditions to be matched. Without a sound outlook on life, it is really impossible to talk about any happiness. These many matching conditions are your knowledge, cultivation, ability to deal with reality, and adaptability to the environment. A sound outlook on life will never simply be fond of the life of childhood, nor will it confusedly dedicate a heart to "God", or exhaust all the spirit in indulging in pleasure. A sound outlook on life can tell you what things should be thought about, what things do not need to be thought about too much, and how to relieve unavoidable troubles, so as to enter the realm of happiness.</p>
<p>Troubles are often an unnecessary loss of spirit. A wise person does not let his precious life pass in troubles. A rich gentleman is upset because his housing lottery ticket did not win, and a wife laments because she has one less son or cannot get a few carat diamond ring, all of which are unnecessary troubles, because they only harm you, without any compensation or construction.</p>
<p>Yes, in the journey of life, you will often encounter many things that cannot make you happy, but you should use your wisdom and courage to overcome this difficult obstacle—again and again, fight on. At the same time, when overcoming and eliminating these many troubles, if you want to borrow other forces to help you, it is still unreliable, and the struggle for happiness still depends on yourself.</p>

<p>— Meng Wu</p>
<p>When Mark Twain's writing career began, although he had a small reputation, his income was still very meager, and sometimes he even felt very financially strained.</p>
<p>Once, a local comedian was willing to pay him fifty U.S. dollars as a reward, asking Mark Twain to write half a dozen "jokes" for use in the play. Unexpectedly, this witty master of humor immediately refused and said to the man:</p>
<p>"If I accept this deal, both of our reputations will be ruined!"</p>
<p>"What does this have to do with our reputations?" the comedian asked very puzzled.</p>
<p>"If you come on stage and perform six very wonderful jokes, then the audience will definitely think you stole them from someone else. They will say you are a thief! As for me, I am a very poor person, often penniless. If people find out I have fifty dollars, they will definitely think I stole it, and they will also call me a 'thief'. In this way, wouldn't both of us be discredited?"</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Mystery of the Sky <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— A Duan</p>
<p>Zi You Tan (Free Talk) has already published an article by Mr. Sun He discussing UFOs, saying that last year's UFOs were actually American academic national body experimental rocket weapons. But on the 25th of this month, I read a news report about "flying saucers" appearing in the sky over Switzerland: "The Swiss News Agency reported: Yesterday afternoon, a giant ball of light was discovered in the sky over the village of Weinfelden in northeastern Switzerland, and it flew rapidly southward. Later, in central Switzerland, a luminous flying saucer with a long tail was seen again, flying directly west... Our agency's reporter took a train from Turin to Rome and also saw a comet-like object flying in the sky. Although the train was roaring, the loud sound of the object flying could still be heard."</p>
<p>In fact, in the past hundred years, newspapers and magazines have often published news of mysterious "flying objects" appearing. Most people think that the "flying saucer" is the most mysterious, but compared with the flying buckets, flying pigs, flying horses, flying pythons, flying people, flying bells... that appeared in the sky before, the "flying saucer" is really nothing to mention. But why are people particularly shocked by "flying saucers"? In a word, it's all because the international situation after the war is turbulent and uncertain, and people have become much more sensitive.</p>
<p>It is said that in 1878, a farmer in western Virginia, USA, personally witnessed a white horse with silkworm wings flying over his head. In 1905, many residents in Yierqi saw a pair of pigs about ten feet long flying across the sky.</p>
<p>In 1873, many farmers in Texas began to panic, because in broad daylight, a thick python flew over their heads. A New York newspaper condemned this incident as the most "absurd and unfounded" talk, but soon after, "flying pythons" also appeared in Kansas.</p>
<p>In 1881, residents of Virginia and Delaware saw a soldier in uniform and a little angel in white flying quickly across the sky.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing is the flying "cigar". On the night of April 9, 1897, something shaped like a "cigar" appeared in the sky over Chicago, with huge wings and emitting red, white, and blue light.</p>
<p>Scientists also witnessed the appearance of the "flying cigar". A scientist explained that this flying object was the Southern Cross star, which emitted three colors of light due to the influence of the atmosphere, but this scholar did not explain why only the Southern Cross star was affected by the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Later, at 9 pm on April 19, red, white, and blue lights appeared in the northeast corner of the town of Cheston in Virginia. Observed through optical glass, this thing was conical in shape and about one hundred and eighty feet long.</p>
<p>What exactly is this "flying cigar"? What is the "flying python"? For questions like these, there is only this answer: the mystery of the sky has not yet been revealed, and it is still a confusing "mystery". (This article is taken from the February issue of Crown Magazine)</p>
<h3 id="e170">Five Schools of Visiting Mother <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Hong</p>
<p>"Si Lang Visits His Mother" is the most popular play in Peking opera. From sitting in the palace to returning orders, it occupies two male roles (Si Lang and Liu Lang), three female roles (Empress Dowager Xiao, Princess Iron Mirror, and Fourth Madam), one old woman (She Taijun), a young man (Yang Zongbao), and two clowns (guards). It is basically a play that emphasizes both male and female roles. Originally, the Fourth Madam was the main female role, and the princess was the supporting female role. Chen Delin played the Fourth Madam in Er Huang Zheng Ban style, and Wang Yaoxiang played the princess, only singing Xipi Yao Ban when she appeared, which was indeed a supporting role. However, later the princess became the main female role and was promoted to the protagonist, while the Fourth Madam became a supporting role instead. Si Lang and the princess are both protagonists in the play, but this play is starred by the male role, and the princess can only be regarded as a supporting protagonist. There are five schools of old male roles performing the visit to the mother, namely Wang Guifen, Sun Juxian, Tan Xinpei, Liu Hongsheng, and Xu Yintang. The performances of these five schools have different advantages, which are written below:</p>
<p>(1) Wang School: Wang Guifen is also known as Wang Datou. He performed "Visiting Mother" during the Tongzhi period. At that time, the singing method did not have any florid embellishments, and emphasized full bowing and full tones, with correct pronunciation. In Xipi Zheng Ban "Yang Yan Hui Sits in the Palace Courtyard," there was usually a short interlude before singing the four words "Zi Si Zi Tan" (self-thinking, self-sighing). The Wang School's singing method omits this short interlude and uses tones to fill in the gaps in the short interlude, completing the four words "Zi Si Zi Tan" in one breath. It is extremely difficult to cope with without true inner strength. This is the only characteristic of the Wang School, and the ending sounds all originate from the nasal cavity. Wang Guifen is the only one who is good at using nasal sounds. Later, Wang Fengqing also learned the Wang School's singing method, but because there were no florid embellishments in the singing, it was not liked by society.</p>
<p>(2) Sun School: Sun Juxian was from Tianjin. People in Beijing and Tianjin call him "Old Fellow Villager" and also "Sun Yile," because Sun is an optimistic person among actors. He regards performing on stage as a game. No matter what play it is, his singing and acting are very hasty. However, relying on his broad and bright voice and abundant inner strength, his voice can shake the roof tiles and stop the clouds when he releases it. It is tragic and passionate, and extraordinary. Therefore, he can also form his own school. The biggest advantage of his performance of "Visiting Mother" is that he can drag out the long tones. When he sees his mother, he sings "Go to the back tent and take a look at my mother's daughter-in-law and son's wife, I'll be right back," and the "lai" (come) character can be dragged out until he enters the stage. When he reaches the backstage, the lingering sound is lingering, and the audience can still hear it faintly in the front stage. His abundant inner strength is like this, which is a major feature of the Sun School. Later, Hui Bao's performance of "Visiting Mother" was also called "Locomotive," which refers to the extremely long tail tone of the "lai" character.</p>
<p>(3) Tan School: Today's performers of "Visiting Mother" have all kinds of florid embellishments, innovate and introduce new things, which is almost based on the Tan School. Tan wins with soft tones, and each paragraph has its advantages. The intonation can be as nuanced as possible. The tone when crying in the hall is sad and poignant, and thought-provoking. Later, Yu Shuyan made slight improvements, but still did not escape the framework of the Tan School. The performances of Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen today are also a compromise between Tan and Yu. However, Ma Lianliang's performance has undergone some changes, but it still does not deviate from the scope of the Tan School. The Tan School's "Visiting Mother" has the most advantages and can be called the most perfect.</p>
<p>(4) Liu School: Liu Hongsheng was an amateur actor, and the play "Visiting Mother" was one of his masterpieces. Liu's voice was high-pitched and his pronunciation was sweet and mellow. Whether it was Zheng Ban, Yuan Ban, or even Liushui, it was all completed in one breath. The "fan" character in "Standing at the Palace Gate Calling the Little Fan" had a sharp and straight upward pitch without any effort. The crying tone uses a high pitch, which is also the opposite of the Tan School. His huqin tune is always above the B character, and only Chen Wenqi, Wu Kunfang, and Wu Caixia can play the supporting roles. Ma Fuxian played the princess for him in "Visiting Mother," and eventually died of vomiting blood due to the high pitch.</p>
<p>(5) Xu School: Xu Yintang was a disciple of Zhang Erkui. His performance was the Kui School's old male role, and the play "Xuan Yuan Rong" was his specialty, which no one else could perform. His "Visiting Mother" can also form its own school. His singing tone is completely a serious Wang Mao old male role, with calm pronunciation and stable pronunciation. It has become a clumsy singing style, which is even less popular than the Wang and Sun schools. He is a backward person in the times, so no one learns Xu's "Visiting Mother" anymore.</p>

<p>Chapter 13: Attempting to Remedy (113)</p>
<p>Zhu Qi said: "She said I was already dead, which shows that she has no feelings for me in her heart. Although I followed your advice and knelt to beg when I entered the door, she may not understand. I think she has already made this decision, and we have nothing to worry about. I want to tell my parents about the divorce and break away from her openly and honestly. In the future, we can proceed together according to the purpose of two years ago, and my father and mother will definitely approve." Yun Xiang shook her head and said, "No! If this matter is handled according to your words, then I will be laughed at and scolded for the rest of my life. At that time, you and Feng Sheng divorced privately, and I was the one who advocated it for her. Now we want to get married. In Feng Sheng's eyes, what kind of person have I become? As far as your family is concerned, your parents will definitely not approve. As for me personally, I have no such hope, because everyone is for the sake of feelings. If a grain of sand is mixed into the feelings, the spiritual state will always be uncomfortable." Zhu Qi said: "What sand? I don't understand!" Yun Xiang said painfully, "I can't bear to say this out of my mouth." Zhu Qi said: "According to what you said, there is no hope!" Yun Xiang said: "Yes, there is no hope!" Zhu Qi said: "Then what is the point of me living? I might as well escape into the empty gate and become a monk!" Yun Xiang said: "You are talking even more nonsense. You have parents above you, and your responsibility is very heavy. How can you say anything about becoming a monk?" Zhu Qi said: "My spirit has no sustenance, and I can't go home. What can I do?" Yun Xiang said: "You should still go home and find your wife. She has a conscience. She was angry with you last night, maybe because you were too reckless. Try going again today." Zhu Qi said: "No! I can't go! She said I was already dead. How can I have the face to see her?" Yun Xiang said: "You are too angry! You have to think that you have let her down. No wonder she is angry. You have to talk to her well." Zhu Qi said: "You don't know her temper. No matter what you say to her, it's useless!" Yun Xiang said: "Logically, I should go and explain to her, but unfortunately I am sick now and can't go out." Zhu Qi said: "I don't think there is any need to do this. Let's discuss our own affairs. You know that I have no feelings for Feng Sheng. Now, even if we force ourselves to get along, there will be no good results in the future." Yun Xiang said: "This is your one-sided thinking. Feng Sheng married you and has not complained that you are not good. Let alone you still have the ability to support her now, even if you are so poor that you have nothing, and she follows you to beg for food, she will not complain about you. Why do you hate such a virtuous woman?" Zhu Qi said: "Your argument is different from before. You used to sympathize with me very much. Why are you biased towards her now?"</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Seeing the flowering peach blossoms, I suddenly have thoughts</p>
<p>The grass in front of the building is messy and uneven, my heart is silent and birds are chirping, the peach blossoms shine on the fan and become a new score, the wandering bandits breed spring and remember the late Ming; I sigh that there is no clean land in sight, and there is only melancholy in the world! Asking heaven what plan to save the precarious situation? Wash away the chaos in my heart and liver.</p>
<p>Drinking with Sanmu Baijiao at night</p>
<p>Thinly entrusting life and death to the secluded orchid, it is difficult to live in seclusion in the mountains and rocks, tonight's faint lamp is also a pure blessing, a pot is not the sea but has back eddies. If the land sinks and the thousands of halberds cease, the old man should divide the rest of his writing ink. How many officials laughed at their fingertips, measuring their waists can recognize the exhaustion of the common people?</p>
<p>Falling Plum Blossoms</p>
<p>I dreamed that loyal souls came to roll call, and I woke up to mourn the flowers even more. Heaven ultimately pities the strong and unyielding, and a ground of spring ice buries the falling plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Meeting the seal maker Han Dongan</p>
<p>A dragon and snake are in his wrist, and my heart is still not tamed. The atmosphere of heaven and earth is at the tip of the knife, and the dust of the road is on my hair. The lamps are destroyed in the chaos, and the sorrows are different from those of people in other worlds. How many dreams are there in the city building, and if the inscription can bring back spring!</p>
<h3 id="e174">Suicide in America <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Every half hour, someone commits suicide in America. During the war, the suicide rate was relatively low, perhaps because jobs were easy to find, and everyone was busy and had little opportunity for contemplation and silence. However, when the economy is depressed, more people seek death. In 1929, when the American stock market crashed, a "joke" circulated: There was a tall hotel, and whenever guests came to rent a room, the waiter would carefully ask: "Sir, are you renting the room to sleep in, or to jump off the building?"</p>
<p>Of the 100,000 suicide attempts that occur in the United States each year, 20,000 protagonists succeed. Most of them arise from sudden impulses, usually in panic. Some doctors say that one-third of the suicides are either mentally deranged, drunk, or sick. However, generally speaking, 80 percent of American suicides are due to emotional or financial troubles. But the financial motives are complex—more people commit suicide because they have too little money than because they have no money at all. Apparently, Americans can endure real poverty, but find it difficult to endure the fear of poverty.</p>
<p>Someone asked: Is there a more comfortable method of suicide than jumping off a building? - Why is jumping off a building one of the most common methods of suicide? The following example can give us an explanation:</p>
<p>Several years ago, a young man named John Ward secretly climbed up the narrow window of the seventeenth floor of a hotel in New York. His sister frantically begged him to climb back, but he ignored her, so she called the police. However, they could not catch Ward, could not pull him back, and were afraid that pressing him too hard would force him to jump down. Ward's sister and the police painstakingly persuaded him to climb back, but not only did he not listen, he also talked nonsense to them and even made fun of them. After a stalemate for several hours, Ward finally jumped from the seventeenth floor in full view of everyone, ending his life. This fully demonstrates extreme "exhibitionism" (Exhibitionism), which is what is called "dying to show off."</p>
<p>Three times more men commit suicide than women. Men take more drastic measures, such as shooting and hanging. As for women, when preparing to end their lives, it is as if there is a convention among them. They rarely use methods that would destroy their appearance. They seem to "care about face even in death."</p>
<p>Most state laws in the United States consider attempted suicide to be a crime. In New York State, helping and abetting suicide is first-degree murder, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Americans have organized many suicide prevention associations. According to their experience, strangers are more effective at counseling world-weary people than acquaintances. They have also found that if they delay the suicidal thoughts of world-weary people for a few days, or even a few hours, most of them will disappear and they will decide to live - suicidal attempts are nineteen out of ten times a temporary impulse. The impulse is temporary. Once it disappears, even if the person who attempted suicide is forced to seek death again, he will shrink back.</p>

<p>— Shu Lin</p>
<p>Take off your long overcoat, run out of the stuffy house filled with turbid air, go to the countryside, and throw yourself into the embrace of spring!</p>
<p>Let us bathe in this bright spring light, washing away all the mildew that has grown up in the gloomy winter; let us also temporarily close the books with black words on white paper, and open another kind of living, wordless reading material.</p>
<p>See the hundreds of trees wearing new clothes, the weeping willows swaying in the breeze, the willow branches gently stroking the water surface; all over the mountains and fields are red flowers and green grass. What a beautiful picture this is! Those who practice calligraphy, why not bring your writing tools to describe it and ask it for advice?</p>
<p>Listen, the birds on the branches are playing the Spring Welcome Song. Who can say that there are no beautiful melodies in its song?</p>
<p>Don't close your eyes. We look at birds, beasts, and reptiles. What are their shapes and habits? How do they live? How do plants germinate, grow, and bud and bloom?</p>
<p>Pick up a piece of wood or a honeycomb and carefully observe its structure. You will discover many strange things, enough to make you write several pages of text.</p>
<p>Nature is the best school, and no other school has as many and as broad subjects as it does. We can get a lot of knowledge from this school that cannot be found in books.</p>
<p>Spring is the time of year when the school has the most knowledge. Even the least thoughtful person can get a lot of valuable knowledge and life inspiration in this vigorous spring, as long as he is willing to contact nature and open his eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Changing Surnames and Names <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Lei Xue Tu</p>
<p>In the summer of 1945, Germany completely collapsed, and the entire territory came under the control of the Allied forces. Hitler's whereabouts were unknown. Some said he committed suicide and his body could not be identified, some said he fled to Argentina, and some said he fled to the East. The situation was confusing, and the Allied forces' search and arrest were naturally the right thing to do. Afterwards, it was reported in Europe that Hitler's brother submitted a request to the Allied authorities, stating that he would change his surname to "Hiler" to avoid harassment and avoid being implicated. This incident is laughable, but it is an interesting interlude in a thrilling martial arts drama.</p>
<p>"Hitler" (希特勒) can be changed to "Hiler" (希勒) by simply removing the letter T, and the sound of the surname will be completely different. Unless he himself has committed any crimes, he will not suffer the hardship of being arrested instead of his brother. This kind of situation, if compared with Chinese examples, is slightly the same in the principle of changing names to avoid suspicion and staying away from disaster, but the method is different.</p>
<p>According to "Hitler," (希特勒) it is the surname. His name is "Adolph," so although he is usually called Hitler, he must write his full name on formal documents (such as the declaration of war against the Soviet Union), Adolph Hitler. His brother's name is "Aloys Hitler" (阿鲁士希特勒). Since they do not have the same name, there is no need to change the surname. If this Brother Hitler is also a war criminal, then he himself is qualified to be arrested and punished, so what is the use of changing the surname? Since he openly applied to change his surname, it means that the Allied forces did not consider him a war criminal, and he himself had no doubts or fears. It can be seen that his application to change his surname was completely affected by his brother.</p>
<p>In China, there are people who change their names to avoid suspicion, but it is rare to change their surnames, and there is no need to do so. For example, Wang Zhaoming, Wang Shijing, both have the surname "Wang," and both are "traitors." However, Shijing's arrest and conviction were not because of the surname "Wang," nor was he implicated by Zhaoming, but because of his own crimes. If Zhaoming's brothers had not been traitors, they would be innocent people, and their names would have no problem at all. But if another person also had the surname "Wang" and was also named "Zhaoming," then he would definitely be uneasy. Although Zhaoming does not have the mystery of life and death like Hitler, this "another Wang Zhaoming" would definitely "change his name" automatically to avoid stimulation, but he would never "change his surname." As for "Aloys Hitler's" changing his surname, it is indeed of great use to avoid implication. The reason lies in the fundamental difference in the principle of pronunciation of Chinese and Western people's names.</p>
<p>Hitler is usually only called Hitler, and his "Adolph" is rarely used. His brother is also usually only called "Hitler," and his "Aloys" is also something in the cold palace. Therefore, as long as there is a call to "Search for Hitler!" then this Brother Hitler can be "pulled and dragged to the court" (a line from the opera "Yu Tang Chun"). Rather than declaring "Aloys" after arriving at the court, it is better to remove a letter from "Hitler" as soon as possible and change it to "Hiler," which can save a lot of trouble. If a Chinese person is a traitor, unless he has the same name, those with the same surname can rest assured. Chinese people often call names and titles, not just the surname. Even if a group of classmates live together all day long, they must add words such as "Lao" (old) or "Xiao" (young) to the surname to make up two syllables in one breath. For example, "Lao Zhang, Lao Li, Xiao Wang, Xiao Wang" also need to add "Lao" and "Xiao" to the surname to make up two syllables in one breath. "Hitler" (希特) has two syllables in one word, so those with the same name are prone to suspicion. Therefore, it is customary to use the "surname" as a general term. The reason for using the surname as a general term is the same as the principle of calling the name in Chinese (limited by the acoustic law).</p>
<p>During the Chinese imperial era, it was customary to "respect and omit the last stroke" of the emperor's "given name" (御名). For example, the "yi" (儀) in "Puyi" (溥儀) must omit the last stroke under "yi" (義). (Many books printed during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty still exist, and all of them are missing a stroke when encountering this.) For example, in Qianlong's "Hongli" (弘曆), the dot at the end of "Hong" (弘) must be changed, and the "he" (禾) in "li" (暦) must be changed to "mu" (木), always using "iron pen" as the usual practice (rewriting is also common). The missing strokes in Chinese characters are only a difference in form and have nothing to do with the sound. Western characters are phonetic characters, so reducing the letters will greatly change the sound. However, it also depends on what kind of letters they are and what position they are in. For example, it is correct to change Hitler to Hiler by removing the "te" (特). Even if Himmler (Hmmler) removes one M, it is still "Himmler" (希姆勒). You must remove two Ms to get another "Hiler" (希勒). (Himmler was Hitler's secret police chief and his most trusted confidant, the guy who was arrested after the war and committed suicide by swallowing poison.)</p>
<p>In the past, official documents in China often added strokes to the names of bandits and other criminals to avoid implicating good people. For example, when the Guangdong Governor during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty reported on the bandit "Luo Guo Zhang" (羅幗章), the "jin" (巾) radical of "Guo" (幗) was added by the official, because the name "Guo Zhang" (國章) was very common. If the criminal was not arrested, those with the same name would inevitably be implicated and blackmailed. Even if the criminal has been arrested and punished, those with the same name will inevitably feel unlucky and disgusted, and distant relatives and friends will be spared misunderstandings and suspicions. Therefore, adding strokes to make it a rare word can avoid this problem. For example, the "grass head" is added to the "yi" in "Zhu Yi Ren" (朱苡仁) in the Shandong sea ship robbery case, the "Zhou Chang Lü" (周萇綠) in the Zhejiang criminal case, and the "Zhang Tong Wen" (張恫文) in the Shaanxi robbery case. The cold words in the middle of their names can be seen at a glance as added strokes. The reduction of strokes in the "given name" is "respect and avoidance," while the addition of strokes in the bandit's name is to avoid implication.</p>
<p>In ancient China, there were occasionally cases of changing surnames to avoid disaster. For example, Zhang Hui of Changzhou. . Hanlin Zuo Wenlin Lang Yun Jun presented a memorial saying: "Yun's original surname was Yang, and Yun, the Marquis of Pingtong in the Han Dynasty, his son violated the disaster and took his father's name as his surname, which is called Zhen Dao, who was the Liang Xiang and later moved to Huangshan in Piling and was buried there. His descendants were Piling people for generations." According to Yang Yun in the Han Dynasty, whose name was Ziyou, he was tried for writing a letter to Sun Huizong with angry words. At that time, the penalties were barbaric, and "extermination of the clan" and "implication" were often used. His descendants did not dare to have the surname "Yang" and took his name as their surname. The Yun surname in Changzhou is still a large clan today, and there were many Hanlin members from the Yun family in the Qing Dynasty. Also, before the July 7th Incident, the older brother of Sheng Baotang, the chief writer of the Beiping Chenbao, talked about the origin of his surname. It was originally the descendant of General Nian Gengyao of the Qing Dynasty. General Nian was jealous of Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty. After being given suicide, his descendants were afraid, so they reduced the strokes of the word "Nian" (年) to "Sheng" (生). This is not exactly the same as the example of reducing the letters of "Hitler," but it is also enough to provide materials for mutual reference. Therefore, they are recorded together by category.</p>

<p>Mutual Assistance Among Classmates Averts Dropping Out of School</p>
<p>To the Gentlemen of the Social Services Department: On March 8th, I received your letter and learned that you could specially arrange for a grant to prevent me from dropping out of university, for which I am truly grateful! On February 29th, I went to a classmate's home and talked about the possibility of having to drop out this semester. My classmates were all in tears and didn't want to part with me. Later, classmate Xue Fuxing said, "We should all think of a way to help classmate Lu." On March 1st, five classmates came to my home and surprisingly decided on a kind of "charity association" method, raising exactly two million yuan. The participating classmates are Xue Fuxing, Kang Xiumei, Xu Jingen, Sun Qigang, and Chen Yongxing. In addition, my father borrowed 500,000 yuan from the neighbors, and I managed to scrape together 300,000 yuan myself, so my studies have been secured. I won't need to apply for a grant this semester. Thank you to the gentlemen of your newspaper. As for my father's rheumatism, firstly, the weather has warmed up, and his condition is somewhat better; secondly, Shanghai County is currently dredging the river, and the township, bao, jia, and chiefs are all extremely busy. To apply for relief, it would be somewhat difficult at the moment to find them to affix their seals of approval. I am very grateful for the newspaper's kindness. I will work twice as hard in all subjects, as instructed in your letter. I respectfully wish you all the best. Student, Lu Binxiang, respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Seeking Chinese Friends <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir: Thanks to the introduction in your newspaper's "Social Services" column, a friend of mine received seventeen letters from China in two months, in other words, he gained seventeen Chinese friends.</p>
<p>Like my friend, I have always loved and admired China, with its beautiful scenery, ancient culture, and beloved people.</p>
<p>I also hope to use a corner of your newspaper to seek a few Chinese friends and correspond with them regularly. I am twenty-nine years old, an Australian soldier currently serving in northern New Guinea. I love literature, music, gardening, painting, and stamp collecting. My mailing address is Crow's Nest, Queensland, Australia. Respectfully, H. W. Miller.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Postal Q&amp;A <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Our Bureau has received inquiries from (1) Mr. Zong of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, (2) Mr. Jiang Hanbing of Zhongzheng South Road, (3) The New Youth Society of Shanghai, and (4) Mr. Sun Zuoting of Cai Tongde Pharmacy. We hereby provide brief answers to the various points raised:</p>
<p>(Answers) (1) (A) Remittances are not available to Zhouwangmiao Town. Remittances can be sent to the nearby Chang'an or Xieqiao post offices. (B) If parcels contain American goods, an import permit must be prepared for customs inspection; otherwise, import duties must be paid.</p>
<p>(2) Surface mail from Shanghai to Java is either shipped directly to Surabaya for transfer or carried to Singapore or Hong Kong for transit. Currently, there is no fixed shipping schedule. These items are dispatched once or twice a week, taking approximately three weeks to arrive.</p>
<p>(3) If mail that should be posted in a specific delivery zone is directly submitted to the sub-bureau of that delivery zone, it can be delivered directly by the sub-bureau without being transferred by the Management Bureau.</p>
<p>(4) (A) Local mail in Shanghai can be delivered on the same day if it is submitted to a designated sub-bureau or dropped into a rush-hour mailbox. The North Station Sub-bureau is a designated sub-bureau, and there are three rush-hour mailboxes on North Henan Road. (B) Mailboxes installed at agency offices and consignment points are not rush-hour mailboxes. (C) For mail sent to post office boxes, it is only necessary to indicate the box number, and there is no need to indicate the district number. (D) Each sub-bureau delivers mail four times a day, and three times on Sundays. (E) The opening time of the mailbox is the same as the post office's collection time. (F) Regarding publications on postal knowledge, there is the Modern Postal Monthly, published by the Modern Postal Monthly Society of the Postal General Administration. Chinese Cultural Service Societies and major bookstores throughout the country sell it for 10,000 yuan per copy, 50,000 yuan for six issues every six months. Post offices throughout the country also sell it and can arrange subscriptions.</p>
