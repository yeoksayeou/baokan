<h3 id="c17">經濟病況不容再拖！ <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>這幾天的市面，說得好些，彷彿在過除夕，過元旦；說得急些，一般人都覺得生活必需品的購買受了缺貨的威脅。當然人民也知道政府所說「並不缺貨一是並非欺騙，然而照限價買不到貨，却是事實。買不到米，買不到油，買不到柴炭煤球，買不到魚肉蔬菜，政府表面是限價，市場實際是黑市！這種異乎尋常的情况，政府自然不能不趕緊籌劃，人民更不能不急盼解決。局勢至此，斷非再拖所能有濟？</p>
<p>因此，翁院長急了，王財長也急了，於是在本月十八日立法院中的秘密檢討會議中，翁院長分析了造成「反常」情形的原因，王財長更提出了四項補救辦法。二十一日翁院長召集中樞經管要員開會而意見迄未一致：二十三日翁院長由京飛平，請示於總統，二十四日徵詢北平各大學敎授專家意見；二十五日翁院長飛返首都，北平各敎授發表他們的「爲民請命書」；二十六日，立法院决議根絕搶購案，向行政院提質詢，監察院則决議向行政院學糾正案；二十七日，翁院長召集各區經管督導員研討經濟改革補充辦法，尙無結果。據聞，卽使今天繼續商討有若干結果，還要等候國民黨中央政治會議的討論通過，然後再提付行政院的政務會議來作决定。如此這般，這個迫切的問題，勢非再拖兩三天不可；然而，「拖」畢竟是並不能解決問題的！</p>
<p>經濟局勢的「反常」就是經濟的病症。而這種病症，是由經濟斷流開其端，搶購貨物收其果。二十天以前，搶購之風開始；到現在搶購之風在上海似乎已歛，而實則所必需者幾似無貨可購，何從去搶？如果請了一位只看表面病象的醫生，或許誤認此時病已好轉，其實伏邪內陷，非下瞑眩之藥，深恐「厥疾弗瘳」。北平各大學敎授的「爲民請命書」，雖未必是十全十美的良方，至少是一劑根擄了脈案所開的湯藥，不致完全藥不對症。夭抵中樞所研討的，當亦大體不外乎此。可惜，這種藥方已經稍嫌貢獻遲了一些；或者從前縱也有獻議的人，只緣並非故都名醫，不爲當局所重，坐令經濟病况乃有逐漸轉入膏肓之勢。但是到了今天，我們敬謹奉勸政府當局，千萬不可再諱疾忌醫，把這嚴重的經濟病體依然拖延下去。</p>
<p>千言萬語，姑且併作一句：政府必須負責使持有金圓券的善良平民能够買到其所必需的主要生活品。要辦到這一點，首先當從「貨暢其流」做起；而要「貨暢其流」，必須澈上澈下，澈始澈終，把一切人爲的足以阻塞貨物交流的病根一槪剷除。近來常常聽到當局大聲疾呼，鼓勵各地的物資相互交換，可見他們也知道貨物交流的重要，「經濟斷流」的危險。殊不知所以造成今日貨不暢流的病態者，其責就在政府本身。若不從這病根上想法，反而枝節節要用「物物交換」辦法去促其交流，眞如如孟子所說「何許子之不憚煩？」故醫治今日經濟重病的第一步，端在拔除那政府所築用以阻塞貨物交流的堤壩——步步關卡，處處檢査的堤壩！這個堤壩早已超出了取締囤積居奇辦法所需要的檢査範圍了！</p>
<p>其次，我們可以言限價與議價。在今天，上海是限價，有許多地方已是議價。限價的上海買不到必需品，讀價的成都貨品已漸充斥，取消限價而改爲議價的天津物價反而漸跌；這說明了什麽？現在彷彿一談議價、就是破壞了限價，違反了「八一九」的緊急措施令：其實不然。相反地，只知表而限價而事實上　難限住，眼開眼閉放任黑市的猖狂，或者置人民不能買到其主要生活品於不顧，這纔是摧毀了限價。「八一九」命令所附發的加强管制經濟辦法第十三條固然規定了八一九的　合價但其第十四條明明規定一其有特殊原因者，非經主管官署核准，不得加價」，可見凡有特殊原因而請求調整其價格者，主管管署理應加以考慮，准其爲合理之調整。惟其能許作合理之議價，始能有合理之限價；議價與限價似相反而實相成。何况要嚴格限價就要全國一律限，斷不能此限而彼不限，甲限而乙不限的。總之，現在已到了政府必須負責解救經濟危機的時候了，切盼勿再爭執這些「限價」「議價」的名詞，而必須求得「貨暢其流」的有效良方。</p>

<p>起訴事實</p>
<p>美專學生李凌雲·盧漢華·陳力萍·吳樹之，劉鳴（女）等五人起訴書：「緣本年六月五日本市有一部分學生，假借反對美國扶植日本爲名，集體遊行，是日中午上海美專學校自治會部分學生，亦有遊行之準備，爲該校另一部分學生听阻，因而發生爭毆，李凌雲·盧漢華·陳力萍·吳樹之·劉鳴均受傷，經送警察醫院療治，當治療期間，復秘密與該校在外探望學生以紙條通信，警局搜獲後，認其內容顯有反動組織之分子，遂將被告等解送偵辦到庭。據各被吿等供述對於「反美扶日」詳情，雖諉稱不知，但査李凌雲先後與慮漢華·陳力萍寫紙條，裝於火柴盒內，擲出馬路，給美專鄭鈺等同學，措詞激烈，核閱內容，顯示被吿等此次「反美扶日」遊行，確爲有組織有計劃之行動。又吳樹之身畔搜獲致霄寒（卽劉嗚）未發之信兩封，對劉一週之工作，甚表質佩，並說及四日到交大之事，庭訊時亦供認四日下午確到交大學生自治會連絡，劉鳴爲帮助剪貼報紙漫畫事甚忙云云。又查獲中華職業學生自治會寄給美專各受傷學生函中載有「你們參加反美扶日大會被打，心中感到憤恨，你們美專同學要做一個引火者，我們永遠跟着你走向着明天進軍，確借我們要勝利」云云。此外並機獲類似之函多件。均足證明各被吿等參加共匪活動。復査學生遊行時，警局在外灘截獲共匪宣傳品中，內有一件，列舉反動口號病灶載列「中共西北中央局慶祝光復延安之通告」，則此次反美扶日遊行，散發傳單，爲共匪所策動，面爲之宣傳，極爲明顯。被吿等旣係事前犯意聯絡，縱因臨時爲校內同學所阻，不及參加但仍不能不負共同責任。該李凌雲等均有違反戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例第二條第一項及刑法第十一條廿第八條之罪嫌，依法提起公訴。」</p>
<p>另一案起訴之施宗江，周勁永，陶定國，朱培根，等四被吿，其起訴事實：施爲復旦大學共匪情報負責人，調査我方學生活動，參加各次學潮周係暨南大學學生，參加學聯，策動學潮，陶係同濟大學學生，參加奸匪組織。朱乃東吳大學學生，爲該校奸黨中堅份子，負責學生報接頭印刷及宣傳等任務，係朱學範之子。　其　餘因犯罪證據不足，不予起訴者十五人：劉宗俊，黄光潮，趙子韓，顧克儉，秦益銘，（以上復且），査鴻寳（女），陳馥衡，陳定平，張世榮，駱家騏（以上東吳），王綱俊（滬江），沙鍼（女）（同濟），吳元正（南通學院），徐益（民治新專），王榮寳（永安公司職員）。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>（浙省主席陳公洽氏，有巡視湖屬之行，記者同往，該處山水秀麗，物產豐饒，如能再加改進，前途米可限量，爰爲文記之。）</p>
<p>從杭州循運河北行，兩岸阡陌速锦，桑槐成林，遠處山林起伏，河道縱績，港　分歧，菱塘，魚　，處處皆是，這裏也是水鄕，但與　屬略有不同，嘉勝者平原一片，此處還有丘陵山地。</p>
<p>汽船走二小時許，折入德淸縣境，三小時後到達德淸城。德淸在抗戰時期，曾兩度淪入敵手，縣城附近山　屛陣，水路橫貫城境，可去杭縣的塘棲，吳興的菱湖，嘉與的新　，桐鄕的烏鎭，祟德的石門灣，四通八達，縣民多以舟楫作爲唯一的交通工具。城內房屋整齊，人民衣着也很淸潔，抗戰前德淸縣擁有十七萬人口，戰後只有十四萬人口了。</p>
<p>縣產絲繭，魚，菱，羊毛等，米產量不多，供給縣內尙嫌不足。絲繭今年產量五千担，秋繭收穫甚豐，售價也很好，每担可得一百二三十元，照限價也可購得六七祖米糧。此地的魚，是淡水魚，年產約一萬担，運銷上海等地，今年因爲雨水較多，河流激漲，所以收穫不如理想之好。菱也是特產之一，運滬可作菱粉等用處，今年產量特多，賣不起價錢。羊毛年產約千祖，運銷上海後再轉運出國，原地售出每担價約一百元。</p>
<p>一般講來，德淸縣的經濟情形不算太壞。不過自從政府實施限價以來，也有搶購的風潮，商店內的貨物都藏匿了起來，猪肉買不到，米也難得買得着，遝醬園內的醬瓜之類也沒有出售了。</p>
<p>由德淸去菱湖，汽舟行兩小時卽達，這是正在欣欣向榮的地方，當地亦出絲繭，菱與魚蝦，產量相當豐富。</p>
<p>從菱湖到吳興縣城，汽船也要走兩小時，沿途菱塘連亙不斷，很多菱桶，載着年靑的姑娘，划向菱葉的深處，採擷新鮮的菱角。</p>
<p>吳興縣城內的精華之處，多以水門汀舖成馬路，兩旁店舖很整齊，看起來也很殷實，縣治有人民十一萬多，全縣人口有五十六萬人，這裏盛產絲繭，年有十五萬担，綢廠很多，零機織戶也很多。當地有報紙兩家，一爲湖報，一爲商報，湖報日銷八百份，商報稍少於湖報的銷路。</p>
<p>吳興除產絲綢外，另也產菱與魚蝦，羊毛之類。另外還有一種毛筆，也是名產，凡是用毛筆寫中國字的人，莫不知道「湖筆」的盛名，湖筆之優點，在不脫毛，製法甚爲考究，他最遠的銷區，要到哈爾濱，不過馳名的「湖筆」，也不是湖州縣內所產的，它是出生在德淸縣的善璉鎭上，那裏很多人家都以製筆爲生，抗戰時期，敵人在善璉鎮上投了炸彈，把製筆的人趕往外地，大半都選到蘇州，現在的產量已不如以前多了。</p>
<p>吳興一位人士對我說：「吳興縣是山的盡頭，水的起頭」。所謂山的盡頭，是指天目山脈的落脚處，水的起頭，是苕溪的開始，也是正當太湖流城的邊綠上，如果我們形容起來，吳興甚至湖屬，可謂是兼有山水之勝的，可惜許多山巒沒有廣植林木，許多河道也沒有注意到疏濬的工作，如果山上植林，河道疏濬，則今年的魚汛，應該是很好的了，而且河道疏溶以後，再把菱秧加以改良播植，則所產的菱，也一定要肥大質美。</p>
<p>湖屬氣候溫和，適於牧羊，此間羊毛已行銷國外，如果再把羊吃的草加以研究改良，再把羊的住處牧地加以淸潔合理，則羊毛一項，可以爭回很多的外匯。</p>
<p>現在因爲限價關係，所以湖屬的物資大半凍結，卽就魚一項來說，許多人沒有從魚塘裏捕魚運滬銷售，這樣，會影響今後的生產的。</p>
<p>湖屬治安情形很好，一年餘來，盜竊的案件幾乎成了例外，我想在這安定的環境中，湖屬的人民對於自家的生產事業，應該設法改進！</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　韓淸濤</p>
<p>苦難中的藩陽，在艱困中掙扎，在凄凉中求生，看起來還很硬朋，起勁！</p>
<p>雖然人口由二百萬减到了八十dg　萬，雖然商店多半關了門，歇了業，雖然人們吃來麵的少，吃豆渣糠皮的多,但社會反倒變成單純，變成穩定。</p>
<p>潘陽第一個嚴重問題是糧荒，因爲糧食沒有來源，空中的運職，究竟是有限的，那怎能担負八十多萬人口吃，五六個大軍用——當然軍糧僅是一部份。</p>
<p>災和難，似乎是不能分開的，在今年春末夏初的當兒，潘陽有靑黄不接的難關，緊接着來的是夏末秋初的空前蚜虫災害，災和難幾乎離不開藩陽。</p>
<p>軍政當局對於潘陽這個生死關頭，很重視，很焦慮，省市首長更對這費盡了心血，把整個的精力，用在了「糧食問題」上。</p>
<p>董文琦市長對記者說：「我二次回到市政府，在施政上是糧食第一，其他工作其次！」</p>
<p>不錯，他解決了潘陽今春靑黄不接時候的糧食危機，他現在更大聲疾呼的推行市民儲糧運動，他笑着說：「人家反對囤積，我在提倡變象的囤積！」</p>
<p>當然，他這個儲糧運動，似在獎勵市民囤積，但，大家沒忘記潘陽情形特殊吧！糧食來源困難吧！他這個儲糧運動，正是針對現實，在解決大問題。</p>
<p>他計劃的目標和辦法是：「每家工廠最低限度要存自用食糧在三個月以上，各礦廠要赴外縣購糧，或委託糧商以及市府民食調配委員會代購，另組萬人購糧隊，無息貸款，每人金圓一百五十元，半月償還」</p>
<p>爲了把握災餘新糧登塲時機，工礦汽車，商人馬車，市民推車，脚踏車，以及背着蔴袋的購糧隊伍，出現在遼中，新民，法庫，鐵嶺，遼陽，撫順的小道和大路上，偉大的行列，發揮無窮力量。</p>
<p>儲糧運動順利的進行着，藩陽市面上的糧價，每天往下跌，游資又都運用在糧食上，這樣不但解決了潘陽大部份的糧荒，同時也免除了被彼及上京，滬，平，津搶購物質的浪潮</p>
<p>四鄉的老百姓，雖然糧食勉强維持一飽，但他們所缺的是布和其他日用品，這回購糧隊伍，得到了允許，拿布疋和其他日用品去換糧，因而雙方都大有裨益，所以收效至大。</p>
<p>過去，潘陽周邊的層層卡哨，給物資交流上很大的阻碍，一般人說：「怕流進匪區的金銀和紗布，似乎是並沒减少，一兩月來以紗布間接換取遼南匪方貿易局的蘋菓，就是一個例子」。</p>
<p>衛總司令對於董市長的儲糧運動很贊賞，除了接受了董市長請求免除卡哨對購糧隊的限制建議外，並代想出了藩市營業汽車最少出外拉糧十次，方得在市內營業的辦法。</p>
<p>近日，藩陽軍政要員不斷下鄉，督導糧食集中，潘陽市又在推行儲糧運動，只要潘陽不倒下去，東北一切都有辦法，加以東北局勢開展，遠景正好，希望無窮。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕現棉交易沉寂已久，國棉聯購處雖極力設法，以成品掉換收購，但前途困難甚多，各種枝節不易剔除。本市各棉商在滬存貨，業與聯購會數度接洽，惟因聯購會對收購棉花掉換成品，尙未有具體決定，故均觀望。又棉商在外埠存貨，亦將俟掉換比率確定後，在當地脫售，而以掉得之成品再向產地購棉云。</p>
<p>又訊：自經濟管制實施以來，已兩月有零，本埠紗布，出境因受限制，供應稀少，各地農村需要布疋，十分枯竭。據棉業界息：本年新棉上市，各地不見棉花出售，綠鄉民鋻於田問起來之花，出售須照限價，而所需要之日用品如布疋肥皂肥料等類，在鄉間照限價亦無法買到，故新棉不願出售，一部份則改紡土紗，以土紗織十襪土布。聞棉產接近地區若千縣市土紗機布頗多應市，而農村手工業則利市十倍云。</p>
<p>又訊：行頃撥出棉紗萬餘件，運赴各產棉區，以成本換取棉花，所訂詳細辦法，業由國行劉副總裁携帶赴京，呈請當局核示，一經核准，卽可公佈起運。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕日來南北市塲到米，每日每處不過千石，尙未見大量湧到。惟搌米商方面觀測，當局撥供易米之布疋四種，刻已分配竣事，各同業當可分別向產區進行物物交換，購米困難當可解除不少。又按往例，重陽以後，新米卽陸續登塲，茲適當新米旺季，預料以布易米後，下月十日前後，食米當可大量湧到。又據悉：近來各地購米時，留難及扣壓斤量情形已較好轉，遠地辦米，如江西安徽等地，因車皮欠缺，到歡有限。聞當局爲解決購米困難計，第二批實物易米，將以肥皂食糖等農村日用品，撥交各米商易米云。</p>
<p>又訊：食米昨到貨益稀，因產地來貨少，採購不易，且若干產雀不肯放行，但以布易米辦法，開始實行，預料同業採購更踴躍，到貨卽可增加。昨日南市塲所到共六七六石，北市共到三三五石，二市塲合計一千〇十一石。</p>

<p>工業會審査完竣</p>
<p>工業會技術委員會昨繼續發表五金鋁器二工業，目前原料困難，急需解決辦法如下：</p>
<p>（甲）五金工業　該業製品繁雄，故所需原料種類較多。各種生要原料目前極感缺乏者，如黄鋼銅皮銅梗絲燐鋼絲洋元惠司鐵生鐵鐵板鐵及盤元廢彈売鋁錠膠木粉鎳紗帶棉綫等項，以往均向各行號廠商採購，亦有自國外輸八，如鋁鉛則由台灣採購。唯最近以來，市上各原料幾全部停止供應，無從搜購，其中亦有少數原料，如銅皮前係向銅錫業採辦，現需以廢銅皮及銅角交換。紗帶以前係向織帶業採購，而現在須以紗綫掉換。然在此原料極形缺乏時，此種舊料及交換品，亦無法購得，故該榮原料一項，可謂完全斷絕。又其中燐銅絲與鎳，市上早已絕跡，長此以往，前途實不堪設想，宜從速予以解決，以圖發展，使其成品能得源源應市。急救辦法，由物調會轉令銅工業鋼鐵工業織帶工業及五金業銅銀業鐵業等公會，分別依各廠實際需要之各項原料源源供應</p>
<p>（乙）鋁器工業　本業所需之主要原料爲鋁錠，其困難情形如後，（一）外匯配給有限，且較第四季减少，（二）台灣鋁錠未能儘量供應，自八一九以來98％鋁錠，迄未售出。解決辦法除請輪管會放寬限額外，應請台　鋁錠盡量裝運來滬，以資供應云。</p>

<h3 id="c148">錯誤的心理 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>在當局屬行節約聲中所反映的事實是：酒樓戯院的特殊繁榮——到處客滿，到處天天客滿！</p>
<p>據有關方面統計，九月份的筵席娛樂稅收，平均爲三十萬金圓；本月份至十日止已達二十萬金圓，預計本月收入當在百萬金圓以上云云。從稅收方面說，這是一種好現象。但從人們爲什麼要如此瘋狂的享樂來着想，這情形却又是極其可怕的。</p>
<p>卽如最近蔓延各地的搶購之一風，有人認爲是黄牛黨的作祟，這固不能說爲毫無理由。但黄牛黨的作祟只不過是若干原因中之一，其主要原因，還是大多數人們心理的錯誤。</p>
<p>這錯誤心理的形成，以筆者粗淺的看來：第一，當然是自私心理的作怪，其起因則由於烟稅的增加。因爲烟稅的增加，使烟商憑空獲致了倍蓗的利益，於是一般商人們便根據烟稅增加的事實，以爲其它貨物也有增價的可能，所以便不願出資存貨，以期博取更大的利益；一般市民當然也根據上述觀點，爲避免重價的剝削計，便又拼命的搶購。雙方的態度旣背道而馳，於是便形成了人爲的求過於供的現象，於是便使多數日用品有價無貨，又於是而構成了若干人們心理的恐慌。</p>
<p>娛樂和筵席稅的突飛猛進，雖沒有上述這種形跡的表現，但也是受這一心理和事實的影響的。例如若干家庭因爲購買食物的不易，於是便索性不買，一日兩餐都「闔第光臨」地作成酒樓；因而在菜市里發現排隊買肉，排隊軋油的盛况，也在若干酒樓飯店裏出現了。這是筵席稅收增加的一個原因。</p>
<p>至於戯院的營業所以鼎盛，我以爲不外是下述兩種人物促成的：其一，是「國家事管他娘」的麻木份子。只要自己衣暖食飽，還有餘資，便儘量享受（使酒樓飯館生意興隆的，這一派也不少），所謂世界大勢，國族前途，當然與他們風馬牛不相及。其二，是沒有眼光，缺乏定力，意態衰頒的悲觀份子，一樁事不如意，一點情形不順眼，便以爲天馬上會塌下來了，於是乎由興奮而頹喪，由積極而消極，由於頽喪和消極，便一味地抱着「今日有酒今日醉」的心理來恣意享樂，而美其名曰：「找尋刺激」，於是一字長蛇又便很自然地成爲戯院的點綴品。這是娛樂稅所以增加的原因。</p>
<p>當然，稅收的增加是可喜的。但這可喜却建立在多數人們矛盾的，錯誤的，消極的心理上，這可喜自又變成可怕了。因爲只要想一想：我們竟不幸擁有這許多麻木分子，頽喪分子，他們對於國家社會，都抱着與自己無關或不可爲的心理，這是何等景象！</p>
<p>貴備商人的不顧道徳，責備市民的眼光短小與自私慾的擴大，在人慾橫流的今日，其結果自然是「聽者藐藐」，不待龜卜的。任其自然嗎？當然又不是辦法。自然，辦法是不會沒有的，而且當局早已訂定了，但其關鍵却在於施行者的是否認眞。我們今日已看到了不少安定物償，疏通資源以及實行節約的種種規定，如果能認眞地執行，當局者更能以身作則，使收「上行下效」之功，則騷亂的局面是會澄淸的。不過，這還是治標。治本的辦法，是如何使我們的下一代不再傳染上這卑鄙，怯懦，自私的心理。一句話：該怎樣敎導我們的下一代。</p>
<p>有人以爲娛樂筵席稅的增加，是厲行節約的一種諷刺，這，只不過是反相之談罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c149">關於朱古微先生 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 美子</p>
<p>朱古微先生在詞學上之成就，及其功績，治文學史者，類能言之。其生平軼事，亦爲人所樂道。顧或展轉稗販，不免以譌傳譌。世有譏彈好談掌故者，謂之「銅話」，以掌故之源，多出京師，不成其爲「金」（諧京），斯則銅耳。</p>
<p>先生書法，早歲與褚河南，爲人所書之砰碣石刻，如餘杭禇君（成博）墓表。婉和凝鍊，純乎登善法乳，拓本至今猶有存之者。消乎晚年，始專力魯公，以「橫平豎直」之旨，求黄山谷之「豐午病右」，趙子固「右方直下」乏說。轉變其素習，乃筆勢偏於右側。彼時頗有效之者，嘗曰：「吾書不足學，學輙病欹，此所謂矯枉過正者也。」相傳先生當光緒癸未（九年），膺殿試時，朝邑問丹初（敬銘），方坊政，其公子亦以是科應試，閱卷官必欲使其中式以媚之。顧無從通關節，第知其學顏體書而不能工，得一卷，以爲在是矣，遽列之第二甲第一名（俗謂之傳臚），比拆彌封，則赫然「朱祖謀」也。此說頗盛傳，而所謂「閤公子」者，則不能舉其名字。證以先生之書法，至晚年始改其舊體（學禇）者，乃知其不確。閻子名酒竹，字君節，一字成叔，亦癸未進士，散館，改禮部主事，官至山西河東道。（朱汝珍詞林輯略）嘗見其乙丑（民國十四年）歲爲盛江劉健之（體乾）題孟蜀石經拓本，不自作書，而命其子孝損代之。孝損書亦習顏法，殊不佳。</p>
<p>或言先生自諱其生日年齒，秘不吿人者，其說亦非，蓋涉某公某事之傳譌。（別一事亦非自諱生日。（先生嘗刻小印，文曰：「先竹垞一月生」（朱竹垞生日爲八月二十一日），常鈐用之·六十生朝時，高野侯（時顯）爲取夢窗詞意，書菊爲壽，題署爲「箱腴圖」，裝成卷子，一時名勝，題詠殆遍，間見於諸家別集。平生於伉儷間，有汪容甫「受詐興公」之恨，迨至臨終絕筆，仍有「眼中犀角，身後牛衣」之句，知其隱痛深矣。以故篤信星命家言。凡有通子平術者，輙就問之，若能斷其「琴瑟不調」，則大樂，引爲知言，因之依草附木之流，略諳詞調，便稱及門，假爲　榜，竟貽笑柄。如曩年詞學季刊補白某術士所作詞話，稱先生於庚子諫用拳匪，觸太后怒，幾爲三忠（袁昶許景澄立山）之續，以身軀短小，從人叢中逸去事，殊堪噴飯，張孟劬（爾田）曾作書痛斥之。</p>
<p>凡上所述，無關宏旨，言之殊覺辭費，第有感於生並世而接其顏色，不二十年已興傳聞異辭之歎，則徵文考獻，寗復可信，掌故而不爲「銅話」者幾希。宋人小說，喜言同時名人遺事，多失其實。乃知古今一體，不足怪也。至於「碧雲　」（宋人小說名）之嫁名梅聖兪，意在攻訐誣蔑元祐黨人者，尤當存而不論矣。</p>

<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>久不出門，偶然乘了一趟極短路程的火車，纔證實了原來近日旅行之風眞地大盛。秋高氣爽，各國人士亦不乏集體遠足遊遊烟霞嚴壑之輩，或且爲覘國者所樂道，只不似我們車內擠成一堆，買頭等票而迫得雙手攀躋在踏脚鐵板上，或縮足危站在兩車鈎連的「詹天佑」上，至於單帮黄牛，簡直對他們無從說起。我們的情况就鄙人所躬歷者郤誠如上述，有的人們遭遇可更苦。如此行脚，以後似乎也應得痛戒。</p>

<p>次晨，我携舍弟在吳苑「聽雨軒」小坐，喫了點心，他忽地內急起來，兩人擲杯起座，倒也無人阻攔，直到街道訊明方便的地方，我在路上等候，約十餘分鐘緣回，茶壺都已重新續滿，木椅猶空，堂倌也不驚訝，這在上海，不當你喫白食還當你什麼。</p>
<p>就是這，那圮舊的破橋，森暗的寂巷，悠悠的閒適，尤其是這點通情達理的人情味，或許會呌我們覺得這地錄還不曾全變做禽獸世界。</p>

<p>平市出售房地等不動產，向有「富富」與「急資」兩種。「富富」者，產業有餘，現款不足，然亦不太窘，雖有意出手，必待善價而沽，有無成交，亦不大在乎。「急資」者，立等錢用（原因是喪葬或其他需要大宗款項之事），故不敢居奇，只期出手。但近來各報此項廣吿攔中，出售房地者漸少，此少數之「急售」者，率有「因主人南遷」字樣。此種情形，含有不同的暗示：（一）有房地者因換來游資，無法安頓，亦轉入「惜售」之類，此售產之所以少也。（在改幣以前，房租按麵袋，而售價則按金條，十間之房，需黄物三十五兩，昌言不諱，而改幣以後·金條爲違禁品，此路不通。）（二）平者急售馭因，爲的是主人南遷，而南遷之原因，則是東北，華北日見緊張之影響。故兩種心理雖相反，而其促成此種心理之總因則又相同，卽「時局」是也。</p>
<p>古老的舊都，常有許多「生意經」的特別名詞，如倚仗房租生活者謂之「吃瓦片」；以字整書籍轉販爲業者，調之「吃軟片」（紙乃軟物也）。前淸時代，平市房產除旗籍府第外，民房主人，大半屬於各部院之書吏，此輩盤據衙門，一切公事上下其手，積蓄甚豐，又多是「老北京」，與官僚之轉歷京外者不同，故有錢則置產，子孫席豐　厚，謂之「吃租兒」，收入優厚而且穩當，確是「吃着不盡」。民國以後，部吏失勢，產權涵形分化。旗下責族府第，大多轉入新財閥軍閥之手。至十七年國都南移，政商各界戶口大减，「瓦片「生活」受極大打擊。至一七七」事變之初，政事　界紛紛避往內地，平市簫條特甚，日人乃大投其機，將空閒房舍或佔或買，又有些依倚敵勢之鮮人華人，大做其「瓦片」謀畫，歡月之後，因戰火遍及外縣村鎭，捎有資者羣集都市，敵僑及鮮人又紛至沓來，造成一種龐大之「假繁榮」，瓦片業又大盛，惟性質與前大異，買資者非為置產，多係「搗把」牟利，出租者或居奇勒索，貸房者或意存訛佔，完全變態，相尙以詐，惟利是圖。勝利以來，雖敵人被逐，而其所這之「社會病」，驟難湔滌。益以三年以來，內患又作，四郊多壘，都市之病熊有增無减，「瓦片」生活，尤感困難。空房出租，論麵計値固是一法，但「每間一袋」乃至半袋，皆非房客所能堪。卽勉强繳付一兩個月，以後無以為繼，彼時收租要麵則無有，若逐客　房則「精神容易送神難」，只好聽其白住。如不出租，不但屬人看守，工食不貲，且當有「不速之客」（丘八及丘九）居之不疑，主人亦無如之何。</p>

<h3 id="e1">President Weng Convenes Financial and Economic Chiefs for Economic Control Meeting; Price Controls to be Applied Flexibly to Revitalize the Market; Continued Discussions This Morning for Final Decisions <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Premier Weng Wenhao, in order to study and formulate supplementary new measures for financial and economic reforms, and to seek stability in the current economy, specially invited heads of political economy and life management departments and economic management officials to Government House No. 1 at 3:00 PM on the 27th for an economic control meeting. Attendees included Wang Yunwu, Xu Kan, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, Guan Jiyu, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Baiyuan, Li Weiguo, Zuo Shunsheng, Shen Yi, Wu Zhaohong, and Wu Guozhen and Jiang Jingguo, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai, and Liu Gongyun, among others, totaling more than ten people. Premier Weng personally presided over the meeting. First, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Guozhen, Jiang Jingguo, and Xu Kan reported on the supervision of economic controls in various regions, as well as the phenomenon of materials escaping from Tianjin, Shanghai, and the southwest. Then, new supplementary measures for finance and economics were discussed, with a broad exchange of views on various financial and economic issues. The price control issue, which is of most concern to the general public, was discussed for the longest time. The opinions of the participants were largely consistent, and it was generally agreed that the price control policy should be maintained. However, this policy must be applied flexibly, and any unreasonable price limits should be actively adjusted to revitalize the market and regulate supply and demand. In particular, the prices of daily necessities for the people's livelihood must be stabilized. Points such as increasing production, implementing allocation by coupons, controlling materials, and tightening issuance were also generally approved at the meeting. The participants spoke enthusiastically, and made practical and in-depth reviews of the current economic situation. They unanimously advocated that countermeasures should be decided immediately and announced as soon as possible. The results of the discussions on the 27th, due to some issues still awaiting detailed study, were scheduled to be held again at 9:00 AM on the 28th to continue the discussion and make a final decision. These new measures include various countermeasures related to solving current financial and economic problems, and are another complete set of financial and economic measures after the currency reform. It is expected that after the announcement of these new measures, the economic situation will improve, and the recent unstable economic situation can gradually stabilize.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu Guozhen, summoned by Premier Weng via telegram, took a express train to Nanjing at 7:30 yesterday morning with Section Chief Zhang Bide of the Protocol Section to attend the important meeting convened by the Executive Yuan yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen and Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo arrived in Nanjing by plane from Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. They immediately called on Premier Weng in the morning to report on the economic management work in the Shanghai area. Mayor Wu also paid a visit to Premier Weng at 2:00 PM to report on the situation of Shanghai's municipal administration and industry and commerce. Both of them attended the Economic Management Committee convened by Premier Weng in the afternoon and are scheduled to return to Shanghai after continuing to attend the Economic Management Committee on the 28th.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Executive Yuan Vice President Zhang Lisheng returned from supervising economic management in the north and attended the Economic Management Meeting on the same day to report on the progress and difficulties of the work. He met with reporters on the evening of the 27th and spoke freely about the situation in Peiping and Tientsin over the past two months. Zhang first stated: "My failure is due to ineffective supervision, but the overall policy has not failed. As for the rumor that Peiping and Tientsin have canceled price controls, there is no such thing. However, I admit the existence of the black market, and the black market prices are higher than those in Nanjing and Shanghai. But the Supervision Office still adheres to government laws and severely punishes illegal merchants and cracks down on the black market." Zhang also stated: "The source of food in Peiping and Tientsin is difficult. Most people have stored several months' worth of food. Therefore, the crackdown focuses on being lenient to households and severely punishing merchants. The first step taken is education, followed by action." Zhang admitted that the low salaries of public servants and teachers, the rampant black market prices, and the escape of materials are important issues that should be reviewed today. However, "negotiated pricing" is absolutely unacceptable, and is not worthy of consideration. Zhang firmly opposes negotiated pricing, but adjusting prices, dredging food sources, increasing production, and facilitating transportation are all issues that should be considered and studied. Zhang's return to Peiping after this trip to Nanjing is not yet determined, because Zhang believes that the main target of supervision is the people's exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and the control of prices should be the responsibility of the local government. Zhang spoke firmly, hoping that the people would jointly assist the government in completing the established policy under difficult circumstances with multiple factors.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Legislators Luo Heng and Others Request the Formulation of Supplementary Regulations for Issuance to Manage Currency Quantity and Maintain the Credit of Gold Yuan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] Legislators Luo Heng and 58 others recently proposed to expedite the formulation of supplementary regulations for the issuance of Gold Yuan, implement the management of currency quantity, restrict issuance in stages, and stipulate the limited legal tender status of subsidiary coins to stabilize the currency value. They advocated that the government should make every effort to maintain the credit of the Gold Yuan, and open up new sources of revenue or strictly economize expenditures, so that the total amount of 2 billion Gold Yuan must be maintained at least until the end of 1950 (that is, when the Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Crisis expire). According to the provisions of the Temporary Provisions, the four methods in the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree promulgated by the President on August 20 should be completed through legislative procedures and separate laws should be formulated. At the same time, a "Supplementary Regulations for the Issuance of Gold Yuan" should also be formulated. The draft regulations attached to the proposal of Luo and others have a total of 16 articles, the main points of which are: (1) Managing the quantity of currency issued, stipulating the limit of accumulated issuance in stages. 1. In the first stage, from the date of currency reform, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued in the first month to the third month shall not exceed 50% of the total issuance amount, that is, 1 billion Gold Yuan (of which 600 million yuan will be used to collect gold, silver, and foreign currency, 300 million yuan will be used to make up for the fiscal deficit, and 100 million yuan and subsidiary coins equivalent to 100 million yuan will be used to collect legal currency and Northeastern circulating notes. By this point, the 100 million yuan of subsidiary coins may not be included in the issuance of standard currency. 2. In the second stage, from the fourth month to the eighth month after the reform, a total of five months, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued each month shall not exceed 4% of the total issuance amount, that is, 80 million Gold Yuan. 3. In the third stage, from the ninth month to the sixteenth month after the reform, a total of eight months, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued each month shall not exceed 2.125% of the total issuance amount, that is, 42.5 million Gold Yuan. 4. In the fourth stage, from the seventeenth month to the twenty-ninth month after the reform, a total of thirteen months, the amount of Gold Yuan standard currency issued each month shall not exceed 1% of the total issuance amount, that is, 20 million Gold Yuan. (2) Stipulating that the standard currency has unlimited legal tender status, and the subsidiary currency has limited legal tender status.

<h3 id="e17">The Economic Sickness Cannot Be Delayed Any Longer! <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The market these days is, to put it mildly, like celebrating New Year's Eve or New Year's Day; to put it more urgently, people generally feel threatened by the shortage of daily necessities. Of course, the people also know that what the government says about "not having shortages" is not a deception, but it is a fact that goods cannot be bought at the fixed prices. You can't buy rice, you can't buy oil, you can't buy firewood and coal briquettes, you can't buy fish, meat and vegetables. The government sets fixed prices on the surface, but the market is actually a black market! The government naturally cannot but rush to plan for this extraordinary situation, and the people cannot but anxiously hope for a solution. The situation has reached this point, and it is absolutely impossible to remedy it by further delays?</p>
<p>Therefore, Premier Weng is anxious, and Minister of Finance Wang is also anxious. Thus, in the secret review meeting in the Legislative Yuan on the 18th of this month, Premier Weng analyzed the causes of the "abnormal" situation, and Minister of Finance Wang put forward four remedial measures. On the 21st, Premier Weng convened a meeting of key central managers, but opinions were not unified; on the 23rd, Premier Weng flew from the capital to Peiping to ask for instructions from the President; on the 24th, he sought the opinions of professors and experts from various universities in Peiping; on the 25th, Premier Weng flew back to the capital, and the professors in Peiping published their "Petition for the People"; on the 26th, the Legislative Yuan resolved to eradicate panic buying and submitted inquiries to the Executive Yuan, while the Control Yuan resolved to submit a correction proposal to the Executive Yuan; on the 27th, Premier Weng convened supervisors in charge of various regions to discuss supplementary measures for economic reform, but no results were achieved. It is said that even if some results are achieved in today's continued discussions, it will still have to wait for the discussion and approval of the Central Political Conference of the Kuomintang, and then be submitted to the political affairs meeting of the Executive Yuan for a decision. In this way, this urgent problem will inevitably have to be delayed for another two or three days; however, "delay" is ultimately not a solution to the problem!</p>
<p>The "abnormality" of the economic situation is the symptom of an economic illness. This disease starts with the disruption of the economic flow and ends with the panic buying of goods. Twenty days ago, the trend of panic buying began; now the trend of panic buying seems to have subsided in Shanghai, but in reality, there is almost no goods to buy, so how can people panic buy? If you hired a doctor who only looked at the superficial symptoms, you might mistakenly think that the illness has improved at this time, but in fact, the evil has sunk inward. Without a powerful medicine, I am afraid that the "disease will not heal." The "Petition for the People" by the professors of various universities in Peiping, although not necessarily a perfect remedy, is at least a decoction prescribed based on the pulse and medical history, and will not be completely ineffective. What the central government is discussing should also be largely the same. Unfortunately, this prescription is a little too late in being contributed; or perhaps there were people who offered suggestions before, but only because they were not famous doctors in the old capital, they were not valued by the authorities, and the economic illness was allowed to gradually enter a hopeless stage. But today, we respectfully advise the government authorities not to hide their illness from the doctor any longer, and not to delay this serious economic illness any further.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the government must be responsible for ensuring that good civilians holding Gold Yuan notes can buy the essential necessities of life. To do this, we must first start with "smooth flow of goods"; and to "smooth the flow of goods", we must completely remove all man-made root causes that block the exchange of goods from top to bottom, from beginning to end. Recently, we have often heard the authorities loudly calling for encouraging the mutual exchange of materials in various places, which shows that they also know the importance of the exchange of goods and the danger of "economic stagnation." Little do they know that the responsibility for the morbid state of today's goods not flowing smoothly lies with the government itself. If you don't think about this root cause, but instead use "barter" to promote exchange in a piecemeal way, it is really like what Mencius said, "Why should Xu Zi not be afraid of trouble?" Therefore, the first step in treating today's serious economic illness lies in removing the dams built by the government to block the exchange of goods - checkpoints everywhere! This dam has long exceeded the scope of inspection required by the measures to crack down on hoarding!</p>
<p>Secondly, we can talk about fixed prices and negotiated prices. Today, Shanghai has fixed prices, and many places have negotiated prices. Shanghai with fixed prices cannot buy necessities, Chengdu with negotiated prices is gradually filling up with goods, and Tianjin, which has abolished fixed prices and switched to negotiated prices, has seen prices gradually fall; what does this show? Now it seems that talking about negotiated prices is destroying fixed prices and violating the emergency measures order of "August 19th": this is not the case. On the contrary, only knowing to fix prices on the surface but actually failing to fix them, turning a blind eye to the rampant black market, or disregarding the fact that people cannot buy their essential necessities, this is destroying fixed prices. Although Article 13 of the strengthened economic control measures attached to the "August 19th" order stipulates fixed prices, Article 14 clearly stipulates that "if there are special reasons, prices may not be increased without the approval of the competent authorities," which shows that the competent authorities should consider reasonable adjustments for those who request adjustments to their prices for special reasons. Only by allowing reasonable negotiated prices can there be reasonable fixed prices; negotiated prices and fixed prices seem to be opposite but are actually complementary. Moreover, to strictly fix prices, they must be fixed uniformly across the country, and there cannot be fixed prices here and no fixed prices there, fixed prices for A and no fixed prices for B. In short, the time has come for the government to be responsible for resolving the economic crisis. We earnestly hope that it will no longer argue over the terms "fixed prices" and "negotiated prices", but must seek an effective remedy for "smooth flow of goods".</p>
<h3 id="e18">Annual Meeting of the Institute of Engineers: Special Topic Discussion on China's Construction Investment Issues, Presidential Office Telegraph Urges Registration of Industrial Talents <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 27th] The annual meeting of the Institute of Engineers was presided over by Zhao Zukang this morning. First, Yang Jiayu, Director of the Taiwan Construction Department, gave a speech entitled "Introduction to Taiwan's Construction", which was divided into four areas: farmland, water conservancy, industry and mining, and transportation. He said that Taiwan has entered the stage of increasing production after three years of restoration work. Various important facilities and outputs have exceeded the records of the Japanese occupation period, such as water conservancy, agricultural products, and electricity. As for industry and mining, they have not yet been fully developed, which is limited by the relationship between raw materials and trade. The inherent conditions for Taiwan's construction are actually poor, especially water conservancy is the most serious problem. More than 40 large and small rivers are more harmful than the Yellow River. Therefore, the provincial government is investing heavily in water conservancy projects, with annual recurring expenses reaching 20 billion Taiwan dollars. In addition, it is also engaged in fundamental projects. It plans to complete the Shihmen Reservoir in five years, with a budget of 40 billion Taiwan dollars, which is beyond the financial capacity of the province. Therefore, it plans to issue water conservancy public bonds, which will be converted into kind to avoid the impact of currency values and facilitate progress. The future of Taiwan's construction is actually quite difficult, especially the problem of raw material supply and the problem of integration with the whole country, which need to be studied urgently. I hope the conference will provide opinions. Zhao Zukang then added that he felt that Taiwan's construction had three advantages: (1) public works are widely constructed, (2) agriculture, industry and mining are closely coordinated, and (3) labor is fully utilized. Therefore, the central government should do its best to assist Taiwan in increasing production and assist various provinces in the mainland. Then began a special topic discussion, with Cheng Xiaogang speaking on "China's Construction Investment Issues" and Yun Zhen serving as chairman. Cheng said that there are two types of investment: one is investment for need, and the other is investment for profit. The former belongs to national defense and public construction, and the latter belongs to people's livelihood. Both must obtain strong guarantees from the government to be fully absorbed. Therefore, the management should be coordinated with policies and should not actively interfere. It is also necessary to avoid unnecessary duplication and excessive regional self-sufficiency, and should pay attention to regional connections. Then, members Xu Sizeng and others expressed their opinions, which are summarized as follows: At present, construction investment, whether from domestic or foreign businessmen, is in a standstill. To find out the root cause, the government should immediately engage in (1) sorting out old debts to restore credit, (2) guaranteeing profits so that long-term investment can be profitable in the short term. For key industries such as transportation and electricity, the government should subsidize or state-owned. Secondly, in terms of attracting capital, the current currency value is unstable, and it is appropriate to issue a substitute unit outside the currency system. The conference afternoon was a report on the affairs of various specialized societies and branches. The topic for the special topic discussion was the possibility of Taiwan's industrial development. The outline includes (1) Taiwan's industrial environment, (2) the expansion and limitations of existing industries, and (3) industries that can be newly established.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch, 27th] The United Annual Meeting of Chinese Engineers recently received a telegram from the Presidential Office, urging the registration of industrial talents for national use.

The U.S. delegation to the UN General Assembly convened itself on the 27th to discuss the Korean issue. Authoritative sources said after the meeting that the fate of U.S. troops in Korea will be decided by this session of the United Nations General Assembly. At a minimum, the United States will request that this General Assembly fully approve the May 10th election in the U.S. military-controlled area of South Korea. The source said that if so, countries will successively recognize the Syngman Rhee government established after the election.

The Soviet letter pointed out that the Four Powers Air Safety Agreement had never been approved by the Allied Control Council and therefore cannot be considered valid. Observers believe that the Soviet action implies an intensified threat to air activities in the corridor area where Western Allied nations are transporting supplies to Berlin.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Paris, 26th] The UN Political Committee met today to discuss the threats to peace in Greece and the Balkans. The United States, China, Britain, France, and other countries condemned Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia for assisting Greek guerrillas. U.S. Representative Dulles stated, "The Soviet Union has repeatedly instructed communist parties around the world that the Soviet Union cannot ensure its security until the power of non-communist countries has been greatly weakened and communist forces have not taken control of the world. The Soviet Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat worldwide." Therefore, we can see that communist parties around the world are merely carrying out the orders of their foreign leaders when they attempt to overthrow or weaken non-communist governments by force and terror.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th Associated Press] The foreign ministers of the five Western European Union countries, after two days of secret meetings, issued a communique stating that the five foreign ministers have, in principle, fully agreed to sign the North Atlantic Defense Treaty with the United States and Canada. According to a Western European official, the five countries' authorities have preliminarily discussed the contents of this treaty, but he declined to explain what the next steps of the five countries would be. It is understood that this treaty, which is currently being drafted, stipulates the nature of U.S. military aid, but the United States does not have time to discuss this matter until the results of the election are obtained. It is understood that this treaty, which is currently being drafted, stipulates that if any of the five Western European countries become involved in war, the United States and Canada will immediately hold emergency consultations with the Western European Union. However, the U.S. government does not have the power to declare war in this situation, as only the U.S. Congress has the power to declare war. The foreign ministers of the five Western European countries believe that this Atlantic Defense Agreement is possible and will eventually be signed. The foreign ministers of the five Western European countries also decided: (1) To establish a five-country committee to study the first steps in establishing a European Federation; (2) To oppose France's suggestion to "immediately convene a preparatory committee to discuss convening a European Parliament"; (3) To formally approve the establishment of the Five-Nation Allied Forces Headquarters, with Montgomery as the commander; (4) To organize a committee of experts to study the financial and economic problems caused by the Western European Defense Agreement; (5) The foreign ministers of the five countries exchanged views on international issues such as Germany, Palestine, and Italian colonies. The purpose of these plans is to unite the five Western European countries militarily and economically so that the United States and Canada can participate in the signing of this treaty.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu stated yesterday that the city's bread factories are allocated 1,000 bags of flour daily by the government at a fixed price, but the supply of bread on the market is very limited. Repeated complaints from citizens have led to the dispatch of investigators for a thorough investigation. Regarding the supply of cigarettes, factories are also delivering goods on schedule, but wholesalers and retailers are holding onto goods without selling, making it extremely difficult for citizens to purchase them. Similarly, businesses such as noodle shops and pastry vendors are allocated flour, but there is very little supply on the market. The government is closely monitoring such hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. As for proposals to allocate flour for large pancakes and fried dough sticks, there is a situation where "old bosses" with evil influence are monopolizing the process. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has specifically stipulated that certification from the neighborhood chief of the stall's location is required, and each stall must directly pay and collect flour. The Civil Affairs Bureau is currently verifying the authenticity of the certifying neighborhood chiefs one by one. Once the verification is complete, the Social Affairs Bureau will begin distributing flour collection certificates, designating locations for payment and flour collection.</p>

Acting Director Li Ximou of the Municipal Education Bureau specially went to Jiangwan yesterday afternoon with representatives of refugee students and faculty to inspect the site. They will be able to move there once the cooking boilers and other equipment are ready.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has specially dispatched Senior Supervisor Zhang Yaonian to Shanghai to consult with relevant parties to provide relief to these refugee students and faculty. It is understood that the Ministry of Education has decided to allocate 30,000 yuan as relief funds. According to Supervisor Zhang's conversation with reporters, these refugee students only intend to stay in Shanghai for a short period of time. The Ministry of Education has decided to select sites in Ningbo, Haining, and cities along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to establish temporary middle schools to accommodate them. They will still be under the jurisdiction of the Shandong Education Department, and the expenses will be borne by the Ministry of Education.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Suppression and Reconstruction Brigade cracked a large-scale fraud organization yesterday. Gao Ruohua, a native of this city, has been making a living by setting up a stall in the Small World Fuyou Market. On the 22nd of this month, he purchased three dozen glass stockings from Guangbang. While he was looking at the goods and asking for prices upstairs, he was spotted by Pan Jie (also known as A San) and Sun Ronglai (also known as A Liu) and six others. They claimed to be members of the Suppression and Reconstruction Team, assigned to work in the Small World area. At that time, they took Gao and the goods to a leather stall in Anren Lane and extorted 400 yuan in gold yuan. Gao temporarily borrowed 300 yuan and paid it, pledging the stockings for the remaining 100 yuan, agreeing to pay it in one day. After Gao returned home and talked to his brother, who happened to be a member of the Youth Service Team, he reported the information to the Suppression and Reconstruction Brigade. The next afternoon, the two criminals, A San and A Liu, were captured. They confessed without hesitation to impersonating team members and committing extortion and confessed that they had over 70 accomplices and had forged red work cards of the team. The organization was huge and the actions were secretive. The Suppression and Reconstruction Brigade is now working with the police to strictly arrest their leader and remaining accomplices.</p>

<h3 id="e86">New Evidence Provided by Police Team Leader in the Case of Corruption by Staff of the Fuel Management Committee; Vivid Testimony of Soliciting Bribes from Two Electrical Companies <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of corruption and malfeasance by staff of the former Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee was previously tried twice by Judge Xie Zhiying of the District Court. The debate was originally scheduled to begin yesterday, but because the police handling the case provided new evidence, the District Court, for prudence, continued the trial yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court by Presiding Judge Shen Tianbao, Judge Shao Renjie, and the original case handler, Judge Xie Zhiying. The 12 defendants in custody, Yang Yunfu, Sun Jice, and others, were brought to the hearing. Presiding Judge Shen first declared the significance of organizing the joint trial, and then the defense lawyer of the defendant Zou Jidao stated that the defendant Yang Yunfu had previously received oral instructions from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that although coal was under control, it was not comparable to opium. He authorized him to appropriately relax restrictions on commercial transportation. Zou Jidao was acting on Yang's orders. He requested the court to send a letter to Minister Chen for investigation. The court then stated that this was quite relevant to the defendant. If there was such a fact, the defendant could provide proof. Then, Wang Sizu, the leader of the action team of the Economic Police Brigade, requested to make a statement because new evidence had been discovered.</p>
<p>The amount of bribery determined the quantity of coal allocated.</p>
<p>It was stated that the two defendants, Sun Gangce and Lin Keying, had engaged in threatening and receiving bribes from the Changzhou Wujin Electrical Company and the Suzhou Electrical Company. Regarding the Changzhou Electrical Company, the company needed 1,400 tons of coal per month, and the amount of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee was uncertain, depending on the amount of bribery. The method of soliciting bribes was quite clever, using various pretexts, such as claiming to be raising donations for schools or being entrusted by sick friends to borrow money. Afterwards, they were never repaid. During festivals, gifts had to be given. Sun Jice sent a handwritten letter to Manager Jiang of the company, stating that his friend was sick and asking to send 20 million legal tender to Shanghai, etc. Wang sent it as instructed. At the end of last year, they sent Sun and Lin each a Parker pen of the 51st model and a Movado watch. During the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival this year, they also sent 6 cans of Chalike cigarettes and 2 bottles of Baijiadi wine each. In September, they also sent 100 gold yuan.</p>
<p>The quantity of coal allocated immediately changed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Suzhou Electrical Company, the company needed 3,500 tons of coal per month. At the end of last year, Sun Jice sent a letter through someone stating that he needed to purchase 100 dan of rice but did not have the money to pay for the seedlings, asking them to temporarily advance the money. Manager Zhang politely declined. Before long, the coal allocation changed. In December, it was reduced to 3,000 tons. In January of this year, it was reduced to 2,500 tons, of which 1,500 tons had to be transported to Nanjing. Manager Zhang had no choice but to visit Sun's residence at the beginning of the year with Assistant Manager Ding of the company for the New Year, leaving behind a bill of exchange for 100 million. By March of this year, the coal allocation had been restored, and the convenience of collecting coal in Shanghai was granted. In the following months, he did not continue to offer gifts. In August, it was reduced by 500 tons again, and they were notified that it would be reduced by another 200 tons in September. Manager Zhang believed that the factual need was indispensable, so he borrowed a check for 1,000 gold yuan from a friend surnamed Zhang and sent it to Sun's residence on September 22nd. Sun agreed to help, and then formally stated in the office that the reduced coal quantity for August would be reissued immediately, and September would be allocated as usual. The company also gave a big banquet for the staff of the association at the Xinghualou in this city. When asked by the court, Sun claimed to have raised 20 million for the "Humanities Research Institute," and the loan for a friend's illness was returned afterwards. He did not remember whether he had received gifts. However, he denied the matter of asking the Suzhou Electrical Company to advance money for rice. Afterwards, Le Zhuangxin, the investigation section chief of the Municipal Government, came to the court to testify. Then, the defense lawyers of each defendant provided their defense separately. They adjourned from court at around 1:00 PM and ordered a retrial at another date.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Suspected Communist Spy Student Case: First Group of Nine Indicted; Liu Zongjun and Fifteen Others Not Indicted <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The special criminal court has concluded its investigation of over eighty students accused of being communist spies. The portion of the investigation led by Prosecutor Wang Naizhang was announced yesterday. Defendants Li Lingyun and five others, as well as Shi Zongjiang and four others, were all indicted for endangering the nation. Liu Zongjun and fifteen others were not indicted. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Facts of the Indictment</p>
<p>The indictment against five students from the Shanghai Art College (美專), Li Lingyun, Lu Hanhua, Chen Liping, Wu Shuzhi, and Liu Ming (female), states: "On June 5th of this year, a group of students in this city, under the pretext of opposing American support for Japan, held a collective demonstration. On the same day, a section of the Shanghai Art College's student union also prepared to demonstrate, but were prevented by another section of the school's students, resulting in a fight in which Li Lingyun, Lu Hanhua, Chen Liping, Wu Shuzhi, and Liu Ming were injured and sent to the police hospital for treatment. During their treatment, they secretly communicated with students visiting from outside the school via notes. After the police bureau seized these notes, they were deemed to contain elements of a subversive organization, and the defendants were sent to court for investigation. According to the defendants' statements, they claimed ignorance of the details of "Opposing America's support of Japan," but investigation revealed that Li Lingyun wrote notes to Lu Hanhua and Chen Liping, placed them in matchboxes, and threw them onto the road for students like Zheng Yu of the Shanghai Art College. The wording was strong, and reviewing the contents shows that the defendants' "Oppose America's support of Japan" demonstration was a planned and organized action. Furthermore, two unmailed letters from Wu Shuzhi to Xiao Han (i.e., Liu Ming) were found on his person, expressing great admiration for Liu's work for the week and mentioning going to Jiaotong University (交大) on the fourth. He also admitted during the court hearing that he did go to the Jiaotong University student union on the afternoon of the fourth to make contact, and that Liu Ming was very busy helping to cut and paste newspapers and cartoons. Furthermore, a letter from the China Vocational Student Self-Government Association (中華職業學生自治會) to the injured students of the Shanghai Art College was discovered, stating: "We feel angry in our hearts that you were beaten for participating in the anti-American support of Japan rally. You Shanghai Art College students must be the spark that ignites [the revolution], and we will always follow you in marching towards tomorrow. We must win." In addition, many similar letters were seized. All of this is sufficient to prove that the defendants participated in communist activities. Furthermore, investigation revealed that during the student demonstration, the police bureau intercepted communist propaganda on the Bund, including one item listing reactionary slogans and including "The CCP Northwest Central Bureau's Announcement of Celebrating the Liberation of Yan'an (中共西北中央局慶祝光復延安之通告)." Therefore, it is extremely clear that this anti-American support of Japan demonstration and the distribution of leaflets were orchestrated and propagandized by the communists. Since the defendants had prior criminal intent and contact, even though they were temporarily prevented from participating by fellow students within the school, they still cannot escape joint responsibility. Li Lingyun and others are all suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Statute for the Punishment of Endangering the Nation During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion (戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例) and Articles 11 and 28 of the Criminal Law (刑法), and are being prosecuted according to the law."</p>
<p>The indictment against the other four defendants, Shi Zongjiang, Zhou Jingyong, Tao Dingguo, and Zhu Peigen, states the following facts: Shi was the person in charge of communist intelligence at Fudan University, investigating our students' activities and participating in various student movements; Zhou was a student at Jinan University, participating in the student union and instigating student movements; Tao was a student at Tongji University, participating in the communist spy organization; Zhu was a student at Soochow University, a key member of the communist party at the school, responsible for contacting, printing, and disseminating the student newspaper, and is the son of Zhu Xuefan. Fifteen individuals were not indicted due to insufficient evidence of criminal activity: Liu Zongjun, Huang Guangchao, Zhao Zihan, Gu Kejian, Qin Yiming (above from Fudan), Zha Hongbao (female), Chen Fuheng, Chen Dingping, Zhang Shirong, Luo Jiaqi (above from Soochow), Wang Gangjun (Shanghai Baptist University), Sha Zhen (female) (Tongji), Wu Yuanzheng (Nantong College), Xu Yi (Minzhi New College), Wang Rongbao (Yongan Company employee).</p>

<p>Traveling north from Hangzhou along the Grand Canal, the fields on both banks are like brocade, with mulberry and locust trees forming forests. In the distance, the mountains rise and fall, the rivers crisscross, and the branches diverge. Lotus ponds and fishponds are everywhere. This is also a water town, but slightly different from those of Jiaxing (嘉). Jiaxing is mostly flat plains, while this area also has hills and mountains.</p>
<p>After two hours by steamboat, we turn into Deqing County. Three hours later, we arrive at Deqing City. Deqing was occupied by the enemy twice during the War of Resistance. The mountains surrounding the county seat are like a protective screen. The waterways run through the city, connecting to Tangxi in Hangzhou County, Linghu in Wuxing, Xinshi in Jiaxing, Wuzhen in Tongxiang, and Shimenwan in Chongde. Transportation is convenient in all directions, and most of the county residents use boats as their only means of transportation. The houses in the city are neat, and the people's clothing is also clean. Before the war, Deqing County had a population of 170,000, but after the war, it only has 140,000.</p>
<p>The county produces silkworms, fish, water chestnuts, and wool, among other things. Rice production is not high, and the supply is barely sufficient for the county's needs. The silkworm production this year is 5,000 dan, and the autumn silkworm harvest is very good. The selling price is also very good, and each dan can get 120 to 130 yuan, which can also buy six or seven dan of rice at the fixed price. The fish here are freshwater fish, with an annual output of about 10,000 dan, which are transported and sold to Shanghai and other places. This year, due to more rain and rising rivers, the harvest is not as good as ideal. Water chestnuts are also a specialty and can be transported to Shanghai for use in making water chestnut flour. This year's output is particularly high, and the price is not good. The annual wool production is about 1,000 dan, which is transported to Shanghai and then shipped abroad. The local selling price is about 100 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the economic situation in Deqing County is not too bad. However, since the government implemented price controls, there has also been a buying panic. The goods in the stores are hidden away, pork is hard to buy, rice is also difficult to buy, and even pickled cucumbers and other items from the pickle shops are not for sale.</p>
<p>From Deqing to Linghu, the steamboat takes two hours. This is a place that is thriving. It also produces silkworms, water chestnuts, and fish and shrimp, and the output is quite abundant.</p>
<p>From Linghu to Wuxing County, the steamboat also takes two hours. Along the way, lotus ponds stretch continuously. Many lotus barrels carry young girls, rowing into the depths of the lotus leaves to pick fresh water chestnuts.</p>
<p>In the county seat of Wuxing, the most essential areas are paved with cement roads, and the shops on both sides are very neat and look very prosperous. The county seat has a population of more than 110,000, and the entire county has a population of 560,000. This area is rich in silkworms, with an annual output of 150,000 dan. There are many silk factories, and there are also many households with zero-loom weaving. There are two newspapers in the area, one is the Huzhou Daily (湖報) and the other is the Commercial Daily (商報). The Huzhou Daily has a daily circulation of 800 copies, and the Commercial Daily has a slightly smaller circulation.</p>
<p>In addition to silk, Wuxing also produces water chestnuts, fish, shrimp, and wool. There is also a kind of writing brush, which is also a famous product. Anyone who uses a writing brush to write Chinese characters knows the great reputation of "Huzhou brushes" (湖筆). The advantage of Huzhou brushes is that they do not shed hair, and the manufacturing method is very exquisite. Its farthest sales area is Harbin. However, the famous "Huzhou brushes" are not produced in Huzhou County itself. They are born in Shanlian Town in Deqing County, where many families make a living by making brushes. During the War of Resistance, the enemy dropped bombs on Shanlian Town, driving the brush makers to other places, and most of them chose to go to Suzhou. The current production is not as high as before.</p>
<p>A person from Wuxing told me: "Wuxing County is the end of the mountains and the beginning of the water." The so-called end of the mountains refers to the foot of the Tianmu Mountains. The beginning of the water is the beginning of the Tiaoxi River, and it is also on the edge of the Taihu Lake basin. If we describe it, Wuxing, or even Huzhou Prefecture, can be said to have both the beauty of mountains and water. It is a pity that many mountains have not been widely planted with trees, and many rivers have not paid attention to dredging. If trees are planted on the mountains and rivers are dredged, this year's fishing season should be very good. Moreover, after the rivers are dredged, and the water chestnut seedlings are improved and planted, the water chestnuts produced must be fat, large, and of good quality.</p>
<p>The climate in Huzhou Prefecture is mild and suitable for sheep farming. The wool here is already sold abroad. If the grass that the sheep eat is studied and improved, and the sheep's living quarters and pastures are cleaned and rationalized, a lot of foreign exchange can be earned from wool alone.</p>
<p>Now, due to price controls, most of the materials in Huzhou Prefecture are frozen. Taking fish as an example, many people do not catch fish from the fish ponds to transport and sell to Shanghai. This will affect future production.</p>
<p>The security situation in Huzhou Prefecture is very good. In more than a year, theft cases have become almost an exception. I think in this stable environment, the people of Huzhou Prefecture should find ways to improve their own production!</p>

<h3 id="e103">Increase Tung Oil Production; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Sends Personnel to Guizhou Province for Inspection <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Airmail from this newspaper, Guiyang, 23rd] In order to increase the output of tung oil in Guizhou Province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry specially dispatched Inspector Deng [illegible] to inspect the area. After arriving in Guiyang on the 9th, he went to various counties for on-site inspections. According to Deng, "Tung oil ranks first in our country's export commodities. The demand from the United States and other industrial countries is extremely large. It is estimated that annual exports require approximately 400 million pounds, but our country's pre-war output was only over 100 million pounds. Even if all of it is exported, the difference is still very large. During the war, many tung forests were damaged. Due to the difficulty of foreign sales, tung farmers did not pay attention to the tung forests, and even cut down the tung forests for fuel, resulting in a sharp reduction in output. The current export demand has increased sharply, and it is impossible to supply a large quantity. In order to cooperate with national policy and earn foreign exchange, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided that starting from the 38th year of the Republic, tung oil production will be greatly increased in the main tung-producing areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Zhejiang and other five provinces. Currently, preparations are being made for investigation and design work. It is expected to complete the task within the year in order to implement concrete measures to increase production next year." Deng Juye consulted with the Department of Construction and the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute (省農改所), and the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute dispatched technician Liu Ganming to conduct on-site investigations in the main tung-producing areas of the province and collect various data on the production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales of tung oil as the basis for formulating the implementation plan. It is planned to select three suitable locations in eastern Guizhou, northern Guizhou, and western Guizhou to set up tung oil factories for demonstration purposes.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Huainan Coal Piled Up Awaiting Transportation; Huainan Railway to be Restored to Chaoxian County, Then Use Small Boats to Transport to Wuhu for Transshipment <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Wuhu, 27th] Huainan coal production has exceeded 4,000 tons per day. However, due to the single-track transportation of the Jinpu Railway, it is impossible to smoothly transport all of it to Pukou (浦口), resulting in a coal shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai. The black coal from the Jiulonggang (九龍崗) and Bagongshan (八公山) producing areas is piling up. To this end, the Huainan Mining and Railway Bureau plans to speed up the restoration of the Hefei-Yuxi (合肥裕溪) section after the Shuishui (水合) section is opened to traffic, so that Huainan coal can be transported separately on two lines to Pukou and Yuxikou (裕溪口) on both sides of the Yangtze River, and then transferred to boats to supply various ports along the Yangtze River. It is now learned that the restoration of the Hefei-Yuxi section is limited by the lack of steel rails, so only the Hefei-Chaoxian County section can be completed first. The Chaoxian County-Yuxi section can be navigated by 100-ton small boats all year round, arriving at noon after an early departure. Each boat tows wooden boats to transport coal, just like a train. Currently, since the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway is open to traffic, there are about 70 small boats gathered in the Wuhu area. Once the water becomes shallow in winter, the lines to Wuwei, Xuancheng, and Nanling will be suspended. If the Hefei-Chaoxian County section of the railway is restored earlier, the small boats are very willing to work hard to transport coal. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation recently summoned Xia Shufang, the manager of the Wuhu Merchants Steam Navigation Company (蕪招商局), to inquire about water and land transportation in the Hefei-Yuxi section, and instructed that the postal delivery between Wuhu and Anqing is too slow and ordered the Wuhu shipping industry to quickly fix the liner between Wuhu and Anqing.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Resolution of the First Serious Problem: The Grain Storage Movement in Shenyang Shenyang, 20th (Air Mail) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>The suffering Fanyang, struggling in hardship, seeking survival in desolation, still seems resilient and energetic!</p>
<p>Although the population has decreased from two million to eight hundred thousand, although most of the shops are closed and businesses are suspended, and although fewer people eat noodles and more eat bean dregs and bran, society has become simpler and more stable.</p>
<p>The first serious problem in Fanyang is the grain shortage because there is no source of grain. Air transport is ultimately limited, so how can it support the food for over eight hundred thousand people and five or six large armies—of course, military rations are only a part of it.</p>
<p>Disaster and hardship seem inseparable. In late spring and early summer this year, Fanyang faced a difficult period of grain scarcity, followed by an unprecedented aphid plague in late summer and early autumn. Disaster and hardship are almost inseparable from Fanyang.</p>
<p>The military and political authorities attach great importance to this life-and-death juncture for Fanyang and are very anxious. The provincial and municipal leaders have put all their effort and energy into the "grain problem."</p>
<p>Mayor Dong Wenqi told reporters: "When I returned to the Municipal Government for the second time, grain was my top priority in governance, and other work came second!"</p>
<p>Indeed, he solved the grain crisis in Fanyang this spring during the time of grain scarcity. Now, he is vigorously promoting a city-wide grain storage movement. He said with a smile: "People oppose hoarding, but I am advocating a disguised form of hoarding!"</p>
<p>Of course, his grain storage movement seems to be encouraging citizens to hoard, but everyone should remember that Fanyang's situation is special! The source of grain is difficult! His grain storage movement is precisely aimed at reality and is solving a major problem.</p>
<p>His planned goals and methods are: "Each factory must store at least three months' worth of food for its own use. All mines and factories must go to other counties to purchase grain, or entrust grain merchants and the Municipal Food Allocation Committee to purchase it on their behalf. Another 10,000-person grain purchasing team will be formed, with interest-free loans of 150 gold yuan per person, to be repaid in half a month."</p>
<p>In order to seize the opportunity when the new grain after the disaster is available, factory and mine trucks, merchant carts, citizen pushcarts, bicycles, and grain purchasing teams carrying sacks appear on the small roads and highways of Liaozhong, Xinmin, Faku, Tieling, Liaoyang, and Fushun, a magnificent procession, exerting infinite power.</p>
<p>The grain storage movement is proceeding smoothly. The grain prices in Fanyang market are falling every day, and idle funds are being used for grain, which not only solves most of the grain shortage in Fanyang but also prevents the wave of panic buying of goods that has occurred in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places.</p>
<p>Although the peasants in the surrounding villages can barely maintain enough food to eat, they lack cloth and other daily necessities. This time, the grain purchasing teams have been granted permission to exchange cloth and other daily necessities for grain, thus benefiting both sides greatly, so the effect is significant.</p>
<p>In the past, the layers of checkpoints around Fanyang have greatly hindered the exchange of goods. Some people said, "The fear of gold, silver, and cloth flowing into the bandit areas does not seem to have decreased. For example, in the past month or two, gauze has been indirectly exchanged for apples from the Trade Bureau of the bandit area in Southern Liaoning."</p>
<p>Commander Wei greatly appreciates Mayor Dong's grain storage movement. In addition to accepting Mayor Dong's suggestion to remove the restrictions on the grain purchasing teams at the checkpoints, he also came up with a solution that commercial vehicles in Fanyang must go out to transport grain at least ten times before they can operate in the city.</p>
<p>Recently, military and political officials in Fanyang have been constantly going to the countryside to supervise the concentration of grain, and Fanyang City is also promoting the grain storage movement. As long as Fanyang does not fall, there will be a way for everything in the Northeast. In addition, with the development of the Northeast situation, the prospects are good and the hope is infinite.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Cotton from Producing Areas Changed to Spinning Native Yarn, Scarcity of Raw Cotton Supply, National Bank Allocates 10,000 Pieces of Yarn to Transport to Producing Areas to Exchange for Cotton <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Cotton trading has been sluggish for a long time. Although the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office is trying its best to collect through finished product swaps, there are many difficulties ahead, and various details are not easy to eliminate. The cotton merchants in this city have repeatedly contacted the Joint Purchasing Association regarding stocks in Shanghai, but because the Joint Purchasing Association has not made a specific decision on the collection of cotton through finished product swaps, they are all waiting and watching. In addition, cotton merchants' stocks in other ports will also be sold locally after the exchange ratio is determined, and the finished products obtained will be used to purchase cotton from the producing areas.</p>
<p>Further News: Since the implementation of economic controls, it has been two months and counting. Because the export of yarn and cloth from this port is restricted, the supply is scarce, and the rural areas desperately need cloth. According to cotton industry news: when new cotton enters the market this year, cotton is not sold everywhere. The peasants believe that the flowers grown in the fields must be sold at the limited price, and the daily necessities they need, such as cloth, soap, and fertilizer, cannot be bought at the limited price in the countryside. Therefore, they are unwilling to sell new cotton, and some of them change to spinning native yarn to weave native cloth and socks. It is heard that in some counties and cities near the cotton-producing areas, there are many native yarn looms on the market, and rural handicrafts are ten times more profitable.</p>
<p>Further News: The Bank has allocated more than 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn to be transported to various cotton-producing areas to exchange for cotton at cost. The detailed measures have been taken to Beijing by Vice President Liu of the National Bank to be submitted to the authorities for approval. Once approved, they can be announced and transported.</p>
<h3 id="e108">After Implementing the Exchange of Cloth for Rice, a Large Amount of Rice Can Flow In, Yesterday the Supply to the Two Markets Was Even Scarcer <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] In recent days, rice arriving at the North and South markets has only been about 1,000 piculs per day, and a large amount has not yet been seen to flow in. However, rice merchants observe that the four types of cloth allocated by the authorities for rice exchange have now been distributed, and each colleague can carry out barter with the producing areas separately, which can greatly alleviate the difficulty of purchasing rice. Also, according to past practice, new rice has been entering the market successively after the Double Ninth Festival. Now that it is the peak season for new rice, it is expected that after the exchange of cloth for rice, a large amount of rice will flow in around the 10th of next month. It is also learned that the situation of difficulties and deductions in the weight when purchasing rice in various places has improved recently. Rice procurement in remote areas, such as Jiangxi and Anhui, is limited due to the lack of train cars. It is heard that in order to solve the difficulty of purchasing rice, the second batch of in-kind exchange for rice will be to allocate rural daily necessities such as soap and sugar to rice merchants for rice exchange.</p>
<p>Further News: The supply of rice yesterday was even scarcer because there was less supply from the producing areas, it was not easy to purchase, and some producing birds were unwilling to let it go. However, with the implementation of the exchange of cloth for rice method, it is expected that colleagues will purchase more enthusiastically, and the supply can be increased immediately. Yesterday, the South Market arrived with a total of 676 piculs, and the North Market arrived with 335 piculs, totaling 1,011 piculs in the two markets.</p>
<p>The trading of miscellaneous grains is watching and waiting before the cost is adjusted and before the exchange with industrial products begins. The allocation of soybeans has been suspended because the exchange method has not been determined, and all transactions are waiting for government regulations to be active.</p>
<h3 id="e109">No Trading of Sugar <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Trading in the sugar market has ceased due to legal restrictions. The guild's allocation has not been implemented, and the subjective wait-and-see attitude has become more firm. The sales of Southern goods stores are fiercely competing for purchases every day. The supply is vast. Although purchases have been restricted in recent days, the quantity is less, and more is purchased. The queues are like long snake formations all day long, starting from queuing in the early morning and not dispersing until closing time. This situation makes it difficult for each store to supply.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Tea Market's Foothold is Solid <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to tea industry sources, the prices of black and green tea varieties in the producing areas, such as Wuyuan, have gradually caught up with those in this city. In addition, the reserves are not very abundant, so the source is becoming increasingly scarce. The re-processing manufacturers in this city believe that the raw tea materials are not easy to add, and because the purchase of all accessories is difficult, they are determined to sell. Although the buyers have a strong appetite, the trading is still narrow, the situation continues to be firm, and the foothold is more solid than before.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Export Materials Exhausted, the Guild Investigates the Reasons <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Since the implementation of economic controls, export materials have been exhausted. Various materials such as tung oil, tea, silk, bristles, and fur cannot be purchased in the producing areas. The reason is that idle funds have no way out. Those who own funds are hoarding in the producing areas, and the circulation of materials has been blocked. Most of the import and export industries in this city are in a state of stagnation. It is learned that the guild is now investigating the comparison of domestic and foreign market prices of various export materials and the situation of blockage. After the data is collected, it will prepare its opinions and send them to the authorities for adoption.</p>

<p>Since the start of trading with Japan by private traders in our country, although the government's restrictions are said to be very strict, affecting the development of trade, they have in fact all profited greatly. It is learned that some small-scale private trading firms in this city are operating as agents for customers and trading goods with Japan. They themselves are in the position of intermediaries, using their surplus income to engage in a small amount of direct trading. And after three months of settlement, the net profit has reached more than 6,000 US dollars. This is a miracle in the midst of private traders' requests to the government to relax controls.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Artificial Silk Business Association has received a notice from the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office believes that artificial silk has been统筹handled by the China Trust Bureau, and the artificial silk market should be closed immediately. The artificial silk raw materials needed by the silk weaving industry are directly allocated by the China Trust Bureau. The association has complied with the order to close the market, but the members have previously supported the national policy and stabilized the price of artificial silk. They have collected inventory and entrusted the association to allocate it at the limited price every day to maintain the needs of various small handicraft industries. During the allocation, the police station sent personnel to monitor. Now that it is ordered to close, all the unallocated inventory includes 18 boxes of 150-count glossy artificial silk, 9 boxes of 120-count glossy artificial silk, 1 box of 75-count matte artificial silk, and about 20 boxes of 120, 150, 100-count various brands of artificial silk stored in the association for daily allocation, and another 156 small packages, all of which have not been allocated. The handling of the above remaining goods is being requested from the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>It was recently learned from the Shanghai Office of the Committee for Handling Japanese Reparation Materials of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that, as of now, the office has actually received the first batch of Japanese reparation machines, totaling 2,144 boxes of machine tools.

<h3 id="e117">Difficulties with Raw Materials for Hardware and Aluminum Products Industries <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Industrial Association's Review is Completed</p>
<p>The Technical Committee of the Industrial Association yesterday continued to announce the difficulties with raw materials for the hardware and aluminum products industries and the urgent need to solve the following methods:</p>
<p>(A) Hardware Industry: The industry's products are numerous and complex, so it needs more types of raw materials. The raw materials that are currently in extremely short supply include brass, copper sheet, copper rod, phosphorus steel wire, foreign yuan Huisi iron, pig iron, iron plate, iron, disc ingot, waste bullet casing, aluminum ingot, bakelite powder, nickel yarn tape, cotton thread, etc. In the past, they were purchased from various firms and manufacturers, and some were imported from abroad. Aluminum and lead were purchased from Taiwan. However, recently, the supply of all raw materials on the market has been almost completely stopped, and there is no way to search for them. Among them, there are also a few raw materials, such as copper sheet, which were previously purchased from the copper and tin industry and now need to be exchanged for waste copper sheet and copper corner. Yarn tape was previously purchased from the ribbon weaving industry, but now it needs to be exchanged for yarn. However, at a time when raw materials are extremely scarce, old materials and exchange items cannot be purchased, so the raw materials for this industry can be said to be completely cut off. In addition, phosphorus copper wire and nickel have long disappeared from the market. If this continues, the future is really unimaginable. It should be resolved as soon as possible to promote development and enable its finished products to be available in the market continuously. The emergency solution is for the Materials Adjustment Committee to order the copper industry, steel industry, ribbon weaving industry, hardware industry, copper and silver industry, and iron industry guilds to supply various raw materials according to the actual needs of each factory.</p>
<p>(B) Aluminum Products Industry: The main raw material needed by the industry is aluminum ingot. The difficulties are as follows: (1) The allocation of foreign exchange is limited and reduced compared to the fourth quarter. (2) Aluminum ingots from Taiwan cannot be supplied as much as possible. Since August 19, 98% of aluminum ingots have not been sold. In addition to requesting the Wheel Management Committee to relax the quota, Taiwan should be requested to ship aluminum ingots to Shanghai as much as possible to supply them.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 27th] Zhang Junmai lectured on "The Philosophical Foundation of Democratic Politics" to more than a thousand students at Sichuan University on the afternoon of the 26th, saying that after the European Renaissance, the "discovery of man" led to three movements: religious reform, scientific development, and democratic politics, to form modern culture. The credibility of religion, the right and wrong of scientific theories, and the good and evil of politics must have an objective standard, that is, reason. The human rights movement of the 18th and 19th centuries placed too much emphasis on individualism and liberalism. After the industrial revolution, social wealth became uneven, and the promotion of social morality emerged. The early 19th century was the era of rationalism, and the late 19th century was the era of will. Therefore, the philosophical foundation of democratic politics in my mind is "rational will."</p>

<h3 id="e148">Wrong Psychology <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>The facts reflected in the authorities' call for thrift are: the special prosperity of restaurants and theaters—everywhere is full, everywhere is full every day!</p>
<p>According to relevant statistics, the tax revenue from banquets and entertainment in September averaged 300,000 gold yuan; this month, up to the 10th, it has reached 200,000 gold yuan, and it is expected that this month's income will be over one million gold yuan. From the perspective of tax revenue, this is a good phenomenon. But from the perspective of why people want to enjoy themselves so frantically, this situation is extremely terrible.</p>
<p>For example, the recent wave of panic buying that has spread throughout the region is believed by some to be the work of scalpers, which cannot be said to be completely without reason. However, the scalpers' actions are only one of several reasons. The main reason is the erroneous psychology of most people.</p>
<p>In the author's humble opinion, the formation of this wrong psychology is: first, of course, the selfishness at work, which is caused by the increase in tobacco tax. Because the increase in tobacco tax has enabled tobacco merchants to obtain double profits out of thin air, general merchants have based on the fact that tobacco tax has increased, thinking that other goods may also increase in price, so they are unwilling to invest in storing goods in order to gain greater profits; the general public, of course, also based on the above point of view, in order to avoid the exploitation of heavy prices, they desperately panic buy. The attitudes of both sides are diametrically opposed, so a man-made phenomenon of demand exceeding supply has been formed, which has caused most daily necessities to have a price but no goods, and thus has constituted a psychological panic for some people.</p>
<p>The soaring increase in entertainment and banquet tax, although there is no such manifestation of form, is also affected by this psychology and fact. For example, because it is difficult for some families to buy food, they simply do not buy it, and all two meals a day are made at restaurants; therefore, the grand situation of queuing to buy meat and queuing to squeeze oil has been found in the vegetable market, and it has also appeared in some restaurants and hotels. This is one of the reasons for the increase in banquet tax revenue.</p>
<p>As for why the business of theaters is so prosperous, I think it is promoted by the following two types of people: one is the numb who "don't care about national affairs." As long as they are warm and well-fed and have surplus money, they will enjoy as much as possible (there are also many of this faction who make the business of restaurants and hotels prosperous). The so-called world situation and the future of the nation are, of course, irrelevant to them. The second are pessimists who have no vision, lack determination, and are decadent. When one thing is not satisfactory, or a situation is not pleasing to the eye, they think that the sky will fall immediately. Therefore, from excitement to decadence, from active to passive, due to decadence and passivity, they blindly embrace the psychology of "drinking today when I have wine" to enjoy themselves wantonly, and euphemistically call it "seeking stimulation." Therefore, a long line of people very naturally becomes an ornament to the theater. This is the reason why entertainment tax has increased.</p>
<p>Of course, the increase in tax revenue is gratifying. But this gratifying thing is built on the contradictory, erroneous, and negative psychology of most people, and this gratifying thing has become terrible again. Because as long as you think about it: we are unfortunately owning so many numb people and decadent people, who hold the psychology that the country and society have nothing to do with themselves or cannot be done, what a sight this is!</p>
<p>Blaming merchants for disregarding morality and blaming citizens for being short-sighted and expanding their selfishness, in today's world of rampant human desires, the result is naturally that "listeners are few," without waiting for divination. Just let it be? Of course, that's not the way to go. Naturally, there is no lack of methods, and the authorities have already formulated them, but the key lies in whether the implementers are serious. Today, we have seen many regulations for stabilizing prices, dredging resources, and implementing thrift. If they can be seriously implemented and the authorities can set an example and achieve the effect of "the upper level setting an example and the lower level following," then the turbulent situation will be clarified. However, this is still a temporary solution. The fundamental solution is how to prevent our next generation from being infected with this despicable, cowardly, and selfish psychology. In a word: how should we teach our next generation?</p>
<p>Some people think that the increase in entertainment and banquet tax is a kind of irony of rigorous thrift, which is just the opposite.</p>
<h3 id="e149">About Mr. Zhu Guwei <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Meizi</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Guwei's achievements in ci poetry, as well as his merits, are things that those who study literary history can generally talk about. His anecdotes are also popular. However, some are repeatedly peddled, and it is inevitable that falsehood will be passed on as falsehood. The world has ridiculed those who like to talk about anecdotes, calling them "copper talk," because the source of anecdotes mostly comes from the capital, and they cannot be called "gold" (homophone of Beijing), so they are copper ears.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's calligraphy was similar to Chu Suiliang's in his early years. The stone carvings that were written for others, such as the tomb inscription of Chu Jun (Cheng Bo) in Yuhang, were gentle and concise, purely the milk of the Dengshan method. Rubbings still exist today. In his later years, he began to concentrate on Yan Zhenqing's style, seeking Huang Tingjian's "full noon and right disease" from the meaning of "horizontal and vertical." Zhao Ziang’s “right side straight down” was lacking. He transformed his usual practice, and the pen force was biased to the right. At that time, many people imitated it, and he once said: "My calligraphy is not worth learning. Learning it will cause problems. This is what is called overcorrection." According to legend, when Mr. Zhu took the palace examination in the Guangxu Guiwei year (9th year), Chao Yiwen Danchu (Jingming) was in charge of the government, and his son also took the exam in this subject. The examiners must have wanted to make him pass the exam to please him, but there was no way to get through the connection. They only knew that he studied Yan's calligraphy but could not do it well. He got a roll and thought it was him, so he listed it as the first name in the second class (commonly known as Chuanlu). When the sealing was torn open, it was clearly "Zhu Zumou." This statement was quite widely circulated, but the name of the so-called "閤公子" could not be mentioned. Based on Mr. Zhu's calligraphy, it was not until his later years that he changed his old style (learning Chu), so we know that it is inaccurate. Yan Zi, named Jiuzhu, styled Junjie, also styled Chengshu, was also a Jinshi in the Guiwei year. After being dismissed from the museum, he changed to the chief of the Ministry of Rites and rose to the position of Hedong Road in Shanxi. (Zhu Ruzhen, Abridged Dictionary of Words) I once saw him inscribing a rubbing of the Meng Shu Stone Scripture for Sheng Jiang Liu Jianzhi (Tigan) in the Yichou year (the 14th year of the Republic of China). He did not write it himself, but ordered his son Xiaosun to do it for him. Xiaosun's calligraphy also practiced Yan's method, but it was not very good.</p>
<p>Some say that Mr. Zhu concealed his birth date and did not tell anyone, which is also untrue. It involves the false transmission of a certain public affair. (Another matter is also not concealing his birthday.) (Mr. Zhu once engraved a small seal, with the text: "Born one month before Zhu Zhuzha" (Zhu Zhuzha's birthday is August 21st), and often used it. On his sixtieth birthday, Gao Yehou (Shixian) took the meaning of Mengchuang's words and wrote chrysanthemums for his birthday, titled it "Xiangyu Tu", and mounted it as a scroll. The inscriptions of famous people at the time were almost everywhere, and they can be seen in various collections. In his life, he had Wang Rongfu's regret of "being deceived by Xinggong" in his marriage. Even on his deathbed, he still had the sentence "rhinoceros horn in his eyes, cow clothes after death," knowing that his hidden pain was deep. Therefore, he firmly believed in the words of astrologers. Whenever there were those who knew the Bazi art, he would ask them, and if they could determine that his "qin and se were not in tune," he would be very happy and consider them knowledgeable. Therefore, the grassroots who knew a little about ci tunes claimed to be his students, pretended to be the list, and became a laughing stock. For example, in the blank of a certain occultist's ci talk in the Ci Journal in the past, it was said that Mr. Zhu advised against using boxers in the Gengzi year, which angered the Empress Dowager and almost became a continuation of the three loyal ministers (Yuan Chang, Xu Jingcheng, Li Shan). He escaped from the crowd because of his short stature, which was ridiculous. Zhang Mengqu (Ertian) once wrote a letter scolding him severely.</p>
<p>All of the above is irrelevant to the main purpose, and it feels redundant to say it, but I feel that I was born in the same world and saw his face. In less than twenty years, I have sighed at the rumors and different words. Then how can we trust the examination of documents and references? Few anecdotes are not "copper talk." Song people's novels like to talk about anecdotes of famous people at the same time, but they mostly lose their truth. Then we know that ancient and modern are one, and it is not surprising. As for "Biyun (Song people's novel name)" being married to Mei Shengyu, the intention is to attack and slander the Yuanyou partisans, which should be kept but not discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Buying a Hope <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>According to Shanghai newspapers, Douzhen lottery tickets are sold out, and there is even a black market.</p>
<p>How strange! With only 120 winning opportunities out of hundreds of thousands of lottery tickets, people are still rushing to buy them, and their luck is too great. But in all fairness, it is both pitiful and regrettable.</p>
<p>People hoped for victory during the Anti-Japanese War, and after the victory, they hoped for peace in the world. Now that victory has been won for three or three years, peace is still far away. Buying lottery tickets, even though there is only a 120/100,000 chance of winning, there is still a hope after all.</p>
<p>Some people bought lottery tickets, hoping to win the prize soon so that they could realize their hopes. But what about me? If I were to buy one or two lottery tickets, I would hope that the drawing would be postponed as long as possible, because the later the drawing, the longer my hope would be extended; if the drawing is postponed forever, my hope will exist forever. Wouldn't that be great?</p>

<p>— Ren Hongjun</p>
<p>I am wandering on Mogan Mountain again. The pines and bamboos are still as secluded as before. A bird's cry gives rise to a sense of coolness, and a few cold flowers herald the early autumn. The ancient temple cannot be expected to survive the disaster, and the bright moon first shines on the top of the mountain. Tomorrow I will use my staff to visit the clouds and visit Zhongmou, the woman in the mountain. (Referring to Mrs. Huang Yingbai)</p>

<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>Lingnan news chokes the autumn soul, not making this person's heaven dark. He was indifferent to fame and fortune and admired the overseas country, and fortunately his bones returned to the fields. The white horse on the border saved the spring appointment (Shulao once promised to visit the White Horse Lake in the spring), and the kapok in the painting recognized the tear stains. Old relatives and friends are falling apart, and I am afraid of passing through the Green Willow Village at sunset.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Going Out <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>I haven't been out for a long time. I took a very short train ride by chance, and then I confirmed that the recent travel boom is really prevalent. The autumn is high and the air is crisp, and there are many people from all countries who go hiking and travel to smoke and haze. Or they are happy to be observed by spies. It is just unlike us who are crammed into a pile in the car, buying first-class tickets and being forced to climb on the foot iron plate with both hands, or shrinking our feet and standing precariously on the "Zhan Tianyou" connecting the two cars. As for the cartels and scalpers, it is simply impossible to talk to them. The situation of us is indeed as I have experienced, and some people have even more bitter experiences. With such travel, it seems that we should also be severely admonished in the future.</p>
<p>But there are still good things about going out. It can let you taste the simplicity and thinness of the folk customs. Let's just say that we had an experience in Suzhou this time. It was already late at night, and we were turned away by three hotels. We wanted to hire a car to Fengmen, but no one was willing to respond. We had to bite the bullet and, after several twists and turns, found a deep alley where my friend Li Gong lived. The door opened, and after asking, I learned that Mr. Li had gone home for the holidays. The neighbor who lived with him actually trusted us and was willing to open the room and let me stay overnight. I am afraid that in Shanghai, ten out of ten families would not be able to do it.</p>
<p>The next morning, my younger brother and I sat in Wu Yuan's "Listening to Rain Pavilion" for a while, and had some snacks. He suddenly had an urgent need to urinate. The two of us dropped our cups and got up, and no one stopped us. I waited on the road until I inquired about a convenient place. I returned after about ten minutes, and the teapot had been refilled. The wooden chair was still empty, and the waiter was not surprised. In Shanghai, they would treat you as if you were eating for free.</p>
<p>It is this, the dilapidated old bridge, the dark and quiet alley, the leisurely comfort, and especially this bit of reasonable human touch, that may make us feel that this place has not completely become a world of beasts.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Essays <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The sale of real estate, such as houses and land, in Ping City (Peiping) has traditionally been of two types: "wealthy" and "urgent funds." "Wealthy" refers to those who have surplus property but lack ready cash, though they are not in dire straits. While they intend to sell, they wait for a good price and are not overly concerned about whether a transaction occurs. "Urgent funds" refers to those who need money immediately (due to funerals or other large expenses), so they dare not speculate and simply aim to sell. However, recently, the number of real estate advertisements in various newspapers has decreased. The few "urgent sales" that do appear usually include the phrase "due to the owner relocating south." This situation implies several things: (1) Those who have real estate, after converting it into liquid assets, cannot find a suitable place to invest it, and also fall into the "reluctant to sell" category, which is why there are fewer properties for sale. (Before the currency reform, rent was calculated in terms of flour sacks, while selling prices were calculated in terms of gold bars. It was openly stated that a ten-room house required thirty-five taels of gold. After the currency reform, gold bars became contraband, and this avenue was closed.) (2) Those who urgently sell their properties do so because the owners are relocating south. The reason for relocating south is the increasingly tense situation in the Northeast and North China. Therefore, although the two mentalities are opposite, the overall cause driving them is the same: the "current situation."</p>
<p>The old capital often had special terms for various "business practices." For example, those who lived off rent were said to "eat roof tiles." Those who made a living by buying and selling secondhand books were said to "eat soft slices" (paper being a soft material). In the late Qing Dynasty, apart from the Manchu-owned mansions, most civilian landlords in Ping City were scribes from various ministries and departments. These people dominated the government offices, manipulating official matters for their own gain. They accumulated considerable wealth and were mostly "old Beijingers," unlike the officials who rotated through positions inside and outside the capital. Thus, they used their money to buy property, providing ample resources for their descendants, who were said to "eat rent," enjoying a generous and stable income, indeed "eating inexhaustibly." After the Republic, the ministry scribes lost power, and property rights gradually fragmented. Most of the mansions of the Manchu nobles passed into the hands of new financial and military magnates. When the national capital moved south in 1928, the populations of political and business circles decreased significantly, and the "roof tile" livelihood suffered a severe blow. At the beginning of the "July 7th" Incident, political circles rushed to the interior, and Ping City became particularly desolate. The Japanese took advantage of this opportunity, occupying or buying vacant houses. Some Koreans and Chinese, relying on the enemy's power, engaged in "roof tile" schemes on a large scale. After a month, as the war spread to villages and towns outside the city, those with some wealth flocked to the city. Enemy nationals and Koreans also arrived in droves, creating a kind of massive "false prosperity." The roof tile business flourished again, but its nature was very different from before. Those buying property were not doing so to invest but to speculate and profit. Landlords either hoarded and extorted rents, or tenants intended to defraud or occupy property. It was completely distorted, with everyone valuing profit above all else. Since the victory, although the enemy has been expelled, the "social ills" they caused are difficult to eradicate quickly. Moreover, with internal troubles arising in the past three years and conflicts occurring in the suburbs, the city's ills have increased rather than decreased. The "roof tile" livelihood is particularly difficult. Renting out empty houses and calculating the value in terms of flour sacks is one method, but "one sack per room" or even half a sack is beyond the ability of tenants to pay. Even if they manage to pay for one or two months, they cannot continue afterward. At that time, the landlord will not receive flour, and if they try to evict the tenant, it is "easy to invite a god but hard to send him away," so they have no choice but to let them live rent-free. If they don't rent it out, not only do they need someone to guard the property, which costs a lot in labor and food, but there is also no doubt that "uninvited guests" (soldiers or bandits) will occupy it, and the owner can do nothing about it.</p>
