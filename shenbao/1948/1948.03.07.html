<h3>羅卓英飛瀋覆命　在平與華北當局有重要決定　關內外軍政經全面配合</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕關內外軍政經濟全面配合，在平已有決定。羅卓英於六日上午十一時離平飛藩覆命。據羅氏談：運日訪晤李主任宗仁，傅總司令作義，楚主席溪春，彼此對東北華北唇齒相依，必須「掌握全面傾注全力」對付共匪一點，皆其同感。華北富局關注東北至切，更堅定了一我們不使東北戰火燒到關內的決一心。至將設華北東北統一指揮機一構一事，中央可能在考慮中，事實上華北東北戰塲已不可分。此次來平，與華北當局除交換軍事意見外，對東北兵源糧食及交通問題，曾廣泛討論，針對共匪之「三求政策」，於充裕糧源，兵糧以及確保交通綫，保障春耕諸點，皆有所決定。記者詢以營口與北寗路及瀋陽與錦州，在目前軍事價值比較，羅氏稱：營口遠較北寗路交通價値爲小。至瀋陽與錦州本有同等軍事價値，惟在目前錦州軍事價値已較前增加。</p>

<p>對於最近發生之和談謠言，陶氏明白指出，此乃民族失敗主義者之一種陰謀。「其用意是準備共產黨再將東北問題用協商方式解決，誘致政府承認它在東北以暴力製造的旣成事實」。陶氏並稱：「如謂和談謠言與東北問題有關，我們就要重申不承認主義，中國愛國人士，特別是東北同胞，已爲不承認主華奮鬥了十幾年，東北領土主權一日不能光復，不承認主義者的奮鬥就一日不馥終止。」</p>

<h3>本能，理智，與民族生命　——中國與族性的比較</h3>
<p>— 雷海宗</p>
<p>本文題目中所講的本匪與理智，並非心理學上的嚴格術語，只是人類常識上的傳統名飼·理智爲一套一套的能自圓其說的道理，持之有故，言之成理，至於與實際關係如何，能否實行·都不在計較之內。本能是根本上不成套的，只是不知其然而然的感覺；但力量甚大，人類大部的行爲，尤其利書攸關的重要行爲，幾乎整個由本能決定。</p>
<p>本文所要談的不是個人，而是民族。民族之間，有的理智發達，有的本能發達。一般講來，理智發達而本能退化的是衰弱的民族；理智無論如何而本能强勁的是生氣勃勃的民族。今日世間本能最强的民族是英國。「國家至上，民族至上」在別國或多或少的總有口號的成分，英國人根本不請此類的話，因爲那是每個英風人的本能感覺，可說是每個英國人的人格的一部。英國是以多出怪人著稱的，各種各類的怪人都有，只有一種非常少見，就是爲一種任何的理論而犧牲國家利益的自圓其說到底的怪人。人世間任何在言謬論，英國都可有人信仰，在平時也可熱烈的研究辯論。但一到緊急關頭，一切理論都可放棄，只有國家的利益不能絲毫損害。外國人時常駡英國人爲僞君子，爲口是心非的人，就是因爲這個道理。其實這是寃枉。今日世間能把人格分爲水洩不通的兩間獨立秘室，一面爲本能，一面爲理智的，只有英國人，別的民族總不能使兩者全不相混。第二次大戰以前幾百年間英國在世界上的主宰地位，就由此而來。</p>
<p>若欲舉例，第二次大戰時期恐怕是最好的機會。在英國，國會議員言論完全自由，在國會中的發言絕對不受任何的制裁或限制；投票也是完全自由的，並不受黨紀的絕對控制。但在英國歷史上不顧大局而濫用此種地位的例幾乎無有。例如在大戰晚期，英國進兵希臘，推行英國傳統的近東政策，到一九四四年年尾希臘內戰爆發，英國迫不獲已而出面千涉。此事在國會中引起大的風波，議員中對政府表示不滿的甚多，所根據的是「民族自決」，「民主」，「自由」，「公道」等等一套一套的理論，但到最後表決時，就近處言，這些議員不願在作戰時期與政府爲難，就遠處言，他們都在心房深處感到國家長久利益的重要，於是有的人不顧前言而投贊成票，有的人爲求在形式上不違前言，或退席，或棄權，讓贊成政府政策的人獲得絕對多數的勝利。這一類的事，在第二次大戰期間屢見不鮮，在幾百年來的英國歷史上也是常事。三百五十年前，歐洲宗敎競爭仍盛的時候，顯馬領袖國的西班牙開無敵艦攻英，英國民族中的少數人信羅馬敎，但絕不爲西班牙所代表的國際主義所誘惑，都無條件的為　國作戰。湛英國海軍高級將領中也有雖　　　，但一般英國人對他們仍表示信任，他們自己也絕不自外，毫無爲理論而犧牲國家的心思。所以英國人的本能勝過理智，並不自最近始，三四百年前已經如此。</p>
<p>我們可以想像任何國家戰敗亡國，而不能想像英國被外來的强力擊滅。我們並非說一定是不可能，而是說不能想像那將是如何的一種景象。一九四〇年納粹滅法蘭西，威脅英國，有隨時渡峽登陸的可能時，當時的首相邱吉爾會在演說中有一段名言：「我們將在海灘抵抗，我們將在田間抵抗，我們將在市街抵抗，我們將在山義抵抗，我們永不屈服！」這不是空話，不是邱氏個人的見解，邱氏在說此言時是最代表英國民族的，這是英國全民的感覺，在抵抗絕對無效而全民仍將赤手空拳戰鬥到底的，我們只能像英國，英國人是生存本能最强的民族，若講口頭禪，可說英國人是最愛國的。但英國人的愛國超過一般所謂愛國，所以典型的英國人向來不講愛國，正如普通的人類很少提到自己的呼吸，走路，或睡眠一樣。那是人格的當然部份，又何必談？又有何可談？</p>
<p>戰後的今日，舊大陸各國，不分戰勝與戰敗，無不百孔千瘡，困難重重。在這所有的國家中，最肯吃苦，最肯不計任何犧牲而求國家的恢復的，就是英國。英國今日一般人的生活，較戰事未了時尙苦，但人民並不怨望，甘心忍受一切，以求把握國家的前途。英國因爲戰時的消耗過重，若以常理而論，英國當與法國一樣的實際成三四等的國家。英國今日之能維持美蘇兩大之外惟一的二等强國的地位，純粹是因爲求生的本能使它肯於拼命苦撑，在人類歷史上這是沒有前例的一種水生本能　發現。</p>
<p>相反的，今日世間本能最爲衰弱；衰顧到幾乎消滅的程度的，就是中國。這並不是說中國理智發達，我們的理智並不發達。但所可驚心的，是稍有理智的人就本能更差，其本能在人格中的地位尙不及一般無知無識的鄉民。除英國外，大概爲理論而犧牲國家根本利益的人各國都有，有的多，有的少，最多的恐怕是中國。許多在西洋本有內容，有眞體含意的說法，移到二中國後，就都變質，成了純粹理論，旣與過去的歷史無關，也與今日的現實無涉，而許多人竟可爲此而犧牲一、切，犧牲自己不算，並要犧牲國家。我們自與歐美接觸以來，就犯這個毛病，病根至今未除。這種行徑，在別國人看起來大槪都根難了解，最感大惑不解的的恐怕是英國人，因為英國人不能想像這是如何的一種心情。</p>
<p>理智是本能的工具，不是本能的主人，推動歷史，支配社會，控制人生的是本能，絕對不是理智，理想家如果認此爲可憾，那也是莫可奈何的。事實是如此，慨噗無濟於事。理智不怕發達，只怕喧賓奪主。只要本能始終居在主位，哩智是愈發達愈好的·但一旦本能退化，弱化，無論理智如何，民族的生命就將危殆。理智與本能的調和，大非易事。英國是世界上惟一理智程度甚高而本能不爲理智所掩的民族，始終沒有爲理論所誤的危險。這樣一個本能爲主的民族可因外力太强而得橫死，而不會自斃。凡是無外力摧殘而有覆亡危險的，一定是本能先死的民族。這是凡欲明瞭歷史，認識現在，長望未來的憂國憂時之士所須時刻不忘的眞理。</p>
<h3>孫副主席返滬　暢談遊臺觀感　臺胞勤奮精神為內地所不及</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕孫副主席科於六日下午三時許由台返滬，旋即接見記者，暢談臺遊觀感稱：台灣各方面所表現安定之情形，有非始料所及者。台省工廠現均絡績恢復，雖因條件不够，未能符合理想，但由各工業機構管理人員所表現之努力精神，彼等殆已對台灣之復興竭盡一切能力。農工復員已使失業問題之嚴重性大爲减輕，人民現均力能維持其生活。關於台省今後建設，無疑應以稻米及蔗糖等主要農產品之增產爲主，而爲達到增產目的，首需解決肥料問題。現在臺煤產量，年約一百五十萬噸，每月供給上海及華南共四萬噸，經濟部以法幣一百五十萬元一噸搜購，而以數倍於此之價格出售，此種政策，實爲剝削台胞，亟應糾正。余認政府機關在台採購物資，應付予公平之價格，才能維持臺胞之購買力。台灣出口物費所得外匯，亦應儘量還之台省，用以充實設備，增加生產。至合胞對於中央，現已完全諒解信任，此實台省政治一大進步，各縣市參議會均吿成立，一切重要問題，均由彼等討論決定，過去官民隔閡之情形，已吿冰消。此外有値得注意者，爲台胞無分男女，自立謀生，勤奮精神爲內地所不及。去年台省征糧成績爲百分之九十八，此守法精神之表現，尤其値得贊揚。台省學齡兒童已近完全就學程度，敎科書亦免費供給，義務敎育之普及，亦足爲內地各省之借鏡。</p>
<p>〔本報台北六日電〕孫科夫婦六日搭班機返滬，魏主席曁各廳處長均至機塲歡送，渠蒞台三週，認爲平生　為　事。</p>

<h3>王副院長廣播　舉辦救濟特捐意義　富人應輸財救人而自救</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕政院副院畏王雲五六日晚八時在中央廣播電台向全國同胞播講「政府爲什麼舉辦救濟特捐」王氏首先申述舉辦救濟特捐之三點意義：第一，是均衡社會財富，和緩社會問題之冲激。第二，是在激發富有者的天良，與勵富有者愛人的美德，一方面救濟苦難同胞於水深火熱之中，另方面發揮人類高尙的同情心。第三，富有者要確保他的身家財富的安全，必須先確保社會的安定。是以舉辦救濟特捐，雖爲救濟難民，實際上亦爲保障社會安全，亦爲保障富人財產的有效方法。於此，氏懇切呼籲富有者擁護政府之決策稱：富人必須具有遠大的眼光，仁者的風度，以自己一部份的錢財，來普濟衆生，來解救衆生的苦難，必須這樣，才能化除社會的不平，消除社會的戾氣，才能貧當相安，各得其所，才能發揚仁者愛人的美德，也才能因輸財救人而獲得自救。</p>
<p>氏繼闡明救濟特捐之用途稱：根據國務會議所通過的嗽濟特捐辦法第二條規定，滬次捐款，以專供辦理救濟事業與賑卹難民之用爲限，這項捐款，誰也無權移作別用的，如有人硬要說政府此次舉辦救濟特捐是爲籌撥軍費，那便是惡意中傷一切勿輕予置售。</p>
<p>關於捐募的辦法，氏亦曾加予說明。氏末稱：最後我再呼籲全國有錢的人，慷慨認捐，多多出錢，更希望各地人民也一致起來，熟烈呼籲有錢的人出錢，並負起督促和鼓勵的責任，務使這一件偉大的捐募工作，迅速成功。</p>
<h3>對夫人購糧圖利說　俞飛鵬辯正</h3>
<p>昨日在漢招待記者</p>
<p>當面斥責市府秘長</p>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕俞部長飛鵬今午邀集各報記者，廣泛答覆有關糧政問題後，並就其夫人購糧岡利之傳說，反復作公開辯正，歷時兩小時之久，綜合俞氏答問如下：</p>
<p>糧政問題</p>
<p>（甲）平抑糧價不能再用拋售辦法，必須參酌供求情形，隨時切實議價，（乙）美糧支配，依中美協定，僅限於五大都市，武漢能否支配，此時尙談不到，仍盼力求自給自足。（丙）五大都市配糧數量，一致按一一〇〇萬人計算，每人一斗，美糧供應四分之二，糧部與地方各供應四分之一，此舉除救濟外，並欲樹立計口授糧基礎。（丁）卅六年度征實結果，平均已達預期數量百分之七十五，其中寗夏，靑海，甘肅等省，因地方安定，成績特佳，均已達百分之九十以上。（戊）武漢糧價暴漲，除春節前後之自然因素外，尙有若千不合理的人爲因素，今後對軍糧收購及糧食轉口，均應梳籌辦理，不容雜亂，尤盼地方政府加强管制，發動春耕，以作治本之圖。</p>
<p>查究傳說</p>
<p>俞氏答順至此，對若干實際問題均無意詳談，而以查究與辯正之口吻，轉入其夫人購糧圖利之傳說，氏稱：「這事關係太太，家之不治，何以國爲，如果眞有此事，我願受法律制裁」，言畢，即請徐市長與孫秘書長說明宣布此一消息之經過，孫氏尷尬謂：「經濟會報時，我是說據報有人假借俞夫人和宋主席的名義，在此購糧岡利，爲了平抑漲風，對這假名招搖者，應予查明究辦，我的意思，是强調懲辦招搖的奸商，而隔天漢口某報即登俞夫人購糧的新聞，未免斷章取義，有意中傷，這一誤會，個人雖無責任，但願向俞部長表示歉意」。</p>
<p>針鋒相對</p>
<p>接着俞氏於請某報記者說明發佈新聞情言，一時針鋒相對，似呈對質方式，徐氏謂：「當時糧價暴漲謠言繁多，市府曾就中糧公司出口糧食加以查考，但並無其他惡意」。最後，俞氏鄭重稱：「這件事，監察院已來查過四次，我也曾電請兩湖監察使及糧部駐漢督導委員和市府當局切實查究，我相信我的夫人是鄉下人，絕對與外間無接觸，而我個人一向抱定做官不做買賣的主張，一生未與商人來往，何來囤糧之事，</p>
<p>依法訴追</p>
<p>總之，這事既為莫須有之事，則孫秘書長以特別市幕僚長的資格，而竟不查明事實，八開詆毀政府首長，實不能不負法律責任，如果三星期以內不能提出具體答復，使此事有個水落石出，便只有依法訴追」。又俞部長午後四時乘粵漢車赴浙。</p>

<h3>五國對西歐盟約草案　原則上獲致協議　條約內未列入軍事條款</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚白魯塞爾六日電〕據此間宣稱，英法荷比荷盧五國六日同意簽訂經濟政治合作條約，其他西歐國家將被邀參加。該條約與若干猜測相反，並未列有軍事條款。觀察家相信軍事條款付閔如之原因，或許在於使條約對其他可能參加國家諸如斯坎的那維亞諸國更富有吸引力。英駐比大使倫特爾宣稱，該條約之條款在比京會議一次即吿究成。一般推崇此約爲英外相貝文所主張之西歐聯盟之礎石，以制止共產主義向西推進。此次條約完成之速，已打破外交史之紀錄，主要原因乃爲各國亟望向本月十五日在巴黎啓幕之十六國會議提出此約。倫氏又說實參加馬歇爾計劃諸國均將接獲參加此條約之請柬。</p>
<p>〔合衆社白魯塞爾六日電〕法代表馬布里稱，除開極權國家所有國家皆得參加此條約，顯然弗朗哥暫時不能參加。歐洲五國會議六日於樂觀和和諧氣氛下進行，此種情形為最近國際會議中所罕見者。長空一碧，春日熙陽，各代表行經比外交部之庭園時，談笑風生，彼等就坐圓桌四周時，仍呈一片欣慰之景象。</p>
<p>〔路透社白魯賽爾五日電〕英外交部幫辦傑勃及法外交部秘書長卓凡爾，為大　所阻，遲至今日始携英法所草之西歐聯盟條約最後草案抵達比京。俟五國代表於六日復會時，將由兩人正式提出。英法所擬取後草案，內容尚未公布，惟據接近英法代表團之人士稱，英法草案與荷比盧之建議，當不難獲致協議，聞英法草案之規定，較荷比盧建議詳盡多多。</p>
<h3>三強同意西德統一經濟　國際管制魯爾區　倫敦會議昨日宣告結束</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦六日電〕美英法三國西德會議歷時兩週，今日宣吿休會，並發表公報，聲明對於國際共管魯爾區，與密切合作登記西德資產列入馬歇爾計劃兩事，已獲協議。據英美兩國發言人稱，關於德國增產計劃「進展良好」。大部份決議案已交還各國首都以待審查，然後當予公佈，料將對於本月十五日巴黎舉行之十六國會議產生重大影響。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕英美法及荷比盧討論西德未來地位之會議，今日實際已吿結束，會議已對德國之聯邦性質與魯爾區之將來國際化，及西德三佔領區劃一經濟政策商得同意。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕南斯拉夫，捷克及波蘭等·三國對倫教西德問題會議所提之抗議，本日已由美國加以駁斥。國務院已將照會送達三國駐在此間之外交代表，照會內容如下：「一九四八年二月廿三日閣下來示，轉下捷波南三國外長最近在普拉格會議中所草擬關於德國問題之宣言內容，余謹奉吿閣下，此項決議內有不少與事實不符之聲明，其內容之討論將無濟於事。」</p>

<h3>蘇英協定有助　馬歇爾計劃　美衆院委會看法</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕衆院援外特委會今日提出之報吿有云，蘇聯經由其英蘇貿易協定，有助於英國地位之改進，因此亦有助於歐洲復興，實爲對於馬歇爾方案之供應。蘇聯之糧食大量流入世界市塲，有助世界復興，亦可因此减輕美國之負擔。</p>
<h3>塔虎脫反對設立　「超理融會」</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕參議員塔虎脫五日對在聯合國外成立「超理事會」以武裝力量應付侵略之建議，表示反對。加上參院主席范登堡之反對，似已將共和黨修正派所提出作爲修正歐洲復興計劃之建議，命運業已決定。</p>

<h3>芬總統草擬對蘇覆文　準備談判訂條約　不願締結任何軍事同盟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播：芬蘭京城廣　稱，芬社會民主黨領袖聲明，共黨企圖煽動工人成迫政府與蘇聯締結軍事同盟，巳爲該黨所擊敗。大部份工人之意見，均與芬議會一致，拒絕與蘇締結軍事同盟。</p>
<p>〔聯合社芬京五日電〕芬蘭總統巴錫維基今日開始草擬對史達林要求締結友好互助條約之覆文。外長恩克爾等重要閣員正與總統商談甚忙，據消息靈通者揣測，芬蘭代表團即可啓程赴莫斯科。</p>
<p>政府此刻將加速進行以便對共黨主使之示威運動，爲先發制人之計。</p>
<p>〔聯合社芬京六日電〕芬蘭議一會六日多數贊成與蘇聯開始條約談判，但反對訂立影響遠大之任何軍事同盟。議會六團體中，僅受共黨支配之人民陣綫集團贊助與蘇訂立軍事同盟，該集團在議會二百席中佔五十一席。史達林總理請與芬締結友好互助條約，若在此約中删去互助條款，將僅爲一文化及友好協定。</p>
<h3>英王及王后　明春將出巡</h3>

<h3>杜魯門總統主持閣議　商討美重大決策　將採取外交主動應付東歐事變</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統今日銷假返京，處理重大決策，即美國應否與西歐締結軍事同盟以抵制蘇聯。總統已定於午後召開閣議，惟此項問題是否列入議程，並未宣布。但西歐五國倘能商定聯防條約，並提出美國參加問題，則美國政策或將於週末有所決定。</p>
<p>同時，義大利局勢迫切，亦不得不顧及。美官方大抵相信今春義大利將爲蘇聯擴展共產勢力於鐵幕以西之目標。軍事援助西歐問題，非正式討論已數月，美國與參加馬歇爾計劃各國軍事聯盟之議，政界及金融界元老巴魯克在數星期前即已向國會提出。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓五日電〕據美京之政界人士稱，最近捷克發生政變蘇聯向芬蘭建議締結同盟，此一連串之事件，影響於國際局勢者頗大。美政府不久將採取外交主動，藉以應付此等變動。消息靈通方面稱，採取外交主動後，將向蘇聯提出暗示性而明確之警告，吿以最近之捷克事件極堪注意，如再將此種政策推行他國，美政府將被迫而改變目前之態度，另行採取他種有效步驟以應付之。杜魯門總統自佛洛利達返來後，今日下午擬與政府閣員進行商談，屆時可決定此項外交主動之一般原則。</p>

<h3>羅哈斯決定全面戡平　菲島農民軍叛亂　據稱該軍與外國有勾結</h3>
<p>〔合衆社駐亞洲副社長房恩馬尼刺六日電〕菲律賓總統羅哈斯六日召集緊急記者招特會，宣佈發動全面戡平胡克黨人（農民武裝叛軍）及全國農民聯盟之戰役。該兩黨正計劃依藉某外國（恐係蘇聯）之侵略以推翻政府·羅氏稱，不能證明不法國體與莫斯科有直接之連絡，除非藉中國共產黨之轉達。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺六日電〕羅哈斯總統今日在記者特別招待會宣佈農民軍與全國農民同盟為非法團體，並稱農民軍共計二千人，農工同盟共計五萬人，均係共產組織。總統復出示該兩團體與世界共產主義勾結之秘密文件，此項文件乃政府軍警與農民軍作戰時所俘獲，內有農民同盟主席卡斯提洛手令多種，曾要求盟員設法暗殺羅氏。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶録（四二）　北美報業聯合會版權所有</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室</p>
<p>無條件投降的有條件運用</p>
<p>無條件投降的原則，蔭蔽了我們對軸心及其衛星國的政策，和我們對他們前途的籌劃。</p>
<p>這個原則本來並不是國務院所想出來的。當一九四三年一月在卡薩勃朗加會議期內總梳在能者招待會中當英國首相面前突然第一次宣佈這個原則的時候，我們很感覺到震驚，如同邱吉爾一樣。有人吿訴我說，當時邱吉爾驚惶失措，愕然無語。</p>
<p>如同我的許多同僚一樣，我根本反對這個原則，有兩種理由。一個理由是這個原則也許會使軸心作困獸之鬥，負嵎抵抗而使戰爭延畏下去。</p>
<p>總統本人在卡薩勃朗加解釋無條件投降這句話的意思說：這並不是毁滅德國，日本和義大利的人民，而是終止以征服別的民族爲基礎的一種理論。然而這句話的本身較之解釋傳揚更廣，以致在納粹宣傳家的手中，就成爲一種工具。</p>
<p>第二個理由是這個原則在遲輯上需要戰勝國家準備接收被征服國家的全國政府和地方政府的每一個部門，並辦理一切政府方面的活動和事業。我們和我們的盟國並沒有準備負起這樣重大的義務。</p>
<p>早在卡薩勃朗加會議之前三年以上，我們在國務院中已開始討論戰後的種種問題，但我們並沒有想到無條件投降的意見。然而總統在卡薩勃朗加說明了這個原則以後，我們沒有辦法，只得至少在形式上遵循這個原則。</p>
<p>一九四三年十二月底，英國大使館交來一個備忘錄，通知我們說：和平的觸角已由德國外交部某一大負和希特勒的警察總長希姆萊經過瑞典而來到英國政府。這觸角的性質是一件聲明，說希姆萊預備派一位陸軍軍官和一位納粹黨員來會見英方代表，想獲悉「無條件投降」這一個名詞的定義。英國人通知我們說：他們的計劃是僅回答說聯合國要求德國的無條件投降，而不再加以進一步的解釋。我們同意這樣的一個答覆。</p>
<p>十二月卅一日在莫洛托夫和哈里曼大使談話的時候，蘇聯也向我們提起無條件投降這個問題來。因此，我和同僚討論之後，於一九四四年一月十四日向總統呈遞一件備忘錄，向他報吿說：莫洛托夫曾自動向哈里曼提及「無條件投降」這句話的定義，並詢問我國政府的態度如何。</p>
<p>我說：「據我所知，蘇聯政府相信對敵國所施的投降條件的一種定義，不論如何廣泛和嚴厲，足以使敵人失去宣傳的利益，因而削弱其軍隊和人民的士氣。鑒於蘇聯對於這一問題的關心，閣下是否將准許我們和蘇聯及英國兩政府討論對各個敵國所施加的無條件投降的各詞，要不要加以一種公開的定義，作爲宣傳上的利用？」</p>
<p>三天以後，即一月十七日，總統以備忘錄一件答覆我，他一開頭就說：</p>
<p>「坦白地說來，我不喜歡解釋「無條件投降」的定義這一套談話的意見。蘇聯·英國和美國已同意決不彼此未經協商而締造任何和平。我以爲每一件事都應照這個原則而決定其利益。」</p>
<p>於是他又繼續說：</p>
<p>我在聖誕節夜演辭詞中所說的話，德國人民一定能聽到了。事賓上，我們並不想到毁滅德國人民，我們願他們世世代代活下去，像歡洲其他的人民一樣，不過有一個條件，就是他們必須消除他們現在的征服思想。我當時所設的話，我巳不能完全記得，但你可以覆查一下。</p>
<p>第二，德國人民和蘇聯也　該明白「無條件投降」的解釋眞正的意義是什慶。（南北　爭時）李氏向葛蘭特投降的故事是圾好的說明。李氏要談各種條件。葛蘭特稱：李氏必須　　　（葛蘭特）的公正。於是李氏就投降了。李氏立即提出南部聯邦同盟軍官的戰馬問題，這些載馬大多數是屬於他們個人的，葛蘭特對李氏說：他們應當把戰馬牽回家去，以備春耕之甩，於是問題就此解決了。</p>
<p>（總統對於美國歷史，有一個很廣博的知識，他曾有一番深刻的研究功夫。但是葛蘭特要求無條件投降，不是在亞彼馬托克斯，而是一八六二年在福特杜納爾遜，當時他接受布克納將軍的投降。）</p>
<p>總統末後稱：『像上面所說的這些小事，對於德國人，其效果更大於蘇聯人，英國人和我們自己想要解釋「無條件投降」而舉行的多次談話。不論我們同意的是什麽字眼，一等到有一個國家要投降的時候，大槪就須加以修改或更動了。」</p>
<p>一月廿五日我把這備忘綠的要點，通知在莫斯科的哈里曼大使。</p>
<p>幾星期之後，蘇聯人和芬蘭人討論議和的時候，俄國人自己就修正了無條件投降的原則。</p>
<p>外交大臣艾登把蘇聯對芬蘭的辦法，作爲向我們提出一個建議的基礎，他建議對於較小的軸心國家，把無條件投降的原則，加以緩和一下。一九四四年三月二十日，英大使哈里法克斯授給我一張由艾登打來的電報，內容就是上面所說的‘電報的日期是一九四四年三月十七日。</p>
<p>五天以後我向總統建議：我們應遵照英國所提議的辦法，以便對於軸心衛星國能得到更大的伸縮性。</p>
<p>當我在等候總統對於這一個建議的回音之時，我接到蘇聯大使葛羅米柯的一件備忘錄，表示他的政府同意英政府和國務院所取的立塲：就是無條件投降的原則應加以修改。</p>
<p>在我有機會把這備忘錄送達總統以前我已接到他對於我三月廿五日的建議的答覆·</p>
<p>他說道，「我想這件事應有不同的處理，據我的判斷，放　「無條件投降」的字　或　它作爲例外，將成爲一種錯誤。事實上，我們的意思欲把這些字眼，向誰運用呢？顯然是我們的敵人　。</p>
<p>『在一九四一年八月成立大西洋憲章的時候和一九四三年一月舉行卡　勃朗加會議的時候，軸心的衛星國是匈牙利，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞和芬蘭。他們雖則也是我們的敵人，但與德義兩國的意義不同。這四個小衛星國是在　義强迫之下成爲我們的敵人。</p>
<p>「我以爲作爲例外是一個錯誤。義大利是無條件投降的，但同時獲得了不少特別權利。如果保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，匈牙利或芬蘭實行投降，也應這樣。李氏向葛蘭特無條件投降，但葛蘭特立即對他說：他的軍官應把他們的戰馬牽向家去作春耕之用。我要在海外看到的也是這種精神，但這種精神不適用於德國。德國只知道一種言語。　羅斯福。』</p>
<p>收到了總統的覆文以後，我的同僚中有幾位用備忘錄向我建議，請我再與羅斯福提出這問題。經過了一番討論之後，我於四月四日寄給總統一封信。</p>
<p>這時候總統因患着厲害的氣管炎而躺在白宮的牀上，我不能和他親自談話。因此就有一連串書面的通話。</p>
<p>總統在第二天答覆了。他說，「我完全明瞭這個問題，但我無論如何要防避被人說無條件投降的原則已經放棄。如果在一個特種情形發生之前，我們對於一般的原則開始有例外，那末其中將有眞正的危險。</p>
<p>「我們都知道：如果我們對於以後將在一切情形中運用的原則，作成任何例外，那末這危險必將發生。</p>
<p>「我完全明瞭以後隨時必有例外，不是投降原則的例外，而是在特種情形中運用投降原則的例外一這和改變原則是完全不同的事。</p>
<p>「如果蘇英兩政府通知我有這種情形，那末我確定我們將同意它們。這一點應向這兩國政府說明的。那時候它們就不能指責我們使蘇聯的軍事任務更爲困難。　羅斯福。」</p>
<p>但這個問題不會熄止的。僅僅兩天以後，從另一方面，即軍事方面，這問題又被引起來了。一九四四年四月十三日我接到那時在倫敦的副國務卿史坦蒂紐斯的電報，他把艾森豪威爾元帥和艾帥的參謀長史密斯將軍向他所提的建議，轉交與我。史坦蒂紐斯說，這兩位將軍曾和他提出這問題，並發表他　　愼的意見。認爲我們應宣佈黝職敗後的鵝團如何　遇的原則，蘿以關明無條件投降的意義。</p>
<p>我把這對電報寄給總統，那時他正因小病而在南卡洛林納州喬治鎮巴魯　莊上休養。</p>
<p>四月十五日我接到總統的一個簡短的消息，其中提及四月十三日史坦蒂紐斯的電報後說：「對於這電報的任何答覆須有我的核准以後方可寄出。」</p>
<p>四月十七日我打電報給費里普，請他通知一切有關的人：總統希望對這個問題，沒有他一的同意，不再予以進一步的考慮。</p>
<p>總統於五月七日返歸華盛頓，我在三天以後，把關於這一問題的備忘錄一件，送達總統。我說：國務院已得到英大使館的通知，說明英政府認爲盟國實行對衛星國的宣傳是很重要的。這種宣傳，特別是對匈牙利和保加利亞，今後應刪去「無條件投降」的名詞，以便在加强對德抵抗中，獲得最高限度的軍事利益。對於總原則將避免放棄。</p>
<p>我說，「在提出這個建議的時候，英大使館指出蘇聯政府對芬蘭並未運川這原則，如果羅馬尼亞照着他們投降的建議而停戰的話，那末蘇聯政府對羅馬尼亞也可以不遝用這偭原則。一般推想宣傳機關在籌擬它們的指令的時候，將考慮到這些問題。關於匈牙利和保加利亞，國務院認爲在這個時候對宣傳工作採取有力的行動，確能得到益處。所以我很感激，如果你育表明是否將准許我們和英蘇採取平行的行動，對於宣傳，特許若干自由行動。一</p>
<p>總統把這備忘錄寄還給我，上面寫了「ＯＫ」的字樣。</p>
<p>三大盟國領袖迭次發表的聲明，緩和無條件投降的解釋，但並不能使德國提早投降。納粹的宣傅機構繼續到底，强調其對無條件投降的硬性解釋。</p>
<p>如果沒有宣佈無條件投降的原則，或聯合國所同意和聲明的條件較爲寬大，那末德國是否較早就投降，這仍是一個問題。</p>
<p>無諭如何，對德國繼續運用無條件投降，確有這樣的效果：就是將來的德國宣傳機構決不能再像一九二〇年代和一九三〇年代那樣自稱：德軍並未戰敗，德國的戰敗是由於後方民政管理和人民的衰弱。</p>
<p>至於我們東方的敵人日本，在三個月後，當她看到無條件投降的原則能加以有條件運用的時候，也就投降了。（完）</p>

<h3>參議大會昨夜結束　房租倍數訂定通過　照廿六年加七千倍與九千倍兩種　本月實行半年調整一次</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議　首屆第五次大會，此次舉行會議共十二天，於昨日上下午分別舉行第十第十一次會議後，至晚上九時半始吿圓滿閉幕。此次大會中對於市民最關切之議案，除節約用電罰款業於日前決議取消外，房租問題；亦已於昨日大會中討論，歷一小時半後，獲得解決辦法。決議數點：（一）市參議會決定應定一房租最高額。（二）其最高額爲：營美房租按民二十六年增加九千倍，住宅房租爲七千倍。（三）上項辦法，自本月份起實行，六個月調整一次。（四）公敎人員房租不再以八折計算，一律按新訂額辦理。房租問題決定後，房捐亦得以解決，經決議：（一）房捐按房租實收數向房東征收。（二）稅率仍按原稅最高額住宅用爲房租百分之五，營業用百分之十徵收。</p>
<p>按上項房租最高額，乃由徐副議長根據前訂房租一百八十倍及一百四十倍爲基礎，加上五十倍而訂，即按民二十六年房租加九千及七千倍。換言之，戰前營業房租十元者現爲九萬元，住宅用者現爲七萬元。當討論時，發言之參議員全不贊成「按生活指數」定標準，但多數贊成應訂一標準。馮有眞，何成甫根本不主張規定房租標準。李文杰，姜屏藩，朱文德，馬少基，王維　等表示根據房屋租賃條例請將此案送回市府，因市府送請市參議徽求同意，市參議會如不同意，則送回請予重訂，參議會無權定標準。然多數參議員認爲有權訂定。同時所謂「標準」二字並不合理，經詢問祝局長後，亦答「標準」乃「最高額」之誤。參議員贊成訂最高額者甚多，但各人提出倍數不同，張中原主張四千至八千倍，施宗德主張五千至一萬五千倍，戰前房租不滿十元者，爲三千至六千倍，襲夏定三千五百倍。而馮有眞，費樹聲，贊成按一月份房租凍結，江浩然主張按十二月份房租凍結。吳市長即席建議，組織一委員會，於閉幕後討論，尤須訂出一制裁二房東不合理之取利辦法，但未爲大會所同意。結果如陶百川，楊公庶等均贊成副議長意見，經表決後通過。</p>
<h3>掌聲一片　擁護祝平　警告案立刻撤銷</h3>
<p>〔本　訊〕房租問　昨當參讓大會決定後，地政局長祝平特正式表示同意可作市政府提出者。並謂以後決定切實執行，如執行有困難，可由法院主持。若再不能辦好，則願自請處分。（言畢在塲參議員一致熟烈一再鼓掌），而參議員唐世昌等原有提案，擬對「罔顧大衆利益之地政局局長祝平，由本會予以警吿」，至此立即聲明撤回，並有參議員請改撤銷爲擁護，引起哄堂大笑，而警吿案則決定撤銷。</p>

<h3>兩參議員　一塲糾紛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市參議會上午舉行會議前，瞿鉞與鍾玉良二參議員，忽因言語衝突，幾至動武，幸經議長·副議長勸解，致未擴大事態。綠日前有高橋區民二千人聯合要求　免　氏，瞿氏已在前日各報，發表談話。昨日遇見高橋區長　玉良時，詢以：「高橋區民罷免我，你是區長，何以不早吿訴我」？鍾答以「想你做參議員做得好不過，所以要罷免你『。瞿聞言，怒氣益盛，鍾又大聲謂：「請你在會塲守秩序！」瞿謂：「現在還未開會，並非會塲」。雙方相持不下，瞿鉞又衝向前說：「我現在巳改在洋涇區，高橋區民不能罷免我」，錘亦不肯示弱，謂：「偏要罷免你，又怎樣？」此時議長等在旁，出任排解，一塲糾紛，始吿消散。</p>
<h3>趙曾玨表示倦勤　吳市長懇切慰留</h3>
<p>市公用局長趣曾玨，前以時會艱鉅，措施困　，心力交瘁，迭向吳市長提出亂呈，以讓賢路。。吳市長以趙氏兩年餘來，掌理本市公用事業，任勞任怨，積極推進，甚著成效，除一再批示挽留外，並已而予懇切慰留。</p>
<h3>電請美國政府　實施全面援華　譯就電文將於今晨發出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會前日大會決定電美國政府請求實施全面援華之電稿，業經譯成英文，將於今晨發出，其原電云：『美國杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務鄉，參衆兩院議長，曁外交委員會，撥款委員會，軍事委員會諸位先生：中國政府阻遏共黨叛軍勢力之蔓延，乃爲維持國際正義世界和平之戰爭，亦爲維護中國獨立自由所不能避免者。蓋惟有獨立自由和平統一之中國屹立於遠東，不爲極權的共產主義席捲而去，而後世界人類之和平幸福與太平洋兩岸民主自由之生活方式，方可免於破壞。惟自中國政府與人民於對日長期抗戰之後，國力疲憊，民生困苦，目前正處於嚴重局勢之中，不能不有望於貴國之緊急援助。而當前中國問題，確如麥克阿瑟元帥及魏德邁將軍所云，只有軍事問題，故貴國必須於經濟援華而外，特別加强軍事援助，方克有濟。假使中國剿共軍隊所必需之軍火及糧秣服裝等，均能因貴國之源源濟助，而不必牽動國家之經常預算，吾人敢信不特中國共產主義勢力之撲滅，必可早日吿成，即通貨膨悵之趨勢亦可停止，國家經濟不難望其恢復平衡。同時吾人必當發揮民意，監督政府，以促內政改革之積極進行，與貴國援華之行動相配合。救病救火，均須及時，吾則藥不對症，或水力不足，固不足以解待救者之困阨也。中國目前急盼貴國之軍事援助，與經濟援助，正復如是，本會謹代表上海五百萬市民向貴國作誠摯之呼籲。上海市參議會議長潘公展副議長徐寄廎三月六日。』</p>
<p>市長赴各區米號觀看配米品質。　（本　攝）</p>
<h3>市長出巡　關懷民食　查問各區配米情形　楊樹浦區辦理成績最佳連聲贊好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長對本市全面配米事甚爲車視，特於昨晨偕同民食調配主任委員任顯羣，民政局長張曉崧及新聞處長等赴各區巡視。晨八時半自市長官邸出發，首至靜安區區公所，區長金德寰報吿上半月證皆已分發，經查驗領據簿册無誤。</p>
<h3>敲門訪住戶　主婦正梳洗　連稱對不起</h3>
<p>即由金區長陪同至常德路趙家橋路十二保，由市長向余渭昌官　增坊，義昌肉莊等抽查詢問，居民多稱已領得購米，市長又囑出示配米看後，問以「米質好不好」？該項配米爲潔白西實米，居民　回稱「好」。繼至常德路協大公米號查問發售配米情形。又向二八一號居戶敲門詢問，是否領得配證，該戶主婦方起身梳洗，市長述稱「對不起」，經詢明亦已領得配證，乃囑快於十二日前憑證至米店購米。</p>
<h3>大馬路穿梭訪問</h3>
<p>一行繼至老閘區公所，由區長李汝椿陪同，先至新新公司，該公司猶未開門營業。乃穿越至對面久豐綢緞局詢問，答稱已領得配證。該綢緞局經理見市長親出調查，連稱「勤政愛民」，「賢明市長」不止。繼至隔鄰盛錫福帽廠及樹仁堂華號詢問，該二戶尙未領得配證，市長囑速向保長催領。繼又於人進中穿越馬路至對而泰康餅乾公司及大光明鐘表眼鏡總行詢問，皆已領得配證。繼自勞合路步行折至西藏路查看附近同昌米發經售情形，時門前特證購米之市民甚踊躍，市長驗看陳列樣米與售予市民之米無誤，即欣然辭出。驅車直駛舊市中心新市街區，該區區晨蔡福山報吿配購證已發予百分之五十二居民，並陪同至馬玉山路楊家浜鎭視察，市長向居民一一詢問。</p>
<h3>配米售完　市長滿意</h3>
<p>繼又至楊樹浦區，該區配在情形最好，配證皆已發完，多數米店門前書有「配米售完，臨到再賣」字樣。市長對該區認爲滿意，連連稱好。後因聞提籃橋區居民多未領得配證，又驅車至該區區公所調查，經查驗簿册，見各保長多方將配購證領去，尙有五保則迄未領證。吳市長連聲叮囑區公所辦事人員應將此事當作最軍要事情做，以後應加注意，不可疏忽。並至該區第一保辦公處蔣喬興壽器店視察，囑保長速將證發出。</p>
<h3>希望市民　公開檢討</h3>
<p>巡視至此時已十一時三刻，因須出席市參議會，乃吿中止。吳市長表示：三月份配米因係　辦，困難及缺點在所不免，相信四月份辦理時當可進步多多。渠希望市參議會決定成立之區政調查團平日成立，至各區督促配米。市府社會局及民食調配會所有同人應在住所附近儘量督促保甲長，　望市民公開檢討。渠今後並將與美方中華救濟團長吉美德等隨時至各區巡視，加緊督促。</p>
<p>據任主委吿記者稱：下半月之配瞄證，民食調配會定八日前發交各區公所轉發。</p>
<h3>短少斤餘斤米　澈查是否舞弊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南米市場所屬承售計口配米之　萊區第二第八兩組，前日向中信局太古棧房出米三五四九包，分發各經售米號銷售。發現每二包缺少一市斤半，共少一七四四市斤。按照規走，由承運米行賠償。昨該米行向民食調配會申訴，並派員向食庫交涉，食庫方面認爲貨已過磅離庫，當時未有指出缺少斤量，故不承認。據悉：當局對此項情事甚爲注意，巳派員澈查，將請中信局公佈太古樓　進倉出介數字，並將會同開倉鎖倉，以待儲米出完後查看有者多餘，俾證明是會舞弊。</p>
<h3>議長致休會詞　頌揚大會精神　對事不對人為民主政治基礎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參鑽大會昨夜舉行休會儀式，行禮如儀後，由主席潘議長致休會詞，略謂：此次大會，同人對各重要問題，均能盡心盡力討論，得有相當結果，雖因時間匆促，有若干提案未能處理完善，但同人之精神很可自慰。本會最後所討論之房租最高額，亦巳得到合理解決，雖執行時將來或有困難，但相信政府可盡力貫澈之。此外市府所訂之工廠設廠地址及劃區等案，亦非常重要，對於都市前進與目前工業均有密切關係，故特別交付都市計劃會及工務委員會寨查，可見對於市民有關案件，決不敢疏忽草率決定。又公用事業部門，公用事業雖因一再漲價而引起許多批評，但相信此種批評係對事而決非對人，觀於房租問題案對地政局長終於瞭解一點，即可證明。故對趙局長亦如此。用電超限罰款制度，亦因得主管當局合作因而取消。如此類事項，雖未能完成顧到市民，但至少亦可解除或减少市民一部份痛苦。再關於治安方面，亦能在目前經濟困難情形下成立營備旅，其他各部決議不再贅述。</p>
<p>總之，希望同人永久能以此次大會之精神自勉，即「對事而不對人」，這就是眞正民主政治之基礎。討論時儘量批評，而對方應以寬宏大量來聽，執行時則須拋棄個人成見而服從參數人之決定。這種精神盼　發揚光大。</p>
<p>對於國際方面，本會巳有電文致美國朝野，美國朝野向來重視中國人民之意見，則相信必能尊重本會意見。</p>
<p>吳市長表示希望</p>
<p>吳市長到處詞稱，參議會中能公關，批評，實是最好現象。因公開，批評，而能改善，此三者實爲辦事之精神。最近三月來市府尤須公開者爲戶口配米制度，今晨至各區視察，相當滿憲，但仍嫌若干處辦事遲緩。市長最後希望參議會協助市府，監督市府，則市政必能完滿。同時市府同人願追隨各位公開及批評之精神，做到民主政治的模範。</p>
<p>陶百川感到進步</p>
<p>參議員代表陶百川致詞，略謂五次大會結束，使本人感到參議大會一次比一次進步，（一）人力比前增加，民靑兩黨參議員加入後，代表人民利益在大會中共同商討提案而不以政黨立塲參加，此種賢明態度實爲本會成功，而本會因此聲勢擴大，更可爲人民服務，協助政府。（二）此次大會質詢都用口頭而非書面，亦為一特色。（三）本會組織人權保障委員會，爭取人民自由，平等生命保障，對於軍警人格本會非常尊重，即因愛之深而望之切。（四）房租問題因徐副議長之動議而得解決。雖然對於少數房東利益减少，但希望他們能以保障大多數人民利益着想。</p>

<p>當討論該案時，虞如品參議員報吿昨日下午渠所開設之南貨店內，忽來經濟警察數人，强行搜查，抄出其大人所戴金鐲二只，及二年前友人借黃金所出之收據，即指爲違法證據，雖經虞聲明係參議員，即須赴會，但警察堅欲將虞逮捕。後經電吿俞局長，雖經全局長通知撤去，警察仍不理會。虞以警察對參議員猶如此，對於一般小民更不堪設想，要求主持公道。同時潘議長亦報吿其　接得虞之電話後，即在電話　中呌警察剛去，並吿知對方，本人係參議會議長，歷十次之多，且吿以市參議員除現行犯外，在會期內非得市參議會之許可，不得逮捕或拘禁。對方仍推說聽不出，並稱不知道議長係何人。後經申斥，並謂將吿由市長處分，始悉離去。全塲參議員聞悉後，均極表憤慨，要求市長澈查嚴辦。市長當即保證激查究辦。</p>

<h3>雙槍王八妹　到杭州</h3>
<p>局長梁强，視察杭州工程處的公路，壽昌先生和我參加了這個行旅，由紹典轉往乍浦，已是暮色蒼茫的時候，我們投宿在海風旅館，那是息浦最上等的宿店房屋寬大，不過陣設稍嫌簡單罷了。我問茶房：此地有位王八妹女士住在那裏？他說就是這個個旅館的老闆。我想一訪這位抗戰中　傳奇人物，但茶房吿訴我：她到平湖去</p>
<p>〔本報杭州五日訊〕去年盛夏，有一位海寗靑年團的書記林朝果先生跑來吿訴我，他們十區靑年團聯誼會到乍浦開過會，碰見雙槍王八妹，她是如何的好客，如何的豪俠。他又說，他可以介紹我到午浦去看她，而且他還可以陪我去。</p>
<p>旅館主人　傳奇人物</p>
<p>去年秋初，第一區公路　局了。去年冬初，壽昌，安娥，張瑞芳，應雲衛諸位，從上海經乍浦來杭看我，他們說爲了想拍攝望海潮的電影，已經確見過王八妹了，說她豪爽坦白而熱情，又說她是個矮矮的個兒，長得很結實，帶銅色的皮膚，一望而知是經過風霜的。</p>
<p>部下勇敢　敵人寒心</p>
<p>王八妹，有人說她在戰前是保護鹽船的，後來戰爭起來了，她就組織游擊隊，和日敵作戰，當然，她的武器不够，錢不够，但是她　部下個個都很勇敢，眞正打死過日本鬼子。將勝利的前一剎那，她還統率一個護航總隊，下設三個大隊，九個中隊。她出沒在江浙兩省的海濱河沼，活躍在江南的土地上，使日敵感到頭痛和煩惱。有許多故事，講起來是甚爲神奇的。譬如像海風旅館裏的茶房吿訴我們。黃總隊長有一天被很多敵人包圍了，她一蹲身，袖出兩支手槍，拍拍的幾聲響，終於打死了幾個敵人，　其餘的敵人嚇跑了。</p>
<p>不久以前，報紙上登着王八妹的部屬　變而逃入海口與四明山區取得了通絡，但在不久以後，工八妹出來聲明，否認有這一回　實，並指出那些奸徒決不是她的部屬。</p>
<p>戎馬倥　朝山進香</p>
<p>她的麾下，原有很多娘子軍。但在勝利以後，出嫁的出嫁了，回家的回家了，她的部隊自從勝利以後，把三個大隊緊縮爲一個大隊，　將一個大隊改編爲保警中隊，編餘的悉充各鄉鎭的常備隊。其餘遣散的官兵”大半經商的經商，種　的種出了。她自己呢，在乍浦開了一爿海風旅館開了幾個鋪子，在黃山風景區又築了一所酒排間，在乍浦鎭上，創辦了一所可容三百餘學生的完全小學校，又替風雨中的行船條養了江邊的燈塔。</p>
<p>她虔誠信佛，雖在八年抗戰戎馬倥　　，也必朝山進香，現在她　要是頂　膜拜菩　了。</p>
<p>丁匪錫山　佈置情形</p>
<p>最近，王八妹到杭州來了，同時也來了平湖縣長。沈主席接見了她，而且又宴請她，保安副司令竺鳴湊也宴請了她。據她說：這一次來是燒香的。據省政府的人說，沈主席到平湖去的時候，曾經問起她過，這回她來拜見沈主席的。主席宴請她是一種禮貌的表示。和八妹談起丁錫山的事情，她說，起先有不少万徒來佈置，並向勞苦　衆煽惑，要他們參加「鬥爭」。丁錫山頂定也想在平湖的金山衛登陸的，後來臨時變更計讀，才在奉賢登陸。上海警備司令部早已復知這個情報了，我也奉召到上海出席聯席會議過了。」</p>
<p>一個女兒中學唸書</p>
<p>王八妹現在是平湖縣的縣參議員，她其實姓黃，名字改過為百梅，現在又改爲百器。她有一個女兒，已經十六歲了，在平湖中學唸書。相傳她還有一位了不起的女衛士，能够背着她泅水，而且能够雙毛放槍。</p>
<p>據張瑞芳和安娥吿訴我：黃女士也是相當風趣的人，她有一變平底而相當　登的黑皮鞋，在她的　房中，也有香肥皂和雪花膏。她的居處還有一間佛堂，而是傍海倚山一間淸潔明朗的屋子。</p>
<p>沒有學問只會放槍</p>
<p>她常常謙遜的說：」沒有學問，祇會放放槍。」然而，在她的生活歷程中的一切經騐，又豈是在書本上可以學習得來的學問。</p>
<p>現在，她又離開杭州回到乍浦去了，不禁令我想起這瀕臨在海邊上的重鎭，那裏殘留着遜淸時破敗了的砲壘，那裏是軍事上的要地，是孫中山先生計劃中的東方大港，我們熱望多有幾位熱情豪爽如黃百器女士那樣的人、，使乍浦繁榮茁壯起來！</p>

<h3>金色的澳門</h3>
<p>此間黃金市場的存在，造成了今日國內一個最大的經濟漏洞。一般人們只知道有香港而忽略了澳門，便造成了澳門畸形的發展。</p>
<p>〔本報香港四日航訊〕在中國的大地上，有這樣的一塊地方，每天有不少人，每人携帶黃金十兩，獲得海關正式的允許，不斷的跑進國內去·這裏國內和國外之分，祇是一度「關閑」，出了「關閘」，通過海關，（拱北關）便是進了國內。在國內找一處地方放下那十兩黃金，你儘可回頭跑回國外，又把十兩黃金正正當當地帶進國內來，這裏的關員就算看熟了你的廬山，他也不會把你的黃金沒收，或把你送進拘留所。在這個地方，你每次把十兩黃金由國外帶進國內是不犯法的，因此，只怕你的本錢不够，不愁你發財不成。這裏是廣州，漢口·甚至上海的黃金供應所，這是政府官方途徑以外，人民把黃金運進國內的唯一正常辦法，也可以說當前國內金融市塲上的一個</p>
<p>方便大門，這兒便是——廣東中山縣最南端和香港隔海四十哩的澳門。</p>
<p>自上海香港相繼禁止黃金進出口後，澳門一躍而爲今日遠東的一個黃金市塲。墨西哥黃金，美國貢金，源源經過馬尼刺，由飛機運抵渙門，復由渙門運進國內。據海關方面保守的估計，每天由澳門內運的黃金，至少平均有一千兩，大規模走私的尙未計算在內。現有很多商人，由澳門買進黃金，運往漢口去，然後買了華中出產，經粵漢路運回來，聽說獲利頗可觀。澳門金市用的是老秤，漢口用的是新秤，每十兩黃金，便多了兩兩，這兩兩便成了他們穩得的利潤。</p>
<p>據經濟界方面調查，香港和澳門至少各有一個華資銀行，在美國存有鉅額美元，作爲輸入黃金用途。牠們把黃金由美國運來渙門，便立刻在香港用種種方法，搜購相等價値的</p>
<p>美元外匯，民補充在紐約方面的存款。澳門黃金輸入無窮，而港中美元外匯（多來自歸國華僑，遊客支票，來港美軍人士和上海富豪）有限，因此，港中美元黑市日高，金價亦隨之上揚。　澳門因黃金市塲的存在，現已成爲今日國內的一個最大經濟漏洞。一般人們最初祗知有香港而忽略了澳門，便迭成了澳門這個畸形的發展。最近，總我海關副總稅務司丁貴堂訪澳之後，中央銀行財政顧問羅傑士和中央銀行代表余英傑又由上海趕到澳門去，和澳當局商談一個相類於中港協定的中澳協定。受了</p>
<p>黃金滋養的澳門，現已從戰後的衰弱中漸漸地復原。澳門政府一面加抽金市塲的營業稅和徵收五百萬元的保證金，一面發仃新葡幣收回舊葡幣，因此銀根吃緊，適逢美匯上升，遂使港幣在澳門，最近每元祗値葡幣七角九分，（平時差不多平換）—港商「飼養」澳門，反給澳門一口反噬，呼痛也來不及！二月廿日發表的本年度澳門政府預算，共計一一·一六二·六〇五元，比較去年度的八·七〇九·〇一八元，幾增百分之三十，可爲渙督柯維納宣稱：「本澳社會一切及商業繁榮上，業已獲極大之轉機」一語的註釋。</p>
<p>黃金市塲的存在，把澳門推進一個新階段。記者願借這篇短稿之末添上一句話：盼望國內人民不要祗知有香港而淡忘了澳門！（本報特約記者子健）</p>
<h3>杭市發生　徵丁怪事　妻子拐賣丈夫</h3>
<p>代價一千二百萬元</p>
<p>〔本報杭州五日訊〕杭市近發生妻子拐賣丈夫之怪事，轟動遐邇。被賣者名馬繼生，業人力車夫，年四十歲，原籍紹興，住拱宸橋福海里二弄五號，娶妻馬高氏，原一再醮婦，面目甚醜而淫蕩不堪，平時即與附近三八醬油廠中小工王蓮靑發生噯味，後又與南星橋一綽號　子木匠有，實行同居。馬生性庸懶，平日只須老酒到手，即百事不管。廢曆年初十，高氏忽邀馬至南星橋石劍飛家飲酒，馬即與隣友李阿毛同往，旋吿失蹤，後經李苦善其母及其弟坤生，始悉馬已被高氏串通姘夫王　靑賣與石劍飛充作壯丁，代價國幣一千二百萬元，高氏得九百萬，石分得三百萬，其　即報吿刑警隊，將高氏·石等拘獲，現正嚴鞫中。</p>
<h3>吳縣一鎭長　賄放中籤壯丁　撤職查辦</h3>
<p>〔本報吳縣五日訊〕城區金　鎭長曹子衡，於卅七年度第一期緊急征兵時，以每名三五千萬代價，濫事賄放中籤壯丁，頃被人向吳縣團管區司令部檢舉，經該部軍法室拘案，審訊屬實，交三家殷實舖保及二千禽元現金保暫釋，全案移吳地檢處，依法偵辦，頃縣府已下令撤職。</p>
<h3>山西紀行（二）兵農合一</h3>
<p>〔本報太原二日航訊〕在綏靖公署的會議室裏，屏門上寫着：「以恕道處人即能服人，以中道處事即能成事」，還有一聯：「中乃治事之極則，得中則存，失中則毁」。那末說今日閻將軍在山西的處事，治事，多以「中」爲其思想理論的出發點，該不會錯。同時，匪共今日不外乘着政府的作爲不能盡如人意的政治缺陷，與貧富生活過份懸殊的經濟漏洞兩個空隙而猖獗，這種客觀環境也足以使他從「中」字裏找出路。閻將軍很簡單的解釋說：「現在國家要兵，人民要生活，能得到一個中道的辦法，就可以兩面顧到。」於是在晋西抗戰時提出的「兵農合一」在今天就更顯得積極。</p>
<p>新時代井田制度</p>
<p>「兵農合一」，實在就是新時代的「井田制度」，是打破了「土地集中」和「土地使用分散」的矛盾，澈底挽救數百年來已瀕於破產的農村的革命制度。同時，也使徵兵制度有了一個絕對保障。</p>
<p>「兵農合一」內容中最主要的是劃分份地，不像匪共的殘殺地主沒收土地，或發行公債收買土地，只是　和規定了一兩糧銀一石租（一兩糧銀約合田八——十二畝，按產量分七等卅一級，重新平均）由地主保持所有權，幾民取得使用權，政府管理分配權。以前農民向地主繳納田租，每畝竟達七斗至一石一斗之巨，雖則現在的一兩糧銀一石租，仍好算是一種剝削，還不能收到像國父所說的耕者「有其」田，而僅是耕者有田「種」而已，但這種部份地實現了「平均地權」，在未盡適合地方環境前，似亦難能可貴了。</p>
<p>份地標準與編組</p>
<p>份地的標準，以每兩個農工能耕好的畝數爲一小份，分給一個士兵及農人（常備兵，補充兵，國民兵），由他本人及家屬共同耕紜，家屬勞力不足，當另編助耕，以一個農工的收益能養四口人爲原則，爲了今後　利集體機械耕作的到來，在劃地時把六小份地合成一份大份地。在這個基礎上，將來可以歸併勞力從事工業的生產建設。其次是編組優待，六個十八至四十七歲的男丁自願的編爲一組，每人領一小份地，一人服常備兵役，三年轉換；一人服補充兵役，有戰事出征；四人服國民兵役，兩個國民兵優待一個常備兵，兩個國民兵優待一個補充兵。就是常備兵和補充兵入營以後，份地處理辦法由人民自行選擇：（一）助法——帮工，（二）徹法——分糧，（三）貢法——出糧包種，（四）折法——以糧折工。這樣，常備兵補充兵每人至少可以得到糧食六石，（米，麥），棉花十二斤。</p>
<p>地主得到一兩糧銀的一石租，嚴格說還是「不勞而獲」，因此要　十分之二的累進救濟糧，對老弱無養的施以救濟。此外對於國民必修敎育和國民兵民主政治更可以從頭做起。</p>
<p>喊出九好四沒有</p>
<p>「兵農合一」裏的份地，是久恒性的，「有恒產者有恒心」，誰多好好地種；每一個編組　要互助互保，助工和糧花，保不通匪不潛逃。細則裏規定的事項更詳盡，關將軍常以此自豪：「山西省現在是種田的人多，當兵的人多·」於是他喊出「九好」「四沒有」。「九好」是：（一）當兵的有優待。（二）種地的有够種的土地，勞動結果私有。（三）負担公平。（四）老弱有救濟。（五）敎育機會均等。（六）是非平等。（七）生活平等。（八）國民兵有久業。（九）常備兵有恒產。」「四沒有」是：「沒窮人，沒閑人，沒壞人，沒愚人？」　現在晋中區十九市縣耕地面積約八百四十萬畝，除接近匪區的山地外，已劃分了二〇二，八九二份，今年預計增加四萬份。</p>
<p>兵農合一實騐區</p>
<p>記者團曾去太原西南郊的晋祠參觀了當地的「兵農合一實驗區」。這一塊周成王桐葉封地的古蹟勝地，唐槐，周柏，蒼　勁遒，呌人懷古幽思油然而生，淸可見底的難老泉，在這終日黃沙滾滾的大平原上，不失爲一個異樣的安慰。</p>
<p>民衛軍在操塲上正操得緊張，我們分頭　進了這座小鎭，找着民衆作深入的探詢，極參數的窮光蛋，佃農今天多爲了生活有了久恒的着落而拉開嘴笑了，他們說以前種田年年要向地主磕顯求拜；沒有衣穿，更沒有　餘的糧，甚至討不到老婆，今天大家多是門當戶對了。有幾個地主，看上去就知道是强顏歡笑。爲了羣衆，就不得不犧牲小我利益。君不見以前太原警備司令和砲兵司令的晋祠別墅裏的亭台樓閣，而今只剩了些殘磚頺垣，千百畝的肥田也成了份地，得之於民的，今天仍然還之於民！（本報記者楊文育）</p>

<h3>市參議員建議　老閘區中心國民校　擬以格致中學改辦</h3>

<h3>交大訓育新方針　養成學生知恥習慣　懲戒處分不予公告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通大學頃製定訓育新方針，規定今後學生違犯校規，應受處分者，一律不予公告。由校以通知單分別寄交家長及保證人，另以一份由訓導員面交受懲學生，並予剴切訓導，其有因事關學生全體應公佈以資警惕者，亦僅佈告事由，不予書明姓名，藉以養成學生知恥習慣，導使學風日趨於淳正。該校就此新訓育方針，闡示其意義如下：「查學生就學期間，應以砥礪品行爲第一要義，而砥礪品行，又以知恥爲最要。上焉者恥不爲聖賢，中焉者亦恥事功之不如他人，下焉者則行爲不檢，亦諱莫如深，惟恐人知。凡此皆知恥之良知，雖賢愚顯然有別，　其爲知恥則一。學校訓練學生，對於不知恥者則激發之，對於知恥者則涵養之，未有養成無恥之習慣，而能達敎育之目的者也。前淸舊習，於校庭縣虎頭脾，下懸軍棍，凡學生有犯規情事，則將處分及情由書於虎頭脾上，公佈示衆，大抵情做照法院公會判決之成規處理，犯規之學生有如罪犯，此實大有背於養成知恥之意旨，尤達隱惡揚善之大訓，亡國舊習，固不足責。近年以來，改爲佈吿，雖稍與判刑之形式有別，而不足以養成知恥之習慣，則初無大殊。靑年學生，血氣未定，偶有過失，致犯校規，雖不得不加以懲戒，亦冀其改過遷善，何必指其過失於衆目昭彰之地，使其遍受指摘，無地自容，甚至絕其自新之路。如此訓導，何異南轅北轍。况外國大學，亦從無公開處分之事，何必蹈前淸之舊習，棄先進之典型，且忘我國之古訓乎？」</p>
<h3>本學期視導工作　李局長有所指示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局李代局長於昨日下午三時半，在局召集全體督學談話，對本學期視導工作方面作如下指示：（一）本學期私校申請，照規定收費標準增收二成者頗多，各督學應嚴查各校之收費用途，是否用於修建敎育設施方面。關於淸寒學生，如全市各校能眞正做到百分之二十五免費額，則全市不致再有許多失學之學齡兒童。爲防校長取巧起見，各督學應嚴查各校免收之費是否佔總數四分之一，而不僅查其人數是否佔四分之一。（二）體育，勞美，音樂，童軍，理化等專科視察，應用其所長，使减輕查案工作，專做視導工作，則收效較宏。（三）各校學生家長會之組織，雖有甚多困難，仍應就有能力之家長，力促其組織完成。（四）綠化敎育，敎局已有樹苗分配，各督學應特別督促各校於植樹節植樹。李代局長並特別指出督學之主要職責，非僅注意敎育經費之支用力求其當，及視導學校設施力求其妥善兩點，督學實爲敎師之友及顧問，應共以研究方式，力謀敎育之進步。尤其鄉區督學，可在鄉留住一二天，以明瞭學校環境，俾知如何改進而指導之。</p>
<h3>家庭化的滬大　校長領導職業座談　學生舉辦勤工自助</h3>

<p>爲了使師生間的感情更融洽起見，除了模仿英國各著名大學所採用的導師制，保持師生間的述繫外，本學期的師生聯歡遊藝會已於三月五日在大禮堂舉行，在蔣主席所書校訓「信義勤愛」的橫額下，展開了一個最「友愛」的塲面。而每星期五的晚上，也由學校規定爲「交際夜」，各團契學會可儘量舉行遊藝會，以資聯絡感情。同時，學校已着手組織兩個旅行團，準備在春假中集體遊春。</p>
<p>當然，學校中也　別體念到消寒同學的痛苦，本學期除了接受市政府統一奬金及南北浸禮敎會的助學金外，學校本身也在學費收人總額中撥出十分之一，作爲補助，並且繼續舉辦淸寒學生的勤工自助，由學校按各生的擅長，分配至各部門協助工作，每月給以若干報酬。</p>
<p>經常特殊兩種消遺</p>

<p>環校幽徑　六千餘呎</p>
<p>在心理建設方面，滬江的確已獲十分的成就，然而在物質方面仍力加擴充，務使達到眞善美的境界，像新築水泥綱球塲則將竣工，新女生宿舍之經費已由國外敎會捐贈，最近磚石已水運　校，旬日內動工；並且爲紀念劉故校長起見，預備擴充圖書館，定名爲湛恩國，建　　　認計已由畢業校友担任；　前間　　　的一情人路一（Iove　lane），已改　成　　　徑，　長六千餘　，尤以清浦江邊一帶，　　　　　　。</p>

<h3>恩卡斯報復前仇　大公隊苦戰受挫　綠林得甲二A組冠軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲組，西靑勁旅恩卡斯昨晚擊敗大公，五十六比四十五，報復第一循環戰敗之仇，上半時廿三比廿九，大公落後六分。甲二A綠林五十七比三十二榮膺冠軍。</p>
<p>隔夜聯大勝美海軍麥令斯，使大公主力，不免困乏，故昨戰不能一鼓作氣，而籃底進取，亦遠不如恩卡斯，個人技術，固稱不弱，無奈合作上未見得體，人自爲戰，反顧恩卡斯步步進逼，攻守猛烈，遂使大公不得不吿屈服。</p>
<p>大公恩卡斯之戰，七時半繼第一塲後開始，中圈跳球，蔡文華彈力極佳，格朋乞谷夫自愧不如，鮑萊先進，經屠文龍之努力，成各五平手，忠强追出，繼成七平，文章替柏齡，與文華兩人聯絡進攻，十一比九。十三平手後，局勢開始轉變，恩卡斯迭增至二十，攻勢可畏，大公屢易陣容，未甚見效，球運亦差，幸賴華龍兩人之遠射點綴，上半時廿三比廿九，大公落後六分。下半時文龍文華仍撑持局面，一不小心，復被對方高視闊步而前，卅三比四三相差十分之多，從此勝負判分，大局吿定，大公雖作困獸之鬥，卒難遏阻在襲，終以四十五比五十六不敵恩卡斯。</p>
<p>首塲錄林與體聲，樂嘉洲爲錄林獲得二分，林少華罰中，三比〇前導，體聲湯銘新隻手破籃，正擬有所發展，奈綠林正森存忠嘉洲及云山擲罰連連，體聲無法招架，前半綠林以三〇比十六佔先。再戰聲中，雙方陣容，互有更迭，惟戰局仍爲綠林所操縱，時間完畢綠林以五七比卅二輕取體聲，榮膺該組冠軍。</p>
<p>今晚二幕</p>
<p>籃球聯賽甲一組，今晚兩幕，仍在市體育館舉行，入塲券樓上三萬，樓下六萬，秩序錄後：</p>

<h3>南北米市漲風擴大　粳秈均創新高價　週末銷較多產區價格又劇漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨米市劇升，去路暢旺，特高粳創三四〇萬元新高價。各貨均較上日高漲二十五萬至三十萬元。據悉上漲原因爲：（一）產地報漲二十餘萬元。（二）店方納胃頗濃。（三）銀根奇鬆。來貨不暢。</p>
<p>昨南市登記到貨三七七九石，北市五一九三石。市價特高粳南市三三〇萬，北市三四〇萬。白粳南市三二七萬，北市三三二萬，薄稻南市三二五萬，北市三三〇萬。早稻南市三一〇萬，北市三二〇萬。羊秈南市三一七萬，北市三三三萬。白元南市三二五萬，北市三三四萬。險元南市三一〇萬，北市三〇五萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉　蘇錫價格均高，執主心思堅信，散戶實銷均納胃頗濃，價在緊俏之心理下，甫開即跳。兵船粉開市一百四十二萬，中途略回爲一百四十一萬五千，瞬即轉升至一百四十二萬元，高於上日八萬元。老車粉交易不如兵船之活絡，價爲一百四十四萬，後送到亦一百四十四萬，紅蜂建成先開一百四十萬，收市　百三十萬五千元。麩皮上漲甚力，大包升六七萬元，小麥價在二百萬，未開。</p>
<p>雜糧　一致高翔，收市稍回平。黃豆扳提殊力，早挺十餘萬，但銷路平常，終稍回小，軋漲十萬。苞米亦然，早升十萬，但靑島價格不高，客帮雖納而不多，是　後市回退，略高於上日三萬元。揀靑本街去化靈活，升五萬。荼豆升十多萬，紅糧亦砌高十萬元。芝蔴津帮不納，市呈呆定。生仁高貨銷本街，稍挺十萬，中次平平。</p>
<p>食油　初開時人心至為堅昂，豆油回龍交易殊多，早開最爲堅俏。由於貨主竭力扳抬，故開高盤。大有豆油六百五十五萬開盤，一度喊六百六十萬，終以開價過高，本街裏足，散戶反有乘高出售者，後市遂回軟。豆油低至六百五十萬及六百四十五萬，仍高於上日二十餘萬元。靑島吉桶生油由七百四十五萬而至七百五十萬，較上日漲三十萬元。生菜蔴油各昂二十餘萬，小車蔴油跟升三十萬外，豆餅在堅俏之心理下，升二三萬元。</p>
<h3>宋漢章等推進　國貨外銷運動</h3>
<p>宋漢章翁文灝錢新之張肖梅等，昨中午爲促進國貨外銷，在國際飯店十四樓柬邀各界談話，到沈熙瑞趙棣華壽毅成王志莘盧作孚胡西園王性堯等卅餘人。席間首由宋漢章氏致詞，略謂國貨運動，倡之有年，過去努力之方向，偏車國內，對於外銷雖亦有相當成就，尙未完成理想。時至今日，國貨外銷已成當前迫切之需要，朝野上下咸覺唯有努力推進外銷國貨，工業方有出路與前進。經在座同人協議結果，一致決議籌設中國國貨外銷迷動委員會，推宋漢章翁文錢新之張肖梅爲主席團。蔡承新王性堯潘仰堯爲籌備會召集人。並決定委員會工作大綱如次，（一）協助各業積極推廣，（二）推動輿輪一致以吹，（三）建議政府切實獎，（四）勸導工廠注意技術上改進。</p>
<h3>大批煤米　由美來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大美公司中國熊號，及總統公司格蘭脫號，塔虎脫號，均有大批美米美粉到滬，業誌前報，茲悉又有大批在途來滬中。總統公司阿美勒古斯號，自美紐西蘭運來食米六萬一千七百餘包，明日可到埠。又怡和外洋部經理之美輪中國運輸號，自舊金山裝米六萬六千餘包，約本月十四日抵埠。又大勝利號（譯名）亦自舊金山裝米三萬餘包，約本月十六日到滬。又捷成公司經理之愛特威特斯奎皮號，自西雅圖運來煤斤九千噸，預計今日可到，停靠三井下棧起卸。又丹輪但斯巴勒號，亦自西雅圖裝煤八千五百噸來滬，明日可到，預定停靠三井上棧起卸。上項煤斤，均係燃管會採購。</p>
<p>又招商局海川輪，昨自蕪湖運食米一千餘噸，其中七千餘包係中糧局採購，餘係商貨，現泊楊家波碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>統債外股續俏</h3>
<p>公債昨再現俏態，統丙晨開一〇萬二，高峯達一二萬，而後起回風。大成興五五五室五五二室五〇三室均進，五〇〇室三六〇室五五〇室均出，成交約六百萬。較前收計甲乙升五千元，丙漲一萬一，丁升四千元，戊種亦漲六于元。</p>
<p>外股昨賡續趨漲，鋼業怡啤等上漲更多，洋行帮均進，證劵帮則出。怡紗自晨開一四八萬後，高後步回，退至一四〇萬關邊結束，較之前收計鋼業昂二成，怡睥升一成，航業電話漲半成，餘均徵升。</p>
<h3>國內携運銀幣　並無特殊限制　但不得販賣牟利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於在國內携運銀幣，是否違法一事，頃據本市金融管理局息：携運銀幣，並無數量區域曁請領護照之限制。但如有高價買賣轉販牟利等行爲，則一經查獲，即依法懲處云。</p>
<h3>杜絕資金逃港　繼續嚴密偵查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃自金融有關當局獲悉：政府對資金逃港問題，現正密切注意。除由海關加强緝私外，並繼續偵查經營黑市港匯之秘密機構，以期澈底撲滅，使資金去港之路綫，予以堵塞。</p>
<h3>上海區鋁之限額　第四季分配情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據轍管會息：鋁之限額，除劃出一部份輸入少量鋁管等國內不能自製之原料外，大部份用以輸入鋁錠，以製造鋁片及鋁箔。是以鋁錠配額，乃分成製片製箔兩部份鋁，鋁片爲鋁器業之主要原料，前因該業尙無公會組織，直接給予配額，事實上有不能週密之虞，故一二三三季軋製鋁片之鋁錠配額，暫時全部配予軋片廠（軋片廠共七家，計華商六家，外商華鋁鋼精廠一家）。第四季上海市鋁器業公會組織成立，請求直接配給製造原料，輸管會就配額內提出八五，八〇〇美元，配給該業各工廠。惟仍規定由軋片廠代爲甲請輸入，並製軋成片，供作原料之用，以杜流弊。此項辦法，不僅符今進出口貿易第十條所定，輸管會得參酌情形，將限額逕行配予各該業廠商之原則，且兼顧軋片廠之權益。至於製箔之鋁錠配額，輸管會輸入限額分配處，曾經通盤研　後，交華鋁鋼精廠申請，並製造供應。按華鋁廠每月售與華商烟廠之鋁箔，平均爲一，五〇〇箱，足敷該業需要之七成。外商頤中烟廠按其產量七成計算，每月應得鋁箔三四〇籍，兩共需鋁錠八十一噸。再加外埠及少量其他用途，每月約共一百噸左右。現有配額，已不爲少。且自備外匯無證到埠貨物內，鋁箔一項，約値二百餘萬美元。申請收購者，爲數已不小，其餘亦在陸續申請中。華鋁廠獲行　四季製箔鋁錠配額，亦達七一，五〇〇美元，故目前鋁箔來源充沛，供應可無問題也。</p>
<h3>華股週末虛怯　多頭爭先了結</h3>
<p>華股昨大半時間在盤局中過去，近午忽感虛脫，臨收多方忽感負担不起，紛起斬售，熱股反以低盤結束，僅榮豐內衣中法趨挺，而華新除權交易，　吿漲停。</p>
<p>晨初平疲，永紗以一一八〇元及二二三〇元開盤，華新水泥重行賣買，以二二〇元開後，大衆爭購，立即宣吿漲停板，尙屬求過於供。永紗自一一三七元及一一二八元起，由一〇四號三五號一四一號進即交，七六號五四號一六號一四號二〇六號七一號二二六號進遞交，升爲一二〇七元及一二五八元。三六號現遞均賣，六一號一二號出遞交，一七八號一二號二二八號了結即交，退至一一七七元及一二二五元。一六號一四號二〇六號一八三號九七號一六三號進遞交，一〇四號二一八號進即交，聞紡建停開紗布之說，人心一振，再漲到一二一五元及一二六三元高價，此際內衣越做越高，榮豐亦見俏利，中法迫近漲限，一六號一七八號六五號一七二號七六號七一號一八三號七四號二〇六號一九〇號二一三號三六號紛售遞交，一三一號一三〇號九五號了結即交，近午忽感普遍斬多，中法急切回落，永紗降至一一六三元及一二〇三元低價。午收爲一一六四元及一二〇四元。結果較前收計即交股華新漲停，榮豐內衣中法各升半成，中絲微升，恒豐中紡中泥均平，永紗美亞信和新光閘北國貨景福景綸新華華豐統益火柴永公微降，大通商務麗安勤興跌半成。遞交股一致跌落少許。塲外各未上市股票以大生及文化股再好半成左右，最見俏利，餘均平庸。</p>
<p>信誼藥廠變更登記聲請證明文件，業已繳驗，自三月八日前市起恢復賣買。</p>
<p>景福衫襪自三月十日起換發股票，遞交自三月十一日起，即交三月十六日起，改以股票交割。</p>
<h3>客幫吸納　棉紗盤挺</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因連日上漲已多，似達登峯造極之境，客商嫌價太貴，納意懈怠，故晨開行情盤旋，後以外埠紗價報俏，南北兩帮吸納轉强，檯面帮亦來收吸，市勢頓吿挺秀。</p>
<p>最後四十一支監鳳細紗，比上日步漲一百元，爲一億三千萬元。其餘　支組細紗，亦都回升五六十萬至一·二百萬元不等。</p>
<p>散多吐售布疋略挫</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開因銀根趨緊，人心虛軟，喊價稍降，旋以頭寸寬裕者，見賣即進，染廠乘低吸納，買風展開，市勢頓呈挺俏。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，南北兩帮以匯水提升，吸胃甚健，行情一度飛揚。迨近收時，散多獲利乘高吐售，結果各檔細布比上日均回　一·二萬至七·八萬元，此外嗶嘰直貢市亦挫落八萬，惟色布及一九〇士林布，廠商因工料迭漲，美亭雛鷄一統等均軋升一二十萬，細斜粗布等平穩之局。</p>
<p>廠方負擔棉紗統稅</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日報載棉紗存廠期間所增加之統稅，並不歸廠方負擔各消息，紗管會以此項消息，與實際情形不符，代電六區公會轉知更正。茲將紗管會致六區公會代電錄後：「第六區棉紡織機器工業同業公會覽，本日報載對於代紡棉紗，未提貨棧單之增加統稅負擔問題，該會提出意見兩項，已由本會採納，准照原提辦法辦理等語。查關於此事，昨據該會王理事長等來會陳述意見，當由本會袁主委答以案經本會第四次委員會議議決，驟難變更，該會如有其他充分理由，可再以書面請求覆議。昨日談話之經過如此，報載一節，殊與事實不符，應由該會設法轉知更正，免滋誤會」云。</p>
<h3>海關沒收到埠貨物　概以起運日期為限</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三月五日報載，本市進出口商業同業公會，對於海關處理三十六年十月一日以後無證起運貨物辦法，表示反對一節，頃接江海關來函解釋如下；「（一）進出口商業同業公會所稱，本關對於十月一日以前起運貨物，而到埠在十月一日以後者，將予沒收一節，查與事實不符。本關第一八七號布吿明白規定，以起運日期爲限而與到埠日期無關。</p>
<p>（二）到埠貨物究係何日起運，非商人將　關提單發票等，連同報單呈　後，本關無從知悉。故凡十月一日以前起運，而於十月一日以後到埠之貨物，如自本關第一八七號布吿之日起，十五日內仍未將　單發票等讀件呈　　織者，因本關無從知其起運日期，不免間有按照新辦法簽發處分通知書之事。</p>
<p>（三）商人接到上項通知書後，如其貨物確係三十六年十月一日以前起運者，自可照通知書上之規定，於十五日內連同證件，以書面聲明異　，本關自當予以考慮，並無不問起運日期，凡十月一日以後無　到埠之貨物，一律予以沒收處分之事。」</p>
<h3>去年箱茶貨欵　月半可以償清</h3>
<p>農民銀行去年度承押箱茶，到期未償還者，四聯總處特准公開標售。農行業於本年一月廿一日實行首次標售，當眸標出數量不多僅平綠祁紅千餘箱。該行原擬繼續舉行第二次標售，嗣爲顧及茶商困難，在二次未定期標售前，仍可備款贖回。該行以此項押款，拖延甚久，亟應結束，特通知各茶商於本月十五日前，全部贖回，完淸手續，逾期即舉行第二次標售。近來茶價轉好，各茶商已紛紛前往該行了淸手續，截至目前爲止，尙未贖回之箱茶，不及四千箱，未還貸款，僅三十億左右。本月十五日前，茶商可全部償淸，去年茶貸，月內當可結束。</p>
<h3>出口業提供意見　期改善工業貨欵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕當局現正考慮儘速開放工商貸款，本市出口商業鑒於過去政府辦理出口貸款之辦法，未能盡善盡美，該業特彙集業中意見，提供當局參考：（一）對象：應遍及一般商品，若使限於桐油，生絲，茶葉，猪鬃，蛋品等少數商品，則欠公允，而失促進輸出之意義。（二）額度：以前每筆限五億元，如超過此限額，需專案呈准，現物價高漲，需款自鉅，茲提議貸款額由出口商自行申報，根據其輸出貨物，在指定期內（假定三個月爲一期），可以換得之外匯數字　貸之國家行局可調查審定之。（三）期限：貸款期限應視出口貨品之不同而久暫，以收購，整理，包裝，提煉或運輸實際所需時間爲標準。總期限應延長至六個月，打包放款延長至三個月。（四）押品：出口物資，在購入以後，出口以前，尚需加工整理，勢難押存倉庫，建議採取銀行信用保證辦法，如保證銀行必欲用實物抵押者，得以商品有價證劵或其他不動產抵充。（五）利率：應維特原辦法，以不超過月息三分爲度，但出口商如有利用低利貸款，不用以出口情事，或輸出所得外匯數，較申報外匯數額較少時，國家行局得取消下次申請貸款之資格或處以罰款。（六）其他：在無國家行局分支機構之次要通商口岸，應准許出口商選擇有利地點，辦理出口貸款手續。出口商因收購物資而需匯款時，應予以匯款之便利。</p>
<h3>絲綢盤旋上揚</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市盤旋上揚，卒較上旦漲起八百萬元。一二〇號旭字有光，上午最大行情爲六千二百萬元，最小爲五千七百萬元，下午最大價到六千七百五十萬元，最後爲五百萬元賣出價。　廠經昨市再吿微升，惟週六交易甚寂，各級喊價俱比上日大起五百萬一元之譜。五担頭均無做開，零担亦祗二三担成交，高零担價做九千五百萬元，中級零担在三百萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市續高，華强眞絲被面開市在三百四十萬元左右，盤旋甚久，收市升至三百八十萬元，週一期大一百二十萬元。大誠格子璧縐，收市價爲三十一萬一千元，比上日大六千元。林記蠟羽紗十四萬元，民生競芳呢四十萬元，本街及客帮均有納胃。</p>
<p>茶市囘振</p>
<p>茶市趨勢，依然鋒利，惟晨開因聞天津帮對於卅六年度紹炒，每担僅出四百萬元左右，尙有胃口，故人心較餒，過程一度曾現虛悸。所幸市上存底業已將罄，市氣遂急遽回振。其他各茶，均得買戶埀愛，行情堅金盤旋。</p>
<p>木材堅房</p>
<p>昨日木材市面，以謠傳自由外匯有開放之說，市勢續趨堅秀·各行門莊零星去化不弱，建築帮辦意蠕動，惜乎存到不充，市盤更覺鋒俏。洋松方子每尺昂至五萬三千元，普通片子五萬二千元，五分松板鋸方每丈亦漲至九十萬元，36尺柳安三夾板，每張卅三萬。3尺售卅八萬元。至杉木價亦跟高，大條每尺售一萬一千五百元，小條一萬一千元，較前又扯升一成左右。</p>
<h3>橡膠套鞋上漲</h3>
<p>橡膠套鞋市面，因生活指數增高，廠商人工開支亦大，廠盤迭次調整，同業批發市亦激昂，更以本外埠雨季銷路發動，蒞滬採辦者胃口甚健，做開雙錢牌圓口男套鞋每打昂至一百八十七萬，天足女鞋一百四十五萬，大平靴二百七十五萬，回力長統靴九百六十萬，特製球鞋四百二十五萬元，其餘箭鼓大喜大中華等貨，亦均較前軋升二一成不等。</p>

<h3>茶館文學</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>在上海已經多年了，茶室與咖啡館之類　塲所偶然也去坐過，但總覺須其中風趣遠不如內地鄕下回小茶館。也許因爲自己已經是落伍了，所以對於摩登與前進的東西，已不能「迎頭趕上」。不過鄉下老虎灶式　的茶館，較之都市間新型，的茶　和咖啡館來，確乎富有人情味。</p>
<p>在鄕下的茶館中，老闆和茶客之間的關係就不僅是賣買關係，老闆有時就是茶客，他會坐下來和你談生意，談苦經，聊閒天，你在那裏決不會因坐得太久而遭受「　倌」的白眼，有時堂倌也會和你答上一句半句的，使你感到這裏充滿了樸質的人情和友誼。</p>
<p>假使你是熟客，喝了茶更不須馬上付現錢，你上午泡的茶到下午還可以去喝。而在茶客與茶客之間，更處處是熟面孔。你雖不必個個去招呼，但要是你高興招呼誰，你準能找到和你談話的對手。鄉下的茶館，實化是一個不可缺少的社交塲所。</p>
<p>「　茶館」的生活，也許不免有幾分浪費生命，不過眞正的鄉下茶館，大多數的茶客都是忙中偷閒的赤脚人，除了鎭上的幾位縉紳先生或商店老闆之流外，成日孵茶館的人畢竟不多。在農忙的時候，就很少見到一二閒客。這和都市中茶室和咖啡館中終日配攘往來的情形，究竟差得遠了。</p>
<p>偶見有人批評現在的文化界祗有色情文學和「茶館文學」。色情文學我是知道的，至於茶館文學究何所指，最初頗有些汒然。繼而一想，大槪是指的一輩專寫閒情逸致和身邊瑣事的文章·因爲這類束西，在思想前進的人看來，就有類於鄕下的茶館，是完全浪費的·所以議之謂茶館文學。</p>
<p>如果我猜的不錯，我倒想爲茶館文學說幾句話了。</p>
<p>我覺得茶館文學這稱呼並不壞，至少不比新風花雪月派的都市「茶室文學」或「咖啡文學」壞。因爲茶館文學雖都不大講究「嚴肅精神」，但究竟不失是人間感情的流露。這恰如鄕下茶館中赤脚人的談天說地，雖不免失之粗俗，然終不失是感情的眞墊表現一樣。而據我所知，眞摯的感情，才是一切文學與藝術的基本條件之一。</p>
<p>譬如現在有一輩詩人們都喊說應向某詩人「看齊」。爲甚麽要向這位詩人「看齊」呢？就無非是因爲這位詩人所唱的「山歌」，能多多取材於民間的歌謠而已。換句話說，就是因爲這種詩多少有些人間味。那怕不識字的鄉下人，也能聽懂幾句。實在說，這類詩也應該屬於茶館文學的。</p>
<p>如果說茶館文學僅指扯淡淸談之類的東西，我覺得也沒有甚麼壞處。因爲這類文章也許對世道人心沒有甚麽大貢獻，但畢竟也無害於人心的。語言與文字，都不過是人川來表達自己觀感的工具。有些人喜歡文以載道，詩以言志，寫出許多有意義的作品來，這自然是値得贊佩的。但因爲我喜歡這類文章，就編派別人的祗是茶館文學，那就不免量太窄了。</p>
<p>民意民意的呼聲大　已聽得多了，但要是說中國鄕村中有甚麽眞正的民意機關，恐怕應該該推邊僻山鄉之間的小茶館了。小茶館中的村夫野談，雖然未可盡信，但究竟都是人與人之間的話，粗野是粗野的，可是有的是眞感情，而且有時且不失眞知灼見。</p>
<p>茶館文學也是如此，寫這類東西的人，雖然沒有一現成的理　做範本，但祗要他寫　是他想說的話，就無人可以反對他。過去有人提倡雜文，豈非就是這個意思嗎？要是雜文也祗能是一家　大下，那還有甚麽「雜」可誓呢？</p>
<h3>論關係</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>當今之日（其實古時亦然），凡事脫不了各式各樣的關係。學者治文，不是稱政治關係，經濟關係，就是說社會關係，歷史關係。不少注重實利的人則更留意人事關係，同鄕關係……等而下之，則如裙帶關係等，視爲進身之階。美國的若干專家更撰有「顧客關係」，「國際貿易關係」等書，煌煌巨著，靡不發人深思。</p>
<p>次就處世的見聞言之，我們偶或上一家公司去訪友，發現主持其事者係一翩翩少年，而老年持重者反供其驅策，後來再一打聽，原來此君是鉅商某公的公郞，我們便啞然無言了。</p>
<p>試再以本報所載的赫爾回憶錄爲例，前幾天正寫到珍珠港戰事爆發前後的緊張關頭，以赫爾經驗之豐，閱歷之深，獨不得參予羅斯福總統的軍事會議，反之，小羅斯福官職遠在赫爾之下，却能隨侍在側，凡是赫爾回憶錄中所無法葉集與無從目睹的史科，小羅斯福能從容得之，此無他，蓋羅斯福總統係其尊人耳。</p>
<p>當觀世人善於利用關係者，左右逢源，小也者如買東西可打折扣，領取配給品或繳　費等，可無須排隊……大也者，如發財，如陞官，均在其中。按歐美各國以工作效率高强，知稱於世，他們所標榜的「以最低的努力，取得最大的收穫」，在我國祗可爲「善於利用關係」者道云。</p>
<p>好萊塢劇作家某公，曾在他的筆下，創造過薩繆爾這一個角色，足爲這一類人物的典型，薩繆爾出身淸寒，利用他的狡黠與機智，充分利用　種機會與關係，由報僮而爲報館練習生，再升爲「無綫電專欄」編輯，從此一帆風順，竊用他人劇本，而得躋身好萊塢導演之材。他一手揮着粗大的雪茄烟，社會上許多嚴局的門，都被他打開了，後來他負緣得與某擁資不貲的製片商之女締婚，嫁奩有豪華寬敞的別墅一所，且可獲得某大電影公司的管理權，薩繆爾正覺趾高氣揚，不可一世，却在他的婚夕，發現他的妻子與某電影演員私通，在他的慾望滿足以後，緊接而來的竟是失望。從側重關係論的觀點看來，這似乎是一個令人掃興的結尾。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十二章　萍水姻緣（九〇）</p>
<p>綺紈到醫院經過洗腸和服　　後　所吞金戒指，不到幾個鐘頭使瀉出來，因受了極深的激刺，精神很是萎頓，便在醫院住下。這種意外的風波，肖鶴認爲與家門名譽有關，吩咐一切下人，有人來訪問老板，只說因病到醫院，至到什麽醫院，不用吿訴他們。肖鶴雖然要嚴守秘密，無如一般底下人嘴快，三三兩兩　傳出去，一般小報，認爲是新鮮題材，大加渲染，不兩天工夫，弄得滿城風雨，無人不知。渚齋看了報紙上紀載，急忙趕到綺紈家裏，查問小王媽，小王媽認爲渚齋不比別人，把商後　形，全吿訴了渚齋，渚齋聽說繆處長，拔槍威脅，很是動氣，又覺得綺紈這種遭遇，大是可憐，急趕到西什庫醫院探問，醫院裏因得綺紈的要求，無論什麼客人來找，都不接見，所以渚齋連去了幾次，都不能和綺紈見面，急得渚齋祗有寫信詢問，也沒答覆。原來綺紈自受了這次刺激，覺得面子上太不好看，尤其是渚齋萬不能再見他，目前造成這局面，渚齋不知就裏，心裏終不免妬忌怨恨，若是再見面，一知緣由，更不好應付，所以每日除小王媽和肖舊來看視她，談了幾句話，其餘時間，便一人守在病室，靜看小說消遣。有時走出房外，在走廊上，呼吸空氣，心中雖見鬱悶，終不願離開醫院，因爲一出去，見着一般親友，顏面太不好看。綺紈爲的避羞，在醫院一住便已一禮拜，這天薄暮，由屋內出來，在走廊上，倚着欄干，呆望院內花圃，見兩隻晚鴉，在一株古槐上，啞啞的呌，呌了幾聲，便雙雙往南飛去，在這暮色迷茫中，這幾聲寒鴉，送到耳裏，凄淸動人。綺紈呆望天末，那一雙寒鴉，已飛得無影無踪，心裏很是惆悵，覺得鳥倦知還，像這一雙飛鴉，日暮天寒，還有歸宿所在，自己由十幾歲，即在藝術圈奮鬥，也不知經了多少風波，多少變故，到今日仍是沒有一個歸宿途徑。從前所理想的，到了今天，都成幻影，所抱希望，沒一件是能够達到的。</p>
<h3>凌霄漢閣最近之收藏</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>關於凌霄漢閣，大都曉得他精於古今中外的文字，而不知他對於收藏金石古物，尤有特殊的鑒別。記得他今年在北平市冷攤上，遇者一個舊家子弟，持有古硯一方求售，細細審視，確爲淸代四大書家中之翁覃溪老人故物。覃溪書法，方正精嚴，能以隸法包入楷書之內，有淸一代，唯此老可以直接晋唐。硯長約四寸，厚一寸，闊三寸，爲蜀宮綠皮瓦所製，色采蒼深雅豔，極古色古香之妙。牠的邊緣，鐫有覃溪老人硯銘，銘曰：菭華歛翠，墨痕凝碧，蜀宮片瓦，壽千萬　。計共十六宇。末署覃溪老人四字。觀其筆畫古茂，氣韻凝鍊，的是老人生平傑作。凌霄漢閣收藏後，以拓片寄余海上，余爲題一詩於上云：「覃溪老人歐體書，方圓峭勁光璠璵，蜀宮瓦硯雲氣噓，揮毫灑落行自如；菭　墨痕古之餘，深鎪淺鏤體態舒，銘字十六其寳諸，一代瓌翰由爬梳。老人已杳凄邱墟，遺物流轉無藏儲，誰歟得者凌霄徐，寸田尺宅供菑畬。文字磅礴騰廣譽，一紙背拓遙寄余。蒼深雅豔輝蝸廬，使我心情直入唐之初，置諸座右如珮琚，千齡萬禮神相於。</p>
<p>他又於廠甸中收得朔平　印一顆，朔平在山西省北部，倚長城，爲控制邊疆重鎭，水拓一片寄來。他自題一詩云：「兩世齊疆百里侯，愧無一篆繼前修，銅符入手眞奇遇，得此何殊典一州。」下註：「先人兩世作宰齊州，吾兄第七人，無司民收者，今得此印，差可慰情，可笑亦可喜也。」他的祖老太爺偉侯先生，以名進士出宰山東，父太爺子怡先生，亦以名孝廉出仕山東，故稱兩代作宰齊州。猶記偉侯先生，在那道光丁未年會試時，文已吿成，忽聞隔號有呻吟聲，揚簾探詢，乃合肥李傅相鴻章，文祗一藝，病甚，不能續作。先生索觀，斷爲必中，遂與足成之，繳卷同出，是科均成進士，因此往來，投分益深。然先生不藉其力，仍爲親民之官，罷官後，任金臺書院山長，一家科甲，迎綿不絕，致靖侍郞，及彥甫瑩甫兩太史，皆負當時淸望。余友靜齋次韻和之云：「千首詩輕萬戶侯，百城書擁攬靈修，忽然綰得銅符貴，一室堂皇收九州。」余爲題其拓片云：「五馬黃堂六品官，空名也飽腐儒餐，但看纍纍銅符握，已歎聲聲玉樹殘。鸞鳳豈眞棲枳棘，文章要自起波瀾。知君擁得方州任，不必朮彈貢禹冠。」得印不奇，得府印則奇，以書生而得官印則更奇。世間何事不是兒戲，官印在當時，關係甚大，時移世變，不値一錢，然則作官亦何嘗不如此！古人所說巍巍乎可畏者，豈能永久如此耶？</p>
<p>他於收得朔平府印之外，又收得寗津縣學官印一方，也以拓片相寄。他又自題一詩云：「此是當年豆腐官，殘杯冷炙足寒酸，而今豆腐如金貴，且對銅章覔古歡。」下註：「學官昔稱吃豆腐官，今則豆腐每方國幣萬元矣。」以上海而論，大塊豆腐，已在兩萬元以上，物價之漲，正漫無止境也。余友靜齋又次原韻和之云：「銅章權作老儒官，况味如嘗苜蓿酸，堪羨書生生計足，宮牆容得一家歡。」書生無路謀生，果然得如淸代學老師之俸，有學宮可以借住家眷，學田可以收穫，何樂而不爲乎。余又爲題一章云：「一紙官如鄭廣文，逍遙冀北已空羣，頭銜苜蓿能兼味，心事蓬蒿待策勳；入握銅鈴誇寳貴，就揮硃墨動風雲，如今丁戊無行祭，咀嚼何時饜大葷。」學老師，惟値丁戊祭祀大典，可以大嚼胙肉。</p>
<p>他又於兩紙尾註云：「戊子游廠甸，旣得一府印，又得一儒學銅章，蓋皆奸僞家中藏品，沒產後，其家屬因貧出售，鼓販展轉入市而歸於我。向來平市出售舊印，多各旗佐領之類，若地方關防，大抵禁止出售，故此兩印，均係私藏轉出，可云得未曾有。儒學昔稱「吃豆腐官兒』，以其淸寒特甚，除秀才贄敬及學田租外，別無收入，吃不起葷肴，惟丁祭日分胙肉，倍於邑宰，可資大嚼。曾有人以聯謔之云：『掃雪呼童，莫認今朝點卯；轟雷請客，共知昨日祭丁。」形容盡致，然係紀實，故不爲虐。吾宜周銀台家楣之尊人愛棠先生，曾官海州學官，又任河督道鎔，由道光己酉拔貢，得學官，仕至東河總督，皆曾嘗苜蓿風味。」學官雖屬寒酸，然向來「顧視淸高氣深穩」的人，正是求之不得。宦海多風波，而學官則無之，苦在是，樂亦在是也。</p>
<h3>風雨無阻</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>美國名將奧杜奈爾在密希根州任聯隊長時，辦公大樓前有一方很好的草地，他就派了一個屢經戰役的老軍曹負責每天灌溉。軍曹一接到命令，又立刻派了一個士兵，呌他每天下午三點鐘澆水一次。</p>
<p>一天，大雷雨，那位老軍曹巡閱營房，看見那個負責澆水的士兵正在睡覺。</p>
<p>軍曹大怒，說道：「現在正是三點鐘，你爲甚麼不去澆水！」</p>
<p>士兵請朮着說：「可是，長官，雨下得那麼大呀！」</p>
<p>軍曹怒氣不减，呌道：「下雨有什麽關係！你不是有雨衣嗎？」晋霖</p>

<p>自由不會降賜給我們，必須我們努力去爭取；自由是一種享受，但必須用相當的代才可以得來。—孟德斯鳩</p>
<h3>漫談孟子</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>有一時期—好像是在北伐前後—文化界之領導人物對於學生閱讀古書很表反對，也有小數表示贊成的，然聲勢不大，於當時風氣也不合，終於除僅爲好古者作爲珍藏之對像外，古書已變得很不時髦，退居於文化之爲人們所不注意不重視之一角。孟子一書亦是其一</p>
<p>昔之士人列四書爲必讀書，自初即「子曰」「詩云」；我猜這幾部書對於中國的文化界是不無重大影響的。或謂孔流所倡的仁義之道在中國似乎也米曾實行過，十人讀了賽過未曾讀一般。只是須知往昔的人若是不讀孔孟書，事情也許　要糟些，亦未可知。</p>
<p>據我個人的見解，古書未嘗不可一讀，只不要讀得太早。以孟子一書來說，我初時在「老法先生」督促之下，曾通讀一過，可說讀得滾瓜爛熟而至於「背一得出的地步。至於理解方面，也不能說絕不瞭解，只是心頭總覺此書所說的話極爲平常，即使不說，我也早已知道，於是認爲迂腐得很。所以那時我讀孟子，恰如孟子在對牛彈琴，心中一無所感，不爲所動。倒愛讀離現實較遠的書，如老莊一類。年逾而立後，偶而再　孟子，　如看見了一件新鮮的事物，眼前爲之一亮，頗有古詩「五月榴花照眼明」的感覺，愈謂愈覺得新鮮可喜，美不勝收，有如柳暗花明地一村又一村。</p>
<p>右人說過：講民主，孟子比今人更民主。孟子所講究的與覇道對立的「王道」，　看好像神秘，實則即是「仁政」，「仁政」無他，即是一切以人民利益爲前題的政治。「王道」主義的口號是：「天視自我民視，夫聽自我　聽。」依今人的話來說，這　是行重「民意」。以這個大前　爲出發點，所以他說：「國君進賢，如不得已，將使卑踰尊，疏踰戚，可不愼與？左右皆曰賢，未可也；諸大夫皆曰賢，未可也，國人皆曰賢，然後察之；見賢焉，然後用之。」這便很像今日的「普選制」；國君進賢，不妨卑踰尊，疏踰戚，比即不任用私人。孟子又說：「左右皆曰不可，勿聽；諸大夫皆曰不可，勿聽；國人皆曰不可，然後察之，見不可焉，然後去之。」這便是今之「罷免權」。又說：「左右昔曰可殺，勿聽；諸大夫皆曰可殺，勿聽；國人皆曰可殺，然後察之；見可殺焉，然後殺之，故曰：國人殺之也。」這個辦法比今日司法的「陪審制」似乎還要進一步。</p>
<p>在民主的風氣奉曾盛行時，中國及世界各國對於一國之主的皇帝都寄以神秘性的崇敬，而至於神聖不可侵犯的地步。而孟子却老早就認爲對於禍國殃民的君主是不妨殺掉他的：「齊宣王問　：湯放桀，武王伐紂，有諸？孟子對曰：於傳有之。曰臣弒其君，可乎？曰：賊仁者，謂之賊，賊義者，謂之殘；殘賊之人，謂之一夫，聞誅一夫紂矣，未聞弒君也。「孟子謂齊宣王王曰：王之臣有託其妻子於其友，而之楚遊者，比其反也，則凍餒其妻子，則如之何？王曰：棄之。曰：士師不能治士，則如之何？王曰：已之。曰：四境之內不治，則如之何？王顧左右而言他。「對一國之主人民可以使用罷免權，罷免了他，而他還是不肯滾蛋，人民便可殺掉他，這是孟子的理想。</p>
<p>在孟子的心目中，君主祗是分工合作中的一員，通工易事中的一環。勞力者把勞力的收穫之一部份供給勞心的君主，君主勞心煩神，替人民謀幸福，除禍害，使勞力者安心從事他們的工作。這也可以說：「交易而退，各得其所。」帝王君主初無神聖偉大處。所以孟子在君王之前頗知尊重自己：「孟子將朝王，王使人來曰；寡人如就見者也，有寒疾，不可以風，朝將視朝，不識可　使寡人得見乎？對曰：不幸而有疾，不能造朝。明日出弔於東郭氏。公孫丑曰：二昔者（　以病，今日弔，或者不可平？曰：昔者疾，今日愈，如之何不弔。王使人間疾。醫來。孟仲子對曰：昔者有王命，有采薪之憂，不能造朝。今病小愈，趨造於朝，我不識能至否乎？使數人要於路，曰：請必無歸，而造於朝。不得已，而之景丑氏宿焉。景子曰：內則父子，外則君臣，人之大倫也。父子主恩，君臣主敬；丑見王之敬子也，未見所以敬王也。曰：惡，是何言也。齊人無以仁義與王言者，豈以仁義爲不美也。其心曰：是何足與言仁義也云爾。則不敬莫大乎是。我非堯舜之道，不敢以陳於王前，故齊人莫如我敬王也。景子曰；否，非此之謂也。禮曰：父召無諾，君命召，不俟駕。固將朝也，聞王命而遂果，宜與夫禮若不相似然。曰：豈謂是與？曾子曰：晋楚之富，不可及也，彼以其富，我以吾仁。彼以其爵，我以吾義，吾何慊乎哉？夫豈不義，而曾子言之，是或一道也。天下有達尊三，爵一，齒一，德一，朝廷莫如爵，鄕黨莫如齒，輔世畏民莫如德。惡得其一，以慢其二哉？故將大有爲之君，必有所不召之臣。欲有謀焉，則就之。其尊德樂道，不如是，不足與有爲也。故湯之於伊尹，學焉而後臣之，故不勞而王；桓公之於管仲，學焉而後臣之，故不勞而覇。今天下地醜德齊，莫能相尙，無他，好臣其所敎，而不好臣其所受敎。湯之於伊尹，桓公之於管仲，則不敢召，管伸且猶不可召，而况不爲管仲者乎？「這一席話說得何等的有骨氣，然而又何等的不合時宜。孟子生於今日，其將「孵荳芽」乎？</p>

<h3>Liaoning Completes Offensive Deployment; Naval Fleet Cruises Yingkou Waters; Siping Nationalist Troops Conduct Tactical Shift</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 6th] All quarters are now closely watching the development of the Nationalist troops. The bandits in Liaoyang have begun to waver. It seems the Nationalist troops have completed the offensive deployment on this front. If reinforcements land in Yingkou, southern Liaoning will be the meeting point. The battle in the Siping area of northern Liaoning unfolded on the evening of the 3rd from the Siping airfield. By the night of the 5th, the bandits launched fierce reinforcements. To concentrate forces, the defending troops withdrew towards the city streets. The bandits occupied the airfield and also moved towards the city streets. On the night of the 5th, bandits around Siping began to attack, engaging in fierce offensive and defensive battles. In the Liaobei and Siping areas, the bandits mustered forces including the main forces of the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Columns, as well as Han communist Li Hongguang's detachment, and other local armed forces, numbering no less than one hundred thousand.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 6th] There are indeed signs of progress in the military situation on the Beining Railway. Elite Nationalist troops are now advancing in multiple routes towards the predetermined areas. The Beining Railway and Yingkou Port, which are the land and sea transportation lines between western and southern Liaoning, are both targets.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] China News Agency reports: The central government is indeed using the army, navy, and air force to support the Northeast. In addition to opening up the Liaoxi Corridor, it will also counter-attack Yingkou. At the moment, a Nationalist fleet sailing north from a certain port has arrived in Liaodong Bay, with a portion cruising the waters near Yingkou, monitoring the activities of the communist bandits. It will coordinate with the Nationalist troops in the counter-attack, bombarding the communist bandits in Yingkou, and then forcibly landing. The Allied air force bombers have continuously inflicted heavy damage on the communist bandits' transportation lines carrying machinery and materials from Anshan and Yingkou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] After the bandit troops who had raided the western suburban airfield at Siping were repelled, they redeployed the remnants of their forces on the night of the 4th to launch a fierce attack on our forces. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting throughout the night. To concentrate forces, our defending troops have made a strategic shift. In addition, the bandit troops who had gathered in the Siping area also began to move on the night of the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Wei Lihuang inspected Jicha from Shenyang on the 6th and will return to Shenyang on the 32nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] Recently, the situation in Changchun has become increasingly stable, and prices are lower than in other parts of the Northeast. The military situation also holds an absolute advantage. Currently, due to close cooperation between the military and the people, bandits cannot participate in activities within 50 li outside the city, and the Nationalist troops' sweep area has been expanded to more than 70 li.</p>
<h3>Luo Zhuoying Flies to Shenyang to Report; Important Decisions Made with North China Authorities in Beiping; Full Coordination of Military, Political, and Economic Affairs Inside and Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Full coordination of military, political, and economic affairs inside and outside the Pass has been decided in Beiping. Luo Zhuoying left Beiping at 11:00 AM on the 6th to fly to Shenyang to report. According to Luo, he visited Director Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, and Chairman Chu Xichun in the past few days. They all shared the same feeling that the Northeast and North China are as interdependent as lips and teeth and must "grasp the overall situation and devote all efforts" to deal with the communist bandits. The authorities in North China are deeply concerned about the Northeast and are even more determined not to let the flames of war in the Northeast spread inside the Pass. As for the establishment of a unified command structure in North China and the Northeast, the central government may be considering it. In fact, the battlefields in North China and the Northeast are already inseparable. During this trip to Beiping, in addition to exchanging military opinions with the authorities in North China, there was extensive discussion on the issues of troop sources, food supplies, and transportation in the Northeast. In response to the communist bandits' "three-seek policy", decisions were made on ensuring adequate food sources, troop rations, securing transportation lines, and guaranteeing spring plowing. When asked by reporters about the comparison of the current military value of Yingkou, the Beining Railway, and Shenyang and Jinzhou, Luo said that Yingkou's transportation value is far less than that of the Beining Railway. Shenyang and Jinzhou originally had equal military value, but Jinzhou's military value has increased compared to before.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zuoxiang and Others Return to Beiping Today</h3>

<h3>Tao Xisheng Writes</h3>
<p>Record of Government Not Abandoning the Northeast</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang, will publish an article in the upcoming issue of the Nanjing Central Daily News Weekly, Volume 3, Issue 8, stating that the government will never abandon the Northeast. The Nationalist troops have the ability to defend the major strongholds of Ji, Chang, Si, and Shen, and to open up transportation between Panyang and Yuguan. Tao, with the title of "The Doctrine of Non-Recognition," describes in his article the importance of the Northeast's position and situation, the government's importance to the Northeast, and its determination to firmly defend the Northeast.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent rumors of peace talks, Tao explicitly pointed out that this is a conspiracy of national defeatists. "Their intention is to prepare the Communist Party to resolve the Northeast issue again through negotiation, inducing the government to recognize the fait accompli it has created by violence in the Northeast." Tao also stated: "If the rumors of peace talks are related to the Northeast issue, we must reiterate the doctrine of non-recognition. Chinese patriots, especially our Northeast compatriots, have been fighting for the doctrine of non-recognition for more than a decade. The struggle of those who do not recognize will not end until the Northeast's territorial sovereignty is restored."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Intensifies Crackdown on Trading in Gold and Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Finance believes that illegal trading in gold and foreign currency disrupts the financial system and should be resolutely cracked down on. In addition to submitting the regulations on penalties for trading in gold and foreign currency for approval, amendment, promulgation, and implementation, it also rewards informants and temporarily cancels the limit on the amount of bonuses given to informants in each case to encourage them; the gold management bureaus in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Tianjin are also cooperating with local police authorities to conduct strict investigations and prohibitions.</p>
<h3>Improvement in Remittance Import Methods; Increase in Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Overseas remittances have been repeatedly urged by the Ministry of Finance to the handling banks and bureaus to make practical improvements, and the remittance procedures should be simplified as much as possible to benefit overseas relatives. Recently, the Bank of China has implemented a method of directly delivering remittances to the recipients in areas near Guangzhou where the families of overseas Chinese are concentrated and writing letters on their behalf, which is convenient for the relatives of overseas Chinese, so the amount of overseas remittances has increased in recent months. The amount of overseas remittances received by the Bank of China in the second half of last year and January of this year, converted into national currency value, is listed below: July: 1,737,681.234 yuan, August: 8,928,804.166 yuan, September: 21,235,537.368 yuan, October: 34,616,974.458 yuan, November: 17,231,228.576 yuan, December: 40,904,218.198 yuan, January of the 37th year: 60,844,156.076 yuan.</p>

<h3>Our Country Recognizes the Siamese Government; Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries Resume Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Our government officially recognized the new Siamese government on the 6th and resumed Sino-Siamese diplomatic relations. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 6th: After the coup in Siam on November 9th of last year, general elections were held on January 29th of this year in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. The Democratic Party in the new National Assembly's lower house has a majority of seats. Nai Khuang, the leader of the Democratic Party, was subsequently ordered on February 20th to form a cabinet and obtained a vote of confidence from the lower house on March 5th. The Chinese government believes that the current Siamese government is a legitimate government unanimously supported by its people, and Nai Khuang has stated in a note that the Siamese government will fully fulfill all its international obligations. It has decided to recognize the new Siamese government from March 6th and restore normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The former Siamese government's ambassador to China, Tularak, told reporters: He has not yet received official notification from the Chinese government recognizing the current Siamese government. "Once the Chinese government recognizes the new Siamese government, I will leave China and go elsewhere, either to Siam or elsewhere." Tularak stated: If his return to Siam is safe, he will return to Siam; otherwise, he will go elsewhere, but it is currently difficult to decide. Note: After the coup in Siam on November 9th of last year, Tularak publicly stated that he would not obey the orders of the new government.</p>
<h3>Must Use Real Names for Deposits and Remittances in Banks and Bureaus; Chairman's Handwritten Instruction to the Ministry of Finance to Draft Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to the control of finance and remittances. He recently instructed the Ministry of Finance in his own handwriting that depositors and remitters in all banks and bureaus must use their real names when handling deposits and remittances and that implementation measures should be drafted immediately. After receiving the instructions, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Coinage Department to be responsible for drafting them. It is reported that there have been measures restricting the use of names in the past, and they will be strictly implemented in the future. In addition, when making deposits and remittances in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, identity cards may be required.</p>
<h3>Contents of the US Economic Aid to China Plan; State Department Announces Amount of Aid Goods; Chennault Leaves Shanghai, Via Tokyo, to Fly to the US</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] The State Department announced today that the purpose of US aid to China is to provide the Chinese people with food, clothing, and light. Once Congress approves the $570 million Aid to China Act, the United States will provide China with $130 million in food and $150 million in cotton, which will include 275,000 tons of wheat and rice. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] General Chennault, at the invitation of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US House of Representatives, left Shanghai on the morning of the 6th with his wife on a Northwest Airlines flight via Tokyo to Washington.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] Chennault arrived here on the 6th, made a brief stopover, and will fly to Washington. He told the United Press reporter: "I, MacArthur, and General Wedemeyer all agree on assisting the Chinese government in resisting the Chinese Communists. I greatly admire the opinions of MacArthur and Wedemeyer and have always advocated assisting China. This position remains unchanged."</p>
<h3>US Democratic Senator Taylor's Absurd Proposal</h3>
<p>Actually Asks MacArthur and Wedemeyer to Resign</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Democratic Senator Taylor wrote to President Truman today stating that MacArthur's and Wedemeyer's proposed foreign policy is greatly different from the government's established policy and is obviously in collusion with Wallace's criticism of the government's policy. They should be asked to resign. MacArthur and Wedemeyer's presentation of their opinions to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, intending to provide military assistance to the Chinese government, is in conflict with the government's policy.</p>
<h3>Commodity Tax and Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax; Two Amendment Regulations; Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committees Review and Approve</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] The Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committees held a joint meeting on the morning of the 6th to review and approve the amended Commodity Tax Regulations and Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Regulations submitted by the Ministry of Finance. The main points of the amendments are: (1) Revision of the evaluation method. The previous method of adjusting once every three months has been changed to evaluating once a month; (2) Adjustment of the items subject to commodity tax: (A) Adjustment of cosmetics tax rates. The cosmetics tax, with 14 categories, was introduced in October of the 35th year. Later, in order to protect domestic production, the temporary exemption from tax for five items, including cold cream, face lotion, talcum powder, cologne, and soap, was granted on November 27th of the same year. Since the government is implementing a quota system for imports and cosmetics are prohibited from being imported, the five types of goods for which taxes were suspended should be restored to taxation. Cold cream, face lotion, talcum powder, cologne, soap, hair cream, and hair oil, which are more commonly consumed, will be taxed at 20% ad valorem, and other items such as face powder, rouge, shaving soap, lipstick, perfume, nail polish, and eyebrow pencil will be taxed at 50% ad valorem. (B) Suspension of the tea tax to encourage tea exports. (C) Simplification of the items subject to taxation for wheat flour and cement. (3) Regulations stipulate that the customs office will assess and collect taxes on imported goods from foreign countries. In order to facilitate taxation, please have the customs office use the wholesale price at the port of entry as the basis for assessment and collect taxes at the corresponding rate, and have it clearly stipulated in the regulations so that there is a basis to rely on. (4) Regulations stipulate that exported goods are exempt from tax. The previous regulations stipulated that taxes should be refunded when exporting goods, but the taxation and then the tax refund placed a heavy interest burden on manufacturers and was not beneficial to the national treasury. Therefore, for important export goods that are directly reported and exported from factories, they will be directly exempted from tax. (5) Increase the standard for fixed fines, increasing the current maximum fine of 5,000 yuan stipulated in the regulations to 1,000 times, in order to be practical. (6) The confiscation of goods in violation of regulations will be executed by court decision.</p>

<h3>Instinct, Reason, and National Life - A Comparison Between China and Ethnic Characteristics</h3>
<p>— Lei Haizong</p>
<p>The instinct and reason mentioned in the title of this article are not strict psychological terms, but rather traditional concepts in common human knowledge. Reason is a set of self-consistent principles, with grounds for holding them and reasonable justifications, but without considering the relationship to reality or whether they can be implemented. Instinct is fundamentally unsystematic, merely a feeling of knowing what to do without knowing why; but it is very powerful, and most human behavior, especially important behaviors that concern self-interest, is almost entirely determined by instinct.</p>
<p>This article is not about individuals, but about nations. Among nations, some have developed reason, while others have developed instinct. Generally speaking, a nation that has developed reason but whose instinct has declined is a weak nation; a nation whose instinct is strong regardless of its reason is a vibrant nation. The nation with the strongest instinct in the world today is England. "Nation above all, ethnicity above all" always has the element of a slogan in other countries to varying degrees, but the British people do not even mention such things, because it is the instinctive feeling of every Englishman, and can be said to be part of every Englishman's personality. England is known for producing many eccentrics, all kinds of eccentrics, but there is only one that is very rare, that is, an eccentric who sacrifices national interests for any theory that can be consistently justified to the end. Any heresy in the world can be believed by someone in England, and can be enthusiastically researched and debated in peacetime. But when it comes to an emergency, all theories can be abandoned, and only the interests of the nation cannot be harmed in the slightest. Foreigners often scold the British as hypocrites, as people who say one thing and mean another, and this is the reason. In fact, this is a wrongful accusation. Today, the only people in the world who can divide their personality into two independent, watertight compartments, one for instinct and one for reason, are the British. Other nations cannot keep the two from intermingling completely. England's dominance in the world for hundreds of years before the Second World War came from this.</p>
<p>If an example is desired, the Second World War is probably the best opportunity. In England, members of Parliament have complete freedom of speech, and their speeches in Parliament are absolutely free from any sanctions or restrictions; voting is also completely free and not subject to absolute party discipline. However, in British history, there are almost no examples of abusing this position without regard for the overall situation. For example, in the late stages of the war, Britain advanced into Greece to promote its traditional Near East policy, and when the Greek civil war broke out at the end of 1944, Britain was forced to intervene. This caused a major storm in Parliament, and many members expressed dissatisfaction with the government, based on a set of theories such as "national self-determination," "democracy," "freedom," and "justice." But when it came to the final vote, these members, in the short term, did not want to make things difficult for the government during the war, and in the long term, they all felt the importance of the country's long-term interests in the depths of their hearts. As a result, some people disregarded their previous statements and voted in favor, while others, in order to avoid formally violating their previous statements, either left the meeting or abstained, allowing those who supported the government's policies to win an absolute majority. This kind of thing happened repeatedly during the Second World War, and it is also a common occurrence in British history over the past few hundred years. Three hundred and fifty years ago, when religious competition in Europe was still strong, Spain, the leading nation of the apparent faith, launched the invincible armada to attack England. A minority of people in the British nation believed in Roman Catholicism, but they were never tempted by the internationalism represented by Spain, and unconditionally fought for the country. Even among the high-ranking admirals of the British Navy, there were those who, even though they were faithful, were still trusted by the general British public, and they themselves never excluded themselves, with no intention of sacrificing the country for theory. Therefore, the British people's instinct prevailing over reason did not begin recently, but was already the case three or four hundred years ago.</p>
<p>We can imagine any country being defeated and destroyed, but we cannot imagine England being destroyed by external forces. We are not saying that it is definitely impossible, but rather that we cannot imagine what kind of scene that would be. In 1940, when the Nazis destroyed France and threatened England, with the possibility of landing across the English Channel at any time, the then Prime Minister Churchill made a famous statement in a speech: "We will resist on the beaches, we will resist in the fields, we will resist in the streets, we will resist in the mountains, we will never surrender!" This was not empty talk, nor was it Churchill's personal opinion. Churchill was most representative of the British nation when he said this, and this was the feeling of the entire British people. We can only imagine England resisting even if resistance is absolutely ineffective and the entire population will still fight to the end with their bare hands. The British are the nation with the strongest survival instinct. If we speak in clichés, we can say that the British are the most patriotic. But the British people's patriotism exceeds what is generally called patriotism, so the typical British person has never talked about patriotism, just as ordinary people rarely mention their breathing, walking, or sleeping. That is a natural part of personality, so why talk about it? And what is there to talk about?</p>
<p>In today's post-war world, the countries of the Old Continent, whether victorious or defeated, are all riddled with holes and full of difficulties. Of all these countries, the one that is most willing to endure hardship and most willing to seek the recovery of the country without any sacrifice is England. The lives of ordinary people in England today are even harder than they were when the war was not over, but the people do not complain, and are willing to endure everything in order to grasp the future of the country. Because of the excessive consumption during the war, if judged by common sense, England should actually become a third- or fourth-rate country like France. England's ability to maintain its position as the only second-rate power besides the United States and the Soviet Union today is purely because its survival instinct makes it willing to work hard and persevere desperately. This is an unprecedented discovery of a kind of survival instinct in human history.</p>
<p>Conversely, the nation with the weakest instinct in the world today, so weak that it is almost extinct, is China. This is not to say that China's reason is developed, our reason is not developed. But what is alarming is that those who have a little reason have even worse instincts, and the position of their instincts in their personality is not even as good as that of ordinary ignorant villagers. Except for England, there are probably people in every country who sacrifice the fundamental interests of the country for theory, some more, some less. The most are probably in China. Many statements that originally had content and true meaning in the West have become purely theoretical after being moved to China, unrelated to past history and unrelated to today's reality, and many people can sacrifice everything for this, not counting sacrificing themselves, and also sacrificing the country. We have been making this mistake since we came into contact with Europe and the United States, and the root cause of the disease has not been eliminated to this day. This kind of behavior is probably difficult for people in other countries to understand, and the most puzzled are probably the British, because the British cannot imagine what kind of mood this is.</p>
<p>Reason is a tool of instinct, not its master. What drives history, governs society, and controls life is instinct, absolutely not reason. If idealists find this regrettable, then there is nothing they can do. The fact is so, and complaining will not help. Reason is not afraid of being developed, only of usurping the place of the master. As long as instinct always occupies the dominant position, the more developed reason is, the better. But once instinct degenerates and weakens, no matter how much reason there is, the life of the nation will be in danger. It is not easy to harmonize reason and instinct. England is the only nation in the world with a very high degree of reason whose instinct is not obscured by reason, and there is never a danger of being misled by theory. Such a nation based on instinct can die a violent death due to too much external force, but will not die by its own hand. All those who are in danger of destruction without external destruction must be nations whose instinct has died first. This is the truth that all patriots who want to understand history, recognize the present, and look forward to the future must never forget.</p>
<h3>Vice Chairman Sun Returns to Shanghai, Discusses Impressions of Taiwan, Taiwanese People's Diligent Spirit is Unmatched in the Mainland</h3>
<p>[City News] Vice Chairman Sun Ke returned to Shanghai from Taiwan at around 3:00 PM on the 6th. He immediately met with reporters to discuss his impressions of his trip to Taiwan, saying: The stability shown in all aspects of Taiwan is beyond expectations. Factories in Taiwan Province are now recovering one after another. Although they cannot meet ideals due to insufficient conditions, the spirit of hard work shown by the management personnel of various industrial institutions indicates that they have exhausted all their abilities to revive Taiwan. The reinstatement of farmers and workers has greatly reduced the severity of the unemployment problem, and the people are now able to maintain their livelihoods. Regarding the future construction of Taiwan Province, there is no doubt that the increase in the production of major agricultural products such as rice and sugar cane should be the priority. To achieve the goal of increased production, the first need is to solve the fertilizer problem. The current coal production in Taiwan is about 1.5 million tons per year, and 40,000 tons are supplied to Shanghai and southern China every month. The Ministry of Economic Affairs purchases it at 1.5 million legal tender per ton and sells it at a price several times higher. This policy is actually exploiting the Taiwanese people and should be corrected as soon as possible. I believe that government agencies in Taiwan should pay a fair price for the goods they purchase in order to maintain the purchasing power of the Taiwanese people. The foreign exchange earned from Taiwan's exports should also be returned to Taiwan Province as much as possible to replenish equipment and increase production. As for the compatriots' understanding and trust of the central government, this is a major progress in Taiwan's politics. The county and city councils have all been established, and all important issues are discussed and decided by them. The past situation of separation between officials and the people has disappeared. In addition, it is worth noting that the Taiwanese people, regardless of gender, are self-reliant and diligent in making a living, and their spirit is unmatched in the mainland. Last year, Taiwan Province's grain collection achievement was 98%, which is a manifestation of their law-abiding spirit and is especially worthy of praise. The enrollment rate of school-age children in Taiwan Province is almost 100%, and textbooks are also provided free of charge. The popularization of compulsory education can also serve as a reference for various provinces in the mainland.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 6th] Sun Ke and his wife took a flight back to Shanghai on the 6th. Chairman Wei and the heads of all departments went to the airport to see them off. He felt that his three weeks in Taiwan were a major event in his life.</p>

<h3>Vice President Wang Broadcasts the Significance of Holding Special Relief Donations, the Rich Should Donate Wealth to Save People and Save Themselves</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Executive Yuan Vice President Wang Yunwu broadcasted to the nation on the Central Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM on the 6th on "Why the Government is Holding Special Relief Donations." Wang first stated three meanings of holding special relief donations: first, to balance social wealth and alleviate the impact of social problems; second, to stimulate the conscience of the wealthy and encourage their virtue of loving others, on the one hand, to relieve suffering compatriots from deep waters and on the other hand, to promote the noble sympathy of mankind; third, the wealthy must ensure the safety of their family and property by first ensuring social stability. Therefore, holding special relief donations, although to relieve refugees, is actually to ensure social security and an effective way to protect the property of the rich. In this regard, he earnestly appealed to the wealthy to support the government's decision, saying: the rich must have a long-term vision and the demeanor of the benevolent, to use a part of their own money to universally benefit all beings and relieve the suffering of all beings. Only in this way can we resolve social inequality, eliminate social hostility, so that the poor can live in peace with each other, each get what they deserve, promote the virtue of the benevolent loving others, and achieve self-help by donating wealth to save people.</p>
<p>He then explained the use of special relief donations, saying: According to Article 2 of the Special Relief Donation Measures passed by the State Council, the funds raised this time are limited to being used for relief undertakings and refugee relief. No one has the right to transfer these donations to other purposes. If anyone insists that the government is holding special relief donations this time to raise military expenses, then it is malicious slander, and everything should not be easily bought into.</p>
<p>Regarding the methods of donation, he also gave an explanation. He concluded: Finally, I appeal again to all the wealthy people in the country to generously donate and donate more money, and I also hope that the people in all places will unite and enthusiastically call on the wealthy people to donate money, and assume the responsibility of urging and encouraging, so as to make this great donation work a quick success.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Fei-peng Defends Himself Against Allegations of Profiteering by His Wife in Grain Purchases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reception for Reporters in Hankou</p>
<p>Publicly Reprimanded the Municipal Government Secretary-General</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Minister Yu Fei-peng convened a meeting of newspaper reporters this afternoon, giving comprehensive answers to questions regarding grain administration. He also repeatedly and publicly defended himself against rumors of his wife profiteering from grain purchases, lasting for two hours. A summary of Mr. Yu's answers is as follows:</p>
<p>Grain Administration Issues</p>
<p>(A) To stabilize grain prices, the method of selling off grain reserves should no longer be used. Instead, pricing should be carefully discussed and adjusted according to supply and demand conditions at any time. (B) The allocation of American grain, according to the Sino-American agreement, is limited to the five major cities. Whether Wuhan can be allocated is still uncertain. It is hoped that the city will strive for self-sufficiency. (C) The amount of grain allocated to the five major cities is uniformly calculated based on 1.1 million people, with each person receiving one dou (approx. 10 liters). American grain will supply two-fourths of this amount, with the Ministry of Food and local governments each supplying one-fourth. This measure is intended not only for relief but also to establish a foundation for distributing grain based on population. (D) The results of the grain collection in the 36th year of the Republic (1947) have averaged 75% of the expected amount. Among them, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu and other provinces, due to local stability, have achieved particularly good results, all exceeding 90%. (E) The sharp rise in grain prices in Wuhan is due not only to natural factors around the Spring Festival but also to some unreasonable human-made factors. In the future, the purchase of military grain and the re-export of grain should be streamlined and managed, without allowing disorder. It is especially hoped that local governments will strengthen controls and initiate spring plowing to address the root cause.</p>
<p>Investigating Rumors</p>
<p>After responding to these questions, Mr. Yu showed no intention of discussing specific issues in detail. Instead, with an investigative and defensive tone, he turned to rumors regarding his wife profiteering from grain purchases. He stated, "This matter concerns my wife. If the family is not well managed, how can the country be governed? If this is true, I am willing to be punished by law." After speaking, he immediately asked Mayor Xu and Secretary-General Sun to explain the process of announcing this news. Mr. Sun awkwardly said, "During the economic conference, I said that according to reports, someone was falsely using the names of Mrs. Yu and Chairman Song to profiteer from grain purchases here. In order to suppress the rising prices, those impersonators should be investigated and prosecuted. My intention was to emphasize the punishment of deceitful merchants who were impersonating officials. However, the next day, a certain newspaper in Hankou published news about Mrs. Yu purchasing grain. This was an out-of-context interpretation, intentionally slandering. Although I am not responsible for this misunderstanding, I would like to express my apology to Minister Yu."</p>
<p>Tit-for-Tat</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Yu asked a reporter from a certain newspaper to explain the situation regarding the news release. For a time, the exchange was tit-for-tat, resembling a confrontation. Mayor Xu stated, "At that time, there were many rumors about rising grain prices. The municipal government investigated the export of grain by the China Grain Corporation, but there was no other malicious intent." Finally, Mr. Yu solemnly stated, "The Control Yuan has already investigated this matter four times. I have also telegraphed the supervisors of the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Food stationed in Hubei and Hunan, as well as the municipal government, to thoroughly investigate. I believe that my wife is a countrywoman and has absolutely no contact with outsiders. As for me, I have always adhered to the principle of not engaging in business while holding office. I have never interacted with merchants in my life, so how could there be any hoarding of grain?</p>
<p>Pursuit by Law</p>
<p>In short, since this is a fabricated matter, Secretary-General Sun, in his capacity as the chief of staff of a special municipality, has slandered a government leader without verifying the facts. He cannot escape legal responsibility. If a concrete response cannot be provided within three weeks to bring this matter to light, I will have no choice but to pursue legal action." Minister Yu also departed for Zhejiang by the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway at 4 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 6th] The food situation in Xi'an is becoming increasingly serious. Recently, the taxes and levies in various grain-producing areas have been exceptionally heavy, with numerous items, causing a sharp increase in transportation costs, which has affected the source of supply, resulting in shortages in the market.

<h3>Five Nations Reach Agreement in Principle on Draft of Western European Alliance Treaty; Military Clauses Not Included in Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Brussels, 6th] It is claimed here that the five nations of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg agreed on the 6th to sign a treaty of economic and political cooperation, and other Western European countries will be invited to participate. Contrary to some speculation, the treaty does not include military clauses. Observers believe the reason for the omission of military clauses may be to make the treaty more attractive to other potential participating countries, such as the Scandinavian nations. British Ambassador to Belgium, Renter, stated that the terms of the treaty were finalized in one session at the meeting in Brussels. It is generally regarded as the cornerstone of the Western European alliance advocated by British Foreign Secretary Bevin to prevent the westward advance of communism. The speed with which this treaty was completed has broken diplomatic history records, mainly because all countries urgently want to present this treaty to the sixteen-nation conference opening in Paris on the 15th of this month. Renter also said that all countries participating in the Marshall Plan will receive invitations to participate in this treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Brussels, 6th] French representative Mably stated that all countries except totalitarian states may participate in this treaty, clearly indicating that Franco cannot participate for the time being. The five-nation European conference on the 6th proceeded in an optimistic and harmonious atmosphere, a situation rarely seen in recent international conferences. Under a clear blue sky and warm spring sunshine, the representatives chatted and laughed as they walked through the garden of the Belgian Foreign Ministry, presenting a scene of joy as they sat around the round table.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 5th] British Foreign Office Assistant Jeb and French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Chauvel, delayed by heavy snow, only arrived in Brussels today with the final draft of the Western European Alliance Treaty drafted by Britain and France. The two will formally present it when the representatives of the five countries reconvene on the 6th. The content of the final draft prepared by Britain and France has not yet been announced, but according to sources close to the British and French delegations, an agreement should not be difficult to reach between the British and French drafts and the suggestions of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. It is said that the provisions of the British and French drafts are much more detailed than the suggestions of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<h3>Three Powers Agree on Unified Economy for West Germany; International Control of Ruhr Area; London Conference Declares End Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] The three-power West German conference of the United States, Britain, and France, lasting two weeks, declared its adjournment today and issued a communiqué stating that agreement had been reached on international co-management of the Ruhr area and close cooperation in registering West German assets for inclusion in the Marshall Plan. According to spokespersons for Britain and the United States, "good progress" has been made on the German production increase plan.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The conference of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to discuss the future status of West Germany effectively concluded today.

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 5th] The protest lodged by Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland regarding the London West German issue conference was rejected by the United States today.

The note reads as follows: "Your note of February 23, 1948, forwarding the content of the declaration on the German issue drafted by the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia at the recent Prague conference, is acknowledged. I hereby inform you that this resolution contains many statements that are inconsistent with the facts, and discussing its content will not be helpful."</p>

Except for fascist groups, people shall have freedom of language, religion, education, speech, and writing. Church schools will be banned. Some observers believe that if the new constitution is passed, the management rights of British and American oil fields in Romania will come to an end.</p>
<h3>Soviet-British Agreement Aids Marshall Plan, US House Committee Opinion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The report submitted today by the House Select Committee on Foreign Aid stated that the Soviet Union, through its British-Soviet trade agreement, helps to improve the position of Britain, and therefore also helps the recovery of Europe, which is a supply for the Marshall Plan. The large inflow of Soviet grain into the world market helps world recovery and can therefore reduce the burden on the United States.</p>
<h3>Taft Opposes Establishing "Super Council"</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Senator Taft stated on the 5th that he opposes the suggestion of establishing a "Super Council" outside the United Nations to deal with aggression with armed forces.

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] TASS reported that President Gottwald met with reporters from the Polish Workers' Daily and stated that Czech foreign policy will continue unchanged.

<h3>Finnish President Drafts Reply to Soviet Union, Prepares for Treaty Negotiations, Unwilling to Conclude Any Military Alliance</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 7th Broadcast: Finnish capital broadcast stated that the leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party declared that the Communist Party's attempt to instigate workers to force the government to conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union has been defeated by the party. The opinions of most workers are consistent with the Finnish Parliament, refusing to conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 5th] Finnish President Paasikivi began drafting a reply today to Stalin's request to conclude a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance.

<p>The government will now accelerate its efforts to preempt demonstrations orchestrated by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, 6th] The Finnish Parliament on the 6th voted in favor of starting treaty negotiations with the Soviet Union, but opposed concluding any military alliance with far-reaching implications.

<h3>President Truman Presides Over Cabinet Meeting, Discussing Major U.S. Policies, Will Take Diplomatic Initiative to Deal with Eastern European Events</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman returned to Washington today after his vacation to deal with major policy decisions, namely whether the United States should conclude a military alliance with Western Europe to resist the Soviet Union. The President is scheduled to convene a cabinet meeting this afternoon, but it has not been announced whether this issue will be on the agenda. However, if the five Western European countries can agree on a mutual defense treaty and propose U.S. participation, then U.S. policy may be decided by the weekend.</p>
<p>At the same time, the urgent situation in Italy must also be taken into account. U.S. officials generally believe that Italy this spring will be the target of Soviet expansion of communist influence west of the Iron Curtain. The issue of military aid to Western Europe has been under informal discussion for several months. Baruch, a veteran politician and financier, proposed to Congress several weeks ago the idea of a military alliance between the United States and the countries participating in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] According to political figures in Washington, recent events such as the coup in Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union's proposal to Finland to conclude an alliance have had a significant impact on the international situation. The U.S. government will soon take a diplomatic initiative to deal with these changes. According to well-informed sources, after taking the diplomatic initiative, a suggestive and clear warning will be issued to the Soviet Union, telling them that the recent events in Czechoslovakia are extremely noteworthy, and if this policy is promoted to other countries, the U.S. government will be forced to change its current attitude and take other effective steps to deal with it. After President Truman returns from Florida, he plans to consult with government cabinet members this afternoon, at which time the general principles of this diplomatic initiative can be decided.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 6th] After the Security Council passed a resolution yesterday authorizing the five powers to consult on the Palestine issue and submit a report within ten days, the first meeting of the five powers was held at 4:00 p.m. today at the new office of the Soviet delegation on Park Avenue. Britain does not plan to participate in this meeting, nor does it plan to participate in the discussion of substantive issues regarding Palestine, but will allocate one representative for other strong representatives to consult. China, one of the five powers, opposes partition, and France has not fully supported the partition plan, so the focus of the discussion should be on U.S. Representative Austin and Soviet Representative Gromyko.</p>

<p>[United Press, Damascus, 5th] General Commander of the Arab Anti-Partition Army, Kaukji, led his column into Palestine on the 5th, established headquarters, and organized troops to fight for the Holy Land. As Kaukji's troops crossed the Syrian border, Arab troops occupying the mountains in Palestine launched diversionary attacks on Jews to attract the main force of the British army.

<h3>Roxas Decides to Fully Suppress Farmer Army Rebellion on Philippine Islands; Said Army is Colluding with Foreign Country</h3>
<p>[United Press Asia Deputy President Vaughn, Manila, 6th] Philippine President Roxas convened an emergency press conference on the 6th to announce the launch of a full-scale campaign to suppress the Hukbalahap (armed peasant rebels) and the National Peasants Union. The two parties are planning to overthrow the government by relying on the aggression of a certain foreign country (probably the Soviet Union). Roxas said he could not prove direct contact between the unlawful entity and Moscow unless it was through the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 6th] President Roxas announced at a special press conference today that the Farmer's Army and the National Peasants Union are illegal organizations, and stated that the Farmer's Army totals 2,000 people and the Labor-Peasant Alliance totals 50,000 people, all of which are communist organizations. The President also displayed secret documents showing the collusion of the two groups with world communism. These documents were captured by government troops and police during the war with the Farmer's Army and included various hand-written orders from Castillo, chairman of the Peasants Union, requesting members to find ways to assassinate Roxas.</p>
<h3>Hull's Memoirs (42) Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance</h3>
<p>— Translated by the Editorial Department of this newspaper</p>
<p>Conditional Application of Unconditional Surrender</p>
<p>The principle of unconditional surrender overshadowed our policies towards the Axis and its satellite states, and our plans for their future.</p>
<p>This principle was not originally conceived by the State Department. We were shocked when Generalissimo announced this principle for the first time in front of the British Prime Minister at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, as was Churchill. I was told that Churchill was dismayed and speechless at the time.</p>
<p>Like many of my colleagues, I fundamentally opposed this principle for two reasons. One reason was that this principle might cause the Axis powers to fight to the death, resisting desperately and prolonging the war.</p>
<p>President himself explained the meaning of unconditional surrender at Casablanca, saying that it was not about destroying the people of Germany, Japan, and Italy, but about ending a theory based on conquering other nations. However, the phrase itself spread more widely than the explanation, becoming a tool in the hands of Nazi propagandists.</p>
<p>The second reason was that this principle logically required the victorious nations to prepare to take over every department of the national and local governments of the conquered countries, and to handle all governmental activities and undertakings. We and our allies were not prepared to undertake such a great obligation.</p>
<p>We in the State Department had begun discussing post-war issues more than three years before the Casablanca Conference, but we had not considered the idea of unconditional surrender. However, after the President explained this principle at Casablanca, we had no choice but to follow it, at least formally.</p>
<p>At the end of December 1943, the British Embassy delivered a memorandum, informing us that peace feelers had reached the British government through Sweden from a high-ranking official of the German Foreign Ministry and Himmler, the chief of Hitler's police. The nature of these feelers was a statement that Himmler was prepared to send an army officer and a Nazi party member to meet with British representatives to learn the definition of the term "unconditional surrender." The British informed us that their plan was to simply reply that the United Nations demanded Germany's unconditional surrender, without further explanation. We agreed to such a reply.</p>
<p>On December 31, when Molotov and Ambassador Harriman spoke, the Soviet Union also raised the issue of unconditional surrender with us. Therefore, after discussing with my colleagues, I submitted a memorandum to the President on January 14, 1944, reporting to him that Molotov had voluntarily mentioned the definition of the phrase "unconditional surrender" to Harriman and inquired about the attitude of our government.</p>
<p>I said: "As far as I know, the Soviet government believes that a definition of surrender terms imposed on the enemy, no matter how broad and severe, is sufficient to deprive the enemy of propaganda benefits, thereby weakening the morale of their army and people. In view of the Soviet Union's concern about this issue, would you allow us to discuss with the governments of the Soviet Union and Great Britain whether to add a public definition to the terms of unconditional surrender imposed on each enemy country, for propaganda purposes?"</p>
<p>Three days later, on January 17, the President replied to me with a memorandum, starting with:</p>
<p>"Frankly, I don't like the idea of discussing the definition of 'unconditional surrender.' The Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States have agreed never to make any peace without consulting each other. I believe that everything should be decided in accordance with this principle."</p>
<p>Then he continued:</p>
<p>"The German people must have heard what I said in my Christmas night speech. In fact, we do not intend to destroy the German people. We want them to live for generations, like other people in Europe, but on one condition: that they must eliminate their current idea of conquest. I can't completely remember what I said at the time, but you can check it.</p>
<p>"Second, the German people and the Soviet Union should also understand what the true meaning of 'unconditional surrender' is. (During the American Civil War) Lee's surrender to Grant is a good illustration. Lee wanted to talk about various conditions. Grant stated: Lee must submit to [Grant's] fairness. So Lee surrendered. Lee immediately raised the issue of the warhorses of the Confederate officers, most of which belonged to them personally. Grant told Lee that they should take the warhorses home for spring plowing, and the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>(The President had a broad knowledge of American history, and he had done in-depth research. But Grant demanded unconditional surrender not at Appomattox, but at Fort Donelson in 1862, when he accepted the surrender of General Buckner.)</p>
<p>The President concluded: "Such small things as mentioned above have a greater effect on the Germans than the many talks held by the Soviets, British, and ourselves to explain 'unconditional surrender.' No matter what words we agree on, once a country wants to surrender, it will probably have to be modified or changed."</p>
<p>On January 25, I informed Ambassador Harriman in Moscow of the main points of this memorandum.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, when the Soviets and Finns discussed peace negotiations, the Russians themselves revised the principle of unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Eden used the Soviet approach to Finland as the basis for a suggestion to us, suggesting that the principle of unconditional surrender be softened for the smaller Axis countries. On March 20, 1944, British Ambassador Halifax handed me a telegram from Eden, containing the above-mentioned information. The date of the telegram was March 17, 1944.</p>
<p>Five days later, I suggested to the President that we should follow the method proposed by the British in order to obtain greater flexibility for the Axis satellite states.</p>
<p>While I was waiting for the President's response to this suggestion, I received a memorandum from Soviet Ambassador Gromyko, stating that his government agreed with the position taken by the British government and the State Department: that the principle of unconditional surrender should be revised.</p>
<p>Before I had a chance to deliver this memorandum to the President, I received his reply to my suggestion of March 25.</p>
<p>He said, "I think this matter should be handled differently. In my judgment, to abandon the words 'unconditional surrender' or make exceptions to it would be a mistake. In fact, to whom do we intend to apply these words? Obviously, our enemies.</p>
<p>"When the Atlantic Charter was established in August 1941 and the Casablanca Conference was held in January 1943, the Axis satellite states were Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland. Although they are also our enemies, they are different in meaning from Germany and Italy. These four small satellite states became our enemies under German-Italian coercion.</p>
<p>"I think it is a mistake to make exceptions. Italy surrendered unconditionally but received many special rights at the same time. The same should happen if Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, or Finland surrender. Lee surrendered unconditionally to Grant, but Grant immediately told him that his officers should take their warhorses home for spring plowing. This is the spirit I want to see overseas, but this spirit does not apply to Germany. Germany only understands one language. Roosevelt."</p>
<p>After receiving the President's reply, several of my colleagues suggested to me in a memorandum that I raise this issue with Roosevelt again. After some discussion, I sent a letter to the President on April 4.</p>
<p>At this time, the President was lying in bed in the White House, suffering from severe bronchitis, and I could not talk to him in person. Therefore, there was a series of written conversations.</p>
<p>The President replied the next day. He said, "I fully understand this issue, but I must prevent people from saying that the principle of unconditional surrender has been abandoned at all costs. If we start making exceptions to the general principle before a special situation occurs, then there will be real danger in it.</p>
<p>"We all know that this danger will inevitably occur if we make any exceptions to the principles that will be applied in all situations in the future.</p>
<p>"I fully understand that there will inevitably be exceptions later, not exceptions to the principle of surrender, but exceptions to the application of the principle of surrender in special circumstances - this is completely different from changing the principle.</p>
<p>"If the Soviet and British governments notify me of such a situation, then I am sure we will agree with them. This should be explained to these two governments. At that time, they cannot accuse us of making the Soviet military mission more difficult. Roosevelt."</p>
<p>But this issue would not die down. Just two days later, from another aspect, namely the military aspect, the issue was raised again. On April 13, 1944, I received a telegram from Under Secretary of State Stettinius, who was then in London, forwarding to me the suggestions made to him by General Eisenhower and General Smith, Eisenhower's Chief of Staff. Stettinius said that these two generals had raised this issue with him and expressed their cautious opinions, believing that we should announce the principles of how the defeated German army would be treated after surrendering, in order to clarify the meaning of unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>I sent this telegram to the President, who was resting at Baruch Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina, due to a minor illness.</p>
<p>On April 15, I received a short message from the President, mentioning Stettinius' telegram of April 13 and saying: "Any reply to this telegram must be sent out only after my approval."</p>
<p>On April 17, I telegraphed Philipp, asking him to inform everyone concerned that the President hoped that this issue would not be given further consideration without his consent.</p>
<p>The President returned to Washington on May 7. Three days later, I sent a memorandum on this issue to the President. I said: The State Department has received a notification from the British Embassy, stating that the British government believes it is very important for the Allies to carry out propaganda against the satellite states. This propaganda, especially against Hungary and Bulgaria, should henceforth delete the term "unconditional surrender" in order to obtain the maximum military benefits in strengthening the resistance against Germany. There will be no abandonment of the general principle.</p>
<p>I said, "In making this suggestion, the British Embassy pointed out that the Soviet government did not apply this principle to Finland, and if Romania ceased fire according to their surrender proposal, then the Soviet government could also not apply this principle to Romania. It is generally assumed that propaganda agencies will consider these issues when preparing their instructions. Regarding Hungary and Bulgaria, the State Department believes that it would be beneficial to take vigorous action on propaganda at this time. Therefore, I would be grateful if you would indicate whether you will allow us to take parallel actions with the British and Soviets, granting some freedom of action for propaganda."</p>
<p>The President sent the memorandum back to me, with the words "OK" written on it.</p>
<p>The repeated statements issued by the leaders of the three major Allied powers softened the interpretation of unconditional surrender, but did not lead to Germany's early surrender. The Nazi propaganda machine continued to the end, emphasizing its rigid interpretation of unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>Whether Germany would have surrendered sooner if the principle of unconditional surrender had not been announced, or if the conditions agreed upon and declared by the United Nations had been more lenient, remains a question.</p>
<p>In any case, continuing to apply unconditional surrender to Germany did have this effect: that future German propaganda agencies could never again claim, as they did in the 1920s and 1930s, that the German army was not defeated, and that Germany's defeat was due to the weakness of the rear civil administration and the people.</p>
<p>As for our eastern enemy, Japan, she surrendered three months later, when she saw that the principle of unconditional surrender could be applied conditionally. (End)</p>

<h3>The Municipal Assembly Concluded Last Night. The Multiple of Rent Was Determined and Passed. It Will Be Implemented This Month Based on 7,000 Times and 9,000 Times the 26th Year of the Republic of China. Adjusted Every Six Months.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The 5th session of the first Municipal Assembly was held for a total of twelve days. After holding the tenth and eleventh meetings separately yesterday morning and afternoon, it came to a satisfactory conclusion at 9:30 pm. Among the proposals of greatest concern to citizens in this meeting, in addition to the decision to cancel the electricity saving fine which was resolved a few days ago, the rent issue was also discussed in the assembly yesterday, and a solution was reached after an hour and a half. Several points were decided: (1) The Municipal Assembly decided that a maximum rent should be set. (2) The maximum amount is: the rent for commercial properties should be increased by 9,000 times compared to the 26th year of the Republic of China, and the rent for residential properties should be increased by 7,000 times. (3) The above measures will be implemented from this month and adjusted every six months. (4) The rent for public education personnel will no longer be calculated at 80% of the rate, but will be handled in accordance with the newly set amount. After the rent issue was decided, the housing tax could also be resolved. It was resolved that: (1) The housing tax will be collected from the landlord based on the actual rent received. (2) The tax rate will still be collected at the original maximum tax rate, 5% of the rent for residential use and 10% for commercial use.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned maximum rent, it was set by Vice Chairman Xu based on the previously set 180 times and 140 times the rent, plus 50 times, that is, 9,000 times and 7,000 times the rent in the 26th year of the Republic of China. In other words, a commercial property that cost 10 yuan before the war now costs 90,000 yuan, and a residential property now costs 70,000 yuan. During the discussion, none of the participating assembly members agreed to set the standard "according to the cost of living index," but most agreed that a standard should be set. Feng Youzhen and He Chengfu fundamentally did not advocate setting a rent standard. Li Wenjie, Jiang Pingfan, Zhu Wende, Ma Shaoji, Wang Wei, etc. stated that according to the Housing Lease Regulations, this case should be sent back to the Municipal Government, because the Municipal Government sent it to the Municipal Assembly for agreement. If the Municipal Assembly does not agree, it will be sent back for revision, and the Municipal Assembly has no right to set the standard. However, most assembly members believed that they had the right to set it. At the same time, the term "standard" was unreasonable. After inquiring with Director Zhu, he also replied that "standard" was a mistake for "maximum amount." Many assembly members agreed to set a maximum amount, but each person proposed a different multiple. Zhang Zhongyuan advocated 4,000 to 8,000 times, Shi Zongde advocated 5,000 to 15,000 times, and for pre-war rents of less than 10 yuan, 3,000 to 6,000 times, Xi Xiading 3,500 times. Feng Youzhen and Fei Shusheng advocated freezing the rent according to the rent in January, and Jiang Haoran advocated freezing the rent according to the rent in December. Mayor Wu immediately suggested organizing a committee to discuss after the closing of the meeting, and it is especially necessary to formulate a method to sanction unreasonable profiteering by secondary landlords, but this was not agreed to by the Assembly. As a result, people such as Tao Baichuan and Yang Gongshu all agreed with the opinion of the Vice Chairman, and it was passed after a vote.</p>
<h3>A Round of Applause. Support for Zhu Ping. The Warning Case Was Immediately Withdrawn.</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] After the rent issue was decided in the Assembly yesterday, Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, formally expressed his agreement and said that it could be submitted by the Municipal Government. He also said that the decision would be strictly implemented in the future. If there are difficulties in implementation, the court can preside over it. If it still cannot be done well, then he is willing to ask for punishment (the assembly members present applauded enthusiastically and repeatedly). The original proposal by Assemblyman Tang Shichang and others, to "warn Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, who disregards the interests of the public, by this Assembly," immediately declared its withdrawal, and some assembly members requested that the withdrawal be changed to support, causing a burst of laughter. The warning case was then decided to be withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Various Tax Rates Were Amended and Approved. The Municipal Construction Donation for Automobiles Will Increase in the Second Half of the Year. Scientific Organizations' Own Production Is Exempt from Taxes.</h3>
<p>Finance Part: (1) Regarding the detailed rules for six types of tax revenue: banquets, entertainment, slaughter, business licenses, use licenses, and housing donations, the Mayor submitted them for discussion and requested the Assembly to approve their implementation. Among them, the detailed rules for collection were fully passed by the Assembly based on the revision opinions of the special regulations committee. The tax rates for each tax were discussed and slightly amended by the Assembly before being passed. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Banquet tax - remains at the original tax rate of 15%. (2) Entertainment tax - remains at the original tax rate, i.e., 20% for dramas and 25% for all others. (3) Slaughter tax - remains at the original tax rate of 5%. (4) Business license tax - remains at the original tax rate until the case of submitting a request to the central government for revocation is approved, with a maximum of 3‰.

<p>(2) Business tax, there is a case "The business tax rate is doubled, and merchants are unable to bear it. Please earnestly forward the case to the central government to maintain the old tax rate for taxation." Solution: 1. Telegraph to the central government to revise the business tax law again to restore the original tax rate of 1.5% and 4%. 2. Consult the Municipal Government and order the Finance Bureau to temporarily collect the business tax rate for the 37th year of the Republic of China at the original tax rate. Resolution passed.</p>
<p>(3) The Mayor submitted a case "Intending to adjust the donation amount for the municipal construction of automobiles." Resolution: It is proposed that the Assembly pass the case as it is, that is, increase it by two times starting in the second half of the year, with a total annual amount of 64.8 billion. A letter will also be sent to the Engineering and Social Affairs Bureaus to explain in detail the use of the donation in the second half of the 36th year of the Republic of China. Also, starting from this year, the use of the donation will be determined as three-quarters for engineering affairs and one-quarter for social affairs.</p>
<p>(4) A letter was sent to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Finance to tentatively reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Bank with reference to the organizational regulations of the Provincial Bank before the central government promulgates the organizational regulations for the Municipal Bank under the jurisdiction of the Central Government.</p>
<p>(5) "The local real estate tax should be waived for scientific organizations' own houses and properties." Resolution: Handled according to the preferential treatment example for charitable organizations' houses. Also, a temporary proposal "It is proposed to forward to the Central Government to order the Municipal Government to order the Finance Bureau to revoke the annual business license tax to avoid duplicate collection and alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants." Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>Also, the Mayor submitted a case "Based on the report of the Finance Bureau, it is proposed to discuss the outline of the simplified collection of business tax in Shanghai." Resolution: Passed in principle. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Assembly, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce shall each appoint responsible representatives to form a committee to formulate implementation measures, submit them to the central government for record, and implement them on a trial basis on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Manure Can Only Be Dumped During Limited Hours. Garbage Is Transferred to Fertilizer.</h3>
<p>Health Part: (1) "Please stipulate the time for dumping manure to emphasize sanitation, and stipulate the monthly collection fee to avoid disturbing citizens." Resolution: A letter shall be sent to the Municipal Government to order the Health Bureau to urge its subordinates to complete the dumping within the originally stipulated time and pay attention to the extra demands of the manure collectors. (2) "It is proposed to suggest that the Health Bureau set up garbage dumping stations in the far suburbs so that waste can be utilized and transferred to farmland fertilizer." Resolution: A letter shall be sent to the Municipal Government to order the Health Bureau to implement it conscientiously. (3) "The locations in various small vegetable markets in the city are mostly occupied by small shops. It is proposed that the Health Bureau ban them to match the name with reality and submit it for public decision." Resolution: This case is sent to the Health Bureau for conscientious implementation of the market management regulations. (4) "It is proposed to suggest that the Health Bureau change the Grade C health center in Xinjing District to Grade B and quickly set up branches in important towns to facilitate medical treatment for patients and lying-in women." Resolution: It is suggested that the Health Bureau increase the number of medical personnel at its discretion according to the progress of the Health Affairs Office. The principle is to transfer them. (5) "It is proposed to establish health work in schools in this city and submit it for public decision." Resolution: 1. Passed in principle, a letter shall be sent to the Municipal Government for reference. 2.

Resolution: Passed in principle, a letter shall be sent to the Municipal Government for handling.</p>

Resolution: (1) All four items are passed in principle. (2) The Assembly authorizes the Urban Planning Review Committee and the Public Works Committee of the Assembly to immediately and carefully study this case together with the review opinions.

Resolution: 1. This plan is passed in principle. 2. For the implementation of this plan, the Municipal Government should be requested to use the land requisition method to implement the plan in stages, and the original landowners have the right to prioritize.</p>

<p>Regarding the cases of "The soaring prices in this city make it difficult for public and educational personnel to maintain a living, please find ways to provide relief" and the ad hoc motion "Prices in Shanghai are constantly changing, it is proposed that the municipal government appropriately increase the salaries of public and educational personnel," both were combined for discussion and resolved: This council is deeply concerned about the meager salaries and difficult living conditions of public and educational personnel in this city. This case is approved in principle and sent to the municipal government to promptly find sources of funding and improve salaries as much as possible. It was further resolved to approve the organization of a "Resolution Review Committee" to review the implementation of resolutions from the previous four general meetings, and to suggest that the Executive Yuan order the Materials Supply Bureau to quickly dispose of surplus materials and abolish the bureau within a time limit.</p>
<p>Increasing Education Funding</p>
<p>In addition, the more important proposals included: (1) The Speaker submitted a proposal to approve the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the police department's order to dismantle neon lights within six months, requesting correction and prevention. It was resolved that neon lights running parallel to traffic lights at intersections should change their colors, while all others should remain as they are. (2) A proposal to increase the city's education funding to 35% of the total municipal budget to comply with the constitution and benefit education.

(3) The Speaker submitted a proposal to approve the telegram from the preparatory committee of the National Grain Federation, requesting exemption from grain business tax. It was resolved to recommend that the government exempt it. (4) Regarding the general budget of revenue and expenditure of Shanghai City for the 37th year, the conveners of the Budget and Final Accounts Committee, Xu Yongzuo, He Yuanming, and Li Wenjie, submitted a written report and proposed the capacity to review budgets and additional expenditures in the future, which was approved by the General Assembly. As for the security police, it was decided to temporarily increase the number by 1,000. The mounted patrol team should also be included in this 1,000 as much as possible. In addition, regarding the initiation of a large-scale fundraising campaign to assist the United Nations in soliciting donations for child relief, the municipal government is requested to handle it appropriately.</p>
<h3>Two City Councilors - A Dispute</h3>
<p>[Our report] Yesterday, before the Shanghai City Council meeting in the morning, councilors Qu Yue and Zhong Yuliang suddenly had a verbal conflict, almost leading to physical violence. Fortunately, the speaker and deputy speaker intervened, preventing the escalation of the situation. Recently, 2,000 residents of Gaoqiao District jointly requested the removal of Qu. Qu had already published a statement in various newspapers the day before yesterday. Yesterday, when he met Zhong Yuliang, the head of Gaoqiao District, he asked, "The residents of Gaoqiao District are recalling me. You are the district head. Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Zhong replied, "I think you are not doing a good job as a councilor, so they want to recall you." Upon hearing this, Qu became even more angry. Zhong then loudly said, "Please maintain order in the meeting place!" Qu said, "The meeting hasn't started yet, this is not the meeting place." The two sides were at odds. Qu Yue rushed forward and said, "I have now changed to Yangjing District. The residents of Gaoqiao District cannot recall me." Zhong also refused to back down, saying, "We insist on recalling you, so what?" At this time, the speaker and others were nearby and intervened to mediate, and the dispute was finally resolved.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zengjue Expresses Weariness - Mayor Wu Earnestly Urges Him to Stay</h3>
<p>Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, has repeatedly submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu due to the difficult times and difficult measures, feeling exhausted and wanting to give way to others. Mayor Wu believes that Zhao has been in charge of the city's public works for more than two years, working hard and actively promoting progress with great success. In addition to repeatedly approving and urging him to stay, he has also earnestly urged him to remain in his position.</p>
<h3>Request to the U.S. Government - Implement Full-Scale Aid to China - Translated Telegram to Be Sent This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our report] The telegram to the U.S. government, decided by the City Council the day before yesterday, requesting full-scale aid to China, has been translated into English and will be sent out this morning. The original telegram reads: "President Truman of the United States, Secretary of State Marshall, Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, and Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Appropriations Committee, and Military Committee: The Chinese government's efforts to contain the spread of communist rebels are a war to maintain international justice and world peace, and are unavoidable for safeguarding China's independence and freedom. Only an independent, free, peaceful, and unified China standing tall in the Far East, not swept away by totalitarian communism, can ensure that the peace and happiness of the world's people and the democratic and free way of life on both sides of the Pacific Ocean are spared from destruction. However, since the Chinese government and people endured a long war of resistance against Japan, the national strength is exhausted, and the people's livelihood is impoverished. We are currently in a serious situation and cannot but hope for your country's urgent assistance. The current problem in China, as stated by General MacArthur and General Wedemeyer, is indeed only a military problem. Therefore, your country must strengthen military assistance in addition to economic aid to China in order to be effective. If the ammunition, food, clothing, and other supplies necessary for the Chinese communist suppression troops can be continuously provided by your country without affecting the country's regular budget, we dare to believe that not only can the suppression of communist forces in China be completed sooner, but also the trend of inflation can be stopped, and it will not be difficult for the national economy to recover its balance. At the same time, we must give full play to public opinion and supervise the government to promote the active implementation of domestic reforms in coordination with your country's aid to China. Saving the sick and fighting fire must be timely. If the medicine is not right or the water power is insufficient, it will not be enough to relieve the difficulties of those waiting to be rescued. China is currently in urgent need of your country's military and economic assistance, just as described above. This council hereby makes a sincere appeal to your country on behalf of the five million citizens of Shanghai. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai City Council; Xu Jiyin, Deputy Speaker; March 6."</p>
<p>Mayor Visits Rice Shops in Various Districts to Inspect Rice Quality. (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Mayor's Inspection Tour - Caring for People's Food - Inquiring About Rice Distribution in Various Districts - Praising Yangshupu District for Excellent Performance</h3>
<p>[Our report] Mayor Wu attaches great importance to the city-wide rice distribution. Yesterday morning, he went to various districts for inspection accompanied by Ren Xianqun, Director of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Director of the News Department. Starting at 8:30 a.m. from the Mayor's residence, he first went to the Jing'an District Office. District Chief Jin Dehuan reported that all the certificates for the first half of the month had been distributed, and the receipt books were verified to be correct.</p>
<h3>Knocking on Doors to Visit Residents - Housewife Was Getting Ready - Repeatedly Said "Sorry"</h3>
<p>Accompanied by District Chief Jin, he went to No. 12 Bao, Zhaojiaqiao Road, Changde Road, and inquired from Yu Weichang's official residence, Zengfang, Yichang Meat Shop, and others. Many residents said they had received the rice purchase permits. The Mayor asked them to show the distributed rice after seeing it, and asked, "Is the rice quality good?" The distributed rice was white and solid, and the residents replied, "Good." Then he went to Xieda Public Rice Shop on Changde Road to inquire about the distribution of rice. He also knocked on the door of resident No. 281 and asked if they had received the distribution certificate. The housewife was just getting up to get ready. The Mayor said, "Sorry." After inquiring and confirming that they had also received the distribution certificate, he urged them to go to the rice shop to buy rice with the certificate before the 12th.</p>
<h3>Shuttle Visit on Main Road</h3>
<p>The group then went to the Laozha District Office, accompanied by District Chief Li Ruchun. They first went to the New World Company, but the company was not yet open for business. So they crossed to the opposite Jiu Feng Silk Shop to inquire, and were told that they had received the distribution certificate. The manager of the silk shop, seeing the Mayor personally investigating, repeatedly praised him for "diligence in government and love for the people" and "wise Mayor". Then they went to the neighboring Shengxifu Hat Factory and Shurenyu Chinese Medicine Shop to inquire. These two households had not yet received the distribution certificate. The Mayor urged them to urge the Bao Chief to get it quickly. Then they crossed the road in Renjin Middle Road to the opposite Taikang Biscuit Company and Daguangming Clock and Glasses General Store to inquire, and all had received the distribution certificate. Then they walked from Lloyd Road to Xizang Road to check the distribution situation of Tongchang Rice. At that time, citizens buying rice with special certificates were very enthusiastic in front of the door. The Mayor verified that the displayed rice samples were the same as the rice sold to the citizens, and then left happily. He drove straight to the old city center, Xinxin Street, where District Chief Cai Fushan reported that the purchase certificates had been issued to 52% of the residents and accompanied him to Yangjiabang Town on Mayushan Road to inspect. The Mayor inquired from the residents one by one.</p>
<h3>Rice Sold Out - Mayor Satisfied</h3>
<p>Then he went to Yangshupu District. The rice distribution situation in this district was the best. All the distribution certificates had been issued, and most of the rice shops had the words "Rice Sold Out, More Will Be Sold Later" written in front of their doors. The Mayor was satisfied with the district and repeatedly praised it. Later, after hearing that many residents of Tilanqiao District had not received the distribution certificates, he drove to the district office to investigate. After checking the books, he saw that the Bao Chiefs had taken the purchase certificates in many ways, and five Baos had not received the certificates at all. Mayor Wu repeatedly urged the staff of the district office to treat this matter as the most important thing and to pay attention to it in the future and not to neglect it. He also went to the Jiang Qiaoxing Longevity Shop in the First Bao Office of the district to inspect and instructed the Bao Chief to issue the certificates quickly.</p>
<h3>Hoping Citizens - Openly Review</h3>
<p>It was 11:45 at this point, and because he had to attend the City Council meeting, he ended the inspection. Mayor Wu said: The distribution of rice in March was done for the first time, and difficulties and shortcomings were unavoidable. He believed that the process would be greatly improved when it was done in April. He hoped that the district government investigation team decided by the City Council would be established soon and go to various districts to supervise rice distribution. All colleagues in the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Food Allocation Committee should do their best to urge the Bao and Jia Chiefs near their residences, and hoped that citizens would openly review the process. He would also go to various districts for inspection with Mr. Jimeide, the head of the American China Relief Mission, to step up supervision.</p>
<p>According to the statement to reporters by Chairman Ren: The civil food allocation committee determined that the distribution certificate for the second half of the month would be issued to the district offices for distribution before the 8th.</p>
<h3>Short of More Than One Jin of Rice - Thorough Investigation of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Our report] The No. 2 and No. 8 groups of the Laisai District, which belong to the South Rice Market and are responsible for selling rice allocated by population, issued 3,549 bags of rice from the Taikoo Warehouse of the China Trust Bureau the day before yesterday, which were distributed to various rice shops for sale. It was found that each two bags were short of half a kilogram, totaling 1,744 kilograms. According to regulations, the rice transportation company is responsible for the compensation. Yesterday, the rice company appealed to the Civil Food Allocation Committee and sent personnel to negotiate with the food warehouse. The food warehouse believed that the goods had been weighed and left the warehouse, and the shortage was not pointed out at the time, so it did not admit it. It is reported that the authorities are paying great attention to this matter and have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate it. The China Trust Bureau will be requested to announce the figures of Taikoo's warehouse entry and exit, and will jointly open and lock the warehouse to check whether there is a surplus after the storage of rice is completed, in order to prove whether there is any embezzlement.</p>
<h3>Speaker's Closing Remarks - Praising the Spirit of the Assembly - Treating Matters, Not People, is the Foundation of Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>[Our report] The closing ceremony of the Council was held last night. After the ceremony, Speaker Pan delivered the closing remarks, saying: During this meeting, everyone was able to discuss various important issues with all their efforts and achieved considerable results. Although some proposals were not properly handled due to the rush of time, everyone can be satisfied with their spirit. The maximum rent discussed at the last meeting has also been reasonably resolved. Although there may be difficulties in implementation in the future, it is believed that the government can do its best to implement it. In addition, the factory establishment address and zoning cases formulated by the municipal government are also very important and have a close relationship with urban progress and current industry. Therefore, they are specially submitted to the Urban Planning Committee and the Public Works Committee for review, which shows that we dare not neglect or make hasty decisions on cases related to citizens. In the public utilities sector, although public utilities have been criticized for repeated price increases, it is believed that this kind of criticism is directed at the matter and not at the person. The fact that the Land Administration Director finally understood a little about the rent issue can prove this. Therefore, the same is true for Director Zhao. The system of fines for exceeding the limit of electricity consumption was also cancelled due to the cooperation of the competent authorities. Although matters of this kind have not been completed to take care of the citizens, they can at least relieve or reduce some of the suffering of the citizens. In terms of public security, it was also possible to establish a garrison brigade under the current economic difficulties. There is no need to repeat the resolutions of other departments.</p>
<p>In short, I hope that everyone will always be able to encourage themselves with the spirit of this conference, that is, "to deal with things and not people." This is the foundation of true democratic politics. Criticize as much as possible during the discussion, and the other party should listen with generosity. When implementing, they must abandon personal prejudices and obey the decisions of the participants. I hope that this spirit will be promoted.</p>
<p>In terms of international affairs, this Council has sent a telegram to the American public and private sectors. The American public and private sectors have always valued the opinions of the Chinese people, and I believe that they will respect the opinions of this Council.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Expresses Hope</p>
<p>Mayor Wu’s arrival speech said that being able to engage in public relations and criticism in the Council is the best phenomenon. Because of openness, criticism, and improvement, these three are the spirit of doing things. In the recent three months, the municipal government especially needs to make public the household registration rice allocation system. I inspected various districts this morning and was quite satisfied, but I still think that some places are slow to do things. Finally, the Mayor hoped that the Council would assist the municipal government and supervise the municipal government so that municipal administration would be satisfactory. At the same time, the colleagues of the municipal government are willing to follow the spirit of openness and criticism of everyone to achieve a model of democratic politics.</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan Feels Progress</p>
<p>Councilor Tao Baichuan delivered a speech on behalf of the Councilors, saying that the end of the five meetings made me feel that the Council is progressing more than the previous one. (1) The human resources have increased more than before. After the Councilors of the Youth Party joined, they jointly discussed proposals representing the interests of the people in the Council without participating in a political party position. This wise attitude is the success of this Council, and this Council has expanded its momentum and can better serve the people and assist the government. (2) This time, the questioning of the General Assembly used oral rather than written form, which is also a characteristic. (3) The Human Rights Protection Committee organized by this Council strives for the freedom, equality, and life protection of the people. This Council respects the personality of the military and police very much, because of deep love and expectation. (4) The rent problem was solved due to the motion of Deputy Speaker Xu. Although the interests of a small number of landlords are reduced, I hope they can consider protecting the interests of the majority of the people.</p>
<h3>Passed the Establishment of a Human Rights Protection Committee - Unanimous Indignation at Existing Facts - Economic Police Want to Arrest Councilors</h3>
<p>Yesterday's General Assembly also passed the establishment of a Human Rights Protection Committee, and its actions are: (1) The councilors of this Council will jointly elect 11 people to form a Human Rights Protection Committee. (2) During the recess, they will be stationed to handle people's complaints and urge the administrative organs to legally transfer the arrested people. (3) If the people are arrested on suspicion and the authorities violate the constitution and fail to transfer them to the judiciary within the time limit, the victims are allowed to come to the meeting at any time to file a complaint and correct it immediately. The 11 members of the committee were elected as Li Wenjie, Chen Baotai, Qu Yue, Feng Youzhen, Hou Jiyuan, Jiang Huaixu, Xu Yongzuo, Zhao Junhao, Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Pingfan, and Zhang Zhongyuan. The Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and the supervisors elected by the Council are ex officio members.</p>
<p>When the case was discussed, Councilor Yu Rupin reported that yesterday afternoon, several economic policemen suddenly came to the South Goods Store opened by him, forcibly searched it, copied out two gold bracelets worn by his adult and the receipts issued by a friend for borrowing gold two years ago, and pointed them out as illegal evidence. Although Yu stated that he was a councilor and had to attend the meeting, the police insisted on arresting Yu. After notifying Director Yu by telegram, although the Director-General notified him to withdraw, the police still ignored it. Yu said that the police are like this to the councilors, and the average people cannot imagine it. He asked to uphold justice. At the same time, Speaker Pan also reported that after he received Yu's phone call, he called the police to go away in the phone and informed the other party that he was the Speaker of the Council, and had held the position ten times, and told him that, except for criminals caught in the act, the city councilors cannot be arrested or detained during the meeting without the permission of the City Council. The other party still claimed that they could not hear and did not know who the Speaker was. After reprimanding him and saying that he would sue to the Mayor for punishment, he left. All the Councilors in the hall were extremely indignant after hearing this and demanded that the Mayor investigate and punish severely. The Mayor immediately guaranteed to investigate and handle it.</p>

<h3>Smuggled Goods Seized on the Zhawa Ship - Falsely Claimed to be Embassy Luggage - Ten Large Wooden Boxes - Worth Tens of Billions</h3>
<p>Recently, the Pei Ji Bu Ge ship of the Dutch Zhawa Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The Jianghai Customs received a tip-off in advance that the ten pieces of luggage and furniture listed in the import manifest of the ship were suspected of smuggling private goods in the name of the embassy. Officials were dispatched to detain the ten large wooden boxes of luggage during unloading and jointly opened the boxes with the consignee of the goods, Ping Zhiming Yanghang, for inspection. A large number of valuable woolen fabrics, cigarettes, saccharin, and radio light bulbs were found inside, with an estimated total value of approximately 6-70 billion yuan. The case is currently under further investigation by the Jianghai Customs.</p>

<h3>Collusion with a Lawyer to Report Traitors - Blackmail for Huge Sums of Money</h3>
<p>[Our report] Tang Songrong, the owner of Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, resides at No. 2, Lane 168, Wuxing Road, and has factories in Binlang Road and Xietu Road. Feng Zhen, 38 years old, from Yuyao, resides at his relative's home at No. 31, Lane 434, Beijing West Road. During the enemy puppet period, he worked for the Japanese company Takebayashi Yanghang and knew Tang. Feng had been unemployed for a long time and, knowing that Tang was wealthy, colluded with his friend Zhou Yiqing (34 years old, residing at No. 100, Qufu Road) to extort Tang.</p>
<p>First, Feng had repeatedly gathered in Room 303 of the Central Hotel to discuss the matter. Finally, they went to Suzhou together and colluded with Cao Mingchuan, a lawyer at No. 38, Wuqufang, Suzhou, and Huang Yunpeng, a dismissed employee of the Minsu News Agency. Feng Yixin, three people, were drafted by Cao to accuse Tang of treason to the Jiangsu Provincial High Procuratorate. After the office accepted it, it transferred it to the Shanghai High Procuratorate for review, and it is currently under investigation. On the morning of the 25th of last month, Feng Zhen suddenly went to Tang's residence in Wuxing Road and posted slogans accusing Tang of treason. He happened to be seen by a police officer from Changshu Road Police Station, who stepped forward to interfere. Feng showed the receipt of the complaint and was released. At the end of last month, Tang reported to the Changshu Road Police Station that he was being blackmailed. After investigation by the police station, Feng Zhen, Cao Mingchuan, Feng Yixin, and Zhou Yiqing were arrested. According to their confession, they planned to extort 200 gold bars from Tang, but later changed it to 4 billion yuan, and had met several times. The investigation of the case has now been completed, and all the criminals were sent to the Local Procuratorate yesterday for punishment.</p>
<h3>"True and False Wives" Case Opens - Two Defendants are Far Away in the United States - Bank Director Sues for Injustice - Denies Selling Wife to Help Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Our report] The "True and False Wives" case opened for the first time in the Third Criminal Court of the Local Court yesterday afternoon. The defendants, Xie Jiashu and Gao Qinqiu, who are in charge of the consulate in San Francisco, did not arrive because they were in the United States. Xu Liangyi, the director of the Nanshi Branch of the Shanghai City Bank, and the complainant, Li Yunyi, arrived yesterday. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs once entrusted a lawyer to bring a letter to the court to prove that Xie Gao had a marital relationship. However, Li strongly denounced his false claim that Xie Gao had never taken a day off or entertained a guest when he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and that his marriage certificate was forged. After Gao Chang received 800 US dollars in travel expenses, he handed it over to Xu to do business. Xu Liangyi argued that he had divorced Gao Qinqiu long ago. Because Gao had nowhere to live after coming to Shanghai, he lived in the house allocated to him. When reporting to the household registration, he still reported the head of household as Xu Liangyi, and he did not know it at all. He is a man of status and would not sell a wife for 800 US dollars. He was accused of helping embezzlement, which is a real injustice. The court believes that this case requires the return of Xie Jiashu and Gao Qinqiu, who are in the United States, to the country for questioning before it can be clarified. It was ordered to change the date for retrial.</p>
<h3>Labor Relief Committee Reviews Work - Increases Wages and Food Expenses</h3>
<p>All Winter Relief Shelters Will End by the End of April</p>
<p>[Our report] The Labor Relief Committee of the Winter Relief Association convened a discussion with the directors of the labor relief shelters and the engineers of the engineering districts of the Public Works Bureau at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. Li Jianhua presided over the review of the labor relief work. It was decided that the daily rice supply for labor relief refugees will still be maintained at 28 taels, and the food expenses will be increased from 120,000 yuan to 160,000 yuan from March 1. The wages for digging earth will be increased to 20,000 yuan per cubic meter from the 8th. In order to encourage work, it was decided that each person's daily work should be based on 1.5 cubic meters as the standard. If there is any excess, the excess work will be calculated in proportion to the wage increase of 20,000 yuan per cubic meter for every half cubic meter.</p>
<p>According to Yuan Wenzhang, Director of the Fourth Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, all the winter relief shelters have been scheduled to close at the end of April, and the refugees will be scattered or other means will be found to accommodate them and provide relief.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read in your esteemed newspaper about the requisitioning of the Hardoon Garden case in the City Council, and there is a significant difference between what was reported and my original remarks and views. I stated at the time that whether or not Hardoon Garden should be requisitioned or donated was still undecided, but requests for building libraries, art galleries, gazetteer halls, and even primary schools had already come one after another, which I found very strange. During the discussion of this case in the previous session of the council, I mentioned that the reason for the reservation was to inquire about the opinion of the Executive Yuan regarding whether or not it could be requisitioned. Later, the Executive Yuan replied that it could be requisitioned, and if it were to be requisitioned, it must be done in accordance with the law. As for the so-called 570 billion, since the owner has not yet formally proposed it, why should we worry about it on their behalf? At the same time, there are many rumors circulating outside about this case. Even Mayor Wu, during his recent report, said that some people were suspicious. How could we possibly doubt Mayor Wu? All my colleagues in the council are people of high character and representatives of the public. How can we make reckless speculations? However, I object to ordering the Hardoon owner to donate land for theater construction because of the council's advocacy for rent collection or requisition. Such a result would be tantamount to a blackmail-style exchange condition. That was roughly what I said at the time. I respectfully request that this letter be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth. I am deeply grateful. Respectfully, Zhang Zhihan</p>

<h3>"Double Gun" Sister Ba Arrives in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Director Liang Qiang inspected the highways of the Hangzhou Engineering Office. Mr. Shou Chang and I participated in this trip. We transferred from Shao Dian to Zha Pu, and it was already dusk when we arrived. We stayed at the Haifeng Hotel, which is the best hotel in Xi Pu. The rooms were spacious, but the furnishings were a little simple. I asked the tea server: "Where does a Ms. Wang Ba Mei live in this area?" He said that she is the owner of this hotel. I wanted to visit this legendary figure from the War of Resistance, but the tea server told me that she had gone to Ping Hu.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 5th] Last summer, a young man named Lin Zhao Guo, the secretary of the Haining Youth League, came to tell me that their Ten District Youth League Association had held a meeting in Zha Pu and met "Double Gun" Sister Ba. He told me how hospitable and chivalrous she was. He also said that he could introduce me to see her in Wu Pu and that he could accompany me.</p>
<p>Legendary Hotel Owner</p>
<p>In early autumn last year, the First District Highway Bureau... [Sentence incomplete in original.] In early winter last year, Shou Chang, An E, Zhang Ruifang, Ying Yunwei, and others came to see me in Hangzhou via Zha Pu from Shanghai. They said that they had indeed met Wang Ba Mei to discuss filming the "Tide of the Qiantang River" movie. They described her as forthright, frank, and enthusiastic. They also said that she was short, very sturdy, with a copper-colored complexion, and clearly weathered by the elements.</p>
<p>Brave Subordinates, Intimidated Enemies</p>
<p>Some say Wang Ba Mei protected salt boats before the war. Later, when the war started, she organized a guerrilla force to fight against the Japanese invaders. Of course, she lacked weapons and money, but all her subordinates were very brave and truly killed Japanese devils. In the moment before victory, she even commanded a convoy, consisting of three battalions and nine companies. She roamed the coasts and rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, active on the land of Jiangnan, causing headaches and annoyance for the Japanese enemy. Many stories about her are quite legendary. For example, the tea server at the Haifeng Hotel told us that one day, Commander Huang was surrounded by many enemies. She crouched down, pulled out two pistols, and fired several shots, finally killing several enemies, while the rest of the enemies ran away in fright.</p>
<p>Not long ago, newspapers reported that Wang Ba Mei's subordinates had defected and fled to the Haikou and Siming Mountain areas, establishing communication lines. However, shortly thereafter, Gong Ba Mei came out to declare that this was not true and pointed out that those traitors were definitely not her subordinates.</p>
<p>Busy in War, Pilgrimage to Sacred Mountains</p>
<p>Many female soldiers originally served under her command. However, after the victory, some got married, and others returned home. After the victory, her troops were reduced from three battalions to one battalion, and one battalion was reorganized into a security police company. The remaining demobilized officers and soldiers mostly went into business or farming. She herself opened the Haifeng Hotel and several shops in Zha Pu. In the Huangshan scenic area, she built a tavern. In Zha Pu town, she founded a complete primary school that can accommodate more than 300 students. She also maintained the coastal lighthouse for ships sailing in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>She is a devout Buddhist. Even though she was busy with the war during the eight years of resistance, she always made pilgrimages to sacred mountains. Now, her main activity is to worship Bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Ding Xisan's Bandit Group's Deployment</p>
<p>Recently, Wang Ba Mei came to Hangzhou, along with the Ping Hu County Magistrate. Chairman Shen met with her and hosted a banquet for her. Deputy Commander of Security Zhu Ming Cou also hosted a banquet for her. According to her, this visit was for the purpose of burning incense. According to people in the provincial government, Chairman Shen asked about her when he went to Ping Hu. This time, she came to pay her respects to Chairman Shen. The Chairman's banquet for her was a gesture of courtesy. When talking about Ding Xisan, she said that many bandits initially came to deploy and incite the hard-working masses, urging them to join the "struggle". Ding Xisan originally intended to land at Jinshanwei in Ping Hu, but later changed his plans temporarily and landed in Fengxian. The Shanghai Garrison Command had already learned of this intelligence, and I was summoned to Shanghai to attend a joint meeting.</p>
<p>A Daughter Studying in Middle School</p>
<p>Wang Ba Mei is now a County Councilor in Ping Hu County. Her actual surname is Huang, and she was once named Bai Mei, and now she is named Bai Qi. She has a daughter who is sixteen years old and studying at Ping Hu Middle School. It is said that she also has an extraordinary female bodyguard who can swim while carrying her on her back and can shoot with two guns simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Ruifang and An E, Ms. Huang is also quite humorous. She has a pair of black leather shoes with flat heels and a somewhat platform sole. In her room, there are also scented soaps and snow creams. Her residence also has a Buddhist hall and is a clean and bright house leaning against the mountains and facing the sea.</p>
<p>No Education, Only Knows How to Shoot</p>
<p>She often humbly says: "I have no education and only know how to shoot." However, all the experiences in her life journey are knowledge that cannot be learned from books.</p>
<p>Now, she has left Hangzhou and returned to Zha Pu, which makes me think of this important town on the coast, where the dilapidated forts of the late Qing Dynasty remain. It is a strategic military location and the eastern major port planned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We hope that there will be more enthusiastic and chivalrous people like Ms. Huang Bai Qi to make Zha Pu prosperous and strong!</p>

<h3>Golden Macau</h3>
<p>The existence of a gold market here has created one of the largest economic loopholes in the country today. Most people only know about Hong Kong and ignore Macau, which has led to Macau's abnormal development.</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch on the 4th] On the land of China, there is a place where many people carry ten taels of gold each day with the official permission of customs, and they keep running into the country. The distinction between domestic and foreign is only a "customs gate". Once you exit the "Customs Gate" and pass through customs (Gongbei Customs), you are inside the country. Once you find a place in the country to put down the ten taels of gold, you can turn around and run back abroad, and then bring another ten taels of gold into the country legitimately. Even if the customs officers are familiar with your face, they will not confiscate your gold or put you in detention. In this place, it is not illegal to bring ten taels of gold into the country from abroad each time. Therefore, you only have to worry about your capital not being enough, and you don't have to worry about not making a fortune. This is the gold supply for Guangzhou, Hankou, and even Shanghai. This is the only normal way for people to bring gold into the country besides the official government channels. It can also be said that it is a...</p>
<p>convenient gate in the current domestic financial market. This place is Macau, the southernmost part of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, separated from Hong Kong by forty miles of sea.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai and Hong Kong successively banned the import and export of gold, Macau has suddenly become a gold market in the Far East today. Mexican gold and American gold are continuously shipped by air from Manila to Macau and then transported into the country. According to conservative estimates from customs officials, at least an average of one thousand taels of gold are shipped from Macau to the mainland every day, not counting large-scale smuggling. Currently, many merchants buy gold in Macau, transport it to Hankou, and then buy products from Central China and transport them back via the Yuehan Railway. It is said that the profits are quite considerable. The Macau gold market uses the old scale, while Hankou uses the new scale. Every ten taels of gold gains two additional taels, which becomes their guaranteed profit.</p>
<p>According to investigations by the economic sector, there are at least two Chinese-owned banks in Hong Kong and Macau that have huge amounts of US dollars deposited in the United States for the purpose of importing gold. They ship gold from the United States to Macau and then immediately use various methods in Hong Kong to purchase an equivalent value of</p>
<p>US dollar foreign exchange to replenish their deposits in New York. Macau's gold imports are endless, while the US dollar foreign exchange in Hong Kong (mostly from returning overseas Chinese, tourist checks, American military personnel in Hong Kong, and wealthy individuals from Shanghai) is limited. As a result, the black market exchange rate for US dollars in Hong Kong is rising daily, and the price of gold is also increasing accordingly. Due to the existence of the gold market, Macau has now become one of the largest economic loopholes in the country today. Most people only knew about Hong Kong and ignored Macau, which led to the abnormal development of Macau. Recently, after Ding Guitang, Deputy Director-General of Customs, visited Macau, Rogers, Financial Advisor to the Central Bank, and Yu Yingjie, a representative of the Central Bank, rushed from Shanghai to Macau to discuss a Sino-Macau agreement similar to the Sino-Hong Kong agreement with the Macau authorities. Nourished by</p>
<p>gold, Macau has gradually recovered from its post-war decline. The Macau government is increasing the business tax on the gold market and collecting a deposit of five million yuan, while issuing new Macanese patacas to withdraw old patacas. As a result, credit is tight. Coinciding with the rise of the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar in Macau recently only had a value of seven corners and nine fen in Macanese patacas (usually almost at par). Hong Kong merchants "raised" Macau, but were bitten back by Macau, and it was too late to cry out in pain! The Macau government's budget for this year, announced on February 20, totals 11,162,605 yuan, an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year's 8,709,018 yuan, which can be interpreted as Macau Governor Albino Rodrigues Coutinho's statement that "Macau's society and commercial prosperity have already undergone a major turnaround."</p>
<p>The existence of the gold market has propelled Macau into a new stage. The reporter would like to add a sentence at the end of this short article: I hope that the people of the country will not only know about Hong Kong and forget about Macau! (Special Correspondent Zi Jian)</p>
<h3>Strange Incident of Conscription in Hangzhou: Wife Sells Husband</h3>
<p>For a Price of 12 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 5th] A strange incident of a wife selling her husband recently occurred in Hangzhou, causing a sensation far and wide. The man who was sold, named Ma Jisheng, is a rickshaw puller, 40 years old, originally from Shaoxing, and lives at No. 5, Lane 2, Fuhai Li, Gongchen Bridge. He married a woman named Gao Ma, who was a twice-remarried widow, very ugly and promiscuous. She had an affair with Wang Lianqing, a small worker at the nearby Sanba Soy Sauce Factory. Later, she had an affair with a carpenter nicknamed "Zizi" at Nanxing Bridge and cohabited with him. Ma was lazy by nature, and as long as he had old wine in hand, he didn't care about anything else. On the tenth day of the Lunar New Year, Gao suddenly invited Ma to drink at the house of Shi Jianfei in Nanxing Bridge. Ma went with his neighbor, Li Amao, but then disappeared. Later, through the diligent efforts of Li's mother and younger brother, Kun Sheng, it was learned that Ma had been sold by Gao in collusion with her lover, Wang Qing, to Shi Jianfei to serve as a conscript for a price of 12 million national currency. Gao received 9 million, and Shi received 3 million. Li then reported this to the Criminal Police Team, who arrested Gao, Shi, and others. They are currently under strict interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Town Head in Wu County Bribes to Release Conscripts; Removed from Office and Investigated</h3>
<p>[Our Wu County Dispatch on the 5th] Cao Ziheng, the town head of Jinzhe in the urban area, abused his power during the first term of emergency conscription in 1948 by accepting bribes ranging from 30 to 50 million per person to release conscripts. He was recently reported to the Wu County Regiment Management District Command. The military law office of the command arrested him. After investigation, the allegations were found to be true. He was temporarily released on bail with the guarantee of three reliable shops and 2,000 yuan in cash. The entire case has been transferred to the Wu District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law. The county government has ordered his removal from office.</p>
<h3>Journey to Shanxi (II): Integration of Soldiers and Farmers</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch on the 2nd] In the conference room of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the screen door was inscribed with: "Treat people with tolerance and you will win them over; handle affairs with moderation and you will succeed." There was also a couplet: "Moderation is the ultimate principle of governance; to attain moderation is to survive, to lose moderation is to perish." Therefore, it is probably correct to say that General Yan's approach to dealing with matters in Shanxi today is based on "moderation" as the starting point for his thoughts and theories. At the same time, the Communist bandits today are rampant because they take advantage of two gaps: the political flaws of the government's actions that cannot fully satisfy the people's needs, and the economic loopholes of the excessive disparity between the rich and the poor. This objective environment is enough to make him find a way out from the word "moderation." General Yan simply explained: "Now the country needs soldiers, and the people need to live. If we can find a moderate solution, we can take care of both sides." Therefore, the "integration of soldiers and farmers" proposed during the War of Resistance in Western Jin is even more active today.</p>
<p>The New Era Well-Field System</p>
<p>The "integration of soldiers and farmers" is, in fact, the "well-field system" of the new era. It breaks the contradiction between "land concentration" and "land use dispersion" and thoroughly saves the rural areas that have been on the verge of bankruptcy for centuries. At the same time, it also provides an absolute guarantee for the conscription system.</p>
<p>The most important content of the "integration of soldiers and farmers" is the division of land. Unlike the Communist bandits' brutal killing of landlords and confiscation of land, or issuing public bonds to buy land, it simply stipulates that each field should pay one tael of silver grain and one dan of rent (one tael of silver grain is equivalent to about eight to twelve mu of land, re-averaged according to yield into seven grades and thirty-one levels). The landlord retains ownership, the farmers obtain the right to use the land, and the government manages the distribution rights. In the past, farmers paid rent to landlords, amounting to as much as seven dou to one dan and one dou per mu. Although the current one tael of silver grain and one dan of rent can still be considered a form of exploitation, and it cannot achieve the goal of "land to the tiller" as advocated by the Founding Father of the Republic, but only land for the tiller to "cultivate," this partial realization of "equal land rights" is, despite its imperfections, seemingly quite valuable, given that it is not completely adapted to the local environment.</p>
<p>Standards and Organization of Land Distribution</p>
<p>The standard of land allocation is that the number of mu that two farm laborers can cultivate is considered a small portion, and it is allocated to one soldier and one farmer (regular soldiers, reservists, national soldiers), who cultivate it jointly with their families. If the family labor force is insufficient, supplementary labor will be arranged to assist. The principle is that the income of one farm laborer should be able to support four people. In order to facilitate the arrival of collective mechanized cultivation in the future, six small portions of land are combined into one large portion when dividing the land. On this basis, it will be possible to consolidate labor in the future for industrial production and construction. The second is the organization of preferential treatment. Six males aged 18 to 47 voluntarily form a group. Each person receives a small portion of land, one person serves in the regular army for three years on rotation; one person serves as a reservist and goes to war in case of conflict; and four people serve as national soldiers. Two national soldiers provide preferential treatment to one regular soldier, and two national soldiers provide preferential treatment to one reservist. That is, after the regular soldiers and reservists enter the military, the people can choose how to handle the land allocation: (1) Assistance Method - help with labor, (2) Withdrawal Method - distribute grain, (3) Contribution Method - provide grain and take responsibility for planting, (4) Conversion Method - convert grain into labor. In this way, each regular soldier and reservist can receive at least six dan of grain (rice, wheat) and twelve jin of cotton.</p>
<p>The landlords receive one dan of rent for one tael of silver grain, which, strictly speaking, is still "unearned income." Therefore, they have to pay 20% of the progressive relief grain to provide relief to the old, weak, and helpless. In addition, compulsory national education and democratic politics for national soldiers can be started from scratch.</p>
<p>Slogan: Nine Goods and Four Nots</p>
<p>The land in the "integration of soldiers and farmers" is permanent. "Those who have permanent property have a stable mind." Everyone cultivates the land well. Each organized group must help and protect each other, assist with labor and grain, and ensure that they do not communicate with bandits or flee. The details are specified in even greater detail. General Guan often boasts about this: "There are now more people farming and more people serving in the military in Shanxi Province." Therefore, he shouted the slogans "Nine Goods" and "Four Nots." The "Nine Goods" are: (1) Soldiers receive preferential treatment. (2) Farmers have enough land to cultivate, and the results of their labor are privately owned. (3) Burdens are fairly distributed. (4) The old and weak receive relief. (5) Educational opportunities are equal. (6) Right and wrong are treated equally. (7) Living standards are equal. (8) National soldiers have stable occupations. (9) Regular soldiers have permanent property." The "Four Nots" are: "No poor people, no idle people, no bad people, no foolish people?" Currently, the cultivated area in the 19 cities and counties in the Jinzhong District is approximately 8.4 million mu. Except for the mountainous areas close to the bandit areas, 202,892 portions have already been allocated, and it is estimated that 40,000 more portions will be added this year.</p>
<p>Experiment Zone for Integrating Soldiers and Farmers</p>
<p>The press corps visited the local "Experiment Zone for Integrating Soldiers and Farmers" in Jinci, southwest of Taiyuan. This historical site, where King Cheng of Zhou enfeoffed his brother, the Tang Huai and Zhou Bai trees, ancient and vigorous, evoke nostalgia for the past. The Nanlao Spring, crystal clear, is a welcome comfort in this vast plain where yellow sand rolls all day long.</p>
<p>The People's Defense Army was training intensely on the parade ground. We separately entered this small town and sought in-depth inquiries from the people. Most of the extremely poor people and tenant farmers are now smiling because their lives have a permanent footing. They said that in the past, they had to kowtow to the landlords every year, begging for a living. They had no clothes to wear, no surplus grain, and could not even find a wife. Today, everyone is well-matched. Some landlords clearly had forced smiles on their faces. For the sake of the masses, they had to sacrifice their own interests. Did you not see the pavilions and towers in the Jinci villas of the former Taiyuan Garrison Commander and Artillery Commander? Now, only broken bricks and collapsed walls remain, and thousands of mu of fertile fields have become land shares, taken from the people and returned to the people today!

<p>Bandit Troops He Tingyun et al. Jointly Expose Traitorous Schemes</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch on the 6th] The treacherous bandits bewilder and coerce young people in the National Army, engaging in assassinations and poisoning, sparing no effort. Yan personally trained more than 3,000 troops. After three grievance meetings, three heated struggles, and two self-confession discussions, He Tingyun et al. recently made a joint declaration, exposing the traitorous schemes, using repentance and guilt to obtain new recruits.</p>

<h3>Qingpu Grain Office Staff Member Zhang Ping Escapes but is Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Our Qingpu Dispatch on the 5th] Zhang Ping, a custodian at the Fangjia Yao collection warehouse of the Grain Office, was found to have engaged in illegal surcharges and malfeasance by the authorities. He was detained at the Security Brigade headquarters in late December of last year. While the investigation was ongoing and transfer to judicial authorities was being planned, Zhang suddenly took advantage of an opportunity to escape on Lunar New Year's Eve. Security Brigade Captain Wang Jialiang secretly instructed officers to investigate. They learned that Zhang was hiding at the Jinshan Hotel on Second Ma Road in Shanghai. On the 3rd, they dispatched personnel to Shanghai to arrest him and bring him back to the county for trial.</p>
<h3>Guard County Uncovers a Case of Selling Conscripts; Two Key Suspects Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Salt Sales Stagnant; Seeking to Exchange for Jiangxi Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 6th] Since the increase in salt tax, the cost of Zhejiang salt has greatly increased, leading to stagnant sales. Current storage has reached more than 2 million dan, freezing a large amount of capital. The Salt Management Bureau and the salt merchants are both panicked.

<h3>Greening Hangzhou: Work Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 5th] Renovating scenic spots in spring is an annual routine for the municipal government. The railings and walls of the Lakeside Park, Pinghu Qiuyue, Zhongshan Park, and other places have begun to be repainted, and "greening" work is also proceeding smoothly. In addition to 1.3 to 1.4 million seedlings prepared by the city itself, the Agricultural Improvement Institute has also agreed to allocate 180,000 seedlings. The provincial government has also agreed to allocate half of the funding.</p>
<p>"Relying on one spring for three winters" is the slogan of the people of Hangzhou. Therefore, spring also makes Hangzhou a valuable place. For example, the Songmu Courtyard is a place where incense boats gather, and the rental fee for a stall selling snacks is as high as several dan of grain.</p>
<p>The spring water is rising. The water level of the Qiantang River's shallowest section, Qibao, has also risen to two meters. Ships of 500 tons can navigate without obstruction. According to Deputy Director Wang of the Dyke Construction Bureau, this ideal water level can be maintained until this winter, which means that navigation on the Qiantang River has reached a mature stage this year.</p>
<p>The city's winter relief work is scheduled to end at the end of this month. It is reported that the issuance of funds to poor households and the disbursement of resettlement fees for more than 200 refugees in shelters have been completely abandoned due to financial difficulties.

<h3>Xiangcheng Liji Plans to Build a Port</h3>
<p>Wang Dongyuan Personally Goes to Inspect</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Changsha 5th Dispatch] Chairman Wang Dongyuan, together with Lin Shibo, Li Rongcan, and others, took a special train to Chenglingji for inspection on the afternoon of the 2nd. They arrived at 8:00 AM on the 3rd and stayed for four hours, inspecting various locations prepared for construction, such as Lianhua Pond and Lao Jikou. They returned to Changsha at 9:00 PM.

Currently, the entire project is still in the surveying phase. Formal construction can begin upon completion of the surveying. According to port construction engineer Li Rongmeng, the trip resulted in the following new feasible plans: Downstream of Chenglingji, the northeast of Lianhua Pond, facing Jiangzhou, can accommodate deep-water vessels of 2,000 to 5,000 tons. Two hundred meters from the shore south of Lianhua Pond at Lao Jikou, the water depth reaches six meters, making it an excellent location for building a wharf. Further south, near Guihua Garden, it can be used as a wave shelter and for ship repairs. The section south of Liugong Temple to the customs house has calm winds and waves, making it a good anchorage for ships. Following this inspection, it is planned to proceed actively, first establishing a preparatory office to begin surveying work.

<h3>Peking Research Institute Plans to Build an Atomic Building, High Costs Make it Difficult to Realize Temporarily</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] After the Radium Research Institute of the National Peking Research Institute was ordered to be renamed the Atomic Research Institute, it was planned to build an atomic building behind the Institute of Physics and Chemistry building of the institute on the gate of the Peking Royal City as the usage of the "Physics" and "Atomic" Research Institutes. At present, due to the huge cost required, this academic plan is difficult to realize in the short term. According to Lu Xueshan, the acting director of the institute, he has not yet been informed how the institute's major plan is proceeding; however, he believes that the importance of scientific research is valued by all informed people today, and even if this major plan cannot be realized in the short term due to lack of funding, it will inevitably be realized one day in the course of scientific research in our country and for the needs of national defense. Speaking of the current national economic situation, he believes that if the government cannot use huge amounts of funds to increase new equipment for scientific research, it can cooperate with research institutions and organizations that have already achieved results, which can also achieve some effects. This kind of cooperation has been done in the past and present, but the degree of cooperation still needs to be strengthened. In other words, the supplementary funds required for cooperation by various research institutions and organizations must have a necessary increase.</p>

<h3>City Councilors Suggest that the Central National School in the Old Zhabei District Be Reorganized from Gezhi Middle School</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] City Councilors Yan E'sheng, Zhang Yiqu, Jiang Pingfan, Hou Jiyuan, Fang Rusheng, Tao Guangchuan, Yu Chuanding, Gu Zhuxuan, Jiang Hao, Yu Shun, Zhu Wende, Zhang Zhongyuan, Yi Xia, Huang Zenshi, Chen Weijian, Li Kaidi, Chen Deyi, Zhou Chengxiang, Xu Xueyu, Gao Shuan, Chen Peide, Wang Weiyin, Cen Zhiliang, Zhan Wenhu, Zhou Feicheng, Zhang Xuelian, Tong Xingbai, Zhang, Dong Rengui, Chen Baotai, Zhuang Ping, Chen Jieru, Tian Shujun, Shi Zongde, Zhu Liangcai, Mao Jia, Zhang Zhihan, Ji Hao, Guo Linshuang, Chen Gaoyong, He Chengfu, Ma Junshuo, and other forty-two people suggested to this session of the City Council that the original municipal Gezhi Middle School be reorganized into the Central National School of the Old Zhabei District and the original municipal library be reorganized into the National School of the Old Zhabei District to meet the urgent needs of national education. The reasons are as follows: "National education should be based on the principle of universal development. At present, there are many school-age children in the Old Zhabei District, but there is no municipal national school, which is quite unbalanced. The fourth session of this council resolved that at least five national schools should be established in the Old Zhabei District as soon as possible. However, the Education Bureau has made excuses for lacking public land and has delayed implementation, which is unsatisfactory. At this time of school shortage, we should weigh the priorities and plan comprehensively. In terms of importance, secondary schools seem to be slightly slower than primary schools. The original municipal Gezhi Middle School in the Old Zhabei District should be reorganized into the Central National School of the Old Zhabei District. Also, the municipal library, which is related to international observation, should not be located above a small vegetable market. The original municipal library above the Fuzhou Road small vegetable market should be reorganized into the National School of the Old Zhabei District." It is also proposed that the methods are as follows: (1) The municipal Gezhi Middle School should be reorganized into the Central National School of the Old Zhabei District. The original Gezhi Middle School should find another location for construction. The construction costs should be allocated by the municipal government from the municipal education funds by five-tenths, the Old Zhabei District should raise one-tenth, and four-tenths should be allocated after the sale of the Hardoon Charity Fund's real estate. (2) The municipal library should be reorganized into the National School of the Old Zhabei District. The original library should find another location, which should be handled by the municipal government in a unified manner. The City Council plenary session resolved yesterday to submit it to the Education Committee for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University's New Moral Education Policy: Cultivate Students' Sense of Shame, Disciplinary Actions Will Not Be Announced</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Jiaotong University has recently formulated a new moral education policy, stipulating that in the future, students who violate school rules and should be punished will not be announced. The school will send a notification to parents and guarantors separately, and a copy will be handed to the punished student in person by the counselor, who will give earnest guidance. If the matter concerns the entire student body and should be announced for warning purposes, only the facts will be announced, without specifying names, to cultivate students' sense of shame and guide the school spirit to become more pure. The school explained the meaning of this new moral education policy as follows: "It is necessary to cultivate character as the first priority during the period of students' schooling, and the most important thing to cultivate character is to know shame. Those who are above average are ashamed of not being sages and sages, those who are average are also ashamed of their achievements not being as good as others, and those who are below average will conceal their improper behavior as much as possible, fearing that others will know. All of this is the good knowledge of knowing shame. Although there is an obvious difference between the wise and the foolish, they are the same in knowing shame. Schools train students, stimulating those who do not know shame, and cultivating those who know shame. There is no way to achieve the purpose of education by cultivating the habit of shamelessness. In the old customs of the former Qing Dynasty, a tiger-head tablet was hung in the school courtyard, with military sticks hanging below. Whenever a student violated the rules, the punishment and facts would be written on the tiger-head tablet and announced to the public. The situation was generally handled according to the established regulations of the court's public judgment. The students who violated the rules were like criminals. This is really contrary to the purpose of cultivating a sense of shame, and especially contrary to the great teaching of concealing evil and promoting good. The old habits of national subjugation are not to be blamed. In recent years, it has been changed to an announcement. Although it is slightly different from the form of sentencing, it is not enough to cultivate the habit of knowing shame, so there is no great difference in the first place. Young students, with unstable blood and energy, occasionally have faults and violate school rules. Although they have to be punished, they also hope that they will reform and do good. Why should we point out their faults in a place where everyone can see, so that they are criticized everywhere and have nowhere to hide, and even cut off their path to self-renewal. What is the difference between such guidance and going south by driving the chariot north? Moreover, foreign universities never have public punishments. Why should we follow the old habits of the former Qing Dynasty, abandon the models of the advanced, and forget the ancient teachings of our country?"</p>
<h3>Director Li Gave Instructions on This Semester's Guidance Work</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Deputy Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau summoned all supervisors to the bureau at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss the guidance work for this semester and gave the following instructions: (1) This semester, many private schools have applied to increase tuition fees by 20% according to the prescribed fee standards. Each supervisor should strictly investigate the use of fees by each school to see if it is used for the construction of educational facilities. Regarding poor students, if all schools in the city can truly achieve the 25% free quota, then there will not be so many out-of-school school-age children in the city. To prevent principals from being opportunistic, each supervisor should strictly investigate whether the fees waived by each school account for one-quarter of the total number of students, not just whether the number of students accounts for one-quarter. (2) Physical education, labor-aesthetics, music, Boy Scouts, physics and chemistry, and other specialized inspections should use their strengths to reduce the workload of case investigation and focus on guidance work, which will be more effective. (3) Although the organization of student parent-teacher associations in each school has many difficulties, parents with the ability should be strongly urged to complete the organization. (4) For greening education, the Education Bureau has already allocated tree seedlings. Each supervisor should especially urge each school to plant trees on Arbor Day. Deputy Director Li also specifically pointed out that the main responsibility of supervisors is not only to pay attention to the expenditure of education funds and strive for their proper use, and to supervise school facilities and strive for their properness. Supervisors are actually friends and consultants of teachers and should jointly strive for the progress of education in a research-oriented manner. In particular, rural supervisors can stay in the countryside for a day or two to understand the school environment and know how to improve and guide it.</p>

In addition, the school's music department will hold a grand concert soon, and the Shanghai University Orchestra and Sacred Music Choir have begun practicing. In late March, the school's English Drama Society also plans to publicly perform the famous English drama "Gong Baochuan" at the Lyceum Theatre, with President Ling and others personally participating in the direction and recruiting actors on campus. At the same time, the organization of the teams has also begun actively. In addition to the competitions between the various levels of fellowships, the teacher-faculty team organized by the faculty and staff challenged the senior year basketball team, the champion of the previous year. That day, President Ling, in the posture of the captain of the East China Eight Universities Basketball Championship team, put on his uniform and went into battle bravely, but lost by only a few points.</p>
<p>A Winding Path Around the Campus, Over 6,000 Feet Long</p>
<p>In terms of psychological construction, Shanghai University has indeed achieved great success, but it is still working hard to expand in terms of material things to achieve the realm of truth, goodness, and beauty. The new concrete tennis court will be completed soon, and the funds for the new female dormitory have been donated by foreign churches.

<p>Repair of the National Games Venue to Be Completed in Mid-Next Month, Hao Gengsheng Invites Reporters for a Visit and Reports on the Repair Work Plan</p>
<p>The 7th National Games are scheduled to be held in Shanghai on May 5th. Currently, the Municipal Sports Ground is under repair and is expected to be fully completed by April 20th. At 3:00 PM on the 6th, Hao Gengsheng, Secretary-General of the National Games Preparatory Committee, specially invited reporters to visit Jiangwan. The Municipal Sports Ground is divided into five sections: track and field, volleyball and tennis courts, a swimming pool, a basketball hall, and a recreation room. The track and field area is ready for paving, and the main task is the repair of the grandstands. The oval reinforced concrete grandstand on the south side has been completely demolished and rebuilt into a horseshoe shape, while the other three sides are being renovated. The renovation cost is approximately 20 billion yuan. The volleyball and tennis courts are also under construction. The swimming pool equipment suffered minor damage, and about 10,000 square tiles in the pool need to be replaced, currently priced at 120,000 yuan per square meter. A philanthropist has generously agreed to donate the entire amount. The basketball hall is relatively intact, but the floor is missing. The current plan is to lay foreign pine in the center of the hall and domestic pine planks on the sides. All materials have been purchased and are ready for installation. The recreation room has not been damaged and only needs to be painted. Regarding the units participating in the National Games, according to Hao Gengsheng, the Preparatory Committee has issued 60 invitations, and it is estimated that approximately 3,000 athletes from various provinces and cities will come to Shanghai to participate. The northwestern provinces will also send equestrian teams to participate in the performances. As for the accommodation and food issues, the Preparatory Committee has found many large houses nearby, and each unit will be responsible for its own meals. However, the committee has arranged for chefs from various regions to cater to the tastes of athletes from different places. The sports ground will begin preparations after the construction is completed. The National Games will last for eleven days and are expected to close on schedule. Hao Gengsheng returned to Beijing by car on the 3rd evening and is scheduled to come to Shanghai again next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Enkas Avenges Old Grievances, Dagong Team Suffers Defeat in Hard Battle, Green Forest Wins Division B2-A Championship</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Division A basketball league, the powerful Enkas team from Xiqing defeated Dagong last night, 56-45, avenging their defeat in the first round. The score was 23-29 in the first half, with Dagong trailing by six points. Green Forest won the championship with a score of 57-32.</p>
<p>The previous night's victory of the United Nations team over the US Navy's Marines inevitably exhausted Dagong's main players, so they could not muster their energy in yesterday's battle. Their offensive play under the basket was also far inferior to Enkas. Although their individual skills were not weak, their cooperation was not satisfactory, and they fought individually. In contrast, Enkas pressed forward step by step, attacking and defending fiercely, which forced Dagong to admit defeat.</p>
<p>The Dagong-Enkas battle began at 7:30 PM after the first match. In the center jump, Cai Wenhua had excellent spring, and Ge Pengqiguofu was ashamed to be inferior. Bao Lai scored first, and after Tu Wenlong's efforts, the score was tied at 5-5. Zhong Qiang chased out and tied the score at 7-7. Wenzhang replaced Boling, and he and Wenhua launched a joint attack, 11-9. After the score was tied at 13-13, the situation began to change. Enkas increased their score to 20, and their offensive was formidable. Dagong repeatedly changed their lineup, but it was not very effective, and their luck was also poor. Fortunately, the long shots of Hua and Long embellished the game. In the first half, the score was 23-29, with Dagong trailing by six points. In the second half, Wenlong and Wenhua still supported the situation, but they were caught off guard and the opponent strode forward, with the score at 33-43, a difference of ten points. From then on, the victory or defeat was decided, and the overall situation was settled. Although Dagong fought a desperate battle, they could not stop the attack and finally lost to Enkas with a score of 45-56.</p>
<p>In the first match between Lulin and Tisheng, Le Jiazhou scored two points for Lulin, and Lin Shaohua made a free throw, leading 3-0. Tisheng's Tang Mingxin broke through the basket with one hand, intending to develop his game, but Lulin's Zheng Sen, Cunzhong Jiazhou, and Yunshan made repeated free throws, and Tisheng could not resist. In the first half, Lulin took the lead with a score of 30-16. In the second half, the lineups of both sides were changed, but the game was still controlled by Lulin. At the end of the time, Lulin easily defeated Tisheng with a score of 57-32, winning the championship of the group.</p>

<p>Two acts of the Division A-1 basketball league will be held tonight at the Municipal Gymnasium. Admission tickets are 30,000 upstairs and 60,000 downstairs. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>The Surge in Rice Prices Spreads in the North and South Markets, Japonica and Indica Both Reach New High Prices, Sales Increase on Weekends, and Prices in Major Production Areas Rise Sharply Again</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice market rose sharply yesterday, and sales were brisk. High-quality japonica rice reached a new high price of 3.4 million yuan. All goods rose by 250,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. It is reported that the reasons for the rise were: (1) The production area reported an increase of more than 200,000 yuan. (2) The shops were quite eager to stock up. (3) Credit was unusually loose. Incoming goods were not smooth.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 3,779 dan of goods were registered to arrive in the South Market, and 5,193 dan in the North Market. Market prices: high-quality japonica rice, 3.3 million in the South Market, 3.4 million in the North Market. White japonica rice, 3.27 million in the South Market, 3.32 million in the North Market. Thin indica rice, 3.25 million in the South Market, 3.3 million in the North Market. Early indica rice, 3.1 million in the South Market, 3.2 million in the North Market. Sheep indica rice, 3.17 million in the South Market, 3.33 million in the North Market. Baiyuan rice, 3.25 million in the South Market, 3.34 million in the North Market. Xianyuan rice, 3.1 million in the South Market, 3.05 million in the North Market.</p>
<p>Flour: Prices in Suzhou and Wuxi are both high, and the main holders are determined to hold on. Retail sales are quite eager to stock up. Prices jumped as soon as the market opened due to the psychology of tightness. Bingshen flour opened at 1.42 million, briefly returned to 1.415 million in the middle, and then immediately rose to 1.42 million yuan, 80,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The trading of Lao Che flour was not as active as Bingshen, and the price was 1.44 million, and the after-delivery price was also 1.44 million. Hongfeng Jiancheng initially opened at 1.4 million and closed at 1.305 million yuan. Bran rose sharply, with large packages rising by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Wheat was priced at 2 million, but did not open.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Rose across the board, with prices slightly retreating at the close. Soybeans rose particularly strongly, rising by more than 100,000 early in the day, but sales were average, and the price finally retreated slightly, rising by 100,000. The same was true for corn, which rose by 100,000 early in the day, but Qingdao prices were not high, and the merchant groups were not stocking up much. Therefore, the market retreated later, slightly higher than the previous day by 30,000 yuan. Picked qing beans were actively sold in the local market, rising by 50,000. Tea beans rose by more than 100,000, and red sorghum also rose by 100,000 yuan. Sesame was not stocked by the Tianjin merchants, and the market was stagnant. Raw peanuts were sold in the local market, rising slightly by 100,000, while mid-grade peanuts were average.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: The sentiment was extremely firm and expensive at the beginning of the opening. There were many back-and-forth transactions of soybean oil, and the opening was the firmest. Due to the strong support of the holders, the market opened high. Dayou soybean oil opened at 6.55 million, once calling for 6.6 million, but ultimately the opening price was too high, and the local market was sufficient. Retail investors sold at high prices, and the market softened later. Soybean oil fell to 6.5 million and 6.45 million, still 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil rose from 7.45 million to 7.5 million, 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Raw vegetable sesame oil each rose by more than 200,000, and small car sesame oil followed suit, rising by 300,000. Bean cake rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan under the psychology of tightness.</p>

<p>Song Hanzhang and Others Promote the National Goods Export Movement</p>
<p>Song Hanzhang, Weng Wenhao, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaomei, and others invited people from all walks of life to talk on the 14th floor of the International Hotel at noon yesterday to promote the export of national goods. More than 30 people, including Shen Xirui, Zhao Dihua, Shou Yicheng, Wang Zhixin, Lu Zuofu, Hu Xiyuan, and Wang Xingyao, attended. During the meeting, Mr. Song Hanzhang delivered a speech, stating that the national goods movement has been advocated for many years. In the past, the direction of efforts was biased towards the domestic market. Although considerable achievements have also been made in exports, the ideal has not yet been fully realized. Today, the export of national goods has become an urgent need. People from all walks of life feel that only by working hard to promote the export of national goods can the industry have a way out and move forward. After discussion by the attendees, it was unanimously decided to set up a China National Goods Export Movement Committee, and Song Hanzhang, Weng Wenqian, Xin, Zhi Zhang Xiaomei were elected as the presidium. Cai Chengxin, Wang Xingyao, and Pan Yangyao were appointed as conveners of the preparatory committee. The committee's work outline was also determined as follows: (1) Assist various industries in actively promoting exports, (2) Promote consistent public opinion, (3) Suggest that the government implement effective rewards, (4) Advise factories to pay attention to technological improvements.</p>

<h3>Shàng Hǎi Qū Lǚ Zhī Xiàn É Dì Sì Jì Fēn Pèi Qíng Xíng</h3>
<p>The Allocation Situation of Aluminum Quotas in the Shanghai Area in the Fourth Quarter</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Management Committee, with the exception of a portion set aside for the import of small quantities of aluminum tubes and other raw materials that cannot be produced domestically, the majority of the aluminum quota is used to import aluminum ingots for the manufacture of aluminum sheets and aluminum foil. Therefore, the aluminum ingot quota is divided into two parts: sheet manufacturing and foil manufacturing. Aluminum sheets are the main raw material for the aluminumware industry. In the past, because the industry did not have a public association organization, directly allocating quotas was not comprehensive. Therefore, the aluminum ingot quota for rolling aluminum sheets in the first, second, and third quarters was temporarily allocated to rolling mills (a total of seven rolling mills, including six Chinese-owned and one foreign-owned Hualu Steel Refinement Factory). In the fourth quarter, the Shanghai Aluminumware Industry Association was established and requested direct allocation of manufacturing raw materials. The Management Committee proposed $85,800 USD from the quota to allocate to the factories in the industry. However, it was still stipulated that the rolling mills should apply for import on their behalf and roll them into sheets for use as raw materials to prevent abuses. This measure not only complies with Article 10 of the current import and export trade regulations, which stipulates that the Management Committee may, based on the circumstances, directly allocate quotas to the manufacturers of each industry, but also takes into account the rights and interests of the rolling mills. As for the aluminum ingot quota for foil manufacturing, the import quota allocation department of the Management Committee has thoroughly researched it and handed it over to Hualu Steel Refinement Factory for application and supply. According to the Hualu factory, the average monthly sale of aluminum foil to Chinese cigarette factories is 1,500 boxes, which is sufficient to meet 70% of the industry's needs. According to its production volume, the foreign-owned Yizhong cigarette factory should receive 340 books per month, requiring a total of 81 tons of aluminum ingots. Adding foreign ports and small amounts of other uses, the total monthly amount is approximately 100 tons. The current quota is already not small. In addition, the value of aluminum foil items arriving at the port without a license, which are self-prepared foreign exchange goods, is approximately 2 million USD. The number of applicants for purchase is already not small, and the rest are also applying successively. The Hualu factory also received a fourth-quarter aluminum ingot quota for foil manufacturing of 71,500 USD. Therefore, the current source of aluminum foil is abundant, and there should be no problem with supply.</p>
<h3>Weakness of Chinese Stocks on the Weekend; Bulls Eager to Close Out Positions</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks mostly moved sideways yesterday, but suddenly felt weak near noon. As the closing approached, many bulls felt unable to bear the burden and rushed to sell. Popular stocks ended the day lower, with only Rongfeng Underwear and Sino-French trending upwards. China United Building Material traded ex-rights and closed at the upper limit.</p>
<p>The market opened flat and weak. Wing On Spinning opened at $1,180 and $2,230. China United Cement resumed trading, opening at $220, and was eagerly bought, immediately reaching the upper limit, with demand still exceeding supply. Wing On Spinning rose from $1,137 and $1,128, with transactions immediately delivered by numbers 104, 35, and 141, and progressively delivered by numbers 76, 54, 16, 14, 206, 71, and 226, rising to $1,207 and $1,258. Numbers 36 sold spot deliveries, while numbers 61 and 12 made forward deliveries, and numbers 178, 12, and 228 closed spot deliveries, falling back to $1,177 and $1,225. Numbers 16, 14, 206, 183, 97, and 163 made forward deliveries, while numbers 104 and 218 made spot deliveries. News of the rumored shutdown of spinning and weaving mills boosted confidence, and prices rose again to highs of $1,215 and $1,263. At this point, underwear prices continued to rise, Rongfeng also saw strong profits, and Sino-French neared its upper limit. Numbers 16, 178, 65, 172, 76, 71, 183, 74, 206, 190, 213, and 36 rushed to sell forward deliveries, while numbers 131, 130, and 95 closed spot deliveries. Near noon, a widespread sell-off suddenly occurred, and Sino-French quickly fell back, with Wing On Spinning dropping to lows of $1,163 and $1,203. The noon closing was $1,164 and $1,204.

<h3>Absorption by Out-of-Town Merchants; Cotton Yarn Market Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market had already risen for several consecutive days, seemingly reaching its peak. Out-of-town merchants felt the prices were too high and their interest waned, so the market opened sideways. Later, due to favorable reports of yarn prices in other regions, absorption by both northern and southern merchants strengthened, and local merchants also began to buy, causing the market to immediately become firm.</p>
<p>The final 41 count Super Phoenix fine yarn rose by $100,000 compared to the previous day, to $130 million. Other counts of fine yarn also rose by 500,000 to 1.2 million.</p>
<p>Scattered Selling of Cloth Causes Slight Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially opened with slightly lower asking prices due to tight credit and a soft sentiment. However, those with ample funds immediately bought when they saw selling, and dyeing factories took advantage of the lower prices to absorb inventory, sparking a buying spree and causing the market to immediately become firm.</p>
<p>For 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, absorption by both northern and southern merchants was very strong due to rising exchange rates, and prices soared at one point. Near the close, scattered sellers took profits and sold at higher prices, resulting in a return of 12,000 to 78,000 for each grade of fine cloth compared to the previous day. In addition, serge and straight tribute also fell by 80,000, while printed cloth and 190 Shilin cloth rose by 100,000 to 200,000 due to rising labor and material costs for manufacturers of brands such as Meiting Chick and Yitong. Fine twill and coarse cloth remained stable.</p>
<p>Factory Responsible for Consolidated Tax on Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>[Our report] Yesterday's report stated that the increased consolidated tax on cotton yarn stored in factories would not be borne by the factories. The Yarn Control Committee believes this information is inconsistent with the actual situation and telegraphed the Sixth District Guild to correct it. The Yarn Control Committee's telegram to the Sixth District Guild is recorded below: "To the Sixth District Cotton Textile Machinery Industry Association: Today's report regarding the issue of increased consolidated tax burden on spun cotton yarn without warehouse receipts states that the Association has proposed two suggestions that have been adopted by the Committee for implementation. Upon investigation, Chairman Wang of the Association presented his views to the Committee yesterday. Chairman Yuan of the Committee replied that the case had been resolved by the Fourth Committee Meeting and could not be easily changed. If the Association has other sufficient reasons, it may submit a written request for reconsideration. The discussion yesterday proceeded as described above. The report is inconsistent with the facts and should be corrected by the Association to avoid misunderstandings."</p>
<h3>Customs Limits Confiscation of Goods Arriving at Port to Date of Shipment</h3>
<p>[Our report] On March 5, this newspaper reported that the Municipal Import and Export Commercial Association expressed opposition to the Customs' method of handling goods shipped without permits after October 1, 1947. The Jianghai Customs Department sent a letter explaining the following: "(1) The Import and Export Commercial Association claims that the Customs will confiscate goods shipped before October 1, 1947, but arriving at the port after October 1, 1947, which is inconsistent with the facts. Customs Announcement No. 187 clearly stipulates that the date of shipment is the limit and is not related to the date of arrival at the port.</p>
<p>(2) Customs has no way of knowing the date of shipment of goods arriving at the port unless the merchant submits the relevant bill of lading and invoice together with the customs declaration. Therefore, for goods shipped before October 1, 1947, but arriving at the port after October 1, 1947, if the relevant bill of lading and invoice are not submitted within fifteen days from the date of Customs Announcement No. 187, the Customs will not be able to know the date of shipment and may issue a notice of disposition in accordance with the new method.</p>
<p>(3) After receiving the above notice, if the merchant's goods were indeed shipped before October 1, 1947, they may, in accordance with the provisions of the notice, submit a written statement of objection together with the documents within fifteen days. The Customs will consider this and will not confiscate goods arriving at the port without permits after October 1, 1947, regardless of the date of shipment."</p>
<h3>Payment for Last Year's Tea Cargoes Can Be Cleared Within a Month and a Half</h3>
<p>The Farmer's Bank's pledged tea cargoes from last year that have not been repaid have been specially approved by the United Four Banks for public auction. The Farmer's Bank implemented the first auction on January 21 of this year, but the amount auctioned was not large, only a little over a thousand boxes of Pinglu, Qihong, and green tea. The bank originally planned to hold a second auction, but later, in consideration of the difficulties of tea merchants, the tea could still be redeemed with funds before the second auction was scheduled. The bank believes that this pledged loan has been delayed for too long and should be concluded as soon as possible, so it notified all tea merchants to redeem all of it and complete the procedures by the 15th of this month, otherwise the second auction will be held. Recently, tea prices have improved, and tea merchants have been rushing to the bank to complete the procedures. As of now, less than 4,000 boxes of tea have not been redeemed, and the outstanding loan is only about 3 billion. The tea merchants can repay all of it before the 15th of this month, and last year's tea loan can be concluded within the month.</p>
<h3>Export Industry Provides Suggestions to Improve Industrial Loans</h3>
<p>[Our report] The authorities are currently considering opening up industrial and commercial loans as soon as possible. In view of the past government's handling of export loans, which has not been perfect, the municipal export industry has gathered opinions from the industry to provide to the authorities for reference: (1) Target: Should cover all general commodities. Limiting it to a few commodities such as tung oil, raw silk, tea, bristles, and egg products would be unfair and would lose the meaning of promoting exports. (2) Amount: Previously, each loan was limited to 500 million yuan. If this limit was exceeded, special approval was required. With the current high prices, large amounts of funds are needed. It is proposed that the loan amount be declared by the exporter, based on the amount of foreign exchange that can be exchanged for the exported goods within a specified period (assumed to be three months). The lending national bank and bureau can investigate and approve it. (3) Term: The loan term should vary depending on the exported goods, based on the actual time required for purchase, sorting, packaging, refining, or transportation. The total term should be extended to six months, and packing loans should be extended to three months. (4) Collateral: Export goods need to be processed and sorted after purchase and before export, making it difficult to store them in warehouses. It is recommended to adopt a bank credit guarantee method. If the guaranteeing bank insists on using real estate as collateral, commodity securities or other real estate can be used. (5) Interest rate: Should maintain the original method, not exceeding 3% per month. However, if an exporter uses a low-interest loan for purposes other than export, or if the amount of foreign exchange earned from exports is less than the declared amount, the lending national bank and bureau may cancel the eligibility for the next loan application or impose a fine. (6) Other: In secondary trading ports without branches of national banks and bureaus, exporters should be allowed to choose a favorable location to handle export loan procedures. Exporters should be given convenience in remitting funds when they need to remit funds to purchase goods.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Fluctuate Upwards</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market fluctuated upwards yesterday, eventually rising 8 million more than the upper day. The highest price for 120 Asahi silk in the morning was 62 million, and the lowest was 57 million. The highest price in the afternoon reached 67.5 million, and the final selling price was 5 million. The factory price rose slightly again yesterday, but trading was very quiet on Saturday, with asking prices for all grades rising by 5 million to 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. No 5-dan lots were traded, and only two or three dan of retail lots were traded. The high retail price was 95 million yuan, and the intermediate retail price was around 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk market continued to rise yesterday. Huaqiang True Silk was sold at around 3.4 million yuan at the open, fluctuated for a long time, and rose to 3.8 million yuan at the close, up 1.2 million for Monday. Dacheng Checkered Crepe closed at 311,000 yuan, up 6,000 yuan from the previous day. Lin Ji Wax Feather Yarn was 140,000 yuan, and Minsheng Jingfang Ni was 400,000 yuan. Both local and out-of-town merchants had an appetite for them.</p>
<p>Tea Market Rebounds</p>
<p>The tea market trend remains sharp. However, the market sentiment was somewhat discouraged at the open because it was heard that the Tianjin merchants were only offering around 4 million yuan per dan for Shaoxing fried tea in 1947, and still had an appetite. Fortunately, the market's inventory was almost exhausted, and the market quickly rebounded. Other teas were also favored by buyers, and prices remained firm.</p>
<p>Wood Prices Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's wood market continued to trend upwards due to rumors of the opening of free foreign exchange. Retail sales in various shops were not weak, and the building merchants' interest was moving. Unfortunately, the inventory was insufficient, making the market feel sharper. Foreign pine squares rose to 53,000 yuan per foot, ordinary pieces were 52,000 yuan, and 5-fen pine planks were also up to 900,000 yuan per zhang. 36-foot Lauan plywood was 330,000 yuan per sheet. 3-foot sheets were sold for 380,000 yuan. The price of fir also followed suit, with large strips selling for 11,500 yuan per foot and small strips selling for 11,000 yuan, rising by about 20% compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rubber Overshoes Rise in Price</h3>
<p>The rubber overshoe market has seen repeated adjustments in factory prices due to the rising cost of living and labor expenses for manufacturers. The wholesale market for fellow merchants has also risen sharply. In addition, the rainy season sales in both local and out-of-town markets have been activated, and those coming to Shanghai to purchase goods have a strong appetite. Double Coin brand round-mouth men's overshoes are now selling for 1.87 million per dozen, women's Tianzu shoes are 1.45 million, Dai Ping boots are 2.75 million, Huili long boots are 9.6 million, and special sneakers are 4.25 million. Other goods such as Arrow, Drum, Great Happiness, and Great China have also risen by 20% to 30% compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>Teahouse Literature</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>I have been in Shanghai for many years, and I have occasionally visited teahouses and cafes, but I always feel that their flavor is far inferior to the small teahouses in the countryside of the mainland. Perhaps because I am already out of date, I can no longer "catch up" with modern and advanced things. However, the village-style teahouse, compared to the new-style teahouses and cafes in the city, is indeed full of human touch.</p>
<p>In the village teahouse, the relationship between the owner and the tea drinkers is not just a buying and selling relationship. The owner is sometimes a tea drinker. He will sit down and talk to you about business, talk about hard times, and chat idly. You will never be given the cold shoulder by the waiter for sitting there too long. Sometimes the waiter will also answer a sentence or two, making you feel that this place is full of simple human kindness and friendship.</p>
<p>If you are a regular, you don't have to pay cash immediately after drinking the tea. The tea you brewed in the morning can still be drunk in the afternoon. And among the tea drinkers, there are familiar faces everywhere. Although you don't have to greet everyone, if you are happy to greet someone, you will surely find an opponent to talk to you. The village teahouse is really an indispensable social place.</p>
<p>The life of a "teahouse" may be a bit of a waste of life, but the true village teahouse, most of the tea drinkers are barefoot people who steal a little leisure from their busy lives. Except for a few gentry gentlemen or shop owners in the town, there are not many people who hatch in the teahouse all day long. During the busy farming season, it is rare to see one or two idlers. This is quite different from the situation in urban teahouses and cafes, where there is constant coming and going all day long.</p>
<p>I have occasionally seen people criticize the current cultural world for only having pornographic literature and "teahouse literature." I know about pornographic literature, but I was quite at a loss at first as to what teahouse literature refers to. Then I thought, it probably refers to a generation of articles that specialize in writing about leisure and trivial matters around them. Because this kind of thing, in the eyes of those who are ideologically progressive, is like the village teahouse, completely a waste, so it is called teahouse literature.</p>
<p>If I guessed correctly, I would like to say a few words for teahouse literature.</p>
<p>I think the name teahouse literature is not bad, at least not worse than the urban "tea room literature" or "coffee literature" of the new romantic school. Because although teahouse literature doesn't pay much attention to "serious spirit," it is ultimately a manifestation of human emotion. This is just like the barefoot people in the village teahouse talking about everything. Although it is inevitably vulgar, it is ultimately a genuine expression of emotion. And as far as I know, sincere emotion is one of the basic conditions of all literature and art.</p>
<p>For example, now a generation of poets are shouting that they should "learn from" a certain poet. Why should they "learn from" this poet? It is simply because the "mountain songs" sung by this poet can draw more material from folk ballads. In other words, it is because this kind of poetry has some human touch. Even illiterate villagers can understand a few sentences. In fact, this kind of poetry should also belong to teahouse literature.</p>
<p>If teahouse literature only refers to things like idle talk and gossip, I don't think there is anything wrong with it. Because this kind of article may not make a big contribution to the world and people's hearts, but it is ultimately harmless to people's hearts. Language and writing are nothing more than tools for people to express their own perceptions. Some people like to write with morals and express their ambitions with poetry, and write many meaningful works, which is naturally worthy of admiration. But because I like this kind of article, I classify others' as just teahouse literature, then I am inevitably too narrow-minded.</p>
<p>We have heard a lot about the voice of public opinion, but if we were to say that there is any real public opinion institution in the Chinese countryside, I am afraid we should recommend the small teahouses in remote mountain villages. Although the villagers' wild talk in the small teahouse cannot be fully believed, they are ultimately words between people. They are rough, but they are full of true feelings, and sometimes they do not lack true insights.</p>
<p>Teahouse literature is also like this. Although the people who write this kind of thing do not have a ready-made theory as a model, as long as they write what they want to say, no one can object to them. In the past, someone advocated miscellaneous essays, isn't that what it meant? If miscellaneous essays can only be of one kind, then what is there to "miscellaneous" about?</p>
<h3>On Relationships</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>Nowadays (in fact, it has been the same in ancient times), everything is inseparable from all kinds of relationships. Scholars who study literature are either called political relationships, economic relationships, or social relationships, historical relationships. Many people who pay attention to practical benefits pay more attention to interpersonal relationships, hometown relationships... and so on, such as cronyism, which are regarded as a stepping stone to advancement. Some experts in the United States have even written books such as "Customer Relationships" and "International Trade Relations," which are magnificent and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of what we have seen and heard in the world, we occasionally go to a company to visit a friend, and find that the person in charge is a handsome young man, while the old and prudent people are instead driven by him. After inquiring again, we find that this gentleman is the son of a wealthy merchant, and we are speechless.</p>
<p>Let's take the Hull Memoirs published in this newspaper as an example. A few days ago, it was writing about the tense moments before and after the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor war. With Hull's rich experience and deep experience, he was the only one who could not participate in President Roosevelt's military meetings. On the contrary, Roosevelt Jr.'s official position was far below Hull, but he could always be by his side. All the historical materials that Hull could not collect or see were easily obtained by Roosevelt Jr. There is no other reason, but that President Roosevelt is his father.</p>
<p>When we see people who are good at using relationships in the world, they are successful in everything. In small things, such as buying things, they can get discounts, and they can get distribution goods or pay fees without queuing... In big things, such as getting rich and getting promoted, they are all in it. According to various European and American countries, which are known to the world for their high work efficiency, their "obtaining the greatest harvest with the least effort" can only be said to those who are "good at using relationships" in our country.</p>
<p>A certain Hollywood playwright once created the character of Samuel in his writing, which is a typical example of this kind of person. Samuel came from a poor background, and used his cunning and wit to make full use of all kinds of opportunities and relationships, from a newspaper boy to a newspaper trainee, and then to the editor of a "radio column." From then on, he sailed smoothly, stealing other people's scripts, and got promoted to a Hollywood director. He waved a thick cigar in one hand, and many strict doors in society were opened by him. Later, he was lucky enough to marry the daughter of a wealthy producer, and the dowry included a luxurious and spacious villa, and he could also obtain the management rights of a large film company. Samuel felt arrogant and invincible, but on his wedding night, he discovered that his wife was having an affair with a certain movie actor. After his desires were satisfied, what followed was disappointment. From the perspective of focusing on relationships, this seems to be a disappointing ending.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Fleeting Marriage (90)</p>
<p>After Qi Wan went to the hospital for bowel cleansing and taking medicine, the gold ring she swallowed was discharged in a few hours. Because she was deeply stimulated, her spirit was very weak, so she stayed in the hospital. Xiao He believed that this unexpected disturbance was related to the reputation of the family, and ordered all the servants that if someone came to visit the boss, just say that she was in the hospital due to illness, and do not tell them which hospital. Although Xiao He wanted to keep it a secret, the people below were quick-tongued. The news spread out in twos and threes. The general tabloids thought it was fresh material and exaggerated it greatly. In less than two days, the whole city was talking about it, and everyone knew about it. Zhu Zhai read the news in the newspaper and rushed to Qi Wan's house to inquire about Wang Ma. Wang Ma believed that Zhu Zhai was different from others, and told him everything about the discussion. Zhu Zhai was very angry when he heard that Director Miao had threatened with a gun, and also felt that Qi Wan's encounter was very pitiful. He rushed to Xishiku Hospital to inquire, but the hospital, at Qi Wan's request, would not receive any guests who came to look for her. Therefore, Zhu Zhai went several times, but could not meet Qi Wan. Zhu Zhai was so anxious that he could only write a letter to inquire, but there was no reply. It turned out that after suffering this stimulation, Qi Wan felt that her face was too ugly, especially that she could not see Zhu Zhai again. Currently, Zhu Zhai did not know the inside story, and she inevitably felt jealous and resentful in her heart. If they met again and knew the reason, it would be even more difficult to deal with, so every day, except for Wang Ma and Xiao Jiu to visit her, talked a few words, and the rest of the time, she stayed alone in the sick room, quietly reading novels to pass the time. Sometimes she walked out of the room, on the corridor, breathing air. Although she felt depressed in her heart, she was unwilling to leave the hospital, because once she went out, seeing her relatives and friends, her face would be too ugly. Qi Wan stayed in the hospital for a week to avoid shame. This day, at dusk, she came out of the room, on the corridor, leaning on the railing, staring blankly at the flower garden in the hospital. She saw two crows calling mournfully on an ancient locust tree. After calling a few times, they flew south together. In this hazy twilight, these few cries of crows were sent to her ears, desolate and moving. Qi Wan stared blankly at the end of the sky. The pair of crows had already flown away without a trace. She felt very sad in her heart, feeling that the tired birds knew to return. Like this pair of flying crows, they still had a home to go to when the day was late and the weather was cold. She herself had been struggling in the art circle since she was a teenager, and she did not know how many storms and changes she had experienced. To this day, she still had no way to go. What she had idealized in the past had become an illusion today, and none of the hopes she had held had been able to be achieved.</p>
<h3>Ling Xiaohan Pavilion's Recent Collection</h3>
<p>— Half-Dream Old Man</p>
<p>Regarding Ling Xiaohan Pavilion, most people know that he is well-versed in both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign texts, but few know that he also possesses a unique discernment for collecting bronze and stone antiques. I remember that this year in the cold stalls of Beiping City, he encountered a descendant of an old family who was offering an ancient inkstone for sale. Upon careful examination, it was indeed the old object of Weng Tanxi, one of the four great calligraphers of the Qing Dynasty. Tanxi's calligraphy is square, upright, meticulous, and strict, capable of incorporating the clerical style into the regular script. In the entire Qing Dynasty, only this old man could directly approach the Jin and Tang styles. The inkstone is about four inches long, one inch thick, and three inches wide, made of green-skinned roof tiles from the Shu Palace. Its color is deep, elegant, and beautiful, possessing the charm of ancient antiquity. On its edge is engraved Tanxi's inkstone inscription, which reads: "Mossy flowers collect emerald, ink traces congeal jasper, a piece of tile from the Shu Palace, may it last ten thousand years." A total of sixteen characters. At the end is signed "Tanxi, the Old Man." Observing its brushstrokes, which are ancient and vigorous, and its rhythm, which is condensed and refined, it is indeed the old man's masterpiece in life. After Ling Xiaohan Pavilion collected it, he sent a rubbing to me on the sea. I wrote a poem on it, saying: "Tanxi the Old Man's Ouyang Xun script, square and sharp, bright as jade, the Shu Palace tile inkstone exhales clouds, wielding the brush freely and naturally; mossy jade ink traces remain from ancient times, deeply carved and lightly engraved, the form is relaxed, the sixteen characters are cherished, a generation of extraordinary writing is sorted out. The old man has long disappeared into the desolate hills, relics are scattered, with no place to store them, who is the possessor Ling Xiao Xu, an inch of field, a foot of house to offer cultivation. The text is majestic, soaring in widespread praise, a paper rubbing remotely sent to me. Deep, elegant and bright, it illuminates my humble dwelling, making my mood directly enter the early Tang Dynasty, placing it on my right side like a jade pendant, a thousand years, ten thousand rituals, the spirit coincides."</p>
<p>He also acquired a Shuoping Prefecture seal in Changdian. Shuoping is located in the northern part of Shanxi Province, leaning against the Great Wall, serving as an important town controlling the border. He sent a rubbing of the seal, which he himself inscribed with a poem: "Two generations of Qi territory, a hundred-mile marquis, ashamed of no seal to continue the former cultivation, a copper talisman in hand is truly a wonderful encounter, obtaining this is no different from governing a prefecture." He added a note: "My ancestor, Mr. Weihou, entered the Jinshi through his name and governed Shandong. My father, Mr. Ziyi, also entered the Shandong officialdom as a Juren. Therefore, it is said that two generations governed Qi Province. I still remember when Mr. Weihou was taking the provincial examination in the Dingwei year of Daoguang, the essay was already completed, but suddenly he heard moaning from the next cubicle. Lifting the curtain to inquire, it turned out to be Li Hongzhang, the Grand Secretary of Hefei, whose essay was only partially completed and was too ill to continue. Mr. Wei asked to see it and determined that it would surely pass, so he helped to complete it and submitted the paper together. That year, both became Jinshi. From then on, their interactions became increasingly close. However, Mr. Wei did not rely on his power, but remained an official who cared for the people. After retiring from office, he served as the head of the Jintai Academy. His family's success in the imperial examinations continued without interruption. Zhi Jing Shirang, and the two historians Yanfu and Yingfu, all enjoyed a good reputation at the time. My friend Jingzhai followed the rhyme and harmonized, saying: "A thousand poems are lighter than ten thousand households of marquises, a hundred cities of books embrace spiritual cultivation, suddenly obtaining a valuable copper talisman, a magnificent hall houses Kyushu." I wrote on his rubbing: "The yellow hall of the five horses, a sixth-rank official, an empty name also fills the scholar's meal, but look at the piled-up copper talismans held, already sighing at the sound of the jade tree's remnants. How can phoenixes truly dwell in thorns, essays must rise from waves. Knowing you possess the responsibility of a prefecture, you don't need the art of Chu and the hat of Gongyu." Obtaining a seal is not unusual, but obtaining a prefectural seal is unusual. Obtaining an official seal as a scholar is even more unusual. What in the world is not a child's play? Official seals were of great importance at the time, but with the passage of time and changes in the world, they are not worth a penny. But then, is being an official not the same? Can the awe-inspiring things that the ancients spoke of last forever?</p>
<p>In addition to obtaining the Shuoping Prefecture seal, he also obtained the Ningjin County School official seal, and also sent a rubbing to me. He also inscribed a poem: "This is the bean curd official of the past, leftover wine and cold food are poor and humble, but now bean curd is as precious as gold, let's seek ancient joy with copper seals." He added a note: "School officials used to be called 'bean curd officials', but now each piece of bean curd costs 10,000 national currency." Taking Shanghai as an example, a large piece of bean curd is already worth more than 20,000 yuan. The rise in prices is truly endless. My friend Jingzhai also followed the original rhyme and harmonized, saying: "The copper seal serves as an old scholar's official, the taste is like trying alfalfa acid, enviable are the scholar's livelihood, the palace wall allows a family's joy." Scholars have no way to make a living. If they could indeed get the salary of a Qing Dynasty school teacher, have a school palace to live in with their families, and have school fields to harvest, what wouldn't they be happy to do? I also wrote a chapter: "A paper official like Zheng Guangwen, wandering in Hebei, already empty of followers, the title of alfalfa can also兼 taste, the mind of artemisia awaits meritorious service; holding the copper bell, boasting of treasure and value, wielding the vermilion ink, moving the wind and clouds, now the Ding and Wu sacrifices are gone, when will the chewing of large meat be satisfied?" School teachers can only feast on sacrificial meat during the grand ceremonies of the Ding and Wu sacrifices.</p>
<p>He also wrote at the end of the two papers: "In the Wuzi year, I traveled to Changdian and obtained a prefectural seal and a Confucian academy copper seal. They were all hidden possessions of treacherous families. After their property was confiscated, their families sold them due to poverty, and after being resold by hawkers, they entered the market and came to me. In the past, old seals sold in Ping City were mostly from the Zuoling of various banners. Local official seals are generally prohibited from being sold, so these two seals were secretly transferred out, which can be said to be unprecedented. Confucian academies were formerly called 'bean curd officials' because they were extremely poor and humble. Apart from the gifts from scholars and the rent from school fields, there was no other income. They couldn't afford meat dishes, and only on the day of the Ding sacrifice could they share the sacrificial meat, which was more than the county magistrate, which could be used for a big feast. Someone once used a couplet to joke about it, saying: 'Sweeping snow, call the boy, don't recognize today's roll call; thundering to invite guests, know that yesterday's sacrifice was Ding.'" The description is vivid and realistic, so it is not abusive. Mr. Aitang, the respected father of Yin Tai from my Yizhou, once served as a school official in Haizhou and also served as the River Supervisor Dao Rong. He obtained the school official position from the Daoguang Jiyou tribute student and rose to the position of Eastern River Governor-General, all of whom had tasted the flavor of alfalfa." Although school officials are poor and humble, they are always sought after by people who "look clean, lofty, deep, and stable." The officialdom is full of storms, but school officials have none. The bitterness lies in this, and the happiness also lies in this.</p>
<h3>No Fear of Wind or Rain</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>When the famous American general O'Donnell was the commander of a joint team in Michigan, there was a good piece of grass in front of his office building. He sent an old sergeant, who had experienced many battles, to be responsible for watering it every day. As soon as the sergeant received the order, he immediately sent a soldier and told him to water it once every afternoon at three o'clock.</p>
<p>One day, there was a heavy thunderstorm. The old sergeant was inspecting the barracks and saw the soldier responsible for watering was sleeping.</p>
<p>The sergeant was furious and said, "It's three o'clock now, why aren't you watering!"</p>
<p>The soldier pleaded, saying, "But, sir, it's raining so hard!"</p>
<p>The sergeant's anger did not diminish. He shouted, "What does it matter if it rains! Don't you have a raincoat?" Jin Lin</p>
<h3>Freedom</h3>
<p>— Jinlin</p>
<p>The freedom of a country is often maintained for thousands of years, but lost in a single morning. — Burke</p>
<p>True freedom is in enjoying one's own rights, not infringing on the rights of others. — Pinkard</p>
<p>Freedom will not be bestowed upon us, we must strive to obtain it; freedom is a kind of enjoyment, but it must be obtained with considerable effort. — Montesquieu</p>
<h3>Rambling on Mencius</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>There was a period—it seems to be around the time of the Northern Expedition—when leaders in cultural circles strongly opposed students reading ancient books, and a small number expressed approval, but their voice was not strong, and it was not in line with the atmosphere at the time. Finally, apart from being treasured by antiquarians, ancient books became very unfashionable, retreating to a corner of culture that people did not pay attention to or value. The book of Mencius is one of them.</p>
<p>In the past, scholars listed the Four Books as essential reading, starting from "Confucius said" and "The Book of Poetry." I guess these books had a significant impact on Chinese culture. Some say that the benevolence and righteousness advocated by Confucius and his followers seem to have never been practiced in China, and ten people who read it are no better than those who have never read it. But it must be known that if people in the past did not read the books of Confucius and Mencius, things might have been worse, and it is also not necessarily.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, ancient books are not unworthy of reading, but they should not be read too early. Taking the book of Mencius as an example, I once read it thoroughly under the supervision of the "old-fashioned teacher," and it can be said that I read it so well that I could recite it. As for understanding, I can't say that I didn't understand it at all, but I always felt that the words in this book were very ordinary, and even if they were not said, I already knew them, so I thought it was very pedantic. So, when I read Mencius at that time, it was like Mencius playing the lute to a cow, and I felt nothing in my heart and was not moved. Instead, I loved to read books that were far from reality, such as Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu. After the age of thirty, when I read Mencius again, it was like seeing a new thing, and my eyes lit up. It felt like the ancient poem "The pomegranate flowers in May shine brightly," and the more I read it, the more fresh and delightful it became, and it was endlessly beautiful, like a village after village in a dark willow and bright flowers.</p>
<p>Someone said: When it comes to democracy, Mencius is more democratic than today's people. The "kingly way" that Mencius advocated, as opposed to hegemony, seems mysterious, but in fact it is "benevolent governance." "Benevolent governance" is nothing more than a political system that puts the interests of the people first. The slogan of the "kingly way" is: "Heaven sees as my people see, Heaven hears as my people hear." In today's words, this is to emphasize "public opinion." Starting from this major premise, he said: "When a ruler promotes the worthy, it is unavoidable that he will cause the lowly to surpass the noble and the distant to surpass the close. Should he not be cautious? If those on the left and right all say he is worthy, that is not enough; if the senior officials all say he is worthy, that is not enough; if the people of the country all say he is worthy, then investigate him. If you see that he is truly worthy, then use him." This is very similar to today's "universal suffrage system." When a ruler promotes the worthy, it is permissible for the lowly to surpass the noble and the distant to surpass the close, which means not employing private individuals. Mencius also said: "If those on the left and right all say he is unfit, do not listen to them; if the senior officials all say he is unfit, do not listen to them; if the people of the country all say he is unfit, then investigate him. If you see that he is truly unfit, then remove him." This is today's "right of recall." He also said: "If those on the left and right all say he should be killed, do not listen to them; if the senior officials all say he should be killed, do not listen to them; if the people of the country all say he should be killed, then investigate him. If you see that he should be killed, then kill him. Therefore, it is said: 'The people of the country killed him.'" This method seems to be a step further than today's judicial "jury system."</p>
<p>During the time when the spirit of democracy had not yet prevailed, China and other countries in the world regarded the emperor, the ruler of a country, with mysterious respect, to the point of being sacred and inviolable. But Mencius had long believed that it was permissible to kill a monarch who brought disaster to the country and harmed the people: "King Xuan of Qi asked: 'Tang banished Jie, and King Wu attacked Zhou. Is there such a thing?' Mencius replied: 'There is such a thing in the records.' The king said: 'Is it permissible for a subject to kill his ruler?' Mencius said: 'One who injures benevolence is called a robber, and one who injures righteousness is called a destroyer. A person who is both a robber and a destroyer is called a solitary man. I have heard of the execution of the solitary man Zhou, but I have not heard of the killing of a ruler.' Mencius said to King Xuan of Qi: 'If one of your ministers entrusts his wife and children to a friend and goes to travel in Chu, and when he returns, his wife and children are starving and cold, what should be done?' The king said: 'Abandon him.' Mencius said: 'If the officers are unable to govern the soldiers, what should be done?' The king said: 'Dismiss them.' Mencius said: 'If the country within the four borders is not well-governed, what should be done?' The king looked to the left and right and spoke of other things." The people can use the right of recall against the ruler of a country. If he still refuses to step down, the people can kill him. This is Mencius's ideal.</p>
<p>In Mencius's mind, the monarch is merely a member of the division of labor, a link in the communication and exchange of affairs. The laborer provides a portion of the harvest of his labor to the monarch who labors with his mind. The monarch labors with his mind and worries his spirit, seeking happiness for the people and eliminating disasters, so that the laborer can peacefully engage in his work. This can also be said to be: "Trade and retire, each getting what he wants." Emperors and monarchs are not inherently sacred or great. Therefore, Mencius knew how to respect himself in front of kings: "Mencius was about to go to court, and the king sent someone to say: 'I would like to see you, but I have a cold and cannot be exposed to the wind. Tomorrow I will go to court. I don't know if I can see you?' Mencius replied: 'Unfortunately, I have an illness and cannot go to court.' The next day, he went to offer condolences at the home of Dongguo. Gongsun Chou said: 'Yesterday you were ill, but today you are offering condolences. Is this not improper?' Mencius said: 'Yesterday I was ill, but today I am better. Why should I not offer condolences?' The king sent someone to inquire about his illness. The doctor came. Meng Zhongzi replied: 'Yesterday I had a royal command, and I had the worry of gathering firewood and could not go to court. Now my illness is slightly better, and I am rushing to go to court. I don't know if I can get there.' He sent several people to wait on the road, saying: 'Please do not return, but go to court.' He had no choice but to stay overnight at the home of Jing Chou. Jingzi said: 'Internally, there are fathers and sons; externally, there are rulers and ministers. These are the great human relations. Fathers and sons value kindness, and rulers and ministers value respect. I have seen the king's respect for you, but I have not seen you respect the king.' Mencius said: 'Alas, what are you saying? The people of Qi do not speak to the king of benevolence and righteousness. Is it because they do not think benevolence and righteousness are beautiful? In their hearts, they say: "Is he worthy of being spoken to about benevolence and righteousness?" Then there is no greater disrespect than this. If it is not the way of Yao and Shun, I would not dare to present it before the king. Therefore, no one in Qi respects the king as much as I do.' Jingzi said: 'No, that is not what I mean. The Book of Rites says: "When a father calls, do not refuse. When a ruler commands, do not wait for the carriage." You were going to go to court, but when you heard the king's command, you changed your mind. This seems to be inconsistent with the rites.' Mencius said: 'What are you talking about? Zengzi said: "The wealth of Jin and Chu cannot be matched, but they rely on their wealth, and I rely on my benevolence. They rely on their rank, and I rely on my righteousness. Why should I be dissatisfied?" If it were not righteous, Zengzi would not have said it. This is probably one way. There are three universally respected things: rank, age, and virtue. In the court, there is nothing like rank; in the village, there is nothing like age; in helping the world and fearing the people, there is nothing like virtue. How can one neglect the other two because of one?' Therefore, a ruler who intends to achieve great things must have ministers who he does not summon. If he wants to consult with them, he will go to them. If he does not respect virtue and delight in the Way, he is not worth achieving great things with. Therefore, Tang learned from Yi Yin before making him his minister, so he became king without effort. Duke Huan of Qi learned from Guan Zhong before making him his minister, so he became hegemon without effort. Today, the land and virtue of the world are equal, and no one can surpass the other. There is no other reason than that they like to make their teachers their ministers, but they do not like to make their students their ministers. Tang did not dare to summon Yi Yin, and Duke Huan did not dare to summon Guan Zhong. Guan Zhong was already someone who could not be summoned, let alone someone who is not like Guan Zhong!'" This speech is so backbone-filled, yet so out of touch with the times. If Mencius were alive today, would he be "sprouting bean sprouts"?</p>

It is hoped that young professionals in this city, all those who suffer from trachoma or have slight symptoms of trachoma, should seek examination and treatment as soon as possible, and do not miss the opportunity!</p>
<h3>News of Anti-Japanese War Soldiers is Unknown—A Septuagenarian Mother is Forced to Appeal</h3>
<p>Inquiring about the survival of Ying Fuquan</p>
<p>My son, Ying Fuquan, is from Yingjia Village outside the South Gate of Cixi, Ningbo. He enlisted in the army in November 1939, at the age of 27. It was not until August 1941 that he sent back a letter, stating that he was serving as a platoon leader in the 147th Regiment in Shangrao, Jiangxi. In December of the same year, another letter came, stating that he had been promoted from platoon leader to company commander. At that time, the situation in central Hunan was urgent, and he was transferred to Changsha to defend the city and was promoted to battalion commander. Later, he was transferred to Yunnan for operations, serving as the auxiliary battalion commander of the 73rd Regiment of the 190th Division of the Third Army. Since then, there has been no news. He left behind his unfortunate mother, who is over 70 years old, and an even more unfortunate daughter-in-law, who have depended on each other for the past nine years and have suffered unspeakable hardships. We hoped that the anti-Japanese war would be won and that the soldiers would return to their hometowns. Unexpectedly, three years after the victory, there is still no news. Currently, the war is still going on, and conscription is still taking place in the countryside. The local township office has even denied that we are family members of soldiers and ordered us to pay various fees. I am over 70 years old and suffering from illness and poverty. I rely solely on my widowed daughter-in-law to do needlework to make a living, and we are on the verge of starvation. Now, because the township is forcing us to pay, we have sold our possessions and come to Shanghai to look for my son. If any of my son Fuquan's old friends know of his whereabouts, please have pity on our suffering and send us a letter to inform us. We also implore the Ministry of National Defense to investigate and provide proof to avoid the various hardships in the countryside. Your kindness will be equivalent to a second life! Weeping, Ying Miao, the sufferer. Correspondence address: Hu Jinfatransfers Shanghai, Yuyao Road 946.</p>
