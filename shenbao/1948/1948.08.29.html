<h3 id="c1">總統埀詢滬市金融　政院同時邀負責人談話　勉以切實努力協助生產 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕總統廿八日下午四時在官邸　獨接見交通銀行董事長錢新之，垂詢幣制改革後滬市金融情形，並聰取錢氏意見。錢氏當向總統提出三項建議：（一）幣制改革爲適時之舉措，雖爲時已覺稍晚，但改革後反應極佳，希望政府能以最大決心加强執行，並希望政府充實發行準備，對於國營事業資產應早日完成發行股票，變爲有價證券。（二）金元券發行後，因人民紛紛以金·銀·外幣兌換金元券，市場游資事實上已較前增加，對此增加之游資，希望政府能運用有效辦法，導人正途，以免刺激物價。（三）穩定物價，以促進工業之生產，總統表示甚爲首肯，談話歷一小時，錢氏始行辭出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕行政院長翁文灝，廿八日下午三時半在政院邀集　商業行莊首長及市商會及銀錢業公會負責人舉行談話會，到徐寄廎，李　蓀，秦潤卿（沈日新代）及陳光甫（伍克家代），杜月笙，宋子良，傳沐波，兪佐廷，王孟　，徐國懋，談公遠，王紹賢，載銘禮，王志幸，饒韜叔等十餘人，財長王雲五，財次徐柏園亦均參加，談話會共歷兩小時許始畢，開會時首由翁院長及王財長說明召集談話會之意義，在檢討一週來有關金融經濟之措施，翁氏首對一週來金融界忠實奉行國策，表示慰勉，並對今後各行莊壓平市塲利率，協助生產事業，繳存外匯基金，暢通國內匯兌各節分別指示，勉辦續切實努力辦理，並希望滬工商界及金融領袖與政府切實合作，俾財政經濟緊急處分令能貫激執行。翁·一致詞畢，即由李馥蓀，徐寄廎起立發言，說明滬工商界遵照政府財政經濟緊急處分令及總統前次召集談話會時面諭之意旨分別辨理情形，並確實表示對政府未辦事項金融界必定一致擁護，繼續推行。旋復由杜月笙，王志莘，兪佐廷等多人相繼發言，根出建議，綜合其要點爲：（一）行莊利息希望逐漸壓低，不作硬性規定，如規定九月一日以後壓低至一角以內，十六日以後壓低至五分以內，實嫌過低，將影響正當工商業之生存，並將形成資金不向外貸放現象。（二）行莊增資希望不要過高，而兩月之內增資完成，尤嫌限制時間太短，對上海行莊應增爲一百萬金元一黜，表示決非大多數行莊所能負担。（三）證交奉令暫停營業，希望於短期內恢復。（四）立法院正討論收同中·交·農行商股，希望政府能重加考慮，如政府認爲中·交·農行中商股之理監事人選未盡適宜，可以更換，但不贊成商股由中央收買。至對於外匯基金繳存中央銀行一點，則表示決與政府合作，儘量繳存，並表示一一日內將在滬召集銀錢業及商業行莊首長舉行會議，商討繳存之技術問題。最後，翁院長作結論，表示對滬金融界之意見均已親自紀錄，留作將來參考，凡可行者，決儘量考慮採納。又李馥蓀，王志莘廿八日晚六時返滬，杜月笙，徐寄廎則分乘廿八日夜車及廿九日早車返滬。又來京出席四聯理事會之各國家行局首長錢新之，席德懋，程遠帆等亦於廿八日夜車返滬。</p>

<p>四聯理事會議</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕四聯總處廿八日上午舉行第三七〇次理事會議，由翁院長文灝主席，出席理事王雲五，陳啓天，劉攻芸，宋漢章，錢新之及秘書長徐柏園等，首由秘書處報告財政經濟緊急處分令實施後該處遵辦經過暨對各地反應情形，大體言之，均呈穩定現象。嗣由各行局庫首長報告發行金圓券後一般業務概况，對於收兌金銀外幣工作，咸表樂觀，計截至廿六日止，據已接到之報告，共收黃金于萬零一千七百餘市兩，白銀廿萬零五千三百餘市兩，銀元九十萬六千二百餘元，美鈔五百十五萬餘元，港幣九百廿萬餘元，共計折合美金約一千二百萬元，今後各行局庫將就收兌技術上當更求改進，以便利顧客。旋由翁院長指示，略以經濟改革已獲初步成功，今後對於安定市塲，調節供需，嚴禁投機，取締黑市，疏導資金，協助生產各項工作，應密謀配合，以加速完成改革政策。繼討論提案。</p>
<p>一，關於今後放款方針，應如何厘訂一案，經就原則上決定三點。</p>
<p>（一）下半年度總預算，依照金圓單位改編後，各機關應依照公庫法之規定，分期領用，所有以預算指抵之借款，應予停止。</p>
<p>（二）市塲利率逐漸降低，原有差別利率標準。應予廢止，未到期放款，自本月廿三日起，照新辦法計息。</p>
<p>（三）物價平穩，產銷漸趨正常，原有定貨貸款及委託產製方式，停止適用，必要時以收購方式辦理。</p>
<p>至於貸款對象及範圍暨貨款審核手續，事後考核等項。應如何重新確定，將交由專案商討後，再提核議。</p>
<p>二，國內匯款匯率應予逐漸平抑，並應由各行局依照下列原則辦理。</p>
<p>（一）各行局承做匯款，應予從低收費，由中央銀行隨時調撥頭寸</p>
<p>（二）行局承做匯款，仍應遵照財政部規定辦法，嚴格查明匯款人之姓名，住址及匯款用途等，以杜流弊。</p>
<p>三，修訂中央銀貼放委員會辦理同業貼放暫行規則。（全文見左角）</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕張厲生偕王撫洲廿八日晨八時赴津。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿八日電〕張厲生，王撫洲，廿八日最抵津。張氏於談話中，强關指出一般人民已盡將所有金鈔特出兌換金圓券，至足令人感動，現在特別希望銀行，錢莊。公司，商店，存有金銀外幣者，亦踴躍拿出，應知如此並非損失，而假使經濟改革方案失敗，則全民將同遭重大經濟危機，關於穩定物價，張氏稱：政府將通盤研究各貨產運銷成本，俾求物價恢復正常狀態，目前之限價雖不能謂爲短期者，但亦不能謂將長期凍結。對東北資金內流問題，氏稱，將由王撫洲司長研究解決辦法。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿八日電〕據王撫洲司長談輔幣問題稱：政府戰時存有鎳幣數千噸，正分運各地供應需要，此外，銀輔幣銅輔幣正大批趕鑄中。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽廿八日電〕東北高粱將熟，當局重視秋收，省市縣決即成立民衆自衛委員會，加强經濟作戰，保土收糧，各縣駐軍首長兼任自衛委會主委。遼主席王鐵漢，瀋市長董文琦，亦均兼任民衆自衛委員會主委。又，秋收在邇，吉林，遼北，地區匪刻組織「搶糧游繫隊」準備廣泛游竄搶糧。</p>
<p>剿總政委會九一改組</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿八日電〕據悉：東北剿總政委會，已接行政院電令，自九月一日改組新編制，政委會設主委一人，簡派委員十四人，秘書長一人，設政務，經濟，文教，土地四處，簡派視察專員五至七人，該會刻考慮改組技術閒題。東北環境特殊，組織方面或較規定稍大，改組勢在必行，被裁人員妥善安置，不致失業。</p>
<h3 id="c5">監院四委會舉行會議　商提高公教待遇　決議移送財政委會討論 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕監院經·濟·資源·農林·水利委會，廿八日晨舉行會議，討論柴峯之提案，一件「請糾正政府依照戰前標準，提高公教人員之待遇案」。經與會各委員紛紛發言，多數對該案所提公教人員待過問題，認爲有提請政府注意之必要，惟是否必須提出糾正案，尚待研究。當經決議移送該院財政委會續予討論。茲誌該案內容大要如次：「政府稅收及國營事業之收費，均將參照戰前標準調整。惟獨公教人員之待遇，仍循舊制辦法，距離戰前標準甚遠。然財政經濟關係整個政治，如欲政治淸明，必要做到：（一）鏟除貪污，（二）提高效能。但欲達到此二者，則必須提高文武公教人員之待遇。依照新制，公教人員待遇改以金圓支給，但此金圓折合戰前銀元，僅爲其半，無形已打對折，京滬區標準以原薪額四十元爲基數發金圓，實際僅得戰前銀元廿元。以原薪八百元計可得金圓一四二元，合銀元爲七十一元，不及戰前十分之一。高級主管或可利用職權得到補助。是以爲求鏟除貪污，提高效能，在新幣制下之公教人員待遇，必須免去另自設法之補助，並應照戰前稅收等標準，一併提高，不予折扣。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕經濟緊一急處分令公布前夕，某赴滬作投機因而獲暴利之某隱名人士，各方極爲注意。監院於廿八日晨小組委會中，亦曾就此交換意見，認爲應予追究。惟曾中並未作何種決議。另悉坐鎭滬市督導施行財經緊急處分令之蔣經國，頃亦已矚目於此，若干人士均寄望於蔣氏之重大措施。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕文武職人負薪餉分區支給標準，經政院決議，規定自八月份起實行，並改發金圓券，其標準以京滬區爲代表，四十元爲基數，超過四十元至三百元之底薪者，其超過額以百分之廿計算，三百元以上者一律作百分之十計算，至京滬區以外地區，物價有低於京滬區者則减支若干，有高出者即增加若干，其中增减之成數，均以稅額計算，例如重慶則依照規定標準，减少百分之廿，依原定標準，總額爲一百金圓者，因須减扣百分之廿，故實領數目爲八十元，又如瀋陽依照規定標準，加百分之二百，則依京滬區標準，每月可領一百圓金圓者，再增加成數而爲三百金圓，茲將分區及適用地區列下：</p>

<h3 id="c14">哀矜的用心與除惡的決心 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>—清除職業學生中對大學敎授和當局說幾句話—</p>
<p>在此改革幣　穩定經濟辦法推行之中，政府另一重要措施是積極淸除社會潛伏的共匪間諜，包括主導學潮的職業學生的淸查與取締。在經濟緊急處分令前三天，政院令知各地治安當局的四項辦法中，其一就是嚴禁學生意圖妨害戡亂之罷課游行鼓煽等行爲，並指定此種現行犯由特種刑庭處理。總統廿二日談話，於經濟措施之外，特別重申取締共黨在學府中搗亂的決心。最近旬日中，首都以及平津滬杭各地治安當局，已有協助執行此項命令的行動，特種刑庭也在依法傳訊之中。我們愛護教育，會數次爲文籲請大學師生要自動制裁破壞學校的學生，現在情形稍異，願再對大學校長教授說幾句話，並對執行此一任務的當局提供一些意見。</p>
<p>首先我們要指陳此輩受高等教育的靑年，不能受理智的黨陶，而竟受共黨的利用，或無意被其操縱而不自覺，卒至要受國法的制裁，或證據確鑒而判處罪罰，成挺而走險而奔向匪區，都是一種時代的悲哀。但同時我們也要指出，道次淸除匪諜必須包括其在大學裏活動的重要分予，是與經濟改革一樣適應時代需要與與論要求的大事，也同樣是政府一件不容「再事姑息」的責任。這件事必須做得澈底，才能恢復大學的安定；與改革幣制一樣，這一椿大工作，只許成功，不容失敗。</p>
<p>我們認爲淸除學生中害羣之馬，是順應與論要求之事。因爲現在除非盲目式存心爲共匪外圍的人，決沒有再不相信年來大舉學潮是由共黨職業學生核心主導的。只要略作回溯，我們都記得起大學生罷課示威等行爲，是從去年五月動員戡亂命令以後才多起來。越是剿共軍事緊張，這種毀滅性的學潮也越是繁多蔓延而且暴烈。據教部統計，此一學年中共發生學潮九十六次，求學時間的曠誤達五百〇六天之多。尤其自今年四五月以後，他們的鼓煽活動更見暴烈，學生群衆大家明白一切學潮是由共黨僭竊把持爲主導。一般科學家教授與校長，往往不信任政府的提示，久被他們所豪蔽愚弄，現在也痛感學生程度之日降，社會同情之日益喪失，漸已覺察一切不安之源由於潛伏的共匪，其行爲已不能容忍。最痛心疾首的當然是學生們的家長，他們眼看以汗血供應的學費有如虛擲，大冬致　於學校和政府的過度優容。所以，正猶法幣貶值已到極致而深受人民詬病，學府裏職業學生之搗亂橫行，也已到社會所不能忍受的</p>
<p>政府所以對生事滋亂的學生向取比較溫和寬容的態度，不僅是「投鼠忌器」的心理，也可說是過度尊重學者與教授的地位，原來希望由他們的教化來解決學校本身內的事情。可是事實證明辦不到，到今日乃不能不採取壓力來淸除。至於授權特種司法機構來處理，可說是極不得已的事情。我們已提到這樣方式來取締學潮是今日中國一件可悲的事，可是我們另一方面必須提醒校長教授諸君，這是爲國家爲教育前途不能不故而且必須大家合力來做的事。</p>
<p>事實本極明顯，可是我們在今日還來贅說一番，是因爲專家教授專其所學，往往「君子可欺以其方」，或者過量自尊大事的地位與皇田；而一部分靑年講師教授，更有感受簧鼓似的煽動，由不滿現狀而遷怒於政府之任何行動，因而可能爲當局執行之阻力。在目前各著名太學校長的反應是很公明的：北大胡校長竹提到大學生不是租界中人，上海交大王代校長說政府依法辦理，學校不能保護非法份子，南就金火陳校長謂「學校教育剛在培養靑年，同時亦教育靑年尊重法律」，均能認爲政府依法辦理，學生必須遵從，確能表明一種根本意義。不過我們仍深切的期望學校當局共來負責，因爲通是爲學校本身利益的事，校長仍必須挺身當前，固不能完全信託治安與司法機關來辦理而不問，更不應有對等或偏袒的心理而蒙蔽遺禍。校長教授平日與學生接觸較多，觀察較周，雖說若千大學規模太大，但究竟比較憲警偵查耳目更切。爲恢復學校安定，淸除害馬固然要緊，保護善良使無寃屈也是必要，這兩者同時需要學校當局坦白提供材料，予治安當局以執行上應有的助力。凡深受毒化訓練蓄意破壞的靑年，實在無可姑息，學校必須同樣有除惡的決心，然後才能保障純正學生與學校的利益。　其次，我們要提起執行政院命令的地方行政治安機關的注意，共產黨在學校尤其高等教育方面的「學運」工作，同是陰謀已久，現在已到了澈底淸除匪諜不容姑息的時機。但這裏有最重要的一個前提，就是政府爲掃除軍事阻力與安定秩序而出此舉，可是另一個目的還是眞正愛護教育，要回復大學的安定與進步。因此，執行者固然抱着治安至上的心理，但亦決不可忽略教育的立塲，不可傷害學校當局與多數純潔學生的感情。我們曾切盼治安當局要負責，也要愼重。我國先代大政治家治罪正刑，所謂「哀矜勿喜」，正足以代表今日政府消除匪黨學生的心情。主持治安警備與特種司法的負責者，必須體會這一種用心，才能善於貫澈此一任務。我們清除害馬，爲的保護多數善良學生的求學權利；我們取締反動，是爲保全國家高等教育的會議。無論過去在職業學生主導下對政府討軍警有如何侮辱不示的行為，今日決不能略有報復的心理，而催有絕對遵守法紀而行事。簡單的說：執行治安的當局，立場要堅定，手段卻要溫和；方法可以斷決，態度卻仍須和平。以此取得學校當局的同情與合作，可收事半功倍之效；否則打草驚蛇枝節橫生，反不能達成任務。至於特種刑庭主管人員，他們當然有法律智，識，但更要有政治風度。從偵查而得的名單未必全般可靠，所以傳訊必須縝密，證據必須求其周備，務求無枉無縦。學校當局或有偏護姑息之事，但特刑庭如舉措文明而愼重，在今日大勢之下必能得到學校的協助。用哀矜的心理，來輔翼執法的責任心，那麽緘信感孚，就是血氣方剛的靑年，也能平情而心服了。</p>
<p>我們又感到敎育行政當局，在此秋季尚未開學，而治安司法機關已在執行命令之際，不但不能鬆懈其責任，並且更要挺身負責，作全盤的積極的策劃，來配合此一嚴肅的任務。已在教部對大學聲　，不容韓首的只有技節應付。辦法不統一，往往事後查辦，很少事先消弭。規在政府起而負責，教部決不能從此卸責，而須多方供給材料，提供辦法，多方協助治安當局，以自讀其過去未善盡的實任。</p>
<p>最後，我們願再向大學校長教授與崇尚理智的純正學生申說一句：政府此次的決心與舉動，不僅是政治上的必要，也是謀教育安全的唯一出路。我們必須認識，共匪之破壞與叛亂，已到與教育與國家利益絕對相背的地步；今日之舉，是爲淸除叛徒，絕不是「迫害」靑年、是肅淸國家生存的障碍，絕沒有侵犯學府的自由；是驅除反科學反敎育的魔鬼，絕不是破壞學術與教育的尊嚴。政府固當存謹慎小心的態度，而大學師生必須認淸時代，辨明利害，協同合作，才能使當局善盡任務，恢復學府的安定與進步。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕計劃潛往匪區參加叛亂工作之中大學生朱成學，華彬淸，李飛及共匪連絡員陶元貴，唐世貴等五人，前經首都特種刑庭審訊終結，於廿八日上午十時五十分宣判。判決主文如下：「陶元貴唐世貴共同意圖破壞國體，竊據國土，而選續着手實行，應處有期徒刑十年，褫奪公權十年」。「朱成學共同意圖破壞國體竊據國土，而預備着手實行，處有期徒刑六年，褫奪公權六年」。「華彬淸，李飛共同意圖破壞國體竊據國土，而預備着手實行，各處有期徒刑五年，各褫奪公權五年」。</p>
<p>審判長解釋</p>
<p>審判長宣判後並解釋謂：陶元貴與唐世貴爲匪作交通連絡工作，曾數次獲送學生前往匪區，原應處以死刑或無期徒刑，姑念其爲工人，知識淺薄，犯罪情節雖然可惡，然係無知而被利用，特予從輕量刑，减處有期徒刑十年，朱成學等三人原係一致行動，然根據警察廳訊問時李飛，華彬淸之口供謂，係朱成學邀行，顯然朱係主動，故朱處刑多一年，按照起訴書內三人罪行亦應處死刑或無期徒刑，惟以「與民盟連絡包圍靑年部」等情僅有嫌疑，而未獲確切證據，故僅就「有到巢縣匪區工作的準備」，根據戡亂時期緊急治罪條例第二條第三項應處有期徒刑十年，但念汝等大學生，國家已費財力栽培，對汝等尚寄存希望並爲不影響汝等前途再减低一半。在法律上處刑已减無可减，只要你們今後守法，甚至可特予提前假釋出獄。本庭處理此案係經愼重考慮，如尚有不服之處，可於收到判決書十日之內，聲請中央特刑庭覆判。」朱成學等對此次處刑之從輕發落，似覺意外，故有驚喜感悟之表情，蓋判決前朱犯等皆頻頻探聽是否將受極刑。陶元貴似不勝懺悔，請求審判長開恩，謂家有老父無人養活，請爲减刑。審判長斥之謂：「汝法已從輕量刑，判決已定，以後守法，即可早日出獄。」至此庭諭五犯還押退庭。</p>

<p>〔本報靑島廿七日訊〕幣制改革以後，靑島美駐軍將每月以美金八十萬元，交付中央銀行，兌取金圓券發餉，以及發給華籍與其他國籍職員工人薪工。除其中百分之三十將流回美方外，政府可能獲得四十至五十萬美元頭寸。其全年數額，足供國軍一百個師以上開支一個月。</p>
<p>過去美鈔十九南渣，故過去三年間，美軍流入靑島市塲之千萬美金，正常估計仍留靑市者當在百萬元左右。惟自央行開兌新幣以來，第一日異常擁擠，達二十萬元，以後數日間則不能破此紀錄，截止目前爲止，尚不足三十萬元。</p>
<p>西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾中將宣佈竭誠合作，使靑市流通美鈔現象完全停止，在開兌之日，陸戰隊司令司密斯少將以及靑島海港勤務部長約翰生上尉特諭所部，切實連守，並將如何由軍郵局儲畜及兌付美金回國辦法告知其部下。此後美鈔流通現象究否能完全絕跡，則胥視物價發展趨勢而定，尤要者，則美士兵是否將由此而不顧上級之命令，而仍索美金。</p>
<p>惟就事實而論，金圓券出現之第一日，美金黑市均可稱完全絕跡。如中央銀行附近，濰縣路一帶，過去人頭擠擠，公開活動，或可謂全國惟一之奇跡者，頓告消滅，嚴如曾經惡戰之戰塲，此時荒凉靜寂，徒令人憑弔。但近日以來，又有黑市之謠發現，所謂「金鈔犯」者陸續被捕，三日來達二百五十人。此輩經營黑市一，累年積月，約計千餘人，但僅賴四處奔走搜求，以供大戶，而博徵利者。故過去之特別公開現一象，官府幾如無覩者，一方面固可作捕不勝捕解，另一方面則不免令人疑竇發生，新市長襲學遂向被稱爲幹練之人才，接事後曾於街頭參觀黑市，不免驚駭，不數日幣制宣告改革，而今後將如何澈查大戶，或竟與綏區合作，斷然搜查私宅，亦將視其如何計副與當前之困難搏門而定。</p>
<p>此後是否將仍蹈故轍，關鍵緊之於全面，固非靑島一隅可單獨論斷者，但靑市之現象，無疑亦可爲今後之指標也。</p>

<p>〔中央紐約廿七日電〕魯斯主辦之生活雜誌，今起連續刊載美前任駐蘇聯與法國大使蒲立德氏所作之論文，蒲氏論文以「吾人如何嬴得戰爭復失却和平」爲題，將一九三三年以迄於今，在羅斯福與杜魯門二氏先後主政下，美國外交政策加以分析。對美國在今日世界之處境，其進入此種處境之原因，以及其目前之動向皆有論列。但蒲氏自稱：此係渠個人之觀測。蒲氏於論文之第一篇中，以戰後美國之不安歸咎於羅斯福。渠指責故總統未能於戰時爲美國租借援助討取報酬，要求史達林保證尊重美國在一自由獨立之歐洲與一自由獨立之中國之重大利益。蒲氏稱：一九四一年史達林與希特勒之鬥爭使美國在世界政治獲有控制權力，乃美國竟不利用此種權力，命史達林保證，戰爭結束後歐洲與亞洲須享有自由與和平。蒲氏論文稱：當時渠與若干其他人員，皆曾力勸羅斯福須致史達林書，就正式公開保證充諾將來不侵犯歐洲，亦不對中國提出要求始予蘇聯以租借援助，惜蒲氏等之建議，羅斯福竟予棄置不理，蓋羅氏認爲：（一）此種保證無甚價值，因史達林對其所作保證，以後可廢棄也；（二）渠（羅氏）自信可以安撫辦法，將史達林自蘇維埃帝國主義者化爲民主形式之合作。故今日局勢之造成，羅斯一福之此種決定，實有以致之。蒲氏堅稱：渠之獻策如獲採行，則史達林必難獲得對東歐一億二千萬人民之統治如其今日所爲者然。而中國之共黨威脅亦必已消除矣。縱令史達林不顧信義廢棄諾言，美國人民亦可聽此知所警惕，即作應變準備也。蒲氏論文中對美國之對華對日政策，以及因此而造成之中國局勢，亦屢有論列。其大意稱：羅斯福於一九三三年就任總統時，對於美國之外交政策具有一項肯定信念，即一九三一年日本侵略中國所造之後果，不能因堅持胡佛總統拒絕承認任何足以損害中國主權獨立與領土完整之協定之政策而獲得適當處置，羅氏之見解旣如此，故渠曾訓令赫爾國務卿通知日本，事實上美日兩國間之種種問題，並無不可以和平方法加以解決者。蒲氏稱：美國政府依賴此種和平方法之肯定信念，爲美國姑息日本不智政策之濫　，結果乃有珍珠港不幸事件之發生。論文復稱；羅斯福當政三年後，至一九三六年初，美國即陷於全面孤立之境，其時各主要國家中，唯有蔣委員長領導下之中國，尚能與吾人密切合作。同年三月七日，希特勒進兵萊因區，而日本可能將再度攻擊中國之惡耗亦傳抵華府，是年夏，羅斯福始被迫根據美國之安全需要，重估國際大局，重估後，羅氏結論之一，即爲美國人民可能時將藉和平方法，必要時得假戰爭手段，以阻止任何國家之摧毀中國獨立動員中國人力與資源，終而攻擊美國。蒲氏稱：此乃舊時門戶開放政策之一新發展地，一九三七年日本入侵後，羅斯福始悟其維持美國於和平狀態之願望，與其防止日本最後動員中國人力物力對美作戰之意岡相抵觸，故十月五日，羅氏即發表其「對侵略者檢疫」之演說，而該篇演說在國內引起强烈之敵視行動，因之兩月後，日本於南京附近擊沉美國巴納號砲艦後，羅斯福仍繼讀允許日本在美購買其侵略中國所必需之物資，廢鐵亦爲其中之一項。蒲立德曾建議「要求史達林提出書面保證，作爲美國對蘇實行租借之交換條件，羅斯福亦予以拒絕，而甘冒德被擊敗後蘇聯可能佔領並統治中東歐，而日本被擊敗後，蘇聯將威脅中國主權獨立及領土完整之危險」。自羅斯福決定孤注一擲，仗其能力安撫史達林而圖將其蘇聯帝國主義轉變爲與吾人之民主式合作後，羅氏曾竭其所能取悅於蘇聯之獨裁者，隨後國內之親蘇宣傳，即全面展開，其中之一項，即謂中國共黨「僅爲土地改革者而與莫斯科無關」，同時華盛頓方面即樹立同情蘇聯者之聯絡網，而當時派往中國政府及拉丁美洲之顧問，實際上即爲蘇聯政策辯解者。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　麗天</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿四日航訊〕自從有歷史記載以來，黃河已經改道過七次，決口一五八〇次，無數的生命財產被斷送，國家元氣被　　，因此，黃水雖是中華古文化的發源地，也是中華民族的搖籃，但她所遺留給國人的，也只是無數慘痛的記憶。目下又屆秋汛季節，在全國各地，水災特多的今年，記者自更不能忘懷此災患特多的黃河，因趁黃河上游陝州第四次漲水預計廿四日可流經省境洛口之際，特赴沿河作實地勘察。</p>
<p>由黃河河工總局山東修防處孔處長令　及陳工程司允恭等陪同，記者於廿四日淸晨搭吉普車離濟北行，車出天橋後，映入眼　的是彌地高粱，紅穗堅實，纍纍低垂於陽光反射中，蔚成一片黃色大海，允稱南國絕無北國僅有的奇觀。車至洛口後，我們首至防汛隊休憩，該隊門左，碑碣林立，類皆記載前人治黃勳績的記功碑，旋登河堤，只見水流湍急，波濤汹湧，奔騰澎湃，險象環生。據防汛隊某負責人告：目下水位已達卅公尺點零二，爲本年中水位最商紀錄，水距堤岸最高僅尚剩三公尺許，低則不及二公尺，而即就目下水位，其水面已遠較堤外高粱桿頂高出達三四尺，設一旦決堤，其爲害之烈，被災之廣，可以想見。</p>
<p>魯境險工多</p>
<p>由洛口向東，在國軍控制區卅五公里內，計有蓋家溝，姬家莊，後張莊，傅家莊，霍家溜，河套圈，陳孟圈，王家梨行，胡家岸等九處險工，由浴口向西廿二公里內，計有老鼠莊，楊莊，曹家圈，北店子等四處險工，由洛口北岸西向卅二公里內則有大王廟，王家窰，邱家岸，李家岸，席家道口，王莊，南壇，顧家溝，五里舖，徐家坊，袁索莊，水牛趙莊，豆腐渦等十三處險工，（其中王家窰顧家溝段在匪手），孔處長告訴我：黃河自孟津以下即有河防，但黃河西岸岸身總長，在河南約二百公里，河北百六十公里，在山東爲七百餘公里，如將收歸官守的民埝二百餘公里合併計入，達九百餘公里，故平均每十餘公里，即有險工人處，因此，黃河在山東境內石堤全長即達七十餘公里，故險工以魯境最多，黃河自淸咸豐五年第六次改道以來的九十三年中，所有決口，其中在山東者即佔總數三分之二。</p>
<p>黃河所以在山東決口特多的另一原因，乃係黃水入豫境後，河床最寬之處達二十餘里，而至魯境如洛口西北約二十公里之岳莊與曹家圈之間，河面寬僅四百餘公尺，至利津最狹處則僅三百餘公尺，故黃河河槽在豫境最大容水量可至三萬餘秒立方公尺，而入魯後僅爲八千秒立方公尺。</p>
<p>進向北店子</p>
<p>我們坐着吉普繼自洛口沿黃河堤經老鼠莊，楊莊，曹家圈，至北店子視察。過去黃堤西岸，遍植樹木，萬里一碧，極目無際，汽車在上面駛過時，堤外的人因被樹蔭遮蔽，可以看不到汽車，但自廿七年六月黃水在河南花園口第七次改道後，鄉民多認爲黃水不再來，十年來所有樹木，多被砍伐一空，今天不僅河堤不美觀，即遇有險上需用材料，臨時征集，亦困難叢多。</p>
<p>楊莊距濟市約十五六公里，距濟市舊機塲約八公里，此地爲濟市附近最大險工，水槽偏向南岸，水深達十五公尺，溜勢特烈，修防處於此遍修石堤，　禦洪水。楊莊北岸，即爲匪區，故此處防務，尤爲重要，我等於稍停片刻後，即繼續西進。</p>
<p>車過曹家圈附近時，十餘汎工，正以草包搶填一險工，孔處長說：你不要小覷了他，只要經數小時或一夜無人搶修，可能就會出亂子，過去黃河所以多決口，大部皆由於人諜的不臧，河工人員多舞弊自肥，不是工款不够，汎工不够，就是工料不够。</p>
<p>北店子是我們此行的終點，這裏是一古渡頭，河對岸就是齊河縣城，在火車未通前，由濟赴北平的人多經此至濟河打尖宿店。今未由於火車中斷，這裏也居然成了匪我物資對流的重要渡口，我們視察時就看到有騾馬拖運的大量棉紗上渡船向北運去。</p>
<p>施工五區域</p>
<p>由北店子向西便正式進入匪區，我們當然無法前往。孔處長說：河工以施工的難易，可分爲五區，第一爲純共匪控制區，此處不談，第二爲純國軍控制區，施工當無困難，第三爲匪我銜接區，困難就鮫多，第四爲緩衝地段，匪旣不敢來，我亦不敢去，但萬一決起口來，老百姓總是國家的，因此，我們總還是要想盡方法，動員人民，征工征料，予以搶修。第五爲匪軍竄擾地段，如去年魯西南朱口至董口一帶，匪我三進三出，今年亦兩進兩出，我修防人員殉職者三人，被俘失踪者達卅餘人，材料物資損失，不計其數。本年六月底，魯西告急，開封失守前，由董口臨匯集一帶工地逃出的員工，政府補貼他們的損失費只是每人三千萬，尚買不到一床被。但他們在萬分困難情形下已完成了最堅固的河防工程，一位服務河工四十餘年的七十六歲賀老先生文叟就說過：他這一生還沒見過「工堅料實」如此次魯西修防工程者。原因是魯西黃河只要決口一公尺，整個魯西甚至蘇北都要全成澤國，因此我們不得不盡最大的努力，甘冒一切困難，從事河堤的搶修。</p>
<p>秋訊可安渡</p>
<p>下午二時，記者返回濟南，這時洛口的水位已回降到廿九點二〇公尺。在歸途中，一個可喜的消息值得報導於國人的，是去年秋汛黃河上游陝州發大水共五次，洛口水位最高時達卅公尺半，今年陝州已四次漲水，浴口水位最高即爲今天的卅公尺點零二，加以黃河上游去年降雪較少，據修防處人員可靠的佔計，今年洛口的水位絕不致超過去年的耙錄，由於河防人員的晝夜嚴密守護，一年四汛（桃汛·伏汛·秋汛·凌汛·）中水位最高溜勢最猛的秋汛，當可平安渡過。</p>

<h3 id="c94">臺灣國民經濟鳥瞰 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 本報兼代特派員　吳守仁</p>
<p>〔本報台北廿六日航訊〕記者旅台八月，對台灣的經濟情况，曾經多所觀察，所得結論，就體系的構成來說，是以農業經濟爲主，工業經濟輔之。而分析言之，農業經濟的構成以糧食爲基礎。這裏先就其產量作一個概括的說明：</p>
<p>從日治時代　看糧食產量</p>
<p>台灣因爲天時和環境上的優越條件，糧食的收穫可以一年兩熟，在日治時代，曾經有「米倉」之稱，過去的最高產量是在民國廿七年，共有一百四十萬二千四百四十四噸，而本身的消耗量僅七十三萬四千五百十六噸，餘下的六十餘萬噸究全供應了日本本土的需要。就這麼多的供求差額看起來，我們可以想像農村經濟是多麼富裕。然而，農民的生活仍祗有溫飽，這原因當係因爲日本殖民地政策的程度榨取所致。</p>
<p>戰爭期間因肥料的缺少，和農村壯丁的徵用，糧食產量一年年銳减，至民國卅三年已僅剩一百〇六萬八千一百二十一噸了。而光復時期的卅四年，更祗有六十三萬八千八百二十八噸；從糧食過剩演變至糧食匱乏的階段，其銳减的程度是可驚的。我們研究其癥結，就需要先着眼於台灣的地質問題。事實上，構成台灣農業經濟社曾，簡直沒有先天條件可憑，地質是砂積層，不像內地可以靠自然的肥料濯溉，水流雖有十九條主要河川，而條條頑劣如黃河，假使不加適宜的疏導，非惟無水利可言，抑且年年因颱風洪水的影響而泛濫，貽害農田。因此，日治時代他們針對這兩個問題，灌溉則用化學肥料，最高的供給量達六十萬噸，治水則多做水利工程，全省的堤岸長達四一九，一五三公尺，不過日本政府的居心十分利害，所有供給台灣農田灌溉的肥料製造工廠，多設在日本本土，水利方面的堤防也是必須年年加以適宜的保養和修理，否則就失其效用，使台灣始終不能脫離日本，而成爲一假獨立生存的農案社會。所以，光復之後，第一個難題是肥料發生嚴重的恐慌，據統計：卅四年農民獲得政府供給肥料僅二千噸，第二個難題是堤防決口，大水泛濫，那時光復伊始，政府不及注意水利問題，據統計：卅四年及卅五年全省決口細敦堤岸達五萬盤公尺，吃　嬝田約十萬公頃，這兩者都是促使糧食產量銳减的主要原因。</p>
<p>謀水利建設　增肥料輸入</p>
<p>其後政府勵精圖治，首先謀水利建設和增加肥料輸入，時至今日，前者已修復長達二四·〇〇〇公尺的堤防，後者肥料的輸入在卅五年是八萬五千噸，因此，糧食產量得以遞增至八十九萬一千四百十七噸，適能符合本省的消耗量。至卅六年，肥料的輸入仍是八萬五千噸，因了水利的規復，耕地的增加和被徵壯丁的陸續歸來，糧食產量已增至九十九萬九千零一十二萬噸。卅七年中央撥給購自美國的肥料，共九萬五千噸，惟因糧食年度尚未終了，產量不能正確統計，但一般估計，當較去年增加不少。我們從前述的數字中，可以知道台灣糧食在卅五年已恢復了正常的供求平衡狀態，而從卅六年起更達到了供過於求的過剩階段，當全國正普遍鬧着糧荒的時候，這不能不說是台灣農業經濟的優越之處</p>

<p>除糧食以外而佔農業經濟重要一環的，應該屬於臺糖，台糖在內地飲譽最盛，婦孺皆知，即在國際市塲，亦頗具聲勢，這是日本殖民地政策所建立下來的基礎。據台灣父老的追溯，當民國廿四年，糧食產量多至一百三十餘萬噸的時候，日本政府即警覺於合灣糧食的高度過剩，將危害日本本土的農村經濟，因此採取了抑制生產的政策，爲了達成此種政策，合灣總督府强制合胞以一部份農田改植甘蔗，同時，日本財閥亦大量投資，在台灣各地闢設大規模的糖廠，以限價收買甘蔗加工製糖，一方面供應本土的需要，一方面傾銷國際市塲，而達到純粹榨取的目的記者爲什麼要說這是純粹的榨取，因爲台灣的天然條件如雨量，日光，氣溫，不適宜於種蔗，且颱風的侵害，對糖廠設備和甘蔗的影響都較糧食爲大，况且糧食一年兩熟，而甘蔗須十八個月纔能收穫，就農民本身的利害而言，處於日本財閥限價收購甘蔗的情况之下，種蔗並沒有實益可得，但因對日本有利的緣故，畢竟使台糖具備了今日的規模。</p>
<p>追溯造成台糖今日規模的歷史，這是一頁慘痛的回憶，廣表十二萬一千三百六十二甲（每甲合十四畝四分）來自農田的種蔗面積，都陸續在日轄台灣總督府的台灣糖業令下收歸公有，最高的產糖量達四十一萬八千噸，而蔗農所得到的，是從限價收購中所博取的菲薄的利潤，除了最低限度的衣食外，他們沒有嚐到比別人更多的甜味。光復之後，蔗田全部接收繼續種植，日商所經營的卅五個糖廠，亦都先後復工，到卅六年和卅七年期的產量，已達二十六萬三千五百九十六噸，其中本省的需要僅五萬一千噸，其餘都供應國內和南洋及日本市塲作宣傳性的傾銷。記者觀察今日台灣糖業與過去不同的特點，是過去乃日本榨項台灣的重要資源之一，而現在是晨村經濟的命脈之一，看合糖公司對蔗農的待遇，我們可以明瞭其中大概的情形。</p>
<p>蔗農分糖制　享四種貸款</p>
<p>雖說甘蔗需要十八個月纔能收穫，蔗農的收益在時間上須遲於田農十二個月，換一句話說，就是田農收獲三次，蔗農才收穫一次，其間的甘苦是可想而知的。但因了糖業公司有一個獨特的酬勞制度的緣故，蔗農的溫飽也是不成問題。這一個獨特的酬勞制度，就呌做分糖制度。簡括而言之，譬如一個蔗農所稱植而收穫的甘蔗能製造一千公斤糖，則這個蔗農除了可得五百公斤糖的折價外，其餘就可得五百公斤的實物（糖），讓蔗農去自由支配，自由賣買。目前糖業公司所定折價，是每公斤台幣三五〇元，除此之外，蔗農可以經常享受四種貸款，計蔗苗貸款耕作貸款，地租貸款，肥料貸款。目前蔗農，每戶每年期的平均生產量，約有四萬一千三百四十四公斤，其盈餘收穫用以支付十八個月的生活負担，也就應付裕如了。</p>

<p>— 本報通訊員　孟維忠</p>
<p>〔本報鎭海二十四日訊〕浙江之有佃農二五减租暫行辦法，遠在民國十五年間制定頭布，已歷二十多載。推行之初，不免困難重重，然經奉行各縣的成績，是「减少佃業糾紛」，於是官民稱便。浙東鎭海，得風氣之先，在减租辦法推行之始，即能首先澈底奉行，歷年來佃業雙方得能穩度「租關」，未使非此法之力。最近，我政府當局爲實行土地改革，爰有土地法之頒佈，消息傳播，農民歡騰，此間全縣佃農，以利權所關，於八月十一日特在報章上發佈「　海縣晨民爲擁護動員戡亂奉行土地法宣言」，聲阴本年度　租，以土地法寫一言十條規定，織攤法定地價和政府公佈的確定標準地價（折合榖米）百分之八，繳解地租，此訊傳到業主方面後，竟引起極度反感，租潮事件，於是開端。</p>
<p>當土地法頒佈之始，農會幹部已在醞釀實行計劃，迨七月六日颱風襲縣，全縣被災面積五七七二八·〇四畝，被災人數二三七二五人，却成爲此次租潮的導火綫。七月廿七日先有江南各鄉農民，鑒於此次風災慘重，屆此早榖收穫　租時期，擬廢除固定租　（三七五繳租），按照江北習慣，分鄉　租，聯名呈請縣府核示，經縣以「誠成搬　習慣辦理，法有規定，未便改易，徒起糾紛」而遭否決。接着，縣農會方面以各地晨民對於繳租意見各異，誠恐發生料紛，特於八月六日召集各鄉農會常務理事三十餘人，舉行聯席會議，共商統盤繳租辦法，經會商決定：「自本年度起，依照土地法第一百十條規定，解繳地價百分之八」，當場推定代表；計淸湖張運發，新駟高善芳，震浦陸茂棠，大　李良桂等十七人，由縣農會常務理事顧荆庸率領，於十一日向縣府請願後，即轉滬晋京，十二日到達首都，十三日分向行政院·社曾部·地政部·投呈請願，經行政院由李秘書接見，社會部由谷部長親自接見，地政部由湯次長吳司長等接見，對各代表　暑赴京，自動爲本身利益而奮鬥之精　，慰勉有加，並允　政飾例會討論，　請浙江省　府　　·十四日　　代表再赴杭向省社會處·省地政局·省農會請願。結果地政局洪局長表示接受，候令核辦。各代表等當於十六日返縣，請願後，一般佃晨，在靜候明令期間，除代業主繳預徵賦榖外，對於找租，則暫緩進行。</p>
<p>各業主經此打擊後，羣情惶惶，尤以各義莊·各學校·以及一般小資產者，薄置田產爲不安，爰亦於廿四日聯合駁正，發表文告。同時，並推定代表，向省請願，擁護二五减租辦決，以與佃農對抗。</p>
<p>關於佃業于雙方繳租糾紛事件，似已由沉寂而進入嚴重階段，浙省陳主席，因該項公事未到，未作具體表示，惟表明態度，省府決减輕佃農負擔，但地主應有權益，則予保護，在上項二原　下，想此一事件當能在佃戶　主雙方兼臘中，迅連廈利解決。</p>

<p>（續昨日第二版）</p>
<p>請願經過</p>
<p>（二）請願之經過：（一）參議會之請願：七月五日上午七時，平市東北學生由各處紛至中南海門前集合，至八時餘，約十餘單位學生四千餘名，蜂擁衝入北平市參議會內，以磚石木棒搗毀辦公室及宿舍，並呼一反飢餓」「反迫害」「打死參議員」等口號，貼標語，以疊羅漢方法爬上門楣，將北平市參議會門額改爲「土豪劣紳會」「三老四少會」，並有北平學聯學生數十人，高舉綠色紅字之「要生存」「要自由」之旗幟，向東北學生慰勞，作煽惑之講演，歡迎東北學生參加學聯，並搗毀「平市戡亂建國動員委負會」與「平市民衆淸共委負會」（此二機構均與市參議會在一樓中），負工及維持秩序之警憲略受微傷，此時學生席坐馬路中，要求該會員責人出面答覆，但無人接見，十一時有臨大主任陳克孚及教授一人向學生勸導靜候合理解決，亦未生效，學生等又闖入參議會，再事搗毀，憲兵十九團團長梅慶嵐被擊眼鏡破碎，經警察勸阻始得退出，遂又結隊向北長街李副總統官邸而去。（二）李副總統官邸之請願，十二時許，學生大隊到北長街李副總統門前，派代表晋謁副總統請願，適副總統在居仁堂開會，移時步行歸來，對代表答復，大略謂：一，建議政府加强臨太臨中，不論公以學院學生，都有讀書機會；二，收容及救濟問題，與地方機關商討，暫在自衛特捐項下墊撥，原則上已無問題；三，市參議會根據事實發表聲明。經學生要求命市參議會向學生道歉，副總統當答以市參議會爲民意代表，本人不能支配等語。學生認爲不滿，又有提議赴許惠東宅請願者，遂又結隊呼號，向東交民巷而去。（三）許惠東宅之請願：當日十四時許，徒手警察二百餘人，憲兵一排，有二十餘人帶槍者，均已到東交民巷東口一號許宅門內佈防戒嚴，少時學生代表三人先到，聲稱要求見許議長或負責之參議員向學生答覆，許未接見，學生大隊跑步到一號門前，向門內直衝，經警憲在門內阻擋，大門被擠裂，憲兵見情勢緊急，乃向空嗚槍，學生稍退，內七分局局員張乃仁因勸阻，被學生羣衆以磚擊傷頭部，昏厥於地，經救護送入醫院，其佩帶之手槍亦於當塲遺失，（翌日方由學生王大有手中取回，失去子彈一粒）學生旣不得入正門，遂在一號之圍墻東南角，拆毀一入口闖入，以磚石亂擲憲警，嗣經憲兵對空嗚槍，始又退去，學生分爲兩部份，集於門之東西，席坐地上，呌囂不已，雙方僵特至五時許，二零八師搜索營營長趙昌言，奉警備總部命令，率部隊兩連到達，不久快速部隊裝甲車開來四輛，停於一號門前兩輛，門西兩輛，搜紫營兵士佈防一號門前東西，警戒哨兵持有衝鋒槍輕機槍，分向東西，槍口指向學生羣中，斯時學生推代表十八人入院內，與憲警交涉，當經規塲指押官警察局副局長白世維告以明日負責答覆，並要求學生代表代爲淸查張局員失落手槍，如今日不能查得，明日亦可，並謂：已奉陳總司令命令，於七時宣佈戒嚴，勸學生暫時回去，一切明日解決，學生亦因飢渴，疲勞過度，允即散去，此時學生　集東部者在牌樓外，西部者在一號門以西，相距約六十餘公尺，中間爲裝甲車與搜索營士兵佈防。</p>
<p>事件發生</p>
<p>（三）事件發生之當時情形：七時餘，白副局長出門西往，向學生勸導歸去，學生多起立整隊之際，忽聘槍聲一響，由東傳來，旋即槍聲大作，約三分鐘，稍停，嗣槍聲又響一二分鐘，白副局長頓足大呼不准開槍，但無人理會，此時學生間提一發，即行伏地，槍停之後，由保懲隊陳大隊長偕同二零八師搜索營連長出門制止時，然已死傷多人矣，計當塲在東部牌樓外北便通上，死學生吳肇泰，韓德林二名，馬路左側靠便道，死孫德馨一名，在各醫院因傷身死者計楊龍，卜鴻勳，李福維，徐國昌，賀守志等五名，傷者十九名外，死市民張鳳嶺一名，事件發生後，傷者抬送醫院診治，死者候法院勘騐，八時許學生兵士俱行撤退，此七五事件前後之情形也。（未完，待續）。</p>

<p>（一）兌換及登記人民所有金銀外幣，爲游資開闢正當道路。（二）政府對進口貨中之原料品，及生產工具，要免收進口稅，及國營交通事業運輸費，以减低成本。（三）取得香港政府合作，根絕走私及資金逃港現象，同時便利華僑匯款，以吸收外匯。（四）國營事業不能漲價。（五）壓低利息至相當限度。</p>
<p>黃氏繼稱：善於運用美援，整理稅收，發行公債，使財政收支保持平衡，如此則可安定物價，經濟改革前途，必可樂觀。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕轍管會昨發表，上週出口貨品國外市况，及結匯情形如下：</p>
<p>本週（八月十六日至廿一日）上半週，國內盛傳新經濟方案即將實施，各業多觀望遼巡，物價各有升沉。出口貨品一般仍呈灑勢，其指數較上週約增百分之二十五，國外市况，除鴨毛·芝蔴·菜籽·棉籽餅等略漲，及大豆·闊豆·植物油等下跌外，其餘一般尚稱平穩。以週初國內外行市計算，上海及漢口豬鬃·羽毛·腸衣·蛋品·生皮·茶葉·五棓子·等外銷均獲利，但桐油·天津豬鬃·豆籽·食油·生絲·中藥·等略有虧差。損失最大者爲天津五十五號長鬃，差價達百分之四十二。週五，政府明令公佈幣制改革後，出口業已有良好反應，蓋金元與美元間匯率，業經硬性規定爲四與一之比，差價變異，可望消除。茲將本週出口貨品國外市况，略述於次：</p>
<p>桐油週初國外價格，F．O．B每磅仍為美金一角七分又四分之一，因國內市價上漲百分之廿五，故差價損失增爲百分之廿四，週末倫敦來電，英國進口商買價，每噸散裝一四六鎊，桶裝一五四鎊，本週出口桐油仍不踴躍，運港不少，因港存貨足，價格看跌之故。近據傳美國專家，又發現桐油新用途，能建造機塲，則桐油在軍事工業上比重將見增高，今後行情或可望好。</p>
<p>豬鬃漢口十七號，上海十七號，天津長五十五號，短五十五號，廿六號，每磅F．O．B．價格，依次爲美金四·七〇元，二·三〇元，七·〇〇，六·三五元，及四·九五元｛依週初結匯證價計算，上海漢口各號鬃，分別可獲利百分之十三及百分之五十四，天津各號爨則虧損。</p>
<p>茶葉到貨仍稀，暢銷北菲之珍眉等綠茶，洋商已可望加價，市况稍好轉，週初祁門紅茶及屯溪綠茶，每磅E．O．B．價格各爲美金二角五分及三角，外銷均可獲利，後者且超過一成，惟存底空處，交易不多。</p>
<p>生絲國外價格無變化，D級生絲上海F．O．B．每磅二·八〇美元。據甫自歐洲返國之蠶絲權威人士稱：由於絲織業生產能力不足，歐洲生絲價格，已自戰後之每磅一一美元逐跌至二·六美元，此項價格，顯屬過低，今後或有暴漲可能。現經國際生絲會議努力，今後生絲產量，將與存絲量及消費黃配合，以兼顧生絲商及絲織商之利益，其價格今後自當較目下情形轉好。且以生絲尚具有多種優良特性，仍將保持生絲在國際市塲之地位云。</p>
<p>羽毛中之鴨毛，國外價格轉秀，本週F．O．B．每磅價〇·四三五美元，O．I．F．則爲〇·四五美元，鵝毛價格每磅F．O．B．仍爲〇·五三五美元，外銷均有利，差價分別爲百分之三十五與百分之十六。</p>
<p>腸衣國外市價不變，F．O．B．七五美元，外銷獲利達百分之二十七，聞紐約腸衣售價低落，原銷該地之廿七碼裝成品已停止生產，改裝十三碼半裝運瑞士外銷。</p>
<p>豆類行市，國外下跌，漢口黃豆港價每担四〇港元，聞仍有競銷等情事。食油國外價格亦跌，廣州出口油，以港價連續報低，市塲呆疲。週末倫敦電訊，桶裝菜籽油C＆F每噸賣價一三五磅，油籽國外略漲，週末倫敦花生，大陸進口商買價爲C＆F每頓二九五美元。</p>
<p>紗布國外行市平穩，週初四十二支藍鳳，港價每條二〇二〇港元，上等棉布每疋一〇·五美元，外銷勉敷成本。至於棉布外銷數量，六七月份已逾二十萬疋，近以荷蘭當局，開放印尼區域若千港口，棉布在該區市塲，可望發展云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市公私立中小學收費標準業經決定如下：（一）私校部份：小學二十至三十金圓，初中三十五至五十金圓，高中四十五至六十金圓。該項標唯包括學雜費，由各校就此限度內酌斟環境自行訂定收費數字。（二）市校部份：國民學校十二金圓，初中二十一金圓，高中二十五金圓，以上均包括學費，雜費，教師進修費，體育費，修建費等在內。（國民學校不收學費。）</p>
<p>市教育局爲本學期收費問題，曾於日前分別約集公私立中小學校長舉行會談，聽取意見。昨日下午三時，吳市長於市府會議室，覆親自邀集有關各教育團體舉行座談會商談學費問題，出席市教育會，私立中小學聯合會，私立中教職指聯誼會，市中教職員聯誼會，市小校長聯誼會，市小教職員聯誼會，私小教職員聯誼會等單位代表四十餘人。敎局李代局長亦出席參加。</p>
<p>私校部份</p>
<p>首討論私校收費部份，各私校校長所提之數額爲小學三十至四十金圓，初中五十至六十金圓，高中七十至八十金圓，教局認爲應核减爲小學二十至二十五金圓，初中三十五至四十五金圓，高中四十五至五十五金圓。吳市長依私校教只待遇與市校同之原則推算後，認爲教局所根之數可以過去。各校長則向市長申辯力爭，市長稱：目前時勢不好，人民負担力差，如收費欲恢復戰前標準，實不可能。今日將收　標準定得低，各校雖維持困難，但如定得太高，必受社會輿論指責。市府祗能委曲求全，力求其平，使學校能安定，教師生活可維持，而人民亦能負担。南洋模範校長沈同一即向市長表示，如學校依教局所提標準收費，不能維持時將如何辦？市長當回答以　請校董會設法彌補經費。各校如欲另外增加教師待遇，亦當請董事會撥助，不能就學費上增收。並謂「你們可不顧到市民負担，市政府則必須顧到一。爭辯良久，最後市長接受市教育會周斐成之建議，將距離額放寬，決定小學爲二十至三十金圓，初中三十五至五十金圓，高中四十五至六十金圓。</p>
<p>市校部份</p>
<p>繼討論市校收費部份，出席之私校代表均退席。市校校長要求國民學校收十八·七金圓，初中收二十八金圓，高中收三十二金圓。教局認爲根據上期收費及物價比例，國民學校應收十一金圓，初中收二十一金圓，高中收二十五金圓。最後經商討決定國民學校收十二金圓，（內教師進修費六金圓，體育費一金圓，維費二金圓，修建費三金圓。）初中收二十一金圓，（內教師進修費十金圓，學費一金圓，其他體育費·雜費·修建費共十金圓，其分配比例待校畏開會商定。）高中收二十五金圓。（內教師進修費十二金圓，學費一金圓，其他體育費雜費修建費共十二金圓，其分配比例待校長商定。）</p>

<h3 id="c137">從述酒看陶潛 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 馬彬</p>
<p>陶淵明著作之紀時，入宋以後，但題甲子而不書年號，對故國　　忠懷，久矣爲人所盛道；這發現，初臘於十文選五臣注云：「淵明詩晋所作者，皆題年號，入宋所作，但題甲子而已。意者恥事二姓，故以異之。」</p>
<p>惟淵明以甲子紀時，初不於宋始，義熙以前，亦間有祗題甲子者，劉宋以後，則盡去年號矣。此雖係小節，但可以看出陶氏對當時一幕醜惡的禪讓戲之態度。</p>
<p>其賞，陶潛對晋室積弱，早就看出了覆亡的命運，且軍閥秉國，劉裕桓玄輩　縱狂妄，復興的希望已經滅絕；故淵明本身早就有「羨萬物之得時，感吾生之行休」的慨嘆。他這種隱憂，作品中頗多表白，惜前人不甚注意耳。如殷景仁往依劉裕爲參軍（時劉尚爲太尉），淵明在送行詩中，即有「良才不隱世，江湖多賤貧」的話，可見其平日牢騷，正復不淺！</p>
<p>陶潛對劉裕纂晋最具體的反映，莫過於述酒一詩，是篇雖借酒以亂眞，但仔細讀去，部可以看他內心的憤鬱，可以看出他對晋室不能或忘的感情。現在把它抄在下面：</p>
<p>「重離照南陸，鳴烏聲相聞，秋草雖未黃，融風久已分，素礫晶脩渚，南嶽無餘雲。豫章抗商門，重華固靈墳；流淚抱中嘆，傾耳聽司晨。神州獻嘉粟，西靈爲我訓，諸梁董師旅，芋勝喪其身。山陽歸下國，成名猶不勤，卜生善斯牧，安樂不爲君。平王去舊京，峽中納遺黨，雙陵甫云育，三趾顯奇文。王子愛淸吹，日中翔河汾。朱公練九齒，閑居離世紛。峨峨西嶺內，偃息常所親。天容自永固，彭觴非等論。」</p>
<p>此詩開頭一段，流連景光之品，初無足異，但到「豫章抗高門，重華間靈墳」兩句，譴責恭帝揖遜，　氣有如江河之泛濫，一發而不可過制矣。</p>
<p>史載：劉裕　晋後，廢恭帝爲零陵王，明年，以毒酒授張偉使　殺，偉不忍故君之難，自飲酖而卒；裕復遣兵進酖，恭帝拒之，遂遭掩殺。</p>
<p>湯東澗曾謂淵明「述酒」一篇爲恭帝之哀詩，當是無訛，詩中「山陽歸下國」，自係借漢獻帝故事以喻時事，且漢獻與晋恭命運完全相似，曹魏篡漢後，降獻帝爲山陽公，卒弒之，劉裕對待恭帝，即襲用了曹丕的手法。歷史的循環悲劇，使一介書生的陶淵明，只有「流淚抱中嘆」了。</p>
<p>黃山谷曾對「述酒」之命題存疑，但如知道了上面的故事，即可明瞭「述酒」的「酒」，當是酖恭帝的毒酒，與「儀狄造，杜康潤色之」是了無關係，而且淵明想這樣一個題目，也着實費了一番苦心的！</p>
<p>淵明生於亂世，身爲破落之世家子，其感慨自較人爲深，然亂離之世，艱於爲言，尤其朝代更替之際，要發牢騷，往往不得保其首領而歿，魏晋之交，殘害文士，似是統治者賞心樂意之作，陶潛生長於斯，安得不戒愼恐懼。故在他作品中，有時隱諱得厲害，也惟其隱諱，偶觸衷情，惜有沉哀，如「木欣欣以向　系涓涓而始流」，如「刑天　　威，猛志固常在」，如「跋桑長江邊……忽　山河改」及不侫上引述酒　殷　安別等等，處處都可以看陶氏內心生活與他外表正有着極猛烈的　突。然而淵明的長處是能把這種矛盾調和，他受老莊的哲學陶冶甚深，故得失之懷較淡，譬如晋亡之後，淵明有傷悼沉痛之感如「述酒」者，但他却壓抑住了，因知本身沒有招兵買馬的力量，空頭的高潔表白，自可不必。譬如陶氏與高僧慧遠交契之深，一時無二，但淵明始終未入白連社，可知他於亂離之中，祗想有所不爲而獨善其身了。</p>
<p>當此變亂頻仍之世，每念淵明高舉遠蹈，不受世紛，反觀今日，放僻邪侈，無所不爲者正大有人在，益覺獨善其身之可珍貴也。</p>

<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>余兄微明日前自台灣歸來，談及彼處人民學太極拳情形，有一記之價值。</p>
<p>日本人佔據台灣有五十年之久，其本國人有柔道之練習，而禁止台灣人鍛練身體，不許有武術團社之組織。勝利後，合灣濱海新竹市有謝鏡湖者，爲微明弟子，在鄭氏祠堂設一太極拳社，從之學者有二十餘人。又有周敏益者，昔年特來上海從微明學拳，有五六年。兩人來函約微明往台省一游，匯寄一億數千萬元爲川資，微明於六月二十四日飛台。到新竹時，周謝二君開會歡迎，先期在台灣新生報登有一上海太極拳大師陳微明來台」消息。在歡迎會中，聞風而來觀者約二百餘人，先由謝鏡湖之學生表演，再由陳鐸鳴演太極拳，徐文甫演少林拳，太極劍，雙刀，（兩人爲微明高足弟子，同時飛台者。）極爲精彩。微明兄演太極長拳，八卦掌，又與鐸明動步推手，乃台人所未嘗見者，拍掌不絕。來賓有練外家拳者，亦請出表演，表演旣畢，入內休息，而來參觀者不散，某拳家請求比手，微明出來對衆言：「余此來純爲游覽，非來比賽者，如定要比手，不妨研究研究。」某君即上前，身體結壯，微明出右手比一勢，並未擊之，某君猛然抓住微明右臂，欲拖動跌之，其力極大，微明隨行數步，某君之力已悄滅，繼以左手微點其眼部，微示以意而已，然某君不知內家拳之竅妙，仍緊執微明右臂不放，微明將右臂略一抖動，此人受震，後退七八步，幾至倒下，來觀之衆人始服，拍手而散。經過此會不久，微明國術大師之名，喧傳於台灣各地。合北有人寫信請微明去教拳，微明以欲回滬，時間不及謝絕之。</p>
<p>微明於民十四年在上海創設致柔拳社，爲南方提倡太極拳之最早者，現仍存在，社址在西藏路甯波同鄉會中。二十餘年來，　之學太極筆者極衆，如名人　　，許世英，及已故之謝特，伍朝　，黃郛，胡樸安，關絅之諸人，均爲其弟子。民二十一年李宗仁白崇禧兩將軍特請其至廣西教拳，廣西人之知有太極拳，自徵明提倡始。今又與台灣人以太極拳之新印象，不可不一記。</p>

<p>二十五年之後，波蘭人在勞慈地方舉行一次盛大的公開招待會歡迎來訪的胡佛，那時配德留斯基已被選爲波蘭的總統，他在會中感謝美國人在胡佛的救濟工作之下拯救了無數波蘭人的生命。胡佛在答謝辭中却說：他僅不過是償還一筆四百元美金的舊債而已</p>

<h3 id="e1">The President Inquires About Shanghai's Financial Situation; The Executive Yuan Simultaneously Invites Responsible Parties for Talks, Encouraging Them to Make Earnest Efforts to Assist Production <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] At 4 PM on the 28th, the President received Qian Xin-zhi, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Communications, at his official residence. He inquired about the financial situation in Shanghai after the currency reform and listened to Mr. Qian's opinions. Mr. Qian offered the President three suggestions: (1) The currency reform was a timely measure, although it was felt to be somewhat late. The response after the reform has been excellent, and it is hoped that the government can strengthen its implementation with the greatest determination. It is also hoped that the government will replenish the reserve for issuance, and that the assets of state-owned enterprises will be converted into negotiable securities by issuing stocks as soon as possible. (2) After the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates, the people have exchanged gold, silver, and foreign currencies for Gold Yuan Certificates, and the floating capital in the market has in fact increased compared to before. It is hoped that the government can use effective measures to guide this increased floating capital into proper channels, so as not to stimulate prices. (3) Stabilizing prices to promote industrial production. The President agreed with these points. The conversation lasted one hour before Mr. Qian took his leave.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] At 3:30 PM on the 28th, Premier Weng Wen-hao of the Executive Yuan convened a meeting at the Yuan, inviting the heads of commercial banks, business leaders, and representatives from the Bankers' Association and the Silver Industry Association for discussions. Those present included Xu Ji-qing, Li Fu-sun, Qin Run-qing (represented by Shen Ri-xin), Chen Guangfu (represented by Wu Kejia), Du Yue-sheng, Song Zi-liang, Chuan Mu-bo, Yu Zuo-ting, Wang Meng-shu, Xu Guo-mao, Tan Gong-yuan, Wang Shao-xian, Zai Ming-li, Wang Zhi-xin, Rao Tao-shu, and more than ten others. Minister of Finance Wang Yun-wu and Vice Minister of Finance Xu Bai-yuan also participated. The meeting lasted for about two hours. At the beginning of the meeting, Premier Weng and Minister Wang explained the significance of convening the meeting, which was to review the financial and economic measures taken over the past week. Premier Weng first expressed his appreciation to the financial community for faithfully implementing national policies over the past week, and then gave instructions on lowering market interest rates for all banks, assisting production enterprises, depositing foreign exchange reserves, and facilitating domestic remittances, encouraging them to continue their earnest efforts. He also expressed hope that the Shanghai business and financial leaders would cooperate effectively with the government to ensure that the emergency financial and economic measures could be thoroughly implemented. After the opening remarks by Premier Weng and Minister Wang, Li Fu-sun and Xu Ji-qing spoke, explaining how the Shanghai business community had complied with the government's emergency financial and economic measures and the instructions given by the President during the previous meeting. They also expressed their firm commitment to supporting the government's unfulfilled policies and continuing to promote them. Subsequently, Du Yue-sheng, Wang Zhi-xin, Yu Zuo-ting, and others spoke in succession, offering suggestions. The main points of their suggestions were: (1) They hoped that bank interest rates could be gradually lowered, rather than being rigidly stipulated. They felt that the proposed reductions to within one cent after September 1st and within five points after September 16th were too low, which would affect the survival of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises and create a situation where funds would not be lent out. (2) They hoped that the capital increases for banks would not be too high, and that completing the capital increases within two months was too short of a time limit. They expressed that increasing the capital of Shanghai banks to one million Gold Yuan Certificates was beyond the capacity of most banks. (3) They hoped that the stock exchange, which had been ordered to suspend operations, would be restored in the near future. (4) The Legislative Yuan is discussing the acquisition of commercial shares in the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank. They hoped that the government could reconsider. If the government believes that the directors and supervisors of commercial shares in these banks are not entirely suitable, they can be replaced, but they do not support the central government's acquisition of commercial shares. Regarding the deposit of foreign exchange reserves with the Central Bank, they expressed their willingness to cooperate with the government, deposit as much as possible, and convene a meeting of the heads of banks and commercial banks in Shanghai within eleven days to discuss the technical issues of the deposit. Finally, Premier Weng concluded by saying that he had personally recorded the opinions of the Shanghai financial community and would keep them for future reference.

<p>Board Meeting of the Four Joint Offices</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Four Joint Offices held its 370th board meeting on the morning of the 28th, chaired by Premier Weng Wen-hao. The directors present were Wang Yun-wu, Chen Qi-tian, Liu Gong-yun, Song Han-zhang, Qian Xin-zhi, and Secretary-General Xu Bai-yuan. First, the Secretariat reported on the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures and the reactions in various regions, generally indicating a stabilizing trend. Subsequently, the heads of various banks and treasuries reported on the general business conditions after the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates. They expressed optimism about the work of collecting gold, silver, and foreign currencies. According to the reports received as of the 26th, a total of over 10,170 market taels of gold, over 200,530 market taels of silver, over 906,200 silver dollars, over 5.15 million US dollars, and over 9.2 million Hong Kong dollars have been collected, totaling approximately US$12 million. In the future, various banks and treasuries will further improve the collection techniques to facilitate customers. Premier Weng then instructed that the economic reform has achieved initial success. In the future, for stabilizing the market, adjusting supply and demand, strictly prohibiting speculation, cracking down on the black market, channeling funds, and assisting production, close coordination should be planned to accelerate the completion of the reform policies. Following this, proposals were discussed.</p>
<p>1.  Regarding how to formulate the lending policy in the future, three points were decided in principle.</p>
<p>(1) The general budget for the second half of the year should be revised according to the Gold Yuan unit. Various agencies should use the funds in installments in accordance with the provisions of the Public Treasury Law. All loans secured by the budget should be stopped.</p>
<p>(2) Market interest rates should be gradually reduced. The original differential interest rate standard should be abolished. Loans that have not yet matured should be calculated according to the new method from the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>(3) With price stability and the gradual normalization of production and sales, the original ordering loans and entrusted production methods should no longer be applicable. Procurement may be carried out when necessary.</p>
<p>As for the lending targets, scope, loan review procedures, and post-loan assessments, how to redefine them will be discussed by a special project team and then submitted for review.</p>
<p>2.  Domestic remittance rates should be gradually leveled, and various banks and bureaus should handle them in accordance with the following principles.</p>
<p>(1) Various banks and bureaus should charge low fees for remittances, and the Central Bank should allocate funds at any time.</p>
<p>(2) When handling remittances, banks and bureaus should still strictly verify the name, address, and purpose of the remittance in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>3.  Revise the Provisional Rules for Interbank Rediscounting by the Rediscount Committee of the Central Bank (full text on the left corner).</p>

<p>Claims that if the Economic Reform Plan Fails, the Entire Nation Will Suffer a Major Disaster</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Zhang Li-sheng and Wang Fu-zhou went to Tianjin at 8 AM on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 28th] Zhang Li-sheng and Wang Fu-zhou arrived in Tianjin on the 28th. During the conversation, Mr. Zhang emphasized that the general public has already exchanged all their gold and silver notes for Gold Yuan Certificates, which is truly moving. He especially hopes that banks, money houses, companies, and stores that have gold, silver, and foreign currencies will also actively contribute them. He pointed out that this is not a loss, but if the economic reform plan fails, the entire nation will suffer a major economic crisis. Regarding stabilizing prices, Mr. Zhang said that the government will comprehensively study the transportation and sales costs of various goods to restore prices to a normal state. Although the current price limits cannot be said to be short-term, they cannot be said to be frozen for a long time. Regarding the issue of capital inflow to the Northeast, he said that Director Wang Fu-zhou will study and resolve the issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] According to Director Wang Fu-zhou, the government has several thousand tons of nickel coins in storage from the war, which are being distributed to various places to meet the needs. In addition, silver and copper coins are being produced in large quantities.</p>

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The sorghum in the Northeast is ripening, and the authorities attach great importance to the autumn harvest. Provincial, city, and county governments have decided to immediately establish People's Self-Defense Committees to strengthen economic warfare, protect the land, and harvest grain. The commanders of the garrison troops in each county will serve concurrently as the chairmen of the Self-Defense Committees. Wang Tie-han, Chairman of Liaoning Province, and Dong Wen-qi, Mayor of Shenyang, will also serve concurrently as the chairmen of the People's Self-Defense Committees. Moreover, with the autumn harvest approaching, bandits in the Jilin and Liaobei areas are organizing "Grain-Snatching Guerrilla Teams" to widely roam and seize grain.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Political Affairs Committee of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters on September 1st</p>
<p>[Our Pan-yang Dispatch, 28th] It is reported that the Political Affairs Committee of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters in the Northeast has received an order from the Executive Yuan to reorganize its new establishment on September 1st. The Political Affairs Committee will have one chairman, fourteen appointed members, and one secretary-general. It will have four departments: political affairs, economy, culture and education, and land. There will be five to seven appointed inspection commissioners. The committee is currently considering technical issues related to the reorganization. Due to the special environment in the Northeast, the organization may be slightly larger than stipulated. Reorganization is inevitable. The laid-off personnel will be properly resettled so they do not lose their jobs.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Four Committees of the Control Yuan Hold a Meeting; Discuss Raising the Salaries of Public Servants and Teachers; Decided to Transfer to the Finance Committee for Discussion <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Economic, Resources, Agricultural and Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committees of the Control Yuan held a meeting on the morning of the 28th to discuss Chai Feng's proposal, "Please Correct the Government's Decision to Raise the Salaries of Public Servants and Teachers According to Pre-War Standards." The participating committee members spoke one after another, and most of them believed that it was necessary to draw the government's attention to the issue of the treatment of public servants and teachers. However, whether it is necessary to propose a correction案 is still under study. It was decided to transfer it to the Finance Committee of the Yuan for further discussion. The main contents of the case are as follows: "The government's tax revenue and the fees of state-owned enterprises will be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards. However, the treatment of public servants and teachers still follows the old system and is far from pre-war standards. However, finance and economy are related to the entire politics. If we want political integrity, it is necessary to: (1) Eliminate corruption, (2) Improve efficiency. However, to achieve these two, it is necessary to improve the treatment of civil and military public servants and teachers. According to the new system, the treatment of public servants and teachers is paid in Gold Yuan, but this Gold Yuan is only half of the pre-war silver dollar, which has been effectively halved. The standard in the Beijing-Shanghai area is based on the original salary of 40 yuan for the Gold Yuan, but in reality, only 20 yuan of the pre-war silver dollar is obtained. If the original salary is 800 yuan, it can get 142 Gold Yuan, which is 71 silver dollars, less than one-tenth of the pre-war. Senior executives may be able to use their powers to obtain subsidies. Therefore, in order to eliminate corruption and improve efficiency, the treatment of public servants and teachers under the new currency system must be free from additional subsidies, and should be increased together with pre-war tax revenue standards, without any discounts.</p>

<p>Jiang Jingguo Has Also Focused on This</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Before the announcement of the Emergency Economic Measures, a certain anonymous person who went to Shanghai to speculate and made windfall profits has attracted a lot of attention. The Control Yuan also exchanged views on this in the small group committee on the morning of the 28th, believing that it should be investigated. However, no decision was made. It is also learned that Jiang Jingguo, who is stationed in Shanghai to supervise the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures, has recently focused on this, and some people are pinning their hopes on Mr. Jiang's major measures.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Salaries of Civil and Military Personnel; Regional Payment Standards; The Executive Yuan Stipulates Implementation This Month <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Executive Yuan has decided on the regional payment standards for the salaries of civil and military personnel, stipulating that they will be implemented from August and paid in Gold Yuan Certificates. The standard is based on the Beijing-Shanghai area, with 40 yuan as the base. For those with a base salary exceeding 40 yuan up to 300 yuan, the excess amount is calculated at 20%. Those exceeding 300 yuan are calculated at 10%. For areas outside the Beijing-Shanghai area, if prices are lower than the Beijing-Shanghai area, the payment will be reduced accordingly. If prices are higher, the payment will be increased accordingly. The percentage of increase or decrease is calculated based on the tax amount. For example, in Chongqing, the reduction is 20% according to the regulations. If the total amount is 100 Gold Yuan according to the original standard, the actual amount received is 80 yuan due to the 20% deduction. In Shenyang, according to the regulations, 200% is added. Those who can receive 100 Gold Yuan per month according to the Beijing-Shanghai area standard will receive 300 Gold Yuan after the increase. The districts and applicable areas are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e14">Compassionate Intentions and the Resolution to Eliminate Evil <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>—A few words to university professors and authorities about clearing out professional students—</p>
<p>During the implementation of currency reform and economic stabilization measures, another important government measure is to actively eliminate Communist spies lurking in society, including the investigation and crackdown on professional students who lead student movements. Three days before the Emergency Economic Measures Order, the Executive Yuan ordered local security authorities to implement four measures, one of which was to strictly prohibit students from engaging in strikes, demonstrations, incitement, and other behaviors intended to obstruct the suppression of rebellion, and designated that such offenders be handled by special criminal courts. In his speech on the 22nd, the President, in addition to economic measures, specifically reiterated his determination to crack down on the Communist Party disrupting schools. In the past ten days, security authorities in the capital and other cities such as Pingjin, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have taken actions to assist in the implementation of this order, and special criminal courts are also summoning people for questioning according to law. We cherish education and have repeatedly written articles urging university teachers and students to automatically sanction students who disrupt schools. Now that the situation is slightly different, we would like to say a few more words to university presidents and professors, and provide some suggestions to the authorities responsible for carrying out this task.</p>
<p>First, we must point out that it is a tragedy of the times that these young people who have received higher education cannot be persuaded by reason and instead are exploited by the Communist Party, or are unknowingly manipulated by them without realizing it, ultimately facing sanctions under national law, or being convicted and punished due to conclusive evidence, or taking risks and fleeing to Communist-controlled areas. But at the same time, we must also point out that the thorough elimination of Communist spies, including important figures active in universities, is as important as economic reform, meets the needs of the times and public opinion, and is also a government responsibility that cannot be "tolerated again." This matter must be done thoroughly in order to restore stability to universities; like the reform of the currency system, this major undertaking can only succeed and must not fail.</p>
<p>We believe that eliminating the troublemakers among students is something that meets the demands of public opinion. Because now, unless someone is blindly acting as an outer member of the Communist Party, no one can deny that the large-scale student movements in recent years have been led by a core of Communist professional students. Just by looking back, we can all remember that university student strikes, demonstrations, and other behaviors have increased since the Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion Order last May. The more tense the military situation in the suppression of the Communist Party, the more frequent, widespread, and violent these destructive student movements became. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, there were 96 student movements in this academic year, with a loss of 506 days of study time. Especially since April and May of this year, their incitement activities have become more violent, and the student masses clearly understand that all student movements are led and controlled by Communist Party infiltrators. Scientists, professors, and presidents of universities often distrust the government's warnings and have long been deceived and manipulated by them. Now, they also painfully feel that the level of students is declining day by day, and the sympathy of society is increasingly being lost. They have gradually realized that the source of all unrest lies in the lurking Communist spies, whose behavior is no longer tolerable. The most heartbroken are, of course, the students' parents, who see the tuition fees provided with their sweat and blood being wasted as if thrown away, leading to excessive tolerance on the part of the schools and the government. Therefore, just as the depreciation of the legal tender has reached its limit and is deeply criticized by the people, the disturbance and rampant behavior of professional students in schools has also reached a point that society cannot tolerate.</p>
<p>The government's relatively mild and tolerant attitude towards students who cause trouble is not only due to the psychology of "fear of hurting the vase when trying to catch the mouse," but also due to excessive respect for the status of scholars and professors, originally hoping that their education would solve the internal affairs of the schools themselves. However, facts have proven that this is not possible, and today it is necessary to take pressure to eliminate them. As for authorizing special judicial institutions to handle this matter, it can be said to be an extremely last resort. We have already mentioned that cracking down on student movements in this way is a sad thing for China today, but on the other hand, we must remind the principals and professors that this is something that must be done for the sake of the country and the future of education, and that everyone must work together to do it.</p>
<p>The facts are very clear, but we are still saying this again today because experts and professors specialize in their fields and are often "easily deceived by those who know their ways," or they overestimate their own status and the importance of their fields. Moreover, some young lecturers and professors are even moved by the inflammatory instigation, shifting their dissatisfaction with the current situation to any action by the government, and thus may become an obstacle to the government's implementation. At present, the response of the presidents of various well-known universities is very fair: President Hu Shi of Peking University mentioned that university students are not people in concessions, Acting President Wang of Shanghai Jiaotong University said that the government is handling things according to law and that the school cannot protect illegal elements, and President Chen of Nanjing Jinling University said that "school education is not only cultivating young people, but also educating young people to respect the law." All of them can recognize that the government is handling things according to law and that students must comply, which can indeed show a fundamental meaning. However, we still deeply hope that the school authorities will take responsibility together, because it is all for the benefit of the school itself. The principals must still stand at the forefront and must not completely entrust the security and judicial organs to handle the matter without asking, and should not have an equal or biased mentality that would cover up the evil and cause harm. Principals and professors have more contact with students on weekdays and observe them more closely. Although it is said that some universities are too large, they are ultimately more attentive than the police's investigation. In order to restore the stability of the school, eliminating troublemakers is certainly important, but protecting the innocent so that there is no injustice is also necessary. Both of these require the school authorities to frankly provide materials and give the security authorities the assistance they should have in their implementation. Those young people who have been deeply poisoned and trained to deliberately sabotage really cannot be tolerated. The school must also have the determination to eliminate evil in order to protect the interests of pure students and the school. Secondly, we want to remind the local administrative and security organs that are implementing the Executive Yuan's orders that the Communist Party's "student movement" work in schools, especially in higher education, is a long-standing conspiracy, and now is the time to thoroughly eliminate Communist spies without tolerance. But here there is a most important prerequisite, that is, the government is taking this action to eliminate military obstacles and stabilize order, but another purpose is to truly cherish education and to restore the stability and progress of universities. Therefore, those who implement the orders must certainly have a psychology of security above all else, but they must also not ignore the standpoint of education and must not hurt the feelings of the school authorities and the majority of pure students. We have earnestly hoped that the security authorities will be responsible and also be prudent. The great statesmen of our ancestors treated crimes and punishments with what is called "compassionate intentions and no rejoicing," which is enough to represent the government's mood in eliminating Communist Party students today. Those in charge of security and special justice must understand this intention in order to be good at implementing this task. We are eliminating troublemakers in order to protect the right to study of the majority of good students; we are cracking down on reactionaries in order to preserve the higher education of the country. No matter how insulting the past behavior of the professional students towards the government's military and police, there must be no retaliatory psychology today, but must absolutely abide by the law. Simply put: the authorities enforcing security must have a firm stance, but their methods must be gentle; the methods can be decisive, but the attitude must still be peaceful. This will win the sympathy and cooperation of the school authorities and can achieve twice the result with half the effort; otherwise, disturbing the grass and alarming the snakes will cause many complications and will not be able to accomplish the task. As for the personnel in charge of the special criminal courts, they certainly have legal knowledge, but they must also have political demeanor. The list obtained from the investigation may not be completely reliable, so the summons must be meticulous, and the evidence must be complete, so as to ensure that there is no injustice. The school authorities may have cases of bias and tolerance, but if the special criminal court acts in a civilized and prudent manner, it will be able to obtain the assistance of the school under the current general situation. Using a compassionate mentality to assist the sense of responsibility in enforcing the law, then sincerity will be able to move people, and even young people with strong blood and energy will be able to calmly be convinced.</p>
<p>We also feel that the educational administrative authorities, at a time when this autumn semester has not yet started and the security and judicial organs are already implementing orders, must not only not relax their responsibilities, but must also stand up and take responsibility for making comprehensive and active plans to cooperate with this solemn task. In the Ministry of Education's attitude toward universities, only skillful coping is not allowed. If the methods are not unified, they are often investigated afterwards, and rarely eliminated in advance. Now that the government has risen to take responsibility, the Ministry of Education must not shirk its responsibility from now on, but must provide materials, provide methods, and assist the security authorities in various ways, in order to atone for its past failures to fulfill its responsibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to reiterate to university presidents, professors, and pure students who advocate reason: the government's determination and actions this time are not only a political necessity, but also the only way to ensure the safety of education. We must recognize that the Communist bandits' sabotage and rebellion have reached a point where they are absolutely opposed to the interests of education and the country. Today's actions are to eliminate traitors, not to "persecute" young people; they are to clear away obstacles to the country's survival, not to infringe on the freedom of schools; they are to drive away the demons that are anti-science and anti-education, not to destroy the dignity of academia and education. The government should certainly maintain a cautious and careful attitude, and university teachers and students must recognize the times, distinguish between benefits and harms, and cooperate in order to enable the authorities to fulfill their tasks well and restore the stability and progress of schools.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Two Convicted of Escorting Students to Communist Areas Sentenced to Ten Years' Imprisonment; Three Students from Central University Sentenced to Five and Six Years' Imprisonment Respectively <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei, students from Central University, and Communist liaison officers Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui, five people who planned to sneak into Communist areas to participate in rebellious work, were previously tried by the Capital Special Criminal Court, and the verdict was announced at 10:50 a.m. on the 28th. The main text of the judgment is as follows: "Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui jointly intended to undermine the national system and seize national territory, and continued to implement it, and shall be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights." "Zhu Chengxue jointly intended to undermine the national system and seize national territory, and prepared to implement it, and shall be sentenced to six years of imprisonment and six years of deprivation of civil rights." "Hua Binqing and Li Fei jointly intended to undermine the national system and seize national territory, and prepared to implement it, and shall each be sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights."</p>
<p>Chief Judge's Explanation</p>
<p>After the presiding judge announced the verdict, he also explained: Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui were working as traffic liaisons for the bandits and had repeatedly escorted students to Communist areas. They should have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Considering that they were workers with limited knowledge, although their crimes were heinous, they were ignorant and exploited, so they were given a lighter sentence, reduced to ten years of imprisonment. Zhu Chengxue and the other three originally acted together, but according to the confessions of Li Fei and Hua Binqing during the interrogation by the Police Department, it was Zhu Chengxue who invited them to go, which clearly shows that Zhu was the initiator, so Zhu was sentenced to one more year. According to the indictment, the crimes of the three should also be punishable by death or life imprisonment, but the circumstances of "contacting the Civil League to surround the Youth Department" are only suspected and there is no conclusive evidence, so only the "preparation to work in the Communist area of Chaoxian County" is based on Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Regulations for Punishing Crimes during the Suppression of Rebellion, which should be punishable by ten years of imprisonment. However, considering that you are university students and the state has spent money to cultivate you, we still have hope for you and will reduce the sentence by half again so as not to affect your future. In law, the sentence has been reduced as much as possible. As long as you abide by the law in the future, you can even be granted early parole. The court has considered this case carefully. If you are still dissatisfied, you can apply to the Central Special Criminal Court for a review within ten days of receiving the judgment." Zhu Chengxue and others seemed surprised by the lenient sentence, so they had expressions of surprise and realization, because before the judgment, Zhu and others frequently inquired whether they would be sentenced to death. Tao Yuangui seemed to be overwhelmed with repentance and asked the presiding judge to be merciful, saying that there was an old father at home with no one to support him and asked for a reduction in sentence. The presiding judge rebuked him, saying: "Your sentence has already been reduced, the judgment has been made, and you can be released early as long as you abide by the law in the future." At this point, the court ordered the five convicts to be escorted back and adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Chengdu Nickel Coin Frenzy Gradually Calms Down; Central Bank Branch Delays Announcement of Universal Telegraph Order; Industrial and Commercial Groups Jointly Telegraph Center to Investigate <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the Central Bank's corruption in the Chengdu nickel coin turmoil, the Chengdu newspapers unanimously reported on the 28th that Yang Xiaoci, the branch manager of the Central Bank, used his power to suppress the head office's telegraph order for universal use of nickel coins and secretly used a huge amount of 7 trillion legal tender to purchase nickel coins, making tens of trillions in profits, causing extreme chaos in the Chengdu market. Today, it has aroused resentment among the people of Chengdu, and public opinion is in an uproar. Industrial and commercial groups have jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate and severely punish them.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 27th] In this nickel coin turmoil, the Central Bank of Chengdu received a telegram on the 21st ordering universal use, but it was delayed until the 25th before it was announced. During this period, countless people made billions of profits by buying and selling nickel coins. The supervisory committee member stationed in Chengdu believes that the bank has major suspicions of corruption and embezzlement and has decided to formally file a report.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 28th] The huge waves in the market caused by the Chengdu nickel coin turmoil gradually calmed down on the 28th. Most of the shops have resumed business, and the city government has generally set price limits, with rice at 54 million yuan per double stone. However, most of the goods in the market have been snapped up, resulting in supply falling short of demand. The Provincial Federation of Commerce today telegraphed the President, requesting that the nickel coins be recalled and recast to prevent the harm of coins. The provincial government has decided to set hard price limits and prohibit hoarding, with severe penalties for violators.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Qingdao Arrests Gold Speculators; Rumors of a US Dollar Black Market Re-emerge; US Military to Exchange US Dollars for Gold Yuan for Payroll <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao, 27th] Since the currency reform, the US garrison in Qingdao will pay the Central Bank US$800,000 monthly to exchange for Gold Yuan to pay salaries to Chinese and foreign staff.  Excluding 30% that will flow back to the US, the government may acquire US$400,000 to $500,000 in foreign exchange. The annual amount is enough to cover the expenses of over 100 divisions of the National Army for one month.</p>
<p>In the past, US dollars were priced at nineteen "nan zha," therefore, over the past three years, of the millions of US dollars that flowed into the Qingdao market, it is normally estimated that about one million remain in Qingdao.  However, since the Central Bank began exchanging the new currency, the first day was exceptionally crowded, reaching 200,000 yuan. In subsequent days, it has not been able to break this record, and so far, it has not even reached 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, announced his full cooperation to completely eliminate the circulation of US dollars in Qingdao. On the day of the exchange, Major General Smith, Commander of the Marine Corps, and Captain Johnson, Chief of the Qingdao Harbor Service Department, specifically instructed their troops to be vigilant and informed their subordinates on how to save, deposit, and exchange US dollars through the military post office to send back home. Whether the circulation of US dollars can be completely eradicated will depend on the trend of price developments, especially on whether the US soldiers will disregard the orders of their superiors and still demand US dollars.</p>
<p>However, as a matter of fact, on the first day of the Gold Yuan's appearance, the US dollar black market can be said to have completely disappeared.  Places such as Weixian Road near the Central Bank, which used to be crowded and openly active, a phenomenon that could be called the only miracle in the country, suddenly vanished, like a desolate and silent battlefield after a fierce battle, leaving people to mourn.  But recently, rumors of a black market have resurfaced, and so-called "gold speculators" have been arrested one after another, reaching 250 people in the past three days.  These people have been operating in the black market for years, numbering over a thousand, but they merely rely on running around to search for and supply big clients and make small profits.  Therefore, the previously blatant public appearance was practically ignored by the government. On the one hand, it could be explained as impossible to catch them all, but on the other hand, it inevitably raises suspicions. The new mayor, Xi Xue, who is known as a capable person, visited the black market on the street after taking office and was shocked.  Within a few days, the currency reform was announced.  How to thoroughly investigate the big clients or even cooperate with the Sui District to decisively search private residences will depend on his planning and how he tackles the current difficulties.</p>
<p>Whether it will return to the old ways depends on the overall situation, which cannot be judged solely from Qingdao's perspective. However, the phenomenon in Qingdao can undoubtedly serve as an indicator for the future.</p>

<p>Shanghai Remittance Also Lower Than Official Rate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th] Hong Kong gold prices have been declining since the opening this morning, falling to 302.5 yuan per tael in Shanghai currency at noon. This is the lowest gold price since August 20th. After China's currency reform was announced on August 20th, gold bars fell 15 pounds, resulting in 317 Hong Kong dollars per tael. When trading opened today, gold was at 311 Hong Kong dollars per tael, but due to the large number of sellers, it fell by about 9 yuan, before rising slightly to 304.5 Hong Kong dollars per tael at the close of trading. Financial observers believe this is due to the decline in the US dollar exchange rate, which is now 5.04 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, compared to 5.22 on August 20th. Shanghai telegraphic transfers from banks here are 130 Hong Kong dollars for 100 Gold Yuan, and Guangzhou telegraphic transfers are 126 Hong Kong dollars for 100 Gold Yuan, both lower than the official exchange rate. The official rate is 133 Hong Kong dollars for 100 Gold Yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 28th Broadcast: According to highly reliable sources, the talks in Moscow on the Berlin issue have reached an agreement in principle. The technical details will be resolved by the military leaders in Berlin, and then sent back to Moscow for discussion in order to finalize an agreement to lift the blockade of Berlin. Other issues related to Germany and Europe will be discussed by the four-power foreign ministers in Paris.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast: The resignation of the French Marie cabinet has had a major impact on the four-power talks on the German question. The four-power communiqué, originally scheduled to be released tonight, has been temporarily postponed. There will be no meetings between the three-power ambassadors and the Soviet side for the next two days. The four-power talks on the German question could have concluded, but the resignation of the French cabinet will cause a standstill.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 28th Telegraph] After numerous Kremlin talks, the Soviet Union and the three Western powers have apparently reached some agreement on the Berlin issue. It is expected that a four-power joint communiqué will be released simultaneously in the four capitals on the evening of the 28th. It is reported that the Western envoys will decide when to release the communiqué and its contents when they review it in Moscow on the 28th. According to well-informed sources, some technical details still need to be resolved before the communiqué can be released. It is reported that the communiqué will definitely be brief and lacking in detail.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th Telegraph] According to well-informed American sources, the three Western power representatives proposed to Molotov today the establishment of a four-power standing financial committee to handle the issue of issuing East Marks in Berlin. As for the organization and powers of the committee, that side does not wish to continue making statements. In addition, the British Foreign Office announced that the French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, met with Bevan's chief advisor, Strang, this morning.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 27th Telegraph] Authoritative sources here have confirmed that the core of the issue lies in the Berlin currency system and the lifting of the blockade. According to the most well-informed sources, if an agreement is reached, the Western powers' West German plan will be completely unrelated to the agreement. It is reported that the Western powers have clearly refused to consider the Soviet proposal that they abandon the West German plan in exchange for lifting the blockade, which has been going on for about four weeks. The Western powers' main goal now is to ensure that all the details of the agreement are completely formulated in Moscow so that there will be no more breakdowns when the matter is returned to the four-power occupying military government chiefs in Berlin.</p>
<h3 id="e41">French Socialist Party Refuses to Support Reynaud; Marie Cabinet Resigns En Masse; White-Haired Ramadier May Make a Comeback <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 28th Telegraph] French Prime Minister Marie's cabinet resigned on the morning of the 28th, only one month after taking office, and France has entered a state of anarchy again. President Auriol made another attempt to mediate and consult in order to form a new cabinet. The political crisis was already very serious, but it had not reached a desperate stage. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 28th, the cabinet was deadlocked over Finance Minister Reynaud's economic reform plan, and Marie resigned as a result.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources said that the main reason for the collapse of the Marie government was the refusal of the Socialists to support Reynaud's economic decrees. Therefore, Auriol may ask the Socialists to nominate the Prime Minister. It is widely rumored that former Prime Minister Ramadier, with his white hair, may make a comeback. Ramadier was in power before the Schumann cabinet. At the same time, the collapse of the Marie government has reopened the door to power struggles between the left-wing Communists and the right-wing De Gaulle French People's Rally. Although De Gaulle is not technically prevented from taking power at present, this step must be recommended by the President of the National Assembly to the cabinet to dissolve the parliament and hold a re-election, so this move is not very likely.</p>

<p>To Prevent De Gaulle from Regaining Power</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th Telegraph] General De Gaulle's hopes of regaining power early have been indefinitely blocked as of the 27th. The French National Assembly passed a motion on the evening of the 25th by a vote of 245 to 193 to postpone the general election. General De Gaulle had hoped to win an absolute victory in the general election in October this year, as he did in last year's local elections. The result of the parliamentary vote decided that the general election would not be held until extensive technical reforms of the electoral mechanism had been completed. This is tantamount to saying that the general election will not be held as long as the anti-De Gaulle parties are willing to postpone the election. The middle parties fully manipulated the vote in parliament and received tacit support from the Communist Party.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 28th Telegraph] The South Korean National Assembly has now passed part of the law to punish pro-Japanese collaborators. The first chapter defines pro-Japanese collaborators and their punishments. The so-called pro-Japanese collaborators include: (1) those who signed the Japan-Korea Protection Treaty and the Annexation of Korea Treaty in the late Joseon Dynasty; (2) those who accepted titles from the Japanese government; (3) those who killed independence activists and their families; and (4) those who organized groups to harm the independence movement. The first three will be deprived of public office for life and have two-thirds of their property confiscated. The latter will also be deprived of office for 10 to 15 years and sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years. When the National Assembly discussed the bill, two young people in the audience shouted against the bill and distributed anti-bill propaganda. It is reported that the two young people are members of a certain right-wing party.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th Telegraph] Associated Press correspondent in Berlin, Meehan, Lippert, a reporter from the Pioneer Tribune, and a German reporter who accompanied them were arrested by the Soviet authorities. The two reporters were arrested by the Soviet police on their way to the city hall in the Soviet sector of Berlin, where demonstrations against the city government had been held recently. The American military government has demanded the immediate release of the two American reporters.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th Telegraph] According to news received here, two Soviet officers, including the commander of the Soviet forces in Berlin, Paniban Osyur, were assassinated today.

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th Telegraph] Diplomatic circles said on the 28th that the United States hopes that the non-communist countries of Western Europe can conclude the current movement and form a military alliance, and finally cooperate politically. This plan is a major part of American foreign policy. Well-informed sources said that this move shows that the United States is actively taking action and does not intend to appease the Soviet Union, in contrast to the appeasement of Germany in 1940. This policy is considered to be conducive to world peace.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Berlin City Government Plans to Relocate: City Council Chairman Demands Security Guarantee from the Soviets; Kotikov's Reply is Stern <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 27th] Following two disruptions of City Council meetings by Communist thugs, the elected Berlin city government planned on the 27th to move the city hall out of the Soviet-occupied zone. Acting Mayor Herr Fürstenberg and City Council Speaker Dr. Suhr discussed moving the city hall to one of the Western-occupied zones, both being non-Communists. However, the final decision to relocate the city hall depends on the reply of Soviet Berlin Commander Major General Kotikov.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 27th] Speaker Suhr sent a letter to Soviet Berlin Commander Kotikov, requesting clarification on the Soviet Union's responsibility for the safety of the Berlin City Council. It is believed that this letter may be a prelude to the city government's application for a new city hall site outside the Soviet-occupied zone.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th] The Berlin City Council, recently elected by the Four-Power Agreement, has been unable to convene due to Soviet dissatisfaction, leading to demonstrations by the Socialist Unity Party. City Council Chairman Dr. Suhr sent a letter today to Soviet Berlin Commander Kotikov, requesting attention to the events that occurred at the City Hall in the past two days and urging the implementation of necessary measures to ensure the safe and undisturbed convening of the Council. He also asked whether, during future City Council meetings, Soviet authorities would order future Communist demonstrations to be held at a certain distance from the City Hall. According to the statement from the Soviet Information Bureau regarding Kotikov's reply, the following questions were raised: (1) Does Dr. Suhr wish for Soviet authorities to interfere in the Berlin labor-management relations that are dissatisfied with the City Council? (2) Does Dr. Suhr wish for Soviet authorities to demand that the City Council change its current policies? (3) What policies should the Soviet Union adopt to please Dr. Suhr? The conclusion of Kotikov's reply stated that Dr. Suhr must clearly express his views on the above points so that he (Kotikov), within his authority and following the precedents of European democratic countries, can take necessary decisions.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] At a special meeting of the Allied Control Council held at 4:00 PM on the 28th, Soviet Deputy Representative Kislenko attacked MacArthur's labor policies for violating the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's resolution guaranteeing the rights of Japanese labor organizations, democratic groups, and unions. He demanded that MacArthur's restrictions "prohibiting strikes and collective bargaining by Japanese civil servants" be withdrawn. During an hour and forty minutes of debate, United Kingdom representative Shawcross also partially supported Kislenko's views. Allied Control Council Chairman and US representative Sebald firmly denied the Soviet attacks, condemned the Soviet Union for oppressing labor within its own borders, and attacked Kislenko for distorting facts for his own benefit.</p>
<p>This objective is "extremely obvious," not only in Japan but also in other unfortunate countries where the Communist Party participates in labor unions and destroys democracy. Sebald stated: If MacArthur had not taken action at that time, "a great tragedy would have already occurred." The occupying forces have adopted a completely friendly attitude towards Japanese labor, and Japanese workers enjoy far more freedom than American workers. MacArthur's recommendation to tighten control over civil servants was issued only after the deteriorating situation caused by the excessive actions of civil servant unions. Sebald pointed out that the temporary ordinance of the Japanese Cabinet will be replaced by permanent legislation passed by the Diet. Chinese representative Shang Zhen hoped that the rights of civil servants mentioned in MacArthur's letter would be fully included in Japanese law and warned against reactionary elements using the prohibition of strikes to further their purposes.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The House Un-American Activities Committee is preparing to introduce a severe US anti-espionage bill on the 28th. It is understood that this opinion will be listed in its internal report on the investigation of Soviet spies and Communist personnel within the government in wartime Washington. The report will clearly state that as a result of the committee's investigation, it was found that the McCarran-Nixon Communist Control Act was too weak in dealing with espionage issues, and new, more stringent measures are necessary. Attorney General Clark and other Justice Department officials have long believed that the current anti-espionage law is too lenient. They stated that under current law, regardless of the evidence, it is very difficult to prosecute foreign spies.</p>

<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 27th] Government authorities today accused Hungarian leaders of plotting to overthrow Marshal Tito and attempting to seize power in Yugoslavia. The government sent a 15-page official letter to the Hungarian Legation, accusing the Hungarian government, especially Communist Deputy Prime Minister Rajk, of inciting "the Yugoslav people's revolution and overthrowing the legal government of Yugoslavia." The letter demanded that Hungary cease this behavior, which "can only be interpreted as an attempt to coerce the people of another democratic country." The Yugoslav government declared, "The moral and historical responsibility for this situation lies entirely with the Hungarian government." Yugoslavia also sent a similar protest letter to Romania on Wednesday, accusing its government and its Foreign Minister Ana Pauker of unfriendly behavior. The letter criticized Hungarian government officials for "violating the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between Yugoslavia and Hungary, and openly launching an anti-Yugoslav campaign."</p>
<h3 id="e55">Malaya Offers Reward for the Arrest of Twelve Terrorists, Seven of Whom are Leaders of the Malayan Communist Party <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 27th] The Malayan Federal Government believes that the main party leaders of the Malayan Communist Party are the leaders of the terrorists. Yesterday, it publicly offered a reward of 120,000 yuan for the arrest of these twelve ringleaders. Several well-known Communist Party members are among those wanted. At least seven of them had traveled to England as representatives of Malaya to participate in the victory parade. These twelve are Wu Tianwang, Li Song, Peng Kunying, Fang Chunluo, Zhou Yakang, Deng Fuliang, Chen Tian, Liu Ma, Weng Chenghua, Song Wenheng, Bai Ziying, and Huang Qing. (All of the above are transliterations.) Wu Tianwang was once regarded by the United States as one of the three main leaders of the Malayan Communist Party. After attending the British Communist Party Congress in London last year and returning to Malaya, he gave travelling speeches encouraging listeners to join the Communist Party. He brought a small flag of the British Communist Party to Malaya, which bore the message from the British Communist Party to Malayan comrades, guaranteeing support for the Malayan Communist Party in the struggle for freedom. This flag has been discovered in Kuala Lumpur. Li Song traveled to Calcutta this year as a representative of Malaya to participate in the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Chen Tian attended the International Youth Conference in Prague and only returned from the United Kingdom a month before the riots.</p>

<h3 id="e58">World Post-War Situation Unstable and Turbulent; Bullitt Blames Roosevelt; Wavering China Policy and Excessive Appeasement of Stalin <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] Life magazine, owned by Luce, began today to publish a series of articles by former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William Bullitt. Bullitt's articles, titled "How We Won the War and Lost the Peace," analyze American foreign policy from 1933 to the present under the successive administrations of Roosevelt and Truman. The articles discuss America's current position in the world, the reasons for its entry into this situation, and its current direction. However, Bullitt stated that these were his personal observations. In the first article, Bullitt attributed the post-war instability to Roosevelt. He criticized the late president for failing to obtain compensation for American Lend-Lease aid during the war, demanding that Stalin guarantee respect for America's vital interests in a free and independent Europe and a free and independent China. Bullitt stated that Stalin's struggle against Hitler in 1941 gave the United States control over power in world politics, but the United States failed to use this power to require Stalin to guarantee that Europe and Asia would enjoy freedom and peace after the war. Bullitt's article stated that he and several other people had strongly urged Roosevelt to write to Stalin, requesting a formal and public guarantee that he would not invade Europe in the future, nor make demands on China before granting the Soviet Union Lend-Lease aid. Unfortunately, Roosevelt rejected Bullitt's suggestions because (1) such guarantees were of little value because Stalin could renounce them later; and (2) he (Roosevelt) was confident that he could use appeasement to transform Stalin from a Soviet imperialist into a democratic partner. Therefore, Roosevelt's decision was responsible for the creation of today's situation. Bullitt insisted that if his advice had been adopted, Stalin would not have been able to gain control over 120 million people in Eastern Europe as he does today, and the communist threat in China would have been eliminated. Even if Stalin had disregarded his promise and broken his word, the American people would have been alerted and prepared for a response. Bullitt's article also repeatedly discusses American policies towards China and Japan, and the resulting situation in China. In essence, it states that when Roosevelt took office as president in 1933, he had a definite belief in American foreign policy: that the consequences of Japan's invasion of China in 1931 could not be adequately addressed by adhering to President Hoover's policy of refusing to recognize any agreement that would undermine China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Roosevelt's view was such that he instructed Secretary of State Hull to inform Japan that in fact, there was no problem between the United States and Japan that could not be resolved peacefully. Bullitt stated that the American government's reliance on this definite belief in peaceful methods was the origin of America's unwise policy of appeasing Japan, which resulted in the unfortunate Pearl Harbor incident. The article further stated that three years after Roosevelt took office, by early 1936, the United States was in a state of complete isolation. At that time, among the major countries, only China, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, was able to cooperate closely with the United States. On March 7 of the same year, Hitler marched into the Rhineland, and news that Japan might attack China again also reached Washington. In the summer of that year, Roosevelt was forced to reassess the international situation based on America's security needs. One of Roosevelt's conclusions after the reassessment was that the American people could, at times through peaceful means, and when necessary through war, prevent any country from destroying China's independence, mobilizing China's manpower and resources, and ultimately attacking the United States. Bullitt stated that this was a new development of the old Open Door Policy. After Japan's invasion in 1937, Roosevelt realized that his desire to maintain America in a state of peace was incompatible with his intention to prevent Japan from ultimately mobilizing Chinese manpower and resources to wage war against the United States. Therefore, on October 5, Roosevelt delivered his "quarantine the aggressor" speech, which sparked strong domestic opposition. As a result, two months later, after Japan sank the American gunboat Panay near Nanjing, Roosevelt continued to allow Japan to purchase materials in the United States necessary for its invasion of China, including scrap metal. Bullitt suggested "demanding that Stalin provide a written guarantee as a condition for the United States to provide Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union, but Roosevelt rejected this, risking the danger that the Soviet Union might occupy and rule Central and Eastern Europe after Germany was defeated, and that the Soviet Union would threaten China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity after Japan was defeated." After Roosevelt decided to take a gamble, relying on his ability to appease Stalin in an attempt to transform his Soviet imperialism into cooperation with our democracy, Roosevelt did his best to please the Soviet dictator. Subsequently, pro-Soviet propaganda was launched in full force domestically. One of these propaganda lines stated that the Chinese Communists were "merely land reformers and had nothing to do with Moscow." At the same time, a network of sympathizers with the Soviet Union was established in Washington, and the advisors sent to the Chinese government and Latin America at that time were actually apologists for Soviet policy.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo, the economic supervisor of the Shanghai district, ordered the Special Criminal Division of the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday to immediately inspect the amount of cotton yarn and cloth stored in various warehouses. If any materials registered with the Social Affairs Bureau are found to have been unstored for more than three months, they will be sealed and confiscated. Upon receiving the order, the police bureau immediately dispatched teams to carry out the task.

<h3 id="e62">Scalpers Buy Chickens and Ducks: Social Affairs Bureau to Arrest Them <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The person in charge of the Chicken and Duck Industry Association stated to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday that the industry will comply with orders and not exceed the "August 19th" price limit for chicken and duck prices. However, this will inevitably lead to two malpractices: (1) Scalpers will privately buy chickens and ducks at prices that are one or two jiao higher than the price limit and resell them for profit. (2) Chicken and duck vendors will directly sell to retailers or users at higher prices. They requested the Social Affairs Bureau to stop these practices. The Social Affairs Bureau will cooperate with the military police to arrest scalpers to protect the interests of legitimate chicken and duck merchants. As for the second point, they stated that investigation is difficult and they are unable to help.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Requests to Revise Ticket Prices for Peking Opera and Yue Opera Not Approved <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The person in charge of the Drama Industry and Yue Opera Industry Association submitted two difficult situations to the Social Affairs Bureau: (1) Summer is the off-season for theaters, and business is generally poor. Therefore, ticket prices are reduced in the summer as a rule. If theaters adhere to the "August 19th" prices, it will be the lowest average price for the year, and the expenses of the theaters will be unsustainable. (2) Too many famous actors are unwilling to perform in the summer. In early June, Yue Opera stars are all resting. The "August 19th" ticket prices are based on the prices for ordinary actors. Therefore, they request that the ticket prices be adjusted when famous actors perform in the future. The Peking Opera theater requested an adjustment of 90% of the ticket prices, and the Yue Opera industry also requested a revision of the new ticket prices. The Social Affairs Bureau rejected both requests and instructed them to strictly adhere to the "August 19th" prices and not to request adjustments casually. The Yue Opera theaters that are performing new plays are allowed to use the ticket prices of Yin Guifang at the Lyceum Theatre as the standard and are not allowed to exceed them. In the future, if there are famous actors performing, they must submit a report stating the reasons before approval will be given.</p>

<p>The People's Service Station of the Pacification and Construction Brigade will begin work today (the 29th), accepting suggestions from citizens regarding the government and secret reports regarding unscrupulous merchants and corrupt officials. The station chiefs for each station have been decided as follows: (1) Huangpu District: Ding Dequan, (2) Lao Zha District: Cui Yijun, (3) Xincheng District: Yang Linyu, (4) Jing'an Temple District: Chen Shangzhang, (5) North Sichuan Road District: Wang Guofan, (6) North Station District: He Jinchu, (7) Tilanqiao District: Cui Wenbin, (8) Xujiahui District: Li Qinglan, (9) Lujiawan District: Zhang Huaien, (10) Penglai District: Shi Daoli. The locations are temporarily set up in front of the district government offices. Furthermore, in order to explain the significance of the establishment of the People's Service Station, the brigade issued a message to the citizens as follows: People say that Shanghai is a preposterous island. After experiencing it for a short time, we who have come to Shanghai believe that Shanghai is a deep abyss of pain. We have witnessed the cruel brutality of the communist bandits at the front lines. In Shanghai, we are even more aware of the crimes of unscrupulous merchants who manipulate and speculate. A small number of them have become rich, while the majority of kind people are trampled underfoot, living miserable lives under the iron heel of existence. These few shameless scoundrels do not love the country, do not love the government, have no warm blood, and have no conscience, and are deeply hated by the vast majority of our kind people. It is only because these people usually have money and power, create chaos and blessings, collude and conspire, and act as accomplices that everyone dares to be angry but dares not speak out. Today should be the time for the forces of justice to rise. We boldly appeal to all compatriots in Shanghai who have blood and righteousness: The pain in everyone's heart should be transformed into powerful action today. Now that the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures have been promulgated, this is the president's will, the government's decision, and also the key to the life and death of the country and the vital livelihood issues of the people. This measure can no longer be allowed to be destroyed or obstructed by these few scoundrels. The kind, patriotic, and righteous people should unite to ensure its complete implementation. Our team is ordered to be stationed in Shanghai, and we sincerely want to serve everyone. In order to communicate the opinions of the people and the government, and in order to combat the conspiracies of unscrupulous merchants and scoundrels, it has been decided to set up secret reporting boxes in the Huangpu, Xincheng, Lao Zha, Penglai, North Sichuan Road, North Station, Tilanqiao, Xujiahui, Lujiawan, and Jing'an Temple Road districts to publicly accept citizens' secret reports on illegal merchants and corrupt officials. Anyone who hoards, speculates, engages in illegal transactions, or harms the implementation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures, or colludes with officials, regardless of whether they are wealthy or powerful, are welcome to be reported. We believe that as long as everyone can unite and rise up together, we will surely be able to eliminate this scourge of society."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the government implemented currency system reform and announced measures to reorganize finances and strengthen economic controls, regulations stipulate that the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises should not exceed those of civil servants of the same level by more than 30%. However, the salaries of most employees of state-owned enterprises in this city are calculated according to the cost-of-living index, similar to those of private enterprises. If the new regulations are followed, their actual income may decrease. Therefore, employees of state-owned enterprises such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the various affiliated factories of the China Textile Construction Corporation are worried and hope that the government will provide an explanation. It has been learned that the Ministry of Social Affairs yesterday telegraphed the Social Bureau, stating that workers in state-owned factories who were previously paid according to the cost-of-living index should continue to be treated the same as workers in private factories. Staff members should still receive a 30% increase in salary compared to civil servants of the same level.</p>

The meeting was attended by Jiang Hao, Shao Yongsheng, Jiang Shoutang, Ge Jiazhen, Zhang Zhongyuan, representatives of the Wuxian Tenants' Association, representatives of the Nanjing Road Business Association, and more than 80 tenant representatives from various neighborhoods. Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi was also invited to attend. During the meeting, the representatives argued that since the income of citizens has been frozen, rents should also be frozen in accordance with government laws and regulations. As a result, eight resolutions were passed: (1) Rents should be frozen in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the government. (2) Petition Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo, economic supervisors of the Shanghai area, to stop rent increases. (3) Request the Land Administration Bureau to pay attention to the economic emergency measures. Since the government has clearly stipulated the freezing of prices, it is not necessary to request further clarification on whether rent is an exception. Moreover, according to Supervisory Committee member Ni, rent should be considered a commodity price according to law. Since the government froze all commodity prices on August 19, rent cannot be an exception. (4) Request Supervisory Committee member Ni to pay attention to the Land Administration Bureau's measures regarding rent. (5) Request the City Council to carefully handle the rent issue. (6) Request the government to explicitly prohibit rent collection in kind. (7) The General Tenants' Association will hold its inaugural meeting on September 9.

In addition, 850,000 tons of food will be imported from abroad within one year, from July of this year to July of next year. Among them, 40% will be US aid, and 60% will be purchased by the Ministry of Food. In addition, the Central Bank has recently exchanged fertilizer for grain in Taiwan and various provinces in South China, totaling 52,000 tons, which has also been allocated to the committee for distribution and sale. Yang said: The total amount of food needed by the six cities averages about 100,000 tons per month (of which flour accounts for more than 30,000 tons). With the cooperation of all parties concerned, there should be no problem with future supply. According to the committee, 6,300 long tons of Burmese rice ordered by the Ministry of Food will arrive in Shanghai on September 1, and 13,778 long tons of US aid rice will be shipped in succession from the 21st to the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A man named Zhao Tongyan recently came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang to seek employment with his cousin, Xie Shusheng, but because the address was unknown, he could not find him. He was wandering on the street when he met Zhang Jinyuan, Wei Guangxian, and others, who tricked him into staying overnight at the Xin Inn on Minguo Road. He then met Wang Fuxing and Liu Yunqing, who said they could introduce him to the army in Ningbo and bought him a ticket on the Jiangjing ship. On the afternoon of the 27th, Wei Guangxian, Wang Fuxing, Liu Yunqing, and others accompanied him to the ship. Zhao realized he had been deceived and refused to go, and Wei and others threatened to kill him, which led to an argument. The police officers of the China Merchants Bureau's police team noticed this, stepped forward to inquire, and Zhao told them that he had been tricked into going to Ningbo to join the army. The police officers arrested Wei, Wang, and Liu and took them to the police team for interrogation. It was learned that Wei and others were suspected of trafficking recruits. Yesterday, a document was prepared and they were all sent to the local court for legal action. However, the main culprit, Zhang Jinyuan, is still at large.</p>

<p>Mr. Tongji, a reader of this newspaper, donated 2,912.08 gold yuan and 8,736,240,000 legal tender to the "Reader's Aid to Education Fund," which can help 60 impoverished college students avoid dropping out of school, setting a record for the highest donation to the "Reader's Aid to Education Fund" this year.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Tongji, he lost his opportunity to be educated at a young age, and relied on relatives and friends to raise him. He started a business later in life, and with hard work and frugality, laid the foundation for his career. However, remembering the pain of losing his chance to attend school as a child, he cannot help but feel sad. Therefore, he donated this sum to support this newspaper's aid to education movement. Because Mr. Tongji does not want to be famous, his remarks were vague, but his enthusiasm for helping education was overflowing on his face. In addition to accepting the donation, this newspaper extends its sincere gratitude on behalf of countless impoverished students.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government held a municipal meeting yesterday morning, presided over by Mayor Wu, to discuss how to make up for the municipal financial deficit, but no concrete decision was made, so the Information Office did not publish it. It is learned that regarding the adjustment of housing donations to make up for the deficit, internal statistical work is currently underway. It is estimated that levying housing donations based on the 1937 rental valuation would increase the municipal government's monthly revenue by 1.2 million yuan, but it must be submitted to the City Council for approval before implementation. In addition, Financial Bureau Director Tian Yorang was unable to bear the costs of public education employees in this month, so he came to Nanjing the night before to ask the central government for subsidies. He will also consult with the central government on adjusting housing donations and land taxes. Details will be revealed after Director Tian returns to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Four Floods in Shaanxi Flow Through Lu Territory's Luokou to Observe the Autumn Flood of the Yellow River <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Li Tian</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 24th] Since records began, the Yellow River has changed its course seven times and breached its banks 1,580 times, resulting in countless losses of life and property and weakening the nation's vitality. Therefore, although the Yellow River is the birthplace of ancient Chinese culture and the cradle of the Chinese nation, what it has left to the Chinese people are only countless painful memories. Now that the autumn flood season is approaching again, in this year of particularly frequent floods across the country, your reporter cannot forget the Yellow River, which is particularly prone to disasters. Taking advantage of the fact that the fourth flood in Shaanxi in the upper reaches of the Yellow River is expected to flow through Luokou in the province on the 24th, I made a special trip to the riverbank for on-the-spot investigation.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Director Kong of the Shandong Repair and Prevention Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Bureau and Engineer Chen Yungong, your reporter left Jinan by jeep early in the morning of the 24th and headed north. After the car exited Tianqiao, what came into view was a vast expanse of sorghum, its red ears solid and drooping heavily in the sunlight, forming a yellow sea, which can be called a unique spectacle found only in the north. After arriving at Luokou, we first rested at the flood control team. To the left of the team's gate, there was a forest of steles, all of which recorded the meritorious deeds of predecessors in controlling the Yellow River. Then we ascended the riverbank and saw the rapid current, the turbulent waves, the surging rush, and the surrounding danger. According to a person in charge of the flood control team: the current water level has reached 30.02 meters, which is the highest water level record this year. The water is only about three meters away from the top of the levee at the highest point, and less than two meters at the lowest point. Even at the current water level, the water surface is already three or four feet higher than the tops of the sorghum stalks outside the levee. One can imagine the severity of the damage and the extent of the disaster if the levee were to break.</p>
<p>Many Dangerous Works in Lu Territory</p>
<p>From Luokou eastward, within the 35 kilometers under the control of the National Army, there are nine dangerous works, including Gajia Gou, Jijiabang, Houzhuangzhuang, Fujiazhuang, Huojialiu, Hetaoquan, Chenmengquan, Wangjiali Hang, and Hujia'an. Within the 22 kilometers westward from Yukou, there are four dangerous works, including Laoshuzhuang, Yangzhuang, Caojiaquan, and Beidianzi. Within the 32 kilometers westward from the north bank of Luokou, there are thirteen dangerous works, including Dawangmiao, Wangjia Yao, Qiujianbang, Li Jiabang, Xijia Daokou, Wangzhuang, Nantan, Gujiagou, Wulipu, Xujiafang, Yuansuozhuang, Shuiniu Zhaozhuang, and Doufuwo (of which the Wangjia Yao and Gujiagou sections are in the hands of bandits). Director Kong told me: there has been river defense since Mengjin, but the total length of the Yellow River's west bank is about 200 kilometers in Henan, 160 kilometers in Hebei, and more than 700 kilometers in Shandong. If we include the more than 200 kilometers of civil embankments that have been taken over by the government, it reaches more than 900 kilometers. Therefore, on average, there is a dangerous work every ten or so kilometers. Therefore, the total length of the stone embankment of the Yellow River in Shandong is as long as 70 kilometers, so there are the most dangerous works in the territory of Lu. Of all the breaches in the 93 years since the sixth change of course of the Yellow River in the fifth year of Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty, those in Shandong accounted for two-thirds of the total.</p>
<p>Another reason why the Yellow River breaches its banks so frequently in Shandong is that after the Yellow River enters the territory of Henan, the widest point of the riverbed reaches more than 20 miles, while in the territory of Lu, such as between Yue Zhuang and Cao Jia Quan, about 20 kilometers northwest of Luokou, the river surface is only more than 400 meters wide, and at the narrowest point in Lijin, it is only more than 300 meters wide. Therefore, the maximum capacity of the Yellow River channel in Henan can reach more than 30,000 cubic meters per second, while after entering Lu, it is only 8,000 cubic meters per second.</p>
<p>Heading to Beidianzi</p>
<p>We sat in the jeep and continued to inspect Luokou along the Yellow River embankment via Laoshuzhuang, Yangzhuang, Caojiaquan, to Beidianzi. In the past, trees were planted everywhere on the west bank of the Yellow River embankment, forming an endless expanse of green. When cars drove on it, people outside the embankment could not see the cars because they were shielded by the shade of the trees. However, since the seventh change of course of the Yellow River in Huayuankou, Henan in June 27, most of the villagers believe that the Yellow River will not come again. Over the past ten years, all the trees have been cut down. Today, not only is the river embankment not beautiful, but also when there is a need for materials in case of danger, temporary requisition is also difficult.</p>
<p>Yangzhuang is about fifteen or six kilometers away from Jinan City and about eight kilometers away from the old Jinan Airport. This place is the largest dangerous work near Jinan City. The water channel is biased towards the south bank, the water depth reaches 15 meters, and the flow is particularly fierce. The repair and prevention office has built stone embankments here to resist floods. The north bank of Yangzhuang is the bandit area, so the defense here is particularly important. After we stopped for a while, we continued westward.</p>
<p>When the car passed near Caojiaquan, more than ten workers were urgently filling a dangerous work with grass bags. Director Kong said: Don't underestimate them. If no one repairs it for a few hours or overnight, there may be trouble. In the past, most of the breaches in the Yellow River were due to the dishonesty of the people involved. Many of the river workers were corrupt and enriched themselves. Either the funds were insufficient, the workers were insufficient, or the materials were insufficient.</p>
<p>Beidianzi is the end point of our trip. This is an ancient ferry, and the city of Qihe County is on the opposite bank of the river. Before the train was open, people going to Beiping from Jinan mostly went here to Jihe to stay overnight. Now, due to the interruption of the train, this place has actually become an important ferry for the exchange of materials between bandits and us. When we inspected, we saw a large number of mules and horses transporting cotton yarn to the north on a ferry.</p>
<p>Five Construction Zones</p>
<p>Heading west from Beidianzi, you officially enter the bandit area, and of course we cannot go. Director Kong said: River work can be divided into five zones according to the difficulty of construction. The first is the pure Communist bandit control zone, which is not discussed here. The second is the pure National Army control zone, where construction is not difficult. The third is the bandit-us connection zone, where there are many difficulties. The fourth is the buffer zone, where the bandits do not dare to come, and we do not dare to go, but in case a breach occurs, the common people are always the people of the country. Therefore, we still have to try our best to mobilize the people and requisition labor and materials to give them emergency repairs. The fifth is the area where the bandits are active, such as the area from Zhukou to Dongkou in western Shandong last year, where the bandits entered and exited three times, and this year they have entered and exited twice. Three of our repair and prevention personnel were killed, and more than 30 were captured and missing. The loss of materials is countless. At the end of June this year, western Shandong was in urgent need of help. Before Kaifeng was lost, the government subsidized the employees who escaped from the construction site from Dongkou Linhui with only 30 million per person, which could not even buy a quilt. But in extremely difficult circumstances, they have completed the most solid river defense project. Mr. He, a 76-year-old scholar who has served in river work for more than 40 years, said that he has never seen a river defense project that is "strong in construction and solid in materials" like the current Lu Xi repair and prevention project. The reason is that as long as the Yellow River breaches its banks by one meter in Lu Xi, the entire Lu Xi and even northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. Therefore, we have to make the greatest efforts and brave all difficulties to repair the river embankment.</p>
<p>Autumn Flood Can Be Safely Passed</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, your reporter returned to Jinan. At this time, the water level in Luokou had dropped back to 29.20 meters. On the way back, a gratifying piece of news is worth reporting to the people of the country: Last year, during the autumn flood, there were a total of five major floods in Shaanxi in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The highest water level in Luokou reached 30.5 meters. This year, Shaanxi has already had four floods, and the highest water level in Yukou is 30.02 meters today. In addition, there was less snowfall in the upper reaches of the Yellow River last year. According to reliable estimates by the repair and prevention personnel, the water level in Luokou this year will definitely not exceed last year's record. Due to the day and night close guarding of the river defense personnel, the autumn flood, which has the highest water level and the most fierce flow among the four floods of the year (Peach Flood,伏Flood, Autumn Flood, Ling Flood), can be safely passed.</p>

<h3 id="e94">An Overview of Taiwan's National Economy <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shouren, Our Concurrent Special Correspondent</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Taipei, 26th] Your reporter has traveled to Taiwan for eight months and has made many observations on the economic situation in Taiwan. The conclusion reached is that the system is based on agricultural economy, supplemented by industrial economy. Analyzed, the agricultural economy is based on food. Here, I will first give a general description of its production:</p>
<p>Looking at Food Production from the Japanese Colonial Period</p>
<p>Because of the superior conditions in terms of weather and environment, Taiwan's food harvest can be two crops a year. During the Japanese colonial period, it was known as the "rice granary." The highest production in the past was in 1938, with a total of 1,402,444 tons, while its own consumption was only 734,516 tons. The remaining 600,000 tons were all supplied to the Japanese mainland. Looking at such a large gap between supply and demand, we can imagine how prosperous the rural economy was. However, the lives of farmers were still only able to maintain a basic livelihood. This is probably due to the degree of exploitation by the Japanese colonial policy.</p>
<p>During the war, due to the lack of fertilizer and the conscription of strong men from the countryside, food production declined sharply year by year, reaching only 1,068,121 tons in 1944. In 1945, when the island was recovered, it was only 638,828 tons. The degree of sharp decline from a stage of food surplus to food shortage is alarming. To study the crux of the problem, we need to first focus on Taiwan's geological problems. In fact, the construction of Taiwan's agricultural economic society simply has no inherent conditions to rely on. The geology is a sandy accumulation layer, unlike the mainland, which can rely on natural fertilizer and irrigation. Although there are 19 major rivers, each one is as stubborn as the Yellow River. If appropriate guidance is not given, not only will there be no water conservancy, but also floods will occur every year due to typhoons and floods, harming farmland. Therefore, during the Japanese colonial period, they focused on these two problems. For irrigation, they used chemical fertilizers, with the highest supply reaching 600,000 tons. For water control, they built many water conservancy projects. The total length of the dikes in the province reached 419,153 meters. However, the intention of the Japanese government was very harmful. Most of the fertilizer manufacturing plants that supplied irrigation to Taiwan's farmland were located in Japan, and the dikes for water conservancy also had to be properly maintained and repaired every year, otherwise they would lose their effectiveness, making Taiwan unable to escape from Japan and becoming a fake independent agricultural society. Therefore, after the recovery, the first difficulty was the severe panic caused by fertilizer. According to statistics, in 1945, farmers only received 2,000 tons of fertilizer supplied by the government. The second difficulty was dike breaches and floods. At that time, the government had just recovered and did not pay attention to water conservancy issues. According to statistics, in 1945 and 1946, the total length of dike breaches in the province reached 50,000 meters, and approximately 100,000 hectares of farmland were damaged. Both of these were the main reasons for the sharp decline in food production.</p>
<p>Seeking Water Conservancy Construction and Increasing Fertilizer Imports</p>
<p>Afterwards, the government worked hard to govern, first seeking water conservancy construction and increasing fertilizer imports. To this day, the former has repaired 24,000 meters of dikes, and the latter's fertilizer imports were 85,000 tons in 1946. Therefore, food production was able to increase to 891,417 tons, which was just enough to meet the province's consumption. In 1947, fertilizer imports were still 85,000 tons. Due to the restoration of water conservancy, the increase in cultivated land, and the successive return of conscripted strong men, food production had increased to 999,012 tons. In 1948, the central government allocated fertilizer purchased from the United States, totaling 95,000 tons. However, because the food year has not yet ended, production cannot be accurately calculated, but it is generally estimated that it will increase significantly compared to last year. From the aforementioned figures, we can see that Taiwan's food has returned to a normal supply-demand balance in 1946, and since 1947, it has even reached a stage of oversupply. When the whole country is generally experiencing food shortages, this has to be said to be the superiority of Taiwan's agricultural economy.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Enjoys a High Reputation, a Painful History</p>
<p>In addition to food, the Taiwan Sugar, which occupies an important part of the agricultural economy, should be considered. Taiwan Sugar enjoys the highest reputation in the mainland, and is known to women and children. It also has a certain reputation in the international market. This is the foundation established by the Japanese colonial policy. According to the elders of Taiwan, when food production was as high as 1.3 million tons in 1935, the Japanese government was alerted to the high surplus of food in Taiwan, which would endanger the rural economy of the Japanese mainland. Therefore, it adopted a policy of suppressing production. In order to achieve this policy, the Taiwan Governor-General forced compatriots to convert part of their farmland to sugarcane cultivation. At the same time, Japanese financial groups also invested heavily in setting up large-scale sugar factories in various parts of Taiwan to purchase sugarcane for sugar processing at a limited price, on the one hand to supply the needs of the mainland, and on the other hand to dump it on the international market, in order to achieve the purpose of pure exploitation. Why do I say this is pure exploitation, because Taiwan's natural conditions such as rainfall, sunshine, and temperature are not suitable for sugarcane cultivation, and the damage of typhoons has a greater impact on sugar factory equipment and sugarcane than on food crops. Moreover, food crops can be harvested twice a year, while sugarcane takes 18 months to harvest. In terms of the farmers' own interests, under the circumstances of Japanese financial groups purchasing sugarcane at a limited price, sugarcane cultivation does not have any real benefits. However, because it is beneficial to Japan, it has made Taiwan Sugar have today's scale.</p>
<p>Tracing the history of the formation of Taiwan Sugar's current scale, this is a page of painful memories. 121,362 Jia (each Jia equals 14.4 Mu) of sugarcane cultivation area from farmland were successively owned by the Taiwan Sugar Industry Order of the Taiwan Governor-General of the Japanese administration. The highest sugar production reached 418,000 tons, and what the sugarcane farmers got was the meager profit they earned from the limited-price purchase. Apart from the minimum necessities of food and clothing, they did not taste more sweetness than others. After the recovery, all the sugarcane fields were taken over and continued to be planted, and the 35 sugar factories operated by Japanese businessmen also resumed work one after another. By 1947 and 1948, production had reached 263,596 tons, of which only 51,000 tons were needed in the province, and the rest were supplied to the domestic, Southeast Asian and Japanese markets for publicity dumping. Your reporter observes that the different characteristic of Taiwan's sugar industry today and in the past is that in the past, it was one of the important resources for Japan to exploit Taiwan, while now it is one of the lifelines of Chen Village's economy. We can understand the general situation by looking at the treatment of sugarcane farmers by Hetang Company.</p>
<p>Sugarcane Farmers' Sugar Sharing System, Enjoy Four Types of Loans</p>
<p>Although sugarcane needs 18 months to harvest, the income of sugarcane farmers must be 12 months later than that of field farmers. In other words, field farmers harvest three times, and sugarcane farmers harvest only once. The hardships between them can be imagined. However, because the sugar industry company has a unique remuneration system, the sugarcane farmers' basic livelihood is also not a problem. This unique remuneration system is called the sugar sharing system. In short, for example, if a sugarcane farmer plants and harvests sugarcane that can produce 1,000 kilograms of sugar, then the sugarcane farmer can get the discounted price of 500 kilograms of sugar, and the rest can get 500 kilograms of sugar in kind, allowing the sugarcane farmer to freely dispose of and sell it freely. Currently, the discounted price set by the sugar industry company is NT$350 per kilogram. In addition, sugarcane farmers can often enjoy four types of loans, including sugarcane seedling loans, farming loans, land rent loans, and fertilizer loans. At present, the average annual production of each sugarcane farmer's household is about 41,344 kilograms, and its surplus income is used to pay for the 18-month living burden, which is more than enough.</p>

<p>Killing More Than Seventy, Capturing More Than Sixty</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the announcement of the First Military Region Command of the Navy: Recently, there have been gangs of bandits Wang Rongxuan and Xu Xiaoyu in the sea area of Dinghai, Zhejiang East, harassing the area, and the situation was once quite tense. After the Zhejiang Pacification Command and the Naval Base Command launched a clean-up operation, on the 21st of this month, warships such as Lian Guang, Xiang Shan, and Yi Ning transported anti-bandit troops to land on the northeast ends of the Liheng Island bandit nests. Our army attacked from both sides. More than 200 bandits stubbornly resisted the mountain. After gradual advancement, more than 70 bandits were killed, and more than 60 people were captured. The remaining bandits have been surrounded at the top of Jiaozhi Mountain, and it is not difficult to wipe them all out. At 7:00 PM on the same day, our Yi Ning and Xiang Shan boats discovered a bandit boat in the sea area of Li Qingshan and immediately opened fire to bombard it. Many bandits were killed or injured, and the rest jumped into the water to escape. The bandit boat was hit in the stern and captured. In addition, one escaped bandit was captured on the water.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Zhenhai Rent Surge <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Meng Weizhong</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenhai, 24th Dispatch] The "Zhejiang Provisional Measures for Rent Reduction of 25% for Tenant Farmers," were formulated and promulgated as early as the 15th year of the Republic of China, spanning over two decades. In the initial stages of implementation, numerous difficulties were inevitable. However, based on the results of various counties that implemented the measures, they "reduced tenancy disputes," which was convenient for both officials and the people. Zhenhai, in eastern Zhejiang, took the lead and was able to thoroughly implement the rent reduction measures from the beginning. Over the years, both tenants and landlords have been able to smoothly navigate the "rent barrier," which cannot be attributed to anything other than the power of this method. Recently, in order to implement land reform, our government authorities promulgated the Land Law. When the news spread, the farmers rejoiced. The tenant farmers throughout this county, concerned about their rights and interests, specifically published a "Declaration by the Chenmin (common people) of Zhenhai County to Support the Suppression of Rebellion and Implement the Land Law" in newspapers on August 11th, declaring that rent for this year would be paid according to Article 110 of the Land Law, which stipulates that land rent should be 8% of the assessed land price and the government-announced standard land price (converted to rice). When this news reached the landlords, it caused extreme resentment, and the "rent surge" incident thus began.</p>
<p>When the Land Law was first promulgated, agricultural association cadres were already brewing implementation plans. When a typhoon struck the county on July 6th, affecting 57,728.04 mu of land and 23,725 people, it became the fuse for this rent surge. On July 27th, the farmers of various villages south of the river, in light of the severe typhoon disaster and the approaching time for early rice harvest and rent collection, proposed abolishing the fixed rent (37.5% rent payment) and requested the county government to approve rent collection by village according to the Jiangbei (north of the river) custom. The county rejected this request, stating that it would "be difficult to change the established customs and regulations, which would only lead to disputes." Subsequently, the county agricultural association, concerned that the Chenmin in various places had differing opinions on rent payment and fearing disputes, convened a joint meeting of over thirty executive directors of agricultural associations from various villages on August 6th to discuss a unified rent payment method. After deliberation, it was decided that "starting this year, rent will be paid at 8% of the land price according to Article 110 of the Land Law." Representatives were appointed on the spot, including Zhang Yunfa from Qinghu, Gao Shanfang from Xinqi, Lu Maotang from Zhenpu, Li Lianggui from Daqi, and seventeen others. Led by Gu Jingyong, the executive director of the county agricultural association, they petitioned the county government on the 11th and then went to Shanghai and Beijing. They arrived in the capital on the 12th and submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Land Affairs on the 13th. The Executive Yuan received them through Secretary Li, the Ministry of Social Affairs was personally led by Minister Gu, and the Ministry of Land Affairs was led by Vice Minister Tang and Director Wu. They praised and encouraged the representatives' spirit of rushing to Beijing and striving for their own interests, and promised to discuss the matter at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting. They requested the Zhejiang Provincial Government to handle the matter. On the 14th, the representatives went to Hangzhou again to petition the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, and the Provincial Farmers' Association. As a result, Director Hong of the Land Administration Bureau expressed his acceptance and stated that he would wait for orders to handle the matter. The representatives returned to the county on the 16th. After the petition, the tenant farmers, while waiting for official orders, except for paying the pre-collected grain tax on behalf of the landlords, temporarily suspended rent payment.</p>
<p>After this blow, the landlords were panic-stricken, especially the charitable estates, schools, and small property owners who had invested in land. They jointly refuted and issued a public statement on the 24th. At the same time, they appointed representatives to petition the province, supporting the 25% rent reduction decision to counter the tenant farmers.</p>
<p>The rent payment dispute between landlords and tenants seems to have moved from a dormant state to a serious stage. Chairman Chen of Zhejiang Province has not made a concrete statement because the relevant official documents have not arrived, but he has stated that the provincial government is determined to reduce the burden on tenant farmers, but the legitimate rights and interests of landlords will be protected. Under these two principles, it is hoped that this incident can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily for both tenants and landlords.</p>

<p>(Continued from yesterday's second edition)</p>
<p>The Petition Process</p>
<p>(2) The petition process: (1) The City Council's Petition: At 7:00 AM on July 5th, students from northeastern provinces and cities gathered in front of the Zhongnanhai gate. By 8:00 AM, approximately 4,000 students from more than ten units swarmed into the Peiping City Council, destroying offices and dormitories with bricks and wooden sticks, shouting slogans such as "Oppose Hunger," "Oppose Persecution," and "Kill the City Councilors," and posting slogans. They climbed onto the lintel by stacking themselves on top of each other and changed the Peiping City Council plaque to "Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry Association" and "Three Olds and Four Youngs Association." Dozens of students from the Peiping Student Union held up green banners with red characters reading "We Want to Survive" and "We Want Freedom," and gave comfort to the students from the northeast provinces, making inflammatory speeches, welcoming the northeast students to join the student union, and destroying the "Peiping City National Mobilization Committee" and the "Peiping Public Anti-Communist Committee" (these two organizations were both located in the same building as the City Council). The workers and police officers maintaining order suffered minor injuries. At this time, the students sat in the middle of the road, demanding that the responsible members of the City Council come forward to answer, but no one came to meet them. At 11:00 AM, Director Chen Kefu of Lin Da (National Temporary University) and a professor tried to persuade the students to wait for a reasonable solution, but it was ineffective. The students then broke into the City Council again and caused further destruction. Mei Qinglan, the head of the 19th Regiment of the military police, had his glasses broken after being hit. After police persuasion, they were forced to withdraw and marched in a group towards the residence of Vice President Li on North Chang Street. (2) The Petition at the Residence of Vice President Li: At around 12:00 PM, a large group of students arrived in front of the residence of Vice President Li on North Chang Street. They sent representatives to visit the Vice President to petition. As the Vice President was attending a meeting at Jurentang (Hall of Benevolence), he walked back after a while and replied to the representatives, roughly saying: 1. He suggested that the government strengthen Lin Da and Lin Zhong (temporary schools), so that students from public and private schools would have the opportunity to study; 2. The resettlement and relief issues would be discussed with local authorities, and temporary funds would be allocated from the self-defense special tax, so the principle was no longer a problem; 3. The City Council would issue a statement based on the facts. When the students demanded that the City Council apologize to the students, the Vice President replied that the City Council was a representative of public opinion and that he could not control them. The students were dissatisfied and proposed going to Xu Huidong's residence to petition, so they marched in a group, shouting slogans, towards Dongjiaomin Lane. (3) The Petition at Xu Huidong's Residence: At around 2:00 PM that day, more than 200 unarmed police officers and a platoon of military police, with more than 20 armed personnel, had already arrived inside the gate of Xu's residence at No. 1 Dongjiaomin Lane to set up a defense and maintain order. A short time later, three student representatives arrived first, claiming that they wanted to see Chairman Xu or a responsible City Councilor to respond to the students. Xu did not receive them. The main body of students ran to the front of No. 1 and charged straight towards the gate. The police and military police blocked them inside the gate, and the gate was cracked. Seeing the emergency situation, the military police fired shots into the air, and the students retreated slightly. Zhang Nairen, an officer from the 7th Precinct, was injured in the head by a brick thrown by the student crowd while trying to dissuade them. He fainted on the spot and was taken to the hospital. The pistol he was carrying was also lost on the spot (the pistol was recovered from student Wang Dayou the next day, but one bullet was missing). Since the students could not enter through the main gate, they demolished an entrance in the southeast corner of the wall of No. 1 and rushed in, throwing bricks and stones at the military police. Later, the military police fired shots into the air again, and they retreated again. The students were divided into two groups, gathering to the east and west of the gate, sitting on the ground and shouting incessantly. The two sides were deadlocked until around 5:00 PM. Zhao Changyan, the battalion commander of the search battalion of the 208th Division, arrived with two companies of troops under the order of the Garrison Headquarters. Soon, four armored vehicles from the rapid reaction force arrived, two parked in front of No. 1 and two parked to the west of the gate. The soldiers of the search battalion were deployed to the east and west of the gate of No. 1, with sentries holding submachine guns and light machine guns, facing east and west, with their muzzles pointing at the student crowd. At this time, the students pushed eighteen representatives into the courtyard to negotiate with the military police. Bai Shiwei, the deputy director of the police bureau, informed them that he would be responsible for answering the questions tomorrow and asked the student representatives to help investigate the lost pistol of officer Zhang. He said that if they could not find it today, they could find it tomorrow. He also said that he had received an order from Commander Chen to announce a curfew at 7:00 PM, and advised the students to go back temporarily and that everything would be resolved tomorrow. The students, also because of hunger, thirst, and excessive fatigue, agreed to disperse immediately. At this time, the students who gathered in the east were outside the archway, and those in the west were to the west of the No. 1 gate, about sixty meters apart, with armored vehicles and search battalion soldiers deployed in the middle.</p>
<p>The Incident</p>
<p>(3) The situation at the time the incident occurred: At around 7:00 PM, Deputy Director Bai went out to the west to persuade the students to go home. When the students were mostly standing up and preparing to form ranks, suddenly a gunshot rang out, coming from the east. Immediately afterwards, gunshots rang out, lasting for about three minutes, and then stopped briefly. Then the gunshots rang out again for one or two minutes. Deputy Director Bai stamped his feet and shouted not to shoot, but no one paid attention. At this time, the students screamed and immediately lay down. After the shooting stopped, Chen, the captain of the Bao Zheng (security and discipline) team, and the company commander of the search battalion of the 208th Division went out to stop the shooting, but many people had already been killed or injured. It was reported that two students, Wu Zhaotai and Han Delin, died on the north sidewalk outside the archway in the east, and Sun Dexin died on the left side of the road near the sidewalk. Five people died in various hospitals due to injuries, including Yang Long, Bu Hongxun, Li Fuwei, Xu Guochang, and He Shouzheng. In addition to the nineteen injured, one civilian, Zhang Fengling, died. After the incident, the injured were taken to the hospital for treatment, and the deceased were awaiting examination by the court. By 8:00 PM, the students and soldiers had all withdrawn. This is the situation before and after the July 5th incident. (To be continued.)</p>

<p>The rice market is becoming firmer because the money supply is loose and the owners of the goods do not need cash, so the intention to sell is very weak. In addition, the tin market is rising, and people's hearts are very firm. Rice shops are taking advantage of the low prices to replenish their stocks, and the sales channels are also active. North City white japonica rice is reported at 20 yuan, up 8 jiao (0.8 yuan), thin indica and early indica are up 1 yuan each, and special high japonica rice is trading at 21.8 yuan. The various stalls in the South Market are up 5 jiao each. Indica rice is relatively flat, and old rice sales in the countryside are active, up 6 to 7 jiao. Yesterday, a total of 4,429 shi (unit of dry measure) of goods arrived in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour prices are high in the interior, and there is not much stock on the market. In addition, there is a shortage of raw material wheat, which strengthens people's confidence. With the loose money supply, sales are also active. The warship brand flour immediately reached the limit of 7.26 yuan upon opening, and the market could not buy in. The old car brand flour had no transactions at the limit price of 7.57 yuan. The red bee brand flour was only one fen (0.01 yuan) away from the limit. Each increased by about 6 fen compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brand flour was limited to 7.5 yuan, and the transaction price has already reached this limit. Large bags of bran increased by 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Grains are trending firmer, and transactions are still opening at the limit price. Because the money supply is loose, the owners of the goods are reluctant to sell. Soybean oil factories are still taking in a lot, and the price is slightly firmer at the limit price. There are Yantai gangs taking in corn, pushing up the price by 5 jiao. Chongming new corn is 13 yuan, and new Mingguang red sorghum opened at 9 yuan. Northern and Southern gangs are not taking in naked barley, and transactions are sparse. Green beans and broad beans are mostly sold in small quantities, and the market is stable. Sesame sales on the street are accelerating, and the price is squeezed to the limit. The top-quality raw peanuts from Xuzhou are all transacted at the limit price, and the market is firm.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices are slightly higher. Vegetable oil has reached the limit, and transactions are quite active. Because the money supply is very loose, and it is Saturday, the appetite on the street is stronger and sales are active. The factory price for vegetable oil is 47 yuan, the limit price. Soybean oil is approaching the limit. Da You soybean oil initially opened at 51.8 yuan, and the closing price retreated to 51.6 yuan. Other soybean oils were 51.5 yuan, up 5 jiao or 1 yuan each. There are few raw oil goods available, and few are opening. There were no transactions for Jitung raw oil. Jitung raw oil was 61.3 yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil rose by 3 yuan, reaching the limit of 55 yuan. Soybean cakes are also reported at the limit price, with Lizi cakes at 4.6 yuan.</p>

<p>Since the currency reform and the circulation of Gold Yuan, the trading of securities such as Chinese and foreign stocks has also been suspended from the same day according to orders. However, government bonds continued to be bought and sold. In view of this, the municipal authorities consulted the persons in charge of the five companies in the "500 Office" yesterday and informed them that government bonds are also one of the valuable securities and cannot be an exception to Chinese and foreign stocks. They were ordered to stop trading immediately, otherwise they would be charged with illegal trading on the black market. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, government bond trading has also come to a halt. However, the municipal authorities are still paying close attention to it.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The Central Youth Department held the seventh current affairs lecture at 8:00 PM on the 27th, with legislator Huang Yuanbin lecturing on "Several Linked Focal Points of Economic Reform Plan." Huang said briefly: In the early stages of reform, it is necessary to coordinate with political power to freeze prices, and then step by step, remove the factors that may affect price increases. The following items should be effectively achieved by the government:</p>
<p>(1) Exchange and register the gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people to open up legitimate channels for floating capital. (2) The government should exempt import duties and national transportation costs on raw materials and production tools in imported goods to reduce costs. (3) Obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government to eradicate smuggling and the phenomenon of capital fleeing to Hong Kong, and at the same time facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese to absorb foreign exchange. (4) State-owned enterprises cannot raise prices. (5) Lower interest rates to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Huang continued: It is important to make good use of US aid, reorganize tax revenue, and issue government bonds to maintain a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure. This will stabilize prices, and the prospects for economic reform will be optimistic.</p>

<p>The Northeast will implement the public treasury system</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new economic plan, the national banks have removed restrictions on the allocation of funds to their counterparts, but the Northeast is an exception. The Central Bank is trying to remedy this and will have a concrete decision soon. Xia Jin Xiong, Director of the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and Wang Zhong, Director of the Northeast Region Branch, were ordered to go to the Northeast and North China respectively to inspect the actual situation and formulate effective measures. It is reported that the Central Bank plans to implement the public treasury system in the Northeast. The expenses to be paid by military and political institutions will be directly allocated by the treasury in the future, and the Central Bank will no longer be asked by the Suppression Headquarters to advance funds. After the establishment of the public treasury system, the problems of floating capital and remittances in the Northeast can be solved accordingly. The Central Bank will still adhere to the principle of guiding the floating capital in the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e112">A Glimpse of Lining Market Prices <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The standard market price of woolen fabrics remained calm yesterday, and the market atmosphere improved. This was due to the fact that the capital of various companies was gradually leveled out, the money supply was loose, and the hidden interest rate was reduced. Customers also needed to purchase goods for autumn and winter. The trend of lining silk and yarn products was generally firmer than that of woolen fabrics, and the buyers felt a little impatient, while the factory production was less than that of woolen fabrics. At the same time, calculated at pre-war market prices, the rate of increase was also less than that of woolen fabrics. Sleeve lining, foreign cloth and black carbon lining were the most attractive. Yesterday, sleeve lining was wholesaled at 1.25 to 1.5 yuan per yard, ordinary printed foreign cloth was sold at 1 yuan, black carbon lining, first grade was 4 yuan, second grade was 2.78 yuan, and third grade was 8.5 jiao. French and Western lining, gray soft lining, first grade was 8 jiao, second grade was 5 jiao, mercerized feather yarn, first grade was 1.2 yuan, second grade was 9 jiao, third grade was 6.5 fen, yarn back satin skin has not yet opened for bidding.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market continued to have limited transactions. Due to the lack of ships recently for exporters, the appetite remains unhappy. Although the trend is that the authorities are vigorously suppressing prices and people are wary, the price is constantly soaring, and the cost of reproduction is rising sharply, resulting in a meander higher in the market. However, insiders said that at this price, there is little profit. Therefore, the current industry is quite concerned and hopes that the salt area tea price will lead downstream. As for domestic floral varieties, they are all flat.</p>

As a last resort, restrictions have been placed on customer withdrawals of small-denomination banknotes below 2,000 yuan, which has led to many merchants refusing to use small banknotes.

<h3 id="e117">Export Control Commission Announces Export Situation for the Week: Hankou Bristles Profitable, Tianjin Bristles Lose Money <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Export Control Commission announced yesterday the overseas market conditions and foreign exchange settlement of exported goods last week as follows:</p>
<p>In the first half of this week (August 16th to 21st), rumors were rife domestically that a new economic plan would soon be implemented. Most industries adopted a wait-and-see approach, and prices fluctuated. Exported goods generally showed a downward trend, with the index increasing by about 25% compared to last week. Overseas market conditions were generally stable, except for slight increases in duck feathers, sesame seeds, rapeseed, and cottonseed cake, and decreases in soybeans, broad beans, and vegetable oil. Based on the initial domestic and foreign market prices of the week, Shanghai and Hankou's hog bristles, feathers, sausage casings, egg products, raw hides, tea, gallnuts, and other exports were profitable. However, tung oil, Tianjin hog bristles, bean seeds, edible oil, raw silk, and Chinese medicine had slight losses. The largest loss was for Tianjin's No. 55 long bristles, with a price difference of 42%. On Friday, after the government explicitly announced the currency reform, the export industry had a good response. The exchange rate between the gold yuan and the U.S. dollar had been rigidly set at a ratio of four to one, and price variations are expected to be eliminated. The overseas market conditions for exported goods this week are briefly described below:</p>
<p>The initial overseas price of tung oil this week, F.O.B. was still 17.25 cents per pound in U.S. dollars. Due to a 25% increase in domestic market prices, the price difference loss increased to 24%. At the end of the week, a telegram from London stated that British importers' buying price was £146 per ton for bulk and £154 per ton for barrelled oil. Tung oil exports this week were still not enthusiastic, with many shipments to Hong Kong. Due to sufficient inventory in Hong Kong, prices are expected to fall. It is recently rumored that American experts have discovered new uses for tung oil, such as building airports, so the proportion of tung oil in military industries will increase, and future market conditions may be promising.</p>
<p>Hog bristles: The F.O.B. prices per pound for Hankou No. 17, Shanghai No. 17, Tianjin long No. 55, short No. 55, and No. 26 were $4.70, $2.30, $7.00, $6.35, and $4.95 in U.S. dollars respectively. Based on the initial exchange settlement price of the week, Shanghai and Hankou bristles could make profits of 13% and 54% respectively, while Tianjin bristles suffered losses.</p>
<p>Tea: Arrivals are still scarce. Green teas such as Chun Mee, which sell well in North Africa, are expected to increase in price by foreign merchants, and the market conditions have improved slightly. At the beginning of the week, the E.O.B. prices per pound for Keemun black tea and Tunxi green tea were 25 cents and 30 cents in U.S. dollars respectively. Exports were profitable, with the latter exceeding 10%. However, due to empty inventories, transactions were not numerous.</p>
<p>Raw silk: There was no change in overseas prices. Shanghai F.O.B. price for D-grade raw silk was $2.80 per pound. According to a silk authority who recently returned from Europe, due to insufficient silk weaving production capacity, European raw silk prices have fallen from $11 per pound after the war to $2.6 per pound. This price is obviously too low, and there may be a sharp rise in the future. Through the efforts of the International Raw Silk Conference, future raw silk production will be coordinated with silk inventory and consumption to take into account the interests of both raw silk merchants and silk weaving merchants. Therefore, the prices will certainly be better than the current situation in the future. Moreover, raw silk still has many excellent characteristics and will maintain its position in the international market.</p>
<p>Feathers: Among feathers, the overseas price of duck feathers has improved. This week's F.O.B. price was $0.435 per pound, and the O.I.F. price was $0.45 per pound. The F.O.B. price of goose feathers was still $0.535 per pound. Exports were profitable, with price differences of 35% and 16% respectively.</p>
<p>Sausage casings: The overseas market price remained unchanged at $75 F.O.B. Exports had a profit of 27%. It is reported that New York sausage casing prices have fallen, and the production of finished products in 27-yard packages originally sold there has been discontinued and is being converted to 13.5-yard packages for export to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Bean market: Overseas prices have fallen. The Hong Kong price of Hankou soybeans was 40 Hong Kong dollars per picul, and there are still reports of competitive sales. The overseas price of edible oil has also fallen. The Guangzhou export oil market is sluggish due to continuous low quotations in Hong Kong dollars. At the end of the week, a telegram from London stated that the selling price of barrelled rapeseed oil C&amp;F was £135 per ton. Oilseeds rose slightly overseas. At the end of the week, the London buying price for mainland peanuts was $295 C&amp;F per ton.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth: The overseas market remained stable. At the beginning of the week, the Hong Kong price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 20.20 Hong Kong dollars per piece. The price of high-quality cotton cloth was $10.5 per bolt, barely covering the cost of export. As for the export volume of cotton cloth, it has exceeded 200,000 bolts in June and July. Recently, with the Dutch authorities opening several ports in the Indonesian region, the cotton cloth market in that region is expected to develop.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Mayor Convened Education Groups Yesterday to Agree on Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees Standards for Public and Private Schools: Municipal Primary Schools 12 Yuan, Junior High 21 Yuan, Senior High 25 Yuan; Private Schools Primary 20-30 Yuan, Junior High 35-50 Yuan, Senior High 45-60 Yuan <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The fee standards for public and private primary and secondary schools in this city have been decided as follows: (1) Private schools: Primary schools 20-30 gold yuan, junior high schools 35-50 gold yuan, senior high schools 45-60 gold yuan. These standards include tuition and miscellaneous fees, and each school can set its own fee based on its environment within this range. (2) Municipal schools: Primary schools 12 gold yuan, junior high schools 21 gold yuan, senior high schools 25 gold yuan. These include tuition, miscellaneous fees, teacher training fees, sports fees, and maintenance fees. (Primary schools do not charge tuition fees.)</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau held separate talks with the principals of public and private primary and secondary schools some days ago to discuss the issue of fees for this semester and listen to their opinions. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu personally invited relevant education groups to a symposium in the City Government conference room to discuss tuition fees. More than 40 representatives from units such as the Municipal Education Association, the Private Primary and Secondary School Joint Association, the Private Secondary Education Staff Friendship Association, the Municipal Secondary Education Staff Friendship Association, the Municipal Primary School Principal Friendship Association, the Municipal Primary Education Staff Friendship Association, and the Private Primary Education Staff Friendship Association attended. Li, the acting director of the Education Bureau, also attended.</p>
<p>Private Schools</p>
<p>The discussion began with the fees for private schools. The amounts proposed by the principals of various private schools were 30-40 gold yuan for primary schools, 50-60 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 70-80 gold yuan for senior high schools. The Education Bureau believed that they should be reduced to 20-25 gold yuan for primary schools, 35-45 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 45-55 gold yuan for senior high schools. Mayor Wu, after calculating based on the principle that private school teachers should receive the same treatment as municipal school teachers, believed that the amounts reduced by the Education Bureau were acceptable. The principals of various schools then pleaded with the mayor, and the mayor said: "The current situation is not good, and the people's ability to bear the burden is poor. It is impossible to restore the fee standards to the pre-war level. If the fee standards are set low today, the schools will have difficulties maintaining them, but if they are set too high, they will inevitably be criticized by public opinion. The city government can only try to find a balance, striving for fairness so that the schools can be stable, the teachers can maintain their livelihoods, and the people can afford it." Shen Tongyi, the principal of Nanyang Model School, immediately asked the mayor what would happen if the schools could not maintain themselves if they charged fees according to the standards proposed by the Education Bureau. The mayor replied that the board of directors should be asked to make up for the funds. If the schools want to increase teachers' salaries, they should also ask the board of directors for assistance and not increase fees. He also said, "You may not take into account the burden on the citizens, but the city government must." After a long debate, the mayor finally accepted the suggestion of Zhou Feicheng of the Municipal Education Association and widened the range, deciding that it would be 20-30 gold yuan for primary schools, 35-50 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 45-60 gold yuan for senior high schools.</p>
<p>Municipal Schools</p>
<p>The discussion then turned to the fees for municipal schools, and the private school representatives who attended all withdrew. The principals of municipal schools requested 18.7 gold yuan for primary schools, 28 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 32 gold yuan for senior high schools. The Education Bureau believed that, based on the previous semester's fees and the ratio of prices, primary schools should charge 11 gold yuan, junior high schools 21 gold yuan, and senior high schools 25 gold yuan. After discussion, it was finally decided that primary schools would charge 12 gold yuan (including 6 gold yuan for teacher training fees, 1 gold yuan for sports fees, 2 gold yuan for maintenance fees, and 3 gold yuan for construction fees). Junior high schools will charge 21 gold yuan (including 10 gold yuan for teacher training fees, 1 gold yuan for tuition fees, and 10 gold yuan for other sports fees, miscellaneous fees, and construction fees, with the distribution ratio to be decided at a meeting of school principals). Senior high schools will charge 25 gold yuan (including 12 gold yuan for teacher training fees, 1 gold yuan for tuition fees, and 12 gold yuan for other sports fees, miscellaneous fees, and construction fees, with the distribution ratio to be decided by the principals).</p>

<p>[Central News Agency] Zhou Jiaoqing and 156 other student parents in Shanghai issued a telegram on Teachers' Day, stating: "As we celebrate Teachers' Day, we, as parents, feel the dignity of the teaching profession and remember the hard work of teaching. We would like to extend our highest respect to teachers nationwide. At this time when the country is facing many difficulties and needs talents for national construction, we are looking forward to promoting the teaching profession, cultivating talents, and giving full play to the effectiveness of education to save the country. However, the communist rebellion is rampant. It is not only engaging in military aggression in the front line, but also disrupting the rear, employing professional students to infiltrate schools, regarding schools as concessions, and using reading places as a base for communist plots, and then as a base for riots. The rules of the school have been abandoned, and the order of society has been destroyed. Not only that, but a small number of teachers who claim to be progressive not only do not admonish sincerely, but also echo in harmony, and even collude with the communists, agitating and bewitching young people, so that professional students become more and more arrogant; and pure young people are angry and dare not speak out. This not only tarnishes the teaching profession, but also loses the children of others. Now that the government has issued an order to eliminate communist plots in order to stabilize order, summoned professional students, and implemented the national policy of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, all patriotic compatriots should sincerely support it, and we deeply hope that people in the education sector will strictly rectify the ranks, and the government authorities should handle it strictly according to law. Eliminate communist plots and rectify the academic atmosphere. We are heartbroken by the communist disaster and hope for peace. We hope that our children will become talents and that teachers will shoulder the heavy responsibility of cultivating people. Therefore, we offer our foolish sincerity and send a telegram to the whole country, hoping that parents all over the world will speak out in unison."</p>

<h3 id="e123">The Ministry of Education Plans to Improve Secondary Education: Selectively Subsidize Model Secondary Schools; The Amount Will Be Determined Based on the Situation of Secondary Schools in Each Province and City <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing on the 28th] In order to improve the level of secondary schools and the professional standards and treatment of teachers, the Ministry of Education has recently planned to select public secondary schools with better foundations in various provinces and cities and provide subsidies to enable them to play a model role, in order to gradually improve the standards of secondary school education facilities and the level of secondary school students. Regarding the improvement of the treatment of secondary school teachers, the Ministry of Education formulated the salary standards for faculty and staff of national secondary schools in 1944 and issued them to various provinces and cities, referring to the salary standards to formulate the general salary standards for faculty and staff of secondary schools in each province and city, and has repeatedly supervised the implementation of the standards over the years. In the future, the number of model secondary schools in each province and city will be determined based on the number of schools reported by each province and city and the education situation in each province and city. As for the stock of equipment, teaching, and student levels of model secondary schools, etc., because China is vast and the financial resources, human resources, and education levels of each province and city are not the same, the Ministry of Education does not have mandatory standards.</p>

<p>— Zhong Zhen, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Special Cable from Our Newspaper in London] On August 1st (Sunday), at 8:00 PM on the third day after the opening of the World Games, the Sunday Pictorial, on behalf of the British Information Office, hosted a banquet at the luxurious Dorchester Hotel in London for journalists from various countries participating in the World Games. Approximately 400 people attended, representing 49 different countries. Only one special correspondent from our newspaper was invited from our country. The traffic was heavy that day, and the event was a great success.</p>
<p>The distinguished guests included the British Minister of Health, Mr. Bevan, and the Chairman of the current Olympic "Preparatory Committee," the Duke of Burghley. The Duke gave a speech in which he reported on the progress and difficulties of the preparations for the Games and expressed the hope that international cooperation would be strengthened through the Games. Duke Burghley was a famous British track and field athlete twenty years ago. He participated in the 10th Olympic World Games in Los Angeles, USA in 1932 and won the 400-meter hurdles championship. He is a veteran of the sports world, and his selection as chairman this time was not accidental. His speech was humorous and his demeanor was excellent. Afterwards, Mr. Hugh Cudliop, editor-in-chief of the Sunday Pictorial, rose to deliver a congratulatory speech to the guests and used various languages to say "Welcome," according to the alphabetical order of the country names in English, and the reporters from each country stood up and thanked him in their own language. This kind of welcoming ceremony was truly unique and full of interest. The food was abundant, and there was champagne and fine wine, a rare feast in post-war Britain. In addition, international singers (Viera) and famous pianists performed, and the guests and hosts dispersed happily at twelve o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e137">On Wine-Telling and Tao Qian <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Bin</p>
<p>Regarding the time of Tao Yuanming's works, since the Song Dynasty, he only used the year of the Jiazi cycle without writing the reign title. His loyalty to the old country has long been praised. This discovery was first recorded in the "Annotations of the Five Ministers of the Selections of Literature," which states: "Tao Yuanming's poems written during the Jin Dynasty all include the reign title, while those written during the Song Dynasty only include the year of the Jiazi cycle. It is thought that he was ashamed to serve two dynasties, so he differentiated them in this way."</p>
<p>However, Yuanming's use of the Jiazi cycle to record time did not begin with the Song Dynasty. Before the Yixi era (405-419), he occasionally only used the Jiazi cycle, but after the Liu Song Dynasty, he completely omitted the reign title. Although this is a minor detail, it shows Tao's attitude towards the ugly abdication drama of the time.</p>
<p>In fact, Tao Qian had long foreseen the fate of the weak Jin dynasty and its demise. The warlords, such as Liu Yu and Huan Xuan, were rampant, and the hope of restoration had been extinguished. Therefore, Yuanming himself had long expressed the lament of "admiring all things for gaining their time and feeling that my life is coming to an end." He expressed this worry in many of his works, but previous people did not pay much attention to it. For example, when Yin Jingren went to serve as a staff officer under Liu Yu (when Liu was still Grand Commandant), Yuanming wrote in his farewell poem, "Good talents do not hide in the world, rivers and lakes are full of mean and poor people," which shows that his usual complaints were not insignificant!</p>
<p>Tao Qian's most concrete reflection on Liu Yu's usurpation of the Jin dynasty is none other than the poem "Telling of Wine." Although this poem uses wine to confuse the truth, a careful reading reveals his inner anger and his unforgettable feelings for the Jin dynasty. I will copy it down below:</p>
<p>"The double sun illuminates the southern land, the cries of crows are heard together. Although the autumn grass is not yet yellow, the gentle wind has long been divided. White pebbles adorn the clear shores, and the southern peaks are without remaining clouds. Yuzhang rises against the tall gates, and Chonghua's tomb is firmly established. Tears flow as I embrace my inner sighs, and I listen attentively to the rooster crowing. The divine land offers fine grain, and the western spirits instruct me. The princes of Liang controlled the armies, and the taro harvest cost them their lives. The Prince of Shanyang returned to a lesser state, and achieving fame was still not diligent. Bu Sheng was good at tending his flock, and found happiness in not being a ruler. King Ping left the old capital, and gathered the remaining partisans in the gorge. Double tombs were just being built, and three toes revealed a strange writing. Prince Ai loved the clear flute, and soared in the daytime over the He and Fen rivers. Lord Zhu practiced the nine teeth, and lived in seclusion away from the world's turmoil. Lofty within the western peaks, I always rest in familiar places. Heaven's countenance is eternally fixed, and Peng's longevity is not worthy of comparison."</p>
<p>The opening section of this poem, focusing on the beauty of the scenery, is not unusual. But when it comes to the two lines "Yuzhang rises against the tall gates, and Chonghua's tomb is interspersed with spirits," the condemnation of Emperor Gong's abdication flows forth like a river, once unleashed, impossible to restrain.</p>
<p>History records that after Liu Yu usurped the Jin dynasty, he deposed Emperor Gong as the Prince of Lingling. The following year, he instructed Zhang Wei to give him poisoned wine. Wei could not bear to harm the former ruler and drank the poison himself. Yu then sent troops to advance the poison, but Emperor Gong refused it and was subsequently killed.</p>
<p>Tang Dongjian once said that Yuanming's "Telling of Wine" was a lament for Emperor Gong, which is undoubtedly correct. In the poem, "The Prince of Shanyang returned to a lesser state" uses the story of Emperor Xian of Han to allude to current events, and the fates of Emperor Xian of Han and Emperor Gong of Jin were completely similar. After Cao Wei usurped the Han, Emperor Xian was demoted to Duke of Shanyang and eventually assassinated. Liu Yu's treatment of Emperor Gong followed the same method used by Cao Pi. The cyclical tragedy of history made the one-man scholar Tao Yuanming only able to "shed tears and embrace his inner sighs."</p>
<p>Huang Shangu has questioned the topic of "Telling of Wine", but if one knows the story above, it becomes clear that the "wine" in "Telling of Wine" is the poisoned wine that poisoned Emperor Gong, which has no relation to "Yi Di made it, and Du Kang refined it." Moreover, Yuanming put a lot of effort into thinking up such a topic!</p>
<p>Yuanming was born in a turbulent world and was the son of a declining aristocratic family. His feelings were naturally deeper than those of others. However, in a chaotic world, it is difficult to speak one's mind, especially during a change of dynasties. To express one's complaints often leads to losing one's head. During the transition between the Wei and Jin dynasties, harming men of letters seemed to be something the rulers enjoyed. Tao Qian grew up in such an environment, so how could he not be cautious and fearful? Therefore, in his works, he sometimes hides his true feelings severely. Only in his hidden feelings are there occasional touches of inner feelings and profound grief, such as "The trees are joyfully facing the sun, and the streams are flowing slowly," such as "Xingtian defies with majesty, his fierce will remains constant," such as "Wading along the banks of the Yangtze River... Suddenly the mountains and rivers changed," and the "Telling of Wine" and "Yin-An Farewell" mentioned above, everywhere one can see that Tao's inner life and his outward appearance were in extremely fierce conflict. However, Yuanming's strength lies in his ability to reconcile this contradiction. He was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Laozi and Zhuangzi, so he was less concerned with gain and loss. For example, after the fall of the Jin dynasty, Yuanming had a sense of grief and sorrow like that expressed in "Telling of Wine," but he suppressed it, knowing that he himself did not have the power to recruit troops and buy horses, so empty and lofty expressions of integrity were unnecessary. For example, Tao's friendship with the high-ranking monk Huiyuan was unmatched at the time, but Yuanming never joined the White Lotus Society, which shows that in the midst of chaos, he only wanted to refrain from certain things and maintain his own integrity.</p>
<p>In this era of frequent changes, whenever I think of Yuanming's high-mindedness and detachment, refusing to be involved in worldly affairs, and then look at today, those who indulge in licentiousness and extravagance, doing everything, are numerous, I increasingly feel that maintaining one's own integrity is valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Tai Chi Chuan Arrives in Taiwan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>My brother, Weiming, recently returned from Taiwan and talked about the people there learning Tai Chi Chuan. There is value in recording it.</p>
<p>The Japanese occupied Taiwan for fifty years. Their own people practiced Judo, but they prohibited the Taiwanese from exercising and did not allow the organization of martial arts groups. After the victory, Xie Jinghu of Hsinchu City, Taiwan, a disciple of Weiming, established a Tai Chi Chuan club in the Zheng Clan Ancestral Hall. More than twenty people studied with him. Zhou Minyi, who had come to Shanghai in the past to learn boxing from Weiming for five or six years, also joined. The two sent letters inviting Weiming to tour Taiwan Province, and remitted a sum of one hundred million yuan as travel expenses. Weiming flew to Taiwan on June 24th. When he arrived in Hsinchu, Zhou and Xie held a meeting to welcome him. Previously, Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily had published the news that "Shanghai Tai Chi Chuan Master Chen Weiming is coming to Taiwan." At the welcoming meeting, about two hundred people who had heard the news came to observe. First, Xie Jinghu's students performed, then Chen Duoming performed Tai Chi Chuan, and Xu Wenfuf performed Shaolin boxing, Tai Chi sword, and double knives (the two are Weiming's top disciples, who flew to Taiwan at the same time), which was extremely exciting. My brother Weiming performed Tai Chi Changquan and Baguazhang, and also performed moving-step push hands with Duoming, which the Taiwanese had never seen before, and they applauded endlessly. Some guests who practiced external martial arts were also invited to perform. After the performance, they went inside to rest, but the visitors did not disperse. A certain boxer requested a hand-to-hand match. Weiming came out and said to the crowd, "I am here purely for sightseeing, not to compete. If you insist on a hand-to-hand match, we can study together." A certain gentleman immediately stepped forward, his body strong and sturdy. Weiming extended his right hand in a posture without striking. The gentleman suddenly grabbed Weiming's right arm, trying to drag him down. His strength was extremely great. Weiming followed him for several steps, and the gentleman's strength had quietly disappeared. Then he gently touched the gentleman's eyes with his left hand, merely indicating his intention. However, the gentleman did not understand the subtleties of internal martial arts and continued to hold Weiming's right arm tightly. Weiming slightly shook his right arm, and the man was shocked, retreating seven or eight steps, almost falling. The crowd who came to watch were finally convinced and dispersed with applause. After this meeting, Weiming's name as a national martial arts master spread throughout Taiwan. Someone from Northern Taiwan wrote a letter inviting Weiming to teach boxing, but Weiming declined because he wanted to return to Shanghai and did not have time.</p>
<p>Weiming founded the Zhi Rou Boxing Club in Shanghai in 1925, and was the earliest to promote Tai Chi Chuan in the South. It still exists today, and the club is located in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road. Over the past twenty years, those who have studied Tai Chi with him have been numerous. For example, celebrities such as Xu Shiying and the late Xie Te, Wu Chaochu, Huang Fu, Hu Puan, and Guan Jiong, were all his disciples. In 1932, Generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi specially invited him to Guangxi to teach boxing. The people of Guangxi knew about Tai Chi Chuan since Weiming began promoting it. Now he has given the Taiwanese a new impression of Tai Chi Chuan, and it must be recorded.</p>

<p>When the young Herbert Hoover was still studying at Stanford University, he organized a concert and invited the renowned Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski to perform for a high fee. However, the audience was not enthusiastic, and the young concert organizer Hoover found that he was four hundred US dollars short to pay the pianist. Paderewski generously cancelled the four hundred dollar debt.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years later, the Poles held a grand public reception in Łódź to welcome the visiting Hoover. At that time, Paderewski had been elected President of Poland. He thanked the Americans for saving the lives of countless Poles under Hoover's relief work. Hoover replied that he was merely repaying an old debt of four hundred US dollars.</p>

<p>Dana Baine is one of the highest-paid stars in American radio broadcasting - but he hardly needs to speak.</p>
<p>He specializes in imitating the sounds of various animals, and he has a slogan: "From mosquitoes to elephants, I can imitate everything." He can imitate more than a hundred bird calls, the sounds of various livestock, and also the different "hissing" sounds of various insects and snakes.</p>
<p>He gets paid $35 for imitating a chicken for three seconds. Once he got $98 for imitating ten cat meows. The strangest time was when he had to imitate the sound of a person's upper and lower teeth colliding when startled. It is said that he imitated it very well.</p>

<p>American thieves seem to have changed their style lately. Incidents of wanting money and making jokes at the same time are becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>A newly opened restaurant in Brooklyn was broken into by thieves at night, who stole the two hundred and forty dollars stored in the safe. When the owner discovered the theft and was about to call the police, he saw that someone had added a few hasty words to the large poster in the store that read "Choose what you like, satisfaction guaranteed": "Already taken care of, thank you for your kindness."</p>
<p>There is a small thief in Kansas City who specializes in sneaking into people's homes at night to steal. This person has a characteristic: every time he steals something, he always scatters many thumbtacks on the floor. If the owners hear the noise and get up to chase him barefoot, they are sure to step on the thumbtacks - when they scream in pain, the little thief can slip away quietly.</p>
<p>One night in a wine bar in downtown New York, two fierce-looking bandits came in. They showed their guns, and one herded the owner and seven customers into a corner, while the other went to the counter and put all the money in his pocket. Then, he jumped on the table, bowed to the customers, and asked, "Gentlemen, what would you like to drink?" The customers were so frightened that they had turned pale, and had no interest in drinking, but with the guns pointed at them, they dared not disobey and ordered a kind of wine. One of the two robbers then started pouring the wine, singing a melodious love song, while the other robber started toe-dancing. When the two robbers had had their fill, they sang together and left.</p>
<p>In Tulsa, two drivers were arguing on the road over a minor matter. Two policemen came and took them to court. The judge fined them sixty-five dollars. Later, the two people found out that the policemen and the judge were actually imposters.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Surviving Writings of Shen Yunying <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Yesterday, Rong De, from Wuxi, showed me two frames of calligraphy by the extraordinary woman Shen Yunying of Xiaoshan, who lived at the end of the Ming Dynasty. One is a copy of the "Essay on Yue Yi," with only forty-seven characters remaining. It was written in the mid-autumn of the Chongzhen wuyin year (1638), six years before Li Zicheng attacked the capital. It was probably a casual creation while she was still attending her father (Zhi Xu) as a guard in Daozhou. It ends with a white text seal "Yunying Learns Calligraphy" and a red text seal "Shen Family's Daughter" on each side. The other page contains works expressing her feelings after returning to seclusion in her hometown. Although there are only a few hundred words, they can be compared to a painful history. One poem reads: "Looking back on all things, they are like passing waves. What has come of studying writing and swordsmanship? Daozhou has not been broken, but Jingzhou has fallen. I regret that I cannot be like Xie Xiao'e!" The second poem reads: "Returning to the long lane, my mind is lost! In my worn box, I find only a few remaining notes. What does this humble brush matter? It has been twelve years since the fires of war." The following is an appendix: "When I was attending in Daozhou, I used to copy this book. Until after the guiwu year, the bandits held up their spears. I could not hold the brush. Years of war and thousands of miles of travel, who was my companion? This year, it is the gengyin year. The world has completely changed, but the people and the books remain the same. Looking at this book, I cannot restrain my grief. My nephew Zhaoyang came to ask about writing, so I recorded these two quatrains to show him. Zhaoyang must work hard!" The end of the note is not signed, but it is marked with two small seals, "Aying" and "Returning from the Battlefield." It was five or six years since Zhi Xu died in battle at Matan Station and her husband Jia Wance died in Jingzhou. According to the epitaph written by Mao Qiling, Yunying returned to her hometown and supported herself by teaching embroidery and copying books. She lived a simple life and died at the young age of thirty-eight, buried in Jushan. There is a passage about Shen Zhaoyang: "Mao Sheng from Xihe has a friend named Shen Zhaoyang, a scholar, who is a member of the general's (referring to Yunying) clan. He once received the Commentary of Mr. Hu on the Spring and Autumn Annals from the general." Therefore, the source of this note can be said to be credible. During the Xianfeng reign, Ding Dachun also had a detailed inscription, prefacing the beginning and end: "In the xinhai year of the Xianfeng reign, I happened to be a guest in Yuanjiang and met Jiang Huisheng, an old painter from Suzhou, who was carrying the general's handwriting for sale. It was the household collection of the Shen Zhaoyang, a famous scholar mentioned in Mao's epitaph, which had been in his family for five generations. Jiang Jun bought it for thirty gold, hoping to give it to Commander Lu Lifu, but Lu was censured for losing military secrets. I then added twenty gold and obtained it." From Xianfeng and Tongzhi to the present, it has been hundreds of years, and I do not know how many people have lingered and sighed in between before it returned to Rong Jun. I have already decided to write a long poem and encourage you to take photos and make prints to spread it widely. (Editor's note: Mr. Shi's long poem will be published tomorrow.)</p>
