<h3>敬向上海市民進一言</h3>
<p>— 蔣經國</p>
<p>近十幾天來，一般人心，因爲受了市場波動的影響，大都感覺到不安定，我也承認，目前的情況，的確是一個重大的難關。在九月十二日那天，我曾向上海市民說過，上海經濟管制的前途，並不是風平浪靜，月白風清的景緻，而是一種困難重重的艱苦工作，現在眞已遭遇着這樣的關頭了，這也是我們所意料得到的事情。</p>
<p>大家請平心靜氣的想一想，上海在上一個月的生產量，除了少數較小規模的工廠，因缺乏原料而減工以外，一般的生產，尤其是日用必需品的生產，除　粉業外，並未爲之減少；全國農村的年成，今年大都是豐收。金圓劵發行數量的增加，雖然是足以刺激物價的上漲，但同時金圓劵的保證準備金，亦已增強。現在的不安，看來還是在於人爲的因素居多。自從政府命令兌換金鈔以來，一般市民，因爲換得了大量的金圓劵，這自然使人民的購買力也大爲增強起來。例如舉永安公司營業情形來說，八月十七日銷貨價值，計金圓劵一一·八七九圓；八月三十日增加到二八·〇一五圓；九月十五日增加到八五·七四五圓；十月十日則更增加到一一一·七一四圓。從這些數目字，可以看出，金鈔的兌換與購買力的增強，已發生直接的關係。現在上海的貨品，是否已賣完呢？絕對不是的。再舉永安公司來說，九月份銷貨總數爲金圓劵一，五四二·〇九四圓，進貨的數目爲一，一六四·七六〇圓，兩數相差，是有限的，但假使將其存貨計算在內，這個數量一定要超過每月進貨數量好幾倍；以十月份例子來說，十月八日一天，計銷貨八二·〇〇〇圓，而進貨亦達七二·〇〇〇圓，雖然進貨數量不能與銷貨數量相等，但假使幾年以來的存貨，這決不至有任何恐慌的。永安公司不過是一個例子而已，一般商人，喧嚷着貨已賣光，其實少數商店或則有之，但一般的說來，各縣各店存貨決不缺乏；再舉例來說，例如複製業上月所配給的紗，數量與前月仍是一樣，棉布存額在十月一日有六七八萬疋十月廿日存量尚有六五八萬疋，這樣，各種棉織生產品，決不至有所減少。所以我們可以確實相信，上海並非無貨應市，而是商人看漲，不願將存貨拿出來，以致造成今天的所謂缺貨現象。今後我們必須要他們將貨物拿出來，照限價供應市場，老實說，這一部份貨品所用的原料，均係八一九前進的，政府苦心苦意使着公用事業及日用必需品維持限價，爲的是使工資不發生變化，旣然用的是「八一九」的原料，「八一九」的工資，試問又有何種理由不照「八一九」限價出賣貨品呢？我們舉目前布的生產情況來說，一疋斜紋布，除了配給紗價，薪津，工資，電費及其他成本項目外，如照八一九限價出售，每疋布尚可賺得一圓八角，這樣看來，一般廠商，並沒有虧本的現象。自然，如果現在將所有的貨物，完全供應市場，當會發生搶購，因爲上海價格比各地要低，但等到下月，每一上海市民取得購物證時，在限購制度下，就再用不着恐懼所謂單幫之類的商人來搶購了。那時我們無論批發商，零售商，或廠商，就非拿出存貨不行，在必要的時候，一部份貨品，將由政府收購，推銷各地，以便換取上海所需農產原料和食糧。（下轉第四版）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>聯合國日感言</h3>
<p>今天是「聯合國日」，全世界五十八國的億兆人民，都在那裏熱烈慶祝祈禱和平，流露出人類忠心愛護聯合國機構的赤忱。大家心中雖都明白，聯合國的基礎建立在列強的「意見一致」上，它能不能發揮其維持世界和平的功效，要看今日列強能不能團結合作，但無論如何，聯合國至今仍不失為「一個世界」的象徵，它依然是人類對於世界和平的唯一希望。今日世界雖在兩極化的洪流中，但我們欣逢聯合國的誕辰，對於聯合國的前途，仍抱着無限的希望。</p>
<p>聯合國的萌芽，始於一九四二年元旦的「聯合國宣言」。那時太平洋戰爭爆發未久，德軍在蘇聯境內長驅直入，可謂人類最黑暗的時代，聯合國有無戰勝的希望，更是渺芒得很。因此，聯合國發表宣言，一方面公開宣佈聯合國的作戰目標，一方面呼籲各國併肩作戰到底，決不可與軸心國單獨媾和。從此這個聯合國的思想逐漸發展，到了一九四三年十月莫斯科三國外長會議時，中·英·美·蘇四國即發表了一個「四國普遍安全宣言」，顯示出四強保證戰後集體安全的決心，實可謂聯合國憲章的前身。其後聯合國在軍事上逐漸占優勢，預料離開全面勝利為期不遠，中·英·美·蘇四國代表又在美國鄧巴頓橡園開會，替今日的聯合國機構畫出了一個「藍圖」。一九四五年四月廿五日舊金山會議通過了聯合國憲章，於是聯合國機構也就呱呱　地了。</p>
<p>所以，從聯合國誕生的經過看來，不難明瞭聯合國的意義。簡言之：在戰時，聯合國要靠各國的通力合作羸得軍事的勝利；到了勝利之後，還要靠各國以同樣的精神團結一致，共同締造世界和平。我們回頭看看七八年來聯合國的成長，聯合國不僅已替人類獲得光榮的勝利，而且也已為世界和平奠定了一個鞏固的始基。目前的國際形勢，雖與聯合國的宗旨似乎背道而馳，走向分裂途徑；但就事實論，聯合國的成就究竟是難能而可貴的。目前聯合國雖因柏林問題面臨一嚴重的考驗，但人類的良知必能使聯合國安然渡過這重難關，成為維持世界和平真正有效的國際機構。</p>
<p>聯合國憲章，自一九四五年十一月二十四日正式生效之後，已經開過三次大會。平心而論，聯合國確曾替國際間消滅了不少仇恨，爭議與戰禍，尤其是安全理事會，成功多於失敗。以事實來說，安理會的成功有下列各項：（一）盟國駐在伊朗·敘利亞·黎巴　三國軍隊的撤退，使三國問題和平解決；（二）調處印度尼西亞的「荷印衝突」，使印尼九千萬人免於戰禍；（三）和解印度的「印回之爭」，使印度與巴基斯坦四億人民，免於內戰的浩刧；（四）調停巴勒斯坦的「猶阿之戰」，停戰令終為雙方所接受；（五）對於希臘的內戰，聯合國派員調查和調處，卒使巴爾幹半島的形勢趨於緩和。這些成就都是從艱難困苦中得來的，在我們慶祝聯合國誕辰的今日，不能不大書特書，特別珍惜與愛護。</p>
<p>但從另一方面去觀察，我們又不得不替聯合國的前途擔憂。在第一次聯合國大會中，就暴露出列強意見的分歧；一九四七年第二次聯合國大會，蘇聯代表維辛斯基竟在會場中，公然指斥美國要人為「戰爭販子」；現在第三次大會正在巴黎夏樂宮中舉行，為了柏林封鎖問題，蘇聯與西方盟國爭論未已，使大家都在那裏惶恐憂懼，不知聯合國能否通過這一嚴重的考驗。</p>
<p>然而，我們始終認為聯合國的成功，要靠國際間的合作與團結，尤其是美蘇二國間的互忍互讓。今天是聯合國日，世界各國都在那裏慶祝，我們希望列強的政治外交家，都能在這一天深切反省，大家要以真誠來擁護聯合國，放棄「小異」，遷就「大同」，力謀列強意見的一致，從而促進國際間的團結與合作。如此，不僅任何國際糾紛都不難獲致和平解決的方案，而且聯合國也就有它美麗的遠景了。</p>

<h3>聯大政治委員會決定　聖地問題展緩辯論　蘇聯集團反對終於無效　美國考慮對以色列貸款</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕聯大政治委員會廿三日以十九對十六票，另十四國棄權，表決通過巴勒斯坦問題辯論展期一星期。美國投展期票，英國棄權，法國反對展期。波蘭代表喀茲蘇契立卽攻擊美國運用『政治手腕」，圖使聯大在美國大選於十一月二日舉行前，不能考慮巴勒斯坦局勢。按本週延展討論聖地案已有二次。政委會今日開會時，一致無異議同意討論巴勒斯坦，然因准許巴勒斯坦高級委員會派員以列席者身份來會一點，引起程序辯論，會議遂無法進展。經一小時討論後，伊朗代表恩迪善遂建議展期，以一週時間考慮高級委員會之由請。蘇聯集團雖大呼「政治手段」，該會卒通過展期。喀茲蘇契斥伊期之理由為「微弱之藉口」，又稱，眞正之原因悉為「政治性」的。主席史巴克乃阻止他人發言，而免於延長辯論。渠稱，該會將於廿五日重開，審查裁軍小組會之報吿書，其後再討論希臘問題，至是乃宣告散會。</p>

<h3>警上海市民進一言　蔣經國　上接第一版</h3>
<p>至於講到日用必需品，如油·米·糖·麵粉四種物品，現在很多人感覺購買時須排隊而不方便，但我以為這種不方便的發生，可以說一部份是由市民自已造出來的。比如糖·油在上海存量，就是不再生產，不再進口，也足够三四月之用，何况現在仍繼續生產和進口。在本月初，許多市民本來是一斤一斤的買，而現在却要一包一包一桶一桶的買了，假使大家都能以自已需要多少，卽買多少，那末政府又何必加以限制。但是現在的情形，如不加以限制，則四個月的存量，恐怕四五日卽被有錢的人賣完，結果就要引起糖荒和油荒。麵粉也是如此，因為小麥來源不豐，所以麵粉的出產亦少，不過我可以說，現在上海麵粉存量，至少足够一月之用，但如不加限制，不實行配給制度，則一個月的存量，恐怕不及二三天也就要賣完了，那時卽油條燒餅亦不可得。目前麵粉配給雖少，但總不至恐慌，二三星期後，小麥卽可運到。至於米，在本月初各店存量，約二十餘萬石，再加上配給米，已足够全上海一個月之用，但因商米出售未加限制，以致二十餘萬石的米，不及一星期卽已售元。近來到米雖已增多，但如不加限制，卽多到亦必多賣，這樣，無錢的貧民將更受苦，因此政府不得不規定每人憑證購買五升的辦法。</p>
<p>總之，有許多人勸我們不要再限價，認為不限價一切都可以買到了，至於取消限價之後，是否就可以買到東西，是另　一個問題，卽使能够買到，請大家想一想，這種情形，方便的是有錢人，高興的是投機商，而痛苦的却是老百姓。我們現在雖然使人民一時感到不方便，但無論米·菜·肉·油·糖等人民所最需的物品，一般的說來，總算是維持了以前的限價。當我們聽到一般市民親友和家人說起買不到這個那個，以及看到許多商店門前排列長隊時，內心是非常難受，因為我深深感覺到自已沒有將事情辦好。處在這種情况之下，最簡單推却責任的方法，或者就是下令取消限價，但這在個人的責任上及良心上，實不應亦不能亦不會如此做。我說這些話，並非要大家諒解我們，而是希望大家明瞭，這是人民自已的事情，要大家協助我們來共同解決如許的困難問題。我相信在下個月，如人民切實與政府合作，實施配給制度，採取限購辦法，上海市塲，無論如何，是可以安定下來的。</p>
<p>今天大家所關心的問題，並非目前幾個星期的事情，而是今後如何得到長期的安定。很多人關心上海的物價低，外面的物價高，誠恐造成只有流出不流入的現象。關於這個問題，我們應該知道，為什麼農民不肯售出農產品，農民所顧慮的，就是恐怕出售自已的農產品後，不能購到自已所需的工業品，其實這個問題，是可以解決的。我們知道，上海是存有大量物資的，不但布·紗·就是肥皂·火柴·香烟·以及其他百貨，亦為全國之冠。據初步統計，上海紡織業每月可產棉布二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇疋，織布九八·三〇〇疋，衛生衫一二〇·〇〇〇打，襪十二九〇·〇〇〇打，膠鞋四。八〇〇·〇〇〇雙，香烟二〇〇·〇〇〇箱，這些數字，是非常大的，在過去均由各地商人自由採購，現在各地來上海採購這些工業成品時，除無生產的城市外，均應負責供應相等價值的農產物。各省市縣所採取的聯合購銷辦法，不但可以使物資交流，而且可以促進增加生產。取締各地商人囤積，以及抬高物價的不法行為，這就是實行全面經濟管制的第一步工作。</p>
<p>第二個問題，大家關心的是生產會不會生問題，據正確的統計，上海所需原料，柴油汽油存量，至少可供三月之用，花紗有美援供應，在三個月之內，是無虞缺乏的。至於三個月以後，聯合採購的原料，當可使其不致中斷。目前燃料雖缺，但在政府加緊運購之下，亦不致發生大的問題。現在政府已撥出外匯，向國外購買各工廠所需原料，政府自始至終，一向對於這一問題，非常重視，並且認為只有增加生產，方能眞正安定市塲。我也知道，因為環境的限制，以及產銷的困難，一般工商界人土，意志都是相當消沉，但希望大家要顧到整個國策及今日國家處境的困難，以渡過今日的難關。至於工商界應得的利潤，政府絕對負責，並一定予以保陣，這個在財政經濟緊急處分令中，亦有明文規定。假使商家因為成本之增加，而有正當的理由，自可申請當地政府改變價格，但上海工商界，必須放棄利用經濟的混亂，以取得暴利的想念。政府為了顧到整個國家以及社會的安全，及保陣正當商業的發展，必須採取嚴格管制的政策，這種管制政策，與正當工商界的利益，是決不相違背的。我們知道，主辦工商，不但是個人的權利，而且對國家對社會亦應有重大的義務。關於物價問題限價政策，自然是一種非常的辦法，在某種塲合中當然不是一成不變的。譬如冬天的棉花，一定是比夏天貴，冬天的電扇，一定要比夏天便宜。同時我也承認，有若千地方，限價不一定是合情合理，但這種八一九的基本價格的標準，是絕不錯的。同時政府所採取的經濟管制政策，亦是正確而必須堅持的。今後政府對於重要必需品及對人民生活有重大影響的物品，必須嚴格的控制，使人民生活安定，得到保障，至其他一般物價，在工商界方面，當以不虧本，而且取得合法利益為原則。但絕不允許有投機行為，及黑市買賣之存在。因為投機行為及黑市買賣，這不僅是有害於國家經濟，而且正當商人，也應認為是一種恥辱的事情，祇有在這種情况下，不讓任何人操縱市塲，壟斷市塲，才能造成安定的經濟局面。這就是我們對物價管制的一貫態度，亦從來沒有變更過的。最近市塲上黑市交易為數雖不多，但黑市事實之存在，就是市傷不安之重要表現，經濟管制當局將用全力加以撲滅。同時，亦希望市民注意，近來有許多不良份子，故意喊出各種黑市價格，並散播謠言，來動搖市塲煽惑人心，每一市民，對於此種陰謀，必須嚴加防範。</p>
<p>天下的路，是人走出來的，所有新的路往往是在絕路時尋找出來的。今天是困難萬分的時候，新的好的辦法，也就應自困難中來產生，成畏，以至於完成。但我們必須知道，這是十分痛苦和艱鉅的工作，我們要求得大事業的成功，必須要忍氣耐煩，雖然我們在工作過程中，不斷的遭遇到困難，但無論這種困難，來自何方，沒有不能克服的。所最可怕的，是沒有信心和決心。現在有許多人，看見了困難，好像已在那裏開始恐懼了，甚至於開始搖動了自已的信心和決心，這是目前最大的敵人，希望全上海市民，本着政府旣定的決策，同心同德，一致協助政府，來保障此次經濟改革已得的成績，並致力於爭取最後的成功。</p>

<h3>周未銀根轉俏　市息又見上升</h3>
<p>昨爲本週週未，本市須銀根，又見由平轉俏，市場需求　　，但供源則見寥落，市場利率反形略升，重告浮出二角關外，大致在二角一分，高見二角四分。現鈔籌碼甚以爲缺，原因由於業內行莊，向央行提領額度，因隔日頭寸關系，而告減少之故。</p>
<p>據悉：本市一部份行莊，因連日市面鈔荒顯著，而客户提存頻繁，爲顧全事實起見，巳自行規定，客戶提支現鈔，應有隔夜頭寸爲限，聞日來行莊提現限額，較過去已告放寬云　又訊：市場利率，近又與牌價利率，頗有距離，銀錢業人土希望不作硬性規定，藉以維持行莊之業務。頃中央銀行負責人談：決維持法定利率，放款仍以三分，存款二分爲準則，市場之黑市利率係非法利率，不能獲得法律之保障，至黑市利率，金管局正設法予以取締。</p>
<h3>法幣收兌數額　已逾三分之二</h3>
<p>收兌法幣期，將於下月二十日截止，據查自八月二十日開始收兌以來，迄今兩個月，全國各地共已收兌逾四百萬億元，佔發行總三分之二。</p>
<p>又悉：中央造幣廠所鑄之一分鋼質輔幣，業已鑄就四百餘萬枚，陸續送交國行收存，該行並已向財政部請示發行日期，外傳可歸於下週開始流通，俾加速收兌小額法幣，協助收兌工作如期完成。又聞半圓銀幣。中央造幣廠下週亦將開始鑄造。</p>
<h3>資金南流　情勢緩和</h3>
<p>中央銀行漢口行經理楊汝梅，日前來滬述職，並請示今後業務方針，楊氏定明日赴京向財政部商洽要公。據楊氏語本所記者：漢口市場較爲穩定，利息亦平，放款日拆爲一元三，同業爲八角，金銀收兌情形極爲良好，銀元收兌最多，爲五百餘萬元，黃金亦達七萬餘兩，美鈔爲二十餘萬，港幣十餘萬。鄂省棉產及糧食產量均豐，棉花估計爲一百八十餘萬擔，有關各方已組織聯購處收購，故目前漢地匯款較多，匯出則反少，資金南流情勢已緩和。匯款限制解付，運現每人衹准一千元，超過此數，卽強制存入中央銀行。</p>
<h3>出口貨品限價　下週並無更動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕　　　管會息：上週我國外　品之國際行市極爲穩定。故本週（十月廿五日至三十日）出口貨品限價並無變更，一切將仍按上週之規定價格辨理。</p>
<h3>食糖無市</h3>
<p>糖市昨日市況仍極清稀，公會辨理配售制市將實施，同業存貨最近已絡繹送交公會，本街複製糖商及南貨號，俟配額決定後，卽可申請，故人心轉穩，場內已無交易。本街門銷經多日來之擠軋，多數市民大都購貯滿足，一股　幫客鑒於購買數量限制甚微，爭購目標又向他移，各店門市已較前清稀。</p>
<h3>到貨再見增多　米市場仍無交易</h3>
<p>昨日食米到貨再見增多，南市場到貨米行及米廠經售行，共一千〇六十三石，米號二七〇石五斗，合計一三三四石。北市到米行及經售六九一石，米號五七六石，米廠六五八石，自用者二七二石，合計二一九七石九斗。二市場共計到貨三千五百三十一石。市場報價有白粳·杜秈·糙尖·江西秈·等，各照原價。</p>
<p>雜糧交易，均未開出，黃豆配售昨日繼續，計配出鄱陽子黃豆一百三十五包，黑豆十五包，九江多豆九十一包，一律無袋，較限價減五角，其他各種雜糧，一律未開。</p>
<h3>紡建配布</h3>
<p>昨日棉布，依然停市，紡建公司循列開布，計不足碼十二磅龍頭細布及細料，每疋價二十五元五角，（如細布不敷去配，得以不足碼細斜接配，不得自由指定）。又二等品印花嗶嘰坯，每疋廿二元六角六分，（均限門市布號）承購。29碼半副牌嗶嘰坯廿三元五角，（限染廠）申購，另有美布〇〇二—B一一燈芯布，每公尺一元七角，D一四—二一歸地縐，每公尺一元五角，並有綱絲嗶嘰建國　紡袖絲紡建呢絹絲棉毛坯布布等，申購甚多。</p>
<h3>棉市略振</h3>
<p>現棉因複製用紗，須以棉花交換，人心樂觀，本市棉商所握部份存貨，聞將掉換複製成品，運往產地轉輾收棉，收得棉花運滬後，再掉成品，故棉業對此原則，業務上已有一綫生機。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業公會，頃以緊急通函各會員行莊，以奉財部指定，行莊辦理增資，其房屋及器具等升值，以八月上半月，全國　售物價總指數爲準云。</p>
<p>捲烟市場，已無交易，市況呈呆，單幫販運轉稀，因查驗頗嚴，客幫無法帶出，捲烟登記，限期廿五日截止，華商烟廠以原料正在搜購，成本亦日趨高，故產量將略形減少。</p>

<p>整軍再戰，鐵路原陣未動，東北風以史大法易出李承先，軍威果見強盛，時有攻勢，十五分蕭子文帶球深入，舉足低射，阎承寬撲地接住，裁判以爲越綫，判作進球，經巡邊鄧效良聲明未越白綫，取消不算。但一瞬間，張傑捲土重來，於十五碼起低射，又建一功，二對〇鐵路佔優。一般北方觀衆，替東北風行打氣，大呼加油不止。東北風環攻不已，陳勤不負衆望，扳回一城，成二比一。鐵路費春林入場，調下徐晟源，旋踵間，東北風得意再來，夏樹福於卅碼外吊中，姜琨衝門，與球同時入網，二—二扳成和局。皆大歡喜。</p>

<h3>Recovering Haicheng in Southern Liaoning with a Surprise Attack; Yingkou Already Under National Army Control</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch] Haicheng, an important military town and grain-producing area in southern Liaoning, was recovered by Liu Yuzhang's troops from the surprise attack corps advancing south from Shenyang at 9:30 AM on the 23rd. With Haicheng captured, Dashiqiao and Yingkou are as good as in the hands of the National Army, and their capture is imminent. Liu's troops advanced south from south of Anshan on the night of the 22nd, completed the encirclement of Haicheng on the morning of the 23rd, and captured it in one fell swoop. Approximately two regiments of the bandit Changjiang's forces, except for those killed or wounded, mostly fled towards Ximu City, Tasha Pu, 25 kilometers northeast of Haicheng. After recovering Haicheng, Liu's troops have pointed south towards Dashiqiao. Once Dashiqiao falls, Yingkou can be taken without a fight. It is reported that the naval fleet has already sailed to the overseas waters of Yingkou and will cooperate with the southward advancing corps to land in Yingkou and engage in a pincer attack. Haicheng is a grain-producing area with a bumper harvest this autumn. It will greatly help the grain shortage in Shenyang. The grain price in Shenyang has been falling for days, which is largely due to the success of the Mayor's grain storage campaign and the recovery of Zhangwu and Haicheng.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch] A decisive battle is brewing in western Liaoning, and both sides are intensifying their deployments. The bandits in Jinzhou continue to move towards the Jinxi area. The bandit independent divisions 4, 6, and 8 have recently moved from west of Jinxi, passing through Haicheng and heading towards Suizhong, their intentions unclear. There have only been constant small-scale contacts in the Jinxi area. The Shenyang westward advancing corps has not actively attacked, and the bandits gathered in Heishan have already retreated, knowing that they are facing difficulties.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] About three or four independent divisions of bandits from Changchun are moving south from Shuangyang. Currently, there are about three or four independent divisions of bandits in Changchun.</p>
<h3>Bitterly Defending Changchun, Running Out of Food and Ammunition; Zheng Dongguo Sacrifices Heroically; All 300 Officers and Soldiers Under His Command Perish</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch] It is reported that General Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters and concurrently Chairman of Jilin Province, who was defending Changchun alone, led his troops to firmly defend the core stronghold, the Central Bank Building, and fought bravely with the bandits since the start of the battle in the city. As ammunition and food ran out, he finally fired the last bullet on the morning of the 21st and sacrificed heroically. All 300 officers and soldiers under his command also perished. Zheng sent a telegram to his wife, Ms. Chen Zelian, on the 18th, saying, "Take care of yourself, farewell forever!" On the 20th, he sent a telegram to Du Yuming, Zhao Jiaxiang, and other friends, saying, "Although the overall situation is lost, we will fight to the end to preserve the loyalty and integrity of our revolutionary soldiers. I hope you will be relieved."</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of General Zheng</h3>
<p>General Zheng Dongguo was from Shimen, Hunan, and was 46 years old. He graduated from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy in 1924. In the spring of 1925, in the Battle of Danshui, as a company instructor, he participated in the Dare-to-Die Corps and was the first to enter the city. In March, he was promoted to the Training Regiment as a party representative. In December, he served as a major battalion commander of the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division. In the Northern Expedition and bandit suppression campaigns, he always took the lead. In 1932, he successively served as the commander of the independent brigade of the 2nd Division and the 4th and 5th Brigades. The following year, in the Battle of Gubeikou, he led his troops north from Luoyang and repeatedly achieved great feats. In 1936, he was promoted to commander of the 2nd Division and concurrently commander of the Tongguan Garrison. When the War of Resistance broke out, the General led his division to defend against the enemy. In 1938, he participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang. The following year, he was transferred to the deputy commander of the 95th Army, and then was appointed as the commander of the Honorary 1st Division and concurrently the deputy commander of the 5th Army. He participated in the Battle of Kunlun Pass with General Du Yuming. On the first day, he occupied the major strongholds on the periphery of the Japanese invaders. Subsequently, with enemy aircraft assisting in the battle, he fought fiercely for over ten days. The General, with the determination to win, seized the opportunity and launched a sudden advance towards the enemy. Kunlun Pass was then captured by us, and the Japanese 5th Division was crushed as a result. Military experts around the world gained a deep impression of the bravery of our national army. In 1940, he was transferred to the commander of the New 11th Army, which was later changed to the 8th Army, guarding Jiangnan, preventing the enemy from daring to cross the Lei River. Each inspection and review by the war zone headquarters resulted in the General's troops being ranked first. In 1943, he was appointed as the commander of the New 1st Army of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India. He worked hard to build up the army in India. At the end of October, he led the 38th and New 22nd Divisions, as well as the newly formed 30th Division, along with the 14th and 50th Divisions, and various directly subordinate artillery and tank units to launch a counterattack, successively capturing Jebushan and Myitkyina, and repeatedly defeating the stubborn enemy. The ugly captives lost their courage, and the situation in the Yunnan-Burma theater changed as a result. Later, the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India was expanded into the New 1st and New 6th Armies, and the General was promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India, assisting General Stilwell in opening up the China-India-Burma international route. From the counterattack in northern Burma in October 1943 to March 1945, he successively used tens of thousands of troops against an enemy force of 120,000, killing more than 30,000, wounding more than 70,000, and capturing more than 300, and obtaining many light and heavy weapons, creating brilliant military achievements. In January 1945, the National Government awarded him the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. In February, he was promoted to lieutenant general. In May, he represented the party members of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in Burma to attend the Sixth National Congress and was elected as an alternate member of the Sixth Central Executive Committee, and also attended the First Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee. Soon after the task of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India was completed, the General led his troops in triumph and was reassigned as the Deputy Commander of the Third Front Army. In September, he flew to Nanjing and Shanghai to handle the reception of newly formed underground troops. In the spring of 1946, he was transferred to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Headquarters and also acted as the Commander-in-Chief, leading his troops from Jinzhou to advance on Shenyang, and then supervising the troops in Siping Street, directly attacking Changchun and Jilin, reaching the south bank of the Songhua River. In September, he supervised the troops in Rehe and assisted the military affairs in eastern Hebei and southern Chahar. In November, he supervised the troops in eastern Liaoning again, recovering Andong and Tonghua. In the spring of 1947, the Communist army launched a large-scale offensive in the Northeast. The General then led his troops to relieve the siege of Siping, saving the situation in the Northeast. In September, he was appointed Deputy Director of the Northeast Xing Yuan (Headquarters), assisting in military and political affairs in the Northeast. On February 1, 1948, after the establishment of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the General served as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and concurrently Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, stationed in Changchun, shielding southern Songliao, and then concurrently served as the Commander of the Changchun Garrison. The General was handsome and refined, amiable and dignified, proficient in military strategy, skilled in literature, and had the demeanor of a Confucian general. Many of his staff were also talented young people. The General was frugal and self-disciplined throughout his life, with no savings. He left behind two sons and one daughter.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses the Current Situation; Committees Hope the Government Will Thoroughly Reform; Stabilize Prices and Safeguard International Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan held a meeting to discuss the current situation at 9 AM on the 23rd. More than 200 members attended. Rao Fenghuang was elected as chairman. First, the proposer, Hu Qiuyuan, reported his personal opinions. Those who continued to speak included Du Xunruo, Lei Yin, Miao Qiping, Liu Shengbing, Bao Huaguo, Huang Jianzhong, Wang Zemin, Shen Chongyu, Zhan Qinghui, Huang Xiren, Dong Zhengzhi, Zhou Jieren, and Lu Fu, etc. Yang Jiying and others also submitted written opinions. All expressed their concern for the current situation. Finally, the original proposer was asked to summarize the opinions expressed by the various members and draw a conclusion. The opinions of all speakers unanimously believed that the Communist bandits used international forces to control the Northeast, causing China to enter a new period of national crisis. This is not a matter of temporary military success or failure of the government. If it is not handled well afterwards, it will affect the survival of the entire nation. The fact that the Northeast is not in the hands of the legitimate government of China not only threatens the survival of the entire nation but has also endangered world peace. The speakers criticized the government's administration but also believed that if this government cannot be consolidated, the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction will follow. Therefore,</p>
<p>In the political aspect, it is hoped that the government can thoroughly reform and strengthen itself with the greatest determination, especially by being truly responsible and fulfilling the reality of a responsible cabinet, knowing when to advance and retreat. From the central government to the local level, new people must be used, new policies must be implemented, and corrupt and mediocre people must be eliminated, and people with both integrity and ability should be appointed. The National Army on the front lines should not fail in its duties, promote cooperation between the military and the people, and the government must have fair rewards and punishments, especially by truly reforming local politics, training new troops, and appointing capable and upright people to organize local armed forces to protect their hometowns.</p>
<p>In the economic aspect, it is hoped that the government will make good use of all its foreign exchange to purchase daily necessities for the people and stabilize prices and promote production in a reasonable and effective manner, especially by using great determination to sanction powerful families.</p>
<p>In the diplomatic aspect, the speakers all reiterated the Chinese people's determination to support international peace and also hoped that friendly countries would respect their treaty obligations, understand the situation in the Northeast, and provide China with necessary cooperation in relation to the safety and security of the world. At the same time, it is hoped that the government will adjust diplomatic relations with various countries and promote cooperation based on the Chinese people's love of peace and spirit of resistance against aggression.</p>
<p>All speakers unanimously expressed their determination to resist the Communist bandits and firmly believe that if the government can thoroughly reform and the national will is concentrated, China will be able to overcome its difficulties and rebuild the country's freedom, stability, and glory, and the Legislative Yuan should also use its power to urge the government to make the necessary reforms and live up to the expectations of the people.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Treatment for Public Education Personnel; Principle Passed by Legislative Yuan Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The Joint Committee of the Budget and Finance Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, with Yin Shuxian as chairman, to preliminarily examine the various proposals related to adjusting treatment and improving the lives of public education personnel. After merging the discussions, the following resolutions were made: (1) The principle of adjusting treatment is to not increase issuance (of currency). (2) The adjustment increase shall not be less than 50% of the existing income, and shall not be calculated on the basis of a base figure. Special districts will receive additional living allowances. (3) Strengthen the rationing system and formulate comprehensive implementation measures. (4) Strictly implement the one-person, one-salary system. Violators will be treated as corrupt officials. (5) The welfare undertakings of civil servants will be coordinated by the Executive Yuan at the central level and by the provincial and municipal governments at the provincial and municipal levels, but the principle is not to set up separate institutions. (6) The adjustment of treatment includes personnel at the central, provincial, and municipal levels. As for the treatment of county-level personnel, it will be handled quickly in accordance with the above-mentioned principles. (7) The methods of raising funds for adjusting treatment include canceling subsidies for state-owned and public utilities, abolishing institutions that have not completed legislative procedures and institutions outside the establishment, rectifying taxation and state-owned enterprises, eliminating embezzlement, clearing the proceeds from the sale of state-owned property and materials, rectifying military supplies, and verifying salary payments. If all these items are effectively implemented, there should be no problem in increasing the adjustment of treatment for public education personnel by 50%. As for the date of the adjustment, it was originally intended to be from October, but after a decision, it was not specified.</p>

The central government has been discussing these new measures to remedy the shortcomings of the financial and economic disposal order for several days and has drafted several specific measures. However, when Premier Weng convened a meeting of key officials in charge on the morning of the 21st, opinions on the measures related to prices were not yet unified, so they are awaiting the President's approval. Weng's trip included records of the central government's talks on financial and economic issues in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd Dispatch] Premier Weng arrived in Beiping by special plane at 11:30 AM on the 23rd. Xu Yongchang and Guo Rugui came with him.

He left at 4:00 PM and returned to the guest house to rest for a while. Then, at 6:00 PM, he visited Zhang Lisheng to review the economic management in the north and discuss the issue of transporting southern grain to the north. Weng will stay in Beiping for a short time to decide on new economic management measures. A reporter from Beiping visited Weng on the 23rd. He said, "Once you become an official, you lose your freedom and cannot speak casually." He did not give a specific answer regarding the stay in Beiping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd Dispatch] President Chiang went to Jiaxing Temple at 9:00 AM on the 23rd to pay respects to the deceased Army Commander Ying and the deceased Division Commander Li Mingding and offer condolences to the families of the two generals.

<h3>Zhu Jiahua to Broadcast This Afternoon: The Road to Maintaining Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Zhu Jiahua, Honorary President of the World Federation of United Nations Associations and President of the China Association for the United Nations, will broadcast to the people of the world in Chinese and English at 11:30 AM on the first United Nations Day at the Central Broadcasting Station. The title is "The Road to Maintaining Peace," which will briefly state that it has been more than three years since the end of World War II, but the peace treaties with Germany and Japan have not yet been signed. This not only shows that it is easy to win victories on the battlefield but difficult to win peace at the conference table, but also shows that countries also have "those who can share adversity but not prosperity." Now the third General Assembly of the United Nations is being held in Paris. I, on behalf of the China Association for the United Nations, appeal to peace-loving people all over the world that peace is as fragile as a stack of eggs, and only by strengthening the support of the United Nations can peace be maintained.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department Spokesperson Sternly Denies Abandoning Aid to China; Batch of War Supplies Currently Being Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] A U.S. State Department spokesperson, in response to recent comments in some foreign newspapers that the United States has abandoned aid to President Chiang and plans to use Japan as an advanced base in the Pacific, condemned this statement as lacking common sense, and said: This kind of statement has no basis. The United States' policy towards the Nanjing government has not changed. The spokesperson acknowledged that the U.S. government had agreed last October, at President Chiang's request, to provide war supplies worth US$35 million in early October of this year. This batch of war supplies is currently being shipped to China. Government circles here believe that if the U.S. Republican Party wins in the upcoming presidential election, the current aid given to President Chiang will not only not be canceled but will even be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Grand Celebration of "United Nations Day"; President to Broadcast Proclamation Today; Foreign Minister Wang Will Also Make a Commemorative Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The 24th is United Nations Day, and the Presidential Office has scheduled a grand celebration ceremony to be held at 10 AM this morning. Three years ago, on this day, the United Nations Charter, which promotes world peace, came into effect. It was subsequently designated as "United Nations Day" by the Second Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly. (Please refer to pages 3 and 4 for news related to United Nations Day)</p>
<p>[United Nations Shanghai Office News] Today (the 24th) is United Nations Day. President Chiang is scheduled to broadcast a proclamation on United Nations Day at 7:30 PM this afternoon. Following that, Madame Chiang will broadcast the achievements of the China Committee of the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund in her capacity as Chairman of the Committee. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang will broadcast the work of the Children's Emergency Fund in China.

The broadcast will be from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM, broadcast nationwide by the Nanjing Central Radio Station, and rebroadcast in this city by the Shanghai Radio Station (wavelength 900 kHz).</p>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 23rd Dispatch] The United Nations Secretariat will begin commemorating United Nations Day on the 23rd, reading a telegram from Chinese President Chiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd Dispatch] On the eve of United Nations Day, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie broadcast to the country, saying that although the United Nations has suffered various obstacles and setbacks, it is still an organization that encourages world public opinion to save peace. Wang said: Our country's status in the United Nations today is very different from its status in the League of Nations in the past. China was not among the founders of the League of Nations at that time, and the League of Nations did not give our country an appropriate position. Therefore, China is not responsible for the failure of the League of Nations, but the current situation is very different. Our country is one of the founders of the United Nations, and our country is one of the non-permanent members of the Security Council. We have a special and unavoidable responsibility for its success or failure. Today, I want to remind all my compatriots that the main task of this United Nations is to prevent war and guarantee peace. If this task fails, the future of the world is unimaginable. In future wars, all scientific weapons, such as atomic bombs, rocket launchers, and germ warfare gases, will be used. We believe that no one can be considered a righteous victorious nation. Therefore, the task of the United Nations is truly sacred today. Wang said: The past three years of the United Nations cannot be considered satisfactory, which is an undeniable fact, but when the position of the United Nations is about to stabilize, we should pay special attention to it and should not despise it. We should strengthen our trust in the United Nations and should not hesitate. Wang personally wrote the broadcast speech in commemoration of United Nations Day and broadcast it in Mandarin to the country at 5:15 PM Nanjing time on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>A Word to the Citizens of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Chiang Ching-kuo</p>
<p>In the past ten days or so, the general public's sentiment has been unstable due to the influence of market fluctuations. I also acknowledge that the current situation is indeed a significant challenge. On September 12th, I told the citizens of Shanghai that the future of Shanghai's economic controls would not be smooth sailing or a moonlit, gentle breeze, but rather a difficult and arduous task. Now, we are indeed encountering such a juncture, which is something we anticipated.</p>
<p>Everyone, please calmly consider that Shanghai's production volume in the past month, except for a few smaller factories that reduced work due to a lack of raw materials, has generally not decreased, especially the production of daily necessities, with the exception of the flour industry. This year, the harvests in the rural areas of the country have generally been bountiful. Although the increase in the amount of Gold Yuan Certificates issued is sufficient to stimulate price increases, the reserve backing for the Gold Yuan Certificates has also increased. The current unease seems to be mostly due to man-made factors. Since the government ordered the exchange of gold banknotes, the general public has naturally had their purchasing power greatly enhanced because they have exchanged a large amount of Gold Yuan Certificates. For example, taking the business situation of Wing On Company as an example, the sales value on August 17th was 11.879 Gold Yuan Certificates; on August 30th, it increased to 28.015 Gold Yuan Certificates; on September 15th, it increased to 85.745 Gold Yuan Certificates; and on October 10th, it further increased to 111.714 Gold Yuan Certificates. From these figures, it can be seen that the exchange of gold banknotes and the increase in purchasing power are directly related. Has Shanghai's merchandise been sold out now? Absolutely not. Taking Wing On Company as an example again, the total sales in September were 1,542,094 Gold Yuan Certificates, and the number of goods purchased was 1,164,760 Gold Yuan Certificates. The difference between the two numbers is limited, but if the inventory is included, this quantity must exceed the monthly purchase quantity several times. Taking the example of October, on October 8th alone, sales amounted to 82,000 Gold Yuan Certificates, and purchases also reached 72,000 Gold Yuan Certificates. Although the purchase quantity cannot be equal to the sales quantity, if there is inventory from previous years, there will definitely not be any panic. Wing On Company is just one example. In general, merchants are clamoring that goods have been sold out, but in reality, this may be the case for a few stores, but generally speaking, there is no shortage of inventory in various counties and stores. As another example, the amount of yarn allocated to the textile industry last month was the same as the previous month, and the cotton cloth inventory on October 1st was 6.78 million bolts, and on October 20th, the inventory was still 6.58 million bolts. In this way, the production of various cotton textiles will definitely not decrease. Therefore, we can firmly believe that Shanghai does not lack goods for the market, but rather that merchants are anticipating price increases and are unwilling to release their inventory, resulting in the so-called shortage phenomenon today. In the future, we must make them release their goods and supply the market at the limited price. To be honest, the raw materials used for these goods were all advanced before August 19th. The government painstakingly maintains the limited prices of public utilities and daily necessities in order to prevent changes in wages. Since the raw materials and wages are from "August 19th," what reason is there not to sell the goods at the "August 19th" limited price? Taking the current cloth production situation as an example, a bolt of twill cloth, in addition to the allocated yarn price, salaries, wages, electricity costs, and other cost items, can still earn 1.8 Gold Yuan Certificates per bolt if sold at the August 19th limited price. From this point of view, there is no loss-making phenomenon for general manufacturers. Naturally, if all the goods are completely supplied to the market now, there will be panic buying because Shanghai prices are lower than those in other places. However, next month, when every Shanghai citizen obtains a shopping certificate, under the quota purchase system, there will no longer be any need to fear merchants such as so-called "single carriers" snapping up goods. At that time, whether we are wholesalers, retailers, or manufacturers, we will have to take out our inventory. When necessary, a portion of the goods will be purchased by the government and sold to various places in order to exchange for the agricultural raw materials and food needed by Shanghai.

<h3>Thoughts on United Nations Day</h3>
<p>Today is "United Nations Day," and billions of people in 58 countries around the world are enthusiastically celebrating and praying for peace, expressing humanity's sincere love and care for the United Nations organization. Although everyone understands in their hearts that the foundation of the United Nations is built on the "unanimity of opinions" of the great powers, and whether it can exert its effect of maintaining world peace depends on whether today's great powers can unite and cooperate, in any case, the United Nations has not lost its symbolic significance as "one world," and it is still humanity's only hope for world peace. Although today's world is in the torrent of bipolarization, we are pleased to celebrate the anniversary of the United Nations and still hold infinite hope for the future of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The germination of the United Nations began with the "Declaration of the United Nations" on New Year's Day in 1942. At that time, the Pacific War had not broken out for long, and the German army was advancing deep into Soviet territory, which can be described as the darkest era of mankind. Whether the United Nations had any hope of winning the war was even more bleak. Therefore, the United Nations issued a declaration, on the one hand, publicly announcing the United Nations' war goals, and on the other hand, calling on all countries to fight side by side to the end, and never to make a separate peace with the Axis powers. Since then, the idea of the United Nations has gradually developed. At the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in October 1943, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union issued a "Four-Power Universal Security Declaration," which showed the four powers' determination to guarantee collective security after the war, and can be regarded as the predecessor of the United Nations Charter. Subsequently, the United Nations gradually gained an advantage in military affairs, and it was expected that complete victory was not far away. Representatives of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union met again at Dumbarton Oaks in the United States to draw a "blueprint" for today's United Nations organization. On April 25, 1945, the San Francisco Conference passed the United Nations Charter, and the United Nations organization was born.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the perspective of the United Nations' birth process, it is not difficult to understand the significance of the United Nations. In short, during the war, the United Nations relied on the joint cooperation of all countries to win military victory; after the victory, it also relied on all countries to unite in the same spirit to jointly create world peace. Looking back at the growth of the United Nations in the past seven or eight years, the United Nations has not only won a glorious victory for mankind, but has also laid a solid foundation for world peace. Although the current international situation seems to run counter to the purpose of the United Nations and is moving towards division, in fact, the achievements of the United Nations are indeed rare and valuable. Although the United Nations is currently facing a severe test due to the Berlin issue, human conscience will surely enable the United Nations to safely overcome this difficult obstacle and become a truly effective international organization for maintaining world peace.</p>
<p>Since the United Nations Charter officially came into effect on November 24, 1945, it has held three general assemblies. On balance, the United Nations has indeed eliminated a lot of hatred, disputes, and wars among nations, especially the Security Council, which has had more successes than failures. In fact, the Security Council's successes include the following: (1) The withdrawal of Allied troops stationed in Iran, Syria, and Lebanon, which peacefully resolved the issues of the three countries; (2) The mediation of the "Dutch-Indonesian conflict" in Indonesia, which spared 90 million Indonesians from the ravages of war; (3) The reconciliation of the "India-Pakistan dispute" in India, which spared 400 million people in India and Pakistan from the catastrophe of civil war; (4) The mediation of the "Jewish-Arab War" in Palestine, and the ceasefire order was finally accepted by both sides; (5) For the Greek civil war, the United Nations sent personnel to investigate and mediate, which finally eased the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. These achievements were all obtained through difficult hardships, and on this day of celebrating the birth of the United Nations, we must highlight them and cherish and care for them.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, we have to worry about the future of the United Nations. At the first United Nations General Assembly, the differences of opinion among the great powers were exposed. At the second United Nations General Assembly in 1947, Soviet representative Vyshinsky openly denounced American dignitaries as "warmongers" in the conference hall. Now, the third General Assembly is being held in the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. Because of the Berlin blockade issue, the Soviet Union and the Western Allies have been arguing endlessly, causing everyone to be fearful and worried, not knowing whether the United Nations can pass this serious test.</p>
<p>However, we always believe that the success of the United Nations depends on international cooperation and unity, especially mutual tolerance and concession between the United States and the Soviet Union. Today is United Nations Day, and countries around the world are celebrating it. We hope that the politicians and diplomats of the great powers can deeply reflect on this day, and everyone should support the United Nations with sincerity, abandon "minor differences," accommodate "major commonalities," and strive for the unity of opinions among the great powers, thereby promoting international unity and cooperation. In this way, not only will any international dispute not be difficult to obtain a peaceful resolution plan, but the United Nations will also have its beautiful prospects.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province Refuses Remittances from Outside, Provincial Government Issues Emergency Order to Stop Receiving Them Yesterday, Sugar, Cooking Oil, Cotton Yarn, etc. Prohibited from Being Shipped Out</h3>
<p>[Report from Taipei, this newspaper, 23rd] The problems of commodity prices and material supply in Taiwan Province are facing an unprecedented crisis. Today, the retail price of rice has reached 600 yuan per catty, an increase of two times compared to three days ago and an increase of 60% compared to yesterday. Panic about other sugar, oil, and salt is still increasing. In order to save the situation, the Provincial Government issued an emergency order this morning, which includes three items: (1) Stop remittances to Taiwan from outside the province from now on to curb speculative funds from attacking. (2) Sugar, cooking oil, cotton, cotton yarn, and their finished products are not allowed to be taken out and transported without special permission from the Provincial Government.

The headquarters organized a patrol team, which set off immediately to investigate the looting of goods by scattered soldiers and vagrants. In September and October, Xidi transported more than 50,000 stones of rice to Shanghai.

<h3>Ping Mi Mian Industry Association Chairman Wang Zhenting Arrested and Sent to Special Court, Violated Business Crimes and Hoarded Grain All Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Report from Beiping, this newspaper, 23rd] The Inspection Bureau created a masterpiece. Wang Zhenting, chairman of the Rice and Flour Industry Association and a Beiping City Councilor, was arrested for destroying economic control and his large amount of grain was confiscated. According to a tip-off, the authorities spent a week investigating that Wang used the strong capital and special status of his four major grain stores, Changshunhao, etc., to fight against the authorities after August 19th, successively purchasing 900 catties of millet and 3,500 catties of corn flour at black market prices, and privately hiding 2,000 catties of corn flour and 130 bags of wheat flour, entering and exiting the Tianqiao black market to make huge profits.

This morning at 10 am, Wang was summoned to the Social Bureau.

<h3>UN Political Committee Decides to Defer Debate on Holy Land Issue - Soviet Bloc's Opposition Ultimately Fails - US Considers Loan to Israel</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 23rd] The UN Political Committee voted 19 to 16, with 14 abstentions, on the 23rd to postpone the debate on the Palestine issue for one week. The United States voted for postponement, the United Kingdom abstained, and France opposed postponement. Polish representative Katz-Suchy immediately attacked the United States for using "political tactics" to prevent the UN from considering the Palestine situation before the US elections on November 2nd. This week has already seen two postponements of discussions on the Holy Land issue. When the Political Committee convened today, it unanimously agreed to discuss Palestine without objection, but a procedural debate arose over allowing representatives from the Palestinian Higher Committee to attend as observers, preventing the meeting from progressing. After an hour of discussion, Iranian representative Endisan proposed a postponement to allow a week to consider the request of the Higher Committee. Although the Soviet bloc shouted "political tactics," the committee ultimately passed the postponement. Katz-Suchy criticized Iran's reason as a "weak excuse," and claimed that the real reason was "political." Chairman Spaak prevented others from speaking to avoid prolonging the debate. He stated that the committee would reconvene on the 25th to review the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee, and then discuss the Greek issue, before adjourning the meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] After the State Department re-examined all aspects of Israel's situation, the United States seems to be moving further toward full diplomatic recognition of the new nation.

<h3>Our Representative Jiang Tingfu Clarifies Position on Berlin Issue - Deeply Willing to Contribute to Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] Our representative to the UN General Assembly, Jiang Tingfu, delivered a speech in the Security Council today. He answered in detail various speculations about China's attitude towards the Berlin issue. Jiang stated: "We have been working together for a long time. Our only simple goal is to eliminate tensions and peacefully resolve disputes."</p>
<p>"Although our work goal is very simple, there may still be critics who criticize our work, saying that we have not made every effort, or that we have done too much, and so on. There are also those who want to see us make greater efforts, or who will see our various omissions as strange." Jiang continued, "For these critics, I would like to respond that if we can do well in the present and future, it is not too late to clarify the responsibility for past events. I must also mention that seeking a final solution through peaceful means will make the problem easier to solve. At the very least, we can make an indirect contribution to the solution of the problem." To the critics who say we have done too much, I also ask the Chairman to allow me to respond. Among the various crises that have shocked the world after the war, the recent Berlin incident is the most serious. The world is alarmed by this, and people all over the world are shouting loudly, or whispering to each other, asking, "Will the great war happen again?" The United Nations Charter entrusts the Security Council with the primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. Faced with this kind of crisis, if the Security Council evades its responsibility, it will be a major blow to the entire world organization and human hope." Jiang concluded, "The proposal put forward by the neutral countries of the Security Council this time is very fair. This proposal has become a plan for every country to achieve glorious peace. If the Security Council can accept the proposal, this meeting will become a major decisive event in history."</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits From Pudong Entered the City to Plot Mischief: Chase and Shooting Lead to Hand-to-Hand Combat: A Pedestrian Shot in the Leg on Linsen Road: A Total of Five Wounded Bandits Captured and Sent to the Hospital</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 9:20 PM the night before last, Sun Xingyu, a uniformed police chief of the Lujiawan Police Sub-Bureau, was patrolling on a bicycle when he suddenly heard shouts for capture from behind at the intersection of Linsen Road and Chengdu South Road. He also saw two people running towards him. Police Chief Sun immediately drew his gun and ordered the two to stop. At the same time, several plainclothes personnel from the Garrison Command caught up and helped to detain the two, confiscating a handgun. It was also said that one person had escaped westward. The police chief then rode his bicycle alone to chase after the person westward. Unexpectedly, the person noticed someone chasing him from behind and quickly drew a gun, firing two shots. One bullet hit a pedestrian in the leg, who fell to the ground. The person then turned into Sinan Road. Police Chief Sun continued to chase relentlessly. When they reached Nanchang Road, the person took off his upper body clothing and threw it aside, while still running frantically forward. The chase continued to Hualong Road, where the person fired another shot, fortunately missing. At the same time, a team member from the Garrison Command caught up. After Police Chief Sun explained the clothing and appearance of the fleeing suspect, they helped to pursue him forcefully.

Chen Zilin and Li Jinyu both burst into tears in the defendant's column, repeatedly shouting injustice. The mothers, wives, and many family members of the two defendants, regardless of the dignity of the court, questioned the court and knelt down, crying and causing chaos.

The judges and clerks in the court retreated from the court to avoid the situation. Afterwards, the bailiffs forcibly drove the family members of each defendant and other listeners out of the courtroom and forced the two defendants to be sent to the detention room next to the court for custody. However, the two defendants refused to affix their fingerprints and were persuaded by the bailiffs, but still cursed loudly. It was not until late at night that they were sent to the Masnan Road Detention Center in a prison car.</p>

<h3>National Medicine Trade Association Restricts Purchase of Tonics</h3>
<p>Purchasing Wood Requires a License</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the Municipal National Medicine stores have also discovered teams of people rushing to buy tonics. Because raw materials are difficult to purchase, the industry association has submitted a document to the Social Bureau requesting restrictions on purchases, which the Social Bureau has approved. Now, customers who purchase tonic materials from Wanhao must have a prescription from a doctor and must have it decocted by the retailer. In addition, Dang Hanchun Tang, which is famous for dispensing ginseng Zaozao pills, is also restricting supply due to the extremely crowded queues of customers purchasing them, limiting purchases to 10 large pills or 4 small pills.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Commercial Industry Association has recently obtained approval from the Social Bureau that those who purchase wood from the industry are limited to those with a business license for construction factories, a construction license, or a commercial registration certificate for woodwork and woodenware.</p>
<h3>No Worries About Industrial Coal This Winter: Wheat Ordered Will Arrive Within a Month: Edible Oil Raw Materials, Gauze, and Sugar Are All Sufficient</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Gongyun, the Vice President of the Central Bank, announced yesterday: This winter, there is no need to worry about industrial coal in the city. The Coal Regulation Committee has decided to purchase coal from the Kailuan, Taiwan, Huainan, and East China mines and transport it to Shanghai as soon as possible. The monthly supply can reach 200,000 tons. In addition to the national coal, the China Trust Bureau has ordered another 70,000 tons of foreign coal, which will be shipped to Shanghai one after another next month and will be allocated for security coal. In addition, flour mills in the city generally lack raw materials. In addition to purchasing wheat in northern Jiangsu, China has a quota of 50,000 tons of wheat in Canada and Australia. The order has been placed, and it is expected that they will arrive in succession within a month. Regarding the raw materials for edible oil, the city has a large reserve, which is enough to maintain for four months. In addition to being self-sufficient, Shanghai also has the surplus to supply cotton yarn, cloth, and sugar to other cities.</p>
<h3>Items Already Purchased With Identity Cards Will Be Deducted From Purchase Certificates</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The national identity cards are about to be exchanged. The Social Bureau has decided to deduct the old certificates with stamps of cotton cloth, etc., from the purchase certificates and not allow them to be repurchased. The technical problem is currently under study.</p>
<h3>Autumn Business Tax Payment Slips Will Be Issued Sequentially Starting From the 26th</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has determined the "tax base" for the total amount of business tax payable by businesses in the city for the autumn of the 1948 tax year in a fair and reasonable manner based on various accurate data. The autumn business tax payment slips for each business will be issued sequentially starting from the 26th. In order to inform taxpayers of the business tax payment procedures, the bureau has established a payment guide, the main points of which are recorded below: (1) Business tax payment slip delivery personnel have no right to check accounts, and businesses shall not pay delivery fees, nor may they send personnel to the store or company to collect them. (2) The payment period is stipulated to be within ten days from the date of receipt of the payment slip. (3) If there are errors in the payment slip, the original payment slip should be submitted to the bureau in writing for correction within two days from the date of receipt.

<h3>Manager of Huacheng Watch Store Denies Price Gouging During Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fan Shuyi, the manager of Huacheng Watch Store on Nanjing East Road, was sued for arbitrarily setting the selling price of Yilaikesen watches after August 19th as 165 yuan in gold within the counter and 110 yuan in gold outside the counter, resulting in internal and external discrepancies, intending to confuse. He also inflated the selling price of Olympic watches, which differed from the purchase price by a massive 85 yuan in gold, exceeding legal profits. It was obvious that he had deliberately violated the control order. After an investigation by the police, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. His criminal behavior constituted a crime under the National General Mobilization Law and the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Obstruction of National General Mobilization, and a public prosecution was filed. Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court held a trial yesterday afternoon. The defendant, Fan Shuyi, stated in court that the store only had one remaining Yilaikesen watch. The price before August 19th was 495 million legal currency. After August 19th, it was converted to 165 yuan in gold. The price of 110 yuan outside the counter was because business was slow and he intended to reduce the price for sale. He denied that there was any price increase as claimed in the police station. After his defense lawyer debated in court, the court decided to announce the verdict on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>1,006 Pigs Detained in Yangzhou Have Been Released: County Government Explains Only 200 Were Purchased</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Jiangdu on the 23rd] Regarding the report in Shanghai newspapers about the Jiangdu County Government intercepting pigs being transported to Shanghai, our reporter inquired with the county government to find out the truth. It was stated that the city of Yangzhou had stopped slaughtering for several days. When these piglets passed through the territory, they were found to be a large number. After inspection, they had no unified certificate from the Shanghai Supervisor's Office and no transportation and sales certificate from the producing area government. Some pig merchants had no association purchase certificate or ordinary merchant letter of credit. In order to prevent non-pig merchants from raising prices to purchase and create a black market, 200 pigs without any certificates were purchased with the consent of the original owner at the Yangzhou price limit by the county's pig industry association for flat sale to meet the needs of the military and civilians of the city. The remaining 1,006 pigs have all been released. Since then, pig merchants in Jinghu who hold a local government purchase certificate have not been detained.</p>

<h3>A Word of Advice to the Citizens of Shanghai by Police Chief Chiang Ching-kuo (Continued from Page One)</h3>
<p>As for daily necessities, such as oil, rice, sugar, and flour, many people now find it inconvenient to buy them because they have to queue. However, I believe that this inconvenience is partly caused by the citizens themselves. For example, the existing stock of sugar and oil in Shanghai, even if there is no further production or import, is enough for three or four months. Moreover, production and import are still continuing. At the beginning of this month, many citizens were buying one pound at a time, but now they are buying one bag or one barrel at a time. If everyone could buy only as much as they need, why would the government need to impose restrictions? However, under the current circumstances, if restrictions are not imposed, the four months' worth of stock will probably be bought up by the wealthy in four or five days, which will lead to sugar and oil shortages. The same is true for flour. Because the source of wheat is not abundant, flour production is also low. However, I can say that the current flour stock in Shanghai is at least enough for one month. But if restrictions are not imposed and a rationing system is not implemented, the one-month stock will probably be sold out in two or three days. At that time, even fried dough sticks and sesame cakes will be unavailable. Although the current flour ration is small, it will not cause panic. Wheat will be shipped here in two or three weeks. As for rice, at the beginning of this month, the stock in each store was about 200,000 shi (a unit of dry measure), plus the rationed rice, which was enough for the entire Shanghai for one month. However, because there were no restrictions on the sale of commercial rice, the 200,000 shi of rice were sold out in less than a week. Although the supply of rice has increased recently, if restrictions are not imposed, even more rice will be sold out quickly. In this case, the poor people without money will suffer more. Therefore, the government has to stipulate that each person can buy five sheng (another unit of dry measure) with a voucher.</p>
<p>In short, many people advise us not to impose price limits anymore, believing that everything can be bought if price limits are removed. However, whether things can be bought after the price limits are removed is another question. Even if things can be bought, please consider that this situation will benefit the wealthy and make speculators happy, but the common people will suffer. Although we are making the people feel inconvenienced temporarily, the prices of rice, vegetables, meat, oil, sugar, and other necessities for the people are generally maintained at the previous levels. When we hear ordinary citizens, relatives, and family members saying that they cannot buy this or that, and when we see long queues in front of many stores, we feel very sad because I deeply feel that I have not handled things well. In this situation, the easiest way to shirk responsibility is to order the removal of price limits. However, in terms of personal responsibility and conscience, I should not, cannot, and will not do so. I am saying these things not to ask for your understanding, but to hope that you understand that this is the people's own affair, and to ask you to help us solve these difficult problems together. I believe that next month, if the people cooperate with the government, implement the rationing system, and adopt purchase limits, the Shanghai market will be able to stabilize.</p>
<p>The issue that everyone is concerned about today is not just the current few weeks, but how to achieve long-term stability in the future. Many people are concerned that the prices in Shanghai are low while the prices outside are high, fearing that this will create a situation where goods only flow out and not in. Regarding this issue, we should know why farmers are unwilling to sell their agricultural products. Farmers are worried that after selling their agricultural products, they will not be able to buy the industrial products they need. In fact, this problem can be solved. We know that Shanghai has a large stock of materials. Not only cloth and yarn, but also soap, matches, cigarettes, and other general merchandise are the best in the country. According to preliminary statistics, the Shanghai textile industry can produce 2,000,000 bolts of cotton cloth, 98,300 bolts of woven cloth, 120,000 dozens of undershirts, 1,290,000 dozens of socks, 4,800,000 pairs of rubber shoes, and 200,000 cartons of cigarettes per month. These numbers are very large. In the past, merchants from various places freely purchased these goods. Now, when merchants from various places come to Shanghai to purchase these industrial products, except for cities that do not produce agricultural products, they should be responsible for supplying agricultural products of equivalent value. The joint purchase and sales methods adopted by various provinces, cities, and counties can not only facilitate the exchange of materials, but also promote increased production. Cracking down on the illegal activities of merchants hoarding goods and raising prices is the first step in implementing comprehensive economic control.</p>
<p>The second issue that everyone is concerned about is whether there will be problems with production. According to accurate statistics, the existing stock of raw materials, diesel, and gasoline needed in Shanghai can last for at least three months. Cotton yarn is supplied by US aid, so there is no need to worry about shortages within three months. As for after three months, the jointly purchased raw materials will ensure that production will not be interrupted. Although there is a shortage of fuel at present, the government is stepping up its purchase and transportation, so no major problems should occur. The government has now allocated foreign exchange to purchase the raw materials needed by various factories from abroad. The government has always attached great importance to this issue and believes that only by increasing production can the market be truly stabilized. I also know that due to environmental constraints and difficulties in production and sales, the morale of the general industrial and commercial community is quite low. However, I hope that everyone will take into account the overall national policy and the difficulties of the country today to overcome the current difficulties. As for the profits that the industrial and commercial community should receive, the government is absolutely responsible and will definitely protect them. This is also clearly stipulated in the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. If merchants have legitimate reasons for increasing prices due to increased costs, they can apply to the local government to change prices. However, the industrial and commercial community in Shanghai must give up the idea of taking advantage of the economic chaos to obtain windfall profits. In order to ensure the safety of the entire country and society, and to protect the development of legitimate businesses, the government must adopt a strict control policy. This control policy will not conflict with the interests of legitimate industrial and commercial businesses. We know that running businesses is not only an individual right, but also a major obligation to the country and society. Regarding the price problem and the price limit policy, it is naturally an extraordinary measure, which of course is not immutable in certain occasions. For example, cotton must be more expensive in winter than in summer, and electric fans must be cheaper in winter than in summer. At the same time, I also admit that in some places, price limits may not be reasonable, but the basic price standard of August 19th is absolutely correct. At the same time, the economic control policy adopted by the government is also correct and must be adhered to. In the future, the government must strictly control important necessities and goods that have a significant impact on people's lives to ensure people's lives are stable and protected. As for other general prices, the industrial and commercial community should take the principle of not losing money and obtaining legitimate profits. However, speculative activities and black market transactions will never be allowed. Because speculative activities and black market transactions are not only harmful to the national economy, but also a disgrace to legitimate merchants. Only in this situation, by not allowing anyone to manipulate the market or monopolize the market, can a stable economic situation be created. This is our consistent attitude towards price controls, and it has never changed. Although the number of black market transactions on the market recently is not large, the existence of black market facts is an important manifestation of market instability. The economic control authorities will do their best to eliminate it. At the same time, I also hope that the citizens will pay attention to the fact that recently there have been many malicious people who deliberately shout out various black market prices and spread rumors to shake the market and incite people's hearts. Every citizen must strictly guard against this kind of conspiracy.</p>
<p>The road to success is paved by people. All new roads are often found in times of desperation. Today is a time of extreme difficulty, and new and good methods should emerge from difficulties and become successful. But we must know that this is a very painful and arduous task. To achieve great success, we must be patient and endure. Although we constantly encounter difficulties in the process of our work, no matter where these difficulties come from, they cannot be overcome. The most terrible thing is the lack of confidence and determination. Now many people, when they see difficulties, seem to start to fear them, and even start to shake their confidence and determination. This is the biggest enemy at present. I hope that all the citizens of Shanghai, based on the government's established policies, will unite and assist the government to protect the achievements already made in this economic reform and strive for the final success.</p>

<h3>Tightening of Credit on the Weekend; Market Interest Rates Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as the weekend approached, the city's credit market saw a shift from stability to tightening, with demand increasing but supply dwindling. Market interest rates rose slightly, exceeding the 20% threshold, generally ranging from 21% to a high of 24%. Cash funds were particularly scarce, reportedly due to a reduction in the amount that industry firms could withdraw from the Central Bank, owing to overnight position constraints.</p>
<p>It is understood that some firms in the city, due to the noticeable cash shortage and frequent customer withdrawals, have stipulated that cash withdrawals by customers be limited to the amount of their overnight positions to ensure operations. It is said that the daily cash withdrawal limit for firms has been relaxed compared to the past. In addition, the gap between market interest rates and officially quoted interest rates has widened recently, and people in the money-lending industry hope that there will be no rigid regulations to maintain the business of firms. An official from the Central Bank stated that the legal interest rate will be maintained, with lending rates at 3% per month and deposit rates at 2% per month. The black market interest rate is illegal and cannot be legally protected, and the Financial Control Bureau is working to eliminate it.</p>
<h3>More Than Two-Thirds of Legal Tender Has Been Exchanged</h3>
<p>The period for exchanging legal tender will end on the 20th of next month. According to investigations, since the exchange began on August 20th, over two months, more than 4 trillion yuan has been exchanged nationwide, accounting for two-thirds of the total amount issued.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is learned that the Central Mint has already minted more than 4 million steel fractional coins (one fen), which have been successively delivered to the National Bank for storage. The bank has requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance regarding the date of issuance. It is rumored that they may be put into circulation next week to speed up the exchange of small denomination legal tender and assist in completing the exchange work as scheduled. It is also heard that the Central Mint will begin minting half-dollar silver coins next week.</p>
<h3>Easing of Capital Outflow Situation</h3>
<p>Yang Rumei, manager of the Hankou branch of the Central Bank, recently came to Shanghai to report on his work and request instructions on future business policies. Yang is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow to discuss important matters with the Ministry of Finance. According to Yang's statement to our reporter, the Hankou market is relatively stable, with interest rates also stable, with daily interbank lending at 1.3 yuan and interbank lending at 0.8 yuan. The exchange of gold and silver is proceeding very well, with the most silver dollars exchanged, amounting to over 5 million yuan, with gold reaching over 70,000 taels, US dollars at over 200,000, and Hong Kong dollars at over 100,000. Hubei Province has abundant cotton and grain yields, with cotton estimated at over 1.8 million dan. Relevant parties have organized joint purchasing agencies for procurement, so there are currently more remittances to Hankou than remittances out, and the capital outflow situation has eased. Remittance restrictions have been lifted, but the amount of cash that can be carried is limited to 1,000 yuan per person. Any amount exceeding this will be forcibly deposited into the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>No Changes to Export Commodity Price Limits Next Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Management Committee reports that the international market prices of our country's foreign products have been extremely stable this past week. Therefore, there will be no changes to the export commodity price limits for this week (October 25th to 30th), and everything will be handled according to the prices stipulated last week.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Inactive</h3>
<p>The sugar market remained extremely quiet yesterday. The association's allocation and sales system will be implemented, and member companies have recently been sending their inventories to the association one after another. Local sugar refiners and dried goods stores can apply after the quotas are determined, so confidence has returned, and there are no transactions in the market. After days of crowding, most citizens have purchased and stored enough sugar. Since the purchase quantity limit is very small, retailers have shifted their focus to other items, and the crowds at stores have thinned out compared to before.</p>
<h3>Rice Arrivals Increase Again, Rice Market Remains Inactive</h3>
<p>The arrival of rice increased again yesterday. At the South Market, rice shops and rice mill dealers sold a total of 1,063 shi, and rice dealers sold 270 shi and 5 dou, totaling 1,334 shi. At the North Market, rice shops and dealers sold 691 shi, rice dealers sold 576 shi, rice mills sold 658 shi, and self-users purchased 272 shi, totaling 2,197 shi and 9 dou. The total arrival of rice at the two markets was 3,531 shi. The market quotations include white polished rice, Du Xian rice, rough pointed rice, and Jiangxi Xian rice, all at the original prices.</p>
<p>There were no transactions in miscellaneous grains. The allocation and sale of yellow soybeans continued yesterday, with 135 packages of Poyangzi yellow soybeans, 15 packages of black soybeans, and 91 packages of Jiujiang Duodou allocated, all without bags, at 5 jiao less than the price limit. There were no transactions in other miscellaneous grains.</p>
<h3>Textile and Construction Cloth Distribution</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market remained closed. The Textile and Construction Company continued to distribute cloth, including substandard 12-pound Longtou fine cloth and fine material, priced at 25.5 yuan per bolt (if there is not enough fine cloth for allocation, it can be allocated with substandard fine twill, without free designation). Also, second-class printed serge blanks are priced at 22.66 yuan per bolt (limited to stores with retail cloth licenses) for purchase. 29.5-yard substandard Biji blanks are priced at 23.5 yuan (limited to dyeing factories) for application. In addition, there is US cloth 002-B11 corduroy, priced at 1.7 yuan per meter, D14-21 crinkle crepe, priced at 1.5 yuan per meter, as well as Gangsi serge, Jianguo hemp spinning, silk spinning, Jianguo tweed, silk cotton flannel blanks, etc., with many applications for purchase.</p>
<h3>Slight Rebound in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Because refabricated yarn requires cotton exchange, people are optimistic. It is heard that some of the cotton merchants' existing inventory in the city will be exchanged for refabricated finished products, which will be transported to the producing areas for further cotton collection. After the collected cotton is transported to Shanghai, it will be exchanged for finished products again. Therefore, the cotton industry has a glimmer of hope in this principle in terms of business.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industries Association recently issued an urgent circular to its members, stating that, as designated by the Ministry of Finance, the revaluation of buildings and equipment, etc., for capital increases by firms should be based on the national retail price index for the first half of August.</p>
<p>There are no transactions in the cigarette market, and the market is sluggish. The number of solo carriers has decreased because inspections are quite strict, and guest carriers cannot take them out. The deadline for cigarette registration is the 25th. Chinese cigarette factories report that raw materials are being purchased and costs are increasing daily, so production will be slightly reduced.</p>

<h3>Northeast Wind's First Battle Ends in a 2-2 Draw with the Railway Team; They Will Face Qingbai Again This Afternoon at 3:00 PM</h3>
<p>The Northeast Wind team came to Shanghai, and their first friendly match against the Railway team took place yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium, attracting a crowd of 6,000 to 7,000 people, making it a grand occasion. The result was a 2-2 draw, with the Railway team leading 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>The Railway team attacked first and showed some advantage, but without any results. The stalemate continued until the 17th minute when Xia Shufu took a shot, which was unfortunately caught by Liao Xiong. Xiao Liuzi charged at the goal and fell to the ground at the same time as Yan Chengkuan. Xiao Ziwen passed the ball, but Zheng Bingyi headed it out. Half an hour passed, and Zheng Bingyi accidentally touched the ball with his hand, giving a penalty to Xiao Ziwen, who opened the scoring. The Railway team led 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Railway team remained unchanged, while the Northeast Wind team replaced Li Chengxian with Shi Dafa. The team's morale was strengthened, and they had several attacks. At the 15th minute, Xiao Ziwen dribbled the ball deep and took a low shot, which Yan Chengkuan dived to catch. The referee thought it crossed the line and awarded a goal, but the linesman Deng Xiaoliang stated that it did not cross the white line, so the goal was disallowed. But in an instant, Zhang Jie came back and took a low shot from 15 yards, scoring another goal, making it 2-0 to the Railway team. The Northern spectators cheered for the Northeast Wind team and kept shouting encouragement. The Northeast Wind team attacked continuously, and Chen Qin lived up to expectations, pulling back a goal, making it 2-1. The Railway team replaced Xu Shengyuan with Fei Chunlin. Immediately afterwards, the Northeast Wind team came back again, with Xia Shufu crossing the ball from 30 yards out. Jiang Kun charged at the goal and headed the ball into the net, tying the score at 2-2. Everyone was happy.</p>
