<h3>美國會通過援外案　援華額為四億元　包括一億二千五百萬元軍事援助　已送杜魯門總統簽署</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十日電〕國會於二十日晨完成對六·〇三〇·七一〇·二二八元援外法案之行動，包括援華之四億元。該項法案，已送交杜魯門總統簽署。援華方案中包括一億二千五百萬元之軍事援助。</p>
<p>案院以三一八對六二票通過折衷方案後不久，參院即以口頭表決法通過該案。</p>
<p>在參院表決前，范登堡讚揚兩院聯席委員會恢復衆院削减額之大部份之舉動，係對「世界和平之基本貢獻」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕參衆兩院聯席委員會十九日晚打破嚴重僵局後，通過六·〇三〇·七一〇·二二八美元之援外基金，其中包括四億美元之援華基金。聯席委員會幷同意由美政府決定四十億美元之援歐基金應否分十五個月撥付抑分十二個月撥付。援華基金中包括一二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元之軍事援助。援外基金中包括一·三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元救濟及復興日·韓·德·奧四佔領區之款項。聯席委員會獲致協議後，遂打破將使國會可能不得於十九日晚休會之僵局。此爲參院之勝利，參院曾堅持援歐計劃及其他援助計劃應獲得政府所建議之款數。經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼及國務卿馬歇爾確信四十億美元在十二個月內必需撥付，且需要甚亟，除援歐基金外，該委會幷通過：（一）四億美元之援華基金，其中包括一二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元之軍事援助；（二）十三億美元救濟及復興德·日·奧·韓四佔領區之款；（三）二二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元爲希臘與土耳其「隔離哄產主義」之款；（四）三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元爲聯合國救濟兒童基金；（五）七〇·七一〇·二二八美元爲國際難民組織基金。聯席委員會幾全部同意於參院所主張之款數，該案之最後決定款數較杜魯門總統所要求者少五〇三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。</p>
<h3>中美雙邊協定　各項原則確定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕關於運用美國援華物資之中美雙邊協定，經外部月來加緊研究美方草案，並與美大使館積極磋商各項原則，均已參照美國「一九四八年經濟合作法案」及現實情况加以確定。一俟報吿立院獲得同意，即可正式簽字。此項協定將以行政協定方式簽訂。簽字後即可生效。據悉其內容主旨，除說明中美兩國經濟及其他關係均極密切，爲使中國自助，謀求國內經濟穩定，並消弭目前足致危及永久和平建立之形勢，而予援助外；並親定中國爲接受此種援助，應採擇之措施，及其他關於物資之供應及其他事項。全部　援除六千萬美金建設貸款外，均將以贈予方式供給我國。關於中國應行採取之措施，其重要者約爲：（一）實施自助計劃，增進農工生產，至不需要額外援助程度。爲達到此目的，美國將對煤·　·食糧之增產，及交通建設予以物資援助。（二）採取財政　措施，以穩定通貨，確定匯率，平衡預算，以重樹貨幣信用。（三）有效運用國內資源，及國外援助。包括一切物資·財富·勞役以及中國人在美國境內之財產與收益。（四）便利輸美貿易，並於合理之原則下，由中美雙方協議供應美國所需，而其本身欠缺之工業原料。此外並可能規定凡美國以贈與方式界予中國援助時，中國將以等値之法幣存入特別賬戶。此宗款額與前次中美救濟協定項下救濟物資售價尙未動用之款額合併。僅得運用於穩定幣制財政，增進生產，調查開發資源，及美國代表法幣開銷等目的，或雙方同意之其他目的。至於以借款方式援助之償付，則但由美國所需之中國出產償付。關於美援物資之運輸來華，將以利用美國船隻爲主。資助慈善救濟團體之物資，將准免關稅關於中國接受及運用美援物資或款項之情况及執行協定之經過，將於協定簽字後每三月向美國提出報吿。中國政府並應隨時因美國之請求，供給有助於援華計劃之必要報吿。關於援助之終止，除因計劃之全部執行自當終止外，美國政府如認爲協定條款未履行，且援助已背離原定之目的，或情勢變遷援助已與美國利益衝突時，停止一切援助計劃之進行。比項中美雙邊協定包括之各原則，大致與美國與歐洲各國間締訂者相若。而關於執行之技術問題，均將留特美援運用委會與美國代表隨時商洽決定。至京漢等地將爲運載美援物資船舶開港事，協定中並未涉及。</p>
<h3>政院令五省六市　特捐應如期募齊</h3>

<h3>立委名額問題可望解決　雷震昨返京覆命　攜有青年黨之書面意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲調解民靑兩黨立委名額斜紛之雷震氏，已於二十日晚搭車返京覆命。雷氏於臨行前曾在其寓所靜候民靑兩黨報吿中常會舉行之結束。渠於下午七時獲得民社黨張君勵電話，據稱：民社黨開會結束，對於立委問題意見，已與政府方面極為接近，該黨希望國民黨能退讓十名，俾使提案基本人數（三十名）能够補足，將來如果可能，則希望該黨仍有五十名立委參加。至於司法院副院長，及大法官·考試委員各二人，民社黨雖並不自動提名，但總統如有任用令發表，則將加以接受。雷氏於九時十五分復接獲靑年黨李璜之電話，據稱：會議結果，已擬有書面意見一件。言氏當即赴左舜生住宅接洽携取，旋即搭京滬車返京。雷氏行前曾三次與張羣通電話，轉吿民靑兩黨會議結果，張氏在滬約尙有一二日勾留；吳鐵城則已於二十日晚與雷氏同車返京。</p>
<h3>雷氏行前談話</h3>
<p>雷震於行前曾於車站吿記者：民社黨參加立院，大致已無問題。靑年黨於十九日本人赴該黨總部時，曾提七項意見，旋以若千點過分强調，本人未能代政府轉達，於逐條加以解釋後，即予退回。並表示希望該黨重加考慮。該黨乃於二十日再開中常會，對原來七項意見，已予修正，態度亦較前和緩。其內容雖未可完全宣佈，但可以吿知者，即該黨對各項問題，已有「轉灣」之處，故立委問題或可解決。至該黨參加行政·司法·考試三院，則將以立委名額問題解決而解決。至於該黨希望今後重要政洽揹施，須經三黨洽商決定一點，本人以爲不難做到，蓋如民靑兩黨參加行政院，則該二黨自有主張政事之權。另據記者探悉：靑年黨所提七項意見，對立委名額已不甚堅持，惟爲彌補起見，則竭力主張政府應以醫面保證該黨參加地方政府各點。</p>

<h3>正視上海市的幾個現實問題</h3>
<p>上海市參議會第六次大會，於今晨九時開幕，將分別討論上海市所面臨之各項實際問題，各方紛紛提出義案已達四十五件之多；當此大局動　萬方多難之秋，欲求地方的安定，根本不可能，尤其是　洋離　的國際都市，其所發生的社會問題，松外復雜，格外令人煩惱；時至今日，上海市民的生活，不問衣·食·住·行，無不發生嚴重問題。茲乘上海市參義會第六次大會開幕之便，特別提出幾個重要的現實問題，作全面的檢討，拋磚引玉，希望市參議員能以大家的智慧，探索出上海市的前途。</p>
<p>第一，糧食供應問題，不僅有關民生的安定，而且與上海市的治安問題，也有極密切關係；最近一週來，米價日漲夜大，已逾千萬大關；君其趨勢，米價的漲風，幾乎漫無止境，使全市五百萬市民莫不感受調「白色恐佈」的威脅；所謂「民以食為天」，糧食供應問題，若不能覓獲妥善的解決辦法，不僅民生不能安定，治安可慮；而且其他一切庶政，也就無從談起了。此次參議會正在米價瘋狂上漲聲中開會，自應特別注意這個日趨嚴重的民食問題。上海市是一個工商業的都會，人口稠密，據最近的統計，已超過五百萬人的紀錄，而在上海市的本身，並非漁米之鄕，所以全市五百萬市民的糧食，都是要取給於蘇·浙·皖三省以及自國外遝來的洋米。論米價，照理應該超過產區的米價；但是以上週最高的米價而論，本市米價仍在產區之下，不能不歸功於民調會的配售美米，惟美米的來源，終屬有限，市政當局若欲完全依賴美米來維持民食，是可恃而不可久恃，決非長久之計。目前　米尙能源源而來，本市配售美米仍將繼續，但是民食問題的　憂，是不容市政當局忽　的，而且尤應在此時未雨綢繆，防患於未然；否則糧食供應問蓬，終將爲上海市最大的憂息，最近常州寗波的搶米風潮，若　演到上海，則不僅治安無法維持，而且整個工商經濟也有被拖　之虞。所以我們不能不特別提高警覺！</p>
<p>第二，取　投機商人，根除物價上漲的人為因素。誰都承認，上海是全國經濟的中心，物價上漲的發源地，全國各地的物價，幾乎究全以上海爲標準，尤其是京杭等地的物價，與上海的物價亦步亦趨；物價上漲的因素，固然不一而足；但是物價每次上漲的幕後，總有人爲的因素存在。此所調人爲的因素，就是投機商人的囤積居奇以及從事黑市買賣。姑以金鈔而論，財政當局三申五令取締金鈔賣買，但是金鈔黑市依然存在，而且每次物價的漲風，都是由金鈔領導而促成的。政府當局特在滬，漢，穗，平，津五市設立金融管制局，負責取締金鈔黑市以及其他一切非法賣買。上海方面，自李立俠局長就任以來，對於黑市金鈔投機套匯，也有過好幾次的具體表現，破獲好幾件重大的案件，但是「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」，經營投機套匯，以及黑市金鈔的，依然故我。以致李局長辭職後，新任局長高方，又未到任，局長一席尙在虛懸物色中，而管理金融及取締投機的工作，亟持全面展開和高度的發揮，怎能任其停頓呢？投機雖爲工商都市不可避免的現象，尤其在今日的上海；但是市政當局如不設法取締，造成放任狀態；則其後果，不僅要時時刺激物價的上漲，而且也將危及工商業的本身。所以我們對於上海市投機之風的盛行，不能不引爲當前的　　，而要求市參鐵魚諸公，正視此一危機，提出取締投機的　實有效辦法來！</p>
<p>第三，上海市的繁榮是一種表面繁緊，並不能　　其內在的破爛；而且富者愈富，貧者愈貧的現象，日趨明朗，能也不能否認此一事實。因此我們在上海社會上，一面看到富有的　　淫逸，事盡都市物質文明的樂趣；但在上海社會的另一面，我們又看到窮苦者度着非人的生活。這兩極的對照，眞有「朱門酒肉具，野有餓死骨」之感，上海是人間的天堂，同時又是人間的地獄；最近幾月來，一方面因爲工商業的不景氣，有許多工廠無法維持，乃不得不倒閉，致使失業的工人一天多一天；另一方面又因戰亂區的擴大，難民　集上海，其中强者流爲盜賊，弱者淪爲乞丐，市府雖有難民收容所的般立，但不能解決這個嚴重的問題。衣不蔽體的難民充斥街頭，已不是有　市容的問題，而是一個嚴重的治安問題。所以解決失業及救濟難民，實在是刻不容緩的了。社會局對於此一問題，早已在計劃之中，但是迄未具體化；無論如何，在此時高唱「不給運動」，總不是一個辦法。</p>
<p>最後，還要向市政當局進一言：我國民主憲政業已跨步走上正軌，中央政制機構均已改革，面目一新；但在地方政制，依然如故，還未變動，實不能配合我國民主憲政的推行，故在目前本市當局應即積極準備，一俟立法院將省縣自治通則予以通過，本市立即制定市自治法，首先實行地方自治，民選市長，爲全國各省市的示範！</p>
<h3>楊妹研究委會昨開會　討論新階段考騐工作</h3>

<h3>西安楊妹　辟榖七年　也準備受檢驗</h3>
<p>〔本報西安廿日電〕因辟穀七年而哄傳長安之張貴卿女士，西安市立之市民醫院派員前往查訪，已接受伊父之請求，不日由院檢查，以視其爲「楊妹第二」，抑爲病態的不完全絕食。記者目睹此廿二歲之紅衣女郞，雖抹粉塗脂燙髮，然外表上之第二性徵似甚微隱，對男女事亦不表示任何反應。據伊父云：張女十三歲月經初潮，但旋即中斷，直迄現在，此似因營養不足至性機能備受影響之現象，如有異於重慶楊妹者。張女士十六歲起，因一度被驚恐，其後即不願進食物，苟勉强進餐，深感痛苦，非俟全部吐出不可。彼目前肌肉發育不良，腹部扁平，幾無大便，亦鮮小便，日常愛作女紅，愛吸新鮮空氣，厭惡煩擾熱鬧環境，凡此現象，則酷似楊妹。張女士每日晨午睡前三次，均喝開永兩杯，睡前一次加白糖兩小匙，偶爾或吃些少許水果，然一梨之微，足吃三日，亦非必需。此外絕無任何脂肪澱粉蛋白質入腹，以此僅有之食物，如何能支持身體熱量之長期出超，此有趣之問題，苟獲解決，當有助於楊妹式之謎之揭開或否定也。</p>

<h3>憑弔龍山　國軍建立了大濟南市的東部屛障　匪撕殺了三書四夜終於棄槍拋彈</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十六日航訊〕一個偶然的機會，我於今天正午憑弔了距濟卅五公里，在十小時前還是戰塲的龍山車站及其附近地區，在這裏，國軍同共匪拼殺了三畫四夜，至今天拂曉前兩小時，匪渤海縱隊於傷亡五千餘後，始棄彈拋槍抱頭鼠竄，經章邱北竄，而造成了山東戰塲昌濰戰役以來的國軍首次勝利。</p>
<p>雙方部署　國軍在這方面的部署是龍山及其東南山城莊駐一個團，龍山北婁家四戶一個團，西北之李官莊兩個團，西南之五里堂一個團，共爲五個團。共匪此次所使用的總兵力爲匪渤海縱隊袁也烈部新七·十一·十三·三個師及獨立十四·十五·十六團，共十二個團，除以五個團作預備隊外，第一錢共用了七個團，其中以三個團分攻婁家四戶，李官莊，五里堂，以牽制各該地國軍阻止各該地國家向龍山及小城莊國軍的增援，其主力四個團則圍攻龍山及其東南不到一里的山城莊，戰事自十二日晚八時同時爆發，匪的企圖首在消滅駐守龍山及山城莊的錢伯英旅譚星煌團，匪首渤海縱隊司令員嘗爲此開會三天，認爲一定仍可以其「圍城打援」「以大吃小」的老戰術把譚團「吃」掉後改換新裝備。譚團長以龍山地區遼闊，一團兵力太薄，故改以主力守龍山東南的高地山城莊，而以兩個連在外作機動策應。</p>
<p>奪回龍山　龍山以兵力薄弱，十二日夜即陷匪手，龍山旣失，山城莊之後方連絡即被切斷，匪乃以全力圍攻山城莊，譚團畏因部隊到達駐地使兩日，只可憑最草率的野戰工事以抵禦之，戰至十三日晨，錢柏英旅長因恐譚團有失，乃自濟南親率所部另外兩個團於日行七十里到達戰地後，即拐腹對龍山之詎展開反包圍在廿餘次肉搏簡鋒下終於當夜十二時將龍山鎭奪回。這時，匪圍攻山城莊益烈，企圖於龍山國軍未恢復疲勞前先佔領山城莊，但終經不住兩地國軍的聯合夾擊，匪四團兵力損失殆半，乃不得不於十五日黎明前向龍山東北潰退，同時攻擾婁家四戶五里堂等地之匪亦於受挫後相繼後撤。</p>
<p>攻于家莊　匪第一步撤至龍山東北約六七公里至十公里之黨家莊，于家莊，太平莊，二十里堡，黃三園一帶，錢旅長於擴大戰果追擊途中復將竄干家莊之匪新七師殘餘　　，而於十六日晨二時全部收復。僅該莊國軍所用砲彈即達千發，一位參謀吿訴我，目下的市價，平均一顆砲彈爲兩億元。錢旅長於攻于家莊之役親至莊東百公尺處指揮，匪的機槍打死了與他近在咫尺的他的勤務，打傷了他的侍從副官，但錢旅長則安然無恙。</p>
<p>新塜纍纍　我在龍山巡視時，日擊全　房屋不是被毀於砲火，就是被毀於燃燒彈，彈痕纍纍，死屍處處，微風過處，被焚房屋的焦味與屍臭所交織成的難以描摹的怪味，及今思之，猶令人作嘔無已。由龍山至山城莊間，戰壕交錯，積屍尤多，纍壘新塚，觸目皆是，錢旅長吿訴我，匪對屍首，原皆盡可能拖回自行掩埋，惟此次因國軍進軍神速，加以攻勢旺盛，故未及拖走，我們原來的計劃今天是可以把匪屍掩埋凈盡的，後來聽到你們要來，爲了要使你們明瞭戰事的激烈，因此方決定等你們看過後再掩埋。</p>
<p>關公倒仆　由山城莊復北行至于家莊，莊凡三百餘戶，完棟殘存無幾，莊西關帝廟亦被砲火所燬，關公遍身彈痕，倒仆斷垣之側，莊裏莊外，彈坑密如蜂窩，戰塲因尙未淸掃，彈殼彈片，軍帽，綁腿布等，觸目皆是，間尙有未爆炸砲彈一端埋入泥中，一端露於土外，故我等過時，咸抱戒心，匪屍亦因留待我等參觀，未盡掩埋，羣蠅　集，屍臭與火藥味相間，又另有一番難聞氣息。莊內有小天主堂一座，門窗屋頂，彈痕雖遍，但因建築堅固，故大致尙完整，禮拜堂內聖瑪利亞像仍懸揖其間，莊嚴慈祥，一如往昔。似爲戰後和平的徵象。出莊時，我們看到成羣的　馬和牛車，正運着大批甫登塲的新麥向西輸運，有人問他向那裏運時，他說：「這次八路幾乎把我們的麥子搶割一空，不是國軍追　得快，恐怕連這一些也早被八路搶走了」</p>
<p>官兵一致　整七十三師自去年二月廿三日萊蕪吐絲口之役被「吃」後，完全是山東地方團隊改編的。由於缺乏作戰經騐，關於戰鬭力，大家一向不敢對他作過高的佔計，但年來由於曹振鐸錢伯英諸將軍的切實訓練，更由於王耀武所倡導的新作風運動之切實推行，在此次龍山之戰中，可設已收穫最圓滿的成果。在戰地視察歸來途中，一位下級軍官向我說得好：「只有戰塲是最講民主，也是最講平等的地方，無論官兵，只要在火綫上，無論吃的，住的，用的，甚至死的機會都是一律平等的。只有到了後方，官兵生活就被隔離成爲絕對懸殊的兩個階層的人了」。但該軍官接着又說：「以上只是過去的事，自王司令官倡導新作風遝動後，官兵生活，已打成一片，大家同上操塲，同上講堂，同休息，同吃大鍋菜，以至同上戰塲，官畏之於土兵，正如家長之於子弟，在這種情形下的部隊怎會再不打勝仗呢」？</p>
<p>由於龍山戰役的勝利，正如該師曹師長所說：增强了渠對該部原有戰　力兩倍以上的信心，同時也更穩定了在圍城中的濟市七十萬市民的心情，這兒建立了大濟南市的東面的一個堅强的屛障。（特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>談歐陸局勢</h3>
<p>— 本耿</p>
<p>戰爭會爆發嗎？　（一）</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰在事實上已經結束了兩年多，不但主要的和約——對日與對德——還很渺茫，並且全世界特別是歐洲大陸似乎已經在醞釀着另一次戰爭。在不到一年的時間中，歐洲大陸從馬歇爾計劃之提出與東歐各國之拒絕參加，中間經過國際共產黨情報局之成立，希臘反政府軍之組織政府，四國外長倫敦會議之不歡而散，五國公約之簽訂，捷克政變與小馬薩里克之自殺，蘇聯對美國在伊朗軍事顧問之抗議，修改對意和約之提出，以及最近發生之柏林在英美佔領區之交通問題。每一件問題之發生，一方固然表示局勢之逆轉，它方也或多或少的加深歐局之緊張。對立的局勢或多或少的已經成立了。</p>
<p>那邊是以蘇聯爲中心之東歐集圍，大約包括着十個左右的國家，這邊是由五國公約到以馬歇爾援歐計劃爲中心之西歐十六國。雖則還剩下一些國家，但是看來未必能够發生緩和局勢的作用，甚至於這些國家也未得能够長久自存於兩大之外。有人把今日之局勢比之於一九一四年及一九三八年兩次大戰的前夕，只有一點是與一九一四及一九三八年大不相同的，即在一九一四及一九三八年的戰爭前夕，美國多少是置身事外的狀態。現在呢，地署的距離雖仍如昔，而在政治上美國不但參加了歐洲的斜紛，並且還是最重要的主角之一</p>
<p>目前的情形，是：已經產生而未解決的問題，固然很多，而將要發生以及階時可能發生的問題，似乎也到處皆是。因此，有人在討論或者在想戰爭是否又要爆發呢？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我想我們不必直接的對這個問題作答，而只要分析一下戰爭之可能若何。</p>
<p>認爲戰爭就要爆發者，理由大約是這樣的：現在的國際形勢固然複雜，如果把它簡單化，那麼整個局勢是美國與蘇聯的對立，這個對立，代表着兩種不同的社會制度與思想、戰爭是不可能避免的。旣然是不可能避免的，自然就隨時可以爆發。詳細的分析，有幾個因素，可能使戰爭很快爆發。第一，雙方不管是基於「自衛」或其他理由，很明顯的都在採取着各種各式的手段，來防範對方。這樣的你一着我一着，雖則在下棋者只是佈局，但是愈佈愈緊，隨便那一着棋如果由你看來是自衛或許你估計對方可以忍受，而在事實上對方却認爲超過了自衛或許認爲不能忍受時，戰爭即可隨之而起。現在似乎已經到了愈佈愈緊的程度了。第二，在美國方面可能很自信的認爲它的經濟的力量足以立即支持一個大規模戰爭，而且現在是已公開的握有原子彈的唯一國家，這樣如果認爲戰爭是不可免的，可能希望在對方實力充沛以前作戰。假定美國果然有人有此想頭的話（當然，這個假定由有些人看來，是很可能的），則戰爭自然不會太遠。第三，在蘇聯方面，有兩個相反的情形而使它出來製造戰爭。其一，蘇聯或許也已經有了原子彈（一度傳說蘇聯於去夏在西伯利亞試騐原子彈），或許雖則沒有原子彈但是却認爲原子彈並不足以決定勝負，或許對於美國目前所已有的原子彈歡量與以很低的估計，而在歐洲大陸上面、蘇聯可能會自信能够「無敵」，在這個情形之下，可能使蘇聯感覺到戰爭旣不可免，則與其等待西歐各國之復興，母寗先下手爲强。其二，蘇聯可能過份估計美國力量之强大，而使它不自主的在無限制的擴大它的「生存圈」，這種無限制的擴大「生存圈」，不論主觀上是否爲了「安全感」，客觀上必將迫使戰爭之早日到來。　（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕海關全體職工怠工事件，迄仍遷延未決，該處員工代表爲闡明此次怠工眞相，昨發表談話如次；「海關待遇較四行二局，郵局相差甚遠，爲爭取待遇之澈底改善，乃有福利會之組織，比照四行二局辦法改善待遇，提出已有很久。前俞部長及總稅務司亦曾面允，一俟政府改組完成，即向部長力爭。邇來物價飛漲，同人生活已瀕絕境，端節之前，全體同人乃簽名呈請當局借薪一月，以資救濟，當局迄未置答後，同人爲生活所逼，本月十八日午福利會代表循全體同人之請，再度　見總稅務司要求三點：（一）承龍爲改善特遇而組織之　利會為合法。（二）要求比照四行二局辦法改藝海關待遇，在改善以前，實行發給職員米貼二石六斗，工役一石六。（三）借給薪津一個月，以資救濟，對此三項要求，當局均無圓滿答復，福利曾代表被逼全體辭職，談判成僵局，即日下午海關工作，遂入停頓狀態。十九日以當局仍無具體答覆，此種狀態繼續一天，廿日報載午後四時江海關已局部復工，茲鄭重聲明，此項消息不確，我全體員工，除非三項要求獲得完滿答復，決定堅特到底。由於此次事件所引起之各方損失，其責任全歸海關當局所負，員工爲生活所逼，且爲澈底改善特遇以免再次發生起見，深信當可獲得各方之諒解與同情。又前日大美及大睦各西報對於海關同人改善待遇之純正要求，歪曲事實，橫加誣衊，除聊表其別具用心外，自不値識者一笑」。</p>

<h3>德埡古職工　配給火油爭執</h3>
<p>美商德士古火油公司之職工，前因該公司自四月份起取銷職工每月三總之配給火油，經工會方面提出交涉後，公司方面僅允發給一聽，致引起職工方面之激憤，曾由工會報請社會局調處。現資方已允四月份配給一聽，五月份配給二聽，六月份配給三聽，售價方面則須照市價每聽二百八十八萬元計算，並限定在昨日一次繳足，先後三聽，餘三聽則暫緩配給。該項措施較之工會之要求該項火油配價應照四月五日八十二萬元，五月五日一百十四萬元，六月五日一百六十四萬元之配價計算，雙方標準相距甚　。職工方面認爲在數量上業已對資方作極天之讓步，今　方又擭提高舊價，顯係　意刁難，職工方面對資方之　價攤準，業已拒絕，情緒極爲激昻。</p>

<h3>上海楊妹　不知去向　兩醫師將其遷出黃寓　三日來觀察結果　似患間歇不食症</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「上海楊妹」張黛琳不食之謎，現已在華淑君及李霖兩醫師合力檢騐之下，終吿揭破。根據三日來實地觀察結果，李醫師認爲張女似有間歇性之不食症，渠每隔三日稍進水菓，可能係一種病態，與重慶楊妹完全不食根本異趣。渠之所以致此，除基於其身世之動機現尙無法探悉外，主要原因恐仍係由於消化機構特別衰竭而起。此種病症戰前蘇聯曾發現多次，但在我國尙屬罕見。華李兩醫師現已將張女口腔唾沫，子宮分泌物，及大小便等搜集齊全，並加以培養，視其究含何種細菌，俾證實前述理論是否正確。同時另一方面，張女在廿日表示不願再吃香蕉，而將蘋果兩只剝皮搗爛，用開水浸熱後服下，由此可見張女三日一次之進食似並不絕對規律。聞華李兩醫師爲欲循科學途徑及用護士日夜伴隨之方法，以徹底尋求張女不食秘奧起見，昨已將渠遷離黃麟書寓所，但遷往何處，則秘而不宣。至今後對張女處置問題，各有關方面並無熱烈表示，據黃麟書表示，渠將來亦不擬再予留養。</p>

<h3>美輪載來援華物資　航界盼仍在滬起卸　希望美方取消駛入長江之議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳我國政府將特許載運援華物資之美籍船隻駛入長江至南京漢口兩埠，本市航業界對於此事極爲注意。昨據輸船業秘書長李雲良向記者談稱：航業界懇切希望美國方面取消此議而將援華物資在上海卸貨，交由我國輪船轉運，因國營及民營輪船公司爲配合美援之運用，早經決定對於美援物資由沿海口岸轉往內地列爲優先運輸，保證迅速便利，遝費亦可特別優待。就目前沿海及長江貨運情形而論，上海開往各綫之船隻，貨運均極稀少，尤以長江船上水運往南京·九江·漢口一帶之貨載不足三成。美援物資轉口之數量佔計不過五萬噸，運入長江者猶使其中一都份，故在貨運噸位上實已供過於求，轉運毫無困難。且長江水道在戰爭期中佈置之各種障　物至今未能清除，航行標誌亦不完備，即吃水十五呎以下之內河輪船航行亦極困難，常有擱淺碰撞等意外事件，而內地港口裝卸又極遲緩，效率僅及上海三分之一。外洋輪船吃水多在二十呎以上，如駛入長江，在航行上之困難，裝卸上之躭誤及領江等費用之浩大，均不合算。美方或以上海轉口費用高為理由，實則由於外匯黑市之飛騰，轉口費用折成外匯爲數無幾，而上海碼頭工人則可大受其益，當此各地難民來滬日多，政府正苦無法救濟之際，美國對我之援助，自當儘量顧及此種民生有關之社會問題，故從航運，經濟，社會三方面檢討，援華物資仍以在滬卸貨為宜。李氏最後並強調航業界離　內河航行繼及反對開放京漢等內河港埠之決心，指出其他國家如英國等對於在華航行特權仍極　念，故如政府以援助物資關係而不得已對美籍船隻進入長江加以臨時之特准，則亦僅以綫運援華物資之美船爲限，不得視爲開放內河港埠，其他並無援華物資運來之國家更不得援以為例，此則我政府必須堅持，全國人民尤當共同警惕云。</p>

<h3>般物價　上週銀根鬆濫　漲勢方興未艾</h3>
<p>這一次物價的大漲風，起於本月份第一週之末，當時美方削减援外經費，我國部份减少六千三百萬元，運用日期延長至十五個月，消息傳來，刺激物價一致　漲，此種漲勢，經前週而延緻至上週末，似尙在方興未艾之中。</p>
<p>上週本刋所編之批發物價總指數計上升百分之二七·五八，分類指數中，食物，紡織品，化學品，建築材料等類，均升百分之廿以上，燃料類升百分之卅以上。當局對於這一次物價漲風的對策，除仍採抽緊銀根的老法外，並未見新的措施，其實最近數月以來，銀根始終在鬆弛狀態中，兼之華北資金，不斷南流，已早有泛濫爲災之勢，殊非各種治標的辦法所能爲力。</p>
<p>我們由現在看來，政府如不能即時在停止通貨膨脹上着手，不僅高度的漲風無法戢止，將坐視危機加速的到來。</p>
<p>上週銀根，仍極鬆濫，國行交換情形，除偶因拋售物資結款關係外，差進額均不到萬億，而國行同業定存，幾經常在二萬億以上，暗息三角以內走動。</p>
<p>談到當前的通貨膨脹，這是造成物價漲風最根本的原因，也是政府最無法應付的惡症。我們從最近的財政狀况看，一是本刋上期已經論及的預算數字，預計今年下半年度的支出額約達三百六十萬億元。一是財長王雲五於本月十六日向立法院財政金融委員會的報吿，據稱：「截止目前，法幣發行額爲一三五萬億元，五月份之收人爲十五萬億元，支出爲七十五萬億元。</p>
<p>看到這種財政狀况以後，我們自然會明白物價爲什麼要漲，一切措施爲什麼終歸無效，而鉅額的支出與大量的發行，物價的上漲，支出額再增加又有着不可分離的循環關係，所以當局對於今後物價的對策，若不能另闢天地，從根本處想辦法，而仍在現狀下兜圈子，那是絕不會有奇蹟發現的。</p>
<p>上週政府平抑物價漲風唯一的辦法可說仍是拋售物資，但拋者自拋，漲者自漲，收效甚微，據說當局也很苦惱，頗有檢討個中原因的意思。</p>
<p>我們可以指出：（一）政府拋售物資的價格，完全在追隨市價，本身並沒有一個穩定的價格。如週五紗管會配出二十支紗售價，多迫近四億元，四十二支紗亦多在六億元以上，十二磅雙燈細布爲一，二七〇萬元。臺糖配價亦隨台匯之調整而提高，週一合匯匯率爲四四五元，週二四六三元，週四四七七元，週五五〇六元，週末五二一元。</p>
<p>（二）政府因掌握物資有限，拋售政策，舉棋不定，如民調會的拋售食米，時拋時停，對於糧食市塲的管制，一時迫令限價出售，一時恢復自由市塲，如此做法，實充分表現政府的窘態，同時更給投機家以大展身手的機會。</p>
<p>此外金融設施方面，金管局已核准票據當日抵用，並即日試辦，規定：「（一）行莊公司對於存入票據請求當日抵用之客戶，應審愼調查其信用，認爲可予抵用者，令其覓具股實保證人。簽立『票據抵用保證書」後，方得准予抵用。</p>
<p>（二）行莊公司應將訂約抵用之客戶戶名，帳號，住址及保證人姓名等，抄報金管局備案。如行莊公司認爲該客戶信用不佳或有不穩情事，得隨時呈報金管局停止其抵用，但一經呈報，對於該客戶不得再行申請恢復抵用。</p>
<p>（三）凡濫發空頭支票之客戶，連續發生退票三次者，除照向例由行莊公司報吿公會通函同業停止該戶往來外，並應據實呈報金管局，視其情節，得向法院檢舉，依法提出公訴，各該往來行莊公司應負提供證件之責。」由此看來，金管局儘可於當　制訂管理辦法，防杜弊端，何必禁止票據當日抵用，以致市塲上頓生許多風波。</p>
<p>上週市塲物價光勢，波濤汹湧，挺秀異常，報張多用「狂漲」字樣描寫，以顯其態勢。股市方面，因圈外物價高漲，多創新價，永紗於週五以四，二七〇元高價收盤。紗布方面，四十二支藍鳳於週五破六億關，廿一雙馬破四億關，龍頭細布站一，二九五元高價，均創新紀錄。糧食上週因產價報漲，到貨稀少，靑黃不接等多種原因，不斷上升，當局於週二起，宣布糧食市塲，再恢復限價，規定白粳門售價一千萬元，民調會每兩日拋米六千石，但如此一來，舖中無上等米應市，市塲亦少做開，聞週末上白粳塲外喊價，已超出一千二百萬元</p>
<p>日用品如肥皂，火柴，香烟等，亦上升極猛，週末固本皂迫二千萬，美麗火柴升達七·四〇〇萬，五百支大英烟升達三五〇萬。餘如化學品，建築材料等，亦均迭創新價。</p>

<h3>貨幣金融</h3>
<p>（一）銀根暗息</p>
<p>上週本市銀根，呈現出一種游資的泛濫與抽緊相互搏鬥的局面，一週來幾乎每天不是盛傳當局將拋售大量物資以抽緊銀根，便是風聞國家行局將有鉅額的差進，這似乎是一種神經戰，在片刻的短時間內，這種神經戰術也發生了一些作用，但是時間久了，事實的眞相揭露了，局面就頓時改觀，一週來，市塲暗息的晨高夕降，恰是一種相應的反映，因爲無論業內業外，如果風聞銀根將趨緊，總不免搜羅一些頭寸放着，作爲不急之需，但假如後來知道以前的想法不太正確，那末，市面上頭寸的供源又必然旺盛，暗息也降低了。</p>
<p>上週自週一至週三，午前的暗息大致昻達三角，但午後一則因外埠游資紛紛運來，二則因當局抽緊銀根乏力，終又回跌至二角七分，至於週四週五兩天，暗息大致站住二角七分，游資勢力的頑强可以想見其一二了。</p>
<p>平心說來，自週一至週五，國家行局的差進數額不能算小，包括同業存款在內，五天共差進達四萬二千九百億之多，較前週增進達一萬二千多億，即扣除同業定存共二萬〇六百億不計，行局實進亦達二萬二千餘億，與前週相較，增進幾及二萬億之多。然而，衆所週知，通貨膨脹，遍及各處，無論前綫後方，鈔票皆在增發，至於拋售物資以抽緊銀根，僅以本市一地爲主要，自然，當上週華北東北以至蘇浙內地游資紛紛抵達本市的時際，本市區區物資，又安能匹敵，　銀根的鬆弛如舊，可謂未出意料。</p>
<p>至於在若干時日後，由於游資泛濫，競買風行，物價高漲，需單殷切而使銀根一時轉斂，雖然也是必有的現象，但這不能僅僅看作是一種週而復始的簡單循環，　實證明，每次銀根鬆勢，不但與往次有量上的區別，即在性質上，亦一次比一次嚴重，而且銀根一鬆一緊的間歇，也有縮短的趨勢，惡性通貨膨脹的嚴重，亦在此點。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹愈劇烈，資金的逃避亦愈加　，洋商銀行差進額之增加，不過表示資金外逃的一端而已，上週自週一至週五，洋商銀行共差進一萬五千四百九十九億，較前週增進一倍强，據說大部係賣出外匯之收入。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，百物雖迭見上騰而搜單亦呈殷切，但以行莊存底豐厚，同業拆放仍未見盛做，上週六十號以後行莊，交換結果。共差出三萬七千九百九十五億，較前週尤增出一萬五千八百多億，但以現鈔籌碼充斥，行莊解現以抵補缺單者，自週一至週五爲數亦在二萬億以上，業內頭寸不因間接交換之增出而拮据，亦以此故，</p>
<p>（二）內外匯率</p>
<p>上週外匯行市，基準率未動，結匯證明書漲勢凶猛，週一價格不過五十四五萬，但週五已高至一百十萬左右，五天內計漲一倍。香港申匯亦迭見猛縮，週一至週三爲三角一分，週四縮至二角八分，週五再見縮短。香港黃金每華兩週一爲三百二十八港元，週四亦縮至三百二十五元，香港美元市價週一爲五元四角八分，週三週四亦縮四分左右。</p>
<p>上海內匯行市，穗匯匯水除週四一度減十元為一百四十元外，其他幾天，均為一百五十元，　匯匯水，前週末爲一百元，上週週一提至一百廿元，至週五再提升爲一百五十元，資金南流之加劇，亦可看出一二。重慶匯率週一二爲平匯，週三起改爲貼水四十元，可測重慶一帶資金流入本市者亦不少。漢匯匯水週一爲四十元，週二對加一倍，週三减爲五十元，但後又增加，週五已達七十元。</p>
<p>前有本市資金先匯漢口再匯華南之事實，此次當亦不免，津匯貼水以週三週四爲最高，各為一百五十元及一百二十元，其他數天亦在一百元以上，北資南來，其勢依舊。</p>
<p>（三）華洋股市</p>
<p>週初，外埠游資，續有到滬，銀根仍鬆，外象物資，紛紛報漲，華股空頭大戶，雖頻施壓力，仍未見効，永紗於臨收一刻鐘內，突然暴漲，創三千九百十五元新高價。其他各股一致軋升。</p>
<p>週二登塲，開始均露秀色，永紗曾出四千大關，新光景福等小型股，俱向高峯推進，旋聞美衆院撥款委員會對華貸款案，恢復至四千六百萬美元，買氣轉餒，永紗遂不支，破入三千九百元以內。其他各股亦多由高峯下降。</p>
<p>週三初開，形勢大變，蓋以連漲匝旬，人心居高思危，紛紛獲利了結，賣氣漸盛，永紗最低曾破入三七〇〇關，旋以銀根仍鬆，又曾叩三八〇〇關。各股一致軋跌。</p>
<p>週四，因外象仍見飛騰，人心振奮，買氣又盛，永紗以四〇七〇元新高價出現。成交數額亦極多云。</p>
<p>週五游資續有大量湧到，普吿騰升，永紗做四二七〇元，美亞信和等十一種漲停。</p>
<p>週末因臨假期，當局又有抑平漲風之說，各股多見小回，永紗以四一一〇元收盤。</p>
<p>洋股行市，本週承上週漲風，橋續高翔，週　銀根鬆弛，港匯報縮，外象飛機，怡紗升達六三〇萬元，英聯出七百萬大關，會德豐創一千五百萬元新高價，如火如荼，面目全新。週二仍形堅倘，一致軋漲，怡紗做六五五萬元，英聯昻至七五〇萬，業廣自一七〇萬漲至一八〇萬元。</p>
<p>週三港匯報平，突聞當局管制加緊，多頭紛紛出籠，市勢一致回疲，怕紗降至六二〇萬元，英聯跌四十萬元，會德豐趨低七十萬元，業廣挫落二十萬元。週四黑市飛騰，外象物資均升，銀根又鬆，外股遂亦重現高價，怡紗升至六七三萬元。英聯做七五八萬元，會德豐叩一千七百萬大關。</p>
<p>週五因黑市混亂，其他物價飛漲關係，買氣極盛一時，會德豐叩一八〇〇萬大關。英聯爲八三〇萬元。怡紗上揚至七六〇萬元。週末因金鈔暗市高漲，各股續見盤升，如怡紗以七七〇萬元收盤，較上日升十萬元。</p>
<h3>工商動態　日貨威脅的陰影</h3>
<p>日本的復興以及日貨的到處流竄，無疑的，已經構成了中國民族工商業致命的咸脅，影響所及，即東方的其他國家，亦深覺惶惶不安，據聯合社馬尼刺電訊，馬尼刺時報撰文嘲稱：「近衛公雖死，其精神尙生存在美國國務部，其大東亞共榮圈之夢想，仍在白宮南面大鳴。」</p>
<p>馬尼刺紀事報則呼召中國，印度，緬甸，暹羅與東印聯絡菲律賓一致拒絕對日貿易，但中國方而，官方或半官方之態度均欠明顯，據中央社東京電訊，中日私人貿易終吿展開，自上月下旬以還，東京中國商人，已開始與日商談判，所談之交易達廿起左右，同時，中信局方面，亦不顧二區毛紡織業的反對，繼續標售日貨呢絨，至前週爲止，前後已達三次，毛紡織業雖一再要求該局停止拋售日貨，亦迄無成效。</p>
<p>日貨的侵入除採正當的貿易一途徑而外，尙利用各式各樣的走私的方法，據華東社消息，日貨有利用賠償物資之船隻以　運來華者。至日貨流竄之對象，除中國大陸及南洋一帶外，香港朮爲一良好的地點，日貨「傾銷」香港，雖曾引起在港華商團體的激烈反對與抗議，但據合衆社十三日香港電訊，港方對日貿易，尙無予以限制之意，理由爲香港工業，在自由市塲中尙不足與人競爭之故。據悉現在由日本進口香港的貨物約五十種，主要者爲生絲，人造絲，疋頭，編織物及絨綫，呢絨，磁器等等。本年度首五個月，日貨抵港即達三千五百萬港元之鉅。</p>
<p>紡織品外銷委員會爲推廣紡織品外銷，獲取外匯頭寸起見，最近曾擬訂本年紗布外銷計劃，計劃中的紗布外銷之數量佔全國產量百分之二十，折合棉紗計算爲三十萬件，另擬銷售棉紗四萬件，棉布八百萬疋，據估計，可售得美金七千五百八十七萬五千元。銷售之對象，以南洋羣島及近東菲洲爲主，印度南美亦推銷一部份。</p>
<p>便這樣一個計劃是否能順利付諸實施，頗成疑問，例如最近經濟部會電紗管會及紡織品外銷委員會，說明在菲島一處，年來即以日本紡織品的大量湧進，而造成我紡織品市塲的一再萎縮，據說其主要原因爲我國貨品質不及日美貨，而價格高於日貨，且長度不　標準化，美貨布疋尺碼，每疋皆較原定長度多出半碼，日貨亦能足數，而國產布疋尺碼常缺少半尺或一尺不等，故不易受人歡迎，尤不能與美日布疋競爭，該地經營紡織品之僑商，甚至亦大多經營美日紡織品。如上所述，我國紡織品之能否順利外銷，前途實頗爲暗淡。</p>
<p>以上所舉，不過是日本復興後，對中國民族工商業所構成的最初影響之一端而已！至於其他軍事政治方面的影響，恐更將嚴重於此吧！</p>

<h3>科學生，迷信死</h3>
<p>— 劉咸</p>
<p>因本市跑馬應側之石翁仲，受愚夫愚婦之朝夕膜拜者，香火甚盛，過其旁者　駐足以觀，馴至交通阻塞，有碍市容，經市政府鄭重其事，召開會議，下令取締，將所懸披彩　額，一掃而空，識者稱之。乃有迷信者流，自附於佛門弟子之列，具呈法院控訴主管當局以妨碍人民信仰自由之罪；又或有善男信女，富裕多資，主張購地建寺，以資供奉。兼旬以來，此不應成問題之陋事，時見於各報本埠新聞，竟成爲一般人茶餘酒後之談論資料，事之滑稽，孰逾於此，吾人本科學觀點，覩茲現象，不勝感嘆，爲正視聽，詞而闢之。</p>
<p>現在科學進步，日新月異，目大戰吿終，吾人已進入原子時一代，世界列强莫不兢兢業業，從事於高深科學研究之探討，以期有所發明，藉以恢復戰後國力。改善民生，貢獻學術，造福人羣，乃吾國一般人民不知科學研究爲何事，更不自知其所處之時代，知識貧乏，頭腦冬烘，竟開倒一車，退步至拜物主義（Fetishism），物靈崇拜（Animism），可笑孰甚。吾人以爲國家貧弱係一時現象，不難轉變，惟大多數人民愚昧無知，最堪隱憂，蓋方今世界競爭，愈演愈烈，國於大地，必有以立，民族强盛，端賴學術，列强科學發皇，精益求精，而我乃求籤問卜，迷信神權，渾渾噩噩，不識不知，程度相空，何啻霄壤，欲以此種愚妄之人民，競爭於現代科學進步之性界，其不被天然之淘汰者幾稀。</p>
<p>復次，上海爲吾國通都大埠一，開關至早，百餘年來與西方文一明不斷接觸，舉凡科學新發明之應用，現代生活之享受，上海輒一得風氣之先，更以以前租界關係，華洋雜處，歐風美雨，濡染甚深，乃不謂時至今日，上海市民仍有膜拜路旁石人之怪現象演出，說者以爲可笑，吾人爲可痛。此蓋由於吾國科學落後，敎育猶未普及，致令一般人民雖居住在五百萬人口，西化已深之上海；然而但知物質享受，生活奢糜，不識科學貢獻爲何事。推而言之，此種但知迷信神鬼，缺乏科學常識之人民，實無資格居住於日見現代之上海，例如電之爲用至廣，苟無相當電學常識，　其用電而不致　禍，即屬大幸。</p>
<p>科學與迷信，勢不兩立。大凡迷信甚深之國家，科學必不發　，反之，科學進步之國家，必不容迷信之存在。迷信愈深，民智愈塞，科學愈明，進步愈速。我國數千年來，缺乏科學，人民過事不求甚解，養成以耳代目之風，結果穿鑒附曾，迷信百出，跑馬廳膜拜翁仲之事，特其一端，弊之所至，遣害無窮。吾人以爲凡屬科學工作者，於致力發展吾國科學事業外，更宜隨時隨地從事迷信之破除，蓋在科學發展過程中，迷信爲莫大之障碳，根深蒂固，牢不可破，障礙一不除去，即科學一日不得自由發展，亦即國家現代化，不能迅速實現。故灌輸科學知識，解釋科學原理於一般民衆，實屬切要之問，俾向之迷信者，恍然大悟，民智旣開，風氣自轉，迷信自絕。所望負各級敎育任者，尤其以訓練民衆爲職志者，對於破除迷信，多加之意，亦即所以間接助長科學之發展，則在不久將來，吾國科學事業蒸蒸日上，福國利民，裨益無窮，迷信事例，將永久絕跡於中國矣。英儒赫胥黎（Thomas　Henry　Huxley）有言：「科學生，迷信死」，願爲國人誦之。</p>
<h3>原子核趣話</h3>
<p>— 王德乾</p>
<p>原子核的密度</p>
<p>通常當比較幾種不同化合物或元素的物理性時，我們首先總少不了要提出各種化合物的密度（Density）和比重（Gravity），譬如我們拿水和硫酸來作比較吧，第一得說出水的密度是每立方厘米（即每C．C．）重一克，而硫酸的密度比水重一·八倍，即每立方厘米的硫酸重一·八克·其次再比較它們的色，味，噢。</p>
<p>但這些在原子核中說起來就根本不適用，因爲每種元素的原子核，它的密度都是一樣，即使稍有參差，其數也甚微；——不過這裏要聲明的一點就是。元素的密度和原子核的密度絕對不同——原子核的密度差不多是等於每立方厘米重14／10克或寫成1000，000，000，000，000克，這個數字在現代的圈圈社會裏，看來也不過如此，但它在化學的範圍中已經是相當可觀了，因爲沒有一種元素或化合物的密度可和它比美、而且你要是肯再計算一下的話，會更使你驚異，如果要是你能夠得到1C．C．的核質（Stuff　Nuclei），那就會有100，000，000噸那麼重，這個數字比美國全年所產的鋼鐵量，還不知要大多倍呢！</p>
<p>原子核的火燄</p>
<p>有人對於這個名詞一定會感到新奇，因爲我們只知道普通的火與燄，但爲什麼又有了原子核火燄呢？其實並不奇突，所謂原子核火燄，就梵當原子核分裂的那一剎那所產生的能、與所放射的射綫的一種代名詞，但爲什麼不用別的字眼而徧要用「火燄」呢？這也有相當的理由，因爲當你要去點燃一個普通火燄時，必一須要有大氣中氟氣的供給，同樣一的你要去啓發一個原子核的火燄，也須要大氣中「中子」（Neutron）的帮助；當你要使火燄繼續保持時必須要有多量的煤，在原子核的火燄中也是一樣的，當你要使原子核繼續分裂，而不斷的產生　形反應（Chain　Reaction），必須對於鈾二三五，有一個「中肯大小」或「臨界大小」（Critical　Size），其他像平常的火能產生可見的光和熱，原于核火燄也產生射綫，但這射綫的威力確比火的光和熱大上不知多少倍，有了上面這些相同的地方，所以就有上面原子核火燄這名詞的產生。</p>
<p>不過一個名詞不能究究全全的代表一件事實或物質的本質，原子核火熖也有與普通火熖不同的地方，最主要的也就是現在稱爲原子時代的理由，普通的火熖須要大量的燃料而所放出的能並不多，但原子核火熖所須的燃料只是區區的一點，而所放出的能是相當的膨大，這次戰爭的結束也就是運用了這新型的火熖。再說，普通燃煤所剩的灰只是一種廢料，但「原子灰」中包含了無數的放射性同位元素（Rodroisotopes），這些放射性同位素是醫學上之寳。</p>
<p>末了，我們希望原子火熖，只是工業的原動力，而原子灰爲醫藥的研究資料，不要移作別用才好！</p>
<h3>新的科學兵器</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>護身裝甲</p>
<p>美國陸軍兵器專家，目前即將完成一種柔韌的護身裝甲，使步行的士兵有適當的保護，死傷亡率必可减低。</p>
<p>近代的步兵是　　機動性的，若叫他們去携帶笨重的配備及其他必需的武器，已很不適當，在戰塲上，這些步行的士兵又無適當的保護。兵器專家於是創製護身裝甲，有保護身體的功效，而無阻碍機動性的缺點。此種護身裝田是很適合狙擊兵，隨軍工程人員，戰塲攝影記者，當肅淸地雷工作時，工兵尤需要這種柔韌的護身裝甲。</p>
<p>火箭引擎</p>
<p>美國海軍當局最近發表：目一前已造成一　試臉性的火箭引擎一，定名爲摩別狄克（Moby—Cick），可說是世界上最强力的火箭引擎。能在二秒鐘內，產生六萬六千磅之推力，較之德國VZ火箭之向前衡量，尙大三分之一。火箭引擎之圓筒長達一百零五吋，直徑十七吋，重量一千五百磅，其中一半是固體燃料之重量</p>
<p>探索目標的雷達</p>
<p>英國海軍中，現在應用一種最新式以雷達設備，稱爲自動追索器（A．F．Dvice，）當雷達發出有敵機飛近的警號時，祇要撥　目動追索器上之機鈕，天綫就立即開始自動搜索天空中之敵機。數秒鐘後，即能確定敵機的目標。當此器找到目標時，就發出綠色的燈光，而天綫就自動追隨天空目標的移動，自動記錄目標經過的途程，和其連度方向等。同時此器械可和高射砲位相連繫，藉電力而使高射砲發砲射擊敵機，而擊中率極高。（續完）</p>
<h3>何以熱天吃得少</h3>
<p>— 同高</p>
<p>動物和人類的</p>
<p>體內究竟是什麼奇妙的機關，吿訴他們飽和餓的呢？科學家向來以爲飢餓的感覺，食慾，和飽滿之感，是由胃腸的活動，或者是由所謂味官而來的。現在，兩個耶魯大學的科學家却提出了一個新意見。耶魯大學醫學院的勃洛貝克博士（Dr．John　Brobeck）和郞博士（Dr．C．N．Long）以爲吃食的迫切需要，實是一種保持體溫的需要。因此，當寒暑表升上去的時候，食物的消耗便有减少的傾向，而身體的活動也减慢了。相反的，當寒暑表落下來時，食量和活動力就增加　來了。</p>
<p>氣溫有變化時發生在人們之一問的，有許多機有趣事情都可以用這學說來解釋。譬如，足球隊在溫暖的十月天氣中，飽餐了一頓以後，就變得昏昏欲睡，便是一個例子。在極炎熱的天氣人們的失去食慾，又是一個例子。</p>
<p>勃洛貝克和郞博士曾證明，當動物在熱的環境中時，牠就會少吃食物，但仍能升高牠的體溫。</p>
<p>他們把老鼠放在房間裏，使房間裏的溫度起變化，從華氏六十五度以至九十七度不等。結果，當溫度升高時，老鼠愈吃愈少，到九十四度時差不多不吃什麼了。而在七十二度時的老鼠與在九十四度時的老鼠比較起來，食物的攝取量竟相差別到百分之四百！</p>
<p>勃洛貝克博士說，凡是能消化食物的細胞，這個學脫都可以應用，幷且人類的行爲也同樣可以適合這個一般的範型。</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>生活記趣</h3>
<p>— 劉遂生</p>
<p>天氣和暖，衆果俱繁，浮瓜沈李之餘；余　復爲余手調梅醬，盛意慇懃，喜出非望！</p>
<p>但見碧水沸騰，靑梅上下，泡沫一生，余妻隨以銅勺撇除，以求純潔。余曰：「銅質不可用，因水果多含有機酸，與銅化合，生成有機酸銅、有大毒也。」余妻曰：「稍用諒無大礙。一經數度撇沫後，乃傾出梅湯，分盛兩杯，余一嘗試，覺酸甜之外，略有異味。余妻曰：「物力維艱，暴殄可惜！一遂盡一杯。未幾腹痛，大吐始己、不勝悽愴！</p>
<p>夏日炎炎，北窗高臥，忽聞時囂聲，知水夫屑水來矣！余曰：「余不惜重價，務求純粹河水。」水夫曰：「是純河水也！」余乃當面實騐；先取已備純河水，滴入硝酸銀液，其色不變；次取純井水來，注以硝酸銀液，則生乳白色沈澱，頗類豆漿；更取水夫桶中之水試之，亦得豆漿狀物，惟色稍淡。余曰：「邊入大量井水！尙有何說？「水夫默然</p>
<p>鋼兒體弱，乃訂飲牛奶：每晨送來，封口輙破，余已疑心攙雜矣—遂問送奶者曰：「封口因何常破？」彼應曰：「長路顚簸，安得不破！」余乃取碘酒出，滴入牛奶中，但見碘質過處，盡呈藍色。余曰：「攙有豆漿！」送奶者羞憤曰：「先生亦知豆漿之價並不賤耶？」科學揭穿食品攙雜，可爲確證。</p>
<p>余妻患貧血，遵醫所　，服有機酸　補血劑。一日，傾少許於杯中，銦兒誤將茶汁在入，驚喜若狂而啡曰：「媽媽將喝墨水矣！」是鐵鹽遇茶中的單寗酸，生成黑色之單寗酸鐵。醫士每囑病家服鐵劑後，不可飲茶，於此獲得明證。</p>
<p>課罷歸來，余妻輙備茗相待。余妻謂余曰：一聞子專攻通俗科學，對茲茶葉的浮沉，亦有說否？」余凝思良久，方將啓答、余妻戯謔曰：「子何默默，大類女郞？」余曰：「物之浮沉，基於比重：某物較同容積之液體重量爲大時則沈，小時則浮，等重時則隨處可停，此物理學上所明白宣示者。茶葉浸水後，比重增加，因即下沈；葉上漸生氣泡，體積增大，即比重减小，隨又上升；及至液面，氣泡爆裂，比重增加，又復下沈。謂予不信，請細察之。」余妻笑曰：「奉茶而得科學新知，是誠有趣！」</p>
<p>日月易逝，轉瞬十年，往事如烟，情想髣髴。於是作記，以留永念。時在三十七年暮春三月，地在上海市立新陸師範科學館中。</p>
<h3>在高壓之下</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>雖說我們也能運用超級的工具，升上高空，深入數十哩的海洋遨遊，但却始終不曾越出同溫層，或　入地心去，祇是在一個物理環境相仿的範圍裏，讓生命之花，在那裏怒放着。</p>
<p>在這個範圍裏，不論是壓力，溫度或其他的物理環境，從宇宙的觀點來看，是幾乎相同的。正有許多物質在我們所未曾到達的地方，遭遇着不同的「境遇」。</p>
<p>因此，我們如果要澈底明白物質的一切和這世界的建築，就非去明白那處於多種環境中的物質的一切現象和原理不可，更從此發生了許多知識和應用的科學；也靠了這些知識，人類創迭了他們的更生動的生命世界。</p>
<p>許多物理環境中，有一個是研究科學者所熟悉，而普通一般人大都不感到和他有什麼關係的，那便是「壓力」。</p>
<p>最近四十年米，由於實際上的趨向，我們已化了不少的精力，來明瞭這對一切物質極有影響的壓力問題。</p>
<p>科學家們很早就已普遍地用一個壓力的基數，來衡量極高壓力。那便是大氣壓」。通常的意義就是每平方吋的面積上負有十四，七磅的壓力，那力量是由空氣重力而來。</p>
<p>因此，在深海底裏底，壓力自然不同，很明顯，除了他有大氣的負荷以外，還載着長長的水柱；一個六哩深海的底面上所受的壓力，計算起來，就要相當於每平方吋上有一千個大氣壓的壓力。</p>
<p>還有一種高壓力，可以發生在定容積容器中氣體膨脹時，在大砲裏，炸藥化氣膨脹所發生壓力常在二三千大氣壓力之上</p>
<p>在我們所居住的地球的中心，誰都知道是高溫的岩漿，也祇知道火山的噴發是一種偉觀，不明白那就是高壓力的表現。在被寗靜的表皮所包圍着的地心裏，存在着三百五十萬個大氣壓的壓力環境。</p>
<p>像這樣高的壓力，人類是無法控制的。在今日實騐室裏所能得到的壓力，也就祇他的十分之一强；相當於約每平方吋四十萬個大氣壓的壓力。實在是一個「小巫見大巫」的數目。</p>
<p>然而差不多地球三分之一的物質所受的壓力，都是在這個壓力範圍以內，所以已相當地够我們作為物質在高壓下的狀况的應用，不能算怎樣少了。</p>
<p>事實上，不要說像我們實驗室裏很難以得到和研究的四十萬個大氣的高壓，就在僅是十萬個大氣壓力的環境裏（約合每平方吋上有四五〇噸的壓力），已能發現許多重要和令人驚異的事實了。</p>
<p>也許你要奇怪，又怎樣獲得這　大的壓力呢！科學家們是用了簡單的原理，精密的機械和巧妙的方法；來達到他們的目的。最初，運用水壓機的原理，靠流體傳輸來獲得高壓的方法，所有的困難，就在漏泄（Leak）的不能避免。因爲在一個不能封閉緊密的器械裏，高壓是無從發生的，但不久就有了解決的方法。</p>
<p>時製的流體容器用了優良的隔漏（Packing）物質，使漏泄减至極少；而由於極高壓力的造成，更自動使流體漏泄减少，這便是高壓下流體的自動封固性（Self—tightening　the　packing）。壓力愈高，相對的漏泄愈不易。</p>
<p>在這時候，影響高壓力的獲得不再是漏泄問題，而是由容器的材料强度（Streugth）來決定了。</p>
<p>雖然我們有了能耐高壓的比鋼料更强的合金，如碳鎢合金等，在被壓迫的情形下，强度要在鋼的二倍以上。但對於如此龐大壓力的要求，還是不够。</p>
<p>科學家們在材料需要不够的時候，於是又設計了另一個方法，便是用互相調和的「套箱法」。這和製造大砲筒用數個鋼管套成，同一原理。他們在一個高厭容器之外加一層比較低的高厭容器套。這樣就可以獲得壓力漸降而使壓力差比較小的作用。而材料的强度也就不必有忍受最高壓的强度了。（未完）</p>

<h3>何不食肉糜</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>老老實實地說：政治上如果不澈底澄淸，澈底革除官僚主義，則任何枝枝節節的辦法而希望能肅淸賞汚，講行政效率，知非欺人，便是自欺。</p>
<p>裁汰冗員在原則上無可非議，可是員一裁，便算澄淸吏治，則是連說這話的人都會自知其妄的罷。</p>
<p>有人說：裁汰了「冗員」，正是鞭策這一批人去就官吏以外的業，倘是正視現實的人聞之就會失笑。從前有過一個問饑民何不食肉糜的皇帝，只不渦說明了這皇帝之和民間隔離太遠，不若天高地厚。今天而有這稱論調的人，</p>
<p>莫非也不知道今天幹公務員的人大概在半饑餓狀態中，倘有辦法早已離去了麼？——豈眞「飽漢不知俄人饑」乎？</p>
<p>除了做官，大約祗有工商兩途。工業非盡人可爲，况在不景氣狀態中，若夫從商，遑論不是買賣人不能做生意，縱然可做，我們不是正患做生意的人太多嗎？市儈滔滔者天下皆是，難道眞要北中國爲「中華商國」不成？</p>
<p>官腔人人會打，但對於正在窮中愁悶的人打官腔，便不但是調侃而且近於落井下石了罷？</p>
<h3>福爾摩斯的前身</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>柯南道爾筆下的神探福爾摩斯並非純粹是凌空虛構的烏有先生，道爾受了他的敎授約瑟夫·拜爾博士的感悟才創造出他的不朽的「天才偵探」。也可以說，福爾摩斯就是拜爾博士的畫像。</p>
<p>拜爾博士是一位卓著的外科醫生，在愛丁堡大學執敎。柯南道爾，名小說家史蒂文孫及傑姆士·巴蕾都是他的學生。福爾摩斯的推論及分析的規律都不過是拜爾實際生活經騐的反映。拜爾說：大多數的人祗看而不觀察。向一個人一看，你就發現他的國籍寫在他的臉上，他的職業寫在他的手上，他的其餘的履歷寫在他走路的姿態，習氣，錶鍊的裝飾品和黏附在他的衣服上的纖維上。</p>
<p>有一次，拜爾正在上課，走來了一個病人。拜爾對學生猜測說來者是蘇格蘭高地軍團中的兵士，並且可能是在軍樂隊裏的。他的推論是這樣得來的：來人的高視闊步的步態暗示出他是高地的吹笛者；而他身材矮小，所以，如果他當過兵，他就可能是在樂隊裏的。</p>
<p>但是來人堅特說他自己是一個鞋匠，從未參加行伍。於是拜爾要求他將襯衫脫掉，結果在他的皮膚上發現一個烙印的小藍字「D」。這是當克里米亞之戰時軍隊中烙在逃兵身上的標識。來人終於承認他曾在高地軍團的樂隊中服渦役。</p>
<p>一天下午，拜爾坐在「皇家醫院」，有人在敲門。「進來」，他說。一個人進來了。拜爾對他注視一番。「你爲甚麽煩惱？」他向來人說。</p>
<p>「你怎麽知道我煩惱？」</p>
<p>「因爲你敲了四下門。沒有煩惱的人敲兩下就心滿意足了，最多也不過三下。」</p>
<p>那個人的確是煩惱。</p>
<p>拜爾每天想對他的學生證實，觀察是一種科學，而不是魔術。在「皇家醫院」，拜爾對一個新來者瞥視一下，然後說逍：「我看他是一個補鞋匠。「後來他對學生們解釋說：「那個人的褲子的膝部的內部都穿破了，這是一補鞋匠的特徵。他們是用那一部份夾住鎚鞋的　砧的。」</p>
<p>不過，拜爾博士並非是百無一失的。有一次，他問一個臥床的病人說：你是一個樂師嗎？」病人回答說：不錯。</p>
<p>「你們瞧，諸位，」拜爾轉身對他的學生們自負的說，「這是很簡單的事。這個人患了頰部肌肉麻痹症，是過度吹奏樂器的結果。我們祇要問一聲便能證實了。」他再轉身問病人道：「你奏的是何種樂器？」</p>

<h3>段祺瑞之碁癖</h3>
<p>— 復盧</p>
<p>段祺瑞服官淸代甚久，入民國後，斷續秉政垂十餘年，亦曾叱咤風雲，佔現代史上煎要之一頁，其爲功爲罪，他日自有定論，惟平日圍碁一枰以外，別無癖嗜，殆爲人所盡知。就余所悉，摭拾一二，亦足以資談助。</p>
<p>當辛亥以前，段方調署江北提督，駐節淸江浦，其子駿良（名宏業）亦隨官同往，嗜圍碁有父風，評其技，略在二三手之間。深居署內，苦乏人對壘，詢知浦地有天寳樓茶社，碁客　集，自辰至酉，落子丁丁然不絕於耳，因往啜茗，藉作局外觀，惟浙人聞曼卿差善，餘子大率平平。閱之不覺技養，　聞對局，而博注甚豐，聞因未識，然意頗輕之，迨出手，殊不平凡，始知爲勁敵，局終聞負二子。臨行，駿良堅約明日至其寓一較短長，屆時遣人來邀，比至則赫然提督府也，始各展姓字，安局對奕，各以全力赴之。將半，一老者至，著湖縐棉袍，短髭微蒼，口角略斜，駿良肅然而起，聞亦隨之，老者命仍坐奕，負手作壁上觀，聞亦不敢問，老者退，以詢駿良，曰，此家大人也。自是常過從，互爲對局，段技較其子略遜，有時輒勝乃翁，每爭一子，往往不稍寬假，段慍然見於色，旣敗北，曰：「汝甚事不能做，祗會下下碁而已！」</p>
<p>同時有王研白者，亦浙人，一門均擅書法，世居提督幕中，司製奏本，亦工奕，日侍段手談，甚相得。光復後段任內閣總理，來書招邀，寓於府第，掛名末僚，月領乾俸，每日追陪一二局，別無所事。一日，方對局，有請謁者至，段則召於　次，　不輟，臨辭去，段起爲之介日：「此王先生，余之故人，子有所需，尙非不舞之鶴。」客唯唯，亟趨與王周旋，約明日過其所居，及期而往，乃知爲新任東三省鹽運使，遇段請訓者也。越　偕往，出關視事後，　王以奉天　　局長，任事經年，頗有所獲，愈流勇退，返燕京作寓公矣。</p>
<h3>兒童國</h3>
<p>— 國平</p>
<p>在南斯拉夫國中，離開貝爾葛　城六呱處，有一個兒童共和國。人口五千，他們居住在山坡邊的木房中，他們的年齡是從六歲起至十四歲爲止。他們自己辦理警衛，郵政，和鐵路。</p>
<p>他們的鐵路僅六哩畏，與貝爾葛雷的鐵道相聯接，孩子們對於這小規模的鐵路感到非常滿意</p>
<p>山上一部份的木料巳經伐掉，作爲建造房屋之用。孩子們在自己屋子的四周築了道路，也種植了不少樹木花草。這小小的共和國中每個孩子都有工作做，當他們聽到哨子一響，便迅速地集合在塲上，穿上一律的制服，開始工作。</p>
<p>這些孩童們很有組織地選舉他們的領袖，組成議會，推舉議員。他們自己管理着這小國，祗有極少數的幾位成人來執行敎育，督察，及輔助的工作。</p>
<p>他們有一間美術展覽室，陳列着那此會獲成績優良的獎狀及競賽冠軍的孩子們的照片。他們當然也有着各種的娛樂和消遣品，使他們在精神生活方面也有相當的享受。</p>
<p>這種敎育兒童們對於實際公共生活的實騐，已引起整個南斯拉夫人士的注意，許多南斯拉夫的小學生都曾到這小小的共和國去參觀過。</p>
<p>這羣兒童旣天眞又敏慧，他們快樂地共同生活着，享受到敎育，也得到了從工作中得來的樂趣。</p>
<h3>「彌縫使其淳」</h3>
<p>— 馬彬</p>
<p>偶　扇面：欲請人書，翻　集，選飲酒第二十云：</p>
<p>「羲農去我久，舉世少復眞；汲汲魯中叟，彌縫使其淳。鳳烏雖不至，禮樂暫得新；洙泗輟微響，漂流逮狂秦；詩書復何罪，一朝成灰塵。區區諸老翁，爲事誠殷勤；如何絕世下，六籍無一親。終日馳車走：不見所問津。若復不快飲，空負頭上市；但恨多謬悞，君當恕醉人。」</p>
<p>此詩意境雖不足言，惟不佞酷　其義；淵明當晋　將移之際，棄官退隱，觀其詩文意，多以沮溺自况，飲酒二十中，則此意更明，一終日馳車走，不見所問津」，當係思念孔子而憾不得復見；淵明性恬淡，除近似顏子之儒外，初與孔門各派不合，惟其對儒家之思想體系，認識極深，二千年來，說儒學者多矣，但終未不及淵明「汲汲魯中叟，彌縫使其淳。」二語來得精湛明瞭。「彌縫使其淳」者，亦「中庸」之意也，但比「中庸」二字更能道出儒家精神。且文字組織雅麗，無流俗說道之意味；蓋宋明腐儒，大談中庸，益覺此二字之不可耐，今得陶句，至可喜焉。</p>
<p>「但恨多謬誤，君當恕醉人」二句，束坡曾盛稱之；不佞曾謂淵明之稱醉，其實微醺而已，「君當恕醉人」者，要非醉漢口中所能說，且有無窮隱衷也：戰亂之世，欲求保其首領而沒，初非容易，阮籍佯狂，劉伶躭酒，其實非自甘糟塌身體，而欲自掩本色，不得已也。淵明情形正亦如此，惟做得較爲自然，至後人誤以陶氏爲生性淡泊耳！</p>
<p>淵明固世家子，少時亦曾奔走，當賦感士不遇之際，何嘗不欲爲汲汲魯中之叟？及見「彌縫」大難，退而獨善其身，亦人之常情也。狂捐雖殊途，其實同歸，亂世而獨　其身者，以整個人類言，其功蓋決不會在積極　進華之下。</p>
<p>此時讀陶集，益覺亂世做人之難，以淵明之放達無爲，猶不得不說君當恕醉人，餘子可以想及，但吾輩亦祗能以陶詩寫寫扇面而已！</p>

<p>宋明軒將軍（哲元）於「七七」事變前，以冀察政委會之各義駐平，時敵燄已不可嚮邇，將軍委曲求全，支持年餘，亦大不易。抗戰軍興，其　下趙佟張諸將先後殉國，宋亦轉戰谷地，積勞盡瘁，病歿蜀中，靑山埋骨，大節無虧。而其在「冀察」任內，敵方所施之侮辱壓迫，有非常情所能堪者。如豐台事件，如齊化門事件，皆以倭軍之橫行，强令宋部退讓屈服。尤駭聽聞者，乃以大隊坦克車游行城內，於通　廣塲，作攻防演習，使宋部軍及警察瞠目相對，莫如之何。宋不得巳，且爲招待，請其　田代及諸將領飲宴，且令大刀隊在席舞刀，娛此「嘉賓」，蓋旣無力以拒，又未便默爾，姑「好整以暇」，表示「滿不在乎」之態度，是亦無辦法之辦飛，可謂極「忍耐」之能事，看在時局艱難，總算「忍辱負重」，說到人格方面，則無異於「唾面自乾」了。正所謂「是可忍，孰不可忍！」然亦不自宋始也，在「冀察」政會組織以前，無理侮辱之事，已不止一端，香河之鼓動地痞自治，津市之顧用流氓便衣擾亂，鬼鬼祟祟，而尙侈然自居於文明强國，東亞領導，眞乃厚顏。又記得二十四年天津日租界有個姓白的（老同盟會員，在租界辦報）被人打死了，日酋遽然找到河北當局，大發雷　，大肆要挾。其實，案子旣然發生於日租界，界裏的日軍日警所司何事？不自然其昏　，反向中國當局訛詐，後來擴大交涉硬提六條，把省當局于將軍及平津的中央辦事人部請「開步」，層層進逼，任情欺壓，到了宋哲元之「冀察」，根本就是拼著受氣而上台。然而二十六年的春間，因「明朗化」的要求無已（即照「冀東」僞府完全脱離中央），實在忍不下去，纔躱到原籍樂陵，不久就發生了「蘆變」。即此可見彼敵之「辱」華，無所不　其　。</p>
<p>「七七」以後，平津首先倫陷，果與「冀東」一樣「明朗化」了。爲國際觀瞻及見好市民，忽又做些敷衍面子的事情，外表倒像安靜得多。但地下工作及反日行動的靑年被他們捉去，則又極其辱虎之能事，世人但知押於彼隊者受苦刑灌凉水等等，但據曾經「地獄」者言，「虐」尙可忍，「辱」實飛當。如平大新聞學系第一班吳集徐艿夫婦，係與天鵬友鷥同級之高才生，畢業後，服務　報，卓有聲聞。蘆溝變起時爲津益世報編輯，益世總主筆生寳堂兄殉國後，報亦停版，秋塵夫婦匿居英租界，秘密組織抗日宣傳兩年，早被敵偽列入「黑單」。二十八年夏，日敵封鎖英界，氣燄浸及默人，英方與之東京談判，迫於當時情勢而軟化。敵捕於黑夜會同英　將吳夫婦捉去，秋塵則挨打之外，有時被請坐下談談，一語不合則又隨便踢踢打打，其酋乃嬉笑自如。鑄白內係女子不打，但令作苦役，有甚於打者。總之「士可殺不可辱」，彼則偏要「大辱而特辱」。</p>

<h3>Gu Zhutong Flew to Zhengzhou Yesterday to Command, Land and Air Coordination to Defend Kaifeng, Bandits Attempted Three Incursions into the City but Were All Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, upon the President's order, flew to Zhengzhou by special plane from Nanjing on the morning of the 20th to command the military rescue of Kaifeng. He also convened Sun Zhen, Liu Ruming, and others to give instructions. He returned to Nanjing from Zhengzhou by the same plane at 9 PM that evening. It is also learned that the Hu Lian troops reinforcing Kaifeng had reached the outskirts of Kaifeng City on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to a military news agency's urgent dispatch from Kaifeng at 9 AM on the 20th: The Battle of Kaifeng is now in its final stage. Since the first batch of bandits who broke into the southeastern corner of the city yesterday afternoon was repelled, and more than 1,700 bandits who broke in for the second time were completely annihilated, the remaining five to six thousand bandits who broke in for the third time in the evening engaged in fierce street fighting with the defending troops in the southeastern city gate area. The fierce battle continued until midnight. The security forces in the southern part of the city transferred their positions to the northern part of the city, constructed fortifications, and continued to confront the bandits. More than 700 bandits who had invaded near the Song Gate in the eastern part of the city were annihilated. Another group of bandits broke in and set fires in the city center. This morning, civilian houses near the northwest of the provincial government have been occupied by the bandits. Currently, the air force is heavily bombing the bandits inside and outside the city, and the bandit's momentum has been slightly thwarted. The national army is firmly defending the provincial government and the artillery positions in the northwestern corner of the city, as well as the three major strongholds of Henan University in the northeast, and is fighting a desperate battle with the bandits. Reinforcements have arrived on the outskirts of Kaifeng and are fiercely attacking the bandit's flank.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The Battle of Kaifeng entered its fourth day and night today. With the assistance of the powerful aircraft of the Yellow Sea and East Sea air groups, the defending troops fought bravely and the morale is increasingly high. After midnight on the morning of the 20th, some bandits broke in from the west gate and were bravely resisted by the defending troops south of the provincial government, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The air force also flew low to assist in the battle. By dusk on the 20th, almost all of the bandits had been annihilated, and the breach in the west gate had been blocked. The attacking forces on Kaifeng have been confirmed as the 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns of the Chen bandit and the 1st Column of the Liu bandit, totaling more than 60,000 troops. They have suffered at least 10,000 casualties due to the combined land and air attacks by the national army over the past few days.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The two major air groups, Yellow Sea and East Sea, continued to fly over Kaifeng day and night on the 20th to assist in the annihilation of the stubborn bandits. It is reported that more than 20 tons of bombs have been dropped today, killing at least 3,000 bandits. The flight personnel of the two major air groups witnessed from the air the fierce hand-to-hand combat between the defending troops south of the provincial government and the invading bandits. The high morale was beyond description. The two major air groups maintained a strong presence over Kaifeng today, ensuring that there were aircraft providing cover at all times. The close cooperation between land and air forces has reached the most ideal state.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 20th] Air force aircraft today heavily bombed more than a hundred bandit boats concentrated in the area of Dayaozhai on the south bank of the Yellow River north of Bian, sinking them all.</p>
<h3>Henan Representatives in Beijing, Zhang Honglie and Others, Petitioned the President for Aid to Bian, The President Personally Received Them and Said the National Army Had Thorough Deployment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Amidst the crisis in Kaifeng, five Henan representatives in Beijing to the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and Provincial Assembly, Zhang Honglie, Li Hongyi, Duan Jianmin, Zhao Peiwu, and Wang Rupan, went to the President's residence on Huangpu Road on the morning of the 20th to petition. The President personally received them at 11 AM. Zhang, Li, and others lamented the critical situation in Bian and Zheng, and requested that a large army be dispatched quickly for rescue. Duan, Li, and others cried and pleaded with tears in their eyes. The President replied that the central government had a thorough deployment for the war situation in Henan Province and had sent senior officials to Zhengzhou to command. The central government was determined to use the fastest methods and make the greatest effort to rescue Kaifeng. The President also stated that he would take absolute responsibility for military affairs and hoped that everyone would trust the President and the army, and not be too anxious. President Chiang Kai-shek also said that the main force of the bandits was now in western Shandong, and the national army had a thorough deployment to give them a severe blow. The meeting lasted more than ten minutes. Zhang, Li, and the other five then left. At 4 PM, people from Henan in Beijing learned that the bandits had attacked and entered Kaifeng City at noon on the 20th, and the situation was urgent. They gathered again with Henan National Assembly representatives, Legislative Yuan members, Control Yuan members, provincial assembly members, and more than 300 fellow villagers to discuss countermeasures. They decided to go to the President's residence again to petition. At 6 PM, more than 100 people from Henan in Beijing first went to the Presidential Palace to request an audience, but learned that the President was not in the palace. They then went to the residence on Huangpu Road at 8 PM to request an audience, presenting three requests: (1) Please dispatch a large army quickly day and night to rescue Zheng and Bian. (2) Please have the President personally inspect the front lines to boost morale, or send a senior official to rescue Kaifeng within a limited time and ensure Zhengzhou. (3) Please have the central government punish the military commanders who have mishandled the situation and failed to provide effective rescue. Because the President had already received the Henan representatives in the morning and given a sincere reply, he did not grant an audience. The petitioning representatives insisted on seeing the President. At about 9 PM, Yu Jishi, representing the President, met with them, expressing that the central government had sent a large army to rescue and explaining the central government's emphasis on the war situation in Henan Province, hoping that the representatives would return first. At about 10 PM, Xue Yue, the Chief of the Military Affairs Department, had a sincere talk with the petitioning representatives, repeatedly explaining the central government's intention to emphasize the Henan situation. The people from Henan still refused to leave and refused to eat or drink anything, insisting on a hunger strike to the end. At about 11 PM, Qin Decun, the Vice Minister, reported to the petitioning representatives that there were seven major strongholds in Kaifeng City that were still in the hands of the national army, and that reinforcements had approached the suburbs, and that it had been decided to send more troops to continue to rescue and send senior officials to Zhengzhou to take charge. The petitioning representatives were still in high spirits and refused to leave. After Xue Yue and Qin Decun repeatedly persuaded them, and guaranteed to meet them at 10 AM the next morning, the petitioning representatives left the President's residence at 1:30 AM this morning.</p>

<h3>Postal Rates to Increase Threefold, Executive Yuan Has Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Deliberation, May Take Effect on July 1st</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] An increase in postal rates is inevitable, marking the end of months of soaring prices. At its regular meeting last week, the Executive Yuan, based on a request from the Ministry of Communications, approved the rate increase, raising the cost of ordinary letters from 5,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan, a threefold increase. The rates for other postal items will be increased proportionally. Because the postal rate increase concerns an increase in the people's burden, the Executive Yuan has submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation in accordance with the law. It is generally expected that if legislative procedures can be completed quickly, it may take effect on July 1st. It is reported that the last rate increase was on April 5th, three months ago. Due to rising prices and repeated increases in employee benefits, revenue cannot cover expenses. Losses in June exceeded one trillion yuan. The Ministry of Communications therefore requested a rate increase and proposed two options: one is to increase the current price by three times, with ordinary letters costing 20,000 yuan; the other is to increase the current price by five times, with ordinary letters costing 30,000 yuan. After consultation, the Executive Yuan decided to increase it by three times and plans to implement it on July 1st.</p>

<h3>U.S. Congress Passes Foreign Aid Bill, Aid to China Amounting to 400 Million Yuan, Including 125 Million Yuan in Military Aid, Sent to President Truman for Signature</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Congress completed action on the $6,030,710,228 foreign aid bill on the morning of the 20th, including 400 million yuan in aid to China. The bill has been sent to President Truman for signature. The aid package for China includes 125 million yuan in military aid.</p>
<p>Shortly after the House passed the compromise bill by a vote of 318 to 62, the Senate passed the bill by a voice vote.</p>
<p>Before the Senate vote, Vandenberg praised the action of the joint committee of the two houses in restoring most of the cuts made by the House as a "fundamental contribution to world peace."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] After breaking a serious deadlock on the evening of the 19th, the joint committee of the Senate and House passed a $6,030,710,228 foreign aid fund, including a $400 million aid fund for China. The joint committee also agreed that the U.S. government should decide whether the $4 billion aid fund for Europe should be allocated in fifteen months or twelve months. The aid fund for China includes $125,000,000 in military aid. The foreign aid fund includes $1,300,000,000 for relief and reconstruction in the four occupied zones of Japan, Korea, Germany, and Austria. After reaching an agreement, the joint committee broke the deadlock that would have prevented Congress from adjourning on the evening of the 19th. This was a victory for the Senate, which had insisted that the European aid plan and other aid plans should receive the amounts recommended by the government. Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman and Secretary of State Marshall were convinced that $4 billion was needed within twelve months and was urgently needed. In addition to the European aid fund, the committee also passed: (1) a $400 million aid fund for China, including $125,000,000 in military aid; (2) $1.3 billion for relief and reconstruction in the four occupied zones of Germany, Japan, Austria, and Korea; (3) $225,000,000 for Greece and Turkey to "isolate communism"; (4) $35,000,000 for the United Nations Children's Relief Fund; (5) $70,710,228 for the International Refugee Organization Fund. The joint committee almost entirely agreed with the amounts advocated by the Senate. The final decision was $503,000,000 less than requested by President Truman.</p>
<h3>Principles of Sino-U.S. Bilateral Agreement Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement on the use of U.S. aid to China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been intensifying its study of the U.S. draft for the past month and actively consulting with the U.S. Embassy. Various principles have been determined with reference to the U.S. "Economic Cooperation Act of 1948" and the actual situation. Once a report is made to the Legislative Yuan and approved, it can be formally signed. This agreement will be signed in the form of an administrative agreement. It will take effect after signing. It is reported that the main points of its content, in addition to stating that the economic and other relations between China and the United States are very close, and that aid is provided to enable China to help itself, seek domestic economic stability, and eliminate the current situation that may endanger the establishment of lasting peace; it also stipulates the measures that China should take to accept this aid, and other matters concerning the supply of materials and other matters. All aid, except for the 60 million U.S. dollar construction loan, will be provided to our country in the form of donations. The important measures that China should take are approximately: (1) Implement a self-help plan to increase agricultural and industrial production to the extent that no additional assistance is needed. To achieve this goal, the United States will provide material assistance for increasing coal, oil, and food production, and for transportation construction. (2) Take fiscal and monetary measures to stabilize the currency, determine exchange rates, and balance the budget to restore monetary credibility. (3) Effectively utilize domestic resources and foreign aid, including all materials, wealth, labor, and the property and income of Chinese people in the United States. (4) Facilitate trade with the United States and, on a reasonable principle, agree with the United States to supply the industrial raw materials it needs and which it itself lacks. In addition, it may be stipulated that when the United States grants aid to China in the form of a donation, China will deposit an equivalent amount of legal tender into a special account. This amount is combined with the unused amount from the sale of relief materials under the previous Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement. It may only be used to stabilize the monetary and fiscal system, increase production, investigate and develop resources, and for legal tender expenses of U.S. representatives, or for other purposes agreed by both parties. As for the repayment of loans, it will be paid for by Chinese products needed by the United States. The transportation of U.S. aid materials to China will mainly utilize U.S. ships. Materials subsidized by charitable relief organizations will be exempt from tariffs. The situation of China's acceptance and use of U.S. aid materials or funds, and the progress of the implementation of the agreement, will be reported to the United States every three months after the agreement is signed. The Chinese government should also provide necessary reports that are helpful to the aid to China plan at any time upon request from the United States. Regarding the termination of aid, in addition to the automatic termination due to the full implementation of the plan, if the U.S. government believes that the terms of the agreement have not been fulfilled, and that the aid has deviated from its original purpose, or that the situation has changed and the aid conflicts with U.S. interests, it will stop all aid plans. The various principles included in this Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement are roughly the same as those concluded between the United States and European countries. The technical issues regarding implementation will be left to the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and U.S. representatives to discuss and decide at any time. As for the opening of ports for ships carrying U.S. aid materials in Jinghan and other places, the agreement does not involve it.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Membership Issue Expected to Be Resolved, Lei Zhen Returned to Nanjing Yesterday to Report, Carrying Written Opinions from the Youth Party</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Lei Zhen, who mediated the dispute between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party over the number of seats in the Legislative Yuan, took a bus back to Nanjing on the evening of the 20th to report. Before leaving, Lei waited at his residence for reports from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on the conclusion of their Central Standing Committee meetings. At 7 PM, he received a phone call from Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party, who stated that the meeting of the Democratic Socialist Party had concluded, and that their opinions on the Legislative Yuan issue were very close to those of the government. The party hoped that the Kuomintang could concede ten seats, so that the basic number of proponents (thirty) could be made up. In the future, if possible, they hoped that the party would still have fifty Legislative Yuan members participating. As for the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, and two Grand Justices and Examination Committee members each, the Democratic Socialist Party will not nominate candidates on its own initiative, but will accept them if the President issues an appointment order. At 9:15 PM, Lei received a phone call from Li Huang of the Youth Party, who stated that the meeting had resulted in a written opinion. Yan immediately went to Zuo Shunsheng's residence to collect it and then took the Beijing-Shanghai bus back to Nanjing. Before leaving, Lei had three phone calls with Zhang Qun, relaying the results of the Democratic Socialist Party and Youth Party meetings. Zhang is expected to stay in Shanghai for one or two more days; Wu Tiecheng returned to Nanjing with Lei on the same bus on the evening of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Lei's Remarks Before Departure</h3>
<p>Before leaving, Lei Zhen told reporters at the station: The Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the Legislative Yuan is generally no longer a problem. When he went to the headquarters of the Youth Party on the 19th, they raised seven opinions, but some points were overemphasized, and he could not convey them to the government on behalf of the government. After explaining each point, he returned them and expressed the hope that the party would reconsider them. The party then convened another Central Standing Committee meeting on the 20th, revising the original seven opinions, and the attitude was more moderate than before. Although the content cannot be fully disclosed, what can be told is that the party has made a "turn" on various issues, so the Legislative Yuan issue may be resolved. As for the party's participation in the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuans, it will be resolved with the resolution of the Legislative Yuan membership issue. As for the party's hope that important political measures in the future must be decided after consultation among the three parties, he believes that it is not difficult to achieve, because if the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participate in the Executive Yuan, then the two parties will have the right to advocate for political affairs. According to reporter inquiries, the seven opinions raised by the Youth Party are not very insistent on the number of Legislative Yuan members, but in order to compensate, they are doing their best to advocate that the government should guarantee that the party will participate in local governments.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lisheng Considers Accepting, Will Serve as Vice President of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Zhang Lisheng is about to formally decide on the matter of serving as the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. The reporter visited Zhang on the 20th to solicit his opinions. He said: "I have only seen this matter in the newspapers, but I can consider accepting it. Not to seek high office, but because I do not want to evade responsibility at this difficult and dangerous time. I will follow the spirit of obeying the leader and obey orders." He also said: "The Vice President of the Executive Yuan is a position with no real power, but I can use it to visit various places, inspect the people's conditions, and communicate between the central government and local governments." When the reporter asked about the current three-party cooperation issue, Zhang said: "The government has always adhered to the spirit of cooperation, hoping that the two parties will participate in the Executive Yuan. Currently, the Youth Party's Legislative Yuan membership issue is still being worked on. However, there may be delays in time, because it cannot be resolved in the short term. As for the Youth Party's participation in the government, discussions are currently underway on the cooperation issue in local governments, and some provincial government committee members may be given to them."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Seriously Addressing Several Realistic Problems of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Sixth Assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council opens at 9:00 AM this morning, and will discuss various practical problems facing Shanghai. Various parties have proposed as many as 45 motions. In this time of great turmoil and widespread hardship, seeking local stability is fundamentally impossible. Especially in this international city teeming with foreigners, the social problems that arise are exceptionally complex and particularly worrying. Today, the lives of Shanghai citizens, be it in clothing, food, housing, or transportation, are all facing serious problems. Taking advantage of the opening of the Sixth Assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council, we specifically raise several important and realistic problems for a comprehensive review, hoping to spark discussion and that the municipal councilors can use their collective wisdom to explore the future of Shanghai.</p>
<p>First, the issue of grain supply is not only related to the stability of people's livelihoods, but also closely related to the security of Shanghai. In the past week, rice prices have been rising daily, exceeding the ten million mark. Given this trend, the surge in rice prices seems endless, making all five million citizens of the city feel threatened by "white terror." As the saying goes, "Food is the paramount necessity of the people." If a proper solution to the grain supply problem cannot be found, not only will people's livelihoods be unstable and security be a concern, but also all other administrative matters will be out of the question. This council is meeting amidst the mad rise in rice prices, and should pay special attention to this increasingly serious food problem for the people. Shanghai is an industrial and commercial metropolis with a dense population, exceeding five million people according to recent statistics. However, Shanghai itself is not a land of fish and rice. Therefore, the grain for all five million citizens of the city must be obtained from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as imported rice from abroad. Logically, rice prices should exceed those in the producing areas. However, based on the highest rice prices last week, rice prices in this city are still lower than those in the producing areas, which must be attributed to the Civil Relief Association's allocation and sale of American rice. However, the source of American rice is ultimately limited. If the municipal government wants to rely entirely on American rice to maintain the people's food supply, it is reliable but not sustainable, and definitely not a long-term solution. Currently, American rice can still flow in, and the allocation and sale of American rice in this city will continue. However, concerns about the people's food problem cannot be ignored by the municipal government, and it should especially plan ahead and take precautions; otherwise, the grain supply problem will eventually become Shanghai's biggest worry. If the rice-grabbing trends in Changzhou and Ningbo spread to Shanghai, not only will security be impossible to maintain, but the entire industrial and commercial economy may also be dragged down. Therefore, we must raise special vigilance!</p>
<p>Second, crack down on speculative merchants and eradicate the artificial factors that cause price increases. Everyone admits that Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the source of price increases. Prices in all parts of the country almost entirely take Shanghai as the standard, especially in cities like Beijing and Hangzhou, where prices follow Shanghai's closely. The factors that cause price increases are certainly numerous, but behind every price increase, there are always artificial factors. These so-called artificial factors are the hoarding and speculation of speculative merchants, as well as engaging in black market transactions. Taking gold and currency as an example, financial authorities have repeatedly ordered the crackdown on gold and currency trading, but the black market for gold and currency still exists, and every price increase is led and promoted by gold and currency. The government has specifically established financial control bureaus in the five cities of Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin, responsible for cracking down on the black market for gold and currency and all other illegal trading. In Shanghai, since Director Li Lixia took office, there have been several concrete actions against black market gold speculation and arbitrage, cracking several major cases. However, "the wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life." Those engaged in speculative arbitrage and the black market for gold and currency remain unchanged. As a result, after Director Li resigned, the new director, Gao Fang, has not yet taken office, and the director's position is still vacant and being sought after. How can the work of managing finance and cracking down on speculation be allowed to stall when it urgently needs to be fully launched and highly developed? Speculation is an inevitable phenomenon in industrial and commercial cities, especially in today's Shanghai. However, if the municipal government does not find ways to crack down and allows a laissez-faire state, the consequences will not only constantly stimulate price increases, but also endanger the industry and commerce itself. Therefore, we cannot help but see the prevalence of speculation in Shanghai as a current concern, and demand that the municipal councilors face this crisis squarely and propose practical and effective measures to crack down on speculation!</p>
<p>Third, Shanghai's prosperity is a superficial prosperity, and cannot conceal its internal dilapidation. Moreover, the phenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer is becoming increasingly clear, and this fact cannot be denied. Therefore, on one side of Shanghai society, we see the wealthy indulging in extravagance, enjoying all the pleasures of urban material civilization; but on the other side of Shanghai society, we see the poor living inhuman lives. This contrast between the two extremes truly evokes the feeling of "behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine are left to rot, while on the road lie the bones of those who have starved to death." Shanghai is a paradise on earth, and at the same time, it is a hell on earth. In recent months, on the one hand, due to the recession in industry and commerce, many factories have been unable to maintain themselves and have had to close down, causing the number of unemployed workers to increase day by day; on the other hand, due to the expansion of war zones, refugees have flocked to Shanghai. The strong become bandits, and the weak become beggars. Although the municipal government has established refugee shelters, it cannot solve this serious problem. Refugees who are scantily clad fill the streets, which is not just a matter of urban appearance, but a serious security problem. Therefore, solving unemployment and providing relief to refugees is truly urgent. The Social Affairs Bureau has already been planning for this problem, but it has not yet been concretized. In any case, chanting "no giving campaigns" at this time is not a solution.</p>
<p>Finally, we must offer one more word to the municipal authorities: Our country's democratic constitutionalism has already stepped onto the right track, and the central political institutions have been reformed, presenting a new look. However, local political systems remain the same and have not changed, which is not compatible with the promotion of democratic constitutionalism in our country. Therefore, the municipal authorities should immediately actively prepare. As soon as the Legislative Yuan passes the provincial and county autonomy regulations, this city should immediately formulate municipal autonomy laws, first implement local autonomy, and elect a mayor, as a model for all provinces and cities in the country!</p>
<h3>Yang Mei Research Committee Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss New Phase of Examination Work</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] The Yang Mei Research Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM this morning at No. 9 Jialing New Village. Committee members such as Hu Xianwen and Yuan Yinguang, who are related to nurses, participated and had a heated discussion on the Yang Mei incident, which will be re-examined starting on the 21st. It was unanimously agreed that Chongqing lacks instruments for metabolic examination and can only conduct preliminary clinical research. However, efforts should be made to ensure accuracy and caution. For example, scales and thermometers must be tested on time every day and measured with multiple scales to avoid errors. In addition, Yang Mei's room also has meteorological equipment to understand whether sunny or cloudy weather has an impact on Yang Mei. In short, the aim is to give foreign and domestic experts two impressions before they come to Chongqing: (1) There is a reliable preliminary record here. In-depth research can continue to explore along this line, avoiding repetitive and time-consuming work. (2) It is a fact that Yang Mei does not eat and does not have bowel movements. In short, there is no need to wait for foreign experts to uncover all the true and false situations.</p>

<p>Hangzhou [This Newspaper Dispatch] Recently, rice shops in the urban area have refused to sell rice, causing grain prices to skyrocket.

<h3>Xi'an Yang Mei, Fasting for Seven Years, Also Preparing for Examination</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Xi'an, 20th] Regarding Ms. Zhang Guiqing, who has been rumored in Chang'an for fasting for seven years, the Xi'an Municipal Citizens' Hospital sent personnel to investigate and has accepted her father's request to have her examined by the hospital soon to see if she is "Yang Mei the Second" or an incomplete refusal to eat due to a morbid condition. The reporter saw this 22-year-old red-clad girl, although she wore powder and rouge and permed her hair, her external secondary sexual characteristics seemed very subtle, and she did not express any reaction to matters of men and women. According to her father, Zhang's first menstruation was at the age of thirteen, but it was immediately interrupted and has continued until now. This seems to be a phenomenon caused by malnutrition affecting sexual function, which is different from Yang Mei in Chongqing. Ms. Zhang started at the age of sixteen, due to a period of shock and fear, she was unwilling to eat food, and if she reluctantly ate, she felt great pain and had to vomit it all out. She currently has poor muscle development, a flat abdomen, almost no bowel movements, and little urination. She usually likes to do needlework, likes to breathe fresh air, and dislikes noisy and bustling environments. All these phenomena are very similar to Yang Mei. Ms. Zhang drinks two cups of boiled water three times a day, in the morning, at noon, and before going to bed. She adds two small spoons of white sugar before going to bed once, and occasionally eats some fruit, but a small pear is enough to eat for three days and is not essential. In addition, she has absolutely no fat, starch, or protein entering her abdomen. How can this meager food support the long-term excess of physical heat? If this interesting question is solved, it will help to reveal or deny the mystery of the Yang Mei type.</p>

<h3>Commemorating Longshan: The National Army Establishes an Eastern Barrier for Greater Jinan; Bandits Fought for Three Days and Four Nights Before Finally Abandoning Guns and Throwing Away Bullets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 16th Dispatch by Air] By chance, I commemorated the Longshan Railway Station and its surrounding areas, 35 kilometers away from Jinan, at noon today, just ten hours after it was still a battlefield. Here, the National Army fought fiercely with the Communist bandits for three days and four nights.

<p>Both Sides' Deployments: The National Army's deployment in this area was one regiment stationed in Longshan and Shancheng Village to the southeast; one regiment in Loujia Sih, north of Longshan; two regiments in Liguanzhuang to the northwest; and one regiment in Wulitang to the southwest, totaling five regiments. The total force used by the Communist bandits this time was the bandit Bohai Column's Yuan Yeli's units, including the New 7th, 11th, and 13th three divisions, as well as the Independent 14th, 15th, and 16th Regiments, totaling twelve regiments. After using five regiments as reserves, the first wave used seven regiments, of which three regiments attacked Loujia Sih, Liguanzhuang, and Wulitang, respectively, to contain the National Army in each area and prevent the National Army in each area from reinforcing Longshan and Xiaocheng Village. The main force of four regiments besieged Longshan and Shancheng Village, less than one li to the southeast. The battle broke out simultaneously at 8:00 PM on the 12th. The bandits' initial attempt was to eliminate the Tan Xinghuang Regiment of the Qian Boying Brigade stationed in Longshan and Shancheng Village. The bandit leader, the commander of the Bohai Column, held a meeting for three days, believing that he could still use his old tactics of "besieging the city and attacking reinforcements" and "using the big to eat the small" to "eat" the Tan Regiment and then change into new equipment. Regiment Commander Tan believed that the Longshan area was vast and the force of one regiment was too weak, so he changed to defending the high ground Shancheng Village in the southeast of Longshan with the main force, while using two companies to provide mobile support outside.</p>
<p>Recapturing Longshan: Due to its weak forces, Longshan fell into the hands of the bandits on the night of the 12th. With the loss of Longshan, the rear connection of Shancheng Village was cut off. The bandits then concentrated their forces to besiege Shancheng Village. Regiment Commander Tan feared that because the troops had only arrived at the station for two days, they could only rely on the most hasty field fortifications to resist. By the morning of the 13th, Brigade Commander Qian Boying, fearing that Regiment Tan would be lost, personally led the other two regiments of his unit from Jinan. After traveling 70 li a day to reach the battlefield, he launched a flanking counter-encirclement against Longshan. After more than 20 hand-to-hand combats, he finally recaptured Longshan Town at 12:00 PM that night. At this time, the bandit siege of Shancheng Village became even fiercer, attempting to occupy Shancheng Village before the Longshan National Army could recover from its fatigue. However, they could not withstand the joint attack from the National Army in the two areas. The bandit's four-regiment force suffered nearly half of its losses and had to retreat northeast of Longshan before dawn on the 15th. At the same time, the bandits attacking Loujia Sih, Wulitang, and other places also retreated one after another after being defeated.</p>
<p>Attacking Yujiazhuang: The bandits first retreated to the Dajiazhuang, Yujiazhuang, Taipingzhuang, Ershilibao, Huangsanyuan area, about six or seven kilometers to ten kilometers northeast of Longshan. Brigade Commander Qian, in the process of expanding the results of the battle and pursuing, also recovered the remnants of the Bandit New 7th Division that had fled to Ganjiazhuang. It was completely recovered at 2:00 AM on the 16th. The National Army in that village alone used as many as a thousand shells. A staff officer told me that at the current market price, an average shell costs 200 million yuan. Brigade Commander Qian personally went to a position 100 meters east of the village to command the battle of attacking Yujiazhuang. The bandit's machine gun killed his orderly who was close to him and wounded his adjutant, but Brigade Commander Qian was unharmed.</p>
<p>New Graves Piled High: When I inspected Longshan, I saw that all the houses were either destroyed by artillery fire or by incendiary bombs, with bullet marks everywhere and corpses everywhere. When the breeze passed, the indescribable strange smell interwoven with the burnt smell of the burned houses and the stench of corpses, even now thinking about it, still makes people nauseous. From Longshan to Shancheng Village, trenches crisscrossed, and there were even more accumulated corpses. New graves piled high were everywhere. Brigade Commander Qian told me that the bandits originally tried their best to drag back the corpses and bury them themselves, but this time because the National Army advanced quickly and the offensive was strong, they did not have time to drag them away. Our original plan was to bury all the bandit corpses today, but later we heard that you were coming, in order to let you understand the intensity of the battle, so we decided to wait until you had seen them before burying them.</p>
<p>Lord Guan Fell: Traveling north from Shancheng Village to Yujiazhuang, of the more than 300 households in the village, few complete buildings remained. The Guandi Temple west of the village was also destroyed by artillery fire. Lord Guan was covered in bullet marks and fell on the side of the broken wall. Inside and outside the village, bullet craters were as dense as honeycombs. Because the battlefield had not yet been cleaned up, bullet casings, shrapnel, military caps, and leggings were everywhere. There were also unexploded shells buried in the mud with one end and exposed outside the soil with the other end, so when we passed by, we were all cautious. The bandit corpses were also left for us to visit and were not completely buried. Flies gathered, and the stench of corpses and the smell of gunpowder were mixed together, creating another unpleasant atmosphere. There was a small Catholic Church in the village. Although the doors, windows, and roof were covered with bullet marks, they were largely intact because of the solid construction. The statue of Saint Maria was still hanging in the chapel, solemn and benevolent, as always, seemingly a symbol of peace after the war. When leaving the village, we saw groups of horses and carts transporting large quantities of newly harvested wheat westward. Someone asked him where he was transporting it to. He said: "This time, the Eighth Route Army almost robbed all of our wheat. If the National Army hadn't chased them quickly, I'm afraid even these would have been robbed by the Eighth Route Army long ago."</p>
<p>Officers and Soldiers United: The entire 73rd Division was completely reorganized from local Shandong teams after being "eaten" in the Laiwu Tusikou battle on February 23rd last year. Due to the lack of combat experience, everyone has always been hesitant to make overly high assessments of its combat power. However, in recent years, due to the practical training of generals such as Cao Zhenduo and Qian Boying, and more importantly, due to the practical implementation of the new work style movement advocated by Wang Yaowu, the most satisfactory results have been achieved in this battle of Longshan. On the way back from the battlefield inspection, a lower-ranking military officer said it well: "Only the battlefield is the most democratic and the most egalitarian place. Regardless of officers and soldiers, as long as they are on the front line, the opportunities for eating, living, using, and even dying are all equally equal. Only when you get to the rear, the lives of officers and soldiers are isolated and become two absolutely disparate classes of people." But the military officer went on to say: "The above is just a thing of the past. Since Commander Wang advocated the new work style movement, the lives of officers and soldiers have been integrated. Everyone goes to the drill ground, goes to the lecture hall, rests together, eats communal meals together, and even goes to the battlefield together. The officers fear the soldiers like parents fear their children. How can a unit in this situation not win battles?"</p>
<p>Due to the victory of the Longshan battle, as Division Commander Cao of the division said, it increased his confidence in the original combat power of the unit by more than two times. At the same time, it also stabilized the mood of the 700,000 citizens of Jinan City, which was surrounded. A strong barrier has been established here on the eastern side of Greater Jinan City.

<h3>Republican National Convention Opens in Philadelphia Today; To Elect Next Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Philadelphia 20th] The world's attention is focused on Philadelphia today. This historic city has been prepared as the venue for the opening of the Republican National Convention tomorrow. The outcome of this convention is likely to determine the U.S. foreign policy for the next four years. After sixteen years of continuous rule by the Democratic Party, according to various indications, the Republican Party is about to rise again and take charge of the national government. The Republican presidential nominee, regardless of who it is, will have a significant impact on the fate of the party and the American people. Considering the importance of the United States in the post-war world, it is also of great significance to the whole world.</p>
<p>Republican politicians from all over the country are gathering at this meeting. They are deeply convinced that the party will win the general election in November, so they are expressing great optimism, which was rarely seen during the Roosevelt administration.</p>
<p>Among the noises before the Republican National Convention, the following developments are noteworthy: (1) New York Governor Dewey still ranks high in this year's Republican presidential candidate competition. Senator Taft and former Minnesota Governor Stassen follow behind, but it is expected that no one will be able to obtain the required 548 votes for nomination in the first vote. (2) Four to ten votes will need to be held at this conference before the presidential nomination can be determined. (3) In addition to the above three, Senate Speaker Vandenberg is also a possible candidate often mentioned. (4) The final decision will be in the hands of Republican power figures, especially the leaders of the so-called major delegations, such as those from Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. (5) In the first and second votes, the above delegations are expected to vote for their delegation leaders, but this is just a gesture of support.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Advocates Enhancing Friendship with China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Philadelphia 20th] It is said that Senator Vandenberg's foreign policy, including aid to China policy, will be the basis of the foreign policy adopted by the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Republican Convention's Proposals Committee. This policy recommends that the Republican Party continue to maintain the current U.S. bipartisan foreign policy, including the following provisions on China policy. These provisions were unanimously approved by the subcommittee, and their content is to cultivate and enhance the policy of American friendship with China. China's integrity and freedom will be of permanent concern to the United States. The subcommittee is led by Senator Lodge, who is generally considered to be a Vandenberg supporter. The Republican Party's entire policy will be submitted to the Congress on the 23rd for formal adoption.</p>

<h3>British Navy Studies: Submarine Stealth Warfare</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 19th] The Admiralty announced that the British Navy will begin exercises to prevent submarine offensives in the English Channel and the waters northwest of Britain starting on Monday.

<h3>West German People Begin: Exchanging New Currency Notes</h3>
<p>Orderly Queueing</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin 20th] Germans in the British, American, and French occupation zones of West Germany began lining up in the rain this morning to exchange old marks for new marks. Each person can exchange 40 old marks for 40 new marks for use during the transition period. After one month, each person can exchange another 20 old marks for 20 new marks. The design of the new mark banknotes is very beautiful. According to a report from the three occupation zones' command, the exchange locations are orderly and no incidents have occurred. According to German newspapers, since the announcement of the West German monetary reform on Friday, nearly 5,000 people have been arrested for attempting to cross the border into the Soviet occupation zone with old mark banknotes, which will lose their value in West Germany but are still valid in East Germany. Smugglers are carrying large sums of old mark banknotes, with one person carrying 50,000 old marks (equivalent to 10,000 pounds).</p>
<h3>Internal Strife Eliminated, Labor Unrest Overcome: French Cabinet's Position Stabilized; One-Hour General Strike Nationwide Without Incident</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 19th] The Schumann Cabinet's position was further consolidated on the 19th after eliminating internal cabinet strife and overcoming the labor unrest crisis. At the same time, according to reliable sources, Schumann has decided not to change his cabinet lineup, including Foreign Minister Bidault. Schumann and the two cabinet members who caused the dispute by criticizing "economic policies that will lead to the government's collapse" met for two and a half hours. The Prime Minister finally reached a compromise agreement with Finance Minister Mayer and Labor Minister Daniel.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 19th] French workers went on a one-hour general strike today to support the striking workers in the rubber industry in Clermont-Ferrand, but no accidents occurred. In Paris, city traffic was once suspended until the strike ended at noon.</p>
<h3>British Organizes Air Passenger Transport Between Berlin and West German Occupation Zone; German Communist Manifesto Resolves to Seek German Reunification</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin 19th] Since the Soviet authorities ordered the blockade of land and water passenger traffic between West Germany and the Soviet occupation zone to prevent new and old marks from flowing into the Soviet zone, it is estimated that more than 5,000 Western Allied and German passengers have been blocked at the British military zone border near Helmstedt. The line of cars is as long as "the eye can see". Soviet officials at the border only allow Soviets and Yugoslavs living in the Soviet zone to enter the Soviet zone from West Germany; all other people are refused entry. Because the Soviet authorities' blockade order does not apply to air and land freight transport, British authorities began organizing air passenger transport between Berlin and West Germany on the 19th. Although freight trains traveling from West Germany to Berlin are not prohibited, Soviet inspectors are conducting strict inspections of goods and personnel on the trains to prevent the smuggling of old marks, which are useless in West Germany but still valid in East Germany. Therefore, all trains are delayed for a long time. A U.S. official in Berlin, referring to the Soviet authorities' blockade of traffic, said that when the monetary reform is implemented in the Soviet zone, the U.S. occupation zone authorities will deal with it in the same way. However, British officials admitted that "until there is evidence to the contrary, this move by the Soviet authorities is a necessary precaution to prevent currency smuggling."</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin 19th] The German People's Council controlled by the Communist Party in the Soviet occupation zone today claimed to be the legitimate representative of the German people and announced that it would promote various measures to lay the foundation for a united German republic and win the people's support in West Germany. Qualified observers agree that this move is the Soviet Union and the German Communist Party's response to the six-nation conference in London's decision to establish a West German government. It is also the German Communist Party's intention, with the Soviet Union as its backer, to organize a government in Berlin and demand national recognition.</p>
<h3>French Occupation Zone in Germany: Closes Swiss Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 19th] The Koblenz radio station in the French military district of Germany reported that French authorities have ordered the temporary closure of the border between the French occupation zone and Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Britain Reaffirms Respect for: United Nations Charter</h3>
<p>Advocates Adopting Collective Security System</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London 19th] British Minister of State McNeil reiterated at the annual meeting of the United Nations Association today that the United Nations Charter remains the basis of British foreign policy. He said that if the United Nations can be a tool for advancing work one day, then the United Nations will continue to be the institution chosen by the British government to advance its policies. McNeil advocated that all countries, including the Soviet Union, have the right to organize regional security alliances with neighboring countries, but they must be strictly defensive in nature.</p>
<h3>Italian Communist Leader Arrives in Rome; Rumored to Meet with Zhdanov; This Trip Expected to Trigger Italian Communist Rectification Movement</h3>
<p>[Reuters Prague 19th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti arrived in Prague on the 17th from Rome, and on the 18th he went to the Romanian capital. The rumor that Togliatti will meet with Zhdanov, the secretary-general of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the founder of the Communist International, has not been confirmed or denied.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome 19th] People at the Italian Communist Party headquarters in Rome remain tight-lipped about the whereabouts of Italian Communist leader Togliatti and Communist Senator Secchia. Observers here believe that Togliatti's trip abroad will trigger a rectification movement along the lines of the U.S. Communist Party, and the name "People's Front" may be abolished, so the left-wing Socialist Party participating in the People's Front may be excluded. People in Rome believe that since the Communist Party encountered setbacks in the Italian general election, European Communist Parties will adopt stricter party rules and will begin launching violent movements in Western Europe to undermine the European recovery program, which is still in the development stage.</p>
<h3>Hungary and Poland Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Budapest 19th] The delegation led by the Hungarian Prime Minister left for home this afternoon after signing the Hungarian-Polish Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance.</p>
<h3>Afro-Asian Conference Opens in Paris</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris 20th] The Afro-Asian Conference convened by the left-wing Socialist Parties of Britain, France, India, Vietnam, and Africa opened this morning in Bito, near Paris. British Independent Labour Party Chairman Edwards addressed the meeting, advocating the organization of a third group of nations in Western Europe, Asia, and Africa as a buffer between the United States and the Soviet Union. He said that if the nations of these regions are driven into either of the opposing camps of the United States and the Soviet Union, freedom will be lost and war will be inevitable. The first step in realizing this great plan will be to unite the socialist parties of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Times have changed, and colonial nations are moving towards complete freedom. European socialist parties should join hands with colonial nations on an equal footing to establish a connection between the great centers of Asian and African nations and European cultural and industrial activities.</p>
<h3>Chilean Communist Party Activities: Military and Police Strictly on Alert</h3>
<p>[Reuters Santiago 19th] After the government revealed that the Chilean Communist Party would launch new unrest, Chilean military authorities have been ordered to be on alert and take necessary measures to deal with it. A government spokesman said that some communists intend to provoke incidents before Congress passes the Democratic Defense Law (including anti-communist measures). The police have checked their list and will arrest them one by one.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Ashida Declares: Will Restrict Left-Wing Activities</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 20th] Prime Minister Ashida told Congress on the 20th that if the recent labor movement in Japan is "excessive," the government will have to take some measures to restrict left-wing activities, because the recent labor unrest may lead to the collapse of the recovery plan. His warning came after the continuous strikes by transport workers and the announcement by a powerful capitalist organization that it would raise 100 million yen to implement a plan to crack down on left-wing elements.</p>
<h3>Philippine Labor Nationalization Bill: Quirino Vetoes It</h3>
<p>Believes It Violates the Spirit of Sino-Philippine Friendship</p>
<p>[United Press Manila 20th] Philippine President Quirino vetoed the Labor Nationalization Bill on the 20th. The bill stipulated that Philippine people must account for at least 60% of the people in various businesses. This bill, passed by the Philippine Congress in its current session, has been fiercely opposed by foreigners, especially overseas Chinese. It is rumored that Quirino vetoed the bill because he believed that it violated the spirit of Sino-Philippine friendship and violated obligations to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>New Indian Governor-General: Sworn in Today; Mountbatten Leaves India for Britain</h3>
<p>[United Press New Delhi 20th] Gopalachari arrived here on the 20th, and will be sworn in as Governor-General of India tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 19th] Outgoing Governor-General of India Mountbatten will return to Britain with his family from Delhi on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Sudan Prepares for Autonomy: Egypt Still Disagrees</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 19th] Sudan Governor-General Howe has issued an order to establish an administrative committee and elect a legislative assembly. This is the first step towards autonomy for this North African land with 7,000 square miles and a population of 7 million. The British government has approved this system as a result of long-term negotiations in Cairo and Khartoum (the capital of Sudan). However, the Egyptian government believes that this system is equivalent to continuing the Anglo-Egyptian condominium system and has not recognized that Sudan should be placed under the rule of the Egyptian king, and has not yet agreed to it.</p>
<h3>Huge Explosion in Cairo Jewish Quarter</h3>
<p>Many Dead and Injured, Cause Unknown</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo 20th] Three buildings were destroyed and fifty people were injured and killed in the Jewish residential area here at 5 a.m. this morning. It is rumored that this was caused by the explosion of a powder magazine secretly stored by Jews.</p>

France has also agreed to supply the medium cruiser "Émile Bertin" to perform the same task during the ceasefire. Belgium, the third country requested by Bernadotte to supply coastal patrol vessels, replied that it was unable to comply. The United States also requested that its destroyers and other ships not use any force or obstruct any ships they encounter, in order to avoid accusations from Israel that the United States is interfering in Jewish immigration matters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 19th] The former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, stated that he still insisted on establishing a unified Arab Palestine. At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, also stated that the Arab League leaders had decided to reject any plan to establish a Jewish state.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 19th] Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett addressed the Jewish Party Congress today, detailing the overall situation, saying that our attitude has made it clear to the United Nations mediator that the State of Israel and its sovereignty are inviolable. He also stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to assist the State of Israel, but this does not mean that we must join the world conflict. We must resist Britain's attempts against Israel and hope that another British government can understand our principles.</p>
<h3>Talking About the European Situation</h3>
<p>— Ben Geng</p>
<p>Will War Break Out? (1)</p>
<p>The Second World War has been over for more than two years in fact, but not only are the main peace treaties—with Japan and Germany—still elusive, but the whole world, especially the European continent, seems to be brewing for another war. In less than a year, the European continent has gone from the proposal of the Marshall Plan and the refusal of Eastern European countries to participate, through the establishment of the Cominform, the organization of the Greek anti-government army, the breakdown of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' London Conference, the signing of the Five-Power Treaty, the Czech coup and the suicide of Jan Masaryk, the Soviet protest against the United States' military advisors in Iran, the proposal to revise the peace treaty with Italy, and the recent traffic problems in the British and American occupied areas of Berlin. The occurrence of each problem, while one side indicates a reversal of the situation, the other side more or less deepens the tension in Europe. The opposing situation has more or less been established.</p>
<p>On one side is the Eastern European group centered on the Soviet Union, including about ten countries; on the other side are the sixteen Western European countries centered on the Marshall Plan from the Five-Power Treaty. Although some countries remain, they do not seem to be able to play a role in easing the situation, and even these countries may not be able to survive for long outside the two major camps. Some people compare today's situation to the eve of the two world wars in 1914 and 1938, but one thing is very different from 1914 and 1938, that is, on the eve of the wars in 1914 and 1938, the United States was somewhat aloof. Now, although the geographical distance is still the same as before, politically the United States has not only participated in the disputes in Europe, but is also one of the most important protagonists.</p>
<p>The current situation is that there are indeed many problems that have arisen but have not been resolved, and problems that are about to occur and may occur at any time seem to be everywhere. Therefore, some people are discussing or wondering whether war is about to break out again?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>I don't think we need to answer this question directly, but just analyze the possibility of war.</p>
<p>Those who believe that war is about to break out have roughly the following reasons: Although the current international situation is complex, if we simplify it, the entire situation is the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union. This opposition represents two different social systems and ideologies, and war is unavoidable. Since it is unavoidable, it can naturally break out at any time. A detailed analysis shows that there are several factors that may cause war to break out soon. First, both sides, whether based on "self-defense" or other reasons, are clearly taking various means to defend against each other. This kind of tit-for-tat, although the chess players are only laying out the board, the tighter it becomes. If any move of the chess is seen by you as self-defense or you estimate that the other party can tolerate it, but in fact the other party believes that it exceeds self-defense or believes that it cannot be tolerated, war may follow. It now seems to have reached the point where it is getting tighter and tighter. Second, the United States may confidently believe that its economic power is sufficient to immediately support a large-scale war, and it is now the only country that openly possesses the atomic bomb. Thus, if it believes that war is inevitable, it may hope to fight before the other side's strength is abundant. Assuming that some people in the United States really have this idea (of course, this assumption seems very possible to some people), then war will naturally not be too far away. Third, on the Soviet side, there are two opposing situations that may cause it to create war. One is that the Soviet Union may also already have the atomic bomb (it was once rumored that the Soviet Union tested the atomic bomb in Siberia last summer), or perhaps although it does not have the atomic bomb, it believes that the atomic bomb is not enough to determine the outcome of the war, or perhaps it underestimates the amount of atomic bombs currently possessed by the United States. On the European continent, the Soviet Union may confidently believe that it is "invincible." In this situation, it may make the Soviet Union feel that since war is inevitable, it is better to strike first rather than wait for the revival of Western European countries. The other is that the Soviet Union may overestimate the power of the United States, causing it to involuntarily expand its "sphere of survival" without limit. This unlimited expansion of the "sphere of survival," whether subjectively for "security" or not, will objectively force the early arrival of war. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Current Crisis of National Goods Factories; Appealing to the Central Government to Resolutely Save Them</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Federation, in order to seek solutions to the actual difficulties of national goods factories, recently telegraphed relevant departments of the central government, appealing to the facts and putting forward four requests, earnestly requesting a swift rescue to avoid collapse. The four requests are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Open up production loans so that general national goods factories can obtain periodic low-interest loans, reduce the exploitation of usury, and reduce costs. At the same time, please restore industrial and mining loans to engage in production and construction in order to gradually seek price stability. (2) Open up the exchange settlement policy. At a time when exports are sharply reduced and imports are excessively surpassed, in order to save this crisis, foreign exchange should be opened up through proper channels to encourage exports, especially special imported products, such as iridium (tariff number 240) for making fountain pen tips and celluloid (tariff number 664B), the main raw material for making pen holders. The Import Control Committee should open up foreign exchange from time to time to facilitate domestic factories to manufacture and resist the dumping of foreign goods. (3) Relax the rationing of raw materials. The quantity of cotton yarn raw materials allocated by the Textile Control Committee each period for simple weaving factories and cotton textile copying industries is not very large, and they have to seek them from the black market, increasing costs and hindering production. Please relax the rationing as much as possible to avoid shortages. For other materials such as dyes and caustic soda bleaching powder required for indanthrene, diesel oil for the glass industry, by-products used by food factories, and raw materials required by the rubber industry, the quantity is insufficient due to limited quotas. Please relax them specially to supply production. (4) Reduce or stop electricity. Factories located in Zhabei, Nanshi, Hongkou, and the old eight districts of this city often have power outages every week. In the event of other accidents, power must be cut off at any time, and the salaries of factory workers are calculated on a daily basis, resulting in invisible losses and seriously affecting production. Please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to specifically restrict power plants from arbitrarily cutting off power and relieve the power shortage to maintain industrial production and avoid increasing costs.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Holds Joint Sea-Land Transportation Between Beijing and Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Service Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company urgently needs to promote service work. Recently, service departments have been established in the Hankou, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Hong Kong branch offices to handle passenger transportation and passenger services. The Guangzhou branch office is also being organized. In addition, the sea-land combined transportation matters previously discussed by the department with the two railway bureaus have now been scheduled to begin on July 1. Passengers traveling from Nanjing to Tianjin will have all their boat tickets issued by the Nanjing Station of the two railway bureaus. Passengers can hand over their luggage to the Nanjing Station and pick it up in Tianjin. It is convenient and safe. Passengers traveling from Tianjin to Shanghai and Beijing will have all train tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai Line sold by the Tianjin China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, this combined transportation is temporarily limited to first class. If it is handled successfully and satisfactorily in the future, second and third classes will be added to make it popular among the public. As for combined sea-air transportation, the department is also negotiating with China National Aviation Corporation.</p>
<h3>Mayor and Others Discuss and Decide to Continue Selling Rice This Week</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu convened Ren Xianxuan, chairman of the Civil Affairs Committee, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others yesterday morning to discuss and decide that in order to increase the supply of food rice in the market and stabilize rice prices, the sale and supply of food rice will continue this week in the North and South Markets. The quantity will still be set at 6,000 shi every other day, and the price will remain at 9.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Call for Exemption from Business Tax on Buying and Selling on Behalf of Customers</h3>
<p>The Rice Merchants Bureau Guild of this city believes that the authorities will levy a business tax on buying and selling on behalf of customers, forcibly banishing food merchants who buy and sell on behalf of customers to the ranks of brokers, and exploiting the legitimate qualifications of the original food merchants. Since the food business tax has already been exempted, it is inappropriate to suddenly levy a disguised business tax on buying and selling on behalf of customers. Yesterday, it specially presented reasons to the authorities requesting approval for exemption. Also, the Shanghai representatives Qu Zhenhua, Xing Zhigang, Zhang Chao, etc. of the National Food Industry Federation's delegation to Beijing to petition, returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is heard that Hou Tingdu, Duan Jianmin of the Tianliang Committee of the Legislative Yuan, Guan Jiwang, Minister of Food, and others separately received them this time requesting exemption from food tax, and the result was quite satisfactory.</p>

<h3>Two Ships Loaded with Coal Stored in Qinhuangdao Can Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Since the recent destruction of the railway transportation between the coal mining area and Qinhuangdao due to war, the transportation of coal produced in Kaiping to Shanghai is facing a serious problem again. According to the Fuel Management Department, the extent of the damage this time is more serious than before, and it may be difficult to repair it in a short period of time. The association is currently working with the Ministry of Communications to establish other methods of coal transportation to avoid concerns about the source of fuel coal. As for the 15,000 tons of coal stored in Qinhuangdao, it has been fully loaded by the "New China" and "Tianping" ships and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to enrich the coal balls required by public teachers and industrial workers in this city next month, the association has purchased another batch of 6,000 tons of white coal from Hongji, Vietnam, which will arrive tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Trial Voyage on the Qiantang River Successful; Jiangnan Ship Returns to Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>[Reported from Hangzhou on the 20th] The Jiangnan ship, which successfully completed its trial voyage on the Qiantang River, is scheduled to return to Shanghai at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow. Today, Deputy Director Wang of the Tanggong Bureau and Zhou Nian of the China Trust Bureau entertained reporters on the ship and sailed to Sibao to demonstrate the ship's performance.

<h3>Customs Employees Issue the Truth about the Work Slowdown</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The work slowdown incident of all customs employees has not yet been resolved. In order to clarify the truth about the work slowdown, the employee representatives of the office issued a statement yesterday, saying: "The treatment of customs is far worse than that of the four banks, two bureaus, and the post office. In order to strive for a thorough improvement in treatment, a welfare association was organized. The treatment was improved with reference to the methods of the four banks and two bureaus, and the proposal has been put forward for a long time. Former Minister Yu and the Chief Inspector of Customs also promised in person that they would strive for it with the minister as soon as the government reorganization was completed. Recently, prices have soared, and the lives of colleagues have been on the verge of desperation. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, all colleagues signed and submitted a request to the authorities to borrow a month's salary for relief. The authorities did not respond. Because of the pressure of life, the welfare association representatives again requested to see the Chief Inspector of Customs on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, requesting three points on behalf of all colleagues: (1) The welfare association organized to improve treatment should be legal. (2) Request that the treatment of customs be changed with reference to the methods of the four banks and two bureaus. Before the improvement, officials should be paid 2.6 shi of rice allowance, and workers should be paid 1.6 shi. (3) Borrow one month's salary for relief. The authorities did not give a satisfactory answer to these three requests. The welfare representatives were forced to resign collectively, and the negotiations reached a deadlock. On the afternoon of the same day, customs work came to a standstill. On the 19th, because the authorities still did not give a concrete reply, this situation continued for another day. On the 20th, it was reported that the Jianghai Customs had partially resumed work at 4:00 p.m. This statement solemnly declares that this news is inaccurate. All of our employees have decided to persist to the end unless a satisfactory answer is obtained to the three requests. The responsibility for the losses caused by this incident rests entirely with the customs authorities. The employees are forced by life, and in order to thoroughly improve treatment to avoid recurrence, we believe that we can obtain the understanding and sympathy of all parties. In addition, The China Press and The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury distorted the facts and slandered the pure request of the customs colleagues to improve treatment. In addition to briefly expressing their ulterior motives, it is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Law Society Holds Annual Meeting and Passes a Proposal to Recommend the Implementation of a Crime Prevention Policy</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Law Society of the Republic of China held its third annual meeting at the Youth Middle School on Linsen Middle Road yesterday morning. More than 60 members attended, including He Shizhen, Cha Liangjian, Huang Liang, Sheng Zhenwei, Guo Wei, Shan Yuhua, Xu Tuhao, Liu Junling, Tang Shichang, and Ji Hao. Wu Xianglin, director of the general assembly, and Zhang Zhiben, executive director of the general assembly, attended the meeting to provide guidance. After the opening was announced, He Shizhen was publicly elected as chairman. After performing the ceremony, Wu Xianglin first delivered a speech, saying that Director Ju Zheng was unable to attend due to business, so he specially wrote a speech and sent him to read it. The content was roughly: "The third annual meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Society is being held at the beginning of the implementation of constitutional government. The consistent purpose of the Society is to elucidate the essence of world law and guide the modern spirit of the rule of law. We hope that the Society will devote itself to three tasks in the future: (1) Imparting basic knowledge of law, (2) Exploring the content of current laws, (3) Establishing a system of Chinese law." Zhang Zhiben then delivered a speech, saying: "Suppressing the rebellion is not only a military issue, but also a rule of law issue. If China can embark on the path of the rule of law, the issue of the Communist bandits who violate the law and discipline can be eradicated. Therefore, in this period of suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution, our responsibility is extremely important."</p>
<h3>Three Proposals Passed</h3>
<p>Then, three proposals were discussed: (1) Judicial administration should still be under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan to emphasize the constitution and clarify the judicial system. (2) Various special criminal laws should be carefully considered and incorporated into the criminal law and the army, navy, and air force criminal law to facilitate the people's compliance. (3) Please suggest that the judicial authorities thoroughly implement the crime prevention policy and enrich the content of prisons. The Society will appoint members to visit prisons in various places nearby, submit reports, and provide reference for the judicial authorities. All three of the above proposals were passed and submitted to the general assembly to suggest that the government adopt and implement them.</p>
<p>Then, the issue of membership fees was discussed. Each member will first collect a membership fee of 200,000 yuan and a printing fee of 100,000 yuan for the member manual. As for the proposal put forward by the members to collect membership fees based on two yuan and according to the cost of living index, it will be sent to the current board of directors for research and implementation.

The supervisors are Guo YunGuan, Liang Jianbo and other nine people. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Funds from North China from Coming to Shanghai; Three National Bank Members to Fly to Beiping and Tianjin Today; To Discuss Improvement of Exchange Restrictions with Local Relevant Agencies</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun, president of the Central Bank, specially sent Xia Jinxiong, director of the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, Li Lixia, director of the Inspection Office, and Wang Zhong, director of the Northeast District Office, to Beiping and Tianjin to properly handle the situation locally in order to stabilize prices and prevent a large amount of funds from North China from coming to Shanghai. The three were originally scheduled to fly north the day before yesterday, but the trip was postponed because the preparation of various related issues was not completed. It is now learned that Xia, Li, and Wang have decided to fly to Beiping and Tianjin by plane this morning to handle everything. According to the person in charge of the National Bank, after the three arrive in North China, they will consult with the military, political, and financial agencies in Beiping and Tianjin to improve the exchange restriction measures to reduce the smuggling of cash to Shanghai. Since the implementation of exchange restrictions, funds from Beiping and Tianjin have been using sea routes to smuggle cash south, and the amount is considerable, so it is necessary to improve them to prevent the northern funds from becoming depleted. At the same time, the National Bank and related parties have begun to transport a large amount of materials to North China for sale and issue treasury bonds in Beiping and Tianjin to absorb funds locally.</p>
<h3>The Cigarette Industry Responds One After Another; Recognizing a Special Donation of 200 Billion</h3>
<p>Since the start of soliciting special donations for relief, all sectors of industry and commerce in this city have responded one after another, and the results have been very good. It is now learned that the cigarette industry has also recognized a donation of 200 billion yuan. The distribution method for each factory is based on the amount of foreign exchange earned from the third phase of tobacco leaves. China Tobacco Company is 10 billion yuan, and Fuxin, Nanyang, Dadongnan, Huaming and other cigarette factories have each recognized a donation of tens of billions or hundreds of billions. All the directors, shareholders, managers, factory directors and employees of each department of this donation will be allocated.</p>
<h3>Huge Losses in Oil Distribution to Public Teachers; China Plant Appeals to the Government for Relief</h3>
<p>The board of directors of China Vegetable Oil Factory held a monthly meeting at the Jinmen Hotel at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. After a long discussion on the matter of contracting the distribution of edible oil to public teachers in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, it was resolved that the accumulated losses incurred by the factory in contracting the distribution of oil to public teachers up to May amounted to 150 billion yuan. If calculated in kind, the loss is even greater, and it is unable to pad it further. It was decided that the factory's management department should submit a report to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Beijing and Shanghai Municipal Governments, reporting the difficult situation and formulating remedial measures. If the government has no concrete measures, starting from July (that is, the distribution of oil to public teachers in June), it will not be able to continue to contract the distribution of oil to public teachers in the Beijing and Shanghai areas.</p>

<h3>Fire in JiangSu Road Shantytown: Child Dies, Two Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A sudden fire broke out in the shantytown at the end of Yangjia Lane on the Dongzhuanbang of JiangSu Road around 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Black smoke billowed into the sky, and flames soared.  Although all the workers of the nearby Taili Machinery Factory used their own water hoses to connect to water and try to put out the fire, they were unable to do so due to the ferocity of the fire.  In an instant, more than ten shacks were completely burned down.  Twelve small handicraft factories in adjacent wooden houses, including TongYi Gong, QiTong, Zhang Pingan, and Li DaDuo cloth and machine factories, were also affected and destroyed.  Fire departments from the JingAn Temple and HuaShan districts rushed to the scene with several fire trucks after hearing the news.  The fire was brought under control after about an hour.  A firefighter from the HuaShan district, Zhu Xiufen (28 years old), fell from an upper floor, injuring her head and legs.  She was later sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Shi Weiwu, a worker from the ChangKun Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 4 Xinglongfang, bravely helped with the rescue but was also burned on his face and hands.  It is reported that the fire was caused by the wife of a shantytown resident, Liu Shiying, who went out to buy rationed rice after cooking lunch, without fully extinguishing the fire. Sparks flew into the shack and immediately ignited it.  A three-month-old baby sleeping in the bed was burned to death.  At the time, one person was caught looting during the fire and was arrested and sent to the police station for punishment.  According to a post-incident investigation, there were 24 households and 9 families with fields and 23 households and 3 families with businesses affected.  Police officers from the police station escorted all victims to the JingAn Temple Police Station for questioning. Liu Shiying, the one responsible for the fire, was also arrested and the case was submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Workers' Comfort Payment Method: Soldiers Association to Request Reconsideration</h3>
<p>Regarding the method for workers to pay this year's comfort payments for new recruits, the Social Affairs Bureau previously convened a meeting and decided that draftees of eligible age should pay comfort payments in the amount of five "dou" of the lowest grade of rice, and workers without conscripted family members should pay the originally set amount of 200,000 yuan. After this method was promulgated and implemented in various districts, the Soldiers Association recently received reports from various districts stating that the above method was inappropriate. In industrial areas with a large number of workers, the comfort payments collected were less than the prescribed quota. Therefore, the Soldiers Association will send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting a re-examination and will announce its implementation within days.</p>
<h3>Bund Park: Plotting Mischief, Gang of Robbers Caught</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the 17th of this month, around 5:00 PM, the Hongkou Camp Branch received a tip that a gang of robbers was hiding in the Bund Park, plotting mischief and attempting to rob the property of the fruit store at No. 161 Huashan Road. They immediately ordered officers to disguise themselves and go undercover, arresting the gang of robbers Jin Abao, Zhou Pixun, Xi Pinshan, Shen Bin, Wang Kunlang, Shi Zhong, Shi Jinxiang, and Shi Xushi, a total of eight people. They were taken to the station for interrogation. Later, a revolver and several bullets were found near the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office in Pudong, Fengxian, and Nanhui counties. The suspects confessed to three crimes: (1) On May 29th, they robbed the home of Yin Daoyu at No. 8 Baijie 3rd Lane, DaNanmen in the South City; (2) On June 1st, they robbed the Ziyang Tea Shop at No. 340 Fuxing East Road; (3) On June 6th, they robbed Guo Luxiao and Ye Chen Jinsu at No. 20 Tianfuli, Wujin Road.

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Adds Hong Kong-Taipei-Shanghai Flights</h3>

<h3>Texaco Employees Disagree over Kerosene Rationing</h3>
<p>Employees of the American-owned Texaco Kerosene Company previously protested the company's cancellation of the monthly ration of three "zong" of kerosene per employee starting in April. After negotiations by the labor union, the company only agreed to issue one can, which caused outrage among the employees. The union reported the matter to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. Now the company has agreed to issue one can for April, two cans for May, and three cans for June. However, the price will be calculated at the market price of 2.88 million yuan per can and must be paid in full at once yesterday, for a total of three cans. The remaining three cans will be temporarily withheld. Compared to the labor union's request that the kerosene price be calculated at the rationed price of 820,000 yuan on April 5th, 1.14 million yuan on May 5th, and 1.64 million yuan on June 5th, the standards of both sides are far apart. Employees believe that they have already made extreme concessions to the company on the quantity, but now the company is deliberately making things difficult by raising the old price. Employees have refused to accept the company's price adjustment, and emotions are extremely agitated.</p>

<h3>Part of the Vehicles in Central District to be Diverted to Suzhou Creek Road</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the one-way traffic control measures in the central district, the section of Beijing East Road from Henan Middle Road to Zhejiang Road has been particularly congested. It is reported that the main reason is the proliferation of vegetable stalls on the south side of Ningbo Road and the fact that the road to the north has not yet been built, leaving vehicles with no place to disperse. The Municipal Public Works Bureau is now planning to divert some of the traffic to Suzhou Creek Road to alleviate the congestion on Beijing East Road.

<h3>Shanghai Yang Sister's Whereabouts Unknown: Two Doctors Move Her Out of Huang's Residence, Three Days of Observation Suggests Intermittent Anorexia</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The mystery of "Shanghai Yang Sister" Zhang Dailin's fasting has finally been revealed under the joint examination of two doctors, Hua Shujun and Li Lin. According to three days of on-site observation, Dr. Li believes that Ms. Zhang seems to have intermittent anorexia. She eats a little fruit every three days, which may be a pathological condition, fundamentally different from the complete fasting of the Chongqing Yang Sister. In addition to the currently unknown motivation based on her life experience, the main reason is likely to be due to the particular weakness of her digestive system. This condition has been discovered multiple times in the Soviet Union before the war, but it is rare in our country. Doctors Hua and Li have collected Ms. Zhang's oral saliva, uterine secretions, and feces, and are culturing them to see what kind of bacteria they contain, in order to confirm whether the aforementioned theory is correct. At the same time, on the 20th, Ms. Zhang expressed her unwillingness to eat bananas again, but peeled and mashed two apples, soaked them in hot boiled water, and ate them. This shows that Ms. Zhang's eating once every three days does not seem to be absolutely regular. It is heard that in order to thoroughly explore the mystery of Ms. Zhang's fasting through scientific methods and with nurses accompanying her day and night, Doctors Hua and Li moved her out of the Huang Linshu residence yesterday, but her destination has been kept secret. As for the future disposition of Ms. Zhang, the relevant parties have not expressed great enthusiasm. According to Huang Linshu, he does not intend to continue supporting her in the future.</p>

<h3>American Ship Carrying Aid Materials Arrives: Shipping Industry Hopes Unloading Will Still Be Done in Shanghai, Hope US Cancels Proposal to Sail into Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is rumored that our government will grant special permission to American ships carrying aid materials to sail into the Yangtze River to the ports of Nanjing and Hankou. The shipping industry in this city is paying close attention to this matter. Yesterday, according to Secretary-General Li Yunliang of the Transport Vessel Industry, the shipping industry earnestly hopes that the United States will cancel this proposal and unload the aid materials in Shanghai, handing them over to our country's ships for transshipment. State-run and private shipping companies have long decided to give priority to the transportation of American aid materials from coastal ports to the interior in order to cooperate with the use of American aid, ensuring speed and convenience. The cost can also be specially discounted. Judging from the current freight situation on the coast and the Yangtze River, ships sailing from Shanghai on various routes have very little freight. In particular, the cargo volume on ships sailing upstream from the Yangtze River to Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou is less than 30%. The amount of American aid materials for transshipment is estimated to be no more than 50,000 tons, and even if a portion of it is transported into the Yangtze River, the freight tonnage is already oversupplied. There is no difficulty in transshipment at all. Moreover, various obstacles placed in the Yangtze River waterway during the war have not yet been removed, and the navigation marks are incomplete. Even inland river ships with a draft of less than 15 feet have great difficulty navigating and often encounter unexpected events such as grounding and collision, while the loading and unloading in inland ports is extremely slow, with an efficiency of only one-third of that of Shanghai. Foreign ships have a draft of more than 20 feet. If they sail into the Yangtze River, the difficulty in navigation, the delay in loading and unloading, and the huge cost of piloting are not cost-effective. The US may use the high transshipment cost in Shanghai as a reason, but in fact, due to the soaring black market exchange rate, the transshipment cost is not much when converted into foreign exchange, while the Shanghai dockworkers can greatly benefit from it. At a time when more and more refugees from various places are coming to Shanghai and the government is struggling to find ways to provide relief, the United States' aid to our country should try to take into account such social issues related to people's livelihood. Therefore, from the perspectives of shipping, economy, and society, it is advisable to unload American aid materials in Shanghai. Li finally emphasized the shipping industry's determination to continuously maintain inland navigation rights and oppose the opening of inland river ports such as Beijing-Hankou, pointing out that other countries, such as the United Kingdom, are still extremely concerned about shipping privileges in China. Therefore, if the government has to grant temporary permission for American ships to enter the Yangtze River due to aid materials, it should be limited to American ships transporting aid materials. It should not be regarded as opening up inland river ports, and other countries without aid materials coming should not use this as an example. This is what our government must insist on, and the people of the whole country should be vigilant together.</p>
<h3>General Price Levels: With Money Supply Overly Loose Last Week, The Rising Trend is in Full Swing</h3>
<p>This round of major price increases began at the end of the first week of this month. At that time, the U.S. reduced foreign aid, and our country's portion was reduced by 63 million yuan, with the utilization period extended to 15 months. When the news came, it stimulated a uniform rise in prices. This rising trend, after the previous week, extended to last weekend, and it seems to be still in full swing.</p>
<p>Last week, the wholesale price index compiled by this publication rose by 27.58%. Among the category indexes, food, textiles, chemicals, and building materials all rose by more than 20%, and fuels rose by more than 30%. The authorities' countermeasures to this round of price increases, in addition to still adopting the old method of tightening the money supply, have not seen any new measures. In fact, in recent months, the money supply has always been in a state of relaxation. Coupled with the continuous southward flow of funds from North China, there has long been a trend of flooding, which various stopgap measures cannot cope with.</p>
<p>Judging from the present, if the government cannot immediately start to stop inflation, not only will the high tide of price increases not be curbed, but it will also sit idly by as the crisis accelerates.</p>
<p>Last week, the money supply was still extremely loose and abundant. The exchange situation of the national banks, except for occasional settlements due to the sale of materials, the amount of deficiency was less than one trillion, while the fixed deposits of national banks with other banks were almost always above two trillion, fluctuating within 30% annual interest.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current inflation, this is the most fundamental cause of the price increases, and it is also the most intractable disease that the government cannot cope with. From the recent financial situation, one is the budget figures that this publication has already discussed in the previous issue, which estimates that the expenditure for the second half of this year will reach approximately 3.6 million trillion yuan. The other is the report of Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu to the Finance and Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the 16th of this month, which stated: "As of now, the amount of legal tender issued is 1.35 million trillion yuan, the revenue for May was 15 trillion yuan, and the expenditure was 75 trillion yuan."</p>
<p>After seeing this financial situation, we will naturally understand why prices are rising, why all measures are ultimately ineffective, and why huge expenditures and massive issuance, price increases, and further increases in expenditures have an inseparable cyclical relationship. Therefore, if the authorities' countermeasures to future prices cannot open up new avenues and find solutions from the root, but are still circling in the current situation, then there will never be a miracle.</p>
<p>The only way the government stabilized rising prices last week can be said to still be selling materials, but sellers sell and prices rise, with little effect. It is said that the authorities are also very distressed and intend to review the reasons.</p>
<p>We can point out: (1) The prices at which the government sells materials completely follow the market price and do not have a stable price of their own. For example, on Friday, the price of 20-count yarn distributed by the Yarn and Fabric Control Committee was close to 400 million yuan, 42-count yarn was mostly above 600 million yuan, and 12-pound Shuangdeng fine cloth was 12.7 million yuan. The distribution price of Taiwan Sugar also increased with the adjustment of the Taiwan exchange rate. The combined exchange rate on Monday was 445 yuan, on Tuesday 463 yuan, on Thursday 477 yuan, on Friday 506 yuan, and on the weekend 521 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Because the government has limited control of materials, the sales policy is hesitant. For example, the Food Regulation Committee's sales of rice sometimes sell and sometimes stop. The control of the food market sometimes forces price-limited sales and sometimes restores the free market. This approach fully demonstrates the government's embarrassment and at the same time gives speculators a great opportunity to show their skills.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of financial facilities, the Gold Control Bureau has approved the use of bills on the same day and will immediately start a trial operation, stipulating: "(1) Banks and companies should carefully investigate the credit of customers who request the use of deposited bills on the same day. If they believe that it can be used, they should order them to find a real guarantor and sign a 'Bill of Use Guarantee' before they can be allowed to use it.</p>
<p>(2) Banks and companies should copy and report the names, account numbers, addresses, and guarantor names of customers who have signed a contract for use to the Gold Control Bureau for record. If the bank or company believes that the customer's credit is not good or there is instability, it may report to the Gold Control Bureau at any time to stop its use, but once reported, it may not apply to restore its use for the customer.</p>
<p>(3) For customers who abuse blank checks, if three returned checks occur continuously, in addition to reporting to the guild by the bank or company as usual to notify the industry to stop dealing with the account, it should also truthfully report to the Gold Control Bureau and, depending on the circumstances, may report to the court for prosecution and file a public prosecution in accordance with the law. The respective dealing banks and companies shall be responsible for providing evidence." From this point of view, the Gold Control Bureau should just formulate management measures at that time to prevent abuses. Why prohibit the use of bills on the same day, resulting in many storms in the market?</p>
<p>Last week, market prices soared, and the newspapers mostly used the word "soaring" to describe the situation. In terms of the stock market, due to the high prices of external goods, many new prices were created. Yongsha closed at a high price of 4,270 yuan on Friday. In terms of yarn and cloth, 42-count Blue Phoenix broke the 600 million mark on Friday, 21-count Double Horse broke the 400 million mark, and Longtou fine cloth stood at a high price of 12.95 million yuan, all setting new records. Due to various reasons such as rising production prices, scarce arrivals, and the transition between harvests, food prices continued to rise last week. The authorities announced on Tuesday that the food market would resume price limits, stipulating that the door-to-door price of white japonica rice would be 10 million yuan, and the Food Regulation Committee would sell 6,000 piculs of rice every two days. However, as a result, there was no high-quality rice on the market, and the market also had less trading. It was heard that the shouting price outside the upper white japonica market on the weekend had exceeded 12 million yuan.</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes also rose sharply. At the weekend, Guben soap was close to 20 million, Meili matches rose to 7.4 million, and 500 large British cigarettes rose to 3.5 million. Other items such as chemicals and building materials also repeatedly set new prices.</p>
<p>The wholesale price index by usage last week is as follows:</p>
<p>The wholesale price index by degree of processing last week is as follows:</p>
<p>The wholesale price index by country of production and sales last week is as follows:</p>
<h3>Currency and Finance</h3>
<p>(1) Money Market Interest Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the money market in this city presented a situation of struggle between the flooding of floating funds and tightening. Almost every day of the week, it was rumored that the authorities would sell a large amount of materials to tighten the money supply, or that national banks would have a huge deficiency. This seemed to be a war of nerves, and in a short period of time, this nerve tactic also had some effect. However, over time, the truth of the matter was revealed, and the situation suddenly changed. The morning high and evening low of the market's underground interest rate last week was a corresponding reflection. Because whether it is within or outside the industry, if it is rumored that the money supply will tighten, it will inevitably collect some funds for urgent needs. But if it is later known that the previous thinking was not very correct, then the supply of funds on the market will inevitably be strong, and the underground interest rate will also decrease.</p>
<p>Last week, from Monday to Wednesday, the underground interest rate before noon generally reached 30% annual interest, but in the afternoon, partly because floating funds from other places were transported in one after another, and partly because the authorities were unable to tighten the money supply, it eventually fell back to 27%. As for Thursday and Friday, the underground interest rate generally stood at 27%, and the strength of the floating funds can be imagined.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, from Monday to Friday, the amount of deficiency in national banks cannot be considered small. Including interbank deposits, the deficiency for five days totaled 429 billion, an increase of more than 120 billion compared to the previous week. Even if interbank fixed deposits of 206 billion are deducted, the actual deficiency of the banks was still more than 220 billion, an increase of almost 200 billion compared to the previous week. However, as we all know, inflation is rampant everywhere, and banknotes are being issued more and more everywhere, whether on the front lines or in the rear. As for selling materials to tighten the money supply, it is mainly concentrated in this city. Naturally, when floating funds from North China, Northeast China, and even the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang arrived in this city last week, how could the limited materials in this city compete? The continued relaxation of the money supply was not unexpected.</p>
<p>As for the fact that after a few days, due to the flooding of floating funds, rampant bidding, high prices, and eager demand, the money supply will temporarily turn to tightness, although it is also an inevitable phenomenon, this cannot be simply regarded as a simple cycle that repeats itself. In fact, it proves that each time the money supply is loose, not only is there a quantitative difference from the previous time, but also in terms of nature, it is more serious than the previous time, and the interval between the loosening and tightening of the money supply also has a tendency to shorten. The seriousness of malignant inflation also lies in this point.</p>
<p>The more severe the inflation, the more urgent the escape of funds. The increase in the amount of deficiency in foreign banks is just one end of the outflow of funds. Last week, from Monday to Friday, foreign banks had a deficiency of 154.99 billion, an increase of more than double compared to the previous week. It is said that most of it was income from selling foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In terms of commercial banks, although everything has repeatedly risen and the search for orders is also eager, the interbank lending has still not been seen to be popular due to the abundant reserves of the banks. Last week, banks after No. 60, the exchange result. A total of 379.95 billion was deficient, an increase of more than 158 billion compared to the previous week. However, due to the abundance of cash chips, the number of banks redeeming cash to offset the deficiency from Monday to Friday was also more than 200 billion. The industry's financial resources are not strained due to the increase in indirect exchanges, also because of this reason.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Last week, the benchmark rate of foreign exchange market prices did not move, and the price of foreign exchange settlement certificates rose fiercely. The price on Monday was only 545,000, but it had risen to about 1.1 million by Friday, a double increase in five days. The Hong Kong exchange rate also repeatedly saw sharp contractions. From Monday to Wednesday, it was 31%, on Thursday it contracted to 28%, and on Friday it saw further contraction. The price of Hong Kong gold was 328 Hong Kong dollars per tael on Monday, and also contracted to 325 yuan on Thursday. The market price of the Hong Kong dollar was 5.48 yuan on Monday, and also contracted by about 4% on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai domestic exchange market, the Guangzhou exchange rate, except for a decrease of 10 yuan to 140 yuan on Thursday, was 150 yuan for the other few days. The Wenzhou exchange rate was 100 yuan at the end of the previous week, raised to 120 yuan on Monday last week, and then raised to 150 yuan on Friday. The intensification of the southward flow of funds can also be seen. The Chongqing exchange rate was flat on Monday and Tuesday, and changed to a discount of 40 yuan from Wednesday, which can be measured that there are also many funds flowing into this city from the Chongqing area. The Hankou exchange rate was 40 yuan on Monday, doubled on Tuesday, reduced to 50 yuan on Wednesday, but then increased again and reached 70 yuan on Friday.</p>
<p>Previously, there was the fact that funds from this city were first remitted to Hankou and then to South China. This time, it is also inevitable. The Tianjin discount rate was the highest on Wednesday and Thursday, each being 150 yuan and 120 yuan, and was also above 100 yuan for the other few days. The northward flow of funds remains the same.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, floating funds from other places continued to arrive in Shanghai, the money supply was still loose, and the prices of external goods were rising one after another. Although the Chinese stock short sellers frequently exerted pressure, they still did not see any effect. Yongsha suddenly soared in the last quarter of an hour, creating a new high price of 3,915 yuan. Other stocks rose uniformly.</p>
<p>When it entered the market on Tuesday, it initially showed a beautiful color. Yongsha once exceeded the 4,000 mark, and small stocks such as Xinguang Jingfu all advanced to high peaks. Suddenly, it was heard that the U.S. House Appropriations Committee had restored the loan case to China to 46 million U.S. dollars, and the buying sentiment turned weak. Yongsha then fell below 3,900 yuan. Other stocks also mostly declined from their peaks.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the situation changed greatly at the beginning of the opening. Because after continuous gains for ten days, people were worried about being high and wanted to be safe, and they took profits one after another. The selling sentiment gradually increased. Yongsha once fell below the 3,700 mark at the lowest point, but then once again knocked on the 3,800 mark because the money supply was still loose. All stocks fell uniformly.</p>
<p>On Thursday, because external conditions were still soaring, people were encouraged, and the buying sentiment was strong again. Yongsha appeared at a new high price of 4,070 yuan. The amount of transactions was also extremely large.</p>
<p>On Friday, floating funds continued to pour in in large quantities, and the prices of Pu Gao Teng Sheng, Yongsha made 4,270 yuan, and eleven types of stocks such as Meiya Xinhuo rose to the limit.</p>
<p>Because it was approaching the weekend and the authorities were saying that they would suppress the rising trend, most stocks saw a small callback, and Yongsha closed at 4,110 yuan.</p>
<p>In the foreign stock market, this week continued the rising trend of last week, and Qiao Xu continued to soar. At the beginning of the week, the money supply was loose, the Hong Kong exchange rate reported a contraction, and external conditions were flying. Yisha rose to 6.3 million yuan, British Union came out of the 7 million mark, and Jardine Matheson created a new high price of 15 million yuan, flourishing like fire and completely new. It was still strong on Tuesday, and rose uniformly. Yisha made 6.55 million yuan, British Union reached 7.5 million, and Yeguang rose from 1.7 million to 1.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate reported a flat price, and suddenly it was heard that the authorities' control was tightening, and the bulls came out one after another. The market situation was uniformly tired, and Pasha fell to 6.2 million yuan, British Union fell by 400,000 yuan, Jardine Matheson trended down by 700,000 yuan, and Yeguang fell by 200,000 yuan. On Thursday, the black market soared, and the prices of external goods all rose. The money supply was loose again, and foreign stocks also reappeared at high prices. Yisha rose to 6.73 million yuan. British Union made 7.58 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson knocked on the 17 million mark.</p>
<p>On Friday, due to the chaotic black market and the skyrocketing prices of other goods, the buying sentiment was extremely strong for a while, and Jardine Matheson knocked on the 18 million mark. British Union was 8.3 million yuan. Yisha rose to 7.6 million yuan. On the weekend, due to the soaring prices of gold and banknotes in the underground market, various stocks continued to rise, such as Yisha closing at 7.7 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Dynamics: The Shadow of the Japanese Goods Threat</h3>
<p>The restoration of Japan and the rampant flow of Japanese goods have undoubtedly constituted a fatal threat to China's national industry and commerce. The impact has also made other countries in the East feel uneasy. According to the United Press International Manila telegram, the Manila Times wrote sarcastically: "Although Prince Konoe is dead, his spirit still lives in the U.S. Department of State, and his dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is still loudly sounding south of the White House."</p>
<p>The Manila Chronicle called on China, India, Burma, Siam, and the East Indies to contact the Philippines and unanimously refuse to trade with Japan. However, on the Chinese side, the attitude of the official or semi-official is not clear. According to the Central News Agency Tokyo telegram, Sino-Japanese private trade has finally started. Since the end of last month, Chinese merchants in Tokyo have begun to negotiate with Japanese merchants, and the transactions discussed have reached about 20. At the same time, the China Trust Bureau, regardless of the opposition of the wool textile industry in the Second District, continued to auction Japanese wool fabrics. Up to the previous week, it had reached three times before and after. Although the wool textile industry repeatedly asked the bureau to stop selling Japanese goods, it has not been effective.</p>
<p>In addition to adopting the proper trade route, the intrusion of Japanese goods also utilizes various smuggling methods. According to the East China News Agency, Japanese goods have been used to smuggle into China by ships carrying compensation materials. As for the targets of the rampant flow of Japanese goods, in addition to mainland China and the South Seas, Hong Kong is a good location. Although the "dumping" of Japanese goods in Hong Kong has aroused fierce opposition and protests from Chinese business groups in Hong Kong, according to the United Press International Hong Kong telegram on the 13th, the Hong Kong side does not intend to restrict trade with Japan, the reason is that Hong Kong's industry is not competitive enough in the free market. It is reported that there are currently about 50 kinds of goods imported from Japan to Hong Kong, mainly raw silk, rayon, piece goods, knitted fabrics, and wool yarn, wool fabrics, porcelain, etc. In the first five months of this year, Japanese goods arriving in Hong Kong reached as high as 35 million Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>In order to promote the export of textiles and obtain foreign exchange, the Textile Export Committee recently drafted a yarn and cloth export plan for this year. The planned export volume of yarn and cloth accounts for 20% of the national output, equivalent to 300,000 pieces of cotton yarn, and plans to sell 40,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 8 million pieces of cotton cloth. It is estimated that it can be sold for 75.875 million U.S. dollars. The target of sales is mainly the South Sea Islands and the Near East Africa, and a part is also promoted in India and South America.</p>
<p>Whether such a plan can be smoothly implemented is quite doubtful. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently cabled the Yarn and Fabric Control Committee and the Textile Export Committee, explaining that in the Philippines, the market for our textiles has repeatedly shrunk due to the large influx of Japanese textiles in recent years. It is said that the main reasons are that the quality of our goods is not as good as Japanese and American goods, and the price is higher than Japanese goods, and the length is not standardized. The size of American cloth is half a yard longer than the original length for each piece, and Japanese goods can also be sufficient, while the size of domestic cloth often lacks half a foot or one foot, so it is not easy to be popular and cannot compete with American and Japanese cloth. Even most of the overseas Chinese businessmen who operate textiles in the area also operate American and Japanese textiles. As mentioned above, the prospect of whether our textiles can be smoothly exported is quite bleak.</p>
<p>The above is just one aspect of the initial impact of Japan's restoration on China's national industry and commerce! As for the impact of other military and political aspects, it may be more serious than this!</p>

<h3>National Movement at Daxia University: Teachers and Students Unanimously Support, Students Petition in Beijing, Final Exam Postponed for Three Days</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] More than 2,000 students at the private Daxia University in this city have established a National Promotion Committee to request that the school be changed to a national university. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted a reporter to report that the goal of this movement is pure, and its meaning is purely to rescue the crisis of dropping out of school. It is said that most of the 2,770 students at the school come from rural areas, and their family situation is not very good. Under the current situation, calculating tuition fees at 4 dan [measurement] of rice per semester, at least one-third of the students will drop out of school. Daxia University has brewed "change to national" movement several times in the past, but without results. It is now heard that the Ministry of Education intends to change it to a national university, so the students intend to take the opportunity to make every effort to promote it in order to rescue the crisis of dropping out of school for more than 2,000 students in the school. This movement has now received unanimous support from all teachers and students, and the students have immediately dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education. The final exam for this semester was originally scheduled to start today (the 21st), but now because the students are devoted to the National Promotion Movement, the school affairs meeting has decided to postpone it for three days, and the final exam will start on the 24th.</p>
<p>The school held its graduation ceremony for this year yesterday morning. Sun Ke, Chairman of the Board of Directors, originally intended to attend the Binjiang lecture, but because he was busy with work in the Legislative Yuan, he was unable to come to Shanghai, so Principal Ou Yuanhuai presided over it. At that time, more than 1,000 students surrounded the auditorium and put forward the "request to change to national".</p>
<p>The school told reporters that the school authorities do not oppose this movement by the students, but approve of it, and are willing to assist in achieving this goal. Principal Ou Yuanhuai also guaranteed in writing that the students' national movement is a reasonable movement, and the school authorities will never punish or expel any students, and will absolutely guarantee the students' personal safety and academic safety, but advised the students to proceed with the request in a reasonable and legal manner, act cautiously, and control their emotions with reason, so as to avoid any unexpected events. The students have also asked Principal Ou, as a current member of the Legislative Yuan, to appeal to the Legislative Yuan for their opinions on the National Movement.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Team to Face Strong Opponent Tonight: Battle Against Encas at the Municipal Gymnasium Starting at 8:00 PM</h3>
<p>Our basketball team representing the World Games, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, has successively fought two matches, defeating Dongxing and Renyu. Tonight at 8:00 PM, they will face the challenge of Encas, a strong Western expatriate team in the city (originally scheduled for 7:30 PM, but changed to 8:00 PM because Encas also needs to attend the Western Youth Softball game), in the third friendly match at the Municipal Gymnasium. Referees will be Zhu Zifang and Chen Baolin. Due to the World Games team's financial difficulties for going abroad, ticket prices have been moderately increased to 20, 40, and 800,000 for reserved seats. Reserved seat tickets will be pre-sold starting at 10:00 AM, and the rest will be sold starting at 4:00 PM. The gymnasium doors will open at 7:00 PM. The maintenance of order at the court will be entrusted to the Siwei Boy Scouts and the police.</p>
<p>In the first match against Dongxing, the World Games team's performance was not very good, barely winning by a small margin of 57 to 42. In the second match against Renyu the night before, they had already returned to normal. Bao Songyuan, Huang Daxie, and others all had excellent performances, and Li Shiqiao's ball steals were particularly remarkable, leaving the fans in attendance in awe. As a result, the World Games team defeated Renyu by a large margin of 70 to 34. Tonight, in the match against Encas, the World Games team, carrying the momentum of two wins in two battles, should not find it difficult to win.</p>
<p>Encas is the strongest team among the Western expatriate basketball teams in the city. In the past, they were formidable opponents. Their strength should not be underestimated. Under the guidance of Kaiji Milov, their coordination is usually tacit. Players such as V Kairoski and Bowei are all brave and good at fighting, and the Black Carbon Que Libotuo is particularly resourceful. However, because the season has passed and they have neglected practice, it will not be easy for them to win against our World Games team, which is a solid and sharp force.</p>

<h3>Science Lives, Superstition Dies</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>The stone figures of officials at the racecourse in this city have been worshipped by ignorant men and women day and night, with incense flourishing. Passersby would stop to watch, eventually causing traffic congestion and affecting the city's appearance. The municipal government solemnly convened a meeting and ordered the removal of the decorations and signs. Those with knowledge praised it. However, some superstitious people, claiming to be Buddhist disciples, filed a lawsuit in court, accusing the authorities of obstructing the people's freedom of religion. Others, wealthy and generous men and women, advocated purchasing land to build a temple for worship. In recent weeks, this absurd matter, which should not have been a problem, has appeared in the local news, becoming a topic of discussion for people after dinner. The absurdity of the matter is unmatched. We, from a scientific perspective, witnessing this phenomenon, cannot help but sigh. To correct the misconceptions, we write to refute it.</p>
<p>Today, science is advancing rapidly, changing with each passing day. Since the end of the war, we have entered the atomic age. World powers are diligently engaged in the exploration of advanced scientific research, hoping to make inventions to restore national strength after the war, improve people's lives, contribute to academics, and benefit humanity. However, the general public in our country does not know what scientific research is, nor are they aware of the era they live in. Their knowledge is poor, and their minds are rigid. They are going backward, regressing to fetishism and animism. What could be more ridiculous? We believe that the poverty and weakness of the country are temporary phenomena that can be changed. However, the ignorance and lack of knowledge of the majority of the people are the most worrying. In today's increasingly fierce global competition, a country must have something to stand on. The strength of a nation depends on academics. While the powers are developing science, striving for excellence, we are drawing lots and consulting oracles, believing in divine power, living in a daze, unknowing. The difference in standards is like heaven and earth. To compete in the modern scientific world with such ignorant people, few will escape natural selection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shanghai is a major port in our country. It opened its doors early and has been in constant contact with Western civilization for over a century. Shanghai has always been at the forefront of applying new scientific inventions and enjoying modern life. Moreover, due to the former concessions, Chinese and foreigners lived together, and they were deeply influenced by European and American culture. Yet, it is unbelievable that today, Shanghai citizens are still displaying the strange phenomenon of worshipping stone figures by the roadside. Some say it is laughable, but we say it is painful. This is because our country's science is backward, and education has not yet become widespread, causing the general public, even though they live in Shanghai, a city of five million people with deep Westernization, to only know about material enjoyment and extravagant lifestyles, not understanding the contributions of science. By extension, people who only know about worshipping gods and ghosts and lack scientific common sense are not qualified to live in modern Shanghai. For example, electricity is widely used, but if one does not have sufficient electrical knowledge, it is fortunate if one can use electricity without causing a disaster.</p>
<p>Science and superstition are incompatible. In countries where superstition is prevalent, science will not flourish. Conversely, in countries where science is advanced, superstition will not be tolerated. The deeper the superstition, the more closed the people's minds. The clearer the science, the faster the progress. For thousands of years, our country has lacked science. People do not seek thorough understanding in their actions, developing a habit of relying on hearsay. As a result, rumors spread, and hundreds of superstitions emerged. The worship of stone figures at the racecourse is just one example. The consequences of such practices are endless. We believe that all scientific workers, in addition to striving to develop our country's scientific cause, should also engage in the elimination of superstition at all times and in all places. In the process of scientific development, superstition is a great obstacle, deeply rooted, and unbreakable. If this obstacle is not removed, science will not be able to develop freely, and the modernization of the country cannot be quickly realized. Therefore, imparting scientific knowledge and explaining scientific principles to the general public is an essential task, so that those who were previously superstitious will suddenly realize the truth. Once the people's minds are opened, the atmosphere will change naturally, and superstition will disappear on its own. It is hoped that those responsible for education at all levels, especially those whose mission is to train the public, will pay more attention to the elimination of superstition, which is also an indirect way to promote the development of science. Then, in the near future, our country's scientific cause will flourish, benefit the country and the people, and superstitious events will be permanently eradicated in China. The British scholar Thomas Henry Huxley said, "Science lives, superstition dies." We wish to recite it for the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Fun Facts About Atomic Nuclei</h3>
<p>— Wang Deqian</p>
<p>Density of the Atomic Nucleus</p>
<p>Usually, when comparing the physical properties of different compounds or elements, we almost always start by mentioning the density and specific gravity of each compound. For example, let's compare water and sulfuric acid. First, we say that the density of water is one gram per cubic centimeter (i.e., per cc), while the density of sulfuric acid is 1.8 times heavier than water, i.e., one cubic centimeter of sulfuric acid weighs 1.8 grams. Then, we compare their color, taste, oh...</p>
<p>But these comparisons are simply not applicable when it comes to atomic nuclei, because the density of the atomic nucleus of each element is the same, even if there are slight differences, the number is very small. However, one thing to declare here is that the density of an element is absolutely different from the density of the atomic nucleus. The density of the atomic nucleus is almost equal to 14/10^15 grams per cubic centimeter, or written as 1,000,000,000,000,000 grams. This number may not seem like much in today's circle society, but it is already quite considerable in the field of chemistry, because no element or compound has a density that can compare to it. Moreover, if you are willing to calculate it further, it will surprise you even more. If you could get 1 cc of nuclear matter (Stuff Nuclei), it would weigh 100,000,000 tons, a number that is much larger than the total amount of steel produced in the United States in a year!</p>
<p>Flame of the Atomic Nucleus</p>
<p>Some people will definitely find this term novel, because we only know about ordinary fire and flame, but why is there also an atomic nucleus flame? In fact, it is not strange. The so-called atomic nucleus flame is a pronoun for the energy and radiation produced at the moment when an atomic nucleus splits. But why not use other words and insist on using "flame"? There are also considerable reasons for this, because when you want to light an ordinary flame, you must have a supply of fluorine in the atmosphere. Similarly, you also need the help of "neutrons" in the atmosphere to ignite an atomic nucleus flame. When you want to keep the flame going, you must have a large amount of coal. In the atomic nucleus flame, it is the same. When you want to keep the atomic nucleus splitting and constantly producing a chain reaction (Chain Reaction), you must have a "just right size" or "critical size" for uranium-235. Other similarities include the fact that ordinary fire can produce visible light and heat, and atomic nucleus flames also produce radiation, but the power of this radiation is much greater than the light and heat of fire. Because of the above similarities, the term atomic nucleus flame came into being.</p>
<p>However, a term cannot fully represent the essence of a fact or substance. Atomic nucleus flames also have differences from ordinary flames. The most important one is the reason why we now call it the atomic age. Ordinary flames require a large amount of fuel, but the energy released is not much, but the fuel required for an atomic nucleus flame is only a small amount, and the energy released is quite large. The end of this war also used this new type of flame. Furthermore, the ash left over from burning coal is just waste, but "atomic ash" contains countless radioactive isotopes (Rodroisotopes), which are treasures in medicine.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that atomic flames are only the driving force of industry, and that atomic ash is research material for medicine, and should not be used for other purposes!</p>
<h3>New Scientific Weapons</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Body Armor</p>
<p>American army ordnance experts are nearing completion of a flexible body armor that will provide walking soldiers with adequate protection, and the death and injury rate will certainly be reduced.</p>
<p>Modern infantry is highly mobile. It is already inappropriate to ask them to carry heavy equipment and other necessary weapons. On the battlefield, these walking soldiers lack adequate protection. Ordnance experts have therefore created body armor that protects the body without hindering mobility. This type of body armor is very suitable for snipers, accompanying engineering personnel, and battlefield photojournalists. Combat engineers especially need this flexible body armor when clearing landmines.</p>
<p>Rocket Engine</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy recently announced that it has created a test rocket engine, named Moby-Cick, which can be said to be the most powerful rocket engine in the world. It can generate 66,000 pounds of thrust in two seconds, which is one-third greater than the forward thrust of the German V2 rocket. The rocket engine's cylinder is 105 inches long, 17 inches in diameter, and weighs 1,500 pounds, half of which is the weight of the solid fuel.</p>
<p>Target-Seeking Radar</p>
<p>The British Navy is now using a state-of-the-art radar device called an Automatic Following Device (A.F. Device). When the radar emits a warning signal that enemy aircraft are approaching, simply turn the knob on the automatic tracker, and the antenna will immediately begin automatically searching the sky for enemy aircraft. Within seconds, it can determine the target of the enemy aircraft. When the device finds the target, it emits a green light, and the antenna automatically follows the movement of the target in the sky, automatically recording the target's path and speed direction. At the same time, this device can be linked to anti-aircraft guns, using electricity to enable the anti-aircraft guns to fire at enemy aircraft, with a very high hit rate. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Why Do We Eat Less in Hot Weather?</h3>
<p>— Tong Gao</p>
<p>What is the amazing mechanism inside the bodies of animals and humans that tells them when they are full and hungry? Scientists have always believed that the sensations of hunger, appetite, and fullness come from the activity of the gastrointestinal tract or from the so-called taste organs. Now, two Yale University scientists have proposed a new idea. Dr. John Brobeck and Dr. C. N. Long of the Yale University School of Medicine believe that the urgent need to eat is actually a need to maintain body temperature. Therefore, when the thermometer goes up, the consumption of food tends to decrease, and the activity of the body also slows down. Conversely, when the thermometer goes down, food intake and activity increase.</p>
<p>Many interesting things that happen to people when the temperature changes can be explained by this theory. For example, a football team becomes drowsy after a hearty meal in the warm October weather. Another example is people losing their appetite in extremely hot weather.</p>
<p>Drs. Brobeck and Long have demonstrated that when animals are in a hot environment, they eat less food but can still raise their body temperature.</p>
<p>They placed rats in rooms with varying temperatures, ranging from 65 to 97 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, the higher the temperature, the less the rats ate, and at 94 degrees they ate almost nothing. Compared to rats at 72 degrees, the food intake of rats at 94 degrees differed by as much as 400%!</p>
<p>Dr. Brobeck said that this theory can be applied to all cells that can digest food, and human behavior can also fit this general paradigm.</p>
<p>Scientific Anecdote</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Life</h3>
<p>— Liu Suisheng</p>
<p>The weather is warm, and all fruits are abundant. In addition to enjoying melons and plums, my wife prepared plum sauce for me. Her deep affection was unexpected and delightful!</p>
<p>I saw the clear water boiling, the green plums rising and falling, and bubbles forming. My wife then used a copper spoon to skim them off to ensure purity. I said, "Copper should not be used because fruits contain many organic acids, which combine with copper to form copper organic acids, which are highly toxic." My wife said, "A little bit shouldn't matter too much." After skimming the foam several times, she poured out the plum soup and divided it into two cups. I tried one and felt a slight strange taste in addition to the sweet and sour. My wife said, "Resources are scarce, it's a pity to waste them!" and finished one cup. Before long, she had a stomachache and vomited profusely before recovering, causing great distress!</p>
<p>On a hot summer day, I was lying on a high bed by the north window when I suddenly heard a noisy sound, knowing that the water carriers were bringing water. I said, "I don't mind paying a high price, I just want pure river water." The water carrier said, "It is pure river water!" I then verified it on the spot: first, I took the prepared pure river water and dripped silver nitrate solution into it, and the color did not change; then, I took pure well water and injected silver nitrate solution, and a milky white precipitate was produced, quite like soy milk; then I took the water from the water carrier's bucket to test, and I also obtained a soy milk-like substance, but the color was slightly lighter. I said, "You added a lot of well water! What do you have to say?" The water carrier was silent.</p>
<p>Gang'er is weak, so we ordered milk: every morning when it is delivered, the seal is always broken. I have already suspected that it is mixed with something—so I asked the milkman, "Why is the seal often broken?" He replied, "The long road is bumpy, how can it not be broken!" I then took out iodine and dripped it into the milk. I saw that wherever the iodine passed, it turned blue. I said, "It's mixed with soy milk!" The milkman said in shame and anger, "Doesn't Mr. know that the price of soy milk is not cheap?" Science reveals the adulteration of food, which can be confirmed.</p>
<p>My wife suffers from anemia, and according to the doctor's instructions, she takes organic acid iron supplements. One day, she poured a little into a cup, and Yin'er mistakenly added tea juice, and he said in surprise and delight, "Mom is going to drink ink!" This is because iron salt reacts with tannic acid in tea to form black iron tannate. Doctors always instruct patients not to drink tea after taking iron supplements, and this provides clear proof.</p>
<p>After class, my wife always prepares tea to wait for me. My wife said to me: "I heard you are specializing in popular science. Do you have anything to say about the floating and sinking of tea leaves?" I pondered for a long time before starting to answer. My wife joked, "Why are you silent, like a girl?" I said, "The floating and sinking of objects is based on specific gravity: an object sinks when its weight is greater than the weight of the same volume of liquid, floats when it is less, and can stop anywhere when they are equal. This is clearly stated in physics. After tea leaves are soaked in water, their specific gravity increases, so they sink; bubbles gradually form on the leaves, increasing their volume, so their specific gravity decreases, and they rise again; when they reach the liquid surface, the bubbles burst, increasing their specific gravity, and they sink again. If you don't believe me, please observe carefully." My wife smiled and said, "It's really interesting to get new scientific knowledge while serving tea!"</p>
<p>Time flies, and ten years have passed in an instant. Past events are like smoke, and emotions are like illusions. So I wrote this down to leave a lasting memory. It was the late spring of March in the thirty-seventh year, and the place was the Shanghai Municipal Xinlu Normal School Science Museum.</p>
<h3>Under High Pressure</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>Although we can use super tools to ascend to high altitudes and delve into the oceans tens of miles deep, we have never gone beyond the stratosphere or penetrated the earth's core. We only let the flowers of life bloom there, in a range with similar physical environments.</p>
<p>In this range, pressure, temperature, or other physical environments are almost the same from a cosmic point of view. Many substances encounter different "circumstances" in places we have never reached.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to thoroughly understand everything about matter and the architecture of this world, we must understand all the phenomena and principles of matter in various environments. From this, many knowledge and applied sciences have emerged; and with this knowledge, mankind has created their more dynamic world of life.</p>
<p>Among many physical environments, one is familiar to scientific researchers, but ordinary people generally do not feel that it has anything to do with them: "pressure."</p>
<p>In the past forty years, due to practical trends, we have spent a lot of energy to understand the problem of pressure, which has a great impact on all matter.</p>
<p>Scientists have long used a basic number for pressure to measure extremely high pressures. That is "atmospheric pressure." In the usual sense, it means that there is a pressure of fourteen, seven pounds per square inch, which is the force from the weight of the air.</p>
<p>Therefore, the pressure on the deep seabed is naturally different. Obviously, in addition to the atmospheric load, it also carries a long column of water; the pressure on the bottom of a six-mile-deep sea, when calculated, is equivalent to a pressure of one thousand atmospheres per square inch.</p>
<p>There is also a high pressure that can occur when gas expands in a constant-volume container. In cannons, the pressure generated by the gas expansion of explosives is often above two or three thousand atmospheres.</p>
<p>In the center of the Earth where we live, everyone knows that there is high-temperature magma, and only knows that volcanic eruptions are a spectacle, but does not understand that they are a manifestation of high pressure. Inside the Earth's core, surrounded by a quiet skin, exists an environment of 3.5 million atmospheres of pressure.</p>
<p>Humans cannot control such high pressures. The pressure that can be obtained in today's laboratories is only slightly more than one-tenth of that, equivalent to about 400,000 atmospheres per square inch. It is really a "small sorcerer compared to a great one."</p>
<p>However, nearly one-third of the matter on Earth is under pressure within this range, so it is enough for us to apply to the condition of matter under high pressure, and it cannot be considered small.</p>
<p>In fact, not to mention the high pressure of 400,000 atmospheres, which is very difficult to obtain and study in our laboratory, even in an environment of only 100,000 atmospheres of pressure (equivalent to 450 tons per square inch), many important and surprising facts can be discovered.</p>
<p>You may wonder how to obtain such a large pressure! Scientists have used simple principles, precision machinery, and clever methods to achieve their goals. Initially, the principle of using a hydraulic press, relying on fluid transfer to obtain high pressure, the difficulty was the inevitable leakage. Because high pressure cannot occur in a device that cannot be sealed tightly, but a solution was soon found.</p>
<p>The fluid container made at that time used excellent packing materials to reduce leakage to a minimum; and due to the creation of extremely high pressure, fluid leakage was automatically reduced, which is the self-tightening of the packing under high pressure. The higher the pressure, the less likely the leakage.</p>
<p>At this time, the factor affecting the acquisition of high pressure is no longer the leakage problem, but the material strength of the container (Strength) is determined.</p>
<p>Although we have alloys that are stronger than steel and can withstand high pressure, such as carbon-tungsten alloys, etc., under pressure, the strength is more than twice that of steel. But it is still not enough for such huge pressure requirements.</p>
<p>When scientists found that the material was not strong enough, they designed another method, which is the "sleeve method" that is mutually adjusted. This is the same principle as making cannon barrels with several steel pipes sleeved together. They added a lower high-pressure container sleeve to the outside of a high-pressure container. This can obtain the effect of gradually decreasing pressure and making the pressure difference smaller. And the strength of the material does not have to withstand the highest pressure.

<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>[Mr. Fang Chaoshun from Ningbo Road asks] Why are express telegrams sometimes rejected?</p>
<p>(Answer) The locations to which this bureau sends express telegrams are not universal throughout the country. Because the time limit is short (only two hours from sending to reaching the destination), if there is any slight obstruction in the line or the express telegrams are crowded, the acceptance will be stopped to maintain transmission efficiency. The letter did not indicate the date and location of the telegram, so it is impossible to verify. If there is no line obstruction, this bureau will never refuse express telegrams every day.</p>
<p>[Mr. Li Ningchao from Liyang Road asks] I often borrow the public telephone at No. 26, No. 969 Liyang Road. Each time, the charge is 30,000 yuan. After learning that your bureau stipulates only 20,000 yuan, the contractor obviously overcharges. I would like to ask you to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<p>(Answer) This bureau has sent a letter to the management to warn them not to repeat the same incident. If there is any violation, the machine will be dismantled. I also hope to assist in reporting.</p>

<h3>Why Not Eat Meat Porridge?</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>To be honest: if politics is not thoroughly clarified and bureaucracy is not thoroughly eliminated, then any piecemeal measures that hope to eliminate corruption, talk about administrative efficiency, if not deceiving people, are deceiving oneself.</p>
<p>Laying off redundant employees is not objectionable in principle, but to consider laying off employees as a clarification of official governance is something that even the person who says this knows is nonsense.</p>
<p>Someone once asked starving people why they didn't eat meat porridge, which only illustrates that this emperor was too far away from the people, not knowing how high the sky is and how thick the earth is. People who make this kind of argument today,</p>
<p>Don't they also know that people who work as civil servants today are probably in a semi-starved state, and would have left long ago if they had a way?——Is it really "the well-fed do not know the hunger of the starving"?</p>
<p>Apart from being an official, there are probably only two ways: industry and commerce. Industry is not for everyone, especially in a recession. As for doing business, not everyone can do business, let alone we are suffering from too many people doing business? Are the market men all over the world? Do we really want North China to become a "Chinese Commercial Country"?</p>
<p>Everyone can talk officialdom, but talking officialdom to people who are worried about being poor is not only teasing but also close to adding insult to injury?</p>
<h3>The Predecessor of Sherlock Holmes</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Conan Doyle's detective Sherlock Holmes is not purely a fictional character. Doyle was inspired by his professor Dr. Joseph Bell to create his immortal "genius detective." It can also be said that Sherlock Holmes is a portrait of Dr. Bell.</p>
<p>Dr. Bell was a distinguished surgeon who taught at the University of Edinburgh. Conan Doyle, novelist Stevenson, and James Barry were all his students. Holmes's reasoning and analytical rules are nothing more than reflections of Bell's actual life experiences. Bell said: Most people only see and do not observe. Looking at a person, you can find his nationality written on his face, his profession written on his hands, and the rest of his resume written on his walking posture, habits, watch chain ornaments, and the fibers attached to his clothes.</p>
<p>Once, Bell was teaching a class when a patient came. Bell speculated to the students that the visitor was a soldier in the Scottish Highland Regiment and may have been in the band. His reasoning was as follows: the visitor's high-spirited gait suggested that he was a Highland piper; and he was short in stature, so if he had served in the army, he might have been in the band.</p>
<p>But the visitor insisted that he was a shoemaker and had never served in the army. So Bell asked him to take off his shirt and found a small blue "D" branded on his skin. This was the mark branded on deserters in the army during the Crimean War. The visitor finally admitted that he had served in the band of the Highland Regiment.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Bell was sitting in the "Royal Hospital" when someone knocked on the door. "Come in," he said. A person came in. Bell stared at him for a while. "Why are you worried?" he said to the visitor.</p>
<p>"How do you know I'm worried?"</p>
<p>"Because you knocked on the door four times. People who are not worried are satisfied with knocking twice, or at most three times."</p>
<p>That person was indeed worried.</p>
<p>Bell wanted to prove to his students every day that observation is a science, not magic. In the "Royal Hospital," Bell glanced at a newcomer and then said, "I think he is a shoemaker." Later, he explained to the students, "The insides of the knees of that person's pants are worn out, which is a characteristic of a shoemaker. They use that part to clamp the shoemaker's anvil."</p>
<p>However, Dr. Bell was not infallible. Once, he asked a bedridden patient, "Are you a musician?" The patient replied, "Yes."</p>
<p>"You see, gentlemen," Bell turned to his students and said conceitedly, "This is very simple. This person suffers from cheek muscle paralysis, which is the result of excessive playing of musical instruments. We can confirm it by asking." He turned to the patient again and asked, "What kind of instrument do you play?"</p>
<p>The patient propped himself up with his elbow and said, "The big bass drum, doctor!</p>
<h3>Song Renying's British Book Helps Scholarship</h3>
<p>Professor Song Renying of Daxia University is excellent in poetry and prose, and his calligraphy and painting are also wonderful. His character is also praised by those who know him well. He is now specifically holding a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting at the Wuxi Fellow Association from the 19th of this month to raise funds for the Zengguang Yixiao and other expenses. The author has already feasted his eyes on the fine works displayed in the meeting yesterday, and felt that they were of noble temperament and profound accomplishments. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will take the time to visit, and if they are willing to buy a few paintings to give to relatives and friends, hang them on the plain walls and appreciate them from time to time, it will really be a way to please the mood and cultivate the character.

<h3>Duan Qirui's Chess Addiction</h3>
<p>— Fu Lu</p>
<p>Duan Qirui served as an official in the Qing Dynasty for a long time. After entering the Republic of China, he intermittently held power for more than ten years. He also once dominated the situation and occupied an important page in modern history. His merits and demerits will be determined in the future. However, apart from Go, he had no other hobbies, which is probably known to everyone. As far as I know, picking up one or two things is enough for conversation.</p>
<p>Before the Xinhai Revolution, Duan was transferred to the Jiangbei Admiral and stationed in Qingjiangpu. His son Junliang (named Hongye) also accompanied him to the official residence. He had a fatherly style of love for Go, and his skills were slightly between two or three moves. Living deep in the office, he suffered from a lack of opponents. He inquired and learned that there was Tianbaolou Teahouse in Pudi, where Go players gathered. From Chen to You, the sound of pieces falling was endless. So he went to drink tea and watch from the sidelines. However, the Zhejiang people only heard that Wen Manqing was good, and the rest were mostly mediocre. After reading it, he unknowingly improved his skills. He heard that the game was very rich in betting. He heard that he was unknown, but he was quite contemptuous of him. When he made a move, it was extraordinary, and he realized that he was a strong enemy. At the end of the game, he lost two sons. Before leaving, Junliang firmly made an appointment to go to his residence tomorrow to have a contest. When the time came, he sent someone to invite him. When he arrived, it was the Admiral's Mansion, which was shocking. He showed his name and sat down to play chess, and both sides did their best. Halfway through, an old man arrived, wearing a lake crepe cotton robe, with a short gray beard, and his mouth slightly crooked. Junliang stood up respectfully, and Wen also followed. The old man ordered to continue playing chess, and put his hands behind his back to watch from the wall. Wen did not dare to ask. After the old man left, Wen asked Junliang and said, This is my father. Since then, he often visited and played chess with each other. Duan's skills were slightly inferior to his son's. Sometimes he won over his father, and he would not be lenient for every piece. Duan's anger was visible in his face. After being defeated, he said: You can't do anything, you can only play chess!</p>
<p>At the same time, there was Wang Yanbai, who was also from Zhejiang. His family was good at calligraphy. He lived in the Admiral's staff and was in charge of making memorials. He was also good at Go. He served Duan in playing chess every day and got along very well. After the Restoration, Duan served as Prime Minister of the Cabinet and sent a letter to invite him to live in his residence. He was nominally a junior official and received a monthly salary. He accompanied him in one or two games every day and had nothing else to do. One day, while they were playing chess, a petitioner came. Duan then summoned him to the side, and the game did not stop. When he was about to leave, Duan stood up to introduce him and said: This is Mr. Wang, my old friend. If you need anything, he is not a crane that does not dance. The guest said yes, and hurriedly went to Wang Zhouxuan to make an appointment to go to his residence the next day. When the time came, he realized that he was the newly appointed Salt Transport Envoy of the Three Eastern Provinces, who had come to Duan for instructions. The next day, he went to Fengtian with Wang as the Bureau Chief. He served for many years and gained a lot. He retreated bravely and returned to Yanjing as a rentier.</p>
<h3>Children's Country</h3>
<p>— Guo Ping</p>
<p>In Yugoslavia, six miles from Belgrade, there is a children's republic. With a population of 5,000, they live in wooden houses on the hillside, ranging in age from six to fourteen. They run their own guards, post office, and railways.</p>
<p>Their railway is only six miles long and connects to the Belgrade railway. The children are very satisfied with this small-scale railway.</p>
<p>Part of the wood on the mountain has been felled for building houses. The children built roads around their own houses and planted many trees and flowers. Every child in this small republic has a job to do. When they hear the whistle, they quickly gather in the field, put on a uniform, and start working.</p>
<p>These children are well organized and elect their leaders, form a parliament, and elect members. They manage this small country themselves, with only a very small number of adults to carry out education, supervision, and assistance work.</p>
<p>They have an art exhibition room, displaying the photos of the children who have won excellent awards and competition champions. Of course, they also have various entertainment and leisure activities, so that they can also enjoy a considerable spiritual life.</p>
<p>This experiment of educating children on actual public life has attracted the attention of the entire Yugoslavia, and many Yugoslav elementary school students have visited this small republic.</p>
<p>This group of children is innocent and intelligent, and they live happily together, enjoying education and enjoying the fun of working.</p>
<h3>"Mending to Make it Pure"</h3>
<p>— Ma Bin</p>
<p>Occasional Fan Inscription: Intending to request someone to inscribe, leafing through collected works, selected from "Drinking Wine" number twenty:</p>
<p>"Xi and Nong have left us long ago, few in the world return to genuineness; the diligent old man of Lu, mends and makes it pure. The phoenix and unicorn may not arrive, rites and music are temporarily renewed; the sound of the Zhu and Si rivers is cut short, drifting until the violent Qin; what crime do poetry and books commit, becoming ashes in a single morning. These old gentlemen, are sincerely diligent in their endeavors; how can the world below cut them off, with none of the Six Classics familiar. All day long they drive their carts: not seeing the ford they seek. If we do not drink happily again, we will have lived in vain; but I hate many mistakes, you should forgive the drunkard."</p>
<p>Although the artistic conception of this poem is not worth mentioning, I deeply love its meaning; Yuanming, at the time when the Jin dynasty was about to move, resigned from his official position and retreated into seclusion, observing the meaning of his poems, he often compared himself to Jie Ni; in the twenty poems of "Drinking Wine," this meaning is even clearer, "All day long they drive their carts, not seeing the ford they seek," should be thinking of Confucius and regretting not being able to see him again; Yuanming's nature is indifferent, except for being similar to the Confucianism of Yanzi, he initially disagreed with the various schools of Confucius, but he had a deep understanding of the Confucian ideological system, for two thousand years, many scholars have spoken about Confucianism, but in the end, none has been as refined and clear as Yuanming's "The diligent old man of Lu, mends and makes it pure." "Mending to make it pure" is also the meaning of the "Doctrine of the Mean," but it can express the spirit of Confucianism more than the two words "Doctrine of the Mean." Moreover, the writing is elegant and beautiful, without the meaning of vulgar sermonizing; the corrupt scholars of the Song and Ming dynasties, talked grandly about the Doctrine of the Mean, making these two words even more unbearable, now that we have Yuanming's sentence, it is extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>"But I hate many mistakes, you should forgive the drunkard," Su Shi once praised these two sentences highly; I once said that Yuanming's claim of being drunk was actually just a slight buzz, "you should forgive the drunkard" is not something a drunkard can say, and there are endless secrets; in a world of war and chaos, it was not easy to seek to preserve one's head and finish, Ruan Ji feigned madness, Liu Ling indulged in alcohol, in fact, they did not willingly ruin their bodies, but wanted to cover up their true colors, it was unavoidable. Yuanming's situation was exactly like this, but he did it more naturally, so later generations mistakenly thought that Tao was born with indifference!</p>
<p>Yuanming was originally from a noble family, and he also ran around when he was young, when composing "Feeling of Not Encountering Talents," how could he not want to be a diligent old man of Lu? Seeing that "mending" was extremely difficult, he retreated to take care of himself, which is also human nature. Although madness and donations are different paths, they actually lead to the same goal, those who take care of themselves in a chaotic world, in terms of the entire human race, their contribution will definitely not be less than those who actively advance.</p>
<p>Reading Tao's collected works at this time, I feel even more the difficulty of being a person in a chaotic world, even with Yuanming's uninhibitedness and non-action, he still had to say, "you should forgive the drunkard," the rest of us can imagine, but we can only write Tao's poems on fan surfaces!</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>General Song Mingxuan (Zheyuan) stationed in Ping with the various righteous forces of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee before the "July 7th" Incident, at that time, the enemy's flames were already unapproachable, the General sought to preserve the overall situation, and supported it for more than a year, which was also very difficult. When the War of Resistance broke out, his subordinates, Generals Zhao Tong and Zhang, successively died for their country, Song also fought in the valleys, exhausted from overwork, and died of illness in Sichuan, buried his bones in the green mountains, and his integrity was flawless. And the insults and oppression imposed by the enemy during his tenure in "Hebei-Chahar" were beyond what ordinary people could bear. Such as the Fengtai Incident, such as the Qihua Gate Incident, were all due to the rampant behavior of the Japanese army, forcing Song's troops to retreat and submit. What was even more shocking was that a large team of tanks paraded in the city, and in Tong Square, they conducted offensive and defensive exercises, making Song's troops and police stare at each other, at a loss. Song had no choice but to entertain them, inviting Itagaki and other generals to a banquet, and ordering the Broadsword Team to dance with knives at the banquet, to entertain these "honored guests," because he had no power to resist, and it was inconvenient to remain silent, so he temporarily "prepared leisurely," expressing an attitude of "not caring at all," this was also a no-win situation, it can be said that he had done his best in "enduring," seeing that the situation was difficult, it was considered "bearing humiliation and burden," but in terms of personality, it was no different from "wiping one's face to dry." As the saying goes, "If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated!" But it did not start with Song, before the organization of the "Hebei-Chahar" Political Committee, unreasonable insults had been more than one instance, inciting local ruffians in Xianghe to govern themselves, employing hooligans and plainclothes in Tianjin to cause disturbances, acting sneakily, and still claiming to be a civilized and powerful country, and the leader of East Asia, it was truly shameless. I also remember that in the 24th year of the Republic, a Mr. Bai (an old member of the Tongmenghui, who ran a newspaper in the concession) was beaten to death in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, the Japanese chief suddenly found the Hebei authorities, flew into a rage, and made a large number of threats. In fact, since the case occurred in the Japanese concession, what were the Japanese troops and police in the concession doing? Instead of naturally handling it, they extorted the Chinese authorities, and later expanded the negotiations and forcibly put forward six articles, asking the provincial authorities, General Yu, and the central personnel in Pingjin to "take a step," pressing layer by layer, and oppressing them at will. Song Zheyuan's "Hebei-Chahar" was basically taking the stage by enduring anger. However, in the spring of the 26th year of the Republic, because the demand for "clarification" was endless (that is, completely separating from the central government according to the "East Hebei" puppet government), he really couldn't bear it anymore, so he fled back to his native place, Leling, and soon the "Lugou Bridge Incident" occurred. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's "humiliation" of China was all-encompassing.</p>
<p>After "July 7th," Pingjin was the first to fall, and it did become "clear" like "East Hebei." For the sake of international appearance and pleasing the citizens, they suddenly did some perfunctory things, and the appearance was much quieter. But the youth engaged in underground work and anti-Japanese activities were arrested by them, and they did their best to humiliate them, the world only knows that those detained in their teams suffered torture and were poured cold water, etc., but according to those who had been to "hell," "abuse" was still tolerable, but "humiliation" was really unbearable. For example, Wu Jixu and his wife, from the first class of the Journalism Department of Peking University, were highly talented students of the same class as Tian Pengyou and Luan, after graduation, they served in the newspapers and had a great reputation. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, he was the editor of the Tianjin Yishi Daily, after the chief writer Sheng Baotang died for his country, the newspaper also stopped publishing, and Qiu Chen and his wife hid in the British Concession, secretly organizing anti-Japanese propaganda for two years, and had long been listed on the "blacklist" by the enemy and puppets. In the summer of the 28th year of the Republic, the Japanese enemy blockaded the British Concession, and its arrogance reached the black people, the British side negotiated with Tokyo, and softened due to the situation at the time. The enemy captured Wu and his wife at night with the British police, Qiu Chen was beaten in addition, and sometimes was invited to sit down and talk, if a word did not agree, then he would be kicked and beaten at will, and the chief was laughing and joking. Zhu Bai, because she was a woman, was not beaten, but was ordered to do hard labor, which was worse than beating. In short, "scholars can be killed but not humiliated," but they insisted on "great humiliation and special humiliation."</p>
