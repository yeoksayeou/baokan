<h3>美國會邀麥帥·陳納德提供對援華案意見電囑陳氏於週內返華盛頓</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕衆議院外交委員會，今日邀請麥克阿瑟將軍及陳納德將軍，親自或以書面向該會陳述援華案之意見。衆院外委會請麥克阿瑟將軍陳述對援華及其他遠東重要區域建議案之意見醫。外委會並請麥克阿瑟將軍特別陳述下列二點之意見：（一）維持自由獨立對突友好的中國，對於世界和平及美國在一西太平洋地位及利益之重要：（二）爲完成此項目的起見，應採取何種經濟的或其他措施。衆院一外委會亦請陳納德提供類似意見　，並囑其在可能範　內於一週或十天內返美。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕陳綱德將軍於二日晨接得美國會外交委員會急電兩通，催促陳氏即速返美，向華盛頓當局報吿中國之一般情形，及渠對當前局勢之意見。陳氏暫時未有所表示。該電文又稱，盼陳氏於一週內抵華府。美方認爲陳氏在華有年，且於戰時建有殊勳，對於當前局勢自有明晰之觀察</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕靈通方面稱：若麥帥答應衆院外交關係委員會之要求，提出其對援華之意見，預料麥帥將要求以有效之美國軍事援助給予中國政府。彼等稱：該會之邀請麥帥乃主張以　多援助給予中國之共和然人士所促成者。麥帥將支持彼等之要求，以直接軍事援助予山國。官方傳稱：委帥　成以適當軍事援助給予中國以壓制共產黨·麥帥相信，中國問題乃根本之軍事問題，由經濟方式而無軍事援助給予中國，乃毫無用處。</p>
<p>〔合衆社副總裁房恩東京二日電〕一般而言，麥帥以爲中國局勢相當嚴重，麥帥於十二月中曾非正式稱，就美國之權益而言，渠感覺中國問題主要的還是軍事性。美國應立即大量以軍事援助給予國民政府，以防東北，華北或朝鮮之陷入蘇聯軌道之內。美國在東京之軍事專家早已感覺，如美國決定以大量軍事援助給予中國，撲滅中共軍不致成大問題。彼等指出，麥帥麾下駐西太平洋之美軍目前有充份之軍火，空軍及其他供應品，足以配備國軍至少十五師。</p>
<h3>溥儀漢奸罪冀高檢處提起公訴將要求引渡或通緝</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕偽滿「皇帝」溥儀，業經冀髙院檢査處以漢奸罪於二月十八日提起公訴·　辦此一案之檢察官于兆吉，係根　敵偽產業處理局移送　儀財產案起訴，俾　處理其財產。　法院方面表示，因浦儀塲蘇聯扣押，故此案可能經外交　徑，要求蘇一引渡，否則即下通緝令，但其勢力戒　案，似　疑問，　　處　局吿密者，其用意亦漢在獲行處理　儀財產之　舍，而　對人。據法院調査，　現在平有「王府」及花園各一處，　溥儀之父　淸攝政王載尙在平，故吿密所指浦儀之財產所有權問題，尙須經過詳細調査，外傳浦饑之其及子女二于人在平說不確。茲將冀髙院檢察處起訴書所列犯罪事實　後：「被吿原係遜渮皇帝，九一八事變後，與敵人勾結，出關組織僞滿政府，自任執政，旋即成立滿期帝國，充仛皇帝，繼續至七七變以後，以迄敵人投降，應予檢舉」。</p>
<h3>薄立特大聲疾呼請以一億元購軍火援華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約二日廣播：華盛頓訊，美國前駐蘇大使蒲立特，今日出席衆院外交委會作證，力促國會對華援助計劃迅速採取行動，主張除政府所提對華五億七千萬美元之經濟援助外，並供給一億美元購置軍火，以供中國政府之用。蒲氏謂：「美國之納稅人可以付出相當多之金錢，暫時使日本人生活下去，並在日本保持大量軍隊，以防共產主義之抬頭，但此種辦法不能持久。中國爲遠東之關鍵，必不能予以忽視。自一九四六年夏季以來，除美海軍及陸戰　遺留於中國之少量軍火外，中國軍隊未會從美國獲得一子一彈，後經　會之努力，刻始有半數之軍火　　運　途中。而在另一方面，蘇　自佔領滿洲以來，即以自日方所　獲之武器以及由自滿洲運走之日本機械在朝鮮與西伯利亞製造之新軍火，供給中國共產黨。吾人拒不以軍火給予吾人之友人，而蘇聊却在大規模武裝吾人之敵人」。</p>
<p>外委會共和黨要員伏里斯詢間　立特云：渠是否有蘇聯武裝中國共產黨之證據？據稱中共與莫斯科並無關聯。蒲氏答稱，中國已往之歷史，爲最好之證據，「早在一九三四年間，余任駐蘇大使之時，蘇方即發行小册十，題爲「中國共產黨之革命策略」。時間之限制，無列舉種種事實」。渠引歸　德邁將軍之言曰：「中國政府恪守對吾人之諾言，而吾人則未能信守對中國之諾言」。此點殊屬可恥，美國設法補償以往之失信，此其時矣。渠主張國會應設法自美國積存於日本之則潘陽可以挽救，不然，共產黨不惟將迅速佔有整個東北，且揚子江惟北亦將爲其席捲而去云。</p>

<p>關於台省工礦藥所需外匯問題，孫氏稱：臺省所需外匯並不多，一年兩年內只要有一億左右美元，所有全台灣的各種事業已可恢復。台港電力公司方面初步補充，只需幾百萬美元，鐵路也不過幾百萬，現在電力和鐵路運輸力量當然都還不够，但再要擴充的話，即使我們自已沒有辦法，也可以向美國進出口銀行貸借。這不是一種開支，我們可以在五七年以內償還的。台灣土產外銷所得的外匯也不少，可以拿一部份給台灣用，當可有助於台灣產業。關於國大會期及改革幤制事，渠答稱：國大召開的命令已經發出，到現在爲止，還沒有聽到展期之說。幣制是遲早要改革的，但改革幣制是須要充份準備的，現在還未聽說何時付諸實施。</p>
<p>解釋國代退讓問題</p>
<p>副言席對國代退讓問題，作如下解釋：這個問題完全是因爲提名手續沒有準備好而發生的，本來選舉法裏面有規定，一是簽署提名，一是政黨提名，但兩者之間的範圍沒有加以說明，因此有些國民黨員由簽署提名爲候選人，而且得了多數票常選，現在要他們退讓給友黨或本萬提名的候選人，在他們當選人本身說，當選是合法的，要他們退讓，多少有點不平；但在黨的紀律方面說，是應當退讓的。後來中央定了一個折衷辦法，就是對友黨的一定要退讓。這是遷就友黨；因爲非如此他們就不能當選，至於對本黨提名的候選人，退讓與否，則給他們自已選擇。</p>
<h3>國代名單即公布傳已由選總送呈國府國民黨應退讓名單亦經決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕據可靠方面消息：國代名單二日已由選總送呈　府，即將由國府明令公布。關於黨員退讓事，國民黨中央決定以黨議黨方式後，已將國民黨應與友黨之名單送交選總，一併轉呈國府。據茶負責人士稱；國代名單即由國府公布，三月廿九日將如期召開國大。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕大代表中央提名當選人聯　會於二月廿九日在京召開緊急會議，決議要案多起，希該會會員於三月十九日前到京報到，集體出席國民大會。</p>
<p>〔中央社杭州二日電〕浙省各縣市記者公會立委選舉，各競選人得票數如次：胡　中二七二三票，陳訓　四九三票，陳博生三四一票，程滄波三三八票，宋漱石·黃少谷各得一票。</p>

<h3>新的侵略勢力的興起</h3>
<p>美國國會自一月七日復會討論援外問題以來，忽已兩月；我們只聽到參衆兩院議員議論紛紜，從未　及問題的實際核心，但國際局勢在這兩個月內却發生了急劇的變動，世界的分裂爲兩個世界，益見露骨，使美國議員不能再議而不決了。因此參議院外交委員會主席范登堡便在會議中大聲疾呼，要求參議院迅述通過歐洲復興計劃，並主張集中全國的力量制止第三次世界大戰的爆發。其言有謂：『蘇聯之阻撓，固足使援歐計劃之前途發生障礙；但美國必須竭盡所能，將世界自危險中拯救出來。『范登堡氏的一席話，不僅充分表現出目前世界局勢的嚴重性，而且也說明了美援的迫切性；實在値得我們的重視。尤其是他警吿世人稱：新的侵略勢力正在興起，雖沒有指明蘇聯，但是所謂新的侵略勢力，是不言可知的。</p>
<p>前幾天，美國衆院外交委員會也發表一種報吿書，要求美國領導各國保衛「非共產主義世界」，否則美國則將而臨全世界的「暴力革命」。並提出十項結論：（一）共產黨有一個目標，此即「世界革命」是也；（二）共產黨以爲革命必須出之暴力；（三）共產黨毫無和平可以維持之觀念，而預料第三次大戰不久即將爆發；（四）共產黨認爲蘇聯是革命之主力；（五）共產黨最畏　蘇各國間之聯合；（六）共產黨亦畏懼非共產主義世界之復興或聯合；（七）共產黨採取冷戰之方式，以增强本身的實力，而削弱其他一切國家之實力；（八）除蘇聯以外之共產黨，均爲後進之伙伴或輔助份子；（九）共產黨之策略，係根據一種肯定之理論，其中心命題始終不變；（十）第二次大戰戰勝國對於歐亞兩洲之劃分，將由強權政治加以解決，而不採取談判方式加以協商。</p>
<p>這十項對於共產主義理論及策略的看法，不論是否準確，但是共產黨企圖發動暴力革命以及蘇聯現正在領導各國實行世界革會——，終是千眞萬確的事實，美國政界及文化界人士，對於共產黨運動的危險性，均有深刻的認識；論理共產主義是一種學理上的信仰，不致擾亂肚會秩序的；但是到了現在，却成了世界和平的威脅了。記得在三十年前，蘇聯社會革命成功之初，雖然也曾呌出領導世界弱小民族實行世界革命的口號，但還個政策不久即爲蘇聯所放棄，改採和平外交政策，共產主義威脅世界和平始趨和緩；但是在三十年後的今日，共產主義的勢力捲土重來，蘇聯的外交政策雖仍以「和平」「安全」爲基調，但已一變戰前的作風，不特巳在東歐及遠東樹起「鐵幕」，而且還要進一步，使環繞在蘇聯四週的鄰邦，都變爲她的附庸國，這種侵略政策的推行，已由「微」而「著」了。</p>
<p>我們固不願將世界分裂的責任，完全諉諸蘇聯；但是世界分裂的造成，不能不說由於蘇聯的領導東歐各國組織新共產國際，並揚言至必要時將退出聯合國機構，有以致之。自從去年九月起，世界的分裂愈演愈明顯，美蘇間的鬥爭愈演愈劇烈。在美國方面要援助歐洲各國復興經濟，以保持人民的自由與獨立；此在蘇聯方面則千方百計，阻挽美國援歐計劃的實施。因爲美國是民主國家，一切政治設施及外交行動，都要取得國會的通過，始能付諸實施，所以杜魯門總統或馬歇爾國務卿高呌援歐的口號，雖呌到唇焦舌敝；但是援歐計劃至今還在討論的階段；誠可謂『笛聲大雨點小」這是民主國家的傳統作風。但是在另一方面，蘇聯是一個集權的國家，說到做到，而且還可以雷聲風行，不受任何的牽制。　要反對美國援歐計劃的實現，不僅組　新共商國際，以命令的方式呌東歐各國拒絕美國的援助；而且對於需要及歡迎美　的國家施行壓力，使她們也不能參加歐洲經濟復具會議，捷克就是一個絕好的例子。捷克因爲需要西方國家的資金，本來是擁護馬歇爾計劃的贊助國之一，但經蘇聯干涉之後，也就聲明退出了。</p>
<p>蘇聯對美外交戰，並不以此爲止，而且還要進一步採取攻勢。二月五日有蘇羅互助條約的簽字，接着蘇匈也於一一月十八日簽訂互助條約；捷克經過這次政變之後，由捷共掌握政權，也就究全投入蘇聯的懷裏去了。最近蘇聯又迫着芬蘭簽訂互助條約，芬蘭雖然是一個新興的民主國家，人民監愛自由與獨立，但以大勢所趨，恐不能逃出蘇聯的手掌·這一連串的事實，實在足够刺激世人的神經，尤其在美國人看來，不　是芒刺在背，自然要深感威脅了。有一部分的觀察家說，蘇聯向外過發展，已到了飽和點，或將「適可而止」；便在另一部分人看來，西方國家對於蘇聯勢力的擴張，若仍採取「綏靖政策」，則蘇聯必將得寸進尺，繼續向外擴張；據聯合社記者的報道，今後蘇聯可能採取下列三項步驟；（一）使中立的北歐小國，即挪威與瑞典兩國，也成爲蘇聯的附庸國，（二）突破伊·土·希三國的防錢，俾在地中海上取得一立足之點；（三）由側而進攻英·美·法三國在德奧之地位，俾使法義兩國也爲共產黨所統治。這雖是聯合社記者的預測，但其可能性甚大，値得我們的重視。</p>
<p>蘇聯在歐洲，固然已在那裏自由行動；就是在亞洲，亦將放手一幹。我們敢說蘇聯在對美外交戰中，着着佔先：美國反而着着失敗。美國現行政策若不及時更張，那末歐亞兩洲以致整個世界的和平前途，都是非常黯淡的了；范登堡作迫切的呼籲，美國朝野應該格外重視，尤其是參衆兩院的議員，對於援外計劃，實在不應再議論紛紜，莫衷一是，而應該當機立斷，及時作賢明的抉擇了。</p>
<h3>華許本博士對記者報告探測積石山計劃已與我中央研究院商定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中美積石山勘測團之科學組主任華許本博士，昨日由京來滬，與美孚油公司及中航公司洽商該團旅途中之石油分配及其他技術問題·華氏原爲美波斯頓科學館館長，此次專因探險積石山事來華，在京五週，已與我國政府及中央研究院商定有關探測事宜，渠對中美兩方之合作精神，備致贊揚。</p>
<p>華許本博士於昨日午後三時，假百老匯大厦招待中外記者，就勘測積石山之技術問題，有所報吿，由行政院新聞局魏景蒙處長作簡短介紹後，即開始報告，略謂：</p>
<p>中美合作</p>
<p>抵華六星期來，因中央研究院及地質調査所之協助，所知己較初來時爲多。此次勘測爲中美合作，美方僅供給中國目前不能即有之設備及人才，例如雷達爲測高最主要及可靠之設備，美方有專家麥開氏參加，地理及冰河部門，美方有專家谷史威氏參加，中國之專家因環境關係，不能如美專家之能經常接觸阿拉斯加區之冰河探測，故此項人員亦由美國負責。凡中國之所能供給者，美方不再重覆。過去兩個月內，曾與中央硏究所合組一委員會，委員共十八人，包括中國之科學家及軍事代表，而由薩本棟博士主持，決定將來探險隊成行時，中國有科學家及軍官各三四人參與。</p>
<p>測量辦法</p>
<p>此行最初之目的，自爲測量積石山之高度，現則決定擴大及冰河及地形。過去地理學家僅知自陸地上測量，此次則擬自空中加以測定，谷史威氏對於空中測量一節，富有一經驗，測量之辦法可簡述如下：一探險隊之座機上，裝有高度表六一只，使飛機依一定之高度而飛行（此行約爲三萬呎），靠近積石山八十哩處有一廟宇，其海拔早已由中國之科學家精確測定，飛機在此目標上空，即以雷達電波測出其高度，然後再保特同一高度，飛臨積石山主峯之上，再以電波探測，兩者高度之差數，即爲積石山主峯之高度。雷達測量之錯誤率，不過百分之一至一點五，依此推算，將來之可能測差，亦懂爲三四百呎而已。至於氣候之好壞，對於測量工作並無影響·主峯之位置，因附近並無無綫電臺聯繫，故精確之經緯度不能算出，粗疏之估計，爲利用飛行之方向速度時間加以推算，與正確之位置，相差不致超過十哩·本隊現所致力者，僅爲空中測量，至於精確之地面測繪，須有經年之辛苦工作，此則尙待中國科學家之進行。</p>
<p>否認探鈾</p>
<p>記者至此，詢以外傳探險隊有探測鈾礦之使命，是否確實？華氏笑謂：無論在中國或美國，幾乎每週有人提出此問題，本人記得首先提出此問題者，爲芝加哥一記者，當時地質家谷史威答謂：如飛機裝有特種電磁之計算儀器，可探出一地面有無金屬礦存在，但尙不能一判明爲何種金屬，此種儀器體積太大，機上一經設置，隊　將無法容身，故此次之探險機中，決定不裝。</p>
<p>風學關係</p>
<p>亦有記者詢以何以選擇此時成行者？華氏答稱：第一理由，爲雷請與本八目前均有五個月之空閒，過此無暇；二爲探測積石山，三月份及四月至九月爲理想之時期，故決定此時成行。有詢以山峯蓋雪是否有妨探測？答曰：否，風則關係甚大，如風自西北兩方吹來，句吹走山巔積雪，我人則自由之西北方探測攝影，可便利不少。華氏並指出，積石山過去之無人實地探測，全爲地形及交通不便使然。</p>
<p>斥侵略說</p>
<p>關於共匪官稱雷　探險隊爲美國對華　西之軍事侵略一節，華氏斥爲無稽，並謂：此行完全爲科學性質，事實上每次飛行將均由中國軍官一名參加，以免飛行時接近或攝影一時觸及軍事目標。本人實不能想一像我人之發現及照片片，對於國共一兩方有任何軍事價値。余本八對一於中國政府及科學家之熱誠合作一，則至爲感謝。</p>
<p>出發時間</p>
<p>又雷諾本人，已於昨日自加利福尼亞之奧克蘭乘巨型之C87飛來華，預計本星期可牴上海，駕駛員即爲駕原子機打破環球飛行記錄之奧杜姆，雷諾座機抵滬一週後，即將飛京轉赴蘭州，籌備出發，屆時如氣候良好，兩星期後可啓程，否則可能延長至一個月·中國人員之名單，現已決定四人，其餘四名尙待商榷。又此次空中探險，事屬創舉，中外新聞記者要求隨行者甚衆，一切有待薩本棟與雷諾會商後決定，昨據華許本博士談稱：人數必受限制，唯一之理由爲氧氣供應不易，此項氧氣須自美國空運至東京，再運至上海，然後輸途至遼遠之蘭州。</p>
<h3>雷諾探險專機改定今日飛華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社加州奧克蘭二日電〕環球飛行家奧頓二日決定三日上午起飛，載運科學探險隊赴中國。因機械發生障碍，已兩度展延啓飛期·奧頓稱：座機係改裝之一解放式轟炸機，共載三十噸科學一配備，該機三日在加州檀島間可能被強勁之尾風侵襲，「吾人或許由氣候之故，再度改期起飛」乘客十六人中，有顧維鈞之子，及中國駐美大使館首席秘書顧君之夫人，兩人均係赴上海者。</p>
<h3>積石山攝影展覽六日起在滬舉行</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕西康省政府顧閒莊學本，於民國廿三年曾至靑海南部之積石山一帶，從事考察工作數月，攝有積石山宇峯阿尼瑪卿及黃河長江之源等照片甚多，此次美國雷諾氏來華，將於空中探一測該山，經與我中央硏究院等合一組中美積石山探測團，即將開始一工作。莊氏爲介紹該區地面之實况，出其十餘年前之舊作，舉行積石山區影展，曾於二月廿，廿一，廿二日在南京邊疆文化敎育館，陳列展覽三天，現莊氏已於上週返滬，定於本月六日七日，在復興公園門首之法文學會，舉行公開展覽。</p>

<h3>最近剿匪軍事白部長報告詞原文</h3>
<p>（續昨日第一版）我們知道共匪是有理論，有組織，有二十年的鬥爭技術，更有國際背景，不能看着普通匪寇，或與過去軍閥勢力抗戰中的個人相提並論，因今天共匪所竄擾地區，民衆受其脅迫，完全匪化，所以現在剿匪不僅是軍事和政治的鬥爭，更是思想的鬥爭，必須以三已主義來打擊共產主義，以組織的力量來打擊共匪的組織，更具體的說，是要以軍事的力量來掩　政治，以政治的力量　全基肝，來配合軍事，要使黨政軍一　力量結成堅强　戰鬥體，並積極組訓民衆，增强民衆自衛力量，配合軍隊，發展全面戰術，爭取　剿匪應以三分軍事，七分政治，政治上首須收攬人心，發揮民力，以適應剿匪軍事，綏靖地方。而在經濟上，則須安定民生，才能消弭亂源。自辛亥起義，推翻滿清專制，是爲實現民權主義，北伐時打倒軍閥，也是爲實現民權主義，對日抗戰八年，是爲實現民族主義，目前剿匪，是要實行民生主義，所以除了以政治與軍事力量剿匪以外，更須經濟的剿匪，經濟上必須澈底實行民生言義，平均地權，簡制資本。記得民國十三年，本黨第一次全國代表大會，便有二五减租的決議，可是未即實行，共匪却在其佔領區內實行其「土地改革」，在國際上誇大宣傳，更利用淸算鬥爭的殘暴手段，强行分配土地，其分配辦法，即按某地農民人數與土地總面積，平均分配，決不顧惜少數地主資本家的利益，犧牲少數來爭取大多數的農民。對於綏靖區被共匪非法分配的土地，中央前曾頒布綏靖區土地處理辦法，其主要原則‘，即厲行二五减租，嚴禁地主撤佃，及追繳舊欠，文經非法分配之土地，地主失踪者，即由縣政府徵收。國家百分之八十的人口是農民，我們經濟的基礎不應重在都市，而是在廣大的農村，因此我們要使多數農民不爲匪所威脅利誘，必須澈底實行民生主義，土地政策，達到耕者有其田之理想，必須整個民生問題得到解決，才不致因生計壓迫，受匪煽動，挺而走險，同時藉自足以促進自衛，培養其自衛力量，保衛鄉土，安定社會，也才是根絕共匪正本淸源之道。我們知道，國際共產主義的發展，是在第一次世界大戰以後，世界上勞資的對立，貧富懸殊，引起了階級鬥爭，此次大戰後，在歐洲如波蘭，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，匈牙利等國，也都演成了第三國際的附庸，所以今天就國際局勢言，如仍以資本主義來實行反共，世界各國勞苦羣衆則仍難免階級意識重於民族意識，階級觀念重於國家觀念，階級利益重於國家利益，予共產主義者造成煽動階級鬥爭之機會，而不能消除勞資的糾紛與對立。英國當此次大戰後，爲渡過經濟的難關，厲行節約，上自英王，下至一般民衆，都絕對以守法精神奉行國策，同時更積極的是將大規模的礦塲·工業·鐵路·銀行·多數收歸國營，用政治力量實行社會政策，作更積極的反共　。因此就國際局勢觀察，我們要實行經濟的剿共，安定民生　，求民生主義的早獲實現，一面加强民衆自衛力量，配合軍事淸剿，乃是杜絕共匪發展，削弱匪患的根本方策。以上是崇禧感想所及，提出貢獻的一點意思，敬請各位指敎。（完）</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶錄（三八）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>健康崩潰前最後一椿工作</p>
<p>摩根韜部長自魁貝克回到華盛頓，總統則先到海德公園去，邱吉爾首相到那裏拜訪他。摩根韜對自己所完成的工作，興奮異常，拿着他的最新拷貝的計劃，（係指將德國變成一個主要是農業國的計劃——編輯人新聞服務社）趕來找陸軍部長史汀生與我，和其他的人。</p>
<p>一九四四年九月二十日，我在我的辦公室中，召開了一次內閣小組會議，出席者有摩根韜，史汀生，財政部的懷特（Harry　White），陸軍部次長麥克勞埃和國務院的馬秀烏斯等，以檢討這些發展·我並不掩飾，對於總統和邱吉爾先生，在摩根韜堅持下在魁貝克所協議的事情，大感震驚·我認爲就一切方面說，這部是一個悲劇。我强調稱，我並不認爲這件事已成定局。</p>
<p>摩根韜說，總統當初邀他到魁貝克去，對於他完全是一種意外，他不願意人們覺得是他策劃這件事。接着，他對於魁貝克會議的情形，發表了一長篇解釋。他說邱吉爾先生起初極力反對摩根韜所提的對德政策。首相會率直地問，他是不是被邀到魁貝克來討論一種「把英國傳在死屍（德國）上」的計劃的。</p>
<p>摩根韜轉向史汀生，對他說：哈萊，他比你還要惱怒·對於摩根韜進行魁貝克商談的專橫方式，史汀生和我一樣的惱怒。因爲這主要原是國務院和陸軍部的事，他並沒有和我們預先商量，而他對此事也不作任何隱飾。</p>
<p>摩根韜說，後來他和首相的私人助理齊威爾爵士（LordCherwell）討論這偭問題，顯然說服了他。齊威爾和邱吉爾討論後，就贏得了他的同意。這個建議，顯然是以英國從此可獲得許多德國以前的鋼鐵市塲，消除一個危險的競爭者爲理由，而打動了首相。摩根稻說，他們嘗試多次想把這種諒解寫成文件，但沒有一次能使首相滿意，於是他把自己的秘書召了來，口述他對協議事項的諒解。這就是總統和首相簽署，並於九月十五日拍發給我的文件。摩根韜說，這全部是由邱吉爾先生起草的。</p>
<p>史江生坦白地問摩根韜，邱吉爾接受這種政策，和他的急於想獲得摩根韜所應允他的借款，這其間是否有甚麽關聯。摩根　加以否定的答覆，但是他說　這筆借款顯然是首相在魁貝克除軍事外的主要目標。</p>
<p>摩根韜說，次日外相艾登到魁貝克，對於總統和首相關於德國的協議，大爲驚訝·艾登和邱吉爾先生熱烈討論，邱吉爾首相呌艾登在他自己沒有返英之前，勿先在戰時內閣中提出，因爲他準備努力使它通過。</p>
<p>摩根韜說，艾登的反對出乎他的意外，因爲不久之前，在倫敦他和艾登討論時，他曾得到相反的印象。這句聲明使我們知道了，甚至在魁貝克以前，這位財政部長就會和英國官員，討論過這件主要是屬於國務院和陸軍部事情。</p>
<p>關於借款方面，摩根韜說，他知道總統預備完全接受首相的意見。但是他摩根韜，却堅持要成立一個委員會來擬定計劃。他似乎並不覺得這個委員會可以獲得英國的合作，來實現一種自由經濟政策，但他覺得這樣至少可以讓美國軋進一脚。他說，關於酬答我們的援助，英國應採何種經濟政策一點，總統沒有提出任何問題。　我毫不顧忌地說，對於決定這種重大問題，事前並沒有和我們政府中的適當專家商談，也沒有顧及到我們過去所推行的政策，我極爲驚異。　總統回華盛頓後不久，我到白宮去看他。我隨帶了他在九月十五日給我的備忘錄和摩根韜的計劃。（九月十五日的備忘錄中稱，總統和邱吉爾先生對於摩根韜計劃的內容已獲協議——編輯人新聞服務社。）</p>
<p>我率直地向總統設，摩根　的計劃毫無道理，並沒有任何專家，也沒有我們政府中的有關官員，或總統，和其他國家政府參預準備這個計劃。我又說，摩根韜的計劃將消除德國的一切，除了土地以外。德國人必須靠土地爲生。這就是說，僅有百分之六十的德國人，能靠德國的土地生存，其餘的百分之四十將死去。</p>
<p>我說，對於處理戰後德國問題，我將記住兩個要點。第一，德國必須在軍事佔領之下，爲時廿五年或五十年，看需要而定，直到他們完全消除了納粹的一切理輪和觀念，以及德間是優越民族，有　利統治其他民族的荒謬觀念。第二點，德國人的生活水準，應該在　國人民平均生活水準以下，但應　着他們改變納粹主義，民族優越感，轉向人類權利，個人自由，與和平思想的程度，而逐漸提髙。</p>
<p>我最後說，我竟發覺英國人在魁貝克也贊同了這種極端的飢儀政策，其爲的，無非是想得到摩根韜的援助，獲得財政部所建議的六十五億元借款。我特別指責這個借款。</p>
<p>第一個理由，我說，和英國商談，主要應由國務院主持，因爲這是政府所設用以和外國政府進行談判的機構。第二，因爲摩根韜的計劃，並未附有條件。而我們和英國之間，懸有許多問題，我們應該韓求解決或行動，而借款可以做爲我們對英國人討價還價手段的一部份。摩根韜攔置或忽視了這些問題，奄無條件地允諾六十五億元借款，並沒有和國務院或國會中有關的政府官員們事先商談。</p>
<p>我最後說，撇開反對這個計劃的其他重大理由不談，如果摩根韜的計劃一旦漏出而總統是贊同道計劃的，對於他在政治上的地位亦將是極大的損傷當時他正在進行一九四四的總統競選。</p>
<p>在這次談話中，總統話說得很少，除了指出他實際上，還並沒有完全信從摩根韜的計劃事實上，他還沒有覺察到他簽署過＂O．K．F．D．R”的，那份九月十五日備忘錄，是具有何等重大不利的性質。</p>
<p>這時我請我國務院的同僚帮助我準備好給總統的另一個備忘錄。這個備忘錄的日期是九月廿九日，我在十月一日親自交給總統，並與他討論其中主要數點。</p>
<p>次日，我收到總統在九月二十九日寫給我的備忘錄，這是我十月一日和他談話以前寫的這備忘錄充份表現出他沒有認淸在糜根　從慫恿之下，他在魁貝克被牽累的程度·</p>
<p>他寫道：「局勢的主要廠結，是在防止英國在戰爭結束時完全破產」·他特別着重最後一句，在旁邊用墨水劃了兩條綫。</p>
<p>在過去一星期中，報紙上有好幾篇文章指出，在魁貝克所討論的，處理戰後德國的嚴峻性質·這成爲納粹宣傳機關的有力武器，激勵德國人硬打到底。</p>
<p>總統在他的備忘錄中說，「有人不僅過早地吿訴了新聞界，成是說（原文如此）根本上不正建事的實·</p>
<p>「沒有馳要使德國再爲一個完全優察的國家，但是却有人把它吿訴了新聞界，我希望我們能査出這個人來，予以　盧。</p>
<p>（史汀生部長後來吿訴我，總統以爲消息是由國務院漏出去的，史汀生說，施給總統脅，第一個談判這件事的專欄作家的文章，而這位作家是和財政部其些官員有密切聯緊的，才使總統相信消息不是由國務院或陸軍部瀾出去的）·</p>
<p>總統接着寫道，「你知道，職前德國不僅樹立戰爭工業，並樹立了充份的國外貿易，使它有足够的財力重整軍備，而仍能維持國際信用，不致在國際經濟間破產·</p>
<p>「我不能同意這種觀念，眼看大英帝國在財政上崩潰，而却讓德國構成一種潛在的重整軍備工業，使它可能在二十年內再發動一次戰爭。僅僅察查工廠並不能防止這一點。　「但是沒有誰要「完全消除魯爾和薩爾區的德國工業生產力」。</p>
<p>「但我們可能在那兩個特殊區域內，實使全面管制。同時，還應記住，除了魯爾和薩爾以外，德國還有許多其他的（他在「其他的」下面劃了一個綫）區城和設備，能够生產大量的出口物資」。</p>
<p>說起蘇聯，關於我堅特任何有關德國的計劃，必須和蘇聯政府商談一點，他說：</p>
<p>「關於蘇聯政府，我們的確還不知道他們肚裏有些什麼主意，但是我們應該記住，在他們的佔領區內，他們多少總要照他們的意思做的，我們將僅能做到時時抗議的一點而已，除非有的抗議能得到注意。　「我並不是想以此中止或延緩和蘇聯政府商談租借法案，不論是以全稱監督爲基礎或以所提議的第四草案爲基礎，但是，這並不和德國的工業前途直接有關」。</p>
<p>我和總統在十月一日的談話，使我已經不必再對他的備忘錄採取任何行動了。但是這備忘錄使我了解總統探求的思想綫索。在他的思想中，英國的未來，是和德國的未來成敗相關的。戰後，英國必須恢復她的出口貿易，但是他覺得如果准許德國發展强大的出口貿易競爭，則英國的出口貿易就不能恢復。所以，他採納摩根韜的計劃·但是他忘記了，雖然邱吉爾在這協議上簽了字，英國是最不希望將德國變成一個最業　　的，因爲如果破　的總鐵使歐洲經濟崩潰，　　備編英國的生計·</p>
<p>總統的備忘錄還淸楚　示一　，就是他沒有了解他在魁貝克所協議的事項的意義。大的就在這時，史汀生部長和總統談過一次話，史汀生也得到同樣的結論。他吿訴我說，他會讀了幾句總統九月十五日的備忘錄給他聽，結語是：「準備將德國變成一個主要的是農業和畜牧的國家」。</p>
<p>史汀生吿訴我，據統聽到這些句子，坦白地表示懷疑，並且說，他不知道怎麽會在這備忘錄上簽字，他願然是沒有經過怎樣思索就簽字的·</p>
<p>總之，我和他談話以後，總統不再採納摩根　關於德國的意見，他在收到我九月廿九日的備忘錄後三星期即十月二十日，給了我一個答覆。他在開頭說：「我覺得，我們來做處理德國的各種準備，全都合適，不過關於這種處理的若干事情，使我覺得目前並不急需辦理。這也許要在一星期，也許要在一個月，也許要在幾個月以後，我不欲對一個我們還沒有佔領的國家擬具詳細計劃。」</p>
<p>他說，他同意我們解除德國軍備的計劃，並建議應把一切和飛機有關的都包括在內。他衷心贊同我們解散納粹黨和其有關組織，以及廣泛控制交通，報紙和宣傳的計劃。他同意我們的建議，對於將來可能的瓜分德國一點，不應有何決議。關於經濟目標方面，他說：「對於若干文字方面，我願意和國務院再討論一下。在原則上，我表示同意，但我不知道若干部份的奇義。這一部份的問題，多半要看我們和盟軍進入德國以後，所遇到的實際情形而定，——但是現在我們還沒有到德國呢」。</p>
<p>我和我的同僚們，在九月四日和二十九日備忘錄中的意見，陸軍部方面大體是贊同的，後來英國和蘇聯也表同意，大致也就成了佔領德國後所實施的政策。摩根韜繼續支持粉碎德國的理論，他的意見對於盟國對德計劃有一種相反的作用，結果成爲比我辭職前，我們在國務院中所想到的，更嚴峻的計劃。但是，佔領德國的數年經驗，加上事實，證明我們所稱德國的經濟和歐洲的經濟密切相關一節正確不誤；結果使英美政府放棄了那種理論。</p>
<p>我和總統在十月一日的談話，是我在他任內，最後的一件重要工作，當時我的健康已瀕於崩潰，不得不提出辭呈了。</p>
<h3>梅農胡世澤飛漢城將監督南韓選舉漢城學生示威發生衝突</h3>

<p>梅氏希望代表團工作能獲成功。渠稱：此舉將顯示對達成獨立及自由朝鮮目標之「一大進步」。梅氏透露：五月九日朝鮮舉行選舉之日期，乃渠在通過太平洋長途電話中，向朝鮮美軍司令霍奇將軍建議者。渠解釋五月九日之期，便於朝鮮農民之參加投票，且有充分時間，可資準備。</p>

<h3>安定物價有效辦法參會通國三項建議設置公用事業調查會經濟激辯後通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日下午舉行第六次會議，繼續討論提案，大會中對於如何穩定物價案（包括臨時動議及其他提案共四件）苜先討論，經根據特種審査委員會審査意見，修正決議如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於外匯分配及掛牌部份：（二）建議中央，請政府對於進口糧食·棉花·機器·工業原料，及公用事業，交通事業燃料之外匯，增加其數額，並妥擬辦法，充分利用私人自備外匯及私人國外存款，輸入上項物資。（二）建議中央，對於外匯牌價，儘量避免隨時提高。（三）建議中央，對於僑匯，除按牌價結匯外，應酌予貼補。（四）建議中央，鼓勵出口物資，儘量輸出，以便增加外匯收入。（五）建議中央，從速採用進出口連鎖制度。</p>
<p>（二）關於政府掌握物資及拋售價格部份：建議中央，對於中央駐滬掌握物資各機關及公營事業機關，應任用熟悉工商業實際情形人員主持辦理，儘量收購本國工廠製成之日用必需品，以利國貨產銷而便資金週轉，並不應專以牟利爲目的，當配合目前戡亂國策，配售供應物資，穩定物價，如萬不得已，必須酌量調整其供應物資之售價時，至少應於事前徵得地方政府之同意後施行。</p>
<p>（三）關於公用及交通事業之價格如何穩定部份：建議中央，對於公用事業及交通事業恢復貼補制度，至少對於各該事業所必需之材料及燃料（如煤柴油及汽油）請政府在三個月期內規定相當穩定之配售或結匯價格，以期减少公用事業及交通事業漲價之因素。</p>
<p>又參議員王國賢提議恢復工貸問題，則將另作提案後再討論。</p>
<h3>調查公用事業翟鋮反對保留</h3>
<p>大會除上項提案外，復討論關於公用提案者共九件：（一）關於「請大會組織公用事業調査委員會審核各公用事業實際成本，以减輕市民負祖」一案，辯論最爲熟烈。該案經公用委員會討論之審査意見暫爲保留，其原因蓋此一專門問題，參議員派代表調査，恐得不到結果，同時參議會信任政府，應由政府負責辦理。但瞿鉞堅決反對保留，認爲參議員不應怕負責任，亦不應以非專家而不予調査，設以法官而言，每種問題，未必均爲專家，但仍須盡審判之責。同時政府方面如遇到困難，參議會亦應分担之。公用局長趙曾珏亦起立表示：希望參議會考慮成立一調査會，俾可使市民代表，切實明瞭公用事業實際成本及其價格。</p>
<h3>一派表示未必有效</h3>
<p>另一方面贊成保留者爲數亦多。陸蔭初表示主管機關對於公用事業成本之情形及調查技術，均較參議會淸楚，自應由政府辦理，同時亦應使政府發揮其能力，如有失責，則參議會應加監督。張志韓建譏由市政府派代表或聘請人員組織，參議會不必「掮木梢」。李文杰亦謂：參議會要做之事甚多，而參議員各人亦有很多之事，今若費去許多時間，而又是鬥外漢，調査出來，未有效果，故不主張由參議會負責。</p>
<h3>民調會請示中央配米價能否減低多區市民尚未領得配證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市全面配米積極展開，楊樹浦楡林二區若干市民前日起已開始憑證購米。閘北區昨亦開始·吳市長前限各區須將配米證於三”前發至每一民手中，但至今尙有多區市民未曾領得該項配米證。民食調配會巳分別督促·據調配會主委任顯羣談稱：配米開始所遭遇之最大困難，爲各區延誤發證時間，對工作推進深受影響。　截至昨日止，運滬之美國救濟米已到萬餘噸，日內尙有一千餘噸到達。本月份在滬配售之救濟米約可得法幣一萬億元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕民調會主委任顯羣氏昨晚急緊向中央請示，對於配售米二四〇萬元，是否可以跌價。因所配係秈米，市塲上杜秈價二五二萬元，門售加百分之六之利潤，應爲二六七萬元。但上杜秈每石實重一五六市斤，政府按每石一五〇斤計算，應打九六折，祗二五六萬元。但米店利潤事實上不需百分之六，故昨日上杜秈門售價有售二四〇萬元之事實，因此民調會不得不請示中央，是否隨同跌價。</p>
<h3>國恩寺追悼沈鐵錚</h3>
<p>同盟會會員沈鐵錚，去冬返里被匪坑殺，辛亥革命同志會特發起於昨日下午二時在普安路國恩寺舉行追悼，中央各部會首長陳立夫·朱家驊·張道藩均致送挽詞，到黨政首長方治。吳國楨（王冠靑代）·祝平及辛亥老同志三百餘人。方治主祭，袁希洛·季栖雲·洪承點·王兆麟陪祭。奏樂行禮後，王震報吿沈烈士革命事略及被共匪殺害情形，旋由方治袁希洛等演說，勗勉同志發揚烈士精神。儀式至五時結束。</p>
<h3>市長折衷辦法多數表決通國</h3>
<p>相持之下，吳市長發表意見稱：去年有半年時期，外匯燃煤均不漲價，使公用事業價格非常平穩，市民均謂各局中以公用局長听辦事業最佳，然趙局長非常謙虛，不自認有功。現在情形不同，外匯燃煤均漲，公用事業焉得不漲，而趙局長被各方指責，則本人亦不能承認其爲過·但參議會攻擊市政府，是一極好現象，因此可使市政改良，故本人對本案建議一折衷辦法，即此項調査委會，可由公用局組織，負其全責，參議員不必負責，因負責後即不能攻擊，參議員可以觀察地位參加，可以發言，詢問，又可明瞭其中情形。市長言畢，陶百川仍贊成參議會應該調査關於公用事業之各種問題。最後由議長提付表決，結果贊成保留者少數。結果逐採取邵永生建議，通過組織調査委會，其辦法如次，（一）由大會設立公用事業調査委員會，授權審核各公用事業成本計算是否正確合理，而硏究公正之標準計算方法，送請市府參考。（二）調查委員由大會公推二十五人，及各小組委員會每組推代表一人共同組織之，並以正副議畏爲電然委員，由議長召集之。（三）調査工作得分組進行，經全體委員會通過調査報吿後由本會送請市府參考。</p>
<p>機動三輪車案送公用局研究</p>
<p>（二）關於「取消汽車限額配油辦法，以消滅黑市」一案，小組審査意見爲建議中央取消汽車限額及准予汽車過戶並嚴禁小客車進口。但大會中由有反對取消者，如張志韓，費樹聲等認爲應有限制，藉以節省外匯，周祥生，處舜等則稱汽油限額與外匯無關，仍應取消。經表決後，此案保留，仍按現行辦法辦理。但據公用局趙局長表示：機關團體，若有特殊需要，須增加其汽油用量者，則可說明理由申請。</p>
<p>（三）「爲便利交通，符合節約，呈請大會討論新製機動三輪車，以便在本市行駛」案，審査意見暫爲保留，其理由有二：（一）因上海各種車輛原已充塞，再加上新車後，交通將更難維持，（二）對其安全問題，値得硏究，故主張緩辦。但有邵永生，瞿鉞等多數參議員表示人民新發明事業，應予鼓勵，至少應給予試行機會，結果決議「本案送公用局研究試騐」。</p>
<p>規定一華里內裝一公共電話</p>
<p>（四）關於裝置自來水龍頭等案均合併決談：請公用局根據本會歷次大會決議，關於供給平民區自來水決議案迅速辦理，並希於短期內完成給水站三十處·（五）「請上海電信局在閘北及四郊裝置公共電話，以利市民而固治安」案，大會決議：由本會電請交通部轉飭迅速辦理，並請上海市政府轉函上海電信局。辦法：擬請電信局儘量接受市民之請求裝置，公用電話，設調査後認爲必需，不得以無空綫爲搪塞，並規定一華里內裝設公共電話一具。（六）査本市電話公司，對電話用戶去函申請添設分機，每藉故稽延或音訊杳然，致延長通話時間，影響用戶便利案。決議：請本市電話公司，嗣後凡用戶申請裝設分機，力求便捷，並在同一用戶自備合適之電話機裝設分機者，得予以自由。（七）中區外灘碼頭禁止停靠貨船，以整市容，而利交通案。決議：送請市府修建第十號至十八號碼頭及倉庫，限期遷移並令機帆船先行改泊南市碼頭。辦法：請市政府令飭公用局，即日起重新規定中區外灘各碼頭專供公共交通之用，嚴禁停靠貨船及起卸貨物，並規定所有裝載水菓鷄鴨魚鮮船隻，必須改往十六舖一帶碼頭停靠卸載。</p>
<h3>兎死狐悲　財政局職員投江自殺兩局同人募捐助遺屬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政局職員陸濠，因爲太太病了兩個多月，眼看已經無救，自己再亦拿不出錢來替她醫治，爲了不忍目睹她嚥下最後一口氣的慘狀起見，竟悄悄的投江自殺了。</p>
<p>報紙上又記載他太太因爲　天沒有看到丈夫，病狀更爲嚴重，連話都說不出了，又沒人照顧，要想喝杯開水都難辦到。當社會局專員楊鉅松讀到了這悲慘的新聞時，深爲感動，就發起捐助受難者的家屬。這提議立即獲得了社會局全體同人響應，局長吳開先爲表示贊同起見，首先捐助一百萬元，其他各同人亦莫不解囊相助。社會局員工福利社爲這募捐運動而起草的宣言說得够沉痛：「我們同屬公務人員，大有兎死狐悲之感，雖然和陸濠先生一樣的窮，但是我們還在掙扎，還能掙扎！我們應該在精神上寄以同情，在物質上予以濟助。」社會局員工福利社日內彙集了這筆捐款，就將派員送交受難者的家屬。</p>

<h3>義屋得主次第揭露　輪渡司機不敢自信紗廠學徒爲人作嫁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕乙種房屋義實券開獎後，中獎的五十位幸運者的姓名身份，從昨天起已在陸續揭曉中。</p>
<p>市輪渡公司有一位司機名呌周信成中了獎，昨天他看到報上刊出的號碼還有些不敢信任，一淸早特地跑到冬令救濟會房屋義賣組去核對，一看果然不錯，這才歡天喜地的走了。他的號碼是帝字〇一九九四號。</p>
<p>榮豐紗廠憶定盤路紡紗部主任黃國楨，前幾時呌他廠裏的小學徒在憶定盤路一家烟紙店裏買了幾張獎券，其中一張文字〇二八四一就居然中獎。榮豐紗廠的廠長覺得這小學徒手氣不錯，昨天特地再派他到市商會冬救房屋義賣組去買大批田種獎券。這一位小學徒在買券時講起此事，旁邊另外一位買券的客人聽了大爲心動，也託他代爲選舉了幾張號碼</p>
<p>新新公司去冬舉行大减價並贈送房屋義賣券，凡購貨滿二十萬元可得贈券一紙，憑贈劵廿張可換義賣券一張。襪子部職員方成舟朱榮莊洪文達三人在無意之中也積滿了二十張贈券，共同向公司換到了　字〇一一一八的義賣券一張，想不到居然中獎，他們已在商量如何分配了。</p>
<p>此外已經證實　獎的有中‘國文化服務社職曹鳳台，立信會計師事務所職員七人（合購一張），及地政局職員莊某等。冬令救濟會房屋義賣組的全體職員會合夥員了二百四十餘張，却是一張未中。其中重字組第一〇二六九號與一〇二七一號都由他們所買，可是獨缺中獎的一〇二七〇號。這一張一〇二七〇號，據說還免開獎當天的早晨，才被一位女性買去的。</p>
<p>至於未售出的九萬餘張存券中有無中獎，昨日尙未知悉，這一個謎，須待明日將存卷啓封後始能揭曉。</p>
<h3>領獎三部曲四月底得屋</h3>
<p>房屋裏賣劵中乙種劵得主之領獎手續，昨據冬令救濟會房屋義賣部負責人稱：凡乙種房屋券得獎人，第一步可親自持中獎之獎劵至市商會房屋義賣部査騐，由該部派員核對存根及騎縫圖章，經騐核後確係屬該部所發行之券票，即由該會發給證明文件。第二步該得獎人可憑該會發給之證件，及中獎獎劵，自本月五日起，至塘山路市參議會三樓冬令救濟會掉換收屋證書。此項收屋證書業已印竣，極爲美觀大方·第三步，乙種房屋於四月底可全部完工，其地點分佈於四處，中正西路一五〇三號有七幢，林森西路有十六幢，武夷路七〇號有十一幢，武夷路七號有十六幢，共計五十被。該部將於四月底召集各得獎人再度抽籤抽定所得之房屋云。</p>

<h3>陜省主席祝紹周　對本報記者談陜政</h3>
<p>〔本報西安二月廿八日航訊〕陜西省主席祝紹周氏主持陜政以來，差不了幾天，到三月三日，就恰滿四週年了。省政府的大門正在着手刷白結綵，陜僚屬們到那天慶祝一下。</p>
<p>今天上午，我們如約往謁祝主席，會語的地方在省府大樓，亦即十一年前「西安事變」時蔣委員長吿誡張少帥的地方。祝氏今日的辦公室，當年委員長蒙難，曾在那裏睡過幾天。</p>
<p>這一次訪問，事先我們雖然預備了一些題目，但主人却摸透了記者們心裏要問什麽，因而我們用不着問，他就一氣呵成的說下去，語調脫不了很濃重的江南杭縣口音，而在謙和坦白中帶着自信，堅定。說到困難處，他額前的三道皺紋歷歷在目，到底是五十又半的人，頭髮也有一半轉白了，但紅紅的兩頰結實的肌肉，和矍鑠的眼睛，證明他健康而精力充沛。話題是這樣冒頭的：</p>
<p>安定與財政</p>
<p>我在主陜四年來，每屆週年，一定檢討一下自己的得失，看中心工作到底已經做了多少，沒有做的還有多少。四年中前兩年在抗戰，後兩年在戡亂，我覺得後兩年比前兩年尤爲費力。四年來沒有大建樹，但地方安定，於公於私，兩堪吿　。我一向認爲要在動盪中求安定，艱苦中求進步。而安定又是進步的基本條件。…」</p>
<p>在通貨膨脹和政費緊縮的一般現況下，省級財政困難，當無例外。談到錢的問題，祝主席像一位溫如家長之談家政的道出他的方法：「我有一個原則，就在錢在該用時雖億萬而不稍惜，不該用時雖分毫亦不動用。」說到這裏，他笑了一笑，比一下手勢，才說：「舉一個例吧，今年春節勞軍，我們最初以爲十億就够分發了，可是結果發出廿億，我仍還是咬緊牙關支付了，因爲我以為這是應該的。」</p>
<p>「又比方說，過去省府各廳處的存款，各右門路，利率不一。其後我命令集中存放在省銀行，另一方面請省行提高了對省府存款的利率。目前我們是公款公存，收支公開，利息之應歸公者一律歸公。…」</p>
<p>為鄉土出力　接着，他又談到「人」的間題：</p>
<p>「我們幾年來　　設法提拔當地地方的年靑優秀幹部，設法讓他們能爲鄉土出力，和並不因上級官負之去留而有所變動。我初到任時，省內十個行政專員祗有一個是本省人，其餘九個都是外省人，現在本籍的專員已增加到三位了。再說縣長，在九十多縣中，那時　映籍的縣長僅廿人，而現在有四五十人即全體的半數兌本省籍的了。現在是軍事時期，做縣長的必須懂得軍事，不然的話，任命本省人士做本省縣長的還可增加到十之七八。本來用人就和種樹一樣，祗有當地的樹苗，種在當地的泥土，才易生長。同樣，也祗有地方幹部生了根，一切施政才有基礎。直到現在，我還沒有一個親朋鄕戚在陜省當縣長的。……他一面說，一面在桌上用指頭不斷的寫着「人」字，以强調他對人事，對地方幹部的重視，和大公無私。</p>
<p>滿意的政務　他回答我們說：「陝省的風俗民情很可愛。農民的天眞素樸，刻苦耐勞，尤爲難得。過去我在漢中，時常便服到鄉下和老農們談天，那裏的老鄉，人人都知道我是誰，彼此交談，親如一家人。現在政務比那時忙一些，但我仍希望和關中農民多多談往，四年來如一日。」</p>
<p>「那末，主席四年來對那一方面的政務最爲滿意？」我們問。</p>
<p>「第一是水利，第二是禁政。幾年來假如不是努力禁毒，怕現在的陜西人，不知有多少早已變爲烟鬼了。」</p>
<p>接着，我們談到全省各地的治安，由楡林，延安，關中，陝南而談到四川，湖北的邊境。因爲他除了是省主席以外，身兼全省保安司令兼戒嚴總司令。　可惜當時不巧的有另一位某報記者揷在旁邊，正摘記我們的會談記錄，主人的談話似乎有此顧慮，而我們也不想提出其他預定的問題，這一次訪謁就此結東。　在這裏，我們想附帶摘錄一些本省四年來屬建設方面的統計數字，因爲數字是最客觀的證人。</p>
<p>十條水利渠　先記水利。本省目前共有十條水利渠，幹渠共長八八五公里，灌漑一三四萬畝，受益區棉花增產於去年度有三十五萬市担，四年來統計有一八三萬市担。受益區食糧增產於去年度有二百四十萬市石，四年來總計有一一六五萬市石。上述十渠中，濃惠渠，　惠渠的全部工程，漢惠渠，褒惠渠，湑惠渠，涇惠渠的大部份工程，都是在這最近四年內完成的。除灌漑渠外，刻正分別着手或已經勘測籌劃水力發電工程及蓄水庫之興建，經過四年來不斷探討，已引起全國和當局的注意，加緊逐步實施。最重要的：有（一）黑河蓄水庫，全部已勘測完竣。將來計劃實施完成，可灌田四十萬畝，發電五萬餘匹馬力，輸電週至一百公里。（二）第二渭惠渠已由水利部專案申請工款，即可實施。（三）涇河上游蓄水庫，可灌田百萬畝，已得中央允許。（四）渭河寳鷄峽（太賓谷）蓄水庫，有六萬匹以上馬力，和灌田四十萬畝。（五）禹門口蓄水庫，有三十五萬匹馬力，能灌田二百五十萬畝。</p>
<p>此外尙有小型水利，四年來受益田畝，累計共達二百五十萬畝</p>
<p>農作增產方面：四年來推廣優良麥種，有二百萬市畝，增產了一千八百多萬市担食糧，在同期中還推廣優良棉種有八一八萬市畝，增產了二百五十萬市担棉花。對於本省農村經濟和近年來國內紡織工業，有不可輕視的功勞。（本報記者馬葉·張僊洲）</p>

<h3>美海軍籃球隊抵滬　首戰出師不利　一分敗於青白</h3>
<p>今晚第二戰對</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑島美海軍陸戰隊麥令斯籃球隊應本市籃球委員會之邀請，於昨午搭美海軍機由靑飛抵上海，當晚在市體育館與靑白作第一塲比賽，結果出師不利，以四八比四七半球之差，爲靑白所挫，上半時靑白廿六比三十分落後。比賽經過相當緊張，惟體育館內，球迷並不擁擠。麥令斯今晚第二戰，八時半起，出戰本市盟主華聯，將有一番劇戰。</p>
<p>麥令實力　麥令斯之實力，觀昨晚一戰，並不如何了不得，與靑白在伯仲之間，有若干基本動作甚佳，如籃下投擲，傳球，確有獨到之處，惟嫌生硬不熟，而防衛太疏，亦爲昨晚失敗原因。今晚之戰，恐不敵華聯。該隊以前鋒鄧伯後衛勞特倍克爲最佳，時有精彩表演。昨晚比賽，雖並不如何快速，然乾淨淸爽，無拖泥帶一水，亦頗痛快。</p>
<p>昨賽經過　比賽經過，後半局殊爲緊張，採四節制，第一節靑白四比一佔先，美軍追成十五比十四差一分，第二局二度平手，競爭殊烈，美軍漸漸超出，上半時卒以三十比二十六佔先。下半時麥令斯一路居前惟相差不遠，靑白力追，第三節卅六比卅五，靑白僅少一分。最後決勝一節，緊張萬分，互以一分上下，最後二分鐘時南珍鵠中，四四比四三，靑白多一分，不料被美軍罰中，阿蔡妙中，靑白再度領前，時間餘十二秒勞特倍克罰中一分，麥令斯仍差一分敗北。</p>
<p>第二戰對華聯　美軍麥令斯隊今晚第二仗，八時半起仍在體育館與本市盟主華聯會師，門票樓上三萬，樓下六萬，場內對號座十萬元，對號座上午十時在體育館會計室開始預售，普通座下午五時開始發賣，因羽球比賽關係，大門七時半開放，對號八時入鐵絲網，屆時仍由四維童子軍到塲維持秩序，栽判金伯陶。</p>

<h3>到貨驟增門售轉懈　食米麺粉價續挫　產地報跌白粳再降十餘萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨因物價全面挫落，各產區亦報下游，且計口授糧工作業已實施，人心安定，因之店胃平淡，各檔價格仍趨利勢，較上日又小十餘萬元。</p>
<p>昨南市登記到貨三九四七石，北市六五五一石。市塲做價特高粳南市二八〇萬，北市二七五萬。白敉南市二七〇萬，北市二六三萬。薄稻南市二七〇萬，北市二六五萬，早稻南市二六〇萬，北市二五五萬。羊秈南市二六五萬，北市二六二萬。碾秈南市二五五萬，北市二五〇萬。白元南市二七五萬，北市二七〇萬。</p>
<p>又訊：昨米市繼續傾跌，原因有三：（三）楡林區等配米證業已賣出，米店承銷戶口米後，門市去化轉懈；（二）元宵已過，鄉人開始其春耕工作，値此高價，鄉人紛紛出售，以換取其他需要之物品，故到貨見湧；（三）無錫價格再見低下；凡此種種，足使米市下跌。</p>
<p>麺粉　先跌後升，終仍軋低。晨開因米價之續跌，人心仍不安定，執主誠恐再小，求售甚切，而進戶尙觀望不前。老車粉初開祗一百十四萬五千元，旋銀根稍鬆，北客稍有納取，貨主乘機扣緊，價乃緩緩提高。最後老車爲一百二十萬元。麩皮初小後升，與上日相仿。公配小麥價一百八十九萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧　早降午堅，黃豆產地報價並不回小，已成倒掛之像，而在惡劣環境之下，不易振作，同業銀根緊迫者，只得忍痛割售。苞米北帮久動思靜，啓東苞米再小十萬元。芝蔴津帮云動，本街不吸，九江奶蔴，較昨　跌去一成半。生仁小二十五萬元，紅糧約小十萬元。</p>
<p>食油　初市續降，後市節節高升，最後豆油價反高於上日，市塲投機及踢皮球交易殊多，故成交興吒。早市廠方開出豆油，大有餘以五百三十五萬開出六七百擔，其他廠豆油開出均多，後市散戶拉吸，回籠交易步步做高。最後大有豆油高至五百七十五萬元，軋升十五萬，豆餅跟油市初小二三萬，後市回升，與上日彷彿。</p>
<h3>紡建配價仍高昻　棉紗布漲風再起　四二支藍風囘升一千六百萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因隔日跌勢過烈，引起本街及客帮乘低價吸納，紗商亦有活動，空方獲利抵補，各紗重見上揚。四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開價爲一億零六百萬元有人吸進，嗣後步高至一億一千、八百萬元收盤，較之上日回漲一千六百萬元。又寳光及金城細紗亦回升一千六，八百萬。四十支紗以實用廠進意濃厚，藍鳳重叩一億大關，軋升一千三百萬。二十一支現雙馬，廣帮吸納甚强，檯面帮拉提亦勁，創七千四百萬元之新高峰，猛竄九百萬之鉅。此外廿支十六支十支等粗紗，亦均回秀一成之譜。　昨日棉布市况，又逢紡建公司配售之期，以配價仍高，且銀根轉鬆，漢口帮乘低力進，北帮及廣東帮亦有吸納，浮空抵補股切，市面中途徘徊，臨收堅挺。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布初開二百五十五萬元，一度高至五十九萬，嗣後回降至五十三萬。最後因長江帮吸胃甚强，卒爲二百五十四萬五千元。各細布收價，較之上日回升十餘萬元，其餘嗶嘰直貢漂布等，亦均轉秀，惟色布及士林布平疲。</p>
<p>紡建售紗　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司，昨代紗管會在紗業公會開紗十種，結果准購三〇六件，合廿支紗五百件，准購者共一一四戶。各支紗開價，廿一支金雙馬六八〇〇萬元，廿支大飛艇，公字六六〇〇萬元，雙喜·五子·醒獅·鐘星·六五〇〇萬元，金虎六四五〇萬元。紅蜂·紅飛鴻·六三五〇萬元。</p>
<h3>美棉價低</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據棉業界權威人士談稱：紗管會委託中紡公司在各地收購國棉，成績已趨良好，而美棉可能大量輸入，原棉供應絕對無缺。又美棉以美國物價普跌，棉價减低，而品質優異，各紗廠紡二十支以上紗，大多採）用美棉，故美棉之大量轍入，頗有助於紡織事業之發展云。</p>
<h3>蠶絲產銷會決定　收購生絲結賬期</h3>
<p>蠶絲產銷協導委員會第卅七次委員會，已於昨日（三月二日）假該曾會議室舉行。計到有委員王紫霜·王伯天·刁民仁·何墨林·葛敬中。等十餘人，由主任委員譚熙鴻氏主席。</p>

<h3>人絲上揚　貨向榮</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上揚，一二〇號旭字及金三馬有光，上午開盤甚平，在三千四百萬元左右，旋因各方頗有納胃，以致行情節節上升，午收高至四千二百萬元，午後即漲至五百萬元，最後又升至七百萬元賣出價，結果較上日漲起一千五百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市上午尙平穩，下午微昂，交易極寂，上午高零担成交價五千七百萬元，下午做六千禽及六千二百萬元，其他各級廠絲及千經喊價，均比上日大起四五百萬元之譜，惟俱乏成交。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市向榮，華强真絲被面，開市即高至五百萬元關內，臨近收市時，復呈振奮，迄收市做開六百二十萬元。大誠格子　　先做廿七萬五千元。降至二千元，收市再升至六千元。其餘各貨，均呈堅穩，間有提升者，總不若被面漲勢之銳。</p>
<h3>國外存款準購物資　輸管決定原則</h3>
<p>自備外匯，准購生產器材，轍管會正計劃中。頃悉：此項原則業已決定，祇研究如何實施問題。據輸管會負責人談：此項自備外匯，係限於美私人存款，及僑匯，我目前物資缺乏，需要大批進口，以適應需要。在外匯來源枯渴之情形下，不能不另謀辦法。國外私人存款，大可利用，解決國內物資問題，但此項存款，必須事先移存中央銀行。</p>
<h3>統債少變化　外股又上漲</h3>
<p>公債昨呆滯少變，統丙晨開八萬八，自　萬二退至八萬七，而後稍平。五五二室實進，五五五室則出，較前　計甲乙戊各升一千元，丙種漲二千元，工種獨挫一千元，成交不過二百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨漲風臨收更激，牌價之揣測較股，怡紗自晨開一一三萬起，步昂至一二六萬高價，而後略盤。洋商及證券帮買進，散戶則出，航業仍屬衆矢之的，繼續俏利。結果較前政計紙版鋼業電話升半成，怡紗英聯會　　業　怡　電車升一成，航業獨昂二成。</p>
<h3>華股買風大　永紗創新高價</h3>
<p>產及中絲美亞中法火柴中泥商務閘北咸達漲限。</p>
<p>晨開尙穩，開出見秀少許，永紗現遞均以一〇三〇元登塲，開後外匯未更，七一號等出即交，一一號等出遞交，即吿不支。二一九號等亦供，乃跌至一〇〇〇元及一〇一五元低價。一九七號等進遞交，八九號等進即交，而回升至一〇三五元及一〇四八元。一四六號等脫手後，塲外息價仍須二角四分及二角八分半，銀根見緊，退至一〇一〇元及一〇二五元。一五四號等來買，一八五號等進遞交，升爲一〇二三元及一〇四二元，塲外復有査帳査電話之舉，一四二號等了結即交，七九號出遞交，永紗回跌至一〇〇五元及一〇三〇元。後聞港電微縮，七六號等進　交。一八三號等奮購即交，外股亦起回風，近午漲到一〇七〇元及一〇九五元高價。午刻餘股亦均重振，中絲美亞閘北三小熱所升更多。永紗午收爲一〇六五元及一〇九〇元，較前收回交股計中絲聯華永業漲停，中泥泥升一成。美亞閘北新光勤興中法內衣新華漲半成，國貨恒豐微降，商務麗安尙平，餘均微升。　交股新光景福永紗美亞漲半成，餘升少少許</p>

<h3>茶市迂迥挺秀</h3>
<p>茶市洋莊交易，在陰霾多日中，昨又微露曙光。永興，同孚等洋行，對於卅六年度路莊大帮各有吸進。價格方面，因持者扳售，遂猶迂迴帶挺。至於內銷茶，本街與蘇錫一帶之去化，依然魚貫，故買氣怒茁不戢。但行市雖未顯著晋級，然咸　堅秀，預測前途，續有躍躍欲升之望。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕三區製藥工業，本市新藥及進出口商業等三公會，爲請當局增加重要藥品輸入限額事，昨特聯合招待本市新開界，要求予以輿論上之支援。該會瀝陳理由七點：呈請行政院·全經會·衛生部·聯勤總部·及輸管會等，要求對五六兩季重要藥品轍入，每季仍保持美金六十萬元之數額，以維民族健康，舒暢軍需，並利國防生產，</p>
<p>據製華公會理事長姚俊之談二該會會員一〇七家，刻全部開工者，僅佔三分之一，半開工者三分之一，尙餘三分之一，則已全部停工。近傳美貸五億七千禽元中，西華佔五百萬元。惟根據過去經驗，該項藥品：（一）僅限於極普通之藥品，（二）大多偏向於政府所需者，（三）對民衆未必適用。故對今後西藥之輸入，主張：（一）儘量供給原料，（二）輸入西藥須適合各廠所需云。</p>

<p>— 張道落</p>
<p>二八·鄭家上海公館</p>
<p>門外（卅五年十月）</p>
<p>鄭敬業上海老家福開森路九一八號的門前。一輛汽車載着敬業，秀貞，和他們的行李。（一隻小皮箱，一個布的旅行袋。）開到敬業上海老家的門前。敬業指揮車子停下。自己先下車看看門牌號數。又看看四周。好像還是老樣子。這才不猶豫按電鈴。有一位年約五十歲的婦人來開門。這位婦人是敬業的嫂嫂鄭太太。（鄭太太此刻已有四十七八歲了。）</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（初祇將門打開一小爿。看着往外問。）你是誰？</p>
<p>敬業：這是鄭家嗎？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：是，你找誰？</p>
<p>敬業：（此刻已看淸楚是嫂嫂。）你不是嫂嫂嗎？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（忽然將門大開。）啊！妹妹，是你呀！</p>
<p>敬業：噯！你們都不到飛機塲接我一下。上海的地名改得亂七八糟，我幾乎找不到家了。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：誰知道你今天到呀！</p>
<p>報業：你們沒有接到我的電報嗎？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：沒有呀！快進來吧，行李　用人搬去好了。</p>
<p>敬業：（對嫂嫂笑笑。）我還有一件活行李呢！（嫂嫂莫名其妙敬業走到軍旁，將車門一開。）秀貞下來吧！</p>
<p>（秀貞抱着大衣下車來，看看鄭太太有一點害羞的樣子。大家一同進去。順手關上門。到了客廳裏。）</p>
<p>二九·鄭家客廳</p>
<p>鄭敬業上海老住宅的客廳。佈置相當講究。所用的像眞。有很考究的舊式紅木刻花傢具。也有摩登的沙發椅子之類。牆上掛的都是名書畫家的作品。雖然經過八年戰爭。好像家裏並未受何波動或損失。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：妹妹這是你的的……？</p>
<p>敬業：秀貞，這是我嫂嫂鄭太太，你呌他伯母好了。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（有點開玩笑的說。）我還以爲她應該呌我舅娘呢。</p>
<p>敬業：（帶微笑，含怒的看了嫂嫂一眼。）嫂嫂別胡扯！</p>
<p>這是我在貴陽收養的一個難童。她的父母原來也住在上海。希望在這兒能够找到她的父母，她就有家可歸了。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：啊！妹妹爲什麼勝利一年才回來呢？</p>
<p>敬業：後方有許多人，不知那一年才回來呢！</p>
<p>鄭嫂：妹妹，你一點也沒有變，你比以前更美了。</p>
<p>敬業：你可也沒有老。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：頭髮都雜白了，還沒有老呢！</p>
<p>敬業：吔！我哥哥呢？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：我正要吿訴你，他五月裏到天津去了。</p>
<p>敬業：到天津去幹甚麽？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：有朋友約他去辦理鐵路工程。妹妹累了吧？</p>
<p>你帶秀貞樓上去洗洗臉，休息一會兒。我去預備好茶點，咱們再好好談吧。（上接本刊第十二期本文之前）　三六·鄭家門前</p>
<p>秀貞回家以後的第二天，燦雲和秀貞帶了許多禮物到敬業家來，表示感謝。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：（開門後）啊，秀貞，何太太，是你們呀！請進來吧。（大家一同走入客廳）</p>
<p>三七·鄭家客廳</p>
<p>鄭嫂：何太太，請坐。</p>
<p>燦雲：（將禮物置於桌上，對鄭太太說。）這點微薄東西，是秀貞送給鄭太太和令妹的。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：唉！你們太客氣了。秀貞，你居然送起禮來了！</p>
<p>秀貞：伯母，鄭先生呢？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：他在樓上，不很舒服</p>
<p>秀貞：我去請她下來。（跑上樓去了。）</p>
<p>鄭嫂：何太太，你這個女兒眞是可愛，我妹妹帶了她兩年，自然發生了情感；她回去了。我妹妹自然免不了難受。</p>
<p>燦雲：唉！這眞對不起今妹，我以後常常送秀貞來看她就是了。從昨晚秀貞吿訴我的一切，我也知道今妹的確的愛秀貞，沒有令妹收養她，恐怕這孩子早就沒有了。鄭太太，令妹還沒有結婚嗎？</p>
<p>鄭嫂：沒有。</p>
<p>燦雲：等我來替她介紹，我想她一定可以做一個賢妻良母的。到她自己有了孩子，精神上就有寄託了。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：我這位妹妹和別的女子有些不同，一天到晚只聽見她講學問談事業，却從不聽到她談婚姻的事。</p>
<p>（秀貞拉着着敬業進入客廳。敬業和燦雲招呼。大家坐下以後。）</p>
<p>燦雲：鄭先生，秀貞把您怎樣的救她，怎樣的替她醫傷，怎樣的愛護她，敎育她，都吿訴我了；您這種恩情，是永久無法補報的。（自己先笑笑）</p>
<p>現在我想起昨天要送您酬金，真太可笑了，希望您原諒。</p>
<p>敬業：（一種得意的微笑。）那沒有什麼。</p>
<p>燦雲：秀貞，你來幹甚麽。忘記了嗎？</p>
<p>秀貞：鄭先生，我媽媽要請您和伯母明天到家裏去吃飯。</p>
<p>敬業：何太太，您不必客氣，我明天晚間有事不能去，</p>
<p>燦雲：秀貞的爸爸到香港去了，不然今天是要一同來感謝您，來請您的。您明天有事就改在後天好嗎？</p>
<p>敬業；請您千萬不要客氣，我一向不十分喜歡應酬</p>
<p>秀貞：鄭先生，您說過一定到我家裏去看我的。</p>
<p>鄭嫂：妹妹你就答應了吧！</p>
<p>敬業：（對秀貞笑笑。）就道一次啊！（對燦雲。）好吧，何太太，就是後天晚上吧。</p>
<p>燦雲：您肯賞光，我高興極了。（對鄭太太。）鄭太太，後天您是不能不來的喲。秀貞，我們回去吧。（燦　母女吿別。）何家的客廳。正是晚餐剛元以後，所有的客人一個個由飯廳走入客廳，主人自然是燦雲和秀外。客人則除了鄭敬業鄭太太之貞，還有兩位女客，五位男客，一看就知道是一些摩登人物。大家先後走入客廳以後，有的自己坐了，有的二三人一塊站着說話；何太太注意着照料客人。</p>
<p>燦雲：（對敬業。）鄭先生，請坐吧。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（中）</h3>
<p>— 林野</p>
<p>——一雙流行安南的故事</p>
<p>下船的第二天，老大就尾隨一個採購土貨的同鄉——麻子，遷到旅館裏住。他的身邊有一筆錢，所以願意和那個同鄉合夥，同時他也希望能從他那裏學到一點經驗。誠實的老大，相信別人竟甚於相信自己。</p>
<p>他們休息了幾天，又出發了；這回是要從西貢步行到金邊去辦貨。金邊向以出產胡椒出名，他們希望在那裏買到便宜的胡椒再載運回去。</p>
<p>金邊的地方，雖然沒有西貢大，人口却十分稠密，物產不但豐富同時又是貨物的集散地。居民信奉鬼神，玩弄巫術的伎倆與暹羅並稱，常常可以見到一隊隊穿着古怪裝束的土人，擊着大皮鼓，哼着粗音的歌調，招搖過市，遇着熱鬧的塲所，就用尖長的鐵條，毫不在意地揷入口唇或鼻子上。這種動作嚇慌了老大，但在麻子看來却是司空見慣的。</p>
<p>他們先在街道上瀏覽了一番，同時也探聽胡椒和其他香料的市價。麻子喜歡暍當地的土酒和氣味很濃的檳榔，老大一無所嗜，出入飯館的時候祗要一兩杯咖啡和幾根土烟。日子過得太快，他們過了一星期無意義的生活，老大開始煩厭起來了，他幾乎天天都催着麻子，好敎他快把貨物辦妥回去。麻子也憂戚起來，浪漫無覊的嗜好已把他的資本去了一半，但他又不能立即向老大表示，祗有裝着小心的說：</p>
<p>「貨物的價格太高了，簡直就是欺騙我們外地的商人，再找找罷，等到適合的時候再買。」</p>
<p>一件意外的事情就這樣地發生：有一天，將近黃昏的時候，他們在街上遊蕩？一個身材矮細的中年人跑過來，好像很聰明地說：</p>
<p>「先生，你們是買香料的嗎？我替你介紹，對過那一家特別便宜，他們向來就以老實出名的。」</p>
<p>老大和麻子果然依着他的話照樣去找。」家沒有懸掛招牌的香料店，門舖祗開了一半，裏面陰森森的，看不到半條人影。他們環視了一遍，看見地板上堆積了好幾袋胡椒，還有散落在地下的各色香料；屋頂和牆角結了許多蜘蛛網，顯示出好像很久沒有人打掃一樣。麻子等得不耐煩了，故意咳嗽了幾聲，這時，店裏頭才有幾聲木屐拖動的回響。一個打扮得十分妖美的貴婦細步而出，她毫不客氣地先朝他們兩人的身上打量一番，然後操着不很熟練的唐話（註一）間道：</p>
<p>「你們要買些什麽？」</p>
<p>於是麻子開始和她講起價錢來了，祇有老大默默地站在一傍，欣賞着她的服飾。到安來南前後幾乎要到二個月了，但他從來就沒有留意到當地仕女的裝束，因此他用詫異的目光望着她：她有一束纖細烏黑的頭髮，一直拖到膝部，鬢上揷了幾朶含苟未放的白蘭花，身上穿了一件粉紅色的旗袍，又口一直從脚端開到臀部，那條柔軟的白長褲露了出來。頸子上還有一串發光的珠子，但脚板是赤裸的，祇穿了一對木屐……看起來，的確感覺到別具風光。老大似乎被她迷住了。</p>
<p>商量的結果，麻子滿意了，因爲這裏的價錢的確比市面便宜了三分之一。但是，他們的交易幷不立即成功，她呌麻子隔天午後再來。</p>
<p>老大隨着麻子回來，路上他和麻子提起那個年靑的老闔娘，春心不禁晃盪起來。第二天，老大的確有點不耐等，他沒有等到午後的辰光就獨個兒先去了。</p>
<p>香料店的光綫還是一樣的黯淡，一切的設備和昨天沒有兩樣，老大沒有到達時，艷裝的老闔娘已經守候在店子的門口了，她見到老大劈頭就說：</p>
<p>「我早就猜到您會獨個兒來的，那個麻子眞討厭，否則也免你多跑這一趟！」</p>
<p>後來，他們就很投機地聊起天來，老大把他的經過簡單地講了一些，此時，他已迷醉在她的嬌媚裏了。</p>
<p>原來，這個懂得唐話的姑娘是一個寡婦，五年前死了丈夫之後，一直孤伶伶地生活着；靠着她的丈夫的遺產和賣賣香料度活。生硬而不流利的唐話就是從她的丈夫那裏學來的；因爲他也是一個唐人，。孀居的生活使她感覺到無限的辛酸，她不能繼續浪費她的靑春了。因此她藉着黑暗的掩遮，挪到老大的跟前，跪下來抱住他的腿，一面哭着一面要求與他同居。老大似乎沒有考慮地答應了她。</p>
<p>突發的事情，使麻子流了幾滴過度高興的淚：老大不但不追一討那些與他合股的錢，同時他還從老闆娘那裏得到許多香料。不過，老闆娘提出一個條件，要他回去後保守秘密，不要讓老犬的家人曉得他的住址……</p>
<p>日子過得太快，已經有五個年頭了。沉醉烟酒貪婪錢財的麻子，雖然不斷地來回阪運香料，一但却沒有因此而起家。</p>
<p>老大憔悴了許多，像失去知覺地蟄居於晦暗如前的香料店裏。自從和她同居以後，就沒有離開店舖的窄門，他看不見天，整年整日在臭悶的空氣裏過活。可是，她的容貌和風姿還是一樣的姣好，不過，在老鼠巢般的房子裏她的裝扮顯得很不調和，在晦暗的光綫裏她並不以爲自己的盛裝會失去美麗的功效，相反的，她倒以爲這樣比較更好一些。每天，她把時間化在打扮，蒸烹，睡覺……之上，偶爾也有一兩個顧主上門，但她認爲這是惹人討厭的。房子裏面，有一座佛壇，香燭早晚不息，她大部分的時間就用在唸跪拜。這些，老大從來就沒有過間，他的神智從朱有淸醒的一天。</p>
<p>老二和他的母親還是住在近海的小村落裏，他們日夜盼念着老大的消息，每一艘海船泊岸的時候，他們總抱着一顆熱望的心去探問，但每一次都總着眉頭懊喪地回去。年老的母親把頭髮也等白了，老二靠着粗壯的身體養家，柔順地安慰他的媽媽，同時他暗自許下心願，要遠涉重洋去找他的哥哥。</p>
<p>老二的決心終於實現了，他辛勤工作的結果，錢囊的積蓄已足够維持他的媽媽兩年以上的生活費。</p>
<p>滿頭銀髮的老太婆對於老二，予以更大的希望，她再不作任何更美麗的理想了；祗要他們一家都能够團圓重享天倫之樂，她就心滿意足。</p>
<p>時間過得眞快，老二流落安南打探老大的消息已經半年有多，他踏遍了幾個著名的大城市，跟着販賣貨物的商人沿途訪問，終於來到金邊。辛困的跋涉並不使他灰心，相反地，一分一寸的光陰裏他總覺得有遇見老大的可能。他虔誠地祈禱，求神明的啓示，帮助他把願望實現。每到一處，他就沿着街道陋巷逐戶査問……。誠心與勇氣盈溢之下，他終於猝然地碰見匿跡已久的麻子了。老二耐心地向他査問，狡滑的麻子以爲這是對他有利　機會，所以轉灣抹角地說了一大套曖昧不明的話，結果如願以償地得到相當的報酬才把埋沒了五六年的消息透露出來。</p>

<p>敬業：天下事也眞巧，假若不是我嫂嫂偶然看見報上的啓事，我們也沒有法子知道何太太他們在那裏的。</p>
<p>男甲：這話倒是真的。我天天看報，就沒有看見他們的啓事</p>
<p>（正在道個時候。何琦·何琦此刻已有四十二三歲了。——手裏提着一個小提箱，忽然跑入客廳。）</p>
<p>何琦：哈羅！你們都在這兒！（敬業早已看淸楚何琦，而何琦却還沒有注意到她；敬業即立起來轉過身去，看看牆壁上的畫，何琦也還沒有看到他的女兒。）燦雲，秀貞在那裏？你的電報不是騙我的吧？（此刻秀貞正在客廳一角。男客乙將身體掩住秀貞。秀貞在他後面偸偷看着何琦。）　（未完）</p>

<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>巴爾欽的新作</p>
<p>英國巴爾欽（Nigel　Balchin）是戰時爲人注意的小說家。他在一九〇八年生於尉爾特郡（Wklthire）。曾寫過好幾本小說：「沒有天空」（No　Sky，1933），「簡單的生活」（Simple　Life　1934）。「收入和支出」（Income　and　Outcome，1936），「黑暗從天而降」（DarkNess　Falls　from　theAlr，1942「小小的後房」（The　Small　BackRoom，1943）等。</p>
<p>但最近他却寫了一本戲劇「上帝呵我害怕」（Lord，I　Was　Afraid）。這是一種艱苦的工作。他嘗試着要概括英國整個時代的生活，思想與成功，顯示它怎樣路步到世界上去，並說明它的過程和終結。這是一個較長的劇本，同時也可以說是對於時代的傳記描寫。他具有頭等腦筋，又誠實，又有非常淸晰的觀察。他所寫的時代就是他一九〇八年出世時的時代，他用七個不同的人物來代表。他們從學校裏出來，經過戰爭，反對希特勒。他們具有時代的優點和缺點。</p>
<p>作者用高度的想像力通過寓言的塲景寫這七個人的經驗。這劇本幾乎像是詩歌。人物做了觀念的犧牲，幾乎像是木偶，不像活人，但觀念却非常熱烈而且淸晰，不但像是照在顯微鏡下，還像在燃燒。這劇本還閃耀着「機智」的光輝，帶一點「反諷」的</p>
<p>李德（Henry　Reed）在「一九三九年後的小說」(The　Novel　Since　1939）中曾對於巴爾欽的作品有一點批評。他說戰爭是惡夢，看戰爭小說不過分享惡夢而已，但巴爾欽的小說却不然。他的「黑暗從天而降」和「小小的後房」都是在戰時國民服務處寫的。他有能力控制許多人物，結機緊凑，對話自然。「小小的後房」最爲流行，寫的是科學戰爭硏究室中的硏究員因小事而爭吵，忌妒，結果是失敗，又寫他們想破除德國愚人陷阱的秘密。他寫得緊張，有趣而且動人，可惜不是獨創的，是沒有前途的。但後來他寫「我自己的劊子手」（Mine　own　Executioner，1945）就沒有這種缺點了。他全用對話，說到一個精神分析學者不但面對着病人的困難問題，還無法醫治他自己失敗了的戀愛。</p>
<p>中國文學的英譯</p>
<p>以前我曾介紹過范成大詩的英譯。新近又知道林語堂寫了一本蘇東坡的傳記，名呌「愉快的天才」（TheGay　Genius）。蘇軾比達文西早四百年，比富蘭克林早七百年。這部書使得美國人感到興趣，連最瑣細的描寫都有，例如：蘇東坡打鼾，每天早最梳髮一百次，用鼠　的竹筆作畫，他的朋友與敵人，他與朝讓的戀愛等等。</p>
<p>我們知知道嘉爾思（Giles）譯過「聊齋誌異」（The　Stranges　from　a　Chinese　Stucis）現在又知道孔攻（Rose　Quong）又新譯了「中國思與　的故事」（Chinese　Ghoot　and　Love　Stories）。一向編「世界短篇小說選」的人只知道聊齋是中國短篇小說的代表，但勝利前後中國新文藝介紹過去的較多，新近出版的一部「世界短篇小說選」已經拿魯迅林語堂寫等人作爲中國小說的代表了。自然這裏面還有一點隔膜，因爲林語堂是不大寫短篇小說的，他只偶然用英文寫長篇小說。中文差不多只寫雜文。</p>
<p>英國配尼（Robert　Payne）選譯了一部「現代中國詩」(ConternPorory　Chinese　Poetry），其中有徐志摩，聞一多，何其芳，馮至，卞之琳，臧古家，田間。每一詩人並附略傳。配尼曾在中國住渦許多年。</p>
<p>偶然翻檢—明天的中國」一卷四號，知道拜因（Cranmer　Bying）在東方知懸慧業中出了一本「唐詩三百首」（Three　Hundred　Poemsof　the　Dynaty）。</p>
<p>哇萊（Arthur　Waley）選譯了一本「中國詩」（Chinese　Poems），大部分是他的舊譯，也有一小部分新譯。約從第十世紀到第十七世紀。</p>
<p>配尼又與　家譯（Yuan　ChiaHua）合譯「中國短篇小說」（Chinese　Short　Stories），收有老舍，楊振聲，施蟄存，沈從文，張天翼，端木　良等家　作品。序言中說到他們所受到的西方的影響，又附有各家的傳記，但評者却說，這些作者的作品技巧和感人的力量都很好，他們實有他們自己的特點。</p>

<h3>超山觀梅記</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>民紀三十七年二月舊歷元宵節，胡王諸子相約去杭州看超山梅花。同　八人，當日到杭，先游孤山，作爲這短篇小說的楔子。孤山下下疏疏落落的幾株，還不够鼓勵吾們游興。第二天早上，雇定大汽車一輛，問知杭州到超山有五十公里路，東北行，出杭州市，循着滬杭公路，沿杭州海灣，約三十餘公里，至橋司站，左行，折入杭塘公路，這裏望西直通塘樓，地形由平野漸入「疏山地」（我行內久地，凡諸山離立，而平地多於山地者，我稱爲「疏山地」；若山地多於平地，我稱爲「密山地」）。在距塘樓六華里處（據土人說），就山下停車。山形成兩冀，行不到幾十步，萬梅如海，有白，有紅，有綠，而白的最多，中間老梅一株，短闌圍着，兩幹斜出，其一已枯，一幹分枝高下，花白色，正在盛開，從皮骨上看來，顯出年齡甚高，樹旁木牌標名宋梅，花瓣亦五出，與普通一樣，惟姿態古拙可愛，同游者就其下各攝影。</p>
<p>廣大的梅畦之旁，有亭曰宋梅亭，淸宣統三年秋，周夢坡建，按其時武昌正將起義，山中人殆未之知也。梅畦當報慈寺後身　梅，寺產也。入寺，壁間有林琴南記，康有為詩，皆就宋梅而張大之，我感覺他們都沒有搔着癢處，細問土人，乃知此地諸山，接近塘樓，皆宜果樹。塘棲本以產蔗著名，聞在浙省爲富力最高之區，即以梅論，寺有梅二百株，每株可收梅子五十斤，熟年共收百餘擔，製爲話梅，半梅，風雨梅，入市皆可得高價，此地種果樹，不知始自何年，惟旣爲土性所宜，經歷年代，必已甚久。寺僧更漫指庭中一株爲唐梅，郤爲諸名流宣揚所未及，則所謂宋梅，安知不出若干年前寺僧所漫指。四川三台古唐梅，亦不知其根據，恐與此相類耳。寺佾宏修要我題詩，爲題七古一首。</p>
<p>三台曾觀古唐梅，久識超山今始來。晴空欲眩一片雪，獨幹老矣猶花開。此山宜梅土殊衆，山民資生免飢凍，八九百年一二存，坐令游人思趙宋。唐梅宋梅證已稀，　傳六出形漸非，此花古拙飽桑海，即今山外喧金　聲。</p>
<p>以我推論，土性宜果樹，山民多恃果樹爲生（不止蔗與梅，他果皆宜），此風俗必已傳之甚古。我並不懷疑宋時此地沒有梅花，滅不敢遽信標題宋梅的一株，確是宋朝之物。在寺餐畢，坐轎游乾元觀海雲洞，繞着山自西轉南轉東，沿山坡盡是梅畦，曲折行萬花中，至白茅坡，一客忽大聲喊六瓣梅發見了，果然，不但有六瓣，而且有七瓣八瓣，確是單　，不是重臺。我的鼻子也吿訴我聞得足够了，趁著日未下山歸去。</p>
<p>第三天，吃茶西冷印社四照樓，忽於仰賢亭下，又發見了六瓣梅。</p>
<p>同游者胡厥文，沈方成，王佑本，鄒康，鄭令昱，姚維鈞，黃當時。</p>
<h3>新春射虎</h3>
<p>— 盛俊才</p>
<p>元宵後二日，華燈初上，本埠外灘中國銀行大禮堂，有一別饒與味之集會，主持者爲上海銀錢業同人聯誼會，參加者該會男女會員五六百人。會中節目，除粵樂，話劇，口琴，舞蹈，歌詠等外，另有銀錢報主辦之　　遊戲，最稱特色。事前，由該報邀請製謎老手多人，分製文虎，供會員猜射，並備贈品助興。是日適逢天雨，筆者應約前往，見「虎增」前高懸用紅綠紙長幅書成之跡面數十條，琳琅滿目，美不勝收。筆者巡禮一周，僅猜中兩則：其一曰「紅綠燈」，射三國人名一，謎底爲「管輅」；其二曰「海」，射銀錢業術語一，謎底爲「匯水」。此外，有一謎面爲「全家都在西風裏」，射　名二，筆者鋪「白露」「小寒」，及揭曉則爲「大寒」「小寒」。係以大小兩字，烘托全家。筆者僅從「在西風裏」四字着想，宜其祗中一半也。又有一謎面曰「兩馬相父」，射本市商店名稱一，筆者苦思不得，姑以「馬敦和」試射，（教和作敦倫和好解）孰知謎底「馮了性」。其他各條，亦頗精彩，茲就記憶所及，摘錄數則如次，以供同好：（一）紙墨筆硯（射字一）賣；（二）夜夜不成雙（射銀錢業術語一拆字格多單；（三）或（射行莊名一捲簾格）中國；（四）有了條子沒了良心（射字一）銀；（五）再三謙讓（射三國人名一）陸遜；（六）一人在上十人在下兩個小人左右擁抱（射行莊名稱一）大來；（七）先寫了一撇撇後寫了一劃（射字一）孕；（八）擯夫婿於門外（射地名一）娘子關；（九）模範村（射地名一）良鄕；（十）好說好話（射字一）誰；（十一）寳靑春（射宋詞二句）莫敵閒白了少年頭；（十二）若要工夫深鐵杵磨成針（射行莊名一）恒利。</p>
<h3>道地的作家</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>美國某小說家，所以寫作態度鄭重道地著稱，他描寫任何情節，必先躬親實驗，而后動筆。有一次因爲要描寫飢餓臨死時的感覺，乃效法甘地，絕食數天，幾乎餓死。一天，他忽然苦思終日，坐立不安，結果舉槍自殺。他的妻子檢視他未完成的遺著，發現最後一段這麽寫着：「皇帝剛才下車，突然，有一顆槍彈穿過他的頭顱。」</p>
<h3>「學店」？「學殿」？</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>今人多以學校爲學店，以爲學校當局只知收學費飽私囊，行爲頗似不道德的商人，所以名曰學店，而以校長為學店老闆，以學校爲販賣知識的塲所，而非敎育靑年的機關。這在大都市中有許多學校，不免有「將本求利」，或「咍誤靑年」的不良行爲，被各曰店，似乎咎由自取。</p>
<p>現在的商業有私營省營國營之別，學店亦不能例外，所以也有私立，省立（市立）和國立的區別。不過一般人名學校爲學店，目的完全在諷刺及譴責學校當局，據我的看法，如果我們的學校果眞都變成貨真價實的學店，成績到也不壞。現在情形的嚴重，現象的悲觀，還不在學校之爲「學店」，而在學校之爲「學殿」！</p>
<p>如說學校是學店，校長是老闔，那麼敎職員是夥友，知識是貨品，顧客是甚麼人？自然是學生了。一般的商業情形，顧主總想討便宜，多買一點，絕沒有拿了錢不買東西的，也沒有肯多拿錢少買東西的。學生要是顧客的話，便應該要想少繳學費，多要知識，不應該只繳學費，不要知職，或多繳學費，少要知識。學生要有小菜塲買菜的勇氣，稱好了再拉一把。要有布店買布的勇氣，量好了再放半尺。貨色不合，要掉換，貨色不足，要增添。我想學生要眞是像顧客那樣爭先恐後，或爭多量少，對於知繳一點不放鬆，一點不肯吃虧，那麼學校就是「學店」，「交易而退，各得其所」，也未始不是一樁很合理的辦法。</p>
<p>可惜現在學校雖係學店，而學生却不是顧客。家長千　萬舌，替他或她們繳了學費，這些少爺小姐們却不肯用功讀書，有許多人，不但不曉得貨色的好壞，而且往往拿着劣貨當寳貝，甚而至於根本不要甚麼貨色，先生强迫他們要一點，他們還十分討厭。聽見學校放假，或先生請假，沒有不全班歡呼的。他們絕沒有想到放假請假，在學生是一種損失。不特此也，他還自動的請假，上課時間說話，看小說，寫情書，打派　，甚而至於罷課。試想世上竟有只出錢而不肯要貨色的顧客，豈不是大笑話—豈不是大傻瓜？於今這種笑話，這種　瓜，眞是俯拾即是，遍地都有。這比鏡花緣上君子國的君子要高到若干倍。</p>
<p>一般人視學校為學店，我認爲學生却視學校爲學殿。殿是一座廟裏最莊嚴偉大的地方。校長是方丈，職員是普通的和尙，敎員是會念經的和尙。學生是香　。香客背着「朝山進香」的書包，把大把的香錢，塞到「萬善同歸」的錢柜裏，聽和尙們「念念有詞」，有的還想討一根諸事大吉的上上籤，有的就在佛殿裏瞎玩一陣，看看泥塑的菩薩，聞聞香燭的氣味，一無所得的空手回去了。繳學費算是布施，註册好似上緣簿，繳雜費好似燒香燭，聽念經好像上課，上上籤或中下籤便是成績報吿單，除此以外，甚麽都沒有了。小的時候在小廟裏玩，大了在大廟裏玩，錢多的還可以到外國的敎堂裏去玩。燒香的惟一志願是希望菩薩保佑，將來大大的有好處，入學校的惟一志願是希望有了文憑可以大大的有好處。旣然希望將來有好處，所以現在就非慷慨的布施不可。也許現在愈慷慨，將來的希望就愈大。「如欲取之，必姑予之」，眼前又何必那麽斤斤計較，自然更不能學「錙銖必較」的商業行爲了。</p>
<p>我是學店裏三十年以上的老夥友，你說我看着只拿錢而不要貨色的顧客還是應該喜歡呢？還是應該悲哀呢？我還是固守崗位，硬要把貨色送給不願意要貨色的顧客呢？還是聰明一點，學學「念念有詞」的和尙，來一個「四大皆空」，使「三千弟子」「皆大歡喜」呢？</p>
<h3>用筆雜談</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>褚河南問虞永興曰：「吾書比之歐陽詢如何？」永興曰：「詢用筆不論好壞，皆能得心應手，君似不能。」鮮干伯機書送李愿歸盤谷序後有云：「旅次無佳筆，殊以為苦，雖勉强竟書，已三易其筆矣。」（大意如此）可見書家之於用筆，亦猶武士之用兵器，善於刀者未必善於槍也。衛夫人筆陣圖記中有云：「筆要取祟山絕仭中兎毛，八九月收之，其筆頭長一寸，管長五寸，以鋒齊腰健爲佳。」蘇東坡以黃連湯調靑粉蘸筆，候乾收之。黃山谷以川椒前湯磨松烟染筆藏之。趙松雪遇筆有宛轉如意者，輒剖之，取其精毫，別貯之，萃三管之精，令工總縛一管，則眞草巨細無不可。劉石庵則破新筆，自揀精毫，重加純束，不付之工人也。古人之於用筆，愼重如此。</p>
<p>宋時有鷄心筆，小兒胎髮筆，猩猩毛筆，鼠尾筆，狼毫筆，淸時更有貂毫筆。明季陳白沙先生取蘆葦爲之，名曰茅龍筆，今廣東會城捷元齋所造者，甚負盛名，余於馬公愚先生處偶一書之，頗覺宛轉如意。</p>
<h3>關於林大飲</h3>
<p>— 雪耘</p>
<p>讀二月二十四日自由談，鄭過宜君所紀林大欽昧於史蹟一文，以林作重修寳雲巖記，誤用牛李事，其實不然，因鄭君所見非原作也。按林大欽字敬夫，潮洲海陽人（即今潮安），明嘉靖辛卯解元，壬辰狀元，授修撰，時年二十，猶未娶也。迨分官勢張，　然引去，與王龍溪羅念庵以理學相切劑，其高風亮節，照耀嶺東，有東莆先生集行世。（阮芸臺廣東通志有傳）今所傳重修寳雲巖記有二篇，皆云作於壬寅歲，其用牛李事之一篇，凡六百餘字。考東莆集別有重修寳雲巖記一篇，祗四百餘字，未涉牛李事，末云：「余異日解綬歸里，獲與諸同人朝夕潛息其間，以忘老焉，斯亦余似續妣祖之一事也。」此可斷爲先生未歸隱時作，至鄭君所見一篇，則後人僞託，刊者誤入，蓋未有同時作至二篇者也。　集中　策，有牛李之黨一文，歷舉漢宋史事以論牛李，且云：「卒使朝廷大權，旁落於閹寺，篡殺之禍，繼筆於簡書。」其於明室閹禍，若見先幾，如是尙有不知牛李之事者乎？鄭君生長滬上，宜其不見全豹也。（却酬）</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>一個親戚生了肺癆，雖然肺癆病到目前爲止，還沒有特效藥可以一針見效或是三天包好，但是並不一定無法可救，只要療治得宜，營養和環境心情都留意，一年半載，是不難重復健康的。我那位親戚家中雖非富裕，但總可以過得去，可惜是他太缺乏科學醫藥常識，沒有決斷力，所以因循延誤，諱疾忌醫，病况便一天比一天討厭起來。這樣下去恐怕糟得很，我曾經不止一次這樣想，並且還婉轉地這樣對他說過，只是他一聽到有誰提起他的病，心中就難過不快活，所以我就也不敢多說，况且彼此間的親戚關係也並不十分密切，難得碰見，見到了祇是相互寒喧幾名，也就算了。</p>
<p>他自己明白自己巳經忠有肺病，可是他雖然時常去請敎醫生，而當醫生對他說要如何如何，例如回鄉，開肋骨，打針，人工氣胸等的時候，却似乎又不相信自己眞的會有肺病，而對愛克司光照像開始懷疑起來。肺病而起的症象本有許許多多，時而咳嗽，時而頭痛，時而腰脚無力，時而發熱盜汗，時而胃納不佳，他雖然不聽從醫生的長期休息的忠吿，但每逢身體不舒服，却又去麻煩醫生。咳嗽了，便喜歡吃些止咳露之類、，頭痛了，任意呑些阿司匹靈，可是吃了止咳露之後，咳嗽比較好些，頭却又痛起來，吞了幾片阿司匹靈，頭似乎不痛了，而腰脚又覺得酸軟乏力，如此循環不已。每次我到他家裏去，牀邊藥瓶藥罐堆滿，而病仍舊不見起色，不但不見起色，反而愈加沉重起來。</p>
<p>曾經有過這樣一個經驗，我的一隻小小的舊藏書木箱的蓋子壞了，便自己拿了一柄鎚子幾枚釘子修一修。看看彷彿容　得很，釘釘牢就沒有事，可是第一隻角釘牢了，另一隻角翹起，等問我把另一隻角釘牢時，而第一只角又彈了上來，此起彼伏，小小一件事，弄得我疲於奔命，原來這塊蓋子受了水浸，所以木頭凹凸不平。最後還是請敎木匠，重配一塊了事。</p>
<p>有人說目前的敎育制度如何敗壞，有人說目前的官塲情形如何卑鄙，有人說目前經濟狀况如何危險，有人說目前人心如何惡劣……並且有人提出怎樣改革敎育的具體主張，怎樣澄淸吏治的基本方法，怎樣整理經濟的完善建議，怎樣挽回風氣的皇　論文；但是這些只是咳嗽頭痛，腰脚無力，發熱盜汗，胃納不佳之類的症象；用的也只是止咳露阿司匹靈之類的成藥。醫了那，治不了這；而治了這，又醫不了那。事實上，連逍和那都不能斷根，不過是稍爲緩和一些病勢而已。</p>
<p>最近又聽說我那位親戚因爲「傷風」頭痛發熱而在牀上了，看上去「傷風」是過了一星期半個月會好的，但是他的健康決不能恢復，因爲他不能正本淸源地從底做起。假使是肯從底做起的話，肺病雖已到了第二期，却還未始沒有挽回的希望，並沒有到「回天乏術」「不可救藥」的地步。方法有是有的，並且還很普通平常，而患病的本人也許自已也知道，所以可怕的不是「疾」，而是「諱」疾，缺少的不是「藥」，而是沒有服藥的「心」。這可就呌第一等的名醫也不能不爲之束手了。</p>
<h3>稱慶</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>前次朋友送來一包紅蛋，並約定昨天去吃彌月酒，爲了慶賀朋友孩子的新生，兼爲一修口福起見，照例去大嚼一頓。因此想起時不論古今，地無分中外，對於「生」之一事，看得極重，人生自呱呱墮地起，彌月便要稱慶，自後週歲，十歲，二十歲，二十九歲，三十歲……（餘類推）一定要慶祝一番，有的人甚至每年做壽，雖小生日亦必大排塲；有的人常年發「鄙人三十大慶」紅封帖子，利用其徒衆多，　儀滾滾而來，帶有營業性質。雖然有人　後者爲秋風帖子，但在另一方面看來，足徵此人重視其「生」。歲月悠悠，人壽幾何？逝去的生命旣無　迫回，何妨慶祝一下，而且倒底要張羅一筆酒席費用，不能純粹說是打秋風，若是說逐什一之一利，有如營業，其亦得忠恕之道乎？</p>
<p>日前　載某君主張：「六十以下不稱慶」，至堪欽佩。人生百年耳，六十以下，年年發一次帖子，一生亦不過六十次，以有限之歲月，尋少數之慶祝，其事至堪悲；何况六十以下有力量稱慶者，全中國四億五千萬人中能有　人能夠辦得到？至於有力量　慶的人，即有某君的大聲疾呼，我敢保證他們還是視若無睹，關起大門來　熱鬧一番的，是則某君的呼籲，完全有「知其不可爲而爲之」的精神，我之欽似無已，諒必爲讀者所首肯！</p>
<p>佛家以生老病死為衆生四大難，而以「生」居其首，因爲老病死三者是有了「生」之後才來的，所謂不生即不滅是也。換句今日的術語，即是「人生祗有一次」，人類應尊重其「生」，世俗相沿之所以要慶祝其誕辰，應該是寓有珍惜的意味，連珍惜都不能，乃是鄙人上文所說的「其事至堪悲」的註脚。試聽今日的電台中流行着「上壽」開筆或Happy　Birthday　to　you，雖然聽得人家的耳朶生繭，或是掛斷電台電話，或是在電話裏大　山門，結果仍有人點唱，仍有人歡喜聽，　非人人重視其生命，對於各自的誕辰，有一種嚮往　依　而已。</p>
<p>今日的名流大都有愛惜羽毛的潔　，大塲面種慶，必定捐款助學，賑濟難民，國家旣不能拯救窮　，藉名流之稱慶而惠及孤寒，豈非一舉數得之事？至於小人的生日，吃幾條壽麺即算，本來要吃飯的，　轉代之，諒與節約　關，且亦無干禁例，故我若爲上文所說的某君，必曰：六十以下可以稱慶！</p>
<h3>怪押欵</h3>
<p>— 無咎</p>
<p>我們總以爲銀行務的性質比較　　，可是竟也頗有怪事發生。據美利堅銀行消息，該行最近曾先後接到過三批做押款的申請，而抵押品却是：（一）　乾了的蒼蠅一車；（二）馬尾巴一船；（三）用過的假牙鹵一批。據中請人說，　蒼蠅係供鳥食；馬尾巴上的毛却是槍砲瞄準器上用　着的。可充瞄準器上那些交叉的細綫之用。但是，那些　的似牙齒有什麽用處呢？却實在誰都想不出來！</p>
<p>結果三筆押款都沒有做成功，銀行方面的答　是「抵押品銷場欠廣」，因之不能答應云。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十一章　滿復疑雲（八六）</p>
<p>小王媽道：「老板已把徐先生氣走，還哭什麽呢！」綺紈哭了一陣，才抬起頭來，問道：「徐先生走了，說什麽話沒有？」小王媽道：「沒說什麽，我請他明天來，他也沒答應。」綺紈聰了，伏在床上又哭。小王媽道：「老板！你心裏有什麽委曲，何不直捷痛快吿訴徐先生，免得你兩人發生誤會？事情只要一說，彼此都明白了。」綺紈搖搖頭道：「你不知道，我那能吿訴徐先生！由他生氣好了，我正要他生氣！」小王媽道：「老板，你和徐先生，不是很要好馬？爲會麼又這樣過不去？我看……」小王媽正說到這裏，只聽外面一陣門鈴響動，聲音非常急促。綺紈道：「王媽，你不用說了，快出去看看，是什麽人。「小王媽趕到樓下，喘着氣又跑上樓來，報吿道：「繆處長來了。」綺紈發急道：「我這樣十披頭亂髮，似鬼一般，那能見得他！王媽你快出去，請他先在客廳坐一會，我就來。」綺紈一面打發小王媽出去，一面急急觀身下床，先把房門鎖上，走到梳妝台前，忙忙擦一把臉，剛把頭髮理好，正要重施脂粉，只聽房門已打得鼕鼕的響，十分急促，料想一定是忠傑在外面敲門，忙不迭地用粉撲在臉上撲了兩下，將睡衣扯一扯，對鏡一照，才走過去，把房門開了。忠傑早一頭擠進來，舉日先向四下一望，好似要找什麼人，然後定睛對綺紈釘了一眼，冷冷一笑道：「光天化日，還要關着房門睡覺，難道還怕有强次進來嗎？」綺紈見他說話毫不客氣，滿臉露着不願意的神色，若是在平時，憑她倔强脾氣，　三言兩語，把他驅逐門外，因爲現在要利用他，不能不曲意奉承，先在他闊肩上，拍了一下，媚笑道：「不錯，我是怕强盜，怕你這强盜闖進來！」忠傑把臉一沉道：「我不和你開玩笑，我有話要問你！」說着，竟把綺紈推開。</p>

<h3>The Situation Along the Beining Railway Line Gradually Clarifies, Traffic Between Shenyang and Xinmin Reopens, Public Morale Steadily Improves, and Bandits Who Slipped into Laosiping Are Repelled</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qianyang by this Newspaper, 2nd] News of aid to China arrives frequently, and public morale is steadily improving. The Panjin section of the Beining Railway Line is gradually clearing up, and civilians are already traveling back and forth on foot. The railway between Dashiling River and Shishan has been repaired, and traffic between Panjin and Xinmin reopened on the 2nd. The garrison troops in Xinmin have redeployed and successively recovered Chazao'an and the train station. Fighting continues in the northern suburbs of Xinmin. It is reported that the National Army, after recovering Dahushan, also recovered Heishan on the same day, but this has not yet been fully confirmed. The Battle of Siping may begin within two or three days. The 6th and 7th Columns of bandits continued to advance towards Siping from Tongjiangkou on the 1st. A portion of the 2nd and 3rd Columns of bandits are also advancing north from Faku. One column is in Changwei, south of Siping, and the 10th Column has reached Yehe, east of Siping. After the tension in Liaobei, the bandits also threatened to attack Jilin and Changchun. Although the Han Chinese side is slightly nervous, there are no large groups of bandits approaching the border around Zhoujing.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping by this Newspaper, 2nd] Military operations in North China and Northeast China are intertwined. Ensuring western Liaoning as a bridgehead to recover the Northeast and protect North China has become an important military issue. Since Luo Zhuoying arrived in Beiping with Wei Lihuang's orders, he has been in frequent contact with North China generals. On the morning of the 2nd, he visited Fu Zuoyi in the western suburbs, and in the afternoon, he visited Chu Xichun. Hou Jingru, the commander of the Tianjin garrison, also came to Beiping on the 1st.

<h3>Northeast Petition Delegation Arrives in Nanjing, Stating That Increased Support and Currency Reform Are Most Urgent, Date for Audience with Chairman Jiang Awaits Scheduling</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 2nd] Wang Huayi, Zhang Baozi, Li Zhonghua, and Tian Yushi, representatives of the Northeast People's Petition Delegation, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd. Mo Dehui and others welcomed them at the station. Wang and others then went to the official residence of President Yu Youren to present the current situation in the Northeast, which lasted for more than two hours. They emerged at eleven o'clock and then visited Liu Zhe, a fellow Northeasterner living in Nanjing. At half-past twelve, they attended a luncheon hosted by Mo Dehui and Yu Bin, with Zhang Zuoxiang and Wan Fulin also in attendance. In the afternoon at three o'clock, Wang and others visited Minister Chen Lifu. Wang Huayi and Li Zhonghua also requested to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting to be held on the 3rd to report on the purpose of their petition and the various crises in the Northeast. The date for an audience with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has yet to be scheduled. Wang Huayi told reporters in the evening: "There are two most important issues currently facing the Northeast: one is the issue of increased support, and the other is the issue of currency reform." According to Wang, "We hope that the Central Government's support for the Northeast will come as soon as possible, the more the better. We must seize the time to be effective." Secondly, regarding the issue of Northeast circulating currency, Wang and others believe that Zhang Jia'ao cannot shirk his responsibility. He failed to rectify it in the past, and it is even more serious now. Currently, the amount of circulating currency issued each month reaches 180 billion, and the total amount has reached 5 trillion yuan. In the small number of areas that the National Army can control, there is such a huge amount of paper money. How can the people not suffer? Regarding the above two issues, Wang and others will go to the Executive Yuan on the 3rd to meet with President Zhang Qun, submit written opinions, and conduct thorough discussions with Chief Secretary Gan and others to find a proper solution. In particular, they hope to meet with Zhang Jia'ao within days to discuss good strategies. Regarding the food issue, Wang believes that it is extremely difficult to transport food before the Beining Railway is opened. However, Jinzhou can be used as a concentration point first, and then airlifted from Jinzhou. It is also learned that after Wang and others arrived in Nanjing, they reached a consensus with Zhang Zuoxiang and other Northeast officials, as well as Northeast residents in Nanjing such as Mo Dehui and Yu Bin, on ways to save the crisis in the Northeast.</p>

<h3>US Congress Invites MacArthur and Chennault to Provide Opinions on Aid to China, Telegraphs Chen to Return to Washington Within the Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 1st] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today invited General MacArthur and General Chennault to personally or in writing present their opinions on the aid to China bill to the committee. The House Foreign Affairs Committee asked General MacArthur to present his opinions on the proposal to aid China and other important areas in the Far East. The Foreign Affairs Committee also asked General MacArthur to specifically present his opinions on the following two points: (1) The importance of maintaining a free, independent, friendly China for world peace and the United States' position and interests in the Western Pacific; (2) What economic or other measures should be taken to accomplish this goal. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also asked Chennault to provide similar opinions and instructed him to return to the United States within a week or ten days, if possible.</p>
<p>[This City News] General Chennault received two urgent telegrams from the US Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee on the morning of the 2nd, urging him to return to the United States as soon as possible to report on the general situation in China and his opinions on the current situation to the Washington authorities. Chen has not yet made any statement. The telegram also stated that it hopes Chen will arrive in Washington within a week. The US believes that Chen has been in China for many years and has made great contributions during the war, so he has a clear observation of the current situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from Washington, 1st] Well-informed sources say that if MacArthur agrees to the request of the House Foreign Relations Committee to submit his opinion on aid to China, it is expected that MacArthur will request effective US military assistance to the Chinese government. They said that MacArthur's invitation to the committee was prompted by those who advocated giving the Republic of China much more aid. MacArthur will support their demands for direct military assistance to the Chinese regime. Official reports stated that Commander MacArthur agrees to provide China with appropriate military assistance to suppress the Communist Party. MacArthur believes that the China problem is fundamentally a military problem and that economic means without military assistance to China are useless.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Vice President Fang En Telegram from Tokyo, 2nd] Generally speaking, MacArthur believes that the situation in China is quite serious. MacArthur informally stated in mid-December that, in terms of the interests of the United States, he felt that the China problem was mainly a military one. The United States should immediately provide the National Government with a large amount of military assistance to prevent the Northeast, North China, or Korea from falling into the Soviet orbit. Military experts in the United States in Tokyo have long felt that if the United States decides to provide China with a large amount of military assistance, it will not be a major problem to suppress the Chinese Communist army. They pointed out that the US military under MacArthur's command in the Western Pacific currently has sufficient ammunition, air force, and other supplies to equip at least fifteen divisions of the National Army.</p>

<h3>Bullitt Urges to Purchase Munitions for $100 million to Aid China</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York 2nd Broadcast: Washington News, former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt, today attended the House Foreign Affairs Committee to testify, urging Congress to quickly take action on the China Aid Plan, advocating that in addition to the government's proposed $570 million in economic aid to China, $100 million be supplied to purchase munitions for the use of the Chinese government. Bullitt said: "The American taxpayers can pay a considerable amount of money to temporarily let the Japanese live and maintain a large number of troops in Japan to prevent the rise of communism, but this method cannot last long. China is the key to the Far East and must not be ignored. Since the summer of 1946, except for the small amount of munitions left in China by the US Navy and Marines, the Chinese army has not received a single bullet from the United States. After the efforts of　會,Half of the munitions are now on their way. On the other hand, since the Soviet Union occupied Manchuria, it has supplied the Chinese Communist Party with weapons seized from the Japanese and new munitions manufactured in Korea and Siberia from Japanese machinery transported from Manchuria. We refuse to give munitions to our friends, but the Soviet Union is arming our enemies on a large scale."</p>
<p>Foreign Committee Republican member Voris asked Bullitt whether he had evidence that the Soviet Union was arming the Chinese Communist Party? It is said that the CCP has nothing to do with Moscow. Bullitt replied that China's past history is the best evidence: "As early as 1934, when I was the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union issued booklets entitled "The Revolutionary Strategy of the Chinese Communist Party". Time is limited, and there is no room to list various facts". He引歸 　德迈 General said: "The Chinese government has kept its promise to us, and we have failed to keep our promise to China."

<h3>Sun Ke Talks About Currency Reform, Which Will Inevitably Be Implemented Sooner or Later, and Has Not Heard of the Postponement of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Taipei, 1st] Vice President Sun Ke held a press conference here on the 1st to answer reporters' questions. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of foreign exchange required for industry, mining, and medicine in Taiwan Province, Sun said: "Taiwan Province does not require much foreign exchange. As long as there are about 100 million US dollars within one or two years, all kinds of industries in Taiwan can be restored. The initial supplement for the Taiwan-Hong Kong Power Company only requires a few million US dollars, and the railway only requires a few million. Of course, the current power and railway transportation capacity is still not enough, but if we want to expand further, even if we can't do it ourselves, we can borrow from the US Export-Import Bank. This is not an expenditure, and we can repay it within five to seven years. Taiwan also earns a lot of foreign exchange from the export of local products, and a portion can be used for Taiwan, which can help the industry in Taiwan." Regarding the date of the National Assembly and currency reform, he replied: "The order to convene the National Assembly has been issued, and so far, I have not heard of any postponement. Currency reform must be carried out sooner or later, but currency reform requires full preparation, and I have not heard when it will be implemented."</p>
<p>Explain the issue of National Assembly representatives giving way</p>
<p>Vice President made the following explanation on the issue of National Assembly representatives giving way: This problem occurred entirely because the nomination procedure was not well prepared. Originally, there were regulations in the election law: one is signed nomination, and the other is party nomination, but the scope between the two was not explained. Therefore, some Kuomintang members were nominated by signatures as candidates, and they often won the majority of votes and were elected. Now, asking them to give way to candidates nominated by friendly parties or the party's nomination, the elected candidates themselves say that the election is legal, and asking them to give way is somewhat unfair; however, in terms of party discipline, they should give way. Later, the central government set a compromise, that is, they must give way to friendly parties. This is to accommodate friendly parties, because they cannot be elected otherwise. As for candidates nominated by this party, whether or not to give way is up to them to choose.</p>
<h3>The List of National Assembly Representatives Will Be Announced Soon, It Is Reported That It Has Been Submitted to the National Government by the Election Headquarters, and the List of Kuomintang Members Who Should Give Way Has Also Been Decided</h3>

According to a responsible person: the list of National Assembly representatives will be announced by the National Government soon, and the National Assembly will be convened as scheduled on March 29.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rise of New Aggression</h3>
<p>It has been two months since the U.S. Congress reconvened on January 7 to discuss foreign aid issues. We have only heard senators and representatives debating endlessly without ever touching the actual core of the problem. However, during these two months, the international situation has undergone drastic changes, and the division of the world into two camps has become increasingly blatant, making it impossible for American legislators to continue to debate without reaching a decision. Therefore, Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, loudly appealed in the meeting, demanding that the Senate quickly pass the European Recovery Program and advocating that the nation's strength be concentrated to prevent the outbreak of a third world war. He stated: "Soviet obstruction is sufficient to create obstacles to the future of the aid to Europe plan, but the United States must do everything possible to save the world from danger." Mr. Vandenberg's remarks not only fully demonstrate the seriousness of the current world situation, but also illustrate the urgency of American aid. It is truly worthy of our attention. In particular, his warning to the world that a new aggressive force is rising, although not explicitly naming the Soviet Union, the so-called new aggressive force is self-evident.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee also issued a report, requesting the United States to lead all countries in defending the "non-communist world," otherwise the United States would face a "violent revolution" worldwide. It also put forward ten conclusions: (1) The Communist Party has one goal, which is "world revolution"; (2) The Communist Party believes that revolution must come from violence; (3) The Communist Party has no concept of maintaining peace and expects a third world war to break out soon; (4) The Communist Party believes that the Soviet Union is the main force of the revolution; (5) The Communist Party is most afraid of the union between countries that are against the Soviet Union; (6) The Communist Party is also afraid of the revival or union of the non-communist world; (7) The Communist Party adopts a cold war approach to enhance its own strength and weaken the strength of all other countries; (8) Communist parties other than the Soviet Union are backward partners or auxiliary members; (9) The Communist Party's strategy is based on a definite theory, and its central proposition remains unchanged; (10) The division of Europe and Asia by the victorious countries of World War II will be resolved by power politics rather than negotiation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether these ten views on communist theory and strategy are accurate, the fact that the Communist Party attempts to launch a violent revolution and that the Soviet Union is currently leading all countries in implementing a world revolution is undeniably true. American political and cultural figures have a deep understanding of the danger of the communist movement. Logically, communism is a doctrinal belief that does not disrupt the order of society, but it has now become a threat to world peace. I remember that thirty years ago, at the beginning of the success of the Soviet social revolution, although it also shouted out the slogan of leading the weak and small nations of the world to carry out world revolution, this policy was soon abandoned by the Soviet Union, and a peaceful diplomatic policy was adopted. The communist threat to world peace began to ease. However, thirty years later, the communist forces have made a comeback. Although the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy is still based on "peace" and "security," it has changed its pre-war style. Not only has it erected an "iron curtain" in Eastern Europe and the Far East, but it also wants to go a step further and turn the neighbors surrounding the Soviet Union into its vassal states. The implementation of this aggressive policy has gone from "subtle" to "obvious."</p>
<p>We certainly do not want to place the responsibility for the division of the world entirely on the Soviet Union, but the creation of the division of the world cannot but be said to be due to the Soviet Union's leadership of the Eastern European countries in organizing the new Communist International and proclaiming that it would withdraw from the United Nations organization if necessary, which led to this. Since September of last year, the division of the world has become increasingly clear, and the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union has become increasingly fierce. On the American side, they want to help European countries revive their economies in order to maintain the freedom and independence of their people; on the Soviet side, they are doing everything possible to prevent the implementation of the American aid to Europe plan. Because the United States is a democratic country, all political facilities and diplomatic actions must be approved by Congress before they can be implemented. Therefore, although President Truman or Secretary of State Marshall loudly shouted the slogan of aiding Europe until their lips were parched and their tongues were dry, the aid to Europe plan is still in the discussion stage. It can be said that "the flute sounds loud, but the rain is light." This is the traditional style of democratic countries. However, on the other hand, the Soviet Union is a centralized country that does what it says and can act quickly without being subject to any restrictions. To oppose the realization of the American aid to Europe plan, not only did it organize the new Communist International and order the Eastern European countries to reject American aid in a commanding manner, but it also exerted pressure on countries that needed and welcomed American aid, preventing them from participating in the European Economic Recovery Conference. Czechoslovakia is a good example. Because Czechoslovakia needed funds from Western countries, it was originally one of the countries that supported the Marshall Plan, but after Soviet intervention, it also announced its withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's diplomatic war against the United States does not stop there, and it will further take the offensive. On February 5, the Soviet-Romanian Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed, followed by the Soviet-Hungarian Mutual Assistance Treaty on the 18th. After this coup in Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Communist Party seized power and completely fell into the arms of the Soviet Union. Recently, the Soviet Union forced Finland to sign a mutual assistance treaty. Although Finland is an emerging democratic country, and its people love freedom and independence, it is feared that it will not be able to escape the palm of the Soviet Union due to the general trend. This series of facts is really enough to stimulate the nerves of the world, especially in the eyes of Americans, it is like a thorn in the back, and they will naturally feel deeply threatened. Some observers say that the Soviet Union's outward development has reached a saturation point and will "stop at the right time," but in the eyes of another group of people, if Western countries still adopt a "policy of appeasement" towards the expansion of Soviet power, then the Soviet Union will inevitably take an inch and continue to expand outward. According to a United Press reporter's report, the Soviet Union may take the following three steps in the future: (1) Make the neutral small countries of Northern Europe, namely Norway and Sweden, also become vassals of the Soviet Union; (2) Break through the defense lines of Iran, Turkey, and Greece in order to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean; (3) Attack the positions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Germany and Austria from the side, so that France and Italy will also be ruled by the Communist Party. Although this is the prediction of a United Press reporter, its possibility is very high and worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union in Europe has of course been acting freely there, and it will also let go and do it in Asia. We dare say that the Soviet Union has been taking the lead in the diplomatic war against the United States, while the United States has been failing. If the current policy of the United States is not changed in time, then the prospects for peace in Europe and Asia and even the entire world are very bleak. Vandenberg's urgent appeal should be given extra attention by the American government and people, especially the senators and representatives of the two houses, who should no longer debate endlessly and be unable to reach a consensus on the aid to Europe plan, but should make a decisive and wise decision in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>Dr. Washburn Reports to Reporters That the Plan to Explore Mount Amnye Machin Has Been Agreed Upon with Our Academia Sinica</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Dr. Washburn, head of the scientific group of the Sino-American Amnye Machin Expedition, came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to discuss the distribution of oil and other technical issues during the expedition with Socony-Vacuum Oil Company and China National Aviation Corporation. Mr. Washburn was originally the director of the Boston Museum of Science. He came to China specifically for the exploration of Mount Amnye Machin. He has been in Nanjing for five weeks and has agreed with our government and Academia Sinica on relevant exploration matters. He expressed his appreciation for the spirit of cooperation between China and the United States.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM yesterday, Dr. Washburn met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the Broadway Mansions to report on the technical issues of the exploration of Mount Amnye Machin. After a brief introduction by Wei Jingmeng, director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, he began his report, which stated:</p>
<p>Sino-American Cooperation</p>
<p>Since arriving in China six weeks ago, I have learned more than when I first arrived due to the assistance of Academia Sinica and the Geological Survey. This exploration is a Sino-American cooperation. The American side only provides equipment and personnel that China cannot have immediately. For example, radar is the most important and reliable equipment for measuring altitude. The American side has expert McKay participating. The American side has expert Gussow participating in the geography and glacier departments. Chinese experts, due to environmental reasons, cannot have frequent contact with glacier exploration in the Alaskan region like American experts. Therefore, this type of personnel is also the responsibility of the United States. For anything that China can provide, the American side will not repeat it. In the past two months, a committee has been formed jointly with the Central Research Institute, with a total of 18 members, including Chinese scientists and military representatives, and chaired by Dr. Saponte Tung, to decide that when the expedition team sets out in the future, China will have three or four scientists and officers participating.</p>
<p>Measurement Method</p>
<p>The initial purpose of this trip was to measure the height of Mount Amnye Machin, but now it has been decided to expand to glaciers and terrain. In the past, geographers only knew how to measure from the land. This time, it is planned to measure from the air. Gussow has a wealth of experience in aerial surveying. The measurement method can be briefly described as follows: An aircraft in the expedition team is equipped with six altimeters to allow the aircraft to fly at a certain altitude (this trip is about 30,000 feet). There is a temple 80 miles near Mount Amnye Machin, whose altitude has already been accurately measured by Chinese scientists. The aircraft uses radar waves to measure its altitude above this target, and then maintains the same altitude to fly over the main peak of Mount Amnye Machin, and then uses radio waves to detect it. The difference in height between the two is the height of the main peak of Mount Amnye Machin. The error rate of radar measurement is only 1% to 1.5%. Based on this calculation, the possible measurement difference in the future will also be only three to four hundred feet. As for the climate, it has no impact on the measurement work. Because there is no radio station nearby, the precise longitude and latitude of the main peak cannot be calculated. The rough estimate is calculated by using the direction, speed, and time of flight, and the difference from the correct position should not exceed ten miles. What our team is currently focusing on is aerial surveying. As for the precise ground survey, it requires years of hard work, which remains to be carried out by Chinese scientists.</p>
<p>Denial of Uranium Exploration</p>
<p>At this point, reporters asked whether it was true that the expedition team had a mission to explore uranium mines. Washburn laughed and said: Whether in China or the United States, almost someone asks this question every week. I remember that the first person to ask this question was a reporter from Chicago. At that time, geologist Gussow replied: If an aircraft is equipped with special electromagnetic computing equipment, it can detect whether there are metal ores on the ground, but it cannot determine what kind of metal it is. This type of instrument is too bulky. Once installed on the aircraft, the team will not be able to fit in. Therefore, it was decided not to install it in this exploration aircraft.</p>
<p>Wind and Science Relations</p>
<p>Some reporters also asked why they chose to travel at this time. Washburn replied: The first reason is that Renault and Washburn currently have five months of free time. After this, they will not have time. The second is that March and April to September are ideal periods for exploring Mount Amnye Machin, so it was decided to travel at this time. Some asked whether the snow covering the peaks would hinder the exploration. He replied: No, the wind is very important. If the wind blows from the northwest, it will blow away the snow on the top of the mountain, and we will be able to freely explore and photograph from the northwest, which will facilitate a lot. Washburn also pointed out that the reason why no one has explored Mount Amnye Machin in person in the past is entirely due to the inconvenience of the terrain and transportation.</p>
<p>Rebuttal of Invasion Theory</p>
<p>Regarding the communist officials' claim that the Renault expedition team is an American military invasion of the West, Washburn dismissed it as absurd and said: This trip is entirely scientific in nature. In fact, each flight will be attended by a Chinese military officer to avoid approaching or photographing military targets during the flight. I really can't imagine that our findings and photos have any military value to either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party. I am very grateful for the enthusiastic cooperation of the Chinese government and scientists.</p>
<p>Departure Time</p>
<p>Also, Renault himself has already flown to China from Oakland, California, in a giant C87 aircraft yesterday. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this week. The driver is Odom, who broke the round-the-world flight record by driving an atomic plane. One week after Renault's plane arrives in Shanghai, it will fly to Nanjing and then to Lanzhou to prepare for departure. At that time, if the weather is good, it can depart in two weeks, otherwise it may be extended to one month. The list of Chinese personnel has now been decided to be four people, and the remaining four are still to be discussed. Also, this aerial exploration is unprecedented, and many Chinese and foreign journalists have requested to accompany it. Everything remains to be decided after Renault and Saponte Tung discuss it. According to Dr. Washburn yesterday: The number of people will be limited, the only reason being that the oxygen supply is not easy. This oxygen must be airlifted from the United States to Tokyo, then to Shanghai, and then to remote Lanzhou.</p>
<h3>Renault Exploration Plane Rescheduled to Fly to China Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Oakland, California, Dispatch of the 2nd] Round-the-world flyer Odom decided on the 3rd to take off on the morning of the 3rd, carrying a scientific expedition team to China. The departure date has been postponed twice due to mechanical problems. Odom said: The aircraft is a modified Liberator bomber, carrying a total of 30 tons of scientific equipment. The aircraft may be hit by strong tailwinds between California and Honolulu on the 3rd. "We may reschedule the departure date again due to the weather." Among the sixteen passengers, there are Gu Weijun's son and Mrs. Gu, the chief secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the United States, both of whom are going to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Amnye Machin Photography Exhibition to Be Held in Shanghai Starting on the 6th</h3>
<p>[This City Dispatch] Zhuang Xueben, an advisor to the Xikang Provincial Government, went to the Mount Amnye Machin area in southern Qinghai in 1934 and engaged in investigation work for several months. He took many photos of Mount Amnye Machin and the sources of the Yellow River and Yangtze River. This time, American Renault is coming to China and will explore the mountain from the air. He has formed a Sino-American Amnye Machin exploration team jointly with our Academia Sinica, which is about to start work. In order to introduce the actual situation on the ground in the area, Mr. Zhuang has released his old works from more than ten years ago to hold an Amnye Machin area photography exhibition. It was exhibited for three days at the Nanjing Frontier Culture and Education Museum on February 20, 21, and 22. Mr. Zhuang has returned to Shanghai last week and is scheduled to hold a public exhibition at the French Literature Association at the entrance of Fuxing Park on the 6th and 7th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chairman Summons Zheng Lie and Zhao Chen</h3>
<p>Inquired About the Trial of Traitor Cases</p>
<p>[Our Nanking dispatch of the 2nd] Chairman Chiang summoned Zheng Lie, Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court, and Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, at around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to inquire about the recent work of the two courts and the trial of traitor cases.</p>
<h3>Northeast People's Petition Delegation's Written Statement in Nanking</h3>
<p>[Continued from page 1] "The seriousness of the situation in the Northeast has almost aroused the concern of the whole country. Chairman Chiang's expression of firm adherence to the Northeast further represents the common will of the military and civilians of the whole country. Our delegation was entrusted by the entire people of the Northeast to come to Nanjing to petition. Upon hearing this, we are deeply encouraged." However, the deteriorating situation in the Northeast is an undeniable fact. What the people of the Northeast demand from the government today is to quickly reinforce the army and reverse the situation. The fate of survival is imminent. The government must properly plan solutions to how to supply food and improve the economy. At this time when the country is suffering, the people of the Northeast deeply know the government's difficult situation. We do not need to pursue the responsibility for the gains and losses in the reception process in the past two years. However, from the painful lessons of the past, we must learn from the past and be careful in the future, and find a way to save the situation. It is necessary to implement the government's determination to firmly defend the Northeast with resolute and wise policies. Therefore, in military affairs, we should immediately deploy elite troops to the Northeast, at least to ensure the supply lines of Shenyang and Yingkou, and the strongholds of Jilin and Changchun, so as to actively carry out the reception of the Northeast. Economically, we should immediately rectify the financial situation in the Northeast and make reasonable adjustments in order to smoothly supply the military and civilian needs. If this cannot be effectively and quickly implemented, then the Northeast will encounter a fate more serious than the September 18th Incident, and this delegation dares to assert that it is not far away, and its impact on our entire country and nation is even greater than imagined. Based on this, our delegation plans to pay a visit to the Chairman and government authorities to petition for assistance, and especially wishes to urge the people of the country to work together to save the Northeast, which is also to save ourselves and save the country. We hope that this trip will have results to comfort the people of the Northeast."</p>

<h3>"Fuxing" Anti-Smuggling Ship Colludes with Unscrupulous Merchants in Smuggling</h3>
<p>Ship's Captain Detained in Xiamen After Seizure</p>
<p>[Our Xiamen Dispatch, 2nd] The "Fuxing" anti-smuggling ship has colluded with unscrupulous merchants in smuggling on more than one occasion. A day ago, the ship transported over a hundred pieces of smuggled goods, worth an estimated 2 billion yuan in national currency, from Hong Kong, which were seized by the Xiamen Customs.

<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 2nd] The Nanchang market is gradually stabilizing. Top-grade late rice is trading at 1.4 million, and high-grade Jiangbei cotton is priced at 8.3 million. The yarn market is slightly up, with 21-count "Airplane" yarn at 70.6 million. The exchange rates for the Four Banks and Two Bureaus were adjusted on the 2nd, with Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Xun falling by 5 yuan, revised to 10 yuan, and Hankou falling by 10 yuan, revised to 20 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 2nd] Grain prices in Sichuan have continued to decline for several days. On the 2nd, Rong rice (double shi) was priced at 2.77 million. The provincial government is also rushing to transport 300,000 shi of public grain to Chengdu for sale, and rice prices are expected to continue to fall. Amidst severe credit tightening, inflationary pressures have eased slightly.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] Commodity prices here have recently soared, leading to increasingly tight credit conditions. Additionally, authorities will strictly investigate hoarding and stabilize prices.

<h3>Full Text of Minister of Defense Bai's Report on Recent Bandit Suppression Military Affairs</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's first page) We know that the communist bandits have theory, organization, twenty years of fighting experience, and even international background, cannot be compared to ordinary bandits, or individual forces in the war of resistance against past warlords. Because in the areas where the communist bandits are now running rampant, the people are coerced by them and completely banditized. Therefore, the current bandit suppression is not only a military and political struggle, but also an ideological struggle. We must use the Three Principles of the People to combat communism, and use the power of organization to combat the organization of the communist bandits. More specifically, we must use military power to cover up politics, and use political power to [blank] the entire foundation, to cooperate with the military. We must unite the power of the party, government, and military into a strong [blank] combat body, and actively organize and train the people, enhance the people's self-defense capabilities, cooperate with the army, develop comprehensive tactics, and strive for [blank]. Bandit suppression should focus on three parts military and seven parts political, with the primary focus of politics being to win people's hearts and unleash people's power to adapt to bandit suppression military affairs and stabilize the local area. In terms of economy, we must stabilize people's livelihoods in order to eliminate the root of unrest. Since the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Manchu Qing autocracy, it was to realize the Principle of Democracy. The defeat of the warlords during the Northern Expedition was also to realize the Principle of Democracy. The eight-year war of resistance against Japan was to realize the Principle of Nationalism. The current bandit suppression is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, in addition to using political and military power to suppress bandits, we must also suppress bandits economically. Economically, we must thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, equalize land ownership, and restrict capital. I remember that in 1924, the first National Congress of our party had a resolution to reduce rent by 25%, but it was not implemented immediately. The communist bandits, however, implemented their "land reform" in their occupied areas, exaggeratedly promoting it internationally, and even used brutal methods of liquidation and struggle to forcibly distribute land. Their distribution method is to allocate land equally according to the number of farmers and the total area of land in a certain area, regardless of the interests of a few landlords and capitalists, sacrificing the minority to win over the majority of farmers. Regarding the land illegally distributed by the communist bandits in the pacified areas, the central government had previously promulgated the "Measures for the Handling of Land in the Pacified Areas," the main principle of which is to vigorously implement the 25% rent reduction, strictly prohibit landlords from evicting tenants, and recover old debts. Land that has been illegally distributed by the communist bandits, and whose landlords are missing, will be confiscated by the county government. Eighty percent of the country's population is farmers, and our economic foundation should not be based on cities, but on the vast countryside. Therefore, we must thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and the land policy to achieve the ideal of "land to the tiller," so that the majority of farmers are not threatened or lured by bandits. The entire problem of people's livelihood must be solved before we are oppressed by livelihood, incited by bandits, and take risks. At the same time, it is enough to promote self-defense, cultivate their self-defense capabilities, protect their homeland, and stabilize society, which is also the fundamental way to eliminate the communist bandits. We know that the development of international communism came after the First World War. The opposition between labor and capital and the disparity between the rich and the poor led to class struggle. After this war, in Europe, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and other countries, they also became vassals of the Third International. Therefore, from the perspective of the international situation today, if we still use capitalism to implement anti-communism, the working masses of all countries will still inevitably have class consciousness more important than national consciousness, class concepts more important than national concepts, and class interests more important than national interests, creating opportunities for communists to incite class struggle, and failing to eliminate labor-capital disputes and opposition. After this war, in order to overcome economic difficulties, Britain vigorously implemented frugality. From the King of England to the general public, they all absolutely followed the national policy with a spirit of law-abiding. At the same time, what is more active is to nationalize large-scale mines, industries, railways, and banks, and use political power to implement social policies, making a more active anti-communism [blank]. Therefore, from the perspective of the international situation, we want to implement economic suppression of communism, stabilize people's livelihoods [blank], and seek the early realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, while strengthening the people's self-defense capabilities and cooperating with military suppression, which is the fundamental strategy to curb the development of communist bandits and weaken the bandit scourge. The above is what Chongxi felt and contributed a little meaning, please give me your advice. (End)</p>

<h3>The Five-Nation Alliance of Britain, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg May Be Realized in Mid-Month: Political, Military and Economic Ties Are Tightened, Premiers of Five Nations Will Meet in Brussels to Draft Treaty Details</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] Diplomatic circles expect that within two weeks, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and other countries will be able to form a military and economic alliance agreement. Western Europe is strengthening its fortress to prevent the continued intrusion of communism. It is said that Belgium and the Netherlands are adopting measures to control communist activities. The powerful Labor Party in the Netherlands has identified the Communist Party as the fifth column and refused to continue cooperation with it. The Belgian Labor Federation [blank] and other agencies have also purged all communist elements.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The French government has notified the Belgian government, expressing its support for starting negotiations with Britain and the Benelux countries as soon as possible to conclude a five-power alliance treaty. The Belgian government will decide on the date and location of these negotiations. According to unofficial reports from Belgium, the five-power conference to discuss the establishment of a Western European alliance will be held in Belgium on Friday. A preparatory meeting of the three Benelux countries is scheduled to be held on Wednesday. At the five-power conference on Friday, the representatives will draft the general principles of the treaty, which will be approved by the leaders of the five countries at the next meeting. This convention will focus on the economy, but will also include political, military and cultural elements. Some people even expect this convention to be signed before March 15. After signing, an expert committee will be set up to supervise the implementation of the articles. The statement that the five-power meeting will be held in Brussels on Friday and the preparatory meeting convened by the Benelux countries on the 30th has not yet been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the five-power talks are scheduled to be held in Brussels this Thursday to discuss the implementation plan for the Western countries alliance proposed by Foreign Secretary Bevin. At that time, the British and French governments will appoint ambassadors to Belgium to participate. It is generally believed that the Belgian government is willing to hold the trial in Brussels on Friday. In addition to its ambassador, the United Kingdom and France will continue to send representatives to attend. Bevin announced in the House of Commons on January 22 that the Western European alliance would be formed to deal with the Soviet Union's control of Europe, and the United States expressed its approval the next day.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 1st] Experts from the three Benelux countries will make final revisions to the three countries' proposals in Belgium on Wednesday. The outline of the proposal has been formulated yesterday.</p>
<h3>French Communist Party Establishes Action Committee, Ministry of Interior Confirms Conspiracy to Launch a Similar Event to the Czech Coup</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] "Paris Evening News" claims that the Belgrade Communist Information Bureau announced that a Communist Defense Committee similar to the Czech Communist Party Action Committee has been established in France. The Bureau's communique stated that the activities of the Communist Party in France include the establishment of defense federations and defense committees in all branches of the national economy and among all levels of people, including workers, farmers, and merchants. The purpose of these organizations is to defend the economic and political independence of France in the context of the gradual expansion of the forces of Anglo-American imperialism. Communist Defense Committees have been set up in 70 French aircraft factories, and Defense Committees are also being organized in the automobile manufacturing and power industries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] A spokesman for the French Ministry of the Interior recently confirmed the above news reported in "Paris Evening News." The spokesperson said that we have previously learned about the establishment of Defense Committees by the French Communist Party throughout the country. These committees are very similar to the Czech Action Committee, which is the institution that helped the Czech Communist Party gain control. The French police and security forces have sufficient intelligence on the activities of these Defense Committees in France. The spokesperson also said that we know when the French Communist Party will launch its plan, and the government is fully prepared for it, but we do not believe that the Communist Party's plan has been solemnly launched.</p>
<h3>Molotov Claims There Will Be No War in Five Years</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] Labor MP Captain Braben said in the House of Commons on the 1st that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had told those attending his banquet in London less than three months ago that there would be no new war for at least five years.

<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 1st] Soviet representative Gromyko spoke for an hour at a closed-door meeting of the United Nations Universal Disarmament Committee today, accusing Britain and the United States of obstructing universal disarmament and completely opposing Britain's proposal to restore international trust and plant the seeds. Mr. Ge said that Britain obviously has no intention of disarming, and representatives of the committee are wasting the United Nations' paper and membership fees. Mr. Ge also pointed out that Britain and the United States are obstructing the international control of atomic energy and the establishment of the United Nations guard army, saying that if the representatives take an attitude that violates the United Nations Charter one day, the International Army will not be established one day.</p>

<p>Conservative Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British government's proposed defense policy for the United Kingdom was passed by the House of Commons today with a vote of 243 to 121. The Conservative amendment was rejected. At the end of the debate, Prime Minister Attlee, amid cheers, declared that the government's policy aims to prevent Germany from aggression again. It will cooperate with other allies and friendly nations, so that it can participate in the unity of Europe on an equal footing. The UK and its dominions have achieved close cooperation on defense issues, unprecedented before. However, we are still insufficient and willing to seek change. He then discussed the general anxiety felt by Europeans, stating that it was due to the extreme expansion of the dictatorial system. Finally, Attlee said he was unwilling for Britain to unilaterally disclose military information first and hoped that countries behind the iron curtain could publish this information. At the beginning of the debate, Defense Minister Alexander spoke, emphasizing that Britain must express its determination to maintain its strength. If we cannot accept this simple and basic truth, it will be detrimental to ourselves and all of humanity.</p>

<h3>Strack Suggests to U.S. Army Department to Retain Japanese Industrial Equipment; Most of the Listed Compensation Items are Retained</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] America's major industrial engineering and consulting firm has advised the Army Department not to remove Japanese production equipment from Japan. The Overseas Consultants, Inc., which conducted a study on Japan's industrial potential and the conditions required for Japan's economic recovery and stability, released its 175-page report today, advising the Army Department that removing all Japanese production equipment except for basic war industry equipment would hinder global production and reduce Japan's possibility of achieving self-sufficiency. In any case, this would increase the time required to complete this goal. This would be a waste of American taxpayers' money and not the most advantageous thing to do when facing countries demanding compensation.</p>
<p>Overseas Consultants, Inc. is headed by Mr. Strack, Chairman of McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. The group began studying Japanese issues in Tokyo last July and completed its on-site investigation in December. The Strack Committee issued a list of factories and industrial conveniences that Japan should retain and those that could be used for compensation, so that Japan could retain certain industrial capacities deemed necessary for Japan's self-sufficient economy, which have been tentatively determined by the US State, Army, and Navy Coordinating Committee. This list includes: (1) Pig iron: Japan retains 2 million metric tons, with 1.6 million tons for compensation. (2) Steel plates: Japan retains 3.5 million metric tons, with 2.9 million tons for compensation. (3) Steel bars: Japan retains 2.65 million metric tons, with 1.55 million tons for compensation. (4) Sulfuric acid: Japan retains 3.51675 million metric tons, with 1.140575 million tons for compensation. (5) Caustic soda: Japan retains 4.193 million tons, with none for compensation. (6) Synthetic rubber: Japan retains none, with 900 tons for compensation. (7) Bearing manufacturing industry: Japan retains a value of 59.318 billion yen. The report suggests that Japan should retain virtually all hydroelectric power and 1.2405 million gross tons of shipping, of which only 59,500 tons are for compensation. The committee stated that US Army and Navy officials will require the retention of Japan's entire oil refining industry, which produces 9.80775 million barrels of oil annually, and its storage capacity of 7.293 million barrels.</p>
<h3>Hull's Memoirs (38)</h3>
<p>— North American Newspaper Alliance Copyright, Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>Last Task Before Health Collapse</p>
<p>Secretary Morgenthau returned to Washington from Quebec, while the President went to Hyde Park first, where Prime Minister Churchill visited him. Morgenthau was extremely excited about the work he had completed, and he rushed to find Secretary of War Stimson and me, along with others, with his latest copy of the plan (referring to the plan to turn Germany into a primarily agricultural country - Editor's News Service).</p>
<p>On September 20, 1944, I convened a cabinet subcommittee meeting in my office, attended by Morgenthau, Stimson, White from the Treasury Department, McCloy, Under Secretary of War, and Matthews from the State Department, to review these developments. I did not hide my shock at what the President and Mr. Churchill had agreed upon at Quebec at Morgenthau's insistence. I thought it was a tragedy in every respect. I emphasized that I did not consider this a done deal.</p>
<p>Morgenthau said that the President's invitation for him to go to Quebec was completely unexpected, and he didn't want people to think he had orchestrated it. Then, he gave a lengthy explanation of the Quebec Conference. He said that Mr. Churchill initially strongly opposed Morgenthau's proposed policy toward Germany. The Prime Minister bluntly asked if he had been invited to Quebec to discuss a plan to "feed Britain on the corpse (of Germany)."</p>
<p>Morgenthau turned to Stimson and said, "Harley, he was even more upset than you." Stimson and I were equally annoyed by Morgenthau's high-handed approach to the Quebec negotiations. Because this was primarily a matter for the State Department and the War Department, he did not consult us beforehand, and he made no secret of this.</p>
<p>Morgenthau said that he later discussed the matter with Sir Cherwell, the Prime Minister's personal assistant, and apparently persuaded him. Cherwell discussed it with Churchill and won his agreement. This suggestion apparently moved the Prime Minister on the grounds that Britain could from then on obtain many of Germany's former steel markets, eliminating a dangerous competitor. Morgenthau said they tried many times to put this understanding into writing, but the Prime Minister was never satisfied. So he called in his own secretary and dictated his understanding of the agreement. This is the document that the President and the Prime Minister signed and sent to me on September 15. Morgenthau said that it was all drafted by Mr. Churchill.</p>
<p>Stimson frankly asked Morgenthau if there was any connection between Churchill's acceptance of this policy and his eagerness to obtain the loan that Morgenthau had promised him. Morgenthau denied it, but he said that the loan was obviously the Prime Minister's main goal in Quebec besides military matters.</p>
<p>Morgenthau said that the next day, Foreign Secretary Eden came to Quebec and was very surprised at the President and Prime Minister's agreement on Germany. Eden and Mr. Churchill had a heated discussion, and Prime Minister Churchill told Eden not to raise it in the War Cabinet until he himself returned to England, because he intended to work hard to get it passed.</p>
<p>Morgenthau said that Eden's opposition came as a surprise to him, because he had gotten the opposite impression when he discussed it with Eden in London not long ago. This statement told us that even before Quebec, the Secretary of Treasury had discussed this matter, which was primarily under the purview of the State Department and the War Department, with British officials.</p>
<p>Regarding the loan, Morgenthau said that he knew the President was prepared to fully accept the Prime Minister's opinion. But he, Morgenthau, insisted on establishing a committee to draft the plan. He didn't seem to think that this committee could obtain British cooperation to implement a free economic policy, but he felt that this would at least give the United States a foothold. He said that the President did not raise any questions about what economic policies Britain should adopt in return for our assistance. I said without hesitation that I was extremely surprised that such an important issue was decided without prior consultation with the appropriate experts in our government and without regard to the policies we had promoted in the past. Shortly after the President returned to Washington, I went to see him at the White House. I brought with me the memorandum he gave me on September 15 and Morgenthau's plan. (The September 15 memorandum stated that the President and Mr. Churchill had reached an agreement on the contents of the Morgenthau Plan - Editor's News Service.)</p>
<p>I frankly told the President that Morgenthau's plan made no sense and that no experts, no relevant officials in our government, nor the President, nor other governments had participated in preparing this plan. I also said that Morgenthau's plan would eliminate everything in Germany except the land. The Germans would have to live off the land. This meant that only 60% of the Germans could survive off the land, and the remaining 40% would die.</p>
<p>I said that I would keep two points in mind when dealing with the post-war German issue. First, Germany must be under military occupation for 25 or 50 years, depending on the need, until they have completely eliminated all Nazi theories and ideas, as well as the absurd notion that Germany is a superior nation with the right to rule other nations. Second, the living standards of the German people should be below the average living standards of the people of the countries they had invaded, but should gradually increase to the extent that they change from Nazism, a sense of national superiority, to human rights, individual freedom, and peaceful thought.</p>
<p>I finally said that I was shocked to discover that the British had also agreed to this extreme starvation policy in Quebec, simply in order to obtain Morgenthau's assistance and the $6.5 billion loan recommended by the Treasury Department. I specifically criticized this loan.</p>
<p>The first reason, I said, was that negotiations with Britain should be primarily conducted by the State Department, because it is the agency used by the government to conduct negotiations with foreign governments. Second, because Morgenthau's plan was not attached with conditions. There are many issues outstanding between us and Britain, and we should seek to resolve or act on them, and the loan can be used as part of our bargaining power against the British. Morgenthau set aside or ignored these issues and promised a $6.5 billion loan without conditions, without prior consultation with the State Department or relevant government officials in Congress.</p>
<p>I finally said that, aside from other major reasons for opposing this plan, if Morgenthau's plan were to leak out and the President were to endorse the plan, it would be a great damage to his political position when he was conducting the 1944 presidential election.</p>
<p>During this conversation, the President said very little, except to point out that he actually had not completely believed in Morgenthau's plan, in fact, he had not realized that the September 15 memorandum he had signed, "O.K. F.D.R.", was of such great adverse nature.</p>
<p>At this time, I asked my State Department colleagues to help me prepare another memorandum for the President. This memorandum was dated September 29, and I personally handed it to the President on October 1 and discussed its main points with him.</p>
<p>The next day, I received the President's memorandum to me, written on September 29. This was written before my conversation with him on October 1. This memorandum fully showed that he had not realized the extent to which he was implicated in Quebec under Morgenthau's instigation.</p>
<p>He wrote: "The main crux of the situation is to prevent Britain from going completely bankrupt at the end of the war." He put special emphasis on the last sentence, underlining it twice in ink.</p>
<p>In the past week, several articles in the newspapers have pointed out the severe nature of the post-war German treatment discussed in Quebec. This became a powerful weapon for the Nazi propaganda machine, motivating the Germans to fight to the end.</p>
<p>The President said in his memorandum, "Someone not only told the press too early, but said (as is) that it was fundamentally untrue."</p>
<p>"There is no need to make Germany a completely superior country again, but someone told the press, and I hope we can find this person and punish him."</p>
<p>(Secretary Stimson later told me that the President believed that the news was leaked by the State Department. Stimson said that the first syndicated columnist to discuss this matter wrote an article and that this writer had close ties with some officials in the Treasury Department, which made the President believe that the news was not leaked by the State Department or the War Department).</p>
<p>The President continued, "You know that pre-war Germany not only established a war industry, but also established sufficient foreign trade, enabling it to have sufficient financial resources to rearm, while still maintaining international credit, and not going bankrupt in the international economy."</p>
<p>"I cannot agree with the idea of watching the British Empire collapse financially while allowing Germany to form a potential rearmament industry, making it possible to launch another war in twenty years. Merely inspecting factories will not prevent this."</p>
<p>"But no one wants to "completely eliminate German industrial production capacity in the Ruhr and Saar regions."</p>
<p>"But we may implement comprehensive control in those two special areas. At the same time, it should also be remembered that besides the Ruhr and the Saar, Germany has many other (he underlined "other") areas and equipment capable of producing large quantities of export goods."</p>
<p>Speaking of the Soviet Union, regarding my insistence that any plan regarding Germany must be discussed with the Soviet government, he said:</p>
<p>"Regarding the Soviet government, we still don't know what ideas they have in mind, but we should remember that within their occupation zone, they will always do what they want, and we will only be able to protest from time to time, unless some protests are heeded." "I am not trying to stop or delay negotiations with the Soviet government on the Lend-Lease Act on the basis of full supervision or on the basis of the proposed Fourth Draft, but this is not directly related to the future of German industry."</p>
<p>My conversation with the President on October 1 made it unnecessary for me to take any further action on his memorandum. But this memorandum helped me understand the line of thought that the President was exploring. In his mind, Britain's future was related to the success or failure of Germany's future. After the war, Britain had to restore its export trade, but he felt that if Germany was allowed to develop a strong export trade competition, Britain's export trade could not recover. So he adopted Morgenthau's plan. But he forgot that although Churchill signed the agreement, Britain was the least willing to turn Germany into a most desolate country, because if bankrupt German steel caused the European economy to collapse, it would harm Britain's livelihood.</p>
<p>The President's memorandum also clearly showed that he did not understand the significance of what he had agreed to in Quebec. At this time, Secretary Stimson had a conversation with the President, and Stimson came to the same conclusion. He told me that he had read a few sentences from the President's September 15 memorandum to him, concluding with: "Prepare to turn Germany into a primarily agricultural and pastoral country."</p>
<p>Stimson told me that the President, upon hearing these sentences, frankly expressed doubt and said that he did not know how he could have signed this memorandum. He had obviously signed it without much thought.</p>
<p>In short, after my conversation with him, the President no longer adopted Morgenthau's views on Germany. Three weeks after receiving my September 29 memorandum, on October 20, he gave me a reply. He began by saying: "I think it is appropriate for us to make all preparations for dealing with Germany, but some things about this treatment make me feel that there is no urgent need to deal with them at present. This may be in a week, maybe in a month, maybe in a few months, I do not want to draw up a detailed plan for a country we have not yet occupied."</p>
<p>He said that he agreed with our plan to disarm Germany and suggested that everything related to aircraft should be included. He wholeheartedly agreed with our plan to dissolve the Nazi Party and its related organizations, as well as extensively control transportation, newspapers, and propaganda. He agreed with our suggestion that there should be no decision on the possible division of Germany in the future. Regarding economic objectives, he said: "I would like to discuss some of the wording with the State Department again. In principle, I agree, but I do not know the meaning of some parts. Most of this part of the problem will depend on the actual situation we encounter after we and the Allies enter Germany--but we have not yet arrived in Germany."</p>
<p>The opinions of me and my colleagues in the September 4 and 29 memoranda were generally agreed upon by the War Department, and later agreed to by Britain and the Soviet Union, and roughly became the policy implemented after the occupation of Germany. Morgenthau continued to support the theory of crushing Germany, and his views had the opposite effect on the Allied plan for Germany, resulting in a more severe plan than we had envisioned in the State Department before I resigned. However, years of experience in occupying Germany, coupled with the fact that what we called the close relationship between the German economy and the European economy was correct, resulted in the British and American governments abandoning that theory.</p>
<p>My conversation with the President on October 1 was the last important task I did during his term. At that time, my health was on the verge of collapse, and I had to submit my resignation.</p>
<h3>Menon and Hu Shih-Tze Fly to Seoul to Supervise South Korean Elections; Student Demonstrations in Seoul Clash</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gongju Lake, 1st] Menon, Chairman of the United Nations Delegation to Korea, accompanied by Hu Shih-Tze, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, flew from New York to Seoul tonight. Before his departure, Menon told a reporter from the Central News Agency, "We will do our best to implement the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the Korean issue." Menon and Hu are carrying the emergency powers granted by the UN General Assembly to supervise elections in South Korea and establish a Korean national government, because the delegation to Korea has been refused entry into Soviet-controlled North Korea.</p>
<p>Menon hopes that the delegation's work will be successful. He said: "This will show "great progress" towards achieving an independent and free Korea." Menon revealed: The date of the Korean elections on May 9 was suggested by him to General Hodge, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, during a long-distance telephone call across the Pacific. He explained that the May 9 date would facilitate the participation of Korean farmers in the vote and allow sufficient time for preparation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Seoul, 1st] Clashes occurred during student demonstrations here today, severely injuring twelve people. U.S. forces in Seoul have been ordered to be on alert.

Rhee told the crowd that the United Nations was Korea's only hope.</p>
<h3>Effective Measures to Stabilize Prices: Three Suggestions Passed by the City Council to Set Up a Public Utilities Investigation Committee After Economic Debate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its sixth meeting yesterday afternoon and continued to discuss proposals. The meeting first discussed how to stabilize prices (including four items: temporary motions and other proposals). After review by the Special Review Committee, the revised resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding foreign exchange allocation and listing: (2) It is recommended to the central government that the government increase the amount of foreign exchange for imported grains, cotton, machinery, industrial raw materials, public utilities, and transportation fuel, and properly formulate measures to fully utilize private foreign exchange and private foreign deposits to import the above-mentioned materials. (2) It is recommended to the central government to avoid raising foreign exchange rates at any time as much as possible. (3) It is recommended to the central government that overseas remittances should be given appropriate subsidies in addition to the exchange rate settlement. (4) It is recommended to the central government to encourage the export of materials as much as possible to increase foreign exchange income. (5) It is recommended to the central government to adopt an import and export linkage system as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding government control of materials and sales prices: It is recommended to the central government that the central government agencies and public utilities in Shanghai that control materials should appoint personnel familiar with the actual situation of industry and commerce to preside over the handling, and try to purchase daily necessities made by domestic factories to facilitate the production and sales of domestic goods and the turnover of funds. The purpose should not be solely for profit. When coordinating with the current national policy of suppressing the rebellion, the allocation and supply of materials should stabilize prices. If it is absolutely necessary to moderately adjust the selling price of its supplied materials, it should be implemented after obtaining the consent of the local government in advance.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding how to stabilize the prices of public utilities and transportation: It is recommended to the central government to restore the subsidy system for public utilities and transportation, at least for the materials and fuels (such as coal, firewood, oil, and gasoline) necessary for each of these industries. The government is requested to stipulate a reasonably stable allocation or settlement price within three months to reduce the factors of price increases in public utilities and transportation.</p>
<p>In addition, Councilor Wang Guoxian proposed the restoration of industrial loans, which will be discussed after a separate proposal is made.</p>
<h3>Zhai Cheng Opposes Retaining the Investigation of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>In addition to the above proposal, the conference also discussed a total of nine proposals regarding public utilities: (1) Regarding the case of "requesting the conference to organize a public utilities investigation committee to review the actual costs of various public utilities to reduce the burden on citizens," the debate was the most intense. The review opinion of the Public Utilities Committee on the case was temporarily reserved. The reason is that for this specialized issue, it is feared that the councilors will not get results by sending representatives to investigate. At the same time, the council trusts the government and should be responsible for handling it. However, Qu Yue firmly opposed the reservation, believing that the councilors should not be afraid of taking responsibility, nor should they fail to investigate because they are not experts. Taking judges as an example, they are not necessarily experts in every kind of issue, but they still have the responsibility to try cases. At the same time, the council should also share the difficulties encountered by the government. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, also stood up and said: I hope the council will consider establishing an investigation committee so that the citizens' representatives can truly understand the actual costs and prices of public utilities.</p>
<h3>One Faction Believes It May Not Be Effective</h3>
<p>On the other hand, there are also many who agree to retain it. Lu Yinchu said that the competent authority is clearer about the cost situation and investigation technology of public utilities than the council. It should be handled by the government. At the same time, the government should be able to exert its ability. If there is dereliction of duty, the council should strengthen its supervision. Zhang Zhihan ridiculed that the municipal government should send representatives or hire personnel to organize it, and the council does not need to "carry a pole." Li Wenjie also said: There are many things for the council to do, and each councilor also has many things to do. If a lot of time is spent, and it is still an outsider, the investigation will not be effective, so it is not advocated that the council be responsible.</p>
<h3>The People's Food Adjustment Committee Asks the Central Government Whether the Price of Rice Can Be Reduced; Citizens in Many Districts Have Not Yet Received Distribution Certificates</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's comprehensive rice distribution is actively underway. Some citizens in Yangshupu and Yulin districts have begun to purchase rice with certificates since the day before yesterday. Zhabei District also started yesterday. Mayor Wu previously set a deadline for each district to issue the rice distribution certificates to every household before March 3rd, but so far, citizens in many districts have not yet received the rice distribution certificates. The People's Food Adjustment Committee has separately supervised. According to the Director of the Adjustment Committee, Ren Xianqun, the biggest difficulty encountered at the beginning of rice distribution is the delay in issuing certificates in various districts, which has a profound impact on the progress of the work. As of yesterday, more than 10,000 tons of US relief rice have arrived in Shanghai, and more than 1,000 tons will arrive within the day. The relief rice distributed and sold in Shanghai this month can obtain approximately 1 trillion legal currency.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Ren Xianqun, Director of the People's Food Adjustment Committee, urgently requested instructions from the central government last night on whether the price of 2.4 million yuan for distributed rice could be reduced. The distributed rice is indica rice, and the market price of Du Indica is 2.52 million yuan. Adding a 6% profit for retail sales should be 2.67 million yuan. However, each stone of Du Indica rice actually weighs 156 city catties, and the government calculates it based on 150 catties per stone, which should be a 96% discount, only 2.56 million yuan. However, the profit of rice shops is actually not 6%, so yesterday the retail price of Du Indica rice was sold for 2.4 million yuan. Therefore, the People's Food Adjustment Committee had to request instructions from the central government on whether to follow the price reduction.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Shen Tiezheng at Guoen Temple</h3>
<p>Shen Tiezheng, a member of the Tongmenghui, was killed by bandits last winter when he returned to his hometown. The Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association specially initiated a memorial service at Guoen Temple on Puan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, and Zhang Daofan, heads of various ministries and commissions of the central government, all sent elegies. Party and government leaders Fang Zhi, Wu Guozhen (represented by Wang Guanqing), Zhu Ping, and more than 300 old comrades of the Xinhai Revolution attended. Fang Zhi presided over the ceremony, and Yuan Xiluo, Ji Qiyun, Hong Chengdian, and Wang Zhaolin accompanied the ceremony. After playing music and performing the ceremony, Wang Zhen reported on the revolutionary deeds of Martyr Shen and the situation of being killed by the Communist bandits. Then Fang Zhi, Yuan Xiluo, and others delivered speeches, encouraging comrades to carry forward the spirit of the martyrs. The ceremony ended at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Compromise Passed by Majority Vote</h3>
<p>Under the deadlock, Mayor Wu expressed his opinion, saying: For half a year last year, foreign exchange and coal prices did not rise, which made the prices of public utilities very stable. The citizens all said that the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau handled the business best, but Director Zhao was very modest and did not recognize his achievements. The current situation is different. Foreign exchange and coal prices have risen, so how can the prices of public utilities not rise? It is not appropriate for me to agree that Director Zhao is at fault. However, the council's criticism of the municipal government is a very good phenomenon, because it can improve municipal administration. Therefore, I suggest a compromise plan for this case, that is, this investigation committee can be organized by the Public Utilities Bureau and be fully responsible for it. Councilors do not need to be responsible, because they cannot criticize it after being responsible. Councilors can participate in the capacity of observers, can speak and ask questions, and can also understand the situation. After the Mayor finished speaking, Tao Baichuan still agreed that the council should investigate various issues related to public utilities. Finally, the Speaker put it to a vote, and the result was that a small number of people agreed to retain it. As a result, Shao Yongsheng's suggestion was adopted, and the organization of the investigation committee was passed. The methods are as follows: (1) The conference shall establish a public utilities investigation committee, authorize it to review whether the cost calculation of various public utilities is correct and reasonable, and study fair standard calculation methods, and send it to the municipal government for reference. (2) The investigation committee shall be jointly organized by 25 people publicly elected by the conference and representatives from each subcommittee, with the Speaker and Deputy Speaker as ex-officio members, and convened by the Speaker. (3) The investigation work shall be carried out in groups. After the investigation report is passed by the entire committee, it shall be sent to the municipal government for reference by the council.</p>
<p>The Motor Tricycle Case is Sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for Research</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the case of "canceling the quota allocation of gasoline for automobiles to eliminate the black market," the subcommittee's review opinion is to recommend that the central government cancel the quota allocation of gasoline for automobiles and allow the transfer of automobiles, and strictly prohibit the import of small passenger cars. However, some people opposed the cancellation in the conference, such as Zhang Zhihan and Fei Shusheng, who believed that there should be restrictions to save foreign exchange. Zhou Xiangsheng and Chu Shun and others said that the gasoline quota is not related to foreign exchange and should still be canceled. After a vote, this case was retained and handled according to the current method. However, according to Zhao, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, if agencies and groups have special needs and need to increase their gasoline consumption, they can explain the reasons and apply.</p>
<p>(3) "In order to facilitate transportation and meet economy, please the conference discuss the newly manufactured motor tricycle for operation in this city." The review opinion is temporarily reserved. There are two reasons: (1) Because Shanghai is already full of various vehicles, traffic will be more difficult to maintain after adding new vehicles; (2) The safety issue is worth studying, so it is advocated to postpone it. However, most councilors such as Shao Yongsheng and Qu Yue expressed that the new invention of the people should be encouraged, and at least a trial opportunity should be given. As a result, it was decided that "this case will be sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for research and experimentation."</p>
<p>Regulations State That a Public Telephone Should Be Installed Within One Li</p>
<p>(4) The cases concerning the installation of tap water faucets were all merged and decided: Please the Public Utilities Bureau quickly handle the resolutions on supplying tap water to the civilian areas according to the resolutions of the previous conferences of the council, and hope to complete 30 water supply stations in the short term. (5) "Please the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau install public telephones in Zhabei and the four suburbs to benefit the citizens and consolidate security." The conference decided: The council will send a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation to forward it to expedite the handling, and ask the Shanghai Municipal Government to send a letter to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau. Method: It is proposed that the Telecommunications Bureau accept the requests of citizens to install public telephones as much as possible. If it is considered necessary after investigation, it shall not be used as an excuse that there are no empty lines, and it is stipulated that a public telephone shall be installed within one li. (6) The Telephone Company of this city often delays or does not respond to the application of telephone users to add extensions, resulting in prolonged call time and affecting user convenience. Resolution: Please the Telephone Company of this city make every effort to facilitate the installation of extensions for users in the future, and allow users to freely install extensions with their own suitable telephone sets. (7) The Bund Wharf in the Central District prohibits the berthing of cargo ships to improve the city's appearance and facilitate transportation. Resolution: Send a request to the municipal government to build wharfs and warehouses No. 10 to No. 18, move them within a time limit, and order motorized sailing ships to change their berthing to the Nanshi Wharf first. Method: Please the municipal government order the Public Utilities Bureau to re-stipulate from today that the wharfs on the Bund in the Central District are exclusively for public transportation, strictly prohibiting the berthing of cargo ships and the loading and unloading of goods, and stipulate that all ships loaded with fruits, chickens, ducks, fish, and fresh goods must change their berthing to the wharfs in the Shiliupu area for unloading.</p>
<h3>The Rabbit Dies, the Fox Grieves: Finance Bureau Staff Member Commits Suicide by Jumping into the River; Colleagues from Both Bureaus Donate to Help the Bereaved Family</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Hao, a staff member of the Finance Bureau, committed suicide by jumping into the river because his wife had been ill for more than two months and he saw that there was no hope of saving her. He could not afford to pay for her treatment, and he could not bear to witness the tragic scene of her taking her last breath.</p>
<p>The newspaper also reported that his wife's condition worsened because she had not seen her husband for days and was unable to speak. She had no one to take care of her, and it was difficult to even get a glass of water. When Yang Jusong, a specialist from the Social Bureau, read this tragic news, he was deeply moved and initiated a donation to the families of the victims. This proposal was immediately responded to by all colleagues in the Social Bureau. Director Wu Kaixian first donated one million yuan to show his approval, and all other colleagues also helped. The declaration drafted by the staff welfare society of the Social Bureau for this donation movement was quite painful: "We are all civil servants and have a sense of grief for the death of a rabbit, just like the death of a fox. Although we are as poor as Mr. Lu Hao, we are still struggling and can still struggle! We should give sympathy in spirit and assistance in material." The staff welfare society of the Social Bureau will collect this donation within days and send it to the families of the victims.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Lu was from Wu County, and his brother's name is Lu Ye.

<h3>Zhan Wenhun, National Assembly Representative, Transfers Qualification to Friendly Party Song Yimian; President Chiang Sends a Telegram to Commend Him</h3>
<p>Zhan Wenhun, General Manager of Xinwen Bao, was elected as the National Assembly Representative of professional journalists. Following the telegram from President Chiang of the Kuomintang, he has transferred the qualification of representative to Mr. Song Yiqing of the Youth Party.

As a result of the vote count, he was officially elected. However, in order to adapt to the political environment and smoothly promote constitutional government, the central government has decided to assist friendly parties in generating a certain number of seats, and journalists are also among the agreed-upon assisted seats. Zhan received a telegram from President Chiang of the Kuomintang on February 29 yesterday, instructing him to transfer the qualification of representative to Mr. Song Yiqing of the Youth Party, who was elected as an alternate representative, and to retreat to the alternate position.

I hope you cherish it." Zhan replied that he would obey the order to concede, stating in the telegram: "The central government has decided to assist journalist Song Yiqing, a member of the friendly party, in being elected as the National Assembly Representative of professional journalist groups through the party-to-party transfer method. Wenhun, as a member of the party, should obey the order to give way to the virtuous, so as to show the sincerity and trustworthiness of our party. In the future, I will continue to adhere to my position and strive to develop China's journalism, to repay the attention of His Excellency and to live up to the enthusiasm of colleagues."</p>

<h3>Singing "Picking Up Gold" and Trying to Be Enthusiastic Ends Up Being Unpleasant: Rehearsals in the Legal Circle Cause Trouble in the Court</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A dispute arose during the rehearsal of the lawyers' association on the evening of the 29th of last month.

Lawyer Fei Xizhen sang "The Sale of Horses," which was scheduled for the last performance. Because Wang performed with special enthusiasm, with various tunes and many items, Fei was worried that the time for "Picking Up Gold" would be too long, and the audience would be tired, affecting "The Sale of Horses." Fei was so anxious in the backstage that he was jumping up and down. Yu Zhongluo and Zhang Danping, two lawyers, signaled on stage to ask Wang to end it earlier.

<p>(1) If direct lottery is not permitted due to circumstances, a report may be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval to adopt an indirect lottery. (2) Indirect lottery methods are divided into two types: 1. If a small number of eligible men currently serving in the military are unable to attend the lottery in person, the district chief (保長) may draw the lottery on their behalf. 2. If a majority of eligible men currently serving in the military are unwilling to participate in direct lottery, or if they are indeed unable to attend the lottery in person due to circumstances, a representative of the Military Service Association may draw the lottery on their behalf (the indirect lottery referred to in these measures belongs to the latter). (3) In adopting an indirect lottery, the order of conscription procedures may be changed as follows: 1. Background investigation, 2. Lottery, 3. Physical examination, 4. Conscription into the association. (4) The indirect lottery shall be presided over by the mayor. (5) Before the lottery, the municipal government shall allocate the number of soldiers assigned for the year to each district and neighborhood unit (保) according to the population ratio, for the purpose of the lottery. (6) At the time of the lottery, the register of all eligible men in the city for military service, except for those who are exempt or deferred, shall be compiled by neighborhood unit, regardless of physical fitness level, and a roster of lottery numbers for eligible men currently serving in the military in each neighborhood unit shall be created for this year, numbered consecutively from the first number, with each number corresponding to a lottery ticket. The lottery tickets shall be supervised and sealed by the Military Service Association, and representatives shall affix their seals to them, and then hand them over to the mayor for safekeeping. (7) A register of the selected order (牌) of eligible men currently serving in the military in each neighborhood unit shall be compiled separately, and an equal number of bamboo lottery tickets shall be prepared. During the lottery, the Military Service Association shall draw the lottery on behalf of the individuals, and each ticket drawn shall be recorded in the register and displayed on the sequential plate, and sealed as before. (8) At the time of conscription, the mayor, together with a representative of the Military Service Association, shall open the roster of lottery numbers, and select one to two times the quota for each neighborhood unit in order to supplement those who fail the physical examination, which shall be counted as the number to be conscripted. Then, according to the roster of the selected names from each neighborhood unit, the first ticket drawn shall be the first selected person in each neighborhood unit, the second ticket drawn shall be the second selected person, and so on until the required number of conscripts for that neighborhood unit is reached. All names shall be transferred to the roster of conscripted men in each neighborhood unit. If a lottery number exceeds the number of people in that neighborhood unit, the sequentially recorded lottery numbers in the roster shall be used to fill the vacancies. (9) In addition to forwarding the roster of conscripted men to the districts to which the neighborhoods belong along with the conscription notices, a copy shall be submitted to the regimental headquarters for reference. Each district shall conduct conscription in accordance with the roster, and send the men for examination and enlistment in accordance with the order listed on the roster until the required number is met. Then, the original roster shall be publicly announced. If the number of men in a neighborhood unit is insufficient due to physical examination rejections, the district shall report to the municipal government, which shall then conduct a lottery in accordance with the previous method until the required number is met.</p>
<h3>United Power Plant Project, Agreement between Ministry of Economic Affairs and Municipal Government</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 2nd] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian recently went to Shanghai and discussed the Shanghai United Power Plant with Mayor Wu. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government have no disagreement in principle, and only technical discussions are needed before the project can begin. It is understood that Shanghai's electricity consumption is currently 200,000 kilowatts per month. Shanghai Electric Power Company generates 173,500 kilowatts, Zhabei Electric Power Company generates 9,000 kilowatts, French Electric Power Company generates 17,000 kilowatts, China Electric Power Company generates 1,440 kilowatts, and Pudong Electric Power Company generates 2,500 kilowatts. An additional 50,000 to 60,000 kilowatts are needed to meet the city's electricity demand. Before the establishment of the Shanghai United Power Plant, China Electric Power Company and Pudong Electric Power Company had already purchased equipment from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which will increase their power generation by 4,000 kilowatts each and is expected to be operational within a year. The equipment of the Zhabei Electric Power Company was damaged by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. It was sent to Czechoslovakia last year for repairs, which have been completed, and it can be shipped back to Shanghai. Once installed, it will start generating electricity and is expected to increase power generation by 10,000 kilowatts.</p>

<h3>Winners of Charity Houses Gradually Revealed, Ferry Driver Dares Not Believe It, Apprentice in Cotton Mill Working for Others</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the lottery for the Class B Charity House tickets, the names and identities of the fifty lucky winners have been gradually revealed since yesterday.</p>
<p>A driver from the city ferry company named Zhou Xincheng won a prize. Yesterday, when he saw the numbers published in the newspaper, he was hesitant to believe it. Early in the morning, he specially went to the housing charity sales group of the Winter Relief Association to check, and was delighted to find that it was indeed correct. His number is Di (帝) 01994.</p>
<p>Huang Guozhen, the Spinning Department director of Rongfeng Cotton Mill on Yidingpan Road, some time ago asked a young apprentice in the factory to buy several lottery tickets at a cigarette and paper store on Yidingpan Road. One of them, Wenzi (文字) 02841, actually won. The director of Rongfeng Cotton Mill felt that the young apprentice was lucky, so yesterday he specially sent him again to the housing charity sales group of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to buy a large number of Tianshi (田種) lottery tickets. When this young apprentice was buying the tickets, he talked about this matter, and another customer buying tickets next to him was greatly moved and also entrusted him to choose some numbers for him.</p>
<p>Xinxin Company held a big sale last winter and gave away housing charity sales tickets. Anyone who purchased goods worth 200,000 yuan could receive a ticket, and 20 giveaway tickets could be exchanged for one charity sales ticket. Fang Chengzhou, Zhu Rongzhuang, and Hong Wenda, three employees of the socks department, unintentionally accumulated 20 giveaway tickets and jointly exchanged them for a Yu (　) 01118 charity sales ticket. Unexpectedly, they actually won the prize, and they are already discussing how to divide it.</p>
<p>In addition, it has been confirmed that the winners also include Cao Fengtai, an employee of the China Culture Service Agency, seven employees of Lixin Accounting Firm (jointly purchased one ticket), and a Mr. Zhuang, an employee of the Land Administration Bureau, etc. All the employees of the housing charity sales group of the Winter Relief Association collectively bought more than 240 tickets, but none of them won. Among them, the tickets Zhong (重) 10269 and 10271 were both bought by them, but the winning ticket, 10270, was missing. It is said that this ticket, 10270, was bought by a woman on the morning of the lottery.</p>
<p>As for whether there are any winning tickets among the more than 90,000 unsold tickets, it was still unknown yesterday. This mystery will be revealed only after the remaining tickets are unsealed tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Three Steps to Claiming Prizes, Receiving Houses by the End of April</h3>
<p>Regarding the procedures for claiming prizes for Class B housing tickets, according to the person in charge of the housing charity sales department of the Winter Relief Association yesterday: For winners of Class B housing tickets, the first step is to personally bring the winning ticket to the housing charity sales department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification. The department will send personnel to verify the ticket against the stub and the perforation seal. After verification, if it is confirmed that the ticket was issued by the department, the association will issue a certificate. The second step is for the winner to present the certificate issued by the association and the winning ticket to the Winter Relief Association on the third floor of the Municipal Council on Tangshan Road from the 5th of this month to exchange for a house receipt certificate. This house receipt certificate has already been printed and is very beautiful and elegant. The third step is that the Class B houses will all be completed by the end of April. The locations are distributed in four places: 7 buildings at No. 1503 Zhongzheng West Road, 16 buildings on Linsen West Road, 11 buildings at No. 70 Wuyi Road, and 16 buildings at No. 7 Wuyi Road, totaling 50 buildings. The department will convene all the winners at the end of April to draw lots again to determine the houses they will receive.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Province Chairman Zhu Shaozhou Talks About Shaanxi Politics to Our Reporter</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Bureau Report, February 28th by air] It will be almost four years to the day, until March 3rd, since Shaanxi Province Chairman Zhu Shaozhou has been in charge of Shaanxi's administration. The provincial government's gate is being whitewashed and decorated, and Shaanxi officials will celebrate that day.</p>
<p>This morning, as agreed, we went to visit Chairman Zhu. The meeting place was in the provincial government building, which is also where Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek cautioned young Marshal Zhang eleven years ago during the "Xi'an Incident." Chairman Zhu's current office is where the Generalissimo, who was in distress, slept for several days.</p>
<p>For this interview, although we had prepared some questions in advance, the host had figured out what the reporters wanted to ask. Therefore, we did not need to ask, and he went on in one breath, his tone of voice revealing a very strong Jiangnan Hang County accent, and with confidence and firmness in his modesty and frankness. When he talked about the difficulties, the three wrinkles on his forehead were clearly visible. After all, he is fifty and a half years old, and half of his hair has turned white, but his rosy cheeks, strong muscles, and bright eyes prove that he is healthy and energetic. The topic started like this:</p>
<p>Stability and Finance</p>
<p>In the four years that I have been in charge of Shaanxi, I have always reviewed my gains and losses every anniversary to see how much of the central work has actually been done and how much has not been done. The first two years of the four years were during the Anti-Japanese War, and the last two years were during the suppression of the rebellion. I think the last two years were even more difficult than the first two years. There have been no major achievements in the past four years, but the local area is stable, both publicly and privately, and I can report [to superiors] with peace of mind. I have always believed that we must seek stability in turbulence and progress in hardship. Stability is the basic condition for progress...."</p>
<p>Under the general situation of inflation and austerity in government spending, provincial-level finance is undoubtedly difficult. Talking about the problem of money, Chairman Zhu talked about his methods like a gentle patriarch talking about family affairs: "I have a principle, that is, when money should be used, I will not hesitate to spend billions, and when it should not be used, I will not use even a penny." Saying this, he smiled and gestured before saying, "Let me give you an example. This year's Spring Festival labor army, we originally thought that 1 billion would be enough to distribute, but as a result, 2 billion was issued, and I still gritted my teeth and paid, because I thought it should be done."</p>
<p>"For another example, in the past, the savings of the various departments and offices of the provincial government had their own channels, and the interest rates were different. Later, I ordered them to be concentrated in the provincial bank, and on the other hand, I asked the provincial bank to increase the interest rate on the provincial government's deposits. Currently, we have public funds publicly deposited, income and expenses are open, and the interest that should be public is all turned over to the public..."</p>
<p>Working for the Hometown Next, he talked about the issue of "people":</p>
<p>"In recent years, we have been trying to promote young and outstanding local cadres, trying to let them work for their hometown, and not change because of the departure of superior officials. When I first took office, only one of the ten administrative commissioners in the province was a local person, and the other nine were from other provinces. Now the number of commissioners of local origin has increased to three. Furthermore, in the ninety-odd counties, at that time, there were only 20 county magistrates of [Shaanxi] origin, while now there are 40 or 50, that is, half of the total are of local origin. Now is a time of military affairs, and county magistrates must understand military affairs. Otherwise, the appointment of local people as local county magistrates can still be increased to seventy or eighty percent. Originally, employing people is like planting trees. Only local seedlings planted in local soil are easy to grow. Similarly, only when local cadres take root can all policies have a foundation. Until now, I have not had a single relative or friend in Shaanxi Province as a county magistrate..." As he spoke, he kept writing the character "人" (person) on the table with his finger to emphasize his emphasis on personnel, local cadres, and impartiality.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Government Affairs He replied to us, "The customs and folk customs of Shaanxi Province are very lovely. The farmers' naivety, simplicity, hard work, and endurance are especially rare. In the past, when I was in Hanzhong, I often went to the countryside in plain clothes to chat with the old farmers. The folks there all knew who I was, and we talked to each other as close as family. Now government affairs are a little busier than that time, but I still hope to talk with the Guanzhong farmers more, as I have for four years."</p>
<p>"Then, which aspect of government affairs has the chairman been most satisfied with in the past four years?" We asked.</p>
<p>"The first is water conservancy, and the second is anti-opium. If we had not worked hard to ban opium in the past few years, I am afraid that many people in Shaanxi would have already become opium addicts."</p>
<p>Next, we talked about the public security in various parts of the province, from Yulin, Yan'an, Guanzhong, and Southern Shaanxi to the borders of Sichuan and Hubei, because in addition to being the chairman of the province, he also serves as the commander of the province's security forces and the commander-in-chief of martial law. Unfortunately, another reporter from a certain newspaper happened to be there, taking notes of our conversation. The host seemed to have some concerns about this, and we did not want to raise other pre-planned questions. This interview came to an end. Here, we would like to add some statistical figures on construction aspects in the province over the past four years, because numbers are the most objective witnesses.</p>
<p>Ten Water Conservancy Channels First, we note the water conservancy. There are currently ten water conservancy channels in the province, with a total length of 885 kilometers of main canals, irrigating 1.34 million mu of land. Cotton production in the beneficiary area increased by 350,000 dan in the past year, with a total of 1.83 million dan in the past four years. Grain production in the beneficiary area increased by 2.4 million shi in the past year, with a total of 11.65 million shi in the past four years. Among the above-mentioned ten channels, the entire project of the Nonghui Canal and the [　]hui Canal, and most of the projects of the Hanhui Canal, Baohui Canal, Xuhui Canal, and Jinghui Canal, were completed in the most recent four years. In addition to irrigation canals, water conservancy and power generation projects and reservoir construction are being started or have been surveyed and planned. After four years of continuous exploration, they have attracted the attention of the whole country and the authorities, and are being gradually implemented. The most important ones are: (1) The Heihe Reservoir, all of which has been surveyed. In the future, the plan is to irrigate 400,000 mu of land and generate more than 50,000 horsepower of electricity, transmitting electricity as far as 100 kilometers. (2) The second Weihui Canal has been specially applied for construction funds by the Ministry of Water Resources and can be implemented immediately. (3) The Jinghe River upstream reservoir, which can irrigate 1 million mu of land, has been approved by the central government. (4) The Weihuo Baoji Gorge (Taibingu) Reservoir has more than 60,000 horsepower and irrigates 400,000 mu of land. (5) The Yumengkou Reservoir has 350,000 horsepower and can irrigate 2.5 million mu of land.</p>
<p>In addition, there are small-scale water conservancy projects. In the past four years, the cumulative total of benefited farmland has reached 2.5 million mu.</p>
<p>In terms of increased agricultural production: In the past four years, the promotion of improved wheat varieties has covered 2 million mu, increasing grain production by more than 18 million dan. During the same period, the promotion of improved cotton varieties has covered 8.18 million mu, increasing cotton production by 2.5 million dan. This has made an important contribution to the rural economy of the province and the domestic textile industry in recent years. (Our reporters Ma Ye and Zhang Xianzhou)</p>
<h3>Conscription in Jiangsu Province is Mainly by Lottery</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Bureau on the 1st] The Jiangsu Military Region Headquarters recently issued an order to the military service associations of various counties, stating: "In the past, the military service associations in various places requested that Jiangsu be a region where culture is concentrated, personnel changes are extremely complicated, and transportation is developed, and it is not easy to ascertain the changes in eligible men. Therefore, we specially requested to change this year's conscription method. After submitting it to the Ministry of National Defense for review and approval, it has been approved that the lottery must still be the main method, and voluntary participation may be used as a supplement when necessary." In addition to ordering the military service associations of various counties, the headquarters also notified the military service agencies at all levels.</p>

<h3>American Navy Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai - First Game Unfavorable - Loses to Qingbai by One Point</h3>
<p>Second Game Tonight Against</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Qingdao US Marine Corps McKinley basketball team, at the invitation of the Shanghai Basketball Committee, arrived in Shanghai by US Navy plane yesterday afternoon. That evening, they played their first game against Qingbai at the City Gymnasium, and the result was unfavorable, losing to Qingbai by a half-ball difference of 48 to 47. In the first half, Qingbai was behind 26 to 30. The game was quite tense, but the number of fans in the gymnasium was not crowded. McKinley's second game is tonight, starting at 8:30 PM, against the city champion Hualian, and there will be a fierce battle.</p>
<p>McKinley's Strength - Judging from last night's game, McKinley's strength is not that great, about the same as Qingbai. Some basic moves are very good, such as throwing under the basket and passing the ball, which are unique, but they are somewhat stiff and unfamiliar, and the defense is too sparse, which was also the reason for last night's failure. Tonight's game is unlikely to defeat Hualian. The best players in the team are forward Deng Bo and guard Lauterbach, who often have wonderful performances. Although last night's game was not very fast, it was clean and refreshing, without any procrastination, which was quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Game - The game was very tense in the second half. It adopted a four-quarter system. In the first quarter, Qingbai took the lead with 4 to 1, and the US military chased to 15 to 14, a difference of one point. In the second quarter, the score was tied twice, and the competition was fierce. The US military gradually surpassed, and finally took the lead with 30 to 26 in the first half. In the second half, McKinley was always in the lead, but the difference was not far. Qingbai chased hard, and in the third quarter, the score was 36 to 35, with Qingbai only one point behind. The last deciding quarter was extremely tense, with each team scoring one point alternately. In the last two minutes, Nan Zhenhu scored, making the score 44 to 43, with Qingbai one point ahead. Unexpectedly, the US military made a free throw, and Ah Cai scored miraculously, putting Qingbai ahead again. With 12 seconds left, Lauterbach made a free throw, and McKinley still lost by one point.</p>
<p>Second Game Against Hualian - The US military McKinley team will play its second game tonight, starting at 8:30 PM, still at the gymnasium, against the city champion Hualian. Tickets are 30,000 yuan upstairs, 60,000 yuan downstairs, and 100,000 yuan for reserved seats in the venue. Reserved seats will be pre-sold starting at 10:00 AM in the gymnasium accounting office, and ordinary seats will be sold starting at 5:00 PM. Due to the badminton competition, the gate will open at 7:30 PM, and reserved seats will enter the barbed wire fence at 8:00 PM.

<p>Also News: Yesterday, the rice market continued to decline due to three reasons: (1) The rice coupons in the Yulin area have been sold. After the rice shops sell the household rice, the retail sales turn slack; (2) The Lantern Festival has passed, and the villagers have begun their spring plowing work. At this high price, the villagers sell them to exchange for other needed items, so the arrivals see surge; (3) The price in Wuxi sees lower again; All of these make the rice market decline.</p>
<p>Flour - Fell first and then rose, but still fell in the end. The morning opening was due to the continued decline in rice prices, people's minds are still unstable, the main holders were afraid of falling again, and were eager to sell, but the buyers were still watching.

Finally, the old car was 1.2 million yuan. Bran rose after falling, similar to the previous day. The publicly allocated wheat price was 1.89 million yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains - Lower in the morning and firm in the afternoon. The quoted price of soybeans in the producing area did not fall back, and it has become an upside-down image. In the harsh environment, it is not easy to cheer up. Those who are tight on funds in the same industry have to sell at a loss. The northern gang of corn has been moving for a long time and wants to be quiet. The Qidong corn has decreased by another 100,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang of sesame seeds is moving, and this street does not absorb it. The Jiujiang milk sesame seeds have fallen by 15% compared with yesterday. Raw kernels are down 250,000 yuan, and red grains are down about 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil - The initial market continued to decline, and the later market rose steadily. Finally, the price of soybean oil was higher than the previous day.

In the early market, the factory opened soybean oil, with Dayou opening 600-700 dan with a surplus of 5.35 million, and other factory soybean oil openings were also high.

<h3>Textile and Construction Allocation Prices Still High - Cotton Yarn and Cloth Price Increase Wind Rises Again - 42-count Blue Phoenix Returns to 16 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market, due to the excessive decline in the price the day before, aroused the street and customer gangs to absorb at low prices, and yarn merchants also had activities, and the shorts made profits to offset, and the yarns regained momentum. The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was 100.6 million yuan, and some people absorbed it. Afterwards, it rose to 118 million yuan at the close, an increase of 16 million yuan compared with the previous day.

In addition, 20-count, 16-count, 10-count and other coarse yarns have also returned to the show by 10%. Yesterday's cotton cloth market was also the period for the allocation of textile and construction companies.

<h3>Another Reunion: A Movie Script (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Daoluo</p>
<p>28. The Zheng Family's Shanghai Residence</p>
<p>Outside the Door (October, Year 35)</p>
<p>In front of the Zheng family's old Shanghai residence at 918 Ferguson Road. A car carrying Jingye, Xiuzhen, and their luggage (a small leather suitcase, a cloth travel bag) arrives at the gate of Jingye's old Shanghai home. Jingye directs the car to stop. He gets out first to check the house number and looks around. It seems the same as before. Only then does he press the doorbell without hesitation. A woman of about fifty comes to open the door. This woman is Jingye's sister-in-law, Mrs. Zheng (Mrs. Zheng is now about forty-seven or forty-eight years old.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Initially only opens the door a small crack, looking out and asking) Who are you?</p>
<p>Jingye: Is this the Zheng residence?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Yes, who are you looking for?</p>
<p>Jingye: (Now seeing clearly that it is his sister-in-law.) Aren't you my sister-in-law?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Suddenly opens the door wide.) Ah! Sister, it's you!</p>
<p>Jingye: Hey! None of you came to pick me up at the airport. The place names in Shanghai have changed so much, I almost couldn't find my way home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Who knew you were arriving today!</p>
<p>Jingye: Didn't you receive my telegram?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: No! Come in quickly, the servants can take care of the luggage.</p>
<p>Jingye: (Smiling at his sister-in-law.) I have another piece of "living" luggage! (Mrs. Zheng looks puzzled. Jingye walks to the car and opens the door.) Xiuzhen, get out!</p>
<p>(Xiuzhen, holding a coat, gets out of the car, looking a little shy as she sees Mrs. Zheng. Everyone goes inside together, closing the door behind them. They arrive in the living room.)</p>
<p>29. The Zheng Family's Living Room</p>
<p>The living room of Zheng Jingye's old Shanghai residence. The furnishings are quite elaborate. There are lifelike portraits, exquisite old-fashioned rosewood carved furniture, as well as modern sofas and chairs. The walls are hung with works by famous calligraphers and painters. Although eight years of war have passed, it seems the family has not suffered any upheaval or loss.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Sister, is this your...?</p>
<p>Jingye: Xiuzhen, this is my sister-in-law, Mrs. Zheng, you can call her Aunt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (Saying jokingly) I thought she should call me Auntie!</p>
<p>Jingye: (Looks at his sister-in-law with a smile, but a hint of anger.) Sister-in-law, don't talk nonsense!</p>
<p>This is an orphan I adopted in Guiyang. Her parents originally lived in Shanghai. I hope she can find her parents here, so she can have a home to return to.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Ah! Sister, why did you only come back a year after the victory?</p>
<p>Jingye: There are many people in the rear, who knows when they will return!</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Sister, you haven't changed at all, you are even more beautiful than before.</p>
<p>Jingye: You haven't aged either.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: My hair is already streaked with white, how can I not be old!</p>
<p>Jingye: Oh! Where is my brother?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: I was just about to tell you, he went to Tianjin in May.</p>
<p>Jingye: What did he go to Tianjin for?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Friends invited him to handle a railway project. Sister, are you tired?</p>
<p>Take Xiuzhen upstairs to wash your face and rest for a while. I'll prepare some tea and snacks, and we can have a good chat. (Continued from the previous installment of this publication, issue 12.) 36. In Front of the Zheng Residence</p>
<p>The day after Xiuzhen returned home, Canyun and Xiuzhen brought many gifts to Jingye's house to express their gratitude.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: (After opening the door) Ah, Xiuzhen, Mrs. He, it's you! Please come in. (Everyone walks into the living room together.)</p>
<p>37. The Zheng Family's Living Room</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Mrs. He, please sit down.</p>
<p>Canyun: (Places the gifts on the table, saying to Mrs. Zheng) These small gifts are from Xiuzhen to Mrs. Zheng and your sister.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Oh! You are too kind. Xiuzhen, you actually give gifts!</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Aunt, where is Mr. Zheng?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: He is upstairs, not feeling very well.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: I'll go ask him to come down. (Runs upstairs.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Mrs. He, your daughter is truly lovely. My sister has taken care of her for two years, so naturally, she has developed feelings for her. Now that she has returned home, my sister can't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>Canyun: Oh! I am truly sorry to your sister. I will often send Xiuzhen to visit her in the future. From everything Xiuzhen told me last night, I also know that your sister truly loves Xiuzhen. Without your sister adopting her, I'm afraid this child would have died long ago. Mrs. Zheng, is your sister not married yet?</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: No.</p>
<p>Canyun: Let me introduce someone to her. I think she can definitely be a good wife and mother. When she has her own children, she will have a spiritual anchor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: My sister is a bit different from other women. All day long, she only talks about academics and careers, but I never hear her talk about marriage.</p>
<p>(Xiuzhen pulls Jingye into the living room. Jingye greets Canyun. After everyone sits down.)</p>
<p>Canyun: Mr. Zheng, Xiuzhen has told me how you saved her, how you treated her wounds, how you cared for her, and educated her. We can never repay your kindness. (Laughs to herself first)</p>
<p>Now that I think about wanting to send you a reward yesterday, it was really ridiculous. I hope you will forgive me.</p>
<p>Jingye: (A kind of proud smile.) It's nothing.</p>
<p>Canyun: Xiuzhen, what are you doing? Have you forgotten?</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Mr. Zheng, my mother wants to invite you and Aunt to our house for dinner tomorrow.</p>
<p>Jingye: Mrs. He, you don't have to be so polite, I have something to do tomorrow evening and cannot go.</p>
<p>Canyun: Xiuzhen's father has gone to Hong Kong, otherwise, he would have come together today to thank you and invite you. If you have something to do tomorrow, how about changing it to the day after tomorrow?</p>
<p>Jingye: Please don't be so polite, I never really like social engagements.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen: Mr. Zheng, you said you would definitely come to my house to see me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng: Sister, just agree!</p>
<p>Jingye: (Smiles at Xiuzhen.) Just once! (To Canyun.) Alright, Mrs. He, let it be the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Canyun: I am extremely happy that you are willing to grace us with your presence. (To Mrs. Zheng.) Mrs. Zheng, you can't not come the day after tomorrow. Xiuzhen, let's go home. (The He mother and daughter bid farewell.) The He family's living room. It is just after dinner, and all the guests are walking into the living room from the dining room. The hosts are naturally Canyun and Xiuzhen. In addition to Zheng Jingye and Mrs. Zheng, there are also two female guests and five male guests, who are obviously modern figures. After everyone enters the living room one after another, some sit down by themselves, and some stand together in twos and threes talking; Mrs. He pays attention to taking care of the guests.</p>
<p>Canyun: (To Jingye.) Mr. Zheng, please sit down.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Lin Ye</p>
<p>— A Story of a Pair Wandering in Annam</p>
<p>The day after disembarking, the eldest brother followed a fellow villager, Ma Zi, who was purchasing local goods, and moved into the inn. He had some money with him, so he was willing to partner with that fellow villager, and at the same time, he hoped to learn some experience from him. Honest eldest brother, he trusts others even more than he trusts himself.</p>
<p>After resting for a few days, they set off again; this time they were going to walk from Saigon to Phnom Penh to purchase goods. Phnom Penh is famous for producing pepper, and they hoped to buy cheap pepper there and then transport it back.</p>
<p>Although Phnom Penh is not as large as Saigon, it is very densely populated, and its products are not only abundant but also a distribution center for goods. The residents believe in ghosts and gods, and their tricks of sorcery are comparable to those of Siam. One can often see teams of natives wearing strange costumes, beating large leather drums, humming crude melodies, swaggering through the streets, and in lively places, they use sharp iron bars to pierce their lips or noses without any concern. This action frightened the eldest brother, but in Ma Zi's eyes it was commonplace.</p>
<p>They first browsed the streets, and at the same time inquired about the market prices of pepper and other spices. Ma Zi liked to drink the local liquor and chew areca nuts with a strong smell, but the eldest brother had no such habits. When entering and exiting restaurants, he only needed a cup or two of coffee and a few local cigarettes. The days passed too quickly, and after a week of meaningless life, the eldest brother began to feel bored. He urged Ma Zi almost every day to hurry up and get the goods ready so he could go back. Ma Zi also became worried, the romantic and unrestrained hobbies had taken away half of his capital, but he could not immediately tell the eldest brother, he only pretended to be careful and said:</p>
<p>"The price of goods is too high, they are simply cheating us merchants from outside. Let's look again, and buy when it is suitable."</p>
<p>An unexpected thing happened: One day, near dusk, they were wandering on the street? A short, thin middle-aged man ran over, seeming very clever, and said:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, are you buying spices? I'll introduce you, the one across the street is particularly cheap, they have always been known for their honesty."</p>
<p>The eldest brother and Ma Zi did as he said and went to look for it. The spice shop did not have a sign, only half of the storefront was open, and it was gloomy inside, and not a single figure could be seen. They looked around and saw several bags of pepper piled on the floor, as well as various spices scattered on the ground; cobwebs were formed on the roof and corners of the walls, showing that it had not been cleaned for a long time. Ma Zi became impatient and deliberately coughed a few times, at which time there were a few echoes of wooden clogs dragging from inside the shop. A gorgeously dressed lady came out with delicate steps, she impolitely first looked them both up and down, and then spoke in not very proficient Cantonese (Note 1) and asked:</p>
<p>"What do you want to buy?"</p>
<p>So Ma Zi began to discuss the price with her, only the eldest brother stood silently aside, admiring her attire. He had been in Annam for almost two months, but he had never paid attention to the attire of the local ladies, so he looked at her with surprised eyes: She had a slender, black hair that dragged all the way to her knees, and a few white orchids that were not yet in full bloom were inserted into her temples. She wore a pink cheongsam, which was split all the way from the hem to the hips, revealing her soft white long pants. There was also a string of glowing beads around her neck, but her feet were bare, only wearing a pair of wooden clogs... It really felt like a unique sight. The eldest brother seemed to be fascinated by her.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, Ma Zi was satisfied, because the price here was indeed one-third cheaper than the market. However, their transaction was not immediately successful, she asked Ma Zi to come again the next afternoon.</p>
<p>The eldest brother followed Ma Zi back, on the road he mentioned that young boss lady to Ma Zi, and his heart could not help but ripple with desire. The next day, the eldest brother was indeed a little impatient to wait, he did not wait until the afternoon and went alone first.</p>
<p>The light in the spice shop was still as dim, and all the equipment was the same as yesterday, the gorgeously dressed boss lady was already waiting at the door of the shop before the eldest brother arrived, she saw the eldest brother and said bluntly:</p>
<p>"I guessed that you would come alone, that Ma Zi is really annoying, otherwise it would save you another trip!"</p>
<p>Later, they chatted very congenially, and the eldest brother simply told some of his experiences, at this time, he was already intoxicated in her coquetry.</p>
<p>It turned out that this girl who understood Cantonese was a widow, she had been living alone since her husband died five years ago; living on her husband's inheritance and selling spices. Her stiff and not fluent Cantonese was learned from her husband; because he was also a Cantonese. The life of a widow made her feel endless pain, she could not continue to waste her youth. Therefore, she took advantage of the darkness to move to the eldest brother's side, knelt down and hugged his leg, crying and asking to live with him. The eldest brother seemed to agree without thinking.</p>
<p>The sudden event made Ma Zi shed a few tears of excessive joy: the eldest brother not only did not demand the money he had invested with him, but he also got a lot of spices from the boss lady. However, the boss lady made a condition, asking him to keep it a secret after returning, and not let the eldest brother's family know his address...</p>
<p>The days passed too quickly, and it had been five years. Ma Zi, who was addicted to tobacco and alcohol and greedy for money, although he constantly traveled back and forth to transport spices, but he did not get rich as a result.</p>
<p>The eldest brother was much more haggard, living like a senseless hermit in the spice shop that was as dark as before. Since living with her, he had not left the narrow door of the shop, he could not see the sky, and lived in the foul air all year round. However, her appearance and demeanor were still as beautiful, but in the rat's nest-like house, her dress looked very discordant. In the dim light, she did not think that her盛裝 would lose its beautiful effect, on the contrary, she thought it would be better that way. Every day, she spent her time on dressing up, steaming and cooking, sleeping... Occasionally, one or two customers would come to the door, but she thought this was annoying. Inside the house, there was an altar, the incense candles never stopped burning morning and night, and she spent most of her time praying and kneeling. The eldest brother never interrupted these things, his mind never had a clear day.</p>
<p>The second brother and his mother still lived in the small village near the sea, they looked forward to news of the eldest brother day and night, every time a sea ship docked, they always went to inquire with a hopeful heart, but every time they always went back with knitted eyebrows and frustration. The elderly mother's hair had turned white waiting, the second brother supported the family with his strong body, gently comforted his mother, and at the same time he secretly made a wish to travel across the ocean to find his brother.</p>
<p>The second brother's determination was finally realized, and as a result of his hard work, the savings in his purse were enough to maintain his mother's living expenses for more than two years.</p>
<p>The old woman with a head full of silver hair gave the second brother even greater hope, she no longer made any more beautiful ideals; as long as their family could be reunited and enjoy family happiness again, she would be satisfied.</p>
<p>Time passed really fast, the second brother had been wandering in Annam for more than half a year inquiring about news of the eldest brother, he had traveled all over several famous big cities, following merchants selling goods to visit along the way, and finally came to Phnom Penh. The hardship of the journey did not discourage him, on the contrary, in every inch of time he always felt that there was a possibility of meeting the eldest brother. He prayed devoutly, asking for the enlightenment of the gods to help him realize his wish. Every time he arrived at a place, he inquired door-to-door along the streets and alleys... With sincerity and courage overflowing, he finally suddenly met the long-hidden Ma Zi. The second brother patiently inquired with him, the cunning Ma Zi thought this was an opportunity that was beneficial to him, so he spoke a long set of ambiguous words in a roundabout way, and as a result, he got a considerable reward as he wished before revealing the news that had been buried for five or six years.</p>

<h3>Zimo's Diary</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhimo's posthumous works, compiled by Chen Congzhou</p>
<p>October 11th, 3 am, the armistice news came, at that time the whole country was ecstatic, and the heaven and earth moved, Liming Daohong arranged it to report, so he hurried to the market, and everyone shook hands to celebrate, firecrackers blared, children gathered to raise fire, and some drummed on copper pots to make noise; national flags, large and small, were in the millions, and towards the dawn they were gradually bright and colorful. Several women also beat instruments to help make noise, and some wore paper on their heads and jumped and shouted; colored paper fell like snowflakes, the market town was in front of each other and thunderously, and the road was blocked, and many broken utensils were dragged at the end of the car, making the ground sound. This is what I saw in the morning.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I took a leave of absence from class and went out with Daohong, but I couldn't find a house. At two o'clock, it began to rain, and by the time it stopped, it was already crowded. There were no men or women at home, and everyone, young and old, went out to watch the meeting. Shoulders were crowded together, like the initial surge of the tide. After that, the guards cleared the way, and public and private groups came in sequence, all ten thousand people, I can't remember; the main ones were the army, the police, the students, the Women's Red Cross, the Relief National Bank, the factory, and even the black slaves, and the Qiao dressed as Indians. Generally, they all competed to show off, thinking it was colorful; uniforms and holding flags were common, and those who were handsome cut paper to make decorations or painted their faces; not only the children were like this, but also the gentry and officials were so playful. There were also those who imitated the German Emperor's war crimes, and falsely called it, and shouted to express the joy of victory and to wish for peace. They blew panpipes and drums to harmonize with the music and songs. The old man with white hair and beard also put on colorful streamers to make fun, and the lame man walked limping, completely forgetting his suffering. The young women all wore their hair loose and danced like demons, doing their best to be charming, and the long procession continued for two miles. At that time, heaven and earth opened up, and the wind and clouds cleared, to frolic and comfort the sincere and brave patriotic spirit. Alas! The eternal lessons of the demons and the infinite boundaries of democracy, the blood of the soldiers will not be in vain!</p>
<p>Jingzhong: (Pulls up a chair and sits down.)</p>
<p>Female A: Mr. Zheng, you have really done a boundless deed of merit. Mr. He and Mrs. He only have this one precious daughter (pointing at Xiuzhen). If you hadn't brought Xiuzhen back to them, they wouldn't know how to live their lives!</p>
<p>Jingye: Things in the world are really coincidental. If it weren't for my sister-in-law accidentally seeing the advertisement in the newspaper, we wouldn't have been able to know where Mrs. He and the others were.</p>
<p>Male A: That's true. I read the newspaper every day, but I didn't see their advertisement.</p>
<p>(Just at that time. He Qi - He Qi is now forty-two or forty-three years old - suddenly ran into the living room, carrying a small suitcase in his hand.)</p>
<p>He Qi: Hello! You're all here! (Jingye had already seen He Qi clearly, but He Qi had not yet noticed her; Jingye immediately stood up and turned around to look at the paintings on the wall, and He Qi had not yet seen his daughter.) Canyun, where's Xiuzhen? Your telegram wasn't lying to me, was it? (At this moment, Xiuzhen is in a corner of the living room. Male guest B is hiding Xiuzhen with his body. Xiuzhen is secretly looking at He Qi behind him.) (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Only After the Cold Season Do We Know the Pine and Cypress Are Last to Wither</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xiao</p>
<p>Why bother to compete with flowers and plants for a moment of splendor</p>
<p>Showing off laughter is not worthy of envy</p>
<p>Let it be sunshine or snow, it's the same</p>
<p>Steadfastly seeking purity and self-appreciation</p>
<p>Even without unrestrained singing</p>
<p>Never giving way to fearful frustration</p>
<p>Wind and snow may devastate active life</p>
<p>Facing wind and snow is precisely the forging of an unyielding soul</p>
<p>How many times have you endured sarcasm: ignorant of the times</p>
<p>Inherently difficult to encounter true numbness and stubbornness</p>
<p>Speculation and opportunism cannot withstand the elimination of power</p>
<p>Integrity and standing out from the crowd will exist for a long time beyond time</p>
<p>Let it be sunshine or snow, it's the same</p>
<p>Steadfastly happy to be pure and self-appreciative</p>
<p>Competing for beauty, flowers and plants will be colorful and crazy for a while</p>
<p>Let the wind, rain, frost, and snow still allow the pine and cypress to grow strongly</p>
<p>When the north wind fiercely shakes the earth</p>
<p>When the ice and snow drown out the songs of birds</p>
<p>When the severe cold locks people's thoughts</p>
<p>As long as you and I cannot forget to visit</p>
<p>Let them think that he has already died</p>
<p>Let them drink a glass of bitter wine around the stove</p>
<p>Let them sigh: When will spring come again</p>
<p>As long as you and I cannot forget to visit</p>
<p>Those prosperous and peaceful days have passed early</p>
<p>Let the bustling people return quickly</p>
<p>Today what you and I want to worship is the fighter</p>
<p>When others have all retreated, fallen, and died</p>
<p>Only he stands in the sharp north wind</p>
<p>Using his angular bones to resist the heavy pressure of ice and snow</p>
<h3>Recent World Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Balchin's New Work</p>
<p>Nigel Balchin of England was a novelist who gained attention during the war. He was born in Wiltshire in 1908. He has written several novels: "No Sky" (1933), "Simple Life" (1934), "Income and Outcome" (1936), "Darkness Falls from the Alr" (1942), "The Small Back Room" (1943), and so on.</p>
<p>But recently he wrote a play, "Lord, I Was Afraid." This is a difficult task. He tried to summarize the life, thoughts, and successes of the entire British era, showing how it went into the world, and explaining its process and end. This is a long script, and it can also be said to be a biographical depiction of the era. He has a first-class mind, is honest, and has very clear observations. The era he wrote about is the era when he was born in 1908, and he used seven different characters to represent it. They came out of school, went through wars, and opposed Hitler. They have the advantages and disadvantages of the era.</p>
<p>The author uses a high degree of imagination to write about the experiences of these seven people through allegorical scenes. This script is almost like poetry. The characters made sacrifices for concepts, almost like puppets, not like living people, but the concepts are very enthusiastic and clear, not only like being illuminated under a microscope, but also like being burned. The script also shines with the brilliance of "wit," with a bit of "irony."</p>
<p>Henry Reed once made some criticisms of Balchin's works in "The Novel Since 1939." He said that war is a nightmare, and reading war novels is just sharing nightmares, but Balchin's novels are not like that. His "Darkness Falls from the Alr" and "The Small Back Room" were both written in the National Service Office during the war. He has the ability to control many characters, the structure is tight, and the dialogue is natural. "The Small Back Room" is the most popular, writing about researchers in a scientific war research laboratory arguing and jealous over trivial matters, resulting in failure, and also writing about their desire to break the secret of the German fool's trap. He wrote it in a tense, interesting, and moving way, but unfortunately it is not original and has no future. But later he wrote "Mine own Executioner" (1945), which did not have this shortcoming. He used all dialogue to say that a psychoanalyst not only faces the difficult problems of patients, but also cannot cure his own failed love.</p>
<p>English Translation of Chinese Literature</p>
<p>I have previously introduced the English translation of Fan Chengda's poems. Recently, I learned that Lin Yutang has written a biography of Su Dongpo, called "The Gay Genius." Su Shi was four hundred years earlier than Da Vinci and seven hundred years earlier than Franklin. This book aroused the interest of Americans, even the most trivial descriptions are included, such as: Su Dongpo snoring, combing his hair a hundred times every morning, using a bamboo brush made of rat bristles to paint, his friends and enemies, his love affair with Chao Yun, and so on.</p>
<p>We know that Giles has translated "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio." Now we know that Rose Quong has also newly translated "Chinese Ghost and Love Stories." People who have always compiled "World Short Story Selections" only knew that Liao Zhai was the representative of Chinese short stories, but before and after the victory, Chinese new literature introduced more of the past. A recently published "World Short Story Selection" has taken Lu Xun, Lin Yutang, and others as representatives of Chinese novels. Naturally, there is still a bit of estrangement here, because Lin Yutang does not write short stories very much. He only occasionally writes novels in English. He writes almost only essays in Chinese.</p>
<p>Robert Payne of England selected and translated a "Contemporary Chinese Poetry," which includes Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo, He Qifang, Feng Zhi, Bian Zhilin, Zang Kejia, and Tian Jian. Each poet is also attached with a brief biography. Payne had lived in China for many years.</p>
<p>Occasionally flipping through "China of Tomorrow," Volume 4, I learned that Cranmer Bying published "Three Hundred Poems of the Tang Dynasty" in the Oriental Wisdom Series.</p>
<p>Arthur Waley selected and translated a "Chinese Poems," most of which are his old translations, and a small part are new translations. It is from about the tenth century to the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Payne also co-translated "Chinese Short Stories" with Yuan ChiaHua, which includes works by Lao She, Yang Zhensheng, Shi Zhicun, Shen Congwen, Zhang Tianyi, and Duanmu Hongliang. The preface mentions the Western influence they received, and also includes biographies of each writer, but the reviewer said that these authors' works have good skills and touching power, and they really have their own characteristics.</p>

<h3>A Record of Plum Blossom Viewing at Chao Mountain</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>In February of the 37th year of the Republic of China, during the Lantern Festival of the old lunar calendar, Hu, Wang, and the other gentlemen agreed to go to Hangzhou to see the plum blossoms at Chao Mountain. There were eight people in total. They arrived in Hangzhou on that day and first visited Gushan, as the introduction to this short essay. The sparse few plum trees on Gushan were not enough to encourage our interest in traveling. The next morning, we hired a large car, and learned that there were fifty kilometers from Hangzhou to Chao Mountain, heading northeast, out of Hangzhou city, following the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, along Hangzhou Bay, about thirty kilometers, to Qiaosi Station, turning left, and entering the Hangtang Highway. Here, looking west, it leads directly to Tanglou. The terrain gradually changes from plains to "sparse mountainous land" (I have been walking in this area for a long time. I call all mountains that are separated and where the plains are more than the mountainous land as "sparse mountainous land"; if the mountainous land is more than the plains, I call it "dense mountainous land"). We stopped the car at the foot of the mountain six li away from Tanglou (according to the locals). The mountain forms two wings. Walking less than a few dozen steps, there is a sea of ​​plum blossoms, some white, some red, some green, and most of them white. In the middle is an old plum tree, surrounded by a short fence. Two branches extend diagonally, one of which is dead, and one branch is divided into upper and lower branches. The flowers are white and in full bloom. Judging from the bark and bones, it shows a very old age. A wooden sign next to the tree is labeled Song Plum. The petals also have five petals, the same as ordinary ones, but the posture is simple and lovely. Those traveling with us took photos of each other under it.</p>
<p>Next to the vast plum field, there is a pavilion called Song Plum Pavilion, built by Zhou Mengpo in the autumn of the third year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Wuchang Uprising was about to break out, and the people in the mountains probably did not know it. The plum field is behind the Bao'en Temple, and it is the property of the temple. Entering the temple, there are inscriptions by Lin Qin'nan and poems by Kang Youwei on the walls, all about magnifying the Song Plum. I felt that they did not scratch the itch. After asking the locals in detail, I learned that the mountains in this area, close to Tanglou, are all suitable for fruit trees. Tangqi is originally famous for producing sugarcane, and it is said to be the most affluent area in Zhejiang Province. Even in terms of plums, the temple has two hundred plum trees, each of which can harvest fifty catties of plums. In good years, it can harvest more than one hundred dan, which are made into candied plums, half plums, and windy and rainy plums. They can all get high prices in the market. I don't know when the planting of fruit trees in this area began, but since it is suitable for the soil, it must have been very long ago. The monks in the temple even casually pointed to a tree in the courtyard as Tang Plum, but it was not mentioned by the famous scholars, so how could we know that the so-called Song Plum was not casually pointed out by the monks in the temple many years ago? The ancient Tang Plum in Santai, Sichuan, is also unknown based on what, and I am afraid it is similar to this. Monk Hongxiu in the temple asked me to write a poem, so I wrote a seven-character ancient poem.</p>
<p>I once viewed the ancient Tang Plum in Santai, and only today did I come to Chao Mountain, which I have known for a long time. The clear sky wants to be dizzy with a sheet of snow, the single branch is old but still in bloom. This mountain is suitable for plums and the soil is special, and the mountain people make a living and are free from hunger. One or two remain from eight or nine hundred years ago, making tourists think of the Zhao Song dynasty. The Tang Plum and Song Plum have become rare, and the six-petal shape of the legend is gradually becoming non-existent. This flower is simple and ancient and has been saturated with mulberry fields and seas, and outside the mountain today there is a clamor of gold and copper.</p>
<p>Based on my reasoning, the soil is suitable for fruit trees, and the mountain people mostly rely on fruit trees for a living (not only sugarcane and plums, but other fruits are also suitable). This custom must have been passed down from ancient times. I do not doubt that there were no plum blossoms in this area during the Song Dynasty, but I dare not believe that the plum tree labeled Song Plum is definitely a product of the Song Dynasty. After finishing the meal in the temple, we took sedan chairs to visit the Haiyun Cave of the Qianyuan Temple, circling around the mountain from west to south to east. Along the hillside were all plum fields, walking in the winding tens of thousands of flowers, to Baimao Slope, when a guest suddenly shouted loudly that a six-petal plum had been discovered. Sure enough, there were not only six petals, but also seven petals and eight petals. It was definitely single-petal, not double-layered. My nose also told me that I had smelled enough, so I took advantage of the sun before it went down the mountain and returned.</p>
<p>On the third day, we drank tea at the Sizhao Building of the Xiling Seal Society, and suddenly discovered six-petal plums under the Yangxian Pavilion again.</p>
<p>Those who traveled with me were Hu Juewen, Shen Fangcheng, Wang Youben, Zou Kang, Zheng Lingyu, Yao Weijun, and Huang Dangshi.</p>
<h3>New Year's Riddle Guessing</h3>
<p>— Sheng Juncai</p>
<p>Two days after the Lantern Festival, as the lights were lit, the auditorium of the Bank of China on the Bund of this city had a unique gathering. It was hosted by the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Friendship Association, and attended by five or six hundred male and female members of the association. The program included Cantonese music, drama, harmonica, dance, and singing, as well as a riddle guessing game sponsored by the Banking and Money Industry Newspaper, which was the most distinctive. In advance, the newspaper invited several experienced riddle makers to make literary riddles for the members to guess, and prepared gifts to add to the fun. It happened to be raining that day, and the writer went there by invitation. I saw dozens of riddles written in red and green paper banners hanging high in front of the "riddle increase," a dazzling array that was pleasing to the eye. The writer toured around and only guessed two riddles: one said "traffic lights," guessing a name from the Three Kingdoms, the answer being "Guan Lu"; the other said "sea," guessing a banking and money industry term, the answer being "exchange rate." In addition, there was a riddle that said "the whole family is in the west wind," guessing two solar terms. The writer wrote "White Dew" and "Lesser Cold," but the revealed answer was "Greater Cold" and "Lesser Cold." The riddle used the words "greater" and "lesser" to highlight the whole family. The writer only thought about the four words "in the west wind," so it was appropriate that only half of it was correct. There was also a riddle that said "two horses assist the father," guessing the name of a store in this city. The writer racked his brains but couldn't figure it out, so I tried to guess "Ma Dunhe" (teaching and making peace is interpreted as encouraging harmony), who knew the answer was "Fengliaoxing." The other riddles were also quite wonderful. Here are a few excerpts from my memory for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts: (1) Paper, ink, brush, and inkstone (guessing a character) sell; (2) Never in pairs at night (guessing a banking and money industry term, word splitting) many singles; (3) Perhaps (guessing the name of a bank, curtain roll style) China; (4) Having a receipt but no conscience (guessing a character) silver; (5) Repeatedly declining (guessing a name from the Three Kingdoms) Lu Xun; (6) One person above, ten people below, two villains embracing left and right (guessing the name of a bank) Da Lai; (7) First write a stroke, then write a horizontal line (guessing a character) pregnant; (8) Banishing the husband outside the door (guessing a place name) Niangziguan; (9) Model Village (guessing a place name) Liangxiang; (10) Saying good things (guessing a character) who; (11) Precious youth (guessing two lines of a Song poem) Mo Di idly wasted his youthful head; (12) If you want to deepen your skills, grind an iron pestle into a needle (guessing the name of a bank) Hengli.</p>
<h3>A Genuine Writer</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>An American novelist is known for his serious and genuine writing attitude. He always personally experiments with any plot before writing it. Once, in order to describe the feeling of starving to death, he imitated Gandhi and fasted for several days, almost starving to death. One day, he suddenly pondered for a whole day, restless, and ended up shooting himself. His wife examined his unfinished posthumous works and found that the last paragraph was written like this: "The emperor just got out of the car, and suddenly, a bullet pierced his head."</p>
<h3>"School Shop"? "School Temple"?</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Today, people mostly regard schools as school shops, thinking that school authorities only know how to collect tuition fees to fill their own pockets, and their behavior is quite similar to that of immoral merchants, so they are called school shops, and the principals are school shop owners, and schools are places to sell knowledge, not institutions for educating young people. In many schools in big cities, there are inevitably bad behaviors of "seeking profit at the expense of capital" or "misleading young people," and being called shops seems to be their own fault.</p>
<p>Now commerce has the distinction between private, provincial, and state-run, and school shops are no exception, so there are also private, provincial (municipal), and national distinctions. However, people generally call schools school shops, and the purpose is entirely to satirize and condemn the school authorities. In my opinion, if our schools really become genuine and valuable school shops, the results would not be bad. The seriousness of the current situation and the pessimism of the phenomenon lie not in the fact that schools are "school shops," but in the fact that schools are "school temples"!</p>
<p>If it is said that schools are school shops and principals are shopkeepers, then faculty and staff are partners, knowledge is goods, and who are the customers? Naturally, it is the students. In general business situations, employers always want to get a bargain and buy more, and there is absolutely no one who takes money and doesn't buy anything, nor is there anyone who is willing to take more money and buy less. If students are customers, they should want to pay less tuition and get more knowledge. They should not just pay tuition and not want knowledge, or pay more tuition and want less knowledge. Students must have the courage to buy vegetables in the vegetable market, weighing them and then pulling a handful. They must have the courage to buy cloth in the cloth shop, measuring it and then letting go of half a foot. If the goods are not suitable, they must be exchanged. If the goods are insufficient, they must be added. I think if students are really like customers, rushing to be the first, or fighting for more and measuring less, and not relaxing a little about knowledge and not being willing to suffer a loss at all, then the school is a "school shop," and "trading and retreating, each getting what they want," may not be a very reasonable method.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although schools are now school shops, students are not customers. Parents beg with thousands of words to pay tuition for them, but these young masters and misses are unwilling to study hard. Many people not only don't know the quality of the goods, but often regard inferior goods as treasures, and even don't want any goods at all. When the teacher forces them to take a little, they are very annoyed. Hearing that school is on vacation or the teacher is on leave, there is no class that does not cheer. They never think that vacations and leaves are a loss to the students. Not only that, but they also take leave on their own initiative, talk during class time, read novels, write love letters, play poker, and even strike. Just imagine that there are actually customers in the world who only pay money but are unwilling to take the goods. Isn't it a big joke—isn't it a big fool? Today, this kind of joke and this kind of fool can really be picked up everywhere and are everywhere. This is many times higher than the gentlemen in the Gentleman Country in Flowers in the Mirror.</p>
<p>People generally regard schools as school shops, but I think students regard schools as school temples. A temple is the most solemn and magnificent place in a temple. The principal is the abbot, the staff are ordinary monks, and the teachers are monks who can chant scriptures. Students are pilgrims. The pilgrims carry the book bags of "pilgrimage to the mountain and offering incense," put a handful of incense money into the money box of "returning all good to the same place," listen to the monks "chanting," some even want to get a good fortune stick that will bring good luck in everything, and some just play around in the Buddhist hall for a while, look at the clay statues of the Bodhisattvas, and smell the scent of incense candles, returning empty-handed without gaining anything. Paying tuition is considered almsgiving, registering is like joining the fate book, paying miscellaneous fees is like burning incense candles, listening to chanting is like attending classes, and a good, medium, or bad fortune stick is the report card. Apart from this, there is nothing else. When I was young, I played in small temples, and when I grew up, I played in big temples. If I had more money, I could also go to foreign churches to play. The only wish of burning incense is to hope that the Bodhisattva will bless me and that there will be great benefits in the future. The only wish of entering school is to hope that having a diploma will bring great benefits. Since I hope there will be benefits in the future, I must be generous in almsgiving now. Perhaps the more generous I am now, the greater the hope for the future. "If you want to take it, you must first give it." Why bother so much about immediate gains and losses? Naturally, I cannot learn the "penny-pinching" commercial behavior.</p>
<p>I am an old partner in a school shop for more than thirty years. Do you say that I should like to see customers who only take money and don't want goods, or should I be sad? Should I still stick to my post and force the goods to customers who are unwilling to take the goods? Or should I be smarter and learn from the monks who "chant," so that "everything is empty" and "all three thousand disciples are happy"?</p>
<h3>Random Talk on Using a Brush</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Chu Henan asked Yu Yongxing: "How does my calligraphy compare to Ouyang Xun?" Yongxing said: "Xun's use of the brush, whether good or bad, is handy, but you don't seem to be able to." Xian Ganbo wrote after the preface to the Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley: "It is very difficult to travel without a good brush. Although I reluctantly finished writing, I have changed the brush three times." (The general meaning is like this) It can be seen that the calligrapher's use of the brush is like a warrior's use of weapons, and those who are good at swords may not be good at guns. Wei Furen's Notes on the Brush Formation says: "The brush should be made of rabbit hair from the high mountains and steep peaks, harvested in August and September. The brush head should be one inch long, and the handle should be five inches long. It is best to have a sharp and strong point." Su Dongpo used Coptis chinensis soup to mix with blue powder to dip the brush, and dried it before putting it away. Huang Shangu used Sichuan pepper soup to grind pine smoke to dye the brush and store it. Zhao Songxue, when he encountered a brush that was smooth and satisfactory, would cut it open, take out its fine hairs, and store them separately. He would gather the essence of three brushes and have the workers bind them into one brush, so that both regular and cursive script, large and small, would be impossible. Liu Shi'an broke the new brush, selected the fine hairs himself, re-bundled them purely, and did not hand them over to the workers. The ancients were so careful about using brushes.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, there were chicken heart brushes, baby hair brushes, orangutan hair brushes, rat tail brushes, and wolf hair brushes. During the Qing Dynasty, there were even more sable hair brushes. In the late Ming Dynasty, Mr. Chen Baisha used reeds to make them, named Mao Long brushes. The ones made by Jie Yuanzhai in Guangzhou City today are very famous. I wrote with one by chance at Mr. Ma Gongyu's place, and I felt that it was quite smooth and satisfactory.</p>
<h3>About Lin Daqin</h3>
<p>— Xue Yun</p>
<p>Reading Zheng Guoyi's article in Free Talk on February 24, which records Lin Daqin's ignorance of historical sites, saying that Lin made a record of the reconstruction of Baoyun Rock and misused the affairs of Niu and Li, is not true, because what Mr. Zheng saw was not the original work. According to Lin Daqin, whose courtesy name is Jingfu, was from Haiyang, Chaozhou (now Chao'an). He was the number one scholar in the Ming Jiajing Xinmao examination, and the champion in the Ren Chen examination, and was awarded the title of editor, at the age of twenty, and was not yet married. When he was about to be appointed to an official position, he suddenly resigned and shared his ideas with Wang Longxi and Luo Nian'an. His noble character shone on Lingnan. There is a collection of the Eastern Pu Mr. set published. (Ruan Yuntai's Guangdong General History has a biography) There are now two records of the reconstruction of Baoyun Rock, both of which are said to be made in the Renyin year. The one using the affairs of Niu and Li has more than 600 characters. According to the Dongpu Collection, there is another record of the reconstruction of Baoyun Rock, which has only more than 400 characters and does not involve the affairs of Niu and Li. At the end, it says: "I will one day resign from office and return to my hometown, and I will be able to spend my days and nights there with my colleagues, forgetting my old age. This is also something that I will do to continue the work of my ancestors." This can be determined to be written before Mr. Lin retired. The one that Mr. Zheng saw was a forgery by later generations, and the publisher mistakenly included it, because there were no two at the same time. There is an essay on the party of Niu and Li in the Collection, listing historical events of the Han and Song dynasties to discuss Niu and Li, and saying: "In the end, the great power of the court fell into the hands of the eunuchs, and the disaster of usurpation and killing was written in the books." He seemed to have foreseen the eunuch disaster in the Ming Dynasty. How could such a person not know about the affairs of Niu and Li? Mr. Zheng grew up in Shanghai, so it is appropriate that he did not see the whole picture. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Illness</h3>
<p>— Nianhong</p>
<p>A relative contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. Although there is no specific medicine that can take effect immediately or be cured in three days, it is not necessarily impossible to save. As long as the treatment is appropriate, attention is paid to nutrition, environment, and mood, it is not difficult to regain health in a year or so. Although my relative's family is not rich, they can always get by. Unfortunately, he lacks scientific medical common sense and has no decisiveness, so he procrastinates and delays treatment, concealing his illness and avoiding doctors. The condition is getting worse every day. I have thought this more than once, and have also told him this euphemistically, but as soon as he hears someone mention his illness, he feels sad and unhappy, so I dare not say more. Moreover, the relationship between us is not very close. We rarely meet, and when we do, we just exchange a few polite greetings and that's it.</p>
<p>He himself understands that he has pulmonary disease, but although he often consults doctors, when the doctor tells him what to do, such as returning to his hometown, opening his ribs, getting injections, and artificial pneumothorax, he does not seem to believe that he really has pulmonary disease, and begins to doubt the X-ray image. The symptoms of pulmonary disease are numerous, sometimes coughing, sometimes headache, sometimes weakness in the waist and legs, sometimes fever and night sweats, and sometimes poor appetite. Although he does not follow the doctor's advice to rest for a long time, he troubles the doctor whenever he feels uncomfortable. When he coughs, he likes to take cough syrup, and when he has a headache, he swallows aspirin at will. But after taking cough syrup, the cough is better, but the head hurts again. After swallowing a few aspirin, the head seems to be no longer hurting, but the waist and legs feel sore and weak. This cycle continues. Every time I go to his house, the bedside is full of medicine bottles and jars, but the illness still does not improve. Not only does it not improve, but it becomes more serious.</p>
<p>I once had such an experience. The lid of one of my small old wooden boxes for storing books was broken, so I took a hammer and a few nails to repair it myself. It seemed easy, and it would be fine if I nailed it firmly, but when one corner was nailed firmly, the other corner popped up. When I nailed the other corner firmly, the first corner bounced up again. This went on and on, and I was exhausted. It turned out that the lid had been soaked in water, so the wood was uneven. In the end, I asked a carpenter to replace it with a new one.</p>
<p>Some people say how corrupt the current education system is, some say how despicable the current officialdom is, some say how dangerous the current economic situation is, and some say how bad the current people's hearts are... and some people put forward specific proposals on how to reform education, basic methods on how to clarify officialdom, perfect suggestions on how to rectify the economy, and majestic papers on how to restore social customs; but these are just symptoms like coughing, headache, weakness in the waist and legs, fever and night sweats, and poor appetite; and what is used are just proprietary medicines like cough syrup and aspirin. If one is cured, the other cannot be cured; and if this one is cured, the other cannot be cured. In fact, even the root cannot be eradicated, but only slightly alleviates some of the disease.</p>
<p>I recently heard that my relative is in bed with a "cold," headache, and fever. It seems that the "cold" will get better in a week or half a month, but his health will never recover, because he cannot start from the root and from the bottom. If he is willing to start from the bottom, although the pulmonary disease has reached the second stage, there is still hope for recovery, and it has not reached the point of "incurable" or "incurable." There are methods, and they are very common and ordinary, and the patient himself may also know them, so what is terrible is not the "disease," but the "concealment" of the disease. What is lacking is not the "medicine," but the "heart" to take the medicine. Even the best doctors cannot help but be helpless.</p>
<h3>Celebration</h3>
<p>— Why Bother</p>
<p>Last time, a friend sent a packet of red eggs and arranged to attend the one-month celebration feast yesterday. To celebrate the friend's newborn and to satisfy my appetite, I went to gorge myself as usual. This reminded me that throughout history, regardless of location, the event of "birth" is taken very seriously. From the moment a person cries into the world, a one-month celebration is held, followed by birthdays at one year old, ten years old, twenty years old, twenty-nine years old, thirty years old... (and so on). Celebrations must be held. Some people even celebrate their birthdays every year, and even small birthdays are celebrated lavishly. Some people constantly send out red envelopes with the message "Your Humble Servant's Thirtieth Grand Celebration," taking advantage of their large following to receive a flood of gifts, which borders on business. Although some people criticize the latter as begging for money, on the other hand, it demonstrates that this person values their "birth." Time flies, how long is a person's life? Since the lost life cannot be brought back, why not celebrate? Moreover, it requires arranging a feast, so it cannot be purely considered begging for money. If it is said to be seeking a small profit, like a business, is it also following the way of loyalty and forgiveness?</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that someone advocated: "Do not celebrate below sixty years old," which is admirable. Life is only a hundred years. If one sends out invitations every year below sixty, one would only do so sixty times in a lifetime. Using a limited number of years to seek a small number of celebrations is truly sad. Moreover, among the 450 million people in China, how many have the means to celebrate below sixty years old? As for those who have the means to celebrate, even with someone's loud call, I dare to guarantee that they will still ignore it and have a lively celebration behind closed doors. Therefore, someone's appeal has the spirit of "knowing it cannot be done but doing it anyway." My admiration is endless, and I believe it will be approved by readers!</p>
<p>Buddhism considers birth, old age, sickness, and death as the four great sufferings of sentient beings, with "birth" being the first because old age, sickness, and death come after "birth." The saying "no birth, no extinction" means that. In today's terms, it means "you only live once," and humanity should respect its "birth." The secular custom of celebrating birthdays should have the meaning of cherishing it. Even failing to cherish it is the footnote to what I mentioned above, "truly sad." Listen to today's radio stations playing "Happy Birthday" songs or "Happy Birthday to You." Although people are tired of hearing it, or hang up the phone, or shout loudly into the phone, some people still request it, and some people still enjoy listening to it. It is nothing more than everyone valuing their lives and having a longing and attachment to their own birthdays.</p>
<p>Today's celebrities mostly have a desire to protect their reputation. When celebrating grandly, they must donate money to help education and relieve refugees. Since the country cannot save the poor, benefiting the lonely and needy through celebrities' celebrations is truly killing several birds with one stone. As for ordinary people's birthdays, eating a few longevity noodles is enough. Originally, they had to eat, but it's just a substitute, presumably related to frugality and has nothing to do with prohibitions. Therefore, if I were the someone mentioned above, I would say: Celebrations are allowed below sixty!</p>
<h3>Strange Pledges</h3>
<p>— No Fault</p>
<p>We always thought that the nature of banking business is relatively... but strange things still happen. According to the American Bank, the bank recently received three batches of applications for pledges one after another, and the collateral was: (1) a cart of dried flies; (2) a boat of horse tails; (3) a batch of used dentures. According to the applicant, the flies are for feeding birds, and the hair on the horse tails is used for the sights of guns and cannons. They can be used as the intersecting fine lines on the sight. But, what are the used dentures for? No one can figure it out!</p>
<p>As a result, none of the three pledges were successful. The bank's response was "the collateral is not widely marketable," therefore, they could not agree.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Suspicion Reappears (86)</p>
<p>Little Wang's mother said, "The boss has already angered Mr. Xu away, what are you still crying for!" Qiwan cried for a while before raising her head and asking, "Mr. Xu left, did he say anything?" Little Wang's mother said, "He didn't say anything, I asked him to come tomorrow, but he didn't agree." Qiwan was clever and cried again on the bed. Little Wang's mother said, "Boss! If you have any grievances in your heart, why not tell Mr. Xu directly and frankly, so as to avoid misunderstandings between you two? Things will be clear once you talk about them." Qiwan shook her head and said, "You don't know, how can I tell Mr. Xu! Let him be angry, I want him to be angry!" Little Wang's mother said, "Boss, aren't you and Mr. Xu very close? Why are you so at odds? I think..." Little Wang's mother was just saying this when they heard a burst of doorbell ringing outside, the sound was very urgent. Qiwan said, "Wang Ma, don't say anymore, go out and see who it is." Little Wang's mother hurried downstairs and ran back upstairs, reporting, "Director Miao is here." Qiwan was anxious and said, "I'm so disheveled, like a ghost, how can I see him! Wang Ma, you hurry out and ask him to sit in the living room first, I'll be there soon." Qiwan sent Little Wang's mother out, hurriedly got out of bed, locked the door first, walked to the dressing table, hurriedly wiped her face, just combed her hair, and was about to reapply makeup when she heard the door being knocked loudly, very urgently, thinking it must be Zhongjie knocking outside, hurriedly patted her face twice with a powder puff, pulled her pajamas, looked in the mirror, and then went over to open the door. Zhongjie squeezed in at once, first looking around, as if looking for someone, then staring at Qiwan, and said with a cold smile, "Sleeping with the door closed in broad daylight, are you afraid of a robber coming in?" Qiwan saw that he was talking impolitely, with an unwilling expression on his face. If it were normal times, with her stubborn temper, she would have chased him out with a few words. Because she needs to use him now, she cannot but try to please him, first patted him on the broad shoulder, and said charmingly with a smile, "That's right, I'm afraid of robbers, afraid of you, the robber, breaking in!" Zhongjie frowned and said, "I'm not kidding with you, I have something to ask you!" Saying that, he pushed Qiwan away.</p>

<h3>Caring for Helpless and Impoverished Compatriots - Hoping for Donations from Enthusiastic Philanthropists for Relief</h3>
<p>The twentieth application for the Qingxin Relief Fund, sponsored by this newspaper, will be reviewed on the 6th of this month. There is still a surplus of funds available. Impoverished compatriots who are lonely, unable to make a living, poor and sick, and unable to afford medical treatment can provide detailed information about their background and family circumstances, certified by the head of the field or baozhang, and find a guarantor, then register and send it to this department for review. Those who are found to be true after investigation will be given a living allowance. Due to currency values, this relief fund has been experiencing a shortage of funds in recent months. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously so that this good deed will not be interrupted, and helpless and impoverished compatriots will receive unexpected relief, which is a truly good thing.</p>
