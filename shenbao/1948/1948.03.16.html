<h3>美衆院外委會草擬通盤法案　包括經濟及軍事援華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十五日廣播：華盛頓訊，衆院外委會開始起草通盤之對外援助法案，其藍本係出諸共和黨領袖之手。彼等希望法案能於四月十日在衆院中通過，如此則有充份時間與參院獲致妥協辦法，而於四月十八日義國選舉之前，將該法案置於杜魯門總統之辦公桌上。該法案中除包括參院所通過之歐洲復興計劃外，並將包括對華之經濟援助，以及對希土之軍事援助，而對華之軍事援助亦將有所規定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社梅恩州奧古斯泰十五日電〕共和黨參議員塔虎脫，十五日在此間作總統競選演說，謂共產主義在中國蔓延與在西歐同樣危險。共產主義且爲朝鮮及日本所受一威脅。國務卿馬歇爾一方面承認華北及東北有被共軍佔領之危險，一方面反對軍事援助南京政府，殊屬矛盾。華北及東北如被共軍佔領，則美國在朝鮮之處境將不安，不久，日本或將被迫淪入共產主義。是則太平洋之濱將見共產勢力滿布，其危險或甚於東歐局勢。</p>
<h3>調整所得稅征額及稅率　立院財會略加縮減　完成程序後即可公布施行</h3>

<h3>國際文化合作的新頁</h3>
<p>—從聯教組織資助我國考察說到掃除文化合作的阻力—</p>
<p>最近聯合國敎育科學文化組織，決定以上年節餘經費，贈送我國選派專家六人考察進修；中國委員會已推定人選，啓行當不在遠。這是國際文化交流工作中一件有意義的新事，也可爲我國文化敎育所以進而貢獻世界和平啓示一種新的希望。</p>
<p>聯敎組織自從一九四五年十一月在英國成立以來，只有二年餘的時間，已在巴黎與墨西哥舉行二次大會，文化憲章制訂的周密，加入國家的衆多，與舉辦事業的廣遠，可說已比第一次大戰後「國際智識合作委員會」，爲更著成績。他曾首先發動遠東各國舉行基本敎育會議，更以中國文教受戰禍最慘，每予以深切的注視和扶助。這一份熱情和善意，眞是我們愛好和平的中國人所應該感謝而珍惜的。</p>
<p>此次進修考察所指定的六種門類，是科學與社會發展，影音敎育，兒童敎育，圖書館學，敎育行政與藝術音樂。記得聯敎組織的成立時所定的任務之一，即爲「藉各種敎育組織或方法（如圖書館，無綫電，交換師生等）以促進世界人類思想之自由交流」，前項各門類，正是謀從這幾種途徑來協助中國來善盡此一任務。所以考察硏討的範圍雖各殊，而他們都應具有促進思想交流和文化合作以貢獻世界和平的共同目標。這樣目標的考察進修，加以我們推荐手續的愼重，顯然和過去一般出國考察或硏究有異。他的旨趣更爲嚴肅，使命也更見重大。</p>
<p>從民族與人類文化的遠景着想，我們對於今後國際文化合作潮流，願寄以深厚的希望，而對於受此國際機構資助考察進修的諸君，自不能不期待其有卓越的成績。我們所望於諸君者，一則必須有自尊心和自信力。中國目前雖然科學落後，敎育事業不發達，但我們決不可以當前的現實，而自餒或妄自菲薄。我們要求敎於人者，當然很多；但聯敎的理想是互助合作，所以我們決不嬝片面的接受，而要兼重與彼邦人士對於一般觀念與方法，充分交換意見。中國在世界文化中有卓越的地位，對此次世界戰爭有巨大的貢獻和犧牲，所以在聯敎的使命中，我們自信中國應有而且必能有重大的貢獻。其次是必須有準備，有耐心。在行前須充份考量應注意的具體問題，而在考察的有限時間中，更當細心訪求，充分利用，務求回國後，能對上述各殊的事業，發生良好的影響。</p>
<p>因爲歐美一般智識份子對中國之隔膜，「因而形成許多錯誤的認識與離奇的輿論，所以，今後中國與國際文化合作之一個先決條件，是要聯合國人士更多明瞭中國文化傳統的短長得失，和今日一般的情勢，這正有待於我們的敎育家和專門學者在國外多所宣說，而此次考察諸君又是義無旁貸的。中國當前紛亂的癥結，是在於建設力量之遭遇破壞力量，安定力之頻受動亂，和善良人民之横被威脅與凌暴。中國的文化演進，正受到最嚴重的新番達主義的襲擊。這種暴力一日不掃除，中國即一日不能有多量貢獻於文化合作的大業。</p>
<p>不但如此，今後世界文化合作的大前提，在於保障國際的和平，而國際和平必須先有各國國內之和平與進步。然而今日的世界，雖是會盟相望，表面上維持和好；而國際間對峙形成，猜忌日深。東西若千經濟文化落後的國家，更因共產黨不斷的搗亂，其國內已是充滿火藥氣息和不安寗的情緒，而敎育文化正在遭受嚴重的破壞。聯教所懸的目標所努力的工作正是共產黨所要破壞的。一方面是謀求各國科學與社會的發展，他方面則到處破壞社會的安定與繁榮；一方面在熱心籌戰後兒竄的敎養，他方面正在不斷　造　　與　依　兒　和　　。　教組織要致刀於各國　　　　　　　　　　，　　　　　　　　　書文物，窒息知識，與　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　旨趣，在於以科學文敎合作來　　進人類互助與世界和平；　另一國際性的暴力則正在　孔不入的毁損文敎，破壤和平，以役使人類，走向文化的末運。</p>
<p>中國是文明的古國，更是今日世界和平重要的一　。同今日的中國，正處於民生備受　脅文化　遭摧殘的　運。有共匪暴力之横行破壞，即不能見中國之敎　進　與文化復興；有共匪之存在，就不能使中國爲國際文敎合作善盡其使命。</p>
<p>中國文化演進的最太敵人，也即是世界文化合作的基本阻力。歐洲中世末葉　達人的破壞被咀咒爲文明之敵；不意文化演進到了今日，竟有這新番達主義新侵略主義披猖，為聯合國神聖的文化活動當前之敵。參與聯教組織的各國人士，對此當由痛澈的覺察，而發爲有效的國際正論的制裁，必如此乃能保障人類免於恐懼與匱乏的自由，必如此乃能復盡我們由文化教育科學導成和平的使命。</p>
<h3>關於本年度的農貸</h3>
<p>每當大宗農產物上市之際，各遝銷商人，以資金有限，不敷運用；且以時間關係，不容曠日持久；故於事前，不得不向往來各行莊洽好頭寸，以便匯撥。其爲數較鉅，又非一二家行莊之資力所能承受者，則往往組織銀幽，共同辦理。有如棉花，小麥，蠶繭，茶葉等，即是。</p>
<p>戰後各類農產，以種種原因，其生產類雖已大减，但以商人虛盈實虧其本身之實力，亦大非昔比；各行莊又以存款激减，並無鉅款游資可資運用；而一方面則以物價奇昂，底碼太高，所需要的支支籌碼却大量地增加。因此，從前各行莊所可分負之融通責任，在今日，巳不得不轉移到國家行局，爲惟一可靠　後援。</p>
<p>國家行局　貸款，是以國家的經濟政策爲轉移的。應否承貸，條件如何，以及所貸　對象如何，在行局本身，並沒有最後　決定權。同時，爲　　款項，周轉頭寸起見，且須向中央銀行作轉　　或再　　　請求。因此，這一類收購農產的資金，在實際上，　　　府　貸款，而商人向行局請求融通，亦無異向政府求援。　在　一類貸款，在事前，往往須向中央先行申請，經核准後，批交某某行局照辦，方可辦理一切手續，這便是一個實例。</p>
<p>但國家的貸款方針，亦並非一成不變的。有時較爲寬鬆，有時十分嚴緊，有時且直截了當，予以拒絕。縱在照當開放的時候，其重心與方式，亦時有變動。商人配合不上，便很容易失去了可以利用的時效。故在手續方面，尤應力求簡化，迅速辦理。</p>
<p>以言卅七年度農業及土地金融貸款計劃，總計十五萬億元，已於本月十一日，約四聯正式通過了。除其他各種農貸外，計茶葉貸款爲八百億元，蠶桑貸款爲一千五百億元。旣經規定數目準備發放，諒來本年的茶貸與繭貸等，當不至坐誤時機，無從照辦，或臨事慌促，艱於應付了。不過計劃是一事，而實施又是一事。例如將來涎放之時，究竟採用何種方式？利率如何核定？其資金來源，是否悉由行局庫自行調度？就茶繭論，大部分固屬出口，而一部分還是內銷，這項貸款，能否一律納人貸款對象，即出口貿易事業項下？凡此種種，有待於補充釐訂，或互相商洽的節目尙多。爲免蹈辦理太遲的　轍，與照原案所定「務其貸款均能按照預定計劃，獲得最大的效果」起見，我們以爲，有關方面，均應把握時機，迅速準備，以期獲得圓滿的解決。大家知道：所謂農業貸款，應不單是便利商人問題，而實是幫助農民問題，亦不單是幫助農民問題，而即是維護生產，與增加出口問題。如果眞要解決當前經濟問題的話，那麽，對於農貸上所有一切技術，自不應過於輕視。</p>

<h3>英外相貝文正式宣布西德參加歐洲復興　十六國會議昨在巴黎揭幕　西班牙獲數國支持亦有參加之可能</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：巴黎訊，歐洲十六國會議於本日標準時間十四點零四分在法國外交部之一鐘廳」開幕，除瑞士與冰島外，各國外長均親自出席。英外相貝文宣布，英法將聯合建議將德境英美法佔區包括在歐洲復興計劃之內，認爲此乃保證戰敗國家參與歐洲復興之唯一辦法。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕十六國歐洲復興會議，業於今日下午在法國外交部之鐘廳內揭幕，由法外長皮杜爾任主席。首先到會塲者爲英外相貝文，繼之者爲義外長史福薩·皮杜爾發表歡迎辭後，即由各國首席代表相繼發言。貝文之重要演說將於下午四時（上海時間午夜）發表。然後十六國專家將在凱旋門附近豪華的皇家蒙梭旅舍內開會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十五日電〕此間預料英外相貝文將發表一歷史性之宣言，指出新英國之大陸政策。預料英國並將在歷史上，第一次表示其願意與二億七千萬西歐人民聯盟，阻止共產主義之成脅。此十六個歐洲國家聯盟可能成長爲歐洲合衆國，北起北極南迄菲陸，惟此一結果有待新英國外交政策及美國普遍援助之表示。此後，英法兩國並將聯合發表驚人行動，脫離彼等原來政策，建議給予德國在援歐計劃工作委會中之發言權。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕英外相貝文今晨自倫敦乘火車抵達巴黎，英使館人員及法國官員均在車站數迎，貝文下車後逕赴英大使館休息，旋即赴法外部訪問皮杜爾，討論西德參加本屆會議之細則問題。西德參加會議之原則，已於昨夜經巴黎倫敦華盛頓在電話中會商決定。貝文定於明日下午離巴黎赴比京，於星期三簽訂五國西歐聯盟公約。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕葡萄牙政府十五日通知英外交部稱，葡決意向十六國會議建議，要求將西班牙包括於參加馬歇爾計劃之國家內。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕此間人士對於本屆會議之收穫，已在作種種揣測。美參院批准歐洲復典方案之消息，已擊破自捷克政變以來歐洲的政治煞暗空氣。巴黎人士最感興趣者爲西班牙及德國參加馬歇爾方案之希望。義外長史福薩在赴巴黎之快車中語記者，「吾人必須認識目前已爲組織歐洲之時期。本人此次來巴黎，具有充份信心，因爲最近之發展，已使我等國家不得不成立協議故也」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社弗朗克福十五日電〕英國官員今日宣稱，德國代表將以經濟專家資格，會同英美軍政府代表參加巴黎會議，共同討論馬歇爾計劃。戰後德代表參加國際會議，以此爲創舉，德代表將於日內啓程至巴黎。</p>
<h3>西歐外長集巴黎　大會議程分為四大項目</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕出席馬歇爾方案會議之西歐諸國代表均將發表重大的政策演說，大部份與會國均將由外長親自出席。業已抵達巴黎者，有英外相貝文·比總理兼外長史巴克·荷外長奧斯特霍·盧森堡外長貝克·瑞典外長恩登·挪外長朗琪。丹外長賴斯慕森。義外長史福薩。希副總理兼外長蔡爾達理斯。大會最初兩日將舉行全體大會三次，分別於十五日下午，十六日上午及下午舉行，可使十六國巨頭共有約八小時之時問（翻譯時間除外）以發表其政策演說。</p>
<p>大會議程別爲四大類：（一）接受十六國於去夏舉行經濟合作會議以來關於自助計劃之決議行動及成就的報吿。（二）接受（或許並不討論）美政府特委會之調査報吿，此等報吿各爲「國家」及「物品」報吿。（三）設立工作委會，以起草十六國永久性機構之章程，及起草規定相互間繼續經濟合作之多邊協定。　討論德國參加經濟合作委會未來會議之方式及範幽。</p>
<p>大會之主要工作，可槪述如下：在政治方面，將表現歐洲蘇聯勢力圈以外之各國業已決定團結工作，以經由有計劃的經濟復興，獲致政治安定。在經濟方面，目前已爲在美國國會就歐洲復興方案成立決議前之最後機會，以擬其歐洲在自助方面的計劃與成就　之平衡表，並成立必要的工作機構，俾以最高度效能處理美援。</p>
<p>大會全體會議可望於本週內完成，最初兩日之全體大會，將由各國首席代表發表政策演說，此後兩三天之全體大會，將由各代表團之高級代表從事討論，然後始由專家會組之工作委會，開始細則任務以設立永久性機構。工作委會之任務約須三五四星期始能完成，希望能於美國會前後通過歐洲復興方案之時完成，俾於歐洲復興方案成爲法律後，即得召開第三屆十六國經濟合作委會之全體大會。</p>
<h3>國際商會已草就歐復興行動計劃</h3>
<p>準備向巴黎會議提出</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕十國工商領袖及專家共同起草之歐洲復興行動計劃，將於今日由國際商會會長基奈斯向十六國馬歇爾方案會議提出，該計劃認爲任何國家在道義上有權要求援助以前，應先充分而有效利用其現有的資源及配備。暫時推翻縮短二時的趨勢，及廢止勞役資兩方限制的辦法，可以减少需要的援助數額及協助歐洲自立。該計劃並認歐洲政府之最主要責任，在以平衡收支及不使國家資源過分榨取，以制止戰後通貨膨脹，國營企業至少應收支相抵，公務人員應設法减少，使服務於生產事業。援助所得收入，切不可用於不必要的開支，應用以撲滅通貨膨脹的趨勢，以完成「無眼淚的通貨緊縮」。參加國際商會之計劃者，有英美澳比加法義荷瑞士等國之專家。</p>
<h3>塔虎脫意見認為局勢不嚴重</h3>
<p>不以貝爾納斯所言爲然</p>
<p>〔路透社麻州　克登十四日電〕共和黨參議員塔虎脫今日聲稱，渠對前國務卿貝爾納斯昨日所稱，美國在四至五星期內，將面臨對蘇危機之語，不敢同意。渠覺迄至日前為止蘇聯祇不過在雅爾達協定所確認的蘇聯勢力圈內鞏固其地位而已，就捷克而言，在共黨發動政變以前，該國已受蘇聯控制，此次事件不過爲一種鞏固地位的手段而已。他又說，目前全世界之局勢，尙爲勢力戰爭而非軍事戰爭，共黨如果在義大利之普選中獲勝，又不是軍事行動，美國當然不能拿他怎樣，而馬歇爾方案至少須在六個月以後始能產生效能。最後他又說，美國如果以爲共黨在捷克與義大利的行動即爲戰爭，實不免庸人自擾耳。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾向參院外會陳辭要求予希土援助　義加赤化勢將喪失美援</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十五日廣播：華盛頓訊，馬歇爾國務卿爲支持對希土二億七千五百萬美元之新軍事援助起見，本日出席參院外交委員會發表意見稱，我國必須避免恐懼心理，致使行動陷於停頓，亦不能匆促行事，以致浪費資源。渠謂，由於共產黨之恐怖與欺詐手段，歐洲局勢巳較一年前嚴重。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十五日廣播：華盛頓訊，國務院本日直率表示。苟義國共產黨在四月十八日之選舉中獲勝，則義國不能再獲美國之援助。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕馬歇爾或將於本星期內告美國議會須有歐洲復興計劃以外之步驟，以防止蘇聯之擴張。在馬歇爾應付渠所謂「非當非常嚴重」之世界危機計劃中，可能列入提高軍力。馬歇爾在本星期內將與議會舉行若干次秘密會議，十五日與參院外交委員會之會議乃爲其第一次，議會方面現逐漸加强壓力要求馬歇爾坦白說明目前世界局勢。</p>
<p>參院撥款委員會主席勃里奇要求政府說明目前戰爭威脅究竟已至如何嚴重之階段。渠稱：「我人欲詐細知道對此我人將如何應付」。僉信政府應付世界危機之計劃尙未擬定。而仍在討論階段，當此計劃擬定時，杜魯門或將發表一嚴厲之聲明。是項發展可無異吿知蘇聯繼續向西方擴張將被認爲對世界和平與美國安全之威脅。馬歇爾今日在撥款委員會將要求支持渠二億七千五百萬元軍事援助希土之建議。十六日馬歇爾列席參院軍事委員會時，主席蓋尼將詢問馬歇爾之需要及其理由。許多議員均認爲僅持歐洲復興計劃不足阻止歐洲之共產主義，數月來馬歇爾一向認定復興計劃爲阻止共產主義之最佳方法，最後或將同意各議員之意見也。問題在乎如何防止共黨之間接滲入。杜魯門總統呼籲美國應認淸是項對自由人民之「間接行動」乃對世界與美國之威脅。目前最値得重視者爲義大利之局勢。</p>
<h3>匈獨立紀念</h3>
<p>蘇捷等國派代表參加</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社布達佩斯十四日電〕匈牙利獨立百年紀念，明日將舉行隆重典禮。蘇捷南波保羅六國政府之代表團與法義奧三國之私人代表團，今日均由總統延見。</p>
<h3>西歐聯防公約可能擴大範圍　並將請美保證軍事援助</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社安加拉十四日電〕希臘外長蔡爾達里斯發表宣言稱彼將在巴黎硏究締結英法荷比盧希土七國公約之可能性，土耳其政界聞此消息，大爲興奮，因此約爲土耳其久所盼望成立者，今信此一公約如得美國之贊助，可在巴黎十六國會議之外加以討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕負責外交官員今日宣稱：英法比荷盧五國盟約，本星期三簽字，第二步將設法取得美國確實保障於必要時出兵相助。五國代表在比京會議時，原已一致認爲美國外交政策，無論何黨執政，現須積極與聞歐洲局勢，此後須取得者則爲正式保證，於一旦有事之時，迅即全力參戰。此種保證如能明白加以宣布，即足使任何侵略國知難而退。美國如果出於此舉，則其現行外交政策必須大加擴充。</p>
<h3>美行政當局擬要求國會對蘇採軍事措施　海陸空三部國防會議已休會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕美行政部方面，擬向國會要求採取軍事準備措施，以爲美國對蘇發表强硬聲明之後援。該項聲明之大意，即係如蘇聯再進一步對歐洲侵略，將屬危險之舉。據高級人士方面訊：此項動議，現正在美內閣及參衆二院人士之積極考慮慮中。此項動議之目的，係旨在予蘇聯明白之警吿，表明美國認未來共黨之擴張，特別係共黨在義奪取政權，係對美國安全威脅之舉。惟消息靈通人士力稱：由於此項動議含有範圍廣汎之複雜意義，現正在討論中，當未有何決定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕陸軍方面十四日夜宣佈，國防部長福萊斯特與其海陸空軍首長在佛羅里達州基威斯特所召開之會議，業已休會。福萊斯特召集週末之「郊外會議」，目的係在解決三部間有關國防計劃所採取之軍略方案之廣汎爭端。渠又並稱：此項會議並將決定，根據武裝力量合併案，何人以何種武器，担任何種任務，現在佛羅里達州之福萊斯特將視察該州之若干軍事基地。關於此次會議，在福萊斯特返此間後，或將竣表一項報吿。</p>
<h3>蘇芬談判公約　廿二日開始</h3>
<p>史達林通知芬政府</p>

<h3>美總理痛斥共黨　羅馬三萬婦女作反戰大遊行　普選在即全國局勢緊張</h3>
<p>〔聯介社羅馬十四日電〕加斯貝利總理今日發表競選演說，痛斥共產黨。據稱，共黨正謀在義大利不法行動，義共黨長此爲國際運動之一部份，即不能與之合作。國人一度因義大利人之獨裁而喪失自由，謹防將來勿再喪失。下次非爲義大利人之獨裁而爲來自另一國家之獨裁。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十四日電〕義大利三萬婦女今在羅馬市街舉行反戰遊行，高呼「打倒原子彈」等口號。彼等係來自全國各地，乃「和平法庭」（義和平運動之名稱）所屬全國各婦女團體之代表。在遊行之前，曾舉行大會，由若干代表包括鐳錠發明者居禮夫婦之女名科學家愛琳居禮等，發表反戰演說，要求全球普遍裁軍及銷燬原子彈等。旋由代表團謁見尼杜拉總統，呈遞二百萬婦女簽名之「和平宣言」，遊行行列至義大利無名英雄墓前始解散。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十四日電〕據義大利五大城十四日調査之結果，業已證明，義大利之富有家族，在四月十八日義普選中如共黨獲勝，即準備迅速逃亡出國。此項在杜靈·米蘭·熱諾亞·米馬·及那不勒所舉行之調査，業已證明申請護照，在米蘭較之平時高十三倍，在羅馬高十倍，而其他城市則較此二城倍數稍低。工業生產及商業活動之要求新投資者，現已完全停止。此次義大利普選，一言以蔽之，係共黨與非共黨間爲控制國會及政府之總決鬥。世界輿論亦集中於此項選舉上，可能決定何人控制地中海，馬歇爾計劃之成功與否，以及在羅馬城中世界天主敎中樞之命運。目前一項之意見，認爲共黨陣綫將獲得百分之卅五至四十，甚至可能有百分之四十五至五十之票數。共黨領袖杜格里亞蒂在杜靈二度發表演說，攻擊馬歇爾計劃企圖將義國作爲反蘇原于戰之根據地，要求左翼在四月選舉中獲得勝利，以「挽救和平」。</p>

<h3>徐州看戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十二日訊〕新春到徐州，恰在軍事上一個比較緊張的階段，蘇北的匪軍各路有蠢動，碭山黄口和東海一帶，國軍亦在積極行動，就在這個時候最高當局又於九日親自來徐，檢閱特種部隊，並主持重要會議，前後駐節三日之久。種種客觀情勢，使人心亦略呈緊張。不過這裏的居民，大多數是習慣在戰時氣氛中生活，有些已經有過圍城生活的經驗，自然的比較堅定鎭靜。徐州的大街馬路上，軍人到處都是，重要的建築什九是軍事機關在用，馬路上疾馳而過的，不是舒適的小轎車，而是笨重的軍用車。特別在大路的交叉點上，都建築有强固的鋼骨水泥堡壘，必要時立刻可以變成據點。指揮交通的，不是交通警員而是士兵。在徐州的中正路上，有電訊局等幾所大建築，是日本人在敵偽時期造成的，工程極堅固，當時日人會預備在萬不得已時，作爲進行巷戰的最後支點。去年冬季，匪軍一度進迫徐市，北面九里山的大砲已開始發射，這裏國軍當局亦作了萬一的準備，幾所大建築物的週圍，都佈置有電網和交通壕。現在，徐州的成脅早吿解除，但是警備的陳跡仍然保留。所以，雖然軍事行動是遠在徐州二百里外進行，而徐市依然是一片戰時景色。</p>
<p>匪軍行動飄忽</p>
<p>記者等抵徐的次日（十一日）適値主席駐節，陸總部忙得不可開交，到昨日午後三時主席返京後，總部方恢復正常活動。今天我們一行訪謁陸總部郭參謀長汝瑰，他過去在國防部內服務，工作於總部不過一載，但對於敵情的了解及戡亂軍事的見地，却異常深刻。他認爲匪軍的長處是行動飄忽，不可捉摸。關外的情形複雜，軍事之外有其他因素滲入，他不願談。關內的戡亂軍事，他認爲最重要的是不　讓共軍建立根據地。已經建立的亦必須予以驅出，然後將其壓迫至絕地，最後加以消滅。</p>
<p>追擊辦法有效</p>
<p>這裏面自然是包括一個長期的，不斷的，逍擊過程。這種辦法已證明其有效。例如去年山東戰事中，陳毅部下的第十縱滕，就在不斷追擊之下，最後被壓迫到黄河三角地帶的絕地，一次就消滅了他們四千人以上，這也是眞正的唯一的一次　殲。田於不斷的窮追，匪軍勢必拋棄不少配備，以後無法獲得補充，同時其部隊的幹部，在極度辛苦之下，就可能發生反正和投降的事情。去年魯中大戰，陳毅的第一，第四縱隊殘部，在上述苦况之下，投誠者就很多，一部份匪軍士兵大概是被脅從的無知良民，在大軍窮追之餘，竟躲到津浦路的軍車裏面去，直到車子開到江蘇境內，方才査明，竟俘虜了一百多人！郭氏認爲到這一天，匪軍幹部在大軍追擊之下，精神不能支持之日，也是戡亂收全功之時。馬歇爾國務卿在軍調小糾時，會表示「共軍有幾十萬願爲主義而犧牲的幹部，故不可輕視」，現在則犧牲已多，有力幹部已深感缺乏了。</p>
<p>清末巢捻實例</p>
<p>為了易於瞭解，郭氏曾以清委咸同時期的軍事作比較。他認爲匪軍今日的洗竄戰略，與當年的太平軍及捻匪頗有相類似之處。洗寇最怕的是天然障碍，特別是大的河洗。太平天國的翼王石達開，素具幹才，但是在西征的路綫上，始終受長江的限制，最後失敗於大渡河。他第一次過貴州時就地征兵，達二十萬人，出雲南時，竟聚衆至五十萬人。這情形很像共軍今天的「參軍」辦法。但這些都是裏脅良民，一到絕地，即吿瓦解，人多是沒有用的。曾國藩在剿捻過程，亦以河洗爲縮小捻匪活動的工具，這些歷史敎訓，在今日戡亂軍事上還有參考價値。至於匪軍的作戰力，他並不估計太高。他說：「統計年來各地國軍　吃虧，百分之八十是將官疏忽，對於行軍所經的地形不細加研究，因此，中了匪方的伏兵計。最近宜川之小挫，亦是這種情形。關內共軍的配備和實力，還沒有資格攻堅，從過去山東的記錄來看攻堅的時候就是他們大吃敗仗的時候。</p>
<p>利用民夫情形</p>
<p>有一點值得注意的，目前匪軍是就地補給，就地擴充，在這種辦法之下，使他們的將領易於發展天才。例如陳毅過去在匪軍將領中資望不高，可是在三人小組中，商討匪軍兩個集團軍司令人選，他們一個是提名彭德懷，那是當然的，另外不推林彪或他人，却提名陳毅，頗出人意外。而他們提名的根據，就從補充和擴充兵力上着眼的。」</p>
<p>「匪軍現在沒有根據地，亦沒有補給機構，不但食用一切取之於民，即搬運担架，亦完全利用民夫。他們因爲控制嚴密，人民無法逃避力役。我個人的估計，匪軍中的民夫，至少在國軍八倍乃至十倍以上，人民實在是不勝其苦。最近，山東匪軍亦竟提出「節省人力」的口號，反面亦可證明匪軍擾民的程度。因爲他們一切依賴就地補給，所以安置的民間幹部特多，以加强控制力量。國軍進入匪區，動輒中伏，這亦是主因。</p>
<p>如何應付鄉幹</p>
<p>要對付這批「鄉幹」，最有效的辦，否則「鄉幹」存在一日，匪軍即一日不能肅淸。例如：單縣·　城　碭山的三角地區與河南的舊考城一帶，一般稱之爲匪區，其實老百姓何曾是匪，只不渦共黨的幹部控制得嚴密而已。在這兩個地區之中，到處築有地道，相互溝通，所以屢次能躱避國軍的攻勢。將來這些地區之肅淸，固仍有仗於國軍之不斷追擊，但是建立地方武力，方是治本之道。地方武力的正確用途，應該不是作正面的攻守，而是撲滅匪軍留置的民間幹部。」</p>
<p>渡江的可能性</p>
<p>來自京滬區的人們，對於共匪「五月渡長江」的口號，很表關切。記者曾把這事的可能性，請郭參謀長作一判斷。他的看法很正確，値得特別介紹。他說：「此事可能。將來一定是幹部和小股匪軍，絡續渡江，慢慢的建立力量。他們現在的策略，是使「你的幹部也是我的幹部」，那就是造成一些「兩面的保甲長」，以威脅利誘爲手段，使南岸的良民成爲他們的工具。在力量未建立之前，他們不會有轟轟烈烈的大兵團渡江，但是在土共有相當聲勢時，他們就會選擇一個不注意的地點偸渡了。目前大別山區雖被國軍控制，但土共始終未被肅淸，實在値得嚴密注意。」如何發動民力，肅淸「鄉幹」，不是純軍事問題，而是與政治經濟配合改革的問題。記者抵徐數日，與各方接觸，深感此間軍政人員對於「知彼知己一一點，已有一種新的認識，這是兩年來環境鍛鍊出來的，本此認識，輔以力行，相信必能使戰局一新。（本報記者丁維棟）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕筧橋空軍軍官學校籃球隊征滬，昨晚作第三次戰，對壘者仁餘晨友聯合組成之「聯靑」隊，上半時廿八比廿三，空校表演極佳，下半時聯靑整頓陣容，全力猛襲，終得反敗爲勝，結果爲五十一比四十二。戰事過程頗爲緊張。</p>

<h3>湖北棉商請願團要求簽訂購棉合約　不達目的將長期留滬力爭到底</h3>

<p>布疋略升</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開時因紡建公司上週間連續拋出大量現貨，客路徐州及蚌埠帮等頭寸軋緊，拋售頻起，號家及散戶亦有斬結，買戶觀望，各貨行情均吿盤低。嗣以業外刺激又重，塲內利買消息頻傳，空方抵補，市氣復見回昂。十二磅龍頭細布做高至三百六十七萬元。</p>
<p>近午業中多頭乘高出籠，微回至三百六十四萬收市。比之週末各檔細布均回漲自十五萬十八九萬十一萬不一。嗶嘰直貢價亦跟好十七八萬元，此外藍布士林布廠方因工料疊增，市步堅挺，民營廠商布疋略有供售，市呈平疲之格。</p>

<h3>統債回跌　外股平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨起跌風，迫於銀根者頗有了結。統丙晨開一一萬八，即吿步降，退　一〇萬六而後轉穩。最後站定於一一萬大關外掙扎。結果較上週六計甲乙低七千元，丙種跌八千元，丁種挫九千元，統戊小六千元，成交六百萬。　外股昨僅橡皮股及怡啤所漲較多，餘股高後漸回，圈外刺激大减，有以致之。銀根緊迫，新買觀望。怡紗晨開一八七萬，中曾創二〇〇萬光景新高峯，而後急回，退至一九〇萬左右掙扎。較上週六計業廣平平，怡啤及橡皮股漲半成，怡紗英聯會德豐紙版航業鋼業電話微升。</p>
<h3>證交流通股款收據　限本月底掉換股票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於市塲洗通股票，原定三月十六日起，一律限以股票交割。刻證交經紀人公會，己商准證交當局，顧念困難，暫准股款收據繼續交割，一面由所方出具收據，一面委請所方代辦調換股票手續，並限於三月底前，各將所方收據，換取正式股票。經紀人公會昨特通函同業査照云。</p>
<h3>人絲上落不多　廠經綢貨喊價高</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市先昂後軟，結果仍較上週末大起五百萬元。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤即期價二億一千四百萬元，隔日期一千八百萬元，旋因銀根緊俏，求脫較多，中午降爲二億〇八百萬元即期價，隔日期喊一千四百萬元。下午曾漲至二千一百萬元，最後又降至一千三百萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市一致上揚，各級喊價比上週六抬高一千萬元之譜。C字喊價三億至三億〇五百萬元，D字在三億元關內，惟均乏成交。高零担價做二億九千八百萬至三億元，中級零担二億九千萬元，共有十餘包交易。干經普通零担二億四千五百萬元有成交。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市向榮，華強被面上午最大價即期為一億〇八百萬元，隔日期爲一千萬元，收市降至一億〇四百五十萬元即期價。下午塲外喊價又高至一千萬元左右。大誠格子　縐上午收市做四十二萬五千元，林記蠟羽紗廠盤廿一萬元，民生競芳呢六十四萬元，華錦縐高檔貨十八萬五千元，其餘各貨，均稍呈堅硬。</p>
<p>茶市盤落</p>
<p>紅綠茶花色，邇因產存趨枯，故執主態度一味堅持，而買戶仍以國內國外去路不絕，遂猶前來頻思染指，做開交易依然缺乏特色，價格方面，一致高峯盤旋。</p>
<h3>臺糖回緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市以進方納胃絞殷，復見回升。公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白由四百六十五萬元升至八十五萬元，四半白五百十萬元至十五萬元。二〇中砂白四百三十萬元至三十五萬元，比魯砂四百四十七萬元至五萬元。棧單交易有一二十萬之迴旋，十一期粗白照加初爲八十五萬元，後爲一百〇五萬元，週四交割由九十八萬元升至一百廿二萬元。十期中砂白一百七十萬元至八十萬元。</p>

<h3>華股趨勢堅俏　永紗等漲停板</h3>
<p>華股昨漲來異常俏利，買戶集中於永紗，餘股在後市較見普遍，漲達限度者甚多。永紗交割流言不一其辭，漲停後轉趨恍惚。</p>
<p>晨開時人心即受股市本身有發展，及自備外匯行將開放等訊而見昂。永紗以一四六〇元及一五七〇元登塲，即一哄而達一五四二元及一六一〇元。旋以逢高脫手，降爲一五二五元及一五九三元，洗言助買，銀根雖緊，仍感炙手可熟。火柴中泥漲達限度，永紗漲到一五七〇元及一六五七元，銀根不易覓得對手，回小到一五五五元及一六四〇元左右。無奈籌碼涸竭，易賣難買，近午浮空急補，永紗竟漲到一六三〇元及一七〇五元結束。餘股除恒豐中興漲停外，雖好而有限，除火柴中泥美亞中興永業漲停外，餘股均好半成至一成不等，遞交股一致漲起一成。</p>
<p>後市開出即昇，永紗即交以一六四二元漲停板上市，遞交則僅一七〇五元，自一七一〇元起，聞所方對永紗之以股票交割延期一週，或所方代辦換股手續之說，退至一六〇八元及一六六三元，繼又進至一六四二元及一七一五元。國行差進甚多，紛紛售現遞，乃跌至一六〇八元及一六五八元，人心尙好。勤興·美亞·恒豐·景福·信和·中絲·中興·新光·中法·內衣·紛吿漲停，尤以勤興有助買訊，更爲俏利。臨收前永紗漲到一六四二元，及一七〇〇元，收市爲一六三八元及一六八二元。較晨收計即交股恒豐·中興·美亞·新光·火柴·景福·信誼·勤興·永業漲停，中泥·中法·中絲·永紗。漲停後微回，統益中紡大通微降，餘股自微升迄半成不等。遞交股美亞漲停板，餘股榮辱俱微，塲外各未上市股票升半成强。</p>
<p>中法美亞今日起以正式股票交割，中紡因未曾函報換股，今起暫停買賣。</p>
<h3>銀根抽緊　門銷清淡　米價普遍下降　麺粉食油轉呈堅昂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米價昨普遍下跌，高貨每擔回落十五萬左右，次貨則下跌二十萬。據分析回小主要原因爲銀根抽緊，買主無力納貨，門銷亦殊淸淡，因之市上一片賣出聲。昨南市登記到貨二八五九石，北市七三五四石五斗。白粳南市交易價三五〇萬，北市三五四萬。特粳南市三六〇萬，北市三七〇萬。薄稻南市三四五萬，北市三四〇萬，早稻南市三三〇萬，北市三二五萬。</p>
<p>又訊：本市民食調配工作連日積極展開，截至十四日止，民調會己配米達三十萬石，全市米店對政府此項政策頗能了解，而與民調會通力合作，市民購得之米，質地良好，凡市民購米達五斗以上者，可免費代送，市民咸稱便利。</p>
<p>麺粉略秀，因北帮乘低納取，故米價雖仍降，而粉市則頹風已除，轉呈堅硬。兵船粉初開一百四十四萬，一度略低至一百四十三萬五千，中途有靑島帮吸進一千餘包，乃吿上升。最後爲一百四十四萬五千。</p>
<p>雜糧漲跌互見，黃豆因漢口等產地價格不賤，貨主扳緊而售。苞米靑島報疲，客帮不納，下落十萬元，揀靑本街胃呆，市呈平疲。芝蔴天津帮停納，跌落十萬元，生仁亦因廣帮無問訊，故市轉疲，略挫十萬元。</p>
<p>食油略昂，以生油上漲較多，因到貨久寂，存底無豆油之豐，供應數量亦少。靑島吉桶生油開市爲八百二十萬，後漲至八百三十萬元。大有豆油初開七百十萬元，收市七百〇五萬。生菜蔴油各昂五萬至十萬元，吉桶小車蔴油以八百萬元成交。豆餅初開尙昂，後汕帮不動，故仍回落，終稍昂五千至萬元。</p>
<p>肥皂又漲</p>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，因黄祥茂廠盤提高至四百二十萬元配出，貨主扳持，同業交易甚暢。結果固本皂亦抬高二十萬爲六百萬元收市，箭刀軋升十萬，祥茂上升十九萬元，此外美麗亦升十萬，餘均步疲。</p>
<p>火柴交易轉稀，行情微見下挫，火油洋燭市平定。</p>

<h3>匹夫有責之原子能問題</h3>
<p>— 李廉太爾原著　陳卓如譯</p>
<p>以爲原子能問題無關大衆的，是一種謬誤的洗行見解。一般人或者說這個問題太專門了，外行對此摸不着頭腦；或者說這個問題有關國防，談來危險。或者說這個問題徒絞腦筋，於事無補，因而主張付之不理。並且脫，這棟緘默辦法在戰時旣甚成功，到今日爲什麽要易絃更轍？</p>
<p>但我則以爲這是不　的；並且對於國人所寳貴的理想是有危險的，因而也就有害於國家的安全。</p>
<p>原子能並不曾改變民主政治的基本原則——其基本爲相信人民的智懸，祗要大家能知道主要的事實。這一原則與這種信仰便是產生原子能委員會的法律基礎。如果人民要這種原則與政策有效——就是人民自身要決定他們自己的將來命運的政策——則這個政策定要行得通。民治的光榮在人民全體的常識判斷可以決定國家的路綫。如此說，原子能便是大家的事。</p>
<p>談到原子能時，你會想到什麽？什九你祗想到原子彈。這很自然。這個原子武器是現實的。我日夜與它爲伍，這雖然不可思議，但實際如此。徒使人害怕得日夜不安，患神經病——這也不是一個辦法，於事終究無補。</p>
<p>原子能產生一種不可想像的破壞武器乃是事實。原子能委員會現在仍在設計，發展，並製造這樣一種武器，我們也決心維持美國在這一方面的優越，直到有效的國際管理能實行時止。這就是一九四六年所通過的原子能法案——麥克馬洪法案——的基本政策。</p>
<p>目下我們對於這種武器的製造所享有獨佔是不會一直下去的，別的國家也能製造原子彈。一且用大量原子彈的戰爭發生，文明無疑地會遭大殃。這便是所以在聯合國中，各個國家都設法並且繼續在設法使原十武器屬於國際有效的共管——但這種努力至今尙未成功而已。</p>
<p>沒有人——我更不——輕視原子能之爲武器的重要。它曾使過去的車政與外交的見解根本動搖。這些事實對於每一個安居樂業的公民是重要的，不問他是住在華盛頓，倫敦，莫斯科或巴黎。</p>
<p>但同樣重要的是；原子能與原子彈不是同義字。老是像大衆這樣淆混地思想下去，要使原子能不爲武器便是困難，我們對於這一個大發明便更難得着其利益了。</p>
<p>原子彈不過是原子能第一次的表演，雖然這些表演有很大的戲劇性，但實際我們所得着的不僅是一個武器。我們從此也得了一種極大而且極普遍的能力的新智識，可與重力，電磁等力相比擬的。</p>
<p>我以爲沒有一種物理性質的東西比太陽還對於人類的福利更重要了。我們從太陽得着我們的一切能力——化學力，創造生命並維持生命的，建築摩天大厦與寺院的，寫詩寫歌曲的。太陽的光便即是生命本身的奇異材料了。</p>
<p>這好似老生常談，但是與原子能的問題很有關係，因生命之源的太陽，也即是一個鉅大的原子能製造廠。太陽所發射出來的能力，其來源便在太陽中靠一種很普通的元素——　—所製造得來的。</p>
<p>所以藏在原子中的能力不是一件希奇事，一點也不新奇。新奇的是在今日，在我們的這一代，知識已加增進到如此程度，我們終於快能了解原子能而且即將使它可以爲人用了。</p>
<p>原子力在今日即最大的科學家仍不完全了解。但這裏有二件很重要的事實爲每一個活着的人所應當知道的。</p>
<p>（一）關於原子能人類在過去卅年比以前幾千年所知道的還多。</p>
<p>（二）再過幾年—所能十年—我們便能解答生命與物質的謎這樣多，它會使我們對于人生有一種新槪念。</p>
<p>我們生長在歷史這一片段是很幸運的，因爲人生的基本知識快爲人類所了解了。</p>
<p>新智識自然會帶來變遷。原子武器使國與國的關係改變，如何維持和平的問題也改變了。原子能改變了人類治病的方法，在目下，放射物質——同位素——加增了我們治癌，醫心病和其它病症的方法（譯者案：例如用放射的碘製成碘化合物，即用以治療甲狀腺上之癌症，因甲狀腺吸收碘，該處的癌便遭其放射而使病者痊愈）。</p>
<p>這些放射的同位素便和那第一個原子彈，在同一個重要的實騐工廠中，同一個原子爐中大量製造出來。放進這個爐子中的物質出爐便有放射性，在某些方面與鐳相同，但其量之多，種類之繁，便與鐳不同了。</p>
<p>這種放射的同位素，今日在醫學中採用了。某種癌病的慢性貧血病（白血球過多症）在Vanderbild大學，便用那原屬國防的原子爐中放射過的金來治療，在紐約的懷恩療癌醫院Memorial　Cancer　Hospital與其他機關也用放射的同位素作某些特殊的癌病的治療用。</p>
<p>現在就說這些治療有某種奇效，未免言之過早。但在醫學與生物學的硏究中，將來在這一方面的希望很大，是已有根據的。由這種方法而得到的人體內部與一般的生物歷程的作用，與外物或疾病對主人體或動物的有機組織的影響，這一切智識皆方興未艾。這種新智識又會基本地影響我們的將來。</p>
<p>在國防部的橡岡Oak　Ridge原子能廠製出來的放射物質現在使我們對於自古以來的生命之謎逐漸有些綫索。例如一桿玉蜀黍如何利用太陽的光綫來製造供給能力的食料？一根植物如何吸收土中的肥料，在植物體中到底有甚麽一種歷程在發生？</p>
<p>在農業中新智識的展望實際無窮，沒有一個範圍的硏究比現在進行中的放射性碳的硏究對于人之了解自然的基本秘密還多希望些——即光化作用的秘密。人從來不知道植物如何利用碳酸氣與水來組合成碳水化合物的。這裏有一種奧秘在。</p>
<p>（譯者按：極微量的放射性原子構成普通化合物，被有機體攝收進云，因爲放射性的存在，我們可以用Geiger測量器，測量這些物質的過程，因而可以看得到這一些物質在有機體內的整個過程。放射物的這種用途，在多方面應用着。）</p>
<p>有些答案或者沒有如此基本，但仍是一般地受人股望的如：怎樣防止虫害，以治虫劑去保護果實，決定植物實際如何利用肥料和一些有關的問題，都靠用放射性同位素來解決。這些問題可以大影響世界的食物來源，因而對於世界和平是一重要步驟。</p>
<p>我們說用在原子能硏究的整個費用—到現在止已用去廿五萬萬美元—即就其在農業與人類營義上所得到的益處便可補償而有餘了，這一點也不是誇大的話。</p>
<p>這種輻射的過程將來有許多用處。普通的和不大知道的原子經撞擊後會在工業中另關新天地。我們現在用放射性鋼來硏究抗擦承軸爲什麽遭消磨，因爲我們用放射鋼便可測量摩擦兩面所掉下來的點點金屬，微至千萬萬分之一英兩，亦可量出。煉鋼工業也可以將煉鋼爐裏的鐵與渣中問的硫磺交換過程控制得絲毫不爽，因爲我們現在利用放射性鐵與探硫　Sulfer　Tracer研究的緣故。</p>
<p>在Wisco　in大學，他們用在橡岡鏈鎖反應機所產生的放射同位素來硏究玻璃與金屬的表面現象，科學家開始知道有一層薄不足道的外來分子與游子積在玻璃和金屬的表面。這種智識使我們知道如何製造好些的鏡子，改良電鍍，對於擦洗劑的製造很可能有甚大的發展。</p>
<p>放射性同位素在核反　機中，即普通一般人所謂堆Pile的，產生出來。（所調堆，用一層石墨—做鉛筆用的—又夾上一層鈾而成爲一大堆（這個准，從外表看，好像一個沒有窗戶的堆棧。在裏面，如果在反應進仃時，極强烈的放射好像有若干噸鐳在放射般。（但在全美國，可用的鈾一共不過二十五英兩）。這種自發的核鏈鎖反應機在這裏做三種事：</p>
<p>（一）它產生鋍，一種新元素，可爲其他反應機或武器用。</p>
<p>（二）它產生熱，將來有一天可以用來作　動力的。</p>
<p>（三）它產生中子的輻射，一種不可見而運動極速的分子。（未完）</p>
<h3>印度的宗教糾紛</h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>甘地之死，死於政治的原因，也是死於宗敎的原因。印度的政治鬥爭，本質上就是宗敎的鬥爭。在宗敎鬥爭史上，洗血的事件不知多少，甘地之死，如果作爲一個殉敎者來看，這尙不能表現甘地的偉大。甘地的偉大是在能超出宗敎糾紛之外而謀解決宗敎的糾紛。</p>
<p>然而甘地畢竟沒有解決印度的宗敎糾紛，這原因何在呢？這是作者想在這裏略加說明的。從歷史上看來，宗敎糾紛是一種無法解決的糾紛。其所以無法解決的理由，一是由於一般宗敎的本質，二是由於印度宗敎的特徵，把這兩點略加解釋，我們對於印度的宗敎糾紛便能有較淸楚的認識。</p>
<p>宗敎是以情感爲本質的，其目標在尋求人類情志的慰勉。人類所以需要宗敎，或宗敎之所以發生，即因人類情　上有所不安，特別是對於死生之際，感覺困惑。由於這種不安，人類力有宗敎的需求。在萬事如意，志悅情怡的狀態中，宗敎似乎是不必要的。人類需要宗敎時，他的情感必有問題。是以不信宗敎則已，信則其情感特强。宗敎上的一切儀式，多志在引起人類的情感，而其教義，也多在滿足人類的情感。普通情感，多旋生旋滅，缺少持續性，唯宗敎的情感，則常持續不斷，不易消失。同時，宗敎的情感也比任何其他情感爲强。因此，宗敎和宗敎間的鬥爭，就是情感和情感間的鬥爭。這種鬥爭，常不是理性所能解決的。蓋唯理性能聽命於理性，而情感便不易聽命於理性。這種鬥爭，也常不是另一情感所能解決的。情感或能聽命於相同的情感，却不易聽命於不同的情感。甘地之所以不能解決印度的宗教糾紛，這可以說是一種原因。</p>
<p>次則，印度的宗敎糾紛，乃回敎和印度敎及佛敎間的糾紛。根據漢哲諾索洛（Northrop）的意見，人類宗敎可分為兩大類：一類是有神的宗敎（TheisticReigions），另一類是非有神的宗敎（Non-theistic　Religions）。基督敎，回敎等屬於前一類，而印度敎，佛敎，，孔敎，道敎，則屬於後一類。前一類的宗敎，即有神的宗敎，其特徵是：都有侵略性的，都有傳敎的熟誠的，也都視異敎爲異端，爲錯誤，爲卑劣的。他們均自視其敎義爲絕對完全，而其敎徒則受神命，有以「唯一完全的宗教」去代替其他宗敎的義務。因而這一類的宗敎，態度狹隘，不能容忍，極難和他敎合作。反之，後一類的宗敎，即非有神的宗敎，便沒有侵略性，缺少傳敎的熱誠，也較能尊重其他的宗敎。這一類的宗敎，態度開明，心胸寬闊，較易和他敎合作。佛敎和基督敎到中國，不會引起嚴重的糾紛，即因中國本身的宗敎是非有神的。可是印度本身的宗教，如回敎，是有神的，而其敎徒復有相當的數目，相當的力量，所以要他們和印度等合作，即極困難。這樣，印回分治是必然的，而甘地的失敗，也是必然的。</p>
<h3>審美底對象與情感之合一</h3>
<p>— 韓裕文</p>
<p>審美底情是對於一個對象的情，同時，審美底對象是審美底情之具體地表現。所以審美底情和審美底對象有合一底關係。</p>
<p>按常識，情是主觀的，對象是客觀的，二者怎樣能合而爲一呢？有人以為審美者底情感生於審美者之筋肉底變化，對象裏的情是由審美者底情移轉到對象裏去的。例如李味嫩（Vernon　Lee）說，你在地平綫上看見一座山的時候，你覺得那座山從平地上升起來了。這個上升底觀念充滿了各種生　，精力和勇氣底聯想。所以你看見那座山的時候就對牠有情感，並且以爲牠是具有某種性格的。你底所以這樣感想，是因爲當你翹首仰望那座高山的時候，由於你底翹首仰望等等肌肉底動作而有一種升騰底情感，於是你無意識地把你這種情感以及你在這種情形下想像到的意義去形容那座山，因此你就覺得那山有情了。對於山是這樣對於其他的對象也是這樣。當你靜觀對象，特別是靜觀綫條和樣式底系統時，你對於那對象底形式，身體上總有相應的緊張或術動：或升或降，或突進，或交錯，或互相阻碍。這些情形就是你用以構成你底對象及其情感的材料。</p>
<p>李味嫩還有一個與此類似的例子。他說，這裏有一個普通的陶瓷花瓶。當你看到牠的時候，你就對牠發生一種特殊的全體底感覺。你首先兩脚踏地，兩眼釘着那個花瓶底底子。於是你捧起那個花瓶來，同時挺起了你底身體，並且那花瓶對稱的兩邊使你左右兩邊的肺和牠們共同地活動。當你底眼睛從瓶底順着那個花瓶外行的曲綫向瓶口移動時，你就要向你底肚子裏吸氣了。這種情形就好像我們要自造一個花瓶以便浸沒到牠裏邊去而與之結合一樣。</p>
<p>對於情感和對象之台一的這種解釋的確很生動，很動人聽聞，但鮑桑克以爲，第一，這個學說，太重視綫條和樣式底地位了。雖然樣式是我們了別形式的一個初步的象徵，但若以爲空間的樣式就是審美底形式却是一個很大的誤會。何况綫條和樣式並不比色彩和聲調更能表現審美底形式呢。色彩底深淺和對比。聲調底和諧，與空間裏的樣式，時間裏的　律同樣是審美底形式；後者並不比前者更優越。第二，綫條和樣式等所引起我們身體底緊張和運動也不是人人都一樣的。並且我們實際上的想像或知覺也不必這些細節底帮助，事實上這些細節反到妨礙我們底想像和知覺。</p>
<p>密拆爾（Mitchell）還有一個例子。他說，我們對於一條優雅　曲綫發生樂趣時，我們底眼睛是隨着那條曲綫轉動的。我們底樂趣就是在這眼睛底轉動裏感覺到的，同時我們就在這個情形下把我們底樂趣移轉爲我們底對象底性質了。但是鮑桑克以爲事情並不是這樣簡單的。當我們欣賞一條曲綫時，我們底眼睛確乎是隨着那條曲綫轉動的，但眼睛底筋肉僅僅是個感覺底移動機，而那條曲綫却不僅僅是一個感覺底對象，而且是一個知覺底對象；我們底想像加給那條曲綫的性格，無疑地是從我們整個的經驗而來的，我們沒有理由說牠是從眼睛底運動產生的。我們愉快的情感要變爲對象底一個特性，當然我們得生活在那個對象底細節裏，但是要達到這個地步，我們必須有全體的想像。那就是說，情感與對象底合一是整個審美底想像底結果而不是肌肉活動底結果。對象裏的情固然有牠底主觀性，但也有牠底客觀性。其實我們在對象裏看出情趣來，和我們在對象裏看見顏色和樣式，聽着聲音一樣的情形。因此我們如何把情歸於對象，和我們如何把顏色，聲音，樣式歸於對象一樣，無需兩種不同的理論來解釋。</p>
<h3>談學與術</h3>
<p>— 少雄</p>
<p>學術二字的涵義，表明了一種主要的眞理，就是理論與實踐並重，或知與行並重的眞理。「學」所以明其理，是理論方面的事，也就是知之事。「術」所以實現其理，或應用其理，是實踐方面的事，也就是行之事。有學而無術，不可，有術而無學，更不可。學與術不能分，分則兩敗俱傷，各無所成。</p>
<p>中西文化的差異，從學與術之分與不分這一點，便可看出。一般而論，西洋文化是學與術不分離，學與術並重的文化。希臘人在學的方面曾有輝煌的成就。希臘人重窮理，重爲知識而求知識，故在理論方面創造了不少思想上的系統。西洋文化之有今日，希臘人的貢獻當然是不能忽視的。不過希臘人的貢獻似只限於學，而尙未至乎術，希臘人沒有把學與術充分的聯繫起來，其學仍恃玄想，而少實驗，結果其學也就受了限制，不能有長足的進展。所以柏拉岡和亞里士多德的哲學雖控制了整個中世紀，而中世紀在學的方而依然很少貢獻。直到文藝復興和工業革命之後，西洋人才知道學與術的關聯，才知道把學與術密切的聯繫起來。一方而重視學，重視純理論的探討，另一方面也重視術，重視實踐上的應用。在理論方面有新的發現時，在實踐方面也隨即有新的應用。學所以啓發術，使術得從理論的啓示而獲得新的應用之道。術所以證實學或否定學，使學可從實踐上的順利或困難而獲得進步之道。故有術而無學，則術止於一技之長，不能有新的發現。有學而無術，則學止於空洞之理論，亦不能有新的進展。促使學與術的共同進步，術須輔以學，而學亦須輔以術。近百年來西洋文化的進展，其主要之秘密在此。</p>
<p>反之，中國文化所以停滯而不能進展的主要原因，就是，因爲中國文化乃學與術分離了的文化。中國文化一方面似乎偏重學，另一方而又似乎偏重術。謂中國文化是重學的，這自然不甚確切。但調中國文化是重術的，這也不甚確切。實際是中國文化有學，而學不能輔之以術，有術，而術亦不能輔之以學。談學問的人，尙空談，重玄想，而其玄想又如無　之馬，不受方法的控制，不受事實的約束，結果，便多洗於幻想。故即在學的方面，中國亦不能超出西洋。這是有學而無術之弊。術的方面，中國在過去確曾有過驚人的貢獻。如指南針，火藥，印刷術的三大發明，這是中國人可以自豪的。然而拔止乎此，現在這些發明上的進步，却在西洋而不在中國。理由是，中國人的術，多不輔之以學，雖有某某之術，却無某某之學。例如，能造屋而無造屋之學，能造橋亦無造橋之學。術不進乎學，術乃故步自封，永無進展。這是有術而無學之弊。因而，中國文化便成爲，非有學而無術，即有術而無學，學術始終是分離的。學與術分離，便學不進步，而術亦止乎所己有。</p>
<p>由是以談，中國文化的一種出路，即在學與術的密切聯繫上。我們不能重學而不重術，更不能重術而不重學。學與術合一，方能產生眞正的「學術」。</p>
<h3>學林樷話（十三）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>現代歐美思潮（上）</p>
<p>英國羅士培（R．M．Roxby）敎授會稱三民主義是東西思想的綜合，融會了中國固有傳統與十九世紀至二十世紀初年歐美的思想和經驗，這是很公允的見解。我們要充分了解三民主義，自應以整個世界學術文化爲其背景。本篇以羅素新著西洋哲學史（一九四四年十月出版）爲依據，把近代歐美思潮歸納爲八大派，略作紹介，以供參考比較的資料，對於三民主義的理想，或可藉此有深一層的認識。</p>
<p>（一）自由主義　自由主義與英國經臉派同出於一源。洛克（John　lock一六三二至一七〇四）在智識論爲經驗派開山大師，在政治哲學上又爲自由主義的先驅。西洋近代談民主政治的人，莫不推祟洛克。他的學說奠定了英國的民治，並且引起美國和法國的大革命，影響至爲深遠。洛克的思想方法是實驗的，嘗試的，錙銖積累，一如科學工作，以爲政治應受理性的支配，注重證據，注重討論，不尙權威，不主武斷，而相信漸進的改革。一六八八年（前淸康熙二十七年）的英國革命是最溫和最成功的革命，洛克鼓吹之功最大，又於其所著「政府論」一書（Treati　es　on　Government上下二册，一六八九與一六九〇年出版）充分發揮英國革命的精神。是　攻擊君主，貶斥世襲權制，主張言論自由，在政治思想上有極重要的地位。英國內亂時期，王室與國會的衝突，勢均力敵，養成調和妥協不趨於極端的心理，這種國民心習一直傳到如今。洛克以爲要使他人改變其信念，必須循循善誘，忠吿面善導之，不能遽斥他人爲頑固，甚或加以壓迫。凡能虛懷求知之人必不欲强他人以從已。又謂我們在信仰眞理之中，不能不帶有幾分懷疑成分。此種心情與宗敎之寬容有關，而爲英國巴力門政治的精義所在。自由主義的作風奠定了英國長治久安的基礎。洛克「政府論」所創的分權原則與制衡作用，實爲近代民洽思潮的主流，尤其是美國實行得最爲圓滿。美國總統國會和大理院，確立了三權鼎立的尊嚴，當總統與國會職權發生衝突之時，常採取洛克學說以爲準繩，在美國歷史上以干戈相見者只有一次。羅素於洛克學說最爲津津樂道，以爲要期望世界和平，極權的思想必須廢棄，將來如果有世界政府的創立，分權的制度依舊可以適用。但是自由主義幷非無懈可擊。早期自由主義代表的英國新敎徒，他們雖然富於平民色彩，而財產觀念常佔重要地位。洛克的民治論，以私有財產爲基礎。一六八八年英國革命原爲英國貴族與中產階級（巨商大賈）聯合反對君主的三角關係。洛克以後的自由主義者，代表英國新興的工商業，他們反對君主與書族，但不反對地主與資本家，因此自由主義與資本主義有關帶的關係。羅素批評資本主義有云：「政治權力不能世襲，何以經濟權力可以世襲？在政治方而已經取消了世襲原則，而在經濟方面仍視世襲爲當然。政治上的朝代已經過去，而經濟上的朝代依然存在。」這是極警闢的議論，指出了自由主義的缺點。</p>
<p>（二）浪漫主義　與自由主義相對抗者爲浪漫主義。法人盧騷（Rousseau一七一二至一七七八）的學說，訴諸感情，直指人心，爲浪漫運動的開創者。此派不喜早期的工業文明，含有反科學反理性的色彩。英人拜倫（Byron一七八八至一八二四）爲浪漫派的詩人，卡來爾（Carlyle一七九五至一八八一）提倡英雄崇拜之說，因文字的鼓吹而聲勢漸盛。十九世紀初年，德國還未統一，以普魯十爲中心的德國史學，倡導民族主義。斐希特（Fichte一七六二至一八一四）與黑格爾（Hegel一七七〇至一八三一）謳歌國魂，爲普魯士的代言人，到了俾斯麥之手乃完成德國統一的大業。民族主義趨於極端，便成爲民族至上論，與英雄崇拜論在思想上爲同調。至於浪漫主義　學基礎的確立，則有賴於德人叔本華（Schopenhauer一七六二至一八一四）與尼采（Nitzsche一八四四至一九〇〇）。此一派的折學，注重意志，傾　權力，感情衝動，達於狂熱的境界。又受達爾文學說的暗示，主張　限制的競爭，以戰爭爲英勇，以和平思想爲不足貴。自十八世紀後半期以至今日，文學藝術與哲學以至政治，均直接　接受浪漫運動的影響，風發雲　，洪水滔滔，其末洗之弊即爲納粹主義與法西斯主義，對內則主張極權政治，對外則主侵略政策。因爲浪漫派以民族利益爲最高法律，使獨裁者得利用之以自附於代表民意。浪漫派把權力寄托在少數民族中少數個人，不惜憑藉暴力以達到此目的。所以一切權術霸道，窮兵黷武，自爲勢所必至。浪漫主義與自由主義的最大區別在其偏重情感，趨於極端。羅素以爲感情浮露而易致，理智深沈而難能。感情獨來獨往，理性必須與人共之。感情只顧目前，理性必須計及未來。人類非能遺世獨立，如欲與人爲善，便不能專主感情。盧騷爲浪漫運動之父，由今觀之，臘騷之說貌似倡導民治，實際往往足以爲極權國家張目。羅素於尼采之流尤痛斥其非，謂在尼采觀之，林肯卑下，拿破崙偉大。他們心目中只有普遍的仇恨與恐懼，而無普遍的同情與愛。專從痛苦着想，欲致八於死地，蔑視仁愛的德性，不　此實世界所由立。尼采學說可謂此路不通，納粹德國之覆亡即其明證。羅素以希特勒爲盧騷之裔孫，羅斯福與邱吉爾爲洛克之傳人。洛克一派習於人情世故，多平正通達之人，尙理智，貴實驗，重討論，其於增進人類福利，致力較多。浪漫派但重國家，不重國民，歌頌英雄，高呼犧牲，積漸而成爲世界大戰的禍首。這二派之思想上涇謂分明，不能等量齊觀。</p>

<h3>生產正義</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>一人取了他人的東西，必須付人以相當的代價。我們如果需要享受，自然應該以工作去換取之，這是天經地義的眞理。因爲取了人家的東西而不給代價，或是祗知享樂而不知工作，此乃表示社會上苦樂的不勻，一方面是享受太過，而另一方面是負擔過重。須知我之所得，即是人之所失。</p>
<p>俗諺有云：「無功不受祿。」可是我們只須閉目一想，便可知道社會上有許多人是受的祿太多，而所獻的功與所受的祿殊不相稱。但思吾人吃的穿的住的，那一件不是取給於人？然而吾人對於被取給的社會究竟已是貢獻了些什麼呢？這麽一想，社會上有些人實在是應該愧死。</p>
<p>或謂一人之所吃所穿所住，自然是付了金錢的代價然後取得的，人們那里肯給你白吃白穿白住呢？只是我們得進一步問：閣下的金錢是怎樣獲得的？如果是因巧取豪奪，像用囤積的方法，或是投機的手段，而獲得了巨額的金錢，那末這樣的獲得只能名之日「不勞而獲」。這樣的代價，非吾之所謂對於社會的貢獻。蓋囤囤貨，投投機，固也可以獲利，甚之或可獲得大利，甚之是目前情勢之下惟一可以獲得大利的方法，可是其所獲之利畢竟是從不囤楨不投機的人們那里剝削而來的。</p>
<p>我們應該知道我們吃的食糧，穿的衣服，住的房屋，都不是天上落下來的，而是人們生產出來製造出來的。所以我們也必須從事生產從事製造，然後才可以償付所吃所穿所住的代價。朱子家訓：「一絲一縷，應知物力維艱，一粥一飯，當思來處不易」，這是敎人節約；社會上一般的人大都是取之於社會者多，而所貢獻於社會者少，那里可以再事浪費呢？不過這點還只是偏重於消極的節省物資。從積極方面着想，我們實在還是應該去從事生產，生產的量至少應該足以抵償我們自己的消耗。俗諺之所謂「飯　」，所謂「衣服架子」，據我看來，便是指那一類只知消費，不事生產的人們。</p>
<p>只是何謂生產？若何才可謂對社會眞有貢獻？這點却也不易爲之下一個定義。農夫胼手胝足，替我們生產了五穀，這當然是實實在在的生產。商人把一地所餘之貨搬運到缺貨的另一地去，經濟得以調劑，這也可以算是不無貢獻於社會。至於工廠從業員們把原料變成製成品，把原來效用未著的東西變成能够發生效能的物品，這當然也是生產之一道。</p>
<p>準此，對於「生產」與「貢獻」雖不易下定義，却也不是沒法找出一個「生產」與「非生產」或「貢獻」與「非貢獻」的標準來。愚意；凡是有益於生靈的東西，吾人使其自「無」而至「有」，此即是生產；凡是有實益於社會大衆的事，我們便可稱之曰「貢獻」。比方建造房屋，此乃使一件有利於生靈的東西，自「無」而至「有」，有實益於人們，此乃「生產」；如果把原有上好的房屋去毁損了，姑不論其目的何在，說得婉轉一點，不節約的罪名總是難逃了吧？</p>
<p>依此標準說來，老實說，今日許多之所謂有職業的人們是不配稱之爲「生產者」的。査今日的環境，實在也不利於生產，於是乎有許多人便去從事囤積與投機，有許多公司行號，考其實際只是囤積投機的機關。這類公司行號聘請了經理夥計，他們自然天天在工作，月月在支薪，可是何能稱之曰「生產者一？</p>
<p>眞正的所謂生產，並不是指「權子母」積私財。須知「賺錢」與「生產」未必是一件事，正如節的並不是指節的金錢而是指物資一樣。生產應該是生產物資，不是生產金錢。</p>

<h3>「傳說」</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>我們的國家數千年來始終信仰「柔能克剛」的哲學，萬事不可太露　芒，處世以圓滑爲上，做事應該如此，說話也是這樣，諺云：「是非只爲多開口」，禍從口出，所以無論如何，話總是少說爲妙，即使不得已非說不可的時候，也要說得兩面沾光，不着邊際，無關痛癢，似是而非。這就是說話的藝術，至於眞實性和言行符合與否，倒是次要的條件，可有可無，不必深加留意的。</p>
<p>根據物理學的原理，　的東西摩擦力最少，事理亦然，能够圓到，便沒有碰壁的危險，尤其是步步荆棘的路上，方頭方腦，不免皮破血洗；一圓之後，就能够路路俱通。據說火燒的時候，被困在裘面的人，以滾出來最爲安全，惟圓能滾，所以也就可以出入危險而不損毫髮。說話要做到圓的地步，根據我的經驗，認爲最便捷簡單的方法，就是冠以「傳說」二字。</p>
<p>在數千萬的語彙裏，一傳說」這二個字再妙不過。一句話加上「傳說」，便化爲三分神秘三分疑惑三分眞實和一分誘惑，假使話說得對，便大大地替自己吹上一通，萬一有錯，那也沒有關係，「道聽塗聞，不足信也。」永遠不會禍延自身，或有什麽「喪邦」之危險的。</p>
<p>何况「傳說」的力量極大，幾個「傳說」一來縱然完全無稽，聽的人也不免信疑參半起來。因而「傳說」之風大盛，久而久之，便成爲一種時尙習慣。當然，「傳說」還有許多外號別名，例如「似乎」「也許」「恐怕」「大的」「可能」「彷彿」「好做」「差不多」之類，都是一而二，二而一的東西。</p>
<p>可惜的是這一套法寳被人用得太濫，便不免减少它的效學，好像圓的車輪，用久了也就不免粗糙，雖然言語都戴着「傳說」的帽子，不幸人們眼睛的鑒辨力相對增高，於是到最後眞的眞，們的僞，依然原形畢露，難作混珠的魚目了。</p>
<h3>暇</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>別小　了彎腰曲　的蝦，他使人類一年發生六千萬元美金的商業交易呢！而且，他的家族還是海洋世界中的最繁衍者之一。</p>
<p>一條蝦從生到　　個的壽命僅祗一年，但是，一條雌蝦一生却能下子五十萬顆。不過，平均下來，其中有四十九萬九千九百九十八顆是要夭折的，得以克享天年的僅有兩顆。雖然如此，蝦依然是海中的大族，並且在淡水中亦有繁殖，比一般的鹹水動物適應環境的力量强得多。</p>
<p>蝦的種類繁多，細小的直如一根頭髪，碩大的却體重一磅。胚胎期的鹹水蝦竟然能够生存在溫度低至攝氏零下一百九十度的液體空氣中。有一種還會爬樹。</p>
<p>數年前，美國紐奧連斯郊區的家庭，遭受大批的不知名的小生物的侵製，他們在地板上劈拍作聲，主婦都以爲是跳蝨來了。後來，經過生物學家的分析，才知道這些跳跳蹦蹦的小動物原來是一種暇。</p>
<p>世界上各地的海洋中都充滿了暇。這種現象對一八八〇年阿道爾夫·格里萊將軍的北極探險隊有極大的價値。探險隊一共備足了兩年的糧食，不幸他們因迷途而被困於冰天雪地的北極達三年之久。在斷糧的時期，他們就以捕捉小蝦維持生命。吃了一年小蝦之後，後來在美西戰爭中博獲英名的溫斐爾。許雷司令將探險隊從困境中拯救出來，不過，二十五個團員己餓死十八人；剩下來的七個人如果沒有小蝦救命，恐怕也早己變成凍死骨了。</p>

<h3>飛行醫院</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>在美國南達柯塔州鋸齒狀的黑山山麓，有一個熈熈攘攘的近代化小城，它的名字呌賴庇德，擁有一萬四千名的人口，其中有一位就是名聞遐邇的佛拉德·明第醫生—美國稗史中的「歹土」（Badlands）的飛行醫生。在一九〇七年，當明第開始懸壺行醫的時候，山區中連電話的名字都未聽見過。有時候，郊區的居民爲了請醫生，需要跋涉一百哩路，一來回就是兩百哩，催馬加鞭的趕路也需要一整天的時間。如果病况不過分沉重，也許還有救，否則醫生就難免徒勞往返了。假使將病人裝在火車中去就醫，不用說時間的耽擱，就是路上的震動也足以促短病人的生命。</p>
<p>目睹此情的明第，立志要爲病家造福。在一九一三年，他買下了他的第一架飛機，祗是請駕駛員將飛機從機塲輸送到他的故鄉，就花了他二千五百美金。可是，這架草創時期的飛機未經正式使用，便在初次的降落中掩毁了。</p>
<p>到了一九二七年，明第認淸飛機的效率業已增進，便買了一架小型機。那時，他自己還不會駕駛，於是僱了一個駕駛員。有了飛機之後，他在一小時之內便可趕到離醫院最遠的病人的家中了。</p>
<p>不過，小型機有不少缺點。第一，因爲整個的機身是露天的，所以不能適宜於南達柯塔的酷寒的冬季氣候。其次，載重量過小。有一次，他想把一個體重兩百磅的胖病人載入飛機，可是，這架爲兩個人而造的小飛機竟被壓得飛不起來。經過這次的敎訓之後，明第決心學習駕駛。他眞的成了飛機駕駛員。</p>
<p>到了現在，明第已有三架飛機。最新的一架是四座機，設備得如同一輛飛行救護車，裝有舁牀和急救的醫院設備。他把醫藥界的技巧和舒適帶到住在離最近的醫院有數百哩之遙的家庭中。</p>
<p>有一個十八個月大的小孩子，不愼吞下一枚釘子，他的父母急電明第醫生求救。明第架機來了，他把病兒和他的父親一併載回醫院去。同時，憂慮的母親則駕駛汽車到醫院去探聽究竟。當她趕到醫院的時候，明第已經行過緊急手續，小病人正在休養之中。</p>
<p>從未有過任何病人拒絕飛行，也從未發生過飛機　撞的慘劇，雖然有過許多次死裏逃生的飛行。</p>
<p>有一次，明第醫生收到一個住在百哩之外的峻峭的高原的頂上的家庭打來的急電。高原上風勢猛烈，他們在曬衣繩上掛了一方白被單指示風向，使醫生得以安全的降陸。</p>
<p>病人經過檢騐和載入飛機之後，風勢更大，飛機必需滑行五百呎之內就上昇，否則便有衝撞山石的危險。好幾個年靑力壯的牧童拉住了飛機的尾部，直到引擎獲得最高的速度才鬆手。</p>
<p>飛機怒吼的越過田野，來到高聳的懸崖邊緣。可是引擎還未曾發揮到上昇的速度，而停止也來不及了。明第沉着氣，越過懸崖的邊緣，使飛機緊貼地面沿着陡坡向下俯衝。當機身離下面的尖銳的巖石似乎祗有一吋光景時，引擎終於發揮到最高度，飛機轉而上昇了。在這千鈞一髮的時候，病人不斷的禱吿着，一且脫離了險境，他鬆口氣說：「現在好了，上帝，我不再需要你了。」</p>

<h3>浪者的郵局</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>華盛頓第三街有一家藍滿書店（Raymer＇s　Bookshop），兼營郵箱事業。地理上奇奇怪怪的地名，和特別的要求，在藍滿書店是極尋常的事。譬如說，有一個消息，藍滿書店有一顧客從馬薩斯州的朗曼度搬到了剛果的共瓜黑德，對於他們並不驚奇。某一顧客因爲出門過一個時期，回來之後到藍滿書店去收集堆積的郵件，也許要用一輛汽車裝載回去。另一顧客經常到書店裏來走走，已有二十五年歷史，但却從未收到過一封寄在藍滿書店裏的信。</p>
<p>書店的原主人就名雷滿，他首先創辦信箱服務，已於數年前逝世。繼承者是却爾遜先生，一仍舊貫，辦理代收信件，今日業務擴充，已有六百顧客，顧客每年納費三元，留下永久地址，由他們自行到店中來收信，但要求書店把信件送到他們府上者，亦可照辦。有的人因爲常常變更住址，普通郵件難以按址送達，所以非用書店信箱不可。有的人因爲沒有固定家室，或不願把眞實地址給朋友或敵人知道，所以要用書店信箱。却爾遜和郵政局訂有負責信件的契的，但於地址絕對保守秘密，僅是遇到聯邦偵察局的人員偶然前來査詢時，不得不透露而已。</p>
<p>藍滿先生開始這種服務於一九〇九年，完全是偶然的計劃，當時有一流浪者要求藍滿，可否利用書店作爲通信地址，藍滿答應下來，便是開辦信箱的發軔。後來要求以書店爲信箱者續有增加，於是收費以爲限制，每年納費是美金二元。現在書店裏的信箱出租者已達六百隻，尙有四百隻空箱等待新顧客來租用。信件可以直接由顧客來收取，但也可以代爲轉寄到世界上任何一處顧客的所在地去。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>萍水姻緣　（九九）</p>
<p>大凡一個女人，在重大刺激之下，有人能和她表同情，能安慰她的精神痛苦，很容易認這人是知己。綺紈在醫院，在百無聊賴，寂寞煩鬱之中，島雲乘虛而入，捉住了她的心靈，她此時祗覺得島雲漂亮，溫和，多情，熱心，是一個前途很有作爲的靑年，並且彼此職業，是站在一條綫上的，嫁給他，進可以做一位出風頭的明星，退也不失爲一富商的少奶奶，前途很光明的，尤其是對於自己目前環境，非常有益。綺紈這時祗往獎滿方面着想，其他都未加考察，心裏祗在盤算，不久工夫，島雲已推門進來，此次身上已脫下睡衣，換上一套整飭的西服，頭髮也梳得非常光充，走到床前，說道：「請你原諒，我心急如火，這半個鐘頭，似有半年一般，我忍耐不住，又走進來。想顧小姐一定給我一個很滿意的答覆。」說着，低着頭，看着床上的綺紈的臉。只見她眼睛閉一閉，重復睜開，向島雲拋了一眼，微微一笑，朮復閉上，島雲知道她己心許。他對於這種經驗是很豐富的，當下刻不容緩地，俯身下去，雙手搭在綺紈的肩上，在她臉上一吻。綺紈睜開眼來說道：「你就這樣纏人，我的心給你弄得很亂了！」島雲見大功業已吿成，很得意地微微笑道：「現去我們要討論結婚問題了。我們是在北平還是到上海去？」綺紈眼球動一動，凝神一會，說：「我想到香港去最好。」島雲現出躊躇的樣子，一手摸着頭，說道：「香港也很好，只是不如上海便利。」綺紈道：「我認爲在香港於我便利，因爲我的母親現在上海，我打算在香港結婚之後，再到上海見我母親，母親見我已經結婚，他就有什麽異議，見已成事實，她也就不會反對了。」島雲聽了，險色微微一變，說道：「這話也對。」綺紈道：「你覺得在香港結婚，有什麽不方便？」島雲道：「我……我也爲的父母在香港，我也是打算結婚後再禀明父母。」綺紈聽了，倒覺得爲難起來，說道：「你覺得在上海方便，我覺得不方便；我覺得在香港方便，你又覺不方便。這可難了！」</p>

<h3>The Situation in Luoyang Stabilizes, Reinforcements Arrive, Launching Internal and External Attacks, the Core Positions Are Now Unassailable by the Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 15th] Luoyang is still at a critical juncture. The main force of the bandits, relying on artillery fire, fiercely attacked three core positions of the National Army. The National Army fought bravely, holding their positions as before. National Army reinforcements have already repelled one division of the Bandit Third Column west of Yanshi. Other lightly equipped, rapid-response units are attacking the bandit strongholds. The fierce fighting inside and outside Luoyang is about to merge into a single battle.</p>

A portion of the bandits attacking Luoyang have already retreated southward. The core positions within the city appear to be unshakeable by the bandits. The bandits amassed a large number of cannons, but their bombardment was unsuccessful, and their encirclement from all sides also failed. On the morning of the 15th, they repeatedly launched desperate attacks, only to be defeated again. Under the internal and external attacks, the bandits will find it difficult to escape the fate of defeat.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] As the Shaanxi-Henan war continues, the Xi'an Air Force is massing.

<h3>National Representatives from National Occupational Groups Begin to Receive Election Certificates, Principles Determined for Travel Expenses of National Representatives from Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the issuance of election certificates to national representatives from national occupational and women's groups, it is learned that the National Occupational and Women's Election Office has received a telegram from the General Election Office, instructing them to issue certificates as soon as possible. The office is now distributing telegrams to election offices in various provinces and cities to notify and announce the elected candidates (the corrected list shall prevail for those who need to be corrected). They are required to prepare two recent 2.5-inch headshots and obtain certificates from the provincial and municipal election offices, and come to Beijing before the meeting to collect the certificates themselves to show caution. The office has also sent the entire roster to the Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly. Representatives can obtain convenient transportation and hospitality from the National Assembly Reception Center if they inquire nearby.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The registration date for National Assembly representatives has been decided to begin on the 18th. The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly has now drafted the registration procedures for representatives.

It is estimated that 500 people can be registered each day. If representatives do not need accommodation, it will only take two minutes for each person to complete the registration.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The standards for travel expenses for National Assembly representatives have been drafted by the Preparatory Committee. The main points are as follows: (1) The standards for domestic travel expenses will be determined separately for three to five concentration points in each province, and the number of concentration points will be increased with reference to the "Table of Division of Electoral Districts for Provincial Chairmen"; (2) These standards are based on the prices of boats, trains, and planes on February 29th. Train fares are based on first class, ship fares are based on special class, and plane fares are based on regular flights. If transportation fares increase after March 1st, adjustments will be made; (3) The transportation situation from the representative's township to the concentration point is unclear, so two or three days, up to six days, of travel expenses have been added to the standards based on the distance of the journey, at a rate of 300,000 yuan per day. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>A Compromise Plan is Drafted to Handle the Issue of Concessions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Standing Committee of the Kuomintang Central Committee held a regular meeting on the 15th, chaired by Fan Yusu, to discuss the election and concession issues of the National Assembly representatives. After three hours, it was decided to dispatch important personnel to invite representatives from both the signatories and the nominees who are currently in Beijing to hold talks. On the one hand, they will continue to persuade them. If they agree at that time, there will be no problem. If they insist on not conceding, the signatory representatives can be given a two-year term, and the remaining four years will be conceded to the centrally nominated candidates. However, before the National Assembly session, the application for concession must be submitted to the Kuomintang Central Committee for record. Otherwise, the Central Committee will copy the list to the Central Supervisory Committee for punishment, that is, expulsion from the party. After being expelled from the party, their status will not be bound by the party. Although this principle has been internally determined, the Central Committee still hopes that party members can voluntarily concede to respect party discipline. This meeting will be held in the afternoon of the 16th, and the central officials will be Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Shao Lizi, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, and He Zhonghan.</p>

<p>The Diplomatic Authorities Are Studying Countermeasures</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the incident of Soviet aircraft shooting at Chennault's Air Transport Group aircraft, the Soviet side has submitted a reply after we protested to the Soviet Union. This matter was confirmed by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th. The Soviet reply was sent by the Soviet Embassy in China to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th. The reply did not deny that Soviet aircraft fired shots, but stated that the unidentified aircraft had entered the airspace of the Lushun Port naval base, so the Soviet aircraft took off to force it to land. Because the aircraft did not obey the order to land, "warning shots were fired," but the aircraft was not the target. The reply stated that the Soviet side believes that this protest is groundless. After receiving the Soviet reply, our diplomatic authorities are currently studying countermeasures.</p>

President Zhang Qun specially ordered his subordinates on the 15th to pay attention to handling this matter.

<h3>Financial Officials Gather to Discuss Stabilizing the Currency Value, the Chairman's Proposal Will Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The issue of stabilizing the value of the legal tender has now become the focus of attention for financial officials. Chairman Chiang's proposal to the State Council on replenishing the legal tender fund and restoring the credit of the legal tender has been instructed by the National Government to the Executive Yuan to study and draft specific measures. At 10:00 AM on the 15th, Zhang Qun summoned Zhang Jia'ao, the Governor of the Central Bank, to discuss the matter for two hours. Zhang Jia'ao left at 12:00 PM. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, there was an important gathering at Zhang Jia'ao's private residence. Only Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, Xu Baiyuan, and Chen Guangfu participated. The discussion lasted for more than an hour. It is reported that the discussion was based on the Chairman's instructions, and a detailed discussion was conducted. If time permits, the case will be formally submitted at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 16th. It is learned that the Chairman's proposal is divided into two parts: one is to replenish the legal tender fund, allocate assets of more than 400 million US dollars, and hand them over to the Central Bank as a legal tender reserve fund, so that the value of the legal tender will no longer continue to fall and prices can be stabilized. The other is to restore the credit of the legal tender, and announce the amount of legal tender issued on a regular basis. In fact, the amount of legal tender issued is less than what is speculated outside, but because the figures have not been announced for a long time, it has caused a lot of speculation. The general public has some doubts about the credit of the legal tender. After the government replenishes the legal tender fund, the amount issued can be announced truthfully, so that the credit of the legal tender can be quickly restored and people's hearts can be stabilized.</p>

<h3>US House Foreign Affairs Committee Drafts Comprehensive Bill Including Economic and Military Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 15th (Broadcast): Washington News: The House Foreign Affairs Committee has begun drafting a comprehensive foreign aid bill, based on a blueprint by Republican leaders. They hope the bill can pass in the House by April 10th, allowing sufficient time to reach a compromise with the Senate and place the bill on President Truman's desk before the Italian elections on April 18th. The bill will include the European Recovery Program passed by the Senate, as well as economic aid to China and military aid to Greece and Turkey, with provisions for military aid to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Augusta, Maine, 15th] Republican Senator Robert Taft, during a presidential campaign speech here on the 15th, said that the spread of communism in China is as dangerous as in Western Europe. Communism also poses a threat to Korea and Japan. Secretary of State Marshall, while acknowledging the danger of the Chinese Communists occupying North China and the Northeast, opposes military aid to the Nanjing government, which is contradictory. If North China and the Northeast are occupied by the Chinese Communists, the US position in Korea will be precarious, and soon Japan may be forced to fall into communism. The shores of the Pacific will then be filled with communist forces, which may be more dangerous than the situation in Eastern Europe.</p>

<h3>A New Page in International Cultural Cooperation</h3>
<p>—From the UNESCO's Funding of Chinese Delegations to Eliminating Obstacles to Cultural Cooperation—</p>
<p>Recently, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) decided to use surplus funds from last year to grant six Chinese experts to study abroad. The Chinese Committee has nominated candidates, and their departure should not be far off. This is a meaningful new event in international cultural exchange work, and it may also provide a new hope for China's cultural education to further contribute to world peace.</p>
<p>UNESCO has only been in existence for a little over two years since its establishment in the UK in November 1945. Two conferences have already been held in Paris and Mexico. The meticulousness of the cultural charter's formulation, the large number of participating countries, and the broad scope of the undertaken projects can be said to have already achieved more than the "International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation" after World War I. It first launched basic education conferences for countries in the Far East, and it has given deep attention and assistance to China's cultural and educational sectors, which have suffered the most from the war. This passion and goodwill are truly what peace-loving Chinese people should be grateful for and cherish.</p>
<p>The six areas designated for this study tour are science and social development, audio-visual education, children's education, library science, educational administration, and art and music. I recall that one of the tasks set at the establishment of UNESCO was to "promote the free exchange of ideas among mankind through various educational organizations or methods (such as libraries, radio, exchange of teachers and students, etc.)". The aforementioned categories aim to assist China in fulfilling this task through these avenues. Therefore, although the scope of investigation and research varies, they should all have the common goal of promoting the exchange of ideas and cultural cooperation to contribute to world peace. Such a focused study, combined with the careful selection process, is clearly different from the general study or research abroad in the past. Its purpose is more serious, and its mission is even more significant.</p>
<p>From the long-term perspective of national and human culture, we are willing to place deep hope in the future trend of international cultural cooperation. For those who are sponsored by this international organization to study, we cannot help but expect them to achieve outstanding results. What we expect from them is, first, to have self-esteem and self-confidence. Although China is currently backward in science and its educational undertakings are underdeveloped, we must not be discouraged or belittle ourselves because of the current reality. We certainly have many things to learn from others. However, UNESCO's ideal is mutual assistance and cooperation, so we must not just unilaterally accept, but also emphasize fully exchanging opinions with people from other countries regarding general concepts and methods. China has an outstanding position in world culture and made great contributions and sacrifices to this World War, so we are confident that China should and will be able to make significant contributions to UNESCO's mission. The second is to have preparation and patience. Before departure, they must fully consider the specific issues that need attention. During the limited time of the study, they should carefully seek out information and make full use of it, striving to make a positive impact on the aforementioned various undertakings after returning to China.</p>
<p>Because of the general ignorance of European and American intellectuals about China, "many erroneous understandings and bizarre opinions have been formed". Therefore, a prerequisite for China's future international cultural cooperation is to have UN personnel more clearly understand the strengths and weaknesses of China's cultural traditions and the current general situation. This depends on our educators and specialists to speak out more abroad, and the study participants this time have an inescapable duty. The crux of China's current turmoil lies in the construction forces encountering destructive forces, the stabilizing forces frequently being disturbed, and good people being threatened and abused. China's cultural evolution is facing the most serious attack of new barbarism. Unless this violence is eradicated, China will not be able to contribute significantly to the great cause of cultural cooperation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the major premise of future world cultural cooperation is to guarantee international peace, and international peace must first have peace and progress within each country. However, today's world, although allied and looking at each other, maintains harmony on the surface, while international confrontation is forming and suspicions are deepening. Some economically and culturally backward countries in the East and West are filled with gunpowder and anxiety due to the Communist Party's constant disturbances, and education and culture are suffering severe damage. The goals set by UNESCO and the work it is striving for are precisely what the Communist Party wants to destroy. On the one hand, it seeks the development of science and society in various countries, while on the other hand, it destroys social stability and prosperity everywhere; on the one hand, it is enthusiastically planning the education of children after the war, while on the other hand, it is constantly creating (blank) and (blank) children and (blank) (blank). UNESCO wants to (blank) to various countries, (blank) books and cultural relics, stifle knowledge, and (blank), with (blank) and purposes, is to (blank) promote human cooperation and world peace through scientific, educational, and cultural cooperation; another international violence is destroying education and culture without (blank), destroying peace, in order to control mankind, and lead towards the end of culture.</p>
<p>China is an ancient civilization and is also an important (blank) in world peace today. Today's China is in a (blank) in which the people's livelihood is being threatened and culture (blank) is being devastated. With the rampant destruction of the Communist bandits' violence, China's education (blank) progress and cultural revival cannot be seen. With the existence of the Communist bandits, China cannot fulfill its mission for international educational and cultural cooperation.</p>
<p>The greatest enemy of China's cultural evolution is also the basic obstacle to world cultural cooperation. In the late Middle Ages in Europe, the destruction by (blank) was cursed as the enemy of civilization. Unexpectedly, in the evolution of culture to today, there is this new barbarism and new aggression being rampant, and it is the enemy of the UN's sacred cultural activities. Personnel from various countries participating in UNESCO should have a painful realization of this and develop effective international righteous public opinion and sanctions. Only in this way can the freedom of mankind from fear and lack be guaranteed, and only in this way can we fulfill our mission of guiding peace through culture, education, and science.</p>
<h3>Regarding This Year's Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>Whenever large quantities of agricultural products come on the market, various wholesalers find that their limited capital is insufficient for operation. Also, due to time constraints, they cannot afford to delay. Therefore, beforehand, they have to contact various associated firms and banks to secure funds for remittance. When the amount is large, exceeding what one or two firms or banks can handle, they often form a banking syndicate to jointly manage it. Cotton, wheat, silkworm cocoons, tea, etc. are examples of this.</p>
<p>After the war, due to various reasons, the production of various agricultural products has greatly decreased. However, the actual strength of merchants, who are nominally profitable but actually losing money, is also much less than before. The various firms and banks also have drastically reduced deposits and do not have large amounts of available funds to utilize. On the other hand, prices are surprisingly high, and the base prices are too high, so the need for working capital has greatly increased. Therefore, the financial responsibility that various firms and banks could previously shoulder has today inevitably shifted to national banks, as the only reliable backing.</p>
<p>The loan policy of national banks shifts with the country's economic policy. Whether or not to grant loans, the terms of the loan, and the target of the loan are not ultimately decided by the bank itself. At the same time, in order to (blank) the funds, and to turnover capital, they also have to request re-(blank) or re-(blank) from the central bank. Therefore, this type of funding for agricultural product purchases is in reality a (blank) government (blank) loan, and merchants requesting financing from banks are no different from seeking aid from the government. For this (blank) type of loan, it is often necessary to apply to the central government in advance. After approval, it is approved and handed over to a certain bank for handling, before all procedures can be carried out. This is an example.</p>
<p>However, the country's loan policy is not immutable. Sometimes it is looser, sometimes very strict, and sometimes it is directly rejected. Even during the periods when it is open, the focus and methods are often changing. If merchants cannot keep up, they can easily miss the opportunity. Therefore, in terms of procedures, they should strive to simplify and expedite the process.</p>
<p>Regarding the agricultural and land finance loan plan for the 37th year, totaling 15 trillion yuan, it was formally passed by the four-bank consortium on the 11th of this month. In addition to various other agricultural loans, tea loans amount to 80 billion yuan and sericulture loans amount to 150 billion yuan. Now that the specified amounts have been prepared for disbursement, it is expected that this year's tea and cocoon loans will not be delayed, unable to be processed, or hurriedly dealt with when things are critical. However, planning is one thing, and implementation is another. For example, when the loans are disbursed in the future, what method will be used? How will the interest rate be determined? Will the source of funds be entirely managed by the bank's own treasury? Regarding tea and cocoons, most are for export, but some are for domestic sales. Can this loan be uniformly included under the item of export trade enterprises? All these kinds of matters require supplementary adjustments or mutual consultations. In order to avoid the (blank) of handling too late, and to (blank) achieve the "greatest possible effect in accordance with the planned plans" as originally stipulated, we believe that all relevant parties should seize the opportunity and prepare quickly, in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. Everyone knows that agricultural loans should not only be a matter of facilitating merchants, but actually a matter of helping farmers, and not only a matter of helping farmers, but also a matter of maintaining production and increasing exports. If we really want to solve the current economic problems, then all the technical aspects of agricultural loans should not be taken lightly.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Beiping Municipal Assembly</h3>

No matter what battlefield victories are gained outside, if internal spies are not eliminated, the purpose of suppressing the rebellion cannot be achieved.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Bevin Formally Announces West Germany's Participation in European Recovery. Sixteen-Nation Conference Opened in Paris Yesterday. Spain Gains Support from Several Countries and May Also Participate.</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th (broadcast): Paris report, the Sixteen-Nation European Conference opened at 14:04 standard time today in the "Clock Room" of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Except for Switzerland and Iceland, all foreign ministers attended in person. British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced that Britain and France would jointly propose including the British, American, and French occupied zones of Germany in the European Recovery Program, believing this to be the only way to ensure the participation of the defeated countries in the European Recovery.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th] The Sixteen-Nation European Recovery Conference opened this afternoon in the Clock Room of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, chaired by French Foreign Minister Bidault. The first to arrive was British Foreign Secretary Bevin, followed by Italian Foreign Minister Sforza. After Bidault's welcoming speech, the chief representatives of each country spoke in succession. Bevin's important speech will be delivered at 4 pm this afternoon (midnight Shanghai time). Then, the sixteen nations' experts will meet at the luxurious Royal Monceau Hotel near the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 15th] It is expected here that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will deliver a historic declaration, outlining the new British continental policy. It is expected that Britain will, for the first time in history, express its willingness to ally with 270 million people in Western Europe to prevent the threat of communism. This alliance of sixteen European countries may grow into the United States of Europe, stretching from the Arctic in the north to the African continent in the south. However, this outcome depends on the new British foreign policy and the expression of widespread assistance from the United States. Subsequently, Britain and France will jointly take surprising actions, breaking away from their original policies, and propose granting Germany a voice in the committee working on the European aid plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived in Paris by train from London this morning. Staff from the British Embassy and French officials welcomed him at the station. Bevin went straight to the British Embassy to rest after getting off the train, and then went to the French Foreign Ministry to visit Bidault to discuss the details of West Germany's participation in the current conference. The principle of West Germany's participation in the conference was decided last night in a phone consultation between Paris, London, and Washington. Bevin is scheduled to leave Paris for Brussels tomorrow afternoon to sign the Five-Nation Western European Union Treaty on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 15th] The Portuguese government notified the British Foreign Office on the 15th that Portugal had decided to recommend to the Sixteen-Nation Conference that Spain be included among the countries participating in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th] People here are making various speculations about the gains of this conference. The news that the US Senate approved the European Recovery Plan has shattered the politically oppressive atmosphere in Europe since the Czech coup. Parisians are most interested in the hope of Spain and Germany participating in the Marshall Plan. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza told reporters on the express train to Paris, "We must recognize that the time for organizing Europe is now. I have come to Paris with full confidence, because recent developments have made our countries have to reach an agreement."</p>
<p>[United Press Frankfurt, 15th] British officials announced today that German representatives will participate in the Paris conference as economic experts, along with representatives from the British and American military governments, to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan. This is an initiative for German representatives to participate in international conferences after the war. The German representatives will depart for Paris within days.</p>
<h3>Western European Foreign Ministers Gather in Paris; Conference Agenda Divided into Four Major Items</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th] Representatives of Western European countries attending the Marshall Plan conference will all deliver major policy speeches. Most participating countries will be personally represented by their foreign ministers. Those who have already arrived in Paris include British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Oostehof, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Beck, Swedish Foreign Minister Unden, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, and Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris. The first two days of the conference will consist of three plenary sessions, held on the afternoon of the 15th, and the morning and afternoon of the 16th, giving the sixteen national leaders a total of about eight hours (excluding translation time) to deliver their policy speeches.</p>
<p>The conference agenda is divided into four main categories: (1) Accepting reports on the decisions, actions and achievements of the sixteen countries since the Economic Cooperation Conference held last summer regarding self-help plans. (2) Accepting (perhaps without discussion) the investigation reports of the US Government Special Committee, each of which is a "national" and "item" report. (3) Establishing a working committee to draft the charter of a permanent institution of the sixteen countries, and to draft a multilateral agreement stipulating continued economic cooperation among them. Discussing the method and scope for German participation in future meetings of the Economic Cooperation Committee.</p>
<p>The main tasks of the conference can be summarized as follows: In the political sphere, it will demonstrate that the countries outside the Soviet sphere of influence in Europe have decided to unite and work together to achieve political stability through planned economic recovery. In the economic sphere, it is currently the last opportunity before the US Congress reaches a decision on the European Recovery Plan to prepare a balance sheet of Europe's self-help plans and achievements, and to establish the necessary working institutions to handle US aid with the highest degree of efficiency.</p>
<p>The plenary session of the conference is expected to be completed within this week. The plenary sessions of the first two days will consist of policy speeches by the chief representatives of each country. The plenary sessions of the next two or three days will consist of discussions by senior representatives of each delegation, after which the working committee formed by the experts' committee will begin the detailed task of establishing a permanent institution. The task of the working committee will take approximately three to five weeks to complete, with the hope that it can be completed around the time the US Congress passes the European Recovery Plan, so that a third plenary session of the Sixteen-Nation Economic Cooperation Committee can be convened after the European Recovery Plan becomes law.</p>
<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Has Drafted Action Plan for European Recovery</h3>
<p>Prepared to Submit to Paris Conference</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th] An action plan for European recovery, jointly drafted by industrial and commercial leaders and experts from ten countries, will be submitted to the Sixteen-Nation Marshall Plan Conference today by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce, Keynes. The plan believes that any country has the moral right to request assistance only after it has fully and effectively utilized its existing resources and equipment. Temporarily reversing the trend of shortening working hours, and abolishing restrictions imposed by both labor and capital, can reduce the amount of assistance needed and help Europe become self-reliant. The plan also states that the most important responsibility of European governments is to prevent post-war inflation by balancing income and expenditure and not over-extracting national resources. State-owned enterprises should at least break even, and the number of civil servants should be reduced to serve productive enterprises. Income from assistance should not be used for unnecessary expenses, but should be used to combat inflationary trends, to achieve "deflation without tears." Participants in the International Chamber of Commerce's plan include experts from Britain, the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Taft Believes Situation Not Serious</h3>
<p>Does Not Agree with Byrnes's Remarks</p>
<p>[Reuters, Massachusetts, Quinton, 14th] Republican Senator Taft stated today that he could not agree with former Secretary of State Byrnes's statement yesterday that the United States would face a crisis with the Soviet Union within four to five weeks. He felt that until recently, the Soviet Union had only consolidated its position within the Soviet sphere of influence confirmed by the Yalta Agreement. As far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, the country was already under Soviet control before the Communist coup, and this event was merely a means of consolidating its position. He also said that the current world situation is still a war of influence, not a military war. If the Communist Party wins the general election in Italy, it is not a military action, and there is nothing the United States can do about it. The Marshall Plan will not produce results until at least six months later. Finally, he said that if the United States thinks that the actions of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia and Italy are a war, it is inevitably making trouble for itself.</p>
<h3>Marshall Testifies Before Senate Foreign Relations Committee Requesting Aid for Greece and Turkey; Italy's Inclination to Communism Will Result in Loss of US Aid</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th (broadcast): Washington report, Secretary of State Marshall, in order to support the new military aid of 275 million US dollars to Greece and Turkey, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today and stated that our country must avoid fear that would cause action to come to a standstill, and cannot act hastily, resulting in wasted resources. He said that due to the Communist Party's means of terror and fraud, the situation in Europe is more serious than it was a year ago.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th (broadcast): Washington report, the State Department stated frankly today. If the Italian Communist Party wins the election on April 18, Italy will no longer receive US aid.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 15th] Marshall may advise the US Congress within this week that steps other than the European Recovery Plan are needed to prevent Soviet expansion. In Marshall's plan to cope with what he calls the "extraordinarily serious" world crisis, increasing military strength may be included. Marshall will hold several closed-door meetings with Congress this week. The meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 15th was his first. Congress is now gradually increasing pressure, demanding that Marshall frankly explain the current world situation.</p>
<p>Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, demanded that the government explain the severity of the current threat of war. He said: "We want to know in detail how we will deal with this." It is believed that the government's plan to deal with the world crisis has not yet been formulated. It is still under discussion, and when this plan is formulated, Truman may issue a stern statement. This development would be tantamount to informing the Soviet Union that continued expansion to the West would be regarded as a threat to world peace and American security. Marshall will request support for his 275 million US dollar military aid proposal to Greece and Turkey at the Appropriations Committee today. When Marshall attends the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 16th, Chairman Gainey will ask Marshall about his needs and reasons. Many senators believe that the European Recovery Plan alone is not enough to stop communism in Europe. For months, Marshall has believed that the Recovery Plan is the best way to stop communism, but may eventually agree with the senators' opinions. The problem lies in how to prevent the indirect infiltration of the Communist Party. President Truman called on the United States to recognize that this "indirect action" against free people is a threat to the world and the United States. The most important situation currently is the situation in Italy.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Independence Anniversary</h3>
<p>Representatives from Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Other Countries Participate</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Budapest, 14th] The centenary of Hungarian independence will be celebrated with a grand ceremony tomorrow. Government delegations from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and private delegations from France, Italy, and Austria, were all received by the President today.</p>
<h3>Western European Defense Treaty May Expand in Scope; US to Be Asked to Guarantee Military Assistance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 14th] Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris issued a statement saying that he would study the possibility of concluding a treaty between Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Greece, and Turkey in Paris. The Turkish political community was greatly excited by this news, as this treaty had long been hoped for by Turkey. It is now believed that if this treaty is sponsored by the United States, it can be discussed outside of the Sixteen-Nation Conference in Paris.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 14th] Responsible diplomatic officials declared today: The five-nation treaty between Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg will be signed this Wednesday. The second step will be to seek a firm guarantee from the United States that it will send troops to help when necessary. The representatives of the five countries at the Brussels conference had already unanimously agreed that the US foreign policy, regardless of which party is in power, must now actively participate in the European situation, and what needs to be obtained thereafter is a formal guarantee of full-scale participation in the war immediately in the event of an emergency. If this guarantee can be clearly announced, it will be enough to deter any aggressor. If the United States takes this action, its current foreign policy must be greatly expanded.</p>
<h3>US Administration Plans to Request Congress to Take Military Measures Against Soviet Union; National Defense Conference of Army, Navy, and Air Force Has Adjourned</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] The US administration plans to request Congress to take military preparation measures to back up the US's strong statement to the Soviet Union. The gist of the statement is that any further Soviet aggression against Europe would be a dangerous move. According to senior sources: This motion is currently under active consideration by the US Cabinet and members of the Senate and House of Representatives. The purpose of this motion is to give the Soviet Union a clear warning, indicating that the United States considers future Communist expansion, especially the Communist Party seizing power in Italy, to be a threat to US security. However, well-informed sources insist that due to the broad and complex implications of this motion, it is currently under discussion and no decision has been made.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 14th] The Army announced on the night of the 14th that the conference convened by Secretary of Defense Forrestal and his chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Key West, Florida, had adjourned. Forrestal convened the weekend "countryside conference" to resolve broad disputes between the three services regarding the military strategic plans adopted in the national defense plan. He also stated that the conference would determine who would assume what tasks with what weapons, according to the Armed Forces Merger Act. Forrestal in Florida will now inspect several military bases in the state. A report on this conference may be issued after Forrestal returns here.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Treaty Negotiations to Begin on 22nd</h3>
<p>Stalin Notifies Finnish Government</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th (broadcast): Moscow report, Stalin has notified the Finnish government that the Soviet Union is prepared to begin negotiations with Finland on a mutual assistance treaty on March 22nd. The Finnish President had previously announced that the Finnish delegation could depart for Moscow at any time after March 20th.</p>
<h3>US Prime Minister Vigorously Condemns the Communists; 30,000 Women in Rome Hold Anti-War Demonstration; National Situation Tense as General Election Approaches</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Rome, 14th] Prime Minister De Gasperi today delivered an election campaign speech, vehemently denouncing the Communist Party. It is said that the Communist Party is plotting illegal actions in Italy. The Italian Communist Party has long been part of an international movement and cannot be cooperated with. The people once lost their freedom due to the dictatorship of the Italians, and should be careful not to lose it again in the future. The next time it will not be a dictatorship of the Italians, but a dictatorship from another country.</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 14th] Thirty thousand Italian women held an anti-war march in the streets of Rome today, shouting slogans such as "Down with the atomic bomb." They came from all over the country and were representatives of women's groups affiliated with the "Peace Tribunal" (the name of the Italian peace movement). Before the march, a conference was held, where several representatives, including Irene Curie, a famous scientist and daughter of radium discoverers Pierre and Marie Curie, delivered anti-war speeches, demanding universal disarmament and the destruction of atomic bombs. Afterwards, a delegation met with President Einaudi, presenting a "Peace Declaration" signed by two million women. The march dissolved in front of the Italian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 14th] According to a survey conducted on the 14th in five major Italian cities, it has been proven that wealthy Italian families are preparing to flee the country quickly if the Communist Party wins the Italian general election on April 18th. This survey, conducted in Turin, Milan, Genoa, Mima, and Naples, has proven that passport applications in Milan are thirteen times higher than usual, ten times higher in Rome, and slightly lower in other cities. Requests for new investment in industrial production and commercial activities have now completely ceased. In short, the upcoming Italian general election is a total duel between the Communist Party and non-Communist parties for control of Congress and the government. World opinion is also focused on this election, which may determine who controls the Mediterranean, the success or failure of the Marshall Plan, and the fate of the global Catholic center in Rome. Current opinion believes that the Communist front will gain 35% to 40% of the vote, and may even have 45% to 50% of the votes. Communist leader Togliatti gave two speeches in Turin, attacking the Marshall Plan's attempt to use Italy as a base for an anti-Soviet atomic war, and called for the left wing to win in the April election to "save peace."</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Requests Trade Agreement Negotiations with Italy</h3>
<p>To Proceed Simultaneously with Reparations Issues</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 14th, United Press] TASS Moscow reports that the Soviet Union has notified the Italian government, requesting reparations payments and proposing that negotiations on a treaty of commerce and navigation between the two countries proceed simultaneously. The Soviet note to Italy on March 9 stated that if an agreement on reparations is reached, then all economic and trade relations between the two countries can be determined. The Soviet Union also stated that the treaty of commerce and navigation between the two countries should be based on the principle of most-favored-nation status.</p>
<h3>The British Government Decides to Purge Extremists from Government Agencies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 15th Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee told the House of Commons that the British government will purge Communist Party members and similar elements from government agencies that handle national secrets and security secrets. This measure applies equally to fascists. These people can find employment in non-confidential agencies.</p>
<h3>Japan Requests Loans from the United States; Allied Headquarters Denies</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 15th] It is widely rumored here that the Japanese government has formally requested a loan of 1.6 billion US dollars from the United States to rebuild Japan. An Allied Headquarters spokesman officially denied this on the 15th. The secretary of the new Japanese prime minister stated that the new government had no knowledge of this request. However, United Press has learned that the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board has concluded, after studying Japan's needs over the next five years, that Japan's economy must have this amount of foreign exchange in order to achieve equilibrium.</p>
<h3>New Conservative Party Established in Japan; Formally Named the Liberal Democratic Party; Shigeru Yoshida Elected as Party President</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 15th] The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan announced its establishment on the 15th, which is the long-promoted new conservative party jointly organized by the Liberal Party and the Democratic Cooperative Club. At 2:00 p.m. on the 15th, it was held at Nagata-cho Elementary School in Tokyo. First, Yuetsujiro Uehara was elected as the temporary chairman to decide the party name as "Liberal Democratic Party." After that, the party constitution, declaration, and platform were discussed and unanimously approved. Shigeru Yoshida was elected as the president of the Liberal Democratic Party. Kijuro Shidehara was elected as honorary advisor.</p>
<p>In addition, the Liberal Party held its last party member congress at 1:40 p.m. on the same day, and the entire meeting unanimously resolved to dissolve the party. Six party members, including Seko, expressed opposition to the dissolution and were expelled. In addition, one member each from the Social Democratic and Democratic parties also joined the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 15th] The initiators of the new Japanese conservative party, the "Liberal Democratic Party," claim that the party will adopt a middle-of-the-road line. However, observers say that its policies are generally center-right. The party claims to have 151 seats in the House of Representatives, making it the largest party, followed by the Social Democratic Party with 122 seats, and the Democratic Party with 96 seats.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 15th] The main points of the Liberal Democratic Party's platform released on the 15th are as follows: (1) Politics: Implement open elections and revise the election law, strengthen local administration and educational and cultural administration; (2) Economy: Establish the relationship between the Japanese economy and the world economy, realize the free activities of enterprises, and make the tax system adapt to the burden of the people; (3) Labor: Strive to stabilize the lives of workers, etc. In addition, the Liberal Democratic Party is expected to be a true opposition party to the Ashida Cabinet in the future and will launch vigorous struggle activities.</p>
<h3>India's Own-Made Seagoing Vessel Holds Launching Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Reuters Visakhapatnam, Madras Province, 14th] India's first self-made 8,000-ton ocean freighter, the "Ushar," held its launching ceremony here today, presided over by Nehru himself, who used the throwing of a coconut fruit instead of the usual throwing of a champagne bottle. Indian monks also chanted scriptures at the scene. After throwing the fruit, Nehru pressed an electric button, and the ship slowly entered the water. In his speech, Nehru used a huge ship braving the wind and waves to symbolize a country traversing dangerous situations. He said that India had experienced many storms in the past and has not yet escaped the storms, and there will be many storms in the future, but India has shown the world that it is capable of dealing with any storm and is determined to face the storms.</p>
<h3>United States Approves Security Council Discussion of Czech Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 14th] It is rumored that the United States is prepared tonight to approve the United Nations Security Council's discussion of the Czech Communist coup. Well-informed sources claim that the United States' decision shows that the matter is serious enough to warrant the most serious crisis for the Security Council. The Soviet delegation is tight-lipped on the issue, but all representatives believe that the Soviet Union will do its best to oppose including the Czech issue on the Security Council's agenda. The first attempt at a vote will come on the 16th, when the Security Council will decide whether to include the Chilean proposal to investigate the Soviet Union's orchestration of the Czech coup on the agenda. The United States' attitude was decided after Chief Representative Austin consulted with the State Department. The veto power of the five major countries does not apply to the discussion of the agenda, so the Security Council will get seven votes. A majority can include the Czech issue on the agenda.</p>
<h3>Washington Holds Meeting to Commemorate Deceased Czech Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] A ceremony to commemorate the late Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk was held here today. President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and representatives of various countries attended. The recently resigned Czech Ambassador to the United States, Slavik, addressed the meeting, saying that Masaryk committed suicide in despair and frustration because he was in a tragic situation and could not help Benes. Several months ago, Masaryk was already troubled by the Communist aggression. Slavik later broadcast on the radio that President Benes had prepared two speeches during this coup, preparing to broadcast them, but they were prevented by the Communist Minister of the Interior Nosek. Slavik predicted that an anti-communist underground movement would be organized in the Czech Republic.</p>
<h3>US Miners Strike</h3>
<p>[United Press Pittsburgh, 15th] 25,000 to 30,000 coal miners went on strike here on the 15th in support of Lewis's demand for a monthly bonus of $100. Twelve mine shafts were forced to shut down.</p>
<h3>Four-Power Talks on Palestine Issue Fail; Arab Foreign Ministers Meet Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, 15th] The office of Austin, the US representative to the United Nations, announced that the four powers, China, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, discussed the situation in Palestine, but failed to formulate a common plan and will report to the Security Council when it meets today. It is said that China, the United States, and France agree to amend the UN General Assembly's partition resolution as another attempt to find a peaceful solution, but the Soviet Union insists that the UN General Assembly resolution cannot be changed and should be implemented as originally stipulated. Since an agreement was not reached, the four powers will submit individual reports to the Security Council. The issue of international troops was not specifically discussed in the four-power talks. The four powers will hold a final meeting at the Chinese delegation's office this afternoon to listen to the opinions of Nakleh, the representative of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee. Since the UN General Assembly passed the partition plan, this is the first time that the Palestinian Arabs have agreed to participate in the talks. It is expected that Nakleh will reiterate his refusal to participate in the discussion based on the partition plan and his determination to resist the partition by force.</p>
<p>[United Press Cairo, 14th] The Arab League announced tonight that the foreign ministers of the Arab countries will meet on the 16th in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, to discuss the Palestinian issue. At that time, a decision will be made on whether to accept the US proposal to send representatives to consult with the four major powers on a reconciliation plan.</p>
<h3>Former Annamese Prime Minister Writes to Bao Dai; Urges Cooperation with Ho Chi Minh; France Adopts a Policy of Division in Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Reuters Saigon, 15th] Former Annamese Emperor Prime Minister, Phung Quoc Huy, wrote a letter to Annamese Emperor Bao Dai, stating that attempts to cooperate with the French to resist the Viet Minh government will indefinitely prolong the Vietnamese resistance movement. Phung is currently in the Viet Minh-controlled area. He said that 99% of the military and political news released by the French regarding Vietnam is untrue. What the French have adopted is a policy of dividing Vietnam in order to carry out their dark plan of conquest. Phung said that the French have launched offensives in southern Tokyo for two years and in northern Tokyo for one year. Except for some major cities, the entire territory is under the control of the Viet Minh. Even in the cities occupied by the French army, most residents are still openly or secretly fighting for their country. 90% of the people have always supported the Viet Minh government. People have absolute trust in President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh government. This is because the Viet Minh prioritizes national interests. The Viet Minh army is sufficient to engage in a war of independence. We have seen our arsenals manufacturing weapons and ammunition day and night, and we have also seen French planes and warships shot down or sunk. In the French autumn offensive last year, the enemy deployed more than 10,000 troops from the army, navy, and air force in an attempt to eliminate the Viet Minh government and army. However, from October 7 to December 17, the French army lost more than 3,000 officers and soldiers, 11 ships, and 4 landing ships. At the beginning of the offensive, the French claimed to have occupied three-quarters of Tokyo. Now, the French army has withdrawn from the seven major cities of Tokyo. Phung's letter continued: I recently heard that Your Excellency intends to organize a government that opposes the Viet Minh regime. President Ho Chi Minh and the people of the Viet Minh know that Your Excellency is unwilling to be used by the French. Most Vietnamese will regard the government manufactured by France as the enemy's government. Your Excellency's reputation will be damaged, and the war of resistance in Vietnam will be prolonged indefinitely. The people in the country hope that Your Excellency will cooperate with President Ho Chi Minh to seek the independence and unity of the motherland.</p>
<h3>FAO Establishes Branch in Asia</h3>
<p>Location Still Under Dispute</p>
<p>[United Press Baguio, 15th] Representatives from nine countries met on the 15th to discuss the establishment of a branch of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to deal with Asian food issues. The meeting will last three days. US representative Vogel said, "We have accumulated hundreds of suggestions."

<h3>Songs Outside the District Court; Tongji University Student Unrest Case Opens Yesterday; Eleven Defendants Unanimously Deny Assaulting Mayor Wu; Request for Bail Denied, Ordered to Remain in Custody</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Students of National Tongji University previously opposed the school authorities' expulsion of a large number of students and opposed the student union rules promulgated by the Ministry of Education, causing unrest. Mayor Wu went to mediate and was allegedly insulted. The defendant students Huang Kelu, Pan Chengbang, Feng Liwen, Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, Xiong Zonglie, Wang Gongwei, Zhou Yongzhi, Sun Kezai, Qu Yuping and other eleven people were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for obstructing official duties and disturbing public order. The District Court Presiding Judge Hu Zhichao opened the Criminal Division 2 for a public trial at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Students from various universities, upon hearing the news, gathered more than 1,000 people and lined up at the entrance of the District Court, requesting to enter and listen in. The District Court issued more than 60 hearing passes yesterday, and those without passes were not allowed to enter. The iron gate was tightly closed, and the situation was tense. Deputy Police Chief Wang Yongchang and Pan Yuyi, along with 40 bailiffs, went to guard the premises. Lu Dagong, Chief of the Police Guard Division of the Police Department, also rushed to the scene with a large number of police officers. The students were still orderly. The presidium was temporarily set up on the upper floor of the Tongfang Teahouse across from the District Court. Amplifiers were placed, and orders were issued, singing and shouting slogans. The sound shook the universe. Fortunately, the District Court had taken precautions in advance, and the trial proceeded as usual.</p>
<p>The trial began at 9:00 a.m. The eleven defendants stood in the defendant's column. Prosecutor Huang Daping of the District Prosecutor's Office ascended the seat and stated the main points of the indictment, saying that the defendants were all young students who had violated the law due to temporary impulsiveness and had been prosecuted according to the law. However, considering that the defendants did not have general criminal malice, it was requested that they be treated leniently. Then, Presiding Judge Hu interrogated each of them individually. The eleven defendants, including Huang Kelu, unanimously denied assaulting Mayor Wu, claiming that the police cavalry charged in, and at that time, many students were surrounding Mayor Wu for negotiations. It was too late to dodge, causing some to fall, which caused Mayor Wu to be pushed down. Regarding who threw stones at the cavalry, they all claimed they did not see it.</p>
<h3>Huangpu Deputy Chief Testifies, Personally Saw Sun Kezai Make a Move</h3>
<p>Witness Zhu Yifu, Deputy Chief of the Huangpu Police Station, testified: "When Mayor Wu was talking to the students of Tongji University, I was standing next to Mayor Wu. At that time, I saw Sun Kezai, a student from St. John's University, aggressively jump over the ditch and spoke to the mayor in a very impolite manner. At this time, someone suddenly shouted to hit him, and Sun immediately moved to hit the mayor. Pan Chengbang hugged his waist from behind and tripped the mayor. I saw these two people with my own eyes. Wang Gongwei was not at the scene. I did not see clearly whether Qu Yuping made a move. I heard Feng Liwen shout, "Don't hit the mayor."" Then, witnesses Zhou Zhiyu, Shen Zuxuan, Liu Zhilu, Rong Lifang, Wu Hong, Lin Jiamei, Du Chengliang, and Ji Dabin were called to hear their testimonies. Temporarily, the defendants proposed witnesses Deng XianZhao, Fei Bingyin, and Cao Shishen, who gave their testimonies. The remaining witnesses, Tongji's Dean Jiang Hong, Mayor Wu's adjutant Zhang Jugong, Zhang Lianyun, Hu Liping, and others, did not arrive.</p>
<h3>Waving Flags and Presenting Flowers in Court; Defendants Forget Themselves and Applaud</h3>
<p>After the trial, all the defendants' lawyers stood up and requested the presiding judge to grant bail. Presiding Judge Hu denied the request, but said that he would try to conclude the trial and pronounce the sentence as soon as possible. The defendants were ordered to be returned to custody. Before Presiding Judge Hu left the court, two female students suddenly stood on top of the gallery and raised two red silk flags that had been hidden in advance, one with the words "Heroic Struggle, Strong Will" and the other with the words "Steel Is Forged That Way." Another female student held a bunch of flowers and presented them to the arrested students. The eleven defendants saw this and applauded enthusiastically. They were stopped by the bailiffs and returned to custody. After the defendants' lawyers left the court, the students in the gallery also presented them with a bunch of flowers and a white cloth square, with the words "The law is the purest, whoever pollutes it is our enemy" printed in red. The court was adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>The students outside the door, upon hearing that the trial inside the court had been completed, issued an order from the upper floor of the Tongfang Teahouse, four people in a row, to return to school in formation, shouting slogans along the way, and distributing leaflets "Our Accusations" before dispersing.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] In order to strengthen driving safety, facilitate vehicle dispatching, and improve driving efficiency, the Two Railway Bureaus decided to install CTC central control driving signals throughout the line. However, due to economic limitations, it is difficult to achieve in a short period of time. During this transition period, the railway bureau plans to install an additional "outer entry signal" at each station with particularly busy vehicle allocation and bay access, in addition to the original entry signal. The signal is one kilometer away from the station and cannot be controlled by the original single-line signal. The Works Department decided to use a double-line signal. This type of signal is used for the first time in domestic railways. Its advantages are that it can automatically adjust the line, is flexible, and is not affected by climate change. In particular, the control distance is long, and it has a safety device. If any accident causes the line to be interrupted, it can immediately show a dangerous image. The bureau has now selected the two ends of Wuxi Station for trial installation. These two new signals have been installed yesterday and are now in use.</p>
<h3>The Murderer in the Shandong Road Case Was Arrested Yesterday; He Suddenly Had the Intention to Kill After Failing to Borrow Money; He Was Finally Caught While Visiting His Mistress</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, a murder case for money occurred on the overpass of Chaozongfang on Shandong Road and Hankou Road. Fang Wu, the wife of a News Newspaper worker, was strangled to death. The previous report has been published. The murderer, Zhang Xiaoshan (21 years old) from Pudong, was arrested by the Huangpu Police Branch after two days of strict investigation, at 1:00 PM yesterday, in the Wanli Socks Factory at No. 22 Qing'anli, Tangjiawan Road. At that time, the criminal still tried to deny it, but after being taken to the bureau for interrogation and finding a paper for a pawnshop that was from the golden ring that was stolen from the dead Fang Wu, he confessed without hesitation. After the case occurred, Zhang Renyou, the director of the Huangpu Police Branch, ordered Li Yinmin, the head of the second unit, to solve the case within a time limit. Li personally led unit members Ren Fengwu, Gan Guiliang, Yang Weizhou, etc., to Pudong Nanshi and other places to investigate in the rain that night. They then learned that the murderer had a mistress named Wang Wenxian, also known as Li Guifang, who often worked in a sock factory near Xieqiao in Nanshi. They sent personnel to investigate, but the results were fruitless. However, they only knew that Wang often went to the Wanli Socks Factory to work temporarily, so they left police officers to wait. Until 1:00 PM yesterday, the murderer Zhang Xiaoshan went to the factory to visit his mistress and was arrested by the police officers who were waiting. According to Zhang, he originally intended to borrow a gold ring from Fang Wu, but was refused and insulted. He then took out a pre-prepared rope, put it around her neck. At that time, Fang Wu struggled hard, causing Zhang's cheeks to be covered with claw marks, which had not yet faded. After Zhang escaped, he took the gold ring to Lihe Pawnshop at No. 115 South Zhengzheng Road, pawned it for 4.5 million yuan in legal currency, bought a new set of clothes (the clothes he was wearing in the bureau), and rented Room 21 of the Gaosheng Hotel in Caojiadu. He only watched movies for entertainment every day. However, the good times did not last long. He only had 186,000 yuan left in legal currency, and he felt financially strapped. Therefore, he specifically visited Wang Wenxian yesterday afternoon, intending to borrow money from Wang to make a living, and was arrested.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Relief Association for the Shin Hsin Incident Visit the Families of the Dead, Injured, and Arrested Workers</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Workers in various industries in this city expressed their sympathy for the workers who died tragically in the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory incident. They formed the "Shanghai Trade Unions Relief Association for the Shin Hsin Incident." In addition to asking the authorities to severely punish the perpetrators who violated the law, they also requested that the innocent be released as soon as possible. The association sent representatives Xu Zhouliang, Wang Guorong, Shao Yuben, Yang Jingen, Le Xiuzhang, Zhang Rulin, Wan Baoying, Tan Zaixi, etc., to visit the families of the dead, injured, and detained. One of the three female workers who died tragically was Jiang Zhenxin, 17 years old, who lived at No. 8, Lane 454, Jianguo East Road. Each Zhuyunxian, 24 years old, lived at No. 216 Wuchang Road. Each of their families was sent a condolence money of 20 million yuan. Another female worker who died tragically was named Wang Mumei, 23 years old. Because her family was in Hangzhou, the condolence money of 20 million yuan was received on her behalf by her relative, Sun Jingwen, from the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory. The visiting representatives also went to Hongren Hospital to visit the two injured workers, each sending a condolence money of 2.5 million yuan and condolences such as milk, flowers, fruit, and biscuits. Each of the families of the 38 arrested workers was also sent 2.5 million yuan. For those without family members, the representatives went directly to the police station to visit the detainees and sent bread, Chinese cabbage, and other items.</p>
<p>Innocent Dismissals - Confirmed and Approved for Reinstatement</p>
<p>According to Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, he told reporters: After the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory incident occurred, various parties expressed their sympathy for the workers who died. However, a small number of people have ulterior motives and contain political effects, stirring up trouble everywhere, fabricating facts, which is not allowed by law. The government considers good-faith sympathy and relief to be reasonable, so the Social Affairs Bureau does not stop the "Shanghai Trade Unions Relief Association for the Shin Hsin Incident" from providing assistance to the distressed workers. After the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory incident occurred, 340 workers who were considered to have participated in the sabotage were dismissed. Among them, it is inevitable that there are innocent victims, so the Public Security Bureau is investigating from all aspects. So far, nearly 100 workers have been found to be innocent after interrogation and have been ordered by the factory to be reinstated.</p>

<h3>Observing the War Situation in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Xuzhou, 12th] Arriving in Xuzhou during the New Year, it is a relatively tense period militarily. The bandit troops in northern Jiangsu are stirring in various areas, and the National Army is also actively operating in areas such as Dangshan Huangkou and Donghai. At this time, the highest authorities personally came to Xuzhou on the 9th to inspect special forces and preside over important meetings, staying for three days. These objective situations make people somewhat tense. However, most of the residents here are accustomed to living in a wartime atmosphere. Some have experience with besieged city life, so they are naturally more firm and calm. Soldiers are everywhere on the streets of Xuzhou. Most of the important buildings are used by military agencies. The vehicles speeding by on the roads are not comfortable sedans but heavy military vehicles. Especially at major intersections, strong steel and concrete bunkers are built, which can be immediately turned into strongholds when necessary. Traffic is directed not by traffic police but by soldiers. On Zhongzheng Road in Xuzhou, there are several large buildings such as the telecommunications bureau, built by the Japanese during the enemy and puppet period. The construction is extremely solid. At that time, the Japanese prepared them as the final strongholds for street fighting in case of emergency. Last winter, when the bandit troops once approached Xuzhou, the artillery on Jiuli Mountain in the north began firing. The National Army authorities here also made preparations for emergencies. The surroundings of several large buildings were equipped with electric fences and communication trenches. Now, the threat to Xuzhou has long been lifted, but traces of the defense remain. Therefore, although military operations are taking place 200 li outside of Xuzhou, the city is still a wartime scene.</p>
<p>Bandit Troop Actions Are Evasive</p>
<p>The day after the reporters arrived in Xuzhou (the 11th) happened to be when the Chairman was stationed there, and the Army Headquarters was extremely busy. It was not until 3:00 PM yesterday, after the Chairman returned to Nanjing, that the headquarters resumed normal activities. Today, our group visited Guo Rugui, Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters. He previously served in the Ministry of National Defense and has only been working at the headquarters for a year, but his understanding of the enemy situation and his views on the suppression of the rebellion are exceptionally profound. He believes that the strength of the bandit troops is that their actions are evasive and unpredictable. The situation outside the customs is complex, and other factors besides military ones are involved, so he did not want to discuss it. Regarding the suppression of the rebellion within the customs, he believes that the most important thing is to not allow the communists to establish a base. Those that have already been established must be driven out, and then they must be pushed to the point of no return and finally eliminated.</p>
<p>Pursuit Methods Are Effective</p>
<p>This naturally includes a long-term, continuous pursuit process. This method has proven effective. For example, during the Shandong campaign last year, Chen Yi's Tenth Column was eventually forced to the dead end of the Yellow River Delta after being constantly pursued. More than 4,000 of them were eliminated in one fell swoop. This was the only true instance of annihilation. Because of the continuous pursuit, the bandit troops are bound to abandon a lot of equipment and will not be able to obtain replenishment afterwards. At the same time, the cadres of their troops, under extreme hardship, may defect and surrender. During the Battle of Central Shandong last year, many of the remnants of Chen Yi's First and Fourth Columns surrendered under the aforementioned difficult circumstances. Some bandit soldiers were probably coerced, ignorant people, and during the pursuit of the large army, they even hid in military vehicles on the Jinpu Railway. It was not until the train arrived in Jiangsu that they were discovered, and more than 100 people were captured! Guo believes that when the cadres of the bandit troops can no longer mentally endure the pursuit of the large army, that will be the time to achieve complete success in suppressing the rebellion. Secretary of State Marshall once said during the military mediation that "the communist army has hundreds of thousands of cadres who are willing to sacrifice for their cause, so they should not be underestimated." Now, many have already sacrificed, and there is a deep sense of a lack of capable cadres.</p>
<p>An Example from the Late Qing Dynasty of Suppressing the Nian Rebellion</p>
<p>To make it easier to understand, Guo compared the military situation to the suppression of the Nian rebellion during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty. He believes that the communist army's current strategy of looting and fleeing is quite similar to that of the Taiping Army and the Nian bandits in those days. The bandits are most afraid of natural obstacles, especially large rivers. Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, was very talented, but on the route of the Western Expedition, he was always restricted by the Yangtze River and finally failed at the Dadu River. When he first crossed Guizhou, he recruited 200,000 soldiers locally. When he left Yunnan, the crowd had grown to 500,000. This situation is very similar to the communist army's "join the army" method today. But these are all coerced, and they will collapse once they reach a dead end. Numbers are useless. When Zeng Guofan was suppressing the Nian rebellion, he also used rivers to shrink the activities of the Nian bandits. These historical lessons are still valuable for reference in today's military suppression. As for the combat power of the bandit troops, he does not estimate it too highly. He said: "Statistics show that in recent years, 80% of the losses suffered by the National Army in various places are due to the negligence of the generals, who do not carefully study the terrain through which they are marching. Therefore, they fall into the ambush of the bandits. The recent small setback in Yichuan is also this situation. The communist army within the customs is not qualified to attack fortified positions. Judging from the past records in Shandong, attacking fortified positions is when they suffer great defeats.</p>
<p>Using Civilian Labor Situation</p>
<p>One thing worth noting is that the bandit troops are currently supplying and expanding locally. Under this method, it is easier for their generals to develop their talents. For example, Chen Yi did not have a high reputation among the bandit army generals in the past, but in the group of three, when discussing the candidates for the commander of the two communist army corps, they nominated Peng Dehuai, which was natural, but instead of recommending Lin Biao or others, they nominated Chen Yi, which was quite surprising. And the basis for their nomination was focused on the replenishment and expansion of troops."</p>
<p>"The bandit troops now have no base and no supply organization. Not only do they take everything from the people for food, but they also use civilian labor entirely for carrying stretchers. Because their control is strict, the people cannot escape corvée labor. My personal estimate is that the civilian labor force in the bandit army is at least eight to ten times larger than that of the National Army. The people are really overwhelmed. Recently, the Shandong bandit army has even put forward the slogan of 'saving manpower,' which can also prove the extent to which the bandit army is harassing the people. Because they rely on local supplies for everything, they have many civilian cadres stationed to strengthen their control. This is also the main reason why the National Army often falls into ambushes when entering bandit areas.</p>
<p>How to Deal with Rural Cadres</p>
<p>The most effective way to deal with this group of "rural cadres" is to eliminate them, otherwise the bandit army cannot be eliminated for a day if the "rural cadres" exist. For example, the triangular area of Shanxian, Chengwu, and Dangshan counties and the old Kaocheng area of Henan are generally referred to as bandit areas. But the common people have never been bandits; it's just that the communist cadres control them strictly. In these two areas, tunnels are built everywhere and connected to each other, so they can repeatedly evade the National Army's offensives. In the future, the elimination of these areas will still depend on the continuous pursuit of the National Army, but establishing local armed forces is the fundamental solution. The correct use of local armed forces should not be for frontal offense and defense, but to eliminate the civilian cadres left behind by the bandit army."</p>
<p>The Possibility of Crossing the River</p>
<p>People from the Nanjing-Shanghai area are very concerned about the communist bandits' slogan of "crossing the Yangtze River in May." The reporter asked Chief of Staff Guo to make a judgment on the possibility of this happening. His views are very correct and worth special introduction. He said: "This is possible. In the future, cadres and small groups of bandit troops will definitely cross the river in succession and slowly establish their strength. Their current strategy is to make 'your cadres also my cadres,' that is, to create some 'double-faced Baojia chiefs,' using threats and inducements to turn the good people on the south bank into their tools. Before their strength is established, they will not have a large-scale crossing of the river, but when the local communists have considerable momentum, they will choose an inconspicuous location to sneak across. Although the Dabie Mountain area is currently controlled by the National Army, the local communists have not been completely eliminated and deserve close attention." How to mobilize civilian power and eliminate "rural cadres" is not a purely military issue, but a reform that needs to be combined with politics and economics. The reporter arrived in Xuzhou a few days ago and contacted various parties. I deeply feel that the military and political personnel here have a new understanding of "knowing the enemy and knowing yourself." This is what the environment has forged in the past two years. Based on this understanding, coupled with vigorous implementation, I believe it will surely bring a new look to the war situation. (Our reporter Ding Weidong)</p>
<h3>Military and Political Civil Servants in Northern Jiangsu Take on the Responsibility of Self-Governance and Self-Defense; Commander of the First Pacification District, Ben Mo'an, Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>[Report from Nantong, 13th] Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification District, recently announced two important measures in response to the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns of bandits ravaging northern Jiangsu and eyeing Dongtai: (1) Those affiliated with bandits who remain in our rear should be reported immediately. Once discovered, they will be treated as traitors; (2) The Baojia organization should be strengthened, household registration should be thoroughly investigated, and the system of joint responsibility should be enforced. At the same time, he also summoned military, political, and local leaders to deliver a speech, saying: "Everyone must accept the lessons of the past and raise their vigilance to appear in a combat posture. Military, political, and civil servants should especially take on the responsibility of self-governance and self-defense, lead the people, and fight against the bandits. Anyone who is perfunctory or fearful will be punished according to military law. I hope that local people will call on the masses to participate in practical work. The military and political authorities will give their full support. Wealthy merchants should also donate generously, and those found to be aiding the bandits for profit will be treated as one with the bandits. The education sector should work hard in their positions to create a good academic atmosphere, and the cultural sector should uphold justice and promote righteousness, so that we can work together to complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion."</p>
<h3>Fellow Pixian Natives Living Abroad Appeal for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] Pixian is the ancient site of "Xia Pi." Pi is the name of a river, with "Shang Pi" and "Xia Pi." Shang Pi is located in the southwest of Tengxian County and is also a lowland, while Xia Pi is the lowest of the lowlands. Currently, the water south of Mount Tai in Shandong Province all converges in Pi. The water in eastern Shandong flows from the Dayi River southward and enters the Grand Canal at Quewan in Pixian. The water in western Shandong flows southeastward through the Grand Canal, the Bulao River, and the Fangting River and joins in the "Three-Forked River" area of Pixian before flowing east. Therefore, every time the water rises during the rainy season, the Grand Canal cannot accommodate the large amount of water, and it inevitably overflows, causing disaster nine years out of ten. The autumn flood last year was the most severe. The entire territory has become a marsh. In addition, the communist bandits have rebelled, harassed, and destroyed. Food and grass have reached their end. The young and strong of the poor flee to beg for food, while the old and weak rely on tree bark and grass roots to survive at home, their skin yellow and thin, waiting for death. Although there are measures such as emergency relief and work relief, they are a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. The Pixian natives living abroad have organized a disaster relief association, with the general association located in Xuzhou. Branches have been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Beiping to seek assistance widely in order to provide universal relief.</p>

<h3>Taking off his Military Uniform to Start a Business, Weng Zhaoyuan Investigates Timber and Tea in Shenzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Fuzhou, 9th] Weng Zhaoyuan, the famous anti-Japanese general who once distinguished himself in the "Xifengkou" battles of January 28th, removed himself from military duties after the victory and retreated to the countryside, living in seclusion in the Shantou area of Guangdong Province, where he started a business. In the middle of last month, he flew from Shantou to Taiwan and traveled to various parts of Taiwan to inspect transportation, water conservancy, factories, and power departments, using them as a reference for starting a business in Guangdong Province. Along the way, he met with Chairman Wei of Taiwan Province, Vice Chairman Sun of the National Government, and others, and had a cordial conversation. On the 2nd of this month, he flew from Taiwan to Fuzhou with Yang Lianggong, the supervising commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, and stayed at the Zhongnan Hotel. That evening, the reporter called on him at the hotel. Weng was no longer wearing a military uniform and was dressed in casual Western clothing, and his overcoat was slightly wrinkled. His entire luggage consisted of only two thin quilts and a suitcase. He expressed his delight at the reporter's visit, but first denied that he would be taking on an important position in South China. He said that he had already decided to retire to serve his hometown and did not intend to get involved in politics and the military. In Shantou, he only manages a relief home and receives a small salary. Otherwise, he manages several farms, mines, and paper mills. He intends to expand his plans in the future. This trip to Taiwan was purely for investigation purposes, and his visit to Fujian was to investigate the production and sales of timber and tea in Fuzhou. He said that the Chao-Shan area of eastern Guangdong and the Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen areas of southern Fujian are awash with overseas Chinese capital and should be guided to useful purposes. If the government can provide more effective guarantees, the future is promising. Otherwise, if they are used for extravagance and waste, it will not only be a waste of wealth but also harm the customs and security of the overseas Chinese hometowns. Therefore, he plans to return to Shantou via Fujian and then go to Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia to collect some overseas Chinese capital for the needs of returning home for construction.</p>
<p>Weng is now sixty years old, but his spirit is unusually vibrant. He said that fighting is no longer possible, but he still has the energy to engage in business. When the reporter asked about the recent situation of General Cai Tingkai, he replied: They have lost contact with each other for a long time. He only knows that he is also engaged in business in Hong Kong. (Our reporter Huang Chuqing)</p>

<h3>A Cruel Mother-in-Law Kills Her Weak Daughter-in-Law by Strangulation with a Hemp Rope</h3>
<p>[Report from Wujin, 14th] A strange death case involving Chu Fengdi once caused a sensation in Nanjing and Shanghai, and the Changzhou Court was destroyed because of it. Unexpectedly, a year later, a similar case of a cruel mother-in-law abusing and killing her weak daughter-in-law occurred in Dongyao Village, Hekou Township, Qishu Yan District. It is truly a coincidence. Sheng Rong-sheng, a resident of Majia Village, Wugang Township, Old Fifth District, is a farmer by trade. He has a daughter named Mei-zhen. The farmer's daughter is quiet by nature, generous and poised, and has the demeanor of a lady from a good family. Several years ago, she married Lu Wen-yu, the Baochang of Dongyao Village, through a matchmaker. The relationship between the young couple was initially harmonious, but there was a mother-in-law and a sister-in-law in the family who were always instigating discord, spreading rumors, and frequently abusing her, resulting in disagreements and quarrels. The family has been troubled ever since. On the morning of the ninth of this month, the young couple quarreled again over some matter. Then, they began struggling with each other. After the neighbors persuaded them to stop, Mei-zhen's husband went to work in the fields after the quarrel. The cruel sister-in-law and fierce mother-in-law suddenly grabbed Mei-zhen and beat her mercilessly, until she was covered in bruises and begged for mercy before they finally spared her. When Mei-zhen's parents learned about this, they felt sorry for their daughter and rushed to the Lu family to take their daughter home to recover. At that time, Lu Wen-yu was in the city on business and did not know about this. When he returned home on the tenth and learned about it, he went to Majia Village in person on the afternoon of the eleventh to take Mei-zhen home. At that time, Mei-zhen insisted on not returning because she could not bear the abuse. After the repeated persuasion of relatives and neighbors, she reluctantly followed her father-in-law home in tears. After arriving home, Wen-yu went out again. Not long after he left, the cruel mother-in-law and fierce sister-in-law once again attacked Mei-zhen and strangled her to death with a hemp rope. After causing the trouble, the sister-in-law immediately fled without a trace, and the mother-in-law also hesitated and disappeared. When Mei-zhen's parents heard the news and rushed to visit, they saw Mei-zhen's body lying supine on the bed, and her death was extremely tragic, with rope marks visible on her neck. After negotiations, they finally placed the body on the bed. Lu Baochang relied on his power to prevent the matter from being expanded. Mei-zhen's parents were also poor and unable to report the matter to the city. The nearby locals were very indignant and were about to raise funds to help the deceased seek justice.</p>

<h3>A Headless Female Corpse; Two Maidservants in Kunming Murdered; The Master is Under Strong Suspicion</h3>
<p>[Report from Kunming, 15th] Strange cases have been occurring frequently in Kunming recently. Following the major bloodshed cases of a wife killing her husband, a son killing his father, and a brother killing his sister in the eastern suburbs, a bizarre double-corpse murder case has now occurred in the bustling Xiangyun Street, number 188. Sun Shouren, who recently purchased the land for the house, planned to hire workers to build a large building. While digging ditches and turning over the soil, two headless female corpses were suddenly discovered. After the police bureau was notified, they immediately launched an investigation and examined the corpses. It was determined that they were murdered before death. The former homeowner, Liu Huicang, and the Liu Rongguang couple who rented the house were summoned for questioning. It was learned that one of the female corpses was Xiaoguniang, 13 years old, and the other was Huanzhen, 11 years old, both from Guiyang. The Liu Rongguang couple purchased them last year to work as maidservants. On August 27th of last year, they returned home after watching a play, but there was no response when they called at the door. They broke down the door and entered, and saw the two maidservants lying on the floor, having apparently died from poisoning. At that time, the Liu Rongguang couple claimed that they were too panicked and feared causing trouble, so they hired workers to bury them in the room. The police bureau believed that their confession was evasive and there were too many doubts. Moreover, the Liu couple's behavior was improper and they both had addictions. There must be something hidden in the story. They are intensifying their investigation, and the truth will be revealed soon.</p>

<h3>Hubei Cotton Merchants Petitioning Group Demands the Signing of Cotton Purchase Contracts; Will Remain in Shanghai Long-Term Until Purpose is Achieved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hubei Cotton Merchants Petitioning Group, consisting of seven people including Cheng Ziju and Li Yingting, previously requested Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee in Shanghai to treat them equally, following the example of Shanghai cotton merchants, and requested the government to sign entrusted purchase contracts with Hubei cotton merchants, but to no avail. Therefore, on the 8th of this month, they went to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and specially hosted the city's press yesterday to explain that the motivation for the petition was not for their own business and interests, but to support the national policy of unified purchase. While in Nanjing, they voluntarily provided the Ministry of Economic Affairs with a draft of twelve articles on methods for entrusted purchase of cotton, which had four characteristics: (1) All working capital received is guaranteed by cotton of equal value, without using real estate or securities, and without depositing money or drafts. (2) An initial 300,000 dan will be purchased, with 150,000 dan delivered every 45 days. If the full amount is not delivered by the deadline, the cotton merchants are willing to be punished by the government for the shortfall. (3) If the working capital received or the cotton purchased is lost, the cotton merchants will bear all the responsibility themselves. (4) Purchases are limited to production areas, and there will be no competitive bidding or price increases. The Ministry of Economic Affairs forwarded these methods to the Yarn Control Committee for review and ordered the representatives to contact the Yarn Control Committee for handling. After the representatives returned to Shanghai, they contacted the Yarn Control Committee twice, but were unable to meet Chairman Yuan and were instead met by Deputy Director Wang Lan of the Production Committee. It is reported that Wang stated that the committee is drafting comprehensive cotton purchase regulations, so that anyone who complies with the regulations can request the government to entrust them with purchases. He also indicated two methods: (1) The Hubei cotton merchants should directly contact the Shanghai Cotton Merchants Association and transfer a portion of their established entrusted purchase quota to the Hubei cotton merchants. (2) The comprehensive purchase regulations will be released within three days. However, the representatives believed that the first point had technical difficulties and would be impossible to implement. At the same time, they still hoped that Chairman Yuan would provide a written reply to the Hubei cotton merchants' request. Before obtaining a definite solution, the representatives will remain in Shanghai for a long time and strive to the end.</p>

<h3>The Atomic Energy Problem and Everyone's Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Original by Li Lian Tai Er, Translated by Chen Zhuo Ru</p>
<p>It is a fallacious and entrenched opinion to believe that the atomic energy problem is irrelevant to the general public. Some people say that the problem is too specialized and that laymen cannot understand it; others say that the problem is related to national defense and is dangerous to discuss. Still others say that the problem is simply a mental exercise that is of no practical use, and therefore advocate ignoring it. Furthermore, they argue, since this method of silence was very successful during the war, why should we change course today?</p>
<p>But I believe that this is not correct and that it is dangerous to the ideals cherished by the Chinese people, and therefore harmful to national security.</p>
<p>Atomic energy has not changed the fundamental principles of democracy—which are based on the belief in the wisdom of the people, as long as everyone knows the main facts. This principle and this belief are the legal basis for the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission. If the people want this principle and policy to be effective—that is, if the people themselves want to decide the policies that determine their own future destiny—then this policy must be able to be implemented. The glory of democracy lies in the fact that the common sense judgment of the entire people can determine the course of the nation. Therefore, atomic energy is everyone's business.</p>
<p>What do you think of when you talk about atomic energy? Nine times out of ten, you only think of the atomic bomb. This is natural. This atomic weapon is a reality. I live with it day and night, and although this is unbelievable, it is actually the case. Simply frightening people and making them anxious day and night, suffering from neurosis—this is also not a solution and will ultimately be of no help.</p>
<p>It is a fact that atomic energy produces a weapon of unimaginable destruction. The Atomic Energy Commission is still designing, developing, and manufacturing such a weapon, and we are determined to maintain America's superiority in this area until effective international management can be implemented. This is the basic policy of the Atomic Energy Act passed in 1946—the McMahon Act.</p>
<p>At present, our monopoly on the manufacture of such weapons will not last forever; other countries will also be able to manufacture atomic bombs. Once a war with a large number of atomic bombs occurs, civilization will undoubtedly suffer a great disaster. This is why, in the United Nations, various countries are trying and continue to try to put atomic weapons under effective international control—but these efforts have not yet been successful.</p>
<p>No one—least of all I—underestimates the importance of atomic energy as a weapon. It has fundamentally shaken past political and diplomatic views. These facts are important to every citizen who lives in peace and prosperity, whether he lives in Washington, London, Moscow, or Paris.</p>
<p>But equally important is that atomic energy and the atomic bomb are not synonymous. If the public continues to think so confusedly, it will be difficult to prevent atomic energy from being used as a weapon, and it will be even more difficult for us to obtain the benefits of this great invention.</p>
<p>The atomic bomb is only the first performance of atomic energy, and although these performances are very dramatic, in fact, what we have obtained is not just a weapon. We have also gained a new knowledge of a very great and very universal force, comparable to gravity and electromagnetism.</p>
<p>I believe that no physical thing is more important to human well-being than the sun. We get all our power from the sun—chemical power, the power to create and sustain life, the power to build skyscrapers and temples, and the power to write poems and songs. The light of the sun is the very stuff of life itself.</p>
<p>This seems like a platitude, but it is very relevant to the problem of atomic energy, because the sun, the source of life, is also a huge atomic energy factory. The power emitted by the sun comes from a very common element in the sun.</p>
<p>So the power hidden in the atom is not a rare thing, not new at all. What is new is that today, in our generation, knowledge has increased to such an extent that we are finally close to understanding atomic energy and are about to make it available for human use.</p>
<p>Atomic power is not fully understood even by the greatest scientists today. But there are two very important facts that everyone alive should know.</p>
<p>(1) Humanity knows more about atomic energy in the past thirty years than it did in the previous thousands of years.</p>
<p>(2) In a few more years—perhaps ten years—we will be able to answer so many mysteries of life and matter that it will give us a new concept of life.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to be born in this fragment of history, because the basic knowledge of life is about to be understood by mankind.</p>
<p>New knowledge naturally brings about change. Atomic weapons have changed the relationship between countries, and the problem of how to maintain peace has also changed. Atomic energy has changed the way we treat diseases. At present, radioactive materials—isotopes—are adding to our methods of treating cancer, heart disease, and other diseases (Translator's note: For example, radioactive iodine compounds are used to treat cancer of the thyroid gland, because the thyroid gland absorbs iodine, and the cancer in that area is exposed to radiation, which cures the patient).</p>
<p>These radioactive isotopes, like the first atomic bomb, are produced in large quantities in the same important experimental factory, in the same atomic reactor. The material that is put into the reactor becomes radioactive when it comes out of the reactor, and is similar to radium in some ways, but differs in its quantity and variety.</p>
<p>These radioactive isotopes are now used in medicine. At Vanderbilt University, a certain type of chronic anemia (leukemia) is treated with gold that has been irradiated in the atomic reactor that was originally used for national defense. Memorial Cancer Hospital in New York and other institutions also use radioactive isotopes to treat certain special types of cancer.</p>
<p>It is too early to say that these treatments have some kind of miraculous effect. But in medical and biological research, there is a great deal of well-founded hope in this area in the future. The knowledge gained from this method of the internal workings of the human body and the general biological processes, and the influence of external objects or diseases on the organic tissues of the human body or animals, is all just beginning. This new knowledge will fundamentally affect our future.</p>
<p>The radioactive materials produced at the Oak Ridge atomic energy plant of the Department of Defense are now giving us some clues to the age-old mysteries of life. For example, how does a cornstalk use sunlight to produce food that provides energy? How does a plant absorb fertilizer from the soil, and what kind of process is actually taking place in the plant?</p>
<p>The prospects for new knowledge in agriculture are virtually endless. No area of research holds more hope for human understanding of the basic secrets of nature than the radioactive carbon research currently underway—that is, the secret of photosynthesis. People have never known how plants use carbon dioxide and water to form carbohydrates. There is a mystery here.</p>
<p>(Translator's note: Extremely small amounts of radioactive atoms constitute ordinary compounds, which are ingested by organisms. Because of the presence of radioactivity, we can use a Geiger counter to measure the process of these substances, and thus we can see the entire process of these substances in the organism. This use of radioactive materials is being applied in many ways.)</p>
<p>Some answers may not be so fundamental, but they are still generally hoped for, such as: how to prevent insect pests, protect fruits with insecticides, determine how plants actually use fertilizers, and some related questions, which are all solved by using radioactive isotopes. These issues can greatly affect the world's food supply, and are therefore an important step towards world peace.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the entire cost of research on atomic energy—which has cost $250 billion to date—can be compensated for and more than compensated for by the benefits it has brought in agriculture and human nutrition.</p>
<p>This radiation process will have many uses in the future. Ordinary and little-known atoms, after being struck, will open up new worlds in industry. We are now using radioactive steel to study why anti-friction bearings wear out, because we can use radioactive steel to measure the specks of metal that fall off the friction surfaces, as small as one ten-millionth of an ounce. The steelmaking industry can also control the process of sulfur exchange between iron and slag in the steelmaking furnace with great precision, because we are now using radioactive iron and sulfur tracer research.</p>
<p>At the University of Wisconsin, they are using radioactive isotopes produced in the Oak Ridge chain reaction machine to study the surface phenomena of glass and metal. Scientists are beginning to realize that there is a thin, insignificant layer of foreign molecules and ions deposited on the surface of glass and metal. This knowledge enables us to know how to make better mirrors, improve electroplating, and may have great developments for the manufacture of detergents.</p>
<p>Radioactive isotopes are produced in the nuclear reactor, which ordinary people call a pile. (The so-called pile is made of a large pile of graphite—used for pencils—and a layer of uranium. (This pile, from the outside, looks like a warehouse without windows. Inside, if the reaction is taking place, the extremely strong radiation is like several tons of radium radiating. (But in the entire United States, there are only about twenty-five ounces of uranium available). This spontaneous nuclear chain reaction machine does three things here:</p>
<p>(1) It produces plutonium, a new element that can be used for other reactors or weapons.</p>
<p>(2) It produces heat, which one day can be used for motive power.</p>
<p>(3) It produces neutron radiation, an invisible and extremely fast-moving molecule. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Religious Disputes in India</h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>Gandhi's death was due to political reasons, but also to religious reasons. The political struggle in India is essentially a religious struggle. In the history of religious struggles, there have been countless bloody events. If Gandhi's death is seen as the death of a martyr, it still cannot express Gandhi's greatness. Gandhi's greatness lies in his ability to go beyond religious disputes and seek to resolve them.</p>
<p>However, Gandhi ultimately failed to resolve the religious disputes in India. What is the reason for this? This is what the author wants to briefly explain here. From a historical point of view, religious disputes are a type of dispute that cannot be resolved. The reasons why they cannot be resolved are twofold: first, the nature of religion in general, and second, the characteristics of religion in India. By briefly explaining these two points, we can have a clearer understanding of religious disputes in India.</p>
<p>Religion is based on emotion, and its goal is to seek comfort for human emotions. The reason why humans need religion, or the reason why religion arises, is because human emotions are uneasy, especially when it comes to matters of life and death, they feel confused. Because of this unease, humans have a need for religion. In a state of everything going well, and the will and emotions being pleased, religion seems unnecessary. When humans need religion, there must be a problem with their emotions. Therefore, they either do not believe in religion, or if they do believe, their emotions are particularly strong. All the rituals of religion are mostly designed to arouse human emotions, and its doctrines are mostly designed to satisfy human emotions. Ordinary emotions tend to arise and disappear quickly, lacking continuity, but religious emotions are often continuous and not easily disappear. At the same time, religious emotions are also stronger than any other emotion. Therefore, the struggle between religions is a struggle between emotions. This kind of struggle is often not something that reason can resolve. This is because only reason can obey reason, but emotions are not easy to obey reason. This kind of struggle is also often not something that another emotion can resolve. Emotions may obey the same emotion, but they are not easy to obey different emotions. This can be said to be one reason why Gandhi was unable to resolve the religious disputes in India.</p>
<p>Secondly, the religious disputes in India are disputes between Islam and Hinduism and Buddhism. According to Northrop, human religions can be divided into two major categories: one category is theistic religions, and the other category is non-theistic religions. Christianity, Islam, etc. belong to the former category, while Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism belong to the latter category. The former category of religions, that is, theistic religions, are characterized by: all being aggressive, all having a missionary zeal, and all regarding other religions as heretical, wrong, and inferior. They all regard their doctrines as absolutely perfect, and their followers are divinely mandated to replace other religions with the "only perfect religion." Therefore, this type of religion is narrow-minded, intolerant, and extremely difficult to cooperate with other religions. Conversely, the latter category of religions, that is, non-theistic religions, do not have aggressiveness, lack missionary zeal, and are more able to respect other religions. This type of religion is open-minded, broad-minded, and easier to cooperate with other religions. The fact that Buddhism and Christianity did not cause serious disputes when they came to China is because China's own religions are non-theistic. However, the religions of India itself, such as Islam, are theistic, and their followers have a considerable number and a considerable strength, so it is extremely difficult to get them to cooperate with India and other religions. In this way, the partition of India and Pakistan was inevitable, and Gandhi's failure was also inevitable.</p>
<h3>The Union of Aesthetic Objects and Emotions</h3>
<p>— Han Yuwen</p>
<p>Aesthetic emotion is emotion towards an object, and at the same time, an aesthetic object is the concrete expression of aesthetic emotion. Therefore, aesthetic emotion and aesthetic objects have a unified relationship.</p>
<p>According to common sense, emotion is subjective and the object is objective, so how can the two be united? Some people think that the emotions of the aesthete arise from changes in the muscles of the aesthete, and that the emotion in the object is transferred from the emotion of the aesthete to the object. For example, Vernon Lee said, when you see a mountain on the horizon, you feel that the mountain is rising from the ground. This concept of rising is full of associations of life, energy, and courage. So when you see that mountain, you have emotion for it and think it has a certain character. The reason why you think this way is because when you look up at that high mountain, you have a rising emotion due to your looking up and other muscle movements, so you unconsciously use this emotion and the meaning you imagine in this situation to describe that mountain, so you feel that the mountain has emotion. This is the case for mountains and other objects as well. When you quietly observe an object, especially when you quietly observe a system of lines and patterns, you always have corresponding tension or movement in your body for the form of that object: rising or falling, advancing or intersecting, or obstructing each other. These situations are the materials you use to construct your object and its emotions.</p>
<p>Vernon Lee also has a similar example. He said, here is an ordinary ceramic vase. When you see it, you have a special overall feeling for it. First, your feet are on the ground and your eyes are fixed on the bottom of the vase. Then you pick up the vase, while straightening your body, and the symmetrical sides of the vase make both your left and right lungs move together with them. As your eyes move from the bottom of the vase along the curve of the vase's outline to the mouth of the vase, you will have to inhale into your stomach. This situation is as if we were going to make a vase ourselves in order to immerse ourselves in it and unite with it.</p>
<p>This explanation of the union of emotion and object is indeed very vivid and moving, but Bosanquet believes that, first, this theory places too much emphasis on the status of lines and patterns. Although patterns are a preliminary symbol for us to recognize forms, it is a big misunderstanding to think that spatial patterns are aesthetic forms. What's more, lines and patterns are no more able to express aesthetic forms than colors and tones. The depth and contrast of colors and the harmony of tones are just as much aesthetic forms as the patterns in space and the rhythm in time; the latter is no more superior to the former. Second, the tension and movement in our bodies caused by lines and patterns are not the same for everyone. And our actual imagination or perception does not need the help of these details. In fact, these details hinder our imagination and perception.</p>
<p>Mitchell also has an example. He said that when we enjoy an elegant curve, our eyes move along that curve. Our pleasure is felt in this movement of the eyes, and at the same time we transfer our pleasure to the nature of our object in this situation. But Bosanquet believes that things are not that simple. When we appreciate a curve, our eyes do move along that curve, but the muscles of the eyes are only a sensory moving machine, and that curve is not only a sensory object, but also a perceptual object; the character that our imagination gives to that curve undoubtedly comes from our entire experience, and we have no reason to say that it comes from the movement of the eyes. In order for our pleasant emotion to become a characteristic of the object, we must of course live in the details of that object, but to reach this point, we must have a complete imagination. That is to say, the union of emotion and object is the result of the entire aesthetic imagination, not the result of muscle activity. The emotion in the object certainly has its subjectivity, but it also has its objectivity. In fact, we see interest in the object in the same way that we see colors and patterns in the object and hear sounds in the same way. Therefore, how we attribute emotion to the object is the same as how we attribute colors, sounds, and patterns to the object, and there is no need for two different theories to explain.</p>
<h3>On Learning and Skill</h3>
<p>— Shao Xiong</p>
<p>The meaning of the two words "learning" and "skill" indicates a major truth, that is, equal emphasis on theory and practice, or equal emphasis on knowledge and action. "Learning" is to clarify the principles, which is a matter of theory, that is, a matter of knowledge. "Skill" is to realize the principles, or apply the principles, which is a matter of practice, that is, a matter of action. It is not acceptable to have learning without skill, and it is even more unacceptable to have skill without learning. Learning and skill cannot be separated; separation will lead to mutual harm and nothing will be accomplished.</p>
<p>The difference between Chinese and Western cultures can be seen from the separation or non-separation of learning and skill. Generally speaking, Western culture is a culture that does not separate learning and skill, and places equal emphasis on learning and skill. The Greeks had brilliant achievements in the area of learning. The Greeks emphasized investigating principles and seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge, so they created many intellectual systems in the theoretical aspect. The contributions of the Greeks cannot be ignored for the Western culture of today. However, the contributions of the Greeks seem to be limited to learning and have not yet reached the level of skill. The Greeks did not fully link learning and skill. Their learning still relied on speculation and lacked experimentation, and as a result, their learning was limited and could not make long-term progress. Therefore, although the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle controlled the entire Middle Ages, the Middle Ages still made very few contributions in the area of learning. It was not until the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution that Westerners realized the connection between learning and skill, and realized that they should closely link learning and skill. On the one hand, they emphasized learning, emphasizing the exploration of pure theory; on the other hand, they also emphasized skill, emphasizing practical application. When there were new discoveries in the theoretical aspect, there were immediately new applications in the practical aspect. Learning inspires skill, enabling skill to gain new ways of application from the inspiration of theory. Skill verifies or negates learning, enabling learning to gain ways of progress from the success or difficulty in practice. Therefore, if there is skill without learning, skill will be limited to a mere craft and cannot have new discoveries. If there is learning without skill, learning will be limited to empty theory and cannot have new progress. To promote the common progress of learning and skill, skill must be supplemented by learning, and learning must also be supplemented by skill. The main secret of the progress of Western culture in the past century lies in this.</p>
<p>Conversely, the main reason why Chinese culture has stagnated and cannot progress is because Chinese culture is a culture in which learning and skill are separated. On the one hand, Chinese culture seems to emphasize learning, and on the other hand, it seems to emphasize skill. It is naturally not very accurate to say that Chinese culture emphasizes learning. But it is also not very accurate to say that Chinese culture emphasizes skill. In fact, Chinese culture has learning, but learning cannot be supplemented by skill, and it has skill, but skill cannot be supplemented by learning. People who talk about learning still engage in empty talk, emphasizing speculation, and their speculation is like a horse without reins, uncontrolled by methods, unconstrained by facts, and as a result, they are mostly mired in fantasy. Therefore, even in the area of learning, China cannot surpass the West. This is the drawback of having learning without skill. In the area of skill, China has indeed made amazing contributions in the past. For example, the three major inventions of the compass, gunpowder, and printing are things that the Chinese can be proud of. However, they stopped there, and now the progress of these inventions is in the West and not in China. The reason is that Chinese skill is mostly not supplemented by learning. Although there is such and such a skill, there is no such and such a learning. Skill does not advance to learning, so skill is stagnant and never progresses. This is the drawback of having skill without learning. Therefore, Chinese culture has become a culture that either has learning without skill, or has skill without learning, and learning and skill are always separated. When learning and skill are separated, learning does not progress, and skill also stops at what it already has.</p>
<p>From this, one way out for Chinese culture is to closely link learning and skill. We cannot emphasize learning without emphasizing skill, and even more so, we cannot emphasize skill without emphasizing learning. Only when learning and skill are united can we produce true "learning and skill."</p>
<h3>Scholarly Jottings (Thirteen)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Contemporary European and American Thought (Part 1)</p>
<p>Professor R. M. Roxby of England once stated that the Three Principles of the People is a synthesis of Eastern and Western thought, integrating China's inherent traditions with the thoughts and experiences of Europe and America from the 19th to the early 20th centuries. This is a very fair observation. To fully understand the Three Principles of the People, we should consider the entire world of scholarship and culture as its background. This article, based on Bertrand Russell's new book, "A History of Western Philosophy" (published in October 1944), categorizes modern European and American thought into eight major schools, providing a brief introduction as a reference for comparison. This may lead to a deeper understanding of the ideals of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>(1) Liberalism: Liberalism and the British Empiricist school share a common origin. John Locke (1632-1704) was the pioneer of Empiricism in epistemology and the forerunner of Liberalism in political philosophy. Anyone in modern Western society who discusses democratic politics invariably admires Locke. His theories laid the foundation for British democracy and sparked the American and French Revolutions, with profound and far-reaching influence. Locke's method of thinking was experimental and tentative, accumulating knowledge bit by bit, like scientific work. He believed that politics should be governed by reason, emphasizing evidence and discussion, not respecting authority, not being dogmatic, and believing in gradual reform. The English Revolution of 1688 (the 27th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty) was the most moderate and successful revolution, largely due to Locke's advocacy. In his book "Two Treatises of Government" (published in two volumes in 1689 and 1690), he fully elaborated on the spirit of the English Revolution. It attacked the monarchy,贬斥hereditary power, advocated freedom of speech, and holds an extremely important position in political thought. During the period of civil strife in England, the conflict between the royal family and the parliament was evenly matched, fostering a mentality of reconciliation and compromise, avoiding extremes. This national character has persisted to this day. Locke believed that to change another person's beliefs, one must patiently persuade and gently guide, not immediately denounce others as stubborn or even oppress them. Anyone with a humble desire to learn will not want to force others to agree with them. He also said that in believing in truth, we cannot help but have some skepticism. This sentiment is related to religious tolerance and is the essence of British parliamentary politics. The liberal approach laid the foundation for long-term peace and stability in Britain. The principle of separation of powers and checks and balances created by Locke in "Two Treatises of Government" is the mainstream of modern democratic thought, especially in the United States, where it has been most fully implemented. The American president, Congress, and Supreme Court have established the dignity of the separation of powers. When conflicts arise between the powers of the president and Congress, Locke's theories are often adopted as a guideline. There has only been one instance of armed conflict in American history. Russell is most enthusiastic about Locke's theories, believing that to hope for world peace, totalitarian thinking must be abandoned. If a world government is established in the future, the system of separation of powers can still be applied. However, Liberalism is not without flaws. The early liberals, represented by English Protestants, were rich in common people's colors, but the concept of property often occupied an important position. Locke's theory of democracy was based on private property. The English Revolution of 1688 was originally a triangular relationship between the British aristocracy and the middle class (great merchants and wealthy businessmen) united against the monarch. After Locke, liberals represented the emerging industrial and commercial sectors in England. They opposed the monarch and the aristocracy, but not landlords and capitalists, so Liberalism had a relationship with capitalism. Russell criticized capitalism, saying: "Political power cannot be hereditary, so why can economic power be hereditary? The principle of inheritance has been abolished in the political sphere, but it is still regarded as natural in the economic sphere. Political dynasties have passed, but economic dynasties still exist." This is an extremely insightful argument, pointing out the shortcomings of Liberalism.</p>
<p>(2) Romanticism: Romanticism opposes Liberalism. The theories of the Frenchman Rousseau (1712-1778) appealed to emotions, directly addressing people's hearts, and were the pioneers of the Romantic movement. This school disliked early industrial civilization, containing anti-scientific and anti-rational colors. The Englishman Byron (1788-1824) was a romantic poet, and Carlyle (1795-1881) advocated the worship of heroes. Due to the promotion of writing, its momentum gradually increased. In the early 19th century, Germany was not yet unified. German historiography, centered on Prussia, advocated nationalism. Fichte (1762-1814) and Hegel (1770-1831) sang praises to the national soul and were spokespersons for Prussia. Bismarck completed the great cause of German unification. When nationalism becomes extreme, it becomes national supremacy, which is ideologically in tune with hero worship. As for the establishment of the academic foundation of Romanticism, it relies on the Germans Schopenhauer (1762-1814) and Nietzsche (1844-1900). This school of philosophy emphasizes will, worships power, is emotionally impulsive, and reaches a state of fanaticism. It is also influenced by Darwin's theory, advocating unrestricted competition, regarding war as heroic, and considering the idea of peace as unworthy of respect. From the second half of the 18th century to the present, literature, art, philosophy, and even politics have directly accepted the influence of the Romantic movement. Its momentum is unstoppable. The ultimate problem is Nazism and Fascism, which advocate totalitarian politics domestically and an aggressive policy externally. Because the Romantic school regards national interests as the highest law, dictators can use it to attach themselves to representing public opinion. The Romantic school entrusts power to a few individuals in a few ethnic groups, not hesitating to use violence to achieve this goal. Therefore, all power struggles and hegemony, and aggressive wars are inevitable. The biggest difference between Romanticism and Liberalism is its emphasis on emotion and tendency towards extremes. Russell believes that emotions are superficial and easily aroused, while reason is profound and difficult to achieve. Emotions are independent, while reason must be shared with others. Emotions only care about the present, while reason must consider the future. Humans cannot live in isolation from the world. If they want to be good to others, they cannot focus solely on emotions. Rousseau is the father of the Romantic movement. From today's perspective, Rousseau's theory seems to advocate democracy, but in reality, it is often enough to support totalitarian states. Russell particularly criticized Nietzsche and his ilk, saying that in Nietzsche's view, Lincoln was humble and Napoleon was great. In their minds, there is only universal hatred and fear, without universal sympathy and love. They only think about pain, wanting to put others to death, despising the virtue of benevolence, and not believing in this real world that is the foundation. Nietzsche's theory can be said to be a dead end, and the downfall of Nazi Germany is clear evidence of this. Russell considers Hitler to be a descendant of Rousseau, and Roosevelt and Churchill to be successors of Locke. The Locke school is accustomed to human relationships and worldly affairs, with many fair and sensible people, valuing reason, valuing experimentation, and valuing discussion. They have made more efforts to improve human welfare. The Romantic school only values the country, not the people, praising heroes and shouting for sacrifice, gradually becoming the culprit of world wars. The ideological differences between these two schools are clear and cannot be equated.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Drivers Demand Customs Gold, Don't Be Fooled When Taking a Ride</h3>
<p>A Reader Urges the Bureau to Prohibit It</p>
<p>Recently, it has been reported that rickshaw drivers and tricycle drivers at the city's ferry terminals have been demanding prices from passengers based on the face value of customs gold notes. This has also been heard of in the city in recent days. Passengers who are greedy for petty gains and those who do not often come to Shanghai often argue upon arrival at their destination, each insisting on their own version. Yesterday afternoon around 6 p.m., I personally witnessed a tricycle driver demanding 8,000 yuan from a passenger (who seemed to be a villager) on Yunnan Road and Guangdong Road (without specifying customs gold). The destination was Xiaobeimen. Such a journey, calculated at 8,000 yuan in customs gold, feels unacceptably expensive, because 8,000 yuan in customs gold is equivalent to 160,000 yuan in legal tender. However, such behavior borders on deception and should be prohibited by the authorities. Your newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people. Could you spare a corner to expose it!

<h3>Production Justice</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>If a person takes something from another person, they must pay a corresponding price. If we need to enjoy ourselves, we should naturally exchange it for work. This is a truth as immutable as the heavens and the earth. Because taking things from others without paying a price, or only knowing how to enjoy and not knowing how to work, indicates an uneven distribution of happiness and suffering in society. On the one hand, there is too much enjoyment, and on the other hand, the burden is too heavy. We must know that what I gain is what others lose.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "No merit, no reward." But if we just close our eyes and think, we can know that there are many people in society who receive too many rewards, and the merit they contribute is disproportionate to the rewards they receive. But if we think about what we eat, wear, and live in, which one is not taken from others? However, what exactly have we contributed to the society from which we take? Thinking about it this way, some people in society really should be ashamed to death.</p>
<p>Some may say that what one eats, wears, and lives in is naturally obtained by paying the price of money. People are not willing to let you eat, wear, and live for free, are they? However, we have to ask further: How did you get your money? If it is obtained through cunning or plunder, such as using hoarding methods or speculative means, then such an acquisition can only be called "unearned income." Such a price is not what I call a contribution to society. Because hoarding goods and speculation can indeed be profitable, or even obtain great profits. It may even be the only way to obtain great profits under the current circumstances. However, the profits they obtain are ultimately exploited from people who do not hoard or speculate.</p>
<p>We should know that the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in are not dropped from the sky, but are produced and manufactured by people. Therefore, we must also engage in production and manufacturing, and then we can repay the price of what we eat, wear, and live in. Zhu Zi's Family Instructions: "Every thread and every strand should know that material resources are difficult to obtain. Every porridge and every meal should think that the source is not easy to come by." This teaches people to be frugal. Most people in society take more from society than they contribute to it. How can we waste it again? However, this point only focuses on the negative aspect of saving materials. From a positive perspective, we really should engage in production. The amount of production should at least be enough to offset our own consumption. The so-called "rice bug" and "clothes rack" in common sayings, as I see it, refer to those who only know how to consume and do not engage in production.</p>
<p>But what is production? How can we truly contribute to society? It is not easy to define this point. Farmers work hard to produce grains for us, which is of course real production. Merchants transport goods from one place with surplus to another place with shortage, so that the economy can be adjusted, which can also be regarded as a contribution to society. As for factory employees turning raw materials into finished products, turning things that originally did not have a clear effect into goods that can have an effect, this is of course also a form of production.</p>
<p>Accordingly, although it is not easy to define "production" and "contribution," it is not impossible to find a standard for "production" and "non-production" or "contribution" and "non-contribution." In my opinion, anything that is beneficial to living beings, we make it from "nothing" to "something." This is production. Anything that is truly beneficial to the public, we can call it a "contribution." For example, building a house is making something beneficial to living beings from "nothing" to "something," which is truly beneficial to people. This is "production." If we destroy an original good house, regardless of the purpose, to put it mildly, the crime of not being frugal is always difficult to escape, right?</p>
<p>According to this standard, to be honest, many of today's so-called employed people are not worthy of being called "producers." Checking today's environment, it is really not conducive to production. So many people go to engage in hoarding and speculation. There are many companies and firms that, in reality, are just hoarding and speculation agencies. These types of companies and firms hire managers and partners. They naturally work every day and receive salaries every month. But how can they be called "producers"?</p>
<p>The true so-called production does not refer to "usury" accumulating private wealth. We must know that "making money" and "production" are not necessarily the same thing, just as frugality does not refer to saving money but saving materials. Production should be the production of materials, not the production of money.</p>
<h3>Mickey Mouse Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Since Walt Disney created "Mickey Mouse," it has become a household name. People all over the world know Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>Last October was Mickey Mouse's double tenth anniversary. More than a thousand people celebrated in a hotel in New York to celebrate Mickey Mouse's birthday. Moreover, congratulatory letters and telegrams poured in from celebrities all over the world to celebrate Mickey Mouse's birthday.</p>
<p>American old statesman Bernard Baruch wrote a letter saying: "Every time I see a Mickey Mouse movie, I feel great relaxation and laughter."</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister King wrote: "I am extremely willing to participate in this celebration, because Mickey Mouse gives great joy to men, women, old, and young all over the world."</p>
<p>South African Union Prime Minister General Smuts congratulated him and said: "Regardless of age, we all congratulate Walt Disney. May this father of Mickey Mouse continue to give joy to hundreds of millions of children in various countries."</p>

<h3>"Legend"</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Our country has always believed in the philosophy of "softness overcomes hardness" for thousands of years. It is important not to be too ostentatious in everything. It is best to be smooth in dealing with the world. This is how things should be done, and so should speaking. As the saying goes: "Gossip only comes from too much talking." Disaster comes from the mouth. So in any case, it is best to say as little as possible. Even when it is absolutely necessary to speak, it is important to say things that are flattering to both sides, irrelevant, and ambiguous. This is the art of speaking. As for authenticity and whether words match actions, these are secondary conditions, optional, and do not need to be paid close attention to.</p>
<p>According to the principles of physics, smooth things have the least friction. The same is true for things in general. Being able to be round means there is no danger of hitting a wall. Especially on a path full of thorns, being square-headed is inevitable to break the skin and wash with blood. After being rounded, it can be smooth all the way. It is said that when a fire breaks out, the safest way for people trapped in fur coats is to roll out. Only being round can roll, so they can enter and exit danger without losing a hair. To make speaking achieve a round level, based on my experience, I think the most convenient and simple way is to prefix it with the words "legend."</p>
<p>Among the tens of millions of words, the words "legend" are the most wonderful. A sentence with "legend" added is transformed into three parts mystery, three parts doubt, three parts truth, and one part temptation. If what is said is correct, it is a great way to boast about oneself. If there is a mistake, it doesn't matter. "Gossip heard on the road is not credible." It will never bring disaster to oneself or have any danger of "losing the country."</p>
<p>What's more, the power of "legend" is extremely great. Even if a few "legends" are completely groundless, the listeners cannot help but believe half of it. Therefore, the trend of "legend" is very popular, and over time, it has become a fashion habit. Of course, "legend" also has many aliases and nicknames, such as "it seems," "maybe," "I'm afraid," "big," "possible," "as if," "good to do," "almost," and the like, all of which are two in one and one in two.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this set of magic weapons has been overused, which inevitably reduces its effectiveness. Just like round wheels, they inevitably become rough after being used for a long time. Although words are all wearing the hat of "legend," unfortunately people's ability to distinguish has increased relatively. So in the end, the real is real, and the fake is fake, and they still reveal their true colors, making it difficult to pass off fish eyes as pearls.</p>
<h3>Shrimp</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>Don't underestimate the shrimp that bends its waist. It causes US$60 million in commercial transactions for mankind every year! Moreover, his family is still one of the most prosperous in the ocean world.</p>
<p>A shrimp's life from birth to death is only one year, but a female shrimp can lay 500,000 eggs in her lifetime. However, on average, 499,998 of them will die young, and only two will be able to enjoy their natural life span. Even so, shrimp are still a large group in the sea and also breed in fresh water, which is much stronger than most saltwater animals in adapting to the environment.</p>
<p>There are many types of shrimp, small ones as thin as a hair, and large ones weighing a pound. Saltwater shrimp in the embryonic stage can even survive in liquid air with a temperature as low as minus 190 degrees Celsius. One species can even climb trees.</p>
<p>A few years ago, families in the suburbs of New Orleans, USA, suffered from a large number of unknown small creatures. They made crackling sounds on the floor, and housewives thought fleas had come. Later, after analysis by biologists, they realized that these jumping and bouncing small animals were originally a kind of shrimp.</p>
<p>The oceans all over the world are full of leisure. This phenomenon was of great value to General Adolphus Greely's Arctic expedition in 1880. The expedition prepared enough food for two years. Unfortunately, they were trapped in the icy Arctic for three years due to getting lost. During the period of food shortage, they maintained their lives by catching small shrimp. After eating small shrimp for a year, Winfield, who later won fame in the Spanish-American War. Schley commanded the expedition out of the predicament, but eighteen of the twenty-five members had starved to death; the remaining seven people would probably have turned into frozen bones long ago if they had not been saved by small shrimp.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>A room without books is like a body deprived of its spirit. - Cicero.</p>
<p>A book often contains many errors, but it is still a very interesting book; a book sometimes cannot find a single fallacy, but it is still a dull and meaningless book. - Goldsmith</p>
<p>There must first be good readers, then there can be good books. - Emerson</p>
<p>A book that is read carelessly will not give you any benefit. - Ancient Roman proverb</p>
<p>Among the many things created by mankind, the most important, the most precious, and the most valuable are books. - Gorky</p>
<p>A good book is a treasure house of a great soul's precious heart and blood; its purpose is to leave it to posterity. - Milton</p>
<p>A family without books is like a room without windows. - Johnson</p>
<h3>Records of Pingshui</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Pingshui is located at the foot of Mount Xianglu. It is surrounded by lush forests, with three-tenths of level land. It is close to the Mingdong Cave and remotely connected to the Six Mausoleums of the Song Dynasty. The clouds and water are clear and rich, and it is truly the crown of the seven counties of Shaoxing. It also produces a lot of tea, cultivating water and picking smoke, and the people's strength is also abundant. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic of China, I spent three nights there, mourning the former residence of the poet Jin Hushu Liu Dabai, cherishing incense and fire, and lingering endlessly. Dabai had no descendants. [Editor's note: Dabai's son, Bingzhen, was my Qinghua classmate, and was especially close to my younger brother. Unexpectedly, he committed suicide on the Ping-Sui Railway around the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, and his death was very tragic. On the eve of his death, he visited his friends to bid farewell. Many of them did not know that he had already conceived the will to die. Now I see Mr. Shi's four words, and I can't help but feel sad!] His nephew, Yipo, inherited the sacrifice, and recounted the stories of his ancestors in great detail. Moreover, it is said that the ancestors' original surname was Jin, and Liu was his mother's family. Then the guide led me to what was called the White House, a building facing the stream, where the spirit of poetry seemed to be present. In Kuncun, there are the Shousheng Temple, the Yunmen Temple, and the Pingyang Temple. Some of them have secluded structures, hidden deep in the pine trees, or have clear Dharma drums, and store many treasures from previous generations. At that time, talking about the moon on the futon was a joyful experience that made me forget to return. After the war, I went to the White House again, but the owner could no longer be seen. As for the Shousheng Temple Yile, they have changed their clothes and gone to famous places. Others, such as the ancient temple of Pingyang, have also had its halls collapsed and Buddhas destroyed, with green grass growing wildly. Looking for Qian Muzhai's inscription on the pagoda and Li Chunke's couplets, they are all blurred and broken, and there is no way to identify them. Only the dragon inscription of the Thousand Buddhas Nayi, which was bestowed by Emperor Shizu of the Qing Dynasty, is still stored as before. One catastrophe of war dust has changed the world. How can we be happy!</p>
<p>Mourning the Poetry House of the White House</p>
<p>I used to mourn in Zhu Lane, Dabai and Hu'an, Clear tears melt into ink, Dry frost has not risen on the beard, Even now the mountain is also sick, What can I bear when facing this? A stream of water suspects a poetic dream, Still called White House South.</p>
<p>Shousheng Zen Temple</p>
<p>Three autumn yellow leaves road, A cup of purple lotus lamp, The shadow of us ends, The soldiers tear the ancient rope, The barren fields are full of lying tigers, Wild temples do not return monks, I regret the thick flying ashes, The bright moon decreases and increases by itself.</p>
<p>Elegy to Pingyang Temple</p>
<p>The lamp of fireless temple gate is cold, The Buddha turns into spring mud and the waste altar is green, After the chaos, the double eyes are tenderly opened and closed, Peach blossoms, red beans, ink are all gone.</p>
<p>Planting tea when rice leaves are sparse? The stone is thin like a monk, and the grass becomes fat. The ancient embroidery in the deep palace is three hundred years old, Come and put on the residual photo and reflect the moss clothes.</p>
<p>Staying at Xikeng</p>
<p>The mountain shop in the evening cuts off the lights, Pear blossoms beside the water replace the moonlight, How many times can such a soul be sold? The wind and beard fall more on the traveler's frost.</p>
<p>Viewing Yao Futang's Ink Plum Blossoms</p>
<p>Two or three hat shadows fell into the yellow water, The evening wind blows into the ancient ancestral hall, The old plum blossoms come from the hands of the spirit, The paper can bloom a zhang long.</p>
<h3>Flying Hospital</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In the sawtooth foothills of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, lies a bustling, modern little city called Rapid City, with a population of 14,000. Among them is the renowned Dr. Flad Minty—the "Badlands" flying doctor in American anecdotal history. In 1907, when Minty began his medical practice, even the name "telephone" had not been heard of in the mountain areas. Sometimes, suburban residents had to travel a hundred miles to ask for a doctor, a round trip of two hundred miles, requiring a full day of urging the horse onward. If the illness wasn't too severe, there might still be hope, otherwise, the doctor's return trip would inevitably be in vain. Transporting the patient by train for treatment, not to mention the delay, the jolting along the way would be enough to shorten the patient's life.</p>
<p>Witnessing this situation, Minty resolved to bring blessings to the sick. In 1913, he bought his first airplane, simply hiring a pilot to transport it from the airfield to his hometown, which cost him $2,500. However, this early-stage aircraft, before being formally used, was destroyed in its first landing.</p>
<p>By 1927, Minty recognized that the efficiency of airplanes had improved, so he bought a small plane. At that time, he couldn't fly himself, so he hired a pilot. With the plane, he could reach the homes of patients furthest from the hospital within an hour.</p>
<p>However, the small plane had many shortcomings. First, because the entire fuselage was open-air, it was not suitable for South Dakota's severe winter climate. Second, the load capacity was too small. Once, he wanted to load a fat patient weighing two hundred pounds onto the plane, but the small plane built for two people was too heavy to fly. After this lesson, Minty decided to learn to fly. He truly became a pilot.</p>
<p>Now, Minty has three planes. The newest one is a four-seater, equipped like a flying ambulance, with a stretcher and emergency hospital equipment. He brings medical skills and comfort to families living hundreds of miles from the nearest hospital.</p>
<p>An eighteen-month-old child accidentally swallowed a nail, and his parents urgently telegraphed Dr. Minty for help. Minty flew in, took the sick child and his father back to the hospital. Meanwhile, the worried mother drove to the hospital to find out what was happening. When she arrived at the hospital, Minty had already performed the emergency procedure, and the little patient was resting.</p>
<p>No patient has ever refused to fly, and there has never been a plane crash, although there have been many flights with narrow escapes.</p>
<p>Once, Dr. Minty received an urgent telegram from a family living on top of a steep plateau a hundred miles away. The wind was fierce on the plateau, and they hung a white sheet on the clothesline to indicate the wind direction, allowing the doctor to land safely.</p>
<p>After the patient was examined and loaded onto the plane, the wind became stronger, and the plane had to take off within five hundred feet, otherwise, there would be a danger of crashing into the rocks. Several young, strong shepherds held onto the tail of the plane until the engine reached its maximum speed before letting go.</p>
<p>The plane roared across the field, coming to the edge of the towering cliff. But the engine had not yet reached take-off speed, and it was too late to stop. Minty calmly crossed the edge of the cliff, making the plane plunge down the steep slope close to the ground. When the fuselage seemed only an inch away from the sharp rocks below, the engine finally reached its maximum power, and the plane turned and ascended. In this critical moment, the patient prayed incessantly, and once out of danger, he sighed and said, "Okay, God, I don't need you anymore."</p>
<h3>The Vast World</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>The country with the most telephones in the world is the United States, with an average of one telephone for every five people. Next is the United Kingdom, with one telephone for every twelve people. Telephones are also common in Sweden, with one telephone for every six people, but the total number is less than in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the state of Utah in the United States, prisoners sentenced to death can choose their own method of death—hanging or shooting.</p>
<h3>The Tramp's Post Office</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>There is a Raymer's Bookshop on Third Street in Washington that also operates a mailbox business. Strange geographical names and special requests are very common at Raymer's Bookshop. For example, a customer of Raymer's Bookshop moved from Long Meadow, Massachusetts, to Coquilhatville, Congo, which is not surprising to them. One customer may go away for a period of time, and upon returning to Raymer's Bookshop to collect the accumulated mail, may need a car to carry it back. Another customer has been coming to the bookstore for twenty-five years, but has never received a letter addressed to Raymer's Bookshop.</p>
<p>The original owner of the bookstore was named Raymer, who first started the mailbox service and passed away several years ago. The successor is Mr. Cherson, who continues to run the mail collection service as before. Today, the business has expanded to 600 customers, who pay three dollars a year, leave a permanent address, and pick up their mail at the store themselves. However, requests for the bookstore to deliver mail to their homes can also be accommodated. Some people often change their addresses, making it difficult for regular mail to be delivered, so they have to use a bookstore mailbox. Some people do not have a fixed household, or do not want to give their real address to friends or enemies, so they use a bookstore mailbox. Cherson has a contract with the post office to be responsible for the mail, but keeps the address absolutely confidential, only revealing it when federal detectives occasionally come to inquire.</p>
<p>Mr. Raymer started this service in 1909, entirely by chance. At that time, a tramp asked Raymer if he could use the bookstore as a mailing address. Raymer agreed, and that was the beginning of the mailbox service. Later, the number of people requesting the bookstore as a mailbox continued to increase, so fees were charged as a restriction, with an annual fee of two US dollars. Currently, there are 600 mailboxes rented in the bookstore, with 400 empty boxes waiting for new customers to rent. Mail can be collected directly by customers, but it can also be forwarded to any location in the world where the customer is located.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Fleeting Romance (99)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when a woman is under great stress, if someone can express sympathy and console her emotional pain, it's easy to regard that person as a confidant. In the hospital, surrounded by boredom, loneliness, and depression, Island Cloud took advantage of the situation and captured Qi Wan's heart. At this moment, she only felt that Island Cloud was handsome, gentle, affectionate, enthusiastic, and a promising young man. Moreover, their professions were on the same path. Marrying him, she could either become a celebrity or remain a wealthy merchant's young wife. The future was bright, especially for her current situation, which was very beneficial. At this time, Qi Wan only thought about the positive aspects and did not consider anything else. She was pondering in her heart, and before long, Island Cloud pushed the door open and entered. This time, he had taken off his pajamas and put on a neat suit. His hair was also combed very smoothly. He walked to the bedside and said, "Please forgive me, my heart is like fire. This half hour seems like half a year. I couldn't resist and came in again. I hope Miss Gu will give me a very satisfactory answer." As he spoke, he lowered his head and looked at Qi Wan's face on the bed. She closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again, glanced at Island Cloud, smiled slightly, and closed them again. Island Cloud knew that she had agreed. He was very experienced in this, so without hesitation, he leaned down, put his hands on Qi Wan's shoulders, and kissed her on the face. Qi Wan opened her eyes and said, "You're so clingy, you've made my heart very confused!" Island Cloud saw that the great task had been accomplished, and smiled slightly with great satisfaction: "Now we need to discuss the wedding. Should we get married in Beiping or go to Shanghai?" Qi Wan moved her eyes, concentrated for a moment, and said, "I think it would be best to go to Hong Kong." Island Cloud looked hesitant, touched his head with one hand, and said, "Hong Kong is also good, but not as convenient as Shanghai." Qi Wan said, "I think it's convenient for me in Hong Kong, because my mother is now in Shanghai. I plan to get married in Hong Kong and then go to Shanghai to see my mother. When my mother sees that I am already married, even if she has any objections, she won't object because it's already a done deal." Island Cloud's expression changed slightly when he heard this, and he said, "That makes sense." Qi Wan said, "Do you think there's anything inconvenient about getting married in Hong Kong?" Island Cloud said, "I...I also have my parents in Hong Kong, and I also plan to inform my parents after the marriage." Qi Wan felt embarrassed when she heard this and said, "You think it's convenient in Shanghai, but I don't think it's convenient; I think it's convenient in Hong Kong, but you don't think it's convenient. This is difficult!"</p>
