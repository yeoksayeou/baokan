<h3>立院糧政委會昨計論　長春軍糧票問題　李儻陳良王撫洲說明發行原因</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕立法院糧政委會廿五日晨九時四十分舉行全體委員會，討論發行長春軍糧票問題。出席委負二十餘人，陳紫楓主席，財次李儻，糧次陳良，及財部錢幣司長王撫洲均列席。首由學次長就長春軍糧票發行及使用辦法略作說明後，陳次長報告長春軍糧民食之籌措情况，表示政府對運糧接濟長春煞費苦心，然因交通工具因難，飛機噸位不足，投糧有限，未克盡如理想。旋委員閻孟華，侯庭督，皮德中等多人相繼發言，謂軍糧票之發行違反財經緊急處分令，而於事實上使孤立之長春於財經金融方面亦成孤立，長春市民旣不免仍受高物價及軍政費用之壓迫，在關內之親眷赤無由匯款換濟，殊失公平合理之道。各委員並猛烈攻擊過去強迫長春央行簽發本票，搜歛並囤積糧食，以及大宗匯款入關非法牟圖暴利之特殊階級，主張追究責任。至此，王司長乃說明軍糧票之發行原因，略謂長春央行發行之本票已達東北流通券七十萬億元，如全部收回需金圓券兩億三千萬元，今全國發行金圓券總額纔五億餘元，為顧及全國金融之穩定並保持金圓券之幣值與信用，政府幾經考慮始決定在長春發行軍糧票，以為交易之籌碼，此項措施之成功繫於兩點：其一為能否收回，公教人員及官兵之薪餉多半要匯入關內，可收回不少；另一為能否寬籌糧食，軍政糧食當局均正努力設法中。王氏說明後，各委員對軍糧票之是否仍將因強迫發行再度惡性膨脹，及糧食物資之運供，仍表懷疑，咸認應速謀善策。最後李次長復強調今日長春乃非常時期非常地區，不能以平常觀念考慮其不平常之措施。長春央行一月前本票發行額為四十萬億，一月來增加三十餘萬億，最高曾至一日發行一萬八千億，此一地一月之發行額竟兩倍於全國十年來之發行總額，如此下去實不得了，金圓劵全部發行額二十億元全部置於長春一地亦僅可維持數月。且軍糧仍需繼續收購，糧價亦必須繼續高漲，政府再再思雜研究，最終認為實物本位之通貨為唯一可行辦法，乃有此法律事賞兼顫之特殊措施。現政府正積極致力於糧食物資之輸送，盼各委員重視事實協助政府解決難題。　十二時半數會。下午繼續開會議論該委會辦事細則等案。關於糧政政策及處理糧政人員貪汚經過　案，因時間關係未及檢討，將於下次委員會　中再邀糧部負責人列席備詢。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　幣制改革與物價</h3>
<p>— 段逸珊</p>
<p>自政府頒布財政經濟緊急區分四種辦法，寫布改革幣制後，國內經濟學者專家，均有述評。仁智互見，莫衷一是。聲者本國民一份子立塲，平心靜氣，從客觀方面辭加分析研究，尚覺有不能已於曾者。謹在分析研究以後，更作積極性之建議，以就正於　達。</p>
<p>根據所頌四種重要辦法曁王財長發表談話，深感此次重大改革辦法內容，尚欠缺整個的中心政策。茲分述於次：</p>
<p>政府鑒於通貨惡性膨脹，法幣貶值愈烈，物價繼漲愈　，人民對法幣之信心愈趨薄弱，有根本改工愈建新的足以取信國人之幣制的必要，於是決定發行金圓券，限定二十億圓，以金銀外幣為準備計百分之四十，其他資產值百分之六十，並組繼發行準備監理委員會，公開檢查報告。其目的原在取信於民，並欲以改革幣制為出發點，達到穩定物價，安定民生，而以控制金銀外幣，平衡國內及國際收支為主要手段，用意似甚周密，考慮亦至熟稔。惟環顧國內外經濟政治局勢，與夫經濟原理，目前狀態，對於整理幣制之相關條件，似未達完全配合之境。但經濟現象表現於市塲者，至為自然。運用政治力量之控制，利用人民愛國心理，究竟能維持至何種程度與多久，在國民的立塲，當然惟有以樂觀的心情祈禱，希望眞能由物價凍結而安定民生。不過法幣與新幣兌換率三百萬比一，其他一切因素如果不變，則實際恐將無異大鈔發行。且原有法幣，雖屬貶值，而一萬元之單位仍可作最低限度之交易煤介，現在改用新幣，最低單位為一分，等值法幣三萬元，日常生活方面應用，可以說物價已上漲百分之三百。此為最明顯之現象，不必作學理之研究，已可明瞭。</p>
<p>（三）財政經濟管制辦法夫定，所有物價照八月日市價凍結，不得上漲，工資薪給報酬，幽照八月份指數計算，不得超過，誠是矣。但所有捐稅，規費，以及國營事業之價格，則陸　該戰前標準計算，按照銀元比值，戰前一元，卽為新幣之二圓，國營事業價格與國家租稅如不不加凍結，則按照辦法規定，勢必上漲（按八月十九日價）百分之一百。從財政政策上着想，固可增加國庫收入，但從穩定物價方面推斷，與人民利益直接衝突，寗無領導物價上漲之　？此乃經濟改革辦法上一大漏洞。但如爲穩定物價計，而堅不許國營事業與交通公用事業等調整價格，又不調整租稅，則國庫負担依然，收入未增，收支又何能平衡？故關於此點，在執行時，如不加以技術上之改蕩，　恐有　碍離行之處。</p>
<p>（三）新幣發行，距　幣兌換截止日期，自八十九日至十一月十九日止計遺三個月之長。在此期間，新幣與舊幣同時行使，貨幣數量，益見膨脹，游賢亦將更形充斥。根據費旭氏（Fisher）貨幣數量說，與最近法幣流通速度增加之結果，足資證明與警愓。縱使管制辦法嚴密，游資無從作崇，奸商無所施其伎倆，則經濟活動不自然之結果，亦將逐漸演成市面呆滯，日用品藏區逃避之現象。</p>
<p>（四）新幣與美金折合爲四比一，較之當時結匯證書之美匯（約法幣八百萬元）約提高其原數之二分之一（合法幣一千二百萬元），進口的原料及舶來品今後自然亦因成本之提高而將價格隨之上漲。由於外匯之提高，影響一部份洋貨價格，以及一部份需要外國原料之製成品價格，則凍結物價在八月十九日之規定，久之殆非調整不可。輸出貨品與僑匯或可測因此增加，至於兌入之黃金折銀與外匯，如何作合理之運用，大量游資又如何引導使趨入正途，以及國人存放國外之外匯資產，如何在法律上作有效之控制與登記管理，在未得事實證明以前，外匯上相抵後所收之成果如何，尚待研討。</p>
<p>根據以上四點，可以看出當局此次經濟改革辦法，事前恐未深加考慮。財政當局勇則勇矣，而智慮是否周密，判斷是否準確，不無疑問。尤其是決策上矛盾孔多，或過於承認現實（例如把美匯提高至法幣一千二百萬元），成過於漠視現實（例如把法幣公債定為二萬七千借），缺乏一個整個的維護人民利益為前提的最高原則，由此而建立爭取民心樹立信用的基礎，表示與民更始，切切實實的重建幣信，提高幣值，從而穩定物價，安定民生。因此，如不速為鍋繆補救，則恐難如預期的達到理想的效果。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>此次政府急切實行幣制改革，財政當局一再表示，爲求達到穩定物價安定民生之目的，並由此同籍幣值之穩定，使收支預算，有接近平衡之可能；並希望由預算收支之接近平衡，又再使幣值趨於穩定。此種論點，在理論上未嘗不司以如此說法。但徵之且前事實，政府所實施之穩定物價唯一辦法，抵是凍結在「人一九」的物價，硬性執行限價，舍此無他技巧！此種辦法，在過去抗戰期中，由陪都重慶以至於各大城市，亦曾推行，結果則由限價而議價，始終未見有何成效。目前我國環境，生產與運輸方面，實際上與過去情形恐無多大差別，而幣制改革之基礎，祇建築在硬性限制物價凍結在八一九之市價上。假定限價政策幸而百分之百的成功，則原則上　聲羣集俟復戰前標準一點，如果一且見　實行，物價穩定狀態卽足動搖而有餘。</p>
<p>此外，政府為求達到預算收支之平衡，切實整頓稅源，酌量提高現有各稅，按照戰前標準調整，以裕稅收。歲入方面，據估計，收入金圓計關稅四億八千萬，貨物稅七億，直撥稅三億八千萬，鹽稅三億二千萬，其他各稅及國營事萊盈餘費收入等共二億，出售剩餘物資數　產業等約四億，合共二十四億六千萬；歲出約三十六億，收支相抵預算赤字尚短少十一億四千萬，佔歲出約百分之三十，金圓發行額百分之五十以上。此項不足之數，擬運用美援曁發行金圓公價　補，而軍費　大支出，尚未計入。綜觀收入估計，其中有關社會均平政策之直接稅祗佔三億，其餘部份，均為可以轉嫁之問接稅，在在足以影響物價，精神上似殊嫌矛盾，不足與大刀關斧雷電萬鈞之經濟政策相配合！筆者認為除非政府此項估計，為一種聲東擊西之很步着您，實際上另有國際貸款計劃可以作為後盾，否則此種打算，欲求持以穩定物價，從而維持幣值發生互為因果的作用，恐未必能如何美滿。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>總濟改革之目的，在籍幣制改革，提高幣值，穩定物價，後由穩定物價維持幣值，具有連環作用，則幣制改革之成功，胥視物價在新幣發行以後肥否穩定以爲斷。最高當局復以「只許成功，不許失敗」鼓勵國人，可知幣制與物價，相輔相成，互為聯繫。物價如能穩定，卽幣制之最大成功。新幣制如獲得成功，卽物價愈能穩定，其影響整個經濟政治前途，關係匪淺。客觀環境如此，而先天不足　胎未及足月之之新幣制，卽呱呱隨地，實施辭法又復矛盾百出，然則應如何儘速設法在技術上力求改進從事補救，作後天之調補？筆者認爲應注意以下幾個原則：</p>
<p>（一）整頓租稅，應改從直接稅累進高稅率着手，少作間接稅之調整，以免轉嫁增加消費者之負担，引起物價之不穩定，從而影饗幣值。（例如只圖便利之普遍增加鹽稅關稅等，為最不</p>
<p>（二）發揚我國險約美德，借鏡匈牙利改幣後力自節約所收之效果，躬行實踐，由上而下，造成自發性的節約風氣，第一爲緊縮，第二爲緊縮，第三仍爲緊縮。茲分述辦法於次：</p>
<p>（甲）政府人員自高級政務官起，自身應儘量緊縮，節約一部份享受之物資，尤其是可以輸出之物資，以期增加輸出，換取外匯。</p>
<p>（乙）公務機關應力求緊縮，提秘辦事效率，健全行政組織。國營事業機構，儘量節流開源，在絕不調整價格之原則下，力求自給自足，維特　支平衡，積極生產，以裕物資。</p>
<p>（丙）由上層社會具有領導地位者，提倡節約，以身作則，樹立　質風尚，免除宴客俗套，自動節衣縮食，均平生活程度·養成由上而下之儉模風氣，特別須以京滬一帶大都市，劃為示範區。並以消極方式寓禁於征，按累進稅率重徵奢侈稅，以裕國庫牧入。</p>
<p>（三）切實推行下列的三平政策，整頓租稅，以期開源；厲行節約，求其節流。再配合平衡政策，從事有關各都門點綫之控制，以期推行經濟政策上管制之嚴密，若　在綱，有條不紊，貫澈政府當局之財政政策，達到預算收支之接近平衡。</p>
<p>（子）平實財政收支：</p>
<p>A積極整理公債，維持債信，準備發行金圓券公債，充實國庫，吸收游資。</p>
<p>B整理租稅，提高累進制的直接稅，嚴密稽征，實行均平財富。</p>
<p>C爲爭取幣信，提高幣值起見，嚴格限制發行，按照金我圓券限定發行數額，在可能範圍內更求减低發行數額。</p>
<p>（丑）平衡國際收支：</p>
<p>A新幣制發行後，外匯價格提高，足以鼓勵出口，提高輸出品之數字，換取外匯，學取出超。</p>
<p>B限制非生產品進口，以緩和方式寓禁於征，提高進口稅率，分別物品性質，作積極與消極性之限制，以杜漏巵。</p>
<p>C權衡國內輕重工業生產原料之需要，由政府分別緩急，直接向外國廠家及國內產地儘速購存，公正的平均的供給國內工廠為生產製造之需。</p>
<p>（寅）平衡物資供需</p>
<p>A平抑物價，配合全面（全國各大城市，方得謂之全面）經濟管制，從根本上達到物價之穩定。</p>
<p>B檢查倉庫，合理招待，澈底取締囤積居奇。</p>
<p>C減少行莊，絕對禁止今後的非法經營與業外交易。</p>
<p>D鼓勵游資，流入正當途徑，加強生產工作。</p>
<p>E切實拋售美援剩餘物品，供應真實需要。</p>
<p>F出售國營事業，政府應具真誠，分別小單位逐漸以各個小單位全部出讓。</p>
<p>G控制日用必需品，實行定量分配制度，使無配購證者絕對不得購取；同時促進產銷合作，免除中間商剝削。</p>
<p>H限制消費，課奢侈品及大量消費者以重稅，寓禁於征。綜合以上所述之補救辦法，政府果測採納，以最大決心，沉着應付，相信維持三個月至六個月，當可奠定幣值之基礎。庶幾物價穩定，民生粗安，財政收支預算，可望逐漸接近平衡，而新幣制亦可樂觀厥成矣。</p>
<h3>財部主管人員談　鹽稅調整原因　否認因鹽務僟關不敷開支說</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕近來各方對鹽務機關頗多指摘，記者特訪晤財政部有關主管人員，茲誌間答如次：</p>
<p>（問）報載　務機關稅收不數開支，因而調整稅率，致增高鹽價，加重人民負抓，究竟實情如何？</p>
<p>（答）此次增加鹽稅征率，純為平衡國庫收支，以利改革幣制之實行。按新稅率計算，鹽稅全年約收金圓三億元，依照公庫法悉數解歸國庫，決非鹽務機關所能擅自動支。至鹽務機關經費，在今年手上半年，食鋻稅率每担法幣四十五萬元，半年計收法幣八萬八千餘億元之時，管理部份費用計支法幣八千餘億元，約佔稅收百分之九，稅警部份費用計支法幣一萬餘億元，約佔稅收百分之十四。此次改稅後，今年下半年鹽稅收入預算金圓一億餘元，（其中七八兩月均係照舊率征收折算金圓），同時期之管理部份費用預算金圓五百四十餘萬圓，約佔稅收百分之五弧，稅警部份費用預算金圓約一千萬圓，佔稅收百分之十強。</p>
<p>（問）報載鹽務機關行政人員將近十萬人，組織龐大，是否事實？</p>
<p>（答）全國　務機關各等級合併計算，現共有九百六十個單位，職員工役共有一萬三千二百六十九人，絕無如所傳十萬人之多。回溯戰時實施鹽專賣期問，地區遺比現在狹小，而鹽務機關曾達一千五百六十七個單位，　工嘗達二萬八千二百卅一人。即卅五年復員後，興務機關亦尚有一千四百零八個單位，員工一萬五千三百卅九人，卽可知業在逐步縮减中，至現需如許機關人員，實因地方不靖，產運兩艱，不得不嚴格管理地區，使其供求相應，鹽價穩定，一俟戡建告成，鹽務人員當可集中塲區，儘量裁减</p>
<p>（問）此次改定食鹽稅率每担金圓八元，從戰前平均稅率觀之，究竟是否太高？</p>
<p>（答）現在一般所稱之戰前標準，大抵均指廿六年上半年，其時全國鹽稅率平均每市担國幣六元（相當金圓十二元），故現率每市担金圓八元，實際上僅為戰前平均率三分之二，且此項八元稅率，祗對海鹽，池鹽課征，其內地所產井鹽·土鹽·膏鹽·稅率每市担僅為五元六角，是全國平均稅率尚不及八元。又每人每月至多食鹽一市斤，負担鹽稅最多僅合金圓八分，似不為重。</p>

<h3>維辛斯其重彈舊調　譴責美對蘇備戰　力主軍縮取締原子武器</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿五日電〕蘇聯外次離辛斯基今日直率指斥美國計劃對蘇作戰。聯合國大會一般辯論之第三日，維氏發出聯合國史上對任何國家最嚴重之攻擊稱，茶一大國正留意計劃對另一個國家之戰事。維氏特別提請聯合國建議五張「在一年內减少現有海陸空三軍實力之三分之一」，並取締原子武器。渠作老生常談稱，美國正在促威西方軍事集團，並扶助西德，以發動另一次戰爭。維氏並大事指責馬歇爾計劃，謂「美國之一切作為，莫不同時作各種軍事準備，瘋狂重整武備，並籌策進攻蘇聯及新民主國家。」蘇聯酷愛和平，然美國之對蘇備戰，竟以原子戰為本位。渠指稱，近年來美國外交政策變遷極烈，已從和平外交携入「擴展領土獨觀世界之政策。」維氏演說前，蘇方預測其言必如「炸彈」，然竟不起作用。其動議案如後：（一）五強「為實現軍縮起見，在一年內减少現有海陸空三軍實力之三分之一。（二）確定原子武器係侵略而非國防武器，必須加以取締。（三）「在安全理事會機構內，設置國際管制局，監視並管理軍縮及取締原子武器之施行。」（按蘇聯在安理會內有否決權）。維辛斯基之動機使西方國家大為驚異，而維氏之不提柏林危機，亦感詫異。多人以為維氏將要求駐德四國佔領軍早日撤退，然渠竟絕口不提德國問題。</p>
<p>維氏稱，美國在聯合國內對原子能政策之目的，一在使美國將來能够無限制生產原子彈」。渠簡述美國之外交政策如下：「公開支持若干國家內最反動之帝制，法西斯政權或團結，有系統給予金元及軍備，以歷制各該國內之民主國家解放運動，組織軍事同盟或集團，建設新的海陸空基地，並根據最新軍事之技術需要，擴展並重建戰時所成立之舊基地，漫無止境宣傳對蘇及東歐民主國家之戰爭，瘋在備戰，崇拜原子彈，認為籍此可逃避資本主義世界所面臨之危機；以上卽係美國目前外交政策之特色，至於蘇聯則繼續採取和平政策。」維辛斯基演說甫畢，旁聽席上掌聲雷動，然在二十五分鐘演說時，僅有一次掌聲遮斷演詞，維氏為本屆聯大受聽衆鼓掌最熱烈者。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿五日電〕美代表奧斯汀廿五日批評維辛斯基之演說，為「陳腔濫調」。關於蘇聯之軍縮建議，奧氏稱，「此與過去會議中蘇聯之建議陳陳相因。」法外長許曼稱，雜氏之演詞「豈僅有趣而已，簡直聳人聽聞。」渠稱，聯大應根據維辛斯基之軍縮建議，儘早展開技術討論。許曼又稱，討論可產生很多有用之結果。</p>
<h3>聯大會通過議程　蘇建議遭壓倒多數否決</h3>
<p>〔中央社已黎廿四日電〕王外長今晨於聯合國大會演講中，所積極主張之韓國獨立問題，雖經蘇聯建議提出大會議案之外，今仍以四七票（包括中國）對七票得以保留，蘇聯之建議歸於失敗。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕聯合國大會廿四日擊退蘇聯之取消七個問題列入議程之企圖，此七個問題中除去一個，皆直接或間接有關蘇聯之外交行動，其中大部份與東西間冷戰有密切關係。聯大會表決將綜合委員會廿三百所批准之六十八個問題列入議程，蘇代表馬立克「堅持」要求將此七個問題取消，但蘇聯及其衛星國在七次投票中，皆遭壓倒多數擊敗。馬氏所反對之七個問題及票數如下：</p>
<p>（一）准義大利等七個國家加入聯合國問題，廿九對十六票又十票棄權，通過列入議程。（二）希臘問題，四十四對六票通過。（三）朝鮮問題，四十七對六票通過。（四）修正五強否決權問題，四十七對六票通過。（五）延長小型大會」問題，四十六對六票通過。（六）國際長期合作問題，四十七對六票通過。（七）外國外交人員之蘇籍妻子移民案，三十對七票通過。關於印人在南非受虐待問題，仍議決由綜合委員會續加考慮。此外，聯大會並通過蘇聯集團所提出六個問題列入議程，美國及其他西方國家代表並不反對。蘇代表馬立克稱，西方集團堅持討論賭如希臘及韓國等問題，乃企圖摧毀聯合國。</p>
<h3>王外長聯大演詞　各國反響極良好</h3>

<p>〔又電〕我王外長之演說，在聯合國人士間反響極為良好，王外長以華語發表之演說歷時卅三分種，講畢，鼓掌之聲連續再三，王氏步下講台後，印度首席代表潘迪特夫人立卽趨前與王氏　手祝賀。法國代表團對王氏演說亦表滿意，認為尤其在經濟方面更實有積極意義。</p>

<h3>保加入聯合國　美國重申反對</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕聯合會秘書長賴依曾接保加利亞外長柯拉羅夫來電，重申保國加入聯合國之請求。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕美國務部以備忘錄致保加利亞外長柯拉羅夫，駁其所稱美國反對保國加入聯合國之言，謂據美國之意，保政府現將其人民置於奴役集中營監獄慘刑死刑，故美政府認保國迄未行和約中之質言，而不能加入聯合國為會員。</p>
<h3>聯合國預算盈餘　賴依提報告</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿五日電〕聯合國秘書長賴依廿五日向聯大預算行政委員會首次會議報告稱，一九四八年度預　應有甚多剩餘。渠　，所節賓之費用，可「用以抵補一九四八年度預算所不能逆料諸事項之支出」。該會主席為加拿大之　格里斯，廿五日又選出烏克　之賈　幹。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿五日電〕據悉：美國將要求聯大會對聯合國之費用，加以最高限額，同時對下年度中美國負担之數額，作「象徵性的减削」。按聯合國預算官員建議美國仍負担聯合國全年贊用之百分之三九·八九，據　依秘書長怙計為三千三百四千六萬九千美元，此項數額較美國在本年度付出者少一百卅五萬五千美元。美代表團亦同意在世界其他各地之經濟情形未好轉前，由美國負担聯合國費用之最大額，但要求將數額作「象徵性的减削」，使聯合國任何會員國之負担，不超過聯合國全年費用的三分之一。</p>
<h3>柏林上空蘇機編隊飛行　美提出嚴重搞議　高射砲實彈演習未實現</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿五日電〕蘇聯廿五日公然撕破四強航空安全規程，率直通知英美稱，蘇聯軍用機將列隊飛越柏林佔領區。此舉為兩日內之第二次，顯然旨在威脅西方空輸。蘇聯高射砲廿四日在三條空中走廊一條之末端射擊戰鬥機。美國書面嚴重抗議結隊飛行。</p>
<p>蘇聯照會稱，蘇機將依目光所及航路行動。一美軍官稱，自一千呎以上，被此言一句包括盡矣。「祗須天氣晴朗，吾人能看見飛機，尚無危險，然列隊飛行直接　返航空安全協定。蘇聯蓄意不顧並否認一切四強公認蘇方簽字之航空規定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿四日電〕蘇方廿四日發出一項通知，謂將沿柏林空中走廊演習高射砲。但屆時並未發生演習情事，而各官員亦未重視此項警告，祗視為蘇聯之神經戰而已。緣蘇聯當局告英方稱，蘇聯將於標準時間上午六時在勃肯堡空中走廊附近舉行高射砲實彈演習，該空中走廊聯結英佔領區與柏林之間，美方現亦在加以利用</p>

<h3>蘇駐美大使潘友新建議　提高日平時工業　由強國管制防止作戰潛力復活</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕蘇驕駐美大使館廿四日宣稱，蘇聯已建議，日本工業可在各强图管制下予以「數年」無限制之重振，以阻止日本建設新軍事襪構·此項建議，係在廿三日遠東委員會中提出者·蘇聯大使　友新關述蘇聯之立塲謂：「如不准日本重振共戰事工業及軍國主義，則日本工業發展之提高，其本身不足為患」。</p>
<p>潘氏繼稱，根據蘇聯所建議者，日本之工業發展「將擴大日本出口業之可能性，將有助於增強日本之經濟獨立，並將减低日本國家財政依賴國外因素之程度」·日本工業復興之管制「應由最關心於阻止日本作新侵略之國家等執行之」。此項管制機構應「載於對日和約之內」。潘友新復稱，在開始時，卽須決定何種工業應加以發展，以防止作戰潛力之復活。但「須記住者，日本對遭受日本侵略之害之國家，須滿足彼等合法之賠償要求。蘇聯政府認為並無理由需限制日太未來工業。日本工業應以滿足日本人民和平時斯之需要，為其唯一宗旨。吾人如由此唯一正確基礎出發，則限制日本和平時期工業發展之要求，是否健全，自昭然若捐。」</p>
<h3>史達林親自主持　東歐名領袖會議　會後可測發表聯合宣言</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社布加勒斯特廿四日電〕羅馬尼亞消息靈通方面證實，史達林最近曾在克里米亞與捷總統高德華，羅馬尼亞外長鮑克夫人，保加利亞總理狄米特洛夫舉行會議之說。</p>

<h3>潘友新建議　似締對日和約</h3>
<p>東美官員深感驚異</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿五日電〕美國官員廿五日因蘇聯提議無限制復與日本工業，深感驚異。某一高級人士稱：「如此一提議果屬誠意者」，則美方必加歡迎，但許多方面則保持審愼態度。蘇聯駐美大使潘友新曾在廿三日之遠東委員會會議席間作此建議。一般之觀感，則無疑對蘇聯之建議表示興奮。某一美國官員指出：「此項建議，將能接近規實間題」，渠稱：此一現實問題，卽締結對日和約。潘友新表示之蘇聯態度，至少已較過去有鼓勵性，蘇聯之聲明，卽表示蘇聯贊成及早締結對日和約，美國則早已提出此項要求，中國亦贊成此項行動</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕法總理居伊廿四晚不得不放棄其發表全國廣播演說籲請停止工潮之計劃，因廣播電台在罷工中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕法國廿四日晚又發生一新工潮，使居伊之新內閣陷入危境中·估計有五百萬名工人廿四日會舉行兩小時之總罷工，此乃表示有組織之勞工在攤牌中，有極大力量之警告。同時礦工及重業工人亦咸脅將發動總罷工，以妨碍全國之工業。</p>
<p>此項工漸乃發生於政府決議提高工資百分之十五以慰撫工會之後。共黨及非共黨之工會在以工潮為威脅下，要求提高工資以應付生活費用高漲，各工會要求加薪百分之卅三。居伊於第一次提高工資百分之十，並自稱，超過此數將引起通貨膨脹。廿四日晚居伊再作讓步，同意將工資提高至百分之十五，但工會對此仍不滿意。</p>

<p>獨立後的緬甸，其國策確實令人費解，根據內閣總理泰金諾於本年五月廿六日所宣布的十五點左翼政綱看起來，可說是左到極端。內容主張：馬上與蘇聯獲取政治上和經濟上的聯繫，沒收各大公司的企業，沒收各大地主的土地，實行社會革命等等。但是外長宇廷德，（編者按：宇氏已於九月十八日被人投彈傷重身死），曾在申明緬甸的國策時，却再四說明緬甸的國策，絕對沒有共產主義的傾向。緬甸的國策其所以如此飄忽閃爍，一方面固然是為着適應國際間的利害環境，同時也可說受現在的臨時政府內部人事不協調的影響所致。因為現在的執政黨反法西斯自由同盟，是一個各黨派的組合，其間份子至為複雜。各黨的領袖，各人有各人的思想和信仰，因是各有各的主張。簡單地分別起來，現在的臨時政府內部，可分為親英，中和，與傾向馬列主義等三派。宇廷德等是親英派，泰金諾是中和派，社會黨的少壯份子是傾向馬列主義的社會黨人士，部又與緬共同床異夢，各不相容。因為這些複雄的緣因，也就產生了複雜的國策。獨立後的緬甸，為着補養一下遭受了六十多年剝削的病軀，臨時政府提出了一個復蘇民生的大目標。因為緬甸是農業國，要蘇民困自然要從改革土地政策入手，因此，各政黨皆　相以「耕者有其田」為黨的主義的前提。臨時政府為着適應這種客觀環境，儘管內部份子複雄，也不容不擇上社會主義這條路走。根據英緬協定第七·八兩條，英國人在緬甸的企業，是依舊保有特權的。（英緬協定第七條：（甲）緬甸在緬甸聯邦憲法實施之前，與英籍人民英國商行所訂立之一切合同應繼續有效，緬甸政府應負該合同等所有之一切義務。（乙）英籍人民或當局，在緬甸聯邦憲法實施之前，所有財產與利益，或其與緬甸所訂合同，今後仍舊存在與有效；緬甸臨時政府或任何後繼政府，對於此等財產權利等等應予承認。第八條：英緬兩國政府，決定從早簽定使雙方滿意之商約與航約，在此種條例未成立之前二年，英籍人民所有現行商務或職業及其利益應依舊存在）。緬甸臨時政府這次一方面為避免緬共的以此為攻擊的口實，另一方面也是求企業國家化，以輔導民生主義的實現，乃毅然將伊江輪船公司等英國人在緬甸的大企業收最團有，同時又頒佈了外　在緬的不動產，不得轉讓或抵押，與全部土地收歸國有等條例。緬甸臨時政府這一切行徑，看起來確是在朝向共產主義路上走，兼着泰金諾六月九日發表了反英親蘇的演說，與上述的左翼同盟政網，更令人覺到緬甸　　在實行赤化了。泰金諾於六月九日的民衆大會席上，曾公開宣稱，無論如何，政府決盡力去實現最近所擬定的左翼同盟綱政，如果英緬協定有妨害左翼政綱的話，我們仍願毀棄協定而保存政網；如果有力量的話，還可以向英國宣戰。可是你如果單是拿這些事情來推斷緬甸的國策，那你是錯誤的，因為同樣地有好多事實在表明着緬甸並不左傾，泰金諾那左眞同盟政綱不過是紙上談兵罷了。泰金諾發表了親蘇的言論後，外長宇廷德就馬上跟着來一下鄭重聲明，說緬甸的國策絕對沒有傾向共產主義，同時再三保證緬甸的外交政策無絲毫變更，緬甸決永遠遵守英緬協定的精神。其他如字廷德的辭去外長職務，參加入伍剿共，與政府和緬共的勢不兩立等事實，都可作為緬甸不願左傾的明證。問題談到這裏，記者不妨把緬甸的矛盾國策來分析一下。上面說過，緬甸臨時政府內部人事是分為三派的，社會黨人士確實有意把緬甸赤化，可是和緬共又因權利的關係不能合作。所以主義雖然是共產主義，但事實上　在反共。社會黨人士，一方面為實行自已的主義，他方面為適應環境，與緬共競爭，因是這些人便做出了令人惑　緬甸在實行赤化了的那些事情來。泰金諾是中和派的人物，本是不應該附和在這些人裏面的；泰金諾所以附和的原因，根據記者個人的觀感，認為是相當值得同情的。獨立後的緬甸需要建設，毫無經濟基礎的緬甸要從事建設，必須仰仗英美的援助，這一要決，聰明的泰金諾是不會不懂的。可是非團結自由同盟，無以應付目前的局勢，何况緬共在利用緬甸戰後農村的破產機會，以公有制度的烏托那甜頭來勾引農民。巴莫等在野黨又虎視眈眈地在「岡窺神器」。上述的那些械傾的社會黨人士，在臨時政府裏又具有左右政權的力量，在「先安內而後攘外」的原則下，泰金諾不得不委曲求全，他這種苦衷頗能獲得國人諒解的。</p>
<p>至於被緬共稱為「英國置辦」的外長宇廷德，感到處境困難，遂毅然決然掛冠而去。共產主義是眼前走英美路綫的人的死對頭，雖然社會黨若干人士也在走「黃泥路」，可是這些人比起緬共來，利害關係可以說輕得多，何况算來又是自家人，於是宇廷德才把鬥爭的對象，移在緬共的身上去。一辭去外長後，卽轉入軍界，幷親自到前綫指揮剿共。字氏的轉入軍界，雖遭人反對，（社會黨人也在內）但却毫無挫折地獲到泰金諾的批准，且予以上校銜。由這一點可以看出親英派在規政府裏，尚不至於全無立足的餘地。後來字廷德携其夫人飛到倫敦，仍以外長名義發表聲明稱，「緬甸總理泰金諾與緬甸政府都決定要採取憲法手段，來維護最近獲得的獨立，我們認為任何對憲法實施過程的威脅，—如目前緬共的行動，我們必全力粉碎之。緬甸的軍隊和警察，現在正負擔着這重大的工作，他們對於政府非當忠實，在　甸政府及大部份人士支持下，政府必能毫無困難地在短期內敉平緬共，恢復治安與秩序。緬甸的政策是保持英美及西歐各民主國家的友誼，同時發展其政治和經濟的範圍，所以緬甸也有意和蘇聯及其他東歡國家建立關係。緬甸聯邦幷不反對共產主義，但現在的政府幷無意實行共產主義，至於宣揚共產主義的事情，那全是緬共的事，與現在政府無關，緬甸政府決忠實執行英緬協定，緬甸的國策眞的像宇廷德所說的這樣嗎？這雖然尚有問題，但記者却敢肯定的說一句，宇廷德的國策申明是中肯的。（八日三十日寄自仰光）</p>

<h3>加強各地經管機構聯撃　俞鴻鈞晉京提具體辦法　成品價如有理由可予調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海區兼督導員俞鴻鈞於昨已搭夜車晋京，將向中央提出具體辦法，加強上海及各地經管機構之聯繫。昨日督導員辦公處發表一週來之工作檢討，謂一星期來之本市物，均維持「八一九」原狀，許多日用品之價格且在限價之下。為求物價之長期穩定起見，目前正在調查工廠之生產情狀及原料存量，並規劃增產辦法。此外蔣督導員並約晤各廠負責人交換意見，談話中心為原料問題。自備外應所購之原料准其進口，已進口之原料申報後，准許其自由供應市塲。國內原料則由中央銀行會同各業公會向產地採購，部份資金可由央行墊付。因外埠原料價高，可能影響製造成本，故如有正當理由及事實者，在不影響整個限價情勢下，成品之價格可酌予調整。又目前有若干工廠發生减工停工現象，其理由並非由於原料缺乏，而爲原料之分配不合理，例如針織業卽因配不到細紗而减產。此類問題已解決一部份，統籌辦法則在擬訂中。辦公處目前辦理之取締囤積及存貨登記，希望工商界能　辦。爲求增產起見，硬性規定工人不得怠工罷工，資方亦不得關廠及開除工人。</p>

<p>蔣經國勉勵隊員　勿驕勿餒勿妥協</p>
<p>將督導負首稱：靑年服務總隊的成立，表演上海新力量的產生，希望在靑年人手裏創造出三民主義新中國，求民族生存，國家統一，把人民自苦難中救出。繼勉勵隊員保持淸淸白白的人格，勿驕勿餒，決不中途妥協，並應有大慈大縣救苦救難的精神。及盡忠報國的情神，蔣氏指出上海是一個人吃人的社會，所謂「有條有理」，有金條始有道理，窮苦大衆則被棄置不顧，現秋風已起，希望各隊員不但協助政府肅淸奸商，更應從事實際工作，發動一次廣大的冬令救濟運動，以救窮苦百姓，助淸寒學生，而求上海的安定。最後蔣氏並高呼「上海靑年萬歲萬歲萬萬歲」而結束，蔣氏詞畢，市府秘書長沈宗濺應邀致詞，隊員代表吳士謨致答詞，並通過告全國靑年書，告上海同胞書，上蔣總統電文，最後高呼口號散會。</p>
<p>工作目標</p>

<h3>金桂飄香訪南山　滿覺隴充溢着一片秋的色彩和味覺</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿四日訊〕在中國的國土上，到處都有桂花，不過桂花最多的地方恐怕杭州要算得上一個。杭州在晋代，有一個滿覺隴，那時就植有桂花甚多，當時滿覺院中，許多文士，一到秋天，也都來集會。後來，桂花一年年經過培植，愈弄愈多。杭州人凡結婚的時候，都製就桂花糖奉贈賓客，至今尙然，蓋因桂花時節，正値月圓花香，取其甜實和好之意·滿覺院地方已擴為杭州市一般人民的辦覺區。當時桂花夾道，故俗稱為「滿家弄」，再後一些，文人雅士，以該處正値去烟霞嶺山道，不應稱「弄」，故改名「滿覺隴。」</p>
<p>秋香國　多植桂花</p>
<p>今年滿覺隴的桂花，配合了勝利後的空前浙江巨潮，也大大的開放了一回。陳布雷先生夫婦，同着王福淸先生周佩欽先生，還有本報總經理陳訓念先生夫婦，在看過海寗潮以後，和記者同遊滿覺龍南山一帶，覺得南山如果好好的培植，正可成為「秋香之國」</p>
<p>我們在國曆十九日同看了海寗潮後，回到杭州，翌晨驅車，從湖濱走公路去滿覺隴，先過石屋洞，一到石屋洞口，就有一陣桂花香味，迎面撲來，和尙便來招呼，說裏面有桂花茶。進內，見有桂一化數枝，花朶盛放，跑到洞中，一塊木板的廣吿牌上已用新的白紙寫着「本洞特備自製桂花糖，桂花栗子，桂花票子羹，桂花藕粉，桂花茶」之類。</p>
<p>山徑上　香息陣陣</p>
<p>出了石屋洞沿山路而上，平日此路雖屬山徑，小轎車，吉普車均可通行，現在則行不上五十步，前面已有好幾輛小轎車停着了。捨</p>
<p>行陣陣香味，自雲外飄來，再前數步，卽抵桂花廳，桂花塵者，卽為桂花林，林下置有茶桌櫈。椅，可品茗飲食，林上樹間以一木板漆寫成「桂花廳」三字，此卽為滿覺隴，一變春夏荒蕪·骯髒，零亂散漫的現象。一入桂花廳，卽有人來問要「桂花茶」，「桂花……」等否？有有坐櫈旁現剝桂花隻子出售者，我們買來嚐嚐，確有桂花香味，在此林中，眞是如入「秋香國」，馥郁芬芳，令人欲醉，可惜村人不知培植，砍伐了的不能再種，春·夏·冬三季也不知排除蔓草，殺虫澆肥，任他自然成長，所以本木已沒有五千本，遠不如抗戰前之盛了。</p>
<p>抵水樂洞，還是一樣的有人兜售桂花栗子羹等，出水樂洞，登烟霞洞，一路桂花香味，陣陣撲鼻飄來，洞前空地，我意亦可遍植桂樹。</p>
<p>烟霞洞　翻楊梅嶺</p>
<p>由烟霞洞翻楊梅嶺去理安寺，沿途仍有桂花香，有人稱為「桂花塢」者，道旁桂樹二三，巨大如傘，金落滿地，香氣黨人。兩旁山嶺夾道，都是荒山，旣抵理安寺。經塔塔頂現已坍毀，楠木一枝無存，寺院甚寬大，燭台香健均灰塵盈寸，寺內僅有俗家人二，和尙則闐無一人矣。</p>
<p>理安寺出來，去九溪茶塲，人聲嘈雜，後至者座無隙地。</p>
<p>又去雲樓，戰時樹竹被敵人砍伐幾盡，現在又漸漸成蔭了·兩旁巨樹，合有數抱，濃蔭蔽徑，煞是淸國勝地。至雲栖寺，齊魯大學部份遷移在此，布霄先生對這數百莘莘學子，頗表同情。我們在雲栖又聞到了桂花的香氣。</p>
<p>雲栖返道，過六和塔，錢江大橋，而抵虎跑寺，寺內虎跑泉前，有桂花數本，香溢院外，和尙說這金桂是五百年前的。此地也賣桂花糖之類，遊人如鯽。</p>
<p>南山遊　略抒所見</p>
<p>這次南山的竟日遊，可謂置身在桂花香裏，只是桂花已不如勝利前之多，而空地荒山，反處處得見，不免使遊人感着遺憾，南山桂花旣有如此的號召，似不仿把滿覺覺隴一帶廣植桂樹，而桂花　三字，應刻於石板，永置林傍，滿覺隴應仍設置「滿覺院」·南山通往烟霞洞，楊梅嶺，九溪茶塲，虎跑等處，都應廣植桂花或竹枝松樹，則荒原變為緣野，蕪地成為香土了。</p>

<h3>努力鄉土建設　瓊人擁護改省措施</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　陳梅青</p>
<p>〔本報海口廿一日航訊〕立院終於通過海南改省了，這在海南島人民的心目中，有如大旱之望雲霓，一朝下雨，那種歡欣的情緒，是不可以筆黑形容的。刊載這項消息的當天報紙，頃刻便被搶購一空，市民爭相閱讀。在他們一向愁苦的面壓上，那籠罩着的重重陰霾散開了，無限光明燦爛的遠景，展現在他們的眼前。</p>
<p>他們，羡慕着台灣。他們，希冀着海南島也能「變」成台灣第二，成為全中國一塊繁榮，安定的樂土，好讓他們久經廿餘年匪患和七年多日寇蹂躪的疲乏身心，稍稍得到休息，好讓他們在恢復了全身充沛精力的時候，把這寳島的資源一一開發。　他們，眼看着匪患一天天的蔓延，交通閉塞了，幾村十室九空，生產銳减，作為魚米之鄉的陵水縣城，現在又被攻打甚急，危在旦夕。他們，眼看着敵人遺留下來的冒着黑烟的工廠，停工的停工了，拆卸的拆卸了，「刧收」的「刧收」了，大批有用的物資，也被「五馬分屍」的弄得無影無蹤。他們，眼看着開發年產量七五〇萬担至一〇〇〇萬担的鶯歌海鹽田計劃被扼殺了。他們，眼看着一切建設計劃都是雷聲大，雨點小，到頭來，甚至化作一縷經烟。</p>
<p>他們，眼看着鄉土的凋零殘破，欲訴無門。</p>
<p>因此，海南改省，他們所感到喜悅的，不是單純改省的榮譽，而是一個健全的，人才集中的省府，會把殘破的鄉土建設起來。</p>
<p>記者曾分訪各方面的人士，徵詢他們的意見，大家都一致駁斥那些所謂「條件論」者，什麽「海南還沒有改省的條件哪」，什麽「省政經費還沒有合理的解決辦法前，貿然改省，有害無利」哪，都是一些不必要的杞憂。「行百里者半九十」，只要我們立下決心，硬幹，苦幹，事情終會有成功的一天。特別是海南改省，這一着關係全島二百餘萬民衆的切身幸福，當然絕對支持政府的一切措施的。</p>
<p>關於解決省政經費問題，有人主張由中央補貼一部，一部徵自地方，另按雷州半島劃歸海南省管轄，來負擔一部份賦稅，這樣，經過若干年後，瓊島的匪氛澈底肅淸了，大大小小的工業建立起來，農業改良過來，商業繁榮起來，交通暢達起來，敎育普及起來，做到人人有衣穿，人人有飯吃，人人有屋住，人人有工做，人人有書讀，一切目前的難題，不就完全解決了嗎？</p>
<p>海南島，現在正是臨「變」的邊緣了，正如古人听說；「窮則變，變則通」。</p>

<p>餘油　繼續下降，被鎖有狹隘，本街胃口甚淡，致呈銷化不暢，豆油因籠貨甚多，收市為四十八元五角，生菜油亦挫二元為四十五元收市。生油存稀，獨見堅定。小車蔴油亦降九角。豆餅由廠方分別供應，每戶百片，價四元六角。</p>

<h3>財部電令查禁行莊加額透支</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行稽核處頃通函各分行處，以接獲財部來電，自實施票據當日抵用以來，各行莊常與客戶訂立臨時加額透支契約，以為變相之票據抵用。茲為貫澈政令起見，此項臨時加額透支，應予一併禁絕。又據查報各行莊往來客戶中，其以私人名義立戶者，為數甚多，其中收付正常者固屬多數，但情節可疑者亦屬不少，以後凡有此項可疑之巨額往來，將嚴予追究。</p>
<h3>收兌金銀外幣　決不展期</h3>
<p>逾期持有卽予沒收或處罰</p>
<p>自本年八月十九日，中央頒佈新經濟緊急措施，人民嚴禁持有金銀外幣後，業已月餘。連日市民持金銀外幣，向本市各指定收兌銀行兌換金圓券，頗為踴躍。現距收兌截止期僅有五日，（九月三十日止）限滿後決不展期。行政院昨致電上海市政府知照。根據法令規定，如逾期人民仍持有金銀外幣者，一經查獲，卽予分別沒收或處罰，故預料限期將滿時，市民持有金銀外幣交兌者，必將更形擁擠，希望人民從速送兌，以免過期遭受重大損失。</p>

<p>晨開高盤，龍頭細布喊廿七元四角，較前市收盤猛升八角之多，囤戶仍有吐售，節節盤退至廿六元半，而以廿六元七角收布，軋升一角。龍頭B細布以廿五元收市，軋升六角，五福及喇叭童等低檔細布，各回好五角至七角不等。色布四君子元嗶嘰等均因當令銷旺，四君子元直貢呢叩三十元漲限，餘多帶堅，全市成交計二四六〇疋。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會，昨舉行第三期第三次民營會負廠聯合配紗，共開廿支紗一〇二五件。又據各民營廠廿四廿五兩日自行　開售紗布，報會彙計總額，計析合廿支紗共一四二六件，棉布二二二一五疋。</p>

<h3>教部發言人發表談話　盼流亡生迅速復學　臨中聯中八所足敷收容</h3>

<h3>公開綱球雙打賽　陶王蟬聯冠軍　葉蔡以一比三敗挫　公開綱球全部結束</h3>
<p>公開網球男子雙打王文正陶冠球對葉觀雄蔡國基之決戰，前日賽至中途，因雨停頓，雙方同意成績取消，重行交鋒，於昨日下午三時半，在靑年網球會舉行。觀衆六百人，仍由林寳華任裁判，蔡國基表演出衆，葉觀雄則極為失常，致以一比三敗北，屈居亞軍，陶冠球穩健如常，王文正錯誤百出，令人興人老珠黃之感。四盤比數如下：</p>
<p>陷冠球王文正</p>
<p>六－四　二－六　六－三　六－一</p>
<p>葉罰雄蔡國基</p>
<p>四人登塲稍事練習，卽展開決鬥，王文正開球被葉擊破，蔡取首局，王陶瞬以三對一超出，王文正開球得局四比一佔絕對優勢，詎料好景不常，葉蔡突見振作，尤以蔡國基之攔網，凶險非凡，王陶招架為難，葉蔡扳成各四，王陶不敢怠慢，小心翼翼，卒連取二局，以六對四獲首盤。</p>
<p>繼續交戰，蔡開球猛烈，葉抽擎亦凶，連取三局，勢如破竹，葉開球王陶努力扳回一城，陶開球得局，成二對三，葉于祭發奮，又連下三局，乃以六對二各勝一盤。</p>
<p>第三盤葉蔡乘勢而下，連獲二局，觀衆呼聲不絕，為二人打氣，但入後葉自殺頻頻，蔡亦稍見軟弱，王陶因得以三比二後來居上，此後雙方各得一局，成四比三，惟葉蔡又吿不振，王陶接連刀劈三關，六對三再擴。</p>
<p>第四盤葉似無心應戰，表演益見馬虎，王陶先得二局，葉開球勝一潰局，但入後一蹶不振，連失四局，王陶以六對一吿捷，總計王文正陶冠球以三比一克葉蔡，嬋聯雙打冠軍。二屆公開網球，至此全部結束。</p>

<h3>郝更生對中小敎師　講英美小學體育　英國重視體育師資</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時市體育館邀請郝督學更生，演講英美小學體育，本市市私立中小學體育敎師，曁熱心體育人士，到館聽講者，有七百餘人，事前由電化敎育團裝置擴音機，聲浪淸晰，語語動聽，首由邵館長致辭，繼請郝氏演講，節其要義如下：</p>
<p>英美對於體育，十分重視，尤其是兒童體育，為人生最重要的階段，是培養成人的基礎。英美在世運會優異成績之表演，完全得力於兒童健康敎育之設施，兒童健康，須有良好的營養與睡眠，及適當運動。小學體育為兒童敎育，最重要的訓練，卽一般體育的培養，應從小學體目做起。英國經濟情形遠遜於美，但對於兕童體育，無不十分注意。（一）英國雖無完美之設備，但有廣大之塲地，盡量利用，使兒童有充分活動的機會。（二）英國能利用環境及設備，卽一桌一繩，可作兒童活動的工具。（三）注重兒實遊戲運動，訂定分組辦法，以期活動普遍。（四）將體育遊戲活動，配以電影或幻燈片，更易于奏効。（五）學校衛生環境佈置，均甚注意，運動休息，均有適當塲地。（六）注意兒童身體發育之生長現象，檢查兒童體格及良好習慣之養成。</p>
<p>英國現有口號「良好的制度固然要緊，良好的敎師比制度更重要，」因此英國有普遍而嚴格的體育師資測驗，凡為體育敎師，均須參加此項測驗考試，造成優良成績為榮，也是增進體育敎師進修之機會。女子敎育非常重視，雖以良母為主，而小學體育程度之提高，應歸功於女子敎育。</p>
<p>美國小學因其資源富足，體育亦普遍發達，足資參考者甚多。最後希望體育界負起兒童體育敎育之責任，在困難環境中，繼續努力，相信我國小學體育，必有光明的前途。</p>

<h3>老婆可怕？</h3>
<p>— 秦嶺</p>
<p>讀十九日本刋所載許欽文先生的「老婆的可怕」一文後，感慨萬端，寫上幾句為老婆階級辯護。</p>
<p>欽文先生的原意，不過是以丈夫的悲哀襯托生活之不易；然而，老婆竟因此被認為可怕，也何嘗不是老婆的悲哀。</p>
<p>老同學密斯丁——現在應該稱她馬太太了——常常寫信來訴苦，三個孩子把她磨死了。未勝利時住在重慶沙坪　的鄉村裏，担水爬泥土，吃着自己稱植出來的蕃茄，馬鈴薯，穿着補上加補的布大褂，滿以為到了上海可以舒服一下，誰知化了幾年來的積菩只租到一間前樓，還是闔家擠在一起，還是整日不斷的操作。以前彈鋼琴的手生了老繭，頭昏貧血把素昔愛美的她糟得不像人樣。可是，馬先生的脾氣却隨地位同時增高了，動不動使性子摔東西。孩子吵了不能看書是太太的不是，上班太晚誤了公事是太太的不是，一個月薪金不够半月開支更是太太不應該！兩口子時常吵架，感情相當惡化。論事實，馬光生沒有外遇，沒有嗜好，早出晚歸，非常規矩，其實還是經濟問題作祟，錢不寬裕，心緒不佳，脾氣也變壞了。這當然不是馬先生的過失，物價天天上漲，自己克勤克儉，一月所得還是不够化，怎麼不糟心？可是，能說是太太的過失麽？</p>
<p>再講老友黎小姐吧，最近有信來決定離開北平南歸了。她是前年夏季去北平結婚的，夫婦倆都是公務員，去年養了個孩子，僱個老媽子看家帶小孩，她在上班之外還帶奶，結果孩子孱弱不堪，自己也累得精疲力盡。她總吿訴我們：「現在您若看見我定會大吃一驚的，因為，我比在上海時瘦了差不一半了！」更急人的是今年夏季又添了個孩子。她說：「我們二人同時上班，一個老媽子不肯帶兩個小孩，屬兩個老媽子又是經濟能力所不許。自已坐在家裏領孩子吧，他一人的收入根本不够維持，沒有辦法，只得南歸啃祖產了！」」</p>
<p>旣有了家庭，誰不希望生活得美滿恬靜？，拉長了臉生氣倒底不是愉快的事。作太太的只要能工作，無有不願帮助丈夫分擔責任的，可是原則雖然如此，萬一孩子太多，顧此失彼，便不得不退而治家。（就是這方面，女子也是頗為犧牲自己的。）我們生活在這個時代裏，夫婦間需要共同耐勞習苦，諒解體恤，才能克服因難，共渡時艱，不是互相埋怨譴責所能解決的。</p>
<p>近來，家庭糾紛成了主要的社會問題之一，這種實例使朱婚的人對「結婚」懷着疑慮與恐懼，「老婆」這名詞，在我們女子看來，倒的確是可怕的。</p>
<h3>新發明</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>紐約有一個奇才，他發明了一種對裝着一把小扇子的湯匙，扇子能將湯匙內的湯吹凉，使喝的人不致於燙得縮頭吐舌。</p>
<p>華感頓州司普甘地方有一個人發明了一種牡　剖開器，並且已向政府註册專利。這種專供剖食牡　用的新器械會發出一種聲響，聲響能够刺激好奇的牡蠣張開牠們的殼，乘着蠣榖張開的時機，吃的人便可經易的將牡蠣的肉挖了出來。</p>
<p>美國陸軍曾在叢林中利用聲響誘殲傳染疫癘的蚊子。他們製造了一種「狼嗶」音又，這種音父所發生的音調和雌蚊的翅膀撲動所發生的音調相似。愚　的雄蚊循着人造的　　之聲前來朮偶，結果成了死於音又之下的風流鬼。</p>
<p>摩登婦女在理髮店所消磨的時間實足驚人。加利福尼亞州有一個男子為了解除婦女在「做頭髮」時的無聊起見，創製了一種新型的「吹風」，裏面裝着無綫電收音機，可以隨時收聽解悶，誠為消閒聖品。</p>
<p>耶爾湯尼公司發明了一種「獨臂」彈簧門閂。裝了道種門閂，一個雙手滿載而歸的人在開門鎖和轉門上的把手時便不用把兩隻手的東西都放掉，僅祗空出一隻手便能够開門入室了。</p>
<p>有一個製造商業已設計出一種新型的電動洗衣機，這種洗衣機不但會洗衣服，並且也會刨洋山薯和凍冰淇淋。</p>
<h3>美國的怪法律</h3>
<p>— 起鳳</p>
<p>你想得到嗎？假如你在美國威期康辛州的酒吧間內唱歌，在明尼浦里斯州內駕駛深紅色的汽車，在奧克勒荷馬州內竊聽別人說話，在羅特島州上女子穿了透明的衣服（包括玻璃絲襪），都是算觸犯當地的法律的！</p>
<p>動物倒同樣地受到法律的保障。在俄亥俄州，你如果騎一匹牡驉的話，決不能超過一小時六哩的速度；在北卡羅理納州你不能用一隻象來代替牛。馬或機械來耕種棉田；在奧克勒荷馬州你不能在內海捕捉鯨魚；在賓夕佛尼亞你甚至不能殺死一條蛇，除非牠來咬你！</p>
<p>一般人以為美國的男女之間是極放縱而自由的，但也不盡然·在俄勒岡州，根據當地的法律，一們女孩倘若沒有監護人的倍伴就不能隨一們靑年的男子同車；在友太州男女們只能在白天跳舞；在賓夕佛尼亞州，女子的內衣不能掛在曬衣繩上，除非外面用一塊布遮着。</p>
<p>就是男女間的談情說愛，法律也不曾予以絲毫的疏忽。不多年以前，一們倒楣的丈夫被罰了十五元，因為他在芝加哥的公園內吻了他的妻子。在喬其亞州，公共地方接吻也在禁止之例。求婚的方法倒簡單別緻而且易於實行：在馬薩丘賽州，你祗要與你的愛人親吻十次就算求過婚了；在明尼蘇達州，你祗要帶幾色糖果禮物，在你心上人的父母前熟烈地擁抱她，吻她，就足够表示你有愛她欲娶她為妻的意思了。</p>
<p>等你一結婚，如果你居住在特拉衛州，你可對你妻十作任何不敬或　凟的言語，法律決不千涉；在密歇根州，法律給予丈夫以他妻子衣服的所有權，假如妻子一且離他而去的時候，她的衣服就全部歸丈夫所有了。</p>
<p>更荒謬而無理的法律是在紐約州父親不能為他的孩子換尿布，波斯頓的居民不能養一隻站起來高於十吋的狗；肯塔基的竊賊祗有在夜晚可以捕捉；印第安那州中男人的鬍髭是被認為細萬的傳染物品，尤其是常常與人接吻的男子十不准留鬍髭；南卡羅里納的犯人坐囚車到監獄時，還一定要付給警察一元錢的東錢呢！</p>
<h3>捉賊</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>昨晚夜深，附近某茶葉肆之棧房，忽大喧鬧，間以嘩笑之聲，響震四鄰，侵晨詢之，始知捕得竊賊，頗可一噱。因賊係穿牆而入，早為各茶工聞悉，乃以一極大之篾簍（平時貯茶葉者），於其所穿處候之，見其將牆穿洞，匍匐而進，迨至全身悉入，尙未起立時，茶工急將茶簍從頭罩下，將賊全裝人簍，而被擒獲。喧鬧嘩笑之聲，亦於此時大作，蓋是時正諸茶工志得意滿時也。</p>
<p>憶昔時某校宿舍，有穿　之賊，為諸生所知，乃於洞口結繩為圈以待。賊以一足先入，恰入圈中，諸生急束繩結，將賊足繫住，而賊之全身，猶在牆外。諸生共籌懲賊之法，有滑稽者，主去其鞋襪，以堅硬之毛刷，刷其足心，使其奇癢難熬。賊果懼癢，每一刷，則足抽掣顫動，窘迫萬狀，而諸生亦譁然大樂。不料愈刷愈急，賊不勝其虐，盡力掙脫，繩竟為斷，而後瀕大河，因奮身騰出，竟砰然一聲，墜入河中，河水深且急，不知此賊漂流何處矣。</p>
<h3>標凖美國人</h3>
<p>— 風鈴</p>
<p>美國最有名的民意測騐機構蓋洛普民意測騐所報吿，一們標準的美國人是這樣的。</p>
<p>他的身高為五呎九吋，體重一百五十八磅。（這是美國男子的平均身高體重。）</p>
<p>十個男子中，六個喜歡黑髮黑眼的女子。</p>
<p>美國女子平均身高五呎四吋，重一百三十二磅。</p>
<p>每三個成年的人（包括男女）中，兩個是戴眼鏡的。每五個人中必有一個人耳朶微幾。十個人中有一個人喜歡用左手操作·</p>
<p>美國人一般說來記性都不大好，能够記得自己汽車照會的號數的，不到三分之一。</p>
<p>三們人中必有一人不肯早起，五個人中有一人常感失眠。</p>
<p>普通的美國人都在十點鐘睡覺，每星期中有六天是早上六點半就起身的，但他在星期六晚上却常要到十一點才睡，睡到星期日早晨八點鐘才起來。</p>
<p>十個美國成年人中，六個人喜歡喝酒抽烟。</p>
<p>百分之九十六的美國人相信有上帝，百分之七十六相信死後還有靈魂。</p>
<p>全美國的人民中祇有百分之四的人覺得生活過得不快樂；百分之五十七的人覺得尙堪滿意，百分之三十八的人覺得生活極好，極快活，但是也有百分之一的人覺得他們自己也不知道究竟是不是快樂（譯自九月份雜誌文摘）</p>
<h3>南社巨子龐檗子</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>龐樂子為南社巨子，名滿江南，乃謗亦隨之，至不見容於鄉里。殁後烏程周夢坡吳江柳棄疾輩集貲刋其詩詞遺稿，其鄉人亦不出分文。蕭先生退闇為之作傳，退闇亦不樂居鄉里者也。</p>
<p>檗子名樹柏，號芭庵，常熟人。淸季共柳棄疾陳去病輩組織南社，倡導民族主義。辛亥軍興，槃子時任約翰大學敎授並國粹學報編輯。上海光復，業子與宋教仁輩參與蜜勿。常熟反正，亦緣檗子首謀。檗子年少勇於任事，倡議廢除差役，蓋差役為民病也久矣。一日，檗子啜茗湖園，差役數十百人手炷香焰熊熊，佯請命，蜂擁炙其顯額焦爛，幸有人挾之越牖以逃，乃得脫。復至海上，任滬軍都督文讀。然鄉人謗之者猶未已也。遂絕意世事，以文酒自遺，終乃頹然自放，卒年僅三十三耳。朱古微侍郎點定其所為「玉琤瑽館詞稿」，一時名人魁士，若邵次公徐仲可吳瞿安葉社漁輩，俱有題詞，柳棄疾王德鍾王專農則分別為之序跋·其「龍禪室詩」則附於詞後。榮子詞規撫南宋，不越白石玉田寸步，持律最嚴，宜為朱古微所深賞也。其「桃源憶故人」一闋，以「雨絲風片烟波畫船」八字領句者，風致尤勝。其詞曰：「雨濛濛裏春無影，絲柳也如人病；風剪羅衣還冷，片夢先花醒。烟　隱約靑難認，波漾趨塵催瞑；畫取舊時芳景，船載江南恨。」</p>
<p>宋敎仁殉國後，每歲値其忌日，樂子輒為流涕。嘗有詩哭之曰：「…抉目至今悲伍相，招魂何處哭三闆？從知才命生難共，但說恩仇計已疏。…」其辭絕沈痛。才命一聯亦可移以悼　子也。其著作尙有「靈嚴　唱」，「龍禪室摭談」，及遺文若千篇，日記若干册。</p>
<h3>馬蹄和騎士</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>我們在公共塲所中常常看見許多銅像石像，其中有不少是騎在馬上的名將。但是我們除掉欣賞這些英雄們的丰采之外，却很少知道：他所騎的那只馬的姿勢，實在暗示了這位英雄的遭遇。</p>
<p>西洋的雕塑家有一種共同遵守的慣例，這慣例就是關於「馬脚和騎士」的；</p>
<p>（一）如果雕像中那只馬兩隻後蹄着地，兩只前蹄騰空，那意思就是—騎那只馬的武士是戰死沙塲的　。</p>
<p>（二）如果馬的三只脚着地，有一隻蹄舉起在空中，就表示騎那只馬的人曾在戰爭時負傷。</p>
<p>（三）如果馬的四只蹄都安然着地，就表示騎這匹馬的武士沒有在戰爭中負傷。</p>
<p>這些慣例，在歐美各國是一律通行的。不過我們中國的雕塑家是否照辦，却就不曉得了。</p>
<h3>洞天福地</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>一個眞正的好作家會一開頭就把讀者拉入另一世界，去賞玩其中的奇景異物。讀者讀畢其書，就如往另一天地中遊歷了一番歸來一般。此蓋由於古今中外的好作家自己另有一個世界，另有一個天地，另有一個乾坤，另有一個宇宙。</p>
<p>耶敎謂上帝創造天地萬物，眞正的好作家亦能創造天地萬物。</p>
<p>古時的作家，其身是死了，其所創造的另一天地却還是保存於其所著文籍裏，只須將其大門上的蛛網塵埃拂拭一下，其中亭台樓榭，林泉山石，固大都完整無恙也。</p>
<p>天地誠非只是一個，在蛛網塵封的文籍之中就保存着許多洞天福地。只因其中並無黃金景，更無顏如玉，是以遊人甚為寥落耳。</p>
<p>至謂今日洞天福地之門票售價甚貴，誠然；然亦未必比看一塲影戲的代價貴多少。且此洞天福地不比人間一般的洞天福地，你只須購了門票，此洞天福地便終身屬你所有，成了你的私國，你隨興之所至，隨時可以往遊，日遊夜遊，悉隨尊意。更方便的是：竟還可以坐遊臥遊。</p>
<p>憶讀東坡詩集時情境，忽獲此感，為述如此。</p>

<h3>The Disparity in Numbers is Huge, the Eastern Gate is Breached by Bandits, Street Battles Everywhere in Jinan City, Communication Between Beijing and Jinan Suddenly Cut Off Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 25th] The battle of Jinan, which has lasted for more than ten days, saw the bandits launch a full-scale assault on our forces. The national army bravely resisted, inflicting over 50,000 casualties on the bandits. The fighting, which began on the 20th, has been continuous, with both sides engaging in repeated attacks day and night. The fighting became even more intense at night. The bandits concentrated more than 130,000 troops from eight columns, including the 3rd, 7th, New 8th, 9th, 10th, 13th, Bohai, and Rapid Columns, launching fierce attacks on the southeastern corner of the inner city from the outer city, engaging in house-to-house combat with the national army. Due to the overwhelming number of bandits, the eastern gate was breached by the bandits by dawn. Fierce fighting is now taking place in every street and alley within the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 25th Morning Dispatch] The bloody battle in the suburbs of Jinan on the 24th has not ceased for a moment. In the afternoon, the bandits launched a dense and fierce attack using human wave tactics, several tanks, and dozens of artillery pieces.

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] The defense of Jinan has lasted for ten days. Wang Yaowu led his troops with the determination to perish with the city, severely punishing the invading bandits and inflicting great damage on them. However, due to the overwhelming number of bandits and the lack of external support, they have been plunged into a bitter battle. According to sources here, the bandit forces attacking the Jinan city walls broke into the city gate again at 4:00 PM on the 24th, and the fighting became even more tragic. As of the morning of the 25th, communication between Jinan and here was suddenly cut off. During an emergency meeting held by the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 25th, Minister He Yingqin reported on the progress of the defense of Jinan in detail.

<h3>The War in Western Liaoning Escalates, Bandit Forces Fiercely Attack Jinzhou, Yixian is Enveloped in Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 25th Dispatch] The war in western Liaoning has escalated. On the night of the 24th, bandit forces began to attack Jinzhou.

<h3>The Legislative Yuan's Grain Policy Committee Discussed the Changchun Military Grain Coupon Issue Yesterday, Li Tang, Chen Liang, and Wang Fuzhou Explained the Reasons for Issuance</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan's Grain Policy Committee held a plenary meeting at 9:40 AM on the 25th to discuss the issue of issuing military grain coupons in Changchun. More than 20 committee members attended, with Chen Zifeng chairing the meeting. Vice Minister of Finance Li Tang, Vice Minister of Grain Chen Liang, and Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance Wang Fuzhou were also present. The Vice Minister of Education first gave a brief explanation of the issuance and use of military grain coupons in Changchun. Vice Minister Chen then reported on the situation of raising military and civilian food supplies in Changchun, stating that the government has been working hard to transport grain to Changchun, but due to the difficulties of transportation, the insufficient tonnage of airplanes, and limited grain deliveries, the efforts have not been as ideal as hoped. Subsequently, committee members Yan Menghua, Hou Tingdu, Pi Dezhong, and others spoke one after another, saying that the issuance of military grain coupons violated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, and in fact isolated Changchun in terms of finance and economy. Changchun citizens are inevitably still subject to high prices and military and political expenses, and relatives inside the pass have no way to remit money for relief, which is unfair and unreasonable. The committee members also fiercely attacked the special classes who had previously forced the Changchun Central Bank to issue promissory notes, hoard grain, and illegally profit from large remittances into the pass, and demanded accountability. At this point, Director Wang explained the reason for the issuance of military grain coupons, saying that the promissory notes issued by the Changchun Central Bank had reached 70 trillion Northeast circulating notes. If all were to be recovered, it would require 230 million gold yuan. The total amount of gold yuan issued nationwide is only 500 million yuan. To ensure the stability of the national finance and maintain the value and credit of the gold yuan, the government, after much consideration, decided to issue military grain coupons in Changchun as a bargaining chip for transactions. The success of this measure depends on two points: first, whether it can be recovered. The salaries of public servants and soldiers are mostly remitted into the pass, which can recover a considerable amount; second, whether it can raise enough grain. The military and political grain authorities are working hard to find ways. After Wang's explanation, the committee members still expressed doubts about whether the military grain coupons would again be forced into circulation and experience malignant inflation, and about the transportation and supply of grain and materials. They all agreed that a good plan should be devised quickly. Finally, Vice Minister Li emphasized that Changchun today is an extraordinary period in an extraordinary region, and its extraordinary measures cannot be considered with ordinary concepts. The amount of promissory notes issued by the Changchun Central Bank a month ago was 40 trillion, and it has increased by more than 30 trillion in the past month. At its highest, it issued 1.8 trillion in one day. The amount issued in this one place in one month is twice the total amount issued nationwide in the past ten years. This cannot continue. All 2 billion yuan of gold yuan issued nationwide can only last a few months if placed entirely in Changchun. Moreover, military grain still needs to be purchased, and grain prices must continue to rise. The government has repeatedly studied the matter and ultimately believes that a commodity-based currency is the only feasible solution, hence this special measure that combines legal and factual considerations. The government is now actively working to transport grain and materials, and hopes that the committee members will pay attention to the facts and assist the government in solving the problem. The meeting was adjourned at 12:30. The meeting will continue in the afternoon to discuss the committee's procedural rules and other matters. The case regarding grain policy and the handling of corruption by grain officials was not reviewed due to time constraints and will be discussed at the next committee meeting, with responsible officials from the Ministry of Grain invited to attend and answer questions.</p>

<h3>Regulations on Declaring and Registering Foreign Exchange Assets Abroad: Four Provisions for Reserved Amounts; Approved by the Political Affairs Conference and to be Promulgated and Implemented Immediately</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The proposal on the amount of foreign exchange assets to be retained after declaration and registration has been passed at the provisional political affairs conference on the morning of the 25th, and will be promulgated and implemented immediately. According to Article 9 of the "Regulations on the Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China," submitted by the Ministry of Finance: "For foreign exchange assets declared and registered in accordance with these regulations, the original foreign exchange asset holder may be allowed to retain a certain amount of deposits and foreign currency income or proceeds from the sale of assets that were already abroad when these regulations were promulgated, without depositing it in the Central Bank," the Ministry has formulated four provisions for the reserved amount, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For living, medical, and travel expenses required by the person or their direct relatives or registered spouse residing abroad, a reserve of US$5,000 or its equivalent in other currencies shall be allowed for a population of three or fewer people, and for each additional person exceeding three, an additional US$1,000 or its equivalent in other currencies may be reserved, but the total amount shall not exceed US$10,000 or its equivalent in other currencies.</p>
<p>(2) For those studying abroad at various levels of schools, US$2,000 or its equivalent in other currencies may be reserved for tuition per person if they are studying at colleges or above, and US$1,000 or its equivalent in other currencies may be reserved for tuition per person if they are studying at secondary or below.</p>

<p>(4) Those whose family members or their direct relatives or spouses are confirmed to return to China within one year after August 19, 1948, may reserve the amount of the fare for train, boat or plane tickets necessary for the number of people returning to China, plus miscellaneous expenses of US$200 or its equivalent in other currencies per person along the way.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Handling Measures for Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Deposited in Courts</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] All persons holding gold, silver, silver coins, or foreign currency are required to submit them to the Central Bank or its entrusted banks for exchange into Gold Yuan notes before September 30, 1948, which has been stipulated and announced by the government.

<h3>Weekly Forum: Currency Reform and Prices</h3>
<p>— Duan Yishan</p>
<p>Since the government promulgated four measures on emergency divisions of financial economy, writing and announcing currency reform, domestic economists and experts have made commentaries. Different opinions were presented, and no consensus was reached. The author, standing as a citizen of the country, calmly and objectively analyzes and studies, and still feels that he cannot but speak his mind. After analysis and research, the author makes proactive suggestions in order to solicit corrections from the enlightened.</p>
<p>Based on the four important measures and the speech delivered by Finance Minister Wang, I deeply feel that the major reform measures lack an overall central policy. I will elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>The government, considering the vicious inflation, the more severe depreciation of legal tender, the continued rise in prices, and the weakening confidence of the people in legal tender, deemed it necessary to fundamentally change the old and establish a new currency system that can win the trust of the people. Therefore, it decided to issue Gold Yuan notes, limited to 2 billion yuan, with 40% backed by gold, silver, and foreign currency, and 60% backed by other assets, and established a Supervisory Committee for Issuance Reserves to publicly inspect and report. The original purpose was to win the trust of the people, and to use currency reform as a starting point to stabilize prices and secure people's livelihoods, while controlling gold, silver, and foreign currency, and balancing domestic and international payments were the main means. The intention seemed very thorough, and the consideration was also very mature. However, considering the domestic and international economic and political situation, and the principles of economics, the current state of affairs, the relevant conditions for consolidating the currency system do not seem to be fully coordinated. But the economic phenomena manifested in the market are very natural. How long can the use of political power for control, and the use of the people's patriotism, ultimately be maintained? From the perspective of the people, of course, we can only pray with optimism, hoping that prices can truly be frozen and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. However, if the exchange rate between legal tender and the new currency is 3 million to 1, and all other factors remain unchanged, then in practice, it may be no different from issuing large denominations. Moreover, although the original legal tender has depreciated, the unit of 10,000 yuan can still be used as a minimum means of transaction. Now, with the new currency, the minimum unit is one cent, equivalent to 30,000 yuan in legal tender. In terms of daily life applications, it can be said that prices have already risen by 300%. This is the most obvious phenomenon, and it can be understood without academic research.</p>
<p>(Three) The Financial and Economic Control Measures stipulate that all prices are frozen at the market prices of August, and are not allowed to rise. Wages and salaries are calculated according to the August index, and are not allowed to exceed. This is indeed correct. However, all donations, fees, and the prices of state-run enterprises are calculated according to the pre-war standards, according to the silver dollar exchange rate. One pre-war silver dollar is equivalent to two new currency yuan. If the prices of state-run enterprises and national taxes are not frozen, then according to the regulations, they will inevitably rise by 100% (according to the price on August 19). From the perspective of financial policy, this can increase the national treasury revenue, but from the perspective of stabilizing prices, it directly conflicts with the interests of the people. Is there a potential to lead to price increases? This is a major loophole in the economic reform measures. However, if prices are to be stabilized, and state-run enterprises and transportation utilities are not allowed to adjust prices, and taxes are not adjusted, then the national treasury's burden remains the same, and revenue has not increased. How can revenue and expenditure be balanced? Therefore, regarding this point, if technical changes are not made during implementation, there may be obstacles to implementation.</p>
<p>(Three) The issuance of new currency, from the start of currency exchange to the deadline, from the 19th of August to the 19th of November, is a long period of three months. During this period, the new currency and the old currency are used simultaneously, and the amount of currency will be more inflated, and the floating assets will be more abundant. According to Fisher's quantity theory of money, and the recent increase in the velocity of legal tender, this is enough to prove and warn. Even if the control measures are strict, floating assets cannot be manipulated, and unscrupulous merchants cannot use their tricks, the unnatural result of economic activity will gradually evolve into a stagnant market and the phenomenon of hiding daily necessities.</p>
<p>(Four) The new currency is pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 4 to 1, which is about half of the original amount (approximately 8 million legal tender) of the exchange certificate (approximately 12 million legal tender). Imported raw materials and imported goods will naturally increase in price due to the increase in cost in the future. Due to the increase in foreign exchange, the prices of some foreign goods and some manufactured goods that require foreign raw materials will be affected, then the regulation to freeze prices on August 19 will eventually have to be adjusted. Exports and overseas remittances may increase as a result. As for how to reasonably utilize the gold and foreign exchange converted, how to guide a large amount of floating assets into the right track, and how to effectively control, register, and manage the foreign exchange assets deposited abroad by the people in legal terms, the results of the foreign exchange after offsetting remain to be studied before factual proof can be obtained.</p>
<p>Based on the above four points, it can be seen that the authorities may not have given deep consideration to the economic reform measures this time. The financial authorities are brave, but there are doubts as to whether their wisdom and judgment are thorough and accurate. In particular, there are many contradictions in the decision-making process, either overly acknowledging reality (for example, raising the US dollar exchange rate to 12 million legal tender), or overly disregarding reality (for example, setting the legal tender public debt at 27,000), lacking an overall supreme principle that protects the interests of the people. From this, the foundation for winning popular support and establishing credit is established, expressing a fresh start with the people, and earnestly rebuilding currency credibility, increasing currency value, thereby stabilizing prices, and securing people's livelihoods. Therefore, if remedies are not made quickly, it may be difficult to achieve the desired ideal effect.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The government is urgently implementing currency reform this time, and the financial authorities have repeatedly stated that in order to achieve the goals of stabilizing prices and securing people's livelihoods, and thus stabilizing currency values, it is possible to have a near-balanced budget of receipts and expenditures; and it is hoped that a near-balanced budget of receipts and expenditures will again stabilize currency values. This argument is theoretically not unreasonable. However, based on the current facts, the only way the government implements to stabilize prices is to freeze the prices at "August 19", and rigidly enforce price limits, without any other skills! This method was also promoted in the past during the Anti-Japanese War, from the capital Chongqing to major cities, and the result was from price limits to negotiated prices, and no success was ever seen. At present, in China's environment, there is probably not much difference in production and transportation compared to the past, and the basis of currency reform is only built on rigidly restricting prices and freezing them at the market prices of August 19. Assuming that the price limit policy is fortunately 100% successful, then in principle, it will be implemented after returning to the pre-war standard, and the state of price stability will be shaken.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to achieve a balance in government revenues and expenditures, the government is effectively rectifying tax sources, appropriately increasing existing taxes, and adjusting according to pre-war standards, in order to increase tax revenue. On the income side, it is estimated that the revenue will be 480 million in Gold Yuan for customs duties, 700 million for commodity taxes, 380 million for direct taxes, 320 million for salt taxes, and 200 million in total for other taxes and the surplus income from state-owned enterprises, etc. The sale of surplus materials and industry is approximately 400 million, totaling 2.46 billion; the expenditure is approximately 3.6 billion, and the budget deficit after offsetting revenue and expenditure is still short of 1.14 billion, accounting for approximately 30% of the expenditure, and more than 50% of the Gold Yuan issuance amount. It is planned to use US aid and issue Gold Yuan public debt to compensate for this shortfall, and the huge military expenditure has not yet been included. Looking at the income estimates, the direct taxes related to the social equalization policy only account for 300 million, and the rest are indirect taxes that can be passed on, which are all sufficient to affect prices. The spirit seems very contradictory, and it is not enough to match the economic policies of cutting with a broadax. The author believes that unless the government's estimate is a feint to the east and attack the west, and there is actually an international loan plan that can be used as a backing, otherwise this plan may not be able to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices and maintaining currency value to produce a reciprocal effect.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The purpose of economic reform is to reform the currency system, increase currency value, and stabilize prices, and then maintain currency value by stabilizing prices, which has a chain effect. The success of currency reform depends on whether prices are stable after the issuance of new currency. The highest authorities encouraged the people with "Only success is allowed, no failure is allowed," so it can be seen that the currency system and prices are complementary and interconnected. If prices can be stabilized, it will be the greatest success of the currency system. If the new currency system is successful, prices will be more stable, and its impact on the entire economic and political future is significant. The objective environment is like this, and the new currency system, which is congenitally deficient and born prematurely, is implemented with self-contradictory methods. So, how should we quickly find ways to improve technically, carry out remedies, and make postnatal adjustments? The author believes that attention should be paid to the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) Tax rectification should start with direct taxes with progressive high tax rates, and less adjustment of indirect taxes, so as to avoid increasing the burden on consumers and causing price instability, thereby affecting currency value. (For example, the universal increase of salt taxes and customs duties for convenience is the most unacceptable)</p>
<p>(2) Promote our country's virtue of frugality, learn from the effects of Hungary's efforts to save money after currency reform, and put it into practice. From top to bottom, create a spontaneous atmosphere of frugality. First, tighten; second, tighten; and third, still tighten. The following methods are described separately:</p>
<p>(A) Government personnel, starting from senior government officials, should tighten their belts as much as possible, save some of the materials they enjoy, especially exportable materials, in order to increase exports and earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(B) Government agencies should strive to tighten their belts, improve efficiency, and improve administrative organization. State-owned enterprises should strive to reduce expenditures and increase revenue, and under the principle of never adjusting prices, strive for self-sufficiency, maintain balance, and actively produce in order to enrich materials.</p>
<p>(C) Those in the upper class with leadership positions should promote frugality, set an example, establish a good style, eliminate banquets, automatically reduce food and clothing, and equalize living standards. Develop a frugal atmosphere from top to bottom, especially the large cities in the Beijing and Shanghai areas should be designated as demonstration areas. In a negative way, levy heavy luxury taxes according to progressive tax rates, in order to enrich the national treasury's income.</p>
<p>(3) Effectively implement the following three-balance policies, rectify taxes in order to increase revenue; vigorously practice economy to reduce expenditure. Then, in conjunction with the balance policy, control the relevant points and lines of the capital, in order to promote the strict control of economic policies. If the key points are grasped, the government authorities' financial policies will be implemented in an orderly manner, and the balance between revenue and expenditure can be gradually achieved.</p>
<p>(Zi) Balance financial revenue and expenditure:</p>
<p>A. Actively consolidate public debt, maintain credit, prepare to issue Gold Yuan public debt, enrich the national treasury, and absorb floating assets.</p>
<p>B. Rectify taxes, increase progressive direct taxes, strictly collect taxes, and implement equalization of wealth.</p>
<p>C. In order to win currency credibility and increase currency value, strictly limit issuance, and reduce the amount of issuance within the possible range according to the limited amount of Gold Yuan issuance.</p>
<p>(Chou) Balance international payments:</p>
<p>A. After the issuance of the new currency system, the increase in foreign exchange prices is sufficient to encourage exports, increase the number of exports, earn foreign exchange, and learn to achieve a surplus.</p>
<p>B. Restrict the import of non-essential goods, and in a gentle way, impose restrictions by imposing import taxes. The nature of the goods should be distinguished, and restrictions should be actively and passively imposed to prevent loopholes.</p>
<p>C. Weighing the needs of domestic light and heavy industry production raw materials, the government should differentiate between urgency, directly purchase and store as quickly as possible from foreign manufacturers and domestic producing areas, and equitably and averagely supply domestic factories for production and manufacturing needs.</p>
<p>(Yin) Balance the supply and demand of materials</p>
<p>A. Stabilize prices, and coordinate with comprehensive (national major cities, to be called comprehensive) economic controls, and fundamentally achieve price stability.</p>
<p>B. Inspect warehouses, reasonably handle, and thoroughly eliminate hoarding and speculation.</p>
<p>C. Reduce businesses and absolutely prohibit future illegal operations and off-site transactions.</p>
<p>D. Encourage floating assets to flow into legitimate channels and strengthen production work.</p>
<p>E. Effectively sell US-aid surplus goods to meet real needs.</p>
<p>F. Sell state-owned enterprises, the government should be sincere, and gradually sell all small units in separate small units.</p>
<p>G. Control daily necessities and implement a quota distribution system, so that those without purchase certificates are absolutely not allowed to purchase; at the same time, promote cooperation between production and sales to eliminate exploitation by middlemen.</p>
<p>H. Restrict consumption and levy heavy taxes on luxury goods and large consumers, imposing restrictions by imposing taxes. If the government can adopt the above-mentioned remedial measures and respond with the greatest determination, it is believed that maintaining it for three to six months will lay the foundation for currency value. Then prices can be stabilized, people's livelihoods can be roughly secured, and the balance between financial revenue and expenditure can be gradually achieved, and the new currency system can also be expected to be successful.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Officials Talk About the Reasons for Salt Tax Adjustment; Denies the Claim That Salt Administration Agencies Cannot Cover Expenditures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Recently, there have been many criticisms of the salt administration agencies. A reporter specifically interviewed relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) It is reported that the salt administration agencies' tax revenue does not cover expenditures, so the tax rate was adjusted, resulting in higher salt prices and increased burden on the people. What is the actual situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) The increase in the salt tax collection rate this time is purely for balancing the national treasury revenue and expenditure, so as to facilitate the implementation of currency reform. According to the new tax rate calculation, the annual salt tax revenue is approximately 300 million in Gold Yuan, which is all transferred to the national treasury in accordance with the Public Treasury Law, and the salt administration agencies cannot arbitrarily use it. As for the expenses of the salt administration agencies, in the first half of this year, when the food salt tax rate was 450,000 legal tender per dan, and the half-year revenue was more than 8.8 trillion legal tender, the expenses for the management part were more than 800 billion legal tender, accounting for approximately 9% of the tax revenue, and the expenses for the tax police part were more than 1 trillion legal tender, accounting for approximately 14% of the tax revenue. After the tax change this time, the salt tax revenue budget for the second half of this year is more than 100 million in Gold Yuan (of which July and August were calculated at the old tax rate converted into Gold Yuan). The management part's expenses budget for the same period is more than 5.4 million Gold Yuan, accounting for approximately 5%, and the tax police part's expenses budget is approximately 10 million Gold Yuan, accounting for slightly more than 10%.</p>
<p>(Question) It is reported that the salt administration agencies have nearly 100,000 administrative personnel, and the organization is huge. Is this true?</p>
<p>(Answer) Combining all levels of salt administration agencies nationwide, there are currently 960 units, with a total of 13,269 officials and laborers, far from the rumored 100,000 people. Looking back at the period when the salt monopoly was implemented during the war, the area was smaller than it is now, and the salt administration agencies had reached 1,567 units, with 28,231 workers. Even after the restoration in 1946, the salt administration agencies still had 1,408 units, with 15,339 employees. It can be seen that they are gradually being reduced. The current need for such a large number of agencies and personnel is actually due to the unrest in the region, and the difficulty of both production and transportation. It is necessary to strictly manage the region so that supply and demand correspond, and salt prices are stable. Once the suppression and construction are completed, the salt administration personnel can be concentrated in the mining areas, and reductions can be made as much as possible.</p>
<p>(Question) The salt tax rate has been changed to 8 Gold Yuan per dan. From the perspective of the average pre-war tax rate, is it too high?</p>
<p>(Answer) The pre-war standard that is generally referred to now mostly refers to the first half of 1937. At that time, the national salt tax rate averaged 6 national currency yuan per city dan (equivalent to 12 Gold Yuan), so the current rate of 8 Gold Yuan per city dan is actually only two-thirds of the pre-war average rate. Moreover, this 8 yuan tax rate is only levied on sea salt and pond salt. The tax rate for well salt, earth salt, and gypsum salt produced in the interior is only 5 yuan and 6 jiao per city dan, so the national average tax rate is still less than 8 yuan. Also, each person consumes at most 1 city jin of salt per month, and the salt tax burden is at most 8 fen in Gold Yuan, which does not seem heavy.</p>

<h3>Economic Control of Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei Enters Fundamental Stage; Beiping Municipal Government Orders Manufacturers to Register Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Economic control of Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei has entered a fundamental stage. To address the food supply problem, surplus deposits from banks will be used to provide low-interest loans to grain merchants for purchases from rural areas. The government will guarantee their legal profits and, when necessary, purchase and directly distribute the grain. This simultaneously resolves the difficulty of banks having more deposits than loans. It is tentatively decided that the National Bank will provide three-fifths of the loans, and other banks will provide two-fifths. Taking Beiping as an example, the initial goal is to procure 60 million catties, the monthly consumption for the city's two million residents, with each person consuming an average of one catty per day. The Hebei Provincial Government will be requested to assist. Wen Chongxin, Director of the Beiping Social Affairs Bureau, and Yao Zihe, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, have been summoned by Zhang Lisheng to take the plan to Tianjin tomorrow morning and report on the reactions following the major inspection in Beiping. Various inspection teams will go to the suburbs tomorrow to investigate the sources of grain and meat. The Beiping Municipal Government decided at an economic meeting this afternoon to order all manufacturers to register raw materials exceeding three months' consumption. Retail daily necessities must be stamped by the relevant trade association, indicating the price limit. Merchants have requested the establishment of a price protection committee, which is still pending approval from the central government. However, price negotiation has already begun.</p>

<h3>Vyshinsky Repeats Old Tune; Condemns U.S. Preparations for War Against the Soviet Union; Advocates Disarmament and Prohibition of Atomic Weapons</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky today bluntly accused the United States of planning to wage war against the Soviet Union. On the third day of the general debate at the United Nations General Assembly, Vyshinsky launched the most serious attack in the history of the United Nations against any country, saying that one major power is paying attention to planning for war against another country. Vyshinsky specifically urged the United Nations to recommend that the five powers "reduce their existing naval, land, and air forces by one-third within one year" and prohibit atomic weapons. He reiterated the old cliché that the United States is promoting Western military blocs and supporting West Germany in order to launch another war. Vyshinsky also greatly criticized the Marshall Plan, saying that "all actions of the United States are simultaneously making various military preparations, frantically rearming, and planning to attack the Soviet Union and new democratic countries." The Soviet Union loves peace, but the United States' preparations for war against the Soviet Union are based on atomic warfare. He claimed that the recent changes in U.S. foreign policy have been extremely drastic, shifting from peaceful diplomacy to a "policy of expanding territory and dominating the world." Before Vyshinsky's speech, the Soviet side predicted that his words would be like a "bomb," but they had no effect. His motions are as follows: (1) The five powers "should reduce their existing naval, land, and air forces by one-third within one year in order to achieve disarmament." (2) Determine that atomic weapons are weapons of aggression rather than national defense and must be prohibited. (3) "Establish an international control bureau within the Security Council mechanism to monitor and manage the implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons." (Note: The Soviet Union has veto power in the Security Council). Vyshinsky's motives greatly surprised Western countries, and his failure to mention the Berlin crisis was also surprising. Many people thought that Vyshinsky would demand the early withdrawal of the occupying forces of the four powers in Germany, but he never mentioned the German issue.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky claimed that the United States' goal for atomic energy policy within the United Nations is to enable the United States to produce atomic bombs without restriction in the future. He briefly described U.S. foreign policy as follows: "Openly supporting the most reactionary imperial and fascist regimes or groups in certain countries, systematically providing them with money and military equipment to resist the democratic and liberation movements in those countries, organizing military alliances or blocs, building new naval, land, and air bases, and expanding and rebuilding old bases established during the war based on the latest military technical needs, endlessly promoting war against the Soviet Union and Eastern European democratic countries, crazily preparing for war, worshiping the atomic bomb, and believing that this can escape the crises facing the capitalist world; these are the characteristics of the current U.S. foreign policy. As for the Soviet Union, it continues to adopt a peaceful policy." As soon as Vyshinsky finished his speech, applause erupted in the audience, but there was only one instance of applause interrupting his speech during the 25-minute speech. Vyshinsky was the speaker who received the warmest applause from the audience at this session of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] U.S. Representative Austin criticized Vyshinsky's speech on the 25th as "clichéd." Regarding the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal, Austin said, "This is a reiteration of the Soviet Union's proposals from past meetings." French Foreign Minister Schumann said that Vyshinsky's speech was "not only interesting but simply sensational." He said that the General Assembly should launch technical discussions as soon as possible based on Vyshinsky's disarmament proposals. Schumann also said that the discussions could produce many useful results.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Passes Agenda; Soviet Proposal Vetoed by Overwhelming Majority</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] The issue of Korean independence, which Foreign Minister Wang actively advocated in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly this morning, was retained by a vote of 47 (including China) to 7, despite the Soviet Union's proposal to submit a motion to the General Assembly, and the Soviet Union's proposal failed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly on the 24th rejected the Soviet Union's attempt to remove seven issues from the agenda. All but one of these seven issues are directly or indirectly related to the Soviet Union's diplomatic actions, and most of them are closely related to the Cold War between East and West. The General Assembly voted to include the 68 issues approved by the Joint Committee on the agenda. Soviet Representative Malik "insisted" on removing these seven issues, but the Soviet Union and its satellite countries were defeated by overwhelming majorities in seven votes. The seven issues opposed by Malik and the votes were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of admitting seven countries, including Italy, to the United Nations was passed by a vote of 29 to 16 with 10 abstentions. (2) The Greek issue was passed by a vote of 44 to 6. (3) The Korean issue was passed by a vote of 47 to 6. (4) The issue of amending the veto power of the five powers was passed by a vote of 47 to 6. (5) The issue of extending the "Small General Assembly" was passed by a vote of 46 to 6. (6) The issue of long-term international cooperation was passed by a vote of 47 to 6. (7) The immigration case of Soviet wives of foreign diplomatic personnel was passed by a vote of 30 to 7. The issue of the abuse of Indians in South Africa will continue to be considered by the Joint Committee. In addition, the General Assembly also passed six issues proposed by the Soviet bloc for inclusion on the agenda, which were not opposed by the United States and other Western countries. Soviet Representative Malik said that the Western bloc's insistence on discussing issues such as Greece and Korea is an attempt to destroy the United Nations.</p>

<h3>Bulgaria Applies to Join the United Nations; The United States Reiterates Its Opposition</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 24th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie received a telegram from Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov, reiterating Bulgaria's request to join the United Nations.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 24th] The U.S. State Department sent a memorandum to Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov, refuting his claim that the United States opposed Bulgaria's entry into the United Nations. The U.S. said that according to the U.S., the Bulgarian government is now placing its people in slave labor camps, prisons, torture, and death, so the U.S. government believes that Bulgaria has not fulfilled the qualities stated in the treaty and cannot join the United Nations as a member.</p>
<h3>UN Budget Surplus; Lie Submits Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie reported to the first meeting of the General Assembly's Budgetary Administrative Committee on the 25th that there should be a large surplus in the 1948 budget. He said that the savings could be "used to offset expenditures for unforeseen matters in the 1948 budget." The chairman of the committee is Canada's Bruce, who also elected Ukraine's Jagan on the 25th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] It is reported that the United States will ask the General Assembly to set a maximum limit on the costs of the United Nations and make a "symbolic reduction" in the amount that the United States will bear in the next year. According to the UN budget officials, the United States will still bear 39.89% of the UN's annual expenditure, estimated by Secretary-General Lie to be $33,469,000, which is $1,355,000 less than the amount paid by the United States this year. The U.S. delegation also agreed that the U.S. should bear the maximum amount of UN expenses until the economic situation in other parts of the world improves, but demanded that the amount be "symbolically reduced" so that the burden of any member state of the United Nations does not exceed one-third of the UN's annual expenses.</p>
<h3>Soviet Aircraft Formation Flies Over Berlin; US Lodges Serious Protest; Live Anti-Aircraft Artillery Drills Not Conducted</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Union blatantly tore up the Four-Power aviation safety regulations on the 25th, directly informing the British and Americans that Soviet military aircraft would fly in formation over the Berlin occupation zones. This was the second such act in two days, apparently intended to threaten the Western airlift. On the 24th, Soviet anti-aircraft guns fired at fighter planes at the end of one of the three air corridors. The United States has lodged a serious written protest against the formation flights.</p>
<p>The Soviet note stated that Soviet aircraft would operate along visual routes. A US military officer said that this statement included everything from above 1,000 feet. "As long as the weather is clear and we can see the planes, there is no danger, but formation flying is a direct violation of the aviation safety agreement. The Soviet Union deliberately disregards and denies all Four-Power recognized aviation regulations that the Soviet side signed.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 24th] On the 24th, the Soviet side issued a notice stating that it would conduct anti-aircraft artillery drills along the Berlin air corridors. However, no drills took place at that time, and officials did not pay attention to the warning, regarding it as Soviet psychological warfare. The Soviet authorities informed the British that the Soviet Union would conduct live anti-aircraft artillery drills near the Buckeburg air corridor, which connects the British occupation zone with Berlin, at 6:00 AM standard time. The American side is also currently using this corridor.</p>

<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the US, Panyushkin, Suggests: Increase Japan's Peacetime Industry; Supervised by Strong Nations to Prevent the Revival of War Potential</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The Soviet Embassy in the US announced on the 24th that the Soviet Union has suggested that Japan's industry could be revived without restrictions for "several years" under the control of various strong nations in order to prevent Japan from building a new military structure. This suggestion was made in the Far Eastern Commission on the 23rd. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin stated the Soviet Union's position: "If Japan is not allowed to revive its war industry and militarism, then the increase in Japan's industrial development itself is not a cause for concern."</p>
<p>Panyushkin continued, stating that according to the Soviet suggestion, Japan's industrial development "will expand the possibility of Japanese exports, will help strengthen Japan's economic independence, and will reduce the degree to which Japan's national finances depend on foreign factors." The supervision of Japan's industrial recovery "should be carried out by nations that are most concerned with preventing Japan from launching new aggression." This supervisory organization should be "included in the peace treaty with Japan." Panyushkin also stated that at the beginning, it must be decided what kind of industry should be developed in order to prevent the revival of war potential. But "it must be remembered that Japan must satisfy the legitimate compensation demands of the nations that suffered from Japanese aggression. The Soviet government believes there is no reason to limit Japan's future industry. Japan's industry should have as its sole purpose satisfying the peacetime needs of the Japanese people. If we proceed from this single correct basis, then the soundness of the demand to limit Japan's peacetime industrial development will be self-evident."</p>
<h3>Stalin Personally Presides Over Meeting of Top Eastern European Leaders; A Joint Declaration May Be Issued After the Meeting</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 24th] Well-informed Romanian sources confirm that Stalin recently held a meeting in Crimea with Czech President Gottwald, Romanian Foreign Minister Mrs. Pauker, and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] It is generally believed here that the secret meeting of Eastern European government leaders currently taking place somewhere in Crimea was convened by Stalin. The Soviet bloc may be indicating to the Western powers that the bloc can also unite when necessary. It is expected that the meeting may issue a joint statement on the Berlin issue. It is reported that the political situation in Eastern European countries is not stable, and the Soviet Union may want to ensure complete control in the event of an international crisis. The Soviet Union will also consider some form of economic aid to match the Western European countries receiving Marshall Aid.</p>
<h3>Panyushkin's Suggestion Seems to Be for Concluding a Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>US and Eastern US Officials Are Deeply Surprised</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] US officials were deeply surprised on the 25th by the Soviet proposal to unconditionally restore Japanese industry. One senior official said: "If such a proposal is sincere," then the US side would welcome it, but many parties maintain a cautious attitude. Soviet Ambassador to the US Panyushkin made this suggestion during the Far Eastern Commission meeting on the 23rd. The general feeling is undoubtedly one of excitement about the Soviet suggestion. One US official pointed out: "This suggestion will get closer to the practical question," he said: This practical question is concluding a peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet attitude expressed by Panyushkin is at least more encouraging than in the past. The Soviet statement indicates that the Soviet Union supports an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, which the United States has long called for and China also supports.</p>

<h3>France Brewing New Labor Strike; Insisting on the Original Demand for Wage Increases</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] French Prime Minister Queuille had to abandon his plan to deliver a national broadcast speech on the evening of the 24th, calling for an end to the labor strike, because the radio station was on strike.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] A new labor strike broke out in France on the evening of the 24th, plunging Queuille's new cabinet into a dangerous situation. It is estimated that 5 million workers will hold a two-hour general strike on the 24th, indicating a warning from organized labor with enormous power in a showdown. At the same time, miners and heavy industry workers are also threatening to launch a general strike to paralyze the country's industry.</p>
<p>This strike occurred after the government decided to increase wages by 15% to appease the labor unions. Communist and non-Communist labor unions, threatening strikes, demanded wage increases to cope with rising living costs, with each labor union demanding a 33% pay raise. Queuille initially raised wages by 10% and claimed that exceeding this amount would cause inflation. On the evening of the 24th, Queuille made further concessions, agreeing to raise wages to 15%, but the labor unions remained dissatisfied.</p>

<h3>Analysis of Burma's National Policy</h3>
<p>— Xu Siren</p>
<p>Burma's national policy after independence is indeed puzzling. Based on the fifteen-point leftist political program announced by Prime Minister Thakin Nu on May 26th of this year, it can be said to be extremely left-leaning. The content advocates: immediately establishing political and economic ties with the Soviet Union, confiscating the enterprises of major companies, confiscating the land of major landlords, carrying out social revolution, etc. However, Foreign Minister U Tin Tut (Editor's note: U was seriously injured by a bomb attack on September 18th and died) repeatedly stated when clarifying Burma's national policy that Burma's national policy has absolutely no communist tendencies. The reason why Burma's national policy is so erratic is, on the one hand, to adapt to the international environment, and on the other hand, it can be said to be due to the lack of coordination among the personnel within the current provisional government. Because the ruling party, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, is a combination of various parties, and its members are extremely complex. The leaders of the various parties each have their own thoughts and beliefs, and therefore each has their own主張. Simply put, the current provisional government can be divided into three factions: pro-British, neutral, and pro-Marxist-Leninist. U Tin Tut and others are pro-British, Thakin Nu is neutral, and the young members of the Socialist Party are pro-Marxist-Leninist. The Socialist Party members also have different dreams from the Burmese communists and are incompatible with each other. Because of these complex reasons, a complex national policy has emerged. After independence, in order to replenish the sick body that had suffered more than sixty years of exploitation, the provisional government put forward a grand goal of reviving the people's livelihood. Because Burma is an agricultural country, reviving the people's livelihood naturally requires reforming the land policy. Therefore, all political parties have "land to the tiller" as a prerequisite for their party's doctrine. In order to adapt to this objective environment, the provisional government, despite its complex members, cannot but choose the path of socialism. According to Articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement, British enterprises in Burma still retain special privileges. (Article 7 of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement: (A) All contracts entered into by Burma with British subjects and British commercial firms before the implementation of the Burmese Union Constitution shall continue to be valid, and the Burmese government shall be liable for all obligations under such contracts. (B) All property and interests owned by British subjects or authorities before the implementation of the Burmese Union Constitution, or their contracts with Burma, shall continue to exist and be valid; the Burmese provisional government or any successor government shall recognize such property rights, etc. Article 8: The governments of the United Kingdom and Burma have decided to sign commercial and navigation treaties satisfactory to both parties as soon as possible. Before such regulations are established for two years, all current business or occupations and their interests of British subjects shall remain as before.) This time, the Burmese provisional government, on the one hand, to avoid giving the Burmese communists a pretext for attack, and on the other hand, to nationalize enterprises to assist in the realization of people's livelihood, resolutely nationalized major British enterprises in Burma, such as the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, and promulgated regulations that foreigners in Burma could not transfer or mortgage real estate, and that all land would be nationalized. All of these actions by the Burmese provisional government appear to be heading towards the road of communism. Coupled with Thakin Nu's anti-British and pro-Soviet speech on June 9th, and the above-mentioned leftist alliance political program, it is even more perceived that Burma is already implementing red policies. Thakin Nu publicly declared at the mass meeting on June 9th that, no matter what, the government would do its best to implement the recently drafted leftist alliance political program. If the Anglo-Burmese Agreement hindered the leftist political program, we would rather abandon the agreement and preserve the political program; if we had the strength, we could even declare war on Britain. However, if you simply use these things to infer Burma's national policy, then you are wrong, because equally many facts show that Burma is not leaning left, and Thakin Nu's leftist alliance political program is nothing more than empty talk. After Thakin Nu made pro-Soviet remarks, Foreign Minister U Tin Tut immediately followed with a solemn statement, saying that Burma's national policy absolutely does not tend to communism, and at the same time repeatedly assured that Burma's foreign policy would not change in the slightest, and that Burma would always abide by the spirit of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement. Other facts, such as U Tin Tut's resignation from the post of Foreign Minister, joining the army to suppress the communists, and the government's irreconcilable position with the Burmese communists, can all serve as clear evidence that Burma does not want to lean left. Having talked about the problem here, the reporter might as well analyze Burma's contradictory national policy. As mentioned above, the personnel within the Burmese provisional government are divided into three factions. Socialist Party members do intend to make Burma red, but they cannot cooperate with the Burmese communists due to issues of power. Therefore, although the doctrine is communism, they are in fact anti-communist. Socialist Party members, on the one hand, implement their own doctrine, and on the other hand, adapt to the environment and compete with the Burmese communists. Therefore, these people have done things that make people feel that Burma is implementing red policies. Thakin Nu is a neutral figure and should not have agreed with these people. The reason why Thakin Nu agreed, according to the reporter's personal observation, is quite worthy of sympathy. Burma needs construction after independence. Burma, which has no economic foundation, must rely on the assistance of Britain and the United States to engage in construction. The intelligent Thakin Nu will not fail to understand this key decision. However, it is impossible to cope with the current situation without uniting the Freedom League, especially since the Burmese communists are using the opportunity of the bankruptcy of the rural areas in Burma after the war to entice farmers with the utopian sweet taste of the public system. Ba Maw and other opposition parties are also eyeing the throne covetously. The above-mentioned pro-socialist party members also have the power to influence the government in the provisional government. Under the principle of "first secure the domestic front and then resist foreign aggression," Thakin Nu had to compromise, and his difficulties were well understood by the people of the country.</p>
<p>As for Foreign Minister U Tin Tut, who was called "British-run" by the Burmese communists, felt that he was in a difficult situation, so he resolutely decided to resign. Communism is the mortal enemy of those who are currently following the British and American route. Although some members of the Socialist Party are also following the "muddy road," the stakes for these people can be said to be much lighter than for the Burmese communists, not to mention that they are considered to be their own people. Therefore, U Tin Tut shifted the target of struggle to the Burmese communists. After resigning as Foreign Minister, he immediately transferred to the military and personally went to the front line to command the suppression of the communists. Although U's transfer to the military was opposed by some (including Socialist Party members), it was approved by Thakin Nu without any setbacks, and he was granted the rank of colonel. From this point, it can be seen that the pro-British faction is not completely without a foothold in the government. Later, U Tin Tut and his wife flew to London, and still issued a statement in the name of Foreign Minister, saying, "Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu and the Burmese government have decided to take constitutional means to safeguard the recently gained independence. We believe that any threat to the implementation of the constitution—such as the current actions of the Burmese communists—we will do our best to crush it. The Burmese army and police are now shouldering this important task. They are extremely loyal to the government, and with the support of the Burmese government and most people, the government will be able to quell the Burmese communists and restore security and order in a short period of time without any difficulty. Burma's policy is to maintain the friendship of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the democratic countries of Western Europe, while developing its political and economic scope. Therefore, Burma also intends to establish relations with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. The Union of Burma does not oppose communism, but the current government has no intention of implementing communism. As for the promotion of communism, that is entirely the matter of the Burmese communists and has nothing to do with the current government. The Burmese government is determined to faithfully implement the Anglo-Burmese Agreement." Is Burma's national policy really like what U Tin Tut said? Although this is still questionable, the reporter dares to say for sure that U Tin Tut's national policy declaration is fair. (Sent from Rangoon on August 30th)</p>

<h3>Thirty-Six Professional Students; Special Criminal Court Begins Investigation; Decision on Indictment to Be Made at the End of the Month; No Bail Allowed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to implement the government's orders and eliminate communist spies from schools, the Special Criminal Court arrested 86 college and middle school students suspected of being "professional students" from August 27th onwards and detained them at the Penglai Police Station. Yesterday, the court began its formal investigation. The first batch of 36 people were brought in for questioning yesterday afternoon. The list is as follows: Wang Zongyi, Cai Zuhua, Yang Menglan, Hua Guang, Sun Baoying, Chen Yuming, Jiang Yiqing (all from Nantong College), Ren Minjian, Tao Zengyue, Chen Mingde, Huang Rujian, Yin Minzhi (all from Shanghai Law School), Hu Chengen, Shan Daqi, Yu Weijian (all from Datong University), Wen Yin, Wu Yinhua, Gao Gushen (all from Southeast Medical College), Shen Jie, Chen Minggui (all from New China College of Commerce and Law), Wu Kun, Cheng Wenhu (all from Zhendan University), Sun Mingzhen, Xu Linzheng (both from Shanghai Medical College), Ye Jinru, Huang Lisha (both from Jinan University), Xu Yuanjun (Shanghai Business School), Duan Ze (Tongji University), Zhang Lijuan (Music Academy), Yuan Zhenzhong (Municipal Normal College), Lu Guojun (Assistant Teacher, Advanced Mechanical School), Bao Qichou (St. John's University), Yang Guichang (Fudan University), Zhou Xingxing (Guanghua University), Shen Guifang (China Industrial and Commercial Vocational School), Song Henian (Hua Shi Middle School). The case was investigated separately by prosecutors Zhu Cheng and Li Yulong yesterday.

<h3>Strengthening the Communication between Economic Control Agencies in Various Regions; Yu Hongjun Goes to Beijing to Submit Specific Measures; Finished Product Prices Can Be Adjusted If There Is a Reason</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Shanghai Regional Supervisor Yu Hongjun took the night train to Beijing yesterday and will submit specific measures to the central government to strengthen the communication between economic control agencies in Shanghai and other regions. Yesterday, the Supervisor's Office released a review of its work over the past week, stating that the prices of goods in the city have been maintained at the "August 19th" levels, and the prices of many daily necessities are even below the price limits. In order to achieve long-term price stability, the production conditions and raw material stocks of factories are currently being investigated, and plans are being made to increase production. In addition, Supervisor Jiang met with the responsible persons of various factories to exchange opinions. The focus of the talks was the issue of raw materials. Factories that purchase raw materials from outside the country are allowed to import them, and imported raw materials are allowed to be freely supplied to the market after reporting. Domestic raw materials will be purchased from the place of origin by the Central Bank in conjunction with various industry associations, and part of the funds can be advanced by the Central Bank. Because the prices of raw materials from other places are high, which may affect manufacturing costs, if there are legitimate reasons and facts, the prices of finished products can be appropriately adjusted without affecting the overall price limit situation. In addition, some factories are currently experiencing reductions in working hours and shutdowns. The reason for this is not the lack of raw materials, but the unreasonable distribution of raw materials. For example, the knitting industry has reduced production because it cannot obtain fine yarn. Some of these problems have been resolved, and unified measures are being drafted. The office is currently handling the crackdown on hoarding and inventory registration and hopes that the industrial and commercial sectors can cooperate. In order to increase production, it is strictly stipulated that workers must not strike or slack off, and employers must not close factories or dismiss workers.</p>

<h3>Vice President Visits Various Factories</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Vice President Li, accompanied by Zhao Zengjue, Zai Zhuyi, and others, visited the No. 17 Factory of the China Textile Construction Company, the No. 4 Wool Spinning Factory, and the company's workers' children's school. They were personally guided by Wu Weijing, the deputy general manager of the company. Li had lunch at the No. 17 Factory and, after the meal, addressed all the employees of the company, mainly focusing on three points: (1) China's history and culture are more ancient than those of other countries, but the reason why we are still behind others is due to the backwardness of industry. I sincerely hope that everyone will work hard to catch up. (2) All major national affairs cannot be solved solely through politics but must also start with the establishment of industry and agriculture. Once clothing and food are resolved, most problems will also be resolved, but this still requires everyone's efforts.

I hope that after the raw cotton material problem can be solved, the raw wool material can also achieve self-sufficiency.</p>

<h3>Poor People Don't Eat Broken Rice, People's Survey Council Admits Plan Was Broken</h3>
<p>According to the People's Survey Council: The recent shortage of rationed rice in some areas of the city was caused by human factors. After the authorities decided in early September that the poor could purchase broken rice at half price, the People's Survey Council distributed 100,000 dan of broken rice, based on a calculation of one million poor people in each district. However, some poor people voluntarily gave up receiving the poor people's rice and still purchased whole rice from rice shops. As of the 17th of this month, only more than 15,000 dan of broken rice had been sold, while more than 80,000 dan of whole rice had been sold, breaking the council's planned distribution.

<h3>General Manager of New Jianrong Trading Company's Residence Found to Contain Large Quantities of Wool Yarn, Family Moved to Hong Kong, Goods Sealed, Deputy Manager Summoned to Explain the Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At 10:00 AM on the 23rd, the Changshu District Police Department received a tip that a large quantity of wool yarn and wool underwear was hoarded in Room 201, No. 1, Lane 345, Yongjia Road. The section chief ordered Zeng Peide, a section member in charge, to lead personnel to investigate. It was learned that the residence belonged to Zheng Guang, a citizen who was the General Manager of New Jianrong Import and Export Company located at Room B-11, No. 11 Nanjing Road. The family had recently moved to Hong Kong, and the company's affairs were temporarily managed by the Deputy Manager, Zeng Cheng. The residence was only left with an employee, Ye Ruikun, to guard it. The police officers saw that the rooms on the second floor were locked, so they, together with the local Bao chief and the guard Ye Ruikun, opened them one by one. In one of the rooms, they found 3,000 pounds of coarse wool yarn, 200 dozen wool underwear, and four packages of wool sweater material. The room was sealed, and a staff member was sent to New Jianrong Trading Company to summon the Deputy Manager, Zeng Cheng. According to Zeng, New Jianrong Trading Company was solely owned by General Manager Zheng Guang. He had only started working at the company in August 1947. The materials in question were imported before he joined the company. The wool underwear material was imported at the end of October 1946, weighing a total of 7,771 pounds. In 1947, General Manager Zheng Guang handled the material and had a manufacturer knit several hundred dozen wool underwear. A portion was sold, and the rest was stored in the Yongjia Road residence. The coarse wool yarn was imported in mid-June 1947, weighing a total of 4,988 pounds. Except for 1,100 pounds that were sold, the rest was moved out of the warehouse six months ago and stored at home to save on warehouse rent and insurance fees. After investigation, Zeng Cheng and Ye Ruikun seemed to have nothing to do with the case and were released on bail. The goods stored in the residence had not been sold for years, suggesting that they were hoarded for speculation. They were sealed and reported to the authorities for handling.</p>
<h3>Hawker Raises Prices and Bribes, Referred to Prosecutor's Office for Prosecution</h3>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Industrial Representatives to Discuss Ways to Resolve Raw Material Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened more than 20 industrial representatives, including Hu Xiyuan, Hong Nianzu, Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, and Cai Xintao, yesterday morning to discuss ways to resolve the current raw material problems facing various factories. The attendees presented many difficulties, and the following points were agreed upon: (1) The ongoing registration of raw materials for factories is difficult because many industrial products require dozens of raw materials. If each one needs to be registered, it will be extremely difficult. Therefore, the registration will be limited to important raw materials, and other subsidiary raw materials will not need to be registered. (2) Each industry should list the names of the raw materials it needs, estimate how much is needed in three months, how much is currently in stock, and how much is still lacking, and report the quantities to the Social Affairs Bureau. (3) Measures to solve the shortage of raw materials: (a) If the raw materials have already been purchased and stored outside Shanghai but cannot be transported to Shanghai, they can be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating their current location. The authorities will be responsible for sending a telegram to the local government to provide proof and find a way to transport them out. (b) If the raw materials have not yet been purchased from outside, they can inform the government where they can be purchased, and the government will provide a certificate to allow them to purchase the materials and ask the local government to assist in facilitating the purchase. (c) If the raw materials are available from Shanghai merchants but they are hoarding them and unwilling to sell, they only need to inform the government. The government is currently handling inventory registration. If it is found that they do have the raw materials, they will be ordered to sell them. (d) If the raw materials are lacking in the country and must be purchased from abroad, they can report to the Social Affairs Bureau and request the assistance of the Materials Adjustment Committee in procuring them.</p>
<h3>A New Force is Generated: The Youth Service Corps is Established, Ready for a Life-or-Death Struggle with Corrupt Merchants and Officials</h3>

He continued, "The Youth Service Corps is the leader's revolutionary dare-to-die team. We can tell the President with relief that his loyal followers have been organized, and a new force has grown. We are determined to dedicate everything to the country, the people, and the leader, and strive to eliminate and suppress the Communist Party, which is an evil group, as well as the corrupt merchants and officials, who are a corrupt group."

<p>Jiang Jingguo Encourages Members: Do Not Be Arrogant, Do Not Be Discouraged, Do Not Compromise</p>
<p>Supervisor Jiang began by saying: "The establishment of the Youth Service Corps demonstrates the emergence of a new force in Shanghai. I hope that the youth will create a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, seek national survival, national unity, and rescue the people from suffering." He then encouraged the members to maintain a clean and upright character, not to be arrogant or discouraged, never to compromise halfway, and to have the spirit of great compassion and great kindness to relieve suffering and rescue those in need, as well as the spirit of loyalty to the country. Jiang pointed out that Shanghai is a society where people eat people, where "there is reason if there are gold bars," and the poor and suffering are abandoned. Now that the autumn wind has risen, he hoped that the members would not only assist the government in eliminating corrupt merchants, but also engage in practical work, launching a large-scale winter relief campaign to save the poor, help needy students, and seek stability for Shanghai. Finally, Jiang shouted "Long live the Shanghai Youth, long live, long live, long live!"

<h3>Reviewing the Municipal Government's Policy Report: The Participating Group Makes Final Revisions, Guiding Idle Capital to Build Houses, Actively Solving the Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>In order to review the policy report submitted by the Municipal Government at the seventh general meeting of the Municipal Council, the "Policy Report Review Committee" was previously designated by the conveners of various groups. After preliminary discussions and opinions on the city's administrative facilities, Chairman Zhao Yangxiong held another meeting yesterday afternoon to make final revisions to the proposed policy report opinions, which will be sent to the municipal government for handling. In yesterday's group meeting, the emphasis was still placed on adopting the principle of focusing on municipal facilities in this city, gradually clarifying the current situation, and when business expenses are not sufficient, it is especially necessary to reduce personnel and avoid extravagance, so as not to waste the sweat and blood of the citizens. The most important revision in yesterday's meeting was the housing rental issue in the land administration section. This section also stated in the original draft opinion: "The housing shortage in this city is the most serious in the country. Even if the central government intends to formulate a unified rent method and implement it nationwide, it is difficult to predict whether it can be integrated. At present, the monetary system has been reformed, and the issue of rent adjustment is attracting the attention of the entire society. Municipal authorities should continue to study how to make it reasonable." However, most of the review committee members present still believed that the words "continue to study" might be used as an excuse to increase rents, which would have a significant impact on the livelihood of citizens. Finally, it was unanimously decided to delete this section in its entirety, and the Land Administration Bureau was asked to pay attention to guiding idle capital to build houses, and effectively promote how to open up real estate mortgages so that real estate can implement currency funds and actively solve the housing shortage.</p>
<p>In addition, the group advocated: (1) Autonomous administration: sound mediation institutions should be established, household registration administration should be unified, and the work of the self-defense force and conscription should be accelerated. (2) Police administration: in addition to strengthening the investigation and arrest of bandits, strictly prohibiting evil parties, and appeasing refugees, it is also necessary to strengthen traffic management and enrich traffic equipment. (3) Social affairs: we should earnestly and strictly control rice prices, dredge sources, and absolutely not exceed the limited price. At the same time, we should comprehensively plan and promote the entire relief undertaking, and ask the Civil Affairs Commission to appropriately relax the quantity of rice distribution to the poor. (4) Finance: we should pay more attention to the integrity of tax officials to eliminate embezzlement and enrich tax revenue. In addition to reorganizing reasonable and good tax sources, we must also try our best to save unnecessary expenses. (5) Public works: the maintenance of major roads should still be funded extensively and the repair work should be carried out. Together with the flood prevention committee, the drainage project should be promoted to solve the road water problem. (6) Public utilities: we sincerely hope to buy time, quickly solve the problem of drinking water for citizens in Shanghai West and Pudong, and urge various power companies to strengthen contact and find ways to improve power supply efficiency. At the same time, we sincerely hope to promote the formal establishment of the public transportation company within this year in accordance with the resolution of the conference to promote the development of public transportation. (7) Education: In addition to hoping to continue to add national schools to meet actual needs, we must also strengthen the equipment of municipal primary and secondary schools, and pay special attention to adding vocational schools. (8) Hygiene: we should strengthen epidemic prevention and health facilities, and order a large number of B.C.G. medical products to expand the anti-tuberculosis campaign.</p>
<p>Researching Local Autonomy Regulations: Three Supplementary Items are Decided</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Local Autonomy Law Research Committee also convened a meeting yesterday, chaired by Tong Xingbai. During the meeting, the seventh item of the seventh conference, submitted by the speaker, was discussed: When the Legislative Yuan is currently deliberating on the local autonomy regulations, the council should provide opinions and ask for adoption. After careful research, it was decided to supplement three opinions, as follows: 1. The provincial and county councils have the right to propose the removal of the provincial and county chiefs, which should be included in the election and recall law. 2. Items 29 and 46 of the Legislative Yuan's draft provincial and county autonomy regulations, in addition to the original plan for items 1, 2, and 3, the reasons listed in item 4 should be approved by the provincial and county councils. 3. The number of directly-controlled municipal councilors elected from the region shall be at least fifty. If the population exceeds one million, one councilor shall be added for every additional 50,000 people. The number of councilors elected from professional groups shall not exceed one-third of the councilors elected from the region. The number of women's groups shall be determined separately. The above three items are incorporated into the seventh item of the seventh message and sent to the Legislative Yuan for adoption. The speaker is also asked to arrange for local legislators to be received, and to urge them to work together to strive for the Legislative Yuan.</p>

<h3>Fragrant Osmanthus Fills Nanshan: Manjuelong is Filled with Autumn Colors and Flavors</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 24th] Osmanthus trees are found everywhere in China, but Hangzhou probably has the most. In the Jin Dynasty, there was a Manjuelong in Hangzhou, where many osmanthus trees were planted. At that time, many scholars in the Manjue Temple also gathered there in autumn. Later, the osmanthus trees were cultivated more and more each year. When people in Hangzhou get married, they all make osmanthus candy to give to guests, which is still the case today. This is because the osmanthus season coincides with the full moon and fragrant flowers, taking the meaning of sweetness and harmony. The Manjue Temple area has been expanded into the Manjue District, which is a general area for the people of Hangzhou. At that time, osmanthus trees lined the road, so it was commonly known as "Manjia Lane." Later, some literati and scholars believed that the location was right on the way to the Yixia Ridge and should not be called "Lane," so the name was changed to "Manjuelong."</p>
<p>Autumn Fragrant Kingdom: Many Osmanthus Trees are Planted</p>
<p>This year's osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong, in line with the unprecedented Zhejiang tide after the victory, also bloomed greatly. Mr. and Mrs. Chen Bulei, together with Mr. Wang Fuqing, Mr. Zhou Peiqin, and Mr. and Mrs. Chen Xunian, General Manager of this newspaper, after watching the Haining tide, toured the Nanshan area of Manjuelong with reporters. They felt that if Nanshan could be well cultivated, it could become the "Autumn Fragrant Kingdom."</p>
<p>On the 19th of the lunar calendar, after watching the Haining tide, we returned to Hangzhou. The next morning, we drove from the lakeside along the highway to Manjuelong, first passing by the Stone House Cave. As soon as we arrived at the entrance of the Stone House Cave, a burst of osmanthus fragrance wafted towards us, and the monks came to greet us, saying that there was osmanthus tea inside. Entering, we saw a few osmanthus branches in full bloom. Running to the cave, a new white paper was written on a wooden advertising sign, saying "This cave specializes in homemade osmanthus candy, osmanthus chestnuts, osmanthus flour soup, osmanthus lotus root powder, osmanthus tea," and so on.</p>
<p>Fragrant Breath in the Mountain Path</p>
<p>After exiting the Stone House Cave and climbing along the mountain road, although this road is usually a mountain path, small cars and jeeps can pass, but now, after walking less than fifty steps, several small cars are already parked in front. Abandoning the car, we climbed along the path, and a breath of fragrance floated from outside the clouds. A few steps ahead, we arrived at the Osmanthus Hall. The Osmanthus Hall is the Osmanthus Forest. Tea tables and chairs are placed under the forest, where you can taste tea and eat. On the trees in the forest, the three characters "Osmanthus Hall" are painted on a wooden board. This is the Manjuelong, a transformation from the desolation, dirt, chaos, and dispersion of spring and summer. As soon as you enter the Osmanthus Hall, someone will ask if you want "osmanthus tea," "osmanthus..." and so on. There are people selling freshly peeled osmanthus chestnuts next to the benches. We bought some to taste, and they did have the fragrance of osmanthus. In this forest, it is like entering the "Autumn Fragrant Kingdom," rich and fragrant, making people want to be intoxicated. Unfortunately, the villagers do not know how to cultivate, and those that have been cut down cannot be replanted. They also do not remove weeds, kill insects, or fertilize in spring, summer, and winter, allowing them to grow naturally. Therefore, there are no longer five thousand plants, far less than the prosperity before the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Arriving at Shuile Cave, there are still people selling osmanthus chestnut soup, etc. After leaving Shuile Cave, we climbed Yixia Cave. The fragrance of osmanthus wafted from the nose all the way. I think the open space in front of the cave can also be planted with osmanthus trees.</p>
<p>Yixia Cave Turns to Yangmei Ridge</p>
<p>From Yixia Cave, we turned to Yangmei Ridge to the Li'an Temple. There was still the fragrance of osmanthus along the way. Some people call it "Osmanthus Village." There are two or three osmanthus trees by the road, as huge as umbrellas, with golden osmanthus falling all over the ground, and the fragrance is pungent. The mountain ridges on both sides of the road are all barren mountains. Arriving at Li'an Temple, the top of the pagoda has now collapsed, and there is no nanmu branch left. The temple is very large, but the candlesticks and incense burners are full of dust. There are only two lay people in the temple, and no monks at all.</p>
<p>After leaving Li'an Temple, we went to Jiuxi Tea Plantation, where the voices of people were noisy, and there was no empty space.</p>
<p>We also went to Yunlou. The trees and bamboo were almost completely cut down by the enemy during the war, but now they are gradually becoming shaded again. The huge trees on both sides have several hugs, and the dense shade covers the path, making it a clear and beautiful place. Arriving at Yunxi Temple, part of Qilu University has moved here. Mr. Bu Xiao expressed sympathy for these hundreds of students. We smelled the fragrance of osmanthus again in Yunxi.</p>
<p>Returning from Yunxi, passing by the Six Harmonies Pagoda, the Qiantang River Bridge, we arrived at the Hupao Temple. There are several osmanthus trees in front of the Hupao Spring in the temple, and the fragrance overflows outside the courtyard. The monks said that this golden osmanthus tree is five hundred years old. This place also sells osmanthus candy and the like, and there are many tourists.</p>
<p>Brief Thoughts on the Nanshan Tour</p>
<p>This day trip to Nanshan can be said to have been immersed in the fragrance of osmanthus, but the osmanthus trees are not as many as before the victory, and empty spaces and barren mountains can be seen everywhere, which inevitably makes tourists feel regret. Since the Nanshan Osmanthus has such an appeal, it is not necessary to extensively plant osmanthus trees in the Manjue long area, and the three characters Osmanthus 桂花應刻於石板刻于石板,应 should be engraved on stone slabs and permanently placed next to the forest. Manjuelong should still set up a "Manjue Temple". The Nanshan road leading to Yixia Cave, Yangmei Ridge, Jiuxi Tea Plantation, Hupao and other places should be widely planted with osmanthus flowers, bamboo branches and pine trees, so that the wasteland will become a green field and the barren land will become a fragrant land.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Regiment Commander's Wife Being Raped: The Hospital Authorities Offer an Explanation, The Victim Attempted Suicide Several Times Out of Shame and Anger</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hankou on the 25th] The case of the regiment commander's wife being raped, which is under investigation, has caused a dispute outside the case due to the hospital authorities' protection. The hospital is based on: (1) Although there were torn and dirty clothes at the scene of the incident, there were no other traces of rape. (2) The nurses on duty and the patients in the neighboring room did not hear any sound. (3) The victim's genitals only had four abrasions on the labia minora. (4) The victim's vagina only contained soil skin cells and no sperm. (5) The rapist, Ling Zhi, has a beautiful wife in the hospital and would not do such a beastly thing. The hospital believes that this case may be consensual sex, not rape. However, this unfounded speculation has encountered strong rebuttals. (A) The date of the incident was the 9th of this month, but the hospital's examination was delayed until the 11th, which has obviously lost its accuracy. (B) Since the victim's mouth was sealed with cotton, and the rapist implemented it behind closed doors in the middle of the night, of course no one could hear the sound. (C) Ling Zhi, one of the rapists, is a doctor in the hospital, and it is inevitable that he will be biased. (D) The hospital once forced the rapists to compensate 200 million yuan to cover up the matter, which is clearly an attempt to cover up. (E) If it is consensual sex, there is no reason for there to be six people involved in the affair. Therefore, public opinion here is full of sarcasm and ridicule, dismissing it as unfounded. Even the military judge in charge of the case stated that this explanation can only be used as a reference and is not enough to affect the judgment. According to Regiment Commander Lou, his wife is loyal and has attempted suicide several times out of shame and anger after being victimized. He is eager for the authorities to deal with it strictly to save the innocent.</p>
<p>Another report: The three military judges in charge of the case will go to the hospital again for investigation. It is reported that the case has entered the decision-making stage.</p>
<h3>The Hankou Collective Rape Case: The Court Recognizes the Wedding March as an Unsolved Mystery</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hankou on the 25th] The Jingming Building collective rape case, which has been rumored in Wuhan for a long time, has been under long-term investigation by the court. The court believes that the attendees of the dance party may not have been from respectable families, and whether the obscene behavior was the result of rape is questionable. In addition, since no victim has made an accusation, and no one has been able to identify who the foreign perpetrators are, the court cannot prosecute, and the case has become an unsolved mystery. The court has truthfully replied to the police station and the municipal government.</p>
<h3>The Case of Killing the Wang Brothers: The Murderer Overturns His Old Confession, Saying That the Killing Was in Self-Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Lanzhou on the 19th] The murderer You Shoufang, who killed four of the Wang brothers and caused one death, was escorted to the Local Court Prosecutor's Office. The victims Wang Wenxuan, Wang Wenzhong, Wang Wenyi, and others, who could not wait, filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the court at the beginning of the month. After the court accepted the case, it opened an investigation court on the 9th of this month. The murderer You Shoufang overturned all the confessions he had made to the Criminal Police Team. He claimed that his motive for killing was because Wang Wenxuan owed him a lot of money. On the evening of the 8th of last month, he went to Wang's house to collect the debt. Wang Wenxuan and his four brothers not only refused to pay, but also plotted to push him into the well to kill him. When he went out to urinate, Wang Wenxuan stabbed him with a triangular scraper. Out of self-defense, he seized the murder weapon and injured four people. After reading the newspaper the next day, he learned that Wang Wenli had died of serious injuries, so he came to the city to surrender and was arrested by the Criminal Police Team. He did not confess anything about Wang's wife, Hu Qizhen. The judge then interrogated Wang Wenxuan, who claimed that You Shoufang wanted to borrow 300 million yuan without success and held a grudge. You Shoufang intended to kill his four brothers. The two sides held different views, and the case was obviously complicated. The Prosecutor's Office has now collected evidence and filed a public prosecution on the 18th for murder. The Criminal Court has scheduled another hearing.</p>

<h3>Striving to Build the Homeland: People of Hainan Support Provincial Status Measures</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chen Meiqing</p>
<p>[Haikou Dispatch, September 21] The Legislative Yuan has finally passed the resolution to make Hainan a province. This is like a long-awaited rain to the people of Hainan Island, and the joy is beyond words. The newspaper carrying this news was immediately sold out, and citizens scrambled to read it. The heavy shadow that had shrouded their faces, which had long been etched with sorrow, dissipated, and a bright and promising future unfolded before their eyes.</p>
<p>They admire Taiwan. They hope that Hainan Island can also "transform" into a second Taiwan, becoming a prosperous and stable paradise in China, allowing their tired bodies and minds, which have suffered from more than 20 years of banditry and more than seven years of Japanese occupation, to finally rest, and allowing them to develop the resources of this treasure island when they have restored their full strength. They are watching the banditry spread day by day, traffic is blocked, nine out of ten villages and households are empty, and production is sharply reduced. Lingshui County, once known as a land of fish and rice, is now under intense attack and in imminent danger. They are watching the factories left by the enemy, emitting black smoke, some shut down, some dismantled, some "seized," and large quantities of useful materials "dismembered" and disappeared without a trace. They are watching the planned development of the Yinggehai salt fields, with an annual output of 7.5 to 10 million dan, being strangled. They are watching all the construction plans being all thunder and little rain, and in the end, even turning into a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>They are watching the withering and dilapidation of their homeland, but have nowhere to turn for redress.</p>
<p>Therefore, the joy they feel about Hainan becoming a province is not simply the honor of becoming a province, but the hope that a sound provincial government with concentrated talent will rebuild the dilapidated homeland.</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed people from all walks of life and sought their opinions. Everyone unanimously refuted those so-called "conditionalists," who said things like "Hainan is not yet ready to become a province," or "Before a reasonable solution to the provincial government's finances is found, rashly changing to provincial status will be harmful and not beneficial." These are all unnecessary worries. "He who travels a hundred li considers ninety as half." As long as we are determined, work hard, and struggle, things will eventually succeed. In particular, Hainan becoming a province is related to the immediate happiness of more than two million people on the island, so of course they absolutely support all government measures.</p>
<p>Regarding the solution to the problem of provincial government finances, some people advocate that the central government subsidize a portion, a portion be levied from the local area, and another portion be borne by assigning the Leizhou Peninsula to the jurisdiction of Hainan Province to pay taxes. In this way, after a few years, the banditry on Qiongzhou Island will be completely eliminated, large and small industries will be established, agriculture will be improved, commerce will flourish, transportation will be smooth, and education will be universal, so that everyone has clothes to wear, everyone has food to eat, everyone has a house to live in, everyone has work to do, and everyone has books to read. Wouldn't all the current difficulties be completely solved?</p>
<p>Hainan Island is now on the verge of "change," just as the ancients said: "Poverty leads to change, and change leads to progress."</p>

<h3>The Import and Export Control Committee Decides on Three Methods: Preparing to Open Up Foreign Exchange with Self-Provided Funds</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Import and Export Control Committee is actively working on the matter of opening up the import of production equipment with self-provided foreign exchange. The committee decided on three methods the day before yesterday: (1) Measures for applying for the import clearance of foreign orders for which payments have already been made; (2) Methods for the Central Bank to pay foreign currency and foreign exchange deposits, and related implementation techniques for imports; (3) Measures for overseas Chinese investment in domestic production enterprises to apply for imports. After consultation and revision, the above three methods have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, the opening of foreign exchange with self-provided funds can be realized.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It was recently learned from the Central Bank that according to Article 9 of the Measures for the Payment of Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Deposits promulgated by the Executive Yuan on August 26, "Foreign currency and foreign exchange depositors who have any of the following uses may apply to the original deposit bank for payment of their deposits with the original deposit certificate and approved supporting documents: (1) Those who have been approved by the Ministry of Education to study abroad themselves, their spouses, or their children; (2) Industrial and commercial enterprises or industrial and commercial groups that have been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to send personnel abroad for business negotiations or inspections as needed; (3) Those whose own, spouse, or direct relatives continue to reside abroad and whose original retained amount is insufficient for expenses, and who have been approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after being forwarded by the local embassy or consulate; (4) Those whose own, spouse, or direct relatives suffer from serious illnesses and must go abroad for treatment, and who have been approved by the Ministry of Health; (5) Other necessary and legitimate uses approved by the Ministry of Finance." In order to facilitate the application procedures for foreign currency and foreign exchange depositors, the bank is now sending telegrams to the Ministries of Education, Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, and Health to request that they quickly formulate and announce the review standards and detailed measures for the above items (1), (2), (3), and (4) in order to provide a basis for compliance.</p>
<h3>No Increase in Arrivals, Sluggish Trading: Rice Prices Unchanged; Flour Market Still Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rice prices have seen little fluctuation, but trading is still not smooth. Arrivals have not increased, and exports are not high. High-quality Indica rice is priced at 18.2 yuan, while Japonica rice is rarely available on the market, and high-quality rice is even more scarce. Therefore, although prices are stable, transactions are few. The prices in the two markets are unchanged from the previous day. Registered arrivals were 1,499 shi in the South Market and 1,842 shi in the North Market, totaling 3,341 shi.</p>
<p>Flour: Still closed. Because the market held a general meeting of all members yesterday to elect the management director, etc., transactions could not be carried out, the supply was very small, and there were few sellers. There were also no transactions in bran.</p>
<p>Grains: Firm and expensive, trading is increasingly light due to the scarcity of sellers. The supply of soybeans is very small, and Adzuki beans and kidney beans are available in small quantities. Corn continues to be absorbed by Northern merchants and is still traded at limited prices. Red sorghum is firm and sellers are scarce. Yuan wheat from out-of-town merchants is being sold off, rising by 3-4 jiao. Peas are being taken by Northern merchants, rising by 2 jiao. Sesame is flat and weak, and shelled peanuts are available in small quantities.</p>
<p>Residual Oil: Continues to decline, being locked up is narrow, local demand is very weak, resulting in sluggish sales. Soybean oil fell to 48.5 yuan at the close due to a large amount of bulk goods. Rapeseed oil also fell by 2 yuan to close at 45 yuan. Stocks of raw oil are scarce and uniquely firm. Small cart sesame oil also fell by 9 jiao. Soybean cake is supplied by the factory separately, 100 pieces per household, priced at 4.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Merchants Register Inventory</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Strict Prohibition of Overdrafts by Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Audit Department of the Central Bank recently sent a circular to all branches, stating that since the implementation of the use of bills as currency, banks and money shops have often entered into temporary overdraft contracts with customers as a disguised form of bill use. In order to implement government orders, this temporary overdraft should be strictly prohibited. It has also been reported that there are many customers of banks and money shops who open accounts in their personal names. Most of them have normal receipts and payments, but there are also many suspicious cases. In the future, any suspicious large transactions will be strictly investigated.</p>
<h3>Collecting Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency: No Extension of Deadline</h3>
<p>Overdue possession will result in confiscation or punishment</p>
<p>More than a month has passed since the Central Government promulgated new emergency economic measures on August 19, strictly prohibiting the people from holding gold, silver, and foreign currency. In recent days, citizens have been enthusiastically exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan notes at designated receiving banks in the city. There are only five days left until the end of the collection period (September 30), and there will be no extension after the deadline. The Executive Yuan telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday to inform them. According to the law, if the people still hold gold, silver, or foreign currency after the deadline, they will be confiscated or punished separately once discovered. Therefore, it is expected that when the deadline is approaching, citizens holding gold, silver, and foreign currency will be even more crowded to hand them in. It is hoped that the people will send them in as soon as possible to avoid heavy losses after the deadline.</p>
<p>The Philippine currency has also officially begun to be collected. According to the Central Bank's announcement yesterday, the collection figures for the city on the 24th were as follows: (Gold) 35,395.959 taels, (Silver) 25,413.05 taels, (Silver Dollars) 194,896.5 pieces, (Silver Coins) 146,817 pieces, (US Dollars) 702,999.82 yuan, (Hong Kong Dollars) 130,409.95 yuan, (Philippine Pesos) 3,024 yuan, totaling Gold Yuan notes 10,485,396.99 yuan.

<h3>Market Nervousness Leads to Frequent Selling: Cotton Yarn Prices Fall After Rising; Loosening Supply from Holders Leads to Thriving Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn prices fell yesterday after rising in the morning. The market was nervous, and the authorities urged the registration of inventory. Small holders were afraid of complications, and there were many sales on the market, which lowered the market. All grades of 42-count yarn fell below the price limit, averaging a decrease of 10 yuan.</p>
<p>40-count yarn also showed weakness. Although there were many offers of 32-count yarn, demand was also strong, showing a slight decline. 21-count Double Horse yarn was traded within the limit, without much difference. For 20-count yarn, except for Double Happiness, Golden Double Chicken, Red Double Pigeon, which fell slightly, the rest were traded at the limit price, and the trend was stagnant and fluctuations were reduced. 16-count yarn was the same as yesterday, but the willingness to sell was slightly reduced. 1,000-count Boy Scout yarn recovered by 5 yuan, while the rest remained flat.</p>
<p>The cloth market showed a slight recovery. Since the news of commodity registration came out, cloth prices have fallen the most sharply. Other commodity prices have fallen less. Moreover, cloth prices in other areas are brisk, and the willingness of holders to supply has loosened, and the market is recovering.</p>
<p>The market opened high in the morning, with leading fine cloth quoted at 27.4 yuan, a sharp increase of 8 jiao from the previous closing price. Holders still sold, and prices fell to 26.5 yuan, but closed at 26.7 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao. Leading B fine cloth closed at 25 yuan, an increase of 6 jiao. Lower-grade fine cloths such as Five Blessings and Trumpet Children all recovered by 5 to 7 jiao. Colored cloth, Four Gentlemen, Yuan Serge, etc., were all selling well due to the season. Four Gentlemen Yuan Straight Tribute Serge hit the 30-yuan limit, and most others were firm. Total transactions in the city were 2,460 pieces.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Textile Association of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai-Nanjing region held the third meeting of the third phase of the joint yarn allocation for private factories yesterday, opening 1,025 pieces of 20-count yarn. According to the reports to the association on the sales of yarn and cloth by various private factories on the 24th and 25th, the total amount was equivalent to 1,426 pieces of 20-count yarn and 22,215 pieces of cotton cloth.</p>
<h3>Weak Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>The raw cotton market trend turned weak yesterday. With the registration of inventory by the industry, small holders were eager to sell. Moreover, new cotton from the suburbs had arrived in small quantities, and the market was nervous. However, it was Saturday, and the market was quiet, with only sporadic transactions. The market seemed weak. The supply of Zhoupu seed cotton was scarce, and the market was slightly better.</p>

<h3>Spokesman for the Ministry of Education Issues Statement: Hopes Displaced Students Will Return to School Quickly: The Eight Temporary Secondary Schools and Combined Secondary Schools Are Sufficient to Accommodate</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch, September 25] A spokesman for the Ministry of Education recently issued a statement on the arrangements for the resettlement and resumption of studies for students from the displaced areas of Shandong and Henan provinces, as well as the progress made. It stated: Students from the bandit-controlled areas of Shandong and Henan provinces have been affected by the banditry and have come south to gather in the capital, numbering tens of thousands. At the request of local authorities, the Ministry of Education has established temporary secondary schools and combined secondary schools in the Jiangnan area to accommodate and resettle them. However, the students came in a hurry and their numbers are increasing daily. As of recently, nearly 20,000 people have arrived in Beijing. Temporary secondary schools and combined secondary schools have been selected in the Beijing-Shanghai area and the two provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and are combined with the Zhongyuan Temporary Secondary School previously established in Henan, which can accommodate more than 20,000 people in total. Since the beginning of this month, the principals of various schools in Shandong and Henan provinces have led the students to return to school one after another. The students in Beijing can be evacuated completely before the 28th. The students who came to Beijing this time were unwilling to be coerced by the bandits and traveled a long and difficult journey to return. Their aspirations and experiences are worthy of sympathy. The government is concerned about the students' studies and has made every effort to provide relief and resettlement. However, in the past month, students in Beijing have repeatedly gathered to cause trouble, which has seriously affected social security and is regrettable. Currently, the banditry is rampant and the country is in difficulty. It is hoped that the students will strictly abide by order, cherish their time, and quickly go to the designated locations to resume classes. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life will show sympathy and comfort to the students who have come to seek refuge from various places, and assist the government in guiding their emotions, so that it will be easier to stabilize order and avoid causing trouble.

<h3>Hao Gengsheng Lectures to Primary and Secondary School Teachers on Physical Education in British and American Elementary Schools; Britain Emphasizes Physical Education Teachers</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Municipal Gymnasium invited Inspector Hao Gengsheng to lecture on physical education in British and American elementary schools. Over 700 physical education teachers from municipal private primary and secondary schools and enthusiasts of physical education attended the lecture. Prior to the lecture, the Electro-Education Group installed a sound system, and the sound was clear and audible. Director Shao gave a speech first, followed by Mr. Hao's lecture. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Britain and the United States attach great importance to physical education, especially children's physical education, which is the most important stage of life and the foundation for cultivating adults. The outstanding performance of Britain and the United States in the World Games is entirely due to the facilities for children's health education. Children's health requires good nutrition and sleep, and appropriate exercise. Elementary school physical education is the most important training for children's education, that is, the cultivation of general physical fitness should start from the elementary school curriculum. Although Britain's economic situation is far inferior to that of the United States, it pays great attention to children's physical education. (1) Although Britain does not have perfect equipment, it has vast grounds and makes full use of them to give children ample opportunities to be active. (2) Britain can use the environment and equipment, even a table and a rope, as tools for children's activities. (3) Emphasis is placed on children's games and sports, and grouping methods are established to ensure widespread activity. (4) Adding movies or slides to physical education games and activities is more effective. (5) Attention is paid to the school's sanitary environment, and there are appropriate places for exercise and rest. (6) Attention is paid to the growth and development of children's bodies, and children's physical fitness and good habits are checked.</p>
<p>Britain now has the slogan "A good system is important, but a good teacher is more important than a system." Therefore, Britain has a universal and strict physical education teacher test. All physical education teachers must participate in this test and take pride in achieving excellent results. This also increases the opportunity for physical education teachers to continue their studies. Women's education is highly valued. Although it is mainly for good mothers, the improvement of the level of physical education in elementary schools should be attributed to women's education.</p>
<p>Because of its abundant resources, American elementary schools have widely developed physical education, and there are many things to learn from. Finally, it is hoped that the physical education community will take responsibility for children's physical education and continue to work hard in difficult circumstances. It is believed that elementary school physical education in our country will have a bright future.</p>

<h3>Is the Wife Scary?</h3>
<p>— Qinling</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Xu Qinwen's article "The Wife's Scary" published in the 19th issue of this journal, I was filled with emotions and wrote a few words to defend the wife class.</p>
<p>Mr. Qinwen's original intention was only to highlight the difficulties of life by contrasting it with the sorrow of the husband; however, is it not also the wife's sorrow that the wife is thus considered scary?</p>
<p>An old classmate, Miss Ding—now she should be called Mrs. Ma—often writes to complain that three children are wearing her down. Before the victory, she lived in the countryside of Shapingba, Chongqing, carrying water, climbing mud, eating the tomatoes and potatoes she planted herself, wearing patched-up cloth gowns, and thought that she could be comfortable when she arrived in Shanghai. Who knew that she only rented a front building after spending several years of savings, and her whole family was still squeezed together, and she was still constantly working all day long. The hands that used to play the piano were calloused, and the dizziness and anemia made her look nothing like the beauty she used to be. However, Mr. Ma's temper increased along with his status, and he would throw things around at the slightest provocation. If the children were noisy and he couldn't read, it was the wife's fault; if he was too late for work and missed business, it was the wife's fault; if a month's salary was not enough for half a month's expenses, it was even more the wife's fault! The couple often argued, and their relationship deteriorated considerably. In fact, Ma Guangsheng did not have affairs, did not have hobbies, went out early and returned late, and was very well-behaved. In fact, it was still an economic problem. Money was not abundant, his mood was not good, and his temper became bad. This is certainly not Mr. Ma's fault. Prices are rising every day, and he is frugal, but a month's income is still not enough to spend. How can he not be worried? But can it be said that it is the wife's fault?</p>
<p>Let's talk about my old friend Miss Li. Recently, I received a letter saying that she had decided to leave Peiping and return to the south. She went to Peiping to get married in the summer of the year before last. The couple were both civil servants. Last year, they had a child and hired an old nanny to take care of the house and the child. In addition to going to work, she also breastfed. As a result, the child was weak and she was exhausted. She always told us: "You will be surprised if you see me now, because I am almost half as thin as I was in Shanghai!" What is even more urgent is that she had another child this summer. She said: "We both go to work at the same time. An old nanny is unwilling to take care of two children. It is not allowed to hire two old nannies due to economic constraints. If I sit at home and take care of the children, his income alone is not enough to support the family. There is no way, so I have to return to the south and live off the ancestral property!"</p>
<p>Once you have a family, who doesn't want to live a happy and peaceful life? Looking angry is not a pleasant thing after all. As long as wives can work, they are willing to help their husbands share the responsibility, but although the principle is so, if there are too many children and you can't take care of one thing without neglecting the other, you have to retreat and manage the home. (In this respect, women also sacrifice themselves quite a bit.) Living in this era, couples need to endure hardship together, understand and be considerate of each other in order to overcome difficulties and get through the difficult times together, which cannot be solved by blaming and condemning each other.</p>
<p>Recently, family disputes have become one of the main social problems. These examples make people who are about to get married feel doubtful and fearful about "marriage." The term "wife" is indeed scary in the eyes of our women.</p>
<h3>New Inventions</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>There is a genius in New York who has invented a soup spoon with a small fan attached. The fan can cool the soup in the spoon, so that the person drinking it will not be scalded and retract their head and stick out their tongue.</p>
<p>A person in Spokan, Washington has invented an oyster opener and has registered a patent with the government. This new device specifically for opening oysters will emit a sound that can stimulate curious oysters to open their shells. Taking advantage of the opportunity when the shells are open, the person eating the oysters can easily dig out the oyster meat.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army has used sound in jungles to lure and kill mosquitoes that transmit epidemics. They created a "wolf beep" sounder, which emits a pitch similar to the sound of a female mosquito's wings flapping. The foolish male mosquitoes follow the artificial sound to mate, and as a result, become romantic ghosts who die under the sounder.</p>
<p>Modern women spend an astonishing amount of time in barbershops. In order to relieve women's boredom while "doing their hair," a man in California created a new type of "hair dryer" with a built-in wireless radio, which can be used to listen to music and relieve boredom at any time, making it a holy product for leisure.</p>
<p>Yale Townie Company has invented a "one-armed" spring latch. With this latch installed, a person returning home with both hands full does not have to put down the things in both hands when opening the door lock and turning the handle, but only needs to free one hand to open the door and enter the room.</p>
<p>A manufacturer has designed a new type of electric washing machine that not only washes clothes but also grates yams and freezes ice cream.</p>
<h3>Strange Laws in America</h3>
<p>— Qifeng</p>
<p>Can you imagine? If you sing in a bar in Wisconsin, drive a crimson car in Minneapolis, eavesdrop on people in Oklahoma, or wear transparent clothes (including silk stockings) as a woman in Rhode Island, you are violating local laws!</p>
<p>Animals are equally protected by law. In Ohio, if you ride a male donkey, you cannot exceed six miles per hour; in North Carolina, you cannot use an elephant instead of a cow, horse, or machine to cultivate cotton fields; in Oklahoma, you cannot catch whales in inland seas; and in Pennsylvania, you cannot even kill a snake unless it bites you!</p>
<p>Most people think that the relationship between men and women in the United States is extremely indulgent and free, but this is not always the case. In Oregon, according to local law, a girl cannot ride in a car with a young man without the accompaniment of a guardian; in Utah, men and women can only dance during the day; and in Pennsylvania, women's underwear cannot be hung on clotheslines unless it is covered with a cloth.</p>
<p>Even for love affairs between men and women, the law has not been neglected in the slightest. Not many years ago, an unlucky husband was fined fifteen yuan for kissing his wife in a park in Chicago. In Georgia, kissing in public is also prohibited. The method of proposing marriage is simple, unique, and easy to implement: in Massachusetts, you only need to kiss your lover ten times to propose marriage; in Minnesota, you only need to bring some sweets and gifts, and embrace and kiss her passionately in front of your sweetheart's parents to show that you love her and want to marry her.</p>
<p>Once you get married, if you live in Delaware, you can say anything disrespectful or slanderous to your wife, and the law will not intervene; in Michigan, the law gives the husband the ownership of his wife's clothes, and if the wife leaves him, all of her clothes will belong to the husband.</p>
<p>Even more absurd and unreasonable laws are that fathers in New York cannot change their children's diapers, residents of Boston cannot raise a dog that stands more than ten inches tall; thieves in Kentucky can only be caught at night; men's beards in Indiana are considered to be sources of germs, especially men who often kiss are not allowed to keep beards; and prisoners in South Carolina must pay the police one yuan for riding in a prison car to prison!</p>
<h3>Catching Thieves</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>Late last night, the storeroom of a nearby tea shop suddenly became very noisy, interspersed with laughter, which reverberated throughout the neighborhood. Upon inquiring this morning, I learned that a thief had been caught, which was quite amusing. Because the thief had entered by breaking through the wall, the tea workers had learned about it early. So they used a very large bamboo basket (usually used to store tea leaves) and waited at the place where he had broken through. Seeing that he had pierced the wall and crawled in, they covered him with the tea basket from the head down, enclosing the thief completely in the basket, and he was captured. The noise and laughter also erupted at this time, when the tea workers were in high spirits.</p>
<p>I remember that in the dormitory of a certain school in the past, there was a thief who broke through the wall, which was known to the students. So they tied a rope into a circle at the entrance of the hole to wait. The thief put one foot in first, and it happened to enter the circle. The students quickly tightened the knot and tied the thief's foot, while the thief's body was still outside the wall. The students discussed ways to punish the thief. A prankster suggested removing his shoes and socks and brushing the soles of his feet with a hard brush to make him unbearable. The thief was indeed afraid of the itch. Every time he was brushed, his feet twitched and trembled, and he was in a state of embarrassment. The students also laughed loudly. Unexpectedly, the brushing became more and more rapid. The thief couldn't bear the abuse and tried his best to break free. The rope was broken, and he ran to the river. He jumped out and fell into the river with a bang. The river was deep and rapid. It is not known where this thief drifted.</p>
<h3>Standard American</h3>
<p>— Fengling</p>
<p>The Gallup Poll, the most famous public opinion polling organization in the United States, reports that a standard American is like this.</p>
<p>His height is five feet nine inches, and his weight is one hundred and fifty-eight pounds. (This is the average height and weight of American men.)</p>
<p>Six out of ten men prefer women with black hair and black eyes.</p>
<p>The average height of American women is five feet four inches, and they weigh one hundred and thirty-two pounds.</p>
<p>Two out of every three adults (including men and women) wear glasses. One out of every five people has slightly drooping ears. One out of ten people prefers to operate with their left hand.</p>
<p>Americans generally have poor memories. Less than one-third can remember their car license plate number.</p>
<p>One out of three people refuses to get up early, and one out of five people often suffers from insomnia.</p>
<p>The average American goes to bed at ten o'clock and gets up at six-thirty in the morning six days a week, but on Saturday nights, he often doesn't go to bed until eleven o'clock and doesn't get up until eight o'clock on Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>Six out of ten American adults like to drink and smoke.</p>
<p>Ninety-six percent of Americans believe in God, and seventy-six percent believe that there is a soul after death.</p>
<p>Only four percent of the people in the United States feel unhappy with their lives; fifty-seven percent feel fairly satisfied; thirty-eight percent feel that life is extremely good and happy; but one percent feel that they don't know whether they are happy or not (translated from the September issue of Reader's Digest).</p>
<h3>South Society Luminary Pang Bozi</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Pang Lezi was a leading figure in the South Society, renowned throughout Jiangnan, but slander followed, to the point where he became unacceptable in his hometown. After his death, Zhou Mengpo of Wucheng and Liu Qiji of Wujiang gathered funds to publish his collected poems and essays, but none of his fellow townsmen contributed a single penny. Mr. Xiao Tui'an wrote a biography for him, and Tui'an was also someone who did not enjoy living in his hometown.</p>
<p>Bozi, named Shubai, styled himself Ba'an, and was from Changshu. During the late Qing Dynasty, he and Liu Qiji and Chen Qubing organized the South Society, advocating nationalism. During the Xinhai Revolution, Panzi was a professor at St. John's University and an editor of the National Essence Journal. After Shanghai was restored, Yezi and Song Jiaoren participated in secret meetings. The uprising in Changshu was also instigated by Bozi. Bozi was young and courageous in undertaking responsibilities, advocating for the abolition of corvée labor, as corvée labor had long been a problem for the people. One day, Bozi was sipping tea in the Lake Garden when dozens or hundreds of corvée laborers, holding incense sticks with fiercely burning flames, feigned a petition and swarmed to burn his forehead, leaving it scorched and scarred. Fortunately, someone grabbed him and helped him escape over the window, thus saving him. He then went to the sea and served as the literary secretary of the Shanghai Military Governor. However, those who slandered him in his hometown did not stop. He then gave up on worldly affairs, entertaining himself with literature and wine, eventually becoming dissolute and unrestrained, and died at the young age of only thirty-three. Vice Minister Zhu Guwei edited his "Yu Cheng Cong Guan Ci Gao" (Jade Sounding Pavilion Song Lyrics), and famous scholars of the time, such as Shao Cigong, Xu Zhongke, Wu Qu'an, and Ye Sheyu, all wrote inscriptions. Liu Qiji, Wang Dezhong, and Wang Zhuanong each wrote prefaces or postscripts. His "Longchan Studio Poems" were appended to the lyrics. Rongzi's lyrics followed the style of the Southern Song Dynasty, not deviating from the styles of Baishi and Yutian, adhering to strict rules, and were deeply appreciated by Zhu Guwei. His lyric "Peach Blossom Spring Reminiscence of an Old Friend," which used the eight characters "rain threads, wind slices, misty waves, painted boat" to lead the phrases, was particularly elegant. The lyrics read: "In the misty rain, spring has no shadow; the willow threads are like a sick person. The wind cuts through the silk clothes and it's still cold; fragments of dreams awaken before the flowers. The mist faintly obscures the green, hard to recognize; the waves ripple, urging slumber. Paint the beautiful scenery of old; the boat carries the hatred of Jiangnan."</p>
<p>After Song Jiaoren was martyred, Lezi would shed tears every year on the anniversary of his death. He once wrote a poem lamenting him, saying: "...Gouging out the eyes still grieves for Wu Zixu; where to call back the soul and weep for three banquets? From this, I know that talent and fate are difficult to share; but let's say that kindness and hatred have been planned sparsely..." These words are extremely sorrowful. The line about talent and fate can also be used to mourn Ziye. His other works include "Lingyan Chang," "Longchan Studio Gleanings," and several surviving essays and diaries.</p>
<h3>Horses' Hooves and Knights</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<p>In public places, we often see many bronze and stone statues, many of which depict famous generals on horseback. But besides admiring the style of these heroes, we rarely know that the horse's posture actually hints at the hero's fate.</p>
<p>Western sculptors have a commonly observed convention regarding "horses' hooves and knights":</p>
<p>(1) If the horse in the statue has two hind hooves on the ground and two front hooves in the air, it means that the knight who rode the horse died in battle.</p>
<p>(2) If the horse has three hooves on the ground and one hoof raised in the air, it indicates that the person who rode the horse was wounded in war.</p>
<p>(3) If the horse's four hooves are all safely on the ground, it indicates that the knight who rode this horse was not wounded in war.</p>
<p>These conventions are universally observed in Europe and America. However, we do not know whether Chinese sculptors follow them.</p>
<h3>Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>A truly good writer will immediately draw the reader into another world, to appreciate its strange scenery and unusual objects. After reading their book, the reader feels as if they have traveled to another world and returned. This is because good writers, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, each have their own world, their own heaven and earth, their own cosmos, and their own universe.</p>
<p>Christianity says that God created heaven and earth and all things; truly good writers can also create heaven and earth and all things.</p>
<p>The writers of ancient times may be dead, but the other world they created is still preserved in their writings. Just wipe away the cobwebs and dust from its gates, and the pavilions, terraces, forests, springs, mountains, and rocks within are mostly intact.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are certainly not just one; within the cobweb-covered and dust-sealed writings, many grotto-heavens and blessed lands are preserved. It is only because there is no golden scenery and no jade-like beauty that visitors are so few.</p>
<p>It is said that the tickets to today's grotto-heavens and blessed lands are very expensive; that is true, but they are probably not much more expensive than seeing a movie. Moreover, these grotto-heavens and blessed lands are unlike the ordinary grotto-heavens and blessed lands in the human world. Once you buy a ticket, this grotto-heaven and blessed land will belong to you for life, becoming your private kingdom. You can visit it whenever you please, day or night, according to your wishes. Even more convenient is that you can visit while sitting or lying down.</p>
<p>I recalled my feelings while reading Su Dongpo's poetry collection and suddenly felt this way, so I wrote it down.</p>
<h3>Funds Sent to Mr. Feng Zikai for His Trip to Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Friends warmly gather, welcoming Master Yuhao,</p>
<p>Laughing and talking, eagerly joining the line.</p>
<p>The spring breeze graces the guests at the table,</p>
<p>The autumn moon illuminates the sails before the window.</p>
<p>Drain the bottle, no lament for the absence of fish,</p>
<p>Raise the chopsticks, forget the desire for meat in Yunnan (The Master is vegetarian, abstaining from meat but not fish).</p>
<p>Understanding the Zen, one is half drunk,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, crossing the sea, Meng Ke will be light.</p>
<h3>Drinking Alone with Crabapple Flowers at the Leisurely Retreat</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wenwei</p>
<p>Don't recall before the wine cup,</p>
<p>Joys and sorrows are equally empty.</p>
<p>How pitiful the distant spring dreams,</p>
<p>Many thanks to the red crabapple flowers.</p>
<p>Breaking off a twig, new verses are formed,</p>
<p>Where does the wind of the crying crow come from?</p>
<p>Willow catkins drift easily to their end,</p>
<p>The setting sun slants east of the corridor again.</p>
