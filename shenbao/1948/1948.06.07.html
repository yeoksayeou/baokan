<p>〔本報南京六日電〕本年下半年之全國收支總預算，新財長王雲五已着手計算籌劃。王氏到部後，已分別與各主管單位負責人談話研究下半年收入之可能數目，並計劃增闢新稅源。王氏已囑各單位主管負責人，尤其主持稅務之首長，先行詳細硏究計劃。日內將召集會議一次，專門硏討下半年收支如何平衡。據有關人士之概略估計上半年各種稅收之預算，為三十餘萬億元。惟貨物稅收可能及五十萬億元。處理敵偽物資之所得約為二十萬億元。然上半年收支相抵，實際仍差百分之五十。下半年全國收支總預算，預計稅收可達二百萬億元。然根據本年上半年物價上漲率之估計，下半年之總支出，可能達×百萬億。收支相差仍鉅，王氏除擬增闢稅源外，並擬下下列方式，增加國家收入：（一）出售國營事業。（二）處理敵偽物資，（三）處理日本賠償物資，（四）美援。以期收支之逐漸接近平衡。據王氏數日來之計算與籌劃，收支相抵，仍將有老干距離。日來仍在百方考慮彌補差額方法中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕王雲五為籌劃增加國家收入，以挽救目前經濟難關，現正考慮舉辦一次財產稅，俾有錢者以其過分之利得，彌補國家財政上之危機。王氏對舉辦一次財產稅已具決心，認此為增闢稅源之唯一方法。惟對於執行之技術，則認為請多困難，尙待從詳研究。王氏五日召見某稅務負責人，即已談及此事。</p>

<p>〔本報南京六日電〕新行政院為平衡預算，審核政府機關外匯，決設預算審查委員會，其組織規程業經政院第一次臨時會議通過，列為院內各種特種委員會之一。關於預算外匯案件，原由政院會計處承辦，現因新政院不設會計處，故關於外匯部份，亦由預算審查委會處理。該會之任務有六：（一）關於各機關施政方針與預算配合事項；（二）關於各機關歲入歲出預算之審查及總預算之審查事項；（三）關於預算內外匯之結購事項；（四）關於預算外外匯之審查事項；（五）關於動支第一一預備金及統籌科目之審查事項；（六）其他有關預算及外匯之交議事項。該會設主任委員一人，規定由政院副院長顧孟餘兼任，委員為主計長徐堪，財長王雲五，中央銀行總裁兪鴻鈞，政務委員雷震，董　光，楊永浚，鄭振文，及秘長李惟果等，規定每週開會兩次，一次審查預算，一次審查外匯。此後所有提院會討論之預算及外匯案件，統先交該會審查。</p>

<p>〔本報北平五日電〕燕京大學代理校長陸志韋稱：司徒大使聲明，主要係對半官方之反對美國扶植日本而發，與知識分子或學生的關係想來倒少。陸氏認為美國扶植日本是程度問題，而現在尙不到恢復侵略勢力之程度。但美在亞東之防蘇計劃如遭失敗。則扶日防蘇是必然的。但張伯倫上的希特勒的當，美國很淸楚。故不會蹈其覆轍。今天重要的還是要自已掙氣，現在豈非任何人皆在欺侮中國。</p>

<h3 id="c31">如何抑平物價的漲風！ <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>五月下旬物價稍平，但至本月四五兩日，京滬物價又在蠢蠢欲動了。據南京訊，最高當局對此異常重視，行政　對於抑平漲風，也已商定對策，即將次第實行。但是如何抑平物價漲風？這在最近的十年來，在當局可稱已想　了方法，諸如：（一）限佩，（二）議價（三）標價，（四）拋售，（五）嚴禁投機囤積，（立）抽緊銀根，（七）限制出口轉口，（八）厲行監察與檢查，（九）實施配給等，或多或少，皆嘗作相當程度的推行。但把各地的物價指數表翻開來一看，可知這些措施，非但完全無效，而且有變本加属，愈壓愈漲的趨勢。所以新行政院對於物價若欲使其穩定，則不得不進一步，另從根本　從速補救。</p>
<p>其實所謂根本辦法，也是大家都知道的，不外乎兩途：（一）停止發鈔；（二）增加生產；因爲物價是幣與物的對比，如通貨依舊膨脹，而物資供不應求，則無諭運用任何技巧，都沒有把牠强行壓低的可能。關於停止通貨膨賬這一層，我們曾主張利用美援物費所變售的價款來，作爲赤字財政的彌補，藉以緩和新鈔的發行，而近來有關當局的表示，亦多作如此主張。如能商得美方同意，看來此路已沒有大問題。又新任王財長就職之日，並曾宣稱：財部施政，仍以開源節流爲主。這話如果眞能兌現，再輔以上述美援這筆額外收入，我們相信：至少在短時期以內，通貨膨脹，縱未必能完全停止，大約暫時緩和一下，總不會沒有希望的。</p>
<p>但在增加生產這一點，究竟如何有效地推行，確尙待多方努力。增產運動，這名目並不算新奇，諸如糧食增產，棉花增產，絲繭增產等等，其口號和計劃，大家早已耳熱能詳。然而實際數字，年來並沒有繭著增加，其所可獲得的各類產品，又以匪亂，交通等等障礙，往往貨素於地，宋能順利達到加工或最後消費的目的，其幸而到達製造階段時，更以種種不合理的管制，和動力，機械，費金等牽制，往往供需失調，遭遇到呆擱和滯銷的影響；是表面上儘管高唱增產運動，而事實上還是硬逼到减產這方向走去；加上游資充斥，投機旺盛，物價的漲風，怎能加以遏阻？但由我們看來，爲調劑供求以穩定物價起見，此後在增加生產方面，必須切實推行下列四項措置：</p>
<p>第一，安定生產的環境其中包括勞資關係的改進，役政糧政的改善，和地方治安的加强等，總期從事生產的人，不諭是農是工，皆能安心工作，樂於爲大衆服務，而一般企業家，於合理的法令範團之內，放手經營，無所顧忌，如此各種生產事業，始能順利進展。</p>
<p>第二，解除商民的痛苦政府各種措施，在表面上，無一不是爲商民謀便利，所謂獎進，鼓勵，扶助等等字樣，隨在可見，而實際上則便利商民的功效，遠不如束縛剝削的痛苦爲多，這於奉行不善者半，而由於立法欠周者亦半·立法院應即大刀闊斧，　所有繁碎苛　重複無謂的法令與手續，痛加沙汰，切實與民更始，務使商民之於政府，發生相親相愛之情感，而勿存疑懷與壓　之心理，然後官商可以真誠合作，生產可以積極推進。</p>
<p>第三，減輕商民的負擔，在這行憲戡亂時期，費用浩繁，單需尤　，自不能不如王財長所說積極開源，增加稅收，以避免發行的急劇增加，這是大衆所能共同了解與諒解的。其大憲在（一）稅率有時太高，以至妨礙生產，發生所謂殺雞取卵的現象；（二）疊床架屋，重復課征；（三）陽襲管制之名，陰寓漁利之實，任令一般聚歛之吏，假借名義，專打小算盤；（四）各地方巧立名目，任意抽捐課稅，漫無限制，其各種公私攤派，尤屬花樣翻新，層出不窮。這不但加重成本，使生產者與消費者無力員担，抑且誅求無藝使成本無法計算，更予生產者以致命的打擊。</p>
<p>第四，增進金融的便利由於通貨膨脹，存款激减的結果，一般商業行莊的資力，今已大非昔比。欲促進工商業的活動，與生產事業的圓滑進行，國家行局，實不容不採取更積極的手段，透過商業行莊，儘量融通，以發揮金融的效能。現行的抽緊銀根政策，在治標方面，雖未嘗沒有暫時的功效，但商業因而停頓，生產難免阻滯。况時而抽緊，時而放鬆，徒使正當商人疲於奔命，不敢放手營運，而投機之徒，轉可乘瑕蹈隙，有以窺見間歇式張弛的弱點，這與安定物價的目標，實不免背道而馳。至於限制內匯，限制運現，無異在物資交流的中間，築起一道高高的堤防來，使原料與成品，無法自由交換，這於增產運動，尤覺格格不入。</p>

<p>改革幣制不獲蘇聯合作　西德將單獨實施　柏林盟管會有重開可能　　〔路透社柏林五日〕可靠方面息，德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基召集其主要財政及政治顧問，於星期一在其柏林總司令部開會。接近蘇軍政府之德國政界人士相信，此次會議將決定蘇聯方面對西德於本月內所將實行幣制改革之態度。預料蘇當局成將從事最後一次準備，以謀重開四强談判，討論整個德國之幣制改革。政界人士指出向蘇登記之德文柏林夜快報近曾發表社論，籲請德境法軍總司令寇尼許於六月十五日以前召開盟管會會議，盛傳六月十五日即爲實施西德幣制改革之最後限期。政界人士相信蘇聯本身當不願主動發起重開盟管會會議，但若係由他强召集則蘇聯當樂於參加。此間法官員亦表示相信盟管會可望於六月十日召開，以爲三月二十日索柯洛夫斯基退出盟管會以來所召開之第一次盟管會。德國各黨人士亦莫不切盼盟管會得以重開會議，認爲此乃避免東西德國各自實施幣制改革之最後機會，以防德國之陷入肯定分裂的地位。　　另據極可靠方面自蘇佔區內傳來報告梅，該處蘇聯主持之團體及當局，對德人已開始採取緩和及討好政策。自六月一日以來，警察之檢查公路鐵路旅客已大見放寬，共黨控制之自由德國工運人員並赴區內各地訪問敎會人士，自願與敎會在計劃中之社會改革計劃合作，另一共黨控制之團體農民會，亦突然减少其政治宣傳，而致力於農村復興計劃。一般咸信蘇　此種政策之目的，在拉攏人心，團結儘大部份之德人組成國民陣綫，以準備宣布東德國之成立，以對抗西方盟國所將設立之西德國。　　〔聯台社倫教五日電〕外交界負實人士稱，西方國家擬立即與蘇聯成立協議，以便在整個德國樹立健全與統一的幣制，以供國內與國際貿易之用，詳情尙未露佈。此種行動成功之機會，可於蘇聯與西方國家力辯統一幣制之需要見之。美英法比荷盧六國已就此事成立新協定。蘇聯最近譴責西方德家尤其是美國，破壞關於德國財政改組之四國柏林談判，美英兩國均否認此種指責。近數星期來，英外相貝文與德境美軍政府長官克萊已表示希望推行全國性之新幣，蘇聯　倘反對此種要求，或欲無限期加以擱置，聞西方國家將單獨進行西德之幣制改革計劃。范登堡將盡最大努力謀恢復援外原額　準備出席參院撥款會陳述意見　　〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕參院外委會主席范登堡今日致書參院撥款委會主席勃里奇，要求准其出席作證，提出反對削减援外費用之意見。范氏此舉表示渠將親自領導參院之努力，以謀恢復經衆院削减後之援外費用。范氏之友透露，援外法案之得經國會通過，大部份得力於范氏，今聞衆院通過削减後的撥款案，對其是不啻如一重大打擊，故范氏正傾其全力，以謀恢復原來數額。　　另據國務部人士稱，馬歇爾方案費用之削减，係受最近蘇聯和平攻勢之影響，蓋蘇聯之和平攻勢已减輕最近數月來國際上之緊張形勢，因此使衆院撥款委會認爲毋需撥付如許鉅額費用以援他國。國務部官員因此在過去卅六小時中，在國會休息室中。盡力遊說，以糾正對蘇聯和平攻勢之過份信任心理及因此而造成之局勢。一般相信衆院所通過之各項削减費用中，有一部份已無恢復原狀之望，蓋縱使參院議決維持原來數額，其最後結果亦祇能就參衆兩院核准之數目中，成立折衷辦法，援外數額削减後之後果，不止一端，最主要者即爲對於以馬歇爾方案爲基礎的美國外交政策之影響。馬歇爾固已表示削减以後將使復興方案僅成救濟計劃，目前在議會區所見到之許多議員，表情均甚嚴肅，顯示對於削减援外費之重視。由於共和黨全代大會將於六月廿一日在費城開會，選舉候選總統，故國會開會日期已甚匆促，料局勢如陷入嚴重狀態，已出發赴全國作巡迥競選演講之杜魯門，可能趕回親自向國會發表警告。對外貿易協定案　期限應予延長　馬歇爾顧問發表意見　　馬歇爾顧問發表意見　　〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕馬歇爾國務卿之特別經濟顧問前副國務卿克萊登在參院財委會中作證，鄭重警告不可接受已經衆院通過對對外貿易協定法案所加之若干限制。指出此等限制將殺害前國務卿赫爾手創之互惠貿易計劃。克氏懇切籲請參院財委會推翻衆院所已通過限制該法案之延長至多一年，及限制總統與他國談判减低關稅協定之權等項決議。渠要求維持政府所要求之三年延長期。指出接受馬歇爾援助之十六國中，有奧義葡希丹愛爾蘭諸國尙未與美訂立互惠貿易協定，如僅延長一年，決不及一一締結。越南臨時政府　加入法聯邦　胡志明指斥為傀儡政府　　〔聯合社河內五日電〕法國贊助之越南臨時中央政府，已於本星期六在海防附近之法國軍鸛上宣布成立，由法國高級專員波拉爾，安南遜王保大及臨時政府總理阮文春簽訂條約，承認加入法蘭西聯邦。保大宣讀臨時政府成立佈告，其黃色綉紅龍之帝國旗，同時飄揚於法國三色旗及臨時政府黃色紅條　之新國旗旁。保大本人之身份尙未明瞭，雖被稱爲陛下，但未列入新政府內。胡志明領導之越南政府則稱，此新政權爲傀儡政府。　　新政府名單　　〔中央社河內六日電〕越南臨時中央政府頃已組成，今下午五時在黎利　堂宣誓就職，新政府之名單如次：主席兼國防都長阮文春，副主席，南圻省長陳文克，，北圻省長嚴春善，中圻省長潘元敎，宣傳部長潘輝旦，財政部長阮忠永，公共衛生部長鄧友治，靑年體育部長阮科全，靑年體育部次長偃春斥，內政部長阮克智，國防部次長陳光榮，司法部長阮克衛，農業部長陳天宏，公共工程部長阮文司，主任秘審丁春光。在越華僑恢復邦會舊制　我政府向法抗議　聲明一切後果應由法負責　　〔中央社河內六日電〕此間法駐北圻專員狄高氏，今日下午正式宣佈自即日起，恢復華僑帮公所制度，並已同時公佈各地華僑帮公所負責人選，此舉與南圻法方當局解散西貢堤岸區各中華總會，並以組識非法團體罪名控訴各中華總會負責人事，似爲同一性質。按在越華僑組織方式問題，爲中法外交縣案之一，刻仍在談判中。月前法方在談判獲致結果前，先採片面行動，顯欲造成事實，恢復戰前舊制。我政府以法方不顧其歷次諾言，採取單方行動，已於今日提出書面抗議，並聲明一切後果應由法方負責。東南亞英專員稱決防止共黨活動　　〔聯合社新加坡六日電〕英國駐東南亞特派員麥唐納今夜廣播演說稱，現有一種徵象，證明國際共產主義領袖已決定在歐洲受挫時，在亞洲發動政治攻勢。共黨煽動者正迫切嘗試在馬來區域之田園礦穴與工廠實施刀槍統治。渠等此類之遝動必須加以撲滅。按上月份馬來橡膠園工廠與錫礦曾發生工潮。諾曼第戰役四周年　英法兩國隆重舉行紀念　互相勗勉繼續保持團結　　〔路透社巴黎六日電〕在國際緊張局勢未减的今天，法國全國人民紀念二次世界大戰轉捩點的諾曼第登陸四週耙念日，尤具有特別情感。法總統歐禮和偕英美大使親赴諾曼第海濱憑弔，向英美加陳亡戰士之墓獻花圈。總統並赴法北部之加恩城，該地爲英國及加拿大軍登陸戰中犧牲最重之地·巴黎聖母堂舉行特別追思彌撒，巴黎無名英雄墓前堆滿不少花圈，以點綴四年前此一驚天動地之戰役。杜魯門抵奧瑪哈　演講農業重要性　　〔聯合社尼勃拉斯加奧瑪哈五日電〕杜魯門總統出巡西部各州，今日在此間農業區演說，主張扶助農業，確保美國農村未來福利，大要與其五月十四日向國會提出之法案相同。　　〔合衆社奧瑪哈五日電〕杜魯門總統今日出席第卅五師團聯歡會發表演說稱，美國決竭力促使聯合國克奏膚功。渠稱，二次大戰後，美國走上新途徑，而不蹈第一次大戰後之覆轍，蓋其時參議院中目光短視者，阻止吾人參加國際聯盟，美國始終受其累。故吾人現下應警惕，不使第一次大戰後之悲劇重演。　　〔中央社尼勃拉斯加州俄馬哈五日電〕杜魯門到達此一向孤立之中西部後，其「非政治性」之橫貫大陸旅行、已一轉爲備極鄭重之政治活動。渠本人更有信心，可於十一月之選舉中再度當選。渠每至此五州中之一州，即要求人民助其連任。杜魯門此行，獲得熱烈歡迎，而直接向美人從事自我宣傳之工作，亦似成功。自其旅行之初步階段所獲反響言之，其聲望顯已增高，然究能獲得何種成就，尙須拭目以觀。維持中間派力量　法揆決繼續任職　　〔中央社巴黎五日合衆電〕據聞法總理許曼，決定在任何代價下，至少維持其「第三力量」政府，繼續當權至本年十月，以避免共黨與戴高樂派間之衝突。　　〔路透社倫敦六日電〕今日爲盟軍登陸諾曼第之四週年紀念，英國各地敎堂均舉行宗敎儀式、追思四年前壯烈犧牲之勇士。在樸資茅斯海軍基地所建紀念該次戰役之陣亡蝟軍廿五萬五千人紀念碑，亦適於今日由英帝國參謀消除自私心理　覓取國際諒解　　歐禮和向列強呼籲　　〔路透社巴黎六日電〕法總統歐禮和昨在諾曼第之安貝森要塞發表演說，呼籲二次世界大戰勝利之盟國保持團結，並履行其每國之任務。歐禮和於述及盟軍及法國抗戰勇士之豐功偉蹟後，並曰，「吾人必須恢復五年抗戰中盟國一致舉行之原則，及大西洋憲章聯合國憲章之原則。此等原則，要求各國履行其任務，實爲防止猜忌，恐懼及畏縮的最好保障。吾人固知造成目前局勢的責任，在於各國之自私心理，此等心理已俁解近代世界的革命，及其個別利益與眞正獨立間的區別。職是之故，法國準備基於互惠的原則，限制一部份主權以確保國際安全，如設立國際安全軍及由國際管制工廠以及實驗室中所生產之武器等。吾人相信如能承認網際秩序公理及繁榮的需要，並抱有成功的意志，則月前之任何爭端均不難解決。法閱有關慮其本身及世界各國安全之義務，法國有權取得其合法的賠價，亦有權宣布任何不顯其警告及經驗的國際政策之危險性。法國對於此等國際政策最爲敏感，法國有權要求不使昨日之敵成爲勝利國之敵，亦有權要求勝利國互相協議並履行其義務。阿猶停僵局　貝那多特正分并沒有訪晤阿猶首腦　移民問題猶方不願讓步　　〔路透社倫敦六日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦斡旋專員貝那多特，今晨離開羅赴海發，再與以色列外長薛托克會談。貝氏與薛氏晤談畢於今夜將再飛外約但首都阿曼，與阿拉伯聯盟領袖晤談，然後重飛開羅，研究今日洽談之結果，而決定最後的行動計劃。　　同時巴勒斯坦英軍司令麥克密倫中將軍，亦於今日離海發赴蘇　士運河區與英國高級官員會談，預料在會談中將決定關於執行休戰之計劃，向貝那多特提出建議。在軍事方面，各綫戰事賡續未已，惟雙方之地位，並無顯著變更。　　〔路透社倫敦五日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦斡旋專員貝那多特，五日在開羅與埃總理諾克拉莤會談九十分鐘，以覓取堪爲猶阿雙方接受之休戰公式，貝氏此外又與聯合國耶路撒冷市專員伊文斯及聯合國巴勒斯坦委會秘書處之彭趣晤談，貝氏在開羅洽談畢，又赴貝魯特與黎巴嫰當局接治，渠於抵貝魯特時似甚樂觀，表示猶阿雙方有接受其休戰條件之望。據悉，目前癓結仍在移民問題，安理會已將此事交貝氏全權決定。緣阿拉伯方面堅持須先停止移民入巴勒斯坦始願接受休戰計劃，而猶方則持異議。安理會原定昨日開會討論在休戰期內是否得許猶太及齡壯丁進入巴勒斯坦之問題，臨時突又取消，授權貝那多特決定。貝氏苟能調和猶阿就移民問題之意見，而不勞安理會續開辯論，則貝氏即可被認爲得以完成巴勒斯坦最後解決之適當人選。　　〔合衆社成功湖五日電〕以色列發言人五日談稱，除非阿拉伯對阻延停戰開始之移民糾紛問題有所讓步，巴勒斯坦停戰之機會將遭受「嚴重之打擊」。渠堅特聯合國安理會停戰計劃所特別規定之，祇需不加訓練與動員，軍役年齡之男子得在停戰期內移入巴勒斯坦一節。目前猶太方面對此點似無接受折衷辦法之希望，可能僅同意在緩和之速度下，移入軍事年齡之男子。小型大會工作　着重調處爭端　　推進國際合作已獲進展　　〔中央社成功湖六日電〕美出席聯合國小型大會代表吉思普，今日稱：小型大會在推進國際合作一般原則之工作方面已獲實際進展，且已改進和平處理爭端之方法。按小型大會之十五國小組委員會，刻正研究如何將聯合國憲章中所定之國際政治性合作原則，付諸實施。吉氏對該會工作發表一項聲明其中特別提出中美所共同提出之建議案，照此項建議，應提出一批有資望人士，而由各會員國或聯合國，自其中挑選若干人參加調查，或和解委員會之工作。吉氏復稱：小型大會，刻從事之另一項工作，為研究如何以談判調停，和解仲裁，法一律解決等方式，和平解決爭端·按由小型大會研究上列諸問題，乃出自我代表徐淑希本年一月之建議。美人民七年來　多浮噪不安　　七千萬人喬遷頻繁　　〔合衆社紐約五日電〕據美國統計局所發表之數字，美國人民在過去七年中較以前任何時期爲浮躁不安。據政府之統計有七千萬人（幾及美國人口之半數）自一九四〇年至一九四七年中喬遷新居，其中二千五百萬人自一國遷居另一國家，或由一州遷至另一州。大部份調動情形係移向西部，西部諸州增加人口二百萬

<p>一般物價　美援消減消息　刺激商品勝漲　　行憲後政院首揆自任命翁文灝氏以後組閣工作積極推進，政院各部會首長，已於六月一日全部發表，當前政府各項經濟措施，因時勢之推移，已不盡適用，改革之說，醞釀已久，上週亦隨組閣工作之趨於明朗而漸露端倪。如（一）改善外匯管理政策，採用結匯證明書辦法，（二）當日票據不能抵用之實行，（三）國庫券上市開拍等，均屬犖犖大者。此項變革對於一般物價之影響，自屬至深且鉅，但結果如何，必待付諸實施以後，由於事實的演變，才遂漸明白表現。　　上週市塲情形，週初尙稱平穩，週五以後，因美衆院撥款會建議美政府普遍削减援外經費一案，我國部份减少六千三百萬元，運用日期延長至十五個月，消息傳來，物價一致騰漲。銀根方面，除週一二因當日票據不抵用關係，突呈緊俏外，當局仍秉一貫方針，從各種角度多方設法以達到抽緊的目的，但外埠游資流滬，國庫支出浩繁，終不免有心無力之感，國行交換情形，週二三兩日均各差出一千餘億。暗息徘徊於二角九分至三角四五之間，港匯於週一以四角六收盤，週二三放長至五角餘，後回縮至四角六原盤。上週政府各項經濟措施，重點不盡一致，其有關抽緊銀根，抑平物價者，約不外下列數端。　　第一，繼續拋售物資。週一紡建公司代紗管會標售棉紗八種，售出一八三件，棉花二種，一，一一五祖。週二續代售棉紗十一種，售出二二七件，棉花一種，二〇〇担。週三售棉紗十二種，六一六件，棉花四種，一，三〇〇担。週四售棉紗十二種，一，一六七件，棉花四種，一，六六〇担，龍頭細布七，〇八〇疋，價每疋六八〇萬。週五售棉紗十一種，售出一，一七八件，棉布三種，七，四〇三疋，棉花三種，二，八三五担。週末售棉紗十一種，售出五五四件，棉花二種，一，九〇〇担，棉布三種，三，六一〇疋。惟據報載，經濟部以紗管會存底無多，曾令飭停止拋售，市價頗有因此上揚之勢。　　糧食方面，由於前週之管制市塲，實施限價，塲內交易，已無形陷於停頓狀態，僅有塲外喊價而已，上週食米恢復自由買賣，民調會同時宣告停止拋售，塲內交易復趨正常，此項措施，我們從糧食的來源上看，今後可望增加，從價格上看，似乎是失去了管制，結果如何，事實會給我們答覆的。　　此外中信局於上週拋售麵粉頗多，每包售價一九八萬元，對於粉價的平抑，不無功效。　　第二，關於出售短期國庫券一舉，國行自四月三十日發售以來，截至最近爲止，據估計已售出共約二萬五千億元，對於抽緊銀根，多少不無功效。上週復增發兩個月期之庫券，於週一起，在公開市塲買賣，第一日共成交六百九十七億元，甲種以七十二元八角收盤，乙種以七十三元五角收盤，合息六十天單利約爲二角二分餘。　　第三，遷延已久的禁止票據當日抵用問題，已於六月一日實施，上海金融管理局負責人再發表談話；「一，票據當日不抵用，僅指支票而言，其餘不票保付支票曁合法匯票，均不在此限制範圍以內。二，即以支票而論，亦非當日支票一律不能抵用，其經收妥或經照票無訛者，自仍得以隨時抵用；故其問題厥在收兌與否而不在是否當。」此種辦法，若就取締不正當票據，保障金融業安全而言，尙不無理由，若想藉此以减少通貨流通速度，防止信用擴張，以達到穩定物價的目的，那是很有問題的。　　此外政府在上週的新措施，要以改善外匯管　辦法，採用結匯證明書制爲最引人注目的一件大事了。這個新辦法共有三十一條款，要點約爲（一）中央銀行之指定銀行對於出口商所得外匯，審核無誤後，發給出口結匯證明書，對於原幣匯人匯款（包括華僑，外國政府，敎會，慈善機關及其他之匯款）及在國內之外國貨幣，審核無誤後發給特種結匯證明書。（二）結匯證朋書須於背書後始得轉讓於領有許可證之合格買主。（三）結匯證明書之有效期間，自發行之日起，以七日爲限不得展期。（四）結匯證明書價格由買賣雙方決定之。各方對於新辦法的反應，頗爲良好，因爲新辦法能避免許多過去的弱點而能達到推進出口與吸收僑匯的兩大目的。週三起結匯證明書在市塲中已有成交，計一美元三十七萬五千元，加外匯基準價四十七萬四千元，合為八十四萬九千元。　　關於美援運用問題，益見具體，我方除已由行政院設立美援物資運用委員會員專管之責外，美方對於撥款用途，亦已明白規定，據合衆社息，撥款委員會所通過之援華款項，規定四億六千三百萬美元之二千五百萬美元由中國政府隨意使用，其餘三億三千八百萬美元中以六千萬美元用於復興計劃，餘下二億七千八百萬美元之運用爲：購買米麥八五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇；棉花七二，五〇〇，〇〇〇元；石油及石油產物六五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元；肥田粉二四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元；烟草一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元；現有資本設備之替換品二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元；執行費用一，五〇〇，〇〇〇元。　　但週五據路透社息，美衆院撥款會建　美政府普遍削减援外經費，援華額减至四億元，較原案少六千三百萬元，並將運用日期延長至十五個月。吾人感於當前經濟危機的嚴重，美援物資得來的不易，不得不鄭重呼籲當局，應如何善爲運用，庶使此有限的物資，發生最大的效果。　　上週市塲物價走勢，在前述因素支配下，大抵週初趨跌，週中盤升，週末　漲。花紗布市場方面，紗管會雖不斷拋售，但因售價逐步提升，兼之經濟部有令飭停售之說，週五復右美援削减之刺激，市價在不斷上揚中，如四十二支藍鳳由週二之二億八千八百萬漲至週末之三億四千四百萬，廿一支雙馬由週二之二億零五百萬漲至週末之二億五千八百萬，龍頭細布週五曾創七百七十四萬之新高價，後以七百四十五萬收盤，週末破八百萬關，再創新高價。　　食米市場，上週恢復自由買賣，市價在高峯盤旋，南北兩市塲上白粳價，週末均在七百萬元上下。食油市氣頗秀，如育島吉桶生油由週初之一千八百萬　漲至週末之一千九百餘萬。麵粉因中信局拋貨關係，價在穩檔徘徊。日用品如肥皂火柴等，因實銷頗暢，價均堅挺。餘如化學品金屬等，已於前週漲登高位，上週走勢尙穩，週末因受金融性各物價格麗漲之新刺激，有再度上揚之勢　　上週批發物價指數按用途分類者以次：　　上週批發物價指數按加工程度分類者如次：　　上週批發物價指數按產銷國別分類者如下：貨幣金融　　（一）銀根暗息　　上週本市銀根，初頗受當日票據不能抵用的影響；雖然市間頭寸供源尙甚，而國家行局又反進爲出，但終以週轉不靈，銀根稍感緊歛。週中以後當日票據不能抵用已漸漸習慣，而且本票使用，益見普遍，外埠資金亦續有抵達，於是銀根又見全面鬆和之趨勢。就業內外而論，業內銀根始終遠較業外爲鬆，爲應付票據當日抵用，業內放款即暫告停頓，因之存單豐厚，頭雨鬆濫，商業行莊一週來同業拆放未見做開，亦即以此故。但就業外言，所受票據不能抵用的影響可不小，貨帮支付，多以現鈔或本票爲工貝，普遍缺單，其勢甚顯，一般預料，本市銀根，在端節前後，大致尙可維持一穩定的局面。　　自週一至週五，國家行局交換結果，雖尙差進一萬八千一百三十一億，但如扣除同期內商業銀行於央行的存款計二萬〇五百億，則國家行局尙有二千三百六十九億之差出，較前週减進達一萬三千七百四十七億之鉅。　　洋商銀行自週一至週五共差進一萬二千一百二十八億，較前週同期內减進一千九百四十五億。近幾週來洋商銀行减進之趨勢，當與游資南流已近飽和點以及華南物價高於本市有關。　　商業行莊方面，六十號以後者自週一至週五交換結果共差出達一萬一千四百九十九億，較前週竟减出二萬餘億，由此可見上週銀根已較前週爲鬆。至於行莊解繳央行之現鈔五天來數在一千二百億左右，週初因當日票據開始禁止抵用，現鈔支付頻繁，故解繳央行之現鈔减少，但週四以後，因市間現鈔籌碼鬆濫，其數又增加。　　上週暗息，以週三爲最高，做三角三分至三角六分，週三以前，大致在三角與三角一分半間，週五低見二角七分，銀根全面轉和的跡象畢露。證券帮塲外貼息，多方貼出週一週五均爲三十六元，週三四升至四十元，空方貼進週三四亦高見三十六元，週一週五較低，做三十二元。　　（二）內外匯率　　上週本市內匯行市，商業銀行之匯水普見下降，穗匯匯水週一·二爲五十元，週三落十元，週四再降二十元，週五則稍升仍爲四十元，厦匯匯水自週一之一百四十元迭降至週五之一百元，渝匯本爲平匯，但週四起竟改爲貼水二十元，漢匯匯水週一週二爲十元，後改爲平匯，津匯貼水亦自一百元减爲八十元，種種跡象，似說明資金之南流已告和緩，據說此種現象並不表示內地之幣値已見穩定，而是由於華南游資已達飽和，其物價與本市呈倒懸所造成。　　上週外匯行市，週初有結匯新辦法之公佈，基準率仍維持原價，計美匯爲四十七萬四千元，「結匯證明書」價格週二喊六十萬元，但無做開，週三以後跌至三十六七萬元左右，亦以商人多抱觀望態度而少成交。香港申匯受新政策影響，亦見疲落，週二一度放長爲五角三分，後見回縮，週四與週一價同，仍爲四角六分。香港美鈔市價在五元五角二分與六七分之間。　　（三）華洋股市　　週初有三樁大事：當日票據不能抵用，短期庫券上市，以及外匯改訂結　證明書辦法；俱傳華股市塲發生或多或少的影響。昨日恰逢月杪，生活指數發表，約增四成許，而且銀根頗緊，人心恍惚，市况凄淸，均持觀望，多頭因利息高昂，略有了結，各股一致　疲，臨收永紗勉站二千穴百關，信和做八三〇元，美亞以三五〇〇元成交，新光三二，景福十六，供形軟弱。週二更呈盤降，實因支票禁止當日抵用，遂使市塲交易須多負一日利息與頭寸，股市頗形窘迫、走勢下游，永紗竟破進二千五百關。週三因銀根轉鬆，突呈反動，百物告挺，華股亦見激漲，永紗躍登二千九百關，華豐，新光，華新，閘北，大通均漲停板，成交額達十八億股以上。週四，銀根雖鬆，新買仍存觀望，無非隔昨　漲，遂鮮起色，終日盤旋，上落幅度不大。周五以外埠游資勇到，銀根益鬆，外象續漲，一致回昂，永紗曾見三一七〇元，臨收爲三一三〇元，信和爲一〇一二元，新光三人·五〇元，景福爲一九·三〇元。週末繼此種趨勢之後，仍極堅俏，永紗曾高見三二三。元以三一九五元收盤，他股亦漲多跌少。　　週初外股市况，因外匯政策變動，大戶捉摸不定，都呈觀望，且市上銀根奇緊，各股遂均告下落，交易亦淸，怡紗四三七萬買進，英聯爲四六五萬，會德豐叩九百萬關。週二仍見平疲，蓋以港匯平定，黑市亦跌之故，怡紗挫至四二三萬，英聯做四六〇萬，會德豐平穩，其他啤酒，鋼業，紙版，業廣等股，均稍盤挫。周三因銀根轉鬆，復露秀色，英聯漲勢較猛，爲五一〇萬，會德豐盤旋一千萬左右，怡紗經廣帮大量吸納，升至四五一萬。週四港匯雖見緊縮，但人心均特觀望，市况頗見平定，惟業廣因有利多消息，傳其資產將改以美金計算，反形上漲，一二五萬成交頗多。週五漲風再起，怡紗挺見四八九萬，英聯爲五六〇萬，會德豐一一五〇萬元有買進，業廣升十三萬元。週末因港匯報縮，賡續上升，怡紗以五一五萬收，較上日升二十六萬元，英聯較上日升三十萬元，會德豐升五十萬元</p>

<p>科學電波和宇宙  鋼人　　科學發展到今日，不但把人類的生活多所改適，更使那些務常易於被人視爲神秘的理論，實踐起來，產生了令人驚奇的事實。即使是天文物理學，也並不例外。相反地，正有着許多關係我們這世界的知識，例如見於星體的原子分裂，終在地球上人們的手中實現，正是一個最明顯的實證。　　於是人們覺得努力探測宇宙，革新舊有的觀念，正是値得化費了人力物力來追求的。而工具和方法，當然是一切研究工作的前提了。　　自從人類開始了數千年的宇宙探測，都是應周他的自然賦予的眼睛。這顯是失常的不可靠。直到伽利略（Galileo）把望遠　介紹給我們以後，也祇是把圓的天體，星球和月亮，在一鏡子一裏栘得近一點而已，觀察依舊是肉眼的。當然免不了糢糊和無從所認的感覺。　　在最近的前一世紀，科學家們才用分光鏡來分析由星體放射出來的光成爲一種光譜，雖然這種光譜給他們不少帮助，然而在澈底了解星體組織上，還是不夠的。　　最近，由於無綫電池研究的驚人進展，無綫電波收送器也就被擴展應用於天文學上，在許多不十分可靠的儀器中作爲一件最新的工具。　　一九二九年，美國物理學家瓊斯（U．J．Jansky）他從超短波無綫電接收器裏聽到了一茲茲」的雜聲，而提出研究這瞟被他認爲來自其他星球的聲音。　　許多科學家和他繼續研究這一問題，而獲得初次的結論，說是那些聲音的來源，就是銀河系（Milby　way）的星球。　　這時，在美國的阿博登爵十（Sir　Edwards　Appleton）海亦（J．S．Hey)也發現了許多强力的騷擾是從太陽黑點而來。太陽黑點正是一個最强力的超短渡電台，他有着相當於一百萬　的電力。　　最近召開的英國科學協進會（Brltish　Assoclation　tor　theAdvanceucen　　of　Science）中阿博登爵士提出了他的一九四六年報告，指出太陽黑點的變化和地球上一切無綫電的詳細關係。　　現在，許多科學家都已相信，環斯所發現的「宇宙雜音」可能是從「星體黑點一上來的。」　　然而怎樣解釋這些宇宙「雜音」的一切，我們的電波研究，還是一個不完美的科學，缺少實驗和記錄，但把電波應用到宇宙研究上，毋疑將使人們明白更多的事務。　　一般相信宇宙綫和宇宙「雜音」沒有關係，也有少數的科學家認爲來自同一源流。這許多蘇聯和美國的科學家正在積極地研究着。　　很明顯的，我們的肉眼，衹見到一些極小的宇宙，同樣眼球也不能爲我們分析放射光爲光譜，這裏用了分光鏡來補充，使我們能從那裏研究星體所含的各種物質。狄們的眼球，對於一宇宙雜首一史是無從接受了。然而有了無綫電彼接收器，他把電磁能　換成了耳膜共震的聲音，送入我們的耳中；人類已把智慧和工具　緊起來了。　　所以進一步的研究宇宙，是需要憑籍這些工具和方法的。在美國和英國正在無綫電探測宇宙上作極大的努力，雷　的研究和　用正是一個美麗的揷曲：因爲他們知道從這些騷擾了寗靜的雜普正包含着不少的眞理，將來不但作爲已有理論的佐證，且將產生新的發現。　　如果說冶金學家能從地球物質的研究，　着了最優美的材料，帶來了人類的幸福，一個在馬可尼以前的蘇聯科學家鮑卜夫（Baport）所提出的一無綫電訊一，止被實用地聯繫着人們的信息和　情，爲什麼于文學的宇宙研究又不可能　？　　因此，瓊斯爵士所首先聽到的刺耳雜昔　和用無綫電波作爲　　工具的一些問題，就不單是在天文科學上是極重要的了。最大的望遠鏡  李中浣　　世界最大的天文望遠鏡，是一具二百吋的迴光望遠　，裝置在美國南加利福尼亞聖地雅哥郡的巴洛馬山（Mount　Palorman）。這座二有吋的遠鏡，能破收集比以前成爾孫山上一有吋望遠鏡四倍的星光，距離超過兩倍。它能看到十萬光年以外的宇宙空間（約合五·八六五·六九六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇哩）。它架在一個直徑一百三七呎的座基上，重達五百磅。工程師們用盡方法，把牠裝置得精巧靈活，因此一只拳頭大的馬達，就可以使牠轉動自如。　　遠在十八年前，天文學家赫怕爾（E．P．Hubble）利用一百吋的望遠鏡測量逐漸黯淡的星雲，得到一個科學界所未曾有的結論。他以爲整個的字宙是在礦展之中。　　天文學有一種速度儀，用以測量星球運動的情形。星光經望遠鏡對準後，由稜鏡分析成光譜。當這條光謂較正常的情形更紅時，就表　這星球離地更遠，這個現象叫一紅移」。赫帕爾發現光　有紅移的現象時，足球離去的速度加大。他的結論是：星雲引退的速度和他們的距離成正比　　據赫帕爾的發現，二億五千萬光年以外的星雲以較光速還要大八分之一的驚人速度在在逃。這個學說引起許多科學家的反對，因爲愛因斯坦的相對論（物理學的最高法則）說宇宙間任何物不能以比光更快的速度移動。百吋遠鏡使赫帕爾發現字宙在擴展中，可是也產生許多不能答復的問題。這需要二百吋的遠鏡來解決。　　一九二八年時洛克　勒基金團就答應他製造這個遠鏡，可是沒有一個廠家能定造五百噸的大玻臻磚。一九三六做透鏡用的彼磚終於運到了加州理工大學的巴　登那光學工廠進行琢磨。還不曾完工，太平洋戰事發生。赫帕爾只得把工作暫定，去參加戰時工作。　　戰後，他軍返光學工廠。在他的　督下，這個精細萬分的琢　工作，逐部進行。這個銳而要成拋物綫型。精確程度要達二百萬分之一吋。參觀的人不准穿靴人內，因爲一粒沙子就可以破壤幾個月的琢磨工作。一九四六年八月這鏡子終於完工。　　天文學家在山上夜間工作，日裏可以在遁　避光的臥室中補足睡眠。　　（關於紅移和擴展中的宇宙的理論，可參閱中國科學圖書儀器公司的王普譯的的「老朱夢游物理世界」，比較其他各書爲明暸）。電視之用途  瞿友仃　　電視（Television，或名無綫電傳眞）是近世電學界之一大進步，其所予人類之福利，較之　綫電者更大；按此種遠方物像電眏術之方法，乃爲英人JoilnL．Ba　Id氏所發明，至今已有多年，今則蒸蒸日上，發展頗速。　　電視除可作家庭娛樂之用外，尚有許多正常而重要之用途，茲略述之。　　通常潛海人員潛入水中探測，至多只能深至兩百呎左右，但利用電視，則可將我們的祖綫伸展至更深而無何危險。此法可將一電視顯影機置入一厚金屬壁之測量筒內，由）觀察船　放入水中，沉至海洋深處；於是測量人員即可安坐於甲板之上，如技術　明者，數小時即可完成其觀測之任務。對電視顯影機而言，只需較堅厚之筒壁以抵抗水深處之壓力即可，旣不需供氣，又不怕六百呎深處之近於零點之溫度。此種水下電視可助海中救護及水中撈打工作之進行，可指示海底汕井鑿孔之適當地位；其下沉之深度，僅與筒壁厚度所能承受之壓力大小限度有關。　　玻璃熔爈及　礦熔爐中之熔化實情，一向無人得知，因其執一度過高，測量其高溫時，亦須用一光學高溫計在一相當距離外量度；觀察時須戴特製之黑色保護目　，且僅　唱問一馳而已，若稍一挨近即將盲目焦膚·但若在　內適宜之　裝一電視顯影機時，則可將熔化物熔化之情形眏入廠方辦公室工程師之眼中，工程師可以從頭五尾觀察，一如旅行於爐內。爐內火光四射之金扁或玻　，司供給　影之充足光度，顯　機本身則可以特製之冷劑液體　以防其被火所毀。將來如發展　于相當程度時，可能使，工廠各　均有電視之裝置，以便集中管　控制，保障生命安全，促進出　　質地之優　及產量之增加。　　電視之繼續發展，　將使敎育制度完全改觀，必要時講堂上之黑板將改成電視屏，其中尤以醫科學校等更有此需要。　　娛樂方面，在美國已漸普遍，全國各地之電視設備，總數常在十萬座以上，而聯絡放射站則已足够用。惟其播送範團，目前尙只及以四十至六十哩爲半徑之圓圈地域之內。通常標準之電視播送站，每日有數小時之播送時間，節目多爲運動塲上之球賽，角力，劵術及戲院幕情等等。　　前面所述，冬指黑白二彩之電視而言，近來更有令彩色（Full　Color）電視之發明；一年以前即有美國哥倫比亞廣播公司作此宣稱，謂利用與雷達波相同之超高率波，可得較黑白二彩更爲明亮淸白之全彩電視，嗣後繼續發展，終必成功。此種彩色之傅送，全係一種電子傳送，設備中之轉動部分，已爲光電池及反光鏡所代替；發射處有一發射陰極射綫管，此管所發之射綫，經過稜鏡及色彩軟汽而至光電池及反光鏡，然後發出一道光綫，分成紅綠藍等色象射出。而收受器方面則有三個分色鏡，同時收受各種色象，藉螢光　及反光　之作用而顯影。　　彩色電視波之頻率較黑白二彩所需者爲高，其他如發射率，稜鏡數目，圖片重覆率（每秒三十次）等均與以前所用者相當，是以只須用一周波頻率變換器，即可將一黑白二彩之電視收受器改裝成爲有色彩者。夏天避熱法  留宜　　每到夏季，熱浪來製，這對於我們的工作效率，减退殊多。科學家雖然發明了種種避熱取凉方法和設備像電扇，冷氣之如，都是人們所熟知的，不過這些設備，多限於大餐館，電影院，銀行，大公司以及富有之家，大多數人是無福亨受的。炎天暑熱，驕陽可畏，蟄居斗室，如處　籠，的確令人煩悶。　　近來美國依理諾愛大學（Ltltnols　Unlversity）工程學院，設有住宅避熱研究實　室，專以研究一般中下階級人民住屋的如何避然爲目的，實騐室中有特種熱氣管，和冷氣管的設備，用以試驗在冬天如何可以增加溫度，在　天如何可以减低溫度，研究的對象是大多數人住的普通房屋。據實驗研究所得，其右效而易行的方法，是自下午六時至次日上午六時，把住宅的窗戶儘量打開，反之在白天則將窗戶多多關閉。換句話說，在晚上議冷空氣流入，保留爲白天之用，再在晚間將頂樓的門窗打開，這樣形成自然的空氣流通肉，可以把日間室內低層的熱空氣漸漸向外流出，到白天復行關閉，使室內的冷空氣不致流出。至於再想舒週的，　將各門窗曬太陽的三方面，都支以帳幕，如此，可减少熱浪的侵入。據實驗結果，有帳幕和沒有帳幕的住宅，凉熱的相差，可達百分之二十到三十，也就是室內和室外的溫度相差百分之二十到三十。這看上去是老生常談，沒有什麼大道理，可是按照實行起來，那你就獲得避熱的實益了。並且，這個方法，是簡而易行，不費一文的。科學新聞抗酸玻璃  劉遂生　　氣氟酸能以腐蝕玻璃，凡習化學者，類多知悉。因此貯存氫氟酸，通常用橡皮瓶或蠟瓶。但今日能將氟較盛於　璃瓶中，不惟當　絕們變化，即經三週之久，亦不顯腐蝕之象其故安在　　氫氟酸能與普通仄璃主成分之砂起化學　用，　致遭腐蝕；新發明的「防　玻璃」的主成分，大都係五　化二磷。　　此種新　璃，適當研究原子炸彈，處理另種侵蝕玻璃的六氟化　時，面由美國光學公司所發明云。　　（附註）（一）氣氟酸係由　　螢石（氟化鈣）加濃硫酸而製得：　　CaF2+H2SO4—CaSO4+H2F2（氣氟酸）。　　（二）氟酸腐蝕普通玻璃之理：　　3H2F2+Na2SiO3（玻璃）—2NaF+SiF4　+3H2O。　　氟化鈉即NaF溶於水中；氟化矽即SiF4呈氣體逸去。　　（三）五氣化二燐·（P2O5）可由燃嫾而生成。　　（四）普通玻璃係由碳酸鈉（Na2CO3）加砂（SiO2所製成。昆虫的生長激素  郝天和　　昆虫體內激素的存在和她們的作用，雖然一般人一向對之抱着懷疑態度，但是經魏革溫斯（Elggt　warth）及魏德（Weed）等昆虫學家的研究，現在已經被大家所公認了，而且還成立了一門新的科學，呌做昆虫內分泌學（Insect　Endoorlnology）。目前研究的人大都集中下列三方面：（一）顏色激素，（二）因基控制激素的作用，（三）生長邊素，此文僅就第三項概述之，　　昆虫的胚胎後期，還有一套發育的程序，昆虫經過幼虫而羽化爲成虫，這個現象稱爲變態（Metatnorphosis，有些昆虫自幼虫直接變爲成虫，有的自幼虫變成虫中間還須經過蛹期，前一類的變態雖說是漸變的，然在最後一次蛻皮時在形熊方面的改變，和以前的幾次蛻皮大不相同，後一類變熊，在每一階段的改變，都很顯著，這兩類變熊在生理上和步驟上是一致的，只是在時間上和程度上稱　其趣罷了　　在昆虫體內的生長激素可以分成兩種：（一）蛻皮激素（Moutlng　hormone）；（二）變態激素（Metamorphlc　Hormone）。　　蛻皮激素—昆虫的蛻皮有一定的時期，所以齡期也多半有一定，由於這種激索的分泌，可以使昆虫的幼虫蛻皮，例如在一些吸血的樁象（學名呌Rho　ntus）的發育期中，前四齡都要經過十二到十五日，而末一齡需經過二十八日，倘在每齡的前數日讓牠飽食之後，把牠的頭部切去，這樣很有效的可以防止她的蛻皮，而且有時這個無頭的樁象可以活到一年多，激素的分泌，有一定的期限，稱曰臨界期（Crtiel　perlod），這種吸血搏象的臨界期，前四齡爲飽貪，後四日，末齡爲飽食後七日，假若在臨界期以後，再去切頭，不能阻止蛻皮，因爲激素在昆虫體內的傳　是靠血液的循環，臨界期過後，激棄已被帶到身體（各部了，試把兩個切掉頭部的樁象，用一毛細管在牠們的頸部迎絡起來，然後再用　封回，如此能使一個已產生蛻皮激素的昆虫，把牠的激素由血液傾入另一個沒有產生蛻皮激素的昆虫體內，結果一樣也能令這個昆虫蛻皮，各齡所產生的蛻皮激素；性質和作川皆相同。所以四齡幼虫的血液，可以使一齡幼虫，也能使五齡幼虫蛻皮，更可以使　蛻過皮的吸血栯象，再蛻一次皮，　其　怪的是：蛻皮激素不受品種的限制，血緣相近的昆虫，能够彼此相互發生作用，所以吸血樁象可以令另一屬的樁象（Triatoma）蛻皮，就是和牠隸屬不同科的臭虫（Cimex）也可以使之蛻皮，蛻皮激素沒有種類差別，是很顯明的。　　另一種蛻皮激素發見在　翅目昆虫體內，有一些蛾（學名呌Lymantria）的幼虫變成蛹時，那次蛻乃就靠這種激素的作用，此蛾產生這種激素的臨界期，在末齡幼虫的七至十日間，在此期間，倘把這種蛾的末齡幼虫以刀切成或以細絲結爲前後兩半段，則前半段不久即會化蛹，後半段即令能活幾星期，仍不會起變化，若在十日後，再如前法分成兩半段，不久前後兩半段皆可化蛹，家蠶（Bombyxmori）成蛹的臨界期在停食以前，同樣有人川蠅（Callipilora）作試驗，當這種　要　蛹之前，用細絲或頭髮把末齡幼虫結成二段，倘在十二小時以內，則前後兩半段皆可成蛹，倘使在十二小時以前，則僅限前半化蛹，牠的臨界期，在成蛹前十二小時，要想把此蠅的後半段也化蛹，只要把前半部分的血液以注射方法，輸到後半　就可以了。最有趣的是不但把此蠅的血液輸進牠的幼虫體內，能引起幼虫早期變蛹，若使把蠟蛾（Galleria）幼蛹的血液或抽精取來輸入此蠅的幼虫體內，一樣能令牠的幼變虫蛹。　　這二種蛻皮素的分泌地方，可能由下列四處：第一個分泌激素的地方，可能是黃色細胞。在昆虫的表皮和基膜（Ba-sement　Membrane）之間，分散着一些呈黃色多葉的細胞，最先是由法渤氏（Fabre）發見，他名之曰黃色細胞。其實在多　昆虫皮層內皆爲無色。這種細胞增長的情形隨昆虫種類而異，在有些昆虫例如在有一屬昆虫（Thrixion）的幼虫體內黃色細胞，隨齡期而增大，第二齡爲第一齡的三倍，第三齡又約爲第二齡的二倍，在另一些昆虫的幼虫如在家蠶體內這種細胞均呈週期性增長。黃色細胞能分泌蛻皮激素，於家蠶體內能得到證明。當家蠶每次蛻皮時，皮內細胞特別膨大，而且也特別顯示活潑。反之倘這種細胞無變化，家蠶就不曾蛻皮第二個可能分泌蛻皮激素的地方大概是魏生氏腺（Verson＇s　Gland）。此線也生於表皮層中，老的角膜下，有細管通出，以利分泌素的排除，第三處爲側體（Corpora　allata）牠們是一對微小的白色腺體，位於幼蟲的小　與大顎之間，魏革溫斯用上述的吸血樁象作研究材料，發現此腺體的細胞在臨界期間特別賬大。最後一個可能分泌的地方爲昆蟲的腦，若將幼蟲的腦的割下，即不能化蛹。　　（二）變態激素—由於這種激素的存在，能阻止昆蟲的幼蟲或蛹羽化爲成蟲，這與前述的蛻皮激素的作用正相反，我們把吸血樁象的四齡幼蟲的血液輸到末齡幼蟲體內，能阻止牠們羽化，在各齡幼蟲的臨界期內，若將牠們的頭部割掉，大部可以使羽化，這證明各齡幼蟲期完全由變態激素所防止，否則且就變成成蟲了，這種變態激素也沒有品種的區別，分泌激素的器官亦爲側體（Cnrpora　allata），試將吸血樁象的第三齡或第四齡幼蟲的個體（Corpora　allata）割下，移植到末齡的幼蟲體內，就會產生一個巨大的幼蟲，而永不能羽化爲成蟲。</p>

<p>自由談羣衆與紀律  靖文　　看過了「靑春的旋律」與「大檢閱」兩片後，對於羣衆塲面的偉大，印象頗深。不過却有這樣一個感想，即這種步伐整齊的隊伍，以及一統的形式，美觀雖然是美觀極了，然而是否眞的表現了衆志成城的意義呢？這種看似偉大的塲面，是不是代表了個別自由意志的結合呢？　　我所以有這樣的疑問，是因爲在當初納粹當權的德國，那褐衫黨所表現的羣衆塲面，也曾有過同樣偉大整齊的彩式，就是墨索利尼治下，法西斯　人的「鵝步操」，也有它的特殊的形式美。這些在當時都曾被　傳過是羣衆力量的表現，是衆志所結成的長城。不過現在都已垮了。　　以上云云，並無偏見，祇是鄙意認爲紀律化的團結，終不若自由意志的幽結爲有力量。古代的斯巴達人便是最講紀律的一個民族，斯巴達人的社會中雖有貴族，平民，與奴隸之分，然而處在貴族地位的純粹斯巴達人，在嚴格的紀律訓練下，其生活之苦，簡實遠勝過他們所屬的平民與奴隸。現代的極左或極右的所謂「革命政權」，其領袖們的私生活，在未成功前，亦往往是極端刻苦自勵和講究「鐵的紀律」的。等到度取政權之後，這種「鐵的紀律便被用作御下的工具。因此所有的極權國家，在其極盛時代，在外象上往往表現得如鐵桶一般的團結，羣衆的力量，更被表現得如長城一般的堅固。希特勒生前在明興（慕尼黑）黨大會及歷次柏林羣衆大會中所搬弄的那套「偉大」塲面，當時眞不知迷過了多少人的耳目。　　和斯巴達人相比較，當時的雅典社會雖然也有貴族與奴隸之分，不過一個好似兵營，一個則如一座花園。斯巴達人除了西莫畢利一戰的可歌可泣的英雄悲劇外，在歷史上似乎禾曾留下甚麼。反之，雅典則不僅是希臘文化的搖籃，且亦是西歐哲學與文藝思想的發源地，是對於人類文明盡了偉大的貢獻的。　　話雖這樣說，但我絕無對「鐵的紀律」與羣衆的力量有絲毫輕視之意。因爲人必然是社會的動物，是不可能離羣而生的。而在一個羣的社曾中，一定的紀律是必要的。人類的社會文明發展到有成文或不成文的法律，就是表示了人類自身對於紀律的要求　　　在個別單位的團體中，紀律史是必要。不過紀律除了保持秩序的作用之外，最重要的是還能喚起一團體或一社會的成員彼此對道義的自覺，也就是一般所稱的責任心。這樣的紀律，就必須建築在個個份子的自由意志基礎之上，必須要使人理解：他所服從的紀律，不是一種外在的壓力，而是他對社會所訂的一種進義契約。也唯有這樣的紀律，才能發生眞的團結力量。　　曲解自由主義的人，每以爲自由就是散漫，就是沒有紀律，就是不能團結。可是歷史給我們的敎訓則幾乎完全相反。希特勒，墨索利尼以至日本軍國主義的一　人，過去就是抱着這種見解。他們所重視的紀律是「十誠」式的紀律，他們所重視的羣衆力量是褐衫黨或黑衫黨的整齊的力量形式。自由主羣的國家在他們目中是島合之衆、是不堪一擊的。這在戰爭開始之初，因爲英法等自由主義國家的屢屢敗北，更增加了他們這方面的自信。可是他們却沒有料到自由主義國家的人民居然也會有羣衆力量，也會有戰時國家的紀律，而且發揮了爲他們意想不到的效果。　　羣衆的力量是偉大的，紀律亦有約束的效果，不過若單靠紀律的約束去操縱羣衆的力量，而忽略了個人自由意志的發展，則遲早難免要重蹈希墨等人的覆轍，造成樹倒　猻散的悲劇結果。　　最後得聲明，本文僅爲個人對一般現象的感想，對所述及的兩影片毫無關係，不過借作引子而已。續海花作者燕谷老人  錢大成　　續　海花」之作者華谷老人，姓張氏，字隱南，號　　，別署蠻公，蠻巢居士，晚歲居燕園，因又自號燕谷老人，原名澂，常熟人。淸光緒甲辰進士，官外務部郎中，記名御史，日本神戶朝鮮仁川領事。廷試時，讀卷大臣進呈十卷，老人居首選；以對策主張立憲，忤慈禧后旨，抑置三甲一名，遂失大魁，聞者惜之。亂中族兄南鐵先生曾於冷攤得其殿試卷，予嘗見之。　　清季沈北山太史劾三凶（剛毅，榮祿，李蓮英，，直聲　天下，其　稿實老人所代擬　其事予另爲文記之　　　丁丑之亂，老人避地至桂林，中途折一足，至上海，與沈佩畦師共居，足不下樓者數年。晚境彌劣，獨子早逝，僅有一女，適邵，外孫延慶，是時遂依女以活；更　刧餘書畫以資衣食。所著續　海花化說部，初由人介紹發表於北平中和月刋，略得稿酬，繼由某書局刊爲單行本，則分文未得。聞銷路至不惡，老人之女亦不欲追究其事，但幸其父之著述得流傳不朽也。老人尙譯有元秘史，曾發表於國學論衡；復有文稿筆記等、悉藏廷　家。　　予前年在蘇州存古　購得老人手校山谷全集，研朱精勘，點畫不遺，楊无恙丈　夢苕師各爲作一跋，稱昔年更見老人手批成唯識論韓昌黎王臨川梅宛陵諸集；亂中散失，亦不知流轉何所。老人之詩，人知其崇法玉溪，其實用力於山谷甚深；山谷荊公同出玉谿，老人固得其秘奧矣。　　　今春予詣老人舊居英園，自經兵　，荒蕪滿日，不勝今昔之感。老人曾有園居詩曰：「坐臥荒園二十春，白松蒼石絕織塵；老天聊盡維持力，留待他年愛護人。」老人深於內典，固知萬法皆空，緣盡則滅。然頭白門生到此，不無悽戀之感也。小雨點  施濟美　　好人是寂寞的，壞人是孤獨的，不好也不壞的人是痛苦的。　　你撒下了鳳仙的種子，花社　怎能開出牡丹呢？　　假使在空中建　美麗璀璨的仙宮，還不如在泥工地上堆一個小丘。　　一面太淸楚的鏡子，也許你因爲照見了自已的雀斑和酒刺而覺得討厭，但是它忠實的提醒了你——讓你有自知之明。　　麻雀的翅膀硬了，尙要脫離牠的老窠，人能够一輩子株守家園嗎？　　你不要慨喚人們將你遺忘了，也許是你拋撤了人家呢？　　　光滑如鏡的地面上，悠揚的音樂聲裏，華爾滋開始了，你也許要抱怨脚上的一雙布鞋不能翩翩起舞吧？　　但是，在崎嶇的山道中，你的布鞋有用了，華美的高跟鞋被來在一旁。二十世紀的恥辱  理初　　雖然二十世紀是自由平等的世紀，但種族歧視的問題仍存在於今日的美國。　　在美國的南部，黑白界限非常嚴。黑人不能進白人的學校；坐火軍有黑人的一專車」；戲院，敎堂　其他的公共塲所黑白均有各別的入口和座位，然人錯走了白人的入口固是「罪有應得一，而白人錯走了黑人的入口也是「有千禁例」。不久以前華萊士的競選帮手參議員泰勒因在伯明漢一個黑人的集會中堅持要由黑人的入口處進入，被治安當局控以擾亂公共秩序罪，結果法院判處罰金五十元，拘役一百入十天，但坸役部份緩刑。　　更苦的是黑人在白人區域置產也橫受干涉。聖魯易城有一個叫雪萊的黑人營造家在白人區買了所房子，剛搬入就遭四週「白鄰」　告　轉涉訟的結果，雪萊雖停得保全他的財產，但已費盡氣力。可見在白人不成問題的事—例如置產—在黑人却成了「大問題」。　　黑人是省可厭呢？白人老說他們愚笨，不潔，和道德低落。不潔和道德低落即使是事實，但可能是由於經濟和社會的因素所造成；愚笨却不見得。近年來黑人在文學·音樂·工程等方面的成就、證明了他們並非愚笨。紐約有一　天才學校，所收錄的都是智力很高的天才兒童，而內中也有黑人。　　這種種　的成見無疑地是文明進步的障碍。可是展望未來，尙未見有何改善的希望。最近南菲大選國民黨的馬蘭博士獲勝，他所標　的政策之一即是更澈底地推行白人和有色人極　隔離。這是一個時代的述流，也是「文明人」的恥　。　　北美合衆國之黃金世界，有其天然之價越　賦，有其人工之歷史的努力，彼土资源特富，工業科學莫非世界第一位，故擁有全球金率百分之九十而强，其一切享用之臺華，誠莫之爲而爲之，非可勉強效　，且西方寓言小說，已有諷刺拜金之故事，略言一人終日營營於黃金，居處器　，莫非黃金，馴至五官四肢，亦變爲黃金，遂爲不能言不能動之廢人。是固困於物質者之濯項醍醐，况乎中國積貧積弱，大難之餘，徒見鄰邦之富，亦歩亦趨，未免幼稚已甚。聞滬上拍賣奸道財產內　石金珠不可數計，可見目迷心醉，只知多鑫益善，並如何享用，如何支配，亦不自知，正如「拾金」一劇之化子及貪歡報劇中之張旺，手執大元賣，罔知所揹，直是暴發戶之十足形容！肯舊官僚如盛宣懷之輩，何嘗不惟利是圖，發財無數，然用於自享，用於慈善，用於敎育文化，用於貢獻太后，皆井井有條，所謂「花過見過」。此事亦有「在行一「老趕一之分，新舊闊人之別在　。寒山寺新碑之始末  鄭逸梅　　畫家吳湖帆病　，聞已出院，一昨力往訪之，壁間張有寒山寺新碑拓本，高秀蒼雄，墨色又湛然似小兒目睛，對之自有思逸神飛之樂。詢之湖帆，始知是碑最近立於吳中中寒山寺，爲黃懷覺刻，湖帆即托懷覺舶運至寺，碑旣立，寺中住　致　湖帆，以申謝忱。碑爲滄州張繼書，錄唐人月落鳥啼霜滿天詩一絕，以行書出之，具見工力，且附識云，。（予夙慕寒山寺勝蹟，頻年往來吳鬥，迄未一遊，湖帆先生以予名與唐代題楓橋夜泊詩者相同，囑書此詩鐫石，惟丁名實取恒久之義，非妄襲詩人也。」下有湖帆之跋云：「予以張　泉先生與唐張繼同，乃請　伯欣先生轉求書楓橋夜泊詩，不意書成，翌日溥公即作古人，遂成絕筆，是亦前生文綠也。爰付刻石，樹寒寺山中，留此佳話，並將濮君兩刻於下，眞　贈史館保存云。」　函云：「湖帆先生左右，申江　敎。諸承款接、別後俗元，兼以　件尙未報命，致　　候，歎仄無旣。　橋夜泊詩，屢事敦促，因張溥老近日勞瘁過甚，致　至前三日始行書就，越一夕即作古人矣。此紙實其絕筆，史館同人欲予保留。繼又因　　對於此紙，自　勝　，自應將眞蹟寄呈，惟懇尊處於上石之後，仍將原紙寄還史館，仲其保存，作爲紀念品，幸賜俯允，感戴不盡矣。天寒手凍，草草不恭，敬頌台綏，並候　福。弟　一乘拜啓。」蓋湖帆與張　不相識，去冬，劉禺生自京赴粵，道出滬壖，居　蘭若中，盤桓若干日，湖帆訪談，頗以寒山寺俞曲園所書楓橋詩碑被日人螢去爲憾，擬請禺生轉懇溥老一書，時濮伯欣適在座，禺生謂伯欣佐溥老治史，何必舍近就遠，此可托伯欣爲之。旣而溥老以狹心症逝世，湖帆以詩碑未就，大爲悼惘，不意越日郵吏持國史館一巨函至，發之，溥老親書也。而刻舶運之懷覺，謂寒山寺之曲園碑尙存在，被日人發去云云，爲當時之謠傳。又明文衡山所書之碑雖已毀斷，今猶留四五字，與溥老之碑，鼎足而三。予已十年不返吳門，他日得暇，當一往　認瞻賞也。（編者按：張溥老書楓橋詩事，施肿　先生曾有紀載，刊去冬自由談·而讀者來函爭欲一睹溥老絕筆者頗不乏人，今承鄭先生詳記始末，復假拓本付刋，當可饜讀者諸君之望矣。）初试庖廚  允　　有一個新婚的美國女人，站在一家肉店的門前，看着陳列在櫥窗內各種肉類發呆。店中夥計就趨前招呼她道：「小姐，您要買些甚麼？　　她羞澀的問題：「你們可有些什麼肉，即使燒得不對，吃起來也依舊很可口的嗎？」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Minister of Finance Plans to Open New Tax Sources to Balance Revenue and Expenditure in the Second Half of the Year, Considering a One-Time Property Tax <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] The new Minister of Finance, Wang Yunwu, has already begun calculating and planning the national revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of this year. After Wang's arrival at the ministry, he separately spoke with the heads of various responsible units to study the possible amount of revenue for the second half of the year and planned to open up new tax sources. Wang instructed the heads of responsible units, especially the heads of tax authorities, to first conduct detailed research and planning. A meeting will be convened in the coming days specifically to discuss how to balance revenue and expenditure in the second half of the year. According to rough estimates from relevant sources, the budget for various tax revenues in the first half of the year is over 30 trillion yuan, but the commodity tax revenue may reach 50 trillion yuan. The income from the disposal of enemy and puppet materials is approximately 20 trillion yuan. However, after offsetting revenue and expenditure in the first half of the year, there is still a 50% shortfall. The total national revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of the year is projected to reach 200 trillion yuan in tax revenue. However, based on estimates of the inflation rate in the first half of this year, total expenditure in the second half of the year may reach × hundred trillion. The gap between revenue and expenditure is still significant. In addition to planning to open up new tax sources, Wang also plans to use the following methods to increase national income: (1) Sale of state-owned enterprises; (2) Disposal of enemy and puppet materials; (3) Disposal of Japanese reparations materials; (4) US aid. The aim is to gradually bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance. According to Wang's calculations and planning over the past few days, there will still be a considerable gap after offsetting revenue and expenditure. In recent days, he has been considering various ways to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] In order to plan for increased national income and save the current economic crisis, Wang Yunwu is currently considering a one-time property tax, so that those with money can use their excessive profits to compensate for the national financial crisis. Wang is determined to implement a one-time property tax, believing it to be the only way to open up new tax sources. However, he believes that the implementation technology is very difficult and requires detailed study. Wang met with a tax official on the 5th and discussed this matter.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] In order to balance the budget and review the foreign exchange of government agencies, the new Executive Yuan decided to establish a Budget Review Committee. Its organizational regulations have been passed by the first temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan and listed as one of the various special committees within the Yuan. Originally, the budget and foreign exchange cases were handled by the Accounting Department of the Executive Yuan. Now, because the new Executive Yuan does not have an Accounting Department, the foreign exchange part is also handled by the Budget Review Committee. The committee has six tasks: (1) Matters concerning the coordination of the administrative guidelines of various agencies with the budget; (2) Matters concerning the review of the revenue and expenditure budgets of various agencies and the review of the general budget; (3) Matters concerning the settlement and purchase of foreign exchange within the budget; (4) Matters concerning the review of foreign exchange outside the budget; (5) Matters concerning the review of the mobilization of the first and second reserve funds and overall subject matters; (6) Other matters related to the budget and foreign exchange. The committee has one chairman, who is stipulated to be concurrently held by Gu Mengyu, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. The members are Xu Kan, the Comptroller-General; Wang Yunwu, the Minister of Finance; Yu Hongjun, the Governor of the Central Bank; Lei Zhen, Dong Guang, Yang Yongjun, Zheng Zhenwen, and Li Weiguo, the Secretary-General. It is stipulated that the committee will meet twice a week, once to review the budget and once to review foreign exchange. In the future, all budget and foreign exchange cases submitted to the Yuan Council for discussion will first be submitted to the committee for review.</p>

<p>Opinions of the Acting President of Yenching University</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 5th Dispatch] Lu Zhiwei, the acting president of Yenching University, said: Ambassador Stuart's statement is mainly directed at the semi-official opposition to the United States supporting Japan, and the relationship with intellectuals or students is likely to be less. Lu believes that the US support for Japan is a matter of degree, and it has not yet reached the point of restoring aggressive forces. However, if the US plan to defend against the Soviet Union in East Asia fails, then supporting Japan to defend against the Soviet Union is inevitable. However, the United States is very clear about Chamberlain's deception by Hitler, so it will not repeat the same mistake. Today, the important thing is to stand on our own feet. Isn't everyone bullying China now?</p>

<p>Escaping from the Bandit's Den, A Letter of Blood and Tears, Communist Bandits Brutally Massacre the People, Reaching the Most Severe Stage [Times News Agency, Nanjing] Our agency recently received a letter of blood and tears from Mr. Sun, a 62-year-old. In the letter, he poured out the suffering he endured in the bandit area. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a refugee who recently escaped from the communist bandit den in Feixian County. I am a family member of a soldier in the War of Resistance. I am 62 years old. My son, Sun Peiyuan, and my second son, Sun Fuyuan, both graduated from the Central Military Academy and joined the army to fight against the Japanese for eight years. My second son served in the expeditionary force in Burma. After the victory, they both sent letters home. At that time, my eldest son was a lieutenant colonel in the Chongqing Military Officers' Corps, and my second son was a major staff officer in the 9th Brigade of the 9th Division. Later, as the communist banditry in our county intensified, news was cut off. Because I am a family member of a soldier in the War of Resistance, I was even more resented by the communist bandits. They insisted on giving me the title of "stubborn" and maliciously sending me the Kuomintang emblem. They made me wear a grass rope and parade through the streets, wearing a paper hat, gathering crowds to mock me, beating gongs and drums, like a monkey in a show, beating, spitting, scolding, like scolding cattle and horses, using thousands of methods to insult me in every possible way. As for houses and fields, they were divided and distributed after struggle sessions. Food, clothing, and household items were looted by instigating mobs. Movement was restricted, and neighbors were not allowed to interact. Speech was punished, and no relatives dared to inquire. Even the slightest carelessness or violation would result in heavy beatings or even death.</p>
<p>I was living in a deep abyss, truly suffering the pain of wanting to live but being unable to, wanting to die but being unable to. Recently, the Mao bandits have intensified their cruelty, and the massacres have reached the most severe stage, extensively implementing the "Three Cleans" and "Three Checks." The "Three Cleans" are: Clean Background, Clean Class, Clean Bloodline. The "Three Checks" are: Check Ideology, Check Tendency, Check Work. All those who were classified as landlords, regardless of gender, were killed. Intellectuals, regardless of age, were not spared! The bandits' intention is to exterminate mankind to satisfy their desire for massacre. Recently, during the pilot implementation period, news of those being investigated and brutally killed is heard every day. Although I have suffered countless struggles and insults, I was still unable to escape. Last December, I was dragged by bandits to a public square. A crowd of bandits gathered, and with a shout, they began punching, kicking, and beating me with sticks. In an instant, I lost consciousness and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I was already in the bandit's prison, awaiting death. As for the bandits' methods of killing – there is the "Viewing Platform," the "Single-Log Bridge," the "Toad Jumping Pit," the "Monkey Climbing Pole," all kinds of cruel punishments, too many to count. Anyone with a little humanity would be terrified upon hearing them! In the bandit's prison, I could only wait for my neck to be stretched out and die, as there was no hope of survival. I thought to myself that when the bandits held a public trial, I would not know what kind of cruel punishment I would suffer before dying. Fortunately, the National Army went to suppress the bandits, and the bandits fled in panic. I seized the opportunity to escape to Gaojia Village in Sishui County. My family of six also fled with the army. After nine deaths and one life, we were fortunate to see the light of day again. However, with seven old and weak people, we are adrift in a foreign land, without clothes or food, suffering from hunger and cold. Having just escaped the tiger's mouth, we are now facing the difficulties of hunger and cold. Therefore, I poured out the suffering I endured in the bandit area in this blood-soaked letter, so that young people will know the communist bandits' inhumanity and not be seduced by their sweet words. I also hope that my two sons will see this letter and find a way to help us so that we will not starve to death. If there are any kind gentlemen, or my son's former commanders, or friendly colleagues or classmates who know their recent whereabouts, please give us a message. The sincerity of our gratitude cannot be expressed in words. With best wishes for your well-being. The 62-year-old Sun Baojun wrote in tears</p>
<p>New Shandong Style: Everything for the People, Wang Yaowu Elaborates on Specific Content [Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] Chairman Wang Yaowu held a simple dinner with one dish and one soup for reporters from this newspaper on the evening of the 4th, after returning from Nanjing. During the dinner, he elaborated on the reasons for his request to resign, his feelings upon returning, the specific content of the new style movement he is promoting, and future measures concerning the military and political situation in Shandong.</p>
<p>He first told reporters that he originally made the biggest determination to resign due to various reasons. My own plan was to suggest to the central government that after I resign from my current concurrent positions, I hope to be able to select three reorganized divisions and have the central government assign two more reorganized divisions to form a mobile corps dedicated to fighting the main force of the communist bandits. Wherever He Hu (a commander) reports an emergency, they will be reinforced there, becoming a stabilizing force. I am absolutely willing to endure hardship to serve the leader and the country. The highest authorities expressed approval in principle for this suggestion, but the focus of the problem was that there were no suitable successors. Therefore, after my firm resignation was not accepted, I had no choice but to come back and jump into the "Mao pit" (a Shandong dialect term meaning "not pretty"). Since my resignation was not approved, the central government has agreed to strengthen the military strength of Shandong and supplement Shandong's forces.</p>
<p>I have many feelings after returning, but the most important of these is first, change, but it must change in a good direction in order to survive; second, research, researching how to change in a good direction; third, quick action, after the goal of change is determined, we should carry out the task with a spirit of quick action; fourth, self-reliance.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang then elaborated on the new style movement he is promoting after his return. He analyzed the overall goal of loving the people and being close to the soldiers in great detail. For the former, we must achieve (1) taking the people as the foundation of the country, everything is for the people, and military, government, and educational personnel are serving the people; (2) overthrowing all corrupt and evil ideas, traditional bad habits of exploiting the people, preying on the people, and sacrificing the people, and immediately mobilizing for the benefit of the people; (3) officials who neglect the interests of the people and hinder the lives and livelihoods of the masses should be given absolute power to be sanctioned; (4) our officials should supervise each other, learn from each other, and encourage each other. For the latter, we must achieve (1) the widespread accumulation of bad habits among commanding officers, such as the disparity in life between officers and soldiers and the lack of demonstration, leading to poor discipline and demoralization; (2) commanding officers should treat soldiers like parents treat their children, with love, protection, and the natural and obligatory duty to care for them; otherwise, they are not standard commanding officers and should be abandoned by the masses; (3) the specific items of being close to the soldiers include living frugally, sharing weal and woe, cutting down on extravagant expenses, enriching nutrition, encouraging the excellent, and sanctioning the dregs. Among the methods of implementing the new style, he especially emphasized integrity and resolutely decided to crack down on corrupt local bullies, hoping for the support of the media. Regarding land reform, it was decided that "three-one rent payment and land grant to soldiers" will be achieved this year.</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Wang answered reporters' questions. The Shandong Provincial Government will undergo a partial reorganization in the short term, and there is absolutely no problem with the security of Jinan. In fact, I have completed all preparations. Not to mention three or five communist bandit columns coming to attack, even ten columns can be handled with ease. Regarding the entire suppression of the rebellion, due to the change in the National Army's strategy, we will adopt mobile warfare as much as possible in the future. In addition, a large number of new troops will be trained and completed in the short term, so the entire situation should be completely changed soon.</p>
<p>Director of Civil Affairs Liu Xiang Firmly Resigns, Personnel Decisions Will Be Partially Adjusted, Director of Civil Affairs Liu Xiang Firmly Resigns, Peng Guodong Internally Appointed as Successor [Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] The personnel of the Shandong Provincial Government will be partially adjusted. According to sources, Director of Civil Affairs Liu Xiang is determined to resign due to the arduous situation in Shandong and his weak health. Peng Guodong, former director of the Southwestern Shandong Administrative Office and now a member of the Provincial Council, has been internally appointed as his successor.</p>

<p>Failure to Obtain Soviet Cooperation in Currency Reform, West Germany Will Implement It Alone, Allied Control Council in Berlin May Reopen [Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Reliable sources indicate that the Soviet Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Sokolovsky, convened his main financial and political advisors at his Berlin headquarters on Monday. German political figures close to the Soviet military government believe that this meeting will determine the Soviet Union's attitude towards the currency reform that West Germany will implement this month. It is expected that the Soviet authorities will make one last preparation to reopen the Four-Power talks to discuss the currency reform of the entire Germany. Political figures pointed out that the German-language Berlin Night Express, registered with the Soviets, recently published an editorial calling on the French Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Koenig, to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council before June 15th. It is rumored that June 15th is the deadline for the implementation of currency reform in West Germany. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union itself is unwilling to take the initiative to reopen the Allied Control Council meeting, but if it is convened by another power, the Soviet Union would be happy to participate. French officials here also expressed their belief that the Allied Control Council is expected to be convened on June 10th, which would be the first meeting of the Allied Control Council since Sokolovsky withdrew from the Allied Control Council on March 20th. People from all parties in Germany are also eagerly hoping that the Allied Control Council can reopen its meeting, believing that this is the last chance to avoid East and West Germany from implementing currency reform separately, so as to prevent Germany from falling into a confirmed split state.</p>
<p>According to a very reliable report from the Soviet-occupied zone, Soviet-led groups and authorities there have begun to adopt a policy of easing and ingratiating themselves with the Germans. Since June 1st, police checks on passengers on highways and railways have been greatly relaxed. Free German labor movement personnel controlled by the Communist Party have gone to various parts of the zone to visit church people, volunteering to cooperate with the church in the planned social reform program. Another group, the Farmers' Association, also suddenly reduced its political propaganda and devoted itself to rural revitalization programs. It is generally believed that the purpose of the Soviet Union's policy is to win people's hearts and unite as many Germans as possible to form a national front in preparation for announcing the establishment of East Germany to counter the West Germany that the Western Allies will establish.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Diplomatic officials said that the Western countries intend to immediately reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to establish a sound and unified currency system in the entire Germany for domestic and international trade. The details have not yet been revealed. The chances of success of this action can be seen in the fact that the Soviet Union and the Western countries have strongly argued for the need for a unified currency system. The United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have established a new agreement on this matter. The Soviet Union recently condemned the Western powers, especially the United States, for undermining the Four-Power Berlin talks on German financial reorganization. The United States and Britain have denied these accusations. In recent weeks, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Military Governor of Germany Clay have expressed their hope to promote a national new currency. If the Soviet Union opposes this request or wants to shelve it indefinitely, it is said that the Western countries will proceed with the currency reform plan for West Germany alone.</p>
<p>Vandenberg Will Make Every Effort to Restore Original Foreign Aid Amount, Preparing to Attend Senate Appropriations Committee to State Opinions [Reuters, Washington, 5th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today, requesting permission to attend and testify, presenting his opposition to the reduction of foreign aid expenses. Vandenberg's move shows that he will personally lead the Senate's efforts to restore foreign aid expenses after they were reduced by the House of Representatives. Vandenberg's friends revealed that the foreign aid bill was passed by Congress, largely due to Vandenberg's efforts. Now that he has heard that the House of Representatives has passed a reduced appropriation案, it is like a major blow to him, so Vandenberg is doing his best to restore the original amount.</p>
<p>According to State Department officials, the reduction in the Marshall Plan's expenses was affected by the recent Soviet peace offensive. The Soviet Union's peace offensive has eased the international tensions of recent months, so the House Appropriations Committee believes that it is not necessary to allocate such a huge amount of money to aid other countries. Therefore, State Department officials have been lobbying in the congressional lounge for the past 36 hours to correct the over-reliance on the Soviet peace offensive and the resulting situation. It is generally believed that some of the expenses reduced by the House of Representatives have no hope of being restored to their original state. Even if the Senate resolves to maintain the original amount, the final result can only be a compromise between the amounts approved by the House and the Senate. The consequences of the reduction in foreign aid are not limited to one aspect. The most important one is the impact on the United States' foreign policy based on the Marshall Plan. Marshall has already stated that after the reduction, the reconstruction plan will only become a relief plan. Many members of Congress seen in the Capitol area are serious, showing their importance to the reduction of foreign aid. Since the Republican National Convention will be held in Philadelphia on June 21st to elect presidential candidates, the congressional session is very rushed. If the situation falls into a serious state, Truman, who has already set off on a national campaign tour, may rush back to Congress to issue a warning himself.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade Agreement Act, Term Should Be Extended, Marshall's Advisor Expresses Opinion [Marshall's Advisor Expresses Opinion] [Reuters, Washington, 7th] Former Deputy Secretary of State Clayton, Special Economic Advisor to Secretary of State Marshall, testified before the Senate Finance Committee, solemnly warning against accepting certain restrictions added to the Foreign Trade Agreement Act that has already been passed by the House of Representatives. He pointed out that these restrictions would kill the reciprocal trade plan created by former Secretary of State Hull. Clayton earnestly urged the Senate Finance Committee to overturn the House's resolutions that have been passed to limit the extension of the bill to a maximum of one year, and to limit the president's power to negotiate tariff reduction agreements with other countries. He requested that the government's requested three-year extension be maintained. He pointed out that among the sixteen countries that have accepted Marshall Aid, Austria, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Denmark, and Ireland have not yet signed reciprocal trade agreements with the United States. If the extension is only for one year, it will not be possible to conclude them one by one.</p>
<p>Vietnam Provisional Government Joins French Federation, Ho Chi Minh Denounces It as Puppet Government [United Press, Hanoi, 5th] The French-sponsored Vietnam Provisional Central Government was announced on Saturday near Haiphong on a French warship. French High Commissioner Bollaert, Annam Sun King Bao Dai, and Provisional Government Prime Minister Nguyen Van Xuan signed a treaty recognizing its accession to the French Federation. Bao Dai read out the proclamation of the establishment of the Provisional Government. His yellow embroidered red dragon imperial flag flew alongside the French tricolor flag and the new national flag of the Provisional Government (yellow with red stripes). Bao Dai's own status is still unclear. Although referred to as His Majesty, he is not included in the new government. The Vietnamese government led by Ho Chi Minh calls this new regime a puppet government.</p>
<p>New Government List [Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] The Vietnam Provisional Central Government has been formed and sworn in at the Li Li Hall at 5 PM this afternoon. The list of the new government is as follows: Chairman and Minister of National Defense Nguyen Van Xuan, Vice Chairman, Governor of Cochinchina Tran Van Khac, Governor of Tonkin Nghiem Xuan Thien, Governor of Annam Phan Nguyen Giao, Minister of Propaganda Phan Huy Dan, Minister of Finance Nguyen Trung Vinh, Minister of Public Health Dang Huu Tri, Minister of Youth and Sports Nguyen Khoa Toan, Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports Yen Xuan Trach, Minister of Interior Nguyen Khac Tri, Deputy Minister of National Defense Tran Quang Vinh, Minister of Justice Nguyen Khac Ve, Minister of Agriculture Tran Thien Hong, Minister of Public Works Nguyen Van Tu, Chief Secretary Dinh Xuan Quang.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Restore Old System of Tong Organizations, Our Government Protests to France, Declares All Consequences Should Be Borne by France [Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] The French Commissioner for Tonkin, Dicaux, officially announced this afternoon that the system of Overseas Chinese Tong Offices will be restored from today onwards, and has also announced the list of persons in charge of Overseas Chinese Tong Offices in various places. This move is similar in nature to the dissolution of various Chinese General Associations in the Saigon-Cholon area by the French authorities in Cochinchina, and the accusation of the responsible persons of various Chinese General Associations of the crime of organizing illegal groups. The question of the organizational method of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam is one of the Sino-French diplomatic cases, which is still under negotiation. Before the result of the negotiation was reached, the French side took unilateral action, apparently trying to create a fait accompli and restore the old system before the war. Our government, considering that the French side disregarded its repeated promises and took unilateral action, submitted a written protest today, and declared that all consequences should be borne by the French side.</p>
<p>British Commissioner for Southeast Asia Says He Will Prevent Communist Activities [United Press, Singapore, 6th] British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald said in a broadcast tonight that there is an indication that international communist leaders have decided to launch a political offensive in Asia after being frustrated in Europe. Communist agitators are desperately trying to implement the rule of the sword in the plantations, mines, and factories of the Malayan region. Such movements must be suppressed. Labor unrest occurred in Malayan rubber plantations, factories and tin mines last month.</p>
<p>Fourth Anniversary of the Normandy Landing, Britain and France Hold Grand Commemorations, Encouraging Each Other to Continue to Maintain Unity [Reuters, Paris, 6th] Today, with international tensions unabated, the French people commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Normandy landings, a turning point in World War II, with particular emotion. French President Auriol and British and American ambassadors went to the Normandy coast to pay tribute, laying wreaths at the tombs of British, American, and Canadian soldiers. The President also went to the city of Caen in northern France, which was the site of the heaviest sacrifices in the landing battle by British and Canadian troops. A special memorial mass was held at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris was filled with wreaths to commemorate this earth-shattering battle four years ago.</p>
<p>Truman Arrives in Omaha, Speaks on Importance of Agriculture [United Press, Nebraska, Omaha, 5th] President Truman, touring the western states, spoke in this agricultural area today, advocating support for agriculture and ensuring the future welfare of rural America, roughly the same as the bill he presented to Congress on May 14th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Omaha, 5th] President Truman, speaking at the 35th Division reunion today, said that the United States is determined to do its best to make the United Nations succeed. He said that after World War II, the United States embarked on a new path, without repeating the mistakes of the aftermath of World War I, when shortsighted people in the Senate prevented us from joining the League of Nations, and the United States suffered from it. Therefore, we should be vigilant now and not let the tragedy after World War I repeat itself.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Omaha, Nebraska, 5th] Truman, after arriving in this traditionally isolationist Midwest, his "non-political" transcontinental journey has turned into a very solemn political activity. He himself is more confident that he can be re-elected in the November election. Every time he goes to one of these five states, he asks the people to help him be re-elected. Truman's trip has been warmly welcomed, and the work of directly promoting himself to the Americans seems to be successful. Judging from the response received in the initial stages of his trip, his prestige has obviously increased, but it remains to be seen what kind of achievements he can achieve.</p>
<p>Maintaining Intermediate Forces, French Premier Decides to Continue in Office [Central News Agency, Paris, 5th, Associated Press] It is reported that French Prime Minister Schuman has decided to maintain his "Third Force" government at all costs, at least until October of this year, to avoid a conflict between the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Today is the fourth anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, and churches throughout Britain held religious ceremonies to commemorate the brave warriors who sacrificed themselves four years ago. The memorial to the 255,000 Allied soldiers who died in the battle, built at the Portsmouth naval base, was also commemorated today by the British Empire Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Eliminating Selfishness, Seeking International Understanding, Auriol Calls on the Powers [Reuters, Paris, 6th] French President Auriol gave a speech at the Anbeson fortress in Normandy yesterday, calling on the victorious Allied nations of World War II to maintain unity and fulfill their national missions. After mentioning the great achievements of the Allied forces and the French resistance fighters, Auriol said, "We must restore the principles of the Allied nations unanimously held during the five years of resistance, and the principles of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter. These principles require all countries to fulfill their missions and are the best guarantee against suspicion, fear, and shrinking back. We know that the responsibility for the current situation lies in the selfish psychology of the countries, which has misunderstood the revolution of the modern world and the distinction between its individual interests and true independence. For this reason, France is prepared to limit part of its sovereignty on the basis of reciprocity to ensure international security, such as the establishment of an international security force and international control of weapons produced in factories and laboratories. We believe that if we can recognize the axioms of the Internet order and the needs of prosperity, and have the will to succeed, any disputes of the past can be easily resolved. France is concerned about its own obligations for the safety of all countries in the world. France has the right to obtain its legitimate compensation, and has the right to declare the danger of any international policy that does not show its warnings and experiences. France is most sensitive to these international policies. France has the right to demand that the enemy of yesterday not become the enemy of the victorious country, and has the right to demand that the victorious countries agree and fulfill their obligations to each other.</p>
<p>Arab-Israeli Stalemate, Bernadotte Has Not Met with Arab-Israeli Leaders, Israeli Side Unwilling to Concede on Immigration Issue [Reuters, London, 6th] United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte left Rhodes this morning for Haifa to meet again with Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok. After the meeting between Bernadotte and Shertok, he will fly to Amman, the capital of Jordan, to meet with Arab League leaders, and then fly back to Cairo to study the results of today's negotiations and decide on the final course of action.</p>
<p>At the same time, British Commander-in-Chief of Palestine General Macmillan also left Haifa today for the Suez Canal area to meet with senior British officials. It is expected that the meeting will decide on the plan for the implementation of the ceasefire and make recommendations to Bernadotte. In the military aspect, the war continues on all fronts, but the positions of both sides have not changed significantly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte met with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi for 90 minutes in Cairo on the 5th to seek a ceasefire formula acceptable to both Jews and Arabs. In addition, Bernadotte also met with United Nations Commissioner for Jerusalem Evans and Peng Qu of the United Nations Palestine Committee Secretariat. Bernadotte seemed very optimistic when he arrived in Beirut, saying that both the Jewish and Arab sides were hoping to accept his ceasefire terms. It is understood that the current stumbling block is still the immigration issue. The Security Council has entrusted Bernadotte with full power to decide on this matter. The Arab side insisted that immigration to Palestine must be stopped first before it would accept the ceasefire plan, while the Jewish side disagreed. The Security Council originally scheduled a meeting yesterday to discuss whether Jewish men of military age should be allowed to enter Palestine during the ceasefire period, but it was suddenly canceled and Bernadotte was authorized to decide. If Bernadotte can reconcile the opinions of the Jews and Arabs on the immigration issue without the Security Council continuing the debate, then Bernadotte can be regarded as a suitable candidate to complete the final solution to Palestine.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 5th] An Israeli spokesman said on the 5th that unless the Arabs make concessions on the immigration dispute that is delaying the start of the truce, the chances of a Palestinian truce will suffer a "serious blow." He firmly adhered to the provision of the United Nations Security Council ceasefire plan, which specifically stipulates that men of military age may immigrate to Palestine during the ceasefire period, as long as they are not trained or mobilized. Currently, the Jewish side seems to have no hope of accepting a compromise on this point, and may only agree to immigrate men of military age at a slower pace.</p>
<p>Work of the Small Assembly Emphasizes Mediation of Disputes, Progress Has Been Made in Promoting International Cooperation [Central News Agency, Lake Success, 6th] US representative to the United Nations Small Assembly Jessup said today that the Small Assembly has made practical progress in the work of promoting the general principles of international cooperation and has improved the method of peaceful settlement of disputes. The 15-nation small group committee of the Small Assembly is currently studying how to implement the principles of international political cooperation stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Jessup made a statement on the work of the committee, especially mentioning the proposal jointly put forward by China and the United States. According to this proposal, a group of qualified people should be proposed, and member states or the United Nations should select some of them to participate in the investigation or reconciliation committee. Jessup also said that the Small Assembly is currently engaged in another work, which is to study how to peacefully resolve disputes through negotiation, mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, and legal solutions. The study of the above issues by the Small Assembly originated from the suggestion made by our representative Xu Shuxi in January of this year.</p>
<p>American People More Restless and Unstable in the Past Seven Years, Seventy Million People Move Frequently [United Press, New York, 5th] According to figures released by the US Bureau of Statistics, the American people have been more restless and unstable in the past seven years than at any time before. According to government statistics, 70 million people (almost half of the US population) moved to new homes from 1940 to 1947, of which 25 million moved from one country to another or from one state to another. Most of the movement was towards the west, with the western states increasing their population by 2 million people, and about 1.5 million people moving to the south. The main reason for the movement is employment opportunities. The average age of the people who move is 23 to 35 years old. Among young people aged 38 to 24, there are more women leaving home than men, and the educational level of those who move is higher than those who do not.</p>
<p>[France Press Agency, London, 6th] According to the London "People's Daily" today, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made a suggestion to the United States to divide the world into two spheres of influence. It is heard that the negotiations are currently being conducted by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the Soviet Union proposed to the United States to divide the world into two major spheres of influence, Negotiations are being conducted in Washington and Moscow [Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] The French Foreign Ministry today explained the recent signs of international politics as a compromise of East-West tensions. Among the various signs, two major facts are the most important: (1) The peaceful proposal of the Greek rebel leader; (2) The United States reduces its aid to Europe. It is believed here that the actions of the Greek rebels may have been instructed by the Kremlin. The United States' reduction of aid to the Marshall Plan seems to be a compromise action by Washington. In addition, the slight relaxation of East-West tensions can be proved by the following facts: (1) The Soviet Union abandoned part of Finland's reparations; (2) Neither Yugoslavia nor the Soviet Union denied the rumors of the dissolution of the International Intelligence Bureau.</p>
<p>Indonesian Membership Application Case, Asian Economic Committee Extends Discussion, Will Be Submitted Again Next Wednesday [United Press, Ootacamund, India, 5th] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East today extended the discussion of the Indonesian Republic's application for membership for the second time, and will submit it again next Wednesday. The Philippines proposed to postpone the discussion to the next meeting, which was passed with a vote of two to four after India proposed an amendment, which was seconded by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>General Commander Meng Presided over the Unveiling. During his speech, he earnestly called on all victorious Allied nations to continue to maintain unity. He said, "We have won the victory in the war. Will we lose the peace?" Recalling the course of the battle</p>

<p>Science, Radio Waves, and the Universe by Gang Ren</p>
<p>The progress of science has not only greatly changed human life but has also brought seemingly mysterious theories into practice, producing astonishing facts. Astronomy and physics are no exception. Conversely, much of our knowledge about the world, such as the atomic fission found in stars, being realized by humans on Earth, is the most obvious proof.</p>
<p>Therefore, people feel that it is worthwhile to spend human and material resources to explore the universe and reform old concepts. Tools and methods are, of course, the prerequisites for all research.</p>
<p>Since humans began thousands of years of cosmic exploration, they have relied on their naturally endowed eyes. This is clearly unreliable. Until Galileo introduced the telescope to us, it only moved the round celestial bodies, stars, and moons closer in a mirror. Observation was still with the naked eye, inevitably resulting in blurred and unrecognizable sensations.</p>
<p>It was not until the last century that scientists used spectroscopes to analyze the light emitted by celestial bodies into a spectrum. Although this spectrum provided them with much assistance, it was still insufficient for a thorough understanding of the composition of celestial bodies.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the astonishing progress in wireless battery research, wireless radio receivers have been expanded and applied to astronomy, serving as the latest tool among many less reliable instruments.</p>
<p>In 1929, American physicist U. J. Jansky heard a "hissing" noise from a shortwave radio receiver and proposed studying these sounds, which he believed came from other planets.</p>
<p>Many scientists continued to study this problem and reached the initial conclusion that the source of these sounds was the stars of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>At this time, Sir Edward Appleton and J. S. Hey in the United States also discovered that many powerful disturbances came from sunspots. Sunspots are the most powerful shortwave radio stations, with the equivalent of one million kilowatts of power.</p>
<p>At the recent British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, Sir Edward Appleton presented his 1946 report, pointing out the detailed relationship between the changes in sunspots and all radio waves on Earth.</p>
<p>Now, many scientists believe that the "cosmic static" discovered by Jansky may be coming from "star spots."</p>
<p>However, how to explain all these cosmic "static" sounds, our radio wave research is still an imperfect science, lacking experiments and records. But applying radio waves to cosmic research will undoubtedly allow people to understand more things.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that cosmic rays and cosmic "static" are not related, but a few scientists believe they come from the same source. Many Soviet and American scientists are actively studying this.</p>
<p>Obviously, our naked eyes can only see a very small part of the universe, and our eyeballs cannot analyze emitted light into a spectrum. Spectroscopes are used here to supplement this, allowing us to study the various substances contained in celestial bodies. Their eyeballs cannot accept cosmic "static" at all. However, with radio receivers, which convert electromagnetic energy into sounds that resonate in our eardrums and send them into our ears, humanity has tightened its grip on wisdom and tools.</p>
<p>Therefore, further research into the universe requires relying on these tools and methods. The United States and Britain are making great efforts in radio detection of the universe. Radar research and application are a beautiful interlude because they know that these disturbances to the quiet spectrum contain many truths that will not only serve as corroboration for existing theories but also generate new discoveries.</p>
<p>If metallurgists can find the most beautiful materials from the study of Earth's substances, bringing happiness to mankind, and a Russian scientist named Popov (Baport) before Marconi proposed "wireless communication," which is practically connected to people's information and emotions, why is literary cosmic research impossible?</p>
<p>Therefore, the harsh static first heard by Sir Jansky and the use of radio waves as a tool are not only extremely important in astronomy.</p>
<h3 id="e31">The Largest Telescope <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>by Li Zhonghuan</p>
<p>The world's largest astronomical telescope is a 200-inch reflector telescope installed on Mount Palomar in San Diego County, Southern California, USA. This 200-inch telescope can collect four times more starlight than the previous 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson and has more than twice the distance. It can see cosmic space beyond 100,000 light-years (approximately 5.865.696.000.000 miles). It is mounted on a base 137 feet in diameter and weighs 500 pounds. Engineers have tried their best to make it sophisticated and flexible, so a motor the size of a fist can make it turn freely.</p>
<p>As early as eighteen years ago, astronomer E. P. Hubble used a 100-inch telescope to measure gradually dimming nebulae and came to an unprecedented conclusion in the scientific community. He believed that the entire universe is expanding.</p>
<p>Astronomy has a speedometer to measure the movement of planets. Starlight is aligned with the telescope and then analyzed into a spectrum by a prism. When this spectrum is redder than normal, it indicates that the planet is farther away from Earth. This phenomenon is called "redshift." When Hubble discovered the phenomenon of redshift in light, the receding speed increased. His conclusion was: The receding speed of nebulae is proportional to their distance.</p>
<p>According to Hubble's discovery, nebulae beyond 250 million light-years are escaping at an astonishing speed of one-eighth faster than the speed of light. This theory aroused opposition from many scientists because Einstein's theory of relativity (the highest law of physics) states that nothing in the universe can move faster than the speed of light. The 100-inch telescope allowed Hubble to discover that the universe is expanding, but it also raised many unanswered questions. This requires a 200-inch telescope to solve.</p>
<p>In 1928, the Rockefeller Foundation agreed to manufacture this telescope for him, but no manufacturer could customize a 500-ton glass brick. In 1936, the glass brick for the lens was finally transported to the Palomar Optical Factory at the California Institute of Technology for polishing. Before it was completed, the Pacific War broke out. Hubble had to temporarily suspend his work to participate in wartime work.</p>
<p>After the war, he returned to the optical factory. Under his supervision, this extremely delicate polishing work proceeded step by step. This edge had to be parabolic. The accuracy had to reach one two-millionth of an inch. Visitors were not allowed to wear boots inside because a grain of sand could ruin months of polishing work. The mirror was finally completed in August 1946.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Uses of Television <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>by Qu Youding</p>
<p>Television (also known as wireless facsimile) is a major advancement in the electrical field in modern times. The benefits it provides to mankind are even greater than those of wireless radio. This method of transmitting distant object images was invented by the Englishman John L. Baird many years ago. Now, it is thriving and developing rapidly.</p>
<p>In addition to being used for family entertainment, television also has many normal and important uses, which are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Normally, divers can only dive to a depth of about two hundred feet, but with the use of television, our vision can be extended to a greater depth without any danger. This method involves placing a television display inside a thick metal-walled measuring cylinder, which is then lowered into the water from an observation ship and sunk to the depths of the ocean. The surveyors can then sit comfortably on the deck and complete their observation tasks in a few hours if they are skilled. For the television display, only a thicker cylinder wall is needed to resist the pressure at the bottom of the water. It does not need air supply, nor is it afraid of the near-zero temperature at a depth of six hundred feet. This underwater television can assist in marine rescue and underwater salvage operations and can indicate the appropriate location for drilling underwater oil wells. The depth to which it can sink is only related to the amount of pressure the cylinder wall can withstand.</p>
<p>The melting situation in glass furnaces and ore furnaces has always been unknown because their heat is too high. When measuring their high temperature, an optical pyrometer must be used to measure at a considerable distance. Observers must wear specially made black protective goggles, and only a moment is possible to observe. If you get too close, you will become blind and your skin will burn. However, if a television display is installed in the appropriate place inside the furnace, the melting situation can be reflected in the eyes of the factory's office engineers. The engineer can observe from start to finish, just like traveling inside the furnace. The radiant gold or glass inside the furnace provides sufficient light for the display. The display itself can be cooled with a special coolant liquid to prevent it from being destroyed by the fire. In the future, if it develops to a considerable extent, it may be possible to install television devices in all parts of the factory to facilitate centralized management and control, protect life safety, and promote the quality of production and increase output.</p>
<p>The continued development of television will completely change the education system. When necessary, the blackboard in the lecture hall will be changed to a television screen, especially in medical schools.</p>
<p>In terms of entertainment, it has gradually become widespread in the United States. The total number of television equipment across the country is often more than 100,000, and there are already enough relay broadcasting stations. However, its broadcast range currently only covers a circular area with a radius of 40 to 60 miles. A standard television broadcasting station usually has several hours of broadcasting time per day. The programs are mostly ball games on the sports field, wrestling, tickets, and theater scenes.</p>
<p>The above refers to black and white television. Recently, there has been an invention of full-color television. A year ago, the American Columbia Broadcasting Company made this claim, saying that using ultra-high-rate waves similar to radar waves can obtain brighter and clearer full-color television than black and white. Subsequent continued development will eventually succeed. This type of color transmission is entirely an electronic transmission, and the rotating parts in the equipment have been replaced by photocells and reflectors. There is a transmitting cathode ray tube at the transmitting end. The rays emitted by this tube pass through prisms and color coatings to the photocells and reflectors, and then emit a beam of light, which is divided into red, green, and blue color images and emitted. On the receiver side, there are three color separation mirrors, which simultaneously receive various color images and display them through the action of fluorescent and reflective screens.</p>
<p>The frequency of color television waves is higher than that required for black and white. Other parameters such as the emission rate, the number of prisms, and the picture repetition rate (30 times per second) are similar to those used previously. Therefore, only a frequency converter is needed to convert a black and white television receiver into a color one.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Summer Cooling Methods <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>by Liu Yi</p>
<p>Every summer, heat waves come, which greatly reduces our work efficiency. Although scientists have invented various cooling methods and equipment, such as electric fans and air conditioners, which are well known, these equipment are mostly limited to large restaurants, movie theaters, banks, large companies, and wealthy families. Most people are not blessed to enjoy them. In the hot summer, the scorching sun is fearful. Living in a small room is like being in a cage, which is indeed annoying.</p>
<p>Recently, the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois in the United States has established a residential cooling research laboratory, which is dedicated to researching how ordinary middle and lower-class people can cool their houses. The laboratory has special hot air pipe and air conditioning pipe equipment to test how to increase the temperature in winter and how to reduce the temperature in summer. The object of research is the ordinary houses where most people live. According to the experimental research, the effective and easy-to-implement method is to open the windows of the house as much as possible from 6 pm to 6 am the next day. Conversely, close the windows more during the day. In other words, it is advisable to let cold air flow in at night and retain it for daytime use. Open the doors and windows on the top floor at night. This forms a natural air circulation path, which can gradually flow the hot air in the lower floors of the room during the day to the outside. Close it again during the day to prevent the cold air in the room from flowing out. For those who want to be more comfortable, use curtains to cover the three sides of the doors and windows that are exposed to the sun. In this way, the intrusion of heat waves can be reduced. According to experimental results, the difference in coolness and heat between houses with curtains and without curtains can reach 20% to 30%, which means that the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors is 20% to 30%. This seems like a cliché and there is no great truth, but if you follow it, you will get the practical benefits of cooling. Moreover, this method is simple, easy to implement, and costs nothing.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Scientific News: Acid-Resistant Glass <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>by Liu Suisheng</p>
<p>Hydrofluoric acid can corrode glass, which is well known to those who study chemistry. Therefore, rubber bottles or wax bottles are usually used to store hydrofluoric acid. But today, hydrofluoric acid can be stored in glass bottles. Not only does it not change at the time, but even after three weeks, there is no sign of corrosion. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Hydrofluoric acid can chemically react with the main component of ordinary glass, sand, causing corrosion. The main component of the newly invented "anti-acid glass" is mostly phosphorus pentoxide.</p>
<p>This new type of glass was invented by the American Optical Company when studying the atomic bomb and handling another glass-corroding substance, uranium hexafluoride.</p>
<p>(Notes) (1) Hydrofluoric acid is made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to fluorite (calcium fluoride):</p>
<p>CaF2+H2SO4—CaSO4+H2F2 (Hydrofluoric Acid).</p>
<p>(2) The principle of hydrofluoric acid corroding ordinary glass:</p>
<p>3H2F2+Na2SiO3 (Glass)—2NaF+SiF4+3H2O.</p>
<p>Sodium fluoride, NaF, is soluble in water; silicon fluoride, SiF4, is a gas that escapes.</p>
<p>(3) Phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) can be produced by burning.</p>
<p>(4) Ordinary glass is made of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sand (SiO2).</p>
<h3 id="e35">Insect Growth Hormones <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>by Hao Tianhe</p>
<p>Although people have always been skeptical about the existence and function of hormones in insects, it has now been generally recognized by insect scientists such as Elggt Warth and Weed. A new science called Insect Endocrinology has also been established. Currently, most researchers focus on the following three aspects: (1) color hormones, (2) the function of base control hormones, and (3) growth hormones. This article only provides an overview of the third item.</p>
<p>In the late embryonic stage of insects, there is also a set of developmental procedures. Insects go through larvae and emerge as adults. This phenomenon is called metamorphosis. Some insects directly change from larvae to adults, and some insects must go through a pupal stage between larvae and adults. Although the metamorphosis of the former is gradual, the change in shape during the last molt is very different from the previous molts. The latter type of change is very significant at each stage. These two types of changes are consistent in physiology and steps, but they differ only in time and degree.</p>
<p>The growth hormones in insects can be divided into two types: (1) molting hormone; (2) metamorphic hormone.</p>
<p>(1) Molting hormone—Insect molting has a certain period, so the age is also mostly fixed. Due to the secretion of this hormone, the insect larvae can molt. For example, in the development period of some blood-sucking assassin bugs (scientific name Rho ntus), the first four instars take 12 to 15 days, while the last instar takes 28 days. If the head is cut off after it is full of food in the first few days of each instar, this can effectively prevent it from molting. Sometimes this headless assassin bug can live for more than a year. Hormone secretion has a certain time limit, called the critical period. The critical period for this blood-sucking assassin bug is 4 days after being full for the first four instars, and 7 days after being full for the last instar. If the head is cut off after the critical period, molting cannot be prevented because the hormone is transmitted in the insect's body through blood circulation. After the critical period, the hormone has been brought to the body (various parts). Try to connect two headless assassin bugs with a capillary tube at their necks, and then seal them with glue. In this way, an insect that has produced molting hormone can pour its hormone into the body of another insect that has not produced molting hormone through the blood. As a result, this insect can also molt. The properties and functions of the molting hormones produced in each instar are the same. Therefore, the blood of a fourth-instar larva can make a first-instar larva and a fifth-instar larva molt. It can even make a blood-sucking assassin bug that has molted once molt again. What is even stranger is that: molting hormone is not restricted by species. Insects with close blood relations can interact with each other. Therefore, a blood-sucking assassin bug can make another genus of assassin bug (Triatoma) molt. Even the bed bug (Cimex), which belongs to a different family, can make it molt. It is very clear that there is no species difference in molting hormone.</p>
<p>Another type of molting hormone is found in lepidopteran insects. The molting of some moths (scientific name Lymantria) from larvae to pupae depends on the action of this hormone. The critical period for this moth to produce this hormone is between 7 and 10 days of the last instar larva. During this period, if the last instar larva of this moth is cut with a knife or tied into two halves with thin silk, the front half will soon pupate, and the back half will not change even if it can live for a few weeks. If it is divided into two halves in the same way after 10 days, both the front and back halves can pupate soon. The critical period for silkworms (Bombyx mori) to pupate is before they stop eating. Similarly, people have used flies (Callipilora) for experiments. When this fly is about to pupate, tie the last instar larva into two sections with thin silk or hair. If it is within 12 hours, both the front and back sections can pupate. If it is before 12 hours, only the front half can pupate. Its critical period is 12 hours before pupation. To pupate the back half of this fly, you only need to inject the blood from the front half into the back half. The most interesting thing is that not only can injecting the blood of this fly into the body of its larvae cause the larvae to pupate early, but if the blood of wax moth (Galleria) larvae or pupae is drawn and injected into the larvae of this fly, it can also make the larvae pupate.</p>
<p>The secretions of these two molting hormones may come from the following four places: the first place to secrete hormones may be yellow cells. Between the epidermis and basement membrane of insects, there are some yellow, multi-lobed cells scattered. They were first discovered by Fabre, who named them yellow cells. In fact, they are colorless in the cortex of most insects. The growth of these cells varies with the type of insect. In some insects, such as in the larvae of one genus of insect (Thrixion), the yellow cells increase with age. The second instar is three times the size of the first instar, and the third instar is about twice the size of the second instar. In the larvae of other insects, such as silkworms, these cells increase periodically. Yellow cells can secrete molting hormone, which can be proved in silkworms. When silkworms molt each time, the cells in the skin are particularly enlarged and also show special activity. Conversely, if these cells do not change, the silkworms will not molt. The second possible place to secrete molting hormone is probably Verson's Gland. This gland also grows in the epidermal layer, under the old cornea, with thin tubes leading out to facilitate the excretion of secretions. The third place is the corpora allata. They are a pair of tiny white glands located between the small brain and mandibles of the larvae. Wigglesworth used the above-mentioned blood-sucking assassin bugs as research material and found that the cells of this gland are particularly enlarged during the critical period. The last possible place to secrete is the insect's brain. If the brain of the larva is cut off, it cannot pupate.</p>
<p>(2) Metamorphic hormone—Due to the existence of this hormone, it can prevent insect larvae or pupae from emerging into adults. This is the opposite of the function of the previously mentioned molting hormone. We inject the blood of fourth-instar larvae of blood-sucking assassin bugs into the bodies of last-instar larvae, which can prevent them from emerging. During the critical period of each instar larva, if their heads are cut off, most of them can emerge. This proves that each instar larva is completely prevented by metamorphic hormone, otherwise they would become adults. This metamorphic hormone also has no species difference. The organ that secretes the hormone is also the corpora allata. Try to cut off the corpora allata of the third-instar or fourth-instar larvae of blood-sucking assassin bugs and transplant them into the bodies of last-instar larvae, and it will produce a huge larva that can never emerge into an adult.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Random Thoughts: The Masses and Discipline <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>by Jing Wen</p>
<p>After watching the two films "Melody of Youth" and "The Great Review," I was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the mass scenes. However, I have a feeling that these neatly marching troops and unified forms, although beautiful, are they really expressing the meaning of united will? Do these seemingly grand scenes represent the union of individual free wills?</p>
<p>The reason why I have such doubts is that in Germany when the Nazis were in power, the mass scenes displayed by the Brownshirts also had the same grand and orderly style. Even under Mussolini, the Fascist "goose step" also had its special formal beauty. These were all propagated at the time as expressions of mass power, the Great Wall formed by united will. But now they have all collapsed.</p>
<p>The above remarks are not biased. I just think that disciplined unity is ultimately not as powerful as the unity of free will. The Spartans of ancient times were the most disciplined people. Although there were nobles, commoners, and slaves in Spartan society, the pure Spartans who were in the position of nobles, under strict disciplinary training, lived a life of hardship that far surpassed the commoners and slaves under them. The private lives of the leaders of the so-called "revolutionary regimes" of the extreme left or extreme right were often extremely ascetic and self-motivated and emphasized "iron discipline" before they succeeded. After taking power, this "iron discipline" was used as a tool to control subordinates. Therefore, all totalitarian countries, in their heyday, often appear as united as iron barrels on the outside. The power of the masses is even expressed as solid as the Great Wall. The "grand" scenes that Hitler manipulated at the Munich Party Congress and the successive Berlin mass rallies deceived the eyes and ears of countless people at the time.</p>
<p>Compared with the Spartans, Athenian society at that time also had nobles and slaves, but one was like a barracks, and the other was like a garden. The Spartans, apart from the heroic tragedy of the Battle of Thermopylae, seem to have left nothing in history. On the other hand, Athens is not only the cradle of Greek culture but also the birthplace of Western European philosophy and literary and artistic thought, making a great contribution to human civilization.</p>
<p>Having said that, I have no intention of slighting "iron discipline" and the power of the masses. Because humans are necessarily social animals and cannot live apart from the group. And in a group society, a certain discipline is necessary. The development of human social civilization to have written or unwritten laws shows that humans themselves have a demand for discipline.</p>
<p>In individual units, discipline is necessary. However, in addition to maintaining order, the most important role of discipline is to awaken the members of a group or society to the self-awareness of morality, which is generally called a sense of responsibility. Such discipline must be built on the basis of the free will of each individual. It must make people understand that the discipline they obey is not an external pressure, but a moral contract they have made with society. Only such discipline can generate true unity.</p>
<p>People who distort liberalism often think that freedom is licentiousness, lack of discipline, and inability to unite. But the lessons of history are almost completely the opposite. Hitler, Mussolini, and a group of Japanese militarists in the past held this view. The discipline they valued was "ten-cheng" style discipline, and the mass power they valued was the orderly form of the Brownshirts or Blackshirts. The countries of the free world were, in their eyes, a disorganized crowd that was vulnerable to attack. This increased their confidence in this regard because of the repeated defeats of liberal countries such as Britain and France at the beginning of the war. But they did not expect that the people of liberal countries would also have mass power and the discipline of a wartime country, and they exerted an effect that they did not expect.</p>
<p>The power of the masses is great, and discipline also has a restraining effect. However, if one relies solely on the restraint of discipline to manipulate the power of the masses while neglecting the development of individual free will, sooner or later one will inevitably repeat the mistakes of people like Hitler and Mussolini, resulting in the tragic outcome of the tree falling and the monkeys scattering.</p>
<p>Finally, I must state that this article is only my personal feeling about general phenomena and has nothing to do with the two films mentioned. It is only used as an introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Sequel to "Flowers of Shanghai": The Author, the Old Man of Yan Valley <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>by Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>The author of "Sequel to Flowers of Shanghai," the Old Man of Hua Valley, surnamed Zhang, styled Yinnan, and named, also known as Mang Gong, Layman of Mang's Nest, and in his later years, he lived in Yan Garden, so he also called himself the Old Man of Yan Valley. His original name was Cheng, a native of Changshu. He was a Jinshi in the Qing Guangxu Jia Chen period, an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a recording imperial censor, and a consul in Kobe, Japan and Incheon, Korea. During the palace examination, the reading ministers presented ten volumes, and the old man ranked first. Because his countermeasures advocated constitutionalism, he disobeyed the will of Empress Dowager Cixi and was suppressed to the first place in the third class. He lost the first prize, which was a pity for those who heard about it. During the turmoil, his cousin, Mr. Nan Tie, obtained his palace examination paper at a cold stall, and I once saw it.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Grand Historian Shen Beishan impeached the three villains (Gang Yi, Rong Lu, and Li Lianying), and his upright voice shook the world. The draft was actually written by the old man. I will write another article about this.</p>
<p>During the Ding Chou Rebellion, the old man fled to Guilin and broke a foot on the way. When he arrived in Shanghai, he lived with Master Shen Peiwei. For several years, he could not go downstairs. In his later years, he became more and more impoverished. His only son died early, and he had only one daughter, who married Shao. His grandson, Yanqing, was living with his daughter at that time. He sold the remaining calligraphy and paintings to make a living. The novel "Sequel to Flowers of Shanghai," which he wrote, was first introduced and published in the Beiping Zhonghe Monthly and received a small amount of royalties. Later, a certain bookstore published it as a separate book, but he did not receive a penny. It is said that the sales were not bad, and the old man's daughter did not want to pursue the matter, but she was fortunate that her father's writings could be passed down immortal. The old man also translated the Yuan Secret History, which was published in the Guoxue Lunheng. He also had manuscripts and notes, which were all stored in the Ting family.</p>
<p>The year before last, I bought the old man's hand-corrected "Complete Works of Shangu" at the Cungu Bookstore in Suzhou. He carefully examined it with vermilion ink, and no stroke was left uncorrected. Master Yang Wuyang and Master Mengshao each wrote a postscript, saying that they had seen the old man's hand-annotated "Cheng Weishi Lun," "Han Changli," "Wang Linchuan," and "Mei Wanling" collections in the past. They were scattered during the turmoil, and I don't know where they were transferred. People know that the old man's poetry admired Yuxi, but in fact, he used a lot of effort on Shangu. Shangu and Jinggong both came from Yuxi, and the old man certainly got his secret.</p>
<p>This spring, I went to the old man's former residence, Ying Garden. After the war, it was desolate and overgrown with weeds, and I could not overcome the feeling of the past and the present. The old man once had a garden poem: "Sitting and lying in a barren garden for twenty springs, white pine and blue stone are free from dust. The old man tries his best to maintain it, leaving it for others to love and protect in the future." The old man was deeply versed in internal Buddhist scriptures and knew that all laws are empty, and when the cause is exhausted, it will perish. However, the white-haired students who come here cannot help but feel sad.</p>

<h3 id="e39">The Disgrace of the Twentieth Century <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>by Li Chu</p>
<p>Although the twentieth century is an era of freedom and equality, the problem of racial discrimination still exists in the United States today.</p>
<p>In the southern United States, the black and white divide is very strict. Black people cannot enter white schools; black people have a "special carriage" on trains; theaters, churches, and other public places have separate entrances and seats for blacks and whites. If a black person mistakenly enters the white entrance, it is "deserved," but if a white person mistakenly enters the black entrance, there are also "thousands of prohibitions." Not long ago, Senator Taylor, a campaign aide to Wallace, was charged with disturbing public order by the security authorities for insisting on entering through the black entrance at a black gathering in Birmingham. As a result, the court sentenced him to a fine of fifty dollars and 180 days in detention, but the detention portion was suspended.</p>
<p>What is even more painful is that black people are also subject to interference when they buy property in white areas. A black builder named Shelley in St. Louis bought a house in a white area. As soon as he moved in, he was sued by the surrounding "white neighbors." As a result of the lawsuit, Shelley was able to preserve his property, but he had exhausted his energy. It can be seen that what is not a problem for white people—such as buying property—has become a "big problem" for black people.</p>
<p>Are black people so annoying? White people always say they are stupid, unclean, and morally depraved. Even if uncleanness and moral depravity are facts, they may be caused by economic and social factors; stupidity is not necessarily the case. In recent years, the achievements of black people in literature, music, engineering, and other fields have proved that they are not stupid. There is a genius school in New York that admits highly intelligent genius children, and there are also black people among them.</p>
<p>These kinds of prejudices are undoubtedly obstacles to civilized progress. But looking to the future, there is still no hope of improvement. Recently, Dr. Malan of the National Party won the general election in South Africa. One of the policies he advocates is to more thoroughly implement the segregation of whites and colored people. This is a reverse current of the times and a shame for "civilized people."</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Golden World of the United States of America <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The golden world of the United States of America has its natural value and endowment, and its artificial historical efforts. The resources of that land are particularly rich, and industry and science are second to none in the world. Therefore, it owns 90% of the global gold rate and is strong. Its luxury of all enjoyments is indeed something that is done without doing it, and it cannot be imitated by force. Moreover, Western fables and novels already have stories satirizing gold worship, briefly saying that one person is busy with gold all day long, and the residence is nothing but gold. Gradually, the five senses and limbs also turn into gold, and then become a useless person who cannot speak or move. This is indeed a refreshing elixir for those who are trapped in material things. Moreover, China is poor and weak, and after a great disaster, it only sees the wealth of neighboring countries, following step by step, which is inevitably too naive. It is said that the confiscated traitorous property in Shanghai has countless gemstones and gold, which shows that people are blinded and only know that more money is better, and they do not know how to enjoy it or how to control it. Just like the villain in the play "Picking Up Gold" and Zhang Wang in the play "Greedy Joy," they hold a large amount of silver but don't know what to do with it. It is a full description of the parvenu! Old bureaucrats such as Sheng Xuanhuai were not only profit-oriented and made countless fortunes, but they used them for self-enjoyment, for charity, for education and culture, and for contributing to the Empress Dowager, all in an orderly manner. This is called "spending what you have seen." This matter also has a distinction between "experts" and "old hands," and the difference between new and old rich people lies in this.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Beginning and End of the New Stele of Hanshan Temple <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>by Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The painter Wu Hufan is recovering from illness and is said to have been discharged from the hospital. Yesterday, I went to visit him. On the wall was a rubbing of the new stele of Hanshan Temple, tall, beautiful, and vigorous. The ink color was as clear as a child's eyes. Looking at it, I had the joy of escaping from thoughts and flying in spirit. I asked Hufan, and I learned that the stele was recently erected in Hanshan Temple in Wuzhong, carved by Huang Huaijue. Hufan entrusted Huaijue to ship it to the temple. After the stele was erected, the abbot of the temple sent a letter to Hufan to express his gratitude. The stele was written by Zhang Ji of Cangzhou, recording the Tang Dynasty's poem "Moon Sets, Crows Cry, Frost Fills the Sky," written in running script, showing his skills. It also included a postscript saying, "I have long admired the scenic spot of Hanshan Temple. I have traveled back and forth to Wu Dou for many years, but I have not visited it once. Mr. Hufan said that my name is the same as the person who wrote the poem 'Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night' in the Tang Dynasty, so he asked me to write this poem and engrave it on stone. I only take the meaning of lasting fame and truth, and I do not presumptuously imitate the poet." Below is Hufan's postscript: "I said that Mr. Zhang Junquan was the same as Zhang Ji of the Tang Dynasty, so I asked Mr. Pu Boxin to ask him to write the poem 'Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night.' Unexpectedly, after the writing was completed, Duke Pu passed away the next day, so it became his last work. This is also a karmic connection from a previous life. I ordered it to be engraved on stone and erected in the mountains of Hanshan Temple to leave this good story, and I will engrave the two characters of Duke Pu below. This is truly a gift for the historians to preserve."</p>
<p>The letter said: "Mr. Hufan, from Shanghai. Thank you for your kind reception. I have been busy with worldly affairs since we parted, and the incident has not yet been reported. I am deeply sorry for the delay. The poem 'Mooring at Maple Bridge at Night' has been repeatedly urged. Because Zhang Pulao has been too tired recently, he finished writing it only three days ago, and he passed away the next night. This paper is really his last work. The colleagues at the History Museum wanted to keep it. Then, because Duke's feelings for this paper are beyond description, he should send the original to you.

<h3 id="e43">How to Suppress the Rising Tide of Prices! <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Prices eased slightly in late May, but on the 4th and 5th of this month, prices in Nanjing and Shanghai began to stir again. According to Nanjing reports, the highest authorities are paying unusual attention to this. The Executive Yuan has also agreed on countermeasures to suppress the rising tide, which will be implemented in sequence. But how to suppress the rising tide of prices? In the past decade, the authorities have tried various methods, such as: (1) price limits, (2) price negotiations, (3) price labeling, (4) selling off reserves, (5) strictly prohibiting speculation and hoarding, (6) tightening credit, (7) restricting exports and re-exports, (8) strictly enforcing supervision and inspection, and (9) implementing rationing. More or less, all of these have been promoted to a considerable extent. However, a glance at the price index tables in various places reveals that these measures have not only been completely ineffective, but have actually intensified the trend of rising prices despite efforts to suppress them. Therefore, if the new Executive Yuan wants to stabilize prices, it must take further steps and make fundamental and prompt remedies.</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called fundamental solutions are well known to everyone, namely two paths: (1) stop printing money; (2) increase production. Because prices are a comparison between currency and goods. If currency continues to inflate while the supply of goods cannot meet demand, then no amount of skill can forcibly suppress prices. Regarding the cessation of currency inflation, we have advocated using the proceeds from the sale of US aid goods to make up for the deficit in public finances, thereby alleviating the issuance of new currency. Recent statements from relevant authorities have also largely advocated this. If agreement can be reached with the US, it seems that there will be no major problems on this path. Furthermore, on the day of his inauguration, the new Minister of Finance, Wang, also declared that the Ministry of Finance's administration would still focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. If this statement can be truly realized, and supplemented by the aforementioned US aid, we believe that at least in the short term, currency inflation, even if it cannot be completely stopped, can at least be temporarily eased, and there is always hope.</p>
<p>However, how to effectively promote increased production remains to be seen and requires much effort. The movement to increase production is not a new concept. Slogans and plans for increasing grain production, cotton production, silk cocoon production, etc., have long been familiar to everyone. However, in recent years, the actual numbers have not shown a significant increase. Moreover, the various products that can be obtained are often stranded in the fields due to obstacles such as banditry and transportation, and cannot be smoothly processed or reach the final consumer. When they fortunately reach the manufacturing stage, they often encounter imbalances in supply and demand and suffer from stagnation and slow sales due to various unreasonable controls, power, machinery, and funding constraints. On the surface, the movement to increase production is vigorously promoted, but in reality, it is being forced in the direction of reduced production. Coupled with the abundance of speculative capital and rampant speculation, how can the rising tide of prices be curbed? But from our perspective, in order to adjust supply and demand and stabilize prices, the following four measures must be effectively implemented in the future to increase production:</p>
<p>First, stabilize the production environment, including improving labor-management relations, improving conscription and grain policies, and strengthening local security. The goal is to ensure that those engaged in production, whether farmers or workers, can work with peace of mind and be happy to serve the public, and that entrepreneurs can operate freely within the framework of reasonable laws and regulations, without any worries. Only in this way can various production undertakings proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Second, alleviate the suffering of merchants and the people. On the surface, all government measures are intended to benefit merchants and the people. Words such as "encouragement," "promotion," and "assistance" are everywhere. In reality, however, the benefits to merchants and the people are far less than the pain of being bound and exploited. This is partly due to poor implementation and partly due to incomplete legislation. The Legislative Yuan should immediately make sweeping reforms, thoroughly eliminating all cumbersome, harsh, repetitive, and meaningless laws and procedures, and truly start anew with the people, so that merchants and the people feel a sense of intimacy and love towards the government, and do not harbor suspicion and oppression. Only then can government and business genuinely cooperate and production be actively promoted.</p>
<p>Third, reduce the burden on merchants and the people. During this period of constitutional government and suppression of rebellion, expenses are enormous, and taxes are especially needed. It is naturally necessary to actively increase revenue and tax collection, as Minister Wang said, in order to avoid a sharp increase in currency issuance. This is something that the public can understand and accept. The great concerns are: (1) tax rates are sometimes too high, hindering production and causing the so-called "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs" phenomenon; (2) overlapping and repetitive taxation; (3) ostensibly implementing control measures but actually seeking profit, allowing general officials to use their positions to engage in petty calculations; (4) various localities arbitrarily establish names and arbitrarily levy taxes and donations without limit. Various public and private apportionments are especially novel and endless. This not only increases costs, making it impossible for producers and consumers to bear the burden, but also demands without limit, making it impossible to calculate costs, further delivering a fatal blow to producers.</p>
<p>Fourth, increase the convenience of finance. As a result of the sharp decline in deposits due to currency inflation, the financial resources of general commercial banks are now greatly diminished compared to the past. To promote the activities of industry and commerce and the smooth progress of production undertakings, national banks cannot but adopt more proactive measures, channeling funds through commercial banks as much as possible to maximize the effectiveness of finance. The current policy of tightening credit, while not without temporary effects in terms of addressing the symptoms, has caused commerce to stagnate and production to inevitably be hindered. Moreover, tightening and loosening credit from time to time only makes legitimate merchants exhausted and unwilling to operate freely, while speculators can take advantage of the intermittent weaknesses, which runs counter to the goal of stabilizing prices. As for restricting domestic remittances and restricting the transportation of cash, this is tantamount to building a high levee in the middle of the exchange of goods, preventing the free exchange of raw materials and finished products, which is especially incompatible with the movement to increase production.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Mystery of Pyramid-Shaped, Huge Structure: Rumors of Discovery in Guanzhong, But No Factual Proof <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Xi'an dispatch, 6th] Foreign media have repeatedly exaggerated the story that a pyramid-shaped, huge structure exists in Guanzhong and was recently discovered from the air by a foreign pilot. There is no factual proof here, and many believe that this may be just a "Uncle Sam" publicity stunt. General Cha Fei, who is familiar with the aerial topography of this area, told reporters that he and his colleagues were initially interested in this and often took the opportunity to explore, but have not found any trace of it. However, there is a small hill in the southwest of the Qinling Mountains, namely the Zhongnan Mountains, that is slightly geometric in shape, which may be the source of this rumor. Another archaeological expert believes that it may be a mistaken reference to a certain imperial tomb, such as the Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang at the foot of Lishan Mountain in Lintong, which is 1,200 feet high and round at the top and square at the bottom, or the Maoling Mausoleum of Emperor Wu in Xingping County, which is 300 feet square. Both have square bases similar to the huge pyramid-shaped structures that we know of. As for the "pyramid" recently discovered, with its four sides painted in four different colors of red, green, etc., as reported by foreigners, this may be seen in a Disney color cartoon, but there would never be such a groundbreaking construction in ancient or even modern China.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Wuxi dispatch, 6th] All cocoon exchanges in the county have reopened. In addition to the guidance association paying for the loans, manufacturers have decided to pay for the excess part themselves. However, the cocoon exchanges are deserted and receive very little, because farmers have mostly dried the fresh cocoons and are unwilling to sell them at low prices.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Kunming Observation Post Newspaper Destroyed by Students <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Kunming dispatch, 6th] Before the incident of the destruction of the Fuxing Evening News by Kunhua Agricultural School was over, the Kunming Observation Post was surrounded on the evening of the 5th by Duan Yishen, a military training instructor from Kunhua Commercial School, and 145 students. The business department was completely destroyed, and slogans such as "Observation is not clear, investigation is not bright" were written in large characters with asphalt. Afterwards, Zhang Dajun, the interview director of the newspaper, was kidnapped and imprisoned in a small house in the school. They shouted slogans along the way, with a fierce momentum. Military police stopped them to no avail. The cause of the incident was that the newspaper published a reader's letter on May 19, stating that a certain vocational school's dean of academics, Liu, and a staff member, Luo, had an ambiguous relationship. After it was published, Kunhua Commercial School sent a letter to the newspaper for correction. After the newspaper complied, this atrocity suddenly occurred half a month later. Members of the news profession are indignant about this and unanimously support the newspaper. They convened an emergency meeting of the press association to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that the Observation Post was founded by Long Chunwu, the eldest son of former Chairman Long Yun. Relevant authorities also attach great importance to this.</p>

<p>2.8 Billion Yuan for a Chartered Plane</p>
<p>A Family of Six Flew to Shanghai</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan dispatch, 6th] After the interruption of the Jinpu Railway, all foreign transportation in Jinan relies on air routes. Passengers who have registered with various airlines to go south to Nanjing and Shanghai must wait three months to complete their journey. Those going north to Beiping and Tianjin, and east to Qingdao, must also wait one and a half months. Therefore, black market ticket prices have risen as high as 100 million per ticket. On the 6th, Huabei News, which has the largest circulation here, also reported that a wealthy family of six chartered a plane to Shanghai, with a charter price of 2.8 billion, plus an introduction fee of 200 million.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou dispatch, 6th] According to the Guangdong Provincial Grain Administration: rice in various counties of Guangdong has been harvested, and new rice has appeared on the market in counties near the city. Although the rainy season was slightly late this spring, it did not affect most areas except for a few counties in Qiongyai. The office has not received any reports of poor harvests from any counties. If there are no storms within half a month, then this year's rice crop can be said to be a bumper harvest. The current grain prices have obviously stabilized, and the period of transition between the green and yellow has passed safely.</p>
