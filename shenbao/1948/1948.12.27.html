<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿六日電〕急景凋年，新年挾無數國際問號俱來之際，日本在美國戰略思慮中日益重要。不可避免而極自然地，中國與此思慮聯爲一氣。華盛頓之眼光中，日本之將來絞中國爲光明。歲暮檢討日本與亞洲之關係時，兩大問題應之而起，其一爲日本和約，另一爲日本在整個政策中之地位及技術。第三個問題又因之而生，卽日本成爲防共障碍之可能性，合衆社與政府各方面討論之結果，表示目前華府之觀點如次：日本和約在短期內成立絕無可能。</p>
<p>四強迄今並未表示有改變立塲使和約得　起草之跡象。美國原來主張起草和約時採三分之二多數通過制，中蘇兩國力表反對，堅持保留否決權，可靠方面稱，此一局面依然和此，雙方均無願意妥協之表示。消息靈通人士將日本與德國局面相提並論，兩者均需要和約，然東西「冷戰」依目前程度進行時，兩者均不可能得到和約。彼等稱，反之，若蘇聯主宰之世界與西方民主國間之劍拔弩張局勢能有某一程度之好轉，則各方面情勢均可比例好轉，若對德和約有望成立，對日和約亦可水到渠成，反之亦然，一不成則兩敗。</p>
<p>第二個問題是美國對華政策，吾人極難乎指中美關係某一階段而稱：「看啊，這就是對華政策」。被詢闡述美國對華政策時，國務院官員勸發問者參閱杜魯門·馬歇爾及國務院自一九四五年以來所發表文告及國會對援華法案之措施，無論公開或私下，官方均拒作具體表示，國務副卿羅維特在記者招待會中宣布，美國政策不變，仍根據國會之決定—卽承認國民政府及執行若干特別之援助。羅氏向詢問者數度强調，美國未改變其對華政策，然渠不願再多發一言，一記者稱以其記憶所及，最近一次美國政策聲明，主張中國各黨合作，包括中共，羅氏則稱其記憶並不正確。</p>

<h3 id="c29">呼籲荷蘭立即停戰 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>荷蘭不惜破壞神的停戰協定，於本月十八日以其精銳部隊言先向印尼共和國首都日惹，發動最猛烈的攻勢，使持續三年之久的荷印衝突的戰火死灰復燃，以致引起全世界愛好和平人士的憤慨與各國輿情的腿責；就是荷蘭的友邦美國，對於荷蘭在東印度羣島之所爲，也不能不指斥爲侵略的行動。聯合國安全理事會在巴黎開會，討論荷印問題，各會員國代表莫不嚴詞譴責，蘇聯代表要求對荷蘭實施「制裁」，澳洲代表更堅決主張將荷蘭逐出聯合國，安理會至最後始通過中美兩國所贊同的議案，即命令荷印雙方立即停戰；並決定將此一問題列入今日之議程內，以調查荷蘭是否運守此停戰令。</p>
<p>在聯合國尚未能成爲維持世界和平的有效機構之今日，安全會僅能作此決議，原是未可厚非的。但此一紙命令能否使印尼境內化干戈爲玉帛，則不能不視荷印雙方的態度如何而定了。據合衆社巴達維亞廿五日電稱：印尼共和政府對於接受停戰令，巳提出五項條件：（一）立即釋放印尼共和國領袖；（二）撤退軍隊至十二月十八日以前之防綫；（三）在事實上及法理上承認印尼共和國在爪哇，蘇門答臘及馬都拉三邦之主權；（四）組織一個不受荷蘭干涉之獨立印尼國家；（五）在新政府成立後，荷蘭駐軍應全部撇退回國。我們不論從那一個角度去觀察印尼所提出的五項條件，大概可以認爲『合理』；而且我們更相信，這五項條件，不僅是停戰的先決條件，而且也是荷印衝突能否合理解決的前提。所以印尼的戰火能否立即熄滅，完全要以荷蘭的態度爲斷了。</p>
<p>荷蘭軍事當局以海陸空三軍進攻印尼首都日惹，雖然也會以「反共」爲護符，但是荷蘭終不能以一手掩盡天下耳目。印度尼西亞運動的本質，是一種要求自由，平等，獨立，的民族解放運動，而不是具有國際性的共產革命，這是天下所共知的。荷蘭政府並不能以「將爲共黨所利用」爲理由，拒不接受安理會的停戰令的。但是荷蘭憑其海陸空三軍的優勢，對於印尼至今猶抱着對待殖民地的態度，旣已輕肇戰禍於先，自也難望其率爾接受停戰令於後。荷蘭內閣將召開緊急會議，討論安理會的停戰令，恐仍是抱着一意孤行到底的態度，亳無悔悟棄戰言和的跡象。我們因此，不得不爲印尼人民担憂，而對我國無數僑胞將遭池魚之殃，更小能不表示無限的關切。</p>
<p>拋開荷印問題的本身勿論，即以其對於東南亞以至對整個世界而言，荷蘭如若拒不接受安理會的停戰令，則其影響所及，也是不可思議的。第一，安理會的決議，對於荷蘭如猶不能發生效力。則其威信掃地，莫過於此，今後還有誰再願相信它是維持世界和平的有效機構？安理會爲維持其威信起見，勢必考慮到對於荷蘭實施制裁的問題，果兩則聯合國機構又將遭遇一空前未有的嚴重考騐了。第二，展望亞洲的局勢，實已嚴重到極點，再也不可讓印尼的戰火死灰復燃。誰都知道今日的亞洲，幾巳沒有一片安樂土，東北亞巳在共產國際的控制之下，中國則瀕於「赤化」的邊緣，東南亞也已感受共產國際的威脅。偉大的國際政治家若不從「和平繁榮」方面着手，促進東南亞各國的安定，則東南亞也遲早不免投入「鐵幕」之內。荷蘭對印尼用兵，雖以「反共」爲護符，但其用兵的結果，恐將適得其反，徒使印尼更適宜於作爲共產主義的溫牀。所以，我們爲東南亞的安定計，同時也爲整個亞洲免於浩刦計，不得不向荷蘭當局呼籲，立即接受安理會的停戰令，然後再以和平的方法與外交的途徑，覓致荷印間題合理解決的方案！</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿六日電〕印尼臨時政府電台今日廣播稱，荷軍倘先退至淮攻前陣地，印尼亦當下令停戰以爲報答。荷軍並應釋放被拘之印尼總統蘇卡諾與總理哈泰。據此問印尼人士構，臨時政府設在吉羅浦島，曾獲得哈泰總理之委託。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿六日電〕聯合國調解委會廿六日電告安理會稱：「安理會雖下令調解會監視印尼之軍事行動，然事實上殊不可能。電文指出分界綫已不復存在，而調解會亦無法正確區別印荷軍事行動與荷蘭之保安措施。電文稱：「本會將盡其可能執行所賦予之職權…，然若談判代替戰事，本會一致承認若干不可避免之困難須先克復…，本會各員僅對上述困難之重量，稍有歧見…。事實上，際此分界綫已不再存在之時，印尼共和軍之地位實已無法確定，蓋荷軍已攻俘印尼最高指揮部。職是之故，本會或須注意爪哇。蘇門答臘及馬都拉三島全境之任何軍事性質行動，此事本身卽極難判斷荷蘭之保安措施與印荷雙方戰爭間之區別。」電文又控訴荷方違反停戰協定之第十款，蓋荷方之作戰聲明係交與在巴達維亞之美國委員，而不逕交駐加里阿蘭之調解會主席。又稱：其時該會主席已獲通知而悉「荷軍之越現狀綫在共和國境內作戰巳有三日有餘。」調解會又控訴荷蘭不依停戰協定，將軍事行動通知共和國。電文指出，「送抵共和國代表團秘書長之通知，並非第十款所規定之照會形式，特別是其時荷政府已切斷與共和國境之電訊，是故荷方函件之內容，絕對無法知照共和國政府，其後不久，上述秘書長本人亦被逮捕…。」調解會電文結語稱：「停戰協定仍全部有效之時，荷蘭政府於廢除該協定時未提有效之通知，荷軍亦卽越過現狀綫而對印尼共和國發動敵對性軍事行動。」</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿五日電〕荷蘭軍隊今日不顧聯合國之停戰令，佔據印尼共和國最後大城末里勞，並據有幾乎全部爪哇。蘇門答臘大部份亦入於荷軍之手。印尼軍隊已退入深山。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿五日電〕荷軍司令部廿五日宜佈已佔領末里勞。末里勞卽係九月間印尼共黨起事十二日之地點，位於巴達維亞以東約三三五哩，爲中爪哇之重要公路及鐵路之交叉點。荷蘭自佔領末里勞後，現已擁有爪哇全境之一切主要城市及公路。荷軍司令部並宣佈，荷軍現在過去一週內所佔領之整個區域內，開始大規模之掃蕩工作，此點表示爪哇戰事現已變成荷軍與流動遊擊隊間之戰事。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴達維亞廿五日電〕目前共和軍能完全控制之地區爲東爪哇之末里勞一帶，自荷軍全面進攻後，末里勞之共和國軍隊己與共產軍合作，予荷軍以頑强之抵抗。聯合軍之總司令爲泰馬拉卡，渠在十二月二十一日曾作廣播演說，强調抵抗到底。另一方而在荷軍完全達到其目的，卽將印尼軍完全肅淸前，願否服從安理會之停戰令，亦極可懷疑。</p>

<p>〔中央社新德里廿五日電〕印度總理尼赫魯與海德拉巴王公，已於海德拉巴境內互相舉行其生平第一次禮貌訪問。海邦王公　訪印度總理於前英國駐舊官署，係打破海邦一世紀以來之習俗，尼赫魯於王公允予接見時，朱付硬幣亦爲破例。綠貴客訪海邦王公，例須獻款。衆信尼赫魯之訪海邦，係與在該邦之政治機構有關。該邦社會黨將向尼氏提出由四千同道者簽名，內容爲要求立卽廢立王公之備忘錄一份，海邦境內之國大黨則欲早日組織臨時政府，以代替該邦內之軍政府，</p>

<p>旋由公用局局長趙曾玨致詞，强調技術人才，應如「士敏土」之有凝結力，趙氏亦提出三點，指示技術人才應循之方向，渠謂：第一『生產落後爲戰亂之源』：中國五十年來一直在水深火熱之中，並且一直在求自由平等而實際上一直不可得，其主要原因，卽由於生產落後與缺乏技術，此一者是互爲因果的。倘僅就技術觀點而論，所以生產落後與缺乏技術，其原因在於一般人士朱曾認識技術之重要，而技術人士自己亦未曾認識本身對於國家的責任。在砲火連天的今日，談技術救國，當然並非空言以求解決國是的意思，而是應當從今以後認定發展生產與發展技術的重要。堅決實行起來，因爲目前的戰亂必有停止之日的。過去因爲生產落後，所以有今日的戰亂，我們要保體以後不再有戰亂，就應當發展生產與發展技術。</p>

<p>第二『技術人士應加强團結，實現民生計劃』：中國要發展生產，凡技術人土必須團結起來，以集體力量進行之。我們從自己的經驗與別人的經騐中，已經認識我們祗有用「計劃經濟」的方式，來發展生產，來解決民生，最能獲得速效，這就是所謂『迎頭趕上」的方法。因此，我們技術人干爲配合解決民生的「計劃經濟」起見，應當在一個目標之下團結起來，使那個「計劃」能實現，換言之，讓我們來推動那個「計劃」·我們國家所缺少的就是在民族利益與國家利益上的團結，允其按術人士仍然多數保守着「獨善其身」的傳統觀念，對於『團結』還不能身體力行。這個缺點，我們以後一定要把它糾正。</p>
<h3 id="c68">技術爭取　自由平等 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>第三『要用技術來爭取自由平等』：技術的意義就是「利用厚生」此處之「生」是「民生」，也是「人生」，它的涵義極爲廣泛，換言之，技術應當爲全人類服務，這是它的饅高目標。不過在它發展的程序上，應當先從自己的國家做起來。因爲技術的目的是爲「民生」而不是爲戰爭，所以它可從自己的國家再推到世界，這就是大同世界。大同世界是「各盡所能，各取所需」。此二者，前者是「予」，後者是「取」，應當互相對待的。倘使我們只「取」而不「予」，這表示我們尚不能獨立，只能做別人的「附庸」，而大同世界亦永遠不能到達。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕漁管處漁輪漁康號（卽康納鐵根號）失事後，被難船員家屬一再要求漁管處從速辦理各項善後事宜，及追究責任問題，然迄無具體辦法。昨日浙江省立水產學校同學會及被難家屬代表招待本市各報社記者，報告失事前後，並向社會呼籲聲援。略謂：該輸於十月十五日由闕肇沅代理船長率領，自沈家門駛出時，曾與漁新輪互撞，船首受傷漏水，當略加修理，至廿一日闕代船長檢查後，發覺仍有漏水現象，電向總船長室請示，要求返航大修，但未被准許，乃繼續出漁。嗣後該輸王景昇船長再度請求修理，仍未獲准。本月二日受命勉强出漁，行前王船長對上級不許修理而令受損之輪出海撈漁，藐視漁員安全極表不滿，會表示此次返航後，卽行辭職。</p>
<p>不堪海浪襲擊　三次發電求救</p>
<p>該樂輸遂於本月一一日由滬出海，至十三日下午六時卅分，漁管處氣象台循例報告天氣預測稱風力一〇—八節，此爲海上極尋常之風力。十四日上午風力稍强，浪亦漸高，王船長以電話告誡在同一區域作業之友輸漁惠漁蘇號船長云，氣候轉惡，風浪漸大，應加戒備，希拔網避風，請君等先行，我後一小時起網，當殿後而行，此可證明王船畏經騐之豐富。九時許拔網方畢，船首傷痕不堪海浪襲擊，裂痕漏水，遂先後於十時許，十一時十五分，十一時四十分發出緊急求救電話三次，而漁管處電台竟未曾收到一次；至下午二時，在北洋作業之漁輸漁津號向漁管處靑島分處報告云：上海漁輪漁康號遇險曾呼救，始被漁管處復興島電台於無意中聽到，此時總船長臨時束手無策，一誤再誤，終至失事沉沒。</p>
<p>從容更衣待死　足證沉沒遲緩</p>
<p>按漁康號於十一時四十分發出最後求救電訊，迄下午五時牟，尚有在同海面遇險帆船老大戚阿英，目繫尚未完全沉沒，船員均集登駕駛室田板待援，足證其沉沒速度之緩慢，且自撈獲水手蔣阿祥之屍體觀察，身上所穿外衣內衣，均係新換，足穿新皮鞋，均非作業時之衣履，足證當時在遇險時，曾竭力自救，至最後絕望時，方從容換新靜待死神之光臨。此一事實，亦爲沉沒緩慢之明證，而漁管處始於十五日晨通知海面漁輪往救。據聞並託中國航空公司滬台班以飛機順道協助搜索，嗣據該公司稱，在東經一百二十二度四十五分北緯二十八度四十五分處發現沉船，並稱，船首尾點有白燈二　，然旣稱沉船，何以再有燃點白燈，顯係消息不確，而總副船長劉景漢等竟又誤認爲喜訊，以爲船負可以脫險，一誤再誤，至十六日，非特救生無望，且屍體亦無法撈獲。代表等並評此次不幸事件之造成，與漁管處之人事上之不健全極有關係，總船長室電台職員均應負責云。</p>

<h3 id="c94">嘉興芽穀折征之謎 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　陳劍雄</p>
<p>〔本報嘉興廿三日訊〕富興最近發生了一件田賦折幣的一迷案』，雖經人民向參議會請願，和參議員致函議長副，轉請糧政當局公佈，前後發展已達二月有餘，而糧政當局却始終以「不開不問」態度拖延釋明，其所抱主張，頗使各界人土引爲驚疑。</p>
<p>稻穀受水抽芽盈寸</p>
<p>正當入秋早稻收劃的前夕，天不作美，風雨連棉，河水侵入了稻田，不但無法放水，趕抽亦所不及，以致結實飽滿的稻穗傾跌，榖子受水後抽芬盈寸，早稻區的農民，頓時起了騷動，紛紛向縣請願，當局除了撫慰與調查以外，深惑焦慮的是新賦開征時的成數問題。據調查結果這次水災受害的稻田（早稻區）一二七，〇〇〇畝，减少的收獲量達一八〇，四○〇擔。（按全縣水田一，〇九四，七四四畝，每畝平均生產以四擔計算爲四，三七七，五九入，八七六擔）。</p>
<p>折幣完賦皆在歡喜</p>
<p>早稻區鄕鎭旣受此重災，且「芽穀」又不合部頒賦穀的標準，未能繳納田賦，農民就根本無穀完糧。因此，縣田糧處奉令九月一日早稻區開征新賦的工作，無形中就受到了阻碍。爲了謀一補救辦法，及接受地方人士之意見，所以當時縣糧政當局簽請省處，准予以法幣折征，省方爲了體卹農民的困難，准如所請，惟規定折征的數額不得超過三萬石，每石折價爲金圓八元一角，雖當時地方人士認爲折價太高，請求核减，過後，未免有些「得寸進尺」之嫌，亦未予力爭，如此，則糧政人員與農民，莫不皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>按照賦額平均分配</p>
<p>當時縣田糧處，以三萬担折征賦谷，依照早稻區各鄉鎭負担的賦額，平均分配，計鳳橋一二·五〇〇石，棲凰八·〇〇〇石，主店四。八〇〇石，步雲二·五〇〇石，城東二·二〇〇石。因爲開征的時期，適在十月中旬，正是實施「八一九」限價的時候，斯時米價糙更僅每石金圓十六元六角七分，折合每石稻榖入元一角，相差不遠，（然黑市的糙獲價格，却已超過了廿元以上），所以以八元一角作爲一石稻穀繳納田賦，確實尚稱合算。據各收納倉的報告，納賦者頗爲踴躍，不數日各鄉鎭頓告額滿。</p>
<p>流言指摘黃牛操縱</p>
<p>問題就來了，各方流言紛起，指摘頗多，說收納倉有「黃牛操縱」？「以各收納倉現有人事，整日收納，亦難在三日內卽告足額」？其實這種流言，很可以立刻消滅，祗要各收納倉將征起的糧戶名單在當地公佈一下，流言就不攻自破，可是糧政當局，沒有這樣做，仍是「裝襲作啞」，不作一些表示，於是更引起各方的懷疑。</p>
<p>糧政當局無所表示</p>
<p>流言的後背後就有了行動，在十一月十九日那天，當地的二張大報上發現了「一個不怕麻煩的老百姓」致參議會的請願書，洋洋大篇，內容元全指摘這次折征的許多弊病，最後，建議三點：（一）請糧政當局迅速公佈折征糧戶名單。（二）戶名下應寫明所收款數及畝數。（三）料正催糧員的不法行爲。繼而又發表了（十二月十三日）參議員鄭松齡致函議長副的一對公開信，大意謂：「……據聞早稻區各田糧辦事處征收折幣田賦，爲時甚暫，卽聲言滿額，以致外問頗多流言，據謂此次折幣實收數字，僅一萬二千餘石，朱滿之數，似有舞弊之嫌，是項傳聞，是否空谷來風，固不可知，惟爲征賦工作順利起見，擬請建議縣田糧處轉飭各早稻區辦事處將征收折幣之各糧戶姓名及實收數字，卽速公佈，以昭大信。」</p>
<p>但是糧政當局一太過去「置若罔聞」的能度，不理不睬，現在新任巳經接事，今後田糧處的人事，恐將有所更動，這一件擱置下的「迷案」，將在何日揭曉，實使各界「不勝企待之至！」</p>
<h3 id="c95">黔省實施新法植桐 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟癡</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿一日航訊〕我國植桐歷史甚爲悠久，唐時，「本草拾遺」卽有紀載：「罌子生山中，樹似捂。」所謂罌子者，卽桐樹之一種。降及宋明，栽培漸盛，宋陳翦著有「桐譜」一書，凡十篇，開植桐之先聲。明洪武下令種桐漆棕於南京錘山之陽，凡五十萬畝，足見爲政者已知其重要而加以提倡。</p>
<p>桐樹屬大戟科油桐類，爲落葉喬木，其種類甚多，農林部中央農業實騐所卽選得有五百餘種。桐實所榨成之桐油，品種亦至複雜，普通分爲四種：卽桐油·光油·洪油·秀油是。其中桐油又以色分，白桐油以川東·湘西·黔東北所產爲最馳名，品質極佳，多銷國外，其輸出價值在我國全部商品輸出總值上地位之高，自抗戰勝利迄今，歷年仍保持不衰。</p>
<p>丘陵地帶植桐最宜</p>
<p>桐樹爲邱陵地帶之經濟作物，並不見於廣漠之平原，其高度以海拔二〇〇〇公尺爲限，最低亦須在二〇〇公尺以上。川東海拔在二五〇至一五〇〇公尺問者，爲最普遍，湘西及黔東北則均在海拔四〇〇至一五〇〇公尺間，故此三角地帶之地勢，士壞，氣溫，較全國任何地區均爲最適宜於桐樹之生長與結實之豐碩。</p>
<p>烏江流域產桐中心</p>
<p>就貴州而言桐樹分佈幾遍全省，據農林部中央農業實騐所調查研究所得：三十六年貴州省桐樹栽培面積，約佔四十餘萬市畝，桐油收穫量爲二十五萬六千餘市擔，全省各烏江流域之修文·沿河·思南等十一一縣，錦江淸水江流域之銅仁·鎭遠·錦屏等八縣，雲霧山地區之貴定·都勻·羅甸等七縣，北盤江流域之貞豐·關嶺·冊亨等七縣，赤水河流域之仁懷·赤水等兩縣，均爲產桐之著名區域，其中以烏江流域區為最重要，此不啻為貴州桐油之生產中心。黔省桐油之集散市塲，亦以此區域爲最主要，經年北運重慶，東運常德，或南運梧州出口，無時或息，裨益農村經濟，校之近年勃起之美菸栽種事業，仍有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>協助全省　調查研究</p>
<p>谷正倫主席以本省人民服用所需之花紗布，向賴湖南供給爲隱憂。接政之初，卽以增加本省特產桐油菜油產量爲主要生產建設事業之鵠的，在三年之內，全省增植油桐五萬株爲最高理想。適農林部於民國廿九年曾在黔東北之湄潭縣設置桐茶試騐塲試騐新法栽種，頗爲致效。該部爲配合省地方當局增植油桐與情產桐油之決策，遂特派視察鄧肇華君來黔協助調查研究工作，以期提前實現</p>
<p>新注栽培　成就卓越</p>
<p>據湄潭桐茶試騐塲塲長朱源林與鄧肇華兩君語記者：該塲九年來之理頭苦幹研究，對於烏江流域實施選育優良品種及試騐新法栽培技術，均已獲致卓越成就。品種方而，業已獲得成功者，有中農三十三號之對年桐，及中農十號之三年桐兩種。對年桐於栽種後之第二年，卽可開始結實，第三，四，五，年卽大盛，壽命至少爲十五年。三年桐於栽種後之第三年開始結實，第五，六，七年大盛，壽命可達三十年以上。此二種油桐，在湄潭縣經過九年來之栽培，生長非常良好，亦無何種病害，頗爲當地及附近產桐各縣人民所歡迎，甚至有川東，湘西桐農不遠數百里前去偷竊桐種桐苗者。栽培技術方面，如用芽接枝接等新法，可以提早結實時間，增加桐實產量與含油成分·其他有關技術，該塲亦在不斷實騐研究中。</p>
<p>機械榨油　提高油質</p>
<p>農林部決定明年在貴州全省展開油桐及桐油增產工作，省府最近所組設之物產運銷公司，亦以發展本省桐油對外輸出事業爲三大省外貿易之標的。關於桐油新式壓榨之加工設備，刻正計劃在湄潭隣近之遵義縣設立工廠，採用機械榨油，以淘汰舊式木榨，並可使效率提高，油質臻於上乘。建設織長何　五週前赴綴　粵省當局會商，據悉，此亦爲其任務之一。</p>

<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 26th] The current situation of the three army corps under the command of Du Yuming clearly indicates that it is no longer the key point on the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield. Because the unit has been able to stand firm near Yongcheng, the authorities have also dispelled the plan to send troops to attack north and planned for the unit to go south. The unit is northeast of Yongcheng, with Li's army corps as the rear, Sun's army corps as the left flank, and Qiu's army corps as the right flank, forming a triangular position. Because there are too many wounded soldiers and depleted weaponry, it is more difficult to move south. It is also learned that since the pressure of the bandits on the northern front has been reduced, some remnant bandits have fled to the southern part of Henan. At the moment, the military here is quite concerned about the situation in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 26th] Military news: There is no change in the battle situation here. The Communist Anhui North Independent Brigade has fled to the vicinity of Baojiaji. The Jinpu and Huainan Railways have been clear for days.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 26th] It is learned that since the Bengbu-Suzhou battle came to an end, Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi is still stationed here, planning new deployments. Now that the mission has been completed, he will return to Nanjing in two or three days for a duty report.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 26th] Well-informed sources said today that the Eastern China Nationalist Army Headquarters will merge with Tang Enbo's Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters after relocating south from Bengbu to Chuzhou. It is expected that Liu Zhi will serve as the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] Three government armies arrived in Nanjing on the 26th after moving east from the Bengbu front and were reported to be heading to the canal area in northern Jiangsu to reinforce defenses. These three armies were the 39th and 54th Armies of Li Yannian's 6th Army Corps, and the 18th Army of Huang Wei's Army Corps, led by Hu Lian. These three armies were transported by train from Bengbu to Nanjing and are currently undergoing replenishment and rest in the suburbs of Nanjing in order to return to the front. The Xiaguan ferry and Pukou railway station are filled with these soldiers who fought fiercely with the Communist army for a month and returned fully equipped. It is believed that these three armies will head north to strengthen the government's defenses to prevent the Communist army from spying on the Yangtze River. Soldiers and officers of the three armies marched across the snowy streets of Nanjing on the 22nd to temporary barracks in Tangshan. One soldier replied to a question that they were relieved in Bengbu North by several new armies, including the 20th Army, and came to the Nanjing area for rest. According to reports on the 26th, the lines were quiet to the north of Bengbu and southwest of Xuzhou due to poor weather and muddy battle roads.</p>

<p>[United Press Reporter Jean Lyon, Beiping, 25th] Forty hours ago, this reporter crossed the Nationalist-Communist fire lines in an attempt to visit Yenching University, six miles from the city, and ended up spending 24 hours in a Communist army headquarters besieging Beiping.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, this reporter obtained permission from a Nationalist army commander on the front line to cross the Nationalist army outposts and proceed to the Communist-occupied area. On the way, I met a Communist soldier who helped me safely pass through the Communist-occupied towns and reach Yenching University, where everything was normal and the music never stopped. This reporter had a brief conversation with Acting President Dr. Lu Zhiwei, who said that the Communist army had not yet entered Yenching University, and that the faculty and students were free to move in the suburbs. The Communist political representative in the area once visited the school to speak to the students. Foreign professors are safe and able to continue lecturing with complete freedom.

While at the headquarters, the Communist side treated this reporter with courtesy, and the food and accommodation were good. We chatted casually without any restrictions, but I was told not to reveal the location of the headquarters, military symbols, or any other information before being allowed to return to Beiping. However, this reporter refused to answer, and at noon on the 25th, I returned to the area near Yenching University by Jeep.</p>

When this reporter asked whether the Communist army would shell the city of Beiping, the Communist army refused to answer. This reporter also saw that the Communist army had many light machine guns, machine guns, and light field guns. In the villages where this reporter stayed and where the Communist army was stationed, the situation was normal, and Communist slogans were posted on the walls, including "Down with British and American Imperialism" and "Protect the Lives and Property of Foreigners."</p>

<h3 id="e22">Washington Observation: Peace Treaty with Japan Unlikely to Be Established in the Short Term; No Concrete Expression of Aid to China <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] As the year hurries to an end, the new year brings with it countless international questions, and Japan is becoming increasingly important in American strategic thinking. Inevitably and naturally, China is linked to this thinking. In Washington's view, the future of Japan is intertwined with China. When reviewing the relationship between Japan and Asia at the end of the year, two major questions arise: one is the peace treaty with Japan, and the other is Japan's position and technology in the overall policy. A third question arises from this, namely, the possibility of Japan becoming an obstacle to communism. The results of discussions between United Press and various government departments indicate that the current view in Washington is as follows: a peace treaty with Japan is absolutely impossible to be established in the short term.</p>
<p>The four powers have not yet indicated any change in their positions that would allow the peace treaty to be drafted. The United States originally advocated a two-thirds majority system for passing the draft of the peace treaty, but China and the Soviet Union strongly opposed it, insisting on retaining the power of veto. Reliable sources say that this situation remains the same, and neither side is willing to compromise. Well-informed sources compare the situation in Japan with that in Germany. Both need a peace treaty, but both are unlikely to get a peace treaty while the East-West "Cold War" continues at its current level. They say that, on the contrary, if the tense situation between the Soviet-dominated world and the Western democracies can be improved to some extent, all aspects of the situation can be improved proportionately. If there is hope for a peace treaty with Germany, a peace treaty with Japan can also be achieved easily, and vice versa. Failure in one will lead to failure in both.</p>
<p>The second question is the United States' policy towards China. It is extremely difficult to point to a certain stage in Sino-American relations and say: "Look, this is the policy towards China." When asked to explain the United States' policy towards China, State Department officials advised the questioner to refer to the statements made by Truman, Marshall, and the State Department since 1945, as well as the measures taken by Congress on aid-to-China bills. Whether publicly or privately, officials refuse to make concrete statements. Undersecretary of State Lovett announced at a press conference that U.S. policy remained unchanged, and would continue to be based on the decision of Congress, which recognized the Nationalist government and implemented certain special assistance. Luo repeatedly emphasized to the inquirer that the United States had not changed its policy towards China, but he was unwilling to say more.

<h3 id="e29">Calling on the Netherlands to Ceasefire Immediately <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Netherlands, disregarding the truce agreement, launched a fierce offensive on the 18th of this month against Yogyakarta, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, with its elite troops. This reignited the flames of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, which has lasted for three years, causing indignation among peace-loving people around the world and condemnation from public opinion in various countries. Even the Netherlands' ally, the United States, cannot but denounce the Netherlands' actions in the East Indies as an act of aggression. The United Nations Security Council, meeting in Paris to discuss the Dutch-Indonesian problem, heard representatives of various member states condemn the Netherlands in strong terms. The Soviet representative called for "sanctions" against the Netherlands, and the Australian representative strongly advocated expelling the Netherlands from the United Nations. The Security Council ultimately passed a resolution endorsed by China and the United States, ordering both the Netherlands and Indonesia to cease fire immediately, and decided to include this issue on today's agenda to investigate whether the Netherlands is complying with this ceasefire order.</p>
<p>In today's world, where the United Nations has not yet become an effective institution for maintaining world peace, it is understandable that the Security Council can only make this resolution. However, whether this order can turn hostility into friendship within Indonesia depends on the attitudes of both the Netherlands and Indonesia. According to a United Press report from Batavia on the 25th, the Indonesian Republican government has proposed five conditions for accepting the ceasefire order: (1) Immediate release of Indonesian Republican leaders; (2) Withdrawal of troops to the defense lines before December 18; (3) Recognition, de facto and de jure, of the sovereignty of the Indonesian Republic in the three states of Java, Sumatra, and Madura; (4) Organization of an independent Indonesian state free from Dutch interference; (5) Complete withdrawal of Dutch troops to their home country after the establishment of the new government. From whatever perspective we observe the five conditions put forward by Indonesia, they can generally be considered "reasonable"; moreover, we believe that these five conditions are not only prerequisites for a ceasefire, but also the premise for whether the Dutch-Indonesian conflict can be resolved rationally. Therefore, whether the flames of war in Indonesia can be extinguished immediately depends entirely on the attitude of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Although the Dutch military authorities used the three services of the army, navy, and air force to attack Yogyakarta, the capital of Indonesia, under the pretext of "anti-communism," the Netherlands cannot cover up the truth from the world. The essence of the Indonesian movement is a national liberation movement that demands freedom, equality, and independence, not an international communist revolution. This is known to the world. The Dutch government cannot refuse to accept the Security Council's ceasefire order on the grounds that it "will be exploited by the communists." However, the Netherlands, relying on the superiority of its army, navy, and air force, still holds a colonial attitude towards Indonesia. Having lightly initiated war, it is difficult to expect it to readily accept a ceasefire order afterwards. The Dutch cabinet will hold an emergency meeting to discuss the Security Council's ceasefire order, but it is feared that it will still maintain a stubborn attitude to the end, with no signs of remorse or a willingness to abandon the war and seek peace. Therefore, we cannot but worry about the Indonesian people, and we cannot but express infinite concern for the countless overseas Chinese in our country who will suffer collateral damage.</p>
<p>Putting aside the Dutch-Indonesian problem itself, in terms of its impact on Southeast Asia and even the entire world, if the Netherlands refuses to accept the Security Council's ceasefire order, its consequences will be unimaginable. First, if the Security Council's resolution cannot take effect in the Netherlands, its credibility will be completely lost. Who will be willing to believe that it is an effective institution for maintaining world peace in the future? In order to maintain its credibility, the Security Council will inevitably consider the issue of imposing sanctions on the Netherlands. If it does, the United Nations organization will again encounter an unprecedentedly serious test. Second, looking at the situation in Asia, it is already extremely serious, and the flames of war in Indonesia cannot be allowed to reignite. Everyone knows that today's Asia has hardly any peaceful land left. Northeast Asia is already under the control of the Communist International, China is on the verge of "reddening," and Southeast Asia has also felt the threat of the Communist International. If great international politicians do not start from the aspect of "peace and prosperity" to promote the stability of Southeast Asian countries, then Southeast Asia will inevitably fall into the "iron curtain" sooner or later. Although the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia is under the pretext of "anti-communism," the result of its use of force may be counterproductive, merely making Indonesia more suitable as a hotbed for communism. Therefore, for the sake of the stability of Southeast Asia, and at the same time for the sake of the entire Asia avoiding catastrophe, we must call on the Dutch authorities to immediately accept the Security Council's ceasefire order, and then seek a rational solution to the Dutch-Indonesian problem through peaceful methods and diplomatic channels!</p>

<h3 id="e44">If Dutch Troops Withdraw to Original Positions, Indonesia is Willing to Order a Ceasefire; Mediation Committee Finds Mission Difficult <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 26th] The Indonesian interim government radio announced today that if Dutch troops first withdraw to their pre-offensive positions, Indonesia will respond by ordering a ceasefire. The Dutch troops should also release the detained Indonesian President Sukarno and Prime Minister Hatta. According to Indonesian sources, the interim government is located on the island of Giroepo, and had been entrusted by Prime Minister Hatta.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Batavia, 26th] The UN Mediation Committee cabled the Security Council on the 26th stating: "Although the Security Council has ordered the Mediation Committee to monitor military actions in Indonesia, in reality this is extremely impossible. The cable pointed out that the demarcation line no longer exists, and the Mediation Committee is unable to accurately distinguish between Dutch-Indonesian military actions and Dutch security measures." The cable stated: "The Committee will do its best to execute the powers granted to it..., but if negotiations replace warfare, the Committee unanimously recognizes that certain unavoidable difficulties must first be overcome..., the members of the Committee only slightly disagree on the weight of the aforementioned difficulties.... In fact, at a time when the demarcation line no longer exists, the position of the Indonesian Republican Army is truly impossible to determine, as the Dutch troops have captured the Indonesian supreme command. Therefore, the Committee may have to pay attention to any military actions throughout the three islands of Java, Sumatra, and Madura. This in itself makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between Dutch security measures and the war between the Dutch and Indonesians." The cable also accused the Dutch of violating Article 10 of the ceasefire agreement, as the Dutch declaration of war was delivered to the American Commissioner in Batavia, and not directly to the Chairman of the Mediation Committee stationed in Kaliurang. It also stated: "At that time, the Chairman of the Committee had been notified and knew that 'Dutch troops had been operating in the Republic for more than three days after crossing the status quo line.'" The Mediation Committee also accused the Netherlands of not notifying the Republic of military actions in accordance with the ceasefire agreement. The cable pointed out that "the notice delivered to the Secretary-General of the Republic's delegation was not in the form of a note as stipulated in Article 10, especially since the Dutch government had cut off communication with the Republic, and therefore the content of the Dutch letter could not possibly be made known to the government of the Republic. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary-General himself was arrested..." The Mediation Committee's cable concluded: "While the ceasefire agreement was still fully in effect, the Dutch government did not provide effective notification when abolishing the agreement, and Dutch troops immediately crossed the status quo line and launched hostile military actions against the Indonesian Republic."</p>
<h3 id="e45">Dutch Disregard UN Ceasefire Order, Announce Occupation of Madiun, Thus Dutch Control All Major Cities in Java <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 25th] Dutch troops today disregarded the UN ceasefire order and occupied Madiun, the last major city of the Indonesian Republic, and now control almost all of Java. Most of Sumatra has also fallen into Dutch hands. Indonesian troops have retreated into the mountains.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Batavia, 25th] The Dutch military headquarters announced on the 25th that it had occupied Madiun. Madiun is the location where the Indonesian Communist Party uprising occurred twelve days in September, located about 335 miles east of Batavia, and is an important intersection of highways and railways in Central Java. Since occupying Madiun, the Netherlands now possesses all the major cities and highways throughout Java. The Dutch military headquarters also announced that the Dutch troops have begun large-scale mopping-up operations in the entire area occupied in the past week, which indicates that the Java war has now become a war between the Dutch troops and mobile guerrillas.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Batavia, 25th] The only area currently fully controlled by the Republican Army is the Madiun area of East Java. Since the Dutch launched a full-scale offensive, the Republican Army in Madiun has cooperated with the Communist forces to offer strong resistance to the Dutch troops. The commander-in-chief of the allied forces is Tayamuraka, who gave a broadcast speech on December 21st, emphasizing resistance to the end. On the other hand, it is highly doubtful whether the Dutch are willing to obey the Security Council's ceasefire order before they have fully achieved their goals, that is, completely eliminating the Indonesian army.</p>

<p>Related to Political Organizations in the State</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New Delhi, 25th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru and the Nizam of Hyderabad held their first courtesy visit to each other in Hyderabad. The Nizam of Hyderabad visiting the Indian Prime Minister at the former British official residence broke a century-old custom of Hyderabad, and Nehru paying with a coin when the Nizam agreed to meet was also an exception. It is customary for distinguished guests visiting the Nizam of Hyderabad to make a donation. It is widely believed that Nehru's visit to Hyderabad is related to the political organizations in the state. The Socialist Party in the state will submit a memorandum to Nehru, signed by 4,000 comrades, demanding the immediate abolition of the Nizam. The Congress Party in Hyderabad wants to organize an interim government as soon as possible to replace the military government in the state.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New Delhi, 26th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru addressed 500,000 people from the grandstand of the Hyderabad Fanteh Grand Square on the 25th, stating: Hyderabad should end its current military rule and establish an interim government, with all power in the hands of the people themselves, and the people should realize this responsibility. In reviewing the situation in India, Nehru attacked the Communist Party for constantly making arrogant and provocative statements to the people, inciting them to take the path of riots and revolution.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 26th] The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today denying the Israeli government's accusation that the Egyptian government had taken free action in the Negev after refusing the Security Council's resolution and being unwilling to sign a permanent truce agreement.</p>
<p>The Egyptian statement strongly stated that Egypt had already announced its acceptance of the Security Council's resolutions of November 16th and December 4th, but the counter-proposal put forward by Egypt was that the Jewish forces must also comply with the provisions of the two resolutions. The statement concluded by requesting the Security Council to immediately convene a meeting to review the new situation arising from the Jewish aggression.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Cairo, 25th] The Egyptian Minister of Military Affairs stated today that fighting in the Negev desert area is continuing, and Egyptian forces shot down an Israeli aircraft with anti-aircraft guns.

<p>[Associated Press Vice President Vaughn, Tokyo, 26th] The report that Commonwealth leaders are considering holding an "Eastern Conference" to plan for the united resistance of Asian democratic countries against the aggression of the Communist Party and Soviet totalitarianism has been received here with great interest. Allied leaders in Tokyo have long discussed the need for such a meeting informally, and some Americans undoubtedly agree with this proposal and believe that the United States should also participate. They pointed out that Washington has a moral obligation to defend Japan and the Philippines and is extremely concerned about both countries. If such a conference is to be held, and the United States and the Philippines participate, Manila may be suggested as a suitable location. If such a conference is purely held by the countries belonging to the Commonwealth, then Singapore or Kuala Lumpur may be chosen. Due to the competition between India and Pakistan, the meeting will not be held in New Delhi or Karachi. Senior observers here do not believe that China will be completely communist, and that any assistance given to the Chinese government will trigger a crisis of war with the Soviet Union. These observers are confident that the Soviet Union is determined not to risk war in Asia at this time. They insist that the Soviet Union is clearly not prepared to fight in Asia.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Washington, 25th] Although major powers have disputes over other international issues, the drafting of the proposed seven-nation North Atlantic Security Treaty is proceeding rapidly. If all goes smoothly, it could be submitted to the US Senate for review within six weeks. The diplomats responsible for drafting have temporarily suspended work due to the Christmas holidays. As the meeting moves towards a final agreement, the proceedings are being kept even more secret. However, according to diplomatic sources familiar with the matter, the negotiations are proceeding very smoothly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 25th] Semi-official newspapers here, which can reflect the views of the Turkish government, have recently strongly argued that Turkey should be allowed to participate in the Atlantic Treaty. Currently, there is a consensus in Turkey that if the Soviet Union knows that Turkey will participate in the war, even if it is not directly attacked, it must closely unite with other countries, then the Soviet Union will not dare to launch a war rashly.</p>

They pointed out that the Yugoslav delegation's negotiations in Moscow have not made any progress so far, so the new British-Yugoslav agreement is all the more important.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Our country's Muslim pilgrimage group, a party of two hundred, embarked from Shanghai in mid-October of this year and arrived in Mecca, the holy land of Islam in early October. After holding a grand pilgrimage ceremony on "Loyalty and Filial Piety Day," they took the "Hunan" cargo ship to return home and are expected to arrive in port this morning. The Chinese Islamic Association has sent Director Ding Zhenting and Acting Director Jin Hongkui to Shanghai to jointly handle the reception matters with the local Muslims. According to the Association, this year a total of 350,000 Muslims from various countries participated in the pilgrimage, which was an unprecedentedly grand occasion. Pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of Islam.

<p>[Our Reporter] After the Bureau of Materials Supply completed the distribution of accumulation points for October, there has been no news about the distribution of accumulation points for November. Public education personnel are all concerned about this. According to Director Jiang of the bureau, he told reporters yesterday: The distribution of accumulation points for November could have followed October, but the Ministry of National Defense needs to allocate a large batch of materials from the bureau for the supply of materials to the soldiers at the front, so it is currently checking how many materials are still in the bureau. After the Ministry of National Defense extracts the materials it needs, the remaining materials can be distributed proportionally to the public education institutions with special November accumulation point certificates. It is expected that the distribution of accumulation points for November will be decided before Wednesday of this week. As for the rumors that the bureau currently only has mirrors, peach wood medicines, and glasses, this is not true. However, since most of them are materials that have been selected and left over, it cannot be guaranteed that everything will be practical, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Building a New China is Everyone's Responsibility <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting opened, Song Mingshi, Chairman of the Technology Association, reported on the association's affairs, saying: The second annual meeting of the Technology Association and the industrial technology exhibition are being held here at the end of the year, which is a major review of the work of all members. In the two or three years after the victory, members in various places have been working hard at their posts for China's construction cause. Although the environment is difficult, talented young technicians should shoulder the heavy responsibility of building a new China, and it is their unshirkable responsibility. In the future, they should strengthen unity and mutual assistance, and step up learning, so that the spirit of overcoming obstacles can be implemented in daily life and work, so that the entire construction cause can be completed and developed in hardship, and the country can stand firm in the wind and rain. Then Zhao Zukang delivered a speech, saying that the complete realization of China's Three People's Principles depends on the success of the implementation of three tasks, namely, nationalism depends on health, democracy depends on education, and people's livelihood depends on construction. At present, China's health care, education, and construction work have not reached the ideal level, so he hopes that all members of the Technology Association should promote the construction movement from urban areas to rural areas, hospitals, schools, and factories in the future, so that the Three People's Principles can establish a foundation through the efforts of the Technology Association.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Backward Production is the Source of War <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Then Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, delivered a speech, emphasizing that technical talents should have the cohesive force of "cement." Zhao also put forward three points to indicate the direction that technical talents should follow. He said: First, "Backward production is the source of war": China has been in deep water for the past fifty years, and has been seeking freedom and equality, but in reality, it has always been unattainable. The main reason is that production is backward and there is a lack of technology. The lack of technology leads to backward production, which is a vicious cycle. If we only look at the technical point of view, the reason why production is backward and there is a lack of technology is that the general public has not recognized the importance of technology, and the technical personnel themselves have not recognized their responsibility to the country. In today's era of artillery fire, talking about using technology to save the country is certainly not empty talk to solve national problems, but it should be recognized from now on that it is important to develop production and develop technology. Implement it resolutely, because the current war will inevitably stop one day. In the past, because production was backward, there is today's war. If we want to ensure that there will be no more wars in the future, we should develop production and develop technology.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Unity to Realize the People's Livelihood Plan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Second, "Technical personnel should strengthen unity and realize the people's livelihood plan": If China is to develop production, all technical personnel must unite and carry it out with collective strength. From our own experience and the experience of others, we have realized that we can only use the method of "planned economy" to develop production and solve the people's livelihood, which is the most effective way to quickly achieve results. This is the so-called "catching up" method. Therefore, in order to cooperate with solving the people's livelihood through a "planned economy," we technicians should unite under one goal to make that "plan" come true. In other words, let us promote that "plan." What our country lacks is unity in national interests and national interests. Most technical personnel still retain the traditional concept of "taking care of themselves" and cannot practice "unity." We must correct this shortcoming in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Striving for Technology, Freedom, and Equality <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Third, "Use technology to strive for freedom and equality": The meaning of technology is "utilizing resources for the betterment of life." Here, "life" refers to "people's livelihood," and also "human life," its connotation being extremely broad. In other words, technology should serve all of humanity; this is its highest goal. However, in its development process, it should start from one's own country. Because the purpose of technology is for "people's livelihood" and not for war, it can then be extended from one's own country to the world, which is the world of Great Harmony. The world of Great Harmony is "everyone contributes their best, everyone takes what they need." The former is "giving," and the latter is "taking," and they should be mutually treated. If we only "take" without "giving," it indicates that we are not yet independent and can only be others' "vassals," and the world of Great Harmony will never be reached.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Post-Meeting Technical Symposium <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In addition, guests such as Zeng Shirong, Wang Zhizhuo, and He Shangping also delivered speeches. He Shangping called on the government to grant farmers the rights of heaven, land, and people, to protect them from disasters and all artificial exploitation, so that agricultural production can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>The annual meeting concluded at noon, and all members immediately began discussing association affairs and held a luncheon. In the afternoon, a technical experience symposium was held, and those in charge of technology from major factories in the city attended. Today is the second day of the association's annual meeting. All members will be divided into groups to visit major industrial institutions in the city. Tomorrow afternoon, the Industrial Technology Exhibition will still be pre-exhibited at Jiaotong University. All exhibits have been properly arranged, and the content is extremely rich.

<h3 id="e70">Difficulty in Conscription of Laborers, Decided to Adopt a Hiring Method for Compulsory Labor Service <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>In order to complete local construction projects in the coming year, the city is preparing to implement compulsory labor. The original plan was to conscript eligible laborers between the ages of ten and forty-five in accordance with central government regulations. It is now learned that the municipal authorities and local public opinion organs have carefully studied the matter and believe that the method of conscripting laborers for compulsory labor may provoke public reaction in the current turbulent situation. It has now been decided to adopt a hiring method, and temporary workers will be recruited in the suburban areas, with each person receiving remuneration, tentatively set at four yuan per work unit. The fundraising for this expenditure will be the responsibility of the Engineering Committee, and the city's districts and neighborhoods will be assisted in soliciting donations from eligible laborers. A reporter from the East China News Agency learned that the hiring method for compulsory labor is not only easier than rigid conscription, but also may achieve the expected plan in terms of engineering technology, because for general projects, if unskilled laborers are used, the actual progress will inevitably encounter many difficulties.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The new method for depositing and exchanging gold and silver is still under careful study by the central authorities and may be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval within a week. Major banks and bureaus in the city have submitted a large amount of information to the Ministry of Finance for reference. In addition, the Central Bank is currently compiling statistics on the exact amount of gold and silver sold nationwide since the handling of deposit and exchange business, and it will be officially announced within days. According to related sources, the amount exchanged accounts for only one-twentieth of the inventory, so the reserves are extremely abundant, and under a planned and restricted deposit and exchange method, there is no fear of scarcity.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Scalpers Exchange Gold for Profit, Apply for Reissuance of ID Cards, Civil Affairs Bureau Decides to Strictly Review <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the Civil Affairs Bureau: The Central Bank is handling the deposit and exchange of gold and silver. In order to prevent scalpers from squeezing for profit, those who exchange must hold a national identity card, and after the exchange, the identity card will be stamped for identification. The bureau recently received reports that district offices in various districts have been applying for new identity cards in large numbers recently. The reason is speculated to be that most scalpers reported the loss and reapplied for the original national identity cards that had been stamped with "Exchanged Gold and Silver," or destroyed and re-applied for new identity cards. The bureau has specifically ordered district offices that in the future, the issuance of new national identity cards must be reviewed by Director Zhang himself, in order to stop abuses.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Culprit Apprehended Based on Footprints, Worker from China Textile Factory No. 27, Chopped Colleague with Knife in Late-Night Robbery <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At approximately 10:30 PM on the 25th, Song Zhetang, a farmer in the vegetable garden near the Wengjiazhai manure factory on Guiyang Road, Hejian Road, in Pudong, suddenly heard cries for help from the vegetable field to the east. He rushed out to inspect and found a man lying on the vegetable field, with three knife wounds to his head, appearing very serious. He reported the situation to the Yangshupu Police Sub-bureau, who urgently summoned an ambulance to send the victim to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. After investigation, it was learned that the victim was named Song Jingnian, 33 years old, from Liyang, and a worker at China Textile Factory No. 17, residing in a shanty in Wengjiazhai, Hejian Road, with no number. His wife was summoned to the bureau for questioning, and she revealed that her husband, Song Jingnian, had 2,000 yuan in new Central Bank serial-numbered ten-yuan banknotes and had been robbed. The sub-bureau chief Wang ordered section chief Ji Bingquan to supervise officers Ni Zhihong, police officers Yang Liangdong, Shi Borong, Li Xumin, and Zhang Shaoying to rush to the scene for investigation and found an axe used in the attack. Based on the footprints left behind, they tracked and arrested a suspicious pedestrian at Pingliang Road and Linqing Road. They were intercepted by patrol officers No. 4088, 1071, and 2160 from the sub-bureau. The man's speech was hesitant, and his behavior was flustered, so he was taken to the bureau for interrogation. He claimed to be Qu Hongxi, 26 years old, from Yangzhou, a worker at China Textile Factory No. 17, residing at No. 259, Lane 14, Tongxing Workshop, Zhoujiapai Road. However, he flatly denied the attack on Song Jingnian and the robbery of the new banknotes. After comparing the footprints left behind, they matched perfectly, and 2,000 yuan in gold yuan, all in serial-numbered new banknotes, were found on his person, at which point he confessed. According to his confession: He and the victim were originally colleagues at the same factory. In July of this year, I gradually owed Song one stone and five dou of rice, and he often asked me for it, so I harbored resentment. This morning, Song received a wage bonus of 2,000 yuan at the factory, and I deceived him into going to the Bund Central Bank to exchange it for gold, but unexpectedly, the exchange had been suspended. We spent the whole day together, and when we returned at around 10 PM, when passing through the vegetable field of the manure factory, I took out the hidden axe while he was unprepared and struck his head three times. He immediately fell, and I thought he was dead, so I took all 2,000 yuan from his pocket. The sub-bureau reported the case to the General Bureau to send the suspect and the stolen goods to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>

<p>Hong Runxiang, 51 years old, from Anhui, a commissioner stationed in Taiwan by the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications Shuyu Enterprise Company to purchase salt, is being sued for abandonment by his wife, Hong Wang Linna, with the court, because he is infatuated with Gao Meixiu, a Japanese waitress at the Shanglinhua Restaurant in Taipei, Taiwan. The plaintiff is requesting the court to notify the Taiwan Provincial Court and order the arrest and bail of Hong for trial. According to Wang's complaint, "When I married Hong in Changsha twelve years ago, Hong was still penniless and taught at Changsha No. 1 High School. After the victory, Runxiang was appointed as the commissioner stationed in Taiwan by the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications Shuyu Enterprise Company to purchase salt. In less than half a year, he became extremely wealthy and became infatuated with Gao Meixiu, a waitress at the Shanglinhua Restaurant in Taipei, and cohabited with her on the third floor of the Tianxing Pharmacy at No. 118, Taipingmachi, Taipei, acting like husband and wife. He not only disregarded his wife, but also constantly sent letters to provoke her. In July of this year, Runxiang returned to Shanghai from Taiwan with Gao Meixiu and forcibly moved into the house at No. 70, Yonglefang, Sichuan Road, forcibly occupying it. Linna negotiated with him, but was scolded and beaten by him. The China Relief Society for Women and Children mediated and stipulated that the five rooms of the above-mentioned house and the furniture should be used and disposed of freely by Linna, and Runxiang would permanently end his relationship with Gao Meixiu. Unexpectedly, after only a few days, he cohabited with her in Taipei again, and did not care about the family at all. His daughter, Wang Lili, is 17 years old and suffers from severe lung disease. She has no money for medical treatment and mourns her father, while Runxiang is far away in Taipei, hiding beauties in his house, leading a life of extravagance."</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the academic calendar stipulated by the Ministry of Education, the city's elementary and middle schools must end at the end of January next year. Regarding the rumor that the municipal middle schools have decided to start the vacation one week earlier, Education Bureau Director Li Ximou told reporters that this is not true. The Education Bureau has not yet made any decision on this matter. Although it was discussed at the bureau's meeting last week, no conclusion was reached. When asked of Mayor Wu, the mayor also made no decision. Director Li believes that according to the closing date stipulated by the Ministry of Education, it must be before the Lunar New Year.

However, at this time and in this place, all measures should be taken with caution to avoid affecting people's hearts. Therefore, regarding whether or not to end this semester early, he will seek the opinion of the Ministry of Education in a private capacity before making a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Failure to Repair After Being Damaged Will Eventually Lead to Trouble, Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries School Alumni Association and Others Report on the Fishery Kang Ship Accident <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the Fishery Kang (formerly known as the Connaught Irongen) ship of the Fisheries Administration was lost, the families of the sailors repeatedly asked the Fisheries Administration to handle various aftermath matters as soon as possible and investigate the issue of responsibility, but there has been no concrete solution. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries School Alumni Association and representatives of the families of the victims hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city, reporting on the events before and after the accident and appealing to the public for support. Briefly stated: The ship sailed out of Shenjiamen on October 15, led by acting captain Que Zhaoyuan, and collided with the Fishery Xin ship, causing damage and leakage in the bow. After slight repairs, acting captain Que inspected on the 21st and found that there was still leakage and telegraphed the chief captain's office to request a return to port for major repairs, but it was not approved, so it continued to fish. Afterwards, Captain Wang Jingsheng of the ship requested repairs again, but was still not approved. On the 2nd of this month, he was ordered to reluctantly go out to fish. Before the trip, Captain Wang expressed his dissatisfaction to his superiors for not allowing repairs and ordering the damaged ship to go out to sea to fish, disregarding the safety of the fishermen. He said that he would resign after this return trip.</p>
<p>Unable to Withstand the Waves, Three Telegraphs for Help</p>
<p>The ship then sailed out of Shanghai on the 11th of this month. On the 13th at 6:30 PM, the Meteorological Observatory of the Fisheries Administration routinely reported weather forecasts that the wind force was 10-8 knots, which is a very common wind force at sea. On the morning of the 14th, the wind force was slightly stronger, and the waves were also gradually higher. Captain Wang warned the captains of the Fishery Hui and Fishery Su ships, which were operating in the same area, by telephone that the climate was deteriorating, the wind and waves were gradually increasing, and they should be prepared, hoping to pull up the nets and avoid the wind. He said, "Please go first, and I will go one hour later." This proves that Captain Wang had abundant experience. At about 9 o'clock, when the net was pulled up, the scars on the bow could not withstand the waves, and cracks leaked water. He then issued three emergency calls for help at 10 o'clock, 11:15, and 11:40, but the radio station of the Fisheries Administration did not receive any of them once. At 2 PM, the Fishery Jin ship, which was operating in the Northern Ocean, reported to the Qingdao branch of the Fisheries Administration that the Shanghai Fishery Kang ship had encountered an accident and had called for help. Only then did the Fuxing Island Radio Station of the Fisheries Administration accidentally hear it. At this time, the chief captain was temporarily at a loss. One mistake led to another, and the ship was finally lost and sunk.</p>
<p>Calmly Changed Clothes Awaiting Death, Proving a Slow Sinking</p>
<p>According to the Fishery Kang ship's last call for help at 11:40, by 5 PM, the old sailor Qi Aying, who was on a sailboat in the same sea area, saw that it had not completely sunk, and the crew members were all gathered on the deck of the wheelhouse waiting for rescue, which proves that the sinking speed was slow. And from the observation of the body of the sailor Jiang Axiang, who was salvaged, the outer and inner clothes he was wearing were all newly changed, and he was wearing new leather shoes, all of which were not the clothes worn during operation, which proves that at the time of the accident, he had tried his best to save himself. Until the final despair, he calmly changed into new clothes and waited for the arrival of death. This fact is also clear evidence of the slow sinking, but the Fisheries Administration only notified the fishing boats on the sea to rescue on the morning of the 15th. It is said that they entrusted the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Taiwan flight to assist in the search by plane. According to the company, a sunken ship was found at 122 degrees 45 minutes east longitude and 28 degrees 45 minutes north latitude, and it was said that there were two white lights at the bow and stern. However, since it was said to be a sunken ship, how could there be white lights? Obviously, the news was inaccurate, and the chief and deputy captains Liu Jinghan and others mistakenly regarded it as good news, thinking that the ship could escape the danger, one mistake after another. By the 16th, not only was rescue hopeless, but also the bodies could not be salvaged. The representatives also commented that the creation of this unfortunate incident was extremely related to the unsound personnel of the Fisheries Administration. The radio station staff of the chief captain's office should be held responsible.</p>
<p>List of Deceased Crew Members</p>
<p>Attached is a list of the deceased crew members: Captain Wang Jingsheng; Chief Mate Zhu Zijun; Fisheries Officer Gao Tongde; Chief Engineer Wang Hang; Second Officer Xin Yebao?; Fisherman Leader Jiang Guoliang; Fishermen Jiang Axiang, Jiang Rusheng, Lang Xuecheng, Shen Laiche, Wu Kunxing; Intern Shi (a graduate of Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School who boarded the ship for internship).</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses for various industries this year, the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives from labor and management to form a year-end bonus handling committee to be responsible for mediation. According to the person in charge of the committee, although the industrial and commercial sectors are in a state of recession this year, both labor and management have a spirit of mutual understanding on the issue of year-end bonus distribution. Not as many factories in various industries have applied to the handling committee for mediation as in the previous year. For example, industries such as cotton textiles and department stores have reached a solution after mediation by the committee. As for those still under mediation, the committee is persuading both labor and management to accept based on the established laws and regulations, in order to seek a fair resolution. Some industries are still discussing the distribution method independently. There have been no strikes or work slowdowns due to year-end bonus disputes. This is a manifestation of workers' compliance with government laws and regulations. It is predicted that the year-end bonus disputes in various industries this year will not be difficult to resolve satisfactorily.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, the No. 10 public bus from a certain number on Changning Road, West Shanghai, near the gate of Zhongshan Park, was about to depart when a platoon leader-ranked officer arrived with two soldiers. They insisted on boarding the bus by forcing the door open but were refused. They then assaulted the ticket seller, number 947. Shortly after, more and more public buses gathered at the scene, and drivers and ticket sellers congregated. The offending soldiers then left westward together. Soon after, the soldiers returned with thirty or forty companions. Without asking questions, they took Li Yonghui, the ticket inspector number 61 on the side of the road, to their company headquarters. Drivers and ticket sellers were enraged and reported the incident to the French Concession Police Sub-Bureau. Bureau Chief Shao then ordered Section Member Zhu Yuanzhang to lead police officers to the company headquarters to mediate. He also reported the incident to the Investigation Team of the Garrison Command's Third Division. Division Chief Yan Jinwen personally went to the company headquarters to investigate the truth of the incident. The assaulting soldiers were taken back to the division for questioning and then released to the company for disciplinary action according to regulations. Normal public bus service was not restored until after 8 PM.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] A mixture of wind and rain has hit Japan, bringing severe cold. According to the weather bureau's prediction, it may snow today because a Siberian cold front is currently enveloping the entire country, while a Pacific low-pressure system has swept across the Sea of Japan and is moving northwest. The two major air currents are meeting downstream of the Yangtze River. As a result, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places had heavy snowfall yesterday. The climate in this city is unlikely to improve in the next day or two.

<h3 id="e94">The Mystery of the Grain-for-Cash Conversion in Jiaxing <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Chen Jianxiong</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Jiaxing on the 23rd] Recently, a mysterious case of land tax conversion to currency occurred in Jiaxing. Although the people petitioned the assembly, and assembly members sent letters to the speaker and deputy speaker requesting the grain administration authorities to make a public announcement, the issue has been developing for more than two months. However, the grain administration authorities have consistently adopted an "ignore and don't ask" attitude, delaying clarification. Their stance has caused widespread surprise and suspicion among various sectors of society.</p>
<p>Rice Grain Sprouts an Inch Long</p>
<p>Just as the early rice harvest season was approaching in the autumn, the weather turned unfavorable, with continuous wind and rain. The river water flooded the rice paddies, making it impossible to drain the water in time. As a result, the fully ripened ears of rice fell over, and the grains sprouted an inch long after being soaked in water. Farmers in the early rice-growing areas were immediately alarmed and petitioned the county government. In addition to providing comfort and conducting investigations, the authorities were deeply concerned about the assessment ratio for the new tax collection. According to the investigation results, 127,000 mu of rice paddies (in the early rice-growing areas) were affected by the flood, resulting in a reduction of 180,400 dan in harvest. (Note: The total area of paddy fields in the county is 1,094,744 mu, with an average yield of four dan per mu, totaling 4,377,598,876 dan).</p>
<p>Paying Taxes in Currency Brings Joy</p>
<p>Since the townships in the early rice-growing areas suffered such a severe disaster, and the "sprouted grain" did not meet the standards for tax grain stipulated by the ministry, farmers were unable to pay land taxes because they simply had no grain. Therefore, the county's Land and Grain Bureau was ordered to begin collecting new taxes in the early rice-growing areas on September 1st, which was effectively hindered. In order to find a remedy and accept the opinions of local people, the county's grain administration authorities requested approval from the provincial government to allow tax payment in legal currency. The provincial government, in consideration of the difficulties faced by farmers, approved the request, but stipulated that the amount of currency conversion should not exceed 30,000 shi, with each shi converted at a price of 8.1 yuan in gold yuan. Although local people at the time believed that the conversion price was too high and requested a reduction, they did not strongly advocate for it, perhaps fearing being seen as "taking an inch and wanting a mile." In this way, both the grain administration officials and the farmers were delighted.</p>
<p>Distributing According to Tax Quotas</p>
<p>At that time, the county's Land and Grain Bureau allocated the 30,000 dan of tax grain converted to currency proportionally according to the tax quotas borne by each township in the early rice-growing areas: Fengqiao 12,500 shi, Qihuang 8,000 shi, Zhudian 4,800 shi, Buyun 2,500 shi, and Chengdong 2,200 shi. Because the collection period coincided with the "August 19th" price controls in mid-October, the price of rice at that time was only 16.67 yuan in gold yuan per shi, which was not far from the conversion price of 8.1 yuan per shi of paddy rice. (However, the black market price of coarse grain had already exceeded 20 yuan.) Therefore, paying land taxes with paddy rice at 8.1 yuan per shi was indeed considered a good deal. According to reports from various receiving warehouses, taxpayers were very enthusiastic, and the quotas for each township were quickly filled within a few days.</p>
<p>Rumors Accuse Scalpers of Manipulation</p>
<p>That's where the problem started. Rumors arose from various sources, making numerous accusations, such as claims that the receiving warehouses were being "manipulated by scalpers." Some wondered "with the current personnel in each receiving warehouse, how could they collect the full amount in just three days?" In fact, these rumors could have been immediately dispelled if each receiving warehouse had simply publicly posted the list of grain households who paid the tax. However, the grain administration authorities did not do so, remaining "silent and feigning ignorance," without making any statements. This further fueled suspicions from all sides.</p>
<p>Grain Administration Authorities Make No Response</p>
<p>Behind the rumors, actions began to take place. On November 19th, a petition to the assembly from "an ordinary citizen who is not afraid of trouble" appeared in two local major newspapers. The petition was lengthy and completely accused the many malpractices of this conversion. Finally, it suggested three points: (1) The grain administration authorities should promptly announce the list of grain households who paid taxes in currency. (2) The amount of money and the number of mu should be written under the name of the household. (3) Investigate and correct the illegal behavior of the tax collectors. Subsequently, on December 13th, a public letter from Assembly Member Zheng Songling to the speaker and deputy speaker was published, stating: "...It is heard that the collection of land taxes in currency by the Land and Grain Offices in the early rice-growing areas was very short, and it was immediately declared that the quota was full, resulting in many rumors from outside. It is said that the actual number of stones collected in this currency conversion was only over 12,000 shi. The number that was claimed as full appears to have been fraudulent. It is not known whether this rumor is true or false, but for the sake of smooth tax collection, it is proposed to suggest that the county's Land and Grain Bureau order the Land and Grain Offices in each early rice-growing area to promptly announce the names of each grain household that paid taxes in currency and the actual number of stones collected, in order to show great credibility."</p>
<p>However, the grain administration authorities have consistently maintained an attitude of "turning a deaf ear" in the past, ignoring the situation. Now, the new person has taken over the job, and the personnel of the Land and Grain Bureau may be changed in the future. When will this "mystery case" that has been put on hold be revealed? This is truly something that all sectors are "eagerly awaiting!"</p>
<h3 id="e95">Guizhou Province Implements New Methods for Planting Tung Trees <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Guiyang on the 21st] China has a very long history of planting tung trees. As early as the Tang Dynasty, the "Supplement to the Materia Medica" recorded: "The yingzi grows in the mountains, and the tree is similar to the wu." The so-called yingzi is a type of tung tree. By the Song and Ming Dynasties, cultivation became more widespread. Chen Jian of the Song Dynasty wrote a book called "Tung Tree Manual," which consists of ten chapters, pioneering the study of tung tree cultivation. In the Ming Dynasty, Hongwu ordered the planting of tung, lacquer, and palm trees on the sunny side of the Hammer Mountain in Nanjing, covering 500,000 mu. This shows that the rulers already knew its importance and promoted it.</p>
<p>Tung trees belong to the Euphorbiaceae family and the Vernicia genus. They are deciduous trees with many varieties. The Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has selected more than 500 varieties. The tung oil extracted from tung fruits is also complex, generally divided into four types: tung oil, light oil, hong oil, and xiu oil. Among them, tung oil is further divided by color. White tung oil produced in eastern Sichuan, western Hunan, and northeastern Guizhou is the most famous for its excellent quality, mostly sold abroad. Its export value holds a high position in China's total commodity export value, remaining strong since the victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Hilly Areas Are Most Suitable for Planting Tung Trees</p>
<p>Tung trees are economic crops of hilly areas and are not found in vast plains. Their altitude is limited to 2,000 meters above sea level, and the minimum altitude must be above 200 meters. In eastern Sichuan, the most common altitude is between 250 and 1,500 meters. In western Hunan and northeastern Guizhou, the altitude is between 400 and 1,500 meters. Therefore, the terrain, soil, and temperature of this triangular area are more suitable for the growth and abundant fruiting of tung trees than any other region in the country.</p>
<p>Wujiang River Basin Is the Tung Oil Production Center</p>
<p>In Guizhou, tung trees are distributed throughout the province. According to the survey and research conducted by the Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the area of tung tree cultivation in Guizhou Province in 1947 was approximately 400,000 mu, and the tung oil harvest was more than 256,000 dan. The eleven counties in the Wujiang River Basin, such as Xiuwen, Yanhe, and Sinan; the eight counties in the Jinjiang and Qingshui River Basins, such as Tongren, Zhenyuan, and Jinping; the seven counties in the Yunwu Mountain area, such as Guiding, Duyun, and Luodian; the seven counties in the Beipan River Basin, such as Zhenfeng, Guanling, and Ceheng; and the two counties in the Chishui River Basin, such as Renhuai and Chishui, are all well-known tung-producing areas. Among them, the Wujiang River Basin area is the most important, and it is the center of tung oil production in Guizhou. The distribution markets of tung oil in Guizhou are also mainly concentrated in this area, which transports the tung oil north to Chongqing, east to Changde, or south to Wuzhou for export year-round, benefiting the rural economy. This is even more significant than the booming American tobacco cultivation industry in recent years.</p>
<p>Assisting the Province in Investigation and Research</p>
<p>Chairman Gu Zhenglun was concerned that the people of the province relied on the supply of cotton yarn from Hunan for their needs. At the beginning of his administration, he made increasing the production of tung oil and rapeseed oil, the province's specialty products, the primary goal of production and construction. Within three years, he set the ambitious goal of planting 50,000 tung trees throughout the province. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had previously established a Tung Tea Experimental Farm in Meitan County, northeastern Guizhou, in 1940 to experiment with new planting methods, which proved to be effective. In order to cooperate with the provincial and local authorities' decision to increase the planting of tung trees and produce tung oil, the ministry specially dispatched Inspector Deng Zhaohua to Guizhou to assist in the investigation and research, with the hope of achieving the goal ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>New Methods of Cultivation Achieve Remarkable Success</p>
<p>According to Zhu Yuanlin, the director of the Meitan Tung Tea Experimental Farm, and Deng Zhaohua, the farm has been conducting diligent research for the past nine years and has achieved remarkable success in implementing the selection and breeding of superior varieties and experimenting with new cultivation techniques in the Wujiang River Basin. In terms of varieties, the successful ones include Zhongnong No. 33, a two-year tung tree, and Zhongnong No. 10, a three-year tung tree. The two-year tung tree can begin to bear fruit in the second year after planting and reaches its peak in the third, fourth, and fifth years, with a lifespan of at least 15 years. The three-year tung tree begins to bear fruit in the third year after planting and reaches its peak in the fifth, sixth, and seventh years, with a lifespan of up to 30 years. These two types of tung trees have been cultivated in Meitan County for nine years and have grown very well, with no diseases. They are very popular among the people in the local and nearby tung-producing counties. Some tung farmers in eastern Sichuan and western Hunan even travel hundreds of miles to steal tung seeds and seedlings. In terms of cultivation techniques, new methods such as budding and grafting can be used to advance the fruiting time and increase the yield and oil content of tung fruit. The farm is also continuously experimenting and researching other related technologies.</p>
<p>Mechanical Oil Extraction Improves Oil Quality</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to launch a campaign to increase the production of tung trees and tung oil throughout Guizhou Province next year. The provincial government's newly established Materials Production and Marketing Company also aims to develop the province's tung oil export business as one of its three major foreign trade objectives. Regarding the new-style pressing and processing equipment for tung oil, plans are currently underway to establish a factory in Zunyi County, near Meitan, to use mechanical oil extraction to eliminate the old-style wooden presses, thereby increasing efficiency and improving oil quality. It is reported that the Director of the Construction Department, He, went to Guangzhou to discuss this matter with the Guangdong provincial authorities five weeks ago, and this was also one of his tasks.</p>

<p>— Our Special Correspondent Yushan</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Guilin on the 20th] It is now midwinter, with continuous rain and mist. Looking at the muddy roads with mud splashing in the south and north of the city, it is heart-wrenching to see groups of travelers on the road.</p>
<p>Gusts of north wind blow in the southward-bound geese that were forced away by the cold wave. Every day, the Xiang-Gui Road has added a few more carriages of southbound travelers. Many fashionable honored guests from thousands of miles away in the north and south of the Yangtze River have suddenly appeared on the quiet streets. In their eyes, Guilin is much less attractive than in previous years, with its uncoordinated old and new houses, rotten roads like those with smallpox scars, and unreliable electric lights.</p>
<p>Even so, there are still places here that they long for. No matter the weather, they visit the Seven Star Cave, Wind Cave, Dragon Hidden, Crescent Moon, and Putuo in groups every day. Although prices here are already causing people to complain, they seem extremely cheap to them. In tea houses, restaurants, and entertainment venues, you can hear conversations like this at any time: "It's really cheap, a dan of rice is not even the price of one meal!" In the midst of this common conversation, prices suddenly jump again, and the people of Guilin can only sigh in frustration!</p>

<p>[Question from Mr. Song Zhizheng] I am a bachelor and share a room with two colleagues. Recently, my girlfriend came to my dormitory early in the morning to see me. Some people saw a woman come to the men's dormitory early in the morning, which inevitably aroused some curiosity. Afterwards, they asked my two colleagues about it. Their answer was: "She slept here last night!" As a result, the news spread like wildfire. Suppose this news reaches her parents' ears and they issue a warning to me. How should I deal with it? Have they committed the crime of defamation under the law? Can I file a complaint? I hope you can give me some guidance!</p>
<p>[Answer from Mr. Tang Mingshi] In the West, men and women enjoy freedom in their interactions, but freedom has certain boundaries. For example, when visiting, a girlfriend should never enter her boyfriend's bedroom or dormitory. Like a melon field or plum tree, one should be self-restrained to avoid gossip. The same applies to a boyfriend visiting a girlfriend. In conservative European countries, girlfriends are often accompanied when visiting, and boyfriends are often supervised by their parents when visiting girlfriends to avoid suspicion. Your girlfriend's actions are somewhat lacking in prudence.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the newly revised National Treasury Cash Management Accounting System, the inter-branch transfer procedures for district treasuries have been improved. However, the mailing of payment orders and the handling of stop-payment and re-appropriation procedures are still too complicated and difficult to coordinate with the new system.</p>
<p>It is now learned that the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has discussed and decided with the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance that, starting from the 38th year of the Republic, the mailing of all payment orders will be changed so that the National Treasury Department directly sends them to the district branches for processing, instead of being sent by the National Treasury for forwarding, except for the areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Anhui, which will temporarily continue to be handled as before. As for stop-payment, re-appropriation and other procedures, the fund-receiving agencies in each district will also directly discuss with the department and inform the district branches for processing, without the need to submit them to the general treasury for review, in order to simplify the process.</p>

<p>According to a statement from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation representative, the second batch of Taiwan sugar transported to Japan, totaling 20,000 tons, has now been completely shipped. The last portion of 1,500 tons arrived in Japan within the past week. They are currently preparing the third batch for transport and sale. Furthermore, recognizing that weeding expenses account for a significant portion of sugarcane cultivation costs annually, and that weeds in sugarcane fields grow rapidly between May and July, making them difficult to manage, the company is seeking to reduce the cost of Taiwan sugar sales in order to expand sales channels and compete with sugar production in the international market and other countries. A special plan has been initiated to use herbicides instead of manual labor. They have already begun investigating the types, forms, growth conditions, and distribution of weeds in sugarcane fields in various production areas. Upon completion of the trial, it will also be a major contribution to agriculture in our country.</p>

<p>[Xi'an Correspondence] Cotton prices, which had been hovering around 470 yuan per dan (unit of weight), plummeted to 400 yuan per dan in the past week. Meanwhile, air freight rates have increased by 50 percent, effectively ending air transport of cotton. The prospects for Shaanxi cotton exports suddenly appear bleak.</p>
<p>It is reported that since the establishment of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office in this city, the planned purchase volume of Shaanxi cotton was estimated to be 600,000 city dan. Subsequently, due to the lifting of price controls, it was changed to free purchase. In this city, only the Central Bank, the China Textile Company, and Yongxing Company participated in the joint purchase. The initial batch of purchase certificates amounted to 40,000 dan, but due to funding issues, they were temporarily suspended before the purchase was completed. Most of the cotton purchased this time comes from the Jinghui Canal area. They are currently busy with packaging and transportation work. The cotton purchased in Weinan has all been sent to the Weinan packaging factory for repackaging and direct transport to Baoji. In order to save time and avoid losses, those purchased in the Jinggang Canal area have signed a contract with the Provincial Highway Bureau to transport the cotton to Xianyang for repackaging, and then directly to Baoji for consolidation.</p>
<p>For transportation from Baoji to Chongqing, in addition to the contract already signed with the Fifth District Transportation Office, the ten new vehicles purchased by the Provincial Highway Bureau in Nanjing will also join the transportation effort after they arrive in Baoji. Land transport is based on Chongqing as the final destination. With the increase in vehicles, exports should not be a problem. However, it is said that water transport from Chongqing to Shanghai is often difficult due to the shortage of riverboats. Shaanxi cotton concentrated in Chongqing cannot be transported to the east as much as possible, which has caused many purchasers to remain on the sidelines, affecting the price of Shaanxi cotton and making it difficult to improve the situation.</p>
