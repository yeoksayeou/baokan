<h3>翁文灝呈請辭職照准　提任孫科長行政院　各部會首長下週可決定　總統命令及咨文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕總統廿六日令，（一）行政院院長翁文灝呈請辭職，情詞懇摯，翁文灝准免本職，此令。（二）提任孫科爲行政院院長，此令。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕蔣總統提名孫科爲行政院院長，廿六日咨請立院同意之統（一）字第二五號咨文如次：「行政院院長翁文灝辭職照准，擬以孫科爲行政院院長，查孫君曾任行政·立法兩院院長，交通·財政·鐵道等部部長有年，經騐豐富，勳望卓著，深信必能勝任愉快，爰依憲法第五十五條第一項之規定，咨請同意，以便任命，此咨立法院，總統蔣中正」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕久懸未決之行政院長問題，廿六日以急轉直下之姿態，順利解決。立法院長孫科轉任行憲後第二任行政院長，已於廿六日上下午分別獲得國民黨中常會通過及立院大多數之同意，前任院長翁文灝及各部會首長之總辭，同時亦獲允准。孫氏之政院，並將以新作風出現，延攪各方有力人士參加，加强陣容，建立舉黨一致之新政院，一新國內，國際人士之耳目。據悉：孫科轉任行政院長之決定，爲總統以較長時期愼重考慮研究之結果，於廿五日向孫氏提出，孫氏係日前赴滬，正擬入中比鐳錠醫院醫療腿疾，突於廿五日晨兩度獲總統之長途電話，囑其務必當日來京，共商要事。孫氏乃於廿五日午返京，當晚晋謁總統長談兩小時，總統當吿以擬請孫氏出長政院，共濟時艱，經詳細研商結果，孫氏允予考慮。廿六日上午十時總統復親蒞立院，以十五分鐘之時間聽取孫氏應允組閣之答覆，旋總統卽以國民黨總裁身份主持中常會，通過孫氏之任命，當午再以總統身份來文咨請立法院進行同意投票，立院投票結果公布時爲下午四時廿分，其進行之順利及迅速，與前次翁閣之產生逈不能比，惟孫氏以醫病關係，就職期將延至一週後</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕此間政界人士咸認，孫科出任行政院長之意義，至爲重大，蓋此舉非僅解決傘延四週之翁院長辭職間題，使幾瀕停頓之政務得以繼續推進，且醞釀多日之戰時體制問題，亦將藉孫科組織新政院而具體實現。孫氏應允考慮出任行政院長時，聞曾要求邀請最近數任行政院長及立院中重要領袖同時參加政院，俾加强戰時體制之力量，建立舉黨一致之內閣。若干人士相信，張羣·翁文灝·陳立夫等均有在新政院祖任職務之可能。孫氏之政院部會首長，將有相當之變動，允以外長一職爲然。廿六日晨中常會通過孫科任命後，京中卽盛傳郭泰祺將任外長，另有人謂張羣若能參加政院，或將畀以外長一席，亦未可知。然此均屬推測之詞。孫氏之政院首長名單，恐須下週內始能決定發表，在孫氏新政院組成前，一切政務仍由翁閣負責，惟翁氏多日未蒞院辦公，實際係由張厲生主持，以待孫氏就職辦理交接。</p>
<h3>立院行使同意權　在五十分鐘內完成投票　立法院長由陳立夫代理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕立法院廿六午十二時半接獲總統提名孫科爲行政院院長，請予同意之咨文後，卽迅將投票，準備完成，並於午後例會中行使同意權，以五十分鐘之時間，使空懸已久之新閣揆順利產生。下午三時半續開第廿三次會議，陳副院長主席，經徵得會衆贊同，變更議事日程，先處理總統依憲法第五十五條第一項之規定，提名孫科爲行政院長資請同意案，秘書長張鑒元宣讀總統咨文後，各委員於堂聲中無異議通過，省略全院委員會議審查之程序，因之，對由院咨請總統通知所提人提出施政意見一節，亦認無必要，當卽逕行投票，推定程天放，陳紫楓，武和軒，除公遂四委員監票，自下午三時三刻開始，於極融洽之空氣中投票，各立委分目發言台左右兩側魚貫登主席台，領票圈寫後，投入票匭，再由靠會塲兩壁之階梯回至原席次，歷廿分鐘投票完畢，復當塲開票，至四時一刻主席陳副院長宣布投票結果，計出席委員二七五人，發出票數二七五張，開出二七四張，其中廢票二張，有效票二七二張，同意票爲二二八張，不同意票爲四十四張，決議同意總統提各孫科爲行政院院長，會衆當再報以熟烈掌聲，至此，原爲立法院院長之孫科，遂在其絕大多數同僚支持下，膺任行憲後第二任內閣閣揆。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕現任立法院院長孫科廿六日經總統提名及立法院同意出任行政院院長後依憲法第七十五條「立法委員不得兼任官吏」之規定，其立法委員及院長之身份，應隨總統之提任命令而喪失，則依立法院組織法第十八條業二項「立法院院長因事故不能視事時，由副院長代理其職務」之規定，其職務將由現任副院長陳立夫代理，至於院長之選舉，則將俟總統提任命令發表後，由程序委會定期行之，如屆時陳立夫氏當選爲院長，其副院長之遺缺，亦須改選新人。</p>
<h3>孫科來滬　繼續醫治腿疾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕孫科以腿疾待醫，廿六日晚乘車赴滬診治，預定二三日後返京，再行提出政委及各部會首長名單，請由總統任命。又孫氏午間曾宴許祟智氏，並請于右任，居正，戴傳賢，王寵惠，吳鐵城等作陪，席間並未談及組閣事。</p>
<h3>徐傳霖發表觀感　盼孫氏整頓人事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕孫科組閣訊傳出後，各方人士均寄以厚望，盼新閣早日組成，主持政務。民社黨徐傳霖發表觀感稱：孫氏能在此國事艱困之今日出而組閣，其魄力當爲吾人所欽佩，惟尙盼孫氏能整頓人事，調整陣容，多插新人，則前途未可限量也</p>
<h3>中政會秘書長　張羣繼任</h3>
<p>中常會議通過　孫科長行政院</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕國民黨中常會廿六日上午十時舉行臨時會，由蔣總裁親自主持，會中通過准翁文灝辭行政院長職，以孫科繼任，該案之通過極爲順利，出席委員一致同意。其次通過張羣繼任中政會秘書長案，會後蔣總裁卽以總統身份提名孫科繼任政院長，咨請立院同意。</p>
<h3>宋子文飛港</h3>
<p>王雲五霍寳樹飛穗</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿六日電〕宋子文廿六日下午飛港度週末，定廿八日返穗，宋夫人及許世　·陸文瑜等隨行。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕前財政部長王雲五，廿六日晨偕夫人由京飛穗，渠將在廣州小住後，卽返原籍中山掃墓。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕輸管會主委霍寳樹，廿六日晨由滬飛粵。按霍氏前曾在粵主持華南經濟管制督導事宜，於三週前自廣州飛京述職後卽返上海，主持該會會務迄今。</p>
<h3>彭學沛定今晉京</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕我出席聯合國大會代表彭學沛氏，前日抵滬後，定今日晋京述職。記者昨訪晤彭氏，叩以此次由歐洲經美國返國一行之感想，據談：美國之援助終將實現，惟民主國家措施難免遲緩，然此僅爲時間問題。</p>
<h3>立院通過電美參衆兩院　請美國加速援華　說明我戰爭為反侵略性</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕立院第二會期第廿三次會議，廿六日舉行，上午九時三刻由孫院長主席宣吿開會，卽進行報吿事項，通過前次會議議事錄，並經羅衝對渠所提裁撤民航局案之決議文略作修正後，各委員對總統咨送修正金圓券發行辦法及人民所有金·銀·外幣處理辦法，請查照案，政院爲答復對濟南戰事失利責任之質問，咨請查照案，均無異議，至政院咨請審議之中國向美購買N3型貨船十艘貸款合約案，設立印度太平洋漁業理事會協定案，國際電信公約案及考試院咨請審議勳章條例修正草案案，則分別交付審查。十時半開始進行討論事項：（一）總統咨為靑島外圍宣吿臨時戒嚴，請查照追認案，決議通過，予以追認。（二）交通·外交兩委會報吿審查國際郵政公約及各項協定中文譯本案案，決議照案通過。（三）社會農林及水利兩委會報吿審查農會法修正草案案，經吳望伋說明審查經過後，會塲突吿停電，休息後仍未復明，會議乃無法繼續，十一時散會。下午三時半續會，陳副院長主席，先改變議程，討論依憲法第五十五條第一項之規定，總統提名孫科爲行政院院長，咨請同意案，並進行投票，予以同意，復繼續午前未畢議程第三案後農會法修正草案，決議修正通過。（四）社會委會報吿審查修正合作社法第十六條條文草案案，決議通過，就該條文修正爲「新股金額每股至少十圓，至多一百圓，在同一社內，必須一律」（五）衛生刑法兩委會報吿審查解剖屍體條例草案案，決議通過。最後並通過程天放等八十八人臨時動議，請以本院全體委員名義，致電美國參·衆兩院，說明我國戰爭性質爲反侵略性，並請加强援華案，晚六時散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕立法院今日下午會議中，通過委員程天放等八十八人所提臨時動議，請以立院全體委員名義，致電美國參衆兩院，說明我國戰事性質，中國人民對反侵略戰爭之決心，並請求加速援華案，案文如下：查中國共產黨爲國際侵略集團之工具，其稱兵作亂實欲征服中國，使中國夷爲侵略國家之附庸，然後再利用中國之人力資源，進而侵略他國，以達到共產國際所標榜之「世界革命」之目標。因此我國之戡亂軍事，實爲國際性質之反侵略戰，不幸過去政府對此點未作普遍宣傳，致友邦人士誤認中國戡亂係內戰性質，與其他國家不生關係。最近軍事失利，東北整個淪於匪手，加以幣制改革遭受挫折，遂使人心動搖，對於政府自多責難之辭。共黨乃乘機造謠謂中國政府不復爲人民所愛戴，崩潰已不在遠，友邦人士爲此種　言所惑，對中國局勢發生消極悲觀之心理，認中國已不可救藥。凡此種種均可直接影響美國援華之行動，而間接影響戡亂戰事之進行。本院爲立法機關代表民意，澄淸國際視聽，責無旁貸，用特提議請以本院全體委員名義，致電美國參衆兩院，說明下列各點：（一）中國不僅爲國家獨立民族生存而戰，亦爲世界和平與安全及自由與民主而戰。凡屬愛好和平，祟尙民主之國家與中國休威相關，在道義上均有援助中國之義務。（二）中國人民對此戰禍蔓延，經濟恐慌，生活艱苦之際，對政府目不免有怨言，政府過去措施亦不免有錯誤，然對於反共戡亂之基本國策，則全國人民除極少數別有用心甘爲侵略國虎倀者外均一致擁護，期以最大決心與努力，消弭中國之赤禍。立法委員爲選民所舉，自可代表全民表示此意。同時對內政之改革，及美援之有效運用，亦必盡其力量監督實施。（三）中美兩國百餘年來邦交素睦，第二次世界大戰，中美爲比肩作戰之盟友，今中國又受集權國家之侵略，以獨力抵抗强權，中國倘不幸失敗，美國安全與世界和平均將受威脅。故美國政府此時加速以軍事及經濟力量援華，不惟解救中國之危機，實亦美國之自救。</p>

<h3>孫科組閣與美國援華</h3>
<p>在半個月來中樞當局若有若無的狀態中，在國民焦急之極而仰望有一個責任內閣的呼聲中，昨天總統徵得立法院院長孫科氏的同意，提任行政院院長，下午已得立法院投票大多數的通過，並且特別免除了　法上規定行政院長向立法院長報吿施政方針的程序，使新院長可以在極短期間迅速組閣。這在對內爭取剿匪勝利和對外爭取盟邦援助的緊要關頭，不可謂非差强人意的快事</p>
<p>目前，人民所渴盼的，不外兩點：（一）對內，有一新耳目深合民心的開明措施，使政府眞正建築其基礎於平民擁護的肩膀上。（二）對外，一掃過去妄想做中蘇橋樑，以「兩元外交」相標榜的誤國觀念，開誠布公的與美國商談加强援華的互惠互助辦法，使中國成爲信仰民主反抗極權的國際陣營中有力的一員。必如此，中國政府的戡亂才能取得最後的勝利，建國才能保障最大的成功。</p>
<p>孫院長組閣的人才陣容，與其財政，經濟，敎育文化等等對內的政策如何，今姑稍緩置論，這裏所先要指出的，必須首先宣布中國今後的外交政策，應該誠心誠意的與美國携手，使此大平洋兩岸有傳統友誼的兩大國更密切的接合起來，阻遏共產極權的狂潮泛濫於整個亞洲與太平洋。中國政府必須在此次新閣的改組中，輸入新血液，顯示新生機，堅定信心，奮發自助，然後可以取得人助，而美援之及時與加强乃可爲勢所必至之事。</p>
<p>在孫院長奉命組閣之前夕，美國馬歇爾國務卿適向新聞記者發表美國對於中國最近求援的態度，他說，「共黨在中國得勢雖極可慮，但在援華方面决將審慎從事。」馬卿談話雖極盡其含蓄與閃爍的能事，但美國對於世界局勢一籌莫展的苦悶，却暴露無遺了。在呼籲「更多更快」的援助的我們中國人民聽來，雖並沒有因此而就威到失望，但對於美國當局固執成見，先歐後亞所可能造成的未來惡果，究不能不爲全世界人類，表示深切的扼腕。</p>
<p>馬卿自巴黎返美，立卽與杜魯門總統會商中國局勢，在華府與倫敦之間，也曾就中國局勢澈底交換意見。同時，美國安全委員會更連日開會，檢討世界局勢，據合衆社的報道，所討論的問題有下列各項：（一）美國能否從共產主義中將中國拯救出來？（二）如欲加緊援華則將採取何種辦法？（三）如若大舉援華，是否影響美國國內通貨膨脹？（四）又大舉援華是否會損及美國的援歐計劃？此外，馬卿個人更要顧慮及未來八十一屆國會的對華態度。所以美國政府在此時只有彷徨躊躇，馬卿也只有苦悶煩惱。</p>
<p>美國的對華政策究將怎樣？一般學者專家以爲美國只有四條路可走。。（一）是繼續目前有限的援華；（二）是鼓勵中國政府與共產黨組織聯合政府；（三）是在經濟上，軍事上，政治上全力援助中國、以免全國的赤化；（四）是美國的不問不聞，實行全面總退却，不僅退出中國，而且退出整個亞洲。但由我們看來，援助有如行醫，藥性不足等於不服，過了時效也等於未醫，故有限的援助，無濟於事，而此時奢談「聯合政府」，更是不切實際，無異要迫使中國走上波蘭捷克……之路，卽爲蘇聯赤色鐵幕以內的犧牲者。事實非常明顯，美國若不立卽全力援華，在經濟上，在軍事上，作「更多更快」的援助，以堅決貫澈反共防蘇的杜魯門主義，則祗有自願退出中國，根本放棄亞洲，縮小其反共防蘇的杜魯門主義的範圍於西歐一隅而已。然而，不欲反共防蘇則已，否則丟開了四萬萬人的中國乃至十萬萬人的亞洲於不顧，而想達到阻遏共產極權的狂潮，直如夢囈！</p>
<p>反之，在我們中國一方面，旣要求援於美國，便得在外交上表示更明朗的態度。勝利以還的三年中，最要不得的是中國應作美蘇「橋樑」的騎牆觀念！這些自以爲取巧的外交官，往往說這樣才能保持中國的獨立，維護世界的和平。殊不知中國在國際間應該先有一個明確的是非觀念和恩怨分明的理智辨別。美國對我廢除不平等條約，而蘇聯則新從中國取得特權；美國協助我國受降復員，而蘇聯則給予反政府的共黨以發動叛亂的支援；美國經　援助中國，準備與我經濟合作，而蘇聯則自東北攫取大量物資以阻碍我國的復興，…凡此種種，誰是朋友，還不够明白嗎？可是，我們的外交當局，居然還想在尋求美援的同時，向蘇聯送媚眼，而以爲超然於美蘇之間有「調人」作橋樑的資格。這種空想幻想，讓一個人去做夢原無不可，其奈貽誤了國家大局何！</p>
<p>老實說來，孫院長的新內閣，如果要打開一條出路，使人民和友邦覺得眞有新希望，除了在人選上在內政上有澈底的刷新而外，第一應該着手而且最重要的，莫過於拋棄似是而非的「二元外交」，坦白眞誠的與美國携手互助，以取得更多更快的援助，遏止赤色鐵幕在亞洲的擴張。</p>

<h3>東條等今晨可能絞決　美軍防衛愈嚴密　東條妻要求執行後發遼屍體</h3>

<p>〔合衆社東京廿六日電〕據合衆社自巢鴨監獄之可靠靈通人仕處獲悉：獄內正建造新絞台四座，以處決東條及其他被判絞刑之戰犯六人。東條等在待死期中，獄內之防衛異常周密。普通之囚徒均二人合居一室，但渠等七人則每人獨居一室，每室並特別加派武裝之美軍一人看守，室門並不加鎖，入晚則洞開，俾守衛者一見室內動靜，卽可入內。</p>
<p>渠等曾被帶往美軍醫院嚴格檢視，並以X光透視渠等是否在體中藏有毒藥，每晚均經常檢査，以判斷渠等之呼吸是否正常，每日之飯餐，已不由日籍廚司料理，一切日人均禁止與彼等接觸，以防止渠等自外界獲得毒物，晚間睡眠時，規定以頭正向洞開之室門。據稱：渠等雖强作鎭定，但日來飯量已銳减，性情乖戾，形同暴徒，東條在數日內已减輕兩磅，麥帥之最後裁定發表後，最受打擊者爲廣田，蓋渠曾預期麥帥至少能赦其一死，改判無期徒刑。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿六日電〕東條英機之妻，廿六日以陳情書一份上呈麥帥，要求東條及從犯六人處刑後，其屍體交還家屬安葬·蓋東條之妻以爲戰犯受刑後，遺體不擬發還家屬。第八軍長華克吿合衆社稱；東條及其從犯之屍體，將與其他戰犯之遺骸同樣處理。然華氏抵日不久，故坦白承認：「本人實在不明其他戰犯之處置辦法。」</p>

<p>韓駐華大使月杪來華</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿六日電〕韓總統李承晚今稱，韓政府及議會必須立卽提出要求，談美軍駐留南韓，因美方無意在此留駐軍隊。李氏今晨於記者會中稱，外界現有各種誤解，認爲韓人不欲美軍駐留，此種誤解之由來，係因若干議員於數星期前曾提出外國軍隊自韓國撤出之建議。李氏稱：「該議案已遭擱置，然美國及其他外國人士皆紛紛傳聞，並以此爲韓國人民之願望」。又稱；「在絲國足以自衛幷達到統一之前，美軍不應撤出南韓」。記者詢以韓國須若干時日始能力足自衛？李氏表示，渠爲一樂觀主義者，故深信在政府機構移交完畢後，卽可達此目的。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿六日電〕韓外交部宣布，韓駐華領大使街代表鄭桓範，將於廿九日或卅日離此乘輪赴華就職。鄭氏之隨員三人，日定明日飛華，以進行必要佈置。鄭博士爲前韓國世運代表團長，一九四三年曾參加流亡重慶之韓國臨時政府，並一度爲之　大學敎授。</p>

<h3>柏林爭端不易解決　四強覆文即公布　中立國不放棄調解努力</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕對勃拉馬路里亞關於柏林問題微詢意見書之答覆，原文將於今日下午發表。四國覆文所以延期公佈，係循蘇代表維辛斯基之請求，俾渠有時間向莫斯科請示。同時勃拉馬格里亞本人則將赴羅馬作四日之遊，於月底返已黎，然後再於十二月十日前返國。渠所担任之安理會主席任期在年底卽吿結束。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕安理會六中立國代表今晚又舉行會議，由勃拉馬格里亞任主席，繼續硏究四國對柏林幣制問題之覆文。據某外交方面稱，目前仍有希望擬定能由雙方接受之解決幣制計劃。該方面又稱，英法照會中對建立幣制機構事宜曾有詳細之提議，對中立國之努力頗有帮助。總之，外傳中立國將放棄其調處之謠言，乃完全無稽云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿五日電〕消息靈通方面息：美英法三國已吿勃拉馬格里亞稱，勃氏解決柏林爭端之企圖已注定失敗，其意卽謂安理會根據目前基礎　解柏林危議，已瀕於絶望。所請目前基礎，卽未認蘇聯發行之東德馬克為柏林唯一幣制，以換取蘇聯之解除對鎖，美英法早已要求勃氏發表三國之覆文，旨在表示彼等對柏林問題之政策仍屬一致。英法兩國另向勃氏提出備念錄，以表示彼等對於幣制問題之意見時，西方盟國間已有岐見。西方盟國目前企圖雖有此種小意見之出入，但在冷戰中仍保持堅强陣綫。</p>
<h3>有權參加魯爾工業管制　法達成外交目標　參院議長由蒙納維蟬聯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿五日電〕法政府發言人今日稱，美國務卿馬歇爾昨日提議邀請法國參加魯爾區鋼鐵與煤礦管理，法國自當加以接受。魯爾雖不在法佔區內，但馬氏此種邀請實爲正當步驟。法國現在至少已滿足其兩大要求之一，卽在對德和約正式訂立前之時期內，法國有權參加魯爾工業之管理。</p>

<h3>美西海岸工潮結束　訂三年不罷工契約　歷時八十餘日糾紛告一段落</h3>
<p>〔合衆社舊金山廿六日電〕產業職工大會所屬之西海岸碼頭工人工會代表，業於廿五日晚與資方代表達成協議，訂立三年不罷工之契約，該項契約將分送工會及雇主批准。就廿六日之情勢而言，歷時已達八十六日之西海岸罷工，可望於下星期結束。資方發言人預測，因罷工而未起卸之船上貨物，可能將於下星期一，二開始起卸。但在其他雇主與其他三罷工工會未達成協議以前，船隻仍不致復航。不過一般均認爲，碼頭工會罷工之解決爲問題之關鍵，其他之三罷工團體：產業職工大會所屬之海船廚司及賬房工會，獨立之救火員工會及產業職工大會所屬之無綫電收音員工會，必將受其影響。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿六日電〕阿拉伯集團發言人卽叙利亞代表柯里今日在聯大政委會動議取消以色列國及產生由阿人控制之巴勒斯坦。但此舉之失敗可以預卜。柯里提此議時，正値美國重申反對逕自通過貝那多特計劃，蓋英美對聖地問題之處置，意見仍大相逕庭。美國要求政委會拒絶通過英國所提巴勒斯坦解決方案之重要部份，而接受較爲寬弛之美國修正案。</p>

<h3>當局嚴格執行戒嚴令　禁罷工罷敎行動　市政會議通過處理工潮三辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長及宣司令，爲執行戒嚴令，嚴禁罷工罷敎，特於昨日下午五時半，在市政府聯合招待記者有所報吿。首由宣司令致詞，略稱：國軍展開徐蚌會戰後，政府感於維護治安刻不容緩，特公佈京滬區緊急戒嚴令，凡屬影響治安之一切舉動，均予嚴禁。在戒嚴令下，人民一部份目由之目當受到限制，極屬明顯·惟奈本市有若干人士，不能了解其意義，在戒嚴令公佈之後，竟有罷工怠工及以「請假」爲名，而實行罷工之事件連續發生，擾亂社會秩序，陷人心於極度不安。經本人與吳市長商量結果，認爲在此時此地，人民所最需要者，厥爲安定，目前政府之主要職責，亦在保持安定，嚴防潛伏份子乘機散播謠言，擾亂治安，故經會同決定，如今後有不遑之徒，在此煽動風潮者，不論爲工人或其他階層人士，本部必將執法以繩。政府頒佈之戒嚴法令中，可明罷工罷敎須予嚴禁，爲首者將予嚴懲。際此動盪時期，政府固須顧及工人之生活問題，惟對於整個治安，工廠生產，及社會秩序之維護，亦須顧及。勞資有糾紛時，可由工人團體負責人向資方提出要求，惟要求必須合情合理，萬一勞資不能協調時，可請求主管機關（卽社會局）作公允調處。今後如勞方提出要求苛刻不合情理，且進行不合手續時，皆屬違反戒嚴法，當局將嚴辦爲首者。</p>
<p>本人希望今日談話發表後，太市各種風潮卽可絶跡，包括工人，公務員，及敎職員在內。此番市立及私立學校之敎員，先後以「請假」爲名，實行罷敎，實屬遺憾。固然敎師之生活甚爲淸苦，然如與軍人相較，則已優越好幾倍。軍人在如此困苦環境中尙且爲國奮戰，希望其他人士亦能效法。際此國家苦難多端之時，爲民者務項節衣縮食，刻苦耐勞，俾共渡難關，任何階層人士均不應作特殊要求，滿足一己。</p>
<p>繼由吳市長報吿昨日市政會議中所通過之處理工潮辦法三點如：（一）各工會之要求必須經由工會通過提出，否則政府一概不予考慮。（二）工會於提出要求後，須循法律途徑謀取解決，卽靜候當局之調解，仲裁或評斷，在此期間內不准有任何罷工怠工情事發生，如有此類情事發生者，准資方予以無條件解雇。（三）當局並追究煽動者，依法嚴辦之。</p>

<h3>銀樓第一日生意淸淡　金管局指示營業方針</h3>
<p>本市銀樓業，昨日全體復業，綜計全日各店營業情况除各大同行稍見擁擠外，其餘同業均未若想像之熱鬧·</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於此次銀棋復業，昨日下午四時，金管局負責人特召集該業公會代表談話，用作復業時懇切之指示，大意如下：</p>
<p>（一）各銀樓金飾售價，每兩規定包括金價·工資·營業費用及利潤在內，最高不得超過二千一百元，每日由各銀樓遵服核定價格掛牌，所以作此硬性規定，因倘銀樓牌價過高，匪特乏人問津，抑且刺激市塲。（二）上項出售金飾價格，係按九九五以上之成色計算，如果不足九九五者，應照價遞滅·過去本市銀樓業大同行飾金成色確甚可靠，但近來仍舊已漸混亂，所謂足赤者，僅有九九〇·九八〇，甚或更少成色，現中央銀行售金以十足成色兌出，倘銀樓減低成色出售，無異從中多一種剝削。（三）工資最高不得超過中央銀行金價百分之五十，此點固與第一項售出金飾價格計算有關，而不容更易，再則過去銀樓工資曾彈性規定，視製造精粗，由百分之五十至百分之一百，實際各銀樓均按最高標準百分之一百計算，爲重視事實，免生取巧牟利，不得不加硬性規定。（四）過去銀樓業因有種種顧慮，交易數量價格等，在帳册上均欠翔實記載，此次復業以後，必須遵照規定逐筆登帳。</p>

<h3>市長召集校長談話　決定四項辦法　准私校收費一至三倍　全部補助敎職員生活　限即日復敎至遲不得過下週一</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長爲解決私校增收學費事，於昨日下午三時在市府會議室召集本市私立中小學校畏舉行談話會，到各校校長二百餘人，由吳市長主席，當卽決定四點如下：（一）准各私立學校酌量增收學費之一倍至三倍，全部充作補助敎職員生活之用。（二）凡有學校已收四倍者，須比例增加其免費學額（按敎育局規定，各私立學校之免費額。不得少於百分之二十）。（三）限令各校今日復敎，至遲不得過下星期一。（四）勸令筱快樂對各私校停止謾駡。</p>
<p>希望校長自我檢討</p>
<p>昨日席間空氣緊張衝動，討論達三小時始散。首由吳市長闡明今日談話在於檢討事實，追究責任，並妥謀解決之道。渠歷述私校敎職員聯誼會於本月十一日至市府要求發給特種配米及緊急補助費，及市府處理之經過，認爲此次私校擅自收費，實不合理。結果造成敎員總請假之僵持局面，校長應該相互檢討其責任所在。</p>
<p>市長提出　問題一串</p>
<p>市和英特爾：政府自認領導無方，固不能辭其咎，惟私立中小學聯誼會對此番擅自收費，是否亦屬輕舉妄動？按理私校經費有困難，校長應向董事會提出請求解決，萬一解決不了，再向市府請予協助，請問是否各校均已向董事會提請解決過？目前各校大部份敎師總請假，各位校長態度又如何？學費是一次付淸的，各校是否一次發給敎員？未發款項是否存儲實物？上列各項問題，務請校長一一予以自我檢討，才是解決事件之道。</p>
<p>校長申訴　處境困苦</p>
<p>市長詞畢，各校校長相繼發表意見，說明學校處境之困苦，增收學費確係由於敎員生活過於淸苦，遭各界辱駡，實屬枉招不白之冤，各校增收學費，願全部充作敎職員之生活補助費，爲顧全學生學業計，願盡力勸導各校敎職員卽日復敎云云。最後商決辦法四點如上，談話會迄六時餘散。</p>
<h3>國立院校假期　仍照原訂校曆</h3>
<p>本市若干私立院校，因經費困難及學生伙食不繼，擬分別予以增收費用或提前二週放假，前均有所決定。至本市各國立院校上課時間，是否亦有縮短情形，頃據復且，交大等校校長章益，王子卓諸氏語記者稱：國立院校目前雖亦受物價波動，經費短紬，但爲維持學生學業計，決照原訂校曆上課放假，不擬有所變更。</p>

<h3>北水電公司　籲請節約用電</h3>
<p>本市煤斤來源，日趨困難，首遭影響者，爲公用事業中之各電廠。據閘北水電公司負責人談：該公司自九月份起，僅能照核定配額，領到六成，致三個月來，積存備甩燃煤，動用一空，十一月份按照實際應用額，需煤一萬一千餘噸（亦卽規定配額），但截至卽日止，僅領到五千噸，不足二分之一，發電數量，因此大减，爰經於十一月十一日起，重行訂定電力用戶輪流停電日期，並規定在傍晚最高負荷時間，一律停止馬達用電，實行以來，初時尙能應付，至近日仍感不足，其原因在：（一）氣候日寒，用戶使用電熱取暖，（二）竊用電熱增加，（三）電力用戶不能遵守輪流停電，及最高負荷停電時間照常開用馬達，致不得不臨時分別拉電，連帶影響一部份電燈用戶，不特居民感覺不便，卽公司調度，亦十分困難，無法維持，除考慮硬性規定分區停電外，並無較爲妥善辦法，仍望一般用戶，開誠合作，切勿使用電熱，及遵守公司調度，方可渡此難關云。</p>

<h3>滬市知名領袖人士　集團發動革新運動　主張澈底改進軍政經濟　曾與京滬美國關係方面保持接觸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市英文大美晚報昨載稱：此間政界消息，本市若干知名而有權威之領袖人士，刻正集團發動一革新運動，以挽救當前之危局。該一集團之組成者，有國內著名之工商企業家，銀行家，報紙編輯，大學校長，技術專家及職業人士等，渠等多願爲推進此一革新運動而耗費光陰及金錢，惟不願顯露姓氏，該一集團形成後，曾與駐京滬之美國各關係方面，保持接觸。</p>
<p>據該集團之某發言人談稱：余等一致之意見，雖望美援增加，惟中國對自助必須努力，俾使中國有獲得外援之價値。該集團之澈底革新計劃，包括軍事，經濟及政治各方面。軍事行政方面，渠等認爲軍需供應部份，尤須澈底改進，俾戰爭器材得以公允劃一分配，物資之耗損及貪汚亦得以根除。故渠等主張軍需供應制度之上，應有國外顧問及指導制度之設置。又軍餉待遇問題亦立待改革，「勿吃空額」之制度須立付有效實施，如需外援，仍當籲請。關於軍事參謀工作，不但須採納國外之建議，同時須切實付諸實施。故現有之參謀部組織，應立卽改組。</p>
<p>經濟方面，渠等主張兩點：（一）立卽嚴格劃分私人及政府工商企業之範疇。（二）應有現實計劃，以吸引國外之投資。對合法之私人企業，應予以充份之經濟自由，政府現時已侵入各私人企業之範圍者，應卽退出。對國外之投資及貿易方面，渠等認爲內河航行權，應卽賦予外商輪船公司。對不受軍事影響各地區內之工商企業，如獲外商投資，尤須予以最惠國條款之優遇。中國固須選擇何國方應享受最惠國條款之優遇，惟中國應放棄以學理之態度，以研究此處之主權問題。</p>
<p>政治方面，渠等力主責任內閣制，嚴格秉承憲法執政，係根據法律而非法令施政。除非該一政治制度得以有效實施，中國之前途將賡續黯淡。</p>
<p>該發言人復稱：余等刻正全力以推進此一革新運動，決不「束手待斃」，蓋目前革新及推進自助運動之時機，仍未過晚。刻余等初步工作，已將革新計劃面陳政府，余等茲將繼續推進此一運動，直至獲得結果而後已。</p>
<h3>滬各界聯電美政府　呼籲援華刻不容緩　迅予道義上物質上援助　俾得及時避免歷史慘劇</h3>
<p>上海市參議會議長潘公展，上海市商會理事長徐寄廣，全國紡聯會理事長杜月笙，全國工業總會聯合會理事長劉鴻生，全國商聯會理事長王曉籟、全國銀行公會聯合會理事長李銘，全國錢業公會聯合會理事長秦潤卿，全國電氣業公會聯合會理事長錢永銘，上海市總工會理事長周學湘，上海巾伴師公會常務理事江一平，上海市會計師公會常務理事何元明，上海市醫師公會常務理事朱忠道，上海市記者公會常務理事馮有眞等，日昨聯名致電美國杜魯門總統，巴克萊副總統，馬歇爾國務卿，呼籲加强美援。茲探譯其大意如下：</p>
<p>已下作戰到底決心</p>
<p>當此決定生死存亡之際，我國人民不得不向閣下及貴國人民呼籲。假如欲及時避免此人類歷史上之大慘劇數萬萬愛好和平之士女，被迫而受共產黨之迪克推多統治，則貴國必須加以援助，刻不容緩。吾人保證中國國民政府已下作戰到底之決心，此不僅爲維持吾人自已之自由與獨立計、亦所以爲阻止亞洲赤禍之蔓延計，蓋舍此並無他法，亦實無他路可走也。試問在共黨指揮下之和平，吾人如何能取得自由幸福，將來更有何希望可言？捷克，羅馬尼亞，波闌事件之發生，已使吾人對共黨所鼓次之「聯合政府」，不敢再存任何幻想之希望。</p>
<p>在時間上不能再緩</p>
<p>共黨如一旦控制吾全國，卽鐵幕包圍亞洲之信號。從此太平洋上，將無自由貿易往來，以及經營任何企業之可能。須知貴國與吾國及全世界，對於維護和平以及穩定遠東之利害關係，乃整個而不可分離者。在此可怖的黑暗之　將臨之際，實不容吾人再事袖手坐視。吾人將尋求有效之革新政治計劃，以期波過難關。惟吾人之資力有限，且在時間上，亦有不能再緩之勢，因此不得不向閣下作將伯之呼，以閣下及貴國人民之愛好目由，必能寄以同情，予以援助，庶幾迅速收效，時不我待，惟閣下實利圖之。</p>
<p>迅採行動合力支持</p>
<p>又本市公私立各大學校長吳淸泰·章益·凌憲揚·歐元懷·胡敦復·胡文耀·朱經農等，昨亦有聯名電發致美總統杜魯門，副總統巴克萊，及國務卿馬歇爾，原電大意如次：吾人籲請閣下注意，吾國方與共黨作殊死戰，以减除其控制亞洲之威脅，此乃貴國利益與吾國國運休戚相關者，必待貴國迅速定策，採取行動，合力以支持之也。過去戰事，雖然挫折，但在徐州一役，我軍民不惜以互大之生命代價，擊退共黨軍隊，因此爭得此寳貴之時機。以吾人之決心與毅力，加之以貴國之友好而有效之援助，同心協力，必可繼續持久奮鬥。吾人所慮者，在貴國不能及時赴援，吾人再遭挫　，則貴國國策以及在遠東之利益，勢亦必大受其影響，以至不可收拾。吾人以爲貴國在此時，必不忍置吾政府與人民於不顧，否則亞洲將全歸共黨控制，此同貴國所決不欲輕輕放棄者也。蓋亞洲若置於共黨鐵幕之中，而受極權主義者之統治，則貴國昔日太平洋戰爭中所犧牲之無數生命，不啻擲諸虛牝。</p>
<p>無東地位將受封鎖</p>
<p>吾人亦自知我政府中之種種缺點，遠過於國外人士所知，然此爲國內惟一可恃而又有力之政洽機構，決不肯與共黨妥協者也。吾人實不能想像貴國如棄現政府而求所謂「聯合政府」之結果，蓋所謂「聯合政府」不啻爲共黨所指揮之政府，勢必損害貴國重要利益，而貴國在遠東之地位，將受其封鎖而動搖也。因此，吾人不得不籲請貴國決定政策，迅予吾國以道義上及物質上之援助，俾吾國在軍事。經濟及政治上，得以逐漸穩定，以期刷新一切，自力更生，時機急迫，必須在共黨未曾控制吾國及亞洲之前，加以援手，則幸甚矣。</p>

<h3>海關工潮解決後　紗布南運正式開始</h3>
<p>本市紗布南運問題，雖已經政院下令開禁，但因最近幾天，適逢海關怠工關係，故實際上並朱啓運。昨起海關怠工風潮已吿解決，紗布南運工作，旋吿正式開始。據關係方面透露：統計以往數年來本市紗布南運數量，卅六年一月至六月，共運紗二五，九五五件，布七，〇七七，七〇七疋。卅六年七月至十二月，紗四三，八六四件，布一，一一五，七二三疋。卅七年一月份，紗六五，九八四件，布一七二，六八二疋。卅七年二月份，政府採取緊急措施，宣布禁止紗布南運，俾以全面供本市需要。至卅七年四月間，南運又經政府下令局部開放，惟至八月底，政府爲加强經濟管制，南運旋又吿停止，直至目前始，又經政府下令開禁云。</p>
<h3>棉紗激漲</h3>
<p>昨日以紗布正式南運，本市交易頓轉繁榮，廣東帮進胃特健，本街紗號等亦有吸納。又兼銀根　濫，人心興奮逾恒。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初喊卽吿上揚七百元，開後各方貿氣旺盛，見費卽進，市盤再升一千元，高見一萬四千五百元。旋因乘高獲利出籠，迨近收時，回低至一萬三千三百元結束，此上日續漲五百元。</p>
<p>廿一支雙馬紗，初盤跳升二百元，交易鼎盛，中途再挺五百餘元，高至一萬零五六百元。嗣以浮戶了吐，回小至一萬元收盤，軋升二百元。其他各支粗細紗，亦均步秀三四百元至七八百元不一。</p>
<h3>布疋穩俏</h3>
<p>棉布市勢，因紗價飛揚，人心奇悄，執貨者扳特益力，本街代廣帮搜購甚夥。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布喊價，初盤四　元，交易暢盛，步挺至四百十五元有成交。嗣因門莊實銷未見開展，抵補不多，北帮以價格倒掛，逢高脫售。迨近收時，回低至三百九十五元結束，較上日軋跌十五元。四君子元嗶嘰最後價三百九十元，亦小十五元，高檔一九〇士林布做七百元，低檔六自三五卡元，交易平庸。</p>
<h3>金圓券發行額</h3>
<p>國行否認超過卅億元</p>
<p>據悉：按照當初金圓券發行辦法規定金圓券種類，計爲一元，五元，十元，五十元，一百元五種，至最近國行發行之二十元票面金圓劵，實不在當初發行金圓夯種類之內，故外間傳說金圓券之發行額，已超過卅億元，較當初發行總額增加百分之五十，但市塲現鈔，仍感缺乏，貼水現象，時有發生。聯合徵信所記者昨反特以此間題，詢諸國行發行局負責人，據吿稱：金圓劵發行額，已超過三十億元，全非事實。現鈔缺乏，少數係受存款兌換黃金銀元影響，發行二十元面票金圓劵，係代替發行原定之五十元及一百元大額金圓劵，以免刺激物價，故是項大額金圓券，市塲上尙不易見到云。</p>
<h3>兌換金銀　人數見增</h3>
<p>央行等四國家銀行，目開辦款存兌現以來，開始之初，因受現鈔缺乏影響，申請者並不踴躍，惟自前日起，情形突變，昨日雖細雨濛濛，然各行兌換處均出現一字長蛇陣。據熟悉個中詳情者談：此係受日來金鈔黑市上升之影響，且擠兌羣中，頗不乏黃牛云。</p>
<p>又訊；據國行昨日發表，廿五日一日中，本市計兌出黃金三千三百九十一兩零七分七，收圓金圓劵三百册九萬一千零七十七元，銀幣部份，共兌出三萬六千一百五十九元，收回企圓劵卅六萬一千五百九十元，連問定存兩共收回金圓劵七百五十萬五千三百卅四元。</p>
<h3>外匯移轉證上升</h3>
<p>昨成交三四十萬元</p>
<p>外匯移轉證布價，昨突上升，最初倣廿五元半光景，旋因進口商已領得限額分配證者紛往結匯，價猛升至廿七元半，旋稍回爲廿七元，成交亦已增至三四十萬元云。</p>
<h3>七八兩季限額　決定不予放寬</h3>
<p>轍出入管理委員會之第七八兩季限額早已公佈，惟迄目前止，工商業方面仍多請求輸管會放寬此二季進口限額。</p>
<p>昨據該會負責人談稱：第七八兩季限額，決定不再放寬，該會爲求增加工商界進口原料或物資起見，准將該二季限額提早分配，且進出口貿易實施聯鎖後，進口商可設法進口之物資極多，此後進口物資，祗有增加不會减少云。</p>
<h3>絲綢激漲</h3>
<p>人絲昨日走勢鋒俏，人心高强，業外紗布飛騰，乘內游覽充斥市上買風展關，午收一致軋升。</p>
<p>120號天橋關盤現貨一一〇〇〇元，塲上納　不惡，旋卽喊高千元，高後供者尙稀，木街進意尙濃，喊價再高五百元，銳勢甚挺。關因散戶吐售不絶，市稍回平，終以一二〇〇〇元了結，東洋一二五〇〇元收束，均較上日札升千元。</p>
<p>生絲昨日市况亦俏，趨勢相同，本街絲織業納　　暢，同業供應甚稀，期現貨均軋升一千餘元。</p>
<p>D級7878匀度，初開現貨一三〇〇〇元，開後一路上升，高見一五〇〇〇元新高峯，優級零担初開市氣甚悄，開盤喊價卽高，中間步盤步高，各帮採購仍旺，趨勢未見遜色，收市一致挺秀。</p>
<h3>食米到量價挫　麵粉食油均稍轉昂</h3>
<p>米市仍走下坡，夭氣雖雨，到貨仍多，米店納胃，依然懈淡，是以兜售頗感不易，價格因走再見貶低，南北市同吿下降。白粳南市四百五十元，下跌十元。薄稻早稻降十元或十五元，早稻退入四百元關內，陰元銷呆，猛跌三十元。北市價格白粳小五元，早薄稻亦低十元，昨日到貨南市三七二八石，北市四七五二石。</p>
<p>麵粉市勢，略見轉昂，因連日下跌，價格已低，本街見低補取，市氣吿活，價乃上挺。老車粉一百四十五元，兵船送到一百四十元，各昂五元，紅蜂及孔雀等雜牌粉，一致加升五六元。麩皮廠方有供，市見下降，大麩小二元，小包麩六十四元，小麥廠盤一百八十五元。</p>
<p>雜糧價格漲跌俱有，漢口乍豆初開平定，後以豆餅價昂，故稍轉挺，收市一百六十元。平湖杜豆小十多元，苞米北帮胃口甚懈，市價下沉，下跌五元。紅糧因酒坊進取，交易活潑，挺升五元。芝蔴轉堅，加砌一二十元，茶豆揀靑平定，生仁先來後平。</p>
<p>食油稍稍轉挺，因連日下降已為低價，貨主扳堅，故早市挺升，廠方開豆油價七百九十元，後七百八十元，計升三十元。生菜油收市六百二十元，計挺十元，生油站原價，江北吉生油仍爲九百六十元，小車蔴油及熟菜油各升三十元。豆餅客帮續納，先升後疲，軋升六七元。</p>
<h3>杭市易長</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿五日訊〕因公赴京的周企虞市長返杭甫及兩日，以曾任三屆前後二十年的老市長辭職相聞，繼任人選爲曾任上海市民食調節會主委現任浙省物資運用委會的主委任顯羣氏。企虞先生，我們相識有三年的光陰，顯羣先生於最近幾次約會上傾談頗多，在杭市人心思變的情形下，企虞先生的走，與顯羣先生的來，可謂均適其時。</p>
<p>重心區的一環</p>
<p>杭州市雖非院轄市，但誠如市參會請改院轄市的理由說：「杭市密邇京滬，遠接皖贛，輪軌輻輳，交通便利…是以在經濟上形成全國重心區之一環，至於名勝風景，尤爲舉世所咸知。」所以杭州市更易一市長，必須得中央同意，甚至須得總統同意，杭市人民也有如此感覺。在與周前市長的三年交情中，覺得周氏是很爲能幹，譬如他知道「杭州三冬靠一春，」收入全賴遊覽客人，所以積極整頓遊覽區，幾條整齊的柏油馬路，風景區的加以刷新，達官顯爵住食之準備。周氏在三十七年二月中曾對記者談：「現在幣制貶値，一切都不好辦，戰前市府每年經費三百萬元，每月經常費十五萬元，用來應付裕如，現在數字鹿大，反有顧此失彼之感，眞是困難。</p>
<p>經費是否困難</p>
<p>事後，我曾請敎很多財政經濟專家，他們說：「杭州並不是財政虧虛，而也不必開發稅源，增重民負，只要好好地執行現有的稅則，已可用之不盡了。例如民生主義規定的地債稅，應該按照土地增佱增加，　報者收購，政府無財力，但可租與平民，而平民的租費卽可償還謊報者的地優，所以間題全在執行上。」企虞先生何嘗不知道這些，無如因人事太熟，資格太老，因爲人熟資深，以故一切事情只要周市長一個電話，都能解決。也因為周市長時以電話相商，所以有些事情，也只要去和市長談談卽可解決。找市長的人多了，市長也覺得習以為常，只要地方上沒有怨言，中央倚重，卽使財政虧蝕，中央與省可獲補助，也就不必再找麻煩。</p>
<p>杭州市的遠景</p>
<p>周市長對杭州市的遠景，我曾和他談過，他說：「希望杭州成爲東方的好萊塢。」而且他又說，九溪十八澗等處已有凖備。後來，布雷先生來杭，與記者共遊山水，他指給我看裏西湖山上的石墩，他說：「當年企虞兄曾鼓勵滬人在山上築屋，後因戰亂而罷。」當然，這已是至少十多年前的事了。但是十多年以後，在不是承平世界的時候，人民的需要不同，人民的想像也不同了。</p>
<p>精神上的苦悶</p>
<p>依我這三年來和杭市人民的接觸，人民所需要的是衣，食，住，行的解決，他們出了捐稅，眼看修的是柏油路，整理的是名勝。米珠薪桂，有增無已，精神上復沒有慰藉，感到非常的苦悶。記者曾在市參議會請願改院轄市時，爲「杭州！往何處去」一文，裏面指出杭州應以建爲文化城爲指標，而以人民的文化城爲目的。因爲人民需要的除了物質外，還有精神的食糧，因爲精神食糧是反映人民的需要，所以精神食糧也卽是物質食糧的契機。所以「院轄市的名義，也不必僅求在政治上的提高，而其實際的精神上已崇高無比了。」無如「建議由他建議」，雖然前任浙江圖書館長陳訓慈先生來函表示同情，但是書生畢竟只是書生而已。</p>
<p>任氏爽朗活潑</p>
<p>現在，新任市長任顯羣先生，他自己說：「第一次做地方行政官」，所以「不受包圍，決不徇私，不與地方惡勢力妥協，眞正爲人民服務」。任氏與記者交往雖淺，但「換換新的試試」之下，當必有所作爲。記者與任氏傾談，他說：「對杭州的施政，做一步是一步，對建設文化城當亦極同意」。任氏是爽朗活潑的人，過去在台灣與上海都有好的聲譽。我熱望他保持過去的光榮，把握現在人民的企求，來保證將來杭州的光輝。</p>
<h3>南通離奇謀殺案　時光華飮彈斃命</h3>
<p>〔本報南通廿三日訊〕本邑頃發生一離奇命案，出事地點在城西起鳳橋畔之蘆廢塲，綠有皖籍賣糖女汪桂英，有弟名成林，隨姐夫譚庭光，當勤務兵，本月二十一日，汪女爲先親除靈，注之親戚王恒當偕同時光華（卽死者），來城至汪家酬應，入夜，客人散盡汪女邀時住鄰人葛松高家陪同飲酒，時竟大醉，旋扶回汪家，甫抵家，突有槍聲一響，時已彈中頭部斃命。事被兩武裝同志盤問，汪　答語支吾，乃一併解總局審理。現警局已將此案移送地檢處。</p>

<h3>說自私</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>虛妄爲人事之大弊。羅素著懷疑論集，開宗明義。卽提出「凡有所見，必有所據」之原則Eorm　opinion　on　evid-ence，簡譯其意，無非卽是「戒虛妄」三個大字。全書雖凡二十餘萬言，而其所反覆闡明者只是這個意思。</p>
<p>這個意思雖淺，然做來却難，J·奧斯丁說：「任何人事上的透露很少是完全的眞相，，總得略爲掩飾一些，稍許不實一些。」蓋亦是慨乎言之也。至視莫如父子夫妻，然相互間所言所語亦難以做到全眞地步。</p>
<p>此於政敎國事爲尤然。三二友朋相聚，茶餘酒後，一涉政事，輒互謂某事必須如何，某案不應那樣；或謂這樣必不可，那樣一定會有效。彼此侃侃而談，口沫四濺，聽其語氣頗爲肯定，觀其神情極有把握，一如只要如此做去，一切都可迎刃而解者然。</p>
<p>實則這類論調，其大半非由於愚，必基於私。嘗見兒女衆多之家率多主張節制生育，單丁獨傳的人每多贊成獎勵生育；弱者常斥「弱肉强食」爲殘忍，强者轉以惟有「淘汰弱者」始足以言富國强種。他如民族工業家之倡言抵制洋貨，囤貨之流的反對高利政策說是高利貸足以刺激物價上升，職業慈善家之勸人慷慨解囊多積陰功，老　階級之對夥計講究誠實之益，力主不可楷油等等，考其實際，大都只是基於私利，爲一己之私囊着想耳。</p>
<p>但所奇者，一人專謀私利，恒爲人所不齒，然同是此人，一且身爲代表爲議員爲駐外使節，此時却以力爭私利爲常規爲正大光明，其所代表之國體之選民之國家亦恐其不以私利爲重，只要他越能爭取私利，便越可博得好代表好議員好使節之盛譽。若不然者，於有所主張，悉以對方之權益爲指歸，以所代表者之利益爲卑不足道，如此作風，、其不爲人目爲神經有病者幾希。甚且其對立之集團亦將訝其不智，視之爲無能。</p>
<p>嘗思今之所謂「代議政治」者，無非卽是集各界各業各國體各階層的私利專家於一堂，各人力陳其私見，然後折衷之妥協之，使之成立一個爲各人所不滿所憤慨的議案而已。各位議員爲謀「私見」之成爲「公意」，自必於本身不利之事實則故意漠視之忽略之，於己有利之論據則不惜繁引博徵，藉使取信於衆。如此，欲冀其出言大公無私全爲眞實，誠不啻緣木而求魚。民主如美國，其所謂民主政治，亦如斯而已，豈有他哉。</p>
<h3>專門偽造文書的人</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>雖然是假的，但是也要做得過眞。在一幕考究的電影中，不僅典章文物要配合時間與空間的背景，就是法令文吿的簽署也要仿製得維妙維肖。</p>
<p>在好萊塢就有這麽一位「僞造文書」的老手：格里菲茲·艾利斯。他受僱於華納兄弟公司，他的特殊的工作就是複製簽名和其他的文件，以供銀幕上各種不同的需用。</p>

<h3>故事一則</h3>
<p>— 堇</p>
<p>最近爲了金圓券貶値，許多私立中小學紛紛要加收「第二次」學雜費，來維持敎師的生活。敎師說，我們薪水一向少，受了這種空前的物價。跳數十倍的狂漲，實在無可維持；家長方面呢，認爲開學時所付的金圓券也很値錢，當時可以買上好幾担米，現在再要交什麼「第二次」，可有點難以遵命。於是，「罷敎」「請假」相繼而來，形成了敎育界「空前」「嚴重」的大問題。</p>
<p>我不打算爲那一邊辯護，事實上也不能絶對地說那邊對，那邊不對，因爲這只是整個問題中的一點小問題，大問題沒有解決的時候，小問題也只能永是問題。在這裏，我只想說一個故事，一個眞實的故事。</p>
<p>且說有這麼一個私立中學，辦得也還不錯，敎師的待遇也還合理；但是，合理不就是够過活，物價急遽直升，校方想使敎師能够定定心，決定也來一次「第二次」收費。佈吿貼了出去，期限規定得明明白白的，會計處坐待一大堆金圓券滾滾而來。不料事與願遠，限期快到了，會計處前仍是門可羅雀。校方着急了，暗暗偵査之下，原來學生們實行「聯合拒繳」，領導的是全校的最高班——高三，高三中的「主腦人物」也給偵査了出來。於是本「擒賊先擒王」的古訓，校方立刻簽下「傳票」，將該「犯」傳到了作爲臨時法庭的辦公室</p>
<p>審詢之後，繼以調查該「犯」種種有關情况，將註册單翻開一看，也許是事有凑巧，使辦案者不由得感到「棘手」，原來該「犯」的家長正是現任的本校敎師！消息傳佈極快，一會就傳到了那位家長兼敎師的耳中，迫得這位先生「羞憤交集」，在辦公室裏大罵大閙，說非令該「犯」滾蛋不司。</p>
<p>故事發展到這裏已達最高潮，再下面應該是一個結束了。抱　得很，這故事的結局現在還不得而知，而且，以情理度之，也只好不了了之了。可以補充的一點是，這「犯人」還因是「敎職員子弟」而享受着免費待遇呢！道一點，使我們更不能決定這位「犯人」的「功」「過」，因爲他的行爲從另一方面講，正是全不爲己的急公好義的行爲！</p>
<p>讀者看完了這個故事，倒底發生什麽感想，當然隨讀者自己的意。在這裏，我倒想提出一個問題：假使有一個敎師，他有兩個兒子（或女兒）在中學讀書。要是贊成收第二次費罷，他自己可以得到四五百元，但也要付出四五百元給他的兒子或女兒繳掉；他百己仍是什麼也得不到。那麽，聰明的讀者，他是該贊成收第二次學雜費呢，還是該反對。</p>
<h3>動物的敏感</h3>
<p>— 別謙</p>
<p>在廣大的自然界裏，許許多多的動物都具有超人的感官，發揮出驚人的敏感能力，使我們位居萬物之靈的人類望塵莫及！狗的嗅覺，貓的視覺……等等，都是我們所素知的，然而尙有許多昆虫爬虫之類，牠們的官能之敏銳，眞可以達到使人不能相信的程度。</p>
<p>有一種飛虫，味覺的官能特別敏銳，牠能嚐得出幾乎近於眞正無味的滋味。我們人類的味覺，如果拿一杯極淡的糖水來試騐，其最大的感覺限度是一分糖溶解於二百分的水中，如果超過了這限度，任你再敏感的舌頭也只能承認它是一杯純淡的白水而已。可是若拿這種飛虫的呋覺能力來比較，眞如小巫之見大巫，牠竟能在一份糖四萬份水的溶液中嚐出它的甜味！還有更令人驚異者，美洲有種美麗的蝴蝶，據昆虫學家多次的試騐，證明其辨別味覺的能力，居然能發現一份糖三十萬份水的溶液的糖味。</p>
<p>蜜蜂有估計時間能力，如果我們每天在固定的時間把食物置在外面，則蜜蜂會凖時而來，決不會有五分鐘以上的差誤，宛如看了鐘表一樣。</p>
<h3>海紅樓詞</h3>
<p>— 徐少夢</p>
<p>菩薩蠻題畫</p>
<p>沈沈好夢如雲膩，困人天氣惺忪起。疏柳　風柔，滄江不斷流。片帆黃海掛，握手烽烟夜，何處是桃源？傷心畫裏看。</p>
<p>蝶戀花春情</p>
<p>一搦春魂銷幾許？十疊屛山，遮斷凌波路。寳馬香車游治處，落花風碎幽禽語。如此韶光難久駐，儘是多情，總被無情誤！雨也絲絲雲也絮，心機織盡相思縷。</p>

        <h1>1948.11.27</h1>
<h3>Approved Resignation of Weng Wenhao, Sun Ke Appointed as President of the Executive Yuan, Heads of Ministries and Commissions to be Decided Next Week, Presidential Orders and Official Communications</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Presidential order on the 26th: (1) Weng Wenhao, President of the Executive Yuan, requested to resign from his position with sincere words and earnest requests. Weng Wenhao is hereby permitted to resign from his current position. This order is issued. (2) Sun Ke is hereby appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan. This order is issued.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] President Chiang nominated Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan. The official communication No. 25, asking the Legislative Yuan for approval on the 26th, is as follows: "Weng Wenhao, President of the Executive Yuan, is approved to resign. It is proposed to appoint Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan. Mr. Sun has served as President of both the Executive and Legislative Yuan, and as Minister of Communications, Finance, and Railways for many years. He has rich experience and outstanding reputation. I am confident that he will be able to fulfill the role happily. Therefore, in accordance with Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, I hereby request your approval so that he can be appointed. This is communicated to the Legislative Yuan, President Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The long-pending issue of the President of the Executive Yuan was successfully resolved on the 26th with a sudden turn of events. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, was transferred to become the second President of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution. This was approved by the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the majority of the Legislative Yuan on the morning and afternoon of the 26th, respectively. The resignation of the former President, Weng Wenhao, and the heads of various ministries and commissions was also approved at the same time. Sun's Executive Yuan will appear with a new style, inviting powerful figures from all sides to participate, strengthening the lineup, and establishing a new Executive Yuan with the unity of the entire party, refreshing the ears and eyes of domestic and international figures. It is reported that the decision to transfer Sun Ke to the President of the Executive Yuan was the result of President's careful consideration and research over a long period. He proposed it to Sun on the 25th. Sun was planning to go to Shanghai to the Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital for medical treatment of his leg ailment. Suddenly, on the morning of the 25th, he received two long-distance calls from the President, instructing him to come to Nanjing that day to discuss important matters. Sun returned to Nanjing at noon on the 25th and visited the President that evening for a long talk of two hours. The President told him that he intended to invite Sun to head the Executive Yuan and overcome the current difficulties together. After detailed discussions, Sun agreed to consider. At 10:00 am on the 26th, the President personally visited the Legislative Yuan to listen to Sun's reply to form a cabinet in 15 minutes. Immediately afterwards, the President, in his capacity as the Director-General of the Kuomintang, presided over the Central Standing Committee and approved Sun's appointment. At noon, in his capacity as the President, he sent a letter to the Legislative Yuan to conduct a consent vote. The results of the Legislative Yuan's vote were announced at 4:20 pm. The smoothness and speed of the process were incomparable to the previous formation of Weng's cabinet. However, due to medical reasons, Sun's inauguration will be postponed for a week.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Political figures here generally believe that Sun Ke's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan is of great significance. This move not only resolves the issue of President Weng's resignation, which has been delayed for four weeks, allowing the almost-stalled government affairs to continue to advance, but also the wartime system issue, which has been brewing for many days, will be concretely realized through Sun Ke's organization of a new Executive Yuan. It is said that when Sun agreed to consider taking office as President of the Executive Yuan, he requested that the recent past Presidents of the Executive Yuan and important leaders of the Legislative Yuan be invited to participate in the Executive Yuan at the same time, in order to strengthen the power of the wartime system and establish a cabinet with the unity of the entire party. Some people believe that Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Chen Lifu, and others may all have the possibility of holding positions in the new Executive Yuan. There will be considerable changes in the heads of ministries and commissions in Sun's Executive Yuan, and the position of Foreign Minister is expected to be so. After the Central Standing Committee approved Sun Ke's appointment on the morning of the 26th, it was widely rumored in Nanjing that Guo Taiqi would serve as Foreign Minister. Others said that if Zhang Qun could participate in the Executive Yuan, he might be given the position of Foreign Minister, but this is unknown. However, these are all speculations. The list of heads of ministries and commissions in Sun's Executive Yuan may not be decided and announced until next week. Before Sun's new Executive Yuan is formed, all government affairs will still be the responsibility of Weng's cabinet. However, Weng has not been to the Executive Yuan to work for many days. In fact, Zhang Lisheng is in charge, waiting for Sun to take office and handle the handover.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Exercises the Right of Consent, Completing the Vote in Fifty Minutes, Chen Lifu Acts as President of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After receiving the President's official communication nominating Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan at 12:30 pm on the 26th, the Legislative Yuan quickly prepared for the vote and exercised the right of consent at the afternoon regular meeting. In fifty minutes, the long-vacant new Premier was successfully produced. At 3:30 pm, the 23rd meeting continued, chaired by Vice President Chen. With the consent of the members, the agenda was changed to first handle the case of the President's nomination of Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan in accordance with Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, requesting consent. After Secretary-General Zhang Jianyuan read the President's official communication, the members unanimously passed it in the hall, omitting the procedure of review by the Committee of the Whole. Therefore, it was also considered unnecessary to request the President to notify the nominee to submit policy opinions. The vote was immediately conducted, and Cheng Tianfang, Chen Zifeng, Wu Hexuan, and Chu Gongsu were appointed as four members to supervise the vote. Starting at 3:30 pm, the voting took place in a very harmonious atmosphere. The legislators went to the podium on the left and right sides in an orderly manner, collected the ballots, marked them, and put them into the ballot box. Then, they returned to their original seats via the stairs on both sides of the hall. The voting was completed in 20 minutes. The ballots were then opened on the spot. At 4:15 pm, Chairman Chen, the Vice President, announced the results of the vote. A total of 275 members attended, and 275 ballots were issued. 274 ballots were opened, including two invalid ballots and 272 valid ballots. The number of votes in favor was 228, and the number of votes against was 44. It was resolved to agree to the President's nomination of Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan. The members again responded with warm applause. At this point, Sun Ke, the original President of the Legislative Yuan, was elected as the second Premier of the cabinet after the implementation of the Constitution with the support of the vast majority of his colleagues.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After the current President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, was nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan on the 26th to take office as President of the Executive Yuan, in accordance with Article 75 of the Constitution, which states that "Legislators may not concurrently hold official positions," his status as a legislator and President of the Legislative Yuan should be lost with the President's appointment order. Then, in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph 2 of the Organizational Law of the Legislative Yuan, which states that "When the President of the Legislative Yuan is unable to attend to his duties due to an accident, the Vice President shall act on his behalf," his duties will be performed by the current Vice President, Chen Lifu. As for the election of the President, it will be held regularly by the Procedure Committee after the President's appointment order is issued. If Chen Lifu is elected as the President at that time, the vacancy of his Vice President will also need to be re-elected.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Comes to Shanghai to Continue Medical Treatment for His Leg Ailment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Sun Ke, who needs medical treatment for his leg ailment, took a car to Shanghai on the evening of the 26th for diagnosis and treatment. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing in two or three days to submit a list of political commissars and heads of ministries and commissions for the President to appoint. Also, Sun hosted a banquet for Xu Chongzhi at noon, and invited Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, and others to accompany him. The matter of forming a cabinet was not discussed during the banquet.</p>
<h3>Xu Chuanlin Expresses His Views, Hoping that Sun Will Reorganize Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After the news of Sun Ke's cabinet formation spread, people from all walks of life placed high hopes on it, hoping that the new cabinet would be formed as soon as possible to preside over government affairs. Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party expressed his views, saying: "Mr. Sun's ability to come forward and form a cabinet in today's difficult national affairs is admirable. However, it is hoped that Mr. Sun can reorganize personnel, adjust the lineup, and add more new people, then the future will be limitless."</p>
<h3>Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, Zhang Qun Succeeds</h3>
<p>Central Standing Committee Approves Sun Ke as Head of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a temporary meeting at 10:00 am on the 26th, personally presided over by Director-General Chiang. The meeting approved Weng Wenhao's resignation from the position of President of the Executive Yuan, with Sun Ke succeeding him. The passage of the case was extremely smooth, and the attending members unanimously agreed. Secondly, the case of Zhang Qun succeeding as Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee was approved. After the meeting, Director-General Chiang, in his capacity as the President, nominated Sun Ke to succeed as the President of the Executive Yuan and requested the Legislative Yuan for approval.</p>

<p>[This City News] Mr. Peng Xuepei, the representative of our country attending the United Nations General Assembly, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is scheduled to go to Beijing today to report on his work. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Peng and asked about his thoughts on his trip back to the country from Europe via the United States. According to him, American aid will eventually be realized, but the measures of democratic countries are inevitably slow, but this is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Passes a Telegram to the US Senate and House of Representatives, Asking the United States to Accelerate Aid to China, Explaining that Our War is Anti-Aggressive</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The 23rd meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 26th. At 9:45 am, President Sun declared the meeting open and proceeded with the reporting items. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved, and after Luo Chong made slight revisions to the resolution on his proposed abolition of the Civil Aviation Administration, the members unanimously agreed to the President's consultation cases for the revision of the Gold Yuan Coupon Issuance Measures and the Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Owned by the People, and the Executive Yuan's consultation case for answering the question of responsibility for the failure of the Jinan battle. The consultation case of the Executive Yuan for the review of the loan agreement for China's purchase of ten N3 type cargo ships from the United States, the agreement for the establishment of the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council, the International Telecommunications Convention, and the consultation case of the Examination Yuan for the review of the draft revision of the Medal Regulations were submitted for review.

First, the agenda was changed to discuss the case of the President's nomination of Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan in accordance with Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, requesting consent, and a vote was held to approve it.

The meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] At today's afternoon meeting of the Legislative Yuan, a temporary motion proposed by members Cheng Tianfang and other 88 people was passed, requesting that the United States Senate and House of Representatives be telegraphed in the name of all members of the Legislative Yuan, explaining the nature of our country's war, the Chinese people's determination to fight against aggression, and requesting to accelerate aid to China. The text of the motion is as follows: "It is found that the Chinese Communist Party is a tool of the international aggressive group. Their claim to use force is actually to conquer China, make China a vassal of an aggressive country, and then use China's human resources to further invade other countries in order to achieve the goal of 'world revolution' advocated by the Communist International. Therefore, our country's suppression of the rebellion is actually an anti-aggressive war of international nature. Unfortunately, the government has not made widespread publicity on this point in the past, causing friendly countries to mistakenly believe that China's suppression of the rebellion is a civil war and has no relationship with other countries. Recently, military failures, the entire northeast has fallen into the hands of bandits, and the currency reform has been frustrated, which has shaken people's hearts and caused many criticisms of the government. The Communist Party took the opportunity to spread rumors that the Chinese government is no longer loved by the people, and the collapse is not far away. Friendly countries are confused by these rumors and have a negative and pessimistic attitude towards the situation in China, believing that China is beyond salvation. All of this can directly affect the US aid to China and indirectly affect the progress of the suppression of the rebellion. Our hospital, as a legislative body representing public opinion, has the responsibility to clarify international views. Therefore, it is specially proposed to telegraph the United States Senate and House of Representatives in the name of all members of this hospital, explaining the following points: (1) China is not only fighting for national independence and national survival, but also for world peace and security, and freedom and democracy. All countries that love peace and respect democracy are closely related to China, and have a moral obligation to help China. (2) At this time of widespread war, economic panic, and difficult life, the Chinese people cannot avoid complaining about the government, and the government's past measures cannot avoid mistakes. However, the people of the whole country, except for a very small number of people who are intentionally willing to be accomplices of aggressive countries, unanimously support the basic national policy of anti-communism and suppression of rebellion, and hope to eliminate the red disaster in China with the greatest determination and effort. The legislators are elected by the voters and can represent the people to express this intention. At the same time, they will also do their best to supervise the implementation of domestic reforms and the effective use of US aid. (3) China and the United States have had friendly relations for more than a hundred years. During World War II, China and the United States were allies fighting side by side. Now China is again subject to aggression by totalitarian countries and resists strong powers alone. If China unfortunately fails, the security of the United States and world peace will be threatened. Therefore, the US government's acceleration of military and economic aid to China at this time is not only to relieve the crisis in China, but also to save the United States itself."</p>
<h3>After the Fall, Shenyang is Desolate and Terrifying, Waves of Grievance Spread Throughout the Northeastern Countryside</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Li Zongxi, Tianjin, 26th] After the fall, Panyang has become a chaotic, suffocating, desolate, and terrifying city. Shops are closed to prevent looting by rioters, and business has stopped. The market is deserted and unrecognizable. The prosperity of the past can no longer be seen. After the Communist bandits infiltrated the urban area on the afternoon of November 2, the roads were cut off and people were scarce, and gunfire rang out everywhere. From that night until noon on the 3rd, dense artillery fire continued to come from the southwest corner of the urban area. This was because some officers and soldiers of my 207th Division were still defending the last stronghold of Tiexi, fighting bravely as isolated troops. In particular, the six warriors of the Youth Army who guarded a certain fortress repeatedly refused to surrender to the bandit army, and used fierce artillery fire to inflict ruthless blows on the dozens of times more numerous bandit crowds who came to commit crimes, killing many bandits. The six warriors shouted "I would rather die than surrender," and fought hard with the bandits for a day and a night, until they ran out of ammunition and food, and the bunker was destroyed and people died. After the citizens learned about their loyalty, bravery, and heroic deeds, they were all moved to tears. The "Panyang Special City Military Control Committee" headed by bandit leader Chen Yun was established on the 3rd, and immediately began street inspections, creating all kinds of difficulties for pedestrians. Citizens hid in their homes and dared not go out. On the 4th, the bandit provincial and municipal governments began to work, and posted announcements to force public officials to report for duty through threats and inducements. Two newspapers are currently published by the bandits in Panyang, taking extremely strict measures to block news. Most of the newspapers are filled with absurd military news, and the rest are filled with remarks that poison people's minds. The people behind this "iron curtain" feel unparalleled suffocation and depression. In terms of economy, the "Trade Bureau" forces people to exchange gold yuan coupons for bandit coins at a very large ratio, and raises the price of gold in order to set up a gang to purchase civilian materials. The people of Panyang, who have lived a happy life for three years under the protection of the government, have almost no freedom to speak of so far, and are running away to the pass. The reporter disguised himself and escaped from Panyang in the early morning of the 11th. It was cold early outside the pass, and the cold wind in the suburbs was biting. The long Panyu Highway was filled with a large crowd who did not want to be "liberated." Bandit checkpoints were set up along the way, and they inquired and extorted in every possible way. Countless good people were detained. The bandits attached more importance to property than pedestrians. The "road pass" that they relied on as a talisman, so many refugees were able to safely escape to government areas after offering part of their property. The reporter was detained for one night in Xidianzi, four kilometers east of Tai'an, and the fountain pen, watch, and other items were plundered by the bandits. The Northeast Communist bandits are currently calling for fighting into the pass. Farmers' children from 18 to 35 years old in Liaozhong and Liaoxi are being forced to "join the army" and become cannon fodder. Waves of grievance have now spread throughout the northeastern countryside.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Suxian Lingbi Area, New Deployment of the National Army Completed, Annihilation War to Commence Immediately, Jinpu Railway Bengbu Section Open as Usual</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Gu Zhutong remained in Bengbu on the 26th, and convened a military conference in the morning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th] The great annihilation war in the Suxian area is about to break out. Liu bandits' 1st, 2nd, and 4th columns, and Chen Yi and Chen Geng's main columns have gathered in the east and west areas of Suxian. The National Army's Huang Wei and Li Yannian corps are advancing north in separate routes. Qiu Qingquan and Sun Yuanliang's two corps from Xuzhou are advancing rapidly in separate routes, sandwiching and attacking the main force of the Chen Liu bandits to the east and west of Suxian.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th] On the morning of the 26th, the reporter inspected the defense area of the Qiu Corps in Pantang, southeast of Xuzhou. According to Qiu Qingquan's report to the reporter, the bandits suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Xuzhou, but it still did not reach the ideal level. The first phase of the Battle of Xuzhou has ended, and the second phase will be launched in the Suxian area. The main force of the Chen bandits has gathered to the east of Suxian, and the main force of Liu Bocheng has gathered to the west of Suxian. The National Army has a new deployment. The bandits have a total of 600,000 people. A fierce battle is about to break out. Also, General Du Yuming told the reporter in Qianzhan that the east, west, and north sides of Xuzhou have been relieved, and there will be a major battle in the Suxian area in the south. The purpose of this battle is to annihilate the main force of the bandits, not to gain or lose a city or a place. The National Army has a new deployment. (News of the Sino-Foreign Journalists Group's interview with Qiu Qingquan will be published on page 2)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 26th] The fighting near Suxian was still very fierce on the 26th. The defending army of Lingbi has been in a hard battle since the evening of the 25th. The National Army is rushing to intercept. Military observers said that a large-scale battle will take place between Suxian and Lingbi in three or four days. The National Army is making deployments to annihilate the invading bandits. It is reported that the bandits fleeing south from the east of Xuzhou have been identified as four units, namely the 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th, and are commanded by Xu Shiyou.</p>
<p>Also, according to military officials, no main force of bandits has entered the south of the Huai River in Anhui Province. The news that more than 10,000 bandits had fled to the vicinity of Zhangbaling was only a small number of local communists. After the National Army of Mingguang attacked, the bandits retreated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] The Air Force of the Xuzhou base flew to the southern road of Xuzhou today to help in the battle. The Air Force discovered that the National Army's northbound soldiers were encountering large numbers of bandits fleeing south at 25 kilometers south and 20 kilometers southwest of Suxian. The Air Force immediately bombed the follow-up troops of the bandits, destroying many bandit fortifications and killing more than 2,000 bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] In this battle of Xubeng, our Air Force dispatched day and night, and cooperated with the Army to fight, annihilating many bandits, which was a great achievement. It is reported that in order to strengthen the battle, the Air Force authorities will expand the air force base in the shortest possible time to exert greater power. This step is being accelerated.</p>
<p>[This City News] According to reliable information from the transportation industry, passenger and freight transportation on the Pukou-Bengbu section of the Jinpu Railway was smooth as usual on the 26th and was not affected by the war at all. The rumors that traffic on this section was blocked are all unfounded rumors.</p>
<h3>Ke Shangyi Discussed in Chabei, No Contact in the Suburbs</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Cabinet and US Aid to China</h3>
<p>Amidst the vague state of the central authorities for the past half month, and in the extreme anxiety of the people who were yearning for a responsible cabinet, yesterday the President obtained the consent of Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and nominated him as the President of the Executive Yuan. In the afternoon, it was passed by a majority vote in the Legislative Yuan, and the procedure stipulated by law that the President of the Executive Yuan should report the policy guidelines to the President of the Legislative Yuan was specially waived, so that the new President can quickly form a cabinet in a very short period. At this critical moment for winning the internal suppression of bandits and seeking assistance from allied nations, this can be considered a fairly satisfactory and welcome event.</p>
<p>At present, what the people are eager for is nothing more than two points: (1) Internally, there should be new, refreshing, and popular enlightened measures, so that the government can truly build its foundation on the shoulders of the people's support. (2) Externally, the erroneous notion of wanting to be a bridge between China and the Soviet Union and touting "bipolar diplomacy" should be swept away, and sincere and open discussions should be held with the United States to strengthen mutually beneficial assistance to China, so that China can become a powerful member of the international camp that believes in democracy and resists totalitarianism. Only in this way can the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion achieve final victory, and the building of the nation can be guaranteed the greatest success.</p>
<p>How the talent lineup of President Sun's cabinet and its internal policies on finance, economy, education, and culture will be are matters for later discussion. What needs to be pointed out here first is that China's foreign policy should be announced first. It should sincerely join hands with the United States to more closely unite the two major countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, which have a traditional friendship, and to prevent the tide of communist totalitarianism from spreading throughout Asia and the Pacific. The Chinese government must inject new blood into this reorganization of the new cabinet, show a new vitality, strengthen confidence, and strive for self-reliance, so that it can obtain assistance from others, and timely and strengthened US aid can become a matter of course.</p>
<p>On the eve of President Sun's appointment to form a cabinet, US Secretary of State Marshall happened to issue a statement to reporters on the US attitude towards China's recent request for assistance. He said, "Although the rise of the Communist Party in China is extremely worrying, the aid to China will be carried out cautiously." Although Secretary Marshall's remarks were as euphemistic and evasive as possible, they revealed the US's distress at being at a loss for the world situation. We, the Chinese people, who are calling for "more and faster" assistance, did not feel disappointed because of this, but we cannot help but express our deep regret for the possible future consequences of the US authorities' adherence to their prejudices and giving priority to Europe over Asia.</p>
<p>After returning to the United States from Paris, Secretary Marshall immediately consulted with President Truman on the situation in China. Washington and London also thoroughly exchanged views on the situation in China. At the same time, the US Security Council held meetings for several days to review the world situation. According to a report by the United Press, the issues discussed included the following: (1) Can the United States save China from communism? (2) What measures will be taken if aid to China is to be increased? (3) Will large-scale aid to China affect domestic inflation in the United States? (4) Will large-scale aid to China harm the US aid to Europe plan? In addition, Secretary Marshall personally has to consider the attitude of the future 81st Congress towards China. Therefore, the US government can only hesitate at this time, and Secretary Marshall can only be distressed and annoyed.</p>
<p>What will the US policy towards China be? Scholars and experts generally believe that the United States has only four paths to take: (1) Continue the current limited aid to China; (2) Encourage the Chinese government to form a coalition government with the Communist Party; (3) Provide full economic, military, and political assistance to China to prevent the national redization; (4) The United States does not ask or listen, implements a complete withdrawal, not only withdrawing from China, but also withdrawing from the entire Asia. But from our point of view, assistance is like medical treatment, insufficient medicine is equivalent to not taking medicine, and expired medicine is equivalent to not being treated. Therefore, limited assistance is of no avail, and to talk about a "coalition government" at this time is even more impractical. It is tantamount to forcing China to take the road of Poland and Czechoslovakia... and become a victim within the Soviet red iron curtain. The fact is very obvious that if the United States does not immediately provide full assistance to China, economically and militarily, and provide "more and faster" assistance, to firmly implement the Truman Doctrine of anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union, then it will only voluntarily withdraw from China, fundamentally abandon Asia, and reduce the scope of its Truman Doctrine of anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union to a corner of Western Europe. However, if it does not want to oppose communism and defend against the Soviet Union, then it is already done. Otherwise, to disregard China with its 400 million people and even Asia with its 1 billion people, and to want to achieve the goal of preventing the tide of communist totalitarianism is like a dream!</p>
<p>Conversely, on the Chinese side, since it is seeking assistance from the United States, it must express a clearer attitude in diplomacy. In the three years since victory, the most undesirable thing has been the fence-sitting concept that China should be a "bridge" between the United States and the Soviet Union! These diplomats, who think they are clever, often say that this is the only way to maintain China's independence and safeguard world peace. However, China should first have a clear sense of right and wrong and a rational distinction between gratitude and resentment in the international arena. The United States abolished unequal treaties with us, while the Soviet Union newly obtained privileges from China; the United States assisted our country in accepting surrender and returning to their former posts, while the Soviet Union gave support to the anti-government Communist Party to launch a rebellion; the United States economically assisted China and prepared to cooperate with us economically, while the Soviet Union seized a large amount of materials from the Northeast to hinder our country's recovery... All of these, isn't it clear who is the friend? However, our diplomatic authorities still want to send flirtatious glances to the Soviet Union while seeking US aid, and think that they are detached from the United States and the Soviet Union and have the qualifications of a "mediator" to act as a bridge. It is originally okay for a person to dream of this kind of fantasy, but what about the serious mistake it makes to the overall national situation!</p>
<p>To be honest, if President Sun's new cabinet wants to open a path, so that the people and friendly nations feel that there is really new hope, in addition to a thorough refreshment in the selection of personnel and in domestic affairs, the first thing that should be started and the most important thing is to abandon the seemingly right but actually wrong "dual diplomacy" and frankly and sincerely join hands with the United States for mutual assistance, in order to obtain more and faster assistance and curb the expansion of the red iron curtain in Asia.</p>

<h3>The Largest Comet in 21 Years The Zijinshan Observatory Has Abundant Observation Gains</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The largest comet in nearly 21 years (1948-L) has been observed by the Zijinshan Observatory for ten days, and there have been very abundant gains. The night sky has been clear for ten days, which is very conducive to observation. The observers include Zhang Yuzhe, Chen Zunyu, and Li Hang. This comet is the twelfth one discovered this year and is named "1948-L" according to the usual astronomical practice of arranging them in alphabetical order. According to Mr. Zhang Yuzhe, its speed is about four times the diameter of the moon per day. The Harvard University Observatory in the United States and the Copenhagen Observatory in Denmark regularly report the comet's movements in advance to facilitate observations in various places. The Zijinshan Observatory in China is a card subscriber rather than a telegram subscriber, so it learns about it a little later. Fortunately, Shen Liangzhao, a student in the Physics Department of Tsinghua University in Peiping, discovered the star when observing a variable star in the Hydra constellation on the morning of the 11th, so it was still possible to observe it early. According to Mr. Li Hang, it is moving southwest by more than two degrees per day, and the luminosity of the comet's nucleus is gradually decreasing.</p>

They are checked regularly every night to determine if their breathing is normal. Their meals are no longer prepared by Japanese cooks, and all Japanese are prohibited from contacting them to prevent them from obtaining poison from the outside. When sleeping at night, they are required to face the open cell door with their heads. It is said that although they are trying to appear calm, their appetite has decreased sharply in recent days, their temperaments have become perverse, and they are acting like thugs. Tojo has lost two pounds in a few days. Hirota was the most affected after MacArthur's final decision was announced, as he had expected MacArthur to at least spare his life and commute his sentence to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] Tojo Hideki's wife submitted a petition to MacArthur on the 26th, requesting that after Tojo and the six accomplices are executed, their bodies be returned to their families for burial. Tojo's wife believes that the remains of war criminals will not be returned to their families after execution. Eighth Army Commander Walker told United Press that Tojo and his accomplices' bodies will be treated the same way as the remains of other war criminals. However, Walker, who has only recently arrived in Japan, frankly admitted, "I really don't know how other war criminals have been disposed of."</p>
<h3>News About Japanese War Criminals to be Released Uniformly by MacArthur</h3>
<p>Allied Reporters Again Request to Visit the Gallows</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur ordered tonight that all news regarding Japanese war criminals should be released by the General Headquarters Press Office. In other words, the Eighth Army, which is responsible for the executions, is not allowed to disclose news about the hanging of war criminals without authorization.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 26th] Eighth Army Commander Walker, who was appointed by MacArthur as the execution supervisor, refused Allied reporters this morning permission to visit the execution site when Tojo and the other six war criminals sentenced to death are hanged. At noon today, Allied reporters submitted a joint request to MacArthur's headquarters, strongly arguing that they have the right to visit the execution site to gather news.</p>
<h3>Keenan and Webb Depart Japan for the US and Australia</h3>

<h3>Syngman Rhee Repeatedly States That South Korea Needs US Troops Stationed There</h3>
<p>Korean Ambassador to China to Come to China at the End of the Month</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 26th] Korean President Syngman Rhee stated today that the Korean government and parliament must immediately submit a request to discuss the stationing of US troops in South Korea, as the US has no intention of keeping troops here. Rhee stated at a press conference this morning that there are various misunderstandings in the outside world that Koreans do not want US troops stationed here. These misunderstandings stem from a suggestion made by some congressmen several weeks ago to withdraw foreign troops from Korea. Rhee said, "That bill has been shelved, but the United States and other foreigners have been spreading rumors, taking it as the wish of the Korean people." He also stated, "US troops should not withdraw from South Korea until the country is capable of defending itself and achieving unification." When asked by reporters how long it would take for Korea to be strong enough to defend itself, Rhee stated that he is an optimist and believes that this goal can be achieved soon after the transfer of government institutions is completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 26th] The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the Korean Ambassador to China and representative, Jung Hwan-beom, will leave here by ship on the 29th or 30th to take office in China. Three of Jung's staff members are scheduled to fly to China tomorrow to make the necessary arrangements. Dr. Jung was the former head of the Korean World Games delegation, participated in the Korean Provisional Government in exile in Chongqing in 1943, and was once a university professor there.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Accuses the US of Supporting Right-Wing Japanese and German Groups</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] The Soviet Union accused the United States today of supporting fascist groups in Japan and Germany during the UN Social Committee's discussion of the draft Declaration of Human Rights. Soviet representative De Dinh Gu stated that MacArthur's occupation forces are supporting the revival of Japanese fascist groups. Another Soviet representative, Pavlov, stated that the remnants of fascism and Nazi groups are still active in West Germany and are receiving constant encouragement from the occupying authorities. The Soviet representatives used these remarks to support France's amendment to Article 28 of the declaration, which stipulates that no group may secretly use this declaration to undermine various human rights and freedoms, which was unanimously passed.</p>
<h3>The Berlin Dispute Is Not Easily Resolved; The Four Powers' Replies Will Be Published Soon; Neutral Countries Will Not Abandon Mediation Efforts</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The original text of the replies to Bramuglia's request for opinions on the Berlin issue will be published this afternoon. The reason for the delay in publishing the Four Powers' replies is due to a request from Soviet representative Vyshinsky, to allow him time to consult with Moscow. At the same time, Bramuglia himself will travel to Rome for a four-day trip, returning to Paris at the end of the month, and then returning to his country before December 10th. His term as President of the Security Council will end at the end of the year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The representatives of the six neutral countries on the Security Council held another meeting tonight, chaired by Bramuglia, to continue studying the Four Powers' replies on the Berlin currency issue. According to a diplomatic source, there is still hope of formulating a currency plan that can be accepted by both sides. The source also stated that the British and French notes contained detailed proposals on the establishment of a currency institution, which is helpful to the neutral countries' efforts. In short, the rumors that neutral countries will abandon their mediation efforts are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] Informed sources say that the United States, Britain, and France have told Bramuglia that his attempt to resolve the Berlin dispute is doomed to failure, meaning that the Security Council's resolution of the Berlin crisis based on the current foundation is on the verge of despair. The current foundation refers to not recognizing the East German mark issued by the Soviet Union as the sole currency of Berlin, in exchange for the Soviet Union lifting the blockade. The United States, Britain, and France had already requested that Bramuglia publish the three countries' replies, aiming to show that their policies on the Berlin issue remain consistent. When Britain and France separately submitted memorandums to Bramuglia to express their opinions on the currency issue, there were already differences of opinion among the Western allies. Although there are currently such small differences in opinion, the Western allies are still maintaining a strong front in the Cold War.</p>
<h3>France Achieves Diplomatic Goal by Having the Right to Participate in the Control of the Ruhr Industry; Monnerville Re-elected as President of the Senate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] A French government spokesman stated today that France will naturally accept US Secretary of State Marshall's proposal yesterday to invite France to participate in the management of steel and coal mines in the Ruhr area. Although the Ruhr is not within the French occupation zone, Marshall's invitation is a proper step. France has now at least satisfied one of its two major demands, namely, that France has the right to participate in the management of the Ruhr industry during the period before a formal peace treaty with Germany is signed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The chief representatives of the six countries attending the London Ruhr Conference held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the differences among the countries regarding the international control of the Ruhr and its organizational structure.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] Monnerville was re-elected as the President of the new Senate. Monnerville is a black man from French Guiana.</p>
<h3>US West Coast Labor Dispute Ends; Three-Year No-Strike Contract Signed; More Than Eighty Days of Disputes Come to an End</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 26th] Representatives of the West Coast Longshoremen's Union, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, reached an agreement with management representatives on the evening of the 25th to sign a three-year no-strike contract. The contract will be sent to the union and employers for approval. As of the 26th, the West Coast strike, which has lasted for 86 days, is expected to end next week. A management spokesman predicted that cargo on ships that were not unloaded due to the strike may begin unloading on Monday or Tuesday of next week. However, ships will not resume sailing until agreements are reached with other employers and the other three striking unions. However, it is generally believed that the resolution of the longshoremen's union strike is the key to the problem, and the other three striking groups—the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the independent Firemen's Union, and the Radio Operators Union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations—will inevitably be affected.</p>
<h3>Internal Disputes Over US Air Force Plan Intensify</h3>
<p>Both Houses of Congress Will Propose Plans</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The internal struggle between the Department of Defense and Democratic congressmen over the establishment of a 70-group Air Force seems likely to become public on the 26th. Senator Tydings, who aspires to chair the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated that he will propose a bill to create a five-year Air Force expansion plan. Representative Vinson, who will become Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, also intends to propose a similar plan. However, if President Truman insists that defense spending be limited to $15 billion, the 70-group Air Force plan may come to nothing.</p>
<h3>Five Major Japanese Political Parties to Request that the Allied Powers Conclude a Peace Treaty with Japan as Soon as Possible; Yoshida Visits MacArthur to Discuss Dissolving the Diet</h3>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida visited MacArthur's headquarters again at 6:00 PM on the 26th. It is generally believed that it must be related to the dissolution of the Diet. Members of the Social Democratic and other parties are closely watching the outcome, as if MacArthur expresses disapproval of dissolving the Diet using Article 7 of the Japanese Constitution, the Yoshida Cabinet will have no choice but to resign en masse.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru met with MacArthur at 4:00 PM this afternoon, presumably regarding matters related to the amendment of the Civil Service Law. Yoshida believes that the Diet should be dissolved after the Civil Service Law is amended. Yoshida's visit came before opposition leaders were scheduled to meet with Brigadier General Whitney, head of the Allied Military Government Group in Japan, tonight. Opposition leaders are expected to discuss the same issue with Whitney.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Due to a proposal from the Socialist Party, the opposition parties in the Japanese House of Representatives jointly submitted a provisional motion today opposing the government's convening of an emergency session of the House of Councillors to discuss the supplementary budget bill. As a result, the House of Representatives passed the opposition bill by an overwhelming majority.</p>

<h3>Numerous Suggestions for the Holy Land Issue; Submitted to a Subcommittee for Consideration; British and American Views Still Differ Greatly</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The UN Political Committee decided to establish a subcommittee to review the various proposals submitted by various countries regarding the Palestinian issue. The subcommittee will work with the UN Secretariat to create comparative tables, pointing out the advantages of each proposal, in order to facilitate future discussions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] The spokesperson for the Arab bloc, Syrian representative Khoury, moved in the UN Political Committee today to abolish the State of Israel and create a Palestinian state controlled by Arabs. However, the failure of this move can be predicted. Khoury made this proposal while the United States reiterated its opposition to directly passing the Bernadotte Plan, as British and American opinions still differ greatly on the handling of the Holy Land issue. The United States has asked the Political Committee to reject the important parts of the British-proposed solution to the Palestine issue and accept the more relaxed US amendment.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] UN Acting Mediator for Palestine, Bunche, requested on the 25th that the United Nations supervise any direct peace negotiations between the Arabs and Jews. Bunche told the 58-nation Political Committee that if the United Nations withdraws from the Holy Land dispute, allowing the Arabs and Jews to resolve it themselves, the situation will worsen. Bunche's statement sparked heated debate in the committee on the Holy Land issue. The committee has a wide range of suggestions for the Holy Land, but the most important is to put one of the suggestions to a vote, but no decision has been made so far. The committee is scheduled to reconvene on the 26th, at which time it may submit all suggestions to a small committee, as the Political Committee will begin dealing with the Korean and former Italian colonial issues.</p>

The South Irish Parliament is passing a bill to establish the Republic of South Ireland and sever its last ties with the British Empire, but the British government does not view this legislation as placing South Ireland among foreigners.</p>

<h3>Authorities Strictly Enforce Martial Law; Prohibit Strikes and Class Boycotts; Municipal Council Passes Three Measures to Handle Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan, in order to enforce martial law and strictly prohibit strikes and class boycotts, specially held a joint reception for reporters at the Municipal Government at 5:30 PM yesterday to report on the situation. Commander Xuan first delivered a speech, stating that after the national army launched the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the government felt that maintaining social order was an urgent task, and specially announced the emergency martial law order for the Nanjing-Shanghai area. All actions that affect social order are strictly prohibited. Under martial law, it is clear that some of the people's freedoms must be restricted. However, unfortunately, some people in this city cannot understand its significance. After the martial law order was announced, incidents of strikes, slowdowns, and taking "leave" in name but actually going on strike have occurred continuously, disrupting social order and plunging people's hearts into extreme anxiety. After discussing the matter with Mayor Wu, I believe that what the people need most at this time and place is stability, and the government's main responsibility at present is to maintain stability and strictly prevent lurking elements from taking the opportunity to spread rumors and disrupt social order. Therefore, it has been jointly decided that if there are any unruly people who incite unrest here, whether they are workers or people from other walks of life, the headquarters will definitely enforce the law. The martial law order issued by the government clearly states that strikes and class boycotts must be strictly prohibited, and the leaders will be severely punished. At this turbulent time, the government must take into account the living problems of workers, but it must also take into account the maintenance of overall social order, factory production, and social order. When labor and management have disputes, the person in charge of the workers' organization can make a request to the management, but the request must be reasonable. If labor and management cannot coordinate, they can ask the competent authority (i.e., the Social Affairs Bureau) to make a fair mediation. In the future, if the labor party makes demands that are harsh and unreasonable, and the procedures are not followed, it will be a violation of martial law, and the authorities will severely punish the leaders.</p>
<p>I hope that after today's speech is published, all kinds of unrest in the city will disappear, including workers, civil servants, and teachers. It is regrettable that the teachers of municipal and private schools have successively taken "leave" in name but actually boycotted classes. Of course, the lives of teachers are very difficult, but compared with soldiers, they are already several times better. Soldiers are fighting for the country in such difficult circumstances, and I hope that others can emulate them. At this time when the country is suffering from many hardships, the people must tighten their belts, endure hardship, and work hard to overcome difficulties together. No one from any walk of life should make special demands to satisfy themselves.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then reported on the three points of the measures to handle labor disputes passed at yesterday's municipal council meeting: (1) The demands of each labor union must be submitted through the labor union, otherwise the government will not consider them at all. (2) After submitting a demand, the labor union must seek a solution through legal channels, that is, wait for the authorities to mediate, arbitrate, or judge. During this period, no strikes or slowdowns are allowed to occur. If such things occur, the management is allowed to unconditionally dismiss the workers. (3) The authorities will also investigate and deal with the instigators according to the law.</p>
<h3>Matters Concerning the Implementation of Curfew Regulations; Police Bureau Orders Subordinates to Comply</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has formulated matters concerning the implementation of curfew regulations in this city, which have been approved by the Garrison Headquarters. The Police Bureau has ordered its subordinates to comply. The full text is recorded as follows: (1) All military, police, and constitutional personnel performing curfew duties who are wearing uniforms are allowed to pass. As for the plainclothes police of the Police Bureau, they must pass with their service certificate. (2) During the curfew, for vehicles parked in front of public entertainment venues, if they have special passes, their passes should be immediately confiscated and submitted to the Garrison Section of this bureau for transfer to the Garrison Department for approval. (3) For vehicles with special passes, the passengers must match the identity of the special pass before they are allowed to pass. (4) During the curfew, all doctors who hold a license and identity card, or who are traveling by car without a special car pass, are allowed to pass. (5) If there is a medical emergency during the curfew that requires a doctor or to be sent to a hospital, the patient's family must first report to the branch bureau in charge, which will contact them. However, the designated hospital or doctor must have an ambulance or pass. (6) Midwives affiliated with the Health Bureau must wear uniforms, have a delivery bag, and carry their national identity card and service certificate when going out to deliver babies during the curfew. The Health Office will issue a certificate for going out to deliver babies, stating the destination (i.e., the address of the home), which will be verified and released by the military police on duty. (7) Ambulances of hospitals do not need special passes. (8) The working hours of night soil collectors are changed to start every morning at 5:00 after the curfew is lifted and end at 12:00 noon. (9) The working hours of cleaners are changed to 20:30 to 22:30 the day before. (10) The business hours of each vegetable market are from 5:00 AM to 10:00 AM every morning. (11) The slaughter of livestock and wholesale business at each slaughterhouse are changed to 15:00 to 21:00 every day.</p>

It has also been learned that if investigators stamped the shopping vouchers 1, 2, 3, and 4 with rubber stamps during the investigation, these four vouchers will still be valid for shopping in the future and will not be deducted. The above measures have been publicly announced by the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Business Is Slow on the First Day for Silver Shops: Gold Control Bureau Instructs on Business Strategies</h3>
<p>The silver shops in this city resumed business collectively yesterday. Overall, the day's business conditions in various stores showed that apart from the larger stores, the rest of the industry was not as lively as imagined.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the resumption of silver shop operations, the person in charge of the Gold Control Bureau convened a meeting of representatives from the industry association yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to provide earnest instructions for the resumption of business. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The selling price of gold jewelry in each silver shop is stipulated to include the price of gold, labor costs, operating expenses, and profits, and shall not exceed 2,100 yuan per tael. Each silver shop shall hang up a sign with the approved price every day. This rigid regulation is made because if the price in the silver shops is too high, few people will be interested, and it will stimulate the market. (2) The above price for selling gold jewelry is calculated based on a purity of 995 or higher. If it is less than 995, the price should be reduced accordingly. In the past, the purity of gold jewelry in the larger silver shops in this city was indeed very reliable, but recently it has gradually become chaotic again. What is called pure gold is only 990 or 980, or even less. The Central Bank sells gold at full purity. If silver shops sell at reduced purity, it is tantamount to adding another layer of exploitation. (3) The highest labor cost shall not exceed 50% of the Central Bank's gold price. This point is related to the calculation of the selling price of gold jewelry in the first item and cannot be changed. Furthermore, in the past, silver shop labor costs were flexibly regulated, ranging from 50% to 100% depending on the fineness of the manufacturing. In reality, each silver shop calculated it based on the highest standard of 100%. To emphasize facts and avoid opportunistic profiteering, rigid regulations must be added. (4) In the past, due to various concerns, the silver shops did not have detailed records of transaction quantities and prices in their accounts. After this resumption of business, they must comply with the regulations and record each item in their accounts.</p>
<h3>Wedding Just Completed, Groom Imprisoned: Leader of the "Thin Knife Gang" Arrested and Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of June 2nd, Pan Yunlong, a member of the Seventh Inspection Team of the Garrison Headquarters, was riding a three-wheeled vehicle on official business when he passed Xiaoximenkou on Zhonghua Road in the Southern City. Suddenly, the leader of the "Thin Knife Gang," Du Xiaomao, wielding a knife, blocked his path, intending to harm him.

<h3>Mayor Convenes Meeting with School Principals: Four Measures Decided: Private Schools Allowed to Charge One to Three Times More Tuition: Complete Subsidies for Teachers and Staff: Schools Must Resume Classes Immediately, No Later Than Next Monday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To resolve the issue of increased tuition fees for private schools, Mayor Wu convened a meeting of principals from private primary and secondary schools in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than 200 school principals attended. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting and immediately decided on four points: (1) Private schools are allowed to moderately increase tuition fees by one to three times, all of which will be used to subsidize the lives of teachers and staff. (2) Schools that have already collected four times the tuition must proportionally increase their free tuition slots (according to the Bureau of Education's regulations, the number of free slots in each private school must not be less than 20%). (3) All schools are ordered to resume classes today, no later than next Monday. (4) Xiaokuaile is urged to stop scolding private schools.</p>
<p>Hoping Principals Will Conduct Self-Reflection</p>
<p>The atmosphere was tense and agitated during yesterday's meeting, and the discussion lasted for three hours before it was adjourned. First, Mayor Wu clarified that the purpose of today's meeting was to review the facts, investigate responsibilities, and find appropriate solutions. He recounted the Private School Teachers and Staff Association's request to the Municipal Government on the 11th of this month for special rice rations and emergency subsidies, as well as the Municipal Government's handling of the matter, believing that the private schools' unauthorized collection of fees was unreasonable. As a result, a stalemate was created with teachers taking collective leave. Principals should conduct self-reflection on where their responsibilities lie.</p>
<p>The Mayor Raises a String of Questions</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said: The government admits that its leadership has been inadequate and cannot shirk its responsibility. However, was the Private Primary and Secondary School Association too hasty in this unauthorized collection of fees? In principle, if private schools have financial difficulties, the principals should submit a request for resolution to the board of directors. If it cannot be resolved, then they should request assistance from the Municipal Government. May I ask if each school has submitted a request for resolution to the board of directors? What is the attitude of the principals towards the current situation where most teachers in the schools are taking collective leave? Tuition fees are paid in one lump sum. Are schools issuing them to teachers in one lump sum? Are the unpaid funds stored in kind? Principals are requested to conduct self-reflection on each of the above questions in order to resolve the incident.</p>
<p>Principals Complain About Their Difficult Circumstances</p>
<p>After the Mayor's speech, the principals of various schools successively expressed their opinions, explaining the difficult circumstances of the schools. The increase in tuition fees was indeed due to the fact that the teachers' lives were too difficult, and they were unjustly condemned by all walks of life. The schools are willing to use all of the increased tuition fees to subsidize the lives of teachers and staff. For the sake of the students' studies, they are willing to do their best to persuade the teachers and staff of the schools to resume classes immediately. Finally, four solutions were agreed upon as above, and the meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>National Colleges and Universities' Holidays Will Remain According to the Original Academic Calendar</h3>
<p>Some private colleges and universities in this city are planning to increase fees or bring forward the holidays by two weeks due to financial difficulties and the lack of food for students. Decisions had been made previously. As for whether the class times in the national colleges and universities in this city will also be shortened, it has been learned that the principals of Fudan and Jiaotong Universities, Zhang Yi and Wang Zizhu, told reporters: Although national colleges and universities are also affected by price fluctuations and financial shortages, in order to maintain the students' studies, they have decided to hold classes and holidays according to the original academic calendar and do not intend to make any changes.</p>
<p>[Another Report] In order to strengthen the teaching effectiveness of various schools, the Ministry of Education has ordered all universities to require teaching assistants and professors who also hold positions to work at the school for the specified amount of time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Prison Murder Case: Investigation Continues Yesterday: Four Suspects Detained</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) In the bizarre murder case at the Shanghai Prison, the case of guard Jin Ruiliang being burned to death with a hot iron in the prison public toilet, the coffin was opened and the body examined the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the District Prosecutor's Office summoned suspects related to the case for questioning. Prosecutors Cao Hong and Tang Meiqiao questioned Tang Fujun, a staff member of the guard section of the Shanghai Prison, and guards Ding Shoudian, Wang Fuming, Li Fengshan, Jie Fangxing, Jie's wife Zhuang, and others. Gao Yong'an, a judicial staff member from the Tilanqiao Police Bureau, patrol officer Yu Yingkai, and plainclothes police officer Cong Lin went to provide materials. Doctors Wang Yueru and Zhou Defu from Gongji Hospital also appeared in court to testify. According to Tang and others, Jin suddenly suffered a stroke, and a cigarette butt fell on his pants and burned him, causing his death. However, according to the examination, the injury was different from a cigarette burn, and the statements of the various people were contradictory. The prosecutor ordered that Tang, Ding, Wang, and Li be temporarily detained by the Tilanqiao Police Bureau for further investigation. Jie and Zhuang were ordered to return home. The results of the examination at the Changde Road mortuary the day before yesterday are being compiled by Sun Kui, director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine. After the examination results are sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, the investigation will continue.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Decides to Give Preference to Public Servants: Facing Difficulties, Seeking Loans from the National Bank: Wei Wenhan Hosted Reporters Yesterday to Report</h3>
<p>Wei Wenhan, the newly appointed chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, and Secretary-General Shen Dongmei hosted reporters at the China Merchants Bureau on the 6th floor yesterday and reported on the preferential treatment measures for public servants and the current difficulties of the industry. It is said that the industry, in view of the hardships of the lives of officers and soldiers and public servants, in addition to scattered officers and soldiers on business trips, now provides a 40% discount on fares. In addition, it was decided at a meeting of peers on various shipping lines yesterday that public servants themselves can ride ships, with their certification documents, according to the class of cabin they are riding in, with a 20% discount on the fare. Furthermore, because it is difficult to maintain operations, the Shanghai Association is currently applying to the Central Bank for a shipping industry loan of 20 million yuan for turnover. After many contacts, no results have been obtained. It is hoped that the government will quickly approve it so that they can overcome the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Yangmi Certificates in Luwan District: Not Marked with Store Numbers</h3>
<p>Xincheng District Rushes to Complete Procedures Overnight</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Civil Food Allocation Office's designated rice stores for the allocation of rice by population in November originally stipulated that Songshan, Luwan, Hongkou, Jiangwan, and Gaoqiao districts would be the pilot districts. Among them, although the Civil Food Allocation Office had planned well for the Lujiawan district, because the district保方面 did not follow the instructions to mark the rice certificates with the rice store numbers, all of them have been issued, and there is no way to recover them. It is now heard that the Civil Food Allocation Office is deeply regretful. Furthermore, because citizens of the Xincheng district have repeatedly sent letters requesting designated rice stores for allocation, the office also tried to rush to complete the procedures overnight. It has recently been learned that it has been approved to be included in the pilot district.</p>
<h3>North Water and Electricity Company Urges Energy Conservation</h3>
<p>The source of coal in this city is becoming increasingly difficult, and the first to be affected are the power plants in the public utility industry. According to the person in charge of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: Since September, the company has only been able to receive 60% of the approved quota, resulting in the depletion of the accumulated reserve coal for the past three months. In November, according to the actual application amount, more than 11,000 tons of coal are needed (which is also the stipulated quota), but as of today, only 5,000 tons have been received, which is less than half. The amount of electricity generated has therefore been greatly reduced. Therefore, starting on November 11, the company re-scheduled the rotating power outage dates for electricity users and stipulated that all motor use should be stopped during the evening peak load time. Since its implementation, it has been able to cope with it at first, but recently it still feels insufficient. The reason is that: (1) the weather is getting colder, and users are using electric heating for heating; (2) the theft of electric heating is increasing; (3) electricity users cannot comply with the rotating power outage and the peak load power outage time and continue to turn on motors as usual, so they have to pull electricity separately on a temporary basis, which affects a part of the lighting users. Not only do residents feel inconvenienced, but the company's scheduling is also very difficult and cannot be maintained. In addition to considering rigidly stipulating zonal power outages, there is no better way, and it is still hoped that general users will cooperate sincerely, do not use electric heating, and abide by the company's scheduling, so as to overcome this difficult time.</p>
<h3>Fang Li-yun's Murder of Her Husband Case: Court Schedules Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The court heard the case of Fang Li-yun murdering her husband yesterday and scheduled the sentencing for December 1. Fang Li-yun killed her husband Zhang Weimin because he had fallen in love with someone else. On the morning of October 20 this year, at 4:00 AM, while Zhang was sound asleep, Fang attacked him with a kitchen knife. After Zhang's mother discovered it and stopped her, she had already cut his head in several places. After Fang cut Zhang, she also raised a knife to cut her own head, but was stopped by Zhang's mother. The police were called and she was taken to court. During yesterday's hearing, Fang Li-yun confessed to cutting Zhang. She intended to cut off Zhang's limbs or blind him so that his new love would not want to marry Zhang.</p>
<h3>Well-Known Leaders in Shanghai Jointly Launch Reform Movement: Advocate for Thorough Improvement of Military, Political, and Economic Affairs: Have Maintained Contact with American Relations in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to yesterday's Shanghai English-language "Great Beauty Evening News," sources in this city's political circles say that several well-known and authoritative leaders in this city are currently jointly launching a reform movement to save the current crisis. The members of this group include well-known domestic industrialists, businessmen, bankers, newspaper editors, university presidents, technical experts, and professionals. They are more willing to spend time and money to promote this reform movement, but they do not want to reveal their names. After the group was formed, it maintained contact with various American relations in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the group: "We are all of the opinion that although we hope for increased American aid, China must strive for self-help in order to make China worthy of receiving foreign aid." The group's thorough reform plan includes military, economic, and political aspects. In terms of military administration, they believe that the military supply part, in particular, must be thoroughly improved so that war materials can be fairly and uniformly distributed, and the loss of materials and corruption can be eradicated. Therefore, they advocate that there should be foreign advisors and guidance systems above the military supply system. The issue of military pay and benefits also needs to be reformed immediately. The "Do Not Eat Empty Quotas" system must be effectively implemented immediately. If foreign aid is needed, it should still be appealed for. Regarding military staff work, not only should foreign advice be adopted, but it must also be earnestly implemented. Therefore, the existing staff department organization should be reorganized immediately.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, they advocate two points: (1) Strictly divide the scope of private and government industrial and commercial enterprises immediately. (2) There should be a realistic plan to attract foreign investment. Legitimate private enterprises should be given full economic freedom, and the government should immediately withdraw from the scope of various private enterprises that it has now invaded. Regarding foreign investment and trade, they believe that the right of inland river navigation should be immediately granted to foreign shipping companies. Industrial and commercial enterprises in areas not affected by the military, if they receive foreign investment, must be given the most-favored-nation treatment. China must choose which countries should enjoy the most-favored-nation treatment, but China should abandon the academic attitude to study the issue of sovereignty here.</p>
<p>In terms of politics, they strongly advocate a responsible cabinet system, strictly adhering to the constitution to govern, based on law and not decrees. Unless this political system can be effectively implemented, China's future will continue to be bleak.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also said: "We are currently doing our best to promote this reform movement and will never 'sit and wait for death,' because the time for reform and promoting self-help movements is not too late. Currently, our initial work has been to present the reform plan to the government. We will continue to promote this movement until we achieve results."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Circles Jointly Telegraph the US Government, Urging Aid to China is Extremely Urgent, Provide Swift Moral and Material Assistance, So as to Avoid Historical Tragedy in Time</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiguang, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the National Textile Federation, Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the National Federation of Industrial Associations, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Associations, Li Ming, Chairman of the National Banking Association Federation, Qin Runqing, Chairman of the National Money Industry Association Federation, Qian Yongming, Chairman of the National Electrical Industry Association Federation, Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Jiang Yiping, Standing Director of the Shanghai Jinban Teachers' Association, He Yuanming, Standing Director of the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association, Zhu Zhongdao, Standing Director of the Shanghai Medical Association, Feng Youzhen, Standing Director of the Shanghai Journalists Association, and others, jointly telegraphed US President Truman, Vice President Barkley, and Secretary of State Marshall yesterday, urging stronger US aid. The translated gist is as follows:</p>
<p>A Determination to Fight to the End</p>
<p>At this moment of deciding life and death, the people of our country must appeal to Your Excellencies and the people of your country. If you want to avoid this great tragedy in human history in time, where hundreds of millions of peace-loving men and women are forced to be ruled by the Communist dictatorship, then your country must provide assistance without any delay. We guarantee the Chinese National Government's determination to fight to the end. This is not only to maintain our own freedom and independence, but also to prevent the spread of the Communist scourge in Asia. Apart from this, there is no other way to go. How can we obtain freedom and happiness under the command of the Communist Party? What hope will there be in the future? The events in Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Poland have made us no longer have any illusions about the "coalition government" advocated by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Time Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>Once the Communist Party controls our entire country, it will be a signal that the iron curtain surrounds Asia. From then on, there will be no free trade or any possibility of operating any enterprise in the Pacific. It must be understood that the interests of your country, our country, and the world in maintaining peace and stability in the Far East are whole and inseparable. At this time when the terrible darkness is about to come, we cannot stand by and watch. We will seek effective political reform plans in order to overcome difficulties. However, our resources are limited, and time is running out, so we have to appeal to Your Excellencies. With the love of freedom of Your Excellencies and the people of your country, you will surely sympathize and provide assistance, so that quick results can be achieved. Time waits for no one, and Your Excellencies should put this into practice.</p>
<p>Swiftly Adopt Actions to Support Together</p>
<p>In addition, the presidents of public and private universities in this city, Wu Qintai, Zhang Yi, Ling Xianyang, Ou Yuanhuai, Hu Dunfu, Hu Wunyao, Zhu Jingnong, and others, also jointly sent a telegram to US President Truman, Vice President Barkley, and Secretary of State Marshall yesterday. The main idea of the original telegram is as follows: We urge Your Excellencies to pay attention to the fact that our country is fighting a life-and-death battle with the Communist Party to reduce its threat to control Asia. This is related to the interests of your country and the destiny of our country. Your country must quickly make a decision and take action to support it together. Although there have been setbacks in past battles, in the Battle of Xuzhou, our military and civilians spared no effort to sacrifice their lives to repel the Communist army, thus winning this valuable opportunity. With our determination and perseverance, coupled with the friendly and effective assistance of your country, working together, we will surely be able to continue the struggle for a long time. What we are worried about is that your country will not provide assistance in time, and if we suffer another setback, your country's policy and interests in the Far East will inevitably be greatly affected, to the point of being irreversible. We believe that your country will not bear to abandon our government and people at this time, otherwise Asia will be completely controlled by the Communist Party, which is something your country will never want to give up lightly. If Asia is placed under the iron curtain of the Communist Party and ruled by totalitarians, then the countless lives sacrificed by your country in the Pacific War will be in vain.</p>
<p>Position in the Far East Will Be Blockaded</p>
<p>We are also aware of the various shortcomings in our government, which are far more than those known to people abroad. However, this is the only reliable and powerful political institution in the country that is determined not to compromise with the Communist Party. We cannot imagine the consequences of your country abandoning the current government and seeking a so-called "coalition government." The so-called "coalition government" is nothing more than a government commanded by the Communist Party, which will inevitably damage your country's important interests, and your country's position in the Far East will be blockaded and shaken. Therefore, we have to urge your country to decide on a policy and quickly provide our country with moral and material assistance, so that our country can gradually stabilize militarily, economically, and politically, in order to rejuvenate everything and become self-reliant. The timing is urgent, and assistance must be provided before the Communist Party controls our country and Asia, which would be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Two Managers Accused of Hoarding, Ruling of No Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Xilin, manager of Wu Xiji Yarn and Cloth Shop, and Wu Bonian, manager of Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, were previously accused of hoarding and speculation. After investigation by the Special Criminal Court, it was announced yesterday that they would not be prosecuted. The reasons stated in the non-prosecution ruling are briefly as follows: According to the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times, the hoarding of merchants engaged in their own business refers to the purchase and storage of designated items with speculative behavior, or the purchase of non-seasonal banned items, exceeding one-quarter of the annual demand. The so-called speculative behavior must be the storage of items without supplying them to the market as much as possible, or raising prices beyond legal profits, in order to constitute a crime. After investigation, the defendants Wu Xilin and Wu Bonian did not meet the above conditions and were not prosecuted.</p>

<h3>After the Resolution of the Customs Labor Strike, the Transport of Yarn and Cloth to the South Officially Begins</h3>
<p>Although the Executive Yuan has ordered the lifting of the ban on the transport of yarn and cloth to the south of this city, the actual transport has not yet started due to the recent customs go-slow. Yesterday, the customs go-slow came to an end, and the work of transporting yarn and cloth to the south officially began. According to sources concerned: According to statistics, the amount of yarn and cloth transported from this city to the south in the past few years was 25,955 pieces of yarn and 7,077,707 bolts of cloth from January to June of the 36th year. From July to December of the 36th year, there were 43,864 pieces of yarn and 1,115,723 bolts of cloth. In January of the 37th year, there were 65,984 pieces of yarn and 172,682 bolts of cloth. In February of the 37th year, the government took emergency measures and announced a ban on the transport of yarn and cloth to the south, so as to fully supply the needs of this city. In April of the 37th year, the transport to the south was partially opened by the government's order. However, by the end of August, the government strengthened economic control, and the transport to the south was stopped again. It was not until now that the government ordered the lifting of the ban.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Soars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with the official transport of yarn and cloth to the south, the market in this city suddenly turned prosperous, and the Guangdong gang bought Weite Jian, and the yarn shops on this street also absorbed it. In addition, the money supply was overflowing, and people were more excited than ever.</p>
<p>The initial call for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately rose by 700 yuan. After opening, all parties were eager to trade, and they entered as soon as they saw the fee. The market rose again by 1,000 yuan, reaching a high of 14,500 yuan. Later, due to the taking of profits at high prices, it fell back to 13,300 yuan at the close, an increase of 500 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The initial price of 21-count Double Horse yarn jumped by 200 yuan, and the trading was in full swing. It then rose by more than 500 yuan, reaching a high of 10,5600 yuan. Later, due to floating households selling, it fell back to 10,000 yuan at the close, an increase of 200 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 300-400 yuan to 700-800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cloth is Stable and Popular</h3>
<p>Due to the soaring price of yarn, the market for cotton cloth was optimistic, and those who held the goods made special efforts. The Guangdong gang searched and bought a lot on this street.</p>
<p>The asking price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 400 yuan at the beginning. The transaction was smooth, and it rose to 415 yuan with a transaction. Later, due to the lack of actual sales in the door shops and insufficient replenishment, the northern gang sold at high prices due to the inverted price. At the close, it fell back to 395 yuan, a decrease of 15 yuan from the previous day. The final price of Sijunzi Yuan Biji was 390 yuan, also a decrease of 15 yuan. High-end 190 Shilin cloth was sold for 700 yuan, and low-end 635 Ka cloth was sold for yuan, and the transaction was mediocre.</p>
<h3>Amount of Gold Yuan Notes Issued</h3>
<p>The National Bank Denies Exceeding 3 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>It is reported that according to the initial regulations for the issuance of gold yuan notes, there were five denominations of gold yuan notes: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. The 20-yuan gold yuan notes recently issued by the National Bank were not within the scope of the initial issuance of gold yuan notes. Therefore, there are rumors that the amount of gold yuan notes issued has exceeded 3 billion yuan, an increase of 50% compared to the initial total issuance. However, there is still a lack of cash in the market, and the premium phenomenon occurs from time to time. Yesterday, a reporter from the United Credit Bureau specifically inquired about this issue with the person in charge of the Issuing Bureau of the National Bank. It was reported that the issuance of gold yuan notes has exceeded 3 billion yuan, which is completely untrue. The lack of cash is partly affected by the deposit exchange of gold and silver dollars. The issuance of 20-yuan gold yuan notes is to replace the issuance of the originally planned 50-yuan and 100-yuan large-denomination gold yuan notes, so as to avoid stimulating prices. Therefore, these large-denomination gold yuan notes are not easily seen in the market.</p>
<h3>Number of People Exchanging Gold and Silver Increases</h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank and other four national banks opened the cash deposit exchange, the number of applicants was not enthusiastic at the beginning due to the lack of cash. However, the situation suddenly changed from the day before yesterday. Although it was drizzling yesterday, a long line appeared at the exchange offices of each bank. According to those familiar with the details, this is due to the recent rise in the black market for gold and cash, and there are quite a few scalpers among the squeezers.</p>
<p>Also, according to the National Bank's announcement yesterday, on the 25th, 3,391 taels and 7.7 cents of gold were exchanged, 399,177 gold yuan notes were collected, 36,159 silver dollars were exchanged, 361,590 yuan notes were collected, and 7,555,334 gold yuan notes were collected for fixed deposits.</p>
<h3>Rise in Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates suddenly rose. At first, it was about 25.5 yuan. Later, due to the rush of importers who had obtained the quota allocation certificates to settle foreign exchange, the price soared to 27.5 yuan, and then slightly returned to 27 yuan. The transaction volume has also increased to 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>It is Decided Not to Relax the Seventh and Eighth Season Quotas</h3>
<p>The Seventh and Eighth Season quotas of the Wheel Import and Export Management Committee have been announced long ago. However, up to now, industrial and commercial sectors have still requested the Wheel Management Committee to relax the import quotas for these two seasons.</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the committee, it was decided not to relax the Seventh and Eighth Season quotas. In order to increase the import of raw materials or materials by the industrial and commercial sectors, the committee approved the early distribution of the quotas for these two seasons. Moreover, after the implementation of the import and export trade linkage, importers can find ways to import a lot of materials. In the future, the import of materials will only increase and not decrease.</p>
<h3>Silk Soars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of artificial silk was sharp and the people were confident. Due to the soaring prices of yarn and cloth in industries other than the silk industry, merchants were traveling and buying actively in the market. The closing price was unanimously increased.</p>
<p>The closing price of spot goods at Tianqiao Gate No. 120 was 11,000 yuan. The market was not bad at absorbing goods. It immediately rose by 1,000 yuan. After the high price, the supply was still scarce, and Mujie's willingness to buy was still strong, and the asking price rose again by 500 yuan, and the sharp trend was very strong. Guan Yin's retail sales continued to sell, and the market slightly returned to equilibrium. It finally closed at 12,000 yuan, and Dongyang closed at 12,500 yuan, both of which increased by 1,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for raw silk was also popular, with the same trend. The silk weaving industry on this street absorbed goods smoothly, and the supply from the same industry was very scarce. Both spot and futures prices increased by more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The initial spot price of D-grade 7878 uniformity was 13,000 yuan. After opening, it rose all the way, reaching a new high of 15,000 yuan. The initial market for high-quality retail was very quiet, and the asking price was high at the opening. The step-by-step market was high in the middle, and purchases by various gangs were still strong, and the trend did not seem to be inferior. The closing price was unanimously strong.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Arrives in Quantity and Prices Drop, Flour and Edible Oil Slightly Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market is still on a downward trend. Although the weather is rainy, there are still many arrivals. Rice shops' purchases are still sluggish, so it is quite difficult to sell, and prices are depreciating again. The prices in both the north and south markets have fallen. The price of white japonica rice in the southern market is 450 yuan, down 10 yuan. The price of thin indica rice and early indica rice fell by 10 yuan or 15 yuan. The price of early indica rice fell below the 400 yuan mark. The sales of Yin Yuan were sluggish, and the price fell sharply by 30 yuan. The price of white japonica rice in the northern market was 5 yuan lower, and the price of early thin indica rice was also 10 yuan lower. Yesterday's arrivals were 3,728 shi in the southern market and 4,752 shi in the northern market.</p>
<p>The market for flour has slightly risen. Due to the continuous decline in recent days, the price has been low. This street saw the low price and replenished, and the market atmosphere was active, and the price rose. The price of old car flour was 145 yuan, and the price of the Bingchuan delivery was 140 yuan, both rising by 5 yuan. The prices of Hongfeng, Peacock, and other miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by 5-6 yuan. The factory provided bran, and the market declined. The price of large bran was 2 yuan, and the price of small bran was 64 yuan. The factory price of wheat was 185 yuan.</p>
<p>The prices of miscellaneous grains rose and fell. The initial opening price of Hankou Zhadou was stable. Later, due to the high price of bean cake, it turned slightly higher. The closing price was 160 yuan. The price of Pinghu Doudou was a little more than 10 yuan. The appetite of the northern gang for corn was very sluggish, and the market price fell, down 5 yuan. Due to the purchase by liquor shops, the transaction of red sorghum was lively, and the price rose by 5 yuan. Sesame turned firm, adding 10-20 yuan. The price of tea beans for picking green was stable, and the price of peanuts was flat after the initial rise.</p>
<p>The price of edible oil turned slightly higher. Due to the continuous decline in recent days, the price has been low, and the cargo owners strengthened their position, so the early market rose. The factory price of soybean oil was 790 yuan, and later 780 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan. The closing price of raw vegetable oil was 620 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. The original price of raw oil station, Jiangbei Jisheng oil was still 960 yuan, and the price of small cart sesame oil and cooked vegetable oil each rose by 30 yuan. The customer gang continued to purchase bean cake, which rose first and then declined, an increase of 6-7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou City Changes Leaders</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 25th] Mayor Zhou Qiyu, who went to Beijing on official business, returned to Hangzhou for only two days. The old mayor, who had served for three terms and for about 20 years, resigned, and the successor was Ren Xianqun, who had served as the chairman of the Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Committee and is currently the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Materials Utilization Committee. Mr. Qiyu, we have known each other for three years. Mr. Xianqun and I have talked a lot in recent meetings. In the case of Hangzhou people's desire for change, the departure of Mr. Qiyu and the arrival of Mr. Xianqun can be said to be timely.</p>
<p>A Link in the Central Area</p>
<p>Although Hangzhou City is not a municipality directly under the central government, as the City Council requested to change it to a municipality directly under the central government, "Hangzhou City is close to Beijing and Shanghai, and connects to Anhui and Jiangxi. The wheels and rails converge, and the transportation is convenient... Therefore, it forms a link in the central area of the country in terms of economy, and its scenic spots are well known throughout the world." Therefore, the change of a mayor in Hangzhou City must be approved by the central government, and even by the president. The people of Hangzhou City also feel this way. In my three years of friendship with former Mayor Zhou, I felt that Mr. Zhou was very capable. For example, he knew that "Hangzhou relies on one spring for three winters," and the income depends entirely on tourists, so he actively rectified the tourist area, several neat asphalt roads, and renovated the scenic area, preparing for the residence and food of dignitaries. Mr. Zhou once told reporters in mid-February of the 37th year: "Now the currency is depreciating, and everything is difficult to handle. Before the war, the municipal government's annual budget was 3 million yuan, and the monthly recurring expenses were 150,000 yuan, which was more than enough to cope with. Now the numbers are too large, and there is a feeling of losing sight of the other, which is really difficult."</p>
<p>Is the Funding Difficult?</p>
<p>Afterwards, I consulted many financial and economic experts. They said: "Hangzhou is not financially deficient, and there is no need to develop tax sources or increase the burden on the people. As long as the existing tax rules are properly implemented, it can be used inexhaustibly. For example, the land debt tax stipulated in the Principle of People's Livelihood should be increased according to the increase in land value. If the reporters buy it, the government has no financial resources, but it can be rented to civilians, and the rent of the civilians can be used to repay the land benefits of the false reporters. Therefore, the problem lies entirely in the implementation." How could Mr. Qiyu not know this? Because of the familiarity of the personnel, the qualifications are too old. Because the people are familiar and the qualifications are deep, as long as Mayor Zhou makes a phone call, everything can be solved. Also, because Mayor Zhou often consults by phone, some things can be solved by talking to the mayor. There are more people looking for the mayor, and the mayor feels used to it. As long as there are no complaints locally and the central government relies on it, even if the finances are in deficit, the central government and the province can get subsidies, so there is no need to find trouble again.</p>
<p>The Prospect of Hangzhou City</p>
<p>I once talked to Mr. Zhou about the prospect of Hangzhou City. He said: "I hope Hangzhou will become the Hollywood of the East." And he also said that Jiuxi and Eighteen Streams and other places are already prepared. Later, Mr. Bray came to Hangzhou and toured the mountains and rivers with the reporter. He pointed to the stone pier on the mountain in the inner West Lake and said, "Brother Qiyu encouraged the people of Shanghai to build houses on the mountain, but it was abandoned due to the war." Of course, this was at least more than ten years ago. But more than ten years later, in a world that is not peaceful, the needs of the people are different, and the imagination of the people is also different.</p>
<p>Mental Depression</p>
<p>According to my contact with the people of Hangzhou City in the past three years, what the people need is the solution to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. They pay donations and taxes, and they see that what is repaired is the asphalt road and what is sorted out is the scenic spots. The price of rice and firewood is increasing, and there is no consolation in the spirit, which feels very depressed. The reporter once wrote "Hangzhou! Where to Go" when the City Council petitioned to change it to a municipality directly under the central government. It pointed out that Hangzhou should take building a cultural city as an indicator and a cultural city of the people as its purpose. Because what the people need is not only material, but also spiritual food, because spiritual food reflects the needs of the people, so spiritual food is also the opportunity for material food. Therefore, "the name of the municipality directly under the central government does not have to be only for political improvement, but its actual spirit is already incomparably noble." However, "suggestions are up to him to suggest." Although Mr. Chen Xunci, the former director of the Zhejiang Library, sent a letter expressing sympathy, the scholars are still just scholars after all.</p>
<p>Mr. Ren is Frank and Lively</p>
<p>Now, the new mayor, Mr. Ren Xianqun, himself said: "This is the first time to be a local administrative official," so "I will not be surrounded, I will never be partial, I will not compromise with local evil forces, and I will truly serve the people." Although Mr. Ren's contact with the reporter is shallow, under the "try something new", there must be something to do. The reporter talked with Mr. Ren, and he said: "For the administration of Hangzhou, take one step at a time, and I also agree with the construction of a cultural city." Mr. Ren is a frank and lively person, and he has a good reputation in Taiwan and Shanghai in the past. I eagerly hope that he will maintain his past glory, grasp the current demands of the people, and guarantee the future glory of Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Murder Case in Nantong: Shi Guanghua Shot Dead</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nantong 23rd] A bizarre murder case recently occurred in our county. The incident occurred at the abandoned reed field by Qifeng Bridge in the west of the city. There was a sugar-selling woman Wang Guiying from Anhui. She had a younger brother named Chenglin, who followed her brother-in-law Tan Tingguang as a orderly. On the 21st of this month, Wang Guiying was offering sacrifices for her deceased relatives. Wang Heng, a relative, accompanied Shi Guanghua (the deceased) to Wang's house in the city for a feast. At night, after the guests dispersed, Wang invited Shi to live in the house of Ge Songgao, a neighbor, to accompany her to drink. Shi became very drunk. Then he was helped back to Wang's house. As soon as he arrived home, there was a gunshot, and Shi was shot in the head and died. Two armed comrades questioned the matter. Wang's answer was hesitant, so they were taken to the general bureau for trial. The police station has now transferred the case to the district prosecutor's office.</p>

<h3>On Selfishness</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Falseness is a major flaw in human affairs. Russell wrote a collection of skepticism, which clearly stated the principle of "Form opinion on evid-ence". Simply translated, it is nothing more than the three characters "avoid falseness". Although the entire book contains more than 200,000 words, what it repeatedly clarifies is this meaning.</p>
<p>Although this meaning is simple, it is difficult to do. J. Austin said: "Any revelation in human affairs is rarely the complete truth. It always has to be slightly concealed and slightly untrue." It is also sad to say this. Even in the closest relationships such as father and son, husband and wife, it is difficult to achieve complete truth in what they say to each other.</p>
<p>This is especially true for political, educational, and national affairs. When three or two friends gather, after tea and wine, once they involve political affairs, they often say that something must be done this way, and that a certain case should not be done that way; or they say that this will definitely not work, and that will definitely be effective. They talk eloquently, with saliva splashing, and their tone is quite certain, and their expressions are very confident, as if as long as they do so, everything can be solved easily.</p>
<p>In fact, most of these arguments are not due to foolishness, but must be based on selfishness. I have seen that families with many children tend to advocate birth control, while those who have only one child tend to agree to encourage childbirth; the weak often criticize "the weak are the prey of the strong" as cruel, while the strong turn to say that only by "eliminating the weak" can the country be rich and the species be strong. Other examples include domestic industrialists advocating boycotting foreign goods, hoarders opposing high-interest policies, saying that high-interest rates are enough to stimulate rising prices, professional philanthropists persuading people to donate generously and accumulate yin merits, and old upper classes preaching the benefits of honesty to partners and insisting on not cheating, etc. In fact, most of them are based on self-interest, thinking for their own pockets.</p>
<p>But what is strange is that a person who specializes in seeking self-interest is always despised by others. However, the same person, once he becomes a representative, a member of parliament, or an envoy abroad, at this time, it is the norm and aboveboard to strive for self-interest. The national system, voters, and countries he represents are also afraid that he will not value self-interest. The more he can strive for self-interest, the more he can win the reputation of a good representative, a good member of parliament, and a good envoy. If not, if he makes a proposition and takes the rights and interests of the other party as the goal, and regards the interests of the person he represents as unworthy of mention, such a style of work is rarely regarded as mentally ill. Moreover, even the opposing group will be surprised at his ignorance and regard him as incompetent.</p>
<p>I have often thought that the so-called "representative politics" of today is nothing more than gathering experts in self-interest from all walks of life, all industries, all national systems, and all classes together, and each person vigorously states his private opinions, and then compromises to make it a proposal that everyone is dissatisfied and indignant with. In order to make the "private opinions" of the members of parliament become "public opinion", they will deliberately ignore the facts that are unfavorable to themselves, and will not hesitate to cite extensively the arguments that are beneficial to themselves, so as to gain the trust of the public. In this way, wanting them to speak impartially and without selfishness and to be completely true is nothing more than climbing a tree to catch fish. Democracy, such as the United States, its so-called democratic politics, is just like this, how can there be anything else?</p>
<h3>Specialists in Forging Documents</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Even if it's fake, it must be made convincingly genuine. In a meticulously researched film, not only must the rules, regulations, cultural artifacts match the time and space of the background, but even the signing of decrees and official announcements must be replicated with lifelike precision.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, there's just such a veteran "document forger": Griffith Ellis. Employed by Warner Bros., his special task is to reproduce signatures and other documents for various needs on the screen.</p>
<p>Ellis is already seventy-eight years old. While others have long retired, he remains diligently engaged in his unique work. His copying skills are almost indistinguishable from the real thing. He forges letters, manuscripts, memos, retail invoices, loose pages from record books, and various foreign documents. Experts say that some of his works are simply indistinguishable from the originals. His reproductions of the American "Declaration of Independence" and "Bill of Rights" are so exquisite that Warner Bros. ended up donating them to the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>It takes Ellis several hours, even days, to forge a single document. When the cameras are set up, he sits nearby, making sure the forgery is flawless. He has forged the signatures of American celebrities such as Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and even Stalin's signature, and all are so convincing that they could easily be mistaken for the real thing.</p>
<p>Using forged documents and signatures in other contexts is illegal and could disrupt social tranquility. But Ellis is a law-abiding citizen. People often say to him, "It's fortunate that you are an honest person!" Because if he were to engage in criminal activity, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>A Story</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Recently, due to the depreciation of the gold yuan currency, many private primary and secondary schools have successively increased the "second" tuition and miscellaneous fees in order to maintain the livelihood of teachers. Teachers say that our salaries have always been low, and we are suffering from this unprecedented price inflation, which has increased dozens of times, making it impossible to sustain ourselves. On the parents' side, they believe that the gold yuan they paid at the beginning of the semester was also quite valuable, and at that time it could buy several dan of rice. Now, being asked to pay a "second" fee is a bit difficult to comply with. As a result, "strikes" and "leaves of absence" have followed one after another, forming an "unprecedented" and "serious" problem in the education sector.</p>
<p>I don't intend to defend either side. In fact, it's impossible to absolutely say that one side is right and the other is wrong, because this is just a small problem within a larger problem. When the larger problem is not resolved, the smaller problem can only ever remain a problem. Here, I just want to tell a story, a true story.</p>
<p>Let's say there is such a private middle school that is doing quite well, and the teachers' salaries are also quite reasonable. However, reasonable just means being able to make a living. With prices rising rapidly, the school wanted to ensure that the teachers could have peace of mind, so they decided to have a "second" fee collection as well. The notice was posted, and the deadline was clearly specified. The accounting office waited for a large amount of gold yuan to roll in. Unexpectedly, things didn't go as planned. The deadline was approaching, but the accounting office was still deserted. The school was anxious and secretly investigated. It turned out that the students were implementing a "joint refusal to pay," led by the highest class in the school—senior year, and the "mastermind" of the senior year was also uncovered. Therefore, following the ancient saying of "catch the thief, first catch the king," the school immediately signed a "summons" and brought the "offender" to the office, which served as a temporary court.</p>
<p>After questioning, the "offender's" various related circumstances were investigated. When the registration form was opened, perhaps it was a coincidence that made the case handler feel "thorny." It turned out that the "offender's" parent was a current teacher at the school! The news spread extremely quickly, and soon reached the ears of the parent and teacher, forcing this gentleman to feel "shame and anger." He cursed and made a scene in the office, saying that he wouldn't rest until the "offender" was kicked out.</p>
<p>The story has reached its climax here, and the following should be an ending. Unfortunately, the ending of this story is still unknown, and, judging by reason, it can only end inconclusively. One thing that can be added is that this "criminal" also enjoys free treatment because he is a "child of faculty and staff"! This point makes it even more impossible for us to determine the "merit" or "demerit" of this "criminal," because his behavior, from another perspective, is entirely selfless and public-spirited!</p>
<p>After reading this story, what feelings do readers have? Of course, it depends on the readers themselves. Here, I would like to raise a question: Suppose there is a teacher who has two sons (or daughters) studying in middle school. If he supports the collection of the second fee, he himself can get four or five hundred yuan, but he also has to pay four or five hundred yuan for his sons or daughters to pay. He himself still gets nothing. Then, smart readers, should he support the collection of the second tuition fee or should he oppose it?</p>
<h3>The Sensitivity of Animals</h3>
<p>— Bie Qian</p>
<p>In the vast natural world, many animals possess superhuman senses and display amazing sensitivity, making us humans, who are supposed to be the most intelligent of all beings, look up in vain! The dog's sense of smell, the cat's vision... etc., are all well known to us. However, there are many insects and reptiles whose sensory acuity can truly reach a degree that is unbelievable.</p>
<p>There is a kind of fly whose taste organ is particularly sensitive, and it can taste almost truly tasteless flavors. If we humans use a cup of very weak sugar water to test our sense of taste, the maximum limit of perception is one part sugar dissolved in two hundred parts water. If this limit is exceeded, even the most sensitive tongue can only admit that it is a cup of pure plain water. However, if we compare this to the olfactory ability of this fly, it's like a small wizard seeing a great wizard. It can actually taste the sweetness in a solution of one part sugar in forty thousand parts water! Even more astonishing, there is a beautiful butterfly in America. According to multiple experiments by entomologists, it has been proven that its ability to distinguish taste can actually detect the sugar taste in a solution of one part sugar in three hundred thousand parts water.</p>
<p>Bees have the ability to estimate time. If we place food outside at a fixed time every day, the bees will come on time, with no more than five minutes of error, as if they had looked at a clock.</p>
<h3>Lyrics from Haihong Building</h3>
<p>— Xu Shaomeng</p>
<p>Bodhisattva's Crown - On a Painting</p>
<p>Deep, deep, a sweet dream like thick clouds,</p>
<p>Weary weather, and drowsy waking.</p>
<p>Sparse willows, gentle breeze,</p>
<p>The boundless Yangtze River flows on.</p>
<p>A single sail hangs on the Yellow Sea,</p>
<p>Shaking hands in the night of beacon smoke.</p>
<p>Where is Peach Blossom Spring?</p>
<p>I sadly gaze at it within the painting.</p>
<p>Butterfly Loves Flowers - Spring Sentiment</p>
<p>How much spring spirit has been dispelled?</p>
<p>Ten-layered hills, cutting off the Lingbo Road.</p>
<p>A jeweled horse and fragrant carriage roam a well-governed place,</p>
<p>Falling flowers and wind shatter the whispers of secluded birds.</p>
<p>Such beautiful time is difficult to keep for long,</p>
<p>All is affection, and yet always misled by heartlessness!</p>
<p>Rain also falls like silk, clouds also float like catkins,</p>
<p>Exhausted, the thread of longing is woven with machinations.</p>
