<h3>立院續開分組會　總預算案明可審查完畢　民社黨立委即到院報到</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕立法院十日全日舉行分組審查會議，秘密研討政府各部門主管預算。據該院秘書處稱：會議緊張認眞，委員們咸抱「漏夜審查」決心。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕據某立委語記者，依照其個人所作初步統計，旬來離京他往之委員已逾百人，蓋渠等已不能忍受南京之溽暑及國民大會堂中之窒悶，乃於休會前相繼返籍或避著山水之間。記者已於大會堂長廊中發現關於航機班期之布告，然若干委員仍揮汗致力於國家總預算案之審直工作，而不稍懈。</p>

<h3>傅作義述感想</h3>
<p>幹政治不能無敵人</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕傅總司令今午十二時在西郊剿匪總部接見平市記者，對昨日學生遊行發表感想稱：「馬我我不難過，作政治就是犧牲，就不能沒有敵人，林肯，甘地都是例子」。傳氏對七五事件態度除前次所發書面談話外，拒再發表意見。繼傳氏重述其在陸軍節紀念會講詞稱：「這次的戰爭，不是普通的改朝換代和政府的更迭，而是兩種不伺生活方式的　爭，大家如果選擇了民族獨立，民權自由，民生幸福的生活方式，便必須把握大目的，而不必太重視局部現象。」</p>
<h3>平治安當局宣布　嚴格執行戒嚴令</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十日電〕平市治安當局向記者表示，「七月五日東北學生聚衆搗毀市參議會，包圍副總統官邸請願後，即爲奸匪份子所操縱，意在製造慘案，展開其在城市內破壤戡亂剿匪之陣容，肆行擾亂社會秩序之暴行，以致演成東交民巷軍警學生互有傷亡之不幸事件。此項事件演變至今，已證明其自初即爲奸匪份子操縱主使的有計劃之行動，而非單純爲東北流亡學生讀書吃飯之問題。故今日之事件，可斷言其爲奸匪城工部份子在本市展開反抗剿匪戡亂之戰綫」。最後治安當局對於宣布臨時戒嚴之意義稱：「在戒嚴未宣布解除前，當地最高軍事司令官及本市治安當局，必嚴格執行戒嚴法令，以利剿匪戡亂，而維護本市之治安。」。</p>

<h3>美援經濟部份物資　不久可大量運到　軍援運用國防部與美接交涉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕美援款項中原定借貸性質之建設專款六千萬美元，是吾將予核减，嚴家淦與賴普漢曾作會商，然尚無決定，須俟史蒂爾曼完成其調查報告，俾中美雙方再擬以磋商後，始可決定。此外，美援經濟部份第一批第二期物資現已決定一次運出，八月後可大量運到，其中除一部份係急需應用物資外，另一部份則爲工業零件，俾可供我工廠生產，達成自力更生之目的。至軍事部份之一億二千五百萬美元之運用，則正由國防部直接與美方交涉中，其工作與美援運用委會無涉。</p>

<h3>理想與現實</h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>——為失望中的人類進一言——</p>
<p>中國人在失望中，全世界的人也在失望中。戰爭沒有解決世界的問題，勝利也沒有解決我們的問題。戰敗的人民痛苦，戰勝的人民也痛苦，至低限度，是感覺理想無法實現的痛苦。戰時，世人有理想，有希望，大家爲其憧憬著的理想和希望而作戰。戰後，許多理想和希望都沒有實現；人類又安得不失望呢？</p>
<p>人類的失望，固不自今日始。二十世紀之初，人類是充滿著希望的。人類對於進步，對於未來，是有很堅强的信仰的。他們總以爲進步是沒有問題的。發展教育，提倡科學，以人類巳有的智力，加上多少時間，當然可以在不久的將來把人間造成爲天國。第一次世界大戰沒有發生前，人類確是這樣相信著。可是第一次世界大戰之後，人類便開始失望了。對於進步，對於未來，人類巳開始懷疑了。德儒斯賓格爾的「西土沉淪論」，曾流行一時。梁任公的「歐遊心影錄」也曾充分表現歐洲人民的失望。不過，那時候人類的失望似乎還祗是局部的，少數的，似乎只以戰敗國及受戰禍最烈的國家爲然。有些戰勝國及受戰爭影嚮較輕的國家，却有不少人在做著永久和平的美夢。如美國的孤立派，以爲不參加國聯，不過問歐洲的事件，美國便可以永遠太平，享受其繁榮安樂的生活。這些人自然並不失望。可是現在不然了。第二次世界大戰之後，人類的失望竟變成了普遍的，多數的，戰勝國和戰敗國一樣的。戰勝國中最富最强的美國，其人民也在恐懼中，也在失望中，也不再有和平的幻想。一種失望的情緒普遙地可在世界的每一處發現。中國人的失望更甚，這是用不著多說的。</p>
<p>人類的失望，是人類對於文化本身的失望。過去我們都認爲文化可以拯救人類，可使人類進步，可使人類康樂。現在人類之於文化便不免發生　疑，便不免喪失信仰。文化可以拯救人類嗎？失望的心靈會回答說，原子彈是不是文化的最高產品呢？假如原子彈普遍的應用，尚有人類存在的可能嗎？這是很不容易問答的問題。我們曾相信教育，然而教育並沒有解決人類的問題。教育最普及最發達的國家，如德國，結果却怎樣呢？我們曾相信科學，科學也沒有解決人類的問題。原子彈所造成的情境是一個最顯明的例證。我們曾相信道德，曾相信宗教，可是道德和宗教也依然沒解決人類當前的問題。侮一國家都講道德，信宗教，一到戰事發生時，即無所謂道德，無所謂宗教。最近聖地的戰爭，難道也可說是神的意旨嗎？所以美哲諾索洛氏（Northrop）在所著『東西文化之相會』一書上，開始便說：「我們的世界是一個疑謎式的世界。這世界的成就是這世界的榮譽的，即有毀滅這世界的威脅。世界各國民族，其生活程度最高，經濟上提携其人民的能力最大，教育最普及，而道德和宗教又最開明的，其避免戰爭上彼此殘殺的能力反表現得最弱。這有如我們愈文明，便愈沒有維持文明的能力一樣。」在這種情况下，人類不能不對文化失望；對文化失望，也就是對自身失望！人類喪失了所以自救之道，幾巳陷入失望的深淵中了望道將何以自拔呢？</p>
<p>對於失望的人類，作者是有許多話要說的。限於篇幅，僅能提出兩點，爲失望的人類進一言：</p>
<p>第一，我們應知道理想和現實是永遠有距離的，現實是永遠不能完全達到理想的境界的。人類雖永在尋求理想的實現，而理想也永在逐漸實現中，可是理想和現實間的距離總是存在著的，人類總是感覺現實遠不如理想的。這種理想和现實間的距離，一方面固是人類失望的原因，另一方面却也正是人類文化存在的理由。文化的產生，其唯一目標，即在縮短理想和現實間的距離，也即在帮助人類實現其理想。沒有理想，自無文化。有理想，而理想與現實無別，也就是，理想即現實，現實即理想，我們所遭遇的一切似巳無往而非理想，這樣也不必有文化。人類所以有文化的需要，即因爲現實不如理想，即因爲理想和現實間還有距離。文化是人類爲縮短理想和現實間的距離而作的一切努力。這一切努力不是徒勞的，不是白費的。當前的現實，雖依然沒有達乎理想的境界，但這不是我們完全沒有實現我們的理想。我們實現了不少我們的理想。雖過去我們認爲最狂妄的理想，有如「封神榜」上飛天遁地的理想，在某一方式上，現在也算實現了。不過，巳實現的理想，便不復是理想而是現實。對於巳實現的理想，我們是最易忽視，最易忘記的。我們實現了一種理想，隨即另有一種理想，而使我們視巳實現的理想爲非理想。這是人類失望的主因，也就是文化進展的主因。因而當前世界的局勢，固遠不如理想，固足令人失望，惟人類決不應爲此而悲觀。這不是我們悲觀的根據。理想和現實閒的距離，是文化存在的必要條件，也是使人類的努力成爲有意義的必要條件。設這種距離眞的消滅了，試問在一切都是理想的環境下，教育何用？科學何用？道德與宗教又何用？失望的人類茍能注意到這一點，我想他們失望的心情是會大大减輕的。</p>
<p>第二，我們應知道在任何情況下，不能放棄理想。人類的悲劇自然是理想不能實現的悲劇。但自人類的歷史看來，人頗並沒有完全盡忠於其所祟拜的理想，人類並沒有竭力實現其理想，甚而也並沒有眞正相信其理想。例如，最主要的一種理想，是永久和平。可是歷代的政治家，有那幾個是眞正相信永久和平的呢？有那幾個是盡忠於這種理想並且眞爲這種理想而努力的呢？人類的政治，始終大部分是所謂現實的政治。所謂政治家也大部分是現賞主養者，而不是理想主議者。政治家似乎祗以應付現實爲能事！他們大都是實行家，而不是理論家。他們往往缺少理想，或竟沒有理想。在言論上，在文字上，他們或許可以提到理想，但在實際上，在行動上，他們又不知丕覺的總是忽視理想。人類所遭遇的痛苦，可以說太半是由實際的政治家所造成的痛苦。政治家總是因賞際上困難而放棄其理想。雖富有理想的政治家，如美故總統羅斯福，在雅爾達會議上，也畢竟不能不放棄多少他的理想。我們吃了張伯倫綏靖政策的苦，我們也許仍要吃其他政治家現實政治的苦！人類當前的危機，是政治家放棄理想的危機！在美蘇兩大集團的對立中，誰是眞正相信永久和平的政治家呢？你不相信，我不相信，大家都不相信，永久和平自無實現的可能。所以理想之不能實現，不一定是理想本身的過失，而是人類不相信理想，不盡忠於理想，及不爲理想努力的過失！對於理想自己先已表示失望的人類，這一點更是他們所應知道的。</p>
<p>現實不如理想，理想必與現實有距離，這是必然的，是不可避免的。人類自然免不了失望，但決不應因失望而悲觀，更不應放棄理想，不談理想。文化是在失望而不悲觀中進展的！理想也常在無法實現中而終於實現的！只要人類鼓起勇氣，不斷努力，無法實現的理想也必有實現之一日。</p>

<h3>三強對蘇抗議全文公布　聲明有權佔領柏林　重開談判必須先解除封鎖</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕英美法三國政府今夜發表三國政府分別向蘇聯抗議封鎖柏林事照會之內容，指出蘇聯對柏林之陸上封鎖，巳造成極嚴重之國際局勢，並建議由四强進行談判，討諭解除此等封鎖之條件。三强並鄭重聲明，縱有意見上之分歧，亦應以談判或聯合國憲章第卅三條所規定之和平方法加以解決，以符聯合國夥伴之精神。任何佔領强國如企圖對柏林居民實施對鎖，誠屬不可容忍。猶憶前此曾由西方盟國首先佔領之土地，巳有一部份移交蘇聯佔頜，以交換西方盟國參加柏林共管之權，西方盟國決不因恫嚇壓力或其他行動，放棄此等權利，希望蘇聯政府對此不致有何疑義。</p>
<p>三强之照會並重申西方三强早已接受維護柏林西區居民的福利及安全之義務，三强今不得不堅決要求西德與柏林間於六月十八日被蘇當局下令封鎖之交通，立即予以恢復。柏林平民之需要，乃不容吾認者，故交通之充分恢復原狀，實屬刻不容緩，茲因蘇聯頒布交通限制措施，遂使最基本之人權亦遭毀損。</p>
<p>美國之照會與英法之照會大致相同，所不同者曾指出杜魯門總統曾於一九四五年六月十四日直接致函史達林，建議由美國撤退深入德國東部之軍隊，撤至一九四五年原來所議定之界綫，惟災軍經由鐵路公路及航空進入柏林之權，應由蘇方加以保障。史達林於十八日覆社魯門，保證決將採取與該計劃相符之一切行動。美國照會繼日，如果美國對於其自由進入柏林之權利尚有若何疑義，當不致自現由蘇聯佔領之大部份區城內撤退其軍隊。</p>
<h3>史杜邱三巨頭　秘密協定透露　係共佔伯林有力根據</h3>
<p>英照會於述及杜魯門與史達林於一九四五年六月十四日及十六日互易之函件後，復曰，史達林元帥與邱吉爾亦曾交換類似之函件，根據此項諒解，因此原已進抵維斯馬——許威林——魯雄格斯魯斯特——多密資一綫之英第廿一軍，乃撤退至四强議定之英軍佔領區以內，一方面則派遣英軍至柏林担任佔領任務，佔領德國及柏林之協定至此乃告實施。英政府當時對於其自由進入柏林英軍區之權利如有若何疑義，當不致退出現由蘇軍佔領之一部份區域。職是之故，英政府在柏林所享權利之所據，與蘇聯政府完全相同，豈得吾認前者而確認後者。爲使對於此點不致有所誤解起見，英政府不得不鄭重聲明，英國之佔領柏林並自由進入柏林，乃係於德國全面戰敗無條件投降後產生的權利。並由主要盟國締結協定加以證實。英國決不因恫嚇壓力或其他行動而放棄其權利，盼蘇聯政府於此不可稍有疑義，柏林之非爲蘇聯區之一部而爲國際佔領區，即係本於此等諒解而產生。</p>
<h3>基於人道立場　封鎖應開放</h3>
<p>各區司令本於誠意所締結其後復經盟管會加以證實之義務，以及其他使用成習之措施，保證英政府及其他强國有自由進入柏林以履行其佔領國之職責之權，其事實及意義已至爲明晰，任何其他解釋均足以破壤合理的規則及國際間之原則。英國政府今會同美法政府，循蘇聯政府於一九四五年七月之請求，共同負資柏林西區二百四十萬人民之福利。蘇聯當局最近所頒之限制，已使英國及美法政府無從以適當的方式履行其責任。查英國對柏林英軍區居民之福利及安全所負之責任，乃爲人道上之責任，此等居民之中包含無數之婦女見童，其健康及安全有賴於糧食藥品等必需品之繼續輸入柏林。我政府所巳鄭重允諾保陣之此等最基本人權，因此已因交通之限制而岌岌可危。任何佔領强國企岡對柏林居民實施封鎖，誠屬不可容忍。英政府因此不得不堅決要求根據協定而立即恢復西德與柏林間之客貨運輸，柏林平民之需要不能一日或缺，故交通之恢復實爲刻不容緩。英政府維持以上之意見，但仍願本對有關各方均予公允考慮之態度，以解決歧見。英政府決不同意以要挾的方法，處置英蘇政府問關於柏林局勢之歧見。此等歧見應以談判或憲章第卅三條規定之和平方法解決之，職是之故，英政府準備在柏林參加四強佔領當局之討論，以解決因柏林行政問題所引起之任何糾紛，以爲其覓取解決之第一步措施，但恢復西德與柏林英美法區問客貨之移動，應爲進行四强討論之先決條件。</p>

<h3>共產國際情報局發表　譴責南斯拉夫聲明</h3>
<p>— （原載「基督教科學言報」美國新聞處譯）</p>
<p>共產國際情報局，最近發表譴責南斯拉夫的聲明，下面是全文的主要部份，英文譯自捷克眞理報。</p>
<p>（一）共產情報局認爲：最近南斯拉夫領導份子對於外交和內政的主要問題，採取了全然錯誤的政策，違反馬克斯·列寗主義。因此，共產情報局接受布爾雪維克全共聯盟中央委員會的提案，揭發南共中央委員會，特別是狄托·卡臺爾治·吉拉斯·倫柯維克諸同志的錯誤政策。（按卡合爾治係南國副總理，吉拉斯傳係南共宣傳部長，倫柯維克將軍係南國內長）。</p>
<p>（二）共產情報局發現南共的領導當局製造了對蘇聯及其他布爾雪維克全共聯盟國家發生憎恨的政策。低估蘇聯軍事專家的不禮貌政策，南國容許其存在。同時蘇聯軍隊人員受到輕視。蘇聯在南國的私人專家，受到一種特別制度的牽制，他們受到國家機關和安全機關的看管，他們受到監視。同樣的看管和監視曾經加在布爾雪維克全共聯盟駐在共產情報局的代表左丁同志，以及許多蘇聯派駐南斯拉夫的正式代表的身上。</p>
<p>所有這些事實，證明了南共領導份子站在一個不配作共產主義者的立塲上。它們把蘇聯的外交政策和帝國主義的外交政策視爲一體，他們對待蘇聯的態度和對待資產階級國家的態度完全相同。由於南共中委會採取了此項反蘇的政策，他們進行種種誹謗的宣傳，把反革命大本營的托洛斯基主義搬出來，宣傳布爾雪維克全共聯盟國家的「墮落」，宣傳蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯邦的「墮落」。</p>
<p>共產情報局譴資南共領導份子的反蘇思想，認爲此種思想儘可適合於國家主義份子，與馬克斯·列寗主義絕不相容。</p>
<p>（三）在內政方面，南共領袖離棄工人階級的立塲，與馬克斯的階級與階級鬥爭的理論背道而馳。對於資本主義的因素已在南國生長，因而使南國農村的階級鬥爭日益尖銳的種種事實，他們加以吾認。</p>
<p>吾認的由來，是根據一種機會主義的意見。這種意見認爲：從資本主義進展到社會主義的過程中，階級鬥爭並不如馬克斯·列寗主義所昭示的逐漸尖銳化，相反地，却逐漸消失掉，正如同布哈林那種機會主義派所想的一樣。布哈林主義者是主張從資本主義到社會主義的和平進展論者。南斯拉夫的領導份子在農村中推行一種錯誤的政策，漠視農村社會裏的階級差別。對於階級和階級鬥爭，存有一種錯誤的想法，舉世盡知的列寗教義中所謂小型的私人經濟，終會生長成資本主義和資產階級這一點，已被忽略了。</p>
<p>迄今爲止，南國農村的政治情况，使我們再無姑息和忽視的理由。今日南斯拉夫的情况，是私人農村佔著優勢，土地國有化並不存在，土地的成爲私人財產是法律，每個人都可以買賣土地，相當可觀的土地集中在一些富農的手裏，（這些富農反對農業集體化），人民是可以僱用來工作的。在這種種情况下，若要教育和姑息一個企圖蒙蔽階級鬥爭的黨，事實上是不可能的。因爲他們相信：農民是南斯拉夫國家最穩固的基礎，所以在勞工階級的任務的問題上，南共的領導份子已脫離了馬克斯·列寗的路綫，走上國家主義和富農的道路。</p>
<p>列寗曾經教導過我們，普羅列塔利亞是當前社會里唯一的澈底的革命階級，因此必須在一切勞動者的鬥爭裏（被削剝者反抗壓迫者和剝削者的鬥爭裏）作一個領導者，領導一切人民爲一個澈底的，民主的翻身而鬥爭。</p>
<p>南國領袖現正違犯此一馬克斯·列寗主義的教義。</p>

<h3>空軍與電車工人起衝突　英商各路車輛停駛半日　軍警憲漏夜會審　雙方均有受傷肇事責任各執一詞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商各路電車於昨日中午起，全部停駛，以抗議八路電車司機售票兩人被空軍人員毆打受傷。本市軍憲警當局及市社會局等開訊，紛紛派員往匯山路電車公司車廠調解，幾經週折，空軍供應總處處長張偉華對工人方面所提出之懲兇，賠償醫藥費及組織臨時軍事法庭立即查詢肇事兵士等各項要求完全表示接受，至此工人始允將各綫有軌無軌電車恢復行駛，時已下午八時，據公司佔計，在此八小時內所受營業上之損失，達數百億。</p>
<p>行駛於外灘與楊樹浦間之八路電車，於昨晨十一時卅二分第七十一號車駛經兆豐路站時，因車中乘客擁擠，過站未停，適有空軍兩人，在該站等候乘車，於是引起誤會，發生衝突，惟七十一號車仍繼續前駛。不數分鐘八〇二號司機張根寶駕駛八十九號電車接踵駛來，其時站上空軍人員已聚有多人，電車亦續有駛到，雙方遂發生毆打。在該站左近之空軍供應司令部補給總處西倉庫門崗哨兵聞警，特槍趕至出事站頭，將電車人員驅散，混亂中八〇二號司機張根寶及二二八六號售票陳如康，被拉入空軍倉庫中。據事後兩人告記者稱：拉入後即被褫去上衣，且將雙手用繩索反綁，恣意痛毆，八〇二號被足跺拳打之餘，又被數人抬起拋擲，故受傷最重，幸不久黃浦警察分局股員張叔開及公司當局所派來交涉之職員劉松波趕到，始將張陳兩人保出。車送市立第五醫院醫治。</p>
<p>赫德路車廠工友出發赴楊樹浦廠慰問（本報攝）</p>
<h3>紛紛停車抗議　工人情緒激昂　車廂上滿塗標語</h3>
<p>此事發生後，消息瞬即傳遍全廠，各綫外勤人員紛紛將車輛停駛，以示抗議，東大名路，楊樹浦路，浙江路等各處電車列隊停駛，且在車廂上滿塗：「抗議軍人吊打工人」，「國家養兵作什麼？」等標語，路人咸駐足詢問，一時且誤傳已有售票一人已被毆身亡。赫德路廠內外勤工人得訊，亦全體停工嚮應，集體赴匯山路廠慰問，全面停工之勢於焉形成。警備第二大隊隊長嚴滋，提籃橋警分局局長黃雲龍，空軍供應司令部供應總處處長張偉華，社會局調解科科長樊振邦，副科長顧若峯等，先後趕赴匯山路車廠，竭力勸導恢復各綫電車行駛，然工人情緒高張，毫無效果。</p>
<p>空軍供應司令部供應總處張處長當時向集中在廣塲上之司機售票表示決澈查兇手，且謂即使肇事責任不在空軍方面，對於行凶士兵亦要處罰，惟希望即刻恢復電車行駛以維持交通。警備大隊第二隊隊長嚴滋，提籃橋分局長黃雲龍，社會局專員嚴棐賢，狄介先等，亦均再三力勸先行恢復交通，一面留待秉公解決，惟此時工人方面已派代表至醫院探視傷者傷勢，尚未返廠報告，同時工人羣中意見頗爲紛歧，有人要求先交出凶手然後開車，有人要求凶手交出後並須立即開軍事法庭審判，然後開車，工會監事鄭仰大乃請軍警長官暫退至辦公室內休息，俾工人可將意見集中後提出要求。</p>
<p>受傷之售票員陳如康（本報攝）</p>
<h3>工人提四條件當局接受</h3>
<p>於是廣場上工人開始討論，結果提出四項條件：（一）組開臨時軍事法庭，由軍警憲及社會局各長官審判，工人則派代表列席旁聽。（二）受傷者一切損失由打人者責責賠償。（三）懲辦空軍值日主管。（四）請求軍警保證禁止此後非法逮捕工人。如有不合，應送警局或交公司辦理。此項條件提出後，空軍張處長及警備部嚴隊長表示可全部接受，惟應以工人立即復工爲交換條件。但此時工人前往醫院探視傷者之代表尚未歸來，故仍形成僵局。旋提籃橋警局黃分局長携來市立第五醫院傷單，當衆報告：「八〇二號司機張寶根胸及腿部挫傷，二二八六號售票陳如康胸部挫傷，右胸壁有皮下出血」。均無大礙，同時工人代表亦自醬院歸來報告尚無生命危險。工人情緒乃稍見平息，惟因兇手未交出，故仍不肯復工，惟答允先將停在路上之車輛駛進廠中。</p>
<h3>黃昏時分恢復行車</h3>
<p>最後空軍方面。乃將與八〇二號司機衝突而頭部亦受擊傷之機械士劉金宜用警備車送來電車廠，交與警備人員，帶至警備第二大隊隊部，由各方長官會審。嚴隊長並表示決秉公辦理。至此，工人方面認爲滿意，遂推出代表司機王志敬，售票傅維邦，高乃鼎，白文貴等四人，至警備大隊列席旁聽，其餘工人則分頭恢復工作，第一輛電車復駛出廠時，巳鐘鳴八下矣。</p>
<h3>會審情形</h3>
<p>晚九時半起，在第二警備大隊內開始審問，承審者爲第二大隊長嚴滋，大連路憲兵隊長王如黎，提籃橋警副分局長王希文，空軍供應總處長張偉華，社會局調解科副科長顧若峯等，首訊空軍機械士劉金宜，據稱，於十一時半下班回家吃飯，出倉庫時見前面發生吵閙，前往觀看，被八〇二號司機不問情由，用鐵扳手重擊，致頭破血流，乃將該司機拖進廠內，其餘均不知情。繼由工人代表陳述出事情形及八〇二號司機二二八六號售票被拖進倉庫內綑綁毆打之經過，惟因彼等均未目睹，僅係聽自其他司機售票所述，故對於眞相不能確言。復由出事後前住空軍倉庫保出被押司機售票之提籃橋警察局股員張叔開報告，渠證明當時確曾目睹八〇二號司機及二二八六號售票雙手被反綁。空軍人員囑其寫「收到兇手及兇器」之收條後，始予鬆綁交出，車送第五醫院。（按兩傷者後復由電車公司總稽查吳錦榮轉送濟民醫院）。至此會審人員乃嚴詢該倉庫値星官何貽謀及衛兵排長杜定宇，是吾有將工人綑綁或目睹何人將彼等綑綁，供應總處處長並諭以空軍名譽爲車，從實說出，但均稱當時於紊亂中不知其水。會審各官長交換意見後，認為機械士劉金宜本身爲受傷者，發生糾紛時之眞相尚待調查，而何人將工人綑綁，則應查出嚴辦，故最好由受傷之兩工人親述經過情形，並指認凶手。嚴隊長乃派員赴濟民醫院，擬提該兩受傷之司機售票，但院方因兩人傷勢未痊，未允提去。此時巳近午夜，會審各官長因電車公司受傷之當事人未至，眞柑不能明瞭，而工人四代表又無權代表全體工人進行和解，故決定暫停審問，俟今日受傷之兩人到案後，再行指認凶手，以憑核辦。</p>

<h3>太行區集體逼婚　買老扁結褵後演出新閨怨</h3>
<p>〔太原訊〕光天化日，朗朗乾坤，叫人真不相信這是人類社會中發生的事情。這是一件受「法律」保障的「集體强迫婚姻案」，發生在共匪魔爪下的太行區　關縣屬郭堡莊。</p>
<p>賈老扁係郭堡莊一個農民的女兒，今年二十一歲，生得容顏秀麗，姿色可人，久爲共匪各級幹部所垂涎，但因她在十九歲時，巳與口頭村王黑年結婚，婚後又過的相親相愛的生活，故始終未能染指。</p>
<p>鴛鴦別</p>
<p>「土改運動」以後，依「法」貧苦不得與富農子弟結婚。王黑年被戴上了一頂富農帽子，依據「法令」和愛妻賈老扁離婚，於本年二月二十二日，離婚手續在「村政府」辦妥，鴛鴦驟別，肝腸寸斷，一時情不自禁，雙雙放聲大哭，鄉里爲之酸鼻。</p>
<p>離婚後，賈老扁回了郭家堡娘家居住，郭堡莊的共匪爪牙以爲時機成熟，就整天整夜的去「進攻」，說：「咱村武委會副主任賈老迷，和退伍軍人郭海生都是光棍，妳想嫁誰，由妳挑上一個吧」：賈老扁恨在心頭，但不敢過分得罪，於是佯作笑臉說，「我才離了婚不久，過一年再說吧，當下誰也不嫁」。匪徒們嘻皮笑臉儘管糾纏說：「大概妳不願嫁給賈老迷，嫌他長大瘡（楊梅），妳還是嫁給郭海生吧」！賈老扁一概拒絕，後來匪徒們開會討論，決定集中火力，輪流「進攻」，經過三天三夜的「包圍」，她還是不願意，惹惱了共匪指導員賈長法，一拍桌子，怒目橫視，說：「妳和老郭結了婚，啥事也沒有，如果不結的話，妳娘也過不去」！農會主任從旁騙誘：「妳嫁上個年靑人要去當兵，妳還不是守活寡，妳和老郭結了婚，什麼困難也沒有，連妳娘也能照顧了」。成脅利誘，再三强迫，但賈老扁在「寗死不嫁匪幹部」的意志下，堅決不從。</p>
<p>三丈布</p>
<p>不料二十八日那天，買長法帶着兇眉惡眼的五六個流氓，一路叫囂著來到老扁家裏，一進門就說：「妳要多少東西要啥有啥，先給你三丈布，縫些衣服去結婚吧」。賈老扁心下一急，流著淚哀告道：「我啥也不要，請大人們可憐我吧，我暫時不願結婚」。匪徒一聽大怒，齊聲吶喊：「不願意也得願意」！說罷，把三丈布扔下，扭頭就走，臨出門限時說：「明天就得扣你，你這個「大特務」，不看幹部的面子，死不回頭！</p>
<p>恐嚇信</p>
<p>就在這一天的夜裏，買老扁正和她母親相對飲泣的時候，接到一封恐嚇信，上寫：「今天下午區上來信說，你不願和郭海生結婚，今天黑夜就要把你扣到區上」。署名係政治主任賈太喜，送信的人從身上掏出了區上的公事，用力地在手上一拍說：「你看，區上公事上說，你要想通了，就不用今天黑夜去，只是明天結婚就可以」。「民教主任」在旁哼了一聲說：「婚是非結不行」！</p>
<p>第二天早最，匪徒又集合在「合作社」裏開會，商量「全面進攻」，並著郭海生準備了幾十萬元的結婚請客用品。廿九日的三更時分，賈老扁已在熟睡，郭海生即按照原定計劃，將門打開，闖了進去，笑迷迷的對賈老扁說：「咱們明天就去結婚，啥也準備好啦，今兒黑夜就跟我睡吧！」老扁渾身抖作一團，連聲叫媽，用被子將全身矇了起來。郭海生一奔跳上床去，當著老扁母親的面實行姦浮，三個人扭作一團，哭聲，叫聲，呼救聲，交織成一片，四鄰都驚嚇的不知所措，因爲畢竟未能如願，臨走時郭海生對母女飽以拳足。</p>
<p>入洞房</p>
<p>第三天，什麼政治主任，民教主任，農會主席一類匪徒，成羣結隊的到了老扁家裏，申言是「來講道理」。他們說：一你要是不願意和人家結婚，就不該收下布呀！郭海生還化了幾十萬塊錢，你要全部包賠出來，賠不出來，攆你出村」。另一個說：「不賠，今天就渦不去。看你有多大本事，還小看幹部哩？」說完「政治主任」就去打鑼，召集婦女開會，準備賈老扁鬥爭。這時的賈老扁，悲憤交加，假托解手爲辭，在廁所裏上了吊。她母親等了很久不見歸來，待去廁所裏看時，賈老扁已奄奄一息，當即解救下來，幸未致死，只是吐了幾口鮮血。匪徒們聽說老扁尋死，不但不加憐憫，反而更加惱怒，她剛甦醒媧來，就把她拉到「冬學」裏，呌她坦白「爲啥不和郭海生結婚」，並鼓勵一些女流氓們說：「賈老扁破壞了村裏的土地法大綱和紡織運動，大家要把她打個五日不下床。全村婦女逼於淫威，在匪徒們的監視下，用繩子鞋底……沒頭沒腦的亂打，輪流打了四回，打得死去活來，血肉模糊了使秀的眉眼，可憐的賈老扁就在這種忍受不住的摧殘之下，答應了「願意結婚」。當天晚上郭海生在「婦救主任」李果會的家中請「帮忙」過的「同志」們吃了一頓包餃子入了「洞房」　第二天匪徒們狂歡的互祝著說：「大事成功了！」（時代社）</p>

<h3>豫東大捷經過　匪十萬戰鬥兵被殲</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　麗天</p>
<p>〔本報濟南九日航訊〕劉峙總司令與本報記者暢談此次豫東大捷觀感後（見昨日第一版），其副參謀長章毓金復告此役詳細經過如下：</p>
<p>共匪此次以十個縱隊主力廿五萬之衆，由魯西渡黃河時，因被國軍某茶兩强大兵團監視兜擊，未敢蠢動，此時豫西之陳毅匪部，（三），（八），（十），三個縱隊，及趁開封國軍兵力單薄　陷汴垣同時，魯西之匪遂南下策應，國軍爲　滅匪之主力，當即跟踪追勦，於收復聞　後繼續南下，將匪壓迫于黃泛地區，匪因我追勦過緊，反過來於六月廿八日晚起，將我靑年兵團之沈澄年師包團於睢縣西北龍王店附近，將國軍邱清泉兵團包圍於杞縣以西，攻沈師之匪爲（一），（六），三個縱隊，共三六個團，而我沈師僅六個團，匪原擬于二三天內將沈師「吃」後，再會同原攻邱清泉兵團之（三），（八），（十），三縱隊，于「吃」完邱部後，企圖遂行其渡江之迷夢，詎沈師抱苦拚到底精神，匪以人海戰術，火海戰術環攻五盡夜，迄未得逞，其中有某守軍僅一營，匪以三團圍犯一畫夜，被全部解決後第二日，匪另調三團來攻，該營全部壯烈殉職，而堅苦卓絕之沈師于苦守至第六日，於獲得「一拚三」之代價後，幸前來增援之國軍黃百韜孫元良之兵團，分由東西兩端馳至，同時，邱沈等部之向外夾擊，空軍不分盡夜在亳無掩蔽之黃泛區內匪盤踞之處廣泛的作全面轟擊，而尤以天公作美，九日來皆天氣晴朗，未下滴雨，故至七日晚，匪卒不支，分向西南·東北·東南三路逃竄。其中主要的一股，乃逃至魯西南曹縣，及舊潴城附近，國軍正以新增援部隊緊跟追勦，此正如劉總司令所云：不僅粉碎其渡江迷夢，並進而傳其渡河北竄，亦不可能，而一鼓殲滅之。章副參謀長談至此，復作總結稱：此役最大成功，厥在（一）所殲滅之匪十萬餘人，多係戰鬥兵，（二）此次不僅將陳毅主力擊潰，同時劉伯承之主力亦損失大半。（三）由於豫東主戰塲之勝利，兗州支戰塲之圍當不久可解，蘇北向淮陰等處蠢動之匪不難消除，津浦路徐濟段亦不難於最近再度打通，故截至目下止，匪之夏季攻勢，我可謂已粉碎其七成。（四）由此役可見國軍戰鬥意志之堅强，相反的，匪於被擊敗後，即紛紛逃散，其戰鬥紀律隨之瓦解。（五）此役甫開始，國軍首腦部即諱言其嚴重性，故能提高警覺，緊密部署，苦拚到底，卒能獲致戡亂以來最大的勝利。</p>

<h3>七月漲風更形銳利　食米門售近三千萬　麺粉油糧限價均被突破</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米價格自越出二千大關後，關歇數日，昨又突起漲風。北市塲白粳每石二千五百萬元，南市塲白粳每石二千三百萬元，且均係中次米，平均較前日漲起每石一百五十萬元左右。門售價格已迫近三千萬大關。據聞此次漲風陡起原因，由於產地暴漲，無錫白粳每石亦達二千四百萬元。</p>
<p>又訊，食米規定價格，昨自動提高爲二千三百萬元，但由於產地無錫之報價頻升，及業外各物上漲，又謠諑紛紛，人心激騰，塲內祗次秈米按限成交。上白粳塲外價格開二千七百萬元，薄稻羊秈各開二千七百萬，漲三百五十萬。早稻二千五百萬元，　秈二千四百萬元，白元二千六百五十萬，南北市到貨共計四百〇七石。</p>
<h3>限價無法維持</h3>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>昨起限價取銷，恢復自由買賣，價格狂跳。廠方照常供應，本街價提高爲八百二十八萬元，計加八十一萬元，供應數量照舊。市塲交易熱烈，在各物上漲及傳言之刺激下，老車粉衝出九百萬外，爲九百〇五萬元。兵船八百九十萬，各升一百十五至一百三十萬。雜牌粉均有開出，麩皮祗有實進，無賣出。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>價格雖經規定，乍豆爲一一八〇萬，車豆爲一三五〇萬，及其他均有規定，但仍因業外各物之猛漲，按規定之價格又不合成本，致仍無人開出。惟乍豆由各行家供應本街實銷，按照一一八〇萬之限價，共配出約四百包，每戶五包。其他雜糧少數交易，元麥漲三百萬，蠶豆挺一百五十萬，芝蔴未成交，合肥生仁升爲四千六百萬。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>議價提高九百至一千萬。淨生油爲六千九百萬，豆油五千四百萬，生菜油五千二百萬，惟此價尙不合昨日之成本，故仍不能交易。後由油厰聯合供應本街門市需要，配售豆油及生菜油，每戶五担或十担未定，價照限價。塲外價格因業外各物猛升，豆油喊高達六千萬元，吉桶熟菜油五千八百萬，吉桶小車蔴油七千萬有成交，各漲五六百萬。豆餅大有餘開出每戶三百片，價爲五百六十萬元。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫</p>
<p>〔本報無錫十日電〕謠傳大鈔發行，市情益見混亂。各市塲仍擯持乏開，惟塲外黑市瘋狂如脫韁野馬。白粳門售二五〇〇萬，塲外二八〇〇萬，小麥議價二一〇〇萬，麵粉因中農尙在猛購，黑市已臨一〇〇〇萬，豈油六五〇〇萬，棉紗跳至一一四〇〇〇萬之新高峯。</p>

<h3>絲綢喊價再高</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市漲勢未衰，結果仍比上日大二億元弱，一二〇金三馬有光，上午開盤即升至十九億元，一度哄至二十億元。旋因浮多乘高吐售，乃見低回。中午收盤即期價降爲十八億五千萬元，週一期加八千萬元之譜，下午塲外最小降至十八億五千禺元賣出價，最後可升至十九億二千萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市仍漲，各級行情均較上日大二億之左，雙馬牌D字等級有五包成交，價做十九億五千萬元。高零担自十九億至十九億五千萬元均有成交，高級零担最大價廿億〇五千萬元，亦有做開。干經高零担喊價近十五億。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市上揚，華強真絲被面，上午做週一期最大出十億元關外，收市即期降爲九億元，週一期加六千萬元，下午市况略見疲軟。大誠格子璧縐棧單，上午價三百二十萬元，民生四五寸格子呢廠盤四百九十萬元，華錦　在一百四十萬元關內。</p>
<h3>人心興奮逾恒　華股漲勢激劇</h3>
<p>華股昨雖仍有熾烈之漲風，但戒忌倍增，臨收稍回，人心之興奮逾恒，永紗美亞信和華豐開出即吿漲停，餘開股高後，因熱門大股之貼價有求，陸續一一漲停，十時後，再呈滿堂紅。紗布一躍四成，帶好了其他物品，普遍之通貨籌碼，再向股市課出路，有求乏供，正式成交遂吿絕跡。最俏時，永紗加到五百五，美亞再需一成，新光加三元，景福貼一元半，以致十一時左右警部便衣人員，進駐塲內監視，銳氣大减，因而引起種種顧忌式的流言，十一時半後，經二〇五號二一九號一二號六五號等之了結，於是退至漲限有成交，餘股咸降至漲限以下若干迄一成不等，永紗最後仍需貼價二百元，結果除永紗美亞中法華新信誼統益榮豐內衣五和永業商務聯華閘北漲停外，餘均升半成迄一成半不等，塲外各未上市股票，以文化公用紡織最俏，各昻一成强，餘亦　秀。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨　縱趨昂，成交四百餘萬，統內晨開一一三萬，自一〇七萬漲達一二三萬而後稍回，較前收計甲乙漲十萬，統丙昻十六萬元，丁升九萬元，戊種亦好起八萬元。</p>
<h3>行局昨又差出</h3>
<p>昨日銀根仍鬆，外埠匯款來滬頗多，惟現鈔籌碼極形枯竭，四行二局差出二三二四億。內計央行進九三〇億，中國進五四〇六億，交通出五二〇一億，農民出三〇一二億，中信局進三九六億，郵匯局進四三億，合作金庫出八八六億。洋商銀行進七〇八四億，大交換進二九六六億，小交換出七九二六億，暗息仍四角一分。</p>
<h3>食糖昨未開做</h3>
<p>食糖市塲，昨因公會召開理監事臨時緊急會議，商討抑平市價及救濟特捐問題，同時令飭同業必須依照限價交易，不得超出合法利潤，以致買賣雙方無從下手，結果各貨均未做開。</p>
<h3>綠茶止疲轉堅</h3>
<p>專以出口菲洲爲主之珍圖等綠茶，自日前由一般獲利貨主，相率拋售以來，過程頓轉處浮，而昨市一致止疲轉穩，價格方面，雖未遞升，但各露堅態。揆諸原因，毛茶原料，產價一再上升，兼以加工複製之繳用，與日同增，賣戶乃居奇扳守，形勢遂吿轉機。其他花色，中午亦起蠢動，結果一呼百應，多見上揚。惟買方感於一時不易順利吸納，暫懷袖手旁觀態度。</p>
<h3>交易雖稀漲風驚人　紗布創空前高價</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以布價飛騰，環境利買，人心奮發，市盤扶搖直上，惟熱門貨少做開，粗細紗市上供售甚稀，原因爲經警在塲監視仍嚴，行情不能喊高，貨主不願輕脫，而購者則亟謀搜求，市氣乃暗中堅俏。</p>
<p>廿一支雙馬紗甫開即漲破十億大關，步昻至十一億五千萬元結束，猛漲一億九千萬元，星期一出貨照加一億元。二十支金鵝金城週一出十二億，三羊十一億五千萬元。十六支子虎週一出十一億，其他四十二支藍鳳喊十六億，四十支十五億，卅二支銀月十四億，僅有喊價，鮮見成交。嗣至十一點半許，常局恐漲風擴大，即令收緊，最後廿一支雙馬週一出十二億有供售，全日成單二十二張，做開九十六件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因游資活躍，搜購遙湧，散戶拉抬，市氣激昂逾恒。場內軍警管制仍嚴，形呈停頓，塲外暗潮澎湃，喊價紊亂。十二磅龍頭細布及四君子元嗶嘰，曾高至四千萬元，最後三千九百萬，喇叭童細布三千六百萬有成交，其他三九〇美亭士林狂漲一千萬，銀濤漂布亦升七百萬元，藍布元布及斜紋府綢等一致挺秀。</p>

<h3>紗布繳款辦法　國行予以改善</h3>

<h3>末批世運代表團　今離滬出國　總領隊王正廷率領</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國出席第十四屆奧林匹克世界運動會代表團分三批出發，第一二兩批足籃球隊已分別先行出國，最後一批包括黃守義郝更生陸翔千施肇康及田徑選手樓文敖陳英郞等，由總領隊工正廷博士率領，定今晨七時搭中航公司羈王號機離滬赴英，將途經香港昆明，今晚抵仰光，明日飛加爾各答，十三日搭英機離印飛倫敦。今日出國之世運代表團名單如下：</p>
<p>（總領隊）王正廷（總幹事）董守義（總敎練）郝更生（中文秘書）田漢祥（英文秘書）馮成鎭（幹事）施肇康陸翔千（助理幹事）吳志鍋（田徑選手）樓文敖陳英郞</p>
<h3>總領隊王正廷　報名籌備參加經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國世運代表團總領隊工正廷博士，於昨日出國前夕，下午三時假座康樂酒家招待本市各報記者，對中華全國體育協進會籌備參加本屆世運留經過，代表團之組織，及經費籌募等，作詳細之報吿。並稱總敎練馬約翰因身體欠佳，不克出國，已改推顧問郝更生兼任。王氏談話摘要錄次：</p>
<h3>代表團籌組經過</h3>
<p>中華全國體育協進會，接得倫敦第十四屆世界運動會籌備委員會之邀請後，即積極進行籌備，代表團之組織，選手代表之遴選，各種規定，俱根據理監事會議所決定，絕非可隨意變更。體協卅六年一月七日常務理事會推定王氏及馬約翰，容啓兆，宋君復，江良規，許民輝，冀守義等七人組織遴選委員會，並由遴選委員會推定各單項選拔委員會，以選拔參加之選手，復於卅六年十一月二日由體協理監事聯席會議，推定壬氏爲總領隊，黃守義爲總幹事，馬約翰爲總敎練，容啓兆爲足球隊領隊，江良規爲籃球隊領隊，李惠堂爲足球隊指導，宋君復爲籃球隊指導，許民輝爲游泳隊領隊兼指導，馬約翰爲田徑隊領隊兼指導，復於卅七年二月十八日常務理事會通過，聘請鄭天錫大使爲顧問，三十七年五月三日體協常務理事會，除通過中華代表團組織規程外，並聘定郝更生鍾玉亭胡好等三君爲顧問，陳堯聖賴恬昌（中國駐英大使館秘書）兩君爲聯絡員，田漢祥爲中文秘書，馮成鎭爲火文秘書，施肇康陸翔千兩君爲幹事。依照該團組織規程，並由總領隊聘定　家鹿爲管理，吳志鋼爲助理幹事，以協助該團各項事務。至於錢旭滄，顧乾麟，王統元，莊友仁，顧家振等，隨團自費赴會，係根據卅七年五月三日體協常務理事會第六項之決議：「社會熱心體育人士，對於本會經費熱心捐助，而願自費參加世運者，得由總領隊依照上屆成例，聘爲本團隨員，隨團前往」。</p>
<h3>經費募集</h3>
<p>依照國際奧林匹克之定章，係由世界各國業餘運動員所組成，代表由各國之人民體育團體產生，體協會因鑒於參加世運之經費，頗成問題。最初預算爲美金十二萬元，而國庫支絀，政府方面不能有大量之資助，乃由體協理監事會議組織一經費籌募委員會，聘定王氏及孔祥熙，吳鐵城，朱家驊，谷正綱，吳國楨，胡文虎等七人爲委員，分別向各方勸募，一方面呈請政府補助六萬美金，自籌六萬美元，三萬向僑胞勸募，三萬在國內籌募，結果僅蒙政府補助二萬五千美元，不敷甚鉅，此款直至六月廿六日始行領到。至於向各方面社會熱心人士募集之款項，係陸續交來，綜計爲國幣八十四億九千二百萬元正，舉凡籌備期間一切支出，以及選拔訓練之費用，均於募集之款內動支。同時英國在戰後因食糧奇缺，對於各國代表之伙食，大部份均須自備，故該團於四月廿一日，購買糧食等必需品託輪運往。一切收支帳目，於世運結束後，將分別致送政府及捐款諸君，以昭信實。又在國內所募得捐款，均爲法幣，存放銀行，於三月中即申請外匯，迄未獲准，又不能獲買墨中外匯，幸中航機票，一部份允許以法幣付款，此在政府對世運代表團爲一大幫忙。此外郝東生復在南洋募得二萬五千美元。足籃球隊復先行出國，减輕若干負担。世運代表團得以成行，其經濟情形如此。</p>
<h3>希望協助完成使命</h3>
<p>世運代表團以中國人民體育團體之立塲，參加本屆世運會，對於平素熱心體育事業，及對該團捐助款項之社會人士，乃有聘請爲顧問之舉，此項顧問之產生，皆係根據體協卅七年五月三日常務理事會之決議案，所有人選，亦爲社會知名之士，若鍾玉亭，胡好諸君，平素均熱心於體育事業。在此經費困難，人力欠缺之條件下，負責世運中華代表團之籌備工作，自問已煞費苦心，勉盡棉薄，承各方熱心體育人士慨捐經費，以及承國家撥款補助，中國民間體育事業，尙在萌芽，猶賴全國各方，羣策羣力，以岡推進，此次出國參加世逐，對於社會各界之指示周詳，實所深感。</p>
<h3>王正林不獲入選　我世運田徑代表</h3>
<p>中　長　隊王正林前與樓文敖同赴美表演，　樓返國而王仍留美國，當時傳王已獲體協理事長王正廷氏之允許，直接赴英　加世運惟昨據王氏表示，王正林未經田徑選拔委會遴選，當不可能代表我國。嗣郝更生聲明：「當樓王出國赴美時，本人曾與王正廷氏面洽，如二人不及返國，可否特予通融，代表我國，王氏頜首表可，此爲當時實情。惟模已返國，參加全速，獨王留美，並未經合法手續甄選，在美行動，亦多種種傳說，自不能爲我世運選手」云。</p>
<h3>世運代表團機票　中國旅行社代辦</h3>
<p>此次世遝代表團出國，飛機票定座等等，俱委託中國旅行社代辦，據總領隊王正廷博士稱：該社素著信譽，外傳本團購票有回佣一節，絕非事實。</p>
<h3>中華棒球隊　力勝美陸軍　七比五·反敗為勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華棒球隊昨日在跑馬廳美海軍聯賽中，於極度颓勢下，經敎練梁扶初與領隊梅其駒一再激勵，士氣奮發，以七比五力挽狂瀾，擊敗美陸軍，保持第二循環中，與空軍再爭短長之一綫希望。</p>
<p>中華昨賽，因捕手何金本手傷未愈，不得已削足就旗，由鮑觀達勉補遺缺，以致後防毫無聯絡可言，漏洞百出，影響所及，士氣極度低沉，幾遭美軍毒手，幸爲四局調整軍容，起用曹克家，以新陣迎戰，梅領隊梁敎練復竭力嘶聲，爲中華各健兒打氣，始漸呈轉機，更乘美陸軍陣脚散亂之際，傾力進攻，爽戰三小時，卒平反敗局，獲得最後勝利。各局戰績錄下：</p>
<p>又美海軍棒球聯賽，今午續有二塲，一時半空軍戰海軍，四時中菲戰巡邏（由海侖娜代表）中華昨試新陣，成績美滿，今日如無意外，可望再操勝券，茲錄新陣於次：</p>

<h3>紅襪勝空軍</h3>
<p>週二再戰軍聯</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紅襪與空軍之棒球表演補賽，原定今日舉行，後經雙方同意，提前於昨午比賽，紅襪一仍過去鋒鋩，始終佔得上風，第三，七，八局，先後奪得三分，最後一局，投手奧西尼擊出全壘打，結果紅襪以四比〇凈勝。</p>
<p>又今日原有壘球友誼賽二塲，紅機上午鬥熊貓，下午戰西靑，茲以技術方面，發生種種問題，由菲隊建議，將該二賽取消，今日紅襪無戰事，週二再戰軍聯，週三離滬。</p>
<h3>網球聯賽甲組　聯美金蘭大勝</h3>
<p>網球聯賽日前甲組第四幕，金蘭與聯美二隊，各以十五對〇分別擊敗對手，今日第五次賽，計有三塲交鋒，秩序如下：</p>

<h3>契可夫的筆記</h3>
<p>— 霜廬</p>
<p>對於一個偉大作家的愛好者，即使是他的一　半爪，也是足以珍貴的。因此新出的「契可夫筆記」一定爲愛好契可夫的讀者所珍視。即使是門外漢吧，讀之也自有無上的喜悅。</p>
<p>自一八九二年到一九〇四年，正是契可夫聲譽最隆的時候，他留下了一本維記簿。他記下他偶然想到的東西，甚至寫下他小說的大綱，但有許多是他以後不曾寫成小說的。醫如他寫過一個故事綱要：「一個思想激烈的婦人，每夜劃十字，但心底裏充滿着偏見和迷信，她聽人說，只要在夜裏用湯煎死一個黑貓，這人便會快樂。於是她偸了一只貓；想煎它。」對於一個契可夫的讀者，勢必想問：如果契可夫把這寫成小說，他該怎樣寫法？</p>
<p>他又寫過另一個故事的綱要：「鄉村神學院裏一個學生在默記着拉丁文。他每隔半小時，便要跑到樓下的使女臥室裏去，閉着眼，摸她們，捏她們，使女們笑着叫着，這樣胡鬧一回，他再回到樓上去讀書。他把這叫作「消遣」。」</p>
<p>這些筆記也許還不能與近代大作家如紀德，亨利·詹姆士等記事册裏發現的東西相比擬，但我們可以看出，契可夫是自怎樣從平凡的事物和普通的觀察中演成他的故事。</p>
<p>他又寫道：「一個靑年賺了一百萬馬克，躺在這些馬克上，用槍打死了自己。」讀者立刻會領受到一種逼眞的契可夫氣氛。在這些筆記裏，正像在他的書簡中一樣，有時他會一變其嚴肅的客觀態度，說幾句俏皮話，無怪托爾斯泰要稱他爲奇人了。臀如他這樣寫道：「醫學是我的妻子，文學是我的情婦。我厭倦了這一位，使到另一位那裏去過夜。雖然這是不規則的，可並不沉悶，而且她們兩位誰也不因我的不專一而損失了什麽。」</p>
<p>契可夫在他的書簡裏曾把他的寫作態度說得淸淸楚楚：「我的目的是投一石以擊二島：一面是忠實地描寫人生，一面是細示這人生和理想的人生是離得多麼遠。一他又說，一個作家是「應該　一個藥劑師那麼客觀的。……他必需知道一堆毫無用處的土堆在風景中是佔着非常重要的地位，惡的情慾與善的情慾一樣蘊藏在人生中間。」在文學上，這一些契可夫都做到了。</p>
<h3>鄉居</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>因爲我們的學校在楊樹浦底的一個鄉村，整日生活在那邊，簡直好像脫離了塵世，什麽國際上的冷戰，上海物價的波動，要不是藉讀報而略知一二，簡直有似「不知魏晋，遑論秦漢一那樣的莫明其妙，而成爲一個標準的鄕下佬了。然而鄉居眞正的意趣就在這裏，幽靜質樸是鄉村的特色，晨起漫步田問，看鄕人牧牛放羊，心胸爲之一暢；課餘飯後，樹下小休，悠閑恬適；凉風晚送，仰視天體，約朋開談，這生活眞令人響往呢！</p>
<p>還記得幼讀古文觀止的時候，其中不乏描寫風效的文章，老帥就對我們說：一個作者假使能够遍游天下山水，深得所視所聽的意趣，融會貫通，那麼他的筆底行文，一定有雄渾的氣魄，流暢的筆調，幽美的昔韻，工穩的結構，使他人讀來，如同身歷其境一般。」這幾句話在當時聰來，並沒有多大領會，然而當我讀到翁森的「四時讀書樂」後，又能處境在此鄉居讀書，我才深深的體味到古人長者之言不虛了。如云：</p>
<p>「好鳥枝頭亦朋友，落花水面皆文章，讀書之樂樂何如？綠滿窗前草不除。畫長吟罷蟬鳴樹，夜深燼落螢入幃，讀書之樂樂無窮，瑤琴一曲來薰風。昨在庭前葉有聲，籬豆花開蟋蟀鳴，讀書之樂樂陶陶，起弄明月霜天高。坐對韋編燈動壁，高歌夜半雪壓廬，讀書之樂何處尋？數點梅花犬地心。</p>
<p>短短數段，寫盡四季讀書異趣，難怪昇平時代，文人學士，羣喜隱居山野水邊，靜覓此中樂趣。可惜際此多難時代，此種生活，已經不可多得了。</p>
<p>暑假歸來，頓感都市囂煩，記此短文，以誌不忘。</p>
<h3>領帶漫談</h3>
<p>— 依楓</p>
<p>穿西裝的人都與領帶結不解緣。可是，我們很少知道領帶的演變由來。</p>
<p>據說，最先用領帶的鼻祖，是原始時代的野蠻八，他們並不用布或綢製的領帶，却把動物的牙齒和骨圍在頭上，誇示他的狩獵技巧。</p>
<p>領帶的價正創始人，是愛漂亮的路易十四皇帝，他偶然看見一位軍官在他的頸上園了一條白色的絲手帕。他認爲可取，便在幾天內自己也如法泡製起來。</p>
<p>後來，他愈看態佳，便索興給它一個名稱：「克拉凡脫」，並規定它爲軍隊制服中必需有的裝飾品，更特組了一隊「克拉凡脫」御林軍。</p>
<p>一夜，「克拉凡脫」軍與英國軍隊正在作戰，英軍突來夜變，「克拉凡脫」軍在夢中驚醒，急忙把制服穿上。可是，道「克拉凡脫」的頸飾，却很費時間，怎麽辦呢？無法中頓生急智，大家把手中的戒指把「克拉凡脫」在胸前扣住了。於是，在他們回巴黎時，「克拉凡脫」上又多了一個新花樣了。</p>
<p>美法革命後，領帶便正式有了地位，成爲一般美少年的必需裝飾品，他們也開始用各種色彩豔麗的紡織物作爲領帶。</p>
<p>可是，那時的用法很笨拙，他們祗知把結打上，却不知如何除下。因之，每根領帶只能應用一次，到了晚上，就把剪刀把它剪斷。</p>
<p>十九世紀初，開始川「低領」，於是領帶的式樣也改了。有一個時期內，人們愛用傾結。今日，領帶乃發展到它的全盛時期。你跑進百貨商店或各大公司裏，就可以看見五光十色，琳瑯滿目的新穎領帶掛滿在架子上。許多年靑的人們在領帶的選擇和應用上都着實下過一番功夫，以便在情塲上一顯身手。</p>

<p>暑期有二三個月，不能算短。大學生都有一套理想，一串計劃，誰不想在這個暑期裏大幹一番？據說哈佛大學的學生喜歡在暑期裏週游全國，以廣見聞；莫斯科大學的學生喜歡在暑期裏找一個工作，以富經騐；劍橋大學的學生喜歡在暑期裏博覽羣書，以豐學識。我想他們所喜愛的未嘗不是我國大學生所喜愛的。旅行誰個不愛？暑期工作也正是他們所朝夕企求的。博覽群書則完全是他們的宿願。</p>
<p>先不說週辦全國，但說回老家一次，也就頗不容易了。很多四川雲南籍的大學生，眼看着數以千萬計的輪船或飛機票價，不是搖頭嘆息，便是眼中迸火。有些人費了九牛二虎之力，多方籌得了恰够的川資，但突然的「調整」又使他們的努力成了泡影。也有想到其他城市蹓躂蹓躂或到鄕下走動走動的，但火車架又加了百分之八十，且外面客飯要二三十萬一餐，蹓躂蹓躂又是談何容易！再說要找一個署期工作，更是難比登天。今年國立大學的學業生有百分之六十尙乏出路，誰希罕你這個未畢業的？且短期的工作，縱然你有天大的福氣，也不過是家庭敎師之類。有不少的大學生懷了滿腔的熱情，在報上登了難則「待聘」的廣吿，三個月而尙未給「聘」了去的。再說博覽羣書，現在原版書動亂美金四元五元，算來要千餘萬一册，不要說「羣書」，「精」覽「一書」已屬匪易。因此今年這個暑期，看來还是手執蒲扇，白日高限，晚來乘凉，一則養養精神，可以心廣體胖，二則也算符合了「夏日炎炎正好眠」的旨趣。</p>
<h3>戒煙難</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>爲了紙姻天天漲價，甚至一天漲兩次，三次，於是賭氣不抽。—到今朝已經第三天了。但同時却兩天不敢出門，是否躱賴姻債？非也，我抽姻從來現購，並無拖欠的習憤。所以不敢出門也者，蓋深切地信仰老子的一句至理名言：「不見可欲，則其心不亂。」我家裏只有我一個人抽姻，所以在家裏不抽姻，尙不覺得十分難過；但是一出大門呢，紙姻店裏各色綠綠紅紅白白的牌子，都是我的舊雨新知，它們不斷地在向我招呼示意，我立刻對它們不理不睬，似乎太不近人情，而且我對於它們，也簡直不能忘情。更看到人家在大抽而特抽，或許有些朋友再要對我說：「你也何苦！」說不定我又要抽姻了。我深知自己的弱點，所以不敢出門一步。</p>
<p>不抽姻之後，並不饑餓，也不寒冷；但終覺得有些說不出的不自在。讀書少興，作文根本不成功。艱苦的生活中僅有的一點「閒適之趣」，竟也一掃而空。一天到晚，呆呆板板，踽踽凉凉，手足無措，據說一上海楊妹」飯可以不喫，上好的紙烟却不能不抽，姻的偉大即此可見。我輩妄想與姻絕緣，太覺不自量力，簡直自討苦喫。不抽了姻，文章寫不出，稿費當然沒有，也覺得不償失。姻霞供餋未始不是人間的奇福。所以我又要抽烟了。預備去買一種土姻，名字呌「珠關，文雅得很，據說價錢要比紙姻便宜得多。更把老祖母的水姻筒拿出來收拾一番，托在手裏，古趣盎然。假使抽上機筒，文思自然汨汨而流，更博得愛用國貨的美名，一舉兩得，豈不很好？同時還體味到老祖母時代的風味，「閒適之趣」，有過於抽紙姻者也。</p>

<p>據美國統計局發表，美國現有商品推銷員（專門旅行各地，推銷貨物）六十三萬二千六百六十七名，其中女性佔百分之二左右。</p>
<p>全世界最快的「自動扶梯」（如上海大新公司所有的那一種）是在紐約的洛基斐勒大廈，每分鐘能上昇一百二十五英尺。</p>
<h3>黃皮</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>粵東舊諺云「飢食荔枝，飽食黃皮。」南方果實富汁漿者，荔枝最上。他果不能多食，此物獨否，日啖三百顆，殊不爲多，日日飽啖，亦不爲害，功能療飢，其德大矣，故應儕諸離糧，不徒賞其香味之美。荔枝旣盡，黃皮代興。味甘而酸，皮有濃香，能行氣消食。漬以鹽水甘草汁，曝乾可久藏，饜酒肉者嚼數枚，頓覺精神愉快，或用糖漿煮過，味尤足珍，西人嗜之，不亞於糖　。偶檢英美普通字典，不見荔枝一字，而有黃皮，其晉少訛，半津字典註其字源，正取我國之音。東印度亦產此物，而英人用我國方普製此一字，未曉其故。英文字典復有扁桃，亦取兩廣方普製字。扁桃者，似芒果而小，味酸不可口，惟用以炒肉則佳。芒果者，印度語也。</p>
<h3>次韻報錢默存</h3>
<p>— 喬大壯</p>
<p>客舍銀鐙照桁衣，遠游英　是耶非？世傳豪士吳中賦，風送輕裝海上歸。獨立千人原小異，　天六　許低飛，欲從石室釉書去，白首相望事恐違。</p>
<p>此詩於六月二十七日在南京付郵，距喬先生自殺纔六日，恐爲最後一首矣。詩後並有「初試名墨，借紙小劣」八字。——編者</p>
<h3>女儐相的禮服</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>女儐相的禮服往往和新娘的禮服非常相像，據說這一習俗的來源是這樣的：</p>
<p>芳干世紀前，許多人都有一種迷信，認爲一個人到了極伙樂的時候，往往會招魔鬼或妖怪之忌，結果便會樂極生悲，發生不辛的事情。在舉行婚禮的時候使儐相的衣服穿得和新娘相似，就可以瞞過魔鬼或妖怪的眼睛，不幸事件也可以避免了。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>頃見平津報載南訊，「蘇州老翰林曹元弼，八十二歲，經友介紹與封門內年已五十六歲之老小姐結婚。七月四日成合巹　，紅燭銀行，傳爲佳話。信爲空前之美談，比二十四年熊毛之結合尤爲奇妙。彼時熊凰凰（希齡）年六十六，毛女士則三十三，得夫之半。今曹翁大耋之齡，視昔日熊翁「近希之齡」，又超越多多，而此老新娘比熊毛夫人婚時之齡且加二十餘歲，可見時代日新月異，傳奇志異之新聞亦層出不聘。</p>
<p>昔熊毛婚時，紛傳「老翰林」老當益壯，今曹氏亦被稱「老翰林」，他如舊科名之老人，如寓滬之陳小石，寓平已故黃綬經諸氏，亦有多人以「老翰林」稱之。似乎一般誤認「翰林」爲科名譽宿之通稱，而不知「翰林」自有一定之解釋，猶之留學生的學位資格，亦有深懷高低，不能因是歐美歸來，即槪稱爲博七。更須知「翰林院」乃衙門，內設各官，以文學侍從撰作爲職，而「都察院」則司糾察彈刻，亦如現在之五院，各有專務。進士若不人翰林院，即不爲翰林，譬如法學博士若不被選舉入立法院，則不能算是立法委員。如上之比擬，一經尋味，則於「翰林」之所以爲「翰林」，可得淸楚之槪念。。</p>
<p>這位「八二」新郞會翁元弼，乃是乙未枓進士（淸光緒二十一年，興康南海同年），內閣中書，有博雅之名，擅詞章攷據金石版本之學，爲當時名公巨卿所推重。然而他却不會進翰林院，即非翰林。又如陳叟小石，是光緒十二年內戍進士，乙亥舉人（光緒元年），到民國二十四年（乙亥）滿六十年，鄉舉重逢，至前年（民國三十五年丙戍）又會榜軍逢，不但科名作話，且是一人瑞」。然而他由進士用主事，他的衙門是兵部，亦不是翰林。又如曾任農工商部侍郞，署尙書之唐蔚芝（文治），壬辰進士，政治文學地位供優，但中進士後爲戶部主事，亦不是翰林。蔡孑民（元培）亦是壬辰進士（庚寅會試高中，壬辰補應殿試成進士），與唐翁爲同年，蔡翁由進士改庶吉士，進了翰林院，甲午又授機編修，那纔是毫無疑義的老翰林。</p>

<h3>Tense Situation Brewing in Northern Hubei, Decisive Battle Imminent; National Army Withdraws from Fancheng, Fortifies Xiangyang; 10,000 Bandits Annihilated in the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 10th] The situation in Northern Hubei is increasingly tense. Bandits invading Xiangyang and Fancheng have launched relentless all-out attacks for days. Due to strategic considerations, the National Army, having previously abandoned Guanghua and Laohekou, also withdrew from Fancheng last night and is now concentrating forces in Xiangyang, preparing for a bloody battle with the bandits in coordination with the Air Force. Powerful reinforcements from the National Army are rapidly advancing towards Xiangyang, and a decisive battle is expected within days. According to reports, the bandit forces involved in this invasion are of diverse affiliations, including not only the units led by Kong Congzhou, but also the 10th and 12th Columns of Liu Bocheng's forces, as well as a part of the Jianghan Independent Brigade, totaling 20,000 to 30,000 men.

Sources indicate that the defending forces in Xiangyang are sufficiently strong to withstand the bandit offensive, and reinforcements from various units of the National Army are expected to arrive soon, potentially leading to another major decisive battle in Northern Hubei after the one in Eastern Henan. Due to the agility and activity of our Air Force, the bandit forces dare not move during daylight hours and remain completely hidden in valleys and forests. On the 10th, our forces dispatched multiple batches of aircraft to patrol the airspace above the battlefield, maintaining close contact with the National Army defending Xiangfan and destroying bandit fortifications in Wanshan, Jianshan, Bianshan, Daling, Zhangjiazhuang, and Luojiawan, killing over 300 bandits.</p>

Regarding participation in local governments, the party may, in principle, accept invitations from the government to have party members participate in provincial government committees, but Zhang Junmai strongly opposes assuming actual responsibilities below the provincial level, believing that it would be difficult to achieve results. When Zhang Qun met with representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in Shanghai last month, he discussed the possibility of party members of the two parties serving as mayors, but it is difficult to predict how this will develop in the future.

They stated that yesterday's student actions went beyond the scope and specifically involved the highest authorities in North China, and the situation was indeed serious. However, after inquiring with students from various schools in the Northeast, they learned that the Northeastern students went to mourn the dead students, and the subsequent development into a march was beyond their expectations. The representatives solemnly declared that the Northeast and North China were interdependent, and the fact that students from the Northeast came to Beiping amidst the chaos of war was an expression of their love and trust in Commander-in-Chief Fu. They then presented two requests to Fu: (1) Who fired the shots in the unfortunate July 5th incident? Who ordered the shooting? Please thoroughly investigate and publicize the findings to clarify the truth and appease the students' emotions. (2) The Ministry of Education issued orders to establish temporary universities and temporary middle schools in Beiping, but preparations have been slow. Please assist Commander-in-Chief Fu in finding school buildings so that Northeastern students in Beiping have a place to live and study. Fu promised to handle the first request cautiously and to do his best to assist with the second request.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 10th] Li Zongren hosted a banquet for some professors from various universities in Beiping tonight. It is also learned that the professors will express their views on the July 5th incident and are currently collecting signatures.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Tian Peilin stated: The Central Government has no opinion on the "July 5th" incident and requests that Fu Zuoyi handle it entirely at his discretion.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Expresses Thoughts</h3>
<p>One Cannot Be Without Enemies in Politics</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 10th] Commander-in-Chief Fu met with reporters from Beiping City at the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the Western Suburbs at noon today and expressed his thoughts on yesterday's student march, saying: "I am not sad, because politics is about sacrifice, and one cannot be without enemies. Lincoln and Gandhi are examples." Fu declined to comment further on the July 5th incident, other than the written statement he issued previously. Fu then reiterated his remarks at the Army Day Commemoration Meeting, saying: "This war is not an ordinary change of dynasty or government, but a struggle between two different ways of life. If everyone chooses a way of life with national independence, civil rights, freedom, and people's happiness, they must grasp the overall goal and not pay too much attention to local phenomena."</p>
<h3>Beiping Security Authorities Announce Strict Enforcement of Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Beiping City security authorities told reporters, "After the Northeastern students gathered and destroyed the City Council and surrounded the Vice President's residence to petition on July 5th, they were manipulated by treacherous bandits, intending to create a tragedy, disrupt the anti-rebellion and bandit suppression efforts in the city, and carry out acts of violence to disturb social order, which led to the unfortunate incident in which military police and students were injured in Dongjiaominxiang. The evolution of this incident to date has proven that it was a planned action from the beginning, manipulated and instigated by treacherous bandits, and not simply a matter of Northeastern refugee students seeking education and food. Therefore, today's incident can be said to be a battle launched by treacherous bandits in the city to resist bandit suppression and anti-rebellion efforts." Finally, the security authorities stated the meaning of declaring temporary martial law: "Before martial law is lifted, the local highest military commander and the city's security authorities will strictly enforce martial law to facilitate bandit suppression and anti-rebellion efforts and to maintain the city's security."</p>
<h3>French Troops Harass Yunnan Border; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th] News Bureau of the Executive Yuan reports: It has been reported that the Yunnan border has been repeatedly harassed by French troops.

<h3>Supervisory Yuan Raises Issue of Legal Proposals; President Convenes Meeting of Three Yuan Presidents; Result is to Refer it to the Grand Justices for Interpretation; Yu Youren to Convene Meeting of All Yuan Members Today to Report on Progress</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th] The Supervisory Yuan, because its legal proposals to the Legislative Yuan were not resolved, decided to request the President to convene a meeting of the presidents of the relevant Yuans to resolve the issue in accordance with Article 44 of the Constitution. The President convened a meeting of Legislative, Supervisory, and Judicial Yuan Presidents Sun Ke, Yu Youren, and Wang Chonghui at the Presidential Palace at 11:00 AM on the 10th. Secretary-General Wu Dingchang was also present. The result of the discussion was that the issue of the Supervisory Yuan's legal proposals needed to be resolved by the relationship-making warfare center case before it could be bought. The complexity of the procedure was excessive compared to the interpretation of the Grand Justices, so the case was handled appropriately by referring it to the Grand Justices for interpretation. The discussion today was based on the following information: (1) The Supervisory Yuan's opinion, including the facts and reasons for submitting legal proposals to the Legislative Yuan, (3) The Judicial Yuan's opinion, (4) The annotations of the Presidential Palace Secretary-General.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th] The President invited the presidents, vice presidents, and secretaries-general of the Five Yuans to a reunion banquet at Huangpu Road at 12:00 PM on the 10th. It is learned that those attending the banquet included Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui 5, Zhang Boling, Weng Wenhao, Shi Zhiquan, Jia Jingde, Wang Yunwu, and Li Weiguo.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th] The Supervisory Yuan convened one discussion meeting after the recess. Since the President's convocation of a meeting of the three Yuan presidents to discuss the Supervisory Yuan's power to propose legislation is related to the implementation of the Grand Justices' right of consent, Yu Youren will convene a discussion meeting of all Yuan members at 9:00 AM on the 11th to report on the progress of the meeting. It is learned that if the issue of the right to propose legislation must await the interpretation of the Grand Justices, then the meeting must be reconvened immediately to first exercise the right of consent, so that the Judicial Yuan can be formally established. Only after the Grand Justices' interpretation can it proceed through normal channels, otherwise it will not be possible to resolve the issue.</p>

The Yuan was officially established in January of the nineteenth year, totaling twenty years to date. During this time, the work was carried out under the instructions of the Central Government, with the cooperation of various Yuan, ministries, and committees, and with the assistance of colleagues. During the difficult period for the nation, we adhered to the teachings of the Founding Father, devoted ourselves to integrity, prudence, law-abidingness, and public service, and cultivated lofty ideals and tranquility to achieve far-sightedness, in order to live up to the appointment. Although I have resigned more than ten times, requesting the selection of virtuous and capable individuals, this has not been permitted. Now, the Constitution is being implemented, and a new era is being ushered in. Our President appointed Mr. Zhang Boling as the first President of the Examination Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution. Mr. Zhang is a renowned educator in the country, and his morals, scholarship, and achievements are recognized throughout the country. Future construction will inevitably achieve great accomplishments. Chuanxian, with a pleasant mood, hands over all government and administrative affairs. I respectfully wish the examination and selection system to develop, and I wish all colleagues, under the instructions and leadership of President Zhang Boling, to assist in the work, so that our Founding Father's teachings of nurturing talent with proper guidance, encouraging talent with appropriate methods, and employing talent effectively can be fully realized, honoring the virtues of our ancestors and inspiring future generations, establishing a solid foundation for the examination and selection administration of the Republic of China, and opening a new era of peace for China.

<h3>Ideals and Reality</h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>——A Word for Mankind in Disappointment——</p>
<p>The Chinese are in disappointment, and the people of the whole world are also in disappointment. War has not solved the problems of the world, and victory has not solved our problems. The defeated people suffer, and the victorious people also suffer, at the very least, from the pain of feeling that ideals cannot be realized. During the war, people had ideals and hopes, and everyone fought for the ideals and hopes they yearned for. After the war, many ideals and hopes have not been realized; how can humanity not be disappointed?</p>
<p>Humanity's disappointment, of course, did not begin today. At the beginning of the twentieth century, humanity was full of hope. Mankind had a very strong belief in progress and in the future. They always thought that progress was not a problem. With the development of education and the promotion of science, with the intelligence that mankind already possessed, plus a certain amount of time, it would certainly be possible to turn the human world into a paradise in the near future. Before World War I, humanity certainly believed this. However, after World War I, humanity began to be disappointed. Humanity began to doubt progress and the future. The German philosopher Spengler's "The Decline of the West" was popular for a time. Liang Rengong's "Impressions of a Trip to Europe" also fully expressed the disappointment of the European people. However, at that time, humanity's disappointment seemed to be only partial, and only a minority, and seemed to be limited to the defeated countries and the countries most affected by the war. Some of the victorious countries and countries less affected by the war had many people dreaming of permanent peace. For example, the isolationists in the United States believed that by not joining the League of Nations and not interfering in European affairs, the United States could be forever at peace and enjoy its prosperous and happy life. These people were naturally not disappointed. But that is not the case now. After World War II, humanity's disappointment has become universal, affecting the majority of people, and the victorious countries are the same as the defeated countries. The richest and strongest of the victorious countries, the United States, is also in fear, also in disappointment, and no longer has illusions of peace. A sense of disappointment can be found universally in every part of the world. The disappointment of the Chinese is even greater, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Humanity's disappointment is disappointment with culture itself. In the past, we all believed that culture could save humanity, that it could make humanity progress, and that it could make humanity happy. Now, humanity cannot help but be skeptical of culture, and cannot help but lose faith. Can culture save humanity? A disappointed soul would answer, isn't the atomic bomb the highest product of culture? If the atomic bomb is used universally, is there still a possibility of human existence? This is a very difficult question to answer. We once believed in education, but education has not solved the problems of humanity. What was the result of the country with the most universal and developed education, such as Germany? We once believed in science, but science has not solved the problems of humanity. The situation created by the atomic bomb is the most obvious example. We once believed in morality, and we once believed in religion, but morality and religion have still not solved the current problems of humanity. Every country speaks of morality and believes in religion, but when war breaks out, there is no such thing as morality, and no such thing as religion. Can the recent war in the Holy Land also be said to be the will of God? Therefore, the American philosopher Northrop, in his book "The Meeting of East and West," begins by saying: "Our world is a mysterious world. The achievements of this world are the glory of this world, and there is a threat to destroy this world. The nations of the world with the highest standard of living, the greatest ability to economically support their people, the most universal education, and the most enlightened morality and religion have demonstrated the weakest ability to avoid killing each other in war. It is as if the more civilized we are, the less ability we have to maintain civilization." In this situation, humanity cannot but be disappointed in culture; to be disappointed in culture is to be disappointed in oneself! Humanity has lost the way to save itself, and is almost trapped in the abyss of despair. How can one extricate oneself from this abyss?</p>
<p>The author has many words to say to disappointed humanity. Due to space limitations, I can only offer two points, as a word of advice for disappointed humanity:</p>
<p>First, we should know that there is always a distance between ideals and reality, and reality can never fully reach the realm of ideals. Although humanity is always seeking the realization of ideals, and ideals are always gradually being realized, the distance between ideals and reality always exists, and humanity always feels that reality is far inferior to ideals. This distance between ideals and reality, on the one hand, is the reason for humanity's disappointment, but on the other hand, it is precisely the reason for the existence of culture. The sole goal of the creation of culture is to shorten the distance between ideals and reality, and to help humanity realize its ideals. Without ideals, there is naturally no culture. If there are ideals, but ideals are no different from reality, that is, ideals are reality, and reality is ideals, everything we encounter seems to be nothing but ideal, then there is no need for culture. The reason why humanity needs culture is because reality is not as good as ideals, because there is still a distance between ideals and reality. Culture is all the efforts that humanity makes to shorten the distance between ideals and reality. These efforts are not in vain, they are not wasted. Although the current reality still has not reached the realm of ideals, this does not mean that we have not realized our ideals at all. We have realized many of our ideals. Even the ideals that we thought were the most extravagant in the past, such as the ideals of flying through the sky and escaping through the earth in the "Investiture of the Gods," can be said to have been realized in some way now. However, ideals that have been realized are no longer ideals, but reality. We are most likely to ignore and forget ideals that have been realized. We realize one kind of ideal, and immediately there is another kind of ideal, which makes us regard the ideals that have been realized as non-ideals. This is the main reason for humanity's disappointment, and it is also the main reason for cultural progress. Therefore, although the current world situation is far from ideal, and is indeed disappointing, humanity should never be pessimistic because of this. This is not the basis for our pessimism. The distance between ideals and reality is a necessary condition for the existence of culture, and it is also a necessary condition for making humanity's efforts meaningful. Suppose this distance really disappeared, what would be the use of education in an environment where everything is ideal? What is the use of science? What is the use of morality and religion? If disappointed humanity can pay attention to this point, I think their disappointed mood will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Second, we should know that we must not abandon ideals under any circumstances. The tragedy of humanity is naturally the tragedy of ideals that cannot be realized. But from the perspective of human history, people have not completely been loyal to the ideals they worship, and humanity has not tried its best to realize its ideals, and has not even truly believed in its ideals. For example, the most important ideal is permanent peace. But how many politicians of the past have truly believed in permanent peace? How many have been loyal to this ideal and truly worked for this ideal? Human politics has always been mostly so-called realistic politics. The so-called politicians are also mostly realists, not idealists. Politicians seem to be capable only of dealing with reality! They are mostly practitioners, not theorists. They often lack ideals, or even have no ideals. In words and in writing, they may mention ideals, but in reality and in action, they always unconsciously ignore ideals. The pain that humanity has encountered can be said to be mostly the pain caused by practical politicians. Politicians always abandon their ideals because of practical difficulties. Even politicians with rich ideals, such as former US President Roosevelt, could not help but abandon some of his ideals at the Yalta Conference. We have suffered from Chamberlain's appeasement policy, and we may still suffer from the realistic politics of other politicians! The current crisis of humanity is the crisis of politicians abandoning ideals! In the confrontation between the two major blocs of the United States and the Soviet Union, who is a politician who truly believes in permanent peace? If you don't believe it, I don't believe it, and everyone doesn't believe it, permanent peace will naturally not be possible. Therefore, the reason why ideals cannot be realized is not necessarily the fault of the ideals themselves, but the fault of humanity not believing in ideals, not being loyal to ideals, and not working for ideals! Humanity, which has already expressed disappointment in ideals, should especially know this.</p>
<p>It is inevitable and unavoidable that reality is not as good as ideals, and that ideals must be different from reality. Humanity will naturally be disappointed, but it should never be pessimistic because of disappointment, and it should not abandon ideals or stop talking about ideals. Culture progresses in disappointment without pessimism! Ideals are often realized in the midst of being impossible to realize! As long as humanity musters the courage and continues to work hard, the ideals that cannot be realized will surely be realized one day.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Assemblymen Argue with Deputy Director of the Finance Department Over NT Dollar Adjustment: Qiu Bincun Says Issuance Will Never Be Expanded</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taipei, Our Newspaper, 10th] The Provincial Assembly held a full-day session today for the financial report and inquiries, presented by Qiu Bincun, Deputy Director of the Finance Department. He first pointed out that due to the overdue payment of public land rent and the surplus of public enterprises in the 36th year, the provincial finances had a deficit of more than 950 million yuan, and the budget for the first half of the 37th year was more than 10.7 billion yuan. After the report, Lü Yongkai, Lin Weigong, He Yi, Huang Liandeng, Yang Tao, and Su Weilang successively raised questions, repeatedly arguing for four hours about the NT dollar adjustment. Although the assemblymen stated that they did not oppose the principle of NT dollar adjustment, they expressed deep dissatisfaction with the impact on the province's export industry. They also criticized that the NT dollar adjustment still could not control the price of gold and US dollars, and expressed doubts about the amount of the joint currency issuance. In response, Qiu stated that the NT dollar adjustment was the only means to stabilize the lives of the people of Taiwan, although it may affect the export industry, the central government has exchange settlement methods to help. The reason for still losing control over gold and US dollars is that the adjustment rate is not enough. Although the joint currency issuance has increased monthly, it is absolutely in line with the needs of the province's economic construction and will never be expanded. Qiu also stated that the standard for the NT dollar is not the gold standard, nor the silver standard, but purely based on the province's production. If increased production is expected, the value of the NT dollar will increase rather than decrease.</p>

<h3>Hefei Repairs City Defense Works: Funding Issues Cause Storm; Deputy Speaker of Provincial Assembly Actually Paraded by Crowd</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hefei, Our Newspaper, 10th] A local crowd paraded Tao Ruocun, Deputy Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, in Hefei today due to the construction of city defense works. As the military situation in Central China is becoming increasingly tense, the military authorities are adding to the construction of city defenses, with an estimated cost of 100 billion. Tao Ruocun suggested that the local area be responsible for 40 billion and that banks in the urban area split 30 billion. Local figures believe that since Hefei is already the provincial capital, this burden should be borne from the special donation for self-defense, but the Audit Committee established by the Provincial Assembly to manage the use of the special donation for self-defense did not approve it. In the morning, local figures held a meeting to request funds for purchasing materials, attended by 200 people, who publicly invited Tao to be the chairman. The crowd unanimously advocated that the Audit Committee approve the use of the special donation for self-defense, but Tao firmly refused, leading to public outrage. The crowd paraded Tao from the Provincial Assembly through the main street, posting slogans and shouting slogans such as "Down with the Audit Committee that is delaying the provincial capital's construction," causing pedestrians to gather and block the road. The police were dispatched to maintain order and escort Tao to the provincial government. In the afternoon, all sectors of Hefei invited reporters to a reception of the materials committee to request funding for the construction of the provincial capital's city defenses. Liu Ziheng, a county assemblyman, reported that since Liu Fei went south last year, the people of Hefei have been heavily burdened and are now unable to pay this huge sum. He also said that if they are forced to pay, there will only be strikes. At the same time, 20 members of the Provincial Assembly stationed in the city and assemblymen in Hefei held a meeting and unanimously agreed that the special donation for self-defense was stipulated to be used for the Security Regiment and the arsenal, and could not be used for other purposes. It was decided that: (1) The provincial government should investigate and punish the ringleaders of the incident, (2) Request security guarantees, (3) The Audit Committee should suspend its work temporarily, and (4) The date for convening a temporary congress should be determined separately.</p>

<h3>Rice-Robbing Incident Occurred in Suzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Police Station Chief Reprimanded</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, Our Newspaper, 10th] A rice-robbing incident occurred in Suzhou on the 10th. Although the negotiated price of white rice at Baimen on the 10th was only 22.4 million yuan, rice merchants calculated that there was no profit to be made at all, resulting in some rice shops either selling inferior white rice in the market, or even privately raising prices. It was reported that the price of high-quality white rice had risen as high as 29 million yuan, making it difficult for citizens to purchase, causing emotional impulses. At 8 am, the Jicheng Rice Shop in Nanhao Street outside Banmen, the Gantaihao on Shangtang Street, and the Zhengtaihao on Yadan Bridge all had disputes due to the sale of rice, and were subsequently robbed. Crowds of dozens of people gathered, but fortunately the authorities had ordered the police to be responsible for monitoring and prevention, so they were able to arrive early to suppress the situation and arrest the suspect Zhu Yunduan. The losses of each rice shop were minor, and stability was quickly restored. Afterwards, the responsible persons of the three rice shops and the arrested criminal were all handed over to the county government's military law office for trial. The responsible persons of the three rice shops firmly denied that they had raised prices. As a result, each was handed over to two shopkeepers to guarantee their appearance for investigation. Zhu Yunduan was detained without bail. Guo Yigang, the chief of the police station in charge of the western district, was reprimanded for negligence in prevention. From the 11th, the entire city will be closely guarded to prevent rioters from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Tenth Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly held a security review meeting all day today. Chen Yi and Tang Enbo were both invited to attend and listen to the assembly members' reports on the security situation in various districts. Tang gave a comprehensive reply to the assembly members' questions, stating briefly: The bandit situation in the province is not large-scale and can be extinguished. Bandit suppression is a matter of life and death, and everything should be for bandit suppression. The lack of unified authority lies in improper management and no changes to the pacification agencies are planned.

<h3>The Ambition to Rebuild the Country is also Extraordinary! Entry Ceremony for the Qingnian Training Corps in the Jinan-Suiyuan Region, Provincial Assembly Speaker Pei Mingyu Composes a Poem as a Gift</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan Tenth Dispatch] The Qingnian Training Corps, organized by the local Jinan-Suiyuan region, solemnly held its official entry ceremony at Baima Mountain at 8:00 AM on the tenth. Over a hundred leaders from all sectors in the provincial capital and over 5,000 officers and soldiers of the corps attended, presided over by Wang, the concurrently serving Commander and Chief of the Corps, in person. First, a flag-granting ceremony was held, followed by the entry ceremony. After all the students took an oath, Commander and Chief Wang encouraged them with four points: to establish great ambitions, to be loving and sincere, and to not fear hardship or death. Speaker Pei Mingyu of the Provincial Assembly, in addition to presenting慰勞品 on behalf of all sectors, especially emphasized that the reason why Xiang Yu's 8,000 elite soldiers ultimately failed miserably was because they lacked an ideology and a central belief. Today, you 8,000 soldiers (Note: 3,000 more are being recruited) have the Three Principles of the People and are under the leadership of Commander Wang. In the future, you will surely save Shandong, eliminate the Communist bandits, and complete the mission of the era. At this point, Pei immediately composed a poem to gift to them, which reads: "Eight thousand soldiers go to Qingqi, the ambition to rebuild the country is also extraordinary, swear to sweep away the bandit atmosphere and pacify the national crisis, willing to rely on their own hands to save the afflicted." This garnered a lot of applause from the entire audience. Following speeches by City Assembly Speaker Lü Ziren and others, the student representative gave a reply. After a group photo, the leaders and guests shared a meal of one soup and one vegetable from a large pot with the officers and soldiers of the unit on the square. At 0:30 PM, the corps collectively paraded through Jinan City for a week. In the evening, a movie was shown and a drama was performed to entertain the students' families.

<h3>A Ferry in Hong Kong Sinks After Hitting a Mine, More than Ten People Tragically Drown</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong Tenth Dispatch] A ferry sank after hitting a mine eight miles west of Hong Kong on the ninth, drowning nine passengers and eight crew members. One body has been recovered. Of the 64 passengers, 54 were rescued by passing ships. One female passenger has been sent to the hospital. At the time of the mine explosion, there was a strong wind and rain. Another sailboat nearby also capsized. It is unknown whether any crew members are missing. (According to Associated Press: ten missing, sixty-seven rescued.)</p>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong Tenth Dispatch] When the ferry "Meng Guang" (transliteration) struck a mine, a giant sailboat 600 yards away was also capsized by the force of the explosion.</p>
<h3>Zhangye in Gansu Rich in Jiangnan Flavor, Barren Fields Line the Jiuquan Highway, Most of the Shandan Irrigation Canal is Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiuquan Ninth Dispatch] The Lanzhou reporter Yumen Oil Mine sightseeing group arrived in Zhangye on the fifth and reached Jiuquan at 5:00 PM on the ninth. Along the way, they entered and exited the Great Wall three times. Barren fields lined both sides of the highway. Most of Zuo Gong's willows have withered, and the newly planted ones are unlikely to grow. Within the boundaries of Wuwei and Shandan, irrigation canals crisscross, but without proper channels, farmland rarely benefits. The underground water interception project in Shandan is half a kilometer long, and one-third of the canal has been completed. The water conveyance canal, which is one kilometer long, is mostly completed. The water on the Gobi Desert flows down the canal, and it may be completed this year. In addition, the impression given by the Industrial Cooperative Society Peili School is good. Within Zhangye, water is distributed everywhere, and wheat ears are everywhere, especially with the flavor of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Northern Gansu Establishment Bureau - No People in the Jurisdiction</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiuquan Tenth Dispatch] According to Wang Wei, Special Commissioner of the Seventh District, regarding the current situation of the Northern Gansu Establishment Bureau: The area under the bureau's jurisdiction is about 90,000 square kilometers, but there is not a single person. The bureau governs over a thousand Mongolian people who currently reside in Xihu and Bulongji in Anxi and Dunhuang. The director of the Establishment Bureau also works in the Sandao Gou town of Anxi. This town is more than 400 li away from where the Mongolian people live, and the implementation of government orders is extremely difficult. This kind of administrative organization where people and land are separated from political power is still rare.</p>
<p>Jiuquan People Demand that the Hami People be Sent Back to Xinjiang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiuquan Tenth Dispatch] Regarding the matter of the more than one thousand Hami people in the Yuerhong area of Qilian Mountain being sent back to their original homes in Xinjiang, the people of Jiuquan and the local government unanimously demand that they be sent away within the deadline, starting from August 1st, according to the original plan. Because the Hami people in the area often plunder, the people cannot bear their disturbance, and they even plant opium. Although they repeatedly promised to return to Xinjiang last year, they all delayed their departure when the deadline arrived. Therefore, the people have asked the government to use force to expel them. In addition, more than a thousand Mongolian people in Mazong Mountain are also thinking of entering the Qilian Mountains for grazing. They are currently waiting for an opportunity to move. If the Hami people firmly refuse to move, then bloodshed and disputes between ethnic groups will be inevitable.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Three Powers' Protest to the Soviet Union Released, Declaring the Right to Occupy Berlin, Resumption of Negotiations Requires Lifting the Blockade First</h3>
<p>[Reuters London Ninth Dispatch] The governments of the United States, Britain, and France tonight released the contents of their respective notes of protest to the Soviet Union regarding the blockade of Berlin, pointing out that the Soviet Union's land blockade of Berlin has created an extremely serious international situation and suggesting that the four powers conduct negotiations to discuss the conditions for lifting these blockades. The three powers solemnly declare that even if there are differences of opinion, they should be resolved through negotiations or peaceful means stipulated in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, in accordance with the spirit of United Nations partnership. Any occupying power attempting to impose a blockade on the residents of Berlin is intolerable. It is recalled that previously, a portion of the land first occupied by the Western Allied powers was handed over to the Soviet Union for occupation in exchange for the Western Allied powers' right to participate in the joint administration of Berlin. The Western Allied powers will not abandon these rights due to intimidation, pressure, or other actions. It is hoped that the Soviet government will have no doubts about this.</p>
<p>The notes of the three powers also reiterated that the Western three powers have long accepted the obligation to safeguard the welfare and security of the residents of West Berlin, and the three powers now have no choice but to firmly demand that the traffic between West Germany and Berlin, which was ordered to be blockaded by the Soviet authorities on June 18, be restored immediately. The needs of the civilians in Berlin are undeniable, so the full restoration of traffic to its original state is extremely urgent. Because the Soviet Union has promulgated traffic restrictions, the most basic human rights have also been damaged.</p>
<p>The American note is largely the same as the British and French notes, except that it pointed out that President Truman directly wrote to Stalin on June 14, 1945, suggesting that the United States withdraw its troops from deep within eastern Germany to the boundary originally agreed upon in 1945, provided that the right of the disaster relief army to enter Berlin via railways, highways, and aviation should be guaranteed by the Soviet side. Stalin replied to Truman on the 18th, guaranteeing that he would take all actions in accordance with the plan. The American note continued, stating that if the United States had any doubts about its right to freely enter Berlin, it would not have withdrawn its troops from the large portion of the region currently occupied by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Stalin-Churchill-Roosevelt Secret Agreement Revealed - Powerful Basis for Joint Occupation of Berlin</h3>
<p>The British note, after mentioning the exchange of letters between Truman and Stalin on June 14 and 16, 1945, further stated that Marshal Stalin and Churchill also exchanged similar letters. Based on this understanding, the British 21st Army, which had already reached the line of Wismar - Schwerin - Lüneburg - Domitz, withdrew to within the British occupation zone agreed upon by the four powers, while British troops were sent to Berlin to take on the task of occupation. The agreement on the occupation of Germany and Berlin was thus implemented. If the British government had any doubts about its right to freely enter the British zone of Berlin at that time, it would not have withdrawn from the portion of the region currently occupied by the Soviet army. Therefore, the British government's right to Berlin is based on the same foundation as the Soviet government. How can the former be denied while confirming the latter? In order to avoid any misunderstanding on this point, the British government must solemnly declare that the British occupation of Berlin and free access to Berlin are rights that arose after the overall defeat and unconditional surrender of Germany, and are confirmed by agreements concluded by the major allied powers. Britain will not abandon its rights due to intimidation, pressure, or other actions. It is hoped that the Soviet government will not have any doubts about this. The fact that Berlin is not part of the Soviet zone but an international occupation zone arises from this understanding.</p>
<h3>Based on Humanitarian Grounds - The Blockade Should be Lifted</h3>
<p>The obligation that the commanders of each zone sincerely concluded, which was later confirmed by the Allied Control Council, and other customary measures, guarantee that the British government and other powers have the right to freely enter Berlin to fulfill their responsibilities as occupying countries. The facts and significance are extremely clear. Any other interpretation is sufficient to destroy reasonable rules and international principles. The British government, together with the American and French governments, is now jointly responsible for the welfare of the 2.4 million people in West Berlin at the request of the Soviet government in July 1945. The restrictions recently issued by the Soviet authorities have made it impossible for the British, American, and French governments to fulfill their responsibilities in an appropriate manner. The British responsibility for the welfare and security of the residents of the British zone of Berlin is a humanitarian responsibility. These residents include countless women and children whose health and safety depend on the continued import of essential supplies such as food and medicine into Berlin. These most basic human rights, which our government has solemnly promised to protect, are therefore in imminent danger due to traffic restrictions. Any occupying power attempting to impose a blockade on the residents of Berlin is intolerable. The British government therefore has no choice but to firmly demand the immediate restoration of passenger and freight transport between West Germany and Berlin in accordance with the agreement. The needs of the civilians in Berlin cannot be delayed for a day, so the restoration of traffic is extremely urgent. The British government maintains the above views, but is still willing to resolve differences in a manner that gives fair consideration to all parties concerned. The British government will not agree to handle the differences between the British and Soviet governments regarding the Berlin situation by means of coercion. These differences should be resolved through negotiations or peaceful means stipulated in Article 33 of the Charter. Therefore, the British government is prepared to participate in discussions by the four-power occupying authorities in Berlin to resolve any disputes arising from the administrative problems in Berlin as a first step in finding a solution. However, the restoration of the movement of passengers and goods between West Germany and the British, American, and French zones of Berlin should be a prerequisite for conducting four-power discussions.</p>

<h3>Democratic Party Convention to Officially Open Tomorrow; Eisenhower Firmly Refuses to Be a Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, Philadelphia, 9th] Representatives from various states and territories of the United States arrived here in succession today to prepare for the Democratic National Convention, which will open on Monday to nominate candidates for president and vice president in the November national elections.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party's gathering will be held in the same auditorium where the Republican Party held its convention two weeks ago. The Democratic convention is expected to last four or five days. It is generally believed that President Truman may be nominated as the Democratic candidate. Several other individuals have also been suggested for nomination, most notably General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Chief Justice Douglas of the U.S. Supreme Court. However, both men have expressed their unwillingness to run. President Truman has the support of 286 delegates, and his supporters claim an additional 354, bringing the total to more than the 618 votes needed for nomination. President Truman has stated that if nominated, he has no preconceived notions regarding the selection of a vice president. Potential vice-presidential candidates include Senator Barkley, Representative Rayburn, New York Mayor O'Dwyer, Senator Lucas, Senator O'Mahoney, Representative McCormack, and Justice Douglas.</p>

Eisenhower, currently the President of Columbia University, recently sent a letter to Democratic Senator Borah, stating that he will absolutely not accept the nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate to oppose Dewey. He requested that Borah not nominate him as a Democratic presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention. Political figures believe that Eisenhower's firm statement is a fatal blow to the Democratic Party's chances of winning the election.</p>
<h3>Eastern European Bloc Communist Parties Reject Invitation; Do Not Attend Yugoslav Communist Party Congress; Intention to Isolate Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Following the Soviet Union, communist parties in various European countries today rejected invitations to attend the Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, scheduled to be held in Belgrade on the 21st. The stated reason is that the Yugoslav Communist Party is no longer a member of the communist family.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th] It is believed here that the Soviet Union's participation in the Four-Power proposal to Yugoslavia for convening a Danube River conference indicates that the Soviet authorities regard the Yugoslav government and its communist party as two separate entities, further demonstrating this trend. The Eastern European bloc communist parties' refusal to attend the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress clearly aims to isolate Yugoslavia and force Tito to step down.</p>

<h3>Cominform Issues Statement Condemning Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>— (Originally published in "The Christian Science Monitor," translated by the U.S. Information Service)</p>
<p>The Cominform recently issued a statement condemning Yugoslavia. The following is the main part of the full text, translated from the Czech newspaper *Rudé Právo*.</p>
<p>(1) The Cominform believes that the Yugoslav leadership has recently adopted a completely erroneous policy on major issues of foreign and domestic affairs, violating Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Cominform accepts the proposal of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to expose the erroneous policies of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, especially Comrades Tito, Kardelj, and Djilas Ranković. (Note: Kardelj is the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Djilas is said to be the Minister of Propaganda of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and General Ranković is the Minister of Internal Affairs of Yugoslavia.)</p>
<p>(2) The Cominform has discovered that the Yugoslav leadership has created a policy of hatred towards the Soviet Union and other All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) countries. A disrespectful policy that underestimates Soviet military experts is tolerated in Yugoslavia. At the same time, Soviet military personnel are treated with contempt. Soviet private experts in Yugoslavia are subjected to a special system of constraints; they are watched by state and security agencies; they are under surveillance. The same surveillance and monitoring has been applied to Comrade Zhdánov, the representative of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stationed at the Cominform, as well as to many Soviet officials stationed in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>All these facts prove that the Yugoslav leadership stands on a position unworthy of communists. They regard the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the foreign policy of imperialism as one and the same; they treat the Soviet Union in the same way as they treat bourgeois countries. Because the Yugoslav Central Committee has adopted this anti-Soviet policy, they have carried out all kinds of slanderous propaganda, bringing out Trotskyism, the headquarters of the counter-revolution, publicizing the "degeneration" of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) countries, and publicizing the "degeneration" of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>
<p>The Cominform condemns the anti-Soviet ideology of the Yugoslav leadership, believing that this ideology is only suitable for nationalists and is absolutely incompatible with Marxism-Leninism.</p>
<p>(3) In domestic affairs, the Yugoslav leaders have abandoned the position of the working class and deviated from Marx's theory of class and class struggle. They deny all the facts that capitalist factors have grown in Yugoslavia, thus intensifying the class struggle in the Yugoslav countryside.</p>
<p>The denial is based on an opportunistic view. This view holds that in the process of progressing from capitalism to socialism, the class struggle does not gradually intensify as Marxism-Leninism shows, but rather gradually disappears, just as the opportunist Bukharin thought. Bukharinists advocate the peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism. The Yugoslav leadership is pursuing an erroneous policy in the countryside, ignoring the class differences in rural society. An erroneous idea exists regarding class and class struggle; the well-known Leninist doctrine that small-scale private economies will eventually develop into capitalism and the bourgeoisie has been ignored.</p>
<p>Up to now, the political situation in the Yugoslav countryside gives us no reason to condone or ignore it. Today, the situation in Yugoslavia is that private agriculture dominates, land nationalization does not exist, the ownership of land as private property is legal, everyone can buy and sell land, a considerable amount of land is concentrated in the hands of some rich peasants (who oppose agricultural collectivization), and people can be hired to work. In these circumstances, it is impossible to educate and condone a party that attempts to obscure the class struggle. Because they believe that the peasants are the most solid foundation of the Yugoslav state, the Yugoslav Communist Party's leadership has departed from the Marxist-Leninist line and embarked on the path of nationalism and the kulaks on the issue of the tasks of the labor class.</p>
<p>Lenin once taught us that the proletariat is the only thoroughly revolutionary class in the current society, and therefore must be a leader in the struggle of all laborers (the struggle of the exploited against the oppressors and exploiters), leading all the people in a struggle for a thorough, democratic transformation.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav leaders are now violating this Marxist-Leninist doctrine.</p>

<h3>Clash Between Air Force and Tram Workers; British Company Suspends All Tram Lines for Half a Day; Military Police and Gendarmerie Hold Overnight Joint Trial; Both Sides Injured, Each Claiming the Other Is Responsible</h3>
<p>[By Our Correspondent] All tram lines operated by the British company were suspended starting at noon yesterday in protest of the beating and injury of two tram conductors on Route 8 by Air Force personnel. Military police, gendarmerie, and municipal police authorities, as well as the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, dispatched personnel to the tram depot of the company on Wayside Road to mediate. After numerous twists and turns, Zhang Weihua, the director of the Air Force Supply Headquarters, fully accepted all the demands put forward by the workers, including punishing the perpetrators, compensating for medical expenses, and organizing a temporary military court to immediately investigate the soldiers involved. Only then did the workers agree to resume the operation of all tram lines, both rail and trackless, which was already 8:00 PM. According to company estimates, the loss in revenue during these eight hours reached hundreds of billions.</p>
<p>Route 8, running between the Bund and Yangtszepoo, at 11:32 AM yesterday, the crowded Tram No. 71 passed a stop at Seymour Road without stopping. Two Air Force personnel were waiting at the stop to board the tram, leading to a misunderstanding and a conflict. However, Tram No. 71 continued on its way. Within minutes, Tram No. 89, driven by driver Zhang Genbao, No. 802, arrived on its heels. By that time, many Air Force personnel had gathered at the stop, and more trams continued to arrive, leading to a brawl. Hearing the disturbance, the sentry at the gate of the West Warehouse of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command, located near the stop, rushed to the scene with rifles, dispersing the tram personnel. In the confusion, driver Zhang Genbao, No. 802, and conductor Chen Rukang, No. 2286, were dragged into the Air Force warehouse. According to the two men, they were stripped of their upper garments and their hands were tied behind their backs with ropes and subjected to wanton beatings. Zhang Genbao, No. 802, was kicked and punched and then lifted by several people and thrown to the ground, resulting in the most serious injuries. Fortunately, Section Staff Zhang Shukai of the Huangpu Police Precinct and Liu Songbo, an officer dispatched by the company to negotiate, arrived and secured the release of Zhang and Chen. The two were sent to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Workers Park Trams in Protest; Workers' Emotions Run High; Tram Cars Covered in Slogans</h3>
<p>Following this incident, news spread quickly throughout the depot. Outer service personnel on all lines parked their trams in protest. Trams lined up on Dongdaming Road, Yangtszepoo Road, Zhejiang Road, and other locations, covered in slogans such as "Protest Military Beating Workers" and "What Does the State Raise Soldiers For?" Passersby stopped to inquire, and at one point, there was a false rumor that one of the conductors had been beaten to death. Outer service workers at the Hart Road Depot also stopped work in response, collectively going to the Wayside Road Depot to offer their condolences, forming a complete work stoppage. Yan Zi, Captain of the Second Guard Battalion, Huang Yunlong, Chief of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, Zhang Weihua, Director of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command, Fan Zhenbang, Section Chief of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Section Chief, rushed to the Wayside Road Depot to vigorously persuade the workers to resume operation of all tram lines, but the workers' emotions were running high, and it had no effect.</p>
<p>Director Zhang of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command expressed to the drivers and conductors gathered in the square that he would thoroughly investigate the perpetrators and that even if the Air Force was not responsible, the soldiers who committed the violence would be punished. However, he hoped to resume tram service immediately to maintain traffic. Yan Zi, Captain of the Second Guard Battalion, Huang Yunlong, Chief of the Tilanqiao Precinct, Yan Feixian and Di Jiexian, specialists from the Social Affairs Bureau, also repeatedly urged the workers to resume traffic first and leave the matter to be resolved impartially. At this time, however, workers' representatives had been dispatched to the hospital to check on the injuries of the injured and had not yet returned to the depot to report. At the same time, there were differing opinions among the workers. Some demanded that the perpetrators be handed over first before resuming service, while others demanded that the perpetrators be handed over and immediately tried by a military court before resuming service. Zheng Yangda, the supervisor of the labor union, then asked the military police officers to temporarily retire to the office to rest so that the workers could concentrate their opinions and make a request.</p>

<h3>Workers Propose Four Conditions, Authorities Accept</h3>
<p>The workers in the square then began to discuss and put forward four conditions: (1) A temporary military court should be formed, presided over by military police, gendarmerie, and Social Affairs Bureau officials, with workers sending representatives to attend as observers. (2) All losses of the injured shall be compensated by the perpetrators. (3) The Air Force officer on duty shall be punished. (4) The military police are requested to guarantee to prohibit illegal arrests of workers in the future. If there is any discrepancy, they should be sent to the police station or handed over to the company for handling. After these conditions were put forward, Director Zhang of the Air Force and Captain Yan of the Guard Department stated that they could accept all of them, but on the condition that the workers resume work immediately. However, at this time, the workers' representatives who had gone to the hospital to visit the injured had not yet returned, so a deadlock remained. Subsequently, Chief Huang of the Tilanqiao Police Station brought the injury report from the Municipal Fifth Hospital, reporting in public: "Driver Zhang Baogen, No. 802, has bruises on his chest and legs; Conductor Chen Rukang, No. 2286, has bruises on his chest, and there is subcutaneous bleeding on his right chest wall." None were seriously injured. At the same time, the workers' representatives also returned from the hospital, reporting that there was no danger to life. The workers' emotions then subsided slightly, but because the perpetrators had not been handed over, they still refused to resume work, but agreed to move the vehicles parked on the road into the depot first.</p>
<h3>Tram Service Resumes at Dusk</h3>
<p>Finally, the Air Force sent Liu Jinyi, a mechanic who had clashed with driver Zhang Genbao, No. 802, and who also had a head injury, to the tram depot in a guard vehicle and handed him over to the guard personnel to be taken to the headquarters of the Second Guard Battalion for a joint trial by all the officers. Captain Yan also stated that he would handle the matter impartially. At this point, the workers felt satisfied and sent four representatives, driver Wang Zhijing, conductor Fu Weibang, Gao Naiding, and Bai Wengui, to the Guard Battalion to attend as observers, while the remaining workers dispersed to resume work. By the time the first tram resumed its service, the clock had struck eight.</p>
<h3>Details of the Joint Trial</h3>
<p>The interrogation began at 9:30 PM in the Second Guard Battalion, presided over by Yan Zi, Captain of the Second Guard Battalion, Wang Ruli, Captain of the Dalian Road Gendarmerie, Wang Ximen, Deputy Chief of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, Zhang Weihua, Director of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command, and Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau. First, the Air Force mechanic Liu Jinyi was interrogated. He claimed that he was going home for dinner after getting off work at 11:30 AM. When he left the warehouse, he saw a commotion in front of him, went to watch, and was hit hard on the head by driver No. 802 with an iron wrench without asking why, so he dragged the driver into the factory. He knew nothing else. The workers' representatives then stated the situation and the process of the dragging of driver No. 802 and conductor No. 2286 into the warehouse and their being tied up and beaten. However, because they had not witnessed it themselves, but only heard it from other drivers and conductors, they could not accurately say what happened. Zhang Shukai, a staff member of the Tilanqiao Police Station who went to the Air Force warehouse after the incident to bail out the detained driver and conductor, reported that he did indeed witness that the hands of driver No. 802 and conductor No. 2286 were tied behind their backs. The Air Force personnel asked him to write a receipt stating "Received the perpetrator and the weapon" before releasing them and sending them to the Fifth Hospital. (Note: The two injured were later transferred to Jimin Hospital by Wu Jinrong, the chief inspector of the tram company). At this point, the officers of the joint trial sternly questioned He Yimou, the duty officer of the warehouse, and Du Dingyu, the platoon leader of the guards, as to whether they had tied up the workers or witnessed anyone tying them up. The Director of the Supply Headquarters also urged them to tell the truth, considering the reputation of the Air Force. However, they all claimed that they did not know what was happening in the chaos at the time. After the officers of the joint trial exchanged opinions, they believed that mechanic Liu Jinyi himself was injured, and the truth of the dispute still needed to be investigated, and that whoever tied up the workers should be found and severely punished. Therefore, it would be best for the two injured workers to personally describe the process and identify the perpetrators. Captain Yan then sent personnel to Jimin Hospital to bring in the two injured drivers and conductors, but the hospital did not allow them to be taken away because the two were not fully recovered from their injuries. At this time, it was nearly midnight. Because the injured parties from the tram company had not arrived, the officers of the joint trial could not clarify the truth, and the four workers' representatives had no right to represent all the workers in reaching a settlement, so it was decided to suspend the interrogation temporarily and identify the perpetrators after the two injured arrive today in order to verify and handle the case.</p>

<h3>Smuggling of American Aid Materials Discovered on Ship Arriving in Shanghai; Crew Members Smuggle Goods; Value Exceeds 2 Billion Yuan; Three Suspects Transferred to Court for Trial</h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, the *Wanmei* Wheel, belonging to the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Iwo Jima, loaded with American aid materials, and docked at Wusong.

<h3>Gunshots and Blood at the New Light Theater; Manager Shot and Injured; Bullet Casings Found on the Road</h3>
<p>[By Our Correspondent] Xia Lianliang, manager of the New Light Theater on Ningbo Road, a local, 41 years old, resident at 1410 Huashan Road, West Shanghai, yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, Xia, as usual, went to the theater office from his residence, accompanied by his nephew Wu Yifeng (20 years old, a student at the New China Law and Commerce College on Pingliang Road), in his own car No. 1410, driven by the driver Tao Chadi. When Xia got out of the car and stepped on the stone steps at the entrance of the New Light Theater, he suddenly heard two gunshots coming from the entrance of the theater. Xia rushed into the manager's office, still unaware that he had been shot twice. For a time, the stone steps were stained with blood, and the movie fans standing outside the door ran away in panic. When Xia sat down in the manager's office, he realized that he had been shot in the right wrist, and a bullet had pierced through his left abdomen and entered his right leg, neither bullet exiting. The gray suit he was wearing had two holes in it, stained with blood. Upon receiving the report, the Zhabei Police Precinct, led by Zhao Zhaosheng, the chief of the precinct, Wang Huachen, the deputy chief, Jiang Shangpei, the section chief, and Zhang Kuidong, a staff member, rushed to the scene to investigate. They found two bullet casings on the road in front of the candy store next door. Xia took himself to Hongren Hospital for treatment, and after diagnosis and surgery by the doctor, his condition was good. (Note: Xia was a student of Rui Qingrong, who died of illness in Chongqing during the War of Resistance.)</p>

<h3>Inheriting the Will to Commemorate Ancestors: The Cheng Brothers Enthusiastically Benefit Needy Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a donation of 100 million yuan from readers Cheng Renhao, Renwu, Renzhen, and Bu Shi to help students through the newspaper's reader scholarship fund. In their accompanying letter, they said:</p>
<p>"Our late mother, Madam Tao, was enthusiastic about education. She often gave money to help the children of poor relatives and friends for decades. Last summer, our mother passed away from illness. Before her death, she still instructed Hao and others to economize on food and clothing and use the remaining funds to help students. This year, July 9th is the anniversary of our mother's death. In order to break superstitions, Hao and others have especially saved 100 million yuan from Buddhist ceremonies to help students, so as to continue our mother's unfinished business..."</p>
<p>Every day in this vast city, countless billions of dollars are often spent on superstitious practices. The Cheng brothers are able to break customs and commemorate their kind mother by helping students, turning uselessness into usefulness. This is truly something worthy of praise.</p>
<p>We hope this is a beginning. If everyone can follow the example of the Cheng brothers and donate generously, we believe that in the near future, the fundraising work for the newspaper's scholarship fund will be able to reach its expected goal.

<h3>Collective Forced Marriages in the Taihang Area: Buying an Old Man, Resulting in New Marital Woes</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan Dispatch] In broad daylight, under the clear sky, it's truly unbelievable that this is happening in human society. This is a "collective forced marriage case" protected by "law," occurring in Guobao Village, Guan County, under the clutches of the Communist bandits in the Taihang area.</p>
<p>Jia Laobian is a farmer's daughter from Guobao Village, twenty-one years old this year. She is beautiful and charming, and has long been coveted by Communist cadres at all levels. However, because she married Wang Heinian from Koutou Village at the age of nineteen and lived a loving life after marriage, they had never been able to lay their hands on her.</p>
<p>Separation of the Lovebirds</p>
<p>After the "Land Reform Movement," according to "law," the poor were not allowed to marry the children of rich peasants. Wang Heinian was labeled a rich peasant, and according to "law," he was forced to divorce his beloved wife, Jia Laobian. On February 22 of this year, the divorce procedures were completed at the "village government." The lovebirds were suddenly separated, their hearts broken. For a moment, they couldn't help but cry loudly, moving the entire village to sorrow.</p>
<p>After the divorce, Jia Laobian returned to her parents' home in Guobaobao Village. The Communist henchmen of Guobao Village thought the time was ripe and began to "attack" her day and night, saying, "Our village's vice-director of the armed committee, Jia Laomi, and the demobilized soldier Guo Haisheng are both bachelors. You can choose to marry either one of them." Jia Laobian hated this in her heart, but she didn't dare to offend them too much, so she feigned a smile and said, "I just got divorced not long ago. Let's talk about it in a year. I won't marry anyone right now." The bandits, grinning cheekily, persisted in their entanglement, saying, "Maybe you don't want to marry Jia Laomi because you嫌 he has sores (syphilis). You should just marry Guo Haisheng!" Jia Laobian refused all of them. Later, the bandits held a meeting to discuss and decided to concentrate their firepower and take turns "attacking." After three days and three nights of "siege," she still refused, which angered the Communist instructor Jia Changfa. He slammed the table, glared fiercely, and said, "If you marry Lao Guo, everything will be fine. If you don't marry him, your mother won't have an easy time!" The head of the farmers' association coaxed her from the side, "If you marry a young man, he'll have to go to the army, and you'll be a widow anyway. If you marry Lao Guo, you won't have any problems, and he can even take care of your mother." With threats and inducements, they repeatedly forced her, but Jia Laobian, with her determination to "rather die than marry a Communist cadre," resolutely refused.</p>
<p>Three Zhang of Cloth</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the 28th, Mai Changfa, leading five or six ruffians with fierce expressions, came to Laobian's house shouting all the way. As soon as they entered, they said, "You can have whatever you want. Here's three zhang of cloth for you to sew some clothes to get married." Jia Laobian's heart sank, and she pleaded with tears, "I don't want anything. Please have mercy on me. I don't want to get married right now." The bandits were furious and shouted in unison, "Whether you want to or not, you have to!" With that, they threw down the three zhang of cloth, turned around and left, saying as they left, "Tomorrow you will be arrested as a 'big special agent' because you don't show respect for the cadres and refuse to listen!"</p>
<p>Threatening Letter</p>
<p>That same night, as Mai Laobian was weeping with her mother, she received a threatening letter, which read, "This afternoon, a letter came from the district saying that you don't want to marry Guo Haisheng, and tonight you will be arrested and taken to the district." It was signed by Political Director Jia Taixi. The person delivering the letter took out the district's official document from his pocket and slapped it hard, saying, "Look, the district's official document says that if you think it through, you don't have to go tonight, you can just get married tomorrow." The "Director of People's Education" snorted and said, "The marriage must happen!"</p>
<p>The next morning, the bandits gathered again in the "cooperative" to discuss a "full-scale attack" and instructed Guo Haisheng to prepare several hundred thousand yuan worth of wedding supplies. At the third watch of the night on the 29th, Jia Laobian was already fast asleep. Guo Haisheng opened the door according to the original plan and broke in, smiling and saying to Jia Laobian, "We're going to get married tomorrow. Everything is ready. I'll sleep with you tonight!" Laobian trembled all over, calling for her mother, and covered herself with the quilt. Guo Haisheng jumped onto the bed and raped her in front of her mother. The three of them twisted together, their cries, shouts, and calls for help intertwined. The neighbors were all frightened and at a loss, but after all, he didn't get his way. Before leaving, Guo Haisheng punched and kicked the mother and daughter.</p>
<p>Entering the Bridal Chamber</p>
<p>On the third day, bandits such as the political director, the director of people's education, and the chairman of the farmers' association arrived at Laobian's house in groups, claiming to "reason with her." They said, "If you didn't want to marry him, you shouldn't have accepted the cloth! Guo Haisheng also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. You have to compensate him for everything. If you can't compensate him, we'll drive you out of the village." Another said, "If you don't pay, you won't get away with it today. Let's see how capable you are, still looking down on the cadres?" After saying that, the "political director" went to beat the gong to summon the women for a meeting to denounce Jia Laobian. At this time, Jia Laobian, filled with grief and indignation, pretended to go to the toilet and hanged herself. Her mother waited a long time and didn't see her return. When she went to the toilet to look, Jia Laobian was already dying. She was immediately rescued, fortunately not dying, but vomiting several mouthfuls of fresh blood. The bandits, upon hearing that Laobian had attempted suicide, not only did not show pity but were even more angry. As soon as she woke up, they dragged her to the "winter school" and ordered her to confess "why she didn't want to marry Guo Haisheng," and encouraged some female hooligans, saying, "Jia Laobian has sabotaged the village's land law outline and the textile movement. Everyone should beat her so she can't get out of bed for five days." All the women in the village, under the bandits' coercion and surveillance, used ropes, shoe soles... beating her senseless. They beat her four times in rotation, beating her to the point of death, her flesh and blood blurred. The pitiful Jia Laobian, unable to endure this torture, agreed to "willingly marry." That night, Guo Haisheng hosted a dumpling feast at the house of the "women's salvation director" Li Guohui for the "comrades" who had "helped" him and entered the "bridal chamber." The next day, the bandits celebrated wildly, congratulating each other, saying, "The great event has been accomplished!" (Times News Agency)</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 10th] The Suzhou Xishan liner Xinxing, organized by the Shanghai fellow villagers association of Dongting Xishan County, braved the danger of a hurricane on the 6th, carrying more than eighty passengers and towing a tugboat.

<p>Hundreds of Thatched Cottages in Zha Pu Huangshan District Destroyed by Typhoon</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Pinghu, 8th] This year, the local villagers in the Huangshan scenic area of Zha Pu County built thatched cottages in the mountains for tourists to live in, totaling more than four hundred rooms. On the 6th and 7th, a typhoon swept through Zha Pu. Because the thatched cottages were simply built, mostly with mud walls, or bamboo walls plastered with thin lime, more than a hundred rooms were destroyed by the wind and rain.

<h3>Haining's Raging Tide: Thousands of Acres of Salt Fields Submerged, Salt Farmers' Livelihoods Cut Off, Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Haining, 9th] These days are just the time for high tides. The "Haining tide" has raged again. Around 12:00 on the night of the 7th, the night tide reached a height of more than one zhang, rushing in like thousands of horses. More than ten li from Wengbu to Laoyancang, thousands of acres of salt fields outside the embankment were submerged by the raging tide. People standing in the salt fields had water up to their necks. The salt farmers woke up in the middle of the night, crying and shouting to the heavens. Fortunately, the rescue was quick, and no one was injured. However, the salt farmers' household furniture and salt slabs and buckets used for salt production were all washed away. The tide receded on the 8th, and the salt farmers returned to find their remaining belongings, a very miserable sight. The production of these more than ten thousand acres of salt fields has temporarily stopped, and the livelihoods of the salt farmers have been cut off. The authorities are finding ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Since the outer embankment of Haining County collapsed, the embankment itself is showing signs of danger. The Jueyu seawall may be in danger at any time.

<h3>The Course of the Great Victory in Eastern Henan: 100,000 Bandit Combat Troops Annihilated</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Li Tian</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 9th by air] After Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi spoke with this newspaper's reporter about his impressions of the great victory in eastern Henan (see the front page yesterday), his deputy chief of staff, Zhang Yujin, further reported the detailed course of this battle as follows:</p>
<p>This time, the Communist bandits, with 250,000 troops from the main force of ten columns, when crossing the Yellow River from western Shandong, did not dare to act rashly because they were monitored and attacked by two powerful army corps of the National Army. At this time, Chen Yi's bandit troops (3rd, 8th, and 10th columns) in western Henan took advantage of the thin strength of the National Army in Kaifeng and occupied Bianyuan. At the same time, the bandits from western Shandong went south to support them. The National Army, in order to annihilate the main force of the bandits, immediately tracked and suppressed them. After recovering Wen, they continued south, pressing the bandits into the Yellow River flooded area. Because the National Army was pursuing them too closely, the bandits turned around and, starting on the night of June 28th, surrounded the Shen Chengnian division of the Youth Army Corps near Longwangdian, northwest of Sui County, and surrounded the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps west of Qi County. The bandits attacking the Shen division were from the (1st, 6th, and 3rd) columns, a total of three-six regiments, while the Shen division only had six regiments. The bandits originally planned to "eat" the Shen division in two or three days, and then join forces with the (3rd, 8th, and 10th) columns that were originally attacking the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps to "eat" the Qiu division and attempt to realize their dream of crossing the river. Unexpectedly, the Shen division fought to the bitter end. The bandits used human wave tactics and fire sea tactics to encircle and attack for five days and nights, but they did not succeed. In one case, a certain defending army only had one battalion. The bandits surrounded and attacked with three regiments for a day and night, and were completely wiped out. The next day, the bandits transferred another three regiments to attack, and the entire battalion heroically sacrificed. The indomitable Shen division, after holding out to the sixth day, after gaining the price of "one for three," was fortunately reinforced by the Huang Baitao and Sun Yuanliang Army Corps of the National Army, which rushed from the east and west. At the same time, the Qiu and Shen divisions attacked outward. The air force extensively bombed the areas occupied by the bandits in the unshielded Yellow River flooded area day and night. Especially because the weather was fine for nine days, without a drop of rain, by the evening of the 7th, the bandits finally could not hold out and fled in three directions: southwest, northeast, and southeast. The main force fled to Caoxian and the old Zhucheng area in southwestern Shandong. The National Army is closely pursuing and suppressing them with newly reinforced troops. This is just as Commander-in-Chief Liu said: not only did it shatter their dream of crossing the river, but it also made it impossible for them to flee north across the river, and it will annihilate them in one fell swoop. Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang concluded by saying: The greatest successes of this battle were (1) that the more than 100,000 bandits annihilated were mostly combat troops; (2) that not only was Chen Yi's main force defeated, but Liu Bocheng's main force also suffered heavy losses; (3) due to the victory on the main battlefield in eastern Henan, the siege on the branch battlefield in Yanzhou can be resolved soon, the bandits acting recklessly in northern Jiangsu towards Huaiyin can be eliminated, and the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway can be reopened soon. Therefore, as of now, we can say that we have shattered 70% of the bandits' summer offensive. (4) This battle shows the strong fighting will of the National Army. On the contrary, the bandits scattered after being defeated, and their combat discipline collapsed. (5) At the beginning of this battle, the National Army headquarters did not shy away from its seriousness, so it was able to raise vigilance, closely deploy, and fight to the bitter end, and finally achieved the greatest victory since the suppression of the rebellion.</p>

<h3>July's Price Increase Becomes More Fierce: Rice Sold Close to 30 Million, Price Limits for Flour, Oil, and Grain Are Broken</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] After the price of rice exceeded the 20 million mark, it paused for several days, but yesterday it suddenly rose again. In the northern market, white japonica rice was 25 million per shi, and in the southern market, white japonica rice was 23 million per shi, and both were medium-grade rice, with an average increase of about 1.5 million per shi compared to the previous day. The retail price is approaching the 30 million mark. It is said that the reason for this sudden increase is due to the sharp rise in prices in the producing areas. White japonica rice in Wuxi also reached 24 million per shi.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The regulated price of rice was automatically raised to 23 million yesterday, but due to the frequent increase in quotations in Wuxi, the producing area, and the increase in prices of various non-agricultural products, as well as various rumors, people's hearts were agitated, and only inferior indica rice was traded at the regulated price in the market. The off-market price for superior white japonica rice was 27 million, thin-hulled yang indica was also 27 million, up 3.5 million. Early rice was 25 million, japonica indica was 24 million, and Baiyuan was 26.5 million. A total of 407 shi arrived in the north and south markets.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Although prices were regulated, with broad beans at 11.8 million, Che beans at 13.5 million, and other grains also regulated, the regulated prices were not cost-effective due to the sharp rise in prices of various non-agricultural products, so no one offered them. However, broad beans were supplied by various businesses to the street for actual sales, and about 400 packages were allocated at the regulated price of 11.8 million, five packages per household. There were few transactions in other miscellaneous grains. Yuan wheat rose by 3 million, horse beans rose by 1.5 million, sesame was not traded, and Hefei raw kernels rose to 46 million.</p>

However, this price was still not cost-effective based on yesterday's costs, so it could not be traded. Later, the oil factories jointly supplied the street market needs, distributing soybean oil and raw rapeseed oil, at a rate of five or ten dan per household, with the price according to the price limit. Due to the sharp rise in prices of various non-agricultural products, off-market prices for soybean oil were as high as 60 million, Gijiton熟 rapeseed oil was 58 million, and Gijiton small sesame oil was 70 million, an increase of 5 million to 6 million each.

After 10 o'clock, a full board of red was presented again. Gauze surged by 40%, boosting other goods. The general currency chips once again went to the stock market for a way out. Demand exceeded supply, and formal transactions disappeared. At the most popular time, Wing On added up to 550, SIIC needed another 10%, Xinguang added 3 yuan, and Jingfu added 1.5 yuan.

As a result, all goods were not opened for trading.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Stops Fatigue and Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Zhentu and other green teas, mainly for export to Africa, have suddenly turned volatile since the general profit-taking cargo owners sold them off some time ago. However, the market unanimously stopped being fatigued and turned stable yesterday. Although prices did not rise, all revealed a firm state. Considering the reasons, the raw tea material production price has repeatedly increased, and the levy for processing and copying is increasing daily. Sellers are hoarding and holding, and the situation has turned around. Other varieties also began to stir at noon. As a result, there was a unanimous response, and many saw an upward trend. However, buyers felt that it was not easy to absorb smoothly for a while, and temporarily held a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Although Transactions are Scarce, the Rising Wind is Astonishing; Gauze Creates Unprecedented High Prices</h3>

There were 22 single transactions throughout the day, with 96 pieces traded.</p>

The self-filled prices were about 33 million to 6.5 million, limited to dyeing factories to purchase.</p>
<h3>Gauze Payment Methods Improved by National Banks</h3>
<p>Regarding the methods of payment for gauze quotas allocated by the Yarn and Gauze Control Committee collected by the Central Bank, the Textile Construction Company once asked the Yarn and Gauze Control Committee to request the Central Bank to improve them. It is now learned that in order to facilitate the payment of money for all allotted customers, the Central Bank has, from today, stipulated that those who pay before 12:00 noon may use bank cashier's checks or checks for payment. Overtime payments must be paid in cash sealed by the bank, otherwise they will not be accepted.

<h3>Smuggling into Guangdong Customs Has Sharply Decreased in the Past Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 10th] (1) According to Guangdong Customs, since June, import smuggling has sharply decreased. In the past, there were nearly a thousand cases per month, but since June, it has been reduced by half. The reason is that in addition to the strict joint investigation by the Chinese and British governments, the main reason is that sales of various goods at home and abroad are weak, and fewer inland merchants come to handle goods.

<h3>Six Points of Attention for Merchants Trading with Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office yesterday received six points of attention from the Ministry of Economic Affairs transferred from the Commercial Commissioner's Office of the Delegation to Japan, which merchants should pay attention to when reviewing trade plans with Japan:</p>
<p>(1) When merchants apply to change trade plans, if they intend to add or change the items of import and export, they must be within the scope of the list of import and export goods to Japan approved by the government in that year. (2) When merchants apply to change trade plans, if they are items on the list of goods for import and export to Japan that have no quantity limit, they can submit the plan to the ministry for approval. (3) When merchants apply to add or change import and export items, if the quantity or value exceeds what is listed in the original plan, the Commercial Commissioner should first telegraph the ministry for approval. (4) For items with quotas listed in the original plan, if both parties agree to mutually transfer them, and the total quota after the transfer does not exceed the sum of the original quotas of both parties, and does not affect the interests of third parties, the Commercial Commissioner may approve it and report it to the ministry for record. (5) When merchants withdraw goods in accordance with the approved plan, if the total selling price stipulated in each contract is less than 50,000 US dollars, the Commercial Commissioner may review it and submit it to the head of the delegation to Japan for approval before signing the contract. For those exceeding 50,000 US dollars, the inventory preparation situation must first be investigated before reviewing and approving it. As for the amount of contracts that have been signed but not yet fulfilled, it should be calculated together when reading the contract. If the new contract and the original unfulfilled part of the contract total more than 50,000 US dollars, the spot goods must first be inspected before handling. (6) For contracts exceeding 50,000 US dollars, the Commercial Commissioner should directly apply to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office for responsible investigation and reply. If the inventory preparation for the exceeding part is 60% or more, the person should sign the contract according to the number. If it is less than 60%, report to the ministry for instructions first.</p>

<h3>Circular to All Provincial and Municipal Departments to Comply With; Banning Unregistered Private Schools; Mostly Violating Laws and Misleading Young People; No Enrollment Allowed Without Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all provincial and municipal education departments on the 10th to strictly ban private schools that have not been approved and have started to enroll students. The main idea is that the establishment of private schools to cultivate young people and supplement national education should be encouraged and supported by the government. However, private schools should be established in accordance with regulations and relevant laws to meet standards.

It is hereby announced that if there are those who have not complied with the regulations and have not been approved for establishment, and have enrolled students on their own, they should immediately set up a secret investigation and ban them immediately, and not be lenient in any way, so as to emphasize education. It is hoped that this will be strictly complied with.</p>

<h3>The Last Batch of World Games Delegation Departs from Shanghai Today; Led by Chief Leader Wang Zhengting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Chinese delegation to the 14th Olympic World Games departs in three batches. The first two batches of basketball and football teams have already left the country. The last batch, including Huang Shouyi, Hao Gengsheng, Lu Xiangqian, Shi Zhaokang, and track and field athletes Lou Wenao and Chen Yinglang, etc., led by Chief Leader Dr. Gong Zhengting, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the UK on a China Aviation Corporation Gu Wang aircraft at 7:00 AM today. It will pass through Hong Kong and Kunming, arrive in Yangon tonight, fly to Calcutta tomorrow, and leave India for London on a British aircraft on the 13th. The list of World Games delegation members leaving the country today is as follows:</p>
<p>(Chief Leader) Wang Zhengting (Secretary-General) Dong Shouyi (Chief Coach) Hao Gengsheng (Chinese Secretary) Tian Hanxiang (English Secretary) Feng Chengzhen (Secretary) Shi Zhaokang Lu Xiangqian (Assistant Secretary) Wu Zhiguo (Track and Field Athletes) Lou Wenao Chen Yinglang</p>
<h3>Chief Leader Wang Zhengting Reports on the Registration, Preparation, and Participation Process</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Dr. Gong Zhengting, the chief leader of the Chinese World Games delegation, gave a detailed report on the process of preparing for and participating in this World Games by the China National Sports Federation, the organization of the delegation, and the fundraising, etc., at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Kangle Restaurant before leaving the country, inviting reporters from various newspapers in the city. He also said that Chief Coach Ma John was unable to go abroad due to poor health, and Advisor Hao Gengsheng has been appointed concurrently. The summary of Wang's speech is recorded below:</p>
<h3>The Delegation's Formation Process</h3>
<p>After receiving an invitation from the Organizing Committee of the 14th World Games in London, the China National Amateur Athletic Federation (體協) actively began preparations. The organization of the delegation, the selection of athlete representatives, and various regulations were all based on decisions made by the board of directors and supervisors, and were by no means subject to arbitrary changes. On January 7, 1947, the Standing Committee of the 體協 nominated Wang and John Ma, Rong Qizhao, Song Junfu, Jiang Lianggui, Xu Minhui, and Ji Shouyi, seven people in total, to form a selection committee. This selection committee then nominated various single-sport selection committees to select participating athletes. Subsequently, on November 2, 1947, a joint meeting of the 體協's board of directors and supervisors nominated Mr. Ren as the chief leader, Huang Shouyi as the secretary-general, John Ma as the head coach, Rong Qizhao as the football team leader, Jiang Lianggui as the basketball team leader, Li Huitang as the football team instructor, Song Junfu as the basketball team instructor, and Xu Minhui as the swimming team leader and instructor. On February 18, 1948, the Standing Committee approved the appointment of Ambassador Zheng Tianxi as an advisor. On May 3, 1948, the Standing Committee of the 體協, in addition to approving the organizational regulations of the Chinese delegation, also appointed Hao Gengsheng, Zhong Yuting, and Hu Hao as advisors, and Chen Yaosheng and Lai Tianchang (secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the UK) as liaisons, Tian Hanxiang as the Chinese secretary, Feng Chenzhen as the foreign language secretary, and Shi Zhaokang and Lu Xiangqian as staff members. In accordance with the organizational regulations of the delegation, the chief leader appointed Jia Lulu as manager and Wu Zhigang as assistant staff to assist with various matters of the delegation. As for Qian Xucang, Gu Qianlin, Wang Tongyuan, Zhuang Youren, and Gu Jiazhen, who went to the games at their own expense, this was based on the sixth resolution of the Standing Committee of the 體協 on May 3, 1948: "Socially enthusiastic people in sports who are enthusiastically donating to the federation's expenses and are willing to participate in the World Games at their own expense may be appointed as members of the delegation by the chief leader, following the precedents of the previous games."</p>
<h3>Fundraising</h3>
<p>According to the regulations of the International Olympic Committee, it is composed of amateur athletes from countries around the world, with representatives generated by the national amateur athletic bodies. The 體協 was concerned about the funding for participation in the World Games, which posed quite a problem. The initial budget was US$120,000, but the national treasury was depleted and the government could not provide substantial financial assistance. Therefore, the 體協's board of directors and supervisors organized a fundraising committee, appointing Wang and Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Zhenggang, Wu Guozhen, Hu Wenhu, and others as members, to solicit donations from various parties. On one hand, they requested the government to subsidize US$60,000, raise US$60,000 themselves, solicit US$30,000 from overseas Chinese, and raise US$30,000 domestically. As a result, they only received a subsidy of US$25,000 from the government, which was far from sufficient. This sum was only received on June 26. As for the donations solicited from various enthusiastic people in society, they were received gradually, totaling 8,492 million yuan in national currency. All expenses during the preparation period, as well as the expenses for selection and training, were paid from the raised funds. At the same time, due to severe food shortages in the UK after the war, most of the food for the representatives of various countries had to be self-provided. Therefore, on April 21, the delegation purchased grain and other necessities to be shipped by sea. All income and expenditure accounts will be sent to the government and donors separately after the World Games to ensure transparency. In addition, the donations raised domestically were all in legal tender and deposited in banks. Foreign exchange was applied for in mid-March, but was not approved. They were also unable to purchase foreign exchange in the black market. Fortunately, part of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) tickets were allowed to be paid in legal tender, which was a great help from the government to the World Games delegation. In addition, Hao Dongsheng raised US$25,000 in Nanyang. The football and basketball teams also went abroad in advance, reducing some of the burden. Such was the economic situation that allowed the World Games delegation to go ahead.</p>
<h3>Hoping for Assistance in Fulfilling the Mission</h3>
<p>The World Games delegation, from the standpoint of the Chinese people's amateur athletic body, participated in this World Games. For those in society who are usually enthusiastic about sports and who have donated funds to the delegation, the move to appoint them as advisors was made. The selection of these advisors was all based on the resolution of the Standing Committee of the 體協 on May 3, 1948. All selected individuals were well-known figures in society, such as Zhong Yuting and Hu Hao, who are usually enthusiastic about sports. Under the conditions of financial difficulties and a lack of manpower, those responsible for the preparations for the Chinese World Games delegation have asked themselves if they have taken great pains and tried their best. They are grateful for the generous donations of funds from enthusiastic people in sports from all sides, as well as the allocation of funds from the state. China's amateur sports are still in their infancy and still rely on the concerted efforts of all parties in the country to promote them. They are deeply grateful for the detailed instructions from all sectors of society regarding this participation in the world competitions.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhenglin Not Selected – Our World Games Track and Field Representative</h3>
<p>Wang Zhenglin, a long-distance runner, previously went to the United States with Lou Wenao for performances. Lou returned to China while Wang remained in the United States. At the time, it was rumored that Wang had been allowed by Wang Zhengting, chairman of the 體協, to go directly to England to participate in the World Games. However, according to Mr. Wang yesterday, Wang Zhenglin was not selected by the track and field selection committee, and therefore could not represent our country. Subsequently, Hao Gengsheng stated: "When Lou and Wang went to the United States, I had a personal discussion with Mr. Wang Zhengting about whether they could be given special consideration to represent our country if they were unable to return to China. Mr. Wang nodded in agreement. This was the actual situation at the time. However, Lou has already returned to China and participated in the national games, while Wang remained in the United States and was not selected through legal procedures. There have also been various rumors about his actions in the United States, so he cannot be a World Games athlete for us."</p>
<h3>World Games Delegation Air Tickets Handled by China Travel Service</h3>
<p>The air tickets and seat reservations for the World Games delegation were entrusted to China Travel Service. According to Dr. Wang Zhengting, the chief leader, the company has a long-standing reputation for trustworthiness. The rumor that the delegation received rebates on ticket purchases is absolutely false.</p>
<h3>Chinese Baseball Team Victoriously Defeats U.S. Army – 7 to 5, Overcoming Defeat</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Chinese baseball team yesterday, in the U.S. Navy League at the Racecourse, under extremely unfavorable circumstances, inspired by coach Liang Fuchu and leader Mei Qiju, fought valiantly and turned the tide with a 7-5 victory over the U.S. Army, maintaining a line of hope to compete with the Air Force again in the second cycle.</p>
<p>In yesterday's game, the Chinese team had to reluctantly make do because catcher He Jinben's hand injury had not healed. Bao Guanda barely filled the vacancy, resulting in a complete lack of coordination in the defense and numerous loopholes. The morale was extremely low and the team almost fell victim to the U.S. Army. Fortunately, the lineup was adjusted in the fourth inning, and Cao Kejia was used to face the challenge with a new formation. Leader Mei and Coach Liang shouted at the top of their voices to cheer on the Chinese athletes, gradually turning the tide. Taking advantage of the U.S. Army's disarray, they launched a full-fledged attack. After a fierce three-hour battle, they finally reversed the defeat and won the final victory. The scores of each inning are recorded below:</p>
<p>In addition, there will be two more games in the U.S. Navy Baseball League this afternoon. At 1:30 PM, the Air Force will play the Navy, and at 4:00 PM, China will play Patrol (represented by the Helena). The Chinese team tested a new formation yesterday and achieved satisfactory results. If there are no accidents today, they are expected to win again. The new lineup is recorded below:</p>
<p>Liang Yousheng, pitcher; Cao Kejia, catcher; Yu Changluan, first base; Liang Chengcong, second base; Bao Guanwen, third base; Liang Youwen, shortstop; Liang Youyi, left field; Zhong Baoluo, center field; Lu Zhaosen, right field. Reserves: Bao Lida, He Jingui, He Jinben, Li Qiteng, Mei Yingjun, Wang Nianzi.</p>
<h3>Red Sox Defeats Air Force</h3>

<p>In addition, there were originally two softball friendly matches scheduled for today. The Red Machine was scheduled to play the Pandas in the morning and the West Youth in the afternoon.

<h3>Chekhov's Notebook</h3>
<p>— Shuanglu</p>
<p>For a lover of a great writer, even a fragment is precious enough. Therefore, the newly published "Chekhov's Notebook" will surely be cherished by readers who love Chekhov. Even a layman will find immense joy in reading it.</p>
<p>From 1892 to 1904, when Chekhov's reputation was at its peak, he left behind a notebook. He wrote down things that occurred to him by chance, even the outlines of his novels, but many of them were never written into novels later. For example, he wrote a story outline: "A woman with radical ideas, makes the sign of the cross every night, but is filled with prejudice and superstition at heart. She hears that as long as she boils a black cat to death at night, she will be happy. So she steals a cat and wants to boil it." For a Chekhov reader, one would inevitably want to ask: If Chekhov were to write this into a novel, how would he write it?</p>
<p>He also wrote another story outline: "A student in a village seminary is memorizing Latin. Every half hour, he runs to the maids' room downstairs, closes his eyes, touches them, and pinches them. The maids laugh and shout. After fooling around like this, he goes back upstairs to study. He calls this 'entertainment'."</p>
<p>These notes may not be comparable to what is found in the notebooks of modern great writers such as Gide and Henry James, but we can see how Chekhov developed his stories from ordinary things and ordinary observations.</p>
<p>He also wrote: "A young man earned a million marks, lay on these marks, and shot himself with a gun." The reader will immediately sense a genuine Chekhov atmosphere. In these notes, just as in his letters, he would sometimes change his serious, objective attitude and say a few witty words. No wonder Tolstoy called him a marvel. For example, he wrote: "Medicine is my wife, and literature is my mistress. When I get tired of one, I go to the other to spend the night. Although this is irregular, it is not boring, and neither of them loses anything because of my infidelity."</p>
<p>In his letters, Chekhov clearly stated his writing attitude: "My purpose is to kill two birds with one stone: on the one hand, to faithfully describe life, and on the other hand, to show how far this life is from the ideal life." He also said that a writer "should be as objective as a pharmacist… He must know that a pile of useless dirt plays a very important role in the landscape, and that evil passions and good passions are equally hidden in life." Chekhov achieved all of this in literature.</p>
<h3>Living in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Because our school is located in a village at the bottom of Yangshupu, living there all day is like being detached from the world. The international Cold War and the fluctuations in Shanghai's prices, if not for reading newspapers to learn a little, are simply as incomprehensible as "not knowing the Wei and Jin dynasties, let alone the Qin and Han dynasties," and have become a standard bumpkin. However, the true meaning of living in the countryside lies here. Tranquility and simplicity are the characteristics of the countryside. Walking in the fields in the morning and watching the villagers herding cattle and sheep is exhilarating; resting under the trees after class and after meals is leisurely and comfortable; the cool breeze carries us in the evening, looking up at the heavens and discussing with friends. This life is truly enviable!</p>
<p>I still remember when I was young and reading Selections of Ancient Prose, there were many articles describing scenery. The old teacher told us: "If an author can travel all over the world, deeply understand the meaning of what he sees and hears, and integrate it all, then his writing will surely have a magnificent spirit, a smooth style, a beautiful rhythm, and a solid structure, so that others will feel as if they are there when they read it." At the time, I didn't understand these words very much. However, after reading Weng Sen's "Four Seasons of Reading," and being able to read in this rural environment, I deeply realized that the words of the ancients and elders are true. As it says:</p>
<p>"Good birds on branches are also friends, fallen flowers on the water are all essays, what is the joy of reading like? Green fills the window, and the grass is not removed. After painting and chanting for a long time, cicadas chirp in the trees; late at night, the embers fall, and fireflies enter the curtain. The joy of reading is endless, and a melody on the Yaoqin brings a warm breeze. Yesterday, there was a sound of leaves in the courtyard; the bean flowers on the fence bloomed, and crickets chirped. The joy of reading is delightful; get up and play with the bright moon in the frosty sky. Sitting opposite the leather-bound books, the lamp moves on the wall; singing loudly in the middle of the night, the snow presses on the hut. Where can the joy of reading be found? A few plum blossoms mark the heart of the earth."</p>
<p>In just a few paragraphs, the different interests of reading in the four seasons are fully expressed. No wonder that in times of peace, scholars and literati loved to live in seclusion in the mountains and fields, quietly seeking this pleasure. Unfortunately, in these difficult times, this kind of life is no longer easily available.</p>
<p>Returning from summer vacation, I suddenly felt the urban noise and annoyance. I wrote this short article to remember it.</p>
<h3>Rambling on Neckties</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>People who wear suits have an inextricable connection with neckties. However, we rarely know the evolution of neckties.</p>
<p>It is said that the earliest ancestors to use neckties were the savages of the primitive era. They did not use neckties made of cloth or silk, but wore animal teeth and bones around their heads to show off their hunting skills.</p>
<p>The true founder of the necktie was the elegant Emperor Louis XIV, who happened to see a military officer wearing a white silk handkerchief around his neck. He thought it was admirable, so he copied it himself in a few days.</p>
<p>Later, the more he looked at it, the better he felt, so he simply gave it a name: "Cravat," and stipulated that it be a necessary decoration in the military uniform, and even formed a "Cravat" Imperial Guard.</p>
<p>One night, the "Cravat" army was fighting the British army, and the British army suddenly launched a night attack. The "Cravat" army was awakened from their dreams and hurriedly put on their uniforms. However, the "Cravat" neckwear was very time-consuming. What to do? In desperation, everyone came up with a quick idea: they used the rings in their hands to fasten the "Cravat" in front of their chests. So, when they returned to Paris, the "Cravat" had a new design.</p>
<p>After the American and French Revolutions, neckties officially gained status and became a necessary decoration for young men in general. They also began to use textiles of various bright colors as neckties.</p>
<p>However, the usage at that time was very clumsy. They only knew how to tie the knot, but didn't know how to remove it. Therefore, each necktie could only be used once, and at night, they would cut it off with scissors.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, "low collars" began to be worn, so the style of neckties also changed. For a period of time, people loved to use knots. Today, the necktie has developed to its peak. When you walk into a department store or a large company, you can see colorful and dazzling new neckties hanging on the shelves. Many young people have really put in a lot of effort in the selection and application of neckties, in order to show off their skills in love affairs.</p>
<h3>Ode to Summer Slumber</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>The summer vacation is two or three months long, which cannot be considered short. University students all have a set of ideals and a string of plans. Who doesn't want to do a lot in this summer vacation? It is said that Harvard University students like to travel around the country during the summer vacation to broaden their horizons; Moscow University students like to find a job during the summer vacation to enrich their experience; Cambridge University students like to read extensively during the summer vacation to enrich their knowledge. I think what they love is not what our Chinese university students love. Who doesn't love to travel? Summer jobs are exactly what they are seeking day and night. Extensive reading is entirely their long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about traveling around the country, but just going back to their hometown once is quite difficult. Many university students from Sichuan and Yunnan, looking at the millions of ship or plane ticket prices, either shake their heads and sigh, or their eyes spark with fire. Some people have spent a lot of effort and raised just enough travel expenses, but a sudden "adjustment" has turned their efforts into nothing. Some also think of strolling around other cities or going to the countryside, but the train prices have increased by 80%, and a meal outside costs 200,000 to 300,000, so how easy is it to stroll around! Furthermore, finding a summer job is even more difficult than climbing to the sky. This year, 60% of the graduates of national universities still lack a way out, who cares about you who haven't graduated? And even if you have the greatest good fortune, a short-term job is nothing more than a home tutor. There are quite a few university students who, with full enthusiasm, have placed advertisements for "available for hire" in the newspaper, but have not been "hired" after three months. Furthermore, to read extensively, original books now cost 4 or 5 US dollars, which is over 10 million per book. Don't say "extensive" reading, even "carefully" reading "one book" is already difficult. Therefore, this summer vacation, it seems that it is still best to hold a cattail fan, take a high nap during the day, and enjoy the cool in the evening. On the one hand, it is to nourish the spirit, so that the mind can be broad and the body can be fat. On the other hand, it also conforms to the purpose of "the summer days are long, just right for sleeping."</p>
<h3>Quitting Smoking is Difficult</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Because the price of cigarettes is rising every day, even twice or three times a day, I quit smoking in anger. — It has been three days now. But at the same time, I haven't dared to go out for two days. Am I hiding from cigarette debts? No, I have always bought cigarettes with cash and have no habit of owing them. The reason I don't dare to go out is that I deeply believe in Lao Tzu's golden saying: "If you don't see what you desire, your heart will not be disturbed." Only I smoke in my family, so I don't feel too sad when I don't smoke at home. But as soon as I go out the door, the various green, red, white, and white signs in the cigarette shops are all my old and new friends. They are constantly greeting and signaling to me. It seems too inhumane to ignore them immediately, and I simply can't forget them. Even more so when I see people smoking heartily, perhaps some friends will say to me, "Why bother!" Maybe I will smoke again. I know my weaknesses very well, so I don't dare to take a step out the door.</p>
<p>After not smoking, I am not hungry or cold; but I still feel some indescribable discomfort. I have little interest in reading, and I can't write at all. Even the only bit of "leisurely interest" in a difficult life is swept away. All day long, I am dull and stiff, lonely and cool, and at a loss. It is said that a "Shanghai girl" can not eat, but she can't not smoke good cigarettes. The greatness of cigarettes can be seen from this. We, who妄想 to break away from cigarettes, feel too overestimating our abilities and simply asking for trouble. If I don't smoke, I can't write articles, and of course there will be no稿費, and I feel that it is not worth the loss.供奉烟霞 is perhaps a奇福 in the world. So I want to smoke again. I am preparing to buy a kind of native烟, called "Zhuguan", which is very refined. It is said that the price is much cheaper than cigarettes. I will also take out my grandmother's water烟筒 and tidy it up. Holding it in my hand, it has an ancient charm. If I smoke机筒, my thoughts will naturally flow like a torrent, and I will also gain the good name of loving domestic products, killing two birds with one stone, isn't that great? At the same time, I also experienced the flavor of my grandmother's era, the "leisurely interest" of which is more than smoking cigarettes.</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Hans</p>
<p>The largest commodity that Australia exports to the United States is wool, followed by rabbit skins. According to statistics, the value of rabbit skins that Australia exported to the United States last year reached a whopping 10 million US dollars.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are currently 632,667 salesmen (who travel around selling goods) in the United States, of whom women account for about 2%.</p>
<p>The fastest "escalator" (like the one in Shanghai's Daxin Company) in the world is in New York's Rockefeller Center, which can rise 125 feet per minute.</p>
<h3>Huangpi (Clausena lansium)</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>There is an old saying in eastern Guangdong: "Eat lychees when hungry, and huangpi when full." Among the southern fruits that are rich in juice, lychee is the best. Other fruits cannot be eaten much, but this fruit is an exception. Eating 300 a day is not too much, and eating them every day is not harmful. It can relieve hunger, which is a great virtue, so it should be ranked among staple foods, not just appreciated for its beautiful fragrance. After the lychees are gone, huangpi takes their place. It is sweet and sour, and the skin has a strong fragrance. It can regulate Qi and aid digestion. It can be preserved for a long time by pickling it in salt water and licorice juice and drying it in the sun. Those who are surfeited with wine and meat can chew a few, and they will immediately feel refreshed. Or it can be cooked with syrup, and the taste is even more precious. Westerners love it no less than candy. Occasionally, I checked ordinary English and American dictionaries and didn't find the word "lychee," but I found "huangpi," which is slightly inaccurate. A half-foreign dictionary notes its etymology, which is exactly taken from the pronunciation of our country. This thing is also produced in East India, and the British use a word made by our country to make this word, but I don't know why. English dictionaries also have "扁桃" [almond], which is also a word made by taking the pronunciation of Guangdong and Guangxi. 扁桃 is like mango but smaller, and the taste is sour and unpalatable, but it is good to stir-fry with meat. "Mango" is an Indian word.</p>
<h3>Rhyming with Qian Mocun</h3>
<p>— Qiao Dazhuang</p>
<p>A traveler's clothes lit by a silver lamp in an inn, a long journey – are you a hero or not? The world speaks of a noble scholar's prose from Suzhou, the wind sends a light carriage returning from the sea. Standing alone, among a thousand, is slightly different, Heaven permits a low flight. Wanting to seek the calligraphic texts in the stone chamber, a white-haired rendezvous may not succeed.</p>
<p>This poem was mailed from Nanjing on June 27th, only six days before Mr. Qiao's suicide, and is probably his last poem. After the poem are the eight characters "First try with famous ink, the paper is a bit poor." -- Editor</p>
<h3>The Bridesmaid's Dress</h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>The bridesmaid's dress is often very similar to the bride's dress. It is said that the origin of this custom is as follows:</p>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, many people had a superstition that when a person reaches the peak of happiness, he or she is often envied by demons or monsters, which leads to extreme joy turning into sorrow, and unfortunate events occurring. Making the bridesmaid's dress similar to the bride's dress during the wedding ceremony can deceive the eyes of demons or monsters, and unfortunate events can be avoided.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>I recently saw in the "Pingjin Daily" a report from Nanjing that "Cao Yuanbi, an old Hanlin scholar from Suzhou, at the age of eighty-two, married an unmarried woman of fifty-six years old through a friend's introduction. The wedding ceremony took place on July 4th, with red candles illuminating the scene, becoming a celebrated story. This is believed to be an unprecedented tale, even more remarkable than the union of Xiong Xiling and Miss Mao twenty-four years ago. At that time, Xiong Xiling was sixty-six years old, and Miss Mao was thirty-three, half the age of her husband. Now, Old Man Cao is at an advanced age, surpassing the 'approaching seventy' age of Old Man Xiong back then, and this old bride is also more than twenty years older than Mrs. Xiong Mao at the time of her marriage. It can be seen that times are changing day by day, and legendary and strange news is emerging endlessly."</p>
<p>When Xiong and Mao married, it was widely said that the "old Hanlin scholar" was vigorous in his old age. Now, Mr. Cao is also called "old Hanlin scholar." Other elderly people with past imperial examination degrees, such as Chen Xiaoshi, who lives in Shanghai, and the late Huang Shoujing, who lived in Pingjin, are also often referred to as "old Hanlin scholars." It seems that people generally misunderstand "Hanlin" as a common term for reputable veterans of the imperial examination, but they do not know that "Hanlin" has a specific definition, just like the academic qualifications of students studying abroad, which also have varying degrees of depth. One cannot simply call everyone who returns from Europe and America a Doctor of Philosophy. Furthermore, one must know that the "Hanlin Academy" is a government office with various officials who are responsible for literary service and writing, while the "Censorate" is responsible for investigating and impeaching officials, just like the current five Yuans, each with its own responsibilities. A Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examination) who does not enter the Hanlin Academy is not a Hanlin, just as a Doctor of Law who is not elected to the Legislative Yuan cannot be considered a legislator. Once such a comparison is considered, a clear understanding of what constitutes a "Hanlin" can be obtained.</p>
<p>This "eighty-two" year old groom, Cao Yuanbi, was a Jinshi of the Yiwei year (Qing Guangxu 21st year, the same year as Kang Youwei), a secretary of the Grand Secretariat, known for his erudition and skill in writing, textual research, epigraphy, and bibliography, and was respected by famous officials and dignitaries of the time. However, he did not enter the Hanlin Academy, so he is not a Hanlin. Furthermore, Chen Xiaoshi was a Jinshi of the Bingxu year of Guangxu 12th year and a Juren of the Yihai year (Guangxu 1st year). In the 24th year of the Republic of China (Yihai), he celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of his provincial examination success, and the year before last (the 35th year of the Republic of China, Bingxu), he also celebrated the reunion of the palace examination results. Not only are his imperial examination achievements a topic of conversation, but he is also a person of great longevity. However, he was appointed as a principal from the Jinshi degree, and his government office was the Ministry of War, not the Hanlin. Furthermore, Tang Weizhi (Wenzhi), who once served as a Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and Acting Minister, was a Jinshi of the Renxu year, and had an excellent political and literary status, but after becoming a Jinshi, he was a Principal of the Ministry of Revenue, also not a Hanlin. Cai Yuanpei was also a Jinshi of the Renxu year (passed the provincial examination in the Gengyin year and took the palace examination in the Renxu year), and was a classmate of Tang. Cai was changed from Jinshi to Shujishi and entered the Hanlin Academy, and in the Jiawu year was appointed as an editor, which makes him an undoubtedly old Hanlin.</p>
