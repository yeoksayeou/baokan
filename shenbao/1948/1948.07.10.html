<p>〔中央社北平九日電〕東北學生聚衆搗毀平市參議會事件，因奸匪職業學生之操縱煽動，今已變質演出超出法令範圍之行動。北平國私立院校北大，淸華，燕大，師院，中法，鐵路學院，朝陽，華北學院，藝專等九單位學生自治會及少數「職業學生」利用七五市參議事件爲藉Ｋ２，煽動各院校堅坐及東北流亡來平學生約四千人，於九日晨十時許陸續集合北長街李副總統官邸請願，於集中北長街之途中沿路書刋標語詆辱　方首長，呼喊反動口號，其重要及普遍者爲「請嚴懲兇手傳作義」，「以血還血」，「槍斃兇　傳作義」「槍斃陳繼承」「還我十七烈士的血來」「反對政府剿民政策」等，在李副總統官邸請願時，係以「疲勞轟炸」之方式，由所謂「學生代表」分批進　副總統，此去彼來曉曉不休，卒至李副總統舌敝唇焦，不耐再談，乃勸令回校。彼等乃乘機要求集體回校，由副總統官邸所在地之北長街，出南長街東去，折往南池子·北池子返沙灘北大，以達其破壞臨時戒嚴命令變相遊行之目的，沿途用問答方式，此唱彼和。彼等於返校途中，即散放其預先印就之宣傳品「歡迎勝利歸來的戰士們」。由此種種，可以證明彼等今日之目的，意在破壞負華北剿匪指揮任務的傅總司令之聲譽。彼等向李副總統除口頭所提要求外，並提書面要求十項，其重要者爲「嚴懲傳作義」，無條件釋放「七五」慘案中被捕學生，「撤銷戒嚴令，並保證今後不得濫施戒嚴令，以剝奪人，民集會遊行請願的自由『。「立即設立臨大。臨中。收容所有東北來平公私立大中學生，並給予公費」，「厚恤死難同學家屬，負責傷者醫華費，死者治喪費」等項。午後五時「職業學生」復召開所謂「東北華北學生抗議七五慘案哀悼控訴大會」，至六時半許，大部學生對受操縱之表演已形不耐，乃分別結隊散去。今日終日警憲爲維護治安，出動者達千人，且均係徒手對學生自早至晚，抱定　不還口，打不還手之態度，紀律甚爲良好。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕立院第一會期第十八次會議，九日晨舉行，孫科主席，九時半開會，首通過上次會議紀錄，並決議將前政院咨請審議修正公證費用法條文案交民法委會審查。旋聽取宋述　報告程序委會檢討議事進程迂緩原因及所擬加强效率之辦法，楊一峯報吿隨社會部畏谷正綱飛作視察經過。楊氏述及開封戰役後果時，指出軍民生命財產物資損失慘重，然人心之損失尤値政府警惕，渠並强調搶救各地流亡靑年爲當前急務。楊氏報吿後，會衆無異議通過余拯等一百八十人及楊一峯等卅餘人所提慰問中原將士之臨時動議兩件，決定（一）致電慰勉中原會戰剿匪獲捷國軍陸空全體將士，（二）全體委員各捐獻日日所得，慰卹陣亡將士遺族，並以慰勞品交該院軍民慰問團携往前綫散發。（三）咨國防部查明勛績特著之將士，予以嘉獎。</p>

<h3 id="c25">社論　貴賤與有無 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>蔬菜漲價，影響到每一個人的生活，其威脅民生，刺激漲風，斷不在柴米油鹽等日用必需品之下，而當局對於此等物價，從不施以何等之管制或干涉。這並不是當局有憲忽略了這一點，實以此等農產，來自四郊，又難久廠，如果打草驚蛇，過於干涉，一般菜販，必將聞而裏足，則來源頓减，愈足以激動漲風。每値風雨連朝，或冰雪載途之際，蔬菜市價，無不立時暴漲，這就可證明供應數量與市價關係密切之一斑。</p>
<p>其餘一切貨物，以生產，儲藏，販運等較爲固定，其出入進退，自不若蔬菜之敏感。但商人趨利，何所不至，凡利潤較厚之處，其吸引力自必最强，又供給减少，需要不退，則價格上漲，亦屬供求律自然之　則。故欲抑平物價，其道雖有多端，而疏導來貨，充厚存底，實爲不易的辦法。現在增加生產，爲舉國一致的要求，而美援物資源源東來，亦予人以莫大的興奮；究其所以，無非爲供應較充，物價域可平落而已。</p>
<p>上海以工商發達，交通便利，儼然爲我國之貨倉。其存貨之多寡，與來源之衰旺，不特爲一市經濟命脈之所關。實亦足爲全國經濟指標。往昔上海淪陷時期，敵偽嚴密統制，實施封鎖，其目的雖在强取豪奪，佔爲己用，而不許浪竭資源，輕易宣洩，亦未嘗沒有經濟的作用。現在食衆產寡，蓋藏日稀，工廠紛紛停閉，减工解雇，比比皆是，而商家又同聲嘆息，認爲賣了出去，便不易補得進來。照此情形，縱沒有人爲的方法，加以疏散與外流，恐怕日積月久，亦將有無貨可囤，無物可存的日子。</p>
<p>我們並不否譯囤風的熾烈，亦不否認囤商之推波助瀾，抬高物價，但在普徧配給與有效管制尙未能實施的我國，尤其是通貨膨脹尙無法制止的時候，要想僅憑幾紙公文，幾聲檢查，就能消滅投機，杜絕囤積，恐怕過於理想。而况在羣情惶駭，風聲緊迫，存底愈枯，人心虛弱的時候，這種希望，恐怕更形渺茫。不看見某種貨物勢將斷檔的時候，當局照例要作若干宣傳，說是某批貨物某種船隻即將到埠嗎？本市米糧，不許運往他處的禁令，不是現尙繼續有效嗎？他如紗布外運之忽禁忽放，食油麵粉之限制轉中，諸如此類，如果不爲保持存貨，先供本市之應用，究竟爲的是什麼？究極言之，這些功令，不是好像在有意無意之間，却又在鼓勵本市貨物的多多儲備囤積嗎？</p>
<p>有人以爲存貨太久，無異壟斷，自然應該加以取締，以平市面，這話原是不錯，不過所謂存貨，其種類與原因，亦至爲複雜。有確係故意囤積，希圖居奇的；也有無法遝銷，被迫呆擱的（如水泥，機器等）；有時令未到，只得株守的（如皮貨，汽水，炭酸鈣等）；有專銷某地某國的貨品，以某種原因，無法運往的（如許多出口貨）；還有欠款抵押等關係，不容易迅速處理的。如果硬性規定，超過一定期間，即作囤積居奇論，來一個斷然處置，這與市塲習慣，未免過於扞格了吧。</p>
<p>也有人以爲商家存貨太多，即是囤積居奇，非加以嚴格限制，不足以調劑盈虛，穩定市價。這在理論上亦頗持之有故。所困難的，是這項限制，究應如何規定。若照部令所定，以一年營業量爲準，定爲幾分之幾，超過此數，便算囤積，也未免過於膠柱鼓瑟了。因爲營集有盛衰，資力有大小，經理　亦各右其魄力與手面，同是一家工廠或商號，在去年只做　偉生意的，今年何嘗不可續充爲五百億或千億？只須買賣正當，不作非法生意，政府似乎不應該强迫商人，不許其擴充營業。又况新開設的公司行廠，過去尙無營業，又將以何種數額爲標準？</p>
<p>更有人以爲借了錢來，購貨堆存，或更輾轉抵押，更番購買，總不能不予以取結。不知買賤買賣，原是經商的惟一原則，這在國營機構，甚至政府管制機構，此例亦觸目皆是，何獨苛責於商人？况在物資稀少，補進爲難的時候，儘量辦進原料，辦貨抵充，亦不能不說他是自衛的正當辦法。至於借錢購貨，以貨抵債，在商界尤屬常事。各種法令，也從沒有營運資金只限於已繳股本的規定。如果嚴格限制，不許商人借款辦貨，則如許商業金融機構，又將何所事事？以何種生意爲貸款之對象？</p>
<p>總而言之，限制堆存，淸查囤貨，其用意原亦無可厚非，在雷厲風行，切實檢查的時候，囤貨亦可能紛紛出籠，暫收壓平市價於一時之效。不過利弊往往參半，執行技術尤成問題，等到宣洩太多，存底薄弱，或限制過嚴，來貨稀少之後，依照蔬菜市塲的例子，能否遏住漲風，免除物稀爲貴的現象，似乎總是疑問。何況游資依然充斥，國家行局差出數額不在少數，那些握有大量法幣的人，不又是可以乘着物價稍平的時候大量買進嗎？那麼囤貨仍是囤貨，所不同者或只是換了新囤戶耳！而且，有貨可囤，其問題尙在價格之高下，到了無貨可囤，則其問題又超出價格之上了。右人說得好：貴賤是一問題，右無又是一問題；而後者的嚴重性，或許更在前者之上。這話也似乎頗可玩味的。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平九日電〕李宗仁副總統九日單獨接見合衆社記者稱：中蘇兩國間現存之一切協定，如一九四五年之友好條約，大連旅順及長春鐵路協約，早因蘇聯本身之行動而廢止。</p>
<p>記者詢以對中蘇友好條約第三條，如兩國中任何一國被攻擊或遭受侵略時，兩國負有相互協助之義務之意見，李稱：「余甚至將懷疑該約是否載右此條，但即使有之，則必係僅指並限制於若干小區域如東北及西北者。余以爲蘇聯從未願意遵行條約條款對渠之義務，依余之意見，蘇聯即第一個在東北破壞該約者，僅此一事即足使中國消滅對蘇聯信守該約之軍事互助條款之信賴。」渠復稱：蘇聯可被認爲已破壞一切協定之一切條款之每一字每一句，蘇聯允許及保證所作之事從未有實現其義務之任何一點者。　「任何條約必須雙方信守，倘若一方面不實現其諾言，則另一方面自無履行條約之義務。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平九日電〕副總統李宗仁今日向外籍記者宣稱：目前華北局勢與三個月前大致相同，旣未改善亦未惡化。華北剿匪總司令傳作義屢向中央請撥新式兵器，今後三個月內料可獲得大批接濟。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市近又發生一件神秘失踪案件，內容甚爲曲折離奇。失踪者爲福建長樂人劉傳漙，二十七歲，國立廈門大學畢業生，現任交通部塘沽新港工程局工程員。失踪日期爲五月初旬，劉自戈登路塘沾工程局駐滬辦事處宿舍走出後，即不知去向。其兄傳澎，爲台灣省合作事業管理委員會督導，得訊後已趕來上海，其弟傳湛，就讀暨南大學，兩人現在各報刋登尋人廣告，一面向警察局江寗分局報案聲請偵查。</p>
<p>劉傳馮失踪之關鍵，起因於其夫婦問不辛之感情破裂。劉於三十二年問與同鄉女子帥範學院畢業生吳叔暉訂婚，至三十六年八月在滬結婚，婚後劉隻身北返塘沽工作，吳則留居滬上其堂兄吳傳之家中。自此兩地相思，難慰寂寥，吳對劉之感情漸生變易，終至提出離婚之要求。據劉兄傳澎所談，劉往塘沾工作後，數度擬携其妻北上，而吳以北方不寗爲詞固却不往。</p>
<p>身份證衣物金錢　臨行時絲毫未取</p>
<p>本年二月間劉曾來滬，而吳貿然返榕規避，劉不得已，又北返塘沽，迨四月中，其岳父六秧大慶，劉欲趁此回閩祝壽，而吳去電力阻·劉以其妻托辭北方多事不肯赴沽，爲謀家庭團聚，乃謀缺台灣，於四月底來滬。不料吳忽提出請求離婚，劉不允，五月四日雙方爭執時遂生衝突，劉痛毆其　，擊傷眼部，曾入中美醫院醫治。是晚劉仍返宿舍，據茶役所見，劉於次日上午八時半外出後，即一去不返，而其身份證履歷證件及衣物金錢等，均存於室內絲毫未帶。惟其岳父五月四日在福州接告急電報，於六日來滬，據云五月七日上午十時猶至宿舍邀劉同來相晤，後劉云出外找請律師，自此即告失踪。然則劉究於何時失踪，遂成爲一謎。</p>
<p>疑爲謀害</p>
<p>其兄傳澎認爲劉身邊金錢證件既絲毫未帶，自非遠行，倘屬自殺，何以警局旅館江河之間均未發現其屍跡，亦未留有遺書，故疑係被害，而謀害者爲誰，渠指控係弟婦「另有所戀」，因離異不遂，且被毆打，遂懷恨成仇，幕後必有策動之人。渠指出何以劉失蹤之後，吳不即時呈報警察局或登報尋找，又何以不於出事之日即電知傳澎，而直至五月十五日劉岳父返閩之後，始函約往談約略通知。　劉妻吳叔暉，記者昨訪之於其寄母家中。吳熊度鎮靜沉著，渠稱與劉之感情破裂，並非自分離兩地後開始。當初吳與劉之兄嫂係屬同學，因此而雙方認識，是時吳尚年幼，其父對劉甚爲中意，故認識不過十日即行訂婚，俟結婚後，吳即感到劉性情固執專橫，加之又遠走北方，吳覺得「如結婚僅是爲了吃飯，那不結婚也可找事做」，所以「還是離婚的好」。</p>
<p>兩度傳訊　不得要領</p>
<p>二月中劉來滬時，吳即提出離婚，當時劉曾同意並親書字條一紙，內有「雙方意見不合，勢難偕老，自即日起無條件離婚，是後吳一切行動，本人不予干涉」等語。（此字條現爲劉兄視爲疑點之一，因文末未塡日期，印章下加　　印，證明人項下塡寫後又用墨塗去。）記者詢以何以劉在二月中同意離婚，而此次來滬，則又與吳爭執甚至毆打，吳答稱，亦不知其中道理。又稱，劉從不告其親戚朋友所在，失蹤後以爲其住至朋友家中，故不急於找尋。記者詢以今劉已失蹤，是吾感到傷心。吳稱，在下落未明瞭前，感情用事，亦屬多餘。並稱劉或者遠走外埠，今其兄弟等在報上所登廣告，涉及其本人之處頗多不台云。</p>
<p>現此案由江寗警分局承辦，曾傳吳叔暉及工程局宿舍茶役徐致山訊問兩次，均不得要領，一時恐尚難於破案也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市公用局公共交通公司，售票司機一九七人因留職停薪引起之罷工風潮，發展至昨晨三時許，由極度惡化狀態，急轉直下。工人接受趙曾珏局長之勸告，撤離公平路該公司員工福利會，詳情已誌昨日本報。晨六時各綫汽軍相繼出廠行駛，雖九路·十路兩綫於十時許一度中輟，惟經公可當局勸告後旋即恢復，至下午各綫車輛已完全恢復正常。</p>
<p>至於解僱之司機售票，公司方面曾決定兩項辦法：（一）願意接受留職停薪者，發給遣散費二個月，依六月份生活指數計算，七月一日至七日之獎金照算給付。（二）公司對工人所提出老工人侮月放棄升工兩天貼補新工人之辦法，在原則上表示接受，但必須全體老工人簽名保證，限三日內完成。新老工人昨日分別展開簽名工作，但願意接受留職停薪者已有一四十餘人，今日將辦理領款等手績。老工人放棄兩日升工之簽名，並不順利，老工人內部意見頗不一致，願簽名者寥寥，一部份被解僱新工人亦表示不願以彼等少數人問題而使全體老工人减少收益，預料今日願意接受遣散者將佔大多數。據趙局　談稱：若今後汽油來源獲得解決，公司計劃新闢之十六路十八路兩綫實現，則該批司機售票即可招回，繼續予以工作。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市雜誌界爲抗議郵局航空郵資增加辦法中對國內新聞紙部份不合理之措置，昨假淸華同學會招待記者，沉痛指出目前雜誌界遭受種種困難，幾瀕絕境，此次航空郵資加價後，新聞紙郵費爲普通信件之一倍，即每二十公分，自一萬元增至六萬元，依此規定，航寄一本雜誌即須付郵資十二萬元，實已超過雜誌本身售價，是則無疑爲讀者增加重大負祖，亦爲今後維誌界之一大打擊，爲抗議計，決定三項辦法如下：（一）推派代表二人，晋京向有關當局請願。（四）四十六種雜誌，聯名發表抗議宣言。（三）十六種周刋及半月刋，決自即日起，停刊一期以示抗議。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕昨據本市郵政管理局負責人談稱。此次提高航空郵費，係根據航空公司調整運費而來，郵局完全處於被動地位。以前航空公司向郵局收取遝費，信函印刷物完全一律，至於躉寄新聞紙類，則比照航空岡書小包優待辦法六折收費。此次航空公司漲價，除普加運費百分之一百八十外，並將基數調整，印刷品較信函加一倍（優待新聞紙類辦法仍舊），故郵局對印刷品之航空郵費不得不酌予提高。至於二十公分以下按信函收費，超過二十公分按圖書小包收費之辦法，早經取銷，並不適用云。</p>

<h3 id="c101">川康邊區　清剿黑夷 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　歐陽醇</p>
<p>〔本報重慶六日航訊〕生長峨邊的甘雨古木干兒（全名），是位川康邊境無人不知的黑夷。健壯精敏，行動謹愼，跟隨他身邊以侍從經常保持著五六十枝人槍，每至一地，嚴密警戒，不在任何地點多逗留。劉專員率領部隊同他打了半年仗，到今天還沒個官兵曾照見木千兒的人影。這位僅紙二十四歲的</p>
<p>黑夷領袖在去年底，已經私人擁有步槍八十餘發，輕機槍四挺及木家營，粽子山一帮八百餘夷娃，八百枝步槍，百餘籍子彈，一有變故，還能號召大凉山夷人槍四百餘應援。（註一）川西遭受木干兒騷擾的有樂山，峨嵋，沐川，峨邊，馬邊等五縣，因爲木千兒歷年來强種烟苗，收納亡命，影嚮川西南及川康邊區的治安至鉅。夷人擅長爬山，可以各自爲戰，耐寒持久，又不需要補給，射擊技能嫻熟。所以，在劉專員急電呈報行轅前，木千兒已經佔了峨邊鴉鴉溪，花秋糟，茶園，大火地，老鷹岩，張家山，木家營，迄團岩邊緣，另外竄踞了石碑崗，金巖溪，白臘坪，石笋坪一帶。據參加戰役者談稱：夷區所有要口據點，均築有掩護工事，非小型砲能够破壞。部隊亦有營，連，排的編成，一部份還穿有軍服。</p>
<p>四川省政府動員了省保一總隊第一·三兩大隊，五區保安警察大隊，峨邊縣鄉村警察大隊，樂山，沐川縣警察中隊，阿牛自新夷兵等。</p>
<p>會同進剿並利用林塲子墾殖合作社（註二）及周澤，印鴻鈞（註三）的力量，才平定了木干兒的事變，茲抄錄當時總指揮劉仁庵的報告，以窺戰役的經過：</p>
<p>「指揮部設於沙坪，兵力分三路。中路以省保安第一總隊長李龍爲指揮官，兵力約六中隊。左翼五區保安大隊長金安仁指揮，約五中隊。右翼峨邊縣長何正明率領二中隊。匪憑險頑抗，經激烈戰鬥後，夷人不支退却，中路先後佔鴉鴉溪，黃蓮崗，岩窩子，米家山。左翼佔獅子岩，張家山，木家營，柱頭山，老鷹岩，右翼因地形惡劣，斷崖絕壁，原始森林，行動困難，兼又零度以下，積雪數尺，於最後仍佔新店子，黑山溝，石笋坪等地。惟以省保安隊因解決冬季棉服及運糧，延期進攻時，氣候激變，冰雪遍野，木干兒得乘機逃脫（註四）。嗣後有白夷百餘家派代表馬福華等向我投誠，自願繳步槍，全役計共斃匪首四，匪從五十，傷匪徒五十，俘匪首一，匪徒一三一，自新匪首五，匪徒七百。我陳亡官二，兵一七，傷官七，兵四三，失踪兵二。」</p>
<p>目前，峨邊投誠夷人已整編成保，自動</p>
<p>剷盡煙苗，永不種烟。據川省主席王陵基向重慶綏署報稱：「何正明縣長已深入夷區，督導查剷，同時召集白夷代表馬福華，脚肚兒，牛牛兒，大漢子等十餘人盡力設法穴化。現收復地區已由軾保警大隊在長梯，鴉鴉溪，毛坪等地各留駐一個中隊，以資鎮懾。又於大火地夷區成立懷德鄉，委毛坪士紳黃雲昇爲鄉長，建築　堡，編組保甲，增產糧食，登記夷槍等善後。而在劉仁庵專員的專案請求中，朱紹良主任又在四日派了閔賢邨科長飛蓉轉赴峨邊，查勘木千兒收復區的善後辦理事宜。</p>
<p>四個註釋（一）由大凉山赴峨邊木干兒夷區係經藥子山，大足壩路綫。（二）林壩子墾植合作社爲峨邊新設之合作組織，全力控制太干見以外之夷人，幷率周澤，印鴻鈞等效命，促成全面淸剿勝利因素，幷以該社爲全區最優墾植機構。（三）周澤，印鴻鈞原係木干兒同夥，後參加淸剿，戴罪立功。（四）木干兒逃竄，峨邊縣長兼右翼指揮官何正明記大過一次，理由爲指揮不力，縣府電台長賴開禮亦因「通訊遲緩，延誤作戰」，遭受申斥。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕連日物價略見穩定，日用品價格雖見上漲，爲勢尚緩，但至昨日，則日用品及金融性商品行情，又見全面上漲。國家行局昨日共差出顯寸一萬億以上，而各地游資又絡續來滬，致市面銀根鬆弛；兼以大鈔發行之謠言，流傳市面，更具刺激人心之作用·米糧棉紗棉布等布價，平均漲一二成以上，華股亦買氣甚旺，價格上揚一成二成不等。以昨日之物價情形言，除非當局能早採有效措施，吾則又將發生漲風。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日物價全面回漲，市面傳佈大鈔即將發行消息，對人心頗多刺激，銀錢業方面且認爲市面現鈔需要孔急，國行庫存不足應付，大鈔非發不可，且爲期極近。惟據央行柴務局陳副局長表示：央行迄未奉到發行命令，外傳種種，完全不確。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日本市銀根走勢鬆濫，市塲暗息步降，物價漲風頗劇，四行兩局一庫於銀錢業票據交換中，有鉅額差出，總計一〇四五一億。就中中央銀行差出九七億，中國銀行差出八一六六億，交通銀行差進八三九億，農民銀行差出二四六一億，中信局差出四〇六億，郵匯局差出四八三億，中央合作金庫差進三二三億，商業行莊大交換差進一〇二七六億，小交換差出五四〇〇億，外商銀行共計差進五五七五億。據聞昨日中國銀行之大最差出，係付出外埠匯滬款項所致。</p>

<p>食米因無錫產地價格不斷報漲，剌激殊深，人心激昻，價格再漲，然而限價如故，是以塲內交易更見寥落，僅有次等秈米尚在限價內成交。白粳及薄稻塲外均做二千三百五十萬，中貨二千三百萬，早稻亦達二千二百萬元，高羊供應很少，價亦達二千三百五十萬，各較上日升一百五十萬，二市到貨五五四一石。</p>

<p>雜糧價格上漲，惟恐當局之干涉，故貨主觀望不敢開價，因此交易寥寥，曾由同業提議乍豆定一千一百五十萬，車豆一千二百五十萬，惟未經核准前，仍未能貿然交易，故未開出。僅開篆豆·蠶豆·及少數之杜豆·靑豆·計菉豆升一百萬，蠶豆加五十萬，芝蔴及生仁均無交易。</p>
<p>食油因格於限價，不能漲價，然市勢緊俏非凡，無人肯以限價脫售，以致交易不決。後由同業擬具最低之成本，淨生油爲六千七百萬，豆汕爲四千九百萬，但須呈市長核准，故昨不及按此價開出，而仍告停頓未開。僅有吉桶小車蔴油，以六千五百萬成交，計漲四百五十萬，次售桶熟菜油四千五百萬，淨熟菜油四千三百萬，豆餅早市有五月份餅五百片，以四百八十萬開出，後市不開。</p>

<p>（甲）報告事項首由主席郝更生報告組織全國網球委員會之意義，略稱：本人根據理事會之決議，與全國體育協會理事長王正廷數次接洽，認爲欲復興我國體育，提高各項運動技術水準，必須訓練靑年人才，故對於各種運動，應有全國性之獨立組織，在全國體育協會管轄之下，專門負責各部門之提倡，推進工作。目前計劃，擬先組織綱球，足球，籃球，全國性機構，尤以網球方面，因得趙敏恒先生之極力籌劃，並得在座各位之熱烈贊助，將最先成立，本人最近赴南洋各地考察，華僑方面，亦極贊同。今日之會，即爲全國網球委員會第一次籌備會議，亦即成立會議，此爲我國體育界之一件大事。足球籃球組織將由本人出席世運會返歸後，再行籌組。至於委負人選，在徵得諸位同意後，即由全國體育協會分函聘請，其他單位之人選，將來陸續再行添聘，希望該會成立後，一面注意國際性之網球比賽及聯繫，一面注重全國性之網球比賽及推進事宜，尤應著重訓練靑年，希望十年後，中國選手能在台維斯盃賽中得達決賽權，謝謝諸位的光臨與帮忙。</p>

<p>一·校史</p>
<p>〔本報特訪〕復旦大學前身係震且學院，於民國紀元前九年春季，爲馬相伯氏所手創。時借徐家匯天文台餘屋爲院舍，聘外籍教士祖任義務教授，馬氏自任監院：院內各部事務，悉歸學生管理，養成自治之風。所定科目爲語文學·象數學，格物學·致知學四種，教學方法，一以啓發學生自由研究爲目的。越二年，春季開學，因學生繳匪問題，涉及外籍教授與學院發生權限衝突，致有學生散學之事。於是舍舊謀新，旋聞諸江督周馥，電飭滬道撥借款地，於吳淞提鎮行轉建臨時校舍，更校名爲復風；取恢復震且之義。當年秋八月，正式成立，馬氏自任校長，禮延李登輝博士總教務。由是震且學院蛻化而爲復旦公學，即今之復旦大學前身也。</p>
<p>後二年馬氏奉命赴日，嚴復繼任校長。迨辛亥光復，吳淞校舍爲淞軍佔用，公學中輟。民國肇始，馬氏與同學會合謀恢復復得滬都督陳英士之助，指撥徐家匯李公祠爲校舍，恢復開學。民二年，李登輝博士繼任校長，銳意革新。民六年改組爲大學，規模擴大，李氏乃親赴南洋各地，募集鉅款，在江灣陸續購地；至民九冬，鳩工興建，大學部遂於民十一年，由徐家匯選入。其李公祠原址，作爲中學部校舍。十三年由郭任遠代理校務，嗣十年間，校舍工程，相縱擴充，並經前北京教育部及前國府大學院先後批准立案。十八年按照部頒大學規程，設置文·理·法。商四學院。民二十五年，李校長以年老力衰，校董會給假休養；田錢新之·吳南軒二氏爲正副校長。二十六年抗戰軍興，談校與大夏火學聯合內遷開學，設第一部於廬山，第二部於貴陽，前者以該校爲主體，後者以大廈爲主體。詎廬山開學未　月，戰局突燮，寇禍益深，遂輾轉遷渝，暫借菜園壩復旦中學上課。翌年春三月，該校與大夏分立，賃廡重慶北碚黃桷鎮開學。於是設備簡陋，、教員缺乏，然師生情緒，益見踔厲奮發。是年徵購北殕夏壩土地四百餘畝，逐年大事興建，開　農塲，原爲一片荒凉野地，不旋踵而爲一巍峨之最高學府矣。師生研讀其間，陪都人士交相羨佩。民三十一年春，部令改爲國立。次年部派章益繼任校長，力圖改進，教學研究設備，積極擴充，建設與日俱增。其間新聞學系師生，協力籌建之新聞館，亦於三十四年春落成，尤爲新聞界人士所矚目。於是設備漸具，夾江而望，巍峨黌宇，鱗次櫛比，水流潺潺，弦歌盈耳，人文之盛，爲前所未有。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，該校復員東遷，除將江灣原校址收回。三十五年春，當局撥給校南敵產房屋多幢，以補不足，然尚不敷遠甚。先是該校內遷，仍在上海設立補習部，至是滬渝兩地員生，合於一堂，其編制與規模之擴大，遠駕昔年而上之。</p>
<p>二·現況</p>
<p>該校現有員生二千八百餘人，分設文，理，法，商，農五學院，共二十三系科組，茲分誌如下：（一）文學院：中文系，外文系，史地系，新聞系，教育系。（二）理學院：數理系，化學系，生物系（附設海洋組），土木工程系。（三）法學院：法律系（附設司法組），政治系，經濟系（附設經濟學研究所），社會系。（四）商學院：銀行系，會計系，統計系，合作系，統計專修科。（五）農學院：農藝系，園藝系，茶葉專修料。去年受農林部漁管處之委託，合辦高級漁業技術人員訓練班，另開補習組兩班（相當於以前之大學先修班），容納投考該校未經錄取而經甄別試驗之學生，於修業期滿一年後，如欲升入該校者，仍須參加新生考試。此外，教育部爲造就監獄管理人才，將於下學期在該校增設法院監獄官專修科，兩年畢業。</p>
<p>該校現在一心一志，設法提高學生程度，增進學術水準。去年投考者一萬二千餘人，佔全國不分區招生之第一位，今後該校決定重質不重量，新生錄取標準，亦將儘量提高。</p>
<p>今年暑期各院系均招考一年級男女新生，其中除教育系全部爲師範生待遇外，文學院之中文，外文，史地，理學院之數理，化學，生物各系，並招師範生十分之一。報名日期，八月一日至四日，考試日期，八月十日至十二日，另詳七月五日本報。</p>
<p>三·設備</p>
<p>該校設備，戰前已具規模，經西遝及敵僞佔領時期，損失頗重，迄今尚未恢復舊觀；中以圖書損失爲最，所幸前在後方已搜購一部份，現正匯合編目，勉可應用，惟距理想尚遠儀器方面農工兩院所必需之試驗儀器及試驗室，均大致敷用，其中金木工廠，農產品加工廠，均係新近建成。除此，另有經濟學研究所及新聞研究室，搜集有關資料甚豐，尤足稱道。</p>

<h3 id="c150">關於史達林 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>【編者按：凡關心第二次大戰史實者，莫不知有柴却里雅斯少將（Ellis　M．Zacharias）其人。柴氏爲戰時美國海軍部情報局副局長，極著功勳，本文爲共向杜魯門總統提供之情報，刋載於本年六月份「聯合國世界」雜誌。細研原文主旨，似係五月間蘇方公布美駐蘇大使司密斯氏與蘇外長莫洛托夫交換關於美蘇直接談判之文件後，對蘇聯局勢之一種分析。柴氏曾力言其情報來源絕對可靠，並建議杜史直接商談，以簽訂美蘇互不侵犯條約爲最後目標，並主張條約內美蘇應協議勢力範圍區域之劃分。惟以篇幅關係，若干部份已不得不加以刪略矣。】</p>
<p>一九四一年，美國故羅斯福總統的特使霍布金斯見到了史達林，回國後向總統報告說：「史達林就是蘇聯。假使我們想知道蘇聯將有什麼行動，如何行動，怎樣動手……都非直接見史達林本人不可。」</p>
<p>霍布金斯的話，到今日還是同樣的準確。史達林就是蘇聯，他沒有幕僚，也沒有什麼智囊團。左右的人雖多，却誰也不能影饗史達林的意志，即使莫浴托夫也不是例外。</p>
<p>但史達林本人却不願使外人知道一切事情都由他一人獨斷獨行。當前英國駐蘇大使克里浦斯爵士和他談起一德蘇互不侵犯協定」時，史達林指指坐在旁邊的莫浴托夫說：「你不要怪我。這是莫浴托夫的意思！」</p>
<p>事實上，史達林，羅斯福，邱吉爾三個人舉行各種會議時，羅邱雖然都帶了許多政治和軍事的顧問，史達林却隨從極少。雅爾達會議時，他的隨員較多，但他幾乎從不向他們徵求意見。祗有一次，他曾回頭向一位紅軍的將官談了短短幾句話，大家都極表驚異——但是，事實上祗是史達林請那位將官拿一杯茶給他而巳。</p>
<p>但蘇聯的共產黨政治局對史達林的影嚮却很大。據史達林以前雇用的一個秘書貝耶諾夫（Bayanov）說，「史達林在開會時從不發表意見，祗是注意地靜聽。等到大家發言完畢後，他才立起來說幾句話，而他的意見常被採納。」</p>
<p>史達林今年六十八歲了，他是一個精力極其充沛的人，不過在表面上不容易看出來。大戰期中雖備極辛勞，但精神仍舊極好。他有心臟病，據醫生們診斷，這病相當嚴重，但不一定致命。史達林嚴格遵從醫生的囑咐，正如他期望一切共產黨員絕對服從黨的決定一樣。史達林是決心要活下去的。</p>
<p>史達林決意要留下一個堅强而統一的蘇聯，所以，爲避免可能的混亂起見，他正在寫一部書？在這本書裏他將詳細地列舉他對黨政外交各部門事務的意見，留供他將來的繼承者參考。</p>
<p>史達林目前最關心的是從柏林到海參崴之間這一片蘇聯天地的安全。早在一九四五年雅爾達會議時，他就時時刻刻在提到戰後疆界問題。他在那時曾經說過：</p>
<p>如果一個國家想和另一國作戰，那麼它首先必定要找一個邊疆，務求越過了這邊疆便能抵達它所準備攻擊的國家。事實上侵略國常常會找到這種邊疆—有許多國家往往　意把這樣一個邊疆「借」給它。</p>
<p>〔杜魯門主義〕之實施，使他史覺得他的政治哲學已經得到了證實。但他也承認他自己的「史達林主義」已經趕在杜魯門的前面。所謂「史達林主義」，就是把蘇聯的界綫向西擴充到德國中部，東部延展到了千島羣島和北　三十八度以北的朝鮮。一直到一九四七年年底時爲止，史達林還以爲：各國對德國復興的恐　可以促成一種團結。可是到最近六個月中，他發現了自己的錯誤。各國所恐懼的倒不是德國，而是蘇聯本身了。</p>
<p>史達林目前對美國頗有戒心，因爲他疑心美國有侵略的企圖。但他堅信英美二國政府決不願現在就來一次戰爭。他認爲美國有三種人亟願再來造成一次世界大戰，這三種人是：（一）經濟界的領袖，也就是他所謂「資本家」，他們祗求擴展市塲，不惜採取任何手段；（二）軍人：史達林認爲軍人倒並不是特別喜歡打仗，而是願意造成緊張的局勢，以便動用大筆經費；（三）若干失意政客，想在另一次戰爭中找到專新上台的機會。</p>
<p>史達林自己對戰爭的態度如何呢？根據最可靠的情報，史達林的意思可分下列二點說明：（一）他深悉蘇維埃制度受不了一次新的戰爭的考騐（史氏對哈里曼氏語），所以地本人是決不曾直接采取侵略行動的；（二）但是，如果一旦被人攻擊，他決定動員一切人力物力，亳不留情的騙使全國參戰，永不投降。他曾說過：「即使打到那時我們已經一切都打光：沒有人，沒有武器，沒有軍火—我們的婦女也要提了沸水向侵略者潑去！」</p>

<p>南越志云，熙安間多颶風，颶者具四方之風也，常以五六月發，未至時雞犬爲之不嗚。嶺表錄，夏秋間有暈如虹者，調之颶母，必有颶風。閩粵瀕海地夏秋間時有颶風，大旋風也，每作歷時長短不定，且必具四方之風，如西風未至，勢雖稍殺，知其未竟也。颶風過後，必繼以滂沱大雨，至是始解嚴。至如見暈知風，又不徒嶺表爲然。廣州人颶至則曰打風，或曰打風颶，口語颶音稍訛，然非別有其字。英語之Typhoon，據牛津宇典，義即颶風，釋曰，中國各海之狂風，本於中國語之「大風」云。英語固有狂風·旋風等字，必取中國音製此一字，正合於名從主人之義。十餘年前，始於報紙上見一「颱」字，自愧無學，至今不審此字所從來。若調與台灣有關，科學界未必作是說。豈仿英語而特製者乎？誠然，則大可怪矣。</p>

<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>余在棲霞嶺妙智寺，侮日開窗見東南蔚然而深秀者，即玉皇山，亦稱育皇山。峯高而挺拔，常有烟雲繚繞其上，然西湖十景及錢塘八景中，皆不及之。友人木居士，常言山頂玉皇宮李道士紫東之能，所有全西湖道院，莫不統屬於玉皇宮之下，近處之金鼓洞葛仙庵，皆由玉皇宮派人主持，李通士蓋亦一奇人也。</p>
<p>余欲探訪玉皇山已久，一日由紫雲洞下山，向南入蘇隄，過六橋，步行約五里，隄上步花伴山二亭，皆稍坐。隄盡東行，抵淨慈寺，駐有隊伍，未入游。再進，有大石橋，過橋左轉，得一大道，石板齊整。邀道向迎面之山而行，兩面皆山，漸漸環抱，則玉皇山在望矣。中途有一亭，名曰望仙。休憩再進，未幾，即得玉皇山大道上昇，於入口處又有一亭，石級整齊，兩旁皆樹木暢茂，無日炙之苦，又得一亭，曰慈雲洞天，對面慈雲洞，轉折而上，道旁有碑，題曰潛雲洞。此兩洞皆未入。再上已高，窺見錢塘江，風帆歷歷，對江之火車蠕動，亦蜿蜓在目。距項已近，見一木牌，標明紫來洞由此入，乃先觀紫來洞。洞分三進，寬高如巨廈，第一進有茶座，可以坐茗。再入爲第二進，歷階而下，曠蕩無一物。再入爲第三進，仍歷階而下，亦復曠蕩無物，人云此係人工開闢，大而無當，作爲避彈窟，却甚佳也。然人工亦復大不易。第三進之後，則冥黑無光，以杖檮之，亦無階級，遂廢然而返。洞旁新築廣塲，建有高樓，窗明几淨，潔無纎塵，可稱避暑佳地，亦無高人逸士靜居，僅有一攝影店在其中耳。</p>
<p>紫來洞，原名飛龍洞，深窈莫測，傳與安徽歙縣諸山相通，未有左證。李紫東道士開闢後，更名爲紫來洞，以其名紫東，取紫氣東來之意，題名未免有烟火氣。出洞再上，有一亭甚廣，名曰七星亭。亭後置七星缸，缸係鐵鑄，高如人，周圍均有築書，缸內皆有水，原有七缸，今祗存其五。由七星亭再上，已達山頂，一路竹林茂密。入玉皇宮，大殿並不宏麗，後室頗精美，其高度出海面約二百公尺，不如南北兩高峯之高，但其峻挺則有過之。上山大道之樹木葱　，尤爲獨擅勝塲。</p>
<p>余不欲從原路下山，因由西面下。過一亭，名林海，西路遠不如東路之整齊，路旁亦無樹木，愈下愈荒落，遙見虎跑寺，以時間不及，未之往。達平地後，遂由汽車道至蘇隄，北行歸厲。</p>

<p>— 念新</p>
<p>前談「魯迅藏書」，並錄其出售一立齊閒談」之經過，本文則略述魯迅涉足書林之情形，則爲有關其「買書」者。</p>
<p>按魯迅所購各書，日文方面，多在內山書店，問有西洋名著，亦託該舖代訂者，則以魯迅與書舖主人，本屬至好，且時往舖中坐談也。至於綫裝書籍，凡屬商務書館印行者，皆託其介弟喬峯先生代購。舊槧古籍，則自往中區一帶書林市之，有時則驅摩託卡載返，可於其「日記」中稽焉。其中駐足之書店，以西藏路之中國書店爲數最多，（惟該店今已歇業）店中人今猶能津津道其購書之故事。據云魯迅於書籍之裝幀極注意，必擇其完皆致者，於書價則頗豪爽，不求折减，而對各書之版籍源流，皆甚熟悉。此自緣魯訊於我國舊學修養之深湛雄厚，故對版本極爲講究。「病後雜談」曾記其因欲得「吳興劉氏嘉業堂的新刻本」淸代禁書「安龍逸史」，不卹一再跋涉，而受盡該處閣者之氣，結果仍無所得。最後還是「託朋友去輾轉買來的」，因而有感於得書之艱，「好像必須是熟人或走熟一的書店，這才買得到」了。</p>
<p>然其間亦有無意中購得禁書者，如乾隆四十六年尹嘉銓「小學大全案」，亦爲淸初文字獄之一，而作爲此案媒孽之「小學大全」一書，即魯翁於「端午節前，在四馬路一帶閒逛，竟無意之間買到了一種，（指禁書—新註）曰「小學大全」，共五本，價七角，看這名目，是不大有人會歡迎的，然而，却是淸朝的禁書。」則與上述之購「安龍逸史」，其難易相距遠矣。</p>
<h3 id="c155">儲蓄 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>談起幣值問題，誰也不能保持止水般的心境，可是人心就是這樣的矛盾，紙幣愈是不值錢，保全幣值的心也愈切。目前，「儲蓄」兩個字雖然早已被人們丟在腦後，但是另一種變相的儲蓄，如購存容易脫手的日用品等，依舊存在。的確，有時一囤積」與「儲蓄物品」的分界綫，就很難說。如果以「儲蓄物品」作爲應付日後意外開支或臨時急需的一種手段的話，那也許可原諒的成分較多於可咒駡的成分吧。</p>
<p>在物價波動劇烈的時候，誰手中揑了紙幣，誰都有惶惶不能終日的感覺。我想這並不是本心如此，實由環境逼迫使然。記得在二星期前，敝友某甲得到一筆一千一百萬元的收入，轉請乙君設法，替他購買一些「隨便什麼東西」。乙君建議，所購物品宜求（一）易於售出，（二）價廉而數量多，及（三）上漲倍數較少者。經乙君考慮的結果，決替某甲代購草紙。過了幾天，某甲再去看乙君，乙君却因草紙價格巳上漲，改替某甲在S購了在戰前侮枚袛值幾文錢的「炭基」二千二百雙。事後使某甲差堪告慰而使收入不豐者認爲遺憾的是：現在的一千一百萬元，連這同一數量的「炭基」都買不到了。</p>
<p>從較技術的立塲看來，這種「儲蓄物品」的現象，自然也是一種病態的表現，大家紛趨於物品一途，超過正常供求關係，貨源將更形枯竭，愈買而愈貴，無異「作法自斃」。比較合理的辦法，或者可由當局設法獎勵各用戶購買各項生產工具，如給予折扣，或分期付款等。語云：「工欲善其事，必先利其器」，現在讓許多資力有限或略有積蓄的生產大衆，有了鋒利的「器」以後，當可增加生產的效率。這樣一來，個人的收入多了一條出路，對於疏導貨源，同樣也不無小補吧？</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th Dispatch] The battle for Yanzhou remains intense day and night. On the evening of the 8th, enemy New 8th, 9th, and 7th columns launched fierce attacks on the outskirts of the southwest city gates. However, due to the close cooperation of the defending troops with the air force, the enemy ultimately failed. When Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi flew over Yanzhou in a special plane on the morning of the 9th, he saw that the enemy was mostly entrenched within the five, six, seven, or eight li of fortifications surrounding the city, not daring to move. The soldiers and civilians inside the city were greatly encouraged by Commander-in-Chief Liu's personal visit to express his concern. In the past two weeks, the enemy's casualties in the siege of Yanzhou have reached more than 10,000.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th Dispatch] The National Army advancing from Jinan crossed Tai'an on the 8th and engaged the enemy's 13th Column more than ten li south of Tai'an. At this moment, the National Army on the Tai'an, Feicheng, and Pingyin lines and the National Army advancing north from Lincheng are launching a pincer attack from the north and south on the enemy forces surrounding Yanzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 9th Dispatch] Liu Zhi flew over Yanzhou at 8:00 AM today to supervise the battle, then flew to Jinan, and returned to Xuzhou at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th Dispatch] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang Jin, Secretary Liu Ziqing, and Chief of General Affairs Hu Fo, flew from Xuzhou to the skies over Yanzhou in a special plane at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 9th to express his regards to all the soldiers and civilians defending the city. The special plane arrived at 9:30 AM. Commander-in-Chief Liu immediately spoke with Commander Li Yutang via radio for five minutes, expressing great concern for all the soldiers and civilians who have been defending the isolated city for more than two weeks. Commander Li replied with an impassioned tone, saying, "As long as Li Yutang is here, Yanzhou will stand!" The special plane then dropped communication bags and a letter to all the soldiers and civilians in the city and flew north after circling the city three times. The soldiers and civilians throughout the city, witnessing the Commander-in-Chief's personal visit and learning that reinforcements were arriving soon, were all overjoyed and encouraged.</p>
<p>The original text of Liu's letter to the soldiers and civilians of Yanzhou is as follows: "Commander Li, Division Commander Huo, and all the soldiers and civilians of Yanzhou, this time when the enemy attacked, you bravely defended the city, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, and have earned the admiration of the entire nation. At the same time, more than 100,000 enemy troops in eastern Henan have been annihilated by our forces. The enemy's momentum is gone. Our army's deployment around Yanzhou has now been completed. I, the Commander-in-Chief, have personally come to inspect, and I hope that all our soldiers and civilians will closely cooperate in combat to achieve an internal and external pincer attack and achieve an unprecedented victory. Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression, Liu Zhi. Noon, Jia."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th Dispatch] After flying to Yanzhou to express his regards to the soldiers, Liu Zhi arrived in Jinan at 10:15 AM. He was greeted by Wang Yaowu and other senior officers at the Pacification Commissioner's Office. After a short rest, he immediately convened a military conference with various military leaders. At 1:40 PM, he met with our newspaper's reporter, and at 2:00 PM, he gave a speech to more than 400 military officers above the rank of colonel from various units in the Pacification Zone. Afterwards, he visited scenic spots around Daming Lake and Baotu Spring in the city, and at 3:30 PM, he returned to Xuzhou on the original plane.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Liu Zhi met with our newspaper's reporter at the Pacification Commissioner's Office here at 1:40 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. First, he stated that the reason why this total decisive battle in eastern Henan could achieve an unprecedented victory since the start of the suppression of the rebellion was due to the consistent hard work of all officers and soldiers. He especially emphasized that this spirit of working hard to the end has been his highest principle in serving and fighting since the Northern Expedition. The enemy concentrated the main force of ten columns, originally intending to eliminate our forces in a small encirclement, but unexpectedly fell into our large encirclement and was severely annihilated between Sui and Qi. This time, the enemy originally planned a decisive battle. If they had won, they would have taken advantage of the victory to advance south to the Yangtze River. If they had failed, they would have retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River to reorganize. Now, the National Army has not only made it impossible for them to cross the river, but also impossible for them to retreat and cross the river. I have now completed a thorough deployment to ensure that the remaining main forces of the bandits who fled to Caoxian and other places in southwestern Shandong are annihilated and lay the foundation for victory on the south bank of the Yellow River.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 9th Dispatch] Harvard University Professor John King Fairbank, a specialist on Chinese affairs, stated in his book "The United States and China" that the United States can help China achieve progress through economic and ideological assistance, without resorting to military aid.</p>
<p>Fairbank believes: "Our strategy must first maintain China's independence. Therefore, the second step must be to establish liberalism—individual freedom and individual protection—to counter the totalitarianism of a police state. Third, we must provide rapid and wise land reform and promotion through economic assistance to prevent peasant rebellions." "The long-term goal of American aid to China must be to modernize the lives of the Chinese people, enough to raise their living standards, thereby limiting their population growth."</p>

In addition to urgently telegraphing the Central Government for relief funds, it has now allocated 300 million yuan to be remitted to Huai'an to handle emergency relief. (3) According to the Suqing News Agency: The defending troops of Lianshui have made a strategic shift. The enemy forces harassing Shuyang and Siyang have been frustrated after the reinforced National Army launched a pincer attack from the north and south. Now, the cities of Shuyang and Siyang remain firm due to the combined defense of the National Army's land and air forces.

<p>The Statement That Kaifeng Was Razed to the Ground Is Not True</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, together with Henan elder statesman General Zhang Fang and legislator Yang Yifeng, jointly hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, issuing a written statement on their inspection of the bandit atmosphere and relief situation in Kaifeng, and making supplementary explanations verbally. When reporting on the Kaifeng disaster, all three emphasized that the rumors that "Kaifeng has been razed to the ground and that the casualties are in the tens of millions" are definitely not true. Zhang Fang, in his capacity as a native of Henan, said that the people of Henan have suffered greatly from the communist bandits and have suffered significant losses, but there are still some people who do not understand the truth and are using the sacrifices of the people of Henan to promote the communist bandits, and there are even people who are praising the communist bandits, which is truly an injustice to the people of Henan. Yang Yifeng also pointed out that the hypocrisy shown by the communist bandits after entering Kaifeng is actually propaganda, but their brutal nature is also naturally exposed. Yang also pointed out that the current difficulties encountered in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are: (1) shortage of food, (2) shortage of cash (when Kaifeng fell, the Central Bank had 1.1 trillion legal tender, all of which was robbed by the bandits), (3) commerce cannot be restored, (4) the supply of military grain and provisions is difficult to bear, (5) education is on the verge of bankruptcy, etc., and he hopes that public opinion will make more appeals.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Students in Beiping Petitioned Vice President Li; A Transgression of Legal Boundaries Occurred; Slogans of Sedition Were Shouted Along the Way, Fortunately Nothing Happened <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th Dispatch] The incident of students in the Northeast gathering and vandalizing the Beiping City Council has been manipulated and incited by spies and professional students, and has now taken on a different quality, resulting in actions that exceed the bounds of the law. Student unions from nine units of national and private universities in Beiping, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Teachers College, Sino-French University, Railway College, Chaoyang, North China College, and Art College, and a small number of "professional students" used the July 5 City Council incident as a pretext to incite approximately 4,000 students from various universities and exiled students from the Northeast to gather at Vice President Li's residence on Beichang Street around 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th to petition. On the way to gathering on Beichang Street, they posted slogans and publications denouncing local leaders and shouting seditious slogans. The most important and prevalent ones were "Please severely punish the murderer Fu Zuoyi," "Blood for blood," "Shoot the murderer Fu Zuoyi," "Shoot Chen Jicheng," "Give us back the blood of the seventeen martyrs," "Oppose the government's policy of suppressing the people," etc. When petitioning at Vice President Li's residence, they used a "fatigue bombardment" tactic, with so-called "student representatives" entering Vice President Li's residence in batches, coming and going, chattering incessantly, until Vice President Li was hoarse and could no longer bear to talk, and advised them to return to school. They then took the opportunity to demand to return to school collectively, from Beichang Street, where the Vice President's residence is located, heading east on Nanchang Street, turning towards Nanchizi and Beichizi to return to Sandan Peking University, in order to achieve their purpose of destroying the temporary martial law order and staging a disguised parade. Along the way, they used a question-and-answer format, chanting in unison. On their way back to school, they distributed their pre-printed propaganda "Welcome the victorious warriors returning." From all of this, it can be proved that their purpose today is to destroy the reputation of Commander-in-Chief Fu, who is responsible for directing the bandit suppression in North China. In addition to the oral requests made to Vice President Li, they also submitted ten written requests, the most important of which were "Severely punish Fu Zuoyi," unconditionally release the students arrested in the "July 5" tragedy, "Revoke the martial law order and guarantee that martial law will not be abused in the future, so as to deprive the people of freedom of assembly, demonstration, and petition," "Immediately establish Lintong University and Lintong Middle School to accommodate all the public and private university and middle school students from the Northeast in Beiping and provide them with public funding," "Provide generous pensions to the families of the deceased students and be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured and the funeral expenses of the deceased." In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, the "professional students" held a so-called "Northeast and North China Students Protest the July 5 Tragedy Memorial and Accusation Meeting." By 6:30 PM, most of the students had become impatient with the performance they were being manipulated into and dispersed in separate groups. Throughout the day, police and soldiers were mobilized to maintain order, numbering in the thousands, and all of them were unarmed, maintaining a "do not talk back when scolded, do not fight back when hit" attitude towards the students from morning to night. Discipline was very good.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The Eighteenth Meeting of the First Session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the morning of the 9th, chaired by Sun Ke. The meeting began at 9:30 a.m., first passing the minutes of the previous meeting and resolving to submit the draft amendment to the Notarization Fee Law, which was requested by the Executive Yuan for review, to the Civil Law Committee for review. Subsequently, Song Shu reported on the reasons for the slow progress of the Procedure Committee's review of the agenda and the proposed methods to strengthen efficiency. Yang Yifeng reported on his inspection with Gu Zhenggang, head of the Ministry of Social Affairs. While discussing the aftermath of the Kaifeng battle, Mr. Yang pointed out the heavy losses in life, property, materials, and resources suffered by the military and civilians. However, the loss of public morale deserves the government's attention. He also emphasized that rescuing the young people who have fled from various places is an urgent task at present. After Mr. Yang's report, the meeting unanimously passed two provisional motions proposed by Yu Zheng and 180 others, and Yang Yifeng and more than 30 others, to express condolences to the soldiers in the Central Plains, deciding on: (1) sending a telegram to express condolences to all the officers and soldiers of the National Army's land and air forces in the Central Plains campaign for their victory in suppressing bandits; (2) all committee members donating one day's income to support the families of fallen soldiers, and handing over the慰勞 goods to the Yuan's military and civilian慰問团 to take to the front lines for distribution; (3) requesting the Ministry of National Defense to investigate and commend soldiers with outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>Following this, the discussion on the report of the Legislative Committee's review of the Draft Supervisory Law began.

In addition, before adjourning the meeting, it was resolved to submit the 15 committee proposals listed on the agenda to the relevant committees for review according to the opinions of the Procedure Committee, including: (1) the public decision案 proposed by Du Guangxun and others to draft the organizational rules for each committee of the Supervisory Yuan; (2) the public decision案 proposed by Wang Lihang and others to complete the national banking system, requesting the purchase of the commercial shares of the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, and drafting an outline for amending the Central Bank Law and the regulations of the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank; (3) the public decision案 proposed by Jin Shaoxian and others to curb inflation, drafting methods to freeze issuance, balance the budget, and restore the pre-war living standards of public school teachers, and requesting that it be transferred to the Executive Yuan for strict implementation and set as a standard for budget review; (4) the proposal by Fan Yuansheng and others to implement the principle of land value increment to the public in important cities in accordance with Article 142 of the Constitution; (5) the proposal by Hua Youchen and others to request the government to establish a Central Financial Supervision Committee, with people familiar with finance from each province participating, to be responsible for determining the national agricultural and industrial loan policies and the amount of agricultural and industrial loans in each province, so as to avoid the current phenomenon of partiality; (6) the proposal by Pan Chaoying and others to request the government to announce the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, so as to correct international perception and distinguish right from wrong; (7) the proposal by Tang Ruyan and others to request that the Executive Yuan be instructed to order the Ministry of Transportation to immediately open up the private aviation transportation business to facilitate transportation and help quell the rebellion.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Editorial: High and Low Prices and Availability <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The rise in vegetable prices affects everyone's life. Its threat to people's livelihoods and stimulation of price increases are certainly no less than daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt. However, the authorities never impose any control or intervention on these prices. This is not because the authorities have overlooked this point. It is because these agricultural products come from the suburbs and are difficult to store for long periods. If the authorities take drastic action and interfere excessively, vegetable vendors will inevitably become alarmed and hide their goods, which will reduce the supply and further stimulate price increases. Whenever there are consecutive days of rain or snow, vegetable prices invariably skyrocket immediately. This proves that the relationship between supply and price is very close.</p>
<p>The production, storage, and transportation of other goods are relatively fixed, so their inflow and outflow are not as sensitive as vegetables. However, merchants pursue profits relentlessly. Places with higher profits will naturally have the strongest attraction. Furthermore, when supply decreases and demand does not decrease, prices will rise, which is a natural law of supply and demand. Therefore, to suppress prices, there are many ways, but smoothing the inflow of goods and increasing reserves are the most effective methods. At present, increasing production is a unanimous demand of the country, and the inflow of American aid materials also gives people great excitement. The reason for this is nothing more than to increase supply so that prices can fall.</p>
<p>Shanghai's developed industry and commerce and convenient transportation make it a de facto warehouse for China. The size of its inventory and the strength of its supply are not only related to the economic lifeline of the city but also serve as an economic indicator for the entire country. In the past, during the period when Shanghai was occupied, the enemy and puppets implemented strict controls and blockades. Although their purpose was to seize resources by force and take them for their own use, and not to allow resources to be exhausted and easily leaked, there was also an economic effect. Now, there are more mouths to feed than there is production, and storage is becoming increasingly scarce. Factories are closing down, reducing work hours, and laying off employees everywhere. Merchants are also sighing in unison, believing that once goods are sold, they will be difficult to replenish. Under these circumstances, even without artificial methods to disperse and drain resources, I am afraid that as time goes by, there will be days when there are no goods to hoard and nothing to store.</p>
<p>We do not deny the intensity of the hoarding trend, nor do we deny that hoarders are fueling price increases. However, in our country, where widespread rationing and effective controls have not yet been implemented, especially when inflation cannot be stopped, it may be too idealistic to think that speculation can be eliminated and hoarding can be stopped with just a few official documents and inspections. Moreover, when the public is panicked, rumors are rampant, reserves are increasingly depleted, and morale is low, this hope may be even more illusory. Don't the authorities routinely make some announcements when they see that a certain commodity is about to run out, saying that a certain batch of goods or a certain ship is about to arrive? Isn't the ban on transporting rice and grain from this city to other places still in effect? As for the sudden ban and release of cotton cloth for export, and the restrictions on edible oil and flour, what is the purpose of these measures if not to maintain inventory and first supply the needs of this city? Ultimately, don't these official orders seem to be encouraging the city to hoard as much goods as possible, intentionally or unintentionally?</p>
<p>Some people believe that storing goods for too long is tantamount to monopoly and should naturally be suppressed to stabilize the market. This is correct, but the types and reasons for storage are very complex. Some are definitely deliberate hoarding to speculate on prices; some are forced to sit idle because they cannot be sold (such as cement and machinery); some have to wait for the season (such as fur, soda, and calcium carbonate); some are goods that are sold exclusively to a certain place or country and cannot be transported due to some reason (such as many export goods); and there are also relationships such as outstanding debts and mortgages that are not easy to handle quickly. If it is rigidly stipulated that any goods exceeding a certain period will be considered hoarding and speculation, and a decisive disposal will be made, it would be too inconsistent with market practices.</p>
<p>Some people also believe that merchants have too much inventory, which is hoarding and speculation, and strict restrictions must be imposed to adjust surpluses and shortages and stabilize market prices. This is also quite justifiable in theory. The difficulty is how to stipulate this restriction. If it is based on the amount of business for one year, as stipulated by the ministry, and it is set as a fraction of that amount, and anything exceeding this amount is considered hoarding, it would be too rigid and out of touch with reality. Because businesses have their ups and downs, and their capital varies in size. Managers also have their own strengths and abilities. Even if it is the same factory or company, why can't it expand its business from only doing 偉 great business last year to 50 billion or 100 billion this year? As long as the business is legitimate and does not engage in illegal activities, the government should not force merchants to not expand their business. Moreover, for newly established companies and factories that have no past business, what amount should be used as the standard?</p>
<p>Still others believe that borrowing money to purchase goods and store them, or even mortgaging them repeatedly to buy more, should not be allowed without requiring a written agreement. However, buying low and selling high is the only principle of doing business. This is also often seen in state-owned institutions and even government-controlled institutions. Why should merchants alone be blamed? Moreover, when materials are scarce and replenishment is difficult, it cannot be said that it is a legitimate way for merchants to protect themselves by purchasing as many raw materials and goods as possible. As for borrowing money to purchase goods and using goods as collateral for debts, this is a common occurrence in the business world. Various laws and regulations have never stipulated that operating funds should be limited to paid-in capital. If strict restrictions are imposed, prohibiting merchants from borrowing money to purchase goods, then what will so many commercial and financial institutions do? What kind of business will they lend to?</p>
<p>In short, restricting storage and investigating hoarding are originally intended to be justifiable. When they are implemented vigorously and thoroughly inspected, hoarded goods may be released one after another, temporarily stabilizing the market price. However, there are often both advantages and disadvantages, and the implementation technique is particularly problematic. After too much is released and the reserves are weak, or the restrictions are too strict and the inflow of goods is scarce, whether price increases can be curbed and the phenomenon of scarcity leading to higher prices can be avoided, following the example of the vegetable market, seems to always be a question. Moreover, there is still an abundance of idle capital, and the amount of money put out by national banks is not small. Aren't those who hold large amounts of legal tender able to take advantage of the slightly lower prices to buy in large quantities? Then hoarding is still hoarding. The only difference may be that the hoarders have been replaced! Moreover, when there are goods to hoard, the problem is still the level of prices. When there are no goods to hoard, the problem is beyond the level of prices. Someone said it well: High and low prices are one problem, and availability is another problem; and the latter's severity may be even greater than the former. This statement also seems to be quite worth pondering.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 9th] Vice President Li Zongren met with a UPI reporter alone on the 9th and said: All existing agreements between China and the Soviet Union, such as the 1945 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Dalian-Lushun and Changchun Railway agreements, have long been abolished due to the actions of the Soviet Union itself.</p>
<p>When asked about his opinion on Article 3 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which stipulates that if either country is attacked or invaded, the two countries have an obligation to help each other, Li said: "I even doubt whether the treaty contains this article, but even if it does, it must only refer to and be limited to certain small areas such as the Northeast and Northwest. I believe that the Soviet Union has never been willing to comply with the treaty's provisions regarding its obligations. In my opinion, the Soviet Union was the first to violate the treaty in the Northeast. This alone is enough to make China lose confidence in the Soviet Union's adherence to the treaty's military mutual assistance provisions." He further said: The Soviet Union can be considered to have violated every word and every sentence of all the provisions of all agreements. The Soviet Union has never fulfilled any of the obligations it has allowed and guaranteed to do. "Any treaty must be adhered to by both parties. If one party does not fulfill its promises, then the other party has no obligation to fulfill the treaty."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 9th] Vice President Li Zongren told foreign reporters today that the situation in North China is roughly the same as it was three months ago, neither improving nor worsening. Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in North China, has repeatedly requested the central government to allocate new weapons, and is expected to receive a large amount of supplies in the next three months.</p>

<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 9th] The provincial assembly continued its transportation interpellation this morning. Assemblymen were emotional.

Lang replied: A decision should be made after the court investigation is concluded. The grain report and interpellation in the afternoon was another high tide. Hong Houlian, representing the interests of landlords, demanded that the Grain Administration purchase surplus grain from large landowners at market prices, using the excuse that no other province in the mainland has measures to purchase surplus grain from large landowners, and criticized the Grain Administration for inaccurate surveys of production costs and unclear purposes of selling surpluses, and finally requested the formation of another grain adjustment committee. Director Li replied that, in order to stabilize grain prices and safeguard the lives of Taiwanese compatriots, purchasing at market prices is not feasible and is extremely unreasonable. Although there are no purchase regulations in the mainland, there is requisition, and landlords bear 40% of their income, while in this province it is only slightly less than 18%, which cannot be said to be unfavorable. Selling surpluses subsidizes fertilizer prices, which is still returned to the rural areas for further production. There is no need to form a grain adjustment committee.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] After the truce in Palestine expired at 7:00 AM local time on the 9th, the Jewish side announced that the Egyptian army, covered by multiple tank divisions, had launched a fierce attack in the Gaza Strip in southern Palestine, which has been met with a disastrous defeat. Jerusalem has been experiencing intense mortar fire since last night, with shells falling near Mount Zion.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 8th] Egyptian Spitfire aircraft dropped several bombs here today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Haifa, 8th] With the expiration of the truce period in Palestine imminent, the war in the southern Holy Land has broken out. According to a telegram from the Israeli Foreign Minister to the United Nations Headquarters, Egyptian armored units and infantry have attacked Israeli military positions in southern Palestine, and fierce fighting is underway. After receiving the report, the Security Council immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Palestine. According to a New York radio report, conflicts have also occurred in the Haifa and Jerusalem areas. As both Jewish and Arab sides prepare to resume hostilities, the plan for United Nations personnel to withdraw from the Holy Land has been completed. It is expected that all United Nations personnel will be evacuated from the Holy Land within two hours after the truce expires at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. Fifty members of the United Nations truce supervision secretariat and guards, as well as U.S. Army and Air Force personnel, will be concentrated in Beirut, while U.S. Navy personnel will board U.S. ships in Haifa for evacuation. The U.S. aircraft carrier "Balu" has already entered the port of Haifa today to evacuate personnel and vehicles. U.S. destroyers patrolling the coast of Palestine during the truce period will continue to remain in Haifa until the last United Nations personnel are evacuated to a safe location. Mr. Bunche, the first secretary assigned to the headquarters of UN mediator Bernadotte, will fly from Rhodes to Beirut on the 9th to supervise the evacuation. It is said that a small number of United Nations guards may remain in Jerusalem to carry out their tasks when negotiating the establishment of a demilitarized zone in Jerusalem. Bernadotte said in Haifa today that the Jewish side had also agreed to extend the truce for 30 days, but the Arab side had refused. The Jewish side had also agreed to extend the truce for three days to facilitate the evacuation of United Nations personnel, but this has also been rejected by the Arab side. Bernadotte expressed disappointment and regret over the imminent resumption of fighting in the Holy Land, but at the same time declared that although an agreement to not resume fighting between the two sides was not established, he would continue to work to achieve a truce in the Jerusalem area and the establishment of a demilitarized zone there. Bernadotte acknowledged that the Jewish side had agreed to establish a demilitarized zone in Jerusalem, but the Arab response was unclear and needed to be clarified. According to a Cairo dispatch, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, formally announced in Cairo on the night of the 8th that hostilities in Palestine would resume at dawn on the 9th (6:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time, 3:00 PM Shanghai Summer Time).</p>

<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] The Arab League has formally notified Bernadotte that they will order combat troops in Palestine to abide by the truce agreement in the Old City of Jerusalem. As long as the other side does not attack the Old City of Jerusalem, the Arab army will never use the Old City as a base for combat operations outside Jerusalem. Regarding the proposal to declare the port area and refinery area of Haifa as demilitarized zones, the Arab League does not object in principle, but insists that after becoming a demilitarized zone, strict prohibitions should be imposed on fortifications, offensives, and the import of immigrants, arms, and supplies. In order to achieve this goal, strict supervision should be implemented, allowing Arab representatives to participate in the supervision.</p>
<p>In addition, the rights of the Arab residents in the area must be guaranteed, their lives and property should be protected, and Arab refugees and workers should be allowed to freely return to their former residences in Haifa. Furthermore, the Political Committee of the Arab League held the final meeting of this session twenty-four hours before the end of the truce in the Holy Land. It is understood that the meeting discussed the issue of establishing an Arab government in the Arab-controlled areas of Palestine.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Date of Announcement for Content of Three Powers' Note to Soviet Union Not Yet Determined: Washington, London, and Paris Maintain Contact by Telephone <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Geneva, 9th, Radio: Secretary of State Marshall said today that there is no decision yet on when to announce the content of the British-American-French protest letter to the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] It is learned today that the United States, Britain, and France have differing opinions on the announcement of their note protesting the Berlin blockade to the Soviet Union and are now seeking reconciliation. According to London diplomatic officials, an agreement has been reached through transatlantic telephone consultations between the three governments, and at least until this morning, the content of the note to the Soviet Union will not be announced temporarily. The exact date of the announcement is yet to be determined, but it will likely be within the next few days.</p>
<p>Britain and France are both advocating for immediate announcement for publicity purposes to prevent the Soviet Union from preemptively publishing a reply, but the U.S. Department of State believes that the situation in Berlin is extremely serious, and the publicity issue is only secondary. Hasty announcement may prevent the Soviet Union from making a favorable reply and cause the Western countries to bear the ill repute of obstructing a solution.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] According to well-informed sources, the United States, Britain, and France have suggested to the Soviet Union to reopen all negotiations on the Berlin issue if the Soviet Union immediately lifts the blockade of Berlin. The suggestion by the United States, Britain, and France to negotiate the overall situation in Berlin is included in the notes sent separately to the Soviet Union by the three countries on the 6th. The note also reiterates the right of the Western Allies to share the occupation of Berlin. The United States, Britain, and France have decided not to be forced out of Berlin by Soviet threats, as Berlin is in fact an international zone and not part of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. Also, the suggestion for the four powers to reopen Berlin negotiations is expected to be supported by the commanders-in-chief of the four powers' occupation forces in Germany and does not require the foreign ministers of the four powers to participate.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in accordance with Article 16 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times, drafted the Implementation Key Points for Warehouse Inspection in Shanghai Municipality and submitted them to yesterday's municipal meeting for discussion. After amendments were made and passed, they will be promulgated and implemented. The key points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The inspection of warehouses (godowns) of members of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Warehouses, warehouses (godowns) attached to members of the commercial guilds of banks, trust companies, and docks, and warehouses attached to various shipping companies and railway bureaus shall be handled as follows: A. A deadline for replacing customer seals and existing warehouse receipts: (1) Warehouses (godowns) should notify each customer that warehouse receipts previously issued by the warehouses (godowns) should be replaced with new warehouse receipts by the end of July. The new warehouse receipts must state the name, quantity, name of the depositor, name of the company or business, and the company license, business registration certificate number, and address of the stored goods, and the seal must be kept. When goods are shipped, the seal must be checked in addition to returning the warehouse receipt. Furthermore, the words "allegedly" must not be used on warehouse receipts, and the goods must be specified. (2) After the above warehouse receipts are replaced, each warehouse (godown) shall stamp the returned warehouse receipts with a rubber stamp bearing the words "Replaced with new receipt, void" and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. Those who fail to replace the warehouse receipts by the deadline shall have the warehouse (godown) list the warehouse receipt number, name of the stored goods, quantity, storage date, name of the owner, address, and other information and report it through the Chamber of Commerce for Warehouses or the relevant commercial guilds of banks, trusts, and docks, which shall be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. (3) After the Social Affairs Bureau compiles the aforementioned reports, it shall immediately announce them and set a deadline for applying to replace the warehouse receipts. If the application for replacement is not made by the deadline, the Social Affairs Bureau may request the municipal government to entrust various markets to sell the stored goods and deposit the proceeds in the name of the original owner in a national bank. The owners may submit their supporting documents to the municipal government for verification at any time and have their deposits returned after verification. (4) Hereafter, anyone who opens an account with a warehouse (godown) to deposit goods shall fill out a seal card. If the account name is not a company, factory, or business number, or if there is no company license, factory registration certificate, or business registration certificate number, the warehouse (godown) shall refuse to store the goods. (5) After the promulgation of these measures, all warehouses (godowns) shall uniformly issue warehouse receipts in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Reporting Designated Goods Entering and Exiting on a Bi-Weekly Basis</p>
<p>B. Strict implementation of goods source registration and dynamic reporting: (1) The total quantity of designated goods stored in all warehouses (godowns) in the city shall first be reported by the relevant association within a deadline set by the Social Affairs Bureau. Subsequently, when goods enter the warehouse, each customer shall separately and in detail register the source of the designated goods. If the source is unknown or the registration is refused, the warehouse (godown) shall refuse to store the goods. (2) Each warehouse (godown) shall report the entry and exit of designated goods on a bi-weekly basis to the trade association, which shall forward it to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. The format of the aforementioned bi-weekly report shall be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau. (3) When the ownership of the warehouse receipt for designated goods is transferred, the old and new customers shall jointly submit a transfer application to the warehouse (godown) for filing, and the warehouse shall list the transfer in the aforementioned bi-weekly report for inspection. (4) When a customer retrieves stored designated goods, they shall submit a goods withdrawal application form, which shall state the purpose of the goods. If the goods are resold, the form shall state the buyer and their address. The form shall be submitted to the warehouse (godown) for filing, and the warehouse (godown) shall list the withdrawal in the aforementioned bi-weekly report for inspection. The aforementioned application form shall bear the seal of the seal card, otherwise the warehouse (godown) may refuse to allow the goods to be retrieved. The format of the application form shall be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau. (5) Warehouses (godowns) shall not store goods without seal cards or unregistered goods.</p>
<p>Forcing Sale of Goods Stored for More Than Three Months</p>
<p>C. Statistical spot checks and handling: (1) Based on the bi-weekly reports of each warehouse (godown), the Social Affairs Bureau shall statistically compile the total quantity of designated goods stored in the city on a bi-weekly basis and report it to the municipal government for record. Anyone who fails to file the report within the deadline shall be requested by the municipal government for sealing up and the Social Affairs Bureau will dispatch personnel with relevant authorities for inspection and handling. (2) Any goods found to have no seal card and unregistered or not registered, will be regarded as hoarding and profiteering, and the warehouse (godown) will be given the appropriate punishment. (3) If a merchant engaged in the business for sale stores designated goods for more than three months without a special reason, the Social Affairs Bureau may order them to sell on the market. If they fail to comply, the market may be entrusted to sell them off, and the proceeds will still be handed over to the owner. (4) If a non-industry person or a merchant not engaged in the industry purchases and stores designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau shall report to the municipal government for approval and entrust the market to sell them off. In addition to a fine, they shall be sent to the court for handling. (5) When industry merchants hoard a large quantity of designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau may, depending on the needs of the market, order them to sell part or all of them on the market. If they fail to comply, the Social Affairs Bureau shall request the municipal government to sell them on their behalf. The aforementioned "large quantity," in addition to kerosene, newsprint, and rough-edged paper, which are stipulated to be one-fourth of the annual sales volume, shall be handled in accordance with the Regulations for the Implementation of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times (the measures are attached separately).</p>
<p>(2) The inspection methods for the warehouses (godowns) of various import and export merchants are as follows: A. The Social Affairs Bureau shall designate the names of the goods and send a letter to the Customs, the shipping companies, and the railway and customs brokers to cooperate and notify the Social Affairs Bureau of the quantity of imports and the name of the importer on a bi-weekly basis. B. Each importer shall list the quantity of designated goods, the import date, and the location of the warehouse (godown) where they are stored on a bi-weekly basis and report it to the relevant trade association, which shall forward it to the Social Affairs Bureau for inspection. C. After receiving the aforementioned notification report, the Social Affairs Bureau shall carefully verify it against the warehouse bi-weekly report. If there are any doubts, it shall investigate them to prevent concealment. D. The format of the aforementioned report shall be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Self-Provided Warehouses and Godowns</p>
<p>May Not Store Other People's Goods</p>
<p>(3) The inspection methods for self-provided warehouses (godowns) are as follows:</p>
<p>A. The location of the self-provided warehouses (godowns) of each company, factory, and business and the quantity and purchase date of the designated goods currently stored shall be reported by the Social Affairs Bureau to the relevant trade association for record by the end of July. B. Those who fail to report by the deadline will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering if it is found that they have violated the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times and the provisions of Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures. C. The self-provided warehouses (godowns) of companies, factories, and businesses shall not store the following items, otherwise they will be deemed to be hoarding: goods of others, raw materials that are not the sales products or finished products of the company. D. If a company, factory, business, or individual has a warehouse (godown) to store goods but conceals the information, any citizen may report it. If it is found that they have violated the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times and the provisions of Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, a reward will be given in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times.</p>
<p>Strictly Shutting Down Unlicensed Warehouses</p>
<p>(4) The crackdown measures for other privately established warehouses (godowns) are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Those who operate a warehouse (godown) business but have not complied with the Shanghai Municipality's Rules for the Management of Private Warehouses and obtained a registration license will be strictly shut down. B. Those who operate a warehouse (godown) business and have obtained the aforementioned registration license but have not legally joined the Chamber of Commerce for Warehouses will be given a deadline to join the association. Those who still fail to join the association after the deadline will be given a suspension of business, and will still be ordered to join the association. If they still resist and fail to join the association, the Social Affairs Bureau may send a letter to the Public Works Bureau to revoke their above-mentioned registration license and order them to cease business. C. If a citizen reports that the designated goods stored in the above two types of warehouses (godowns) violate the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times and the provisions of Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, they will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering and a reward will be given according to the rules.</p>
<p>(Addendum):</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Regarding the case of the deposit from the public utilities in this city, the Municipal Council's fifth general meeting resolved at its eleventh session to send a letter to the Public Works Bureau to discuss and handle with the companies, and requested the Municipal Government to order the handling of the case on March 24 of this year. Now the Council has received a reply from the Municipal Government stating: It has been found that the collection of deposits from users by the water, electricity, gas, and telephone public utilities companies in this city is based on the regulations of the central competent department, calculated according to one and a half months or two months of usage fees. Previously, the prices of various public utilities would fluctuate from time to time, and the deposit would also have to be adjusted accordingly. In order to avoid excessive burden on users, the Public Works Bureau was ordered to convene representatives of various public utility companies in the city to discuss repeatedly and agree on the following three temporary measures: (1) Starting from July 36th, the increase in the deposit of each public utility shall be limited to two times a year, with a period of six months between the two times. The amount of each increase shall be based on the standard of compensating for one month's usage fee. (2) The company may collect the increase in the deposit in one or two installments at its discretion. (3) The collection of deposits from new users shall be calculated based on the unit price of the month of use and the estimated monthly usage. The above measures have been approved by the 86th Municipal Government Meeting and have been transferred to the Economic and Transport, and Interior Departments for reference.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haitain Wheel sailed directly from Keelung to Japan on the 5th of this month. As of yesterday evening, there had been no report for five days. Wireless communication was also impossible, and its whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>[Also News] The bureau's Jianghe Wheel, on the Han-Yu line, loaded passengers and cargo on the 2nd of this month from Hankou and sailed upstream. On the 5th, it passed Yichang.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Another mysterious disappearance case has recently occurred in this city, the details of which are quite tortuous and bizarre. The missing person is Liu Chuanpu, a 27-year-old native of Changle, Fujian, a graduate of National Xiamen University, and currently an engineer at the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The date of disappearance was early May. Liu left the Shanghai office dormitory of the Tang-Zhan Engineering Bureau on Gordon Road and has been missing ever since. His brother, Chuanpeng, a supervisor at the Taiwan Provincial Cooperative Business Management Committee, rushed to Shanghai after receiving the news. His younger brother, Chuanzhan, who is studying at Jinan University, has placed missing person advertisements in various newspapers and reported the case to the Jiangning Branch of the Police Bureau, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>The key to Liu Chuanpu's disappearance lies in the unfortunate breakdown of his marriage. Liu became engaged to Wu Shuhui, a graduate of the Normal College and fellow villager, in 1943, and they married in Shanghai in August 1947. After the marriage, Liu returned to Tanggu alone for work, while Wu remained in Shanghai at the home of her cousin, Wu Chuanzhi. Since then, separated by distance, their longing could not alleviate their loneliness. Wu's feelings for Liu gradually changed, eventually leading her to request a divorce. According to Liu's brother, Chuanpeng, after Liu went to work in Tang-Zhan, he repeatedly tried to bring his wife north, but Wu refused, using the instability in the north as an excuse.</p>
<p>Identity Card, Clothing, and Money: Nothing Taken at the Time of Departure</p>
<p>Liu came to Shanghai in February of this year, but Wu abruptly returned to Fuzhou to avoid him. Liu had no choice but to return north to Tanggu. In mid-April, his father-in-law, Liu Yang, celebrated a major birthday, and Liu wanted to take this opportunity to return to Fujian to offer his congratulations, but Wu strongly opposed it. Liu, because his wife made excuses that there were many troubles in the north and was unwilling to go to Tanggu, in order to seek family reunion, planned to work in Taiwan, and came to Shanghai at the end of April. Unexpectedly, Wu suddenly requested a divorce. Liu refused. On May 4, a conflict arose during an argument between the two, and Liu beat his wife, injuring her eye, and she was treated at the Sino-American Hospital. That evening, Liu still returned to the dormitory. According to the tea server, Liu left the dormitory at 8:30 the next morning and never returned. His identity card, resume, documents, clothing, money, etc., were all left in the room and he took nothing with him. However, his father-in-law received a distress telegram in Fuzhou on May 4 and came to Shanghai on the 6th. He said that on the morning of May 7, he even went to the dormitory to invite Liu to meet with him, and then Liu said he was going out to find a lawyer, and has been missing since. So, when did Liu disappear? This has become a mystery.</p>
<p>Suspected Murder</p>
<p>His brother, Chuanpeng, believes that Liu did not take any money or documents with him, so he would not have traveled far. If it was suicide, why haven't his remains been found by the police, in hotels, or in the river, nor has he left a suicide note? Therefore, he suspects it was murder, and who the murderer is, he alleges that his sister-in-law "has another love interest," and because the divorce was not granted and she was beaten, she harbored resentment and there must be someone behind the scenes plotting. He pointed out why, after Liu's disappearance, Wu did not immediately report to the police station or publish a missing person advertisement, and why she didn't send a telegram to Chuanpeng on the day of the incident, but waited until Liu's father-in-law returned to Fujian on May 15 before sending a letter inviting him to discuss the matter. Reporter yesterday interviewed Liu's wife, Wu Shuhui, at her mother's home. Wu was calm and collected. She said that the breakdown of her relationship with Liu did not begin after they separated. Initially, Wu and Liu's sister-in-law were classmates, and that's how they met. At that time, Wu was still young, and her father was very fond of Liu, so they got engaged just ten days after meeting. After the marriage, Wu felt that Liu's personality was stubborn and dictatorial, and since he had gone to the north, Wu felt that "if marriage is only for eating, then not getting married can also find something to do," so "it's better to get a divorce."</p>
<p>Questioned Twice: No Results</p>
<p>When Liu came to Shanghai in February, Wu proposed a divorce. At that time, Liu agreed and wrote a note, which included the phrases "Both parties have incompatible opinions and it is difficult to grow old together. From this day forward, the divorce is unconditional. After this, I will not interfere with any of Wu's actions." (This note is now considered one of the suspicious points by Liu's brother, because the date was not filled in at the end, the seal has an 　　mark added to it, and the name of the witness was filled in and then crossed out with ink.) The reporter asked why Liu agreed to a divorce in February, but this time when he came to Shanghai, he argued with Wu and even beat her. Wu replied that she did not know the reason. She also said that Liu never told her where his relatives and friends were, and after he disappeared, she thought he was staying at a friend's house, so she was not in a hurry to look for him. The reporter asked if she felt sad that Liu was now missing. Wu said that until his whereabouts are clear, getting emotional is superfluous. She also said that Liu may have gone to another place, and that the advertisements placed in the newspaper by his brothers contain many things that are not true about her.</p>
<p>This case is now being handled by the Jiangning Police Station, which has questioned Wu Shuhui and Xu Zhishan, the tea server at the engineering bureau's dormitory, twice, but has yielded no results. It is feared that it will be difficult to solve the case for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Public Buses Resume Service; Fired Drivers and Ticket Sellers; Xin Is Willing to Accept Severance Pay; Procedures for Receiving Payments to be Processed Today <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The strike wave caused by the leave-without-pay policy for 197 ticket sellers and drivers of the Municipal Public Transportation Company escalated to an extreme state by about 3 a.m. yesterday, before taking a sharp turn for the better. The workers accepted the advice of Director Zhao Zengjue and withdrew from the company's employee welfare association on Fair Road, details of which were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. At 6 a.m., buses on various lines successively left the factory and resumed service. Although Lines 9 and 10 were temporarily suspended at around 10 a.m., they were quickly restored after persuasion from the authorities. By the afternoon, vehicles on all lines had fully returned to normal.</p>
<p>As for the dismissed drivers and ticket sellers, the company decided on two options: (1) Those willing to accept leave without pay will be given two months' severance pay, calculated according to the June cost of living index, and the bonuses from July 1 to 7 will be paid as calculated. (2) The company has expressed its acceptance in principle of the workers' proposal that senior workers voluntarily forgo two days of wage increases each month to subsidize new workers, but all senior workers must sign a guarantee, to be completed within three days. New and old workers started signing yesterday. However, there were already more than forty people who were willing to accept leave without pay, and today they will go through the procedures for receiving payments. The signing by old workers to give up two days of wage increases is not going smoothly, and there is a lot of disagreement among the old workers. Few are willing to sign. Some of the dismissed new workers also stated that they are unwilling to have the problems of a small number of them reduce the income of all old workers. It is expected that the majority of those willing to accept severance pay will be the majority today. According to Director Zhao, if the source of gasoline is resolved in the future, and the company's plan to open two new lines, 16 and 18, is realized, then this group of drivers and ticket sellers can be recalled and continue to be given work.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Sixteen Magazines Suspend Publication for One Issue to Protest Unreasonable Increase in Airmail Rates; Decision to Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The magazine industry in this city, in order to protest the unreasonable measures taken by the post office regarding domestic newspapers in the increase of airmail postage, yesterday received reporters at the Tsinghua Alumni Association, painfully pointing out that the magazine industry is currently suffering from various difficulties and is almost on the verge of collapse. After this increase in airmail postage, the postage for newspapers is twice that of ordinary letters, that is, for every twenty centimeters, it has increased from 10,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. According to this regulation, sending one magazine by airmail would require postage of 120,000 yuan, which has actually exceeded the selling price of the magazine itself. This will undoubtedly increase a major burden on readers and will also be a major blow to the magazine industry in the future. For the sake of protest, three measures have been decided as follows: (1) Two representatives will be sent to the capital to petition the relevant authorities. (2) Forty-six magazines will jointly publish a protest declaration. (3) Sixteen weekly and semi-monthly publications have decided to suspend publication for one issue, starting today, to show their protest.</p>
<p>It is understood that the sixteen publications that will be suspended are Bank Weekly, Observation, New Road, Industry and Commerce World, Municipal Review, Textile Weekly, Times, Outlook, National Glory English, Reconstruction Review, World Knowledge, Youth Life, Economic Review, Digest, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Post Office Statement: Price Increase Entirely Passive <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Municipal Postal Administration yesterday, the increase in airmail postage was based on the adjustment of freight rates by the airline, and the post office was entirely in a passive position. Previously, the airline charged the post office the same rate for letters and printed matter. As for bulk-mailed newspapers, it was charged at 60% of the preferential rate for airmail books and small packages. This time, the airline increased prices, in addition to generally increasing freight rates by 180%, it also adjusted the base, with printed matter being double the rate of letters (the preferential method for newspapers remains the same), so the post office had no choice but to appropriately increase the airmail postage for printed matter. As for the method of charging for letters under 20 centimeters and charging for books and small packages for those over 20 centimeters, it has long been abolished and is not applicable.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Jianhua, a 25-year-old from Hangzhou, recently had a whimsical idea. He falsely created titles and used the introduction of jobs as bait to lure unemployed workers to extort activity fees. The number of victims reached more than fifty. As a result, the deception was exposed and he was arrested and sent to the police station. Li lives in a three-story attic at No. 16, Lane 827, Jiaozhou Road. Recently, out of extreme boredom, he started activities on the 8th of last month, claiming to be the "General Manager of Jianhua Coal Company," "Deputy General Manager of Lida Trading Company," and "Section Chief of the Personnel Section of Tiansheng Tobacco Company," and falsely claimed that he knew all 99 warehouses in this city and that there would be no problem introducing work. At that time, an unemployed person from northern Jiangsu named Song Yutian heard this and believed it to be true, so he contacted him. Li saw an opportunity and asked Song to find a team and enticed him to let him serve as a foreman when he worked in the future. After Song found more than 50 unemployed workers from various places, Li indicated that each person had to pay an activity fee of 6 million yuan before he could actively work. Song and others did not suspect him and immediately agreed to pay 3 million yuan first, and the other half would be paid after the job was found. Unexpectedly, after Li obtained this money, he avoided meeting them. Only then did Song and others realize that they had been deceived. According to a report, the Jiangning Road Police Station arrested Li, who confessed to defrauding money. The bureau has now transferred Li to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Guo Guixuan, a 42-year-old rice merchant from Hebei, loaded 900 bags of rice from Hankou onto the Tianyi Wheel on February 24 of this year and stored it in the Litai Warehouse. By May 7, he sold 500 bags of it to a rice store on Shunchang Road, and recently planned to load the remaining 400 bags onto a wheel to be transported to Tianjin for sale. However, the customs authorities, based on the Food Control Regulations, stipulated that if rice from other places arrives in Shanghai and has not been shipped out after more than one month, it will be regarded as hoarding, so customs clearance for export was not allowed. This matter was subsequently detected by the Economic Police, who arrested Guo and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Now that the investigation has been completed, Guo has been prosecuted on suspicion of hoarding and profiteering.</p>

The next day, Chen took the receipt to the store to pick up the goods, but found that no one had heard of it in the store, and then realized that he had been deceived, so he reported to the Laozha Police Station, accusing Ma and others of falsely establishing a cotton cloth store and issuing blank warehouse receipts.

<h3 id="e101">川康 Border Region - Suppressing the Black Yi <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ouyang Chun</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Gan Yu Gumu Gan'er (full name), who grew up in Ebian, is a Black Yi universally known in the Sichuan-Kang border region. He is strong and astute, acts cautiously, and is always accompanied by fifty to sixty armed attendants. Whenever he arrives at a location, he maintains strict vigilance and does not linger in any place for long. Commissioner Liu led troops to fight him for half a year, and to this day, not a single officer or soldier has ever caught sight of Mu Gan'er himself. This Black Yi leader, who is only twenty-four years old, already privately owned over eighty rifles, four light machine guns, and a group of over eight hundred Yi people, eight hundred rifles, and over one hundred thousand rounds of ammunition from Mu Jia Camp and Zongzi Mountain by the end of last year. In case of any emergencies, he can also mobilize over four hundred Yi people with guns from the Greater Liang Mountains for support (Note 1). The five counties of Leshan, Emei, Muchuan, Ebian, and Mabian in western Sichuan have suffered from Mu Gan'er's harassment because Mu Gan'er has been forcibly planting opium seedlings and harboring fugitives over the years, greatly impacting the security of southwestern Sichuan and the Sichuan-Kang border region. Yi people are good at climbing mountains, can fight independently, endure cold and last for a long time, do not need supplies, and are skilled at shooting. Therefore, before Commissioner Liu urgently telegraphed a report to the Headquarters, Mu Gan'er had already occupied Yaya Creek, Huaqiu Zao, Tea Garden, Dahuo Di, Laoying Yan, Zhangjia Shan, and Mu Jia Camp in Ebian, up to the edge of Tuan Yan, and also seized Shibei Gang, Jin Yan Creek, Baila Ping, and Shisun Ping. According to those who participated in the battle, all key strongholds in the Yi area are fortified with protective works that cannot be destroyed by small cannons. The troops also have organized battalions, companies, and platoons, and some even wear military uniforms.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government mobilized the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Provincial Security First Regiment, the 5th District Security Police Battalion, the Ebian County Township Police Battalion, the Leshan and Muchuan County Police Squadrons, and Abull self-reformed Yi soldiers.</p>
<p>They joined forces to suppress them and utilized the Linchangzi Reclamation Cooperative (Note 2) and the power of Zhou Ze and Yin Hongjun (Note 3) to quell the Mu Gan'er Incident. The following is an excerpt from the report of the Commander-in-Chief Liu Ren'an at the time, to glimpse the course of the battle:</p>
<p>"The headquarters was set up in Shaping, and the forces were divided into three routes. The central route was commanded by Li Long, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Provincial Security Force, with a force of about six companies. The left wing was commanded by Jin Anren, the commander of the 5th District Security Battalion, with about five companies. The right wing was led by He Zhengming, the magistrate of Ebian County, with two companies. The bandits resisted stubbornly, relying on their dangerous terrain. After fierce fighting, the Yi people were unable to withstand and retreated. The central route successively occupied Yaya Creek, Huanglian Gang, Yanwo Zi, and Mi Jia Shan. The left wing occupied Shizi Yan, Zhangjia Shan, Mu Jia Camp, Zhutou Shan, and Laoying Yan. The right wing, due to the difficult terrain, with steep cliffs, virgin forests, and temperatures below zero, and snow several feet deep, eventually occupied Xindian Zi, Heishan Gou, and Shisun Ping. However, because the Provincial Security Team delayed its attack due to resolving winter cotton clothing and transporting grain, the climate changed drastically, with ice and snow everywhere, and Mu Gan'er was able to escape (Note 4). Afterwards, over a hundred Bai Yi families sent representatives, Ma Fuhua and others, to surrender to me, voluntarily handing over rifles. The entire campaign resulted in the killing of four bandit leaders, fifty bandit followers, wounding fifty bandits, capturing one bandit leader, one hundred and thirty-one bandits, self-reforming five bandit leaders, and seven hundred bandits. We lost two officers, seventeen soldiers, wounded seven officers, forty-three soldiers, and had soldiers go missing."</p>
<p>Currently, the Yi people who surrendered in Ebian have been reorganized into security units and are automatically uprooting opium seedlings, vowing never to plant opium again. According to Sichuan Provincial Chairman Wang Lingji's report to the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters: "County Magistrate He Zhengming has gone deep into the Yi area to supervise and inspect the uprooting, and has also gathered over ten Bai Yi representatives, including Ma Fuhua, Jiaodu'er, Niu Niu'er, and Da Hanzi, to do their best to acculturate. The recovered area has been stationed with a company each of the Security Police Battalion in Changti, Yaya Creek, and Mao Ping to deter them. In addition, Huai De Township was established in the Dahuo Di Yi area, appointing Huang Yunsheng, a local gentry from Mao Ping, as the township head, building forts, organizing baojia (neighborhood watch system), increasing food production, and registering Yi guns for the aftermath. In Commissioner Liu Ren'an's special request, Director Zhu Shaoliang sent Section Chief Min Xiancun to Ebian on the 4th to investigate and handle the aftermath of the Mu Gan'er recovered area.</p>
<p>Four Notes: (1) The route from the Greater Liang Mountains to Mu Gan'er's Yi area in Ebian is via Yaozi Mountain and Dazu Ba. (2) The Linchangzi Reclamation Cooperative is a newly established cooperative organization in Ebian, fully controlling the Yi people outside of Tai Gan Jian, and leading Zhou Ze, Yin Hongjun, etc., to serve, contributing to the victory of the comprehensive suppression, and with the cooperative as the best reclamation institution in the entire area. (3) Zhou Ze and Yin Hongjun were originally Mu Gan'er's accomplices, but later participated in the suppression, making amends for their crimes. (4) Mu Gan'er escaped, Ebian County Magistrate and Right Wing Commander He Zhengming received a major demerit for poor command, and Lai Kaili, the head of the county government's radio station, was reprimanded for "slow communication and delaying operations."</p>

(4) Regularly deploy provincial security forces to patrol in suitable areas or military strongholds in the border areas as needed. (5) Develop transportation, exploit resources, build farmland water conservancy projects, and reward production technicians to work in the border areas, and examine whether there is a need to set up financial organizations and cooperative societies, which are initiated by the local officials in charge, and reported to the higher authorities for appropriate measures. (6) Carefully select border officials, improve their treatment, and increase their powers. (B) Stopgap Measures: (1) Ban all levels of Tusi from setting up various miscellaneous items, and strictly prohibit all levels of Tusi or officials from illegally apportioning and extorting, and appropriately reduce or exempt their burdens. (2) Delay or exempt the conscription of military service, settle demobilized soldiers in the countryside, and appropriately give preferential treatment to grain according to local conditions.

In case of emergencies, cooperate with each other regardless of provinces or towns. (4) The management area commission shall hold border administration meetings. Without conflicting with the principles of central and provincial laws and regulations, use administrative procedures to improve the livelihood of border residents.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] The prices of goods have been slightly stable for the past few days, and although the prices of daily necessities have increased, the momentum is still slow. However, as of yesterday, the prices of daily necessities and financial commodities have increased across the board again. National banking institutions experienced a deficit of more than one trillion yesterday, and mobile capital from all over the country continued to flock to Shanghai, causing the money supply in the market to loosen. In addition, rumors of the issuance of large banknotes spread in the market, further stimulating people's hearts. The prices of rice, grain, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, etc. increased by an average of 10% to 20%, and Huagu (Chinese stocks) also had strong buying interest, with prices rising by 10% to 20%. Given yesterday's price situation, unless the authorities can take effective measures soon, another price surge will occur.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Yesterday, the prices of goods increased across the board, and news of the imminent issuance of large banknotes spread in the market, which greatly stimulated people's hearts. The silver and money industry also believes that the market's need for cash is urgent, and the national bank's inventory is not enough to cope, so large banknotes must be issued, and the time is very near. However, according to Deputy Director Chen of the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, the Central Bank has not received an issuance order, and all rumors are completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>In addition: Yesterday, the trend of money supply in this city was loose and abundant, and the hidden interest rate in the market declined, and the price increase was quite severe. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury experienced a huge deficit in the bill exchange of the silver and money industry, totaling 1045.1 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a deficit of 97 billion, the Bank of China had a deficit of 816.6 billion, the Bank of Communications had a surplus of 83.9 billion, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 246.1 billion, the CITIC Bureau had a deficit of 40.6 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had a deficit of 48.3 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a surplus of 32.3 billion, the commercial banks and financial institutions had a large exchange surplus of 1027.6 billion, a small exchange deficit of 540 billion, and foreign banks had a total surplus of 557.5 billion. It is said that the largest deficit of the Bank of China yesterday was due to the payment of funds from outports to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Rice prices in Wuxi production areas continue to rise, creating deep panic and causing prices to rise further. However, price limits remain the same, so transactions within the market are even scarcer. Only inferior indica rice is still being traded within the price limits. Off-site, both white rice and thin rice are being traded for 23.5 million, medium-grade rice is being traded for 23 million, and early rice is also reaching 22 million. The supply of high-quality rice is very small, and the price also reaches 23.5 million, an increase of 1.5 million compared to the previous day. The total amount of grain arriving at the two markets was 5,541 shi.</p>
<p>Due to high prices in the interior and rising raw material costs, flour factories have also raised their supply prices to 7.47 million yuan (including military donation). The allocated quantity is still 7,540 bags. Off-site prices were affected by the factory price and the upward trend was even more intense. The price of Laoche and Bingshun once reached 8 million, but later fell slightly. Laoche and Bingshun each closed at 7.75 million, and miscellaneous flour was also traded off-site. Wheat bran was quoted at 5 million, and wheat broke the 10 million mark, trading at 10.5 million.</p>
<p>The prices of miscellaneous grains rose, but fearing the intervention of the authorities, the cargo owners watched and dared not quote a price, so transactions were scarce. The industry once proposed to set the price of Zhadou at 11.5 million and Chedou at 12.5 million, but before it was approved, it could not be traded rashly, so it was not quoted. Only small amounts of Zhuan Dou, Broad Beans, and a few Du Dou and Green Beans were quoted. The price of Green Beans rose by 1 million, and the price of Broad Beans rose by 500,000. There were no transactions in Sesame and Raw Peanuts.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices cannot rise due to price limits, but the market situation is extremely tight, and no one is willing to sell at the price limits, resulting in unresolved transactions. Later, the industry drafted the lowest cost, with raw peanut oil at 67 million and bean oil at 49 million, but it must be submitted to the mayor for approval, so the price was not quoted yesterday and the market remained halted. Only small-sized Giktong sesame oil was traded at 65 million, an increase of 4.5 million. Secondary-sale barrel of cooked vegetable oil was traded at 45 million, net cooked vegetable oil at 43 million. At the early market for bean cake, 500 pieces of May cake were quoted at 4.8 million, and no further quotes were made in the afternoon market.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Following the authorities' intensified measures to stabilize prices, the situation in the fabric market has indeed improved. Market brokers are cooperating earnestly, adhering to the three directives from the Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>The inspectors stationed at the Yarn Control Committee and relevant personnel from the Garrison Headquarters recently invited Chairman Chen of the Cotton Fabric Guild Brokers Association to discuss six supplementary measures to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The content includes: (1) The transaction books of each broker will be replaced with new books issued by the Association (each book starting from number one). (2) Before leaving the market each day after closing, each broker must submit their transaction book to the Association for verification, regardless of whether there were any transactions. They can then collect it for use the following morning. (3) Each broker must prepare a small notepad to record daily transactions for calculating commissions. After use, the original notepad should be submitted to the Association for inspection by the relevant authorities at any time. (4) Brokers are not allowed to carry any blank slips of paper to prevent the recording of illegal transactions. (5) The names of both buyers and sellers written on the transaction slip must match those recorded in the membership directory. (6) The "Remarks" column of the transaction slip should be specifically filled with the buyer's address. The seller's address may only be noted on the back of the buyer's copy. These supplementary measures are being implemented gradually, and it is hoped that illegal transactions can be eliminated.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market initially delayed opening due to uncertain sentiment. However, after 11:00 AM, after the release of those arrested on bail, trading activity resumed. Local processing factories actively replenished their inventories, and outside buyers were also aggressively purchasing, leading to a firm market. Later, news of a soaring stock market and easing credit conditions caused widespread price increases. Both local and outside buyers became even more eager to purchase, and buying sentiment strengthened, causing the market to rise steadily. Under the close supervision of the authorities, there was no speculative atmosphere. However, the market still felt sluggish.</p>
<p>Very little trading occurred in 42s and 40s fine yarns. It was reported that 42s "Blue Phoenix" yarn broke the 1 billion yuan mark, rising straight to a peak of 1.3 billion yuan, a sharp increase of 320 million yuan compared to the previous day.

There was a larger amount of trading in 20s "Tiannu" yarn, initially quoted at 800 million yuan, but all buyers competed to purchase, causing the market to rise again. However, users were constrained by credit conditions, and most transactions were for next-day delivery, with the highest price reaching 900 million yuan.</p>
<p>The prices of coarser yarns such as 16s and 10s initially remained flat before rising, with overall gains ranging from 50 to 100 million yuan. A total of 52 transaction slips were recorded for the day, totaling 222 bales of fine yarn.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market saw the influx of speculative funds and a sudden easing of credit conditions. New buyers were actively purchasing, and remittances from North China arrived. The Tianjin buyers were eager to purchase, and Sichuan buyers were also busy absorbing at lower prices, using funds remitted from previous sales. Traders within the industry were also actively purchasing, leading to a bullish market.</p>
<p>Off-exchange, the asking price for "Dragon Head" fine cloth reached 30 million yuan, but transactions were eventually made at 29.5 million yuan, a rise of approximately 20%. Mid-range "Laba" and "Tongwufu" as well as "Dragon Head B" fine cloth also soared by 10 to 15% due to active buying. Other fabrics such as "Four Gentlemen," "Jinlian Miaowu" drill, fine twill, coarse cloth, colored cloth, shirting, and other materials also saw general increases of over 1 to 2 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market saw sellers eager to unload their inventory in the morning, leading to successive declines. However, due to acceptable domestic sales of Qimen Chen Hua Xiang and broken red tea, prices eventually rose again. As for green tea, which is mainly exported, the trend weakened instead of rising. It was rumored among industry insiders that a certain location in North Africa had a large inventory of tea. Although there are plans to purchase, they are attempting to suppress prices. Consequently, owners who had been profiting became uneasy and frequently sold off their inventory, causing prices to decline. However, according to general opinion, with the need to process and refine the tea for consumption, it is predicted that the future will be stable.</p>

Yang Renfu lectured on "Scientific Spirit and Democracy" on the 9th. At the end of his lecture, he said: I was almost condemned by false rumors. The impression I got after arriving in Shenyang was exactly the opposite of dangerous prejudice; the local government and the public are writing history, not drawing conclusions. Professor Wang Tieya said in his lecture on "American Foreign Policy" yesterday: The United States lacks understanding of the Northeast, and the safety of the Northeast determines the overall situation in China.</p>

<h3 id="e142">National Tennis Committee Established, First Batch of Nineteen Members Appointed by the Sports Association <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, Secretary-General of the National Sports Association, and Zhao Minheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Sports and Youth Association Tennis Committee, jointly invited tennis enthusiasts in this city to a meeting at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 7:00 PM on the day before yesterday (8th). Huang Shaohong, Xu Chongzhi, Li Shuming, Xu Zhendong, Xu Guogang, Shi Yonggeng, Liu Nianyi, Li Leishi, Wu Bangwei, Yu Zhizhong, Lu Chunbo, and others attended the meeting. Hao Gengsheng served as chairman, and Jiang Huaiqing served as the recorder. This meeting formally established the National Tennis Committee and approved the candidates for the first batch of members, who will be appointed by the National Sports Association. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Secretary-General Hao Reports on the Process</p>
<p>(A) Report Matters: First, Chairman Hao Gengsheng reported on the significance of organizing the National Tennis Committee, stating: Based on the resolution of the Board of Directors, I have contacted President Wang Zhengting of the National Sports Association several times, and we believe that to revive sports in China and improve the technical level of various sports, there must be a national independent organization for each sport, under the jurisdiction of the National Sports Association, specifically responsible for promoting and advancing the work in each department. Currently, the plan is to first organize the national organizations for tennis, soccer, and basketball. Especially in the area of tennis, thanks to Mr. Zhao Minheng's efforts in planning and the enthusiastic support of everyone present, it will be the first to be established. I recently went to various parts of Southeast Asia for inspections, and the overseas Chinese are also very supportive. Today's meeting is the first preparatory meeting, also the establishment meeting, of the National Tennis Committee. This is a major event in the Chinese sports world. The soccer and basketball organizations will be organized after I return from attending the World Games. As for the selection of members, after obtaining the consent of everyone, the National Sports Association will send appointment letters. The selection of members from other units will be added later. It is hoped that after the establishment of the Committee, it will focus on international tennis competitions and communication, as well as national tennis competitions and promotion matters, especially emphasizing the training of young people. It is hoped that in ten years, Chinese players will be able to reach the finals in the Davis Cup. Thank you for your presence and help.</p>
<p>Zhao Minheng then reported: Mr. Hao Gengsheng contacted me after the National Games to discuss the issue of organizing a national tennis organization. I immediately contacted tennis enthusiasts in this city informally, and they were all optimistic and supportive. It is believed that China lacks tennis talent, and in order to popularize and develop the sport and cultivate outstanding talent, there must be an independent organization to promote it in a planned manner. In the past, the Shanghai tennis community lacked organization and even more so lacked complete venue facilities, making promotion work very difficult. Therefore, this year we are determined to build a relatively complete tennis club, which is currently under construction and will be completed and opened by the end of this month. It is hoped that the National Tennis Committee will be affiliated with this newly built club. It is hoped that this new club will not only be the general headquarters of the Shanghai tennis community, but also become the general headquarters of the national tennis community. With the combination of human and geographical advantages, I believe that China's tennis future is not without hope.</p>
<p>Passage of First Batch of Member List</p>
<p>(B) Discussion Matters: The discussion and exchange of opinions then began, resolving: (1) The list of candidates for the National Tennis Committee members was approved. The first batch consists of 19 people, who will be appointed by the National Sports Association. Members from overseas Chinese regions such as the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as other important provinces and cities, will be appointed after the candidates from each unit are determined. The list of the first batch of members is as follows: Huang Shaohong, Xu Chongzhi, Ma Yuehan, Hao Gengsheng, Diao Zuqian, Cai Huihong, Qiu Zuorong, Hang Chen Yuemei, Li Shuming, Xu Guogang, Xu Bandong, Shi Yonggeng, Guan Shengfu, Li Leishi, Liu Nianyi, Chen Chunbo, Yu Zhizhong, Wu Bangwei, Zhao Minheng. (2) Committee Member Zhao Minheng was appointed as Honorary Secretary-General. (3) The headquarters will be located in Shanghai. (4) The first plenary meeting of the National Tennis Committee will be held at the next National Games. (5) Secretary-General Zhao was requested to draft the constitution of the National Tennis Committee.</p>

<p>Basketball Team Defeats Perak United Team</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 8th] Our World Games basketball team, in a dull and uninteresting match, easily defeated the Perak United Team tonight by a score of 56 to 20.

<p>[Our Report] The Philippine Red Socks baseball team, which has swept the baseball scene in Shanghai, will meet with local baseball fans again tomorrow with a brand-new look. Since arriving in Shanghai last week, the Red Socks team has shown their might, defeating the Chinese team 5-0, and then crushing the Chinese All-Star team 7-1. The third and fourth games were both held on the 5th.

The team was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai by plane on the 7th, but due to the devastating typhoon, they were unable to depart. They have rescheduled their departure for next Wednesday and, during their stay in Shanghai, they do not want to keep their uniforms packed away for too long, and have decided to play some more games with strong teams in Shanghai. In addition to making up the baseball exhibition game with the Air Force that was canceled on Tuesday due to rain, they will also play a softball friendship game with the local softball champion Panda team at the Racecourse at 10:00 AM, and a softball friendly game with the Filipino community at 6:00 PM, to thank all sectors in Shanghai for their hospitality.

<h3 id="e149">School Introduction: Overview of National Fudan University <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>1. History</p>
<p>[Our Special Visit] The predecessor of Fudan University was the Aurora College, founded by Mr. Ma Xiangbo in the spring of the ninth year before the Republic of China. At that time, the remaining rooms of the Xujiahui Observatory were used as college buildings, and foreign missionaries were hired as volunteer professors. Mr. Ma served as the supervisor. All affairs within the college were managed by the students, fostering a spirit of autonomy. The subjects offered were four types: linguistics, mathematics, physics, and epistemology. The teaching method aimed to stimulate students' free research. Two years later, when the spring semester began, there was a conflict of authority between foreign professors and the college due to the student payment issue, resulting in the dispersal of students. Therefore, they abandoned the old and sought the new. Soon, they heard from Governor Zhou Fu of Jiangsu, who telegraphed the Shanghai Daotai to allocate a loan and land to transfer and build temporary school buildings in Wusong. The school name was changed to Fudan, meaning "restoring Aurora." In August of that year, it was formally established, with Mr. Ma serving as the president and Dr. Li Denghui as the provost. Thus, Aurora College transformed into Fudan Public School, which is the predecessor of the current Fudan University.</p>
<p>Two years later, Mr. Ma was ordered to go to Japan, and Yan Fu succeeded him as the president. By the time of the Xinhai Revolution, the Wusong school buildings were occupied by the Song Army, and the public school was interrupted. At the beginning of the Republic of China, Mr. Ma and the alumni association conspired to restore the school with the help of Chen Ying Shidu, and the Li Gong Temple in Xujiahui was designated as the school building, and classes were resumed. In the second year of the Republic of China, Dr. Li Denghui succeeded him as the president and was determined to reform. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into a university, and the scale was expanded. Mr. Li personally went to various parts of Nanyang to raise huge sums of money and purchased land in Jiangwan successively. By the winter of the ninth year of the Republic of China, construction was started, and the university department was moved in from Xujiahui in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. The original site of the Li Gong Temple was used as the school building for the middle school department. In the thirteenth year, Guo Renyuan acted as the president. During the ten years that followed, the school building project was expanded, and it was successively approved by the former Ministry of Education in Beijing and the former University Council of the National Government. In the eighteenth year, in accordance with the university regulations promulgated by the Ministry, the four colleges of literature, science, law, and commerce were established. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, President Li was granted a leave of absence by the Board of Trustees due to old age and frailty. Tian Qianzhi and Wu Nanxuan served as president and vice-president, respectively. In the twenty-sixth year, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out. The Tan School and the Daxia Fire School jointly moved inland to start classes, with the first department in Lushan and the second department in Guiyang. The former was mainly based on the school, and the latter was mainly based on the Daxia. Unexpectedly, the war situation suddenly changed before the Lushan school had started for a month, and the disaster of the Kou became more and more serious. Therefore, they moved to Chongqing and temporarily borrowed classes from the Fudan Middle School in Caiyuanba. In March of the following year, the school and Daxia separated and rented Huangjue Town in Beibei, Chongqing, to start classes. Therefore, the equipment was simple, and the teachers were lacking. However, the emotions of the teachers and students became more and more resilient. In the same year, more than 400 mu of land in Xiaba, Beitiao, was purchased, and major construction was carried out year by year, and a farm was opened. The original barren land was transformed into a magnificent institution of higher learning in no time. Teachers and students studied there, and the people of the accompanying capital envied and admired each other. In the spring of the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, the Ministry ordered the school to be changed to a national institution. The following year, the Ministry sent Zhang Yi to succeed him as the president, striving to improve the teaching and research equipment and actively expand the construction, which increased day by day. During this period, the journalism students and teachers cooperated to build the Journalism Museum, which was completed in the spring of the thirty-fourth year, and was especially noticed by people in the journalism industry. Therefore, the equipment was gradually complete. Looking across the river, the magnificent school buildings were row upon row, the water flowed gurgling, the strings and songs filled the ears, and the prosperity of humanities was unprecedented.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, the school returned to the east and moved back to the original site in Jiangwan. In the spring of the thirty-fifth year, the authorities allocated many buildings of enemy property to the south of the school to make up for the shortage, but it was still far from enough. Prior to that, the school had set up a cram school in Shanghai when it moved inland. At this point, the students and staff in Shanghai and Chongqing gathered together, and the expansion of its scale and size far surpassed that of the past.</p>
<p>2. Current Situation</p>
<p>The school currently has more than 2,800 faculty and students, divided into five colleges of literature, science, law, commerce, and agriculture, with a total of 23 departments and sections. The details are as follows: (1) College of Literature: Department of Chinese, Department of Foreign Languages, Department of History and Geography, Department of Journalism, Department of Education. (2) College of Science: Department of Mathematics and Physics, Department of Chemistry, Department of Biology (with marine group), Department of Civil Engineering. (3) College of Law: Department of Law (with judicial group), Department of Political Science, Department of Economics (with Institute of Economics), Department of Sociology. (4) College of Commerce: Department of Banking, Department of Accounting, Department of Statistics, Department of Cooperation, Department of Statistics. (5) College of Agriculture: Department of Agronomy, Department of Horticulture, Tea Specialization. Last year, entrusted by the Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the school jointly ran a training class for senior fisheries technicians and opened two cram school classes (equivalent to the previous pre-university classes) to accommodate students who applied to the school but were not admitted and passed the screening test. After one year of study, if they want to enter the school, they still have to participate in the freshman examination. In addition, in order to train prison management talents, the Ministry of Education will add a specialization in court prison officials in the school next semester, with a two-year graduation.</p>
<p>The school is now一心一意, trying to improve the level of students and enhance the academic level. Last year, more than 12,000 people applied, ranking first in the national non-regional enrollment. In the future, the school has decided to focus on quality rather than quantity, and the admission standards for freshmen will also be increased as much as possible.</p>
<p>This summer, all colleges and departments are recruiting male and female freshmen in the first grade. Among them, except for the entire Department of Education, which is treated as normal students, the Chinese, Foreign Languages, History and Geography Departments of the College of Literature, and the Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Departments of the College of Science also recruit one-tenth of normal students. Registration dates are from August 1st to 4th, and the examination dates are from August 10th to 12th. See July 5th issue of this newspaper for details.</p>
<p>3. Equipment</p>
<p>The school's equipment was already of a certain scale before the war. The losses during the westward migration and the occupation by the enemy puppets were quite heavy, and it has not yet recovered its old appearance. Among them, the loss of books is the most serious. Fortunately, some were purchased in the rear, and they are now being merged and cataloged, which can barely be used, but it is still far from ideal. In terms of equipment, the experimental equipment and laboratories necessary for the two colleges of agriculture and engineering are generally sufficient. Among them, the metal and woodworking factory and the agricultural product processing factory have been newly built. In addition, there are the Institute of Economics and the Journalism Research Office, which have collected a wealth of relevant materials, which is especially commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e150">About Stalin <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>[Editor's Note: All those who care about the facts of World War II must know Major General Ellis M. Zacharias. Mr. Chai was the Deputy Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Navy during the war and made great contributions. This article is the information he provided to President Truman, published in the June issue of "United Nations World" magazine this year. Studying the main purpose of the original text, it seems to be an analysis of the Soviet situation after the Soviet side announced the exchange of documents between U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding direct U.S.-Soviet negotiations in May. Mr. Chai once strongly stated that his information source was absolutely reliable, and suggested that Du Shi directly discuss with the ultimate goal of signing a U.S.-Soviet non-aggression treaty, and advocated that the treaty should include the division of spheres of influence between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. However, due to space constraints, some parts had to be deleted.]</p>
<p>In 1941, President Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins saw Stalin and reported to the President: "Stalin is the Soviet Union. If we want to know what the Soviet Union will do, how it will act, how it will do it... we must see Stalin himself."</p>
<p>Hopkins' words are still equally accurate today. Stalin is the Soviet Union. He has no staff, and no think tank. Although there are many people around him, no one can influence Stalin's will, not even Molotov.</p>
<p>But Stalin himself does not want outsiders to know that everything is decided by him alone. When the current British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, talked to him about the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Stalin pointed to Molotov, who was sitting next to him, and said, "Don't blame me. This is Molotov's idea!"</p>
<p>In fact, when Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill held various meetings, Luo and Qiu brought many political and military advisors, but Stalin brought very few attendants. At the Yalta Conference, he had more attendants, but he almost never asked them for their opinions. Only once, he turned to a Red Army general and said a few words, which surprised everyone—but, in fact, Stalin just asked the general to get him a cup of tea.</p>
<p>But the Soviet Communist Party Politburo has a great influence on Stalin. According to Bayanov, a former secretary hired by Stalin, "Stalin never expresses his opinion at meetings, but listens attentively. After everyone has finished speaking, he stands up and says a few words, and his opinion is often adopted."</p>
<p>Stalin is sixty-eight years old this year. He is an extremely energetic person, but it is not easy to see on the surface. Although he worked extremely hard during the war, he is still in very good spirits. He has heart disease, and according to doctors, the disease is quite serious, but not necessarily fatal. Stalin strictly follows the doctor's instructions, just as he expects all communists to absolutely obey the party's decisions. Stalin is determined to live.</p>
<p>Stalin is determined to leave behind a strong and unified Soviet Union. Therefore, to avoid possible chaos, he is writing a book? In this book, he will list in detail his opinions on party, government, and diplomatic affairs for his future successors to refer to.</p>
<p>Stalin's current most concern is the security of this Soviet territory between Berlin and Vladivostok. As early as the Yalta Conference in 1945, he was constantly mentioning the post-war border issue. He said at the time:</p>
<p>If a country wants to go to war with another country, then it must first find a border, and strive to cross this border to reach the country it is preparing to attack. In fact, the aggressor often finds such a border—many countries often willingly "lend" it such a border.</p>
<p>The implementation of [the Truman Doctrine] made him feel that his political philosophy had been proven. But he also admitted that his own "Stalinism" had already preceded Truman. The so-called "Stalinism" is to expand the Soviet border westward to central Germany, and eastward to the Kuril Islands and North Korea north of the 38th parallel. Until the end of 1947, Stalin still believed that the fear of the revival of Germany in various countries could promote a kind of unity. But in the past six months, he discovered his mistake. What the countries fear is not Germany, but the Soviet Union itself.</p>
<p>Stalin is currently quite wary of the United States, because he suspects that the United States has aggressive intentions. But he firmly believes that the governments of Britain and the United States are definitely not willing to have another war now. He believes that there are three kinds of people in the United States who are eager to create another world war. These three kinds of people are: (1) Economic leaders, that is, what he calls "capitalists," who only seek to expand the market and do not hesitate to take any means; (2) Soldiers: Stalin believes that soldiers are not particularly fond of fighting, but are willing to create a tense situation in order to use large amounts of funds; (3) Some frustrated politicians, who want to find an opportunity to come to power in another war.</p>
<p>What is Stalin's own attitude towards war? According to the most reliable information, Stalin's meaning can be explained in the following two points: (1) He knows very well that the Soviet system cannot withstand the test of a new war (Stalin said to Harriman), so he himself has never directly taken aggressive actions; (2) However, if he is attacked, he is determined to mobilize all manpower and material resources, ruthlessly forcing the whole country to participate in the war, and never surrender. He once said: "Even if we have exhausted everything by that time: no people, no weapons, no ammunition—our women must also pick up boiling water and splash it on the invaders!"</p>
<h3 id="e151">Hurricane <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>The Nanyue Zhi states that hurricanes are common in Xi'an, and a hurricane is a wind from all directions. They usually occur in May and June, and chickens and dogs do not crow before they arrive. The Lingbiao Lu says that in summer and autumn there is a halo like a rainbow, which is called the mother of the hurricane, and there must be a hurricane. Coastal areas in Fujian and Guangdong often have hurricanes in summer and autumn, which are large whirlwinds. Each occurrence lasts for an indefinite period, and it must be a wind from all directions. If the west wind has not arrived, even if the momentum is slightly reduced, it is known that it is not over yet. After a hurricane, it must be followed by heavy rain, and only then will the state of alert be lifted. As for seeing a halo and knowing that there will be wind, it is not only the Lingbiao that knows this. In Guangzhou, people call a hurricane "hitting the wind," or "hitting the wind hurricane." The pronunciation of the word hurricane in the spoken language is slightly wrong, but it is not a different word. The English word "Typhoon," according to the Oxford Dictionary, means hurricane, and is explained as "a violent storm on the seas of China," derived from the Chinese word "大風" (dà fēng, great wind). English already has words such as "狂風" (violent wind) and "旋風" (whirlwind), so it must have taken the Chinese pronunciation to create this word, which is in line with the meaning of "naming according to the owner." More than ten years ago, I first saw the word "颱" (tái, typhoon) in a newspaper. I am ashamed of my lack of learning and still do not know where this word comes from. If it is said to be related to Taiwan, the scientific community may not say so. Is it specially made in imitation of English? If so, then it is very strange.</p>
<h3 id="e152">A Trip to Jade Emperor Mountain <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren</p>
<p>When I was at Miaozhi Temple in Qixia Ridge, I opened the window every day and saw a lush and beautiful scene in the southeast, which is Jade Emperor Mountain, also known as Yu Huang Mountain. The peaks are high and towering, and there are often clouds and mist surrounding them, but it is not included in the Ten Scenes of West Lake or the Eight Scenes of Qiantang. My friend, the lay Buddhist Mujushi, often said that the Taoist Li Zidong in the Jade Emperor Palace on the top of the mountain is very capable, and all the Taoist temples in West Lake are under the jurisdiction of the Jade Emperor Palace. The Jin Gu Cave and Ge Xian Nunnery nearby are all managed by people sent from the Jade Emperor Palace. Taoist Li is also a remarkable person.</p>
<p>I have wanted to visit Jade Emperor Mountain for a long time. One day, I went down the mountain from Ziyun Cave, entered Su Causeway to the south, passed Liu Bridge, and walked about five li. I sat for a while in the Buhua and Ban Shan Pavilions on the causeway. At the end of the causeway, I walked east and arrived at Jingci Temple, where a team was stationed, so I did not enter. Further on, there is a large stone bridge. After crossing the bridge and turning left, I got a large road with neat stone slabs. I invited the road to go towards the mountain in front of me. Both sides are mountains, gradually surrounding me, and Jade Emperor Mountain is in sight. There is a pavilion halfway, called Wangxian. Resting and continuing, I soon arrived at the entrance of the Jade Emperor Mountain Avenue, and there was another pavilion at the entrance. The stone steps were neat, and the trees on both sides were lush, so there was no suffering from the sun, and there was another pavilion, called Ciyun Cave Heaven, opposite Ciyun Cave. Turning upwards, there was a stele beside the road, inscribed with Qianyun Cave. I did not enter either of these two caves. Going up again, I was already high, peeking at the Qiantang River, the sails were distinct, and the train moving on the opposite bank was also wriggling in sight. Near the top, I saw a wooden sign indicating that Zilai Cave was accessible from here, so I first visited Zilai Cave. The cave is divided into three sections, as wide and high as a huge mansion. The first section has a tea seat, where you can sit and drink tea. Entering the second section, I went down the steps, and it was vast and empty. Entering the third section, I went down the steps again, and it was also vast and empty. People say that this is artificially opened up, large but useless, and it is very good as a bomb shelter. However, artificial construction is also very difficult. After the third section, it was dark and without light. Using a cane to explore, there were no steps, so I returned in vain. A new square was built next to the cave, with high buildings, bright windows and clean tables, spotless, which can be called a good place to escape the summer heat, but there is no lofty hermit living in it, only a photography shop in it.</p>
<p>Zilai Cave, originally named Feilong Cave, is deep and unpredictable, and it is said to be connected to the mountains in She County, Anhui, but there is no evidence. After Taoist Li Zidong opened it up, he renamed it Zilai Cave, because his name is Zidong, taking the meaning of purple energy coming from the east. The name is a bit mundane. Exiting the cave and going up again, there is a very wide pavilion, called Qixing Pavilion. Behind the pavilion are seven-star jars, which are cast in iron, as tall as a person, and surrounded by writings. The jars all contain water. There were originally seven jars, but now only five remain. Going up again from Qixing Pavilion, I had reached the top of the mountain, and the bamboo forest was dense along the way. Entering the Jade Emperor Palace, the main hall is not magnificent, but the back room is quite exquisite. Its height is about 200 meters above sea level, not as high as the north and south peaks, but its steepness exceeds them. The trees on the avenue up the mountain are especially lush, and they are the best in the area.</p>
<p>I did not want to go down the mountain the way I came, so I went down from the west. Passing a pavilion called Linhai, the west road is far less neat than the east road, and there are no trees along the road. The further I went down, the more desolate it became. I saw Hupao Temple in the distance, but I did not go there because I did not have time. After reaching the plain, I took the car road to Su Causeway and went north to return home.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Lu Xun's Book Buying <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Xin</p>
<p>The previous article discussed "Lu Xun's Book Collection" and recorded the process of his selling "A Complete Collection of Leisurely Talks." This article will briefly describe Lu Xun's involvement in the book market, focusing on his "book buying."</p>
<p>According to records, Lu Xun mostly purchased Japanese books at Uchiyama Bookstore. When he needed Western masterpieces, he would also ask the store to order them on his behalf. This was because Lu Xun had a close friendship with the bookstore owner and often visited the store for conversations. As for thread-bound books, he would ask his younger brother, Mr. Qiaofeng, to purchase those published by the Commercial Press on his behalf. For old block-printed books, he would go to the book market in the central district. Sometimes, he would hire a motorcycle to transport them back, which can be found in his "Diary." Among the bookstores he frequented, the China Bookstore on Xizang Road was the most visited (although it is now closed). People in the store can still vividly recount stories of his book purchases. It is said that Lu Xun paid great attention to the binding of books, always choosing those in perfect condition. He was generous with book prices and did not ask for discounts. He was also very familiar with the editions and origins of each book. This stemmed from Lu Xun's profound and solid knowledge of traditional Chinese learning, so he was very particular about versions. "Random Talks After Illness" records that in order to obtain the "newly engraved edition of the Jia Ye Tang of the Liu family in Wuxing" of the Qing Dynasty banned book "The Unofficial History of Anlong," he did not hesitate to travel repeatedly and endured the arrogance of the seller, but still did not succeed. In the end, he "asked a friend to buy it after many twists and turns," which made him realize the difficulty of obtaining books, "It seems that you have to be familiar or go to a familiar bookstore to buy it."</p>
<p>However, there were also times when he unintentionally purchased banned books. For example, the "Xiao Xue Da Quan Case" of Yin Jiaquan in the 46th year of Qianlong, which was also one of the literary inquisitions in the early Qing Dynasty. The book "Xiao Xue Da Quan," which served as the catalyst for this case, was unintentionally bought by Lu Xun while "strolling around the Fourth Road area before the Dragon Boat Festival. (referring to banned books - new note) It is called "Xiao Xue Da Quan," a total of five volumes, priced at seven corners. Seeing this title, not many people would welcome it, however, it is a banned book of the Qing Dynasty." The ease of this purchase was far different from the aforementioned purchase of "The Unofficial History of Anlong."</p>
<h3 id="e155">Savings <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>Speaking of currency issues, no one can maintain a state of calm. But the human heart is so contradictory, the more worthless paper money becomes, the more urgent the desire to preserve its value. At present, although the word "savings" has long been abandoned, another form of disguised savings, such as purchasing and storing easily sellable daily necessities, still exists. Indeed, sometimes the dividing line between "hoarding" and "saving goods" is difficult to define. If "saving goods" is used as a means of coping with unexpected expenses or temporary emergencies, then perhaps the component of forgiveness is greater than the component of condemnation.</p>
<p>In times of severe price fluctuations, whoever holds paper money in their hands feels uneasy all day long. I think this is not their true intention, but rather forced by the environment. I remember that two weeks ago, my friend A received an income of 11 million yuan and asked B to find a way to buy him some "anything." B suggested that the purchased items should be (1) easy to sell, (2) cheap and in large quantities, and (3) have a lower multiple of price increase. After B's consideration, he decided to buy toilet paper for A. A few days later, A went to see B again, but B, because the price of toilet paper had risen, instead bought 2,200 pairs of "charcoal bases" at S, which were only worth a few cents each before the war. Afterwards, what made A feel somewhat gratified and made those with meager incomes feel regret was that the current 11 million yuan could not even buy the same quantity of "charcoal bases."</p>
<p>From a more technical standpoint, this phenomenon of "saving goods" is naturally also a manifestation of a morbid state. Everyone flocks to goods, exceeding the normal supply and demand relationship, and the supply of goods will become more depleted, becoming more expensive the more they are bought, which is tantamount to "digging one's own grave." A more reasonable approach would be for the authorities to find ways to encourage various users to purchase various production tools, such as giving discounts or installment payments. As the saying goes, "A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well." Now, allowing many of the general public with limited resources or slight savings to have sharp "tools" will increase production efficiency. In this way, individual income will have another outlet, which will also be of some help in alleviating the shortage of goods?</p>

<p>"Collected Drafts from West Slope," written by Song 　, the Jiangsu Governor in the early Qing Dynasty, discusses the bestowal of food during Emperor Kangxi's southern tour, saying: Song Luo is an old minister, different from the Fujian Governor, and should be granted living sheep, pickled chicken, deer tail, deer tongue, venison, dried sturgeon, dried wild chicken, etc., according to the example of generals and governors. Another imperial decree said: I have a daily tofu, which is different from ordinary ones. Because the governor is an elderly person, the imperial kitchen eunuch can be instructed to teach the governor's cook, for the benefit of the second half of his life. Thus, the value of tofu surpassed even meat and delicacies. One wonders how good and how to make Emperor Kangxi's tofu. Liang Weiju also recorded that when he 　taught at Nanpu Academy, there was a teacher named Liu Yin 　, a professor, whose tofu-making skills were not only used in Pucheng, but also unmatched by those who discussed cooking elsewhere. This means that even "tofu-eating officials" have the most exquisite tofu. Liang also said: When he was an official in Shandong, he had a public banquet with the education commissioner, the financial commissioner, and the transport commissioner on Daming Lake. The Magistrate of Licheng County, Hou 　ying, prepared the food. After eating halfway through, each person was presented with a small dish, with five or six locusts in each dish. Eating them was extremely enjoyable, and everyone was stunned and could not discern what they were. Hou said that this was tofu. The people suspected that he had a secret recipe. The above are all mysterious stories about tofu, quite like the so-called "turning the rotten into the magical." In fact, the various ways of making tofu available in the market are already very good, and red sauce tofu and white fermented tofu each have their own ingenuity, enough to satisfy the appetite. Because tofu is inherently a good thing, but because it is produced in large quantities, it is regarded as ordinary. Once it is processed and finely made, it will naturally become a delicacy, without the need for too much mystery. However, with the recent soaring prices, red sauce tofu costs 20,000 per piece, and white tofu costs twice as much. Even the tofu sold in the vegetable market that has not been cooked is costly to buy and make, which is not the humble appearance of the past.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Lines from Deep in the Clouds <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Wu</p>
<p>I asked my brother Huang Pingxun for a poem and wrote 112 characters on a fan as a substitute for a letter, knowing that Pingxun had ink to create.</p>
<p>To be a dragon or to be a snake, look at success or failure. Killing chickens and being a dog gives birth to a hundred monsters. Huang Sheng is not 　satisfactory and returns. Spinning my yarns deep in the clouds, with few words. Ten years have passed without seeing each other, we should have a poem together. A 　coolness seeks to paint. An old friend treats me well and　the current trend. Knowing that I cherish what I have and will not sell it. Morning after morning, I grind ink with little dew. Night after night, I complete poems and break the wine abstinence. I only pity that the short-lived Pine Mushroom Marquis is exhausted, and countless brushes have been ruined over the years. 　　Quite spreading a ten thousand-mouthed name, in a grand manner, indeed an official style. How, how is this please be safe? Bai Jiao of the Clouds bows his head.</p>
