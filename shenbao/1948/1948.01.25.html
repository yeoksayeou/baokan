<h3>張院長對外記者談話　改革弊制時機未熟　我外匯措施已能制止黑市</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京廿四日電〕張院長羣於廿四日下午單獨接見本社記者，表示中國實行幣判改革的時期尙未成熟，淮政府之考慮財政改革，已有相當長久的時期，政府各部會正起草措施，以應付中國目前的財政及經濟危機。張院長復謂，政府的外匯管制政策，不致變更，現行措施已能制止黑市之活動，俟最近中國香港所訂之防止走私協定充分發揮其效能後，外匯黑市交易即可完全消滅。外匯管制長時期可以適用，英國在目前財政危機中，實施此等管制，業已獲得成功。張院長談及美國之援助時表示，不論大小借款，均中國所最歡迎，張氏並曰，貝祖詒領導之中國技術顧問團，尙無報吿自華盛頓遞來，但該團已與國務部接觸，渠預料美國可望給予中國若干財政援助。張院長嗣又談及政府考慮中之新經濟計劃，指出爲維持本會計年度預算之平衡起見，若干限制具有絕對必要，必需品的輸入，當儘可能採用物物交換制度，以撙節外匯，政府並將努力擴大出口，必要時並將由政府在國內購辦物品輸往國外，若紐西蘭政府所爲者，中國將努力以求進出口之平衡，新訂之進出口計劃，大有助於平衡今年之預算。張院長被詢及穩定國幣所需之數額時，拒絕有所透露，並曰報端發表之佔計數字，純屬揣測之辭，不能代表政府之意見　渠謂：穩定國幣之計劃，尙在　密審査中，目前尙不能供給任何數字。述及可能的幣制改革時，張院長謂：政府在考慮中的改革制度有兩個以上，但渠不願說明中國將否採用金本位制度孔祥熙所建議者。張氏否認中國政府正興西哥政府談判購買白銀，渠云：「余自報端獲知此事以前，不知有此計劃，政府並未向墨西哥政府正式接洽，此又係揣測之辭」。張氏復證實中國之法幣發行額已超過廿八萬億元。最後張氏以信任的語氣表示，「中國前途光明，英國於戰時戰後，均已能克服其困難，中國於渡過目前危機後，亦必能愈趨强盛，惟中國人民尙須更事努力，表現如英國人民在困難期間所表現的奮鬥精神」。</p>

<h3>改革幣制與穩定物價</h3>
<p>通貨膨脹至如此　　的階段，固巳非改革幣制不足以挽救的了。近來改革幣制之說，甚囂張上，各方人士亦多有立刻改革的主張。改革幣制的最大目的，在於穩定幣值，而新幣值的能否穩定，改革按術的是否適當，固很重要，但改革的基本條件如何，更為重要。改革幣制固能有助於物價穩定，一般經濟狀態的重恢均衡，但並不是說，幣制改革了，一切經濟問題都能自動的根本解決，仍須有賴於對經濟各方面的積極設施。換言之，惟有良好基本條件的存在，改革幣制遂能有完滿的成功。否則，基本條件不利，改革恐將是徒勞的，即使能生效，至多亦　暫時性的。幣制改革，關係經濟前途至巨，故於基本條件應深加注意，當局亦應立下矯正經濟現勢的決心，俾與幣制改革措施相聯推行，始能收穩定物價復興經濟的實效。</p>
<p>過去當局對物價措施，雖屢更對策，但均無效，非但不能抑平物價，即物價漲勢亦不得緩和。在去年一年間，週期性漲風有三次，小漲風又有好幾次，物價不斷的上漲，上漲幅度擴大，休歇期間縮短，經濟為之騷擾無巳，人民生活亦不堪其威脅。即以現行的信用緊縮政策，雖較合理，然亦僅能生暫時之效。現在所採的信用緊縮政策：①停止國家行局的貸款，因貸款在工商界流通資金中所佔比例，殊為微小，賴貸款停止所能抽緊的銀根有限得很。②限制內匯，各地資金的大量匯集上海，促成銀根的泛濫，每為物價波動的一個主要動力；內匯限制了，銀根固能生緊縮之效，但在運現現象發生後，其效即為沖銷。③拋售物資，因數量較巨，所能抽緊的銀根亦較大，但終以數量有限，不能盡吸增發的通貨；假使拋舊物資，能盡吸增發的通貨，則財政赤字不必再以發行來應付，盡可以拋舊物資所得來抵補。④取締金鈔黑市，期能減少金鈔波動對物資的刺激，但金鈔黑市決非行政壓力所能徹底消滅，惟有賴於外匯政策的合理更改；取締無效，物價的騷擾因素僞為存在，若是取締有效，游資必盡轉向於商品市場。⑤檢查行莊業務，即使能生效，僅能控制社會資金的一小部分，其之效果不言可知。</p>
<p>物價問題如此嚴重，決非任何枝節措置所能奏效，即以現行的信用緊縮政策，亦僅能收暫時之效，無法持久的，所以我們可以說在法幣制度下，物價巳無　穩定。然經濟危機不容再為延續，急須設法挽救，所以改革幣制，實巳刻不容緩。幣制改革，雖可使經濟情勢有好轉之望，但亦並不是說改革了，物價問題就能根本解決，而臻於穩定之境。因為物價問題的促成因素，至為繁復，①財政赤字的過巨，②生產的減退，③外匯供需的失衡，以及④通貨流通速度的加快。這些癥結，確是不易解除，何能於幣制改革後即能自動的消除呢？因為幣制改革的本身，根本不能改善財政，增加外匯收入，只不過將危局緩和一下，以利解救工作的推進，在法幣制度下，則即此改進的機會都沒有了。</p>
<p>假使幣制改革後，不加以經濟情勢的根本矯正，則此改革將僅是單位的更改，有何意義呢？改制以後，通貨膨脹如若再為繼續，則物價仍是不能穩定的，因為通貨膨脹的終止，惟於根本癥結解除後，遂能實現的。改革幣制，是經濟上的一件重大工作，決不能在改革後，再任惡劣的經濟情勢破壞之，必須徹底的矯正經濟現狀，而助幣制改革的成功。我們對改革幣制，極為擁護，並亦願其速即成功，俾經濟能得走上復興的途徑，人民生活的威脅亦得解除。不過在幣制改革後的穩定物價上，　宜　加攷慮，茲願提出數點意見，以供參攷。</p>
<p>第一，穩定物價，並不是改革幣制後就能達到的，最要關　，仍在財政收支的能否平衡。所以改革幣制的第一個先決條件，是須積極整理財政，以達收支的平衡。幣制改革後，可使稅法比較切合實際情形，並因稅收購買力落後的免除，稅收可有實質上的增加；在支出方面可不復為物價波動而無限的擴增，預算數字接近實際需要，於財政收支狀況的改善，當是不無裨益。不過在現在的預算上看，即使物價完全穩定，預算嚴格執行，財政收支上留有巨大的差額。這個赤字數額如何彌補，確是一個很重要的問題，假使彌補不得其法，再由發行以抵補，則改革後的新幣制，過不了好久，又要走上膨脹之途。所以改革幣制，不過給財政收支以好轉的機會，而本身是不能改善財政的，我們必須積極的運用一切可能的方法，利用此好轉的時機，以達收支的平衡，再由財政收支的平衡，以鞏固新幣制的基礎。平衡財政收支，確非易事，我們必須下最大的決心，推行下列幾端的必要措施：①嚴格執行預算，使歲出狀況得能控制。②增闢新稅，以增稅收，不過新稅的負擔，應以富有階級為限，現今的避重就輕之提高間接稅率的辦法，是無濟於事的。③裁併駢枝機關，減少不必要支出，以利與歲入相接近。④財政上的赤字，不可再以發行來挹注，應即改採募債的政策；發行公債，在幣制改革後，亦不易順利，但如肯出較高的利息，亦能辦到的。⑤國庫向中央銀行的透支，祇可限以暫時性的短虧，且透支數額，亦須給以限制，始不致以影響通貨的膨脹。</p>
<p>第二，改革幣制的同時，須對匯率作合理的調整。調整不當，必將引起經濟的騷擾，而新幣制至終亦將歸於失敗。匯率定得太低，非但入超增加，外匯喪失，維持感於困難；且洋貨的大量進口，固能有助於國內物價的抑低，但工業又將陷於衰落之境。為適應今後的環境，新匯率與其高估，不如低估的為佳，低估可以節省外匯，而使幣制改革易於成功。匯率的調整，尚為技術問題，是否能獲持久的穩定，有待於國際收支狀況的合理調整。今後仍須採取嚴格的輸入管制，以減少外匯支出，積極　　出口和吸收僑　，以增外匯資金。尤要者，資金逃避須徹底阻止，以免國際收支平衡被其破壞。國際收支如若不得平衡，匯率雖為合理，亦終不得久長的穩定，匯率不穩定，物價何得穩定呢？匯價和物價雖互為因果而相循環的，但如匯價能得穩定，物價上亦可多得一個穩定的因素。</p>
<p>第三，目前的物資供需失衡，確亦為物價動盪上的一個主要因素。即使通貨停止增發了，匯價穩定了，物資的供不應求，仍然要破壞物價穩定的。為使物資供需均衡的重恢，惟由於增加生產和節約消費的一途。增加生產，首要於充裕原料的供應，其他的都不過是輔助的方法。我們要求當局限制製成品的進口，以及暫停非急需品的進口，將所有的外匯頭寸　量用於原料的進口，以解除當前的嚴重之原料缺乏恐慌。節約消費，非僅憑　令所能奏效的，必須切實的幹出來，遂能有裨於實際。再者，對於投機囤積等的人為需要，尤須切實的取締，至於取締決不能復如過去的，亂世須用重典，非此不足以取締有效。物資供應充裕了，在幣制改革之初，雖仍有少量發行的增加，膨脹趨勢即可由其抵制了，故在幣制改革上可起重大的作用。</p>
<p>第四，通貨流通速度的加快，由於人民對幣制喪失信心的結果。現今物價上漲程度的遠超通貨增發率，即由於此。流通速度如能減低，物價漲勢即可大為緩和。現時如此，在幣制改革時，更為重要，有人以為幣制改革了，通貨流通速度則能激減，然觀於現時人民對幣制的趣味不濃，將來恐亦難如理想。為求幣制改革時通貨流通速度的減退，尚須加以積極的措施。凍結部分的遊資，以減弱遊資的活動力量；提高利率，以緊縮信用；鼓勵工商業的增資，以吸部分遊資於生產。</p>
<p>總之，單靠改革幣制，而不從其他方面努力，改革仍難生效，故特提出這四點意見，作為改革幣制時施政的參考。</p>

<h3>緬駐華大使談話</h3>
<p>（上接一版）宇氏昨日在國際飯店接見記者，告稱：華僑在緬與緬甸人民非常友善，關係極為密切，多少年來從未發生任何糾紛，本人此來，即企求使兩國間人民更趨接近與友愛。渠並謂：目前華僑在緬約一百萬人，其中包括中緬混血者，彼等多數以開設店鋪為榮，亦有一部分為技師及木匠，華僑在緬教育程度亦頗高，可自由入任何學校，同時並設有國語學校。緬甸國內，識字者佔百分之九十五。</p>
<p>關於中緬貿易，宇氏表示戰後因交通困難，兩國間貿易額較戰前約減少一半，但渠相信以後必可增進，同時此次來華亦將盡力促使進步。　緬路現仍可通行，惜缺乏交通工具。緬甸過去向中國購買物資以棉紗為大宗，而中國進口緬貨物則以生棉最多，尚有糧食，為數不多。</p>
<p>宇氏又謂：緬甸在戰後遭遇最大困難，為缺乏交通工具，戰時鐵路被破壞，損失極重，此外勞工問題亦極嚴重，工資較戰前高四倍，至生產難以與其他國家競爭，至於衣食方面，尚可應付，據渠估計，復興緬甸，如【運氣好】則需五年，但最久亦不致超過十年。</p>

<h3>兩次標售未售出敵偽工廠優先承購承租辦法</h3>
<p>【本報南京廿三日電】蘇浙皖區敵偽產業清理處兩次標售未能售出之敵偽工廠，由後方復員工廠優先承購或承租辦法，經經濟部與中央信託局蘇浙皖區敵偽產業清理處修訂後，業經呈奉行政院修正核準，辦法如次：</p>
<p>①凡敵偽工廠及工廠設備，標售兩次以上未能售出者，得由後方復員工廠優先承購或承租。</p>
<p>②承購或承租人，以在抗戰時期對戰時生產確有貢獻之民營工廠，且須在本部登記有案者為限。</p>
<p>③承購或承租人之資歷，應由全國工業協會或遷川桂工廠聯合會予以證明，呈請經濟部核定之。凡二家或二家以上申請承購或承租同一敵偽工廠者，由上述二會擬定優先秩序，由經濟部參照核定承購或承租人，其優先次序以專業工廠較非專業者為第一優先，兩家以上聯合申請者較一家工廠單獨申請者為第二優先。</p>
<p>④遵照行政院令頒後方復員工廠承購或承租敵偽工廠之辦法，共分四項：①依照敵偽產業清理處估價，於一個月內一次十足付清。②依照清理處估價，於一個月內八折一次付清。③依照清理處估價，先付三分之一，三個月內再付三分之一，餘款於再三個月內付清。④承租辦法另條規定。</p>

<h3>英首相結束外交辯論　嚴辭譴責共產主義　決盡最大努力以消滅戰爭</h3>
<p>西歐聯盟並不排除世界他部份參加</p>
<p>【路透社倫敦廿三日電】艾德禮首相今日在下院外交辯論中致辭，表示不信戰爭即將爆發，但仍須盡最大努力，以消滅戰爭原因。艾德禮並重中貝文外相昨日在下院中聲明的保證，即建立歐洲聯盟的建議，並不排除世界其餘部份參加的可能性。艾德禮在歡呼聲中著重表示：【吾人不擬以我自由制度，強迫歐洲及世界他部人士接受，吾人同樣要求他人勿得強迫吾人接受其制度】。艾德禮嗣又直接述及史達林及共產主義，他說：【史達林固一實際主義者，當承認渠擬施之於英國之共產主義計劃已完成遭遇失敗。英國願意與蘇聯樹立最友好的關係，兩大民族間並無爭執，但英國人民不準備接受共產主義，且堅決反對共產主義的生活方式。史達林應放棄英國將成赤化的觀念，英國斷然反對共產主義的統一觀念。今日就人權方而言，蘇聯正排在行列的最後一端，民主的精華乃允許不同的意見從事自由討論，並容忍他人的意見。吾人理想的世界，為具有若干不同意見的單位的世界，而共產世界則欲使他國若保加利亞南斯拉夫等成為小俄羅斯。西歐為保持其立場以抗主義的攻勢起見，必須完成團結。但團結與統一不同，吾人茍具統一之念，將妨碍吾人之整個目標。吾人雖希望他國均能實行民主社會主義，然英國決不可加以干涉。然余相信彼等之主義雖不同，但具有一個共同的信念，即在近代世界上必須要有平衡的經濟，因此並不妨碍其共同的合作，十九世紀的【自由企業資本主義的無管制制度】今日已告死亡】。艾德禮綱述及馬歇爾方案，他說：【除去準備經由千百萬人之飢饉死亡，以實現其主義者外，余對其他人等之反對馬歇爾方案，百思不解。英國必有機會，以給予馬歇爾方案以偉大的領導，歐洲十六國會議不久可能重開會議，以使其觀念適合最近的局勢】。艾德禮繼又述及西歐聯盟的主張，渠云【建立西歐國家及其海外屬領的聯盟，乃人類空前的勇敢嘗試，歐洲聯盟在聯合國機構下較大的團結下完成，雖曰歐洲聯盟，但並不排除世界他部份參加的可能性】。艾德禮並透露建立歐關稅同盟的可能性，巳曾予以審查，現正在白魯塞爾通過其不能避免的技術性階段。</p>
<h3>建立西歐反蘇集團　美同意貝文計劃　認為足以奠定和平基礎</h3>
<p>【路透社華盛頓廿三日電】國務部今日發表正式聲明，同意英貝文外相團結西歐的建議，內稱，【貝文建議之措施，得使西歐自由國家從事更緊急的團結，以謀共同安全及福利，美國對此項建議深表歡迎。促進西歐物質上及精神上聯繫的任何建議，均足以加強英美兩國建立和平基礎的共同努力。此間認貝文計劃，為西歐反蘇集團的建立，此項主張以及邱吉爾之發出國際局勢俞益惡化之　告，可予支持馬歇爾方案者以更大之力量。】</p>
<p>貝文計劃之發表，適在國務部公布希特勒英洛托夫約之後，使兩個世界之對立形勢愈趨明顯。許多美國報紙均以地圖表明，【貝文集團】之地位，其狀態不亞於盟國與敵國在戰時對立的形勢，同時戰爭的談話，因此亦告復活，甚至有謂文林豪威爾之宣佈退出總統競選，即為準備於緊急時再度主持國防大計者。外交界人士並以貝文之演辭，與一九一九年三月納粹進佔普拉格後英相張伯倫之演辭相較，張伯倫之綏靖政策，自該次演說後即告廢棄。此間人士雖無指責貝文過去曾圖對蘇採取綏靖政策者，然過去英國之地位，固當以美蘇間之調人自居。</p>
<h3>比荷盧均贊同</h3>
<p>【路透社白魯塞爾廿三日電】比總理史巴克稱，貝文外相昨日發表之演講，乃世界史歐洲尤其是亞歐史上的記程碑，英法建議擴大鄧扣克盟約至於荷比盧，深得此間同情，正由負責當局考慮中。荷盧兩國對此亦表歡迎，三國政府不久可有機會，以比較關於此事之意見。本人對貝文所稱政治協定，必須輔以經濟協議之語，甚表贊成。貝文之言已發動有力之運動，會同馬歇爾方案可使歐洲迅速恢復平衡力量。</p>
<h3>瑞士決保守中立</h3>
<p>【路透社伯爾尼廿三日電】此間認貝文外相昨在下院中發表之演辭，係表示英國最後已承認歐洲之分裂。瑞士官員因此特聲明，瑞士決繼續保持中立。瑞士之經濟代表團已啓程赴莫斯科，謀促進兩國經濟聯繫，而同時英法之【馬歇爾方案】代表團將於週二來瑞士，由此可以顯示瑞士之絕對中立態度。瑞士官員並聲明瑞士之參加馬歇爾方案，係純粹基於經濟理由。</p>
<h3>英外交辯論　涉及對日和約</h3>
<p>【英國新聞處倫敦廿四日電】外相貝文在下院發表英外交政策時，曾特別提及未來對日和約一事。渠稱，此事甚難獲得蘇方同意，蓋蘇聯欲以對日簽訂和約一事應交外長會議討論。貝氏稱，【在蘇聯對日作戰以前，如蘇聯其時陳兵沿海諸省，或能發生影響，惟蘇聯實際對日作戰僅數日而已。而余要求諸君同意者，即對日始終作戰到底之國家，在盟國中應佔有優越地位。吾人所　擬者即為應包括十三或十四國而組成對日和約會議。】</p>
<p>【聯合社倫敦廿三日電】下院今日討論外交政策涉及遠東部份時，工黨議員巴登宣稱，美國對日政策應取得全世界民主國之擁護。保守黨議員戴林稱，英政府之審慎態度，已使日本方面英人處於恥辱地位，並使英國失去參加該國將來發展之機會。</p>
<h3>英美法三國會議　討論西德佔區合併問題　定下月中旬在倫敦舉行</h3>
<p>【路透社倫敦廿三日電】可靠方面息，英美法三國討論西德問題之會議，或將於二月十七至十九日間在倫敦舉行。英外部發言人謂，該會之中心問題將為依據最近弗蘭克福會議之決議，而討論西德之機構。法國對弗蘭克福決議持有異議，屆時自當在會中討論。發言人並曰此會如能產生即時效果，可予西德以克服現狀的良機。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾放棄　早締奧和約希望</h3>
<p>【合眾社華盛頓廿四日電】馬歇爾二十四日接受前底德律銀行家現任談判奧和約之助手道奇之辭呈，故馬帥業已放棄早日締結對奧和約之希望。</p>
<h3>蘇要求美修改　戰時租借條件　並考慮蘇戰時勝利功績</h3>
<p>【合眾社莫斯科廿三日電】據塔斯社華盛頓訊：蘇聯已提出建議，要求美國【全盤考慮】蘇陸軍對此次大戰勝利之功績，而修改解決戰時二百億借租法案之條件。按蘇聯已於十二月十六日向美國提出照會一件，建議締結關於此事之協定。</p>
<h3>匈羅簽訂　互助條約</h3>
<p>【本報訊】倫敦廿五日廣播：布達佩斯訊，匈牙利與羅馬尼亞已簽訂廿年友好軍事互助條約，規定對任何攻擊者，必須採取聯合軍事行動。</p>
<h3>法政府不顧英國反對　決議將法郎貶值</h3>
<p>克利浦斯抵巴黎與梅逸會談</p>
<p>【路透社巴黎廿四日電】法政府已於廿四日決定法郎之貶值，並建立黃金及若干外幣之自由市場，公報宣布，內閣會談已通過向國民議會提出法案規定有關黃金外幣市場之規則。法國之法郎制度是否已有修改以應付英國之　對尚不可知，法政府發言人僅曰：英方談判者對法國之局勢表示極度善意及諒解，英法代表團人士對克利浦斯與梅逸今晨會談內容嚴守秘密，克利浦斯定今日下午會晤梅逸財長。</p>
<h3>美工商團體　一致擁護援歐</h3>
<p>【聯合社華盛頓廿三日電】美國工業組織大會執行委員會今日再度聲明擁護馬歇爾援歐計劃，並擔保六百萬會　將在反通貨膨脹前綫與工資前綫，作正面進攻。</p>
<p>【聯合社華盛頓廿三日電】全國廠商協會與經濟開發委員會今日聯合促請馬歇爾援歐計劃脫離國務部管轄。兩團體並與美國勞工聯合會主席葛林一致担保充分支持援歐計劃完成其目標。</p>
<h3>艾帥堅決拒絕　競選美總統</h3>
<p>范登堡杜威呼聲又盛</p>
<p>【合眾社紐約州阿爾木尼城廿四日電】艾森豪威爾元帥堅決表示不擬競選總統，紐約共和黨人士廿四日認為紐約州長杜威之獲選為共和黨候選人巳成定局。雖杜威通過其新聞秘書宣佈對此【無意見】，杜派人士毫不隱瞞其樂觀情緒，政府高級領袖發表意見，以為艾帥之退出，可能消滅麥克阿瑟元帥獲提名之威脅，蓋艾帥拒絕聲明中同時警告軍人不得捲入政治。</p>
<p>【合眾社紐約廿三日電】紐漢浦歇洲孟撤斯特【聯合導報】發行人樊德爾廿三日指出，艾森豪威爾雖宣佈拒絕競選總統，其擁護者仍將繼續代為提名候選。</p>
<p>【聯合社華盛頓廿四日電】陸軍參謀長艾森豪威爾聲明謝絕提名為共和黨總統候選人後，共和黨參議員范登堡呼聲又起。惟范氏本人曾聲明非得其同意，不能硬派，惟亦曾謂，如　以總統候選人加於其身，亦無人能推辭。</p>
<h3>麥帥對帥聲明　不表示意見</h3>
<p>【合眾社東京廿四日電】麥克阿瑟元帥廿四日語會　社稱，渠對艾森豪威爾元帥拒絕競選總統之文告【並無批評】。如是則艾帥聲明對麥帥之地位似尚無立即之影響。一般觀察家認為麥帥係採取【靜觀以待其後】之立場。然在佔領軍人員中之崇拜麥帥者，認為艾帥既表示職業軍人不應窺總統之神器，實係阻撓麥帥之可能雄　。麥帥之名巳被錄入韋斯康辛州總統初選名單，雖麥帥尚未聲明願意出為候選人。渠至今堅稱　留日本以待佔領　務之終了。然渠從未宣稱，　共和黨推渠為總統候選人，渠將加以拒絕。</p>
<h3>魏德邁將軍　授永久少將銜</h3>
<p>【合眾社華盛頓廿三日電】美參議院今日一致通過，魏總邁中將　授　久　將銜。</p>
<h3>英請美出面調解　印巴間糾紛</h3>
<p>美政府已予以拒絕</p>
<p>【中央社成功湖廿三日人眾電】可靠方面訊，美政府巳拒絕英國邀請其出面領導推動聯合國解決印度與巴基斯坦糾紛。據稱，美官員認為美國於安理會正圖結束此項爭端之際，不應出面，咸信美國因印巴爭執，與其外交政策利益無密切關係，故未在安理會上採取積極行動。英國認為印巴事件，較巴勒斯坦事件尤為善變，除非美國出面領導　擬可為印巴雙方接受面不致　　方損失體面與權力之計劃，否則安理會或將無法解決糾紛。</p>
<p>【聯合社成功湖廿四日電】聯合國安理會討論印度與巴基斯坦糾紛，今日巳近表決階段。據悉，喀什米爾主權誰屬問題，將由該邦人民自決。</p>
<h3>美英擬在地中海　建立空軍基地鍊</h3>
<p>【路透社倫敦廿三日電】據悉英美代表已會在倫敦討論在北非西倫奈加建立英美空軍基地鋉之暫定計劃，主要者將在班加齊區，而杜勃魯克附近亦將有若干基地之建立。</p>
<p>該地戰時之埃爾亞登飛機場，今尚存在，自巴勒斯坦撤退之英軍，或將移駐塞浦魯斯，班加齊，及的黎波里，此等新基地或將小於美國在的黎波里附近海拉雅重開之空運基地，任何基地之未來，均將視四強外長代表對議前　領成立之決議而定。惟在西倫奈加建立基地，縱屬暫時性者，對於維持英美在東地中海之控制，以及通至中東油區之交通綫，均有極大用處。俟英國退出聖地，在東非建立永久基地前，北非之基地將佔有極重要之地位。</p>
<h3>德伐里亞省百萬工人　總罷工已告結束　克返國催促撥款運糧</h3>

<p>【路透社華盛頓廿三日電】德境美軍總司令克萊今日在此透露，渠此次返國為要求國會批準撥款七億元，以增加德境英美合併區之糧食平均配給量至每人每日一千八百卡洛里之熱量。　萊並認目前　爾之工潮，雖將引誘共產勢力之侵入合併區，然亦可刺激德政治領袖負起迫使德農人出售其糧食之責任。</p>

<h3>介紹【赫爾回憶錄】</h3>
<p>— 本報譯室</p>
<p>本報決定從明天起，逐日分段刊載【赫爾回憶錄】。</p>
<p>這本書，在美國尚未出版，也還沒有發表過，要從本月廿六日起，才由【紐約時報】開始刊登，分四十二天登完。全文在四十二天之前，不致有專書出版。負責辦理【赫爾回憶錄】發行事宜的紐約編輯人新聞社（Editors　Press　Service）重視本報在中國悠久的歷史和讀者的眾多，特將上海的獨家發行權交給了本報。該社為了發表日期的　術問題，又屢經函電往返，最初該社決定本報應於廿六日起與【紐約時報】同時開始發表，其後又認為可以提前於廿四日刊登，最後還是決定廿六日。該社對於發表的日期也一絲不茍，屢經斟酌，可見對該稿的重視。事實上，是同日發表，但上海時間要比紐約時間為早，所以本報讀者要比美國讀者早看到這本煌煌巨著，這不能不說是本報一點小小的貢獻，也不能不說是讀者的一件幸事。</p>
<p>赫爾於一八七一年生於田納西州。一八九一年離開大學之後，就在本州做律師，並且擔任田州的立法議會議員。一九○七年出任國會議員，一九三一年轉入參議院，他的議會生涯，前後達整整廿四年。一九三三年，故羅斯福總統邀請他出來擔任國務卿的要職，負起美國外交政策的重任，他的國務卿任期，長達十二年之久，比美國歷史上其他任何一個國務卿的任期來得長，一直到一九四四年才為了辛勞過度體力衰弱而退休的，在他擔任國務卿的十二寒暑中，正當世界風雲最緊張的一個時期，墨索里尼做著恢復羅馬帝國的迷夢，希特勒正在中歐耀武揚威兼併鄰邦，而日本帝國主義者在搶奪了我國的東北之後，猶在不斷　軍蠢然思動，終於使第二次世界大戰無可避免地爆發。其後幸賴聯合國家的團結一致，粉碎了侵略者的妄想，奠定了戰後合作的初步基礎。這一切的內幕經過，赫爾以美國國務卿的身份，當然是明瞭得極徹底的。</p>
<p>【赫爾回憶錄】可以說是他政治外交生活的結晶。全文並不作硬性的分段，大部份根據時間的先後，把當時與美國外交有關的國際重要事件，逐一敘述，並隨時參酌他個人的批評和感情。他把客觀的事實，作主觀的追敘，因此無論在內容上和體裁上都備見活潑，仿佛使呆板的史實，獲得了一個對生動的靈魂。文中對於美國歐戰態度的變遷，日美談判的經過，以及聯合國機構的誕生等，都有極詳盡的記載，但是以他個人的活動為中心，所以特別顯得有聲有色，愛憎分明。至於關於他私生活方面的敘述，像他和羅斯福總統的關係，對於當時政府要人的批評，以及應付外交人物的風度等，說來尤其坦白細膩，娓娓動聽。文筆是樸素的，但是在平淡之中，富有熱情，蘊藏力量，令人誦讀之餘，會感到比讀正史更有味，更親切。</p>
<p>我們覺得這本書最值得重視的，計有兩點：第一，赫爾是以自動退休的國務卿的身份寫的，和一般政治生涯還沒有結束的政治家所寫的作品，頗有不同。具有野心的政治家往往喜歡把自己已往的作為渲染一番，有時甚至不惜歪曲事實，他卻不必；年輕的從政者為了未來事業上的種種顧慮，或者避免人家誤會起見，不能把想說的話盡量傾吐出來，他却不然；以他已往顯赫的成就和七十五歲的高齡，盡可以把事實真相說得一明二白，毫無顧忌。第二，他雖然是羅斯福的國務卿，但在美國外交政策的決定和推行方面，並非僅僅是總統的傳聲筒。他在受任國務卿的時候，就向總統說明【我並不願意僅僅替總統向外國政府傳達傳達消息，我要在訂定和實施外交政策方面，充分參與其事】。總統也的確尊重他的意見，事實上，他和羅斯福總統對國際事務的見解，是如此接近，往往不謀而合。所以，就是我們說他是羅斯福時代美國外交政策的實際策劃者和推行者，也並不過份。【回憶錄】的內容，對於美國這一時代外交政策的來蹤去跡，的確提供了彌足珍貴的資料。</p>
<p>我們在讀過全文之後，覺得作為外交家的赫爾，具有若干重要特色：①赫爾是重視國際間經濟關係的外交家。他在擔任國會議員期間，是議會中在關稅和國內稅則方面極有名的專家，他在受任國務卿之後，就把國際間的關稅關係——也就是經濟關係——看做他外交政策的重要一環。他認為【經濟戰爭是政治戰爭的根本原因，貿易上的歧視消滅，戰爭的可能性就可以隨之減少】。他在卅六歲那一年第一次向國會發表演說時，就力主國際間減低關稅壁壘，減少貿易限制，但是直到六十二歲那一年才最後獲得成功，在國會中通過了貿易協定法案，艱苦奮鬥達廿六年之久。但是在其後的幾年中，戰爭在非洲，亞洲和歐洲相繼爆發，所以或許有人要說：【你看，貿易協定並沒有能夠防止戰爭啊。】赫爾回答說【是的，雖然簽訂了不少貿易協定，戰爭還是來了。但是美國與我們能夠和它簽訂貿易協定的任何國家之間沒有發生戰爭，這是事實。除了極少數的例外，凡是我們能夠和它們簽訂貿易協定的國家，都聯合起來反抗軸心，這也是事實。政治上的聯繫是以經濟上的聯繫為依歸的】。這種真知灼見，誰能否認它是國際關係上的一大真理。</p>
<p>②赫爾是一個現實的外交家。他一生中始終殷切期望持久和平能夠造福世界，造福人類，所以獲得了【和平老人】的雅號，但是他決不是盲目的【和平論者】。一九三四年間，當世界局勢日益緊張起來的時候，他第一個主張增強美國自衛力量。當時高唱世界和平或者主張美國實行孤立政策者，大有人在，但是赫爾却認清了兩點：第一，希特勒，墨索里尼和日本帝國主義者是無可理喻的，世界和平不是不需要而是不可能，口頭高唱和平，適足以增強侵略者的氣焰，鬆懈民主國家的自衛努力。第二，世界是一體，和平是不可分的，實行孤立政策，等於讓興國落入侵略者的虎口，自己最後也不免成為侵略的犧牲品。明乎此，所以他竭力和虛偽的和平論者與短視的孤立主義者作戰，主張以現實的態度，來應對現實的國際局勢。他有一句名言就是說：【我國人民不但不為可以作戰而感到太自傲，而在　備某幾種條件之下將為不需要作戰而感到太自傲】。切實誠懇，莫過於這句說話。</p>
<p>③赫爾是一個富有理想的外交家。在第二次世界大戰期間，他無疑是一個主戰論者，這是出於現實的需要，不得不然。事實上，他所以竭力主張和侵略者作戰，目的無非是希望持久和平終獲實現。他和羅斯福總統一樣，是一個有理想，有抱負的偉人，他一生中親歷兩次大戰，親見人與人兩次大屠殺的慘劇，深切感到單是打勝了這次戰爭，是沒有用的，更重要的是要爭取持久和平。他稟承了羅斯福總統的意志，再加上他自己的創造意識，計劃了一個世界組織。赫爾之被稱為【聯合國之父】，其故在此。他說：【聯合國不反對其他國家集團的一個聯盟，而是反抗侵略者的聯盟，不是戰爭的聯盟而是和平的聯盟。但是我們不要希望聯合國創造奇蹟，它的　意是人類思想的產物，不是完美的。這個組織假如要有效地發揮其功能，需要時間，忍耐和國際間的合作精神，尤其需要蘇·英·中·法·美五大國的繼續協辦……】。讀這幾句說話，仿佛聽到了一個長者告誡青年人的聲音，無限熱情，　然紙上。</p>
<p>【郝爾回憶錄】的詳細內容，勢非一篇短短的介紹文字所能說盡，須要讀者逐日耐性地閱讀原文。我們第一當力求譯文的忠實，其次當力求譯筆的流暢，並望讀者隨時批評與指正。</p>

<h3>立委選舉啓箱計票　區城開出十三萬張　今起決提早時間增加人員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市立委選舉，自昨日起在市參議會與市商會兩處分別開票。區域選舉票箱一百二十六隻，前日晚間已集中市參議會存放。昨晨九時廿五分，吳兼主委國楨　塲，張曉崧陳保泰等亦先後抵達。九時半，市長登台宣佈開始計票。開票所主任陳敏書隨即報吿開票手續及廢票之認定，並稱：爲求大公無私，選務所曾函知各候選人派代表在內住宿監視，日間開票時得在塲外監督，塲內則僅開票職員及新聞記者得自由出入。市長尋即離塲，開票工作遂即進行。</p>
<p>昨日之開票至午後六時半始吿結束。計開啓票箱十四隻，其中提籃橋區兩隻，眞如區兩隻，吳淞區一隻，靜安區四隻，普陀區三隻，盧灣區一隻，北站區一隻。共開出十三萬餘票。工作人員在六十以上，共分九組進行。候選人派代表留宿監視者，有謝仁釗，鄭毓秀，馬君碩三人。謝仁劍前夜即派代表一人留住，後兩人之代表於昨日前往。昨日各候選人之得票名次及票數如下：</p>
<p>王新衡　二五一一一票</p>
<p>鄭毓秀　一八八七五票</p>
<p>馬君碩　一八四五八票</p>
<p>曹俊　一七七一七票</p>
<p>方志超　一四一八一票</p>
<p>顏惠慶　一四〇〇一票</p>
<p>馬樹禮　六一四六票</p>
<p>王劍鍔　五八一四票</p>

<p>朱文德　八四票</p>
<p>周一志　六五票</p>
<p>趙芝玫　五九票</p>
<p>冀翹　三二票</p>
<h3>廢票千餘張　有人選黃巢</h3>
<p>昨日之廢票共計一一八四票，多爲畫圈在兩候選人姓名之間，不易辨認者。或圈在候選人姓名之下，無法區別其用意者。此外吳淞區第三投票所，有兩票推選「黃巢」，並附打油詩一首，說明選黃巢之理由，大意爲黃巢英勇，能把壞人殺光云云。提籃橋區之票箱內，亦開出滿紙牢騷之信一紙，認爲競選無意義，主張應將競選宣傳費捐作冬令救濟經費。</p>
<h3>戢冀聲明放棄　未向選總手續</h3>
<p>昨日因開票較遲，故開出之票數較少，今起決提早開票時間爲上午九時，並設法增加人力。關於民社滅主委候選人戢翼翹在選舉前聲明放棄一節，張局長曉崧認爲戢氏僅在報上刋登廣吿，並未向選總辦理手續，本市選務處並未奉到總事務所之指示，因此在法律上，自應照其他候選人一體辦理。好在候選人當選後，不論正式或候補，選舉事務所均需正式徵詢其是否願意當選，屆時自可表白其意見。</p>
<h3>高級船員選舉　尚無解決辦法</h3>
<p>高級船員之駕駛，輪機，無綫電員，引水等技師，自奉南京職婦選所令飭另案辦理後，曾發生將船員證書繳還上海航政局之糾紛。後經該局再三勸慰，始由高級船員各團體贊負責人將證書千餘張暫代收回保管。茲悉航政局昨已去電交通部報吿並請示辦法。然今日尙有多數船員至該局繳還證書，並有今日到埠各輪之高級船員紛向各高級船員團體，要求向選所作最有效之抗議。</p>
<h3>國民黨黨團員　登記展期三天</h3>
<p>國民黨上海市黨部自辦理黨團員重新登記以來，申請登記之黨團員，約在七萬人以上，原定本月廿五日爲截止期，茲據黨部負責辦理登記人員稱：爲免少數黨團員向隅起見，決定展延三天，至本月廿八日止，屆時不再延期。</p>

<h3>職業團體票匭　先開工商農敎　圈於姓名下方之票　一至決定認作有效</h3>

<h3>兵役會議　改期舉行　因徐署長未到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕原定於今日舉行之本市兵役會議，現因國防部兵役署長徐思平尙未來滬，改於本月三十日舉行。民政局姚文瑛科長稱：徐局長現赴湘鄂視察役政，屆時徐氏如不及來滬，則須延至下月初舉行。蓋本市今年征兵方式，開征日期及籌款方式，均須徐氏抵滬後會商決定云。</p>
<h3>服業年獎問題　斷會商定原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西服，皮鞋，時裝等業職業工人要求年終獎金問題，經社會局移送勞資評斷會處置後，昨日評斷會小組會中曾加商討。因資方認爲並無前例』而勞方則堅決要求發給，爲免致糾紛擴大起見，經商定原則，由總工會及商會分別勸導勞資雙方，由資方另以其他名義發給職工一筆金額，而不稱爲年終獎金。該一原則尙待吳主任委員核准，並需繼續詳商辦法。</p>
<h3>意圖陷人於罪　兩工頭被起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新閘橋西米碼頭工頭黃柏森及盧春池，因犯誣告非，昨經地檢處提起公訴。據起訴書略稱：工人沈寳善·陳如洪·孫連池·成喜來·張成洪等，聯絡工人開會，意欲向黃柏森淸查賬目，黃爲先發制人計，串同盧春池爲證人，誣稱沈等五人有異黨嫌疑，向國防部第二廳駐滬某單位密吿，由某單位發交本市警察局査辦。於去年十二月二十四日，黃盧偕同警局人員，密携事先製就之大批反動標語傳單，於檢査時放於沈等住宅內，藉詞將沈等五人拘捕。經警局調査黃。盧有誣吿罪嫌，移送地檢處偵查屬實，依刑法第二十八條，刑法第一六九條第一項第二項提起公訴。</p>

<p>換紗改訂標準　由於存放困難</p>
<p>首由侯供稱：聯總配與行總之電風扇，因不合救濟之用，故公開標賣，結果由正誼商行以每把三十五萬六千元標得一部份，嗣又標售，因無人投標。遂改在門市部公開售賣，門市售出多少，已記不淸楚，六月停止出售原因，係淸査存貨。此時曾接到各機關申請配售公函五百多封，因擬留二千把爲行總衛生處之用，曾下一手諭給文書科，對所有申請者均不予答覆以免麻煩。停售時有多少電扇，亦記不淸楚。至於美棉換紗原訂標準爲美棉六百七十磅交換二十支紗四百磅，但行總以美棉七百六十磅交換二十支紗四百磅，聯總中國局棉紗部主任卡漢斌初雖在會議席上反對，經解釋後，亦無異議，此係因棉花存放，離於保險，並非託詞。</p>
<p>愚園路屋·並非贈送</p>
<p>配售棉紗之行號，是由輸出入管理委員會開來二十餘家名單，根　此項名單訂立合同羊毛配給興安樂紡織廠獨多，並無收受回扣情形，愚園路　三九六號房屋並非鄧仲和贈送，此屋係吳志衛向鄧租用，轉租與我，定期二年，租金美鈔七百二十元，一次付淸，有吳致鄧函件爲證。</p>
<p>嗣訊董承道，供稱：關於分配電風扇，非我業務範圍內之事，情形不淸楚，鄧仲和是否贈送侯藹昌房屋一幢，亦不知道。</p>
<p>文書科長陶景瑗供稱：配售電風扇，係奉命行事，各機關申請配售不予答復原因，由於侯總經理條論，命拒絕一切聲請。</p>
<p>獨家配售·羊毛原因</p>
<p>鄧仲和供稱：愚園路房屋係租給吳志衛，由吳轉租與侯，有吳函件以資證明。至於羊毛配售與本廠獨多原因，有一時期許多廠方不肯購買，且別家常開空頭支票，惟本廠大量收購，且從不退票蔣仁麟供稱：在福利科長任內，曾動用備用金五百萬元，惟此係修理行總瑞豐里宿舍之用，是用於公，而非私自侵吞，經手用款均有發票，惟未公開招標，手續稍有欠缺。</p>
<p>杜岑供稱：副總稽核係代總稽核審査一切賬目，專員陳倜民向錦昌祥致記及華　號購買傢具，事先未經審核，手續確有朱備，惟此係某稽核批准，本人事後方知。</p>
<p>購買傢具·手續欠妥</p>
<p>胡可時供稱：購買傢具事先未經稽核，稍有欠妥，但因此項傢具，係零碎購進，最後彙總送稽核室審査，此係事實上之困難。</p>
<p>龐元龍供稱：瑞豐里宿舍之冰箱，係父親購買，惟已無法提出證據。</p>
<p>證人吳志衛則稱：愚園路房屋係由我向鄧租下，轉租與侯，曾給鄧函一件，吿知經過情形。</p>

<p>所有該項飾物現保管於中國銀行保管箱中，敵僞產業淸理處爲其處理問題大傷腦筋，蓋如採取標賣方式，必須任人看樣，但飾物體積小而價値鉅，萬一稍有疏忽而發生偸竊掉換等情形，職員方面無人敢負此責，故該處最近擬用委託中央儲蓄會發行獎券辦法，原則已在呈請行政院中核示中，惟飾物種類價値不一，將來即使實行此一辦法，恐亦尙有一番週折。最近自發行獎券之消息傳出以後，外界對此發生興趣者大不乏人，甚至外埠方面已有人先行匯款預約，頗使該處負責人應付爲難云</p>
<p>最大鑽石重卅克拉　擬發獎券舉行標賣</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕福建中路四十七弄八號開設泰玻璃號之陳春生，又名陳麻皮，（見岡）卅歲，南京人，因長袖善舞，營業年有盈餘，不意去年上春二月，弄口二號忽有常州人承泉林，卅四歲，創設泰昌祥玻璃號，因此陳之生意，日見衰落，懷恨在心，曾一度糾衆前往承之號中，企圖搗毀，結果被處罰賠償。</p>

<h3>建設嵊泗列島　董賛堯廳長　對本報記者談　新舊漁業</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿三日訊〕嵊泗列島，不特是江蘇省的唯一漁區，同時也是全國四大漁場之一，地居東海國防最前線，在　事上也　重要。戰前　魚的數量，每年約達二千多萬元的數額，如能用新式方法捕撈，　量當更為可觀。該島原屬崇明五區，蘇省府因鑒於該區的重要，特於上午改設設治局，更爲積極開發該島復組織嵊泗建設委員會，以期積極建設，上週建設廳長董贊曉氏，邀同農林部周次長，連袂同赴該島視察，歷時半月，昨始返省。頃據輩廳長對記者談稱，該島人口，平時約有二萬四千多人，每到漁汎時期，便增加至十餘萬人，現有漁船三千八百餘隻，漁輪也有數十艘，過去均爲一般不肖的漁棍所把特。自省府下令拘捕後，漁棍現已絕跡，惟去年遭受空前風災，僅春間帶魚汎產量，便由三十萬斤驟减至五萬斤，損失奇重，影響漁民生活甚鉅，目前正在積極建設的事業如下：</p>
<p>鹽　問題，刻已商得鹽務局同意，在該島設立鹽倉兩所，經常儲鹽量爲四千担。</p>
<p>漁貸　問題，該島一般漁民，大都家無餘貯，且受高利貸的剝削，以致　濟極端困難，實爲復興漁業的重大阻礙，現正調査出漁資本，商請中農　辦理低利漁貸。</p>
<p>糧食　問題，該島係屬漁區，向不產米，糧食素感缺乏，現已代爲設法請領運米護照，以便購運。</p>
<p>交通　問題該島孤懸海外，交通不便，例如郵件寄遞，必須由浙江岱山轉去，費時十餘日，始能達到，今後擬調置交通船，以暢交通。</p>
<p>漁港　問題建築嵊山漁港極爲迫切需要，因爲該處形勢雖尙優良，但每遇風雨變遷時，往往有趨避不及之虞，並且在漁汎時期，蘇，浙，閩三省的漁船，都麕集該處，誠能就該處建築漁港，則天然災害，可以避免不過工程甚大，一時不易完成，現在先想將橫在避風要道中的三礁炸去，以减危險。</p>
<p>飲料　問題，當然是島民的很大問題，現擬在可能範圍內，多建蓄水池，並設法　井，以解決居民飲水的困難。</p>
<p>造林　問題，該島樹木很少，四山荒廢，現正督導提倡造林運動，期使荒島綠化，他如提倡漁村副　如織網，造船等，均在建設計劃之中。今後更有急待解決的問題，就是</p>
<p>漁船　改良問題，在　式潐船進入親式漁輪的過程中，應當造一種什麼樣的漁船，是漁民們最實用，最歡迎而生產能力最强的工具。這個問題很大，而且必須加以硏究。現在漁民因太船太小，只能在近海捕撈，稍遠地區，以船中不能炊食，搖近魚羣，則已腹　力竭，雖可勉鼓餘力，但仍須將船搖回，則全力多巳消耗於來去途中，其能施於捕魚者極微，途中一遇</p>
<p>風暴　則鮮有生還者。故遠海有角不能去捕，而近海則守株待兎，無多魚可捕，漁民一年到有半年是閒在家裏，不是他們不能生產，而是技術方面亟待改進。本人此次在嵊，親至附近各島訪問，並與老漁夫詳談，目前最適　需要的工具，多數意見均主張用舊式揹舢舨，（係一種大魚船，船上可揹兩隻舢舨船，此船可禦風浪。）以之加大製造，每船約一三十噸，添製五十匹馬力發動機，每船揹舢舨四隻，以兩船爲一對，用爲</p>
<p>母船　每日並可另拖多數小船，往較遠深海取魚，除各小船及所揹小舢板均能各自捕撈外，母船一對，可作日本式手操網漁輪用，遇有魚羣或暴風，均由母船發出信號，以憑趨避，並備武器，以爲保護。回時，仍由母船拖回，如是每次可取魚三四百担，而工作漁民，可達五十餘人，一對船即可解決五十餘家生活，每日即可生產八九億元，較之新式漁輪，更爲便利。因新式</p>
<p>漁輪　每月最多出海捕漁兩次，每次捕撈，經常僅二萬餘斤，最多亦不過四萬餘斤，而所費甚鉅，於漁民無所補益，更不能談救濟，董氏現正邀集漁業及造船專家，開始試製兩對，以舊式漁業，進入新式漁　之改進，並爲沿海漁民眞正之救濟，同時，並已商得漁管處趙處長之贊助，將來可以大量製造，以期减少今後此後漁民之困難。（本報記者和香林）</p>
<h3>蘇省號召寒衣運動　一甲一衣</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿四日電〕　蘇省保安政治部，頃特發起勸募寒衣運動，定廿八日邀請各鄕鎭長協助，挨戶勸募，以達成「一甲一衣」之目標。　蘇省府以現値戡亂時期，今特代電各縣市政府轉飭所屬，今後接待一切賓客及召集會議，不可使用茶點，以資節約。　省　二察局，定廿五日起舉行戶口總淸査，無國民身份證者，將受違警處分。　省府今接奉行政院令以各地糧價波動甚劇，糧食來源阻塞，實爲主要原因，各地方政府及軍警部隊對於糧商運銷糧食，凡合於糧食管制法令規定之內，均應切實協助，不得藉故留阻，省府奉命後，已分令各專員縣長切實遵照。　省臨參會今駐會委會決議：（一）建議中央加强新兵訓練，改善新兵生活，以提高人民服役興趣，（二）請省府緩征糧食營業稅。</p>

<h3>台省產糖區蔗農福音　流動銀行車開始工作</h3>
<p>〔本報台北廿二日航訊〕記者二十日下午參觀了排成一行列的流動銀行車，這是工商銀行新設的也是獨創的設施。據該行董事長黃朝琴語記者，這個流動銀行主要是深入中南部的蔗農區域，爲糖業公司各工廠解決發放糖款的困難，同時也爲蔗農服務，更爲該行本身擴展存儲業務，增加銀行的存款額。</p>
<p>跟着通貨膨脹，一個普通的蔗農，在製糖時期都可以獲得百萬以上的現款，多的在幾億以上。照糖業公司分糖法的規定，假令種蔗一百斤，可製糖十斤，蔗農可得五斤，其中百分之二十可取現貨，百分之八十可取得現款，這現款是一千斤蔗，公司方面先墊付四千元，這從十二月十日起需要在四月底發淸。工商銀行担當了十四個糖廠的放款業務，總數在二百億以上，可能到三百億。設如虎屋糖廠，有三十億的放款，每次發放蔗農三千人，這個可觀的數目，要是銀行不能就地直接辦理存放，則各方面都感到困難，所以該行特　備了流動車，利用週密的公路網，深入到蔗農區。在台南設立了總機構，虎尾，嘉義，屛東設分機構，流動車在規定或蔗農指定的日期，區域裏輪流施發。</p>
<p>銀行方而特別以二月的時問訓練了行員和鄕村衝要地區訓練了臨時點鈔的雇員，當每一輛車，（該車有行員二人，經理一人，臨時行員十六至二十人，司機亦有工作，）深入蔗區時，一而利用車輛就地發款，一面還予宣傳，演講和訪問。</p>
<p>台胞有存款的好習慣，可是以他們第一期辦理的情形來看，成績並不好，主要的是蔗農辛苦了年半，稍得現款，總要安放着熱一下心，所以存款成績第一天祗是百分之一，可是以這許多現款放着總不能放心，所以二三天存款數即見增加，第四天已達百分之十一。</p>
<p>銀行方面是不希望大宗款項被　　　，使繙加紙幣的印刷費或囤積居奇　數物復的作用的，所以希望存款　行，問題在如許數項，是否紙是便利了銀行的還用呢？據費訴是這款是規定了　作復興農村和生產事業之用的，同時這個直接存款，也足以測驗民衆對銀行的信仰，以及商人得存款後表露的經濟現象。</p>
<p>銀行當局臨時調用了四百個行員，辦理流動銀行的業務，本月廿四廿五將在南部召開分行行員大會討論說明，因爲這畢竟是新興的事業，需要民衆們理解。</p>
<p>採用這一個方式使銀行深入鄕村，這對蔗農實是福音，但該行董事長說，糖業公司若能運用像美國的辦法，不必採取存放辦法，使蔗農都能使用簡捷的劃付或直接支付法，當可使銀行省却更多的人力財力，因爲事實上最具經驗的行員，每天祇能點數三百萬元的鈔票！</p>
<p>從廿一日起，這十二輛流動銀行車將全部分散到中南部產糖區，希望治安能帮助和保陣流動車的安全，成功！</p>

<h3>南昌閙市　寳慶銀樓遭刦　五雙金鐲不翼而飛</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌廿二日航訊〕南昌市熱鬧市街中山路上，十九日華燈初上時發生一樁金號被刧事件，這是本市實施冬防後的一樁大案子，被刧的金號，—寳慶銀樓，位置在中山路與翠花街口，是南昌市最熱閙的所在，當時有一個身着中山服，外罩灰在大衣的僞裝購金鐲客，手提着一個藍布防空袋，走近該號的櫃台邊，申稱要買金鐲。店夥看看他的外表，不像豪客，但是望望他手提的防空袋，又似乎滿裝着鈔票。他們爲防萬一計，請這位客人，進人會客室談生意，拿出五個金鐲子，他左看右檢，將五隻鐲子緊握在左手，掏出手槍往外逃跑。店夥緊抓着他的大衣，亦被「拍」的槍聲，嚇倒在地。那位不速的客人，就乘隙外逃，接連開二槍，向着翠花大街逃，一脚不慎，跌了一咬，爬起又路。　　金號五個金鐲，就在刹那間，被不速之客搶刧而去。全市各金號聞訊，立即閉市嚴防，蓋因這位當衆搶刦的匪徒，進入到寳慶金號之先，曾經走看過幾家，因其他金號謹愼處事，未與接談。刦案發生後，寳慶金號檢查刦犯留下的防空袋，內裝六捆紙錢，由此判斷刦犯係有計劃的幹這樁買賣，並且事後調査，其他幾家金號，當這位手提防空袋的匪犯，向他們接談時，門口似乎還有四五人在外佈置，據今日下午負責偵察機關的消息，刦犯口操南昌口音，迄無綫索，省府秘書長宋相成對此案力主軍法處置，如獲破案，決不送法院，立予槍決。又息：寳慶刦案發生的前一天，隔壁的寳華金號。亦被一位僞裝的匪徒，刦去二隻金戒子，維持街市交通與治安的崗警，在二家金號刦案發生時，正是在不到一百公尺的前面執行他的任務。（本報記者劉藻）</p>
<h3>湘醴陵瓷業不景氣</h3>
<p>〔本報景德鎭二十日訊〕湘省醴陵瓷器，爲國內產瓷名區之一，出品僅次於本市所產精瓷。醴瓷質工，在國產中，不算粗劣，它具有百餘年悠長的歷史，戰前窰廠共有七十家，製瓷工人有十四萬人，出品行銷於湘，鄂，豫，川，滇，黔，桂，康諸省，總値達五十餘元。戰時陷敵，窰廠瓷商，損失慘重。復員迄今，陸續復工的窰廠，現有二十餘家，工人有五百餘，約及戰前三分之一弱。祗因規模設備，均欠完善，目前外埠銷塲，只武漢及豫南等地，瓷器自湘運漢，每担需費十餘萬，兼之運輸工具不健全，途中損耗甚大，故今日醴陵瓷業前途，由於銷路之狹弱，資金之短絀，較之戰前情形，誠有一落千丈之勢。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州廿二日訊〕宋子文主席上任以後，似乎給廣東人帶來無限希望，雄設的呼聲，高唱入雲，就中尤以開闢黃埔港一事，自經宋主席公開宣佈「馬上就興工，不需要五年十年的計劃」以後，黃埔築港的工作就一直在進行着，爲華南甚至爲全國所注目的黃埔港，和黃埔未來的遠景也許更多的人在期待着一次具體的認識。</p>
<p>黃埔位於廣州市的東南郊距廣州約有十英里之遙，前臨南海獅子洋背引珠江三河（東西·北江）總匯，枕倚鶴冠山，叢林密佈，迤下爲魚珠平原，一瀉無涯，獅子洋端的黃埔灣，水深千尋，尤爲港口的先天條件，得山水之雄勝，擅江海之通道，無怪乎爲南方第一大港的基點。</p>
<p>黃埔的現況</p>
<p>使人意想不到它只是一片荒漠的郊野，秋日登臨，遠眺萬方，一方面使人憬憧着一個十里洋塲的美夢，一方面也會使人獨對山河而感到無限荒凉寂寞，從廣州到黃埔，有一條黃埔大道，汽軍迅息可達，另外還有一條中山公路直達對望的魚珠市，交通至稱便利（最近粤漢路的黃埔支綫亦已築成通車，不過只運建港器材而不搭客）港口沿岸都築有簡單的海堤，堤上有敵僞時代遺留下來的倉庫數十座，存儲大批鐵路及碼頭的建築器材，準備隨時應用，簡陋的黃埔碼頭，最近頗形熱鬧，運來器材亦不在少，黃埔港附近有一個黃埔墟，名聞世界的革命搖籃黃埔軍校便設在這裏，墟間雀小臟全，應有盡有，市裏熱鬧，將來發展港口以後，這裏將會成爲廣州的「下關」—黃埔與廣州的形勢和下關與南京的關係似乎極爲相似—圩中特別値得介紹的，是名滿華南又香又滑的黃埔炒蛋，今日咤際風雲轉戰南北的黃埔將領，也許對此尙有餘志。</p>
<p>闢港的計畫</p>
<p>屈指算來，足有廿年時光，其間以政局變遷，繼之以敵騎南侵，所以都是「始於言而止於言」，民廿二年廣東曾有治河委員會，到了廿五年秋，改組爲黃埔開埠督辦公署，由曾養甫氏主其事，並聘請美國顧問「古利至」專程來粵察勘，擬就黃埔闢港計畫，　之即開　黃埔港外的第一二沙工程，並著手填　沿港堤岸，建築黃埔大道，數設粤漢路黃埔支綫路基，正當一切都在順利進行，未及兩年，敵寇入侵，一番努力，又成畫餅，敵人盤據廣州時，雖因軍事需要，亦曾增設一部分工程，但是勝利後，卒巳破壞無遺，加之管理無人，所以黃埔一時又變荒島。黃埔闢港也許是一個最理想的目標，所以一大批工程人馬立即來粵，（其中包括中美的港務專家，）擬訂了一個闢港的工程計劃，大致步驟，約分四期進行：</p>
<p>第一期工程</p>
<p>首先完成挖河工程，並疏濬伶仃洋沙底。　完成二·六英里的黃埔大道路面工程及粤漢路黃埔支綫及車塲。　完成烏涌西部和珠江涌南部塡土工作。　建築鈿筋三合土堤岸一千一百五十英尺，驗貨廠兩所長一五〇英尺，寬三百英尺。　安置自來水管，设立地下排水道。　建築黃埔港工程處大厦及員工宿舍。　設小學二所，中學一所，警局二所，消防，淸道，養路所各一，現代市塲一所。總計第一期計劃完成，即可開發黃埔成爲一個初具規模，面積九十三英畝的市而，可容人口約一萬二千至一萬五千人，其巾商店面積將佔二十四萬平方英呎。</p>
<p>第二期工程</p>
<p>繼續向堤岸左右發展約一八〇〇英尺至二千三百英尺，增闢市塲四百英尺，市面人口可增至五萬餘人，設立公用事業，市塲收益吸收居民移住，添設小學六所。小學八所，中學三所，市場四外，設立警察總局，郵局。此期工程，將依據百年一次洪水位（一〇八三五五公尺）由堤邊一〇七。八五的高度，向來逐漸低降，展築堤岸五千呎。以防災潦。</p>
<p>第三期工程</p>
<p>擴展港市，自珠江村以北，西華坊以南，橫沙以西塘口以東地區，悉劃入內，另闢孔壺崗以西，雪峯山以東基地作住宅商店區，開闢石峽，文冲兩地自來水源。加築烏涌南至廣九車站之堤防，繼續完成碼頭一萬六千英尺，設小學廿七所，中學十一所，警局十七所，消防處十所，此期擴展面積已達一千英畝。</p>
<p>未期的工程</p>
<p>此期爲黃埔闢港之完成期，面積已包括整個黃埔區域，自中山大道以北，廣九路起段以南及長洲港以東以迄東江口一帶野郊，全部包攬無遺，總面積廣寬一萬一千英畝，預計人口爲七十五萬至一百萬，黃埔闢港即宣告吿大功吿成。</p>
<p>然而，事實上的困難也使闢港的工程遭遇了不少的困難，舉如經費的不足，人才的缺乏，與及地方上的紛岐意見和阻力，都曾使闢港工程時常感受到一些意外的襲擾，其中最有趣的，也許是闢港權責之爭執。</p>
<p>原來中樞決定黃埔闢港原則之後，初意不外在使黃埔成爲廣州港口以外的一個副港，以輔助廣州的不足，但是地方意見却以爲黃埔闢港早爲國父旣定建設計劃，實有設立與廣州同具價値的港口之必要，前者中央於本年十月，在廣州成立了一個廣州</p>
<p>港務工程局</p>
<p>派陶述曾爲局長，今年的工程費爲五十億，明年將增至五千億元，港務工程局的開設副港初步計劃內容爲：　建築西南大鐵橋，　修建內港碼頭倉庫及河南大板碼頭，　浚深珠江後航綫（以萬噸輪船能自由進出黃埔爲原則）。及第一·二沙及伶仃洋沙底，　在黃埔築碼頭倉庫七十五平方英尺，並修復原有碼頭倉庫，　增設起重機，拖船各五十具，　建造黃埔大船廠，　在黃埔設置一切公用設備，全部工程計劃完成，亦較易舉，但是將使黃埔只能成爲一個　運「大碼頭」，而不能建立一個完美的港市，所以宋主席抵任後不久，曾經就此召集兩局長（珠江水利局長爲楊華日），埀詢詳細情形，以便決定闢港形式及攸分權責。宋氏對後者的計劃，似較贊成，而且已經下令着手施行，大槪黃埔建立一個與廣州可以媲美的港口，已經不會再成問題。</p>
<p>唯一的問題</p>
<p>只有時日的久暫而已。目前，黃埔附近的地價，已經在短短的兩三個月，由每井一萬元左右的價目，一變而爲三百元港幣的數目，而且還有人搶着在買。聞省府亦與四行合组：黃埔港埠興業公司準備在黃埔建立大規模企業，收購地皮，建設工廠碼頭。大家都在想着當萬噸巨輪直駛黃埔堤岸的時候，該是一個怎樣美麗的遠景。（記者梁小中）</p>

<h3>筆市巡禮</h3>
<p>〔本報廿四日訊〕現代文化程度愈高，生活工作的方式愈繁，歐美男女袋內至少有一二支鋼筆，近年來國人用鋼筆的也漸見普遍，已成了各大都市新興事業之一。就記者最近訪問過的一家著名的派克公司，其中就有五花八門了。該公司佈置的方式，光綫的配置，商品的彩色，和營業員的精神，在在使人覺得似乎有點特別。據該公司總經理鈕永集氏相吿，該公司採用科學管理，人事經過相當訓練練，營業主張現代化，社會化。</p>
<p>記者參觀了檢筆部，（這是一個新異的名稱），有多位技士，正在利用着試墨量機，寫字跡機，探視鏡，放大鏡等，將每支鋼筆施行局部檢査。記者問他筆廠想已檢過，何須重檢。他說，筆廠注重產量龐大迅速，不能詳檢，必須在這裏再將每支局部檢査後，方可完全，在一百四十四支華中，保證沒有一支使人不滿意的。</p>
<p>再到診筆部，地位較敞，職員穿着白色號衣，不用手工，藉着電動機器修筆，據稱普通的修理，像關於漏水，淸洗等，均受免費服務，所以這部每年虧蝕很鉅。室中共有小型車床，鋸床，鑽床，錢床，磨光，拋光機等，約二十座，其中有一機，是英國最新式的點鍍機，用强烈電火，將白金點鍍在筆尖頭上。據說鋼筆好壞，全在筆尖，筆尖的靈魂，就是其上的白金，白金點得圓勻，書寫便流利。</p>
<p>刻字部職員，正在操縱着一種美式電刻機在工作，客人在紙上隨便簽的名字，可以在此機上縮小五倍，刻出眞跡。去年一年中，政府機關，和工商團體去該公司購筆刻字，在節上分作贈品的，有二十多個單位。</p>
<p>函購部辦理答詢價目裝發郵件的業務，室內打字聲音不絕，桌上包裹車疊。記者發現一包，是寄往南洋去的，很爲驚異，後來才知道南洋人本來可以到菲列賓購筆，但如我們忠實服務，他們寗願到更遠的地方來購買。</p>
<p>以後問他近幾年鋼筆的進化史，他說，　筆本來是用皮管的，但因生垢易腐，一九二二年美國派克筆公司發明眞空管，除淸潔外，尙可看到墨量，一九四一年更造51型筆，內裝特稱節水鈕，不可漏水，便爲鋼筆的大成。記者問：原子筆發明後，鋼筆會否淘汰？他說，不能，因爲原子筆不能包括鋼筆尖粗細的妙能，但原子筆對於複寫，登記，旅行，却也有特別的便利。</p>
<p>市面上筆牌衆多，美不勝收，使購筆者莫知所從，究竟應購何筆方妥？他答，鋼筆必須不漏水，必須筆尖流利，方可購買，有四家公司所出的筆，就是派克，愛弗釋，　脫門，犀飛利，都裝進特種不漏水機鈕，筆尖也精微磨光，介乎以上二個條件。又問他關於護筆的方法。他說，只要每星期把筆在冷水內吸放一二，可以淸洗內部，免生百病。</p>

<h3>台糖二萬五千噸輸往日本　已興盟總簽訂合同　台灣碼頭交貨每噸美金二百元　由盟軍派輸裝載四月底可裝完</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台糖公司協理宋以信氏，此次爲接洽台糖輸日事宜，於十二日自滬直飛東京，業於昨日下午三時許，公畢乘機返滬。承語記者：日本對外貿易，自去年八月中旬開放後，各方面均已作充分之準備。故國外貿易代表抵達東京時，即能迅速進行接洽貿易事宜。目前日本已設置貿易廳，專事管理接洽日本對外貿易事宜。各國貿為代表抵日後，可先與日貿易廳洽談貿易進行手續條件，經盟軍經濟科學部之國外貿易組核准後，即可開始辦理。惟盟軍爲調劑日本國內外貿易盈　計，一種輸出物資，其國內及輸出之價格，未盡相等。</p>
<p>第一批輸日台糖之談判，早於去年三月間開始。當時因日本貿易廳尙未設立，故係與盟軍主管當局直接洽談。第一批輸日合糖，洽定總額爲二萬五千噸，每噸在台灣之交貨價，當時爲美金三百三十五元。後以種種關係，盟軍未及派船往合運載。加以糖價日跌，迭經交涉接洽，決定成交價每噸在台灣之交貨價，爲美金二百元。糖款由盟軍自救濟日本復興之款項內撥出，故係現款交易。簽訂合同時，國輪噸位尙未復原，洽定爲在台灣碼頭交貨，故屆時將由盟軍派輪來台裝載。大致在本年四月底以前，可以全部装完。自日貿易局成立後，今後合糖輸日，須與該廳接洽。而該應對外貿易，係以易貨爲原則，該廳本身，並無現款輸入外貨。故第二批台糖之轍日事宜，尙待接洽。</p>
<p>又此次留日時，朝鮮事務局亦派員來日洽談輸入台糖事宜。緣朝鮮原向古巴所訂購之食糖，因受古巴糖工罷工影響，供應中斷堪虞。故擬輸入台糖一二萬噸，以資調劑。惟朝鮮對外易貨，亦以易貨爲主。而朝鮮轍出物資，類多非我國所必需者。故我國仍望以現款交易爲原則，現亦正待接洽中。</p>
<h3>食米內地回漲　粳秈售價上升</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧儿千一百餘石，天氣嚴寒，雪花紛飛，內地回漲，人心激昻。粳秈米均見猛　五六七萬元不一，白元亦然跟漲三五萬元，陰元亦升二三萬元。麵粉消化活絡，繼續飛升二萬餘元，午時廠方以五十八萬元大量拋售，略見回軟。麩皮鄕銷轉動，頓形俏利，猛加二萬元。</p>
<p>豆餅客帮續辦，廠方以原料昻貴，售心頗堅，步砌二萬餘元，收盤見淡。黃豆客銷蜂起，求渦於供，逐步高翔，再漲五六萬元。　豆貨主堅挺，狂漲七八萬元。</p>
<p>赤豆散戶收吸，客帮問津亦殷，突漲五六萬元。蠶豆另化亦　，回漲四五萬元。豇豆隨各物上漲三五萬元，紅糧存貨不多，步升二三萬元。</p>
<p>苞米北洋去化仍懈，生仁廣方添辦，本街競購，續漲十餘萬元。芝蔴油廠續吸，本街有動，天津亦有成交，步步上升，再加十萬元。</p>
<p>油市早市疾升，午時回跌，結果各油軋漲十餘萬元。</p>
<p>據麵粉市塲負責人談稱：當局欲求徹底壓平粉價，必須請糧食部改善核准轉口辦法，與本市常局合作，始可收效。因過去麵粉出口，槪由商人直接向糧食部申請發給轉口許可證後，即向市塲或產區高價搜購，影響市價甚巨。渠意請糧食部此後審核轉口粉時，最好每月直接規定廠商轉口數額及價格，再與本市有關當局取得聯繫，以免核發數量過多，奸商活動等，以刺激粉價之弊害云。</p>
<h3>內匯率再調整</h3>
<p>國家行局庫內匯率頃再調整如次：厦門每千元一二○元（原一五〇元），泉州一二〇元（原一五〇元），福州一〇〇元（原一五〇元），廣州九〇元（原一二〇元），汕頭一四〇元（原一六〇元），海口一四〇元（原一六〇元），長沙七〇元（原一〇〇元），衡陽七○元（原一〇○元），徐州一二元（原一五元），屯溪五〇元（原六〇元），蚌埠一二元（一五元），歙縣五〇元（原六〇元），武漢五〇元（原七〇元），贛州六〇元（原五〇元），嘉興四元（原三元），重慶三元（原八元），成都三元（原八元）其他各地不變。</p>
<h3>開放工貨問題　四聯總處研究中</h3>
<p>處理自備外匯貨品審議委員會，昨日下午舉行第十九次會議，討論西藥染料複議及配售手續等問題，決議如下：　原定進口商申請配售原進口貨品，須經過有關同業公會蹬明，現爲簡化手續，便利廠商起見，改爲殷實廠商證明，即可申請配售。　染料　種配售加成數，業經上次會議決定，惟因進口商提出異議，茲經與廠商礎商，業已取得一致，定下週內公吿施行。至西藥加成數，一部份已吿議定，惟以種類繁多，定下週二繼續討論。</p>
<p>廢曆年前恐難恢復</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕恢復工業貸款，舊年前已無希望，政府爲解救目前工業界困難，正另諜補救辦法，華北方面已決定由政府收購工業成品，以代替工貸，至此項辦法是否適用於東南及京·滬一帶，目前尙在考慮，外傳舊曆年前將舉辦一種臨時性緊急貸款說，四聯總處人士廿四日已予否認，謂此事決不可能。</p>

<h3>經營證券事業　宜有高尚作風</h3>
<p>近日市上酒樓茶店，紛設證劵號，證交當局昨函致經紀公會，略謂：「査證劵交易所爲金融事業之一環，各經紀人，自應重視本身立塲，設　獨立之營業所，專一經營。設與黑市金號或地下錢莊等非法機構，混雜營業，難免受累。其附設於舞塲酒店飯店茶室者，地點旣屬嘈雜，環境亦非所宜，至於以咖啡飯劵等爲號召，藉　招徠，一般印象尤不見隹。此項營業作風，似有立加振刷一之必要，事關全體經紀人之高尙地位，相應函連，即希査照分知，隨時注意爲荷」云云。</p>
<h3>印禁止棉花輸出　對我易棉無影響</h3>
<p>關於印度禁止棉花輸出事，昨據紡織品外銷委員會負責人解釋稱：印度自昨“起禁止棉花輸出者，僅係佛敎區之範圍，如孟買等地，而其他如回敎區等等城市之棉花，仍可照常輸出。我國自與印度洽定以紗布易棉後，迄　前止，已達十萬包，該批成交之十萬包中，雖有一部份在佛敎區域內，但仍可照常輸出，毫無影響。此後該會通知我國各紗布商，可繼續向其他回敎區等地與印商治易棉事，故依實際情形而論，印度孟買等地禁止印棉出口，與我國此紗布易印棉事並無影響。又該會爲充實我國棉花來源，近又分別向南洋菲洲等地洽購外棉，惟在價格方面尙未決定云。</p>
<h3>解救華北工商業危機　政府決採收購方式　劉攻芸已於昨晨返滬</h3>
<p>冀平津工廠及出口物資問題，急待解決。茲經請願各代表與主管機關多方商談，主管機關等，均懇切表示，對以上問題，力謀解決。至於解決途徑，決採取收購方式。詳細辦法，正在擬訂中。又中央銀行劉副總裁攻芸，前（廿二）日爲解決華北金融，及外銷物資問題，特代表張總裁赴京，劉氏已於昨（廿四）日晨返滬。據悉：此行極爲圓滿，經與有關各部會及請願團商談，對以上兩問題，獲得具體決定：　金融方面，決遵照蔣主席之指示，農曆年關內，工貸暫不開放，但工廠因年關絕對需要之資金，決以收購方式，於年關內酌予收購其成品。　外銷物資，可收購一部份。至收購計劃，已在上海方面着手擬定，劉氏於午間即向張總裁報吿此行經過，並硏討收購辦法。</p>
<p>中央銀行總裁張嘉璈於昨晨召集剛由京返滬之副總裁劉攻芸及該行業務局局長沈熙瑞，在總裁室商談恢復工業貸款問題甚久。</p>
<h3>華股賡續上漲　小型更見俏利</h3>
<p>華股昨賡續上漲，但永紗逢高有金融帮出籠，籌碼較爲鬆動，雖漲而中途頗費掙扎。小型股中華豐旣得大量買戶，復有增資消息，與中法同吿漲停。統益景福亦見俏利。</p>
<p>晨開以工貸有轉機，永紗爲七六〇元及七八五元，華豐且達漲停。勤興閘北中法亦吿漲停，永紗升至七七〇元及七九五元，一度退爲七五三元及七八二元，旋又升爲七六〇元及七九〇元。塲外息價又開三角三及三角七分半，以　多而尙有回風。十一時後，洋股突吿俏利，先漲到七八五元及八〇五元新高價。繼而賣至七五八元及七八六元收市。結果較前收即交股華豐中法漲停，勤興閘北漲停後後有回，前者升一成，後者好　成。景福新華升一成，美亞火柴統益五和漲半成，餘均微升。遞交股華豐漲停，勤　興升成半，景福漲半成，餘亦　升。塲外各未上市股票，文化銀行公用均見趨秀，餘尙平定。</p>
<h3>本客各帮進意濃厚　棉紗布人轉堅　四二支藍鳳細紗破六千萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開人心尙堅，各紗高盤喊開，旋以散戶獲利吐售，市氣漸吿回平，不久客帮進意仍濃，檯面帮哄抬甚勁。四十二支藍鳳細紗冲出六千萬關，曾高至六千一百萬元，迨至收時，因週六關係，浮多乘高脫手。最後回至五千九百七十萬元爲收價，卒較上日續漲八十萬元。卅二支各級細紗，因複製商扒吸，軋升二百五十萬至三百餘萬。其他各支粗細紗，亦一致步高三四十萬至一百五六十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開喊價仍堅，嗣因山西及福建等帮進吸嗶嘰甚多，借貨拋空者亦有抵補，市勢上展。詎至十時許，因廠家員工之年賞需款，存貨拋出頗衆，並聞工貸無恢復希望，業中頭寸尙緊，臨收賣氣轉濃。故最後十二磅各檔細布，行情比上日呈漲跌互見之勢，惟　嘰及漂布獨俏，其餘各布平穩。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共售一八六二〇疋，申購單四六五張，內除廠商一〇張，購布四百疋外，餘均屬布號所購。</p>
<p>省市銀行興行莊間　不得訂立通匯契約</p>
<p>據悉：財政部鑒於各省市地方與商業行莊，訂定通匯契約，代解匯款，難免不發生存放情事，顯與最近修正公佈之加强金融業務管制辦法第三條乙項：「省市銀行存款同業款項除當地無中央銀行者得存放於其他國家行局庫外，應一律存放當地中央銀行，不得以任何方式以資金存放其他國家行局庫或轉放商業行莊」之規定不合，特再明文規定，嗣後省市銀行不得與商業行莊訂應立通匯契約，其已訂立者，應即日清洁，解除契約具報。</p>

<p>現棉　堅</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况轉佳，同業銀根稍寬，交易活絡，小型紗廠略有吸胃，更以紗布由疲轉俏，故人心趨堅，散戶抵　，價格較上日好起五萬至十萬，成交五百包左右。各檔做開棧交價漢細四九六萬至五一二萬六千，又漢細改良種棉五三七萬三千，山東脫力司五八七萬，火機四六三萬，周浦籽花一一九萬至一二〇萬。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據有關方面悉：經濟部昨有訓令致紗管會主任委員袁良，謂該會任務艱鉅，一切事務必須穩愼辦理。並指示今後各種規章，均應呈部核定後，始可實施。所有公文應遵行政系統先行呈部，不得越級呈請。荐任級以上人員，均應呈　由部核派，委雇人員亦應報部核准，並限制除穗·漢·津·三地已設立辦事處外，其他地區，非經經濟部核准，不得增設云。</p>
<h3>呢羢交易轉寂</h3>
<p>昨週六，呢絨零銷生意，因險　年　將到，實　　　，以致均見淸淡。其　批原疋整箱交易，亦莫不因此而轉寂。大體上齊多止漲而　平穩。回顧呢絨商號興，售出補進之宗旨，荀未銷出，皆不願補進。</p>
<h3>肥皂火柴活躍</h3>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，因貨主扳持，兼以週末期票拆息關係，行情趨堅，而用現鈔進出者，則較收價微低。固本皂現鈔價一百七十四萬元有成交，午後交易活躍，價做高至一百七十七萬五千元，比上日續漲五萬元，箭刀皂漲四萬，爲一百七十四萬元。黃祥茂派貨消息沉寂，實銷甚健，上升五萬五千元。其餘光華美麗等皂，亦均步升二，三，四萬元不一。</p>
<p>火柴交易亦形活躍，美麗鳳凰兩牌均上展二十萬，同爲九百二十萬元。寗波南京玫瑰老虎等　牌，亦升五萬至十萬元。火油市勢平定。</p>
<h3>捲烟買多轉堅</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，晨開人心尙佳，買戶仍形活動，兼以週末關係，兩天期票，散戶拉提頗勁，價乃哄抬上揚。午收時突有利賣之傳言，銀根仍緊，一般浮多獲利趁高出籠，塲外行情喊低。十支大英三千三百五十萬元有賣出，其餘亦都比掛牌價小。</p>
<p>午後市勢轉堅，趁低吸收者甚夥，同業交易亦旺。迨至最後，十支大英烟每箱漲至三千四百三十萬元，比上日續漲一百卅五萬，老刀亦高九十萬，爲二千七百七十五萬元。其餘中外各條烟，亦均步升自五百元至四五千元不等。</p>
<p>又五十支裝聽烟，因漢口天津方面均有來貨，市情欲振乏力。茄力克廿二一萬五六千元有人肯賣，結果軋小五千元，三五牌等價亦帶小。</p>
<h3>收購外銷物資　出口商請注意收購價格</h3>
<p>外銷物資收購辦法公佈後，本市出口商對此頗爲注意。據出口鉅子稱，該辦法實行後，國外市塲可得拓展，但中信局收購後之銷售事宜，應委託出口商辦理，以維持出口商業務，俾收外錯之効·又稱政府對收購價格之家議，應依據下列兩原則：　在產地收購價格，應先估計共生產成本，再根據其生產者之生活費用及生產原料，作爲產地收購價格。　集中地收購價格，應加上運費，改裝精裝等費用，及運輸商之合法利潤，俾可順利收購，否則持貸者恐不願賣出云。</p>

<h3>工業原料飛</h3>
<p>工業原料市况，以來源不繼，各方採納甚暢，致存底日薄，開價飛騰。月牌燒碱每桶狂漲三百萬，爲五千四百萬元，純碱每袋亦漲至六百萬兀，軋升二十萬。美貨燒碱軋漲三百五十萬元，每桶五千二百五十萬兀，白臘每擔軋升三十萬，爲六百三十萬元。此外美貨N松香小蘇打保險粉黃白凡士林等，亦均上升甚鉅。</p>
<h3>苧蔴產地價昂</h3>
<p>苧蔴市面，因產地貨少開價頻漲，致來源亦稀，而實銷甚暢，存底日减，做價飛俏。昨公會掛牌，白蔴每担高至四十四五萬元，門售四十八萬，杭蔴二十二萬元，門售廿六萬元，上升一二成之譜。靑黃二蔴無貨應市。</p>
<h3>茶葉市氣堅定</h3>
<p>連日脫手順利之內銷茶，昨因本街與客帮之買氣依然濃郁，致過程　續不衰。價格方面，均在堅檔做開。至於洋莊茶市，情勢岑靜如故，出口商之胃納猶屬狹窄，但市氣則以執主心思仍趨佳境，遂亦頻頻　堅。</p>

<h3>賠償與救濟</h3>
<p>一月十八日，加利福尼亞輪運到首批美國救濟麵粉十九萬包；一月二十二日，海康輪運到首批日本賠償機器四百五十三件，前者是『患難之交」的美國友人對我們，質上的援助，後者是『戰爭禍首』日本軍閥爲其侵略罪行所付出的代價。</p>
<p>救濟物資的意義，誠如美總領事卡勃脫在歡迎典禮中所說：〔是項糧食係美國人民贈給目前暫時受苦之中國人民，並可視作美國願意繼續救濟與恢復戰後秩序之明證。」這一種誠摯的友愛，將使中國人民永矢勿忘。同時，我們堅決的相信，祗要我們刻苦奮鬥，努力不懈、所謂「自助者人助之」，國外援助一定會繼續不斷的源源而來，幫助我們渡過今日艱難困苦的局面。</p>
<p>賠償機器的獲得是我們經過了八年抗戰，犧牲了無數軍民的生命財產所換來，因此之故，我們愈感覺到這批物資的彌足珍貴。如何勿使浪費，以求物盡其利：如何善爲運用，從事復興建國，這是今後接收機關　重大任務，也是全國人民的殷切期望所寄。</p>

<h3>論通俗文學</h3>
<p>— 仲玉</p>
<p>多年之前，我曾經寫過許多考證或是研究通俗文學的文章，當時自以為通俗文學是為大衆所好的文學，所以提倡通俗文學是一件非常有意義的事，况且人棄我取，在這種荒　裏又是大可有所收穫的。</p>
<p>伹是後來忽然一想，單是考證和研兜，除了對於文學史作者的確有所貢獻外，對於通俗文學本身，却有些什麽用處？單是去考據元明戲曲的作者，或是探溯明清小說的來源，這對於大衆會有什麼影響嗎？况且所謂通俗文學，這裏祗專指宋元以來的話本，戲曲，彈詞之類——的本身，是否有提倡的價值，是否希望它依舊發展下去？這種種，恐怕一般通俗文學的研究者都沒有計及。實在倒是一個應該先決的問题。</p>
<p>吾以為一般通俗文學研究者的錯誤，就是「薄今厚古」，徒然研究而沒有顧到創作。因為「薄今厚古」，所以他們——我也在内——對於現代社會那些最流行最受大衆歡迎的通俗讀物，却視若無視，而對於像元代刻本「全相五種評話」之類却視如拱璧。照我看來，那些元刻本的「全相五種評話」之類，實在就是元朝的連環圖畫，那種似通非通的文字，迷信狂妄的思想，簡直還遠不如現時流行的有些好的連環圖畫。其他戲曲，彈詞之類，也無不如此。有什麽值得研究呢？如果值得研究，那麼現時的連環圖畫，過了數百年而偶存孤本的時候，研究者可也將視為「全相五種評話」第二，而也視之如拱璧嗎？那麼我們爲什麽不現在就珍視它，而讓它等到數百年後呢？這樣一說穿便覺我們用全力去研究那古時同樣的東西，不免有些好笑。至於說創作不是我主張一定要提倡，我的意思以為一樣事情旣認為值得研究，便同時須去應用，我們旣認為舊的通俗文學有研究的價值，那麼我們便應創造新的通俗文學，使它發展而有用，否則徒研究而不創作，這研究所費的辛勤，便是徒擲虛牝。</p>
<p>所以，我现在已無心於再作通俗文學的研究，而頗有意於通俗文舉的創作。因為我看了那些世界名著譯本和名家創作的銷路，如何也趕不上那些標貼萬小說的銷路，而且前者一過了時竟可沒有人再顧問，而後者却在年年不斷的銷下去，可見在敎育沒有普及，知識水準沒有提高的中國，儘有合於衛生，而又富於滋養的新式精神糧食，總因不合口胃而吞不進去，暂時還是粥飯蔬菜，仍合於大衆的脾胃，而值得改良提倡。臀如說：把普式庚的「杜勃洛失司基」改寫成為中國武俠小說的式樣，衹要不將作者原意歪曲，那不見得銷路會不及「江湖奇俠傳」。巴金的「家」是銷路最好的一本書，有人説它的作風受「紅搂夢」的影響。這是說新創作而受着通俗小說的影響的，反能增多它的讀者。那麼我們為什麼不索性向着創作通俗小說之路直走呢？</p>
<p>但是我所主張的創作通俗文學，不是舊瓶裝新酒，而是用竹筷子來吃大菜，是暫時的，而不是永久的。</p>
<h3>繁榮之道</h3>
<p>— 紅</p>
<p>一個橫斷大陸的旅行家在游程中迷失路途，到了奧石克山區的冷落部份。這時天色已晚，幸福望見前面有一所孤獨的茅舍，不致錯過宿頭。旅行家連忙跑去打門，出來應聲的是一個農夫，答應他在家中留宿一宿。</p>
<p>吃罷晚飯，旅行家想總要和主人寒暄敷和一會。「這種地方要維持一個農村的開支，看來是很吃力的吧？」他說。「請敎你是怎樣支持的？」</p>
<p>主人捋捋鬍子，指着在桌子一端默默地吃飯的長工說：「看見這在桌邊吃飯的人嗎？不錯，他為我做工，但是我付不出工錢。因此兩年之後，田地全歸他名下了。於是我為他做工，以至把田地「做」轉來。我們這樣交換做地生。已有二十二年歷史，因此事業發達，我們還想找一個同道呢。」</p>
<h3>巴黎人的顧問</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>無綫　　傳出一個簡單報告，有一架路過巴黎的飛機在近郊失事。巴黎人聽到了這個消息，趕快要去打聽失事飛機的下落。可是他們在心慌意亂中用不到去翻電話簿，只要喊SVP聽電話，對方就詳細告訴了你關於失事飛機的情形。</p>
<p>斯福逝世之後，法國報界拼命到參考箱中去找關於繼承者杜魯門的材料，可憐所得極少。，不够應用。有人說，何不去找SVP呢，一個電話打過去，參考材料源源供給出來。</p>
<p>SVP究竟是什麽組織呢？原來是利用電話，為巴黎的二千五百萬人服務的機構。SVP是一句法文的縮寫，原為S’il　Vous　Plait，意思是，「如其你便利的話」，我想可以意譯成「德音有便」，因為SVP是電話服務社，而我們早年的電話，是被稱作德律風的。「德音」在此地便帶着兩重含義了。SVP每天收到問詢的電話數以千計，大都在幾分鐘內可把答案告訴對方。它的服務範圍至廣，差不多可以算作一部活的世界年鑑。</p>
<p>法國有一小孩患病極重，已頻絕境。醫生說，唯一的救星要用配尼西林。母親問過好幾家藥房，都回說没有。後來問到一家，他們也沒有，但介紹她去轉問SVP，果然獲得滿意的答裏，他們為她查出了有配尼西林存货的一家藥房，並用急足去買了來送到府上。</p>
<p>巴黎有一個女主人請客，來賓都到齊了，還缺一位，寫了一紙便條來，說為了要事　身，不能赴宴。客人面面相觑，不敢坐下，因為連主人在內，數數一共是十三人，太不祥的敷目！主人急得沒有辦法，臨時再去邀請別的親友，有失禮貌而且未必一定能來。如何辦呢，忽然有人想到了SVP，電話中說明原委之後，不失所望，半小時內來了一位衣冠楚楚的代表，湊成十四之數。</p>
<p>有一個星卜家，問SVP關於共產黨成立日期。要他們供給確切的年月日時，以便推算共產黨的命運。他在電話裏這樣講，「有一位著名政治家等着我的推算作參考呢」。這種查詢竟然沒有耽擱，便獲得了答覆。</p>
<p>向SVP查詢的，大都是非常重要的問題，因此他們的工作也很吃重。SVP的主顧是採基本訂戶制，每月收費自一百二十五法郎至一千八百法郎（約合美金一元到十五元），視電話次數及服務繁複與否而定取費的多寡。當大戰結束時，雷密登打字機公司收到一批必須修理了才好應用的軍用打字機，共有幾千架，如其不加漆過，內部整修過，就無法出售或出租，修理廠認為至少要幾個月才可以修好，SVP給雷密頓找到一家修理廠，數星期中便把機器修理完竣。</p>
<p>SVP創辦於一九三五年，創辦人喬治，孟台爾，是法國政府的交通部長，後被納粹槍殺。孟台爾在創始時即努力從事，電話費日有增加，郵務部收容了二百四十九個失業職員，戰時及戰後的法國需要SVP的助力更大，職員已五倍於創辦時期，現在每天進出的電話在一萬只以上。</p>
<p>SVP現在的主持者是德克海姆，他們有一條服務口號是「簡化巴黎人的生活」。德克海姆還有一椿貢獻值得一提：他在戰時看見一個送到醫院去的病人，因為其時機動車缺乏，病人躺在木板上，用孩車運人帶板　送醫院。德克海姆見了心有不忍，想出了一種和上海三輪車相似的載客脚踏車，病人躺在其中，旣可避風，坐墊也是儘可能地舒適，因此改輕了許多嚴重的病症，救獲了不少生命。</p>
<h3>宗族獎學金</h3>
<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>學期即將結束，熱心敎育人士，都在發動募集獎學金，鼓動清寒子弟向學，培植國家人才，其意義至為深長，所以我們應當本「有力出力，有錢出錢」的原則，在自已的本能上去努力，務使每一個清寒學子，都有就學機會。</p>
<p>我國每一宗敎，都有一個祠堂，每年春秋二季，也例必祭祀，這原是「慎終追遠」的意思，筆者並不反對。但是這春秋二祭，在錠箔之外，還有祭榮，凡屬與祭的，幷可大嚼一頓，少的兩三桌，多至十敷桌，每次祭祀的化費，也動輒在數百萬元或至數千萬元之鉅。以祖宗血汗所積的產業，來供子孫的大嚼，似乎太不值得。筆者認為子孫的祭祀祖宗，原是應當的，但是默察子孫的到祠堂去祭祖，竟有許多幷不是「為祭祖而祭祖」，而是「為吃而祭祖」了。所以筆者建議，大可把這「祭餘」取消，移作宗族獎學金。大凡一個宗族裏，有富的也就有窮的，有心向學而無力讀書的，當然不在少數，倘然每一個宗族都能照此辦理，那末清寒子弟的失學機會，一定可以减少許多；如果富有者再捐些出來，這個嚴重的失學問题，也就可以解決過半了。與其每年二次隆重地舉行這虛無縹緲的祭祀儀式，又何不為宗族造就人才呢？</p>
<h3>信用</h3>
<p>— 允恭</p>
<p>語云；「人無信不立」。事實上差不多一筆有關銀錢出入的交易，都與信用不可分離。有時候，我們先付錢給人家，然移得到我們所須要的服務或物品。有時候我們先取得服務或物品後，然後以相當酬報給對方。例如上戲院看戲，乘火車購票等，係屬於前者，又如乘黃包車，或赴餐館進餐則係屬於後者，大抵權衡雙方信用，地位較高的一方，可以先得到代價或免費的享用。我常常懷疑一個衣衫襤褸的人，上一家出名昂貴的大酒家去進食，堂倌們是否會先向他收取一定金額後，才允許他點菜！</p>
<p>自然，品定一個人信用的高下，是一種極不容易的事，往往儀表不凡的人，也許竟會鬧出坍台的笑話來。據一位在舞廳中供職的會計告訴我，有一次一個衣冠整齊的紳土，乘散塲時，宽想揩油茶資，溜之大吉，後為小郎們抓住，逼着他脫下一雙皮鞋來，讓他乘車回去將茶資取來後，才准許他贖回。說來這似乎是一件不近人情的事實。</p>
<p>我們當然希望每一個人，甚至每一個國家，都能維持良好的信用，說一是一，說二是二。如果眞能做到古人所說的「畫地為牢，不敢逾越」的一天，國與國之間，惟信義是尙，那末縱有原子彈，也無所施其技了。</p>
<h3>廣告</h3>
<p>— 諤</p>
<p>「侍者，」火冒的餐客說，「這是爲什麽？我出的是同樣的代價，爲什麽今天這塊鷄只及昨天的一半？」</p>
<p>「唔，先生，」侍者回答。「昨天你坐得是那一桌？」</p>
<p>「在靠窗的一面。」</p>
<p>「先生，那就對了。我們總是送給靠窗的吃客一盆較大的鷄。這是最好的廣告呀。」</p>
<h3>夫婦之道</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>幾年前，好萊塢在拍攝一張武俠片的時候，男主角必須從堡壘的牆上，跳過一道鴻溝，立到石級上。那太危瞼了，所以，好萊塢的测量家被喚來測量了。「不行！」他詳細地測量和計算後對導演說。他以為誰若要跳，一定會跌傷的。</p>
<p>那導演是個粗魯暴躁的人，他說：「膽小鬼，怕什麼，我自己來跳！」</p>
<p>於是，他拉了繩，從堡壘的牆上，躍過鴻溝，放手跳了。結果，他跌在地上，背膀和雙腿都受了傷，醫院中住了六個月。</p>
<p>根據這個軼事，現在，我自己假使對太太的燒飯，管孩子……等等家務之事有所指摘的時候，妻決不和我爭論，就只幽默地說：「你也要拉繩自己跳嗎？」立刻使我啞口無言了。若是她要責我賺錢太少，不會囤積投機，不會做股票金條，那麼，我也不去同她爭吵，僅只笑笑地說：「你想目己跳嗎？」——老實說，短短的一句笑話，此相幫要有效力得多呢。</p>
<h3>攝影機捉賊</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>新近，美國加州一對优麗在酒排間內慶祝他們的結婚週年紀念，邀請一個在塲的士兵共飲。當他接受的時候，有一個專在酒排間內替人拍照的攝影師便將這歡樂的一幕攝入了鏡頭。那兵士坐了不久，謝過男女主人，就起身告辭了。</p>
<p>過後，攝影師將他的照片送了上來，女主人隨意的瞥了一眼就伸手想取錢付值，但是，她的錢包失竊了。將照片冲洗放大了之後，赫然的顯露出偷錢者正是那個做客的兵土。</p>
<p>像這類的事情時常發生，足以證明攝影機無疑的常會變成第一流的大偵探。在訓練有素的衛法者的手中，將罪犯繩之以法，鏡頭如同手槍一樣的有效，因為呈上法庭的證據沒有此照片更强而有力的了。和人證不同，攝影機清晰的記得每一個細節。並且它常看到肉眼所忽略的東西。</p>
<p>當中西城的警察尋覓一塲神秘的爆炸案的時候，他們有理由的懷疑到一個住在三十哩外的一個鎮中的工人。但是，他們却找不到歸罪於他的證據。</p>
<p>不過，在調查的時期終於發現了一段木頭，這段木頭上有一層模糊的，看上去像似報紙的印跡。警察知道爆炸力常使一樣東西印到毋一樣東西上面，便決定將木頭上的印跡用不透紅光的攝影機拍攝出來。</p>
<p>在放大的照片之中，這段印跡清晰可讀，它被證實是那個工人的居地在爆炸前十二小時所出版的一張報紙上所刊載的一篇故事的一部份。警察把他們的證據放在孃疑犯的面前，他祇好俯首認罪了。</p>
<p>雖然攝影機時常使歹徒伏法，但是，它也保護無辜者。有一個女子，被控謀殺她的丈夫。她辯白她的丈夫的被殺是意外的不幸。她說；他那天喝醉了酒回家，她在草地上遇到了他，他便拔出手槍恫嚇她，於是兩人發生爭奪，不幸手槍走火，將他射死了</p>
<p>檢察官對這種辯護嘲笑，斷言她在長廊裏等着她丈夫，當他走過草地時，便隔着一道屏門開槍射死了他。</p>
<p>被告的情形似將絕望，這時她的律師呈給陪審團一小包照片。它们都是放射過的子弹的照片，其中僅有一張照片中的子彈上沒有交又的痕跡。這顆子弹便是從被告的丈夫的屍體中取出來的。另外幾張照片中的子彈都是穿過屏門射入一道橡木門的——雖然橡木門的抵抗力比人體還大，可是依然消滅不了子彈上所带的穿越屏門的痕跡。</p>
<p>這些照片證實了那女子的無辜——因為射死她的丈夫的那顆子彈不可能曾經穿越過屏門。</p>
<p>拍電影的攝影在無數的案件中也是主要的證人，它所給的證據與普通的攝影機一樣的有効，並且常是更壯觀。例如，在一九四二年，當麻省的總檢察官要控訴波斯頓的設賭行騙者的證據的時候，他便給他的調查員一批電影機，攝影將它們架在歹徒的大本營的進口處附近。當案子開審的時候，法庭中張起銀幕，檢察官把所攝的「電影」放映出來，每天進出匪窟的歹徒們的尊容頓時都躍起「幕」上。於是，全部三十三個騙子都定了罪。</p>
<h3>一笑集</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>有一女子在她丈夫死後不多時候便和她丈夫的哥哥結了婚，鄰居頗多非議。可是她不忘舊情，在客室中褂了一張她前夫的肖像，鄰居們始覺稍慰，可是有一天他們聽到下面的一段對話：</p>
<p>一個來客看着肖像問女主人道：「敢問那相貌堂堂的人是誰？」再醮婦答道：「嗄，他嗎，他是我的小叔，是不久之前才去世的。」</p>
<p>一個暴發戶決心要把世界上一切最好的東西給他的子女享受。他把女兒送到大學裏去念書。可是他的女兒成績低劣，跟不上同班刖的學生，被命退學。父親問她原因何在時，她坦率自陳，說是天資不够，刖的學生能做的功課牠做不來。暴發戶把手一揚，說道：「這個容易，我去給你買一個天資便了。」</p>
<p>於某次結婚典禮中，一位新郎的朋友決心去研究來賓之中對於彼此間的客套語是否眞的洗耳恭聽。他對走過他身旁的每位客人說了一句；「我的祖父今天死了。」</p>
<p>來賓對於這句話的反應如下：「啊，好極了！」「謝謝你！」「你說得眞有趣！」沒有一人眞的知道他說的是什麼，新郎更是糊塗，他笑容滿臉地答道：「老兄也該採取同樣步驟了！」</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第九章　洩漏機密（五二）</p>
<p>綺紈催了好幾次，見渚齋都沒結果，以為渚齋對於置　　　是外行的，便另託別人，不到幾天工夫，便看定粉坊琉璃街一所樓房，也不通知渚齋，直等到過款寫字騰房都辦好了，才告訴渚齋。渚齋一聽綺紈已把房子買好了，一時呆住，怔了半天，說不出話來。綺紈見他神奇，似乎不大贊成，笑道：「渚，你如何不明白我的意思，我是好而子的，我們買了房子再舉行結婚，不是很體面嗎？你主張旅行結婚，我認為太草率了，你旣和你太太離了婚，你再結婚，法律上一點不違背，我們又何以這樣委委屈屈。再說結婚是人生大事，一生也只有一次，不能不風光，至一切費用，在我預算，我的能力，可能全部負担，不用你分心。我買這所房子，也有原因，現在我所住房子，是父親遺留的，歸我居住，沒人說話，但我終認我還有哥哥和弟弟，他們也得平均分配，現在我有能力，能買得起房子，當然要買一所，把這一所房子，勝出給我弟弟，才是合理。我所買的房子，是座舊式樓房，擬是美術家，富於美術天才，必能給我幫忙，經你一改造，一定很美觀。所用工款，可不必計較，但求盡美盡善。」渚齋見綺紈已安妥房子，木已成舟，阻止也無益，又見她興致勃勃，只好服從她的意思，笑道：「你祗說呌我改造，房子是什麽樣子，我還不知道呢。」綺紈道：「房子是舊式的，呌我說也說不清，我現在就和你去看一看。」說後，披上大衣，和渚齋到粉坊琉璃街，渚齋一看那座房子，門面還好，只是太舊些，前後相了一回，問道：「你的意思，打算如何計劃？」綺紈道：「我是聽候美術家支配呀！」渚齋菹：「我看這一道埀花門，先要除掉，牠不但佔地方，而且不美觀。」綺紈點點頭道：「我也是這種看法。」渚齋道：「埀花門一去掉，院子就顯得大了，可以多種些花木，正面樓房，樱上五間，一間作卧室，爾間客房，一間書房，一間浴室，樓下五間，三間大客廳，二間做餐室，也自够用，剩下東西廂六間，留着堆置東西，和底下使人住所，也足够分配」。</p>

<h3>Chairman Convened Military Meeting, Conference on Pacification of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui Extended, National Army in Western Liaoning Steadfastly Defending Xinlitun</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a military meeting at his official residence at 10:00 AM on the 24th, attended by Qin Decun, Deputy Minister of National Defense acting as Minister, Liu Fei, Deputy Minister, Lin Wei, Deputy Chief of Staff, and Fang Tian, among others. It is reported that the meeting decided to temporarily suspend the originally planned joint military defense conference, as military leaders could not easily leave their posts due to ongoing battles in various regions. Gu Zhutong and Li Mo'an were also summoned to attend today's meeting. After the meeting, the Chairman separately summoned Gu Zhutong to provide instructions regarding the joint defense conference of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 24th] The conference on the pacification of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui has been extended to the 28th due to traffic obstruction caused by rain and snow.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that the main topic of the joint defense conference of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan is to discuss the expansion of the organization of the Central China Command and the command issue. Whether a Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters will be established will be decided at the conference. Gu Zhutong arrived in Nanjing from Xuzhou on the 24th to attend the military meeting at the Chairman's official residence. He flew back to Xuzhou by special plane after the meeting, accompanied by Li Mo'an.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] The battle for Xinlitun, a transportation hub and military stronghold in western Liaoning, has entered a critical stage. Although the outer strongholds have almost all been lost, the National Army is making every effort to defend it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] Xinlitun Still Held. After a part of the communist bandits broke through strongholds such as Xiaohuangjintai and Fanjiawopeng on the afternoon of the 23rd, the battle gradually unfolded around the station. The morale of the defending troops is high, and they are steadfastly defending their positions, fiercely attacking the stubborn bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 24th] The communist bandits on the periphery of Jilin have been scattered and routed one after another after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army in various places in recent days. The area around Jilin has now become peaceful.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Sources close to the government reported from the Northeast on the 24th: The battle for Xinlitun has reached a new peak. Communist bandits are continuously sending reinforcements, attempting to capture the city. The dispatch stated: Xinlitun is in "extreme danger." It is claimed that the communist bandits have occupied many high grounds overlooking the city from the north and south. Suicide squads from the bandit side braved the National Army's artillery fire, charging towards the urban area every hour. Hand-to-hand combat has also begun. However, the National Army still occupies the mountainous area of Xinlitun, and the communist bandits' attempt to attack Shuangshanzi failed. The number of communist bandits attacking the city has increased to 30,000, and Xinlitun is isolated.</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Listens to Bandit Suppression Report, Changchun Citizens Excited to Hear of Wei's New Position</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] Wei Lihuang convened a military meeting in the morning of the 24th and held individual talks with generals above the division commander level in the afternoon, listening to bandit suppression reports and opinions. He was extremely busy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The 600,000 citizens of Changchun have been excited in recent days about General Wei Lihuang's appointment as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Northeast. The "opinions" on the streets and alleys mostly "place all hopes on the new organization." The joint edition of Changchun's eight major newspapers today also opened a special column to introduce Wei's deeds and military achievements, and wrote articles supporting the government's decision on bandit suppression in the Northeast, earnestly requesting the authorities to establish the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Changchun, saying that Jilin and Changchun are located in the center of the Northeast. If the military steps for bandit suppression in the Northeast are changed, then Changchun, with its southern connection to Guanmen and its northern control over Songbei, is truly a place that strategists must contend for.</p>
<h3>Peaceful Periphery of Baoding, National Army Completes Deployment, Scattered Bandits Between Xushui and Caohe Cleared</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 24th] The periphery of Baoding is peaceful without any battles. The bandit 6th Column, which fled south, is currently stationed near Wangdu and has not continued south. The main force of the bandit 3rd Column, which passed through Mancheng west of Baoding towards Tang County, has also stopped advancing south in the area of Beibao Beixiang northwest of Fangshun Bridge. The National Army in Baoding has now completed a strong deployment. In addition, the bandits between Xushui and Caohe have been cleared, and security south of Xushui has returned to normal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] The battles in the Pingbao section have subsided. The various columns of Nie Rongzhen's bandits mostly fled along the eastern side of the railway, occupying the areas of Xiong County and Ba County, making the situation in Wuqing increasingly tense. On the 23rd, the National Army near Ba County launched a fierce attack on the bandits, who were unable to withstand it and fled southwest. In addition, most of the bandit troops in the Caohe area fled southwest starting on the evening of the 23rd. Caohe Station was severely damaged and has become desolate. The repair of the railway tracks damaged on the Pinghan Line has been smooth in recent days, and it has been repaired from Gaobeidian to Dingxing on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guihua, 24th] The National Army created brilliant results in the Laishui campaign, reversing the bandit suppression situation in North China. Various sectors in Suiyuan recently organized a comfort delegation for the soldiers of the Laishui campaign, carrying 500 million yuan in comfort money, banners, meat, and other items, and took the Pingbao express train to Ping on the 24th to transfer to the front line for comfort.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 24th] The bandits within Chi City have been swept away by the National Army in coordination with local militia teams in recent days, resulting in a large number of captures. Only scattered remnants of bandits remain, and they should be completely eliminated soon. In addition, the bandits who fled to the borders of Linru, Yichuan, and Yiyang counties have been swept away by local militia teams in separate directions, and the bandits have all fled south.</p>

<p>American Newspaper Reporter Reports After Visiting Suiyuan and Returning to Beiping: Outer Mongolian Army Invades Inner Mongolia, Forcibly Occupying Two Important Locations in Northwest Suiyuan</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 24th] Tracy, a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, who had traveled to Suiyuan, just returned to Beiping and told a United Press reporter today that Outer Mongolia, a vassal state of the Soviet Union, has not only invaded Inner Mongolia, but has even surrounded it. He has obtained much evidence. Since the end of the Sino-Japanese War, no Chinese troops have dared to advance within fifty miles of the Outer Mongolian border. According to Mongolians, there are Outer Mongolian border guards every few miles. Outer Mongolia has occupied at least two important military locations in northwestern Suiyuan and established defenses, one being the Daolisu district and the other being the Soron Mountains near Ningxia. Tracy arrived at a Chinese military outpost in Inner Mongolia eighty miles south of Outer Mongolia. When the Soviet and Outer Mongolian armies withdrew from Bailingmiao and other places in 1945, they took away 300 Inner Mongolian youths, who are still being indoctrinated with communism in Kulun. Outer Mongolian raiding teams often patrol the grasslands of Suiyuan and Chahar, attempting to lure Inner Mongolian youths out of the country. The snow and ice in northern Suiyuan prevent cattle, horses, and sheep from obtaining dry grass, further increasing the poverty of the Mongolians within China. According to the Mongolians, they have not received medical and food relief from China and the United Nations, but it is heard that Mr. Shateji has taken food and medicine there (Note: Mr. Sha is the chairman of the Inner Mongolia Relief Examination Committee). An observation from the south bank of the Yellow River (Hetao) reveals that hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese and Mongolians are suffering from famine. It is reported that Fu Zuoyi is now protecting the rear with militia, but there is a lack of ammunition and training. Although there are no bandits in Suiyuan in practice, the entire territory is very poor due to the war and the stagnation of commerce between Inner and Outer Mongolia. However, everyone speaks well of Fu Zuoyi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 23rd] The bandits who harassed Lanshan and Linwu from the border area of Hunan and Guangdong have fled towards Guangdong after being intercepted by the police force.

<h3>American Newspaper Author Reveals Insider Information on Communist Activities: Holding Meetings in the United States to Oppose Our Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] Wolman, an author for the World Telegram known for exposing Communist activities, recently revealed the insider information on the Communist Party's plan for the "American National Conference on China's Far Eastern Policy" to be held here this weekend. Wolman won the Pulitzer Prize last year for his article in the World Telegram exposing Communist infiltration into American labor and political organizations. He said today that although the name of the above-mentioned conference is very peaceful and without inflammatory elements, it is actually entirely created by the Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee of the Communist Front. The committee has always strived to realize the Soviet Union's desires in Asia. The National Policy Conference claims that its purpose is to promote national "citizen activity" in order to correct policies towards China, Japan, and Korea, but according to Wolman, the purpose of the conference is specifically to oppose the Chinese National Government. According to information obtained by Wolman in advance, the conference will accuse the United States of creating the false independence of the Philippines, causing "economic chaos and political fascism" in Korea, equipping the Japanese army, and planning to subject the Chinese people to autocratic politics. In short, the United States will be accused of causing all the disasters in the Far East, while the Soviet Union will appear in East Asia with a clean slate. Wolman said, "The most ambitious national communist front" launched this conference here a few days ago. The conference is scheduled to be held on the evening of the 23rd, starting with a mass gathering aimed at criticizing "America's secret diplomacy in China." The main speakers at the conference include Ms. Strong and Dr. Wen Youzhang. According to Wolman, Ms. Strong is the founder of the English-language Moscow Daily News and has been active between the United States and the Soviet Union for many years as a Soviet propagandist. Wen Youzhang, on the other hand, "participated in the communist forces in China" and recently resigned from his position as a missionary in Chengdu. Wolman pointed out that the American Communist Party has publicly congratulated this conference. It is said that the list of conference planners, in addition to some new figures, includes 70 well-known figures from the Communist Front. Other speakers are very familiar in China. They include Pearson, who recently served as a special advisor to MacArthur, Field, the so-called "Communist Party Treasurer," and Kahn, a writer on Far Eastern issues. Among the non-Communist planners of the conference is Professor Tugwell, one of the late President Roosevelt's brain trusters. He once served as Governor of Puerto Rico. According to the Communist Daily Worker, Feng Yuxiang will attend the conference as an "observer" on behalf of Li Jishen's so-called "Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee" in Hong Kong. The newspaper also stated that Feng Yuxiang was "instructed" by Li Jishen to attend.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 24th] The Democratic League issued a statement today stating: "The purpose of the Democratic League will never change, but the method of achieving its purpose must be different from what was decided at the previous meeting.

<h3>The Election of Supervisors in Beiping, Ningxia, and Henan Is Invalid</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The pre-election of supervisors in Beiping City and the two provinces of Ningxia and Henan, and those already elected, have been discussed at the State Council meeting on the 23rd. The resolution deemed it invalid, because the election voting date for the supervisors produced by each province and city was originally November 22nd. Later, because that day coincided with the voting day of the National Assembly elections, it was decided to postpone it for one month. Subsequently, the Youth Party Zeng Qi and the Democratic Socialist Party Zhang Junmai both believed that they had not been formally nominated, and had not been consulted or coordinated by the three parties. The usual practice was to postpone it for another month. Now that Beiping, Ningxia, and Henan have all been elected, they should be consulted by the three parties and declared invalid.</p>

<h3>We Have Made Great Progress on the Road to Democracy, Wu Shangying Talks in America</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 23rd] Wu Shangying, Secretary-General of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, who led a delegation from the Chinese Legislative Yuan to visit Europe and the United States for six months, said here on the 23rd, before leaving for China, that he had met with U.S. President Truman and British Prime Minister Attlee. He said, "China has made great progress on the road to democracy, but there is still much work to be done. Communism is a common problem for the world, and China is only one front in the fight against communism. We are planning to stop communism in China, but we must use both economic and military means to achieve success. Simply suppressing communism with military force will not succeed. The Chinese government does not intend to consider appeasing the Communist Party, but hopes for American assistance to solve this problem." Wu also said: China's first Legislative Yuan election is similar to the American Congress, although we have the strongest political party, other parties also have the opportunity to compete. The Chinese are tending towards democracy, but the road has to be slower. The big problem of illiteracy, the plight of the masses living in hardship, and the centuries-old old-fashioned agriculture must all be solved one by one before China can have a truly democratic government. However, I have great confidence in the example of the government and the United States.</p>
<h3>The Total Amount of Loan Funds for Last Year Reached More Than 6 Trillion Yuan, The Southward Transportation of Coal from Kaiyuan Almost All Supplied to Shanghai, The Four Joint Offices and the Ministry of Economic Affairs Answer Inquiries from Supervisors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Supervisors Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting continued to go to the Four Joint Offices and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the afternoon of the 24th to investigate and inquire about the total amount and distribution of loan funds for last year and the general situation of the southward transportation of coal from Kaiyuan.

<h3>Chairman Concerned About the People's Suffering in North China, to Receive Petitioners Tomorrow to Hear Report</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Chairman Chiang will receive five representatives from the North China Petition Delegation at 11:30 AM on the 26th to hear direct reports on the overall political and military situation in North China, as well as public opinion and the people's suffering. The Petition Delegation had no major activities on the 24th, other than visiting senior figures from the North in Nanjing.

They are scheduled to hold further talks with the Executive Yuan the day after tomorrow regarding the return of the Mentougou coal mine.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Spokesperson of the Ministry of Food stated: The speakers of the Hebei, Peiping, and Tianjin Provincial Assemblies, along with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, came to Nanjing to petition for a solution to the North China economic crisis. During discussions with Minister of Food Yu, it was reported that a permit fee of 150,000 yuan was required for each bag of flour transported from Shanghai to Peiping and Tianjin. This increased the cost for grain merchants, leading to higher prices that citizens found difficult to bear. Minister Yu explained that, according to Article 5 of the "Regulations for the Management of Food Circulation" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry determines the total amount of flour that can be transferred monthly from flour mills in various provinces and cities along the Yangtze River. This amount is allocated to the Flour Association in each region, based on the actual production of each member factory in that region. The allocation and the quantity to be transported to each sales location are then reported to the Ministry, which in turn informs the customs to release the goods. Legal grain merchants must negotiate and purchase flour within the allocated quota from each factory, and the factory is not allowed to raise prices or engage in speculation. The Ministry has no regulation requiring any permit fee for the transfer of flour. If flour mills deliberately raise prices, collect extra permit fees, or collect fees under false pretenses when negotiating quota transfers, such actions are illegal. He asked that if anyone had evidence, they should provide it so that the Ministry could send personnel to investigate thoroughly and take legal action. The Ministry has already dispatched three officials to investigate this matter in various regions. (News of Food Minister Yu Feipeng's arrival in Shanghai is published on page 4).</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Xu Gongrang and others, supervisors dispatched by the Ministry of Food to Shanghai to investigate the collection of permit fees for flour transported from Shanghai to Peiping and Tianjin, left Nanjing by train at approximately 4:00 PM on the 24th. They are determined to begin their work within a short period and return to Nanjing to report promptly.</p>
<h3>Chu Hsi-ch'un to go to Peiping at the end of the month, Hopei Provincial Government can be reorganized and established immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 24th] Relevant sources received a telegram from Chu Hsi-ch'un stating that he is currently in Shenyang completing the handover and will arrive in Peiping at the end of the month to take office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 24th] The reorganized Hopei Provincial Government can be established in the near future. The newly appointed Director of Civil Affairs Yu Chunzhai and Director of Finance Wang Pingbin departed for Peiping together on the morning of the 23rd.

<h3>Siam Prohibits Overseas Chinese Schools from Displaying National Flag, Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Considers Countermeasures, Decision on Whether to Recognize Current Siamese Government is Temporarily Deferred</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Regarding the Siamese government's violation of treaty obligations (Ambassador Li Tiehzeng had signed an agreement with the previous Siamese government regarding the selection of overseas Chinese education matters), and the renewed prohibition of overseas Chinese schools in Siam from displaying the national flag, an official from the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters on the 24th that the Ministry has received the report and is carefully studying the attitude to be adopted. The claim in the evening newspapers in Nanjing that the government will protest to Siam is completely wrong. Although China still has an embassy in Bangkok, it has not yet recognized the current Siamese government, making it impossible to conduct negotiations. In response to a reporter's question about whether the government is considering recognizing the current Siamese government and conducting negotiations with it, the official replied, "There is nothing I can tell you about this matter at the moment." This "moment" is quite suggestive.</p>
<h3>President Chang Discusses with Foreign Reporters, Time Not Ripe for Currency System Reform, Our Foreign Exchange Measures Can Already Curb the Black Market</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] President Chang Chun met exclusively with reporters from this agency on the afternoon of the 24th, stating that the time for China to implement currency system reform is not yet ripe. The Executive Yuan has been considering financial reform for quite some time, and various government ministries are drafting measures to cope with China's current financial and economic crisis. President Chang further stated that the government's foreign exchange control policy will not change, and current measures are already able to curb black market activities. Once the recently signed anti-smuggling agreement between China and Hong Kong is fully effective, foreign exchange black market transactions can be completely eliminated. Foreign exchange controls can be applied for a long period of time; Britain has successfully implemented such controls during its current financial crisis. Regarding American aid, President Chang expressed that loans of any size are most welcome by China. Chang also said that the Chinese technical advisory group led by Bei Zuyi has not yet submitted a report from Washington, but the group has been in contact with the State Department, and he anticipates that the United States will provide China with some financial assistance. President Chang then discussed the new economic plan under consideration by the government, pointing out that certain restrictions are absolutely necessary to maintain the balance of the budget for the current fiscal year. Imports of essential goods should be handled as much as possible through barter trade to save foreign exchange. The government will also strive to expand exports, and if necessary, the government will purchase goods domestically and export them overseas, as the New Zealand government has done. China will strive to balance imports and exports, and the newly revised import and export plan will greatly help to balance this year's budget. When asked about the amount needed to stabilize the national currency, President Chang declined to disclose anything, saying that the estimated figures published in the newspapers were purely speculative and did not represent the government's opinion. He stated that the plan to stabilize the national currency is still under close review, and no figures can be provided at this time. When discussing possible currency system reforms, President Chang stated that the government is considering more than two reform systems, but he was unwilling to say whether China would adopt the gold standard system recommended by Kung Hsiang-hsi. Chang denied that the Chinese government is in talks with the Mexican government to purchase silver. He said, "I did not know about this plan until I learned about it from the newspapers. The government has not formally contacted the Mexican government; this is another speculative claim." Chang further confirmed that China's legal tender issuance has exceeded 28 trillion yuan. Finally, President Chang expressed his confidence, stating that "China's future is bright. Britain was able to overcome its difficulties during and after the war, and China will also become stronger after overcoming its current crisis. However, the Chinese people still need to work harder and show the spirit of struggle that the British people showed during difficult times."</p>

<h3>Reforming the Monetary System and Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>Inflation has reached such a stage that only currency reform can save the situation. Recently, the talk of currency reform has been rampant, and many people have advocated for immediate reform. The greatest purpose of currency reform is to stabilize the value of the currency, and whether the new currency value can be stabilized and whether the reform technique is appropriate are certainly important, but the basic conditions for reform are even more important. Currency reform can certainly help stabilize prices and restore balance to the general economic situation, but it does not mean that once the currency system is reformed, all economic problems can be automatically and fundamentally solved. It still depends on positive measures in all aspects of the economy. In other words, only with the existence of good basic conditions can currency reform have complete success. Otherwise, if the basic conditions are unfavorable, the reform may be in vain, and even if it is effective, it will only be temporary. Currency reform is of great importance to the economic future, so the basic conditions should be carefully considered, and the authorities should be determined to correct the current economic situation so that it can be promoted in conjunction with currency reform measures in order to achieve the practical effect of stabilizing prices and revitalizing the economy.</p>
<p>In the past, the authorities have repeatedly changed their countermeasures for price measures, but all have been ineffective. Not only have they failed to suppress prices, but they have not even been able to slow down the rise in prices. In the past year alone, there were three periodic price surges and several minor price surges. Prices continued to rise, the magnitude of the increase expanded, and the rest period shortened, causing economic turmoil and making people's lives unbearable. Even the current credit tightening policy, although more reasonable, can only have a temporary effect. The current credit tightening policies are: ① Stopping loans from national banks, but because loans account for a very small proportion of the circulating funds in the industrial and commercial sectors, the amount of money that can be tightened by stopping loans is very limited. ② Restricting domestic remittances, as the large-scale collection of funds from various regions in Shanghai promotes the flooding of money, which is a major driving force for price fluctuations. Restricting domestic remittances can certainly have a tightening effect on money, but this effect is offset after the phenomenon of transporting cash occurs. ③ Selling materials, because the quantity is relatively large, the amount of money that can be tightened is also larger, but ultimately the quantity is limited and cannot fully absorb the increased currency issuance. If the sale of old materials could fully absorb the increased currency issuance, then the fiscal deficit would not have to be covered by issuance, but could be offset by the proceeds from the sale of old materials. ④ Banning the black market for gold and banknotes, in the hope of reducing the stimulus of gold and banknote fluctuations on materials, but the black market for gold and banknotes can never be completely eliminated by administrative pressure. It depends on a reasonable change in foreign exchange policy. If the ban is ineffective, the disturbing factors for prices will still exist, and if the ban is effective, floating capital will inevitably turn to the commodity market. ⑤ Inspecting the business of banks and firms, even if it is effective, can only control a small portion of social funds, and its effect is self-evident.</p>
<p>The price problem is so serious that no minor measures can be effective. Even the current credit tightening policy can only have a temporary effect and cannot be sustained. Therefore, we can say that under the legal tender system, prices are no longer stable. However, the economic crisis cannot be allowed to continue, and a solution must be found urgently. Therefore, currency reform is indeed imminent. Although currency reform can give hope for an improvement in the economic situation, it does not mean that once the reform is implemented, the price problem can be fundamentally solved and reach a stable state. Because the factors contributing to the price problem are extremely complex: ① the excessive fiscal deficit, ② the decline in production, ③ the imbalance in foreign exchange supply and demand, and ④ the acceleration of currency circulation. These problems are indeed difficult to solve, so how can they be automatically eliminated after currency reform? Because currency reform itself cannot fundamentally improve finance or increase foreign exchange income, it only alleviates the crisis to facilitate the advancement of rescue work. Under the legal tender system, there is not even this opportunity for improvement.</p>
<p>If, after currency reform, the fundamental correction of the economic situation is not carried out, then this reform will only be a change of units, what is the meaning of that? If inflation continues after the reform, then prices will still not be stable, because the end of inflation can only be realized after the fundamental problems are resolved. Currency reform is a major economic undertaking, and we must not allow the adverse economic situation to undermine it after the reform. We must thoroughly correct the economic status quo and help the success of currency reform. We strongly support currency reform and also hope that it will be successful soon so that the economy can get on the road to recovery and the threat to people's lives can be eliminated. However, in stabilizing prices after currency reform, we should give more consideration and would like to offer a few suggestions for reference.</p>
<p>First, price stability cannot be achieved after currency reform. The most important thing is whether the balance of financial revenue and expenditure can be achieved. Therefore, the first prerequisite for currency reform is to actively reorganize finances in order to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. After currency reform, the tax law can be made more practical, and the tax revenue can be substantially increased due to the elimination of the lag in tax revenue purchasing power. On the expenditure side, it is no longer necessary to infinitely expand due to price fluctuations, and the budget figures are closer to actual needs, which should be beneficial to improving the financial revenue and expenditure situation. However, looking at the current budget, even if prices are completely stable and the budget is strictly implemented, there will still be a huge gap in financial revenue and expenditure. How to make up for this deficit is a very important issue. If it is not made up for properly and is covered by issuance again, then the reformed new currency system will soon be on the road to expansion again. Therefore, currency reform only gives financial revenue and expenditure an opportunity to improve, but it cannot improve finance itself. We must actively use all possible methods and take advantage of this opportunity to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure, and then use the balance of financial revenue and expenditure to consolidate the foundation of the new currency system. Balancing financial revenue and expenditure is indeed not easy. We must be determined to implement the following necessary measures: ① strictly implement the budget so that the expenditure situation can be controlled. ② Open up new taxes to increase tax revenue, but the burden of the new taxes should be limited to the wealthy class. The current practice of avoiding the important and focusing on increasing indirect tax rates is of no use. ③ Cut and merge redundant institutions to reduce unnecessary expenditures in order to be closer to the revenue. ④ The fiscal deficit should no longer be covered by issuance, and the policy of raising debts should be adopted instead. Issuing public bonds may not be easy after currency reform, but it can be done if a higher interest rate is offered. ⑤ The overdraft of the national treasury to the Central Bank can only be limited to temporary shortfalls, and the amount of the overdraft must also be limited so as not to affect currency inflation.</p>
<p>Second, at the same time as currency reform, the exchange rate must be reasonably adjusted. Improper adjustment will inevitably cause economic turmoil, and the new currency system will ultimately fail. If the exchange rate is set too low, not only will the trade deficit increase and foreign exchange be lost, making it difficult to maintain, but the large-scale import of foreign goods can certainly help lower domestic prices, but industry will also fall into decline. In order to adapt to the future environment, it is better to underestimate the new exchange rate than to overestimate it. Underestimation can save foreign exchange and make currency reform easier to succeed. The adjustment of the exchange rate is still a technical issue, and whether it can achieve lasting stability depends on the reasonable adjustment of the international balance of payments. In the future, strict import controls must still be adopted to reduce foreign exchange expenditures, and active exports and absorption of overseas Chinese funds must be used to increase foreign exchange funds. In particular, capital flight must be thoroughly stopped to prevent the balance of international payments from being disrupted. If the international balance of payments cannot be balanced, even if the exchange rate is reasonable, it will not be stable for long. How can prices be stable if the exchange rate is not stable? Although the exchange rate and prices are mutually causal and cyclical, if the exchange rate can be stabilized, prices can also have a more stable factor.</p>
<p>Third, the current imbalance in the supply and demand of materials is indeed a major factor in price volatility. Even if currency issuance is stopped and the exchange rate is stabilized, the imbalance in the supply and demand of materials will still disrupt price stability. To restore the balance of material supply and demand, the only way is to increase production and save consumption. To increase production, the most important thing is to ensure the supply of raw materials, and everything else is just an auxiliary method. We ask the authorities to restrict the import of finished products and temporarily suspend the import of non-essential goods, and use all foreign exchange positions to import raw materials as much as possible to alleviate the current serious panic over the lack of raw materials. Saving consumption cannot be achieved by orders alone. It must be done practically in order to be beneficial to reality. Furthermore, artificial needs such as speculative hoarding must be effectively curbed. As for curbing, it must not be like in the past. Heavy penalties must be used in troubled times, otherwise it will not be effective. With a sufficient supply of materials, even if there is still a slight increase in issuance at the beginning of currency reform, the inflationary trend can be resisted by it, so it can play a major role in currency reform.</p>
<p>Fourth, the acceleration of currency circulation is the result of people's loss of confidence in the monetary system. This is why the current rate of price increase far exceeds the rate of currency issuance. If the speed of circulation can be reduced, the rate of price increase can be greatly slowed down. This is the case now, and it is even more important during currency reform. Some people believe that currency reform will drastically reduce the speed of currency circulation, but judging from the current lack of interest in the monetary system, it will probably be difficult to achieve the ideal in the future. In order to reduce the speed of currency circulation during currency reform, active measures must be taken. Freeze part of the floating capital to weaken the activity of the floating capital; raise interest rates to tighten credit; encourage the increase of capital in industry and commerce to absorb part of the floating capital into production.</p>
<p>In short, relying solely on currency reform without making efforts in other aspects will still be difficult to be effective. Therefore, these four points are specifically put forward as a reference for policy implementation during currency reform.</p>

<h3>Statements from the Burmese Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Yesterday, Mr. U met with reporters at the International Hotel and stated: The Chinese in Burma are very friendly with the Burmese people, and their relationship is extremely close. Over the years, no disputes have ever occurred. My visit here is to seek to bring the people of the two countries even closer and more friendly. He also said: Currently, there are approximately one million Chinese in Burma, including those of mixed Chinese-Burmese descent. Most of them take pride in opening shops, and some are technicians and carpenters. The educational level of the Chinese in Burma is also quite high, and they are free to enter any school. At the same time, there are also Mandarin language schools. In Burma, 95 percent of the population is literate.</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Burmese trade, Mr. U stated that due to transportation difficulties after the war, the trade volume between the two countries has decreased by about half compared to before the war. However, he believes that it will definitely increase in the future, and he will also do his best to promote progress during his visit to China. The Burma Road is still passable, but there is a lack of transportation. In the past, Burma mainly purchased cotton yarn from China, while China imported mostly raw cotton from Burma, as well as a small amount of grain.</p>
<p>Mr. U also stated that the biggest difficulty Burma has encountered after the war is the lack of transportation. Railways were destroyed during the war, resulting in heavy losses. In addition, the labor problem is also extremely serious, with wages being four times higher than before the war, making it difficult for production to compete with other countries. As for clothing and food, they can still cope. According to his estimation, the reconstruction of Burma will take five years if "luck is good," but it will not exceed ten years at the latest.</p>
<p>Mr. U studied law at Cambridge University in London in his early years. Before becoming ambassador, he served as the president of the Rangoon Court. During the war, he served in the Burmese Army.</p>
<h3>Australia Celebrates National Day Tomorrow: Copeland's Declaration Pays Tribute to China</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, this city] The 26th is Australia's National Day. Professor Copeland, the Australian Minister to China, issued a National Day declaration, in which he highly praised China's heroic achievements in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The declaration stated: "On behalf of the Australian government and people, I would like to extend my congratulations to the leaders and people of the Republic of China, and hope that China will complete its unification and construction before the next Australian National Day. Without China's unification, there can be no peace and progress in the hemisphere we live in. The Australian people deeply admire the Chinese people for being the first to independently resist Japan. Australia is honored to have participated in the Pacific War and ultimately defeated the enemy. Without China's eight-year War of Resistance, Australia would not have been able to defend against the enemy and would undoubtedly have been conquered. Australia's ability to avoid the humiliation of invasion is due to the Chinese people's heroic resistance, which restrained a large amount of the enemy's material and human resources. Otherwise, Australia's independence and security would have been severely threatened. On this National Day, Australia cannot help but express its gratitude and admiration to the Chinese government and people for their eight years of arduous resistance."</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of U.S. Military Officer Graham's Smuggling Case</h3>
<p>Tianjin Customs Commissioner Testifies in Court</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The trial of U.S. Marine Corps officer Graham's smuggling case continued in Tianjin on the 24th. Shou Wen, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, was specially invited to testify in court. Mr. Shou explained in detail the Chinese government's customs import regulations and stated that the defendant Graham had imported two cars in January 1947 in his capacity as a U.S. military officer. One car was imported duty-free in accordance with government regulations, while the other was taxed by the customs. His intention may have been to sell the car immediately after import, because according to Chinese government regulations, every U.S. military officer, as certified by his superior officer and his consul, is allowed to import one car duty-free. The customs inspectors signed and released the cars because they did not realize that the two owners were the same person. However, although the military officer had imported the cars, he still violated Chinese customs regulations. Later, Zhang Runsheng, the acting deputy director of the Tianjin District Office of the Import and Export Control Committee, was invited to inquire about the import regulations. The plaintiff's witnesses have finished testifying, and the defendant still needs to summon other witnesses. The case will be heard again on the 26th.</p>

<h3>Measures for Prioritized Purchase or Lease of Enemy and Puppet Factories Not Sold in Two Auctions</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The measures for prioritized purchase or lease of enemy and puppet factories not sold in two auctions in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas by relocated factories from the rear areas, after being revised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Central Trust Bureau, have been presented to the Executive Yuan for amendment and approval. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>① Enemy and puppet factories and factory equipment that have not been sold after being auctioned more than twice may be prioritized for purchase or lease by relocated factories from the rear areas.</p>
<p>② Purchasers or lessees are limited to private factories that have made a real contribution to wartime production during the War of Resistance and must be registered with the Ministry.</p>
<p>③ The qualifications of the purchaser or lessee shall be certified by the National Industrial Association or the United Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. If two or more parties apply to purchase or lease the same enemy and puppet factory, the above two associations shall determine the order of priority, which shall be reviewed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to determine the purchaser or lessee. The first priority shall be given to specialized factories over non-specialized factories, and the second priority shall be given to two or more parties jointly applying over one factory applying alone.</p>
<p>④ In accordance with the Executive Yuan's decree, the measures for relocated factories from the rear areas to purchase or lease enemy and puppet factories are divided into four items: ① Pay in full within one month according to the valuation of the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office. ② Pay 80% in full within one month according to the valuation of the Clearing Office. ③ Pay one-third first according to the valuation of the Clearing Office, pay another one-third within three months, and pay the remaining amount within another three months. ④ Leasing measures are specified separately.</p>
<p>⑤ Applicants may choose one of the four methods stipulated in Article 4 to apply, but the approved priority order is as follows: those who pay in full at once have the highest priority, followed by those who pay 80% at once, followed by those who pay in installments, and then those who lease.</p>
<p>⑥ The leasing measures are as follows: (A) The leased objects are limited to factory buildings, land, and machinery and equipment. The remaining finished products, raw materials, and tools shall be sold to the lessee at market prices on a priority basis. (B) The rent shall be calculated by combining the interest on the price and the depreciation of use. The interest shall be calculated at a monthly rate of one cent per thousand based on the estimated price of the leased object, and the depreciation shall be calculated according to the depreciation rate stipulated in the Income Tax Law. (C) The lease term is limited to two years. (D) No extension is allowed upon expiration. The lessee shall have priority to purchase it in full at once according to the estimated price at that time, multiplied by the depreciation rate. If they are unwilling to purchase, it shall be auctioned.</p>
<p>⑦ The application procedures for purchase or lease shall be handled by the National Industrial Association entrusted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in conjunction with the United Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi. Matters such as accepting applications, certifying qualifications, and suggesting priority order shall be handled separately.</p>
<p>⑧ After the purchaser or lessee is approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and submitted to the Clearing Office for approval, they shall fill out a letter of intent, pay the money, sign a contract, and go through the handover procedures in accordance with the old factory measures at the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office.</p>
<p>⑨ After purchasing or leasing, the purchaser or lessee shall actively resume work. The purchaser and the lessee shall not sublet, resell, or sublease.</p>
<p>⑩ The list of factories that have not been sold after being auctioned more than twice shall be based on the results up to the sixth auction for the first batch, and the remaining factory names shall be notified in batches successively after being auctioned twice.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Concludes Foreign Policy Debate, Sternly Condemns Communism, Vows to Exert Utmost Effort to Eliminate War</h3>
<p>The Western European Union Does Not Exclude Participation from Other Parts of the World</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Prime Minister Attlee, in his address during the House of Commons foreign policy debate today, stated that he did not believe war was imminent, but it was still necessary to exert the utmost effort to eliminate the causes of war. Attlee also reiterated the assurance made by Foreign Secretary Bevin in the House of Commons yesterday, that the proposal to establish a European Union does not exclude the possibility of participation from the rest of the world. Amid cheers, Attlee emphasized: [We do not intend to force our free system upon Europe and other parts of the world, and we equally demand that others not force their system upon us.] Attlee then directly addressed Stalin and communism, saying: [Stalin, as a pragmatist, must acknowledge that his proposed communist plan for Britain has completely failed. Britain is willing to establish the friendliest relations with the Soviet Union, and there is no conflict between the two great nations, but the British people are not prepared to accept communism and firmly oppose the communist way of life. Stalin should abandon the notion that Britain will become communist. Britain resolutely opposes the communist concept of unity. Today, in terms of human rights, the Soviet Union is at the very end of the line. The essence of democracy is to allow free discussion of different opinions and to tolerate the opinions of others. Our ideal world is a world with somewhat different opinions, while the communist world wants to make other countries, such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, into little Russias. To maintain its position against the communist offensive, Western Europe must achieve unity. However, unity is different from uniformity. If we hold the notion of uniformity, it will hinder our entire goal. Although we hope that other countries can implement democratic socialism, Britain must not interfere. However, I believe that although their doctrines are different, they share a common belief that there must be a balanced economy in the modern world, and therefore it does not hinder their joint cooperation. The [unregulated system of free enterprise capitalism] of the nineteenth century is now dead.] Attlee outlined the Marshall Plan, saying: [Except for those who are prepared to achieve their doctrine through the starvation and death of millions of people, I cannot understand the opposition of others to the Marshall Plan. Britain must have the opportunity to provide great leadership to the Marshall Plan. The meeting of the sixteen European countries may soon be reconvened to adapt its ideas to the recent situation.] Attlee then addressed the proposal for a Western European Union, saying [The establishment of a union of Western European countries and their overseas territories is an unprecedented courageous attempt by mankind. The European Union is completed within the larger framework of the United Nations. Although it is called the European Union, it does not exclude the possibility of participation from other parts of the world.] Attlee also revealed the possibility of establishing a European customs union, which has been reviewed and is now going through its inevitable technical phase in Brussels.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Western European Anti-Soviet Bloc, US Agrees to Bevin Plan, Believes It Sufficient to Lay the Foundation for Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The State Department issued a formal statement today, agreeing with British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to unite Western Europe, stating, [The measures proposed by Bevin can enable the free countries of Western Europe to engage in more urgent unity for common security and welfare. The United States deeply welcomes this proposal. Any proposal that promotes the material and spiritual ties of Western Europe is sufficient to strengthen the joint efforts of the United States and Britain to lay the foundation for peace. It is recognized here that the Bevin Plan is for the establishment of a Western European anti-Soviet bloc. This proposition, as well as Churchill's warning that the international situation is deteriorating, can give greater strength to those who support the Marshall Plan.]</p>
<p>The publication of the Bevin Plan, coming after the State Department's announcement of the Hitler-Molotov Pact, makes the opposing forces of the two worlds more obvious. Many American newspapers used maps to show the position of the "Bevin Group," whose state is no less than the opposing forces of the Allied and enemy countries during wartime. At the same time, talk of war has therefore been revived, and it is even said that Forrestal's announcement of his withdrawal from the presidential race is to prepare to preside over national defense again in an emergency. Diplomatic figures also compared Bevin's speech with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in March 1939 after the Nazis occupied Prague. Chamberlain's policy of appeasement was abandoned after that speech. Although no one here accuses Bevin of having tried to adopt a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union in the past, Britain's past position was indeed to act as a mediator between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg All Agree</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 23rd] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak said that Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech yesterday was a milestone in the history of Europe, especially in the history of Asia and Europe. The British and French proposal to extend the Dunkirk Treaty to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has received sympathy here and is being considered by the responsible authorities. The Netherlands and Luxembourg also welcomed this. The three countries will soon have the opportunity to compare opinions on this matter. I very much agree with Bevin's statement that political agreements must be supplemented by economic agreements. Bevin's words have launched a powerful movement, which, together with the Marshall Plan, can quickly restore the balance of power in Europe.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Decides to Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bern, 23rd] It is recognized here that Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech in the House of Commons yesterday indicates that Britain has finally acknowledged the division of Europe. Swiss officials therefore specifically stated that Switzerland will continue to maintain neutrality. The Swiss economic delegation has departed for Moscow to promote economic ties between the two countries, while at the same time the British and French [Marshall Plan] delegation will come to Switzerland on Tuesday. This shows Switzerland's absolute neutrality. Swiss officials also stated that Switzerland's participation in the Marshall Plan is purely for economic reasons.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Policy Debate Involves Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 24th] When Foreign Secretary Bevin spoke in the House of Commons on British foreign policy, he specifically mentioned the future peace treaty with Japan. He said that it was very difficult to obtain Soviet agreement on this matter, because the Soviet Union wanted the issue of signing a peace treaty with Japan to be discussed by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Bevin said, [Before the Soviet Union went to war with Japan, if the Soviet Union had then deployed troops along the coastal provinces, it might have had an impact, but the Soviet Union actually only fought Japan for a few days. And what I ask you to agree to is that the countries that fought Japan to the end should occupy a superior position among the Allied countries. What we propose is that a peace treaty conference should be composed of thirteen or fourteen countries.]</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] When the House of Commons discussed foreign policy today involving the Far East, Labour MP Paget declared that American policy towards Japan should be supported by democratic countries around the world. Conservative MP Dairn said that the British government's cautious attitude has put Britons in Japan in a shameful position and caused Britain to lose the opportunity to participate in the country's future development.</p>
<h3>British, American, and French Conference to Discuss the Merger of West German Occupation Zones, Scheduled to Be Held in London in Mid-March</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Reliable sources say that the conference of the British, American, and French to discuss the West German issue may be held in London between February 17 and 19. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the central issue of the meeting would be to discuss the institutions of West Germany based on the recent resolution of the Frankfurt Conference. France has objections to the Frankfurt resolution, which will naturally be discussed at the meeting. The spokesman also said that if this meeting can produce immediate results, it can give West Germany a good opportunity to overcome the current situation.</p>
<h3>Marshall Abandons Hope of Concluding Austrian Peace Treaty Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Marshall accepted the resignation of Dodge, a former banker at the Detroit Bank who is now an aide negotiating the Austrian peace treaty, on the 24th, so Marshall has already abandoned hope of concluding the Austrian peace treaty soon.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Asks US to Modify Wartime Lend-Lease Terms and Consider Soviet Union's Wartime Achievements</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] According to TASS, Washington: The Soviet Union has proposed that the United States "comprehensively consider" the Soviet Army's contribution to the victory in this war and modify the terms for resolving the $20 billion lend-lease bill. According to the Soviet Union, it has submitted a note to the United States on December 16, suggesting the conclusion of an agreement on this matter.</p>
<h3>Hungary and Romania Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 25th broadcast: Budapest, Hungary and Romania have signed a 20-year treaty of friendship and military mutual assistance, stipulating that joint military action must be taken against any attacker.</p>
<h3>French Government Disregards British Opposition and Resolves to Devalue the Franc</h3>
<p>Cripps Arrives in Paris for Talks with Mayer</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The French government decided on the 24th to devalue the franc and establish a free market for gold and certain foreign currencies. A communiqué announced that the cabinet meeting had passed a bill to be submitted to the National Assembly stipulating the rules for the gold and foreign exchange markets. It is not yet known whether France's franc system has been modified to respond to Britain's stance. A French government spokesman only said: British negotiators expressed extreme goodwill and understanding of the situation in France. British and French delegation members kept secret the content of the talks between Cripps and Mayer this morning. Cripps is scheduled to meet with Finance Minister Mayer this afternoon.</p>
<h3>US Business and Industry Groups Unanimously Support Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The Executive Committee of the Congress of American Industrial Organizations today reiterated its support for the Marshall Plan to aid Europe and guaranteed that 6 million members would make a frontal attack on the front lines of anti-inflation and wages.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The National Association of Manufacturers and the Committee for Economic Development today jointly urged that the Marshall Plan to aid Europe be removed from the jurisdiction of the State Department. The two groups and AFL President Green unanimously guaranteed full support for the completion of the goals of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Firmly Refuses to Run for US President</h3>
<p>Vandenberg and Dewey's Calls Grow Louder Again</p>
<p>[United Press, Almuni City, New York, 24th] Marshal Eisenhower firmly stated that he does not intend to run for president. Republican officials in New York believe on the 24th that New York Governor Dewey's election as the Republican candidate is a foregone conclusion. Although Dewey announced through his press secretary that he had "no opinion" on this, Dewey's supporters did not conceal their optimism. Senior government leaders expressed the opinion that Eisenhower's withdrawal may eliminate the threat of Marshal MacArthur being nominated, because Eisenhower's rejection statement also warned soldiers not to get involved in politics.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] Fander, publisher of the Manchester [Union Leader] of New Hampshire, pointed out on the 23rd that although Eisenhower has announced his refusal to run for president, his supporters will continue to nominate candidates on his behalf.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] After Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower issued a statement declining nomination as the Republican presidential candidate, Republican Senator Vandenberg's calls rose again. However, Vandenberg himself had stated that he could not be forced without his consent, but he also said that if the title of presidential candidate was added to him, no one could refuse.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Expresses No Opinion on Eisenhower's Statement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Marshal MacArthur told the United Press on the 24th that he had "no criticism" of Marshal Eisenhower's announcement rejecting the presidential race. As such, Eisenhower's statement does not seem to have an immediate impact on MacArthur's position. General observers believe that MacArthur is taking a "wait-and-see" stance. However, among the occupation forces who admire MacArthur, they believe that since Eisenhower stated that professional soldiers should not covet the神器 of the presidency, he is actually hindering MacArthur's possible ambitions. MacArthur's name has been included in the Wisconsin presidential primary list, although MacArthur has not yet stated that he is willing to run as a candidate. He has so far insisted that he will remain in Japan until the end of the occupation duties. However, he has never declared that if the Republican Party pushes him as a presidential candidate, he will refuse.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer to Be Awarded Permanent Major General Title</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The US Senate unanimously passed today to award Lieutenant General Wedemeyer the title of permanent major general.</p>
<h3>Britain Asks US to Mediate Dispute Between India and Pakistan</h3>
<p>US Government Has Refused</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 23rd] Reliable sources say that the US government has refused Britain's invitation to lead the promotion of the United Nations to resolve the dispute between India and Pakistan. It is said that US officials believe that the United States should not come forward while the Security Council is trying to end the dispute. It is believed that the United States has no close relationship with its foreign policy interests because of the Indian-Pakistani dispute, so it has not taken active action in the Security Council. Britain believes that the Indian-Pakistani incident is more volatile than the Palestinian incident. Unless the United States comes forward to lead the drafting of a plan that can be accepted by both India and Pakistan without either party losing face and power, the Security Council may not be able to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 24th] The United Nations Security Council's discussion of the dispute between India and Pakistan is nearing the voting stage today. It is learned that the question of sovereignty over Kashmir will be decided by the people of the state.</p>
<h3>US and Britain Plan to Establish a Chain of Air Force Bases in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] It is reported that British and American representatives have met in London to discuss a tentative plan to establish a chain of British and American air force bases in Cyrenaica, North Africa. The main ones will be in the Benghazi area, and several bases will also be established near Tobruk.</p>
<p>The El Adem airfield in the area during the war still exists today. British troops withdrawing from Palestine may be transferred to Cyprus, Benghazi, and Tripoli. These new bases may be smaller than the air transport base reopened by the United States near Hellaia in Tripoli. The future of any base will depend on the decision of the four-power foreign ministers' representatives on the establishment of a former colony. However, the establishment of a base in Cyrenaica, even if it is temporary, will be of great use for maintaining British and American control in the eastern Mediterranean and the transportation line to the Middle East oil area. Before Britain withdraws from the Holy Land and establishes permanent bases in East Africa, the bases in North Africa will occupy a very important position.</p>
<h3>General Strike of One Million Workers in the State of Bavaria Has Ended, Clay Returns Home to Urge Appropriation of Funds for Grain Transportation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 24th] The 24-hour strike launched by the Bavarian trade union to protest the lack of food ended at midnight yesterday. Railway and tram night shift workers all reported at midnight. The Bavarian government has promised to take immediate steps to deal with the lack of food. Nearly one million workers throughout Bavaria participated in the general strike. After meeting with the chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions, Hagen, and the Bavarian government, it was decided that the trade union and the farmers' association would draft a food plan as the basis for the government's future actions. In addition, it was decided to ask the Economic Committee of the merged zone in Frankfurt to do its best to promote emergency measures to alleviate the famine. The stability of the Ruhr area is mainly due to the concrete indications that the German administrative authorities and the Allied authorities will soon make efforts to alleviate the famine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, revealed here today that his return to the country was to request Congress to approve the appropriation of $700 million to increase the average food ration in the British and American merged zone in Germany to 1,800 calories per person per day. Clay also believes that although the current labor unrest in the Ruhr will tempt the communist forces to invade the merged zone, it can also stimulate German political leaders to take responsibility for forcing German farmers to sell their grain.</p>
<h3>South Korean Police Chief Assassinated, Assailant Confesses to Being a Communist</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 24th] South Korea has passed through months of peaceful security, but now new terrorist activities have been discovered. This morning, someone threw four grenades at Seoul Police Chief Jang Taek-sang. Jang was only slightly injured and spared, but one of his attendants was seriously injured. One of the three assassins was arrested and two escaped. According to Jang, the arrested assassin has confessed to being a communist. The three assassins were mixed in the crowd who were clearing the snow in front of Jang's residence. They threw four grenades as Jang got into his car. Jang's arm was injured in the blast, and a young assassin was arrested while throwing the fifth grenade.</p>
<h3>General Strike in Northern Italy</h3>
<p>Scheduled to End at Midnight on the 24th</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 24th] Communist trade unions are apparently following the party's new strategy to strike at the government. They began testing their strength on the 24th by launching a 24-hour general strike. Florence and its surrounding 49 towns have been hit hard. Work stopped at midnight on the 23rd and is scheduled to end at midnight on the 24th. No accidents have occurred so far.</p>
<h3>Hirano Protests to Katayama Regarding Purge</h3>
<p>Believes It Was Not a Fair Decision</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Former Agriculture Minister Hirano Rikizo protested to Prime Minister Katayama on the 22nd, saying that according to the certificate submitted to him by Commissioner Okawachi, the decision to purge him was not based on an independent vote, but was carried out by trickery, so the decision was naturally invalid. He also notified Speaker Matsuoka that he would not accept the notice of his purge for the same reason.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Republican Cabinet Resigns En Masse, Hatta Ordered to Form New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Indonesians Accuse Former Prime Minister of Succumbing to the Dutch</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 23rd] The Indonesian Republican Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Sjahrir, submitted its resignation en masse today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] Indonesian President Sukarno has instructed Vice President Hatta to form a "strong" new cabinet. President Sukarno urged all parties to set aside prejudices and put national interests first.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Hatta is an active supporter of Sali's socialist ideas. His formation of a cabinet this time will be the most welcome figure by all parties in Yogyakarta. However, Mr. Hatta's economic views are generally known to be anti-Chinese.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 24th] After Indonesian President Hatta was ordered to form a cabinet, he was busy today holding meetings with leaders of various parties. Informed Indonesian sources believe that the number of seats in the new cabinet will be less than that of the previous cabinet, and the number of ministers will not exceed 20. If Hatta's cabinet formation is successful, he will give up the post of vice president, and the new cabinet may be announced on the evening of the 24th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 23rd] The resignation of the Indonesian Republican government on the 23rd will apparently cause the ceasefire negotiations between the United Nations in Indonesia and the Netherlands to be shattered in less than a week. Sjahrir's resignation occurred because of fierce attacks by Indonesian nationalists in the past week, accusing the government of succumbing to the Netherlands in the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<h3>Malang's Exiled Overseas Chinese Begin Repatriation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] According to reports from the interior of Java, 478 of our exiled refugees originally living in Malang, Dutch East Indies, were evacuated yesterday by the International Red Cross in the post office area, passing through 加多湾, preparing to be repatriated to their original place. These refugees were forced to withdraw to an area 80 kilometers east of Malang when the Dutch took "appeasement actions" to send troops there in July last year.</p>

<h3>Introduction to [The Memoirs of Cordell Hull]</h3>
<p>— Translated by our newspaper’s translation department</p>
<p>Our newspaper has decided to publish [The Memoirs of Cordell Hull] in daily installments, starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>This book has not yet been published or released in the United States. The [New York Times] will begin publishing it on the 26th of this month, in forty-two installments. The full text will not be published as a book before those forty-two days. The Editors Press Service, in New York, which is responsible for the publication of [The Memoirs of Cordell Hull], values our newspaper's long history and large readership in China, and has granted our newspaper the exclusive publication rights for Shanghai. The press service also repeatedly communicated back and forth via letters and telegrams regarding the precise date of publication. Initially, they decided that our newspaper should begin publication on the 26th, simultaneously with the [New York Times]. Later, they considered advancing the date to the 24th. Ultimately, they decided on the 26th. The press service was meticulously careful about the publication date, deliberating repeatedly, which demonstrates the importance they place on the manuscript. In fact, the publication date is the same, but Shanghai time is earlier than New York time, so our readers will see this magnificent work earlier than American readers. This is a small contribution of our newspaper, and also a piece of good fortune for our readers.</p>
<p>Cordell Hull was born in Tennessee in 1871. After leaving university in 1891, he practiced law in the state and served as a member of the Tennessee State Legislature. In 1907, he was elected to the House of Representatives, and in 1931, he moved to the Senate. His career in Congress spanned a full twenty-four years. In 1933, the late President Roosevelt invited him to serve as Secretary of State, undertaking the weighty responsibility of American foreign policy. His tenure as Secretary of State lasted for twelve years, longer than that of any other Secretary of State in American history. He retired in 1944 due to overwork and physical weakness. During his twelve years as Secretary of State, it was a period of great international tension. Mussolini was indulging in his dream of restoring the Roman Empire, Hitler was flexing his muscles and annexing neighboring countries in Central Europe, and Japanese imperialists, after seizing our Northeast, were still making constant military advances, inevitably leading to the outbreak of World War II. Fortunately, the Allied nations united to crush the invaders' ambitions and laid the initial foundation for post-war cooperation. As the US Secretary of State, Hull naturally had a thorough understanding of all these inside stories.</p>
<p>[The Memoirs of Cordell Hull] can be said to be the culmination of his political and diplomatic life. The full text is not rigidly divided into sections. For the most part, it narrates the important international events related to American diplomacy in chronological order, while incorporating his personal criticisms and emotions. He provides a subjective account of objective facts, making it lively in both content and style, as if imbuing dull historical facts with a vivid soul. The book contains very detailed accounts of the changes in America's attitude toward the European war, the course of Japanese-American negotiations, and the birth of the United Nations. However, it focuses on his personal activities, making it particularly vivid and showing clear likes and dislikes. As for the descriptions of his personal life, such as his relationship with President Roosevelt, his criticisms of government officials at the time, and his demeanor in dealing with diplomatic figures, they are especially frank, detailed, and engaging. The writing style is simple, but within the plainness there is passion and hidden strength, making it more interesting and more intimate than reading official history.</p>
<p>We feel that there are two points in this book that are most worthy of attention: First, Hull wrote it as a retired Secretary of State, which is quite different from the works written by politicians whose political careers have not yet ended. Ambitious politicians often like to embellish their past actions, sometimes even distorting the facts, but he does not need to. Young politicians, due to various considerations for their future careers or to avoid being misunderstood, cannot fully express what they want to say, but he can. With his past achievements and the age of seventy-five, he can explain the truth clearly and without any reservations. Second, although he was Roosevelt's Secretary of State, he was not merely the president's mouthpiece in the decision-making and implementation of American foreign policy. When he took office as Secretary of State, he told the President, "I do not want merely to convey messages from the President to foreign governments; I want to participate fully in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy." The President did indeed respect his opinions. In fact, his views on international affairs were so close to those of President Roosevelt that they often coincided. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that he was the actual planner and implementer of American foreign policy during the Roosevelt era. The content of the [Memoirs] provides invaluable information about the origins and evolution of American foreign policy during this era.</p>
<p>After reading the full text, we feel that Hull, as a diplomat, has several important characteristics: ① Hull is a diplomat who values international economic relations. During his tenure as a member of Congress, he was a well-known expert in tariffs and domestic tax laws. After taking office as Secretary of State, he regarded international tariff relations—that is, economic relations—as an important part of his foreign policy. He believed that "economic wars are the root cause of political wars, and the elimination of trade discrimination can reduce the possibility of war." In his first speech to Congress at the age of thirty-six, he advocated reducing tariff barriers and trade restrictions, but it was not until he was sixty-two that he finally succeeded in passing the Trade Agreements Act in Congress, after a arduous struggle lasting twenty-six years. However, in the following years, wars broke out in Africa, Asia, and Europe, so some may say, "Look, trade agreements did not prevent war." Hull replied, "Yes, although many trade agreements were signed, war still came. But the United States did not go to war with any country with which we were able to sign a trade agreement. This is a fact. With very few exceptions, all the countries with which we were able to sign trade agreements united to resist the Axis powers. This is also a fact. Political ties are based on economic ties." Who can deny that this insight is a great truth in international relations?</p>
<p>② Hull is a pragmatic diplomat. Throughout his life, he earnestly hoped that lasting peace could benefit the world and mankind, so he earned the nickname "Old Man of Peace," but he was by no means a blind "pacifist." In 1934, as the world situation became increasingly tense, he was the first to advocate strengthening America's self-defense capabilities. At that time, there were many who sang the praises of world peace or advocated that the United States implement a policy of isolation, but Hull recognized two points: First, Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese imperialists were unreasonable. World peace was not unnecessary but impossible. Paying lip service to peace would only enhance the arrogance of the aggressors and relax the self-defense efforts of the democratic countries. Second, the world is one, and peace is indivisible. Implementing a policy of isolation is tantamount to letting other countries fall into the clutches of the aggressors, and one would eventually become a victim of aggression oneself. Understanding this, he did his best to fight against hypocritical pacifists and short-sighted isolationists, advocating a realistic attitude to deal with the realistic international situation. He had a famous saying: "Our people should not be too proud to fight, but in certain conditions, they will not need to be too proud to fight." Nothing is more sincere and earnest than this saying.</p>
<p>③ Hull is an idealistic diplomat. During World War II, he was undoubtedly a warmonger, which was out of practical necessity. In fact, the reason why he advocated fighting the aggressors was to hope that lasting peace would eventually be realized. He, like President Roosevelt, was a great man with ideals and ambitions. He personally experienced two world wars and witnessed the tragedy of two massacres of human beings, deeply feeling that it was not enough to simply win this war; what was more important was to strive for lasting peace. He inherited President Roosevelt's will and added his own creative consciousness, planning a world organization. This is why Hull is called the "Father of the United Nations." He said: "The United Nations is not an alliance against other groups of countries, but an alliance against aggressors, not an alliance for war but an alliance for peace. But we should not expect the United Nations to create miracles. Its meaning is a product of human thought, not perfect. If this organization is to function effectively, it needs time, patience, and a spirit of international cooperation, especially the continued cooperation of the five major powers of the Soviet Union, Britain, China, France, and the United States..." Reading these words, one seems to hear the voice of an elder advising young people, full of enthusiasm and vividly on the page.</p>

<h3>Legislative Elections – Ballot Boxes Opened, Votes Counted: 130,000 Ballots Cast in District Elections; Starting Today, Time Will Be Advanced and Personnel Increased</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The legislative elections in this city began yesterday with the opening of ballot boxes and counting of votes at the City Council and the City Chamber of Commerce, respectively. The 126 ballot boxes for district elections had been concentrated at the City Council for safekeeping the night before. At 9:25 AM yesterday, Chairman Wu Guozhen arrived at the scene, followed by Zhang Xiaosong, Chen Baotai, and others. At 9:30 AM, the Mayor took the stage to announce the start of the vote count. The Director of the Vote Counting Center, Chen Minshu, then reported on the vote counting procedures and the criteria for invalid ballots. He stated: "To ensure impartiality, the Election Office has notified each candidate to send representatives to stay overnight at the venue to supervise the process. During the daytime vote counting, they are allowed to monitor from outside the venue, while only vote counting personnel and news reporters are allowed free access inside." The Mayor then left the scene, and the vote counting work commenced.</p>
<p>Yesterday's vote counting concluded at 6:30 PM. A total of 14 ballot boxes were opened, including two from the Tilanqiao District, two from the Zhenru District, one from the Wusong District, four from the Jing'an District, three from the Putuo District, one from the Luwan District, and one from the North Railway Station District. More than 130,000 ballots were counted. More than 60 staff members were divided into nine groups to carry out the work. The candidates who sent representatives to stay overnight to supervise were Xie Renzhao, Zheng Yuxiu, and Ma Junshuo. Xie Renjian had sent a representative to stay overnight the night before, while the representatives of the latter two arrived yesterday. The vote count and ranking of each candidate yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Xinheng: 25,111 votes</p>
<p>Zheng Yuxiu: 18,875 votes</p>
<p>Ma Junshuo: 18,458 votes</p>
<p>Cao Jun: 17,717 votes</p>
<p>Fang Zhichao: 14,181 votes</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing: 14,001 votes</p>
<p>Ma Shuli: 6,146 votes</p>
<p>Wang Jian'e: 5,814 votes</p>
<p>Xie Renzhao: 4,789 votes</p>
<p>Qian Jianqiu: 3,175 votes</p>
<p>Xia Sungui: 457 votes</p>
<p>Lu Mei: 434 votes</p>
<p>Zhu Wende: 84 votes</p>
<p>Zhou Yizhi: 65 votes</p>
<p>Zhao Zhimei: 59 votes</p>
<p>Ji Qiao: 32 votes</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Invalid Ballots; Some Voted for Huang Chao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were a total of 1,184 invalid ballots, most of which had circles drawn between the names of two candidates, making them difficult to identify. Others had circles drawn below the names of candidates, making it impossible to distinguish the voter's intention. In addition, in the third polling station of the Wusong District, two ballots nominated "Huang Chao" and included a ditty explaining the reasons for choosing Huang Chao, stating that Huang Chao was brave and could kill all the bad guys. In the ballot boxes of the Tilanqiao District, there was also a letter full of complaints, arguing that elections were meaningless and suggesting that the election campaign funds should be donated to winter relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Ji Qiao Declares Abandonment, But Did Not Complete Procedures with Election Headquarters</h3>
<p>Because the vote counting started late yesterday, the number of ballots counted was relatively small. Starting today, the vote counting will start earlier at 9:00 AM, and efforts will be made to increase manpower. Regarding the declaration of abandonment by Ji Qiao, the candidate from the Democratic Socialist Party, before the election, Director Zhang Xiaosong stated that Ji only published an advertisement in the newspaper and did not complete the procedures with the Election Headquarters. The City Election Office has not received any instructions from the headquarters. Therefore, legally, he should be treated the same as other candidates. Fortunately, after a candidate is elected, whether formally or as an alternate, the election office must formally inquire whether they are willing to be elected, at which time they can express their opinion.</p>
<h3>Senior Ship Officers' Elections – No Resolution Yet</h3>
<p>After the Nanjing Vocational Women's Election Office ordered that master mariners, marine engineers, radio operators, pilots, and other technicians who are senior ship officers be handled separately, a dispute arose over the return of ship officers' certificates to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau. After repeated persuasion by the bureau, the heads of the senior ship officers' groups tentatively collected more than 1,000 certificates for safekeeping. It is learned that the Maritime Affairs Bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation yesterday to report and request instructions. However, today many ship officers went to the bureau to return their certificates, and senior ship officers from various ships arriving in port today are asking their respective senior ship officers' groups to make the most effective protest to the Election Office.</p>
<h3>KMT Party Members and Cadres – Registration Extended by Three Days</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang (KMT) began re-registering party members and cadres, approximately 70,000 people have applied for registration. The original deadline was the 25th of this month. According to the personnel in charge of registration at the party headquarters, in order to avoid excluding a few party members and cadres, it has been decided to extend the deadline by three days, until the 28th of this month, at which time there will be no further extension.</p>

<h3>Professional Association Ballot Boxes – Industry, Commerce, Agriculture, and Education Opened First; Ballots Marked Below Names Unanimously Determined Valid</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The vote counting for the legislative elections of professional associations began at 10:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. Forty vote counting personnel, divided into five groups, were presided over by Director Chen Boliang. Fifteen supervisors appointed by the Election Office, including Wang Xianqing, were present to perform their supervisory duties. Mayor Wu arrived promptly after completing the opening ceremony at the City Council. A simple ceremony was held first, during which Chen Boliang read out the vote counting procedures and the standards for determining invalid ballots: ① Ballots not issued by the polling station; ② Ballots without any markings; ③ Ballots with markings for two or more candidates; ④ Ballots with markings not above the surname; ⑤ Ballots with other words written on them; ⑥ Ballots with markings that have been altered. Mayor Wu then raised the fourth standard, stating: The vote counting center for district elections believes that many ballots have names circled, or circled below the name. Because it does not conform to the regulation, if those are all deemed invalid, it seems that the voters' intention is being erased. They have unanimously decided that ballots such as those should also be deemed valid. The Mayor specifically raised this point to solicit the opinions of everyone. After it was approved, it will be handled the same as in the district vote. Mayor Wu then used a key to open the second ballot box of the labor union. After the ceremony was completed, the vote counting was declared to have begun. Of the 47 ballot boxes, the labor union, commerce association, farmers' association, and education association were opened first. Among them, the two ballot boxes of the education association have been fully opened and tallied, while only five of the labor union's nineteen ballot boxes have been opened, only two of the farmers' association's four ballot boxes have been opened, and only three of the commerce association's six ballot boxes have been opened. In addition to continuing to open the above incomplete ballot boxes today, the professional associations will also begin to open their ballot boxes.</p>
<h3>Education Association – Tradition First</h3>
<p>The number of votes obtained by each association candidate yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Education Association: Tradition First, 55,341 votes; Cao Chu, 11,851 votes; Ye Suchong, 4,957 votes; Ye Hua (female), 3,011 votes; Wu Zonghan, 2,750 votes. 14 invalid ballots.</p>
<p>Labor Union: Lu Jingshi, 135,221 votes; Ling Yingzhen, 298 votes; Wang Yisheng, 8 votes; Sun Jingui, 9 votes; Sun Xiangfeng, 2 votes. 116 invalid ballots.</p>
<p>Commerce Association: Luo Qinghua, 65,385 votes; Pan Shihao, 25,420 votes; Chen Dayu, 2,001 votes; Lü Cang, 1,546 votes; Zhu Huiqing, 1,504 votes. 37 invalid ballots.</p>
<p>Farmers’ Association: Li Qing, 10,191 votes; Zhang Jingqing, 4,390 votes; Chen Shilian, 87 votes; Sun Jixu, 8 votes; Wu Wangji, 1 vote; Ban Xiyu, 1 vote. 453 invalid ballots.</p>
<h3>Dance Industry Holds Symposium, Decides to Send Representatives Again to Request Postponement</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Dance Hall Association held a symposium at its premises at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss their own problems after the dance ban. More than 50 people attended the symposium, including representatives from the Dance Hall Association, the Dance Industry Workers' Union, the Dancers' Association, the Musicians' Association, and the Women's Association. It was decided: ① To hold a charity sale in dance halls and nightclubs throughout the city on the 28th of this month, with the proceeds used as a welfare fund for dance hall industry colleagues. ② To convene a conference at New Sennin on the 31st of this month to discuss requesting the authorities to extend the deadline by drawing lots, and representatives from the City Council and other circles will be invited to attend. ③ To nominate Sun Hongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and five others as representatives to petition in Beijing again on a regular basis, demanding the withdrawal of the order.</p>
<h3>Conscription Conference Postponed Due to Director Xu's Absence</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The city's conscription conference, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed to the 30th of this month because Xu Siping, Director of the Conscription Department of the Ministry of National Defense, has not yet arrived in Shanghai. Yao Wenyin, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau, said: "Director Xu is currently inspecting conscription in Hunan and Hubei. If Xu is unable to come to Shanghai by then, it will have to be postponed to the beginning of next month. The method of conscription, the date of conscription, and the method of fundraising in the city this year must all be discussed and decided after Xu arrives in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>End-of-Year Bonus for Clothing Industry Workers – Principles to be Decided Through Consultation</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The request for end-of-year bonuses from vocational workers in the Western clothing, leather shoe, and fashion industries was transferred to the Labor-Management Arbitration Council by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The small group of the Arbitration Council discussed it yesterday. Because the capital side believed there was no precedent, and the labor side insisted on the bonus payment, to avoid the expansion of disputes, it was decided that the General Labor Union and the Chamber of Commerce would separately persuade both labor and capital sides. The capital side would give the workers a sum of money under another name, and it would not be called the end-of-year bonus. The principle is still pending approval by Director Wu and needs to be further discussed in detail.</p>
<h3>Intention to Frame People – Two Foremen Indicted</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Huang Bosen and Lu Chunchi, foremen at the Xinzha Bridge West Rice Wharf, were prosecuted by the District Procuratorate yesterday for false accusation. According to the indictment, the workers Shen Baoshan, Chen Ruhong, Sun Lianchi, Cheng Xilai, Zhang Chenghong, and others contacted workers to hold a meeting, intending to audit Huang Bosen's accounts. Huang, in order to preempt them, colluded with Lu Chunchi as a witness to falsely accuse Shen and the other four of being suspected of being members of a different party and secretly reported them to a certain unit of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense stationed in Shanghai. The unit issued an order to the Shanghai Police Department to investigate. On December 24 last year, Huang and Lu, together with police officers, secretly brought a large number of reactionary slogans and leaflets that had been prepared in advance and placed them in the residences of Shen and others, using this as an excuse to arrest Shen and the other four. After investigation, the police bureau found that Huang and Lu were suspected of false accusation and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 28 and Article 169, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<h3>Flying Trade Show – Displaying Tire and Parts Samples on a Plane – Flying to the Far East for Exhibition</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] An "Atlas Flying Trade Show" will arrive at the city's Longhua Airport on the 27th of this month. The trade show is set up on a Douglas DC4 aircraft and is a new American invention used for advertising. The plane displays samples of the latest tires, automobile parts, and aircraft parts produced by the "Atlas Company" for exhibition throughout the Far East to promote them. After arriving in Shanghai, it will host visits from all walks of life, and the person in charge of the company and the cooperative Mobil Oil Company will jointly host the reception and explanations. It is planned to stay in Shanghai for five days, fly to Beijing on March 1 and stay for one day, and then go to Peiping and stay for two days. A total of sixteen people are traveling on the same plane, including Bedford, president of the Atlas Company and director of Mobil Oil Company, Vice President Padeheimer, and seven other department heads and managers, three Mobil Oil Company representatives, and six pilots, radio operators, and mechanics.</p>
<h3>Corruption Case of Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) Staff - First Trial of Eight Defendants - Hou Aichang Testifies on Reasons for Stopping Fan Distribution - Claimed They Were Intended for Use by CNRRA's Health Department</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the corruption case of senior CNRRA officials, Hou Aichang and twelve others were previously indicted by the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the District Court's Criminal Division held its first public trial, presided over by Judge Huang Guang in Criminal Court One. The defendants present were Hou Aichang, Director of the CNRRA Office and General Manager of the Finance Department's Materials Purchasing and Sales Office; Dong Chengdao, Director of the Finance Department; Hu Keshi, former Director of the General Affairs Department and Director of Fisheries Management; Tao Jingyuan, Chief of the Finance Department's Document Section; Jiang Renlin, former Chief of the General Affairs Department's Welfare Section; Pang Yuanlong; Deputy Chief Auditor Du Cen; and Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Anle Textile Factory. Wu Zhiwei, Hou Aichang's brother-in-law, was present, and many family members of the defendants were in court to observe. After roll call, the court announced individual questioning.</p>
<p>Changing Yarn Standards Due to Storage Difficulties</p>
<p>Hou Aichang testified first: The electric fans allocated to CNRRA by UNRRA were unsuitable for relief purposes, so they were publicly auctioned. Zheng Yi Trading Company won the bid for some at 356,000 yuan per fan. Subsequent auctions failed to attract any bids, so they were sold publicly in the retail department. He could not remember how many were sold through the retail department. The reason for stopping sales in June was to inventory the stock. At that time, over 500 official letters requesting fan allocation were received from various agencies. Because he intended to reserve 2,000 fans for use by CNRRA's Health Department, he issued a hand-written instruction to the Document Section to ignore all requests to avoid trouble. He also couldn't remember how many fans were left when sales stopped. As for the original standard for exchanging American cotton for yarn, it was 670 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. However, CNRRA exchanged 760 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. Although Mr. Kahn, Director of the Cotton Yarn Department of UNRRA's China Office, initially objected at a meeting, he raised no further objections after explanation. This was because cotton storage was separate from insurance, not an excuse.</p>
<p>Yuyuan Road House - Not a Gift</p>
<p>The companies allocated cotton yarn were selected from a list of over 20 provided by the Import and Export Management Committee. Contracts were based on this list. Anle Textile Factory received a disproportionately large allocation of wool, but no kickbacks were received. The house at 396 Yuyuan Road was not a gift from Deng Zhonghe. Wu Zhiwei rented the house from Deng and sublet it to me for a fixed term of two years at a rent of US$720, paid in advance. Wu's letter to Deng proves this.</p>
<p>Dong Chengdao was then questioned and testified: The allocation of electric fans was not within my area of responsibility, and I am unclear about the situation. I also do not know whether Deng Zhonghe gave Hou Aichang a house.</p>
<p>Document Section Chief Tao Jingyuan testified: The allocation of electric fans was done under orders. The reason for not responding to requests from various agencies was due to Director-General Hou's instructions to reject all applications.</p>
<p>Exclusive Allocation - Reasons for Wool</p>
<p>Deng Zhonghe testified: The house on Yuyuan Road was rented to Wu Zhiwei, who then sublet it to Hou. Wu's letter proves this. As for why my factory received a disproportionately large allocation of wool, many factories were unwilling to purchase it at the time, and others often issued bad checks. However, my factory purchased large quantities and never bounced a check. Jiang Renlin testified: During my tenure as Chief of the Welfare Section, I used 5 million yuan from the contingency fund, but this was for the renovation of the CNRRA Ruifeng Lane dormitory and was used for public purposes, not for personal embezzlement. All expenditures were supported by invoices, but there was no public bidding, so the procedures were slightly deficient.</p>
<p>Du Cen testified: The Deputy Chief Auditor reviews all accounts on behalf of the Chief Auditor. The purchase of furniture from Jin Changxiang and Hua Chang Company by Specialist Chen Timin was not reviewed in advance, and the procedures were indeed incomplete. However, this was approved by a certain auditor, and I only learned about it later.</p>
<p>Furniture Purchase - Flawed Procedures</p>
<p>Hu Keshi testified: The purchase of furniture was not audited in advance, which was slightly flawed, but because the furniture was purchased in small quantities, it was finally submitted to the audit office for review in aggregate. This was a practical difficulty.</p>
<p>Pang Yuanlong testified: The refrigerator in the Ruifeng Lane dormitory was purchased by my father, but I cannot provide proof.</p>
<p>Witness Wu Zhiwei stated: I rented the house on Yuyuan Road from Deng and sublet it to Hou. I gave Deng a letter informing him of the details.</p>
<p>The questioning ended after 6:00 PM. The court ordered Du Cen and Jiang Renlin to each provide two shop guarantors. The remaining defendants were released on their original bail, and the trial was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Six Engineering Societies Hold Joint Social Gathering - Opera Performances by Amateur Singers Add to the Merriment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Last night, the Shanghai branches of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Chinese Society of Automotive Engineers, the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society, the Chinese Municipal Engineering Society, the Chinese Society of Power Engineers, and the Chinese Institute of Engineers held a joint social gathering in the grand hall on the third floor of the Yiyuan Hotel on Fuxing West Road. The entertainment program began around 7:00 PM and included alternating social dances, piano solos, and soprano solos. There were also Peking opera performances by amateur singers, including Ms. Jiang Jiaohongying's "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest," Wang Zhunchen's "Dingjun Mountain," Ms. Wang Huiheng's "Spring Boudoir Dream," and Wei Shanghou's "Catching and Releasing Suqin." Famous amateur opera singers Ni Qiuping and Wang Ruoqi played the strings. The gathering concluded in high spirits around 11:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Joint Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi Demands Allocation of Reparations Materials - Decides to Add Representatives to Petition the Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai office of the Joint Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guangxi and the former China Central and Southern Region Industrial Association held their third temporary joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Representatives from the Restoration Committee of Privately-Owned Yarn Factories Relocated to the Rear Areas also attended. More than 100 people were present, chaired by Hu Juewen, to discuss a unified opinion on the handling of Japanese reparations materials for factories relocated during the war, in order to continue to argue with the government based on reason.</p>
<p>The chairman first reported on the progress of handling the case, followed by a discussion of the reparations issue. The representatives spoke enthusiastically, and the consensus was that the government should allocate a portion of the Japanese reparations materials for privately-owned factories that suffered losses due to relocation during the war, as a form of compensation without requiring payment. However, they would not give up the right to apply for allocation at a price but would request preferential treatment. The preferential conditions included requesting exemption from pricing in US dollars and extending the installment payment period to five years. It was also decided that in addition to the original 19 representatives including Hu Juewen, 12 more representatives would be added: Li Zushen, Ding Ximeng, Zhu Xianfang, Xie Tiansha, Xia Shuyu, Wan Fa, He Fangliang, Chen Tianhe, Zeng Haoshan, Xiao Boshiu, Xiang Yitao, and Liu Zhensheng. They would be responsible for continuing to petition the government. A delegation would be formed to petition the relevant authorities in both Nanjing and Shanghai, write to the Chairman, and send telegrams to various regions to seek sympathy from all sectors of society. Regarding the government's announced "Revised Measures for Priority Leasing and Purchase of Enemy and Puppet Factories by Factories Restoring Operations in the Rear Areas," the conference decided to continue participating in leasing and purchasing, but to strive for improvements in certain unreasonable regulations. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>"Da Zhonghua" Ship Encounters Danger - Strong Winds and Heavy Snow - Runs Aground in Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, strong northeasterly winds and heavy snowfall have made navigation difficult, causing serious impact on ships. The coastal radio station received a distress telegram from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Da Zhonghua" ship around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, stating that it had "run aground on M蹄礁 (Ma Ti Jiao) near Qingdao, the engine room is flooded, urgently awaiting rescue."</p>
<p>It is reported that the ship weighs 4,900 tons and had recently transported coal from Qinhuangdao to Qingdao. It was preparing to load cargo in Qingdao to transport to Shanghai when it was blown onto the reef by a storm while berthed in the port. Due to the severe wind and snow at sea, rescue ships were unable to approach.</p>
<p>[Another Report] China Merchants Bureau's "Jiang Ya" liner on the Shanghai-Ningbo route is delayed in Ningbo due to the storm and will return to Shanghai when the weather improves. Furthermore, a steel barge owned by Xingzhong Company, towed by the "Xingmin" tugboat, sailed from Shanghai to Hankou on the morning of the 22nd of this month. Near Baimao, the river was hit by torrential winds and waves, causing it to lose control. The "Xingmin" tugboat ran aground and the hull flooded, while the steel barge drifted with the current. After the tugboat sent out a distress signal, the China Merchants Bureau's "Hai Wan" ship, en route from Wuhu, happened to pass by and received the distress signal. It approached the smaller ship and rescued all six crew members, bringing them to Shanghai yesterday. Xingzhong Company received the report and requested that China Merchants Bureau dispatch a ship for rescue. The Bureau's Maritime Affairs Department has assigned "Min 313" to sail to the scene of the accident near Baimao this morning to attempt towing and search for the steel barge.</p>

<h3>Treasonous Jewelry - Invaluable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Among the properties confiscated by the authorities from major and minor traitors after the victory, there is a category of precious jewelry, including diamonds, jadeite, jade bracelets, watches, brooches, gold ingots, gold Longevity Stars, gold Magu, etc., totaling 2,772 pieces, with a wide variety of items, a magnificent sight. Among them, the largest diamond weighs 30 carats. It is said to belong to the Qianye Family. The decorations seized from the home of the traitor Youjia are the most numerous. The value of these valuables is very high. According to the initial estimate by the Military Intelligence Bureau, which received them, they are worth over 9,600 taels of gold.</p>
<p>All of these jewelry items are currently stored in safe deposit boxes at the Bank of China. The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office is having a big headache dealing with their disposal. If an auction is adopted, people must be allowed to view the samples. However, the jewelry is small in size but of great value. If there is any negligence and theft or substitution occurs, no one on the staff dares to take responsibility. Therefore, the office recently plans to use the method of entrusting the Central Savings Society to issue lottery tickets. The principle is already being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, since the types and values of the jewelry vary, even if this method is implemented in the future, there may still be some twists and turns. Since the news of issuing lottery tickets spread, many outsiders have become interested in this matter. Some people from other cities have even remitted money in advance to make reservations, which is quite difficult for the person in charge of the office to handle.</p>
<p>Largest Diamond Weighs 30 Carats - Planned to be Auctioned by Issuing Lottery Tickets</p>
<h3>A Major Bloody Incident Caused by Professional Jealousy - Glass Merchant Intentionally Retaliates - Two Guns Fired, Three Injured</h3>
<p>Coffin Purchased in Advance and Grave Prepared</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Chunsheng, also known as Chen Mapi, 30 years old, from Nanjing, who runs Tai Glass Company at 47 Lane 8, Fujian Middle Road, has been making a profit in his business due to his smooth dealings. Unexpectedly, in February last year, Cheng Quanlin, 34 years old, from Changzhou, suddenly established Taichangxiang Glass Company at 2 Lane, which led to a decline in Chen's business. Chen held a grudge and once led a group to Cheng's company, attempting to destroy it, which resulted in punishment and compensation.</p>
<p>Chen's resentment deepened. Yesterday morning at approximately 8:15 AM, Chen, dressed in a Zhongshan suit and carrying a handgun, went to Cheng's residence and knocked on the door. Cheng's relative, Cheng Houdi, opened the door and asked for his intention. Chen falsely claimed to be repaying a debt and went straight to the second floor, barging into the parlor. At this time, Cheng Quanlin had already heard footsteps and opened the door, inviting him in and asking where he came from. Chen immediately replied that he was from Hongkou. Shortly after, two gunshots rang out in the room. One bullet hit Cheng's left waist, and he fell to the ground. Cheng's wife, Wang Heying (from Changzhou), was full-term pregnant at the time and was sitting on the edge of the bed, dressing her three-year-old daughter, Pei Di. Chen fired another shot, hitting the girl's left arm and piercing her mother's abdomen. Both mother and daughter were injured and immediately fell to the ground. Although Cheng was shot, he remained conscious and struggled to get up, intending to pursue the assailant. At the same time, his cousin, Yin Hegui, who lived in the attic, heard two gunshots and saw someone holding a gun, running onto the balcony. She shouted loudly and ran to the parlor to check, where she saw Cheng Quanlin and others lying in pools of blood. She immediately turned around and went downstairs. At this time, Chen had already jumped down, breaking his head and crouching on the ground. Fortunately, Police Chief Zhu Desheng of Precinct 1186 nearby, along with police officer No. 3273, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and arrested Chen. They also summoned ambulances to send the injured to Renji, Gongji, and Police Hospitals for treatment. Afterwards, Lao Zha Police Bureau Chief Shi ordered Section Chief Jiang to supervise officers Tang Zhihao, Chen Jun'gan, Li Junkun, and Xia Yongzhi to rush to investigate. They seized an automatic pistol and several bullets and found a receipt in Chen's company showing that he had purchased a coffin worth 20 million yuan from the Anshoucai Section of the Pingjiang Public Office in November. He had also purchased a burial plot from the Buddhist First Cemetery, drawn his own plans, made porcelain portraits, and written "The Tomb of Mr. Chen Chunsheng" on yellow paper, along with charcoal ash, lime, and porterage fees. It is clear that he had planned to kill Cheng for a long time. It is reported that the gun he used was purchased from a person named Shi from Fang. Officers were dispatched to Shi's residence, but he had already left for Changsha. Cheng's wife, Wang Heying, was sent to Renji Hospital for surgery. After removing 10 bullets, her condition remained critical until midnight.</p>

<h3>Committee for Review of Occupied Civilian Land Established - First Meeting Yesterday - Approved Review Guidelines and Divided Proposals for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The founding meeting and first meeting of the Executive Yuan's Central Agencies Using Enemy-Occupied Civilian Land Review Committee in Shanghai was held at the City Hall conference room yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Those in attendance included Chairman Wu Guozhen, Deputy Chairman Zhu Ping, Shen Zonglian and Zhang Shi from the City Government, Zhang Shuzeng from the Ministry of National Defense, Dan Yinsun from the Ministry of Education, Ouyang Lun from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ma Lianfang from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Xia Xianjiang from the Resources Commission, Ge Jieshen from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Ma Shaoquan, Chen Shukun, Xu Xiajun, and Sun Yujun from the Shanghai Real Estate Association, Xie Haoling from Zhongju Xin, and Xiang Changquan from the Shanghai City Council, totaling 30 people. Mayor Wu, representing the Executive Yuan, delivered a speech stating that the central agencies using enemy-occupied civilian land in Shanghai has been a long-standing issue without a thorough solution, which is of great concern. Therefore, this review committee was specifically established to accelerate the clearing within a limited period of three months. If requisition is necessary, it will be requisitioned at a discounted price; otherwise, it will be returned immediately.</p>
<p>Deputy Chairman Zhu Ping then reported that during the period of enemy occupation, the Enemy Property Company originally planned to earmark and requisition civilian land, and enemy and puppet military agencies forcibly occupied civilian land, totaling approximately 100,400 mu. Among them, 7,200 mu had been issued land prices. After the recovery, it was handled by the Enemy and Puppet Property Office. The central government attaches great importance to this matter and has specifically established this committee, instructing the local government to clear it within a limited time. During this period, the Land Administration Bureau sent personnel to investigate and collect data. According to the investigation, the civilian land received and used by various agencies is approximately 59,000 mu. A total of 2,035 cases of people applying for the return of land have been received and urgently need to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Three Groups to Review Separately</p>
<p>The meeting then discussed and approved the amendment to the Enemy and Puppet Land Use Regulations and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for filing. The proposals were divided into three groups for review to expedite the process. The first group will review cases involving the use of civilian land for military and transportation projects. The list is as follows: Ma Shaoquan (Convener), Zhang Shuhui, Xie Haoling, Zhang Shi, Zhang Xuelian, Xu Xiajun, plus one representative from the Ministry of Communications and one representative from the Lawyers Association. The second group will review cases involving the use of civilian land for educational, academic, cultural, and charitable projects. The list is as follows: Ge Jieshen (Convener), Chen Shukun, Dan Yinsun, Ma Lianfang, Wang Weiyuan, Sun Yujun, plus one representative from the Lawyers Association. The third group will review cases involving the use of civilian land for state-owned enterprises. The list is as follows: Xiang Changquan (Convener), Ouyang Lun, Ma Lianfang, Xia Xianjiang, Shen Naizheng, Yang Shukang, plus one representative from the Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>Two Temporary Motions</p>
<p>Subsequently, two temporary motions were passed: The standard for paying for land forcibly requisitioned by the enemy and puppets should be formulated in accordance with the actual situation, and Zhu Ping (Convener), Xie Haoling, and Ma Shaoquan were nominated as members to be responsible for drafting and submitting it to the next general meeting for discussion. It was resolved that all central agencies in Shanghai using enemy-occupied civilian land should submit a clear list and use plan within one month for review. If the deadline is exceeded, it will be regarded as unnecessary to use and will be returned immediately.</p>
<h3>Protecting Child Labor and Apprentices - Deciding to First Investigate Treatment Conditions - To Serve as the Basis for Formulating General Rules</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau previously drafted general rules for apprentice service to improve the treatment of child labor and submitted them to the City Government for approval. The City Government forwarded it to the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee for review. The Adjudication Committee convened a small group meeting yesterday morning to discuss it. Those in attendance included Zhang Yongqin, Tian Heqing, Liang Yongzhang, Liu Jingji, Fan Zhenbang, and Zhou Xuexiang. It was decided that before formulating these general rules, the Social Affairs Bureau should, together with various agencies, conduct a practical investigation of the treatment and learning conditions of apprentices and child laborers in general factories and shops, to serve as a basis for reference during formulation. To curb the abuse of child labor and unreasonable treatment, the small group decided that the competent authorities should issue an order to various industry associations, instructing their member factories, companies, and shops to pay attention to several points: Apprentices must have eight hours of sleep and adequate rest time. Monthly wages shall not be less than three yuan, calculated according to the cost-of-living index. After the three-year apprenticeship period expires, the learning period shall not be extended on any pretext. The above points will be submitted to the City Government after approval by the general meeting.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Capital Standard Raised to 50,000 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Interior believes that the amount of capital to be stated in the registration application when a newspaper is published, as stipulated in Article 6 of the Implementing Rules of the Publication Law, is based on the standard of 1937, which is now difficult to apply. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions to increase the original amount by 50,000 times. In addition, the publication of magazines shall also refer to half of the newspaper capital amount in each region as stipulated in Article 8 to unify the standards. After receiving the above instructions, the City Government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to comply.</p>

<h3>Theft of Calligraphy and Painting Dispute at Former Vice President Tan's Residence in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At the residence of former Vice President Tan at 1 Lane 11, Tai'an Road, several valuable calligraphy and paintings and two seals used by Tan during his lifetime were recently stolen. After Tan's eldest daughter, Tan Rui, discovered this, she believed that Wei Zhongbao, the son of the male servant Wei Shurong, was highly suspected and pursued him. However, she was insulted by Wei, so she reported to the Detective Section of the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation. Section Chief Chen Xianrong sent officers to investigate and found two of Tan's seals, five scrolls of calligraphy and painting, three pieces of clothing, one blue and one white piece of silk, and one mat in Wei's residence at 219 Fuxing West Road. Tan's daughter identified them as correct, so Wei's son was brought to the bureau. However, Wei's father claimed that the above-mentioned relics were actually gifts given to him by Tan during his lifetime and have been collected for many years, so there was no theft. After hearing the statement, the police bureau released him on bail after slightly reprimanding his son for insulting the master.</p>

<h3>The Shen Gongwei Scandal: His Wife Unwilling to Withdraw the Lawsuit; Li Zhen Testifies About How They Met</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Li Zhen, a red-hot dancing girl known as "Yang Nannan," is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office for her entanglement in a romantic scandal with Shen Gongwei. Previously, Prosecutor Li had her released on bail of 2,000 yuan in cash, while Shen was detained. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, District Prosecutor Fang Zheng summoned Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, and Li Zhen for questioning. Mao arrived wearing a yellow floral fur coat, a blue scarf, and black high-heeled leather shoes. The prosecutor first questioned Mao Xiuzhen, who stated, "I am 24 years old, from Hubei. I married Shen in 1945 and now have two children, a son and a daughter. Shen usually doesn't have a proper job and spends his time wandering around. Our relationship was good after we married, but it gradually deteriorated after he met Li Zhen. Shen usually got money from me, but later he took many of my jewelry pieces to spend. On the night of the 19th, Shen came home and threatened me with a handgun, saying he would kill me. I left to avoid his violence. When I returned home on the 20th, the maid told me that the young master was at home, sleeping with a dancing girl in the bedroom. I reported this to the police station, and the officers knocked on the door. Shen only opened it after fifteen minutes. The handgun was on the table. I helped Li put on her underwear and had both of them arrested by the police. Now I want to sue Shen and Li for adultery and am unwilling to withdraw the lawsuit." Li Zhen testified, "I am 23 years old and work as a dancing girl. I first met Shen in 1946 at the New Xianlin Dance Hall, introduced by Miss Mao's younger brother. We became intimate five months later. Shen and I did not live together; the house is my own. Shen usually just eats at my house, and sometimes we go out together, with me paying for everything. The rumor that I am supporting Shen is not true. On the night of the 19th, Shen got me drunk and took me to his house. Shen took off my coat, but not my underwear. Shen once told me that Miss Mao was like a sister to him and that he would marry me in the future. People from Shen's family often came to my house to hang out." At this point, the court noted that because the plaintiff, Mao Xiuzhen, was unwilling to withdraw the lawsuit, the case still required further investigation and adjourned it to a later date. Both Mao and Li were dismissed. Shen Gongwei was not interrogated yesterday.</p>

<h3>Developing the Shengsi Islands: Director Dong Zanyao Talks to Our Reporter About the New and Old Fishing Industries</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Zhenjiang, 23rd] The Shengsi Islands are not only the only fishing area in Jiangsu Province but also one of the four major fishing grounds in the country. Located on the front line of national defense in the East China Sea, they are also important militarily. Before the war, the amount of fish caught each year was worth more than 20 million yuan. With the application of new fishing methods, the yield would be even more considerable. The islands originally belonged to the fifth district of Chongming. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing the importance of the area, specially established a new governing bureau this morning to actively develop the islands. It also organized the Shengsi Construction Committee to actively promote development. Last week, Director Dong Zanxiao of the Construction Department, along with Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, jointly inspected the islands, spending half a month there before returning to the province yesterday. Director Dong told our reporter that the islands have a population of about 24,000 people during normal times, which increases to more than 100,000 during the fishing season. There are currently more than 3,800 fishing boats and dozens of fishing vessels, which were previously controlled by unscrupulous fishing bosses. Since the provincial government ordered their arrest, these bosses have disappeared. However, last year suffered an unprecedented typhoon, and the production of hairtail during the spring season alone dropped sharply from 300,000 catties to 50,000 catties, resulting in severe losses that greatly impacted the lives of fishermen. The following projects are currently under active development:</p>
<p>Salt Problem: An agreement has been reached with the Salt Bureau to establish two salt warehouses on the islands, with a regular salt storage capacity of 4,000 dan.</p>
<p>Fishing Loan Problem: Most fishermen on the islands have no savings and are exploited by high-interest loans, leading to extreme economic hardship. This is a major obstacle to the revival of the fishing industry. A survey of fishing capital is underway, and the China Farmers Bank is being asked to provide low-interest fishing loans.</p>
<p>Food Supply Problem: The islands are a fishing area and do not produce rice. There is a constant shortage of food. Efforts are being made to apply for and transport rice permits to facilitate the purchase and transport of rice.</p>
<p>Transportation Problem: The islands are isolated overseas, making transportation inconvenient. For example, mail must be sent via Daishan, Zhejiang, taking more than ten days to arrive. In the future, it is planned to allocate transportation vessels to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>Fishing Port Problem: The construction of Shengshan Fishing Port is extremely urgent. Although the terrain is relatively good, there is often a risk of not being able to take shelter in time when there are changes in weather conditions. Moreover, during the fishing season, fishing boats from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces gather there. If a fishing port could be built there, natural disasters could be avoided. However, the project is large and cannot be completed in a short time. The first step is to detonate the three reefs in the main waterway to reduce the danger.</p>
<p>Drinking Water Problem: This is, of course, a major problem for the islanders. It is planned to build more reservoirs wherever possible and to find ways to dig wells to solve the residents' drinking water problem.</p>
<p>Afforestation Problem: There are very few trees on the islands, and the mountains are barren. A campaign to promote afforestation is underway to make the barren islands green. Other initiatives, such as promoting fishing village side industries like weaving nets and shipbuilding, are also included in the development plan. In the future, there will be more urgent problems to solve, such as the</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Improvement Problem: In the process of transitioning from old-style fishing boats to new-style fishing vessels, what kind of fishing boat should be built that is the most practical, popular, and productive tool for fishermen? This is a big problem that must be studied. Currently, fishermen can only fish inshore because their boats are too small. They cannot cook on the boats and must row close to the schools of fish, exhausting themselves. Although they can muster the strength to fish, they must still row the boat back, consuming much of their energy on the journey. Therefore, they can only exert minimal effort on fishing. They are rarely able to return alive if they encounter</p>
<p>Storms: Therefore, they cannot go fishing in the deep sea, and they have to sit and wait for fish near the shore, where there are not many fish to catch. Fishermen are idle for half the year, not because they cannot produce, but because there is an urgent need for technical improvements. During my visit to Shengsi, I personally visited various nearby islands and spoke in detail with old fishermen. Currently, the most suitable and needed tool, according to most opinions, is to increase the size of the old-style back-carrying sampans (which are large fishing boats that can carry two smaller sampans). Each boat would be about thirty tons, equipped with a fifty-horsepower engine, and carry four sampans. Two boats would form a pair, used as</p>
<p>Mother Ships: Each day, they could also tow many smaller boats to fish in deeper waters. In addition to the smaller boats and sampans each fishing on their own, a pair of mother ships could be used like Japanese-style hand-operated net fishing vessels. If there are schools of fish or storms, the mother ships can send signals to help them move or take shelter. They are also equipped with weapons for protection. When returning, the mother ships would tow them back. In this way, each time they could catch three or four hundred dan of fish, and the working fishermen could reach more than fifty people. One pair of boats can solve the livelihood of more than fifty families, and they can produce eight or nine hundred million yuan per day, which is more convenient than new-style</p>
<p>Fishing Vessels: New-style fishing vessels can go out to sea for fishing only twice a month at most. Each time, they usually catch only more than 20,000 catties, or at most more than 40,000 catties, but the cost is very high, which does not benefit the fishermen and cannot be considered relief. Director Dong is now inviting fishing and shipbuilding experts to start trial-producing two pairs, aiming to improve from old-style fishing to new-style fishing and provide genuine relief for coastal fishermen. At the same time, he has obtained the support of Director Zhao of the Fisheries Administration, who will mass-produce them in the future to reduce the difficulties faced by fishermen.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Launches Winter Clothing Drive: One Garment per Household</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Zhenjiang, 24th] The Security and Political Department of Jiangsu Province has launched a winter clothing donation drive and will invite township chiefs on the 28th to assist in door-to-door fundraising to achieve the goal of "one garment per household." The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the current period of suppression, has sent a special telegram to the municipal and county governments, instructing them to no longer use refreshments when receiving guests and convening meetings in order to save money. The Second Inspection Bureau of the Provincial Police Department will conduct a general household survey starting on the 25th. Those without national identity cards will be subject to administrative punishment. The Provincial Government has received an order from the Executive Yuan stating that the sharp fluctuations in food prices and the obstruction of food sources are the main reasons. Local governments and military and police units should provide effective assistance to grain merchants transporting and selling grain, as long as they comply with the regulations of the Food Control Law, and should not block them for any reason. After receiving the order, the Provincial Government has instructed the special commissioners and county chiefs to strictly comply. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Provisional Assembly has resolved: (1) to suggest that the central government strengthen the training of new recruits and improve their living conditions in order to increase the people's interest in serving in the military; (2) to request the Provincial Government to postpone the collection of food business tax.</p>

<h3>Good News for Sugarcane Farmers in Taiwan Sugar Producing Areas: Mobile Bank Cars Begin Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Taipei, 22nd by Ship] On the afternoon of the 20th, our reporter visited the row of mobile bank cars, a new and unique facility established by the Industrial and Commercial Bank. According to Huang Chaoqin, chairman of the bank, the mobile bank mainly goes deep into the sugarcane farming areas in central and southern Taiwan to solve the problem of issuing sugar payments for the sugar companies' factories. At the same time, it also serves the sugarcane farmers, and expands the bank's storage business, and increases the bank's deposits.</p>
<p>With the rise of inflation, an ordinary sugarcane farmer can receive more than a million in cash during the sugar-making season, and more than several hundred million in some cases. According to the sugar distribution method of the sugar company, if one hundred catties of sugarcane can produce ten catties of sugar, the sugarcane farmer can get five catties, of which 20% can be taken in kind, and 80% can be taken in cash. This cash is 4,000 yuan paid in advance by the company for every thousand catties of sugarcane, which needs to be paid off from December 10th to the end of April. The Industrial and Commercial Bank undertakes the lending business for 14 sugar factories, with a total amount of more than 20 billion, possibly reaching 30 billion. If the Huye Sugar Factory has 3 billion in loans, and each time 3,000 sugarcane farmers are paid, this considerable amount would be difficult for all parties if the bank could not directly handle the deposits and withdrawals on the spot. Therefore, the bank has specially prepared mobile cars, and uses a well-developed highway network to go deep into the sugarcane farming areas. A general agency was established in Tainan, and branch agencies were established in Huwei, Chiayi, and Pingtung. The mobile cars take turns disbursing funds in the designated dates and areas.</p>
<p>The bank has specially trained staff and temporary cashiers in important rural areas for two months. When each car (each car has two staff members, one manager, 16 to 20 temporary staff members, and the driver also works) goes deep into the sugarcane areas, they use the vehicles to distribute funds on the spot, and also conduct publicity, lectures, and visits.</p>
<p>Taiwanese people have a good habit of depositing money, but based on their initial operations, the results were not good. The main reason is that the sugarcane farmers have worked hard for half a year, and they always want to keep the cash for a while to feel comforted. Therefore, the deposit rate was only 1% on the first day. However, people couldn't feel safe with so much cash, so the number of deposits increased in two or three days, and reached 11% on the fourth day.</p>
<p>The bank does not want large sums of money to be hidden, which would increase the printing costs of banknotes or cause hoarding and speculation, thus negating the effect of the number of goods, so it hopes to deposit. The problem is how many items are deposited, and whether the paper is used to facilitate the bank's repayment. According to Fei, the funds are earmarked for rural reconstruction and production projects. At the same time, this direct deposit is enough to test the public's faith in the bank, and the economic phenomena revealed after merchants receive deposits.</p>
<p>The bank temporarily transferred 400 staff members to handle the mobile banking business. A conference of branch staff will be held in the south on the 24th and 25th of this month to discuss and explain the project, because this is an emerging business after all, and it needs the public's understanding.</p>
<p>Adopting this method to bring the bank deep into the countryside is indeed good news for sugarcane farmers, but the bank's chairman said that if the sugar company can use the American method and not adopt the deposit method, so that sugarcane farmers can use simple transfer or direct payment methods, the bank can save more manpower and financial resources, because in fact, the most experienced staff members can only count 3 million yuan in banknotes per day!</p>
<p>From the 21st, these twelve mobile bank cars will be scattered to the sugarcane-producing areas in central and southern Taiwan. It is hoped that the police can help and protect the safety and success of the mobile cars!</p>

<h3>Barber Demonstrates Public Spirit by Donating 100 Million to Build a Bridge</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Yangzhou, 22nd] The pedestrian bridge across the north and south banks outside Fuyunmen is four-tenths complete. The bridge is wooden, with a movable section in the middle that can be opened and closed. After completion, wheels can go directly from the city to the bus station on the opposite bank. The total cost is only over 400 million yuan, which will be raised through a surcharge of 1,000 yuan per ticket for cars and ships, with fundraising as the main source of income. Mr. Ren Darong, a local barber, donated 100 million yuan alone to show his support. The Construction Committee decided to name the bridge "Darong Bridge" to commemorate Mr. Ren's public spirit.</p>

<h3>Precious Celebration Jewelry Store Robbed in Nanchang's Bustling Market - Five Pairs of Gold Bracelets Vanish</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Nanchang, 22nd by Ship] On the evening of the 19th, a robbery occurred in a gold store on Zhongshan Road, a bustling street in Nanchang City. This is a major case since the city implemented its winter defense measures. The robbed gold store, Baoqing Jewelry Store, is located at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Cuihua Street, the most lively area in Nanchang City. At the time, a customer dressed in a Zhongshan suit with a gray overcoat, posing as a gold bracelet buyer, approached the counter with a blue cloth air raid bag and claimed to want to buy gold bracelets. The shop assistants looked at his appearance, and he didn't look like a wealthy customer, but they looked at the air raid bag he was carrying, and it seemed to be full of banknotes. In order to prevent any accidents, they invited the guest to the reception room to discuss business and took out five gold bracelets. He looked at them from left to right, tightly held the five bracelets in his left hand, and took out a pistol to escape. The shop assistants grabbed his overcoat but were knocked to the ground by the sound of a "bang." The uninvited guest took the opportunity to escape, firing two shots in a row, escaping towards Cuihua Street, accidentally stumbled and fell, got up and ran again. In an instant, the gold store's five gold bracelets were robbed by the uninvited guest. All the gold stores in the city immediately closed and were on high alert. The robber who robbed in public had visited several stores before entering Baoqing Gold Store, but the other gold stores acted cautiously and did not talk to him. After the robbery, Baoqing Gold Store checked the air raid bag left by the robber. It was filled with six bundles of paper money, which led to the judgment that the robber planned the deal and, after the event, investigated that several other gold stores seemed to have four or five people outside when the robber with the air raid bag contacted them. According to the news from the investigation agency this afternoon, the robber spoke with a Nanchang accent, but there are no clues so far. Song Xiangcheng, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, advocated military law for this case. If the case is solved, he will not send it to the court but will execute the robber immediately. Another news: the day before the Baoqing robbery, the Baoqing Jewelry Store next door was also robbed of two gold rings by a disguised robber. The police officers who were maintaining street traffic and security were performing their duties less than a hundred meters in front of the two gold stores when the robberies occurred.

<h3>Decline in Liling Porcelain Industry in Hunan</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Jingdezhen, 20th] Liling porcelain in Hunan Province is one of the famous porcelain-producing areas in China, with output second only to the fine porcelain produced in this city. The quality and craftsmanship of Liling porcelain are not considered crude among domestic products. It has a long history of more than a hundred years. Before the war, there were a total of 70 kilns, with 140,000 porcelain workers. Its products were sold in Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Kang and other provinces, with a total value of more than 50 million yuan. During the war, it fell into enemy hands, and kiln factories and porcelain merchants suffered heavy losses. Since the restoration, more than 20 kilns have resumed work, with more than 500 workers, about one-third of the pre-war number. Due to the imperfect scale and equipment, the current sales outlets in other places are only Wuhan and southern Henan. The cost of transporting porcelain from Hunan to Wuhan is more than 100,000 yuan per load, coupled with the imperfect transportation tools, the loss along the way is huge. Therefore, the future of Liling porcelain industry today, due to the narrow sales and the shortage of funds, is indeed in a state of falling off a cliff compared with the situation before the war.</p>
<p>Although the porcelain value this year has increased more than ten times compared with last year due to the increase in raw materials and wages, it is still difficult to improve in terms of production and sales. Recently, porcelain merchants from the producing area have come to Jingdezhen to visit porcelain-making technology and various suitable equipment, intending to go back to use them as a reference for preliminary improvements and to jointly seek the development of the industry's future. At present, Jiangxi porcelain still ranks first in the Hunan and Hubei markets, because the scale and raw material supply of Liling porcelain factories are not as good as the superior conditions of Jingdezhen porcelain. If it can be actively improved, it may be possible to restore the original market.</p>
<h3>Southern Great Port: A Magnificent Vision</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, 22nd] Since Chairman T.V. Soong took office, he seems to have brought boundless hope to the people of Guangdong. Enthusiastic voices for grand construction are rising like clouds, especially the development of Huangpu Port. Ever since Chairman Soong publicly announced that "construction will start immediately, without the need for five or ten-year plans," the work of building Huangpu Port has been underway. Huangpu Port, which has attracted attention from South China and even the whole country, and the future vision of Huangpu, are perhaps what more people are eagerly awaiting a concrete understanding of.</p>
<p>Huangpu is located in the southeast suburb of Guangzhou, about ten miles away. It faces the South China Sea's Lion Ocean (Shizi Yang), with the Pearl River's three tributaries (East, West, and North River) converging behind it. Leaning against Crane Crown Mountain, densely forested, it slopes down to the Yuzhu Plain, stretching endlessly. Huangpu Bay at the end of the Lion Ocean has a depth of thousands of fathoms, which is a natural condition for a port. With the grandeur of mountains and rivers and the convenience of river and sea access, it is no wonder that it is the base for the largest port in the South.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of Huangpu</p>
<p>It is unexpected that it is just a deserted suburb. Climbing up on an autumn day and looking out in all directions, on the one hand, it makes people yearn for the dream of a bustling port city, and on the other hand, it also makes people feel infinitely desolate and lonely when facing the mountains and rivers. There is a Huangpu Avenue from Guangzhou to Huangpu, which can be reached quickly by car. In addition, there is a Zhongshan Road that leads directly to the Yuzhu Market on the opposite side, making transportation very convenient (recently, the Huangpu branch line of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has also been built and opened to traffic, but it only transports construction materials for the port and does not carry passengers). Simple seawalls have been built along the coast of the port. There are dozens of warehouses left over from the enemy and puppet era on the seawalls, storing a large number of railway and wharf construction materials, ready for use at any time. The simple Huangpu Wharf has been quite lively recently, and no small amount of materials has been transported in. Near Huangpu Port, there is a Huangpu Market, where the world-famous cradle of revolution, the Huangpu Military Academy, is located. The market is small but complete, with everything one could want. The market is lively, and after the port is developed in the future, it will become the "Xiaguan" of Guangzhou—the situation between Huangpu and Guangzhou seems very similar to the relationship between Xiaguan and Nanjing—what is particularly worth mentioning in the market is the Huangpu scrambled eggs, famous throughout South China for being fragrant and smooth. Perhaps the Huangpu generals who are today renowned for their exploits across the country still have lingering memories of it.</p>
<p>The Plan for Developing the Port</p>
<p>Counting it all up, it has been twenty years. During that time, due to changes in the political situation, followed by the invasion of enemy cavalry from the south, everything was "started in words and ended in words." In 1933, Guangdong had a river management committee. In the autumn of 1936, it was reorganized into the Huangpu Port Development Supervisory Office, with Mr. Zeng Yangfu in charge. The American consultant "Coolidge" was hired to come to Guangdong specifically to inspect and draft the Huangpu Port Development Plan. Construction of the first and second sandbar projects outside Huangpu Port was immediately begun, and landfilling of the embankment along the port was started, the Huangpu Avenue was built, and the roadbed for the Huangpu branch line of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was laid. Just when everything was proceeding smoothly, less than two years later, the enemy invaded, and all the efforts were in vain again. When the enemy occupied Guangzhou, they also added some engineering projects due to military needs, but after the victory, they were all destroyed. In addition, there was no one to manage it, so Huangpu once again became a barren island. The development of Huangpu Port is perhaps an ideal goal, so a large number of engineering personnel immediately came to Guangdong (including Chinese and American port experts) and drafted a port development plan. The general steps are roughly divided into four phases:</p>
<p>First Phase of Construction</p>
<p>First, complete the river excavation project and dredge the Lingdingyang sand bottom. Complete the 2.6-mile Huangpu Avenue road surface project and the Huangpu branch line and depot of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Complete the filling work in the western Wuyong and southern Zhujiangyong. Build 1,150 feet of reinforced concrete embankment, and two inspection plants, 150 feet long and 300 feet wide. Install tap water pipes and establish underground drainage channels. Build the Huangpu Port Engineering Office building and staff dormitory. Set up two elementary schools, one middle school, two police stations, and one each of fire, cleaning, and road maintenance stations, and one modern market. In total, the completion of the first phase of the plan will develop Huangpu into a city with a preliminary scale and an area of ​​93 acres, which can accommodate a population of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 people, of which the store area will account for 240,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Construction</p>
<p>Continue to develop the embankment to the left and right by approximately 1,800 feet to 2,300 feet, add 400 feet of market area, and the city population can increase to more than 50,000 people. Establish public utilities, and the market revenue will absorb residents to move in. Add six elementary schools, eight elementary schools, three middle schools, four markets, and establish a police headquarters and post office. In this phase of the project, based on a 100-year flood level (10.8355 meters), the height will gradually decrease from the embankment side of 10.785 and extend the embankment by 5,000 feet to prevent flooding.</p>
<p>Third Phase of Construction</p>
<p>Expand the port city, all areas north of Zhujiang Village, south of Xihua Workshop, west of Hengsha, and east of Tangkou are included. Another base west of Konghugang and east of Xuefeng Mountain is developed as a residential and commercial area. Develop water sources in Shixia and Wenchong. Add a embankment from Wuyong South to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station, and continue to complete 16,000 feet of wharf. Establish 27 elementary schools, 11 middle schools, 17 police stations, and 10 fire stations. The expansion area in this phase has reached 1,000 acres.</p>
<p>Final Phase of Construction</p>
<p>This phase is the completion phase of the development of Huangpu Port. The area includes the entire Huangpu area, north of Zhongshan Avenue, south of the starting section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Road, and east of Changzhou Port to the wild suburbs along the Dongjiang River. The total area is a wide 11,000 acres, and the projected population is 750,000 to 1 million. The development of Huangpu Port will be declared a complete success.</p>
<p>However, the actual difficulties have also caused many difficulties in the port development project, such as insufficient funding, lack of talent, and divergent opinions and resistance from the local area, all of which have caused the port development project to often encounter some unexpected disturbances. Perhaps the most interesting of these is the dispute over the responsibilities for developing the port.</p>
<p>Originally, after the central government decided on the principle of developing Huangpu Port, the initial intention was nothing more than to make Huangpu a sub-port in addition to Guangzhou Port, to supplement Guangzhou's inadequacies. However, local opinions believed that the development of Huangpu Port was a predetermined construction plan of the founding father of the country, and it was necessary to establish a port with the same value as Guangzhou. The former central government established a Guangzhou</p>
<p>Port Engineering Bureau</p>
<p>in Guangzhou this October, and appointed Tao Shuzeng as the director. This year's engineering fee is 5 billion, and it will increase to 500 billion next year. The preliminary plan for the sub-port established by the Port Engineering Bureau includes: Building the Southwest Iron Bridge, Repairing the inner port wharfs and warehouses and the Henan Daban Wharf, Dredging the Pearl River rear waterway (with the principle that 10,000-ton ships can freely enter and exit Huangpu), and the First and Second Sandbars and the Lingdingyang sand bottom, Building 75 square feet of wharfs and warehouses in Huangpu, and repairing the original wharfs and warehouses, Adding 50 cranes and tugboats each, Building the Huangpu Shipyard, Setting up all public facilities in Huangpu. The completion of the entire project plan is also easier, but it will only make Huangpu a "large wharf" for transportation, and cannot establish a perfect port city. Therefore, shortly after Chairman Soong arrived, he convened the two bureau chiefs (the director of the Pearl River Conservancy Bureau was Yang Huari) to inquire about the detailed situation in order to determine the form of port development and allocate responsibilities. Mr. Soong seemed to approve of the latter plan and has already ordered it to be implemented. Generally speaking, establishing a port in Huangpu that can be comparable to Guangzhou will no longer be a problem.</p>
<p>The Only Problem</p>
<p>is just the length of time it will take. Currently, the land price near Huangpu has changed from a price of about 10,000 yuan per well to a number of 300 Hong Kong dollars in just two or three months, and people are still rushing to buy it. It is heard that the Provincial Government and the Four Banks have jointly formed: Huangpu Port Development Company is preparing to establish large-scale enterprises in Huangpu, acquire land, and build factories and wharfs. Everyone is thinking about what a beautiful vision it will be when 10,000-ton giant ships sail directly to the Huangpu embankment. (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)</p>

<h3>A Stroll Through the Pen Market</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch on the 24th] The higher the level of modern culture, the more complex the way of life and work. At least one or two fountain pens are found in the pockets of men and women in Europe and America. In recent years, the use of fountain pens has gradually become popular in China, and it has become one of the emerging industries in major cities. According to one of the famous Parker companies that the reporter recently visited, there are a wide variety of them. The layout of the company, the lighting, the color of the products, and the spirit of the salespersons all make people feel a bit special. According to Mr. Niu Yongji, the general manager of the company, the company adopts scientific management, and personnel undergo considerable training. The business advocates modernization and socialization.</p>
<p>The reporter visited the pen inspection department (which is a novel name), where several technicians are using ink testing machines, writing trace machines, probes, magnifying glasses, etc., to perform local inspections on each fountain pen. The reporter asked him if the pen factory had already inspected it, why it was necessary to reinspect it. He said that the pen factory focuses on large and rapid production volume and cannot conduct detailed inspections. It is necessary to locally inspect each pen here before it can be completely completed. In 144 pens, it is guaranteed that there will not be a single one that is unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Then to the pen repair department, the location is more open, and the staff wears white uniforms. They do not use manual labor, but use electric machines to repair pens. It is said that ordinary repairs, such as leaks and cleaning, are all free services, so this department loses a lot every year. There are about 20 small lathes, saws, drilling machines, money machines, polishing machines, etc. in the room. Among them, there is a machine that is the latest British-style spot plating machine, which uses strong electric sparks to spot plate platinum on the nib. It is said that the quality of a fountain pen depends entirely on the nib, and the soul of the nib is the platinum on it. If the platinum is plated round and even, writing will be smooth.</p>
<p>The staff in the engraving department are operating an American electric engraving machine to work. The customer can sign their name casually on paper, and it can be reduced five times on this machine to engrave a true copy. In the past year, more than 20 government agencies and business groups went to the company to buy pens and engrave them as gifts during the holidays.</p>
<p>The mail order department handles the business of answering inquiries, pricing, packing, and mailing. The sound of typewriters in the room never stops, and the packages on the table are piled up like cars. The reporter discovered a package that was going to Nanyang, which was very surprising. Later, I learned that people in Nanyang could have bought pens in the Philippines, but if we provide loyal service, they would rather buy them from even further away.</p>
<p>Later, when asked about the history of fountain pen evolution in recent years, he said that the pen was originally used with a leather tube, but because it was easy to get dirty and corroded, the American Parker Pen Company invented the vacuum tube in 1922. In addition to cleaning, it can also see the ink volume. In 1941, the 51-type pen was created with a special water-saving button inside that could not leak water, which became the culmination of fountain pens. The reporter asked: After the invention of the ballpoint pen, will fountain pens be eliminated? He said no, because ballpoint pens cannot include the wonderful ability of fountain pens to vary the thickness of the nib, but ballpoint pens are also particularly convenient for copying, registering, and traveling.</p>
<p>There are many pen brands on the market, and they are so beautiful that buyers don't know where to start. Which pen should I buy? He replied that fountain pens must not leak water and must have a smooth nib before they can be purchased. The pens produced by four companies, namely Parker, Eversharp, Waterman, and Sheaffer, are equipped with special non-leakage buttons, and the nibs are also finely polished, meeting the above two conditions. He was also asked about the method of protecting the pen. He said that as long as you suck and release the pen in cold water once or twice a week, you can clean the inside and avoid all kinds of diseases.</p>

<p>The Blue and White teams have competed twice. In the first game, the White team won 4-1, and the second game ended in a 1-1 draw. This is the third time they will meet, and the official lineup will be produced after the game. It is expected that they will display their superb skills at this final juncture to compete for the honor of representing the port. Therefore, it is expected that the performance will be wonderful and the battle will be exciting.</p>
<p>The Blue team's lineup today is exceptionally neat and can be called the ideal team. Striker Banglun, defenders Li Yichen and Wu Qixiang are a pair of iron gates, exceptionally strong. In the center back line, Yiliang sits in the center, supplemented by Nibo and Baozheng, which is also very appropriate. Forward Xiao Huangmao is the leader in the center, with Sun Laojin and Xiao Jin on the left, and Xia Tixian and Xiao Fei on the right. The combination is reasonable, and the charge is bound to be extremely sharp. Looking at the whole team, the attack and defense are both excellent, and it is impeccable.</p>
<h3>White Team's Possibility</h3>
<p>The White team is the "possibility" team. The goalkeeper is the newcomer Xu Fusheng, with Chen Jiawan and Xu Erz appointed as left and right backs. In the center back line, Afu sits in the center, assisted by Edward and McRee, the defense is quite strong. The forwards are Long Hai, Li Yao, Qingxiang, Carlo Rique, and Grinas, the offensive power is not weak. It is predicted that there will be a bloody battle with the Blue team.</p>
<p>The original nine games of Group B and C football matches today were changed due to the wet ground in Zhongzheng Park.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Sugar 25,000 Tons Shipped to Japan, Contract Signed with Allied Headquarters, Delivery at Taiwan Pier at US$200 Per Ton, Shipped and Loaded by Allied Forces, Expected to be Completed by the End of April</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Song Yixin, Assistant Manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, flew directly from Shanghai to Tokyo on the 12th to negotiate the shipment of Taiwan sugar to Japan, and took a flight back to Shanghai yesterday afternoon after completing his business. He told reporters: Since Japan opened up foreign trade in mid-August last year, all parties have made sufficient preparations. Therefore, when foreign trade representatives arrive in Tokyo, they can quickly conduct negotiations on trade matters. At present, Japan has established a Trade Agency to manage and negotiate Japan's foreign trade affairs. After trade representatives from various countries arrive in Japan, they can first negotiate with the Japanese Trade Agency on the procedures and conditions for trade. After approval by the Foreign Trade Group of the Economic and Scientific Department of the Allied Forces, they can start processing. However, in order to adjust the surplus and deficit of Japan's domestic and foreign trade, the Allied Forces have not completely equated the domestic and export prices of a certain export commodity.</p>
<p>Negotiations for the first batch of Taiwan sugar to be shipped to Japan began as early as March last year. At that time, because the Japanese Trade Agency had not yet been established, negotiations were directly conducted with the Allied authorities in charge. The total amount of the first batch of sugar to be shipped to Japan was negotiated to be 25,000 tons, and the delivery price per ton in Taiwan at that time was US$335. Later, due to various reasons, the Allied Forces did not have time to send ships to transport it. In addition, the price of sugar fell day by day, and after repeated negotiations, it was decided that the transaction price would be US$200 per ton for delivery in Taiwan. The sugar payment was allocated by the Allied Forces from the funds for relief and reconstruction in Japan, so it was a cash transaction. When signing the contract, the tonnage of national ships had not yet recovered, and it was agreed that delivery would be made at the Taiwan pier, so the Allied Forces will send ships to Taiwan to load the sugar. It is expected that all of them can be loaded by the end of April this year. After the establishment of the Japanese Trade Bureau, future shipments of sugar to Japan must be negotiated with the bureau. And the foreign trade of the bureau is based on barter in principle, and the bureau itself does not have cash to import foreign goods. Therefore, the matter of shipping the second batch of Taiwan sugar to Japan still needs to be negotiated.</p>
<p>In addition, during this stay in Japan, the Korean Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to Japan to negotiate the import of Taiwan sugar. The reason is that the sugar originally ordered by Korea from Cuba is in danger of being interrupted due to the strike of Cuban sugar workers. Therefore, it is planned to import 120,000 tons of Taiwan sugar to adjust the supply. However, Korea's foreign barter is also mainly based on barter. And many of the materials exported by Korea are not necessary for our country. Therefore, our country still hopes to trade in cash in principle, and negotiations are still underway.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again Inland, Indica and Japonica Prices Increase</h3>
<p>A total of 7,100+ shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets yesterday. The weather was severely cold with snow flurries, and prices rose inland, stirring up people's emotions. Japonica and Indica rice both saw sharp increases, ranging from 5, 6, 7 million, and White Yuan also followed suit, rising 3, 5 million, and Yin Yuan also rose 2, 3 million. Flour digestion was active and brisk, continuing to soar by more than 20,000 yuan. At noon, the factory sold a large amount at 580,000 yuan, slightly softening the price. Bran sales to rural areas turned brisk, and prices rose sharply by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cakes continued to be handled by guest traders, and the factory was firm in its selling price due to high raw material costs, gradually increasing by 20,000 yuan, but the closing price was light. Guest traders scrambled to purchase yellow soybeans, demand exceeded supply, and prices soared, rising another 5, 60,000 yuan. Soybean goods were held firm by merchants, and prices soared by 7, 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Individual households absorbed red beans, and guest traders also inquired actively, with a sudden increase of 5, 60,000 yuan. Broad beans also showed vitality, rising 4, 50,000 yuan. Cowpeas rose along with other commodities, rising 3, 50,000 yuan. There were not many stocks of red sorghum, and prices gradually rose by 2, 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The going out of corn in the Northern Ocean region was still slack, and raw peanuts were increasingly handled in Guangdong, with local merchants competing to purchase them, and prices continued to rise by more than 100,000 yuan. Oil mills continued to absorb sesame, with local merchants active, and deals were also made in Tianjin, with prices rising step by step, increasing by another 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market rose rapidly in the morning, and then fell back at noon. As a result, the price of each oil rose by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the flour market, in order to completely flatten the price of flour, the Food Department must improve the approved transshipment procedures and cooperate with the local authorities in this city in order to achieve results. In the past, flour exports were generally applied for directly to the Food Department by merchants for a transshipment license, and then purchased at high prices from the market or production areas, which had a great impact on market prices. He suggested that the Food Department should directly stipulate the amount and price of transshipped flour for manufacturers each month when examining transshipped flour in the future, and then contact the relevant authorities in this city to avoid the drawbacks of issuing too many quantities and the activities of unscrupulous merchants stimulating flour prices.</p>
<h3>Internal Exchange Rate Readjusted</h3>

<h3>Problem of Opening Industrial Goods, Under Study by the Joint Administration</h3>
<p>The Review Committee for the Handling of Foreign Exchange Goods Held its 19th Meeting Yesterday Afternoon to Discuss the Review of Western Medicines and Dyes, as well as Distribution Procedures. The resolutions were as follows: 1. The original requirement for importers to apply for the distribution of originally imported goods to be stamped by the relevant trade association has now been changed to a certificate from a reputable manufacturer in order to simplify procedures and facilitate manufacturers. 2. The markup ratio for the distribution of a certain type of dye has been decided at the last meeting, but because importers raised objections, a consensus has been reached after consulting with manufacturers, and it will be announced for implementation within the next week. As for the markup ratio for Western medicines, a part has been agreed upon, but because there are many types, discussions will continue next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Difficult to Resume Before the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] There is no hope for the resumption of industrial loans before the Lunar New Year. In order to solve the current difficulties in the industrial sector, the government is studying other remedial measures. In North China, it has been decided that the government will purchase industrial finished products to replace industrial loans. Whether this method is applicable to the Southeast and the Beijing-Shanghai area is currently under consideration. There are rumors that a temporary emergency loan will be held before the Lunar New Year, but people from the Joint Administration denied it on the 24th, saying that this is definitely impossible.</p>
<h3>Artifical Silk Allocation Price Determined</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau has decided on the following distribution prices for rayon for next week: 1. A-grade: Dongyang 73.6 million yuan, Tianqiao 73 million yuan, other 72.6 million yuan. 2. A-grade: Dongyang 72.14 million yuan, Tianqiao 71.54 million yuan, other 71.14 million yuan. 3. A-grade: Dongyang 69.92 million yuan, Tianqiao 69.36 million yuan, other 68.98 million yuan. 4. A-grade: Dongyang 66.24 million yuan, Tianqiao 65.7 million yuan, other 65.34 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Running a Securities Business, It is Appropriate to Have a Noble Style</h3>
<p>Recently, restaurants and tea houses in the city have set up securities firms. The securities exchange authorities sent a letter to the brokers association yesterday, stating: "The securities exchange is a part of the financial business, and each broker should attach importance to his own position and set up an independent business establishment for specialized operations. If it is mixed with illegal organizations such as black market gold shops or underground banks, it will inevitably be implicated. Those attached to dance halls, hotels, restaurants, and tea rooms are noisy and unsuitable. As for using coffee and meal coupons as a gimmick to attract customers, the general impression is not good. This business style seems to need to be revamped. It concerns the noble status of all brokers, and it is hereby notified that you should check and be aware of it at any time."</p>
<h3>India Bans Cotton Exports, No Impact on Our Cotton Exchange</h3>
<p>Regarding India's ban on cotton exports, the person in charge of the Textile Export Committee explained yesterday: India's ban on cotton exports from yesterday only applies to the Buddhist area, such as Mumbai, while cotton in other cities such as the Muslim area can still be exported as usual. Since China and India negotiated the exchange of yarn and cloth for cotton, up to now, it has reached 100,000 bales. Although a part of the 100,000 bales that were traded is in the Buddhist area, they can still be exported as usual without any impact. Afterwards, the association notified our country's yarn and cloth merchants to continue to negotiate with Indian merchants in other Muslim areas for the exchange of yarn and cloth for cotton. Therefore, in terms of the actual situation, India's ban on cotton exports in Mumbai and other places has no impact on our exchange of yarn and cloth for cotton. In order to enrich our country's cotton sources, the association has recently negotiated with South Asian and African countries to purchase foreign cotton, but the price has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Rescuing the Crisis of Industry and Commerce in North China: The Government Decides to Adopt a Purchasing Method; Liu Gongyun Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The problems of factories and export goods in Ji, Ping, and Tianjin urgently need to be resolved. After repeated discussions between representatives of petitioners and relevant authorities, the relevant authorities have sincerely expressed their determination to resolve the above issues. As for the solution, a purchasing method will be adopted. Detailed measures are currently being drafted. Furthermore, Liu Gongyun, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, went to Beijing on the 22nd to resolve the financial and export goods issues in North China, representing Governor Zhang. Mr. Liu returned to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 24th). It is understood that this trip was extremely successful. After discussions with relevant ministries and commissions and the petitioning delegation, concrete decisions were made on the above two issues: In terms of finance, it was decided to follow Chairman Chiang's instructions that industrial loans will not be temporarily opened before the Lunar New Year. However, for factories that absolutely need funds for the New Year, a purchasing method will be adopted to purchase their finished products appropriately within the New Year. A portion of export goods can be purchased. As for the purchasing plan, it has already begun to be drafted in Shanghai. Mr. Liu reported the process of this trip to Governor Zhang at noon and discussed the purchasing methods.</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, summoned Deputy Governor Liu Gongyun, who had just returned to Shanghai from Beijing, and Shen Xirui, Director of the Business Bureau of the Bank, to discuss the issue of restoring industrial loans in the Governor's office for a long time yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares Continue to Rise; Small Caps Are Even More Sought After</h3>

<h3>Strong Buying Interest from Local and External Investment Groups; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Firm; 42-count Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Breaks 60 Million</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation yesterday, at the opening, sentiment was still firm, and each yarn opened high.

Other coarse and fine yarns of all counts also rose in unison by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to 1.56 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market yesterday, at the opening, the asking price was still firm. Later, due to the buying of serge cloth by gangs from Shanxi and Fujian, as well as short-sellers covering their positions, the market trend rose. However, at around 10 o'clock, due to the need for year-end bonuses for factory employees, a large amount of inventory was released, and it was also heard that there was no hope for the resumption of industrial loans, and the positions in the industry were still tight, and the selling sentiment intensified near the close. Therefore, the final 12-pound fine cloth of all grades showed a trend of mixed gains and losses compared with the previous day, but serge and bleached cloth were uniquely sought after, while the rest of the cloths were stable.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 18,620 pieces, with 465 applications, of which 10 were from manufacturers, purchasing 400 pieces, and the rest were purchased by cloth stores.</p>
<p>Provincial and Municipal Banks and Credit Institutions: Do Not Enter into Interbank Remittance Agreements</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that local provinces and cities and commercial institutions have entered into interbank remittance agreements to handle remittances on behalf of customers, it is inevitable that deposits and withdrawals will occur, which is clearly inconsistent with Article 3(b) of the recently revised and promulgated Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Operations: "The deposits of provincial and municipal banks with correspondent banks, except those in areas where there is no central bank, may be deposited in other national banks and treasuries, shall be deposited in the local central bank in their entirety, and shall not deposit funds in other national banks and treasuries or re-deposit them in commercial institutions in any way." Therefore, it is expressly stipulated again that provincial and municipal banks shall not enter into interbank remittance agreements with commercial institutions in the future, and those that have already been entered into shall be cleared, the agreements terminated, and reports submitted.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to relevant sources: The Ministry of Economic Affairs issued an instruction to Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Yarn Control Committee, yesterday, stating that the Committee's tasks are arduous, and all affairs must be handled prudently. It also instructed that all regulations should be submitted to the Ministry for approval before they can be implemented. All official documents should follow the administrative system and be submitted to the Ministry first, and should not be submitted over levels. Personnel above the recommended rank should be submitted for approval by the Ministry, and the appointment of employees should also be reported to the Ministry for approval. Furthermore, it is restricted that except for the offices already established in Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Tianjin, no other regions may be added without the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<h3>Trade in Woolen Fabrics Becomes Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the retail business of woolen fabrics was quiet due to the imminent Chinese New Year, etc. The wholesale of original bales and whole boxes also became quiet for this reason. In general, most of them stopped rising and remained stable. Looking back, the principle of woolen fabric stores is to replenish what is sold out, and they are unwilling to replenish what has not been sold out.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Are Active</h3>
<p>The daily necessities soap market, due to the support of the goods owners, coupled with the weekend bill discount rate, the market is trending firm, and those who enter and exit with cash are slightly lower than the closing price. The cash price of Guben soap was 1.74 million yuan, and transactions were active in the afternoon, with the price rising to 1.775 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Arrow Knife soap rose by 40,000 yuan to 1.74 million yuan. The news of Huang Xiangmao's distribution of goods was silent, and actual sales were very healthy, rising by 55,000 yuan. The remaining Guanghua, Meili, and other soaps also rose by 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000 yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>Match transactions were also active, and both the Meili and Phoenix brands rose by 200,000, both at 9.2 million yuan. The Ningbo, Nanjing, Rose, Tiger, and other brands also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. The kerosene market was stable.</p>
<h3>More Cigarette Purchases, Trend Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market situation, the opening sentiment was still good, buyers were still active, coupled with the weekend relationship, two-day bills, scattered retail investors pulled up quite vigorously, the price was lifted up. At noon closing, there were rumors of selling at a profit, the money supply was still tight, and the general floating gains took advantage of the high prices to exit, and the off-market price was shouted down. 10 packs of British American Tobacco sold for 33.5 million yuan, and the rest were also lower than the listed price.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market trend turned firm, and there were many who absorbed at low prices, and interbank transactions were also strong. By the end, 10 packs of British American Tobacco cigarettes rose to 34.3 million yuan per case, an increase of 1.35 million compared with the previous day, and Old Knife was also 900,000 higher, at 27.75 million yuan. The remaining Chinese and foreign cigarettes of all kinds also rose by 500 yuan to 4,500 yuan each.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 50-piece canned cigarettes, due to the arrival of goods from Hankou and Tianjin, the market situation lacked the strength to rise. Calique was willing to sell at 2.2156 million yuan, and the result was a small loss of 5,000 yuan, and the price of 3-5 brands also took a small loss.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Export Goods: Exporters Should Pay Attention to the Purchasing Price</h3>
<p>After the announcement of the measures for purchasing export goods, exporters in this city have paid close attention to this. According to an export magnate, after the implementation of the measures, the foreign market can be expanded, but the sales matters after the China Trust Bureau purchases should be entrusted to exporters to handle in order to maintain the exporters' business and achieve the effect of earning foreign exchange. It is also said that the government's discussion on the purchasing price should be based on the following two principles: The purchasing price at the place of origin should first estimate the total production cost, and then be based on the living expenses of its producers and the production raw materials as the purchasing price at the place of origin. The purchasing price in the concentration area should be added to the freight, re-packaging and other expenses, and the legal profits of the transportation merchants, so that it can be purchased smoothly, otherwise the holders of loans may not be willing to sell.</p>
<h3>Simplified Procedures for Distribution of Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods; Application Can Be Made with Proof of Real Factories with Shares</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 24th] The Four Banks Joint Office previously solicited opinions from various banks and treasuries on the opening of industrial loans.

The two banks and bureaus also advocated opening loans, but the Central Bank has not yet submitted its opinions. The Four Banks Joint Office is now waiting for the Central Bank to submit its opinions before proceeding to study the claims and plans put forward by various banks and bureaus.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Soar</h3>
<p>The industrial raw materials market situation is due to the lack of supply, and all parties are actively purchasing, resulting in dwindling inventories and soaring asking prices. Moon brand caustic soda has soared by 3 million per barrel to 54 million yuan, and soda ash has also risen to 6 million yuan per bag, an increase of 200,000. American caustic soda rose by 3.5 million, 52.5 million per barrel, and white wax rose by 300,000 per dan to 6.3 million yuan. In addition, American N rosin, baking soda, insurance powder, yellow and white Vaseline, etc., have also risen significantly.</p>
<h3>Ramie Origin Prices Are High</h3>
<p>The ramie market situation is due to the scarcity of goods at the place of origin and frequent price increases, resulting in a scarce supply, and actual sales are very healthy, the inventory is decreasing day by day, and the transaction price is soaring. Yesterday, the association listed the price of white ramie at 4.45 million per dan, 4.8 million for door sales, and Hangzhou ramie at 2.2 million, 2.6 million for door sales, an increase of 10-20%. Green and yellow ramie were not available on the market.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Atmosphere is Firm</h3>
<p>The domestic sales tea, which has been selling smoothly in recent days, continued to be strong yesterday due to the strong buying interest from both local and external investment groups. In terms of price, all are opening at firm prices. As for the foreign bank tea market, the situation is as calm as ever, the appetite of exporters is still narrow, but the market sentiment is still trending towards improvement, so it is also frequently firm.</p>

<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau has transferred the order to the Department Store Association to inform all members to register nylon stockings within a limited time. The registration date is from now until the 11th of next month. After the registration is completed, the Social Bureau will convene the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industry Association to discuss and determine the sale and the sale deadline, but will not investigate its source. After the deadline, the sale of nylon stockings will be prohibited in the market, and violators will be punished.</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Office of the Resources Committee: The output of the Resources Committee's Taiwan Aluminum Factory has been approximately 5,000 tons per month since it resumed work in mid-December last year. Currently, the raw materials are purchased from South Asia, but if the raw materials increase, the output can be increased. The Reno Company is currently preparing to invest in the factory.</p>
<p>The price of the goods distributed by the China Trust Bureau is much lower than the market price, so most of the distributors resell them for profit instead of directly processing them. Cao, the section chief of the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, specially convened the responsible persons of the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Industry, Wide and Narrow Belt Industry, and Knitting Industry Association yesterday afternoon to assist in investigating the distributors and manufacturers of resold materials in various industries, and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of reselling distributed materials. He persuaded his colleagues not to resell distributed materials any longer.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Sichuan-Guizhou Factories Joint Association held a general meeting of all employees and factories yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., chaired by Hu Juewen, to earnestly review the specific measures for requesting the Chang Bureau to allocate Japanese reparations.</p>

<h3>Compensation and Relief</h3>
<p>On January 18th, the California Wheel transported the first batch of 190,000 bags of American relief flour; on January 22nd, the Haikang Wheel transported the first batch of 453 pieces of Japanese compensation machines. The former is the "help in need" of American friends to us, a substantial assistance, and the latter is the price paid by the "chief culprit of the war," the Japanese warlords, for their acts of aggression.</p>
<p>The significance of relief materials, as U.S. Consul General Cabot said at the welcoming ceremony: "This food is donated by the American people to the Chinese people who are currently suffering temporarily, and can be regarded as clear evidence of the United States' willingness to continue to provide relief and restore the post-war order." This sincere friendship will make the Chinese people never forget. At the same time, we firmly believe that as long as we work hard and make unremitting efforts, what is called "God helps those who help themselves," foreign aid will continue to flow in and help us overcome today's difficult and troubled situation.</p>
<p>The acquisition of compensation machines is what we exchanged for after eight years of the War of Resistance, sacrificing the lives and property of countless soldiers and civilians. Therefore, we feel all the more that this batch of materials is extremely precious. How to avoid waste and seek the best use of materials: How to make good use of them and engage in reconstruction and nation-building, this is the major task of the receiving institutions in the future, and it is also the ardent hope of the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Relief materials and compensation materials, like rounds of new blood cells, will continue to be transported into the heart of the Republic of China. Looking forward to the future, we cannot help but feel joyful and encouraged!</p>

<h3>On Popular Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yu</p>
<p>Many years ago, I wrote many articles that examined or studied popular literature. At that time, I thought that popular literature was literature that was well-liked by the public, so advocating popular literature was a very meaningful thing. Moreover, it was worthwhile to pick up what others had discarded, and there was much to be gained in this barren field.</p>
<p>However, later, I suddenly thought, besides making a contribution to literary historians, what use are mere textual research and study for popular literature itself? What impact does it have on the public to simply study the authors of Yuan and Ming dramas, or to trace the origins of Ming and Qing novels? Moreover, is so-called popular literature - here, it refers specifically to storybooks, dramas, ballads, etc. since the Song and Yuan dynasties - itself worth advocating, and is it hoped that it will continue to develop? I am afraid that these questions have not been taken into account by most popular literature researchers. In fact, it is a question that should be decided first.</p>
<p>I believe that the mistake of most popular literature researchers is to "devalue the present and value the past", focusing solely on research without considering creation. Because they "devalue the present and value the past," they - including myself - turn a blind eye to the most popular and well-liked popular reading materials in modern society, while regarding things like the Yuan Dynasty carved edition of "The Complete Picture of Five Kinds of Pinghua" as priceless treasures. In my opinion, those Yuan carved editions of "The Complete Picture of Five Kinds of Pinghua" are really just Yuan Dynasty comic books, and the semi-literate text and superstitious and absurd ideas are simply far inferior to some of the good comic books that are popular today. The same is true of other dramas, ballads, and the like. What is there to study? If it is worth studying, then when the current comic books, after hundreds of years, exist as rare copies, will researchers regard them as "The Complete Picture of Five Kinds of Pinghua" II, and also regard them as priceless treasures? Then why don't we cherish them now and let them wait until hundreds of years later? Once this is said, we feel that it is a little ridiculous to use all our energy to study the same things from ancient times. As for saying that creation is not what I advocate must be promoted, my meaning is that if something is considered worthy of study, then it must also be applied. If we think that old popular literature has research value, then we should create new popular literature to make it develop and be useful. Otherwise, studying without creating is a futile effort.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am now no longer interested in researching popular literature, but rather interested in creating popular literature. Because I have seen how the sales of translated versions of world famous works and creations by famous writers cannot catch up with the sales of those novels with sensational labels, and the former may not be consulted again once they are out of date, while the latter are sold year after year. It can be seen that in China, where education is not universal and the level of knowledge has not improved, even though there is new spiritual food that is hygienic and nutritious, it is not swallowed because it does not suit the taste. Temporarily, porridge, rice and vegetables are still suitable for the public's taste and are worth improving and promoting. For example, rewriting Pushkin's "Dubrovsky" into the style of a Chinese martial arts novel, as long as the author's original intention is not distorted, the sales may not be inferior to "The Strange Hero of the Rivers and Lakes." Ba Jin's "Home" is the best-selling book, and some people say that its style is influenced by "Dream of the Red Chamber." This means that new creations that are influenced by popular novels can increase their readership. So why don't we simply go straight to the road of creating popular novels?</p>
<p>But what I advocate is creating popular literature, not putting new wine in old bottles, but eating big dishes with bamboo chopsticks, which is temporary, not permanent.</p>
<h3>The Way to Prosperity</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>A traveler who crossed the continent lost his way during his journey and arrived in a remote part of the Oshkosh Mountains. It was getting late, and he was happy to see a lonely thatched cottage ahead, so he wouldn't miss a place to stay. The traveler ran to knock on the door, and a farmer came out to answer, promising to let him stay at home for the night.</p>
<p>After dinner, the traveler thought he should exchange pleasantries with the host for a while. "It must be difficult to maintain a rural expenditure in this place," he said. "May I ask how you support yourself?"</p>
<p>The host stroked his beard and pointed to the farmhand who was silently eating at the end of the table, saying, "Do you see the person eating at the table? That's right, he works for me, but I can't pay him wages. Therefore, after two years, the land will all be in his name. So I work for him, to the point where I "do" the land back. We have been doing land exchanges like this for twenty-two years, so our business is developing, and we still want to find a companion."</p>
<h3>Parisian Consultants</h3>
<p>— Copper Camel</p>
<p>Wireless dispatches report a simple account: an aircraft passing through Paris crashed in the suburbs. Upon hearing this news, Parisians quickly sought to inquire about the downed aircraft. However, in their panicked state, they didn't need to flip through the phone book. They simply called SVP and the operator would provide detailed information about the crashed plane.</p>
<p>After the death of Roosevelt, the French press frantically searched their reference archives for materials on his successor, Truman, but pitifully found very little, not enough to be useful. Someone suggested, why not try SVP? One phone call provided a wealth of reference materials.</p>
<p>What exactly is SVP? It is an organization that uses the telephone to serve the 25 million people of Paris. SVP is an abbreviation of a French phrase, S’il Vous Plait, meaning "If you please," which I think can be freely translated as "Convenient Information," because SVP is a telephone service agency, and our early telephones were called "De Lv Feng" (德律風, transliteration of telephone). "De Yin" (德音, virtuous sound) here carries a double meaning. SVP receives thousands of inquiries daily, and most can be answered within minutes. Its service scope is so broad that it can almost be considered a living world almanac.</p>
<p>A child in France was critically ill, on the brink of death. The doctor said that the only savior was penicillin. The mother asked several pharmacies, all of whom said they didn't have it. Later, she asked one that also didn't have it, but they referred her to SVP. Sure enough, she received a satisfactory answer: they found a pharmacy with penicillin in stock and sent someone to urgently buy it and deliver it to her home.</p>
<p>A hostess in Paris was having guests over. All the guests had arrived, but one was missing, who sent a note saying they couldn't attend due to important matters. The guests looked at each other, afraid to sit down, because including the host, there were thirteen people, an unlucky number! The host was at a loss, and temporarily inviting other relatives and friends would be impolite and they might not be able to come. What to do? Suddenly, someone thought of SVP. After explaining the situation over the phone, their hope was fulfilled: within half an hour, a well-dressed representative arrived, making the total number fourteen.</p>
<p>An astrologer asked SVP about the founding date of the Communist Party, wanting them to provide the exact year, month, day, and hour in order to calculate the Communist Party's destiny. He said on the phone, "A famous politician is waiting for my calculation as a reference." This inquiry was answered without delay.</p>
<p>Most of the inquiries to SVP are about very important matters, so their work is also very demanding. SVP's clients are on a basic subscription system, with monthly fees ranging from 125 to 1,800 francs (approximately one to fifteen US dollars), depending on the number of calls and the complexity of the services. When the war ended, Remington Typewriter Company received a batch of military typewriters, numbering in the thousands, that needed to be repaired before they could be used. If they were not repainted and internally refurbished, they could not be sold or rented. The repair shop estimated it would take at least several months to repair them. SVP found Remington a repair shop that completed the repairs in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>SVP was founded in 1935 by Georges Mandel, the French Minister of Transportation, who was later shot by the Nazis. Mandel worked hard from the beginning. Telephone fees increased daily, and the postal service accommodated 249 unemployed employees. Wartime and post-war France needed SVP's assistance even more. The number of employees is now five times that of the founding period, and now more than 10,000 calls come in and out every day.</p>
<p>The current director of SVP is Dekheim. They have a service slogan: "Simplify the lives of Parisians." Dekheim also made a contribution worth mentioning: during the war, he saw a patient being sent to the hospital lying on a wooden board, transported in a children's cart due to the lack of motor vehicles at the time. Dekheim felt compassion and came up with a passenger tricycle similar to the Shanghai rickshaw. The patient could lie in it, sheltered from the wind, and the seat was as comfortable as possible, thus alleviating many serious ailments and saving many lives.</p>
<h3>Clan Scholarships</h3>
<p>— Banana Heart</p>
<p>As the school term is about to end, education enthusiasts are launching fundraising campaigns for scholarships to encourage impoverished students to pursue their studies and cultivate national talent. The significance of this is profound, so we should adhere to the principle of "those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money," and work to the best of our ability to ensure that every impoverished student has the opportunity to attend school.</p>
<p>Every clan in our country has an ancestral hall, and sacrifices are invariably offered in the spring and autumn seasons each year. This is originally the meaning of "remembering ancestors and tracing origins," which I do not oppose. However, these spring and autumn sacrifices, in addition to ingot paper, also include sacrificial feasts. All those participating in the sacrifice can feast, from a few tables to ten or more tables. Each sacrifice costs hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan. Using the property accumulated by the blood and sweat of the ancestors to provide a feast for the descendants seems too unworthy. I believe that it is right for descendants to worship their ancestors, but observing the descendants going to the ancestral hall to worship ancestors, many are not "worshiping ancestors for the sake of worshiping ancestors," but "worshiping ancestors for the sake of eating." Therefore, I suggest that this "sacrificial surplus" be abolished and used as a clan scholarship. In every clan, there are rich and poor, and there are certainly many who want to study but cannot afford to. If every clan could do this, the number of impoverished students missing out on education would definitely decrease significantly; if the wealthy donate more, this serious problem of school dropout could be more than half solved. Instead of holding grand and ethereal sacrificial rituals twice a year, why not cultivate talent for the clan?</p>
<h3>Credit</h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A person cannot stand without credit." In fact, almost every transaction involving money is inseparable from credit. Sometimes, we pay the money to others first, and then get the service or item we need. Sometimes, we get the service or item first, and then pay the other party a corresponding reward. For example, going to the theater to watch a play and buying a train ticket belong to the former, while taking a rickshaw or going to a restaurant for a meal belong to the latter. Generally, the party with a higher credit standing can get the price or free enjoyment first. I often wonder if a ragged person goes to a famous and expensive restaurant to eat, would the waiters first ask him to pay a certain amount before allowing him to order?</p>
<p>Of course, judging a person's creditworthiness is not an easy task. Often, people with extraordinary appearances may make embarrassing jokes. According to an accountant who works in a dance hall, once a well-dressed gentleman tried to skip paying for his tea at closing time, sneaking away. He was caught by the waiters, who forced him to take off his leather shoes and let him take a rickshaw home to get the tea money before allowing him to redeem them. This seems like an inhumane fact.</p>
<p>Of course, we hope that everyone, even every country, can maintain good credit, saying one is one, and saying two is two. If we can truly achieve the day when, as the ancients said, "draw a line on the ground as a prison, and dare not overstep it," and countries only value trust and righteousness, then even if there are atomic bombs, they will have no use.</p>

<p>"Waiter," said the irate customer, "why is it that I'm paying the same price, but today's chicken is only half the size of yesterday's?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir," the waiter replied, "which table did you sit at yesterday?"</p>
<p>"On the window side."</p>
<p>"That's right, sir. We always give a bigger portion of chicken to the customers sitting by the window. It's the best advertisement."</p>
<h3>The Way of Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Several years ago, when Hollywood was filming a martial arts movie, the male lead had to jump from the wall of a fortress over a ditch and land on a stone step. It was too dangerous, so Hollywood surveyors were called in to measure it. "It's impossible!" he told the director after detailed measurement and calculation. He thought whoever jumped would definitely get injured.</p>
<p>The director was a rude and irritable man. He said, "Coward, what are you afraid of? I'll jump myself!"</p>
<p>So, he pulled the rope, jumped over the ditch from the wall of the fortress, and let go. As a result, he fell to the ground, injuring his back and legs, and stayed in the hospital for six months.</p>
<p>Based on this anecdote, now, when I criticize my wife's cooking, child care... etc., she never argues with me, but just says humorously, "Do you also want to pull the rope and jump yourself?" which immediately silences me. If she wants to blame me for earning too little, not hoarding and speculating, not doing stocks and gold, then I don't argue with her either, just smile and say, "Do you want to jump yourself?" – Honestly, a short joke is much more effective than arguing.</p>
<h3>Camera Catches Thief</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Recently, a couple in California, USA, were celebrating their wedding anniversary in a bar and invited a soldier in the bar to drink with them. When he accepted, a photographer who specialized in taking pictures for people in the bar captured this joyful scene. The soldier sat for a while, thanked the male and female hosts, and then got up to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Afterward, the photographer sent his photos. The hostess casually glanced at one and reached out to get money to pay for it, but her wallet was missing. After developing and enlarging the photo, it clearly showed that the thief was the visiting soldier.</p>
<p>This kind of thing happens often, which proves that the camera undoubtedly often becomes a first-class detective. In the hands of well-trained law enforcers, bringing criminals to justice, the lens is as effective as a pistol, because no evidence presented to the court is stronger and more powerful than this photo. Unlike human testimony, the camera clearly remembers every detail. And it often sees things that the naked eye overlooks.</p>
<p>When the police in a Midwestern town were looking for a mysterious bombing, they had reason to suspect a worker who lived in a town thirty miles away. But they couldn't find any evidence to blame him.</p>
<p>However, during the investigation, a piece of wood was eventually discovered, with a layer of blurred, newspaper-like imprints on it. The police knew that the force of an explosion often caused one object to imprint on another, so they decided to photograph the imprints on the wood with an infrared camera.</p>
<p>In the enlarged photo, the imprint was clearly readable. It was confirmed to be part of a story published in a newspaper published twelve hours before the explosion in the worker's residence. The police put their evidence in front of the suspect, and he had no choice but to plead guilty.</p>
<p>Although the camera often brings criminals to justice, it also protects the innocent. A woman was accused of murdering her husband. She pleaded that her husband's death was an accidental misfortune. She said that he came home drunk that day, she met him on the lawn, he pulled out a gun to intimidate her, and then the two struggled, and unfortunately the gun went off, shooting him to death.</p>
<p>The prosecutor mocked this defense, asserting that she was waiting for her husband in the hallway, and when he passed through the grass, she shot him through a screen door.</p>
<p>The defendant's situation seemed hopeless. At this time, her lawyer presented the jury with a small package of photos. They were all photos of fired bullets, only one of which did not have intersecting marks. This bullet was taken from the body of the defendant's husband. The other photos of the bullets were all shot through the screen door into an oak door – although the resistance of the oak door was greater than that of the human body, it still could not eliminate the marks on the bullet caused by passing through the screen door.</p>
<p>These photos proved the woman's innocence - because the bullet that killed her husband could not have passed through the screen door.</p>
<p>Filming is also a major witness in countless cases. The evidence it provides is as effective as ordinary cameras, and often more spectacular. For example, in 1942, when the Attorney General of Massachusetts wanted evidence to prosecute gambling fraudsters in Boston, he gave his investigators a batch of movie cameras and filmed them near the entrance of the gangsters' headquarters. When the case went to trial, a screen was set up in the court, and the prosecutor played the "movies" they had filmed, and the faces of the gangsters who entered and left the den every day suddenly appeared on the "screen." As a result, all thirty-three scammers were convicted.</p>
<h3>Collection of Jokes</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>A woman married her husband's brother not long after her husband died, and the neighbors criticized her a lot. But she did not forget her old feelings and hung a portrait of her ex-husband in the living room. The neighbors felt a little comforted, but one day they heard the following conversation:</p>
<p>A guest looked at the portrait and asked the hostess, "May I ask who that handsome person is?" The remarried woman replied, "Ah, him? He is my younger uncle, who passed away not long ago."</p>
<p>A nouveau riche decided to give his children the best of everything in the world. He sent his daughter to college. But his daughter's grades were poor, and she couldn't keep up with her classmates, so she was ordered to drop out. When the father asked her why, she frankly confessed that her talent was not enough, and she couldn't do the homework that other students could do. The nouveau riche waved his hand and said, "That's easy, I'll buy you some talent."</p>
<p>At a wedding ceremony, a friend of the groom decided to study whether the guests were really listening to the polite greetings between each other. He said to every guest who passed by him: "My grandfather died today."</p>
<p>The guests' reactions to this sentence were as follows: "Ah, that's great!" "Thank you!" "What you said is really interesting!" No one really knew what he was saying. The groom was even more confused. He replied with a smile, "You should take the same steps!"</p>
<p>Correction - In the article "Thinking of Yan Song" by Zhou Lengjun published in this magazine on the 23rd, Yan Song was mistakenly identified as a Song Dynasty person. The editor failed to notice this and did not correct it in a hurry. Fortunately, reader Ye Shouming pointed out the error in his letter. In addition to expressing deep gratitude to Hua Jun, we hereby correct it.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (52)</p>
<p>Qi Wan urged him several times, but Zhu Zhai had no results. Thinking that Zhu Zhai was an amateur in terms of real estate, she entrusted someone else. In a few days, she finalized a building on Fenfang Liuli Street. Without notifying Zhu Zhai, she waited until the payment, writing, and vacating the house were all done before telling Zhu Zhai. When Zhu Zhai heard that Qi Wan had already bought the house, he was stunned for a moment, speechless for a long time. Seeing him in a daze, seemingly disapproving, Qi Wan smiled and said, "Zhu, why don't you understand what I mean? I'm doing this for our own good. Isn't it more respectable if we buy a house and then get married? You propose a travel wedding, but I think it's too hasty. Since you divorced your wife, there's nothing legally wrong with you remarrying, so why should we be so compromising? Besides, marriage is a major life event, and it only happens once in a lifetime, so it has to be glamorous. As for all the expenses, I've budgeted for them, and I'm capable of bearing them all, so you don't have to worry. There's also a reason why I bought this house. The house I live in now was left by my father. It's okay for me to live in it, but I still think I have older and younger brothers, and they have to share equally. Now that I'm capable and can afford to buy a house, of course I have to buy one and give this one to my younger brother. That's the right thing to do. The house I bought is an old-fashioned building. You're an artist, full of artistic talent, and you can definitely help me. After you renovate it, it will definitely be beautiful. You don't have to worry about the cost, just strive for perfection." Seeing that Qi Wan had already settled the house, and what was done could not be undone, and seeing her so enthusiastic, Zhu Zhai had to obey her wishes and smiled, "You just told me to renovate it, but I don't even know what the house looks like." Qi Wan said, "The house is old-fashioned. It's hard to explain. I'll take you to see it now." After saying that, she put on her coat and went to Fenfang Liuli Street with Zhu Zhai. When Zhu Zhai saw the house, the facade was okay, but it was too old. After looking around, he asked, "What are your plans?" Qi Wan said, "I'm waiting for the artist to decide!" Zhu Zhai said, "I think this drooping flower gate should be removed first. It not only takes up space but also isn't aesthetically pleasing." Qi Wan nodded and said, "I also have this opinion." Zhu Zhai said, "Once the drooping flower gate is removed, the yard will look bigger, and you can plant more flowers and trees. The front building has five rooms upstairs, one as a bedroom, two as guest rooms, one as a study, and one as a bathroom. The five rooms downstairs will have three large living rooms and two dining rooms, which should be enough. The remaining six rooms in the east and west wings can be used for storing things, and the servants' quarters underneath should also be enough to distribute."</p>

<h3>Reader Mailbox</h3>
<p>▲To Mr. He Dekang: The recruitment information published in the journal comes from the Shanghai Vocational Introduction Office (No. 856 North Sichuan Road) and the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Office (No. 80 Hua Road). I hope that you will contact them directly.</p>
<p>▲To Mr. Huang Menrong: It is currently quite difficult to award additional awards. Since there is already a divided list, the apportionment of military expenses already has fairness. Based on the request, the excess quota has already been decided. The company's fine is naturally borne by the locals. Now that a dispute has arisen, it is clear that Ding does not understand the situation. It seems appropriate to inform him of the pros and cons and revise the apportionment ratio.</p>
<p>▲To Mr. Song Fuliang: Due to limited space, incoming manuscripts cannot all be published. Furthermore, it is very difficult to find someone who a friend wants to visit, even though they once served in the press, but their name is unknown. It is better to post an advertisement, which may be effective.</p>
