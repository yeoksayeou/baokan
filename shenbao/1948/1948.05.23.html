<h3>總統利用星期例假　考慮行政院長人選　召見王寵惠談憲法問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕行政院長人選，廿二日尚未經總統提出，張羣飛渝後，各方對何應欽之敦勸，均盡全力進行。滬市長吳國楨亦會來京敦勸，程天放，馬超俊等均先後往訪，孫科則於廿二日下午五時左右往訪，僅作一刻鐘之晤談後，孫氏即離去。何氏之辭意甚堅，雖經各方敦勸，亦未變更其原定之意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕頃自關係方面獲悉：新政院長人選，在張羣，何應欽兩氏先後堅辭後，總統於填重之態度下，將利用星期（廿三日）例假，作充分之考慮。並悉：可能在張·何兩氏之外，另提新人，至此第三者究爲何人，則尚無法探悉。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕王寵惠廿一日下午二時返牴滬時，此間已去電復召當乘夜車再度來京，廿二日上午七時到達後，甫經小憩，即由陳布雷陪同赴黃埔路官邱晉謁蔣總統，長談四小時，逾午始辭出。據王氏午後接見本報記者談稱：渠與總統所談者，以憲法問題爲主。渠謂：我國現行政制既非總統制，亦非內閣制，行政院長之地位，既不似美國之國務卿，亦不若法國之內閣總理，其與總統及立法院（議會）之關係亦各殊，是以憲法上若千特點，究之中外，俱史無前例，且憲法規定不免過於繁瑣，故需而要研究設計者至多。王氏極力避免涉及所談憲法問題之具體項目及其是否與目前大局或將來行憲政院即將遭遇之困難有關。渠不否認蔣總統會與談諭行政院長提名問題，然對廿一日晨國民黨籍立萎談話會之假投票事，則稱無所悉。關於未來行政院長人選，渠未指名論列，唯稱：必兩要件具備方可決定，第一爲總統提名，第二爲立院同意。至於被提名並經同意之本人之願出任與否，依情理度之，不應發生絕難解決之問題，否則即係違反公意，逃避服役，對國家未盡忠忱。至此，記者詢以倘渠本人被選擇爲行政院長，則將如何？渠笑謂：「余早已逾齡，自不應再被強迫服役，目前局面殊複難艱困，宜由年富力強者出而祖當重任」。至下午五時，王氏復訪陳布雷，並邀同孫科·吳鐵城晉謁總統，對於新任行政院長候選人人選有所商談，迄晚尚未聞有何決定。</p>

<h3>工業化與民生</h3>
<p>— 王遵明</p>
<p>只就本身來說，理想完善，是極可貴的。徜使缺乏達到　想的方法，未免美中不足，成了畫餅充飢，無補於當前的饑餓；若能想出實現的手段，逐漸接近這理想，不　　梅可以止渴，且要進入極樂境界。民主思想，便是如此。近一二百年，廣泛流行。追溯民主思想的淵源，遠在周秦之間，以及希臘數邦，早有了精關的說法。至於部分的實行，卻在十八，十九，二十世紀。這一二百年中，工業革命，正在逐漸完成。最初蒸汽，其後電，汕，和水力，增加了數十倍於人口的力量，也免除了人們大汗淋漓的辛苦。如何利川這應大的動力，則有千萬精細的紡錘，以至於巍巍然橫路大河的水閘。山海底至天空，由都市至沙漠，無不受了工業革命的影響。　昔不毛之地，今日麥浪如海。往時帝王始得享受的紫色，鮮荔枝，絲絨，刻下工業發達的國家裹，若干萬萬人都可享受。又如冬曖夏涼，昇空人海，萬里外的聲看狀貌，　然即在眼前，普通人民的這些日當生活，實非往時帝王所能經歷。至於近年發明的神妙醫藥，增加了幸福，沖淡了災禍，古代帝王寤寐求之以爲或存於海上仙山，想不到刻下就在身旁。</p>
<p>工業化革新了生產方式，於衣食住行諸端，各增加了百分之歡十以至於數百倍的財富。分配時有此雄厚憑藉，更容易公平，也便是趨近於民主的標準。革新的生產方式，減輕了疲勞，延長了閒暇，於是剩餘精力使用於當前生產之外的享樂和學問。適當的享樂蓄積了再生產時的工作效率。學問中所探討的是了解物和人的本質和關係。對於物，進一步的了解所闡明的，甚少牽涉到個人，因此建立客觀的是非；憑此公認的智識，促進了生產方式的再改進，將要繼續增加財富。對於人，進一步的了解，和自己有關了，往往利害掩蔽是非，因此引起糾紛，爭辯，搏鬥。然而蠱昨超出於利害，雲霧不能長久掩藏日月。工業化既賦予若干萬萬人以深刻思索和探討的機會，眞理便從錯誤和蒙蔽專露出頭角來。工業化之後，學問向大多數人開放了。智　上，平等了；分配方向，不得不公平了，也就是分配的標準，不得不民主了。從生產財富來說，工業化準備了民主的物質基礎；從分配財富來說，工業化確立了民主的要求。</p>
<p>不僅中國，全面工業化之前，英·美·德·俄的生活水準，都比較低微。在日常生活上，貧富的享受，顯然大有軒輊之分。當時英國的煤礦，普遵麗用着婦孺，每人負荷數十斤煤，匍匐蛇行於礦洞。即在二十餘年前，美國鋼鐵廠還是每班工人工作十二小時。隔一星期，日班夜班，相互更換。一個工人，半個月裹，每一天要工作二十四小時，這對於健康，妨礙不少。帝俄時，一般農民猶如地主的私產；國內使用着議照制度，多數農民不得自由脫離土地，法定了地主對農民的無情剝削。那時，英·美·德·俄一般人民住的不是鋼骨水泥的房屋，穿的不是乾凈整齊的綿毛；只有少數人，享用魚肉，乘坐車馬。這種情形，自然是不公平的，也是痛苦的。</p>
<p>可惜時至今日，我國的情形，還停滯在這種貧苦的境界。三十年前五四運動重新提出了民主的口號，也舉起了科學的旗轍。比之數千年來只講民主，是不同的。純粹科學探究眞理，建樹民主的哲學根據；應用科學發展生產，也便是工業化，促進民主的實現。實現眞理的方法，也許隨時代而急速改變；眞理的存在，卻亘萬古而不易。工業化之前，享受的分配，本該公平。工業化之後，供給公平分配的財富，卻更充足，要求公平分配的呼聲，卻更堅強。五四遝動以來，應用科學的表現，即工業的成就，還是不多。論鐵路，伸展有限；論河道泛濫成災　山　聞　林稀少；海洋上漁船寂寥。我國鋼塊產量和原油產量，比之美國的，不過萬萬分之歲。只少數都市，使用電燈，遠明暗不保·縱有民主的呼聲，物質憑籍貧乏，一般人不得不僑促於凍鐵的邊緣。極少數人貪圖享受，有的竟走到作奸犯科的瘋狂境地。雖然瘋狂如此，這些作奸犯科的人們，　幾個能夠獲得，現代工業國家一般人民的生活水準？惟有生產工業化，享受民主化，始可改進一般人民的生活。否則衆飢獨飽，衆寒獨暖，終究是近於於不可能的，也是不安寗的。三十年來十分嚴重的外患，無疑的，是我國工業化程度薄弱的主要原因；此外，缺乏工業人才和適常組職，也頗有關係。倘能排除一切障礙，全面工業化，在不久的將來，可有充分的財富，以供給合乎民主標準的公平分配，也就是達到經濟的平等。</p>
<p>隨全面工業化而來的，將不僅是財富的增加。工作分裂爲若干門類。一個門類分裂爲若干段落。每人只做一個段落，自然精巧了，也省辛苦了。全體的效　增加，相亙的倚賴加重。合起來產量有十倍，分開來毫無成就。思想也大量傳播。報紙，雪片似的繁密。無綫電，發濤似的洶湧。報紙和無綫電，傳遞了消忠，也集中了消息，提高了趣味，也劃一了趣味。個人的能力，固然增加；人與人問的連繫，愈趨嚴密。於是個人的自由，必須不超過合理的疆域。瞽如在荒野步行，任意舉足，所行不遠；在大街開汽車，謹慎駕駛，我頃百里。工業化加速的開放了閉關地帶，消滅了渺小國家。北極的雪地裹，愛斯基庫人不能蟄居了，天空中正飛行着轟炸機。南洋小島的椰十樹下，土人不能安坐了，畢基尼島正演習着原子彈。稍大的國家，如瑞士和瑞典，更不能超出於世界政局之外。一個國家的舉動，常影響及整個的世界。</p>
<p>工業化的結果：一個是衣食之類的蹩足，享受趨於公平；一個是交通之類的紛繁，組織趨於嚴密。前者發展了經濟的平等，後者調節了政治的自由。凡理想，要合乎道理，始能存在。自有生民以來，民主的經濟及政治，是最崇高的理想。由於工業化，民主理想獲得了實現的可能和範疇。</p>

<h3>招待京記者團晚會中　閻錫山一席談　剿匪完成後決自修五年</h3>
<p>〔本報太原航訊〕這次首都記者訪問團來并訪問，東道主閻錫山氏，在洗塵及餞行宴中，連宴前宴後，會與記者團作兩次五小時左右的無避忌的暢談。記者被邀作陪，借機得知若干有趣味的事情。</p>
<p>十六日晚會談中，有的同業問到孔祥熙先生會說過他在太谷原籍，有不少產業，他的土地是否也同樣爲實行兵農合一劃分了，在坐主辦兵農合一的薄右丞氏，當即答以關於他捐給學校和醫院的部份，是依中央對學校醫院公產的辦法處理，凡屬私產的都已劃分了，這是縣幹部處理的，實行兵農合一，從未考慮過誰的土地不該刪分這一問題。</p>
<p>另一位同業提出，山西有相當的治法，主要的是兵農合一的成就，如全國其他各縣也希望實行時，主任是否即可參加下屆總統競選？閻氏答以「競選問題，我未作考慮，我計劃剿匪完了後，留五年的時間，研究一點學問。政府交給我一百零六縣市，剿滅共匪，完璧歸趙，我才能對的起國家，對的起山西人民」。同業說，主任打算劊五年時閒求學，是否達反了主任剛才所說，服了公務，就不匯為自已讀書的主張。閻氏答以，「我今年六十六歲了，按國家規定，六十二歲就該退役，我覺得人生收穫，應有個純爭的結果，我劊這五年時間，是要淸理我自己的成份，這是造化的道理，不是在職而求學，是退職而自修。」</p>
<p>又一位同業說到在汾陽了解到人民的不滿，不是關於兵農合一本身問題，而是關於軍購糧差價的負祖問題。閻氏答以，「實行兵農合一，人民雖對軍購糧不滿，定能過的去，如不是實行了兵農合一，求得一個不滿，亦不可能，省參議會會向我提出，山西人民對軍購糧差價所受無理的負担，達九萬億元之鉅，幾乎超過國家抗戰八年，剿匪兩載所需法幣總額七分之一。說到軍購糧差價問題，人民已有時日曷喪予及汝偕亡的態度，這一問題，以山西和東北爲最嚴重，獲說東北已可大量空運糧食，是則以山西爲最困難了。</p>
<p>又有同業提出，聽說有個名醫檢查過主任的身體，說主任可以活到九十五歲。閻氏稱：「據醫生檢查我的肺，認爲特別強，如單以肺說，可能活到一百五十歲，但我感到，因爲肺好，反把大腸帶壞了。這也是個共同的作用，一件事壞了，即全身壞了。我從負責任以來，每年元旦，總要整理我的遺文，這項遺文，分爲三部，遺呈，遺令，和一個遺囑。</p>
<p>最後一位同業提出一個頗饒興趣的問題，他說：聽說閻先生夫人近才逝世，是否計劃娶一新夫人？這一句話剛出口，引起鬨堂大笑，閻氏婉爾容以「我沒有這意思。」我們這位同業繼續說，有一位夫人，也許能有許多幫助。閻氏　答：「我沒有感到有需要女人幫助的地方，我的家務是極簡單的，也不需要有人照料。一個長遠五小時不拘形式的會談，在夜十一鐘許，興盡歡散，離開了閻氏的實主一羣，直笑出了總署大應之外·（忠恕十七日發。）</p>

<h3>日貨銷港對南遷工業的打擊</h3>
<p>— 香港二十日航訉　本報駐港記者　子健</p>
<p>據港府方面。正式公布，本港對日貿易，去年共入超五百三十四萬美元，自從東京盟軍總部准許日貨以金鎊結賬後，日貨銷港激增，本年第一季內，本港對日貿易的入超，已達四百三十萬美元之鉅，日貨除由日本港口直接運港外，還有一種方法是由新加坡方面改頭換面充作美貨運進來，所謂「美國製造」的貨物，半數以上實在是日貨。港府批准從事對日貿易的商行，已由十餘家增至四十家以上，過去採辦美國貨的商行，現己改弦易轍，採辦日貨了。、</p>
<p>日貨大量傾銷的結果，首蒙不利的，就是戰後港中蓬勃一時的輕工業，尤以綿織業爲最。在過云數月間，被迫停業的棉織廠，計有七十一家，約佔總額十分之一。他如搪瓷業，電器業，玩具業，輕金屬製造業等，亦莫不受「廉價」日貨的嚴重威脅。中華港商聯合會有見及此，首先通電英倫政府，抗議容許日貨銷港的政策，港中其他經濟界人士亦一致嚮應，并有「反對日貨傾銷宣言」的發表。</p>
<p>香港工業的發展，既因日貨傾銷而岌岌可危，但以促進香港繁榮爲職責的港府當局，不特不設法阻止日貨的傾銷，反派專員常川來往東京香港問主持對日貿易的業務，據港中經濟觀察家意見，認爲其重要理由有二：（一）香港戰後成立的小工業，資方以暴利爲目標，工人的工資亦超乎正常水準，以致售價奇昂，歲與歐美貨物相埒，現在牠們面臨日貨的競爭，不得不降低利潤，減少成本，以謀對抗，這麼一來，市民反可購得比較便宜的日用品。（二）以日貨代替美貨，商人採購以英鎊結賬的日貨，而不採購美貨，即可減少港府對套得美元的消耗，這是對香港財政大有神補的。同時，港府爲倫教的輸出商預留一個地步，將來英國出品能夠大量供應遠東市塲，則英貨將可取日貨而代，以香港爲基地，大量向中國內地傾銷了（日貨輸港是受港府統制的）。</p>
<p>港府對已註冊和申請駐冊的工廠，每月發表一次公報。四月份，本港新增工廠三十六家，連前經已註冊的，共有九百八十八家。其中二百五十三家在香港，七百三十五家在九龍。四月份向勞工處由申請註冊的新廠，還有三十九家之多，其中有金屬製造廠和織造廠各七家，搪瓷總，紗廠，印刷廠各兩家。這和在日貨傾銷下工廠紛紛關門大吉的現象，成了一個強烈的對比，這是什麼綠故呢？</p>
<p>這個問題的解答，便要說回到國內的工業和游資注入香港的舊事了，當前那些如雨後春筍出現的新工廠，就是國內資金年內在香港所產生的成果，牠們籌設之初，想不到日貨可這麼快就會排山倒海而來，現在日貨既來，牠們已成強弩之末，欲罷既不能，祇得硬着頭皮幹下去，如有可能，且磨拳擦掌和日貨一爭長短吧。</p>
<p>國內的資金，眞的千不該萬不該爲了一時的便宜而投進香港來，那些「唯利是圖」的商人，現已開始「自食其果」了除了感受日貨的壓迫外，在港新成立的工廠，爲港中工資高漲所累，現已暗暗呌苦，南洋紗廠最近便以工人待遇問題而掀起一個哄動至港的工潮，名界人士對這個「資金雄厚，規模宏大」的由上海南遷的新紗廠，正式開工不及一月，竟宣佈罷工，眞有點「莫明其妙」，這也是出於那些傲然南下的國內資本家的意料之外的。</p>
<p>前幾天，據記者從可靠方面得悉，有幾個來自上海的富商，在香港因找不到房子，無法安身，一氣之下，憤然轉往廣州去了。這幾個富商眞是無法在港找得安身之地嗎？港中的華麗的旅館或新式公寓且不必說，就是他的富有的朋友的大府，也够也享用不盡，他們卻不顯而去，他們是有福了，這個「天堂」還是讓那些敗類「捷足先登吧」。</p>
<p>國內資金南移香港的另一「作孽」，就是把建國大業的活本錢，變成一塊外國殖民地裹的死地皮。這一年來不論是最繁盛的市中心區，抑或最僻靜的郊外（可作工產廠址的）的地皮，無不漲價十倍。這完全是南下游資爭購的結果。當日軍退出香港的半年問，香港的她波兩不動產一致走下坡路腹港府的「開發計劃」亦胎死，中，現在南下游資爭相購買地皮之下，港中移山填海的工程應運而起，偏僻的海灣，如香港方面的北角，九龍方面的土瓜灣，牛池灣，長沙灣等地，都已着手填爲平地，或作往宅區，或作工廠區，報上常常看到建設新香港的大計，打椿機的鐵鎚一下一下的衝擊土地的心房，使得業在大西洋岸的一部份人士，對這個原本蓄意「放棄」的小島，也不由不重溫他們美麗的舊夢了。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦現行局勢發展　英美關係尖銳化　英駐美公使訪晤洛維持　美要求根據聯合國憲章實施制裁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿二日廣播：消息靈通方面稱：美碉國務卿洛維特會與英方討論是否可依照聯台國憲章第七節在中東實施制裁。</p>
<p>〔路透吐華盛頓廿一日電〕英駐華盛頓公使貝爾福今日會與美副國務卿洛維特晤談一小時，使人愈益相信巴勒斯坦問題已使英美關係趨於惡化。華府盛傳杜魯門總統不久則將宜布解除對以色列之軍火禁運令，可能於安全理事會否決美國所提宣布巴勒斯坦局勢業已勢脅和平之決議案後即行預發，果爾，則將形成美國以軍火供給以色列，而英國則以軍專援助給予外約但之局勢。同時美國報紙之抨擊英國「參與」阿拉伯之戰者亦巳日見增多。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕此間人士深感巴勒斯坦之局勢將妨碍英美間之關係，英國在可能範國內當盡力避免英美在巴勒斯坦之戰中陷於對立之狀態。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿一日電〕巴勒斯坦問題已開始使英美間之關係趨緊張。雖朱迷到兩國提出正式抗議之程度，若英繼續援助阿拉伯國家攻擊聖地之猶人，則上述之事可能發生。私底下美英兩國業已互相指責。美國認爲英國以在中東之油田利益之遠長眼光來觀察聖地之戰爭，不顧阿拉伯之侵略，殺書猶太人。英國認爲美國眼光短淺，蓋美國境內猶人衆多能影響政治問題。迄至今日美英之破裂更形尖銳，美國已承認以色列國，英國則未加承認，英發言人並稱：在若干時期不致承認以國。如英美間攤牌，則杜魯門總統似將佔得優勢。蓋美國爲歐洲復興計劃付出金錢，此乃英國之經濟復興之最大希望。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕據可靠方而傳稱：副國務卿洛維特今日與英國一等參贊貝爾福爵士會談達四十分鐘。傳係討論巴勒斯坦局勢。貝爾福爵士試圖調和英美二國在安理會中之意見，但國務部未能作任何決定。此同一方面又指出英國輿論界不支持英政府之熊度，美政府則竭力避免援助以色列國，將使聯合國陷於僵局。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿一日電〕蘇政府機關報消息報廿一日斥責英國故意阻換巴勒斯坦問題之解決，以加強其在阿拉伯國家間之地位。該報並稱，英國對巴勒斯坦問題應該負責，現應支持聯合國之決議而負起此項責任，不應阻撓問題之解決。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿二日電〕英大使館官負頃否認美國通訊社所傳英國要求與美舉行會議，以解決英美就巴勒斯坦之糾紛之案。此一報告，顯然係因英駐美公使貝爾福昨訪美副國務卿洛維特討論巴勒斯坦問題後而誤傳。同時美國報紙，不惜以巨大篇幅，揣測英美將因巴勒斯坦而關係轉劣之可能性。關係方面相信，貝爾福之訪洛維特，意在避免於美國撤銷對以色列國軍火禁令，而英國則繼續支援外約但但軍之情形下，英美間所將發生的重大歧見。此等非正式之接觸，雖在繼續舉行，然尚未聞召開正式會議可以促成此項努力之建議。</p>
<h3>英曾否以美援資助阿軍　美參院將予調查　貝文告美大使英阿關係必須維持</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿二日廣播：英外相貝文今與美大使陶格拉斯談話，討論英天兩國對巴勒斯坦問題之異見。據外交界訊：英方已通知美國：英阿關係必須維持，以便阻止共產主義之南流。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕美參議院撥款委員會主席勃里奇廿二日稱，如國會發覺以歐洲復興基金之一部份，用以武裝阿拉伯軍隊，則國會可能削減英國應得之總額。渠稱，撥委會將調查英國資助與猶人作戰之阿軍之範團。</p>
<p>如發現英國有以美援資助阿方軍事行動之行爲，則國會之削減英國份下之十三億二千四百萬元，或爲「非常得當」。按復興歐洲基金已由國會通過，然尚須待參衆兩院撥款委員會通過，始能動用。參議員白魯斯特告參院稱，英國之所以保諾以八百萬元接濟外約但國王阿勃杜拉，蓋有美國經濟援助之故。因此勃里奇乃答應調查，而國會中亦有多人要求取消禁運軍火至中東之命令。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿二日電〕美國駐英大使陶格拉斯廿二日奉召訪問英外交部，與外相貝文會商巴勒斯坦問題。消息靈通人士稱，會議之所以發生，顯因華盛頓宣佈參院撥款委員會將調查英國會否以復興歐洲基金，用以資助參加巴勒斯坦戰爭之阿拉伯國家。</p>

<p>〔路透社喀拉基廿一日電〕數萬回教徒來自喀拉基之各地，今日齊集美大使館前示威，高呼打倒「美·蘇·猶軸心」。彼等並要求卸下美國旗，幸美大使艾林態度鎮靜，親自登陽台向示威者致辭，詳爲解釋，始未發生意外。今日經回民定爲「巴勒斯坦日」以示聲援阿拉伯族抗議美蘇之支援以色列，全市回教商店一律停業一天。</p>
<h3>聯合國斡旋專員定週四飛往聖地</h3>
<p>〔路透社斯德哥爾摩廿一日電〕瑞典紅十字會會長貝那多特伯爵，已表示願就聯合國巴勒斯坦斡旋專員之職。　氏告本社稱：「本人之接受此一任務，係因相信滅許尚有一綫成功希望之故。本人深知巴勒斯坦問題決非猶阿問之內部事件，乃爲足以導起大戰的火花。茍有一綫成功希望，尚值得一試。」貝氏並日：渠於接交此職前，曾電聯合國秘書長賴伊，請示該斡旋專員之地位，並聲明渠之試就此職，不能逾六個月，賴伊巳於廿一日下午有覆電致彼，告以渠有提出建議及採取行動的相當自由權。貝氏復曰：渠於下星期四即當飛往巴勒斯坦，在該地時將保留國際紅十字會官員之地位。</p>

<h3>美空軍擴至七十大隊案　總統簽署成法律</h3>
<p>但聲明保留動用額外款項之權</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕杜魯門總統今日簽署卅一億九千八百萬美元之添購新機案，但附加聲明稱，渠或不准動用國會爲開始建立七十大隊空軍而另加之八億二千二百萬美元。杜魯門發表聲明，表明渠之簽署此案，並非放棄其目下六十六大隊空軍已足之立塲。杜氏並稱，「國會已認爲除余認爲必要之數額外，應另加八億二千二百萬美元，但亦規定非經總統認爲「定購合同爲國防所必盡」，不得動用此款。美國之安全需要整個國防計劃，築於健全經濟制度之基礎上，並須視在以後數年內能負担之開支標準而定。此即余所以願實施此項法案條文之理由」。該案經總統簽署後，海軍部及空軍部諒將立即定購該案所規定之四千二百架新機中第一批新機，其中大部份殆係噴射式飛機。</p>
<h3>以色列通知安理會猶方願立即休戰　美促干涉聖地戰事案迄未表決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十二日廣播：以色列今通知安理會，謂猶万同意立即及無條件之休戰。又訊：據猶軍稱：今日阿軍向耶路撒冷舊城區進攻，均被擊退。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿二日電〕美國人士稱，美國可能於廿二日擊破英國之反對，而促令聯合國有力干涉巴勒斯坦戰爭。彼等預料聯合國安全理事會可能以七票必要之多數通過美國所提下令制止聖地流血之建議。</p>
<p>若然，英國亦不致使用否決權以阻撓多數決議。安理會星期六召集特別會議，希望能表決通過提案，以制止至少亦減輕猶阿之戰。然美建議通過之決定仍懸而未決。按美國前時幾已放棄通過其建議之希望，然加拿大·哥倫比亞及比利時三國突然表示與美國採一致行動。在蘇聯支援下天國岡促使安理會採堅決立塲，不惜以經濟制裁，甚至使用武力，以制止戰事。英國則在中國及可能其他兩國之支持下，希望能避免過於決絕之行動，而圖通過停戰要求，即使有一方遠抗，亦不擬予以懲戒。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿一日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯今日在聯合國安全理事會要求通過美國提案，採取強硬行動，制止巴勒斯坦戰事，勿再稽延。但安理會旋於下午會議討諭捷克共產黨政變問題，聖地一案何時付表決尚不可知。葛氏指斥英國所提和平調解方案不充分，謂英國現正公開援助外約坦，該國國王阿勃杜拉在英方支持下儼然成爲中東之現代凱撒。同時，敘利亞代表古里宣稱，美國原案主張飭令阿拉伯人停戰而不保護巴勒斯坦不實行分治，此點阿拉伯方面碍難接受。阿拉伯人將繼續反對分治與所謂猶阿國。</p>
<h3>澳北部沙漠中發現新金礦</h3>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕英美法裔比盧六國討論德國問題之會議，廿一日舉行全體會議，會後未不發表公報。然觀察家均信此一末次全體會之召開，係表示就國際管制魯爾及組織西德制憲議會等兩項問題，已獲有若干基本協議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿一日電〕外交界負責人土今日稱，英美法比荷盧山六國對於設立西德分時政府問題，已獲初步協議，一俟商定細則，下星期初即可正式公佈。六國決定於九月一日左右召開西德制憲議會，草擬西德國憲法。英美法三佔領國對於有關出口貿易，貨幣與外交政策等，保有否決權。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕官方發言人聲稱：德境英美當局不久將不經由四強協定而逕自實行金融改革。德國事務部發言人稱，此項改革當於夏季或秋季實行，屆時現有之鈔票將予收回，而以新鈔票代替之。除此改革外，間時並將實行資本附加稅。發言人又稱，此次改革將加強聯合佔領區之幣制。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕英法美政府對於西德三佔區同時實行金融改革已完全同意，其實行日期未經宣露。據負責方面之意見，今夏之前不致實行，擴張改革至西歐三國所佔之柏林區域問題尚未解決。按德國金融改革乃於數月前開始談判，蘇聯初亦參加，後忽退出。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕阿拉伯方面宣稱，阿拉伯軍團業己幾乎掌握整個耶路撒冷。而台拉維夫發表之以色列公報承認耶城內外之猶軍，處境嚴重，阿拉伯軍團之砲火殊爲猛烈，耶城全區尚爲猶軍佔領之各戰略要點，悉爲其轟炸目標。同時，埃及陸軍推進神速，已抵耶城南四哩之處，即可與阿拉伯軍團會師。耶路撒冷區之十萬猶太人，糧食水源，均告斷絕，士氣一蹶不振。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕巴勒斯坦之戰業已進入第六日，綜台猶阿兩方及中立方面之報告，所得最近戰況如下：南綫埃及軍；埃軍進攻迦薩北十哩處之雅特莫特凱猶太區，爲猶軍擊退。埃軍大砲亦轟炸迦臨北埃軍前綫司令部附近之狄爾哈思。東路佔領皮爾許巴後之埃軍，尚未聞有重要進展。外約但之公報復日：死海迤北之波達許工廠及附近各猶太區，不聽外約但軍團之勸降警告，且復自行縱火，因此外約但軍已進佔此等地區。東北綫約但河沿綫：外約但·伊拉克·敘利亞之飛機均出動掩護作戰及襲擊猶方陣綫。而以色列空軍，於二十日首次出動於迦列里職場後，廿一日未見活躍。</p>

<h3>南韓未具有保安力量前　美駐軍不擬撤退　南韓新國會本月內召集</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城廿二日電〕南朝鮮現已開始編組國際警備隊，並已開始在各地擴大微募隊員，韓人十八歲以上廿五歲以卞者均可應徽。此項國際警備隊乃準備於美軍撤離南韓時，担任國防工作之武力。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕美政府官員廿一日稱美軍撤離南韓後，如朝鮮新政府向美國要求，則「大批」美軍事經濟政治顧問仍擬留駐南韓。彼等稱，此批顯問中，若干係美政府公職人員，若干則係韓政府所聘請之美國平民。</p>
<p>同時美官員強調稱，雖美國決定自南韓撤退陸軍眷屬，至於美佔領軍之撤退，則尚無確切之計劃。蓋撤退計劃有視乎數因素：第一，韓人需時多久，始能使新政府發揮功能，並設置適當之保安武力。第二，聯合國臨時朝鮮委員會究竟將提出何種建議。第三，國際局勢之普遍趨向。此間官負希望朝鮮政府能於八月一日前發揮功能。同時國務院官員估計新政府成立後，美駐漢城之外交人員數在三五十人之間，然彼等亦稱另外亦有美人駐漢城。僉料推行朝鮮政府可望要求美軍事顯問團協助發展保安軍隊事務。</p>

<h3>對美國扶植日本政策　英反對情緒濃厚　提高日工業水準尤感威脅</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕關於日本賠賞間題，自美陸次屈拉普報告書提出後，各方反對情緒頗高。在遠東委負會中，英代表對於美方此項提案亦表示反對之態度。英代表意見認爲賠償間題，雖非專以限制日工業水準爲目的，但維特日工業水準而超過自給之態度，則絕不能容忍。英代表表示在遠東委員會中，應依大多數國家之意見來決定日工業水準，由日工業水準來決定日本賠償問題。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕天貿易協會預測將來世界綿鐵。即聯出國家中，日本將可居第三位。惟依最近國際反對美扶植日本政策情形下，將來日對外貿易是否可照美國計劃進行，尚屬疑問。</p>

<h3>美青年男女兩人　自共區輾轉來滬　曾服務國際和平醫院年餘　藥物缺乏泥土亦成代替品</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本埠二十二日訊〕美國青年男女二人，留居共區十四個月，現已由陝北跋涉長途二千餘里來滬。女名更丹萊，爲一護士，男名邁爾斯，爲一醫學人員，同於去年三月抵延安，兩星期後，即隨共軍撤退，在外人捐款設立之「國際和平醫院」中服務。兩人此次步行及乘騾車約十星期，始抵天津南面之國軍區域，轉道來滬。據稱：中共反對美國援華政策仍烈，華萊士之演說則在報中大登特登，至對美國個人頗受優待，行動不予限制。現在共區之醫學人員，尚有英國人許士婦夫，及新西蘭人克立福，皆安好無恙。二人服務之醫院，即爲自延安撤出兩醫院之一，地點在下白塔。爲便利及安全起見，全院分作四組。病人大都爲傷兵，惟藥品方面缺乏配尼西靈，磺胺類藥及石膏。院中設備殊爲簡陋，手術室爲一個粉飾之窰洞，窗用透明穗欛，手術臺係兩個木箱搭成。施行手術，多在日間，以節省用油，夜間祗有植物油或煤油燈照明。手術用品亦常用他物替代，如以蔴油代凡士林，烘乾之泥土代滑石粉，以製成DDT混合易。其地農民食物尚見充足。疾病以斑疹傷寒，回歸熱及癆病爲最猖獗。兵士多係頭部及臂腿受傷，每星期須施行手術多起。史丹萊女士擬於六月間回國，邁爾斯將留居上海。</p>
<h3>戲院種籲保障　當局力謀防止　榮軍移駐郊外　設法早日遣離　建議中樞暫弗繼續送來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近本市若干戲院劇場時遭武裝之人騷擾，如搗毀場地，歐打職工等事，層出不窮，全市所有戲院劇場日前特聯合向當局呼籲，請求予以切實保障。記者昨走訪治安當局負責人，詢以有無切實辦法杜絕此風，據談：最近一再發生之軍人騷擾戲院事件，肇事者多係過境之榮軍，彼等久經沙塲，爲國作戰而招致殘疾，現被遣送回籍，過境時，目睹都市聲色之盛，欲進戲院觀劇則被拒於門外，因此乃由憤懣而造成越軌行動，在軍紀上固屬不當，在情理上發有可愿。現爲防止此後發生類此事件，除與過境部隊事先取得聯絡，預爲接洽指定娛樂塲所，供過境士兵觀劇外，關於最近來滬之榮軍八百餘人，已集中移駐郊區龍華附近，囑其官長嚴加約束，並設法早日遺離。師管區司令部並已急電中樞，請在本批榮軍未離滬前，暫時勿再繼續送來，同時積極方面向當局建議今後所有軍人之還送，勿以上海爲轉口，以免刺激士兵心理而引起糾紛。聞中樞已在考慮中，或即可採納實行。至於本地駐紮部隊及傷兵之娛樂問題，以前業已商妥由各戲院輪流招待，士兵每星期可觀劇一次，論理當不致再有額外越軌舉動，否則決予嚴懲云。</p>

<h3>「送子觀音」大會集　祝助產士公會第三屆大會</h3>
<p>— 麗春</p>
<p>本市有彼人們喻爲送子觀音的助產士一千五百餘人，在理事長謝能女士領導之下，於二年前就已有了堅強的組織，——上海市助產土公會——會務推行，已有顯著成續。每個會員的資歷，均經嚴格審查，不但要有助產學校的畢業證書，還須有衛生部之助產士體書。這千餘會員，年輕者大多服務於公私立醫療機關，年長者大多自己開業，分佈在本市每個角落，整天整夜在爲婦嬰的安全而忙碌着。本市每日數百嬰兒的出世，全由他們辛苦中得以成長。他們不但是孕婦的救星，還是民族的保姆啊。</p>
<p>他們都有服務熱忱，職業信心，不論嚴多酷暑，白天黑夜，隨時應產婦的呼召而得立刻去執行母子二代安全的任務，——接生——有時夜間爲接生而失去睡眠，但白天尚須負責孕婦的產前產後檢查，嬰兒的預防接種等工作，求一刻休息，絕少機會。故往往因生活無定而影響於健康的很多。致於娛樂應酬，更是沒有機會。助產名爲自由職業，實在是一個極不自由職業，他們把一己的自由，都犧性在婦嬰身上，而換得婦嬰的安全了。</p>
<p>他們偉大的精神，實在令人佩服，雖是政府對他們並不擾待，公立醫療機關待遇之低，個人生活尚不夠維持，可是他們祗是埋首苦幹，從沒有向長官有所請求，因爲他們但求將所學貿獻於社會，華生精力盡瘁於婦嬰，在社會上他們自有崇高的地位。</p>
<p>今日是助產士會第三屆會員大會之期，願寄以遠大之期望，希望政府對助產士公會予以特殊協助，使能建立一更堅強的基礎，更希望謝理事長本以往堅毅的精神，領導全體會員，拯救吾全市苦難中的婦嬰，同登慈航。</p>

<h3>桐油豬鬃市況堅挺　鬃業危機伏亟宜獎勵增產</h3>
<p>中信局頃發表一週來桐油豬鬃市況如次：本週國外桐油市況繼續堅挺，紐約現貨每磅美金二五分，合C&amp;F價二四分，成交甚多。油漆廠存底漸稀，極欲買進。六七八月期貨市面，頗形活潑。香港油價相宜，每司馬担僅港幣一四五·五〇，故倫敦價路低。桶裝油每長噸CIF英鎊一七九鎊。國內市價計重慶每市祖一一·二〇〇·〇〇〇元，萬縣一二〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，漢口一三·七〇〇·〇〇〇元，上海一五〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，廣州一五·九〇〇·〇〇〇元，梧州一六，〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。本週國外豬鬃市況堅俏，惟中國供應稀少，革國進口商及製刷廠初以爲我國外匯政策即將改變，改變後中國囤貨將大量運美。豬鬃在美售價即可降低，數月來均不敢大量進貨，僅求足敷應用。現已發覺我國供應數量減少，及外匯管制辦法亦難變更，故急求補進。但國內以匯率關係，川口不敷成本，鬃廠僅求　存熟貨，以保持幣值。而對於收購生　增產，則不感興趣。此乃豬鬃業一大危機，而關係外匯收入至巨，亟宜獎勵增產，以免國外製刷廠因原料中斷而採用代用品。另一方面豬鬃國外售價太高，亦非良好現象，　欲維持豬鬃銷路，必須使代用品無法侵入。目前國外市價計重慶二七號黑配鬃C&amp;F紐約每磅美金二·六五元，漢口一七號黑配鬃三·八元，上海一七號黑配二·三五元，天津大五五箱黑配鬃九兀，小五五　黑配鬃五·九元，均頗高昂。</p>

<h3>美政府將統制輸出　實行公平分配物資</h3>

<p>總統在演說甲，將染本人在農塲上之靑年時代生活與今日之生活作一比較。杜魯門於其向憶其本人之幼年時談稱：渠會如何於淸晨起身，榨取牛奶，勢柴　生火，以助其母氏準備早餐。渠議笑稱：「當余爲如君等年齡之幼童時，余需日夜榨取牛奶，君等走入後廓取得一杯牛奶，並不知其來自何處。」渠繼嚴肅談稱：「現時吾人生活於原子時代，此一時代或指人類之毀滅，或指歷史上之最大機會。余希望余可通過此一時代，而君等將於余辭世之後面臨此一時代。自今而後，芙國將由年少如君等者領導，美國政府應努力使此一時代造成世界之福利與相平而不造成其毀滅。此即吾人全體工作之　標——世界上之和平。」</p>

<h3>向台灣健兒致敬</h3>
<p>— 丁榮觀</p>
<p>「靑天白日滿地紅，國旗　揚歌聲雷動，台灣健兒獻身手，新台灣，新英雄，洗　東亞病夫，強國必先強種，銀練成壯健的身體，這才是國家的主人翁！」</p>
<p>——台灣健兒參加全運會歌。</p>
<p>雄極一時的七屆全運大會，已經閉幕了。迎日來風雨述綿，江灣道上已　得一片凄淸，大有人去塲空之概！在這次的全運會中，固然發生了一些可憾的　惡的事情，但另一方面，也未嘗不使我們見到可喜的光明面。旬日之中，大會近廿項男女田徑游泳耙錄的打破，固是極輝煌的成續，即就大會參加的單位來說，南方有遠涉重洋，不遠千里而來的僑胞，北方也有歷盡艱苦，冒險犯難而來的戰區選手，就充分表現了團結一致的情神。而其中最使我們欽佩，而且最發生了示範作用的，是台灣健兒的作風。</p>
<p>台灣是我國首先渝陷敵手的國土，四十年來，他們嘗盡人間的苦楚，現在乍歸祖國，我們祗覺得悲喜交集！而他們的堅忍，守法的美德，更使我們萬分感動。在這次全運大會中，他們整隊而來，原隊而出，運動之前還要舉行短時問的柔輕體操，有始有終，十餘日如一日，確使我們耳目爲之一新。這樣有紀律，講羣育的隊伍，難怪比賽起來屢奪錦標了。老實說，要是沒有台灣健兒的參加，這次的大會的成績眞不知要遜色多少！再說，體育的精神，本來就在於紀律的表現，他們的守規則，服從，即捨優秀紀錄而不論，就已是絕端圓滿的成功！大會閉幕後，台灣省參加全運男女選手一百十八人，十七日離滬到杭州觀光，翌日杭州報紙記載台灣健兒蒞杭的消息，中有：「車於十一時五十五分抵達城站，選手均衣黑呢上裝，白色西褲，左臂有綠色盾形臂章，繡一黃色「台」字，各擕簡單行李一件，順次下車後，自動列隊，魚貫出站，秩序之良好，頗引起站上行車人員及同車旅客等之驚異。負責招待之中國旅行社杭社經理沈慕蓮亦認爲該社招待如此人數衆多之團體，本年尚屢首次，而秩序井然，不勞渠等操心者，則爲空前所無！」（見五月十八日杭版東南日報。）自勝利以來，國人不講秩序已成風氣，十餘年前朝氣蓬勃的「新生活運動」殆巳不可再見，頹風之不振，無過於今！我們想　於一等強國之列，就非有一等大國民的風度不可。我們必須講求團結，大家組織起來，還動是最能訓練這一種精神的，希望能因這次台灣健兒的表現，爲國人講究體育注重公德的開始，實爲萬幸！</p>
<h3>張之洞斃婦志疑</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>昨閱自由談鄭逸惟先生、「張南皮一怒斃婦之謎」一文，彼在「人物品藻錄」一書中，會記南皮斃婦事；既得廣州江世堯來函，按諸南皮年譜，謂絕無其事，鄭先生因亦自疑其立說之或不實。鄭先生所據爲坊間出版之「張之洞家書」，余亦嘗見之，確有語及斃妻事，絕不似偽造。而會孟撲所著孽海花說部中，亦隱射其事，描寫之洞之行爲，至爲　　，陳石遺師作之洞傳，謂；之洞軀幹短小，不類北人，廣　偉　，目三　有光，修　及腹，刻劃其形，不無微詞；其私德之不　，盡在人口，燕老人亦嘗語我；　海花所述未嘗過甚其詞也。之洞作悲懷詩（自注悼亡室　州石氏）五首，茲錄其第三首第五有兩首云：「酒失常遭執友　，韜精喜效閉關人；今朝又共荊高臨　，枕上何人諫伯倫？」「空房冷落樂羊機，　世年年悟昨非。鄉道房謀輸杜斷，佩腰何用覓弦韋。」悔悟之意，情見乎詞。江君　諸張氏年謂，謂爲不實，是發重加考議，且必推測其傳聞之由來。惜案頭無書，俟借得張文襄全集後，償別爲文論定。鄭先生盍亦有意於此乎？</p>
<h3>巧合</h3>
<p>— 玎玲</p>
<p>英國一個名　赫寗的鐵商，在一七三八年和英王喬治三世同日同時出生。赫寗開業的那一天，剛好就是喬治三世即位之日。兩人又在同一天結婚，同生九男六女。最後，兩人同在一八二〇年一月二九日同一時刻死去。</p>
<h3>女人與錶</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>假如太太小姐們都不用鋲，世界各地的鐘鋲店的修理生意一定要慘遭打擊。這不是說女人用錶的比男人多，而是說女人的錶比男人的容易壞。但是，這又不是證明女鋲製造得簡陋，實在是由於她們使用得不當。</p>
<p>從紀錄上看來，女錶壞的次數至少比男銨多一倍。據紐約「鑽器工會」研究的結果，他們設：「女子的皮包是壞錶的禍根。」這番判斷是權成性的。直到現在還有不少婦女把她們的錶放在皮包裹——甚至手錶也是如此。而皮包同時也是香水，撲粉，腦脂，捲烟和其他難物的藏身之地。香水就是眞正的　根之一。</p>
<p>各種香水都含有容易揮發的油質。揮發出來的油質混難了皮包中的粉曆和其他的塵埃，無孔不入的四散開來，錶雖然蕓得緊寗，但是難以抵得住「油灰」的「鑽營」，它們一鑽進錶內，就會障礙機器的活動，於是錶就停了。</p>
<p>雖然一個女子在游泳，洗澡或者在操做洗滌工作的時候，都小心的把腕上的手錶脫下來，可是，她卻不能擔保她的手錶不生銹。下廚房時，菜鍋裹和茶壺中噴上來的水蒸汽都會鑽進銨內，並且迅速的凝結起來，結果使銨生了銹。還有，錶中機器的樞軸上都途有一層薄薄的油，在通常的狀況下這層油可以支持一年光景。但是，每逢到接近熱度一次，譬如在爐旁烹調，錶內的油便乾掉一些，　軸的磨擦力因而增大，錶的壽命也就因而促短。—不過，假如有任何一位女士看了這篇文章而嚇得不敢下廚房，部實在大可不必，筆者在這裹所貢獻的忠告是：在下廚房時，不要戴錶。</p>
<h3>裁員聲中</h3>
<p>— 孫鶴</p>
<p>聽說政府要在行憲以後繼續在各省市裁汰駢枝機關及裁員，這在政府是賢明的措施，簡政節帑，無可非議。但在被裁的人員，卻不能不是一個間題。</p>
<p>從被裁者方面講：有人在申訴裁者不公平，有的則提出他自已的考績，證明不該裁，裁的原因是人事上無辦法。對於這，筆者認爲還是另一問題。姑且假定全部公平，被裁汰的大抵都是工作不力的吧，也還有歲點值得考慮。</p>
<p>一是這些公務員爲什麼會工作不力？荒嬉恬逸麼？則荒嬉恬逸要有荒嬉恬逸的環境。倘有，也不該他們負責·—老實說：在今天，多數公務員大抵救死不滬，能把仰事俯蓄的問題解決了是無上之福，還有工夫貪逸樂麼？再坦白些說：生活不安定，梄梄皇島，忙於借貸或想法子倒是事實。那末，生活不安定的人紫興使他失業，乾脆則乾脆矣，但這些人潰是活下去不活下去呢？</p>
<p>關於這些被裁的人，領了少數遺散費之後，到那裹去呢？不外三途：一是再到別的機關找工作去。那末，還是回到政府來，與其讓他去暗中摸索，何如統籌安插呢？一是在這社會混下去，用些不正當的方法來樓持一家生計，這個大概不需我們下斷語了。一是想法子做生意，做生意的人已經太多，莫非我們還要養成些生意人來發展商業麼？其是非我想也無需多說了。</p>
<p>總之，在動員戡亂期間而有多餘無用以致投聞置散的公務員已是「奇跋」，而正在政府工作着的人却會遇到失業，是不是動負得太多，已經過剩了？</p>
<h3>也談寫作習慣</h3>
<p>— 國平</p>
<p>馬克吐溫喜歡睡在狀上寫作。有時候當他半睡醒而得到了靈感後，來不及取紙張，立刻將頭邊的一枝顏色筆把主要的文字寫在枕套上面，因爲躺擱了時間會忘得一乾二淨。因此馬克吐　最愛　，他以爲　是世界上最好的東西。</p>
<p>契　夫要寫任何東西之前，總把所見聞到的　錄在一本小日記簿上，他不喜歡虛構小說，萬不得巳時當然例外。</p>
<p>英國十九世紀末葉的航海小說家傑克·倫敦每寫一部小說時，總是在一年以前便將該故事的內容的章節次序都預定好，然後每天不間斷地寫，每日大概由一千字起至二千字。</p>
<p>寫童話的安徒生喜歡立着寫文章，因爲他患有昏厥病。站着寫作時如果昏過去的話，可以砰的一聲倒在樓板上，使樓下人聽到，不然的話，就會沒有人來教他。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>國代大會集全國各地各族於一堂，人數既多，而聚合有法定之期限，故於會場之正式聚集之外，更有各種聯戳之會，以作紀念，甚盛事也。按舊時都市，政商學各界亦萬方人士所會，例有同年之會，同鄉之會，同學同業等會，以爲從面之聯絡，以敦特誼。惟聞此次國代又有「同性」懇親之舉，是爲創格。蓋昔之國會議員及各署官員皆爲一「性」所專，今則爲兩「性」所共，而女性仍爲比較的少數，則增此一會，亦屬當然應有之義。</p>
<p>國大之主席壇上，會有數次輪到女代表主席，據平津各報電訊，皆盛述她們熊度溫和而維持秩序甚有條理，此事雖不必邀然武斷爲女勝於男，竇足以資男性之反省！默察北地歷屆大會塲「噓！噓！」奇突之聲，「炮！炮！」之大放而特放，率皆起於男性之座中，女座大都靜穩，對此等奇聲異狀，僅付一笑。不知南京此次會塲情形如何，想亦不能例外。請問身臨其境之出席及旁聽諸君，堂堂代表之羣，巍巍國大之席，以一噓」爲能事者，男乎？女乎？　非「噓」不能顯示男性之一拿手傑作」乎？吾又聞之，有男代表以會場秩序太不佳，怪聲之外，時有越軌言動，議設「紀律會一，以司糾彈，並主張以女代表爲執行者，此語雖會引起一部分無意識之笑聲，然實非隨便之戲言，足爲男性內　於心之返映。女性之遜於男性者，「噓一聲而已，「炮」聲而已。守法執法，則未必不如，或且勝於男也。</p>

        <h1>1948.05.23</h1>
<h3>President Uses Weekend Holiday to Consider Premier Candidates, Summons Wang Chonghui to Discuss Constitutional Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The selection of the Premier has not yet been proposed by the President as of the 22nd. Following Zhang Qun’s flight to Chongqing, all parties are making every effort to persuade He Yingqin. Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen has also come to Nanjing to urge him. Cheng Tianfang, Ma Chaojun, and others have visited him successively. Sun Ke visited at around 5 PM on the 22nd for a brief conversation of only fifteen minutes before leaving. He Yingqin's intention to resign remains firm, and despite the urging of various parties, he has not changed his original decision.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] It has just been learned from informed sources that after both Zhang Qun and He Yingqin firmly declined the position of new Premier, the President, with a heavy heart, will use the weekend (23rd) holiday for thorough consideration. It is also understood that it is possible to propose a new candidate from outside the Zhang-He duo. However, the identity of this third person remains unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] When Wang Chonghui returned to Shanghai at 2 PM on the 21st, he had already received a telegram here recalling him to Nanjing on the overnight train. After arriving at 7 AM on the 22nd and resting briefly, he was accompanied by Chen Bulei to Huangpu Road to meet with President Chiang Kai-shek. They spoke at length for four hours, only departing after noon. According to Wang's interview with our reporter in the afternoon, his discussion with the President focused on constitutional issues. He stated: "Our country's current administrative system is neither presidential nor cabinet-based. The position of the Premier is neither like the US Secretary of State nor like the French Prime Minister. His relationship with the President and the Legislative Yuan (Parliament) is also different. Therefore, some specific aspects of the constitution are unprecedented, both in China and abroad. Furthermore, the constitutional provisions are inevitably too cumbersome, thus requiring extensive research and design." Wang studiously avoided mentioning the specific items discussed regarding constitutional issues, or whether they were related to the current situation or the difficulties the future constitutional government was about to encounter. He did not deny that President Chiang discussed the nomination of the Premier, but claimed to know nothing about the straw vote held at the KMT Legislative Committee member meeting on the morning of the 21st. Regarding the future Premier candidate, he did not comment on specific names, but stated: "Two essential conditions must be met before a decision can be made. First, the President's nomination, and second, the Legislative Yuan's approval." As for whether the nominee, once nominated and approved, is willing to take office, in light of reason and sentiment, there should be no insurmountable problem. Otherwise, it would be a violation of public opinion, an evasion of duty, and a failure to serve the country with loyalty. At this point, the reporter asked how he would react if he were chosen as Premier. He smiled and said, "I am already past the age limit and should not be forced into service again. The current situation is particularly complex and difficult, and it is appropriate for someone young and energetic to step forward and assume the heavy responsibility." At 5 PM, Wang visited Chen Bulei again and invited Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng to meet with the President to discuss potential candidates for the new Premier. As of the evening, no decision had been announced.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun, Concurrently Governor of the Central Bank, Takes Office Tomorrow; Zhang Jia’ao Arrives in Shanghai to Handle Handover Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Finance Minister and concurrently Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing. When reporters visited Mr. Yu in the evening, he personally received them, but declined to comment on the current financial and monetary situation, only stating: "Substantial material will be released next Monday (24th)." It is also learned that Zhang Jia'ao returned to Shanghai by train last night from Nanjing, and the new and old governors will complete handover procedures on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our City Report] Finance Minister and concurrently Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd from Nanjing. He was accompanied by Chen Nazhai, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, Sang Xiqing, Director of the General Affairs Department, and Huang Zuyao, Secretary. After a brief rest, Mr. Yu went to the Jianghai Customs Building to meet with Zhang Fuyun, Director of Customs and Excise, Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs, Shi Shouchang, Director of the Goods Tax Bureau, Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Bank, Shen Xirui, Director of the Business Bureau, Li Lixia, Director of the Gold Management Bureau, and Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuance Bureau, and Chen Gongliang, General Manager of the Central Printing Plant, to provide instructions on supervising financial controls in the Shanghai area. It is understood that Mr. Yu expressed his unchanged support for the current policies of Governor Zhang Jia'ao, such as tightening credit and selling materials. He will not only maintain the status quo but also strengthen them. It is also understood that there will be no changes in the personnel of the Central Bank, as Mr. Yu once held the position and many senior officials are former subordinates. Furthermore, the bank is a business organization with established regulations in each department, so the change of governor will have no effect on the business side.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] After Zhang Jia'ao's resignation as Governor of the Central Bank was approved, he returned to Shanghai by train at 4:30 PM on the 22nd to meet with the new Governor Yu Hongjun to discuss handover matters.</p>
<h3>Wu Guozhen Returns to Shanghai, Denies Taking Up a New Position</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Arrives in Shanghai on the Same Plane</p>
<p>[Our Report] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, responding to a telegram from the President the night before, traveled to Nanjing with Dr. Wang Chonghui. Yesterday, at the invitation of Guangdong Chairman Song Ziwen, he originally planned to return to Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane, but the plane experienced mechanical failure during takeoff. He then switched to the President's special plane, the "Meiling," which took off at 3:45 PM and landed at Longhua Airport in the city at 5 PM. After disembarking, they returned to their private residences to rest. There were rumors that Mayor Wu's summons to Nanjing was related to his taking up the position of Vice Premier or Foreign Minister. Mr. Wu denied this, saying, "That is 100% inaccurate. I will not be leaving Shanghai for the time being." During the meeting, the President inquired in detail about the recent price situation, public security, and economic issues in the city, and gave some instructions. He also instructed Mr. Wu to assist Governor Yu Hongjun in stabilizing the city's finances and preventing fluctuations during the period before the new cabinet is formed and the new and old governors of the Central Bank hand over.</p>

At 10 AM, Zhang, accompanied by Counselor Zhou Junliang, took a car to tour the main roads in the northern district and the Peace Tunnel. When he climbed the Victory Monument, he counted the stone steps, looking very relaxed. When the car drove to Linjiang Road, he even got out of the car to ask an old woman selling dried tofu how much it cost, and after hearing that it was six thousand yuan a piece, he repeatedly said, "Much cheaper than Nanjing!" At 12 PM, he had lunch at his brother Zhang Li's (Director of Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau) residence and visited his sick mother. Then, he went out to visit General Pan Wenhua, who is still sick. Yang Sen hosted a banquet in the evening.

If his wish is fulfilled, he will continue to serve in the central government, as a transfer to local work is currently impossible.</p>
<h3>National Army Pursues and Suppresses on the Ping-Sui Line; Recovers Yanqing City in Victory; Annihilation Battle to Unfold on the Outskirts of Chengde</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The bandits who invaded Kangzhuang on the Ping-Sui Line were repelled on the morning of the 22nd. The National Army pursued and suppressed them in victory, recovering Yanqing by evening.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] Bandit Suppression Headquarters reports: The Nie's unit, one vertical column that invaded Kangzhuang on the Ping-Sui Line, was defeated and fled north.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] There is still no major battle on the outskirts of Chengde. Longhua was fiercely attacked on the night of the 21st but was quickly repelled.</p>
<p>[Our Chengde Dispatch, 21st] The war situation in western Rehe is about to change, and an annihilation battle will soon unfold on the outskirts of Chengde. President Chiang telegraphed military and political leaders here yesterday, instructing them on the proper measures and ordering the rapid expansion of the North China and western Liaoning aid-Rehe troops, attacking from both sides, along the Ping-Gu and Jin-Gu lines.

<p>[Another Dispatch] The bandits invading western Rehe are being transferred from Siping, Zhangwu, Fuxin, Chaoyang and eastern Hebei, with an actual strength of about 40,000 to 50,000. Their attack preparations have been preempted by the National Army, which destroyed their food stores. The civilian population's clearing of the fields is also thorough. The bandits cannot obtain food at the front, and they lack transportation at the rear, making supply difficult. Therefore, the bandit army is experiencing food shortages, resorting to eating leaves and fruits to fill their bellies, and many are surrendering.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 22nd] There have been no major changes in the war situation in the Northeast in the past week. The bandits' harassment of the Jin-Yu section of the Bei-Ning Railway did not achieve its goal of containing. The bandits in western Liaoning are gathering in the Rehe area, and the battle for Chengde has begun. The Communists clearly want to control the Jin-Gu Line and open a corridor along the Great Wall to connect the Northeast with Rehe and Chahar. A summary of the bandit army's movements: (1) The 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th Vertical Columns of the bandits in northern Liaoning have moved south of the Ping-Mei Line and may cross the central-Chang Line and flee west; (2) the 1st Vertical Column of the bandits in western Liaoning has arrived northeast of Chengde, and the 7th and 9th Vertical Columns are entrenched in the Jiuguan-Hemen Ershijiazi area; (3) the 4th Vertical Column of the bandits in southern Liaoning is attempting to cross the Liao River and flee west, approaching the railway line.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] The Jin-Yu section of the Bei-Ning Line continues to suffer multiple instances of damage. Over a dozen places between Tangfang, Tianzhuang, Feizhuang, and Lutai stations have been destroyed. There was fierce fighting near Feizhuang. Traffic was restored at 3 PM. It is also reported that nearly 10,000 Communist bandits have gathered again between Gubeikou and Shixia.

<h3>Capital Students Cause Trouble; Authorities Determined to Handle According to Law; Ministry of Education Sends Telegram to Presidents of Central University and Jinling University to Rectify Academic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1 AM on the 23rd] The number of Communist spies and professional students who were mobilized by Communist spies yesterday did not exceed 200 to 400 people. Their strength is far less than generally predicted. The military and police authorities in the capital have decided to handle them according to the law. It will not be difficult to restrain them and make them obey. However, these troublemakers have recklessly insulted an organization of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, which has aroused the indignation of the general party members in the capital. The Central Daily News published an editorial on the 23rd, calling on comrades with blood and enthusiasm to rise up together, save the country from ruin, and avenge the party's humiliation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Because some students of Central University and Jinling University openly opposed the government, denigrated the head of state, and shouted reactionary slogans, which exceeded the scope of academic freedom, the Ministry of Education telegraphed Qi Shounan, President of Central University, and Chen Yuguang, President of Jinling University, on the 22nd to strictly prohibit them. The original telegram stated briefly: According to reports, yesterday some students of the two universities jointly held an evening party, performing absurd programs opposing the government and denigrating the head of state. Today, they rushed into the auditorium of Central University, shouting reactionary slogans and insulting teachers. It is also heard that they will gather on the Jinling University lawn tonight to hold a so-called great unity evening party. This kind of illegal behavior exceeds the scope of academic freedom and is clearly a planned action. In order to take care of the studies of the majority of pure youth, the Ministry cannot tolerate these few illegal and out-of-bounds elements any longer. They should be stopped immediately, severely punished, and the leading students identified and expelled from school to rectify the academic atmosphere. This is extremely important.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The "Nanjing College and University Students Commemorative Meeting for the Anniversary of May 20th" organized by some students of Central University and Jinling University caused an incident and then used this as an excuse to launch a three-day strike. The majority of students who cherish their studies and stay clean and do not get involved have been very cold to this. The situation in the colleges of arts, sciences, law, medicine, and agriculture of Central University is even better, as if it were an ordinary day.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Speaks</h3>
<p>Hoping That Young People Will Not Test the Law</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, spoke in a serious manner about the illegal actions of a small number of students in the current Beijing City who are attempting to expand the student movement and disrupt social order. His remarks are as follows: "The country is vigorously implementing two major tasks: constitutionalism and suppression of rebellion. The responsibility is heavy. It is hoped that all the people will be united in mind and virtue to succeed. Recently, a small number of Communist professional students have mixed into the rear, launching a student movement, attempting to destroy social order in order to achieve their conspiracy to be a tiger as a tyrant. Their actions are extremely absurd and their intentions are extremely dangerous. The country cares for young people in every possible way. Closing its eyes to evil and hiding the evil of the past, punishing evil and rewarding good are the inherent responsibilities of the country. Moreover, during the emergency period of suppressing rebellion, punishment of crimes is especially urgent. We, bearing the heavy responsibility of guarding the capital, follow the government's intention and hereby re-promulgate the Emergency Crimes Ordinance Endangering the Country during the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. It is hoped that our young students will repent and not test the law. It is also hoped that they will encourage each other, and understand the difficulties of nation-building, and help each other to rise up, which is important."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Capital Garrison Headquarters, for the disturbance caused by some students of Central University and Jinling University, which endangers public order, has telegraphed the authorities of the two universities to advise and stop them. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>A Portion of Vocational Students Encircle the Youth Department</h3>
<p>[Another Telegram] On the evening of the 21st, a portion of vocational students in the capital city held a "May 20th Commemoration Evening" at the Central University (中大), where they wantonly insulted the head of state and slandered the government, arousing the audience's indignation, which led to a conflict. At 1:30 AM on the 22nd, a group of dispersing students encountered Sun Guizhen (孫桂筠), a student from Jinling University (金大) who had performed at the evening party, near the Drum Tower Youth Department (鼓樓靑年部). After recognizing her, they dragged her to the Youth Department. The Youth Department, considering that this matter was beyond its purview, requested the security authorities to take away the two students. At 2:30 AM, approximately one hundred students each from Central University and Jinling University, using the pretext of requesting the release of the arrested students, swarmed to the Youth Department and encircled it.

<h3>Industrialization and the People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>— Wang Zunming</p>
<p>In itself, an ideal is most valuable if it is perfect and comprehensive. However, it is somewhat regrettable if there is a lack of methods to achieve the ideal, as it becomes a pie in the sky, unable to alleviate the current hunger. If a way to realize the ideal can be devised, gradually approaching the ideal, it not only quenches the thirst like sour plums but also leads to a state of ultimate bliss. Democratic thought is like this. In the last one or two hundred years, it has become widely popular. Tracing the origins of democratic thought, refined concepts existed as early as the Zhou and Qin dynasties, as well as in some Greek city-states. However, its partial implementation occurred in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. During these one or two hundred years, the Industrial Revolution has been gradually completed. First, steam, then electricity, oil, and hydropower have increased the power available by dozens of times compared to the population, and have also freed people from the hardship of sweating profusely. How to utilize this enormous power? There are millions of precise spindles, as well as majestic water gates that span great rivers. From the mountains and the sea to the sky, from the cities to the deserts, all have been influenced by the Industrial Revolution. Barren lands of the past are now seas of wheat. Purple dye, fresh lychees, and velvet, which only emperors could enjoy in the past, are now enjoyed by countless people in industrialized countries. Furthermore, winter warmth, summer coolness, soaring into the sky, diving into the sea, the sounds and appearances of places ten thousand miles away are vividly before our eyes. These everyday lives of ordinary people are something that emperors of the past could not experience. As for the miraculous medicines invented in recent years, they have increased happiness and diluted disasters. Ancient emperors sought them in their dreams, believing they existed on immortal islands at sea, but unexpectedly, they are now right beside us.</p>
<p>Industrialization has revolutionized the mode of production, increasing wealth in clothing, food, housing, and transportation by percentages of ten to hundreds of times. With this strong foundation for distribution, it is easier to be fair, which is to move closer to the standard of democracy. The reformed mode of production reduces fatigue and lengthens leisure time, so that surplus energy can be used for enjoyment and learning beyond current production. Appropriate enjoyment accumulates work efficiency for reproduction. What is explored in learning is the understanding of the nature and relationships of things and people. For things, the further understanding that is elucidated rarely involves individuals, thus establishing objective right and wrong. Based on this publicly recognized knowledge, the further improvement of the mode of production is promoted, which will continue to increase wealth. For people, further understanding is related to oneself, and often self-interest obscures right and wrong, thus causing disputes, debates, and struggles. However, the truth always transcends self-interest, and clouds cannot hide the sun and moon for long. Industrialization has given countless people the opportunity for deep thought and exploration, and truth will emerge from error and obfuscation. After industrialization, learning is open to most people. In terms of wisdom, there is equality; in the direction of distribution, it must be fair, that is, the standard of distribution must be democratic. From the perspective of producing wealth, industrialization has prepared the material basis for democracy; from the perspective of distributing wealth, industrialization has established the demand for democracy.</p>
<p>Not only China, but before full industrialization, the living standards of England, America, Germany, and Russia were relatively low. In daily life, the enjoyment of the rich and the poor was obviously very different. At that time, British coal mines generally used women and children, each carrying dozens of pounds of coal, crawling and snaking through the mine tunnels. Even twenty years ago, workers in American steel mills still worked twelve-hour shifts. Every other week, the day and night shifts were interchanged. A worker had to work twenty-four hours every day for half a month, which greatly affected their health. During Imperial Russia, ordinary farmers were like the private property of the landlords; the internal passport system was used, and most farmers were not allowed to leave the land freely, legally defining the landlord's ruthless exploitation of the farmers. At that time, the common people of England, America, Germany, and Russia did not live in reinforced concrete houses, nor did they wear clean and tidy cotton or wool; only a few people enjoyed fish and meat and rode in carriages. This situation was naturally unfair and painful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to this day, the situation in our country remains stagnant in this state of poverty. Thirty years ago, the May Fourth Movement re-proposed the slogan of democracy and also raised the banner of science. This is different from talking about democracy alone for thousands of years. Pure science explores truth and establishes the philosophical basis for democracy; applied science develops production, which is also industrialization, promoting the realization of democracy. The method of realizing truth may change rapidly with the times; however, the existence of truth is constant throughout eternity. Before industrialization, the distribution of enjoyment should have been fair. After industrialization, the wealth to supply fair distribution is more abundant, and the call for fair distribution is stronger. Since the May Fourth Movement, the performance of applied science, that is, the achievement of industry, is still not much. In terms of railways, the extension is limited; in terms of rivers, floods are disastrous; mountains are barren; forests are sparse; the ocean is desolate with few fishing boats. Our country's steel production and crude oil production are only ten-thousandths of America's. Only a few cities use electric lights, and even distant brightness and darkness cannot be guaranteed. Even with the call for democracy, the material basis is poor, and most people have no choice but to cling to the edge of freezing poverty. A very small number of people crave enjoyment, and some even go to the point of committing outrageous crimes. Although they are so insane, how many of these people who commit crimes can attain the living standards of the common people in modern industrialized countries? Only by industrializing production and democratizing enjoyment can the lives of the general public be improved. Otherwise, it is ultimately impossible and uneasy to have the masses hungry while a few are full, or the masses cold while a few are warm. Without a doubt, the very serious foreign troubles of the past thirty years are the main reason for our country's weak level of industrialization; in addition, the lack of industrial talent and appropriate organization also plays a role. If all obstacles can be eliminated, full industrialization can, in the near future, have sufficient wealth to supply a fair distribution that meets democratic standards, that is, to achieve economic equality.</p>
<p>What will come with full industrialization is not only the increase of wealth. Work is divided into several categories. Each category is divided into several sections. Each person only does one section, which naturally becomes more refined and less laborious. The overall efficiency increases, and mutual dependence intensifies. Together, the output is ten times greater, but separated, there is no achievement. Ideas are also disseminated on a large scale. Newspapers are as dense as snowflakes. Radio is as turbulent as waves. Newspapers and radio transmit and centralize news, enhance interest, and standardize tastes. Individual abilities certainly increase; the connection between people becomes closer. Therefore, individual freedom must not exceed reasonable boundaries. It is like walking freely in the wilderness, but not going far; driving carefully on the street, traveling hundreds of miles in a moment. Industrialization has accelerated the opening of closed areas and eliminated small countries. The Eskimos in the snowy lands of the Arctic can no longer hibernate, and bombers are flying in the sky. The natives under the coconut trees on the small islands of the South Seas can no longer sit still, and Bikini Island is practicing with atomic bombs. Slightly larger countries, such as Switzerland and Sweden, can no longer be outside the world's political situation. The actions of one country often affect the entire world.</p>
<p>The result of industrialization: One is the sufficiency of clothing and food, and enjoyment tends to be fair; the other is the complexity of transportation, and organization tends to be strict. The former develops economic equality, and the latter regulates political freedom. All ideals must be reasonable to exist. Since the beginning of mankind, democratic economics and politics have been the most sublime ideals. Due to industrialization, democratic ideals have gained the possibility and scope of realization.</p>

<h3>During a Reception for the Beijing Reporters' Delegation, Yan Xishan Made a Speech</h3>
<p>Decides to Pursue Five Years of Self-Study After the Suppression of the Communists is Completed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan Dispatch] During the visit of the capital reporters' delegation to Bing (并), the host, Yan Xishan (閻錫山), engaged in two unrestricted and candid conversations with the reporters' delegation for about five hours each during the welcoming and farewell banquets, as well as before and after the banquets. Reporters were invited to accompany them, taking the opportunity to learn some interesting things.</p>
<p>During the evening meeting on the 16th, some colleagues asked if Mr. H.H. Kung (孔祥熙) had said that he had a lot of property in his ancestral home of Taigu (太谷), and whether his land had also been divided up in the same way as part of the implementation of the soldier-farmer integration. Bo Youcheng (薄右丞), who was in charge of the soldier-farmer integration, immediately replied that the parts he donated to schools and hospitals were handled according to the central government's regulations on public property for schools and hospitals, and all private property had been divided up. This was handled by the county cadres. The implementation of the soldier-farmer integration never considered the question of whose land should not be divided.</p>
<p>Another colleague pointed out that Shanxi has a considerable governance system, mainly the achievements of the soldier-farmer integration. If other counties across the country also want to implement it, can the Director participate in the next presidential election? Mr. Yan replied, "I have not considered the election issue. I plan to spend five years studying after the suppression of the Communists is completed. The government has entrusted me with 106 counties and cities to eliminate the Communist bandits and return them intact. Only then can I be worthy of the country and the people of Shanxi." The colleague said that the Director's plan to study for five years contradicts what the Director just said, that after taking public office, one should not read for oneself. Mr. Yan replied, "I am 66 years old this year. According to national regulations, I should have retired at 62. I feel that the harvest of life should have a pure and honorable result. I will spend these five years clearing up my own composition. This is the principle of nature, not studying while in office, but self-studying after retirement."</p>
<p>Another colleague mentioned that they learned in Fenyang (汾陽) that the people's dissatisfaction was not about the soldier-farmer integration itself, but about the unreasonable burden of the price difference in military grain purchases. Mr. Yan replied, "Although the people are dissatisfied with the military grain purchases when the soldier-farmer integration is implemented, they will definitely be able to get through it. If the soldier-farmer integration had not been implemented, it would not have been possible to seek such dissatisfaction. The Provincial Assembly told me that the unreasonable burden suffered by the people of Shanxi due to the price difference in military grain purchases amounted to 9 trillion yuan, which is almost one-seventh of the total amount of legal tender required by the country for the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the two years of suppressing the Communists. Speaking of the price difference in military grain purchases, the people already have an attitude of 'perish together with you.' This problem is most serious in Shanxi and Northeast China. It is said that the Northeast can already transport a large amount of grain by air, so Shanxi is the most difficult."</p>
<p>Another colleague pointed out that he heard that a famous doctor had examined the Director's body and said that the Director could live to 95 years old. Mr. Yan said: "According to the doctor's examination of my lungs, they are considered particularly strong. If only speaking of the lungs, I may be able to live to 150 years old, but I feel that because the lungs are good, they have damaged the large intestine. This is also a common effect, if one thing is bad, the whole body is bad. Since taking responsibility, I have been tidying up my posthumous writings every New Year's Day. This posthumous writing is divided into three parts: a posthumous presentation, a posthumous order, and a will."</p>
<p>The last colleague raised a rather interesting question. He said: "I heard that Mr. Yan's wife recently passed away. Is there a plan to marry a new wife?" As soon as these words came out, there was a burst of laughter. Mr. Yan kindly replied, "I have no intention of this." Our colleague continued, "Having a wife may be of great help." Mr. Yan replied, "I have not felt that there is a need for a woman's help. My household affairs are extremely simple, and I don't need anyone to take care of them." A long and informal conversation of five hours ended at about 11:00 PM, with everyone laughing all the way out of the General Headquarters. (Dispatch from Zhongshu on the 17th.)</p>

<h3>The Impact of Japanese Goods Sales in Hong Kong on Southern Migration Industry</h3>
<p>--Hong Kong 20th Sea Courier --Our Newspaper Hong Kong Correspondent Zi Jian</p>
<p>According to the official announcement from the Hong Kong government, Hong Kong's trade with Japan last year had a total deficit of 5.34 million US dollars. Since the Tokyo Allied Headquarters allowed Japanese goods to be settled in gold pounds, the sales of Japanese goods in Hong Kong have increased sharply. In the first quarter of this year, Hong Kong's trade deficit with Japan has reached a huge 4.3 million US dollars. In addition to being directly shipped from Japanese ports to Hong Kong, Japanese goods are also shipped from Singapore with a change of labeling to disguise them as American goods. More than half of the so-called "Made in America" goods are actually Japanese goods. The Hong Kong government has increased the number of trading companies approved to engage in trade with Japan from more than a dozen to more than forty. Trading companies that used to purchase American goods have now changed course and are purchasing Japanese goods.</p>
<p>The result of the massive dumping of Japanese goods is that the light industry that flourished in Hong Kong and China after the war, especially the cotton weaving industry, is the first to suffer. In the past few months, 71 cotton weaving factories have been forced to close down, accounting for about one-tenth of the total. Other industries such as enamelware, electrical appliances, toys, and light metal manufacturing are also under severe threat from "cheap" Japanese goods. The Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, seeing this, first sent a telegram to the British government protesting the policy of allowing Japanese goods to be sold in Hong Kong. Other economic figures in Hong Kong and China have also responded unanimously and have issued a "Declaration Against the Dumping of Japanese Goods."</p>
<p>The development of Hong Kong's industry is endangered by the dumping of Japanese goods. However, the Hong Kong government, which is responsible for promoting Hong Kong's prosperity, not only does not try to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods, but also sends commissioners to travel back and forth between Tokyo and Hong Kong to preside over trade with Japan. According to Hong Kong and Chinese economic observers, there are two important reasons for this: (1) The small industries established in Hong Kong after the war aim for huge profits, and the wages of workers are also beyond normal levels, resulting in surprisingly high prices, which are comparable to those of European and American goods. Now that they are facing competition from Japanese goods, they have to reduce profits and reduce costs to counter them. In this way, the public can buy relatively cheap daily necessities. (2) By replacing American goods with Japanese goods, merchants can purchase Japanese goods settled in pounds instead of American goods, which can reduce the Hong Kong government's consumption of US dollars, which is of great benefit to Hong Kong's finances. At the same time, the Hong Kong government reserves a place for London's exporters. In the future, when British products can be supplied to the Far East market in large quantities, British goods will replace Japanese goods and be dumped to mainland China in large quantities, using Hong Kong as a base (Japanese goods imported into Hong Kong are subject to the Hong Kong government's control).</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government publishes a monthly bulletin of factories that are registered and applying for registration. In April, 36 new factories were added in Hong Kong, bringing the total number of registered factories to 988. Among them, 253 are in Hong Kong and 735 are in Kowloon. In April, 39 new factories applied for registration with the Labour Department, including 7 metal manufacturing plants and weaving mills each, 2 enamel factories, yarn factories, and printing factories each. This is in stark contrast to the phenomenon of factories closing down due to the dumping of Japanese goods. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The answer to this question lies in the old story of domestic industry and mobile funds pouring into Hong Kong. The new factories that are springing up like mushrooms are the result of domestic funds in Hong Kong this year. When they were preparing to set up, they did not expect that Japanese goods would come so quickly and overwhelmingly. Now that Japanese goods have arrived, they have become arrows at the end of their flight. They cannot stop, so they have to bite the bullet and continue to do it. If possible, they should also roll up their sleeves and compete with Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Domestic funds should never have been invested in Hong Kong for the sake of temporary cheapness. Those "profit-only" merchants have now begun to "reap what they sow." In addition to feeling the pressure of Japanese goods, the newly established factories in Hong Kong are being dragged down by the high wages in Hong Kong and China and are now secretly complaining. Nanyang Yarn Factory recently caused a sensational labour dispute in Hong Kong due to the issue of workers' treatment. People in all circles find it a bit "unbelievable" that this "well-funded and large-scale" new yarn factory that moved south from Shanghai actually announced a strike less than a month after its official opening. This was also unexpected by those domestic capitalists who went south proudly.</p>
<p>A few days ago, according to information from reliable sources, several wealthy merchants from Shanghai could not find houses in Hong Kong and could not settle down. In a fit of anger, they angrily turned to Guangzhou. Is it really impossible for these wealthy merchants to find a place to settle down in Hong Kong? Not to mention the luxurious hotels or modern apartments in Hong Kong and China, even the mansions of their wealthy friends are enough for them to enjoy. However, they left without showing up. They are blessed. Let this "paradise" be "first come, first served" by those scoundrels.</p>
<p>Another "sin" of the southward movement of domestic funds to Hong Kong is that it turns the working capital for national construction into a dead piece of land wrapped in a foreign colony. In the past year, the price of land, whether in the most prosperous downtown area or the most secluded suburbs (which can be used as factory sites), has increased tenfold. This is entirely the result of the southward mobile funds competing to purchase it. In the six months after the Japanese army withdrew from Hong Kong, Hong Kong's real estate unanimously declined, and the Hong Kong government's "development plan" died. Now, with the southward mobile funds rushing to buy land, Hong Kong and China's mountain-moving and sea-filling projects have emerged. Remote bays, such as North Point in Hong Kong, Tokwawan, Ngau Chi Wan, and Cheung Sha Wan in Kowloon, have all been started to be filled into flat land for residential or factory areas. The newspaper often sees the grand plan of building a new Hong Kong. The iron hammer of the pile driver strikes the heart of the land time and time again, making some people on the Atlantic coast unable to help but revisit their beautiful old dreams for this small island that was originally intended to be "abandoned."</p>

<h3>Current Situation in Palestine Develops Sharpening Anglo-American Relations British Envoy to the US Meets Lovett US Demands Sanctions Be Imposed Under the UN Charter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco 22nd Radio: Well-informed sources claim: US Secretary of State Lovett will discuss with the British whether sanctions can be imposed in the Middle East in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 21st Dispatch] British Ambassador to Washington Balfour met with US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett for an hour today, making it increasingly believed that the Palestinian issue has worsened Anglo-American relations. It is rumored in Washington that President Truman will soon announce the lifting of the arms embargo on Israel, possibly after the Security Council rejects the US resolution declaring that the situation in Palestine has threatened peace. If this is the case, it will form a situation in which the United States supplies arms to Israel, while Britain provides military aid to Transjordan. At the same time, American newspapers' criticism of Britain's "participation" in the Arab war has also been increasing.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] People here are deeply concerned that the situation in Palestine will hinder relations between Britain and the United States. Britain will do its best within its capabilities to avoid a state of opposition between Britain and the United States in the Palestinian war.</p>
<p>[United Press New York 21st Dispatch] The Palestinian issue has begun to strain relations between Britain and the United States. Although it has not reached the point where the two countries have filed formal protests, if Britain continues to aid Arab countries in attacking the Jews in the Holy Land, the above-mentioned may occur. Privately, the United States and Britain have accused each other. The United States believes that Britain is observing the war in the Holy Land with a long-term view of its oil interests in the Middle East, disregarding Arab aggression and killing Jews. Britain believes that the United States is short-sighted because there are many Jews in the United States who can influence political issues. To this day, the rift between the United States and Britain has become more acute. The United States has recognized the State of Israel, but Britain has not recognized it. British spokesmen have said that they will not recognize the State of Israel for some time. If there is a showdown between Britain and the United States, President Truman seems to have the upper hand because the United States is paying money for the European Recovery Program, which is the greatest hope for Britain's economic recovery.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 21st Dispatch] According to reliable sources, Deputy Secretary of State Lovett met with British First Counselor Sir Balfour for 40 minutes today. It is said that they discussed the situation in Palestine. Sir Balfour tried to reconcile the opinions of Britain and the United States in the Security Council, but the State Department failed to make any decision. The same source also pointed out that British public opinion does not support the British government's attitude, and the US government's efforts to avoid aiding the State of Israel will put the United Nations in a stalemate.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow 21st Dispatch] The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, criticized on the 21st that Britain deliberately hinders the solution of the Palestinian issue in order to strengthen its position among Arab countries. The newspaper also said that Britain should be responsible for the Palestinian issue and should now support the United Nations resolutions and assume this responsibility, and should not obstruct the solution of the problem.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch] Officials of the British Embassy denied that US news agencies reported that Britain had requested to hold a meeting with the United States to resolve the dispute between Britain and the United States over Palestine. This report was apparently a misrepresentation after British Ambassador to the US Balfour visited US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett yesterday to discuss the Palestinian issue. At the same time, American newspapers did not hesitate to speculate in great length about the possibility that Anglo-American relations would deteriorate due to Palestine. Related parties believe that Balfour's visit to Lovett was intended to avoid the major differences that would arise between Britain and the United States in the event that the United States lifted the arms embargo on the State of Israel while Britain continued to support the Transjordan army. Although these informal contacts are continuing, there is no suggestion that a formal meeting will be convened to facilitate this effort.</p>
<h3>Did Britain Use US Aid to Support Arab Armies? US Senate to Investigate Bevin Tells US Ambassador Anglo-Arab Relations Must Be Maintained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London 22nd Radio: British Foreign Secretary Bevin spoke with US Ambassador Douglas today to discuss the differences between Britain and the United States on the Palestinian issue. According to diplomatic sources, the British side has informed the United States that Anglo-Arab relations must be maintained in order to prevent the southward flow of communism.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 22nd Dispatch] Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges said on the 22nd that if Congress finds that part of the European Recovery Fund is used to arm Arab armies, Congress may reduce the total amount that Britain should receive. He said that the Appropriations Committee will investigate the scope of British funding to Arab armies fighting the Jews.</p>
<p>If it is found that Britain has used US aid to fund Arab military operations, then Congress's reduction of Britain's share of $1.324 billion would be "very appropriate." The European Recovery Fund has been passed by Congress, but it must be approved by the Senate and House Appropriations Committees before it can be used. Senator Brewster told the Senate that Britain promised to provide King Abdullah of Transjordan with $8 million because of US economic assistance. Therefore, Bridges agreed to investigate, and many people in Congress also demanded the cancellation of the order to embargo arms to the Middle East.</p>
<p>[United Press London 22nd Dispatch] US Ambassador to Britain Douglas was summoned to visit the British Foreign Office on the 22nd and discussed the Palestinian issue with Foreign Secretary Bevin. Sources familiar with the matter said that the meeting took place because Washington announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee would investigate whether Britain would use the European Recovery Fund to fund Arab countries participating in the Palestinian war.</p>
<h3>Mayor of Jerusalem Takes Office</h3>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia 21st Dispatch] Reverend Evans, the temporary mayor of Jerusalem appointed by the United Nations, will leave for his post on the 22nd to restore order in Jerusalem. Vera, one of the directors of the Friends Service Committee, will also accompany him.</p>
<h3>President of Israel to Meet Truman on Tuesday</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington 21st Dispatch] The White House announced today that Dr. Weizmann, the temporary president of the new Jewish State of Israel, will meet with President Truman on Tuesday. The White House said that Weizmann is expected to arrive in Washington from New York on Monday and discuss the situation in Palestine with Truman the next day.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Indian Muslim Groups Support Arab Clans</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The Chinese Islamic Association today telegraphed the Arab League in Cairo, promising to send 50 Chinese Muslims to support the Palestinian war. At the same time, the Arab League also telegraphed Jiang Tingfu, the head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations, praising his impartial attitude towards the Palestinian issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters Karachi 21st Dispatch] Tens of thousands of Muslims from all over Karachi gathered in front of the US Embassy today to demonstrate, shouting slogans against the "US-Soviet-Jewish Axis." They also demanded the removal of the American flag. Fortunately, US Ambassador Erlin was calm and personally stepped onto the balcony to address the demonstrators in detail. Today was designated as "Palestine Day" by Muslims to show support for the Arab tribe to protest the US-Soviet support for Israel. All Muslim shops in the city were closed for one day.</p>
<h3>UN Mediator to Fly to the Holy Land on Thursday</h3>
<p>[Reuters Stockholm 21st Dispatch] Count Bernadotte, President of the Swedish Red Cross, has expressed his willingness to serve as the UN Palestine Mediator. He told Reuters: "My acceptance of this task is because I believe that there is still a glimmer of hope for success. I know that the Palestinian issue is by no means an internal matter between the Jews and Arabs, but a spark that can lead to a major war. If there is a glimmer of hope for success, it is worth trying." He also said: Before accepting this position, he telegraphed UN Secretary-General Lie, asking about the status of the mediator, and stated that his attempt to take this position should not exceed six months. Lie replied to him on the afternoon of the 21st, informing him that he has considerable freedom to make suggestions and take actions. Bernadotte added that he will fly to Palestine next Thursday, and will retain the status of an official of the International Red Cross while in that area.</p>
<h3>Lebanon Detains American Jews US Protests Protest Letter Delivered to Arab Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 21st Dispatch] The State Department announced that the US government has ordered its representatives in various Arab countries to warn those governments not to discriminate against American citizens of Jewish descent. The US Ambassador to Lebanon protested to the Lebanese government yesterday over the fact that 40 American citizens were transferred from a US ship in Beirut to a detention center in Lebanon on Wednesday. He also stated that if these Americans are not restored to freedom, or any other Americans are arrested by the Lebanese authorities simply because they are of Jewish descent, the United States will bear the responsibility for protection. Copies of the protest letter have been delivered to the representatives of the United States in various Arab countries.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Expansion to 70 Group Case President Signs Into Law But States Reservation of Power to Use Additional Funds</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 21st Dispatch] President Truman today signed the $3.198 billion new aircraft purchase bill, but added a statement stating that he may not allow the use of the additional $822 million added by Congress to begin building a 70-group air force. Truman issued a statement stating that his signing of the bill does not mean that he is abandoning his current position that a 66-group air force is sufficient. Truman also said, "Congress has determined that in addition to the amount that I consider necessary, an additional $822 million should be added, but it is also stipulated that this amount cannot be used unless the President believes that "entering into a contract is necessary for national defense." The security of the United States requires an entire defense plan built on the foundation of a sound economic system and must be determined by the standard of expenses that can be afforded in the years to come. This is the reason why I am willing to implement the provisions of this bill." After the bill is signed by the President, the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force will immediately order the first batch of new aircraft among the 4,200 new aircraft stipulated in the bill, most of which are jet aircraft.</p>
<h3>Israel Informs the Security Council that the Jewish Side Is Willing to Ceasefire Immediately; US Urges Intervention in Holy Land War, Resolution Yet to Be Voted On</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 22nd Broadcast: Israel today notified the Security Council, stating that the Jewish side agrees to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Another report: According to Jewish forces, the Arab forces' attack on the Old City of Jerusalem today was repelled.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd Dispatch] American sources claim that the United States may, on the 22nd, overcome British opposition and urge the United Nations to forcefully intervene in the Palestine war. They expect the United Nations Security Council to pass the American proposal, ordering a halt to the bloodshed in the Holy Land, by a necessary majority of seven votes.</p>
<p>If so, Britain will also not use its veto power to obstruct the majority decision. The Security Council convened a special meeting on Saturday, hoping to pass a resolution to halt or at least alleviate the war between the Jews and Arabs. However, the decision on whether to pass the American proposal remains unresolved. Previously, the United States had almost given up hope of passing its proposal, but Canada, Colombia, and Belgium suddenly expressed their agreement to take consistent action with the United States. With Soviet support, Nicaragua is urging the Security Council to take a firm stance, not hesitating to use economic sanctions or even force to stop the war. Britain, with the support of China and possibly two other countries, hopes to avoid overly decisive action and instead pass a ceasefire request, not intending to punish any side that resists.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch] Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko today requested the United Nations Security Council to pass the American proposal and take strong action to stop the war in Palestine, without further delay. However, the Security Council then discussed the issue of the Czech Communist coup at the afternoon meeting, and it is still unknown when the Holy Land case will be put to a vote. Gromyko criticized the British proposed peace mediation plan as insufficient, stating that Britain is now openly assisting Transjordan, whose King Abdullah, with British support, has become a modern Caesar in the Middle East. At the same time, Syrian representative Faris al-Khouri declared that the American original proposal advocates ordering the Arabs to cease fire without protecting Palestine or implementing partition, a point that the Arab side finds difficult to accept. The Arabs will continue to oppose partition and the so-called Jewish and Arab states.</p>
<h3>New Gold Mine Discovered in Northern Australian Desert</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd Dispatch] The "Daily Mail" here today reported that since the secret gold mine exploitation in northern Australia in the early part of this century, the richest gold mine has recently been discovered in that area. The newspaper stated that the gold mine's vein was discovered in the desert by a person named Harris and his wife Claire. They have transferred the mining rights to a company formed by Melbourne financiers and named Claire Mrs. Pty. Ltd. for a price of £25,000 and 25,000 shares in the company.</p>
<h3>West German Political Structure Issues; Three Countries Reach Preliminary Agreement; Financial Reform Expected This Summer</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] The conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and the six Benelux countries to discuss the German issue held a plenary meeting on the 21st, without publishing a communique afterward. However, observers believe that the convening of this last plenary meeting indicates that some basic agreements have been reached on the two issues of international control of the Ruhr and the organization of the West German constitutional assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st Dispatch] Foreign affairs officials said today that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have reached a preliminary agreement on the issue of establishing a West German provisional government, and that it will be formally announced early next week once the details are agreed upon. The six countries decided to convene the West German constitutional assembly around September 1 to draft the West German constitution. The three occupying powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France retain veto power over export trade, currency, and diplomatic policies.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st Dispatch] An official spokesperson claimed that the British and American authorities in Germany will soon implement financial reform directly, without going through the four-power agreement. A spokesperson for the German affairs department said that this reform will be implemented in the summer or autumn, at which time the existing banknotes will be withdrawn and replaced with new banknotes. In addition to this reform, a capital surcharge will also be implemented intermittently. The spokesperson also stated that this reform will strengthen the currency system of the joint occupation zones.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st Dispatch] The governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have completely agreed to simultaneously implement financial reform in the three occupation zones of West Germany, and the date of its implementation has not been revealed. According to responsible opinions, it will not be implemented before this summer, and the issue of expanding the reform to the Berlin area occupied by the three Western European countries has not been resolved. The negotiations on German financial reform began months ago, with the Soviet Union initially participating but later withdrawing.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 21st Dispatch] The International Red Cross has sent telegrams to the governments of six countries: Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the government of the State of Israel, requesting them to respect the safety zones within the city of Jerusalem in order to protect the safety of non-combatants.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch] The Arab side claims that the Arab Legion has almost taken control of the entire Jerusalem. The Israeli public announcement from Tel Aviv admits that the Jewish forces inside and outside Jerusalem are in a serious situation. The Arab Legion's artillery fire is particularly fierce, and all strategic points in the Jerusalem area still occupied by Jewish forces are the targets of their bombing. At the same time, the Egyptian army is advancing rapidly and has reached a point four miles south of Jerusalem, where it will be able to join forces with the Arab Legion. The 100,000 Jews in the Jerusalem area have run out of food and water, and their morale is plummeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] The war in Palestine has entered its sixth day. Based on reports from both the Jewish and Arab sides and neutral sources, the latest war situation is as follows: Southern Front Egyptian Army: The Egyptian army's attack on the Yatir Motke Jewish area, ten miles north of Gaza, was repelled by the Jewish forces. Egyptian artillery also bombed Deir al-Balah, near the Egyptian army's front-line command post north of Gaza. Eastern Route: The Egyptian army, after occupying Beersheba, has not been reported to have made significant progress. Transjordan's public announcement repeated: The Potash factory north of the Dead Sea and the nearby Jewish areas did not heed the Transjordan Legion's warnings to surrender and instead set themselves on fire. Therefore, the Transjordan army has occupied these areas. Northeastern Front along the Jordan River: Aircraft from Transjordan, Iraq, and Syria have been deployed to cover the operation and attack the Jewish front lines. The Israeli Air Force, after its first deployment in the Galilee theater on the 20th, was not active on the 21st.</p>

<h3>Before South Korea Has Security Forces, US Troops Do Not Intend to Withdraw; South Korea's New National Assembly to Convene This Month</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd Dispatch] South Korea has now begun organizing an international security force and has begun expanding recruitment in various places. Koreans between the ages of 18 and 25 are eligible to respond to the recruitment. This international security force is prepared to assume the defense work of the country when US troops withdraw from South Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st Dispatch] US government officials said on the 21st that if the new Korean government requests the United States after the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, a "large number" of US military, economic, and political advisors still intend to remain in South Korea. They stated that some of these advisors are US government officials, and some are American civilians hired by the Korean government.</p>
<p>At the same time, US officials emphasized that although the United States has decided to withdraw army dependents from South Korea, there is no definite plan for the withdrawal of US occupation forces. The withdrawal plan depends on several factors: First, how long will it take for the Koreans to enable the new government to function and establish appropriate security forces? Second, what recommendations will the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea make? Third, the general trend of the international situation. Officials here hope that the Korean government will be able to function before August 1. At the same time, State Department officials estimate that the number of US diplomatic personnel stationed in Seoul after the establishment of the new government will be between thirty and fifty people, but they also stated that there are other Americans stationed in Seoul. It is expected that the Korean government will request the US military advisory group to assist in the development of security forces.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd Dispatch] US military governor of South Korea, Major General Hodge, said when answering reporters' questions during an interview yesterday that the issue of when the new South Korean National Assembly will convene is currently under discussion and will be approximately before the 23rd of this month.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st Dispatch] US military commander in South Korea, Hodge, today published a letter to the Soviet military commander in North Korea, Korotkov, stating that there are sixty cars of goods, currently valued at more than two million US dollars, prepared to be delivered to North Korea to pay for electricity, but the immediate restoration of the current is a prerequisite for the delivery of goods and payment, or for negotiating future payment methods. Although this power outage was implemented by the North Korean People's Committee, Hodge believes that Korotkov should be responsible, and this move is obviously a political action to punish South Korea for the May 10 election. The goods to be delivered by South Korea include electrical equipment that the US occupation zone lacks. If North Korea does not want them, the people of South Korea are very willing to have them.</p>
<h3>US Closely Monitors Indian Communist Party's Activities</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] Well-informed sources have recently stated that US officials are convinced that the Indian Communist Party has abandoned the hope of "burrowing from within" and seizing power in the government and has instead tried to do its best to arrange the foundation for a "people's revolution." It is reported that the US government has always paid close attention to the activities of the Indian Communist Party and is increasingly interested in communist activities within the Hyderabad princely state. To date, the Hyderabad state has refused to join the Indian Dominion. Washington has received reports from diplomatic sources that the activities of the Indian Communist Party are extremely active and that government announcements and press reports are not enough to fully detail them.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Indian industrial community is disturbed by the Indian Communist Party, and the Communist Party is also inciting farmers.</p>

<h3>Strong Opposition in the UK to the US Policy of Supporting Japan; Particularly Concerned About Raising Japan's Industrial Level</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, since the report submitted by US Assistant Secretary of State Clayton, opposition has been quite high. In the Far Eastern Commission, the British representative also expressed opposition to this proposal from the US side. The British representative's opinion is that although the reparations issue is not solely aimed at limiting Japan's industrial level, the attitude of maintaining Japan's industrial level to exceed self-sufficiency cannot be tolerated. The British representative stated that in the Far Eastern Commission, the Japanese industrial level should be decided according to the opinions of the majority of countries, and the Japanese reparations issue should be decided by the Japanese industrial level.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] The World Trade Association predicts that Japan will be the third-ranked country in the world in terms of cotton and iron exports. However, given the recent international opposition to the US policy of supporting Japan, it is questionable whether Japan's foreign trade will proceed according to the US plan in the future.</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Bribery Case; Bribing Merchants Convicted; Ye Zonglin Sentenced to Three Years; Mao Runxiang Declared Not Guilty and Granted Bail; Shao Jiazhen and Five Others to Be Dealt With Separately After Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Bribing merchants in the sensational Shanghai Jianghai Customs major bribery case were sentenced on the 22nd by the Capital District Court. At around 5:00 PM, Court President Ouyang Shu of the District Court Criminal Division 1, Judge Ren Zhiwu, Zhao Ruji, Prosecutor Tian Jihou, and Clerk Wang Shuo appeared in court, bringing the defendants Ye Zonglin and Mao Runxiang to court. The judgment was read out, stating: "Ye Zonglin is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for paying bribes to public officials for acts that violate their duties, and is also fined three million yuan. He is to be deprived of public rights for three years. If he is unable to pay the fine, he is allowed to commute each day of the fine for one day of labor. Mao Runxiang is not guilty." The judgment first described the fact that when Ye Zonglin was the manager of Shanghai Tianhe and Dakang dye companies, before the two companies were established in the summer of 1946, he borrowed the name of Jiafu company, which was not registered with the transportation management committee, to pay a bribe of 100 million yuan to customs officials in order to prematurely and fraudulently import pigments purchased in the United States. After confirmation of the statements of various related personnel, "It is beyond doubt that the defendant paid bribes to public officials for acts that violate their duties. His actions are particularly heinous, and he is sentenced to three years of imprisonment, fined three million yuan, and deprived of public rights for three years." "As for the part of Mao Runxiang's accusation of bribery, there is no proof," "Since the defendant did not assist in fraud, he should be declared not guilty. Shao Jiazhen, Qiu Ziming, Shao Shuping, Shi Yiping, and Feng Yongnian will be dealt with separately after their arrest." Finally, the presiding judge ruled that Mao Runxiang was allowed bail after submitting a written security deposit of 200 million yuan and having a reliable store in Beijing provide a guarantee. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Foreign Electrical Staff's Dissatisfaction with Index Discount, City Government States Three Points</h3>
<p>The 100 Western staff members (totaling 17 nationalities) of the American-owned Shanghai Power Company, who were hired locally, recently expressed their dissatisfaction with the calculation method for their compensation as approved by the Municipal Government's Cost of Living Index Application Committee (which discounts salaries above 250 yuan). In the name of their association, they appealed in various Western newspapers in the city, stating the impropriety of the city government's restrictions on their salaries. It is said that they will petition the consuls of 13 countries to negotiate with the municipal authorities, demanding that the cost of living index for Western expatriates be calculated in full. A reporter from Dagon Society specifically visited a relevant official of the municipal government yesterday to inquire about their opinion. According to the official: (1) They are locally hired staff, not specialized personnel hired from abroad to work in China. Therefore, the company's treatment of them is the same as that of Chinese employees, and there is nothing special about it. (2) Luxurious parts of the cost of living should be discounted. (3) The treatment of employees of Chinese-owned public utility companies is actually very different compared to theirs.</p>

He recently got engaged to a Miss Wang from Suzhou. Because it was a free love marriage, the two were deeply in love. On the day of the engagement, Guo bought a gold bracelet for her to wear.

Recently, Miss Wang came to Shanghai from Suzhou, and Guo accompanied her on outings, which further displeased his mother. So she used the excuse that a female relative of hers needed to borrow the gold bracelet temporarily to wear to a wedding banquet, promising to return it in three days. However, after Zhang obtained the gold bracelet, she refused to return it. Her son, Guo Shunkang, argued with his mother on behalf of his wife, and a dispute arose between the mother and son.

<h3>Two Young American Men and Women Arrive in Shanghai After Travelling from the Communist Area, Having Served at the International Peace Hospital for Over a Year, Lack of Medicine, Even Mud Becomes a Substitute</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City, 22nd] Two young American men and women, who stayed in the communist area for fourteen months, have now arrived in Shanghai after trekking over two thousand miles from northern Shaanxi. The woman's name is Gwendolen, a nurse, and the man's name is Miles, a medical worker. They arrived in Yan'an together in March of last year. Two weeks later, they followed the communist army in its retreat and served in the "International Peace Hospital" established with foreign donations. The two traveled by foot and mule cart for about ten weeks before reaching the Nationalist area south of Tianjin, and then transferred to Shanghai. It is said that the CCP's opposition to American aid to China is still strong, and Wallace's speech is prominently featured in the newspapers. However, individual Americans are treated quite favorably, and their movements are not restricted. Medical personnel still in the communist area include the British couple Mr. and Mrs. Hsi, and the New Zealander Cliffored, all of whom are safe and sound. The hospital where the two served was one of the two hospitals withdrawn from Yan'an, located in Xiabaita. For convenience and safety, the entire hospital was divided into four groups. The patients were mostly wounded soldiers. However, there was a lack of penicillin, sulfa drugs, and plaster. The hospital's equipment was very simple. The operating room was a whitewashed cave, the windows were made of transparent sorghum stalks, and the operating table was made of two wooden boxes. Most of the operations were performed during the day to save oil. At night, only vegetable oil or kerosene lamps were used for lighting. Surgical supplies were also often replaced with other materials, such as using sesame oil instead of petroleum jelly, dried soil instead of talcum powder, and making DDT mixtures easily. The food for the local farmers was still sufficient. The most rampant diseases were typhus, relapsing fever, and tuberculosis. Soldiers mostly suffered head, arm, and leg injuries, and many operations had to be performed every week. Ms. Stanley plans to return to the United States in June, and Miles will stay in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Theatres Seek Protection, Authorities Striving to Prevent, War Veterans Moved to Suburbs, Seeking Early Departure, Suggesting Central Government Temporarily Refrain from Sending More</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, several theatres in the city have been harassed by armed men, such as destroying premises and beating employees, which has been happening frequently. All the theatres in the city jointly appealed to the authorities the other day, requesting that they be given real protection. A reporter visited the person in charge of security yesterday and asked if there were any effective measures to stop this trend. According to him: the recent incidents of soldiers harassing theatres were mostly caused by war veterans in transit. They had been on the battlefield for a long time and were disabled while fighting for the country. Now they are being sent back to their hometowns, and when they pass through the city, they see the extravagance of the city and are refused entry to the theatre. As a result, they are frustrated and take extreme action. While this is inappropriate in terms of military discipline, it is understandable in terms of reason and emotion. Now, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, in addition to contacting the transit troops in advance to arrange for designated entertainment venues for the transit soldiers to watch plays, the 800 war veterans who recently came to Shanghai have been moved to the suburbs near Longhua and their officers have been instructed to strictly restrain them and seek early departure. The division headquarters has also sent an urgent telegram to the central government requesting that they temporarily refrain from sending more war veterans before this batch of war veterans leaves Shanghai. At the same time, they actively suggested to the authorities that all future shipments of soldiers should not use Shanghai as a transfer point in order to avoid stimulating the soldiers' psychology and causing disputes. It is heard that the central government is considering this and may adopt it. As for the entertainment of local troops and wounded soldiers, it has been agreed that each theatre will take turns hosting them, and soldiers can watch a play once a week. Logically, there should be no additional radical actions. Otherwise, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Stamp Exhibition, Visitors Shoulder to Shoulder</h3>

Every day when the doors are closed, there are still a large number of visitors lingering and reluctant to leave. They must wait for the venue staff to repeatedly urge and persuade them before they leave. If the crowding situation does not subside by the closing date of the 25th, the Post Office and the Xinguang Stamp Association will consider extending the exhibition period.</p>
<h3>Assaulted, Detained, Found to Have Committed Theft</h3>

On the 9th of this month, Liu had a fight with his neighbor Chen Zhaolin at 6 Chuan Road. After being arrested by the Yulin Road Police Branch, he was imprisoned for seven days to deter his enemies for assaulting others. Subsequently, Zhu Jingen, a resident of 1182 Tonglu Road, heard the news and went to the station to accuse Liu of being a thief, saying that Liu came to his shop on February 22nd to buy a silver bracelet, valued at 240,000 yuan. As a result, Liu only paid 200,000 yuan, and the remaining 40,000 yuan was never returned. A few days later, when Liu passed by my door, my wife asked him to pay the 40,000 yuan. Not only did he not pay, but he also claimed, "I'll show you what's what in three days." On the afternoon of the 24th, at about 2 pm, six gangsters came and robbed them of 300 taels of silver, four gold rings, and 10 million yuan in cash. When they were robbing, Liu asked my wife for the key for a long time, so I clearly remembered his appearance. In addition, Liu's wife, Jing Hongbin, a resident of 1062 Xuchang Road, also went to the station to accuse Liu of robbing their home on April 19th, and stealing 11 small gold belts, four gold rings, and one gold bracelet. It has now been confirmed by investigation that he will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court on charges of robbery.</p>
<h3>"Sending Son Guanyin" Grand Gathering, Congratulating the Midwives Association's Third Congress</h3>
<p>— Lichun</p>
<p>In this city, there are more than 1,500 midwives who are regarded as Sending Son Guanyin. Under the leadership of the chairman, Ms. Xie Neng, they already had a strong organization two years ago—the Shanghai Midwives Association—and the association's work has made significant achievements. The qualifications of each member have been strictly reviewed. Not only must they have a diploma from a midwifery school, but they must also have a midwife certificate from the Ministry of Health. Most of these thousand-odd members, the younger ones, work in public and private medical institutions, and the older ones mostly practice on their own, distributed in every corner of the city, busy day and night for the safety of women and infants. The birth of hundreds of babies in this city every day can grow up entirely thanks to their hard work. They are not only the saviors of pregnant women, but also the nannies of the nation.</p>
<p>They all have a passion for service and professional confidence. Regardless of the severe cold or scorching heat, day and night, they must immediately go to perform the task of ensuring the safety of mothers and children upon the call of pregnant women—delivery. Sometimes they lose sleep at night to deliver babies, but during the day they must be responsible for prenatal and postnatal examinations of pregnant women, infant vaccinations, and other work. There are few opportunities to take a moment to rest. Therefore, their health is often affected by their irregular lives. As for entertainment, there is no opportunity. Midwifery is nominally a freelance profession, but it is actually a very unfree profession. They sacrifice their own freedom for the sake of women and infants, and in exchange for the safety of women and infants.</p>
<p>Their great spirit is truly admirable. Although the government does not treat them with courtesy, the low treatment of public medical institutions is not enough to maintain personal life, but they only bury their heads in hard work and never make any requests to their superiors, because they only want to dedicate what they have learned to society, and Hua Sheng exhausts their energy for women and infants, and they have a lofty position in society.</p>
<p>Today is the day of the third member conference of the Midwives Association. I would like to express my high expectations, hoping that the government will provide special assistance to the Midwives Association so that it can establish a stronger foundation, and I hope that Chairman Xie will lead all members with the same perseverance as in the past to save the suffering women and infants in our city and ascend to the other shore together.</p>

<h3>The Public Opinion Survey Committee Raises Prices, Rice Breaks Through Six Million Yesterday, Flour and Oil Rise in Unison</h3>
<p>Because the price of rice was lower than the price at the production site, the price in Wuxi rose sharply the day before. In addition, the Public Opinion Survey Committee also raised the price of rice. The price of rice sold by the Nanshi district was divided into four types, with the highest being 5.95 million and the lowest being 5.8 million, for a total of 2,138 shi sold. The prices in the Beishi district were divided into two types, 5.7 million and 5.9 million, with an average increase of 400,000. The former was sub-white, and the latter was late rice, for a total of 605 shi sold, which caused people's hearts to become more anxious. The cargo owners tried their best to raise prices, and special japonica reached 6.3 million yuan, while early rice and other varieties all reached over 6 million, a sharp increase of 300,000 to 350,000. The total amount of goods arriving in the North and South markets was 72.29 million.</p>
<p>The rise in flour prices is becoming increasingly fierce. Yesterday, riding on the rise in rice prices, people's hearts were even more firm. In addition, the price of flour sold by the China Trust Bureau increased by 150,000 yuan, reaching 1.95 million yuan delivered, and limited each household to 50 bags. Under the support of the cargo owners, the rise was like a wild horse galloping. Military ship and old car brands initially opened at 1.05 million, and then, under the competitive purchase of entering households, secretly rose to 2.16 million yuan outside the market. Red Bee and Jiancheng closed at 2.12 million each, an increase of 150,000 to 160,000 each. The price of bran rose by 120,000. Wheat cargo owners were holding on to prices, and no agreement was reached, so there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The rise in the price of miscellaneous grains has reappeared. Stimulated by the rise in rice prices, cargo owners tried their best to raise prices, and people's hearts were firm and anxious. Entering households competed to buy, and the market was very brisk. Soybeans rose by 200,000. Wuhan broad beans finally reached 3.4 million yuan, a new high price. Red beans rose by another 200,000. Distilleries were actively using them. Corn rose by 100,000 yuan under the tight control of cargo owners. High-quality tea beans rose by 200,000, and medium-quality beans rose by 100,000. Red beans rose by 300,000. Sesame was stable. Medium-quality raw kernels rose by 500,000, and high-quality kernels rose by 1 million.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices rose sharply. As the prices of all grains rebounded, scattered households competed to buy, and sales in the street were brisk. Stacked single transactions were active. Broad bean oil initially opened at 14.9 million, and then reached 15.1 million, an increase of 1.1 million. A good barrel of raw oil reached 17 million, an increase of 1.5 million. Raw vegetable oil rose from 14 million to 14.4 million, also an increase of 1 million. Small cart sesame oil rose by 800,000, and bean cake rose by 130,000 to 140,000.</p>

<h3>No Flexibility in the Prohibition of Using Checks for Payment</h3>
<p>When interviewed by reporters yesterday, Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Administration Bureau, reiterated the previous statement that the prohibition of using checks for payment on the same day will be strictly enforced starting from June 1st. He stated that there will be no flexibility. Regarding rumors that the Industrial Association will petition again for this matter, he said that he welcomes people from the industrial and commercial sectors to study this issue with him. He continued that even if all checks for payment on the same day are used, customers with sufficient bank deposits will not be affected in their turnover and credit. This is because certified checks and drafts are not subject to the restriction on use.</p>
<h3>Priority Procedures for the Allocation of Oil Materials</h3>
<p>The National Economic Commission recently telegraphed the Industrial and Mining Auxiliary Office regarding the allocation ratio of goods and materials, artificial silk, and oil materials in Annex (2) of the May-June period, which has been decided. It also notified importers and factory users that if there are any unresolved issues, a meeting can be convened to discuss them. The priority procedures for the allocation of oil materials are as follows: Gasoline (1) public utilities, (2) transportation vehicles or ships, (3) production machinery, (4) industrial raw materials, (5) private vehicles, (6) others. Diesel: (1) public utilities, (2) ships, (3) diesel engines or vehicles, (4) boiler fuel for industries related to exports, (5) factory boiler fuel that cannot easily be converted to coal, (6) public oil stoves.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Control Committee Allocates Yarn: Resolution of the Unified Tax Issue, Deducting from Yarn Price First</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Control Committee previously submitted two proposals to the Central Bank regarding the issue of the cotton yarn unified tax of the Executive Yuan: (1) The storage rent and insurance costs before the end of May this year are to be borne by the yarn factory. (2) The date of the storage receipt at the time of the contract is to be extended by 40 days (the 20 days extended due to the cotton issue have been included) as the deadline for calculating the unified tax period. The unified tax before this deadline is to be borne by the yarn factory, and the increased unified tax after this deadline is to be borne by the Central Bank. It has now been learned that the Central Bank has agreed to the second proposal, but the first proposal is to ask the Cotton Yarn Control Committee to negotiate directly with the yarn factory and consider extending the deadline appropriately.</p>
<p>After the resolution of the above tax burden issue, the Cotton Yarn Control Committee has decided that starting tomorrow (the 24th), for the Executive Yuan cotton yarn allocated by the China Textile Corporation on behalf of the committee, the portion of the unified tax that should be borne by the government will be deducted from the yarn price first, and the customer will directly pay it to the factory after obtaining the allocation. In the future, customers will not have any further delays in picking up yarn.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was invigorated due to the easing of credit among fellow businesses, and buyers from Tianjin, Austria, and other regions were more eager. The 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by 7 million yuan as soon as the agricultural bank opened. As soon as the market opened, the China Textile Corporation announced a sealed bid sale, and the market sentiment softened immediately, with prices falling to a low of 288 million. Later, many replica makers took advantage of small lots to absorb yarn, and the market rebounded. Near closing, it rose to the 300 million yuan mark, an increase of 18 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also generally rose by 4 million to 5 million to 16 million to 17 million due to strong demand from both local customers and retail buyers.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Hovering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was characterized by sluggish buying and selling, and fellow businesses generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Dyeing factories also absorbed little, and only the broad market and retail buyers did some intermittent trading. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially rose by 40,000 to 50,000 after opening, and finally closed at 6.83 million yuan, an increase of only 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other cloths were still relatively stable. It is also reported that the China Textile Corporation supplied and sold cloth, three kinds of bed sheets, and fine cloth with a Blue Peacock listed price of 6.44 million yuan, with an additional 100,000 yuan for the purchase order. Finally, the price of Longtou fine cloth rose to 7 million yuan, and there were sales of goods on Monday.</p>
<h3>Sales of Woolen Fabrics are Brisk</h3>
<p>Although woolen fabrics have turned from rising to stable, and from stable to weak, sellers are still holding onto high prices, while buyers are looking for prices to fall. However, woven fabrics and cloths were quite brisk yesterday, with strong demand from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. There were many direct and indirect transactions at the tea party. Peifeng white canvas was traded at 450,000 yuan per yard, Kai 277 French lining was 170,000 yuan, Hua Yi beige linen cloth was 230,000 yuan, white-gray was 260,000 yuan, ordinary rainproof cloth was generally shouted at 6.35 million yuan, flower cloth was 300,000 yuan, and American mercerized khaki was 2.5 million to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Lu Zhuang Fine Eyebrow Tea will be Launched Soon</h3>
<p>Although the negotiations on domestic sales of tea yesterday were not hidden, the two sides maintained their own attitudes, resulting in less active trading than the previous day. In this situation, the trend was undulating and narrow, still presenting a consolidating pattern. However, the specialty product from the bottom of the empty tiger in the 36th year finally took the lead, and at the close, each was increased by 5 million yuan. As for the foreign-owned tea market, exporters' buying interest still invaded the market, but they still used their sharp blades to slash prices. However, because of cost considerations, they continued to be reluctant to part with their goods, resulting in a situation that remained as calm as before. According to fellow traders, the Wenzhou Fine Eyebrow tea of Lu Zhuang this year has been inspected by the Xia Chang Tea Company, and it is expected to be launched soon.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Allocation Prices for Next Week</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau has tentatively determined the allocation prices for artificial silk for next week as follows: 2A Toyo 324.4 million yuan, Tianqiao and others 332.8 million yuan, 2A Toyo 327.8 million yuan, Tianqiao and others 321.62 million yuan, 3A Toyo 317.7 million yuan, Tianqiao and others 316.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Stocks Continue to Prosper, Unified Bonds Rebound Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to rise yesterday. Meiya was stronger because of the news of new stock issuance, while some foreign stocks did not rise but declined. The market was still mediocre except for Yongsha. The morning started with stable sentiment. Yongsha opened at 2,940 yuan, then rose to 2,960 yuan, and then sold to a low price of 2,890 yuan. The agency fee opened high at 37 yuan and 41 yuan, and although it was stable after entering, it was still volatile. It rose to 2,995 yuan. News that Meiya would change to ex-rights trading, with a unit of 500,000 shares, excited people and also rose. After making a profit at a high price, it fell to a low price of 2,940 yuan. Foreign stocks were very popular, and numbers 152, 157, 14, and 13 continued to be hyped up, rising to 2,980 yuan. After numbers 160, 89, 178, 56, and 220 were closed, the afternoon closed at 2,960 yuan. Compared with the previous close, Meiya Tongyi Datong rose by half, Huochai Zhongni rose by 10%, Xinhua Commerce Xinguang Zhongxing Huaxin Shangping, Huafeng Yonggong Jingyao Zhongsi slightly fell, and the rest rose slightly.

<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Continued to rise yesterday. The assembly place at Nongkai was monitored by police officers, but the buying interest did not diminish. Yisha rose from 5.2 million to 5.45 million after opening before fluctuating slightly. The buying of steel expanded, rising a lot, approaching the 1.4 million mark, and there was less supply than demand. As a result, compared with the previous close, Jardine Matheson was flat, British Alliance rose slightly, and Yisha Yeguang Papermill and Yisha Beer Shipping each rose by half to one percent or less, while steel rose by more than 10%.</p>
<h3>Although There Were Differences in Advances, Bank Credit Still Appeared Loose</h3>
<p>[Report from China United News Agency] Bank credit in Shanghai was loose again yesterday. Although the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury still had differences in advances, they only amounted to 466.1 billion. The market sentiment was therefore more invigorated, and the dark interest rate also gradually fell to around three corners. However, according to the Financial Administration Bureau, the authorities will continue to tighten credit. If necessary, they will not relax until the situation is unprecedentedly tight. Among the differences in advances of the banks and bureaus yesterday, the Central Bank had an advance of 216.81 billion, the Bank of China had an advance of 63.9 billion, the Bank of Communications had a difference of 221.6 billion, the Farmers Bank had an advance of 31.6 billion, the Post Office Savings Bureau had an advance of 6.96 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had an advance of 4.84 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had an advance of 200 million.

<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Huadong National Goods Department Store Opens</h3>

This time, in order to connect with domestic factories, Mr. Cai has established a Huadong branch in Shanghai, which is scheduled to open today.</p>
<h3>The Tung Oil and Pig Bristle Market is Firm, the Bristle Industry Crisis is Urgent and Should Encourage Increased Production</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau recently released the tung oil and pig bristle market conditions for the past week as follows: The overseas tung oil market continued to be firm this week. New York spot prices were US$0.25 per pound, equivalent to US$0.24 C&amp;F, with many transactions. Paint factories' inventories are gradually depleted and are eager to buy. The futures market for June, July, and August is quite active. Hong Kong oil prices are reasonable, only HK$145.50 per sima dan, so London prices are low. Barrelled oil is £179 per long ton CIF. Domestic market prices are Chongqing 11,200,000,000 yuan per city zu, Wanxian 12,000,000,000 yuan, Hankou 13,700,000,000 yuan, Shanghai 15,000,000,000 yuan, Guangzhou 15,900,000,000 yuan, and Wuzhou 16,000,000,000 yuan. The overseas pig bristle market was firm this week, but China's supply was scarce. Foreign importers and brush factories initially thought that China's foreign exchange policy would change soon. After the change, China's stockpiles would be shipped to the US in large quantities. The selling price of pig bristles in the US could be reduced, and they have not dared to import in large quantities for several months, only seeking to meet their needs. Now they have discovered that the number of supplies in our country has decreased, and the foreign exchange control methods are difficult to change, so they are eager to replenish. However, due to the exchange rate, the Sichuan ports cannot cover costs. Bristle factories only seek to preserve mature goods to maintain the value of the currency. They are not interested in acquiring raw materials and increasing production. This is a major crisis in the pig bristle industry, and it is extremely important to the foreign exchange income. It is urgently necessary to encourage increased production to prevent foreign brush factories from using substitutes due to the interruption of raw materials. On the other hand, the high overseas selling price of pig bristles is also not a good phenomenon. In order to maintain the sales of pig bristles, it is necessary to prevent substitutes from invading.

<h3>French Tram Company's Response to a Passenger Dispute Case on Route 24</h3>
<p>Re: Your department's forwarded letter from Mr. Shu _, we acknowledge receipt. After investigation by the company, it was found that Li Genfen (transliteration), a passenger on Route 24 trolleybus, falsely reported to the ticket seller and ticket inspector that she had a "pass" and did not purchase a ticket. The company firmly believes that the sender of the letter fabricated the facts to cover up her false reporting. Furthermore, she did not show a long-term ticket from the Shanghai Tram Company. The amount collected by the company's ticket inspector was not a fine, but a partial pre-payment for a long-term ticket. The company is now holding this amount for Mr. Li. We hereby respond to your inquiry, hoping you will take note! Sincerely, to the Shanghai Shen Bao Social Services Department.</p>

<h3>Telegram Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>Answered by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau</p>
<p>[Zhang Ziqiang from Jing'an Temple Road asks:] Which is the cheapest way to send international telegrams?</p>
<p>[Answer:] Code telegrams are the most economical and cost-effective. In addition to various internationally used commercial codes such as Peterson Code, Bentley Code, Acme Code, etc., the three-letter codes composed of English letters in the newly compiled code of the Ministry of Communications of China can be used by grouping them into five-letter sets. Add the word "Plain" to the first line of the telegram, and the fee is 60% of the regular telegram fee. The transmission order is the same as that of regular telegrams. Each telegram is calculated from five words, and if it is less than five words, it is also calculated as five words.</p>
<p>[Mr. Zhu Heyan from Kangding Road asks:] Our company sends out several telegrams every day. Can we settle the account monthly to save procedures?</p>
<p>[Answer:] If you want to avoid paying in cash each time or waiting for a long time when sending telegrams, please use the "pre-paid telegram sending" method. First, go to the main business office at No. 70 Suzhou Road of this bureau to pay a pre-paid telegram fee once. After that, you can send telegrams to various business offices at any time with the telegram receipt book, and the telegram fee will be settled at the end of the month.</p>

<h3>Saluting the Athletes of Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Ding Rongguan</p>
<p>"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth, the national flag flutters, the singing roars, the athletes of Taiwan dedicate their skills, New Taiwan, new heroes, washing away the sick man of East Asia, a strong country must first have a strong people, forging a strong body, this is the master of the nation!"</p>
<p>——Song for Taiwan Athletes Participating in the National Games.</p>
<p>The magnificent 7th National Games has come to a close. For days, the wind and rain continued, and Jiangwan Road has regained its desolation. One feels the departure of people and the emptiness of the arena! In this National Games, although some regrettable and unpleasant things did happen, on the other hand, we also saw a gratifying bright side. Within ten days, nearly twenty men's and women's track and field and swimming records were broken, which is an extremely brilliant achievement. In terms of the units participating in the Games, there were overseas Chinese who traveled across the ocean from the south and fighters from the war zones in the north who overcame difficulties and dangers, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and solidarity. Among them, what we admire most and what has set the best example is the style of the athletes from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan is our country's first territory to fall into enemy hands. For forty years, they have tasted all the sufferings of the world. Now that they have suddenly returned to the motherland, we feel a mixture of sorrow and joy! Their perseverance and law-abiding virtues have moved us deeply. In this National Games, they came as a team and left as a team. They performed short warm-up exercises before the competition, with a beginning and an end, day after day for more than ten days, which was truly refreshing. It is no wonder that such a disciplined and community-minded team has repeatedly won championships in competitions. To be honest, without the participation of the athletes from Taiwan, the achievements of this Games would have been greatly inferior! Furthermore, the spirit of sports lies in the manifestation of discipline. Their adherence to rules and obedience, even apart from their excellent records, is an absolutely perfect success! After the closing of the Games, 118 male and female athletes from Taiwan Province who participated in the National Games left Shanghai on the 17th to visit Hangzhou. The next day, a Hangzhou newspaper reported the news of the Taiwan athletes' arrival in Hangzhou, which stated: "The train arrived at the city station at 11:55 a.m. The athletes were all dressed in black wool jackets and white trousers, with a green shield-shaped armband on their left arm, embroidered with a yellow 'Tai' character. Each carried a simple piece of luggage. After getting off the train in order, they automatically lined up and exited the station in an orderly manner. The good order aroused the surprise of the station staff and passengers on the same train. Shen Mulian, the manager of the Hangzhou branch of the China Travel Service, who was responsible for the reception, also believed that this was the first time this year that the agency had hosted such a large group, and the orderly manner, without requiring them to worry, was unprecedented!" (See the Southeast Daily, Hangzhou Edition, May 18th.) Since the victory, the lack of order among the Chinese people has become a trend. The vibrant "New Life Movement" of more than ten years ago is almost gone, and the decline of morality is no more serious than today! If we want to be among the ranks of first-class powers, we must have the demeanor of first-class citizens. We must strive for unity, and organize ourselves. Sports is the best way to train this spirit. It is hoped that the performance of the athletes from Taiwan this time will be the beginning of the Chinese people's attention to sports and public morality, which would be extremely fortunate!</p>
<h3>Doubts About Zhang Zhidong Killing His Wife</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Zheng Yiwei's "Mystery of Zhang Nanpi's Angry Killing of His Wife" in Free Talk. He recorded the Nanpi killing his wife in the book "Record of Character Appraisal." After receiving a letter from Jiang Shiyao of Guangzhou, he checked Nanpi's Chronicle and said that there was no such thing. Mr. Zheng also doubted the authenticity of his statement. The "Zhang Zhidong Family Letters" published by the workshop, which Mr. Zheng cited, I have also seen, and it does mention the killing of his wife, which does not seem to be a forgery. In the novel "Flower in a Sea of Sins" by Zeng Mengpu, the incident is also alluded to, and Zhidong's behavior is described in a very obscene manner. Chen Shiyi, the teacher who wrote the biography of Zhidong, said that Zhidong was short in stature, unlike a northerner, with a broad forehead and bright eyes, and his hands reached his abdomen, depicting his appearance with subtle criticism. His lack of private virtue is known to everyone. Yan Laoren also told me that the description in "Flower in a Sea of Sins" was not an exaggeration. Zhidong wrote five elegiac poems (with a note lamenting the death of his wife, Ms. Shi of Guangzhou), and here are the third and fifth poems: "I often lose my wine due to my friends, and I am happy to imitate the reclusive; today I am with Jing Gao again, who will admonish Bo Lun on the pillow?" "The empty room is cold and desolate, and I realize my mistakes every year. The village road and the house plan are inferior to Du Duan, what is the use of wearing the girdle to find Xian Wei." The meaning of repentance is expressed in the words. Mr. Jiang argued that the Chronicle of Zhang said that it was not true, and it is necessary to re-examine it and must speculate on the origin of the rumors. Unfortunately, there are no books on hand. After borrowing the Complete Works of Zhang Wenxiang, I will write another article to determine it. Mr. Zheng, would you also be interested in this?</p>
<h3>Coincidence</h3>
<p>— Ding Ling</p>
<p>A British iron merchant named Henning was born on the same day and at the same time as King George III in 1738. The day Henning opened his business was exactly the day George III ascended the throne. The two also married on the same day and had nine sons and six daughters. Finally, the two died at the same moment on January 29, 1820.</p>
<h3>Women and Watches</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>If ladies did not use watches, the repair business of clock and watch shops all over the world would definitely suffer a severe blow. This is not to say that women use watches more than men, but that women's watches break more easily than men's. However, this is not to prove that women's watches are made poorly, but that they are used improperly.</p>
<p>According to records, women's watches break at least twice as often as men's watches. According to a study by the New York "Jewelry Workers Union," they said: "Women's purses are the root of broken watches." This judgment is authoritative. Even now, many women put their watches in their purses - even wristwatches. And purses are also the hiding place for perfumes, powders, grease, cigarettes, and other difficult items. Perfume is one of the real culprits.</p>
<p>All kinds of perfumes contain volatile oils. The volatilized oil mixes with the powder and other dust in the purse, and spreads everywhere, penetrating everywhere. Although the watch is tightly sealed, it is difficult to resist the "drilling" of the "oil slurry." Once they drill into the watch, they will hinder the movement of the machine, and then the watch will stop.</p>
<p>Although a woman carefully takes off her wristwatch when swimming, bathing, or doing laundry, she cannot guarantee that her wristwatch will not rust. When cooking, the water vapor sprayed from the pot and teapot will drill into the watch and quickly condense, resulting in the watch rusting. Also, the axles of the machines in the watch are coated with a thin layer of oil. Under normal conditions, this layer of oil can last for a year. However, every time it approaches heat, such as cooking by the stove, some of the oil in the watch will dry out, and the friction of the shaft will increase, thus shortening the life of the watch. - However, if any lady is so scared by reading this article that she does not dare to cook, it is really unnecessary. The advice I offer here is: do not wear a watch when cooking.</p>
<h3>Amidst Layoffs</h3>
<p>— Sun He</p>
<p>I heard that the government will continue to streamline redundant agencies and lay off staff in various provinces and cities after the implementation of the constitution. This is a wise measure for the government to simplify administration and save money, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, for those who are laid off, it cannot but be a problem.</p>
<p>From the perspective of those being laid off: some are complaining that the layoffs are unfair, and some are presenting their own performance evaluations to prove that they should not be laid off, and that the reason for the layoff is that there is no way to handle personnel matters. Regarding this, I think it is another issue. Let us assume that everything is fair, and those being laid off are mostly those who are not working hard, but there are still some points worth considering.</p>
<p>One is why these civil servants are not working hard? Are they indulging in pleasure and ease? Then indulging in pleasure and ease requires an environment for indulging in pleasure and ease. If there is, they should not be held responsible - to be honest, today, most civil servants are barely making ends meet. Being able to solve the problem of supporting their parents and raising their children is a supreme blessing. Do they still have the energy to indulge in pleasure? To put it more bluntly: the instability of life, being anxious all day long, and being busy borrowing money or trying to find a way are the facts. Then, making those whose lives are unstable lose their jobs, it is simple and straightforward, but will these people live or not?</p>
<p>Regarding these laid-off people, where will they go after receiving a small amount of severance pay? There are three ways: one is to find a job in another agency. Then, they will still return to the government. Instead of letting them grope in the dark, why not arrange them in a coordinated manner? One is to muddle through in this society, using some improper methods to maintain the livelihood of their families. This probably does not need us to make a judgment. One is to try to do business. There are already too many people doing business. Are we going to train some businessmen to develop commerce? I think there is no need to say more about whether it is right or wrong.</p>
<p>In short, during the period of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, it is already a "miracle" to have redundant and useless civil servants who are dismissed, but those who are working in the government are encountering unemployment. Is it because the mobilization is too much and there is an excess?</p>
<h3>Also Talking About Writing Habits</h3>
<p>— Guo Ping</p>
<p>Mark Twain liked to write in bed. Sometimes, when he was half-asleep and got inspiration, he didn't have time to get paper, so he immediately used a colored pen to write the main text on the pillowcase, because if he delayed it, he would forget everything. Therefore, Mark Twain loved beds the most, because he thought beds were the best thing in the world.</p>
<p>Before Chekhov wrote anything, he always recorded what he saw and heard in a small diary. He didn't like to make up novels, unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The British nautical novelist Jack London of the late 19th century always predetermined the content and chapter order of the story a year before writing a novel, and then wrote continuously every day, from about 1,000 words to 2,000 words per day.</p>
<p>Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote fairy tales, liked to write standing up because he suffered from fainting. If he fainted while standing, he could fall on the floor with a thud, so that the people downstairs could hear him, otherwise no one would come to save him.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The National Assembly brings together people from all over the country and all ethnic groups. The number of people is large, and the gathering has a statutory time limit. Therefore, in addition to the formal gathering at the venue, there are various commemorative gatherings, which are very grand events. According to the old city, people from all walks of life in politics, business, and academia also meet from all over the world. There are usually gatherings of the same year, gatherings of the same hometown, gatherings of classmates and colleagues, etc., to make connections and strengthen special friendships. However, I heard that there is also a "same-sex" cordial meeting in this National Assembly, which is an innovation. In the past, members of parliament and officials of various departments were all monopolized by one "sex", but now they are shared by both "sexes", and women are still a relatively small minority, so it is natural and necessary to increase this meeting.</p>
<p>On the chairman's stage of the National Assembly, women representatives have taken the chair several times. According to telegrams from newspapers in Pingjin, they all praised their gentle demeanor and orderly maintenance of order. Although this does not necessarily mean that women are better than men, it is enough to make men reflect! Silently observing the "boo!" and "bang!" sounds in the previous conferences in the north, most of them came from the male seats, while the female seats were mostly quiet. They only smiled at these strange sounds and appearances. I don't know what the situation is in the Nanjing conference this time, but I don't think it will be an exception. May I ask the attendees and listeners who are on the scene, is the group of dignified representatives, the seat of the magnificent National Assembly, whose specialty is a "boo", male or female? Is it that "boo" is the only way to show the male's "special skill"? I also heard that some male representatives complained that the order of the meeting was too bad, and in addition to strange sounds, there were occasional overstepping words and actions. They proposed setting up a "Discipline Committee" to be in charge of impeachment, and advocated that female representatives be the executors. Although this remark may have caused some unconscious laughter, it is not a casual joke, and it is enough to be a reflection of the male's inner feelings. Women are inferior to men in "boo" and "bang". In terms of abiding by the law and enforcing the law, they may not be inferior, or even better than men.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from Yun Jian's Calligraphy and Painting Topics (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Radish</p>
<p>Someone who saw Bai Jiu's painting said: Why not use rice to mix lead? I replied: Although He Lang is white, he has no powder, and he can't get the rouge of the jade building. How can he be Zhu Zhu Bai Bai, like the son of the Song family, so that his sister can climb the wall and peep? The Red Pine Village man in December of Xinwei.</p>
<p>Radish</p>
<p>This big earth puff pastry, one from Anzhou and one from Xinyang, weighs five or six catties each, tastes crisp and sweet, and grows in the sand; those that grow in wet land are firm and spicy, difficult to eat and unpalatable. I respectfully send it to Madam Bi to taste the new ones. My family has a collection of 10,000 dans, so this is nothing.</p>
<p>Radish</p>
<p>Today it is poisonous and hot, and I am very thirsty. I thought of radish but couldn't get it, so I wrote this. The meaning is to imitate Cao Cao's driving, pointing to the plum grove from afar. Da Chi in Gengwu.</p>
<p>Radish</p>
<p>It was originally painted as red radish, but unexpectedly it became white radish. Mr. Bai Jiao inscribed it: Do not learn the pretense of village girls, thickly applying rouge.</p>
<p>Radish</p>
<p>Half a catty of radish, a pair of fragrant mushrooms. Shopping for New Year's goods at the end of the twelfth lunar month of Gengwu. Bai Jiao jokingly inscribed it.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>After painting this orchid, I replanted two roots of thorns. My wife scolded and said: Are there thorns in this place too? I smiled and said: Where is there no such thing!</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>A Lai is four years old. When he saw me painting, he hurriedly climbed onto the peach tree and sat on a corner of the table, holding his breath and staring intently. He always said: It's not like it. This bat was also identified by my A Lai, so it is said that it is not a team.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Someone who saw me writing this said: Its flowers want to smile, its leaves have an unsatisfied meaning, and its stones are majestic. I said: What you see is emotion, my pen is alive! But there are still things that cannot be understood, so ask for them from the formless. Bo Lao ordered me to write it, and I respectfully offer it to Bo Can.</p>
<p>Fragrance</p>
<p>Six taels of fragrance, two qian of fragrance companions, cooked together, its taste is fragrant forever, great and boundless. How about I respectfully offer it to Uncle Shi Zi for lunch?</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Holding purity and containing fragrance, the hometown of Bai Yun, not dressed for the times, who is he who seals me as king!</p>
<p>This work is similar to ancient white but detached, light and fragrant forever, the soul of the poet has a place to rest, and it should be composed by one Jiao.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Si Weng wrote Oulan, lying south of the paper. Or it is pointed out as someone who cherishes ink like gold, Yun Jian said: Is it as good as Xiao Fu Wenrong?</p>
<p>Frosty air at the tip of the pen, Xiang soul under the moon, he who understands my intention is the World Honored One.</p>
<p>Mr. Yunjian Han, guests often find it difficult to get what they want. Venerable Fan once said: If a red sleeve grinds the ink, everyone can be happy! This monk has a comprehension and can learn Buddhism. It seems that it is not necessary for him to return to secular life. What does Master Xuedu think?</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Writing does not necessarily mean talking about sects, and there is a natural flight in the signature. Nanchuan commented on Shanquiao and said: The ultimate in calmness turns into etherealness. This statement is uniquely insightful.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Fan Kuan first studied under Li Cheng, and then sighed and said: It is better to learn from nature than to learn from people! This sentence breaks the chaos of the painting family.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Sparse is not easy, dense is not easy, neither sparse nor dense, also sparse and also dense, how to get the method? It is not that I have no teachings, the writer said: There is no fixed method in writing.</p>
<p>Orchid is not easy to be dense, and it is not easy to be sparse, who will understand the meaning of the grandson of Chu?</p>
<p>Red Orchid</p>
<p>Emei Su Dongpo wrote red bamboo, and eight hundred years later, Yun Jian had Bai Jiao who wrote red orchids.</p>
<p>Orchid</p>
<p>Someone asked about the orchid, Yun Jian said: The flower is easy, the leaf is difficult, the pen is easy, the ink is difficult, the momentum is easy, the time is difficult, the shape is easy, and the rhyme is difficult. The momentum is in being fast without being hurried, then you get the pen, the time is in being moist without being dry, then you get the ink, and the shape is in having no intentional pretension and being full of posture, then the rhyme is complete. Orchid</p>
<p>Orchid's quality is in the level shoulders, and the painting takes momentum, just like writing which avoids laying out straight. Writing orchids with all the flowers as pointed petals is also not knowing those of noble quality in orchids.</p>
<p>Orchid and Bamboo</p>
<p>It is difficult to write both orchids and bamboo, especially in medicine. However, I think the orchid may be more difficult than the bamboo, then a stroke of the leaf is not right, and the whole paper is ruined.</p>
<p>Both orchids and bamboo come from writing, writing without painting, and the brushwork is particularly close. However, both are not easy. Yu said, "Orchids for three years, bamboo for a lifetime", also said, "Bamboo for three years, orchids for a lifetime", which can be seen.</p>
<p>Wind Orchid</p>
<p>I often write orchids and I am quite proud of myself, so I do it again, but five or six papers are not similar. It is known that my teacher and I cannot be imitated, who wants to imitate me, please refer to this purpose!</p>
