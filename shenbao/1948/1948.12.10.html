<h3 id="c1">蚌宿戰局漸入新階段　南下兵團兩處大捷　永城東北殲菲共達兩萬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠九日電〕今日此間剿總於京滬慰勞團抵蚌之次日，首次發布一大捷戰訊稱：南下兵團今晨於永城東北魯樓一帶，擊潰陳匪之第三縱隊，另於郝寨·戈樓·陶閣一帶，對匪亦予以打擊，兩處戰塲匪傷亡在兩萬以上。又，今日方治於慰勞空軍時，此間空軍某負責人曾表示整個戰塲今無特殊變化。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠九日電〕蚌宿戰局似又漸次入一新階段，北上李兵團連日以鉗形攻勢，對當面之陳匪六縱隊，劉匪二縱隊，展開痛擊，今日右鉗攻克火神廟據點，何集方面亦向西追擊，左鉗則在古城·石莊（均在懷遠北偏西三十五華里）一棧，與匪對峙中。由於李兵團之北指，匪對黃兵團陣地東南側之壓力已大爲减輕，日來該兵團正向李兵團方面以攻擊方式逐漸靠攏。據今晚消息，該部今日擊潰當面兩個團匪之阻抗後，攻克十數村落，其陣地已擴展至潺河南岸，與李兵團兩鉗間距離均祗有行軍一日之路程（約六一華里）。一般觀測，在兩兵團全面攻擊下，黃李會師已不過時間問題，今後戰事重心，或將轉至南下兵團方面。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠九日電〕杜聿明將軍統率南下之龐大兵團，九日晨於永城東北魯樓一帶，擊潰共匪三個縱隊，匪傷亡一萬以上，遺棄於國軍陣地前之屍體達八千餘具。同時，在魯樓以北之郝寨·戈樓·陶閣一帶，亦殲匪萬餘，綜計此兩方面共傷斃匪兩萬餘名。殘匪經此重創，全綫已呈動搖狀態。此項輝煌戰果，係剿總劉總司令，九日晨十時於總部接受京滬三慰勞團獻呈錦旗及禮單後所宣佈者。劉總司令並望慰勞團及隨行新聞界人士以所部將士用命，確保江淮，扭轉大局之決心轉達後方同胞。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠九日電〕由豫南北上之張淦兵團，進抵阜陽已證實，縣城收復。張部先頭隊至蒙城，將與宿縣南北大兵團夾擊匪軍。又，在雙堆集附近苦戰旬餘之黃維兵團一部，現轉至有利地帶，漸獲優勢，可能卽與李延年劉汝明兩兵團會師。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠九日電〕我協同向東南挺進之黃兵團裝甲戰車部隊，九日攻克楊莊·李莊匪據點，斃匪千餘名。</p>
<p>〔聯合社蚌埠九日電〕國軍方面今日消息：華東區共軍以彈藥缺乏，現正採用「車輪戰術」。陳毅部隊現正退後，由劉伯承部上前作戰。待劉部彈藥缺乏時退下補給，再由陳部上前作戰。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠九日電〕軍息：（一）土共孫專家部千餘，七日午後竄抵滁縣西北三十五華里之硃龍橋，護路部隊已加注意，昨晚鐵路有小破壞，路局已派工程隊搶修。（二）竄至盱眙西南河梢橋之匪江淮獨立旅陳慶先部三千餘人，經國軍某部出擊，已向附近山地逃竄。另悉，新橋站以東之九灣集附近刻竄到匪一股。</p>

<p>〔中央社蚌埠九日電〕劉總司令峙九日向訪問蚌埠之京滬記者縱談目前戰避稱：宿蚌會戰中，國軍已獲初步勝利，渠呼籲大後方人士，應掃除失敗心理。劉氏　：徐州會戰，因爲國軍將士用命，　殺奮勇，使陳毅匪部損失二十萬人，知難而退，徐州因此乃吿無恙。在徐州時，我曾說過，這一會戰並未結束，因爲劉伯誠，陳賡兩股匪，由華中戰塲轉移到蘇豫皖邊區，徐州會戰時，他們卽乘隙南竄宿縣，截斷我徐蚌交通，並圓進窺淮河，徐州會戰吿一段落之後，陳毅殘餘力量大部份亦南竄宿縣以東地區，國軍爲集中兵力，消滅匪之主力，乃放棄徐州，以全力與匪搏鬥，這就是一般人所謂「宿蚱會戰」。劉氏繼稱：宿蚌會戰現正在激烈進行中，初步勝利雖然已屬諸國軍，但尙未到決定階段，將來如果能得到我們所預期的戰果，則不僅江淮可保卽黃河以南亦無大問題，如果打平手，我們也可固守進河。當然我們希望南北兩面的國軍將士，能够盡最大的努力，舊勇衝殺，能獲得最大的戰果。至於或者有人疑慮這一會戰的結果，國軍倘若失敗，又將如何？關於這一點，我從來沒有想過，因爲當面匪的力量我很淸楚，國軍的力量我更淸楚，我深信我所指揮的國軍，不至於那樣脆弱無能。諸位先生有在徐州前綫看過他們作戰的，就知道我這個話是有根據的，因此我要求諸位先生，共同來掃除這種悲觀失敗主義。（慰勞團在蚌勞軍消息及國防部政工局發表之「一週戰局」均刊第二版）</p>
<h3 id="c3">合衆社記者　前綫所見 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社記者諾柴葛曹老集前綫九日電〕記者於八日乘軍用車自蚌埠來曹老集，晤及第六兵團參謀長梁同心（譯音），據梁將軍稱：共軍三萬人結集於距此間西北八英哩之張八營至何集之綫，曹老集現爲第六集團軍總部所在地。記者與梁將軍縱談片刻後，卽隨軍赴前綫，所經村莊，十室九空，斷垣殘壁，餘火未熄，戰跡歷歷在目，迨抵距前綫四英哩之胡長淸軍總部，前方戰火方殷，傷兵分批自前綫撤下，國軍衣着糧食，均甚優良，配備齊整，有美式卡平槍，及一〇五厘米口徑之迫擊砲等。記者並晤見共軍俘虜，其衣着給養，亦殊不惡，渠等稱：「陳毅在一個月前曾對我們訓話，說我們在三個月內可以打入南京，在作戰時，每日三餐，但行軍太多，我們在夜間長途跋涉，日間則在田野及戰壕內暫作休息。」</p>
<h3 id="c4">冀東軍情步驟　平津唐三角區將揭開主力戰　張垣外圍菲已成弩末 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報唐山九日電〕冀東軍情步步趨緊。據此間官方情報，唐山週邊匪一部西移，林匪三縱隊調集遵化，九·十一兩縱隊各一部兵力三萬集踞玉田，七·九縱隊一部仍屯駐豐潤西北，運日匪大量卡軍向玉田·薊縣境輸運補給。綜觀目前冀東局勢，近由於平綏·平保·平古各綫匪軍竄擾，冀東會戰前奏曲實已開始，醞釀中之決定性主力戰，判斷可能在平津唐三角地帶之三河·薊縣·寳坻地區揭幕。</p>
<p>〔本報唐山九日電〕　西國軍掃蕩戰得手，北寗綫卑家店車站附近土共警八·十兩團各一部，昨被國軍完全擊潰，並攻克卑家店東南之七百戶村，國軍正乘勝淸剿雷莊林西地區殘匪。另據此間報載，林匪後續入關部隊，其先頭部隊昨已進抵灤縣城。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約九日廣播：華盛頓訊：杜魯門總統頃吿記者稱，太星期五招待蔣夫人之茶會中，渠將與蔣夫人討論中國要求美國增加援助一事。渠預料蔣夫人將提出三項要求：（一）美國每年援華十億美元，以三年爲期，此項援助主要爲軍事性質，（二）請美國派遣更强有力之顧問團來華，並請派一聲望卓著之將領，來華協助政府與共黨作戰，（三）請美國重申中·美二國之團結一致。或問此次茶會後總統是否將與蔣夫人續作會商，總統稱尙未定奪。或間可否請總統敦促蔣夫人舉行一次記者招待會，杜氏稱：此事最好由記者逕向蔣夫人請求。又一記者稱，蔣夫人前次來美時，曾與羅斯福總統聯合招待記者，杜氏稱，當時渠並未在塲。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕代理國務卿羅維特八日再度避不答覆新聞記者等關於蔣夫人活動情形之問題，羅氏稱：渠未悉蔣夫人之朱來計劃，亦不知蔣夫人與馬歇爾兩次會談之內容。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日電〕蔣夫人今日翩然蒞臨聯合援華會華盛頓委員會主辦之聖誕義賣會，對中國友人在戰時與目前對我國之援助，表示謝意。義賣會由顧維鈞大使失人揭幕。華府社交界貴婦名媛參加者數百人。對蔣夫人皆極誠歡迎情况熱烈。夫人致詞曰：「余欲對多年來，恒以中國爲念之友人謹致謝意，君等之義舉，已深入我中國人民之心腑。渠等對諸君歷久不衰之協助，至爲感激。此次義賣會尤爲我人所銘感。諸君因對中國人民之福利，具有厚愛，故有此盛舉。而諸君對全世界鬥爭中所受威脅者何，亦具有眞實之知識與關懷」。今日義賣會中，聯合援華會華盛頓委員會主席布魯克斯夫人致詞，對蔣夫人表示歡迎，並祝夫人此行獲致極大成就。布夫人並代表美方中國友人曰：吾人保證勇往直前，盡量繼續援華。蔣夫人於今日下午特以藍色錦帳一幅，贈獻該會。杜魯門總統夫人亦於午後蒞會參觀，並購物品數件。本屆義賣會之收入，預料校去年更爲豐富，其款項將由美國敎會，於週內分致美方友人所支援之各醫院，醫藥所，孤兒院，合作社等。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕關於立院根據劉不同氏提案，歷半載研審折衝始修正通過之臨時財產稅條例，業經政院飭據財部議覆，認爲有　難行，呈經總統核可，於日前移請立院覆議，此項咨文已列入十日立院例會提出報吿，程序委會意見爲將之交付財金委會審查，茲誌咨文中引述之財部議覆理由如次：「查臨時財產稅之興辦，有助於目前收支之平衡，充裕戡亂之軍費，本屬開源之良策，卽就社會政策言，亦有平均負担之作用，符合民生主義之目標，惟綜核條例全文，其中對於徵課對象，財產登記及國外財產征課諸問題，仍尙不無研究之處，茲謹分別簡陳如次：（一）關於征課對象問題，原條例第八條規定，應納財產稅之財產，包括不動產及動產，其中或則原有賦課已多，不堪再予加重，或則本身利於隱匿，不易捕捉控制，例如土地一項，歷年田賦徵實，軍糧，民食均於此是賴，徵實之不足，又復徵購徵借，其現有負荷不可謂不重，而城市之土地亦有地價稅增値稅之征收，負祖亦不在輕，財產稅稅率特高，有無偌大餘力，似成問題。房屋一項，依現行法令規定，業主本無收入，而且房捐及財產租賃所得稅而外，各種地方攤雜不一而足，此項重稅，亦恐不易勝任。又如動產之中，金，銀，外幣，外匯以及現款，珠寳等，固均無由調查，卽存款證券債權投資等項，或則本屬不記名，或則雖經記名，因大都假託，等於不記名，如何能調查確實，方法上亦有考慮。至於貨物及交通工具等項，何者應予課稅，何者應予免征，界限難分，調查手續亦極繁，如何始能執簡馭繁，均有詳酌妥定之必要。（二）關於財產登記問題，我國對於人民財產之登記，向未統一辦理，各機關爲推行某種主管業務之需要所登記辦法亦多簡陋　斷，而且隨辦隨廢，資料散失，原條例十四·十五兩條規定，由納稅人自行申報繳稅，一面由徵收機關會同原辦財政登記機關登記其財產，並進行調查估價之手續，能否收到實效，似難確言，縱有督導機關提名限報之規定，政府旣無登記資料稽考，卽不易令人民自動實報，提名亦似徒然，總之，人民財產未經先辦登記，逕予進行課徵，有無欲速不達之嫌，亦當再予斟酌。（三）關於國外財產徵課問題，與論每謂富豪之財產頗多遠逸國外者，故徵收國人在國外之存款或征購征借外匯資產之呼聲，迄未休止，惟政府過去一再向英·美交涉登記國人存款，猶無結果，似更不易進而徵稅。條例第一條及第八條，對於國人在國外之財　　產，亦均規定征收，如何着手進行，自須在外交方面先有充分準備，方能期收宏效，至於外人在國內之財產，原條例亦規定一併髁稅，是否將引起其他糾紛，似亦頗値顧慮，以上三端，關係財產稅之成敗，似必先加考慮，而後始能進行，不然，救濟特捐之玆例重演一次，不特無補於財政，而輿論界之責難又必紛紛而起，屆時政府之困難，不難想像也。本部以爲舉辦財產稅雖爲開源良策，縱有種種困難，亦應力謀克服，惟現値軍事緊張之際，社會動盪之時，是否宜於卽時開征，似不無應行斟酌之處」。</p>

<h3 id="c16">社論　新內閣將怎樣「新」法？ <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>新行政院長孫科氏的任命，由立法院通過至今已歷旬餘。其間孫院長會接見記者及上海各界代表，發表談話，以團結各方力量，博採人民意見，改革過去政風，挽救當前危機爲其組閣的主旨。中外人士，聽到孫院長這些坦白談話，都寄以極大的希望。嗣後孫院長雖因療治腿瘤，就醫休養，不免躭誤了新閣組織的進行，但昨天中樞大員雲集上海，與孫院長磋商新閣人選，據聞大致可能商定，又傳聞故都學者香港寓公均在羅致入閣之列，可見此「千呼萬喚始出來」的新內閣，不久當隨孫院長之進京而呱呱墮地了。</p>
<p>中國今天已到了存亡絕續之交，不僅阻遏共產主義勢力膨脹的軍事勝敗爲中外人士所關心，即今後一切政治經濟的設施如何，也無不爲一般人所注目。的碓，中國的中樞，在這一個多月，幾乎像是「無政府」的狀態，大家亂哄哄，令人有一盤散沙之感。幸而　蔣總統始終堅定，坐鎭京畿，津浦前綫將士浴血苦拚，士氣旺盛，纔算穩住了這個大局。然而與有國際背景的共產黨抗爭，決不當只恃元首鎭定之力，將士血肉之軀，而應該有一個堅强有力的「新」政府，延攬「新」人才，表示「新」作風，以領導全國社會上的「新」力量，樹立起中外人士對於這未來政府的「新」希望，然後可以收拾人心，挽回國運。故　總統之任命孫內閣，旣抱着「與民更始」的胸襟，孫院長自宜當仁不讓，負起這個「刷新政治」的大責任。</p>
<p>然則這個責任重大的新內閣，究竟應當怎樣「新」法，纔能勉副國人的期望呢？</p>
<p>第一，要負責任而不是坐衙門。　一個民主國家的內閣，必須先決定自己的政策，而對民意的立法機關負起執行其政策的責任，成敗得失，全須承當。負責任的是政治家；坐衙門的只是官僚而已！官僚的作風不外「推」「拖」兩字。一件事到他們手裏，不是請示，就是交擬；不是將責任推給上司，就是將責任諉之下屬。此即推字訣。其次一件事到甲機關，又牽涉到乙機關，更會轉連到丙機關，如此單位重重，互相咨商，主從不分，權責不明，牽來纏去，可以拖延一年半載，毫無結果。此乃拖字訣。中國政治之無效率，中國官員之無能，所以受此設評而無以自解者，全受此兩字之累！故孫內閣不欲革新政治則已，否則首先應該碓立責任內閣的制度，明定分層負責的權限，不許溺職，也不容越權，不許任何的推與拖，然後元首端拱於上，股肱輔弼於左右，有司百僚各勤其分內之事而無所推諉，中國政治始可煥然改觀，而人民乃能油然發生新的希望。</p>
<p>第二，要定政策而不是凑雜碎。　須知用新人行新政，是當今國人一般的期望，故用人的先決條件是對於政策的見解。孫院長負組閣的大命，明知時令艱難，而義不容辭，則必當於上台之前，衡量國內外的大勢，決定新閣對內對外的大政方針，然後選擇人才，必求其同意此方針者相與共同努力，方能如臂使指，發揮事半功倍的效能。誠然，舉黨一致，舉國一致，爲新閣所欲標榜的特點；但必須注意者，此「一致」之詞，乃有對政策一致之義，並非大家混在閣內各分杯羹之謂也。假使不問某人之政見如何，對某問題之主張如何，而但因其爲某黨某派某系之人物，一概拉攏之以入閣，則如果將來意見紛歧，彼此牽掣，新內閣復有何事可爲？故「一致」的內閣必須有中心，此中心必決定之於政策，否則不當謂之一致，只可名之爲「雜碎」。吾人決不希望中國當此危急存亡之秋，還再來一次雜碎內閣的試騐。</p>
<p>第三，要拔眞才而不是添奴才。這幾天的組閣聲中，不知幾多人在準備彈寇，幾多人在想望搬位，幾多人在　緣奔競。我們人民團然不願見若干對內對外慮　誤國責任的大僚戀棧不去，也不願見只有那麼幾尊　　裝在走馬燈裏，好像天下之大，人民之衆，祇有這些人物纔是人才，但同時更不願見一批膽大妄爲的書獃子在「用新人」的招牌之下，濫竽充數，尤其不願見身居高位者祗顧物色一班唯唯諾諾先意承旨的奴才，隱貽國家的大息。須知今天中國大局，猶人身之病已入膏育，起死回生，端賴學養有素能肩大任的國手，萬不能再任庸醫之試騐。尤其必須戒備者，萬不可讓貪汚成習，聲名有玷者混跡其中。在非常之時，負非常之任，固必須有非常之才；而非常之才的基礎還是建築在平正通達四個大字之上。惟平正，纔能不走行險僥倖之路；惟通達，纔能不蹈剛愎自用之危。平正通達，而更濟以公忠體國，出處有度的精神，纔是今天國家所急需的眞才。古人云：「得師者王，得友者霸，得不如己者亡」。此正是說明：治國家者必須識拔眞才，信任眞才，而不可以招攬奴才，驅使奴才爲快事。</p>
<p>以上所舉，卑之無甚高論，也只因爲孫院長臨危受命，舉措有關國脈，故貢其一得之愚，切望孫內閣成爲中國政治新生之契機</p>

<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕國防部政工局頃發表十一月二日至八日一週戰局如下：</p>
<p>（一）華東戰塲</p>
<p>國軍爲打擊麕集在宿縣週邊的陳劉各匪主力，於三日主動撤離徐州，分兵三路向匪後側進　，東路　曹村·夾溝，對盤踞鐵路沿綫之匪加重壓力，中路在蕭縣與濉溪口間展開掃蕩，西路前向永城方向進擊，以截擊匪軍逃向黃泛之歸路。</p>
<p>陳匪主力原係集中南向宿縣固鎭，以圖隔離我徐蚌地區的聯絡和威脅蚌埠，但因我徐州之國軍向西南挺進，遮斷陳劉兩匪主力的後方聯絡綫，再加我黃維兵團又從澮河右岸地區向宿縣壓迫，形將打斷匪在宿縣的聯絡據點，陳匪驚惶失措之餘，下令一天一百華里的速度後退，但我蚌埠正面大軍奮勇追擊，澮河西岸的黃維兵團又從側面打出，匪不敢以全力北退，於是被我吸住在澮河以南的匪，只好深溝高壘，與我相持於雙堆集·前後周村·李莊·沈莊·張家莊等地區。劉匪除以第二縱隊及陳匪第六縱隊節節抵抗我之追擊，掩護陳毅匪部全力北撤，以阻擊我南下大軍，减除在永城方面之危機外，並糾集土共，在蘇北姜堰·盱眙一帶蠢動，意圖牽制。目前集結在我邱·李·孫各兵團當面的陳匪，爲一·三·四·七·新八·第九·十·十一·十三·快速·兩廣·魯中南各縱隊，已達十三個單位，總兵力不到廿萬，正與我相持中。</p>
<p>在宿縣西南雙堆集附近地區與匪激戰之我黃維兵團，十餘日來，以優勢砲火，先後斃傷匪已逾二萬五千，其中以劉匪第一第九縱隊及陳匪第十二縱隊受創最重，檢查匪屍，匪第九縱隊廿六旅旅長壽文高等均已被我擊斃。本月六日在沈莊周莊等地的攻擊，又將增援劉匪的陳毅匪部第七縱隊之第二十師完全擊潰，斃匪達二千餘，幷鹵獲輕重機槍卅餘挺，步槍四百餘支，及其他軍用品甚多，該方面之匪現正堅築工事固守，已有三個縱隊的匪調援東面及北面。至於在淝河流域以南之陳毅匪第六縱隊大部，已被我擊潰成零股，雖劉匪調軍增援，無法補救，刻我仍在繼續掃蕩中。</p>
<p>我由蚌埠北上大軍，正排除當面匪之阻撓，節節推進，戰事刻正在新橋，曹老集以北西北及何集包家集（均新橋站西）一帶進行戰鬥中。</p>
<p>（二）華北戰塲</p>
<p>華北方面的奸匪新近又在陰謀蠢動，自從關外增援的零匪已有八個縱險的番號入關，聶匪榮臻爲牽制我兵力，掩護林彪匪的安全集中起見，特率其第一，第二，第六三個縱隊，及李運昌匪部第八縱隊，與匪軍區部隊詹大南部新七新八兩獨立師，共約四萬餘匪衆，企圖偷襲我張垣，截斷平綏東段之交通，國軍在事前已洞燭其奸，當卽配合人民武力，在柴溝堡及張垣西南之太平寨，大師莊等地，予匪以痛擊，激戰自二日晚開始，持續至五日，國軍以士氣旺盛，戰略遝用得宜，獲得大捷，匪全部傷亡在七萬以上，我先後共俘獲匪軍二千一百七午餘名，步槍五百餘枝，機槍廿餘挺，幷鹵獲戰馬七百餘匹，及其他輜重文件甚多。刻林彪匪部雖有一部到達冀東及長城附近各口，但以聶匪新遇慘敗，又懾於我軍民團結，實力堅强，也不敢輕率妄動，國軍正在平津市南北東西地區搜捕殘匪，嚴陣以待。由於我軍在張垣外圍的勝利，故近來華北局勢更穩定。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎八日電〕聯大政委會不顧蘇聯集團之反對，今晚以四十一對六票，又兩票棄權，通過中美澳三國聯合提案，承認南韓政府爲朝鮮境內唯一合法政府，並規定設立新朝鮮委員會，團員人選由原任中·美·英·法·加·澳·菲·印及烏克蘭等九國蟬聯。該委會有權通行朝鮮全境，並監督美蘇佔領軍於「可實行之儘早期內」撤退。該提案卽將提交大會批准。卽使在烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基提出渠不願就職之警告後，烏克蘭仍被選爲該委會之一員。政委會於通過此議之後，復以四十對六票又三票棄權，否決蘇聯所提撤消舊朝鮮委會之敵對性建議，蘇聯之建議除撤消舊朝鮮委會外，並斥該委會分裂朝鮮及贊成「在警察壓迫與壓制情形下」所舉行之南韓選舉。本日兩項決議已完成政委會在此屆聯大會議中之工作，當政委會開始下午會議以聽取捷克·白俄羅斯及南斯拉夫譴責美國在朝鮮之行動時，出席者不及十二國。在美國領導下之大多數國家讓蘇集團譴責而不加答覆，俾可從速表決。美代表杜爾斯於上午會議中，當蘇聯代表馬立克斥其爲說謊者之時，座次與馬氏相隔僅數碼。杜氏聞及馬列克之控斥時卽取下聽筒，在馬氏演說之其餘時間內始終怒目注視馬氏。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城九日電〕聯合國承認南韓共和國消息傳來，此問大爲歡騰，全國已定期舉行游行與慶祝。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城九日電〕南韓總統李承晚今日宣稱，聯合國承認南韓政府爲朝鮮全國政府，將對南北韓人民發生一項精神上之重大影響。南韓外畏張澤相表示聯合國朝鮮委員會應知朝鮮現仍有南北分裂之鐵幕存在，職是之故，南韓必須積極進行目衛，準備受美軍之保護，以及獲得聯合國精神上之支持。某軍事發言人稱，最近南韓希望訓練十萬軍隊至明夏完成，目前之五萬人，在共黨一旦自北方侵入時，認爲仍不足以防禦。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎九日電〕西方國家九日忍痛將其巴勒斯坦調停計劃割去重要部份，竭力使該計劃能在聯大於星期六閉幕前，加以通過。官方透露，西方小國在加拿大及澳洲領導下，已草就廣泛之補充案多項，以修正英美計劃。英美兩國自知原案決無通過大會之可能，故悉兩國已事先同意修改。大會將於九日晚或十日展開最後辯論。大會現有兩途可循：一爲核准大事削减後之英美提案；另一厥爲袖手旁觀，聽任巴勒斯坦處戰火中而不之援。英美兩國此次所以願修改原案，無非在於促令阿拉伯方面不反對調停計劃，而使親阿國家地位减弱。蓋阿拉伯集團曾揚言如安理會通過以色列之加入，彼等將奮鬥到底，決不擁護修正後之調解計劃。有人擬提議暫緩將以色列入會事付表決，法國及加拿大亦不甚願意投票准以色列參加，此在安理會表決時實有舉足輕重之勢。西方代表仍在商討如何並在何地修改英美計劃，然據悉，現在考慮中之修正，包括下列數項：（一）提案絕對不提去年之聯合國分治計劃，及其後修正分治計劃之貝那多特計劃。（二）提案內一切「以色列國家」之字樣，悉予取消。（三）原案中有一項規定五强有權選任三國組織調停委會，現決取消而由聯大自行推選此三國委會。</p>

<p>社委會否決硃集團動議</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕蘇聯集團今日在聯大社會委員會中要求聯大暫緩討論人權宣言，據稱，此種宣言不能滿意，妨害主權且不能譴責法西斯主義。蘇聯集團之動議當被以廿六票對六票否決。人權宣言仍將提出聯大討論。</p>
<h3 id="c41">葡義等入會申請　安理會將重考慮 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎八日電〕聯大會八日晚克服蘇聯之反對，通過漠洲之建議，請安理會重新考慮葡義奧芬外約但，愛爾蘭及錫蘭等七國之入會申請。蘇聯所以否決七國先前之入會申請，因安理會不贊成外蒙·羅·保·阿爾巴尼亞及蘇聯其他衛星國入會。但關於錫蘭申請入會之否決，係基於技術上理由。據目前跡象，在重新考慮入會申請時，錫蘭可能被通過入會。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎八日電〕安理會特別委員會八日限巴勒斯坦阿猶雙方於四十八小時內遵令之撤離尼基夫區及進行休戰全面談判。該委會稱，除非採取適當步驟以遵守上述命令，安理會本身將召集緊急會議，可能在十一日。在該委會採取此項行動前，英國曾警吿稱，猶軍如對外約但發動任何大規模之侵略，英國或將被迫對以色列採取行動」。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京九日電〕日首相吉田茂，現亦涉嫌一賄賂案，此案株連之廣與最近促成蘆田被捕之昭和電工會社案不相上下。據傳此一賄賂案，牽涉甚多，議會議員及政界人士聞彼等曾收受各煤礦經營者之賄賂，而從中阻撓煤礦國營法案之通過，由於政府進行全面整肅衆議院運動而感神經緊張之日本政治人物，現已被稱爲「惶恐集團」，此一集團之龐大出乎一般人意料之外。衆院副議長田中萬逸，有被捕可能，因其亦與煤礦法案賄賂案有關也。傳說吉田茂之婿麻生太賀吉（九州煤礦公人），曾由乃岳經手，將鉅款交予田中及任吉田民主自由黨顧問之前首相幣原喜重郞，以阻撓煤礦國營法案之通過。此外犬養健亦涉有嫌疑，渠原爲蘆田被捕後最有希望之民主黨總裁候裁候選人。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕代理國務鄉羅維特八日在記者招待會中否認由於荷蘭外長史蒂哥已自爪哇返回海牙，而引起目前荷印談判印尼問題已吿「決裂」之猜測。渠稱，此間荷蘭大使館曾通知國務院謂，史氏及其僚屬決定彼等應返荷蘭討論，因彼等之工作係根據政府之訓令。按史氏在二週前赴爪哇視察該處情形。</p>
<p>〔合衆社雪梨九日電〕參加聯合國亞洲及遠東經濟委員會之雪梨郵報外交分析家鮑格斯九日稱：「蘇聯代表團對印尼核准入會，頗感愉快」。渠並稱：「在荷蘭退出本屆會議後，吾人必可聆悉更多之消息」。</p>

<p>（管理）　陳永昌　翟鴻友</p>
<p>靑白隊自勝利後崛起滬上，包辦三屆市長盃，上屆與東華並列聯賽甲組首席，叱咤風雲，不可一世，而本屆在聯賽甲組中，亦保持不敗，奪標呼聲最高。今日精銳齊出，老將新進，聚集一塲，世運代表嚴士鑫坐鎭後方，而以姜　淸或張遠智右輔，黃仕傑把守最後一關。中衛綫上孟義良有萬夫不當之勇，前鋒乃目下各路勁旅中最完整之鋒綫，阿福中鋒極具威脅力，左路羅壽福金祿生，右路費春華與顧以撒，搭配有路，犀利無比。復據最後消息，國脚高保正及高秀淸，屆時重返母隊効勞，則戰鬥力益見充沛</p>
<p>東星乃東北風之代身，該隊曾以三比一力退東華，而遠征在滬時，三和一勝，戰績更見彪炳，鄭秉彝之後衛，王寳山之中堅，均屬大刀闊斧，不可多得，前鋒陳勤短小精悍，姜琨八面玲瓏，加以張吉良掛印中帥，統領三軍，攻門機會不多。北將鐔福楨及全國第一右後衛吳祺祥，拔刀相助，發揮鐵閘雄威，頓使守勢加强，將令對手有難越雷池之感。總之，此幕戰事，全滬第一流大將，幾一網打盡，屆時各顯神通精彩刺激之鏡頭，必層出不窮。</p>

<p>人絲昨日市勢軟中帶盤，市上交易稀少，吐納兩淸。散戶多爲套利交易，絲織業納胃慘淡，人心未見好轉。120號有光天橋晨開九五〇〇元賣出，中間交易淸淡，市况沉悶，喊價微挫二三百元，徘徊於九二〇〇元，迄午收仍未好轉，後因杭帮略有抵補，市况略好。東洋金三馬等開盤時亦頗軟弱，走勢相同，瀕午盤後轉堅，喊價回升，全盤交易不多，價格距離幅度亦微。</p>
<p>生絲外銷價無甚榮辱，洋商納實轉淡，人心未趨樂觀，昨日成交亦稀。內銷價因連日納胃未暢，昨日交易稍趨活躍，人心略穩，走勢微升。D級78勻度做開為一三〇〇〇元，升五百元，生絲優級零抵普通零担輯里干經等各檔均跟升三五百元。</p>
<p>綢緞昨日散多吐售轉旺，業外紗布回小，人心虛怯，市况開盤卽軟，一路步降。被面初開七九〇〇元，八〇〇〇元，竟乏受主，嗣卽徘徊於七四—七五〇〇元間，最後客帮傾吐，散空頻壓，市塲一片了結聲，喊價續小二三百元。迄至收市交易已成尾聲，市價不了而了，華强以七三〇〇元終結，美亞七四〇〇元斬結，大偉呢挫至三五元，其餘無甚交易。</p>

<p>桐油昨市，急遽進展，足度白油每担躍登六四〇元，正牌西洪亦達五八〇元，餘均一致趨俏。揆因目前受時局動盪關係，各貨到源步遜，而出口行家以日來外匯移轉證猛晋，又因有利輸出消息頻傳，故活動之意，漸吿復燃，是以過程頗有賣買失調之象。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕近因時局關係，出口業亦無起色，外匯移轉證行市雖趨上漲，但出口仍少增加希望　以本市而論，規模較大之出口商行，大多已停止經營。</p>
<p>出口物資因需要减少，行市穩定，與外匯移轉證之市價不成比例。後者自發行以來，行市已上升八成至九成，但出口物資之價格仍維持原狀，桐油腸衣反見下落。而外國進口商亦因我國局勢關係，拒受期貨，故出口業在國外，亦乏開展。</p>

<h3 id="c117">布雷先生之聲欬 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 希遐</p>
<p>總統府國策顧問陳布雷先生，以憂勤國事，終且身殉，海內士人，凡嘗讀其文知其名者，無論識與不識，咸爲痛悼。先生一身謹飭，思慮完密，今讀其易　遺書，部署從容，方寸不亂，雖極瑣細事，亦不欲貽身後之累，用可想見其守身之淸與介，赴死之義與烈。昔歐陽永叔嘗曰：「自古有死，皆歸無物，惟聖與賢，雖埋不沒」。今先生之死，其精神殆亦永久不泯乎？會當先生在杭舉行葬禮之日，爰就平居親承聲欬時之見聞所憶，走筆紀之，緬懷榘範，遽隔人天，黯然以思，唏噓何及！</p>
<p>起草名交　露頭角</p>
<p>民國十七年二月中國國民黨第二屆中央執行委員第四次全體會議召開於南京，其時淸黨逾半年以上，北伐之師已底定河朔，寗漢合作，氣象一新，其有名之閉會宣言，卽出陳先生之手。文長凡四千餘言，於黨綱黨義對內對外等政策，作通盤之檢討，而剖析詐明，爲北伐以後團結同志之輝煌文字。大會中原推于右任·戴季陶·丁鼎丞三氏起草，適陳氏以時事新報總主筆之身游京，戴氏因係天釋報同事，遂邀之同赴湯山陶廬休沐，並商榷屬草。越宿脫稿，戴卽急携入城，向于氏交卷。于閱後，連述稱善，一字未予增損，遂在閉慕儀式中朗誦一過，全塲爲之歎服。事後，于髯戲謂戴陳曰：「余對是文有十二字評」。…戴陳亟問。于曰：「不新不舊，半新半奮，又新又舊耳」。言次，相與撫掌大笑。此爲陳先生撰著黨內重要文字之始，亦爲其在黨內擅文名之始。自此以後，每一全會宣言，遂莫不交推陳氏起草矣。</p>
<p>自吁弱者　性溫厚</p>
<p>陳氏身材短小，體素荏弱，生性溫厚，罕與人爭，或遇拂逆之事，退輒自吁爲「弱者」，爲「書生」，爲「無用」。其六公子中，以五子遂爲最瘦小而孱弱，小學時代多病，且每爲同學欺凌，氏嘗撫摩其頂而慰之曰：「汝亦弱者，竟似乃父耶？可憐兒！」言下含無限疼愛。</p>
<p>彎彎扁担　挑不斷</p>
<p>陳氏體弱多病，初僅患輕微失眠症，後因長期操勞，缺乏休息與調節，自民國二十年以後，已至非服安眠藥不能入睡之程度；幸其夫人王允默女士加意護持，仍得帶病延年，以公職終其身，去花甲僅缺一歲耳。猶憶民國二十七年五六月，氏居武昌胭脂屛侍從室，日敵飛機猛炸徐家棚車站及珞珈山機塲，胡林翼道等處，每感受震撼。余往晋謁，問受虛驚否？先生曰：「敵賤轟炸南京之初，精神上確曾感到威脅，但今則已司空見慣，轉不以爲意矣。」又曰：「余今年四十有九，實已過余父之壽，縱死亦無憾矣。」余曰：「余鄕有俚諺，彎彎扁擔挑不斷，先生其近之，」氏爲之莞爾。</p>
<p>家學佳話　陳張程</p>
<p>新聞界能文之士綦多，就其得力於兄長者言：陳布雷氏頗似張東蓀。蓋張氏之兄孟劬，爲吳中宿學，戴季陶氏且嘗從之遊；而陳氏之兄爲嬰寧老人陳屺懷，卽曩年天鐸報之總主筆也。就其得力於外舅者言：陳氏又似程滄波，程氏之岳丈錢名山（振鍠），爲武進名士；而陳氏之岳丈楊遜齋（敏曾），亦爲浙東文豪。陳·張·程·三氏之國學根柢，其淵源如此，亦佳話也。</p>
<p>心寒腹痛　談陝變</p>
<p>當二十五年十二月十二日西安事變起，陳氏爲中政會副秘書長交代事，先三日由洛到京，遂未隨委員長西去，但商議討伐籌劃營救諸事，異常緊張，恒累夕不寢，故辛勞特甚。余於十四日見招入京，助理日常函牘雜務。至十二月二十五日，委員長出險還京，二十八日張漢卿受審，委員長至頤和路廿三號陳寓小休半日，及卅一日邵元冲靈柩過江，侍從人員均歸來，余遂於元旦返滬。臨行時，先生對余曰：「古人嘗有「寒心」及「腹痛」二詞語，往者雖知其義，但非臨實境，終於體驗不到，今經西安事件之役以後，方恍悟古人用字之眞且切矣。」言時，以手捫心及腹曰：「所謂寒心，此方寸地眞有寒意；所謂腹痛，腹腔全部爲之痙攣，眞有此境，絕非虛語也。」余唯唯而退，知先生之病深矣。幸袪盡利慾，事事達觀，故又能延壽一紀，否則早辭　世矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Battle of Bengbu-Suxian Enters a New Phase: Two Major Victories for the Southern Expeditionary Force; 20,000+ Communists Eliminated Northeast of Yongcheng <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] Today, the Pacification Headquarters here issued its first major victory announcement on the day following the arrival of the Beijing-Shanghai慰勞團 (consolation group) in Bengbu, stating: This morning, the Southern Expeditionary Force routed Chen's 3rd Column in the Lulou area, northeast of Yongcheng. In the areas of Haozhai, Gelou, and Taoge, the bandits were also dealt blows. In both battlefields, the bandits suffered casualties of over 20,000. Also, when Fang Zhi慰勞 (comforted) the Air Force today, a responsible person from the local Air Force stated that there were no special changes in the overall battlefield situation.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] The battle situation around Bengbu-Suxian seems to be gradually entering a new phase. The northward-bound Li Corps has been launching pincer attacks for days, severely striking Chen's 6th Column and Liu's 2nd Column facing them. Today, the right pincer captured the Huoshenmiao stronghold. The Heji force is also pursuing westward, while the left pincer is confronting the bandits in a position at Gucheng and Shizhuang (both located 35 li northwest of Huaiyuan). Due to the northward advance of the Li Corps, the pressure on the southeastern side of the Huang Corps' position has been greatly reduced. In recent days, this corps has been gradually closing in on the Li Corps through attacks. According to news tonight, this unit, after defeating the resistance of two bandit regiments facing them today, captured a dozen or so villages, and its position has expanded to the south bank of the Chan River. The distance between the two pincers of the Li Corps is only a day's march (about 61 li). General observation suggests that with the full-scale attack of the two corps, the meeting of the Huang and Li forces is only a matter of time. The focus of future battles may shift to the Southern Expeditionary Force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] General Du Yuming, commanding the large Southern Expeditionary Force, routed three Communist columns in the Lulou area, northeast of Yongcheng, on the morning of the 9th. The bandits suffered over 10,000 casualties, with more than 8,000 bodies abandoned in front of the National Army's positions. Simultaneously, in the Haozhai, Gelou, and Taoge areas north of Lulou, over 10,000 bandits were also eliminated. In total, these two areas saw over 20,000 bandits killed or wounded. The remaining bandits, having suffered this heavy blow, are in a state of collapse across the entire front. This glorious victory was announced by Commander-in-Chief Liu of the Pacification Headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 9th, after accepting banners and gift lists presented by the three consolation groups from Beijing and Shanghai. Commander-in-Chief Liu also expressed his hope that the consolation groups and accompanying members of the press would convey the determination of the troops under his command to secure the Jianghuai region and reverse the overall situation to compatriots in the rear.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] It has been confirmed that the Zhang Gan Corps, moving north from southern Henan, has reached Fuyang, and the county seat has been recovered. The vanguard of Zhang's force has reached Mengcheng and will join forces with the large northern and southern corps at Suxian to sandwich the bandit army. Also, a portion of the Huang Wei Corps, which has been fighting bitterly near Shuangduiji for over ten days, has now moved to a favorable area and is gradually gaining an advantage. It is likely to join forces with the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] Our armored vehicle unit of the Huang Corps, coordinating its advance southeast, captured the bandit strongholds of Yangzhuang and Lizhuang on the 9th, killing over 1,000 bandits.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] News from the National Army side today: The Communist army in the East China region is currently adopting "wheel tactics" due to a shortage of ammunition. Chen Yi's troops are currently retreating, with Liu Bocheng's forces moving forward to fight. When Liu's forces run out of ammunition, they will retreat for resupply, and then Chen's forces will move forward to fight.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] Military News: (1) Over 1,000 local bandits from Sun Zhuanjia's unit sneaked into Zhulongqiao, 35 li northwest of Chuxian, on the afternoon of the 7th. The railroad protection unit has increased its vigilance. There was minor damage to the railway last night, and the Railway Bureau has dispatched an engineering team to repair it. (2) Over 3,000 bandits from Chen Qingxian's unit of the Jianghuai Independent Brigade, who sneaked into Heqiao Bridge southwest of Xuyi, have fled into the nearby mountains after being attacked by a certain unit of the National Army. It is also reported that a group of bandits has sneaked into the vicinity of Jiuwanji, east of Xinqiao Station.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] A portion of the bandits in the Hongze Lake area attempted to cross the Huai River by stealth near Xuyi. The defending troops are currently blocking and attacking them.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Office, 9th Dispatch] In order to concentrate its forces for deployment and suppression, the National Army has recently shortened the defenses along the Grand Canal line. It is reported that both Huai'an and Huaibei have been proactively evacuated, and a strong defensive position has been set up north of Baoying to await an opportunity to eliminate the bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Office, 9th Dispatch] On the evening of the 9th, three companies of bandit troops gathered at Sidunzi across the river. They were dispersed after being shelled by our artillery on the south bank.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Liu Zhi Speaks at Length on the Bengbu-Suxian Campaign: National Army Achieves Preliminary Victory; The Rear Should Eradicate the Psychology of Defeat <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi spoke at length to Beijing-Shanghai reporters visiting Bengbu on the 9th, regarding the current battle situation, stating that the National Army has achieved a preliminary victory in the Suxian-Bengbu campaign. He called on people in the rear to eradicate the psychology of defeat. Liu Zhi said: In the Xuzhou campaign, because the officers and soldiers of the National Army fought bravely, Chen Yi's bandit forces suffered 200,000 casualties and retreated in the face of difficulty, so Xuzhou was unharmed. In Xuzhou, I said that this campaign was not over, because the two bandit forces of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng had transferred from the Central China theater to the border area of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui. During the Xuzhou campaign, they took the opportunity to sneak south to Suxian, cut off our Xuzhou-Bengbu transportation, and attempted to invade the Huai River. After the Xuzhou campaign came to an end, most of Chen Yi's remaining forces also sneaked south to the area east of Suxian. In order to concentrate its forces and eliminate the main force of the bandits, the National Army abandoned Xuzhou and fought the bandits with all its strength. This is what people generally call the "Suxian-Bengbu Campaign." Liu Zhi continued: The Suxian-Bengbu campaign is currently in full swing. Although the preliminary victory already belongs to the National Army, it has not yet reached a decisive stage. If we can achieve the expected results in the future, not only can the Jianghuai region be secured, but there will be no major problems south of the Yellow River. If we draw, we can also hold the Huai River. Of course, we hope that the officers and soldiers of the National Army on both the northern and southern fronts can make their greatest efforts and bravely charge forward to achieve the greatest possible victory. As for whether some people worry about the outcome of this campaign, what will happen if the National Army fails? Regarding this point, I have never thought about it, because I am very clear about the strength of the bandits facing us, and I am even clearer about the strength of the National Army. I firmly believe that the National Army under my command will not be so weak and incompetent. Gentlemen, some of you have seen them fight on the Xuzhou front, so you know that what I say is based on fact. Therefore, I ask you gentlemen to work together to eliminate this pessimistic defeatism. (News of the慰勞團 (consolation group)慰勞ing (comforting) the troops in Bengbu and the "Weekly War Situation" released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense are both published on page 2)</p>
<h3 id="e3">United Press Reporter: What I Saw at the Front Lines <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Reporter, Cao Lao Ji Front Line, 9th Dispatch] On the 8th, I traveled by military vehicle from Bengbu to Cao Lao Ji, where I met with Liang Tongxin (transliteration), Chief of Staff of the 6th Corps. According to General Liang, 30,000 Communist troops have gathered on the line from Zhang Baying to Heji, eight miles northwest of here. Cao Lao Ji is currently the location of the headquarters of the 6th Army Group. After talking with General Liang for a short time, I followed the army to the front lines. Nine out of ten villages passed along the way were empty, with broken walls and remaining fires, the traces of war clearly visible. When we arrived at the headquarters of Hu Changqing's army, four miles from the front lines, the fighting was intense. Wounded soldiers were being evacuated from the front lines in batches. The National Army's clothing and food were very good, and the equipment was complete, with American-style carbines and 105mm mortars. I also met Communist prisoners, whose clothing and rations were also quite good. They said: "Chen Yi gave us a speech a month ago, saying that we could enter Nanjing within three months. We have three meals a day during combat, but there is too much marching. We travel long distances at night and rest temporarily in the fields and trenches during the day."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Military Situation in Eastern Hebei Accelerates: Major Battle to Unfold in the Tianjin-Beijing-Tangshan Triangle; Communist Forces Around Zhangjiakou Have Become a Spent Force <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Tangshan Office, 9th Dispatch] The military situation in eastern Hebei is gradually tightening. According to official information here, a portion of the bandit forces around Tangshan are moving westward. Lin's 3rd Column is gathering in Zunhua. Parts of the 9th and 11th Columns, with a force of 30,000, are entrenched in Yutian. Part of the 7th and 9th Columns is still stationed northwest of Fengrun. A large number of vehicles are transporting supplies to the Yutian and Jixian areas daily. Looking at the current situation in eastern Hebei, the prelude to the Battle of eastern Hebei has already begun due to the harassing activities of the bandit forces along the Ping绥 (Suiyuan) (Beijing-Suiyuan), Ping保 (Baoding) (Beijing-Baoding), and Ping古 (Gubeikou) (Beijing-Gubeikou) lines. It is judged that the decisive major battle being brewed may unfold in the Sanhe, Jixian, and Baodi areas of the Tianjin-Beijing-Tangshan triangle.</p>
<p>[Our Tangshan Office, 9th Dispatch] The National Army's mopping-up operations in the west have been successful. Parts of the 8th and 10th Regiments of the local Communist police force near Beijadian Station on the Beijing-Northeast (Liaoning) line were completely routed yesterday. The National Army also captured the village of Qibaihu southeast of Beijadian and is continuing to mop up the remaining bandits in the Leizhuang and Linxi areas. According to local reports, the vanguard of Lin's subsequent units entering the Guan (Shan-hai-guan Pass) has reached Luanxian city yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Tangshan Office, 9th Dispatch] Several sections of the railway tracks at kilometer 288 of the Tangshan-Guye section of the Beijing-Northeast (Liaoning) line were destroyed by bandit landmines last night. Also, the railway between Guye and Beijadian was also damaged by bandits in many places. Nine officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps were injured by the explosions. The Railway Bureau has begun repairs today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th Dispatch] The communist bandits around Zhangjiakou are at their wit's end. The National Army is preparing to launch an offensive to mop up the invading bandits. They suffered heavy blows in Chenjiatun, Yulinbao, and west of Wanquan, southeast of Zhangjiakou. On the 9th, the remaining bandits broke up into smaller groups to harass the area. The National Army is deploying new forces to eliminate the remaining bandits. Also, over 1,000 bandits who snuck in on the 8th were completely annihilated near Nantianmen, north of Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th Dispatch] The fighting in the eastern section of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway is currently intense between Kangzhuang and Xinbao'an. The National Army's morale is high, and the terrain is favorable. The bandits are being cut off section by section, and layers of attacks are being launched. The Air Force is also flying in to provide assistance. It is reported that approximately 600 bandits have been killed or wounded, and over 30 bandit fortifications have been destroyed. Also, south of Zhangjiakou, the National Army has advanced to the area on both banks of the Yang River to fight the bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 9th Dispatch] According to sources, in order to concentrate its forces and use them flexibly, the National Army on the Beijing-Baoding line has completed the evacuation of Xincheng and is engaging in guerrilla warfare with the remaining bandits on the periphery. Gu'an is still being firmly defended by the National Army. Wang Fenggang's forces are carrying out guerrilla operations in the Liulihe area. Wang himself will return to his defense position this afternoon after coming to Beiping to meet with the authorities.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 9th Broadcast: Washington News: President Truman told reporters that he will discuss China's request for increased U.S. aid with Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek at the tea party he will host for her on Friday. He expects Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek to make three requests: (1) U.S. aid to China of $1 billion per year for three years, with this aid being primarily military in nature; (2) the dispatch of a more powerful advisory group to China by the U.S., and the dispatch of a highly respected general to China to assist the government in fighting the communists; (3) the reaffirmation of the unity of China and the U.S. Asked if the President will continue consultations with Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek after this tea party, the President said that no decision has been made yet. Asked if the President could urge Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek to hold a press conference, Truman said that it would be best for reporters to directly request this from Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek. Another reporter said that when Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek came to the U.S. last time, she jointly hosted a press conference with President Roosevelt. Truman said that he was not present at that time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Lovett again avoided answering questions from reporters on the 8th regarding the activities of Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek. Lovett said that he was not aware of Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek's trip plans and did not know the content of Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek's two meetings with Marshall.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th Dispatch] Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek gracefully attended the Christmas bazaar hosted by the Washington Committee of the United China Relief today, expressing her gratitude to Chinese friends for their wartime and current aid to our country. Ambassador Gu Weijun and his wife opened the bazaar. Hundreds of prominent women from Washington's social circles participated, and they warmly welcomed Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek with an enthusiastic response. Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek said in her speech: "I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the friends who have been thinking about China for many years. Your benevolent acts have deeply touched the hearts of our Chinese people. They are extremely grateful for your long-lasting assistance. This bazaar is especially memorable to us. You have a deep love for the welfare of the Chinese people, so you have held this grand event. And you also have a true knowledge and concern for those who are threatened in the struggle around the world." At today's bazaar, Mrs. Brooks, Chairwoman of the Washington Committee of the United China Relief, welcomed Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek in her speech and wished her great success on this trip. Mrs. Brooks also said on behalf of American friends of China: We guarantee to move forward bravely and continue to aid China as much as possible. This afternoon, Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek specially presented a blue brocade curtain to the committee. President Truman's wife also visited the bazaar in the afternoon and purchased several items. It is expected that the income from this year's bazaar will be even greater than last year, and the funds will be distributed by American churches to the various hospitals, clinics, orphanages, and cooperatives supported by American friends within the week.</p>

<p>[Our Tongxian Office, 9th Dispatch] Tongxian is expanding its city defenses, and construction is currently underway actively. In addition to the National Army voluntarily rushing to build them, civilians are also participating in the labor. After deliberation by the City Defense Department, the southeast gates have been blocked, and houses within 30 zhang outside the city wall must be demolished to facilitate firing range. According to the person in charge of the City Defense Department, it is estimated that about 2,000 rooms will be demolished. The government will allocate 50 catties of corn per room as a subsidy. Regarding the housing problem for the demolished residents: (1) Public houses will be used to accommodate them as much as possible; (2) Public land is allowed to be used to build houses at will. Also, the historically renowned潞河 (Luhe) Middle School and潞河 (Luhe) Hospital are also on the list of buildings to be demolished.

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] Sun Ke's cabinet formation is currently underway in Shanghai. His proposed cabinet of giants has repeatedly consulted Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and others, but no satisfactory result has been achieved. It is heard that Zhang Qun firmly declined the position of Vice President of the Executive Yuan, but expressed that if Weng, Zhang, and others join the cabinet, he would be willing to assist. He also believes that the future cabinet must be one with proposals and plans, otherwise he would not join the cabinet. Weng Wenhao said that he could assist in government affairs in the name of a 政委 (Political Committee Member). The results of Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Shanghai on the 8th for talks are still unknown. And because Wu Tiecheng and Chen Lifu are restricted by the law that members of the Legislative Yuan cannot concurrently hold official positions, they are also unable to join the cabinet. Therefore, Sun's cabinet of giants seems likely to encounter difficulties. However, it is rumored here that Sun will assume office on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] President Sun's condition is improving day by day. Yesterday, he was able to walk indoors without assistance. Liu Weichi visited him, but the content of their conversation is unknown. According to doctors, President Sun can be discharged within a day or two. Also, government officials Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, and others have been in Shanghai for several days and have been in contact with President Sun. The lineup of the new cabinet can be decided within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local News] President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke, believing that the establishment of the new cabinet cannot be delayed any longer, has scheduled to be discharged from the hospital tomorrow (the 11th) and return to his residence. He may return to Nanjing on Sunday.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Legislative Yuan to Hold Closed-Door Meeting Today: Discussion of Foreign Affairs Cases; Postal Rate Increase Case to be Referred for Review <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] The 27th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 10th. A closed-door meeting will be held first to discuss cases related to foreign affairs, including cases submitted by Qi Zhihou and others and Liu Zhaoxun and others, accusing the Soviet Union of violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to the United Nations. Then, an open meeting will be held. Among the reported items on the agenda are the Executive Yuan's proposal regarding the Temporary Property Tax Statute, which has been submitted to the President for approval and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, and the Executive Yuan's request for review of the proposed adjustment of domestic postal rates.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] Postal rates are about to increase again. The Ministry of Transportation's proposed adjustment of domestic postal rates, after being passed by the Executive Yuan Council, was immediately referred to the Legislative Yuan for review. It has been included in the reported items on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan's meeting on the 10th and will be referred for review after the report. The standard for this domestic postal rate adjustment is based on the recent supplementary measures announced by the government to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan. The value of the Gold Yuan has depreciated to one-fifth of its original value, so the proposed postal rates are five-fourths of the original price, that is, the new postal rates after the adjustment will be 5 jiao for ordinary mail, 2 yuan for registered mail, and 2.5 yuan for express mail.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Temporary Property Tax Statute: Ministry of Finance Believes it is Difficult to Implement; Legislative Yuan Responds that it will be Referred to the Financial and Economic Committee for Review <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] Regarding the Temporary Property Tax Statute, which the Legislative Yuan revised and passed after half a year of review and compromise based on a proposal by Liu Butong, the Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministry of Finance to discuss and respond, believing that it is difficult to implement. It has been submitted to the President for approval and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration a few days ago. This dispatch has been included in the report to be presented at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 10th. The opinions of the Program Committee are to refer it to the Financial and Economic Committee for review. The reasons for the Ministry of Finance's response cited in the dispatch are as follows: "The implementation of the Temporary Property Tax will help balance current revenue and expenditure and enrich the military expenses for suppressing the rebellion. It is a good strategy to increase revenue. From the perspective of social policy, it also has the effect of equalizing the burden and meets the goal of people's livelihood. However, after comprehensively reviewing the full text of the statute, there are still areas for research regarding the issues of taxation objects, property registration, and taxation of foreign property. The following is a brief description of each: (1) Regarding the issue of taxation objects, Article 8 of the original statute stipulates that taxable property includes real estate and personal property. Among them, some have already been heavily taxed and cannot bear further burdens, while others are easy to conceal and difficult to capture and control. For example, land has been relied upon for years for the collection of land tax in kind, military grain, and civilian food. If the collection in kind is insufficient, additional purchases and loans are levied. Its existing burden cannot be said to be light. And urban land is also subject to the collection of land value tax and value-added tax, and the burden is not light either. The property tax rate is particularly high, and whether there is such a large surplus power is questionable. According to current laws and regulations, homeowners have no income, and in addition to housing tax and property rental income tax, there are various local levies. This heavy tax may also be difficult to bear. As for personal property, gold, silver, foreign currency, foreign exchange, and cash, jewelry, etc., are inherently impossible to investigate. Even deposits, securities, claims, investments, etc., are either unregistered or, although registered, are mostly assumed names, which is equivalent to being unregistered. How can they be investigated accurately? There are also considerations in terms of method. As for goods and transportation equipment, it is difficult to distinguish which should be taxed and which should be exempted. The investigation procedure is also extremely complicated. How can we simplify the complicated? It is necessary to carefully consider and make a proper decision. (2) Regarding the issue of property registration, our country has never had a unified property registration system for the people. The registration methods adopted by various agencies to promote certain management業務 (business) needs are also simple and incomplete, and they are abolished as soon as they are implemented. The data is scattered. Articles 14 and 15 of the original statute stipulate that taxpayers shall declare and pay taxes themselves, and the collecting agency shall register their property in conjunction with the original財政 (Finance) registration agency and carry out investigation and valuation procedures. Whether this can achieve practical results is difficult to say for sure. Even if there are regulations for the supervisory agency to nominate a limited time for reporting, since the government has no registration data for verification, it is not easy to order the people to automatically report truthfully, and the nomination seems to be in vain. In short, if the people's property has not been registered first, proceeding directly to tax collection may have the suspicion of wanting to achieve success too quickly and should be reconsidered. (3) Regarding the issue of taxation of foreign property, it is generally believed that the wealth of the rich is mostly far away overseas, so calls for collecting deposits from Chinese people abroad or征購 (purchasing) and 征借 (borrowing) foreign exchange assets have never ceased. However, the government has repeatedly negotiated with Britain and the United States to register the deposits of Chinese people, but there has been no result. It seems even more difficult to proceed to taxation. Articles 1 and 8 of the statute also stipulate the collection of property of Chinese people abroad. How to start the process requires sufficient preparation in the diplomatic field before it can be expected to achieve significant results. As for the property of foreigners in China, the original statute also stipulates that taxes shall be levied together. Whether this will cause other disputes seems worthy of consideration. The above three points are related to the success or failure of the property tax and must be considered first before proceeding. Otherwise, the same old story of special donation for救濟 (relief) will be repeated once, which will not only fail to help finance but also lead to criticism from the public opinion. At that time, the government's difficulties will not be difficult to imagine. This Ministry believes that although holding a property tax is a good strategy to increase revenue, we should strive to overcome the various difficulties. However, at a time when military tensions are high and society is turbulent, whether it is appropriate to levy it immediately seems to be something that should be weighed."</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 9th (Radio Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin, during a foreign affairs debate in the Lower House on the 9th, addressed the China issue, stating: "We have informed China that we are unable to provide any material assistance to China due to our own financial and economic situation." Regarding the Chinese Communist forces, he stated: "Currently, no one can predict where the Communist forces will be stopped, or to what extent their power will expand." Britain's attitude toward China is constrained by the Moscow Declaration of December 1945, in which Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union declared a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Due to the wartime strategies of the Allied nations and the post-war situation, the U.S. government is more concerned about providing assistance to China than Britain. The British Embassy in Nanjing and consulates throughout China remain at their posts, operating as usual. At the same time, British expatriates continue to conduct business as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Editorial: How Will the New Cabinet Be "New"? <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>More than ten days have passed since the Legislative Yuan approved the appointment of Sun Ke as the new President of the Executive Yuan. During this time, President Sun met with reporters and representatives from various sectors of Shanghai, stating that his main goals in forming the cabinet are to unite all forces, widely solicit public opinion, reform past political practices, and rescue the current crisis. People both in China and abroad have placed great hopes on President Sun's candid remarks. Subsequently, President Sun's medical treatment for a leg tumor caused delays in the formation of the new cabinet. However, yesterday, central government officials gathered in Shanghai to discuss the selection of personnel for the new cabinet with President Sun, and it is rumored that a consensus may have been reached. It is also rumored that scholars from the former capital and hermits residing in Hong Kong are being recruited to join the cabinet. It is evident that this new cabinet, which has been "called for a thousand times," will soon be born with President Sun's arrival in Beijing.</p>
<p>China has reached a critical juncture for its survival. Not only are the military victories and defeats in containing the expansion of Communist forces a concern for people both in China and abroad, but also the future of all political and economic measures is attracting widespread attention. Indeed, China's central government has been in a state of near "anarchy" for more than a month, with everyone in disarray, creating a sense of disunity. Fortunately, President Chiang Kai-shek has remained steadfast, maintaining control in the capital, while the soldiers on the Jinpu front have fought valiantly, maintaining high morale, which has stabilized the overall situation. However, in the struggle against the Communist Party, which has international backing, one should not rely solely on the President's steadfastness and the soldiers' sacrifices. Instead, there should be a strong and effective "new" government that recruits "new" talent and demonstrates a "new" style to lead the "new" forces in society and establish "new" hopes for this future government among people both in China and abroad. Only then can we win back the people's hearts and reverse the nation's destiny. Therefore, President Chiang's appointment of Sun's cabinet is with a spirit of "renewal with the people," and President Sun should bravely shoulder the great responsibility of "reforming politics."</p>
<p>But how should this important new cabinet be "new" in order to meet the expectations of the nation?</p>
<p>First, it must be responsible, not just an administrative office. In a democratic country, the cabinet must first determine its own policies and be responsible to the legislative body for implementing those policies, bearing all the consequences of success or failure. Those who take responsibility are politicians; those who merely sit in administrative offices are just bureaucrats! Bureaucrats typically operate with two words in mind: "push" and "delay." When a matter comes to their hands, they either seek instructions or pass it on to be drafted; they either push the responsibility to superiors or delegate it to subordinates. This is the "push" tactic. Secondly, when a matter involves multiple agencies, consultations drag on for a long time, with unclear lines of authority and responsibility, causing delays of months or even years without any results. This is the "delay" tactic. The inefficiency of Chinese politics and the incompetence of Chinese officials have earned them criticism that they cannot defend against, all due to these two words! Therefore, if Sun's cabinet does not wish to reform politics, it can remain as it is. Otherwise, it should first establish a system of responsible cabinet governance, clearly define the authority of each level of responsibility, and prohibit dereliction of duty and overreach of authority. There should be no "pushing" or "delaying" allowed. Only then can the Head of State remain at the top, with capable assistants on either side, and officials at all levels diligently perform their duties without shirking responsibilities, leading to a new look in Chinese politics and inspiring new hope among the people.</p>
<p>Second, it must define policies, not just assemble a hodgepodge. It should be understood that the general expectation of the people is to use new people and implement new policies. Therefore, the prerequisite for using people is their understanding of policies. President Sun, bearing the great responsibility of forming a cabinet, knows that the times are difficult, but duty calls. Before taking office, he must assess the domestic and international situation and determine the new cabinet's major policies, both domestic and foreign. Then, he should select talent, seeking those who agree with these policies to work together, so that they can be as nimble as arms and fingers, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Certainly, unity of the party and unity of the nation are the characteristics that the new cabinet wishes to promote; but it must be noted that this "unity" implies agreement on policies, not simply everyone being included in the cabinet to share the spoils. If the political views of someone are not asked, or the positions on certain issues are not considered, but they are simply included in the cabinet because they belong to a certain party, faction, or group, then if disagreements arise in the future, what can the new cabinet accomplish? Therefore, a "unified" cabinet must have a center, and this center must be determined by policies. Otherwise, it cannot be called unity but can only be named a "hodgepodge." We absolutely do not want China, at this critical moment of survival, to experience another hodgepodge cabinet.</p>
<p>Third, it must select genuine talent, not just add sycophants. In these days of cabinet formation, many people are preparing to criticize others, many are hoping to move up, and many are engaging in lobbying and competition. We, the people, certainly do not want to see some high officials who have been negligent and responsible for misleading the country continue to cling to their positions, nor do we want to see only a few figures constantly appearing in the limelight, as if the world is so big and the people so numerous, only these people are talented. But at the same time, we do not want to see a group of reckless and arrogant bookworms, under the banner of "using new people," filling positions without the necessary qualifications, and especially do not want to see those in high positions only seeking sycophants who are willing to obey and anticipate their wishes, creating a great hidden danger for the country. It must be understood that the current situation in China is like a disease that has penetrated deep into the body. Recovery depends on national experts with profound knowledge and the ability to shoulder great responsibilities. We cannot afford to allow mediocre doctors to conduct experiments again. In particular, we must be vigilant against those who are accustomed to corruption and have tarnished reputations from sneaking in. In extraordinary times, bearing extraordinary responsibilities requires extraordinary talent. And the foundation of extraordinary talent is still built on the four virtues of fairness, integrity, comprehensiveness, and understanding. Only fairness can prevent one from taking risky and opportunistic paths; only understanding can prevent one from becoming stubborn and self-righteous. Fairness, integrity, comprehensiveness, and understanding, combined with a spirit of public loyalty and serving the country, and knowing when to advance and when to retreat, are the genuine talents that the country urgently needs today. The ancients said: "He who gains teachers becomes a king; he who gains friends becomes a hegemon; he who gains those inferior to himself perishes." This precisely explains that those who govern the country must recognize and trust genuine talent, and should not recruit sycophants and use them for their own enjoyment.</p>
<p>The above points are merely humble opinions. It is only because President Sun has taken on his mandate at a time of crisis, and his actions are related to the nation's fate, that I offer my humble thoughts, hoping that Sun's cabinet will become the beginning of a new era in Chinese politics.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th] The Jinghu Comfort Mission spent the entire day on the 9th in Bengbu comforting Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liu Ruming, and all their officers and soldiers, as well as the air force stationed in Bengbu, and the joint action police and military units, conveying the deep respect and gratitude of the people in the rear to all the brave soldiers. They plan to continue comforting troops on the front lines on the 10th. The comfort mission first visited the Suppression Headquarters at 10 a.m., met with Commander-in-Chief Liu and other senior generals, presented the "Defend the Nation, Protect the People" banner and gift list, and then Fang Zhi was publicly elected to represent the entire mission in delivering a speech. Fang stated that the people in the rear are enthusiastically supporting the heroic suppression of bandits by the national army soldiers, and hope that the military and the people will be of one mind, striving to "have bandits without me, have me without bandits." Fang continued that, historically, tyrannical forces from the south, whenever they reached the Huai River, would suffer setbacks or perish. For example, Fu Jian of the Eastern Jin Dynasty suffered defeat in the Battle of Feishui, which is proof of this. The Chen Liu bandit group's invasion of the Huai River this time will inevitably repeat historical precedents. Commander-in-Chief Liu, upon receiving the banner, thanked the comfort mission on behalf of all the officers and soldiers, stating that all the soldiers will work harder to secure the Huai River, reverse the overall situation, and repay the earnest expectations of the Jinghu compatriots. The comfort mission then visited the headquarters of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liu Ruming, presented the "Pillar of the Party and the Nation" banner, and all the members were greatly inspired by the strong fighting will, well-fed horses, and vigorous spirit of Liu's troops.</p>

The funeral committee decided to follow Mrs. Chen's wishes and send Mr. Chen's coffin to Hangzhou, first placing it in the Siming Guild Hall, and burying it after the grave is completed. The following is Mrs. Chen Wang Yunmo's letter to the funeral committee: "To the esteemed members of the funeral committee: My late husband passed away unfortunately, and I, Yunmo, am overwhelmed with grief and confusion. I am grateful for your assistance in handling the funeral arrangements. Your kindness and friendship are deeply appreciated. Thinking of my late husband's lifelong dedication to national affairs, with the nation and the people in mind, and his emphasis on frugality and simplicity in life, I sincerely hope that his funeral arrangements will reflect his wishes and be as simple as possible to comfort his spirit. My late husband loved the beautiful scenery of Hangzhou and purchased a piece of land near Fanzhuang, with the idea of spending his old age there. Therefore, it seems appropriate to choose Hangzhou as his final resting place, and to construct a simple grave for an ordinary citizen on that land, with the inscription 'Grave of Mr. Chen Bulei of Cixi,' without engraving any official titles, to fulfill his lifelong desire for simplicity. If the tomb is not completed in time, the coffin can be temporarily placed in the Siming Guild Hall in Hangzhou, to be buried on a selected date. I have also heard that the state, in recognition of my late husband's hard work for the country, intends to grant him the honor of a national funeral or public funeral. However, my late husband said in his will that as a scholar serving the country, he regrets not having accomplished much, and today the country is in turmoil and the people are displaced. How can he bear to waste the nation's money for his own honor? Therefore, I ask you to kindly explain and decline the proposal for a national funeral or public funeral. In the unlikely event that the state has made a decision that cannot be changed, I hope that the arrangements for the funeral, burial, and tomb construction will be as simple and frugal as possible, and that the surplus funds will be used to relieve the starving people. I hope that you will make separate plans for the specific arrangements. In this way, my late husband's wishes to save the country money and seek happiness for the people will be fulfilled, and you can comfort him in the afterlife. I am weeping as I write this, and I do not know what I am saying. Please understand. Sincerely, Chen Wang Yunmo. November 14."</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch, Changsha, 9th] Hengyang has restored its wartime scene.

<h3 id="e37">The Stalemate in East China and Stability in North China: The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau Releases Weekly Battle Situation <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau has just released the weekly battle situation from November 2nd to 8th as follows:</p>
<p>(1) East China Theater</p>
<p>In order to strike at the main bandit forces of Chen and Liu clustered around Suxian, our forces proactively withdrew from Xuzhou on the 3rd, dividing into three routes to advance towards the bandits' rear. The eastern route, Cao Village and Jiagou, increased pressure on the bandits entrenched along the railway line. The central route launched a mop-up operation between Xiaoxian and Suixikou. The western route advanced towards Yongcheng to intercept the bandit army's retreat towards the Yellow River flood area.</p>
<p>The main force of the Chen bandits was originally concentrated southward towards Suxian and Guzhen, attempting to isolate the connection between our Xuzhou-Bengbu area and threaten Bengbu. However, because our Xuzhou troops advanced southwestward, cutting off the rear communication lines of the Chen and Liu bandits' main forces, and coupled with the fact that our Huang Wei Corps was also pressing towards Suxian from the right bank of the Hui River, threatening to sever the bandits' communication strongholds in Suxian, the Chen bandits, in a state of panic, ordered a retreat at a speed of 100 li per day. However, our main force on the Bengbu front bravely pursued, and the Huang Wei Corps on the west bank of the Hui River also struck from the flank. The bandits dared not retreat northward with all their strength, so the bandits absorbed by us south of the Hui River had no choice but to build deep trenches and high walls, and maintain a stalemate with us in areas such as Shuangduiji, Qianhou Zhoucun, Lizhuang, Shenzhuang, and Zhangjiazhuang. In addition to using the Second Column and the Sixth Column of the Chen bandits to resist our pursuit step by step, covering the full northward retreat of Chen Yi's bandit troops, in order to block our southward advance and reduce the crisis in the Yongcheng area, Liu's bandits also gathered local communists and stirred up trouble in the Jiangyan and Xuyi areas of northern Jiangsu, attempting to contain us. Currently, the Chen bandits gathered facing our Qiu, Li, and Sun Corps are the First, Third, Fourth, Seventh, New Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, Fast, Liangguang, and Luzhongnan Columns, totaling thirteen units, with a total strength of less than 200,000, currently in a stalemate with us.</p>
<p>Our Huang Wei Corps, fiercely fighting with the bandits in the Shuangduiji area southwest of Suxian, has killed or wounded more than 25,000 bandits in the past ten days or so with superior artillery fire. Among them, the First and Ninth Columns of the Liu bandits and the Twelfth Column of the Chen bandits suffered the most damage. Upon inspection of the bandit corpses, the brigade commander of the 26th Brigade of the Ninth Column, Shou Wengao, and others have been killed by us. In the attacks on Shenzhuang and Zhouzhuang on the 6th of this month, the 20th Division of the Seventh Column of Chen Yi's bandit troops, which was reinforcing Liu's bandits, was completely defeated, killing more than 2,000 bandits and seizing more than 30 light and heavy machine guns, more than 400 rifles, and many other military supplies. The bandits in that area are currently building fortifications to defend firmly, and three columns of bandits have been transferred to support the east and north. As for the main part of the Sixth Column of Chen Yi's bandit troops south of the Feishui River basin, it has been defeated into scattered remnants by us. Although Liu's bandits transferred troops to reinforce, it was impossible to remedy the situation, and we are still continuing the mopping-up operation.</p>
<p>Our main force advancing north from Bengbu is eliminating the obstruction of the bandits in front, advancing step by step. The battle is currently taking place in the area north-northwest of Xinqiao, Caolaoji, and the Heji Baojiaji area (all west of Xinqiao Station).</p>
<p>(2) North China Theater</p>
<p>The treacherous bandits in North China have recently been plotting and stirring up trouble again. Since eight columns of bandits reinforced from outside the pass have entered the pass, Nie Rongzhen, in order to contain our forces and cover Lin Biao's safe concentration, specially led his First, Second, and Sixth Columns, and Li Yunchang's Eighth Column, together with the bandit military region's troops Zhan Danan's New Seventh and New Eighth Independent Divisions, totaling about 40,000 bandits, attempting to sneak attack our Zhangyuan and cut off the traffic on the eastern section of the PingSui Railway. Our forces had already detected their treachery in advance, and immediately coordinated with the people's armed forces to inflict heavy blows on the bandits in areas such as Chaigoubao and Taipingzhai and Dashizhuang southwest of Zhangyuan. The fierce battle started on the evening of the 2nd and continued until the 5th. Our forces, with high morale and proper application of strategy, achieved a great victory. The bandits suffered a total of more than 70,000 casualties. We captured a total of more than 2,170 bandit soldiers, more than 500 rifles, more than 20 machine guns, and more than 700 war horses, as well as many other baggage documents. Although a part of Lin Biao's bandit troops has arrived in eastern Hebei and the vicinity of the various passes of the Great Wall, they dare not act rashly due to Nie's recent disastrous defeat and fear of the unity and strong strength of our army and people. Our forces are searching for the remaining bandits in the north, south, east, and west areas of Tianjin and Beijing, and are waiting in strict formation. Due to the victory of our army in the outer areas of Zhangyuan, the situation in North China has become more stable recently.</p>

<h3 id="e38">UN Political Committee Passes Three-Nation Proposal: Recognizes the Legality of the South Korean Government, Establishes a New Korean Commission to Continue its Mission, and Withdraws Occupation Forces as Soon as Possible Within a Feasible Range <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] The UN Political Committee, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet bloc, passed a joint proposal by the United States, China, and Australia tonight with a vote of 41 to 6, with 2 abstentions, recognizing the South Korean government as the only legal government in Korea, and stipulating the establishment of a new Korean Commission, with the original nine countries of China, the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, India, and Ukraine re-elected as members. The committee has the right to travel throughout Korea and supervise the withdrawal of the US and Soviet occupation forces "as early as practicable." The proposal will be submitted to the General Assembly for approval. Even after the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky warned that he did not want to take office, Ukraine was still elected as a member of the committee. After passing this resolution, the Political Committee rejected the Soviet Union's hostile proposal to abolish the old Korean Commission with a vote of 40 to 6 and 3 abstentions. In addition to abolishing the old Korean Commission, the Soviet proposal also condemned the commission for dividing Korea and endorsing the South Korean elections held "under police oppression and suppression." Today's two resolutions have completed the work of the Political Committee in this session of the General Assembly. When the Political Committee began its afternoon meeting to hear the condemnations of the United States' actions in Korea by Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, and Yugoslavia, there were fewer than twelve countries present. The majority of countries under the leadership of the United States allowed the Soviet bloc to condemn without answering, so that they could vote quickly. During the morning meeting, when Soviet representative Malik accused US representative Dulles of being a liar, the two were only a few seats apart. When Dulles heard Malik's accusation, he took off his headphones and glared at Malik for the rest of his speech.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 9th] The news that the United Nations recognized the Republic of Korea was met with great rejoicing in this country, and nationwide parades and celebrations have been scheduled.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 9th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee declared today that the United Nations' recognition of the South Korean government as the national government of Korea will have a major spiritual impact on the people of North and South Korea. South Korean Foreign Minister Chang Taek-sang stated that the United Nations Korean Commission should be aware that there is still an iron curtain dividing Korea into north and south, and for this reason, South Korea must actively defend itself, prepare to be protected by US forces, and receive the spiritual support of the United Nations. A military spokesman said that South Korea hopes to train 100,000 troops by next summer. The current 50,000 are considered insufficient to defend against the Communists should they invade from the north.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Major Revision of British-American Plan to Mediate the Arab-Israeli Dispute to Facilitate Passage in the General Assembly <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] Western countries reluctantly cut important parts of their Palestinian mediation plan on the 9th, striving to have the plan passed by the General Assembly before it closes on Saturday. Official sources revealed that small Western countries, led by Canada and Australia, have drafted a number of extensive amendments to revise the British-American plan. Britain and the United States knew that the original plan had no possibility of passing the General Assembly, so both countries had agreed to revise it in advance. The General Assembly will begin its final debate on the evening of the 9th or the 10th. The General Assembly now has two paths to follow: one is to approve the greatly reduced British-American proposal; the other is to stand by and watch Palestine be in a state of war without assistance. The reason why Britain and the United States are willing to revise the original plan this time is nothing more than to urge the Arab side not to oppose the mediation plan and to weaken the status of pro-Arab countries. The Arab bloc had threatened that if the Security Council approved Israel's accession, they would fight to the end and would never support the revised mediation plan. Some people intend to propose postponing the vote on Israel's membership. France and Canada are also not very willing to vote to allow Israel to participate, which has a pivotal influence on the Security Council's vote. Western representatives are still discussing how and where to revise the British-American plan, but it is known that the revisions currently under consideration include the following: (1) The proposal will absolutely not mention last year's United Nations Partition Plan, or the Bernadotte Plan that subsequently revised the Partition Plan. (2) All instances of the words "State of Israel" in the proposal will be deleted. (3) The original plan stipulated that the five powers had the right to select three countries to organize the mediation committee. Now it has been decided to cancel this and let the General Assembly elect the three-country committee itself.</p>

<p>Social Committee Rejects Zhu Group's Motion</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] The Soviet bloc today demanded in the UN Social Committee that the General Assembly postpone the discussion of the Declaration of Human Rights, claiming that this kind of declaration is unsatisfactory, hinders sovereignty, and cannot condemn fascism. The Soviet bloc's motion was rejected by a vote of 26 to 6. The Declaration of Human Rights will still be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Security Council to Reconsider Membership Applications of Portugal, Italy, etc. <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] The General Assembly overcame Soviet opposition on the evening of the 8th and passed an African proposal asking the Security Council to reconsider the membership applications of seven countries, including Portugal, Italy, Austria, Finland, Transjordan, Ireland, and Ceylon. The reason why the Soviet Union rejected the previous membership applications of the seven countries was that the Security Council did not approve the membership of Outer Mongolia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and other Soviet satellite states. However, the rejection of Ceylon's membership application was based on technical reasons. According to current indications, Ceylon may be approved for membership when its membership application is reconsidered.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] The Security Council Special Committee limited the Palestinian and Jewish sides on the 8th to withdraw from the Negev area and conduct comprehensive truce negotiations within 48 hours. The committee stated that unless appropriate steps are taken to comply with the above orders, the Security Council itself will convene an emergency meeting, possibly on the 11th. Before the committee took this action, Britain had warned that "if the Jewish army launches any large-scale aggression against Transjordan, Britain may be forced to take action against Israel."</p>
<h3 id="e43">Sabotaging Nationalization of Japanese Coal Mines Bribe Case: Shigeru Yoshida Suspected of Involvement; Kijuro Shidehara, Takeo Inukai, and Hitoshi Tanaka Implicated <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida is now also suspected of involvement in a bribery case, the extent of which is comparable to the Showa Denko bribery case that recently led to the arrest of Hitoshi Ashida. It is said that this bribery case involves many members of parliament and political figures who are said to have received bribes from coal mine operators to obstruct the passage of the Coal Mine Nationalization Bill. Japanese political figures, who are feeling nervous due to the government's comprehensive purge of the House of Representatives, are now known as the "panic group." The size of this group is beyond general expectations. Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Man'itsu Tanaka, may be arrested because he is also involved in the Coal Mine Bill bribery case. It is rumored that Shigeru Yoshida's son-in-law, Taekichi Aso (a public figure in Kyushu coal mines), handed over a large sum of money to Tanaka and Kijuro Shidehara, a former prime minister who served as an advisor to the Yoshida Democratic Liberal Party, through his father-in-law, to obstruct the passage of the Coal Mine Nationalization Bill. In addition, Takeo Inukai is also suspected. He was originally the most promising candidate for the president of the Democratic Party after Ashida's arrest.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Takeo Inukai Elected President of Japanese Democratic Party <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The result of the bitter struggle between Kijuro Shidehara and Takeo Inukai for the presidency of the Japanese Democratic Party was concluded on the afternoon of the 8th when the party held its final general affairs meeting. After the general affairs meeting decided to appoint Takeo Inukai as president and Wataru Narahashi as vice president, Yoshizo Shidehara, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, expressed his intention not to participate in the election at the general affairs meeting election. Today, the party held a party convention, in accordance with the decision of the general affairs meeting. Takeo Inukai was once purged after the war, but he eventually avoided punishment through cunning means.</p>

<p>[United Press, The Hague, 8th] The Dutch cabinet convened an emergency meeting today to discuss the stalled Dutch-Indonesian peace talks. Foreign Minister Stikker and Overseas Territories Minister Sassen returned to the country from Batavia last night, and are said to still intend to recommend to the government that a provisional government of the Indonesian Federation be established within a month, stipulating that the Republic of Indonesia can join later. However, there are also those outside the Republic of Indonesia who oppose the establishment of a provisional government before next year, so the situation is quite complicated. Well-informed sources said that the cabinet will not make a decision until the parliamentary investigators return from Indonesia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett denied at a press conference on the 8th that the current Dutch-Indonesian negotiations and Indonesian issue have "broken down" due to Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker's return to The Hague from Java. He said that the Dutch Embassy here had notified the State Department that Stikker and his colleagues had decided that they should return to the Netherlands for discussion because their work was based on the government's instructions. Stikker went to Java two weeks ago to inspect the situation there.</p>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 9th] Boggs, a diplomatic analyst for the Sydney Morning Herald who participated in the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, said on the 9th: "The Soviet delegation was quite pleased with the approval of Indonesia's membership." He also said: "After the Netherlands withdraws from this session, we will surely hear more news."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Yogyakarta, 8th] According to the Indonesian news agency, a senior official said that the Economic Committee's permission for Indonesia to participate is a "spiritual" support for the Republic's cause.</p>

<p>Continue Working in Germany for Another Year</p>
<p>[United Press, Beirut, 8th] The Committee on External Relations of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) heard the suggestion from MacArthur's representative inviting the UNESCO to improve the thinking of the Japanese people after today, and unanimously decided to extend the UNESCO plan to Japan so that the Japanese people's thinking can tend to democracy as soon as possible. The committee also passed a resolution to continue cultural and educational work in Germany for another year starting this year to help guide the German people's psychology towards democracy. The US representative suggested that the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization hire experts to study and report on the techniques and methods used by Germany and Italy before World War II to create fascism. The UNESCO plan in Germany has not been fully implemented due to the Soviet occupation zone's refusal to cooperate. Implementation in Japan may not encounter any difficulties. It is said that Japanese youth and student groups are deeply interested in the guidance of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Japanese people are eager for international groups to allow them to join.</p>

According to regulations, they should fly at an altitude of 3,300 feet. The US side's reply only stated that it would continue to notify US pilots to abide by the rules.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett confirmed at a press conference today that preliminary discussions on the Atlantic Pact will begin on Friday afternoon of this week. According to well-informed sources, there are currently two different claims among the countries involved. The United States and Britain advocate that the Atlantic Pact should imitate the Pan-American Agreement and last for ten years. France, Canada, and other countries advocate that it should focus on military affairs and imitate the Brussels Treaty, lasting for fifty years.</p>

<p>To Prevent Communist Espionage Activities</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference on the 8th, when discussing the evidence given to the House Un-American Activities Committee by former Communist Chambers, that the State Department's code system, after being stolen and compromised between 1947 and 1948, has now been changed to the latest model and is more secure against espionage. Chambers presented this stolen document, helping Undersecretary of State Poorlifoy to point out that this meant "our telegrams were eavesdropped on by foreign countries throughout this period." When reviewing the State Department's efforts to keep secrets, Luo said that he knew that the State Department's code work was now much safer than before in preventing the leakage and theft of official documents. He said that today's cryptography work is completely different from the codes used ten years ago.</p>

Bevin said that we deeply hope that the Soviet side can lift the blockade of Berlin, and there is still hope for a unified Berlin currency.</p>

<p>[United Press, This City] Admiral Badger, Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, will hold a press conference on the 10th.

However, based on the Chongqing statement from the US Consulate, it is generally believed that Badger can only answer that the requests of American industrial and commercial personnel in this city will be fully considered, but a definitive answer must come from Washington. Senior officials at the consulate reaffirmed on the 9th that American businesses in this city had made the aforementioned request, and Shanghai Electric Power Company specifically submitted a request. Company officials also confirmed the news of requesting Marines to protect overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Five students from the US Art School, including Lu Lingyun, Lu Hanhua, Chen Liping, Wu Shuzhi, and Liu Ming, were accused of participating in the "Anti-American Support for Japan Movement." The case was previously prosecuted by the special criminal court prosecutor. The special criminal court held a trial yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Shen Tiqian. The Municipal Bar Association's People's Legal Aid Society sent five lawyers, including Ai Guofan, Li Wenjie, and Song An, to appear in court to provide voluntary defense. The main points of the defense are three: (1) The evidence of the defendants' crime is insufficient. (2) "Anti-American Support for Japan" is to oppose the US policy of supporting Japan, not to oppose the United States. (3) The prosecutor's indictment cites Article 100 of the Criminal Law, and the cited provisions are too severe and do not conform to the facts. After the interrogation, the court ordered the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 16th of this month.</p>

Datong relied only on Chen Zengliang, Gao Hongxing, and others to support the endgame. In the women's group, Datong had Zhou Ruihua, Wang Qifeng, and other famous players in Shanghai. Although St. John's had the entire Shanghai swimming representative Cheng Jinshen and veteran Zhuang Yaxian helping out, the players were not familiar with the new ping pong rules and had to retreat in defeat. The men's group results are as follows:</p>
<p>St. John's Datong Score</p>

St. John's counterattacked, and Peng Xianguang led the ball to attack, kicking the ball into the crossbar in front of the goal. Center forward Zhu Dehui added a kick, and Jiaotong Chen Deruo's goal was first opened. After Jiaotong first conceded a goal, their kicking became increasingly rough. St. John's kept a low profile and had no intention of attacking the goal. Jiaotong's Zhang Shouchang calmly dribbled the ball into St. John's goal, tying the score at one all in the first half. After switching sides, Jiaotong's style did not change. Under the threat of Jiaotong, St. John's goal was opened again by Zhang Shouchang. After the game, Jiaotong's goalkeeper Chen Deruo even stepped forward to punch St. John's hero Zhu Dehui, which is regrettable. St. John's finally lowered their heads and conceded defeat by a score of 2 to 1.</p>

On the center line, Meng Yiliang possesses the courage of ten thousand men. The forward line is currently the most complete among all strong teams. Afu in the center forward position poses a significant threat. Luo Shoufu and Jin Lusheng on the left flank, and Fei Chunhua and Gu Yisa on the right flank, are well-coordinated and incredibly sharp. According to the latest news, national team players Gao Baozheng and Gao Xiuqing will return to their former team to serve, further boosting their fighting power.</p>
<p>Dongxing represents the spirit of Northeast China. The team once defeated Donghua with a score of 3-1. During their expedition to Shanghai, they won three matches and drew one, further highlighting their impressive record. Zheng Bingyi in defense and Wang Baoshan in central defense are both bold and rare talents. Forward Chen Qin is short and agile, while Jiang Kun is versatile and resourceful. In addition, Zhang Jiliang takes command as the central leader, commanding the three armies, despite having limited goal-scoring opportunities. Northern players Xin Fuzhen and Wu Qixiang, the nation's number one right-back, offer their assistance, displaying the mighty power of an iron gate, which strengthens the defense and makes opponents feel like they are facing an insurmountable barrier. In short, this match features almost all of Shanghai's top players. At that time, various magical and exciting scenes will emerge endlessly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Ruiying, a former agent of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army, was stationed in Changzhou. He was later detained by the enemy, defected, and relied on enemy forces.

After the victory, he went into hiding in this city and was arrested by the police. He was transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office of this city for investigation and prosecution on suspicion of being a traitor. Regarding the murder charges, because the case falls under the scope of ordinary criminal matters, it was ordered to be tried by the District Court.

<p>The financial market saw stable credit conditions yesterday morning, with a slight tendency towards easing at noon. Financial speculation was quite prevalent. Early in the morning, there were rumors that were favorable to gold currency and unfavorable to stocks, so Yongsha once fell to 27 yuan with no buyers, while gold currency moved in the opposite direction to stocks. At noon, the peak flattened, and foreign exchange transfer certificates were initially boosted by southbound capital, but later declined due to sales at high prices. The price at noon was 47 yuan.</p>

<p>The sugar market was weak again yesterday, with scattered transactions and a lack of confidence. Credit within the industry was still loose, but because Taiwan Sugar will be reporting its assigned prices again, sales have become stagnant, and purchases have become saturated. Prices for all grades continued to decline generally. No. 4 and No. 5 refined white sugar closed at 345 yuan, coarse sand at 315 yuan, and medium sand at 290 yuan, each falling by 10 to 15 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, sales of western-style tea and export boxed tea remained sluggish, but tea merchants, seeing that foreign exchange transfer certificates were reaching new highs, gradually reaching parity with foreign tea prices, and because the authorities had decided to restore export loans to assist exports, were gradually becoming more optimistic and adopting a more determined attitude. As a result, although transactions were stagnant, the situation was quite favorable. In terms of prices, they were more stable than before. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, tea merchants in places like Taijie were still very enthusiastic, and the process followed the trend.</p>

<p>Cloth merchants were all eager to sell goods for cash, and northern merchants were also constantly selling. Prices for all cloths opened flat, but due to the fierce supply, the market tended to decline. By noon, prices began to rise, but due to stagnant sales, the market still closed weak.

<p>Yesterday's artificial silk market was weak with consolidation. There were few transactions on the market, with both supply and demand clearing. Most retail investors were engaged in arbitrage trading. The silk weaving industry suffered dismal demand, and sentiment showed no improvement. No. 120 silk opened at 9,500 yuan at Guangtian Bridge in the morning and was sold off. Trading was slow in the middle of the day, and the market was dull. The asking price declined slightly by 200-300 yuan, hovering around 9,200 yuan. No improvement was seen until noon. Later, the market improved slightly due to some support from Hangzhou dealers. The opening price of Dongyang Jin San Ma and other brands was also quite weak, following the same trend. The market turned firm near noon, and the asking price rebounded. There were not many transactions overall, and the price range was also small.</p>
<p>The export price of raw silk showed no significant gains or losses. Foreign merchants' demand turned weak, and sentiment did not become optimistic. Yesterday's transactions were also rare. The domestic sales price slightly increased yesterday due to sluggish demand in recent days. The D-grade 78 evenness opened at 13,000 yuan, up 500 yuan. Superior grade raw silk and mixed lots of ordinary filature and spun silk all increased by 300-500 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk fabric market saw increased selling and turnover. External yarn prices fell slightly, sentiment was weak, and the market opened weak, declining all the way. Beimao opened at 7,900 yuan and 8,000 yuan, but there were few buyers. Subsequently, prices hovered between 7,400 and 7,500 yuan. Finally, the Hakka dealers sold off their positions, with frequent short-selling pressure. The market was full of closing-out sounds, and the asking price continued to decline by 200-300 yuan. By the close, trading had become a tail-end phenomenon. The market price ended without a clear resolution. Huaqiang closed at 7,300 yuan, Meiya closed at 7,400 yuan, and Dawei Ni fell to 35 yuan. There were few other transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Uneven Cotton Yarn Market <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn saw mixed performance. The market continued its weakness at the open. Later, Guangdong dealers saw relatively smooth demand, and the process revolved around firm grades. Near noon, due to the abundance of short positions, there was pressure to sell at high prices, and the market rebounded slightly at the close. As a result, only some grades saw improvement. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 12,000 yuan to close at 12,500 yuan, a gain of 500 yuan. The performance of other brands like Bao Guang and Jincheng Tiannv varied. 40-count Jincheng remained at its original level, while 32-count Blue Phoenix and Silver Moon showed slight gains. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 9,400 yuan, then, under the support of retail investors, the price rose to the 10,000 yuan mark.

<h3 id="e115">Active Tung Oil Market <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The tung oil market progressed rapidly yesterday. First-grade white oil jumped to 640 yuan per dan, and authentic Xihong also reached 580 yuan. The rest all showed a trend of rising prices. The reason is that due to the current turbulent situation, the supply of goods has decreased, while export merchants have seen a surge in foreign exchange transfer certificates in recent days. Also, because favorable export news has been frequently reported, the intention to be active has gradually revived, so the process shows signs of supply and demand imbalance.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Affected by the Current Situation, Export Industry Shows No Improvement <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Due to the recent situation, the export industry has also shown no improvement. Although the market for foreign exchange transfer certificates has trended upward, there is little hope for an increase in exports. Taking this city as an example, most of the larger export companies have already ceased operations.</p>
<p>Due to the reduction in demand for export materials, the market is stable, and the price is not proportional to the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Since its issuance, the market price of the latter has risen by 80% to 90%, but the price of export materials has remained the same, and tung oil and sausage casings have declined instead. Moreover, foreign importers are also refusing to accept futures due to the situation in our country, so the export industry also lacks development abroad.</p>

<p>— Xi Xia</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Bu Lei, a national policy advisor to the Presidential Office, dedicated himself to state affairs with utmost diligence, ultimately sacrificing his life. All scholars in the country who have read his writings and know his name, whether acquainted or not, deeply mourn him. Mr. Chen was meticulous in his conduct and comprehensive in his thinking. Reading his last testament, his arrangements were calm and unhurried, and his mind was clear. Even in the most trivial matters, he did not want to burden those left behind. From this, one can imagine his integrity and purity in self-preservation, and his righteousness and intensity in facing death. Ouyang Yongshu once said: "Since ancient times, all deaths return to nothing, only the saints and sages, though buried, are not extinguished." The spirit of Mr. Chen's death will probably never fade away. On the day of Mr. Chen's funeral in Hangzhou, I will record my observations and recollections from the times when I personally heard his voice and saw his countenance, paying tribute to his example. Now, we are separated by life and death. I am saddened by my thoughts, but lamenting is of no use!</p>
<p>Drafting Famous Documents; Showing His Talent</p>
<p>In February of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was convened in Nanjing. At that time, the purge was more than half a year old, and the Northern Expeditionary Army had settled Hebei. With the cooperation between Ning and Han, a new atmosphere emerged. The famous closing declaration was written by Mr. Chen. The text was more than 4,000 words long and provided a comprehensive review of the party's program, party principles, domestic and foreign policies. The analysis was clear and it was a brilliant text for uniting comrades after the Northern Expedition. During the conference, Yu Youren, Dai Jitao, and Ding Dingcheng were originally recommended to draft it. Mr. Chen was traveling in Beijing as the chief editor of the Shishi Xinbao (Times News). Dai, being a colleague at Tianshi Bao, invited him to rest at Tao Lu in Tangshan and discuss the draft. The draft was completed the next day, and Dai urgently took it to the city to hand it over to Mr. Yu. After reading it, Yu praised it repeatedly, without adding or subtracting a single word. It was then read aloud at the closing ceremony, and the entire audience was amazed. Afterwards, Yu playfully said to Dai and Chen: "I have a twelve-character comment on this article." Dai and Chen hurriedly asked. Yu said: "Not new, not old, half new, half old, new and old again." Then, they clapped their hands and laughed together. This was the beginning of Mr. Chen's writing of important documents within the party, and it was also the beginning of his literary reputation within the party. From then on, every plenary session declaration was entrusted to Mr. Chen to draft.</p>
<p>Calling Himself Weak; Gentle in Nature</p>
<p>Mr. Chen was short in stature, physically weak, gentle in nature, and rarely argued with others. When encountering frustrating things, he would retreat and call himself "weak," "a scholar," and "useless." Among his six sons, the fifth son, Sui, was the thinnest and weakest. He was often ill in elementary school and was often bullied by his classmates. Mr. Chen would stroke his head and comfort him, saying: "You are also weak, just like your father? Poor child!" His words contained boundless love.</p>
<p>The Wobbly Carrying Pole Never Breaks</p>
<p>Mr. Chen was weak and often ill. At first, he only suffered from mild insomnia, but due to long-term labor, lack of rest and adjustment, since the 20th year of the Republic of China, he had reached the point where he could not fall asleep without taking sleeping pills. Fortunately, his wife, Ms. Wang Yunmo, took great care of him, and he was still able to live with his illness, fulfilling his official duties until the end of his life, only one year short of his sixtieth birthday. I still remember that in May and June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chen lived in the attendant's room in Wuchang Yanzhi Ping. Japanese planes bombed Xujiapeng Railway Station, Luojia Mountain Airport, Hu Lin Yi Road, and other places, and he felt the shock every time. I went to visit him and asked if he was frightened. Mr. Chen said: "At the beginning of the Japanese bombing of Nanjing, I did feel threatened in spirit, but now I am used to it and no longer pay attention to it." He also said: "I am forty-nine years old this year, and I have already exceeded my father's lifespan. Even if I die, I will have no regrets." I said: "There is a local proverb in my hometown, 'The wobbly carrying pole never breaks.' Mr. Chen is close to that." Mr. Chen smiled.</p>
<p>A Good Story of Family Learning: Chen, Zhang, Cheng</p>
<p>There are many talented writers in the press, and speaking of those who have benefited from their elder brothers, Mr. Chen Bu Lei is quite similar to Zhang Dongsun. Zhang's elder brother, Meng Qu, was a renowned scholar in Wuzhong, and Dai Jitao once followed him. Mr. Chen's elder brother was the elder Chen Qihuai of Yingning, who was the chief editor of Tian Duo Bao in the past. Speaking of those who have benefited from their maternal uncles, Mr. Chen is also similar to Cheng Cangbo. Cheng's father-in-law, Qian Mingshan (Zhen Huang), was a famous scholar in Wujin. Mr. Chen's father-in-law, Yang Xunzhai (Min Zeng), was also a literary giant in eastern Zhejiang. The foundations of Chen, Zhang, and Cheng in Chinese studies are rooted in such sources, which is also a good story.</p>
<p>Heart Cold and Stomach Pain; Talking About the Xi'an Incident</p>
<p>When the Xi'an Incident occurred on December 12, 1936, Mr. Chen was in charge of the handover of affairs as the deputy secretary-general of the Central Political Committee. He arrived in Beijing from Luoyang three days earlier, so he did not go west with Chairman Chiang. However, he discussed the matters of conquest and rescue, and he was extremely nervous and could not sleep at night. Therefore, he was particularly hard-working. On the 14th, I was summoned to Beijing to assist with daily correspondence and miscellaneous affairs. On December 25, Chairman Chiang was rescued and returned to Beijing. On the 28th, Zhang Hanqing was tried. Chairman Chiang took a half-day break at Chen's residence at No. 23 Yihe Road. On the 31st, Shao Yuanchong's coffin passed through the river, and all the attendants returned. I returned to Shanghai on New Year's Day. Before leaving, Mr. Chen said to me: "The ancients often used the words 'cold heart' and 'stomach pain.' Although I knew the meaning in the past, I never really experienced it until I was in the real situation. Now, after the Xi'an Incident, I realized how true and accurate the ancients used words." As he spoke, he touched his heart and abdomen with his hand, saying: "The so-called cold heart, this little square inch of land truly has a cold feeling; the so-called stomach pain, the entire abdominal cavity is cramping. This is truly the case, not just empty words." I said yes and retreated, knowing that Mr. Chen's illness was deep. Fortunately, he got rid of all desires and faced everything with optimism, so he was able to live another twelve years, otherwise he would have left this world early.</p>
