<p>〔本報南京二日電〕總統二日頒令公布修正海關進口稅則，自即日起開始實施。此項修正稅慢，前由政院將所擬草案咨送立院審議，提經立院於六月廿九日第十六次會議報告後，即交由該院財政金融委會秘密審查，前於七月卅日提出附有修正意見之審查報告，於該院第三次秘密會議復經討論修正通過，咨覆政院，俟政院飭囹關務機構作施行之準備後，乃由總統頒令公布實施。按海關進口稅則計分十六貨類，六七二號列，其中除聯合國貿易暨就業會議通過之日內瓦協定所限定之各項協定稅率，F及我國同意認許之減讓稅率仍予遵守，對經建切需品與人民生活急需品之稅率，不予增加外，其餘凡屬奢侈品，非一般國民必須品或國內已可大量生產之貨物，且為保護工業計，各依其用途加工程序及與國貨關係（是否競銷品），分別將其進口稅率提高，平均較原訂稅率增加一至三倍，最高者達百分之二百，然亦有若干號列貨物為獎勵進口，決予免稅，茲誌修正海關進口稅則如次：</p>

<p>凡含有花邊·衣飾，或他種裴飾用材料之貨品，除按照貨品之稅則完稅外，應另徵從另百分之十</p>
<p>〔第四類附註〕本稅則所謂「絲」，係包括人造絲而言，所謂人造絲，係包括人造絲以外之人造纖維及其他供紡織用之合成纖維在內。</p>
<p>交紡紗由棉或毛及超過百分之五（按重量）之人造絲（人造纖維及其他供紡織用之合成纖維在內）製成者，應歸入絹紡人造絲類徵稅，如所含人造絲線（人造纖維及其他供紡織用之合成纖維在內）之重置為百分之五或以下者，則按棉紗或毛紗徵稅。</p>

<h3>國民黨中央　今開座談會　廣泛檢計黨務改進意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕國民黨黨務座談會三日開幕，聞總統不擬前往主持。該會之主要目的亦僅係就黨務提出意見，廣泛檢討，洪蘭友前擬就之改造方案，已決定不提會討論。會中另有許孝炎等所擬「改造本黨意見書」及李天民等所擬「改造辦法草案」等提出討論。會中所提出各項意見，如有具體做貢獻者，將另擬方案，惟會中并不作任何決議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕洪蘭友之黨務改進方案，尚待中央常會通過後，再呈總裁核閱後，交全會討論。該項方案之精神，據洪氏稱，乃在謀黨務與政治之聯鎖，以改革政治為改革黨務之動力。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕國民黨中央為聽取并徵詢留京中委及立監委同志對於改進黨務之意見，定三日起假國大會堂舉行黨務座談會，預計會期兩日，每日上午八時半至十一時半，下午四時至七時為開會時間，若干國大代表今要求參加該會，據國民黨中央表示，行憲國大閉幕後，曾舉行黨務檢討會一次，聽取國代同志之意見，其性質與本次座談會相同，此次座談會係為聽取立監委同志意見，故未邀國大代表同志參加，如渠等對黨務方面有若何意見，可逕向中央提出，固不必出席本次座談會也。</p>

<h3>社論　上海富豪的試金石</h3>
<p>救濟特捐的勸募限期，一再展延，規定至七月底止；可是上海區（包括無錫蘇州杭州寗波等地）的八萬五千億元，聞迄今尙募不到四分之一。日前總統在泥，對此事曾有所指示，昨天吳市長在戡亂肅奸宣傳大會中也已約略有所表示，希望上海的富豪個個人能够樂善好施，否則將由勸募而更進一步，以達成所負的使命。昨天下午上海區敎濟特捐勸募委員會開會，其決議情形，迄記者執筆時止，雖尙未知其詳，但我們相信；負責勸募諸君一定會給上海富豪慷慨布施的一個絕好機會。而上海的富豪淸夜自思，也一定踴躍輸將，發揮他們「民胞物與，」「己飢己溺」的爲善精神。</p>
<p>我們以爲：救濟特捐的勸募期限雖過，而勸募工作千萬不應卽行停止，不但不當停止，而且更該特別加强。其在擁有資財，大可助人的富豪，尤其應該看這次救濟特捐是他們自己做人的試金石。本來，濟困扶危是人人的天職，人類互助原屬天性，何况富豪旣有餘力，當此難胞載途，傷兵滿眼，一念不忍，自能解囊救助，用不着我們多說。不過，另有些看不透的守財奴，往往愛財如命，眞所謂「拔一毛而利天下不爲也。」所以耶蘇基督嘗說「要富人升天國比駱駝穿針孔還難。」然而，我們設想，上海的富豪大槪不致愚蠢至此。</p>
<p>天下事，「物不得其平則鳴，」故戡亂肅奸，決不能獨責之於前方拚命的將士，亦不能眼看匪區裏和戰塲上的難胞獨受其流離失所輾轉溝壑的痛苦，尤其不能專讓那些人去犧牲，去受苦，而我們一些還有餘力的人却只管窮奢極侈，以爲事不干己。」朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」的現象是決不會聽其長久的。社會有了這種病態，一定需要對症的藥！</p>
<p>今天上海的富豪們，假使眼光放得遠大一些，當然會想到，有財而不能散，散財而不使之善用，其結果於公於私，爲國爲己，都是不好的。何况我們讀了中共擁護共產國際情報局譴責南共決議的通吿以後，更可認淸中國共匪對待一般有產者（不問其爲大資本家或小資產階級）的眞態度是絕對淸算，不留絲毫餘地，那就更該知道政府的戡亂，社會的肅奸，固然爲了保障國家的獨立與民族的生存，而實際上最受保護的利益者就是有資財的富豪。明白了這一點，還不乘國軍積極掃蕩，共匪方圖掙扎的時候，趕快　其力之所可能，慷慨捐助，救濟難胞，救濟傷兵，救濟一般窮而無吿的苦難的人們，上爲政府抒憂，下爲社會求治，大而爲國家出力，小而爲子孫造福，難道眞要到了山窮水盡，共匪的刀放在他們的腦袋上纔捐獻出錢來嗎？記得兩年以前，潘議長曾說：「上海一市，豪華奢靡，爲全國冠，而何以抗日大戰，八年之間，受禍反較他地爲少？推厥原因，或由於過去幾十年來救災恤鄰的慈善義舉，也以上海的捐款爲首屈一指。所謂積善之市，必有餘慶，這還是要歸功於前輩長者樂善好施的餘蔭。」這些話，雖似近因果之談，然而也未嘗不可策勉目前上海的一般富豪。我們以爲：他們也一定能繼續前徽，發揚光大，再爲國家盡力，爲社會造福的。</p>
<p>最後，我們要奉勸上海有錢的諸公：何妨首先打聽一些匪區裏面從前過慣舒適生活的人們，而今何如？我們知道，有許多地方，一旦淪陷了，他們深悔不及早輸將，使國軍士飽馬騰，捍禦共匪於家鄉的境外。如今，上海還是一個比較最安定的地方，上海人還不有錢出錢，將來也恐噬臍莫及！而我們也要奉吿市長和勸募會諸君：應該趕快根據各方的檢舉報告，把上海比較有錢而尚不出錢的先生們，公開幾張名單出來，讓大家公評一番，看看究竟誰是「國人皆曰可捐」，就好動員社會大衆的力量，勸導這些富豪一一的捐出錢來，救苦救難，救國救己！</p>

<h3>不營私不徇情　新任金管局長就職　說明執行政策態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市新任金管局長林崇墉氏，於昨晨九時到局就職，央行俞總裁及各界人士往賀者甚衆。林氏於午後五時招待記者，說明今後執行管制政策之基本態度，略謂：金管局成立，七月於茲，在李局長領導之下，已樹立良好之基礎，其作風亦頗少可批評者，本人除邀循成規之外，當以不營私不徇情之態度，執行管制政令。本人認爲目前之管制法令，辦法上已無漏洞，至於執行之輕重緩急，當因事制宜，有一分寸。將來管理行莊之基本原則，即爲完全遵守銀行法，及加强管制金融條例之基本精神，如銀行法十七條三十二條三十三條四十三條等，旨在禁止行莊經營商業套用行款及假造虛帳，如能切實執行，不必再有其他法令補充，亦可收管理之實效</p>
<p>行莊業務　不入正軌</p>
<p>我國目前金融業之發展，級為畸形，行莊數目之衆多，爲並世各國所稀有，而信用之濫，亦爲任何時期所無。本市有若干行莊，　開支竟大於存款總額，而居然能維持過去，亦即說明其運用存款之收益，大於其開支，其業務之不入正軌，於此可見一斑。此類不正常之情形，可表示經濟情形之嚴重，如聽其縱續惡化，不但此種不健全之行莊將不能存在，即健全者亦將同歸於盡。</p>
<p>決不妨害　正當行莊</p>
<p>將業金管局對行莊之態度，為明是非興辦善惡。目前本市行莊之中，好壞相去不可以道里計，執行管制時，對業務健全者將予以應付之保護，決不妨害正當行莊之業務，對壞行莊決毫不容情，加以淘汰。</p>
<p>投機場合　均佈綫索</p>
<p>林局長最後復表示：政</p>
<p>府對取締投機囤積具有決心，一切可能之投機塲合中，均佈有綫索，按圖索驥，必可獲得人犯。本人於就職前會曾謁最　當局，陳明金融管制之成敗，不僅有賴金管局之努力，且亦繫於政府之態度。按金融管制，目的在安定物價，實爲全體升斗小民之生計打算，故應得各方面最大之支持，尤盼能取得輿論界之指導及合作。至於行莊之檢查，在外國本爲一種經常之制度，我國目前經濟混亂，故更爲需要。〔本報訊〕美國總統輪船公司二郵船，將於今午相繼抵滬；其一爲戈登將軍號，自小呂宋香港駛來，今日上午十一時到埠，明日中午十二時離滬經橫濱返美。又克利扶蘭號郵船，自舊金山經檀香山橫濱來滬，今晨十時到埠，停靠公和祥碼頭，明日下午二時半起椗，赴香港小呂宋，經檀香山返舊金山。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央航空公司派往美國考察實習之高級人員，昨已有數人回國。該公司向康凡爾造機廠訂購之康凡爾式雙引擎客機六架尙未交貨，因該項新式客機性能甚佳，每一引擎有二千四百匹馬力，每小時速率達三百英里，而升降不一定需要大規模機塲，故美國國內對此項快速客機之需求亦甚迫切，康凡爾廠內定單山積，中央航空公司之定貨尙須數月後始能運來中國。</p>

<h3>戡亂肅奸宣傳大會　議長喚起豪富　獻財共赴國難</h3>
<p>上海市各界戡亂肅奸宣傳大會，昨日上午八時假乍浦路文化會堂熱烈舉行。出席本市軍政機關及其他社團等代表千餘人，由吳市長·潘議長，國民黨市黨部主委方治，民社黨市黨部主委金龍章，總工會理事長水祥雲等任主席團。首由總主席潘議長致開會詞，略稱：「吾人今日在此舉行戡亂肅奸宣傳大會，各團體代表踴躍參加，足以代表全市民意之所歸，對戡亂肅奸工作，吾人環顧當前嚴重局勢，必須加强其認識，（一）勝利三年來，吾國未能積極從事生產建設，影響國際地位低落，胥由</p>
<p>共匪內亂</p>
<p>之所致。此輩民族敗類，爲實現其野心，不惜破壞協商，驅全國人民輾轉流離於貧窮飢餓死亡之溝壑，以謀使中國成爲第三國際戰爭根據地。共匪陰謀暴露後，政府忍無可忍，始頒佈戡亂總動員令，表示立塲與決心。最近翁院長「吿國人書」中更明確重申國策，將「和談」謠言一掃而空，今後國人必須明辨是非，以共赴國難之精神，實現戡亂建國目的。（二）共匪所作所爲，是叛國而絕非愛國，政府</p>
<p>進行征勦，是戡亂而絕非內戰，此點吾人必須認識。而當前之勦匪戡亂，乃爲保持國家獨立統一而作戰，全國民衆必須供獻其最大力量，爲前方作戰將士之後盾。吾人相信以上海市民之全力支持政府戡亂工作，必能迅速完成。更望在「有錢出錢，有力出力」原則下，豪門鉅富，充分供獻其財力，以應急需，共赴國難。（三）奸匪部屬中，不乏脅從附和之徒，深望此輩天良發現，及時悔悟，相信政府在國家民族之大前提下，決能不咎旣往，准其自新，早謀和平統一之實現。</p>
<p>市長指出三點</p>
<p>旋由吳市長致詞，渠於說明共匪中央委員會響應國際共產譴實南斯拉夫文吿後，並指出三點，（一）南斯拉夫狄托元帥因愛國而遭譴責，共匪公然響應共產國際文告，其毫無國家民族觀念，實已不打自招，彰彰明甚。（二）共產國際文吿中，對南國「土地私有」制度，拌擊甚烈，據此可見共匪宣傳之「耕者有其由」不過欺騙世人之假面具而已。（三）南斯拉夫以「人民陣綫」之罪名被譴責，共匪及其附和者則方以「民主陣綫」口號相宣傳，又何以自圓其說。</p>
<p>方治建議　制裁不仁</p>
<p>此後民社黨金主委龍章說明戡亂肅奸之意義及其需要後，國民黨方主委即席提出建議三點：（一）加緊出力出錢，消滅甘心出賣國家民族之共匪。（二）呼醒受欺份子悔悟來歸。（三）發動社會力量制裁爲富不仁者。當經全體熱烈鼓掌通過，即日以大會名義通電全國一致響應。宣傳大會於十時許結束，繼即放映電影，招待出席代表。會後戡亂總隊並決定即日組成十二個分隊，分赴全市各區開始宣傳工作。</p>

<p>右被吿因戰犯案件—（民國三十七年度偵字第一四五號），業經偵查終結，認爲應行起訴，茲將犯照事實及證據並所犯法條叙述如左：</p>
<p>（一）事實</p>
<p>被吿岡村寗次，日本東京人，於日本陸軍士官學校及陸軍大學畢業後，歷任陸軍少將軍事調查委員長，關東軍參謀副長，參謀本部第二部長，陸軍中將第二師團長，第十一軍司令官，睦軍大將第六方面軍司令官等職。中日作戰期中，民國三十三年十一月廿六日，被吿任中國派遣軍總司令官，所有在華陸軍作戰部隊，均屬被吿指揮監督。在其任職期間，其部屬對我平民時有發生殘殺搶劫及破壞財產之暴行，而案情重大經判決有案者，計：（一）陸軍第二十七師中將師團長落合甚九郎，于三十四年一月率部進犯江西省境，竄擾蓮花·永新·遂川·泰和等縣，殘殺我平民周浩平·馮王氏·王占明等八十九人，燒燬房屋六十五間。（二）陸軍第一一六師中將師團長　田原四郎，在三十四年四月至七月間，率部駐防湖南邵陽時，連續屠殺平民范月池等一百十人。（三）陸軍第六十四師團第五十五旅少將旅團長　岡壽男，駐防於浙江省·永嘉·樂淸等縣，自三十四年一月起至日本投降止，該部屬在兩地駐防期內，連續搶劫張德勳·張耀焜·趙典祥·徐宏芳·元生祥布店等八十四家財物，縱火焚燬黃修昌等十家房屋數十問及傢具衣服等件。（四）湖南長沙區中將警備司令船引正之，在駐防期內，於三十四年二月至四月止，該部屬在長沙·沅江·湘陰各地，連續殺害平民李甫先·楊正保等二十二人。（五）陸軍第二十三軍中將司令官田中久一，於三十四年間率部自柳州撤退時，縱火焚燬全城房屋，造成空前之浩劫。戰事結束後，岡村寗次經國防部發交本庭檢察官偵查起訴。</p>
<p>（二）證據暨所犯法條</p>
<p>按交戰國對於佔據地人民之生命及私有之財產均應尊重，此爲海牙陸戰規例第四十六條所明定。本案被吿，在中國派遣軍總司令官任內，其部屬於作戰期中或駐防區內所發生之暴行，均屬證據確鑿，（中略）被吿總綰軍權，對於所屬部隊到處肆施屠殺，搶劫及破壞財產，事前旣不加以防範，事後又未迅予制止，依照戰爭罪犯審判條例第九條之規定，自應員共犯責任，雖據辯稱其治軍紀律向極嚴明，其部隊即有不法行爲發生，亦曾嚴厲禁止等語，無非空言狡飾，冀卸刑責。按其在作戰期內，縱容部屬連　屠殺平民，搶劫並肆意破壞財產，實有違反海牙陸戰規例第四十六條，第四十七條之規定，並觸犯戰爭罪犯審判條例第二條第二款，第三條第一款，第二十四款第二十七款之罪嫌，合依同條例第二十六條提起公訴。</p>

<h3>輸管會昨已開始接受　申請輸入國外資金　港澳兩地是否適用尚在接洽中</h3>
<p>「僑資及國外資金輸入辦法」，輸管會霍寳樹昨表示已開始接受各方申請輸入。據霍氏稱：實施細則雖尙在政院之研討中，然爲加速是項物資之輸入，本會決定先行接受各方申請。若有朱盡明瞭者，本會可詳加解釋。又據霍氏表示：港澳兩地是否列爲國外，即是否適應本項輸入辦法，刻正微求工協商會等各方意見中。</p>
<p>又進出口貿易同業公會秘書長張耀章稱：港澳資金特殊化，決不合理。雖然港澳毘隣國境，貨物輸入，易引起外匯市塲波動及助長投機，但如加限制，則仍可能匯南洋歐美，仍作僑實輸入。故問題癥結，在通盤嚴格辦理，而不使港澳特殊化。</p>
<h3>市塲人心恍惚　華股疾升勁降</h3>
<p>華股昨兎起鶻落，永紗自漲停板加五十元起，曾有二千餘元之回風，午刻離跌停不遠，消息紛歧，人心恍惚，散戶及浮多鍜羽者多。　晨初雖承週六午後餘燄，益以增資及鉅鈔等流言，開出均秀，永紗竟開高至一三八六〇元漲停限度，惟公用事業一躍達六倍，不無戒懼，二二六號六五號等賣到一三七〇〇元，七六號四號等均進，尙屢迫漲限，曾加過五〇元。中興閘北永業聯華火柴漲停板，惟紗布實貨平庸，銀根帶緊，逢高有二二四號一六四號等紛售，退至一三〇八〇元。一七六號一二號等逢低略買，升爲一三二五〇元。不利流言頻傳，散多迫於銀根，六〇號一八〇號等力售，退至一一九五〇元收市。中泥獨吿漲停，較上週六計永紗火柴閘北漲停後有回，前者小挫，後者尙升半成及一成，中興聯地永業中泥漲停，華新恒豐升半成，勤興跌一成，美亞上泥景福新光內衣景綸華豐國貨小半成，新華商務中絲平平，餘股升降咸微。</p>
<p>後市永紗上場一三一五〇元，一六九號二二五號等進至一二七五〇元，一二九號八九號等一賣，立即下游至一二二七〇元。此後起仆飄忽，在一二五〇〇元內外拉鋸不已，臨收前曾由二一八號二一六號等進至一二八五〇元，一八五號九九號等逢高復出，回小到一二五〇〇元。國行交換差出，一七〇號一四五號等進至一二七〇〇元結束，較晨收計永紗美亞新光景福國貨華豐內衣各升半成，永公閘北微降，塲外各未上市股票，以交通大生華成交通升半成强爲倘利，文化股平脂而小疲，餘股僅平穩而已。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨初高繼回，各債榮辱殊微，成交亦不過二百萬。統丙晨開一二〇萬，高價一二六萬，不能持久，午刻退至一一六萬收市。較上週六，計甲乙戊各漲二萬元，丙升一萬元，丁種微降二萬元。</p>
<h3>銀根雖趨緊　行局有差出</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根微見緊勢。四行兩局一庫於銀錢業票據交換中依然差出共計八七五七億。計中央銀行差出一七八三三億，中國銀行差出四〇一五億，交通銀行差進一〇〇六二億，農民銀行差出九三億，中信局差進一三四四億，郵匯局差進一七八八億，中央合作金庫差出一〇億。商業行莊大交換差進一一四九〇億，小交換差出一一九〇九億。外商銀行共計差進九一七六億。</p>

<p>保險庫職員大忙</p>
<p>國行俞鴻鈞總裁昨鄭重否認市塲所謠傳之政府已決定將黃金收歸國有，凍結銀行保險庫二項重要措施之說。據俞氏稱：政府絕無其事，請勿輕信謠言。惟滬上人士，握有金鈔者，均紛紛前往存放銀行取提。自朝至暮，設有保險庫之各大銀行，其門若市。保險庫職員應接不暇，惟對於顧客爲何忽然一齊出動，成莫明其妙。</p>

<h3>臺糖一千五百噸　昨日起辦理核配</h3>
<p>方糖已在滬租廠製造</p>

<p>台灣糖業總公司上海辦事處，最近曾租就前英商太古製糖廠廠地，及其全部生財機器，並於上月份起，開始大量製造方糖。目前每日產量，已達四千磅左右，除少數供應本市需要外，多數均將出口運銷，爭取國外市塲，藉以吸收外匯。</p>

<h3>祁紅交易寂寥</h3>
<p>茶市昨晨開，英商出口行對於本年度祁門紅茶，即有還盤，但每祖僅出一億二三千萬左右，與貨方一億五千萬之喊價，距離仍遠，交易依然陰霾。惟邇來本街店莊尙有零星拆進，以應門售，致過程並不十分寂寞，其他花色，自指數砌升後，執主感於成本加重，因此扳抬之意，變本加厲，趨勢一路疾進。惜買戶畏高態度，不免袖手，遂又急遽回平。收市結果，均與上週相仿，無大軒輊。脚地則鞏固益甚，前途不脫緊勢。</p>

<h3>中信籌措經費　購監輸日易貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中日易貨貿易，雖繼續進行，但貿易數量殊少。我國輸出之主要物品，爲麩皮苧蔴豆餅等，輸入之大宗爲日本剩餘之窰木。食糧在以往之中日易貨中，爲我國主要之輸日貨物，惟今年因缺乏收購食鹽之資金，未能運出，中信局正　變贊日本呢絨，作爲收購食鹽之經費。</p>
<h3>呢絨由平轉堅</h3>
<p>呢絨市面，昨又由平轉堅，良以銀根業內外軋鬆，拆息下降一半有奇，兼受米價暴騰，水陸交通公用事業猛漲關係，中紡開個提漲半成，買賣雙方乃又以退爲進。惟昨茶會上及諸大批發戶，上下午成交仍無幾，大多數均待週三中紡開價更動與否爲轉移，現在仍形成互相擯竺之局面。</p>

<p>詎至十點半後，聞股市回挫，市上銀根趨緊，同時更傳當局對本市將設一管制物價之特權機構，撲滅投機囤積之惡風。長江幫阨於匯款，均有脫售，津川等幫亦來大量出籠，同時以流言利賣，暗中頻吐，人心頓吿虛弱，塲內有供無求，市勢下挫，喊價傾瀉，卒以五千七百五十萬元站五十萬，較週末回跌二百五十萬元。塲外跌去一成强，其餘各布市呈升降互見，惟起伏尙覺平穩，成交共計一千八百疋。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦八月一日電〕平等歐文斯世運記錄之本屆百米冠軍黑人徑賽健將狄拉特今日談稱：美洲黑人之所以專長於短跑者，蓋因彼等具有短時的衝刺能力，而無長跑之持久能力。繼稱：「實際上，黑人與白人之唯一區別，僅為皮色之不同而已。余不信任何神秘之解釋，以為黑人的肌肉組織較好，或以為我等皆白種人接近「自然」。我認爲黑人長於短跑，乃因彼等大都居住熟帶，具有適於短跑之遝動環境之故。」渠指出：「即使白種運動員，亦不能在九十度炎暑之下，跑畢五英里長跑。單就體力方面說，白人與黑人實毫無兩樣。雖然有很多黑人以短跑著稱，實亦不足爲奇」。</p>
<h3>李世僑尚未趕到　我選手團生活單調　中國廚師膳食可口</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦二日電〕我國世運代表團遷居基爾缽工藝學校，至今巳達一週，因該校設備不若鄂克斯橋世運中心，娛樂項目及運動器具，皆付　如，故各代表均有枯燥及失望之感。渠等對單調生活，頗有煩言，而除比賽日之外，多有無所事事之苦。自遷基校以還，我代表即失去觀摩各國代表在鄂克斯橋練習之良機，尤以不能參觀美國代表所採最新訓練方法為憾。唯新住處中國廚師甚多，膳食可口，為最大便利。鄂克斯橋則僅供西餐，佐以冷肉及蔬菜。若干代表刻昔赴基校附近，賞玩異國風光。多數因語言不通，出門為難，故皆踡伏臥室，玩牌作樂。最饒典趣者為代表團之職員諸公，其臥室在五層樓上，日需上下數次，故皆有運動過度，肌肉硬化之歎，蓋基校並無電梯也。職員中多曾參加一九三六年之柏林世運，且皆樂道彼時規模之龐大，設備之週到。唯徑賽代表，精神仍甚振奮，樓文放及黃兩正，於卅日比賽時雖皆名落孫山，但均無沮喪怨艾之意，且藉此頗獲經驗，尤以樓文敖雖兩脚起泡，終於跑畢全程，其勇毅之氣，甚為同隊所贊佩。籃球隊初戰失利，但士氣甚旺，與智利比賽時，不幸負傷　足者，現皆復原。且均摩拳擦掌，準備於今晚哈林蓋再對比利時一戰中，獲得初次勝利。前鋒李世僑能否趕到參戰，刻尚不能決定。</p>

<h3>萬米決賽　名次爭執　有人少跑一圈　挪威如此抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八月一日電〕斯坎的那維亞田徑賽幹事對於上星期五萬米決賽時，很多選手的名次被錯列一事，成感不平，認為此乃「國際競賽中罕見之莫大醜事」。</p>
<p>挪威田徑隊領隊諾侖稱：田徑賽幹事將選手應跑之圈數錯計，以致至少有十二人少跑一圈。諾侖稱：椰威選手克傑爾森被官方列為第十八，若田徑幹事們未於二十圈之後少計一圈，則克氏應爲第八或第九名。</p>
<p>諾侖稱：克兄傑爾森察覺幹事之錯誤，自動跑畢全程，惟其他選手，包括比利時之埃弗拉，及荷蘭之拉脫斯特，均少跑一圈。</p>
<p>諾侖個人最感痛心者，厥為斯托根與瑞典之鄧霍夫，由官方列為第五及第六，雖經瑞典與挪威之田徑幹事提出抗議，終未將其名次改動。</p>
<p>諾侖稱：鄧霍夫自稱渠於斯托根之後，為完畢全程之第五人，渠稱；「賽後我等即向田徑總幹事胡爾特提出抗議，胡氏答應改正。至星期六，官方記錄上仍未見改動，現當局謂，此事將於球賽結束後解決」。</p>

<h3>懷念</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>愛華離開我的時候，我哭了！如今東子昂離開我，我又哭了！</p>
<p>他們都是我的所謂僕人，可也都是我的朋友。</p>
<p>我義慕一般人常常三天換一個傭工，兩天換一個傭工，雖然一般人以此為苦，可是總比我每次和傭工相處旣久，一且分別，就不免戚然之感的滋味好些。</p>
<p>愛華和束子昂，同樣為了不甘畏此下去，乃各奔前程。愛華臨走時告訴我：離開了我，餓死不再為奴，除了服侍我，這世界上她不會再服侍任何人，因為任何人也不會像我這樣尊重她，把她當作朋友。於是我同情她的志氣，我放她走了。如今她在一家紡織廠做工，前天她來看我，我欣慰她的生活有了保障，她終竟學成了一種技藝。</p>
<p>愛華走後，束子昂來了，他是一個年靑力壯的北方小夥子，抗過戰，在一位親戚那裹當兵，兩年前親戚把他轉莽給我，因為他會作麵食，帮助我的胃病兩年未發。朋友們常勸告我，用男孩子不方便。可是我獨不以為然，我自己就有着男孩子的性格，我沒有一般小姐們的習氣，瑣碎事我自己作，衣服由隣居的老媽子給我洗，他只替我燒飯，跑腿。可是他有一顆上進的心，他選了一行性之所好的汽車業，他願望將來作司機，他說：</p>
<p>「我先去學，學會了再回來，一面給你燒飯，等您有了汽車，一面我還給您司機。」</p>
<p>「我不會有汽車的。」我笑了。</p>
<p>「您總不能窮一輩子。』他很肯定地說。</p>
<p>這使我想起，去年為了我在東万雜誌發表一篇「桃李秋風」，紀念我的淪為一個拉黃包車的學生的文章，被一位在杭州學駕駛汽車的讀者看到，他感動地寫了封信給我，說等他畢業以後，來跟我當司機。我告訴他我不是汽車階級。他又說，他等到我有汽車的時候。如今束子昂也這樣講，我心裏想：汽車還沒有影子，司機倒頸約了兩個，眞令我啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>為了成全束子昂的志願，我托了朋友把他介紹到蘇州的輜汽教導團去學習開汽車，行前他向我辭別，他流着淚股殷勸我保重，勸我少喝酒。我頻頻點頭接受他的好意，送他到樓梯口的時候，我的眼睛糢糊了！回到書房，想着人與人之間，如果沒有感情就少許多苦惱！而偏偏我又是最車感情的人。</p>
<p>抗戰前我用過一個男僕，至今還有信來，我不斷匯些錢資助他。他現在河甫，等火車通了，他要再找到我，伺候我。他是一個最義氣的人，記得有一次我生病，他把我的藥偷偷多煎了一碗，他跪在院子裏對天為我祈禱，然後他就把那碗藥喝下去。其愚誠可想而知。</p>
<p>愛華和束子昂也是很義氣的人，他們懂得我的生活，了解我的性格，愛華從來不向我要求加工錢，我自動加了，她總謙辭許久。束子昂只要看見我哪一頓飯吃少了半個饅頭，他會認眞地皺起眉頭；哪一頓我若是多吃了一個饅頭，他也會認真地高與起來。這一切，都使我由衷的感動，由衷的安慰。</p>
<p>爲什麼他們會對我這樣？難道是我的幸運，因為我巧遇了好人嗎？不，我相信，世界上沒有絕對的壤人，只是看你怎麼待他。你給他一分情，他就會給你一分義！你愛他，他不會無緣無故地恨你</p>
<p>我的朋友常笑我對待僕人太民主，比如他們偶然作錯了事，我　替他們找出理由來原諒他們。他們工作之餘要出去玩玩，我絕不干涉，而且我為他們設法看免費電影。有時我還同他們一道娛樂。我坐在屋裏，他們也可以坐在一邊和我講話。（這在別人是絕對看不慣的。）每逢過年過節，他們敬我酒，我也回敬他們。總之我們之間是平等的，是無階級的。為什麼不可以呢？他們和我是一樣的人；有一樣的獨立人格；他們只是為了比我更窮，才出賣勞力，來帮助我所不能，而謀生活，也正如我不得不為生活寫文章出賣心血是一樣。所以，我沒有理由不尊重他們。我的出版家也沒有理由不尊重我。這心情我是自幼養成的，孩子時代我就和小丫頭們交朋友，我從無主僕觀念，我一向不把他們視作奴隸，因為每個人的本身都有奴隷成份，每個人的頭上都有更高更大的權威者，因此，儘管你把他們當奴隸，也有人會把你當奴隸，同時他們又何嘗不是權威者，至少，他們的兒女就是他們的奴隸</p>
<p>但，我的脾氣是不是眞好呢？不！一年裹頭我也會發一次兩次怒，怒起來就像雷，只霹靂一聲完事，我不喜歡嘮叨，心裹也絕不存芥蒂不過我這種怒不一定專發在我的僕人身上，也許我對那些一權威者怒的機會更多。</p>
<p>然而，我確是對愛華束子昂他們怒過，儘管當時我怒得有理，可是現在想來，我懊悔了，我曾經使他們的心靈受到壓迫！我為什麼不控制呢？</p>
<p>如今，愛華束子昂都相繼去了，他們留給我的是一團仁義的記憶；我應該還給他們什麼呢？是滿腔懷念的熱情！</p>
<p>抹去眼角的淚，我默默為愛華束子昂祝福！</p>
<h3>「高貴」的音樂</h3>
<p>— 友亭</p>
<p>此時此國，藝術與人生，似已脫節，而且趨於兩極。</p>
<p>以數量較多的中間階級論（即一般的依薪水為生者），茍於從業之餘，果腹之外，竟亦饑渴於鋼琴·唱片·收音機以及交響樂會的入塲券，便難免被無情的現實譏為「附庸風雅」，易以新筆法，即：「跟布爾喬亞學時麼！」</p>
<p>比如說鋼琴，音樂的基要器具，不論你學什麼，都必修鋼琴。是故不談音樂則已，否則，身旁就少不了一具鋼琴。即使光是「欣賞」，對此亦不可門外，因為鍵盤之上，包含無盡的音樂常識；如照文明國家的習慣，那更是：「有孩子的地方就該有鋼琴」。</p>
<p>然在中國，鋼琴大都陳列於上海的琴行裹，喊價廿餘億；還有則裝飾於豪富的客廳斜角，上置美麗鮮花及石膏像，琴蓋終年上鎖；還有則被倔於歌台舞榭，日以繼夜地，咆哮其面目全非的音樂。而音樂學府裏、反閙琴荒。</p>
<p>那麼，鋼琴當然與凡人無緣；以此推論，眞正要攻習音樂，似非布爾喬亞莫屬，但事有出奇者：在中國，家置Grand　Piano的公子哥兒，未必眞懂音樂之魔力，類多以此點綴豪華而已。他們果眞世代瘋狂於藝術，今日決無力能家置大鋼琴；相反的，「窮公教一，一般職業靑年，淸寒學生，却大多數眞正沉醉於藝術，偶爾從路旁收音機傳出一首鋼琴協奏曲，會使他駐足不前，偶爾路過一家琴行，便會對着樂器發呆。然而現實却把這批人跟音樂之間，劃下一道鴻溝。</p>
<p>當然，也有許多職業靑年，可能省吃儉用來租琴學習，但是勝利後一年，琴租每月只六萬元左右，而最近半年以來，老租戶的琴租，每月上漲百分之百以上，七月份月租已為一千五百萬元（十分舊的琴），新租琴則開價兩千五百萬到三千萬，琴租的上漲，超過了生活指數。今後，許多鋼琴的租戶，恐怕都將向鋼琴揮淚告別了。音樂畢竟與「凡人一無緣</p>
<p>然而，最重要者：這般職業靑年之傾倒音樂並不由於希望成名，或登臺演唱受人喝采；他們深知學音樂之能有成就，必須自小專攻，長期的苦工之外，還得有先天才能，決無任何人一舉便可成「家」之奇蹟。今日許多業餘學習音樂者，都在已十分遲暮了的「音樂年齡」才開始學習，明知自今以後，即化了十年廿載的時間也無「奇蹟」可以發現，但由於强烈的愛好，或者由於個人的遭際，由於對時代的苦悶，深覺唯有音樂可資慰藉，於是他們如饑如渴地追逐着音樂，但時代却把音樂高高地吊起，不讓凡人接近！</p>
<h3>平湖西瓜</h3>
<p>— 盛吾</p>
<p>西瓜是消暑雋品，在上海瓜市中，我們平湖的西瓜，要佔着首位。平心而論，平湖西瓜的確自有特色，牠不像嘉興新豐出產的有酸味，也不像嘉善西瓜的淡而無味，更不像海寗西瓜肉不脆。平湖瓜確是「旣脆又甜」，適合口味，西瓜子又少，黑得明亮發光。</p>
<p>專門做　的商販們，在陰歷五月底前後，就下鄉去把生在田裏還沒有完全成熟的瓜，蓋上了印子，各人有各人的記號，表明這些瓜巳經受了人家的「文定」。去年做西瓜生意的人，掙錢的多，但是晨家却在呌苦，許多人都給商人欺騙了，款子一拖，損失極車。因此今年就聰明了，上海與平湖間相距甚近，農人們便預備「自種」自運「自賣」。家家戶戶，都種了一二畝至十畝以上，量可在八百最初的預算，如果雨水調勻，產萬個以上，平湖也許變成「瓜山」一瓜海」。然而，——老天不從人，幾天梅雨，把瓜根爛了六成以上。瓜發育的當口，受着雨點，成了「麻皮」瓜，又難翁，又容易爛，肉質也變了味，結果，存下來可以外銷的，不過十分之二，不及上年度產量三分之一。</p>
<p>前一星期上海西瓜行情，每祖三百萬而已，這幾天已漲出一千萬大關上海人在立秋日後，吃西瓜的人就少了，現在離立秋佳節祗不過六七天，近幾天又特別苦熱，平湖西瓜在上海，正是黃金的時代。而那些西瓜商販呢，平湖人是稱他們為「西瓜大少爺一的，這幾天也一定更形活躍了。</p>
<p>平湖西瓜的產地，遍及全縣，以大南門外的亭子橋一帶為最佳。今年能運上海的瓜類約八九十萬隻。好瓜都到了上海，我們平湖人倒很少吃着好西瓜了！（寄自平湖）</p>
<h3>美國點滴</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>女據美國柯里安週刋毛刊稱：美國陸海軍當局已挑選少壯軍官二百人，叫他們學習俄文。</p>
<p>柯立芝，胡佛，羅斯福等三位美國總統在外面吃飯的時間很少，杜魯門却正和他們相反，他特別喜歡應幾作老朋友之邀小叙。</p>
<p>艾森豪威爾主要的消遺是打Bridge，手法相當高明。一度傳說要競選副總統的美國大法官道格拉斯（民主黨）却喜歡收藏名人的簽名，他巳經搜集了美國每一任大總統的簽名。</p>
<p>美國民主黨的經濟恐慌極端嚴重，捐款寥寥，人不敷出，紐約州，加州，和德克撒斯州本來對羅斯福競選時都捐過不少錢，但這次對社魯門却袖手旁觀。</p>
<h3>裸體首相</h3>
<p>— 南無</p>
<p>珍珠港事變爆發後半個月，邱吉爾率領了英國參謀部最高級的將領，到了美國。</p>
<p>英相成為白宮的上賓，他住在總統府樓上的客室裹，和羅斯福總統手下第一名紅人霍布金斯的房間遙遙相對。白宮的樓上本來很靜，難得有人走動，這時却一變而為大英帝國的大本營，文武要人挾蒲公事包來往不絕。白宮的菜也比平日豐盛了，佳釀當然也常常出現。</p>
<p>據霍布金斯告訴別人說，有一天，羅斯福總統坐了輪椅，到了英相的房裏。不想從浴室裘面跳出來的却是一個精赤條條的邱吉爾！但見此公剛出浴，身上一絲不掛，擦得通紅。羅斯福大吃一驚，連忙道歉不迭。邱翁却不以為意，再三聲明沒有關係。他漂亮地說：「大不列願的首相對美國的大總統無需有所掩飾</p>
<p>羅斯福總統的另一智囊休伍特（他是著名劇作家，羅斯福的演辭有不少是他提刀的）就去問邱吉爾這件事是否可靠。邱吉爾忙說「完全胡閙」。他說，他見總統時，至少身上浴巾總是圍一條的。接着，邱吉爾狡獪地說，「我會對總統說什麼無需掩飾的話麼？我就是說了總統也不會相信呀！」（摘譯休伍特編憐的「霍布金斯秘記」）</p>
<h3>也記吳清源</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>本報載禺壽君記吳淸源在日本棋院各事，紀述綦詳，吳為當代黑十第一手，年富力强，前程無限，曩在我國，竟無以自瞻，乃為日人羅致以去，良可慨也。</p>
<p>億民十三四年間，吳尚在　　，即負盛譽，嘗偕其兄至中山公園春明館奕棋，當者輒靡，時段芝泉氏執政北平，乃月致津貼，伏其奕讀。嗣段氏下　，吳憔悴京塵，竟無所遇。民十六年，曹汝霖自日抵平，偕日本六段名手某同至，（已忘其名，或即禹壽君所記之七段瀨越憲作）邀平市善奕者與角，一時老手，畏不敢應，乃推吳約期前往，蓋吳年幼，敗亦無妨，勝則大可驕人，期固李唐時代對高麗太子之故智也。</p>
<p>曹將前門外靑雲閣茶樓全座包定，為下棋所，登報招集同好，如期往觀，是晚不期而會者約二百人，濟濟一樓，極一時之感。吳執黑子，與日人奕於樓中小室內，而於室外設四大桌，桌各置揪枰一，以二人司之，室內每下一子，即有八高聲報明，室外四桌，即照式擺子，羣衆圍觀，竊竊評論。吳下子甚捷，日人則愈下愈綏。吳體瘦年小，弱不勝衣，日人年三十許，體基健碩，屹坐如山，人皆恐吳不敵，代為皇室，聞報一子，　冀吳得勝着，嗣則愈下愈緊，羣情亦愈緊張，漸至生死關頭，羣情益急，其時吳子似着着佔先，可操勝算，不料日人忽下一子，觀衆皆為失色，認為此子之妙，大足挽回頺局，成敗已未可定，乃吳隨應一子，觀衆又復大慰，齊稱神着，認日人前子，已無能為力。許久，日人又下一子，羣情惴惴，謂此子甚為利害，能使將敗之局，變成一刦，將來打刦如何，尚不知鹿死誰手。旋吳又應一子，於是衆心大定，謂刦已不成，基可必勝，竊竊贊美之聲，紛起於四座矣。嗣後久之又久，日人迄未下子，時鐘已達十一句餘，室內發言人即當衆宣稱：時已夜深，不及終局，現將此局繪圖，日後再定期完局，屆時仍登報請觀云云，後經多日，報端始見登載，謂此局日人承認已負，不再完局矣。當對奕時，雙方均全神貫注，日人兩手抱顯，目注棋枰，歷時甚久，始下一子，吳應甚速，然瘦小白面之上，已靑筋暴露，送往之茶點水菓，均無暇食。最有趣者，室外人多擁擠，吳年旣小，似畏不敢出，小便時乃由茶房抱之出外，又復抱之入內，今日回憶前塵，猶宛然在目也。</p>

<h3>Amendment to Customs Import Tariff - Presidential Decree Promulgated and Implemented - Taxes on Luxury and Non-Essential Goods Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The President issued a decree on the 2nd promulgating the amended Customs Import Tariff, effective immediately. This amendment to the tax rates was previously drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. After being reported to the 16th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on June 29th, it was referred to the Finance and Monetary Committee of the Yuan for secret review. On July 30th, a review report with proposed amendments was submitted. After further discussion and amendment at the Yuan's third secret meeting, it was sent back to the Executive Yuan. After the Executive Yuan instructed the customs authorities to prepare for implementation, the President issued a decree for its promulgation and implementation. The Customs Import Tariff is divided into sixteen categories with six hundred and seventy-two items. Except for the agreed tariff rates limited by the Geneva Agreement passed by the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference and the reduction rates that our country has agreed to recognize, which will continue to be observed, and the tax rates on essential goods for economic construction and urgent necessities for people's livelihood, which will not be increased, the import tariff rates on all other luxury goods, non-essential goods for the general public, or goods that can be produced in large quantities domestically, and for the sake of protecting industry, will be increased separately according to their use, processing procedures, and relationship with domestic goods (whether they are competing products), with an average increase of one to three times the original tariff rate, with the highest reaching 200%. However, there are also some tariff items for which duty exemptions will be granted to encourage imports. The amended Customs Import Tariff is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Import Tariff of the Republic of China, Year 37</p>
<p>[Tax Collection Method for Mixtures] When liquids or other goods are imported in a mixed state, and the customs authorities have difficulty determining the value of their components, unless otherwise specified in the tariff, the entire mixture shall be taxed according to the highest tariff rate of the constituent substances.</p>
<p>[Notes for Categories I, II, III, IV] If piece goods or knitted fabrics contain multiple types of fibers, and the proportion of each fiber by weight does not exceed 5%, it will not affect the tariff classification.</p>
<p>If cotton, linen, ramie, hemp, jute, wool, or silk (mulberry silk or artificial silk) products are sewn, bordered, hemmed, or trimmed with other materials different from themselves, it will not affect the tariff classification.</p>
<p>For goods containing lace, ornaments, or other decorative materials, in addition to paying duty according to the tariff of the goods, an additional ad valorem tax of 10% shall be levied.</p>
<p>[Note for Category IV] The term "silk" in this tariff includes artificial silk. The term "artificial silk" includes artificial fibers other than artificial silk and other synthetic fibers for textile use.</p>
<p>Mixed yarn made of cotton or wool and more than 5% (by weight) of artificial silk (including artificial fibers and other synthetic fibers for textile use) shall be classified and taxed as artificial silk. If the weight of the artificial silk yarn (including artificial fibers and other synthetic fibers for textile use) is 5% or less, it shall be taxed as cotton yarn or wool yarn.</p>
<p>Blended yarn made of cotton or wool and 50% or more (by weight) of artificial wool yarn or matte artificial fiber or other synthetic matte fiber for textile use shall be classified and taxed as artificial wool yarn.

<h3>Budget Estimates of State-Owned Enterprises to Undergo Preliminary Review - Legislative Budget Committee Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee held a plenary committee meeting on the morning of the 2nd. Chairman Duanmu Jie decided to immediately begin reviewing the budget estimates of state-owned business entities in conjunction with the Finance and Monetary Committee and the Economic and Resources Committee. Nine committee members were selected, and letters were sent to the other two committees requesting each to nominate five to nine committee members to jointly conduct a preliminary review in three groups. One group is responsible for reviewing the budget estimates of institutions under the Ministry of Finance, such as banks. One group is responsible for reviewing the budget estimates of institutions under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, such as the China Textile Corporation. One group is responsible for reviewing the budget estimates of institutions under other departments, such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the China National Aviation Corporation. All other members of the three committees are free to participate. As for the review process, after the preliminary review, the order will remain comprehensive review (three groups jointly), joint review (three committees jointly), and plenary discussion. All will be conducted in secret, but the final stage of plenary discussion will have to wait until the second session of the Yuan begins in September.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Central Committee to Hold Symposium Today - Broadly Soliciting Opinions on Improving Party Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The Kuomintang Party Affairs Symposium will open on the 3rd. It is rumored that the President does not intend to attend and preside over it. The main purpose of the meeting is only to present opinions on party affairs, conduct a broad review, and the reform plan previously drafted by Hong Lanyou has been decided not to be submitted for discussion at the meeting. Other proposals, such as the "Opinions on Reforming the Party" drafted by Xu Xiaoyan and others and the "Draft Reform Measures" drafted by Li Tianmin and others, will be submitted for discussion at the meeting. If any specific contributions are made in the various opinions presented at the meeting, separate plans will be drafted, but no resolutions will be made at the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Hong Lanyou's party affairs improvement plan still needs to be passed by the Central Standing Committee, then submitted to the Director-General for review, and then handed over to the Plenary Session for discussion. According to Hong, the spirit of the plan is to seek the linkage of party affairs and politics, using political reform as the driving force for party affairs reform.</p>

If they have any opinions on party affairs, they can directly submit them to the Central Committee, and they do not need to attend this symposium.</p>
<h3>Suppression War Launched in Northern Jiangsu - Powerful Army Corps Moves South Along the Grand Canal Line - Situation Tense in Northern Anhui, Situation Unclear in Yingshang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] The National Army in Northern Jiangsu has begun to suppress the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. A powerful army corps is moving south along the Grand Canal line and its branches to launch a wide-ranging encirclement and suppression of the bandits who are roving in Northern Jiangsu. Also, the main forces of the 2nd, 11th, and 12th Columns of bandits who are harassing the Siyang and Suqian areas fled east and west separately on the 1st.</p>

<h3>Situation in Northeast Continues to Unfold - Land, Sea, and Air Forces Cooperating in Southern Liaoning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinzhou, 2nd] The situation in Southern Liaoning and Western Liaoning in the Northeast shows signs of continuing to unfold, especially in Southern Liaoning. Currently, land, sea, and air forces are cooperating in action. A strong army in Western Liaoning has arrived at a certain port and seems to be landing in Yingkou after the Bohai Fleet bombed Yingkou, adopting a posture of flanking with the National Army moving south from Shenyang to defeat the bandit army in Southern Liaoning. Western Liaoning is also making new deployments with new forces, and there are new actions. The air force is traveling between Liaoyang and Western Liaoning, conducting close reconnaissance and liaison work to restore the advantage of the Yingkou, Huludao, and Beining Railway line in the Northeast to break the difficult situation in the Northeast. Currently, in addition to intensifying the attack on Changchun with superior forces, the bandits on the east bank of the Daling River in Western Liaoning have also transferred a force from Northern Liaoning to concentrate in the Beizhen and Lvyangyi area, seemingly to contain and hinder the new actions of the National Army in Western Liaoning. Refugees and merchants traveling between Shenyang and Jinzhou are strictly prevented from crossing the Daling River by the bandits, who often shoot at those attempting to cross. Others are prevented from continuing west from Shenyang in Xinmin West to strictly seal off the area between Shenyang and Jinzhou. All of this indicates that the National Army is about to launch a proactive battle to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinzhou, 1st] The situation in Western Liaoning has developed in various aspects over the past month. Militarily, there will be a proactive attack recently. Industrially, after the resumption of work at the China Textile Corporation's Jinzhou Factory, it first opened 5,000 spindles, and now it has opened another 5,000 spindles. If the environment improves further, it can restore the highest target of 45,000 spindles last year. Railway transportation is normal. Food supplies are continuously recovering due to several good rains, and general prices are also falling, and the people have a slight smile on their faces. The military and local people have established a Cultural Promotion Association and a Cultural Hall, which are promoting the culture of Western Liaoning with Jinzhou as the core.</p>

<h3>Beijing Central Daily News Discusses New Economic Policy - Advocates Reorganizing Public and Private Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Amid the brewing of a new economic policy, the capital's Central Daily News published an article on the 2nd discussing the key to economic reform, titled "If One Step is Missed, All is Lost." The article first pointed out the necessity of reorganizing financial institutions at present, but said that if they are not reorganized, even if the fiscal system is reformed, the beneficiaries will still be a minority. The article further stated: Today, the interests of public and private financial institutions are diametrically opposed to the interests of the country and cannot coexist. If more than 6,000 public and private banks and firms are not reorganized, they will ruin the country's lifeline. Secondly, the article pointed out the fact that banks and firms absorb deposits at high interest rates and accused the state-owned banks of seeking profits, almost striving to seize the national treasury's issuance to hoard materials. If the government is determined to reorganize the 6,000 units of banks and firms into 2,000 units within a year, then whether or not the currency system is reformed, market stability can be expected.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Touchstone of Shanghai's Tycoons</h3>
<p>The deadline for soliciting donations for the relief special levy has been extended repeatedly, stipulated to be the end of July; however, of the 8.5 trillion yuan in the Shanghai area (including Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places), it is heard that less than a quarter has been raised to date. The President in Nanking mentioned this matter some time ago, and Mayor Wu also made some remarks at yesterday's Bandit Suppression and Espionage Elimination Propaganda Conference, hoping that Shanghai's tycoons can all be charitable, otherwise, the fundraising will be taken a step further to fulfill the mission. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Area Relief Special Levy Fundraising Committee held a meeting. Although the details of its resolution are not yet known as of this writing, we believe that the gentlemen in charge of fundraising will definitely give Shanghai's tycoons an excellent opportunity to donate generously. And the tycoons of Shanghai, thinking quietly at night, will certainly enthusiastically donate and display their spirit of "treating all people as siblings" and "feeling hungry when others are hungry" to do good.</p>
<p>We believe that although the deadline for the relief special levy has passed, the fundraising work should not be stopped immediately. Not only should it not be stopped, but it should be especially strengthened. In particular, those tycoons who possess wealth and can greatly help should see this relief special levy as a touchstone for their own conduct. Originally, relieving the poor and helping those in distress is everyone's duty, and human mutual assistance is inherent in human nature. Moreover, since tycoons have surplus capacity, at this time when refugees are everywhere and wounded soldiers fill the eyes, a single thought of compassion can naturally lead them to open their wallets and provide relief, without the need for us to say more. However, there are some short-sighted misers who often love money like their lives, truly "unwilling to pluck a single hair to benefit the world." Therefore, Jesus Christ once said, "It is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle." However, we imagine that the tycoons of Shanghai are probably not so foolish as to be so miserly.</p>
<p>In the world, "things will cry out when they are not balanced." Therefore, bandit suppression and espionage elimination cannot be solely blamed on the soldiers fighting desperately at the front, nor can we stand by and watch the refugees in the bandit areas and on the battlefields suffer the pain of displacement and wandering in ditches, and especially cannot let only those people sacrifice and suffer, while some of us who still have surplus capacity only indulge in extravagance and luxury, thinking that it is none of our business. The phenomenon of "vermilion gates reeking of wine and meat while the roads are littered with frozen corpses" will never be allowed to last long. When society has such a morbid state, it definitely needs the right medicine!</p>
<p>Today, if the tycoons of Shanghai take a broader view, they will certainly think that having wealth but not being able to distribute it, and distributing wealth but not using it well, is not good for the public or private, for the country or for themselves. Moreover, after reading the Chinese Communist Party's announcement supporting the Comintern Information Bureau's resolution condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party, we can more clearly recognize the true attitude of the Chinese Communists towards the general property owners (whether they are big capitalists or petty bourgeoisie) is absolute liquidation, without leaving the slightest leeway. Then, we should know that the government's bandit suppression and the society's espionage elimination are not only to protect the country's independence and the nation's survival, but in fact, the most protected beneficiaries are the wealthy people with assets. Understanding this point, why not take advantage of the fact that the National Army is actively suppressing and the Communist bandits are struggling, quickly do what is possible, generously donate to relieve refugees, relieve wounded soldiers, and relieve the poor and helpless people, alleviate the government's worries, seek treatment for society, contribute to the country in a big way, and create blessings for future generations in a small way. Do they really have to wait until they are at the end of their rope and the Communist bandits' knives are on their heads before they donate money? Remember two years ago, Speaker Pan said, "Shanghai is the most luxurious and extravagant city in the country, but why did it suffer less damage during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War than other places? The reason may be due to the charitable acts of disaster relief and neighborly assistance in the past few decades, with Shanghai's donations being second to none. The so-called city of accumulated good deeds must have surplus blessings, and this is still due to the legacy of the elders who were happy to do good." Although these words seem to be about cause and effect, they may still be able to encourage the general tycoons of Shanghai today. We believe that they will certainly continue the achievements of their predecessors, carry them forward, and make efforts for the country and create blessings for the society again.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to advise the wealthy gentlemen of Shanghai: why not first inquire about the people who used to live comfortable lives in the bandit areas, and how are they now? We know that in many places, once they have fallen, they deeply regret not having donated earlier to make the National Army well-fed and well-mounted to defend against the Communist bandits outside their homeland. Now, Shanghai is still a relatively stable place, and if the people of Shanghai do not contribute money now, they may regret it too late! And we also want to tell the mayor and the members of the fundraising committee: they should quickly, based on the reports from various parties, release a list of the gentlemen in Shanghai who are relatively wealthy but still not donating, so that everyone can comment on them and see who is "worthy of donation by all the people," so as to mobilize the power of the society to persuade these tycoons to donate money one by one, to relieve suffering and difficulties, to save the country and save themselves!</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Truth of the July 5th Incident, Qin Dechun Arrives in Beiping by Plane, Will Collect Impartial Data from Various Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Qin Dechun arrived in Beiping by plane from Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. today. When meeting with reporters, he said: He is only responsible for investigating the July 5th Incident and has no power to handle it. He will collect impartial data from various parties and report to President Weng to seek a reasonable solution. He hopes to leave a good example for the protection of human rights. Qin recalled his attitude towards student anti-Japanese demonstrations during his tenure as mayor of Beiping in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, saying: "The police were not allowed to carry guns, and the police were not allowed to carry batons. Police who beat students would be punished, and those who were beaten by students would be rewarded." Finally, when the students were about to rush into the Japanese embassy, he allowed them to be sprayed with water cannons, allowing a few people to go forward and make them dodge. Qin also recalled the scene of his previous visit to Beiping to participate in the work of the Beiping Mediation Department, saying that he was overwhelmed with feelings about the past and present. Qin will meet with Fu Zuoyi on the 3rd and plans to stay in Beiping for a week. Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui are scheduled to arrive in Beiping on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Fu Zuoyi entered the city at dusk on the 2nd to visit Qin Dechun and discuss ways to resolve the July 5th Incident.</p>

<h3>Difficulty in Anti-Smuggling on the Border Between China and Hong Kong, Has Become a Paradise for Smugglers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] According to Hong Kong news: Recently, because the border checkpoints between China and Hong Kong have been repeatedly attacked by bandits, anti-smuggling work has become very difficult. After the Ma Shi Wan checkpoint was forced to retreat, the surrounding area has become a paradise for smugglers. In order to remedy this major loss, Kowloon Customs Commissioner Gorges will go to Shanghai in the short term to discuss remedial measures with the general customs. According to Ma Shi Wan, which is Hong Kong's territorial sea, we cannot send ships to patrol and arrest along the coast before the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, and most of the coastline is occupied by corrupt merchants, making arrests difficult. Therefore, unless the Sino-Hong Kong agreement can be implemented immediately, smuggling will never be eradicated.</p>

<h3>Shi Zhifan Highly Suspected in the Rice Robbery Case in Suzhou Last Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 2nd] When rice riots occurred in Suzhou last month, the Suzhou Garrison Headquarters sent Zhang Xiong, a staff officer of the headquarters, to be responsible for investigating the truth.

<h3>Three Envoys Request Meeting with Stalin Awaiting Official Soviet Response Lifting of Berlin Blockade Must Precede Four-Power Talks</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 2nd] The representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are currently awaiting Stalin's response regarding their request to meet with him to discuss the German problem. It is generally anticipated that Stalin's reply may be presented today. If he agrees, the meeting will be held immediately or within a few days. Sources close to the Western diplomatic representatives state that they will present Stalin with a simple two-point proposal, decided upon during the London discussions. This proposal requests the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade, after which the four powers will consult on the entire Berlin situation. This consultation may take the form of a meeting of foreign ministers. If Stalin refuses to meet with the Western envoys, they will present this proposal to Molotov.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 1st, United Press International] Well-informed sources say that Western diplomats have requested a meeting with Stalin, hoping to implore him personally to lift the blockade of Berlin and agree to a formal four-power conference on the entire German problem. An official at the French Embassy in the Soviet Union confirmed that the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have requested direct access to Stalin, and Molotov is considering the matter. It is understood that the Western nations will suggest a news blackout when they begin discussions with Stalin or Molotov; therefore, there will be no news to report unless Moscow, Paris, London, and Washington simultaneously announce the progress of the negotiations. Bevin's private secretary, Roberts, had dinner at the American Embassy with American Ambassador Smith. Experts from the British, French, and American embassies held meetings to discuss reports to be sent to their respective governments.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 1st] The early return of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Moscow to meet with the three Western envoys has created a good impression here, with many believing it is an auspicious sign. According to The Sunday Times today, Bevin remained in London over the weekend to study reports from the Moscow talks. The talks may produce the following results: The four-power Berlin Control Commission may reconvene to resolve the currency dispute. If this succeeds, Stalin, Truman, Attlee, and French Prime Minister Marie will negotiate directly. The newspaper also stated that such negotiations between the four-power leaders would not be trapped in an abyss of doubt and fear and would therefore have a better chance of achieving some results.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Vyshinsky Proposes Draft of Danube River Convention Proposes New Committee with No Permanent Speaking Rights for the US</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] Moscow Radio reported that the Danube countries have defeated the Western countries. On the first day of the conference, the Western countries attempted to impose their conditions on the Danube countries.

<p>[US Information Service, New York, 2nd] A special weekly program on the "Voice of America" broadcasts to China, featuring speeches by Chinese guests. In Shanghai, you can tune in on Saturdays from 8:50 PM to 9:00 PM. This Saturday (the 7th), the speaker will be Mao Shuqing, who will speak on "Europe As I Saw It." Mr. Mao is the special correspondent for the Shen Bao in the United States. Near the end of the last war, he entered Berlin with other special correspondents alongside the Allied forces. He was the first Chinese person to be liberated in Europe and had ample opportunity to witness the worst destruction of the war in France, Belgium, Poland, Denmark, and other countries. Recently, Mr. Mao revisited Europe and returned to his old haunts. In his broadcast, he will compare the current situation in Europe with the situation at the end of the war. Mr. Mao said that Europe has made economic progress, but the political situation has become volatile. He said that he believes a third force, namely socialism, between totalitarianism and capitalism, will create a link between East and West. He said, "I think Europe is at least somewhat unified in appearance." During his most recent visit, he discovered that "all coalition governments have collapsed." He said that in the Eastern European countries he traveled to, he did not see any political freedom, and the people were far behind Western European countries in basic industries. Mr. Mao said that he found a lot of progress in Germany, but the German people still live a difficult life. He also said, "I believe that including Germany in the Marshall Plan is a reasonable move, because if Germany is unstable, there can be no true peace in Europe."</p>

<h3>Truman to Return to Washington After Voting in Hometown Primary; Republicans Still Plan to Adjourn Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Independence, Missouri, August 2] Aides to President Truman said on the 2nd that if Congress adjourns without taking any action, Truman does not plan to call another special session of Congress. The President is currently resting at his home here, in order to participate in the Democratic primary vote on the 3rd. After voting, he will hasten to return to Washington. Republican leaders have decided to refuse to grant special powers to the President, and plan for Congress to adjourn immediately. If they take no action on the price control and housing shortage bills, it seems the President intends to let the people of the country decide for themselves.</p>

<h3>New Utility Prices Announced, Highest Increase Over Threefold; Public Transportation Fares Effective from 5th</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The new utility prices for August were reviewed and decided yesterday by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, after convening relevant parties, and approved by Mayor Wu.

<p>Ferry</p>
<p>Across the river 120,000 yuan Long distance (per person nautical mile) 85,000 yuan Increase of 242%</p>
<p>During yesterday's review meeting, representatives from various utility companies stated that the increase in various relevant cost factors was too large, and requested a very high adjustment rate. They unanimously insisted that the adjustment standard must balance cash receipts and expenditures. However, because the funds needed to purchase oil and coal have been approved by the Public Utilities Bureau for lending by the National Bank, and the Exchange Control Board and the Fuel Management Committee have agreed to the principle of one-time exchange settlement, this will reduce the costs of various public utilities, so the Public Utilities Bureau strongly suppressed the adjustment rate for this month. It is said that the meeting lasted for six or seven hours of contention.</p>
<h3>New Director of Gold Control Bureau Takes Office, Promising Impartiality and No Favoritism; Explains Attitude in Implementing Policies</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Lin Chongyong, the newly appointed Director of the Gold Control Bureau of this city, took office at the bureau at 9 a.m. yesterday. President Yu of the Central Bank and people from all walks of life came to congratulate him. At 5 p.m., Mr. Lin held a reception for reporters, explaining his basic attitude in implementing control policies in the future, stating briefly: The Gold Control Bureau was established seven months ago, and under the leadership of Director Li, a good foundation has already been established, and its style is rarely criticized. In addition to following established procedures, I will implement control orders with an attitude of impartiality and no favoritism. I believe that the current control laws and regulations have no loopholes in their methods. As for the importance and urgency of implementation, they will be adapted to the circumstances and have a sense of proportion. The basic principles of managing banks in the future will be to fully comply with the Banking Law and strengthen the basic spirit of the Financial Control Regulations, such as Articles 17, 32, 33, and 43 of the Banking Law, which aim to prohibit banks from engaging in commercial speculation, misusing bank funds, and creating false accounts. If these can be effectively implemented, there is no need for other supplementary laws, and the actual effect of management can be achieved.</p>
<p>Bank Operations Not on the Right Track</p>
<p>The current development of the financial industry in our country is extremely distorted. The number of banks is rare in all countries in the world, and the abuse of credit is also unprecedented in any period. There are some banks in this city whose expenditures are even greater than the total amount of deposits, and they have been able to maintain themselves in the past. This also shows that the income from their use of deposits is greater than their expenditures. The fact that their operations are not on the right track can be seen from this. This type of abnormal situation can indicate the severity of the economic situation. If we allow it to continue to deteriorate, not only will these unhealthy banks not be able to survive, but even healthy ones will perish together.</p>
<p>Definitely Will Not Harm Legitimate Banks</p>
<p>The Gold Control Bureau's attitude towards banks will be to distinguish between right and wrong, promote good and eliminate evil. Currently, among the banks in this city, the difference between good and bad is immeasurable. When implementing controls, banks with sound operations will be given appropriate protection, and the operations of legitimate banks will definitely not be harmed. Bad banks will be treated with absolutely no leniency and will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Speculative Venues All Have Leads</p>
<p>Director Lin finally stated again: The government is determined to crack down on speculation and hoarding. All possible speculative venues have leads, and by following these clues, criminals will surely be caught. Before taking office, I met with the highest authorities and stated that the success or failure of financial control depends not only on the efforts of the Gold Control Bureau, but also on the attitude of the government. Financial control aims to stabilize prices and is actually intended for the livelihood of all ordinary people, so it should receive the greatest support from all parties. In particular, it is hoped that guidance and cooperation can be obtained from the media. As for the inspection of banks, this is a regular system in foreign countries. Our country is currently in economic chaos, so it is even more necessary. [Reported by this newspaper] Two postal ships of the American President Lines will arrive in Shanghai one after another this afternoon; one is the General Gordon, which is coming from Hong Kong via Little Luzon, arriving at the port at 11 a.m. today and departing from Shanghai at 12 noon tomorrow via Yokohama to return to the United States. Also, the postal ship Cleveland, which is coming to Shanghai from San Francisco via Honolulu and Yokohama, arrived at the port at 10 a.m. this morning, berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf, and will set sail at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and then return to San Francisco via Honolulu.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Urgently Wants to Raise Prices; Appeals to Ministry of Transportation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The matter of adjusting passenger and freight rates in the shipping industry was originally scheduled to be implemented starting yesterday (the 2nd), but the Ministry of Transportation has not yet issued an approval. The Shipping Association convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, and as a result, urgently telegraphed the Ministry again, because prices have soared crazily again recently, requesting consideration of the difficulties of shipping merchants and prompt approval. It is also heard that the shipping industry plans to implement the price increase tomorrow, increasing freight rates by 120% and ticket prices by 60%, but whether it can be implemented as scheduled tomorrow will still depend on the orders of the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Orders New Aircraft; Difficult to Transport for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Several senior personnel from the China National Aviation Corporation who were sent to the United States for investigation and training have returned to China yesterday. The six Convair twin-engine passenger planes ordered by the company from the Convair Aircraft Factory have not yet been delivered, because the new passenger planes have very good performance. Each engine has 2,400 horsepower, and the speed per hour reaches 300 miles, and the take off and landing does not necessarily require a large-scale airport. Therefore, the domestic demand for this fast passenger plane in the United States is also very urgent. The Convair factory has a backlog of orders, and the China National Aviation Corporation's orders will only be able to be transported to China after several months.</p>
<h3>Taikoo's Jintang Ship, Seized by Japan, Returned from Japan and Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Jintang, a regular liner of Taikoo Company's Yichang-Chongqing route on the Yangtze River, retreated to Shanghai and anchored on the Huangpu River when the Sino-Japanese War broke out and the Yangtze River was blockaded. Later, it was seized by the Japanese army and towed to Japan for repairs, and renamed Asahi Azuma Maru. After the victory, the company learned about the situation and immediately requested negotiations from the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan. It has now been verified and returned, and arrived in Shanghai on Saturday evening last week, berthing at the Taikoo Pudong Wharf. The ship is still being driven by Japanese for this trip, with a crew of 29 people. The Allied Headquarters sent two American soldiers to escort it to Shanghai. The company will take over in the next few days, and the Japanese crew members will be repatriated to their country. The ship has a gross tonnage of 435 tons and a net tonnage of 221 tons. Because it sails on the Sichuan River, its horsepower is strong, totaling 1,700 horsepower. After being seized and repaired by the Japanese army, it has been completely renewed.</p>
<h3>Mass Rally for Suppression of Rebellion and Elimination of Traitors; Speaker Calls on the Wealthy to Contribute Wealth and Jointly Face National Crisis</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Mass Rally for Suppression of Rebellion and Elimination of Traitors was held enthusiastically at the Cultural Hall on Zhabu Road at 8 a.m. yesterday. More than a thousand representatives from municipal military and political organizations and other social groups attended, with Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Director Fang Zhi of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, Director Jin Longzhang of the Democratic Socialist Party Municipal Party Headquarters, and Chairman Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union serving as the presidium. First, General Chairman Pan delivered the opening speech, stating briefly: "We are holding this mass rally for suppression of rebellion and elimination of traitors today, and representatives from various groups are enthusiastically participating, which is enough to represent the wishes of all citizens. Regarding the work of suppressing rebellion and eliminating traitors, we must strengthen our understanding of the current serious situation. (1) In the three years since victory, our country has failed to actively engage in production and construction, which has affected our low international status, all caused by the</p>
<p>Communist bandits' internal strife.</p>
<p>These national scum, in order to realize their ambitions, do not hesitate to undermine consultations and drive the people of the whole country to wander in the ditches of poverty, hunger, and death, in order to make China a war base for the Third International. After the conspiracy of the Communist bandits was exposed, the government could no longer tolerate it and issued a general mobilization order to suppress the rebellion, expressing its position and determination. Recently, President Weng's "Letter to the People of the Country" clearly reiterated national policy and swept away the rumors of "peace talks." In the future, the people of the country must distinguish between right and wrong and realize the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country with the spirit of jointly facing national crisis. (2) What the Communist bandits have done is treason and not patriotism. The government's</p>
<p>campaign is suppression of rebellion and not civil war. We must recognize this point. The current campaign to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion is a war to maintain national independence and unity. The people of the whole country must contribute their greatest strength to support the soldiers fighting on the front lines. We believe that with the full support of the people of Shanghai for the government's work of suppressing the rebellion, it will be completed quickly. We also hope that under the principle of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength," the wealthy and powerful will fully contribute their financial resources to meet urgent needs and jointly face national crisis. (3) Among the subordinates of the traitorous bandits, there are many who have been coerced into following them. It is hoped that these people will discover their conscience and repent in time. We believe that the government, under the major premise of the country and the nation, will definitely not hold them accountable for the past, allow them to rehabilitate themselves, and seek the realization of peaceful unification as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Mayor Points Out Three Points</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Wu delivered a speech. After explaining that the Central Committee of the Communist bandits responded to the international communist condemnation of Yugoslavia's proclamation, he pointed out three points: (1) Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia was condemned for patriotism, and the Communist bandits openly responded to the Communist International's proclamation, which shows that they have no concept of the country and the nation, and it is obvious that they have confessed their crimes. (2) In the Communist International's proclamation, the "private ownership of land" system in South Korea was severely criticized. According to this, it can be seen that the Communist bandits' propaganda of "land to the tiller" is just a facade to deceive the world. (3) Yugoslavia was condemned on the grounds of the "People's Front," while the Communist bandits and their supporters are propagating themselves with the slogan "Democratic Front." How can they justify themselves?</p>
<p>Fang Zhi Suggests Sanctioning the Unjust</p>
<p>After that, Democratic Socialist Party Chief Jin Longzhang explained the meaning and necessity of suppressing rebellion and eliminating traitors. Kuomintang Chief Fang immediately put forward three suggestions: (1) Intensify efforts to contribute money and effort to eliminate the Communist bandits who are willing to sell out the country and the nation. (2) Awaken the deceived to repent and return. (3) Mobilize social forces to sanction those who are rich but unkind. These suggestions were enthusiastically applauded by the whole body and immediately telegraphed to the whole country in the name of the conference to unanimously respond. The propaganda conference ended at about 10 a.m., and immediately screened a film to entertain the attending representatives. After the meeting, the Suppression and Traitor Elimination Corps decided to form twelve sub-corps immediately and go to various districts of the city to start propaganda work.</p>
<h3>Handkerchief Industry Workers Resume Work</h3>
<p>Sewing Industry Pays Wages According to the Index for the Current Month</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The workers in the city's handkerchief industry, who went on strike due to the index issue, have all resumed work yesterday. It has now been decided that the wages for July will be temporarily borrowed at 1.3 million times for the first half of the month, and will be calculated and paid according to the average of the upper and lower index for the current month for the second half of the month. The wages for August are awaiting mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. The wage index for workers in the machine-made sewing industry in this city was originally calculated one month late. Now, after mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs, it has been changed to be calculated according to the index for the current month.</p>
<h3>Visiting a Dance Hall Leads to Disaster; Two People Stabbed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Ye Wenming, a clerk at the Central Printing Plant, and Zhang Wenji, a worker, are both from Guangdong. The night before last, they went to the Jinshan Dance Hall together. When they were dancing, they had an argument with a certain dancer and agreed to come back the next night to settle the matter. At about 7:40 p.m. last night, Ye and Zhang went to the Jinshan Dance Hall. Just as they arrived at the entrance of the Jinshan Dance Hall, they were suddenly surrounded by more than ten people lying in ambush, who took out sharp blades and stabbed Zhang in the head, hands, and feet five times, and Ye Wenming in the back and shoulders twice. The perpetrators fled in a crowd. Afterwards, the two victims were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by police car.</p>

<h3>Diamond Hidden in Toe Crevice: Sharp-Eyed Customs Officer Foils Smuggling Attempt</h3>
<p>On August 1st, China Aviation Corporation's flight number 104 from Hong Kong landed in Shanghai. Customs inspectors discovered a diamond hidden within the toe crevice of a passenger surnamed Ye. The inspection process was quite intriguing. Details are as follows: After the plane arrived at the airport, customs officers completed their inspection of all passengers' luggage. Passengers hurried to leave, but one passenger surnamed Ye remained unusually calm, walking slowly and lagging behind, attempting to conceal his smuggling activities. Ironically, this aroused the suspicion of customs officers, who ordered him to stop for a full body search, but found nothing. They then asked him to remove his leather shoes. After careful inspection of the shoes, they found nothing hidden inside. They then asked him to remove his socks and suddenly discovered a rubber bandage-like wrapping around his big toe crevice. They asked Ye whether the rubber bandage was for a wound. Ye immediately appeared flustered. After removing the rubber bandage, they discovered a diamond stuck to it. After confiscating the diamond, customs officers sealed it in an envelope, had the owner sign it for verification, and then took it back to customs for confiscation.</p>
<h3>City's Financial Balance Difficult to View Optimistically: July Shortfall Exceeds 100 Billion; Bureau Chief Engages in Tax Revenue Overhaul</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's preliminary statistics on municipal fiscal revenue and expenditure for July show a total revenue of over 1.5 trillion yuan, more than double that of the previous month. Expenditures for various departments, including operating expenses and the 420,000-fold employee living subsidy advanced for July, totaled over 1.17 trillion yuan. According to central government regulations, the living subsidy for municipal government employees in Shanghai for July is 1.6 million times, and in addition to the 420,000 times already issued, an additional 1.18 million times must be supplemented, requiring more than 1.86 trillion yuan in living subsidies. Director Tian twice went to Beijing to request a central government subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan, as well as the 300 billion yuan shortfall in July's revenue and expenditure, still leaving a shortfall of over 110 billion yuan. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter visited Director Tian Yongqian of the Finance Bureau to inquire about the fiscal situation this month. According to him, the profit and loss situation will only become clear in mid-month, as the tax revenue situation will then be roughly known. However, the cost of living index for government employees has risen significantly this month, making it difficult to be optimistic about balancing revenue and expenditure. The authorities are currently engaged in an overhaul of tax revenue. The Finance Bureau has solicited reform opinions from its subordinate tax collection agencies, hoping to gather them all next week to discuss specific tax revenue reform measures.</p>

<h3>Two Defendants in Rice Ration Embezzlement Case: Found Guilty of Other Crimes and Sentenced</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Yizhong, leader of the Yong'an Rice Store's subsidized rice sales team, colluded with rice merchants Dai Yuanbi, Zang Fuyuan, Cai Zong, and Gu Baosong to engage in embezzlement. They were tried in local court yesterday. On May 29th of last year, the Yong'an Rice Store was entrusted by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to distribute rice to city residents.

Zhu Zhaomei, Shen Changfa, Ji Yimin, and three others reported them. During the trial in local court yesterday, Judge Wu Shaobai also discovered that Dai Yuanbi and Gu Baosong had been previously convicted of other crimes and sentenced to seven years in prison.

<h3>Huangxing and Tongan Vessels in Anqing Send SOS</h3>
<p>Anchor Chain Causes Trouble, Rescue Ship Dispatched</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huangxing vessel, carrying salt from Qingdao to Anhui, arrived in Anqing on the 28th of last month. Due to a lack of space at the dock, it anchored on the opposite bank. The Tongan Company's Tongan vessel arrived in Anqing from Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 1st) and anchored in front of the Huangxing vessel. At that time, the river current was very swift, and the vessel was forced to retreat. Unexpectedly, the Tongan vessel's propeller entangled the Huangxing vessel's anchor chain. Upon seeing this, the Huangxing vessel's crew immediately cut the anchor chain and abandoned the anchor. It has now docked to unload cargo. However, the Tongan vessel's propeller is entangled in the anchor chain and cannot move. Both vessels sent telegrams yesterday requesting help. The Tongan Company requested that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatch a vessel to rescue them. The company decided to dispatch the Jian'an vessel this morning to Anqing for rescue.</p>
<h3>Renmin Bazaar Disconnected from Electricity; Zhang Zhongyuan Cables Request for Negotiation</h3>

<h3>After Agreement on Wage Payment Method: China Silk Factory Number Two Suddenly Goes on Strike</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The wages for workers at the city's state-run China Silk Company's First and Second Factories were previously paid on the 15th of each month and at the end of the month. However, after the authorities stipulated that the price index be announced twice a month, the company decided to change the wage payment schedule to the 20th of each month and the 5th of the following month, as calculating wages takes time. According to the methods stipulated by the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau, this was feasible. However, the labor union insisted that wages be paid two days earlier (i.e., the 3rd and 18th of each month) and that part of the wages be borrowed in the two periods of the 15th and 30th, and then deducted when wages were paid. After negotiations between labor and management, the following two points were decided: (1) The wages for the first half of each month will be paid in full on the 18th, based on the price index for the previous period of this month. (2) The wages for the second half of each month will be paid in full on the 4th of the following month, based on the price index for the next period of this month. After the method was agreed upon, the workers at the First Factory continued to work as usual, and their morale was quite good. However, the workers at the Second Factory suddenly went on strike yesterday morning. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday sternly ordered the chairman of the Second Factory's labor union to persuade the workers to resume work by this morning.</p>

<h3>Bogus Money Used to Defraud; Scheme Exposed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 4:00 PM yesterday, two customers, Cui Xinqi and Liu Xiaoquan, suddenly arrived at Bao Chengxiang Cotton Fabric Store at 20 Zizhong Road. They selected 20 bolts of cotton fabric, totaling 1.43 billion yuan in legal tender. They instructed the store clerk to deliver it to a room in the Xinli Hotel on South Xizang Road. The store owner, Kang Binjia, ordered his associate Xu Weimin to load the goods onto a vehicle and deliver them. After arriving, Cui ordered Liu to take care of the cotton fabric while he counted out a large sum of cash. After Xu carefully counted each bill, he discovered that the outer few bills were indeed legal tender, but the rest were all ghost money. Seeing that his scheme had been exposed, Cui turned to flee, but was stopped by Xu, who called the police. The police from the Songshan Police Station arrested him. After checking, only 43.7 million yuan in legal tender was found. The rest was all counterfeit money, it was said.</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Nanshi Lasting Three Hours: Hundreds of Shanties Destroyed; Four from Culprit Clothing Store Detained for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shanties densely packed together in the area in front of the Hunan Guild Hall at the intersection of Huminnan Road and Xietu Road in Nanshi, totaling over 400, were mostly inhabited by laborers from northern Jiangsu. At around 0:15 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the clothing store opened by Xu Chenglong, a native of northern Jiangsu, at 371 Lunan Road due to careless cooking of lunch. At that time, the weather was extremely hot, and the scorching sun was raging. Once the thatched sheds caught fire, black smoke billowed into the sky, and the flames were dazzling. In an instant, the fire spread to the neighboring Senji Tobacco and Paper Store at 369 and the Meili Barber Shop at 373. Before long, over a hundred shanties in the alley at 365 were reduced to ashes. Subsequently, the fire spread to the north side of the road, and over two hundred thatched sheds built in front of the Hunan Guild Hall were also completely burned to the ground. Fortunately, firefighters and police removed the thatched sheds attached to the base of the Hunan Guild Hall's wall; otherwise, the situation would have been even more dire. After the fire broke out, the Nanshi District Fire Brigades were the first to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Then, the Xin Kaihe Gaoshan Road Fire Zone and other teams also arrived at the scene with fire trucks. The fire was brought under control at 2:50 PM, but the embers were not completely extinguished until 3:30 PM. Hundreds of men and women affected by the disaster gathered by the roadside, their wives weeping and their children crying, in a most miserable state. The fire starter, Xu Chenglong, and three others were later detained by the Penglai Police Station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Special Relief Donation Campaign Intensified: Du Yuesheng Donates 100 Billion as Example; Wealthy Tightwads to be Sanctioned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Special Relief Donation Solicitation Committee held a meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu, who also serves as the committee chairman, presided over the meeting. Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiyu, Cheng Cangbo, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Zhi, Wu Yunchu, Shui Xiangyun, Shu Yuzhang, and more than a dozen others attended. During the meeting, it was decided that the object of continued solicitation would be wealthy individuals, and the amount of money already raised would not be made public for the time being. It is hoped that the target of over 8.5 trillion yuan can be exceeded. Currently, the Hangzhou branch in another city has pledged to donate 30 billion, and Wuxi has remitted over 8 billion. Other branches are actively urging donations. The Solicitation Committee expressed optimism about the future of the special donation campaign. However, it may take coercive action against wealthy individuals who deliberately delay donations. If necessary, it will take decisive measures, such as having the government investigate their property and temporarily hold it in custody until the donation is made. At the same time, their names will be published and subjected to public censure. Committee member Du Yuesheng immediately pledged to donate 100 billion yuan at yesterday's meeting as an example.</p>

<h3>Former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army to China, Japanese War Criminal Okamura Neiji, Indicted by Military Court; Accused of Conniving with Subordinates to Massacre Civilians During His Tenure</h3>
<p>War criminal Okamura Neiji was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army to China in November of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944). All Japanese army combat troops in China were under his command and supervision. After the victory, he represented the Japanese government in handling matters such as surrender to China and the repatriation of prisoners of war. After the work was completed, the suspect suffered from severe tuberculosis. After receiving treatment and recovering slightly, he was handed over by the Ministry of National Defense to the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals for trial. He was recently escorted to Shanghai and is temporarily residing in a hospital for treatment. After a thorough investigation by Prosecutor Shi Yong of the court, it was determined that he was suspected of conniving with his subordinates to massacre civilians during his tenure. Therefore, he was indicted. The full text of the indictment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Defendant Okamura Neiji, male, 65 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army to China, Army General.</p>
<p>The aforementioned defendant's war crime case (Case No. 145 of the 37th year of the Republic of China) has been investigated and concluded, and it is determined that prosecution is warranted. The facts of the crime, evidence, and relevant legal provisions are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Facts</p>
<p>Defendant Okamura Neiji, from Tokyo, Japan, graduated from the Japanese Army Academy and the Army University. He successively served as the Chief of the Military Investigation Committee, a Major General; the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army; the Second Chief of the General Staff Headquarters; the Commander of the Second Division, a Lieutenant General; the Commander of the 11th Army; and the Commander of the 6th Area Army, an Army General. During the Sino-Japanese War, on November 26, 1944, the defendant was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, and all land combat troops in China were under the command and supervision of the defendant. During his tenure, his subordinates frequently committed atrocities against our civilians, including killing, looting, and destruction of property. Cases that were serious and have been adjudicated include: (1) Ochiai Jin'nouro, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 27th Division, led his troops into Jiangxi Province in January 1945, disrupting Lianhua, Yongxin, Suichuan, Taihe, and other counties, killing 89 of our civilians, including Zhou Haoping, Feng Wangshi, and Wang Zhanming, and burning down 65 houses. (2) Kitanohara Shiro, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 116th Division, was stationed in Shaoyang, Hunan, from April to July 1945, and continuously massacred 110 civilians, including Fan Yuechi. (3) Oka Hisao, Major General and Commander of the 55th Brigade of the 64th Division, was stationed in Yongjia and Yueqing, Zhejiang. From January 1945 until the Japanese surrender, the brigade continuously robbed 84 businesses, including Zhang Dexun, Zhang Yaokun, Zhao Dianxiang, Xu Hongfang, and Yuanshengxiang Cloth Store, and set fire to dozens of houses and furniture and clothing belonging to Huang Xiuchang and ten other families. (4) Funabiki Masayuki, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Changsha Area Gendarmerie, was stationed in Changsha, Yuanjiang, and Xiangyin. From February to April 1945, the unit continuously killed 22 civilians, including Li Fuxian and Yang Zhengbao. (5) Tanaka Hisaichi, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 23rd Army, set fire to all the houses in Liuzhou when he withdrew his troops in 1945, causing an unprecedented catastrophe. After the end of the war, Okamura Neiji was turned over by the Ministry of National Defense to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>(2) Evidence and Legal Provisions</p>
<p>According to Article 46 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, belligerents should respect the lives and private property of the people in occupied territories. In this case, the atrocities committed by the defendant's subordinates during combat operations or in garrison areas while he was Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army are well-documented. (Omission) The defendant held supreme military power and, with respect to the massacres, robberies, and destruction of property perpetrated by his subordinate troops, neither took preventative measures beforehand nor promptly stopped them afterward. According to Article 9 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, he should be held jointly liable. Although he claimed that he always had strict military discipline and that he had severely prohibited any illegal behavior by his troops, these were nothing more than empty words and sophistry intended to evade criminal responsibility. He connived with his subordinates to continuously massacre civilians, loot, and wantonly destroy property during combat operations, thereby violating Articles 46 and 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and committing crimes under Article 2, Section 2, Article 3, Section 1, and Articles 24 and 27 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations. Therefore, he is prosecuted in accordance with Article 26 of the same regulations.</p>

<p>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>Refused to Return the Property after Negotiating a Two-Year Extension After the Expiration of the Contract, Intending to Seize the Property</h3>
<p>Reader Zhou Xiangfa asks: I have a house that was mortgaged to Ding in 1912, who then sub-mortgaged it to Chen. In 1935, I renewed the mortgage contract with Chen for a term of ten years. After the term expired in 1945, I intended to redeem the property for my own use, but Chen claimed that he had to wait for his nephew to return from Chongqing to handle the matter, and requested a two-year extension. Unexpectedly, when I went to redeem the property last year, he said that the deadline had passed and my right to redeem the property had expired. I would like to ask: (1) Is Chen's behavior illegal, and can I sue him for fraud? (2) If I can redeem the property, how many times the original price will be required?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers:] (1) If a mortgage has a fixed term, and after the term expires, the mortgagor requests a two-year extension from the mortgagee, there should be written proof, otherwise, if the property is not redeemed at the original mortgage price after two years, the mortgagee obtains ownership of the property. If you have no basis to claim back the property through legal means, it will be difficult to win the case, as there are no clear provisions in the law.</p>
<h3>Postal Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>We have received inquiries from the following readers of this newspaper: (1) Mr. Dong Dejia, (2) Mr. Tao Lixing, (3) Mr. Hu. We hereby answer the questions raised as follows:</p>
<p>Answer: (1) (A) All postal items deposited in the mailbox of the Shaanxi North Road branch office are opened and dispatched by the office on time, without delay or loss. Regarding the undelivered or unreturned letters you sent, please provide specific details for thorough investigation. (B) In the future, when inquiring about postal items, if you encounter the same situation, please inform the relevant postmaster for handling. (C) The postal agency at the intersection of Chengdu North Road and Siyang Road was repeatedly warned about raising the selling price of stamps but did not correct the behavior. This bureau has revoked its authorization and is seeking other merchants to take over.</p>
<p>(2) (A) An airmail letter from Shanghai to Chengde takes about four to five days to arrive. (B) The question is unclear. Please provide more details for investigation and reply.</p>
<p>(3) A telegraphic money order from the Xi'an Post Office takes 24 hours from the time it is sent by the telegraph office to the time it is received by this bureau, which is the normal situation. If there are disruptions in the electrical current or errors in the code words, it will take longer due to the need for repeated inquiries.</p>
<p>[Additional Note] Readers submitting letters should provide a detailed address for direct reply.</p>

<h3>The Import Control Committee Has Begun Accepting Applications for Importing Foreign Capital. Whether Hong Kong and Macau Are Applicable Is Still Under Negotiation.</h3>
<p>Regarding the "Regulations for the Import of Overseas Chinese Capital and Foreign Capital," Huo Baoshu of the Import Control Committee stated yesterday that the committee has begun accepting applications from all parties. According to Mr. Huo, although the detailed implementation rules are still being discussed by the Executive Yuan, in order to accelerate the import of these materials, the committee has decided to accept applications from all parties first. If there are any questions, the committee can provide detailed explanations. Mr. Huo also stated that whether Hong Kong and Macau should be classified as foreign countries, i.e., whether the regulations are applicable to them, is currently being discussed with the Federation of Industries and other parties to seek their opinions.</p>
<p>Zhang Yaozhang, Secretary-General of the Importers and Exporters Association, said that it is unreasonable to treat Hong Kong and Macau's capital as special. Although Hong Kong and Macau are adjacent to the mainland, the import of goods can easily cause fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and encourage speculation, but if restrictions are added, the funds may still be remitted to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, and still be imported as overseas Chinese capital. Therefore, the crux of the problem lies in comprehensive and strict management, rather than making Hong Kong and Macau special.</p>
<h3>The Market Is in a State of Confusion, with Chinese Stocks Rising and Falling Sharply</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks rose and fell sharply yesterday. Wing On Textiles started with a 50 yuan increase on top of the limit-up price, once returning to over 2,000 yuan, but at noon, it was not far from the limit-down price. The news was conflicting, and the market was in a state of confusion, with many retail investors and those with excessive long positions being shaken out. Although the morning session carried over the momentum from Saturday afternoon, coupled with rumors of capital increases and large bills, the opening was generally positive. Wing On Textiles even opened high to the limit-up price of 13,860 yuan. However, with public utilities soaring to six times their value, there was some trepidation. Nos. 226 and 65 were sold at 13,700 yuan, and Nos. 76 and 4 were bought, repeatedly approaching the limit-up price and even exceeding it by 50 yuan. China Xing, Zhabei, Wing Yip, and China Match reached the limit-up price, but the actual sales of yarn and cloth were mediocre, and credit was tight. Nos. 224 and 164 were actively sold at high prices, falling to 13,080 yuan. Nos. 176 and 12 bought slightly at low prices, rising to 13,250 yuan. Unfavorable rumors circulated frequently, and many retail investors were forced to sell due to tight credit. Nos. 60 and 180 sold aggressively, falling to 11,950 yuan at the close. China Cement was the only one to reach the limit-up price. Compared with last Saturday, Wing On Textiles and China Match Zhabei had rebounded after reaching the limit-up price. The former declined slightly, while the latter still rose by half and one percent, respectively. China Xing, Lian Di, Wing Yip, and China Cement reached the limit-up price. China United and Everbright rose by half a percent, Jin Hing fell by one percent, and Mayar, Shanghai Cement, Jing Fu, New Kwong, Underwear, Jing Lun, China Hua Fung, and China National Goods rose by a small percentage. New China, Commercial Press, China Silk were flat, and the rise and fall of other stocks were minimal.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Wing On Textiles opened at 13,150 yuan. Nos. 169 and 225 bought at 12,750 yuan, but No. 129 and No. 89 sold, immediately dropping to 12,270 yuan. Thereafter, the price fluctuated erratically, seesawing around 12,500 yuan. Before the close, Nos. 218 and 216 bought at 12,850 yuan, and Nos. 185 and 99 re-emerged at high prices, returning slightly to 12,500 yuan. The national banks had an exchange surplus. Nos. 170 and 145 bought at 12,700 yuan, ending the session. Compared to the morning close, Wing On Textiles, Mayar, New Kwong, Jing Fu, China National Goods, China Hua Fung, and Underwear each rose by half a percent. Wing On Public Utilities and Zhabei declined slightly. Among the various unlisted stocks outside the market, China Communications, Ta Sheng, and China Hua Cheng performed well, with China Communications rising by a strong half a percent. Cultural stocks were generally flat but slightly weaker, and the remaining stocks were only stable.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday, after an initial rise, government bonds retraced, with gains and losses being minimal, and trading volume was only 2 million. Series C opened at 1.2 million in the morning, with a high of 1.26 million, but the price could not be sustained and retreated to 1.16 million at the close. Compared with last Saturday, Series A, B, and E each rose by 20,000 yuan, Series C rose by 10,000 yuan, and Series D declined slightly by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Although Credit Is Tight, Banks Have Surpluses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit in Shanghai was slightly tight. Four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury still had a total surplus of 875.7 billion in the interbank clearing of bills of exchange.

<h3>Rumors of Gold Nationalization</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Solemnly Denies</p>
<p>Bank Vault Employees Are Very Busy</p>
<p>President Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank solemnly denied yesterday the rumors circulating in the market that the government has decided to nationalize gold and freeze bank vaults. According to Mr. Yu, the government has no such plans, and people should not believe the rumors. However, people in Shanghai who hold gold and banknotes have been rushing to banks to deposit and withdraw them. From morning till night, the major banks with vaults were crowded. Vault employees were overwhelmed, but they were puzzled as to why customers suddenly moved together.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Central Bank Branch Officially Begins Auctioning Short-Term Treasury Bills (Two-Month Term)</h3>
<p>The Tianjin branch of the Central Bank began auctioning short-term treasury bills (two-month term) for the 37th year, starting from the 2nd, and entrusted the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to officially auction them at the Tianjin Securities Exchange. The previous one-month term bills had achieved good results since they were sold in Tianjin.</p>

<h3>1,500 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Are Being Distributed Today</h3>
<p>Cube Sugar Is Already Being Manufactured in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Company continued to sell white refined sugar yesterday, slowing down the rise in sugar prices. White refined sugar vouchers for the 9th shipment were priced at 58.2 million for immediate delivery and 59.2 million for next-day delivery, a slight increase of 1 million. Only crude sugar was priced at 2.5 million higher, as it had not been distributed for several shipments.</p>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently leased the former British Taikoo Sugar Refinery site and all of its equipment, and began manufacturing cube sugar in large quantities last month. Currently, the daily output has reached around 4,000 pounds, most of which will be exported to compete in foreign markets and earn foreign exchange, in addition to supplying some local needs.</p>
<p>The tenth price distribution of Taiwan sugar will be handled starting from the 2nd. It is reported that the total amount distributed this time is about 1,500 tons.</p>
<h3>Keemun Tea Trading Is Quiet</h3>
<p>When the tea market opened yesterday morning, British export firms offered prices for this year's Keemun black tea at only around 123 million per lot, which was still far from the asking price of 150 million from the sellers. The trading atmosphere remained gloomy. However, local shops and firms were still making small purchases to meet retail demand, so the process was not entirely desolate. As for other varieties, after the index rose steadily, the principals felt that the cost had increased, so their intention to raise prices became more intense, and the trend continued to accelerate. However, buyers were cautious about high prices and hesitated, so the prices quickly returned to a flat level. The closing results were similar to those of last week, with no significant fluctuations. The base price, however, was even more solid, and the prospects remained tight.</p>
<h3>Demand for Imported Pine Is Weak</h3>
<p>In yesterday's timber market, the price of imported pine was raised due to the increase in exchange settlement certificates, but there were few transactions due to weak actual sales. The market for fir remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Registered U.S. Dollar Savings Bonds</h3>
<p>When the Endorsement Does Not Match the Original Registered Seal</p>
<p>Payment Should Be Made Only After a Court Ruling</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Regarding the handling of cases where the endorsement on registered U.S. dollar savings bonds does not match the original registered seal, financial authorities explained that payment should be made only after a court confirmation and ruling. When making payment, the bondholder should also provide reliable insurance to ensure caution.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Raises Funds to Purchase Salt for Barter Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that although barter trade between China and Japan continues, the trade volume is very small. China's main exports are bran, ramie, and bean cake, while Japan's main exports are surplus wood. Food was a major export item to Japan in previous China-Japan barter trade, but this year it could not be exported due to a lack of funds to purchase salt. The China Trust Bureau is raising funds by mortgaging Japanese woolens to finance the purchase of salt.</p>
<h3>Woolens Turn Strong from Flat</h3>
<p>The woolen market turned strong again yesterday from flat, because domestic and foreign credit conditions had eased, interbank lending rates had fallen by more than half, and prices of rice, public utilities for land and water transport, and public utilities had risen sharply. China Textiles opened at a 5% increase, and buyers and sellers retreated to advance. However, there were still few transactions at the tea parties and among major wholesalers in the morning and afternoon. Most people are waiting to see whether China Textiles will change its price on Wednesday. Currently, a situation of mutual rejection has formed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Initially Rises Then Falls Back; 客帮 (Guest Merchants) Nearing Settlements, Frequently Reveal Unease and Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw tight credit within the industry, rapid stock declines, and cotton cloth prices dropping after an initial rise. Sentiment was uncertain and unsettled. Actual sales on this street were slow, while selling pressure within the market intensified.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened strong, up 60,000 to 70,000, but then news circulated that the yarn association would continue selling off stock. Six varieties, including Double Globe, were priced slightly lower than the previous weekend. The market had abundant capital, and those going long couldn't overcome the interest burden. Furthermore, bearish rumors arose, triggering sales. Confidence weakened further, eventually causing a decline to close at the 2 billion mark, down 50 million from the weekend. The shipping quote for tomorrow is also down 50 million.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse yarn initially jumped 40,000 to 50,000, but supply soon exceeded demand, ultimately leading to a decline of 70 million. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also uniformly declined by 20 million to 100 million, with only 42 or 43 deals made.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened following the strong momentum of the weekend, with most people bullish. Tianjin merchants initially bought in, and traders and cloth merchants competed to drive prices up. 12-yard Dragon Head fine cloth soared all the way to an unprecedented high of 61 million, a rise of more than 4 million compared to the previous weekend.</p>
<p>However, after 10:30 AM, news of a stock market correction and tightening credit spread. Simultaneously, rumors emerged that the authorities would establish a special price control agency in the city to suppress speculation and hoarding. Merchants from the Yangtze River region, facing difficulties in remitting funds, started selling off stock. Tianjin and Sichuan merchants also released large quantities, using rumors to facilitate sales and secretly unloading inventory. Confidence suddenly weakened, creating a situation of supply exceeding demand, and the market declined sharply. The price ultimately settled at 57.5 million, down 2.5 million from the weekend. Prices outside the exchange fell by more than 10%. Other cloth markets saw mixed ups and downs, but fluctuations were generally stable. A total of 1,800 bolts were traded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Dragon Head fine cloth sold by 紡建 (Fangjian) Company last weekend was priced at 56.7 million, second-grade Yuan Bi Ji at 51.1 million, and Si Jun Zi bleached cloth at 57.5 million, with few subscribers.</p>

<p>[Report by this newspaper] London, 2nd broadcast: The tense atmosphere of the Olympic 100m final was relived today in the men's 800m final.

Both the first-place winner, Whitfield of Iowa University, and the second-place winner, Winter of Jamaica, broke the Olympic record of 1 minute 49.8 seconds set by the British runner Hampson in Los Angeles in 1932. The third-place winner, Hanson of France, also tied the Olympic record. The gaps between the three were only a few inches. The 82,000 spectators in the grandstands could not determine who would win, but cheered enthusiastically. When Whitfield's name was displayed on the record board and the Stars and Stripes flew on the flagpole, American spectators erupted in cheers for the sixth gold medal.

<h3>Olympic Football Tournament, First Week Results: England, France, Denmark, and Yugoslavia Advance to the Quarterfinals</h3>
<p>[Report by this newspaper] London, 1st broadcast: The first week of the football tournament was characterized by extremely fierce competition. In four matches, only Yugoslavia's match against Luxembourg was easy, while the remaining matches, England vs. Netherlands and Denmark vs. Egypt, were decided after extra time. France's 2-1 victory over India was also highly entertaining. Yugoslavia, England, Denmark, and France secured the right to advance to the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>(1) In the England vs. Netherlands match, the Dutch opened the scoring early through center-forward Abel. After 20 minutes, the English team equalized. In the second half, the English team fought hard and scored again. However, after five minutes, Abel equalized again, forcing a 2-2 tie. In the final ten minutes, England scored again, taking the lead for the second time, but in the blink of an eye, the Dutch team, attacking in full force, equalized. In extra time, England's McIlvenny scored, and the English team defended with all their might, managing to hold on in the face of a relentless Dutch onslaught until the end of the match, winning 4-3.</p>
<p>(2) Denmark and Egypt were evenly matched, making the match extremely tense. There were no goals in the first half. In the second half, Denmark scored first, but Egypt equalized within a minute. Until the end of the match, neither side could score again.

<p>(3) Both France and India excel at short passes, so the match was characterized by delicate and fast-paced tactics, without the sweeping, organized attacks. France took the lead with a goal in the first half. Not long after the start of the second half, India missed a penalty kick. After 25 minutes, the Indian team was compensated, forcing a tie.

<h3>Blacks Excel at Sprints, Delat's Explanation: Tropical Environments Are Suitable for Sprinting</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, August 1st] Delat, the black track and field athlete who tied the Olympic record for the 100m in this edition of the Games, said today that African Americans are particularly good at sprints because they have short bursts of speed but lack the endurance for long-distance running. He continued, "In reality, the only difference between blacks and whites is skin color. I do not believe in any mysterious explanations, such as black people having better muscle structure, or that we are closer to 'nature' than whites. I believe that blacks excel at sprints because most of them live in tropical areas and have environmental conditions suitable for sprinting." He pointed out, "Even white athletes cannot run a five-mile race in ninety-degree heat. In terms of physical strength, there is really no difference between whites and blacks. Although many blacks are known for their sprinting abilities, it is not surprising."</p>
<h3>Li Shiqiao Has Not Yet Arrived, Our Delegation's Life is Monotonous, Chinese Chefs Provide Delicious Meals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] Our Olympic delegation has been living at the Keelpat Vocational School for a week now. Because the school's facilities are not as good as those at the Oaksbridge Olympic Center, entertainment options and sports equipment are lacking, causing the athletes to feel bored and disappointed. They have complained about the monotony of their lives and often have nothing to do except for competition days. Since moving to the Keel school, our delegation has lost the opportunity to observe athletes from other countries practicing at Oaksbridge, especially missing the chance to see the latest training methods adopted by the American delegation. However, a major advantage of the new accommodation is that there are many Chinese chefs, providing delicious meals. Oaksbridge only offered Western food, accompanied by cold meats and vegetables. Some athletes have occasionally gone to nearby Keel to enjoy the foreign scenery. Most find it difficult to go out due to language barriers, so they stay in their rooms, playing cards and having fun. Most amusingly, the officials of the delegation, whose rooms are on the fifth floor, have to go up and down several times a day, complaining of excessive exercise and muscle stiffness, as the Keel school does not have an elevator. Many of the officials participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and enjoy talking about the scale and facilities of that event. However, the track and field athletes remain very enthusiastic. Although Lou Wenfang and Huang Liangzheng failed to win medals in the competition on the 30th, they were not discouraged or resentful and gained valuable experience. In particular, Lou Wenao, despite having blisters on both feet, finished the entire race, and his courage was highly praised by his teammates. The basketball team lost its first match, but morale is high. Those who unfortunately injured their feet during the match with Chile have now recovered. They are all eager to win their first victory in the match against Belgium at Harringay tonight. It is still uncertain whether forward Li Shiqiao will arrive in time to participate.</p>

<h3>10,000 Meter Final - Dispute Over Rankings - Someone Ran One Lap Short - Norway Protests Thus</h3>
<p>[Associated Press London, August 1st] Scandinavian track and field officials are indignant about the misclassification of many athletes in last Friday's 10,000-meter final, calling it "a rare and enormous disgrace in international competition."</p>
<p>Norwegian track and field team leader Noren stated: Track and field officials miscounted the number of laps the athletes should run, resulting in at least twelve people running one lap short. Noren stated: Norwegian athlete Kjeldson was officially listed as eighteenth. If the track and field officials had not miscounted one lap after twenty laps, Kjeldson should have been eighth or ninth.</p>
<p>Noren stated: Kjeldson noticed the officials' mistake and automatically completed the entire course, but other athletes, including Belgium's Efra and the Netherlands' Latoste, ran one lap short.</p>
<p>Noren personally felt the most distressed about Stogen and Sweden's Denhoff, who were officially listed as fifth and sixth. Although track and field officials from Sweden and Norway protested, their rankings were ultimately not changed.</p>
<p>Noren stated: Denhoff claimed that he was the fifth person to complete the entire course after Stogen. He said: "After the race, we protested to the track and field director Hulte, and Hulte promised to correct it. By Saturday, the official record still had not been changed. Now the authorities say that this matter will be resolved after the games are over."</p>

<h3>Ministry Order for Provinces and Cities to Submit - Education and Culture Expenditure Estimates - Carefully Calculating to Meet Constitutional Requirements</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, August 2nd] The Ministry of Education issued two orders to the Education Bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating: It has been found that the "Education and Culture Expenditure" budgets compiled by various provinces, cities, and counties in the past years often lack legal standards. The listed amounts differ greatly from actual needs, resulting in the failure to implement various projects according to the original plans, which affects educational development. Now that constitutional governance has begun, the standards for budgeting and expending education and culture expenditures at all levels have been clearly stipulated in Article 164 of the Constitution. Subsequently, when compiling full-year or half-year estimates, various provinces, cities, and counties should reasonably allocate the "Education and Culture Expenditure" items to meet the constitutional requirements. Careful calculations must be made. Whether the estimated budget for the second half of this year has been compiled by the province or city should be promptly submitted to the Ministry for review and approval. Compliance is required.</p>

<h3>Reminiscence</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>When Aihua left me, I cried! Now that Dong Zi'ang has left me, I cry again!</p>
<p>They are both my so-called servants, but they are also my friends.</p>
<p>I envy people who often change an employee every three days or every two days. Although ordinary people find this painful, it is better than the feeling of sadness that I inevitably feel every time I spend a long time with an employee and then separate.</p>
<p>Aihua and Dong Zi'ang, both unwilling to continue this way, went their separate ways. Aihua told me before she left: She would rather starve to death than be a slave after leaving me. Except for serving me, she would never serve anyone else in this world, because no one would respect her like I did, treating her as a friend. So I sympathized with her ambition and let her go. Now she works in a textile factory. She came to see me the day before yesterday, and I was relieved that her life was secure and that she had finally learned a skill.</p>
<p>After Aihua left, Dong Zi'ang came. He was a young and strong northern lad who had fought in the war. He served as a soldier with a relative. Two years ago, the relative transferred him to me because he could make pasta, which helped prevent my stomach problems from recurring for two years. Friends often advised me that it was inconvenient to use boys. But I alone did not think so. I myself have a boyish personality, and I do not have the habits of ordinary young ladies. I do the trivial things myself, my clothes are washed by the old woman next door, and he only cooks for me and runs errands. But he has an aspiring heart. He chose a profession that he liked: the automobile industry. He hopes to be a driver in the future. He said:</p>
<p>"I'll go learn first, and come back after I learn it. I'll cook for you at the same time, and when you have a car, I'll also be your driver."</p>
<p>"I won't have a car," I laughed.</p>
<p>"You can't be poor your whole life," he said confidently.</p>
<p>This reminded me that last year, after I published an article in the Dongfang magazine called "Peach and Plum Autumn Wind," which commemorated my fall to being a rickshaw student, a reader who was learning to drive a car in Hangzhou saw it. He was moved and wrote me a letter, saying that after he graduated, he would come and be my driver. I told him I wasn't in the car class. He also said that he would wait until I had a car. Now Dong Zi'ang is saying the same thing, and I think to myself: The car is still a shadow, but two drivers have been booked, which makes me both cry and laugh.</p>
<p>To fulfill Dong Zi'ang's wish, I asked a friend to introduce him to the Suzhou Ziqi Training Group to learn how to drive a car. Before he left, he said goodbye to me. He tearfully urged me to take care of myself and drink less alcohol. I nodded frequently to accept his kindness. When I sent him to the stairwell, my eyes blurred! Returning to the study, I thought that if there were no feelings between people, there would be less trouble! But I am the most emotional person.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, I used a male servant who still sends me letters. I constantly remit money to help him. He is now in Henan, waiting for the train to pass, and he wants to find me again to serve me. He is the most loyal person. I remember once when I was sick, he secretly boiled an extra bowl of my medicine. He knelt in the yard and prayed to heaven for me, and then he drank the bowl of medicine. His foolish sincerity can be imagined.</p>
<p>Aihua and Dong Zi'ang are also very loyal people. They understand my life, understand my personality, and Aihua never asked me to increase her salary. I automatically increased it, and she always declined for a long time. As long as Dong Zi'ang saw that I ate half a steamed bun less for a meal, he would seriously frown. If I ate one more steamed bun for a meal, he would also be seriously happy. All of this made me sincerely moved and sincerely comforted.</p>
<p>Why are they so kind to me? Is it my good fortune because I happened to meet good people? No, I believe that there are no absolutely bad people in the world, it just depends on how you treat them. You give him one point of affection, and he will give you one point of loyalty! You love him, and he will not hate you for no reason.</p>
<p>My friends often laugh at me for treating servants too democratically. For example, if they accidentally did something wrong, I would find reasons to forgive them. I never interfered with them going out to play after work, and I also tried to find free movies for them to watch. Sometimes I even entertained with them. I sat in the room, and they could also sit on the side and talk to me. (This is absolutely intolerable to others.) Every New Year and holidays, they toasted me, and I toasted them back. In short, we are equal and classless. Why not? They and I are the same people; have the same independent personality; they only sell their labor to help me with what I cannot do and make a living because they are poorer than me, just as I have to sell my mental effort to write articles for a living. Therefore, I have no reason not to respect them. My publisher has no reason not to respect me. This mood has been cultivated since I was a child. When I was a child, I made friends with the little maids. I never had a master-servant concept. I have never regarded them as slaves, because everyone has a slave component, and everyone has a higher and greater authority above them. Therefore, even if you treat them as slaves, someone will treat you as a slave, and at the same time, they are also authorities, at least their children are their slaves.</p>
<p>But is my temper really good? No! I will also get angry once or twice a year. When I get angry, it's like thunder, it's over in one flash. I don't like nagging, and I never bear grudges in my heart. However, this kind of anger is not necessarily directed at my servants. Perhaps I have more opportunities to be angry at those authorities.</p>
<p>However, I did get angry at Aihua and Dong Zi'ang. Although I had reason to be angry at the time, now that I think about it, I regret it. I once made their hearts feel oppressed! Why didn't I control it?</p>
<p>Now, Aihua and Dong Zi'ang have left one after another. What they have left me is a memory of benevolence and righteousness; what should I give back to them? It is the passion of full reminiscence!</p>
<p>Wiping away the tears from the corners of my eyes, I silently wish Aihua and Dong Zi'ang well!</p>
<h3>"Noble" Music</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>At this time and in this country, art and life seem to be disconnected and are trending towards extremes.</p>
<p>Taking the more numerous middle class (i.e., those who live on salaries) as an example, if they are hungry for pianos, records, radios, and concert tickets in addition to making a living from their jobs, they will inevitably be ridiculed by the ruthless reality as "affected," or, in a new way of writing: "Learning from the bourgeoisie!"</p>
<p>For example, the piano, the basic instrument of music. No matter what you learn, you must study the piano. Therefore, either don't talk about music, or there must be a piano next to you. Even for "appreciation" alone, you cannot be outside of this, because the keyboard contains endless musical knowledge; as is the habit in civilized countries, it is even more so: "There should be a piano where there are children."</p>
<p>However, in China, pianos are mostly displayed in piano shops in Shanghai, with asking prices of more than 2 billion; others are decorated in the corners of wealthy people's living rooms, with beautiful flowers and plaster statues on top, and the piano covers are locked all year round; others are forced into singing and dancing halls, roaring with music that is unrecognizable day and night. But music academies are experiencing a piano shortage.</p>
<p>Then, of course, the piano is out of reach for ordinary people; from this, it seems that only the bourgeoisie can truly attack and practice music, but there are exceptions: In China, the sons of wealthy families who have a Grand Piano at home may not really understand the magic of music. Many of them use it to embellish luxury. If they were truly crazy about art for generations, they would never be able to afford a large piano at home today; on the contrary, "poor public school teachers, ordinary professional youths, and impoverished students are mostly truly immersed in art. Occasionally, a piano concerto heard from a radio on the side of the road will make them stop, and occasionally passing by a piano shop, they will stare at the instrument. However, reality draws a gap between these people and music.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many professional young people who may save money to rent a piano to study, but one year after the victory, the piano rent was only about 60,000 yuan per month, and in the past six months, the piano rent for old tenants has increased by more than 100% per month, and the monthly rent in July was already 15 million yuan (for a very old piano). New piano rentals are priced at 25 million to 30 million. The increase in piano rent has exceeded the cost of living index. In the future, many piano renters will probably bid farewell to the piano with tears. Music is, after all, unrelated to "ordinary people."</p>
<p>However, the most important thing is that these professional young people's admiration for music is not due to the hope of becoming famous or being applauded on stage; they know that to achieve success in learning music, one must specialize in it from an early age, and in addition to long-term hard work, one must also have innate talent. There is no miracle of anyone becoming a "master" in one fell swoop. Many amateur music learners today only start learning at a very late "musical age." Knowing that even if they spend ten or twenty years from now on, no "miracle" can be discovered, but due to a strong love, or due to personal encounters, due to the depression of the times, they deeply feel that only music can provide comfort, so they pursue music as if they are starving and thirsty. However, the times hang music high up, not allowing ordinary people to approach it!</p>
<h3>Pinghu Watermelon</h3>
<p>— Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Watermelon is a refreshing summer delicacy, and among the watermelon markets in Shanghai, our Pinghu watermelon occupies the top spot. To be fair, Pinghu watermelon does have its own characteristics. It does not have the sour taste of Jiaxing Xinfeng produce, nor is it as bland as Jiashan watermelon, nor is the flesh of Haining watermelon as crisp. Pinghu watermelon is indeed "crisp and sweet," suitable for taste, and has few seeds, which are black, bright, and shiny.</p>
<p>Merchants who specialize in watermelon start going to the countryside around the end of the fifth lunar month to put stamps on the melons that are growing in the fields and have not yet fully ripened. Everyone has their own mark, indicating that these melons have been "betrothed" by someone. People who did watermelon business last year mostly made money, but farmers were complaining because many people were deceived by merchants, who delayed payment, resulting in extremely large losses. Therefore, this year they were smarter, Shanghai and Pinghu are very close, so the farmers prepared to "grow," "transport," and "sell" themselves. Every household planted from one or two acres to more than ten acres. The quantity can be at the very beginning, if the rainfall is even, the estimated production is more than 10,000. Pinghu may become a "watermelon mountain" or a "watermelon sea." However—heaven does not follow people's will, and several days of continuous rain rotted more than 60% of the watermelon roots. When the melons were developing, they were hit by raindrops and became "pitted" melons, which are difficult to sell and easily rot, and the flesh also changed flavor. As a result, only about 20% of the melons could be exported, which is less than one-third of the previous year's production.</p>
<p>The price of watermelons in Shanghai the previous week was only 3 million per load, but these days it has risen to the 10 million mark. There are fewer people in Shanghai who eat watermelons after the Beginning of Autumn. Now there are only six or seven days left before the Beginning of Autumn festival, and the last few days have been particularly hot, so Pinghu watermelons in Shanghai are in the golden age. And those watermelon merchants, who Pinghu people call "watermelon young masters," must also be more active these days.</p>
<p>The origin of Pinghu watermelons covers the entire county, with the area around Tingzi Bridge outside the South Gate being the best. About 800,000 to 900,000 watermelons can be transported to Shanghai this year. The good watermelons have all gone to Shanghai, and we Pinghu people rarely get to eat good watermelons!

<h3>American Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>According to the American Korean Weekly, the US Army and Navy authorities have selected 200 young officers and asked them to learn Russian.</p>
<p>Former American Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, and Roosevelt rarely ate out. Truman, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. He especially likes to accept invitations from old friends for casual chats.</p>
<p>Eisenhower's main pastime is playing bridge, and he is quite skilled. Douglas (Democrat), a Justice of the US Supreme Court who was once rumored to be running for Vice President, likes to collect autographs of celebrities. He has already collected the autographs of every US President.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party in the United States is experiencing extreme economic panic. Donations are scarce, and income is insufficient. New York State, California, and Texas used to donate a lot of money to Roosevelt's election campaign, but this time they are standing by and watching Truman.</p>
<h3>Naked Prime Minister</h3>
<p>— Nan Wu</p>
<p>Half a month after the Pearl Harbor incident broke out, Churchill led the highest-ranking generals of the British General Staff to the United States.</p>
<p>The British Prime Minister became a guest of the White House. He lived in the guest room upstairs in the Presidential Palace, opposite the room of Hopkins, Roosevelt's number one favorite. The upstairs of the White House was originally very quiet, and rarely did anyone walk around, but at this time it became the headquarters of the British Empire, with civil and military officials carrying briefcases coming and going constantly. The White House's dishes were also more abundant than usual, and fine wines often appeared, of course.</p>
<p>According to Hopkins, one day President Roosevelt sat in a wheelchair and went to the Prime Minister's room. Unexpectedly, Churchill jumped out of the bathroom completely naked! I saw that this old man had just taken a bath, and he was not wearing a thread, and he was rubbed red. Roosevelt was shocked and apologized repeatedly. Churchill, however, didn't care and declared that it didn't matter. He said nicely: "The Prime Minister of Great Britain does not need to hide anything from the President of the United States."</p>
<p>Hewitt, another Roosevelt brain trust (he was a famous playwright, and he was the one who wrote many of Roosevelt's speeches), went to ask Churchill if this was reliable. Churchill hurriedly said, "Completely nonsense." He said that at least he always had a towel around his waist when he saw the president. Then, Churchill said slyly, "Would I say anything to the President that doesn't need to be concealed? Even if I said it, the President wouldn't believe it!" (Excerpted and translated from Hewitt's "Hopkins Secret Records")</p>
<h3>Also a Record of Wu Qingyuan</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>This newspaper published Yu Shoujun’s record of Wu Qingyuan's affairs at the Japanese Go Institute. The account is extremely detailed. Wu is the premier Go player of our time, young and strong, with limitless potential. In the past, in our country, he couldn’t even support himself, and was thus recruited by the Japanese. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>I recall around 1923 or 1924, Wu already had a great reputation. He and his brother often played Go at Chunming Hall in Zhongshan Park. Those who played against him were invariably defeated. At the time, Duan Zhirui was in power in Beijing, and he provided a monthly stipend to support Wu’s playing and studying Go. Later, when Duan stepped down, Wu became despondent in Beijing, with no opportunities. In 1927, Cao Rulin arrived in Beijing from Japan, accompanied by a certain Japanese 6-dan master (I have forgotten his name, perhaps it was the 7-dan Yasui Kensaku mentioned by Yu Shoujun). He invited those in Beijing skilled in Go to compete. At the time, the veteran players were afraid to accept the challenge, so they suggested Wu and scheduled a match. The idea was that Wu was young, so even if he lost, it wouldn’t matter, but if he won, it would be a great source of pride. It was a trick reminiscent of the Tang Dynasty sending against the Korean Prince.</p>
<p>Cao booked the entire Qingyun Pavilion teahouse outside Qianmen, using it as the Go playing venue. He advertised the event in the newspaper to gather enthusiasts. About two hundred people unexpectedly gathered that evening, crowding the entire floor, a remarkable scene. Wu, playing black, played against the Japanese player in a small room inside the teahouse. Four large tables were set up outside the room, each with a Go board. Two people were assigned to each table. Every time a piece was played inside, a person would announce it loudly, and the four tables outside would duplicate the move. The crowd watched and quietly commented. Wu played his moves very quickly, while the Japanese player played more and more slowly. Wu was thin and young, seemingly too weak to wear his clothes. The Japanese player was in his thirties, robust and sturdy, sitting like a mountain. Everyone feared Wu would be defeated and rooted for him, hoping Wu would make a winning move with each announcement. Later, the game became more and more intense, and the crowd became increasingly nervous, gradually reaching a critical point. At the time, Wu’s moves seemed to be taking the lead, promising a victory. Unexpectedly, the Japanese player made a move, and the audience gasped, believing that this brilliant move was enough to reverse the decline, and the outcome was uncertain. Then Wu responded with a move, and the audience was greatly relieved again, praising it as a divine move, believing that the Japanese player's previous move was powerless. After a long time, the Japanese player made another move, and the crowd became anxious, saying that this move was very powerful, capable of turning a losing game into a Ko fight. How the Ko fight would unfold was anyone's guess. Then Wu responded with another move, and the crowd was greatly relieved, saying that the Ko fight was no longer possible, and victory was assured. Whispers of praise arose from all around. Afterwards, a long time passed again, but the Japanese player still didn't play a move. The time had reached past 11 o'clock. The spokesperson inside the room then announced to the crowd: "It is late at night, and there is not enough time to finish the game. We will now draw a diagram of the current state of the game and schedule a later date to complete it. We will still advertise it in the newspaper for everyone to watch." After several days, the newspaper finally published the news, stating that the Japanese player had admitted defeat and would not complete the game. During the game, both sides were completely focused. The Japanese player held his arms, staring at the Go board. It took a long time before he would play a move. Wu responded very quickly, but on his thin, pale face, the veins were already showing. He had no time to eat the tea snacks and fruit that were brought to him. The most amusing thing was that the people outside were very crowded. Wu was small, seemingly afraid to go out. When he needed to urinate, the teahouse attendant had to carry him outside and then carry him back inside. Today, recalling those old days, it is still vividly clear in my mind.</p>
