<h3>協助我國復興農村　中美今晨在京換交　五人委員會即正式成立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕中·美兩國關於美國援華方案中所規定之中國農村復興聯合委員會之換文，將於五日上午在外部由王外長及司徒大使分別簽署交換。依據此項換文之規定，由杜魯門總統所委聘之美國專家二人及蔣總統所委聘之中國專家三人所組成之委員會，將正式成立，於賴普漢氏指導及管理下，運用出售美援物資收入之百分之十，以擬定並執行中國農村復興計劃，其中包括必要之硏究工作與訓練活動，然此項工作暫僅以此次美援為其支持繼續至款項完畢之日止。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕關於美貸所規定之農村復興聯合委會之換文事，四日政務會已予通過，聯合委會主委爲國人，聞已內定爲晏陽初，美人畢範宇亦將爲委員之一，惟委員之任命係出總統之任命，故在換文簽字後，總統發布任命令後，該會即可籌組成立。記者頃訪晤晏氏，請談對農村興興之意見，晏氏謙稱，委會人選尙未確定，渠不擬發表何項談話，惟關於農村復興之名稱，則云：農村復興應改爲鄕村建設，因鄕村之範圍較農村爲大，且我農村過去未興，何來復興。再者，以英文翻譯亦應爲鄕村建設。晏氏對此項貸款之運用，認爲應能使其運用恰當，充分發揮其效能，盼能用於人民身上，並首擇其要區辦理。記者旋復詢其是否專用於土地改革，農產水利等項，晏氏則稱否。鄉村敎育同屬重要，亦爲運用對象之一。</p>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕賴普漢一行十人，四日晨八時半離平飛青轉京。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕賴普漢四日下午五時一刻自平經經青島飛抵京，準備出席五日上午在京舉行之中美關於中國農業復興換文儀式，聞賴氏日內即將赴滬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美援棉花第一批緊急配棉一千三百七十萬美元，業經美國經濟合作總署批准動用，該款可購棉花七〇三七八包，花旗，大通，保證信託等銀行均已開出押匯，日內即可報關，預計十日內可開始提貨。頃悉：第二批美援棉花，計共三千三百七十萬美元，亦由經合總署批准動用，央行得訊後，已電請我國駐美技術顧問　與經濟合作總署所指定之押匯銀行，洽商辦理手續。</p>
<h3>實行援華計劃即將在京談判　史蒂爾曼本週末返華</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日電〕美經濟合作總署駐華技術調査團團長史蒂爾曼，將於本週末返歸南京，以與中國政府開始談判經濟合作總署在援華計劃下將資助實行之計劃。史蒂爾曼昨抵此後，曾與經濟合作總署署長霍夫曼及該署其他官員商討中國建設計劃，渠返華時將携有明確之指禾，以作爲將來談判時之南針。此項談判，將由該署中國分署署長賴普漢進行，史氏吿記者謂，彼等對於中國局勢，頗爲明瞭，渠返華府之目的，在於協助對中國官方與非官方所建議之多端計劃，採取決定，至於有謂渠此次携回儘先實行之計劃單，以求經濟合作總署批准一說，實屬不確。史蒂爾曼對於其向此間官方提出之報吿書內容亦未肯發表。該報吿與其他美國官員關於中國之報吿相同，亦充滿秘密之色彩。渠强調謂：關於中國建設計劃，如有任何報吿，則該報吿將爲中國美援運用委會及經濟合作總署經祥細充分討論及談判後聯合發表之報吿。史氏答記者詢問謂：粵漢路確曾要求二千萬美元，以供修從，該請求正在攷慮中。至於長江以北地區之任何計劃，是否亦在攷慮中，渠未能說明：「余表示經濟合作總署對於此一種計劃必須先決定政策，然後再與中國討論。」記者又詢及華北方面之建設計劃，渠答謂：此等計劃，今在愼重考慮。渠承認該地區之戰事與此等計劃進行之遲緩，顯有關係。」至於經濟合作總署從事實踐中國建設計劃之一般可能性，渠解釋實踐之可能性，因地區而相異，此顯指各地區之政治及軍事情形而言。渠對於將實行某項計劃，何時開始，需費若干等問題，大部避免作答。論及官方及非官方計劃時，渠謂：已請該雙方說明彼等之需要，決不偏袒任何一方。關於經濟合作總署，已先行准可民營職業之報道，則未置可否。渠謂：採購建設計劃所需工業原料及設備之政策，仍待擬定。至於是否將不經私人貿易途徑而由國家採購，亦拒絕說明。僅謂：此尙待與中國議定。渠復論及中國之合作問題謂：吾人確已獲得中國合作，且期望中國政府全力合作。史蒂爾曼末稱：中國人士所建議之計劃所需費用，較二億七千五百萬美元經濟援華計劃中所劃定之六千萬美元大二·三倍，故此等計劃，必須裁縮，俾與能運用之款項相稱。</p>

<p>（一）所謂黨內派系問題，有的主張必須澈底消滅所謂派系，重建意志統一，力量集中的黨，有的主張不妨在一個領袖，一個主義的原則下，承認各政見不盡相同的團體，各自作合理的活動，分工合作，使其發生互相競爭進步的作用。（二）黨的社會基礎問題，有的主張本黨應代表某一社會階層，尤其是應以晨工及革命的靑年知識份子爲某礎，但也有一部份同志認爲本黨是代表全民，不能嚴格的規定代表某一階層利益。（三）黨員登記問題，有的同志主張應再行辦理黨員重新登記，嚴格肅淸腐惡份子，但有一部份同志以爲，黨圑合併後，已經辦理黨員，圑員總登記，現在雖已截止，可繼續辦理，不必再一律重新登訊。此外還有各種寳貴的意見，秘書處已經一一紀錄下來，呈報總裁核閱，並擬即行印發各同志參閱硏究。各位未提害而意見或未及發言的，請儘速以書面送來秘書處，如已發言之同志意有未盡，或恐秘書處紀錄不好，有失原義，併請另以書面補送，當即一併整理轉報總裁。</p>
<p>此次座談會舉行於立。監兩院第一期集會休會之後，中央深深感覺到，行憲以後黨的權力機關之負責同志與國家政策決定機關之本黨同志意見如何溝通問題的重大與迫切，故特地舉行座談會，虛心聽反，並徵詢在京中委及立。監兩院委員同志的意見，作爲本黨改造方案的重要依據。此次座談會意義非常重大，總裁　次指示，表示改造黨的決心，中央常會亦會　有研討，不過這次因為時間短促，不能詳盡硏討，而且現在離京的立、監委員，同志已經很多，以後如有機會，希望能够再召集一次座談會，將此次座談會整理出來的材料再行徵詢各同志的意見·此次黨的改造運動，是時代與環境所促成的，國內外期待本黨之改造甚股，唯有中國國民黨改造，方能有新生的力量，才能夠挽救國家民族的危機。國內外形勢，已不容許本黨旁　遊移，因循不決，所以此次改造運動只許成功，不許失敗。此次黨務座談會是有建設性的，積極性的，參加人數之多，同志發言的熱烈與坦率，足見同志關心黨的前途，這是給予黨的改造運動以無限的力　，相信黨的改造運動，前途一定樂觀，一定有結果。</p>
<h3>新經濟金融政策方案　政院定後日討論　財金部份將先公布施行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕翁文　之新經濟金融政策方案，四日仍未提出於政務會中討論，據接近翁氏人士稱：頃尙在作最後硏討中。政院七日將舉行臨時會，可能即於此時提出討論。並悉：該項方案中之各部份，將首先以財政金融部份公布施行，俟收有成效，再逐條付諸實施，而在該方案中所規定之檢査行莊部份，外傳將自現有六千行莊减至二千家之數，實非一般人所想像之簡單着意於整頓，如不符規定，自予停辦之處分，但決非一次封閉或其他斷然處置。四日政務會議後一度盛傳翁內閣新經濟金融政策方案於下午四時公布，旋即證明係誤傳。自二日中央日報社論「改革經濟的樞紐」一文發表後，檢査行莊之嚴正主張，已引起首都公私行莊之密切注意，隨時探詢方案內容及何時實行，各報社所接探詢消息之電話，幾至應接不暇，各行莊顯已爲政府即將有措施，而進入神經戰狀態。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕據財部最近統計：全國已設立公私銀行錢莊，截至最近爲止，總計已達五千九百一十二家，其中總行共計二千另九十家，分行爲三八二二家。茲分誌統計之詳細數字如下：（一）國家銀行七家，分行八六八家；（二）省銀行總行三十家，分行一一二一家；（三）縣市銀行總行五六六家，分行二三二家；（四）商業銀行總行二另七家，分行一一一三家；（五）錢莊總莊一另三九家，分莊一另八家；（六）信託公司總公司十六家，分公司十七家；（七）保險公司總公司二二五家，分公司三六三家。</p>

<h3>毋忘中暹親密的關係</h3>
<p>暹羅的排華運動，不僅沒有停止，最近似乎反又變本加厲了。中國學校被封閉的達二百七十所，使二萬餘的中國兒童靑年失學，千中國敎師失業，我國政府一再向暹羅政府交涉，都沒有獲得具體結果。不料這一個懸案尙未解決，而暹羅內政部竟指中國國民黨在暹羅從事政治活動爲侵犯暹羅國族之十權；甚至暹羅軍人主張，嚴禁華僑入境，暹羅議會也將決議，將限額由一萬名减至五千名。凡此種種，均可視爲暹羅當局的漢視中暹邦交。我們除了希望我國政府進行交涉據理力學而外，並盼暹羅政府飲水思源，勿忘華僑對於暹羅建國的功蹟，而任意加以摧殘壓迫。</p>
<p>老實說，暹邏沒有中國，怎會有今日？中暹兩民族的關係，遠在暹維建國千年以前，歐西史家吳德（R．S．Wood）輩　謂：「暹人與中國人，乃同派之民族，在史前兩族必是同源。」暹族先世我國世稱歹族，爲春秋時代百濮，亦即　夷的後務，自漢唐以還，內附中國。自漢明帝永平十二年起，經過魏文帝，唐高宗，玄宗，文宗，　宗，以至宋理宗，千多年來，歹族即在漢族王道蕩蕩博愛精神的卵冀下，綿延其族系。元世祖南征，遂促使歹族向中南半島擴展，從而建立速古台王朝，造成今日的暹羅。</p>
<p>再披閱暹羅三朝歷史，可知暹人最崇拜的英雄爲速古台王朝的敢不丁，即拉馬摩頂，而此大王頻向中國詣闕進貢，並招致華工入暹。從此我們僑胞遂源源而去，開發暹羅的工礦業。他們種稻本來撒在土上，一聽天命，我華僑敎他們耕種的方法，遂有一年三熟，頓成產米之國。今日他們的輸出物，佔第一位的就是米。講到藝術文化，當年何嘗不賴華僑傳播之力？敢木丁於成宗大德四年，作第三次的親到中國朝貢，帶去中國藝術工人多名，傳入中國陶器製造法，創設「宋家緣」瓷器，珍貴至今。</p>
<p>曼谷王朝的建設者鄭昭，他更是百分之百的中國人。他少年出仕暹庭，積功至太守。清乾隆三十二年，暹羅阿踰陀王朝爲緬甸甕籍牙王之子莽紀覺所滅，鄭昭應時崛起，號召復國，率軍艦溯湄南河而上，破大城，殺緬將蘇格里，奏凱舊京，暹人舉國狂歡，遂尊奉此華僑英傑爲暹王。旋復削平諸部，統一全國，征服眞臘，擴展封疆，爲暹民所愛戴。</p>
<p>今日自稱暹人的，其中至少　千萬含有中國人的血統。誠如暹七世王稱：「暹人之血統，已與華人混而爲一，不可分化。暹之高級長官，無論已往或現在，多屬華裔，即以朕躬而言，亦含有華人血統之成分焉。」的確，今日暹羅在朝達官，在野巨公，帶有中國人血統的，不知凡幾；即勝利後當政現在出走的暹國元老鑾巴立，實在也是中國人，前年來華時，他自己就曾口口聲聲說，他是廣東潮州人。</p>
<p>中國人爲暹羅寫下了光芒萬丈的史篇，我們當然不求　人感恩，但不料暹羅得魚忘筌，米拉隆功拉馬第五於淸光緒十四年進貢後，與我斷絕交往，宣統二年，拉馬第六苛待華僑，釀成曼谷總罷工，從茲排華情緒一發而不可復遏，由禮待華僑，逆轉而爲虐待華僑，甚且歧視華僑爲「東方之猶太人。」</p>
<p>自民國十七年暹設「移民局」後，排華乃益趨激烈。民廿一夏，「曼谷革命」爆發，推翻拉馬第七王室政權；翌年又起「二次革命」，肅淸親英親德的老派份子，而轉變爲親日。日本爲遂行其南進政策中「安撫暹羅」的陰謀，乃乘機挑撥中暹情感，對暹大事宣傳：「旅暹華僑人口佔暹人三分之一以上，經濟機全暹於中國人之手，事有土地權者亦甚多，此三種問題一日不解決，暹羅即一日無發展之機會。……」暹當局信此　言，竟置中暹傳統友誼於不顧，迭次頒佈苛例，華僑敎育方面有「初級敎育條例」，「民立學校條例」，嚴限華人送其子女入官立學校習　暹文，强迫華僑學校改授暹文，並加敎導暹羅地理歷史，校長必須熟訊暹文，違者罰金監禁。</p>
<p>民廿六年暹羅政變，少壯軍人領袖鑾披汶，即今捲土重來的執政者，爲討好國內人心，不惜倡導「唯國主義」，演出排華制華的悲劇，爭取民衆。及至我抗戰軍興，我海外黃帝子孫與日寇漢奸的鬥爭，日趨白熱化，日乃慫恿鑾披汶改國名曰「泰」，顯示着對華的極大野心，以致暹羅歪曲民族主義，隨狂妄的法西斯政治以俱來，愛國革新的論調，蛻變爲仇華排華的風潮。華僑便成了他們的「假想敵」，商會主席蟻光炎終於在這排華風潮裏被暴徒狙擊而犧牲了。跟着排演「九二二」的警察屠殺華僑的大血案，對我們壓迫示威，蠻幹到底，由小規模的衝突，變成大規模的殺戮，死者沉寃未雪，生者流離失所，可悲的三百萬旅暹僑胞的命運，面臨着死亡的威脅。迨後「泰國」又改爲暹羅，對僑胞似乎放鬆了一手，然而僑敎苛例始終未改隻字，僑校在大城市中勉强開設，小鄕縣裏依然縛手縛脚無法開門。政變後，著名的排華劊子手鑾披汶又上台了，於是演成今日僑校全體關門，僑生相率返國的局面。</p>
<p>我們對於暹羅，竟全忘了中暹親密的歷史，接近的地域，交流的血統，亙助的經濟，不能不表示無限的遺憾。其實，暹人即使是健忘的，但爲東亞和平計，爲本身安全計，也不應該漠視中暹邦交。而在中國政府，至今尙未見外交方面有何認眞的舉動，坐視我們的僑胞備受摧殘壓抑，也是使我們驚奇不置的一件事！</p>

<p>〔本報長沙四日電〕總統頃電程兼主席及省參議會，對湘三十七年度徵實及徵借，仍照額繳納。程氏奉電後，以目前水災遍及三十七縣，濱湖糧產僅存十之一二，水勢續漲，災區仍將擴大，甚感焦慮，除覆電盡力辦理外，並請迅派大員携帶鉅款來湘勘災。又頃據農會負實人談：湘水災嚴重，各方籲請减賦免賦，惟從宋聞减租免租呼聲，刻早稻稍有收穫之區，地主已施用極嚴格之手段催收早稻租，益陽，湘陰，沅江，各地災民不勝其擾，省農會即擬向省當局擬定减租原則，救佃農於水災。</p>

<h3>暹警突大捕華僑　五十一人被控非法謀取基金　另十三人指馬組織秘密會社</h3>
<p>〔合衆社曼谷四日電〕暹羅警察最近出人意外，突然兜捕華僑六十四人，雖其中國共雙方人士均有，然此間觀察家相信此舉係防止共產黨師法馬來故事發動叛亂。暹警稱，搜捕時尙獲大批文件，其中包括「蘇維埃民主」之黨義一份，及共黨在暹羅工作之報告一份，被捕華僑五十一人已正式被控非法謀取基金之罪，同時政府並擬加以放逐。其餘十三人被控組織秘密會社。暹報乃乘一此機會，大事鼓吹中國欲陰謀「鯨吞暹羅」。中國新聞處乃據此發表下列聲明：「中國政府駐暹代表對此項報吿大感驚異，此事旣足以促使暹人仇華而有害兩國之友誼，而中國政府代表之職責即在維持兩國友好之邦交，中國駐盤谷總領事鍾秉强（譯音）乃親訪警察局長鑾約特拉卡柯索少校，以探明所謂鯨吞暹羅陰謀之眞相。局長竭力向總領事稱，並未發現鯨吞任何國之陰謀，並稱若有此事，不特報紙之報吿，警局即已先機加以撲滅矣。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓四日廣播：馬歇爾在新聞記者招待會中，對於星期一夜三國專使在克里姆林宮會見史達林之情形，嚴守秘密。</p>
<p>〔中央社柏林四日合衆電〕德境英軍政府總督羅勃森，今突奉召返倫敦，與外務部進行商談，僉信此事與莫斯科談判有關。羅氏於清晨飛英，其顧問人員並未隨行。</p>
<h3>波蘭反對西德計劃　再度向英提抗議　認德國問題應由四強協商解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三日合衆電〕波蘭頃對英提出照會，再度抗議最近舉行討論德國問題之三强會議。是項照會，係由波蘭駐英大使於七月三十日遞交貝文外相。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕波蘭該會發表於克里姆林宮舉行柏林問題重要會議之後數小時，殊有意義。該照會有謂，「波蘭政府相信，四强之協調行動，爲公平解決德國問題與安全之正當保障。吾人深信此種解決之環境確已存在，但四强有關德國之所確切締結與束縛之諸協定，必須予以遵守，而以後之決定，由指令討論此等決定之機構定奪之。」波蘭照會內大部份仍照常指斥西方國家之政策，諾如今日習見之控斥謂，馬歇爾計劃「將使參加各國在政治與經濟上成爲附庸，同時有建立戰前歐洲經躋組織之趨勢，並以之建立德國之統治份子。」</p>
<h3>蘇佔領區警戒　柏林形勢　益趨緊張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播柏林訊：柏林形勢益趨緊張，蘇聯軍營所在地及軍人住宅區周　密佈鐵絲網及增派武裝衛兵。據居住蘇佔區內之德人稱，自柏林市民上週一製擊蘇佔區內之蘇警察以後，各街衢均遭堵塞，並有兵士駐守。同時據悉蘇聯當局曾向柏林市參議會提出要求，不帝完全控制柏林及其政府之金融及經濟。蘇當局曾對市議會宣稱：倘柏林西部當局允許蘇聯完全控制蘇聯轄區內之德國銀行，則西區資金可以解凍。</p>
<h3>美實施計劃　增强海空軍</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三日電〕美國空中國防計劃，係於六月間開始實施，其初步定貨爲　用國會撥款定造飛機三千三百穴十六架，預料此項計劃將使航空深入超空速之階段。</p>

<h3>蘇聯多瑙河公約草案　為鐵幕政策重現　聯合國要求派員列席會議被拒</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦四日電〕維辛斯基向貝爾格勒會議提出之多瑙河公約草案，含有蘇聯一貫對附庸國家使用之「鐵幕」政策，目的在使蘇聯獨　該河流。英國意見係贊成保持一九二一年之條約，會議之進行似已被維辛斯基之滋擾而擱淺。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖三日電〕聯合國請求准許特派觀察員列席貝爾格勒會議一事，已遭蘇聯拒絕。因此，聯合國將無法取得會議中關於多瑙河局勢經濟方面之論據，而此項論據，具有重大之價値，蓋多瑙河航運問題已列入經社理事會之議程中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒三日電〕多瑙河會議今日舉行第四次集會，由羅外長鮑克女士任主席，蘇代表維辛斯基與英代表員充激辯一九二一年之多瑙河公約應否廢止問題。貝克重申公約應繼續生效，渠指出彼時蘇聯之未參預會議，由於蘇聯彼時之尙未參加一切國際活動，在蘇聯開始參加國際活動後，即無人阻止其參加一九一二年之多瑙河公約。此後維辛斯基發表長篇演說，駁斥英代表之論據，並指出一九三八年之多瑙河公約成立後，西方各國實已破壞一九二一年之公約，故後者顯然已屬無效。維辛斯基又指出「君等之歐洲公約中，竟有納粹德國之參加，而無蘇聯之位　」。渠稱，在一九三四年蘇聯曾要求參加多瑙河會議，郝久久未蒙允許，而德國則終於列席矣。維辛斯基總結蘇聯之立塲稱，「離開多瑙河甚遠之國家當然無權參加策劃多瑙河航行之委員會」。至此會議宣佈延會，定明日繼續討論。明日之會議將由英代表任主席。</p>

<h3>馬共圖建共和國　受英打擊已告吹</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新加坡三日電〕馬來亞總　麥唐納三日發表全國廣播演說稱：共黨本擇定八月三日建立馬來亞之共黨共和國，因集體逮捕及英國之軍事行動而吿吹。</p>
<h3>美共間諜案迄未獲確證　美司法部無法起訴　前共黨張伯斯又指控間諜多人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕司法部高級官級官員三日稱：關於共黨間諜案，前共產黨員班特萊小姐及張伯斯在國會非美活動委員會作證前，均會向聯邦調查局報告，但三年來化費五十萬美元之調查結果，仍不能獲得充分之證據，足資起訴司法部當局現正遭遇兩項雖題：第一，關於班特萊所稱政府官員交渠轉達莫斯科之文吿尙未獲得；第二，被控之任何人，倘彼等果屬有罪者，亦均拒絕揭開內幕，而承認罪狀。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕一度曾任「新政」官員四人，三日爲前共黨張伯斯指爲戰前共黨地下組織之重要人物，此種地下組織專爲蘇聯進行間諜工作，幷從事於　覆美政府。此四人一度幾曾爲新政「後生可畏」之鉅頭，其名單爲潑萊斯曼，威脫，及亞爾格希斯與唐納希斯兩兄弟，彼等頃爲張伯斯在衆院非美活動委員會所控吿。據張氏談稱，渠曾　生命危險，於一九三七年脫離共黨。張氏現奉召赴該委會證實共黨自首人班特萊小姐上週關於共黨陰謀及間諜工作陳述之眞實性。張氏本日所指出之四人，爲國會調査共黨間諜案諸委員所第一次聞悉者，但張氏又指出其他「地下份子」多人，爲班小姐上週內所指出者，如前財次惠特即爲其中一人。該委員會本日休會後，定於四日重開，屆時前商務部官員薛佛馬斯德，將首先至該委會陳述。同時被控爲蘇聯間諜之前財部職員及空軍官員潘羅繼之張伯斯曾謂渠幷不認識班小姐。渠頃吿該委曾稱，潘羅爲戰前工作於政府中七名共黨「基本一領袖之一，其他六人爲潑　斯曼，希斯北兄，克拉茂，亞勃脫，與柯林斯。張氏復謂，威脫爲華盛頓區地下組織之領袖，威氏曾任全國勞工關係局執行秘書。亞勃脫前爲工業組織大會政治行動大會之有力份子，現爲蘇萊士之進一步黨之組織人。希斯弟兄曾在「新政」下佔國務院重要職務，方於過去兩年中卸職。亞爾格希斯現已結束其國務院經濟與政治高級顧問之任務，渠曾隨故總統羅斯　出席雅爾達會議。唐納希斯現在此執行私人法律事務，潑來斯曼早年間曾任農業調整局之法律顧問，後爲工作進展局總法律顧問，於一九三七年辭職。張氏支持班特萊小姐所控前財次惠特，在自爲高級財部官員期問與地下組織合作，張伯斯謂惠特與潑萊斯　及亞爾格希斯，同爲組成共黨「中堅」組織之一員，蓋彼等均置身於政府之中。</p>
<h3>睡眠的神秘　經科學研究結果　掃除過去錯誤觀念</h3>
<p>〔美國新開處芝加哥三日電〕睡眠為人類有生以來之一大神秘。近在美國進行之科學硏究工作，已逐漸對睡眠實驗室主任克勒滋曼博士，可謂最能熟知睡眠之人。渠發現若干關於睡眠之基本事實，可使今日舉世流行之錯該觀念一掃而光。同時其他研究家亦從事睡眠之硏究，視此爲人類最方便之老師，且可醫治精神上之疾病。經過廿五年成年成萬次之試驗，克氏證明一般觀念中認爲睡眠時移動身體，有害於夜晚之安息一點，實屬錯誤。平均每人睡眠時皆移動身體二十次至四十五次，以使全身各部皆獲得完全放鬆之機會，渠發現以廿四小時爲睡眠與淸醒之襬環週期一點，亦可加以變更。渠　在深山黑洞中，化數星期之時間作種種試騐，結果發現倘不受日夜循環之影饗，人類亦同樣可以廿」小時或廿八小時爲循環週期。因此證明此種循環週期之確定，幷非根據人體生理需要在某一特定時間內睡眠之故。根據科學化之硏究，渠發現睡眠之來臨與回醒，往往經過六種便當之步驟，有時並不十分便當。首先是脈搏與心臟跳動，其它生理作用漸趨微緩，然後在一定時間後，五官感覺逐漸消失，先是爾覺，繼爲味覺，再繼爲嗅覺，再繼爲聽覺（儘一半失去），最終爲觸貿。回醒時其過程正相反。</p>
<h3>瞻望柏林的前途（上）</h3>
<p>— 章礝石譯</p>
<p>柏林的風雲，並不是戰爭的預兆。蘇聯在柏林所採取的，目前是「慢步緊挾」的戰略，並不是「閃電般」的戰略。</p>
<p>美軍仍將留駐柏林，英國和法國也將採取同樣的步驟。但是，蘇聯不論在什麼時候，只要它喜歡，隨時可以接收柏林，</p>
<p>柏林事件的「攤牌」，大概爲時在一九四八年冬季。，假使沒有戰爭，它們是不會退出柏林的。但是，縱使不進行戰爭，蘇聯在柏林是將變爲「主人」的地位。</p>
<p>柏林，正如孤島一樣，它是位於蘇軍佔領區的中央。它與西德相距有百哩之遙，但是其與西德的水陸交通，皆被蘇聯所控制着。除了長時期中，以空運可以載柏林人所需的物資自西德到相林去之外，簡直是別無他路。　雙方的戯牌和做手勢，預料仍將在柏林繼續進行。不久的將來，柏林的危機是由沸騰而降退。</p>
<p>由柏林危機而引起戰爭，這似乎是不可能的事。果然，戰爭一開始，西方列强是將失去在柏林的勢力。至於蘇聯在它掌握之中的都市裏發生戰爭，對於它也沒有什麽益處。</p>
<p>柏林危機的結果，可能雙方成立協議，西方列强許可蘇聯去供給柏林的德國人民，西方軍隊則仍可駐留柏林。在這種情形之下，西方列强便可以避免「蘇聯對傾向西方的德人以報復的手段」，這也就是說，西方列强可以保護傾向英，美。法的德國人士，不致令他們吃蘇聯的報復手段。</p>
<p>在同一個時候，柏林危機的風波，就會沒有解決而暫息。蘇聯可能會緩和對柏林西區的封銷，但是，這機會僅在當其供給開始减削之後。蘇聯對柏林西區的封鎖緩和期約在冬季，因爲那時，柏林需要燃煤。</p>
<p>假如蘇聯的封鎖仍是饑續，或是恢復，那末，美方爲了報復計，也許會截斷巴威利安水源和能的供給，以對付蘇軍佔區。空運撤退在柏林的英·美·法三國僑民，這是很可能的事，假使危機更是熾熱，幾個主張堅硬的德國領袖將飛出柏林，幾個歡喜僑居西德的德國人民亦可能會飛遷出境。</p>
<p>柏林危機而起的，大概有下面幾件事：</p>
<p>由於自一九四五年九月十二日起的一運串約定中·英·美·法三方接受了蘇聯可以管制和控制柏林與西方水陸交通的權限，蘇聯在柏林對西方列强的緊挾，那是意料中的事。</p>
<p>結果，蘇聯不但能够切斷柏林與西方佔區的鐵路。公路和運河航路，並那三條受限制的航空綫，也在蘇聯戰鬥機的巡選中，飽受威脅·英·美·法三方的問題，現在是如何去保特眞正管理柏林四區的權限。</p>
<p>美蘇抵觸的要因，無非就是要控制這大小與美國芝加哥相等的柏林城。因爲在先後二次大戰中，柏林都是德國的京城。有這樣悠久的歷史，所以蘇聯很想將柏林作爲共黨政府的京城以便控制德國。但是英·美·法三國却阻繞這個計劃。</p>

<h3>中正東路火燒堆棧　存貯顏料被燬大宗　今晨一時火勢始殺公和來損失重大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中正東路（即愛多亞路）外灘十一弄B字一號法商龍東堆棧二層樓，昨夜十一時卅分，突發生大火。査該處大部份係爲本市江西南路廿九弄二號著名顏料商號公和來所租賃，作爲堆置存貨之用。聞昨日午後，該號尙有十五斤及廿五斤各種桶裝顏料百餘桶遝往上棧，是則可能爲搬運小工遺落火種所致。火起後因該處建築相當堅固，且門窗緊閉，而看管人員於午後五時，即行離去，故當時外界不易發覺，迨火舌穿出窗外時，勢已不可收拾。消防處接獲報吿後，立即由中央。新開河·虹口等各區隊出動帮浦車，在數分鐘內先後到達，出水灌救，終因門窗無法打開，同時二三層樓全部已成一片火海，施救極度困難，旋經設法將門窗撬開，集中水力灌救，至今晨一時，始將火勢控制，惟二層公和來所堆顏料大部份均已焚燬，另一部份受有水漬。即以公和來一家而論，損失已逾數千億。法商龍東洋行原爲三星斧頭脾白蘭地中國經理，惟因進口早受限制，故存貨堆置極微，損失不大。據公和來顏料行職員吿記者稱：所堆顏料均保有火險，內中屬於公和來本行者，佔極少數，餘均爲已售與客戶之貨云。又昨大火時，美國合衆通訊社因毘鄰龍東堆棧，工作曾因之停頓一小時。各消防隊員至今晨三時，尙未離去。</p>

<p>〔合衆社東京四日電〕佔領軍當局應英國之要求，四日逮捕一九四二年曾任上海日本警備部司令之木下少將，因木下在上海著名之橋濱大廈內，犯有慘酷罪行。在上海時，為木下少將屬下之吉田榮有曹長亦被捕。據英方發言人談稱，渠相信目前已有足够體據，可控訴該二人於虐待二十餘名盟國人員之責任。此等人員在橋濱大廈監獄內受盡磨折，且成餓莩。</p>
<h3>吿密人勾串經警　吞沒飾金三十兩　經警隊長到庭陳述　在逃兩警嫌疑重大　力言在押班長誠實可靠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地方法院吳象祖推事，昨午開審凟職案一起。緣有棉布掮客吳博帆者，與警員張林熟識，因聞密吿黑市金鈔機關，可得三成獎金，乃託其友好周允山，允匡兄弟協助探聽金鈔買賣機關，冀獲獎金，其妹夫邵星南，亦參加該項密吿團體。吳旋於無意中，聞同事項秀泉，周經偉談及新閘路七〇二號寳康銀樓有買賣金鈔情事，於是約集周氏兄弟，項秀泉，周經偉等，開闢爵祿飯店，商議密吿方法，決定由周允山化名吳震，具名向經濟警察大隊部吿密。</p>
<p>本年二月廿三日上午，經警六隊班長王樹慈奉派率領警員張林，高汝誠偕同吿密人等，前往寳康銀樓搜査，果在該店搜出小金條約四十餘塊，法幣兩億七千萬元，並在樓上搜出手飾箱一隻，內貯飾金約百兩，均由王樹慈扣封，當時該店職員沈貴根提出抗議謂：「社會局曾有命令，買賣飾金並不犯法」，要求發還飾金，經王考慮後，乃將百兩飾金全部發還，惟將金塊及法幣帳册等扣留。詎吳博帆等吿密人，以爲有機可乘，遂慫恿張林在百兩飾金中取其三十兩，僅發還寶康銀樓七十兩。次日，張林約吳等在西僑靑年會晤面，將三十兩飾金朋分化用。嗣張林與高汝誠兩經濟警察，深恐日復事發，向隊請假一去未返，迨兪叔平局長獲報，乃將王理長拘獲，而張·高兩警已不知去向。嗣據王之口供，將吳博帆等六人先後逮捕，吊出一部份原贓，解送地檢處偵訊結果，提起公訴，除王收押外，餘各交五億舖保候傳。</p>
<p>地院昨午開庭，對各被吿一一詢問，經警大隊隊長程義寬並出庭應訊，陳述該案先後經過。渠對班長王樹慈之誠實可靠，表示信賴，對張·高兩警長假不返，認爲嫌疑重大現已出票通緝歸案。庭諭改期再審，王樹慈還押，除犯交原保。</p>

<h3>公用事業漲價之因素　已非市當局所能控制　趙會珏招待記者報告調整售價經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公用局長趙曾珏，昨午五時，在市政府招待記者，報吿調整八月份公用事業價格之經過情形。渠稱：當局爲緩和公川事業漲勢，確已盡最大努力，八月二日，公用局召集調整價格會議時，與各公會負責人竭力爭特達六小時以上，結果始將各公司所要求之倍數抑低兩倍至三倍。而公用事業之漲價，已非市政當局所能控制，如外匯及燃料價格之不斷提高，對公用事業成本影響最鉅。雖吳市長於召集上次緊急會議時，曾決議公用事業所用煤斤及油料在月初一次結匯，價款由中央銀行　借。但執行不無困難，貨教總額約需十萬億元，惟中央銀行因墊款數額過鉅，已核减至五萬五千億元。</p>
<p>各油公司同意　勉予一次結購</p>
<p>趙局長繼稱：吳市長爲使公用事業油價穩定起見，特於今日（即昨日）上午召集谷油公司負責人闡述公用事業與市民生活關係之重要，請其力予協助。經一再洽商，各公司始勉予同意，對本月份各公用事業可予一次結購，但鄭重聲明下不爲例。惟目前美匯（連結匯證明書）已漲至六百萬元，各公司所貸油款因被核减之故，原祗能購二十天應用之油量，現在美匯上漲，恐又不到此數，至所貸煤款究能購到若干天需用煤量尤不可知。此次調整價格所以均自月初起算，原期使各公用事業能提早收到貨款，减少損失，而使上漲率不致過高。茲據各公司報吿用油煤貸款不足，美匯頻頻上漲等關係，本月份仍不免有鉅額之虧損，如上海電力公司，預計八月份仍將虧耗達二萬億元。</p>
<p>公用電話一次　竟收百萬之多</p>
<p>最後趙局長表示公用局無不儘量顧及市民負担，唯在目前經濟動盪，百業不易維持之際，爲謀公用事業收支平衡計，公用局能做到者只有甩分級計費之方法，使一般平民少量用戶之負祖不至過重，現在電力煤氣電話三項已經試行，將來當視成效如何推及其他，並將低級收費之數量酌予放寬。</p>
<p>後記者等曾吿以公用電話雖經當局核定爲每次十萬元，而實際上各商店及各飯館等有將價格提高至每次五十萬元甚至一百萬元以營利者趙局長聞訊後，認爲實無理由，決設法于以取締。</p>
<p>市參議員要求　新價暫緩施行</p>

<h3>世運最緊張節目　籃球賽風雲變幻　比利時擊敗智利　第二組各隊形勢分析</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球賽第一一組中鬱鬰不得志之比利時，頃以驚人之演出，以卅八比卅六，壓倒奪標呼聲曼高之智利。使第二組形勢，起重大變化，前二名之產生，尙有待於今晨中菲，及今晚智韓之兩塲大戰。</p>
<p>中國如能力克菲列賓，則所餘對伊拉克之戰，必操左券，即可以五戰四勝之偉績，稱霸第二組。設不幸而欺北，則所餘之一綫希望，將繁於比利時之能否再顯奇蹟，擊敗菲律賓，或智利再蹈覆轍，被挫於韓國。（倘菲律賓果負於比利時，智利果負於韓國，則第二組中，除伊拉克每戰輒北外，其他五隊，俱三勝二負得八分名次須以得分平均法解決。）</p>
<p>第二種假設，如菲律賓對中對比，皆獲勝利，而智利敗于韓國，則菲居首席，第二名將由中，智，韓三隊以得分平均法決定。</p>
<p>得分平均法係兼顧各隊得分失分之一種公平計算方法，以一隊得分之總和，乘以一百，然後除以失分總和，求出得分平均之百分率，百分率越大，即表示該隊凈勝分數越多。依目前形勢，智利得分最多（二四八），失分亦少（一二四），佔絕大優勢，故我國如不能戰勝菲律賓，則晋入決賽之希望，實甚渺茫。茲將第二組中菲大戰前，各隊形勢，已往戰績，及得分失分總表列下：</p>

<h3>私立小收費標準尚未定　李熙謀談政局立場　校長聯會定期鄭重商討</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕現距下學期開學爲時一月，一般學生家長對下學期本市私立中小學學費究爲多少頗表關懷，因物價之高漲，收費數字之昻貴在臆測之中，故家長現均在愁慮如何籌措。敎局長李熙謀昨談：各中小學收費標準現尙未訂定。如有不得敎局同意，私自訂定高昻學費者，當報請市長加以處分。敎局立塲需兼顧學生學業與學校之維持，故在不妨碍學生之學業情况下，設備佳良辦理完善之學校，酌增學費，當可考慮同意。李局長認爲本市有半數家長可負担其子弟下學期之學費，其餘半數則可向學校申請免費待遇。各私校免費額雖定爲百分之二十，但如超過定額，其經費可由敎局補助。敎局並正進行籌募淸寒學生獎學金，以助無力入學者。至公務員子弟除原機關已有敎育津貼或辦有子弟學校者外，可由其家長函敎局申請免費。此外對於本市少數私校有收取雜費超過學費等情，亦決予嚴格取締。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據本市私立中小學校長聯合會理事長蔣紀周表示：該會將於本月二十日左右召開大會，鄭重商討下學期收費標準。該一標準需兼顧學生家長負担，提高敎師待遇與維持學校生存。</p>

<h3>癌症的福音</h3>
<p>— 如是</p>
<p>從前我有一個朋友，忽然覺得吞咽食物的時候喉頭有些疼痛，最初當然以爲祗是普通的乳蛾之類，並不介意；到後來竟痛得極利害，他本來是一位數學敎負，到那時竟連書都不能敎了，一說話就痛。大家勸他快到醫院檢査，醫生替他拍了一張X光照，却同時也宣布了他的死刑！</p>
<p>醫生說：「這是癌，生在甲狀體上。」</p>
<p>我那位朋友在那一天之後就悄然回到了原籍。他本來是學自然科學的人，很了解癌是比肺病都可怕的東西。我們寫信問候，他也不再作覆。</p>
<p>兩三個月之後，就接到了他的訃　。</p>
<p>郝而，科學家正在默默地努力着。制伏這個可怕的癌症，已經有一綫希望了。</p>
<p>一九四六年七月，紐約專門研究治療癌症的紀念醫院（Memoria　Hospital）裏，走進了一位七十三歲的老病人。他的名字呌亨利·霍爾，本來是一位採訪國際消息的新開記者，也編過書，講過學，然而那時却在田狀體上生了癌，而且這癌還蔓延到了他的臀部，右腿已成癱廢。求診的那一天又不當心跌了一交，腿骨脫了骱，情形相當嚴重，痊愈的機會是極渺茫的。</p>
<p>但是，這位霍爾先生至今尙在人世，面色紅潤，精神煥發，表面上竟已看不出是一個有病的人。而且，那條右腿竟也漸漸有力，勉强可以支持了。</p>
<p>但是，醫生們鄭重聲明，他的癌並沒有好，不過癌的發展已經制止而已。</p>
<p>霍爾是一個「試驗病人」，他自願供醫院實驗各種新療法。醫生吿訴他放射性物質或者對他的病體有助，但醫生對此所知不多，問他是否願意一試。他欣然答應了。</p>
<p>甲狀體吸收碘質的力量極强，但在百分之八十五的多數情形中，生了癌的甲狀體往往會停止吸收碘質。霍爾正好是這幸運的少數人之一，他的生了癌的甲狀體竟然還是要「吃」碘。而甲狀體這個東西極「笨」，牠不能辨別牠所吸收的碘有沒有放射性。這放射性的碘却不是好惹的，他一碰着甲狀體就大肆破壞，不管牠有癌沒有癌，來一個「格殺勿論」。虧得甲狀體本來是人體中沒有什麼用處的東西，若是肝腎等部就不行了。</p>
<p>霍爾第一次飲含有放射性碘質的溶液時，是一九四六年九月十四日，星期六。他稱之爲「廣島鷄尾酒」，外表和一杯普通的淸水完全無異。</p>
<p>從此以後，霍爾就天天要驗血，驗尿，驗肺，驗心臟——一共有三十種左右的試驗。星期六過去了，星期日過去了。他並不覺得有什麽異狀。</p>
<p>但是，到了星期一的晚上，他的喉部忽然發腫，咽東西時覺得作痛。星期二，他的頭頸劇痛，祗能吃流質，通夜氣喘難忍。然而，四十八小時後，喉部的腫漲已消，頭頸痛也停止了。</p>
<p>據測量，霍爾的頭頸吸收了第一頓「鷄尾酒」的百分之三十五。經不斷服用後，他的甲狀綫完全破壞，腎部的瘤腫部份倒大量地吸收起來。但肝和腎平時也能吸收一點碘，所以也許會受不良的影響—不過這種壞反應却迄未發現。</p>
<p>霍爾自己對這次診療也極感興趣，他欣然說已經是再世爲人了。他現在已開始服甩大量的放射性碘，比較起在比基尼島受過原子彈試騐的兎羊之類來，他的放射性已經有過之而無不及了。</p>
<h3>避諱</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>名字不過是一符號，爲便於識別而已。故設有人呌「阿猫」，亦決不能禁止別人不能再呌「阿猫」，此理極明。然而從前我國不但所謂御名須「敬避」；即后名，王子名，公主名等亦都在「敬避」之例；於是好端端一個被人用慣的名，只好用他名代替，這實在是專制得無可理喩的。且有一改之後，至今還用着這名的，現舉若干例來談談：</p>
<p>富陽草紙，人人知之，富陽本名富春，因梁簡文帝鄭后名「阿春」，故以「陽」易「春」。野雞原名雉，只因漢高祖呂后諱「雉」，故史記封禪書謂「野雞夜鴝」。當時論語幸還不在搜求遺書之例，否則鄉黨所載「山梁雌雉」豈不是亦要改作「山梁雌野雞」麼？二十之數，今並稱「念」，二十是一用慣的數名字，何以改作「念」，則因吳主女諱「二十」故。馬桶本稱虎子，因唐祖諱「虎」，故只得把虎子改做「馬子」，到宋朝又改稱馬桶，則更可笑了。還有，我們小百姓向官廳有所呈請時，如得批語「姑准」二字，則必大喜，因這一「姑」儘管可「姑」下云了。反之，倘得批「所請不准」或「　難照准」，則無有不大失所望，或想再走門路。但這「准」當作「準」。水至平，故應從水旁，史記有平準書可證。現在把這字改作「准」，且邊旁少寫一點，以別於「淮」字，此始於南齊，因宋順帝諱「準」，故史皆作「准」，今已習用而不知其誤了。</p>
<p>傳統的避諱上，還有所謂避「嫌名」的，即音近的字亦須避，於是連古人亦要改姓！例如漢宣帝諱詢，「荀」「詢」音近，戰國時的荀卿，只好硬派他改姓「孫」。漢明帝諱莊，莊子只好改姓「嚴」，於是以老莊爲「老嚴」，眞不成話。光武的故人嚴子陵亦本姓「莊」呀。像我本姓沈，因五代時福建有個割據的王審知，「審」「沈」音近，遂去沈的水旁，變成一個沒點的一尢」字，把牠作爲　姓，直到現在。</p>
<p>還有士大夫自避家諱的。像司馬遷父名談，文帝時有個太監呌趙談的，那位太史公老實不改氣地把趙談改名「同」，見史記，此種例亦不勝舉。</p>
<h3>記何浩華</h3>
<p>— 大轉</p>
<p>昨見本報訊：「我國世運隊中廿九日又添一員猛將，何浩華已自故鄕鹿特丹抵倫敦，參加個人及集體自由車賽。」不勝欣喜。讀者諸君，或恐對何君不甚熟悉，頤略述之。</p>
<p>何君現年約三十三歲，原籍廣東，西文名字爲Hoeard　Wing，世居荷蘭鹿特丹，故鹿特丹已可視爲他的第二故鄉。他在該埠經營商業，爲當地華僑中知名之士，自幼即酷愛運動，尤於自由車駕駛一項，更具深嗜，十七八歲時，已在當地自由車比賽中，爭得冠軍，其後並獲全荷自由車賽總錦標。</p>
<p>當一九三六年第十一屆世運會舉行於德京柏林前，荷蘭全國自由車總協會願將何君加以訓練，邀請爲彼邦代表，出席世運惟何君本於愛國熱忱，不願爲他人作嫁，故早已疊向祖國駐荷公使館輸誠，請由金問泗公使於一九三五年八月間馳函來華相商，後得吾國政府核准，允爲指派爲世運自由車錦標賽代表，約定逕往柏林，會集出席。</p>
<p>同年八月六日下午六時，何君乃以祖國身份，參加千公尺自由車爭先賽預賽，海外僑胞，一且能爲祖國効勞，當然是非常欣幸的。可惜在第五週賽中，遇到前一屆世運自由車冠軍，何君僅以距離一公分之差，而被淘汰。但他實力雄厚，技術精湛，在這次競賽中，已盡了最大的努力。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰爆發，荷蘭首當其衝，當然受到納粹極大的摧殘，刦後餘生，何君居然又以我國選手資格，翩然蒞臨英京，翹首西望，歡聲雷動，各國男兒，方騁馳角逐，不肯讓人，敬祝何君雄勁勝昔，一顯身手，爲國爭光！</p>
<h3>復飲二章</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>酒如軟媚人，相處最易狎，溫冷間最昏，到口怡然適，倚之以爲命，積久莫自察，喜怒失眞幸，太阿成倒掣，奄忽損精元，茲於病不測；醫者衆口儆，遂亦生怖惻！奈何再世魂，挑燈復偸酌？四體流甘芳，視前意更恰。嗟哉遠小人，附骨蛆難削，使我十天下，酒亦後庭客，盈盈沒骨花，斜陽剩幾尺！</p>
<p>烈烈女貞紅，冶蕩燕支　，奚必化神　，常恐乾坤陷，獨酌撫燈波，懷古懷在念！醇酖忽自甘，妒烏本善議，馬足掛長瓶，出入影相監，昔盛英明姿，蕭瑟爲誰减？把手望蓬萊，海水淸可驗，夜凉月孤明，轉傷勳業暫。躑躅復沉湎，魂殢楊花店，旄頭懸太白，一揮心所憚，莫唱大風歌，攬鏡發悲歎！</p>
<h3>誠實的代價</h3>
<p>— 巾凡</p>
<p>一位太太把錢袋忘記在一輛出差汽車上，正想趕去拿時，那個車夫已經追着送來了。太太很感激，想酬謝他，但是那車夫却堅決拒絕酬勞。</p>
<p>「不過，我想問一個很失禮的問題，」車夫說：「你那個錢袋中一共有多少錢？」</p>
<p>那位太太吿訴了他。他便從袋中挖出一本簿子，簿子上已經記了一長串數目字。他把那位太太告訴他的數目也記了上去。然後他慢慢地說：「我要計算一下：做一個誠實人，一共倒底要損失多少銅錢。」</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆</h3>
<p>— 禹壽</p>
<p>豪食，以粵人爲第一，故比較各地筵席之價格，無能出粵菜右者，雖典重之京朝派，亦瞠乎其後。</p>
<p>十五年前，嘗於北平見「仿膳」所制滿漢全席菜單（書以紅綾，琉璃廠書商多裱爲尺頁出售），當時號稱爲最貴族之飲食，其特品，如佛手燕菜淸燉魚唇紅燒　乾桂花魚翅等，今在春明館等處割裂出售，每　尙須千餘萬金，全席八十三品（包括果粥點心等），不失爲壯麗矣，若持以與同時廣州謨觴館之大漢全席相較，則又寒酸異常。謨觴館菜單，合點心蔬果不過五十餘品，而時値需四百圓，「仿膳」席價則不出百圓，故就售價之低昂以比較其富麗之程度，京朝派非粵派敵也。謨觴館菜單，列淸燉態掌燴白鶴絲燴金錢豹等　之名，矞麗亦爲仿膳之所未至，此則選材之異型，不足爲遜色之證。</p>
<p>今日在北平考訂最貴族之飲食，非豐澤園，非春明館，亦非所謂「公園董事會」，而仍屬於粵人之私庖，如時流　稱之譚家菜關家菜，皆謨觴館作風也。</p>

<p>— 倪秋平</p>
<p>不久以前，豐子愷先生同我去訪梅蘭芳博士，那天豐先生竭力勸梅博士拍五彩電影，現在這件事實現了，在七月二十九日晚上已經正式開拍。這不但滿足了豐先生的希望，也是一般關心伶王的人士們所盼望的。</p>
<p>五月廿八日晚上，曾作第一度試拍，拍的是霸王別姬舞劍一幕；六月廿一日晚上，又試拍了生死恨驚夢的一幕。兩次的試驗增加了不少的經驗。試映時，大家認爲滿意，不但錄音清晰，那光綫和顏色也不讓舶來電影專美於前。那是顏鶴鳴君幾年來努力的成績。</p>
<p>關於劇本，是由梅博士親自和費穆先生幾度商討後決定的，因爲生死恨一劇，是描寫亡國的悲哀的，故事曲折動人，在舞台上是盡人皆知的梅劇名作。現在就由費先生改編，而且親自導演。</p>
<p>這本電影用新的技巧，而保留着舊劇的精華，並不是將台上的戯搬在銀幕上；它綜合了電影和舊劇的長處，稱之謂新的創作，也無不可。</p>
<p>現在正式開拍了，—先已經在梅宅排練了多次。第一夜便順利地完成了柴房勸逃那緊要的一塲。在這一塲，有流水板，搖板，和很重要的對白，情緒是很緊張的。畫面富圖案美，柴房裏堆了零亂的柴，窗前點了一對蠟台，窗外是月亮。蠟台吹滅了，剩下了餘燼未滅的烟，襯托着月光，象徵着韓玉娘（戯中主人）的命運。幾個遠近與角度不同的鏡頭，在費先生指導之下，迅速地拍好了。天氣雖熱，大家都不覺得累，個個人興高采烈地工作。尤其是我，更覺得非常興奮，在這個機會裏能跟隨伶王與我素所欽佩的費穆先生，還有我的先生王少卿，一起工作，這實在是我引以爲榮的事。〔編者按：本文作者倪秋平先生係梅博士二胡琴師。〕</p>
<p>工作完畢之後，在微風裏，一行人乘着車在晨曦中回到了梅宅。大家在笑聲裏作暫時的休息，這時候才覺得倦了。</p>

<h3>Assisting in the Revival of Rural China: Exchange of Notes Between China and the U.S. in Beijing This Morning; Five-Member Committee to be Officially Established</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The exchange of notes between China and the United States regarding the Joint Committee on Rural Reconstruction in China, as stipulated in the U.S. aid program for China, will be signed and exchanged by Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Stuart at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 5th. According to the provisions of this exchange of notes, the committee, composed of two American experts appointed by President Truman and three Chinese experts appointed by President Chiang, will be formally established. Under the guidance and management of Mr. Raymond Brooks, ten percent of the income from the sale of U.S. aid materials will be used to formulate and implement a plan for rural reconstruction in China, including necessary research and training activities. However, this work will only be supported by this U.S. aid program until the funds are exhausted.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Executive Yuan approved on the 4th the exchange of notes regarding the Joint Committee on Rural Reconstruction stipulated in the U.S. loan. It is reported that the chairman of the Joint Committee will be a Chinese national, and Yan Yangchu has been internally appointed. An American, Mr. Ravenholt, will also be a member. However, the appointment of the members is made by the President, so after the exchange of notes is signed, the committee can be established after the President issues the appointment order. Our reporter recently interviewed Mr. Yan to ask for his opinions on rural reconstruction. Mr. Yan humbly stated that the selection of committee members has not yet been finalized, and he does not intend to make any statements. However, regarding the name of rural reconstruction, he said: "Rural reconstruction should be changed to 'village construction' because the scope of villages is larger than that of rural areas, and our rural areas have never been prosperous in the past, so how can there be reconstruction?" Furthermore, the English translation should also be "village construction." Regarding the use of this loan, Mr. Yan believes that it should be used appropriately and its effectiveness should be fully utilized. He hopes that it can be used for the people and that key areas should be selected for implementation first. The reporter then asked whether it would be used exclusively for land reform, agricultural production, water conservancy, etc. Mr. Yan replied in the negative. Village education is also important and is one of the objects of use.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Raymond Brooks and his party of ten left Beiping by plane at 8:30 a.m. on the 4th, flying to Qingdao and then to Beijing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Raymond Brooks arrived in Beijing at 5:01 p.m. on the 4th after flying from Beiping via Qingdao, preparing to attend the Sino-U.S. exchange of notes ceremony on agricultural reconstruction in China to be held in Beijing on the morning of the 5th. It is reported that Mr. Raymond Brooks will go to Shanghai in the next few days.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The first batch of emergency cotton allocation of U.S. aid cotton, totaling 13.7 million U.S. dollars, has been approved for use by the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration. This amount can purchase 70,378 bales of cotton. Citibank, Chase, Guaranty Trust, and other banks have opened letters of credit and will report to customs in the next few days. It is expected that goods can begin to be picked up within ten days. It is learned that the second batch of U.S. aid cotton, totaling 33.7 million U.S. dollars, has also been approved for use by the Economic Cooperation Administration. After receiving the news, the Central Bank has telegraphed our technical advisor in the United States to negotiate the procedures with the letter of credit bank designated by the Economic Cooperation Administration.</p>
<h3>Implementation of the Aid-China Plan to be Negotiated in Beijing Soon; Stillman to Return to China This Weekend</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Stillman, head of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's technical survey team in China, will return to Nanjing this weekend to begin negotiations with the Chinese government on the plans that the Economic Cooperation Administration will fund under the Aid-China plan. After arriving here yesterday, Stillman discussed China's construction plans with Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman and other officials of the agency. He will bring with him clear instructions when he returns to China as a guide for future negotiations. These negotiations will be conducted by Raymond Brooks, director of the China Branch of the agency. Stillman told reporters that they are quite clear about the situation in China, and the purpose of his return to Washington is to assist in making decisions on the many plans proposed by Chinese officials and non-officials. As for the claim that he brought back a list of plans to be implemented as soon as possible for the Economic Cooperation Administration to approve, it is inaccurate. Stillman also declined to disclose the contents of his report to the officials here. This report, like other reports by American officials on China, is full of secrecy. He emphasized that if there is any report on China's construction plan, then the report will be a joint report issued by the China U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Administration after detailed and full discussion and negotiation. Stillman replied to reporters' questions that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway did request 20 million U.S. dollars for repairs, and the request is under consideration. As for whether any plans north of the Yangtze River are also under consideration, he could not say: "I indicated that the Economic Cooperation Administration must first decide on a policy for this type of plan and then discuss it with China." The reporter also asked about the construction plans in North China, and he replied: "These plans are now under careful consideration." He admitted that the war in the area is clearly related to the delay in the implementation of these plans. As for the general possibility of the Economic Cooperation Administration implementing China's construction plans, he explained that the possibility of implementation varies from region to region, which clearly refers to the political and military situation in various regions. He mostly avoided answering questions such as when a certain plan will be implemented and how much it will cost. When discussing official and non-official plans, he said: "We have asked both parties to explain their needs and will not favor any one party." Regarding the report that the Economic Cooperation Administration has already approved privately-run occupations, he did not comment. He said that the policy for purchasing industrial raw materials and equipment required for construction plans is still to be drafted. As for whether the state will purchase them without going through private trade channels, he also refused to explain. He only said: "This remains to be agreed upon with China." He further discussed the issue of China's cooperation, saying: "We have indeed obtained China's cooperation and expect the Chinese government to fully cooperate." Stillman concluded by saying that the cost of the plans proposed by Chinese people is two or three times greater than the 60 million U.S. dollars allocated in the 275 million U.S. dollar Economic Aid to China plan, so these plans must be reduced to be commensurate with the funds that can be used.</p>

<h3>End of Party Affairs Forum: Important Suggestions for Reform Work, to be Submitted to the Central Standing Committee for Formulation of a Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Kuomintang Party Affairs Forum, held for two consecutive days, concluded on the afternoon of the 4th. The theme of this forum was to discuss the reform of party affairs. The attending Central Committee members and Legislative and Supervisory Committee party members made frank and straightforward criticisms of the successes and failures of past party affairs and put forward several important suggestions for the reform of party affairs in the future. They almost unanimously believed that the improvement of the party was a matter of urgency. At the end of the meeting on the 4th, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng summarized the opinions of the committee members and stated that these opinions would be organized by the Central Secretariat and submitted to the Central Standing Committee for the formulation of a plan, which would then be submitted to the Director-General for approval. The original text of Secretary-General Wu's report is as follows: This forum has yielded many valuable opinions. Many of these opinions are consistent among the comrades, such as: (1) strengthening the shared beliefs and mutual trust of comrades, and enhancing the revolutionary spirit and work enthusiasm of party members; (2) establishing a new work style for the party, earnestly implementing new guidelines, and using new appeals to strengthen the people's belief in the party; (3) the party should truly represent the interests of the people, thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and ultimately accomplish the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation; (4) selecting new cadres, reorganizing party departments at all levels, refreshing personnel organization, and cultivating new forces for the party; (5) effectively managing party members in government, urging them to implement the ideology and policies, and exert the party's leadership; (6) recruiting a large number of farmers, workers, youth, and intellectuals into the party to serve as the main force of the revolution; (7) conducting property registration for party members, eliminating corrupt elements, and preserving the party's revolutionary nature and purity; (8) the party's reform must be integrated with practical military, political, and economic reforms; the party's reform must make it a driving force for political reform, but political reform is the concrete manifestation of the party's reform. The above points are generally consistent opinions, but there are also some other important issues where comrades have different views, and consensus needs to be reached through further detailed discussion by the General Directorate:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of factions within the party, some advocate that factions must be completely eliminated to rebuild a party with unified will and concentrated power, while others advocate that under the principle of one leader and one ideology, groups with different political views may be recognized to carry out reasonable activities, divide labor and cooperate, and enable them to compete and promote progress. (2) Regarding the issue of the party's social base, some advocate that the party should represent a certain social class, especially farmers, workers, and revolutionary young intellectuals, while others believe that the party represents the entire people and cannot strictly define representing the interests of a certain class. (3) Regarding the issue of party member registration, some comrades advocate that party members should be re-registered to strictly eliminate corrupt elements, while others believe that after the merger of the party and the corps, a general registration of party members and corps members has already been carried out, and although it has now ended, it can be continued without the need for a new round of registration. In addition, there are various other valuable opinions, which the Secretariat has recorded one by one and submitted to the Director-General for review, and plans to distribute them to all comrades for reference and study. Those who have not yet expressed their opinions or have not had the opportunity to speak are requested to send them to the Secretariat in writing as soon as possible. If comrades who have already spoken have unfinished thoughts or are concerned that the Secretariat's records are not good and may have lost the original meaning, please also submit them in writing as a supplement, and they will be compiled and reported to the Director-General.</p>
<p>This forum was held after the first session of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan adjourned. The Central Government deeply felt the importance and urgency of how to communicate the opinions of responsible comrades of the party's power organs and the party comrades of the state policy-making organs after the implementation of the Constitution. Therefore, a forum was specially held to humbly listen to feedback and solicit the opinions of Central Committee members and Legislative and Supervisory Yuan committee members in Beijing as an important basis for the party's reform plan. This forum is of great significance. The Director-General has repeatedly given instructions, expressing the determination to reform the party. The Central Standing Committee has also conducted research and discussion. However, due to the short time, it was not possible to conduct a detailed discussion. Moreover, many Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and comrades have already left Beijing. If there is an opportunity in the future, it is hoped that another forum can be convened to solicit the opinions of all comrades on the materials compiled from this forum. This party reform movement has been prompted by the times and the environment. Both domestic and foreign parties expect the reform of this party very much. Only the reform of the Chinese Kuomintang can bring new strength and save the crisis of the country and the nation. The domestic and international situation no longer allows this party to hesitate and waver. Therefore, this reform movement can only succeed and cannot fail. This party affairs forum is constructive and proactive. The large number of participants and the enthusiastic and frank speeches of the comrades show that the comrades care about the future of the party. This gives the party reform movement unlimited strength. It is believed that the party reform movement will have a bright future and will definitely produce results.</p>
<h3>New Economic and Financial Policy Plan to Be Discussed by the Executive Yuan the Day After Tomorrow; Financial Portion to Be Announced and Implemented First</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The new economic and financial policy plan of Weng Wenhao was still not submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on the 4th. According to sources close to Weng, it is still being finalized. The Executive Yuan will hold a special meeting on the 7th, and it may be submitted for discussion at that time. It is also learned that the financial portion of the plan will be announced and implemented first. After the effectiveness has been observed, the other portions will be implemented one by one. Regarding the portion of the plan that regulates the inspection of banks, it is rumored that the number of the existing 6,000 banks will be reduced to 2,000. The intention is not as simple as imagined; if they do not comply with the regulations, they will be subject to closure, but there will be no one-time closure or other abrupt measures. After the Executive Yuan meeting on the 4th, it was once rumored that Weng's cabinet's new economic and financial policy plan would be announced at 4 pm, but it was quickly proven to be a false rumor. Since the publication of the editorial "Reforming the Economic Hub" in the Central Daily News on the 2nd, the serious proposition to regulate banks has attracted close attention from public and private banks in the capital. They are constantly inquiring about the contents of the plan and when it will be implemented. The number of telephone inquiries received by various newspapers is almost overwhelming. The banks have obviously entered a war of nerves due to the government's impending measures.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Finance, as of recently, a total of 5,912 public and private banks and money shops have been established nationwide, including 2,090 head offices and 3,822 branches. The detailed figures are as follows: (1) 7 national banks, with 868 branches; (2) 30 provincial bank head offices, with 1,121 branches; (3) 566 county and city bank head offices, with 232 branches; (4) 207 commercial bank head offices, with 1,113 branches; (5) 139 money shop head offices, with 108 branches; (6) 16 trust company head offices, with 17 branches; (7) 225 insurance company head offices, with 363 branches.</p>

<h3>Do Not Forget the Close Relationship Between China and Siam</h3>
<p>The anti-Chinese movement in Siam has not only not stopped, but seems to have intensified recently. As many as 270 Chinese schools have been closed, causing more than 20,000 Chinese children and young people to lose their schooling and thousands of Chinese teachers to lose their jobs. The Chinese government has repeatedly negotiated with the Siamese government, but has not achieved concrete results. Unexpectedly, while this outstanding issue has not yet been resolved, the Siamese Ministry of Interior has accused the Chinese Kuomintang of engaging in political activities in Siam as an infringement on Siam's national sovereignty. Even Siamese soldiers advocate strictly prohibiting overseas Chinese from entering the country, and the Siamese parliament will also resolve to reduce the quota from 10,000 to 5,000. All of this can be seen as the Siamese authorities' disregard for the diplomatic relations between China and Siam. In addition to hoping that our government will negotiate and argue on the basis of reason, we also hope that the Siamese government will remember its roots, not forget the contributions of overseas Chinese to the founding of Siam, and arbitrarily destroy and oppress them.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, without China, how could Siam have its present state? The relationship between the Chinese and Siamese peoples dates back to thousands of years before the establishment of Siam. Western historians such as R.S. Wood have said: "The Siamese and Chinese people are of the same ethnic group. In prehistoric times, the two ethnic groups must have had the same origin." The ancestors of the Siamese people were called the Dai people in China, who were the Bai Pu in the Spring and Autumn period, and the descendants of the Yi barbarians. Since the Han and Tang Dynasties, they have been attached to China. Since the twelfth year of Yongping of Emperor Ming of Han, through Emperor Wen of Wei, Emperor Gaozong of Tang, Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Wenzong, Emperor Yizong, and Emperor Lizong of Song, for more than a thousand years, the Dai people have continued their lineage under the wings of the broad-minded spirit of benevolence of the Han people. The southern expedition of Emperor Shizu of Yuan then prompted the Dai people to expand into the Indochinese Peninsula, thereby establishing the Sukhothai Dynasty and creating today's Siam.</p>
<p>Further reading of the history of the three Siamese dynasties reveals that the hero most worshiped by the Siamese people was Ramkhamhaeng of the Sukhothai Dynasty, that is, Rama Mahathiraj, and this great king frequently paid tribute to China and invited Chinese workers to Siam. Since then, our overseas compatriots have gone there in a steady stream, developing Siam's industry and mining. They originally sowed rice on the soil and left it to fate. Our overseas Chinese taught them how to cultivate, and they had three harvests a year, becoming a rice-producing country. Today, their first export is rice. Speaking of art and culture, how could they not rely on the power of overseas Chinese to spread it? Ramkhamhaeng made his third visit to China in the fourth year of Dade during the reign of Emperor Chengzong, bringing many Chinese artistic workers with him, introducing the Chinese method of pottery making, and creating "Song Jia Yuan" porcelain, which is still treasured today.</p>
<p>The builder of the Bangkok Dynasty, Zheng Zhao, was 100% Chinese. He served in the Siamese court as a young man, and accumulated merit to become the governor. In the thirty-second year of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the Ayutthaya Dynasty of Siam was destroyed by Mang Ji Jue, the son of Ong Ji Ya, the king of Burma. Zheng Zhao rose up in response to the times, calling for the restoration of the country, leading warships up the Chao Phraya River, breaking the great city, killing the Burmese general Su Geli, and triumphantly returning to the old capital. The Siamese people rejoiced throughout the country, and honored this overseas Chinese hero as the King of Siam. He then successively quelled the various tribes, unified the country, conquered Cambodia, and expanded the territory, and was loved by the Siamese people.</p>
<p>Today, at least tens of millions of those who call themselves Siamese have Chinese ancestry. As King Rama VII of Siam said: "The blood of the Siamese people has been mixed with that of the Chinese people, and cannot be separated. Most of the senior officials of Siam, whether in the past or now, are of Chinese descent. Even I myself contain Chinese blood." Indeed, today there are countless officials in the Siamese court and magnates in the opposition who have Chinese ancestry. Even Luan Bilibo, the Siamese elder who was in power after the victory and has now fled, is actually Chinese. When he came to China the year before last, he himself repeatedly said that he was from Chaozhou, Guangdong.</p>
<p>The Chinese have written a glorious history for Siam. Of course, we do not seek gratitude, but unexpectedly, Siam has forgotten its roots. Rama V cut off relations with us after paying tribute in the fourteenth year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. In the second year of Xuantong, Rama VI treated overseas Chinese harshly, causing a general strike in Bangkok. Since then, anti-Chinese sentiment has been unleashed and cannot be restrained. From treating overseas Chinese with courtesy, it has turned into mistreating overseas Chinese, and even discriminating against overseas Chinese as "Jews of the East."</p>
<p>Since Siam established the "Immigration Bureau" in the 17th year of the Republic of China, anti-Chinese sentiment has become more and more intense. In the summer of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the "Bangkok Revolution" broke out, overthrowing the Rama VII royal regime. The following year, another "Second Revolution" broke out, purging the old-fashioned elements who were pro-British and pro-German, and turning to be pro-Japanese. In order to carry out its conspiracy to "appease Siam" in its southward policy, Japan took the opportunity to provoke the feelings between China and Siam, and made a major propaganda to Siam: "Overseas Chinese in Siam account for more than one-third of the Siamese population, and the entire economic machine of Siam is in the hands of the Chinese. Many people also have land rights. If these three problems are not resolved, Siam will have no opportunity for development for one day... " The Siamese authorities believed this and disregarded the traditional friendship between China and Siam, and repeatedly promulgated harsh regulations. In the field of overseas Chinese education, there were "Primary Education Regulations" and "Private School Regulations," which strictly limited Chinese from sending their children to official schools to learn Siamese, forced overseas Chinese schools to change to teaching Siamese, and added teaching Siamese geography and history. The principals had to be proficient in Siamese, otherwise they would be fined and imprisoned.</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Republic of China, a coup d'état took place in Siam. Luan Pibun, the leader of the young military officers, the current ruler who has made a comeback, in order to please the people, did not hesitate to advocate "nationalism," staging a tragedy of anti-Chinese and Chinese-restricting, to win over the people. When our war of resistance against Japan broke out, the struggle between our overseas descendants of the Yellow Emperor and the Japanese invaders and traitors became increasingly fierce. Japan then instigated Luan Pibun to change the country's name to "Thailand," showing its great ambition towards China, so that Siam distorted nationalism and came with the arrogant fascist politics. The patriotic and innovative argument was transformed into an anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese trend. Overseas Chinese became their "imaginary enemy," and the chairman of the chamber of commerce, Yi Guangyan, was finally assassinated by thugs in this anti-Chinese trend. Following the rehearsal of the "September 22" police massacre of overseas Chinese, we were oppressed and demonstrated against, and acted arbitrarily to the end. From small-scale conflicts, it turned into large-scale killings. The dead were wronged and their grievances were not redressed, and the living were displaced. The fate of the three million overseas Chinese in Siam faced the threat of death. Afterwards, "Thailand" was changed back to Siam, and it seemed that it relaxed a little on overseas Chinese, but the harsh regulations on overseas Chinese education remained unchanged. Overseas Chinese schools were barely opened in large cities, and they were still unable to open their doors in small villages and counties. After the coup, Luan Pibun, the famous executioner of anti-Chinese, took the stage again, so that the overall closure of overseas Chinese schools and the repatriation of overseas Chinese students to their home countries have become the current situation.</p>
<p>We have completely forgotten the close history, close geographical location, exchanged blood, and mutually beneficial economy between China and Siam, and we cannot but express infinite regret. In fact, even if the Siamese are forgetful, for the sake of peace in East Asia and for their own safety, they should not ignore the diplomatic relations between China and Siam. And in the Chinese government, so far there has not been any serious diplomatic action, watching our overseas compatriots being devastated and suppressed, which is also something that surprises us!</p>
<h3>President Cables Chairman of Hunan and Members of Provincial Assembly to Pay the Real Tax and Borrowing Quota as Scheduled; Cheng Qian Replies, Requesting to Send Senior Officials with Funds to Investigate the Disaster</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 4th] The President recently cabled Cheng Qian, Chairman of Hunan Province, and the Provincial Assembly that the real tax and borrowing for the 37th year of the Republic of China in Hunan should still be paid according to the quota. After receiving the cable, Cheng was very worried because the current floods have spread to 37 counties, and only one-tenth or two-tenths of the grain production in the lake area remains. The flood situation continues to rise, and the disaster area will continue to expand. In addition to replying that he would do his best to handle it, he also requested that senior officials be sent to Hunan with huge sums of money to investigate the disaster. According to the person in charge of the Farmers' Association, the floods in Hunan are serious, and all parties are calling for tax reduction and exemption. However, since Song Wen called for rent reduction and exemption, in areas where early rice has been harvested, landlords have used extremely strict measures to urge the collection of early rice rent. The disaster victims in Yiyang, Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, and other places are overwhelmed. The Provincial Farmers' Association is planning to formulate rent reduction principles to the Provincial Authorities to save tenant farmers from the floods.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Cheng Qian, who is in charge of Hunan for the first time, announced the replacement of the commissioners of the 5th and 9th districts. Hu Bayue is the commissioner of the 5th district, and Chen Shi is the commissioner of the 9th district.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] Regarding the request of Hubei Province to exempt this year's real tax and borrowing, the President recently replied to the Provincial Government, ordering it to pay the full amount according to the original quota. He also encouraged the Provincial Assembly to assist in promoting and sharing the difficulties together to achieve the complete success of suppressing the rebellion.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 4th] The Changchun Municipal Assembly held a standing committee meeting on the 3rd, which was the first formal meeting of the assembly after Changchun was besieged by bandits. In his speech, Zheng Dongguo emphasized that food is the most serious problem in Changchun today.

<h3>Qingdao's Five U.S. Military Housing Units; U.S. Only Has Leasehold Rights</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 4th] Regarding the sale of five U.S. military housing units in Qingdao, namely No. 9, Shanhai Pass Road, No. 1, Taipingjiao 1st Road, No. 1, Guangxi Road, and Nos. 6 and 7, Lanshan Road, the Executive Yuan had ordered the Municipal Government to issue ownership certificates. According to the Central Trust Bureau's letter stating the transfer situation, the Municipal Government issued temporary management certificates. The Executive Yuan recently decided to postpone the transfer of Nos. 6 and 7, Lanshan Road, as they are related to national defense. Since the land in Qingdao is owned by the city, it is planned to grant the United States leasehold rights to the above three properties, and not to sell the land ownership.</p>
<h3>Changchun Garrison Enthusiastically Donates Money; "Poverty Relief" Turns into "Saving the Dying"</h3>

<h3>Measures Formulated to Handle Land in North China; North China Land Handling Committee Established</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters News: The North China Land Handling Committee was formally established on the 1st, with Zhou Beifeng as the chairman. The draft of the simplified rules for handling land problems formulated a few days ago has been officially named "Implementation Measures for Land Handling in the North China Pacification Zone." The regulations stipulate that land handling in this area will be carried out by farmers' associations composed of self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers, supervised by governments at all levels under the supervision of the Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Therefore, the North China Land Handling Committee will become the executing agency for handling land problems in North China. The difference between this land plan and the overall land reform plan of the Central China Pacification Zone is the method of collecting land price donations to support self-cultivating farmers. Half of the land price donations collected will be used to support self-cultivating farmers and organize cooperative farms. The remaining one-third will be used as the tax on the land being collected during the period of land price compensation. This will prevent tenant farmers who have been allocated land from being unable to repay the land price.</p>

<h3>Siamese Police Suddenly Arrest Overseas Chinese; Fifty-One People Accused of Illegally Seeking Funds; Another Thirteen People Accused of Organizing Secret Societies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 4th] Siamese police recently unexpectedly rounded up 64 overseas Chinese. Although both Chinese Communist and Nationalist personnel are among them, observers here believe that this move is to prevent the Communists from imitating the Malaysian story and launching a rebellion. Siamese police claimed that they also obtained a large number of documents during the search, including a copy of the party's doctrine of "Soviet Democracy" and a report on the Communist Party's work in Siam. Fifty-one of the arrested overseas Chinese have been formally charged with illegally seeking funds, and the government plans to deport them. The remaining thirteen are accused of organizing secret societies. Siamese newspapers took this opportunity to promote that China wanted to conspire to "swallow Siam." The Chinese News Office then issued the following statement based on this: "The Chinese government's representative in Siam was greatly surprised by this report. This matter is enough to promote the Siamese hatred of China and is harmful to the friendship between the two countries, and the duty of the Chinese government's representative is to maintain friendly relations between the two countries. Zhong Bingqiang (transliteration), the Chinese Consul General in Bangkok, personally visited Major Luan Yotrakakosol, the police chief, to find out the truth about the so-called conspiracy to swallow Siam. The director tried his best to tell the Consul General that he had not found a conspiracy to swallow any country, and said that if there was such a thing, not only the newspaper's report, but the police station would have nipped it in the bud."</p>
<h3>Hankou Flood Risk Period Has Passed</h3>

<h3>Students at Beiping Vocational Schools Oppose Classes; Fighting Erupts at Changbai Teachers College; All Students Issue an Urgent Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] Students from Changbai Teachers College in Northeast China studying in Beiping engaged in mutual assault in the dormitory courtyard on the 4th. Security authorities rushed to the college to mediate upon hearing the news. The students at the scene stated the cause of the fight to the security authorities and reported 18 vocational students who they claimed were disrupting order, forcing classmates to write letters, and opposing classes. Police and military police then searched the premises and found 15 people, including Guan Weishu, and various kinds of reactionary evidence. Along with two students, Li Renshan, who were involved in the conflict at the scene, they were taken to the Beiping Garrison Headquarters and are currently being interrogated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] Since Changbai Teachers College in Northeast China moved to Beiping, the school authorities have been actively planning to resume classes. The acting president of the college summoned all students in Beiping on the 4th to give instructions and report on the resumption of classes. After Acting President Fang finished speaking, a group of vocational students opposed classes and threatened students who supported classes. This provoked opposition from most students who wanted to study peacefully, leading to arguments and then mutual assaults.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] All students of the National Changbai Normal College issued an urgent statement on the evening of the 4th, reporting the actions of 18 vocational students, including Fu Wenzong, explaining the course of events: They stated that the authorities' handling of the aftermath of the July 5th incident was making some headway, and the school's preparations for resuming classes were also about to be implemented. However, the vocational students, in order to achieve their conspiracy to disrupt the school and disturb public order, created topics out of thin air, posted illegal wall posters, opposed the Dean of Students Office, and insulted responsible teachers. When the Dean of Students tried to advise them, they refused to listen and instead held grudges, causing the entire Dean of Students staff to resign in anger. The resumption of classes that the majority of well-behaved students had been looking forward to for a long time was thus reduced to nothing. The vocational students even intensified their actions, guarding the school gate, prohibiting entry and exit, holding one meeting after another, and filling the air with reactionary slogans, causing good students to be insulted and feel ashamed. The students, witnessing this with heartache and unable to bear it any longer, in the interest of stability, studying, and upholding righteousness by putting public interests before family, reported the 18 vocational students, including Fu Wenzong and Ma Fangming, to the security authorities.</p>
<h3>Driven by Poverty and Illness, a Civil Servant in Beiping Dies Tragically by Jumping into a Well</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] A case of a civil servant in Beiping, driven by poverty and illness, committing suicide by jumping into a well has recently occurred. Hu Lianghe, a clerk in the Accounting Office of the Beiping Municipal Government and a native of Xiangshan, Zhejiang, had been working in the Municipal Government for two years.

His colleagues sent him to the hospital for treatment, but all hospitals refused him, citing a lack of available beds. Hu then requested a doctor to treat him in his dormitory in Yueya Lane. Because the Municipal Government still owed him his July salary, he was both ill and worried. The doctor told his friend that his condition was serious, leading him to contemplate death. At 3:30 AM on the 4th, Hu took advantage of people's inattention and jumped into the well in Yueya Lane, committing suicide. After being discovered, he had already been dead for some time. The body has been sent to the funeral parlor, and the Municipal Government's Welfare Committee has allocated 100 million yuan for funeral expenses.</p>

<h3>Sunspot Activity Reaches Its Peak This Year</h3>
<p>Floods in Various Places Are Related to This</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 4th] The Taipei Astronomical Society recently announced that a group of small sunspots appeared on the 2nd at a location 37 degrees north latitude from the sun. The appearance of such high-latitude sunspots, which has never been seen before, indicates that sunspot activity has reached its peak. The number of sunspots will gradually decrease in the future, possibly reaching a minimum around 1953. Sunspot activity increases the amount of solar radiation, which makes rising air currents more active and dramatically increases rainfall. Therefore, the floods in various places this year seem to be related to this peak in sunspot activity.</p>

Although secrecy is being maintained regarding the resumption of negotiations between the three nations and the Soviet Union to discuss the Berlin issue, officials have hinted at an optimistic atmosphere within the government. After holding talks here to protest to the Soviets and planning direct negotiations with Stalin, the three nations' representatives have resumed talks at the British Foreign Office. The U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, and the French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, have both received new instructions from their respective governments and held lengthy discussions with the British Undersecretary of State, Strang, on the afternoon of the 4th, with the aim of exchanging the three nations' governments' views on the results of the meeting with Stalin.</p>

<h3>Poland Opposes West Germany Plan, Lodges Protest with Britain Again, Believes German Problem Should Be Resolved Through Four-Power Consultation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 3rd United Press] Poland has recently lodged a protest with Britain, protesting again the recent three-power conference held to discuss the German problem. The note was delivered to Foreign Secretary Bevin on July 30 by the Polish Ambassador to Britain.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd Dispatch] The publication of the Polish note a few hours after the holding of an important meeting in the Kremlin regarding the Berlin problem is particularly significant. The note stated, "The Polish government believes that coordinated action by the four powers is a just guarantee for a fair resolution of the German problem and security. We firmly believe that the conditions for such a resolution do exist, but the agreements concluded and binding by the four powers regarding Germany must be observed, and subsequent decisions should be made by the institutions mandated to discuss such decisions." The majority of the Polish note continues to criticize the policies of Western nations in the usual manner, accusing them of things like the Marshall Plan "will make participating countries political and economic vassals, and at the same time, there is a tendency to establish pre-war European economic organizations and use them to establish German ruling elements."</p>
<h3>Alert in Soviet Occupation Zone, Berlin Situation Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>[Report] London, 4th Dispatch, Berlin: The situation in Berlin is becoming increasingly tense. Barbed wire is densely spread around Soviet military camps and military residential areas, and armed guards have been increased. According to Germans residing in the Soviet occupation zone, since Berlin citizens attacked Soviet police in the Soviet occupation zone last week, all streets have been blocked, and soldiers are stationed there. At the same time, it is understood that Soviet authorities have made demands on the Berlin City Council that amount to complete control over Berlin and its government's finances and economy. Soviet authorities have declared to the City Council: If the authorities in West Berlin allow the Soviet Union to completely control German banks in the Soviet Union's jurisdiction, funds in the Western sectors can be unfrozen.</p>
<h3>U.S. Implements Plan to Strengthen Navy and Air Force</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The United States' air defense plan was launched in June, with an initial order for 3,316 aircraft using Congressional appropriations. It is expected that this plan will bring aviation into an era of supersonic speeds.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The U.S. Navy Department is currently busy with a plan to strengthen the Navy, adding sixteen new warships and modernizing thirty-one existing warships.

<h3>Soviet Draft of the Danube River Convention is a Reappearance of the Iron Curtain Policy; UN Request to Send Observers to Meeting Denied</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 4th Dispatch] Vishinsky's draft of the Danube River Convention presented to the Belgrade Conference contains the "Iron Curtain" policy consistently used by the Soviet Union towards its vassal states, with the aim of allowing the Soviet Union to monopolize the river. The British opinion is in favor of maintaining the 1921 treaty, and the progress of the conference seems to have been stalled by Vishinsky's interference.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 3rd Dispatch] The United Nations' request for permission to send special observers to the Belgrade Conference has been rejected by the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Nations will be unable to obtain arguments regarding the economic aspects of the Danube River situation at the conference, which are of great value, as the Danube River shipping issue has been included on the agenda of the Economic and Social Council.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 3rd Dispatch] The Danube River Conference held its fourth meeting today, chaired by Romanian Foreign Minister Ms. Pauker. Soviet representative Vishinsky and British representative had an intense debate over whether the 1921 Danube River Convention should be abolished. Baker reiterated that the Convention should continue to be in effect, pointing out that the Soviet Union's failure to participate in the conference at that time was because the Soviet Union had not yet participated in all international activities, and that no one had prevented it from participating in the 1912 Danube River Convention after the Soviet Union began participating in international activities. Vishinsky then delivered a long speech refuting the British representative's arguments and pointing out that the Western countries had already violated the 1921 Convention after the establishment of the 1938 Danube River Convention, so the latter was clearly invalid. Vishinsky also pointed out, "In your European Convention, Nazi Germany actually participated, but the Soviet Union had no seat." He claimed that the Soviet Union had requested to participate in the Danube River Conference in 1934, but it was not allowed for a long time, while Germany was finally allowed to attend. Vishinsky concluded the Soviet Union's position by saying, "Countries far from the Danube River certainly have no right to participate in the committee planning Danube River navigation." At this point, the conference was adjourned and scheduled to continue discussions tomorrow. Tomorrow's meeting will be chaired by the British representative.</p>

<h3>Malayan Communist Party's Attempt to Establish a Republic Thwarted by British Crackdown</h3>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 3rd Dispatch] Malayan Governor General MacDonald said in a national broadcast on the 3rd that the Communist Party had chosen August 3 to establish a Communist Republic of Malaya, but it was thwarted by mass arrests and British military action.</p>
<h3>U.S. Department of Justice Unable to Prosecute Communist Spy Case Due to Lack of Confirmation; Former Communist Chambers Accuses Multiple Spies Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Senior Justice Department officials said on the 3rd that former Communists Miss Bentley and Chambers had reported to the FBI before testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee about the Communist spy case, but after spending $500,000 on investigation for three years, sufficient evidence has still not been obtained to support prosecution. The Justice Department authorities are currently facing two problems: First, the documents that government officials allegedly gave Bentley to be forwarded to Moscow have not been obtained; second, anyone who is accused, if they are guilty, refuses to reveal the inside story and admit their guilt.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Four individuals who once served as "New Deal" officials were identified on the 3rd by former Communist Chambers as important figures in a pre-war Communist underground organization, which was dedicated to carrying out espionage work for the Soviet Union and engaging in subversion of the U.S. government. These four individuals were once heads of the "Young Turks" of the New Deal. Their names are Pressman, Witt, and the Hiss brothers, Alger and Donald. They were accused by Chambers at the House Un-American Activities Committee. According to Chambers, he risked his life to leave the Communist Party in 1937. Chambers has been summoned to the committee to confirm the truthfulness of Miss Bentley's statement last week regarding Communist conspiracies and espionage work. The four individuals identified by Chambers today are the first ones that members of the Congressional committees investigating the Communist spy case have heard of. However, Chambers also identified multiple other "underground elements" that Miss Bentley identified last week, such as former Treasury Secretary White. Chambers, who once said that he did not know Miss Bentley, recently told the committee that Pen Lou, a former Treasury official and Air Force officer accused of being a Soviet spy, was one of the seven Communist "basic leaders" who worked in the government before the war. The other six are Pressman, the Hiss brothers, Kramer, Abbott, and Collins. Chambers also said that Witt was the leader of the underground organization in the Washington area. Witt once served as the Executive Secretary of the National Labor Relations Board. Abbott was once a powerful figure in the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and is now an organizer for Wallace's Progressive Party. The Hiss brothers held important positions in the State Department under the "New Deal" and have resigned from their positions in the past two years. Alger Hiss has now completed his duties as a senior economic and political advisor at the State Department and accompanied the late President Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference. Donald Hiss is now engaged in private legal affairs here. Pressman once served as a legal advisor to the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and later as the Chief Legal Advisor to the Works Progress Administration, resigning in 1937. Chambers supported Miss Bentley's accusation that former Treasury Secretary White cooperated with the underground organization during his tenure as a senior Treasury official. Chambers said that White, Pressman, and Alger Hiss were all members of the "backbone" organization of the Communist Party because they were all positioned within the government.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Sleep: Scientific Research Results Sweep Away Past Misconceptions</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Chicago, 3rd Dispatch] Sleep is one of the great mysteries of human life. Recent scientific research work in the United States has gradually shed light on it. Dr. Kleitman, director of the Sleep Laboratory, can be considered the most knowledgeable person about sleep. He has discovered some basic facts about sleep that can sweep away the misconceptions that are popular around the world today. At the same time, other researchers are also engaged in the study of sleep, viewing it as humanity's most convenient teacher and as a means of treating mental illnesses. After tens of thousands of trials over 25 years, Dr. Kleitman has proven that the common belief that moving the body during sleep is harmful to a night's rest is wrong. On average, everyone moves their body 20 to 45 times during sleep in order to give all parts of the body the opportunity to fully relax. He has also discovered that the 24-hour cycle of sleep and wakefulness can also be changed. He spent several weeks in a dark cave in the mountains, conducting various experiments, and found that if not affected by the cycle of day and night, humans can also have a cycle of 24 or 28 hours. This proves that the determination of this cycle is not based on the body's physiological need to sleep at a specific time. Based on scientific research, he has discovered that the arrival and awakening of sleep often go through six convenient steps, sometimes not very convenient. First, the pulse and heartbeat, and other physiological functions gradually slow down. Then, after a certain amount of time, the five senses gradually disappear, first the sense of hearing, then the sense of taste, then the sense of smell, then the sense of hearing (half of it is lost), and finally the sense of touch. When waking up, the process is the opposite.</p>
<h3>Looking to the Future of Berlin (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Ranshi</p>
<p>The storm in Berlin is not a harbinger of war. The strategy adopted by the Soviet Union in Berlin is currently one of "slowly tightening the noose," not a "lightning war."</p>
<p>American troops will remain stationed in Berlin, and the United Kingdom and France will take the same steps. However, the Soviet Union can take over Berlin at any time it pleases.</p>
<p>The "showdown" in the Berlin situation will likely occur in the winter of 1948. If there is no war, they will not withdraw from Berlin. But even without war, the Soviet Union will become the "master" in Berlin.</p>
<p>Berlin, like an isolated island, is located in the center of the Soviet occupation zone. It is a hundred miles away from West Germany, but all land and water transportation between it and West Germany is controlled by the Soviet Union. Apart from prolonged airlifts to transport supplies needed by Berliners from West Germany to Berlin, there is simply no other way. The game of cards and gestures between the two sides is expected to continue in Berlin. In the near future, the Berlin crisis will subside from a boil.</p>
<p>It seems impossible for the Berlin crisis to lead to war. Indeed, once a war starts, the Western powers will lose their power in Berlin. As for the Soviet Union, there is no benefit to it in a war occurring in a city under its control.</p>
<p>The result of the Berlin crisis may be an agreement between the two sides, with the Western powers allowing the Soviet Union to supply the German people of Berlin, while Western troops can still be stationed in Berlin. In this situation, the Western powers can avoid "retaliatory measures by the Soviet Union against Germans who are pro-Western," that is, the Western powers can protect German individuals who are pro-British, American, and French from suffering retaliatory measures from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At the same time, the turbulence of the Berlin crisis will temporarily subside without being resolved. The Soviet Union may ease the blockade of West Berlin, but this opportunity will only arise after its supplies begin to dwindle. The period when the Soviet Union eases the blockade of West Berlin will be around winter, because that is when Berlin needs coal.</p>
<p>If the Soviet blockade continues or resumes, then the United States, in retaliation, may cut off the supply of Bavarian water and energy to deal with the Soviet occupation zone. Air evacuation of the British, American, and French expatriates in Berlin is very likely. If the crisis becomes more intense, several hardline German leaders will fly out of Berlin, and some German people who prefer to reside in West Germany may also migrate out of the country.</p>
<p>The following events are likely to arise from the Berlin crisis:</p>
<p>Since the series of agreements from September 12, 1945, in which the United States, the United Kingdom, and France accepted the Soviet Union's right to regulate and control land and water transportation between Berlin and the West, the Soviet Union's squeezing of the Western powers in Berlin was expected.</p>
<p>As a result, the Soviet Union was not only able to cut off Berlin's railway, highway, and canal routes to the Western occupation zones, but also the three restricted air routes, which are also severely threatened by the patrols of Soviet fighter planes. The question now for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is how to maintain the real authority to administer the four sectors of Berlin.</p>
<p>The reason for the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is simply to control the city of Berlin, which is about the size of Chicago in the United States. Because Berlin has been the capital of Germany in both World Wars. With such a long history, the Soviet Union very much wants to make Berlin the capital of a communist government in order to control Germany. But the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are hindering this plan.</p>

<h3>Fire at a Warehouse on Zhongzheng East Road; A Large Quantity of Stored Pigments Destroyed; Fire Brought Under Control at 1 a.m. This Morning; Substantial Losses for Gonghelai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A fire suddenly broke out at 11:30 p.m. last night on the second floor of the French-owned Longdong Warehouse, located at No. B, Lane 11, on the Bund of Zhongzheng East Road (i.e., Avenue Édouard VII). Investigations revealed that the premises were mostly leased by the well-known pigment merchant Gonghelai, located at No. 29, Lane 2, Jiangxi South Road, in this city, for use as storage. It is reported that yesterday afternoon, the company had over a hundred barrels of various types of pigments, weighing 15 jin and 25 jin each, delivered to the warehouse, which may have been caused by a careless worker dropping a spark of fire. After the fire started, the building was quite sturdy, and the doors and windows were tightly closed, and the caretaker had left at 5 p.m., so it was not easy for the outside world to notice at the time. By the time the flames burst out of the windows, it was already beyond control. After receiving the report, the Fire Department immediately dispatched pump trucks from the Central, Xinkaihe, and Hongkou districts, which arrived one after another within a few minutes and started spraying water to put out the fire. However, because the doors and windows could not be opened, and the entire second and third floors had already become a sea of fire, rescue efforts were extremely difficult. After some effort, the doors and windows were pried open, and the water was concentrated to put out the fire. By 1 a.m. this morning, the fire was finally brought under control, but most of the pigments stored by Gonghelai on the second floor had been burned, and the rest were stained with water. For Gonghelai alone, the loss has exceeded several hundred billion. The French company Longdong Foreign Firm was originally the Chinese distributor of Three Stars Axe Brandy, but because imports have been restricted early on, the amount of stored goods is very small, and the loss is not large. According to an employee of Gonghelai Pigment Store, the pigments stored were all covered by fire insurance, and only a very small portion belonged to Gonghelai itself; the rest was goods already sold to customers. Also, during the big fire last night, the work of the Associated Press of America was suspended for an hour because it was adjacent to the Longdong Warehouse. The firefighters had not left by 3 a.m. this morning.</p>

<h3>Former Commander of the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai; Kinoshita Arrested Again; Sufficient Evidence of Abusing Allied Personnel</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Major General Kinoshita Eiichi, the former commander of the military police in Shanghai, is said to have committed various atrocities against Allied prisoners of war. He has now been arrested at the request of the British government. Kinoshita was arrested once during the early days of the occupation of Japan, but was released due to insufficient evidence. His re-arrest is the result of discussions between the British Secretary of State for War, Shinwell, and the British judge in Singapore. The location of Kinoshita's trial has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] At the request of the United Kingdom, the occupation authorities arrested Major General Kinoshita on the 4th, who served as the commander of the Japanese Garrison in Shanghai in 1942, because Kinoshita committed brutal crimes in the famous Hashihama Mansion in Shanghai. Sergeant Major Yoshida Sakae, who was subordinate to Major General Kinoshita in Shanghai, was also arrested. According to a British spokesman, he believes that there is now sufficient evidence to accuse the two of responsibility for mistreating more than 20 Allied personnel. These people were subjected to torture and starvation in the Hashihama Mansion prison.</p>
<h3>Informant Colludes with Economic Police; Embezzles Thirty Taels of Gold Jewelry; Police Squad Leader Testifies in Court; Two Fugitive Police Officers Are Highly Suspected; Emphatically States That the Detained Squad Leader Is Honest and Reliable</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Judge Wu Xiangzu of the District Court opened a trial yesterday afternoon for a case of dereliction of duty. A cotton cloth broker named Wu Bofan was acquainted with police officer Zhang Lin. Having heard that he could receive a 30% reward for reporting black market gold and currency organizations, he entrusted his friends Zhou Yunshan and Zhou Kuang to help him inquire about gold and currency trading organizations, hoping to obtain the reward. His brother-in-law Shao Xingnan also participated in the reporting group. Wu then unintentionally heard Tong Xiangxiuquan and Zhou Jingwei talking about the Baokang Silver Store at No. 702, Xinzha Road, engaging in gold and currency trading. He then gathered the Zhou brothers, Xiang Xiuquan, Zhou Jingwei, etc., and opened the Jielu Hotel to discuss the reporting method, deciding that Zhou Yunshan would use the pseudonym Wu Zhen and report to the Economic Police Brigade.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 23 of this year, Squad Leader Wang Shuci of the Economic Police Squad 6 was assigned to lead police officers Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, along with the informants, to the Baokang Silver Store for a search. As a result, they found more than 40 small gold bars and 270 million yuan in legal tender in the store, and a jewelry box containing about 100 taels of gold jewelry upstairs, all of which were sealed by Wang Shuci. At that time, the store employee Shen Guigen protested, saying: "The Social Affairs Bureau has an order that buying and selling gold jewelry is not illegal," and requested the return of the gold jewelry. After Wang considered it, he returned all 100 taels of gold jewelry, but retained the gold bars and legal tender account books. However, the informants Wu Bofan and others thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of the situation, and persuaded Zhang Lin to take 30 taels of gold jewelry from the 100 taels, and only return 70 taels to Baokang Silver Store. The next day, Zhang Lin met with Wu and others at the YMCA in the Western Concession and divided up the 30 taels of gold jewelry for their own use. Later, Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, two economic police officers, fearing that the incident would be discovered, asked for leave from the team and never returned. When Director Yu Shuping received the report, he detained Wang Li Zhang, while the two police officers Zhang and Gao disappeared. According to Wang's confession, Wu Bofan and other six people were arrested one after another, and a portion of the original stolen goods was recovered and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. As a result, a public prosecution was filed. Except for Wang, who was detained, the others were released on bail of 500 million each to await trial.</p>
<p>The District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon and interrogated each defendant one by one. Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the Economic Police Brigade, also appeared in court to testify, stating the details of the case. He expressed his trust in the honesty and reliability of Squad Leader Wang Shuci, and believed that the suspicion against the two police officers Zhang and Gao was serious because they took leave and did not return. Warrants have now been issued for their arrest. The court ordered a postponement for further trial, Wang Shuci was remanded in custody, and the suspects were released on their original bail.</p>

<p>[Report from our Jiangyin correspondent, 4th] Kong Rusheng, 19 years old, from Beimanshui Village, Zhutang, Jiangyin, and his father, Kong Yisheng (also known as A Xiang), used to be the leader of the peasant movement group under the command of the notorious bandit Yu Zaitang, who has been killed. He often engaged in secret activities in Shanghai. On the 14th day of the third lunar month of this year, Kong's father ordered his son Rusheng to take a secret letter, a map, and a "Guoxun" magazine back to Cheng, to be delivered to the bandit army.

He was arrested by the village self-defense team, and letters and other items were found, which involved the bandit's work in great detail. After being interrogated by the county military court, it was learned that his father had been introduced by Yu to work for the bandit army for more than three years and currently lived at No. 13, Jia 9, Bao 3, Xishazhai, Shanghai. According to the confession, the county government sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau to go to the address to arrest Kong Yisheng, who was sent to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation.

<h3>Rong Hongyuan Wins Lawsuit for Return of Deposit for Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Rong Hongyuan of Shenxin Textile Company ordered 3,000 bales of Indian cotton from Gandhi Bial (B.R. Gandhi), an agent of Peichang Foreign Firm, on September 30, 1946, and signed three contracts. Rong paid a deposit of 10% of the total value of the goods, totaling 113,500 rupees. However, since the government announced the amended Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade in November of the same year, cotton imports were restricted, and the order could not be fulfilled, and the contract signed by both parties was terminated due to the inability to deliver the goods. Rong wrote a letter on April 31 of this year to demand the return of the deposit, but Gandhi claimed that the ordered goods had been sold at a low price and wanted to seek compensation for huge losses from Rong. Rong then filed a lawsuit with the District Court, requesting a judgment to return the principal and interest of the deposit, and providing security to request a preliminary execution. This case was recently decided by the Civil Court of the District Court, with the main text of the judgment stating: "The defendant shall return to the plaintiff 113,500 rupees, and pay the plaintiff interest calculated at an annual rate of 5% from December 31, 1946, until the date of termination of the execution, all of which shall be paid in legal tender converted at the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank on the date of payment. The preliminary execution of this case is approved after the plaintiff provides security of 6 billion legal tender. However, if the defendant provides security of 12 billion legal tender in advance, the preliminary execution shall be waived."</p>

<h3>Wharf Workers of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on Hunger Strike; Negotiations Ineffective and at a Standstill</h3>
<p>Xu Jinzhou, an employee of the First Wharf of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was dismissed from his position by the Wharf Department, which triggered a hunger strike protest by members and non-members of the wharf union. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, representatives of the warehouse workers' branch of the company negotiated with the Wharf Department again, but made no progress. The workers' side is determined to continue the hunger strike to the end, and the situation has reached a standstill.

He was given a dismissal to warn others."</p>

<h3>Finding a Diamond Ring in the Trash; A Fleeting Moment of Joy</h3>
<p>Recently, Zhou Huzhi, a poor scavenger, submitted a letter to Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, claiming that he had found a diamond ring that was illegally confiscated by the police. He appealed for instructions for its return. Zhou Huzhi originally scavenged for trash in the Xiaohuangpu garbage dump in the Si Sheng District of Pudong. On the afternoon of July 26th, he found a diamond ring with four diamonds. At the time, he did not know if it was real or fake. The next day, he and his wife, Chen Zhou Shi, went to the home of their Shanghai friend Sun Defang for a meal. Afterward, they took the diamond ring to the Xiguan Jewelry Company at 294 Jing'an Temple Road to sell it. The shop assistant offered 100 million yuan, so he concluded that it was not a fake and refused to sell it. Later, another shop assistant offered 200 million yuan, but Zhou still refused to sell it. The shop assistant then became aggressive, asking where the ring came from. Zhou told him that he had found it in the garbage dump. However, when Zhou Huzhi left the shop, the shop assistant followed him and reported him to the police officer on duty, who brought him to the Xin Cheng branch bureau. Jiao Guorui of the Judicial Section of the branch bureau interrogated him and kept the diamond ring. Zhou is now very dissatisfied with this and has hired lawyer Yang Junlin to submit a request to Mayor Wu for the return of the diamond ring.</p>

<h3>Factors for Price Increases in Public Utilities Beyond Control of City Authorities; Zhao Huijue Briefs Reporters on the Process of Adjusting Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, held a press conference at the Municipal Government at 5:00 PM yesterday, reporting on the process of adjusting the prices of public utilities for August. He stated that the authorities had made their best efforts to alleviate the rising trend of public utility prices. On August 2nd, when the Public Utilities Bureau convened a price adjustment meeting, they argued with the heads of the various trade associations for over six hours, ultimately reducing the requested multiples by the companies by two to three times. The price increases of public utilities are beyond the control of the municipal authorities. The continuous increase in foreign exchange rates and fuel prices has the greatest impact on the cost of public utilities. Although Mayor Wu decided at the last emergency meeting that the coal and fuel used by public utilities would be settled in foreign exchange once at the beginning of the month, with the funds borrowed from the Central Bank, execution has been difficult. The total amount of goods and education required is approximately 10 trillion yuan, but the Central Bank has reduced the advance amount to 5.5 trillion yuan due to the excessive amount of the advance.</p>
<p>Oil Companies Agree to a One-Time Purchase Reluctantly</p>
<p>Director Zhao continued, "In order to stabilize oil prices for public utilities, Mayor Wu convened the heads of the various oil companies this morning (i.e., yesterday) to explain the importance of the relationship between public utilities and citizens' lives, and asked for their assistance. After repeated negotiations, the companies reluctantly agreed to allow a one-time purchase for public utilities this month, but solemnly declared that it would not be an example for the future. However, the current US dollar exchange rate (with linked exchange certificate) has risen to 6 million yuan, and the amount of oil that the companies can purchase with the loaned funds has been reduced due to the reduction in the amount approved, originally only enough to purchase 20 days' worth of oil, but now the US dollar exchange rate has risen, so it is feared that it will not even reach this amount. It is still unknown how many days' worth of coal can be purchased with the borrowed coal funds. The reason why these price adjustments are calculated from the beginning of the month is to enable public utilities to receive payments early, reduce losses, and prevent the rate of increase from being too high. According to reports from various companies, due to insufficient oil and coal loans and the frequent rise in the US dollar exchange rate, there will still be a significant loss this month. For example, the Shanghai Electric Power Company expects to lose up to 2 trillion yuan in August."</p>
<p>Public Telephone Charges as High as One Million at a Time</p>
<p>Finally, Director Zhao stated that the Public Utilities Bureau is doing its best to consider the burden on citizens, but in the current economic turmoil, when it is difficult for all industries to survive, the only thing the Public Utilities Bureau can do to balance the revenue and expenditure of public utilities is to use the method of graded billing, so that the burden on ordinary people with small users will not be too heavy. The three items of electricity, gas, and telephone have already been piloted, and in the future, it will be extended to others depending on the effectiveness, and the number of low-level charges will be appropriately relaxed.</p>
<p>Later, reporters informed him that although the authorities had approved a charge of 100,000 yuan per public telephone call, some shops and restaurants were actually increasing the price to 500,000 yuan or even 1 million yuan per call for profit. Director Zhao, upon hearing this, believed that there was no reason for this and decided to find a way to ban it.</p>
<p>City Councilors Request Suspension of New Prices</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] City councilors Fei Shusheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shao Yongsheng, and fifty-four others believe that the new prices for various public utilities in the city for August have increased threefold compared to the previous month, which has a profound impact on people's livelihoods. They have jointly telegraphed City Council Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, urging them to convene an extraordinary general meeting as soon as possible. Before the extraordinary general meeting is convened, they request a special letter to the municipal government to suspend the implementation of the various prices announced on the 2nd of this month.</p>

<h3>Workers in Underwear and Thermos Industries Request Change in Wage Payment Method</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] All workers in the city's underwear industry requested that wages be paid according to the current index, as the factory's payment of wages was based on the index for the first half of the month.

<p>All workers in the city's thermos industry requested that wages be calculated according to the current index, as the factory's payment of wages was based on the index for the previous month. The Bureau of Social Affairs is currently mediating.</p>
<p>Strike at Central Machinery Branch Factory Spreads; Workers at Factory No. 1 Also Strike Yesterday; Bureau of Social Affairs Sends Personnel to Mediate</p>
<p>The workers at the First Branch Factory of the China Textile Construction Machinery Company (formerly the Donghua Machinery Factory) in this city have historically been paid on the 5th and 18th of each month. Labor requested that the payment be advanced by one day, as Central Machinery Factory No. 1 (formerly the Toyota Factory) in the same system as the factory paid wages earlier. The factory stated that wage settlement procedures were quite complicated and could not be followed, as payment only happened three days after the announcement of the cost of living index. The workers went on strike the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the factory continued to strike, and the workers at Factory No. 1 (Toyota Factory), which is in the same system as the factory, also expressed support for the workers at the factory and simultaneously stopped working, and the situation gradually expanded. The Bureau of Social Affairs has sent personnel to mediate.</p>

<h3>Wave of Closures in Changzhou; Moral Decay in the Business Community; Secret Opportunistic Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper from Wujin on the 3rd] Recently, there has been a wave of closures in the business community, with lawyer liquidation advertisements filling the newspapers. Starting with Yang Dasheng Rice Mill, others have followed suit, including Lihua Department Store, Lixin Iron Factory, Yukang Oil Shop, Yitai Grain Store, Lianyi Cotton Cloth Store, and Hengda Stone Shop. There are rumors that many other stores are preparing to close down. While some of these closures are due to genuine losses, there are also those who, after failing in speculation, intend to move all the goods out of the store and then declare liquidation. It is rumored in the market that closing down a store is more profitable than opening one, because in closing down a store, a lawyer can be hired to negotiate discounts on debts, and liquidation takes a considerable amount of time. The interest earned in ten days or half a month can offset the principal and profits, resulting in a net profit. As a result, stores are closing down one after another. Morality in the business community has almost completely decayed. The county government has ordered the police bureau to pay close attention and strictly enforce regulations. If caught, they will be prosecuted for disrupting finance.</p>

Therefore, I dare to pour out my heart and sincerely beg you to understand our difficulties and extend your compassion, providing assistance to save us from our predicament. If you do, I will be forever grateful. I remain in desperate anticipation! Respectfully submitted by Zhan Gongtian, August 3rd (Resident of No. 553, Middle Linsen Road, this city).</p>

<h3>No News for Eleven Years - Chen Yuesheng's Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Chen Yuesheng, a native of Hongshan, Wuxi, formerly worked at the Nanjing Central Hospital.  Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he once wrote home saying that he would apply for work with the Ministry of Railways' special military telephone installation.  Whether he withdrew westward with the army or was massacred by enemy invaders in Nanjing remains unknown for eleven years.  Chen's elderly mother has fallen ill from weeping, and his wife has abandoned the home and run away.  The situation is miserable, which is heartbreaking! I earnestly beseech you to bestow a corner to enable Chen's relatives, friends, and colleagues who know his whereabouts to inform us by letter, so as to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Chen Huiqing, No. 299 Hankou Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Market Sentiment Uncertain - Chinese Stocks See Mixed Fortunes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, market sentiment was extremely uneasy about the economic measures that the Executive Yuan would implement, and the process was therefore hazy and uncertain.  Finally, as credit conditions gradually eased, bargain hunters were taking advantage of the low prices, and after falling, it was easier to rebound slightly.</p>
<p>The market opened flat in the morning, with small-cap stocks remaining relatively stable.  Yong Yarn, however, fell to 11,650 yuan.  Numbers 71, 154, 226, 045, 116, 156, 65, 48, 183, 224, and 85 were all bought, rising to 12,100 yuan. Numbers 69, 65, 196, 164, 8, 94, 216, 169, 76, 55, 89, 95, 127 were successively sold off. Yarn and cloth sales were sluggish, and the price was forced down to a low of 11,250 yuan.  Credit conditions eased, and it was rumored that the new economic plan would not be unfavorable to the securities market. Numbers 65, 197, 176, 183, 71, 69, 13, 95, 154, 169, 216, and 190 were actively covered, and around noon, the price had rebounded to a high of 12,150 yuan.  Numbers 95, 180, 207, and 12 closed out, with the midday close at 12,050 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Lian Di rose to the limit, Yonggong Matches fell by half a percent, Sino-French rose by half a percent, and National Goods, China United, Mayling, Tung Yih, Innerwear, and Wah Fung were all flat.  Yong Yarn, Meyer, Sino, and Rong Fung were slightly lower, with the remaining stocks all experiencing small declines.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, Yong Yarn opened at 12,100 yuan. Numbers 176, 65, 148, 89, 190, and 180 rose to 12,320 yuan. Numbers 69, 129, 76, 145, 104, 13, 137, and 153 were sold to 11,850 yuan. Thereafter, due to the uncertain exchange situation, the market price fluctuated. Finally, numbers 56, 196, 219, and 169 and others vigorously bought, and the market closed at 12,030 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Lian Di still rose to the limit, Sino-French, National Goods, Five Harmony, and Wah Fung were all flat, Sino-French, Hsin Yee and Chin Hsing fell by half a percent, Matches rose by half a percent, and the prices of the remaining stocks fluctuated.  The prices of various unlisted stocks in the off-market saw a slight decline.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the eve of economic reform, all sorts of fantasies arose, and the Unified Bonds C opened in the morning at 1.1 million, rising from 1,095,000 to close at 1,260,000. More than 2 million were traded, with Chengde selling, while room 552 and room 500 bought. Compared to the previous close, Classes A, B and E rose by 90,000 yuan, Class C rose by 140,000 yuan, and Grade D rose by 110,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Credit Conditions Change from Stable to Loose - Significant Clearings at Banks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of credit conditions in this city was stable early and loose later. During the afternoon clearing of bills and notes by the money shops, the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a large clearing outflow, totaling 2,737.1 billion.

<h3>National Banks Temporarily Suspend Interbank Term Deposits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Bank previously offered interbank term deposits to absorb idle funds, with interest rates as high as 20% per month, and deposits reached over 3 trillion at the highest. Currently, due to the fact that the market is constantly and unceasingly plagued by hidden worries, compared to the interest rates set by the Central Bank, there is a vast disparity, resulting in a sharp decline in deposits, from an amount of over 3 trillion to just over 100 billion, including the funds of provincial and municipal banks. It is now learned that the Central Bank has decided to temporarily suspend these deposits, and will resume them when the situation permits in the future.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Import and Export Trade Continued to Decline in June</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 4th] According to official statistics compiled by the Department of Imports and Exports, Hong Kong's import and export trade continued to decline generally in June, although trade with the United Kingdom and Japan continued to rise.</p>
<p>Total imports in April were HK$188 million, decreasing to HK$176 million in May, and further decreasing to HK$173 million in June. Total exports in April were HK$138 million, decreasing to HK$133 million in May, and further decreasing to HK$106 million in June.</p>
<p>Total imports for the first half of 1948 were HK$980 million, and total exports were HK$690 million. Total imports for the first half of 1947 were HK$659 million, and total exports were HK$559 million. Imports from China continued to decline slowly, while exports were able to maintain equilibrium. Imports from China for the first half of 1948 were HK$177 million, which is a decrease compared to the HK$191 million in the first half of 1947 and the HK$184 million in the second half of the year. Exports to China for the first half of 1948 were HK$109 million, compared to HK$156 million in the first half of 1947, and had decreased to HK$108 million in the second half of the year.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Certificates Rise in Market Price</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign exchange certificates has suddenly tended to rise in recent days, rising sharply to 5.6 million yuan yesterday. Adding the Central Bank's posted price, it is now close to the black market price. This move is of great benefit to export trade. According to yesterday's market price, export prices can now be considered worthwhile. Although exports have gradually increased in recent days, the peak export season is approaching, and the future of export trade is quite promising.</p>
<h3>Market Sentiment Discouraged, Sales Quiet - Rice Prices Trend Weak - White Superior Rice Already Fell Below 40 Million</h3>
<p>The rice market is trending lower. The price of tin is falling, and market sentiment is discouraged. Opening prices continued the weak trend of the previous day's close, and immediately became unsustainable and declined. Rice shops are seeing quiet sales, with little appetite for purchases and discouraged buying sentiment. White superior rice has already fallen below 40 million, with both the North and South markets at 39.5 million yuan. Ordinary paddy rice was less available, opening at 42 million. Special superior rice retreated to 43.5 million, both falling by 1.5 to 2.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. New superior rice also fell by 2 million. Unpolished indica rice had the slowest sales, falling by 3 million. Yesterday, total arrivals in the North and South markets were 5,811 shih.</p>
<p>Flour is in persistent decline, with prices falling further downstream. The report on the rice market further disheartened sentiment, and with sluggish actual sales and many small sellers dumping their stocks, prices fell again. Old-brand car flour closed at 13.25 million, falling the most by 450,000, military vessel flour fell by 200,000, closing at 12.5 million, with little trading and only slight fluctuations. Bran continued to be reduced by 200,000 to 300,000. Wheat fell by 1 million, opening at 16.5 million.</p>
<p>Coarse grains are in a wretched state. Sales are sluggish, buying sentiment is discouraged, and soybean customers are not buying, falling another 1.5 million. Zha soybeans closed at 17.5 million. Broad bean trading was very sparse, and the market fell slightly by 500,000. Corn and naked barley each fell by 2 million. Green beans finally fell by 2 million. Sesame sales were also sluggish, falling by 2 million. Raw peanuts did not open due to low prices.</p>
<p>The petroleum market continued downstream. Oil factories are opening one after another. After the market opened, the trend was particularly stable. Soybean oil was opened by various factories, with the price at 82 million, falling 3 million. Raw oil also fell by 3 million. A bucket of raw oil traded at 107 million. Raw vegetable oil fell more, falling by 5 to 6 million. Soybean cake actual sales are not picking up, falling sharply by 600,000 to 700,000.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Strengthens, Cloth Withers</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market rebounded yesterday due to excessive declines in recent days, and there was no shortage of demand. Market sentiment also turned positive. Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was sold at the opening in the morning as cloth market prices were weaker, with asking prices continuing to be 60 to 70 million lower. Subsequently, with easy credit conditions, local and northern buyers took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, and as there were many buyers in the market, the market trend slowly rose. The current asking price has gradually increased to 2 billion, an improvement of 80 million from the previous day. The futures price was 2.04 billion, an increase of 70 million. The market for 40 and 32 count yarns was also initially weak and then strong. Other counts of fine yarns improved by an average of 30 to 40 million to 70 to 80 million compared to the previous day, but only 48 pieces were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was sluggish due to obstacles in actual sales, with few customers active and large dealers generally taking a wait-and-see approach. Local dyeing factories and retail shops had not yet opened their appetite, and the market was still dominated by small sellers. Those who had tight finances were unable to bear the burden of high interest and were selling off their stocks, and the market trend gradually weakened.</p>
<p>Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell another 700,000 at the opening. Trading was still sparse after the opening, and the market continued to decline by 1 million, falling to a low of 52 million. Subsequently, with fellow traders making small covering purchases, the price rose to 53.5 million at the close, falling another 200,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>It was heard that the price had rebounded to 55.5 million due to news of easing credit conditions and frequent interest-rate-buying. Sellers asked for 600,000, but trading volume was small due to heavy rain. The prices of other cloths also declined by 500,000 to 1.2 million due to slow sales. Total trading volume for the day was 2,220 bolts.</p>

<h3>The Most Tense Program of the World Games: Basketball Game, Changes in the Situation; Belgium Defeats Chile; Analysis of the Situation of Each Team in the Second Group</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Belgium, which was frustrated in the first group of the basketball game, recently overwhelmed Chile, which was hailed as the favorite to win the championship, with an amazing performance of 38 to 36. This has caused a major change in the situation of the second group. The emergence of the top two names still depends on the two major battles between China and the Philippines this morning and Chile and Korea tonight.</p>
<p>If China can defeat the Philippines, then the remaining battle against Iraq will definitely be under control, and it can dominate the second group with a great record of four wins and one loss. If it is unfortunately defeated, then the remaining glimmer of hope will depend on whether Belgium can show another miracle and defeat the Philippines, or whether Chile will repeat the same mistake and be defeated by Korea. (If the Philippines loses to Belgium and Chile loses to Korea, then in the second group, except for Iraq, which has been defeated in every battle, the other five teams will have three wins and two losses, earning eight points. The ranking must be resolved by the scoring average method.)</p>
<p>In the second hypothesis, if the Philippines wins both the match against China and the match against Belgium, and Chile loses to Korea, then the Philippines will be in first place, and the second place will be determined by the scoring average method of China, Chile, and Korea.</p>
<p>The scoring average method is a fair calculation method that takes into account the scores and losses of each team. It multiplies the sum of a team's scores by one hundred and then divides it by the sum of the losses to find the percentage of the scoring average. The larger the percentage, the more net points the team has. According to the current situation, Chile has the most points (348) and the fewest losses (124), occupying an absolute advantage. Therefore, if our country cannot defeat the Philippines, then the hope of entering the finals is very slim. The current situation of each team before the Sino-Philippine battle in the second group, the past records, and the total scores and losses are listed below:</p>
<p>Situation of Each Team's Wins and Losses</p>
<p>Team Name Games Won Lost Points Opponents Not Played</p>
<p>Chile 4 3 1 7 Korea</p>
<p>Korea 4 2 2 6 Chile</p>
<p>Belgium 4 2 2 6 Philippines</p>

<p>Philippines 3 2 1 5 China, Belgium</p>
<p>Iraq 4 0 4 4 China</p>

<p>Belgium: Iraq 91:20</p>

<p>Philippines 176 131</p>
<p>China 124 126</p>

Due to rising prices, the anticipated high fees have caused anxiety among parents about how to raise the funds. Education Bureau Director Li Ximou stated yesterday: The fee standards for various primary and secondary schools have not yet been determined. If any school sets high fees without the Education Bureau's approval, it will be reported to the mayor for disciplinary action. The Education Bureau's position is to consider both the students' studies and the school's maintenance. Therefore, schools with excellent facilities and good management may be considered for a moderate fee increase, provided it does not hinder students' studies. Director Li believes that half of the parents in this city can afford their children's tuition fees for the next semester, while the other half can apply for free treatment from the schools. Although the free quota for each private school is set at 20%, the Education Bureau may subsidize the expenses if the quota is exceeded. The Education Bureau is also in the process of raising scholarships for needy students to help those who cannot afford to attend school. As for the children of civil servants, unless their original agency already provides educational subsidies or runs a children's school, their parents can send a letter to the Education Bureau to apply for free treatment. In addition, strict measures will be taken against the few private schools in this city that charge miscellaneous fees exceeding tuition fees.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to Jiang Jizhou, chairman of the Principals' Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city, the association will convene a general meeting around the 20th of this month to seriously discuss the tuition standards for the next semester. This standard must take into account the burden on students' parents, improve teachers' salaries, and maintain the school's survival.</p>

<h3>The Gospel of Cancer</h3>
<p>— Such is</p>
<p>I once had a friend who suddenly felt some pain in his throat when swallowing food. At first, he naturally thought it was just ordinary tonsillitis and didn't pay much attention. Later, the pain became extremely severe. He was originally a mathematics teacher, but at that time, he couldn't even teach anymore because it hurt to speak. Everyone urged him to go to the hospital for an examination. The doctor took an X-ray and simultaneously announced his death sentence!</p>
<p>The doctor said, "This is cancer, growing on the thyroid gland."</p>
<p>After that day, my friend quietly returned to his hometown. He was originally a natural scientist and understood that cancer is even more terrifying than lung disease. We wrote letters to inquire about him, but he never replied.</p>
<p>Two or three months later, we received his obituary.</p>
<p>However, scientists are silently working hard. There is already a glimmer of hope for conquering this terrible cancer.</p>
<p>In July 1946, a 73-year-old patient walked into the Memorial Hospital, a specialized cancer research and treatment center in New York. His name was Henry Hall. He was originally a reporter covering international news, had also written books and lectured, but at that time, he had cancer on his thyroid gland, and the cancer had spread to his buttocks. His right leg had become paralyzed. The day he sought treatment, he accidentally fell and dislocated his leg bone. The situation was quite serious, and the chance of recovery was extremely slim.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hall is still alive today, with a rosy complexion and vibrant spirit. On the surface, he doesn't look like a sick person. Moreover, his right leg has gradually gained strength and can barely support him.</p>
<p>However, doctors solemnly stated that his cancer has not been cured, but the development of the cancer has been stopped.</p>
<p>Hall is an "experimental patient." He volunteered to provide the hospital with experiments for various new therapies. The doctor told him that radioactive substances might help his condition, but the doctor didn't know much about it and asked if he was willing to try it. He readily agreed.</p>
<p>The thyroid gland has a strong ability to absorb iodine, but in 85% of cases, cancerous thyroid glands often stop absorbing iodine. Hall was one of the lucky few whose cancerous thyroid gland still wanted to "eat" iodine. The thyroid gland is very "stupid" and cannot distinguish whether the iodine it absorbs is radioactive. This radioactive iodine is not to be trifled with. As soon as it touches the thyroid gland, it destroys it indiscriminately, regardless of whether it has cancer or not. Fortunately, the thyroid gland is originally a useless thing in the human body; it wouldn't work if it were the liver or kidneys.</p>
<p>The first time Hall drank the solution containing radioactive iodine was on Saturday, September 14, 1946. He called it "Hiroshima Cocktail," which looked exactly like a glass of ordinary water.</p>
<p>From then on, Hall had to have blood tests, urine tests, lung tests, and heart tests every day—a total of about thirty tests. Saturday passed, and Sunday passed. He didn't feel anything unusual.</p>
<p>However, on Monday evening, his throat suddenly became swollen and felt painful when swallowing. On Tuesday, his head and neck were in severe pain, he could only eat liquids, and he had difficulty breathing all night. However, 48 hours later, the swelling in his throat had subsided, and the pain in his head and neck had stopped.</p>
<p>According to measurements, Hall's head and neck absorbed 35% of the first "cocktail." After continuous use, his thyroid gland was completely destroyed, and the tumor in his kidney began to absorb a large amount. However, the liver and kidneys can also absorb a little iodine normally, so they may be adversely affected—but this bad reaction has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>Hall himself is also very interested in this treatment and gladly said that he has been reborn. He has now begun to take large amounts of radioactive iodine. Compared to the rabbits and sheep that have been tested with atomic bombs on Bikini Atoll, his radioactivity has surpassed them.</p>
<h3>Taboo</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>A name is just a symbol for easy identification. Therefore, even if someone is called "A Cat," it is impossible to prohibit others from calling "A Cat." This principle is very clear. However, in the past, our country not only required "respectful avoidance" of the so-called imperial name, but also the names of empresses, princes, princesses, etc., were all subject to "respectful avoidance." As a result, a perfectly good name that people were used to had to be replaced with another name. This was truly tyrannical beyond reason. Moreover, some names were changed and are still used today. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Fuyang straw paper, everyone knows it. Fuyang was originally named Fuchun, but because Empress Zheng of Liang Jianwendi's name was "A Chun," "Yang" was used to replace "Chun." The pheasant was originally called pheasant, but because Emperor Gaozu of Han's Empress Lu's name was "pheasant," the Book of Fengshan in the Records of the Grand Historian said "wild chicken sings at night." At that time, the Analects of Confucius was fortunately not in the category of searching for lost books, otherwise, wouldn't the "female pheasant on the mountain beam" recorded in the Xiangdang chapter also have to be changed to "female wild chicken on the mountain beam"? The number twenty is now called "nian." Twenty is a commonly used number name, why was it changed to "nian"? Because the daughter of the Lord of Wu's name was "Er Shi" (Twenty). The chamber pot was originally called Huzi (tiger cub), but because Emperor Taizu of Tang's name was "Hu" (tiger), he had to change Huzi to "Mazi," and then it was changed to chamber pot in the Song Dynasty, which is even more ridiculous. Also, when we common people made a request to the government office, if we got the words "provisionally approved" in the comment, we would be very happy, because this "provisionally" can "provisionally" go down. On the other hand, if we get "the request is not approved" or "it is difficult to approve," there is no one who is not greatly disappointed or wants to take another route. But this "zhun" should be "zhun" (準). Water is level, so it should be from the water side, and the Book of Ping Zhun in the Records of the Grand Historian can prove it. Now the word is changed to "zhun" (准), and one point is written less on the side to distinguish it from the word "Huai" (淮). This began in the Southern Qi Dynasty, because Emperor Shun of Song's name was "Zhun," so all the histories are written as "zhun," and now it is customary to use it without knowing its mistake.</p>
<p>In traditional taboos, there is also the so-called avoidance of "suspicious names," that is, words with similar sounds must also be avoided, so even the ancients must change their surnames! For example, Emperor Xuan of Han's name was Xun (詢), and Xun (荀) and Xun (詢) have similar sounds, so Xun Qing of the Warring States period had to be forcibly changed to the surname "Sun" (孫). Emperor Ming of Han's name was Zhuang (莊), so Zhuangzi had to be changed to the surname "Yan" (嚴), so Lao Zhuang became "Lao Yan," which is really nonsense. Guangwu's old friend Yan Ziling was also originally surnamed "Zhuang" (莊). My original surname was Shen (沈), but during the Five Dynasties, there was a separatist king in Fujian named Wang Shenzhi (審知). "Shen" (審) and "Shen" (沈) have similar sounds, so the water side of Shen was removed, and it became a "You" (尢) character without a dot, and it was used as a surname, until now.</p>
<p>There are also scholar-officials who avoid their own family names. For example, Sima Qian's father's name was Tan (談). During the reign of Emperor Wen, there was a eunuch named Zhao Tan (趙談). The honest historian Sima Qian changed Zhao Tan's name to "Tong" (同) without changing his air, see Records of the Grand Historian. There are countless examples of this kind.</p>
<h3>Remembering He Huohua</h3>
<p>— Da Zhuan</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw a report in this newspaper: "Another brave general has been added to our country's World Games team on the 29th. He Huohua has arrived in London from his hometown of Rotterdam to participate in individual and team cycling competitions." I am overjoyed. Readers, perhaps you are not very familiar with Mr. He, so I will briefly describe him.</p>
<p>Mr. He is currently about 33 years old, originally from Guangdong. His Western name is Hoeard Wing. He has lived in Rotterdam, Netherlands for generations, so Rotterdam can be regarded as his second hometown. He runs a business in the city and is a well-known figure among the local overseas Chinese. He has loved sports since childhood, especially cycling, and has a deep passion for it. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, he had already won the championship in local cycling competitions and later won the Dutch National Cycling Championship.</p>
<p>Before the 11th World Games were held in Berlin, Germany in 1936, the Dutch National Cycling Association was willing to train Mr. He and invite him to represent their country at the World Games. However, Mr. He, based on his patriotic enthusiasm, was unwilling to make a wedding dress for others, so he had already repeatedly expressed his sincerity to the Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands, asking Ambassador Jin Wensi to send a letter to China in August 1935 to discuss the matter. Later, with the approval of our country's government, he was allowed to be designated as the representative for the World Games cycling championship, agreeing to go directly to Berlin to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 6 of the same year at 6:00 PM, Mr. He participated in the preliminary round of the 1,000-meter sprint race in the identity of his motherland. Overseas Chinese are certainly very happy to be able to serve their motherland. Unfortunately, in the fifth week of the race, he encountered the previous World Games cycling champion, and Mr. He was eliminated by a difference of only one centimeter. But he is strong and technically proficient, and he has made the greatest effort in this competition.</p>
<p>When World War II broke out, the Netherlands was the first to bear the brunt and was of course greatly devastated by the Nazis. After surviving the catastrophe, Mr. He actually arrived in the British capital again as a Chinese athlete. Looking west with his head held high, cheers erupted. Men from all countries are rushing to compete and are unwilling to give way. I wish Mr. He will be more vigorous than in the past, show his skills and win glory for the country!</p>
<h3>Two Chapters of Repeated Drinking</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Wine is like a soft, charming person, easiest to get close to,</p>
<p>Most confusing when lukewarm, pleasantly appropriate to the mouth,</p>
<p>Relying on it as life, accumulating for a long time without noticing,</p>
<p>Joy and anger lose their true nature, the great mistake becomes overturned,</p>
<p>Sudden damage to essence and energy, unpredictable disease;</p>
<p>Doctors warn with one voice, and fear arises!</p>
<p>Why reborn soul, lighting a lamp to steal a drink again?</p>
<p>Sweet fragrance flows through the limbs, even more appropriate than before.</p>
<p>Alas, distancing oneself from petty people, maggots attached to bones are difficult to scrape off,</p>
<p>If I had ten days, wine would also be a palace beauty,</p>
<p>Graceful boneless flower, how many feet left in the setting sun!</p>
<p>Fierce, the red of the chaste woman, the seductive rouge,</p>
<p>Why transform into a deity, always fearing the collapse of heaven and earth,</p>
<p>Drinking alone stroking the lamp waves, cherishing the past in thought!</p>
<p>Pure sweetness suddenly becomes sweet, jealous crows are originally good advisors,</p>
<p>Horse feet hanging a long bottle, shadows monitoring in and out,</p>
<p>In the past, brilliant and wise posture, desolate for whom is it reduced?</p>
<p>Holding hands looking at Penglai, the seawater is clear and verifiable,</p>
<p>Night cool, the moon is lonely and bright, turning to hurt the temporary merits.</p>
<p>Wandering and indulging again, the soul lingering in the poplar flower shop,</p>
<p>Comet hanging over Venus, a wave of the heart is afraid,</p>
<p>Don't sing the song of the great wind, looking in the mirror with a sigh of sorrow!</p>
<h3>The Price of Honesty</h3>
<p>— Jin Fan</p>
<p>A lady forgot her purse in a taxi. Just as she was about to rush to get it, the driver was already chasing after her to return it. The lady was very grateful and wanted to thank him, but the driver firmly refused the reward.</p>
<p>"However, I want to ask a very rude question," the driver said, "How much money was there in your purse in total?"</p>
<p>The lady told him. He then took out a notebook from his bag, and the notebook already had a long list of numbers. He also wrote down the number that the lady told him. Then he slowly said, "I want to calculate how many copper coins it costs to be an honest person."</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Mice Spying on the Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>Cantonese are the number one when it comes to eating lavishly, so when comparing the prices of banquets in various places, no one can surpass Cantonese cuisine. Even the solemn Beijing-Chao style is behind it.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I saw the menu of the Manchu Han Imperial Feast made by "Fangshan" in Peiping (written on red silk, and many booksellers in Liulichang mounted it for sale as page leaves). At that time, it was known as the most aristocratic diet. Its special products, such as Buddha's Hand Swallow Dish, Clear Stewed Fish Lips, Braised Shark Fin with Osmanthus, etc., are now sold separately in Chunming Pavilion and other places, and each dish still costs tens of millions of gold. The entire feast has 83 dishes (including fruit porridge and snacks, etc.), which is still magnificent. However, if compared with the contemporary Grand Han Imperial Feast of the Moshan Pavilion in Guangzhou, it is very shabby. The Moshan Pavilion's menu combines snacks, vegetables, and fruits, but there are only more than 50 dishes, and at that time, it required 400 yuan. The "Fangshan" feast price did not exceed 100 yuan, so judging from the high and low prices to compare the degree of luxury, the Beijing-Chao faction is not an enemy of the Cantonese faction. The Moshan Pavilion's menu lists the names of clear stewed bear paws, braised white heron silk, braised golden coin leopard, etc., which is also more magnificent than what Fangshan has reached. This is the different type of selection of materials, which is not enough to prove that it is inferior.</p>
<p>Today, the most aristocratic diet to be verified in Peiping is not Fengzeyuan, nor Chunmingguan, nor the so-called "Park Board of Directors," but it still belongs to the private kitchen of the Cantonese, such as the Tan family cuisine and Guan family cuisine, which are popular at the time, all of which are in the style of Moshan Pavilion.</p>
<p>In the 16th year of the Republic of China, when the National Government first moved to Nanjing, Tan Zuan used a Cantonese cuisine of 120 yuan a table to go to Niushoushan to sacrifice to Qing Daoren, and invited friends to eat the leftovers together. At that time, he was very surprised by his extravagance, and the newspaper also sent a special telegram for it. I don't know that Moshan Pavilion already had a special supply of 400 yuan a table.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang and Fei Mu Cooperate; The Sorrows of Parting on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Not long ago, Mr. Feng Zikai and I visited Dr. Mei Lanfang. That day, Mr. Feng tried his best to persuade Dr. Mei to shoot a color movie. Now this matter has been realized, and it officially started shooting on the evening of July 29. This not only satisfies Mr. Feng's hopes, but also what people who care about Ling Wang (Mei Lanfang) are looking forward to.</p>
<p>On the evening of May 28, the first test shoot was made, shooting a scene of Bawang Bie Ji (Farewell My Concubine) dancing with a sword. On the evening of June 21, a scene of Jing Meng (Startled Dream) from The Sorrows of Parting was shot again. The two experiments have added a lot of experience. When screening the test shots, everyone thought they were satisfactory. Not only was the recording clear, but the light and colors were no less beautiful than imported movies. That is the achievement of Mr. Yan Heming's years of hard work.</p>
<p>Regarding the script, it was decided after Dr. Mei personally discussed it with Mr. Fei Mu several times, because The Sorrows of Parting depicts the sorrow of national subjugation. The story is tortuous and moving, and it is a well-known Mei opera masterpiece on the stage. Now it will be adapted by Mr. Fei and directed by himself.</p>
<p>This movie uses new techniques while retaining the essence of the old play. It is not just moving the opera on the stage to the silver screen. It combines the strengths of movies and old plays. It can be called a new creation.</p>
<p>Now the official shooting has started—rehearsals have already been done many times at Mei's residence. The important scene of Chai Fang Quan Tao (Persuading to Flee in the Woodshed) was successfully completed on the first night. In this scene, there are Liu Shui Ban, Yao Ban, and very important dialogues. The mood is very tense. The picture is rich in pattern beauty. The woodshed is piled with messy firewood, and a pair of candlesticks are lit in front of the window, and the moon is outside the window. The candlesticks were blown out, leaving the embers of the unextinguished smoke, which set off the moonlight, symbolizing the fate of Han Yuniang (the main character in the play). Several shots from different distances and angles were quickly taken under the guidance of Mr. Fei. Although the weather was hot, everyone did not feel tired, and everyone was happily working. Especially me, I feel very excited. In this opportunity, I can follow Ling Wang and Mr. Fei Mu, whom I have always admired, as well as my husband Wang Shaoqing, to work together. This is really something I am proud of. [Editor's note: The author of this article, Mr. Ni Qiuping, is Dr. Mei's Erhu player.]</p>
<p>After finishing the work, in the breeze, a group of people took a car and returned to Mei's residence in the morning light. Everyone took a temporary rest in laughter, and only then did they feel tired.</p>
