<p>〔本報蚌埠十八日電〕蚌宿戰塲之國軍，於戰事吿一段落之際，暫取守勢，淮北方面，由李兵團控制曹老集，五河，懷遠三大據點以內地區，淮河以南，劉汝明兵團負責淮南路之防務，另有兩個或三個以上的軍，確保津浦南段。惟根據記者於今晚向各方面接見所得，顯示軍事當局在過去二十四小時以內，對當面戰局有新的決定，此一決定之指標，將一以策應南下之杜聿明所部，一以追擊殘匪，完成蚌宿會戰之最後勝利。今晚據此間剿總發言人章毓金（聯合社稱章已離蚌當不確）稱：「黃兵團向匪猛攻，至今午，將匪縱深封鎖陣地完全粉碎，匪紛紛北竄，刻除以黃兵團繼續北追外，我原有向西北攻擊之李延年兵團，已調整部署，改變攻擊方向，卽可向北推進，與黃杜兩部協力夾擊永城附近之匪·」另一高級將領則向記者表示：「國軍正</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十八日電〕劉峙今日仍坐鎭蚌埠，此間人心巳定，南遷者已不如前兩日之多。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠十八日電〕據有資格之軍方人士透露，關於黃維將軍之動向，刻尙係一秘密，據一般推測，黃氏可能於該部突圍時，率領一部輕裝部隊，向某一方向行動。又，今日此間街頭已有黃兵團所張貼之收容散失官兵之通吿。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十八日電〕據悉：蚌埠以北之國軍，十八日已撤退至淮河南北兩岸之堡壘防綫上。李延年兵團十七日晚與黃維兵團之一部份會師後，滿載國國增援部隊，南下之列軍則擠滿難民，局已決定轉守淮河兩岸。津浦綫北上之火車上，滿載國軍增援部隊，南下之列車則擠滿難民，蚌埠城中已有若干恐慌，一般認為共軍卽將進攻此城。一部份未突圍之黃維兵團已向西進攻。</p>
<p>杜韋明指揮下之李彌。邱淸泉及孫元良三個兵團，仍固守徐州至永城間陣地。據杜將軍以無綫電吿劉峙總司令稱：祗要接濟不斷，該三兵團能一直守下去。外傳劉時將軍已在南京三十五哩西北之滁縣成立其總部，蓋蚌埠南四十哩之明光附近己發現大批共軍，故蚌埠之撤退，除駐軍外，實屬必要。</p>
<p>〔中央社蚌埠十八日電〕軍息：（一）南進兵團昨在劉樓附近擊潰匪第三縱隊，獲致重大戰果後，旋又克復孫莊等村鎭七處，今晨戰事更向有利方向進展中。（二）向北進剿之國軍，十七日在陳家集·王小圩（包家集北）·高家店（何集北）之綫，又擊潰匪軍一部，計斃傷匪九百餘人，殘匪正越澮河向北逃竄。〔又電〕軍息：我黃維兵團之第十八師長尹俊將軍，於十七日率所部官兵，已在何集·包家集之綫完成有力部署，該綫陣容在胡璉將軍督飭下，士氣極為振奮，現正與李延年兵團部署協同對匪進剿計劃。</p>

<p>〔本報江都十八日電〕蘇北國軍為控制沿江據點，防匪渡江，十七日起由宜陵磚橋（西距揚州十八公里）向南主動出擊，當日收復匪軍老巢曹王市，並乘勝追擊殘匪，已於今日正式進駐大橋，距江口僅五公里。</p>
<p>〔本報江都十八日電〕沿揚天長公路西進國軍，於進駐大儀集後，現向大儀週邊地區繼續掃蕩殘匪，另息：天長縣府已於十七日撤離縣城。</p>
<h3 id="c3">平津外圍無大戰鬥　古城日間沉寂晚有緊密槍砲聲傳來　津週邊亦僅有零星接觸 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平十八日下午六時四十分電〕平郊戰事今日較為平寂，由晨至下午三時，市內不聞砲聲，三時後，西北郊砲聲頻傳。據今午消息，平市四郊廿華里無戰鬥，西郊殘共已退至藍靛廠。八寳山地區西南郊匪軍集結於大小于村北郊，匪退至靑河附近。南苑方面情勢亦趨穩定，一度激戰之西郊農林試騐塲，萬壽寺·八里莊等處據點均已在國軍控制下，豐臺情勢穩定。今晨自平至豐台公路鐵路均暢通，戰車來往巡迴，平東郊國軍收復八里橋後，通縣外圍有前哨接觸。石景山在國軍固守中，門頭溝亦無變化，南口方面曾有戰鬥，但軍方尙未證實有收復南口消息。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日下午八時半電〕平市今晚七時五十分復聞緊密槍砲聲自西南方傳來，迄發電時尙未獲悉戰况。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日下午九時半電〕豐台附近匪今晚七時半，向東北移動，與國軍正激戰于運花池（廣安門外西南郊），一時槍砲聲劃破黃昏寂靜。據軍方息：匪仍係小股竄擾，以攻代守，因匪似已將主力轉移于塘沽方面，平外圍匪兵力薄弱尙談不到攻城。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕軍方認為十六日夜至十七日下午廿四小時內，平西及西南西北郊區普遍激戰，可謂主力接觸，犯西郊林匪付出極大代價。剿總今發佈：平郊國軍聯合兵團對試探竄擾平外圍之匪，連日堅强反擊，予匪重創，十七日國軍砲步空密切配合，竟日四出攻擊，在平西萬壽寺東西地區擊敗林匪五縱隊三個師，僅五塔寺西北一帶地匪遺屍八百餘具，平東通縣與馬駒橋間東北地區，擊潰林匪入縱隊，三間房附近匪遺屍五百餘，南苑機塲殲滅匪軍一個半營，於國軍勝利聲中，戰事趨沉寂。昨夜今日匪未敢出動，情况無變化，今午後空軍在平郊區轟炸匪砲兵陣地及股匪，戰果良好。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕此間晚報載稱：傳林彪匪一部已進入寳坻，有繼續南竄模樣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十八日電〕北平城內仍在作戰爭準備，天安門外已架砲，兒童醫院屋頂亦安置機關槍。警備司令部佈吿：任何變亂，均能制止，人民應各鎭靜安居，並勸建築避彈所，以防共軍砲轟·各公署·學校·工廠及其他機關，均應組織巡邏隊，以防宵小破壞。官吏未經准許，擅自離平者將受軍法審判。人民亦須獲得許可，方能離城。傅作義曾吿誡守城軍隊，謂兵力已集中北平，將予共軍以致命打擊，勝利可操左券。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十八日電〕華北剿總今發表：北塘戰事十七日夜沉寂，十七日午匪一股由北塘車站附近向北塘鎭東南端竄犯北塘鎭，國軍當對匪展開激烈戰鬥，至午後四時，斃傷匪五百餘人，戰鬥入夜沉寂。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十八日電〕津週邊情况益緊，陸續發現匪情，攻防戰序幕演進中。</p>
<p>〔本報天津十八日電〕津十八日晨二時許聞隆隆砲聲，至五時許歇止。據警備部發表：大畢莊（津東北約二十華里）東北孫莊子，歡坪兩地，發現匪二三千人，附砲兩門，番號不明，經國軍砲擊後潰退。另匪一部，由赤碱灘（津東北約四十里）南竄貫兒莊，國軍正監視中·塘沽東北之北塘，盤據有匪林彪部廿六師兩團，津北武淸盤據有匪三團，津南唐官屯，朝宗橋平靜，靜海東煤廠之匪，國軍曾予剿擊，匪向東北竄退，該地區匪騎兵二連，曾與國軍接觸，俘匪七名，步槍七校。匪津南大隊十六晚曾向東大寨（小站地區）竄擾，已被擊退</p>

<h3 id="c18">星期論壇　中國生產教育之路 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 張文昌</p>
<p>中國傳統式的敎育，士大夫階級的色彩太濃了，還是數千年來的『勞心者治人，勞力者治於人』的觀念；『四體不勸，五榖不分』的有閑分子和特權分子的文雅敎育與升學準備。現在社會變了，政治要求民主化，經濟要求生產化，社會要求大衆化；但敎育仍是不變，一切設施，依舊是不民主的。祇知消費而不事生產，英雄主義與領袖崇拜。所以我們應提倡生產敎育，鼓勵勞動，倡導職業。</p>
<p>但是生產敎育自民國四五年以來，公私上下提倡總算盡力了：組織全國性的職業敎育社，成立中學二部制，成立職業學校；民國十一年時頭佈新學制，中學裏有職業選科；國民政府成立以後，中學裏的手工科改為勞作科，且視為主要科之一；政府提倡减少普通中學，加多職業學校，同一地方中學公立太多者改為職業學校；私立中學，普通科限制立案，職業學校容易立案；抗戰時更有所謂各省中學區之設立，一中學區內務必使中學，師範與職業三種學校平均設立。關於經費分配方面；有中學百分之四十，師範百分之二十五，職業百分之三十五之規定。規定小學畢業生升學分配為普通中學十五分之八，師範十五分之四，職業十五分之三。</p>
<p>最近情形，以校數言，普通中學為百分之七十二强，而職業學校祗占百分之十三弱；從學生數量言，普通中學占百分之七十九强，而職業學校祇占百分之六賜；從經費言，普通中學約占百分之七十，而職業學校祇占百分之十四，以上距離敎育部對經費分配之標準與學生升學分配標準，相差皆遠。且據從、事職業敎育興實際辦理職業學校的人看來，都很悲觀。從學生言，招生難，出路更不易。從經費言，財政拮据，師資與設備皆欠充實。從敎師言，請敎員困難，職業界中人都不願敎書，願敎書的人未必能勝任職業敎育。從課程言，科目與鐘點太多，且多空洞理論，少實際價値，對於實習塲所，與材料皆成問題。總之，職敎敎育，困難重重，前途殊不光明，這是我們當前的苦悶。</p>
<p>生產敎育在中國不發達，其癥結究在那裏？據作者觀察有下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）心理的原因：這還是封建思想在那裏作祟。「萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高」，這個典型的讀書人，就是升官發財型的士大夫。他們是勞心的治人階級，是高出於老百姓的。以前是八股與科舉，現在是洋八股與洋科舉，總而言之，是不屑談生產，因為生產是農，工，商的事，尤其是農工的事，士為四民之首，以生產為恥的，種田的弄泥巴多可恥，做工的脫下長袍做手工多下流，所以學的是文雅敎育，卽使洋八股裏也有生產之術的大學裏的工科，農科等，將來也是做的是農官，工官，或敎農書，工書，這種心理一日不去除，中國是無法發展生產事業，也更無法提倡生產敎育。</p>
<p>（二）物質的原因：中國產業落後，生產不發達，老是停留在手工業時代，生產不能利用機械奴隸，因此民生愈凋敝，物資愈缺少，農村愈見崩潰，生產愈見萎縮，職業機關停頓或關閉，根本用不到職業敎育機關培植出來的人才。畢業生出路旣少，投考的學生必不多，這是互為因果的。</p>
<p>（三）政治的原因；中國何以這樣產業落後呢？　治不上軌道，生產事業備受權殘，治安·交通·原料供給·工具購置，在在發生困難，尤其是國家經過八年長期的抗戰又加上三年來戡辭的戰事，怎樣可使生產發達呢？</p>
<p>至於生產敎育的出路何在？我們認為封建思想將再站不住跟，已被時代所揚棄。現在是民主的時代，提倡大衆化與勞動生產的敎育方合於時代的要求。新中國在創造中，凡不能配合這個要求的一切，將被摧毀與淘汰，敎育自亦不能例外。所以今後的國民敎育與中等敎育應特重此點：「三分普通，七分生產」，應為今後一切基本敎育的基本方針。學校塲地必有生產之設備，學校跺程應有應用之技藝，一切普通學校內皆有手腦並甩，學用相通的課程與活動，以能解決日常生活需要為着手點。以能勞動為榮，以能生產為榮，仿效蘇聯把十年基本敎育改為統一勞動或多藝性的學校，並不是嚴格的職業性，而是能升學又能就業的準備性。如此觀念一改，學風不變，生產敎育的根本困難卽解決了一環。</p>
<p>其次，過去生產敎育的辦法是孤立式的做法，職業學校歸職業學校的一套，生產機關又是生產機關的辦法，其結果，職業學校是理論多於實際，實騐不够重視，師資設備不够標準，學生絕少出路。職業機關難找理想人才，自辦藝徒訓練或招收練習生，又缺少敎育意味與敎育人才。這種孤立辦法是要不得的；我們提倡生產敎育與生產機關合一，卽生產與敎育結婚。</p>
<p>要之，職業學校必須興生產機關打成一片。每一職業學校中之一科必須至少與一生產機關合作，甚至把這職業學校搬到生產機關附近或簡直設在生產機關內，由其代辦，而由原設立者，（不論私立或公立）補助一部分經費與人材。其課程與設施亦須全般改組，一切以適合生產機關之需要為原則，好像醫學院與醫院；護士學校與醫院的關係一樣。</p>
<p>學生的選擇以其智能為標準，用新式能向測騐與職業指導量表為依據，在小學畢業前或初中畢業前嚴密謹愼地舉行，然後送入職校；如年齡太幼，或家長及本人尙未作最後決定者仍可升學，在升學期間選習試探性的職業準備科目，以為進一步之向導。</p>
<p>職業學校的學雄膳宿等費，應改至極少，使其在學時期，以其工作所入，作為一部份之自助自給，其餘由家長負担；或其家長能力不及者由公家或私人法團，或該生產機關，提出一部分經費作為助學金。得助學金補助之學生，除實習外，另須工作若千時，以表示自食其力而無依賴惡習，一方面半工半讀，（在學時間稍延長些，因學科時數相當减少）可加增其對職業的經驗。（寄自國立師範學院）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市各界慰勞剿匪將士代表團徐蚌勞軍歸來，昨日中午假新生活俱樂部招待新聞界，由團長方治報告此行經過及前綫觀感。慰勞團一行係於六日自滬乘火車至京，八日搭津浦路專軍至蚌埠，九日上午向劉總司令致敬，赴劉汝明兵團司令部慰勞，下午分組至駐城各單位慰勞。次日配合全國性之慰勞第一團及地方性之慰勞第三團，赴前綫慰勞李兵團及其所轄軍各師單位。十一日方團長隨劉總司令搭專機飛黃維兵團及杜聿明副總司令駐在地上空，與杜黃二將軍通話，對十二兵團空投慰勞品，專機飛越匪區時，並投下傳單「紙彈」。其餘團員分兩組赴臨淮關門台子等處慰勞傷兵。十二日全體乘津浦路車離蚌返京，因路軌被破壞，中途原車折返。十三日路軌修復後，繼續前進，並在嘉山附近由團負凑集金圓券五萬元，慰勞擊潰破壞路軌匪部之國軍，當晚返抵首都。綜計此行發放慰勞品銀幣五十萬元，毛巾一萬八千打，手套一萬八千零二十打，襪十一萬八千打，香烟八十大箱，糖菓一百七十八大包。慰勞團在前綫目擊士氣旺盛，民心安定，相信國軍有必勝把握。方氏綜合此行觀感稱：（一）前綫士氣旺盛，惟軍民軍政配合尙未盡善，前方民衆出力出錢，負祖極重。（二）民衆武力亟須發動加强，以抵禦匪之竄擾。（三）前綫士兵精神物質均極缺乏，對於乾糧鹹菜香烟連環圖畫報紙畫報小說等允為需要。（四）傷兵救護必須改善，前綫非但病車少，且紗布便紙棉被等均極缺乏，希望各界另組傷兵服務慰勞團，以除傷兵之痛苦。最後方氏並轉達總統向本市各界致謝之意，及囑勉繼續努力，不斷慰勞、以求不斷的勝利。</p>

<p>工商部某負責人談稱：該部為充裕合國各紗廠明年原棉來源起見，巳擬訂緊急辦法，通令實施。</p>
<p>（一）督促國營民營各紗廠，以產量20％輸出，換國外棉一六〇萬市担。（二）美援全郁棉花三九九，〇六五包，交換紗布百分之五十。外銷部份，速令外銷，可換廿萬包，計八十萬市担。（三）擬建議當局於金圓兌存外匯及全部美棉交換紗布百分之五十，內銷資金酌　四，〇〇〇美元，交國行購進外棉二〇萬包，計八〇萬市担，以上三項，可得棉花三二〇萬担。（按本年全國實際開工紗錠為三六〇萬錠，每月需原棉七十萬四千市担，則每年須原棉八四四萬八千市担。）</p>
<p>〔又訊〕國棉收購工作，兩月以來，因各機關苦於頭寸不足，以致收購工作至為困難。迄目前為止，各方購者僅十餘萬担。以此收購連度，則明年各紗廠所需原料，勢必感覺困難。且每年收購最旺期僅為三月，自九月至十一月，現中央銀行中紡公司為加强收購計，特各撥出二億元，與前所撥者共為六億元，督促各處趕速辦理，至本月底，希望收足五十萬担。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕紡建公司，華中區收購棉花，漢口委託鄂省棉花產銷合作社。截至十五日，漢口·沙市·漢川·新堤共收棉花四九，六一一担。至收購款項，則由紡建公司漢口辦事處撥付。湖南省收購情形，因棉花質雜幷摻水多，僅收棉二，〇〇〇市担，棉織品原料　蔴三，〇〇〇市担。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation in Bengbu and Suzhou Awaits Development: National Army Has Made New Decisions, Liu Zhi Sits Firmly in Bengbu, Calming People's Hearts <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 18th] The National Army at the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield has temporarily adopted a defensive posture as the war comes to a temporary halt. In the Huaibei area, the Li Corps controls the areas within the three major strongholds of Cao Lao Ji, Wuhe, and Huaiyuan. South of the Huai River, the Liu Ruming Corps is responsible for the defense of the Huainan Railway. There are also two or three more corps ensuring the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. However, according to what this reporter learned from various meetings tonight, the military authorities have made new decisions regarding the current war situation within the past 24 hours. The goal of this decision is to support Du Yuming's forces heading south and to pursue the remaining bandits to achieve the final victory of the Bengbu-Suzhou campaign. Tonight, the spokesperson of the local Suppression Headquarters, Zhang Yujin (United Press claims that Zhang has left Bengbu, which is inaccurate), stated: "The Huang Corps launched a fierce attack on the bandits, and by noon today, they had completely crushed the bandits' deep defensive positions. The bandits are fleeing north in droves. In addition to the Huang Corps continuing to pursue north, our original Li Yannian Corps, which was attacking northwest, has adjusted its deployment and changed its direction of attack, and will soon advance north to cooperate with the Huang and Du Corps to encircle and annihilate the bandits near Yongcheng." Another senior general told the reporter: "The National Army is</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 18th] Liu Zhi is still sitting firmly in Bengbu today, and the people's hearts here have settled down. The number of people moving south is not as many as in the previous two days.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 18th] According to qualified military sources, the whereabouts of General Huang Wei are still a secret. According to general speculation, Huang may have led a lightly armed unit in a certain direction when his troops broke through. Also, today there are notices posted on the streets here by the Huang Corps, calling for the regrouping of scattered soldiers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] It is reported that the National Army north of Bengbu has retreated to the fortified lines on both sides of the Huai River on the 18th. After the Li Yannian Corps met with part of the Huang Wei Corps on the evening of the 17th, trains filled with National Army reinforcements heading north and trains packed with refugees heading south. A decision has been made to switch to defending both sides of the Huai River. Trains heading north on the Jinpu Line are filled with National Army reinforcements, while trains heading south are packed with refugees. There is some panic in Bengbu, and it is generally believed that the Communists will soon attack the city. Part of the Huang Wei Corps that has not broken through is attacking westward.</p>
<p>The three corps of Li Mi, Qiu Qingquan, and Sun Yuanliang under the command of Du Yuming are still firmly defending the positions between Xuzhou and Yongcheng. General Du telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, stating: "As long as supplies continue, the three corps can continue to hold out." It is rumored that General Liu Shi has established his headquarters in Chuxian, 35 miles northwest of Nanjing. As large numbers of Communists have been discovered near Mingguang, 40 miles south of Bengbu, a retreat from Bengbu is necessary except for the garrison.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 18th] Military News: (1) The southward advancing corps defeated the bandit's Third Column near Liulou yesterday, achieving a major victory, and then recovered seven villages and towns including Sun Zhuang. The battle is progressing in a more favorable direction this morning. (2) The National Army advancing north to suppress the bandits defeated part of the bandit army on the line of Chenjiaji, Wang Xiaowei (north of Baojiaji), and Gaojiadian (north of Heji) on the 17th, killing and wounding more than 900 bandits. The remaining bandits are fleeing north across the Hui River. [Another Dispatch] Military News: General Yin Jun, commander of the 18th Division of our Huang Wei Corps, led his troops and officers on the 17th to complete a strong deployment on the line of Heji and Baojiaji. Under the supervision of General Hu Lian, the morale of the troops on this line is very high. They are currently coordinating with the Li Yannian Corps to plan a joint operation to suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 18th] To control the strongholds along the Yangtze River and prevent bandits from crossing the river, the National Army in northern Jiangsu actively attacked south from Yiling Zhuanqiao (18 kilometers west of Yangzhou) starting on the 17th. On the same day, they recovered the bandit army's lair, Caowangshi, and pursued the fleeing bandits in victory, officially entering Daqiao today, only 5 kilometers from the river mouth.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 18th] The National Army advancing westward along the Yangtianchang Highway continues to sweep up the remaining bandits in the areas surrounding Dayi after entering Dayi. Another report states that the Tianchang County government has withdrawn from the county seat on the 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e3">No Major Battles on the Periphery of Beiping and Tianjin; The Ancient City is Silent During the Day and Tight Gunfire Heard at Night; Only Sporadic Contact Around Tianjin <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6:40 PM, 18th] The fighting in the suburbs of Beiping was relatively quiet today. From morning to 3 PM, no artillery fire was heard in the city. After 3 PM, artillery fire was frequently heard in the northwest suburbs. According to news this afternoon, there was no fighting within 20 li of the four suburbs of Beiping. The remaining Communists in the western suburbs have retreated to Landianchang. In the southwest suburbs of the Babaoshan area, bandit troops are gathering in the villages north of Dayu and Xiaoyu. In the northern suburbs, the bandits have retreated to the vicinity of Qinghe. The situation in Nanyuan has also stabilized. The strongholds in the western suburbs of the Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Field, Wanshou Temple, and Balizhuang, where fierce fighting once took place, are all under the control of the National Army. The situation in Fengtai is stable. This morning, the highway and railway from Beiping to Fengtai were open and tanks were patrolling. After the National Army in the eastern suburbs of Beiping recovered Balibqiao, there was forward哨 contact with the outskirts of Tongxian. Shijingshan is being firmly defended by the National Army, and there is no change in Mentougou.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9:30 PM, 18th] Bandits near Fengtai moved northeast at 7:30 PM tonight and are engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in Yunhuachi (southwest suburb outside Guang'anmen). The sound of gunfire broke the twilight silence for a time. According to military news: the bandits are still small groups harassing as they retreat, attacking as a defensive measure, because the bandits seem to have transferred their main force to the Tanggu area. The bandit forces on the periphery of Beiping are weak and cannot be described as attacking the city.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The military believes that the widespread fierce fighting in the western, southwestern, and northwestern suburbs of Beiping within 24 hours from the night of the 16th to the afternoon of the 17th can be described as a major engagement. The bandit forces attacking the western suburbs suffered a great price. The Suppression Headquarters announced today that the joint corps of the National Army in the suburbs of Beiping has launched strong counterattacks against the bandits probing and harassing the periphery of Beiping for several days, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits. On the 17th, the National Army's artillery, infantry, and air force closely coordinated and launched attacks in all directions throughout the day, defeating three divisions of Lin Biao's Fifth Column in the area east and west of Wanshou Temple in western Beiping. In the area northwest of Wutasi alone, more than 800 bandit corpses were left behind. In the northeastern area between Tongxian and Majuqiao in eastern Beiping, the bandit forces of Lin Biao's Eighth Column were defeated, with more than 500 bandit corpses left behind near Sanjianfang. The Nanyuan Airport annihilated a battalion and a half of the bandit army. Amid the sounds of victory of the National Army, the war has become quiet. The bandits did not dare to move last night and today, and the situation has not changed. This afternoon, the air force bombed bandit artillery positions and bandit gangs in the suburbs of Beiping, with good results.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] Local evening newspapers reported that a part of Lin Biao's bandit troops has entered Baodi and seems to be continuing to flee south.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 18th] Beiping City is still making war preparations. Artillery has been set up outside Tiananmen, and machine guns have also been installed on the roof of the Children's Hospital. The Garrison Headquarters announced that any disturbances can be stopped, and the people should remain calm and live in peace. It also advised the construction of air-raid shelters to prevent Communist artillery bombardment. All government offices, schools, factories, and other institutions should organize patrols to prevent sabotage by criminals. Officials who leave Beiping without permission will be tried by military law. People must also obtain permission to leave the city. Fu Zuoyi warned the troops defending the city, saying that forces have been concentrated in Beiping and will give the Communist army a fatal blow, and victory is assured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced today that the fighting in Beitang was quiet on the night of the 17th. At noon on the 17th, a group of bandits from the vicinity of the Beitang Railway Station attacked Beitang Town from the southeast end of Beitang Town. The National Army launched a fierce battle against the bandits. By 4 PM, more than 500 bandits had been killed or wounded, and the fighting subsided at night.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 18th] The situation around Tianjin is becoming increasingly tense. Bandit activity is being discovered one after another, and the prelude to the defense and counterattack has begun.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 18th] Loud artillery fire was heard in Tianjin from around 2 AM to 5 AM this morning. According to the Garrison Headquarters, 2,000 to 3,000 bandits with two artillery pieces of unknown number were discovered in Sunzhuangzi and Huanping, northeast of Dabizhuang (about 20 li northeast of Tianjin). They retreated after being shelled by the National Army. Another part of the bandits fled south from Chijiantan (about 40 li northeast of Tianjin) to Guan'erzhuang, and the National Army is monitoring them. Two regiments of Lin Biao's 26th Division of the bandit army are entrenched in Beitang, northeast of Tanggu. Three regiments of the bandit army are entrenched in Wuqing, north of Tianjin. Tangguantun and Chaozongqiao in the south of Tianjin are quiet. The National Army has launched a suppression operation against the bandits in the Dongmei Factory in Jinghai, and the bandits have fled northeast. Two companies of bandit cavalry in the area have made contact with the National Army, capturing seven bandits and seven rifles.

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] The Hong Kong telegram of the American Christian Science Monitor described Li Jishen as an old warlord prepared by Moscow to be the future puppet prime minister of China. It also said that Li has denied being a Communist, but his recent speeches have all been actively pro-Communist. Li is surrounded by Communists. Whenever he meets with reporters, he must be accompanied by an interpreter who is full of Communist terms. It is still questionable where Li Jishen's activity expenses come from. As for the Communist Party's use of Li, the reason for needing a puppet prime minister and a government with a democratic appearance to fully implement communism in China is to use Li to entice talented people and intellectuals, because the Communist Party still lacks such governing personnel.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Weekly Forum: The Road to Production Education in China <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenchang</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese education has too much of the color of the scholar-official class. It is still the concept that has existed for thousands of years: "Those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others"; the elegant education and college preparatory studies of the leisurely and privileged classes who "do not move their limbs and cannot distinguish the five grains". Now society has changed. Politics demands democratization, the economy demands production, and society demands popularization. But education remains unchanged, and all facilities are still undemocratic. People only know how to consume and do not engage in production, and they worship heroism and leaders. Therefore, we should promote production education, encourage labor, and advocate for vocations.</p>
<p>However, since the fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China, public and private efforts to promote production education can be considered exhaustive. National vocational education societies were organized, a two-part secondary school system was established, and vocational schools were established. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, a new education system was announced, and vocational electives were offered in secondary schools. After the establishment of the National Government, the handicraft courses in secondary schools were changed to labor courses and regarded as one of the main subjects. The government advocated reducing ordinary secondary schools and increasing vocational schools. In the same area, if there were too many public secondary schools, they were changed to vocational schools. The establishment of private secondary schools with ordinary courses was restricted, while the establishment of vocational schools was easier. During the War of Resistance, so-called provincial secondary school districts were established, requiring that secondary, normal, and vocational schools be established equally within each secondary school district. Regarding the allocation of funds, it was stipulated that 40% should go to secondary schools, 25% to normal schools, and 35% to vocational schools. It was also stipulated that the allocation of elementary school graduates to higher education should be 8/15 to ordinary secondary schools, 4/15 to normal schools, and 3/15 to vocational schools.</p>
<p>The current situation, in terms of the number of schools, shows that ordinary secondary schools account for over 72%, while vocational schools account for less than 13%. In terms of the number of students, ordinary secondary schools account for over 79%, while vocational schools account for only about 6%. In terms of funding, ordinary secondary schools account for about 70%, while vocational schools account for only 14%. The above figures are far from the Ministry of Education's standards for funding allocation and student admission allocation. Moreover, those engaged in vocational education and those who actually run vocational schools are very pessimistic. From the students' point of view, enrollment is difficult, and finding a job is even more difficult. From the perspective of funding, finances are tight, and teachers and equipment are insufficient. From the teachers' perspective, it is difficult to hire teachers. People in the industry are unwilling to teach, and those who are willing to teach may not be competent in vocational education. From the perspective of curriculum, there are too many subjects and class hours, and there is too much empty theory and too little practical value. Practical training venues and materials are also a problem. In short, vocational education faces many difficulties, and the future is not bright. This is our current distress.</p>
<p>Why is production education underdeveloped in China? According to the author's observation, there are three reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Psychological reasons: The feudal ideology is still at work. "All occupations are inferior, only studying is superior," and the typical scholar is the kind of scholar-official who seeks to be promoted and get rich. They are the ruling class who labor with their minds, and they are superior to the common people. In the past, it was the eight-legged essay and the imperial examination, and now it is the Western-style eight-legged essay and the Western-style imperial examination. In short, they disdain to talk about production, because production is the business of farmers, workers, and merchants, especially farmers and workers. Scholars are the first among the four classes of people, and they are ashamed of production. How shameful it is for farmers to work in the mud, and how degrading it is for workers to take off their robes and do manual labor. Therefore, they learn elegant education. Even in the Western-style eight-legged essay, there are engineering and agricultural sciences in universities that teach the art of production, but in the future, they will also become agricultural officials, industrial officials, or teachers of agricultural books and industrial books. If this mentality is not removed, China will not be able to develop its production industry, and it will be even more impossible to promote production education.</p>
<p>(2) Material reasons: China's industry is backward, and production is underdeveloped. It is always stuck in the handicraft era, and production cannot utilize mechanical slaves. As a result, people's livelihoods are increasingly impoverished, resources are increasingly scarce, the countryside is increasingly collapsing, and production is increasingly shrinking. Vocational institutions are suspended or closed, and there is simply no need for the talents cultivated by vocational education institutions. With fewer job opportunities for graduates, there will inevitably be fewer students applying for admission. This is a mutually causal relationship.</p>
<p>(3) Political reasons: Why is China's industry so backward? Governance is not on the right track, and production enterprises are subject to abuse of power. Difficulties arise in security, transportation, raw material supply, and equipment procurement. Especially after the country has gone through eight years of long-term war of resistance and three years of civil war, how can production be developed?</p>
<p>As for the way out for production education, we believe that feudal ideas will no longer be able to stand their ground and have been abandoned by the times. Now is the age of democracy, and promoting education that emphasizes popularization and labor production is in line with the demands of the times. A new China is being created, and everything that cannot meet this requirement will be destroyed and eliminated, and education is no exception. Therefore, future national education and secondary education should pay special attention to this point: "Three parts ordinary, seven parts production" should be the basic policy for all future basic education. School grounds must have production facilities, and school courses should have applied skills. All ordinary schools should have courses and activities that combine manual and mental work and integrate learning and application, starting with the ability to solve daily life needs. Take pride in being able to labor and take pride in being able to produce. Imitate the Soviet Union by changing the ten-year basic education to a unified labor or multi-skilled school, which is not strictly vocational but preparatory for both further education and employment. If this concept is changed, and the atmosphere of learning does not change, the fundamental difficulty of production education will be solved in one aspect.</p>
<p>Secondly, the past method of production education was an isolated approach. Vocational schools had their own set of methods, and production organizations had their own set of methods. As a result, vocational schools were more theoretical than practical, experimentation was not valued enough, teachers and equipment were not up to standard, and students had few opportunities. Production organizations had difficulty finding ideal talents and had to run their own apprenticeship training or recruit trainees, but they lacked educational meaning and educational talent. This isolated approach is unacceptable. We advocate the integration of production education and production organizations, that is, the marriage of production and education.</p>
<p>In short, vocational schools must be integrated with production organizations. One department in each vocational school must cooperate with at least one production organization, or even move the vocational school near the production organization or simply set it up within the production organization and have it run by the organization, while the original founder (whether private or public) subsidizes a portion of the funding and personnel. Its curriculum and facilities must also be completely reorganized, with everything based on meeting the needs of the production organization, just like the relationship between medical schools and hospitals, and nursing schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>The selection of students should be based on their intelligence, using new-style aptitude tests and career guidance scales, conducted carefully before elementary school graduation or junior high school graduation, and then sent to vocational schools. If the age is too young, or the parents and the students themselves have not made a final decision, they can still go to general education, and select exploratory vocational preparation subjects during the general education period as further guidance.</p>
<p>The school fees and boarding fees for vocational schools should be reduced to a minimum so that during their studies, their income from their work can be used as part of their self-sufficiency, with the rest borne by their parents; or if their parents are unable to do so, a portion of the funding can be provided by public or private legal entities or the production organization as scholarships. Students who receive scholarship subsidies, in addition to internships, must also work for a certain number of hours to show that they are self-reliant and free from the bad habit of dependency. On the one hand, they work part-time and study part-time (the study time is slightly longer because the number of class hours is considerably reduced), which can increase their experience in the profession.

The judgment states: "Wang Yintai colluded with an enemy country, plotted to resist his own country, and is sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for life, and confiscation of property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family." Wang was originally sentenced to death in the first instance. This reduced sentence was because the puppet organization in North China was formed in 1937, and Wang joined in May 1938, so he was not considered to be a co-conspirator, and therefore his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th dispatch] A major robbery occurred on the No. 11 night express train from Beijing to Shanghai when it arrived in this city this morning. Wang Shigen, an apprentice from the Beijing Dachang Rubber Factory, was carrying 180,000 gold yuan in a leather suitcase, intending to deliver it to the Dachunghua Rubber Factory in Shanghai. Unfortunately, he was coveted by five men in American military uniforms when he boarded the train. At 5:11 a.m. this morning, when the train arrived at Xiyangqi in this city, one of them cut the electric wire in the car, and another jumped out first, while the others carried out the robbery, throwing the suitcase out of the window. The apprentice also tried to follow and jump out, but he was dragged back by an accomplice at the door. When the train arrived at Suzhou Station, the three men also escaped without a trace. The apprentice then burst into tears and intended to commit suicide. The railway police chief learned of the situation and immediately gathered police officers to apprehend the suspects. As a result, they arrested a soldier at Qianwanli Bridge who was about to flee with the stolen goods.

<h3 id="e37">U.S. Government Orders MacArthur to Immediately Implement Plan to Stabilize Japanese Economy; Aims to Accelerate Recovery and Establish a Single Exchange Rate Early; Yoshida Expresses Satisfaction with New U.S. Directive <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The State Department and the War Department jointly announced today that the United States has ordered MacArthur to implement a nine-point economic stabilization plan in Japan to prevent inflation and increase production and exports. The United States took unilateral action on December 10 to issue the directive to MacArthur. Only after implementing the plan will the Far Eastern Commission be notified. In their joint statement, the State Department and the War Department pointed out that economic stabilization is essential to restore the Japanese economy and ensure the effective use of U.S. funding. The United States will pay attention to the Japanese attitude toward implementing the plan while considering future requests for funding to Japan. Officials explained that plans will be developed to help establish a single exchange rate as soon as possible. However, the officials did not specify when the exchange rate would be established or its nature. It is said that this plan will be strictly enforced and may not be welcomed by the Japanese initially, but it will benefit them economically in the long run. The nine-point plan aims to: (1) Strictly reduce expenditures and increase government tax revenues to achieve a balanced budget as soon as possible; (2) Accelerate and strengthen the tax collection plan; (3) Only provide loans for projects that contribute to economic recovery; (4) Establish effective wage stabilization measures; (5) Strengthen and, if necessary, expand price controls; (6) Improve foreign trade control measures and tighten current foreign exchange controls to the point where these measures can be executed by Japanese institutions; (7) Improve the current distribution and rationing system to maximize exports; (8) Increase the production of all major Japanese raw materials and manufactured goods; (9) Improve the effectiveness of the food collection methods.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 18th] Prime Minister Yoshida, in an exclusive interview with Agence France-Presse reporters today, stated that he was very satisfied with the new U.S. directive to stabilize the Japanese economy. He agreed that Japan should stabilize prices and wages, prevent inflation, collect taxes, and properly allocate raw materials before increasing Japanese production for export. However, he pointed out that the main problem is how to achieve these desired goals. He declined to comment on the methods his government would use to achieve these goals, especially since his government is still a minority party on the eve of the Japanese general election.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Well-informed sources confirmed on the 18th that the United States is building Japan into a fortress of the anti-communist defense line in the Pacific. They said that this policy was chosen by diplomatic and military leaders because it is considered the best option at a time when the Communist Party is rampant in China. In coordination with the new policy of supporting Japan, the War Department and the State Department jointly announced a plan to stabilize the Japanese economy on the 17th.</p>
<p>The official announcement from the government suggests that if Japan fails to reform, the United States will cut aid to Japan. Officials said that this plan focuses on economic recovery and aims to force Japan to implement the plan for the strategic interests of both Japan and the United States. It is pointed out that if China turns red, Japan will be the outpost on the anti-communist defense line stretching from the Soviet-occupied Kuril Islands in the north, through North and South Korea and Okinawa, to the Philippines in the south. The authorities emphasized that the United States will not rebuild Japan economically or militarily as a springboard for U.S. aggression in the Far East. They explained in detail that the current strategy is entirely based on the anti-communist plan and has no other intentions.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 18th Broadcast, The Hague: According to the official gazette, the Dutch government has decided to establish a provisional federal government in Indonesia and will not recognize the Republic of Indonesia. Observers believe that the establishment of the provisional government will shatter the last hope of reaching an agreement with the Republic of Indonesia. It is reported that the Dutch Lower House convened a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the Indonesian issue.</p>
<p>Dutch sources observed that when the Dutch government refused to continue negotiations with the Republic, it declared, "The Netherlands clearly bears all responsibility." Therefore, even if the UN Mediation Committee is still working in Indonesia, the Dutch still have the possibility of launching an attack regardless of everything. Radio Jogjakarta, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, broadcast that an unidentified aircraft flew over Jogjakarta, believed to be a Dutch reconnaissance plane. The Antara News Agency of Indonesia stated that the Dutch document to Indonesia has the nature of an ultimatum. The document requires Indonesia to withdraw all troops that have entered the Dutch-occupied areas in the past few weeks and insists that the status of the Republic of Indonesia in the transitional government must be equal to the status of other small Dutch states in Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 18th Broadcast, The Hague: A spokesman for the Dutch Overseas Colonies Ministry expressed skepticism about the report from Batavia that U.S. representative Cochran had flown back from Jogjakarta with a final appeal from the Republican government.

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 18th] South Korean Foreign Minister Chang Taek-sang declared today that Communist-controlled North Korea should be regarded as lost territory and will be recovered by force if necessary. However, no action is planned until the UN delegation comes again to find a way to unify North and South Korea. Representatives from North Korea are welcome to offer unification suggestions as representatives of political parties and social organizations, not as representatives of the communist government. We recognize the Soviet occupation forces in North Korea, but as soon as the Soviet forces withdraw, we will not recognize the existence of any government. We intend to expand our political power to the lost territory peacefully. We do not want to fight our own people, but if the North Korean people defy the authority of the legitimate government, then we must conquer them. It is reported that the Soviet Union has announced that all stationed troops can be withdrawn by the end of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the Jiangya steamer disaster, the District Prosecutor's Office specially appointed two prosecutors, Cao Hong and Yu Bingquan, to investigate the issue of responsibility. The prosecutors went to the site of the sinking of the Jiangya steamer outside the Wusongkou on the previous day for an on-site inspection and retrieved two pieces of iron plate from the explosion. The prosecutors are currently studying which part of the ship the iron plate belongs to. On the 21st of this month, the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications will send experts to inspect the iron plate and summon the surviving captain and chief mate of the ship for questioning to clarify the truth. According to the person in charge of the District Prosecutor's Office: It can be asserted that this iron plate did not come from the boiler, but probably belongs to the cargo hold. The bottom of the ship is smooth and complete, proving that it did not encounter a mine. However, it is too early to determine who is responsible at this time and must wait for expert judgment before a decision can be made. In addition, the families of the victims of the Jiangya steamer jointly submitted a complaint to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, accusing Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Xu Xueyu, General Manager, and Shen Dacai, the captain, of negligent homicide and requesting the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate and prosecute them from a humanitarian standpoint to comfort the thousands of wronged souls who died.

Yesterday noon, the delegation hosted the news media at the New Life Club, where delegation leader Fang Zhi reported on the trip and impressions from the front lines. The delegation traveled by train from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 6th and took a special Jinpu Railway train to Bengbu on the 8th. On the morning of the 9th, they paid respects to Commander-in-Chief Liu and went to the headquarters of Liu Ruming's Corps to offer comfort. In the afternoon, they split into groups to visit and comfort units stationed in the city. The next day, in coordination with the First National Comfort Mission and the Third Local Comfort Mission, they went to the front lines to comfort Li's Corps and its subordinate military units. On the 11th, delegation leader Fang Zhi accompanied Commander-in-Chief Liu on a special plane to the airspace above Huang Wei's Corps and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming's base, spoke with Generals Du and Huang, and airdropped comfort supplies to the 12th Corps. When the special plane flew over the bandit area, leaflets and "paper bullets" were dropped.

Fang Zhi summarized his impressions of the trip as follows: (1) The morale of the front lines is high, but the cooperation between the military and civilians and between the military and the government is not yet perfect, and the people at the front are contributing a great deal of effort and money. (2) It is necessary to mobilize and strengthen the people's armed forces to resist the bandits' intrusions. (3) The frontline soldiers are extremely short of both spiritual and material supplies, and they particularly need dry food, pickles, cigarettes, comic books, newspapers, magazines, and novels. (4) The care for wounded soldiers must be improved. Not only are there few ambulances at the front, but also gauze, toilet paper, and cotton quilts are extremely scarce. It is hoped that various circles will form another wounded soldier service and comfort mission to alleviate the suffering of wounded soldiers. Finally, Fang Zhi also conveyed the President's thanks to all sectors of the city and urged them to continue their efforts and continue to comfort in order to achieve continuous victories.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhao Heming and Yang Haoran, who recently impersonated the Chief of the Audit Section and auditors of the Finance Bureau, arbitrarily extorted money from merchants under the pretext of auditing, victimizing more than ten households. On the 16th, Zhao Heming was arrested by the Songshan Police Bureau, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Yang was also arrested by the branch police while dancing at the Dadong Dance Hall at approximately 7:30 PM last night and will be prosecuted.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Recently, the Municipal Finance Bureau has uncovered many cases of unscrupulous individuals impersonating auditors and other officials of the bureau to extort money from merchants. For this reason, the bureau issued a statement yesterday stating that the bureau does not have a "Audit Section" or "Auditors," and when dispatching personnel for auditing, they must wear badges and have duty orders with the private seal of the bureau director and the bureau seal. There are three types of duty orders: special, A, and B. Special orders can replace the mayor's orders, A orders can only be used for auditing and cannot be used for transferring accounts, and B orders can only be used for duty work when investigating bills. If merchants find anyone without the above documents, they are impersonating. It is hoped that merchants will report to the Finance Bureau by telephone at any time, and the bureau will immediately send personnel to investigate thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Ministry of Industry and Commerce Formulates Emergency Procurement and Storage Measures to Enrich Cotton Mills' Required Raw Cotton; Implementation Can Obtain 3.2 Million Dan of Cotton <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>A person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that the ministry has formulated emergency measures to enrich the source of raw cotton for all cotton mills in the country next year and has issued a notice for implementation.</p>
<p>(1) Urge state-owned and private cotton mills to export 20% of their production in exchange for 1.6 million dan of foreign cotton. (2) Exchange 50% of the 399,065 bales of US aid cotton for cloth. The exported portion can be exported quickly and can be exchanged for 200,000 bales, totaling 800,000 dan. (3) Propose to the authorities that 50% of the foreign exchange and all the US cotton exchanged for cloth be used for foreign exchange and the amount of domestic sales funds be adjusted to 4,000 US dollars, and hand this over to the national bank to purchase 200,000 bales of foreign cotton, totaling 800,000 dan. The above three items can obtain 3.2 million dan of cotton. (Note: The actual number of working spindles in the country this year is 3.6 million spindles, requiring 740,000 dan of raw cotton per month, so 8.448 million dan of raw cotton are required per year.)</p>
<p>[Additional News] For the past two months, the national cotton purchase has been difficult because various agencies have been suffering from insufficient funds. To date, only about 100,000 dan have been purchased by various parties. At this rate of purchase, it is inevitable that the raw materials required by various cotton mills next year will be difficult to obtain. Moreover, the peak season for annual purchases is only three months, from September to November. Now, the Central Bank and China Textile Corporation have each allocated 200 million yuan to strengthen the purchase, totaling 600 million yuan with the previous allocation, urging all places to handle it quickly, hoping to purchase 500,000 dan by the end of this month.</p>
<p>[Additional News] China Textile Corporation, Huazhong District purchased cotton, and Hankou entrusted the Hubei Provincial Cotton Production and Sales Cooperative. As of the 15th, Hankou, Shashi, Hanchuan, and Xindi had purchased a total of 49,611 dan of cotton. The purchase funds are paid by the Hankou Office of China Textile Corporation. In Hunan Province, due to the poor quality of cotton and excessive water content, only 2,000 dan of cotton and 3,000 dan of ramie for cotton textile raw materials were purchased.</p>

<p>Not long ago, a large amount of paper hoarding in this city was released, with an estimated total of over six thousand reams of paper being thrown onto the market. The price of white newsprint had fallen from a high of 300 yuan per ream to 70 yuan, and still, there were few buyers. However, it has recently risen again to 160 yuan per ream, more than doubling from before. According to industry insiders, the reasons for this are (1) the recent stabilization of the situation, with demand in the market not decreasing; (2) a consistent view of firm prices, with retail investors taking the opportunity to buy in; (3) the rising prices of outward transfer certificates recently, with the C.I.F. price reaching a cost of 220 yuan per ream, it is said.</p>

Clashes occurred at various banks. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are currently studying countermeasures, with a decision expected soon.</p>
