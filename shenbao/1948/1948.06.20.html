<h3>雷震與青年黨　協商無結束</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕張羣·吳鐵城·雷震在滬與靑年黨之洽商，昨日仍無結果。張·吳昨日未與靑年黨代表晤面，一切由雷震出面活動。雷氏於上午曾赴範園訪晤張君勸，中午應陳啟天宴，午後四時赴海格路參與靑年黨內部會商，至晚八時始吿結束。據靑年黨某常委表示：該黨中常會之決議，為希望立委名額能在二十人以上。如立委問題不獲解決，則不但不擬參加政院，即司法考試兩院亦不擬參加。又據有關人士吿記者：張羣此來，交涉對象固爲民靑兩這，但實以靑年黨爲主，因民社這不參加政院之決定已不能改變，故亦不欲相強。民社黨之立委名額，事實上已無問題，雷震希望靑年黨先派立委十人出席立院，再續商其他問題，否則局勢如再度僵化，將無人願負折衝之責。</p>
<p>據中央社息：靑年黨人士重提「決定有關國家利益之重大問題時，應由三黨事先協商」之主張。彼等之意，認爲此項原則如獲確定，實爲今後使三黨繼續合作之重大保證，故甚願三黨先就加何實行此項原則一點進行討論。雷氏除將此項意見轉吿張羣外，並定二十日晚返京　命，張氏則在滬尚有數日勾留。</p>
<p>又，民社這今日下午舉行中常會。</p>

<h3>征收臨時財產稅案　立法原則已確立　以戰前財產價值三萬元為起征點　推定三委員研擬條文</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕立法院財政及金融委會臨時財產稅及淸查豪門資本小組，十九日晨開會繼續審查劉不同所提之征收臨時財產稅案，召集委員簡貫三主席。政院財部直接稅署署長王撫洲，亦應邀列席。經熱烈討論後，決定各項原則如下：（一）征課方式兼採屬人主義及屬物主義，由人找物及由物找人之技術，視情形運用。（二）起徽點自民國廿六年財產價值三萬元起征，依物價指數昇計。（三）稅率自然人及法人均採全額累進制，唯從事生產事業之法人，則予以差別待遇，劉氏原案最高稅率百分之六十，原則上應減低。（四）征課程序先自大都市大亨着手，從速開始申報進行調查，並採檢舉提名吿密各辦法。中央由立，監，司法三院組中央督導委會，地方則由大中學校，新聞記者公會，民意機構，司法機關，組織地方督導委會。（五）外人在華財產國人在外財產，亦一律爲征課對象。至此立法原則已全部確立。最後推定簡貢三，劉不同，崔敬伯三人據此研擬條例草案之條文，提出委員會討論決定後，報吿閉會。</p>

<h3>幣制改革問題　中美正研究中　陳立夫在華府告美記者</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕陳立夫十八日在我駐美大使館招待記者稱：與美援華計劃有關之幣制改革問題現已由中美雙方政府在作非正式之研究與探討中。陳氏稱中國之經濟學者與金融家久已在從事設法改革經濟情況，且已訂定甚多改革幣制計劃。但陳氏指出不論以金本位為基礎，　　恢復使用銀幣，唯有情勢能更趨穩定時計劃方可成功。渠又稱：同時着手任何幣制改革以前，須達成某種程度之通貨穩定，但此種穩定惟有對國內之資源財產善加利用，並改進一般情況，始有達成可能。詢以經濟援華計劃同時並進之擬議中之一億二千五百萬美元軍事援華是否足　用以　平共　，陳氏答稱此數固屬不小，但仍嫌不够。</p>
<h3>監院第五次大會　通過監察法草案　即咨送立院請速完成立法程序</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕監察法草案全部已於監院十九日上午舉行之第五次會議中討論修正通過，並即決議稱：「監察法草案業經修正通過，即由院咨送立院，請其迅即完成立法程序，以便行使職權」。此一監院根本大法草案，終於初步完成。（　察法草案全文刊二版）。</p>
<p>上午之會</p>
<p>今日監院全日舉行第五次會議，上午之會於九時開始，于院長主席。開始討論經全院審查會通過之監察法草案。首由田炯錦說明審查經過後，即逐條討論，至十二時半散會時，僅通過第一章總則四條。因其中有兩　會引起熱烈辦論，一爲糾正權之是否列入於監察法內，其先爲張維翰委員之意見，認爲在憲法上，對糾正權並未作明確之規定，故不應一併列入於監察權內。有人　爲憲法上雖未明確規定，但巳能確知監察權內有糾正權，或爲憲法上之漏洞亦有此可能。表決時，仍以主張維持原案者多。其次，當討論至監委行署時，復有人提出海外設立　委行署之必要。亦經較長時閒之討論，仍按原草案通過。</p>
<p>下午之會</p>
<p>下午之會，於三時三刻繼續舉行，首由于右任主席，至五時大會休息後。于氏因事先退，是時副院長劉哲亦因事未到，當公推田炯錦主席，繼續主持會議。午後之討論，最初仍以第五條增加海外設立監委行暑為討論之中心，發言者極多，大多以情理上言，均支持於海外設行署，而在法理上則鮮有支持者。旋討論決定，乃以決議案行之，其決議文如次：「俟本案經立院完成立法程序後，關於第五條之施行，擬請政府儘先撥款派員往國外視察」。此即補充對海外設立行署之意。在第五條及其決議文通過後，進行即極順利，僅在「調查」一章內復遭遇若干修正處，討論甚久。又在討論「糾正權」一章時，原條文所列係指定調查對象爲「政院及所屬各級機關之工作及設施」，若干委員認爲對象太少，不免使在此範圍以外之機構漏於法外，當堅決主張在行政院外增加司法，考試兩院，擴大彈劾權行使之對象與範國，惟終以表決時獲票少數，未能通過。會議至七時始畢。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕記者頃以南京漢口將因美援物資運輸之便利，而開闢爲內河港口，允許美國船隻經由長江航行至該兩港口卸貨或裝貨一事，詢某外交人士，據吿：此項特許，並非所謂「開放內河航行權」。內河及沿海航行權，乃指外國船舶航行於我國內河或沿海港口間，起卸或裝載貨物之謂。倘外國船舶駛來我國，於對外國商務及航業開放之任何口岸地方或領水內，起卸一部載貨，再將餘貨運往上述之任何口岸地方及領水；或於出港時在上述之任何口岸地方及領水，同樣裝貨；就法理言之，均不能視爲「開放內河或沿海航行權」。此種情況於中美友好通商航海條約第廿四條中，記載至爲明晰，實不容任何人曲解，以損政府威信。勝利後聯總救濟物資之運輸，亦曾獲得我政府之特許，使運載救濟物資之外國船舶直接駛入沿江指定之口岸卸裝貨物。今爲美援物資運輪之便利，並爲減少轉船之昂貴之工資，及時間物資之損耗，重以特許方式為短期之措施，自　　當。在此情況下非唯京漢兩地有開港之必要，即九江亦可能爲運送美援船舶入口卸貨，及內地物產出口裝船之口岸，然渠對此項措施是否列入中美關於執行援華計劃之雙邊協定中一點，拒絕透露，唯謂不列入似較列入允爲方便。</p>

<h3>港不遵守缉私協定　我將提出要求　改變香港地位</h3>
<p>〔合眾社南京十九日電〕絕對可靠之政府人士十九日語合衆社稱：中國感覺香港並不道守中港緝私協定，故如中國資金繼續非法逃出，中國可能於短期內耍求改變香港之地位。中港數月前在南京訂立條約，由雙方合作防止走私，然中國資金不逃港，尤以上海廣東為甚，中國認此　反協定之「走私」。中國經濟有兩大絕症，一爲華北游資逃滬，英改則爲游資自滬越粵境踴入香港。中國政府以爲此縣將「枯竭中國之活血」，香港當道則未盡力合作，加以阻遇。中國政府明知如直接要求取回香港，可能早英國摔直拒絕，其後中國可能將事提交聯合國，然亦不致成功，　英國可望操縱足够票數，否決中國之要求。</p>
<p>權威人士指出：由於與論之逐漸　迫，特別是商人方面，將使中國要求在港政府中取得代表權，具有足夠　力以制止走私。「當然游資集中對香港有利，然吾人感　覺港府應在文字及精神上遵守緝私約，而在此對中國休戚有閣之事項上　吾人加緊合作」。</p>

<h3>重整道德與發揚我國文化</h3>
<p>— 樊光</p>
<p>美團布克曼博士發起　翰　聲個邵，自六月三日起在洛杉　好　　十選大會，世界各　參加者三十餘國，我國亦由立法院陳副院長代表出席·此　實可爲今日抵　狂瀾，挽回浩刧之一大轉鑽。惟　他原爲我國數千年來　牌倫理文明之結晶，自西化東　，發乃用歐變　，逐利急功；而重整道德之會　，反發　於物質文明極端發達之美國人士，彼意知所本矣，亦見其學術研究之湛深，故能溯本窮源而覓其大也。</p>
<p>我國自有文化以來，即提倡道德，學以是爲的，身以是爲修，家以之而齊，國以是爲治；數千年來，涵育滋長，普遍于全民族，而以　國萃。顧道與德爲二事：道者乃日用，　物當然之理，發之而修　有得于心則爲德。周體云：「道多才　，德能躬行。」老子云：「道生之，德畜之，是以萬物莫不尊道而貴德。」大學云：「大學之道，在明明德。「孟子云：」天下有道，小德役大德」；又云：「以德服人者，中心悅而誠服也。」諭語曰：「道之以政，齊之以刑，民免而無恥；道之以德，齊之以體，有恥且格。」此種道德實爲古今中外求治安，求和平之最高哲理。</p>
<p>自世毀道　，失　重利，遂開刧殺之機，以致兵連禍結，不可收拾。孟子曰：」上下交征利，而國危　。」今天下交征利，世界　得不危！正宜如孟子對梁惠王之言曰：「亦有仁義而已矣，何必曰利。」今如能確實重振道德，依據該會議所倡等之誠實，無私，無私，博愛四大宗旨更宏而充之，人以是爲依歸，國以是而為治，則功利　而世變有安。惟政治根於文明，今世界文明為精神物資大潮流，歐美文明專從物質方面發取；我鰓文明，在古代原從　劉物資兩方均有發　，春秋戰國之際，諸子百家並出，論　縱積，而物質發明，亦趨極盛。　　始　　一天下，欲為萬世之　，以物資文明易忘其國，乃　　抗醫，　金盟　，物資　　，由小亞細亞流人西方；於是西　遂歷世發展物質文明，至今日鼎盛，而我國歷代君主，又師始　故智，錮蔽黎民，愚弄黔首，　物質爲形下之學，且鄙之爲奇技淫巧，於是我遂僅從精神文明方面，維繫不墜。自淸末海禁大開，我感物質文明之不足應付，乃競開學堂，派遺留學，以爲吸收物質之用；而西方儒者，亦漸與我　文化接觸，其研究深者，遂恍然瞭悟於我邦精神文明之高深偉大。</p>
<p>著書立論，每常言欲求他界真正和平幸福，非求請我中國文化不可。藍西方旣以物質為主，側車功利，而其近　之言論，如物競天擇，弱肉強食等，均　　　門爭。　世界物資有限，人類之　望無窮，一有不滿，則人與人爭，　與　爭，爭之不已，人類之劫大矣。惟我幾千年來精神文化，純以造德為主，行仁履義，只求精神滿足，不岡物資。孔子曰：「朝聞道夕死可矣。」又日：「君子謀　不謀食。」顏回居陋港食瓢飲，飲水曲肱而枕之，人不堪其　，回也不改其榮。原　所居，　　　　，　樞　肘，不以為病。點　　以為相，楚聘為卿，均辭不受，殘而　不　體；楚王　金帛，其妻去之，而　之日康。　皆知信道修德，求精神之安　，鄙視物資而不以置諸　念也，故　與無爭·營趙普　半部論語之天下，實則其所見　陋，尚未聞君子之大道，夫大學之首章云：「大學之　，在明明　，在新民，在止於至　」。而其作用則為格物，致知，誠蠶，正心，修身，齊家，洽　，平天下·即此一章足以治天下而有餘。所謂修身者，即躬行道讓之　；　　治劉平天下者，即以一己之運鑲，同化于　，于天下也·</p>
<p>道攤之洽，期爲　治，亦爲易治，因道讓本爲人之所同具，在治者不過引之使　同化，則　然相　　。我國在　史上　　異　　限所侵略，然不旋踵都被我同化。自來如五胡　　，突　侵　，契丹禍晉，女真滅宋，元代入主，不久皆同化於我而自亡其種　，清人　明，　國至三百年，然今日滿族　被悶化　。　我偷理文明，感召最　，同化力極大，沾其化者，不期然而自然融化於此大洪爐陶冶之中也。現我旣需吸收物質文明，而西方羣感需要我國文化，今日二十世紀誠爲世界兩大文明已至合流之盛會，我亟宜趁此良機，迎上潮頭，宣揚我華文化於世界，使世界人人都能正心修身，都能家齊國治，將孔子所謂大同之世，即可實現；而軍同軌，書同文，行同倫天下一家，何爭之有？故世界一日接受我國文化，即一日真正和平實現。而人類得救，可享理想上生民幸福矣。</p>
<p>要而言之，道　者，修身，　家，治國，平天下而致世界大同盛洽之切基也；故處今日人慾橫流洪水滔天之亂世，重整會　實為對下　，有挽危亡　沉局之大望；惟被素習於物質文明之　手，不過偶然感觸，乘　　啟發；而指導調　，着手回春，則端　我習於此道之和　庚桑耳。故余以爲，今宜趁行　切甚，立時組續央文化院，將我國文化宣　於全世界，以為救國救民世界之　大新政；一面即適應美人之提倡，速於我國組織中國道　重整協會以相呼應，而黃利利用。更宣由我代表主張，使該會成為永久固定　　，指導道總重整之進行。此時　宣揚吾國精神文化世界千　一時之良機，萬不可交　失之。朝阿野上下，不少　　通明之士，　不河漢斯言。</p>

<h3>西德實施幣制改革　蘇聯探取反措施　下令封鎖鐵路公路交通　宣稱德分裂局面已完成</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十九日電〕德境蘇聯當局頃發表蘇軍總司令紫柯洛夫斯基署名之宣言，宣布西方盟國之單獨實施西德之幣制改革，爲究成德國之分裂。與此項宣言同時發表者　蘇聯軍政府之下令禁止自西德進入蘇聯佔領區之火車公路客運，以及步行旅客，及禁止西　新　　懈之輸入蘇聯佔領區。蘇聯軍政府釋明此項新　令並不影響　　之空中交通，而鐵路及運河之貨運雖不禁止，但將施以更嚴格之監督。西德與蘇聯佔領區間之電話及郵運，亦不受影響。但其宣言又曰，俟局勢需要時，隨時將採取其他措施。索柯洛夫斯基之宣言，除宣布東西德國之分裂已吿完成外，並日，德國境內之有兩德幣制存在，將使國內之貿易關係以及西　與蘇佔區間之貿易，實際上將等於兩國國家間之貿易。紫帥之宣言全文有云：「西國之單獨實施幣制改革，係違背德人民之意志及利益，不過係爲美英法獨佔資本家之利益而施行，單獨實施幣制改英已完成德國之分裂，顯然業已　背規定應視德國爲一個經濟單位的波茨坦決議及盟國管制德國協定。西方强國，以不可能議定整個德國的四强幣制改革爲辭，以為其單獨行動辯護，西方佔領區內美英法獨佔資本家，在　經支援法西斯主義及發動第二次世界大戰的德國大資本家的支持下，實施其分裂德國的政策，單獨的幣制改革加强此等反動派之政治與經濟地位，對於工人階級祇有損害而無裨益」。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林十九日電〕蘇聯方面業已表示不能出席將於十九日召開以老慮幣制改革之柏林四强聯合司令部（四强柏林軍政府）之特別會議，柏林區蘇軍事長官葉里薩洛夫致函召開該會之本屆聯合司令部會議主席法國迦納　將軍，對渠之未能出席該次會議，表示遣憾。</p>
<p>並曰，蘇佔領當局對於幣制改革問題之意見，固已早有聲明。另據蘇聯控制之柏林電台稱，英軍政府長官竟已斷然拒絕索柯洛夫斯基歡迎四强.同改革幣制之行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十九日電〕被目爲未來東德政府「影子內閣」之德人民大會，於十九日午刻在相林蘇聯區內召開緊急會議，柏林市議會亦定於星期一召開特別會議，談論因西德實施幣制改革而引起之局勢。蘇聯區德經委會十八日午夜應召赴索柯洛夫斯基總部開會，事後一委員聲稱，吾人將繼續努力，使東西間之貿易得以賡續，藉以保持德國統一之外貌。」另據確息，由於西德幣制改革之並不包括柏林，故在蘇聯宣布東德幣制改革之決議以前，柏林市內各區間之活動，暫時不致有限制。</p>
<h3>西德監督實施　經濟新計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社佛朗克福十八日電〕美軍政府首席財政顧問班納特談稱，討論四强共同幣制改革，目前已嫌過遲，但猶盼不久能與蘇聯區恢復貿易關係。渠料西德於實施幣制改革後，在六個月內將發生大批失業現象。德人方面之反應，乃爲雖覺幣制改革爲不愉快之舉，但亦爲必要之措施。據佛朗克福電台報吿，西德警察將監督幣制改革計劃之順利施行，商店有拒絕出售物品者，將施以干涉。杜塞爾道夫來電謂，持有舊幣者亟思脫手，不惜出三千馬克（合英金七十五鎊）之高價購咖啡一磅，英美製香烟黑市售價四十馬克，合英金一鎊。</p>
<h3>薪水階級無影響　暴發戶打擊最重</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕英經濟臘問韋　今夜向德人民發表演說稱，「貨懈改革法曾經審愼考慮，務求負担公平。新法保護平民，對於戰時暴發戶，則絕不容情。」西德幣制改革初步現象，爲一般薪水階級平日少有積蓄，損失不多。中產階級存款損失重大，依賴儲蓄或利息爲生者，或須找尋工作。豪富階級，易於破產，尤以戰時利潤爲然。黑市商人今後走頭無路，若不焚毀其紙幣，惟有設法向當局　明　收入之來源。</p>
<p>〔路透社佛朗克福十九日電〕英財政專家聲稱，西德幣制改革之良好結果，有賴於馬歇爾援助案下物資之足量供給，及改革後的新稅制法之宣布。新稅制將使德國之較貧苦階級獲得實惠，苟無此兩因素，則此次西德之幣制改革，將爲戰後歐洲最使人民感覺痛苦的幣制改革。</p>

<p>〔聯合社雅典十九日電〕希臘政府軍昨對游擊厭　動最大攻勢，在飛機大砲掩護下，已在北中部葛拉莫斯山麓獲得新陣地，該處爲游擊隊總司令部所在地。</p>
<h3>美蘇佔領區邊境　局勢一度嚴重　英裝甲車出動</h3>
<p>〔聯合社赫爾姆斯特十九日電〕英軍今日出動裝甲車十輛開抵此間，同時蘇軍當局則將企岡進入柏林之旅客數百人逐回。英方此舉係因謠傳蘇軍已派坦克車至美佔區邊境所致。</p>
<h3>波蘭照會美政府　抗議西德協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕波關昨日照會美國，對於西方各國決定設立西德政府一節提出抗議，認爲倫敦六國協定違反雅爾達與波茨坦協定。該項照會係由波大使維尼克維茲遞交美國務部次長亞摩爾。維氏事後並向記者宣稱，六國協定給予德國較其蒙受兵燹各鄰邦優先復興之權利，且漠視波蘭對於德國問題之觀點，波蘭礙難承認。</p>
<h3>多瑙河會議</h3>

<p>〔路透社貝魯特十八日電〕黎巴嫰總理索爾今日自開羅返抵此間後談稱，阿拉伯聯盟政委會業已一致議決對巴勒斯坦問題之態度，決不變更，對於分治或建立猶太國之計劃仍予堅決拒絕。阿盟政委會並決定不與猶方代表舉行圓桌會議，僅同意派遣專家若千前往　德島。阿盟政委會並決定反對巴勒斯坦休戰期之延長，公允解決辦法之談判如不幸而破裂，則阿拉伯將恢復作戰。又據羅德島來電稱，貝那多特今日自台拉維夫抵該島後，表示不政有圓桌會議在該島舉行，繼其抵該島之猶阿人員僅爲專家，並無成立決議之權。貝氏並率直承認目前盼望有和平象徵，尙嫌過早。　〔合衆社台拉維夫十八日電〕以色列國今日正式通知貝那多特稱，該國準備於下週派　代表赴羅特島以討論解決巴勒斯坦問題之永久辦法。法議會兩派起衝突</p>

<h3>西部旅行告一段落　杜魯門總統返白宮　此行對其政治資本顯已增高</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕杜魯門華今返抵府，其和平十字軍旅行至是吿一段落。杜氏此行遠至西海岸，往返九千英里，歷時十五日，發表非正式談話六十次，對共和黨控制下之國會大肆攻擊。杜魯門於兩黨舉行全國代表大會前之旅行，無疑使其獲得若千友人，其政治資本亦似增高。</p>
<h3>美援外案陷僵局　兩院昨晚再開會　滿意解決猶有最後希望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十九日廣播：華盛頓訊：本日美參院開會十八小時，討論國會閉會前各項重要未了事務，情緒之緊張，爲參院史上除辯論美國參加國聯問題一次外所未有。當參院開會時，參院主席范登堡與衆院議長馬丁曾舉行秘密會議，以謀就對外援助基金數額問題獲致妥協，結果決定今夜再度召開聯席會議一次，至於結果如何，至甚重視。苟在國會閉會時而猶無解決辦法，勢將使馬歇爾計劃陷於僵持狀態。或則參院讓步，最後接受衆院之削减辦法，如此則亦足以影響馬歇爾計劃之成效，猶如馬卿所指出者。惟聯席會議旣再召開，則及時獲得滿意之解決辦法，猶有希望。</p>

<h3>陳立夫氏名著　生之原理　英譯本將在美出版　龐德敎授備致推崇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕立法院副院長陳立夫氏，對於哲學有湛深之研究，其所著「生之原理」一書，出版於卅三年八月，問世以來，已行銷廿五萬册，哲學界耆宿態十力柳翼謀等對是書均有甚高之評價。此書現已由哈佛大學博士貴州大學敎務長曾以漢書英譯獲法蘭西學院獎金之任泰民英譯爲Philosyhy　of　Life，由紐約哲學圖書社（PhilosoplicalLibrary）印行，日內即將問世。預卜此書在美出版。對於東西民族相互間之了解，以及文化之交流，必將有甚大而有益之影響。</p>

<h3>世運發揮威力　仁餘遭逢慘敗　七十比卅四形勢一面倒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕世運籃球隊昨夕一反第一織之萎賺不振，發揮無上威力，以鉅大之比數，痛　　鳳仁餘嚴，結果七十比三十四，上半時廿七比十四分。各將演出，登峰造極，聯絡亦臻化境，而李世僑之　傳托射，得心應手，矯若游龍獨得廿三分，尤爲觀止。仁餘於最初曾有以十對〇領前之優勢，奈羽　未豐，經驗又遜，被世運平反時顯呈之慌亂，已爲大敗之兆，後防漏洞頻頻吳新運神射又失靈，僅樂嘉洲徐仲已勉撑殘局，以臨鋒鋩畢露之世運隊，遂造成一面倒之局勢。</p>
<p>仁餘　黃金時代</p>
<p>比賽於八時正開始，裁判吳子彬與祝明星。世運以李震中，黃天錫（衛），蔡文華（中鋒），李世僑于瑞章（鋒）出場，仁餘則以樂嘉洲，徐仲已（衛），姚文彝（中鋒），沈鵬舉，沈國政（鋒）應戰。徐仲已一罰，先開紀錄，姚文彝托入，三比〇，世運呼停，以吳成章替出于瑞章。樂嘉洲一投一罰，沈鵬舉再添一隻，世運二度呼停。李世僑初試啼聲，籃圈彈出，孫同政候個正着，長傳徐仲已，一盤一托，造成十比〇之優勢，爲仁餘之黃金時代。</p>
<p>世運　後來居上</p>
<p>五分鐘時，黃天錫遠射，方爲世運打破鴨蛋，又見世僑隻手托入，仁餘二次呼停，未能遏阻世運鋒鋩，世僑籃下梅開二度，大李一罰，阿弟一托，反以十二比十一超出。仁餘陣脚動搖，慌亂異常，雖以　新運調徐仲已，仍無起色。反觀世運，震中文華，屢投屢中，世僑遠射近偷，針針見血，仁餘僅小吳一隻「空心一。前半結束，廿七比十四，世運後來居上。</p>
<p>世僑　大為活躍</p>
<p>笛聲再起，世運大李阿弟倦勤，阿包小于入代，仁餘徐仲已重出，跳球後，文華連　帶罰，平添五分，阿包再加一隻，仁餘又停。姚文彝下野，文華又頻頻命中，李世僑出入仁餘禁地，干取于求，仁餘已無招架之力。六十一對廿九後，包松圓罰出，大李復入，仁餘小吳亦犯滿被黜，由莊逸　上塲。世僑仍大事活躍，矯掙靈活之身手，博得滿塲彩聲。迨千瑞章再添四分，時間已屆，世運遂以七十對卅四高奏凱歌。</p>
<p>上半時　世運廿七　仁餘十四</p>
<p>下半時　世運四三　仁餘二十</p>

<h3>現階段的　心理衛生運動</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>心理衛生運動，起源於美國，發動到現在正好三十年。當初患過精鉀病的庇亞斯（C．W．Beers）和心理學家詹姆士（William　James）以及精神病學家邁爾（Adolf　Meyer）發起美國康奈蒂克州心理衛生社的時候，他們決計想不到在短短的三十年中，心理衛生運動已經成爲一個逢蓬勃勃的普及全世界的運動，更想不到心理衛生甚至已經成爲一種專門的課程和學問了。</p>
<p>我國的心理衛生協會，在抗前一年曾有組織，勝利以後於去年十一月在南京重整旗鼓，舉行十年來沒有舉行過的年會。重慶的心理衛生協會，已經在最近成立，上海的心理衛生協會定於今日舉行全體會員大會，希望今後也能有一些切實的工作貢獻出來。</p>
<p>在起初，心理衛生運動的目標，不過是局限於防止心理病態和改善精神病人的待遇方面，後來才逐漸擴充到心理健康的促進和保持，但是充其量也不過是把心理衛生當做一種個人修養的工具而已。後來精神病學和兒童心理學比較發達，人們才注意到一個人的心理健康，是奠基於幼稚時期的，於是心理衛生便和兒童敎養以及學校敎育發生了密切的關係。近年來醫學界發現一個人的身體和精神，生理和心理，不但是息息相關，而且是無法分離的，因此更發創了一種新的學問，呌做「身心醫學」（Psychosomattic　medicine）這使心理衛生正式與醫學結了不解緣。</p>
<p>今年八月十六日到二十一日，國際心理衛生會議於聯合國經濟科學文化組織，和世界衛生紐織的贊助下，將在倫敦中央廳舉行全世界第三屆的會議。這次會議的議題，不但有關於個人的心理衛生，而且有關於家庭，工業。和社會的心理衛生，而主要的題目，却是關於「世界公民和民族良好關係的問題」。所以現階段的心理衛生運動，已經是一個有關國際睦誼和世界和平的軍要運動了。今後的心理衛生運動，將着眼於個人的修養和社會的安定以及世界和平的關係。心理衛生遝動已經走上了一條康莊大道了！</p>

<h3>辭藻與寫實</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>寫文章講究修辭學的人，常常推敲一字一句，煞費思索。從事翻譯工作者，亦有同感。倘用字不當，頗似隔靴擾　，譯者本人心癢癢的很覺難熬。某次，我見到了＂I　bad　done　a　good　and　noble　deed＂這樣一句，起初我譯爲「我已經做了一件高貴的好事」，深覺語氣牽强，後又改譯爲「我已經做了一件動機純正的好事，」雖較流利，仍覺未妥，祇好俟諸異日，覓得適當字眼後，再加修正。</p>
<p>過份重視修辭的結果，其極端則流於空洞的藻飾。且不說別的，以文心雕龍而論，這是我國文學批評史上一部傑作，讚起來雖然字字鏗鏘，但是同一層意義，必用軍複的句子來說明。其可取處大槪寓有一種對仗工整的美吧。任舉該書定勢　中的一節云：</p>
<p>「夫情致異區，文變殊術，莫不因情立體，即體成勢也。勢者乘利而爲制也，如機發矢直，澗曲湍回，自然之趣也。圓者規體，其勢也自轉；方者矩形，其勢也自安。文章體勢，如斯而已，是以模經爲式者，自入典雅之　，效騷命篇者，必歸豔逸之華，綜意淺切者，類乏蘊藉；斷辭辨約者，率乘繁縟。譬激水不漪，槁木無陰，自然之勢也。</p>
<p>這一節文字中，如「機發矢直」，「　曲湍回」，如「圓者規體，其勢也自轉」，如「方者矩形，其勢也自安」，如「激水不漪」一槁木無陰」，所表達的意思相仿，不免近乎疊床架屋之嫌，其要旨無非在說明寫文章，應順合文勢，不容矯揉造作而已。</p>
<p>寫實則與藻飾適得其反，不求字面的瑰麗，而注重事實的細節。我曾經聽到一位鄕居的舍親吿訴我某婦人因奸情被殺的一件實事，頗覺與在文字上做工夫者不同。這裏轉述於下，以充寫實的一例，如果讀者覺得尙可一讀，那還是因爲鄕親身歷其事，才能刻劃得有聲有色。</p>
<p>且說在四五年前，我的鄕親右鄰，住着一個女人，與駐紮當地的一個軍官有染，後來與另一男子往來，事爲軍官所聞，屢加勸誡，這女人始終置諸不理。有一天中午，舍親正在吃飯，隔墻突然傳來一片爭吵聲，接着聽到那女人「好哥哥」的一聲慘呌，遭該軍官用尖刀刺入她的咽喉，未幾便寂無聲息。片刻，那個軍官身上濺着鮮血，滿臉殺氣的從屋中趕出來。街上的行人，看到他那副兇神惡煞的模樣，也沒有人敢去攔截他，他向汽車站直奔，聽說轉輾逃到漢口，迄未弋獲，竟被他兎脫了。</p>
<p>這一件實事中「好哥哥」的一聲慘呌，與軍官脫逃的情形，非耳聞目睹者，不易嚮壁　稱。因此，鄙意過份講究藻飾，不如注意條辭，一味偏重條辭，不如在寫實上用工夫。就記事文和抒情文說來，惟有描寫逼眞，流露眞情，博得讀者共鳴者，方是天下一等的好文章。</p>
<h3>生財有道</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>一八六五年，美國支加哥地方開了一家新的戯院，但是營業不振，眼見得祇好關門了</p>
<p>但那戯院的老闆克洛斯佩氏却是一個極精明的商人，他一看情形不對，便靈機一動，宣布這家戯院已決定以抽籤的方法出實，他賣出了十八萬五千張吳劵，每張五元。抽籤典禮公開舉行的時候，全國都爲之轟動。克洛斯佩却不動聲色，向那位幸運的得主以廿萬元的代價把那家戯院重新買了回來。這時那家戯院已經因抽籤一舉而頗有名氣，好奇的看客紛至沓來，結果是營業蒸蒸日上，克落斯佩頓時大發其財，變成面團團的富家翁了。</p>
<h3>廟之種種</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>有神無廟——本市馬霍路口之二石翁仲，本在跑馬應內，後西人築屋，移之爲點綴品，不意善男信女，紛往焚香膜拜，且上區額，奉之爲神，然神無一橡之庇，是可謂有神無廟。</p>
<p>有廟有神——南京路之虹廟，即保安司徒廟也，每逢歲首，靑樓中人往往天未明競燒頭香，以卜利市，曩年吳友如畫寳，己繪圖以誌風俗，蓋具有悠久歷史矣。本市有廟有神者，指不勝屈，虹廟其代表之一也。</p>
<p>有廟無神——滬南製造局路有花神廟，供十二花神，花樹業中人，所以馨香俎豆焉。前歲廟之正屋，忽吿焚如，所謂十二花神，無不焦頭爛額，乃逕去之，不留跡象，迄今猶未修復，而廟之側屋，且闢爲學校，爲生徒弦誦之處矣。</p>
<p>無廟無神——南鬥內本有一福田庵，巨剎也，香火紫盛，不料住持某忽爲多金所動，乃以廟屋　之於人，神像送往他處，於是不僅無廟，且無神矣。</p>
<p>老廟老神——上海城隍廟，供奉先哲秦景容，始於元代至元廿九年，惟地址在今淡井廟，至明永樂年間，由邑宰張守約遷至城內，蓋將三國東吳孫皓所建之霍光行祠改建，其年代之久遠可知。今則不論婦孺，咸以老城隍廟呼之，此老廟老神也。</p>
<p>新廟新神——自抗戰軍興，城內外斷絕交通，托庇於外人租界者欲進香城隍廟，大感不便，於是投機者於淡水路別闢新城隍廟，塑像築廟，居然面目一新，遂有新城隍廟之號，此則新廟新神也。</p>
<h3>雲深處近句</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>謝邑令生紹會貽筆</p>
<p>筆陣馳驅弱好弄，當時下力五指痛！比來忽忽三十年，人言羊薄當伯仲。王生作宰我邑時，遺我霜毫豈有私，野淸會見野人頌，他日樹碑書去思！</p>

<h3>羅斯福的癖好</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>大家知道故羅斯福總統是政治家，政略家，殊不知道他也是大收藏家。有的人心目中以羅斯福收藏的是郵票和海軍學書籍居多，但事實上現在保存在海德公園（羅氏私邸所在）總統生前集藏的東西，不下二十餘類。從泳船到磁製小豬；從船的模型到小型書籍，形形色色都有。其　計書籍二萬五千册，海事小册六千本，三十一種期刋，各大日報的合訂本，雕刻的船數千套，兩百隻船舶模型，英美賀年片八大集，漫畫原稿，舊時石印書籍，還有不少請柬，餐單，泉幣，獎章和郵票。</p>
<p>羅斯福歡宣收藏，但並未走到沉迷的程度。他是利用這些東西調劑身心，以爲應付國家大事之餘的惟一休養。</p>
<p>羅斯福在收集郵票的時候，有一特別習慣，即在他出神整理郵票時，鼓起兩頰，把上下嘴唇擠成〇型，吹着無聲的口哨。當他把郵票隨意放入郵册中時，他反覆鼓起兩頰，反覆吹着。一個秘書因此問道：「總統先生，你是否是確實知道這些郵票放在什麼地方嗎？」他就說，「當然曉得，我已經有五十年經騐了！」原來他鼓起了嘴吹着無聲的口哨的意思是：「不要吵，跑出去，總統是在深思之中。」</p>
<p>在對德宣戰的早晨，他關照秘書即刻把總統府中許多初版書籍搬到海德公園去，以避轟炸，他認爲這種罕本書籍應該是屬於後代的，因此美政府最近已接受了他所獻出的書籍利收藏品。政府接受總統的收藏品是在一九三九年，羅氏並以　德公園十六畝地捐出作爲建造圖書館的基地。總統友好在紐約成立一羅斯福總統圖書館協會，在不到六個月內，募款三十七萬元，已足够建設此岡書館之需。一九三九年九月，總統親自奠就基石。今日，在圖書館中可以看到佈置和他生前一樣的一間書室。室中右角是他的辦公桌，有紀念物與照片頗多。</p>
<p>總統尙有二件癖好，一爲釣魚，一爲聽鳥聲而能猜出鳥類的名稱。現在陳列在圖書館中有三件東西可以表明他是一個漁人：一件灰色的舊上襖，一頂掛在衣廚裏的破損不堪的帽子，還有一條名貴的魚的標本。</p>
<p>赫貞河畔山谷中的鳥語在大戰最緊張時，無疑地對於總統是一種安慰與調劑。他會突然興至，跑到海德公園裏去找那個在圓書館裏研究的禽學家，約他在明天黎明到林間去猜辨鳥聲，作一次比賽。海德公園的一個鄰居和一批警衛人員在四周參觀巡視。淸晨四時，他們出發到預定地點，那個鄰人回憶着：</p>
<p>「我們抵達時天色尙黑，總統靜悄悄地坐着，好像恭聆盛大音樂會的演奏。等天色略顯魚白，他輕輕地說：聽好！這第一聲鳥呌……一隻畫眉！於是另一種鳥聲，他指出了這隻鳥名。他連續不斷一共指出了三十三種不同的鳥語！」</p>
<p>二小時後，羅斯福又肩起重任，面對着在烽火中艱困的時局了。</p>
<h3>西征圖詠</h3>
<p>— 衛人</p>
<p>前淸內廷供奉意傳敎士郞世寧，依我國口頭　，可以名之日「世故和尙」。何以名之？蓋此公旣已看破紅塵，偏肯不辭遠涉重洋，至馬可波羅奮游地之中國。其性格尤出凡離奇，出家人旣要作官，乃又雅擅丹靑，固不妨試而爲古典派藝術家。然此公不此之圖，玩起中國毛筆，不但傳神，更擬模古，甚而融貫中西，將「十全老人」乾隆皇帝哄得服服貼貼，郞繪八駿圖，久已蜚聲遐邇，而耗時六年，一筆不苟之乾隆征西岡，尤爲空前巨製。</p>
<p>征西圖共十六頁，每頁附以乾隆題咏，遂成爲有淸一代寳藏。此岡銅版雕製，似曾拓印御賜功臣將相，因此多有流傳，已非人間瑰寳矣。二十五年夏，予在瀋陽曾見數頁，當時索價法幣一百三十萬元，聞之昨舌，徒呼奈何而已。旋獲圖咏照片一全套，黃綾裝裱，前有「康德御題」「西被流沙，無思不服」八字，儼然王者氣象。然原版何在，殊不可知，今日何日，更難問訊。</p>
<p>圖中所描朔漠風光，全紙江南山水。但初淸咸儀，則刻劃入微，不惜筆墨。試看納降及歷役破敵諸幅，所謂「無思不服」望風披靡光景，眞可爲乾隆浪擲國帑好大喜功掩盡天下耳目。三海賜宴一幅，列列豚尾俯伏，乾隆御寳輦上，儀仗擁隨，鼓吹環奏，想漢高嘯歌大風之際，無以加之。午門受降，居高臨下，區區小醜，焉不股慄。至若盤馬彎弓軋將華旗之幅，當者辟易，受者捐軀，以今日之機械化部隊視之，可不多讓。惜乎嘉慶以下，席豐履厚，回溯開國之英武，已如隔世。溥儀以冲齡讓國，若能安分守己，尙不失其明哲保身地位。偏受敵奸挾持，演一幕傀儡悲喜劇，遂至東京受鞫，搖尾乞憐，東北三陵有知，寧不心痛！</p>
<p>把玩征西圖咏，有一再而三嘆之感，但不知異日溥儀將搖身一變，忽而面孔發赤，遺世人以四嘆之口實否？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>「赫爾回憶錄」風行大地之後，邱吉爾之「二次大戰回憶錄」亦已開始披露，此兩大名人之歷史性的回憶，足爲近代史之結品，以其人身為當時之當局，其書又詳細而平實，故一編在手，一切了然。</p>
<p>吾人回憶大戰之前及初起之兩年間，英相張伯倫之「敷衍政策」（Appeasing　poliey，或譯「綏靖政策」，責太冠冕，豈有一味委曲求全，卑躬屈節，而可謂之「綏靖」乎？改用「敷衍」二字。）徒使德之希魔氣燄增漲，馴至席捲歐陸，張伯倫慚報下台，邱吉爾繼相，與希特勒對壘，相持五年，千回百折，竟將希魔打倒。於英有起死回生之奇蹟，而功成身退，行所無事，如宋孟琪之隊儿獨居勳業外，漢馮異之退處大樹下，不與衆人爭，其風範殊不可及。當其勝利下野時，已傳從事著作，述所經歷，今果已寫成，興赫錄並爲「傳作」無疑。</p>
<p>回憶大戰時，雙方於砲火飛機炸彈之外，還有此些筆舌之鬥，刋物宣傳，希魔的魔臉，有歪曲的一撮毛，有凶氣之變目，火濁之氣，不可嚮邇。老邱則口銜雪茄，面含微笑，斜溜其同，閒雅其步，永遠是那副不慌不忙的神氣，大有以冷尅燥，以逸待勞之風度。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的好處是不諱其敗，只就損失之逐次减輕，轉敗爲勝之機樞，老老實實報吿其國民，即以增强其最後勝利之信心。其一九四一年四月二十七日在倫敦之廣播，値希臘派遣軍撤退，北非遭挫之後，並不諱言。希特勒於五月四日在其柏林國會演說，作爲對邱之答辯，除詛咒詈罵外，更斥爲謊言家，謂邱以挪威與鄧扣克兩役，尙能曲解爲英之勝利，以欺世人云云。吾人當時亦頗覺英國以敗退爲誇榜之不甚合理。至最後兩年中，乃知英之鄧扣克安全撤兵，保衛本土，確是反攻能力之暗示，與太平洋戰起，美軍退出關島，退出菲律賓，仍受美政府之褒獎，皆有軍略之理由，所謂「能敗」而後能勝。至於日德兩國，一團火氣，恰與覇王項羽相似，「七十二戰，戰無不利，忽聞楚歌，一敗塗地。」項羽亦是只可走順風，而經不起敗的一個怪物。</p>

Our army has completed its deployment around the periphery of Kaifeng. Now, I, the Commander-in-Chief, am personally directing the battle. I hope that the entire army and civilians will closely cooperate, calmly respond to the enemy, and achieve the effect of internal and external attacks, hoping to achieve unprecedented results." Liu returned to Xuzhou at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Kaifeng, 19th] The purpose of the Communist bandits invading Bian is to force the withdrawal of the Nationalist troops from Heze, in order to weaken the pressure of the Nationalist troops on the bandits in western Shandong. However, the bandits' attack on Bian has been frustrated. The Chen (Yi) bandits attacked the southeast corner of Kaifeng twice on the 19th, but were annihilated by the defending army. It is estimated that more than 1,500 bandits were killed and more than 120 captured. The main force of the eastern and western routes to rescue Kaifeng is advancing rapidly and should be able to relieve the siege within days.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 19th] The Air Force's Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Bohai Sea squadrons shuttle day and night to fly over Bian to assist the army in defending Bian. More than 200 Communist bandits entered Xiaodongmen in Bian city last night, and were all annihilated by the defending army by 3:00 PM today. (Another Dispatch) A major fire broke out in the Dongguan and Nanguan of Bian today. The war situation may change tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hankou, 19th] Military News: Liu (Deng's) Third and Sixth Columns are attempting to contain our army's reinforcements to Kaifeng from moving north, and are now maneuvering southwest of Tanghe. A section of the Pinghan Railway south of Zhumadian was destroyed by bandits on the 18th. After emergency repairs, traffic is expected to resume tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 19th] The remnant forces of the Chen (Yi) and Liu (Bocheng) bandits in western Shandong have been repeatedly and severely attacked by our army, suffering heavy casualties. Yesterday, they split into groups near Juye and fled south towards the areas of Dingtao, Cao County, and Kaocheng. Powerful Nationalist army groups are intercepting the bandits. The fighting is unprecedentedly fierce.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Bengbu, 19th] Bridges No. 82 and No. 126 between Fuliji and Xisipo on the Jinpu Railway were destroyed by bandits on the morning of the 19th, and traffic was immediately interrupted.

<h3>The Supervisory Yuan Passes a Temporary Motion to Request the President to Send Troops to Aid Bian</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] Supervisory Committee members Guo Zhongwei and 19 others from Yanji, proposed a temporary motion in the Supervisory Yuan on the 19th to "request the government to send troops to reinforce Kaifeng." It was unanimously resolved and sent to the President. The full text is as follows: "Upon investigation, the famous cities in the Central Plains are only Xu (zhou), Bian (Kaifeng), and Zheng (zhou). If Bian and Zheng are lost, Xuzhou will be isolated, and the situation in the Central Plains will be completely lost. It will be absolutely impossible to rely on the Yangtze River as a defense line. Recently, the treacherous bandits Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and others have taken advantage of the emptiness of the Kaifeng defense to concentrate more than four columns of troops to approach the suburbs of the city, and its demise is imminent. If Kaifeng is lost, southern China will be shaken, not only will these 600,000 people fall into a tragic calamity, but the capital will also be threatened, which will greatly affect the views of international figures, and the country's pacification plan will be frustrated. The future is unimaginable. It is imperative to request the government to quickly send a large army to rescue Kaifeng, and at the same time send a senior official to Zhengzhou to take charge and unify command to ensure the safety of the famous city, boost morale, and win the hearts of the people. The overall situation of the country depends on this move."</p>

<h3>Lei Zhen's Negotiations with the Youth Party Have Not Ended;</h3>
<p>Shi Zhiquan Has Sent a Telegram to the Capital Expressing Acceptance of the Nomination as Vice President of the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The negotiations between Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and Lei Zhen in Shanghai with the Youth Party still had no results yesterday. Zhang and Wu did not meet with the Youth Party representatives yesterday. Lei Zhen was solely responsible for the activities. Lei visited Zhang Junmai in the morning, attended a banquet hosted by Chen Qitian at noon, and participated in an internal consultation of the Youth Party on Haige Road at 4:00 PM, which ended at 8:00 PM. According to a member of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party, the resolution of the Central Standing Committee of the party is to hope that the number of Legislative Yuan members can be more than 20. If the problem of Legislative Yuan members is not resolved, they do not plan to participate in the Executive Yuan, and they do not plan to participate in the Judicial and Examination Yuans either. According to relevant sources, Zhang Qun's negotiations are aimed at both the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, but mainly at the Youth Party, because the Democratic Socialist Party's decision not to participate in the Executive Yuan cannot be changed, so they do not want to force them. In fact, there is no problem with the number of Legislative Yuan members for the Democratic Socialist Party. Lei Zhen hopes that the Youth Party will first send 10 Legislative Yuan members to attend the Legislative Yuan, and then continue to discuss other issues. Otherwise, if the situation becomes rigid again, no one will be willing to take responsibility for coordination.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Youth Party members reiterated the proposal that "the three parties should consult in advance when deciding on major issues related to national interests." They believe that if this principle is established, it will be a major guarantee for the continued cooperation of the three parties in the future, so they are very willing for the three parties to first discuss how to implement this principle. In addition to forwarding this opinion to Zhang Qun, Lei will return to the capital on the evening of the 20th. Zhang will stay in Shanghai for several days.</p>
<p>In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting of the Central Standing Committee this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Chen Bulei telegraphed Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Lei Zhen, and others in Shanghai today, asking them to sincerely express to friendly parties not to delay participation in various government departments due to the Legislative Yuan member issue, with the words "earnest sincerity, I hope to convey to the Youth Party friends, hoping for understanding of difficulties and early reply." It is also heard that Shi Zhiquan has telegraphed to the capital, expressing his acceptance of the nomination as Vice President of the Judicial Yuan.</p>

After accepting the mandate, Zhang decided to go south on a scheduled date.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The President of the Examination Yuan, Niu Yongjian, and Vice President Zhou Zhongyue, recently jointly telegraphed Zhang Boling, urging him to take office.</p>

<h3>The Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression in Central China is Established in Hankou; Directly Responsible to the President; Cheng Qian Will Serve as Director of the Changsha Pacification Office and Chairman of Hunan Province</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] After Bai Chongxi agreed to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Central China, he visited the President several times to ask for instructions on the Central China Bandit Suppression affairs and to carry out personnel deployments. The headquarters will be established in Hankou, and Bai will fly to Hankou to take office in a few days. The Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters is responsible to the President. Except for the President, who can give commands, the Ministry of National Defense and the Chief of Staff do not add any restrictions. The Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters will govern several army corps, which are currently being organized. In addition, in order to completely eliminate the scattered bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, a Pacification Office will be established in Changsha, with Cheng Qian as the director. Cheng will also serve as the Chairman of Hunan Province. The official order will be issued soon.</p>

<h3>The Legislative Principles for the Temporary Property Tax Case Have Been Established; The Starting Point for Taxation is RMB 30,000 Based on Pre-War Property Value; Three Committee Members Are Appointed to Draft the Articles</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The Temporary Property Tax and Investigation of Powerful Families' Capital Subcommittee of the Finance and Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan met on the morning of the 19th to continue reviewing the temporary property tax case proposed by Liu Butong, with Convening Committee Member Jian Guansan presiding. Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department of the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, was also invited to attend. After heated discussions, the following principles were decided: (1) The method of taxation combines personal jurisdiction and property jurisdiction, using the technology of finding property through people and finding people through property, depending on the situation. (2) The starting point for taxation is RMB 30,000 based on the property value in 1937, adjusted according to the price index. (3) The tax rate is progressive for both natural persons and legal persons, but legal persons engaged in production businesses are given differential treatment. The highest tax rate in Liu's original proposal of 60% should be reduced in principle. (4) The taxation procedure starts with big businessmen in large cities, and reporting and investigation should be started as soon as possible, and methods such as reporting, nomination, and informing should be adopted. The central government should form a central supervision committee composed of the Legislative, Supervisory, and Judicial Yuans, and the local government should form a local supervision committee composed of universities, middle schools, journalists' associations, public opinion institutions, and judicial organs. (5) The property of foreigners in China and the property of Chinese people abroad are all subject to taxation. So far, all the legislative principles have been established. Finally, Jian Guansan, Liu Butong, and Cui Jingbo were appointed to draft the articles of the regulations based on this, and submit them to the committee for discussion and decision, and then report the adjournment.</p>
<h3>The Review Procedure for the General Budget Case is Divided into Five Steps</h3>
<p>The First Session of the Legislative Yuan Will Be Extended Again</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The procedural case for the Legislative Yuan's review of the national general budget case for the second half of 1948 has been decided.

The budget case is still being rushed to compile in the Executive Yuan.

Shi also said: A large amount of capital from the Northeast has recently flowed to Beiping and Tianjin, and at the same time, the Shanghai exchange is not open, which has formed the current serious economic situation in North China. He has recently cabled Shanghai to urge the National Bank to quickly send senior officials to the north to discuss a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>The Currency Reform Issue is Being Studied by China and the United States; Chen Lifu Tells American Reporters in Washington</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Chen Lifu told reporters at the Chinese Embassy in the United States on the 18th that the currency reform issue related to the US aid to China plan is currently being studied and explored informally by the governments of China and the United States. Chen said that Chinese economists and financiers have long been working on ways to reform the economic situation and have formulated many currency reform plans. However, Chen pointed out that whether based on the gold standard or restoring the use of silver coins, the plan can only succeed when the situation becomes more stable. He also said: Before starting any currency reform, a certain degree of currency stability must be achieved, but this stability can only be achieved by making good use of domestic resources and property and improving the general situation. Asked whether the $125 million in military aid to China, which is being considered in parallel with the economic aid to China plan, is sufficient to suppress the communists, Chen said that this number is not small, but it is still not enough.</p>
<h3>The Fifth General Assembly of the Supervisory Yuan Passes the Supervisory Law Draft; It Will Be Sent to the Legislative Yuan to Request Prompt Completion of the Legislative Process</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The entire draft of the Supervisory Law was discussed, revised, and passed at the fifth meeting held by the Supervisory Yuan on the morning of the 19th, and it was immediately resolved that: "The draft of the Supervisory Law has been revised and passed, and the Yuan will send it to the Legislative Yuan, requesting that it promptly complete the legislative process so that it can exercise its powers." This fundamental law draft of the Supervisory Yuan has finally been initially completed. (The full text of the Supervisory Law draft is published on the second page).</p>
<p>Morning Session</p>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan held its fifth meeting all day today. The morning session began at 9:00 AM, chaired by Yuan President Yu Youren. The discussion began with the draft Supervisory Law passed by the plenary review committee. First, Tian Jiongjin explained the review process, and then the articles were discussed one by one. By the time the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM, only the four articles of the first chapter, General Principles, had been passed, because two points caused heated debate. One was whether the power of correction should be included in the Supervisory Law. First, Committee Member Zhang Weihan believed that the constitution did not make a clear provision for the power of correction, so it should not be included in the supervisory power. Some people believed that although the constitution did not explicitly stipulate it, it was certain that there was a power of correction within the supervisory power, or it was possible that there was a loophole in the constitution. During the vote, those who advocated maintaining the original proposal still had more. Secondly, when discussing the Executive Office of the Supervisory Committee, some people proposed the necessity of establishing Executive Offices of the Supervisory Committee overseas. After a longer period of discussion, it was still passed according to the original draft.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session</p>
<p>The afternoon session continued at 3:30 PM, first chaired by Yu Youren. After the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM, Yu retired in advance. At this time, Vice President Liu Zhe was also absent due to business. Tian Jiongjin was publicly elected to preside over the meeting. In the afternoon's discussion, the focus was still on adding the establishment of Executive Offices of the Supervisory Committee overseas to Article 5. Many speakers, mostly in terms of emotion and reason, supported the establishment of Executive Offices overseas, but few supported it in terms of law and reason. The discussion was then decided to be carried out by resolution, and the resolution was as follows: "After this case has completed the legislative process by the Legislative Yuan, regarding the implementation of Article 5, it is planned to ask the government to allocate funds and send personnel to inspect foreign countries as soon as possible." This is to supplement the intention to establish Executive Offices overseas. After Article 5 and its resolution were passed, the progress was extremely smooth, and only a few revisions were encountered in the chapter on "Investigation," which were discussed for a long time. Also, when discussing the chapter on "Power of Correction," the original article specified the designated investigation target as "the work and facilities of the Executive Yuan and its subordinate agencies at all levels." Some committee members believed that the target was too small, inevitably causing institutions outside this scope to be omitted from the law, and firmly advocated adding the Judicial and Examination Yuans outside the Executive Yuan to expand the target and scope of the exercise of the power of impeachment. However, they ultimately failed to pass due to receiving a small number of votes during the vote. The meeting ended at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahua Flies to Jinan for Inspection</h3>

<h3>The Special Envoy Returns to the Capital Today; Yesterday, He Attended the Qingdao Alumni Meeting and Went Swimming in the Sea</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Qingdao, 19th] The special envoy is staying at the official residence of Bail in Qingdao and is not receiving guests. Yesterday, he and Mr. and Mrs. Bail drove around the city.

<h3>Allowing American Aid Ships to Sail to Jinghan is Not Opening Up Inland Water Navigation Rights; A Diplomatic Figure Makes a Statement on Legal Principles; Jiujiang May Also Be Granted Special Permission for American Ships to Enter and Exit</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] A reporter recently asked a diplomatic figure whether Nanjing and Hankou will be opened as inland river ports to facilitate the transportation of American aid supplies, allowing American ships to navigate the Yangtze River to unload or load cargo at the two ports. He replied: This special permission is not what is called "opening up inland water navigation rights." Inland water and coastal navigation rights refer to foreign ships navigating between inland river or coastal ports in our country to load or unload cargo. If a foreign ship sails to our country, unloads part of its cargo at any port or territorial waters open to foreign trade and navigation, and then transports the remaining cargo to any of the above-mentioned ports and territorial waters; or loads cargo in the same way at any of the above-mentioned ports and territorial waters upon departure, from a legal point of view, it cannot be regarded as "opening up inland river or coastal navigation rights." This situation is recorded very clearly in Article 24 of the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, and it is not allowed for anyone to distort it to damage the government's prestige. After the victory, the transportation of UNRRA relief supplies was also granted special permission by our government, allowing foreign ships carrying relief supplies to directly enter designated ports along the Yangtze River to unload and load cargo. Now, in order to facilitate the transport of American aid supplies and to reduce the expensive labor costs of transshipment and the loss of time and supplies, it is proper to take short-term measures by means of special permission. Under these circumstances, it is not only necessary to open the ports of Jinghan, but also Jiujiang may be the port for American aid ships to enter and unload cargo and for inland products to be exported and loaded onto ships. However, he declined to reveal whether this measure will be included in the bilateral agreement between China and the United States regarding the implementation of the aid to China plan, but said that it would be more convenient not to include it than to include it.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Does Not Comply with Anti-Smuggling Agreement; We Will Make Demands to Change Hong Kong's Status</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] An absolutely reliable government source told the United Press on the 19th that China feels Hong Kong is not complying with the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement. Therefore, if Chinese funds continue to flow out illegally, China may demand a change in Hong Kong's status in the short term. China and Hong Kong concluded a treaty in Nanjing a few months ago to jointly prevent smuggling. However, Chinese funds are still flowing out to Hong Kong, especially from Shanghai and Guangdong, which China considers "smuggling" in violation of the agreement. The Chinese economy has two major incurable diseases: one is the outflow of idle capital from North China to Shanghai, and the other is the rush of idle capital from Shanghai and Guangdong into Hong Kong. The Chinese government believes that this will "drain China's lifeblood," but the Hong Kong authorities have not made sufficient efforts to cooperate and stop it. The Chinese government knows that a direct request to take back Hong Kong might be immediately rejected by Britain. Subsequently, China might submit the matter to the United Nations, but this is unlikely to succeed, as Britain can be expected to control enough votes to veto China's request.</p>
<p>Authoritative sources point out that due to increasing pressure from public opinion, especially from the business community, China will demand representation in the Hong Kong government with sufficient power to stop smuggling. "Of course, the concentration of idle capital is beneficial to Hong Kong, but we feel that the Hong Kong government should comply with the anti-smuggling agreement in both letter and spirit, and we should strengthen cooperation on matters of mutual concern to China."</p>

<h3>Reorganizing Morality and Promoting Our National Culture</h3>
<p>— Fan Guang</p>
<p>Dr. Brookman of the United States initiated a grand gathering, the "John Hay Fellowship" commencing June 3rd in Los Angeles, with participants from over thirty countries worldwide. Our nation was also represented by Vice President Chen of the Legislative Yuan. This indeed offers a major turning point to stem the tide and salvage this immense disaster. The basis of this undertaking lies in the culmination of several millennia of ethical and moral civilization in our nation. Since Westernization permeated the East, people embraced European values, prioritizing profit and seeking quick success. Yet, a conference dedicated to reorganizing morality originated among people of the United States, a land with extremely advanced material civilization. They understood the source of the problem. It also shows the depth of their academic research, enabling them to trace back to the source and find the true foundation.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of our culture, China has promoted morality, regarding it as the goal of learning, the means to cultivate oneself, the foundation for regulating the family, and the basis for governing the state. For millennia, this has been nurtured and grown, permeating the entire nation and becoming the essence of our national heritage. 道 (Dao) and 德 (De) are two different aspects: Dao is the natural order of things in daily life, while 德 (De) is the cultivation of Dao, resulting in inner attainment. The Zhou Shu states, "Dao encompasses talent, while 德 (De) enables personal practice." Lao Tzu said, "Dao gives birth to it, and 德 (De) nurtures it. Therefore, all things respect Dao and value 德 (De)." The Great Learning states, "The Way of Great Learning consists in manifesting the clear virtue." Mencius said, "When the world is governed by Dao, minor virtues serve greater virtues." He also said, "To subdue people with 德 (De) is to win their hearts and sincere submission." The Analects states, "Guide them by government decrees and regulate them by punishments, and the people will avoid wrongdoing but have no sense of shame. Guide them by virtue and regulate them by ritual, and they will have a sense of shame and also reform themselves." This kind of morality is the highest philosophy for seeking peace and stability in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad.</p>
<p>Since the world abandoned Dao, lost sight of morality, and prioritized profit, it opened the door to opportunities for killing, leading to endless wars and chaos. Mencius said, "When those above and those below compete for profit, the nation is in danger." Today, the world competes for profit; how can the world not be in danger! It is fitting to echo Mencius's words to King Hui of Liang, saying, "Let there be benevolence and righteousness; why must you speak of profit?" If we can truly revive morality and implement the four principles advocated by the conference—honesty, selflessness, impartiality, and universal love—and further expand and enrich them, with individuals relying on them as their guide and nations using them as the basis for governance, then the pursuit of profit will be curbed, and the world will be stable. However, politics is rooted in civilization. Today, the world's civilization is a grand trend of both material and spiritual aspects. Western civilization focuses solely on developing material aspects. Our civilization, in ancient times, originally developed both spiritual and material aspects. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, numerous schools of thought emerged, discussing both vertical and horizontal strategies. Material inventions also reached their peak. Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor, sought to establish a dynasty for ten thousand generations. Material civilization easily makes one forget one's country, so he suppressed scholars and forged alliances. Material civilization flowed from Asia Minor to the West. Thus, the West has developed material civilization for generations, reaching its peak today. However, the monarchs of our country throughout history have imitated Qin Shi Huang's old tricks, confining the people and deceiving the masses, regarding material things as inferior learning and despising them as ingenious skills. Thus, we have only maintained our spiritual civilization. Since the opening of the sea ban at the end of the Qing Dynasty, we have realized the inadequacy of our material civilization to cope with the situation. So we competed to open schools and send students abroad to absorb material knowledge. Meanwhile, Western scholars have gradually come into contact with our culture. Those who have studied it deeply have come to understand the profundity and greatness of our national spiritual civilization.</p>
<p>In books and arguments, it is often said that if one wants to seek true peace and happiness in other parts of the world, one must seek guidance from Chinese culture. Since the West primarily focuses on material things, it emphasizes profit, and its recent theories, such as survival of the fittest and the strong preying on the weak, all promote contention. The world's material resources are limited, but human desires are infinite. Once dissatisfied, people will fight with each other, and nations will fight with each other. The disaster for humanity will be great. However, our spiritual culture for thousands of years has been purely focused on cultivating virtue, practicing benevolence and righteousness, and seeking only spiritual satisfaction, not material things. Confucius said, "If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die content in the evening." He also said, "The noble man concerns himself with the Way, not with food." Yan Hui lived in a humble lane, eating from a bamboo bowl and sleeping with his arm as a pillow, which others could not bear, but Yan Hui did not change his joy. Yuan Xian lived in a small room with a wobbly door, using a broken window as a pillow, but he did not consider it a hardship. When Zilu was offered the position of prime minister, he declined. When Chu offered him a position as a minister, he also declined, preferring to be poor rather than compromise his integrity. When the King of Chu offered him gold and silk, his wife left him, but his health improved day by day. They all knew to believe in Dao, cultivate virtue, seek spiritual peace, and despise material things, not considering them important. Therefore, they did not contend with others. Zhao Pu governed the world with half of the Analects, but in reality, his knowledge was shallow; he had not yet heard of the Way of the noble man. The first chapter of the Great Learning states, "The Way of Great Learning consists in manifesting the clear virtue, in renovating the people, and in resting in the highest excellence." Its actions are to investigate things, extend knowledge, make the will sincere, rectify the heart, cultivate the self, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world. Just this one chapter is enough to govern the world. The so-called cultivation of the self is the practice of Dao and humility. To govern the state and pacify the world is to assimilate one's own destiny to the nation and the world.</p>
<p>The reason why 道 (Dao) allows easy governance is because 道 (Dao) and concession are inherent in people. The governors only need to guide the people to assimilate, and they will naturally assist each other. In our history, countless foreign races have invaded our borders, but they were soon assimilated by us. Throughout history, the Five Barbarians caused chaos, the Turks invaded, the Khitans brought disaster to Jin, the Jurchens destroyed Song, and the Yuan Dynasty ruled. Before long, they were all assimilated by us and their races perished. The Qing people replaced the Ming Dynasty, ruling the country for three hundred years, but today the Manchus have been assimilated. Our ethical civilization is highly influential and has great assimilative power. Those who are exposed to it are naturally assimilated into this great melting pot. Now that we need to absorb material civilization, and the West feels the need for our culture, the 20th century is truly a grand meeting of the two major civilizations of the world. We should seize this good opportunity, ride the tide, and promote our Chinese culture to the world so that everyone can rectify their hearts and cultivate themselves, and every family can be regulated, and every state can be governed. The world of Great Harmony described by Confucius can be realized. With uniform writing, uniform laws, and uniform ethics, the world will be one family. What need is there for contention? Therefore, the day the world accepts our culture is the day true peace will be realized. And humanity can be saved and enjoy the ideal happiness of life.</p>
<p>In short, cultivating 道 (Dao) is the essential foundation for cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, pacifying the world, and achieving the Great Harmony. Therefore, in today's chaotic world where human desires run rampant, reorganizing morality is a great hope for addressing current issues and saving the world from imminent danger. However, those who are accustomed to material civilization will only have occasional inspiration. Guiding and directing the effort and helping to bring about recovery depends on us who are familiar with this 道 (Dao). Therefore, I believe that we should seize the opportunity, and immediately organize a Central Culture Institute to promote our national culture to the world as a major new policy to save the country, save the people, and save the world. At the same time, we should respond to the Americans' proposal and quickly organize a Chinese Association for the Reorganization of Morality in our country to echo them and leverage their efforts. Furthermore, our representatives should advocate making the association a permanent organization to guide the reorganization of morality. This is a good opportunity to promote our nation's spiritual culture to the world. We must not miss it. I hope that there are many wise people both in and out of government who will not dismiss these words.</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Power Supply Plan</h3>
<p>To Be Submitted to U.S. Aid Technical Mission</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 19th] The western Taiwan power supply system is now capable of generating 130,000 kilowatts, not far from the peak of 150,000 kilowatts during the Japanese occupation.

Manufacturers from Shanghai, Tianjin, Peiping, and other inland areas hope to establish various consumer chemical industries in Taiwan and are clamoring for power. According to Huang Chan, assistant manager of the Taiwan Power Company, the current power demand has reached 50,000 kilowatts. The Taiwan Provincial Government has decided to increase power generation by 100,000 kilowatts within three years, completing the Taileng, Wulan, Wushe, and San power plants, at an estimated cost of US$6 million. A plan has been drafted and is ready for reference by the upcoming U.S. Aid Technical Survey Mission, and hopes are high.</p>

<h3>West Germany Implements Currency Reform, Soviet Union Takes Countermeasures, Orders Blockade of Railway and Highway Traffic, Declares Division of Germany Completed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The Soviet authorities in Germany have issued a declaration signed by Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet forces, announcing that the unilateral implementation of currency reform in West Germany by the Western Allies has completed the division of Germany. Simultaneously with this declaration, the Soviet military government ordered the prohibition of trains, highways, passenger transport, and pedestrians from entering the Soviet occupation zone from West Germany, as well as the prohibition of new [currency] from being imported into the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet military government clarified that this new order does not affect air traffic, and although freight transport by rail and canal is not prohibited, it will be subject to stricter supervision. Telephone and postal services between West Germany and the Soviet occupation zone are also not affected. However, the declaration also stated that other measures will be taken at any time as the situation requires. Sokolovsky's declaration not only announced the completion of the division of East and West Germany but also stated that the existence of two German currencies within Germany would make domestic trade relations, as well as trade between the West and the Soviet occupation zone, practically equivalent to trade between two countries. The full text of Marshal Sokolovsky's declaration reads: "The unilateral implementation of currency reform by the Western countries is contrary to the will and interests of the German people and is only implemented for the benefit of the monopolistic capitalists of the United States, Britain, and France. The unilateral implementation of currency reform has completed the division of Germany and has clearly violated the Potsdam Agreement and the Allied Control Agreement for Germany, which stipulate that Germany should be regarded as an economic unit. The Western powers, using the impossibility of agreeing on a four-power currency reform for the whole of Germany as an excuse to justify their unilateral actions, are implementing their policy of dividing Germany with the support of the American, British, and French monopolistic capitalists, who once supported fascism and initiated World War II, and the large German capitalists. The unilateral currency reform strengthens the political and economic position of these reactionaries and only harms the working class."</p>
<h3>East Germany Postpones Currency Reform, Decisions Dependent on West Germany's Situation, Soviet Representative Refuses to Attend Joint Command Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 19th Broadcasting: Berlin News, it is reported that the Soviet military commander in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany has accepted the opinion of the German Economic Commission in the Soviet occupation zone, that the currency reform in East Germany will be postponed pending clarification of the status of Berlin. According to Soviet officials, the Soviet side is unwilling to act alone in reforming the currency in East Germany and must cooperate with the responsible German parties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The Soviet side has already stated that it cannot attend the special meeting of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command (Four-Power Berlin Military Government) to be held on the 19th to consider currency reform. The Soviet military commander in Berlin, Yelisarov, sent a letter to General Garnaud of France, the chairman of the current meeting of the Joint Command, expressing his regret for his inability to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>He also stated that the Soviet occupation authorities had already stated their views on the issue of currency reform. According to the Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet Union, the British military government chief has flatly rejected Sokolovsky's welcome to the four powers to jointly reform the currency.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The German People's Congress, regarded as the "shadow cabinet" of the future East German government, held an emergency meeting at noon on the 19th in the Soviet zone of Berlin. The Berlin City Council is also scheduled to hold a special meeting on Monday to discuss the situation caused by the implementation of currency reform in West Germany. The German Economic Commission in the Soviet zone was summoned to Sokolovsky's headquarters at midnight on the 18th for a meeting. Afterwards, a commissioner claimed, "We will continue to strive to maintain the appearance of German unity by continuing trade between East and West." According to reliable sources, because the currency reform in West Germany does not include Berlin, activities between districts in Berlin will not be restricted for the time being before the Soviet Union announces its decision on currency reform in East Germany.</p>
<h3>West Germany Supervises Implementation of New Economic Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 18th] Bennett, the chief financial advisor to the U.S. military government, said that it is now too late to discuss a four-power joint currency reform, but he still hopes to restore trade relations with the Soviet zone soon. He expects a large number of unemployment to occur in West Germany within six months after the implementation of currency reform. The German side's reaction is that although they feel that currency reform is an unpleasant move, it is also a necessary measure. According to Frankfurt Radio, the West German police will supervise the smooth implementation of the currency reform plan, and interference will be imposed on shops that refuse to sell goods. A telegram from Düsseldorf said that holders of old currency are eager to get rid of it and are willing to pay a high price of 3,000 marks (equivalent to £75) to buy a pound of coffee. The black market price of British and American cigarettes is 40 marks, equivalent to £1.</p>
<h3>No Impact on Salaried Class, Speculators Hit Hardest</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] British economist Webb gave a speech to the German people tonight, saying, "The currency reform law has been carefully considered to ensure that the burden is fair. The new law protects civilians and will not tolerate wartime speculators." The initial phenomenon of currency reform in West Germany is that the general salaried class has little savings on weekdays, and the losses are not large. The middle class's deposits have suffered significant losses, and those who depend on savings or interest for a living may have to look for work. The wealthy class is prone to bankruptcy, especially wartime profits. Black market traders have no way out in the future. If they do not burn their banknotes, they can only find a way to explain the source of income to the authorities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 19th] British financial experts claim that the good results of currency reform in West Germany depend on the sufficient supply of materials under the Marshall Aid Plan and the announcement of a new tax system after the reform. The new tax system will benefit the poorer classes in Germany. Without these two factors, the currency reform in West Germany will be the most painful currency reform for the people in post-war Europe.</p>

<p>[United Press, Helmstedt, 19th] The British army dispatched ten armored vehicles to this area today, while the Soviet authorities drove back hundreds of travelers trying to enter Berlin.

<h3>Poland Protests West German Agreement to U.S. Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Poland yesterday protested to the United States against the decision of the Western countries to establish a West German government, believing that the London Six-Power Agreement violated the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements. The note was delivered by Polish Ambassador Winiewicz to U.S. Undersecretary of State Armor. Winiewicz later told reporters that the Six-Power Agreement gave Germany the right to recover before its neighboring countries that had suffered from the ravages of war, and disregarded Poland's views on the German issue, which Poland could not recognize.</p>

The Arab League Political Committee also decided not to hold a round table conference with the Jewish representatives but only agreed to send several experts to Rhodes Island. The Arab League Political Committee also decided to oppose the extension of the Palestinian truce. If the negotiations for a fair solution unfortunately break down, the Arabs will resume fighting. According to a telegram from Rhodes Island, Bernadotte said after arriving on the island from Tel Aviv today that there was no political round table conference on the island. The Jewish and Arab personnel who arrived on the island after him were only experts and had no power to make resolutions. Bernadotte frankly admitted that it was too early to hope for a symbol of peace at present.

<h3>U.S. Foreign Aid Bill in Stalemate, Two Houses Reconvene Last Night, Satisfactory Solution Still Has Last Hope</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 19th Broadcasting: Washington News: The U.S. Senate met for 18 hours today to discuss various important unfinished matters before Congress adjourned. The tension was unprecedented in the history of the Senate except for the debate on the U.S. joining the League of Nations. While the Senate was in session, Senate President Vandenberg and House Speaker Martin held a secret meeting to seek a compromise on the amount of foreign aid funds. As a result, it was decided to convene a joint meeting again tonight. The result is highly regarded. If there is still no solution when Congress adjourns, the Marshall Plan will be in a stalemate. Or the Senate may compromise and finally accept the House's reduction method, which would also be enough to affect the effectiveness of the Marshall Plan, as Ma Qing pointed out. However, since the joint meeting is being reconvened, there is still hope for a satisfactory solution in time.</p>

<h3>Socialite Ren Wenzhi Attempts Suicide by Taking Sleeping Pills; Affair Troubles and Economic Hardship; Her Father Attributes Suicide to These Reasons</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Ren Wenzhi, a socialite who is active in the luxurious entertainment venues of Shanghai and who is listed as one of the so-called "socialites" alongside Xia Danwei, Shi Danping, and Xiang Moying, recently took more than a dozen sleeping pills to commit suicide in a room at the Huizhong Hotel on Nanjing Road. She was discovered and rushed to Gongji Hospital for treatment, but has not yet been pulled from danger.</p>
<p>Ren is from Suzhou and is 28 years old. She previously studied at Yancheng Middle School in that county. She, Xiang Moying, Su Xuan, and others were all classmates. After coming to Shanghai, she changed her name to Wang Ying and danced at the Paramount. She then became active in social circles with her close friends because they were like-minded. Her father, Ren Xuequan, worked under Lu Bohong and also worked for the Shanghai Datong Dada Shipping Company for a time. He recently retired due to his age and lives with his daughter and a maid at No. 58 Tianjiafang, Xiqiao Street. Ren also has a younger brother named Liansheng who is studying at the Suzhou Academy of Fine Arts. On the 18th, Ren suddenly had a quarrel with her father for unknown reasons, and went out at 6:00 PM with her cousin, Miss Dongbao. At 11:30 PM, they passed the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. Ren entered the hotel because her close friend, Su Xuan, lived in Room 525 on the fifth floor of the hotel. She also checked into Room 408 under the name of Wang Ying. That night, she summoned Su to her room to pour out her grievances and revealed that she was tired of life. After Su persuaded her in many ways, she took Miss Dongbao to bed on the fifth floor, leaving Ren alone in the room. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM yesterday, when Su went downstairs and knocked on the door, there was no sound inside, and the door was locked by Ren. She quickly called the servant to find a way to open the door, and saw Ren lying on the bed in a printed silk cheongsam, unconscious. There was an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the table. Knowing that she had taken poison, she called an ambulance to send Ren to Gongji Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, she was sent to Ward CM14 on the third floor. It was found that Ren's pupils had shrunk. She was given acupuncture and medicine to induce vomiting and diarrhea. Although the situation improved slightly, she was still unable to speak and has not yet been pulled from danger.</p>
<p>Before the incident, it was heard that Ren had left a suicide note, but the contents are unknown. Her father said that it was because the house she lived in at Tianlefang had recently been taken over by a second landlord, who intended to force them to move out, but due to economic hardship, they had nowhere to find a house, which caused Ren to repeatedly clash with the second landlord and led to this desperate measure.</p>

<h3>Ruins of Penglai Market Call Again for Promotion of National Goods: National Goods Exhibition Opens Yesterday</h3>

Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Assembly, presided over the ceremony, reported on the preparations, and stated in his address that Penglai Market was destroyed during the war and has not yet been rebuilt. Holding a national goods exhibition on this site today and reiterating the call to promote national goods is truly thought-provoking.

Exhibiting national goods on the ruins of Penglai Market shows our determination to revitalize the Southern District.

Currently, the only way to encourage production and fundamentally save industry and commerce is to promote national goods as an active countermeasure. Subsequently, Mr. Huan Yanglun, representative of Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Tan Yimin, representative of Chief Commissioner Fang of the City Party Department, Mr. Zhang Zhenyuan, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Mr. Tian Heqing, representative of the Industrial Association, successively delivered speeches.

<h3>世運發揮威力　仁餘遭逢慘敗　七十比卅四形勢一面倒</h3>
<p>The World Games Team Displays Power, Renyu Suffers a Crushing Defeat: A One-Sided Score of 70 to 34</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Last night, the World Games basketball team reversed its listless performance in the first game, displaying unparalleled power and inflicting a severe defeat on Feng Renyu. The final score was 70 to 34, with the halftime score at 27 to 14. The players performed exceptionally well, reaching the peak of their abilities, and their coordination was perfect. Li Shiqiao's passing, dribbling, and shooting were particularly impressive, scoring 23 points and captivating the audience. Renyu initially had a 10-0 lead, but lacking sufficient maturity and experience, they became flustered when the World Games team fought back, foreshadowing their defeat. Frequent loopholes in their defense and the failure of Wu Xin's accurate shooting allowed the World Games team, with their sharp attacks, to create a one-sided situation.</p>
<p>The Golden Age of Renyu</p>
<p>The game started at 8:00 p.m., with Wu Zibin and Zhu Mingxing as referees. The World Games team started with Li Zhenzhong and Huang Tianxi (guards), Cai Wenhua (center), and Li Shiqiao and Yu Ruizhang (forwards).

Yao Wenyi dribbled in, making it 3-0. The World Games team called a timeout, replacing Yu Ruizhang with Wu Chengzhang. Le Jiazhou scored on a shot and a free throw, and Shen Pengju added another point, giving Renyu a 10-0 lead, marking the golden age of Renyu.</p>
<p>The World Games Team Comes from Behind</p>
<p>Five minutes into the game, Huang Tianxi scored a long shot, breaking the World Games team's scoreless streak. Then, Shiqiao scored with one hand. Renyu called a second timeout, but failed to stop the World Games team's momentum. Shiqiao scored twice under the basket, Da Li scored on a free throw, and A Di dribbled in, reversing the score to 12-11. Renyu's formation wavered, and they were in disarray. Although Xu Zhongyi was brought in to replace Wu Xin, there was no improvement. On the other hand, the World Games team, with Zhenzhong and Wenhua, scored repeatedly. Shiqiao's long shots and steals were accurate. Renyu only had one "air ball" from Xiao Wu. The first half ended with the World Games team leading 27-14, coming from behind.</p>
<p>Shiqiao is Very Active</p>
<p>The whistle blew again. Da Li and A Di of the World Games team were tired, and A Bao and Xiao Yu came in as replacements. Xu Zhongyi of Renyu re-entered the game. After the jump ball, Wenhua added five points with a shot and a free throw. A Bao added another point, and Renyu called another timeout. Yao Wenyi was substituted, and Wenhua continued to score frequently. Li Shiqiao entered and exited Renyu's restricted area, grabbing every opportunity. Renyu had no way to resist. After the score became 61-29, Bao Songyuan was fouled out, and Da Li re-entered. Xiao Wu of Renyu was also fouled out and replaced by Zhuang Yi. Shiqiao was still very active, and his agile skills won applause from the entire audience. When Qian Ruizhang added another four points, time had run out, and the World Games team triumphantly won with a score of 70-34.</p>
<p>First Half: World Games 27, Renyu 14</p>

<h3>現階段的　心理衛生運動</h3>
<p>The Mental Hygiene Movement at its Current Stage</p>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The mental hygiene movement originated in the United States and has been underway for exactly thirty years. When C.W. Beers, who had suffered from mental illness, the psychologist William James, and the psychiatrist Adolf Meyer founded the Connecticut Society for Mental Hygiene, they never imagined that in just thirty years, the mental hygiene movement would become a flourishing and widespread movement throughout the world. They even less imagined that mental hygiene would become a specialized course and field of study.</p>
<p>The Chinese Mental Hygiene Association had an organization before the War of Resistance, and after the victory, it reorganized in Nanjing last November, holding its first annual meeting in ten years. The Chongqing Mental Hygiene Association has recently been established, and the Shanghai Mental Hygiene Association is scheduled to hold its general membership meeting today, hoping to contribute some practical work in the future.</p>
<p>Initially, the goal of the mental hygiene movement was limited to preventing mental illness and improving the treatment of the mentally ill. Later, it gradually expanded to the promotion and maintenance of mental health, but at best, it was only considered a tool for personal cultivation. Later, with the development of psychiatry and child psychology, people realized that a person's mental health is based on early childhood. Thus, mental hygiene became closely related to child rearing and school education. In recent years, the medical community has discovered that a person's body and mind, physiology and psychology, are not only closely related, but also inseparable. Therefore, a new discipline called "Psychosomatic medicine" was created, which officially linked mental hygiene with medicine.</p>
<p>From August 16 to 21 this year, the International Mental Hygiene Conference, sponsored by the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Health Organization, will hold its third global meeting in Central Hall, London. The agenda of this conference will not only cover personal mental hygiene, but also family, industrial, and social mental hygiene. The main topic, however, will be "the problem of good relations between world citizens and nations." Therefore, the mental hygiene movement at its current stage is already an important movement related to international goodwill and world peace. The future mental hygiene movement will focus on the relationship between personal cultivation, social stability, and world peace. The mental hygiene movement has embarked on a broad road!</p>

<h3>Rhetoric and Realism</h3>
<p>— Jinjin</p>
<p>Those who emphasize rhetoric in writing often labor meticulously over each word and phrase. Translators share this sentiment. If the wording is inappropriate, it's like scratching an itch through a boot, causing the translator to feel an unbearable frustration. Once, I encountered the sentence "I bad done a good and noble deed." Initially, I translated it as "我已經做了一件高貴的好事 (I have already done a noble good deed)," but I felt the tone was forced. Later, I revised it to "我已經做了一件動機純正的好事 (I have already done a good deed with pure motives)," which flowed better but still didn't feel right. I had no choice but to wait for another day to find more appropriate words and revise it again.</p>
<p>The extreme of overemphasizing rhetoric leads to empty embellishment. Let's not even mention anything else, taking "Wen Xin Diao Long" (文心雕龍) as an example. This is a masterpiece in the history of Chinese literary criticism. Although the praises within it are sonorous, the same meaning is explained with repetitious sentences. Its merit probably lies in a sense of neat antithetical beauty. Let's take one section of "Ding Shi" (定勢) from that book:</p>
<p>"夫情致異區，文變殊術，莫不因情立體，即體成勢也。勢者乘利而爲制也，如機發矢直，澗曲湍回，自然之趣也。圓者規體，其勢也自轉；方者矩形，其勢也自安。文章體勢，如斯而已，是以模經爲式者，自入典雅之　，效騷命篇者，必歸豔逸之華，綜意淺切者，類乏蘊藉；斷辭辨約者，率乘繁縟。譬激水不漪，槁木無陰，自然之勢也。 (Different emotional states lead to different literary styles. All styles take shape based on emotion, and form develops into momentum. Momentum is the mastery of advantageous situations. It is like an arrow shot from a machine, straight and swift, or a stream winding through a valley, naturally flowing. A circle follows its form and rotates naturally; a square follows its shape and sits stable. The form and momentum of writing are simply like this. Therefore, those who model their writing after the classics enter the realm of elegance; those who emulate the "Li Sao" style must return to the splendor of extravagance. Those with shallow and concise meanings tend to lack depth; those with decisive and succinct phrasing often fall into excessive elaboration. It is like turbulent water without ripples or a withered tree without shade, a natural outcome.)"</p>
<p>In this section, phrases like "機發矢直 (an arrow shot from a machine)", "　曲湍回 (stream winding through a valley)", "圓者規體，其勢也自轉 (a circle follows its form and rotates naturally)", "方者矩形，其勢也自安 (a square follows its shape and sits stable)", and "激水不漪，槁木無陰 (turbulent water without ripples or a withered tree without shade)" express similar meanings, bordering on redundancy. Its main point is simply to explain that writing should follow the natural flow and avoid artificiality.</p>
<p>Realism, on the other hand, is the opposite of embellishment. It doesn't pursue the beauty of wording but focuses on the details of facts. I once heard a relative from the countryside tell me a true story about a woman killed for adultery, which I found quite different from those who labor over words. I will retell it here as an example of realism. If the reader finds it worth reading, it is because the relative experienced it firsthand and was able to depict it vividly.</p>
<p>It goes that four or five years ago, next door to my relative in the countryside lived a woman who had an affair with a military officer stationed there. Later, she began associating with another man. The officer heard about it and repeatedly warned her, but she ignored him. One day at noon, my relative was eating when suddenly a quarrel broke out next door. Then, they heard the woman scream "Good brother!" as the officer stabbed her throat with a sharp knife. Soon, all was silent. Moments later, the officer, covered in blood and with a murderous look on his face, rushed out of the house. The pedestrians on the street, seeing his fierce and terrifying appearance, dared not stop him. He headed straight for the bus station and reportedly fled to Hankou. He has never been caught, escaping scot-free.</p>
<p>The woman's cry of "Good brother!" and the officer's escape are not easily imagined without having witnessed them firsthand. Therefore, in my humble opinion, it is better to pay attention to accuracy than to overemphasize embellishment, and it is better to put effort into realism than to focus solely on accuracy. For narrative and expressive writing, only by depicting things realistically, revealing true emotions, and evoking resonance in the reader can one create truly first-rate writing.</p>
<h3>The Way to Make Money</h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>In 1865, a new theater opened in Chicago, USA, but business was bad, and it looked like it would have to close down.</p>
<p>But the theater owner, Mr. Crospey, was a very shrewd businessman. Seeing that things were not going well, he had a flash of inspiration and announced that the theater would be raffled off. He sold 185,000 tickets at five dollars each. When the lottery ceremony was held publicly, the whole country was shocked. Crospey remained unfazed and bought back the theater from the lucky winner for $200,000. By this time, the theater had become quite famous due to the lottery, and curious spectators flocked to it. As a result, business was booming, and Crospey made a fortune overnight, becoming a plump and wealthy man.</p>
<h3>Various Temples</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Gods without Temples - The two stone figures at the intersection of Ma Huo Road in the city were originally within the racecourse. Later, Westerners built houses and moved them as decorations. Unexpectedly, pious men and women flocked to burn incense and worship, and even erected a plaque, worshiping them as gods. However, the gods have no physical shelter, so they can be said to be gods without temples.</p>
<p>Temples with Gods - The Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road is also the Baoan Situ Temple. Every year at the beginning of the year, those in the entertainment industry often compete to burn the first incense before dawn, to pray for prosperous business. Wu Youru drew a picture to record this custom, which has a long history. There are countless temples with gods in this city, and the Rainbow Temple is one of the representatives.</p>
<p>Temples without Gods - There is a Flower God Temple on Hubei Manufacturing Bureau Road, which enshrines the Twelve Flower Gods, who are worshipped by people in the flower and tree industry. The main hall of the temple was suddenly burned down the previous year. All the so-called Twelve Flower Gods were scorched and blackened, so they were directly removed, leaving no trace. It has not been repaired to this day, and the side rooms of the temple have been converted into a school for students to study.</p>
<p>Neither Temples nor Gods - There was originally a Futian Nunnery in Nandou, which was a huge temple with flourishing incense. Unexpectedly, the abbot was suddenly moved by a lot of money and sold the temple buildings to others, sending the statues of the gods elsewhere. Thus, there was not only no temple, but also no god.</p>
<p>Old Temples and Old Gods - The Shanghai City God Temple enshrines the philosopher Qin Jingrong, starting in the 29th year of the Yuan Dynasty. However, the address was in the present-day Danjing Temple. During the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, it was moved to the city by magistrate Zhang Shouyue, who converted the Huo Guang Shrine built by Sun Hao of the Eastern Wu Dynasty during the Three Kingdoms period. The antiquity of its age is clear. Today, everyone, regardless of whether they are women or children, calls it the Old City God Temple. This is an old temple with old gods.</p>
<p>New Temples and New Gods - Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, traffic between the city and the outside world has been cut off. Those who were sheltering in foreign concessions found it very inconvenient to burn incense at the City God Temple. Therefore, speculators built a new City God Temple on Danshui Road, sculpting statues and building a temple, creating a completely new look. Thus, it was called the New City God Temple. This is a new temple with new gods.</p>
<h3>Near Sentences from Deep Clouds</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>To County Magistrate Xie Shaohui with a Brush</p>
<p>Brush formation drove weak, fond of fiddling, at that time, exerting effort, five fingers pained! Suddenly, thirty years have passed, people say my brush is thin, worthy of Zhong You or Liang Qiu Hu. When Wang was magistrate in my county, leaving me a frost brush, how could it be selfish? When the wild is clear, you will see the wild man's eulogy, someday erecting a monument, writing away your concern!</p>

Already heard of those with stern looks, worrying the courtiers, directly taking vain words as their great names!</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Hobbies</h3>
<p>— Bronze Camel</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the late President Roosevelt was a politician and strategist, but few know that he was also a great collector. Some people think that Roosevelt collected mostly stamps and naval books, but in fact, there are no fewer than twenty different kinds of things collected during his lifetime and now preserved at Hyde Park (where Roosevelt's private residence is located). From swimming boats to porcelain pigs, from ship models to miniature books, there are all kinds of things. Among them, there are 25,000 books, 6,000 maritime pamphlets, 31 kinds of periodicals, bound volumes of major newspapers, thousands of sets of carved ships, 200 ship models, eight major collections of British and American New Year's cards, original comic strips, old lithographic books, and many invitations, menus, coins, medals, and stamps.</p>
<p>Roosevelt liked to collect, but he never became obsessed. He used these things to regulate his mind and body, considering them the only way to rest after dealing with national affairs.</p>
<p>Roosevelt had a special habit when collecting stamps, that is, when he was engrossed in sorting stamps, he would puff out his cheeks, squeeze his upper and lower lips into an O shape, and whistle silently. When he casually put stamps into the stamp album, he would repeatedly puff out his cheeks and whistle repeatedly. A secretary once asked, "Mr. President, are you sure you know where these stamps are?" He said, "Of course, I have fifty years of experience!" It turned out that the meaning of puffing out his cheeks and whistling silently was: "Don't bother me, go away, the president is deep in thought."</p>
<p>On the morning of the declaration of war against Germany, he instructed his secretary to immediately move many first-edition books from the presidential palace to Hyde Park to avoid bombing. He believed that these rare books should belong to future generations. Therefore, the US government recently accepted the books and collections he donated. The government accepted the president's collections in 1939, and Roosevelt donated 16 acres of land in Hyde Park as the base for building a library. President's friends established a Roosevelt Presidential Library Association in New York, raising $370,000 in less than six months, which was enough to build the library. In September 1939, the President personally laid the cornerstone. Today, in the library, you can see a study arranged just like it was during his lifetime. In the right corner of the room is his desk, with many mementos and photos.</p>
<p>The President also had two hobbies: fishing and being able to guess the names of birds by listening to their songs. There are three things on display in the library that show he was a fisherman: an old gray jacket, a battered hat hanging in the closet, and a specimen of a valuable fish.</p>
<p>The birdsong in the valley by the Hudson River undoubtedly provided comfort and regulation for the President during the most tense times of the war. He would suddenly be in high spirits and run to Hyde Park to find the ornithologist studying in the library, inviting him to go to the forest at dawn the next day to guess the birdsong in a competition. A neighbor of Hyde Park and a group of guards patrolled around. They set off at four o'clock in the morning, and the neighbor recalled:</p>
<p>"When we arrived, it was still dark. The President sat quietly, as if listening to the performance of a grand concert. When the sky began to turn slightly fish-belly white, he said softly: Listen carefully! This first birdsong... a thrush! Then another birdsong, he pointed out the name of the bird. He continuously identified a total of thirty-three different birdsongs!"</p>
<p>Two hours later, Roosevelt again shouldered the heavy responsibility, facing the difficult situation in the midst of war.</p>
<h3>Illustrated Songs of the Western Expedition</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>Lang Shining, a Jesuit priest who served in the inner court of the late Qing Dynasty, can be called a "worldly monk" in our country's parlance. Why is he called that? Because this man had already seen through the vanity of the world, but was willing to travel across the ocean to China, the land of Marco Polo's adventures. His character was even more extraordinary: a monk who wanted to be an official, yet was also skilled in painting. He might as well try to be a classical artist. But this man didn't do that. Instead, he played with Chinese brushes, not only capturing the likenesses of subjects, but also imitating the ancients, even integrating Chinese and Western styles. He managed to make the "Perfect Old Man," Emperor Qianlong, completely convinced. Lang's paintings of the Eight Steeds had long been famous far and wide, and his meticulously crafted "Qianlong's Western Conquests," which took six years to complete, was an unprecedented masterpiece.</p>
<p>The "Western Conquests" consists of sixteen pages, each with an inscription by Qianlong, and became a treasure of the Qing Dynasty. This was copperplate engraved, and it seemed that imperial copies were printed and bestowed upon meritorious officials and generals, so many were circulated. It was no longer a rare treasure in the world. In the summer of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), I saw several pages in Shenyang. At that time, the asking price was 1.3 million yuan in legal tender, which shocked me. I could only sigh helplessly. Later, I obtained a complete set of photos of the "Illustrated Songs," mounted in yellow silk, with the eight characters "欽定御題，西被流沙，無思不服 (Imperially Inscribed by Kangde, the Western Sands Covered, All Submitted without Thought)" in front, exuding a majestic royal air. But where the original is, is unknown, and it is even more difficult to inquire about today.</p>
<p>The landscapes depicted in the pictures are all Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) scenery, even though it depicts the northern deserts. But the attire of the early Qing Dynasty is meticulously portrayed, sparing no expense in ink and brushstrokes. Looking at the pictures of surrendering and successive victories, the scene of "All Submitted without Thought" and collapsing at the mere sight of the army is truly enough for Qianlong to squander national funds and conceal the reality from the world with his love of grandeur and love of accomplishment. In the picture of the banquet at the Three Seas, the queue of people with queues prostrate themselves. Qianlong sits on the imperial carriage, surrounded by guards and musicians. It is unimaginable that Emperor Gao of Han, singing loudly about the Great Wind, could be surpassed. In the surrender at the Meridian Gate, from a high vantage point, the small clowns are afraid. As for the pictures of horses circling, bows bending, and flags falling, those who stand in the way are pushed aside, and those who receive the attack die. Compared with today's mechanized troops, they are much more inferior. It is a pity that after Jiaqing, the Emperors enjoyed wealth and ease, and the heroic spirit of the founding of the dynasty was like another world. Puyi abdicated the throne at a young age. If he could have been content and kept to himself, he would not have lost his status of being wise and protecting himself. But he was held hostage by the enemy and performed a puppet comedy, eventually being interrogated in Tokyo, begging for mercy with a wagging tail. If the Three Tombs of the Northeast knew, wouldn't they be heartbroken!</p>
<p>While admiring the "Illustrated Songs of the Western Expedition," I have a feeling of sighing again and again, but I don't know if Puyi will transform again someday, suddenly turning red in the face, leaving the world with a fourth sigh.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>After the popularity of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull," Churchill's "The Second World War Memoirs" has also begun to be revealed. These historical memoirs of two great figures are sufficient to be the summation of modern history. Because they were the authorities at the time, and their books are detailed and realistic, everything is clear with one book in hand.</p>
<p>We recall that in the two years before and at the beginning of the war, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's "Appeasing Policy" (or translated as "Appeasement Policy," which is too high-sounding. How can a policy of unreservedly yielding and being obsequious be called "appeasement"? It is better to use the word "perfunctory.") only increased the arrogance of Hitler's demonic flames, until he swept across Europe. Chamberlain resigned in shame, and Churchill took over as Prime Minister, confronting Hitler in a standoff for five years, through countless twists and turns, finally defeating Hitler. For England, it was a miracle of resurrection, and he retired after achieving success, doing nothing, like Song Mengqi living alone outside his meritorious service, and Feng Yi of the Han Dynasty retreating under the big tree, not competing with others. His style is unparalleled. When he stepped down victorious, it was already reported that he was engaged in writing, recounting his experiences. Now it has been written, and it is undoubtedly a "biography" along with Hull's memoirs.</p>
<p>Recalling the war, in addition to artillery fire, airplanes, and bombs, there was also the battle of pens and tongues, and propaganda. Hitler's demonic face had a distorted tuft of hair, and sinister, firey eyes that were unapproachable. Old Churchill, on the other hand, had a cigar in his mouth, a smile on his face, slanted eyes, and a leisurely pace, forever with that unhurried appearance, with the demeanor of using cold to restrain dryness, and waiting for work at leisure.</p>
<p>Churchill's virtue is that he does not shy away from his defeats, but only reports to his people in a truthful way on the gradual reduction of losses and the turning point from defeat to victory, so as to strengthen their confidence in the final victory. His broadcast in London on April 27, 1941, after the retreat of the Greek expeditionary force and setbacks in North Africa, did not deny it. Hitler gave a speech in his Berlin Congress on May 4 as a response to Churchill, besides cursing and scolding, also denounced him as a liar, saying that Churchill was able to distort the two battles of Norway and Dunkirk as British victories to deceive the world. At that time, we also felt that it was not very reasonable for Britain to exaggerate its retreats. Until the last two years, we learned that the safe withdrawal of troops from Dunkirk and the defense of the homeland by the British were indeed an indication of counter-offensive capabilities, and that the US government's praise for the withdrawal of US troops from Guam and the Philippines after the outbreak of the Pacific War also had strategic reasons. The so-called "being able to lose" is the prerequisite for being able to win. As for Japan and Germany, a mass of fire, were just like the overlord Xiang Yu, "seventy-two battles, undefeated in every battle, suddenly hearing the songs of Chu, suffered a crushing defeat." Xiang Yu was also a monster who could only go with the wind and could not withstand defeat.</p>
