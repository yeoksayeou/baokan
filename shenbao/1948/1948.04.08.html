<h3>國大紀程　「窒息性的疲勞」</h3>
<p>本報特寫　（四月七日於南京）</p>
<p>七日的會，恰和六日的相反。六日是開不够，七日是恨不完。下午國大第三次會議，開了會衆拒絕延長議事時間的首次紀錄，在六時，會塲中撤退得已不到一千三百人時，回答主席張鈁「可否延長廿分鐘的詢問」的，是一連聲「散會散會」，於是秘書長洪闌友和張主席順應羣情，宣布散會，但在會後幾項報吿中包括一個建議，說明了這個道理。</p>
<p>有一位代表提出說：通風設備不好，會塲裏空氣太壞，太少，秘書處一定要想辦法改良，使空氣加多。很多人在笑「空氣加多」，這只是疲勞的笑，會塲裏空氣實在相當惡濁，那麽多的人，加上越疲勞，越不管牆上「請到休息室抽烟」的標語，會塲慶的確使人感到窒息，而尤其是會議議程的阻滯迂緩，除了少數各說自話的愛發言的代表外，多數人都在心理上略存扞格，益覺窒息的疲勞難過。</p>
<p>谷正綱是七日上午第二次會議的主席，嗓音淸晰洪亮，處事乾凈利落，從九時一刻至十二時一刻三個小時內，使五十幾個提意見者都滿足了發表慾，十三章六十六條的議事規則，也總算被全部批評過，祗待秘書處把意見整理歸納，再經主席團審議，便好提出下次會議，使議則逐條表決修正，獲得通過。</p>
<p>等一會，谷主席沒看到立起來要發言的盲代表，正待把各種意見進行表決時，又被凌鐵庵摸索着立在發言台，責備了一番，江蘇代表袁希洛打一口寳山上話，又大論提案範圍，直到他聲嘶力竭，涕淚漣漣，主席團聲大作，方纔罪休。谷主席一聲吼，「請大家肅靜」，接着才進行表決，通過代表何佛情的「俟議則通過後再定提案收受截止日期」的意見。</p>
<p>繼續對議則作槪括的討論，先把六日賸下來未宣讀的書面意見宣讀下去，雜着一些人的口頭發言意見，仍集中在對草案十七條提案範圍的抨擊。安徽代表朱道寶說：「限制人民說話，就是不民主，國家都要亡了，還不讓大家說話嗎？有關國計民生的，都得在這兒討論，要是人民疾苦不除，總統。副總統選出來有甚麼用」，一時雪片似的發言草紛紛登台，對十七條主張删去和修改的，勢均力敵。民社黨的浙江代表錢天任也大喊！「第十七條要完全剷除」，直到休息過後，江蘇代表袁行潔，在會衆不耐煩再多聽重複言論而鼓噪哄亂下，憤然離席。十一時半谷主席毅然宣吿停止對第四章意見發言，以後數章小有議論，除了谷主席開了一次「第八章的代表請發言」的趣事，和一位四川代表爲反對懲戒，認爲「是不是可以打手心打屁股簡直是侮辱」以外，上午的會議圓滿結束。</p>
<p>第三次會議在下午三時半開始時，秘書處關於各代表對議則發表的多種意見的整理工作仍未完畢，經主席團決定變更議程，等八日四次會印附議事日程中再討論。三次會要先討論代表資格審委會，紀律委會和提案審委會的組織規程。好好先生的主席張鈁在徵詢會衆意見前，先請潘公展代表主席團說明審査代表資格審委會的意見，因爲這是各國議會通例，且根據國大組織法應有的設置，審査資格是法律手續，而不是一代表可否定另一代表資格，所以主席團將它通過，但是否設立，仍將由大會公決。六日討論議則時，就反對成立審委會的江西代表詹絜吾，又開始反對，一時議論紛紛，都說報到時已審査過了，爲何又找麻煩，組織法的規定不合理，要送回去修改，雖然有代表提出倘立法院嚴守法例拒絕修正，豈不丟臉。</p>
<p>老法學家湖北代表張知本站出爲大家上了一堂法律課，他說：「設立資格審査委員會，是各國議會組織通例，審査不過是手續問題，要知道本會是國家最高機關，由自己來驗明自己的身分，是證明選舉事務所和國大籌委會等事務機關辦事沒錯，是必須完備的法律秩序」。谷正綱再代表主席團說明，審委會決定的事項，仍須大會通過才能成立，並且勸吿代表「人民的國大要創造守法作風，立法院修改組織法，是可一而不可再的」，好不容易說服了大多數誤解的人，表決時以一三五九票的大多數贊成，通過資格審委會仍須設立，組織規程也就獲得通過，紀律委會稍有修正，便也通過，但緊接着便遇到提案審委會的人數，人選和組織三道鐵閘，又阻積起來，散會時間到了，窒息性的疲勞，使議程就此擱在這裏。</p>

<h3>社論　總統的競選與謙讓</h3>
<p>行憲的第一届國民大會已在首都開會，依照大會進行的程序，即將選舉總統及副總統；一俟新總統選出之後，也就召集立法院舉行第一次會議，並將提出行政院長的人選，徵求立法院的同意，立法院如無問題，則新任行政院長即可組織完全民選的新政府，將使中國的政治面目一新，從此以後，不論是中央和地方的行政制度，或是內政上和外交上的任何決策，均將遵照憲法的規定實施。所以這次國民大會的選舉總統，實爲我國政治跨上民主憲政的第一步；同時又因爲今日中國的實際情形，與世界各國的政情完全不同，旣不像英美有兩個勢均力敵的政然，又不像蘇聯只有一個專政的政黨。中國國民黨雖已結束訓政實施民主憲政，對於「還政於民」具有絕大決心；但是在行憲的第一届國民大會之中，仍佔有絕對多數的議席，非其他任何政黨所能及，是以中國國民黨是否向國民大會提出總統候選人？如果要提名，又將決定誰做總統候選人？這一連串的問題，不特爲全國人民所注意，而且也爲世界各國听重視。</p>
<p>但當國民黨中央執行委會於四日在京舉行臨時全體會議討論這個問題的時候，國民黨總裁蔣主席突然在會議席上宣佈他不願爲總統候選人，並主張國民黨應支持黨外人士爲總統候選人，這一個突然而來的表示，不啻晴天霹靂，使當時與會的中委們無不受其激動，看看蔣主席謙讓的風度，誠懇而堅決，似已經長時間的考慮而決定的；再想想常前國家的困苦艱難，眞的一時不知何去何從，祗得決議將此一問題，交中常會研究，再向六日的臨時全會提出報吿，作最後的決定。經過多方面的考慮與討論，六日的臨時全會終於通過了三項議：（一）接受中常會的硏究報吿（仍請總裁爲第一届總統候選人）；（二）遵照總裁指示，本届總統副總統之選舉，本黨不決定　　人，本黨同志在國民大會中得依法聯署提名參加競選；（三）上届總統副總統之選舉，本黨應於三個月以前召開全代大會，決定本黨候選人，　　　全黨同志一致遵照。</p>
<p>從這三項決議看來，可知國民黨對於選舉，並未放棄政黨提名候選人的辦法，本届總統副總統的選舉，一則因時間匆促未能在國民大會前召開全國代表大會以決定候選人；另則因蔣總裁的謙讓，不願爲國民黨提名爲總統候選人，以表示其對於還政於民的決心。但至第二届總統選舉，國民黨仍將提名候選人。這三種決議，不論在理論上事實上，我們終認爲是民主的。進步的。開明的，必能獲得黨內外的擁護。</p>
<p>但是我們要指出：蔣主席不願祖任國民黨的總統候選人，並非蔣主席不願爲總統候選人之謂。依照總統選舉法的規定，總統候選人，除了政黨提名而外，還可由國大代表聯署提名。當蔣主席不願爲國民黨總統候選人的消息傳出之後，全國的上下無不爲之震驚，紛紛通電表示擁護；就是靑年黨，民肚黨和無黨派的國大代表，也已相繼表示：第一任總統非蔣主席担任不可；而且國大代表聯署蔣主席爲總統候選人的運動，經國大代表胡適博士發起之後，已在進行之中，簽得法定人數，可以說是絕無問題的，但我們仍願在此一述我們對於此一問題的看法，以减輕國人焦慮的心情。</p>
<p>第一，以當前國事的艱難而論，在事實上非由蔣主席出任總統，不足以克服國家的危機而奠定民主憲政的基礎。蔣主席是我國唯一的最高領袖，不但爲國內衆望所歸，而且也爲各國所景仰。我們不必歌功頌德，謂其對於國家民族有無上的貢獻；我們只要回憶一下西安事變時的情景，脫險的消息一經傳出，舉國騰歡如癡如狂，不是全國一致擁戴的領袖，怎能激起全民族狂歡的情緒？現在國家尙朱建設成功，反因共匪的叛亂搞成「萬方多難」的局面，若不由蔣主席出任艱鉅，如何能挽回這個危局呢？全國人民對於蔣公期望的殷切，可以說已到了極點。國大代表是由人民選出的民意代表，自然格外能明瞭人民的意見與願望，必能全體一致投票擁護蔣主席爲首任總統，是絕無疑問的。</p>
<p>第二，蔣主席的謙讓是眞誠的，絕非姿態的表現；而且相當的堅決；但是二十年來，我們每次恭聽蔣主席的演說，總聽到他說「身許黨國」，不容他考慮個人的得失與榮辱。再從蔣主席的生平行爲看來，他對於黨的公意與黨的紀律，素來很重視，尤其對於人民的公論，無不尊重；而今國民黨中執會旣一再懇請，而國大代表又表示全體一致擁護，可謂天與人歸；蔣主席對於他經過長時間考慮的意見，必能重加考慮，而再度表現他「舍己爲羣」的偉大的革命精神。</p>
<p>第三，競選固爲民主的方法謙讓也是民主的作風，尤其値得我們的倡導和讚美，記得羅斯福總統連任一次期滿之後，雅不欲違背國父華盛頓總統所造成的「慣例」，也會聲明不願爲民主黨的總統候選人；可是那時大戰方酣，民主黨　　戰局的危險，非由羅斯福總統三任總統，不足以打開世界的難關，仍擁護羅斯福總統爲總統候選人。羅斯福雖一再婉辭，雖不曾向選民發表競選演說，但全國投票的結果，他居然當選了第三任總統，便不得不勉爲其難出任艱鉅，成爲美國政治史上的佳話，我們相信，凡是偉大的政治家都抱有這種風度與精神。</p>
<p>要之，我們欽佩蔣主席的謙讓風度，並贊成國民黨臨時全會的決議，但我們認爲蔣主席可以不競選，但不能再謙讓，應該接受國大代表的公論和全國人民的公意！</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕國務部新聞處長懷特今日宣稱：國務部已飭駐華大使司徒雷登對於雷諾探測隊事件提出報吿。但雷諾此次在打消探測計劃備受各方責難後突然離華，政府是否將採取行動，余無所知。</p>

<h3>金山寺趕辦善後　住持太滄發重建宏願　火首解憲兵隊調查中</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江七日電〕今晨八時，記者再度憑弔此餘燼未熄之金山江天禪寺時，該寺住持太滄經傳問後，已飭回趕辦善後。被拘之火首管庫執事等十人，業由新河橋警所解往憲兵隊就詢，惟起火原因迄未査明。至於火熾時究竟有無和尙跳火殉寺，似爲一謎，警方曾幾度窮詰太滄，渠堅稱該寺此次所受火災損失，除庫存糧食柴油等類物資，曁藏經樓六百餘部經典及大雄寳殿等一百十七間莊嚴殿宇，均已化爲灰燼外，所有在山僧衆二百餘人，則無一死傷。警方以太滄言之鑿鑿，姑責令具結存案，以待淸除火塲後繼續調査。聞金山寺古蹟如周鼎，諸葛銅鼓，蘇東坡玉帶，文徵明手繪之金山圖手卷，均幸免於難。惜大殿堦台下千年古柏四株，經烈火炙燒後，已成焦炭，他如大殿工之如來佛曁十八尊羅漢以及觀音大士，亦均經此無情烈火一掃而化爲一堆瓦礫。住持太滄頗具復興金山禪寺宏願，聞渠俟火塲淸理後，即擬赴京向章嘉活佛及在京諸護法呼籲，請求援助，重建金山寺，並期以十年，復興金山，爲此東南惟一佛敎勝地重放光明。</p>
<h3>駐日代表團吳組長　檢討日本賠償工作</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京六日電〕我駐日代表團賠償歸還組長吳牛農，今吿記者謂：倘遠東委會對於處置日本商船目前生產品及所掠刧之貴重金屬問題仍加以拖延，則日本賠償對我國可能成爲一種累贅而非帮助，迄今賠償品僅爲日本國內工業設備，美國已有儘量保全日本工業設備之趨向。中央社前曾報道中國政府已要求日本歸還價値一億零六十六萬美元之金鉑銀及四千噸左右之銅鎳輔幣，但遠東委會對此至今猶未採取行動，我國刻亟需此等貴金屬作爲利用賠償機器成立工廠費用，我國復亟需自日本目前生產中獲得船隻及零件，以加速裝運賠償品之工作，此外我國亦需採礦機器零件。吳氏强調遠東委會必須採取積極而現實之政策，以加速賠償計劃，此舉將促使遭受戰災國家之經濟復原。</p>

<h3>武漢的周圍</h3>
<p>— 本報華中戰地記者　卜眠</p>
<p>〔本報漢口五日航訊〕武漢，這歷史上兵家必爭之地，爲平漢·奧漢兩鐵路銜接之焦點，也是長江上唯一水運之重鎭，自古迄今，它一直保持着內地第一大都市之輝煌寳座，如今在戡亂建國的過程中，自更負担着艱重的任務。</p>
<p>萬全準備屹立不動</p>
<p>去年八日，劉匪集結四個縱隊，企圖渡過黃河建立「大別山根據地」，威脅長江，黃陂一度告陷，那時，一般局外人猜測非非，以爲武漢要吃緊了，其實，軍事當局早有萬全準備，對於這些錯誤的猜測，除了置之一笑外，極沉着地給予了他們一個鐵的答覆，現在，事實已經證明了，當時所謂「武漢緊張」，不過是那些神經衰弱者失常心理的反映。直到今天，武漢依然英俊無比的屹立着。</p>
<p>零星小股不堪一擊</p>
<p>九江指揮部三個月澈底淸剿以來，大別山區劉伯承匪部統轄的一·三·五·六·七·十·十一·等七個縱隊，企圖「建立根據地」的迷夢，顯然已被粉碎，且傷亡約達三萬人左右，殘匪已全部逃竄，目前遺留該區者僅零星小股與不堪一擊之土匪。最近常局已派出者若干督導組，赴該區督導各地方行政機構，加强組織自衛武力，據各組報吿，工作進行頗爲順利，預料短期內即可悉數肅淸。</p>
<p>隨棗南北軍情分析</p>
<p>隨棗以北僅有匪兩個縱隊與一僩獨立旅，其實際兵力極端薄弱，不敢主動，僅採取竄擾方式，我軍在該區以强大兵團控制，隨時可主動作戰，殲滅其主力。隨棗以南，僅小股散匪及毫無戰鬥經驗之土共，其性質爲不斷擾亂治安，以使地方及人民無法安定，然我軍早已窺破其伎倆，現已分別搜剿，匪部聞風逃逸，但仍難逃我軍之殲滅網。</p>
<p>漢水以南地區，匪軍僅剩五六百人，當不足爲慮。襄樊老河口一帶，匪軍雖仍潛伏，然均非主力，在我軍嚴密監視下，難以行動，可能在最近完全殲滅。</p>
<p>平漢南段匪掃已窮</p>
<p>平漢綫郅州以南，沿綫各站，除新鄭至許昌段外，火車皆可暢通，匪軍已失掉了竄擾的「餘勇」。劉陳二匪，試探圍攻阜陽，經我軍痛擊後，已不支潰退，頃劉匪又在新蔡附近集結第一·二·十三個縱隊，企圖大舉蠢動，原擬策應阜陽，現事實已無法挽救，故可能轉道西犯確山一帶，回竄平漢南段，而我軍已未卜先知，自二日上午起，已主動展開攻勢，預料該區不日將有捷報傳來了。</p>
<p>軍事部署確保優勢</p>
<p>憑着周圍的優勢的軍事部署和輝煌的戰果，四月的武漢，正洋溢着密靜安謐的氣氛，聞不到火藥氣，看不到灰色，它是千百萬人民羨慕，讚嘆，振奮的「四月的武漢」。她猶如一個堅强貞靜處女，任憑那些輕佻的小伙子在她的局圖如何跳梁，誘引，或打擾，她是永遠那樣屹然地獨立不動，那樣寗靜而且安定！</p>

<h3>羅勃森闡述西德政策　最勉德人擊破鐵幕　英美決為後盾助成德統一</h3>
<p>〔路透社杜塞爾道夫七日電〕英軍政府長官羅勃森中將今日向英美合倂區各邦總理致辭，抨擊蘇聯之戰幕政策。並曰德人之首要任務，在移除降於德國的鐵幕。他說，消滅鐵幕使德國重新統一，乃德人之責任。英美已在法朗克福爲德人制定新憲章，但再建德國，祇德人能爲之。述及合併區政策時，他說，「法朗克福合倂區政府的首要目標，在恢復西德經濟使其在歐洲復興中充分担任其任務，然其最後目標在佈置使德國恢復統一的某礎。所謂統一，係眞正的統一，具有獨立民選代表性的政府。本人不能右其他建議，祗能請各位移去降於德國的銀幕，盡你們的力量除去此一鐵幕，英美將爲你們的後盾。東德不乏高談統一的政治家，然他們所談者非眞正的統一，不過與捷克及其他東歐人民結成一綫，同受束縛被剝奪思想及行動自由而已。西德人民決不受此種烟幕的欺騙，他們有自由的權利、將保持此　權利。然德國尙包括重德在內，因此每一德人的首要任務，乃爲結束分裂局面，使每一德人令體均能享受基太自由，此乃眞正統一的意義。希望德人不爲神經戰所動搖，德國的再生在你們的掌握中，充分利用這一個各邦議會。若鐵幕的這一面負起重大的責任，那一面的束縛不難及時克服。羅勃森繼述及經濟局勢，他說，「馬歇爾方案已尤給予德工業以更多的物資，西德人民經由此一方策，將步入呼吸自由空氣的國際家屬。德國的經濟本性即與此等國家之經濟有密切的聯繫。馬歇爾方案的要義，如使各需要國家本同一目標共同合作，以彌補戰後創傷。然而目前我們祇能在西歐完成我們的目標，此誠不幸之至」。</p>
<h3>英美將採取重大措施　抵抗蘇分化德國計謀</h3>
<p>〔合眾社柏林七日電〕蘇聯現採取進一步行動，以分裂德國，宣佈蘇佔區將於五六月問舉行共黨主持之公民投票，以觀民意對統一德國政府之反響。</p>
<p>〔路透社法朗克福七日電〕此間政治觀察家相們羅勃森將軍的談話，乃不久對德國未來政府將有重大決議的先聲。此項改革將包括土地及經濟的肯定分裂以及幣制改革。盟國負責官員且信此項改革，將於四月十日克萊將軍召開盟管會會議時宣布。現西方盟國已從事最後準備，以應付盟管會之分解及東德政府之成立。</p>
<h3>蒙帥自柏林返英　英蘇軍事領袖會談關防嚴密</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林七日電〕英參謀總長蒙哥馬利昨夜在此與德境蘇軍司令索柯洛夫斯基同進晚餐後，已於今日飛返倫敦。官方雖稱此次宴會使屬社交性質，但因談話內容嚴守秘密，以致引起一般揣測，認爲恐曾討論蘇聯與西方各國間關係惡化問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林六日電〕德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基，六日夜在英軍政府長官羅勃森之官邸與英帝國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥共膳。羅勃森除以主人地位陪席外，蘇軍政府副長官特拉特文亦與席。在大廈外，英兵及憲兵嚴密戒備，索柯洛夫斯基及特拉特文同乘一車抵達，蘇軍及便衣警衛乘兩車隨行保護。午刻蒙帥曾與美軍總司令克萊將軍及法軍總司令寇尼許將軍共餐。克萊事後表示此乃純粹交際應酬，並未談及柏林局勢。渠又曰是否於四月十日召開盟管會尙未決定。蒙帥專機飛抵柏林時，並無戰鬥機護航，渠於下午曾巡視柏林英軍區檢閱部隊。同時英航空大臣漢特森亦正在柏林，視察德境英空軍設備。</p>
<h3>飛機互撞事件　蘇歸咎於英</h3>
<p>將合組委員會調査</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林七日電〕蘇聯調査團今日宣稱：蘇戰鬥機與英運輸機互撞事件，起因在英機違反盟管會擬訂之飛行條例。依照規定，盟國飛機事先若未通知，不准接近他國機塲兩哩或上空二千六百呎以內。此次互撞發生於蘇機塲上空，當時蘇機在約一千四百呎處環繞飛行，即將降落，英機突自雲端出現，向機塲俯衝而下，開足馬達，擊中蘇機尾部並予損壞，結果英機亦失去控制，起火焚毀。爲求澈底明瞭詳細經過計，英蘇兩國必須合組委員會進行調査。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林七日電〕英軍當局宣稱：關於飛機互撞事件，官方在未完成調査以前，不致發表公報。蘇聯建議組織混合調査委會一節，是否僅由英蘇雙方組成，抑將包括美國在內，尙未決定。此次出事美方亦有兩人罹難，故美國可能派遣觀察員一名參加</p>
<h3>義共呼召總工會　罷工一小時　內部呈分裂之象</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬六日電〕共黨領導之總工會今夜呼召全國於木月十二日舉行總罷工一小時，抗議西西利島工會領袖被害案。據稱，該島兩年來已有勞工；領袖卅五名遇害，均係黑手黨所爲。惟總工會表決總罷工前，一內部已見分裂，六百萬會員中不屬於共黨或其他極左派者爲數甚多，天主敎徒工會領袖巴斯都即曾在總工會執委會中反對罷工，另有少數派集團亦反對罷工，並正式要求總工會重行考慮反對馬歇爾計劃。</p>
<p>〔合眾社羅馬六日電〕內政部不斷接獲各地發生暴動之報吿。加斯員利總理召集內閣於七日舉行普選前之最後一次會議，以硏究國內治安計劃。總理五日晚在波才諾民衆集會中發表演說時，身旁發生紙袋炸聲，聽衆警慌失色，但總理仍立於平台上，請聽衆平靜母慌。</p>
<h3>瑞典決保持　武裝中立</h3>
<p>〔路透社斯德哥爾摩六日電〕瑞典外長恩登今日表示：發生第三次世界大戰時瑞典當保持武裝中立，雖然渠相信三次大戰當不致發生，渠並曰，瑞典在傳統上素來反對締結同盟云。</p>
<h3>杜魯門提名霍夫曼　為採歐計劃主持人　經濟援華部分亦由其執行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕社魯門總統本日任命史蒂倍克汽車公司總經理霍夫曼執行五十三億美元之歐洲復興計劃。翟氏前隨陸軍部赴日代表團考察十日之久，今晨方返抵此間，將於等待參院正式批准其任務時，立即開始其籌備援助組織之工作。參院議長范登堡讚譽此舉爲「可靠與能幹之人選」外委會將於七日會見電夫曼，或於届時批准此項任命。翟氏新職同時亦祖任援華計劃之經濟部份。援華計劃規定美國以四億六千三百萬美元援助中國國民政府，但用於軍事用途者最多可動用其中一億二千五百萬元，而軍事部份款項則不在霍夫曼管理範圍之內。</p>
<p>霍夫曼略歷</p>
<p>〔路透路華盛頓六日電〕霍夫曼現年五十六歲，無烟酒嗜好，在國會及工商界人緣甚佳，故料參院必能迅速批准此項任命。霍夫曼乃范登堡之摯友，亦爲商長哈里曼所領導馬歇爾方案顧問委會之委員。渠乃熱心擁護資本主義及自由企業制度者，杜魯門總統不時向渠請敎對外貿易及國際復興之意見。霍夫曼原籍美國中西部，以汽車推銷員起家而成美汽車工業之鉅子，渠與工會方面感情亦殊融洽。</p>
<h3>威州共和黨推選總統候選人　史泰遜已佔優勢　麥帥得票次之杜威第三</h3>
<p>〔聯合社威斯康辛州密爾華基七日電〕本州共和黨對於候選總統提名大會共有廿七票，就今日初選形勢觀之，似將由史泰遜及麥帥兩人平分。三·一三八選區近半數初選結果業已揭曉，擁護史泰遜者最多得八三·五三五票，圾低得七五·八九五票。擁護麥帥者最多得六六·四五四票，最低得五五·一一五票。擁護杜威者最多得四二·〇一五票，最少得三九·五九四票。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕此間日本人及美國人對威斯康辛州共和黨候選總統提名大會代表選舉結果注意之程度，較對和約尤爲熱烈。擁護麥帥競選總統之軍官聞悉初步報吿，稍覺煩悶。</p>
<h3>英預算案　提出下院　豪富徵收特稅</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕財相克里浦斯今日向下院發表下一會計年度之預算，對於啤酒·威士忌·酒類·於草等項均課重稅，對全國最普遍之足球賭賽加倍抽稅。在此等較奢侈項目及娛樂方面之捐稅雖加重，在另一方面則寬放津貼制度，使全國釣五十萬名之低工資工人免繳所得稅，而年入三百五十鎊至五百鎊間中等階級之納稅亦予减低。對於國內外之豪富階級，（在英國之外國人除外）將於一九四九年一月一日起征收資本附加稅。克里浦斯釋明此非眞正意義的捐稅，乃在使豪富階級協助緊急時期之國家而已，克里浦斯向擁擠的下院詳細報吿預算計劃達二小時又十四分鐘之久，全塲寂靜而聽，僅於述及征收豪富資本附加稅時有報以惡聲者。克里浦斯之估計如果證明爲正確，則英國至本會計年度底可獲盈餘七億七千八百萬鎊。</p>
<h3>南韓發生大暴動　美當局指為共黨所唆使</h3>
<p>〔合眾社漢城七日電〕美軍事常局七日報吿：朝鮮半島南端海中濟九島上，突於夜間發生動亂。數百韓人　有執日本劍者，蠭湧進攻警局十處，計死韓人十七名，內　察六人，平民六人，暴衆二人及在天明前被槍殺之右派政治人物三人，美當局稱，暴動係共產黨所煽動者，旨在千涉聯合國所主持之五月十日大選。另訊，美方推測共黨「善意小組」已南移至該島。</p>
<h3>十年互助條約　蘇芬舉行簽字</h3>
<p>雙方相互保證領土主權獨立</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社海爾新基六日電〕蘇芬互助條約已於今日簽訂完成，內容包括下述八點：（一）芬闌如遭德國或其同盟者攻擊，將盡力保衛領土，必要時與蘇聯謀取合作。（二）兩簽字國均有決定侵略威脅是否存在之糊。（三）簽字國雙方均須爲維持和平而努力，並須符合聯合國憲章之精神。（四）簽字國不得侵略對方或加入反對對方之聯盟或集團。（五）雙方保證繼續發展經濟與文化關係。（六）雙方保證對方之領土主權與獨立，不得干涉對方之內政。（七）本條約須遵奉聯合國憲章。（八）本條約日內經海爾新基方而批准後，自該日起生效，爲期十年，於滿期一年前如不聲明失效，則本條約自動展延五年。</p>
<p>〔聯合社芬京七日電〕蘇芬兩國昨日在莫斯科簽訂十年互助條約後，蘇聯與北冰洋以迄黑海各鄰邦間之同盟環業已完成。該約現待兩國議會予以批准。觀察家咸信芬國會將於一下星期開始討論，蘇聯方面之批准則係當然之事。依照條約規定，芬蘭如被侵略，蘇聯派兵援助之前，須先徵得芬闌同意，此點實爲蘇方一大讓步，該國與羅馬尼亞或匈牙利簽訂之條約中，均無是項規定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社芬京六日電〕芬闌政界領袖今夜稱：蘇芬互助條約乃當前可能獲致的最好條件，巴錫基維總統對之表示滿意。但預料該約將使芬闌不參加馬歇爾援歐計劃。</p>
<h3>安理會通過　邀捷參加會議</h3>
<p>外蒙等人會申請重提</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖六日電〕安理會今日以九票對零票表決，正式邀請捷克政府派遣代表來此參加會議報吿該國共黨政變經過情形。蘇聯及烏克闌代表棄權。安理會並決定休會至十二日，以待捷政府提出覆文。</p>
<p>又烏克蘭今日要求安理會重新討論義·芬·保·羅·匈·阿爾巴尼亞及外蒙等國申請入會問題。觀察家認爲此係蘇聯對於西方各國三日提議重新審査義大利與外約坦入會案之答復。五大國定於明日加以討論。</p>
<h3>麥帥總部報告　日貿易出超</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕麥帥總部今日報吿稱，日本貿易現已出超。自去年九月一日對外貿易有限制的開放以來，至今年三月卅一日爲止，外商向日本訂購貨物者共三千五百六十七起，値美金四千零四十三萬元，進口貨一百五十一起，値美金三千三百零一萬三千元，因得出超七百四十萬元。出口貨中以舫織品爲大宗進口貨則以羊毛為大宗。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京七日電〕由於麥帥總部已考慮日本商人赴國外旅行之許可問題，目下日本貿易界已進行兩種組織，以便一旦宣佈許可出國時，立即可以出發。第一項組織爲視察性質，或將命令爲貿易視察團，團員約十人，將來在許可範圍內（包括亞洲各國）調査各地所需之商品種類及時尙，以便回國供製造廠商參考。第二項組織則爲推銷商品性質，可能命令爲貿易推廣團，該團將携帶各種商貨樣品，至國外各地推銷，並接受各國商人之直接訂貨。</p>
<h3>美決定扶植日本　調查團堅主減少日賠償　分散日工業計劃擬予以放棄</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕美陸次屈拉普及被任援外計劃執行人之霍夫曼，本日在此談稱，彼等最近調査日本後，認爲美國應堅決努力，以重建日本之經濟至高等生產水準。彼等相信如向日本要求更多賠償，將屬十分不智之舉。</p>
<p>屈拉普談稱，該代表團同意於史揣拉克報吿所提議，反對搬運日本除顯爲戰爭設備以外之任何更多之賠償物。屈氏幷稱，「委員會所得之結論，爲日本並無大量過剩生產力，吾人同意於史揣拉克報吿之一般結論」霍夫曼亦謂，盟國「不能在日本原料物賠償品中得到許多價値。」屈拉普繼稱，美國確已決定，放棄遠東管制會二三〇號檔案中所規定之大部份計劃該檔案規定分散日工業幷肅淸前日本財閥。調査團之結論謂，日本之糧食生產永不自給自足，唯一解決辦法即讓日本製造並輸出足够之工業製成品，以購買日本所需食物，屈氏幷稱，「此項問題之解決僅有輸出工業製成品一法。」將貨物換取購買糧食及原料之外匯，則必需尋求市塲。霍夫曼繼稱，「吾人堅決認爲美國爲世界和平計，及减低美國所擔任之救濟負擔計，必須開始投資於日本之復興。渠認爲日本應組織共計四百萬噸之商業航運，但必需較目前所有此增加許多日本爲復興經濟，正亟需商航船隻。惟此項計劃需四年至五年始可完成。</p>
<h3>國際新聞會議小組　通過我國提案　具崇高觀念之記者應予獎勵</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦六日電〕國際新聞自由會議之技術委員會，頃迪過中國所提對擁護聯合國崇高觀念之新聞記者給予獎賞之案。張彭春指出此舉，將有助於改進世界新聞。中國之建之建議並促請政府所設及其他新聞學校，應敎授：（一）新聞職業之道義及社會責任心，戒其商業化驚人化，或對異族異敎不予容忍。（二）客觀準確而詳盡之報道。新聞學校並應詳細研究其他民族之歷史及文化，以爲準確解釋國際新聞之背景。</p>
<p>〔合衆社日內瓦六日電〕美代表本日要求會議譴責政府或私人報紙之揑造及虛構新聞。該案之提出，曾獲得七國之支持，中國在內。</p>
<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（十二）緬甸作戰的不協調</p>
<p>在一九四三年五月的華盛頓會議中，我第一次獲悉史迪威將軍，英國方面和中國方面對於緬甸作戰軍略的奇怪的不協調。</p>
<p>我以在華美國空軍司令的身份從中國飛返本國，俾向聯合參謀會議提出，我可以提供的意見——就在這次會議中，史迪威曾攻擊蔣委員長，猶如我在這些回憶中已經叙述過的。</p>
<p>蔣委員長並不在塲，但是當時中國方面曾闌明立塲，對於緬甸作戰完全贊成，可是堅持一點，就是假如英方不在緬甸南部登陸，那就無法進行。英方同意假如沒有南方的登陸作戰，緬甸作戰是冒險的，但是却力說他們沒有登陸的能力。史迪咸將軍則堅持一個有限度的中美英攻勢，縱使沒有英方的登陸作戰，也得進行。</p>
<p>這些見解從沒有獲得協調，而作爲中緬印戰區盟國作戰努力主要因素的緬甸作戰，乃是一種强迫的妥協。結果，在英方對下緬甸的登陸作戰不存在的情形之下，中國的參加乃出諸脅迫。</p>
<p>一九四四年四月，在怒江攻勢剛剛一個月之前，緬甸攻勢的中國部份已經從印度方面開始，可是戰區司令部却決定一點，就是因爲蔣委員長「拒絕全力作戰之故」，四月份撥給中國機關的貨物噸位，將轉給第十四航空隊。</p>
<p>顯然的，這是迫使中國軍隊强渡怒江的最後壓力。</p>
<p>一九四三年二月，史迪威對蔣委員長施用重大壓力，主張加緊採取攻勢。可是在那時候，蘭姆加師團（在印度蘭姆加訓練的中國師團）和怒江方面部隊尙未準備就緒，而飛越駝峯的空運貨物，祗有二千噸左右來支持怒江部隊。</p>
<p>在一九四三年間，當史迪威第一次要怒江部隊作戰的時候，它們在武器甚至衣服方面的貧乏情形，是大家知道的，而在一九四四年眞正的攻勢發動之時，情形也不見得改善多少。這些人在攻勢中竟能渡過怒江和越過高黎貢山脈，對於中國普通士兵的勇敢和堅忍是一種讚美—這些穿草鞋的兵士。</p>
<p>的確蔣委員長曾經答應怒江部隊將參與上緬甸作戰，但是這個義務必須和另一個諾言聯繫在一起，那就是英方必須協同在下緬甸發動登陸攻勢。</p>
<p>蔣委員長認爲假如在緬甸南部不發動登陸作戰來破壞日軍的後方以及斷絕其交通綫，緬甸作戰對於他自已薄弱的兵力乃是一種不上算的投資。</p>
<p>對於這一點，我相信蔣委員長是有充份理由的，所以因爲他在這方面不很熱心而引起人家對他缺乏信心的指責，我永不能加以接受。在我看來，英方的放棄海上登陸作戰已可使蔣委員長不必受這種三方面的約束了。</p>
<p>在五月間舉行的華盛頓會議中，中國方面這種理論方式是很淸楚，而早在二月間即蔣主席根據當時情形而拒絕發動怒江攻勢之時，即已提出。我知道在一九四三年十一月的開羅會議中以及開羅會議以後，中國還是力持同樣的論據，雖然羅斯福，邱吉爾，蔣委員長曾就緬甸戰略獲致一種表面上的協議。</p>
<p>所以我的印象是如此：就是蔣委員長對於我認爲是健全的軍略思想從沒有動搖過，直到施用最後壓力之後，那就是說除非中國遠征軍强渡怒江，否則將斷絕一切對華供應。</p>
<p>在這裏，是値得把一九四二—三年中國方面的軍事局勢作一總結。</p>
<p>中國政府軍掌握着中國的內地，包括和緬甸接壤的西南以及華北，華中和華北相當大的地區，惟沿海和長江流域爲例外—在長江流域方面，日軍推進到漢口以上的宜昌。</p>
<p>中國的一切外來供應都被切斷，除了從印度方面由空中經由日軍所佔有的多山的緬甸北部—所謂駝峯—運來的一些供應。</p>
<p>這種局勢幾乎在一種停滯狀態中，祗受三種重要措置的影響而稍爲有一些改變：</p>
<p>（一）從緬甸撤退或者由空運到印度去的中國軍隊開始在蘭姆加受訓這些部隊會同曼里爾的突擊部隊在史迪威指揮之下於一九四三年十月經上緬甸發動攻勢。</p>
<p>（二）在中國西南部，組織了所謂Y部隊，其目的是在訓練和供應中國的遠征軍，後者是預備配合緬甸東部的攻勢以及英方在下緬甸的登陸作戰，强渡怒江向西深入緬甸的。</p>
<p>（三）一九四三年五月，在華盛頓舉行的聯合參謀會議改變了史迪威將軍的主張，給予飛越駝峯的空運工作以優先待遇，藉以在一個有限度而有效的基礎上，支持第十四航空隊。</p>
<p>中緬印戰區司令部把能力集中於實現前而兩項措置，而第三項措置則爲史迪威幾乎一直置之不顧，因此在華美國空軍人員一直在爲供應問題掙扎。</p>

<h3>銀根鬆動行局差出　物價昨全面上漲</h3>
<p>自前日外匯牌價掛高達二成半後，本市各商品價格即見　動。兼之連日國家行局日有　出，市塲銀根鬆濫，投機份子乘機活躍，昨日各業市塲已呈全面波勸。金鈔黑市猛升，商品價格供創空前高價，全市市民莫不感受極大威脅。</p>
<p>昨日本市銀根，外平內鬆。市塲利息再度下降，銀錢業票據交換中，國家行局仍有差出，數爲六四六億。就中中央銀行差進五一三億，中國銀行差出八三九億，交通銀行差出五七億，農民銀行差出二五一億，中信局差出一八九億，郵匯局着進七九億，中央合作金庫差進儿八億，本市各外商銀行於昨日之交換中，亦一反過去着進現象而為差出，練　共一九一億。</p>
<p>近日銀根奇鬆，物價自昨日起，又形暴漲。據金融界人士分析，此次銀根　鬆之原因有三：（一）自證券交易所停止遞交業務後，各銀行錢莊代辦之集團在利等均吿停止，證券市塲之一部份游資均紛紛外逃，復又潛入物資市塲，刺激物價上漲。（二）杭州及江西等地，近有巨額款項匯滬，購辦實物。此批款項，刻均存於商人之手，亦爲右力　資之一部份。（三）國民大會召開期間，政府每日所發予一切開支之通貨，數字頗大，除影響京市外，因上海地處毗鄰，物資又較京市爲多，故流滬者亦甚多。預測此種銀根呈鬆現象，須在國民大會閉幕後，始能安定云。</p>

<p>北市漲勢較南市爲烈，白粳做三百八十五萬，高二十五萬，特粳做三百九十五萬，與薄稻早稻各加二十萬，以白元加三十萬爲最鉅。二市塲到貨共計六千八百四十一石。</p>
<p>麵粉續向高峯挺進，業外游資輪入，更助長市勢，勇往直前，難期後回。晨開兵船粉做一百四十三萬五千，一路步升至一百四十七萬，而以一百四十六萬收盤，軋升五萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧漲跌互見，黃豆豆油廠爭取，漢口畫豆由二百二十萬升至二百二十五萬，軋高十五萬。本豆加五萬，菉豆與芝蔴加十萬。</p>

<h3>食糖漲風復起</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外匯旣升，而台幣亦掛高，人心看好，兼之實銷亦從而活動，價乃逐步上挺。公會劃盤，如二四粗白又升二三十萬元，四半白好貨升廿五萬元，草包升十萬元，次貨亦升數萬元。二〇中砂白升卅萬元，台赤較平，爲四百十八萬元至卅一萬元。台冰初貼一百五六十萬元，後爲卅五萬元至零五萬元。　棧單交易，初平後緊，十三期粗白爲廿二萬元至廿萬元，十四期又最高爲十九萬元，最低九萬五千元，後爲十七萬元。十五期又上落最令，初爲十五萬元，旋升至十八九萬元，中途復小至十萬元，後又步升至卅二萬元，午後更達五十萬元。週六交割爲六十三萬元。十三期四半白加廿八萬元。</p>

<p>華股昨受圈外刺激所推動，空方臨陣驚慌，漲風激烈異常。後市更俏，永紗高過漲停限度，即交股全部漲停，火爆熱烈。　晨初平和，遞交更爲寥落，未獲成交。即交永紗以一五四〇元上塲，曾小到一五二五元，繼被進至一六一〇元，遞交於此時始以同價成交，中絲火柴信誼華新次第漲停板，圈外物資見俏，港電有縮至九角半訊，檯面異常乾涸，漲到一七五〇元高價。午收爲一七四〇元及一七六〇元，較前收即交股除聯地小挫，信誼華新統益大通火柴中絲中泥漲停板，餘升半成至一成。遞交股少成交，永紗信和升一成。</p>
<p>後市遞交結束，港電慘縮，永紗上塲即吿漲停。入後滿堂掛紅，激昂異常。永紗漲到一八二〇元光景，最後爲一七九五元。與晨收相較，各上市股除暫停交易外，全部漲停。塲外各未上市股票升半成至一成，僅中興未見振作。</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>昨港匯私電報縮不少，黑市發動，人心大振。散戶之供給，粥少僧多，證券帮銀行帮俱買，怡紗晨開二〇五萬，午後迫近二四〇萬新高價結束。籌碼有限，易於躍升，結果較前收計英聯升一成，橡皮股及怡紗會德豐業廣紙版恰啤鋼業航業漲二成左右，尤以小股更見生色。</p>
<p>公債</p>

<h3>黃金市場</h3>
<p>有恢復自由交易說？</p>
<p>據金融界權威方面透露，政府對黃金及外匯之管制辦法將有所變更，黃金方面將全部開放，自由買賣。但凡經營黃金之字號，均須經金融管理局審核後發給執照，始能正式營業。倘該局發現其中有操縱市面，高抬物價事，即可吊銷其執照。對外匯之管制辦法，將改爲進出口連鎖制，但辦法並非自由連鎖制，仍爲有限制之連鎖制。當局對進口之物品種類數量，及出口之物品種類數量，均仍有規定制度，以免非必須品進口過多，危害國內工商業之基礎。此兩點政府刻在詳加計劃中云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市一部份銀行，自昨日起開辦所謂「星期存款」，利率爲二角一分，七日爲期、存額以五十萬元爲起點。據金融界人士之觀察，此項新辦法乃遞交取消後過渡時期之辦法，用以减輕多頭之困難。一俟股票價格上揚，此類辦法恐將取消。原因爲存息甚高，銀行辦理時，根本無利可圖。</p>

<h3>兵役釋疑（二）　上海市民政局第三科撰述</h3>
<p>（一）關於免役方面：及齡壯丁如身體殘廢畸形或有痼疾不堪服役，可以由其家長或本人塡具免役申請書，幷繳呈當地註册醫院或登記合格醫師的檢驗馬實證明書，向所屬保辦公處申請免役。惟此次審査是項申請書，發覺眞正殘廢畸形的很少，大多數不是痼疾，都是可以醫治的。換句話說，是經醫治後可以服役。因此多數關於以這種理由來申請的，我們多半批令「輪征調驗」，呌他們等到徵集的時候，再經一次檢驗，如眞有病，即予剔退，否則應當依法入營。至壯丁體格樣準，業經體格檢驗委員會開會時披露，現不再述。</p>
<p>（二）關於犯罪方面：凡及齡壯丁經判處七年以上有期徒刑者，禁止服兵役。若依照第二十條三款及第二十六條五款所規定，申請就應當繳驗判決書副本，或影本，作爲證明。</p>
<p>（三）關於因公出國方面：凡及齡壯丁因公出國，必須檢同出國護照，或是國民政府核准的公文作證明。</p>
<p>（四）關於學生緩役方面：凡及齡壯丁在高中以上學校肄業，應檢同學校正式證明書。有許多人中請的時候，祇繳附學校敎務處的證明書，因爲不是正式學校證明，均遭駁回，須另補正式學校證書。又高中及大學畢業學生，仍須徵集，但經軍訓及格，領有軍訓合格證明書者，認爲有備役幹部資格，可以不予徵集。本年一月間奉國防部代電規定：「高中與大學畢業生，不受一般徵集」。但是本年度實施徵集，是根據三十六年度的規定辦理，法令不能追溯旣往，所以此項規定，必須要在下一年度起施行·卅六年度高中以上學校畢業學生，如若沒有其他原因，仍然要受一般徽集。</p>

<h3>克拉維約東使記</h3>
<p>— 田春蔭</p>
<p>楊滌新譯　三十六年八月上海初版</p>
<p>本書的直譯名，應爲「帖木兒時代之自卡提斯至撒馬爾罕遊記」。原作者爲迦思迪剌（Castille—西班牙前身之一國）國入觀帖木兒的專使克拉維約（Ruy　Gonzales　Clavijo）的行記。譯者以爲「中亞史地之記載，爲數本少。東西方從事研究者，皆苦於缺乏材料，故克氏此書，謂之爲繼馬可波羅遊記而起之一重要記錄，亦無不可」。所稱屬實。馮承鈞氏所譯布哇（Bouvat，Lucien）之帖木兒帝國（L＇empire　Mongol，Paris，1927）一書中「史料」一章，亦稱及克氏「曾留下一篇頗有興趣的叙述，曾經刋布翻譯多次」。布哇之書，特有價値於十五世紀，而克氏之書，誠足資爲參考。其時中國明代出使西域者，不乏其人，馮氏嘗考使者名，見明史西域傳者，有：傳安，郭驥，陳德文，陳誠，把太，李達，白阿兒忻台，魯安，李邏，金哈藍伯，郭敬，李貴，海榮，馬全，馬雲，詹昇諸人。似僅陳誠撰有行記，陳誠屢次奉使西域。所撰之西域番國志，亦屬硏究帖木兒時代史地之可寳貴的材料。楊氏以爲克氏之書勝於陳氏者，以前者不厭繁瑣，務求詳盡，即其已身之種種遭遇，亦據實而錄。因之，使吾人可以據此書而窺見常時中亞社會的輪廓。</p>
<p>帖木兒（Timour）建國西域所拓疆土，雖不及成吉思汗帝國之大傳世之久，然已奄有中亞細亞之地，傳六代十餘主。其帝國僅在帖木兒末年同沙哈魯在位時有之沙哈魯之後，僅有割據的宗主，不復有能統治全國的君主，所以帝國的都城，有時在撒馬爾罕，有時在哈烈，然割據之人，幾盡爲　木兒的後裔，雖不復有能盛世的帝國，然不失爲帖木兒朝。抑帝國雖如帖木兒所預言，不久瓦解，終於一五〇二年消滅，然其後裔在印所建之新國，乃延續至於一八五七年。布　謂「帖木兒同他的那些嗣君之立國，雖然不能持久，可是他們的影響則反是，我們可以說亞洲同歐洲的命運有一部分是帖木兒的事業所造成。而　木兒糸的燦爛文化之影響回敎文化，衹有哈里發（回敎領袖）盛世的文化，可與之相提並倫。故帖木兒在蒙古君主中，實最屬震驚歐洲人的，其破威臨君堡蘇丹巴牙即的（Bayezid）之師，不啻茍延東羅馬帝國之殘運，比之歐洲的十字軍，無形之中，厥功尤偉。所以克氏奉命越被視爲「撒且」之土耳其勢力，以東聯帖木兒。而帖木兒於馳騁中亞，波斯，印度，高加索，美索不達米亞，小亞細亞等地之餘，還想東侵中國，時中國適爲雄才大略的明成祖在位之時，兩雄相遇的話，當對中西交通史的面目，有大改變。凡此帖木兒功文之武治，克氏之書雖無系統，但誠不厭其詳地側面寫來，不但可曉然於此中亞叱咤風雲人物的面目和心情，兼可以補苴我國西疆史的缺頁。抑克氏書記載東羅馬帝國，意大利城邦，和小亞細亞十五世紀左右史地情况，亦可爲西洋史的參考讀物，使能勾勒排比，誠多第一等的史料。</p>
<p>譯者所據，爲土耳其人O＇mer　RizaDogtul氏的土文譯本，而加轉譯。前列土文譯者所附加的提要。正文計十七章，第十二章以次四章，爲記述對撒馬兒罕與帖木兒的見聞，全書雖多俾見失實之處，可是大部可靠，在史料價値上，可稱最高。而土文譯者，亦旣據土耳其文記載，詳註各重要人名地名。楊氏復鑒於華文記載中涉及中亞史地之考證者，正復多有，因擇重要者附記於各章之後。其有關於中國之部分，羅列特多，此最有功國內讀者，惟缺少一行程圖，實稱憾事。譯筆明白，雖偶有文語差參之處，然樸質可喜，想保存原文的苦心不以辭害意的緣故。</p>
<p>中亞歷史與人物，記載本少，破壞更甚。國人於淸季，曾大有興會於研究西北地理，然成就不可謂多，蓋於此非通多國文字，先事譯述中亞，西歌各國第一等價値的著述不爲功。近時張星烺·馮承鈞·向達諸氏先此之圖，厥功稱偉，楊氏譯此，誠堪雅許，蓋有助於中外史補茸者不在少處。本文作者對於土文和克氏原著的西班牙文，毫無所知，關於譯述的本身，不敢贊一詞。但使能就其著作之重要性和價値之所在，撮要地有興會地以介紹於國人。</p>
<h3>藝術之起原</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>格羅塞（E．Grosse）著　陳易譯　大東書局印行</p>
<p>這一本世界名著在中國，已經有二個譯本，二十二年陳易譯，書名「藝術之起源」，爲大東版，二十六年蔡慕暉譯，書名「藝術的起原」，爲商務版。這二個譯本，在譯筆的流順易讀的觀點上看，陳譯較優於蔡譯，故筆者也就以陳譯的一本作一介紹。</p>
<p>從來探究藝術的起源，往往忽略了具體的事實與基本的藝術現象而沉溺於形而上學的深淵裏，賣弄一些陳腐的哲學名詞和抽象的藝術槪念，結果只是莫明其妙，決不會獲得最澈底的瞭解與新的啓示。換句話說，這是基於忽略了科學的探究的必然歸宿</p>
<p>愛倫斯脫·格羅塞博士·生於一八六二年，是德國美術史家，曾到過日本硏究古代藝術，以人類學的文化史的眼光，硏究原始的藝術，這本「藝術之起源」，是完成於一九一二年的一部大著，爲了他是運用科學的硏究手法的創始者及考核的精湛，引證的豐富與論斷的透闢，足使他的名聲永垂靑史了。</p>
<p>格羅塞在本書的自序中云：「這書是最初的嘗試——開拓從未有人着手過的境界。一這的確不是一句自詡。我們看它的內容吧。</p>
<p>第一章「藝術科學之目的」，說明藝術史，藝術哲學與藝術科學，並述及藝術科學之問題，範門與價値。</p>
<p>第二章「藝術科學之方法」提示杜波（Dubos），赫德爾（Helder），泰恩（Taine），海湼鏗（Hennepuin），居友（Guyan），以及比較人種學的方法，原始藝術形式之硏究，材料的蒐集與解釋。</p>
<p>第三章「原始民族」，說明原始民族，部落生產，文化，家族，宗敎等的情形，以及現存的概况。</p>
<p>第四章「藝術」，說明藝術活動之本質，屬於社會現象與社會機　、</p>
<p>第五章「身體裝飾」，本章爲全書最豐富的一部份，將現存的許多原始民族的種種身體裝飾，如身體塗彩，切創，黥身，耳，鼻裝飾物，髮，頭，頸，腰部，肢體的裝飾，衣服裝飾，並斷定這些裝飾的意義有三：（一）吸引異性，（二）恐嚇對方，（三）階級標誌。</p>
<p>第六章「裝飾」，蒐集原始民族間所用的工藝品，器具等物，研究其裝飾的紋樣變化與意義。</p>
<p>第七章「描寫藝術」，叙述原始人的洞窟壁畫，石壁上的彫刻，樹皮上的繪畫。並說明與原始生產等的關係，與兒童繪畫藝術的比較。</p>
<p>第八章「舞蹈」，說明原始舞蹈是操練的，模擬的，宗敎的與它的社會意義。</p>
<p>第九章「詩」，除分析原始的詩的性質是抒情的，叙事的之外，並述及原始的小說，故事，戯曲，神話等，可以說是很席泛地研究了原始民族的文學。</p>
<p>第十章「音樂」，述及原始的聲樂與器樂，並說明它與詩歌，舞蹈的關係。</p>
<p>第十一章「結論」，在本章裏，首先把已做過的硏究，並指出藝術是作爲生存競爭的手段的一種，更說明了藝術之社會的及個人的意義。</p>
<p>本書的優點，至少應該有二：</p>
<p>（一）企圖綜合藝術哲學與藝術史而建立藝術科學或藝術社會學的體系，他除從心理學的社會學的方法之外，又指示了比較人類學的方法，這是値得贊美之一</p>
<p>（二）他從最簡陋的藝術品上，發現了藝術之社會的機能爲生存競爭的手段，否認了泰恩等所論斷藝術形成之根源爲氣候，民族，環境，時代以及智力與道德風俗習慣諸因素，這是値得贊美的第二點。</p>
<p>雖然，格羅塞的研究對象衹是現存的原始民族的藝術，而不是石器時代之藝術；關於諸藝術發生的先後問題的不正確，幷忽視：「勞動，音樂與詩歌在最初是融合爲三位一體，而基本要素爲勞動，……詩歌之原始，在勞動過程之中。（見布赫爾（K．Bucher）「勞動與韻律」）的一個正確結論，以及尙有若矛盾與可以商討的地方，但畢竟還不失其獨特的價値的。</p>
<h3>文言虛字</h3>
<p>— 朱大綬</p>
<p>（呂叔湘著。開明靑年　書之一）</p>
<p>文言文中的虛字，最使學生感到頭痛，而普通的國文敎師在講解時，只是含糊地混了過去。於是虛空的用法及意義，更使學生無法明瞭了——即使學生自己去査字典，也不能得到詳細明白的解釋，如「其，指物詞，助洞。」或「與，及也，給予也。」如是之註解，何能使學生懂得呢。</p>
<p>這本「文言　字」，是以普通文言文中常用之字及常見之用法爲主。</p>
<p>全醫共十二篇，所論約二十餘字，似嫌不足，然在缺少同類書刋的現在，已可解決學生對虛字所發生的困難了。在每字的說明方面，確是十分詳盡的，每字多分成若干類，分別說明它的用法與意義。在每篇之末附有習題，可使學生有較深的記憶及自己發展的機會。</p>
<p>最後，希望著者能續編，於下次再版時插入，或另出續編，以補足之。</p>
<h3>談蘇聯文學</h3>
<p>— 維明</p>
<p>書名雖是「談蘇聯文學」，但却淸晰地反映了英國文學的精神傾向。</p>
<p>書的序頁上寫着一段介紹的文字，它說：「蘇聯文化協會文學組曾經提議：英蘇應就有關文學的問題，用書面問答的方式，互相交換意見。蘇聯作家把他們的提案送到英國之後，倫敦和英國其他都市的作家集會上，都有過廣泛的討論，在答覆這些問題之後，英國作家也向他們的蘇聯的友人提出了好些問題，這些問題，經過了蘇聯對外文化協會文學組幾次討論之後，即將答覆送到英國去。這裏發表的是蘇聯作家的答覆的大部份『</p>
<p>這本書，雖不是一種有系統的討論，但因他採取了問答的形式，所以本書涉及的範圍是很廣泛的。它從一個作家的旅行的事件，一直談到蘇聯文學的特質和精神。因此，這本小册子，確能使人對蘇聯文學留下一個極深刻的印象。現在，我將他旣　　敘述一下，</p>
<p>，是關於作品的出版問題銷數統計，作家的生活情况及其社會地位和岡書館的分布。次之是關於靑年作家的培育問題，蘇聯文學的特性，以及關於他們二國文化交流後的影響問題。最後是關於許多具體問題的解答。因爲一切都採取了比較自由的方式，所以有許多問題的提出是頗饒興趣的。就如：「偵探小說是否能在蘇聯存在？」「蘇聯有否關於誹謗的法律」等。</p>
<p>同時，也因爲這些問題的提出，一切都採取比較自由的方式，因此在問題的提法上，這書就給了我們更多的認識——認識那些英國作家的今日的精神狀態。譬如，在這裏，他們就提出了下面許多的問題：</p>
<p>一在蘇聯有沒有『純』文藝？即把作品的背景放在第一次世界大戰前面，而不涉及現代的動亂的小說？例如法國的法郞索雅，莫里雅，英國文學中的華爾德，特拉梅爾的作品？有沒有不含社會敎育意味的『爲藝術而藝術』的藝術？</p>
<p>我常常覺得古典希臘的氣質和俄羅斯的氣質之間有着一種注目的血綠關係；如猶里披底之與屠格湼夫，以及古雅典演說家之與史大林。這到底不過是偶然的呢？還是通過拜占庭（康士坦丁堡舊地）而傳下來的古典希臘的一種遺產？」</p>
<p>「你們認爲有那個現代的蘇聯作家的諷刺天才可與左琴·科匹敵的？</p>
<p>「你們認爲當代的蘇聯小說主要是關於羣衆心理的呢？還是在更着力地描寫單獨的人物？</p>
<p>「有沒有任何一個當代的蘇聯作家，他的『使命』能相當於陀思妥也夫斯基——如表現在西瑪神父和梅許金親王的兩個身上的那種『互愛』的精神？</p>
<p>而從這一切問題裏，像他們對於左琴。科的高度評價，以及那種歷史及觀點，使我們親晰地認識了今日的英國文學，是在怎麼的灰暗的處境中彷徨而且不斷的衰落下去了。</p>
<p>我非常歡喜這　問答的形式，尤其是自由地採用這種形式。所以，什麼都不加掩飾的提了出來，相互之間的坦白所造成的良好的結果，便是可以預期和猜</p>
<p>惜乎這只是問答的一部份，而且關於英國作家答覆蘇聯作家的問題的答案，未經譯出。但這些算得什麼呢？放在我們面前的是這書的有益和有趣。</p>
<h3>代數學演習指導</h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>（編譯者：薛德炯，出版處：新亞書店，定價：二元八角。）</p>
<p>本書是根據日人藤森良藏的書寫成。書前有導言，指示代數學的學習法，並具體地說明兩種學習法的優劣。這兩種方法就是系統的學習法和雜糅的學習法，而著者則主張採系統的學習法，因爲雜糅的學習法費時費力，不及系統的學習法便利。而計算的正確和迅速，則是著者以爲必須注意的事。故導言對於學習者將有很大的帮助，讀本書者不可省　。</p>
<p>全書分上下二卷；上卷分爲二編，下卷分爲五編。第一編內討論式的變形；第二編內討論方程式；第三編內討論平易的不等式；第四編內討論方程式的應用；第五編則討論級數；第是　是對數；第七編六數的計算。</p>
<p>綜觀全書，可得其優點如後：</p>
<p>一，沒有麻煩的深奧理論，單在方法上研究，這是本書的最大優點，也可說是本書和其他書籍不同之點。一般的敎科書都是理論多，而實際的問題少。所謂實際的問題，就是解答的方法，本書全是介紹許多解題的方法，不致使人學習後無從下手。本書內的許多方法，他書多未見載，好多難題，普通書上簡直沒有方法解決，而本書介紹巧妙的方法，輕而易舉的就解決了。</p>
<p>二，印　頂眞，這是本書的優點，本書是用潔白的報紙印刷，故無糢糊不淸之感，也增加了本書情彩的價值！</p>
<p>三，本書可作升　或考試的準備書，因爲本書全是解題的方法，有系統地介紹給你，使你在作題時不到徬徨無措。而且，做算學題目最感快樂的是一做便準，做錯了或沒有方法解決時最感頭痛。所以，讀了本書後，可以引起你的興趣，你可以在做題目時得到無窮樂趣。我勸每一位靑年同學都讀此書，以奠定你的算學基礎。自習者用此書更爲　宜。</p>
<h3>評「瑪婷」</h3>
<p>— 若非</p>
<p>福村野戀情的素描</p>
<p>爾　的劇本，一向讀得很少，這回偶然讀了他的早期作品「瑪婷」（林柯譯），却有了很深刻的印象。也許沒有其他的原因，就爲了作者所抒寫的是人生的眞實——不，他簡直直截地摘取了人生的片斷，深入人生的核心，剖析之餘，又使之一一重現於紙上。他描繪的是愛情，然而更多的是寫出了人間味。在小小的五個塲景中，他揭發了一個女孩的靈魂深處的秘密，加以錘鍊和磨折，全劇洋溢出慘淡的氣氛，在不得不回憶然而又不堪回首的局面下，任誰都會體味出這濃茶似的人間味的。</p>
<p>故　很簡單，直寫一個　家少女囚戀愛而受苦的小，也就是「一個微不的靈魂的簡單的經歷」。五個塲景，寫出了五種不同的環境裏的氛圍氣。</p>
<p>誠如譯者所說，「全劇從頭到尾沒有驚人之筆。然而質地的精純，章法的謹嚴，以及那種牧歌風調的秀逸與凄婉，在同時代作品中還非常罕見。」</p>
<p>沒有高潮，沒有伏筆，也沒有曲折的凄婉，也是一幅村野戀情的刻畫。任何鄉村都可能發生的故事，任何鄉村裏都可能有的人物。最眞實的開塲，最慘淡的結束。</p>
<p>使我服膺的是：拜爾納就用了寥寥幾筆，把整個人間世的戀愛味抒寫　這。</p>
<p>說的還是瑪婷。　　，一個單純的鄉村少女，有一顆樸實，良善的心。在茹連沒有到達港山村之前，瑪婷滿足於四週的一切——港山村的風物，家，和家中的人物，甚至一直向他追求着的阿弗來。但由於蘋菓樹下的邂逅，加之茹速的挑情，搖蕩了這少女的心旌，彷彿有准撥下了她眼內的重障，她更看重自己，只更看重茹連了。—她於是有她的夢境。</p>
<p>她的夢是美的，夜夜日日，她有她的幻想和想望。也許她沒有錯，一個少女不能對自己負責，要負責的應該是茹連。</p>
<p>他挑逗了她，把提了她，然而轉一個背，他就直呼她爲「野草閒花」。</p>
<p>也許，他也沒有錯，在「情感」面前，他倆都是俘虜。不說誰勝利了，訛屈服了，只要看看作者在最後一幕爲兩人暗設下的會面的一景，茹連的袁傷，瑪婷的哭泣，　　說明了一切。</p>
<p>可憐的瑪婷，可憐的茹連，再加上一個可憐的姗娜，形成了這幕愛的糾紛。幸福的還是阿弗來，他不知內情，茫茫然無所　。</p>
<p>我想起勃萊克的一首詩，想起了廚川白村的「戀愛哲學」。</p>
<p>說得現實一點，瑪婷和茹連結合，不是一對佳藕。讓茹述懷有一點浪淡蒂克的回憶是人生樂事，讓瑪婷有那麽一個永不能達到的幻想，則是人生苦事。</p>
<p>再說得現實一點，蘋菓樹下的邂逅毁了瑪婷，可是也啓示了瑪婷。本可以茫茫然度此一生的，現在却有了大痛苦——這就是悲劇，瑪婷的悲劇。</p>
<p>哲人說：「讓你對於愛的了解毀傷了你自己，而且甘願地喜樂地流血。」瑪婷啊！也許她的大痛苦中，就含有大喜樂。</p>

<h3>More Than a Thousand National Assembly Delegates Jointly Proposed Allowing Signing Delegates to Attend, To Be Submitted to the Assembly for Discussion Today; Presidential Candidate Nomination Signature Forms Distributed to All Units</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The second session of the First National Assembly convened at 9:15 AM on the 7th and passed the following resolutions: (1) To express respect to Chairman Chiang, to offer condolences to the soldiers fighting the communist rebellion, and to extend regards to people in communist-controlled areas and overseas compatriots. (2) "The deadline for submitting proposals will be determined after the rules of procedure are passed." Subsequently, the rules of procedure were discussed. The session adjourned at 12:15 PM. The third session convened at 3:30 PM and passed the organizational regulations for the Representative Qualification Review Committee and the Disciplinary Committee. The fourth session is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 8th, chaired by Wang Shijie. The fifth session will be held at 3:00 PM, chaired by Xu Chuanlin and Zhang Boling. The National Assembly Rules of Procedure and the Organizational Regulations of the Proposal Review Committee will continue to be discussed during the sessions on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the issue of signing National Assembly delegates attending the assembly, elected delegates have drafted a proposal requesting the assembly to decide to allow them to attend. Over a thousand people, including Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and He Chengjun, have already signed the proposal, which will be submitted to the assembly for discussion on the 8th. On the morning of the 7th, Yu Bin discussed the matter with delegate Sheng Zizhuang for a long time, seeking a solution. Yu also met with Chen Lifu in the afternoon, so a resolution to this issue is likely to be reached.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The dispute over the attendance of National Assembly delegates is becoming increasingly complex. The issue of signing delegates attending has not yet been resolved, and National Assembly delegates who lost the central nomination are also demanding to attend at the same time as the signing delegates. They claim that they had previously agreed with Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, and others during their withdrawal that if the signing delegates of the withdrawing friendly parties could attend the assembly, the centrally nominated delegates of the withdrawing signing delegates would also attend at the same time. Now that the signing delegates are said to be attending, the centrally nominated delegates are also demanding the fulfillment of the past agreement. They believe that the best way to resolve this matter is for the responsible authorities of the three parties, social elites, and representatives from both the nominating and signing sides to negotiate and increase the number of professional representatives, so that representatives from both sides can attend at the same time.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The presidential candidate nomination signature forms have been prepared by the National Assembly Secretariat and distribution began on the evening of the 7th, with each unit receiving one booklet to be used for signing nominations for candidates.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Zhang Boling recently stated solemnly to reporters that he has no experience or interest in administration, and his energy is declining, so he will not participate in the presidential or vice-presidential election.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Second Session Passes Motion to Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang, Offer Condolences to Soldiers Quelling the Rebellion, People in Communist-Controlled Areas, and Overseas Compatriots</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The second session of the First National Assembly was held at 9:15 AM on the 7th, presided over by the second group of the presidium, chaired by Gu Zhenggang, with 1,800 delegates in attendance. The session adjourned at 12:15 PM. The stage of general discussion of the "Draft Rules of Procedure for the National Assembly" was completed during the session. After being organized by the Secretariat, it will be submitted to the assembly for a vote. After the Assembly was declared open, the Secretariat first reported on (1) reading the minutes of the first session, (2) congratulatory telegrams and letters of absence, and (3) arranging the seating of the representatives in the hall. Subsequently, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou read the presidium's report on the following decisions: (1) The deadline for receiving proposals is set for 12:00 noon on the 10th of this month. (2) Representative Lin Zigui and 24 others, Representative Ding Xuanxiao and 7 others, Representative Li Zhenting and 16 others, Representative Qiao Jiacai and 2 others, and Representative Zhang Zhaolong, Representative Zhao Xuefeng, Representative Chuan Zhengbang, Representative Liu Yanqing, and Representative Zhang Luxian suggested A: Express respect to Chairman Chiang; B: Offer condolences to the soldiers fighting the communist rebellion; C: Extend regards to people in communist-controlled areas; D: Extend regards to overseas compatriots. It was decided to request the Assembly to discuss and hand it over to the Secretariat for handling. The chairman then briefly inquired whether there were any objections to this report. Wang Lunqing, Tu Shaomei, Sun Yi, Yuan Xiluo, and others spoke successively, all believing that the deadline for submitting proposals decided by the presidium was too short. On the one hand, the assembly should give representatives ample time to submit proposals to reflect public opinion, and at the same time, it was believed that the deadline for submitting proposals should not be set before the Rules of Procedure for the Assembly were passed. The chairman then put it to a vote, and the majority passed "the deadline for submitting proposals will be determined after the Rules of Procedure are passed." The deadline originally set by the presidium for noon on the 10th was rejected. At 10:00 AM, the discussion of the Rules of Procedure for the Assembly began, still adopting the method of extensive discussion by chapter, starting from Chapter Four. Ren Dade, Zhang Shude, Lin Zigui, Sun Shengwu, and others spoke in succession, many of whom still raised different opinions on the restrictions on the scope of proposals stipulated in Article 17. In particular, Zhang Shude believed that the order of the assembly should be: One, Report—Government report and reports from representatives of various units; Two, Discussion—Extensive review of the current situation and amendment of the constitution; Three, Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates should publicly express their opinions in the hall; Four, Elections. Lin Zigui believed that the agenda should be stipulated as follows: (1) Policy Report; (2) Amendment of the Constitution; (3) Discussing National Affairs; (4) Elections. Sun Shengwu proposed that a full committee should be formed to discuss various proposals, but the unanimous opinion was opposition to Article 17. At 11:35 AM, the chairman announced the end of speaking and the completion of the discussion of Chapter Four. Subsequently, Chapter Five on Provisional Motions, Chapter Six on Discussion, Chapter Seven on Voting, Chapter Eight on Reconsideration, Chapter Nine on Readings, Chapter Ten on Agenda, Chapter Eleven on Minutes, Chapter Twelve on Discipline, and Chapter Thirteen on Supplementary Provisions were discussed, taking a total of 30 minutes. Because the representatives raised fewer opinions, the discussion was completed quickly. Finally, the Secretary-General reported that the telegrams passed by the Presidium for handling had been drafted. After reading them once, the entire hall unanimously agreed to pass them and announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Two Organizational Regulations Passed at the Third Session</h3>
<p>The third session was held at 3:30 PM on the 7th, chaired by Zhang Fang, with 1,550 delegates in attendance. First, the Secretary-General reported on two decisions of the Presidium: (1) The Rules of Procedure for the Assembly will be discussed in detail and then submitted to the session on the 8th for discussion. (2) The second, third, and fourth cases of the matters for discussion today are proposed to be discussed in advance. Pan Gongzhan, representing the Presidium, explained the process of discussing the Organizational Regulations of the Representative Qualification Review Committee, roughly divided into four points: First, the Representative Qualification Review Committee is based on the provisions of the National Assembly Organization Law. Some people believe that once a representative has obtained a certificate of election, he is a legitimate representative and does not need to be reviewed again. In fact, this is not a matter of who reviews whom, but rather that the Assembly authorizes the Review Committee to review. Second, the review of the certificate of election is only a review to make it more legitimate. Third, the review does not affect the legal qualifications of the representatives. Fourth, the members of the Review Committee are decided by the Presidium to be senior representatives from each unit. If the senior representative has already served on the Presidium, then the next senior representative will serve. After Pan's explanation, the representatives launched a heated debate on the principles of establishment, and the articles of the organizational regulations were passed one by one after a vote. Subsequently, the draft Organizational Regulations of the Disciplinary Committee were passed. In the draft of nine articles of the Organizational Regulations of the Proposal Review Committee, only the second article was discussed before the adjournment was announced. When discussing the Organizational Regulations of the Representative Qualification Review Committee, the speakers were very enthusiastic, all expressing their opinions on whether the committee should be established. Some people believed that since the representatives had already registered and attended the meeting, they had already obtained legal qualifications and should not be reviewed again, and to whom should the review work be entrusted. Gu Zhenggang stood up to explain, encouraging the Assembly to create a spirit of abiding by the law, and said: Please ask the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organization Law, once and for all. Those who held opposing views still insisted on their views. After a vote, the principle of establishing a qualification review committee was passed by a majority. After discussing the organizational regulations article by article, they were passed smoothly. Next, the Organizational Regulations of the Disciplinary Committee were discussed. In the full case of the regulations, there were few speakers, only the fifth article, which stipulated the method of punishment, was considered too strict. After several representatives expressed their opinions, they were put to a vote. Pan Gongzhan's proposed opinion was to change the method of punishment to (1) verbal apology, (2) written apology, which was passed, and the rest were passed without objection. Finally, the Organizational Regulations of the Proposal Review Committee were discussed. The representatives raised objections to the number of members and the sub-group portion stipulated in the regulations. Due to the late hour, it was left for discussion on the 8th, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

The original proposal put forward three points: (1) It is clearly ordered that the Bandit Suppression Headquarters be the highest governing institution of military and political affairs in North China. (2) The jurisdiction of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters should include Peiping and Tianjin (the original jurisdiction was Hebei, Chahar, Rehe, Shanxi, and Suiyuan). (3) Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi is responsible for training 30 divisions of new troops, actively equipping them, and completing the task within six months.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Chronicle: "Suffocating Fatigue"</h3>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper (Nanjing, April 7th)</p>
<p>The meeting on the 7th was the opposite of the one on the 6th. The 6th was not long enough, while the 7th felt endless. The third meeting of the National Assembly in the afternoon set a new record as the assembly rejected extending the session. By 6 PM, when the number of attendees in the hall had dwindled to less than 1,300, the response to Chairman Zhang Fang's question, "Can we extend for 20 minutes?" was a chorus of "Adjourn! Adjourn!" Secretary-General Hong Lanyou and Chairman Zhang, yielding to public sentiment, announced the adjournment. However, several reports after the meeting, including one suggestion, explained the reason for this.</p>
<p>One delegate pointed out that the ventilation was poor, and the air in the hall was terrible and insufficient. The secretariat must find a way to improve it and increase the air supply. Many people laughed at "increasing the air supply," but it was just a laugh born of fatigue. The air in the hall was indeed quite foul. With so many people, plus the increasing fatigue, no one paid attention to the signs on the wall that said, "Please go to the lounge to smoke." The atmosphere in the hall was indeed suffocating. Moreover, the slow and circuitous progress of the meeting agenda, except for a few talkative delegates who spoke only for themselves, caused most people to feel psychologically at odds, further exacerbating the suffocating fatigue.</p>
<p>Gu Zhenggang was the chairman of the second meeting on the morning of the 7th. With a clear and loud voice and decisive handling of affairs, he managed to satisfy the speaking desires of over fifty people who offered opinions within the three hours from 9:15 AM to 12:15 PM. The thirteen chapters and sixty-six articles of the rules of procedure were finally criticized in their entirety, awaiting the secretariat to organize and summarize the opinions, and then, after review by the presidium, they could be presented at the next meeting, so that the rules could be voted on and revised article by article to be passed.</p>
<p>After a while, Chairman Gu didn't see a blind delegate standing up to speak. Just as he was about to proceed with voting on the various opinions, Ling Tie'an groped his way to the podium and criticized him for a while. Yuan Xiluo, a representative from Jiangsu, spoke in the local dialect of Baoshan and launched into a lengthy discussion of the scope of the proposals until he was hoarse and tearful. The presidium made a loud noise before the matter was settled. Chairman Gu roared, "Please be quiet, everyone!" Then he proceeded with the vote, passing Delegate He Foqing's opinion that "the deadline for receiving proposals should be determined after the rules are passed."</p>
<p>Continuing the general discussion of the rules, the written opinions that had not been read out on the 6th were read out first. Mixed with some people's oral opinions, the focus remained on criticizing Article 17 of the draft concerning the scope of proposals. Zhu Daobao, a delegate from Anhui, said, "Restricting people's speech is undemocratic. The country is about to fall, and you still won't let people speak? Matters concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood must be discussed here. If the people's suffering is not eliminated, what's the use of electing a president and vice president?" For a time, a flurry of speech drafts flooded the stage, with evenly matched forces advocating for the deletion and modification of Article 17. Qian Tianren, a Zhejiang delegate from the Democratic Socialist Party, also shouted, "Article 17 must be completely eradicated!" Until after the break, Yuan Xingjie, a delegate from Jiangsu, angrily left the meeting as the audience became impatient and noisy, no longer willing to listen to repetitive speeches. At 11:30 AM, Chairman Gu resolutely announced the cessation of speeches on Chapter 4. Subsequent chapters had little discussion, except for the amusing incident where Chairman Gu opened the floor with "Delegates of Chapter 8, please speak" and a Sichuan delegate who opposed punishment, arguing that "Is it okay to spank or slap on the butt? It's simply an insult!" The morning meeting concluded satisfactorily.</p>
<p>When the third meeting began at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, the secretariat's work on compiling the various opinions expressed by the delegates on the rules was not yet complete. The presidium decided to change the agenda and discuss it in the fourth meeting on the 8th, with the agenda attached. The third meeting was to first discuss the organizational regulations of the Delegate Qualification Review Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Proposal Review Committee. The "Mr. Nice Guy" Chairman Zhang Fang, before soliciting the opinions of the audience, first invited Delegate Pan Gongzhan to explain the opinions of the presidium on the Delegate Qualification Review Committee, because this was a common practice in parliaments of various countries and a necessary setup according to the National Assembly Organization Law. Reviewing qualifications was a legal procedure, not a matter of one delegate being able to deny another delegate's qualification. Therefore, the presidium passed it, but whether to establish it would still be decided by the assembly. Zhan Jiewu, a delegate from Jiangxi who had opposed the establishment of the review committee during the discussion of the rules on the 6th, began to oppose it again. For a time, there was much discussion, with everyone saying that it had already been reviewed during registration, so why create trouble again? The provisions of the organization law were unreasonable and should be sent back for revision. Although some delegates pointed out that it would be embarrassing if the Legislative Yuan strictly adhered to the law and refused to amend it.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiben, a veteran legal scholar and delegate from Hubei, stood up to give everyone a law lesson. He said, "Establishing a qualification review committee is a common practice in parliamentary organizations of various countries. The review is just a formality. You must know that this assembly is the highest organ of the state. Verifying one's own identity is proof that the election office and the National Assembly Preparatory Committee and other administrative organs did not make mistakes. It is a necessary legal order." Gu Zhenggang further explained on behalf of the presidium that the matters decided by the review committee must still be approved by the assembly to be established, and he advised the delegates that "the people's National Assembly must create a law-abiding style, and the Legislative Yuan's amendment to the organization law should be done only once." He finally managed to persuade most of the people who had misunderstood. During the vote, it was passed by a large majority of 1,359 votes that the Qualification Review Committee must still be established, and the organizational regulations were also passed. The Disciplinary Committee was slightly amended and also passed, but immediately encountered the three iron gates of the number of members, candidates, and organization of the Proposal Review Committee, and things got bogged down again. The adjournment time arrived, and the suffocating fatigue left the agenda stuck there.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Presidential Election and Modesty</h3>
<p>The first National Assembly convened under the Constitution is now meeting in the capital. According to the procedures of the assembly, it will soon elect the president and vice president. Once the new president is elected, the Legislative Yuan will be convened for its first meeting, and a candidate for the premier of the Executive Yuan will be nominated for the Legislative Yuan's approval. If the Legislative Yuan has no objections, the new premier can form a fully elected new government, which will give China's political landscape a new look. From then on, whether it is the administrative system at the central and local levels or any policy decisions on domestic and foreign affairs, they will all be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, this National Assembly's election of the president is truly the first step for China's politics to embark on democratic constitutionalism. At the same time, because today's actual situation in China is completely different from the political situations in other countries, it is neither like the United States and Britain, which have two equally matched political parties, nor like the Soviet Union, which has only one dictatorial party. Although the Chinese Nationalist Party has ended the period of political tutelage and implemented democratic constitutionalism, it has a great determination to "return power to the people." However, in the first National Assembly convened under the Constitution, it still occupies an absolute majority of seats, which no other political party can match. Therefore, whether the Chinese Nationalist Party will nominate a presidential candidate to the National Assembly? And if it does nominate, who will it decide to be the presidential candidate? This series of questions is not only of concern to the people of the whole country but is also valued by countries around the world.</p>
<p>However, when the Central Executive Committee of the Nationalist Party held a provisional plenary meeting in Beijing on the 4th to discuss this issue, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the party's leader, suddenly announced at the meeting that he did not want to be a presidential candidate and advocated that the Nationalist Party should support non-party members as presidential candidates. This sudden expression was like a bolt from the blue, and the Central Committee members present were all moved by it. Seeing Chairman Chiang's modest demeanor, sincere and firm, it seemed that he had considered it for a long time and made a decision. Thinking again of the current difficulties and hardships of the country, they really did not know what to do for a while and could only resolve to submit this issue to the Central Standing Committee for research and then report to the provisional plenary meeting on the 6th to make a final decision. After much consideration and discussion, the provisional plenary meeting on the 6th finally passed three resolutions: (1) Accept the research report of the Central Standing Committee (still requesting the leader to be the first presidential candidate); (2) In accordance with the leader's instructions, the party will not determine the candidates for president and vice president in this election, and party comrades in the National Assembly may jointly nominate candidates to participate in the election in accordance with the law; (3) For the election of the president and vice president in the next term, the party should convene a national congress three months in advance to determine the party's candidates, and all party comrades should unanimously abide by it.</p>
<p>From these three resolutions, it can be seen that the Nationalist Party has not abandoned the method of political parties nominating candidates for election. The reason why the candidates for president and vice president were not nominated in this election is that there was not enough time to convene a national congress before the National Assembly to decide on the candidates, and because of Chairman Chiang's modesty, he was unwilling to be nominated by the Nationalist Party as a presidential candidate, in order to show his determination to return power to the people. However, the Nationalist Party will still nominate candidates for the second presidential election. We believe that these three resolutions, whether in theory or in fact, are democratic, progressive, and enlightened, and will surely be supported by both inside and outside the party.</p>
<p>However, we want to point out that Chairman Chiang's unwillingness to serve as the Nationalist Party's presidential candidate does not mean that Chairman Chiang is unwilling to be a presidential candidate. According to the provisions of the Presidential Election Law, in addition to nomination by political parties, presidential candidates can also be nominated by joint signatures of National Assembly delegates. When the news that Chairman Chiang was unwilling to be the Nationalist Party's presidential candidate came out, the whole country was shocked and sent telegrams expressing their support. Even the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and non-partisan National Assembly delegates have successively stated that the first president must be Chairman Chiang. Moreover, the movement of National Assembly delegates jointly signing Chairman Chiang as a presidential candidate, initiated by National Assembly delegate Dr. Hu Shi, is underway, and it can be said that there is absolutely no problem in signing the required number of signatures. However, we still want to state our views on this issue in order to reduce the anxiety of the people.</p>
<p>First, considering the current difficulties of the country, in fact, only Chairman Chiang's assumption of the presidency can overcome the national crisis and lay the foundation for democratic constitutionalism. Chairman Chiang is the only supreme leader in our country, not only enjoying high prestige at home but also admired by various countries. We do not need to sing praises for his supreme contributions to the country and the nation. We only need to recall the scene during the Xi'an Incident. Once the news of his escape was released, the whole country rejoiced as if in a frenzy. How could the emotions of national rejoicing be aroused if he were not a leader unanimously supported by the whole country? Now the country has not yet been successfully built, but has been turned into a "situation of many difficulties" due to the rebellion of the Communist bandits. If Chairman Chiang does not take on this difficult task, how can this critical situation be reversed? It can be said that the expectations of the people of the whole country for Chairman Chiang have reached their peak. The National Assembly delegates are representatives of public opinion elected by the people, and they are naturally better able to understand the opinions and wishes of the people. There is no doubt that they will unanimously vote to support Chairman Chiang as the first president.</p>
<p>Second, Chairman Chiang's modesty is sincere and definitely not a show. Moreover, it is quite firm. However, for the past twenty years, every time we have listened to Chairman Chiang's speeches, we have always heard him say "devote myself to the party and the country," not allowing him to consider his personal gains and losses. Looking again at Chairman Chiang's life and behavior, he has always attached great importance to the party's public will and party discipline, and he respects the public opinion of the people. Now that the Nationalist Party Central Executive Committee has repeatedly requested him, and the National Assembly delegates have expressed unanimous support, it can be said that heaven and people are on his side. Chairman Chiang will definitely reconsider his opinions after a long period of consideration and once again show his great revolutionary spirit of "sacrificing himself for the group."</p>
<p>Third, campaigning is a democratic method, and modesty is also a democratic style, which is especially worthy of our advocacy and praise. I remember that after President Roosevelt's last term expired, he was unwilling to violate the "convention" created by the founding father President Washington and also declared that he did not want to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. However, at that time, the war was in full swing, and the Democratic Party considered that the danger of the war situation was that only President Roosevelt's third term as president could open up the world's difficulties, so they still supported President Roosevelt as the presidential candidate. Although Roosevelt repeatedly declined and never delivered a campaign speech to the voters, the result of the national vote was that he was unexpectedly elected as the third president and had to reluctantly take on this difficult task, becoming a good story in American political history. We believe that all great politicians have this kind of demeanor and spirit.</p>
<p>In short, we admire Chairman Chiang's modest demeanor and approve of the resolution of the provisional plenary meeting of the Nationalist Party, but we believe that Chairman Chiang can choose not to campaign, but he cannot be modest again. He should accept the public opinion of the National Assembly delegates and the public will of the people of the whole country!</p>

In addition to East India, the products of Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, Guizhou, and the Northeast in our country are also very famous. The National Resources Commission established an aluminum company in Kaohsiung, Taiwan Province, to refine aluminum products, and the results are satisfactory. In order to expand production, the commission had previously expressed its welcome to foreign investment.

<h3>Jinshan Temple Rushing to Handle Aftermath; Abbot Taicang Issues Grand Vow to Rebuild; Fire Starter Handed Over to Military Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th] At 8:00 AM this morning, when the reporter revisited the Jiangtian Chan Temple on Jinshan Mountain, which was still smoldering, the abbot of the temple, Taicang, had been ordered to return to handle the aftermath after being questioned. The ten people, including the fire starter and the warehouse manager, who were detained, have been handed over by the Xinheqiao police station to the military police for questioning, but the cause of the fire has not yet been determined. As for whether any monks jumped into the fire and died for the temple when the fire was raging, it seems to be a mystery. The police repeatedly questioned Taicang, who firmly stated that the temple's losses in this fire, in addition to the food, firewood, and other materials in storage, more than 600 volumes of scriptures in the Sutra Depository, and 117 solemn halls and temples such as the Great Buddha Hall, were all reduced to ashes. All of the more than 200 monks in the mountain were not injured or killed. The police, seeing that Taicang's words were conclusive, ordered him to sign a guarantee for filing and await continued investigation after the fire scene was cleared. It is reported that the ancient relics of Jinshan Temple, such as the Zhou Ding, Zhuge Copper Drum, Su Dongpo Jade Belt, and Wen Zhengming's hand-painted Jinshan Mountain scroll, were all spared. Unfortunately, the four ancient cypress trees under the steps of the Great Hall were charred after being burned by the fire. In addition, the Tathagata Buddha, the eighteen Arhats, and the Guanyin Bodhisattva in the Great Hall were all swept away by the ruthless fire and turned into a pile of rubble. Abbot Taicang is quite ambitious to revive Jinshan Chan Temple. It is reported that after the fire scene is cleared, he plans to go to Beijing to appeal to the Zhangjia Living Buddha and other Dharma protectors in Beijing, requesting assistance in rebuilding Jinshan Temple, and hopes to restore the glory of Jinshan, the only Buddhist resort in the southeast, within ten years.</p>
<h3>Wu, Leader of Resident Mission in Japan, Reviews Japanese Reparations Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Wu Niunong, the leader of the reparations and restitution group of our resident mission in Japan, told reporters today that if the Far Eastern Commission continues to delay the handling of the current production of Japanese merchant ships and the plundered precious metals, then Japanese reparations may become a burden to our country rather than a help. So far, the reparations have only been Japanese domestic industrial equipment, and the United States has a tendency to preserve Japanese industrial equipment as much as possible. Central News Agency previously reported that the Chinese government has requested Japan to return gold, platinum, silver and about 4,000 tons of copper-nickel subsidiary coins worth 106.6 million US dollars, but the Far Eastern Commission has not yet taken action on this. Our country urgently needs these precious metals as expenses for establishing factories using reparations machinery. Our country also urgently needs to obtain ships and parts from Japan's current production to accelerate the work of transporting reparations. In addition, our country also needs mining machine parts. Wu emphasized that the Far Eastern Commission must adopt a proactive and realistic policy to speed up the reparations plan, which will promote the economic recovery of countries affected by the war.</p>
<h3>Nichisho Maru Seized for Smuggling; Negotiations Underway in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 7th] The Japanese ship "Nichisho Maru," which arrived in Taiwan on March 15 to transport Taiwan sugar, is still being detained in Kaohsiung. The two batches of 7,000 tons of sugar that the ship was intended to carry have been loaded last month, but it is still unknown when they can be transported back to Japan. The reason why the ship was detained is that a large number of smuggled goods were found on board, resulting in a fine of NT$34,407,000 by our customs, which has not yet been paid. According to reporters, the US consulate here has reported the case to MacArthur Headquarters, and the special commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here has also reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing. All matters concerning the handling of the case are currently being negotiated in Tokyo. Our side stated that the fine must be paid before the ship can return to Japan. According to regulations, the sale of 25,000 tons of sugar to Japan was previously required to be transported by Chinese ships, but because it was not approved by MacArthur Headquarters, it was assumed by Japanese ships.</p>

<h3>Grain Association Representatives Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Seeking Exemption from Grain Business Tax</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Grain Association, considering that the Ministry of Finance has delegated the Grain Business Tax issue to the provincial and municipal governments for discretionary handling, has resulted in inconsistent tax exemptions across regions.

<h3>Rumor of Building a Pagoda in Changshu, Wuxi Ignorant Women are Fooled, "Filial Daughter" Buries Her Old Mother's Life with Three Bowls of Meat Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 6th] A strange rumor has recently spread in the area north of Wuxi, near the border of Changshu and Yushui counties, claiming that building a pagoda in Changshu is detrimental to the feng shui of Wuxi. Anyone over the age of fifty, belonging to the zodiac signs of Rat, Rooster, Dog, and Horse, will inevitably die. This rumor has spread throughout the villages, and ignorant people believe it to be true, seeking solutions to avert the disaster. It is said that if a child belongs to these zodiac signs, the married daughter must cook a bowl of rice and include a piece of meat for each year of age. For example, seventy pieces of meat for seventy years of age, and so on. In addition, two cattail leaf-wrapped eggs and a spinach plant must be placed in the rice and eaten behind the door in secret, without being seen by anyone. The daughter who delivers the rice must also cross three bridges to be effective. This rumor has spread widely in the northern villages, and many "believing women" have sent rice and meat to their mothers, hoping to avoid disaster. In He Xu Lane, south of Zhangjing Bridge in the county, Yan, the wife of He Changsheng, is 73 years old and has three married daughters. Her daughters successively sent meat rice to their mother over the past three days. Unexpectedly, Yan was old and weak, with poor digestion. Eating three bowls of rice and meat at once caused food stagnation and she suddenly suffered from acute gastroenteritis, resulting in death. The authorities believe that this superstitious rumor is extremely harmful and have ordered a crackdown to prevent more innocent souls from being added to the register of ghosts.</p>

<h3>The Circumstances Around Wuhan</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Central China War Correspondent Bu Mian</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou Airmail Dispatch, 5th] Wuhan, historically a strategic location contested by military strategists, is the focal point connecting the Ping-Han and Ao-Han Railways. It is also the only major port on the Yangtze River. From ancient times to the present, it has maintained its glorious position as the largest city in the interior. Today, in the process of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, it bears even heavier responsibilities.</p>
<p>Fully Prepared and Standing Firm</p>
<p>Last August, the Liu bandits gathered four columns, attempting to cross the Yellow River to establish the "Dabie Mountains base," threatening the Yangtze River. Huangpi was once lost. At that time, outsiders made various speculations, thinking that Wuhan was about to be in trouble. In fact, the military authorities were fully prepared. They calmly gave an ironclad answer to these erroneous speculations, besides laughing them off. Now, the facts have proven that the so-called "Wuhan tension" at that time was just a reflection of the abnormal psychology of those with nervous breakdowns. To this day, Wuhan still stands incomparably heroic.</p>
<p>Scattered Small Groups are No Match for Us</p>
<p>Since the Jiujiang Command thoroughly suppressed the bandits in the Dabie Mountains area for three months, Liu Bocheng's bandit troops' dream of "establishing a base," which included the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th Columns, has obviously been shattered. The number of casualties has reached about 30,000. The remaining bandits have all fled. Currently, only scattered small groups and bandits who are no match for our forces remain in the area. Recently, the Chang Bureau has dispatched several supervisory teams to the area to supervise the local administrative agencies and strengthen the organization of local defense forces. According to reports from the teams, the work is progressing smoothly, and it is expected that they will be completely eliminated in the short term.</p>
<p>Analysis of the Military Situation North and South of Suizao</p>
<p>North of Suizao, there are only two bandit columns and an independent brigade. Their actual strength is extremely weak. They dare not take the initiative and only adopt guerrilla tactics. Our army controls the area with powerful forces and can initiate operations at any time to annihilate their main force. South of Suizao, there are only small scattered bandits and inexperienced local communists, whose nature is to constantly disrupt public order so that the local area and the people cannot be stable. However, our army has long seen through their tricks and is now searching and suppressing them separately. The bandit troops flee upon hearing the news, but they still cannot escape our army's annihilation net.</p>
<p>In the area south of the Han River, the bandit army has only 500 or 600 people left, which is not a cause for concern. Although bandit troops are still lurking in the Xiangfan Laokou area, they are not the main force. Under the close surveillance of our army, it is difficult for them to act and they may be completely annihilated soon.</p>
<p>Bandit Suppression on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway is Exhausted</p>
<p>South of Zhizhou on the Pinghan Line, trains can pass smoothly through all stations along the line, except for the Xinzheng-Xuchang section. The bandit army has lost the "remaining courage" to harass the area. The Liu and Chen bandits attempted to encircle and attack Fuyang but retreated in defeat after being severely attacked by our army. Recently, the Liu bandits gathered the 1st, 2nd, and 13th Columns near Xincai, attempting to launch a large-scale foolish action, originally intending to coordinate with Fuyang. Now, the situation cannot be salvaged, so they may turn west and attack the Queshan area, fleeing back to the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. Our army, having foreseen this, has taken the initiative to launch an offensive since the morning of the 2nd. It is expected that good news will be reported from the area soon.</p>
<p>Military Deployment Ensures Advantages</p>
<p>With the advantageous military deployment around it and the glorious achievements, Wuhan in April is filled with a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. You can't smell gunpowder, and you can't see gray. It is "Wuhan in April" that is envied, praised, and inspired by millions of people. She is like a strong and chaste virgin, no matter how those frivolous young men jump, entice, or disturb her in her territory, she always stands firm and independent, so peaceful and stable!</p>

<h3>Robertson Elaborates on West German Policy; Urges Germans to Break the Iron Curtain; US and Britain Determined to Support German Unification</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Dusseldorf, 7th] British Military Governor General Robertson today addressed the Prime Ministers of the British-American merged zones, criticizing the Soviet Union's war screen policy. He said that the primary task of the Germans is to remove the iron curtain descending upon Germany. He said that the destruction of the iron curtain to reunify Germany is the responsibility of the Germans. The United Kingdom and the United States have formulated a new constitution for the Germans in Frankfurt, but only the Germans can rebuild Germany. Referring to the merged zone policy, he said, "The primary goal of the Frankfurt merged zone government is to restore the West German economy so that it can fully fulfill its mission in the European revival, but its ultimate goal is to lay a foundation for Germany to restore unity. The so-called unity is true unity, with an independent, popularly elected representative government. I cannot give other advice, but only ask you to remove the silver screen descending upon Germany, and do your best to remove this iron curtain. Britain and the United States will be your support. East Germany is not short of politicians who talk about unity, but what they are talking about is not true unity, but simply forming a line with the people of the Czech Republic and other Eastern European countries, equally bound and deprived of freedom of thought and action. The people of West Germany will never be deceived by this smokescreen; they have the right to freedom and will maintain this right. However, Germany also includes East Germany, so the primary task of every German is to end the division and enable every German to enjoy the most basic freedom; this is the meaning of true unity. I hope that the Germans will not be shaken by the war of nerves. The regeneration of Germany is in your hands. Make full use of this Council of States. If this side of the iron curtain takes on major responsibilities, the shackles on that side will not be difficult to overcome in time." Robertson continued to discuss the economic situation, saying, "The Marshall Plan has given German industry even more materials. Through this policy, the people of West Germany will step into the international family that breathes free air. The economic nature of Germany is closely linked to the economies of these countries. The essence of the Marshall Plan is to enable countries in need to work together towards the same goal to compensate for the trauma after the war. However, at present, we can only complete our goals in Western Europe, which is truly unfortunate."</p>
<h3>US and Britain to Take Major Measures to Resist Soviet Scheme to Divide Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 7th] The Soviet Union is now taking further action to split Germany, announcing that a communist-led referendum will be held in the Soviet occupation zone in May or June to gauge public opinion on a unified German government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 7th] Political observers here believe that General Robertson's speech is a precursor to a major decision on the future government of Germany soon. This reform will include the definite division of land and economy and currency reform. Allied officials also believe that this reform will be announced at the meeting of the Allied Control Council called by General Clay on April 10. Now the Western Allies have begun final preparations to cope with the dissolution of the Allied Control Council and the establishment of the East German government.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Returns to England from Berlin; British and Soviet Military Leaders Meet with Strict Security</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] British Chief of Staff Montgomery dined here with Soviet Commander Sokolovsky in Germany last night and flew back to London today. Although officials said that the banquet was of a social nature, the contents of the talks were kept strictly secret, which aroused general speculation that the worsening relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries may have been discussed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, dined with British Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery on the night of the 6th at the residence of British military governor General Robertson. In addition to Robertson presiding in his position as host, Soviet military government Deputy Chief Tratwin also attended. Outside the building, British soldiers and military police were on strict alert. Sokolovsky and Tratwin arrived in the same car, and Soviet troops and plainclothes guards protected them in two cars. At noon, Marshal Montgomery had lunch with U.S. Commander-in-Chief General Clay and French Commander-in-Chief General Koenig. Clay said afterwards that this was purely a social engagement and that the situation in Berlin was not discussed. He also said that it had not yet been decided whether to convene the Allied Control Council on April 10. When Marshal Montgomery's special plane arrived in Berlin, there was no fighter escort. He toured the British zone of Berlin in the afternoon to inspect the troops. At the same time, British Air Minister Henderson is also in Berlin, inspecting the British Air Force's facilities in Germany.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Collision Incident: Soviets Blame British</h3>
<p>Joint Committee to Investigate</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 7th] The Soviet investigation team declared today: The cause of the collision between a Soviet fighter plane and a British transport plane lies in the British plane violating the flight regulations drafted by the Allied Control Council. According to regulations, Allied aircraft are not allowed to approach within two miles or 2,600 feet above another country's airfield without prior notification. The collision occurred above the Soviet airfield. At the time, the Soviet plane was circling at an altitude of approximately 1,400 feet, preparing to land, when the British plane suddenly appeared from the clouds, dived toward the airfield, revved its engines, and struck the tail of the Soviet plane, causing damage. As a result, the British plane also lost control, caught fire, and was destroyed. In order to thoroughly understand the detailed course of events, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union must form a joint committee to conduct an investigation.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 7th] British military authorities declared: Regarding the aircraft collision incident, the official announcement will not be released until the investigation is complete. Regarding the Soviet suggestion to form a joint investigation committee, it has not yet been decided whether it will only consist of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, or whether it will include the United States. Two Americans were also killed in this incident, so the United States may send an observer to participate.</p>
<h3>Italian Communists Call on General Confederation of Labor for One-Hour Strike; Internal Division Apparent</h3>
<p>[United Press Rome, 6th] The communist-led General Confederation of Labor tonight called for a one-hour general strike across the country on April 12 to protest the murder of labor leaders in Sicily. It is reported that 35 labor leaders have been killed in the island in the past two years, all by the Mafia. However, prior to the General Confederation of Labor's vote on the general strike, an internal division was already apparent. Many of the six million members do not belong to the Communist Party or other far-left factions. Catholic labor leader Pastore opposed the strike in the Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labor, and a minority group also opposed the strike and formally demanded that the General Confederation of Labor reconsider its opposition to the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Rome, 6th] The Ministry of the Interior is constantly receiving reports of riots occurring in various places. Prime Minister Gasperi convened the Cabinet on the 7th for the last meeting before the general election to study the domestic security plan.

<h3>Truman Nominates Hoffman to Head European Recovery Program; Economic Aid to China Also to Be Handled by Him</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 6th] President Truman today appointed Paul G. Hoffman, president of Studebaker Corporation, to execute the $5.3 billion European Recovery Program. Hoffman, who had recently accompanied the War Department delegation to Japan for a ten-day inspection, only returned here this morning. While awaiting formal Senate approval of his mission, he will immediately begin the work of preparing the aid organization. Senate Speaker Vandenberg praised this as a "reliable and capable choice." The Foreign Affairs Committee will meet with Hoffman on the 7th, and may approve this appointment at that time. Hoffman's new position also includes the economic portion of the aid-to-China program. The aid-to-China program stipulates that the United States will provide $463 million in aid to the Chinese National Government, but no more than $125 million of that can be used for military purposes, and the military portion of the funds is not under Hoffman's management.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Hoffman</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 6th] Hoffman, 56, does not smoke or drink, and has good relations with members of Congress and the business community, so it is expected that the Senate will quickly approve this appointment. Hoffman is a close friend of Vandenberg and also a member of the Marshall Plan advisory committee led by Commerce Secretary Harriman. He is an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism and the free enterprise system. President Truman often consults with him on foreign trade and international recovery issues. Hoffman is originally from the Midwest and started out as a car salesman before becoming a giant in the American automobile industry. He also has very harmonious relations with labor unions.</p>

<h3>British Budget Presented to the House of Commons: Special Tax on the Wealthy</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 6th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps presented the budget for the next fiscal year to the House of Commons today. Heavy taxes were levied on beer, whiskey, liquor, and tobacco. The tax on the most popular football gambling competition in the country has doubled. While taxes on these more luxurious items and entertainment have been increased, the subsidy system has been relaxed on the other hand, allowing 500,000 low-wage workers across the country to be exempt from income tax, and reducing taxes for middle-class taxpayers with annual incomes between £350 and £500. A capital surtax will be levied on the wealthy at home and abroad (excluding foreigners in the United Kingdom) starting January 1, 1949. Cripps explained that this is not a true tax in the traditional sense, but rather a way for the wealthy to assist the country during times of emergency. Cripps reported the budget plan in detail to the crowded House of Commons for two hours and fourteen minutes. The entire chamber listened quietly, with boos only occurring when he mentioned the capital surtax on the wealthy. If Cripps's estimate proves to be correct, the United Kingdom will have a surplus of £778 million by the end of this fiscal year.</p>
<h3>Major Riot in South Korea; U.S. Authorities Blame Communists</h3>

Hundreds of Koreans, some wielding Japanese swords, swarmed to attack ten police stations. Seventeen Koreans were killed, including six policemen, six civilians, two rioters, and three right-wing political figures who were shot before dawn. U.S. authorities said that the riots were instigated by the Communist Party, with the aim of interfering with the May 10 general election organized by the United Nations. Another report said that the U.S. side speculated that a Communist "Goodwill Team" had moved south to the island.</p>
<h3>Ten-Year Mutual Assistance Treaty Signed Between Soviet Union and Finland</h3>
<p>Both Sides Mutually Guarantee Territorial Sovereignty and Independence</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Helsinki, 6th] The Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed today, including the following eight points: (1) If Finland is attacked by Germany or its allies, it will do its best to defend its territory, and cooperate with the Soviet Union if necessary. (2) Both signatory countries have the right to determine whether a threat of aggression exists. (3) Both signatory countries must strive to maintain peace and must comply with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. (4) The signatory countries shall not invade each other or join alliances or groups against the other. (5) Both sides guarantee to continue to develop economic and cultural relations. (6) Both sides guarantee each other's territorial sovereignty and independence and shall not interfere in each other's internal affairs. (7) This treaty shall comply with the United Nations Charter. (8) This treaty shall be approved by Helsinki within days and shall take effect from that date for a period of ten years. If no declaration of invalidity is made one year before the expiration date, this treaty shall be automatically extended for five years.</p>
<p>[United Press Helsinki, 7th] With the signing of the ten-year mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland in Moscow yesterday, the alliance ring between the Soviet Union and its neighbors from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea has been completed. The treaty is now awaiting approval by the parliaments of both countries. Observers believe that the Finnish parliament will begin discussions next week, while Soviet approval is a matter of course. According to the treaty, if Finland is invaded, the Soviet Union must obtain Finland's consent before sending troops to assist, which is a major concession by the Soviet side. There is no such provision in the treaties that country has signed with Romania or Hungary.</p>
<p>[United Press Helsinki, 6th] Finnish political leaders said tonight: The Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty is the best condition that can be obtained at present. President Paasikivi expressed satisfaction with it. But it is expected that the treaty will prevent Finland from participating in the Marshall Plan for European aid.</p>

The five major powers are scheduled to discuss it tomorrow.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters Reports: Japan's Trade Surplus</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 7th] MacArthur's headquarters reported today that Japan's trade is now in surplus. Since the limited opening of foreign trade on September 1st of last year, up to March 31st of this year, foreign merchants have placed a total of 3,567 orders for goods to Japan, worth US$40.043 million, and imported goods worth US$33.013 million in 151 cases, resulting in a surplus of US$7.4 million. Textiles accounted for the largest proportion of exports, while wool accounted for the largest proportion of imports.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] As MacArthur's headquarters has considered the issue of permitting Japanese businessmen to travel abroad, the Japanese trade community is now carrying out two kinds of organizations, so that it can depart immediately once permission to go abroad is announced. The first organization is of an inspection nature, and may be ordered to be a trade inspection team. The team will consist of about ten members. In the future, within the permitted scope (including various Asian countries), it will investigate the types of goods and fashions needed in various places, so as to provide a reference for domestic manufacturers when they return to the country. The second organization is of a sales promotion nature, and may be ordered to be a trade promotion team. The team will carry various samples of commercial goods, go to various places abroad to promote sales, and accept direct orders from merchants from various countries.</p>
<h3>U.S. Decides to Support Japan; Investigation Team Firmly Advocates Reducing Japanese Reparations; Plan to Disperse Japanese Industry to Be Abandoned</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 6th] U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper and Paul Hoffman, who was appointed to execute the foreign aid program, said here today that after recently investigating Japan, they believed that the United States should resolutely strive to rebuild Japan's economy to a high level of production. They believe it would be very unwise to demand more reparations from Japan.</p>
<p>Draper said that the delegation agreed with the proposal made in the Strack Report to oppose the removal of any more reparations from Japan other than those obviously for war equipment. Draper also said, "The conclusion reached by the committee is that Japan does not have a large surplus of productivity, and we agree with the general conclusion of the Strack Report." Hoffman also said that the Allied nations "cannot get much value from Japanese raw material reparations." Draper continued, saying that the United States has indeed decided to abandon most of the plans stipulated in Far East Control Council File No. 230. This file stipulates the decentralization of Japanese industry and the elimination of the former Japanese zaibatsu. The investigation team concluded that Japan's food production will never be self-sufficient, and the only solution is to allow Japan to manufacture and export enough industrial products to buy the food it needs. Draper also said, "The only solution to this problem is to export industrial products." In order to exchange goods for the foreign exchange to buy food and raw materials, it is necessary to seek markets. Hoffman continued, "We firmly believe that the United States must begin investing in the restoration of Japan for the sake of world peace and to reduce the burden of relief borne by the United States." He believes that Japan should organize a total of 4 million tons of commercial shipping, but it must increase much more than what it currently has. Japan urgently needs merchant ships to revive its economy. However, this plan will take four to five years to complete.</p>
<h3>International News Conference Subcommittee Passes Our Country's Proposal: Journalists with Lofty Ideals Should Be Rewarded</h3>
<p>[Reuters Geneva, 6th] The Technical Committee of the International Conference on Freedom of the Press recently passed China's proposal to reward journalists who uphold the lofty ideals of the United Nations. Zhang Pengchun pointed out that this move will help improve world news. China's suggestion also urged government-established and other journalism schools to teach: (1) the morality and social responsibility of the journalism profession, and to guard against commercialization, sensationalism, or intolerance of different races and religions; (2) objective, accurate, and detailed reporting. Journalism schools should also study in detail the history and culture of other nations in order to accurately interpret the background of international news.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Geneva, 6th] The U.S. representative today requested the conference to condemn the fabrication and fictionalization of news by government or private newspapers. The proposal received the support of seven countries, including China.</p>
<h3>General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyright by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance</p>
<p>Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>(12) The Uncoordinated Operations in Burma</p>
<p>At the Washington Conference in May 1943, I first learned of the strange lack of coordination between General Stilwell, the British side, and the Chinese side regarding the military strategy for the Burma campaign.</p>
<p>As commander of the U.S. Air Force in China, I flew back to the country from China to present the opinions I could provide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff—it was at this meeting that Stilwell attacked Chairman Chiang, as I have already described in these memoirs.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang was not present, but the Chinese side at that time made clear its position, fully supporting the Burma campaign, but insisting on one point, that is, if the British did not land in southern Burma, it would be impossible to carry it out. The British agreed that the Burma campaign was risky without the southern landing operation, but strongly argued that they did not have the ability to land. General Stilwell insisted on a limited Sino-American-British offensive, even without the British landing operation.</p>
<p>These views were never coordinated, and the Burma campaign, which was the main factor in the Allied war effort in the China-Burma-India theater, was a forced compromise. As a result, in the absence of a British landing operation in lower Burma, China's participation was coerced.</p>
<p>In April 1944, just one month before the Nu River offensive, the Chinese part of the Burma offensive had already begun from the Indian side, but the theater command decided that because Chairman Chiang "refused to fully fight," the tonnage of goods allocated to Chinese agencies in April would be transferred to the Fourteenth Air Force.</p>
<p>Obviously, this was the final pressure to force the Chinese army to cross the Nu River.</p>
<p>In February 1943, Stilwell put great pressure on Chairman Chiang, advocating for an intensification of the offensive. But at that time, the Ramgarh divisions (Chinese divisions trained in Ramgarh, India) and the troops on the Nu River front were not ready, and only about 2,000 tons of supplies were airlifted over the Hump to support the Nu River troops.</p>
<p>During 1943, when Stilwell first wanted the Nu River troops to fight, their lack of weapons and even clothing was well known, and the situation did not improve much when the real offensive was launched in 1944. That these people were able to cross the Nu River and cross the Gaoligong Mountains during the offensive is a tribute to the courage and perseverance of the ordinary Chinese soldiers—these soldiers wearing straw sandals.</p>
<p>Indeed, Chairman Chiang had promised that the Nu River troops would participate in the upper Burma campaign, but this obligation had to be linked to another promise, which was that the British must coordinate and launch a landing offensive in lower Burma.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang believed that if a landing operation was not launched in southern Burma to disrupt the Japanese rear and cut off their transportation lines, the Burma campaign would be an uneconomical investment for his own weak forces.</p>
<p>On this point, I believe that Chairman Chiang had sufficient reasons, so I can never accept the accusation that he lacked confidence because he was not very enthusiastic in this regard. In my opinion, the British abandonment of the maritime landing operation already allowed Chairman Chiang to avoid being subject to this three-way constraint.</p>
<p>In the Washington Conference held in May, the Chinese side's theoretical approach was very clear, and it had already been put forward as early as February when Chairman Chiang refused to launch the Nu River offensive based on the situation at that time. I know that at the Cairo Conference in November 1943 and after the Cairo Conference, China still held the same argument, even though Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chairman Chiang had reached a superficial agreement on the Burma strategy.</p>
<p>So my impression is this: that Chairman Chiang never wavered from what I considered to be sound military strategic thinking, until after the final pressure was applied, that is to say, unless the Chinese Expeditionary Force forcibly crossed the Nu River, all supplies to China would be cut off.</p>
<p>Here, it is worthwhile to summarize the military situation in China in 1942-43.</p>
<p>The Chinese government army controlled the interior of China, including the southwest bordering Burma and considerable areas of North China, Central China, and North China, with the exception of the coast and the Yangtze River basin—in the Yangtze River basin, the Japanese army advanced to Yichang above Hankou.</p>
<p>All of China's external supplies were cut off, except for some supplies that were transported from India by air over the mountainous northern Burma occupied by the Japanese army—the so-called Hump.</p>
<p>This situation was almost in a stagnant state, only slightly changed by the influence of three important measures:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese troops who withdrew from Burma or were airlifted to India began to be trained in Ramgarh. These troops, together with the commando forces in Manir, launched an offensive through upper Burma in October 1943 under Stilwell's command.</p>
<p>(2) In southwestern China, the so-called Y Force was organized, the purpose of which was to train and supply the Chinese Expeditionary Force, which was prepared to coordinate with the offensive in eastern Burma and the British landing operation in lower Burma, forcibly cross the Nu River and penetrate deep into Burma to the west.</p>
<p>(3) In May 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting held in Washington changed General Stilwell's proposal, giving priority to the airlift work over the Hump, so as to support the Fourteenth Air Force on a limited and effective basis.</p>
<p>The China-Burma-India theater command concentrated its capabilities on implementing the first two measures, while the third measure was almost always ignored by Stilwell, so the U.S. Air Force personnel in China have been struggling with supply issues.</p>

<h3>Wide Divergence in Labor-Management Opinions: No Outcome on Vehicle Rental Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw and Tricycle Rental Review Committee held its fourth meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to review new prices. Huang Changhan, Head of the Welfare Engineering Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, presided over the discussion based on the data provided by both labor and management. The data provided by the vehicle owners calculated the average cost of the vehicle body parts consumption, resulting in a new daily rental price of approximately ninety thousand yuan for rickshaws, one hundred and eighty thousand yuan for single-person tricycles, and two hundred thousand yuan for double-person tricycles. The labor side's estimate of parts consumption was approximately seventy thousand yuan for double-person tricycles, which is three times less than the figure provided by the vehicle owners. For example, the vehicle owners claimed that the chains used on the vehicle bodies could only be used for three months, while the labor side claimed that they could be used for eight months. Due to the large discrepancy, the Bureau of Social Affairs decided to investigate the average usage period and value of each part before convening another meeting to decide on the rental figures in the near future. The principle of military rental remains unchanged, with adjustments made every three months. If there are drastic price fluctuations, adjustments may be requested at any time.</p>

<h3>No Differential Allowance for Public School Fabric Rationing: Personnel Changes Must be Reported by Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The summer fabric rationing for public school employees in this city this year is being actively prepared by the China Textile Company. According to past practice, those who did not want fabric would receive a differential allowance. However, the company believes that the procedure is too cumbersome and requires the disbursement of a large amount of funds, so it has decided to handle it the same way as the capital, Tianjin, and Beiping from this summer onwards.

<h3>The Purpose of Expanding Rationing is Not to Freeze the Index</h3>
<p>Group Convener Issues Statement</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to stabilize the cost of living index, the Bureau of Social Affairs has proposed expanding the rationing of daily necessities, with various factories mutually distributing products. After exchanging opinions at the Rizhao meeting, an eleven-member group was appointed to meet next Monday to study technical issues. According to Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Division of the Bureau of Social Affairs and convener of the group, the purpose of this measure is to stabilize the index, not to freeze it. Factories will supply daily necessities to employees at cost, eliminating the profit-seeking intermediaries of wholesalers and retailers. The price of rationed goods should be at least 20% to 30% cheaper than the retail price on the market. This matter requires cooperation, with industrial raw material factories supplying raw materials to factories that manufacture daily necessities. If necessary, the government plans to allocate raw materials to the factories or provide loans to the factories in order to achieve the ideal of mutual cooperation and large-scale production and sales. The types of rationed goods and the target beneficiaries will be discussed and decided at the meeting next Monday.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Food Considers Rationing Flour to Fried Dough Sticks and Sesame Cake Businesses</h3>
<p>The fried dough stick and sesame cake merchants in this city previously elected representatives, Dai Ziquan, etc., to separately submit petitions to the City Council and the Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies, requesting the allocation of flour in order to save their businesses and benefit the livelihood of the poor. It is now known that the Bureau of Social Affairs has received a telegram from the Ministry of Food, requesting a detailed table listing the number of fried dough stick, sesame cake, specialized rice-filled bun, cut noodle shops, and Western-style snack shops in the city, as well as the average monthly flour requirement and the total requirement. The Ministry of Food is carefully studying whether to resume rationing to all flour-requiring businesses. However, the Fried Dough Stick Association previously mismanaged the rationing, resulting in members extorting additional fees for the rationed flour and fighting for leadership, attracting local gangsters and gathering crowds to fight. The Social Bureau ordered its dissolution. If flour rationing can be resumed in the future, the organization must first be reorganized before rationing can be carried out to prevent disputes.</p>

<h3>Provincial and Municipal Demarcation of Jurisdictions: Bureaus Consult to Survey Boundaries and Take Over; Zhuzhai Township Residents Make New Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The demarcation of jurisdictions between this city and Jiangsu Province has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the City Government has ordered the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Finance, and the Bureau of Land Administration to comply and report. It is now known that the Bureau of Land Administration is scheduled to convene a meeting with the eight bureaus under the City Government this afternoon to discuss procedures for surveying boundaries and taking over. Once a decision is made, the Dachang and Xinzhuang districts can be formally incorporated into this city. Furthermore, the provincial and municipal boundary of Zhuzhai Township was previously approved by the Executive Yuan to be the Panlong River, with the north bank belonging to the province and the south bank belonging to the city. After hearing the news, the residents of Zhuzhai Township recently submitted a joint petition to the Bureau of Land Administration, signed by representatives such as Zhang Ziqi, requesting that the Zhangshen Port Hongjiang be changed to the natural boundary line, incorporating the ten security units on the north bank into the urban area. The petition stated that most of the northern half of Zhuzhai was originally under the jurisdiction of the city, but now it is incorporated into Jiading County, causing greater resentment among the residents. If the province and county insist on taking over forcibly, they will resolutely resist to show their determination. Therefore, they hope that Mayor Wu can forward the petition to the Executive Yuan to argue the case based on reason, so as to prevent the situation from deteriorating. This will be discussed at the City Government's meeting to discuss the surveying of boundaries and takeover procedures today.</p>
<p>Previously Determined Measures Approved by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] According to the Ministry of Interior, the demarcation of the boundary between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality has finally been resolved.

In the southern part of Shanghai, Shanghai County is retained, and in the western part of Shanghai, the Panlong Port, Xiaolai Port, and Zhu Port are the boundaries. The eastern part of Yibao District belongs to Shanghai, and the eastern part of Xinzhuang District belongs to Jiangsu. In September last year, the Executive Yuan approved its implementation. In October, both parties met in Shanghai to discuss. For the convenience of exchange, it was proposed to exchange jurisdiction over the northern part of Dachang District in northern Shanghai and part of the eastern part of Xinzhuang District, while the rest would still follow the boundary line approved by the Executive Yuan, that is, the Yunzaobang River in northern Shanghai, the Chunshen Tang and Hengli Quejia Tang in southern Shanghai, and the original boundary in western Shanghai. Agreements have also been reached on the handling of subsidies for field taxes, public property, public funds, and local armed forces. After review by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance, they have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>Han Langan Appears in Court: Defends Himself Against Fraud Charges, Experienced Enough to Be on Camera</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of the comedian "Skinny Monkey" Han Langan, Shen Mengshi (the legal representative of Huaguang Film Production Company), and Gao Wenliang (the general manager of Huaguang Film Production Company) being sued for fraud by Guangdong film merchant Liao Zhenxing was heard in court yesterday morning. According to the plaintiff, Liao entered into a contract with Shen, investing 100 million yuan to build film production studio facilities in Huangjiatang, Xietu Road, Nanshi. Upon completion, the facilities, along with all filmmaking equipment, were to be provided to Liao for use, with the principle of producing two films every six months. Gao Wenliang acted as guarantor, and Han Langan and Fang Heming were witnesses. Liao paid out 76 million yuan successively. Shen et al. claimed that due to rising prices, the original budget was insufficient, and Hua Xianglin, a "social butterfly," and others invested to produce the film "From Military Dreams." Liao accused Shen et al. of breaching the contract and sued them in court for breach of trust and fraud. Han Langan and others stated in court yesterday that Liao's payments were not made as agreed, and they successively advanced 76 million yuan. The delay was prolonged, and prices continued to rise, so revenue could not cover expenses, and losses were incalculable. They later agreed to film one movie for Liao as compensation, but Liao was still not satisfied. They are willing to repay Liao's advances and add some interest. After questioning, they were all ordered to return and will be interrogated again at a later date. Han wore a peaked cap, a straw-yellow shirt, a yellow tie, and a tweed suit. He is already forty years old this year, but he is still lively as a teenager, with a thin face and a tuft of black hair next to his right ear. He said he is currently filming two films at Huaguang Company, one called "Black Night Murder Case" and the other called "Hero on the Sea." In addition to Han, the cast includes Guan Hongda, Mei Xi, Bai Hong, Sun Min, Zhang Zhizhi, etc. He jokingly said: "It's my first time being sued. I should film this experience."</p>

<h3>Money Supply Loosening, Banks Extending Funds, Prices Rise Across the Board Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the foreign exchange rate rose by as much as 25% the day before yesterday, prices of various commodities in the city have shown signs of movement. Coupled with the fact that national banks have been extending funds in recent days, the city's money supply is becoming loose, and speculators are taking the opportunity to become active. Yesterday, all industries showed across-the-board fluctuations. The black market for gold and banknotes soared, and commodity prices reached unprecedented highs, leaving all citizens in the city feeling extremely threatened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the city's money supply was level externally but loose internally. Interest rates in the market fell again. In the clearing of bills among banks and money shops, national banks were still extending funds, totaling 64.6 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a surplus of 51.3 billion, the Bank of China had a deficit of 83.9 billion, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 5.7 billion, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 25.1 billion, the Central Trust of China had a deficit of 18.9 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a surplus of 7.9 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a surplus of 8.8 billion. Foreign banks in the city also reversed their previous surplus phenomenon and had a deficit in yesterday's clearing, totaling 19.1 billion.</p>
<p>The recent extraordinary looseness of the money supply has caused prices to skyrocket again since yesterday. According to financial analysts, the reasons for this round of monetary easing are threefold: (1) Since the stock exchange stopped inter-day trading, the collective lending activities of the banks and money shops that acted as agents have ceased. Some of the floating capital in the stock market has fled and re-entered the commodity market, stimulating price increases. (2) Large sums of money have recently been remitted to Shanghai from Hangzhou, Jiangxi and other places to purchase physical goods. This batch of funds is currently held by merchants and is also a part of the supporting capital. (3) During the National Assembly, the government's daily expenditures are substantial. This affects the capital market and, because Shanghai is adjacent and has more material goods than the capital, much flows into Shanghai. It is predicted that this phenomenon of monetary easing will not stabilize until after the National Assembly concludes.</p>
<h3>Extra-Market Funds Infiltrate: Food Prices Hit New Highs, Flour, Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The rise in rice prices is expanding. The People's Food Allocation Association wants to purchase rice in the market, causing renewed turmoil in the rice market, which had just stabilized. Although the market was under strict surveillance by economic police yesterday, it was not enough to curb the price surge. Cargo owners heard that the price of Xidi rice products continued to rise, and they repeatedly raised prices taking advantage of the residual effects of the previous market increase.</p>
<p>The Nanshi rice market opened sharply higher by 200,000 in the morning. The increased price wasn't sustained, with a slight drop of 50,000, finally settling at a rise of 150,000. White japonica rice traded at 3.75 million, with thin indica rice and early indica rice each rising by 150,000, and shaded white yuan (a type of rice) rising by 100,000.</p>

White japonica rice traded at 3.85 million, up 250,000, special japonica rice traded at 3.95 million, and thin indica rice and early indica rice each increased by 200,000, with shaded white yuan seeing the largest increase of 300,000. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 6,841 shi (a unit of dry measure).</p>
<p>Wheat flour continued to advance toward new peaks. The influx of extra-market funds further fueled the market, pushing it forward relentlessly, with little prospect of a pullback. Morning opening price for Bingchuan Flour was 1.435 million, rising all the way to 1.47 million, closing at 1.46 million, a rise of 50,000.</p>
<p>Prices of miscellaneous grains showed mixed movements. Soybean oil factories competed for yellow beans, with Hankou painted beans rising from 2.2 million to 2.25 million, an increase of 150,000. Local beans increased by 50,000, mung beans and sesame seeds increased by 100,000.</p>
<p>The rise in edible oil prices continued unabated, with lively trading and a vigorous market. Jilong-branded raw oil traded at 9.4 million, a sharp increase of 570,000. Local factory soybean oil reached a maximum price of 8 million, up 350,000. Chaozhou merchants eagerly bought soybean cakes, with Datong cakes reaching a new high price of 940,000, up 30,000.</p>

<h3>Sugar Prices Resume Upward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was bullish due to the rise in foreign exchange and the strengthening of the Taiwan dollar. Actual sales also became more active, and prices gradually rose.

<h3>Stimulated by Outside Forces, All Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were driven by external stimuli yesterday, and short sellers panicked, leading to intense gains. The after-market is even more bullish. Yong yarn exceeded the limit up, and all spot stocks hit the limit up, fiery and enthusiastic. The morning was initially calm, and inter-day trading was even more sparse, with no transactions. Yong yarn spot stock opened at 1540 yuan, briefly falling to 1525 yuan, then rising to 1610 yuan, and inter-day trading began at the same price. China Silk, Match, Xinyi, and Huaxin successively hit the limit up. Outside the market, commodity prices were bullish, and Hong Kong Electric shrank to 9 jiao and a half.

<p>Overseas Stocks</p>
<p>The private telegram from Hong Kong reported a significant shrinkage in foreign exchange yesterday. The black market surged, greatly boosting morale. The supply of retail investors was limited, and there were too many buyers. Securities firms and banks were all buying. Jardine Textiles opened at 2.05 million in the morning and closed at a new high price of nearly 2.40 million in the afternoon. The number of chips was limited, making it easy to rise sharply. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson rose by 10%, while rubber stocks, Jardine Textiles, Wheelock Marden, Yeguang Paper, Yap Bee, Steel, and Shipping rose by around 20%. Smaller stocks, in particular, were even more outstanding.</p>

<h3>Gold Market</h3>
<p>Is There Talk of Restoring Free Trading?</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the financial sector, the government will make changes to its control measures on gold and foreign exchange. On the gold side, it will be fully opened for free buying and selling. However, all firms engaged in gold trading must obtain a license from the Financial Management Bureau after review before they can officially operate. If the Bureau discovers that any firm is manipulating the market or raising prices, it can revoke its license. The control measures on foreign exchange will be changed to a linked import and export system, but the system will not be a free linkage system, but rather a limited linkage system. The authorities will still have regulations on the types and quantities of goods that can be imported and the types and quantities of goods that can be exported, to prevent excessive imports of non-essential goods from harming the foundation of domestic industry and commerce. The government is currently planning these two points in detail.</p>
<h3>Domestic Exchange Rate Revised</h3>
<p>The domestic exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be revised from the 8th as follows: Changsha and Hengyang each at 50 yuan, Lianyungang and Xinpu each at 20 yuan, Anqing at 20 yuan, Wuhu at 15 yuan, Shashi and Yidu each at 120 yuan, Nanchang at 50 yuan, Jingdezhen at 60 yuan, Jiujiang at 50 yuan, Ji'an and Ganzhou each at 70 yuan, Chongqing and Chengdu each at 20 yuan, and Yunnan at 90 yuan.</p>

<h3>Weekly Deposits Starting at 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Some banks in the city have started offering so-called "weekly deposits" since yesterday, with an interest rate of 2 jiao and 1 fen, for a term of seven days and a minimum deposit of 500,000 yuan. According to financial analysts, this new method is a transitional measure after the cancellation of inter-day trading, used to alleviate the difficulties of long positions. Once stock prices rise, this type of method will likely be canceled because the deposit interest is very high, and banks have no profit to be made when handling it.</p>
<h3>Settlement Issues Resolved for Consignment Export Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the issue of overdue foreign exchange settlements for export goods consigned by exporters, the Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association repeatedly requested the Central Bank to settle the payments at the current exchange rate.

Regarding overdue foreign exchange settlements for consigned export goods, this bureau has resolved a solution on March 21st of this year. Starting from April 1st, there will be a one-month period to settle at the current exchange rate. Overdue payments will still be handled according to Circular No. 111. Applications for price reductions or returns should be submitted to this bank for review.

<h3>Military Service Clarification (II) Written by the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>(1) Regarding exemption from military service: If a draftee is disabled, deformed, or has a chronic illness that makes him unfit for military service, his parents or he himself may fill out an application for exemption from military service and submit a medical certificate from a local registered hospital or registered qualified physician to the Bao Office to apply for exemption from military service. However, during the review of these applications, it was found that very few were truly disabled or deformed, and most were not chronic illnesses but could be treated. In other words, they could be fit for military service after treatment. Therefore, most of the applications based on this reason were mostly approved with the order "Rotational Conscription and Inspection", telling them to wait until the time of conscription and undergo another inspection. If they are truly ill, they will be rejected; otherwise, they should enlist in the camp according to the law. As for the physical standards of the draftees, they have been disclosed at the meeting of the Physical Examination Committee and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding criminal offences: Any draftee who has been sentenced to imprisonment of seven years or more is prohibited from serving in the military. If applying according to Article 20, Paragraph 3, and Article 26, Paragraph 5, a copy or photocopy of the judgment should be submitted as proof.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding going abroad on official business: Any draftee going abroad on official business must submit a passport or an official document approved by the National Government as proof.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding student deferment: Any draftee studying at a high school or above should submit a formal certificate from the school. Many people only submitted a certificate from the school's academic affairs office when applying, but because it was not a formal school certificate, it was rejected and a formal school certificate must be supplemented. Also, high school and university graduates are still subject to conscription, but those who have passed military training and obtained a military training certificate are considered to have the qualifications of reserve cadres and may not be conscripted. In January of this year, the Ministry of National Defense issued a telegram stating: "High school and university graduates are not subject to general conscription." However, the implementation of conscription this year is based on the regulations of the 36th year of the Republic of China, and laws cannot be retroactive. Therefore, this regulation must be implemented from the next year. High school and university graduates of the 36th year of the Republic of China will still be subject to general conscription unless there are other reasons.</p>

<h3>Clavijo's Embassy to Tamerlane</h3>
<p>By Tian Chunyin</p>
<p>Translated by Yang Dixian Shanghai First Edition, August 1947</p>
<p>The direct translation of the book's name should be "A Journey from Cadiz to Samarkand during the Time of Timur." The original author was Ruy Gonzales de Clavijo, the envoy of the Kingdom of Castile (one of the predecessors of Spain) to Timur, chronicling his journey. The translator believes that "records of Central Asian history and geography are few in number. Researchers in both the East and West are troubled by the lack of materials, so Clavijo's book can be said to be an important record that followed in the footsteps of Marco Polo's travels." This assessment is accurate. In the "Historical Materials" chapter of Lucien Bouvat's *The Mongol Empire* (Paris, 1927), translated by Feng Chengjun, Clavijo is also mentioned as having "left behind a rather interesting narrative that has been published and translated many times." Bouvat's book is of particular value for the 15th century, and Clavijo's book is certainly valuable as a reference. At that time, there were many emissaries from China's Ming Dynasty to the Western Regions. Feng Chengjun once examined the names of these envoys. According to the *History of the Ming Dynasty: Western Regions*, they included Chuan An, Guo Ji, Chen Dewen, Chen Cheng, Ba Tai, Li Da, Bai A'er Xintai, Lu An, Li Luo, Jin Halanbo, Guo Jing, Li Gui, Hai Rong, Ma Quan, Ma Yun, and Zhan Sheng. It seems that only Chen Cheng wrote a travelogue. Chen Cheng repeatedly served as an envoy to the Western Regions. His *Records of the Western Regions Foreign Countries* is also a valuable material for studying the history and geography of the Timurid era. Yang Dixian believes that Clavijo's book is better than Chen Cheng's because the former is not averse to being detailed, striving for comprehensiveness, and recording his own experiences truthfully. As a result, we can use this book to glimpse the outline of Central Asian society at that time.</p>
<p>Although Timur's establishment of a kingdom in the Western Regions did not match the vastness of Genghis Khan's empire or its longevity, it did encompass the territory of Central Asia, lasting for six generations and more than ten rulers. His empire existed only during the reigns of Timur and Shah Rukh. After Shah Rukh, there were only separatist lords; there was no longer a monarch capable of ruling the entire country. Therefore, the capital of the empire was sometimes in Samarkand and sometimes in Herat. However, almost all of the separatist figures were descendants of Timur. Although there was no longer a prosperous empire, it was still the Timurid Dynasty. Although the empire collapsed not long after, as Timur had predicted, and was finally destroyed in 1502, the new country built by its descendants in India continued until 1857. Bouvat said, "Although the establishment of a nation by Timur and his successor-monarchs did not last, their influence was quite the opposite. We can say that the fate of Asia and Europe was partly caused by Timur's work. The influence of the brilliant Timurid culture on Islamic culture can only be compared with the culture of the prosperous era of the Caliph (Islamic leader). Therefore, Timur was the most shocking of the Mongol monarchs to the Europeans. His defeat of Bayezid, the Sultan of Constantinople, was tantamount to prolonging the remnant fortunes of the Eastern Roman Empire, and its contribution was even greater than that of the European crusades. Therefore, Clavijo was ordered to cross the Turkish forces, which were regarded as "Sache," to ally with Timur to the east. After Timur galloped through Central Asia, Persia, India, the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor, he also wanted to invade China to the east. At that time, China was ruled by the ambitious Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. If the two heroes had met, the face of the history of Sino-Western exchanges would have changed greatly. Although Clavijo's book has no system for all of Timur's literary and martial governance, it is indeed a detailed side view, which not only allows us to clearly understand the faces and moods of the characters who stirred up the situation in Central Asia, but also can fill the missing pages of our country's Western Xinjiang history. Furthermore, Clavijo's book records the historical and geographical situation of the Eastern Roman Empire, Italian city-states, and Asia Minor around the 15th century, which can also be used as a reference for Western history, enabling readers to outline and compare, and there are indeed many first-class historical materials.</p>
<p>The translator's source is the Turkish translation by O'mer Riza Dogtul, which he then re-translated, along with the summary attached by the Turkish translator. The main text consists of seventeen chapters. Chapters 12-15 describe his observations of Samarkand and Timur. Although the book is prone to inaccuracies, most of it is reliable and can be called the highest in terms of historical value. The Turkish translator also based his translation on Turkish records, detailing important personal and place names. Yang Dixian, considering that there are many textual researchers related to Central Asian history and geography in Chinese records, selected the important ones and attached them after each chapter. There is a lot of information about China, which is most helpful to domestic readers. However, it is a pity that a route map is missing. The translation is clear. Although there are occasional differences in literary language, it is simple and pleasing, wanting to preserve the original intention of the text.</p>
<p>There are few records of Central Asian history and figures, and the destruction is even more severe. During the late Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people had a great interest in studying the geography of the Northwest, but the achievements cannot be said to be many. If you don't know many languages and translate the first-rate works of Central Asia and the West, you won't achieve success. In recent times, Zhang Xinglang, Feng Chengjun, Xiang Da and others have made great achievements in this area. Yang's translation is indeed worthy of praise, because it helps to fill the gaps in Chinese and foreign history in many places. The author of this article knows nothing about Turkish and Clavijo's original Spanish text, so I dare not praise the translation itself. However, I hope to briefly introduce the importance and value of his work to the Chinese people in an interesting way.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Art</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>By E. Grosse, translated by Chen Yi, published by Datong Bookstore</p>
<p>This world-renowned book already has two Chinese translations. Chen Yi's translation in 1933, titled "The Origin of Art," was published by Datong, while Cai Muhui's translation in 1937, titled "The Origin of Art," was published by Commercial Press. From the perspective of fluency and readability, Chen's translation is superior to Cai's, so I will introduce Chen's version.</p>
<p>Historically, studies of the origin of art have often neglected concrete facts and basic artistic phenomena, instead delving into metaphysical depths, flaunting stale philosophical terms and abstract artistic concepts, resulting in confusion and failing to achieve thorough understanding or new inspiration. In other words, this is due to neglecting the inevitable conclusion of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>Dr. Ernst Grosse, born in 1862, was a German art historian who studied ancient art in Japan. Using an anthropological and cultural historical perspective, he studied primitive art. This book, "The Origin of Art," completed in 1912, is a great work. He pioneered the use of scientific research methods, and his meticulous examination, extensive citations, and penetrating judgments have ensured his lasting fame.</p>
<p>Grosse states in the preface to this book: "This book is the first attempt—to explore a realm that no one has ever ventured into before." This is indeed not a boast. Let's look at its content.</p>
<p>Chapter 1, "The Purpose of Art Science," explains art history, art philosophy, and art science, and discusses the problems, scope, and value of art science.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, "The Method of Art Science," presents Dubos, Helder, Taine, Hennepuin, Guyan, and the method of comparative ethnology, research on primitive art forms, and the collection and interpretation of materials.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, "Primitive Peoples," describes the conditions of primitive peoples, tribal production, culture, family, religion, and their current situation.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, "Art," explains the nature of artistic activity, belonging to social phenomena and social mechanisms.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, "Body Decoration," this chapter is the richest part of the book, presenting various body decorations of many existing primitive peoples, such as body painting, scarification, tattooing, ear and nose ornaments, hair, head, neck, waist, and limb decorations, and clothing decorations, and concludes that the meanings of these decorations are threefold: (1) to attract the opposite sex, (2) to intimidate opponents, and (3) to mark social status.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, "Decoration," collects handicrafts, utensils, and other objects used among primitive peoples, and studies the patterns, changes, and meanings of their decorations.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, "Descriptive Art," describes the cave paintings of primitive people, carvings on stone walls, and paintings on bark. It also explains the relationship with primitive production and compares it with children's painting art.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, "Dance," explains that primitive dance is practiced, simulated, religious, and its social significance.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, "Poetry," in addition to analyzing the lyrical and narrative nature of primitive poetry, it also discusses primitive novels, stories, dramas, myths, etc., which can be said to be a very extensive study of the literature of primitive peoples.</p>
<p>Chapter 10, "Music," describes primitive vocal and instrumental music, and explains its relationship with poetry and dance.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, "Conclusion," in this chapter, it first reviews the research that has been done, and points out that art is a means of survival competition, and further explains the social and personal significance of art.</p>
<p>This book has at least two advantages:</p>
<p>(1) It attempts to synthesize art philosophy and art history to establish a system of art science or art sociology. In addition to psychological and sociological methods, it also indicates the method of comparative anthropology, which is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>(2) It discovers the social function of art as a means of survival competition from the most rudimentary works of art, and denies Taine's and others' arguments that the roots of art formation are climate, ethnicity, environment, era, as well as intellectual and moral customs, which is the second point worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Although Grosse's research object is only the art of existing primitive peoples, not the art of the Stone Age; the incorrectness of the order of occurrence of various arts, and ignoring: "Labor, music and poetry were initially fused into a trinity, and the basic element was labor... the origin of poetry is in the labor process." (See K. Bucher's "Labor and Rhythm"), as well as some contradictions and debatable points, it still has its unique value.</p>
<h3>Literary Chinese Function Words</h3>
<p>— Zhu Dashou</p>
<p>(By Lü Shuxiang, one of the "Opening Light Youth" books)</p>
<p>Function words in classical Chinese are the biggest headache for students, and ordinary Chinese teachers just vaguely gloss over them when explaining them. As a result, students are even more unable to understand the usage and meaning of empty words—even if students look up the dictionary themselves, they cannot get a detailed and clear explanation, such as "其, 指物詞，助洞." or "與, 及也，給予也." How can such annotations enable students to understand?</p>
<p>This book, "Literary Chinese Function Words," focuses on the commonly used words and common usages in ordinary literary Chinese.</p>
<p>The entire book has twelve chapters, discussing about twenty words, which seems insufficient, but in the current situation of lacking similar publications, it can already solve the difficulties students encounter with function words. The explanation of each word is indeed very detailed, with each word divided into several categories, explaining its usage and meaning separately. At the end of each chapter, there are exercises, which can give students a deeper memory and the opportunity to develop themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope the author can continue to write, insert it in the next reprint, or publish a sequel separately to supplement it.</p>
<h3>On Soviet Literature</h3>
<p>— Weiming</p>
<p>Although the title is "On Soviet Literature," it clearly reflects the spiritual inclination of English literature.</p>
<p>The preface of the book contains an introductory text, which says: "The Literary Group of the Soviet Cultural Association once proposed that British and Soviet countries should exchange opinions on literary issues in writing through questions and answers. After the Soviet writers sent their proposals to England, writers in London and other cities in England had extensive discussions. After answering these questions, the British writers also raised many questions to their Soviet friends. These questions were discussed several times by the Literary Group of the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the answers were sent to England. What is published here is the majority of the Soviet writers' replies."</p>
<p>This book, although not a systematic discussion, is very broad in scope because it takes the form of questions and answers. It ranges from the travel experiences of a writer to the characteristics and spirit of Soviet literature. Therefore, this booklet can indeed leave a very deep impression on people about Soviet literature. Now, I will briefly describe it.</p>
<p>, is about the publication of works, sales statistics, the living conditions of writers and their social status, and the distribution of libraries. The next is about the training of young writers, the characteristics of Soviet literature, and the impact of cultural exchange between the two countries. Finally, it is about answering many specific questions. Because everything is done in a relatively free way, many questions are quite interesting to ask. Such as: "Can detective novels exist in the Soviet Union?" "Does the Soviet Union have laws on defamation?" etc.</p>
<p>At the same time, because these questions are raised, and everything is done in a relatively free way, this book gives us more understanding in the way the questions are asked—understanding the spiritual state of British writers today. For example, here, they raise many questions:</p>
<p>"Is there 'pure' literature in the Soviet Union? That is, novels that set the background of the work before the First World War without involving modern turmoil? For example, works by François Mauriac in France, Walder and Trammell in English literature? Is there 'art for art's sake' that does not contain social education meaning?"</p>
<p>"I often feel that there is a striking blood relationship between the temperament of classical Greece and the temperament of Russia; such as Euripides and Turgenev, and the orators of ancient Athens and Stalin. Is this just a coincidence? Or is it a legacy of classical Greece passed down through Byzantium (the old site of Constantinople)?"</p>
<p>"Which modern Soviet writer do you think has a satirical genius comparable to Zoshchenko?"</p>
<p>"Do you think contemporary Soviet novels are mainly about mass psychology? Or do they focus more on portraying individual characters?"</p>
<p>"Is there any contemporary Soviet writer whose 'mission' is equivalent to Dostoevsky—such as the spirit of 'mutual love' expressed in the two characters of Father Zosima and Prince Myshkin?"</p>
<p>And from all these questions, such as their high evaluation of Zoshchenko, and that kind of history and perspective, we clearly recognize that English literature today is wandering in a dark situation and constantly declining.</p>
<p>I really like this form of question and answer, especially the free use of this form. Therefore, everything is brought up without any concealment. The good results created by mutual frankness are predictable and appreciable.</p>
<p>It is a pity that this is only a part of the questions and answers, and the answers of the British writers to the Soviet writers' questions have not been translated. But what do these count for? What is placed before us is the usefulness and interest of this book.</p>
<h3>Guidance for Algebra Exercises</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>(Compiled and translated by: Xue Dejiong, Publisher: New Asia Bookstore, Price: 2.80 yuan.)</p>
<p>This book is written based on the book by Japanese author Yoshizo Fujimori. There is an introduction before the book, which instructs the method of learning algebra, and specifically explains the advantages and disadvantages of the two learning methods. These two methods are the systematic learning method and the mixed learning method, and the author advocates adopting the systematic learning method, because the mixed learning method is time-consuming and laborious, and not as convenient as the systematic learning method. And the correctness and speed of calculation are what the author believes must be paid attention to. Therefore, the introduction will be of great help to learners, and readers of this book should not omit it.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into two volumes; the upper volume is divided into two parts, and the lower volume is divided into five parts. The first part discusses the deformation of expressions; the second part discusses equations; the third part discusses simple inequalities; the fourth part discusses the application of equations; the fifth part discusses series; the sixth part is logarithms; the seventh part is the calculation of six numbers.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole book, we can get its advantages as follows:</p>
<p>1.  There are no troublesome and profound theories, and research is only done on methods. This is the biggest advantage of this book, and it can also be said to be the difference between this book and other books. General textbooks have more theories and fewer practical problems. The so-called practical problems are the methods of solving problems. This book is all about introducing many methods of solving problems, so that people will not be at a loss after learning. Many methods in this book are not found in other books. Many difficult problems simply have no methods to solve in ordinary books, but this book introduces clever methods, which easily solve them.</p>
<p>2.  Printing is top-notch, which is an advantage of this book. This book is printed on white newspaper, so there is no feeling of blurring, and it also increases the value of this book!</p>
<p>3.  This book can be used as a preparation book for promotions or exams, because this book is all about methods of solving problems, which are systematically introduced to you, so that you will not be at a loss when doing problems. Moreover, the most enjoyable thing about doing math problems is getting them right the first time, and the most painful thing is getting them wrong or not having a method to solve them. Therefore, after reading this book, you can arouse your interest, and you can get endless fun when doing problems. I advise every young student to read this book to lay a solid foundation for your mathematics. This book is even more suitable for self-learners.</p>
<h3>Review of "Martine"</h3>
<p>— Ruofei</p>
<p>A Sketch of Rural Love</p>
<p>I have rarely read the plays of Er, but this time I happened to read his early work "Martine" (translated by Lin Ke), and I was deeply impressed. Perhaps there is no other reason, just because the author expresses the truth of life—no, he simply extracts fragments of life directly, delves into the core of life, and after dissecting it, he reproduces it on paper one by one. He depicts love, but even more he writes out the human touch. In the small five scenes, he reveals the secrets of a girl's soul, tempers and grinds it, the whole play is filled with a bleak atmosphere, in a situation where one has to recall but cannot bear to look back, anyone will taste this strong tea-like human touch.</p>
<p>The story is very simple, directly writing about the little girl who suffers from love, which is "a simple experience of a tiny soul". The five scenes write out the atmosphere in five different environments.</p>
<p>As the translator said, "The whole play does not have any amazing strokes from beginning to end. However, the purity of the texture, the rigor of the composition, and the pastoral elegance and desolation are still very rare in contemporary works."</p>
<p>No climax, no foreshadowing, and no tortuous desolation, it is also a depiction of rural love. A story that can happen in any village, characters that can exist in any village. The most realistic opening, the most bleak ending.</p>
<p>What convinces me is that Bairna used a few strokes to express the taste of love in the entire human world.</p>
<p>Speaking of Martine. Martine, a simple village girl, has a simple and kind heart. Before Julien arrived in Gangshan Village, Martine was satisfied with everything around him—the scenery of Gangshan Village, his family, and the people in his family, and even Alfred, who had been pursuing him. But due to the encounter under the apple tree, plus Julien's teasing, this girl's heart was shaken, as if someone had removed the heavy obstacles in her eyes, she valued herself more, and only valued Julien more. —She then had her dreams.</p>
<p>Her dream is beautiful, night after night, day after day, she has her fantasies and desires. Maybe she is not wrong, a girl cannot be responsible for herself, the one who should be responsible should be Julien.</p>
<p>He teased her, lifted her up, but turned his back and called her "wild grass and flowers".</p>
<p>Maybe, he is not wrong either, in the face of "emotion", they are both captives. Without saying who won or who surrendered, just look at the scene in the last act where the author secretly set up a meeting for the two, Julien's injury, Martine's crying, everything is explained.</p>
<p>Poor Martine, poor Julien, plus a poor Sanne, formed this scene of love dispute. The happy one is still Alfred, he does not know the inside story, and is at a loss.</p>
<p>I thought of a poem by Blake, and I thought of Hakuson Kuriyagawa's "Philosophy of Love".</p>
<p>To put it more realistically, Martine and Julien together are not a good match. Letting Julien have a little bit of Romantic memories is a pleasure in life, and letting Martine have such a fantasy that can never be achieved is a pain in life.</p>
<p>To put it more realistically, the encounter under the apple tree ruined Martine, but it also enlightened Martine. She could have spent her whole life in a daze, but now she has great pain—this is tragedy, Martine's tragedy.</p>
<p>The philosopher said: "Let your understanding of love destroy you, and willingly and joyfully bleed." Martine! Maybe her great pain contains great joy.</p>
