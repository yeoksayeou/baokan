<h3>屢載違反出版法文字　京新民報受停刊處分</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕南京新民報八日巳受永久停刊之處分。據內政部方面消息，該報屢次刊登為匪宣傳文字，散布謠言，煽惑人心，近更變本加厲，謊報事實，誣蔑國軍妨害戡亂軍事，實遠反出版法第廿一條第二三兩款，「出版品不得爲損害中華民國利益及破壞公共秩序之宣傳或紀載」之規定，乃依照同法第卅二條之規定，予以永久停刊處分。內政部於八日下午五時半頒發命令，飭南京市社會局執行，社會局即於七時半會同首都警察廳，派員將此項命令送　新民報負責人。</p>
<p>內政部發言人之談話</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕內政部發言人爲南京新民報停刊處分事，發表談話稱：南京新民報屢次刊登爲匪官傳文字，散布謠言，煽惑人心，沮喪士氣，幷時載挑撥離間羣民及地方團隊情感之新聞通訊及言論，近更變本加厲，謊報事實，誣衊國軍，爲共顫張目，茲為使社會人士明瞭眞象，洞悉事實計，特擇要說明如次：</p>
<p>（一）爲共匪宣傳，誇大匪軍戰力。該報六月十日載「大別山的鋸屑」一文，竟宣傳共匪劉伯承進大別山裏　脅結果，巳擴充到牙八萬人。四月廿八日「傳作義聶榮臻比氣」又宣傳聶匪榮臻的部隊已從十萬人擴充到十五萬人。這都是該張匪勢，動搖人心的宣傳記載。五月廿七日「從春到夏的東北」載「在補給重於作戰的原則下，東北一萬三千多公里的鐵路百分之九十以上已爲八路控制，八路不但沒有扒路，反而在修路」。共匪到處破壤鐵路，阻碍交通，爲中外人士所共知之事實，該報竟掩飾共匪之罪行，宣傳匪區之建設，謂非爲匪張目，其誰置信。</p>
<p>（二）故意散布謠言，擾亂社會人心。查宜昌爲川鄂豫數省間之重鎭，共匪始終並未竄入，更無被圍之事，該報六月廿六日謂「宜昌之圍即解除」，空谷來音，顯係故意暗不宜禺將被包圍，捏造事實，搖惑人心。四月七日該報「香港的野風」一文載稱：「左派人士認爲共匪必定渡江，最早可能即在最近，最遲亦不會遲過五月一，此項記載顯係爲匪誇大宣傳，現巳七月初，共匪不僅尚未渡江，且匪軍在中原戰事失敗之後，將永無渡江之烯望，此種事實，足以證明該報爲匪虛張聲勢，意存恫嚇之企圖。五月一日「透視大巴山防務」一文，說共匪在川潛力甚大，其搖惑人心，擾亂後方，更爲明顯。</p>
<p>（三）謊報事實，誣蔑國軍。該報四月十四日「雲西北戰局」一文，謂「國軍甲區拼命，乙區作臘上觀，河南緊張，不管山東，關中急就不管洛陽」，又說「國軍受制於人」，及在四月十八日「張家口一度緊張」文內，謂「國軍所俘共匪雖多，但都是被人俘去的國軍」，這都是動搖國軍士氣的反宣傳。又該報「憶宛西民團」一文，肆意侮辱團隊，離間軍民感情，並暗示匪軍佔領宛西以後川鄂形勢之危急，以誇張匪勢。又六月廿六日「開對逃京學生鋒鏑餘生談洗刧」一文，竟謂開封商業區大小建築都被空軍炸平，被炸死傷者六七萬人。查我空軍並無該報所述濫建轟炸之事實，巳由河南大學校長姚從吾之談話爲其證明，該報竟乘豫東戰事吃緊之時，捏造事實，企圖刺激社會，發動輿論，反對空軍對顫部之轟炸。似此造謠惑衆，妨礙戡亂軍事之言論新聞，不一而足。</p>
<p>以上所指，不過摘其最顯著之事件，此外言論，小品，新聞，通訊有同樣之性質及企圖者，本部均擇尤存案，隨時可備查考，凡此種種，無一不是蓄意傳播謠言，動搖人心，毀謗國軍，妨害戡亂軍事，實違反出版法第廿一條第二三兩款：出版品不得爲損害中華民國利益及破壞公共秩序之宣傳或紀載之規定，爲依照同法第卅二條規定，予以永久停刊處分。</p>
<p>政府對於言論出版自由，依法保障，而對於文化新聞事業，向極愛護，幷盡力扶助其發展，惟在比戡亂時期，如有妨害軍事，觸犯法令之言行，責無法曲予宥容，不得不依法予以制裁，此爲今日必須鄭重向國人告者。</p>

<h3>漢空軍出動多批　搜索豫南鄂北匪踪</h3>

<h3>中原會戰總檢討　國防部政工局發表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕國防部政工局頃發表「中原會戰總檢討」，全文如次：</p>
<p>（一）顫之企圖</p>
<p>自從劉顫伯承渡河流竄華中以來，一籌莫展，陳毅陳賡股匪，雖不斷聲援接濟，亦少成就，如是自本年一月起，陳毅乃結集所屬匪部一，四，六，及兩廣快速縱隊，還有劉伯承匪十一縱隊及陳匪三，八，總部之一部，於黃河北岸集中整補，加強訓練，處心積累，專以攻打我第五軍第十八軍爲對策，經過五個月之補充與準備，於六月初旬再度渡河到魯西，實行其所謂夏季攻勢陰謀，與我國軍決一死戰，打破國軍六月肅淸華中計劃。</p>
<p>（二）匪我態勢</p>
<p>陳匪此次竄擾中原，可謂傾巢來犯，主力一，三，四，六，兩廣，快速，共六個縱隊，晋冀豫魯邊區之民衆，幾巳全部動員，其左側更有膠東許世友率領之新七，八，九，十三，等縱隊圍攻兗州，三，八，十，縱隊攻打開封，更有劉伯承的一，二，三，六，縱隊及陳賡之第四，九，縱隊，與徐向前由晋南調派之二個縱隊，在平漢綫及其兩側牽制國軍增援，合計約二十個縱隊，兵力共三十多萬人，竄犯之前，朱德曾親赴魯西，集合詎官兵訓話，誓言不消滅第五軍不再姓朱之說，初犯開封，繼行決戰。</p>
<p>國軍兵力初屬劣勢，魯西戰鬥旬日，匪毫無所獲，繼以豫西竄來匪第三，八，十，等縱隊乘虛攻陷我開封，國軍星夜馳援，匪乃乘勢竄集杞縣睢縣一帶，與國軍進行決戰。</p>
<p>（三）作戰經過</p>
<p>陳毅一，四，六，兩廣，快速，等縱隊，及劉伯承一，十一，兩縱隊，再加上從開封敗退下來的陳毅三，八，十縱隊，及土共金紹山，魏鳳樓等部，總數達十五萬人，從上月廿八日起，被國軍包圍在睢縣杞縣中間地區，猛加痛擊，匪軍拚死掙扎，至本月初，戰事愈益激烈，匪陸續增援在楡廂舖，龍王店，等地，以優勢兵力，向我留死反撲，雙方反復衝殺，屢進屢退，最初三日，我七十五師及新二十一旅經過連續五日之激戰，曾受重大損失，繼被國罩左右兩翼的強大兵團分向帝邱店（楡廂鋪東），桃林崗（楡廂西）等地合力夾擊，加上空軍的猛烈轟炸，至七月四日爲止，匪軍傷亡已逾四萬人。四日以後，匪在我反包圍圈中狼奔豕突，無法脫圍，糧彈將盡，補給困難，傷亡遍野，逃散陡增，至是匪始知大勢巳去，無法挽回，加以空軍連日以大編隊向匪軍陣地不斷猛炸，匪之陣地，巳全被炸毀，匪軍死傷尤爲慘重，匪之高級指揮所，亦被擊毀多處，匪掙扎至七日淸晨，巳至無法支持，乃開始全面潰退，除陳毅匪部主力六個縱隊殘部，仍向魯西方面逃竄，其三，八縱隊，與劉匪所部及土共金紹山，魏鳳樓等匪部，則向南逃竄，國軍正繼續追擊，會戰至此暫告段落。</p>
<p>（四）會戰檢討</p>
<p>自下睢，杞，通許一帶，死尸遍野，匪軍所遺軍用品與尸體錯雜遺棄，縱横五十華里之原野，到處皆是，足見其失敗之慘。從上月廿六日會戰開始以來，迄七日匪全面敗退爲止，匪傷亡逃散，總數連同民兵土共巳逾八萬以上，其一，四，縱隊損失過半，第六及兩廣縱隊損失將近半數，三，八，十，十一，快速等縱隊各損失三分之一不等，爲匪南竄以來所受之最大打擊。匪軍雖自詡善於補充，此次元氣大傷，損失慘重，恐非三個月所能整補完成。我在此次會戰中，雖亦損失一師一旅之衆，傷亡與匪爲三與一之比，但顫準備半年所欲　成之企圖，巳告粉碎，中原戰局從此次勝利中，巳轉危爲安，今後華中總體戰，如能與全國總動員，切實配合進行，則匪軍今後之流竄，必處處遭受決定性之打擊。</p>

<h3>社論　黃泛區大會戰的捷報</h3>
<p>豫東黃泛區的大會戰，經我忠勇將士浴血苦饑了九晝夜，終於獲得了空前大捷！這一次大捷，不僅粉碎了匪軍欲從豫西威脅江·淮·徐·泗之間的企圖，而且也已達成了捕捉匪軍主力的殲滅戰之初步任務。竄集通許以南杞睢兩縣問之陳毅·劉伯承·陳賡三匪所部的主力二十萬人，已被殲滅過半，殘匪一部份北越　海路向魯西竄逃，另一部份則自杞睢地區向西南逃竄，國軍正在强大空軍掩護之下，乘勝分路向逃匪追剿。這個具有決定性的空前大捷，正在七七抗戰紀念日傳到全國各地，人心爲之一振，無不特別感覺與奮。這是剿匪軍事一年來最大的戰果，以視今年五月初涇渭河谷的殲滅大捷，尤爲重要，有人比擬爲東晋　水之戰，其實此不僅如淝水之戰奠定東晋偏安之局，乃是穩定華中，規復華北，兩年來剿匪軍事的轉捩點。</p>
<p>我們檢討最近一年來的戡亂軍事，共匪所採取的戰略，原爲一種「運動戰」，東流西竄，在表面上看來，似乎沒有一定的目標，但在實際上，共匪專門向國軍防綫的弱點進攻，乘虛而入，以「大」吃「小」，所謂出其不意攻其無備，並無多大神秘。其實這種「運動戰」，就是共匪過去所採取的游擊戰的化身，其所不同的，游擊戰的目的，僅在破壞交通及擾亂地方秩序，而目前的運動戰，其目的嚴然要想攻佔大據點，於是「運動戰」之外也不能不夾打陣地頭了。從今年三月間攻佔洛陽開始，至六月間一度攻入開封爲止，可以說是共匪採用運動戰略的黃金時代，而在國軍方面，一則因爲守士有責，對於任何據點，均不能輕言放棄，另則由於初期指揮的朱盡統一，國軍在作戰方面顯然缺少一種機動性，乃反致陷於多少被動的地位。中原名城洛陽開封的先後一度淪於匪手，不能不說是國軍戰略錯誤所致。</p>
<p>上次開封的一度陷落，雖然曾形成中原的危局，引起輿論的沸騰，但是也給國軍一個痛苦的敎訓。後來開封迅速收復，黃泛區合圍的形成，以及這次殲滅戰的大捷，實在是我軍事當局「明恥敎戰」和改變戰略的重大收獲。我們觀察這次中原會戰的經過，不難指出這次國軍大捷的原因：（一）在國軍機動性的充分發揮，不僅能把握戎機，捕捉到匪軍的主力，而且行軍迅速，立即形成對匪軍主力的合圍，使匪軍的「遝動戰」戰略無從運用；（二）在國軍方面的陸空兩軍緊密的配合作戰，使匪軍逃不出　被殲滅的厄運。</p>
<p>開封是六月二十二日淪於匪手的。因爲這一中原名城的得失，不特有關河南一省的安危，而且足以影響及於整個戰局，所以國軍分三路疾趨赴援，一自蘭封西進，二自鄭州東進，三日對氏北上，至廿五日即會師汴城。印兵團於廿六日首先進入開封城，此一中原重鎮即告收復。當時匪軍向東南竄入黃泛區之後，一則因區匪的「輕敵」心理，一　其過去「避實就虛」的戰略，仍集中主力於杞睢之間，用陣地戰的方略妄圖一　，另則格於中原的地理形勢，在一片大平原的黃泛區，欲流竄他處而不受我空軍的追擊，勢有所不可能，乃使匪軍不得不集中主力，與國軍主力會戰，拚一個「你死我活」的大決戰。會戰從六月廿八日揭開其血幕，國軍於廿九日淸晨，克復杞縣，殲滅匪軍一千餘人，迫令陳匪主力蝟集睢縣。這是國軍在這次會戰中的初試鋒鋩，也是這次殲滅戰大捷的前奏。從此雙方在杞·睢·通許三縣地帶的包圍與反包圍陣地，作出生入死的搏鬥，我强大的空軍，更隨時與陸軍協同作戰，期將此陳毅陳賡劉伯承三匪主力殲滅於黃泛區。我最高統帥也曾於本月二日一度飛往黃泛區戰塲上空巡視，國軍士氣益加振奮，於二日上午國軍已獲得第一回合的勝利，粉碎了匪軍「以大吃小」的企圖。而且當西進兵團與匪戰於睢縣東之帝邱店地區時，東進兵團也已克復了睢縣西之韓寨，於是完成了合圍的形勢。國軍以三個師爲核心陣地，以內綫作戰吸引匪軍，而邱·胡·孫三兵團則在外綫，對匪軍作大包圍，使匪軍成爲「三明治」中的「火腿」，其大部可被殲滅的命運殆已決定於我統帥部的帷幄中了。前天捷報頻傳，早已在我們意料之中，而且我們可以斷言，日內還將有更可喜的驚人消息傳來。</p>
<p>由上所述，可知黃泛區大會戰的勝利，除了靠我陸軍忠勇將士的效命而外，空軍的協同作戰，也是這次達成殲滅戰的決定因素之一。我們雖不完全相信「空軍決勝」，但是對付共匪飄忽無定的「運動戰」，欲求制服之策，非由空軍與陸軍協同作戰不可的。最近社會上茶些人士，企圖　　一種「反轟炸運動」，表面上說好像爲了人道，但其實際，無非替共匪的缺　設　，要帮共匪找一個　口，用「人道」的大帽子來限制我空軍活動，迫使我國軍東手挨打而已！須知他們如果眞是誠意講人道，就該力勸共匪洗心革面，放下武器，作一個自新的國民，不再作叛國的勾當，則漫天烽烟，立可消散，又何勞國軍大舉掃蕩？難道只有共匪殺人放火爭城奪地算合乎人道，而國軍陸空配合，痛掃逆匪，恢復秩序，安定人心，反是違背人道不成？我們不僅不能爲這些別有作用的怪論所惑，而且更應歌頌空軍的威力確有貢獻於國家。</p>
<p>要之，這次黃泛區的勝利不絮爲我國剿匪軍事上的一大轉捩點，從合圍到殲滅，無一不足爲我國剿匪的示範。從此全國部隊均將改變戰略，振奮士氣，充分發揮軍隊的機動性，捕捉到匪軍的主力，一鼓殲滅，並揭示全國上下週知，今後我國剿匪軍事的目標，不在一城一地的得失，而在殲滅匪軍的多寡。惟其如此，我們對於頻自黃泛區傳來的捷報，還不能樂觀過早。現在匪軍殘部正分向東北，東南，及西北三方面奪路逃竄，並且竄逃魯西及皖北的兩股大有進窺徐州的妄圖，故徐州大會戰似又在醞釀之中。我陸空軍自應乘勝追則，務使漏網的匪軍不能再在他處得逞。我們在此，以萬分熱誠，期待徐州會戰的又一大捷！</p>

<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕董顯光局長今日在記者招待會答復關於政府收復開封後有何善後措施之詢問時稱：社會部谷部長正綱前往開封督辦救濟事宜，業已公畢返京，據吿：政府收復開封後，第一步爲調查開封居民所受損失及傷亡人數。　據人口統計，開封失陷前，約有四萬二千戶，該城光復之後，曾以同數之調查表分發各戶長，經市參議會，各學校，各公私團體之協助，推行調查工作，塡復調查表者共有四萬份以上，根據此項調查，開封人民之損失及傷亡人數如下：（一）開封房屋損壞統計：（甲）民房共計二〇二八二間，焚燬八二三七間，炸塌四九五九間，破壞七〇八六間。（乙）學校共計二九三〇，焚燬一〇一五間，炸塌一〇二七，被損八七八。（丙）機關共計二四五五，焚燬一〇七六，炸塌四一四，破損九六五。（丁）總計二五六六七間，焚燬一〇三二八，炸塌六四一〇，破損八九二九。（四）開封人口傷亡統計：（甲）流動人口死亡四三二人，受傷共五六四人，重一八五人，輕三七九人。（乙）居民死亡一〇七八人，受傷共一五五七人，重五二〇人，輕一〇三七人。（丙）公役死亡一九，受傷共四一，重八，輕三三。（丁）學生死亡三六，受傷共七五，重二一，輕五四。（戊）公敎人員死亡二二，受傷共四二，重十，輕三二。總計死亡一五八七，受傷二二七九，重七四四，輕一五三五。谷部長繼稱：死亡之三十六名學生中，屬於國立河南大學者三名，彼等之死，並非由於轟炸，而係由於其他原因。河南大學校舍損失甚微，至報載空軍濫炸之說，絕對不確，據谷部長稱：空軍轟炸及掃射目標僅爲共匪陣地，流彈及彈片容或傷及無辜，但絕非故意。</p>

<h3>關於西德問題六國協定　英美氣絕波蘭抗議　德局勢混亂不安咎在蘇聯　波蘭利益未被顧及應向蘇提出申訴</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕彼蘭於六月十八日向英美提出照會，抗議倫敦六國會議之決議。英美乃於今日個別向波蘭提出答覆，拒絕波蘭之抗議，聲明西方國家所採之幷動，係因蘇聯拒不合作被迫而採取，故波蘭之抗議實應向蘇聯提出。</p>
<p>英政府覆文　聲明英國之不滿四强之不獲關於德國之協議，殊不亞於波蘭。英美法三國固曾一再企圖獲致協議，彼蘭政府旣支援蘇對德之政策，殊不解波蘭之抗議係基於何種理由，西方盟國努力獲致四强協議之不獲成功，實緣蘇聯一再阻撓之故。查英國與彼蘭於一九三九年曾有互助公約之訂，蘇聯雖曾與德訂立互不侵犯條約而便利德國之變動，而英國仍爲首先對德宣戰援助彼蘭之國，英國對於彼蘭之利益亦始終予以充分的承認。至於西方强國關於魯爾之協定將便利德國侵略之說，亦屬不確。英國已採取每一可能的措施，以防德國之再侵略，而關於魯爾之協定，可確保德國不致妄用其經濟能力供侵略之用，倫敦會議並未討論賠償問題，波蘭可以確信英國必能認識其關於此事之責任。倫敦會議中關於西德未來政治組織之規定，係本於聯邦制度，最適合於使德國民主化之信念。目前歐洲令人遺憾的局勢，直接應由蘇聯負責　而波蘭政府旣支持蘇聯之態度，則如邀請波蘭與英政府就有關德國之事務交換意見，在目前環境下，非特無用，且將使波蘭政府對蘇之關係陷於窘境。英政府抱有決心，決不分裂德國，或使堅强之德國復活，波蘭政府於此殊無恐懼之必要。但英政府必須採取必要的行動，以應付當前的局勢，而此一局勢之形成，固非英國所應負責。</p>
<p>美照會內容　美副國務卿洛維特今日在華盛頓以照會一紙，交波蘭駐美大使，照會內容亦囑波蘭政府應向蘇聯政府提出其對倫敦會議決議案之申訴。並曰，被德侵略最甚之國，如以爲彼等之利益，未被倫教會議之計劃所顧及，亦不應向美抗議而應向阻止彼等與歐洲復興計劃合作之國抗議。至於就四强咨詢機關不獲充分利用之事而提出抗議，亦應向造成德國及歐洲現狀之佔領强國提出。渦去三年中，四强就德國問題從事協商，曾一無成就，蘇聯否決其他三强已同意之決議共達六十九次之多。波蘭指美國企圖分裂德國，實　無根據。美國建議之歐洲復興計劃未被若干國家接受，當然不能使復興計劃惠及此等國家。美國政府對於目前德國之分裂狀態，亦至爲不悅，西方國家之擬具西德共同計劃，原非其本意所在。美國之照會並否認倫敦會議未充分顧及安全問題之點，指出倫敦會議關於魯爾及一般安全之建議，已特別規定不使德國重建其經濟力量以供未來侵略之用之保證。</p>
<h3>東西展開外交戰　柏林空運創高峯　索帥將偕布爾加寧返國一行</h3>

<p>〔路透社柏林八日電〕東西之外交戰愈呈緊張聲中，柏林空運七日創最高峯，美英法三國飛機輸送二千噸物資來柏林，包括糧食，煤，藥材及莫他重要供應。美國空中霸王機已將首批空運煤斤二百噸運抵柏林西區，英美並計劃使用轟炸機放裝之運輸機，向一九三六年之奧林匹克運動會塲，大量自機上之投彈孔中投下煤斤，估計每日如能出動二百架，即可維持配給量减少後之供電量。在外交戰方面，自英美法直接向莫斯科提出抗議要求解除對柏林之封鎖後，柏林正以極緊張之心情靜待蘇方之反應。蘇聯方面於過去廿四小時中，亦已接連向西方盟國提出三次抗議，一爲抗議美國之片面變更柏林之空軍交通規則，一爲抗議西方佔領區當局之阻斷西總對東德之貿易，一爲抗議英國桑德蘭式飛船之遝糧降落柏林美軍區內之哈凡爾湖。蘇當局向美國抗議其片面變更空中交通規則之時，並提出警吿，揚言如果四强協議之空中交通規則不獲被遵守，則西德與柏林間通過空中走廊之航空交通，將不再由蘇聯保障其安全。</p>

<p>今晨一時四十分，趙局長決定親蒞福利組門口，擬用擴聲器對全體工人訓話，詎全體拒絕聆聽，紛紛退入福利組大禮堂中。趙局長乃由警局兪局長等陪同入內，向全體宣佈：（一）十八屆售票員及廿一屆司機每人各發兩個月薪，並照付至七日止之獎金，願返鄕者今日即可領取，兩月內希自覓職業，待公司情况好轉，仍可允許復職。（二）諸位全憑一時衝動，搗毀物件，復劫持公司方面洽談人員，不顧後果，實屬破壞紀律，要知今後不做事猶可，不做人絕對不可。（三）公司各綫交通，大衆需要迫切，諸位以停駛要挾，直與市民大衆爲難，公司三年來苦心孤詣留與市民之榮譽印象，諸位不應一手破壞。趙氏復痛陳渠在浙十年培養電信技工數萬，均能蔚爲國用，而在滬三年來訓練大批交通人材，竟造成今日事件，深感痛心。末命在塲人員分別舉手計數，廿一屆司機僅餘四十人，十八屆售票亦僅餘五十人，趙氏聲明決守諾言，請渠等早回高昌廟或家中休息。此時突有一一六一售票員沈漢石登台趨前與趙局長握手，痛哭流涕，自道身世，謂渠之痛苦，實超過當局之估計，戔戔兩月薪金，有何用處？且覓職不易，家屬留滬何以爲生？經趙局長調查沈係因二日夜不眠不食，且恐懼失業，昨晚九時曾於福利會樓上躍下企圖自殺，幸樓不甚高，一度昏迷，後幸復甦。當命單獨處理，但全體仍擾攘不休，直至三時左右，趙局長因顧及今日急需復工，乃願作讓步，囑全體老同事於四日內簽名送呈公司當局，公司可老慮將渠等每月兩天汁工，津貼十八屆及廿一屆售票司機使復職。於是遷延兩日之糾紛，終得吿一段落。工人紛紛離去，趙局長等亦即歸寓。</p>

<h3>開封一陣狂風暴雨　來也匆匆云也匆匆　劉茂恩說：要在廢墟中爭生存</h3>
<p>〔本報開封一日航訊〕匪侵入開封後，滿街都是標語傳單，充滿了「解放開封」等字樣，它究竟「解放」了一些什麼？這裏有一筆簡帳：</p>
<p>（一）澈底破壞普臨電廠和福豫麵粉廠的機件，掠劫省圖書館，博物館，河南大學所藏的書籍儀　標本無數</p>
<p>（二）十八日在城垣南郊漢家營集體檢殺保安團官兵三百餘人。</p>
<p>還有一件最使人驚心觸目的是：國軍五千壯士的被屠。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：匪攻陷開封以後，於廿二日黃昏時，將被俘官兵五千餘人，編隊押至開封西北黃河渡口，先呌被俘的人們休息飲水，等到大家在黃河灘上蹲下去時，預先布置好的幾十挺重機槍」齊掃射，結東了我五千壯士的生命，發洩了它們的獸慾。共一匪很巧妙，他躲在黃河灘頭幹集體屠殺的勾當，可是他料不到竟有一個虎口餘生的六十六師砲兵營的排長黃正，僥倖地逃了出來，宣布出這慘無人道的事實。當邱淸泉軍長吿訴我這個事實之後，他欣喜非常，他說：我得到這個消息，比我聽到我的部隊殲滅了十萬敵人還要高興些。基於這一點，我可以確信共匪是不難消滅的了！據說，共匪於槍殺之後，把五千多個屍體，拋向黃河之中，這也許就是所謂「掩屍滅迹」，可是人民的仇恨，是不是也會隨着黃河的滾滾流水而消逝呢？</p>
<p>當開封危急之時，東·西·南三路援軍，計由鄭州東進之郭旅，被匪陳賡部之第九縱隊攔去於中牟，由豫南北進之胡璉兵團，爲劉伯誠部阻礙於上蔡以北的地區，最有力而最有希望的邱淸泉兵國十八日自魯西金鄕附近西下，迢迢五百里，漫漫七八天，兩年來轉戰於魯蘇豫皖一帶的「火牛軍」，一路上擊潰了陳匪一·四·六縱隊　輪　阻擊，終於廿六日攻克開封。</p>
<p>廿五日，記者在邱兵團司令部中，聽到劉茂恩主席已經脫險，居留於八十三師師部的消息，遂和整五師態副師長笑三趨車往訪。次日，午後四時，開封收復，記者復隨劉主席和脫險而巧遇主席的省新聞處處長周烈範及河南省立商專王校長於七時五十分進入開封。</p>
<p>古城斜日，風沙漫天，城之四郊，新　纍纍，餓犬三四，蹀　其　，氣氛慘肅，這是戰爭！</p>
<p>我們的汽車，在掃雷器的步步試探之下，開進汴城。劉茂恩主席站在打開蓬的吉普軍上，向着市民揮手，千萬個民衆，情不自禁地拍手歡呼，歡迎着收復後只有四小時便進人汴垣的劉主席。</p>
<p>夕暉籠罩着被破壞的相國寺，郵政大樓，省府大厦，女子師範，鐘棋，普臨電廠，……危牆高聳，瓦磚成堆，看着這些頹壁殘垣，劉主席頻頻地對着記者嘆氣。</p>
<p>在省府，郵政大樓兩處的瓦礫堆中，好幾處還　着烟，街道上也充　着有淡有濃的焦味。這種焦味，刺激到人們的心，在此時此地，每個人都會想到：滿目瘡痍，何日方能恢復？</p>
<p>電廠被燒毀，電綫被破壞，大街旁的電綫　，東倒西歪地橫在地上，電燈是沒有了，黑暗的馬路上，只剩着軍車上的燈在照耀。請千萬別漠視這微微的光，還正是開封五十萬民衆四天來所希冀的一點光明！</p>
<p>劉主席返汴的當夜，和省府幾位脫險的要員如馬秘書長陵甫，敎廳王　長公度，新聞處周處長烈範，省銀行楊總經理憲生等，籌劃安撫民衆，恢復秩序等措施，第二天，省府的安民布告，張貼在街頭巷尾，由瑯州車運來的洛陽撤出的一批警察，抵達汴垣，即刻執行工作。大軍雲集在開封，各將領在會商着保衛汴垣的計劃第五軍的政工人員，辦理着救濟民衆，診療民衆的工作，官傳車不停地在各個大街道上飛跑，民衆自動地張貼着標語：「歡迎劉主席」。「歡迎邱軍長」，「歡迎第五軍」，……很明顯地，民衆在飽受赤色的恐怖之餘，又開始企望着在政府的懷抱中獲取一點溫暖了。</p>
<p>整六十六師師長李仲辛將軍的下落，到廿七日的早晨，還是一個謎，自殺吧，找不着　體。被俘吧，在共匪的廣播中，只提到師部游參謀長和十三旅張旅長，沒提到他的名字。突圍吧，似乎在事實上沒有可能，即使可能，三數天來，爲什麼始終沒有消息？記者於二十七日晨，趨車赴李師長指揮所所在地的龍亭一看。龍亭是北宋時大內舊址，在這次戰事中，是最後陷落的一個據點，記者忍着屍臭，巡行一周，（不如說憑弔）有折足斷臂，蜷伏於磚塊瓦片之旁，或浸沒在水池中的屍體，有被匪燒壞的二十餘輛汽車的軀壳，有不能使用的大砲，有沒有爆炸的手榴彈，砲彈，還有士兵丟下來的帽子，鞋子，襪子，……。</p>
<p>我再爬上北城垣上的一座調堡附近，碰到了兩位軍官，他們一位是六十六師師長的侍從副官譚世英，還有一位是該師特務營的劉排長，他們是來找李師長的忠骸的，相談之下，記者於無意中證實了李師長自戕成仁的消息。據他們兩位說：在廿一日晚間，匪突入北關，南北兩路，集中火力向龍亭猛撲，這時李師長在龍亭左腿已負重傷，龍卒的局面又很危殆。於是譚副官遂掮着李氏自龍亭右側，跑到城北的這座碉堡中，時爲儿時十分。將軍的英勇，轉移不了局勢的惡化，眼看着共匪漸漸地迫近碉堡了，李仲辛將軍回天乏術，本着革命軍人的傳統精神，於九時十五分，拿着自己佩用的一柄轉輪手槍，對準右總，一槍畢命。鮮血噴處，在戡亂史上寫下了鮮明燦爛的一頁！</p>
<p>這位譚副官當時在側，旋因協助作戰未及掩塊，等到他負傷被俘，復行逃出來看時，李將軍忠骸已經不見，他只檢到一枚符號，和一根李將軍生前的束腰帶而已。</p>
<p>他指着地下的一　血跡和一大堆頭髮說，這就是李將軍最後能給人看到的遺跡了。說着，他把血土和亂髮臨時掩埋到地下，我俯首注視，黃沙一坵，祝將軍永恒地安息！</p>
<p>像一陣暴風的一樣，來得快，去得也快，開封從狂颫惡浪中復歸於寗靜了。商店開業，公敎機關復員，衛道上行人也多起來了……劉茂恩主席於收復開封之夜，與記者秉燭長談，他說：收復以後救濟第一。省垣決不他遷。我們要在廢墟中求生存。當記者於二十七日午案乘軍機飛鄭時，於汴垣上空，看到在日光下滿城飄揚着鮮明的國旗，意識到明日的開封，將必在艱苦中走向新生之路！</p>

<h3>福州水國圖</h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>〔福州訊〕福州人每年總担心着五月十三日「關帝磨刀水」的降臨，在那一天，總不免要漲點水上陸，這次却在早兩天（六月十七日）晚十時水便上岸了。十八日黎明，瘋狂的濁浪，便佔有了整個市區。過去從來不漲水的，這次也漲了，台江區的三保·尙書廟·大廟街，義洲·戶部前·文藻山，倉山區的龍　角·萬蒲墩·舍人廟·大根區的二橋亭·金斗橋·南門兜·以及鼓樓區的洪山橋街；這些低　之地，水位都在一丈三尺以上，義州和尙書廟一帶，水位甚至高出二丈以上。就是省府路·東街口一帶，也是三四尺以上的狂濤</p>
<p>南斗宮前瞭望市區</p>
<p>爲了明瞭整個市區的水勢，記者特地冒雨爬上于山頂的南斗宮前，站在全山的最高處，展望整個市區以及眼界所及的林森縣界。「山高天下小」，在人們眼界擴大之餘，往往可以讓心曠神怡，胸懷豁達，可是在這空前的災厄之下，越是眼界擴大了，記者的心却越沉重了。從極西的義洲·洪山橋·西南的三縣洲，極南的上渡路，極東的鴨牳洲·康山，除了極北的屏山之外，全被浸在滾滾黃流之中，到處是一片汪洋，濁浪滔天。無法發現一座完整的房屋，只有那無數的屋頂和樹梢，飄浮在狂瀾裏面。他們戰慄着，浮動着，隨時都有被整個吞噬的危險。沿着閩江一越展望到魁岐馬江去，這幅悽慘萬狀的水國岡，一直被延長伸展着。</p>
<p>大水齊腹　訊問災民</p>
<p>記者冒着齊腹的大水，去訪問災區。不過，在這滾滾狂流之中，靠着涉水的力量所能走到的，的確是太有限了，街上雖然來來往往的有不少小艇和木筏，可是大部份是被人以高價包用的，他們包括了閑遊和搶救災民，閑遊的自然不許「閑人」涉足，搶救災民的，又不能讓記者去增加　的載量代而减少災黎脫險的機會。</p>
<p>記者所經過的地方，有數不淸的難民以絕望的眼光在等待最後的援救。他們多數困苦地擠在擱樓之上，從窗縫裏露出飢餓恐怖的苦臉，企望別人施與一瓢濟饑的稀粥，或者一隻救助的手。但是他們又怕木筏或者小船攏去，不斷地向來者發出近乎兇暴的警吿，因爲那些己經浮動的房子，只要稍爲浪動的一衝撞，馬上便會全歸於盡。</p>
<p>能躱在擱樓上的己經是幸福的了，大多數人是沒擱樓可以安身，半夜裏突然進了水，逃旣逃不出，如何逃避這空前的鉅厄，在他們的生命史裏又沒有任何經驗，只好臨時弄點門板之類，紮成木筏，讓全家浮在水面上，戰戰競競地整日不敢動一動，長夜不敢有片刻的睡眠。</p>
<p>壓死溺斃　千人以上</p>
<p>市區裏從孫老營，善化坊，城邊曹，大中寺，達明路這一帶，只要是泥牆房子，幾乎沒一座是完整的，到處是瓦礫一片；木房子則多只空留一個軀殼。省政府的圍牆，朝南和朝西倒了兩大段，社會處，財政廳，敎育廳民政廳都有一部份坍塌。</p>
<p>衣錦坊十室九垮，楊監察使的洋房子外圍牆全倒了；這邊水退了無數災民，都拼命在挖掘殘餘，搬移所有殘剩的傢私箱篋。文儒坊的情形更慘，那兒多數是大房子，可是大房子的坍塌更兇，七十號九門提督甘國寳後裔海軍艦長甘聯勸的家，姪媳姪女等一家十五口，要不是隔鄰幾十名學生的援助，救出九口來，便將要全家覆亡，可是壓在裏面的三女一男和兩孩子，挖出來的屍首却才三具呢？光祿坊，倉前街一帶，十室十垮，沒有一家獲得保全的，他們之間只有坍塌程度的輕重，並沒有倖免的人。茶亭路的情况，簡直呌人不忍卒睹，那兒從一百四十一號至一百八十一號木房子以及南市小學，茶亭洗馬斗南救火會，全都只有一個空壳子，什麼也漂淨了。電桿子滿地橫陳，幾座橋全陷了。虎節路的情况一塌糊塗，安泰橋，吉庇巷，桂枝里，朱紫坊，道山路，南門兜，中洲，上渡，龍潭角，義洲，尙書廟戶部前，文藻山……說不淸的災區，多數門面都還完整，裏面却全無立錐之地。下杭路雖然坍塌不多，可是這福州的金庫·糖·肥田粉·洋灰·多數入了水，其他商貨或者還可以保留一點本錢，而這些却完全損壞了。據一般估計，倒塌房屋數以萬計，慘遭壓死溺斃的人起碼在一千以上，被災的人民達二十萬人以上，財產物資的損失，可能達四五十萬億以上。這一個空前巨災下的福州，何時才能讓她恢復過來呢？</p>

<h3>食米售價昨又挺升</h3>
<p>市場上中粳米幾告絕絕跡</p>
<p>昨日食米市塲交易，因受二千萬之限價關係，上中粳米幾吿絕跡。僅有最宿次之早稻，按限價成交。碾秈亦高達二千萬，上白粳塲外價二千二百萬，中等二千一百五十萬，高薄稻及羊秈一致開二千二百萬，早稻二千〇五十萬，各較上日挺升一百萬元。陰元白元中貨各做二千萬，市塲登記到貨南北共計四千七百八十石。</p>
<p>麺粉　昨由廠商配售本街實銷各牌粉，價格六百二十萬，每戶二十九包，共計配出七千五百六十包，惟尙嫌供不應求。一方因小麥價格高昂，外埠粉價均漲，是以人心堅昂，塲外價格再升。老車七百二十萬，兵船七百萬，各升五六十萬元。麩皮挺十五萬，小麥五百五十萬。</p>
<p>雜糧　一致再漲，黃豆到存俱稀，且成本高昂，續挺一百萬元。漢口乍豆以一千一百萬成交，較限價高百萬。菉豆本街去化甚佳，高貨砌高百萬。蠶豆挺四五十萬，苞米新陳不接，供少猛漲。啓東苞米挺四百萬元，紅糧開價甚高，明光紅糧一千零五十萬，芝蔴再加二百萬。生仁南銷見呆，獨低一百萬元。</p>
<p>食油　原料缺乏，黃豆價昂，市勢挺升，各油廠以四千五百萬之價盡量供應豆油，中植廠及大生廠等盡量按四千三百萬開生菜油，均高達限價。生油亦以六千萬限價成交，各升一百至二百萬元不等。小車蔴油漲二百萬，爲六千零一百五十萬收市，豆餅初開四百八十萬，後以少受主，退至四百七十萬，與昨平。</p>
<h3>茶市交易平淡</h3>
<p>紅綠茶昨執主雖欲居奇，但內銷花色，終因本街與鄕莊帮出價慳吝，致交易未趨活潑。至於外銷茶，出口商亦在整理連日辦就之貨，俾資趕裝本月十八日駛菲之船期，是以均無意急於採納。故市况迂迴微堅，比前無大軒輊</p>
<h3>川省請購陜棉</h3>
<p>綏署電陝西省政府　請發渝紗廠採購證</p>
<p>〔本報重慶八日電〕綏署八日電陝省府，在新棉上市前，准發渝紗廠採購證，購陝棉一萬八千担。計沙市九千担，申新裕華各二七〇〇担，豫豐四五〇〇担。又在未得陝府復電前，渝市存棉及中紡公司棉花，一律禁止川口，由各廠照市價收購。</p>
<h3>橡膠同業公會要求　限制橡膠成品輸入</h3>
<p>本市橡膠製品工業同業公會，鑒於當局對橡膠製成品之輸入，限制太寬，輸出入管理委員會之每季限額中，橡膠業所得外匯，百分之四十均爲成品，而眞正橡膠原料，僅及百分之六十。此項現象，不特對橡膠業之發展爲一大打擊，即對政府外匯之運川，亦屬一種重大浪費。過去曾一再列舉事實，請求政府改變現行方針，均無具體結果。該業邇來因有鑒於庫存外匯日見短絀，而各同業所需原料孔急，爰再列舉利弊，呈請輸出入管理委員會，請求除國內尙無出產之飛機及小型汽車輪胎外，其餘製成品，自第六季輸入限額起，一律禁止輸入。將過去用於成品輸入之外匯，改購原料，以維各廠生產，而節外匯支開云。</p>

<p>又訊：紡建公司標售十二磅五福細布，四君子元嗶嘰府綢，如意漂布，跳鯉電光斜等計有十二種68×86彩花被單一種，聞五福細布布商塡價申請者，約在二千四百萬至四百二十萬元，四君子元嗶嘰塡價在二千六百萬至六百二十萬元，以染廠申請獨多。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會頃爲漢口原棉可供收購，數量尙巨，同時顧及漢口棉商收購大量原棉資金週轉之靈活起見，經上次委員會議決議，以一個月爲期，准由各委託收花棉商憑運花提單向本會領取八成貸款，該會昨已致電漢口棉商承購棉花聯營處知照云。</p>

<p>（一）校史</p>
<p>交大成立於淸光緒二十二年，迄今已有五十餘年之歷史。初創時名南洋公學，下分四院：（一）師範學院，（二）外院（即附屬小學），（三）中院（即中學），（四）上院（即高等預科）。經費取給於招商及電報兩局之特捐。民國後直隸交通部，先後改稱南洋大學，及交通部上海工業專門學校：民國十年改組稱交通大學，分設土木工程，機械工程，電機工程，管理及科學諸學院；二十六年舊敎育部，直轄三程學院，合併爲工學院，科學院改稱理學院，管理學院仍舊。二十九年在渝設立分校。其後滬西淪陷，該校本部遷渝，分校改稱總校；至三十五年復員完成，始恢復舊觀。</p>
<p>（二）概況</p>

<h3>我世運足球隊　臨別精彩表演　四比三擊敗新加坡隊</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新加坡七日電〕中國世運足球隊今夜在此作赴英前最後一次比賽，以四比三力克新加坡隊。中國隊上月曾以零比一受挫於該隊，此次爲　前恥，格外用力，上半時球技表演，水準甚高，下半時平平。開球後中國五鋒疾進，中鋒朱永强與右內鋒鄒文治尤爲神出鬼沒。新隊防綫不固，難以抵擋，中國隊兩翼何應芬與李大輝穿過敵陣，一再射門，新隊守門艾根，頗爲沉着，用搶救方法化險爲夷。八分鐘時，新隊乘中國隊後方空虛，實行偸襲，新隊邊鋒霍蒙得中鋒彭松傳球，頂進一球，疾如閃電。兩分鐘後，朱永强乘新隊左全衛蕯勒勃失守，回敬一球，扳成平手。十七分鐘時，中國隊左內鋒郭英祺叩門，球觸橫木彈出，朱永强一躍而前，頭頂一球，應聲入網。中後全是中國隊天下，但新隊又實行偷襲，新隊右翼馬舟穿過中國隊右全衛侯榕生，着地打門，一蹴而進，中國守門張邦綸，挽救無術。數分鐘後，中國隊員在罰球區域犯規，被罰廿五碼任意球，新隊左翼邱希主踢，脚起進網，新隊以三對二佔先。未幾朱永强單騎直入，近門射進一球，上半時爲三對三。下半時易地再戰，精采不多，中國隊右冀何應芬傳中郭英祺，英祺一頂入網，結果以四對三獲勝。</p>

<h3>澳洲三女傑　世運有希望　跳欄·短跑·跳遠</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦通訊〕澳洲出席倫敦本屆世運曾的三十五位選手中，有三位是女選手，她們是雪萊·史蒂里克蘭（西澳），喬伊斯·金（新南威爾斯），和裘迪絲·康黛（雪梨）。</p>
<p>史蒂里克蘭是高個子，黃頭髮，漂亮的風度，澳洲人把她看作世運會中很有希望的一個選手，在今年一月澳洲運動會中，她的百碼跳欄賽，相等於十一·六秒的世界紀錄。那次比賽是在草地上跑的，她的同鄉都認爲她在世運會塲的煤屑跑道上跑起來，一定會更好的，甚至可以表現得和八十米跳欄賽的瑪琳·茄狄納（英），和布蘭克斯柯恩夫人（荷蘭）一樣的出色。</p>
<p>史蒂里克蘭小姐今年廿四歲，是一個大學的數學系講師，她在西澳大學唸一年級的時候，第一次參加了體育比賽，在那個時候，她幾乎贏得了一年級女生的每一種比賽項目，由於她和男選手一同受訓練的結果，在每種項目的時間和距離上，都有了改進。</p>
<p>去年澳洲舉行全國蓮動會時，她獲得了五種冠軍，今年的運動曾中，她贏得跳欄賽的錦標，在兩種短跑決賽中，她僅亞於喬伊斯金。史蒂里克小姐曾受到她父親的敎導，她的父親戴夫史蒂里克蘭，曾經被稱爲西澳有名的短跑選手。</p>
<p>喬伊斯金是一個二十七歲的學校敎師，她以十一秒贏得了全澳一百碼錦標，因爲那時她在剛下過雨的草地上跑的，這次參加世運會，成績一定可以有進步。她參加二百二十碼，以二十四。九秒創立澳洲新紀錄。</p>
<p>裘　絲·康黛·是一個女學生，她以十八呎五吋贏得了全澳女子跳遠冠軍，她今年十六歲，身高五呎六吋，是今後澳洲著名女選手之一。</p>

<p>實力透視</p>
<p>領隊人選刻下尙未正式派定，其原因係戰時屢建奇功之戰鬬機駕駛員芬萊，腿部肌肉受傷，如彼能及時恢復，即將委彼擔任。渠仍爲全世界最速之高欄健將，一九三二年度世運會中參加一百十米決賽，曾獲殿軍，四年後在柏林舉行世運會時，則躍爲亞軍矣。如屆時芬萊之腿傷，未能痊愈，則極可能由勞勃茨擔任領隊，勞氏爲英國參加四百米之選手。英國短跑紀錄盟主培萊，僅參加一百米賽，或將引起一般人士之驚異，蓋彼於夏間因腿傷中止練習，乃寗擇最擅長之一項。最近數週來渠頗有進展。麥考果代爾現年二十二歲，爲一出色之短跑選手，渠在一百米與一一百米賽中，可操左券。巴立德爲二十三歲之倫敦一藝術學校學生，亦可能被列入世界優勝者之林。哈勒斯爲紐西蘭紀錄盟主，爲全世界半哩賽之健將。南紀維利則爲一千五百米之勁敵，如芬萊得以康復，其一百十米跳欄決賽，必佔人之先。勃里爾年僅十八，爲參加一百十米跳欄之英國選手，曾以十五·一秒獲勝，渠仍在求學之中，爲英國最年輕之選手。邱恰爾參加一萬米競走，在最近數週練習中曾打破世界紀錄。跳高選手巴彼遜所保持之紀錄爲六呎二吋，撑竿跳選手韋勃斯特，於上屆柏林世運會中居於第六，渠可保持十三呎六吋之紀錄。何爾亭爲馬拉松長跑選手，爲英國男子組中希望最大之一人。擲鐵鎚選手克拉克，亦爲出色之人物。女子組中最臻優良之人物爲一百米之約丹夫人，二百米之琪司曼小姐，參加八十米跳欄賽之茄狄納小姐，最近曾以十一·二秒創立世界新紀錄，泰勒夫人於上屆世運會中，參加跳高，曾獲亞軍。</p>

<h3>胡樸安先生周年祭</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>胡樸安先生逝世於去年七月九日晨三時三十五分，至今日爲一周年，緬懷舊交，不能無一言。</p>
<p>余與樸安交二十年，平時不常相見；晤談最多爲其逝世前一年，及民廿二至廿四在正風文學院（現改爲誠明文學院）敎書之時。今即以此兩時期言之。</p>
<p>民國廿二年，余到正風文學院講西洋史，樸安亦任該院敎務長，同時更在持志學院及暨南大學敎書，代步僅一包車，終日奔馳（持志在江灣，暨大在眞茹），以任江蘇民政廳長兩年之人，至非敎書不能生活，其人格亦可見矣。在此時期，余以常相接談，得微窺其學問所在。其治學之方法，先建設本身之學問，以爲任事之基礎。以文字爲應用之工具，以讀書爲做人之根本。以顧亭林，黃黎洲，王船山，顏習齋四先生之學說爲中心。入手的方法，則頗受戴東原，段王裁學說之影饗。據樸安言，彼不情願做一考據家的學者，但是讀中國書，不能不由考據入手，所以在顧黃王顏四先生外，又加了戴段二先生爲治學的標準。讀了戴段之書後，始曉考據的工具在於訓詁，訓詁之基本在於聲韻。其讀書做人之範圍，大概如是。</p>
<p>前年（民卅五年）七月學校放暑假後，樸安忽來一信，欲我入市通志館（現改爲上海市文獻委員會）工作，余雖有接受之意，遲遲未去，樸安又來信促之，並約一日期，陪我到館，其待友之眞誠，有非常人所能及者。我於卅五年八月一日到館，（今年三月離去，共在館一年零七個月。）在休息時間，得與樸安常常接談。午飯時，見其僅吃香蕪數枚，或麵包數片，我言所吃太少，營養不足，恐與身體有虧。樸安言：「自日本發動太平洋戰爭，知糧食必成問題，即將飯量漸漸减少，到現在，每頓只吃飯一小碗，靑菜少許，所食雖减，而每日看書寫文，精神如故。」又言：「近來睡時，即在椅上假寐，不上床，天不亮即起，寫文一千餘字，看書若干頁，始到館。」於此可見樸安是一强毅的人，能以精神戰勝物質。</p>
<p>樸安兼任法政學院國文甲組課，逝世前兩月，肝病漸深，要我爲代課，辭之不得，即講解其所著「歷代文章論略」，講義上所舉「三祖」「七子」「正始」「燕許」等等，病中尙在旁爲注明其出處，余在法政學院代課兩星期，至學期考試時爲止。樸安敎書數十年，不意余爲結東其最後課程，此又令人不能忘者也。</p>
<p>樸安於民廿八年四月猝得腦溢血症，雖醫治有效，左手左足從此不能活動，〔編者按：前年葉楚傖先生病逝上海，余曾於殯儀館晤樸安先生，是時已能緩步行走，然於瞻視靈堂布置時，偶一不愼，搖搖幾仆，余急趨前扶持，至廳旁休息，先生乃黯然默坐，而老淚盈眶矣。此景此情，如在目前，而先生亦已作古人！讀飴先先生文至此，眞不禁感慨係之。」每日仍讀書不輟，右手可以寫字，在病廢數年間，寫成「周易古史觀」數種創作，逝世之年，又寫「霄年之路」小册子，學生得之，皆奉爲至寳。余去年七月有輓樸安一聯，自謂尙爲眞知其爲人者，茲錄於後，即以之結束此文。</p>
<p>「早志澄淸，長才未展，宦歸仍是寒儒，即今晚節彌貞，落落高風箴薄俗。</p>
<p>惟于狷介，與世多遺，公逝更誰知己，豈獨人師難得，莘莘學子失瞻依。」</p>
<h3>題余摹歸竹圖</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>墨竹圖爲歸莊（元恭）先生繪贈路安卿者，風怒雨泣，各極其態。時明社已屋，先生自太湖返棹，作於吳興之古寺中，有自跋甚詳。跋盡附錄祭忠詩九首，係弔劉念台，祁佳彪，暨先忠愍（諱邦曜）諸公者。卷末更有顧亭林哭元恭五言四章，語多觸忌，故爲原刋本所未收。龍游余越園氏曾慕製一輻，遺賀揚靈先生，由僕題句留念。今者荒雲月落，人琴俱香，思之餘痛塞胸！</p>
<p>頭上紅燈注六韜，江山手障白雲高，但能一節關忠愛，紙墨通靈夢亦勞。</p>
<p>此竹如人骨幹淸，雖然不語抱癡情，後三百年誰爲友？剩箇詩髯踏月行。</p>
<p>白髮春燈硯海深，冰花摹出値千金，一奇眞比史全部，中有孤儒耿耿心。</p>
<p>曾題淮浦一篷霜，又抱溪藤入夢長，我吐淸哀當麥飯，不須風露拜歸莊。</p>
<p>不盡江頭莾蒼吟，更圖萬竹吐哀音，書生痴憤吾能識，偸息人間看陸沉。</p>
<p>爛醉無聲墨淚滋，判餘　首祭忠詩，前朝今代難分說，披髮問天又一時。</p>
<p>疊疊波含「萬古愁」，（元恭所譜散曲名）朱家賸水路家樓，無能一夜長千尺，截作洞簫吹上頭。</p>
<p>或賈或僧或酒徒，英雄一一老江湖，誰先死郤靑天葬，但看無根墨竹圖。</p>
<p>湖波凄咽夕陽殷，剩弔遺民草莽間，我是亭林應痛哭，恨無義轍出崑山。</p>
<p>往事分明絕可傷，詩文眞不補危亡，高天短笠橫刀死，終勝太湖醉一塲。</p>
<h3>玄武湖上的音樂會</h3>
<p>— 喬龍</p>
<p>炎夏又臨，可是今年上海的市政府交響樂隊，却還沒有舉行夏夜週末室外音樂會的消息。</p>
<p>上星期去南京，適逢週末，應友人邀，聆聽了一次首都中華交響樂隊夏季週末在玄武湖上翠洲露天音樂廳舉行的演奏會，情緒相當好。</p>
<p>南京在還都後，隨着從重慶歸來的，共有兩個交響樂隊。一個是屬於勵志社的，大都爲外賓演奏；一個是由林聲翕氏領導指揮的中華交響樂隊。當時南京在中山陵旁雖有一個建築很宏麗的露天音樂台，可是路程究竟太遠，並且夏季的露天音樂會又都在晚上，所以對於交通問題很雌解決，不能作經常演奏。</p>
<p>在勝利後的第二年，經過市府等有關方面商討的結果，認爲玄武湖上的翠洲很合理想：離市區不遠，而又無車馬的雜聲，不過要建室內的音樂廳，經費還是沒有着落，退而求其次，就興建了現在演奏用的露天樂台。</p>
<p>台的式樣和上海兆豐公園內的差不多，不過那裏的比較寬大，可容納六十人以上的交響樂隊，燈光配備亦合理想，台作半球形，矗立在地上，背面用鉛片鋪滿，映日生光，在夕陽西下時，給玄武湖添上了不少的光輝。</p>
<p>本年的夏季星期露天音樂會，還是音樂台落成後的首次演出。預定節目共八週，從五月廿三日起到七月十一日止，天雨順延；不過不巧得很，開始就連着逢到了二個雨中週末，所以無形中已延遲了二星期。票價每場三萬元，眞是太便宜了。</p>
<p>音樂的內容方面，質和量都很重，每次從午後七時三刻起要到九時半左右才能演奏完畢。第一週計有貝多芬的英雄交響曲，修貝特的羅薩孟特前奏曲，海頓的舞曲等。</p>
<p>中華交響樂隊成立在抗戰時的陪都，全隊以弦樂器人才較佳，管樂器較次，這是沒奈何的事。</p>
<p>每個週末午後，盪舟在玄武湖上（那裏的船特別便宜，每二小時只要十萬元左右，七時左右買了票去坐臥在音樂台前的草地上，（那裏沒有椅子，隨票發蓆墊一個。）音樂會開始時，夕陽猶未下山，這時一抹殘霞，映紅天際，城頭，和湖上。看晚鳥歸林，暑氣漸消，眞是一幅湖濱消夏圖。音樂會完畢時，有月亮的時候，在月光中覓條小船，盪回城去；沒有月光的日子，踏着翠虹堤上的微弱燈光，漫步歸家，眞是都市中理想的週末消遣了。苓雨</p>
<h3>名人怪癖</h3>
<p>— 薟雨</p>
<p>英國學者約翰生博十爲英文字典的鼻祖，負一代人望。但是他反對用茶匙。無論手指多髒，他總是用手來攪溶檸檬茶內的糖。</p>
<p>美國大文豪霍桑在學生時代，故意將書法寫得奇草，以期「像作家模樣」。他死後，有若干遺稿因爲無人能讀，歷多年猶不克印行。</p>
<p>法學家霍爾　斯有許多奇癖，其一是寫信要立着寫。有人問他爲什麼不坐下來寫，他說坐着寫信會寫得太長。</p>
<h3>生活指數</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>時代讓人們多懂了好些經濟學的常識。比如說生活指數吧，勝利以前，多數人都覺得這個「新名詞」很陌生，而今則家喩戶曉，賣報童子也能熟誦了。報載黃浦江的搖划子的船夫，也已經照生活指數調整待遇。</p>
<p>苦難的時代帶來了「指數問題」，指數愈被重視，愈成問題的時候，也就是經濟愈走下坡，</p>
<p>指數在今日中國，有一個特點：只肯向上，不甘落後。「指數」，事實上該改稱爲「物價上漲數」了。</p>
<p>在上海，指數有兩點妙處：</p>
<p>第一，指數明明由物價而來，但是商人們却根據指數改碼子。天下間，事之不通，莫逾乎此</p>
<p>第二，指數的編製明明有一定的公式及方法，答數只有一個，但是事實上却可以開會商量，討價還價事之滑稽，也莫甚於此！</p>
<h3>長頸鹿</h3>
<p>— 何島</p>
<p>在歐美的馬戲班或動物院中，長頸鹿是最受歡迎的動物之一，可惜我們的動物園中竟沒有長頸鹿。</p>
<p>長頸鹿的性格極溫和馴良，有時竟會給貓咬傷，但是，在他發怒的時候牠也能一脚踢死一雙雄獅。</p>
<p>豢養長頸鹿的人們多歡喜收養稚鹿。長成了的長頸鹿實在太高了（十八英尺），火車裏無法裝運。</p>
<p>長頸鹿的頭頸雖長，却不會發出任何聲音來。而且，牠也能幾個禮拜不喝水，像駱駝一樣。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>赫爾回憶錄述及兩次大戰中間歐洲大局之錯綜關係云：「法國希望德國實力在他之下，對德國軍備接近平等的任何辦法，不能同意；在另一方面，英國不喜歡法國在大陸上佔有一個高踞雄視的地位，更希望歐洲造成一種均勢，而使他自己的實力可以成爲決定的因素，舉足重輕。」此是紀實，不但爲一時期的紀實，且是英國傳統的國策之紀實。老英此種國策，定於亨利八世之第一謀臣華爾賽，鑒於已往對歐陸武力經營之失敗，因而堅持不戰而維均勢之信念，以此爲最經濟的自衛之方策，在地理上在歷史上都有相當的理由。英國是大陸以外的島國，四面皆海，海權發達，海軍優越，水路交通無遠弗屆，全球各洲屬地，遍樹「米」字國旗，足以稱覇世界，並無分占歐陸之必要，亦無此可能。但歐陸若歸一國獨覇，則依傍海邊之三島，實感受莫大之威脅。</p>
<p>就歷史地理言，歐洲之大陸國，總以法蘭西爲主體，與英亦爲最近。十四世紀之百年戰爭，十九世紀之拿破崙戰爭，英本土屢瀕於危，早有兩虎相爭兩大不並之史實。德與法亦是世仇，而自大戰拿皇之後，高唱軍國主義的威廉又大做其世界的帝國之迷夢，大興海軍，經營海上勢力，與「海王」之英爭覇，八面樹敵，一味黷武，遂有第一次之歐戰。英法處於相同利害之情境，共同抗德，各協約國一致努力，打倒威廉帝國。德旣俯首矣，法國忽又大昻其頭，克里孟梭，所謂「老虎總理」者，脾睨一切，以戰勝國之主人翁自居，美威爾遜總統之十四信條固屬無效，英相喬治亦爲所壓，中心不平。法之對德條件嚴酷，雖爲防患，而英之於法之獨覇大陸，又不勝其擔心。於是放縱德方，逐步提携，以資宰制，仍是「均勢」的大陸政策之故智。而不料希魔崛起，一味蠻幹，不可理喩，張伯倫雖「不惜任何代價，以求和平」，希特勒却是得步進步，愈賞愈旺。第二次大戰終以暴發。由此觀之，老英之「均勢政策」，「不戰主義」，雖是一副經濟算盤，亦有難得便宜之苦衷。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, August 8th] The Ministry of Finance will continue to adopt a discretionary subsidy method for local finances in provinces and counties in the second half of the year. Before the General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy are finalized, local finances in provinces and counties will continue to be handled according to the current revenue and expenditure system during the transitional period of the second half of the year. If revenue is insufficient, the central government will provide discretionary subsidies, as follows: (1) Budget Deficit Subsidy: A. Based on the key points for budget preparation in provinces and cities, a preliminary review of the budgets of each province and city will be conducted. On the revenue side, estimates should be based on the price trends in the second half of the year, and on the expenditure side, calculations should be based on the proposed plan. All insufficient deficits will be subsidized by the central government based on verified amounts. B. Adjustments to the cost-of-living subsidies in each province and city, in addition to the adjustments made in the first half of the year being included in the budgets of each province and city, adjustments to cost-of-living subsidies in the second half of the year should be specially reviewed and subsidized by the central government. C. For stable provinces and cities that are financially self-sufficient, the central government will no longer provide subsidies. (2) Broadly Raise Funds for Local Self-Defense Forces: A. The original security expenses in the first half of the year will still be listed in the provincial budget for the second half of the year. B. The newly added security expenses in the first half of the year will still be subsidized by the central government in accordance with the approved advance payment in the second half of the year. C. The expenses for the security corps that the Ministry of National Defense plans to add in the second half of this year will still be allocated and subsidized by the central government together with the expenses for the originally added security teams. (3) Subsidies for Pacification Zone Counties and Cities: A. County and City Subsidies: For recovered counties, subsidies will be provided once based on their respective county classifications. B. Tax Exemption Subsidies: Counties and cities that meet the regulations for tax exemption subsidies in pacification zones will continue to receive subsidies on a monthly basis according to the approved plan. For counties and cities that have been occupied but still maintain administrative institutions and self-defense forces, the central government will subsidize them according to established standards after verification.</p>

<h3>Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Shi Zhiquan, Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th] Shi Zhiquan (see photo), the newly appointed Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Ping at 3:30 PM on the 8th. Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, Duanmu Kai, Secretary-General, Xie Guansheng, Minister of Justice Administration (representing Gu Ruhun), Weng Jingtang, Chairman of the Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries, Xia Qin, President of the Supreme Court, and others greeted him at the airport. In response to reporters' inquiries, he said that the date of assuming his duties at the Yuan would be decided after consulting with President Wang. He also stated that the system of Grand Justices in the constitutional draft was initially based entirely on the American system (where Grand Justices manage trials and lawsuits, etc.). After modifications, the content was slightly changed. Grand Justices do not hear cases; their authority lies in interpreting the Constitution and laws. The position of Grand Justices is very important in the judiciary. The Constitution adopts a system of separation of five powers, and the judiciary should be independent. After the implementation of the Constitution, there are even clearer provisions. In the future, he will assist the President and strive to achieve the goal of judicial independence.</p>

<p>Permits for Flour Transportation Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, August 8th] Guan Jiyu, the Minister of Food, attended a press conference at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th to report on the general situation of food administration. Mr. Guan briefly explained two points: the characteristics of China's food problem and the actual situation of food sources, as well as the current food administration measures. Regarding the former, he stated that although China is an agricultural country, the actual amount of food produced is insufficient to meet the needs, and China's foreign trade in food is in deficit. Moreover, due to wars in various regions, there is a lack of coordination between food-deficient areas and food-producing areas, resulting in frequent food shortages. These are all characteristics of China's food problem. Next, Mr. Guan reported on the main current food administration measures one by one. Mr. Guan also explained that the Ministry of Food has suspended the issuance of permits for flour transportation, and those that have already been issued will be invalid after their expiration and will not be extended. Regarding transit transportation, the food distribution committees in the food-needy areas will purchase and transport the food themselves, or entrust the Farmers Bank of China to purchase and transport it on their behalf. Mr. Guan briefly talked about the future direction of food administration, which should focus on three aspects: quantity, price, and quality. In terms of quantity, it is necessary to raise enough real food to enrich the people's food supply and to establish a system of ever-normal granaries to lay the foundation for food security.</p>
<h3>Yanzhou Defends the Famous City; President Allocates 10 Billion for Reward; Railway Between Jinan and Jieshou Has Been Repaired</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, August 8th] Fierce battles continue in the west gate, south gate, and old gate of Yanzhou City.

<h3>Air Force Blockades Yellow River Crossing; Escape Route for Remaining Bandits in the Yellow River Flood Area Has Been Cut Off</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, August 8th] According to Air Force reconnaissance, the remnants of Chen Bandit's various units, which had crossed the Longhai Railway from the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan and were fleeing northeast, had largely reached the area between Caoxian and Kaocheng by the afternoon of the 8th and are continuing to flee north. The National Army's Qiu Qingquan Corps has crossed the Longhai Railway north this afternoon and advanced to the old Kaocheng area, pursuing and annihilating the bandits. The Air Force's Yellow Sea, East Sea, and Bohai Sea air groups have been taking turns flying over western Shandong all day to pursue and annihilate the fleeing bandits. The bandits have been forced to split into countless small groups. The Air Force is adopting a hunting-style attack, and bandit corpses are scattered everywhere. The Air Force is also strictly blockading all Yellow River crossings, cutting off the bandits' escape route. Today, seven bandit boats were bombed and sunk at Gaocun (on the south bank of the Yellow River) northwest of Dongming, and eighteen bandit boats were bombed and sunk at Zhangguantun on the north bank.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, August 8th] In this great victory in eastern Henan, the National Army completely defeated the main forces of the thirteen columns of the Chen and Liu bandits.

<h3>Nanjing Xinmin Daily Newspaper Punished with Suspension for Repeatedly Publishing Content Violating Publication Law</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, August 8th] The Nanjing Xinmin Daily newspaper was permanently suspended from publication on the 8th. According to sources from the Ministry of Interior, the newspaper has repeatedly published content propagandizing for the bandits, spreading rumors, and inciting the people. Recently, it has become even more intensified, falsely reporting facts, slandering the National Army, and hindering the suppression of rebellion. It has seriously violated Articles 21 and 23 of the Publication Law, which state that "publications shall not promote or record anything that harms the interests of the Republic of China or disrupts public order." Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 of the same law, it has been permanently suspended from publication. The Ministry of Interior issued the order at 5:30 PM on the 8th, instructing the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to implement it. The Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Capital Police Department, dispatched personnel to deliver the order to the person in charge of Xinmin Daily at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>Statement by Spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior issued a statement regarding the suspension of the Nanjing Xinmin Daily newspaper, stating that the Nanjing Xinmin Daily has repeatedly published content propagating for the Communist bandits, spreading rumors, inciting the people, and demoralizing the military. It has also frequently carried news reports and opinions that sow discord between the people and local defense forces. Recently, it has become even more intensified, falsely reporting facts, slandering the National Army, and acting as a mouthpiece for the Communists. In order to allow the public to understand the truth and see through the facts, a summary explanation is provided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Propagandizing for the Communist bandits and exaggerating the combat power of the bandit army. The article "Sawdust from the Dabie Mountains" published on June 10th actually promoted that the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's invasion of the Dabie Mountains had resulted in an expansion to 88,000 people. "Rumor that Zuo Yi and Nie Rongzhen are competing" on April 28th also promoted that Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops had expanded from 100,000 to 150,000 people. These are all promotional records that exaggerate the bandit forces and shake people's confidence. "Northeast from Spring to Summer" published on May 27th stated, "Under the principle that supply is more important than combat, over 90 percent of the 13,000 kilometers of railways in Northeast China are controlled by the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army is not only not destroying railways but is also repairing them." The fact that the Communist bandits are destroying railways everywhere, hindering transportation, is well-known to people at home and abroad. The newspaper is actually concealing the crimes of the Communist bandits and promoting the construction in the bandit areas. Who would believe that this is not acting as a mouthpiece for the bandits?</p>
<p>(2) Deliberately spreading rumors and disturbing the hearts of the people. Yichang is a major town between the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Henan. The Communist bandits have never invaded it, let alone besieged it. However, the newspaper claimed on June 26th that "the siege of Yichang has been lifted," a baseless rumor that was clearly intended to falsely report that Yichang was about to be besieged, fabricating facts and shaking the people's confidence. The article "Wild Winds in Hong Kong" in the newspaper on April 7th stated: "Leftists believe that the Communist bandits will definitely cross the Yangtze River, possibly as early as recently, and no later than May 1." This record is clearly an exaggeration and promotion for the bandits. It is now early July, and the Communist bandits have not only not crossed the Yangtze River, but after the failure of the bandit army in the Central Plains war, there is no hope of crossing the Yangtze River. This fact is sufficient to prove that the newspaper is exaggerating the bandit's strength and intending to intimidate. The article "Perspectives on the Defense of the Daba Mountains" on May 1 stated that the potential of the Communist bandits in Sichuan is very large, which is even more obviously intended to shake people's confidence and disturb the rear.</p>
<p>(3) Falsely reporting facts and slandering the National Army. The article "Northwestern Yunnan War Situation" in the newspaper on April 14th stated, "National Army District A is fighting desperately, District B is watching indifferently. Henan is tense, ignoring Shandong. Guanzhong is in a hurry, ignoring Luoyang," and also said, "The National Army is controlled by others." Also, in the article "Zhangjiakou Was Once Tense" on April 18th, it was stated, "Although there are many Communist bandits captured by the National Army, they are all National Army soldiers who were captured." These are all counter-propaganda that shakes the morale of the National Army. In addition, the newspaper article "Remembering the Wancheng Militia" wantonly insulted the militia, sowing discord between the military and the people, and implied the critical situation of Sichuan and Hubei after the bandit army occupied Wancheng, in order to exaggerate the bandit's strength. Furthermore, the article "Students Who Escaped from Kaifeng Talk About the Looting After Being Targeted by Artillery" on June 26th actually claimed that all the large and small buildings in the commercial district of Kaifeng were flattened by the Air Force's bombing, and 60,000 to 70,000 people were killed or injured. However, our Air Force did not engage in the indiscriminate bombing described by the newspaper, as evidenced by the remarks of Yao Congwu, the president of Henan University. The newspaper took advantage of the tense situation in the eastern Henan war to fabricate facts, attempting to incite society and mobilize public opinion to oppose the Air Force's bombing of the war zone. There are countless such remarks and news reports that spread rumors and mislead the public, hindering the suppression of rebellion.</p>
<p>The above is only a selection of the most prominent events. The Ministry has also recorded and filed other opinions, essays, news reports, and communications with similar natures and intentions, which can be consulted at any time. All of this is intentionally spreading rumors, shaking people's confidence, defaming the National Army, and hindering the suppression of rebellion. It violates Articles 21 and 23 of the Publication Law, which stipulate that publications must not promote or record propaganda that damages the interests of the Republic of China or disrupts public order. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 of the same law, it has been permanently suspended from publication.</p>
<p>The government protects freedom of speech and publication in accordance with the law, and has always cherished and supported the development of cultural and news undertakings. However, during this period of suppressing the rebellion, if there are any words or deeds that hinder military affairs or violate the law, we cannot bend the law to forgive them. We must impose sanctions in accordance with the law. This is what we must solemnly inform the people of today.</p>
<h3>Zhu Shaohou and Others Host a Banquet to Bid Farewell to All Sectors in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Office, August 8th] Zhu Shaohou and the heads of the Shaanxi Provincial Government hosted a grand banquet on the 8th to bid farewell to the heads of all sectors, gentry, and senators here. During the discussions on the current situation, they believed that the Qing court's situation during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was much stronger than the current situation. Zhang Xiangchu, a senior gentleman from Shaanxi, handed over the housing deed for the houses he donated for disaster relief during the banquet to Mr. Zhu for forwarding to the superiors.</p>
<h3>Han Air Force Dispatches Multiple Batches to Search for Bandit Traces in Southern Henan and Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, August 8th] The local Air Force dispatched multiple batches to search for bandit traces in southern Henan and northern Hubei, and closely monitored the bandit troops fleeing east along the Tangbai River towards Xiangfan. Four newly built communication trenches were discovered north of Fancheng, extending directly to the edge of the city. Low-altitude strafing was immediately carried out, and many hidden bandits were killed. Subsequently, more than 80 bandits traveling south between Jingshan and Yingcheng were bombed and killed.</p>
<h3>British Confirmed to Have Illegally Built Roads on the Border of Kham and Tibet; Yunnan Provincial Government Submitted Report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs After Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Office, August 8th] Regarding the British illegal construction of roads in Geji, Ningyu, Bomi, and other places on the border of Kham and Tibet, the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters has telegraphed the Yunnan and Xikang Provincial Governments to collect evidence to facilitate negotiations. After receiving the order, the Yunnan Provincial Government instructed the five administrative bureaus adjacent to Kangyin, including Deqin, Baoshan, Fubai, Bijiang, and Lushui, to investigate. It has now been confirmed that the British, starting from Sadiya in the Arlongmi Province of India, have continued to build north along Ningyu towards Wasar. The conditions are to allow Tibetan merchants to transport 500 dan of wool and wool fabric annually, and to grant special export permits for guns, ammunition, cotton yarn, and musical instruments. A report has been submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting prompt and effective measures.</p>
<h3>General Review of the Central Plains Campaign Released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has recently released "General Review of the Central Plains Campaign," the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Enemy's Intent</p>
<p>Since the bandit Liu Bocheng crossed the river and fled to Central China, he has been at a loss. Although the bandit gangs of Chen Yi and Chen Geng have continuously provided support, they have achieved little. Thus, starting from January of this year, Chen Yi gathered the bandit troops under his command, the 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns, and the Guangdong-Guangxi Rapid Column, as well as Liu Bocheng's bandit 11th Column and part of Chen's 3rd and 8th Headquarters, concentrated and reorganized them on the north bank of the Yellow River, strengthened training, and painstakingly planned to target our 5th and 18th Armies. After five months of replenishment and preparation, they crossed the river again to western Shandong in early June to carry out their so-called summer offensive conspiracy, to fight a decisive battle with our National Army, and to disrupt the National Army's June plan to clear Central China.</p>
<p>(2) The Enemy's and Our Situation</p>
<p>This time, the bandit Chen's intrusion into the Central Plains can be said to be an all-out attack. The main forces were the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th Columns, Guangdong-Guangxi, and Rapid Column, totaling six columns. The people in the border areas of Jin, Ji, Yu, and Lu were almost completely mobilized. On their left flank, Xu Shiyou, leading the New 7th, 8th, 9th, 13th, and other columns, besieged Yanzhou. The 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns attacked Kaifeng. Furthermore, Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns, and Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns, along with two columns dispatched by Xu Xiangqian from southern Jin, were deployed on the Pinghan Railway and its flanks to contain the National Army's reinforcements. In total, there were about twenty columns, with a total force of over 300,000 men. Before the intrusion, Zhu De personally went to western Shandong, gathered the officers and soldiers for a lecture, and vowed that he would not bear the surname Zhu again if the 5th Army was not annihilated. They first attacked Kaifeng and then proceeded to a decisive battle.</p>
<p>The National Army initially had an inferior strength. After ten days of fighting in western Shandong, the bandits gained nothing. Subsequently, the bandit 3rd, 8th, 10th, and other columns, which had intruded from western Henan, took advantage of the situation and captured Kaifeng. The National Army rushed to reinforce them overnight. The bandits then took the opportunity to gather in the Qixian and Suixian areas for a decisive battle with the National Army.</p>
<p>(3) Course of the Battle</p>
<p>Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, 6th Columns, Guangdong-Guangxi, and Rapid Column, and Liu Bocheng's 1st and 11th Columns, plus Chen Yi's 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns retreating from Kaifeng, and the local communist forces of Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, and others, totaled 150,000 men. Starting from the 28th of last month, they were surrounded by the National Army in the area between Suixian and Qixian and fiercely attacked. The bandit army struggled desperately. By the beginning of this month, the fighting had become increasingly fierce. The bandits successively sent reinforcements to Yuxiangpu, Longwangdian, and other places, using their superior forces to launch a counterattack against our forces left for dead. The two sides repeatedly charged and counter-charged, advanced and retreated. In the first three days, our 75th Division and the New 21st Brigade suffered heavy losses after five days of continuous fierce fighting. Subsequently, they were surrounded and夹击合力 by strong corps on the left and right wings toward Diqiudian (east of Yuxiangpu), Taolinggang (west of Yuxiangpu), and other places, coupled with the air force's fierce bombing. By July 4, the bandit army had suffered more than 40,000 casualties. After the 4th, the bandits fled in all directions within our counter-encirclement, unable to escape. Their food and ammunition were running out, supplies were difficult, casualties were everywhere, and desertions increased sharply. At this point, the bandits realized that the situation was over and could not be reversed. In addition, the air force continuously and fiercely bombed the bandit army's positions with large formations for several days, and the bandit's positions were completely destroyed. The bandit army's casualties were particularly heavy, and many of the bandit's high-level command posts were also destroyed. The bandits struggled until the morning of the 7th and could no longer sustain themselves, so they began a full-scale rout. Except for the remnants of Chen Yi's main force of six columns, which fled towards western Shandong, their 3rd and 8th Columns, and Liu's forces and the local communist bandits Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, and other bandit forces, fled south. The National Army is continuing to pursue them. The campaign has temporarily come to an end here.</p>
<p>(4) Review of the Campaign</p>
<p>From Xia Suixian, Qi, and Tongxu areas, corpses were scattered all over the fields, and the bandit army's military supplies and corpses were mixed and abandoned, covering the wilderness for fifty li in length and breadth. The scene was everywhere, indicating the misery of their defeat. Since the start of the campaign on the 26th of last month until the complete defeat of the bandits on the 7th, the total number of bandits wounded, killed, deserted, including militia and local communists, has exceeded 80,000. The 1st and 4th Columns lost more than half their strength, the 6th and Guangdong-Guangxi Columns lost nearly half their strength, and the 3rd, 8th, 10th, 11th, Rapid, and other columns each lost one-third of their strength, which is the greatest blow the bandits have suffered since their southward intrusion. Although the bandit army boasts of being good at replenishment, this time they have suffered a great loss of vitality and heavy casualties. It is feared that they will not be able to complete the reorganization in three months. Although we also lost one division and one brigade in this campaign, the ratio of casualties between us and the bandits is three to one, the bandits' attempt, prepared for half a year, has been shattered. The war situation in the Central Plains has turned from danger to safety in this victory. In the future, if the overall war in Central China can be effectively coordinated with the national mobilization, then the bandit army's future intrusions will be decisively struck everywhere.</p>

<p>The great battle in the Yellow River flood area of eastern Henan, after nine days and nights of bloody fighting and hunger by our loyal and brave soldiers, has finally achieved an unprecedented victory! This great victory not only shattered the enemy's attempt to threaten the area between the Yangtze, Huai, Xu, and Si Rivers from western Henan, but also achieved the initial task of capturing the enemy's main force for annihilation. The main force of 200,000 men under the command of the three bandits Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng, who had intruded into the area between Tongxu in the south and the two counties of Qi and Sui, has been annihilated by more than half. A part of the remnant bandits fled north across the Sea Road to western Shandong, and another part fled southwest from the Qi and Sui areas. The National Army is taking advantage of the victory and pursuing and suppressing the fleeing bandits in separate routes under the powerful cover of the air force. This decisive and unprecedented victory is being transmitted to all parts of the country on the anniversary of the July 7th Resistance War, and the people are invigorated and feel especially inspired. This is the greatest result of the anti-bandit military operations in the past year, and it is even more important than the great victory of annihilation in the Jingwei River Valley in early May this year. Some people compare it to the Battle of Feishui in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In fact, this not only laid the foundation for the partial peace of the Eastern Jin Dynasty like the Battle of Feishui, but also stabilized Central China and restored North China. It is a turning point in the anti-bandit military operations in the past two years.</p>
<p>If we review the counter-insurgency military operations of the past year, the strategy adopted by the communists was originally a kind of "mobile warfare," flowing east and west. On the surface, it seems that there is no fixed goal, but in reality, the communists specialize in attacking the weak points of the National Army's defense line, taking advantage of weaknesses and attacking with "big" to eat "small." The so-called unexpected attack is not so mysterious. In fact, this kind of "mobile warfare" is the embodiment of the guerrilla warfare adopted by the communists in the past. The difference is that the purpose of guerrilla warfare is only to destroy transportation and disrupt local order, while the purpose of the current mobile warfare is strictly to capture large strongholds. Therefore, in addition to "mobile warfare," it is inevitable to fight positional battles. From the capture of Luoyang in March of this year to the temporary entry into Kaifeng in June, it can be said that it was the golden age for the communists to adopt a mobile strategy. On the National Army's side, on the one hand, because the guards were responsible for their duties, no stronghold could be easily abandoned. On the other hand, because the initial command was not unified, the National Army clearly lacked a kind of mobility in combat, and was thus placed in a somewhat passive position. The successive fall of the famous cities of Luoyang and Kaifeng in the Central Plains into the hands of the bandits cannot but be said to be the result of strategic errors on the part of the National Army.</p>
<p>Although the previous temporary fall of Kaifeng once formed a crisis in the Central Plains and caused a public outcry, it also gave the National Army a painful lesson. Later, the rapid recovery of Kaifeng, the formation of the encirclement in the Yellow River flood area, and the great victory of this annihilation war are indeed a major gain from the military authorities' "teaching war with shame" and changing their strategy. Observing the course of this Central Plains campaign, it is not difficult to point out the reasons for this great victory of the National Army: (1) The full play of the National Army's mobility, not only able to seize the opportunity to capture the main force of the bandit army, but also to march quickly and immediately form an encirclement of the main force of the bandit army, so that the bandit army's "遝动战" strategy could not be used; (2) The close cooperation between the land and air forces of the National Army made it impossible for the bandit army to escape the fate of being annihilated.</p>
<p>Kaifeng fell into the hands of the bandits on June 22. Because the gain or loss of this famous city in the Central Plains is not only related to the safety of Henan Province, but also sufficient to affect the entire war situation, the National Army rushed to aid in three routes, one from Lanfeng to the west, one from Zhengzhou to the east, and one from 对氏 to the north, and met in Biancheng on the 25th. 印兵团 entered Kaifeng City first on the 26th, and this important town in the Central Plains was recovered. At that time, after the bandit army fled southeast into the Yellow River flood area, one was due to the "underestimation of the enemy" mentality of the district bandits, and the other was due to its past strategy of "avoiding the real and attacking the empty," and still concentrated its main force between Qi and Sui,妄图 using a positional warfare strategy to一　, and the other was due to the geographical situation of the Central Plains. In the Yellow River flood area of a large plain, it was impossible to flee elsewhere without being pursued by our air force, so the bandit army had to concentrate its main force and fight a decisive battle with the main force of the National Army,拼一个 "you die or I live" decisive battle. The battle opened its bloody curtain on June 28. The National Army captured Qixian on the morning of the 29th, annihilated more than 1,000 bandit troops, and forced Chen's main force to gather in Suixian. This was the first test of the National Army's edge in this campaign, and also the prelude to the great victory of this annihilation war. From then on, the two sides engaged in a life-and-death struggle in the encirclement and counter-encirclement positions in the area of the three counties of Qi, Sui, and Tongxu. Our powerful air force also cooperated with the army at any time, in order to annihilate the main force of Chen Yi, Chen Geng, and Liu Bocheng in the Yellow River flood area. Our Supreme Commander also flew to the battlefield in the Yellow River flood area on the 2nd of this month, and the morale of the National Army was even more invigorated. On the morning of the 2nd, the National Army had won the first round of victory, shattering the enemy's attempt to "eat small with big." Moreover, when the western advance corps fought the bandits in the Diqiudian area east of Suixian, the eastern advance corps had also captured Hanzhai west of Suixian, thus completing the encirclement. The National Army used three divisions as the core position, used internal operations to attract the bandit army, while the Qiu, Hu, and Sun corps were on the outer line, making a large encirclement of the bandit army, making the bandit army a "ham" in a "sandwich." The fate of most of them being annihilated has been decided in the headquarters of our commander. The frequent good news the day before yesterday was already within our expectations, and we can assert that there will be even more pleasing and surprising news in the coming days.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the victory in the great battle in the Yellow River flood area, in addition to relying on the loyal and brave soldiers of our army to give their lives, the coordinated operations of the air force are also one of the decisive factors in achieving this annihilation war. Although we do not completely believe in "air force decisive victory," in order to deal with the communists' elusive "mobile warfare" and seek a way to control it, it is necessary for the air force to cooperate with the army. Recently, some people in society have attempted to 一　　a kind of "anti-bombing movement," which seems to be for humanitarianism on the surface, but in reality, it is nothing more than providing excuses for the shortcomings of the communists, helping the communists find a 一　口, using the big hat of "humanitarianism" to restrict the activities of our air force, forcing our National Army to passively take beatings! It must be known that if they are sincerely talking about humanitarianism, they should strongly advise the communists to turn over a new leaf, lay down their weapons, and become reformed citizens, no longer engaging in treasonous activities. Then the flames of war can be dissipated, and why bother the National Army to carry out a large-scale suppression? Is it only the communists' killing, arson, and seizing of cities and lands that are in line with humanitarianism, while the National Army's land and air coordination,痛扫 rebellious bandits, restoring order, and stabilizing people's hearts, is contrary to humanitarianism? We must not only be deceived by these strange arguments with ulterior motives, but also praise the power of the air force for making contributions to the country.</p>
<p>In short, this victory in the Yellow River flood area is indeed a major turning point in our country's anti-bandit military operations. From encirclement to annihilation, there is nothing that cannot be a model for our country's anti-bandit operations. From now on, troops across the country will change their strategies, invigorate their morale, give full play to the army's mobility, capture the main force of the bandit army, annihilate them in one fell swoop, and reveal to the whole country that the goal of our country's anti-bandit military operations in the future is not the gain or loss of a city or a place, but the number of bandits annihilated. Only in this way, we cannot be too optimistic about the frequent good news coming from the Yellow River flood area. Now the remnants of the bandit army are fleeing in three directions: northeast, southeast, and northwest, and the two large groups fleeing to western Shandong and northern Anhui have the妄图妄图徐州进窥, so a great battle in Xuzhou seems to be brewing again. Our land and air forces should take advantage of the victory and pursue them, so that the escaped bandits cannot succeed elsewhere. Here, with great enthusiasm, we look forward to another great victory in the Battle of Xuzhou!</p>

(4) Statistics on casualties in Kaifeng: (甲) 432 deaths among the transient population, 564 injured, 185 seriously, and 379 lightly. (乙) 1,078 resident deaths, 1,557 injured, 520 seriously, and 1,037 lightly. (丙) 19 public servant deaths, 41 injured, 8 seriously, and 33 lightly. (丁) 36 student deaths, 75 injured, 21 seriously, and 54 lightly. (戊) 22 public and educational personnel deaths, 42 injured, 10 seriously, and 32 lightly. A total of 1,587 deaths, 2,279 injured, 744 seriously, and 1,535 lightly. Minister Gu continued, "Among the 36 student deaths, 3 belonged to National Henan University. Their deaths were not due to bombing but to other reasons. The damage to the National Henan University buildings was very minimal. The claim in the news that the air force indiscriminately bombed is absolutely inaccurate." According to Minister Gu, the air force's bombing and strafing targets were only the communist bandits' positions. Stray bullets and shrapnel may have injured innocent people, but it was definitely not intentional.</p>
<p>After the government investigated the casualties and losses of the people of Kaifeng, it immediately took various emergency relief measures, dispatched a relief service team to Kaifeng, and has repeatedly allocated and brought relief funds to the area for distribution. To date, nearly 400 billion (currency unit) in relief funds have been distributed, including 50 billion (currency unit) brought by Minister Gu, 30 billion (currency unit) brought by the Ministry of Social Affairs service team, 10 billion (currency unit) transferred by the Zhengzhou Central Bank at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs, 200 billion (currency unit) allocated by the Executive Yuan, 80 billion (currency unit) specially allocated by the President to the Henan Provincial Government and Kaifeng Municipal Government employees, 7 billion (currency unit) in special relief funds for National Henan University, and 15 billion (currency unit) for relief to refugees and students from Henan who came to Nanjing. The Central Government will also allocate special funds to provide relief to the employees of the Longhai Railway and other central agencies stationed in Kaifeng.</p>
<p>To date, the Central Government has separately distributed 10 million (currency unit) in relief funds to the families of those who died or were seriously injured in the war, 5 million (currency unit) to those who were slightly injured, 10 million (currency unit) each to those whose houses were destroyed by the bandit army, 3 million (currency unit) each to other poor refugees, 10 million (currency unit) each to public and educational personnel, and 3 million (currency unit) each to students.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Social Affairs has established a temporary office in Kaifeng, in conjunction with the Henan Provincial Government, to oversee the relief work.</p>

<h3>Six-Nation Agreement on the West German Question - Britain and the United States Express Disappointment, Poland Protests - The Chaotic and Unstable Situation in Germany is Due to the Soviet Union - Polish Interests Have Not Been Considered and a Complaint Should Be Filed with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Poland lodged a note with Britain and the United States on June 18, protesting the resolutions of the London Six-Nation Conference. Britain and the United States individually responded to Poland today, rejecting Poland's protest, and stating that the actions taken by the Western countries were forced upon them due to the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate, therefore Poland's protest should be lodged with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>British Government's Reply:  Declares that Britain's dissatisfaction with the failure of the Four Powers to reach an agreement on Germany is no less than Poland's. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France have repeatedly attempted to reach an agreement, and the Polish government supports the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany, so it is difficult to understand the basis for Poland's protest. The failure of the Western Allies' efforts to reach a Four Power agreement is due to the Soviet Union's repeated obstruction. The United Kingdom and Poland had signed a mutual assistance pact in 1939. Although the Soviet Union had signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany, facilitating Germany's actions, the United Kingdom was still the first country to declare war on Germany to help Poland, and the United Kingdom has always fully recognized Poland's interests. The assertion that the Western powers' agreement on the Ruhr will facilitate German aggression is also inaccurate. The United Kingdom has taken every possible measure to prevent German re-aggression, and the agreement on the Ruhr can ensure that Germany does not misuse its economic power for aggression. The London Conference did not discuss the issue of reparations. Poland can be assured that Britain will recognize its responsibility in this matter. The provisions on the future political organization of West Germany in the London Conference are based on a federal system, which is most suitable for the belief that Germany should be democratized. The regrettable situation in Europe today is directly the responsibility of the Soviet Union.  Since the Polish government supports the Soviet Union's attitude, inviting Poland to exchange views with the British government on matters related to Germany, is not only useless in the current environment, but will also put the Polish government's relationship with the Soviet Union in an embarrassing position. The British government is determined not to divide Germany or revive a strong Germany. The Polish government has no need to fear this. However, the British government must take the necessary actions to deal with the current situation, and the formation of this situation is not the responsibility of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Contents of the US Note:  US Undersecretary of State Lovett delivered a note to the Polish Ambassador to the United States in Washington today. The note also instructed the Polish government to lodge its complaints about the resolutions of the London Conference with the Soviet government. It also said that if countries most severely invaded by Germany believe that their interests have not been considered in the London Conference plan, they should not protest to the United States but to the country that prevented them from cooperating with the European Recovery Program. As for protesting the failure to fully utilize the Four Power Consultative Body, it should also be directed to the occupying powers that created the current situation in Germany and Europe. In the past three years, the Four Powers have held consultations on the German issue without success. The Soviet Union has vetoed resolutions agreed to by the other three powers a total of 69 times. Poland's claim that the United States is attempting to divide Germany is unfounded.  The fact that the European Recovery Program proposed by the United States was not accepted by certain countries, naturally prevents the recovery program from benefiting those countries. The US government is also very displeased with the current state of division in Germany. The Western countries' formulation of a joint plan for West Germany was not their original intention. The US note also denies the point that the London Conference did not fully consider the issue of security, and points out that the London Conference's proposals on the Ruhr and general security have specifically stipulated guarantees to prevent Germany from rebuilding its economic power for future aggression.</p>
<h3>East and West Launch Diplomatic War - Berlin Airlift Reaches Peak - Marshal Sokolovsky to Return Home with Bulganin</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 8th Broadcast: Regarding the British, American, and French memorandum to the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue, although its content has not been released, according to reliable sources, the three countries demanded that the Soviet Union immediately restore transportation to Berlin, and declared that they have absolutely no intention of withdrawing from Berlin.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Foreign Office stated that the full text of the protest note sent by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to the Soviet Union, which was originally scheduled to be released today, has now been postponed. The Foreign Office spokesperson did not explain the reason for this change of plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] People close to the Soviet military government said that Marshal Sokolovsky has been summoned and will return to Moscow in a day or two to meet with Molotov to discuss the situation caused by the Western Three Powers' note to the Soviet Union demanding the lifting of the Berlin blockade. Soviet Defense Minister Bulganin, who arrived in Berlin a few days ago to investigate the mission, will return home on the same plane as Marshal Sokolovsky. The same sources also believe that the Western Three Powers' note has very little chance of resolving the Berlin crisis.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] Amidst the increasingly tense diplomatic war between East and West, the Berlin airlift reached its peak on the 7th. Aircraft from the United States, Britain, and France transported 2,000 tons of supplies to Berlin, including food, coal, medicine, and other important supplies. American C-54 Skymaster aircraft have transported the first batch of 200 tons of airborne coal to the western sector of Berlin. Britain and the United States are also planning to use bombers converted into transport aircraft to drop large quantities of coal from bomb bay doors onto the grounds of the 1936 Olympic Games stadium. It is estimated that if 200 aircraft can be dispatched daily, it will be possible to maintain the power supply after the rationing is reduced. On the diplomatic front, since the United Kingdom, the United States, and France directly protested to Moscow demanding the lifting of the blockade of Berlin, Berlin is anxiously awaiting the Soviet Union's response. The Soviet Union has also lodged three protests with the Western Allies in the past 24 hours. One is to protest the United States' unilateral change of Berlin's air traffic rules, one is to protest the Western occupying authorities' obstruction of trade between the West and East Germany, and one is to protest the landing of British Sunderland flying boats carrying grain in Lake Havel in the American sector of Berlin. When the Soviet authorities protested to the United States about its unilateral change of air traffic rules, they issued a warning, claiming that if the air traffic rules agreed upon by the Four Powers are not adhered to, the safety of air traffic through the air corridors between West Germany and Berlin will no longer be guaranteed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>West Berlin Lacks Coal - Decides to Strictly Enforce Power Conservation</h3>

On the 8th, according to the Soviet-affiliated German News Agency, the Soviet military authorities have agreed to supply electricity to maintain the elevated railway.</p>

<h3>Representatives from the United States, Canada, and Five Western European Nations Continue Discussions in Washington Aiming to Forge a Common Front Against the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] New York, 8th (Broadcast): A spokesman for the U.S. State Department stated that representatives from the five European countries participating in the Brussels Treaty and Canada met again today with U.S. Under Secretary of State Lovett to discuss the implementation of the Vandenberg Resolution. These negotiations have been ongoing for three consecutive days. Influential political circles in the United States believe that the U.S. is assuming the leadership of the Western nations' defense alliance too quickly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] According to well-informed sources, the United States, Canada, and the five parties to the Brussels Pact will continue discussions here for three months, potentially resulting in a "Western European Union" and a political and military alliance in the North Atlantic region. Ostensibly for mutual cooperation, the overarching motivation of the seven nations in the talks is to formulate a common front to address general communism, particularly the Soviet Union. It is understood that the original plan, based on Vandenberg's proposal, included only the five countries of the Western European Union. However, Canada's sudden participation in the talks has expanded the overall scope of U.S. military support and mutual assistance to the North Atlantic region, including Canada's northern borders. The Combined Chiefs of Staff, a wartime organization, is still quietly working here, with military experts from both countries continuing to exchange information about their respective military capabilities. The U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board, another wartime organization, is also continuing its work as an integral part of the North American system.</p>

<h3>Britain Advocates Easing Restrictions on Trade between the Sterling Area and Japan: Representatives from Various Countries Are Consulting with the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers on Solutions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Representatives from countries within the sterling area will consult with officials of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) tomorrow to discuss ways to maximize the level of trade between the sterling area and Japan "without relying on U.S. dollars." Thomas, the financial advisor to the British delegation, told reporters that the two sides will exchange views on the goods they can sell to each other in order to determine the trade trends between the sterling area and Japan for the next twelve months. Thomas pointed out that the Sterling-Based Payments Agreement concluded between SCAP and the sterling area on May 31 is the only way for trade between the sterling area and Japan after the war. He also said that there are still various restrictions that need to be eliminated in order to allow free flow of trade between the two regions. Thomas continued that now is a good time for SCAP and the sterling area to decide what kind of goods they need from each other, especially considering the traditional fact that most of Japan's foreign trade is within the sterling area. Currently, the sterling area mainly needs to purchase cotton textiles from Japan, while Japan wants to purchase raw materials such as cotton, wool, rubber, and minerals from the sterling area.</p>

<h3>City Buses Completely Shut Down: Labor Dispute Comes to an End, Bureau Chief Persuades Until 3 AM: Reinstatement to Be Discussed After All Workers Sign Agreement</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] After the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's Public Transportation Company announced the unpaid leave of 197 drivers and conductors the day before yesterday, the laid-off workers petitioned the Social Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau. Bus lines such as Route 10, Route 9, and Route 3 were once suspended. In the evening, the laid-off workers stayed overnight at the company's workers' welfare association on Gongping Road. At around 4 a.m. yesterday, some workers climbed over the wall into the business office's dispatch room and removed all the copper plaques used by the company to dispatch workers daily, in order to prevent other workers from going to work. At that time, older workers had been arriving at the factory one after another, preparing to go to work, and the number of people gathered became increasingly large. At around 6 a.m., most of the company's 1,500-plus workers had arrived at the factory. Expressing sympathy and indignation for the 18th batch of conductors and the 21st batch of drivers who were placed on unpaid leave, they shouted slogans such as "We want to eat" and "We want to work" in unison, and rushed into the cooperative to grab bread, causing great chaos. The security authorities received the news and dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to maintain order at the bus depot. The situation deteriorated and became increasingly serious. Although some workers were willing to go to work and drive, it was almost impossible. As a result, all bus lines under the company were completely shut down yesterday.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Mayor</p>
<p>At around 10 a.m. yesterday, more than 1,500 drivers, conductors, and other field personnel from the company boarded 21 buses and drove to the City Hall to petition. Traffic was congested along Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road. After arriving at the City Hall, the workers wrote slogans in chalk on the road and walls protesting the "unpaid leave" and lined up to demand an audience with the mayor. Initially, Chief of the Public Relations Section Zhang Bide came out to persuade them and asked them to elect representatives for negotiation. The workers were reluctant to elect representatives because representatives had been dismissed by the company after negotiating with the company authorities last time. Eventually, two messengers were selected, Su Naiding, No. 1050, and Cheng Limin, No. 1055. At around 11 a.m., Mayor Wu and Public Utilities Bureau Chief Zhao received them. Mayor Wu was furious that the workers' gathering to petition was obstructing traffic in the central district. He ordered the two messengers to persuade all the workers to leave the City Hall before 12 p.m. and elect ten representatives to negotiate with the company authorities. The messengers conveyed Mayor Wu's intentions to the crowd, who protested loudly, arguing that they were only asking for food and had not taken any illegal actions. Moreover, because the workers had no labor union organization, no one was willing to serve as a representative on a temporary basis. Therefore, they collectively elected Wang Zongshan, the head of the Transportation Section, and Ding Weitang, the deputy head, as representatives. Wang and Ding refused because of their status as employees, resulting in a stalemate in the petitioning procession. At this time, the Police Bureau dispatched red riot control vehicles and flying fortresses to the scene to maintain order. Police Bureau Chief Yu also rushed to the City Hall to suppress the situation at 12 p.m. By 1 p.m., there were still no results. All the petitioning workers then withdrew from the City Hall and returned to the welfare association on Gongping Road.</p>
<p>Mayor Telephones Company: Severance Pay Increased to Two Months</p>
<p>At 3 p.m., after repeated urging from various parties, the workers finally elected six representatives, including five conductors (Nos. 1050, 1065, 1158, 1142, and 1113) and one driver (No. 1055), to begin negotiations with Ding Weitang, the deputy head of the Transportation Section, and Xuan Qiangong and Chen Kejia, the section chiefs. The workers' representatives put forward two demands: (1) The company should withdraw the dismissal order; (2) Employment security should be provided after reinstatement. The company agreed to increase the severance pay to one month, guaranteed by Deputy Head Ding, but the workers' representatives stated that they could not accept this. At 8:30 p.m., Mayor Wu telegraphed the company authorities, ordering them not to withdraw the dismissal order, to increase the severance pay to two months, and to have the remaining workers return to work today, or they would be considered as having voluntarily resigned and would be dealt with severely according to law.</p>
<p>Workers Still Request Withdrawal of Order</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, Zhang Mingtao, the director of preparations for the Transportation Company, and Ding Weitang, the deputy head of the Transportation Section, immediately went to the welfare association to announce Mayor Wu's solution. The workers still stated that they could not accept it and proposed a solution: the company should allow the new workers to continue working, and all the old workers (referring to conductors before the 18th batch and drivers before the 21st batch) are willing to forgo two days of work each month to subsidize the new workers, so that the company can still achieve the purpose of saving expenses. They asked Zhang and Ding to sign and accept this on the spot. Director Zhang said that the order for unpaid leave could not be changed, but the workers insisted on asking for the withdrawal of the order and did not allow Zhang and Ding to leave the welfare association.</p>
<p>Insistently Invite Bureau Chief Inside for Instruction</p>
<p>At 10 p.m., the eastern area entered a state of temporary alert. The police station of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, the Police Headquarters, and the Garrison Command dispatched more than a thousand police officers, and dispatched fire trucks and red riot control vehicles to the scene to be on guard. Zhao, the chief of the Public Utilities Bureau, Deputy Chief Zhang, Specialist Song Yunhui, and Yu, the chief of the Police Bureau, also arrived at the company one after another to personally mediate. Initially, the workers said that among the six representatives they had elected, driver No. 1055, conductors Nos. 1050, 1065, and 1158, and three old workers who had gone out to inquire about messages, conductors Nos. 847, 957, and 682, were all missing. Later, Wang Zongshan, the head of the group, found the seven people and sent them to the welfare association, and everyone was speechless. Chief Zhao immediately wrote a personal note and sent it to Director Zhang, Deputy Head Ding, and Group Head Wang, who were trapped inside: "I hope you will immediately accompany the 18th batch of conductors and the 21st batch of drivers to gather in front of the Inspection Section to listen to instructions." However, the workers still refused to leave the welfare association, and also did not allow Zhang and Ding to go outside, but insisted on inviting Chief Zhao into the welfare association to give instructions. The stalemate could not be broken, and the situation became more and more serious.</p>
<p>At 1:40 a.m. this morning, Chief Zhao decided to personally come to the entrance of the welfare group and planned to use a loudspeaker to instruct all the workers. However, everyone refused to listen and retreated into the welfare group's auditorium. Chief Zhao, accompanied by Chief Yu of the Police Bureau and others, entered the auditorium and announced to everyone: (1) Each of the 18th batch of conductors and the 21st batch of drivers will receive two months' salary and bonuses up to the 7th. Those who wish to return home can receive it today. They are expected to find jobs within two months. When the company's situation improves, they may be allowed to return to work. (2) You are all acting impulsively, destroying objects, and kidnapping the company's negotiators, regardless of the consequences. This is a violation of discipline. You must know that it is okay not to work in the future, but it is absolutely unacceptable not to behave like human beings. (3) The company's transportation lines are urgently needed by the public. You are making it difficult for the public by demanding shutdowns. The reputation that the company has painstakingly built with the citizens in the past three years should not be destroyed by you with one hand. Chief Zhao then painfully stated that he had trained tens of thousands of telecommunications technicians in Zhejiang for ten years, all of whom were able to serve the country, but in the three years he had trained a large number of transportation talents in Shanghai, it had caused today's incident, which he deeply regretted. Finally, he ordered the people on the scene to raise their hands and count the numbers separately. There were only 40 drivers left in the 21st batch, and only 50 conductors left in the 18th batch. Chief Zhao declared that he would keep his promise and asked them to return to Gaochang Temple or their homes to rest as soon as possible. At this time, conductor No. 1161, Shen Hanshi, suddenly stepped forward to the stage and shook hands with Chief Zhao, crying bitterly and telling about his life. He said that his pain was beyond the authorities' estimation. What is the use of a meager two months' salary? Moreover, it is not easy to find a job. How will his family live in Shanghai? After Chief Zhao's investigation, it was found that Shen had not slept or eaten for two days and was afraid of losing his job. Last night at 9 p.m., he jumped off the welfare association building in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, the building was not very high, and he was temporarily unconscious. He was fortunate to recover later. He was ordered to be dealt with separately, but everyone was still restless. It was not until about 3 a.m. that Chief Zhao, considering the urgent need to resume work today, was willing to make concessions and instructed all the old colleagues to sign their names and submit them to the company authorities within four days. The company could consider giving them two days of work each month to subsidize the conductors and drivers of the 18th and 21st batches to be reinstated. Thus, the dispute that had been delayed for two days finally came to an end. The workers left one after another, and Chief Zhao and others returned to their residences.</p>

<h3>How Expensive Are Nylon Stockings: Old Ones Sell for 20 Million Each</h3>
<p>The import and sale of nylon stockings have been banned, and the Municipal Council has passed a resolution to stop the sale of all nylon stockings that have not been sold out before August 1st on the following day. After the news spread, things became scarce and expensive, which made the "high-ranking citizens" very interested in this. They believe that they will not be able to obtain them in the future, and have been rushing to buy them in recent days. Therefore, the market price has soared, and each pair is sold for 20 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Food Supply for the Poor: Subsidized Rice Sales to Be Held Next Month</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Recently, rice prices have soared, and the distribution price of household rice has also increased accordingly. Therefore, most poor people cannot afford to buy household rice. The Civil Food Allocation Committee and the Social Bureau, in view of this, plan to start distributing rice to the poor and holding subsidized rice sales next month. The Baojia chiefs are responsible for conducting detailed investigations into the lives of the poor, limited to those who cannot maintain their livelihood and need relief. Each person is allowed to purchase one dou per month. The price will be publicly announced by the municipal government each month, possibly similar to the rice distribution price for journalists and elementary school teachers. Another consultation will be held today.</p>
<h3>Department Stores' Pay Raise: Difficult to Decide</h3>
<p>Another consultation will be held today.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The employees of ten major department stores in the city, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Great World, and China National Products, have demanded an increase in base salary, and a dispute has arisen with the employers. Since the Social Bureau's mediation, the employers have agreed in principle to the employees' demands, but both labor and management have asked the Social Bureau to decide how much to increase. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Director Wu, who said that because the business conditions of each company are different, for example, the daily income of Wing On Company is equivalent to the five-day income of China National Products Company, it is very difficult to decide on a uniform number. Labor and management will be invited again today to discuss a suitable solution.</p>
<h3>Warehouses Storing Goods Must Register Within a Time Limit: Otherwise, They Will Be Confiscated if Discovered</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Social Bureau has drafted a warehouse inspection plan, which will be implemented after being submitted to today's Municipal Government meeting for discussion.

The above (1) and (2) types each have a competent authority and are easy to manage. The main points of the measures formulated by the Social Bureau are to focus on the registration and inspection of self-provided warehouses. All such warehouses must register their inventory with the Social Bureau within the prescribed date. The Social Bureau will conduct spot checks at any time together with the competent authority. If the registration is delayed, it will be treated as a private warehouse upon discovery, and all the goods stored in it, whether they are daily necessities or other goods, will be confiscated and confiscated, and citizens will be rewarded for reporting at any time.</p>
<h3>Shipping Rates to Be Adjusted Again: Average Increase of 110 Percent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon to discuss adjusting shipping rates. The result was that since the shipping rates were adjusted on July 1, the various expenses of the shipping industry have increased by an average of 118 percent. For cost considerations, it was decided that passenger and freight transportation should be adjusted by 110 percent uniformly, otherwise it would be difficult to maintain. The transshipment fee for Shanghai-Hankou goods will be increased to 5.2 million yuan per ton, and the transshipment fee for Hankou-Yichang will be increased to 4 million yuan. The surcharge for heavy goods will be increased by 110 percent. As for the four major factors in the shipping industry's expenses, the calculation method is as follows: From July 1 to August 8, coal increased by 160 percent, diesel increased by 49 percent, the cost of living index increased by 103 percent, and hardware materials increased by 160 percent, so the average increase was 110 percent. The implementation date of the shipping rate increase will be around the 15th.</p>

<h3>Fired and Holding a Grudge: Arson Kills Five: Tragedy on Fuxing Middle Road, Perpetrator Surrenders After the Incident</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Lu Zimei, a Chaozhou native, 41 years old, had been working at the Qiaxing Pawnshop at No. 1 Fuxing Middle Road for more than 20 years. Recently, he was fired because the pawnshop's business was sluggish. Lu only received more than 9 million in severance pay and could not return home. He repeatedly asked the pawnshop owner, Xu Songjia, to increase it, but without success. Therefore, he harbored resentment and hatred. At 5 a.m. yesterday, he got up from his bed and ignited two boxes of kerosene next to him with oiled paper, setting a fire. Suddenly, flames soared. Lu, seeing that he had caused a great disaster, had a moment of conscience and shouted "Fire!" from the back door. The local fire brigade arrived at the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished after an hour. However, the six members of the family of Gao Jianqing, the assistant manager of the pawnshop, who were sleeping upstairs, were only able to save Gao Zihou. The rest were buried in the fire. Afterwards, Lu, realizing that he could not escape the law, rushed to the Bund on Zhongzheng East Road to commit suicide by jumping into the river. He suddenly changed his mind, thinking of his elderly parents and young children, and did not want to die immediately. So he turned around and surrendered to the Songshan Police Precinct, admitting his guilt. He confessed to the arson process without denying anything. The case is currently being handled by the precinct.</p>

<h3>Passed Through Two Storms; Safe Arrival</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Hangli and Jiangkang liners safely returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. It is reported that the two liners left Hong Kong for Shanghai simultaneously on the morning of the 7th. Although the weather was unfavorable with strong winds, the voyage was without incident. However, upon reaching the Baishui River, the wind and waves gradually increased, making progress increasingly difficult. The Jiangkang liner reached the Wusongkou at around 10:00 AM, but was unable to enter the port due to the obstruction of wind and waves. At that time, the ship was tilting from side to side, and waves crashed into the cabins, causing great alarm among the passengers. Seeing this critical situation, the captain calmly gave the command to turn around and return to Hong Kong for temporary shelter. They set sail for Shanghai again yesterday morning, arriving at the Bund No. 4 pier at around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Hangli liner encountered the same difficulties as the Jiangkang liner. Reaching the Shizilin at Baoshanjiao, it was in a perilous situation, and one of the propeller blades fell off. The captain immediately ordered the ship to sail towards Chongming Island, anchoring at Baozhen to shelter from the wind, thus averting the danger. They returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, entering the port at around 9:00 AM and docking at the Bund pier. Due to the loss of the propeller blade, the ship is temporarily out of service for repairs.</p>

<h3>Kaifeng Experiences a Sudden Windstorm and Rain; Coming Quickly and Going Quickly; Liu Maoen Says: We Must Strive for Survival in the Ruins</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Kaifeng, One Day Ago] After the bandits invaded Kaifeng, the streets were filled with slogans and leaflets, full of words like "Liberate Kaifeng." What exactly did it "liberate?" Here is a brief account:</p>
<p>(1) Thoroughly destroyed the machinery of the Pulin Power Plant and the Fuyu Flour Mill, and plundered countless books, instruments, and specimens from the Provincial Library, Museum, and Henan University.</p>
<p>(2) On the 18th, over 300 officers and soldiers of the Security Regiment were collectively executed in Hanjia Camp in the southern suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>And one of the most alarming things is: the massacre of 5,000 brave soldiers of the National Army.</p>
<p>The fact is this: After the bandits captured Kaifeng, on the evening of the 22nd, they formed over 5,000 captured officers and soldiers into a team and escorted them to the Yellow River crossing in the northwest of Kaifeng. First, they told the captured people to rest and drink water. When everyone squatted on the Yellow River beach, dozens of pre-arranged heavy machine guns opened fire, ending the lives of my 5,000 brave soldiers and venting their bestial desires. The Communist bandits were very cunning. They hid on the Yellow River beach to carry out the collective massacre, but they did not expect that a platoon leader named Huang Zheng from the artillery battalion of the 66th Division, who survived by chance, escaped and announced this inhuman fact. When Commander Qiu Qingquan told me this fact, he was extremely delighted. He said: I am happier to receive this news than to hear that my troops have annihilated 100,000 enemies. Based on this point, I can be sure that the Communist bandits are not difficult to eliminate! It is said that after the shooting, the Communist bandits threw the bodies of more than 5,000 people into the Yellow River, which may be the so-called "covering up the corpses," but will the hatred of the people also disappear with the rolling waters of the Yellow River?</p>
<p>When Kaifeng was in danger, the East, West, and South route reinforcements, including Guo's brigade advancing east from Zhengzhou, were intercepted by Chen Geng's 9th Column in Zhongmu. Hu Lian's corps, advancing north from southern Henan, was blocked by Liu Bocheng's troops north of Shangcai. Qiu Qingquan's corps, the most powerful and promising, marched west from near Jinxiang, western Shandong, on the 18th, a long distance of 500 li, a long journey of seven or eight days. The "Fire Bull Army," which had fought in the area of Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui for two years, repeatedly defeated the blocking attempts of Chen's 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns, and finally captured Kaifeng on the 26th.</p>
<p>On the 25th, in the headquarters of Qiu's corps, I heard that Chairman Liu Maoen had escaped danger and was residing in the headquarters of the 83rd Division. So I visited him with Deputy Division Commander Xiao San of the 5th Reorganized Division. The next day, at 4:00 PM, Kaifeng was recovered. I followed Chairman Liu and Zhou Liefan, the Director of the Provincial News Office, and President Wang of the Henan Provincial Business School, who had escaped danger and coincidentally met the Chairman, into Kaifeng at 7:50 PM.</p>
<p>The ancient city in the setting sun, sand and dust filled the sky, the four suburbs of the city, new graves piled up, three or four hungry dogs, tottering and limping, the atmosphere was tragic and solemn, this is war!</p>
<p>Our car, under the step-by-step exploration of the mine sweeper, drove into Bian City. Chairman Liu Maoen stood on the jeep with the roof open, waving to the citizens. Thousands of people could not help but clap and cheer, welcoming Chairman Liu, who entered Bianyuan only four hours after the recovery.</p>
<p>The setting sun shrouded the destroyed Xiangguo Temple, the Post Office Building, the Provincial Government Building, the Women's Normal School, Zhongqi, the Pulin Power Plant, ... dangerous walls standing tall, tiles piled up, looking at these ruined walls, Chairman Liu sighed repeatedly to the reporter.</p>
<p>In the rubble piles of the Provincial Government and the Post Office Building, there were still several places smoking, and the streets were filled with the smell of burning, sometimes faint and sometimes strong. This smell stimulated people's hearts. At this time and place, everyone would think: when can the devastation be restored?</p>
<p>The power plant was burned down, the power lines were destroyed, and the telephone poles beside the street were lying on the ground, east and west. There were no lights, and only the lights on the military vehicles were shining on the dark road. Please do not neglect this faint light, it is precisely a glimmer of hope that the 500,000 people of Kaifeng have been hoping for for four days!</p>
<p>On the night of Chairman Liu's return to Bian, he and several key officials of the Provincial Government who had escaped danger, such as Secretary-General Ma Lingfu, Director of Education Wang Gongdu, Director of the News Office Zhou Liefan, and General Manager Yang Xiansheng of the Provincial Bank, planned measures to appease the people and restore order. The next day, the Provincial Government's notice to appease the people was posted in the streets and alleys. A batch of police officers withdrawn from Luoyang, transported by Langzhou vehicles, arrived in Bianyuan and immediately began to work. A large army gathered in Kaifeng, and the generals were discussing plans to defend Bianyuan. The political workers of the 5th Army were handling the work of providing relief to the people and treating the people. The official propaganda vehicles were running non-stop on the major streets. The people spontaneously posted slogans: "Welcome Chairman Liu," "Welcome Commander Qiu," "Welcome the Fifth Army," ... Obviously, after suffering from the terror of the Reds, the people began to look forward to getting a little warmth in the embrace of the government.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of General Li Zhongxin, the Division Commander of the 66th Reorganized Division, was still a mystery on the morning of the 27th. Suicide? The body could not be found. Captured? In the Communist bandits' broadcasts, only Staff Officer You of the Division Headquarters and Brigade Commander Zhang of the 13th Brigade were mentioned, but his name was not mentioned. Breakout? It seemed impossible in fact. Even if possible, why has there been no news for three days? On the morning of the 27th, I drove to Longting, where General Li's headquarters was located. Longting was the former site of the imperial palace of the Northern Song Dynasty, and it was the last stronghold to fall in this battle. I endured the smell of corpses and walked around (it is better to say mourned). There were corpses with broken legs and arms, crouching beside bricks and tiles, or submerged in the pool of water. There were the shells of more than 20 cars that had been burned by the bandits. There were unusable cannons, unexploded grenades, artillery shells, and hats, shoes, and socks left by the soldiers.</p>
<p>I climbed up to a nearby bunker on the north city wall and met two officers. One was Tan Shiying, the adjutant of the 66th Division Commander, and the other was Platoon Leader Liu of the Division's Special Service Battalion. They were there to find General Li's remains. After talking, I unintentionally confirmed the news of General Li's suicide. According to them, on the evening of the 21st, the bandits broke into Beiguan, and the North and South routes concentrated their firepower and pounced on Longting. At this time, General Li had already suffered a serious leg injury in Longting, and the situation of Longzu was very dangerous. So Adjutant Tan carried Li from the right side of Longting to this bunker in the north of the city, at 8:10 PM. The general's bravery could not change the deterioration of the situation. Seeing the Communist bandits gradually approaching the bunker, General Li Zhongxin could not save the situation. In the traditional spirit of a revolutionary soldier, at 9:15 PM, he took a revolver pistol that he wore with him, pointed it at his right temple, and killed himself with one shot. Where the blood splashed, he wrote a clear and brilliant page in the history of the suppression of the rebellion!</p>
<p>Adjutant Tan was on the side at the time. Because he was assisting in the battle, he did not have time to cover up the remains. When he was wounded and captured, and then escaped to see it again, General Li's remains were gone. He only found a talisman and a belt that General Li had worn during his lifetime.</p>
<p>He pointed to a patch of blood on the ground and a pile of hair and said, "This is the last relic that General Li can give people." Saying that, he temporarily buried the blood-soaked soil and messy hair underground. I bowed my head and stared at the mound of yellow sand, wishing the general eternal rest!</p>
<p>Like a storm, it came quickly and went quickly. Kaifeng returned to peace from the storm. Shops opened, public institutions returned, and there were more pedestrians on the sidewalks... Chairman Liu Maoen had a long conversation with the reporter by candlelight on the night of the recovery of Kaifeng. He said: Relief is the first priority after the recovery. The provincial capital will never move elsewhere. We must strive for survival in the ruins. When I flew by military plane to Zheng on the afternoon of the 27th, I saw the bright national flag flying over the city of Bian in the sunlight, and realized that Kaifeng tomorrow will surely move towards a new life in hardship!</p>

<h3>Map of the Flooded City of Fuzhou</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>[Fuzhou Dispatch] Every year, the people of Fuzhou worry about the arrival of the "Guan Di Knife Sharpening Water" on the thirteenth day of the fifth month (lunar calendar). On that day, the water always rises and floods the land. This time, however, the water began to rise two days earlier (June 17th) at 10 PM. By dawn on the 18th, the raging, muddy waves had taken over the entire city. Areas that had never flooded before were flooded this time. In the Taijiang district, Sanbao, Shangshu Temple, and Damao Street; in Yizhou, Hubuqian, and Wenzao Mountain; in the Cangshan district, Longjiao, Wanpu Mound, and Sheren Temple; in the Dagen district, Erqiao Pavilion, Jindou Bridge, and Nanmendou; and in the Gulou district, Hongshan Bridge Street – in these low-lying areas, the water level was over thirteen feet. In the areas of Yizhou and Shangshu Temple, the water level was even over twenty feet. Even in areas like Shengfu Road and Dongjiekou, there were raging waves of over three or four feet.</p>
<p>Overlooking the City from Nando Temple</p>
<p>In order to understand the water situation in the entire city, the reporter braved the rain and climbed to the Nando Temple on the top of Yu Mountain. Standing at the highest point of the mountain, I looked out over the entire city and the LinSen county boundary within sight. As the saying goes, "The higher the mountain, the smaller the world." When people's horizons expand, they can often feel refreshed and broad-minded. But under this unprecedented disaster, the wider my view, the heavier my heart became. From Yizhou and Hongshan Bridge in the far west, Sanxian Isle in the southwest, Shangdu Road in the far south, and Yazu Island and Kangshan in the far east, except for Ping Mountain in the far north, everything was submerged in the turbulent yellow water. Everywhere was a vast expanse of water, with muddy waves reaching the sky. I couldn't find a single complete house, only countless rooftops and treetops floating in the raging waves. They trembled, floated, and were in danger of being swallowed up at any moment. Looking beyond the Min River to Kuiqi Majiang, this desolate scene of a flooded land continued to extend.</p>
<p>Wading Through Waist-Deep Water to Ask About the Disaster</p>
<p>The reporter braved the waist-deep water to visit the disaster area. However, in this turbulent torrent, the distance one could travel by wading was indeed very limited. Although there were many boats and rafts coming and going on the street, most were chartered at high prices, either for leisure or for rescuing disaster victims. Those out for leisure naturally wouldn't allow "idlers" to wade, and those rescuing victims couldn't allow reporters to increase their load and reduce the chances of the disaster victims escaping.</p>
<p>In the places the reporter passed, countless refugees were waiting for the final rescue with desperate eyes. Most of them were huddled in attics, their hungry and terrified faces peeking out from the window cracks, hoping someone would offer them a spoonful of watery porridge to quench their hunger or a helping hand. But they were also afraid of rafts or boats approaching, constantly issuing almost ferocious warnings to those who came, because those houses that were already floating would be completely destroyed with the slightest wave-induced collision.</p>
<p>Those who could hide in the attic were already fortunate. Most people didn't have an attic to shelter in. In the middle of the night, the water suddenly rose. There was no way to escape. How could they avoid this unprecedented catastrophe when they had no experience in their lives? They could only temporarily find some door panels or the like to tie into rafts, allowing the whole family to float on the water, trembling and not daring to move for the whole day, and not daring to sleep for a moment throughout the long night.</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Killed by Crushing and Drowning</p>
<p>In the city area, from Sunlaoying, Shanhua Fang, Cheng Bian Cao, Dazhong Temple, and Daming Road, almost no mud-walled house was complete. Everywhere was a scene of rubble. Most of the wooden houses were left with only a shell. Large sections of the provincial government's walls on the south and west sides collapsed, and parts of the Social Affairs Department, Finance Department, Education Department, and Civil Affairs Department also collapsed.</p>
<p>In Yijin Lane, nine out of ten houses collapsed. The outer walls of the Western-style house of Inspector Yang all collapsed. Numerous disaster victims whose houses had been flooded were desperately digging through the remains, moving whatever furniture and boxes were left. The situation in Wenru Lane was even worse. There were mostly big houses there, but the collapse of the big houses was even more severe. In the house of Gan Lianquan, the navy captain and descendant of Gan Guobao, the nine-door admiral of number 70, fifteen members of his family, including his nephew's wife and nieces, would have all perished if it hadn't been for the help of dozens of students from the neighborhood who rescued nine of them. But only three corpses were dug out of the three daughters, one son, and two children buried inside. In Guanglu Lane and Cangqian Street, ten out of ten houses collapsed. None were spared. There was only a difference in the degree of collapse. No one was spared. The situation on Chating Road was simply unbearable to look at. From number 141 to number 181, the wooden houses and the Nanshi Primary School, Chating Xima Dou Nan Fire Brigade, all had only empty shells, and everything was washed away. Electric poles lay scattered all over the ground, and several bridges had completely collapsed. The situation on Hujie Road was a complete mess. Antai Bridge, Jibi Lane, Guizhi Lane, Zhuzi Lane, Daoshan Road, Nanmendou, Zhongzhou, Shangdu, Longtan Corner, Yizhou, Shangshu Temple Hubu Qian, Wenzao Mountain... countless disaster areas, most of the fronts were still intact, but inside there was no place to stand. Although there were not many collapses on Xiahang Road, most of Fuzhou's treasures – sugar, fertilizer powder, and cement – were flooded. Other merchandise might still be able to retain some capital, but these were completely damaged. According to general estimates, tens of thousands of houses have collapsed, and at least a thousand people have been crushed and drowned. More than 200,000 people have been affected by the disaster, and the loss of property and materials may reach more than 40 to 50 trillion. How long will it take for Fuzhou, which is under this unprecedented disaster, to recover?</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Medium Indica Rice Almost Vanished from the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the food rice market transaction, due to the limited price of 20 million, upper and middle indica rice almost disappeared. Only the earliest second-class early rice was transacted at the limited price. Milled indica rice also reached 20 million, the market price of the upper white indica rice was 22.2 million, the middle one was 21.15 million, the high thin rice and the yang indica rice were uniformly priced at 22.2 million, and the early rice was 20.5 million, each of which was 1 million higher than the previous day. Yinyuan white and yuancheng middle grades were both transacted at 20 million. A total of 4,780 dan of goods arrived in the market from the north and south.</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the manufacturer allocated various brands of flour for actual sales in this street. The price was 6.2 million, 29 bags per household, for a total of 7,560 bags, but the supply was still insufficient to meet the demand. On the one hand, the price of wheat was high, and the price of flour in other ports had increased, so people's hearts were firm and the price outside the market rose again. Lao Che was 7.2 million, and Bingchuan was 7 million, each rising by 500,000 to 600,000. Wheat bran rose by 150,000, and wheat was 5.5 million.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: The price increased across the board. Soybeans were scarce in both arrival and storage, and the cost was high, so they continued to rise by 1 million. Hankou Zha beans were transacted at 11.1 million, 1 million higher than the limited price. Mung beans were selling very well in this street, and high-quality goods were priced 1 million higher. Broad beans rose by 400,000 to 500,000. New and old corn were not connected, and the supply was short, so the price increased sharply. Qidong corn rose by 4 million, and red sorghum was priced very high. Mingguang red sorghum was 10.5 million, and sesame was increased by another 2 million. Raw peanuts saw stagnation in sales to the south and were uniquely 1 million lower.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Due to the lack of raw materials and high soybean prices, the market situation increased. Various oil factories tried to supply soybean oil at a price of 45 million. Zhongzhi Factory and Dasheng Factory tried to open rapeseed oil at 43 million, which was as high as the limited price. Raw oil was also transacted at the limited price of 60 million, each rising by 1 million to 2 million. Xiao Che sesame oil rose by 2 million to close at 60.15 million. Soybean cake initially opened at 4.8 million, but later fell to 4.7 million due to less supply than demand, which was the same as yesterday.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Were Dull</h3>
<p>Although the main sellers of red and green tea yesterday wanted to hoard goods, the transactions did not become active due to the reluctance of the street and rural buyers to offer prices for domestic sales of various types of tea. As for export tea, exporters are also organizing the goods that have been processed in the past few days to catch up with the shipping schedule of the ship sailing to the Philippines on the 18th of this month, so they have no intention of rushing to accept the goods. Therefore, the market situation is circuitous and slightly firm, and there is no major change compared to before.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Requests to Purchase Shaanxi Cotton</h3>
<p>Sui Office Cables Shaanxi Provincial Government Requesting Issuance of Purchasing Certificates for Yusha Factory</p>
<p>[Chongqing Dispatch from this Newspaper on the 8th] The Sui Office cabled the Shaanxi Provincial Government on the 8th, requesting that purchasing certificates be issued to the Yusha Factory before the new cotton is put on the market to purchase 18,000 dan of Shaanxi cotton. A total of 9,000 dan in Shashi, 2,700 dan each for Shenxin and Yuhua, and 4,500 dan for Yufeng. Also, before receiving a reply from the Shaanxi Provincial Government, cotton stored in the Chongqing market and the China Textile Company cotton will be uniformly prohibited from entering Sichuan, and each factory will purchase it at market prices.</p>
<h3>Rubber Industry Association Requests Restriction on Imports of Rubber Products</h3>
<p>The Rubber Products Industry Association of this city, in view of the fact that the authorities are too lenient in restricting the import of rubber products, 40% of the foreign exchange obtained by the rubber industry in the quarterly quota of the Import and Export Administration Commission is finished products, while the real rubber raw materials are only 60%. This phenomenon is not only a major blow to the development of the rubber industry, but also a major waste of the government's foreign exchange. In the past, it has repeatedly listed facts and requested the government to change the current policy, but there have been no concrete results. Recently, the industry has become increasingly aware that the foreign exchange reserves are dwindling, and the raw materials needed by various industries are in urgent need. Therefore, it has once again listed the advantages and disadvantages and submitted them to the Import and Export Administration Commission, requesting that, except for aircraft and small car tires that are not yet produced domestically, all other finished products should be prohibited from import from the sixth season's import quota. The foreign exchange used for the import of finished products in the past will be used to purchase raw materials to maintain the production of various factories and save foreign exchange expenditures.</p>
<h3>Silver Market Trended Towards Relaxation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market in this city trended towards relaxation. The four banks and one bureau reported another difference in the clearing of bills, with a total difference of 709.7 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a difference of 852.8 billion, the Bank of China had a difference of 511.5 billion, the Bank of Communications had a difference of 672.4 billion, the Farmers Bank had a difference of 61.8 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a difference of 9.1 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had a difference of 39.4 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a difference of 92.5 billion. The large clearing difference of commercial banks was 658.5 billion, the small clearing difference was 645 billion, and the total clearing difference of foreign banks was 696.2 billion.</p>
<h3>Credit Cooperative Checks are Not Allowed to Participate in Clearing</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Gold Control Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that the checks issued by various credit cooperatives are in conflict with the provisions of Article 123 of the Negotiable Instruments Law and should not be accepted. In addition to notifying the three industry associations of banking, money, and trust to comply with the order, the bureau also notified the bill clearing house yesterday that checks issued by credit cooperatives are not allowed to participate in clearing.</p>
<h3>People's Hearts are Scattered and Not Much is Opened; Fine Yarn Prices See Squeezing and Small; Many Cotton Cloth Sellers are Narrowly Rising and Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the authorities' cancellation of day-to-day transactions to avoid risks, brokers in the cotton yarn market successively withdrew, and the police in the market were still strictly monitoring, people's hearts were scattered, and activities were delayed until after 12 o'clock. As a result, various grades of popular yarns of 42 counts were rarely opened. Blue Phoenix closed at 980 million, falling back by 20 million. Only one grade of 40 counts, Blue Phoenix, was 950 million. 32 counts of Silver Moon were 915 million, squeezing small by 25 million. Day-to-day 21 counts of Shuangma came out with a squeeze of 10 million lower. Only a small number of 20 counts, such as Shuangdiqiu, Jincheng, and Tiannv Duobao House, were opened, and the market also fell. 16 counts of Benteng were transacted at 660 million, squeezing up 10 million. 16 counts and other coarse yarns were rarely opened. Only copy factories and guest groups slightly absorbed them throughout the day, with 39 orders, totaling 113 pieces.</p>
<p>In another dispatch: The China Textile Yarn Management Committee threw out 185 pieces of yarn yesterday and sold 23,870 pieces of cloth and 430 quilts. The two items of cloth and quilts alone recovered 597,896,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation: due to the emergency of checking warehouses, the inspection of the bills of various banks was also strict, the capital turnover in the industry was still tight, and it was the time for the sale of textiles and constructions, so all parties were selling more. Except for Sichuan and Hankou gangs in the market who slightly added to the original wool fabric, the northern gangs and the bank owners still had more supply than demand. As a result, 12-pound Longtou B-shaped fine cloth squeezed well by 300,000, and the Four Gentlemen original wool fabric also rose by 300,000. The market price of other cloths fluctuated narrowly.</p>
<p>In another dispatch: Textile Construction Company tendered 12-pound Wufu fine cloth, Four Gentlemen original wool fabric Poplin, Ruyi bleached cloth, Jumping Carp Electric Light Twill, etc., totaling 12 kinds, and one kind of 68×86 colored floral quilt. It is heard that the price filled out by cloth merchants applying for Wufu fine cloth is about 24 million to 420 million yuan, and the price filled out for Four Gentlemen original wool fabric is 26 million to 620 million yuan, with dye factories applying for the most.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Yarn Management Committee recently considered that the quantity of Hankou raw cotton that can be purchased is still huge. At the same time, taking into account the flexibility of the capital turnover of Hankou cotton merchants who purchased a large amount of raw cotton, after the last committee meeting, it was resolved that, for a period of one month, each entrusted cotton purchasing merchant will be allowed to receive 80% of the loan from this association with the cotton transportation bill of lading. The association has yesterday telegraphed the Hankou Cotton Merchant Purchasing Cotton Joint Venture Office to inform them of this.</p>
<h3>Commercial Situation in Various Places</h3>
<p>Suzhou: [Suzhou Dispatch from this Newspaper on the 8th] Rice prices in Suzhou today have increased by 1 million yuan across the board. The market can trade coarse japonica rice for 19 million yuan, second-class white rice for 20.5 million yuan, and door rice is priced at 20.9 million yuan. The dark plate price of upper white rice is around 23-24 million yuan. Also, in order to control prices, the Suzhou County Government has resolutely banned the flour market today, causing chaotic selling prices, which are about 7.2 million yuan or more.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: [Zhenjiang Dispatch from this Newspaper on the 8th] The Zhenjiang Price Evaluation Council today approved the price increase of pork to 420,000 yuan per catty, tofu to 20,000 yuan per piece, and hotels, barbershops, and bathhouses to increase by 80% of the original price.

<h3>Silver Market Was Loose and Excessively Liquid in the Afternoon; Chinese Stocks Turned Upward Near the Close</h3>

Chinese wingers He Yingfen and Li Dahui broke through the enemy's line and repeatedly shot, but the new team's goalkeeper Ai Gen was quite calm and defused the danger by saving the ball. After eight minutes, the new team took advantage of the Chinese team's rear emptiness and launched a sneak attack. New team winger Huo Meng scored a goal with a pass from center forward Peng Song, which was as fast as lightning. Two minutes later, Zhu Yongqiang took advantage of the new team's left full-back Sapp reb's defense and returned a goal, tying the score.

A few minutes later, a Chinese team player fouled in the penalty area and was penalized with a 25-yard free kick. New team left winger Qiu Xi kicked the ball into the net, and the new team took the lead with 3-2. Before long, Zhu Yongqiang dribbled straight in and scored a goal near the goal, tying the score at 3-3 in the first half.

<h3>Three Australian Female Talents; Hopeful for the World Games; Hurdles, Sprint, Long Jump</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London Communication] Among the thirty-five athletes from Australia attending the current World Games in London, three are female athletes, namely Shelley Strickland (Western Australia), Joyce King (New South Wales), and Judith Condell (Sydney).</p>
<p>Strickland is tall, has blonde hair, and has a beautiful demeanor. Australians regard her as a very promising athlete in the World Games. In the Australian Games in January this year, her 100-yard hurdles race was equivalent to the world record of 11.6 seconds. That race was run on grass, and her compatriots believe that she will run better on the cinder track of the World Games and may even perform as well as Marlene Cadena (England) and Mrs. Blankers-Koen (Netherlands) in the 80-meter hurdles race.</p>
<p>Miss Strickland is 24 years old this year and is a mathematics lecturer at a university. She participated in sports competitions for the first time when she was a freshman at the University of Western Australia. At that time, she almost won every competition for freshman girls. As a result of her training with male athletes, there has been an improvement in the time and distance of each event.</p>
<p>Last year, when Australia held the National Lotus Games, she won five championships. In this year's sports games, she won the hurdles championship. In the two sprint finals, she was only second to Joyce King. Miss Strickland was taught by her father, Dave Strickland, who was once known as a famous sprinter in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Joyce King is a 27-year-old school teacher who won the Australian 100-yard championship in 11 seconds. Because she ran on grass that had just rained, her performance in this World Games is bound to improve. She participated in the 220-yard race and set a new Australian record of 24.9 seconds.</p>
<p>Judith Condell is a female student who won the Australian women's long jump championship with 18 feet 5 inches. She is 16 years old this year and is 5 feet 6 inches tall. She is one of Australia's famous female athletes in the future.</p>

<h3>British Attend World Games; Full Lineup Announced for Male and Female Track and Field Athletes; Many Famous Athletes Among Them</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London Communication] The list of male and female athletes who will participate in the main track and field events of the British World Games has been announced.</p>
<p>Men's Team</p>
<p>100 meters, Pelay or Echar McColl Gaudel Jones. 200 meters, McColl Gaudel Fargrave Weili. 400 meters, Roberts Li Huis Bufu. 800 meters, Barrid Tella Huai Wilder. 1,500 meters, Nanjivili Malles Wilson or Parker. 5,000 meters, Alnai Rockets Bruton. 10,000 meters, Cox Peter McKok. 110-meter hurdles, Brier Bakwei Finley or Wilderless. 400-meter hurdles, Federal Ainsworth. 3,000-meter steeplechase, Coley Tudor Howell. 10,000-meter race walking, Quchal Malles Wester. 50-kilometer race walking, Wilderlock Lloyd Xiang Sheng Martin New.

<p>Strength Perspective</p>
<p>The candidate for the leader has not yet been officially appointed, because Finley, a fighter pilot who has repeatedly made great achievements during the war, has injured leg muscles. If he can recover in time, he will be appointed. He is still the fastest high-hurdle athlete in the world. In the 1932 World Games, he participated in the 110-meter final and won fourth place. Four years later, he won the runner-up in the World Games held in Berlin. If Finley's leg injury cannot be healed by then, Roberts will most likely serve as the leader. Roberts is the British athlete participating in the 400 meters. Pelay, the record holder for British sprint, will only participate in the 100-meter race, which may surprise people, because he stopped training due to a leg injury in the summer, so he chose the one he is best at. He has made great progress in recent weeks. McColl Gaudel, 22, is an excellent sprinter, and he is likely to win the 100-meter and 110-meter races. Barrid, a 23-year-old student at an art school in London, may also be listed among the world's winners. Harras, the record holder for New Zealand, is a world-class athlete in the half-mile race. Nanjivili is a strong opponent in the 1,500 meters. If Finley can recover, he will definitely take the lead in the 110-meter hurdles final. Brer, only 18 years old, is a British athlete participating in the 110-meter hurdles. He won the race in 15.1 seconds. He is still studying and is the youngest athlete in the UK. Qiu Char participated in the 10,000-meter race walking and broke the world record in recent weeks of practice. The record held by high jumper Babison is 6 feet 2 inches. Pole vaulter Webster ranked sixth in the last Berlin World Games and can maintain a record of 13 feet 6 inches. Horting is a marathon long-distance runner and is one of the most promising people in the British men's team. Hammer thrower Clark is also an outstanding person. The most outstanding people in the women's team are Mrs. Jordan in the 100 meters, Miss Cheeseman in the 200 meters, and Miss Cadena, who participated in the 80-meter hurdles, and recently set a new world record of 11.2 seconds. Mrs. Taylor participated in the high jump in the last World Games and won the runner-up.</p>

<h3>Mr. Hu Puan's First Anniversary Memorial</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Puan passed away at 3:35 AM on July 9th of last year. Today marks the first anniversary. Remembering our past friendship, I cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>I had known Mr. Puan for twenty years, but we did not meet often. Our most frequent conversations occurred in the year before his death, and between 1933 and 1935 when he taught at Zhengfeng College (now renamed Chengming College). I will focus on these two periods.</p>
<p>In 1933, I began lecturing on Western History at Zhengfeng College, where Mr. Puan was also the Dean of Academics. At the same time, he also taught at Chizhi College and Jinan University, relying solely on a chartered car for transportation, rushing around all day (Chizhi was in Jiangwan, Jinan in Zhenru). A man who had served as the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department for two years, yet could not live without teaching, shows his character. During this period, I had frequent conversations with him, and was able to glimpse his scholarship. His method of learning was to first build up his own knowledge, as a foundation for handling affairs. He used writing as a tool for application, and reading as the basis for being a person. He focused on the doctrines of Gu Tinglin, Huang Lizhou, Wang Chuanshan, and Yan Xizhai. His initial approach was greatly influenced by the scholarship of Dai Dongyuan and Duan Wangcai. According to Mr. Puan, he was unwilling to be a scholar who only did textual research, but believed that to read Chinese books, one must start with textual research. Therefore, in addition to the four gentlemen Gu, Huang, Wang, and Yan, he added Dai and Duan as standards for learning. After reading the books of Dai and Duan, he realized that the tool of textual research lies in exegesis, and the foundation of exegesis lies in phonology. This was roughly the scope of his reading and personal conduct.</p>
<p>In July of the year before last (1946), after the school summer vacation began, Mr. Puan suddenly sent me a letter, wanting me to work at the Municipal Gazetteer Office (now renamed Shanghai Municipal Archives Committee). Although I intended to accept, I delayed going. Mr. Puan sent another letter urging me, and set a date to accompany me to the office. His sincerity towards friends was unmatched. I arrived at the office on August 1, 1946 (and left this March, having been there for one year and seven months). During breaks, I was able to talk with Mr. Puan often. At lunch, I saw him eat only a few fragrant olives, or a few slices of bread. I said that he was eating too little, and that the nutrition was insufficient, which might harm his health. Mr. Puan said, "Since Japan launched the Pacific War, I knew that food would become a problem, so I gradually reduced my food intake. Now, I only eat a small bowl of rice, and a little bit of vegetables for each meal. Although I eat less, I still read and write every day, and my spirit is the same." He also said, "Recently, I sleep on a chair, without going to bed. I get up before dawn, write more than a thousand words, and read several pages of books, before going to the office." From this, we can see that Mr. Puan was a strong-willed person, who could conquer matter with spirit.</p>
<p>Mr. Puan also taught Chinese Literature for the A group at the Law and Politics College. Two months before his death, his liver disease worsened. He wanted me to substitute for him, and I couldn't refuse. So, I lectured on his book "A Brief Discussion on Articles Throughout the Dynasties." The lecture notes mentioned "Three Ancestors," "Seven Scholars," "Zhengshi," "Yan Xu," etc. Even in his illness, he still annotated their origins. I substituted for Mr. Puan at the Law and Politics College for two weeks, until the end of the semester. Mr. Puan taught for decades, and I unexpectedly concluded his last course. This is also something unforgettable.</p>
<p>In April 1939, Mr. Puan suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. Although the treatment was effective, his left hand and left foot were unable to move from then on. [Editor's note: When Mr. Ye Chucang passed away in Shanghai the year before last, I met Mr. Puan at the funeral home. At that time, he could walk slowly. However, when viewing the layout of the mourning hall, he stumbled and almost fell. I rushed forward to support him, and took him to rest by the hall. Mr. Puan sat there silently, with tears in his eyes. This scene is as if it were happening right now, and Mr. Puan has already passed away! Reading Mr. Yixian's article to this point, I cannot help but feel deeply moved.] He still continued to read every day. His right hand could write. During the several years of his illness, he wrote several works of "Zhou Yi Ancient History View." In the year of his death, he wrote the booklet "The Road of Youth." Students who obtained it, all revered it as a treasure. Last July, I had a eulogy couplet for Mr. Puan, claiming that I still truly knew him as a person. It is recorded below, and used to conclude this article.</p>
<p>"He aspired to clarity early, but his talent was never fully developed. Returning from officialdom, he was still a poor scholar. Even now, his integrity is firm, and his noble demeanor corrects shallow customs.</p>
<p>Only with a stubborn personality, he had many regrets with the world. Now that you have passed away, who else knows you? It is not just that a teacher is hard to find, but that the students have lost their guidance."</p>
<h3>Inscription on Mr. Yu's Copy of "Returning Bamboo" Painting</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>The ink bamboo painting was painted by Mr. Gui Zhuang (Yuangong) and given to Lu Anqing. The wind and rain are raging, each expressing its extreme state. At that time, the Ming Dynasty had already collapsed. The gentleman returned from Taihu Lake and created it in an ancient temple in Wuxing, with a detailed inscription. The inscription also includes nine sacrificial poems for loyalty, dedicated to Liu Niantai, Qi Jiabiao, and the late Zhongmin (諱邦曜) and other gentlemen. At the end of the scroll, there are also five quatrains of five characters each by Gu Tinglin mourning Yuangong, with many taboo words, so they were not included in the original edition. Yu Yueyuan of Longyou once imitated it, and left it to Mr. He Yangling, which I inscribed for remembrance. Now, the desolate clouds have set, the moon has fallen, and both the person and the music are fragrant. Thinking of it fills my chest with pain!</p>
<p>Red lanterns overhead annotate the Six Secret Teachings, with hands shielding mountains and rivers and white clouds soaring high. As long as a section embodies loyalty and love, paper and ink communicate spiritually, even in dreams, it is a laborious task.</p>
<p>This bamboo, like a person, has a clear backbone, silently embracing foolish love. Who will be its friend three hundred years later? Only a poetic beard walking under the moon.</p>
<p>White hair, spring lamp, and ink sea are deep. Ice flowers copied are worth a thousand gold. One oddity is truly comparable to a complete history, in which there is a solitary scholar with a steadfast heart.</p>
<p>Once inscribed with a brush of frost on the Huai River bank, I embrace the creek rattan and enter long dreams. I offer clear lament as if eating wheat rice, no need for wind and dew to bow to Gui Zhuang.</p>
<p>Endless moaning in the reeds by the river, even more painting ten thousand bamboos expressing mournful sounds. A scholar's foolish indignation, I can recognize, stealing a breath in the world, watching the sinking of the nation.</p>
<p>Drunk and silent, ink tears flowing, deciding to offer heads to sacrificial poems for loyalty. It's hard to distinguish between the previous dynasty and the current era. Letting my hair down and asking the sky for a moment.</p>
<p>Layers of waves contain "eternal sorrow," (name of a tune composed by Yuangong) the remaining water of the Zhu family, the Lu family's building. Unable to grow a thousand feet overnight, cut it into a flute to blow to the top of my head.</p>
<p>Whether merchants, monks, or drinkers, heroes are all old Jianghu. Who dies first to be buried by the blue sky, just look at the rootless ink bamboo painting.</p>
<p>The lake waves sob, the setting sun burns, only mourn for the remnants of the previous dynasty in the wilderness. I am Tinglin, I should cry bitterly, regretting the lack of righteousness to escape from Kunshan.</p>
<p>Past events are clearly unbearable, poetry and writing cannot save a dying nation. High sky, short hat, dying with a sword across, ultimately better than getting drunk in a field near Taihu Lake.</p>
<h3>Concert on Xuanwu Lake</h3>
<p>— Qiao Long</p>
<p>It is the height of summer again, but this year there is still no news of the Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra holding its summer evening weekend outdoor concerts.</p>
<p>Last week, I went to Nanjing and happened to attend a summer weekend performance by the Capital China Symphony Orchestra at the Cuizhou open-air concert hall on Xuanwu Lake at the invitation of a friend. The experience was quite good.</p>
<p>After the capital was relocated to Nanjing, there were two symphony orchestras that came back from Chongqing. One belonged to the Lizi Society and mostly performed for foreign guests; the other was the China Symphony Orchestra led and conducted by Mr. Lin Shengxi. At that time, although there was a magnificent open-air concert stage near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, the journey was too far after all, and the summer open-air concerts were all in the evening, so the transportation problem was difficult to solve, making regular performances impossible.</p>
<p>In the second year after the victory, after discussions by the municipal government and other relevant parties, it was considered that Cuizhou on Xuanwu Lake was very ideal: not far from the city center, and without the noise of vehicles and horses. However, there was still no funding for building an indoor concert hall. As a second best option, the open-air stage that is currently used for performances was built.</p>
<p>The style of the stage is similar to that in Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai, but the one there is wider and can accommodate a symphony orchestra of more than sixty people. The lighting equipment is also ideal. The stage is semi-spherical, standing on the ground, with the back covered with lead sheets, reflecting the sunlight, adding a lot of brilliance to Xuanwu Lake at sunset.</p>
<p>This year's summer weekend open-air concerts are the first performances since the completion of the concert stage. The schedule includes eight weeks, from May 23rd to July 11th, postponed in case of rain. However, unfortunately, it started with two rainy weekends in a row, so it was effectively delayed by two weeks. The ticket price is 30,000 yuan per show, which is really too cheap.</p>
<p>The content of the music is both high in quality and quantity. Each time, it starts at 7:45 PM and lasts until around 9:30 PM. The first week included Beethoven's Eroica Symphony, Schubert's Rosamunde Overture, Haydn's Dances, etc.</p>
<p>The China Symphony Orchestra was established in the wartime capital during the Anti-Japanese War. The entire team has better talent in stringed instruments, and the wind instruments are relatively poor, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>Every weekend afternoon, I rowed a boat on Xuanwu Lake (the boats there are especially cheap, only 100,000 yuan for two hours), and at about seven o'clock, I bought a ticket and sat on the grass in front of the concert stage (there are no chairs there, and a mat is issued with the ticket). When the concert starts, the sun has not yet set. At this time, a touch of afterglow reflects the sky, the city walls, and the lake. Watching the evening birds returning to the forest, the summer heat gradually dissipates, truly a summer scene on the lake. When the concert is over, if there is a moon, I look for a small boat in the moonlight and row back to the city; if there is no moonlight, I walk home along the faint lights on the Cuihong Causeway. It is truly an ideal weekend pastime in the city. Ling Yu</p>
<h3>Eccentricities of Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Xian Yu</p>
<p>British scholar Dr. Johnson, the founder of the English dictionary, was highly respected. However, he opposed using teaspoons. No matter how dirty his fingers were, he always used his hands to stir the sugar in his lemon tea.</p>
<p>American literary giant Hawthorne deliberately wrote his calligraphy in a bizarre style during his student days, in order to "look like a writer." After his death, some of his manuscripts could not be printed for many years because no one could read them.</p>
<p>Jurist Holmes had many quirks, one of which was writing letters while standing. When someone asked him why he didn't sit down to write, he said that sitting down to write letters would make them too long.</p>
<h3>Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>The times have allowed people to understand more common sense of economics. For example, the cost of living index. Before the victory, most people felt that this "new term" was unfamiliar, but now it is a household name, and even newspaper boys can recite it fluently. It is reported that the boatmen rowing on the Huangpu River have also adjusted their wages according to the cost of living index.</p>
<p>Difficult times have brought about the "index problem." The more the index is valued, and the more it becomes a problem, the more the economy declines.</p>
<p>The index in China today has one characteristic: it only goes up, and is unwilling to lag behind. In fact, the "index" should be renamed "price increase number."</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the index has two wonderful points:</p>
<p>First, the index clearly comes from prices, but merchants change their prices based on the index. In the world, nothing is more illogical than this.</p>
<p>Second, the compilation of the index clearly has a certain formula and method, and there is only one answer. However, in reality, it can be discussed in meetings and bargained over. Nothing is more ridiculous than this!</p>
<h3>Giraffe</h3>
<p>— He Dao</p>
<p>In European and American circuses or zoos, giraffes are one of the most popular animals, but unfortunately, our zoos do not have giraffes.</p>
<p>The giraffe's personality is extremely gentle and docile, and it can sometimes be bitten by cats. However, when it is angry, it can also kill a pair of lions with one kick.</p>
<p>People who raise giraffes mostly like to adopt young deer. Grown-up giraffes are too tall (eighteen feet) to be transported by train.</p>
<p>Although the giraffe's head and neck are long, it does not make any sound. Moreover, it can go without drinking water for several weeks, like a camel.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Hull's memoirs describe the intricate relations in Europe between the two World Wars: "France hoped that Germany's strength would be below it, and could not agree to any method that approached equality in German military equipment. On the other hand, Britain did not like France occupying a high and commanding position on the mainland, and hoped to create a balance of power in Europe, so that its own strength could become the decisive factor." This is a record of facts, not only a record of a period, but also a record of Britain's traditional national policy. This old British national policy was established by Wolsey, the first strategist of Henry VIII. In view of the past failures in military management on the European continent, he insisted on the belief of maintaining a balance of power without war, as the most economical self-defense strategy, which had considerable reasons both geographically and historically. Britain is an island nation outside the continent, surrounded by the sea. Sea power is developed, the navy is superior, and water transportation extends to all corners of the world. Territories in all continents of the world are covered with the "rice" character flag, which is enough to dominate the world, and there is no need to occupy a part of the European continent, nor is it possible. However, if the European continent is dominated by one country, the three islands bordering the sea will feel a great threat.</p>
<p>In terms of historical geography, the continental countries of Europe are always dominated by France, which is also closest to Britain. During the Hundred Years' War in the fourteenth century and the Napoleonic Wars in the nineteenth century, the British mainland was repeatedly on the verge of danger. There has long been a historical fact that two tigers cannot coexist. Germany and France are also age-old enemies. After the Great War and Napoleon, William, who advocated militarism, greatly dreamed of his world empire, greatly developed the navy, and managed maritime power, competing with the "Sea King" of Britain for hegemony, making enemies on all sides, and recklessly engaging in military affairs, which led to the First European War. Britain and France were in the same situation of interests, jointly resisted Germany, and all the Allied countries worked together to defeat the William Empire. After Germany surrendered, France suddenly raised its head high again. Clemenceau, the so-called "Tiger Prime Minister," looked down on everything and regarded himself as the master of the victorious country. President Wilson's Fourteen Points were invalid, and Prime Minister George was also suppressed, feeling uneasy in his heart. France's conditions for Germany were harsh, although for prevention, Britain was again worried about France's dominance on the mainland. Therefore, it indulged the German side, gradually promoted and supported it, in order to control it, which was still the old trick of the "balance of power" on the mainland policy. But unexpectedly, Hitler rose, recklessly worked hard, was unreasonable, and progressed with every step, becoming more prosperous with every reward. The Second World War eventually broke out. From this point of view, the old British "balance of power policy" and "non-war doctrine," although an economical calculation, also had the bitter truth of being difficult to get cheap.</p>
