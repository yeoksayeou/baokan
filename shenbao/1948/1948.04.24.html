<h3>副總統初選情形</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕廿三日選舉副總統大會於上午九時半開始，主席宣布開會後，首由秘書長洪蘭友報吿，此次副總統選舉，均係依照總統·副總統選舉罷免法第四條第五條之規定及總統副總統選舉投票開票辦法辦理，反覆說明，歷廿分鐘，除請預先抽定之選舉監察員分別執行監察發票外，並請主席團推定之于斌·于學忠·蘇挺三人監視啓封選票，以昭鄭重。十時零五分時，一切布置就緒，洪秘書長即宣布關閉會堂所有正門及邊門，禁止出入，至十時十分時，開始投票，樓上·樓下仍分別發票選舉，因事前已有週密準備，投票時秩序井然，進行甚為順利，僅樓下投票時，有女職員工啓基立於投票匭前，王代表維之及另一代表投票時，均將票上所圈者為何人令王見及，引起廣東代表一片吼聲，將該女職員吼出會場，中間一度引起片刻騷動，惟王退出後即趨於平靜。投票歷一小時，於十一時十三分時完畢。休息廿分鐘後，十一時半縱續開會，賡即進行開票程序，於十一時五十分由監察員啓封票匭，即開始唱票，由大會文書組副組長王恩喬任唱票員，監察員則立於其旁，唱後即交由計票員統計票數，每開一匭唱完後，即作一初步統計，明示於電化計票器上，唱票時，每遇連唱數人姓名時，會塲中輙響起一片掌聲。唱票之始，程潛·李宗仁均以優勢領先，至啓封至第八票匭時，孫科票數始於程潛票數接近，至啓封至第九票匭時，李宗仁則突以一百三十一票之數，造成五百六十七票之紀錄，第十票匭啓封後，孫科票數亦逐漸加多。至下午二時十分開票完畢，洪秘書長報吿本日計發票二七九〇張，投入票匭者共計二七八五張，其中作廢者廿三張，總計有效選舉共二七六〇張，主席戴傳賢於開票完成後宣布選舉結果，並報告依總統·副總統選舉罷免法之規定，定廿四日上午再行選舉，全場掌聲如雷，至二時廿五分，此一緊張熱烈之第一次副總統選舉戰，乃吿一初步段落。</p>
<h3>國大會外　一幕武劇</h3>
<p>救國日報昨被搗毁　衝突中六職員負傷</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕國大武劇層出不窮，副總統選舉之日，廣東代表及粵籍華僑代表竟將南京救國日報搗毁，且有數人負傷。緣副總統競選活動日趨激烈，各報紛為候選人宣傳，若干報紙持中立立場，若干報紙之言論則不免有所偏袒。救國日報連日所載文章，多攻擊孫科者，廿三日該報以社論地位刋載代論，題為「廣東代表不投孫科的票——一個廣東代表的來函聲明」，引起廣東代表之反感。廿三日上午十一時半，副總統選舉投票後，廣東代表及粵籍華僑代表即集合百數十人，分乘大會交通車兩輛，馳往太平路救國日報肚，欲覓社長龔德柏質問，因龔不在，發生衝突，救國日報營業部·社長室·遂被搗毁。廣東代表旋乘汽車赴曾公祠該報工廠，復將機器房排字房搗毁。十二時半，廣東代表在大會休息室二樓招待記者，報吿事件經過。據高信·沈哲臣等稱：彼等係前往同聲質詢，並索閱原稿，曾派張發奎·沈哲臣。唐耕誠代表交涉，救國日報職員竟予毆擊，遂發生衝突，混亂中該報似有損傷。救國日報社長龔德柏稱：出事時彼適外出，歸來後始知其事。該報負傷職員胡雲龍則謂：廣東代表衝進門後，即亂打亂搗，並無交涉情事。營業部搗毁後，彼等並以「打死」威脅兩工人引路，仍乘汽車咸往曾公祠工廠，時工廠已知報館被搗消息，當將中門用木柱頂住，該代表竟將中門衝破，機器房·排字房·切紙刀·電話等均毀壞無遺。據在場目擊之警士稱：救國日報於數日前接有恫嚇信，聲請保護，警局派警士廿人負責。今晨十一時五十分，廣東代表乘車而來，下車後即將報館包圍，若干人入內，若干人在外攔阻警土不准進入，並謂：你們維持外邊秩序，裏面的事我們負責。彼等旋乘車赴曾公祠，警士徒步趕往，及至，工廠已被搗毁，各代表猶未去，見警士趕到，乃謂：這裏亦交給你們了，始乘車而去，前後歷一小時。某警土且出其調查所得之負傷者名單，有救國日報職員劉希漢·胡雲龍·吳培元·沈俊容·張鑫生及工友呂玉凡等六人。該報被搗毁之情形甚慘，各室雜物零亂不堪，尤以排字房，所有字架均散亂，恐非一二日所能整理竣事。惟龔德柏宣稱：明日決仍設法出版。</p>
<h3>蘇聯駐華新大使　羅申即啟程東來</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿三日電〕蘇聯新任駐華大使羅申暨夫人即將赴華，渠等昨日已在我駐蘇大使館辦完護照簽證之手續。之糾紛，不應再於法方面費事，增加更棘手之糾紛。最後，一致決議提出審查意見，將該兩案呈復國府，關於國代部份，以為「依憲法規定區域代表名額無法增加，若於職業團體增加名額，補辦選舉，恐增糾紛，據請建議國府另行設法解決」。關於立委部份，則以「增加名額，其困難情形與上案相同，擬請建議國府，可依在選舉前國務會議決定之政黨提名補充辦法及本黨歷次關於提名之決議辦理」。此兩項審查報吿，將於廿四日提出第十次臨時會討論，俾有所決定。</p>

<h3>國代立委選舉補充辦法　立院提審查意見　交第十次臨時會討論再予決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕立院廿三日上午十一時廿分舉行第九次臨時會，孫科主席，討論廿二日國務會議通過之第一屆國代·立委選舉補充辦法，該兩項辦法係由國府令達立院遵照修正有關選舉法規者，然出席各委員包括民。靑兩黨委員，咸認運用立法程序解決政治問題之辦法有背法治精神，於此行憲伊始之際，期期以為不可，且增加職團名額補辦選舉困難殊多，候選人會籍問題其一，職團本身另提候選人問題其二，辦理選舉問題其三，控制票額問題其四，新增名額分配問題其五，是以該兩項辦法能否解決糾紛，息事寗人，使應當選者出來，固未可必，共引起更多糾紛，毀法蕩紀，則極具可能。譚惕吾並指出，補充辦法中各項規定旣不能使退讓糾紛盡數消除，而選舉拖時過久，難免不生枝節問題，尤其列席之規定更屬不偷不類，渠主張請政府以硬性確定原則，合乎法，無論如何得票多者當選，合乎情，政黨提名為正式候選人者亦作當選。張肇元亦稱：民主途中難免有錯，但明知已錯，不能錯上加錯，而致不可收拾，渠與狄膺等均主張先付審查，再作鄭重決定。孫科亦大體同意各委員見解，然以當局有意使此案在本次國大閉幕前合法成立，俾使立院合理集會，則行憲不受影響，另行建議，未嘗不可，但恐時間不許。立院原意國代部份國大可自行解決，然終又由立院討論，渠於報吿國務會議討論通過該案經過後，請各委員重加考慮，終以茲事體大，決定先開審查會後，再開大會討論，一時散會。四時復開全院審查會，劉克儁主席，呂復·陳茹玄·諶小岑等均對該兩案表示反對。呂復說明憲法與一般法規限制極嚴，立法方面實無法可想，應在糾紛緣起之黨政兩方尋求解決途徑。陳茹玄呼籲，立院結束在即，決不能臨了再知法犯法，貽笑遐邇，諶小岑則强調三週前渠曾提類似之建議，然以未便過問，而未討論，現是項問題拖延至今，國府此舉直如玩笑。渠指出對該兩案僅向國府呈復無法可想，或建議譚惕吾之辦法兩途，李慶　·史澤之復稱：如今祗有黨與政</p>
<h3>延安南下國軍抵甘泉　陜中戰事趨緊張　鄂西匪又蠢動已被擊退</h3>
<p>〔本報西安二十三日電〕自延安南下國軍，已抵甘泉縣城附近。據悉：隴東匪賀龍部動態殊堪注目，甘陝邊境之涇川東二十里有匪一大股竄擾，賀龍在環縣指揮，兵力集結中。渭河北岸匪第二縱隊王震一部，昨由武功縣境南渡至郿縣之常興鎭。又乾縣城西北及醴泉縣城北東北有接觸，犯乾北張家堡一帶之匪第五團，廿二日全被國軍消滅，麟遊守軍已轉移陣地。寶鷄國軍廿三日擊退西犯散匪一股。隴海鐵路絳帳與常興間（在武功與扶風縣間）被破壞，西行車廿三日僅開交通車至武功，其東之普集銀一度被襲。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶二十三日電〕陝南洵陽頃吿失陷，國軍與匪激戰於洵陽·安康兩縣邊境之母猪灘附近。另趙壽山匪股竄抵鎭安茅草坪。又鄂中股匪竄陷遠安（當陽以北）。</p>
<p>〔本報長沙廿三日電〕鄂西匪又蠢動，圖犯郝穴沙市。犯郝穴匪在距郝八華里處，經永濟軍艦數度砲擊潰退。犯沙市匪一度竄至距沙僅十五華里，亦經國軍地面部隊協同軍艦擊退。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿三日電〕鄂中大洪山區匪軍近又集結蠢動，此間空軍廿二日以强大編隊出動京山東北轟擊，斃匪二百餘，并毁匪軍工事大半。（尙有剿匪戰訊，刋二版）</p>
<h3>國大紀程　副總統選舉初賽</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕副總統的選舉競賽，今天在民主政治的運動場——國民大會堂裏，展開了初獻身手的競賽。與賽的六位候選人，似都各有充足的準備，不免給人「勢均力敵」的看法。淸晨，走向大會堂的途中，迎風招展的儘是各候選人的競選標語，各有千秋。會塲裏，每個角落裏，都飛舞着各色競選宣傳品，有的是張坦白的：「請你投一票」！最注目的，還是全副武裝，站在大會堂門首見人便招呼握手的李宗仁。還有李夫人郭德潔女士的可囑：「請你選李先生」！這也許有點成就，因為初賽結果是李宗仁獨佔鰲頭。</p>
<p>民主的試場</p>
<p>選舉副總統比選舉總統更熱烈，並且在熱烈裏顯出了充分的緊張：這場初賽的塲面，大會主席團推選了德高望重的考試院院長數季陶來擔任今天的主席。當他藍袍黑掛端莊的坐在主席藥上時，代表們誰都有一種想法：「今天來登民主的試場了。」</p>
<p>選舉投票的程序顯然較前兩次更熟練了，所以當秘書長在宣讀邀請各發票開票等監察員的代表大名後，各項節目就迅速的展開了。自十時十分始，秘書長宣佈開始發票到第一個代表的第一張票投進票匭時止，其中僅一分鐘多。從這個時候開始一直到投完最後一張票一共是一小時，全部票繼也都封好了。二千多票風平浪靜的送出了票匭，其中只有幾位代表，曾經把圈選後的票子顯給別人看表示眞實，引起了其他代表的不滿，不免有點小騷動，這是今天會場裏唯一的小風波。</p>
<p>副總統選舉開票的手續較選舉總統時多一道唱票。許多人說有心臟病的不能坐在這裏，十二隻票號一隻隻的打開，每一張唱，候選人真是唱一聲驚一次；自上午十一時半開始啓票匭，十一時三刻起唱票，一聲聲一句句拉緊了每個人的心弦。總計初賽結果獲得複賽權的是李宗仁，孫科，程潛，以李獲票最多，孫次之，程潛再次，于右老則在程的後頭，失去了複賽權。在十二個票匭的統計裏，第一匭的結果就是李程領先，孫第三，以後第二，第三·第四票匭開出的結果都是李宗仁領先，但程和李的距離漸漸接近，孫雖仍居第三，但已經在比例上漸落後了，到第五票匭開出，程潛以多李五票佔了冠軍，孫仍屈居第三各，第六票匭開出，李以多程一票又奪回了冠軍；自這次以後，李始終不退，第九匭開出，李遙遙領先，孫也跳出了第三的地位升為亞軍，這時程的啦啦隊不禁有點打油的掌聲，不過孫也僅僅是多了九票，到第十一票匭開出的時候，李的票數已破七百大關，程還沒走出五百；終於在十二票匭開完時，李獲冠軍，孫亞軍，程殿後。這個緊張的局面，從十一時三刻起一直到下午二時十分止，這兩個多鐘點不算短的時間，在此起彼落的啦啦隊掌聲中，演出够精彩的場面。</p>
<p>意外的事件</p>
<p>今天在會塲各色宣傳品裏比蛟刺目的有兩種：一是南京人報的「看誰奪得錦標」畫像，一是救國日報上的社論「廣東代表不投孫科的票」，前者較興趣化，後者却激怒了廣東代表；於是正是會裏緊張唱票時，救國日報的被搗毁，演出了更緊張的一幕。廣東代表在他們完成任務投完一票後，就一夥兒到救國日報質問洩忿，終於救國日報是被搗毀了。這一塲是非，是否給今天展開的民主政治揭幕來一個不小的諷刺呢？</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕山西農民代表賀敏，着對襟靑布短襖，靑布長褲，為全場服裝最樸素的一人。此公于投票出塲時語人：「我一共圈了四位」，言下似頗得意，不知實乃「投了一張廣票」。</p>
<p>蒞會參觀之各國使節，對選舉進行時之有序，及各代表所表現之「冷靜及愉快之氣氛」，均　致好評。</p>

<h3>社論　擴大配給的現成物資</h3>
<p>政府所收購的製成品，已由中信局第一次辦理標售，其項目爲煤球，肥皂，火柴，水泥等十種，大部份，均爲民生日用必需品，其標售採公開競買方式，以最高價爲得標，但以某種原因，據說當時並未標售成功，我們對於此種標售方式，亦確乎盼望他再改善一下。</p>
<p>在工貸停止以後，於本年一二月間，政府命令四聯，辦理成品之收購時，原含有兩種作用，一爲代替工貸，使廠商藉以應付陰曆年關之緊急措施，一爲掌握物資，尤其是一般民生日用必需品，藉以壓抑物價。這種高價標售的方式，是否與壓抑物似原意相符，是値得加以硏討的。</p>
<p>爲抑平物價起見，對於米，紗，布，黄金等主要物品，過去均曾辦過拋售。其效果如何，雖復言人人殊，但其拋售似格，多少總比市價要低廉些，即食糖，煤斤，食油，麵粉等，雖只辦配售，不辦拋售，其配價亦遠在黑市價格之下。所以就事論事，對於繼長增高中之物價漲風，多少可以收到相當的緩和之效。縱使隨時調整，未能主動地將物價完全　住，最多亦不過追隨黑市而已，究與領導漲價大有差別。</p>
<p>現在採用最高價得標的方式來公開競賣，其作用就大不相同了。因爲這是完全依照市價，而且完全依照最高的市價來標售的。照投標須知所定，只規定最低的底價，並沒有規定最高的限度，而且不及本次最高標價的投標人，如須請購同品名物實之餘量，亦槪照最高價計算。所以在這種公開競賣的方式之下，實際上是只許漲償，不許抑價成平價的。這種辦法，與當初所標掌握物資，抑平物價的原則，如何方可會通，實難了解。</p>
<p>記得當時收購成品之初，原有許多人意存懷疑，以爲這種貸款的代替方式，無異乘人之危，向廠商爭奪物資，收購以後，不啻改商囤爲官囤，所謂抑平物價，無非紙上風光，實際未必會有此事。假如拿最高價的標售方式來說，豈非不幸言中？」</p>
<p>各行局接受成品收購的申請，是本年二月七日才截止的。爾時本市的批發物價指數，還不過在二十萬到二十四萬倍之間，今已上升到五十萬倍餘了。短短地兩個半月之間，漲起了一倍半左右，拿國家行局的款項來做本錢，又不須耗費多大利息和風險，這筆生意，的確十分上算，不過利潤旣厚，所得已多，假如略把利子打得輕些，仍舊採用平價的方式來拋賣，在國庫不過少賺幾文，而一般物價，到底可以略形平定，至少亦不至因此而受刺激，則不但人民生活，無形中皆沾其光，即國家信譽，和通貨價値，亦皆將獲得良好的影饗。</p>
<p>關於工人生活指數問題，因爲上升太劇，廠商負担不了，紛紛請求變通。其惟一合理的解決辦法，大家認爲只有從擴大配給入手，庶幾指數較穩，而工人方面，可以不遭受到意外的　　　　　問題的，就是如許物資，究從何處可以獲得，有關當局集了許多次，並沒有確切的辦法，看來此路依然不通。我們意見，則以爲收購所得的成品，爲數旣然不少，而原定十七種的成品之中，十四種均屬民生日用必需品，此等必需品，在目前又確實掌握在政府手中，那麼，只須按照原來計劃，把原價標售的方針變通一下，而仿照食米，食油，食糖等成例，儘先供應配給，這問題便可迎刃而解了。頗問最近本市這一次勞資評斷會中，對於擴大配給的物資問題，曾議決請求政府予以協助，我們以爲實行協助的最便利方法，無過於利用這批已經購到，而囤積在倉庫中的成品。</p>
<p>這在政府，當然要担負相當的損失，但上文已經說過，充其量，亦不過少賺幾文而已，並不須眞正虧耗，亦不會損耗到他的合法利潤。而且擴大配給，是最高當局旣定的決策，各地正在極力推行之中，連盟邦的贈與物資，和一部份商家的產品，也在分別配合，以共同協助其實現，我們無理由可以相信，這批原用以抑平物價的收購成品，定要一律除外，賣給肯出最高價的投標人。中美救濟物資委員會美方代表團派粹克曾於其工作報吿內，根據其專家的意見，認爲「政府爲求發揮全力，應力求自產及輸入主要生活的必需物資利用上之確實改善，佐以相當之物價管制。」（見昨日本報）派氏所稱利用上之確實改善，無疑地即指供應配給而言，又此等自產的生活必需物資，在變賣時，如果採用最高價的競賣方式，那就沒有佐以相當之物價管制。所以這種最高價標售的方式，無論從擴大配給，或從管制物價上立論，都應加以從長計議的。</p>

<h3>川陜鄂邊境　大巴山防務</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員歐陽醇</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十八日航訊〕自從孔從周匪部在四月一日竄陷鄂陝邊境白河縣城，一路圍攻洵陽，另路南竄鄂西雙河口，得勝舖，譚家河，控制了竹谿，竹山兩縣後，川陜鄂邊境的大巴山防務，頓即成爲全國人士關心的問題了。大巴山北起廣元，東至巫溪，巫山，長達一千餘里，廿二年共匪徐向前部就曾竄擾通江，南江，巴中，經通江，萬源縣境竹峪鄉，沿關壩鄕，滾龍坡竄陷萬源，城口，宣漢，達縣，先後達二年之久。　國軍在大巴山設防還是去年十月間開始，共匪一度曾竄陷陜南安康，靑年軍陳部由重慶開抵淡中，始派部收復。屆時益陽部隊亦已絡續到達萬源，設若乘機會同陳部追擊，直搗孔部匪窠鄖西縣境，今日川陝鄂邊境的情勢，便不會如此嚴重了。</p>
<p>共匪竄川的主要道路有三條：（一）滾龍坡，距萬源縣僅六十華里，是離陜南鎭巴最近的一條岩道。滾龍坡高出地面一千公尺，地勢險峻，縣崖削壁，卅五年羅廣文部由此出川剿匪，即經此路。當時，因小道未及舖妥，跌斃了不少人馬。現在，一下雨，還是無法行走。鎭巴的棉花商，必須經過滾龍坡才能入川，益陽部感覺苦惱的，便是無法檢查來往挑担商人，負責情報的已經在棉花中發現了手槍，而出川的挑運黄表紙的商民，又可將防務全盤吐露。陝南，川東北交通不便，謠言足以影響人心和大局，所以，明知有匪徒混雄，都無法封鎖邊界。（二）由梨樹溪分路向東北經皮貨舖至大竹河，是由紫陽入川的要道，老百姓稱呼此路爲「人扒岩。」（三）巫溪境鷄心嶺進川。</p>
<p>記者曾實地觀察大巴山防務，確可說是固若金湯。但川陜鄂邊境，除了上列三條要道外，尙有十五條小徑。共匪詭計多端，向來避實就虛，値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>重慶行轅針對共匪的竄川企岡，先後曾在廣元，達縣成立兩個指揮所，分別由黄隱，方靖二位將軍負責主持，據有關權成人士觀察，川陜鄂邊境共匪最大的目的，仍在：（一）沿洵陽，安康，紫陽，鎭巴綫，岡攻廣元，俾可控制成都。但最近第四兵團司令官兼第十訓練處長羅廣文中將坐鎭漢中，一定可以粉碎共匪的計劃。（二）圖陷竹谿，竹山後，繼續南竄，封鎖長江上游。</p>
<p>目前，擾亂川萬源，城口，陝紫陽，嵐皋邊境的，不僅有共匪的成脅，還有嚴重的烟匪存在。聞名的六八道河，大界嶺因毗連四縣，竟成了「四不管」的地方。著名的烟匪有曾策安（陜籍）陳玉堂，陳開國。熊繼武（川籍）擁有人槍數百，爲害地方治安至鉅。據萬源縣長由維談稱：四縣縣長爲了澈底肅淸烟毒及會勘界址，決定四月廿五日在大竹河舉行會議。</p>
<p>共匪在川境的潛力絕對不可輕視。匪首朱德，王維周，劉伯承，陳賡，都生長四川。卅四年周恩來，葉劍英等自重慶撤退後，即將匪黨幹部散播四鄕各縣。王陵基主席由潯抵渝的第二日（六日）即實視這個問題。據報：廿四年，川東北各縣被徐向前匪部拐走的幼童，現已成人潛回。</p>
<p>第四兵團司令官羅廣文中將，戰時曾在重慶担任第十四軍軍長，負責淸剿川境的土匪。他說：不實行三殺政策，絕難肅淸土匪。他的三殺政策是：</p>
<p>（一）先殺無紀律的官兵，</p>
<p>（二）次殺通匪的鄉鎭長，</p>
<p>（三）最後才殺盡匪徒。</p>

<h3>阿拉伯六國擬派正規軍增援　巴基斯坦情勢嚴重　阿猶爭海發英擬再作斡旋</h3>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷廿三日電〕英國將於廿三日再作一次斡旋嘗試，使海發區之猶太與阿拉伯人同意休戰，前此之休戰談判經二十四小時猶阿雙方之激戰後，已於昨夜破裂。巴勒斯坦政府今日聲明；英軍當儘可能迅速自巴勒斯坦撤防，不願與任何一方發生爭執，但如有干涉實之撤退者，英軍決不予以容忍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海發廿二日電〕猶太地下軍今日控制海發，並提出議和條件，要求阿拉會人全部繳械後，阿拉伯人方面認爲礦難接受，準備撒離此間。同時，外約但全部與伊拉克及敘利亞大部份物資係田海發進口，該港旣被猶太軍佔領，阿拉伯各國有將全體出而千涉之處，據阿拉伯發言人稱，外約但國王阿勃杜拉必不聽任海發渝入猶太人手中。另據開羅消息，阿拉伯六國政府已同意五月十六日派兵赴巴勒斯坦大規模作戰，除非聯合國機構能在事前產生可以接受之解決方案。阿拉伯同盟方面承認過於低估猶太軍實力。大馬色廣報達兩地電訊亦謂，外約但或將派遺阿拉伯軍參戰，此項部隊會受英國訓練，阿拉伯義勇軍聞已開進巴基斯坦增援。海發阿拉伯居民一萬至一萬五千名則均麕集港口等待遺送至亞克爾。英軍當局宣稱，尚有一萬八千至二萬五千人亦將撤退·阿拉伯人難境時必須繳出全部兵器，俟五月十五日英國結束委任統治時，再由英方移交猶太地下軍作為戰利品。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷廿二日電〕海發港阿拉伯人主要防禦工事雖已被擊破，然阿拉伯人仍堅決抵抗不已，哈迦那軍猶增援不已，以擊潰阿拉伯最後的抵抗而佔領全港。阿拉伯婦孺已自港口登小舟撤往北部之阿克爾，海發區猶阿兩族閒之休戰談判，將於廿三日上午十一時縱續舉行。海發港人口十四萬五千名，阿拉伯人佔百分之四十強。根據巴勒斯坦分治計劃，海發應為阿拉伯港口。</p>
<p>〔路透社大馬色廿二日電〕叙利亞業已訓令其出席開羅阿拉伯聯盟政治委員會之代表，要求立即派阿拉伯國正規軍，於英國結束巴勒斯坦委治以前開入巴勒斯坦。伊拉克攝政伊拉廿二日離報達赴阿曼，與外約但王阿勃杜拉討論援助巴勒斯坦之計劃，伊拉在阿曼有十日勾留，伊拉克財政國防諸部長及參謀長薩伊時將軍均將參與會談。先是，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯解放軍司令沙夫華特將軍，表示巴勒斯坦境內之阿拉伯軍雖尙能繼續作戰，但急需阿拉伯聯盟諸國之切實援助，渠主張派阿拉伯國正規軍開入聖地，以建立和平與秩序。</p>

<p>〔路透社成功湖廿二日電〕聯大政治委員會今日恢復辯論巴勒斯坦問題，法代表巴洛第要求採取即時措施，使耶路撒冷成爲難民之避難所。巴氏提出決議案，請託管理事會，與委治國及關係國協商後，採取一切必要的揹施，以保護耶路撒冷城及其居民。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫代表維爾芬反對美國所提之巴勒斯坦托管計劃，澳洲要求聯合國巴勒斯坦委員會，立則進行設立臨時政府委員會並組織民團，並請巴勒斯坦委會於五月十五日起即會同此等臨時政府委員會接掌巴勒斯坦之行政責任。烏克蘭代表泰拉森哥要求實行分治，堅決反對托管計劃。巴西代表慕尼資支持託管計劃，並指出如使此一解決辦法得以收效起見，須由與巴勒斯坦問題直接有關之强國，成立執行托管計劃之協議，否則，該計劃恐極少成功之希望。猶太公會執委薛爾佛，指責委治當局國之拒絕合作以執行分治計劃，甚至不負當地治安之責任。渠認目前實施託管制度已覺過遲。蓋阿位伯國已準備於委治結束後，採取更大規模的軍事行動，如果拖延解決辦法，祗能使局勢愈趨嚴重而已。</p>

<h3>介紹邱吉爾新著</h3>
<p>—二次世界大戰回憶錄</p>
<p>〔本報紐約十六日航訊〕英國戰時首相邱吉爾的「二次世界大戰回憶錄」。已於四月十六日起在紐約時報和生活雜誌上同時刋載了。在英國，亦自同日起由每日電訊獨家刋載。</p>
<p>邱吉爾埋頭撰寫回憶錄的消息傳出以後，世人多寄以極大注意。因爲邱吉爾在二次大戰中身寄大英帝國安危的重任，對於這次戰爭的形成，發展，以及種種內幕，當然知之最深。</p>
<p>他並且有許多保留下來的機密文件與日記，足資利用。許多史家認爲，對於這次大戰，最有資格記述的，只有二人，一是羅斯福總統，一是邱吉爾首相。羅斯福旣於戰事未了時不幸驟然逝世，則邱吉爾的回憶錄，自然將成爲最受人注意的二次大戰的史料了。</p>
<p>這本回憶錄很長，共分五卷，準備每半年發表一卷。第一卷題名「風雨前夕」，係記叙自一九一九至一九三九年間的事情。它又分爲上下兩部，上部是「從戰爭到戰爭」，下部是「矇矓之戰」。每部中又分節，紐約時報四月十六日即第一天所刋載的，乃是第一卷上部的第一節，題目叫做「戰勝國的愚蠢」。</p>
<p>在第一節前，邱吉爾自己有一篇短短的序言，說這本回憶錄可以看作是他以前所寫關於首次大戰底書的延續。兩者如果連起來看，可說又是一塲「三十年戰爭」的記述。他謙遜地說，他所寫的並不是歷史，因爲歷史該留給下一代的人來寫；但他深信，這些回憶錄對於近代史當可有相當貢獻，以供將來之用。</p>
<p>在序言的最後一段中，邱吉爾提到，有一天，羅斯福說起，他正在徵詢，這次大戰應定個什麼名稱。他（邱吉爾）立刻回答說：應稱爲「不必要的戰爭」。因爲這塲把人類精華打得粉碎的戰爭，原是很可以避免得了的。在這長期的戰爭中，我們犧牲了數千百萬寳貴的生命，正義總算是勝利了，「但和平與安全仍未獲得，且陷於比過去所克服的更壞的危難之中。」所以，他希望這些回憶錄中所記述的前車之鑒，能成爲將來的後事之師，使下一代人不致重蹈過去的覆轍。</p>
<p>這正文第一節「戰勝國的愚蠢」，內容是從首次世界大戰結束時的情形寫起，包括戰後法國的狀况，萊茵問題，凡爾賽和約的條款，對於賠償問題的未曾重視，克里孟梭的下台，美國的不加入國際聯盟與孤立主義的成長，英美的海軍縮軍以及戰勝國的未能防止德國重整軍備等等。邱吉爾對於首次大戰後戰勝國家的過於寬容，行動遲綏，致便德國的軍國主義在夾縫中又吿死灰復燃，表示十分感慨。</p>
<p>這第一節已經頗長，佔一全版。四月十七日所刋的第二節，則是說到羅卡諾公約，一九二九年的經濟危機，以及他與保守黨領袖鮑爾溫的關係等等。紐約時報每日發表一節，星期日除外。第一卷可能如此連載五週，方能完畢。</p>

<p>〔本報台北二十三日電〕楊景局失蹤案，台省治安當局迄未接獲報吿，惟省警務處陸副處長己超，刑事蒙主任陳砥瀾，刻正嚴密簽査中。首先着手調査者，爲楊景局於十日上船時，是否被人刦奪船票。據基鹽港務局方面證明，確已安全上船，至是否被人刦奪船票，尙須査訪。港務局表示，曾聞楊在滬負債甚鉅。茲警務處決定俟二十五日民衆輪抵台後，將至該輪實地査勘。復據興台公司稱：楊五日抵台，寓羅斯福路該公司糖菓工廠，六日即遺失公司證明申請出境證，七日深夜遽稱染病，央工廠職員偕往古事醫院診治，但據醫師診斷結果，毫無病症，乃配予安寗性藥水未服，以此觀之，似見失常。九日晨離廠，徹夜未歸，十日晨復返廠，進早餐後外出，度即往基隆，十三日接滬電，始悉失蹤，乃於十六日刋登廣吿招尋，楊之岳父，廿八日來合探詢，未獲綫索，曾向公司表示請協助身後事宜。此案綫索，似全繫於是否被人刦奪船票，台警務處並望能獲悉楊生平情形。</p>

<h3>捲煙業大不景氣　工廠停頓三之二</h3>

<h3>紡織業赴港設廠　一部份現已開工　預計紗錠總額約有三十萬錠</h3>
<p>頃據金融業權威方面告稱，滬紗業鉅子在港設立紗廠者，截至目前止，已有十餘家之多。預計紗錠總額，可達三十萬錠。現已裝就開工者，有一千餘錠。正在繼續裝置者，亦有數千錠。預期在下月底前，即有一萬枚以上之紗錠開工。以目前生產成本及港地市價核算，每件棉紗可賺港幣五百元左右，而進出口全無限制，所得外匯，均可自由運用。惟據有關方面觀察，一俟國內經濟情形好轉，物價穩定以後，則遷港紗廠恐難與國內紗廠對抗。原因係港政府對工廠之管理及工人之福利事宜，均有嚴格之規定。例如女工不能担任夜工，童工不能替代成年工人，並對工人之工資及其衣食住行等，均有明確之規定。再如所需原料，除印棉以外，祗有訂購美棉。同時工廠之設備，因當地氣候關係，機器易受潮濕，裝置費用亦較浩大。故其一切工本，皆較國內爲高。但在目前，確爲謀利之會，但影響國家社會經濟實匪淺尠云。</p>
<h3>市價升降不多　食米趨勢盤旋　油市去化活潑由疲轉昂</h3>
<p>昨日米市，南北二市塲漲跌不一，惟上落均不多，趨勢不脫盤旋。南市塲晨開時，即因無錫價降，貨主在求脫不易之局面下，再行抑低價格，晨市曾降十萬元。後得悉北市塲價反趨上升，乃止跌轉堅。結果白粳高貨低二三萬，中次貨降五萬元，薄稻等均升五萬元。北市塲本街乘低吸取，轉挺五萬元。二市塲到貨共三千五百五十二石。</p>
<p>麺粉續趨下降，散戶頻吐不絕，蓋傳民調會將恢復本街之配粉，致呈有供而少求。兵船粉以一百卅四萬開，最低爲一百卅三萬，後以一百卅五萬五千元收市，計降二萬五千元。老車與兵船同價。紅蜂已退入一百卅萬元，麩皮再見軋小五千，小麥廠盤退入二百萬關內，爲一百儿十八萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧升沉不一，黄豆有客帮光顧，去化稍活，上挺五萬元。苞米供求相埒，市呈平定。菉豆客銷已停，猛挫二十萬元，赤豆亦跌，揀靑本銷尙平，價吿站定。芝蔴與上日彷彿，生仁廣帮復納，秦皇島生仁跳高六十萬元。</p>
<p>食油轉昂，買戶乘低納取，走化頓活。豆油回籠交易，由八百四十五萬而至八百五十八萬元，約升十八萬。生油漲廿五萬，吉桶生油漲爲九百八十萬元，生蔴油加二十萬，生菜油絕少交易。小車蔴油略秀五萬。豆餅汕廣帮雖未納進，然在人心轉堅下，亦升二萬元。</p>
<h3>暹統制米糧計劃　經僑商交涉撤銷</h3>

<h3>茶市實銷尚殷</h3>
<p>內銷茶，天津帮去化雖滯，但本街與蘇，錫，常等地，實需則猶絡繹，致過程續見活潑。價格方面，各色陳茶，在貨稀供缺中，依然愈盤愈堅。餘如本年度新貨，邇因到源踵接，一致原途徘徊，然底盤並不鞏固。至於洋莊茶市，過程漸轉岑靜，美銷不動，而目前法屬北菲，亦以需額將足，致買戶不取。惟執主心思尙屬不餒，市氣能巍站。</p>
<h3>火油供多價跌</h3>
<p>火油市面，近以美孚亞細亞等公司有大宗桶貨配出，每桶配價祗一千零，致市上籌碼益多，做開均以同業拆貨交易居多。高度桶油以一千六百萬至一千五百五十萬元均有互做，聽油僅做一百八十萬元，貨主鬆脫，市勢益疲。</p>
<h3>秦島存煤待運</h3>

<h3>短期庫劵銷路　關鍵全在利率　　〔本報訊〕短期庫券發行在即，國行當局對此期望甚殷。惟據金融界人士之觀察，認爲短期庫券之利率，尙低於市塲利率，值此物似波動之際，未必能收吸收游資之效。猶憶美金庫券以美元爲單位，相當不受物價之影響，銷路尙不如理想之暢。故對短期庫券之作用，不應寄以過大之希望。將來發行之庫券，除一部以有價證券之性質上市外，大部恐仍將山銀錢業承購。截至目前爲止，承購數額尙未有所決定。國貨外銷停滯　　滬錫部份布廠停開夜工　　頃據本市國貨業鉅子王性堯語記者稱，最近外銷紗布，因受港匯報縮及國外市價低落影響，暫時無法外銷，客戶在滬訂貨遂均未提出。而國內以實銷呆滯，無錫一帶布廠多已停開夜工。即本市範圍較小之棉織廠，多數亦停開夜工。目前國貨業，不僅紗布不易出口，即一般雜貨亦如此，可謂皆在停頓狀態中。市上籌碼寬裕　紗布市勢益疲　　昨日棉紗市况，因隔日紡建配售，塲上籌碼充沛，而客銷依然懈怠，本街走勢亦呆，同業吸胃淡薄，市勢益形不振。四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即跌進二億三千萬關，步低至二億二千七百萬元收盤，比之上日再跌三百萬元。賽光及水月亦續小二三百萬元。廿一支雙馬紗晨開喊一億四千八百萬有賣出，嗣雖有散戶及檯面帮之拉抬，曾叩一億五千萬關，奈以供過於求，欲振乏力，近收以一億四千七百萬元收盤，較上日續小五百萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，普跌五六十萬至四五百萬元不一　　昨日棉布市况，以紡建又値配布之期，民營染廠供售亦多，客帮銷路狹窄，浮多轉吐，市盤迂迴下鴻。十二碼龍頭細布，初開喊四百九十萬元，供多求少，一路下降至四百八十六萬元結束，比之上日再降五萬元。彩球五福等細布，亦步跌四至七萬元，其餘嗶嘰漂布元布及土林布等市，一致趨軟。　　又訊：紡建公司供售之五福細布准購單倒貼三萬元，最後龍頭細布四百八十五萬元有人肯賣云　　紡建售紗　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司，昨（廿三）循例開售棉紗，計十四種，申購單共二四〇張，售出棉紗六二二件，合廿支紗一〇一八件。　　各紗核售價如次：二十支金寳星一二五〇〇萬元，十支副藍鳳七四〇○萬元，十支立馬七四〇〇萬元，十六支紅月九九〇〇萬元，二十支仙桃二等一二四〇〇萬元，卅二支仙桃一六四〇〇萬元，卅二雙股仙桃一七三〇〇萬元，卅二支雙股豐年一七九〇〇萬元，四十支日光一七八〇〇萬元，四十支TK彩球二一二〇〇萬元，六十支日光二二八〇〇萬元，六十支雙股日光燒毛二九八〇〇萬元，一百支雙股日光燒毛一三〇〇〇〇萬元。　　現棉軟弱　　昨日現棉市况，因棉紗走銷呆化，價格步挫，人心虛軟，貨主爭欲脫手，喊價步降，買方納胃不旺，開價尤低，趨勢盤旋，交易平庸，成交四百包。海提尖做開送公庫價一八七〇萬元，涇陽二五〇〇萬元，老河口二二一〇萬，火機一八四〇萬，周浦籽花四七〇萬。　　宣維銷暢　　宣維呢邊日銷路頗形暢達，本街客帮咸有需要。顏色方面，以淡色最爲活躍，售價則比其他呢羢嗶嘰爲平疲，蓋受粤漢路私貨充斥影響，演口輪船到滬，每次均有相當貨色帶來，而四分之三均爲宣維呢，以致市價日疲，形成供過於求。昨由漢帶申之宣維呢，每碼俱喊沽四百萬元，中紡牌子則售三百七十五萬元，怡和協新售四百三四十萬元，美國貨四百六七十萬元，英國貨五百七八十萬元。香港金滙行情　　〔本報香港二十三日電〕黄金三三七，美元五·七，國幣八一，申電七九。　　〔合衆社香港廿三日電〕廿三日香港黄金金融市塲之開收盤價格如下：（單位港幣元）　　開價　收價　　黃金每兩　三三五·五〇　三三六·〇〇　　美元　五·六七　五·六六　　國幣百萬元　八·二〇　八·一五　　英鎊　一三·〇〇　一三·〇〇商業簡訊　　　　中國銀行今日午後三時在該行舉行本年股東常會。除報吿卅六年度營業情形，並決定去年度紅利之分配。　　據關係方面稱：本年度江浙春繭收購貸款，當局曾經決定七成貸放。頃悉現已增爲八成，廠商自備墊頭二成。至於詳細實施辦法，尙在硏討中。　　四川蠶絲貸款，已經四聯總處通過，總額爲四千六百億。繅絲一千五百担，係按八折貸借，到期政府亦按八折收購成品。　　中央信託局裝食鹽六千五百噸，明日運往日本，作對日易貨之用。此批食鹽，係合灣省出產者。　　中信局於廿一日首次標售上年國家行局收購成品，因上週市價超過本週，故均未曾標出，現正設法改變標售辦法。　　貼放委員會貿易顧問委員會昨（廿三）舉行首次會議。除報吿事項外，幷討論議決有關出口物資外銷貸款轉抵押等案四件云華股上落狹隘　臨收稍見回升　　華股昨證券帮進取之念倍切，但大戶龍某等，尙有晴售，前市先穩後疲，華新獨吿漲停，後市負担减輕，銀行有買，臨收小康。　　晨初仍以幣制關係，人心略秀，永紗開一九五〇元高價，外匯牌價未更，跌至一八九〇元低價，七一號等趁低吸收，外股略秀，升爲一九三〇元。代辦費兩天負担，仍須十八元及二一元，人心仍疲，交易極少，又以脫手者多，退至一九〇五元。一四五號等尙納，升爲一九二三元。三五號等了結不已，近午終吿渙散，退至一八九八元結束。較前收計華新獨昂半成，中法永業小秀，大通國貨新華平平，餘均小挫。　　後市永紗上塲一九三五元，不過兩天負担而已，初被進至一九四〇元，後曾被賣到一九〇九元，國行差進不多，銀行略亦納，牌價之謠又起，臨收迫高至一九八〇元，收市一九七五元。較晨收計各股一致微升，塲外各未上市股票榮辱仍微。　　公債昨平穩逾恒，成交約四百萬。統丙晨開一〇萬四，自一〇萬三升至一〇萬八收市，較前收各債一致微升一千元。　　外股亦見式微，交易有限，證券帮吸收怡紗，洋商進而銀行帮出亞洲，港電平而穩。怡紗晨開二八〇萬，自二八二萬微降至二七八萬，最後在二八〇萬光景掙扎。較前收計怡紗會德豐平平，鋼業亦然，英聯業廣怡啤小升，紙版航業微挫，英聯下月中旬將開股東會，流通籌碼，因是見减，較爲俏利。</h3>

<p>文史胡適題「貓名」寓言的演變  季羨林　　在中國的民間故事裏有一個故事的類型非常別緻有趣。這類故事的主要特點是：先從一件東西說起，一件一件的說下去，前後的次序一點也不牽强，看起來很自然；但結果繞一個大彎子又回到原來的東西上，或者扯到一件同原來的東西絕不相容的，放在一起讓人只覺得滑稽的東西。我不知道專家們怎樣稱呼這個類型，我想替牠起一個名字，呌做「循環式」。這類故事的起源當然也很早；但以前的我們不淸楚了，我現在只預備從明朝說起。明劉元卿的應諧錄裘記載了一個短的寓言：　　齊奄家畜一猫，自奇之，號於人曰「虎猫」。客說之曰：「虎誠猛，不如龍之神也。請更名曰龍猫。」又客說之曰：「龍固神於虎也。龍升天須浮雲，雲其尙於罷乎？不知名曰雲。」又客說之曰：「雲靄蔽天，風倐散之，雲固不敵風也。請更名曰風。」又客說之曰：「大風飆起，維屛以牆，斯足蔽矣。風其如牆何？名之曰牆猫可。」又客說之曰：「維牆雖固，維鼠穴之，牆斯圯矣。牆又如鼠何？即名曰鼠猫可也。」東里丈人嗤之曰：」噫唔！捕鼠者固猫也。猫即猫耳，胡爲自失其本眞哉！」（　說郛　第四十五）　　這個寓言雖然由劉元卿記載了下來，但據我看牠的來源一定是流行在民間的故事。也許在民間已經流行了很多年，纔遇到一位文人把牠寫了下來。這個寓言的主角是猫，結果却經過了虎，龍，雲，牆，把猫同老鼠扯在一處。由虎說到龍，由龍說到雲，由雲說到牆，這次序非常自然，一點也不牽强；但終於說成「鼠猫」，成了一個很幽默的諷刺。世界上無論那一國的寓言，裏面都多半包含着一個道德敎訓，這個寓言也有一個道德敎訓，就是：一個人不應該失掉了「本眞」。　　在日本也有一個相似的寓言。我不知道原出那一本書，我看到的只是王眞夫先生的譯文，題目呌做「日本古笑話」，見民國三十二年七月藝文雜誌創刋號。我現在就把譯文抄在下面：　　有一個人非常好勝，養了一隻猫，也想給牠起一個最偉大的名字。想了好久，起了一個「天」字。朋友聽得，說道：「天也爭不過雨雲呀！」「那麼就喚作雨雲罷。」「雨雲也爭不過風呀！」「那麼喚作風罷。」「風還是爭不過風窗紙呀！」「那麼喚作窗紙罷。」「窗紙爭不過老鼠呀！」「如此說來，還是喚作猫罷。」　　我們一看就可以知道，這個寓言同中國的那一個非常相似。只有幾處有點區別，譬如一開頭不說虎，龍，而只說天，由天說到雲；不說墻，而說窗紙；最後一句：「如此說來，還是喚作貓罷。」遠不如中國「鼠貓」兩個字有含蓄而又幽默。但這些區別都很小，這裏的主角仍然是貓，也是要替貓起一個名字。所以這個寓言很可能是從中國流傳過去的。　　中國雖然能把這個寓言輸出去，但輸出的可惜也不是國貨。同許多別的流傳在民間的故事一樣，這個寓言的老家大槪也是印度。在梵文故事集說海（Kathasaritsagara）裏我們找到一個類似的寓言。我手邊沒有梵文原本，我只能從Tawney和Penzer的英譯本裏把這個故事譯出來（第五册一〇九頁）：　　從前一個隱士拾到一隻從鷹爪裏掉出來的小老鼠，覺得很可憐，於是就運用神通力把牠變成一個少女，帶到自己　居的地方去。當他看到她已經長大了的時候，他想替她找一個有力的丈夫。他先把太陽喊來，對太陽說：「娶這個女孩子罷！我想把她嫁給一個有力的丈夫。」太陽回答說：「雲比我還有力，他一會的工夫就可以把我遮起來。」隱士聽了，把太陽放走，又把雲喊了來，讓他娶她。雲回答說：「風比我還有力，只要他高興，他可以把我吹到天空裏任何地方去。」隱士聽了，又把風喊了來，仍然向他作同樣的建議。風回答說：「山比我更有力，因爲我不能够移動他們。」這大隱士聽了，就把喜馬拉亞山喊來，想把女孩子嫁給他。山回答說：「老鼠比我更有力，因為他們能够在我身上挖洞。　　這隱士聽了這些　　的神們的回答，就喊來一隻林鼠，對牠說：「娶這個女孩子」牠回答說：「請你吿訴我，她怎樣　進我的穴裏去。」隱士說：「牠最好這是變成一隻老鼠。」於是他又把她變成老鼠，嫁給那隻雄鼠。　　這個寓言同流傳在中國和日本的那一個「貓名」寓言內容有點差別這裏面主角不是貓，而是老鼠，貓在這裏根本沒有露面，當然更談不到替牠起什麽名字。這寓言的中心故事是老鼠招親。從老鼠說起，經過太陽，雲，風，山，終於還是回到老鼠。　　在別的梵文寫成的故事書裏也有這樣一個寓言，譬如說在五卷書（Tancatantra）裏就可以找到。五卷書最早的形式是Tantrakhyayika，在這裏面已經有這樣一個寓言了。美國梵文學者F.Eogeron構擬出來的所謂原始五卷書裏當然也有，而且同Tantrakhyayika裏的那一個幾乎定全一樣。我現在從梵文裏把Tantrtakhyayika裏的那一個萬言譯出來：　　一個苦行者在恒河裏洗澡。正開始嗽嘴的時候，一個從鷹爪裏逃出來的小老鼠掉在他手裏。這苦行者把牠放在一棵無花菓樹的下面，又洗了洗澡，就想回到他的隱居的地方去。他忽然想到那個小老鼠，他自己想：「我把那個失掉了父母的小老　忘掉了，眞有點殘忍。」這樣想過，他就又走回去，運用神通力把小老鼠變成一個少女，帶回家去，交給他的設有子女的老婆，說道：「親愛的，把這個女孩子好好的養大！」時間漸漸過去，女孩子已經十二歲了。這仙人想把她出嫁，因爲：　　一個在父親的房子裏看到月信的女子　　應該被人看作是一個Vrasali；按傳統的說法Vrsali不是Sudra女子。　　所以我想把她嫁給一個平等的男人，因為：　　兩個人資產相當，門戶相當。　　可以結婚，可以作朋友，一個富一個窮就不行。想過以後，他把太陽喊了來，對他說道：「娶這個女孩子！」這一個永遠用自己的眼睛看一切事情的世界的保護者（太陽神）說：「雲比我更有力，仙人，因爲我雖然出來，但他可以把我遮起來，」苦行者覺得這話有理，就把雲喊了來，對他說道：「娶我的女孩子！」雲也有同樣的理由：「風比我更有力，他能够把我吹散，吹到任方向去。」苦行者就把風喊了來：「娶我的女孩子！」但是風都說：「仙人，山比我更有力，因爲我一點也不能動搖他。」苦行者於是就把一個山喊過來：「娶我的女孩子！」山說：「我們確是不能動搖，但是老鼠却有辦法。他們能够在我們身上鑽一百個洞。」苦行者沉思了一會，喊過一隻雄鼠來，對他說道：—娶我的女孩子！」雄鼠說：「那不行。我怎樣地她帶進我的洞穴裏去呢？」苦行者覺得這話有道理，於是就又運用神通力把她變成原來的樣子。　　在五卷書裏這個寓言最早的形式就是這樣。在晚出的由耆那敎的和尙Purnabbbdra改編的五卷書裏，這個寓言也被收進去；但內容同風格都有點差異了。開頭先來了一段想當長的描寫，把恒河裏的水的動盪，魚的跳躍和因這跳躍而起的泡沫，浪潮的變幻都描繪了一番。以下接着寫在這河邊上的苦行者的情形，他們的衣服，他們吃的東西。再以下纔是正文。這一段長的描寫只用了幾個離合釋（Samasa，英文叫做Compound），表現出一種純粹藝術詩（Kavya）的風味。我們上面譯出的Tantrakliyayika裏的那個寓言已經不能够代表原來流行在民間的形式，已經是文人學士的作品，這裏這一個更離民間形式遠了。在女孩子到了十二歲的時候，隱士想替她找一個丈夫。在上面譯的寓言裏緊接着有兩首詩，但在Purnabhadra的改訂本裏却有十一首。這常然都是後加的。這也是文人學士的成績，他們故意引用這樣許多詩來表示他們的淵博。在上而譯出的那個寓言裏的第一首詩的意思是，在女孩子有月信以前就應該結婚。但在Purnabhadra的改編本裏這點很簡單的意思却引用了九首詩來表達。下面這一首詩可作代表：　　所以應該把女孩子嫁出去，趁她還沒有月信的時候。一個八歲的女孩子的出嫁是可以讚美的。　　這樣的詩雖然與本文沒有多大關係，但我們從這裏可以看出古代印度人對女子結婚的看法，也是非常有趣的。　　同說海裏的那個寓言一樣，在五卷書的這一個寓言裏，主人也不是猫，而是一隻小老鼠。在這裏也是從太陽說起，也是經過了雲，風，山，最後說到老鼠，完成了這個「環」。這兩個寓言同中國和日本的「貓名」寓言，初看起來，似乎有很大的差別；但倘一仔細研究，就可以看出來，牠們都屬於同一個類型：「循環式」，而且印度很可能就是這個寓言的老家。印度寓言裏的主角是老鼠，由老鼠想到猫，於是中間不知經過了多少演變，在中國和日本猫就變成了主角。雖然老鼠已經降爲配角；但牠在這裏仍然佔一個位置。這一點據我看就能暗示出中國的「猫名」寓言和印度的「老鼠結婚」寓言的關係。此外在印度寓言裏的雲在中國寓言也出現了，這也可以給我們一點硏究這兩個寓言間相互的關係的綫索。我們硏究比較文學，往往可以看出一個現象：故事傳佈愈廣，時間愈長，演變也就愈大；但無論演變到什麽程度，裘面總留下點痕迹，讓人們可以追踪出牠們的來源來。正像孫悟空把尾巴變成旗桿放在廟後面一樣，楊二郞一眼就可以看出來，這座廟是猴兒變的。　　我上面只談到這個寓言在中國，日本和印度演變的情形。在別的國家也可以找到同樣的寓言。因爲別的學者已經談到，我在這裏就不談了。　　（三十七年三月二十四日北平）白石詞選辨僞  夏承燾　　白石詞選一卷，題「螺川陳元能少章編」，乃紫芝漫鈔宋元名家詞之一。會藏毛氏汲古閣，今藏北平圖書館，十年前鄉友劉君子植錄自平館寄貽者也。書凡三十八頁，頁十八行，行十五字。選詞六十二首編次與各本皆異。少章嘗注周美成詞。今所傳片玉集，題「廬陵陳元龍少章。」廬陵北有螺子山，又名螺川，故此題「螺川」。片玉集有劉肅必欽序，署「嘉定　未。」知少章實白石同時人。（白石紹定二年尙健在，見吳潛履齋詩餘，時在嘉定辛未後十八載。）此編若眞出少章手，在姜詞選本中，比花庵詞選爲尤珍貴矣。又其目錄六十六首中，只四首不注宮調，亦他本姜詞所無，足爲校訂音律之助。惟細審全編，有不可遽信者數事，約舉如次：　　編中於有旁譜各詞，皆題「自製曲」，列於無譜諸詞之後，而暗香疏影二苜，則獨拔冠全編，實自亂其例；又揚州慢小序後綴一語云：「此後几載宮調者，並是自製曲」。此顯襲花庵詞選之文。而與目錄次第，乃相戾剌。此其一。　　再就其所注宮調考之，有與世傳金奩，子野，片玉，于湖，明秀，夢窗諸集相符者，如：　　　絳屑，滿江紅皆注仙呂　；水龍吟注越調；齊天樂注正宮；訴衷情注商調；側犯注大石；慶宮春注越調；浣溪沙注黄鐘。亦有訛誤違律者；如　　揚州慢注中呂，奪，「宮」字；阮郞歸注南呂調，「南」當作「仙」：此尙可諉爲傳寫筆誤；若念嬌奴本大石調，白石過腔作湘月，原序明云雙調，而此本乃注小石；暗香疏影是仙呂另，而注仙呂調；仙呂宮是夷則宮，仙呂調則夾則羽矣；玲瓏四犯乃夾鐘商雙調，而此注大石調：皆屬顯謬。　　甚至有援據元曲者；如：　　鷓鴣天注大石調，同太和正音譜，此猶可云元曲宮調或沿自宋詞；若淸波引注雙調，乃同元曲之淸江引，「波」「江」不辨，寗非過率！（淸波引始見於白石集，與元曲淸江引體制同異。）　　其無徵難信者，幾占全篇三之一；如：　　一萼紅注夾鐘，八歸，探春慢注黄鐘，踏莎行，眉嫵注正平，夜行船注小石調，琵琶仙，　聲繞紅樓注雙　，念嬌奴注仙呂，月下笛注仙呂調，摸魚兒注正宮，好事近汪越調，虞美人注道宮，憶王孫注歇指調。在詞　中皆無可考證。　　其中最可詫笑者，則爲指玲瓏四犯爲大石；案：宋本姜詞目錄，此首下注云：「世別有大石調一曲。」蓋以周美成右同調「機李夭桃」一首，詞句與此大異，故於此加注分別。茲編乃徑注大石。露此罅隙，知其人實昧干樂紀。予初以其浣溪沙，點絳屑，側犯，齊夭樂，慶宮春，水龍吟各首宮調，皆同片玉，疑其書實出於少章；然少章不得下援元曲；且此編法曲獻仙音注大石，與片玉注小石者亦不同（四印齋刋元巾箱本淸眞集此調注大石。）知非出一手。少章注片玉，雖不涉宮律，然其人坐詞樂方盛之時，諒不致疏陋若是也　　茲編體例旣嫌凌亂，譌文奪字，較各本尤甚，疑其書實元明人僞託。美成白石齊名，以少章曾注片玉，故託名借重。在陶鈔姜詞未出之前，此以較花庵所錄多出二十餘首，乃世所未見，故爲汲古珍視；陶鈔旣出，此即眞出於少章，亦無足貴矣　　姜詞　本，世間僅此與姜虬綠鈔本兩種，姜鈔近負盛名，此編則知者較少，予旣爲姜鈔辨僞，慮世人或爲此秘籍所眩，爰略疏知此。舊為姜詞校律，嘗誤據茲編，亦欲藉此文爲湔洗也。　　（後記）子植貽予此本時，函「「實一無長處。吿頃寫茲文，偶獲一事：白石杏花天影，各本

兒童隊傳話密報，少年隊盤査會哨，壯年隊種地當兵放大砲，高年隊站崗放哨，老年隊看護指導，婦女隊縫洗助耕把家照。」法幣版式  吳庸　　筆者素來認爲我國的通貨在實質上並無多大問題，即有問題，亦不應如一般所設想之嚴重，而事實上竟是形成如此的嚴重局面者，簡單一句話，只是「人謀不臧」的結果。所謂「人謀不臧」，人民妄事猜疑是其一，當局措施不當是其二。是故今日通貨之惡化，人民與當局應各負其責。　　今姑舉法幣之版式一點言之。査抗戰前之數年，鈔票之發行機關並不統一，除中中交農四行外，純為民營之銀行，如四明，中國通商等，亦爲發行鈔票之機關，那時鈔券版式之不一，於情理上還勉强可以說得過去。在抗戰期中，發行統歸於中央，此爲我國鈔票發行史上之一士進步。可是同一機關所發行之鈔，其版式仍未能統一，非但予人民以惡劣印象，且在國際視聽上亦不無不良影饗。　　試看我國今日之貨幣，除台灣有台幣，東北有流通券，各有其比値外，即法幣本身，其名稱就有法幣與關金二種，其式樣又各多得不可勝計。雖爲同一票面，同時發行，而大小不同，顏色不一，圖案各異。比如拿最近發行之大鈔來說，五千元關金（法幣十萬）就有三種版式，二千五百元關金（法幣五萬）一種，二千元關金（法幣四萬）八種。今日國人所要求者爲統一，法幣爲同一機關所發行，謀其統一，當非難事，而今日竟尙未能統一者，眞礙於事實上之困難歟？抑爲「隨便主義」之表現歟？洛維特這個人  銅駝　　這一時，我國使節爲了美援問題，曾迭次訪問過美國代理國務卿洛維特。洛維特的全名是勞勃、A、洛維特（RobertA．Lovett），他的職位是助理國務卿，但在國務卿出行期間，有權代理國務卿職務。現在馬歇爾出國赴哥倫比亞開會期間，洛維特即執行國務卿事務，故報紙上所稱洛維特的頭銜，即以代理國務卿名之。　　洛維特出身空軍，在第一次大戰時，任職飛行員，親　鋒鏑，到敵軍陣地夜襲，獲得海軍十字獎徵。他不單是一個優良的飛行員，且因實際經驗，規劃進步的轟炸理論，即在二十五年之後的第二次大戰中，還是不刋之論。第一次戰後一變而爲成功的銀行家，鐵路與保險公司的常務董事，對於歐洲工業和外匯堪稱專家，能者無所不能，洛維特之贏得馬卿信任，倚爲左右手，以至被譽爲馬卿的智囊，實非偶然。　　美國在一九三八年，早已料到要形成第二次大戰，並推論到美國國防問題，洛維特即重行硏討航空種種技術。到一九四〇年，氏應美陸軍部之召，即擺脫一切商業關係，赴華盛頓任空軍作戰部副主任，在整個戰局中，外界雖絕鮮聽到他的大名，但却盡了實際有效的工作。　　洛維特胃病極重，在一九四〇年至四五年時，幾乎完全屛絕烟酒，祗能吃一點與嬰兒所吃相同的食品。但其時他每天要工作十二小時，即在星期休似，至少也有四小時的工作。嚴重的胃病，幾乎使他不能担任現在的職位。一九四六年冬季，即是洛維特辭去陸軍部職務後一年，他動過手術。三個月之後，身體仍極衰弱，突然接獲馬歇爾來信，吿訴他已接受任命爲國務卿之職。馬卿與洛維特在戰時曾密切合作過，對於洛氏的材幹與性格，因曾共渡艱難，所以瞭解極深。馬卿要他担任助理國務卿，洛維特覺得難以謙辭，惟據醫師意見，還要等待三個月，看他是否能恢復健康再說，馬卿情願等他三個月之後的回音。　　洛維特到海岸去休養，休養期間搜集必要材料，照常做分析和參考的工作。三個月之後，健康恢復，醫生認爲堪負重任，他就到華盛頓履新了。　　馬歇爾在戰時的大部份決議，只經過周詳的思老而不暇規劃細則。現在馬氏任國務卿後亦屬同樣情形。馬卿大部份時間只能致力於國際事務之「高級戰略」，而由洛維特去執行國務部的工作，所以國務部衷負實際　任的是洛維特。　　新聞界對於國務卿及代理國務卿不大肯發表談話，頗不滿意。馬歇爾常期服務軍政，因此過於想保守國策的秘密以策安全；洛維特則完全走的是馬歇爾路綫，惟「馬」首是瞻。現在的洛維特經過與新聞記者常期接觸的經騐，已比較肯透露一些消息。但他關於重要事件，仍要用一種灰色的語調答覆記者說：「對於這件事我倒可以給你一個直接答案——我不知道！」</p>

<h3>National Assembly Decides to Postpone Closing; Vice Presidential Election to Continue; Preliminary Results Show Li, Sun, Cheng Leading</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The inauguration ceremony for the President and Vice President will be held on May 5th at the Presidential Palace, with Wu Jingheng administering the oath.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold the second Vice Presidential election session at 9 a.m. on the 24th. Delegates will vote to select one candidate from the top three vote-getters from the 23rd: Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian. The presidium held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd and decided to appoint Zhang Xiwen as the chairman for the general assembly on the 24th. Whether the general assembly will be held in the afternoon of the 24th will depend on the results and timing of the Vice Presidential election vote count in the morning, and the presidium will hold an ad hoc meeting to decide. The assembly was originally scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 24th, but due to the unfinished Vice Presidential election, it must be postponed. During the presidium meeting on the evening of the 23rd, the issue of postponing the closing was discussed. Because it was impossible to predict whether a Vice President could be elected on the 24th, it was decided in principle to postpone the closing, but the specific duration of the postponement, whether one or two days, was not decided. The Vice Presidential election ballots for the 24th were printed late on the night of the 23rd. The presidium appointed Wang Xingzhou, Ma Shaowu, and Chen Lianfen to supervise the printing and affix their personal seals. The ballots were sealed overnight and will be unsealed in public on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The first session of the National Assembly's Vice Presidential election was held in the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 23rd. 2,648 representatives attended. Dai Chuanxian presided. As a result of the election, none of the six Vice Presidential candidates received the statutory number of votes required for election. Li Zongren received 754 votes, Sun Ke received 559 votes, Cheng Qian received 522 votes, Yu Youren received 493 votes, Mo Dehui received 218 votes, and Xu Chuanlin received 214 votes. In accordance with Articles 4, Paragraph 3, and 5 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the Chairman Dai Chuanxian announced upon completion of the vote count that a second election session would be held at 9 a.m. on the 24th to re-vote among the top three vote-getters. After days of intense and heated competition among the six Vice Presidential candidates, the results of the ballot counting at 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd showed that Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian had achieved initial victory and qualified for the second election.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Vice Presidential Election Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The Vice Presidential election session on the 23rd began at 9:30 a.m. After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that the Vice Presidential election was conducted in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law and the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election Voting and Ballot Counting Regulations. He explained this repeatedly for 20 minutes. In addition to the election supervisors who were drawn in advance to supervise the distribution of ballots, Yu Bin, Yu Xuezhong, and Su Ting, appointed by the presidium, were asked to monitor the unsealing of the ballots to show solemnity. At 10:05 a.m., after all preparations were completed, Secretary-General Hong announced the closure of all main and side doors of the hall, prohibiting entry and exit. At 10:10 a.m., voting began. Ballots were distributed and elections were held separately upstairs and downstairs. Due to thorough preparation in advance, the voting was orderly and proceeded smoothly. Only during the downstairs voting, a female staff member, Gong Qili, stood in front of the ballot box. When Representative Wang Weizhi and another representative were voting, she showed Wang what was circled on the ballot, causing an uproar among the Guangdong representatives, who shouted the female staff member out of the venue. This briefly caused a moment of commotion, but it calmed down after Wang left. The voting lasted one hour and was completed at 11:13 a.m. After a 20-minute break, the meeting resumed at 11:30 a.m. and the ballot counting process began immediately. At 11:50 a.m., the supervisors unsealed the ballot boxes and began counting the ballots. Wang Enqiao, deputy head of the assembly's documentation group, was appointed as the ballot reader, with the supervisors standing beside him. After each ballot was read, it was handed over to the tally clerks to count the votes. After each box was opened and read, a preliminary tally was made and displayed on the electronic tally board. During the ballot counting, whenever the names of several people were read in succession, applause would erupt in the hall. At the beginning of the ballot counting, Cheng Qian and Li Zongren took an early lead. By the time the eighth ballot box was opened, Sun Ke's vote count began to approach Cheng Qian's. By the time the ninth ballot box was opened, Li Zongren suddenly created a record of 567 votes with a count of 131 votes. After the tenth ballot box was opened, Sun Ke's vote count gradually increased. By 2:10 p.m., the ballot counting was completed. Secretary-General Hong reported that 2,790 ballots were issued today, and a total of 2,785 ballots were cast, of which 23 were invalid, for a total of 2,760 valid votes. Chairman Dai Chuanxian announced the election results after the ballot counting was completed and reported that, in accordance with the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, another election would be held on the morning of the 24th. The entire hall applauded thunderously. At 2:25 p.m., this tense and heated first Vice Presidential election battle came to a preliminary conclusion.</p>
<h3>Outside the National Assembly: A Scene of Violence</h3>
<p>"National Salvation Daily" Vandalized Yesterday; Six Staff Members Injured in Conflict</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Scenes of violence are emerging one after another at the National Assembly. On the day of the Vice Presidential election, Guangdong representatives and overseas Guangdong representatives vandalized the Nanjing "National Salvation Daily," and several people were injured. As the Vice Presidential election campaign intensified, newspapers campaigned for candidates. Some newspapers maintained a neutral stance, while the opinions of others were inevitably biased. The "National Salvation Daily" had published many articles attacking Sun Ke in recent days. On the 23rd, the newspaper published an editorial titled "Guangdong Representatives Will Not Vote for Sun Ke – A Statement from a Guangdong Representative," which aroused the resentment of the Guangdong representatives. At 11:30 a.m. on the 23rd, after the Vice Presidential election vote, the Guangdong representatives and overseas Guangdong representatives gathered hundreds of people, took two National Assembly buses, and drove to the "National Salvation Daily" on Taiping Road, intending to find the editor-in-chief Gong De'bai to question him. Because Gong was not there, a conflict broke out, and the business department and editor-in-chief's office of the "National Salvation Daily" were vandalized. The Guangdong representatives then took cars to the newspaper's factory in Zeng Gongci and vandalized the machine room and typesetting room. At 12:30 p.m., the Guangdong representatives received reporters in the second-floor lounge of the National Assembly and reported on the incident. According to Gao Xin, Shen Zhechen, and others, they went to question the newspaper and request to see the original manuscript. They sent Zhang Fakui, Shen Zhechen, and Tang Gengcheng representatives to negotiate, but the staff of the "National Salvation Daily" attacked them, which led to a conflict. In the chaos, the newspaper seemed to have been damaged. Gong De'bai, the editor-in-chief of the "National Salvation Daily," said that he was out when the incident occurred and only learned about it after returning. Hu Yunlong, an injured staff member of the newspaper, said that after the Guangdong representatives rushed in, they started beating and vandalizing without negotiating. After the business department was vandalized, they threatened two workers with "death" to lead the way and took cars to the factory in Zeng Gongci. By that time, the factory had already heard the news that the newspaper office had been vandalized. The workers used wooden pillars to block the middle door, but the representatives broke through the middle door, and the machine room, typesetting room, paper cutter, telephone, and other things were completely destroyed. According to police officers who witnessed the scene, the "National Salvation Daily" received threatening letters a few days ago and requested protection. The police station sent 20 police officers to be responsible. At 11:50 a.m. this morning, the Guangdong representatives arrived by car. After getting off the car, they surrounded the newspaper office. Some people went inside, and others blocked the police officers from entering, saying, "You maintain order outside, and we will be responsible for what happens inside." They then took cars to Zeng Gongci. The police officers rushed to the factory on foot. By the time they arrived, the factory had already been vandalized, and the representatives had not yet left. When they saw the police officers arrive, they said, "We'll leave this to you as well," and then left by car, after about an hour. A police officer even produced a list of injured persons that he had investigated, including Liu Xihan, Hu Yunlong, Wu Peiyuan, Shen Junrong, Zhang Xin'sheng, and worker Lv Yufan, six staff members of the "National Salvation Daily". The situation of the newspaper being vandalized was very tragic. The miscellaneous items in each room were messy. In particular, in the typesetting room, all the type racks were scattered, and it was feared that it would not be possible to sort them out in a day or two. However, Gong De'bai declared that he would still try to publish tomorrow.</p>
<h3>New Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, to Depart Soon for the East</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] The new Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, and his wife will soon depart for China. They completed passport and visa procedures at our embassy in the Soviet Union yesterday. The dispute should not cause more trouble in the legal aspect and increase more difficult disputes. Finally, it was unanimously decided to submit review opinions to the National Government. Regarding the National Assembly representatives, it was believed that "according to the constitutional provisions, the number of regional representatives cannot be increased. If the number of occupational group representatives is increased and supplementary elections are held, it may increase disputes. It is requested that the National Government be advised to find other solutions." Regarding the Legislative Yuan members, it was believed that "increasing the number of members has the same difficulties as the above case. It is proposed to advise the National Government that it can be handled in accordance with the party nomination supplement measures decided by the State Council before the election and the party's previous resolutions on nomination." These two review reports will be submitted to the tenth temporary meeting on the 24th for discussion so that a decision can be made.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zuoxiang's Remarks</h3>
<p>The Current Situation in the Northeast is Not a Matter of People; I Will Go to Take Office as Soon as the Order Arrives</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 23rd] After the announcement of Zhang Zuoxiang's new position as Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, he told reporters on the 23rd: "The crisis in the Northeast is deep. The current issue is a matter of events, not a matter of people. Military strength must be strengthened so that politics can develop and coordinate. I will go to Shenyang as soon as the clear order arrives." Zhang said that he was born a soldier. If he has the power to fight, it is his duty to the country and the region. What the future holds depends on whether the Central Government has a solution. Zhang sighed that the local and puppet Manchukuo forces were not well controlled after the victory, which led to them falling into the hands of bandits, resulting in the current situation. He believes that the cultivation of local armed forces in the future must be supported by the Central Government.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] After the implementation of the constitution, the central government will have new adjustments to the finances of each province so that each province can achieve financial self-sufficiency as an autonomous unit. The Ministry of Finance has now drafted a "National, Provincial, and County Tax Division Method" and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content is to redistribute the current tax sources and greatly increase the allocation of local tax sources to enable self-sufficiency. The method also has detailed regulations on the percentage of land tax and business tax allocated to the provinces.</p>

<h3>Supplementary Measures for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Elections; Legislative Yuan Proposes Review Opinions; Submitted to the Tenth Temporary Meeting for Discussion and Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The Legislative Yuan held its ninth temporary meeting at 11:20 a.m. on the 23rd. Chairman Sun Ke discussed the supplementary measures for the first National Assembly and Legislative Yuan elections passed by the State Council on the 22nd. These two measures were ordered by the National Government to the Legislative Yuan to revise the relevant election laws and regulations. However, the attending committee members, including members of both the Min and Qing parties, believed that the method of using legislative procedures to solve political problems violated the spirit of the rule of law. At the beginning of this constitutional government, they repeatedly emphasized that it was not possible. Moreover, there were many difficulties in increasing the number of occupational groups and holding supplementary elections. One was the issue of the candidates' membership, the second was the issue of the occupational groups nominating their own candidates, the third was the issue of holding elections, the fourth was the issue of controlling the number of votes, and the fifth was the issue of allocating the newly added seats. Therefore, whether these two measures can resolve disputes and appease people, so that those who should be elected can come out, is not certain. It is possible that it will cause more disputes and destroy the law. Tan Tiwu also pointed out that the various regulations in the supplementary measures could not eliminate all the disputes of concession, and the election was delayed for too long, which inevitably caused problems. In particular, the regulations on attendance were even more neither fish nor fowl. She advocated that the government should determine the principle rigidly. Those who get more votes should be elected in accordance with the law. Those who are formally nominated by political parties as candidates should also be elected in accordance with the situation. Zhang Zhaoyuan also said: "Mistakes are inevitable on the road to democracy, but knowing that we have made a mistake, we cannot make the mistake worse and make it impossible to recover." He and Di Ying and others advocated that it be submitted for review first, and then a serious decision should be made. Sun Ke also generally agreed with the views of the committee members, but because the authorities intended to make this case legally established before the closing of this National Assembly, so that the Legislative Yuan could meet reasonably, the implementation of the constitution would not be affected. It is not impossible to make another suggestion, but it is feared that time will not allow it. The original intention of the Legislative Yuan was that the National Assembly part could be resolved by the National Assembly itself, but in the end it was discussed by the Legislative Yuan. After reporting on the State Council's discussion and passage of the case, he asked the committee members to reconsider. In the end, because the matter was of great importance, it was decided to hold a review meeting first, and then hold a general meeting for discussion. The meeting adjourned for a while. A plenary review meeting was reconvened at 4 p.m. Liu Kejun presided. Lu Fu, Chen Ruxuan, Chen Xiaocen, and others expressed their opposition to the two cases. Lu Fu explained that the constitution and general laws and regulations have very strict restrictions, and there is really no way to think of it from the legislative aspect. The way to solve the problem should be sought from the party and government that caused the dispute. Chen Ruxuan appealed that the Legislative Yuan is about to end, and it must not commit crimes knowingly and make itself a laughingstock. Chen Xiaocen emphasized that he had made a similar suggestion three weeks ago, but it was not discussed because it was not convenient to intervene. Now that the problem has been delayed until now, the National Government's move is just like a joke. He pointed out that there are only two ways to respond to the National Government for the two cases: to report that there is no way to think of it, or to suggest Tan Tiwu's method. Li Qing, Shi Ze, and others also said that now there is only the party and the government.</p>
<h3>National Army Moves South from Yan'an and Arrives at Ganquan; The War in Central Shaanxi Becomes Tense; Bandits in Western Hubei Stir Again But Have Been Repulsed</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Correspondent, 23rd] The National Army moving south from Yan'an has arrived near the county seat of Ganquan.

<h3>National Assembly Chronicle: Preliminary Vice Presidential Election</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent] The Vice Presidential election competition unfolded today at the National Assembly Hall, the arena of democratic politics, with preliminary displays of skill. All six candidates seemed well-prepared, giving the impression of equal strength. Early in the morning, on the way to the National Assembly Hall, slogans promoting the candidates fluttered in the wind, each with its own appeal. Inside the venue, campaign materials of various colors fluttered in every corner, some as frank as "Please vote for me!" Most noticeable was Li Zongren, fully armed, greeting and shaking hands with people at the entrance of the National Assembly Hall. Also noteworthy was Mrs. Li Zongren, Guo Dejie, urging, "Please elect Mr. Li!" Perhaps this was somewhat successful, as the preliminary results showed Li Zongren taking the lead.</p>
<p>The Democratic Testing Ground</p>
<p>The Vice Presidential election was more enthusiastic than the Presidential election, and the enthusiasm revealed a strong tension. For this preliminary round, the presidium of the National Assembly selected the highly respected President of the Examination Yuan, Shi Jitao, to serve as chairman for the day. When he sat solemnly on the chairman's seat in his blue robe and black jacket, the representatives all had the same thought: "Today, we have come to the democratic testing ground."</p>
<p>The election voting procedure was clearly more skilled than the previous two times. After the Secretary-General read out the names of the representatives invited to serve as ballot distributors, ballot counters, and other supervisors, the various segments proceeded quickly. From the time the Secretary-General announced the start of ballot distribution at 10:10 a.m. to the time the first representative cast the first ballot into the ballot box, only a little over a minute passed. From that time until the last ballot was cast, it took a total of one hour. All the ballots were also sealed. More than 2,000 ballots were cast calmly, with only a few representatives showing their marked ballots to others to show their sincerity, which caused dissatisfaction among other representatives and led to a minor commotion. This was the only minor disturbance in the venue today.</p>
<p>The ballot counting procedure for the Vice Presidential election had an additional step: reading the ballots aloud. Many people said that those with heart conditions should not sit here. The twelve ballot boxes were opened one by one, and each ballot was read aloud. The candidates were startled each time their name was read. The ballot counting began at 11:30 a.m., and the reading of the ballots began at 11:45 a.m. Each word and sentence tightened everyone's heartstrings. The preliminary results showed that Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian had qualified for the second round, with Li receiving the most votes, followed by Sun, and then Cheng Qian. Yu Youren was behind Cheng and lost his qualification for the second round. In the statistics for the twelve ballot boxes, the results of the first ballot box showed Li and Cheng leading, followed by Sun in third place. Later, the results of the second, third, and fourth ballot boxes showed Li Zongren still leading, but the distance between Cheng and Li gradually narrowed. Although Sun was still in third place, he was gradually falling behind in proportion. When the fifth ballot box was opened, Cheng Qian took the lead by five votes more than Li. Sun was still in third place. When the sixth ballot box was opened, Li regained the lead by one vote more than Cheng. From then on, Li never retreated. When the ninth ballot box was opened, Li was far ahead, and Sun also jumped out of third place to become the runner-up. At this time, Cheng's cheerleaders could not help but give a sarcastic applause, but Sun was only nine votes ahead. By the time the eleventh ballot box was opened, Li's vote count had broken the 700 mark, while Cheng had not yet exceeded 500. Finally, when the twelve ballot boxes were opened, Li won the championship, Sun the runner-up, and Cheng came in last. This tense situation lasted from 11:45 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. The more than two hours was not a short time, and the scene was quite wonderful, with the cheers of the competing cheerleaders rising and falling.</p>
<p>Unexpected Events</p>
<p>Among the various campaign materials at the venue today, two were particularly eye-catching: one was the "Who Will Win the Championship" portrait from the "Nanjing People's Daily," and the other was the editorial "Guangdong Representatives Will Not Vote for Sun Ke" in the "National Salvation Daily." The former was more interesting, while the latter angered the Guangdong representatives. As the tense ballot counting was underway inside, the vandalization of the "National Salvation Daily" unfolded, creating an even more tense scene. After completing their task of casting their votes, the Guangdong representatives went to the "National Salvation Daily" to question and vent their anger, and the "National Salvation Daily" was eventually vandalized. Does this incident provide a significant irony to the democratic politics that unfolded today?</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] He Min, a farmer representative from Shanxi, wore a short blue cloth jacket with a front opening and blue cloth pants, making him the most simply dressed person in the entire venue. When this gentleman left the voting booth, he told people, "I circled four people in total," seemingly quite pleased with himself. Little did he know that he had actually "cast a void ballot."</p>
<p>The visiting foreign diplomats praised the orderly conduct of the election and the "calm and cheerful atmosphere" displayed by the representatives.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Expanding the Rationing of Readily Available Supplies</h3>
<p>The manufactured goods that the government has purchased were first put up for auction by the Central Trust Bureau, including items such as coal briquettes, soap, matches, cement, and other items, most of which are daily necessities for the people. The auction was conducted through open bidding, with the highest bidder winning. However, for some reason, it is said that the auction was not successful at the time. We sincerely hope that this auction method can be improved.</p>
<p>When the government ordered the Four Banks to purchase finished products between January and February of this year, after the industrial loan program was suspended, it originally had two purposes: one was to replace industrial loans so that manufacturers could cope with the urgent needs of the Lunar New Year, and the other was to control materials, especially general daily necessities, to suppress prices. Whether this high-priced auction method is consistent with the original intention of suppressing prices is worthy of further discussion.</p>
<p>To suppress prices, the government has in the past released major items such as rice, yarn, cloth, and gold. The effect of this is debated, but the sale price was always somewhat lower than the market price. Even for items such as sugar, coal, cooking oil, and flour, which were only rationed and not sold, the rationed price was far below the black market price. Therefore, in terms of results, it had a considerable effect in alleviating the continuous rise in prices. Even if adjustments were made from time to time and prices could not be completely controlled proactively, it would at most only follow the black market, which is very different from leading the price increase.</p>
<p>Now, the method of open bidding with the highest bidder winning has a very different effect, because it is completely based on the market price, and completely based on the highest market price. According to the bidding instructions, only the lowest reserve price is stipulated, and there is no maximum limit. Moreover, if a bidder who does not reach the highest bid price this time needs to purchase the remaining quantity of the same product, it will also be calculated at the highest price. Therefore, under this open bidding method, in reality, only price increases are allowed, and price suppression or leveling is not allowed. How this method can be reconciled with the original principle of controlling materials and suppressing prices is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>I remember that when the purchase of finished products first began, many people were skeptical, believing that this alternative to loans was no different from taking advantage of people's difficulties and competing with manufacturers for materials. After the purchase, it was no different from changing merchants' hoarding into official hoarding, and the so-called suppression of prices was nothing more than empty talk, and it was unlikely to happen in reality. If we take the highest-priced auction method as an example, wouldn't it be unfortunate that their words came true?"</p>
<p>The deadline for various banks and bureaus to accept applications for the purchase of finished products was February 7th of this year. At that time, the wholesale price index in this city was only between 200,000 and 240,000 times the base, but now it has risen to more than 500,000 times. In just two and a half months, it has risen by about one and a half times. Using the funds of national banks and bureaus as capital, without having to spend too much interest and risk, this business is indeed very profitable. However, since the profits are thick and the income is large, if the interest rate is slightly reduced and the method of selling at parity prices is still adopted, the national treasury would only earn a few cents less, and the general price level could be slightly stabilized, or at least not be stimulated by it. Then, not only would people's lives be benefited invisibly, but also the national credibility and the value of the currency would all receive good effects.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the cost of living index for workers, because the increase has been too drastic, manufacturers cannot bear it and have requested changes. The only reasonable solution that everyone believes is to start with expanding rationing, so that the index can be more stable, and workers can avoid unexpected problems. The problem is, where can these materials be obtained? The relevant authorities have held many meetings, but there is no concrete solution, and it seems that this route is still blocked. We believe that since the number of finished products obtained through purchase is not small, and among the originally scheduled seventeen kinds of finished products, fourteen kinds are daily necessities for the people, and these necessities are currently firmly in the hands of the government, then, it is only necessary to change the original plan of selling at the original price and follow the example of rice, cooking oil, sugar, etc., to give priority to supplying rations, and this problem can be easily solved. We wonder whether the recent labor-management appraisal meeting in this city resolved to request government assistance regarding the issue of expanding the rationing of materials. We believe that the most convenient way to provide assistance is to use this batch of finished products that have already been purchased and hoarded in warehouses.</p>
<p>This will of course entail considerable losses for the government, but as mentioned above, at most, it will only earn a few cents less, and it will not really lose money or deplete its legitimate profits. Moreover, expanding rationing is an established policy of the highest authorities, and various localities are vigorously promoting it. Even the supplies donated by the Allied nations and some of the products of merchants are also being coordinated separately to jointly assist in its realization. We have no reason to believe that this batch of purchased finished products, originally intended to suppress prices, must all be excluded and sold to bidders who are willing to pay the highest price. Mr. Patrick, the representative of the American side of the Sino-American Relief Materials Committee, stated in his work report, based on the opinions of his experts, that "in order to exert its full strength, the government should strive to achieve real improvement in the utilization of major necessities of life produced domestically and imported, supplemented by appropriate price controls." (See yesterday's newspaper) The real improvement in utilization referred to by Mr. Patrick undoubtedly refers to the supply of rations. Moreover, if these domestically produced necessities of life are sold using the highest-priced auction method, then there will be no supplementation of appropriate price controls. Therefore, this highest-priced auction method, whether based on expanding rationing or controlling prices, should be carefully considered.</p>

<h3>U.S. Economic Adjustment Agency Prepares to Implement Aid to China Plan; Shanghai American Business Community Hopes to Participate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The European Recovery Agency, which also manages aid to China, has now been formally renamed the Economic Adjustment Agency. Authorities at the agency announced today that they have begun deploying personnel to implement the aid to China plan, but aid to China funds will not be submitted to the Appropriations Committee until the decision on aid to Europe funds is made. After the negotiations between China and the United States reach an agreement, the aid to China portion of the agency can begin work. Although the nature of the aid to China has not been specified by the agency, officials said that it will focus on providing loans to support China's economic construction, rather than engaging in relief efforts through grants. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai has requested permission for American businessmen familiar with the situation to participate in this plan through voluntary assistance, emphasizing the welfare of the Chinese people and cultural undertakings. It is said that economic recovery is important, but the interests of the United States in China should extend beyond the economic scope and be broadly considered, especially paying attention to organizations established in China on a voluntary basis and educational and religious undertakings supported by the United States. These groups feel oppressed by bureaucratic authorities, the same as merchants. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai also suggested that "the future of American cultural cooperation in China clearly includes mutual aid programs initiated by American private individuals, and the American government should provide full support when these private cultural and religious groups struggle to survive. The Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce should also organize an advisory committee to assist the work of the Economic Adjustment Agency. The director of the agency should also be given the authority to approve import permits for goods aided by the United States issued by the Chinese import authorities for regulation." A. B. Coleman, director of the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce, is scheduled to return to Shanghai on Monday. It is said that the Economic Adjustment Agency is giving sympathetic consideration to this proposal from the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Defenses of the Dabashan Mountains on the Border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun of this Newspaper</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th (Airmail)] Since the bandit troops of Kong Congzhou infiltrated and captured Baihe County in the Hubei-Shaanxi border area on April 1st, and then besieged Xunyang along one route and fled south to Shuanghekou, Deshengpu, and Tanjiahe in western Hubei along another route, controlling the two counties of Zhuxi and Zhushan, the defenses of the Dabashan Mountains on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei have suddenly become a matter of concern for people across the country. The Dabashan Mountains stretch for more than a thousand li from Guangyuan in the north to Wuxi and Wushan in the east. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the communist bandit Xu Xiangqian's troops harassed Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, infiltrating through Zhuyu Township in Tongjiang and Wanyuan counties, along Guanba Township and Gunlongpo, capturing Wanyuan, Chengkou, Xuanhan, and Dazhou, lasting for two years. The National Army's defense in the Dabashan Mountains began in October of last year. The communist bandits once infiltrated Ankang in southern Shaanxi, and the Chen-led troops of the Youth Army were dispatched from Chongqing to Danzhong to recover it. If they had taken the opportunity to join forces with the Chen-led troops to pursue and attack Kong's bandit lair in Yunxi County, the situation on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei today would not be so serious.</p>
<p>There are three main routes for the communist bandits to infiltrate Sichuan: (1) Gunlongpo, which is only sixty li from Wanyuan County and is the closest rocky path to Zhenba in southern Shaanxi. Gunlongpo is 1,000 meters above the ground and has a precipitous terrain, with sheer cliffs. In the 35th year of the Republic (1946), Luo Guangwen's troops used this route to leave Sichuan to suppress the bandits. At that time, many people and horses fell and died because the path had not been paved properly. Now, it is still impassable when it rains. Cotton merchants from Zhenba must pass through Gunlongpo to enter Sichuan. The Yiyang troops are troubled by the fact that they cannot inspect the merchants carrying goods back and forth. Intelligence officers have already found pistols hidden in the cotton. Furthermore, the merchants and civilians who carry yellow paper out of Sichuan can reveal all the defenses. Transportation between southern Shaanxi and northeastern Sichuan is inconvenient, and rumors are enough to affect morale and the overall situation. Therefore, even though it is known that there are bandits mixed in, it is impossible to seal the border. (2) A branch road from Lishuxi to the northeast through Pihuo Pu to Dazhu River is the main route for entering Sichuan from Ziyang. The locals call this road "Ren Ba Yan [People Climbing Rocks]." (3) Entering Sichuan through Jixinling in Wuxi County.</p>
<p>This reporter has personally observed the defenses of the Dabashan Mountains and can confirm that they are indeed as solid as a rock. However, in addition to the three main routes listed above, there are still fifteen small paths on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei. The communist bandits are cunning and always avoid the strong and attack the weak, which is worth our attention.</p>
<p>In response to the communist bandits' attempt to infiltrate Sichuan, the Chongqing Xingyuan (Provisional Headquarters) established two command posts in Guangyuan and Dazhou, respectively, led by Generals Huang Yin and Fang Jing. According to observations by relevant authorities, the communist bandits' biggest goals on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei are still: (1) Along the Xunyang, Ankang, Ziyang, and Zhenba lines, attack Guangyuan to control Chengdu. However, with the recent sitting of Lieutenant General Luo Guangwen, commander of the Fourth Corps and director of the Tenth Training Department, in Hanzhong, the communist bandits' plan will definitely be shattered. (2) After capturing Zhuxi and Zhushan, continue to flee south to block the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to the threat of communist bandits, there is also a serious opium bandit problem plaguing the border areas of Wanyuan and Chengkou in Sichuan, and Ziyang and Langao in Shaanxi. The famous Liu Ba Dao He and Dajieling have become "no man's lands" because they are adjacent to four counties. The famous opium bandits include Zeng Ce'an (from Shaanxi), Chen Yutang, Chen Kaiguo, and Xiong Jiwu (from Sichuan), who possess hundreds of guns and have seriously harmed local security. According to Wanyuan County Magistrate You Weitan, the four county magistrates have decided to hold a meeting in Dazhu River on April 25 to thoroughly eliminate opium and survey the boundaries.</p>
<p>The potential of the communist bandits in Sichuan must not be underestimated. Bandit leaders Zhu De, Wang Weizhou, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng all grew up in Sichuan. After Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and others withdrew from Chongqing in the 34th year of the Republic (1945), they dispersed bandit party cadres to various counties in the countryside. Chairman Wang Lingji inspected this issue on the second day (6th) of his arrival in Chongqing from Xunyang. According to reports, the young children who were abducted by Xu Xiangqian's bandit troops from various counties in northeastern Sichuan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) have now grown up and returned as infiltrators.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Luo Guangwen, commander of the Fourth Corps, served as the commander of the Fourteenth Army in Chongqing during the war and was responsible for suppressing bandits in Sichuan. He said that it is impossible to eliminate bandits without implementing the "three killings" policy. His three killings policy is:</p>
<p>(1) First, kill undisciplined officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>(2) Second, kill township and town chiefs who collude with bandits.</p>
<p>(3) Finally, kill all the bandits.</p>

<h3>Six Arab Nations Plan to Send Regular Troops as Reinforcements; Situation in Pakistan is Serious; British Attempt to Mediate in the Haifa Conflict Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 23rd] Britain will make another mediation attempt on the 23rd to get the Jews and Arabs in the Haifa area to agree to a truce. The previous truce talks broke down last night after 24 hours of intense fighting between the two sides. The Palestinian government stated today that British troops should withdraw from Palestine as quickly as possible and do not want to be involved in disputes with either side. However, if anyone interferes with their withdrawal, British troops will not tolerate it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Haifa, 22nd] The Jewish underground army today controls Haifa and has proposed peace terms, demanding that all Arabs disarm. The Arab side believes that it is difficult to accept these terms and is preparing to withdraw from here. At the same time, all of Jordan's and most of Iraq's and Syria's supplies are imported from Haifa. Now that the port has been occupied by the Jewish army, the Arab countries may intervene entirely. According to Arab spokespersons, King Abdullah of Jordan will not allow Haifa to fall into the hands of the Jews. According to news from Cairo, the governments of the six Arab countries have agreed to send troops to Palestine on May 16 for large-scale operations unless the United Nations can produce an acceptable solution beforehand. The Arab League admits that it has underestimated the strength of the Jewish army. Da Mase Guangbao and Liang Di Telegram also stated that Jordan may send Arab troops to participate in the war. It is reported that Arab volunteers have entered Pakistan to provide reinforcements. Ten to fifteen thousand Arab residents of Haifa have gathered at the port waiting to be sent to Acre. British authorities stated that another 18,000 to 25,000 people will also be evacuated. Arabs must surrender all weapons at the time of departure. On May 15, when Britain ends its mandate, the British will transfer them to the Jewish underground army as spoils of war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 22nd] Although the main Arab defense works in the port of Haifa have been broken, the Arabs are still resisting stubbornly. The Haganah army continues to provide reinforcements to defeat the final Arab resistance and occupy the entire port. Arab women and children have boarded small boats from the port and evacuated to Acre in the north. The truce talks between the Jews and Arabs in the Haifa area will continue on the morning of the 23rd at 11:00 a.m. Haifa has a population of 145,000, with Arabs accounting for slightly more than 40%. According to the Palestine partition plan, Haifa should be an Arab port.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Damascus, 22nd] Syria has instructed its representative to the Political Committee of the Arab League in Cairo to demand that regular Arab troops be sent to Palestine immediately, before Britain ends its mandate over Palestine. Iraq's Regent Elah left for Amman on the 22nd to discuss plans to aid Palestine with King Abdullah of Jordan. Elah will stay in Amman for ten days. The Iraqi Minister of Finance, the Minister of Defense, and Chief of Staff General Saeed will all participate in the talks. Earlier, General Shafwat, commander of the Arab Liberation Army in Palestine, stated that although the Arab army in Palestine can continue to fight, it urgently needs the practical assistance of the Arab League countries. He advocated sending regular Arab troops to the Holy Land to establish peace and order.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Truman said at his weekly press conference today that the United States is willing to provide some military force to organize a United Nations police force to be sent to Palestine.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Foreign Office and the Colonial Office both denied knowing of the presence of Soviet troops in Palestine. Long Wei claimed that one of the illegal immigrants spoke Russian and was a communist. This matter has been confirmed. This person was found among 12,000 immigrants who were all detained on Cyprus Island yesterday.</p>
<h3>US Asks British Troops to Continue Staying in the Holy Land; British Government Has Refused; Suggestion of US Trusteeship is Being Considered</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 23rd Broadcast: A Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain is considering President Truman's proposal regarding Palestine, but denied that the Holy Land issue was discussed at yesterday's cabinet meeting, and strongly stated that Britain's attitude towards the Holy Land has not changed. The "Star" claimed that the British cabinet has rejected the US request for British troops and administrative personnel to continue staying in Palestine after May 15, but Britain may support the US proposal for the United States, Britain, and France to jointly administer Palestine.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Success Lake News, British representative Jones gave a speech to the UN Political Committee today. He did not directly answer the US proposal to place Palestine under trusteeship but said that Britain might consider this proposal. He also said that there are only 25 days left before Britain withdraws from the Holy Land, and the United Nations must quickly find a way to stop the war in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Success Lake, 22nd] The UN Political Committee resumed debate on the Palestine issue today. French representative Baroti requested immediate measures to make Jerusalem a refuge for refugees. Mr. Ba proposed a resolution requesting the Trusteeship Council, in consultation with the mandatory power and related countries, to take all necessary measures to protect the city of Jerusalem and its residents.</p>
<p>Yugoslavian representative Virfen opposed the US's proposed trusteeship plan for Palestine. Australia requested the United Nations Palestine Committee to immediately establish a provisional government committee and organize a militia, and requested the Palestine Committee to join this provisional government committee in taking over the administrative responsibilities of Palestine starting on May 15. Ukrainian representative Tarasenko demanded the implementation of partition and firmly opposed the trusteeship plan. Brazilian representative Muniz supported the trusteeship plan and pointed out that in order for this solution to be effective, a powerful country directly related to the Palestine issue must establish an agreement to implement the trusteeship plan. Otherwise, the plan may have little hope of success. Jewish Council Executive Member Sherfer accused the mandatory authorities of refusing to cooperate in implementing the partition plan and even failing to take responsibility for local security. He believed that it was already too late to implement the trusteeship system now, because the Arab countries are prepared to take even larger-scale military action after the end of the mandate. Delaying a solution can only make the situation worse.</p>

<p>46 People Have Been Killed So Far</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 23rd] Since the communist-controlled riots broke out on Jeju Island at the southern tip of Korea on April 2, the riots and sabotage have been increasing.

<h3>Hu Shize Discusses the Need for Reunification of North and South Korea in Pyongyang</h3>
<p>Pyongyang Conference May Have Little Hope of Success</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] Hu Shize, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and Secretary-General of the Korean Commission, commented on the Korean issue in Pyongyang today, saying that, in essence, this is a US-Soviet problem. The internal situation in Korea is also quite complicated, so the North-South conference in Pyongyang has little hope of success. The South Korean general election on May 10 will still be held as planned. Hu pointed out that the Society for the Promotion of Independence led by Syngman Rhee in North Korea and the Democratic Party led by Kim Shin-sook are both powerful majority parties, and neither of them participated in the North-South conference. The Pyongyang conference will inevitably produce some conditions for the union of the North and South. Whether these conditions can be accepted by the two parties mentioned above, and even whether Kim Koo and Kim Kiusic agree, is also a question. But he still strongly stated that the agricultural South Korea and the industrialized North Korea need each other to complement each other, and it is necessary to unify. When asked if the people of South Korea were satisfied with the rule of the United States, Hu replied: The Koreans have a strong sense of patriotism and are disgusted with the control of the United States and the Soviet Union in North and South Korea. Hu has not returned to China for three years and has not been to Peiping for fourteen years. This time, he returned to China to sweep his father's grave in the north. He will stay for a few more days and then go to Shanghai. Whether he will go to Korea to observe the Korean general election or return to Success Lake has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>Introducing Churchill's New Book</h3>
<p>— Memoirs of the Second World War</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in New York, 16th Dispatch] Winston Churchill, the wartime Prime Minister of Britain, has released his "Memoirs of the Second World War." It has been simultaneously published in the New York Times and Life Magazine starting from April 16th. In Britain, it is also being exclusively published by the Daily Telegraph from the same day.</p>
<p>Since the news of Churchill's dedicated writing of his memoirs spread, it has attracted great attention from the world. This is because Churchill bore the heavy responsibility for the safety of the British Empire during the Second World War. Naturally, he has the deepest knowledge of the formation, development, and various behind-the-scenes aspects of this war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he has many retained confidential documents and diaries that can be utilized. Many historians believe that only two people are most qualified to chronicle this great war: President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. With Roosevelt's unfortunate sudden death before the war ended, Churchill's memoirs will naturally become the most closely watched historical material of the Second World War.</p>
<p>This memoir is very long, divided into five volumes, with plans to publish one volume every half year. The first volume is titled "The Gathering Storm," which chronicles events from 1919 to 1939. It is further divided into two parts, the first part is "From War to War," and the second part is "The Twilight War." Each part is further divided into sections. The New York Times's publication on April 16th was the first section of the first part of the first volume, titled "The Follies of the Victors."</p>
<p>Before the first section, Churchill himself wrote a short preface, saying that this memoir can be seen as a continuation of his previous book about the First World War. If the two are read together, it can be said to be a chronicle of another "Thirty Years' War." He humbly said that what he wrote is not history because history should be left for the next generation to write; however, he firmly believes that these memoirs can make a considerable contribution to modern history for future use.</p>
<p>In the last paragraph of the preface, Churchill mentioned that one day, Roosevelt said that he was consulting on what name to give this great war. He (Churchill) immediately replied: It should be called "The Unnecessary War." Because this war, which shattered the essence of humanity, could have been avoided. In this long war, we sacrificed millions of precious lives. Justice has finally triumphed, "but peace and security have not been achieved and are in worse danger than what we overcame in the past." Therefore, he hopes that the lessons of the past described in these memoirs can become a guide for future generations so that the next generation will not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>The content of the first section of the main text, "The Follies of the Victors," begins with the situation at the end of the First World War, including the conditions in France after the war, the Rhineland issue, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the lack of importance attached to the issue of compensation, Clemenceau's downfall, the United States' non-participation in the League of Nations and the growth of isolationism, the Anglo-American naval disarmament, and the failure of the victorious countries to prevent Germany from rearming, and so on. Churchill expressed deep regret for the victorious countries' excessive leniency and slow actions after the First World War, which allowed German militarism to revive in the cracks.</p>
<p>This first section is already quite long, occupying an entire page. The second section published on April 17th is about the Locarno Pact, the economic crisis of 1929, and his relationship with Conservative Party leader Baldwin, and so on. The New York Times publishes one section daily, except on Sundays. The first volume may be serialized in this way for five weeks before it is completed.</p>

Recently, due to the case being exposed, relevant departments in Nanjing telegraphed the Shanghai Garrison Command, ordering his arrest and transfer to Nanjing for interrogation.

<h3>The Yang Jingzhou Disappearance Case: The Taiwan Police Department is Thoroughly Investigating; The Key is Whether His Ticket Was Seized When Boarding</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Taipei, 23rd] The Taiwan Provincial Security Authorities have not yet received a report on the Yang Jingzhou disappearance case. However, Deputy Director Lu of the Provincial Police Department and Chief Chen of the Criminal Affairs Department are conducting a thorough investigation. The first step in the investigation is whether Yang Jingzhou's ticket was seized when he boarded the ship on the 10th. According to the Keelung Port Authority, he did board the ship safely, but whether his ticket was seized needs to be investigated. The Port Authority stated that they had heard that Yang had considerable debts in Shanghai. The Police Department has decided to conduct an on-site inspection of the ship after the arrival of the People's Ferry on the 25th. Furthermore, according to Xingtai Company, Yang arrived in Taiwan on the 5th and stayed at the company's candy factory on Roosevelt Road. On the 6th, he lost the company's certificate for applying for an exit permit. On the night of the 7th, he suddenly claimed to be ill and asked a factory employee to accompany him to Guji Hospital for treatment. However, according to the doctor's diagnosis, there were no symptoms. He was prescribed a sedative solution, which he did not take. Based on this, it seems that he was mentally disturbed. He left the factory on the morning of the 9th and did not return all night. On the morning of the 10th, he returned to the factory, had breakfast, and went out, presumably to Keelung. On the 13th, a telegram was received from Shanghai, informing them of his disappearance. On the 16th, a missing person advertisement was published. Yang's father-in-law came on the 28th to inquire but found no clues and expressed his wish to the company to assist in the aftermath. The clues in this case seem to depend entirely on whether his ticket was seized. The Taiwan Police Department also hopes to learn about Yang's life.</p>

<h3>Bank Employee Sells Gold; Police Division Captures Suspect Through Disguised Entrapment Based on Tip</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command's Economic Section cracked down on a group of people involved in the black market trading of gold yesterday. All of the suspects have been arrested and, after interrogation, will be transferred to the District Court for trial within days. The section received a tip a few days ago that Wang Xinbao, an employee of a certain bank in the city, was engaged in the black market trading of gold. Chen Mo, the head of the Economic Section, immediately sent personnel to investigate. However, because his trading activities were secretive, it was difficult to get started. After consulting with a certain organization, they decided to set up a room in the Yangtze Hotel to entice him to buy gold. At 11:00 AM on the 22nd of this month, members of the section negotiated the purchase of nine large bars of gold, priced at 395 million yuan per bar, totaling 3,545 million yuan, to be delivered at the Dekang Foreign Firm at 190 Jiujiang Road. Wang Xinbao immediately led a person named Zhu Delin, carrying nine large bars of gold, to deliver the goods. Director Chen had made arrangements and personally led five officers to follow them. When they were delivering the goods, they were immediately arrested. Zhu was taken to Xinbao's residence and confronted with him. After he confessed without hesitation, both the person and the goods were brought to the department for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Treasury Bill Sales: The Key Lies in Interest Rates [Our Report]</h3>
<p>The issuance of short-term treasury bills is imminent, and the National Bank authorities have high expectations for this. However, according to observations from financial circles, the interest rate on short-term treasury bills is still lower than the market interest rate. At a time of volatile prices, it may not be effective in absorbing idle funds. It is recalled that the sales of US dollar treasury bills, denominated in US dollars, were not greatly affected by commodity prices, yet their sales were not as ideal as expected. Therefore, excessive expectations should not be placed on the role of short-term treasury bills. In the future, most of the issued treasury bills, except for a portion listed as securities, will likely still be underwritten by Shanxi silver firms and money houses.

<p>According to Mr. Wang Xingyao, a prominent figure in the national goods industry in this city, the recent export of cotton cloth has been temporarily impossible due to the impact of the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate and low overseas market prices. Customers who placed orders in Shanghai have not yet submitted them. Domestically, due to sluggish actual sales, many cloth factories in the Wuxi area have suspended night shifts. Even smaller cotton weaving factories within this city have mostly suspended night shifts. Currently, in the national goods industry, not only is cotton cloth difficult to export, but also general merchandise. It can be said that everything is in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>Ample Market Chips: Cotton Yarn Market Weakens Further</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by ample chips due to the previous day's distribution of yarn from the China Textile Construction Corporation. Customer sales remained sluggish, and the local market was also stagnant. Appetite among traders was weak, and the market trend weakened further. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened and immediately fell below the 230 million mark, dropping to 227 million yuan at closing, a further drop of 3 million yuan compared to the previous day. Sai Guang and Shui Yue also continued to fall slightly by 2-3 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn opened in the morning with offers to sell at 148 million yuan. Although there was some boosting from retail investors and trading desks, it briefly touched the 150 million mark. However, due to oversupply, it lacked the strength to rise and closed near 147 million yuan, a further decrease of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn generally fell by 5-6 million to 4-5 million yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a downward trend as the China Textile Construction Corporation was distributing cloth again, and private dyeing factories also offered a large supply. Customer sales channels were narrow, and those who had hoarded goods mostly sold them off, causing the market to decline. 12-yard Dragon Head fine cloth opened with offers at 4.9 million yuan. Due to oversupply, it declined all the way to 4.86 million yuan at closing, a further decrease of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths such as Color Ball and Five Blessings also fell by 40-70,000 yuan. Markets for other products such as serge, bleached cloth, grey cloth, and domestic cloth also softened.</p>
<p>It is also reported that purchase orders for Five Blessings fine cloth supplied by the China Textile Construction Corporation were being sold at a discount of 30,000 yuan, and someone was willing to sell Dragon Head fine cloth for 4.85 million yuan.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Yarn Sales [Our Report]</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Corporation opened sales of cotton yarn yesterday (the 23rd) as usual, with 14 varieties available. A total of 240 applications were received, and 622 pieces of cotton yarn were sold, equivalent to 1018 pieces of 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>The assessed prices for each yarn were as follows: 20-count Jin Bao Xing 125 million yuan, 10-count Deputy Blue Phoenix 74 million yuan, 10-count Li Ma 74 million yuan, 16-count Red Moon 99 million yuan, 20-count Immortal Peach Grade 2 124 million yuan, 32-count Immortal Peach 164 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Immortal Peach 173 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Abundant Harvest 179 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight 178 million yuan, 40-count TK Color Ball 212 million yuan, 60-count Sunlight 228 million yuan, 60-count Double Strand Sunlight Mercerized 298 million yuan, 100-count Double Strand Sunlight Mercerized 1.3 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Weakens</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw sluggish sales of cotton yarn, causing prices to decline. Sentiment was weak, and sellers were eager to unload their goods, causing offers to fall. Buyers were unwilling to purchase, and offers were even lower, leading to a fluctuating trend and mediocre trading. 400 bales were traded. Haiti premium cotton for public warehouse delivery was offered at 18.7 million yuan, Jingyang at 25 million yuan, Laohekou at 22.1 million yuan, Huoji at 18.4 million yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 4.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Xuanwei Sells Well</p>
<p>Sales of Xuanwei woolen cloth have been quite brisk recently, with local customers showing significant demand. In terms of color, light colors are the most popular. The selling price is lower compared to other woolen serge, mainly due to the impact of smuggled goods from the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Each time a steamboat arrives in Shanghai from Hankou, it brings a considerable amount of goods, with three-quarters being Xuanwei woolen cloth, leading to a daily decline in market prices and creating an oversupply. Yesterday, Xuanwei woolen cloth brought from Hankou to Shanghai was offered at 4 million yuan per yard, while the China Textile brand sold for 3.75 million yuan, Jardine Matheson and Xie Xin sold for 4.3-4.4 million yuan, American goods for 4.6-4.7 million yuan, and British goods for 5.7-5.8 million yuan.</p>

There was little intervention from the National Bank, and banks also made some purchases. Rumors about the exchange rate started again, and the price was pushed up to 1,980 yuan near closing, closing at 1,975 yuan. Compared with the morning close, all stocks showed a slight increase. The gains and losses of unlisted stocks outside the market were still minimal.</p>
<p>Government bonds were stable yesterday, with a turnover of approximately 4 million. Unified Class C bonds opened in the morning at 100,400 and rose from 100,300 to close at 100,800, a slight increase of 1,000 yuan compared with the previous close.</p>

<p>Part of the Students at Fudan University Boycott Classes: Protesting the Search: Wu Mayor Thoroughly Investigates, No Police Department Personnel Sent to Search the School [Our Report]</p>
<p>More than 500 students from some departments of National Fudan University (out of a total of more than 3,000 students) announced a class boycott yesterday to protest the illegal search by unidentified persons the day before, and decided to continue the class boycott for another day today. The remaining 2,500 students continued to attend class as usual yesterday and today. The incident occurred because about 20 students from the school held a work review meeting for the Music Festival concert in the Hanyuan Tea House on Guoquan Road near the school at about 1:00 PM on the 21st. Three unidentified persons came forward to search the meeting host, Yang Guichang (a second-year student in the Department of Journalism), and seized two copies of the meeting minutes and three personal letters from Yang. This aroused the anger of the students, and yesterday they announced a class boycott in the name of each department, and continued the class boycott for another day to show their protest. The school has telegraphed Principal Zhang Yi, who is attending the National Assembly in Beijing, urging him to return to the school immediately to deal with the matter.</p>

If the police are performing official duties there, it cannot be regarded as illegal. Dean He told reporters that as of 5:00 PM yesterday, neither the school nor any student had been able to definitively prove that anyone had illegally searched the dormitories. If it can be proven, the school will respond to the students' demands.</p>
<p>Wang Zhaoxin, the chief of the Xinshi Street Police Sub-bureau, issued a statement last night, explaining that the sub-bureau had not received any orders from superiors to enter Fudan for a search, nor had it sent anyone to Fudan.</p>

<h3>Severe Recession in the Cigarette Industry: Two-Thirds of Factories Shut Down</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to industrial sources, the cigarette industry in this city is in a deep crisis. To date, the number of cigarette factories that have partially or completely ceased operations has reached two-thirds of the total. Last month, the city's cigarette production was 120,000 cases, while in the first half of this month, production was only 30,000 cases. According to industry insiders, there are two reasons for the crisis: First, the citizens' purchasing power is weak, while cigarette prices are high, leading to sluggish sales. Second, the tax burden is too heavy. Currently, the tax rate for goods is 100% of the price. Before March, the tax price was adjusted every three months, but now it has been changed to monthly adjustments, thus increasing the burden.</p>
<h3>Mint Lays Off Employees</h3>
<p>After the Central Mint resumed operations, it retained approximately two hundred employees. The factory has now announced that all workers will be laid off by the end of March, and approximately seven-tenths of the staff and security personnel will also be laid off. However, the amount of severance pay is still under dispute between the two parties and has not yet been resolved.</p>

<h3>Textile Industry Moves to Hong Kong to Establish Factories: Some Have Already Started Operations; Estimated Total Number of Spindles is Approximately 300,000</h3>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the financial industry, as of now, more than a dozen Shanghai yarn magnates have established yarn factories in Hong Kong. The estimated total number of spindles could reach 300,000. More than 1,000 spindles have already been installed and put into operation. Several thousand more spindles are being installed. It is expected that more than 10,000 spindles will be in operation by the end of next month. Based on current production costs and market prices in Hong Kong, each bale of cotton yarn can earn approximately HK$500, and there are no import and export restrictions. All foreign exchange earnings can be freely used. However, according to observations from relevant parties, once the domestic economic situation improves and prices stabilize, yarn factories relocated to Hong Kong may find it difficult to compete with domestic yarn factories. The reason is that the Hong Kong government has strict regulations on factory management and worker welfare. For example, female workers cannot work night shifts, child labor cannot replace adult workers, and there are clear regulations on workers' wages, food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Furthermore, in addition to Indian cotton, only American cotton can be ordered as raw materials. At the same time, due to the local climate, factory equipment is susceptible to humidity, and the installation costs are also higher. Therefore, all costs are higher than in the mainland. But at present, it is indeed an opportunity to make a profit, but the impact on the national socio-economy is not small.</p>
<h3>Minor Fluctuations in Market Prices: Rice Prices Tend to Waver; Active Sales in the Oil Market, Turning from Sluggish to High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice prices in the north and south markets fluctuated, but the changes were small, and the trend remained wavering. When the south market opened in the morning, prices were lowered again due to the decline in Wuxi prices and the difficulty for sellers to sell. The morning market once fell by 100,000 yuan. Later, after learning that prices in the north market were rising, the decline stopped and prices became firm. As a result, high-quality white japonica rice fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, medium and lower-quality rice fell by 50,000 yuan, and thin indica rice rose by 50,000 yuan. Merchants in the north market took advantage of the low prices and absorbed supplies, raising prices by 50,000 yuan. The total arrivals in the two markets were 3,552 shi.</p>
<p>Flour continued to decline, and retailers frequently sold off their stocks, as it was rumored that the Civil Food Allocation Committee would resume the allocation of flour, resulting in ample supply and little demand. Military ship flour opened at 1.34 million yuan, the lowest was 1.33 million yuan, and closed at 1.355 million yuan, a decrease of 25,000 yuan. Lao Che flour was the same price as military ship flour. Red Bee flour fell to 1.3 million yuan, wheat bran fell again by 5,000 yuan, and wheat factory prices fell below the 2 million yuan mark to 1.98 million yuan.</p>
<p>The prices of miscellaneous grains fluctuated. Yellow beans were patronized by buyers, and sales were slightly active, rising by 50,000 yuan. The supply and demand of corn were equal, and the market was stable. Mung beans had stopped selling to buyers and fell sharply by 200,000 yuan. Red beans also fell, while selected green beans for local sales remained stable and prices leveled off. Sesame was similar to the previous day, and peanut kernels were bought by Cantonese merchants, with Qinhuangdao peanut kernels jumping by 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking oil prices rose, and buyers took advantage of the low prices, leading to active sales. Soybean oil rebounded, rising from 8.45 million yuan to 8.58 million yuan, an increase of approximately 180,000 yuan. Raw oil rose by 250,000 yuan, with raw oil in drums rising to 9.8 million yuan. Raw sesame oil increased by 200,000 yuan, and there were very few transactions for raw vegetable oil. Small-scale sesame oil rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Although Cantonese merchants did not buy soybean cake oil, prices also rose by 20,000 yuan due to increased market confidence.</p>
<h3>Siamese Government's Rice Control Plan Cancelled After Negotiations with Overseas Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] It is reported that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, feeling that overseas Chinese grain merchants in Siam were inconvenienced by the Siamese government's strict management of rice exchange and transportation, requested our Consulate General in Bangkok to investigate the implementation.

<h3>American Rice Shipped to Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Market News from Various Places</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, 23rd of This Month] Rice prices in Suzhou continued to fall today. The opening price for rough japonica rice was 3.3 million yuan, and the opening price for white japonica rice was 3.67 million yuan. Retail prices in rice shops also automatically decreased.</p>
<p>[Report from Wuxi, 23rd of This Month] Commodity prices were weak before becoming firm today.

<p>[Report from Chengdu, 23rd of This Month] Commodity prices in Chengdu are fluctuating. Rice, grain, gold, silver, and general merchandise are rising. On the 23rd, rice was 4.8 million yuan per double shi. The provincial government is urgently investigating and registering large households hoarding grain and setting a deadline for selling at parity prices. Municipal police arrested a large number of gold and banknote black market merchants in the market last night and sent them to court. Speculation has subsided.</p>
<h3>Active Sales in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>Although sales of domestic tea to Tianjin merchants were sluggish, there was still continuous demand from local merchants and from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places, leading to active sales. In terms of prices, various types of aged tea remained firm in the face of scarce supply and demand. As for this year's new tea, prices have been hovering near the source due to the continuous arrival of supplies, but the foundation is not solid. As for the foreign tea market, sales have gradually become quiet. American sales are stagnant, and North Africa, a French territory, also has sufficient supply, causing buyers not to purchase. However, sellers' minds remain resilient, and the market can stand firm.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Prices Fall Due to Ample Supply</h3>
<p>In the kerosene market, Mobile and Asia Petroleum and other companies have distributed large quantities of kerosene in barrels, with an allocation price of only 1,000 yuan per barrel. As a result, there is more capital in the market, and most transactions are done by dealers breaking bulk. High-grade barrel oil was traded at 15.5 million to 16 million yuan, while kerosene in cans was only traded at 1.8 million yuan. Sellers are loosening their grip, and the market is weakening.</p>
<h3>Coal Stored in Qinhuangdao Awaiting Transport</h3>
<p>Fuel Management Tries to Contact Ships</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to sources from the Fuel Management Committee, regarding the purchase of 200,000 tons of coal, enough to meet the city's needs for one month, Chairman Zhang Xi of the committee went to Beijing to negotiate with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Four Joint Office. An agreement was reached in principle that the Four Joint Office would provide loans to purchase the coal, which could be realized in the short term. Furthermore, due to the small number of ships this month, not much coal has arrived. As of now, only 70,000 tons of Qinhuangdao coal and more than 10,000 tons of Taiwan coal have arrived. The coal stored in Qinhuangdao has reached 90,000 tons, and the amount in Taiwan is also increasing daily, urgently needing to be transported. The Fuel Management Committee is actively trying to contact ships.</p>
