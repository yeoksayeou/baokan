<h3>蔣夫人明日可抵華府　將推進援華新運動　杜魯門馬歇爾仍在檢討援華問題</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕蔣夫人到達美國後，預料將推進新運動，促美國加緊援華。新運動之內容雖不可知，但多數專家認爲夫人將根據下列兩種正大理由，要求美國全面援助，卽：（一）中國政府目前並非僅在彈壓內亂，且正代表美國及共他全體民主國家擴大抵抗共產主義。（二）美國職責所在應供給中國政府所需之援助，挽回局勢。就美國言，此乃不可多得之機會。當初美英蘇雅爾達協定規定蘇聯在中國東九省獲得若干鐵路，港口與基地權利，實爲中共後來在東北得勝之原由，卽此一點，美國亦應援助中國，以補償過失。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕蔣夫人訪美任務之能否成功，似厥賴於民間及國會方面之反應，而非美政府對國民政府之冷淡作任何迅速轉變。官方承認蔣夫人此行成功之希望，端在渠給予國會及民意方面之影響。蔣夫人十二月一日可抵此，諒將被邀出席國會諸委員會或聯席會議，陳述中國之需要，立法步驟現不能迅速採取，但蔣夫人之意見可影響一月間新國會之行動。在等待南京方面對蔣夫人此行之更多消息期際，現尙無在白宮或國務院正式招待蔣夫人之計劃，據中國官員等稱，彼等預料蔣夫人此行爲期「甚暫」，蓋中國情勢嚴重所致，蔣夫人諒將籲請美國發表擁護國民黨政策之明白聲明，並聲明美國官員更積極參預戰略事宜，及立卽增加軍事經濟援助之援華計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕蔣夫人親自向美國會呼籲更多援華經費之希望廿九日大見加增，兩院聯合監督外援委員會共和黨主席斯密司參議員稱，渠將審愼考慮邀請蔣失人星期五川席作證之建議，按此建議爲民主黨衆議員勃魯姆所提出者。勃氏卽將繼任新國會衆院外交委員會主席，此點頗可重視。勃氏對於美政府遲未大規模支持蔣總統之反共戰爭一節。並地直接批評。但渠稱國會已聽膩國民政府腐敗之論調「如中國需要更多軍事配備，吾人應以適當人士加以處理，吾人必須要做點事」。參院外交委員會內共和黨要員魏勒亦督促國會聽取蔣夫人之陳述，渠主張由參衆兩院外委會舉行聯席會議，蔣夫人則出席作證。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿九日電〕美國加緊援華問題，今日仍在杜魯門總統與國務卿馬歇爾審愼檢討中，未有最後決定。衆議院外交委員會主席伊登率直向記者稱：「余不知如何能繼續援助中國而使其立刻生效，蓋中國問題乃國際糾紛，非任何明哲所能逆料其前途」。此言可代表美國官方見解，但絕非缺乏援華熟誠之謂。美國人所顧慮者惟恐全面援華使美國經濟不勝負担，故必考慮周到。南京方面指責馬歇爾不能給中國適當援助，華盛頓方面亦已知之。惟自大勢觀之，美國必將給予中國合理援助，同時鼓勵中國以自身力量打開出路。</p>
<h3>紐約每日鏡報力促援華抗共</h3>
<p>否則美本土必有戰爭</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿九日電〕美赫斯特系之每日鏡報今日社論稱，美國之首要任務爲防止蘇聯假中共之手征服中國，此項工作若不能成功，則美美國本土遲早必有戰爭。中國如失敗，蘇聯卽可以中國人民爲砲灰而征服全亞。如是美國將完全與其他太平洋國家斷絕關係，夏咸夷亦將極爲危險。</p>
<h3>蒲立特過厦抵穗</h3>
<p>曾經鼓浪嶼視察海港</p>
<p>〔本報廈門廿九日電〕蒲立特今偕我外部參事陳岱礎，由滬專機來廈市長黃天爵等赴機塲歡迎，在廈午餐後卽往鼓浪嶼視察海港，並登日光岩視察全市形勢，對記者所提問題，拒絕發表意見，三時半乘原機赴穗。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿九日電〕浦立特廿九日下午飛抵穗。</p>
<p>〔中央社福州廿九日電〕蒲立特今晨自滬乘「建國」號專機於十時十五分抵榕，勾留一小時許，下機後由閩主席李良榮陪同驅車觀遊市區一週，十一時廿五分乘原機飛厦。</p>
<h3>泰興口岸鎭一度陷匪　陸海軍反擊收復　鎭丹揚交界三角區散匪肅淸</h3>
<p>〔本報江都廿九日電〕軍息：匪蘇中軍區梁靈光部三個團，廿八日續犯口岸，國軍以衆寡孵殊，一度失守，旋經泰興國軍星夜馳援，江防海軍同時趕往砲擊，在二十時內收復口岸，匪傷亡過半，已向寺巷口及江都沿江一帶潰竄。</p>
<p>〔本報泰興廿八日電〕（遲到）匪靖泰獨立團及軍分區特務團，結集二千之衆，於廿七日夜十時許，分襲口岸·龍窩口兩地據點，該地守軍縣保安隊曁國軍一個連，兵力雖少，尙能沉着應戰，激戰終夜，砲火熾烈，江口兵艦雖發砲助戰，匪仍頑抗不退。泰興錢縣畏親率地方團隊，配合國軍岳團，於廿八日拂曉分兩路挺進口岸，馳往援救。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿九日電〕鎭江·丹陽·揚中交界三角地區之龜山頭，大路鎭，大港鎭，錄影家橋，石橋頭一帶，經交警大隊週來不斷搜剿進擊，殘匪已望風遠竄，現於地等漸入安靜狀態，商肆重見繁榮，民衆安居樂業。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿九日電〕海軍部今日派兵艦六艘，巡弋長江下游，檢査船隻，以防共軍潛入。</p>
<h3>立法院繼任院長競選　逐鹿者開始活動　傅斯年聲明渠不擬參加</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕孫科決定出長政院後，其所遺立院院長職務，將由何人繼任一問題，頗爲一般人士注意，各方對立院各會社連日頻繁之接觸，亦深饒興趣，蓋依據憲法規定，立法院長人選，應由立委互還產生，今春立院初集會時，孫科以無匹優勢膺選院長，而副院長競爭亦至爲激烈，現院長一職因孫科出長政院而出缺，新院長互選日期，雖尙須俟孫科正式提出辭職後方可確定，然逐鹿者均已開始競選之活動。今春爲冬數北方立委擁戴被動參加副院長競選，成爲陳立夫可畏之勁敵之傳斯年，竟聲明在任何情况下。渠不擬參加競選，而當時躍躍欲試，幾有擊敗陳立夫之聲勢之黃紹竑，亦默默無聞，是以主要之競選者實爲陳立夫與吳鐵城兩人而已。陳爲現任副院長，其所領導之革新俱樂部，廿九日曾集議商討競選問題，吳在立院亦具有甚大潛勢力，其擁護者所組之民主自由社，廿八日亦曾開會，對競選凖備預爲布置。據日前情勢推斷，吳將獲得國民黨少壯份子立委各集團如新政俱樂部一四座談會等之支持，若然，其實力當可與陳之革新供樂部相抗衡，是以在新院長互選前，雙方競選之決勝焦點，將為超然份子之爭取。記者獲悉，在第一會期猶爲一盤散沙之衆多超然份子立委，在第二會期中已自動形成一極民主之組織，此組織名爲諍友社，以客觀超然民主優秀相標榜，每星期三由十餘社友委員邀約茶話會，廣泛交換意見，迄今已兩月餘，渠等努力，已藉程序委會及大會中之運用，加大近來立院之議事效率，廿九日該社部分委員宋述樵，洪瑞釗，樓桐孫等，曾公開表示對新院長互選問題之意見，渠等認爲：「國民黨爲立院內之多數黨，値此敵人迫近，孫內閣尙待組成之際，非恃多數黨各派系之堅强團結，不足以應付緊急危機，立院爲憲法上政治重心，不宜因院長之競選，而使多數黨內部黨員自傷感情，增加分裂，蹈過去副總統及副院長選舉之覆轍，故一致主張由國民黨中央提名候選人，以免因黨內同志競爭增加紛擾，影響戡亂」。就目前情勢觀察，諍友社所持有之百餘選票，實已使彼等在新院長互選之競爭中，有舉足輕重之概。記者廿九日曾詢該社某委員，倘國民黨中央不擬提名候選人，則彼等究將支持何人，某委員答稱：此問題自將於一日該社茶話會上論，及渠個人意見，諍友社對此一抉擇，決無先天之成見，革新俱樂部及民主自由社殆皆由努力獲得諍友社之選票，然截至廿九日止，前者似略佔優勢。</p>
<h3>經濟配合委會日內開首次會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕經濟配合委會日內將舉行首次會議，該會秘書長一職，已內定由抹維英氏出任，林氏已自美返國抵港，正候機來京。該會主任委負，依組織法規定由院長兼任或由院長指定，現已決定由孫院長兼任，委員人選除組織法之規定者外，新任財部政次沈元鼎（明令廿九日發表）亦爲其中之一，並負重要責任。沈氏定三十日來京。</p>
<h3>糧商採購外糧輸入　將一律免進口稅　滬各粉廠生產狀況好轉</h3>

<h3>霍華德系報紙評論　孫科組閣孫友善姿態　美不能踟躕不進　張發君勱稱民社黨不參政　靑年黨立委盼發揮民力重建幣信</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿九日電〕霍華德系報紙社論，廿九日頌揚孫科之出畏行政院。又稱：中美傳統友誼之是否能維持不墮，「端在吾人，故吾人不能踟躕不進。」社論稱：孫氏組閣乃對美友善之姿態，蓋孫氏留學美國，素具西方頭腦又為自由派中堅。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張君勱昨對往訪記者發表談話稱：此次內閣改組，民社黨決以在野黨之地位，以冀對國家有所貢獻，故並不考慮參政。孫院長此次組閣後，灤望國民黨內部各派系自行團結，現階段之政治固須革新，惟外交方面主要仍須靠本身，本身振作則外援自來。內政方面，一切措施，希望能尊重制度及法律，應儘量起用新人，使政治有新氣象，用人須憑人才主義。各地方省主席應賦予實權，卽中央政權下各部門做事之人，亦應賦予相當權限，俾勿須事事請決於總統。同時，有關軍事一切措施，固屬重要，惟須注意，收拾人心尤屬重要。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立法院新聞室息：靑年黨立委李公權，蘇汝湛，史亦仁，董微等頃發表對孫科繼任行政院長之意見稱：翁院長辭職已經快要一月，直到廿六日，總統才提出孫哲生先生繼任，立法院當卽以最大多數同意票通過。我們對於孫先生繼長致院的意見是：（一）孫先生歷來主張民主政治，抗戰以來，對於推進我國的民主憲政，很有貢獻，此次出任行憲後第二任內閣，我們希望孫先生對於憲政規模多多樹立。（二）翁院長提出辭職以後，外邊有所謂「戰時內閣」的傳說，此種體制，爲了加强行政及作戰力量，自無不可，惟希望不要影響立法院的權責，而爲違反憲政之措施，相信孫先生長行政院以後，當能注意及此。（三）政府過去措施，往往對於民衆加以防範，使民力愈來愈弱，如現在各省的民衆自衛武力，比較過去就差得很多，我們希望孫先生上台以後，對於培養民力，發揮民力，要放手去作，只要政府自信其所爲是的確爲人民，人民自會擁護政府。（四）政府以往失信於人民的次數太多，最顯著的如過去黃金儲蓄和此次幣制改革，現在修正金圓劵發行辦法，兌換金銀，是爲的重建幣信，重立幣信，我們希望孫先生組閣以後，能切實施行，以「昭大信，示大公」。（五）最後，我們見到孫先生滯留滬上，自然爲了組閣的凖備，但當此時機迫切，似不可多所稽延，尙盼卽日返京，成立新閣，以慰全國人民之望。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕孫院長以足疾未愈，昨晨已入中比　錠醫院動手術，爲孫氏治療者，有吳桓興及林白惠兩醫師。據悉，開刀經過，極爲良好，日內卽可出院。惟在住院時期，遵醫囑需要靜養，故不接見外客。</p>

<h3>遠東防共的國際聯合陣線　——不妨從上海開始——</h3>
<p>中國反共戰爭的大局，演變至於今日，實有參照北大西洋防共協定的成例，迅速締結遠東防共的國際聯合陣綫的必要，而上海允爲最好開始之塲所。</p>
<p>蔣夫人前晚已飛美呼籲加强援華，明天可望卽抵華府。杜魯門總統和馬歇爾國務卿仍在繼續檢討援華如何有效問題，尙無最後决定。據紐約電稱，從大勢看，美國必將予中國以合理的援助，同時也必鼓勵中國人自助。卽此可知：吾人求助於美國，必以努力自助爲基礎。國人果能自助，深信友邦——尤其是美國，必能助我；國人果能自助，則凡愛好民主，和平，自由的國家必都願量力以助我。如此，則遠東防共的國際聯合陣綫，必可望其在中國締結成功。因爲，民主國家如不欲阻遏共產主義的蔓延則已，否則斷不能唾手以讓共產黨統治中國，進而控制整個亞洲。</p>
<p>遠東防共聯合陣綫，中國固爲其先鋒，美國應爲其後盾之主力，而若英，若法，若荷，若澳，若菲律賓，若印度，若越南，若緬甸，若暹羅，若韓國，——乃至覺悟以後的日本，凡不願使遠東人民淪於共黨之手喪失自由生活的權利者，都該次第結合起來，完成堅强的防綫，以與赤色鐵幕相抗。須知共產國際指揮下之各國共產黨，實爲其世界革命的工具，原屬一體，並無國界；民主國家間假使還不能相諒相助，撲滅此逐漸燎原的大火，終必焚及其自身！</p>
<p>昨天大美晚報社論主張：當此美人考慮對華决策之際，吾人應獲得一在華之國際聯合陣綫（a　firm　United　Front　iu　China）。這固然站在美國報人立塲，爲美國設想之辭，但也確有此必要，可謂實獲我心。誠如大美晚報所說，英人一方鼓吹美國續予中國以堅强有效之援助，而一方竟有英人宣稱，彼等將留在上海，「繼續商務」，不論其地淪入何人之手，則美人有如救人的俠客，爲人火中取栗，萬一失敗，身受其災，而他人可藉「中立」以獲其利。在今日，如果還只打着可能與共產黨貿易的小算盤，而忽視整個世界赤化，改變人類自由生活方式的大禍，無論何國，將來必噬臍無及。馬來亞共黨的跳梁，英國人難道還沒有看明白嗎？卽以中國而言，東北寳藏爲共黨所佔、勢必斷送於蘇聯，而長江流域以及華南，英國商人的利益，或且多於美商，他們豈能夢想在共黨極權控制之下還可分一杯羹嗎？如果英人有眼光的，一定不作此想。誠然，英國人民總得先顧歐洲，然而在遠東如欲保持自由貿易，究不能不及時與中美通力合作，組成防共的聯合陣綫；賊然，美國資力獨富，可以多負大任，而照常理推斷，英國亦何嘗可以置身事外？</p>
<p>至於中國，則赤火現已燒及堂奧，及時自救，尤爲國民人人應有之責任。就政府言，此時萬不能隨便作後退的打算，須知「我能往，寇亦能往，一故必須堅强的站定，痛切的自責，然後喚汗大號，呼籲全國人民，無分男女老少，無分南北東西，無分敵前敵後，只要不願做赤色奴隸的人們，都應自動起來，堅强反共，與殘暴的匪徒不共戴天。誓必打到共黨匪徒放下他們殺人的武器而後已。就人民言，首先應認識這反共之戰，是自由生活方式與奴隸生活方式的戰爭，是獨立與滅亡的分水嶺。共黨所控制的地區，不但共產而且公妻，來自匪區的難胞，都可言之鑿鑿，循此以往，不但亡國，且將滅種。凡稍有中國歷史觀念，受過傳統文化的薰陶者，當能憬悟於赤禍之遠過於洪水猛獸！假使人人只以逃避爲能事，自謂或可苟全生命，殊不知大地沈淪，焉有個人托足之所，只要奮發自助，大家團結起來，出錢出力，勦匪戡亂，纔可救自己，救國家，救人類，救世界。倘還有人以爲將來共黨來了，我們仍可以自由貿易，還可以自由談話，還可以自由保有財產，自由維持生命，那簡直是不可思議的夢囈—今天要求國際友邦助我，天大只仰望着美國怎樣，英國怎樣，而返顧自身，却絲毫無所作爲，甚至拔一毛而不爲，這還成什麼話？故國際防共聯合陣綫在遠東——在中國之形成，應由我中國人民首先自己努力幹起。</p>
<p>上海是一個有百年以上的國際都市，中國最大的通商口岸。租界制度，不平等條約，中外人士自都不願見其復活，然而上海幾百萬的居民中，有中國人，也有各國的僑民，英美法三國的僑民爲尤多。中國人民在上海的固不當隨便搬遷，卽外僑亦何必任意撤退。右的是人力，有的是物資，有的是海陸空的交通，只要大家團結起來，在上海先締成國際防共的聯合陣線，我們不信沒有地方自衛的能力，更不信沒有救中國救世界的把握。事在人爲，天助自助，願吾全市全國愛國家愛自由的同胞，以及維護民主自由的友邦，共起圖之！</p>
<h3>徐蚌前綫民衆極為沉着堅定　國軍士所之旺亦為前所未見</h3>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿九日電〕戰火與蚌埠之距離似更接近，民心仍極安定，淮河鐵橋上英勇健兒來回絡繹，市民均以興奮之神情圍觀，娛樂塲所亦照常營業，除市塲中正式交易稀少，袁大頭及黃金價格上昂；以及少數學校開始變相停課，稍予人刺激外，此間幾不知六十華里以外已展開一對國家民族具有決定性作用之大會戰之序幕。惟軍事當局刻已積極力行肅奸防諜工作。</p>
<p>記者團觀感</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市記者訪問團於廿五日出發赴徐州前綫訪問，歷時四日，業於廿九日由徐轉京返抵滬，記者團此行深感「百聞不如一見」，前綫民衆之堅定沉着，與謠言紛傳之後方恰成反比例。歷史性之徐州會戰，國軍已完成初步勝利，第二次大會戰，刻已在津浦南綫宿縣東西地區形成，軍事重心亦自徐南移，徐州剿總劉峙總司令現坐鎭蚌埠指揮。劉氏在徐接見記者時指出，徐州會戰實爲華中戰塲整個之決戰，意義非同平凡。據發表，匪軍在第一階段之戰鬥中，傷亡之總數約十五萬人以上，國軍傷亡約爲九萬人。本月中旬，徐州一度頗吃緊，當時執行指揮之杜聿明將軍，迅將邱淸泉兵團自西綫東移，接應黃百韜兵團，扭轉戰局，實爲戰略上之一大成功。身經百戰之杜將軍，對目前進行之第二階段戰事，極具信心，渠稱，現在聚集宿縣東西兩方之陳毅，劉伯承匪部，必將再碰一個大釘子。渠以樂觀之語調稱：津浦南段短期內決可打通。渠並稱：此次陸空軍與戰車協同作戰之成就，打破剿匪戰爭以來之紀錄。杜氏檢討匪情，認爲我應集中一切人力物力於前方，澈底實行總體戰，以對付匪之總體戰，實爲當前最急要之事。記者等以兩日之時間，分別巡視東南兩方戰塲，會見邱淸泉與孫元良兩兵幽司令官，並於第一綫戰壕內參觀國軍作戰，目睹國軍攻克匪陣，如置身戯院觀戰爭影片者然。國軍配備精良，士氣旺盛，均非被脅作戰之匪軍所可比擬，京滬兩慰勞團團長張道藩，方治分率各團員，親至火綫慰勞士兵，創慰勞工作以來未有之成績，官兵感奮，收效甚著。</p>

<h3>中立國調解柏林爭端　向四強提出新方案　主張幣制統一先達成協議俾柏林封鎖得以同時解除</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕據今日獲悉：安理會主席阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞在今晨法代表巴洛迪英代表買德幹及美代表傑塞普訪渠時，渠已向三國代表提出另一新方案，以圖解決柏林問題。按同一新方案已於昨晚由勃氏提交蘇代表維辛斯基。</p>

<h3>梅汝璈對記者縱論　日戰犯裁判經過</h3>
<p>東條等判處死刑，十一國法官爭得面紅耳赤，最後以六對五的一票多數，決採用絞刑。</p>
<p>以法律觀點看，日本天皇無法洗刷他的戰犯嫌疑。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿八日航訊〕東條，板垣，土肥原與松井等日本首　戰犯被判絞死刑後的第一個星期天，記者在佔領軍要人羣寄宿的帝國飯店內，見到遠東國際軍事法庭的中國法官梅汝璈博士。</p>
<p>梅法官是担任起草長達一千二百十八頁的法庭的歷史的「判決書的七位盟國推事之一。據他自己說：自從本年四月左右法庭審訊完結，進入草擬判決書的階段後，六個月來，他的生活就活像是書本的蠢虫，鑽　在堆積如山的近數萬頁的法庭證件與文書中。</p>
<p>與記者談到東京裁判的歷史的意義，梅法官首先指出裁判規模之大，與歷時之久，在人類數千年來的司法史中，創一嶄新的紀錄。</p>
<p>遠東國際法庭在近兩年的審訊期間，總共開庭八百餘次，呼喚證人近千餘人。「有些證人，是從中國，蘇聯，蒙古，英國等遠遠地趕來東京，出庭作證的」。提出證據，近四千八百餘件，全部法庭紀錄，長達五萬頁，九百六十八萬二千字，化去費用，超過七百五十萬美金。</p>
<p>在這一點上，梅法官說，東京裁判，不能不說是人類史上最大的裁判，而其一千二百頁的判決書，也是有史以來最長的判決書。</p>
<p>東京裁判在其判決書中，不僅確守侵略戰爭，爲國際犯罪重視個人的戰爭責任，並且進一步判定對於軍隊所犯的暴行，文官閣僚，應與軍隊的指揮官員，負有問樣的責任。</p>
<p>梅法官認爲這表現東京裁判，比紐綸堡裁判更爲前進，也是東京裁判對近代國際法的更進一步的貢獻。</p>
<p>梅法官接着爲記者很詳盡地解剖，與解釋東京裁判的長約一千二百餘頁的判決書。</p>
<p>判決書的最初的一百頁，是叙述裁判的經過與程序，及確定裁判中適用於各個被吿的法律根據。接着的五百頁，可以說是日本軍閥的侵略陰謀史，它指出日本軍閥，怎樣地奪得政權，支配政權，與發動一連貫的侵略戰爭。</p>
<p>在另外的五百頁判決書中，對日本的一連串的侵略戰爭作個別的歷史的陳述，其中二百五十頁，是關於中國部份的。</p>
<p>最後的一百餘頁，則可以說是日本軍隊的暴行史，南京大屠殺被指爲人類文明史中「最最醜惡的一個事件。」</p>
<p>從判決書的頁數的比重上，梅法官指出國際軍事法庭，對日本對華侵略戰的重視，法庭認爲日本軍閥的陰謀與一切侵略戰爭均自東北事變開始。這一點，梅法官說不能不說是一個「最公正的歷史上的新案」。</p>
<p>對二十五個被吿的判刑的輕重，也是從這個斷定出發的，梅法官說在七個被判絞死刑的戰犯中，至少有五個是與侵華直接有關的，製造東北事變以「特務頭兒」而聞名於全中國的土肥原賢二；一度夢想做「中國皇帝」的板垣征四郞，南京大屠殺首腦松井石根；與「廣田三原則」的作者廣田弘毅；東條英機的主要罪名，固然是發動太平洋戰爭，可是他於關東軍時代，在東北的罪跡，與任日本陸相時代，堅持繼續侵華的政策，也是使他獲得絞死刑的重大罪狀。</p>
<p>與紐侖堡裁判相較，有人說東京裁判的判刑太嚴，有人又說太輕。紐侖堡裁判中有三個被吿被判無罪，而在東京裁判中，除重光葵與東鄉茂德二人被判有期徒刑外，其餘的二十三名被吿，全部被處死刑，或禁錮終身。從這一點來看，則後者較前者實爲峻嚴，但單從被判死刑的被吿數的多寡上來看，後者似乎又較前者寬容得多。</p>
<p>據梅法官的解釋，判處死刑這一個問題，是十一國法官意見最爲分歧，爭辯最烈的一點，十一個法官所代表的十一個國家的法律，各個不同，因此對於處刑的意見，也就各不相同。</p>
<p>在蘇聯與新西蘭兩國內，早就廢止死刑，因之兩國的法官，當然極力反對判處戰犯死刑，英國與澳洲，已局部廢止死刑，因之兩國法官，也就不願意投死刑票，澳洲法官甚至主張流放戰犯至荒島上，至於印度法官，則從頭到底，反對審判戰犯，主張無罪釋放全體被吿，因之，在全體法官會議，討論到判處死刑這一個問題時，大家爭得面紅耳赤，烏烟瘴氣。最後到投票決定時，才好容易以六對五的一票多數，通過採用絞刑。</p>
<p>談到這兒，梅法官用右手把他的玳瑁眼鏡往上推了一下，說：爲了這個問題，我不知在同事間化了幾多工夫與心血，整整地一個星期，我担心得連晚上覺沒睡好。假如對這幾個罪大惡極的日本侵華軍閥的頭兒連死刑都判不成，我還有何面目回去見江東父老呢？</p>
<p>最後關於日本天皇的戰犯嫌疑問題，梅法官向記者發表了如下的談話：</p>
<p>「從純粹的法律觀點來看：日本天皇是無法洗刷他的戰犯嫌疑的。在二年半的審判過程中，我們得到無數的證據，足以證明他卽使不是日本侵略戰爭陰謀的發起人之一，至少他是一個消極的陰謀的參加者。這一點，卽足够構成他從犯的罪名。</p>
<p>我們法官，祗能審判與判決名列檢察偵訴狀中的被吿，天皇之名，不在起訴書內，法庭便無法加以裁判。至於爲什麼他不被起訴，那恐怕是一個政治問題吧」。</p>
<p>梅法官指出日本天皇與天皇制度，是兩件事。波茨坦宣言中，雖給予日太人民以選擇政府制度（包含天皇制度）的自由，却並沒有給日本人，或任何人以包袒日本天皇戰爭責任的權利。</p>
<p>就是麥帥，身爲盟軍最高統帥，也沒有權利或資格宣言日本天皇裕仁的無罪。梅法官强調地說。</p>
<p>「要斷定裕仕天皇之有罪與否，從合法的觀點來看，是祗有在一個國際性的法庭內解決的」。梅法官說。</p>
<p>遠東國際法庭，梅法官接着說，並沒有任何企圖想袒護裕仁天皇的戰爭責任。在判決書中，完全是事實的坦白的陳述，假如有人斷章取義，在判決書中，摘取一二段落，來做個人的主張的宣傳，那麼這不是遠東國際法庭所能負責之處，也是與判決書全文無關的。</p>
<p>遠東國際法庭庭長魏勃（立者），對廿五名日戰犯宣判時之神情。魏氏之右，爲我國法官梅汝璈氏。</p>

<h3>貼放委會昨議決　出口貸款即開始　外匯移轉證市價堅後回小</h3>
<p>中央銀行貼放委員會，於昨日中午特邀集各行局負責人士，舉行會議。出席者兪鴻鈞·劉攻芸·林崇　·李立俠·李叔明。等十餘人，由兪鴻鈞總裁親自主持，對恢復行局貸款問題，聞會中曾作兩項決議：（一）今後各行局貸款，仍以各該行局本身之存款內貸放，以不增加發行爲原則。（二）重要日用品及出口貸款，決定提早貸放。</p>
<p>又訊：外匯移轉證市價，昨猛升後回平，初做三十元，旋升至卅元五角，旋出口商供售踴躍，價又回平至廿八元七角五分。最後爲廿九元五角，成交較前增多。中國銀行僑匯掛牌升二元，爲卅四元。</p>
<p>昨日銀根較前稍緊，暗息升三角至三角五分，合月息九角至一元〇五分，今日爲月底，銀根可能續緊。</p>
<h3>存兌金銀數量　國行未加限制</h3>
<p>京滬等地以外，各地辦理存款兌現，當局已決定於明日起，凖時開辦。中央銀行日來正加緊金銀之裝運工作，迄至昨晨爲止，二十餘地所需金銀，均經該行以專機分別送往，平均每地均在黃金一萬兩以上。</p>
<p>據該行主管人員稱：日來本市因金價黑市波動，申請兌換者乃愈見踴躍，外間不明眞相者，乃有提高兌價及限制兌換之傳說，除調整兌價之說，已不攻自破外，所傳限制兌換量之說，亦可證實爲無稽之談。迄至目前爲止，中央銀行絕未規定兌換數量云。</p>
<p>兌換金銀更形擁擠</p>
<p>又訊：存款兌換金銀昨日更形踴躍，中央銀行及中交農三代兌行，均異常擁擠。中央銀行負責人稱：此次兌換，均須現鈔，因此淸點鈔票手續較爲麻煩，兌換時間不如理想之速。又兌換突然之增多，係由於黑市上漲，及香港黃金漲價所造成，一般觀察，如無特殊原因，黑市不致再有波動。</p>
<p>售出飾金並無限制</p>
<p>頃據本市銀樓業公會理事長吳彭年吿記者稱：關於報載該業因近日實出飾金數量頗鉅，爲限制起見，規定每日發給銅牌五十面，逾額停售等情事，殊非事實。惟多數同業因飾金來源問題尙未有解決，故均量入爲出，至購買飾金，並無限制，一錢至數兩均可。</p>
<h3>特殊情形行莊增資財部另訂辦法四項</h3>
<p>據悉：財政部爲關於有特殊情形，不能依照規定辦理增資手續者，另訂辦法四項：（一）凡總行及具分支機構，俱已在淪陷區者，准俟地方收復恢復營業後兩個月內，再行依照規定，辦理增資手　。（三）凡總行在陷區，而留有分支機構繼續營業於地域者，在總行未能依法調整資本時，暫准現有分支機構各依照所在地，最低資本額襟準之十分之一，繳存現金於中央銀行，滿三個月後發還。嗣後如有分支機構復業時，並應依照此項規定辦法，依總行所在地收復，恢復營業後，依於兩個月內，辦理調整資本手續，並將資本增達規定極準。（三）凡總分行所在地迫近陷區，無法營業，經自行停業，報部有案者，准於復業後兩個月內，再行依法辦理增資手續。（四）凡參有敵僞股份之銀行，其原爲敵僞股份，尙未依法處理完竣者，其資產增資部份，仍應依照規定辦理。至現金增賢都份，除其他股東應按其股份比例繳納外，敵僞股份准俟處理完竣後，一個月內再行補繳。此項敵僞股份在未處理完竣前，轉由部函請各該所敵僞產業處理機關派員代表行使股權。</p>
<h3>紗價穩定棉布盤堅</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，因賓銷依然狹隘，市勢堅後終回。四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開一萬三千元，嗣以交易尙佳，挺升至萬三千六百元，迨近收時，散戶吐售，喊價遂吿回低至一萬三千元結束，比週末微好一百元。</p>
<p>廿一支雙馬紗初開亦悄喊九千六百元，中途見低，卽有人進，曾高至一萬零三五百元。午收時以散戶獲利出籠供售較多，價亦回小至九千三百元收盤，軋升三百元。其他各支粗細紗，亦均微秀一二三百元不等。</p>
<p>棉布市勢晨開堅穏，十二磅龍頭細布喊開挺高十元，嗣因廣帮及漢口帮績有大量搜求，買氣濃郁，有貨者乘機扳持，價乃再吿盤升至四百廿五元，太街門莊扒吸步昂至卅五元，迨近午收，吸納較稀，浮戶了結不寂，喊價回小至四百六十元收盤，較週末回漲十五元。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰亦好十元，以四百十元結束，中檔五福細布喊三百七十元，喇叭童細布三百七十五元，均有成交。高檔一九〇士林布，廠盤開八百五十元，市面喊開七百五六十元有人要買，白貓大衆花布，廠盤開三百五十元，交易平庸。</p>
<h3>到貨旺·人心虛　食米跌勢未戢　粉糧食油多數回降</h3>
<p>食米跌風轉勁，到貨旺湧，昨日南北二市共計到貨一萬三千二百〇二石，產地報價下跌，人心虛軟，米店納胃奇少，求售不易，貨主抑價出售，價格猛跌。北市白粳低至四百元，較上週猛跌四十元，達一成之多。薄稻亦退至四百元，早稻祗三百七十元，其他秈米等一致下降四十元左右。南市白粳跌三十元，早稻降四十元，市勢甚虛。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>轉趨回降，因米價之報跌，加之錫市下游，人心不振，實銷縮手，價格乃吿下降頗多。老車粉初開卽跌至一百三十六元，繼再低至一百三十；四元，較上週六猛跌十五六元之多。兵船粉一百三十二元，亦降十元多，其他雜牌粉一致下降十餘元。麩皮亦降十元，退至八十元。</p>

<p>食油</p>
<p>價格又見下降，因米價之下跌，人心殊疲，本街納胃趨淡，市勢重吿萎靡。豆油初開七百六十，後再低七百五十元，猛降五士元。生菜油降落三四十元，爲六百元開出，生油降二十元，小車蔴油平定。豆餅銷呆，亦小三元。</p>

<p>食糖昨日市况走勢仍堅，本街帮納胃續暢，人心向昂，塲上求多供少，市况邁步上升。</p>
<p>45號車白糖，最開四二〇元，散戶拉抬不已，執戶觀望多時，喊價瞬息上升，盤旋於四四〇元左右，中間塲上售意鬆弛，買氣頓挫，價卽回落至四三五元，收市空方抵補，納冐重起，人心又趨上揚，曾見四五〇元，最後以四四五元了結。</p>
<p>台赤刁靑等貨，未見做開，中砂粗砂興化白高等，均昂升一五元至三〇元不等。</p>

<h3>徐州會戰第一回合　（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿六日快訊〕徐州會戰爆發的第三天，記者於赴京途中，路過鎭江，碰到該軍的軍務處曹尊賢處長，談到徐州東綫的戰况，曹處長曾向我表示：徐州會戰中，國軍穏可勝利。他告訴記者：他們的部隊在碾莊附近，他這次南返，因後方有軍需亟待北運，一兩日後，還要回到前方。當時我對曹處長說：「回到前方，請爲我向靖公（周軍長字靖方）問好！」</p>
<p>兩週來，會戰的重心，始終在東翼，於捷報頻傳聲中，記者一面爲國軍的勝利而歡呼，一面却也爲在東綫的幾位舊識將領，如邱淸泉·黃百韜，以及這裏所要寫的周將軍等人的安全而祝福。周將軍負偽回來了，這消息令我惦念他的健康，但是，更令我對周將軍的精神寄予無限的欽敬。</p>
<p>兩泰捷戰</p>
<p>周將軍是江西籍，軍校四期畢業。抗戰期中，以戰功累升至七十四軍五十一師師長，和張靈甫·李天霞兩氏，同爲王耀武的左右手。抗戰中期，在湖南編訓的第一百軍成立，卽由李天霞將軍和周將軍分任正副軍長。在戡亂的過程中，一百軍對全國同胞將不會是一個生疎的名字。共匪在蘇北兩泰地區發動他全面叛亂中的第一次攻勢，就是一百軍在當時特殊的環境中，對來犯的共匪，予以猛擊，粉碎他們企圖攻下揚泰，成脅京滬的夢想。更何况在其先（抗戰期中），一百軍曾獲到過軍委會頒發的最榮譽的武功狀達十七份之多，在其後的蘇北，魯南綏靖諸役中，一百軍更是每戰每勝的呢。一百軍之所以能以一支「新軍」（他的番號就是最後的一個，再沒有第一〇一軍了）。而有其光輝的部隊史，這顯然完全是由於李，周兩將軍之督帶有方之故。李天霞將軍現任第一綏靖區副司令官，他是去年夏季離開一百軍的，李將軍旣去，周將軍調升軍長，尤收駕輕就熟之效。</p>
<p>古黃河畔</p>
<p>今年三月陳毅匪部第二縱隊自魯南流竄蘇北，會同原在蘇北的第十一·十二兩縱隊企圖南下江干，遂其「五月渡江」的狂想。五月中，周將軍奉命率部自臨沂南下，重來蘇北，淸剿殘寇，記者隨該軍行動，曾一直打到在黃海之濱的蘇北共匪老巢—德鎭。陳毅部的三個縱隊，於狼狽殘破之餘，不得不化整爲零地逃竄到隴海路以北的地區去隠藏起來。記者前曾兩度追隨着他們這個部隊從事採訪工作，在戰馬上，在吉普中，周將軍輾轉於古黃河兩側，記者追隨在一起，達兩個星期以上。到了六月中，陳毅大部主力，自魯北竄抵魯西，又値兗州被共匪圍攻甚劇，周將軍所部復奉調金魚台一綫。</p>
<p>嚴肅深沉</p>
<p>就記者個人所接觸的將領羣中，周氏無疑地是有着嚴肅的生活態度的將領中之一位。記者與他相處的日子，合算起來，大槪總有三四個月，而記者始終沒有看到他賭博過一次。軍務之暇，除去書本而外，就是一副象棋，“Poker”也隨帶一付，但他不是爲了「沙蟹」或「羅宋」而備，這是他準備四個人打「橋牌」用的。在前綫上，記者曾有數晚和周氏連玩此戯，有時他會和我因分數而引起有趣的爭執。而周氏之所以躭於這兩種消遣，也必丙爲象棋之需要深沉的謀略，橋牌之需要精確的估計和判斷之故。至於醇酒婦人，則與周氏絲毫無緣。</p>
<p>記者與周氏在蘇北臨別之時，他送我一面截獲到的共匪的「鐮刀旗」做紀念。上面他還題了字，我淸楚地記得是下面幾句：「共匪在他們所謂的「解放區」內，遍種罌粟，懸掛蘇聯國旗，這不是毒害人民出賣國家民族的鐵證嗎』以私人授受之微，周將軍還於這些小處流露出他內心的正義感，所以一百軍這個部隊之能打勝仗，自決非出於偶然。</p>
<p>蘭封聚首</p>
<p>六月廿五日，記者隨邱淸泉兵團自豫東進迫開封，其時自開封突圍而出的前豫省主席劉茂恩，就寓於駐在蘭封的一百軍軍部裏。當天，邱淸泉將軍獲得消息，卽派車往接，記者也和第五軍軍長熊笑三氏去周將軍處迎接並慰問劉氏。這次又和周將軍見了一面，聚晤甚歡。</p>
<p>無限懷念</p>
<p>由一百軍而整八十三師，復由整八十三師而一百軍，記者和這個部隊中的每一位將士的感情太濃厚了。如今，周將軍不幸於督戰時負傷，飛滬就醫，記者身處砲火的邊緣，除以致意祝福周將軍早日康復而外，復對尙未悉現况如何的該軍其他將領以及全體將士，寄予莫大的懷念！</p>
<h3>活埋慘劇　麻瘋病人蓋棺慘叫</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿七日快訊〕湘道縣壽福鄉，麻瘋病流行，鄉人未省治療方法，迷信麻瘋患者死後卽傳染直系血親，是以將病人活埋，妄圖絕其病源。有名王眞者。不幸染有麻瘋症，家人恐遭傳染，乃商諸病人，實行活埋，病人爲求子孫安全，當接受活埋，於是家中殺鷄宰鴨，買肉沽酒，備宴供食，以誌死別。食後，王某忽念死之可怖，出奔深山，數日後又以飢餓難受歸來，再言願埋，家人又備宴餞別，食畢，將棺木置於門口，强迫入棺，王在無可奈何中，淚流滿襟，爬臥棺內，旋蓋棺加釘，王在棺內，猶頻呼「勿釘着了頭呀！」聞者莫不悚然！</p>
<h3>浦東南匯　實施三一減租</h3>
<p>大地主率先倡導租額僅往年半數</p>
<p>〔南匯廿五日訊〕浦東百餘方里土地，多數是可耕地，一百三十萬人口，多數是務農的，在這廣大農村裏，今年掀起了一個運動，便是「三一减租」，這是過去未曾有過的大事。若干大地主並親自要求縣長佈吿實行三一减祖，表示願意率先實行，浦東的大地主，最多的擁有田地一二千畝，由於他們覺悟了，覺得「耕者有其田」的趨勢很自然，這次南江縣首先實行了三一减租，（南江縣境約佔浦東一半面積），已經成立了何租評議委員會，日前開會，評定全縣租額爲：（一）沙坎地區，主產棉花雜糧，最高租額爲每畝豆四十斤。（二）團田區域及東至沙坎地區，主產棉稻雜糧，三一减租後，最高租額每畝白米三斗石升三合。（三）圖區區械，該區主產棉稻，最高租額，每畝爲白米四斗六升。</p>
<p>這樣低的租額，是空前未有的。約比了往年，低一半以上，往年圖田要收一石多米的租，現在祗有四斗多，對佃農實在是莫大的利益。各鄉鎭佃租評議委員會現已成立，該委員會係由地主三人，佃農三人，政府，參議會，農會各一人所組織，大家並一致主張，絕不允許觀念落後保守的地主把持。</p>
<p>除了南江首先實行外，奉賢也已按較低租額評定，其他各縣，聞也將一齊繼起發動减秬運動。</p>
<h3>湘田糧處大貪汚案　綠皮箱秘密　開庭審訊</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿七日快訊〕湘省田糧處前處長黃德安貪污案，經檢察官偵査中，曾有綠皮箱一口，內藏秘密文件，而此中秘密，法院因在偵査期中，未予公開，以致外間頗多揣測。所謂「綠皮箱秘密」，幾已喧傳一時。黃案於廿六日作首次公開審訊，自晨九時，迄晚九時許，始將被吿訊畢，其他關係人於廿七日繼續開庭，黃德安口供中，此一「綠皮箱秘密」已悉行吒露，案情當不難大白矣。</p>
<h3>錫提成平售糧食指揮所令澈查</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿六日訊〕首都衛戍總司令部無錫指揮听，頃奉總統府令，速卽澈查無錫縣就出口糧食，提取百分之二十，照市價六折結算平糶，是何根據，係於何日實施，截止文到之日，共計提成若干，再出口食糧徵百分之五，其辦理情形如何。縣府奉令後，以自限價政策硬性規定後，各地禁運阻運，莫不各自爲政，當時糧食部及上海民調會，在錫大量採購糧食，爲第安全計，是以由本縣平售委員會，對出運米隨，提取二成，充作平售，以資限止之辦法，雖明知於法無據，易招物議，而不明眞相者，認爲本邑有阻礙糧運之舉，聞悉甚表遺憾，現除據實呈復外，凝請示今後之妥善辦法。</p>

<h3>再論中國菜</h3>
<p>— 樂志</p>
<p>中國菜的歷史背景，大有可硏究者。古人講滋味，都以血肉品為主，不脫游收時代的習俗，其單調自不待言。飲食之藝術化，實在是道家之一種貢獻。本來道家的產物，是道地的中國文化的績髓，影饗民族生活方式最深，飲食其一也。秦漢以後所謂神仙採芝之說，就是飲食上一大進步，芝就是茵類，現在的木耳，磨菰，香草，以及各種覃都在其類，在滋味上增加變化，在衛生上裨益營養，古人精心硏究，不惜擺落塵事，以求人生生活的向上，其精神寳不可及。到了唐宋時代，佛敎深入中國文化形態之中，於是又在筍上下工失，這一千年之內，自蘇東坡提出玉版禪，黃山谷咒筍莫成竹之後，又開闢一番境界。現在我們所享受的中國美味，芝與筍仍是其中重要成分。從此可知中國菜之富有宗敎藝術，一樣代表道敎，一樣代表佛敎，反映高等智識階級之精神生活，冲和夷澹，超以象外，其味綿遠無窮。近代又加上了豆腐，豆腐的益處，大家都知道，不必再談的了，講到藝術上的意味，妙就妙在中和，其本身是了無滋味的，然而別樣菜的美味得之而愈彰，別樣菜的偏處得之而不爲害，這又是耐人玩索的一點奧妙。有些人頗不以素菜中豆腐製品太多爲然。誠然，這是流俗人的習氣，凡事用得太濫，作得太過，總是不好，素菜庖人過於求形式，又不等利用犬然材料，一味以豆腐麵筋爲法寳，實在是叫人怕吃素菜的一個大原因。這是本來應該改良的。</p>
<p>大概明朝中葉，海上交通發達以後，中國菜纔又起一大變化，這就是海味的佔上風了。從前通行的所謂八珍（其實也不過是想像之詞），大抵是山珍，而海錯極少提到。明末淸初，方纔知道燕窩魚翅海參，到了乾嘉以後，於是官塲宴會通以燕翅爲主菜，然而眞正大宴會還保留舊制，以燒烤爲主菜，上燒烤的時候，要奏樂，廚師親自跪獻。貴賓要賞錢的，這是古代風俗之餼羊。光緒年中，普通人仍以燕翹爲門面菜，並不去眞拿來考究滋味，尤其燕菜，是「尊而不親」的。到了末年，纔有人想出種種燒魚翅的新鮮方法。甚至於專喫魚翅一樣，別的不過作為餘波。這是海通以後中國文化的一種變動，然而須知魚翅的這樣吃法，已經成爲中國化了，魚翅的銷塲，也可以說是專在中國了。中國民族之能兼取衆長，化爲已有，這也是一證。</p>

<h3>失傳的文章</h3>
<p>— 細侯</p>
<p>小時塾師敎我們讀「古文觀止」，琅琅上口，但對文章內容却很隔膜。先生費勁講了半天，我們聰來並不起勁。可是「秋聲賦」裏的「垂頭而睡」的童子，「赤壁賦」裏「吹洞簫」的無名昔樂家（後人考出是道士楊世昌），却使我們喜歡，好像很可親近。還有，講到「滕王閣序」時，附帶提起的王勃如何夢見水神助風，如何趕赴九日閣宴，如何當筵不讓，如何警句壓倒嬌婿，這些穿挿，在我們孩子要比「落霞孤驚秋水長天」有趣得多。記得當時曾有一個想頭，以爲那位嬌婿的「宿搆」，也不妨拿出來大家欣賞欣賞。旣預備出風頭，總該不壞。可是終於失傳，這曾叫我暗暗爲吳子單不平。</p>
<p>還有老杜的「蘇端薛復筵簡薛華醉歌」裏有句云：「座中薛華善醉歌，歌辭自作風格老。近來海內爲長句，汝與山東李白好！」這位薛先生的「歌辭」，難道也受了社甫的壓倒而沒有傳唱人間嗎？每讀至此，不免令人戀戀。査他山云：「薛華歌詞至與太白並舉，此老（指杜）非輕譽者，惜其詩不傳。」恐怕還不止査先生一人作此感想哩。</p>
<p>古來失傳的文章，定不在少處。今人文集，多喜自編，隨時增訂，當可不慮有失矣。</p>

<h3>儒家的失敗</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>墨子說：「義者正也，必從上之正下，無從之之正上。」這雖是墨子的話，却頗足以代表我國往昔一般士大夫的悖謬的政治觀。其悖謬在於：上之正下，必有待於明主，然明主可遇而不可求，如果下必有待於明主來正之，則百年沒有明主，下便只好百年不正，千年沒有明主下便只好千年不正。此正是我國數千年來之所以始終不正也。何况考諸歷史，罕有上能正下之例。後代正前朝的例自然很多，可是及後代爲「上」，其不正如故，此蓋由於下不正上的緣故。</p>
<p>「必從上之正下」，說得通俗些，卽是鄉愚之冀求「眞命天子」。西洋民主國家的人民初不妄想「上之正下」，而上不得不正者，因下能正上，而且時時正之故也。</p>
<p>但思我們談了三四十年的歐美政治思想，事實上迄今未有若何成績，原因何在？時期尙短嗎？那末我們談了二三千年的儒家政治觀，亦始終不曾眞正見諸實行，這又是什麼綠故呢？</p>
<p>據我看，我國古時聖賢所講的道理是不錯的，不過他們所用的方法不對。所以儒家一開頭就吿失敗。孔孟都曾長期週遊列國，一忽兒見這個君，一忽說那個王，僕僕於諸侯間，席不暇暖，推行自己的主義不能說不努力，可是幾曾遊說出什麼頭緒來？實則此乃以諸侯爲遊說對象的必然結果。須知孔孟的主張與諸侯的立塲根本相反。叫諸侯放棄自己的旣得利益嗎？誰肯？</p>
<p>我國歷代先賢的錯就錯在「必從上之正下」這個謬見。因此上不願正，雖聖賢如孔孟也就一無辦法，加以失敗了還不知改變方針，自然只好退而著書立說去一了。當時他們二位如能認淸對象，效近世英人之所爲，天天揀公園熱閙處，站在肥皂箱上對衆演說自己的主義，把遊說諸侯的時間與精力用到這方面去，那末我國二三千年來的歷史必然不會如此寫。仔細思之，孔孟遊說諸侯救載的效力實不及今日電台還只播送了一星期的獨脚戯節目。筱快樂的關於加收學費的意見，不是已經引起了全市市民的注意了嗎？</p>
<p>近代我國提倡西洋政治思想的人們大半也犯了與孔孟同樣的錯誤。我們但須翻査一下過去關於這一類的文章，便可知道其內容雖是舶來，其筆調却仍不脫奏議口吻，滿懷希望「上之正下」，大都不像是寫給人民看的，因此人民也就不要看了。</p>
<p>筆者有感於此，老實不客氣把墨子的話改爲「必從下之正上，無從上之正下。」</p>
<h3>吝嗇的爵士</h3>
<p>— 强</p>
<p>英國哈維·艾烏斯爵士是帝文郡出名最吝嗇的富翁。有一次，他有一個姪女在他家中做客，她不識相的直到晚上九點鑛還藉着一盞小煤油燈的光亮縫衣服，這使爵士深爲不滿。</p>
<p>「把那盞燈熄掉！」擁有半百萬鎊家私的艾烏斯爵士終於忍耐不住了。</p>
<p>「可是，叔叔」，他的姪女抗辯說，「我明天需要穿道件衣服呀！而且，煤油又是我自己買的」。</p>
<p>「我知道，小姐」，爵士不肯放鬆的說：「可是這盞燈裏燒的燈芯是我買的呀！」</p>
<h3>東鱗西爪</h3>
<p>— 咸斯</p>
<p>英國伊頓公學的靑年學生們，一向以貴族化著名，學生們的「制帽」都是高頂大禮帽，儘管孩子們面上還稚氣未脫，但這頂「高帽子」却神氣十足。可是，近來因節約物資，大禮帽已不易買到，因之伊頓的學生們祗好從此取消了這頂「高帽子」。</p>
<p>瑞典的法律中有一條規定：凡國內任何公私機關行莊商店的職員，每年都可休息兩星期，假期中薪金照付。而新聞記者及醫師則准予休息一月，薪金照付。此項法律，已實施十年。</p>
<h3>關於積點配購證</h3>
<p>— 騁陸</p>
<p>去年我們公敎人員會領到過一次配購證，證內附有天地玄黃……等小方塊，每次扯一塊用，配給些許美軍剩餘物資，什麼罐頭糖果之類，日用品可說很少很少，罐頭等霉爛的居多。可是不久便停止了，而千字文莫說千字，恐怕只用了頗爲零丁的幾個字。</p>
<p>好了，現在又發了積點配購證，不久以前，我已去看過了，仍舊全是些不能當飯果腹的，奢侈的，或霉爛的罐頭，日用品仍是很少。可是每點只算一角錢，全月一百五十點，合十五金圓，又可自田選擇，自然不能說「不好」，大家也都還贊成。但是公敎人員剛才借到一倍半的薪津，便立刻每點也漲一倍半，要算二角半了。這還不算，又改爲由各機關全份　購，不但是全份的，並且配些什麼東西，得聽他賞！如此一來，大有强迫承購意味，比任何商店還凶了！</p>
<p>現在我們蒙政府開恩，薪金加到六倍了，當然每一積點，又要漲價六倍，那麼，每人每月須付出九十金圓了。這個數目，在我們小公務員看來，却是一筆巨款呢。我眞不敢預料，究竞還有多少人敢去問津？</p>
<p>當我服務的機關問我身份證號數時，（因爲造册之外，還須註明身份證號碼。）我已毅然放棄了，因爲我想省下這筆錢，多買一點米。如果全市同人們均如此辦法，當局倒可以將這些寳貝永遠珍藏起來，將來好當古董賣了——實實在在，現在豈非已經是古董了麼！</p>
<h3>皮胄荟</h3>
<p>二十二日，各處開始存款兌現，一方面使新劵回籠，一方面以事實說明新劵與金銀之眞的聯系，挽回信用，不失爲桑楡之補。天津首日僅兌出黃金一兩，北平亦不甚踴躍，原因是定期存款而至一年，在市民心目中·早已陌生，一年之限，在戰前正常時代，原是極普通之「定期」，但經濟變態時代，則到期所取，往往不抵存時十一乃至百一之用。故「定存」久無長期，不過一兩月放至一旬一星期，無至一年者。勝利之初。景象似乎好轉，乃因時局關係，經濟變態，有加無已，行莊存放。皆無正常之可能，其吸收游資招徠存款之告白，多以「期短利厚」相競賽，人人以爲存款不如存貨。長期存無殊拋棄，此乃歷史造成之習慣，固不能盡歸咎於「經改」。然積重之心情，旣驟難改變，故多人看得「存一兌一」無異於「以二兌一」，而平市價每黃物一兩，約金劵一千五六之謂，不到二數，則欲得黃貨而願求之私市者，乃不乏其人（白貨情形亦復如是）。蓋官價固比市價低，買者似乎合算，若幷存款看作買價之一相等部分，則又覺得比市價高了。</p>
<p>銀元本是多年全國行使的通貨，故與金鈔又有不同，自前淸以至民國事變前，市面交易，用銀元及銅元，印象極深。卽二十四年推行「法幣」，僅止不兌現而已，法幣票面上之所謂「圓」，固指銀元而言也。抗戰期內發行之關金，與現在之金圓劵。是金而非銀矣，然市間行使關金，仍按法幣計數，例如以五千關金賣買物件，口中不說五千而說「十萬」，所謂十萬，仍是法幣，仍指銀元也。金圓劵與法幣無聯屬稱謂矣，然「經改」之始，規定兩金圓抵一銀元，修正以後，則十金圓乃抵一銀元，金圓之値，倒比銀圓小，故銀元之身分益重，印象愈深，乃各方面捧塲，諸緣幅淡，覺非偶然。</p>

<h3>再論中國菜</h3>
<p>— 樂志</p>
<p>中國菜的歷史背景，大有可硏究者。古人講滋味，都以血肉品為主，不脫游收時代的習俗，其單調自不待言。飲食之藝術化，實在是道家之一種貢獻。本來道家的產物，是道地的中國文化的績髓，影饗民族生活方式最深，飲食其一也。秦漢以後所謂神仙採芝之說，就是飲食上一大進步，芝就是茵類，現在的木耳，磨菰，香草，以及各種覃都在其類，在滋味上增加變化，在衛生上裨益營養，古人精心硏究，不惜擺落塵事，以求人生生活的向上，其精神寳不可及。到了唐宋時代，佛敎深入中國文化形態之中，於是又在筍上下工失，這一千年之內，自蘇東坡提出玉版禪，黃山谷咒筍莫成竹之後，又開闢一番境界。現在我們所享受的中國美味，芝與筍仍是其中重要成分。從此可知中國菜之富有宗敎藝術，一樣代表道敎，一樣代表佛敎，反映高等智識階級之精神生活，冲和夷澹，超以象外，其味綿遠無窮。近代又加上了豆腐，豆腐的益處，大家都知道，不必再談的了，講到藝術上的意味，妙就妙在中和，其本身是了無滋味的，然而別樣菜的美味得之而愈彰，別樣菜的偏處得之而不爲害，這又是耐人玩索的一點奧妙。有些人頗不以素菜中豆腐製品太多爲然。誠然，這是流俗人的習氣，凡事用得太濫，作得太過，總是不好，素菜庖人過於求形式，又不等利用犬然材料，一味以豆腐麵筋爲法寳，實在是叫人怕吃素菜的一個大原因。這是本來應該改良的。</p>
<p>大概明朝中葉，海上交通發達以後，中國菜纔又起一大變化，這就是海味的佔上風了。從前通行的所謂八珍（其實也不過是想像之詞），大抵是山珍，而海錯極少提到。明末淸初，方纔知道燕窩魚翅海參，到了乾嘉以後，於是官塲宴會通以燕翅爲主菜，然而眞正大宴會還保留舊制，以燒烤爲主菜，上燒烤的時候，要奏樂，廚師親自跪獻。貴賓要賞錢的，這是古代風俗之餼羊。光緒年中，普通人仍以燕翹爲門面菜，並不去眞拿來考究滋味，尤其燕菜，是「尊而不親」的。到了末年，纔有人想出種種燒魚翅的新鮮方法。甚至於專喫魚翅一樣，別的不過作為餘波。這是海通以後中國文化的一種變動，然而須知魚翅的這樣吃法，已經成爲中國化了，魚翅的銷塲，也可以說是專在中國了。中國民族之能兼取衆長，化爲已有，這也是一證。</p>

<h3>失傳的文章</h3>

<p>小時塾師敎我們讀「古文觀止」，琅琅上口，但對文章內容却很隔膜。先生費勁講了半天，我們聰來並不起勁。可是「秋聲賦」裏的「垂頭而睡」的童子，「赤壁賦」裏「吹洞簫」的無名昔樂家（後人考出是道士楊世昌），却使我們喜歡，好像很可親近。還有，講到「滕王閣序」時，附帶提起的王勃如何夢見水神助風，如何趕赴九日閣宴，如何當筵不讓，如何警句壓倒嬌婿，這些穿挿，在我們孩子要比「落霞孤驚秋水長天」有趣得多。記得當時曾有一個想頭，以爲那位嬌婿的「宿搆」，也不妨拿出來大家欣賞欣賞。旣預備出風頭，總該不壞。可是終於失傳，這曾叫我暗暗爲吳子單不平。</p>
<p>還有老杜的「蘇端薛復筵簡薛華醉歌」裏有句云：「座中薛華善醉歌，歌辭自作風格老。近來海內爲長句，汝與山東李白好！」這位薛先生的「歌辭」，難道也受了社甫的壓倒而沒有傳唱人間嗎？每讀至此，不免令人戀戀。査他山云：「薛華歌詞至與太白並舉，此老（指杜）非輕譽者，惜其詩不傳。」恐怕還不止査先生一人作此感想哩。</p>

<h3>儒家的失敗</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>墨子說：「義者正也，必從上之正下，無從之之正上。」這雖是墨子的話，却頗足以代表我國往昔一般士大夫的悖謬的政治觀。其悖謬在於：上之正下，必有待於明主，然明主可遇而不可求，如果下必有待於明主來正之，則百年沒有明主，下便只好百年不正，千年沒有明主下便只好千年不正。此正是我國數千年來之所以始終不正也。何况考諸歷史，罕有上能正下之例。後代正前朝的例自然很多，可是及後代爲「上」，其不正如故，此蓋由於下不正上的緣故。</p>
<p>「必從上之正下」，說得通俗些，卽是鄉愚之冀求「眞命天子」。西洋民主國家的人民初不妄想「上之正下」，而上不得不正者，因下能正上，而且時時正之故也。</p>
<p>但思我們談了三四十年的歐美政治思想，事實上迄今未有若何成績，原因何在？時期尙短嗎？那末我們談了二三千年的儒家政治觀，亦始終不曾眞正見諸實行，這又是什麼綠故呢？</p>

<p>去年我們公敎人員會領到過一次配購證，證內附有天地玄黃……等小方塊，每次扯一塊用，配給些許美軍剩餘物資，什麼罐頭糖果之類，日用品可說很少很少，罐頭等霉爛的居多。可是不久便停止了，而千字文莫說千字，恐怕只用了頗爲零丁的幾個字。</p>
<p>好了，現在又發了積點配購證，不久以前，我已去看過了，仍舊全是些不能當飯果腹的，奢侈的，或霉爛的罐頭，日用品仍是很少。可是每點只算一角錢，全月一百五十點，合十五金圓，又可自田選擇，自然不能說「不好」，大家也都還贊成。但是公敎人員剛才借到一倍半的薪津，便立刻每點也漲一倍半，要算二角半了。這還不算，又改爲由各機關全份　購，不但是全份的，並且配些什麼東西，得聽他賞！如此一來，大有强迫承購意味，比任何商店還凶了！</p>
<p>現在我們蒙政府開恩，薪金加到六倍了，當然每一積點，又要漲價六倍，那麼，每人每月須付出九十金圓了。這個數目，在我們小公務員看來，却是一筆巨款呢。我眞不敢預料，究竞還有多少人敢去問津？</p>
<p>當我服務的機關問我身份證號數時，（因爲造册之外，還須註明身份證號碼。）我已毅然放棄了，因爲我想省下這筆錢，多買一點米。如果全市同人們均如此辦法，當局倒可以將這些寳貝永遠珍藏起來，將來好當古董賣了——實實在在，現在豈非已經是古董了麼！</p>
<h3>皮胄荟</h3>
<p>二十二日，各處開始存款兌現，一方面使新劵回籠，一方面以事實說明新劵與金銀之眞的聯系，挽回信用，不失爲桑楡之補。天津首日僅兌出黃金一兩，北平亦不甚踴躍，原因是定期存款而至一年，在市民心目中·早已陌生，一年之限，在戰前正常時代，原是極普通之「定期」，但經濟變態時代，則到期所取，往往不抵存時十一乃至百一之用。故「定存」久無長期，不過一兩月放至一旬一星期，無至一年者。勝利之初。景象似乎好轉，乃因時局關係，經濟變態，有加無已，行莊存放。皆無正常之可能，其吸收游資招徠存款之告白，多以「期短利厚」相競賽，人人以爲存款不如存貨。長期存無殊拋棄，此乃歷史造成之習慣，固不能盡歸咎於「經改」。然積重之心情，旣驟難改變，故多人看得「存一兌一」無異於「以二兌一」，而平市價每黃物一兩，約金劵一千五六之謂，不到二數，則欲得黃貨而願求之私市者，乃不乏其人（白貨情形亦復如是）。蓋官價固比市價低，買者似乎合算，若幷存款看作買價之一相等部分，則又覺得比市價高了。</p>
<p>銀元本是多年全國行使的通貨，故與金鈔又有不同，自前淸以至民國事變前，市面交易，用銀元及銅元，印象極深。卽二十四年推行「法幣」，僅止不兌現而已，法幣票面上之所謂「圓」，固指銀元而言也。抗戰期內發行之關金，與現在之金圓劵。是金而非銀矣，然市間行使關金，仍按法幣計數，例如以五千關金賣買物件，口中不說五千而說「十萬」，所謂十萬，仍是法幣，仍指銀元也。金圓劵與法幣無聯屬稱謂矣，然「經改」之始，規定兩金圓抵一銀元，修正以後，則十金圓乃抵一銀元，金圓之値，倒比銀圓小，故銀元之身分益重，印象愈深，乃各方面捧塲，諸緣幅淡，覺非偶然。</p>

<h3>The Battle of Bangbu and Su County: Communist Troops Suffer Initial Setback; National Army Deploys Sacks Array, Communist Supplies are Challenged and will be Forced to Retreat North</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bangbu, 29th] Today is the second day since the start of the Battle of Bangbu and Su County. Communist troops suffered a major blow from the National Army in their initial offensive on the Hugou and Guzhen line and are now gathering their main forces to prepare for the next action. In order to implement its established strategy, the National Army has voluntarily abandoned Guzhen. The 3rd Army Corps of Huang Wei, Li Yannian, and Liu Ruming have deployed a sacks array in the Dangtu area of Bangbu. Some Communist troops crossed the Huai River today and engaged in fierce battles with the National Army on the east, west, and north sides of Xinqiao.

The air force also flew in to assist, inflicting serious blows on the Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bangbu, 29th] Since Gu Zhutong came to Bangbu to make deployments, and Liu Zhi arrived here yesterday to take command, the National Army seems to have a major strategy in the Battle of Bangbu and Su County, that is, to attract the main force of the Communist troops to the area south of the Huai River, and then encircle and annihilate them. The current battle situation is developing in this direction. [Our Correspondent in Bangbu, 9th] According to an official close to Liu Zhi, Liu arrived at Zha yesterday afternoon, and yesterday evening and this morning, he separately met with various generals in this area, giving instructions or holding discussions. In the talks, Liu expressed extreme optimism about the current battle situation.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 29th] Zeng Xubai, Deputy Director of the Information Bureau, firmly denied on the 29th that the government had ordered the National Army to abandon Xuzhou and reinforce Bangbu to prevent the Communist troops from encroaching on the Yangtze River. He denounced the rumor as "completely unfounded and completely untrue." The cause of this rumor is probably that the government's two armies are going south, attached to the back of Su County, and joining the Battle of Bu and Su County.</p>

<h3>Shift of Focus in Battle for Suburbs of Taiyuan; Bloody Battles in Northwest of the City; Communist Assault at Guankou Repulsed, Momentum Checked</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th] Fierce battles have broken out in the northwest area of Taiyuan. After suffering heavy losses in the Dongshan area and the northern and southern outer Guankou areas over the past two months, the invading Communist troops shifted their target. On the evening of the 27th, they ordered more than 2,000 men from their Seventh Column to launch a fierce attack on Guankou, more than 60 li northwest of the city, and the area near Sucun Baiban to the east. The defending troops and local militia engaged in a fierce battle with the Communist troops. After a day and night of bloody fighting, the Communist troops suffered heavy casualties. The morale of the National Army was high, and they fought more and more bravely. By the evening of the 28th, the Communist troops' offensive had been checked under the suppression of our intense firepower. In addition, more than 1,000 local Communist armed forces, who had just been recovered by the National Army in the Shiqianfeng north-south area, more than 40 li west of Taiyuan, sneaked back on the 28th, attempting to make trouble. The National Army is closely monitoring them.</p>
<p>(Another cable) The focus of the battle for the suburbs of Taiyuan has shifted to the northwest of the city and the mountainous areas to the west.

The Communist troops attacking Guankou, more than 60 li northwest of the city, had their offensive checked after being severely attacked by the defending troops. However, in order to concentrate its forces, the National Army has voluntarily moved to advantageous positions, preparing to inflict even more severe blows on the Communist troops. The 11th Brigade of the Communist troops, which was hit hard at Matoushui (about 40 li northwest of the city), and the New Fourth Brigade of the Communist troops in the area south of Yan, southwest of the city, sneaked to the area west of Huaqitou (west of Xisiming Village), about 30 li west of the city, on the 28th and came into contact with our outpost troops.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang May Arrive in Washington Tomorrow; To Promote a New Movement to Aid China; Truman and Marshall Still Reviewing the Issue of Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] After Madame Chiang arrives in the United States, she is expected to promote a new movement to urge the United States to increase aid to China. Although the content of the new movement is unknown, most experts believe that Madame Chiang will request full U.S. aid based on the following two just reasons: (1) The Chinese government is not only suppressing internal unrest, but also expanding its resistance to communism on behalf of the United States and all other democratic countries. (2) It is the duty of the United States to provide the Chinese government with the assistance it needs to save the situation. As far as the United States is concerned, this is a rare opportunity. In the beginning, the Yalta Agreement between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union stipulated that the Soviet Union would obtain certain railway, port, and base rights in the nine eastern provinces of China, which was the reason why the Chinese Communists later won in the Northeast. For this point alone, the United States should also assist China to compensate for its mistakes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The success of Madame Chiang's visit to the United States seems to depend on the reaction of the public and Congress, rather than any rapid change in the U.S. government's coolness toward the National Government. Officials admit that the hope for the success of Madame Chiang's trip lies in the impact she has on Congress and public opinion. Madame Chiang may arrive here on December 1 and is expected to be invited to attend committees or joint meetings of Congress to state China's needs. Legislative steps cannot be taken quickly now, but Madame Chiang's views can influence the actions of the new Congress in January. While waiting for more news from Nanjing about Madame Chiang's trip, there are currently no plans to formally host Madame Chiang at the White House or the State Department. According to Chinese officials, they expect Madame Chiang's trip to be "very short" because of the serious situation in China. Madame Chiang is expected to urge the United States to issue a clear statement supporting the Kuomintang's policies, and state that U.S. officials are more actively involved in strategic matters, and immediately increase the plan to aid China with military and economic assistance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] The hope that Madame Chiang will personally appeal to the U.S. Congress for more aid to China greatly increased on the 29th. Senator Smith, the Republican chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Aid Oversight, said that he would carefully consider the proposal to invite Madame Chiang to testify on Friday, which was proposed by Democratic Congressman Bloom. Bloom will soon succeed as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the new Congress, which is very important. Bloom also directly criticized the U.S. government for its delay in large-scale support of President Chiang's anti-communist war. But he said that Congress was tired of the talk about the corruption of the National Government. "If China needs more military equipment, we should handle it with appropriate people. We have to do something." Weller, a key Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also urged Congress to hear Madame Chiang's statement. He advocated that a joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives be held, and Madame Chiang would attend to testify.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] The issue of the United States increasing aid to China is still under careful review by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, and no final decision has been made. Congressman Eaton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters bluntly: "I don't know how we can continue to aid China and make it effective immediately, because the Chinese problem is an international dispute, and no sage can predict its future." This statement can represent the official view of the United States, but it does not mean that there is a lack of sincerity in aiding China. What Americans are worried about is that full-scale aid to China will make the U.S. economy unbearable, so it must be carefully considered. Washington is also aware of Nanjing's accusation that Marshall has failed to provide China with adequate assistance. However, from the overall trend, the United States will inevitably give China reasonable assistance, while encouraging China to find its own way out.</p>
<h3>New York Daily Mirror Urges Aid to China to Resist Communism</h3>
<p>Otherwise, There Will Be War on American Soil</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] An editorial in the Hearst-owned New York Daily Mirror today stated that the United States' top priority is to prevent the Soviet Union from conquering China through the hands of the Chinese Communists. If this cannot be done successfully, there will sooner or later be war on American soil. If China fails, the Soviet Union can use the Chinese people as cannon fodder to conquer all of Asia. As a result, the United States will be completely cut off from other Pacific countries, and Hawaii will be extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3>Bullitt Passes Through Xiamen and Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Having Inspected the Seaport at Gulangyu</p>

<h3>Taixing Kou'an Town Once Fell to Communist Troops; Army and Navy Counterattack and Recapture; Scattered Communist Troops in the Triangle Area at the Junction of Zhenjiang and Danyang Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 29th] Military sources: Liang Lingguang's three regiments of the Communist Army in central Jiangsu attacked Kou'an again on the 28th. The National Army was outnumbered and briefly lost the area. Then, the National Army in Taixing rushed to the rescue overnight, and the Jiangfang Navy rushed to bombard it at the same time. Kou'an was recaptured within 20 hours. The Communist troops suffered more than half of their casualties and have fled towards Sixiangkou and along the Yangtze River in Jiangdu.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixing, 28th] (Delayed) The Communist Jingtai Independent Regiment and the Special Service Regiment of the Military Sub-district, gathered a crowd of 2,000, attacked the strongholds of Kou'an and Longwukou at about 10:00 PM on the 27th. Although the garrison troops, the county security team, and a National Army company were small in number, they were able to respond calmly. The fighting was fierce all night, and the artillery fire was intense. Although the warships in the estuary fired to assist in the battle, the Communist troops stubbornly refused to retreat. Qian, the magistrate of Taixing, personally led the local militia and cooperated with Yue's regiment of the National Army to advance towards Kou'an in two directions at dawn on the 28th to rush to the rescue.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 29th] The Guishantou, Daluzhen, Dagangzhen, Luyingjiaqiao, and Shiqiaotou areas in the triangle area at the junction of Zhenjiang, Danyang, and Yangzhou have been constantly searched, suppressed, and attacked by the traffic police brigade in the past week. The remaining Communist troops have fled at the sight of the wind. The area is gradually entering a state of tranquility. Businesses are seeing prosperity again, and the people are living and working in peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] The Ministry of the Navy today dispatched six warships to patrol the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and inspect ships to prevent Communist troops from sneaking in.</p>
<h3>The Campaign for the Successor President of the Legislative Yuan; Those Aspiring for the Position Begin Activities; Fu Sinian Declares He Does Not Intend to Participate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] After Sun Ke decided to head the Executive Yuan, the question of who will succeed him as President of the Legislative Yuan has attracted the attention of many people. All parties are also deeply interested in the frequent contacts between various societies in the Legislative Yuan in recent days, because according to the Constitution, the candidate for President of the Legislative Yuan should be produced by the mutual election of the legislators. When the Legislative Yuan first met this spring, Sun Ke was elected President with unmatched advantages, and the competition for Vice President was also extremely fierce. Now, the position of President is vacant due to Sun Ke's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan. Although the date of the new President's mutual election still needs to wait until Sun Ke formally submits his resignation before it can be determined, those who aspire to the position have begun their campaign activities. Fu Sinian, who was supported by many northern legislators this spring and passively participated in the election for Vice President, becoming Chen Lifu's formidable rival, unexpectedly declared that under no circumstances does he intend to participate in the election. Huang Shaohong, who was eager to try at that time and almost defeated Chen Lifu, is also silent. Therefore, the main candidates are actually Chen Lifu and Wu Tiecheng. Chen is the current Vice President. The Reform Club he leads held a meeting on the 29th to discuss the election issue. Wu also has great potential in the Legislative Yuan. The Democratic Freedom Society organized by his supporters also held a meeting on the 28th to make preparations for the election. According to the situation a few days ago, Wu will be supported by various legislator groups of the Kuomintang's young and middle-aged members, such as the New Politics Club and the 14 Roundtable Conference. If so, his strength can compete with Chen's Reform Club. Therefore, before the new President's mutual election, the focus of the competition between the two sides will be the striving for non-aligned members. The reporter learned that many non-aligned legislators, who were still a mess in the first session, have automatically formed a very democratic organization in the second session. This organization is called the Zhengyou Society, and it aims to be objective, non-aligned, democratic, and excellent. Every Wednesday, more than a dozen committee members invite a tea party to exchange opinions extensively. It has been more than two months since then. Their efforts have increased the efficiency of the Legislative Yuan's deliberations in the Procedural Committee and the General Assembly. On the 29th, some members of the society, such as Song Shuqiao, Hong Ruizhao, and Lou Tongsun, publicly expressed their views on the new President's mutual election. They believe that: "The Kuomintang is the majority party in the Legislative Yuan. At a time when the enemy is approaching and the Sun Cabinet is yet to be formed, the strong unity of the various factions of the majority party is not enough to cope with the urgent crisis. The Legislative Yuan is the political center in the Constitution and should not be hurt by the President's election, so that the members of the majority party hurt their feelings and increase the split, repeating the mistakes of the past elections of the Vice President and Vice President. Therefore, it is unanimously advocated that the Kuomintang Central Committee nominate candidates, so as to avoid party comrades competing and increasing disputes, which will affect the suppression of the chaos." Judging from the current situation, the one hundred or so votes held by the Zhengyou Society have made them have a pivotal role in the competition for the new President. The reporter asked a member of the society on the 29th, if the Kuomintang Central Committee does not intend to nominate candidates, who will they support? The member replied that this question will be discussed at the society's tea party on the 1st, and that his personal opinion is that the Zhengyou Society has no preconceived notions about this choice. Both the Reform Club and the Democratic Freedom Society are trying to win the votes of the Zhengyou Society, but as of the 29th, the former seems to have a slight advantage.</p>
<h3>The Economic Cooperation Committee to Hold its First Meeting Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Economic Cooperation Committee will hold its first meeting within days. Lin Weiying has been internally designated as the Secretary-General of the Committee. Lin has returned from the United States and arrived in Hong Kong, and is waiting for a flight to Nanjing. According to the organizational law, the Director of the Committee is concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan or designated by the President of the Executive Yuan. It has now been decided that Sun, the President of the Executive Yuan, will concurrently hold the post. In addition to those stipulated in the organizational law, the newly appointed Deputy Minister of Finance Shen Yuanding (officially announced on the 29th) is also one of the committee members and is responsible for important responsibilities. Shen is scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants to Purchase and Import Foreign Grain; All to be Exempt from Import Tax; Production Situation of Flour Mills in Shanghai Improves</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] According to the Grain News Agency: The war zone continues to expand, and the food shortage in cities is becoming increasingly serious. In order to avoid food shortages, the grain administration authorities are formulating measures to import foreign grain and encourage grain merchants to purchase grain. It is reported that in the above-mentioned measures, the foreign grain imported by grain merchants will be exempt from import tax, and it is planned to assist grain merchants in solving the difficulties of foreign exchange and transportation.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] According to the Grain News Agency: Chuan Guangze, a helpmate of the Regulatory Department of the Ministry of Food, went to Shanghai a few days ago to investigate the recent production situation of various flour mills. He returned to Nanjing on the 29th. According to him, the production situation of various mills in Shanghai has improved since the price limit was lifted. In November, the total output of finished products from various mills was more than 1.3 million bags, and it is estimated that in December it will be between 1.3 million and 1.5 million bags. The inventory of wheat is also abundant. According to the investigation, there are currently 3.5 million dan of wheat in stock, but manufacturers have difficulty in capital turnover. They hope that the government will provide reasonable assistance. It is best to entrust national banks and bureaus to adopt a ordering method of paying first and then picking up the goods, and purchase all the products at a uniform price.</p>
<h3>Chen Liang, Deputy Minister of Food, Goes to Beiping and Tianjin to Discuss the Purchase of Grain in the Haihe Area</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] In order to strengthen control over the grain supply in North China, the Ministry of Food has specially dispatched Chen Liang, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry, to go to Beiping and Tianjin immediately to discuss the issue of accelerating the purchase of grain in the Haihe area. In the future, the grain supply in North China can be made more abundant, ensuring that there will be no shortage.</p>
<h3>Howard Newspaper Comments: Sun Fo Forms Cabinet with Friendly Attitude; America Cannot Hesitate; Zhang Junmai Claims Democratic Socialist Party Will Not Participate in Politics; Youth Party Legislators Hope to Unleash People's Power to Rebuild Monetary Confidence</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 29th] An editorial in a Howard newspaper on the 29th praised Sun Fo for taking on the Executive Yuan. It also stated that whether the traditional friendship between China and the United States can be maintained, "depends on us, therefore we must not hesitate." The editorial stated that Sun's formation of a cabinet is a gesture of friendship toward the United States, as Sun studied in the United States and has a Western mindset and is a stalwart of the liberal faction.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, in a conversation with visiting reporters yesterday, stated that in this cabinet reshuffle, the Democratic Socialist Party has decided to remain in the opposition to contribute to the country. Therefore, it is not considering participating in politics. He hopes that the various factions within the Kuomintang will unite after Premier Sun forms his cabinet. While political reform is necessary at this stage, diplomacy still depends mainly on ourselves. If we strengthen ourselves, foreign aid will naturally come. In terms of domestic affairs, he hopes that all measures will respect the system and the law, and new people should be employed as much as possible to bring a new atmosphere to politics. Personnel should be employed based on meritocracy. Provincial chairmen should be given real power, and people in various departments under the central government should also be given considerable authority, so that they do not have to ask the president for decisions on everything. At the same time, while all military measures are important, it is important to pay attention to winning people's hearts.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] News from the Legislative Yuan's press office: Youth Party legislators Li Gongquan, Su Ruzhan, Shi Yiren, Dong Wei, and others recently expressed their opinions on Sun Fo's succession as Premier of the Executive Yuan, stating: Premier Weng's resignation has been almost a month, and it was not until the 26th that the President proposed Sun Zhesheng as his successor. The Legislative Yuan immediately passed the motion with a large majority. Our opinion on Mr. Sun's succession as Premier is: (1) Mr. Sun has always advocated democratic politics, and since the War of Resistance, he has made great contributions to promoting our country's democratic constitutionalism. This time, he is taking office as the second cabinet after the implementation of the constitution, and we hope that Mr. Sun will establish more constitutional norms. (2) After Premier Weng submitted his resignation, there was a so-called "wartime cabinet" rumor. This system is fine for strengthening administration and combat power, but we hope that it will not affect the powers and responsibilities of the Legislative Yuan and become a measure that violates constitutionalism. We believe that Mr. Sun will pay attention to this after becoming Premier of the Executive Yuan. (3) In the past, government measures often guarded against the people, making people's power weaker and weaker. For example, the people's self-defense forces in various provinces now are much worse than in the past. We hope that after Mr. Sun takes office, he will let go and cultivate people's power and unleash people's power. As long as the government is confident that what it does is indeed for the people, the people will naturally support the government. (4) The government has lost faith with the people too many times in the past. The most obvious examples are the past gold savings and this currency reform. Now, the revised method of issuing gold yuan notes and exchanging gold and silver is to rebuild monetary confidence. We hope that after Mr. Sun forms his cabinet, he can implement it earnestly to "show great faith and demonstrate great fairness." (5) Finally, we see that Mr. Sun is staying in Shanghai, naturally to prepare for forming the cabinet, but at this urgent moment, it seems that there should not be much delay. We hope that he will return to Nanjing immediately to establish a new cabinet to comfort the hopes of the people throughout the country.</p>
<p>[Our City News] Premier Sun entered the Sino-Belgian Hospital yesterday morning due to his unhealed foot ailment and underwent surgery. The doctors treating Mr. Sun were Wu Huanxing and Lin Baihui. It is reported that the surgery went very well and he will be discharged from the hospital within days. However, during his hospitalization, he will follow the doctor's orders and rest, so he will not be receiving guests.</p>

<h3>The International United Front for Anti-Communism in the Far East – Can Start from Shanghai –</h3>
<p>The overall situation of China's anti-communist war has evolved to this point. It is necessary to quickly conclude an international united front for anti-communism in the Far East, referring to the precedent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for anti-communism, and Shanghai is the best place to start.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek flew to the United States the night before last to appeal for stronger aid to China, and is expected to arrive in Washington tomorrow. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall are still reviewing how to effectively aid China, and no final decision has been made. According to a New York dispatch, looking at the general trend, the United States will definitely provide China with reasonable assistance, and at the same time, it will definitely encourage the Chinese people to help themselves. From this, we can know that our seeking help from the United States must be based on our efforts to help ourselves. If the Chinese people can help themselves, we firmly believe that friendly countries - especially the United States - will be able to help us. If the Chinese people can help themselves, then all countries that love democracy, peace, and freedom will be willing to help us as much as they can. In this way, the international united front for anti-communism in the Far East can be expected to be successfully concluded in China. Because, if democratic countries do not want to prevent the spread of communism, they cannot simply allow the Communist Party to rule China and then control the entire Asia.</p>
<p>In the Far Eastern anti-communist united front, China is the vanguard, the United States should be the main force behind it, and if England, France, Holland, Australia, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, Burma, Siam, Korea, - and even Japan after awakening, all those who do not want the people of the Far East to fall into the hands of the Communist Party and lose the right to a free life, should gradually unite to complete a strong defense line to counter the red iron curtain. It must be known that the Communist Parties of various countries under the command of the Communist International are tools for its world revolution, and originally belong to one body without national boundaries; if democratic countries still cannot understand and help each other to extinguish this gradually raging fire, it will eventually burn themselves!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the editorial of the Ta Mei Evening News advocated that: when Americans are considering a decision on China, we should obtain a firm United Front in China. This is of course a statement from the perspective of American journalists, thinking for the United States, but it is indeed necessary and can be said to truly resonate with my heart. As the Ta Mei Evening News said, while the British are advocating that the United States continue to provide China with strong and effective assistance, some British people are claiming that they will stay in Shanghai and "continue business," regardless of who the land falls into. Then Americans are like chivalrous people saving others, taking chestnuts out of the fire for others, and if they fail, they will suffer themselves, while others can benefit from "neutrality." Today, if we are still only considering the small calculation of possibly trading with the Communist Party, and ignoring the great disaster of the entire world turning red and changing the free way of life of mankind, no matter what country, it will be too late to regret it in the future! Are the British people not clear about the Communist Party's activities in Malaya? Taking China as an example, the treasures of the Northeast are occupied by the Communist Party and will inevitably be given to the Soviet Union, while the interests of British merchants in the Yangtze River basin and South China may be greater than those of American merchants. Can they dream of sharing a piece of the pie under the control of the Communist totalitarian regime? If the British are discerning, they will definitely not think this way. It is true that the British people must first take care of Europe, but in the Far East, if they want to maintain free trade, they cannot cooperate with China and the United States in time to form an anti-communist united front. Indeed, the United States is uniquely wealthy and can take on more important tasks, but logically speaking, how can Britain stay out of it?</p>
<p>As for China, the red fire has now burned to our home, and timely self-rescue is the responsibility that every citizen should have. As far as the government is concerned, it must not casually plan to retreat at this time. It must be known that "I can go, and the enemy can also go. Therefore, we must stand firm, deeply blame ourselves, and then call out loudly, calling on the people of the whole country, regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of north, south, east, or west, regardless of whether they are in front of or behind the enemy, as long as they are people who do not want to be red slaves, they should rise up spontaneously, strongly oppose communism, and not coexist with the brutal bandits. We must swear to fight until the Communist bandits put down their murderous weapons. As far as the people are concerned, first of all, we must recognize that this anti-communist war is a war between a free way of life and a slave way of life, and a watershed between independence and extinction. In the areas controlled by the Communist Party, not only is everything communist, but also wives are shared. The refugees from the bandit areas can all speak of this with certainty. If this continues, not only will the country be destroyed, but the race will also be wiped out. Anyone who has a sense of Chinese history and has been nurtured by traditional culture should be aware that the red disaster is far worse than floods and beasts! If everyone only takes escape as their ability, thinking that they may be able to preserve their lives, they do not know that when the earth sinks, there is no place for individuals to stand. Only by striving for self-help, uniting together, contributing money and effort, and suppressing bandits and quelling chaos, can we save ourselves, save the country, save humanity, and save the world. If there are still people who think that when the Communist Party comes in the future, we can still trade freely, we can still talk freely, we can still freely own property, and freely maintain our lives, that is simply an incredible dream - today we are asking for help from international friends, looking up to see how the United States is doing, how the United Kingdom is doing, but looking back at ourselves, we are doing nothing at all, and not even pulling out a hair to help. What is this? Therefore, the formation of an international anti-communist united front in the Far East - in China - should start with the efforts of our Chinese people themselves.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international city with more than a hundred years of history, and China's largest trading port. The concession system and unequal treaties are something that Chinese and foreign people alike do not want to see revived. However, among the millions of residents in Shanghai, there are Chinese and there are also expatriates from various countries, especially from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The Chinese people in Shanghai should not move casually, and the expatriates do not need to retreat arbitrarily. There is manpower, there are resources, and there is land, sea, and air transportation. As long as everyone unites to form an international anti-communist united front in Shanghai first, we do not believe that there is no local self-defense capability, and we do not believe that there is no chance to save China and save the world. It is up to people to make things happen, and heaven helps those who help themselves. May all our compatriots in the city and the country who love the country and love freedom, as well as friendly countries that uphold democracy and freedom, rise up together to plan this!</p>
<h3>The People on the Xuzhou-Bengbu Frontline are Extremely Calm and Firm; The Morale of the National Army Soldiers is also Unprecedented</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 29th] Although the distance between the war and Bengbu seems to be closer, the people's morale is still very stable. Heroic soldiers come and go on the Huai River railway bridge, and the citizens watch with excitement. Entertainment venues are also open as usual. Except for the fact that formal transactions in the market are scarce, the price of Yuan Datou silver dollars and gold has risen, and a few schools have begun to suspend classes in disguise, giving people a slight stimulus, this place hardly knows that a great battle with decisive significance for the country and the nation has begun more than sixty li away. However, the military authorities are now actively carrying out the work of eliminating traitors and preventing espionage.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Press Corps</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City] The press corps of this city set off on the 25th for the Xuzhou front to interview. After four days, it returned to Shanghai via Nanjing on the 29th. The press corps felt deeply that "seeing is believing." The firmness and calmness of the people on the front line are in stark contrast to the rumors and gossip in the rear. In the historical Xuzhou campaign, the National Army has completed its initial victory. The second major battle is now taking shape in the area east and west of Suxian on the Jinpu South Line, and the military center of gravity has also shifted south from Xuzhou. Liu Zhi, Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, is now stationed in Bengbu to command. Liu pointed out when he met with reporters in Xuzhou that the Xuzhou campaign is actually the decisive battle of the entire Central China battlefield, and its significance is extraordinary. According to reports, the total number of casualties of the bandits in the first stage of the battle was more than 150,000, and the National Army suffered about 90,000 casualties. In the middle of this month, Xuzhou was quite tight at one point. At that time, General Du Yuming, who was in command, quickly moved the Qiu Qingquan Corps from the western front to the east to meet the Huang Baitao Corps, reversing the battle situation. This was a major strategic success. General Du, who has experienced many battles, has great confidence in the current second stage of the war. He said that the Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng bandit troops now gathered on the east and west sides of Suxian will definitely run into another big nail. He said in an optimistic tone: The southern section of Jinpu will definitely be opened up in the short term. He also said: The achievements of the joint operations of the army, navy and air force and tanks this time broke the record since the bandit suppression war. Du reviewed the bandit situation and believed that we should concentrate all manpower and material resources on the front, thoroughly implement total war to deal with the bandit's total war, which is the most urgent task at present. The reporters spent two days inspecting the eastern and southern battlefields, meeting with Qiu Qingquan and Sun Yuanliang, commanders of the two corps, and visiting the National Army's operations in the front-line trenches, witnessing the National Army's capture of bandit positions as if they were watching a war film in a theater. The National Army is well-equipped and has strong morale, which is not comparable to the bandit troops who were coerced into fighting. Zhang Daofan and Fang Zhi, the heads of the condolence delegations from Nanjing and Shanghai, led their members to the front line to comfort the soldiers, creating unprecedented achievements in the condolence work. The officers and soldiers were inspired and achieved great results.</p>
<p>What Foreign Reporters Saw</p>
<p>[United Press International, Xuzhou, 29th] The morale of the Central China National Army is unprecedented. The reporter flew to Nanjing today on the same plane with many wounded soldiers. I saw that these people had full faces and their clothes were very warm. The seriously wounded groaned without complaint, because they hoped that the pain would be reduced after arriving at the rear hospital, while the lightly wounded talked and laughed freely. A short Guangdong soldier, with his right shoulder wrapped in bandages, sat next to the reporter, looked up at me and smiled, stretched out his fist, and raised his thumb, saying "Very good"! This hillbilly had seen airplanes soaring in the sky, but had never tasted the thrill of sitting in an airplane. He was surprised and grateful for the opportunity to take off.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Xuzhou, 29th] Airplanes from various private Chinese airlines are stepping up the transportation of wounded soldiers from the front line to hospitals in the Nanjing-Shanghai area for treatment. Yesterday, 2,700 wounded soldiers were transported. China National Aviation Corporation has eleven airplanes, flying thirty-three flights a day. Central Air Transport Corporation has eight airplanes, flying twenty-four flights a day. The number of flights for the Civil Aviation Brigade is the same as that of Central. Roosevelt, the deputy manager of CNAC, said: The company is prepared to fly one hundred flights a day, and can increase the number if necessary. Airplanes come and go like weaving at the Xuzhou Southeast Airport. In addition to civil aviation airplanes, there are also B-24, B-25 and B-31 bombers departing to carry out combat missions.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The first and second condolence delegations of the National Condolence Association set off in two groups today to condole the troops. The first group, led by Zhang Daofan, went to the front line south of Xuzhou to comfort all the soldiers of the Sun Yuanliang Corps. The second group, led by Fang Zhi, condoled the Li Mi Corps, the Xuzhou city defense troops, and the air force here. The second group went to the airfield at 10:00 a.m. to condole the air force, visited the Li Mi Corps headquarters and the First Tank Regiment at 11:00 a.m., and went to Feng Zhian's office in Xuzhou at noon to condole.</p>

<h3>Memorial Week of the Wuhan Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters; Bai Chongxi Explains the War Situation; Emphasizes Winning the People and Implementing the People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi attended the expanded Memorial Week of the Wuhan Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters this morning and delivered a speech, emphasizing the importance of winning the people and implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Bai said: The overthrow of the Manchu Qing was a success of the Principle of People's Rights, and the defeat of Japan was a success of the Principle of Nationalism, and both had the support of the broad masses of the people. The main reason why the military suppression of the rebellion is encountering setbacks today is that it is divorced from the people. To awaken the people and grasp the people, it is necessary to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood so that more than 80% of the farmers and workers can participate in the rebel suppression camp and thoroughly control the area. Bai praised the British Labour Party's achievements in stabilizing the people's livelihood and suppressing the Communist Party, and hoped that the provinces in Central China would first earnestly implement land reform. Finally, Bai pointed out that there are Korean Communists, Mongolian Communists, and Japanese Communists participating in the Chinese Communist Party, alerting the people not to be confused by the term "civil war," and firmly believing that "Heaven helps those who help themselves." If we can implement the Principle, the serious situation will definitely be reversed quickly.</p>

<h3>"Lenient Policy" is Terrible; Bandit's Means in Jinan are Vicious</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 29th] It is reported that when the bandits first occupied Jinan, they claimed to implement a lenient policy. The general public was tempted by this and returned to the city with their families. However, in less than a week, the bandits forced people aged 17 to 45 to form teams for training and fill out detailed information about their past experiences and education. Those considered suspicious were ordered to participate in "confession and reflection" conferences, forced to confess their crimes, transferred to the front line to serve as cannon fodder, or sent to our area for espionage work. However, in order to prevent them from defecting, the bandits concentrated the families of these dispatched personnel in a concentrated residence, euphemistically called "Preferential Management Office for the Families of Resisters," which was actually centralized supervision. If the work was not done well, their families would be secretly killed. The viciousness of the means is extreme.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Social Affairs Plans for Resettlement of 200,000 Refugees: Qingdao Refugees to be Sent to Jiangxi First, Dispatch Expected Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Ministry of Social Affairs is actively strengthening its efforts in refugee relief work. To help refugees become self-reliant and reduce the national burden, it is placing particular emphasis on production relief. It is learned that the Ministry has drafted a resettlement plan for 200,000 refugees, to be carried out in stages. It has consulted with relevant departments and decided that the first step is to move 50,000 refugees from Qingdao to Jiangxi for agricultural reclamation. The government will provide the necessary seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, oxen, housing, and food for the refugees. The government will also be responsible for transportation, food, and lodging along the way from Qingdao to Jiangxi. The total cost is estimated to be over 40 million gold yuan, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry has sent personnel to Jiangxi to liaise with the provincial government and to determine the reclamation areas and the number of people that each area can accommodate. Once these arrangements are finalized, personnel will be sent to Qingdao to assist the Qingdao municipal government in organizing and transporting the refugees. After the refugees arrive in Shanghai, they will be transferred in two routes. Relief stations will be set up along the way. The Jiangxi provincial government will be responsible for the protection and management of the refugees after they arrive in Jiangxi. The Ministry is actively preparing for this plan and expects to begin sending refugees next month.</p>

<h3>Neutral Countries Mediate Berlin Dispute: Propose New Plan to the Four Powers, Advocate Agreement on Currency Unification First So That the Berlin Blockade Can Be Lifted Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] It was learned today that the Chairman of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, presented another new plan to the representatives of the three countries, France, Britain, and the United States, when he met with them this morning, in an attempt to resolve the Berlin problem. According to reports, the same new plan was submitted to Soviet representative Vyshinsky by Bramuglia last night.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] The Berlin reconciliation plan proposed by the Argentine Foreign Minister hopes that currency experts from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and neutral countries will jointly draft a plan to implement the four-power agreement, stipulating that the Soviet-issued mark will be circulated throughout Berlin. The establishment of a currency agreement may lead to the lifting of the Berlin blockade.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] Bramuglia's term as President of the Security Council for this month is about to expire. He is scheduled to go to Rome on Wednesday evening. At that time, the presidency of the Security Council will be taken over by the Belgian representative. Bramuglia believes that his plan can continue to be implemented after his departure.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] The acting chief representative of the United States to the United Nations, Dulles, said tonight that the risk of another world war breaking out has been greatly reduced. Dulles made this statement based on the belief that the United Nations will achieve a final solution to the Holy Land issue and may promote an agreement between East and West on the Berlin dispute. Dulles said that the "miscalculation" risk is the greatest threat to peace. The majority of the world's intentions are against aggression. Hitler or Caesar's hope to overcome other countries one by one no longer exists. Regarding the Berlin issue, Dulles reiterated the position of Western countries, insisting that the Soviet Union must first lift the Berlin blockade before negotiating the Berlin issue or the entire German issue. He said that the Soviet authorities are taking steps almost daily to split Berlin in two, which makes the four-power agreement more difficult to implement. However, we still believe that the Berlin problem can be solved, and the Security Council may enable the Soviet government to end its efforts to obtain political and economic control of the entire city of Berlin.</p>
<h3>Political Committee Discusses Holy Land Issue: Jews Apply to Join the United Nations, Proposal to Withdraw Foreign Troops Postponed for Voting</h3>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] The UN Political Committee is preparing to resume discussions on proposals for a permanent solution to the Holy Land issue on the 29th, the one-year anniversary of the UN decision on the partition of Palestine. It is expected that Israel will also apply to join the UN organization on this day.</p>
<p>The various proposals have been compiled into a table, containing the resolutions and amendments proposed in this session of the General Assembly, for consideration by the committee. Most proposals provide for the establishment of a reconciliation committee to resolve border and political issues arising from the partition plan. The United States, Britain, and Australia all have such proposals. The Soviet Union and Poland demanded the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops and foreign military personnel from the Holy Land. Israel's application to join the organization must first be approved by the Security Council, requiring the consent of seven of the eleven council members. The United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, and Ukraine have clearly expressed their support, and only three more votes are needed from the other seven countries. According to well-informed sources in Britain, Britain's current position is that Israel should not be allowed to join the United Nations until the boundaries of the partition of Palestine are determined.</p>

<h3>Based on Hints from Various Allied Headquarters: Tojo et al. Executed by Hanging This Morning, MacArthur Formally Announces Support in Principle</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] According to a midday bulletin from the news liaison office here, the seven war criminals sentenced to hanging may have received notice that the executions will take place in 24 hours. However, the office did not directly state that it had issued the above notice, but only said that it had notified the prisoners that MacArthur supported the judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. It is believed that this statement is the 24-hour notice to the seven war criminals before their execution by hanging.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th, Associated Press] Japanese people believe that Hideki Tojo and other war criminals who have also been sentenced to death may be executed in the early hours of the 30th, as Tojo's two daughters have been granted permission to visit their father in prison.

Hirota's second son and third daughter were also allowed to enter the prison to visit him. Hirota's eldest son said that his father was wearing a military uniform and his attitude was no different from usual.</p>

<h3>Mei Ru'ao Gives a Detailed Account to Reporters on the Trial of Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>Tojo and Others Sentenced to Death; Eleven Judges Argued Heatedly, Ultimately Deciding on Hanging by a Vote of Six to Five.</p>
<p>From a Legal Perspective, the Japanese Emperor Cannot Wash Away His Suspicions as a War Criminal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] On the first Sunday after Tojo, Itagaki, Doihara, and Matsui, among other top Japanese war criminals, were sentenced to hang, reporters met Dr. Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, at the Imperial Hotel, where dignitaries of the occupying forces were lodged.</p>
<p>Judge Mei was one of the seven Allied judges responsible for drafting the court's historical "judgment," which spanned 1,218 pages. According to him, since the end of the court hearings around April of this year, when the drafting of the judgment began, his life for the past six months has been like that of a bookworm, buried in the nearly tens of thousands of pages of court documents and records.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters about the historical significance of the Tokyo Tribunal, Judge Mei first pointed out that the scale and duration of the trial set a new record in the thousands of years of human judicial history.</p>
<p>During the nearly two-year trial period, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East held more than 800 sessions, calling nearly a thousand witnesses. "Some witnesses came from as far away as China, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the United Kingdom to testify in Tokyo." Nearly 4,800 pieces of evidence were presented, and the entire court record reached 50,000 pages, totaling 9,682,000 words, with expenses exceeding US$7.5 million.</p>
<p>In this regard, Judge Mei said that the Tokyo Tribunal could be said to be the largest trial in human history, and its 1,200-page judgment was also the longest judgment ever written.</p>
<p>In its judgment, the Tokyo Tribunal not only firmly upheld that aggressive war is an international crime and emphasized individual war responsibility, but also further ruled that civilian cabinet members should bear the same responsibility as military commanders for the atrocities committed by the military.</p>
<p>Judge Mei believed that this showed that the Tokyo Tribunal was more advanced than the Nuremberg Tribunal and was a further contribution of the Tokyo Tribunal to modern international law.</p>
<p>Judge Mei then gave a very detailed analysis and explanation of the Tokyo Tribunal's judgment, which was about 1,200 pages long.</p>
<p>The first hundred pages of the judgment describe the course and procedures of the trial and establish the legal basis applicable to each defendant. The next five hundred pages can be said to be a history of the Japanese militarists' conspiracy of aggression, pointing out how the Japanese militarists seized power, controlled power, and launched a series of aggressive wars.</p>
<p>In another five hundred pages of the judgment, an individual historical account is given of the series of aggressive wars waged by Japan, of which 250 pages are about China.</p>
<p>The final hundred pages or so can be said to be a history of the atrocities committed by the Japanese army, with the Nanjing Massacre being referred to as "one of the most heinous events" in the history of human civilization.</p>
<p>From the proportion of pages in the judgment, Judge Mei pointed out that the International Military Tribunal attached great importance to Japan's war of aggression against China. The court believed that the Japanese militarists' conspiracy and all aggressive wars began with the Mukden Incident. Judge Mei said that this must be said to be "the fairest historical assessment."</p>
<p>The severity of the sentences imposed on the twenty-five defendants was also based on this determination. Judge Mei said that among the seven war criminals sentenced to hang, at least five were directly related to the invasion of China: Doihara Kenji, who was known throughout China as the "head of special services" for creating the Mukden Incident; Itagaki Seishiro, who once dreamed of becoming the "Emperor of China"; Matsui Iwane, the head of the Nanjing Massacre; and Hirota Koki, the author of the "Three Hirota Principles." Tojo Hideki's main crime was undoubtedly launching the Pacific War, but his crimes in the Northeast during his time in the Kwantung Army and his policy of insisting on continuing the invasion of China during his time as Minister of the Army were also major crimes that earned him the death penalty.</p>
<p>Compared with the Nuremberg Tribunal, some say that the sentences of the Tokyo Tribunal were too harsh, while others say they were too lenient. In the Nuremberg Tribunal, three defendants were acquitted, while in the Tokyo Tribunal, except for Shigemitsu Mamoru and Togo Shigenori, who were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, the remaining twenty-three defendants were all sentenced to death or life imprisonment. From this point of view, the latter was stricter than the former, but judging solely from the number of defendants sentenced to death, the latter seemed to be more lenient than the former.</p>
<p>According to Judge Mei's explanation, the issue of the death penalty was the point on which the opinions of the eleven judges differed the most and the debate was the fiercest. The laws of the eleven countries represented by the eleven judges were different, so their opinions on sentencing were also different.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union and New Zealand, the death penalty had long been abolished, so the judges of the two countries naturally strongly opposed sentencing war criminals to death. The United Kingdom and Australia had partially abolished the death penalty, so the judges of the two countries were also unwilling to vote for the death penalty. The Australian judge even advocated exiling war criminals to remote islands. As for the Indian judge, he opposed the trial of war criminals from beginning to end, advocating the acquittal of all defendants. Therefore, when the full court meeting discussed the issue of the death penalty, everyone argued heatedly and became very agitated. Finally, when it came to a vote, it was only with a majority of six to five votes that the use of hanging was approved.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Judge Mei pushed up his tortoiseshell glasses with his right hand and said: For this problem, I don't know how much effort and energy I spent among my colleagues. For a whole week, I was so worried that I couldn't sleep well at night. If I couldn't even get a death sentence for these heads of the extremely heinous Japanese invaders of China, what face would I have to go back and see my elders in Jiangdong?</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the issue of the Japanese Emperor's suspicions as a war criminal, Judge Mei made the following statement to reporters:</p>
<p>"From a purely legal point of view, the Japanese Emperor cannot wash away his suspicions as a war criminal. In the two and a half years of the trial, we obtained countless pieces of evidence sufficient to prove that even if he was not one of the initiators of the Japanese conspiracy of aggressive war, he was at least a passive participant in the conspiracy. This alone is enough to constitute the crime of accessory.</p>
<p>We judges can only try and sentence the defendants listed in the indictment. The Emperor's name was not in the indictment, so the court could not try him. As for why he was not prosecuted, that is probably a political issue."</p>
<p>Judge Mei pointed out that the Japanese Emperor and the Emperor system are two different things. Although the Potsdam Declaration gave the Japanese people the freedom to choose a form of government (including the Emperor system), it did not give the Japanese or anyone else the right to shield the Japanese Emperor from war responsibility.</p>
<p>Even MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, did not have the right or qualification to declare Japanese Emperor Hirohito innocent. Judge Mei emphasized.</p>
<p>"To determine whether Emperor Hirohito is guilty or not, from a legal point of view, can only be resolved in an international court." Judge Mei said.</p>
<p>The International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Judge Mei continued, had no intention of shielding Emperor Hirohito from war responsibility. In the judgment, the facts are stated frankly. If someone takes passages out of context and extracts one or two paragraphs from the judgment to promote their own claims, then this is not something the International Military Tribunal can be responsible for and is irrelevant to the full text of the judgment.</p>

<h3>Late-Night Bloodshed at the Jinshan Hotel: Army Officer Dies from Gunshot Wounds This Morning; Assailant Escapes, Female Teacher Detained in Connection</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] A shooting occurred in Room 221 of the Jinshan Hotel on Hankou Road at approximately 10:43 PM last night. The victim was Leng Jingbo (29, from Tianjin), a lieutenant colonel of infantry and staff officer in the 9425th unit of the Army. He was shot in the right chest, with the bullet not exiting. Leng immediately fell to the ground in response, with blood splattering everywhere. The assailant immediately rushed out the door and fled. Afterwards, the teahouse waiter hurriedly reported to the accounting office, who in turn reported to the Laozha Police Substation. Officer Tang Zhiliang was dispatched with police to pursue and apprehend the assailant, but he had already gone far away. Four spent bullet casings were later found in the room. The gun belonged to the victim, Leng Jingbo, and was numbered 440891. An ambulance was immediately summoned and rushed to the Renji Hospital for treatment. At the time, Leng's girlfriend, Cai Xiuda, was outside the room. Cai, 24, is a teacher at the Central National Primary School in Xiyongchang Town, Huangdai Township, Suzhou, and was taken back to the substation for questioning. According to Cai's statement, Leng arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd from Tangshan, accompanied by two adjutants, and lived alone in the said room. When Leng's army was stationed in Suzhou, they were introduced to each other and became friends. A few days ago, he sent a letter to Suzhou inviting her to Shanghai for a short stay, and she had just arrived this afternoon. As for the assailant, she only knew his surname was Wang, and did not know his full name. She had met him before at a banquet. At around 9 PM in the evening, the man surnamed Wang arrived and they chatted. There was a conflict between them in their words. After a while, a phone call came from outside, and Leng went to the front desk to answer it. This call was probably for the assailant, surnamed Wang. Leng immediately replied that he was not here and hurriedly returned to the room. At that time, the man surnamed Wang insisted on pushing her out, and Leng also did not want her to stay in the room, so she lingered outside the door. She speculated that the two sides seemed to have some negotiation going on that they did not want her to know. When the door was closed, before they had spoken a few words, she suddenly heard several gunshots, and then saw Wang open the door and rush downstairs with a gun. When she entered the room to check, she found that Leng had fallen in a pool of blood, barely breathing. She said that the argument between the two of them had lasted about an hour or so. According to the waiter at the establishment, the assailant, surnamed Wang, came here every day and sometimes went out together. After the investigating police officers searched and seized many letters, one of which was from Leng to Cai Xiuda, the text mentioned, "Since you are already engaged to Mr. Zuo Xiannan, I deeply hope for a happy marriage and wish you both a long life together. However, there are a few words that concern Mr. Wang. This person is terrible, often playing with guns, and plotting to harm me." Whether the assailant is indeed the man surnamed Wang is currently under detailed investigation by the substation. It was also discovered in Leng's wallet two engagement announcements clipped from the newspaper, with the man being Leng himself and the woman named Mei Shuying, who were engaged at 3 PM on April 4, 1948, in Changchun. After Leng was shot and sent to the hospital, surgeons performed an operation, but he ultimately died at approximately 2 AM this morning due to the bullet hitting a vital area and excessive blood loss. It is understood that the homicide case may be related to a love affair. The substation interrogated Leng's girlfriend, Cai Xiuda, overnight, and detectives were dispatched in all directions to apprehend the fugitive assailant.</p>

<h3>Worker Allotment of Coal Briquettes to Be Distributed on the 6th of Next Month; 25 Jin Per Person, Price 17 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The distribution of daily necessities for workers and their families in this city was originally scheduled to begin in November, but due to delays in procedures and insufficient preparation, it has not yet been distributed. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has prepared the distribution of coal briquettes and has scheduled a date for distribution. The original plan was to distribute 50 jin per person based on a certificate, but it has now been changed to 25 jin of original coal briquettes made of pure coal dust, priced at 17 yuan, to be distributed starting December 6. The Social Affairs Bureau stipulates that industrial and occupational unions will collect the payments and issue the briquettes centrally. The payment will be advanced by the manufacturers and deducted from the workers' wages later. Each coal briquette factory will deliver the goods based on the notification slip from the Civil Affairs Committee. Each manufacturer is required to submit the payment for the required coal briquettes to the Civil Affairs Committee for collection before December 4 and issue a notification slip, which can be used to pick up the goods from the coal briquette factory.</p>
<p>The current distribution of coal briquettes to workers and their families involves a total of 320,000 units, requiring 16,000 tons of coal dust. As for the calculation of coal briquette prices when compiling the cost of living index, ordinary coal briquettes will still be used as the standard. Now, each person is allocated 25 jin of original coal briquettes priced at 17 yuan, which is equivalent to 34 yuan per unit of ordinary coal briquettes.</p>

<h3>Stamping of Identity Cards to Be Handled by Bao Offices; Starts Tomorrow Without Time Restrictions</h3>
<p>The new national identity cards with shopping permits previously issued in this city have been cut open by many citizens. It was previously stipulated that citizens should properly paste them together themselves and send them directly to the Civil Affairs Bureau for the bureau's seal to be stamped across the seam where the card was pasted, before being returned for use. However, since the process began the day before yesterday, the crowds have been extremely large and congested. Therefore, the method has been changed: the official seals will be stamped by the offices of each "bao." According to Civil Affairs Bureau Director Zhang, "It has been reported that a small number of citizens mistakenly cut off the shopping permits from the newly issued identity cards. Therefore, the municipal government decided on the above method. Initially, we did not expect that so many people would cut them off. Although the bureau had scheduled stamping dates for each district, the crowding over the past two days has been unbearable. In this crowded state, 'scalpers' have infiltrated and are charging fees to cut in line, and there are even printed statements requesting stamping that are being privately sold for two or three yuan each. This is illegal. After the scalpers infiltrated and started operating, it became even more difficult to maintain order, and the bureau had to suspend the stamping process. Now, to make it easier for citizens to get their cards stamped and to eliminate illegal profiteering by scalpers, the process has been changed so that each district office will instruct each 'bao' office to stamp the 'bao' seal on them starting on the first day of next month. There are no time restrictions, and it is not necessary to send them to the bureau for stamping, to avoid unnecessary travel and crowding."</p>

<h3>Kwang Hua University Decides Not to Increase Tuition; Students Launch Fundraising Campaign for Teachers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Because the university decided not to increase tuition and miscellaneous fees for the second time, the students of private Kwang Hua University, in order to express their gratitude to the professors who continue to maintain their teaching despite financial difficulties, the students of the Departments of Politics and Law have initiated a joint effort with students from the entire university to organize a Teachers Appreciation Campaign Committee to raise 200,000 yuan as Teachers Appreciation Funds. Fundraising will be conducted from now until the end of December from alumni and all sectors of society. The fundraising methods include donations, charity sales, charity performances, and charity matches. The students of the university also hope that other schools can respond to this Teachers Appreciation Campaign. The Kwang Hua University Teachers Appreciation Campaign Donation Announcement states: "Jade must be carved to become a useful object, and people must learn to attain reason. Those who inherit the wisdom of the sages and enlighten future generations, and those who uphold culture and promote scholarship, are none other than teachers. Therefore, the achievements of teachers are indeed great. Since the War of Resistance, the people's livelihood has declined, and the cost of living has increased daily. However, the professors of our school are happy in their pursuits and content in their poverty, and they are dedicated to nurturing talents. They do not seek satisfaction in food, nor do they seek comfort in housing. They are not swayed by wealth and status, nor are they moved by poverty and humility. Gentlemen enjoy their pursuits, and this is always the case. Unfortunately, since the change in the currency system, prices have risen even more sharply, and the income of the professors is barely enough to feed themselves, let alone support their families. Now, the professors do not complain or blame, and the sound of their teaching has not ceased for a single day. The students, benefiting from their influence and guidance, discussed among themselves, saying that the way of the teacher should be respected, and that the work of the teacher is beneficial to the country and blesses future generations, and should be respected by all in the world. Therefore, we have launched a Teachers Appreciation Campaign to raise funds to reward their labor. We hope that wise men in the country and pioneers in society will respond to the call, save the scholarly atmosphere from being suppressed, and uphold the respect that should be given to the way of the teacher. Then the country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. This is the announcement."</p>

The District Court held that the defendant was unable to perform his duties as a husband, and yesterday ruled that the marriage between the two parties was dissolved.</p>
<h3>City Police Bureau Plans to Request Uniform National Identity Card Design</h3>
<p>When checking the identities of travelers from various places, the City Police Bureau finds that the designs of identity cards from various provinces, cities, and counties are different, and the contents also vary greatly. It is often difficult for inspectors to distinguish between genuine and fake cards, and criminals take advantage of this to forge them and infiltrate the city, causing no small amount of harm. The police bureau is paying close attention to this matter, and has instructed personnel in the household registration section to quickly collect national identity cards from various provinces, cities, and counties for reference. However, to date, the household registration section of the bureau has collected hundreds of types of identity cards from various places. Taking Jiangsu Province alone, the colors and designs of identity cards issued by various counties are mostly different. The bureau is currently organizing the data and formulating proposals for improvement, and plans to submit them to the city government for forwarding to the Central Government, proposing to issue a uniform national identity card design for all provinces, cities, and counties, so that they can be used everywhere, facilitating inspection and preventing abuses.</p>

<h3>Loan for Exports to Begin Immediately as Decided by Discount Committee Yesterday; Exchange Transfer Certificate Market Price Stable after Initial Rise</h3>
<p>The Central Bank Discount Committee convened a special meeting yesterday at noon, inviting responsible individuals from various banks and bureaus. Attendees included Yu Hongjun, Liu Gongyun, Lin Chong, Li Lixia, and Li Shuming, among over a dozen others, presided over personally by President Yu Hongjun. Regarding the restoration of loans by banks and bureaus, it is said that the meeting made two resolutions: (1) In the future, loans from various banks and bureaus will still be made from the banks' own deposits, with the principle of not increasing issuance. (2) Loans for important daily necessities and exports will be released earlier.</p>
<p>Another report: The market price of exchange transfer certificates rose sharply yesterday before stabilizing. It initially traded at 30 yuan, then rose to 30.5 yuan. Subsequently, exporters eagerly offered to sell, and the price returned to 28.75 yuan. The final price was 29.5 yuan, with increased trading volume compared to before. The Bank of China's remittance exchange rate rose by 2 yuan to 34 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, credit was slightly tighter than before, with overnight interest rates rising by 0.3 to 0.35 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.9 to 1.05 yuan. Today being the end of the month, credit conditions may continue to tighten.</p>
<h3>National Bank Imposes No Restrictions on Quantity of Gold and Silver for Deposit and Exchange</h3>
<p>Outside of Nanjing, Shanghai, and other locations, the authorities have decided that the handling of deposit and exchange services in all other regions will commence on time starting tomorrow. The Central Bank has been stepping up the transportation of gold and silver in recent days. As of yesterday morning, the gold and silver needed by over twenty locations had been sent separately by special planes from the bank, averaging over 10,000 taels of gold per location.</p>
<p>According to the responsible personnel of the bank: In recent days, due to the fluctuations of black market gold prices in the city, the number of people applying for exchange has become more and more enthusiastic. Those outside who do not understand the truth spread rumors of raising the exchange price and restricting exchange. Aside from the rumor of adjusting the exchange price having been disproven, the rumor of restricting the amount of exchange can also be verified as unfounded. Up until now, the Central Bank has never stipulated the amount of exchange.</p>
<p>Exchanging Gold and Silver Becomes More Crowded</p>
<p>Another report: The exchange of gold and silver for deposits was even more enthusiastic yesterday. The Central Bank and the three agencies of the Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Central Trust were all extremely crowded. A person in charge at the Central Bank stated: All exchanges this time require cash, so the procedure of counting banknotes is more troublesome, and the speed of exchange is not as ideal. The sudden increase in exchange is due to the rise in the black market price and the increase in the price of gold in Hong Kong. Generally speaking, unless there are special reasons, the black market will not fluctuate again.</p>
<p>No Restrictions on Sale of Gold Jewelry</p>
<p>According to Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the Shanghai Gold and Silver Trade Association, he told reporters: Regarding the reports that the industry has recently sold a large amount of jewelry, and for the sake of restriction, stipulated that 50 copper plates would be issued each day, and sales would be suspended if the quota was exceeded, this is not the case. However, because the source of jewelry for most businesses has not yet been resolved, they are all living within their means. As for purchasing jewelry, there are no restrictions. Anything from one qian to several liang can be purchased.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance to separately formulate Four Measures for Special Circumstances Regarding Capital Increase of Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Finance, regarding those who have special circumstances and cannot go through the capital increase procedures according to the regulations, has separately formulated four measures: (1) All head offices and branches that are already in the occupied areas will be allowed to go through the capital increase procedures according to regulations within two months after the local areas are recovered and business is restored. (2) All head offices located in occupied areas, but with branches continuing to operate in free territories, will be temporarily allowed, before the head office can adjust its capital according to law, to deposit cash equivalent to one-tenth of the minimum capital amount standard of the location of each existing branch in the Central Bank, which will be returned after three months. Afterwards, if a branch resumes business, it should follow these regulations, and after the location of the head office is recovered and business is restored, go through the capital adjustment procedures within two months and increase the capital to the prescribed standard. (3) All head offices and branches located near the occupied areas, unable to operate, and having suspended business on their own and reported to the Ministry, will be allowed to go through the capital increase procedures according to law within two months after resuming business. (4) For banks with enemy or puppet shares, if the original enemy or puppet shares have not been completely handled according to law, the capital increase portion of its assets should still be handled according to regulations. As for the cash portion of the capital increase, in addition to other shareholders paying according to their share ratio, the enemy or puppet shares will be allowed to be paid up within one month after the handling is completed. Before the handling of these enemy or puppet shares is completed, the Ministry will send a letter to the relevant enemy or puppet property handling agencies to send personnel to represent the exercise of shareholder rights.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Stable, Cotton Cloth Market Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was firm but ended lower due to persistently narrow sales. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at 13,000 yuan.

Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose slightly by 100 to 300 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened firm and stable in the morning. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened 10 yuan higher. Subsequently, due to the continuous large-scale search by the Guangdong and Hankou gangs, the buying atmosphere was strong.

Near noon, absorption was rarer, floating households settled not lonely, and the price fell back to 460 yuan at closing, up 15 yuan from the weekend.</p>

<h3>Abundant Arrivals, People's Hearts Weak, Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Flour, Grain, and Cooking Oil Mostly Decline</h3>
<p>The trend of falling rice prices intensified. Arrivals surged. Yesterday, a total of 13,202 shi arrived in the North and South markets. Prices in the production areas fell, and people's hearts were weak. Rice shops took very little intake, and it was difficult to sell. Cargo owners reduced prices for sale, and prices fell sharply. White Geng in the North market fell to 400 yuan, a sharp drop of 40 yuan compared to last week, a full 10%. Thin paddy also retreated to 400 yuan, early rice only 370 yuan, and other indica rice, etc., all fell by about 40 yuan. White Geng in the South market fell by 30 yuan, early rice fell by 40 yuan, and the market was very weak.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Turned to decline, due to the reported drop in rice prices, coupled with the downstream of the Tin City, people's hearts were depressed, actual sales contracted, and prices fell quite a bit. Old Car Flour opened and fell to 136 yuan, then fell further to 134 yuan, a sharp drop of 156 yuan from last Saturday. Bingchuan Flour was 132 yuan, also down more than 10 yuan, and other miscellaneous brand flours all fell by more than 10 yuan. Bran also fell by 10 yuan, retreating to 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>

<h3>The First Round of the Battle of Xuzhou (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Special Report from Bengbu on the 26th] On the third day of the outbreak of the Battle of Xuzhou, the reporter passed through Zhenjiang on the way to Nanjing and met Cao Zunxian, the director of the military affairs department of that army. When talking about the battle situation on the eastern front of Xuzhou, Director Cao told me that the National Army would definitely win in the Battle of Xuzhou. He told reporters that their troops were near Nianzhuang. His return this time was because military supplies were urgently needed to be transported north, and he would return to the front in a day or two. At that time, I said to Director Cao, "When you return to the front, please say hello to Jinggong (General Zhou's courtesy name is Jingfang) for me!"</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, the focus of the battle has always been on the eastern wing. Amidst the frequent reports of victory, the reporter not only cheered for the victory of the National Army, but also prayed for the safety of several old acquaintances among the generals on the eastern front, such as Qiu Qingquan, Huang Baitao, and General Zhou, whom I am about to write about here. General Zhou has returned from being a prisoner. This news made me concerned about his health, but even more so, it filled me with infinite respect for General Zhou's spirit.</p>
<p>Victory in Two Battles of Tai</p>
<p>General Zhou is from Jiangxi and graduated from the fourth class of the military academy. During the War of Resistance, he was promoted to the commander of the 51st Division of the 74th Army due to his military exploits, and together with Zhang Lingfu and Li Tianxia, he was Wang Yaowu's right-hand man. In the middle of the War of Resistance, the 100th Army was established in Hunan, and Generals Li Tianxia and Zhou were appointed as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. In the process of suppressing the rebellion, the name of the 100th Army will not be unfamiliar to the people across the country. The Communist bandits launched their first offensive in the all-out rebellion in the Liangtai area of northern Jiangsu. It was the 100th Army that gave a fierce blow to the invading Communist bandits in the special circumstances at the time, crushing their dream of capturing Yangtai and threatening Nanjing and Shanghai. What's more, before that (during the War of Resistance), the 100th Army had won as many as seventeen certificates of military merit awarded by the Military Commission. In the subsequent pacification campaigns in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, the 100th Army was even more victorious in every battle. The reason why the 100th Army was able to become a glorious unit with a "new army" (his number was the last one, there was no 101st Army). This was obviously entirely due to the effective leadership of Generals Li and Zhou. General Li Tianxia is now the deputy commander of the First Pacification Zone. He left the 100th Army in the summer of last year. After General Li left, General Zhou was promoted to commander, which had a familiar effect.</p>
<p>By the Ancient Yellow River</p>
<p>In March of this year, Chen Yi's bandit Second Column fled from southern Shandong to northern Jiangsu, and together with the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns originally in northern Jiangsu, attempted to move south to the Jianggan, realizing their crazy idea of "crossing the river in May." In mid-May, General Zhou was ordered to lead his troops from Linyi south to northern Jiangsu again to suppress the remaining bandits. The reporter followed the army's actions and fought all the way to Dezhen, the old nest of the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu on the coast of the Yellow Sea. The three columns of Chen Yi's troops, in addition to being embarrassed and broken, had no choice but to escape and hide in the area north of the Longhai Railway. The reporter had followed them on two occasions to do interviews. On horseback, in a jeep, General Zhou shuttled back and forth on both sides of the ancient Yellow River, and the reporter followed together for more than two weeks. By mid-June, the main force of Chen Yi's army had fled from northern Shandong to western Shandong, and when Yanzhou was under heavy siege by the Communist bandits, General Zhou's troops were transferred to the Jinyutai line again.</p>
<p>Serious and Profound</p>
<p>Among the generals the reporter personally came into contact with, Zhou was undoubtedly one of the generals with a serious attitude towards life. During the days the reporter spent with him, which added up to about three or four months, the reporter never saw him gamble once. In addition to books, he had a set of Chinese chess when he was not on military affairs. He also carried a set of "Poker" with him, but he was not preparing it for "Sha Crab" or "Russian Poker." This was what he was preparing for four people to play "Bridge." On the front line, the reporter had played this game with Zhou for several nights. Sometimes he would have interesting disputes with me over points. The reason why Zhou was addicted to these two pastimes was probably because Chinese chess required profound strategy and bridge required accurate estimation and judgment. As for wine and women, they had nothing to do with Zhou.</p>
<p>When the reporter and Zhou were parting in northern Jiangsu, he gave me a Communist bandit's "sickle flag" that had been intercepted as a souvenir. He also inscribed words on it. I clearly remember the following sentences: "The Communist bandits plant opium poppies everywhere in their so-called "liberated areas" and hang the Soviet flag. Isn't this ironclad proof of poisoning the people and selling out the country and the nation?" Through the small matter of personal acceptance, General Zhou still revealed his inner sense of justice in these small details. Therefore, it was by no means accidental that the 100th Army was able to win battles.</p>
<p>Gathering in Lanfeng</p>
<p>On June 25, the reporter followed Qiu Qingquan's corps from eastern Henan to press on to Kaifeng. At that time, Liu Maoen, the former chairman of Henan Province who broke out of Kaifeng, was living in the headquarters of the 100th Army stationed in Lanfeng. That day, General Qiu Qingquan received the news and immediately sent a car to pick him up. The reporter and Xiong Xiaosan, commander of the 5th Army, also went to General Zhou's place to welcome and comfort Liu. This was another meeting with General Zhou, and the gathering was very pleasant.</p>
<p>Infinite Nostalgia</p>
<p>From the 100th Army to the reorganized 83rd Division, and then from the reorganized 83rd Division to the 100th Army, the reporter has very deep feelings for every officer and soldier in this unit. Now, General Zhou was unfortunately injured while supervising the battle and flew to Shanghai for medical treatment. The reporter is on the edge of the artillery fire, and in addition to extending his best wishes to General Zhou for a speedy recovery, he also expresses his great nostalgia for the other generals and all the officers and soldiers of the army, whose current situation is still unknown!</p>
<h3>Tragic Incident of Being Buried Alive: Leprosy Patient Screams in Coffin</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Changsha on the 27th] Leprosy is prevalent in Shoufu Township, Daoxian County, Hunan. The villagers do not know how to treat it and superstitiously believe that leprosy patients will infect their direct relatives after death. Therefore, they bury patients alive, hoping to eliminate the source of the disease. A man named Wang Zhen unfortunately contracted leprosy. His family was afraid of being infected, so they discussed it with the patient and carried out a live burial. To ensure the safety of his descendants, the patient agreed to be buried alive. Therefore, the family killed chickens and ducks, bought meat and wine, and prepared a feast to mark the farewell. After eating, Wang suddenly thought of the horror of death and fled into the mountains. After a few days, he returned because he could not bear the hunger, and said again that he was willing to be buried. The family prepared another feast to bid him farewell. After eating, they placed the coffin at the door and forced him into the coffin. Wang, in desperation, crawled into the coffin with tears filling his eyes. Then they covered the coffin and nailed it down. Wang, in the coffin, kept calling out, "Don't nail my head!" Everyone who heard it was terrified!</p>
<h3>Pudong Nanhui Implements 3-1 Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Big Landlords Take the Lead in Advocating Rent Only Half of Previous Years</p>
<p>[Nanhui, 25th] The majority of the land within a hundred square li of Pudong is arable. A majority of its 1.3 million people are farmers. Within this vast rural area, a movement has been sparked this year: "3-1 Rent Reduction," a significant event unprecedented in the past. Several large landowners have personally requested the county magistrate to announce the implementation of 3-1 rent reduction, indicating their willingness to take the lead. The largest landowners in Pudong own 1,200 mu of land. They have realized that the trend of "land to the tiller" is natural. This time, Nanjiang County first implemented the 3-1 rent reduction (Nanjiang County accounts for about half of Pudong's area). A Rent Evaluation Committee has been established, which held a meeting the other day to assess the rent levels for the entire county as follows: (1) The Shakan area, primarily producing cotton and miscellaneous grains, has a maximum rent level of 40 jin of beans per mu. (2) The Tuantian area and the area east to the Shakan area, primarily producing cotton, rice, and miscellaneous grains, have a maximum rent level of 3 dou 3 sheng of white rice per mu after the 3-1 rent reduction. (3) The Tuqu area, primarily producing cotton and rice, has a maximum rent level of 4 dou 6 sheng of white rice per mu.</p>
<p>Such low rent levels are unprecedented, about half or less of previous years. In the past, Tuantian had to collect over 1 shi of rice in rent; now, it only has over 4 dou, which is a great benefit for tenant farmers. Township and town tenant rent evaluation committees have now been established. The committees are composed of three landlords, three tenant farmers, and one representative each from the government, the council, and the farmers' association. Everyone unanimously advocates that they will never allow landlords with backward and conservative ideas to take control.</p>
<p>In addition to Nanjiang's pioneering implementation, Fengxian has also assessed a lower rent level. It is heard that other counties will also follow suit and launch the rent reduction movement.</p>
<h3>Major Corruption Case in Hunan Food Bureau: Secret in Green Suitcase to be Heard in Court</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Changsha on the 27th] The corruption case of Huang Dean, the former director of the Hunan Provincial Food Bureau, involved a green suitcase containing secret documents during the prosecutor's investigation. The secrets within were not disclosed by the court during the investigation, leading to much speculation from the outside world. The so-called "secret of the green suitcase" has been widely rumored for a while. Huang's case was publicly heard for the first time on the 26th. The defendant's testimony was only completed from 9:00 am to about 9:00 pm. Other related parties will continue to be heard in court on the 27th. In Huang Dean's testimony, the "secret of the green suitcase" has been fully revealed, and the facts of the case will not be difficult to clarify.</p>
<h3>Order to Investigate the Food Command's Flat Price for Grain in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi on the 26th] The Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters recently received an order from the Presidential Palace to quickly and thoroughly investigate the Wuxi County's extraction of 20% of exported grain, which was settled at 60% of the market price for a flat price, what basis it was based on, when it was implemented, and how much had been extracted up to the date of the document, and how the implementation of the 5% levy on exported food was being handled. After receiving the order, the county government stated that since the mandatory price limit policy, transportation bans and obstacles have been imposed everywhere, and everyone has been acting on their own. At that time, the Food Department and the Shanghai Civil Investigation Committee were purchasing a large amount of grain in Wuxi. For the sake of safety, the county's Flat Price Committee extracted 20% of the rice being shipped out for flat price, in order to limit the price increase. Although it knew that there was no legal basis for this and it would easily attract criticism, those who did not know the truth believed that the county was hindering grain transportation, which it deeply regretted. In addition to truthfully reporting the facts, it also requested instructions on a proper method for the future.</p>

<h3>A Second Discussion on Chinese Cuisine</h3>
<p>— Le Zhi</p>
<p>The historical background of Chinese cuisine is worthy of study. In ancient times, people valued flavor, focusing on meat dishes, which retained the customs of the hunting and gathering era, and its monotony is self-evident. The artistic transformation of diet is truly a contribution of Taoism. Originally, Taoist products were the marrow of authentic Chinese culture, deeply influencing the nation's way of life, and diet is one aspect of this. The so-called "immortals gathering mushrooms" after the Qin and Han dynasties was a major advancement in diet. "Zhi" refers to fungi, including today's wood ear mushrooms, button mushrooms, fragrant herbs, and various other fungi, adding variety to flavors and benefiting health through nutrition. The ancients meticulously researched this, willing to abandon worldly affairs in pursuit of a better life, and their spirit is invaluable. By the Tang and Song dynasties, Buddhism had deeply penetrated Chinese culture, leading to great efforts in the use of bamboo shoots. Within this millennium, since Su Dongpo introduced "Jade Plate Zen" and Huang Shangu cursed the bamboo shoot not to become bamboo, a new realm was opened up. The Chinese delicacies we enjoy today still rely heavily on fungi and bamboo shoots. From this, we can see that Chinese cuisine is rich in religious art, representing both Taoism and Buddhism, reflecting the spiritual life of the higher intellectual class, harmonious and indifferent, transcending the material world, and its flavors are endlessly far-reaching. In modern times, tofu has been added. Everyone knows the benefits of tofu, so there's no need to discuss it further. Speaking of its artistic significance, its wonder lies in its neutrality. It is flavorless in itself, yet it enhances the deliciousness of other dishes and mitigates their flaws. This is another subtle point worthy of contemplation. Some people disapprove of the excessive use of tofu products in vegetarian dishes. Indeed, this is a common habit. Anything used too much or done excessively is not good. Vegetarian chefs excessively seek form and do not properly utilize natural ingredients, relying solely on tofu and gluten as treasures, which is a major reason why people are afraid to eat vegetarian dishes. This should be improved.</p>
<p>Around the middle of the Ming Dynasty, after maritime transportation developed, Chinese cuisine underwent another major change, which was the ascendancy of seafood. The so-called "eight treasures" commonly used in the past (which were actually just imaginative terms) were mostly mountain delicacies, with very few mentions of marine products. Only in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties did people become aware of bird's nest, shark fin, and sea cucumber. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, official banquets commonly used bird's nest and shark fin as the main dishes. However, truly grand banquets still retained the old system, using roasted meats as the main dish. When the roasted meats were served, music was played, and the chef personally knelt to present them. The honored guests would give rewards, which was a vestige of ancient customs. During the Guangxu era, ordinary people still used bird's nest and shark fin as showy dishes, without truly studying their flavors. Especially bird's nest, it was "respected but not intimate." Only in the late years did people come up with various new methods for cooking shark fin, even specializing in eating shark fin, with other dishes merely serving as an afterthought. This was a change in Chinese culture after maritime trade opened up. However, it should be noted that this way of eating shark fin has already become Sinicized, and the market for shark fin can be said to be exclusively in China. The Chinese nation's ability to assimilate the strengths of others and transform them into its own is also evidence of this.</p>

<h3>Lost Articles</h3>

<p>When I was a child, my tutor taught us to read "Guan Zhi Ancient Prose," which we recited fluently, but we were quite ignorant of the content of the articles. The teacher spent a lot of effort explaining it, but we were not very interested. However, the "head-bowed and sleeping" boy in "Ode to the Autumn Sound" and the anonymous ancient musician "blowing the xiao" in "Ode to the Red Cliff" (later identified as the Taoist Yang Shichang) made us like them, as if they were very approachable. Also, when discussing "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng," the incidental mentions of how Wang Bo dreamed of the water god assisting with the wind, how he rushed to the Nine-Day Pavilion banquet, how he refused to yield at the banquet, and how his witty remarks overwhelmed the son-in-law were much more interesting to us children than "the falling glow and solitary egret fly together; the autumn water and the long sky share one hue." I remember having an idea at the time that the "draft" of that spoiled son-in-law might as well be brought out for everyone to appreciate. Since he was prepared to show off, it must not be bad. But it was eventually lost, which made me secretly feel sorry for Wu Zidan.</p>
<p>Also, in Old Du's "Feast for Su Duan and Xue Fu, A Song for Xue Hua When Drunk," there is a line: "In the seat, Xue Hua is good at singing drunken songs, the lyrics are self-composed and the style is old. Recently, in the world, the long poem is prominent, and you and Shandong Li Bai are well-regarded!" Could it be that Mr. Xue's "lyrics" were also overshadowed by Du Fu and were not sung among people? Every time I read this, I can't help but feel lingering fondness. Zha Taisan said: "Xue Hua's lyrics are mentioned alongside Li Bai, this old man (referring to Du Fu) is not one to give light praise, it is a pity that his poems are not passed down." I am afraid that Mr. Zha is not the only one who feels this way.</p>
<p>There must be no shortage of articles lost from ancient times. Modern people's collections of works are mostly self-edited, and they are added to and revised at any time, so there is no need to worry about loss.</p>
<h3>Inscription on Chen Xiaocui's Painting</h3>

<p>Spring departs, leaving only deep green grass,</p>
<p>Kudzu vines idly caress the painted silk,</p>
<p>The Taoist has completed the dream of three lifetimes,</p>
<p>And steps on the flowering branches without a stir of the heart.</p>
<p>The ribbon sashes follow the guests, jade characters wide,</p>

<p>A branch has already conveyed the news of spring,</p>
<p>The white sleeves withstand the cold wind.</p>
<p>As the year wanes, frozen birds struggle to sing,</p>
<p>Still, one sees silk stockings crossing the cold river,</p>
<p>High character should resemble autumn chrysanthemums and eagles,</p>
<p>No need for charming postures to describe Lingbo.</p>
<p>Standing quietly under the windy eaves, near faint fragrance,</p>
<p>With goods exhausted, how can one ask about the honey chamber?</p>
<p>In old age, I recall Wen Daizhao,</p>
<p>And fancifully inscribe it as Wang Lantang.</p>
<h3>The Failure of Confucianism</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Mozi said: "Righteousness is correctness; it must follow the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior, and there is no correctness of the inferior to correct the superior." Although these are Mozi's words, they are quite sufficient to represent the paradoxical political views of the general literati and officials in my country in the past. The paradox lies in: the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior must depend on an enlightened ruler, but an enlightened ruler is something that can be encountered but not sought. If the inferior must wait for an enlightened ruler to correct them, then if there is no enlightened ruler for a hundred years, the inferior will have to remain uncorrected for a hundred years; if there is no enlightened ruler for a thousand years, the inferior will have to remain uncorrected for a thousand years. This is precisely why my country has remained uncorrected for thousands of years. Moreover, examining history, there are rare examples of the superior being able to correct the inferior. There are naturally many examples of later generations correcting previous dynasties, but when later generations become "superiors," their uncorrectness remains the same, presumably because the inferior do not correct the superior.</p>
<p>"Must follow the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior," to put it more simply, is the rustic's hope for a "true son of heaven." The people of Western democratic countries do not initially fantasize about "the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior," and the reason why the superior has no choice but to be correct is because the inferior can correct the superior and constantly correct them.</p>
<p>But thinking about the Western political thought that we have discussed for thirty or forty years, in fact, there has been no achievement to date. Is the period too short? Then, the Confucian political views that we have discussed for two or three thousand years have never been truly implemented. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the principles spoken by the ancient sages of my country are correct, but the methods they used are wrong. Therefore, Confucianism failed from the beginning. Confucius and Mencius both traveled to various states for a long time, seeing this ruler one moment and talking to that king the next, bustling among the feudal lords, with no time to warm their seats. One cannot say that they did not work hard to promote their doctrines, but how much progress did they make? In fact, this is the inevitable result of taking the feudal lords as the object of persuasion. Is it to ask the feudal lords to give up their vested interests? Who would be willing?</p>
<p>The mistake of the sages of past dynasties in my country lies in the misconception that "the correctness of the inferior must follow the correctness of the superior." Therefore, if the superior is unwilling to correct, even sages like Confucius and Mencius have no way to do anything. In addition, they failed and did not know how to change their approach, so they had no choice but to retreat and write books. At that time, if those two could clearly recognize their target audience and emulate the actions of modern Englishmen, picking a crowded place in the park every day, standing on a soapbox and lecturing the public on their doctrines, putting the time and energy spent on persuading the feudal lords into this aspect, then the history of my country over the past two or three thousand years would definitely not have been written in this way. Thinking carefully about it, the effectiveness of Confucius and Mencius persuading the feudal lords to save the world is not as good as a one-person show program that the radio station has only broadcast for a week today. Hasn't Xiao Kuaile's opinion on raising tuition fees already attracted the attention of the entire city's citizens?</p>
<p>Most of the people in modern China who advocated Western political thought also made the same mistake as Confucius and Mencius. We only need to check the past articles on this type of topic, and we can know that although the content is imported, the tone is still in the style of memorials, full of hope that "the superior will correct the inferior," and most of them do not seem to be written for the people to read, so the people do not want to read them.</p>
<p>Having a feeling about this, the author honestly and unceremoniously changed Mozi's words to "must follow the correctness of the inferior to correct the superior, and there is no correctness of the superior to correct the inferior."</p>
<h3>The Miserly Sir</h3>
<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>Sir Harvey Ewes of Devonshire is known as the most miserly millionaire. Once, he had a niece visiting him at his home. Being inconsiderate, she was still sewing clothes by the light of a small kerosene lamp at nine o'clock at night, which made the Sir very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>"Put out that lamp!" Sir Ewes, who owned half a million pounds, finally couldn't bear it.</p>
<p>"But, uncle," his niece protested, "I need to wear that dress tomorrow! Besides, I bought the kerosene myself."</p>
<p>"I know, miss," the Sir said relentlessly, "but the wick burning in that lamp was bought by me!"</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>The young students of Eton College in England have always been known for their aristocratic ways. The students' "uniform hats" are all top hats. Although the children's faces are still childish, these "top hats" are full of spirit. However, recently, due to the conservation of materials, top hats have become difficult to buy, so the Eton students have had to abolish these "top hats" from now on.</p>
<p>There is a provision in Swedish law that all employees of any public or private institutions, banks, and shops in the country can take a two-week vacation each year, and their salaries will be paid during the vacation. Journalists and doctors are allowed to take a month off, and their salaries will be paid. This law has been implemented for ten years.</p>
<h3>Regarding Point Allocation Certificates</h3>
<p>— Cheng Lu</p>
<p>Last year, we public educators received a point allocation certificate once. The certificate was attached with small squares such as "Heaven, Earth, Mysterious, Yellow..." Each time, one piece was torn off for use, and a small amount of American military surplus materials was allocated, such as canned candies, etc. Daily necessities were very, very few, and most of the cans, etc., were moldy. But it soon stopped, and not to mention the "Thousand Character Classic," I am afraid that only quite a few characters were used.</p>
<p>Okay, now point allocation certificates have been issued again. Not long ago, I went to take a look, and there were still only things that could not be eaten as meals, luxury items, or moldy canned goods. Daily necessities were still very few. But each point is only counted as ten cents, a total of 150 points per month, equivalent to 15 Gold Yuan, and you can choose yourself, so naturally you can't say "not good," and everyone still agrees. However, as soon as public educators borrowed one and a half times their salary, the price of each point immediately increased by one and a half times, to be counted as twenty-five cents. This is not all, it has also been changed to be purchased in full by each institution. Not only is it in full, but you have to listen to their reward for what things are allocated! In this way, there is a strong sense of forced purchase, even more fierce than any store!</p>
<p>Now we are blessed by the government, and our salaries have been increased sixfold, so naturally the price of each point will also increase sixfold, then everyone has to pay 90 Gold Yuan per month. This amount, in the eyes of us small civil servants, is a huge sum of money. I really dare not predict how many people will dare to inquire?</p>
<p>When the institution I serve asked for my ID number (because in addition to making a list, the ID number must also be indicated), I had resolutely given up, because I wanted to save this money and buy more rice. If all my colleagues in the city do this, the authorities can permanently treasure these treasures and sell them as antiques in the future--in fact, aren't they already antiques now!</p>
<h3>Skin, Helmet and Party</h3>
<p>On the 22nd, various places began to deposit and exchange cash, on the one hand to bring the new banknotes back into circulation, and on the other hand to explain the real relationship between the new banknotes and gold and silver with facts, and restore credit, which is a supplement for the evening. On the first day in Tianjin, only one tael of gold was exchanged, and there was not much enthusiasm in Beiping either. The reason is that fixed deposits that last for a year have long been unfamiliar in the minds of the citizens. The one-year limit was originally a very ordinary "fixed term" in the normal era before the war, but in the era of economic transformation, what is taken at maturity often does not match one-tenth or even one-hundredth of what was deposited. Therefore, "fixed deposits" have not had a long term for a long time, but only one or two months, or even one week, and no one has a term of one year. At the beginning of the victory, the situation seemed to improve, but due to the situation, the economic transformation has increased without end, and the banks have no possibility of normal storage. Their advertisements to attract floating capital and attract deposits mostly compete with "short term and high interest." Everyone thinks that depositing money is not as good as storing goods. Long-term deposits are no different from abandonment. This is a habit created by history, and it cannot be completely attributed to "economic reform." However, since the accumulated mood is difficult to change suddenly, many people see "deposit one and exchange one" as no different from "exchange two for one," and the market price is about 1,500 or 1,600 Gold Yuan per tael of yellow goods, less than two numbers, so there are many people who want to get yellow goods and are willing to seek them in private markets (the situation of white goods is also the same). The official price is indeed lower than the market price, and it seems worthwhile for buyers. If the deposit is regarded as an equal part of the purchase price, then it feels higher than the market price.</p>
<p>Silver dollars have been the currency used throughout the country for many years, so they are different from gold banknotes. From the Qianqing era to before the Republic of China Incident, the impression of using silver dollars and copper coins in market transactions was extremely deep. Even when the "legal currency" was promoted in the 24th year of the Republic of China, it only stopped being redeemable. The so-called "yuan" on the legal currency notes specifically refers to silver dollars. The Customs Gold issued during the Anti-Japanese War and the current Gold Yuan are gold rather than silver, but the Customs Gold is still calculated according to the legal currency in the market. For example, if you sell and buy goods with 5,000 Customs Gold, you don't say 5,000 but say "100,000." The so-called 100,000 is still the legal currency, still referring to silver dollars. The Gold Yuan has no associated name with the legal currency, but at the beginning of the "economic reform," it was stipulated that two Gold Yuan are equal to one silver dollar. After the revision, ten Gold Yuan are equal to one silver dollar. The value of the Gold Yuan is even smaller than the silver dollar, so the identity of the silver dollar is more important, and the impression is more profound, so all aspects of praise and fading of edges are not accidental.</p>

There are naturally many examples of later generations correcting previous dynasties, but when later generations become "superiors," their uncorrectness remains the same, presumably because the inferior do not correct the superior.</p>
<p>"Must follow the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior," to put it more simply, is the rustic's hope for a "true son of heaven." The people of Western democratic countries do not initially fantasize about "the correctness of the superior to correct the inferior," and the reason why the superior has no choice but to be correct is because the inferior can correct the superior and constantly correct them.</p>
<p>But thinking about the Western political thought that we have discussed for thirty or forty years, in fact, there has been no achievement to date. Is the period too short? Then, the Confucian political views that we have discussed for two or three thousand years have never been truly implemented. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the principles spoken by the ancient sages of my country are correct, but the methods they used are wrong. Therefore, Confucianism failed from the beginning. Confucius and Mencius both traveled to various states for a long time, seeing this ruler one moment and talking to that king the next, bustling among the feudal lords, with no time to warm their seats. One cannot say that they did not work hard to promote their doctrines, but how much progress did they make? In fact, this is the inevitable result of taking the feudal lords as the object of persuasion. Is it to ask the feudal lords to give up their vested interests? Who would be willing?</p>
<p>The mistake of the sages of past dynasties in my country lies in the misconception that "the correctness of the inferior must follow the correctness of the superior." Therefore, if the superior is unwilling to correct, even sages like Confucius and Mencius have no way to do anything. In addition, they failed and did not know how to change their approach, so they had no choice but to retreat and write books. At that time, if those two could clearly recognize their target audience and emulate the actions of modern Englishmen, picking a crowded place in the park every day, standing on a soapbox and lecturing the public on their doctrines, putting the time and energy spent on persuading the feudal lords into this aspect, then the history of my country over the past two or three thousand years would definitely not have been written in this way. Thinking carefully about it, the effectiveness of Confucius and Mencius persuading the feudal lords to save the world is not as good as a one-person show program that the radio station has only broadcast for a week today. Hasn't Xiao Kuaile's opinion on raising tuition fees already attracted the attention of the entire city's citizens?</p>
<p>Most of the people in modern China who advocated Western political thought also made the same mistake as Confucius and Mencius. We only need to check the past articles on this type of topic, and we can know that although the content is imported, the tone is still in the style of memorials, full of hope that "the superior will correct the inferior," and most of them do not seem to be written for the people to read, so the people do not want to read them.</p>
<p>Having a feeling about this, the author honestly and unceremoniously changed Mozi's words to "must follow the correctness of the inferior to correct the superior, and there is no correctness of the superior to correct the inferior."</p>
<h3>The Miserly Sir</h3>
<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>Sir Harvey Ewes of Devonshire is known as the most miserly millionaire. Once, he had a niece visiting him at his home. Being inconsiderate, she was still sewing clothes by the light of a small kerosene lamp at nine o'clock at night, which made the Sir very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>"Put out that lamp!" Sir Ewes, who owned half a million pounds, finally couldn't bear it.</p>
<p>"But, uncle," his niece protested, "I need to wear that dress tomorrow! Besides, I bought the kerosene myself."</p>
<p>"I know, miss," the Sir said relentlessly, "but the wick burning in that lamp was bought by me!"</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>The young students of Eton College in England have always been known for their aristocratic ways. The students' "uniform hats" are all top hats. Although the children's faces are still childish, these "top hats" are full of spirit. However, recently, due to the conservation of materials, top hats have become difficult to buy, so the Eton students have had to abolish these "top hats" from now on.</p>
<p>There is a provision in Swedish law that all employees of any public or private institutions, banks, and shops in the country can take a two-week vacation each year, and their salaries will be paid during the vacation. Journalists and doctors are allowed to take a month off, and their salaries will be paid. This law has been implemented for ten years.</p>
<h3>About Point Rationing Certificates</h3>
<p>— Cheng Lu</p>
<p>Last year, we public educators received a rationing certificate once, with small squares inside marked with "Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow..." etc. Each time, we tore off a square to use, and were allocated a small amount of surplus American military supplies, like canned goods and candies. Daily necessities were very, very few, and most of the canned goods were moldy and rotten. But soon it stopped, and of the Thousand Character Classic, not to mention a thousand characters, I'm afraid only a few scattered characters were used.</p>
<p>Well, now point rationing certificates have been issued again. Not long ago, I went to take a look, and they were still all things that couldn't be eaten as food, luxuries, or moldy canned goods. Daily necessities were still very few. But each point is only counted as one jiao, and the entire month's 150 points add up to fifteen gold yuan. And you can choose for yourself, so naturally you can't say it's "bad," and everyone still agrees. But as soon as public educators borrowed one and a half times their salary, the price of each point immediately increased by one and a half times, counting as two and a half jiao. That's not all, it was also changed to be purchased in full by each agency. Not only in full, but what you get allocated depends on their "generosity"! In this way, it has a strong sense of forced purchase, even fiercer than any store!</p>
<p>Now we are graced by the government, and our salaries have been increased sixfold. Of course, the price of each point will also increase sixfold, so each person will have to pay ninety gold yuan per month. This amount, in the eyes of us small civil servants, is a huge sum. I really dare not predict how many people will dare to inquire?</p>
<p>When the agency I work for asked me for my ID number (because in addition to making a list, I also had to indicate my ID number), I resolutely gave up, because I wanted to save the money and buy more rice. If all my colleagues in the city do the same, the authorities might as well treasure these treasures forever and sell them as antiques in the future – in fact, aren't they already antiques now!</p>
<h3>Leather Helmet Gathering</h3>
<p>On the 22nd, deposits began to be cashed out in various places, on the one hand to bring new banknotes back into circulation, and on the other hand to explain the real connection between the new banknotes and gold and silver with facts, to restore credit. This is not a bad thing to do in one's twilight years. On the first day in Tianjin, only one tael of gold was exchanged, and the response in Beiping was also not very enthusiastic. The reason is that fixed deposits lasting up to one year have long been unfamiliar to the public. The one-year limit was originally a very common "fixed term" in the normal era before the war, but in this era of economic transformation, what you get at maturity often does not match one-tenth or even one-hundredth of what it could buy at the time of deposit. Therefore, "fixed deposits" have not had long terms for a long time, but only one or two months, or even ten days or a week. There has never been a one-year term. At the beginning of victory, the situation seemed to improve, but due to the situation, the economic transformation has only intensified. There is no possibility of normal operation for banks and stores. Their advertisements to absorb idle funds and attract deposits compete with each other with "short terms and high interest." Everyone believes that depositing money is not as good as stocking up on goods. Long-term deposits are tantamount to abandonment. This is a habit created by history and cannot be entirely blamed on "economic reform." However, since the accumulated feelings are difficult to change suddenly, many people see "depositing one and exchanging one" as no different from "exchanging two for one," and that the market price of one tael of gold is about 1500 or 1600 gold yuan, less than two numbers. Therefore, there are many people who want to obtain gold and are willing to seek it in the private market (the situation with silver is also the same). The official price is indeed lower than the market price, so it seems cost-effective for buyers. But if the deposit is considered as an equal part of the purchase price, then it feels more expensive than the market price.</p>
<p>Silver dollars have been the currency used nationwide for many years, so they are different from gold banknotes. From the late Qing Dynasty to before the incidents of the Republic of China, the impression of using silver dollars and copper coins in market transactions was very deep. Even when "legal tender" was promoted in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), it was only non-convertible. The so-called "yuan" on the legal tender banknotes refers to silver dollars. The customs gold issued during the Anti-Japanese War and the current gold yuan are gold rather than silver. However, customs gold was still used in the market according to the number of legal tender. For example, to buy something with 5,000 customs gold, people would not say 5,000 but "100,000." The so-called 100,000 is still legal tender and still refers to silver dollars. The gold yuan and legal tender have no connection in name, but at the beginning of the "economic reform," it was stipulated that two gold yuan were equivalent to one silver dollar. After the revision, ten gold yuan were equivalent to one silver dollar. The value of the gold yuan is less than that of the silver dollar. Therefore, the status of silver dollars is more important, and the impression is deeper. It is no coincidence that all parties are supporting it and the various relationships are fading.</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on Chinese Cuisine</h3>
<p>— Le Zhi</p>
<p>The historical background of Chinese cuisine is worthy of research. Ancient people emphasized flavor and taste, mainly with meat dishes, not straying from the customs of the nomadic era. Its monotony is self-evident. The artisticization of diet is really a contribution of Taoism. Originally, the products of Taoism are the true essence of Chinese culture, influencing the national way of life the most, and diet is one of them. After the Qin and Han dynasties, the so-called saying of immortals gathering herbs was a major advance in diet. Herbs are fungi, including the current wood ear, mushrooms, truffles, and various fungi, which increase changes in taste and benefit nutrition in terms of health. The ancients carefully studied and did not hesitate to get rid of worldly affairs in order to seek the upward development of life, and their spirit is invaluable. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Buddhism penetrated deeply into the Chinese cultural form, so they worked hard on bamboo shoots. Within this thousand years, since Su Dongpo proposed jade-like bamboo shoots and Huang Shangu cursed bamboo shoots not to become bamboo, a new realm has been opened up. The Chinese delicacies we enjoy today still have fungi and bamboo shoots as important ingredients. From this, we can know that Chinese cuisine is rich in religious art. One represents Taoism, and one represents Buddhism, reflecting the spiritual life of the higher intellectual class, harmonious, peaceful, and transcendent, and its taste is long and endless. In modern times, tofu has been added. Everyone knows the benefits of tofu, so there is no need to talk about it again. Speaking of artistic meaning, the beauty lies in moderation. Tofu itself is tasteless, but the deliciousness of other dishes is enhanced, and the partiality of other dishes is not harmful. This is another subtle point worth exploring. Some people do not approve of too many tofu products in vegetarian dishes. Indeed, this is the habit of the common people. It is not good to use things too much or make them too much. Vegetarian cooks are too formal and do not make use of natural ingredients, relying solely on tofu and gluten as magic weapons, which is really a big reason why people are afraid to eat vegetarian dishes. This is something that should be improved.</p>
<p>Probably in the middle of the Ming Dynasty, after the development of maritime traffic, Chinese cuisine underwent another major change, and that is the dominance of seafood. The so-called eight treasures that used to be popular (in fact, they were just imaginary words) were mostly mountain delicacies, and very few sea delicacies were mentioned. Only in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties did people know about bird's nest, shark fin, and sea cucumber. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, official banquets generally used bird's nest and shark fin as the main dishes. However, real grand banquets still retained the old system, with barbecue as the main dish. When serving barbecue, music was played, and the chef personally knelt down to offer it. Distinguished guests were rewarded with money, which was a vestige of ancient customs. In the Guangxu years, ordinary people still used bird's nest and shark fin as facade dishes and did not really bother to study the taste, especially bird's nest, which was "respected but not close." It was not until the end of the Qing Dynasty that people came up with various new ways to cook shark fin. Even eating only shark fin, and other dishes were just leftovers. This is a change in Chinese culture after maritime trade, but it must be known that this way of eating shark fin has become Chineseized, and the market for shark fin can also be said to be exclusively in China. This is also proof that the Chinese nation can absorb the strengths of others and transform them into its own.</p>

<h3>Lost Articles</h3>
<p>— Xi Hou</p>
<p>When I was a child, my private tutor taught us to read "Guan Zhi of Ancient Prose," which we recited fluently, but we were very ignorant of the content of the articles. The teacher tried hard to explain for a long time, but we were not interested. However, the "Autumn Sounds Fu" with the "child drooping his head and sleeping," and the "Red Cliff Fu" with the unnamed musician playing the flute (later found to be the Taoist Yang Shichang), made us like them, as if they were very approachable. Also, when talking about the "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng," the incidental mention of how Wang Bo dreamed of the water god helping with the wind, how he rushed to the Ninth Day Pavilion banquet, how he did not yield at the banquet, and how his brilliant sentences overwhelmed the son-in-law, these insertions were much more interesting to us children than "sunset and solitary birds flying together, autumn water and long sky in one color." I remember at the time that I had a thought that the "old draft" of the son-in-law might as well be taken out for everyone to enjoy. Since he was prepared to show off, it should not be bad. But it was finally lost, which made me secretly feel unfair for Wu Zi Dan.</p>
<p>Also, Du Fu's "Banquet at Su Duan and Xue Fu's Residence, Briefing Xue Hua's Drunken Song" has a sentence that says: "Xue Hua in the seat is good at drunken singing, the lyrics are his own and the style is old. Recently, the poems in the country are long sentences, you and Shandong Li Bai are good!" Could it be that Mr. Xue's "lyrics" were also overwhelmed by Du Fu and not sung in the world? Every time I read this, I can't help but feel nostalgic. Cha Taisun said: "Xue Hua's lyrics were mentioned alongside Li Bai, and this old man (referring to Du Fu) is not someone who praises lightly. It is a pity that his poems are not passed down." I'm afraid Mr. Cha is not the only one who feels this way.</p>
<p>There must be not a few articles lost from ancient times. Modern people's collections of essays are mostly self-edited and revised at any time, so there is no need to worry about loss.</p>
<h3>Inscription on Chen Xiaocui's Painting</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>Spring goes, only deep green grass remains, wisteria vines leisurely cling to the painting, the Taoist has finished his three lives dream, and treads on the flower branches without moving his heart.</p>
<p>The streamer from the guest's jade character is wide, and he looks at the wealth and honor of the world indifferently. A branch has already penetrated the news of spring, and the white sleeves endure the cold in the wind.</p>
<p>The frozen sparrows in the waning year are also difficult to sing, but you can still see the cold river passing the silk. High style should only be for autumn chrysanthemums and eagles, and there is no need to say anything about the waves.</p>
<p>Standing under the eaves in the wind, close to the faint fragrance, how can you ask about the honey room when the goods are extinct? When I get old, I miss Wen Daizhao, and falsely inscribe it as Wang Lantang.</p>
<h3>The Failure of Confucianism</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Mozi said: "Justice is righteousness, it must follow the superior to correct the inferior, and there is no following the inferior to correct the superior." Although this is Mozi's words, it is quite sufficient to represent the paradoxical political view of most Chinese scholars and officials in the past. Its paradox lies in: the superior correcting the inferior must rely on a wise ruler, but a wise ruler can be encountered but not sought. If the inferior must rely on a wise ruler to correct them, then if there is no wise ruler for a hundred years, the inferior will have to be uncorrected for a hundred years, and if there is no wise ruler for a thousand years, the inferior will have to be uncorrected for a thousand years. This is precisely why our country has always been uncorrected for thousands of years. Moreover, according to history, there are few examples of the superior being able to correct the inferior. Naturally, there are many examples of later generations correcting the previous dynasties, but when later generations are the "superior," their unrighteousness is still the same. This is probably due to the inferior not correcting the superior.</p>
<p>"Must follow the superior to correct the inferior" can be said in simpler terms, that is, the hope of ignorant villagers for a "true Son of Heaven." The people of Western democratic countries do not vainly hope that the "superior will correct the inferior" from the beginning, but the reason why the superior has to be corrected is because the inferior can correct the superior, and correct them at all times.</p>
<p>But considering that we have talked about European and American political thought for thirty or forty years, in fact, we have not achieved any results to date. Is the period too short? Then we have talked about Confucian political views for two or three thousand years, but they have never been truly implemented. What is the reason?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the principles spoken by the ancient sages of our country are correct, but the methods they used are not correct. Therefore, Confucianism failed from the beginning. Confucius and Mencius both traveled around the various states for a long time, seeing this ruler for a while and talking to that king for a while, rushing about among the feudal lords, with no time to warm their seats. It cannot be said that they did not work hard to promote their own doctrines, but how much did they ever persuade to come out of it? In fact, this is the inevitable result of targeting the feudal lords as the object of persuasion. Is it possible to ask the feudal lords to give up their vested interests? Who would be willing?</p>
<p>The mistake of the sages of our country in the past dynasties was the fallacy of "must follow the superior to correct the inferior." Therefore, if the superior is unwilling to correct, even sages like Confucius and Mencius are helpless. In addition, they still do not know how to change their policies after failing, so they naturally have to retreat and write books to end it. At that time, if the two of them could recognize the object and imitate what the British have done in recent times, picking crowded places in the park every day and standing on soapboxes to give speeches to the public about their doctrines, using the time and energy of persuading the feudal lords in this area, then the history of our country for the past two or three thousand years would definitely not be written like this. Thinking carefully, the effect of Confucius and Mencius persuading the feudal lords to save the world is really not as good as a short comedy program that radio stations have only broadcast for a week today. Isn't Xiao Kuai Le's opinion on raising tuition fees already attracting the attention of the citizens of the entire city?</p>
<p>Most of the people who promoted Western political thought in our country in modern times also made the same mistake as Confucius and Mencius. We only need to look back at the past articles on this kind of thing to know that although the content is imported, the tone is still in the style of memorials, full of hope that the "superior will correct the inferior." Most of them do not seem to be written for the people, so the people do not want to read them.</p>
<p>The author feels this way, so I am honest and unceremoniously change Mozi's words to "must follow the inferior to correct the superior, and there is no following the superior to correct the inferior."</p>
<h3>The Stingy Sir</h3>

<p>"Put out that lamp!" Sir Eaves, who owned half a million pounds, finally couldn't bear it anymore.</p>
<p>"But, uncle," his niece protested, "I need to wear that piece of clothing tomorrow! And, I bought the kerosene myself."</p>
<p>"I know, miss," the knight said unwillingly, "but I bought the wick that burns in that lamp!"</p>
<h3>East Scale, West Claw</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>The young students of Eton College in England have always been known for their aristocracy. The students' "hats" are all high-top top hats. Although the children's faces are still immature, these "top hats" are very spirited. However, recently, due to the conservation of materials, top hats have been difficult to buy, so the students of Eton have had to cancel these "top hats" from now on.</p>
<p>One of Sweden's laws stipulates that all employees of public and private institutions, banks, and stores in the country can rest for two weeks each year, with their salaries paid during the holidays. And news reporters and doctors are allowed to rest for a month, with their salaries paid. This law has been in effect for ten years.</p>
