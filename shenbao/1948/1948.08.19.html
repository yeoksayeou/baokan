<h3>動亂中的緬甸局勢</h3>
<p>緬甸自今年一月四日宣佈獨立以來，國內卽發生嚴重的黨爭，假使現任總理達欽努不够堅定，則共黨勢力的澎湃，恐早已席捲全緬了。緬共現於南北各地進行武裝叛亂，反抗政府，隸屬自由同盟的志願軍，亦譁變一部，竟於本月十四日，圍攻仰光。政府以排山倒海的陸空軍加以鎭壓，仰光之圍暫時解除，對外交通亦已恢復，現在政權可能獲得穩定。但全緬赤氛仍在擴大中，嚴重的形勢，並未削弱。合衆社仰光電訊，坦白指出：緬甸局勢遠較一般預料爲嚴重，政府除報以最強硬之手段，絕不能遏制共產叛軍，蓋叛軍中有最優秀之軍事人才，故緬甸內亂正方興未艾，未來的發展是値得深切注意的。</p>
<p>緬甸位於中南半島西部，西南濱孟加拉灣。全境分爲上緬甸與下緬甸兩部：上緬甸連接中國之雲南西康，正其國之東北面：下緬甸東倚暹羅，西接印度·緬甸山脈純爲中國橫斷山之餘脈，伊洛瓦底江純由康藏高地所發源。中緬關係素來密切，中緬大道穿過了橫斷山脈，所以緬甸的動靜，同中國是具有唇齒相依的關係。我們基於這種關係，重視緬甸今日的局勢；我們基於西南邊睡的安危，關切緬甸今日的動亂。今日緬甸的政變，不是偶然的，它是東南亞乃至全亞洲赤氛鑽進鐵幕的一環。我們應該指出緬甸動亂的癥結及其對亞洲大局的關係。</p>
<p>第一，緬甸今日的黨爭，從政黨的性質說，是自由同盟與共產黨之爭：從思想的分野說，是社會主義與共產主義之爭；從左右的對立說，是左翼與左翼之爭。這是緬甸政局動亂的癥結。緬甸執政黨現爲自由同盟，達欽努爲舉世注視的社會主義者，其思想較費邊主義還要透徹，其爲人一淸廉公正，多年來爲獨立自由而奮鬥，爲盎山將軍以後，唯一可以領導全國的人。今年五月廿五日，他宣佈左翼團結綱領十五條，其內容的革命性與進步性，實爲共產黨所不及。但他不顧同共黨合作，他宣佈緬共爲非法組織，他認在野黨不應擁有武力，否則便全部予以剿滅。英國對於達欽努的左翼，吃驚異常：蘇聯的與論亦瞠目以對，但達欽努仍堅定不拔，不惜在思想上政策上以及軍力上，與共黨一戰。這可見緬甸的黨爭，是二左之爭。</p>
<p>第二，緬共的叛亂，是與最近東南亞共產主義勢力配合發展的，它不是一支孤立的行動部隊，緬共力量的雄大，是値得重視的。緬共在工會擁有工人，不斷策動工潮：在學校擁有學生聯盟，不斷策動學潮。緬共從今年二月九日起，開始在緬北舉行武裝暴動，乘國家宣佈獨立不久，內政整理靑黄不接之際，從而控制了東瓜·巴生·薩加等地，直到仰光六十至八十哩的密支俄及普塔扎二地，最近更包圍仰光首都。緬共對傾向自由伺盟的志願軍，多方爭取，日來仰光的被圍，卽係部隊志願軍的譁變。緬共的力量，半年來逐漸發展，並且與馬來亞暹菲等地的共產勢力，取得密切的聯繫。緬文獨立派的荷衛報，七月七日著文反對暹報換使，該報引述暹羅蘇大使館有職員四十餘人，而暹羅蘇僑只有十人，並指出曼谷現變爲策動緬甸共黨騷亂的大本營。這些論調，雖不免過事舖張，碓緬共與東南亞共產勢力的同氣，則係顯明的事實。達欽努堅不與緬共妥協，正因爲他認淸緬共不是民族主義的政黨，不能與之空談民族國家的團結。</p>
<p>基於上述情勢看來，緬甸政局的發展是微妙的，是社會主義與共產主義之戰，出現於今日東南亞之一角。這與馬來亞·越南·印尼的情形，是逈然不同的。看大勢，緬政府决心要壓平共黨到底的，外交部長務丁圖已辭職從軍了，達欽努决向八月十六日的議會辭職，可能由副首相兼國防部長波力耶繼任。達欽努未來的道路是從軍，他决以精神感化的力量，眞理戰鬥的力量，壓迫共黨放下武力，實行軍隊國家化。達欽努的政治抱負，以及他奮鬥的目標，是爲「要共黨放棄武裝」這一原則而奮鬥。要之，緬甸變亂的發展，是關係亞洲前途很大的。但願達欽努把穩時代之舵，勇往直前奮鬥吧！</p>

<h3>匪諜製造學潮鐵證　（下）</h3>
<p>至於匪諜學生在政府區內製造學潮的破壞行動，與共匪的一切號召和要求，完全是密切呼應，若合符節的。譬如三十四年元旦毛澤東提出的十大任務，三十六年元旦朱德的廣播，以及三十六年十二月二十五日毛澤東在中共中央會議上的報告，都將所謂解放區與政府區相提並論，而特別强調對政府區進行廣泛的羣衆運動，提出所謂：「人民愛國民主運動」或「求生鬥爭」的欺騙口號，而匪諜學生所製造的各種學潮，與在歷次學潮中所　出的各種口號，又是完全配合驚共匪這兩大號召的要求。如；「反飢餓運動」，「吃光運動」，「反內戰運動」，「抗暴運動」等更是顯著的例證。其實共匪之提出這兩大欺騙口號，是用以瓦解政府後方的一種策略攻勢，在匪區殘暴的統治與其對共產國際一步一趨的附席政策下，所謂「人民愛國民主運動」或「求生鬥爭」不啻是一種强烈的諷刺。然而受共匪所絭養的匪諜學生，却利用政府的寬大與優容，在政府區域毫無忌憚地製浩種種學潮，來響應共匪這種惡毒的陰謀，有時且把一種出發於所謂「求生鬥爭」的運動中途變質，譬如去年五月，共匪職業學生所發動的「反飢餅運動」，便變質爲「反征兵」，「反征糧」，「反內戰」的叛亂運動，這不是儼然以共匪軍事間諜及城市工作者自居；而公然在政府後方開闢所謂「第二戰塲？</p>
<p>尤有進者，匪諜學生得以公然無忌控制各學校學生團體及制壓大多數善良學生後，便公然把神聖尊嚴的堂堂學府，變爲包庇奸匪的非法租界，並得以學校爲向外開展「城工活動」的中心。於是在這蘇維埃式的學校租界裏，便公然私設「法庭」「公審」善良學生，監視師長言行，建立「保衛聯盟」，以至誘騙靑年逃入匪區供匪　策，把學校當成共匪的招募機構。</p>
<p>二·匪諜學生怎樣制造學潮</p>
<p>在匪諜學生好話說盡壞事做盡的陰謀製造下，近年來大規模的學潮是此伏彼起，層出不窮，其中規模最大而陰謀最深的當推以下各次學潮。</p>
<p>（一）藉口反內戰製造昆明「一二一」事件：三十四年十一月底，昆明匪諜學生藉反內戰爲名，煽動各大中學罷課，幸賴大多數學生洞燭陰謀，組織反罷課委員會，嚴正反對，各已罷課學校因而紛紛復課。匪諜學生見陰謀不售，不惜以强暴手段進行搗亂，正當聯大同學否集會議商討反　課事宜時，職業學生所組織之突擊隊衝入會場動手毆打，破壞會議進行，並使用武器，相繼闖入各校，強迫教員學生罷課。但十一月卅日聯大匪諜學生在校內公開集會脅迫同學罷課時，値昆明第二軍官總隊學員按預定時間參觀大觀樓，列隊經過該校，該校匪諜學生竟發動以泥塊磚瓦襲擊該隊，雜以叫囂辱駡，該隊初則依　而避，繼則走避不及，遂起互毆，該隊以無端受辱，經書面質詢，未得反應，逐於十二月一日集體往聯大師範學院質詢，正相待間，一爲奸匪所收買之失業軍人陳奇達闖入向該院投擲手榴彈，製造慘案，而該校文學院內，亦同時向宮官隊擲出手榴彈，傷宮官隊隊員，慘案發生後，昆市匪諜學生即利用真相不明之時，嫁禍政府，謂係利用特務慘殺學生，發動全市各校總罷課，後由政府將兇手正法，治安當局撤職後，匪諜學生藉此製造全國性學潮的陰謀始未得售。但此一事件揭開了匪諜學生搗亂學校破壞教育的序幕。</p>
<p>（二）利用「沈崇事件」製造反美運動：三十五年十二月二十四日晚北大先修班學生沈崇女士，被美陸戰隊伍長皮爾遜姦污，這事件為皮爾遜個人之違法行動，政府與人民均同聲憤慨，北平行轅且向美軍當局提出嚴重備忘錄，要求嚴懲淫犯，這本是單純的法律問題，無須與外交政治混爲　談，但各地匪諜學生都視此爲破壞中美邦交的大好機會，積極策動各地展開空前巨大的反美運動。首先發動北大等入校於三十日罷課遊行，强調，「美軍應立即撤出中國。」至一月上旬，上海，南京，重慶，昆明，武漢，廣州，杭州等地匪諜學生都先後策動了相同的罷課遊行，其行動與口號各地完全一致，並藉此組成爲匪作倀的「全國學生抗暴聯合會」。</p>
<p>（三）發起「吃光運動」，製造「五·二〇」事件：「五·二〇」事件根源於共匪五朋學潮中「一校一事運動」的陰謀醞釀，於是在同時其中，相繼爆發了英士大學的遷校問題，交通大學的併系問題，滬江大學反積點制度，東方語專易長設院問題，中正大學易長遷校問題，及暨南中央金陵等校的公費問題，自五月中旬，南京以中大爲首即醞釀着節外生枝的「公費運動」，發動所謂「吃光運動」。一五·二〇」以中大金大為首，匪諜學生們脅持了一部份學生，並糾集了英大，社敎院及滬杭兩地來京的所謂學生代表們，大規模結隊遊行。並不聽治安當局的勸告及維持治安的徒手警察的善意勸阻，百般侮辱治安人員，並圖以暴力衝破警察的警備綫陣容，與徒手警察發生衝突，互有毆傷，而匪諜學生遂擴大宣傳為所謂「五·二〇」血案，　以此掀起全面學潮，幸其陰謀爲全國學生所洞燭，尙未使事件擴大。（下文轉入第五版）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十八日廣播：馬歇爾在記者招待會中稱，多瑙河會議美英法奧四國代表拒絕簽署蘇聯擬訂之多瑙河公約。美政府已訓令美代表凱農不予簽署該公約，並謂其他三國代表亦抱同樣態度。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社貝爾格勒十八日電〕英出席多瑙河會議代表團長貝克在表決新多瑙河條約前，宣佈英國認爲一九二一年之多瑙河條約仍繼續有效，不能承認新條約中特別賦予沿多瑙河某數國家事有多瑙河航行之獨佔權利。又稱，比利時希臘及義大利政府曾要求英政府通知大會，皆保留有關多瑙河權利。美代表凱農　英代表發言稱，「吾人引以爲遺憾者，即吾人不能保障多瑙河之自由航行是也。如無此保障，吾人自不能接受呈諸吾人之前之新條約。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒十八日電〕法代表莘艾利今晨在表決新多瑙河條約前，發表演說稱，予代表法政府宣吿法國不能接受七月卅一日開始之多瑙河會議所草成之條約。又稱，法國亦不願參加表決。同時蘇聯代表維辛斯基則宣佈蘇聯自動放棄條聯在多瑙河委員中之兩票投票權，因蘇聯將兼代表烏克蘭之故也。</p>
<h3>傳莫洛托夫提出新要求　蘇京談判陷僵局　三使節奉訓令繼續折衝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十八日廣播：英美法三國政府十八日以新訓令送達莫斯科三使節，準備下一次之克林姆宮會晤。官方拒絕透電下次會議是否再與莫洛托夫會晤，抑同時與莫氏及史達林會晤，外交界人士以爲除非雙方已有互相一致之具體迹象，目前之談判不能賡續多時。截至目前為止，開於會議之消息無一可以樂觀者。三國使節刻疋考慮與史達林作最後一式之會晤。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕外間謠傳莫洛托夫最近與西方三强專使會談時，曾提出重要建議，英外交部對於此說旣不予以證實，亦不予以否認。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕英專使羅伯茲之報吿傳抵此間後，政治界與外交界人士皆表露悲觀。所不解者各晚報今晚皆以大字標題，宣佈西方三强已接受展緩組織西德政府之原則，而以蘇聯取銷柏林封鎖爲條件。惟消息靈通之觀察家則稱，莫斯科已成立任何妥協之說，殊爲可疑。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林十八日電〕據悉如莫斯科會談失敗，則西方國家已備有一套對德之通盤計劃。外交方面指出，目前在克林姆宮進行之會談，已因蘇聯提出西方國家不能接受之要求而陷入困境。彼等稱，除非蘇聯立即收回要求，則柏林危機仍將回復至商談以前之形勢，蘇聯之封鎖將至於最惡劣之境地。如一旦此種形勢出現，西方國家第一步將集中加强對柏林之空運，第二步將加速建立西德政府，而使蘇聯獨自實施對其佔領區之策略。此種關於柏林之新計劃正在擬訂之揣測，係於十七日傳出，蓋是日西方國家司令官曾舉行會議，討論之結果並未發表。據來自德西南部華爾杜夫之消息，美法軍隊一千人以上，正從事戰鬥演習</p>

<p>〔合衆社普拉格十七日電〕捷克貿易代表團今日在國外貿易部長格萊高領導下，離此飛赴莫斯科。格氏將與蘇談判去年所訂協定內之一九四九年交貨限額，渠幷將討論「迄今所發生之貿易問題」。</p>

<p>按郁氏在南軍中之地位，僅次於狄托元帥一人。（倫敦南流亡人士稱，郁氏之逃往羅馬尼亞，恐係就任「自由南軍」總司令之職，支持共產情報局傾覆狄托之運動。又稱，該局刻意設置一南國傀儡政府以反對狄托。戰爭期間，狄郁兩人水乳交融，而一年來郁氏已被狄托逐出內圈。）內政部公報又稱，與郁氏偕行之兩人，達契維志上校已逃入羅境，而彼特烈契維志少將則在距邊境數碼處被捕。同行者尙有政府邊境產業局長阿拉貝巴克亦被擊斃。公報稱：阿氏受三人之紿代爲引路而「不知彼等圖非法入羅馬尼亞。」據被捕少將之供詞，三人早已商定出亡，乃詭言出獵野豬而赴邊境。其時一哨兵見有三人怱促趨往邊境，其時一人突向哨兵開槍，哨兵爲自衛起見，立即還槍，當塲格斃兩人，另兩人則逃往交界處。」公報對三人逃亡之理由未有解釋。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十八日廣播捷京訊：共黨報紙十八日公布南斯拉夫大使館攻擊狄托及南共之公開函，該函據稱係由南斯拉夫大使館中職員十一人所簽署，指責狄托政府「企圖分裂民主聯合陣綫」。</p>

<h3>李承晚對記者宣布韓將要求蘇承認　韓局勢不穩英表示暫不承認</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城十八日電〕南韓總統李承晚氏昨日會對記者表示，月前中·美·英·三大國已先後表示事實上承認大韓共和國政府，惟蘇聯方面尙無任何表示，以韓國之立塲言，必須中·美·英·蘇·四國共同扶植，始能究成新韓國之獨立建設，今後韓國政府仍將努力與蘇聯方面交涉，請求採取與中·美·英·三國一致之態度。又韓國政府現正準備一切資料，以備將來向日本提出賠償之要求。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕權成方面稱，英國在目前不承認南韓李承晚政府，並無政治意義。英國政府願先待聯合國大會通過聯合國朝鮮特別調査委員會之報吿後，再考慮是否承認朝鮮政府問題。又據消息靈通方面稱：英國對南韓政府所以採取目前之態度，乃由於英國領事館及其他方面之報吿，均謂南韓局勢頗不穩定之故。各報告均指出南韓在動盪中，農民·學生與若干智識份子，紛紛反對李承晚之「法西斯獨裁」。此外南韓有政黨四百餘，似亦爲混亂之象徵。若干報告更指出此次選舉乃在恐怖與欺詐中完成者。最後關於北韓蘇聯佔區之情况雖不明曉，然此間所獲之各種報吿，指出目前有少數朝鮮人民自南韓逃往北韓。</p>
<h3>美對韓貸款明年可達一億元</h3>
<p>李承晚電謝美承認韓國　〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕據最可靠方面透露，高級官員現正集議討論，是否國務部或經濟合作總署，將接管援韓計劃之行政及尙未動用之基金。政府方面估計，明年六月會計年度終了時，援韓計劃總數可達一億元之鉅。此數係根據屆時陸軍部於一億三千美元佔領區費用內分配與韓國之基金中，可能剩餘之數目之估計。權威方面認爲韓國大概將歸入援華計劃中。</p>

<p>渠復稱，新間諜組織與前共黨班特萊小姐與强伯斯二人所宣誓供述在戰前與戰爭期中滲入政府內部之兩間諜組織完全不同。湯麥斯吿記者稱，「全部事實現封存於政府檔案之中，杜魯門應說明渠爲何認爲應對人民隱瞞此種情報」。</p>
<h3>美間諜嫌疑人物惠特突病逝</h3>

<h3>史達林與狄托的鬥爭（中）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯　（原文載七月九日「美國新聞與世界報告」誌）</p>
<p>存在於衛星國家間的民族仇視心理，有的是根深蒂固的，漸漸削弱了蘇聯欲使東方向西方誇示的堅强的陣容。領土的爭執離間了波蘭人和捷克人，離間了南斯拉夫人和保加利亞人，更離間了義奧共產黨和南斯拉夫人。波蘭人，捷克人和南斯拉夫人需要一個弱小的德國，可是德國共產黨在莫斯枓支持下，要求一個强盛的德國。</p>
<p>這些民族主義的，政治的，和經濟的壓迫一天加重一天，蘇聯在第二次世界大戰中所得到的最大收獲，即莫斯科對其東歐新安全地帶的控制，將遭遇日趨嚴重的困難。南斯拉夫目前的背叛，也許日後會促成其他地方的騷動。</p>
<p>狄托的行動已經戳穿了克林姆鐵壁銅牆的紙老虎。即使把南斯拉夫的漏洞彌補了，蘇聯集團也許不會再像去年那樣堅强團結，足以和西方抗衡了。把南斯拉夫的內幕眞相揭露出來，便可以明瞭蘇聯爲什麼和它的集團發生糾紛。南斯拉夫危機在六個月以前便已開始存在。去冬經濟恐慌襲擊南斯拉夫，五年計劃的推進受到了阻礙。農民所生產的糧食不敷需求，配給消費者的物資被轉移到黑市塲中去；生產量較預定計劃落後。蘇聯至今還不能供給南國以實行工業化所必需的機器。</p>
<p>南國共產黨對於解决上述種種題題應採的策略，發生了內部意見的紛歧。在狄托的七人政治局中，二人的領導下產生了一個分裂的黨派。這兩人在第二次世界大戰時，都曾和狄托元帥駢肩從事游擊抗戰。一位是海勃朗，現任國家計劃委員會主席，這是南國最高的經濟職位。另一位是財佐傑維契，曾在狄托元帥麾下担任游學隊副司令。除了狄托以外，佐氏是南斯拉夫最孚衆望的一個領袖，他同時也是蘇聯外長莫洛托夫的好朋友。</p>
<p>這兩個分裂份子慫恿狄托加速實施集體農塲制及零售業和小工業之國營。狄托的黨徒們拒絕這些建議，堅持農業必須逐漸實行社會主義化，同時大規模的工業旣已實行國營，不必急急於接收小工廠和零售業</p>
<p>蘇聯的間接干涉</p>
<p>干久以後，蘇聯便出來間接干涉這件爭端。南國秘密警察發見　據：蘇聯的特務人員正在招募共產黨員擔任間諜，並慫恿其他黨員擁護佐氏和海氏的黨派。南國的保安警察OZMA對蘇聯官員加緊監視。</p>
<p>狄托集團裘的份子開始指資蘇聯不能供給經濟援助，同時對其它的蘇聯政策多所抨擊，並且有建議以貿易及貸款方式向西方列强請求援助。</p>
<p>然而經濟問題不久便被「莫斯科統治抑貝爾格勒統治」的問題所冲淡了。</p>
<p>反對派領袖雖有莫斯科給他們撐腰，終於被迫停止其反對的論調。一月間經濟權成海勃朗被貶黜爲工業部長，但是佐傑維契却升任中將要職，恐怕是爲了要得到他的支持的緣故</p>
<p>三月二十日蘇聯直接對狄托派施用壓力。蘇聯共黨中央委員會致函南斯拉夫中央委員會，措詞嚴厲，並擁護佐氏和海氏的黨派。該函指責狄托箝制黨內言論，同時匈牙利·波蘭·捷克·羅馬尼亞和保加利亞的共黨在蘇聯的指使下，紛紛致函狄托作同樣的責難。</p>

<h3>公用事業公開調審會成立　定期先審電力部份　通知各公司造送收支表等資料備查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市公用事業公開關査審議委員會，於昨午三時在市府會議室舉行成立會，出席吳市長，參議會姜豪·江浩然·瞿鉞·李文杰·邵永生。公用局趙曾珏，社會局張處德，市商會嚴　聲，會計師公會何元明，總工會葉翔臯，市工業協會田和卿，工程師學會尤巽照等九單位代表十三人。（電機工程師學會潘銘新未到）。列席者有市府秘書長沈宗濂，參議會秘書長項昌權，市府參事林篤信等。由吳市長主席，首先闡明成立公開調査審議委員會之意義與任務，渠稱：各界對公用事業公司之收支情形，及市府與公司間之關係，頗多懷疑。本人當建議參議會籌組審議委員會後，經參議會議決由市府負責組織，本人認爲今日所急需討論之問題有二：（一）應如何調査審議始屬相宜。（二）採用何種公開審議方式。</p>
<p>李文杰提出可供調査之資料，計分二部份：（一）現成可用者，如公用局及參議會之公用事業調査報吿書，經濟部條正之公用事業價格計算方式說明書，參議會臨時大會決議案，及八月份公用事業價格調査說明等。（二）待收集者：各公司本年一月至六月之收支表，及公司所定基數如何求得之根據報吿等。李氏認爲審議委員會之工作甚爲艱鉅，且應顧及時間之限制，全部審議工作，本月底前須得結果。渠主張將交通工具，電話，電力，煤氣，自來水等各部門，應予分別審議，審議時應邀各公司之財務，工務，會計等負責人參加說明。估計全部工作完畢，尙須舉行審議委員會十次以上。</p>
<p>各公司困難　當助其解決</p>
<p>趙局長表示同意李氏之意見，各項公用事業應予分別審議，因本市計有電力公司六家，自來水公司五家，電話公司二家，電車公司二家，公共汽車公司二家，煤氣公司二家，市輪渡及小火車公司各一家，機構頗爲繁複，審議當亦費時。渠認爲在目前戡亂期間，公用事業之當前政策，應以維特其不停不斷爲前提。對各公司之能度應爲：凡公司有困難者，凡力之所及，當予以協助解決，無法解決時，亦須有充分解釋，使其折服。趙局長表示，審議工作進行時，該局對公用事業公司各部門均有專職人員可供詢問。</p>

<h3>冷氣設備飛快車　監委會議猛烈抨擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕京滬路開駛冷氣設備飛快車一事，十八日監院交通委會首次會議中，曾予以猛烈抨擊，出席委員僉認交通事業，應以大衆福利爲前提，而目前國家財力枯竭，路局非惟不能撙節開支，反而標新立異，耗巨貲造冷氣火車，專供豪富之享受，其不合時宜，自不待言。政府貼補交通事業，亦僅可於萬不得已之情形下爲之，蓋交通事業本身，需儘量减削不必要之開支，如仍不敷，然後再由政府貼補。</p>
<h3>旅館業代表請願　增收水電附加費</h3>
<p>吳局長允俟提出討論</p>

<h3>公教配給煤球　五廠猶未售罄</h3>
<p>盼未領者速往購領</p>
<p>據燃管會息，本市公敎人員配給煤球總數約十一萬担，該會每月準備配給數量約十二萬担，故每月均有配餘，並無不數分配情事。惟因承配煤球廠分佈全市各區計五十家，中區各廠以地點適中，購求較多，故每次較早售罄，西南區各廠因往領者少，恒有剩餘，茲將本期尙未售完各廠地址探明錄後，俾未領者速往購領，以免逾期致遭損失，計開：信孚，歸化路一〇三〇號。越東，宜昌路三〇〇弄六一號。興華，南市外馬路一四一〇號。源華，安遠路A二五號。北洋，安遠路一三〇二號。</p>

<p>招商局海杭輪，十七日下午七時由汕頭抵滬，停泊招商局第五碼頭，海關檢査人員在八時上輪檢査旅客行李時，曾在旅客黄北平所帶之綱籃夾底內抄出雅片八塊，計重一·四四公斤。又在黄如榮，鄭永二人所帶之鮮芋艿及瓦罐鹵味內，抄出雅片十二塊，計重二·三五公斤。後二人所運之雅片，係代人携帶，每兩僅取手續費五十萬元。海關詢其以此區區之手續費，竟甘冒此大險，其故何在。黄鄭二人聞後，頗爲懊喪，請求海關方面姑念無知，從輕發落。另一黄北平所運之雅片，據供內州卅二兩係爲已有，餘係代人携帶，希運滬轉售。現該二案人犯及烟毒，業由海關移送警察局法辦。</p>

<h3>陳虁龍遺體定今日大殮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕遜淸遺老陳虁龍氏逝世消息，已見昨日本報。陳氏爲丙戌進士，曾任遜朝兵部主事總理衙門章京，洊升至兵部員外郞中，擢內閣侍讀學士順天府府丞府尹，時正庚子拳亂，留守京師，隨同李鴻章出與各國議和，因功外濯河南布政使，未赴任，即升漕運總督，調河南巡撫·江蘇巡撫·四川總督·湖廣總督，最後任北洋大臣直隷總督。辛亥革命發生之前，先期乞退，以印緩直隷臨運使張鎭芳代理，不數日而淸帝遜位詔下矣。嗣後退居滬上，以詩書自遺，凡三十餘年。八十歲前，時作蘇杭魯燕之遊，輒紀以詩，故積稿數十册，已刋行者有松壽堂詩稿，花近樓詩稿，鳴原集等數編。陳氏今年已達九二高齡，爲遜朝遺老中齒爵俱尊之一人，北方王克敏等，均其門人弟子，惟陳氏大節凛然，淪陷期內與敵僞絕不往還，故抗戰勝利主席首次蒞滬視察時，曾親赴陳宅，面加慰問。此次以微疾捐館，門生故舊，同聲悼痛，蓋其謙和盛德，感人甚深也。陳氏遺體已定今日下午三時在江陰路一五七號本宅大殮，附圖爲陳氏遺影今春由攝影家郞靜山所攝者。</p>

<h3>三百年來第一次　各路英雄聚首一堂　天蟾舞臺國術大會　跌撲翻騰身手不凡</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕這幾天，每天下午在天蟾舞台有國術比賽表演大會，是中央國術館東北分館爲提倡國術而主辦，從十六日開幕，到二十一日爲止。昨天已經是表演第三天了。</p>
<p>大會的主持人是中央國術館東北分館館長陸軍中將李大恒，贊助人有生敎于斌，中央國術館館長張之江，豫籍立委張鈁。參加全國二十一國術技擊團體。據說像這樣「各路英雄聚會一堂」的局面，自滿淸三百年以來，這還是第一次。</p>
<p>昨天表演的單位有華社。華聯·精武·羣英·豫中等五個國術社。表演的節目有各種拳術與各種兵器，表演的性質有單人·雙打·及以一敵二。兵器種類除刀鎗劍戟之外，有月牙鏟，行者棒，九節鞭等，武技名月有工力拳。華奉。單刀戰鎗，燕靑醉酒，二龍戯珠等，可說是琳瑯滿目，洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>白髪蒼蒼鏢師　拳終面不改色</p>
<p>外行人對於技藝的高下與功夫的高低實在難以判別，觀衆的喝采，大都鄭中於殺搏有勁的塲面，每逢台上兵器鏗鏘，吆喝有聲，台面蹦蹦作響，塵灰飛揚之時，台下就采聲四起，但這時候台上幾位評判的「行家」却未必示嘉許之色。按說武功的好壞，要看脚是否站得穩？出手是否敏捷有力？雙目是否有神？這三者如果缺一，功夫就還沒有到家。</p>
<p>節目中有一位年近七旬白髪蒼蒼的老者表演，他在合上跌撲翻騰，身手不凡，一套拳打究後，面不改色。此老據說是華聯國術社的領導蔡桂勤，年靑時曾爲鏢師，揚威名於晋陝甘肅等省綠林道上。他如此高壽而居然還如此健壯，可見國術對於强身延壽的功效。</p>
<p>六歲孩童表演　居然功架畢具</p>
<p>與這位老鏢師媲美的却是豫中國術社一個六歲的小孩子。他身長恐怕還不滿兩呎，表演起來，却是功架畢具。一套猴拳，一套醉拳，非但神情畢肖，而且頭頭是道，幾個頭不着地的觔斗，更翻得淸脆爽利。這小孩子從這麼小年紀練起，到大來其功夫眞不可限量。</p>
<p>武功一道，有少林·武當·崑崙·峨嵋·天山·索倫·關東各派之分。記得小時候看武俠小說，對於其中描寫的英雄豪傑，劍仙俠客之流，像着迷一般的私心響往。等到年齡長大，智識漸增，才明白這一個時代早已過去，槍砲炸彈已取拳頭刀戟而代之。可是作爲一種健身强種的運動，國術本身還是有其價値。</p>
<p>如要強身強國　必須提倡國術</p>
<p>據大會主特人李中將談·國術一道，講究運氣，要把身體內部的毛病先補足後才能練功夫，這是國術勝於西洋運動之處，因爲西洋運動僅求肌肉發達而已。他說在淸朝以前，國人對於武技甚爲注意，那時候體格遠比現在高大强壯，平均壽命亦遠較現時爲長，可惜自滿淸入主後，因別有用心，重文輕武，於是國術淪亡，國人體格就日益衰弱，他認爲要强身强國，必須提倡國術。</p>
<p>李中將本人練氣功已很到家，昨天他練給記者看，一股氣運到腹部，隆起來像打足氣的足球一般。國術比賽大會，今天的節目中，他將親自表演一番，還有在全國運動會中担任國術裁判的佟忠義，他今天亦將在台上一獻身手。</p>

<h3>被檢舉漢奸罪嫌之富商　鄧仲和招待記者　對萬里浪致渠之函件認為偽造　市長鄭重聲明控案與特捐無關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國民黨市黨部農工委員會委員朱政文，向高檢處檢舉本市富商鄧仲和漢奸罪嫌案，除由司法機關正進行偵察外，日來雙方在各報刊登啓事，互有聲明。先是鄧仲和指稱朱政文爲「恐嚇匪」，因第二次曾向渠敲詐未遂，僞造文書，挾嫌誣吿其爲漢奸；朱政文乃於昨日刊登啓事，謂渠檢舉鄧仲和漢奸，搜有各種確切證據，對鄧稱渠爲「恐嚇匪」，係含血噴人，誹謗中傷，已構成刑事罪責，依法另行訴究。鄧仲和見報，今日復在各報刊登啓事，駁覆朱政文之啓事，稱爲「全係信口雌黄，極盡村婦駡街之能事」。鄧並於昨日公開招待記者，就此事件及救濟特捐問題有所報告，除指朱曾兩次敲詐外，並稱：朱控渠漢奸之理由，係憑已槍斃之萬里浪致渠函一件，大意謂渠在敵僞時期，曾贈送萬里浪軍用毯五萬條，及贈送登部隊軍用毯十五萬條，可以得到棉花統制權等語。而此信函，渠認爲係出僞造。</p>
<p>關於救濟特捐部份，據鄧稱，渠所經營之安樂紡織廠，除已由毛紡棉紡及染織三公會，於上月杪轉繳三次外，本月四日與吳市長晤面時，又認捐五百億，至於市畏所示余之萬里浪書信照片一紙，諒亦係朱所投遞，其目的在惡意宣傳。</p>
<h3>勸募會進行　調查鄧仲和財產</h3>
<p>記者昨訪吳市長，詢問鄧仲和勸募救濟特捐情形。吳市長答稱：迄今尙無結果。市長與鄧仲和數度談判後，鄧氏僅允認捐五百億元，此數與勸募委員會所提出之目標距離懸殊，故委會決不接受。現勸募委員會已着手進行調査鄧之財產。</p>
<h3>市長承認出示照片</h3>
<p>關於外傳鄧仲和被控漢奸與救濟特捐有關一節，吳市長已予鄭重否認，渠稱：鄧仲和被控後曾接朱政文一函，歷述鄧之漢奸劣跡，惟渠從不知有朱政文其人。且鄧被控甚早，法院早已暗中加以偵査。至於吳市畏曾向鄧仲和出示萬里浪書信照片事，吳氏稱：照片係某委員轉來，且渠迭接各方檢舉鄧仲和之情報，認爲鄧旣有發國難財嫌疑，則正與中央所訂之特捐勸募標準符合，向其出示照片，勸導自動認捐。</p>
<p>記者復詢以救濟特捐之進展情形，渠稱：目前正在進行者均爲素來懢客之豪富，深信此關打破後，其他問題均可迎刃而解。</p>

<h3>匪諜製造學潮鐵證　上接二版</h3>
<p>（四）煽動「六二」學潮，製造「三罷一慘」未遂：正當各地學生逐漸憬悟，愛國護校運動相繼展開，迫使匪諜學生的陰謀轉趨消沉之際，共匪「中央靑年部」大感恐慌，遂密令各校匪諜學生加强製造突擊性的學潮，而岡發動所謂「三罷一慘運動」，並預定以共匪「反戰日」即六月二日爲谷地學生總罷課示威遊行的總發動日，由各地學聯齊集南京之匪諜學生代表議決後，分別通知各地學校匪諜學生全力推動「六，二一總罷課遊行，幸各地治安當局鄭重宣示嚴密防止的決心及各種合理的疏導，迫使各地匪諜學生不得不相繼放棄「六，二」的「三罷一慘」的企圖，當天各地反而顯得特別平靜。</p>
<p>（五）于子三自殺案的陰謀製造：十月二十三日上海郵電當局發現浙大農藝糸三年級學生黄賢林自滬寄給浙大自治會主任于子三的信中，說明奉于派到滬參和共匪學聯，並向于報吿上級派黄世民陳建新到杭指導醖釀「反動員令」及爭取各校學生自治會工作，要于於廿五日赴車站迎接，於是治安當局遂預先佈置在旅館內同時捕獲于黄陳等及另一讀書會負責人酈伯瑾。當塲並搜獲共匪書籍文件及名單以及其他秘密文件多種，由治安當局轉送法院究辦，不料于犯畏罪，且圖嫁禍政府，乘看守人員疏於防範，割喉自殺。於是在浙大匪諜學生的鼓動下成立了「治喪」「營救」「控訴」等委員會，醞釀大規模的發動學潮，而北平的淸華，北大等校受匪諜煽動的學生，也罷課響應，幸賴于犯自殺的事實公開證明，且當局疏導得力，雖然出殯時一度惹起風波，尙未釀成巨大事變。</p>
<p>（六）蓄意發動的「五，二一」事件：南京中大的匪諜學生，本企圖在「五四」紀念日造成「事件」，結果因羣衆基礎不够未達目的，接着在「五，二〇」預定的晚會，又爲大中學生聯誼會所阻，於是遂改移「五，二一」晚上舉行，在這一晚會上其所表演節目，極盡某侮辱元首詆毀政府的能事，致爲一部份激於義憤的學生所不滿，而嚴重抗議，不料匪諜學生所組織的武裝糾察，竟毆辱觀衆私刑拷打四中同學李治民與倪郁文，致晚會後兩個金大匪諜學生，被憤懣不平的觀衆扯送衛戍總部，不料錯送靑年部，而由靑年部拒絕接收，改送警廳轉解衛戍總部，嗣由金大訓導長當晚領回，而匪諜學生遂以此爲藉口，於五月廿二日罷課一天，舉行遊行示威，並包圍靑年部提出無理要求，在靑年部門牆上亂塗各種極盡侮辱汚蔑的口號與標語，終由於靑年部陳部長的鎭靜處理，未肇事端，但匪諜學生的猖獗與其無法無天的搗亂行動，於此可見一般。</p>
<p>三·最近共匪的學運陰謀及其暑假工作</p>
<p>共匪爲配合軍事叛亂之擴大，岡使學潮成爲城市擾亂之核心，與以學校爲租界培養叛亂幹部，誘脅至農村從事武裝暴動，本年度共匪學運之基本任務，依據所破獲共匪對匪諜學生指示文件中所載，其總方針爲「從基本上迅速而有利地動搖及摧毀反動派的統治」，該項文件中提出匪本年度學運之基本策略共有五項：</p>
<p>（一）學運中的舊形式，必須予以揚棄，要靈活地運用一切可能及有利條件。</p>
<p>（二）着重宣傳敎育效果避免無謂犧牲。</p>
<p>（三）打擊妥協主義失敗主義，糾正盲動主義。</p>
<p>（四）加强全市全國的聯繫，免被各個擊破。</p>
<p>（五）隨時準備出擊，不以小勝爲滿足。</p>
<p>故其基本學運方案之制訂，列有從搞好功課開始和同學生活在一起，由淺入深，由近而遠，由小而大，由低而高，校內和校外，加緊努力，迎接新高潮等項。</p>
<p>由校內和校外項目所規定的工作重心爲：</p>
<p>「學生工作重心應放在校內，而鬥爭的發展及目的則應推到校外到人民羣衆的海洋，在校中應逐漸提高同學覺悟性，緊密團結同學的力置，在工作中培養幹部，鍜鍊幹部，把基礎打得更深更鞏固，以建立學運的中心堡壘，然後逐漸推而廣之，源源地把大批幹部輸送到校外去，支持其他落後部門的工作，毅然走入人民的海洋和革命主力軍，工農結合起來，爭取人民的解放，完成光榮的歷史任務，但輸送並不是拔根，並不是只要求材而不樹苗，而是在大量培養中有計劃的輸送，加緊培養源源輸送，以維持學運發展的平衡性」。</p>
<p>又其在加緊努力迎接新高潮項目中的中心工作爲：</p>
<p>「革命歷史證明了偉大的工程師作家科學家政治家，大部份是由最尖銳最劇烈的鬥爭塲所來鍛鍊的，而不是脫離實際鬥爭的溫室所能培栽出來的，所以我們除了應該經常進行時事學習，傳佈解放軍大反攻後的局勢，人民疾苦與獨裁者的危機，解放區人民的幸福生活，解放軍的具體政策，愛國民主運動展開情形，民主新中國的遠景等外，尤須努力學習關於農村農民的知識，學就爲農民服務和組織農民鬥爭的本領，弄通思想，隨時準備到農村去，接受革命的新高潮」。</p>
<p>足證共匪圖使學潮與其軍事叛亂打成一片，達到積極支援共匪破壞國家秩序屠殺無辜人民的陰謀。</p>
<p>在運用方式上，匪方的指示是：視客觀環境與主觀條件分別重輕，分採「非法鬥爭」與「合法鬥爭」種種形式，並爲執行其「每一次學潮，均爲下次學潮之鍜鍊，檢閱與準備」的策略，進行其「戰役」與「戰役」間的整補階段，醞釀所謂「基本上迅速而有利地動搖及摧毀反動派的統治」的「學運新高潮」，其在暑假工作中，表現了如下的形態：</p>
<p>暑假開始後，共匪僞「全國學聯」已暫停策動全國性的大規模的學潮，而轉入鞏圖整理策劃佈置待機再舉之階段，其原因：</p>
<p>（一）接受共匪華中分局之指示。</p>
<p>（二）學校休假，學生多數分散。</p>
<p>（四）四五六月份學潮中，幹部及組織過於暴露，急須調整。</p>
<p>按共匪華中局（活動範圍爲蘇北蘇南及皖省津浦路西地帶）最近會密發「現階段學運的新路向」指示一件，要點略謂：</p>
<p>「政府加緊鎭壓，學運已面臨更大之艱苦困難，必須糾正兩種偏向，（一）過左的傾向，仍繼續從事大規模之羣衆行動，未把握「有理有利貴帶的」原則，未佔計政府必然之打擊，而招致無謂的損失：（一）過右的傾向，一味隱蔽消極等待，惟困難固增加，如能正確估計客觀環境，充分把握黨的路綫，仍可克服，現階段學運之路向應是：（一）集中力量，有層次的打擊某一點，擴大統一國綫，縮小打擊面，以避免在運動中孤立，（二）鞏固已得陣地，分散作戰，由近而遠，由內而外，遂步開展，以長期苦幹之決心穩紥穩打之方法，一點一滴積蓄力量，準備力量，迎接高潮，（三）一切羣運，以生活鬥爭經濟鬥爭爲契機，等待時機成熟，即迅速轉爲政治鬥爭，及時提出反美帝反×統治口號。（四）將廣大靑年日常經濟利益，與長遠政治利益，互相配合，將「愛國民主」工作與日常生活結合，自集體解決生活問題與學習問題中建立羣衆關係與基礎」等語。</p>
<p>基於以上指示：僞「上海學聯」曾於七月初數度集會，決定其暑期工作方針如次：</p>
<p>（一）暫停大規模的行動，保全實力，整理並鞏固組織。</p>
<p>（二）由政治鬥爭，回至學生切身利益鬥爭（生活，經濟，學集）。</p>
<p>（三）分散深入社會與農村，從事調査，聯絡與宣傳以建立學運與社會運動配合之基礎。</p>
<p>以上三項，關係共匪「有步驟地有策略地」一語之應用。自組織之整補，鬥爭內容與方式之轉換，爲下學期新學潮埋植種子佈置力量。</p>
<p>關於學生之行動原則，及下學期學潮佈置工作，僞「學聯」曾提出三個口號：（一）「個別解放」（按指潛赴匪區），（二）「留校聯防」，（三）「集體返鄕」，後二項之各地活動所表現者是：（一）關於團結學生者：如辦理暑期補習學校，讀書會，打字訓練班，講習會，旅行團，調查畢業同學之就業情形與決定聯絡方式，辦理考生服務團……等。（二）關於整理組織者：暫停吸收新會員，加緊麻醉中學生，廣泛擴建新外圍團體（如辦理小記者訓練班），佈置本屆高中畢業之「學聯」會員，有計劃的分散投考各國立及私立大學，以爲下學期各大專學校之新幹部。共匪並已於偽「全國學聯」內部，建立一個支部，以加强控制操縱。（三）關於分散展開煽惑叛亂之社會活動者：如辦理識字班義務夜校，進行農村訪問，均乘機對市民及農民宣傳「反扶日，反抽丁，反徵實」，編演各種「活報」與歌詠。</p>
<p>四·共匪大量誘致青年學生潛赴匪區真象</p>
<p>由上可見共匪處心積慮，對下學期新學潮陰謀佈置之一斑。然必須特別重視者，厥爲本年暑期，各地匪諜學生大批潛往匪區之現象。其性質可分：（一）共匪調回受訓，準備再派回，（二）面目暴露，畏罪逃亡，（三）受共匪「歡迎參加解放區建設工作」口號之迷惑，被誘前往，（四）幻想於「革命武裝鬥爭」生活，被誘參加政府後方農村武裝暴動。</p>
<p>以上第（一）（四）兩項，各爲匪加强政府後方「城市工作」「農村工作」陰謀之一部，（二）（三）兩項則屬於「匪區工作」之陰謀，故共匪整個活動均在利用匪化靑年爲人力之來源，共匪「學運」基本目的之一，爲「從實際行動中以培養叛亂幹部」，最近職業學生潛入匪區之各種情况有可靠證據者如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於調訓幹部以加强「城市工作」者：匪黨內部，最近曾接獲僞中央之指示，飭「全國性大量開展城市工作，並抽籖大部份工作人員，到城工部學習後，分配去各地工作，……大家在敵人後方心臟煽動羣眾，爭取中間份子，做好地下工作，準備形勢到臨……」等語。故各地匪黨城工部浪近紛紛調集幹部訓練，包括學運幹部在內。上海方面大專學校共匪學生多率調藉「暑期遊覽」名義爲掩護，分天津靑島二地，再轉道潛赴匪區受訓，爲期約二月，一部份則赴香港受訓。洛陽淪陷時，被共匪俘去之中學生三百餘人，已在靈寳朱家關二地受匪訓練完畢，將全部派回政府後方關中一帶，藉學生身份掩護活動。西北各地秘密潛赴匪區之靑年學生，共匪特設立偽延安大學洛川分校收容訓練，並以「隨到隨考」爲號召，鄂西襄南地區共匪則設立僞「愛國民主幹部學校」，收訓靑年學生。粵籟閩邊區共匪亦正積極吸收中學生施以訓練，僞華中軍區九分區域工部之訓練班，股於偽如（畢）東（台）縣掘港海岸，調訓江南地區匪之間諜。</p>
<p>（二）關於畏罪逃亡匪區者，經先後發現者南京有中大畢業生華彬淸等（已被捕），企圖逃往巢縣匪區，上海有復且袁水竇於二月前逃返山東匪區，交大甘維垣亦已潛赴匪區，光華「學聯」分會幹事嚴廷昌則自動退學，逃返蘇北，北平方面前捕獲之匪間諜案北大學生鄧特等數人，爲特刑庭取保釋放後，一再拒傳，已逃往匪區。</p>
<p>（三）關於受匪煽惑，潛往參加匪區工作者：上海方面據共匪學生透露：匪華中軍區（蘇北）近擬在京滬二地招大專學生二千人入匪區工作，七月二日，交大發現已被開除之共匪學生張貼佈吿，煽誘同學前赴匪區，即爲一例。火夏大學於七月五日開除五十六名學生中，有三分之二，於七月下旬，分批離滬，或赴蘇北山東，或赴香港轉入粵境匪區參加叛亂，育才中學爲共匪在滬學運據點之一，本年著期該校一部份畢業生已被介往匪區。平津方面，共匪學生在各校發起所謂「冀東行運動，煽動長　被捕，「害怕考試之學生，前往蠶東匪區，已發現成行者有北平國立第一助產學校孫景黃偕其夫率全家前來，　縣開平中心小學敎師張文傑，屈治明，王振芳，趙會元，唐山豐　中學舉生于鴻業，北平市立女二中學生崔　華·李蟠等多人。又開封一度淪陷期中，河大共匪及民盟份子共七十九人逃赴豫西匪區，計有嵇文甫·王毅齊·李後甫等。香港方面民盟之達德學院六月五日校方正式對學生公佈，願援助修業期滿或經濟困難行將退學或志願赴「解放區」工作學生之辦法，規定如願赴奧桂閩，華南「解放區」及南洋工作者，可由校董會及新華社分別介紹。</p>
<p>（四）關於被誘參加所謂「農村工作」從事後方武裝暴動者；雲南剿匪部隊在大姚瀕勒，濾西，石屛，印北等綫共匪中，發現有前昆市學潮之領導人物在，如馬麗（女）舒守訓·蔣永尊等在內。雲南共匪部隊之有大批共匪學生敎員參加，最近匪華商報亦直承不諱。香港方面共匪高唱所謂：「知識份子到農村去」，亦從事暴動，爲時已久。最近且不斷發現小學生亦被誘拐赴匪區參加「小兒隊」（一名「小英雄」隊）訓練，業經港府及學生家長查明屬實，且已破獲多起。</p>
<p>由上可知，今日共匪加緊利用學校誘致學生，一方面在開展我方城市騷亂與農村暴動，一方面則在增厚匪區人力，培養叛亂幹部。共匪所謂「城市民主運動與農村武裝鬥爭相結合」，「匪區工作與政府區後方同時進展」，「自城市鬥爭中培養農村工作幹部」等原則，現已一一應用，於此益證現階段學潮的嚴重性已達到危害整個國家社會的安全，非澈底予以肅淸不可了。（全文完）</p>

<h3>輸管會審核非限額貨品　每日核準三萬美元　非限額處負責人發表審核情形</h3>
<p>輸管會對於進口貨「附表」（三甲）兩類貨品，規定申請許可輸入，惟數量視實際需要與外匯頭寸而定，頗有伸縮。且該會審核手續頗費時日，故各界對之頗多不滿。頃據該會非限額審核處負責人語記者：附表（一）（三甲）兩類貨品織入外匯數量，前經規定爲每日五萬美元，一月爲一百五十萬美元，但實際因積壓關係，平均每日僅核准三萬餘美元。七月份迄今爲止，一個半月之內，共核准一百二十五萬美元。</p>
<p>據該負負資人表示，此非該處手續緩慢所致，實有相當困難，至外傳該會核准一千萬美元生產器材等物資進口，實係美援之一部分，與該會經管之工作稍異。又據稱：該會過去接到自備外匯之申請案，共爲一百餘件，自僑資及國外資金輸入辦法公佈後，申請者已有數百件，惟目因因實施細則尙未經政院核定，故暫時未便處理云。</p>
<h3>人心猶豫不定　華股臨收恍惚</h3>
<p>華股昨猶豫之人心，加上不定之銀根，全日過程，異常忐忑。晨盤上塲即疲，開後每况愈下，後市開始反動，中途漲風戞然而止，臨收極爲恍惚，除水泥地產股漲停外，均勝榮辱互見。</p>
<p>最初人心即因種種經濟消息，咸屬不利，隔前誤以國行差出之存多，亦都失望，開出即屬低盤，永紗以一六八〇〇元登塲，一八〇號四號一四五號一六九號八九號一五七號六五號二〇三號即來供給，退至一六二三〇元，雖由四八號一一九號二二四號進至一六四五〇元，終以業外奇淡，雜股奄奄一息，而銀根見緊。七六號六五號八九號一五七號六一號一〇二號七一號了結，銀行帮二二〇號，廣帮一五五號二一八號亦售，除上泥永業反吿涨停外，每况愈下。近午塲外息價拎高爲二九元及三二元，跌至一六一二〇元低價，一四五號維持，午收一六二五〇元，除永業上泥漲停，信誼勤興統益永公商務微挫，火柴平平外，係均跌落半成至一成不等。</p>
<p>後市因午刻銀根已濫，永紗開高至一六八五〇元，雖曾由八九號二一八號二二八號二二五號等貨到一六七五〇元，但不久業外刺激紛起，七一號一三號一二號一三〇號一六八號三號二二六號六五號九九號均進，而漲到一七三三〇元高價。漲風至此憂然而止，除兩水泥股及一地產股尙屬漲停外，餘股仰高而回。國行之交換，傳說不一，人心亦仍屬猶豫，一三四號二二〇號五七號一六九號一七九號一九三號七六號一五三號賣到一六九八〇元，幾經掙扎，永紗收市仍屬一六九八〇元，收後以國行大差出，喊價稍高，較晨收除中泥永業漲停，信和動興統益大通內衣商務閘北漲半成，餘均小升。塲外各未上市股票，以大生文化銀行烟業公用股漲半成左右外，餘亦穩健有加。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨高檔被銀根所扼而難持久，甲乙見二〇〇萬，丙創二七〇萬，丁種二一六萬，戊種二二八萬，都屬新高峯。臨收小回，但仍軋漲不少，五五二室出，五〇〇室五五〇室五〇三室進，三六〇室進雜出丙，較前收軋升一成至成半強不等，成交五百餘萬。</p>
<h3>銀根先俏後鬆　行局仍有鉅額差出</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根，走勢先俏後鬆，四行兩局一庫，於銀錢業票據交換中有鉅額差出，總數共三四，七三五億，就中中央銀行差出九，七八二億，中國銀行差出二二，八五八億，交通銀行差出四，八六五億，農民銀行差出一，一三二億，中信局差進二，八三七億，郵匯差出六億，中央合作金庫差進一，〇七一億。商業行莊大交換差出八五八億，小交換差進一四，四九八億，外商銀行共計差進二一，〇九五億。</p>
<p>籌碼奇缺</p>
<p>廿五萬新關金券，雖已發行，但現鈔籌碼仍甚枯竭，各行莊對客戶提現，仍限制極嚴，致客戶與行莊間紛爭頗多。據悉：新大鈔發行後，冬被人携往外埠，以套取匯水上之利益云。</p>
<h3>貨主扳價實銷呆滯　食米上落不多　特高粳臨收市況虛軟</h3>
<p>米市開市挺升，後市回落，由於產地價格之堅昂，貨主扳價殊力，早市挺升二三百萬元，但因實銷呆木，米店觀望，欲脫而少受主，乃趨回降。南北二市各檔粳薄稻，各見軋升一二百萬，特高粳仍站六千八百萬原價，至收市更見虛軟，僅與上日價格相仿。糙粳開五千五百萬，後吃慣五千四百萬未開。昨日到貨二市共計五五二二石。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>兎起　落，由於客幫銷路之淸淡，是以交易不多，早市尙岡扳高，後市終吿回軟，惟上落甚微。老軍粉最高至二三八〇萬，收市退爲二三四〇萬，兵船由二三〇〇萬退爲二二七〇萬，計漲二十至四十萬。紅蜂略挺十萬，建成終趨平定，麩皮加一二十萬，小麥廠盤三千主百萬開出。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>緩緩上涨，因業外物價亦疲，人心不振，客幫納胃有而不多，黄豆略加百萬元，漢口車豆三千七百萬元，苞米新貨較受客幫歡迎，挺升三四百萬元，元麥漲二百萬，蠶豆交易俱屬零星，價略加五十萬。紅糧未開，茶豆交少價平，芝蔴挺三四百萬，以黄蔴較俏，生仁　挫二百萬。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>生豆油市勢各有不同，豆油初開因業外物價平疲，故回籠貨先開一五八〇〇萬，盤旋後因出戶不多，乃吿挺升，况廠方開價不低，大有豆油收市仍升至一六二〇〇萬，與上日相平。生菜油最後爲一四二〇〇萬，亦殊平定。生油因上日價格較低，且存少銷活，故見挺升五百萬。小車蔴油客帮染指，上漲千萬之鉅。豆餅亦趨堅昂，加砌二三十萬元，利字餅一四一〇萬。</p>
<h3>茶市挺升</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，出口商續擬進取，且尤以珍眉等錄茶，怡和洋行及新華·午昌·各茶業公司，均有來者不拒之勢，惜市存迄未遞增，因此供應旣不暢盛，而執主喊價則高，臨收　果，交易依然平淡，價格方面，俱登高峯。至於內銷花色，一致不甘示弱，復再追随報挺。</p>

<h3>新買不動散多吐售　棉紗布市勢趨軟</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以隔日上漲太暴，客胃减遜，更因同業銀根又緊，圈外物價轉疲，紡建公司標價亦已抑低，散多吐售，市勢趨軟。</p>
<p>四十二支藍　細紗，初開堅挺，因連日所漲不若粗紗，廠商成本收關，拋售不多，因此開後再度提升一億二千萬元。旋以疲風猛襲，　時回降七八千萬元，迨近收時，不乏利賣論傳，卒以三十二億現出，三十二億五千萬明日出結束，比上日回小五千萬至億元，其他各支粗細紗，亦均較前微降三四五千萬不一，成交四十九包。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因有新經濟方案，及改革幣制等消息之顧慮，人心萎靡，新買戶不敢下手，市商及客帮均以暗息高昂，逢高有吐，散戶忍痛嘶割亦夥，市面乍升乍降。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開因染廠有補，市盤軋升八十萬元，嗣因賣多盤低四五百萬元，至十點半許，業中頭寸寬裕者，又來扒吸，行情後高至九千一百五十萬，終以九千萬元站住，比較上日步漲一百八十萬元，（比塲外喊價軋跌一百五十萬元。）</p>
<p>此外五福喇叭童陽鶴等細布，及細斜粗布漂布嗶嘰等，市均步秀自一百五十萬至五百萬，色布及士林布因廠盤調整，脚地穩固，一統納夫妥軋升一千萬元之鉅。</p>

<h3>世運籃球中比戰役　延長時間二分決勝負</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鍾震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敎航訊〕八月二日下午九時，吾國籃球隊仍在倫敎西部哈林　健身房，與比利時籃球隊作首次循環賽，因天雨時　，故觀衆並不擁擠，吾國隊员演出精彩萬分，終於在最後和局延長五分鐘時間中，以三十六比三十四，以一球之差，險勝比利時，吾國出席世運代表隊首次凱旋，實令人興奮之至。今將陣容及比賽經過記錄如次：</p>
<p>吳成章　黄天錫</p>
<p>蔡文華（賈志軍）</p>
<p>李世僑　包松圓。</p>
<p>一路佔先</p>
<p>今日因吾國籃球隊健將李世僑病愈由星加　搭機趨抵英倫，首次出塲助戰，聲勢大盛。開球後吾軍即以五比二領先，中鋒蔡文華遠射開花，以七比二先聲奪人。比利時念起追趕，扳回一球，左衛黄天錫不幸在比利時投籃時犯規，被罰二球，成七對六。此後吾軍展開攻勢，右鋒李世僑以快速純熟，美妙穩重姿態，與右鋒吳成章互相傳遞進攻，連進二球，使比利時連呼停戰，調將遣兵，犯規屢屢，上半時吾軍終以十六比十三佔先。</p>
<p>戰成平手</p>
<p>下半時易地後，吾單仍以原班人馬上塲，　戰移時，吳成章在空隙中，躍起單手擲入，中鋒蔡文華，又以遠射建功，中華隊以二十比十三遙遙領前。比利時急起反攻，奈投籃欠佳，度次不中，良機盡失，雖以硬性力併，亦無濟於事。至最後十分鐘，右衛黄天錫傷手調出，由賈志軍入塲，此時吾軍仍以三十二比二十六以六分佔先。不料在最後四分鐘時間中，比利時突趕反攻，連進三球，時間告終，以三十二對三十二和局。</p>
<p>延長決勝</p>
<p>延長五分鐘，易地後，局勢緊張萬分，雙力啦啦隊互相捧塲，狂呼「加油」二分鐘後比利時左右衛心慌，相繼犯規，被吾軍罰進四球，以三十六對三十二佔先。在最後一分鐘，比利時扳回一球，終以三十六比三十四擊敗比利時隊。此次吾國籃球隊時有精彩淸晰傳遞之表演，李世僑動作敏捷，靈活異常，吳成章智勇雙全，中鋒蔡文華遙射投籃準確，使國外觀衆，大加讚賞。二衛亦左右兼顧，較與智利交鋒時，已大有進步。</p>

<h3>我世運代表團　分批離英返國</h3>
<p>田漢祥談失敗原因</p>
<p>〔中央社昆明十八日電〕我世運代表團秘書田漢祥過昆時談稱：我代表團於大會閉幕後，分批離英，總領隊王正廷總幹事萱守義等，繞道美國考察。渠與樓文敖陳英郞王正林四人爲一批。籃球隊全體，後渠等兩日起程，刻在加城作友誼賽。繼調我選手於此次大會中雖未獲得決賽資格，就個人技術及運動精神而言，均較前屆進步。至失敗原因，由於體力不如人，及缺乏長期有組織之訓練。籃球隊於傳球技術上，亦有問題，因友邦選手特別是美國球員，多用快遞，我隊則仍用慢遞方式，勝負之數，由此而定。自由車選手何浩華，於比賽時頸骨折斷，左身全部擦傷，因不獲為祖國爭光而痛哭。何氏現留英療養，約兩週後可望出院。</p>

<h3>攙水的文章</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>一人日常所說言語，廢話恒十居其九。文章是經沈鍊之言語，文士下筆之際，理應如何扼要陳言。我國成語「言簡意賅」，該是文章的基本條件。換言之，文士作文宜做到一有話即長，無話即短」的地步。今人不但言語多廢話，文字上的廢話之多初不次於言語。鄙意以爲與其聽刺刺不休的廢話，倒不如索性大家患口吃症不能說話的好。古韓非「爲人口吃，不能道說，善著書」，他的所以「善著書」或許即是因爲「爲人口吃」，不善於說廢話之故吧？</p>
<p>以大體言，古人行文遠較今人爲簡潔。推原其故，古時印刷艱難，刻書不是易事，行文不得不簡約，是其一。其次：古人以「立言」與「立功」「立德」並舉，故有「道德文章」之語，古之聖賢更是爲了「道不行」這才「退而著書立說」，視之爲很重大的一件事，其用意與今人在未做官時拼命攻訐當局以爲進身之階不盡相同，與邱吉爾董吿退之後寫回憶錄追述往事以明治亂興衰之機却有相似處。再其次：古人著書時，心中初未計及稿費千字幾元，若依字數論値，孟子七篇凡三萬四千六百八十五字，照今日一般市値計算，約可賣得法幣二億元，足以換米三担，老子道德經五千言更不濟事，大約只可易得煤球二担；今之文人日揮五千字亦是常事，積一月之功便足以抵得三十僩老子，可是現代老子越多，其文也就越不足觀。</p>
<p>此言非謂文章寫不得，只是說不可依賣文爲生。魯迅囑子不要做「空頭文學家」，恐亦即是此意。但思如果孟干生於今世而以著作爲專業，而其家庭又非豪門巨富，則他縱不出妻，其妻亦必因難爲無米之炊而下堂求去；以著作爲業而攪到如此地步，豈非誤人目誤？</p>
<p>復次：古人因爲印書不易，故而行文簡潔，態度鄭重，固矣，然此絕非今日印刷發達即可行文草率內容隨便之謂。反之，惟其因爲今日印刷術發達，文人下筆之際愈應鄭重謹愼。試思以今日的印刷術，當天寫就的文章當天即可呈現於千萬讀者之前，傳播於全國各地，其影響之大不難想像，文人職資之重亦可不言而喻。而事置不然，今日儘有許多文章，考其用意，只是爲自己之私利說話，要不然便是敷析成章，把三二句話拉長爲洋洋灑灑的大文。蓋是文章亦隨通貨膨脹而膨脹而「冲淡」了。</p>
<p>讀漢明咸著「戰地鐘聲」，此書都三十餘萬言，然讀畢其書，覺得祗須三句話即可了事：西班牙內戰中有一位志士擬去炸毀一座橋，隨即與一個女子發生了數度肉體關係，書尾聲明志士終於把橋炸毀。作者盡可把這三句話寫在一枚郵票背面而不覺其擠，他却不嫌其煩，足足寫了四百六十七頁的大著。生平讀過的書之中要首推此書寫得最無聊最惡劣最荒唐最無意義可言。</p>
<p>然回顧我國，類似這樣的大著未始沒有。今人常認我國出版界貧乏，鄙意爲與其化了錢購讀以極爲惡劣的筆調所寫而意思又極爲淺薄的書籍，倒不如聽其貧乏，節省些紙張筆墨的好。</p>
<h3>報攤人語</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>余所居附近有一報攤（在金都電影院門西首），余常去買報或雜誌，在生意清閒時，常與賣報人小談。大公報·申報每份由四萬漲至八萬元時，各種刊物，皆同時漲價。彼告我：「未漲價之前，每天約可賣七百萬元上下，打兩分利，每天可凈得一百五十萬元；漲價之後，每天可賣一千萬元上下，不能加一倍到一千五百萬元。」現在大公報·申報每份賣到十六萬元，一日余問彼銷路情形，彼言：「與前一樣，報價及雜誌書籍漲起又一倍，銷路則只能到百分之五六十，星期日或可賣到兩千萬元，平日只能賣一千五六百萬元，現在每天凈得三百萬元光景，因物價在半月間或一月內常常跳起一倍多至兩三倍，生活反不如從前一百五十萬元收入時的寬裕。」又吿我：「家中有四口，一月雖有八九千萬元，生活仍極苦。」余問大報，小報，雜誌銷路情形，彼言：「大報漲價之後，銷路仍可照常，以新聞報，申報，大公報賣得最多；小報在從前，如飛報，羅實漢，鐵報，銷路不錯，漲價之後，買者較少；雜誌以觀察最易銷，展望，新聞天地等次之。」試分析以上話，可得一結論，即在最近兩月漲風之中，讀者約减少三分之一。</p>
<p>七月二十二日大公報的出版界欄，有一篇「出版業的惡夢」，內言：「他夢見物價先生駕着飛機，上面載着許多乘客，個個都是肥胖健壯，紅光滿面。這些乘客的名字他都記得；有黄金小姐，白銀夫人，大米先生，麵粉少爺……等等，他再看看自己和他的友伴，如稿費，報紙，書籍，作家，讀者等人，都是鷹形鵠面，現着深度的菜色，他不覺苦笑了一下。」</p>
<p>這篇文章係寒松君的作品，寫得極爲深刻，讀之令人尷尬得很，欲笑不得。現在文化事業確已到了絕境，不但出版人，作家，讀者，現着深度的菜色，即報攤中人，亦已受到極大的影饗。特寫此篇，以補充寒松若所寫之不及。</p>
<h3>連載了卅三年的小說</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>世界上最長的長篇連載小說，是美國一位女作家阿黛爾加利遜著的「情海駭濤」（此意係意譯，直譯應爲「愛情的驚險的過程」）。這一小說同時由好幾家報紙登載，已經登了三十三年，而目前似乎還沒有結束的意思。小說的內容是講一家姓葛蘭漢的人家的悲歡離合，重要的主角有二十個人。從開始刊載迄今，已經登了一千萬字。</p>
<h3>近詩三章</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>河南河北又兵戈，雁失歸羣燕失窠，夕照洛陽宮一角，天涯涕淚在銅駝！</p>
<p>落帆亭</p>
<p>落帆亭外落帆船，船去船來共一川（亭在嘉興城外，舟楫過此下帆），妾似來船郞似去，去來船總讓人先。</p>
<p>汪亞塵自美寄贈魚樂圖</p>
<p>殷勤寓里故人書，展拜新鱗錦不如，栩栩幾忘身是蝶，愉愉寗識我非魚；曾經桑海參三昩，久歷風波付一噓，兵革黄塵今似昔，天涯猶有白雲居。</p>
<h3>孟蘭盆會</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>農歷十二個月分中，七月算是「鬼月」，故一到這月，民間風俗，例有所謂孟蘭盆會，尤以十五日這一天爲最熟閙。記得幼時喜看出會儀仗中的大頭鬼，小頭鬼，無常鬼等，尤喜看鬼王，又最怕看鬼王，於今想來，可發一笑。現在這種玩意兒已見不到，所見到的，只有街頭巷口設增延僧，施放燄口，算是點綴這鬼節了。</p>
<p>考「孟蘭」二字原係天竺語譯音，意即「倒懸」，謂做此功德，可解地獄衆生倒懸之苦，並非驅瘟逐疫。故顏之推家訓終制篇有「若報罔極之德，霜露之悲，有時齋供，及七月半孟蘭會，望於汝也」之語，終制篇即之推的遺囑，諄諄提及「孟蘭盆」，是可作並非驅瘟逐疫之證，且知六朝時已有這玩意兒了，今蘇俗人死後逢到第一個七月半，謂之「新七月半」，子孫必延僧諷經超度，以盡孝思，猶是六朝時的遺意，不過不時做盂蘭盆罷了。</p>
<h3>龔孝拱與趙惠甫</h3>
<p>— 銖安</p>
<p>龔孝拱是傳說中的漢奸，但是始終沒有證據。在北都曾見有人將他的親筆函扎一大册覓售，上款都是寫給趙惠甫的。字跡非常奇詭，一望而知其人之不平正，然而講到他自己的學術思想，還是經學家的口吻，講到當時的朝廷，也還守臣子的規矩，不像傳說那樣的狂妄，這是關於襲氏身世的最好的硏究材料，可惜不知現歸誰氏所有了。後來看見近入陳乃乾氏所編趙惠甫年譜，方知趙氏能靜居日記也曾流出，其中有致魏般仲書述及與龔氏因售碑而失和，事極曲折瑣屑，蓋因窮而賣物，因賣物而斤斤於價値，亦收藏家名士常所不免也。其所以致函魏氏者，謂彼此均屬至好，能任調解也。默深定庵同屬道光朝名士，因其講求掌故，留意時務，故皆不滿現狀，又因傾向今文經學，歡喜非常異義可怪之論，思想行爲，都爲當時人所看不慣，所以越來越乖僻。聽說魏默翁晚年親自把他自著的聖武記劈了板，又相傳說他晚年染痰病，是不是有了些革命意識，頗爲可疑。孝拱之被人月爲漢奸，也難免是革命思想之流露。即趙惠甫號稱會湘鄉的門下，他的同治六年日記中，就有一段不滿淸朝的表示。</p>
<p>……余曰：天下治安一統久矣，勢必馴至分剖，然主德素重，風氣未開，若非抽心一爛，則土崩瓦解之局不成。以烈度之，異日之禍，必先根本顚仆，而後方州無主，人自爲政，殆不出五十年矣。師蹙網良久曰：然則當南遷乎？余云：恐遂陸沈，未必效晋宋也。師曰：本朝君德正，或不至此。余曰：君德正矣，而國勢之隆，食報已不爲不厚；國初創業太易，誅戮太重，所以有天下者太巧，天道難知，善惡不相掩，後君之德澤未足恃也。</p>
<p>同治六年到宣統三年，正是四十五年，他的預言竟驗了。</p>
<h3>靜坐經驗談（二）</h3>
<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>二十七個月來實際經過情形</p>
<p>我在初坐時，身邊置錶一，默數呼吸，每一呼吸爲一次，最初呼吸不能延長，故經過一百次，需時極短，後來不　加功，使呼吸逐漸延長，半年後每百次即需要十分鐘，到現在已經是十五分鐘了。竹老曾：「每百次能有十五分鐘，已經很好。」我相信以後還可以延長。</p>
<p>靜坐時以思念不起一事爲最難做到，有時你愈要排除思念，而思念之來，反而層出不窮，此最令人煩悶。對付這個困難，別無他法，只有緩緩鍛鍊，慢慢降伏。就是我到了現在真正能繼續一念不起的境界，也僅够保持到十五分鐘，過此我便不敢說了。我相信這樣不斷的鍜鍊下去，可以使無思無念的時間會能繼續延長的。</p>
<p>腦中淸靜，一念不起，所以使知覺神經和運動神經，全部休息，這對於健身，當然是關係極大。同時還有深細呼吸的方法，隨之而行，此即所謂腹部運動，使交感神經，得到鍛鍊。惟其這樣，在初習靜坐時，便有兩神令人不耐煩的情勢發生：（一）胸部悶而不舒，因爲通常呼吸時，筋肉運動只在橫隔膜上，今行深細呼吸，則橫隔膜必上下擺動，此在練習未熟時，最感覺難受，尤其在一兩個月時，難受得更厲害。我在經歷這個感覺時，用極大的忍耐心情來克制牠，過了三四個月，便覺胸部空鬆，泰然自如了。（二）還有無念一層，有時也令人感到煩悶，愈要不思，而思如潮湧，打消一念，一念復來，如是忍耐不住的話，竟要　然而起，不願再坐了。我因爲先已下了決心，對此還能勉强應付，大約也經過四五個月後，也就不覺得如何煩悶了。</p>
<p>經過四五個月後，第一感到舒服的，是腹部發暖，暖而繼之以熱。迨至七八個月後，熟乃更增。一年以後，熟且擴大範圍，有時上達胸部，延及上肢，後達臂部延及後背，此時眞是全身感到莫可言喻的愉快。我記得三十六年五月間—即靜坐經過一年以後，有一次，腹部發熱，忽然感到胸部發麻發鬆，皮膚筋肉皆發生美滿的快感，如此約經過十分鐘。今年六月間—即經過靜坐二年以後，又有一次，腹部發熱後，胸部即感到酥鬆，旋即擴展到左右兩臂兩手。惟腹部發熱，並非每次靜坐皆然，大約十次之中，總有六七次。又腹部發熱通常皆在靜坐經過三十分鐘後始發覺，但也有僅坐十幾分鐘即感到發熱的，此則次數較少。我相信如此繼續靜坐下去，綜上面所述胸部酥鬆等妙境，還要「源源而來」哩。</p>
<p>在初靜坐五六個月後，頭部神經，感到蠕動，但並非發麻，有時頭的兩邊，像各有一條線在皮下作蠕動狀，由上下行，經過面部兩側，以達於頸，彷彿下達到胸部，　其狀不甚難暑。有一次，我感到頭頂皮下蠕動頗烈，旋及正頂，似乎右中間分裂開來成了一縫，但一刹那間，即停止如常。此種神經蠕動之狀，至兩年以後，即逐漸减少，到最近幾個月，已少有此種感覺了。有時僅僅一顯，旋即消減。</p>
<p>還有在四五個月後，腿部忽然作小顫動，如此者三四次，今已久沒有這種現象了。</p>

<h3>President and Sun Yat-sen's Grandson Return to Nanjing; Important Meeting in the Capital Today; Economic Reform Plan Soon to be Announced</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling by Our Newspaper, 18th] The President, due to important official matters requiring his handling in Nanjing, departed from Kuling this afternoon, the 18th, and returned to the capital. His wife remained in Kuling. Sun Ke and others returned to Nanjing on the same plane. It is reported that the President will stay in Nanjing for a few days and then return to Kuling. Before the President left the mountain, Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan, Presidential Office Secretary Cao Shengfen, and attendants had already descended the mountain and arrived at Shiliupu Airport. Gansu Chairman Hu Jiafeng, Lushan Administration Director Wang Zuomin, and others also went to Shiliupu to respectfully see him off. When the President departed from his official residence at 4:30 PM, his wife and Mr. Chen Bulei escorted him to the residence's entrance. Sun Ke, Yu Jishi, Shi Zude, and others accompanied him in the sedan. Sun Ke went first, followed by the President in his sedan. At that time, few people outside knew about it. As the procession passed through the main street, the public on both sides bowed to the President to pay their respects. The President took off his hat in the sedan and nodded in acknowledgment. At 5:50 PM, they arrived at Lotus Cave and immediately transferred to cars, heading directly to Shiliupu Airport. They boarded the "Meiling" special plane, along with two attendant planes, which took off one after another for Nanjing. Before the President left Kuling, he had a casual lunch with President Sun Ke at noon and invited Secretary Chen Bulei to accompany them. They talked for a long time during the meal.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 18th] President Chiang returned to Nanjing at 7:30 PM this evening on a special plane from Kuling. Sun Ke, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Cao Shengfen, Yu Jishi, and others returned with him. The President will personally preside over the Central Political Committee meeting convened on the 19th to resolve several important issues and is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Kuling on the 20th. It is also learned that Vice President Li's originally scheduled trip to Kuling on the 19th has been temporarily suspended. After meeting with the President, he may fly to Kuling with the President on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 18th] Since the President left Nanjing for Lushan on the 9th, it has been almost ten days. The President, being in the fresh air and beautiful scenery of Kuling, has been able to conduct thorough research on the overall political and economic situation in the country. It is generally speculated that the President must have made a significant decision on economic reform during this period. Well-informed sources say that there are still one or two parts of the economic reform issue that need to be studied. It is expected that several important meetings will be held continuously in the coming days to discuss and decide on this issue.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 18th] The government has the greatest determination for economic reform, and this decision is the result of the President's careful consideration and research. Therefore, since the President returned to Nanjing on the evening of the 18th, the capital has been focusing on the content of this decision until midnight. It is widely believed that the three important meetings to be held on the 19th will definitely make decisions and announcements regarding this matter. It is heard that the reform of the monetary system will also be part of the economic reform. Furthermore, after arriving in Nanjing, because the official residence on Huangpu Road is under repair, the President is temporarily staying at Song Ziwen's residence in Beijige. In the evening, he invited Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, and other key officials to a meeting to finalize the plan. Several people are looking forward to and commenting on the economic reform plan, which may be unveiled in 24 hours, and it is believed to be the most practical plan to meet all current needs.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 18th] The Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang is scheduled to be held in the afternoon of the 19th, and will be presided over by the President himself. The reorganization of the Henan and Jiangsu provincial governments will be discussed at the meeting. Before the meeting, a Central Standing Committee meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on the 19th to first discuss party affairs reform issues. It is also learned that the economic reform plan may also be submitted to the Central Political Committee for discussion on the 19th. After the Central Political Committee meeting, a temporary Executive Yuan Political Affairs Committee meeting will be convened. If any decisions are made at the meeting, they will be announced and implemented immediately. People in Nanjing are currently taking all the meetings in the coming day very seriously.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 18th] Premier Weng Wenhao's new economic plan was only discussed in broad terms at the Executive Yuan Political Affairs Meeting on the 18th, without any concrete plan being seen.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 18th] A certain authoritative source informed reporters on the 18th that Premier Weng's new economic reform plan is being actively organized and discussed, and the announcement date is not far off.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Turbulent Situation in Burma</h3>
<p>Since Burma declared its independence on January 4th of this year, serious party strife has erupted within the country. If the current Prime Minister, Thakin Nu, is not firm enough, the surging communist forces may have already swept across Burma. The Burmese Communist Party is currently carrying out armed rebellion against the government in various parts of the north and south. A portion of the Volunteer Army, affiliated with the Freedom League, also mutinied and besieged Rangoon on the 14th of this month. The government suppressed the siege with overwhelming land and air forces, and the siege of Rangoon was temporarily lifted, and external communications have also been restored. The current regime may be able to achieve stability. However, the red atmosphere throughout Burma is still expanding, and the serious situation has not weakened. A Rangoon dispatch from the Associated Press frankly pointed out that the situation in Burma is far more serious than generally expected. The government must resort to the strongest measures to curb the communist rebels, as the rebels have the most outstanding military talents. Therefore, the Burmese civil war is just beginning, and its future development deserves close attention.</p>
<p>Burma is located in the western part of the Indochina Peninsula, bordering the Bay of Bengal to the southwest. The entire territory is divided into Upper Burma and Lower Burma: Upper Burma is connected to Yunnan and Xikang in China, forming its northeastern face; Lower Burma borders Siam to the east and India to the west. The Burmese mountains are purely the remnants of the Hengduan Mountains in China, and the Irrawaddy River originates purely from the highlands of Kangzang. The relationship between China and Burma has always been close, and the China-Burma Highway passes through the Hengduan Mountains, so the movements in Burma are closely related to China. Based on this relationship, we attach importance to the current situation in Burma; based on the safety of our southwestern border, we are concerned about the current turmoil in Burma. The current coup in Burma is not accidental, it is a link in the communist atmosphere in Southeast Asia and even all of Asia drilling into the Iron Curtain. We should point out the crux of the Burmese turmoil and its relationship to the overall situation in Asia.</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of the nature of the political parties, the current party strife in Burma is a struggle between the Freedom League and the Communist Party; from the perspective of the division of thought, it is a struggle between socialism and communism; from the perspective of the opposition between left and right, it is a struggle between the left wing and the left wing. This is the crux of the political turmoil in Burma. The current ruling party in Burma is the Freedom League, and Thakin Nu is a world-renowned socialist, whose thought is more thorough than even Fabianism. He is honest and impartial, and has fought for independence and freedom for many years. He is the only person who can lead the country after General Aung San. On May 25th of this year, he announced the Fifteen Articles of the Left-Wing Solidarity Program, the content of which is more revolutionary and progressive than even the Communist Party. However, he ignored cooperation with the Communist Party, he declared the Burmese Communist Party an illegal organization, and he believed that opposition parties should not possess armed forces, otherwise they would be completely suppressed. The British were extremely surprised by Thakin Nu's left wing: Soviet public opinion also stared wide-eyed. But Thakin Nu remained firm and unyielding, not hesitating to fight the Communist Party ideologically, politically, and militarily. This shows that the party strife in Burma is a struggle between two lefts.</p>
<p>Second, the rebellion of the Burmese Communist Party is developing in coordination with the recent communist forces in Southeast Asia. It is not an isolated action force, and the strength of the Burmese Communist Party is worthy of attention. The Burmese Communist Party has workers in the trade unions, constantly inciting labor strikes: in the schools, it has student alliances, constantly inciting student strikes. Starting from February 9th of this year, the Burmese Communist Party began to hold armed riots in northern Burma, taking advantage of the fact that the country had just declared its independence and the internal affairs were in a state of transition, thereby controlling places such as Donggua, Basheng, and Saga, and reaching Myitkyina and Puta-O, sixty to eighty miles from Rangoon. Recently, it has even besieged the capital Rangoon. The Burmese Communist Party has tried to win over the Volunteer Army, which is inclined to the Freedom League. The recent siege of Rangoon was the mutiny of the Volunteer Army. The power of the Burmese Communist Party has gradually developed in the past six months, and it has established close ties with the communist forces in Malaya, Siam, and other places. The Burmese independent newspaper, the He Wei Bao, published an article on July 7th opposing the replacement of the Siamese ambassador, citing that the Soviet embassy in Siam had more than 40 staff members, while there were only 10 Siamese Soviet overseas Chinese, and pointing out that Bangkok has now become a major base for instigating riots by the Burmese Communist Party. Although these arguments are inevitably exaggerated, the fact that the Burmese Communist Party is of the same breath as the communist forces in Southeast Asia is obvious. Thakin Nu firmly refuses to compromise with the Burmese Communist Party, precisely because he recognizes that the Burmese Communist Party is not a nationalist party and cannot talk about the unity of a national state with it.</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, the development of the Burmese political situation is subtle, and the battle between socialism and communism is appearing in a corner of Southeast Asia today. This is very different from the situation in Malaya, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Looking at the overall trend, the Burmese government is determined to suppress the Communist Party to the end. Foreign Minister Wu Dingtu has resigned and joined the army. Thakin Nu has decided to resign from parliament on August 16th, and may be succeeded by Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Bo Liye. Thakin Nu's future path is to join the army. He is determined to use the power of spiritual influence and the power of truth to persuade the Communist Party to lay down its arms and implement the nationalization of the army. Thakin Nu's political aspirations and his goals of struggle are to strive for the principle of "forcing the Communist Party to abandon arms." In short, the development of the Burmese turmoil has a great relationship with the future of Asia. May Thakin Nu hold the helm of the times steady and struggle bravely forward!</p>
<h3>Smuggling on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Rampant Again: China and Hong Kong to Jointly Combat Smuggling, Luo Qingxiang and Gogoer Arrive in Guangzhou to Meet Song Ziwen</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] Smuggling on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is gradually becoming rampant again, especially the smuggling of white rice. Recently, a so-called "group charge" method has been implemented. When the train arrives in Shenzhen from Guangzhou, the smugglers unite a thousand or hundreds of people, carry white rice on their shoulders, and rush straight to the small paths along the fields. If customs officers intervene slightly, they will be collectively dealt with by the smugglers, leaving the customs officers helpless.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] Due to various indications, the date of implementation of the China-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement is becoming increasingly close. Luo Qingxiang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs in charge of anti-smuggling, and Gogoer, Commissioner of Customs of Kowloon, arrived in Guangzhou on the 18th. Luo was the Chinese government representative who came south two months ago to sign the China-Australia customs agreement. Some time ago, Gogoer went to Shanghai to ask for instructions on issues related to the China-Hong Kong agreement. Luo then accompanied Gogoer back to Hong Kong, and stayed in Hong Kong for many days before coming to Guangzhou today. According to the Guangdong Customs, Luo's visit is to inspect the current situation of anti-smuggling in South China. However, according to other sources, Luo has repeatedly negotiated with the Hong Kong side in Hong Kong, and his visit is to meet with Chairman Song to discuss issues related to this agreement. It is not yet known whether Song will go to Hong Kong. However, the day after Song returned to Guangzhou, he convened an anti-smuggling meeting and decided to launch a full-scale armed anti-smuggling campaign, which is believed to be a measure to cooperate with the implementation of this agreement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Song Ziwen received Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, who had just rushed back from Hong Kong, at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th to discuss economic and diplomatic issues related to China and Hong Kong.

He Guoguang received reporters from this newspaper alone at his private residence on the morning of the 17th and spoke freely about border affairs: (1) The Design Committee's funding for border affairs has not been included in the Executive Yuan's budget this year, so there is no special fund to handle the five-year development plan. It has been brought back separately by Sichuan representative Zeng Nanfu, Kang representative Wu Liucun, and Yunnan representative Li Guoqing. Wang Lingji has telegraphed his agreement, and after Liu Wenhui and Lu Han express their opinions, they will convene a meeting to implement the plan. (2) Xichang has a climate like spring all year round, suitable for animal husbandry and planting buckwheat and kapok. In addition, silk can be harvested four times a year, and there are many mineral deposits, all waiting to be developed. (3) The visit of the Yi ethnic group to the mainland has had a significant impact on the Yi people. They have actively contributed funds and requested the establishment of schools and roads, and praised President Chiang's grace and the central government's good policies. (4) Governing border areas must emphasize politics over military affairs. Force should not be used unless absolutely necessary. He emphasized enlightenment and education for the Yi ethnic group, and persuaded the chieftains to submit to the jurisdiction of the local government. Recently, Da Tu Kemo Songdian, the chief of Mugong in Yanyuan County, southern Kang, sent Mengong to Xichang to offer ten horses and five taels of gold, and advocated donating a special donation for relief, which is a major change in the attitude of the chieftain towards the government. The Mugong chieftain has not had contact with government agencies for more than ten years, emphasizing politics over military affairs. He did not confirm that Dao Jingban, the chieftain of Ganai in western Yunnan, had invited chieftains such as Huangshi to convene another design committee for the Bai Yi in Yunnan, Kang, and Sichuan.</p>

<h3>Ironclad Proof of Communist Spies Creating Student Unrest (Part 2)</h3>
<p>As for the destructive actions of communist student spies in creating student unrest in government areas, they are in complete and close harmony with all the appeals and demands of the communists, fitting together like pieces of a puzzle. For example, the ten major tasks proposed by Mao Zedong on New Year's Day in the 34th year of the Republic [1945], Zhu De's broadcast on New Year's Day in the 36th year of the Republic [1947], and Mao Zedong's report at the Central Committee meeting of the Chinese Communist Party on December 25th in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] all mentioned the so-called liberated areas and government areas in the same breath, and particularly emphasized carrying out extensive mass movements in government areas, putting forward deceptive slogans such as "People's Patriotic Democratic Movement" or "Struggle for Survival." The various student unrests created by communist student spies, and the various slogans shouted out in the successive student unrests, completely matched the demands of these two major appeals by the communists. For example, "Anti-Hunger Movement," "Eat It All Movement," "Anti-Civil War Movement," and "Anti-Tyranny Movement" are even more obvious examples. In fact, the communists' proposal of these two major deceptive slogans was a strategic offensive to disintegrate the government's rear. Under the communists' brutal rule in the communist areas and their policy of closely following the Communist International, the so-called "People's Patriotic Democratic Movement" or "Struggle for Survival" is nothing short of a strong irony. However, communist student spies, nurtured by the communists, took advantage of the government's leniency and accommodation to create various student unrests in government areas without any scruples, to respond to the communists' malicious conspiracy, and sometimes even altered the nature of a movement that originated from the so-called "Struggle for Survival." For example, the "Anti-Hunger Cake Movement" launched by communist professional students last May was transformed into a rebellious movement of "Anti-Conscription," "Anti-Grain Levy," and "Anti-Civil War." Isn't this tantamount to regarding themselves as communist military spies and urban workers, and openly opening up a so-called "second battlefield" in the government's rear?</p>
<p>Moreover, after communist student spies were able to openly and unscrupulously control student organizations in various schools and suppress the majority of good students, they openly turned the sacred and dignified halls of learning into illegal concessions that sheltered communist bandits, and used the schools as centers for launching "urban work activities" to the outside world. Thus, in these Soviet-style school concessions, they openly set up "courts" to "publicly try" good students, monitor the words and deeds of teachers, establish "defense alliances," and even lure young people to escape to communist areas to serve the communists' schemes, treating schools as recruitment agencies for the communists.</p>
<p>2. How Communist Student Spies Create Student Unrest</p>
<p>Under the conspiracy and fabrication of communist student spies who speak sweet words but do evil deeds, large-scale student unrests have been rising one after another in recent years. Among them, the following student unrests are the largest in scale and the deepest in conspiracy:</p>
<p>(1) Using the excuse of opposing the civil war to create the "December 1st" incident in Kunming: At the end of November of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], communist student spies in Kunming used the name of opposing the civil war to instigate strikes in major middle schools and universities. Fortunately, most students saw through the conspiracy and organized anti-strike committees to strongly oppose it. The schools that had already gone on strike resumed classes one after another. Seeing that their conspiracy was not working, communist student spies did not hesitate to resort to violence to carry out sabotage. Just as the students of the Southwest Associated University were holding a meeting to discuss anti-strike matters, a commando team organized by professional students rushed into the meeting place and beat people, disrupting the meeting. They also used weapons and broke into various schools one after another, forcing teachers and students to strike. However, on November 30th, when communist student spies at the Southwest Associated University openly held a meeting on campus to coerce students to strike, the cadets of the Second General Team of Officers in Kunming, according to a pre-arranged schedule, visited Daguanlou [Grand View Pavilion]. As they marched in formation past the school, communist student spies in the school launched an attack with mud, bricks, and tiles, mixed with shouts and insults. The cadets initially retreated and avoided the attack, but then, unable to evade, they began to fight back. The cadets, feeling that they had been humiliated for no reason, sent a written inquiry but received no response. So on December 1st, they collectively went to the Teachers College of the Southwest Associated University to inquire. While they were waiting, Chen Qida, an unemployed soldier bought off by communist bandits, broke in and threw a hand grenade into the college, creating a tragedy. At the same time, hand grenades were also thrown at the cadets in the Literature College of the same school, injuring them. After the tragedy occurred, communist student spies in Kunming City took advantage of the unclear truth to blame the government, claiming that it was using special agents to massacre students, and launched a general strike in all schools in the city. Later, after the government executed the murderer and dismissed the security authorities, the communist student spies' conspiracy to create a nationwide student unrest ultimately failed. However, this incident opened the prelude to communist student spies disrupting schools and destroying education.</p>
<p>(2) Using the "Shen Chong Incident" to create an anti-American movement: On the evening of December 24th of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], Ms. Shen Chong, a student in the preparatory class of Peking University, was raped by US Marine Corporal Pierson. This incident was an illegal act by Pierson personally. The government and the people were equally indignant. The Beiping Headquarters even submitted a serious memorandum to the US military authorities, demanding that the rapist be severely punished. This was originally a simple legal issue and should not have been mixed with diplomacy and politics. However, communist student spies in various places saw this as a great opportunity to undermine Sino-US relations and actively planned to launch an unprecedentedly large anti-American movement in various places. They first launched strikes and parades at Peking University and other schools on the 30th, emphasizing that "US troops should withdraw from China immediately." By the beginning of January, communist student spies in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Kunming, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and other places had successively planned similar strikes and parades. Their actions and slogans were completely consistent in various places. They took this opportunity to form the "National Student Anti-Tyranny Federation," which acted as an accomplice for the communists.</p>
<p>(3) Launching the "Eat It All Movement" and creating the "May 20th" incident: The "May 20th" incident was rooted in the conspiracy of the "One School, One Affair Movement" during the Communist May-Fourth student unrest. At the same time, the issue of Ying Shi University's relocation, the issue of Jiaotong University's merging of departments, the anti-cumulative point system of Shanghai University, the issue of changing the director and establishing a college at the Oriental Language College, the issue of changing the director and relocating the school at Zhongzheng University, and the issue of public funding for Jinan Central Jinling and other schools successively broke out. Since mid-May, Nanjing, led by Zhongda [Central University], had been brewing an extraneous "Public Funding Movement" and launching the so-called "Eat It All Movement." On "May 20th," led by Zhongda and Jinda [Jinling University], communist student spies coerced a portion of the students, and gathered so-called student representatives from Yingda, the School of Social Education, and the cities of Shanghai and Hangzhou, to form a large-scale marching team. They did not listen to the advice of the security authorities and the well-intentioned dissuasion of the unarmed police maintaining order, insulted the security personnel in every possible way, and attempted to violently break through the police cordon, resulting in clashes with the unarmed police, with mutual injuries. The communist student spies then expanded the propaganda to the so-called "May 20th" blood case, using this to spark a full-scale student unrest. Fortunately, their conspiracy was seen through by students across the country, and the incident was not allowed to escalate. (The text continues on page 5)</p>

<h3>New Danube River Navigation Convention: US, UK, France, Austria Refuse to Sign; Belgrade Conference Declares Closure</h3>
<p>[News Report] London, 18th Broadcast, Belgrade News: The Danube River Conference today, by a vote of seven to zero, with the UK, US, and France abstaining, passed the new convention proposed by the Soviet Union. At 5:30 PM (Belgrade time), Chairman Vyshinsky announced the close of the conference.</p>
<p>[News Report] Washington, 18th Broadcast: Marshall stated at a press conference that the representatives of the four countries of the US, UK, France, and Austria at the Danube River Conference refused to sign the Danube River Convention drafted by the Soviet Union. The US government has instructed the US representative, Kennan, not to sign the convention, and stated that the representatives of the other three countries also hold the same attitude.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Belgrade, 18th Dispatch] The head of the UK delegation to the Danube River Conference, Baker, before the vote on the new Danube River Treaty, declared that the UK believes that the 1921 Danube River Treaty remains in effect and cannot recognize the exclusive rights to Danube River navigation specially granted to certain Danube River riparian states in the new treaty. He also stated that the governments of Belgium, Greece, and Italy had requested the UK government to notify the conference that they all reserve their rights related to the Danube River. US representative Kennan echoed the UK representative's statement, saying, "We regret that we cannot guarantee the freedom of navigation on the Danube River. Without this guarantee, we cannot accept the new treaty presented to us."</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Belgrade, 18th Dispatch] French representative Sine Eli, before the vote on the new Danube River Treaty this morning, gave a speech declaring that he, representing the French government, cannot accept the treaty drafted by the Danube River Conference, which began on July 31st.

At the same time, Soviet representative Vyshinsky announced that the Soviet Union would automatically waive its two voting rights in the Danube River Commission because the Soviet Union would also be representing Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Molotov Makes New Demands; Moscow Negotiations in Stalemate; Three Envoys Receive Instructions to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>[News Report] London, 18th Broadcast: The governments of the UK, US, and France delivered new instructions to the three envoys in Moscow on the 18th, preparing for the next meeting at the Kremlin. Officials refused to reveal whether the next meeting would be with Molotov again, or with both Molotov and Stalin. Diplomatic circles believe that unless there are concrete signs of mutual agreement between the two sides, the current negotiations cannot continue for long. As of now, none of the news from the meetings is optimistic. The three envoys are currently considering a final meeting with Stalin.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] It is rumored that Molotov recently made important suggestions during talks with the special envoys of the three Western powers. The British Foreign Office neither confirmed nor denied this claim.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] After the report of British special envoy Roberts arrived here, political and diplomatic circles all expressed pessimism. What is incomprehensible is that all evening newspapers tonight announced in large headlines that the three Western powers have accepted the principle of postponing the organization of the West German government, on the condition that the Soviet Union lift the Berlin blockade. However, well-informed observers say that it is highly doubtful that Moscow has reached any compromise.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 18th Dispatch] It is learned that if the Moscow talks fail, the Western countries have prepared a comprehensive plan for Germany. Diplomatic sources pointed out that the talks currently taking place in the Kremlin have reached an impasse because the Soviet Union has made demands that the Western countries cannot accept. They said that unless the Soviet Union immediately withdraws its demands, the Berlin crisis will return to the situation before the talks, and the Soviet blockade will reach its worst state. If this situation arises, the first step for the Western countries will be to concentrate on strengthening the airlift to Berlin, and the second step will be to accelerate the establishment of a West German government, allowing the Soviet Union to implement its strategy for its occupation zone alone. This speculation about the new plan for Berlin was reported on the 17th, as the commanders of the Western countries held a meeting that day, the results of which were not announced. According to reports from Waldorf in southwestern Germany, more than 1,000 US and French troops are engaged in combat exercises.</p>
<h3>Free Travel Restored in Three Western German Occupation Zones</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Baden-Baden, 18th Dispatch] Free travel between the French occupation zone in Germany and the British and American occupation zones will be restored starting August 20th. Travel passports between the three zones will also be abolished. However, the regulations of each zone regarding the residence of German citizens will remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Czech Foreign Minister Doesn't Believe There Will Be a New War</h3>
<p>Czech and Soviet Union to Conduct Trade Negotiations</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Belgrade, 17th Dispatch] The semi-official news agency "Setega" here today published an interview between Czech Foreign Minister Clementis and an American interviewer. According to Clementis, there is no reason for a new war to break out today. Hundreds of millions of people are all hoping for peace. Although the international situation has deteriorated since last year, there is no threat of war. We oppose violating the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam agreements, and we advocate that the United Nations Charter should be respected. He also stated that in the current situation, the Western powers should be held responsible because their policies are aimed at revising the existing treaties and agreements. Clementis then denied the rumors that the people's democracies are at odds with each other. Finally, he said that resolving the German problem is the most important factor in moving towards peace and improving relations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. The economic vacuum currently formed by Germany should be eliminated, no matter how difficult it may be.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Prague, 17th Dispatch] The Czech trade delegation, led by Minister of Foreign Trade Gregor, left here by plane for Moscow today.

<h3>Anti-Tito Yugoslav General Flees to Romania, Shot Dead; Two Accompanying Officers, One Dead, One Arrested</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Belgrade, 18th Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior issued a public statement today stating that former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff General Uvalnovic, accompanied by two senior military officers, attempted to cross the border into Romania on the evening of the 11th. They were discovered by border guards and shot. Uvalnovic was killed on the spot.</p>
<p>According to Uvalnovic's position in the Yugoslav army, he was second only to Marshal Tito. (Yugoslav exiles in London claim that Uvalnovic's escape to Romania was probably to assume the position of commander-in-chief of the "Free Yugoslav Army" to support the Cominform's movement to overthrow Tito. It is also claimed that the Cominform is deliberately setting up a puppet government in Yugoslavia to oppose Tito. During the war, Tito and Uvalnovic were inseparable, but Uvalnovic has been expelled from Tito's inner circle for a year.) The Ministry of Interior statement also stated that the two people accompanying Uvalnovic, Colonel Dacic, had fled into Romania, while Major General Petre Cvejic was arrested a few yards from the border. Also killed was Alabapa Bak, the director of the government's border industries bureau. The statement said: "Ah氏受三人之紿代爲引路而'不知彼等圖非法入羅馬尼亞。'" According to the confession of the arrested major general, the three had long agreed to flee, but falsely claimed to be hunting wild boars to go to the border. At that time, a sentry saw three people hurrying towards the border. One of them suddenly opened fire on the sentry. The sentry, for the sake of self-defense, immediately returned fire, killing two people on the spot. The other two fled to the border." The statement did not explain the reason for the three people's escape.</p>
<p>[News Report] London, 18th Broadcast, Prague News: A Communist newspaper on the 18th published an open letter from the Yugoslav embassy attacking Tito and the Yugoslav Communist Party.

Representatives from the Ministry of Defence and the Army Staff Headquarters participated.

<h3>Rhee Syngman Declares to Reporters That Korea Will Demand Soviet Recognition; Unstable Korean Situation, UK Says It Will Not Recognize For Now</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Seoul, 18th Dispatch] South Korean President Rhee Syngman told reporters yesterday that the three major powers, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, had previously expressed de facto recognition of the government of the Republic of Korea. However, the Soviet Union has not made any statement. From Korea's standpoint, the independence and construction of a new Korea can only be ultimately achieved with the joint support of the four countries, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. In the future, the Korean government will continue to strive to negotiate with the Soviet Union, requesting it to adopt an attitude consistent with that of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Korean government is currently preparing all the materials in preparation for making a claim for compensation to Japan in the future.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] Authorities said that Britain's non-recognition of the Rhee Syngman government in South Korea at present has no political significance. The British government is willing to wait for the United Nations General Assembly to pass the report of the United Nations Special Committee on Korea before considering whether to recognize the Korean government. According to well-informed sources, the reason why the United Kingdom has adopted the current attitude towards the South Korean government is due to reports from the British Consulate and other sources, all stating that the situation in South Korea is quite unstable. The reports all point out that South Korea is in turmoil, and farmers, students, and some intellectuals are opposing Rhee Syngman's "fascist dictatorship." In addition, South Korea has more than 400 political parties, which also seems to be a symbol of chaos. Some reports even point out that the election was completed in terror and fraud. Finally, although the situation in the Soviet-occupied zone of North Korea is unclear, various reports received here indicate that a small number of Koreans are currently fleeing from South Korea to North Korea.</p>
<h3>US Loans to Korea Could Reach $100 Million Next Year</h3>
<p>Rhee Syngman Sends Telegram Thanking US for Recognizing Korea</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] According to the most reliable sources, senior officials are currently meeting to discuss whether the State Department or the Economic Cooperation Administration will take over the administration of the aid to Korea plan and the funds that have not yet been used. The government estimates that the total amount of aid to Korea could reach as high as $100 million by the end of the accounting year next June. This number is based on the estimated amount that may be left over from the funds allocated to Korea by the Department of the Army out of the $130 million in occupied area expenses at that time. Authoritative sources believe that Korea will probably be incorporated into the aid to China plan.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The message from President Rhee Syngman of the new government of the two countries to US President Truman thanking him has been released here today.

<h3>Stalin and Tito's Struggle (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by this newspaper's editorial office (Original article published in the July 9th issue of "U.S. News &amp; World Report" magazine)</p>
<p>Nationalistic animosities existing among satellite states are deeply rooted and gradually weaken the strong front that the Soviet Union wants to show the West. Territorial disputes have estranged Poles and Czechs, Yugoslavs and Bulgarians, and even the Italian and Austrian Communist parties from the Yugoslavs. The Poles, Czechs, and Yugoslavs need a weak Germany, but the German Communist Party, supported by Moscow, demands a strong Germany.</p>
<p>As these nationalistic, political, and economic oppressions intensify day by day, the Soviet Union's greatest gain in World War II, namely Moscow's control over its new Eastern European security zone, will face increasingly severe difficulties. Yugoslavia's current betrayal may trigger unrest elsewhere in the future.</p>
<p>Tito's actions have punctured the paper tiger of the Kremlin's iron curtain. Even if Yugoslavia's loophole is patched up, the Soviet bloc may no longer be as strong and united as it was last year, enough to confront the West. Revealing the inside story of Yugoslavia can clarify why the Soviet Union is having disputes with its bloc. The Yugoslav crisis began to exist six months ago. Last winter, an economic panic struck Yugoslavia, hindering the progress of the Five-Year Plan. The grain produced by farmers was insufficient to meet demand, and materials rationed to consumers were diverted to the black market; production lagged behind the planned targets. To date, the Soviet Union has not been able to supply Yugoslavia with the machinery necessary for industrialization.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav Communist Party experienced internal disagreements regarding the strategies to be adopted for solving the above-mentioned problems. A divided faction emerged under the leadership of two members of Tito's seven-man Politburo. Both of these men had fought alongside Marshal Tito in the guerrilla war during World War II. One was Hebrang, the current chairman of the National Planning Commission, the highest economic position in Yugoslavia. The other was Zhujović, who had served as the deputy commander of the student guerrilla brigade under Marshal Tito. Apart from Tito, Zhujović was one of the most popular leaders in Yugoslavia, and he was also a good friend of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.</p>
<p>These two dissenters urged Tito to accelerate the implementation of collective farms and the nationalization of retail businesses and small industries. Tito's followers rejected these proposals, insisting that agriculture must gradually be socialized, and that since large-scale industries had already been nationalized, there was no need to rush to take over small factories and retail businesses.</p>
<p>Indirect Interference by the Soviet Union</p>
<p>After a long time, the Soviet Union began to indirectly interfere in the dispute. The Yugoslav secret police discovered that Soviet agents were recruiting Communist Party members as spies and were encouraging other party members to support the faction of Zhujović and Hebrang. The Yugoslav security police, OZMA, intensified surveillance of Soviet officials.</p>
<p>Members of Tito's group began to criticize the Soviet Union for failing to provide economic assistance, and also made many criticisms of other Soviet policies, and there were suggestions to request assistance from the Western powers in the form of trade and loans.</p>
<p>However, economic problems were soon overshadowed by the question of "Moscow's rule or Belgrade's rule."</p>
<p>Despite having Moscow's backing, the opposition leaders were eventually forced to stop their dissenting arguments. In January, economic authority Hebrang was demoted to Minister of Industry, but Zhujović was promoted to the important post of Lieutenant General, presumably to gain his support.</p>
<p>On March 20, the Soviet Union directly applied pressure to Tito's faction. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party sent a letter to the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, using harsh language and supporting the faction of Zhujović and Hebrang. The letter accused Tito of stifling internal party debate, and the Communist parties of Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, under the direction of the Soviet Union, also sent letters to Tito making similar accusations.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Open Investigation Committee Established; Electricity to be Examined First; Notices Sent to Companies to Submit Income Statements and Other Information for Review</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Public Utilities Open Investigation and Review Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu attended, as well as city councilors Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Qu Yue, Li Wenjie, and Shao Yongsheng; representatives from the Public Utilities Bureau (Zhao Zengjue), the Social Affairs Bureau (Zhang Chude), the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (Yan Zusheng), the Accountants Association (He Yuanming), the Federation of Labor Unions (Ye Xianggao), the Municipal Industries Association (Tian Heqing), and the Engineers Association (You XunZhao), totaling thirteen representatives from nine organizations (Pan Mingshin of the Electrical Engineers Association was absent). Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Shen Zonglian, Secretary-General of the City Council Xiang Changquan, and Municipal Government Advisor Lin Duxin were in attendance. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, first clarifying the meaning and tasks of establishing the Open Investigation and Review Committee. He stated: "Various sectors have many doubts about the income and expenditure of public utility companies, as well as the relationship between the municipal government and these companies. I suggested that the City Council organize a review committee. Following the City Council's resolution, the municipal government is responsible for organizing it. I believe that the most pressing issues for discussion today are: (1) How should the investigation and review be conducted to be appropriate? (2) What kind of public review method should be adopted?"</p>
<p>Li Wenjie suggested the following information for the investigation, divided into two parts: (1) Currently available information, such as the Public Utilities Investigation Report from the Public Utilities Bureau and the City Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' amended Public Utilities Price Calculation Explanation, resolutions from the City Council's temporary assembly, and the Public Utilities Price Investigation Explanation from August, etc. (2) Information to be collected: Income statements from each company for January to June of this year, and reports on how each company determined its fixed base. Li stated that the work of the review committee is very arduous, and time constraints should be considered, with all review work to be completed by the end of this month. He advocated that transportation, telephone, electricity, gas, water, and other sectors should be reviewed separately, and the financial, engineering, and accounting heads of each company should be invited to participate in the explanation during the review. It is estimated that completing all the work will require more than ten meetings of the review committee.</p>
<p>Assistance to Companies in Difficulty</p>
<p>Director Zhao expressed agreement with Li's opinion that each public utility should be reviewed separately, as there are six power companies, five water companies, two telephone companies, two tram companies, two bus companies, and two gas companies in the city, as well as city ferries and small train companies, making the organization quite complex and the review time-consuming. He believes that in the current period of suppression of rebellion, the current policy for public utilities should be to maintain their continuous operation as a prerequisite. The attitude towards each company should be: "If a company has difficulties, we will assist in solving them to the best of our ability. If we cannot solve them, we must provide a full explanation to convince them." Director Zhao indicated that the bureau has specialized personnel from all departments of public utility companies available for questioning during the review.</p>
<p>Subsequently, You XunZhao, Qu Yue, Shao Yongsheng, Jiang Haoran, and others expressed their opinions, unanimously agreeing that the task of the review committee is to review the actual expenditures and that reasonable requests based on facts should be accepted. The review method must be completely open.</p>
<h3>Two Resolutions from the Meeting</h3>
<p>After discussion, it was resolved: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau will notify each company to submit their actual monthly income and expenditure statements from January to June of this year, monthly raw material consumption figures, monthly inventory statistics of major materials (including July), and balance sheets of each company to the Public Utilities Open Investigation and Review Committee within three days for review. (2) The electricity sector will be reviewed first at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month. The review dates for other items will be decided by engineering experts and the Public Utilities Bureau after consultation with the companies.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Price Reduction Ratio Calculated, to be Announced Within Days</h3>
<p>[Dagon News Agency] Regarding the reduction of new prices for public utilities in August, the Municipal Public Transportation Company's buses and city ferries have already reduced prices starting yesterday. The price reduction ratios for water, electricity, telephone, buses, trams, and small trains have also been calculated and determined by the Public Utilities Bureau in accordance with the price reduction method resolved by the City Council, and will be announced after the mayor makes a final decision today. The price reductions for trams, buses, and small trains will be implemented within days. It is learned that the price reduction ratios for each item are: water 20%, telephone and gas 15%, buses 20%, trams 1st class 20% to 28.6%, 3rd class 15% to 20%, and small trains 20%.</p>
<h3>Air-Conditioned Express Train Fiercely Criticized by Supervisory Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The operation of air-conditioned express trains on the Nanjing-Shanghai route was fiercely criticized at the first meeting of the Transportation Committee of the Supervisory Yuan on the 18th. The attending members agreed that transportation should prioritize the welfare of the public, and that the national financial resources are currently depleted. The Railway Bureau should not only be unable to economize on expenses, but instead create novelties, spending huge sums to build air-conditioned trains, exclusively for the enjoyment of the wealthy, which is inappropriate for the times. Government subsidies for transportation should only be made under absolutely necessary circumstances, as transportation itself needs to reduce unnecessary expenses as much as possible, and only then should the government subsidize it.</p>
<h3>Hotel Representatives Petition for Increased Water and Electricity Surcharges</h3>
<p>Director Wu Promises to Submit for Discussion</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] More than 30 representatives from labor and management of the city's hotel industry went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to petition, and were received by Director Wu. They stated that the hotel room rates had increased by 95% this time, but this did not include the additional water and electricity fees. They requested to collect an additional fee outside the room rate. The Social Affairs Bureau did not approve this, and the hotel industry felt it was difficult to maintain operations. They explained the difficulties faced by the industry after the increase in water and electricity fees to Director Wu. Director Wu promised to submit the request for discussion at the municipal government meeting and notify the Public Utilities Bureau to inform the water and electricity companies that if the hotels are unable to pay the water and electricity fees, they should not stop the water and electricity supply, but allow them to postpone payment.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Allocated to Public Employees Still Unsold at Five Factories</h3>
<p>Hoping Those Who Haven't Claimed Them Will Do So Quickly</p>
<p>According to the Fuel Management Committee, the total number of coal briquettes allocated to public employees in this city is approximately 110,000 dan. The committee prepares approximately 120,000 dan for allocation each month, so there is always a surplus each month, and there is no shortage of allocation. However, because the coal briquette factories distributing the allocations are located in all districts of the city, totaling 50, the factories in the central district, with their convenient locations, have higher demand, so they sell out earlier each time. The factories in the southwest district always have a surplus due to fewer people claiming them. The addresses of the factories that have not yet sold out this period are listed below, so that those who have not claimed them can do so quickly to avoid loss due to expiration: Xinfu, 1030 Guihua Road. Yuedong, Lane 61, 300 Yichang Road. Xinghua, 1410 Nanshi Wai Ma Road. Yuanhua, A25 Anyuan Road. Beiyang, 1302 Anyuan Road.</p>

<h3>Fire at Naval Medical Depot; Cause of Fire Unknown; Losses Cannot Be Estimated</h3>
<p>[East China News Agency] Following the explosion at the Joint Logistics Department ammunition depot, a fire suddenly broke out at the Naval Hygiene Materials General Depot at 2181 North Sichuan Road in this city at around 7:00 AM yesterday. The Central Fire Department of the Police Bureau urgently dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire, which was extinguished after half an hour. The General Depot has 72 warehouses of various sizes, fully stocked with pharmaceuticals and medical equipment left by the Japanese Navy. It is usually heavily guarded, with no entry for outsiders. Except for office hours from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the depot gates are always closed, and no one stays overnight. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, thick smoke suddenly emerged from room number 10 on the second floor of the depot. After discovering this, they urgently opened the door for rescue, but the fire had already spread. Fire trucks arrived one after another, and the fire was gradually brought under control after five minutes. Fortunately, it was extinguished after half an hour, with only warehouse number 230 being burned down. It was found that warehouse number 230 stored 40 types of pharmaceuticals, most of which were aspirin, potassium permanganate, calcium chloride and other injectables. Ten types of pharmaceuticals were rescued during the fire. The cause of the fire could not be determined immediately. According to the depot chief, Chen Ende, it may have been caused by potassium permanganate heating up and gasifying. The total loss cannot be estimated at this time. Chen Ende, the depot chief, had just taken office on August 1, and has now submitted a list of losses to the Naval Headquarters.</p>

The foreign exchange settlement certificate has also increased from 3 million U.S. dollars to 7.75 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 158%, so the fares have not been able to keep up with the oil and exchange rates. In the future, before the government has any control and stabilization measures for oil and exchange rates, the two companies will raise fares at any time.</p>

<p>The National Defense Ministry's Shanghai-based agency received a tip on the 10th of this month that Xu Xiaoyu, the "Commander of the Zhejiang People's Guerrilla Liberation Army" of Rong Island, Zhoushan, had sent "Chief of the Quartermaster Department" Chen Bangrong to transport looted materials, including 13 large boxes of Western medicine and 800 dan of table salt, to Tianshenggang, Nantong, on a large sailboat, where they were stored at the Xiangfeng Salt Company, awaiting an opportunity to be transported to the Communist Bandit area in northern Jiangsu in exchange for military supplies. The agency sent personnel to the Xiangfeng Salt Company together with the First Pacification Zone Command to seize the materials and arrest the bandits Chen Bangrong, Yu Zhongtong, Yu Zhongyao, Chen Zhi, and Zhang Pinsheng, the deputy manager of the Xiangfeng Salt Company. They are currently under interrogation.</p>

<h3>Chen Qilong's Remains to be Encoffined Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The news of the passing of Chen Qilong, a remnant elder of the deposed Qing Dynasty, was already reported in yesterday's newspaper. Chen was a Jinshi graduate of the Bingxu year (1886) and served as a Principal of the Ministry of War and a Secretary of the Zongli Yamen (Office for General Management) during the late Qing Dynasty. He was successively promoted to Associate Director of the Ministry of War, then selected as a Vice Minister of the Grand Secretariat, and then Prefect and Magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture. At the time of the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year (1900), he remained in Beijing and accompanied Li Hongzhang in negotiating peace with the foreign powers. For his contributions, he was appointed as the Henan Provincial Administration Commissioner but did not take office, and was then promoted to Director-General of Water Transport, and then successively transferred to Governor of Henan, Governor of Jiangsu, Governor-General of Sichuan, and Governor-General of Huguang, and finally served as Minister of Beiyang and Governor-General of Zhili. Before the Revolution of 1911 (Xinhai Revolution), he preemptively requested retirement, with Zhang Zhenfang, the Zhili Linyun Envoy in charge of seals of office, acting as his replacement. Within days, the edict of abdication of the Qing Emperor was issued. Afterwards, he retired to Shanghai, indulging in poetry and books for more than thirty years. Before the age of eighty, he occasionally traveled to Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shandong, and Hebei, recording his travels in poetry. Thus, he accumulated dozens of volumes of manuscripts, among which the published ones include "Songshoutang Poetry Manuscripts," "Huajinlou Poetry Manuscripts," and "Mingyuan Collection" and other compilations. Chen was already ninety-two years old this year, and was one of the most respected elders of the deposed Qing Dynasty in terms of both age and rank. People from the north such as Wang Kemin were all his disciples, but Chen maintained his integrity, and during the period of occupation, he never interacted with the enemy or puppet regimes. Therefore, when the Chairman first came to Shanghai for inspection after the victory of the War of Resistance, he personally visited Chen's residence to express his condolences. He passed away this time due to a minor illness, and his students and former colleagues all mourn in unison, as his modesty and great virtue were deeply touching. Chen's remains are scheduled to be encoffined at his residence at No. 157 Jiangyin Road at 3:00 PM today. The attached photo is a portrait of Chen taken by photographer Lang Jingshan this spring.</p>
<h3>Public Trial of Okamura Can be Heard Nationwide, Broadcast via Radio Station at the Time; Spectator Seats Limited to 400</h3>
<p>General Yasuji Okamura, a Japanese war criminal, will be publicly tried on the 23rd at the auditorium of the Municipal Council. The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense specially dispatched two adjutants to inspect the venue and plan necessary arrangements yesterday afternoon. Originally, it was planned to set up 1,000 spectator seats for the public trial. Due to space limitations, it has been decided to reduce this to 400 seats. Ambassadors from various countries in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai, will be invited to attend, so the issuance of spectator passes will be strictly limited. However, the Military Tribunal believes that the historic scene of Okamura's public trial will surely be of concern to the entire nation. To compensate for the shortcomings of the limited seating, in addition to planning to install loudspeakers in the main streets near the Municipal Council to broadcast the trial proceedings to the public, it has also been decided to use the Xindu Radio Station (call sign XLST, wavelength 1200 KC), which is run by the Municipal Council, to simultaneously broadcast to the entire nation.</p>

<h3>Beer Factory Owner Murder Case: Main Suspect Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Hongkou Police Precinct received a tip-off the day before yesterday that bandits were hiding in Room No. XX of the New Oriental Hotel at No. 35 Dekang Lane, No. 22 Qiujiang Road. Xu Shibin, the head of the Criminal Division, ordered his officers Ying Rumo and Gu Zhongshu to lead police to the scene, where they arrested two robbers on the spot and confiscated a pistol. According to their confession, one was named Zhou Hongsheng, twenty years old, who used to work as a staff member at the Nanjing Yumin Monthly Magazine. He was later dismissed for some reason. Recently, he learned that Sun Youbo, the editor of Yumin, had come to Shanghai from Nanjing, carrying a self-provided pistol, and was staying at Room 107 of the New Shanghai Hotel in Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road. He used the excuse of visiting Sun to steal the gun and then joined forces with the notorious bandit Wang Jianfu (the other arrested criminal) to commit robberies in the western part of Shanghai. After further interrogation of Wang, the officer in charge, Wang confessed to numerous crimes, and also confessed to being the main culprit in the murder of the German owner of the Ewo Brewery. The precinct believes Wang has committed numerous crimes, so they have applied to the District Procuratorate for detention in order to continue the investigation.</p>
<h3>Poor People's Rice Ration Certificates Cannot be Used Alone</h3>
<p>The Civil Food Allocation Association, due to receiving a letter from citizen Zhang Jintang, expressing a lack of clarity regarding the usage of rice rationing regulations, specifically reiterated that the purpose of providing rice at subsidized prices is to provide discounted rates to the poor who are unable to afford rice. The issued rice ration certificates should be used together with the household rice ration certificates when purchasing rice from rice stores and cannot be used alone in order to avoid double benefits.</p>
<h3>The First Time in Three Hundred Years: Heroes from All Walks of Life Gather in One Place; Stunts and Acrobatic Skills Abound at the Tianchan Stage National Martial Arts Competition</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] For the past few days, there has been a National Martial Arts Competition performance at the Tianchan Stage every afternoon. It is organized by the Northeast Branch of the Central Martial Arts Academy to promote national martial arts, starting from the opening on the 16th and lasting until the 21st. Yesterday was the third day of the performance.</p>
<p>The host of the competition is Lieutenant General Li Daheng, the director of the Northeast Branch of the Central Martial Arts Academy. The sponsors include Bishop Yu Bin, Zhang Zhijiang, the director of the Central Martial Arts Academy, and Zhang Fang, a legislator from Henan. Twenty-one national martial arts and combat groups are participating. It is said that a situation like this, where "heroes from all walks of life gather in one place," is the first time since the three hundred years of the Manchu Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the performing units included five martial arts associations: Huashe, Hualian, Jingwu, Qunying, and Yuzhong. The performances included various boxing styles and various weapons. The nature of the performances included solo, doubles, and one-against-two matches. In addition to knives, spears, swords, and halberds, the types of weapons included the crescent shovel, pilgrim staff, and nine-section whip. The martial arts included styles such as Gongli Boxing, Huaquan, Single Knife vs. Spear, Yan Qing Drunk, and Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl. It can be said to be a dazzling array, a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>White-Haired镖师 (Dart Thrower)　Unchanged Complexion After Finishing Boxing Set</p>
<p>It is really difficult for outsiders to judge the level of skill and the depth of expertise. The audience's cheers mostly focused on the energetic scenes of fighting and grappling. Whenever weapons clanged on stage, shouts were heard, and the stage vibrated with the force, dust flying, cheers would erupt from the audience. However, at this time, the "experts" among the judges on the stage may not necessarily show approval. It is said that the quality of martial arts should be judged by whether the feet are firmly planted, whether the movements are quick and powerful, and whether the eyes are bright. If any of these three are missing, the skill has not yet reached the level.</p>
<p>In one of the programs, an elderly man with white hair, nearly seventy years old, performed. In the combination of falling, tumbling, and turning, his skills were extraordinary. After finishing a set of boxing, his complexion remained unchanged. This old man is said to be Cai Guiqin, the leader of the Hualian Martial Arts Association. In his youth, he was a镖师 (Dart Thrower), making a name for himself in the greenwood of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. He is so old and yet still so strong, which shows the effectiveness of martial arts in strengthening the body and prolonging life.</p>
<p>Six-Year-Old Child Performs　Actually Possesses Complete Form</p>
<p>Comparable to this old镖师 (Dart Thrower) was a six-year-old child from the Yuzhong Martial Arts Association. He is probably less than two feet tall, but when he performs, he actually possesses complete form. His Monkey Fist and Drunken Fist are not only lifelike in expression but also methodical. Several somersaults with his head not touching the ground were even more crisp and clean. This child is starting to practice at such a young age, so his skill will be truly immeasurable when he grows up.</p>
<p>In the way of martial arts, there are distinctions between the Shaolin, Wudang, Kunlun, Emei, Tianshan, Solun, and Guandong schools. I remember when I was a child reading martial arts novels, I was fascinated and privately yearned for the heroic figures, sword immortals, and chivalrous warriors depicted in them. When I grew older and gained more knowledge, I realized that this era had long passed, and guns and bombs had replaced fists, knives, and halberds. However, as an exercise for strengthening the body and the race, martial arts itself still has its value.</p>
<p>If We Want to Strengthen the Body and Strengthen the Nation　We Must Promote Martial Arts</p>
<p>According to Lieutenant General Li, the host of the competition, the way of martial arts emphasizes the circulation of qi. The internal problems of the body must be addressed before one can practice kung fu. This is where martial arts is superior to Western sports, because Western sports only seek muscle development. He said that before the Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people paid great attention to martial skills. At that time, their physique was much taller and stronger than it is now, and the average lifespan was also much longer than it is now. Unfortunately, after the Manchus took over, due to ulterior motives, they emphasized literature and devalued martial arts. As a result, national martial arts declined, and the physique of the Chinese people became weaker and weaker. He believes that if we want to strengthen the body and strengthen the nation, we must promote martial arts.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Li himself is very accomplished in practicing qigong. Yesterday, he showed it to reporters, and when a stream of qi was directed to his abdomen, it swelled up like a fully inflated soccer ball. In today's program of the martial arts competition, he will personally perform a set. Tong Zhongyi, who served as a martial arts judge at the National Games, will also show his skills on stage today.</p>

<h3>Wealthy Merchant Accused of Being a Traitor, Deng Zhonghe Hosts Reporters, Considers Letter from Wan Lihlang to Him to be Forged; Mayor Solemnly Declares the Accusation is Unrelated to Special Donations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Zhengwen, a member of the Agriculture and Labor Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, has accused Deng Zhonghe, a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, of being a traitor to the High Procuratorate. In addition to the ongoing investigation by the judicial authorities, both parties have been publishing announcements in various newspapers in recent days, making their respective statements. First, Deng Zhonghe accused Zhu Zhengwen of being an "extortion bandit" because he had attempted to extort him twice without success, forging documents, and falsely accusing him of being a traitor out of spite. Zhu Zhengwen then published an announcement yesterday, stating that he had accused Deng Zhonghe of being a traitor and had collected various solid evidence. He said that Deng's accusation that he was an "extortion bandit" was a slanderous attack, which constituted criminal liability, and he would separately pursue legal action. After seeing the report, Deng Zhonghe published announcements in various newspapers today, refuting Zhu Zhengwen's announcement, calling it "all lies and exaggerations, demonstrating the abilities of a village woman scolding in the streets." Deng also publicly hosted reporters yesterday to report on this incident and the issue of special relief donations. In addition to pointing out that Zhu had extorted him twice, he also stated that the reason Zhu accused him of being a traitor was based on a letter from Wan Lihlang, who had been executed, to him. The gist of the letter was that he had donated 50,000 military blankets to Wan Lihlang's troops and 150,000 military blankets to Deng's troops during the period of enemy occupation, so he could obtain cotton control rights. He believes that this letter is a forgery.</p>
<p>Regarding the special relief donation, according to Deng, his Anle Textile Factory, in addition to having been transferred three times by the Wool Spinning, Cotton Spinning, and Dyeing and Weaving Associations at the end of last month, he also pledged to donate 50 billion when he met with Mayor Wu on the 4th of this month. As for the photo of the Wan Lihlang letter shown by the mayor, he believes that it was also delivered by Zhu, with the aim of malicious propaganda.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Committee Proceeds to Investigate Deng Zhonghe's Assets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited Mayor Wu to inquire about Deng Zhonghe's donation fundraising situation. Mayor Wu replied that there were still no results. After Mayor Wu had negotiated with Deng Zhonghe several times, Deng only agreed to donate 50 billion yuan, which was a far cry from the target set by the Fundraising Committee, so the committee decided not to accept it. The Fundraising Committee has now begun to investigate Deng's assets.</p>
<h3>Mayor Admits to Showing Photo</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumor that the accusation of Deng Zhonghe being a traitor was related to the special relief donation, Mayor Wu solemnly denied it. He said that Deng Zhonghe received a letter from Zhu Zhengwen after being accused, listing Deng's inferior acts as a traitor, but he did not know Zhu Zhengwen. Moreover, Deng was accused very early, and the court had already been secretly investigating him. As for the fact that Mayor Wu had shown Deng Zhonghe a photo of the Wan Lihlang letter, Wu said that the photo was forwarded by a committee member, and he had repeatedly received reports from various parties accusing Deng Zhonghe of making a fortune from the national crisis, which was in line with the special donation fundraising standards set by the central government. He showed him the photo to persuade him to voluntarily donate.</p>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the progress of the special relief donation. He said that those currently being pursued were all notoriously stingy wealthy individuals. He firmly believed that once this hurdle was overcome, other problems could be easily resolved.</p>

<h3>Ironclad Evidence of Communist Spies Orchestrating Student Unrest Continued from Page Two</h3>
<p>(4) Inciting the "June 2nd" Student Unrest, Plotting the "Three Strikes and One Tragedy" in Vain: Just as students in various regions were gradually awakening and patriotic school protection movements were successively unfolding, forcing the conspiracies of communist spy students to subside, the Communist Youth League Central Committee was greatly alarmed. It secretly ordered communist spy students in various schools to intensify the creation of sudden student unrest, and launched the so-called "Three Strikes and One Tragedy Movement." It was predetermined that the Communist Party's "Anti-War Day," June 2nd, would be the general mobilization day for a total student strike, demonstration, and parade in the valley. After deliberation by communist spy student representatives from various student federations gathered in Nanjing, they were separately notified to schools to get the communist spy students to fully promote the "June 21st General Strike and Parade." Fortunately, the security authorities in various regions solemnly declared their determination to prevent it closely and various reasonable guidance, forcing communist spy students in various regions to successively abandon their "Three Strikes and One Tragedy" attempts on "June 2nd." The day actually appeared particularly peaceful everywhere.</p>
<p>(5) The Conspiracy Surrounding Yu Zisan's Suicide: On October 23rd, the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications authorities discovered a letter from Huang Xianlin, a third-year student in the Agronomy Department of Zhejiang University, sent from Shanghai to Yu Zisan, the director of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association. The letter stated that Huang was dispatched to Shanghai by Yu to participate in the Communist Student Federation, and reported to Yu that his superiors had sent Huang Shimin and Chen Jianxin to Hangzhou to guide the brewing of the "Anti-Mobilization Order" and to strive for the work of student self-government associations in various schools. Yu was asked to go to the train station on the 25th to meet them. Thereupon, the security authorities made prior arrangements and simultaneously apprehended Yu, Huang, Chen, and another person in charge of a reading group, Li Bojin, in the hotel. Communist books, documents, lists, and other secret documents were seized on the spot and transferred by the security authorities to the court for investigation. Unexpectedly, the suspect Yu, fearing punishment and attempting to frame the government, took advantage of the guards' negligence and committed suicide by slitting his own throat. As a result, under the instigation of communist spy students at Zhejiang University, committees for "Handling Funeral Arrangements," "Rescuing," and "Accusing" were established, brewing a large-scale student unrest. Students at Tsinghua and Peking University in Beiping, incited by communist spies, also went on strike in response. Fortunately, the fact of Yu's suicide was publicly proven, and the authorities provided effective guidance. Although the funeral once stirred up trouble, it did not lead to a major incident.</p>
<p>(6) The Deliberately Launched "May 21st" Incident: Communist spy students at National Central University in Nanjing originally attempted to create an "incident" on the "May Fourth" Memorial Day. As a result, they failed to achieve their goal due to insufficient mass support. Subsequently, the planned evening party on "May 20th" was blocked by the Greater Nanjing Student Federation. Thereupon, they changed the date to the evening of "May 21st." At this evening party, the program performed was as extreme as possible in insulting the head of state and slandering the government, causing dissatisfaction and serious protests from some students who were stirred by righteous indignation. Unexpectedly, the armed pickets organized by communist spy students actually beat and humiliated the audience and privately tortured Li Zhimin and Ni Yuwen, two students from Central University. As a result, after the evening party, two communist spy students from Central University were dragged to the Garrison Headquarters by the angry and indignant audience. Unexpectedly, they were mistakenly sent to the Youth Department, which refused to accept them and sent them to the police department for transfer to the Garrison Headquarters. Later, the Dean of Students of Central University took them back that night. Thereupon, communist spy students used this as an excuse to go on strike for one day on May 22nd, held a demonstration, and surrounded the Youth Department, making unreasonable demands. Various extremely insulting and slanderous slogans and banners were scribbled on the walls of the Youth Department. Finally, thanks to the calm handling by Minister Chen of the Youth Department, no trouble was caused. However, the rampant nature of communist spy students and their lawless disruptive actions were evident here.</p>
<p>3. Recent Communist Student Movement Conspiracies and Summer Vacation Work</p>
<p>In order to coordinate with the expansion of military rebellion, the Communist Party is trying to make student unrest the core of urban disturbances, use schools as concessions to cultivate rebel cadres, and lure and coerce them to engage in armed riots in rural areas. According to documents seized from the Communist Party instructing communist spy students, the basic task of the Communist Party's student movement this year is to "fundamentally and rapidly and advantageously shake and destroy the rule of the reactionaries." The document puts forward five basic strategies for the Communist Party's student movement this year:</p>
<p>(1) The old forms of student movement must be abandoned, and all possible and favorable conditions must be used flexibly.</p>
<p>(2) Emphasize the effect of propaganda and education and avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>(3) Attack compromiseism and defeatism, and correct blind actionism.</p>
<p>(4) Strengthen the connection between the city and the whole country to avoid being defeated one by one.</p>
<p>(5) Be prepared to attack at any time and do not be satisfied with small victories.</p>
<p>Therefore, the formulation of its basic student movement plan lists items such as starting from doing a good job in homework and living with classmates, from shallow to deep, from near to far, from small to large, from low to high, inside and outside the school, stepping up efforts, and welcoming the new upsurge.</p>
<p>The focus of work specified by the internal and external projects of the school is:</p>
<p>"The focus of student work should be placed inside the school, and the development and purpose of the struggle should be pushed outside the school to the ocean of the people. In the school, we should gradually improve the students' awareness and closely unite the students' strength. In the work, we should cultivate cadres, forge cadres, and lay a deeper and more solid foundation to establish the central fortress of the student movement, and then gradually promote it and continuously transport a large number of cadres to the outside of the school to support the work of other backward departments, resolutely step into the ocean of the people and the main force of the revolution, combine with workers and peasants, strive for the liberation of the people, and complete the glorious historical task, but the transportation is not uprooting, and it is not only to demand materials but not to plant seedlings, but to transport with a plan in a large number of cultivation, speed up the cultivation and continuously transport to maintain the balance of the development of the student movement."</p>
<p>The central work in the project of stepping up efforts to meet the new upsurge is:</p>
<p>"Revolutionary history has proved that the vast majority of great engineers, writers, scientists, politicians, and politicians are forged from the most acute and intense struggle, not from greenhouses that are divorced from actual struggle, so in addition to the need to constantly carry out current affairs learning, spread the situation after the great counter-offensive of the Liberation Army, the suffering of the people and the crisis of the dictator, the happy life of the people in the liberated areas, the specific policies of the Liberation Army, the development of the patriotic democratic movement, and the prospects of the new democratic China, we must also strive to learn about rural and peasant knowledge, learn the skills to serve the peasants and organize peasant struggles, understand the ideology, and be ready to go to the countryside at any time to accept the new upsurge of the revolution."</p>
<p>It is enough to prove that the Communist Party is trying to make the student unrest blend with its military rebellion in order to actively support the conspiracy of the Communist Party to destroy the national order and massacre innocent people.</p>
<p>In terms of application, the Communist Party's instructions are: to consider the objective environment and subjective conditions, and to adopt various forms of "illegal struggle" and "legal struggle" respectively, and in order to implement its strategy of "each student unrest is the forging, review and preparation for the next student unrest", to carry out the stage of rectification and preparation between its "campaigns" and "campaigns", brewing the so-called "fundamentally and rapidly and advantageously shake and destroy the rule of the reactionaries" of the "new upsurge of the student movement", which is manifested in the summer vacation work as follows:</p>
<p>After the beginning of the summer vacation, the Communist Party's pseudo "National Student Federation" has temporarily stopped plotting large-scale student unrest across the country, and has turned to the stage of consolidating the plans and deployments to wait for the opportunity to rise again, the reasons for which are:</p>
<p>(1) Accepting the instructions of the Huadong Branch of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(2) Schools are on vacation, and most students are dispersed.</p>
<p>(4) During the student unrest in April, May and June, cadres and organizations were too exposed and needed to be adjusted urgently.</p>
<p>According to the Communist Party's Huadong Bureau (the scope of activities is Subei, Sunan and the area west of the Jinpu Road in Anhui Province) recently secretly issued an instruction on the "New Direction of the Student Movement in the Current Stage", the main points are briefly stated as follows:</p>
<p>"The government is stepping up repression, and the student movement is facing greater hardships and difficulties. Two deviations must be corrected: (1) The tendency to be too left, and to continue to engage in large-scale mass actions, without grasping the principle of "reasonable and beneficial and expensive", without taking into account the government's inevitable blows, resulting in unnecessary losses: (1) The tendency to be too right, and to hide passively and wait blindly. Although difficulties have increased, if we can correctly estimate the objective environment and fully grasp the party's route, we can still overcome them. The direction of the student movement in the current stage should be: (1) Concentrate our forces, and strike at a certain point in a hierarchical manner, expand the united front, and narrow the scope of attack, so as to avoid being isolated in the movement, (2) Consolidate the existing positions, and carry out decentralized operations, from near to far, from inside to outside, and gradually develop, with the determination of long-term hard work and the method of steady fighting, accumulating strength little by little, preparing strength, and welcoming the climax, (3) All mass movements, take life struggle and economic struggle as an opportunity, wait for the opportunity to mature, and quickly turn into political struggle, and timely put forward the slogans of anti-American imperialism and anti-× rule. (4) Coordinate the daily economic interests of the broad youth with the long-term political interests, combine the "patriotic democracy" work with daily life, and establish mass relations and foundations from the collective solution of life problems and learning problems," etc.</p>
<p>Based on the above instructions: the pseudo "Shanghai Student Federation" has held several meetings in early July to determine its summer vacation work policy as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Stop large-scale actions temporarily, preserve strength, and reorganize and consolidate the organization.</p>
<p>(2) Return from political struggle to students' own interests struggle (life, economy, learning).</p>
<p>(3) Disperse and go deep into the society and the countryside to conduct investigation, liaison and propaganda to establish the basis for the cooperation of the student movement and the social movement.</p>
<p>The above three items are related to the application of the Communist Party's phrase "step by step and strategically". From the reorganization of the organization, the transformation of the content and method of struggle, to the planting of seeds and the deployment of forces for the new student unrest in the next semester.</p>
<p>Regarding the students' action principles and the deployment of the student unrest in the next semester, the pseudo "Student Federation" has put forward three slogans: (1) "Individual Liberation" (referring to sneaking into the Communist area), (2) "Joint Defense in School", (3) "Collective Return to Hometown", the following are the manifestations of the activities in various places: (1) Regarding the unity of students: such as running summer tutoring schools, reading clubs, typing training classes, lectures, travel groups, investigating the employment situation of graduates and determining the liaison method, running candidate service groups... etc. (2) Regarding the reorganization of the organization: temporarily suspending the recruitment of new members, stepping up the anesthetization of middle school students, extensively expanding new peripheral groups (such as running small journalist training classes), arranging the "Student Federation" members of this year's high school graduates, and planning to take the entrance examinations of national and private universities in order to become new cadres in major colleges and universities in the next semester. The Communist Party has also established a branch within the pseudo "National Student Federation" to strengthen control and manipulation. (3) Regarding the decentralized development of social activities that instigate rebellion: such as running literacy classes and free night schools, conducting rural visits, taking the opportunity to promote "anti-supporting Japan, anti-drawing Ding, anti-collecting reality" to citizens and peasants, and compiling various "living reports" and singing.</p>
<p>4. The Truth about the Communist Party's Mass Inducement of Young Students to Sneak into the Communist Area</p>
<p>It can be seen from the above that the Communist Party is painstakingly plotting a glimpse of the conspiracy to deploy the new student unrest in the next semester. However, what must be paid special attention to is the phenomenon of a large number of communist spy students sneaking into the Communist area this summer vacation. Its nature can be divided into: (1) The Communist Party transferred back for training, preparing to send back again, (2) The face is exposed, fleeing to escape punishment, (3) Bewitched by the Communist Party's slogan of "welcome to participate in the construction work of the liberated area", being induced to go, (4) Fantasizing about the life of "revolutionary armed struggle", being induced to participate in the armed riots in the rural areas behind the government.</p>
<p>The above two items (1) and (4) are part of the Communist Party's conspiracy to strengthen "urban work" and "rural work" behind the government, while the two items (2) and (3) belong to the conspiracy of "Communist area work", so the entire activities of the Communist Party are using Communist-ified youth as a source of manpower, and one of the basic goals of the Communist Party's "student movement" is to "cultivate rebel cadres through actual actions". The following are reliable evidence of the various situations of professional students sneaking into the Communist area recently:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the transfer and training of cadres to strengthen "urban work": the Communist Party recently received instructions from the pseudo-central government, ordering "a large-scale expansion of urban work across the country, and drawing a large number of workers to study in the urban work department and then assigning them to work in various places... Everyone is inciting the masses in the heart of the enemy's rear, striving for the middle forces, doing a good job in underground work, preparing for the situation to come..." Therefore, the urban work departments of the Communist Party in various places have recently been mobilizing cadres for training, including student movement cadres. Communist Party students in colleges and universities in Shanghai mostly used the name of "summer sightseeing" as a cover, and transferred to Tianjin and Qingdao in two places, and then sneaked into the Communist area for training, which lasted about two months, and some went to Hong Kong for training. When Luoyang fell, more than 300 middle school students captured by the Communist Party were trained by the Communist Party in Zhu Jiaguan in Lingbao, and all of them will be sent back to the Guanzhong area behind the government, using their student identity to cover up their activities. For young students who secretly sneaked into the Communist area in Northwest China, the Communist Party specially established the pseudo-Yan'an University Luochuan Branch to accommodate and train them, and used "study and test at any time" as a slogan. The Communist Party in the Exi Xiangnan area established the pseudo "Patriotic Democratic Cadre School" to recruit and train young students. The Communist Party in the Yue Min border area is also actively recruiting middle school students to give them training. The training class of the ninth sub-regional workers' department of the pseudo-Central China Military Region is located on the coast of Juegang, a county of pseudo-Ru (Bi) Dong (Tai), and trains spies of the Communist Party in the Jiangnan area.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding fleeing to the Communist area to escape punishment, Hua Binqing, a graduate of Central University in Nanjing (has been arrested), attempted to flee to the Communist area in Chao County, Yuan Shuidou of Fudan University fled back to the Communist area in Shandong two months ago, Gan Weiyuan of Jiaotong University has also sneaked into the Communist area, and Yan Tingchang, the secretary of the Guanghua "Student Federation" branch, has voluntarily dropped out of school and fled back to Subei. Several students from Peking University, including Deng Te, who were previously arrested in Beiping in a Communist spy case, were released on bail by the Special Criminal Court. After being repeatedly rejected, they have fled to the Communist area.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding being incited by the Communist Party to sneak in to participate in the work of the Communist area: according to Communist Party students in Shanghai, the Communist Party's Central China Military Region (Subei) recently planned to recruit 2,000 college students from Beijing and Shanghai to work in the Communist area. On July 2, Jiaotong University discovered that a Communist Party student who had been expelled had posted a notice inciting students to go to the Communist area, which is one example. Among the 56 students expelled from Huaxia University on July 5, two-thirds of them left Shanghai in batches in late July, either to Subei and Shandong, or to Hong Kong to enter the Communist area in Guangdong to participate in the rebellion. Yucai Middle School is one of the Communist Party's student movement bases in Shanghai. This year, some graduates of the school have been introduced to the Communist area. In the Pingjin area, Communist Party students launched the so-called "Jidong Action Movement" in various schools, inciting the arrested, "students who are afraid of exams, go to the Communist area in Candong", and have been found to have formed a group, including Sun Jinghuang, the principal of the Beiping National First Midwifery School, and her husband, Zhang Wenjie, Qu Zhiming, Wang Zhenfang, Zhao Huiyuan, Tangshan Feng, teachers of the Central Primary School in Kaiping County, Yu Hongye, students of the Beiping Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School, Cui Hua, Li Pan and others. In addition, during the period when Kaifeng was once lost, 79 Communist Party members and members of the Democratic League of Henan University fled to the Communist area in Western Henan, including Ji Wenfu, Wang Yiqi, and Li Houfu. In Hong Kong, the Dade College of the Democratic League officially announced to students on June 5 that it would assist students who have completed their studies or have financial difficulties and are about to withdraw from school or who volunteer to work in the "Liberated Area" The regulations stipulate that those who wish to go to the "Liberated Area" of Ao Gui Min, South China and Nanyang can be introduced by the school board and Xinhua News Agency respectively.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding being induced to participate in the so-called "rural work" to engage in armed riots in the rear: the Yunnan anti-bandit troops found that there were leading figures in the former Kunming student unrest among the Communist Party members in Da Yao Bin Le, Lvxi, Shiping, Yinbei and other lines, such as Ma Li (female), Shu Shou Xun, Jiang Yongzun and others. The Communist Party's Huashang Daily also admitted recently that a large number of Communist Party students and teachers participated in the Communist Party troops in Yunnan. In Hong Kong, the Communist Party has been chanting the so-called: "Intellectuals go to the countryside" and has been engaged in riots for a long time. Recently, it has been constantly found that primary school students are also abducted to the Communist area to participate in the training of the "Little Children's Team" (also known as the "Little Heroes" Team), which has been confirmed by the Hong Kong government and the students' parents, and many cases have been cracked.</p>
<p>It can be seen from the above that the Communist Party today is stepping up the use of schools to induce students, on the one hand, to launch urban riots and rural riots in our country, and on the other hand, to increase the manpower of the Communist area and cultivate rebel cadres. The Communist Party's so-called principles of "combining urban democratic movement with rural armed struggle", "Communist area work and government area rear are progressing simultaneously", and "cultivating rural work cadres from urban struggle" have now been applied one by one. Here it is further proved that the seriousness of the current student unrest has reached the point of endangering the security of the entire country and society, and it must be thoroughly eliminated.

<p>Shaoxing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The return of civilian land for the Cao'e Airport in this county has aroused many doubts from all walks of life. Disputes have occurred repeatedly, and even armed fights between landlords and tenants have occurred. This was learned by Lu, the station chief of the Ningbo Air Force Station, who came to Shaoxing on the 16th to inquire about the airport land with the county government. It is now known that the original area of the land was more than 800 acres. When registering in 1947, more than 70 acres overflowed. During the re-registration this year, some lawless elements, seeing that there were profits, competed to register first, many of which were impersonations, false evidence, and false claims. As a result, the amount exceeded the original acreage by more than 600 acres, resulting in an opportunity for embezzlement. Station Chief Lu found that the accounting staff had embezzled as much as 30 billion yuan. Currently, local people believe that the return procedures are quite unfair and demand that the county government re-register.</p>

<h3>Please Improve the Nanmatou Ferry by the Health Bureau</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Wharf (i.e., Lujiabang Ferry Station) on the other side of the Huangpu River is an important ferry for people traveling to and from Pudong. The Tongren Fuyuantang Lifesaving Bureau is located in the middle. Coffins are displayed horizontally, flies and maggots gather, the autumn sun is rampant, and the stench is soaring. Travelers coming and going are pushing their noses and complaining bitterly. At the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, the epidemic is prevalent, and it is very easy to spread. If we do not find a way to improve the ferry, and once the epidemic area is reported, the consequences will be endless. Shanghai is an international city with a dense population. Preventing problems before they occur is urgent. I sincerely hope that the health authorities will find a way to improve it for the benefit of pedestrians. It is a public convenience.</p>

<h3>The Transportation Management Committee Reviews Non-Quota Goods, Approving 30,000 US Dollars Daily, The Person in Charge of the Non-Quota Department Announces the Review Situation</h3>
<p>The Transportation Management Committee stipulates that import goods on the "Appendix" (3A) categories must apply for import permission, but the quantity depends on the actual needs and foreign exchange positions, which is quite flexible. Moreover, the review procedures of the committee take a lot of time, so all walks of life are quite dissatisfied with it. According to the person in charge of the non-quota review department of the committee, the foreign exchange amount woven into the "Appendix" (1) (3A) categories of goods was previously stipulated to be 50,000 US dollars per day and 1.5 million US dollars per month, but in reality, due to backlog relations, the average daily approval is only more than 30,000 US dollars. From the beginning of July to date, a total of 1.25 million US dollars has been approved in one and a half months.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge, this is not caused by the slow procedures of the department, but there are considerable difficulties. It is rumored that the committee has approved the import of 10 million US dollars of production equipment and other materials, which is actually a part of the US aid, which is slightly different from the work managed by the committee. It is also said that the committee has received more than 100 applications for self-provided foreign exchange in the past. Since the promulgation of the measures for the import of overseas Chinese capital and foreign funds, there have been hundreds of applicants, but at present, the implementing rules have not been approved by the Executive Yuan, so it is not convenient to handle them for the time being.</p>
<h3>Wavering Sentiment in the Market: Chinese Stocks End Uncertainly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were marked by wavering sentiment and tight credit conditions, leading to an exceptionally anxious trading day. The morning session opened weakly, and the situation worsened consistently. A brief rally occurred mid-day but quickly stalled. The closing was very uncertain. With the exception of cement and real estate stocks which reached their daily limit, the rest saw mixed results.</p>
<p>Initially, negative economic news created uncertainty. The market was also disappointed that previous rumors regarding the State Bank’s deposit surplus proved false. Everbright Cotton Yarn opened at 168,000 yuan and fell sharply to 162,300 yuan before being driven back up to 164,500 yuan. Eventually, unusual business activity and a tight money supply caused general stocks to slump. Sell-offs occurred. Besides Shanghai Cement and Everbright Cotton Yarn rising to their daily limits, everything trended lower. Around noon, off-market interest rates rose to 29 and 32 yuan, causing a drop to a low of 161,200 yuan. Shanghai Industrial maintained its position. By the noon close, aside from Everbright Cotton Yarn and Shanghai Cement, which reached their limit, Xinyi, Qinxing, Tongyi, Yonggong, and Commercial Press experienced slight declines, with match stocks remaining flat. All other stocks fell by between 5% and 10%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, due to an eased money supply, Everbright Cotton Yarn opened higher at 168,500 yuan. However, renewed external pressures caused a surge, driving the price to a high of 173,300 yuan. This rally was short lived. With the exception of the two cement stocks and one real estate stock, which remained at their daily limit, the remaining stocks retreated from their highs. Conflicting rumors regarding State Bank’s clearing activities further fueled market uncertainty. After struggling, Everbright Cotton Yarn closed at 169,800 yuan. Following the close, due to the State Bank's large clearing surplus, asking prices rose slightly. Compared to the morning close, except for China Cement and Everbright Cotton Yarn which were at their limit, Xinhe, Dongxing, Tongyi, Datong, Underwear, Commercial Press, and Zhabei rose by 5%, with the rest experiencing small gains. Off-market, unlisted stocks such as Dasheng Culture, Bank, Tobacco, and Public Utilities rose by about 5%, while the rest were also stable.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday, high prices were stifled by tight credit conditions, preventing sustainability. Types A and B reached 2 million, Type C reached 2.7 million, Type D reached 2.16 million, and Type E reached 2.28 million, all new peaks. A slight correction occurred near the close, but the bonds still rose significantly. Room 552 was sold, while rooms 500, 550, and 503 purchased. Room 360 bought some Type C and sold others, gaining 10% to 15% more than the previous close, with over 5 million in transactions.</p>
<h3>Money Supply Initially Tight, Then Loosens; Banks Still Have Large Clearing Surpluses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money supply in the city first tightened, then loosened. Four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had significant clearing surpluses in the interbank clearing of checks and drafts, totaling 347.35 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a surplus of 97.82 billion, the Bank of China had a surplus of 228.58 billion, the Bank of Communications had a surplus of 48.65 billion, the Farmers Bank had a surplus of 11.32 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 28.37 billion, Postal Remittances had a surplus of 6 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a deficit of 10.71 billion. Commercial banks had a large clearing surplus of 85.8 billion, a small clearing deficit of 144.98 billion, and foreign banks had a total deficit of 210.95 billion.</p>
<p>Severe Shortage of Funds</p>
<p>Although 250,000 New Customs Gold Units have been issued, the supply of cash is still very scarce. Banks continue to impose strict limits on cash withdrawals, leading to numerous disputes between customers and banks. It is reported that after the new banknotes were issued, they were taken to other cities to profit from exchange rate differences.</p>
<h3>Goods Owners Insisting on Higher Prices Leads to Sluggish Sales; Little Change in Rice Prices; Premium Rice Market Softens Near Close</h3>
<p>The rice market opened with a slight increase, then declined due to high prices in the production areas. Goods owners strongly insisted on higher prices, driving prices up by 200 to 300 yuan in the early market. However, due to sluggish sales, rice shops took a wait-and-see attitude, leading to a decline. Prices for regular rice in both the North and South markets rose by 100 to 200 yuan. Premium rice remained at its original price of 68 million, but softened even further near the close, with prices similar to the previous day. Brown rice opened at 55 million, then retreated to 54 million. Yesterday's total arrivals in both markets were 5,522 dan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Fluctuated sharply. Due to weak sales to merchants, trading was light. Prices were initially pushed higher in the early market, but ultimately softened, although the changes were minimal. Old Army Flour reached a high of 23.8 million, then closed at 23.4 million. Battleship Flour fell from 23 million to 22.7 million, a net increase of 200,000 to 400,000. Red Bee rose slightly by 100,000. Jiancheng remained steady. Bran added 100,000 to 200,000. Wheat mill price opened at 37 million.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Increased slowly. Due to weak commodity prices, sentiment was low. Merchant demand was moderate. Soybeans increased slightly by 1 million. Hankou beans were 37 million. New corn was popular among merchants, rising by 300,000 to 400,000. Barley rose by 2 million. Broad beans were traded in small quantities with a slight price increase of 50,000. Sorghum did not open. Tea beans had little trading and stable prices. Sesame rose by 300,000 to 400,000, with yellow sesame being more popular. Peanuts declined by 200,000.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Various trends in the vegetable oil market. Soybean oil initially opened lower due to flat external commodity prices, starting at 158 million, but rose after a period of consolidation as sales picked up. Factory prices were not low, so soybean oil closed higher at 162 million, the same as the previous day. Rapeseed oil ended at 142 million, also steady. Sesame oil rose by 5 million due to lower prices and limited inventory. Small cart sesame oil saw merchant speculation, rising by 10 million. Soybean cake also trended higher, increasing by 200,000 to 300,000. Lizi cake was 14.1 million.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, export merchants continued to seek tea on the foreign exchange tea market, especially for Zhenmei and other green teas. Jardine Matheson and Xinhua Wuchang tea companies showed a willingness to buy at any price. However, market supply has not increased, leading to limited supply and higher prices. Trading remained flat near the close. Prices rose across the board. Domestic sales followed suit.</p>
<h3>Banks Adjust Domestic Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The domestic exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury were adjusted on the 19th as follows: Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou, all 200 yuan; Shantou, 250 yuan; Chongqing, 250 yuan; Wuhan, 180 yuan; Qingdao, 30 yuan; Zhangjiakou and Jiujiang, all 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lumber Market Declines</h3>
<p>In the lumber market, fir continued to decline. Sales of foreign pine were sluggish, making it difficult for the market to recover.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 18th] Rice inventory is low, sales are brisk, and demand is strong, continuing to drive prices higher. Other commodities are wavering due to rumors of peace talks. White rice is sold at 60 million at the door, 58.76 million in the market, white yuan 58.36 million, yangxian 57.96 million, budao 57.86 million, wheat 5 million, white wheat 9 million, flour 23.15 million, cotton yarn 1.58 billion, and cotton yarn 2.31 billion.</p>

Those who underreport or provide false information will be fined or suspended.</p>
<h3>New Purchases Stalled, Scattered Sales, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market Trend Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market trended downward due to the excessive gains of the previous day, reduced customer demand, tighter credit conditions among traders, and weaker external commodity prices. Textile companies also lowered their bids, leading to scattered sales.</p>
<p>42-count blue fine yarn opened strong. Because the rise in recent days was less than coarse yarn, manufacturers were not selling much, leading to another increase. However, a strong wave of weakness caused a decline of 700,000 to 800,000. Near the close, many rumors of profit-taking emerged, ultimately resulting in the sale of 3.2 billion, with 3.25 billion due tomorrow, down 50 million to 100 million from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined slightly by 30 million to 50 million each. A total of 49 bales were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market trended downward due to concerns about new economic plans and currency reforms, leading to weakened sentiment. New buyers were hesitant to make purchases. Market traders and merchants were eager to sell at high prices due to high interest rates. Many small traders were also selling at a loss.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened firm due to dyeing factory demand, driving the market price up by 800,000. However, increased selling pressure lowered the price by 4 to 5 million. Around 10:30, traders with available funds started buying, pushing the price up to 91.5 million, but ultimately settling at 90 million, a net increase of 1.8 million from the previous day (down 1.5 million from the off-market asking price).</p>
<p>Other fine cloths such as Five Blessings, Trumpet, Tongyanghe, and twill cloth, bleached cloth, and serge rose by 1.5 million to 5 million each. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth were stable due to factory adjustments. Yitong Navtuo rose by 10 million.</p>
<p>After the close, rumors circulated that the Hong Kong exchange rate was being eased, leading to bullish sentiment. Dragon Head fine cloth was being offered at 89 million, with 90.5 million due tomorrow. A total of 2,160 pieces of cloth were traded.</p>
<p>Also, due to rising prices of various commodities in the afternoon, 21-count Shuangma yarn was trading actively off-market, up 3 to 4 million. Dragon Head fine cloth was 3 million higher than the afternoon close.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Fulai Company's Siamese Eamlihao sailed from Shanghai to India yesterday, carrying over 3,100 pieces of yarn and cloth to Zhijia Port.</p>

They have jointly issued an open letter appealing for a stable learning environment and demanding the removal of instigators of student movements lurking among the students. The letter is signed by Wang Qiutao and 130 others, and states: "We have poured so much effort and borne such heavy economic burdens, hoping that they can have a peaceful learning environment and become useful talents. The reality has shattered our hopes. According to the Ministry of Education, there have been 96 student movements in the past year, wasting 506 days of study time, which is unprecedented. Now that school is starting, it is not too late to remedy the situation.

<h3>World Games Basketball: China vs. Belgium, A Two-Point Victory in Overtime</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from London] On August 2nd, at 9 PM, our country's basketball team was still at the Harlem Gymnasium in West London, engaging in their first round-robin match against the Belgian basketball team. Due to the rain, the audience was not particularly large. Our team members displayed exceptional skills, and ultimately, in a five-minute overtime period after a tie game, they narrowly defeated Belgium by a score of 36 to 34, with a one-basket difference. This was the first victory for our country's delegation to the World Games, and it was truly exhilarating. The lineup and game summary are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang, Huang Tianxi</p>
<p>Cai Wenhua (Jia Zhijun)</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao, Bao Songyuan.</p>
<p>Leading from the Start</p>
<p>Today, our country's basketball team was greatly boosted by the return of star player Li Shiqiao, who had recovered from illness and arrived in England by plane from Singapore. He made his first appearance and contributed to the team's momentum. After the tip-off, our team immediately took a 5-2 lead. Center Cai Wenhua scored with a long-range shot, making it 7-2. Belgium attempted to catch up, scoring a basket, but unfortunately, left defender Huang Tianxi fouled while Belgium was shooting, resulting in two free throws, making the score 7-6. After this, our team launched an offensive, with right forward Li Shiqiao, using his quick and skillful, beautifully stable movements, passing and attacking with right forward Wu Chengzhang, scoring two consecutive baskets, causing Belgium to call a timeout and make substitutions, resulting in frequent fouls. Our team ultimately led 16-13 at halftime.</p>
<p>Tie Game</p>
<p>After switching sides in the second half, our team continued with the original lineup. After some back and forth, Wu Chengzhang jumped up in an opening and threw the ball in with one hand. Center Cai Wenhua also scored with a long-range shot, giving the Chinese team a commanding lead of 20-13. Belgium launched a desperate counterattack, but their shooting was poor, missing many times, wasting opportunities. Despite their efforts to play with brute force, it was to no avail. In the last ten minutes, right defender Huang Tianxi injured his hand and was replaced by Jia Zhijun. At this time, our team still had a six-point lead at 32-26. Unexpectedly, in the last four minutes, Belgium suddenly launched a counterattack, scoring three consecutive baskets. The game ended with a tie score of 32-32.</p>
<p>Overtime Decides the Winner</p>
<p>In the five-minute overtime period, after switching sides, the situation was extremely tense. Both teams' cheering squads encouraged their players, shouting "Add oil!" After two minutes, the Belgian left and right defenders panicked and committed consecutive fouls, resulting in our team scoring four points from free throws, taking a lead of 36-32. In the last minute, Belgium scored a basket, but ultimately, our team defeated the Belgian team 36-34. This time, our country's basketball team displayed wonderful and clear passing. Li Shiqiao was agile and exceptionally nimble. Wu Chengzhang displayed both intelligence and courage. Center Cai Wenhua's long-range shooting was accurate, which was greatly appreciated by the foreign audience. The two defenders also covered both sides, showing great improvement compared to the match against Chile.</p>

<h3>Our World Games Delegation Departs England in Batches to Return Home</h3>
<p>Tian Hanxiang Discusses Reasons for Failure</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Kunming, August 18th] Tian Hanxiang, secretary of our World Games delegation, said during his transit through Kunming: "Our delegation is departing England in batches after the closing ceremony. General leader Wang Zhengting, general secretary Xuan Shouyi, and others are taking a detour through the United States for observation. He, along with Lou Wenao, Chen Yinglang, and Wang Zhenglin, are in one batch. The entire basketball team will depart two days after them and are currently participating in friendly matches in Canada. Continuing, he said that although our athletes did not qualify for the finals in this competition, they have improved in terms of individual technique and sportsmanship compared to the previous games. The reasons for the failure are due to inferior physical strength and the lack of long-term, organized training. The basketball team also has problems with passing techniques. Because players from friendly countries, especially American players, mostly use fast passes, while our team still uses slow passes, the outcome of the games is determined by this. Cyclist He Haohua fractured his neck and suffered abrasions all over his left side during the competition. He cried because he was unable to win glory for his country. He is currently recuperating in England and is expected to be discharged from the hospital in about two weeks."</p>

<h3>Watered-Down Articles</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Nine out of ten words spoken by a person daily are nonsense. Articles are refined words, and writers, when putting pen to paper, should be concise. The Chinese idiom "言簡意賅" (yan jian yi gai, concise and comprehensive) should be a fundamental requirement for articles. In other words, writers should strive to "speak at length when there is something to say, and briefly when there is nothing to say." Today, not only is there much nonsense in speech, but there is also no less nonsense in writing. In my opinion, rather than listening to incessant nonsense, it would be better if everyone suffered from stuttering and could not speak. The ancient Han Fei "stuttered and could not speak well, but was good at writing." Perhaps his "good at writing" was precisely because he "stuttered" and was not good at speaking nonsense.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the writing of the ancients was far more concise than that of today. The reason for this is that printing in ancient times was difficult, and carving books was not easy, so writing had to be concise, which is one reason. Secondly, the ancients regarded "establishing words" as being on par with "establishing merit" and "establishing virtue," hence the saying "morality and writing." The sages of old only "retired to write books and establish doctrines" when "the Way was not practiced," viewing it as a very important matter. Their intentions were not entirely the same as those of today's people who desperately attack the authorities before taking office in order to advance their careers, but they are similar to Churchill writing his memoirs after retiring to recount past events in order to illuminate the rise and fall of dynasties. Thirdly, when the ancients wrote books, they never considered manuscript fees of how many yuan per thousand words. If calculated by the number of words, Mencius's seven chapters, with a total of 34,685 words, could be sold for approximately 200 million legal currency at today's general market price, enough to exchange for three loads of rice. Laozi's Daodejing, with 5,000 words, is even less valuable, probably only enough to exchange for two loads of coal balls. Nowadays, writers often dash off 5,000 words a day, and accumulating a month's worth of work is enough to match thirty Laozi's, but the more modern Laozi's there are, the less admirable their writing becomes.</p>
<p>This is not to say that articles should not be written, but rather that one should not rely on selling them for a living. Lu Xun's instruction to his son not to become a "hollow literary man" probably meant the same thing. But consider, if Mencius were born in this era and made writing his profession, and his family were not wealthy, then even if he did not divorce his wife, his wife would inevitably leave him because of the difficulty of making a living without rice. Would it not be a misjudgment to mislead people into such a state by making writing a profession?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is true that the ancients wrote concisely and with a serious attitude because printing was difficult. However, this does not mean that today's advanced printing technology justifies careless writing and arbitrary content. On the contrary, precisely because today's printing technology is advanced, writers should be more serious and cautious when putting pen to paper. Think about it: with today's printing technology, articles written on the same day can be presented to millions of readers on the same day and spread throughout the country. The magnitude of its influence is not difficult to imagine, and the importance of the writer's responsibility is self-evident. But this is not the case. Today, there are many articles that, upon examination of their intentions, are simply speaking for one's own private interests, or they are elaborately structured, stretching three or two sentences into a lengthy article. Articles have expanded along with inflation and become "diluted."</p>
<p>Reading Han Mingxian's "For Whom the Bell Tolls," this book is over 300,000 words long, but after reading it, I feel that it could be summarized in just three sentences: During the Spanish Civil War, a patriot planned to blow up a bridge, and then had several physical relationships with a woman. The end of the book states that the patriot finally blew up the bridge. The author could have written these three sentences on the back of a postage stamp without feeling cramped, but he did not mind writing a large book of 467 pages. Among all the books I have read, this one stands out as the most boring, worst, absurd, and meaningless.</p>
<p>But looking back at our country, there have been similar books. People often think that our country's publishing industry is poor. In my opinion, rather than spending money to buy and read books written in extremely bad style and with extremely shallow meaning, it would be better to let it be poor and save some paper and ink.</p>
<h3>The Words of a Newsstand Vendor</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>There is a newsstand near my residence (west of the entrance to the Jindu Cinema). I often go there to buy newspapers or magazines, and when business is slow, I often chat with the newsstand vendor. When the price of each copy of the Ta Kung Pao and Shen Pao increased from 40,000 to 80,000, the prices of various publications also increased simultaneously. He told me: "Before the price increase, I could sell about 7 million yuan a day, making a profit of 2%, which is a net profit of 150,000 yuan per day. After the price increase, I can sell about 10 million yuan a day, but it doesn't double to 1.5 million yuan." Now that the Ta Kung Pao and Shen Pao sell for 160,000 yuan each, one day I asked him about the sales situation. He said: "It's the same as before. The prices of newspapers, magazines, and books have doubled again, but sales have only reached 50% to 60%. On Sundays, I can sell up to 20 million yuan, but on weekdays I can only sell 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan. Now I make a net profit of about 3 million yuan per day, but because prices often jump more than double or triple in half a month or a month, the standard of living is not as comfortable as it was with the previous income of 150,000 yuan." He also told me: "There are four people in my family, and although I have 80 to 90 million yuan a month, life is still very difficult." I asked about the sales of major newspapers, tabloids, and magazines. He said: "After the price increase, the sales of major newspapers are still normal. Xinwen Bao, Shen Pao, and Ta Kung Pao sell the most. In the past, tabloids such as Fei Bao, Luo Shihhan, and Tie Bao sold well, but after the price increase, there are fewer buyers. As for magazines, Guancha sells the easiest, followed by Zhanwang, Xinwen Tiandi, etc." Analyzing the above words, one can draw the conclusion that the number of readers has decreased by about one-third in the recent two months of inflation.</p>
<p>In the publishing industry column of the Ta Kung Pao on July 22nd, there was an article entitled "Nightmare of the Publishing Industry," which said: "He dreamed that Mr. Price was flying an airplane with many passengers on board, all of whom were fat, strong, and rosy-cheeked. He remembered the names of these passengers: Miss Gold, Mrs. Silver, Mr. Rice, Young Master Flour... etc. He then looked at himself and his friends, such as manuscript fees, newspapers, books, writers, readers, etc., all of whom were gaunt and haggard, with a deep pallor on their faces. He couldn't help but smile bitterly."</p>
<p>This article, written by Han Songjun, is extremely profound and makes one feel very awkward, unable to laugh. The cultural industry has indeed reached a dead end. Not only publishers, writers, and readers have a deep pallor on their faces, but even those in the newsstand have been greatly affected. I am writing this article to supplement what Han Song has written insufficiently.</p>

<h3>Three Recent Poems</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>河南河北又兵戈，雁失歸羣燕失窠，夕照洛陽宮一角，天涯涕淚在銅駝！(Henan and Hebei are at war again, Geese lost their flocks, swallows lost their nests, A corner of Luoyang Palace in the sunset, Tears flow to the horizon on the bronze camel!)</p>
<p>落帆亭 (Luofan Pavilion)</p>
<p>落帆亭外落帆船，船去船來共一川（亭在嘉興城外，舟楫過此下帆），妾似來船郞似去，去來船總讓人先。(Sailing boats drop their sails outside Luofan Pavilion, Boats come and go together on one river (The pavilion is outside Jiaxing City, where boats lower their sails), I am like a boat coming, you are like a boat leaving, The departing and arriving boats always give way to each other.)</p>
<p>汪亞塵自美寄贈魚樂圖 (Fish Playing, a Painting Gift from Wang Yachen from the United States)</p>
<p>殷勤寓里故人書，展拜新鱗錦不如，栩栩幾忘身是蝶，愉愉寗識我非魚；曾經桑海參三昩，久歷風波付一噓，兵革黄塵今似昔，天涯猶有白雲居。(A letter from an old friend from afar, Unfolding the new scales, not as beautiful as brocade, Vividly, I almost forget that I am a butterfly, Happily, I recognize that I am not a fish; Having experienced the mulberry sea and understood the Samadhi, Having endured the storms, I let out a sigh, The wars and yellow dust are like the past, There is still a white cloud residence on the horizon.)</p>
<h3>Ullambana Festival</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Among the twelve months of the lunar calendar, July is considered the "Ghost Month," so when this month arrives, folk customs include the so-called Ullambana Festival, especially on the fifteenth day, which is the most lively. I remember when I was young, I liked to watch the big-headed ghosts, small-headed ghosts, and impermanent ghosts in the parade, especially the Ghost King, and I was most afraid of the Ghost King. Thinking about it now, it's quite funny. Nowadays, these things are no longer seen. What can be seen are only monks setting up altars in the streets and alleys, releasing flaming mouths, which can be considered a decoration for this ghost festival.</p>
<p>The word "Ullambana" is originally a transliteration from Sanskrit, meaning "upside down," referring to the merit of doing this to relieve the suffering of beings in hell who are hung upside down, not to drive away plagues and epidemics. Therefore, in Yan Zhitui's Family Instructions, the final chapter states: "If you want to repay the boundless virtue and sorrow of frost and dew, sometimes make offerings and the Ullambana Festival in the middle of July, I hope you will do so." The final chapter is Zhitui's will, which earnestly mentions "Ullambana," which can serve as proof that it is not for driving away plagues and epidemics, and it shows that this custom already existed during the Six Dynasties. Nowadays, in the customs of Jiangsu, when a person dies and the first Ullambana Festival arrives, it is called the "New Ullambana Festival." Descendants must hire monks to recite scriptures to transcend the deceased, in order to fulfill filial piety, which is still the intention of the Six Dynasties, but they don't always practice Ullambana.</p>
<h3>Gong Xiaogong and Zhao Huifu</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>Gong Xiaogong is a legendary traitor, but there is no evidence. In Beidu, I once saw someone trying to sell a large album of his handwritten letters, all addressed to Zhao Huifu. The handwriting was very strange, and one could tell at a glance that the person was not upright. However, when discussing his own academic thoughts, he still spoke like a Confucian scholar. When discussing the court at the time, he still adhered to the rules of a subject, not as arrogant as the legends say. This is the best research material on Xi Shi's life, but unfortunately, I don't know who owns it now. Later, after seeing the Chronological Biography of Zhao Huifu compiled by Jinren Chen Naigan, I learned that Zhao's Neng Ju Diary had also been leaked out, which included a letter to Wei Banzhong describing his fallout with Gong over the sale of steles. The matter was extremely convoluted and trivial. It was because he was poor and sold things, and because of selling things, he was particular about the value. This is something that collectors and celebrities often cannot avoid. The reason he wrote to Wei was that they were both close friends who could mediate. Mo Shen and Ding'an both belonged to the Daoguang Dynasty celebrities. Because they sought knowledge of anecdotes and paid attention to current affairs, they were both dissatisfied with the status quo. Also, because they were inclined to New Text Confucianism, they liked very much unconventional and strange arguments. Their thoughts and behaviors were not accustomed to by the people at the time, so they became more and more eccentric. I heard that Wei Mo Weng personally chopped the plates of his own Sacred Martial Records in his later years, and it is also rumored that he suffered from phlegm disease in his later years. It is quite suspicious whether he had some revolutionary consciousness. It is unavoidable that Xiaogong's being viewed by people as a traitor is also a manifestation of revolutionary thought. Even Zhao Huifu, who was known as a disciple of Xiangxiang, had a passage in his diary of the sixth year of Tongzhi expressing his dissatisfaction with the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>... Yu said: The world has been at peace and unified for a long time, and it will inevitably gradually lead to division. However, the ruler's virtue is inherently important, and the atmosphere has not yet opened up. If it is not a rotten heart, then the situation of the collapse of the earth and tiles will not be formed. Judging by the intensity, the disaster in the future must first fundamentally overturn, and then the various regions will have no master, and people will govern themselves, which will probably not take fifty years. Shi frowned for a long time and said: Then should we move south? Yu said: I am afraid that it will sink to the bottom and will not necessarily be like Jin and Song. Shi said: The current dynasty has righteous ruler's virtue, or it will not come to this. Yu said: The ruler's virtue is righteous, and the country's prosperity has been heavily rewarded. The founding of the country was too easy, and the slaughter was too heavy, so those who had the world were too skillful. Heaven's way is difficult to know, good and evil do not cover each other, and the virtue of the later rulers is not enough to rely on.</p>
<p>From the sixth year of Tongzhi to the third year of Xuantong, it was exactly forty-five years, and his prophecy came true.</p>
<h3>Talking About Meditation Experience (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>Actual Experience in the Past Twenty-Seven Months</p>
<p>When I first started meditating, I placed a watch next to me and counted my breaths silently, considering each breath as one count. Initially, I couldn't prolong my breaths, so going through a hundred counts took a very short time. Later, I continuously put in effort to gradually prolong my breaths. After half a year, each hundred counts took ten minutes. Now, it takes fifteen minutes. Master Zhu once said: "It is already very good to have fifteen minutes for every hundred counts." I believe I can prolong it further in the future.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing to achieve while meditating is not allowing any thoughts to arise. Sometimes, the more you try to eliminate thoughts, the more thoughts come forth endlessly, which is the most frustrating. There is no other way to deal with this difficulty except to train slowly and gradually subdue them. Even now, I can only truly maintain a state of no thoughts for fifteen minutes. Beyond that, I dare not say. I believe that by continuously training in this way, I can continue to prolong the time of thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>A clear mind with no thoughts allows the sensory and motor nerves to rest completely, which is obviously extremely beneficial for physical health. At the same time, a method of deep and delicate breathing is practiced along with it, which is the so-called abdominal exercise, allowing the sympathetic nervous system to be trained. Precisely because of this, two situations that cause impatience arise when first learning to meditate: (1) The chest feels stuffy and uncomfortable because, during normal breathing, muscle movement is only on the diaphragm. When practicing deep and delicate breathing, the diaphragm must move up and down. This is most uncomfortable when practice is not yet proficient, especially during the first month or two. When experiencing this feeling, I used great patience to restrain it. After three or four months, I felt my chest become empty, relaxed, and comfortable. (2) There is also the layer of no thoughts, which can sometimes also make one feel bored. The more you try not to think, the more thoughts surge like a tide. When one thought is dispelled, another thought arises. If one cannot endure this, one may suddenly get up and no longer want to sit. Because I had already made up my mind beforehand, I was able to cope with this somewhat. After about four or five months, I no longer felt so bored.</p>
<p>After four or five months, the first thing I felt comfortable with was the abdomen becoming warm, and then hot. By seven or eight months, the heat was even more intense. After a year, the heat also expanded in range, sometimes reaching the chest, extending to the upper limbs, then to the arms, and then to the back. At this time, the whole body truly felt an indescribable pleasure. I remember that in May of the thirty-sixth year—that is, after meditating for a year—there was one time when my abdomen felt hot, and I suddenly felt my chest tingle and relax. The skin and muscles all experienced a wonderful pleasure. This lasted for about ten minutes. In June of this year—that is, after meditating for two years—there was another time when my abdomen felt hot, and my chest immediately felt loose, which soon expanded to my left and right arms and hands. However, the abdomen feeling hot did not happen every time I meditated. It happened about six or seven times out of ten. Also, the abdomen usually felt hot only after meditating for thirty minutes, but there were also times when I felt hot after sitting for only ten minutes, but this happened less often. I believe that if I continue to meditate in this way, the wonderful states of chest relaxation, etc., mentioned above will continue to "flow forth."</p>
<p>In the first five or six months of meditation, the nerves in my head felt like they were wriggling, but it wasn't tingling. Sometimes, on both sides of my head, it felt like there was a line under the skin wriggling, moving up and down, passing along the sides of my face, reaching the neck, and seemingly going down to the chest. The sensation wasn't too difficult to describe. Once, I felt the wriggling under the skin on the top of my head quite intensely, and then it was directly on top, as if the middle of the right side had split open into a seam, but in an instant, it stopped as usual. This state of nerve wriggling gradually decreased after two years. In recent months, I have rarely had this feeling. Sometimes it only appears briefly and then disappears.</p>
<p>Also, after four or five months, my legs suddenly trembled slightly, three or four times. I haven't had this phenomenon for a long time now.</p>
