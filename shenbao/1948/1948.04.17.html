<h3>國大七組分別集會　提案百件審查完竣　修憲爭論激烈未獲結論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕國大十六日無大會，總統侯選八公告，於上午九時在國民大會堂門前張貼，民衆及代表等圍觀者甚衆。十六日七組審查委會分別集會，審查提案，各組進行均極順利，一般提案一百件已全部審查完竣，惟第一審委會審查有關憲法案時，爭論激烈，未擭結論，大會定十七日長舉行第十一次會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕修改憲法之提案六件，經十五日一讀會通過交付審查後，大會第一審查委會，即憲法審查組，十六日晨九時二十分開會，除將該六案提會討論外，並將有關憲法之提案共十三件一併提出，審查會出席二九七人，張知本主席，首說明本組審查各案計分四部，（一）主張修改憲法者，（二）主張不修改條女，而提補充辦法者，（三）主張不修改憲法者，（四）確定國民大會之會期者。是否即進行分類廣泛討論，旋以有人認為張知本為提案人之一，不應為本組召集人，更不應為主席，曾一度引起會塲之紛擾。會議進行中，前後共有代表廿一人發言，分主張修改與反對修改兩鍾意見，兩派發言者各獲得相當熱烈之擁護當聲。計反對修改憲法者有肅納鑫，陳端本，方綿，曹屏藩，史新三，江世義等。主張修憲者有劉家樹，馬續常，馬承驥，將建白等，另外王寵惠，潘公展並提出新意見。王寵惠稱：修憲問題，非能不能修改，而是在現局勢之下，吾人可不可修改之問題。制憲時，曾費極大苦心，現逢戡亂之際，時期短暫，是否太怱旦，在主長修憲之提案中，吾人認為定期召開國大修憲辦法甚好，不妨另行定期　會。潘公展則認為，憲法有若干缺點必須修改，但現在時間忽迫，是否交由審查會專負其責，於會後繼其事，其次關於臨時條款授權總統，渠認為乃應事實之需要。十二時散會。</p>
<p>第一組審查憲法　提案人上下午均熱烈發言</p>
<p>下午三時半繼續舉行，出席二九六人，由張映醫主席，首由主席報告有關憲法修改各案於上午經各代表發言後，其中意見分為兩部份，一為主張修改，一為不贊成修改，現續有七十五人要求發言，而憲法提案已分四部份，除修改與否兩部份外，尙有：（一）增列臨時條款，授權總統處理緊急事件，（二）定期召開臨時國大兩部份，盼下午發言即以此兩點為重心，並盼大家遵守時間，俾能獲得結論，提交十七日之二讀會討論。其次並提出十三案中尙有未經提案人說明者，林彬即說明渠听提「定期召集國民大會臨時會案」之要旨。次由史尙寬說明渠之提案「請由本屆國大制定憲法實施程序，以利行憲案」。繼由周利生說明所提「擬請將修改憲法意見彙交行憲立院，或特組委曾整理研究，并擬訂草案提交本曾臨時大會決定案」之要旨，渠係主張修憲，而不贊同目前立即修改者。羅文謨說明渠之提案「請於本次大會閉會後兩年內，依照憲法第卅條第一項第四款之規定，召開國大臨時會，修改憲法案」。潘代表公展之提案，十六日補發，「請大會決定本屆國大召集第二次會議日期，以便代表國民繼續行使政權案」，辦法中係定于卅九年十二月廿五日舉行第一屆第二次會籌開幕禮，如困戡亂早日告成，則可提前召集。潘氏之說明中認為，渠所以指定為卅九年十二月廿五日者，乃以憲法公布業達四年，而戡亂在今後二年餘中，當可完成，如硬性規定為戡亂究成後等字句，則頗不妥。因如戡亂完成復遇外患，吾人又將如何？報告畢，繼續依序發言。戴天球等仍以憲法之前言中曾稱係根據孫中山先生之這敎，而內容則並非如此，吾人實不應以事實限制法律，必須有所補救。周均時則大呼認為修憲提案原則於十五日一讀會已通過，今日即應付表決，不必討論。周之發言復引起會塲之騷動。其後鄭秀卿發言，對授權總統案表示同情。謝澄平稱：修憲與否，不必過分爭執，渠表示接受潘公展之提案，於兩年後召集修憲臨時國大。周利生案，亦可細細研究，大家務須團結一致，不必意氣用事。谷正綱發言稱：渠站在國民黨黨員一份子，亦認為憲法不合孫中山先生之理想，應予修改，但站在現實情况說，如在重視理想之外，尙須顧及理想，實為不可能之事。當前課題為全力戡平匪亂，當提請將潘·羅兩案合併，臨大定於卅九年十二月廿五日舉行，臨時條款乃應事實之需要，大家定能同意，至未討論之各憲法修正案，則交立院制定修正案，提下次臨大討論。谷　　氏發言畢，時已下午六時，即散會。本日未能獲得結論，是否於十七日變更議程，則待十七日大會討論決定。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕國大主席團十六日晚舉行會議，商討十七日議事日程，決定十七日上午舉行大會，原定十七日舉行憲政修改案二讀會，三讀會。因第一組審查有關憲法修改案尙無結果，一一讀會，三讚會延至十八日上下午舉行。十九日選舉總統之日期仍不變。十七日上午大會時，將由第一組審查委會召集人報告十六日審查憲法修改案經過，徵詢大會意見是否需再付審查，由大會表決，如續審查，即於十七日午舉行，十七日上午大會主席推定秦德純担任。又松江代表孔憲榮自縊身死，大會十七日上午將　　致敬，莫德惠並將報告孔自縊經過。</p>

<h3>潘公展主張修憲　惟須謹愼研討精細審查　立院權力太大為現行憲法缺點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕上海區國大代表潘公展氏，十六日就有關憲法修改案問題，答　記者詢問稱：</p>
<p>（一）任何國家憲政是成長的，憲法也是成長的，憲法雖非普通法律，但亦決非一成不變，況我國修改憲法，原是國民大會依法行使之職權，無人在會內或會外可加以限制或剝奪者，但憲法究為根本大法，國大修改憲法，必須愼重將事。回憶前年制憲，似在怱迫之中，相互遷就，勉强成議，遂不免右其缺點，至今為各方所同感遺憾。如果此次國大，又在怱迫之中，為條文字句之斟酌與修正，而即有所決議，萬一不愼，恐又將蹈以前之覆轍。最好能作較長時間之審查研討，而不即作怱遽草率之決定。鄙見由本屆大會授權憲法審查委會，在第一次會議開會以後，對於本次會議未能決議各點，繼續作長期精細之審查，提出詳盡報告，於本屆國民大會第二次會議，為鄭重之修正，以表示憲法之尊嚴。</p>
<p>（二）現行憲法，鄙風以為至少有兩大缺點：（一）國大職繼積極限制，而立法院之權力則無限的擴大，在此種制度下，立法院之權力，絕無任何機關可以為之制衡，大失分權之原意，固然，立法委員亦為民選，但立法院祇有一院，與他國議曾之有上下兩院或參衆兩院者不同。吾人必須使國大對中央法律有創制，複決之權，而後立快院不致為一意孤行之獨斷（他國議會有上下兩院，可以互為牽制，而議會與內閣之間，又有不信任政府與解散議會之牽制，在我國現行憲法中，均無之。此為立法院片面專權之憲法。）（二）總統原為國家元首，統率海陸軍，但中國目前局勢尤其在動員戡亂期間，若依現行憲法，則總統因毫無權力，毫無實任可以達成戡亂之使命。即行政機關亦無此因應局勢之權宜措置，若不圖補救修訂，勢必使行憲後之政府為一毫無權力之政府，亦即為一無能之政府。</p>
<p>（三）因此本人對張知本代表所提修正案及莫德惠代表所提制定臨時條款案，均為贊成與連　之大，無論制定臨時條款也好，或修正憲快也好，總須對此憲法有研補救與改正，此蓋為適應國情與應付大局之必要步驟。</p>
<p>（四）最後，鄙見以為各代表所提憲法修正案，旣上議程，且經過一讀會，自應按照程序，由審查而進二讀三讀。無論贊成或反對，均當有充分發言討論之權，而最後則依法付之表決。凡阻擾他人發言或不服從表決者，均非民主風度，但他國議會對每一重大快案，須經三讀程序者，有時往往並不在同一次會議中完畢其程序，故本次會議付審查之各提案，如以時間迫促，留待下次會議召開時，提出審查報告，再付二或獲三讀，於法並無不合，似値得大會同仁考慮也。</p>
<h3>促政府開發邊疆　第七審查委會工作完成</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕第七審查委會十六日晨十時開會研審有關邊疆提案，出席代表一六七人，白崇禧主席，冷惠然等提「促請政府迅速處理西南夷務，以防邊患案」，以措詞問題首遭邊胞傅正達反對，渠稱夷胞決不願與渶胞為敵，但政府武力在壓抑辦法適足增長仇恨。羅家倫乃謂，旣往不究，本案擱置。新疆吳鐵庫爾，蒙古札奇斯欽均强調邊疆問題即民族問題，札更主張解決生活問題為一切問題根本。林競認為解決夷務問問題，必由中央及川·康·滇三省當局開聯席邊務會談先決定方針，主將本案文句修正，促請政府轉飭賀國光主任從速召集會議。邊胞籠志鈞並提出邊務會議應有邊胞參加，解決問題，以發農邊胞敎育為要務·最後依林競意見將該案案由修正為「促請政府迅速處理西南夷務，增進團結，以固國防案」。並將案文中有傷情感之語句及全部說明刪去，決議擬請通過送請政府切實辦理。繼討論羅哲情錯等提「請以法律規定邊民參政權益案」，其辦法之A項屬於參加議政機構者，因涉及憲法規定移送第一組憲法組。B項屬於參加行政機構者，擬請建議政府盡量培植，並任用邊胞人才之原則，其辦法則依各地情形有殊分別另定。最後審議尹明德等提「擬請政府迅速修築完成西南邊疆之昆洛公路（自昆明向西南經王溪，寗洱，思茅，車里至滇緬交界之打洛）及保密公路（自保山至密支那）之國段公路，以資開發邊疆，建設國防，並發展國際貿易，請公決案」，審查意見通過，建護政府從速撥發經費，令飭主管機關迅速修鞏該兩公路，至午散會，邊疆組提案審查工作全部告成。</p>

<h3>社論　關於修改憲法的兩個提案</h3>
<p>國民大會舉行憲法修正案初讀會後，昨日又將提案交憲法組審查，曾引起主張修憲與反對修憲兩派代表的熱烈辯論。看　勢，憲法是非修改不可的了；但是我們總覺得修改憲法，應該從長計議，特別愼重為是。本報社論對於憲法修改問題，年已有明確的表示。我們認為從法理上解釋：根據憲法第廿七條規定，修改憲法是本屈國民大會的職權之一；再根據憲法第一百七十四條的規定，本屆國民大會只要依照憲法所規定的程序進行，即由國民大會代表總額五分之一之提議，一一一分之二之出席，及出席代表四分之三之決議，修改憲法是絕無問題的。反對修憲派的代表在法理上是絕無理由的。但是在事實上本屆國民大會若欲修改憲法，則必引起新的政洽糾紛。</p>
<p>在昨天憲法組審查提案時，靑年黨民社黨以及一部分無然派的代表，均已堅決表示反對本屆國大修改憲法，他們所持的各種理由，歸納起來，有下列各項：（一）憲法是國家的根本大法，應有固定性，憲法初成尚未實行，即加以修改，似與我國憲法採取剛性主義的原則相違背；（二）任何法政制度均無絕對的優劣，我國憲法尚未付諸實施，當無事實可以證明其有修改的必要；（三）上次國大討論憲草時，也不知費了多少唇舌，始使國大放棄五五憲章，而改採依照政協決議而起草的憲章，故我國憲法實可謂各政黨協議的結果，月前的政治環境與前年相同，當不應加以修正；（四）在本屆國民大會中，仍以國民黨佔絕對的多數，且超過民靑兩黨曁無黨派的總數，國民黨應該特別尊重少數黨的意見。平心而論，民靑兩黨代表反對本屆國大修改憲法，不能不說也有相當充分的理由，但是民靑兩黨的代表却忽略了另一種事實上的需要，使現行憲法，不能不加以修改。</p>
<p>憲法第四十三條規定：「國家遇有天然災害，癘疫，或國家財政經濟上有大變故，須為急逮處分時，總統……依照緊急命令法，發布緊急會令，為必要之處置。」但未將共匪叛亂列入。這一條憲法若不加以修改，則將來依照憲法而產生的新政府，不是「為憲法而放棄戡亂」，就要「為戰亂而違背憲法」。這兩種可能的結果，都不是我們人民願望的。因為在前者，民主憲政必隨國家民族淪亡而毀滅；在後者，民主憲政在開始的階段，就有遠憲的事賓，決非我國民主之福。所以為了要「一面戡亂，一面行憲」起見，無黨派代表莫德惠氏等一千二百零一一位代表所提請制定動員戡亂時期臨時條款一案，其意義是非常重大的。</p>
<p>這個提案的最大特色，乃在不必修改憲法，僅增加一種臨時條款，至戡亂成功之後，立即失效。不僅可使政府有能，而且使行憲的政府也可以戡亂，雙方兼顧，在立法政策上是最恰當也沒有了。誠如憲法學權威王世杰所謂：『我們要行憲政府可以戡亂，戡亂政府可以行憲。』同時我們再翻閱美國的政洽史，第一次大戰期間，美國國會曾以特權授與威爾遜總統；第二次大戰期間，美國國會也曾以特權授與羅斯福杜魯門總統，計是一個絕好的先例，民主政制所以能適應非常事變，也靠這一點。我們相　償靑兩黨的代表，在贊成政府戡亂建國的大前提之下，決不會固執一己見，視憲法條歡為金科玉律，神聖不可侵犯，反對任何必要的修改的；對於莫氏的提案，必然也希望國大能鄭重審查，予以通過。</p>
<p>又憲法第二十七條，規定國民大會的職權：（一）選舉總統劃總統；（二）罷免總統副總統；（三）修改憲法；（四）複決立法院所提之憲法修正案。準此而論一、本屆國大的職權，只有兩種：（一）選舉總統劃總統；（二）修改憲法；而修改憲法在事實上又不無困難；因此太屆國大的任務也就只限於選舉總統副總統一項而已了。但是全國代表三千人，雲集首都，舉行大會，只許其投票選舉總統副總統，而不讓人民的代表過問國家大事，在經濟方面說，是勞民傷財；在情理方面說，也是行不通的。因此國大代表一致要求檢討國是；此事在法理上解釋，不免有遠　之嫌；但在國家多難之秋，怎能教國大代表緘口無言？所以張知本等八百七十一位代表所提修改國大職權一案，也是值得我們注意的。張氏主張增加國大兩項職權：（一）創制立法原則；（二）複決有關人民權利義務之法律。但是由我們看來，張氏的憲法修正案，實有重行考慮的必要。國民大會旣為代表全國國民行政權的機構，其職權當以四項民權為限，修正第二十七條，只要把「但響」改為「關於創制複決兩權，由國民大會制定辦法並行使之。」也就可以包括一切了。</p>
<p>要之，我們原不主張修改憲法，並不是說現行憲法盡善盡美，用不着修改，而是為了目前的政洽環境，應該避免引起新的政治糾紛；即使在事實上有非修改不可的地方，也該從長計議，面面顧到，茍能如此，則必能獲得反對修憲派的諒解。但願國大代表愼重將事！</p>

<h3>國大紀程　修憲護憲兩大壁壘</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕擭憲修憲原是二而一一而二的事，但是在這政治與法律混為一談的國大會堂裏，兩者却鮮明的成了想對的兩大壁畢。主張修憲的是希望把憲法上若干漏洞補起來，成為天衣無縫的好憲法，這不能不說是愛護憲法，自然這是居於法律的觀點。主張不修憲的，是怕憲法在忽迫之間草率從事的修改，有傷憲法的尊嚴，有礙憲法一整體的精神，這是護憲，但這應該說是屬於政洽性的，因為這部根本大法是黨派協商的生兒，照法說需要修改，照理說國民黨代表也要修改，但是有人反對修改，這是政治性的。</p>
<p>憲法審查　開了一整天的會，發言的下少，要求發言的更多，司是歸根結蒂，沒有跳出這兩大壁壘，儘管下午的大會主席張　書女十一再提醒大家，對授權總統的臨時條款及臨時國大的會期應先行討論，但仍然無效。上午反對修憲最力，而且說話最有條里的是呈文熙，他說：「就過去說，我反對，就現在說，我反對，就將來說，我還是反對」。這種堅强肯定的句子，　致若干反感，雖然是幾句話，却弄得會塲一個翻天覆地，等平靜了他才說：為什麼反對修憲的理由，第一，我們尊重孫中山先生的遺敎，第二，憲法裏已經確定了蔣主席的地位，第三，歐美各國憲法的精神，己經包括在內。其次他指出，當前最有力的輿論，亦均不主張修憲，如國民黨蔣總裁他不主張修憲，因為當前任是戡亂，民·靑兩黨也曾前後發表聲明，不主張修憲，而且這部憲法是救中國的良藥，是使中國走向民主之路的，並且曾獲得國際間的好評，所以不主張修改。周利生抨擊批評這部憲法，他說漏洞太多，不僅是國民大會部份，就是政府部份，說三　不是三權，說五權非五權，內閣制不像，總統制也不是，反之，立院·監院把國大的政權都拿去了。</p>
<p>主張護憲而不修憲的，大都提出憲法的尊嚴性來，似乎是牢不可破，不能輕易動搖，這些人大部份屬於國民黨的友黨，也就是民社黨和靑年黨，他們不同意修憲的最大動機，是這部憲法的制定曾經三黨經過很辛苦的協商所獲得的結果，假如今日遽然修改了，說不定對於他們原來參加到憲法裏去的主見和精神要喪元氣，所以無論如何，他們站在任何一個角度說，他們都不贊成修改，雖然這部憲法並不合於州理想，可是他們寗願守着他一成不變。</p>
<p>中張修憲的，大都是國民黨員，因為在制憲史上，他們並不是自卅五年十一月開幕的制憲國大開始，他們有悠久的歷史，有傳統一貫的精神，他們是並不願意破壞原有的一貫精神的</p>
<p>可是，這是今天我們在會塲上所看到的眞槍眞刀，實際上一股有力量的暗流在潛伏着，這是什麼，就是政治，政治，政治，蔣主席在為國，為民的前途着想，放棄一切成見，一再吿誡國民黨黨員，在大前提下要與友黨精誠合作，不必修改憲法，但若干黨員在法的觀點上，認為必需要修改的時候，就不免突破了這一般有力量的暗流，而形之於表面化了，這就是今日一整日會塲中的明槍暗箭，示過話說回來，谷正綱部長說得好，我們（指國民黨和民靑兩黨）已經站在反共戰綫上共同努力，對剿匪的完成。是的，我們得承認，大家並沒有把眞正的敵人忘記或是放棄。</p>
<p>在今天的會塲裏，一開始就曾經給了我們一個政治紛爭的塲面，雖然那僅僅是很小的一個開端，原來今天的主席長召集人第一名張知本，但是反對的聲浪很大，一度把會塲的秩序全破壞了，當時在塲的三黨首腦，立刻進行了洽商，再分別由陳布雷對國民黨黨員說明，余家　對靑年黨黨員告誡，徐傅霖對民社黨黨員勸導，一致說明不必意氣用事，由小事成大事，這一幕尖銳角度化的演出，居然能從喧囂的會塲立時冷靜下來，而繼續中張知本主席，平靜無事。濃重的火戰氣，濃重的政治氣息在會塲裏展開着，但是「剿共是我們當前最大的任務」，却是三黨一致公認的。（四月十六日於南京）</p>

<h3>菲總統羅哈斯病逝　心臟病猝發暴卒逝世前尙抨擊共產主義　副總統基里諾將昇任總統</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼拉十六日電〕菲律賓總統羅哈斯昨夜在馬尼拉西北五十哩美空軍基地克拉克機塲以心臟病發暴卒，享年五十六歲。暴卒前曾發表激烈演說，抨擊共產主義，心臟病發於午後二時三十分，延至十時十分不洽身死，今晨由總統府報喪，遺體正用專車運回馬尼拉。副總統兼外長基里諾現年五十二歲將依法升任總統。基氏現正乘船在菲律賓中部休假，在宿霧附近接到總統逝世之無綫電報吿。羅哈斯病發後曾由美國軍醫會同菲律賓名醫費拉雷馬施用氧氣念救，總統之私人醫生薛松亦自馬尼拉乘飛機趕到。總統夫人及太夫人等亦即趕到機塲。總統在美國第十三空軍司令歐朋克宿舍壽終時，家人均隨侍在側。羅哈斯之逝世雖出意外，但其患心臟病則已歷有年所。日軍佔領時代任外交部長時，即托病避免種種不愉快任務。去年在公開演說中曾遭人狙擊倖免於難，一人替死，六人受傷。十一月團會競選運動時患病，作長其休息。本星其三夜間。羅氏曾在總統府慶賀美大使奧尼爾誕辰及本人結婚廿七週年紀念，直至午夜後始散。昨晨羅氏乘火車至克拉古機塲，檢閱美空軍操演，並向美國軍官與菲律賓名流五百人演說，聽衆歡聲如雷。其警語謂，「世界各國愛好自由之民族均不欲戰爭，但局勢惡化至極端時，將不得已而一戰，以維護自由」，演說畢數分鐘宿疾復發，原定步兵檢閱節目臨時取消。</p>

<p>〔聯合社馬尼拉十六日電〕殯軍一列今日載故總統羅哈斯遺體來此驚呆與哀慟之首都，屍體僅覆以國旗。羅哈斯夫人哀不自勝，由參議員議長亞凡里諾扶之下車，並由其愛女露培攙入汽車，其時車站附近羣衆擁擠，警察及總統衛隊阻止觀衆迫近月合。遺體由衛隊抬入救護車，軍樂隊矣輓歌與國歌。羅夫人趨前揭起國旗一吻亡夫之額。儀仗隊旋開始緩緩向馬拉卡南總統府行。</p>

<p>羅哈斯小史</p>
<p>菲總統羅哈斯是一個美國型的人物，一八九二年生於菲律賓中部班尼島北海風喀卑茲省省會，父親因參加反西班牙革命而被處死刑，這是他幼年所遭遇的家庭悲劇。</p>
<p>自一九〇〇年開始，美國在菲律賓傳播美國敎育，羅哈斯是接受那種敎育的第一代人。他最初在本城公立學校讀書，繼入馬尼刺高級學校，十七年進入菲律賓大學，專攻法律。羅哈斯在學校時，成續優越，再加以敎師們的誘導與鼓勵，激發他成為人民領袖的雄心。他在美籍敎師的薰陶下，不僅是學問上的學習，還獲得了美國的民主思想。</p>
<p>一九一三年至一七年在菲律賓司法總長公署任職，一九二二年起當選為衆議院議長，迄一九三四年卸職，雖然羅哈斯在菲島政治舞台上，那時他担任次要的角色，但前總統奎松早巳認識了他，認為他是最理想的繼承人。</p>
<p>一九四六年，羅哈斯在大選中擊敗了奧斯敏，當選總統。那年七月四日，菲律賓共和國正式宣吿成立，羅哈斯遂成了第一任大一總統。</p>
<p>羅哈斯是熟悉美國的人，比美國人還熟悉些。過去，他以獨立使節團團長的名義，數度訪問美國，會在國會演說，向美國人廣播，予美國人以深刻而良好的印象。在菲律賓獨立史上，羅哈斯是和奎松，奧斯敏並立的三大偉人。所以羅哈斯的逝世，不僅是菲國人民失去了一個領袖，而且也是遠東太平洋的一大損失，（本報資料室）</p>

<h3>甲種義屋劵開獎　得主今起換證書　售劵總收入千七百餘億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕冬令救濟會甲種房屋義賣劵，昨日下午二時在陝西南路市體育館開獎，出席負責人吳市長，王先靑，袁文彰。監察人江蘇監察使署代表王士緯，地檢處首席檢察官黃亮，市政府代表王冠靑，市參議會代表項昌權，市政協會代表奚玉書等。各界市民前往旁觀者，較乙種劵開獎時更多，估計約有三千餘人。</p>
<p>開獎之機器仍為乙種劵開獎時之原物，係向中央儲蓄會借來，開獎方式亦仍與上次相同，即用三個搖獎球，第一球丙球內裝「天地元黃」等五十字，第二球乙球內裝〇〇至一一等十二個號碼，為義賣劵號碼之前列二字，第三球甲球內裝〇〇〇至九九九等一千個號碼，為義賣券號碼之後列三字。三球搖出後合併之結果，即為中獎字號。</p>
<p>開獎程序改善三點</p>
<p>惟因上次乙種劵開獎後，曾有市民寫信給吳市長，認為有幾點程序未臻妥善，昨日乃臨時請記者三人担任開球並分別改善，以昭鄭車：（一）有人以為開出之號碼，僅由冬救會職員報吿，可能發生錯誤或其他情形，昨日乃將搖出之字號球再經監察人與新聞記者過目。（二）有人懷疑宇號球軍量是否一樣，昨日乃特備小磅稱一架，當塲試騐輕軍確屬相等。（三）有人恐怕將號碼倒唸，昨日乃將號碼球之號碼下加劃一綫，以免倒唸。</p>
<p>市長報告決不欺騙民眾</p>
<p>開獎程序，首先由吳市長報吿上述改善辦法，並稱：「乙種劵中獎之得主大部份已來登記，他們都與冬令救濟會毫無關係，由此可見決無弊竇。我做事與政府做事都要對民衆樹立信用，決不欺騙民衆。」繼由總幹事王先靑報吿甲種券已全部售出，截至中午十二時收到劵款一一九九億五一八〇萬元，未收券款計四八二〇萬元。乙種券售出五十萬另四一六九張，收到劵款五〇四億一六九〇萬元。劵款總額共一七〇四億一六九〇萬元。甲種預約憑單未掉換者一一九八張，計五九六〇萬元，乙種預約單未掉換者九二七張，計九二七〇萬元。義賣劵及預約憑單收入總額一七〇五億六九二〇萬元。</p>
<p>報吿畢，乃由監察人檢查搖獎球及號碼球。關　號碼球之重量由監察使署王士緯地檢處黃亮等分別揀出數球試驗，均屬相等。市長乃請黃檢察官在麥克風前向觀衆報吿。黃未及考慮措詞，說了句「大概很準確」，看台上觀衆中有人喊出「大槪兩字不妥」，黃連忙解釋，同時請觀衆中推代表朱傑一人到搖獎台前親身試驗，確屬重量相等，始釋羣疑。檢查完畢後乃開始搖獎，由吳市長親自搖出第一組中獎號碼，為「洪」字。一〇三四號，至四時十分全部搖畢，最後一組為「成」字〇七三五九號。全部中獎號碼列誌如前。</p>
<p>續辦問題在考慮中</p>
<p>〔又訊〕甲種房屋劵中獎人今日起即可至市商會五樓冬令救濟會房屋義賣部登記換取「收屋證書」，據吳市長談：此次房屋義賣劵辦理結果，旣可救濟難民，復能解決房荒，成續甚佳。惟是否擬續辦第二期，現尚在考慮之中，將來如能實現，或將另組一專門機構辦理云。</p>

<h3>五九日環蝕　白晝如黃昏　中美專家赴莫千山準備觀測</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今年五月九日之日蝕，據中央研究院及天文台測定，為一種「日環蝕」。此種日環蝕不同於部份日蝕，屆時由地球上看去，月球正遮沒太陽正中，而僅瀾　出邊　一環。圓環部份在上海見到者為太陽之百分之十弱，故屆時不致唁如黑夜，僅似一陰霾之黃昏。本市環蝕時間為上午八時四十五分起至中午十二時〇六分止。我國其他地方能窺見者，為江蘇海門·吳江·浙江常山，德淸，江西興國，資溪，廣東遂溪，德慶，翁源等地。惟環蝕之能見度及時間俱各有差異。美國某大學已會同中央研究院派出專家赴浙江武康縣境莫干山一帶，作大規模觀則準備。渠等企岡利用此次日蝕機會，脫離地軸以觀測經度，將來經精密計算與若干次再度測定，即可明瞭渦去根據地心則得經度之差誤率，而加以最正確之校正。</p>

<h3>公用事業所需燃料　國行同意先予結匯　將研討五金及生活指數問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會公用事業調查委員會並因公用事業價格上漲劇烈，決議電請行政院考慮停止公用事業價格計算公式之繼續適用，恢復貽補政策，並請在中央未決定適當辦法以前，五月份起此項公式應即停止適用。昨據吳市長向記者表示：公用事業價格計算公式本身並無不善，問題在外匯彼動劇烈。現正設法就公用事業所需原料外匯，與國行張總裁商洽，請准予先結匯一個半月至二個月，以防上漲。張總裁對此原則已表同意。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕市公用局為謀穩定公用事業價格，前日曾召集各電力公司代表初步交換意見。各代表認為欲穩定價格，惟有力謀减低成本，採取間接貼補辦法。公用局趙局長於昨晨十一時往訪張總裁，經晤談後，張總裁已同意本市公用事業所需燃料油外匯，准予先結匯一個半月。又燃管會方面亦可有一萬餘噸燃煤先售供公用事業使用。據趙局長向記者分析，影響公用事業價格之最大因素，除油煤外，尚有生活指數及五金指數。其中生活指數佔及各公司成本百分之四十二至六十之多。故欲謀穩定生活指數，需各方面一致採同一步驟進行，始能獲得成效。除油與煤外，五金指數問題將與熟悉五金業之人士詳為研究，生活指數亦將與有關機關交換意見，力謀穩定。至凍結五月份公用事業售價問題，站在公用局立場，自當以最大努力使之减低，以减輕市民負担。</p>

<h3>同濟學潮案判決　八被告各處徒刑　姑念年靑學子從輕量刑　馮立文等三人宣告無罪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動一時之同濟學潮，毆辱吳市長一案，昨晨九時地院宣判，胡之超推事蒞刑二庭後，即將各被吿自看守所中提出，胡推事起立宣讀判決書主文：「黃克魯，潘承邦，共同首謀，公然聚衆施强暴脅迫，各處有期徒刑六月。孫克　，瞿宇平，共同公然聚衆下手實施强暴脅迫，各處有期徒刑六月。王宗恕，王維新，張敬堯，周詠之，於公然聚衆施强暴脅迫時，共同在塲助勢，各處有期徒刑二月。馮立文，熊宗烈，王公衛均無罪。」繼坐下稱：「關於潘承邦部份，因同濟大學來　，稱潘在校時品學均優，並謂該生係本屆全國運動會上海市之排球代表，准交妥保。王宗恕，王維新，張敬堯，周詠之四被告之覇押期已超過刑期，故准交保，或責付在外。馮立文，熊宗烈，王公衛准交保或責付在外。其餘貢克魯，孫克孖，瞿宇平仍還押。」茲將該案判決理由節錄於後：</p>
<p>（一）黃克魯·潘承邦部分：</p>
<p>被吿黃克魯為同濟學生自治會常設委員，並為中席團之一，被吿潘承邦為該自治會常務理事，亦為主席團之一，並與黃克魯同為請願團主席，均經當庭自承，一月二十九日之請願，旣以主席團為首腦，則學生之前衝後退，必主席團為其首謀，此觀吳虹在警局所稱「衝出校門是主席團發令的一（見偵查下卷四十頁）而益明。雖此次請願出於各科系代表之議決，交由主席團執行，不能認為出自被吿煽惑，然明知軍警電重包圍，阻止前進，猶命令前衝，故使當時當地之秩序陷於紊亂，自應共負公然聚衆施强暴脅迫首謀之責，依刑法第一百五十條後段論罪。被吿瀋承邦除首謀妨害秩序外，復下手實施强暴，美經朱一夫先後在偵查及審判中指證。該被吿以首謀而兼下手實施强暴，應依首謀論科，惟被吿等均係年靑學子，受一時感情衝動，爰予量刑從輕。</p>
<p>（二）孫克孖·瞿宇平部分：</p>
<p>查黃克魯在警局述稱：「市長被毆確是事實，」被吿孫克孖跨過溝來毆打市長，不惟朱一夫指證明確，即被告孫克孖對警局問以「警察逮捕照相學生時，你曾大聲質問市長，氣勢凶凶，不聽豔阻這事有嗎？」亦　以「有的，這是對市長不瞌貌之盧，現在我承認錯了，」在審判中亦承認「講話不禮貌」，，以此參觀互證，其曾經施用强暴，可以概見。被吿瞿宇平曾經動手毆打吳市長，亦經張聚恭先後在偵查及審判中到案結證，自不容其否認。總核被告二人之行為，維非以妨害公務為目的，而對之實施强暴，但旣公然集合多人，並具有隨時增加之狀况，即已具備刑法公然聚衆條件，又不遵地方行政長官之命解散，反蜂擁向前，共同下手實施强暴，顯係意圖擾亂當時秩序，與刑法第一百五十條後段之規定相符，爰依妨害秩序罪論科，姑念該被吿等年靑初犯，量刑亦予從輕。</p>
<p>（三）王宗恕王維新張敬堯周詠之部分：</p>
<p>甲，被吿王宗恕雖非請顧團負責人，縱不能證明其如何下手實施强暴，其在塲助勢，要無可疑。</p>
<p>乙，被吿王維新為請願團總指揮，業經當庭自承，並經周植榆指證，雖不能證其如何實施强暴脅迫，然其在塲助勢，亦無可疑。　丙，被吿張敬堯在警局自承手持請願棋向包圍警士前衝，當時被捕，雖不能遽認為下手實施强暴，究難辭在塲助勢之責。</p>
<p>丁，被吿周詠之旣自承當時在溝邊立於第三大隊之前，朱一夫又謂其衝過溝來，則其在塲助勢，殆無可疑。</p>
<p>總上而論，被吿四人，即應依刑法第一百五十條前段論科，惟其犯罪動機係一時情感所激動，旦又年靑在學，應予從輕量刑，以示寬大。</p>
<p>（四）馮立文熊宗烈王公衛部分：</p>
<p>被吿馮立文於吳市長提議五人會議調處後，即往請校友黃伯榫，及其持黃伯樵名片回隊宣讀時，即發生紊亂，則其未參加主席團前衝謀議，可以概見：故應諭知無罪。被吿熊宗烈雖曾喊「同學們不要灰心」之口號，然據稱係事後夜間在二樓敎室所喊，實難遽予論罪。被吿王公衛雖有光復中學學生胡麗萍在偵查中證其毆打市長，然同濟學生杜成樑，李大賓一致證明衝突當時王公衛在廚房門前，朱一夫又當庭述稱「王公衛沒有看見」，張聚恭亦鄭重述稱「那個姓王的左眼瞎的，沒有打市長，我沒有說他打市”長」等語，朱張二人當日始終在吳市長左右，見聞較確，其證言自較胡麗萍所述為可採，故亦諭知無罪。據上論結合依刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，第二百九十二條，第二百九十三倏第一項，刑法第二十八條，第一百五十條，判決如主文。</p>

<p>昨晨糖市，進後復退，初以低盤開做，十六期粗砂棧單，後天交割僅加四十八萬元，後忽盛傳外匯行將掛高，市遂一哄而上，加至五十七萬元。下週一期竟加七十萬元，終以謠言成為泡影，人心重趨軟化，價乃緩步下降。後日期仍加五十萬元，為四九四萬元，與昨軋平。下週一期計加六十萬元。</p>

<h3>客銷轉暢買氣略振　棉紗布大部回堅</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，穩中帶堅，謠傳外匯有再度掛升之說，各方人心略趨振作。二十一支雙馬晨開即突破一億四工萬關，自一億四千一百萬開出，曾盤升至一億四千四百萬。臨收浮多有吐稍見回落，終以一億四千三百萬收市，回挺四百萬。四二支除藍鳳軋挫三百萬外，餘均供求相捋，鮮見上落。三二支各級複製業略有進胃，市價大部回升一百萬至三百萬之間。二〇支雙馬等客銷去化趨暢，本街亦有收納，市價大部上升二，三百萬。十六支及十支各檔，亦堅一百五十萬至三百萬不等。</p>

<h3>五金公會要求變更　輸入分配限額辦法</h3>
<p>本市五金商業公會，昨以五金輸入限額分配辦法，未能公允，影響生產工廠之成本增加，特呈呈請輸入會工輔處，要求變更分配辦法。茲抄錄其理由如下：</p>
<p>（一）現行五金輸入限額之配與販賣者，計為限額總數百分之五十。其分配辦法則由各進口商行承定之。過去進口商代客定貨，係採取佣金制度，其合法利潤，鮮有超過百分之十以上。今則利用輸入限額，及政府給予外匯，而一變其昔日之經營方式。為校正前項弊病，應實行下列二點：（甲）照上海工協會分酣工廠外匯例，五金輸入限額之配與阪賣商者，應由有關販賣商同業公會集議分配，決不可任令進口商一業自由分配，以遂其予取予求之私願。（乙）進口商代客定貨，須於政府給予外匯時，規定合法利潤。五金商向進口商訂貨，轉售工廠用戶時，亦規定合法利潤。</p>
<p>（二）現行申請非限額輸入貨品，規定須有工廠簽證。但實際上難行之處甚多，即勉强行之，亦有不實不盡之弊。如各工廠所需要某種工具或某種配件，（如軍刀鋼鑽頭砂等）其尺寸不同，式樣互別，需要時期又不能盡同，而進口商行向國外廠商定貨，一動非數十件或數百打不可。若聯合各廠簽訂定購單，勢不可能。若以一廠之名簽訂定購單，則非虛搆事實，發生流弊不可。尤以外埠及農村發生需要時，動輒向隅，以致輸入物資供應失常。為解除前項困難，以使物資供應圓滑計，擬請變更辦法，准予該會會員逕行申請由商業公會簽證，較為合理而切實際。</p>

<h3>馮景祥不去　讓給吳祺祥　胡好請王新衡諒解</h3>

<h3>公貨改獎學金　教部有所說明　原有公費生偽給至畢業時為止　資金生以考試成績優良者為限</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕聞敎部近應有關方面之邀約，商討整頓學風問題，本報記者今晚特訪敎部田培林次長，承吿謂：敎部因國大代表來京開會，乃輿代表中之各大學校長，商討公費生問題。按公費生辦法，起於抗戰時期，勝利復員後，即應取消·去年參政會議亦主修改公費制度，經行政院汍定改為獎學金。故自去年八月以後，除師範生與靑年軍復學及邊疆學生規定發給公費外，其餘均無公費，只有獎學金。原有公費生仍給至畢業為止·此外為救濟家在匪區學生，訂有救濟金辦法。獎學金給至畢業為止，救濟金則給至學生家鄉收復後三個月即行停止。獎金生以考試學生優良成績者為準，故大學一年級新生，如符合獎學金辦法，即可獲得獎金，惟不似從前公費生之普及。惟因公費生名頗與改制後之獎學金名額相同，故外界多所誤會，以為獎學金則是公費。此後當由部正式說明此項辦法，以正視聽。朱部長十四日曾向國民大會報吿公費事項，巳有詳徹閘述。朱部長强調稱：世界各國從無完全供給大學生伙食之辦法，在中國義務敎育還沒有普及之時，人民的血汗不拿去推廣小學方面的義務敎育，而以供給大學生為伙食，此事非但甚不介理，而且太不公平！</p>

<h3>漢譯馬鳴佛所行讚的名稱和譯者</h3>
<p>— 周一良</p>
<p>記載釋迦牟尼一生事迹的經典中，最早的有後漢竺大力康孟群譯的修行本起經。然後吳支謙譯有太子瑞應本起經，西晋竺法護譯有普曜經，劉宋求那跋陀羅譯有過去現在因果經，隋關那崛多譯有佛本行集經，唐地婆訶羅譯有方廣大莊嚴經，趙宋法賢譯有衆許摩訶帝經。道些經典叙述的方式各有不同。有的從釋迦族的悉達太子降生叙起，有的從釋迦族的祖先叙起。又有的從釋迦牟尼前生作婆羅門名呌善憲，遇見燃燈佛初發菩提心講起。還有的從天地開癖說起。因為傳受不同，內容互異，在佛敎史的研究上各有其地位。但要從文學眼光看來，以上所舉都不算重要，最重要的兩部是劉宋賓雲譯的佛本行經和相傳北凉　無讖譯馬鳴的佛所行讚。這篇小文要討論的便是後者漢譯的原名和譯者。</p>
<p>佛所行讚是浩如烟海的漢譯大藏經中梵文原本還存在的僅有幾部之一。漢譯藏譯都有二十八品，可惜原文部只賸下前半的十四品。奇怪的是發現的幾個寫本都只到第十四品的中段為止，似乎後半早已失去。E．B．Cowell氏所校訂的本子到第十七品，但經考定，第十四品後半以後都是後人所補，不是馬鳴原文。現在最好的版本，要算印度旁遮普大學東方叢書第三十一種E．H．Johnston氏校訂並附英譯的本子。佛所行讚在印度文學史上，屬於宮廷詩Kauys一類。據說這種詩裏一定要講到統治國家和作人的道理，要描寫女人，要描寫打仗，並且要用比較彫琢文飾的字句。佛所行讚這幾點上都成功地作到。治國家和作人的道理由優陀夷說出，見離欲品。歐息品叙述太子出游時女子們爭先恐後的搶着看，離欲品叙述太子夜間在宮中看見采女們睡眠時的種種相。對於女人的服飾，動作和心理有極細膩周到的描寫。不過中譯本刪去很多，大槪認為與經典的莊嚴不合，不知梵文原本本來是「詩」而不是「經」也。至於字句的修飾與彫琢，尤其印度文人最喜用的兩個辦法—一是想入非非的響喻，一是利用音同義異的字來游戲更更是觸目皆是。但漢譯限於語言，對於第二點不能表達耳。關於佛所行讚的總評，我們可以引義爭的話作代表。他說馬鳴「並作佛本行詩，大本若譯有十餘卷。意述如來始自王宮，終乎雙樹。一代佛法並輯為詩。五天南海無不諷誦。意明字少，而攝義能多。復令讀者心悅忘倦。」（南海寄歸內法傳卷肆讚詠之禮條）</p>
<p>讀了義凈的話之後，於是發生兩個問題。第一是佛所行讚漢譯的時代問題。他說「大本若譯有十餘卷」，似乎還不曾翻譯成中文。但梁代僧祐所編的出三藏記集卷貳早巳著錄，無疑就是我們現在所見的譯本。何以博洽如義凈反好像沒看見呢？高楠順次郎氏譯寄歸傳的注釋跟平等通昭氏的梵文佛傳文學研究對這問題都未能解答。我覺得僧祐的記載自然可信，或者義凈在南海者書時行　中所携經典不多，遂失檢照吧？也許他僅是要說明書的分量，所以言「若譯」？第二個問題比較重要也比較複雜，就是佛所行讚漢譯的名稱與譯者的問題。梁僧祐出三藏記集卷貳有「佛所行讚五卷」，注云「一名馬鳴菩薩讚，或云佛本行讚」。譯者是劉宋時竇雲。（參看卷抬伍寶雲傳）卷肆又有「佛本行經五卷」，在失譯雜經錄裏，就是說不知道譯者。隋法經的衆經目錄卷貳有「佛本行讚經傳七卷，宋元嘉年寶雲譯」，又有「佛所行讚經傳五卷，一名馬鳴讚，晋世竇雲譯」。費長房的歷代三賓記卷玖有「佛本行經五卷」是曇無鐵譯。卷拾有「佛所行讚經五卷」，竇雲禪。書道宜大唐內典錄和三賓記相同。武周時明佺大周刊定衆經目錄卷五大乘重譯經目中有「佛本行經一部五卷」，　無讖澤，又有「佛本行經一部七卷」，竇雲譯。智昇開元釋敎錄卷四　無讖譯經有」佛所行讚經傳五卷」。注云：「或云經，無傳字。或云傳，無經字。馬鳴菩薩造。亦云佛本行經，見長房錄」。卷五實雲譯經有「佛本行經七卷」，注云「或云佛本行讚傳，於六合山寺出。或云五卷，見僧祐賢唱內典等錄。高僧傳云佛本行讚經」。諸家所記經名譯者與卷數多舛互不同，莫可究詰。常盤大定氏在他的後漢至宋齊譯經總錄（頁九一〇）裏說：「僧祐以佛所行讚為寶雲譯，似乎可從。而曇而無讖所譯者，蓋當從費長房說，即祐錄之佛本行經也」。他這話也只是揣測之詞，並無證據。</p>
<p>我們細看以上所引各家目錄的文字，知道卷數的多少或由於鈔寫時數字的錯誤，或由於寫經時因紙的關係，而卷的數目有增减。如歷代三實記卷九說「洛陽伽籃記五　」，而注中又說：「或為大卷」。自然併成一大卷者字或者小些，紙或者長些。於是同為一書而有五卷一卷之別。又如巴黎所藏伯希和三四二號寫本（據淸華圖書館藏照片）是一個寺廟的帳目，有一部分是「經目錄」。其中有「雜資藏經八卷」「佛本行經六卷」，都與現在所傳卷數不合。大槪也是根據實際寫本卷軸數且的記錄，而非原分卷數。所以上引各家經錄中卷數之差我們可以暫不去管他。經名的「本行」或「所行」意義相同，亦可不論。或稱「經」或稱「傳」也都是原文所無，中譯隨意加上，可以除外。我們現在要據以推論的最可靠的根據，是這「讚」字的有無。</p>
<p>法經的目錄裏兩部經只是一所」和「行」一字之差，而且都作寶雲譯。明佺的目錄都稱為「佛本行經」，並且說和附閣那崛多譯的佛本行集經都是「同本別譯」，可謂睜着眼說瞎話！佛本行經與佛所行讚固非一書，和龐大的佛本行集經尤其無干，豈可目為「同本」？所以這兩部目錄的記載也不值得討論。，為眉目淸楚起見，我把其餘四部經錄的說法表表列於下：</p>
<p>從上列的表看來，我們知道從梁代到唐初，一直認為寶雲所譯的呌作「行讚」，另一部呌「行經」。這個最早的說法我認為是對的。換言之，就是現在的「佛本行經」原名該是「佛所行讚」，而「佛所行讚」該是「佛本行經」。理田何在呢？</p>
<p>馬鳴的詩的梵文原名為名為Buddhacarita，可以譯成「佛所行或「佛本行」，但沒有「經」或「讚」之類的意味在裏面。義淨稱它為「佛本行詩」，極為正確。中譁可能加上個『經』字，因為當它晨敎內聖典。但沒有理由稱它為「讚」，因為全篇是釋迦牟尼的傳記，毫無「讚」的功用·再看今本佛本行經，則大有被稱為「讚」的資格。開宗明義的因綠品記如來湼槃後，諸天請金剛力士追述佛德。力士說：「欲歎佛功德，無能盡具者。願承佛威神，令意不謬誤。能少少頒宣，歎佛之德善」。歏猶讚也。第二品為「稱歏如來品」，略述如來一事迹。本品為八王分舍利，又說：「時密跡力士，廣為諸天人，以次說是法，宣佛本行德。……假令諸羅漢，慧如舍利弗，壽劫歡佛德、不能令終竟。况吾智淺末，限陳所見聞」。這豈不是澈頭澈尾的一部「佛所行讚」嗎？</p>
<p>以上證明今本—行經」應當原名「行讚」。這部經道宣以前都目為　雲譯，智昇始說是曇無鐵譯。書名問題解決，譯者問題怎樣呢？我認為也應以僧祐之說為是。第一當然是因為時地相接。寶雲卒於宋元嘉二十六年（公元四四九年），僧祐卒於梁大監十七年（公元五一八年），相去不久。賓雲降經於六合，在南朝境內。僧祐　於寶雲的工作自應淸楚。還有別的證據說朋這部原名行讚今名行經的著作不是曇無議所諱。梵本經典的辭譯往往是大竺或西域譯主口授，再由別人記下來。因為經過這稱層次，很不容易從譯本的行文風格或遺詞用字上來考察譯者的個性。但專名的音譯理應較為回定。同一譯者在譯不同的經典時，似乎對同樣的專名應該用同樣的漢字來迻寫，現在似定都從梵文本譯出，比較實雲行經裏和曇無譯金光明經大般湼槃經所見的若干專名的音譯，列如下表。便　行經不出　　　手，智昇的說法完全不對了。</p>
<p>今本行經旣應原名行讚，並且知道是劉宋時竇雲所譯，則今本行讚譯者的問題也就解決了一半。它不會也出寶雲之手，因為兩者的專名迻寫頗不相同。試看下表</p>
<p>法經與明佺認為兩等都是竇雲譯，自不可信了。費長房和道宣所主張的今本行讚為壘無纖譯的說法，我覺也大有可疑。慧皎高僧傳以及他所根據的僧祐出三藏載記集中的曇無讖傳記載讖所譯經，大集湼盤槃諸經固無論，悲華海龍王等經也都記載，獨不及馬鳴此作。如出讖手，這樣重要經典絕不應兩人都漏略的。行讚的譯音如「羅喚羅」「阿修羅」等，倒是和　無讖其他譯相合。不過項數太少，不够作根據。從僧祐　皎的曇無讖傳的默證看來，我們還是相信出三藏記集，認為馬鳴的「佛本行詩」是「失譯」，恐怕最為妥當了。（三十七年三月十四日寫於淸華園）</p>
<h3>梨園世說序</h3>
<p>— 吳鈴</p>
<p>張涵銳先生把他的「梨園世說」稿本拿來給我看，要我寫幾句話，這是一樁義不容辭的事。</p>
<p>我細心地從頭到尾讀過一遍。這部稿本有二百二十葉，每半頁是六百個字，總計起來，全書的字數要在二十五萬以上。材料的來源，也就是他所參考過而且引用了的書籍，至少有四百種，裏面許多都是非常冷僻的難得之本。這種工作比張次溪氏的纂輯「淸代燕都樂園史料』正續兩編，周明泰氏的鈔印「清昇平署存檔事例漫鈔』等書，要艱難得多；因為「淸代燕都梨園史料』只是一種搜集書籍的工作，「淸昇平署存檔事一例漫鈔』只是一種謄錄資料的工作。這部『梨園世說』雖然和前面所舉出的兩部書籍同樣是所謂燒磚瓦而不是建築房屋的，但，却需要最沉着的耐性，最長久的時間，最淵博的學識和最聰明的抉擇。我個人有過　一點編製劇曲目錄的經驗，往往耗費許多天的時間去查考一部書籍，結果竟找不出一條名目，有的時候找到而不能斷定鑑別，這正像金沙江岸的淘金工人，甘苦惟有自己眞正了解。張涵銳先生在這見引用了的書籍至少有四百種，然而他可能繙檢過一千種以上，我這樣說，他一定會莫逆於心的。事實呢，金子從淘金工人的手裏轉移到了金店，經過千錘百鍊之後，給女人們增添了種種莊嚴。用了這麼大的功力所成的書籍也只是供給學者專家們現成的材料，讓他們裝點煌煌巨箸的羽毛。那麼，為什麼不自己直接來寫？這就是我們對於張涵銳先生這樣的工作態度所以永遠表示感激的綠由。致力耕耘而不問收穫的人愈多，專門從事為人之學而不自私自傲的人愈多，學衛的前途纔能憧憬光采。同時，我們對於這部書籍的重視也和別的類似箸作有着顯明的差異。就時間來講，它所包含的材料不是某一個時期或者朝代所能限制得住，而是從遠古一直到近代的。就空間來講，它所決定的範囿也不只是永嘉的戲文和大都的雜劇，而是一切可能爬梳和鈎勒出的富有區域性的鄉土戲的面貌之資料儘量收容在內。所謂『梨園』兩個字乃是廣義的：音樂，舞蹈，歌曲，戲劇，全都算數；戲劇方面還不單是專收劇本及作家的品題，作品內容的考證，而最着眼於舞台演出和優伶私生活的紀錄，這和前人的曲話有了顯　　　野，和專給優伶做起居注的菊　相較則又嚴肅得多。跳出王國維氏「優語錄」和任納氏『新曲苑』的圈子，使研究俗文學而致力方向不同的學者可以隨着自己特殊的需要去選擇，去利用，省却無理查書時間的浪費。</p>
<p>至於這書所以呌做「梨園世親」的原因，乃是張涵銳先生排列材料的方法跟蹤劉義慶的世說新語。它一共分做六十三個主題，那是，考際，辨證，佳話，吉期，愆尤，侮弄，鬥毆，判斷，仕宦，商買，哀悼，笑謔，選拔，釋放，故事，舊章，宴會，賞賜，禁格，彈劾，傳述，徵引，離別，題贈，詼諧，嫉妬，遊戲，惑溺，壽考，凶亡，災禍，背叛，徵調，捐輸，鬼神，妖孽，部署，紀載，議論，對偶，楹聯，燈瞇，雜錄，餘談，詞曲，　圖，勸戒，嗜好，才華，技藝，禪悅，諫諍，譏諷，彌縫，假冒，癡騃，詐賺，修飾，結東，品評，凌辱，感跑，矜詡。同類的材料伴繫在侮個主題的下面。張涵銳先生的分類做得相當細心，所以找不着一條材料重見兩處的毛病。但是，我們求全責備之處也就是分類方法這一點。這不是新舊的問題，是讓別人利用這書方便與否的問題。這種分類方法似乎只是輯者個人了解材料內容的主觀印像，沒有一個客觀的標準做尺度。硬定部居，主題可以不受數字的限制；說是分類，實際等於不管。一條材料能够同時分繫到一個似上的主題下面去；許多條同事，同人，同劇的材料又被打散而不能集中在一塊。讀者把這書當做茶餘酒後的消遣，當然不會挑剔這稱現象，我想輯者決不能把這書的貢戲估計得那麼謙卑。但，讀者若想利用這書的優點，却首先遭遇到一個有力的人為攔阻。這書已經編集成功，重新整理在事實上決不可能，我願意提出一個微小的竟見，這竟見正是代表大部分讀者的願望。最好張涵銳先生能够在這書付日的時候加上一個專名索引和徽引書名索引，一方面填補了缺陷，而最重要的是，這種極度辛勤的工作必須收到它所盡責任的優良效果。</p>

<h3>李覯不喜孟子</h3>
<p>— 漆俠</p>
<p>這樣說來，　不等於說李觀對孟子的態度是非常矛盾的嗎？我想，這也不盡然，我們應當從李氏的思想發展過程上去求得一個解答。</p>
<p>大約在李觀的靑年和中年時期，雖已對孟子有些不滿意處，然而還是承認他在士大夫羣中所已經獲得的地位的。所以，當他二十三歲寫信給孫寺丞時，還將孟子列為羣聖人之一，而二十四歲著「禮論」時便對孟子性善之說提出了異議。在二十八歲所著的「平土書」中對孟子「周人百畝而徹」的話頗不調然，而在三十五歲所著的「周禮致太平論」中却又徵引了孟子很多的話作為立論的根據·可見在這些時候，李氏對於孟子雖巳加以批判，也還在加以攝取，還不會對孟子採取全然反對的態度，自然也還沒有以反對孟子知名於世。所以當慶曆三年冬（李年三十五）祖無擇為李氏的文集作序，還以李氏比孟子，說「盱江李泰伯其有一孟軻氏六君子之深心一焉。」而皇祐元年（李年四十一）范仲淹薦舉李氏於朝，其奏童中也說「李觀著書立言，有孟軻揚雄之風義。」如果李氏這時已對孟子加以全稱否定，社會上都已知道李氏是反孟子最力的人物，則祖無擇和范仲淹這些話，豈不全成了對李氏的一種諷刺了嗎？</p>
<p>李氏反對孟子最厲害的一些話，全在他的「常語」當中，而常語是在他四十五歲那一年寫的。大約在他四十歲後，反對孟子的傾向愈來愈甚，便於常語一書中盡量發洩了出來。在這時期之內，李氏日常向人談話，必也不免對孟子盡情詆諆，於是什百相傳，李氏遂以「反孟專家」馳名於世了。</p>

<h3>恭請配給水電</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>前幾天看見報上說社會局有增加配給品種類的計劃，還成立了一個什麼生活指數編制問題研究會，顧名思義，足見生活指數之編制，業已頗成「問題」了。該會「研究」了這幾天，「研究」出什麼結果來了沒有，目前尚未分曉，看上去總要到月底發表指數的時候，才能叫人家充份領略這幾位先生「研究」的份量。但是有一點却似乎已無疑問：社會局方面以為如果能够配給布（包括坏布及色布），食鹽，醬油，木柴，火柴，襪子，紙烟，肥皂等八種配給品後，就可以使生活指數「穩定」。</p>
<p>本來呢，暮春十一一月，風和日暖，再要說「凍結」的話，未免與時令欠合；「穩定」二宇就見得圓通漂亮，四時成宜，理應拈出來贊美一番，即此一筆表過不提。</p>
<p>不態在下一天報上，却看見本市總工會不承認這個「指數問題研究會」的消息。據總工會發言人稱：總工會並未被邀出席這個研究會，又說，「若因該會之活動所產生之結果，對生活指數有任何影響，工人無接受之義務。如配給生活必需品，則總工會甚表歡迎。」（四月十四日本報）</p>
<p>關於生活指數如果有什麼新的決定，當然最直接受到影響的是全上海的工友，「研究」這樣一個「問題」而竟沒有邀請總工會派員出席，的確也難怪總工會要存戒備之心了。</p>
<p>不過，配給生活必需品也的確是一樁很好的事情，而生活指數如果能以物價之穩定而穩定的話，當然更是我們全市老百姓所衷心渴望的。問題是，配給了這些布，鹽，油，木柴，火柴，襪子，紙烟，肥皂之後，物價是否就可以穩定下來呢？</p>
<p>這是一個重要的問題，如果我們所企求的是眞正的安定，那麼我們就應當憑自己的良心來「研究」這個問題。</p>
<p>我們旣要「研究」如何穩定物價，何妨先看看物價是怎樣漲起來的呢。我們就看這個「指數問題研究會」成立前三天的報紙罷，而且不必詳引數字，藉免充字數騙稿費之譏，我們祗看一看那天（四月十日）本報本埠版的頭條標題：</p>
<p>水電煤氣電話新價</p>
<p>會商核定昨起實行</p>
<p>電話幾漲一倍餘為六五至七十</p>
<p>反應强烈午後物價俱升</p>
<p>好一個「反應强烈午後物價俱升」，眞是「靈不靈當塲試驗」！我們有沒有看見過那一天的報上說，「食　火柴漲價，反應强烈，午後物價俱升」的消息？</p>
<p>穩定物價，好；穩定生活指數，也好。我們屢次恭讀過社會局公用局兩位局長在市參議會的施政報吿和對參議員質詢的答辭，深信這兩位都是痌　在抱的好官淸官，我們做老百姓的現在祗想請靑天老爺開開恩，可否援配給米之例，水電也平價配給了罷！</p>
<p>否則，在奉贈萬民傘時，金光燦爛的「為民先鋒」四個大字下面，就不得不加上小小一個括弧了，括弧裏面，是用全上海老百姓的血和汗寫的「漲價」二字。</p>
<h3>雙頭怪女</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>去年，上海會出現過一個雙頭怪胎，利用他的身體上的畸形廉了一筆錢，可惜這個小生命不久就夭折了，除了「獻醜」之外，根本沒有享受過甚麼。類似的雙頭怪胎並不是絕無僅有的，不過，能够長大成人的却確是極少。在這稀罕的稀罕之中，美國的雙頭怪女米麗·克莉絲汀要算是　一個難得的例子。</p>
<p>米麗·克莉絲汀於一八五一年誕生於北卡洛林納州哥倫布郡，她的父母是一對黑人奴隸。她一出世就被從黑人的茅屋中送到她的父母的主人約瑟夫·斯密土的大廈中，斯密士如獲至竇，加意的照顧她，當她長大到十五個月的時候，斯密士就帶了她做週遊全美的旅行。</p>
<p>醫生和科學家都檢驗過米·麗克莉絲汀，他們都稱她為當代的怪物。她有兩顆頭，兩個肩膀，四隻手，四條腿，兩具肺，兩顆心，不過，就是僅有一個身體。</p>
<p>因為她近乎是兩個人被黏在一起，所以，她的主人又分別的給每個身體各取了一個名字：一個就呌米麗，另一個則呌克莉茜。米麗和克莉茜的主要的嗜好和習慣是相同的，她「倆」都愛好音樂，跳舞，和其他的娛樂，有過，她倆的見解却不完全一致，兩顆頭時常為了某一件事情而大起爭辯。</p>
<p>在另一方面，米麗和克莉茜却從不寂寞或者孤獨。她們的爭辯或者意見的分歧從未嚴重得破壞了她倆的愉快且舒服的共一同生活。</p>
<p>米麗的嗓子是中音，克莉茜唱的却是高音。從當時的音樂批評看來，她倆的合唱量動　　甜蜜的。她們左各一城　演出時，附近的　城　居民都空巷前往，足見轟動的一般。</p>
<p>當時的「星星那提調查報」對米麗·克莉絲汀曾說過一句幽默　「她可以做一個優良的陪審官，因為她能够同時看到兩方面。」</p>
<h3>陳石逸事</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>侯官陳石遺先生（衍），詩名滿天下。淸季首倡效法宋詩，乃「同光體」之領袖。光緒間，入張之洞幕府。時之洞總督兩湖，辦理新政，費用浩繁，公庫以竭。先生建議造銅圓，以裕國用。之洞用其言而物價因是高漲。今人但知銅圓創自之洞，不知其議實發自先生也。</p>
<p>先生深於經史，尤善論詩，著有石遺室詩話，付商務印書館出版。博大精深，得未曾有。當世詩人得其一言獎借，即可成名。而其篇幅之巨，亦為古今詩話所未有。後復成續編，則采援稍濫，不若正編之矜愼矣。議者每與隨園詩話相比，亦實錄也。</p>
<p>先生貌如秋潭老蛟，老而彌健，行走若飛，少年人侮膛乎其後。八十後尚乘飛機入蜀，游峨嵋山。且蓄二少年姬人，亦得天獨厚已。</p>
<p>先生晚年在蘇州作寓公，與章太炎金松岑輩文酒流連無虛日。每星期且赴無錫國學專修學校講學一日，至則與唐蔚芝師日夜鬨飲，未嘗見其醉也。</p>
<p>先生與陳散原鄭孝胥齊名，以散原比黃山谷，孝胥比陳簡齊，自比東坡。孝胥一海藏樓詩，先生且為之序；其交誼之篤可以知矣。孝胥投入偽滿洲國後商務重版石遺室詩話，刪去及於孝胥者，孝胥竟大憾，迨先生歿，因作挽詩，有曰：「石遺死去何所遺」。云云。極盡謾罵之能事，孝胥氣量之狹，於此可見。宜其出處之不能自審，而喪其早歲之聲名也。而先生固未嘗有一語議孝胥也。</p>
<h3>關於美國女人</h3>
<p>— 碩甫</p>
<p>據美國作家麥克辛邱吉爾在美利堅雜誌中發表的一篇文章中所示，假使一個美國女人的名字喚做瑪麗，身高五呎五吋，體重一百二十三磅，唸過八年半書，那末，她便是一個典型的美國女人。</p>
<p>另據有關美國女人的統計，發現她們的壽命較男子長久，結婚率却比男子小。即使以戰前而論，平均七個少女中，必有一駟「失　」。</p>
<p>目前，上大學去唸書的女人，在不斷增加中，她們結婚的機會，即見减少，因為大學畢業生女中，祇有三分之一是結婚的。她們求學的成績，却不輸於同級的男生。</p>
<p>一般說來，假定眞能找出一個典型的美國女人的話，她是具有康健，富有，聰明等優點的。</p>
<h3>漫談挽聯</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>凌齊漢閣謂對偶的文學為中華文字特擅之國粹，世界各國所無，誠屬確諭。但對偶文字，固以對聯為中華所獨有，而對聯中之挽聯一稱，尤為對聯中之特色，不第可以發表對於死者的哀思，並且可以賅括死者一生事業，於寥寥數語中表暴而出，世界各國，更無此種文學了。</p>
<p>挽聯最簡單峭勁的，只十四字，如凌霄漢閣所舉曾文正挽聯：「平生風義兼師友，萬古雲霄一羽毛。」即是十四字。此種挽聯，大都集古人成句為多，余曾見一友癖好圍碁，挽其常與對敵之友云：「正是江南好風景，聞道長安似弈碁。」其友適從蘇州而往北平亡故者，亦頗貼切。余挽徐樹錚云：「聲名鑠宇終遭忌，著述藏山定不刋。」雖援此例，而不能集成語也。</p>
<p>挽聯字句，不在太多，亦不在字面美好，以活潑生動，為能得味外味。范肯堂挽潘道士云：「是嘗從吾游焉，一鶴孤舟，千疊愁心在江上；今並斯人亡矣，隻雞斗酒，數行淸淚麗城南。」潘道士蓋為范之弟子，此聯極自然生動之致。</p>
<p>政見不同，而死後則嫌疑盡泯。楊晳子挽黃克强先生云：「公誼不忘私，平生政見分馳，肝膽至今推擊友。一身能敵萬，可惜霸才無命，死生從古困英雄。」楊晳子係洪憲籌安會中主腦人物，反對共和頗力，無可稱道，然此聯固是不凡。、</p>
<p>挽伶人聯，每每有許多感慨，如王澤山挽程長庚：「田舍奴我豈妄哉，　　曲當年，取不忘崔九堂前，歧王宅裏。廣陵一散自今絕矣，悵舊游何處，再休說貞元朝士，天寳宮人。」不僅琢對工穩，妙合自然，且能引起無限感槪。又有人挽譚呌天云；「此是何時，豈容有昇平雅頒？君歸大好，便當作供奉神仙。」當時譚稱老供奉，末句尤恰合譚之身分。譯之亡，在是年春杪，又有云：「聲容具稀世之長，於今南內無人，偏又是落荒時節；滄海下揚塵之淚，從此廣陵絕響，再休提天賓當年。」亦復稱洽可誦。</p>
<p>番禺沈太侔，各一學皆精，曾著有南雅一堂業書，繁和詞，詩一尤為南社健將，與余及凌霄，翰簡往來，疊至盈寸，其後沈歸道山，凌霄工於作聯而不為，余勉成一聯挽之云：「老去漫填詞，繅成白髮淸愁，一卷繁霜悲點鬢；醒來都是夢，浣盡靑衫潰淚，十年舊雨賦吞聲。」自花圈盛行，普通不用挽聯，寫作者亦就逐漸减少，將來此調恐終成廣陵散矣。</p>
<h3>「薄禮」</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>明末淸初，史可法旣殉難，淸兵直抵南京，城中文武大臣王鐸，錢謙益等出或跪迎，各獻重禮求降</p>
<p>據說錢謙益的這副禮最「薄」，禮單如下：「流金金銀器，法琅銀　各一具；蟠龍玉杯，宋製玉杯，天鹿犀杯，葵花犀杯，芙蓉犀杯，法琅鼎杯各一套；法琅鶴杯，銀鑲鶴杯各一對；宣德宮扇，眞金卅扇，弋陽金扇，戈奇金扇，百子宮扇，眞金杭扇各十柄；眞金蘇扇十柄，銀鑲象箸十雙。」</p>

<p>第十四章　逍遙海上</p>
<p>肖柏道：「可以的，可惜沒帶來，我可以把信裏大意吿訴你，她說自到上海後很受各方面歡迎，現在有一般人要選平劇皇后，大概這皇后寶座，十有八九是可操左券的，這是她一宗榮耀的事，其次是梅博士已經收她做徒弟，親行傳授本戲，並極力提携她，她認為前途極有希望，這是她一宗最安慰的事，還有一件最奇特的事，最近某最高要人，要召見她，和她談談藝術和生活，她對於這一點很注意，認為不可多得的機會，將來可以誇耀儕輩，這三宗事，在來信筆墨行間，都顯着很興會，很得意的。她現在所感苦惱的，有許多有錢老闆和她糾纏，還有許多不願意接近的人，為的塲面上，不得不接近，據她信上說，她每日由起床到上戲院，不斷有客來找她，每天要想在家安安靜靜，吃一頓飯，都沒工夫，總是被人家約出去茶舞，或是晚會，這種塲合都是有關係，不能得罪的，所以每天弄得精神非常疲勞，加之上海戲院，差不多名角都要演雙　戲，忙得她一天顛顛倒倒，不知天日，她信上並說，有見着你，勸你努力前程，她在上海，總算過得去，姑且逍遙一時，再作道理，你看人傢一個女孩子居然拿得起，放得下，她經了那樣嚴重打擊，還能重整旗鼓，在上海建立事業，你到現在還是精神不振，一切看不開，竟不如她了，以後你要撇開一切，振起精神努力向前途邁進，不要再為一個女友，記掛在心頭。」渚齋道：「我看她給我父親的信，也是很苦悶的，並不抱樂觀。」肖柏道：「你這傻小子，她寫給你父親的信，也照給我的信，直言無隱，在你父親看來，這人還有什麼價值呀，她能造成今日地位，未嘗不是你父親刺激成功的，她若把去上海得意情形，吿訴你父親，在父親看來，這種楊花水性的女子，幸而能先機而作，把她支使出去，不然這種人要去家裏，要成禍水，她訴說她苦悶，訴說她委曲，正是她聰明處，你不要給她騙過，人家在上海名利雙收，逍遙自在，你却一天愁眉苦臉，儘想着她，未免太痴太傻了，你們年輕的人都是感情作用，很容易走入迷途，你以後無論什麼事，都要加以理智判斷，便不至自苦。」一八</p>

<h3>雷荟</h3>
<p>晚　時，上海出了幾部　傳的小說：官塲現形記，老殘游記，孽海花。各於政治社會有部分的寫實，故不失為「傳作」。淸代之小說量號而質絕精，足以代表一時代之文學，紅樓夢沉博絕麗，壓倒一切；儒林外史，兒女英雄傳，蕩寇志及義俠公案諸作，亦有可觀。至於淸末仍有以上所述諸作，為之殿軍，亦斯道之光矣。</p>
<p>所謂「傳作」不止當時看號有興致，而須有永久的循覽尋味之價值；出版之後，不靠宣傳，多數認為隨時可看，而常置案頭，則為成功的作品。淸代百業不興，社會定型，政治與人民生活，時事得失，「切操持於官僚之手；官僚以科舉出身者為正途，大衆所傾慕者，亦惟做官與科舉。故如孽海花寫京朝官及翰林人物之情事，（孽海花作者曾君乃汪柳門之東牀。汪乙丑翰林，迭掌文衡，詞林老手，故其壻亦能說能道。書中仍有錯誤及外行語，前四年上海出版之某雜誌，曾列表摘出。然此等枝節之疵，不能掩沒其整個之價值。因能寫京朝宦，　苑風光之小說尚不多　。</p>
<p>科名時代讀書人一生與考試為錄，由童生而生員，由生員而賈生，舉人；由舉人而進士，因然無級不考。即成進士入翰林，號稱淸貴之班，出為主考學政，以考試他人矣；然共出差之前，亦必經過「考差。」又翰林大考，優者升，劣者降罰。故有詩曰：「金頂朝珠褂紫貂，羣仙衆日樂逍遙；一聞大考魂皆落，吿退神仙亦不饒。」寫「翰林怕大考」，與「秀才怕歲考」的心情，正復相同。孽海花所寫的考試，便是　一類　超乎科舉的考試</p>
<p>科名考試，鄉試會試最重要，寫得詳確者，推兒女英雄傳為第一。寫安公子秋闈，自入賀院以至出搒，報喜，一切情形，考官及舉子的心緒，旣周而細，活躍活現。占有千餘年舊文化史之主試塲，得此篇眞永留印象於人間，其歷史價、值，非任何所能比擬。（孽海花若有如此簽　，則其所寫翰林各項考試，必更有可觀。）此等傳眞價值，遠過於黨故筆記。因筆記只能紀事，不能傳神寫景，使讀者如身臨其境也。著者文康，係舉人出身，故所寫亦以舉塲為最眞切。因其人未中進士，未掌文衡，故如朝考殿試之次序，座號卷號之分別，均被　恂指誤。董老即請評此書之「　　我書室主人。」揚州人，道光庚子進士，仕至戶部尚書。同治戊辰，光緒丙子兩科會試總裁，及各項文差，故一切熟悉。）然即此鄉闈數段而言，已屬絕無僅有之成功作，其他書他人所寫不出的。會試塲中光景與鄉閘大致相同，故安老爺與安公子之會塲皆　略叙過即可。「老秀才」謂之「小考」，是讀書人第一步功名，學院主之。儒林外史及醒世因緣；今古奇觀均有寫到之處可備一格。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly's Seven Groups Hold Separate Meetings, 100 Proposals Reviewed and Completed, Intense Debate on Constitutional Amendments Reaches No Conclusion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Assembly did not hold a general meeting on the 16th. The announcement of the eight presidential candidates was posted in front of the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM, attracting a large crowd of citizens and representatives. On the 16th, the seven review committees held separate meetings to review the proposals. The progress of each group was very smooth. One hundred general proposals were all reviewed and completed. However, the First Review Committee, when reviewing the constitutional amendments, engaged in intense debate and reached no conclusion. The General Assembly is scheduled to hold its eleventh meeting on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The six proposals to amend the Constitution, after being passed for initial reading on the 15th and submitted for review, were discussed at the First Review Committee of the Assembly, namely the Constitution Review Group, which convened at 9:20 AM on the 16th. In addition to submitting the six proposals for discussion, a total of thirteen proposals related to the Constitution were also presented together. 297 members attended the review meeting, chaired by Zhang Zhiben. He first explained that the group's review of each case was divided into four parts: (1) those who advocated amending the Constitution; (2) those who advocated not amending the articles but proposing supplementary measures; (3) those who advocated not amending the Constitution; and (4) those who wanted to determine the term of the National Assembly. Whether to proceed with a categorized broad discussion was then met with some opposition, as some believed that Zhang Zhiben was one of the proposers and should not be the convener of the group, let alone the chairman, which caused some disturbance at the meeting. During the meeting, a total of 21 representatives spoke, dividing into two opposing opinions on amending or not amending. Speakers from both sides received considerable enthusiastic support. Those who opposed amending the Constitution included Su Naxin, Chen Duanben, Fang Mian, Cao Pingfan, Shi Xin San, and Jiang Shiyi. Those who advocated amending the Constitution included Liu Jiashu, Ma Xuchang, Ma Chengji, and Jiang Jianbai. In addition, Wang Chonghui and Pan Gongzhan also put forward new opinions. Wang Chonghui said: The question of constitutional amendment is not whether it can be amended, but whether we can amend it under the current situation. When the Constitution was drafted, it took great pains. Now, during the time of suppression of the rebellion, the time is short. Is it too hasty? Among the proposals advocating constitutional amendments, we believe that the method of convening the National Assembly regularly to amend the constitution is very good. It may be convened at another fixed time. Pan Gongzhan believes that the Constitution has some shortcomings that must be amended, but now the time is pressing. Should the review committee be solely responsible for it and continue its work after the meeting? Secondly, regarding the temporary provisions authorizing the president, he believes that it is a need of the actual situation. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>The First Group Reviews the Constitution, Proposers Speak Enthusiastically Both in the Morning and Afternoon</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:30 PM, with 296 attendees, chaired by Zhang Yingyi. First, the chairman reported that after the representatives spoke in the morning on the various cases related to the constitutional amendment, the opinions were divided into two parts: one advocating amendment and the other not agreeing to amendment. Now, 75 more people have requested to speak, and the constitutional proposals have been divided into four parts. In addition to the two parts of whether to amend or not, there are also: (1) adding temporary clauses to authorize the president to handle emergencies; (2) regularly convening a temporary National Assembly. It is hoped that the speeches in the afternoon will focus on these two points, and everyone will abide by the time so that a conclusion can be reached and submitted to the second reading meeting on the 17th. Secondly, among the 13 proposals, there are still some that have not been explained by the proposers. Lin Bin explained the main points of his proposal "Proposal for Regularly Convening a Temporary National Assembly". Then, Shi Shangkuan explained his proposal "Please this National Assembly formulate the implementation procedures of the Constitution to facilitate the implementation of the Constitution". Next, Zhou Lisheng explained the main points of his proposal "Intend to collect the opinions on amending the Constitution and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for constitutional implementation, or specially form a committee to sort out and study, and draft a bill to be submitted to this Temporary General Assembly for decision". He advocated amending the Constitution but did not agree to amend it immediately. Luo Wenmo explained his proposal "Please convene a temporary National Assembly within two years after the closing of this General Assembly, in accordance with the provisions of Article 30, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the Constitution, to amend the Constitution". Representative Pan Gongzhan's proposal was reissued on the 16th, "Please the General Assembly decide on the date of the second meeting of this National Assembly so that the representatives can continue to exercise their political power on behalf of the people". The method is to hold the opening ceremony of the first second meeting on December 25, 1950. If the suppression of the rebellion is completed earlier, it can be convened in advance. Pan explained that the reason why he specified December 25, 1950, is that the Constitution has been promulgated for four years, and the suppression of the rebellion should be completed in the next two years or so. If it is rigidly stipulated as "after the completion of the suppression of the rebellion", it would be inappropriate. What if we encounter foreign troubles after the suppression of the rebellion is completed? After the report, continue to speak in order. Dai Tianqiu and others still said that the preamble of the Constitution once stated that it was based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, but the content was not so. We should not restrict the law with facts and must make some remedies. Zhou Junshi shouted loudly that the principle of the constitutional amendment proposal had been passed at the first reading meeting on the 15th, and it should be voted on today without discussion. Zhou's speech caused another commotion at the meeting. Later, Zheng Xiuqing spoke, expressing sympathy for the proposal to authorize the president. Xie Chengping said: There is no need to argue too much about whether to amend the constitution or not. He said that he accepted Pan Gongzhan's proposal to convene a temporary National Assembly for constitutional amendment in two years. Zhou Lisheng's case can also be carefully studied. Everyone must unite and not act impulsively. Gu Zhenggang said that as a member of the Kuomintang, he also believes that the Constitution does not meet Sun Yat-sen's ideals and should be amended, but from the perspective of the actual situation, if we pay attention to ideals, we must also take into account ideals, which is impossible. The current task is to fully suppress the communist rebellion. It is suggested that Pan and Luo's cases be merged, and the temporary meeting be held on December 25, 1950. The temporary provisions are needed for the facts, and everyone will definitely agree. The constitutional amendments that have not been discussed will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to formulate amendments and submit them to the next temporary meeting for discussion. Gu's speech ended at 6:00 PM, and the meeting adjourned. No conclusion was reached today. Whether the agenda will be changed on the 17th will be discussed and decided by the General Assembly on the 17th.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Review Committee</h3>
<p>Passes Six Social Security Proposals</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Fifth Review Committee held meetings on the 16th, both in the morning and afternoon, to discuss six proposals related to social security. In the morning, Chairman Li Hongwen first conducted a preliminary study of each case. In the afternoon, Chairman Chen Jianxiu passed the review opinions on each case around 5:00 PM: (1) Yu Jichuan and others proposed that the government should clearly stipulate effective measures to relieve the poor in order to maintain people's livelihood. (2) Lan Wenbin and others proposed that all provinces and cities should earnestly carry out relief undertakings. The two cases were reviewed and passed after amendment. (3) Luo Dafan and others proposed that the government should reform the education policy to save learning time and accelerate education progress. The review opinion was amended and passed.

The review opinion was amended and passed. (6) Chen Jixian and others proposed that the government should quickly find ways to relieve the refugee women and protect the children in the pacification area in order to maintain the foundation of the country. The review opinion was passed.</p>
<h3>Presidium Meeting, Agreeing on the Agenda for Today's General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Assembly Presidium held a meeting on the evening of the 16th to discuss the agenda for the 17th. It was decided that the General Assembly would be held on the morning of the 17th. The second reading and third reading of the constitutional amendment were originally scheduled to be held on the 17th. Because the First Group's review of the constitutional amendment has not yet yielded results, the first reading and third approval meetings have been postponed to the morning and afternoon of the 18th. The date for the presidential election on the 19th remains unchanged. At the General Assembly on the morning of the 17th, the convener of the First Review Committee will report on the progress of the constitutional amendment review on the 16th, and solicit the opinions of the General Assembly on whether it needs to be submitted for review again. The General Assembly will vote. If the review continues, it will be held at noon on the 17th. Qin Dechun was appointed as the chairman of the General Assembly on the morning of the 17th. In addition, Kong Xianrong, a representative from Songjiang, committed suicide. The General Assembly will pay tribute on the morning of the 17th, and Mo Dehui will report on Kong's suicide.</p>

<h3>The Second Review Committee, Proposals Related to National Defense, Divided into Four Categories for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Second Review Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM on the 16th to review 32 proposals related to national defense. 180 members attended, with Xu Peigen as chairman. First, the review method was discussed. After a long time, it was decided that the convener would first classify the proposals according to their nature and then divide them into several groups for review. The meeting then adjourned. The people continued to meet and divided the proposals into four groups: (1) general reform of national defense and military affairs, (2) strengthening the military structure for suppressing the rebellion, (3) strengthening border defense, and (4) people's self-defense and suppression of the rebellion. When the meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the four groups were sent for preliminary review.</p>
<p>The General Reform of National Defense and Military Affairs Group reviewed seven proposals, the most important of which were Huo Tianyi and others' proposal to investigate Liang Huasheng for dereliction of duty during the withdrawal from Jilin, and He Foqing and others' proposal to severely punish Chief of Staff Chen Cheng. The members argued for a long time. Finally, it was decided that the review opinion was that the former should be sent to the government for investigation, and the latter should be sent to the government for reference. The other cases were sent to the government for reference, attention, or handling.</p>
<p>The Strengthening the Military Structure for Suppressing the Rebellion Group reviewed five proposals. The main content of each case was to strengthen the structure, jurisdiction, and powers of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters. After reviewing the four cases together, it was decided to put forward four points in the review opinion: (1) urge the government to decree that the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters is the highest military and political command organization in North China, and the Beiping Executive Headquarters should be abolished; (2) the jurisdiction should include the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin; (3) Fu Zuoyi should be responsible for organizing and training 30 new divisions, actively equipping them, and completing 10 divisions within six months; (4) when the number of soldiers in the jurisdiction is insufficient, the Ministry of National Defense should allocate and replenish them. In addition, specific opinions were also put forward on unifying and expanding the powers of the general bandit suppression command organization.</p>
<p>The Strengthening Border Defense Group reviewed six proposals, which were merged into four cases for review.

<p>The People's Self-Defense and Suppression of the Rebellion Group reviewed ten proposals, which were merged for review. The specific opinions were: (1) awaken the people to strengthen the methods of suppressing the rebellion, and ask the government to consider and implement them; (2) strengthen the military force among the people in the border areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan, and ask the government to coordinate the handling; (3) step up general mobilization and improve the methods of local self-defense organizations, and transfer them to the government for reference.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Review Committee</h3>
<p>Advocates Establishing Schools for the Descendants of Martyrs</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Sixth Review Committee convened at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 16th. 195 members attended, chaired by Mei Yiqi. The nine educational and cultural proposals scheduled were all reviewed. All members were from the educational and cultural circles, and the review went very smoothly. Among them, the proposal to establish schools for the descendants of martyrs submitted by Yu Bin and others and the proposal on the proportion of educational funds in the budget submitted by Wang Yizhou and others were discussed most enthusiastically. Yu Bin did not attend due to business, and Mao Yanwen explained on his behalf. Fu Baochang's proposal to establish a school for the descendants of rebels in North China was also included in Yu's case for review. The review opinions for each case are as follows: (1) Shui Zi and others proposed that, in accordance with the Constitution, the national treasury should subsidize the educational and cultural funds of remote provinces in order to achieve balanced development. It is proposed to pass it. (2) Da Fan and others proposed to suggest that the government reform the education policy to save learning time and accelerate education progress. (3) Wang Jian Du and others proposed to set up public-funded degrees. Li Huan and others proposed to set up a Shao Li Chuandong University or industrial and commercial vocational school at the old site of the Sichuan Wanxian Tuokou Arsenal for further education and macro education. For the above three cases, it is proposed to retain them. (5) An and others proposed to actively promote blind and deaf education, determine the special party for the blind and deaf, quickly determine the implementation plan, and formulate laws to protect their welfare. It is proposed to pass it in principle. (6) Wang Yizhou and others, it is proposed that the National Government, starting from this year, should strictly compile and list the proportion of educational funds stipulated in the Constitution, and allocate a large amount of basic education expenses from them in order to implement basic education extensively and consolidate the foundation of constitutional government. It is proposed to send it to the government for earnest handling.

(9) Fu Baochang and others proposed: Please the government establish schools for the descendants of rebels in North China, prepare to establish a Northeast United University, and establish border schools. The first part is incorporated into Yu Bin's proposal, and the rest is proposed to be passed.</p>
<h3>Suggest the Government Earnestly Protect Rights and Urge the Soviet Union to Fulfill the Treaty. The Third Review Committee Amends Diplomatic Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Third Review Committee continuously convened in the morning and afternoon of the 16th to review diplomatic proposals. The meeting was hosted by Convener Mo Dehui at 9:30 AM. More than 30 members attended. First, they studied and reviewed the proposal submitted by Wu Huanzhang and others, "Please, in the name of the General Assembly, formally inform the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance within a time limit in order to show international credibility. If a satisfactory result is not obtained by the deadline, our country should immediately, based on the independent and autonomous position, solemnly declare the abolition of the Yalta Secret Agreement and the Sino-Soviet Treaty created by the errors of the agreement." Representatives Cheng Bingzhang, Hu Jingan, Qian Tianren, Chen Benduan, Liao Chongzhen, Huang Tingying, Zhang Guochen, Wang Keda, Huyan Pili, Zhou Gengsheng, Lei Zhen, Mo Dehui, Zhou Qianchong, Wang Shuren, etc., spoke enthusiastically, discussing the legal principles and facts in detail. All agreed that the measures listed in the original proposal to abolish the treaty were unilateral acts and difficult to supplement in practice. However, the National Assembly should express public opinion on this matter. Finally, according to the opinions of Lei Zhen and Mo Dehui, the measures of the case were amended to: "(1) the construction government urges the Soviet Union to thoroughly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty and return all the materials and machinery transported out of the country during the Soviet military's stationing in Northeast China; (2) if the Soviet Union delays in fulfilling it, our government should consider the situation and submit it to the United Nations organization and take all effective measures when necessary to safeguard our country's territorial sovereignty." Resolution: It is proposed to pass it and send it to the government for earnest handling. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>Please the Government to Consider Initiating the Southeast Asian Anti-Communist Agreement</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 4:00 PM, chaired by Zhou Gengsheng, to review the proposal submitted by Cao Tingguang and others, "Please the government initiate the organization of the Southeast Asian Security Military Alliance to safeguard democracy and peace in Southeast Asia." After the proposer Cao Tingguang briefly explained, Qian Tianren, Wang Keda, Chen Boji, Yu Bin, Hu Jingan, Lei Zhen, etc., spoke successively. All believed that the content of the explanation in this case was largely inconsistent with our country's current policies, and the measures taken were even more difficult to implement due to the facts. Wang Keda especially emphasized the trend of the overall situation at home and abroad, opposed the biased spirit of this case, and advocated retaining it. Finally, after Zhou Gengsheng, Lei Zhen, and the proposer studied and responded, it was proposed to amend the measures of the case and send them directly to the government for reference by the Presidium. This was agreed by the majority of the attending representatives, and the measures were amended to: "(1) our country's government should consider the situation and initiate the conclusion of the Southeast Asian regional agreement, inviting India, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, and other countries to participate. Australia and New Zealand can also join. (2) The countries participating in the agreement should jointly prevent the intrusion of communist forces and seek to increase economic cooperation. (3) For the purpose of discussing and concluding the above agreement and issues concerning the security order in the Southeast Asian region, our country's government shall convene a meeting of the above-mentioned countries when necessary." At this point, the only two proposals of the diplomatic group have been carefully studied and prudently handled, and the meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Group Reviews Economic Proposals, Advocates Requisitioning the Assets of the Wealthy, Implementing Land Reform to Clear the Source of Chaos</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Fourth Group Review Committee convened at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 16th. More than 100 members attended, chaired by Weng Wenhao. A total of 36 proposals from the National Economic Group were reviewed. First, the convener divided them into five categories: (1) finance, banking, and currency system, (2) land, agriculture, and land reclamation, (3) food, (4) transportation, (5) economic policy. After the representatives agreed, the review began. In the morning, nine proposals related to finance, banking, and the currency system were passed. Among them, He Foqing and others proposed to requisition the funds of the wealthy stored in the United States to stabilize the financial situation and benefit the suppression of the rebellion. Weng Cheng and others proposed to formulate laws, investigate the capital of the wealthy, collect special donations, and allocate them to a fund for relieving refugees. Long Wen and others proposed to suggest borrowing deposits from the wealthy to provide for national use to reduce the burden on the people and curb the source of chaos. After submitting for joint discussion, Pei Mingyu, Huang Zhan, He Foqing, Ni Zhichao, and others spoke successively, all criticizing the capital of the wealthy and advocating that laws should be formulated to requisition the capital of the wealthy and the assets stored in the United States by Chinese people. After that, the three cases were merged. It is proposed that the General Assembly should consult the government to formulate measures for requisitioning the assets of the wealthy and earnestly handle them within three months. Regarding the three proposals for reforming the currency system, the review opinion is that it is proposed to pass them in principle and hand them over to the government to organize a research association on currency system reform to study methods and implement them quickly. The review continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Xu Jiguang. All 36 proposals have been reviewed and completed. In the afternoon, the discussion on proposals related to land reform was the most enthusiastic. There are a total of three cases: (1) Liu Gui and others proposed to implement land-to-the-tiller within a time limit and immediately impose a progressive property tax. (2) Jiao Yitang and others proposed to suggest that all land in the country be nationalized, and land be distributed according to the number of people to eliminate the source of chaos and benefit the suppression of the rebellion. (3) Zhu Ping and others proposed to suggest that the government quickly and comprehensively implement land reform to clear the source of chaos and lay the foundation for the country. During the discussion, Liu Gui, Zhu Ping, and others stood up and explained that the main reason why the communist bandits are able to cause trouble is that the government has failed to implement the land-to-the-tiller policy in Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. Zhu Ping shouted loudly that without implementing the land policy, the suppression of the rebellion will not be completed. After merging for discussion, Liu Gui and Zhu Ping's cases were passed according to the original cases and sent to the government for earnest handling. The method is that the landlord's land should belong to the tillers, and the tillers should pay rent in installments within the next five years to obtain land ownership. Jiao Yitang's case was retained. Pan Gongzhan and others proposed that the National Government should issue an order to exempt food sales tax to maintain people's food and relieve the people's difficulties, which was also passed in principle and sent to the relevant government agencies for adoption and handling.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Signing Representatives Still Has No Solution</h3>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Advocates Constitutional Amendment, But Emphasizes Careful Deliberation and Scrutiny; Excessive Power of the Legislative Yuan is a Shortcoming of the Current Constitution</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Mr. Pan Gongzhan, a National Assembly representative from the Shanghai district, responded to reporters' inquiries on the 16th regarding the constitutional amendment issue, stating:</p>
<p>(1) Constitutionalism in any country is a process of growth, and the constitution is also a product of evolution. While the constitution is not an ordinary law, it is certainly not immutable. Moreover, the amendment of the constitution in our country is originally a power exercised by the National Assembly according to law, and no one within or outside the Assembly can restrict or deprive it. However, the constitution is, after all, the fundamental law, and the National Assembly must act with utmost caution when amending it. Recalling the constitutional drafting process the year before last, it seemed to have been done in haste, with mutual compromises and forced agreements, inevitably resulting in shortcomings that are now felt and regretted by all parties. If this National Assembly, again in haste, focuses on the deliberation and revision of clauses and sentences and makes resolutions immediately, there is a risk of repeating past mistakes. It would be best to conduct a longer period of review and discussion, and not make hasty decisions. In my opinion, the current session of the Assembly should authorize the Constitutional Review Committee to conduct a long-term and detailed review of the points that were not resolved in this session, after the first meeting is convened, and submit a detailed report for a solemn revision at the second meeting of the current National Assembly, in order to demonstrate the solemnity of the constitution.</p>
<p>(2) In my humble opinion, the current constitution has at least two major shortcomings: (1) The powers of the National Assembly are actively restricted, while the powers of the Legislative Yuan are expanded infinitely. Under this system, the power of the Legislative Yuan cannot be checked and balanced by any other body, greatly undermining the original intention of the separation of powers. Of course, the legislators are also popularly elected, but the Legislative Yuan has only one chamber, unlike the parliaments of other countries that have upper and lower houses or senates and houses of representatives. We must give the National Assembly the power to initiate and veto central laws, so that the Legislative Yuan will not act arbitrarily and unilaterally. (Parliaments in other countries have upper and lower houses that can check each other, and there is also a check and balance between the parliament and the cabinet through votes of no confidence in the government and dissolution of parliament, which are absent in our current constitution. This creates a constitution where the Legislative Yuan has unilateral power.) (2) The President is originally the head of state, commanding the army, navy, and air force, but given the current situation in China, especially during the period of mobilization for the suppression of rebellion, if we follow the current constitution, the President will have no power and no real authority to accomplish the mission of suppressing the rebellion. Even the executive branch will not have the power to take expedient measures in response to the situation. If we do not seek remedies and revisions, the government after the implementation of the constitution will inevitably be a government without power, that is, an incompetent government.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, I support and second both the amendment proposed by Representative Zhang Zhiben and the proposal for the enactment of temporary provisions by Representative Mo Dehui. Whether it is to enact temporary provisions or amend the constitution, it is necessary to study, remedy, and correct this constitution. This is a necessary step to adapt to the national conditions and cope with the overall situation.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, in my opinion, since the constitutional amendment proposals submitted by the representatives have been placed on the agenda and have passed the first reading, they should be reviewed and then subjected to the second and third readings, according to procedure. Whether supporting or opposing, all should have the right to speak and discuss fully, and then put to a vote according to law. Obstructing others from speaking or refusing to obey the vote is not in the spirit of democracy. However, in other countries' parliaments, the procedure of three readings for each major bill is sometimes not completed in the same meeting. Therefore, if the proposals submitted for review at this session are delayed due to time constraints, and the review report is submitted when the next session is convened, and then submitted for the second or third reading, there is nothing legally wrong with that, and it is worthy of consideration by colleagues in the Assembly.</p>
<h3>Urge the Government to Develop the Border Regions; The Seventh Review Committee Completes its Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The Seventh Review Committee convened a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 16th to review proposals related to the border regions. 167 representatives attended, chaired by Bai Chongxi. Leng Huiran and others proposed a "motion urging the government to promptly handle the affairs of the southwestern ethnic minorities to prevent border troubles." The wording of the motion was initially opposed by border representative Fu Zhengda, who stated that the ethnic minorities absolutely do not want to be enemies with the Han Chinese, but the government's use of force to suppress them only increases hatred. Luo Jialun then stated that past issues should not be investigated, and the motion was shelved. Wu Tiekul from Xinjiang and Zhakisqin from Mongolia both emphasized that border issues are ethnic issues, and Zhakisqin further argued that solving the problem of livelihood is the fundamental solution to all problems. Lin Jing believed that to solve the issue of ethnic minorities, the central government and the authorities of Sichuan, Kangding, and Yunnan provinces must hold a joint border affairs meeting to first determine the policy. He proposed revising the wording of the motion to "urge the government to promptly handle the affairs of the southwestern ethnic minorities, enhance unity, and strengthen national defense." The emotionally charged words and the entire explanation in the text were deleted, and the resolution was to request the government to implement it earnestly. The committee then discussed the proposal by Luo Zhezhen and others to "request that the rights and interests of border residents to participate in politics be stipulated by law." Item A of the proposal, which concerned participation in political institutions, was transferred to the first group, the constitutional group, because it involved constitutional provisions. Item B, which concerned participation in administrative institutions, proposed suggesting that the government make every effort to cultivate and employ talented border residents, and that the methods should be determined separately according to the different circumstances in each region. Finally, the committee reviewed the proposal by Yin Mingde and others to "request the government to quickly complete the construction of the Kunluo Highway (from Kunming southwest through Wangxi, Ning'er, Simao, Cheli to Daluo on the Yunnan-Burma border) and the Baomi Highway (from Baoshan to Myitkyina) in the southwestern border region, in order to develop the border region, build national defense, and develop international trade, and request a public decision." The review opinion was passed, and it was recommended that the government allocate funds as soon as possible and order the competent authorities to quickly repair and consolidate the two highways. The meeting adjourned at noon, and the review work of the border region group's proposals was completed.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Two Proposals Regarding Constitutional Amendment</h3>
<p>After the National Assembly held the first reading of the constitutional amendment proposals, it submitted the proposals to the constitutional group for review yesterday, which sparked a heated debate between representatives who advocated for and opposed the constitutional amendment. It seems that the constitution is bound to be amended; however, we always feel that the constitutional amendment should be discussed at length and treated with special caution. This newspaper's editorial has already expressed a clear view on the constitutional amendment issue. We believe that, from a legal perspective: according to Article 27 of the Constitution, amending the Constitution is one of the powers of the current National Assembly; furthermore, according to Article 174 of the Constitution, as long as the current National Assembly proceeds in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Constitution, that is, upon the proposal of one-fifth of the total number of representatives of the National Assembly, the attendance of one-half, and the resolution of three-fourths of the representatives present, there is absolutely no problem in amending the Constitution. The representatives of the opposition party have no legal justification whatsoever. However, in fact, if the current National Assembly intends to amend the Constitution, it will inevitably cause new political disputes.</p>
<p>When the constitutional group reviewed the proposals yesterday, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and a part of the non-partisan representatives all firmly expressed their opposition to the current National Assembly amending the Constitution. The various reasons they held can be summarized as follows: (1) The Constitution is the fundamental law of the country and should have stability. The Constitution has not yet been implemented, and to amend it immediately seems to contradict the principle of rigidity adopted by our Constitution; (2) No legal or political system is absolutely superior or inferior. Our Constitution has not yet been implemented, so there are no facts that can prove that it is necessary to amend it; (3) When the last National Assembly discussed the draft Constitution, it took a great deal of effort to get the National Assembly to abandon the Five-Five Constitution and adopt a Constitution drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Therefore, our Constitution can be said to be the result of agreements between various political parties. The political environment a month ago was the same as it was the year before last, so it should not be amended; (4) In the current National Assembly, the Kuomintang still occupies an absolute majority and exceeds the total number of representatives of the Democratic Youth Party and non-partisan parties. The Kuomintang should especially respect the opinions of the minority parties. In all fairness, the representatives of the Democratic Youth Party have quite sufficient reasons for opposing the current National Assembly amending the Constitution, but the representatives of the Democratic Youth Party have neglected another factual need that makes it necessary to amend the current Constitution.</p>
<p>Article 43 of the Constitution stipulates: "When the State is confronted with natural calamities, epidemics, or major financial or economic changes requiring urgent measures, the President... may, in accordance with the Emergency Orders Act, issue emergency orders and take necessary measures." However, it does not include the Communist rebellion. If this article of the Constitution is not amended, then the new government that is produced in accordance with the Constitution will either "abandon the suppression of rebellion for the sake of the Constitution" or "violate the Constitution for the sake of the war." Neither of these possible outcomes is what our people want. Because in the former case, democratic constitutionalism will inevitably perish with the demise of the country and the nation; in the latter case, democratic constitutionalism will have a matter of constitutional non-compliance at the beginning, which is definitely not a blessing for our country's democracy. Therefore, in order to "suppress the rebellion on the one hand and implement the Constitution on the other," the proposal for the enactment of temporary provisions for the period of mobilization for the suppression of rebellion, submitted by non-partisan representative Mo Dehui and 1,201 other representatives, is of great significance.</p>
<p>The greatest feature of this proposal is that it does not require amending the Constitution, but only adding a temporary provision that will immediately expire after the successful suppression of the rebellion. This will not only make the government capable, but also enable the government that implements the Constitution to suppress the rebellion, taking both sides into account, which is the most appropriate legislative policy. As the constitutional authority Wang Shijie said: "We want a constitutional government that can suppress the rebellion, and a government that suppresses the rebellion can implement the Constitution." At the same time, if we review the political history of the United States, during the First World War, the United States Congress granted special powers to President Wilson; during the Second World War, the United States Congress also granted special powers to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, which is an excellent precedent. It is this point that enables the democratic system to adapt to extraordinary events. We believe that the representatives of the Democratic Youth Party, under the major premise of supporting the government in suppressing the rebellion and building the country, will definitely not stubbornly adhere to their own opinions, regard the constitutional articles as golden rules, sacred and inviolable, and oppose any necessary amendments; they will also hope that the National Assembly can seriously review and pass Mo's proposal.</p>
<p>Article 27 of the Constitution stipulates the powers of the National Assembly: (1) to elect the President and Vice President; (2) to recall the President and Vice President; (3) to amend the Constitution; (4) to ratify constitutional amendments proposed by the Legislative Yuan. According to this, the powers of the current National Assembly are only two: (1) to elect the President and Vice President; (2) to amend the Constitution; and amending the Constitution is, in fact, not without difficulties; therefore, the task of the current National Assembly is limited to electing the President and Vice President. However, three thousand national representatives gather in the capital to hold a meeting, only to be allowed to vote to elect the President and Vice President, and not to allow the people's representatives to inquire about national affairs. In economic terms, this is a waste of money and manpower; in terms of reason and emotion, it is also unworkable. Therefore, the National Assembly representatives unanimously requested a review of national affairs; from a legal perspective, this is unavoidable to be suspected of overstepping the boundaries; but in the autumn of national hardship, how can the National Assembly representatives be taught to remain silent? Therefore, the proposal to amend the powers of the National Assembly submitted by Zhang Zhiben and 871 other representatives is also worthy of our attention. Zhang proposed adding two powers to the National Assembly: (1) to initiate legislative principles; (2) to ratify laws related to the rights and obligations of the people. But from our point of view, Zhang's constitutional amendment should be reconsidered. Since the National Assembly is an institution representing the national administrative power, its powers should be limited to the four civil rights. To amend Article 27, it is only necessary to change "but" to "Regarding the two rights of initiative and referendum, the National Assembly shall formulate methods and exercise them." This would include everything.</p>
<p>In short, we originally did not advocate amending the Constitution, not because the current Constitution is perfect and does not need to be amended, but because, in the current political environment, we should avoid causing new political disputes; even if there are places that must be amended in fact, we should discuss them at length and take all aspects into consideration. If we can do this, we will definitely be able to gain the understanding of the opposition party. May the National Assembly representatives act with caution!</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan and Chen Xunyu Propose</h3>
<p>To Establish a National Newspaper Organization</p>
<p>Hosted National Assembly Representatives from the Press in Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, and Chen Xunyu, the general manager, hosted a reception at the Liuhua Chun restaurant at 5 p.m. on the 16th for the National Assembly representatives engaged in journalism.

He is willing to work with colleagues in the industry, and Shenbao also hopes to provide more support. General Manager Chen then immediately proposed that journalists and the newspaper industry still lack a national organization. Today's newspaper industry, like general industry and commerce, is affected by social poverty and faces a crisis. There are also many restrictions on speech and reporting due to the current situation. However, there is no one to speak for those who speak for others. It is urgently hoped that colleagues in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places will quickly work together to establish a national guild and strive for their own rights and interests through the elected representatives of journalism. The words of the two men were warmly applauded and approved by those present at the banquet. Representative Liu Weifeng declared on behalf of colleagues in Central China: He will wholeheartedly support the establishment of a national journalists' guild and a newspaper guild. The participants clinked glasses and toasted, and the reception ended happily at 9 p.m.</p>
<h3>Public Decree by the National Government Praising Kong Xianrong</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Sends Wu Siyu as His Representative to Offer Sacrifices</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The National Government issued an order on the 16th: National Assembly Representative Kong Xianrong, of upright character, loved his country and his hometown. During the War of Resistance, he initiated and led local militias in guerrilla warfare in the Changbai Mountains, making meritorious contributions. After the victory, he reorganized his troops and served in military posts in the border area, defending the locality with unwavering dedication. Sadly, due to the ongoing difficulties of the time, he passed away from depression during his attendance at the National Assembly, a cause for deep sorrow. He should be publicly praised to commend his loyalty and righteousness.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] When Chairman Chiang met with Mo Dehui on the evening of the 15th, he was deeply saddened to learn of the suicide of Kong Xianrong, a National Assembly representative from Songjiang Province. On the morning of the 16th, when Yu Bin paid his respects, the Chairman conveyed his sentiments and informed him that special personnel had been assigned to handle Kong's funeral arrangements, bereavement compensation, and posthumous commendation. Kong's remains have been moved to the China Funeral Home. The coffin was sealed at 2:00 PM on the 16th, and all the National Assembly representatives attended the ceremony. Representatives from the Northeast region began arriving early in the morning to express their condolences. An emergency meeting was convened at 10:00 AM to discuss the arrangements following Kong's death, attended by Yu Bin and 200 others, with Bi Zezi presiding. The meeting reported Kong's deeds and the circumstances of his suicide. The presidium of the assembly decided on the following measures: (1) To immediately send a telegram of condolence to Kong's family in the name of the Northeast Representatives' Friendship Association, and to send a telegram of condolence to Kong's subordinates, encouraging them to continue their efforts in suppressing the rebellion. (2) To appoint special personnel to draft a eulogy of Kong Xianrong for announcement both domestically and abroad. (3) To appoint special personnel to draft a temporary motion for the unanimous endorsement of all Northeast representatives, to be presented to the assembly on the 17th. During the Northeast representatives' meeting, they discussed the reasons for Kong's suicide at length, concluding that under the policy of building local military forces, Kong's suicide was actually due to personnel issues. Some representatives even vehemently criticized the Zhao family for obstructing Kong's efforts to suppress the rebellion and bandits. When Kong's remains were sealed in the coffin at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Chairman Chiang specially sent Wu Siyu, Director of the Ceremonial Bureau, as his representative to offer sacrifices and express condolences to Kong's family. For a time, half of the National Assembly representatives gathered for a collective memorial service, with Mo Dehui presiding, and Bai Chongxi and Liu Zhe as accompanying officials. Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Yu Bin, Hu Shi, and others also attended.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] It is reported that Kong Xianrong's only relatives in Nanjing are his nephew and niece-in-law. His nephew, Jian Geng, was originally in prison, but the relevant authorities have agreed to temporarily release him so that he can handle Kong's funeral arrangements. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang deeply mourned Kong's death and presented a eulogy with the four characters "Undying Loyalty."</p>

<h3>Garrison Troops Along the Longhai Railway Cut Back on Food to Help Disaster-Stricken Compatriots</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] Garrison troops stationed along the Longhai Railway in northern Jiangsu, witnessing the plight of the numerous refugees gathered there, crying out for food and facing dire conditions, have voluntarily cut back on their food rations and collected over 20 million yuan to assist the disaster-stricken people.</p>
<h3>No High Peaks in Mount Ji Shi, Guo Qingshan Nearby Reaches 21,000 Feet, Central Aviation Special Plane Returned Safely to Lanzhou After Yesterday's Exploration</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 16th] The Central Aviation exploration plane of Mount Ji Shi did not take off on the 16th due to widespread haze. When the weather improved at noon, the C-46 XT-0508 aircraft, carrying reporters and others, a total of nineteen people, who had been waiting at the airport for half a day, soared into the sky at 12:55 PM. The flight was still personally piloted by Chen Wenkuan, Deputy Manager of Central Aviation. At 5:15 PM, the Central Aviation radio station here received a message from the plane, stating briefly: Mount Ji Shi is not as high as expected. The message described the route as follows: Flying west from Lanzhou along the Yellow River, the plane ascended to an altitude of 18,000 feet, but no peaks exceeding 21,000 feet were seen. If there were any, they must have been obscured by clouds. However, it can be concluded that there are no high peaks in the Maqing Mountain Range. The plane then flew to and circled Lake Senoer at 101 degrees East longitude and 33 degrees North latitude for fifteen minutes before turning back.

<h3>Eastern Taiwan Has Abundant Mineral Resources, Hoping the Government Will Expedite Development</h3>
<p>Taiwan Provincial Assembly Speaker Discusses His Inspection Tour</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Taipei, 16th] Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, recently returned from an inspection tour of eastern Taiwan. He told reporters this afternoon that although eastern Taiwan is infertile and its people are poor, it is of particular value in terms of national defense. He emphasized that the central government should pay special attention to studying and developing it. At present, eastern Taiwan is facing serious flooding and transportation is blocked, so it is urgently necessary to repair dikes and build roads. The region is rich in gold, silver, timber, and mineral resources, and its fishery production is very high, so investments should be made to develop these resources. He advocated that the government should encourage immigration to eastern Taiwan and quickly restore water conservancy and transportation, otherwise, in a few years, eastern Taiwan will become a sandy beach, not only losing a national defense fortress, but also causing the current hundreds of thousands of residents to have no means of survival. Huang will invite the heads of relevant departments and offices of the provincial government in the next few days to discuss this issue.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Chronicle Two Major Camps: Amending the Constitution vs. Protecting the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Protecting the Constitution and amending the Constitution were originally two aspects of the same thing, but in the National Assembly hall, where politics and law are confused, the two have clearly become two opposing camps. Those who advocate amending the Constitution hope to fill in some loopholes in the Constitution and make it a perfect Constitution. This cannot be said to be protecting the Constitution, and naturally this is from a legal point of view. Those who advocate not amending the Constitution are afraid that the Constitution will be hastily amended in a hurry, which will damage the dignity of the Constitution and hinder the overall spirit of the Constitution. This is protecting the Constitution, but this should be said to be of a political nature, because this fundamental law is the result of party consultations. According to the law, it needs to be amended. In theory, Kuomintang representatives also want to amend it, but some people oppose amending it, which is political.</p>
<p>The Constitution Review Committee held a meeting all day long. There were few speakers, and more people wanted to speak. However, in the end, no one jumped out of these two major camps. Although the chairman of the afternoon's session, Zhang Qishu, repeatedly reminded everyone to first discuss the temporary provisions authorizing the President and the term of the temporary National Assembly, it was still ineffective. In the morning, the most vocal opponent of amending the Constitution, and the most methodical speaker, was Cheng Wenxi. He said, "In the past, I opposed it, now I oppose it, and in the future, I will still oppose it." This kind of strong and affirmative sentence caused some resentment. Although it was only a few words, it caused an uproar in the venue. After he calmed down, he said: The reasons for opposing the amendment of the Constitution are, first, we respect Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings; second, the Constitution has already determined Chairman Chiang's position; third, the spirit of the constitutions of European and American countries has already been included. Secondly, he pointed out that the most powerful public opinion at present also does not advocate amending the Constitution. For example, Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang, does not advocate amending the Constitution, because the current task is to suppress the rebellion. The Min[she] and Qing[nian] parties have also issued statements before and after, not advocating amending the Constitution. Moreover, this Constitution is a good medicine for saving China, and it is to lead China on the road to democracy, and it has been well received internationally, so it is not advocated to amend it. Zhou Lisheng criticized this Constitution, saying that there are too many loopholes. Not only is the National Assembly part, but also the government part, saying that three powers are not three powers, saying that five powers are not five powers. The cabinet system is not like it, and the presidential system is not like it either. On the contrary, the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan have taken away the power of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Those who advocate protecting the Constitution and not amending it mostly bring up the dignity of the Constitution, which seems to be unbreakable and cannot be easily shaken. Most of these people belong to the Kuomintang's friendly parties, that is, the Min[zhu Shehui] Party and the Youth Party. Their biggest motivation for disagreeing with the amendment of the Constitution is that the formulation of this Constitution was the result of very hard consultations among the three parties. If it is suddenly amended today, it is said that their original opinions and spirit in participating in the Constitution will lose their vitality, so no matter from which angle they say it, they do not agree to amend it. Although this Constitution does not meet their ideal, they would rather keep it unchanged.</p>
<p>Most of those who advocate amending the Constitution are members of the Kuomintang, because in the history of constitution-making, they did not start from the National Assembly for Constitution-Making, which opened in November of the 35th year of the Republic. They have a long history and a traditional and consistent spirit. They are not willing to destroy the original consistent spirit.</p>
<p>However, what we see in the venue today is a real battle. In fact, a powerful undercurrent is lurking. What is this? It is politics, politics, politics. Chairman Chiang is thinking about the future of the country and the people, abandoning all prejudices, and repeatedly advising Kuomintang members to cooperate sincerely with friendly parties under the major premise, and not to amend the Constitution. However, when some members believe that it is necessary to amend it from a legal point of view, they will inevitably break through this powerful undercurrent and manifest it on the surface. This is the open and secret struggle in the venue all day today. As the saying goes, Minister Gu Zhenggang said well, we (referring to the Kuomintang and the Min[zhu Qingnian] parties) have stood on the anti-communist front and are working together to complete the suppression of the bandits. Yes, we have to admit that everyone has not forgotten or abandoned the real enemy.</p>
<p>In today's venue, we were given a scene of political disputes from the beginning, although that was only a very small beginning. Originally, the chairman and convener today was Zhang Zhiben, but the voices of opposition were very loud, and the order of the venue was completely disrupted for a time. The leaders of the three parties present at the time immediately conducted consultations, and then Chen Bulei explained to the Kuomintang members, Yu Jia[ju] warned the Qingnian Party members, and Xu Fulin persuaded the Min[zhu Shehui] Party members, unanimously explaining that there was no need to act emotionally and turn small things into big things. This scene of sharp angularization was actually able to calm down from the noisy venue immediately, and continue to elect Chairman Zhang Zhiben, calmly and without incident. A strong atmosphere of fire and a strong political atmosphere unfolded in the venue, but "suppressing the communists is our biggest task at present" is a consensus reached by the three parties.

<h3>Philippine President Roxas Dies of Illness Sudden Death from a Heart Attack, Still Criticizing Communism Before His Death Vice President Quirino Will Be Promoted to President</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 16th] Philippine President Roxas died suddenly last night of a heart attack at Clark Air Base, a US Air Force base fifty miles northwest of Manila, at the age of 56. Before his sudden death, he delivered a fierce speech criticizing communism. The heart attack occurred at 2:30 PM and he died at 10:10 PM despite treatment. The President's Office announced the death this morning, and the body is being transported back to Manila by special car. Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino, 52 years old, will be promoted to President according to law. Mr. Quirino is currently on a boat vacation in the central Philippines and received the wireless report of the President's death near Cebu. After Roxas's illness, American military doctors, together with the famous Philippine doctor Ferrerimas, used oxygen to try to rescue him. The President's personal physician Xue Song also rushed from Manila by plane. The President's wife and mother also rushed to the airport. The President died in the dormitory of the Commander of the Thirteenth Air Force of the United States, Oponk, with his family by his side. Although Roxas's death was unexpected, he had been suffering from heart disease for many years. When he was Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Japanese occupation, he feigned illness to avoid various unpleasant tasks. Last year, he was shot at in a public speech and escaped unscathed. One person died in his place and six people were injured. He fell ill during the campaign movement in November, and rested for a long time. Last night on the third star, Mr. Roxas celebrated the birthday of American Ambassador O'Neill and his own 27th wedding anniversary at the Presidential Palace until after midnight. This morning, Mr. Roxas took the train to Clark Air Base to review the US Air Force's maneuvers and gave a speech to 500 US military officers and Philippine dignitaries, and the audience cheered like thunder. His warning was, "The nations of the world that love freedom do not want war, but when the situation deteriorates to the extreme, they will have to fight to defend freedom." A few minutes after the speech, the old disease recurred, and the scheduled infantry review program was temporarily canceled.</p>

Mrs. Roxas was inconsolable and was helped off the car by Senate Speaker Avellino and supported into the car by her beloved daughter Lupe. At that time, the crowd was crowded near the station, and the police and the President's guards prevented the audience from approaching the moon. The body was carried into the ambulance by the guards, and the military band played elegies and the national anthem. Mrs. Roxas stepped forward, lifted the national flag and kissed her husband's forehead. The honor guard then began to march slowly towards Malacañang Presidential Palace.</p>

<p>A Brief History of Roxas</p>
<p>Philippine President Roxas was an American-style figure, born in 1892 in Capiz, the capital of Panay Island in the central Philippines. His father was executed for participating in the anti-Spanish revolution, a family tragedy he experienced in his childhood.</p>
<p>From 1900, the United States began to spread American education in the Philippines, and Roxas was among the first generation to receive such education. He initially studied at a public school in his town, then entered Manila High School, and in 1917 entered the University of the Philippines, majoring in law. Roxas excelled in school, and with the guidance and encouragement of his teachers, he was inspired to become a leader of the people. Under the influence of his American teachers, he not only learned academically but also gained American democratic ideals.</p>
<p>From 1913 to 1917, he worked in the Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines. In 1922, he was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, a position he held until he resigned in 1934. Although Roxas played a secondary role on the Philippine political stage at that time, former President Quezon had already recognized him as the most ideal successor.</p>
<p>In 1946, Roxas defeated Osmeña in the election and was elected President. On July 4 of that year, the Republic of the Philippines was formally established, and Roxas became the first president of the country.</p>
<p>Roxas was familiar with the United States, even more so than some Americans. In the past, as the head of the independent mission, he visited the United States several times, spoke in Congress, broadcast to Americans, and left Americans with a deep and good impression. In the history of Philippine independence, Roxas stands alongside Quezon and Osmeña as one of the three great figures. Therefore, the death of Roxas is not only a loss for the Philippine people but also a major loss for the Far East Pacific region. (This newspaper's data room)</p>

<h3>Italy's Fate Depends on the General Election; Troops Mobilized to Prevent Incidents; Election Campaign Ended Last Midnight</h3>
<p>[United Press Rome, 16th] Italy's fate will depend on the election on the 18th. Prime Minister Gasperi ordered the mobilization of 330,000 troops, military police, and police on the 16th to take emergency measures in case of any eventuality.

Mr. Togliatti called Gasperi a stupid and lying man who dared not make guarantees. He denied that the Communist Party had lost power in northern Italy. He said that the Communist Party's plan has three goals: (1) to prevent the resurgence of reactionary forces and the revival of fascism; (2) to drive away the threat of another war; and (3) to respect the new constitution and make it a guarantee of the interests of workers. Mr. Togliatti also thanked the U.S. government for its aid to Italy and the U.S. military for liberating Italy, but he also emphasized and declared that he would never want the Americans to tie a rope around Italy's neck.</p>
<h3>Clash Between Communists and Police in Trieste</h3>

<h3>Results of Drawing for Type A Charity Housing Lottery Released; Winners Begin Exchanging for Certificates Today; Total Ticket Sales Exceed 170 Billion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The drawing for the Type A Charity Housing Lottery for Winter Relief was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road. Attending officials included Mayor Wu, Wang Xianqing, and Yuan Wenzhang. Supervisors included Wang Shiwei, representative of the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office, Huang Liang, Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Wang Guanqing, representative of the Municipal Government, Xiang Changquan, representative of the Municipal Council, and Xi Yushu, representative of the Municipal Association. More citizens from all walks of life went to watch than during the drawing of the Type B Lottery, estimated at about 3,000 people.</p>
<p>The drawing machine was still the same one used for the Type B Lottery drawing, borrowed from the Central Savings Society. The drawing method was also the same as last time, using three lottery balls. The first ball, Ball C, contained five characters such as "Heaven Earth Element Yellow." The second ball, Ball B, contained twelve numbers from 00 to 11, representing the first two digits of the charity lottery ticket number. The third ball, Ball A, contained 1,000 numbers from 000 to 999, representing the last three digits of the charity lottery ticket number. The result of combining the three balls after they were drawn was the winning number.</p>
<p>Three Improvements to Drawing Procedure</p>
<p>However, because some citizens wrote to Mayor Wu after the Type B Lottery drawing, pointing out that several procedures were not perfect, three reporters were temporarily invited yesterday to draw the balls and make separate improvements to demonstrate sincerity: (1) Some people thought that the numbers drawn were only reported by the Winter Relief Association staff, which could lead to errors or other situations. Yesterday, the drawn character ball numbers were reviewed by the supervisors and news reporters. (2) Some people suspected that the weights of the character balls were not the same. Yesterday, a small scale was specially prepared to test the weight, and it was confirmed on the spot that the weights were the same. (3) Some people were afraid of reading the numbers backwards. Yesterday, a line was added under the numbers on the number balls to avoid reading them backwards.</p>
<p>Mayor Reports No Deception of the Public</p>
<p>At the beginning of the drawing procedure, Mayor Wu reported the above improvement measures and said: "Most of the winners of the Type B Lottery have registered, and they have no connection with the Winter Relief Association. This shows that there is no wrongdoing. My work and the government's work must establish credibility with the public, and we will never deceive the public." Then, Director-General Wang Xianqing reported that all Type A tickets had been sold. As of 12:00 noon, 119.9518 billion yuan had been received for the tickets, and 48.2 million yuan had not been received. 500,469 Type B tickets were sold, and 50.4169 billion yuan was received for the tickets. The total amount of ticket sales was 170.4169 billion yuan. 1,198 Type A reservation vouchers had not been exchanged, totaling 59.6 million yuan. 927 Type B reservation vouchers had not been exchanged, totaling 92.7 million yuan. The total revenue from charity lottery tickets and reservation vouchers was 170.5692 billion yuan.</p>
<p>After the report, the supervisors inspected the lottery balls and number balls. Regarding the weight of the number balls, Wang Shiwei of the Supervisory Commissioner's Office and Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office and others selected several balls for testing, and they were all found to be equal. The mayor then asked Prosecutor Huang to report to the audience in front of the microphone. Before Huang had time to consider his words, he said, "It's probably very accurate." Someone in the stands shouted, "The word 'probably' is inappropriate." Huang quickly explained and at the same time asked Zhu Jie, a representative from the audience, to personally test the weight in front of the drawing table, confirming that the weights were equal, and the public's doubts were dispelled. After the inspection was completed, the drawing began. Mayor Wu personally drew the first winning number, which was the character "Hong" and the number 1034. The entire drawing was completed at 4:10 p.m., and the last group was the character "Cheng" and the number 07359. All the winning numbers are listed as above.</p>
<p>Continued Implementation Under Consideration</p>
<p>[Another Report] Winners of the Type A housing lottery tickets can register and exchange for "housing receipt certificates" at the Housing Charity Lottery Department of the Winter Relief Association on the fifth floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce starting today. According to Mayor Wu, the results of this housing charity lottery are very good because it can relieve refugees and solve the housing shortage. However, whether to continue with the second phase is still under consideration. If it can be realized in the future, a special organization may be set up to handle it.</p>

<h3>Annular Eclipse on the 9th, Daylight Like Dusk, Chinese and American Experts Go to Mogan Mountain to Prepare for Observation</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The solar eclipse on May 9th this year, as determined by the Academia Sinica and the Astronomical Observatory, is a type of "annular solar eclipse." This type of annular solar eclipse is different from a partial solar eclipse. At that time, as viewed from Earth, the moon will obscure the center of the sun, leaving only a ring visible. The circular portion seen in Shanghai will be slightly less than 10 percent of the sun, so at that time it will not be as dark as night, but only like a hazy dusk. The annular eclipse in this city will last from 8:45 AM to 12:06 PM. Other places in our country that can see it are Haimen, Wujiang in Jiangsu, Changshan, Deqing in Zhejiang, Xingguo, Zixi in Jiangxi, Suixi, Deqing, Wengyuan in Guangdong, etc. However, the visibility and time of the annular eclipse will vary in each location. A certain American university has joined with the Academia Sinica to send experts to the Mogan Mountain area in Wukang County, Zhejiang Province, to make large-scale observation preparations. They intend to take advantage of this solar eclipse to observe longitude detached from the earth's axis. In the future, after precise calculations and several repeated measurements, they can clarify the error rate of the longitude obtained in the past based on the geocentric theory, and make the most accurate correction.</p>
<h3>Returnees from Sakhalin Without Land to Cultivate, Taiwan Provincial Government Sends Telegram Declining, Social Bureau to Discuss Solutions</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Ninety-eight returnees from Sakhalin Island were originally scheduled to go to Taiwan on the 20th of this month for land reclamation and had negotiated a free transportation with China Revival Shipping Company. Yesterday, the Taiwan Provincial Government sent a telegram declining the offer. The telegram stated that among the returnees, there are 56 young children and 14 women, who have no ability to cultivate land. The remaining 28 men are mostly engaged in industry and commerce, and none of them have any experience in land reclamation. It was found that the returnees are from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shandong, and have no relatives to rely on in Taiwan. Their language is not understood and their customs are different. Moreover, there are unemployed compatriots in the province waiting for solutions. It is very difficult for this group of returnees to make a living in Taiwan. Before a solution is agreed upon, please do not come to Taiwan, etc. The group of returnees is currently residing at the Taiwan Association in Shanghai on Wujin Road. Whether they will still go to Taiwan or seek a living elsewhere will be discussed by the Municipal Social Bureau and other relevant agencies.</p>
<h3>Second Officer of Wanli Ship Rescued and Arrives in Shanghai, Passengers and Crew Awaiting Assistance in Rongcheng</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Wanli ship of Fumin Shipping Company sank after striking a reef near Beisheng Mountain. It has been five days since the incident.

<p>It continued: Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was received from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zizhong ship, which stated: "The Zizhong ship passed near the reef where the Wanli ship ran aground near Shengshan Cape at 9 am this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). A fishing boat called for help. It was identified as the Second Officer of the Wanli ship, Ai Huazhong, boarded the ship. According to the report, all 1,230 passengers and crew of the Wanli ship landed ashore. The passengers are temporarily staying in Rongcheng County, and the crew are temporarily staying in Longxu Village in Rongcheng Bay, where they are being entertained by local residents. However, the passengers' luggage and the identities of the soldiers must be verified before they can be released. It will take about two more days to take a boat back to Shanghai. This ship (Zizhong ship's own statement) should not stay for too long. Second Officer Ai instructed this ship to return to Shanghai, report first, and ask to notify each ship to pay attention to fishing boats when passing through that area (i.e., the area where the Wanli ship ran aground). The attached telegram hopes to be forwarded to Fumin Company, Captain Wu Mao Xian." It was found that the Zizhong ship returned to Shanghai from Huludao and is expected to arrive in port tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3>Standard for Spring Business Tax, Still Levied According to the Old Tax Rate</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The business tax rate was revised by the government in November last year, and it was restored to the method before October 1945. Three percent is levied on those who use the total business income as the standard for taxation, and six percent is levied on those who use the total business profit as the standard for taxation. The Municipal Council believes that at a time when industry and commerce are declining, the implementation of this revised tax rate would increase the burden on various industries and businesses. It requested the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original tax rate, but the Ministry of Finance did not approve it. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau told reporters: Although the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to maintain the original tax rate was not approved by the central government, the spring business tax in this city in 1948 will be levied at the old tax rate of 1.5% and 4%.</p>

<h3>Extortion Case Beyond Xu Jizhuang's Case: Peng Bingcheng, Former General Manager of Far Ocean Company, Suspected of Managing Gold and Currency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The military authorities in this city recently received a confidential report of an unprecedented major operation of managing black market gold and US dollars, involving wealthy capital. After days of investigation, they have obtained conclusive evidence. It is reported that the black market gold note operator is the Far Ocean Trading Company in the Hamilton Building. Peng Bingcheng, the former general manager of the company, was imprisoned for being related to the Xu Jizhuang corruption case. Now, someone has filed a complaint with the military authorities with strong evidence, accusing the company of operating a huge amount of black market buying and selling of gold and foreign currency during Peng Bingcheng's tenure. On July 19, 1947, alone, the amount of black market gold involved reached approximately 10,000 taels, and there were also some US dollars and Hong Kong dollars, which is shocking. The military authorities in this city believe that this case is not only a case outside of Peng Bingcheng and Xu Jizhuang, but also involves a senior government official, and are asking the superiors for instructions on how to handle it.</p>
<h3>National Bank Agrees to Settle Foreign Exchange for Fuel Needed by Public Utilities First, Research on Metal and Living Index Issues Will Be Discussed</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Council resolved to telegraph the Executive Yuan to consider stopping the continued application of the public utilities price calculation formula due to the drastic increase in public utilities prices, restoring the subsidy policy, and requesting that this formula be suspended from application starting in May before the central government decides on an appropriate method. Yesterday, Mayor Wu told reporters: The public utilities price calculation formula itself is not bad. The problem lies in the drastic fluctuations in foreign exchange. He is now trying to negotiate with President Zhang of the National Bank on foreign exchange needed for raw materials for public utilities, and asking for approval to settle foreign exchange one and a half to two months in advance to prevent price increases. President Zhang has agreed to this principle in principle.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] In order to stabilize the prices of public utilities, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau convened representatives of various power companies a few days ago to exchange preliminary views. The representatives believe that in order to stabilize prices, it is only possible to reduce costs and adopt indirect subsidy methods. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau visited President Zhang at 11:00 am yesterday. After the meeting, President Zhang agreed to allow the settlement of foreign exchange for fuel oil needed by public utilities in this city one and a half months in advance. In addition, the Fuel Management Committee can also sell more than 10,000 tons of coal for public utilities to use first. According to Director Zhao's analysis to reporters, the biggest factors affecting the prices of public utilities, in addition to oil and coal, are the cost of living index and the metal index. Among them, the cost of living index accounts for as much as 42% to 60% of the cost of each company. Therefore, in order to stabilize the cost of living index, all parties need to take the same steps to achieve results. In addition to oil and coal, the metal index issue will be studied in detail with people familiar with the metal industry, and the cost of living index will also be exchanged with relevant agencies to strive for stability. As for the issue of freezing the sales price of public utilities in May, from the standpoint of the Public Utilities Bureau, it will make its best efforts to reduce it to reduce the burden on citizens.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Tongji University Student Uprising Case: Eight Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment, Lenient Sentences Given Considering Young Students; Feng Liwen and Two Others Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Tongji University student uprising, a case involving assault and humiliation of Mayor Wu, which caused a great stir, was pronounced in court yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Judge Hu Zhichao entered the Second Criminal Court and had the defendants brought from the detention center. Judge Hu stood and read the main text of the verdict: "Huang Kelu and Pan Chengbang, as joint masterminds, are each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for publicly gathering a crowd to use violence and coercion. Sun Kezi and Qu Yuping, jointly and publicly gathered a crowd to implement violence and coercion, each sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Zhou Yongzhi, were jointly present at the scene to assist in the public gathering to use violence and coercion, each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Feng Liwen, Xiong Zonglie, and Wang Gongwei are all found not guilty." He then sat down and said: "Regarding Pan Chengbang, Tongji University stated that Pan was excellent in character and academics while at the school, and that the student was Shanghai's volleyball representative for the current National Games. He is permitted to be released on bail. Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Zhou Yongzhi, the four defendants whose detention period has exceeded their sentences, are therefore permitted to be released on bail or placed under supervision outside of custody. Feng Liwen, Xiong Zonglie, and Wang Gongwei are permitted to be released on bail or placed under supervision outside of custody. The remaining Gong Kelu, Sun Kezi, and Qu Yuping are to remain in custody." Excerpts of the reasoning behind the verdict in this case are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Huang Kelu and Pan Chengbang:</p>
<p>Defendant Huang Kelu is a standing committee member of the Tongji University Student Union and a member of the presidium. Defendant Pan Chengbang is a standing director of the union, also a member of the presidium, and jointly served with Huang Kelu as chairman of the petition group. Both have admitted this in court. The petition on January 29 was led by the presidium, so the students' advance and retreat must have been orchestrated by the presidium. This is further clarified by Wu Hong's statement at the police station that "charging out of the school gate was ordered by the presidium" (see page 40 of the investigation volume). Although this petition originated from a resolution by representatives of various departments, which was delegated to the presidium for execution, it cannot be considered to have originated from the defendants' incitement. However, knowing that the military police were heavily surrounding and preventing advancement, they still ordered a charge, thereby disrupting order at the time and place. They should jointly bear the responsibility as masterminds of publicly gathering a crowd to use violence and coercion, and are convicted under the latter part of Article 150 of the Criminal Law. In addition to masterminding the disruption of order, Defendant Shen Chengbang also implemented violence, as confirmed by Zhu Yifu in both the investigation and trial. As the mastermind who also implemented violence, he should be sentenced as the mastermind. However, the defendants are all young students who acted on a moment of emotional impulse, so the sentences are lenient.</p>
<p>(2) Sun Kezi and Qu Yuping:</p>
<p>Huang Kelu stated at the police station, "It is a fact that the mayor was beaten." Defendant Sun Kezi crossed the ditch to beat the mayor, which Zhu Yifu not only clearly testified to, but Defendant Sun Kezi also stated to the police when asked, "When the police arrested and photographed students, did you loudly question the mayor in a fierce manner, ignoring objections?" He replied, "Yes, this was disrespectful to the mayor, and I now admit I was wrong." He also admitted in the trial to "speaking impolitely." By comparing and corroborating these statements, it can be generally seen that he used violence. Defendant Qu Yuping also physically assaulted Mayor Wu, as testified by Zhang Jugong in both the investigation and trial, which he cannot deny. Considering the two defendants' actions, they were not solely aimed at obstructing official duties but implemented violence. However, since they publicly gathered a large number of people with the potential for further increase, they met the conditions for publicly gathering a crowd under the Criminal Law. Furthermore, they disobeyed the orders of the local administrative head to disperse and instead surged forward together to implement violence, clearly intending to disrupt order at the time, which aligns with the latter part of Article 150 of the Criminal Law. They are therefore convicted of disrupting order, and considering that the defendants are young first-time offenders, the sentences are also lenient.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Zongshu, Wang Weixin, Zhang Jingyao, and Zhou Yongzhi:</p>
<p>A. Although Defendant Wang Zongshu was not a leader of the petition group, even if it cannot be proven how he implemented violence, his presence at the scene to assist is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>B. Defendant Wang Weixin was the general commander of the petition group, as he admitted in court and was confirmed by Zhou Zhiyu. Although it cannot be proven how he implemented violence or coercion, his presence at the scene to assist is also beyond doubt.</p>
<p>C. Defendant Zhang Jingyao admitted at the police station that he held a petition flag and charged towards the surrounding police officers and was arrested at the time. Although this cannot immediately be considered implementing violence, he cannot evade responsibility for assisting at the scene.</p>
<p>D. Defendant Zhou Yongzhi admitted that he was standing by the ditch in front of the third team, and Zhu Yifu stated that he charged across the ditch. Therefore, his presence at the scene to assist is hardly doubtful.</p>
<p>In summary, the four defendants should be convicted under the first part of Article 150 of the Criminal Law. However, their criminal motive was a moment of emotional impulse, and they are young students. The sentences should be lenient to show leniency.</p>
<p>(4) Feng Liwen, Xiong Zonglie, and Wang Gongwei:</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu proposed a five-person meeting for mediation, Defendant Feng Liwen went to invite alumnus Huang Bosun, and chaos erupted when he held Huang Bosun's business card and read it aloud to the group. Therefore, it can be generally seen that he did not participate in the presidium's planning of the charge, so he should be declared not guilty. Although Defendant Xiong Zonglie shouted the slogan "Students, don't be discouraged," it is said that he shouted it afterward at night in the classroom on the second floor, so it is difficult to immediately convict him. Although Hu Liping, a student from Guangfu Middle School, testified during the investigation that Defendant Wang Gongwei beat the mayor, Tongji University students Du Chenglang and Li Dabing unanimously testified that Wang Gongwei was in front of the kitchen door at the time of the conflict. Zhu Yifu also stated in court, "I didn't see Wang Gongwei," and Zhang Jugong solemnly stated, "The one named Wang with the blind left eye did not beat the mayor. I didn't say he beat the mayor." Zhu and Zhang were always beside Mayor Wu that day and their observations are more reliable. Therefore, their testimonies are more credible than Hu Liping's. Thus, he is also declared not guilty. Based on the above reasoning, in conjunction with Article 291, the first part of Article 292, and Article 293, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 28 and Article 150 of the Criminal Law, the verdict is as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3>Rising Production Prices Boost Confidence, Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Flour Rises, Mixed Grains Mostly Up, Few Down</h3>
<p>The rice market continued to trend upward, with the early market being the strongest. Sellers continued the previous day's gains, raising prices again. In addition, quotes from Wuxi rose, boosting confidence further, and the local market eagerly bought at lower prices. Both the North and South markets reported increases of 100,000 yuan, but the North market only added 50,000 yuan to white glutinous rice and indica rice, with the rest also rising by 100,000 yuan. Special grade glutinous rice was 3.95 million yuan, but the market situation later showed slight relaxation. Arrivals yesterday increased, totaling 7,020 shih in the North and South markets.</p>
<p>Flour rose slowly. The previously quiet North market slightly purchased army supply flour yesterday. Old car flour and other miscellaneous brands were not inquired about, so only army supply flour was popular, priced 5,000 yuan higher than old car flour, rising by about 10,000 yuan. Bran rose by 120,000 yuan. The wheat factory disk remained unchanged at 2.05 million yuan.</p>

Guangdong raw peanuts were being continuously purchased, rising by another 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking oil continued to rise slightly. Oil mills offered very little soybean oil, with only Tongfeng offering at 8.25 million yuan. Most others were reclaiming transactions. Fresh vegetable and sesame oil were both strong. Xiao Jun sesame oil rose by 250,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 15,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Rice Prices Steady</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper, Suzhou, 16th] Today's rice prices in Suzhou showed a fluctuating trend, with both buyers and sellers cautious and steady. The market opened with rough glutinous rice at 3.33 million yuan and white rough rice at 3.78 million yuan, unchanged from the previous day.</p>

<h3>Fuzhou Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 16th] Rong rice prices opened today, breaking the 5.5 million mark. The price increase is due to continuous smuggling at sea, transporting to Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen for profit. The local price is now over 6 million per 100 jin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Initially Firm, Then Weak</h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday advanced and then retreated. It opened with a low disk, with the 16th period coarse sugar warehouse order, for delivery the day after tomorrow, adding only 480,000 yuan. Then, rumors suddenly spread that foreign exchange was about to rise, and the market rose in a frenzy, adding up to 570,000 yuan. The period for next week added 700,000 yuan. Ultimately, the rumors proved to be unfounded, and confidence softened again, with prices gradually declining. Later dates still added 500,000 yuan, to 4.94 million yuan, the same as yesterday's settlement. Next week's period is estimated to add 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>For the 17th period warehouse order, except for crystal sugar, which added 330,000 yuan in transactions, spot coarse sugar was uniquely firm, up 150,000 yuan. Vehicle white and refined sugar each rose by 100,000 yuan, and 200-jin bag medium sugar also rose by 50,000 yuan. Native sugar rose and fell unevenly. Hainan and cotton red turned weak, while Jian sugar reported firm.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Except for the new Longjing from Wenhang this year, which continued to arrive and whose quality aged daily, leading to further softening, other domestic teas remained quiet as both buyers and sellers held firm. Prices also fluctuated as before. As for export varieties, only green tea destined for North Africa saw activity as exporters continued to make up for shortages. However, pricing did not increase due to the condition of the goods and generally presented a steady-to-slightly bullish tone.</p>
<h3>Chinese Farmers Bank to Provide Loans for Chemical Fertilizers</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry entrusted the Chinese Farmers Bank with the continuous lending of 85,000 tons of chemical fertilizers transported from the United States to various regions. The trial application proved to be highly effective. This year, the bank has ordered 20,000 tons of this fertilizer from the United States, the first batch of which will arrive in Shanghai on the 27th of this month, with the rest arriving by the end of the month. Physical loans will be provided at that time. It is estimated that each jin of fertilizer can increase rice production by three jin. If the principle of recovering two jin of rice for each jin of fertilizer loaned is followed, farmers can still earn one jin of profit. This measure is beneficial for encouraging increased production and for the government to control materials.</p>
<h3>Unsettled Situation, Shanghai Stocks Rise and Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was dominated by short-term players, and the situation was unsettled and very volatile. Hong Kong Electric saw contractions, and price speculation was endless, easily reversing the trend. The results were both very slight increases and declines.</p>
<p>Initially, the market was weak due to the issuance of treasury bills and tight money in banks. Wing On Textile debuted at 1810 yuan, retreated to a low of 1745 yuan, and 145 and others bought at the low. External stimulus then arose, and foreign stocks rose again, rebounding to 1816 yuan. Due to many sellers, it retreated to 1790 yuan, then advanced again to 1840 yuan. Around noon, due to insufficient support from the bulls, the midday close was 1797 yuan. Compared to the previous close, China New, Xinyi, Datong, Commercial Press, and Wing On Public rose slightly, National Goods, Lilian Match, and Tongyi were flat, and the rest declined slightly.

Baisha opened in the morning at 2.58 million, rose from 2.57 million to 2.65 million, and then slightly declined. In the afternoon, there was less support, and the market closed around 2.56 million.

<h3>Shanghai Yarn Control Office Signs Cotton Purchase Contract with Hubei Cotton Merchants, Commissioning Purchase of 200,000 Dan to Be Delivered in Three Months</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The yarn control office and the Hubei cotton merchant's cotton purchase contract was officially signed yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm in the meeting room of the yarn control office. Yuan, Chairman of the Yarn Control Office, and the heads of various related departments, and Cheng Shiju, representatives of Hubei cotton merchants, and 10 others were present at the time. First, Pan Jianliang, Director of the Procurement and Transportation Department of the Yarn Control Office, officially read the original text of the contract. The main points of the contract were that the commissioned purchase quantity was tentatively set at 300,000 market dan, for a period of three months, starting from May to July; divided into 100,000 dan in May, 150,000 dan in June, and 50,000 dan in July. If completed ahead of schedule within the time limit, the association will reward it. If it cannot proceed according to the scheduled progress, it will be deducted from the guaranteed cotton. However, special difficulties will be regarded as exceptions. Then, after Chairman Yuan inquired whether there were any objections, both parties signed and sealed. At this point, Chairman Yuan delivered a speech to the representatives of the cotton merchants signing the contract, raising three points: (1) Hope to work hard to complete the responsibilities stipulated in the contract. (2) Hope that everyone will not harm the public for private gain during the purchase and transportation period. (3) Do not use tricks on cotton farmers, and strive for reasonable cotton collection procedures. The cotton merchant representatives also raised three points of hope: 1. The revolving funds should be allocated quickly, 2. The delivery and weighing procedures should be simple, 3. Overcome transportation difficulties. At the same time, I hope that the Yarn Control Committee will treat the commissioned purchase units equally if there are supplementary clauses. Chairman Yuan then stated that he would negotiate improvements at any time.</p>
<h3>Improved Sales, Slightly Increased Buying Interest, Most Cotton Yarn and Cloth Recovered</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was steady and firm. Rumors that foreign exchange rates would rise again slightly increased interest from all parties. 21-count Double Horse opened in the morning and broke through the 141 million yuan mark, opening from 141.1 million yuan and once rising to 144 million yuan. With many sellers near closing, there was a slight decline, eventually closing at 143 million yuan, recovering 4 million yuan. Except for 42-count Blue Phoenix falling by 3 million yuan, the rest saw demand and supply matching, with little fluctuation. 32-count various grades of reproduction industries slightly advanced, and market prices mostly recovered between 1 million and 3 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse and other customer sales became smoother, and the local market also purchased, with market prices mostly rising 2 to 3 million yuan. 16-count and 10-count various grades were also firm, up between 1.5 million and 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning's opening for cotton cloth was stimulated by rumors of foreign exchange rate changes and quickly turned upward. Jiangxi customers made strong advances, and Longtou fine cloth advanced more than 1,000 pieces. Due to turnover issues, dye factories continued to sell at high prices. Retail cloth merchants were hesitant to take action, and buyers and sellers were in a strong standoff. Longtou fine cloth recovered to 4.77 million yuan from 4.88 million yuan. For the remaining lower-grade fine cloths, Hankou merchants made advances, and they were also popular. 190 twill fell 50,000 to 100,000.</p>
<p>Spinning and Construction Sales Yarn</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday (16th), the Spinning and Construction Company opened for sale twelve types of cotton yarn, and the approved selling prices are as follows: 20-count Golden Rooster 127 million yuan, 10-count Liuma 72 million yuan, 16-count Red Moon 94 million yuan, 32-count Xiantao 154 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Xiantao 174 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Fengnian 178 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight 174 million yuan, 40-count TK Color Ball 224 million yuan.</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Turns Bullish</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market situation turned bullish due to the slightly firm yarn market. With the Flower Control Office opening up its wide scale, sellers were eager to sell, and transactions were still being completed. Market prices for various grades were up around 100,000. 400 bales were traded. The delivery price to the public treasury opened at 24.5 million for Jingyang, 23.5 million, Shashi at 21.4 million, and Han fine at 20.4 million. The underwater price opened at 17.4 million for Hai Tip Jian, and the underwater price for Zhoupu seed flower was 4.32 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware Association Requests Changes to the Import Allocation Quota Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hardware Business Association presented a petition to the Trade and Assistance Office of the Import Association yesterday, requesting changes to the import quota allocation method for hardware, on the grounds that it was unfair and increased the costs of production factories. The reasons are copied below:</p>
<p>(1) Under the current system, 50% of the total hardware import quota is allocated to distributors. The allocation method is determined by the individual import firms. In the past, import firms acted as agents, charging commissions, and their legal profits rarely exceeded 10%. Now, they are taking advantage of the import quotas and the foreign exchange provided by the government to transform their business practices. To correct these problems, the following two points should be implemented: (A) Following the example of the Shanghai Industrial Association allocating foreign exchange to factories, the distribution of hardware import quotas to distributors should be collectively discussed and allocated by the relevant trade association of distributors. Import firms should not be allowed to freely allocate the quotas, to fulfill their selfish desires. (B) When import firms act as agents, a legal profit must be stipulated when the government provides foreign exchange. When hardware merchants order from import firms and resell to factory users, a legal profit must also be stipulated.</p>
<p>(2) The current regulations for applying for non-quota imports require factory certification. However, there are many practical difficulties, and even if it is reluctantly implemented, there are still inaccuracies and omissions. For example, for certain tools or accessories required by various factories (such as military knife steel drill bits, grinding wheels, etc.), the sizes are different, the styles are distinct, and the required periods are not always the same. When import firms order from foreign manufacturers, they cannot order less than dozens or hundreds of pieces. It is impossible to jointly sign an order with each factory. If one factory signs the order, it is inevitable that falsehoods will be fabricated, and abuses will occur. Especially when needs arise in other cities and rural areas, it is easy to miss the opportunity, resulting in abnormal supply of imported materials. To resolve these difficulties and ensure a smooth supply of materials, we propose to change the method to allow members of the association to directly apply for commercial association certification, which is more reasonable and practical.</p>

<h3>International Friendship Competition to Be Held During the National Games, Adding Ball Sports Events Besides Athletics, Inviting Foreign Nationals in China to Participate</h3>
<p>Two months ago, the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai learned that China's 7th National Games would be held on May 5th and sent a letter to the two National Games Organizing Committees requesting permission to send representatives to participate in the competition. This matter was discussed at the second meeting of the National Games Organizing Committee, and it was decided that on the sixth day after the opening of the National Games, time would be set aside to hold an international friendly competition, with representatives from both Chinese and Western sides responsible for preparation. The enemy committee has now been formed, with nine members, and held its first committee meeting at the U.S. Navy Club at the racecourse yesterday.

<p>It is also reported that most of the National Games venue has been renovated. Further steps are now being taken to organize the environment and traffic outside the venue, and evergreen trees are being planted. The front of the venue is painted in autumn incense color, restoring the heroic appearance of the 6th National Games. However, the six large characters "Shanghai Municipal Sports Ground" on the horizontal plaque above the gate have not yet been written. It was originally intended to ask Mayor Wu to write them himself. However, Wu believes that the construction of the year-round sports ground was entirely due to the efforts of former Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and the original inscription was also written by Wu Tiecheng himself. Therefore, now that it has been renovated again, these six characters should still be written by Wu Tiecheng to commemorate his achievements and to make a memory of this event. Therefore, the Municipal Works Bureau has sent a letter to Wu requesting him to write them. Once it is received, the entire project can be completed with the addition of paint.</p>

<h3>Feng Jingxiang Gives Way to Wu Qixiang - Hu Hao Asks for Wang Xinheng's Understanding</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the national football team's roster for the World Games, there has been widespread dissatisfaction with the omission of domestic right-back Wu Qixiang. The media has been unanimously critical of Hu Hao, a member of the selection committee. Yesterday, Hu Hao sent a letter to Shen Qiuyan, director of the China East News Agency in this city, to defend himself and ask Wang Xinheng of the Qingbai Sports Association for understanding. He stated that Xingdao was willing to give up a spot on the team to allow Wu Qixiang to be selected. The original letter stated: "During the selection of football players for the World Games, I specifically nominated Wu Qixiang, but it was not approved by the other members present. Fei Chunhua also nominated him, but with the same result. All of this was witnessed by Wang Rong, Li Mo, and others. Afterwards, I even sent a special letter to Brother Xinheng to explain the matter. Now that Mr. Rong Qizhao has returned to Shanghai, my only solution is to have Feng Jingxiang withdraw, creating a vacancy for Wu Qixiang. I can ask Dr. Rong to discuss this in Shanghai. Once the quotas are settled, this matter should be resolved smoothly. That is my intention, and I hope Xinheng can understand."</p>
<h3>Public Funding Changed to Scholarships - Ministry of Education Provides Explanation - Original Publicly Funded Students Receive Funding Until Graduation - Scholarship Students Limited to Those with Excellent Exam Results</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] It is reported that the Ministry of Education recently discussed the issue of rectifying academic standards at the invitation of relevant parties. Our reporter interviewed Tian Peilin, Vice Minister of Education, tonight, who said: The Ministry of Education, due to the National Assembly representatives coming to Nanjing for a meeting, discussed the issue of publicly funded students with the presidents of various universities among the representatives. The system of publicly funded students began during the War of Resistance. It should have been abolished after the victory and repatriation. Last year, the Political Consultative Conference also advocated revising the publicly funded system, which was finalized by the Executive Yuan to be changed to scholarships. Therefore, since August last year, except for normal school students, students returning to school from the Youth Army, and students from the border areas who are stipulated to receive public funding, there is no public funding for others, only scholarships. Existing publicly funded students will continue to receive funding until graduation. In addition, there is a relief fund program for students whose families are in the communist-controlled areas. Scholarships are given until graduation, while relief funds are stopped three months after the student's hometown is recovered. Scholarship students are selected based on excellent exam results. Therefore, freshmen in universities who meet the scholarship requirements can receive scholarships, but it is not as widespread as the previous public funding system. However, because the name of the scholarship quota is similar to the number of publicly funded students before the change, there is a lot of misunderstanding from the outside world, thinking that scholarships are public funding. In the future, the Ministry will formally explain this program to correct the view. Minister Zhu reported on public funding matters to the National Assembly on the 14th, which has been thoroughly explained. Minister Zhu emphasized: No country in the world completely provides university students with food expenses. At a time when compulsory education in China is not yet widespread, it is not only unreasonable to use people's hard-earned money to promote compulsory education in primary schools instead of providing university students with food expenses, but also very unfair!</p>

<h3>On the Name and Translator of the Han Translation of Aśvaghoṣa's Buddhacarita</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yiliang</p>
<p>Among the classics recording the life of Śākyamuni, the earliest is the Xiuxing Benqi Jing (修行本起經), translated by Zhu Dali and Kang Mengqun in the Later Han Dynasty. Then there is the Taizi Ruiying Benqi Jing (太子瑞應本起經), translated by Zhi Qian of the Wu Dynasty; the Puyao Jing (普曜經), translated by Zhu Fahu of the Western Jin Dynasty; the Guoqu Xianzai Yinguo Jing (過去現在因果經), translated by Guṇabhadra of the Liu Song Dynasty; the Fo Benxing Ji Jing (佛本行集經), translated by Jñānagupta of the Sui Dynasty; the Fangguang Dazhuangyan Jing (方廣大莊嚴經), translated by Divākara of the Tang Dynasty; and the Zhongxu Mohe Di Jing (衆許摩訶帝經), translated by Dharmadeva of the Zhao Song Dynasty. These classics all narrate in different ways. Some start from the birth of Siddhartha Gautama of the Śākya clan, and some start from the ancestors of the Śākya clan. Still others start from when Śākyamuni was a Brahmin named Shanxian (善憲) in a previous life, and met the Dīpaṃkara Buddha and first generated the Bodhi mind. Yet others start from the opening of heaven and earth. Because the transmissions differ, the contents are mutually different, and each has its place in the study of Buddhist history. However, from a literary point of view, none of the above is considered important. The two most important are the Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經) translated by Sengqiepo of the Liu Song Dynasty and the Buddhacarita, traditionally translated by Dharmarakṣa of the Northern Liang Dynasty. This short essay will discuss the original name and translator of the latter's Han translation.</p>
<p>The Buddhacarita is one of the few Sanskrit originals still extant in the vast sea of Han-translated Buddhist scriptures. Both the Han and Tibetan translations have twenty-eight chapters, but unfortunately only the first half of the original Sanskrit text, fourteen chapters, remains. Strangely, the discovered manuscripts only extend to the middle of the fourteenth chapter, suggesting that the second half was lost long ago. E. B. Cowell's edited version goes up to the seventeenth chapter, but after examination, the latter half of the fourteenth chapter onwards is added by later generations and is not the original of Aśvaghoṣa. The best version now is E. H. Johnston's edition, published as the thirty-first volume of the Punjab University Oriental Publications, with an English translation. In the history of Indian literature, the Buddhacarita belongs to the category of court poetry (Kauys). It is said that such poetry must discuss the principles of governing the country and behaving as a person, describe women, describe battles, and use relatively ornate and decorative phrases. The Buddhacarita successfully achieves all these points. The principles of governing the country and behaving as a person are spoken by Udāyi, as seen in the Liyu Pin (離欲品, Chapter on Detachment). The Ouxi Pin (歐息品, Chapter on Stopping) describes the women rushing to see the prince when he goes out for a trip, and the Liyu Pin describes the various appearances of the palace women sleeping at night when the prince sees them. There are extremely delicate and thorough descriptions of women's clothing, movements, and psychology. However, the Chinese translation omits many of these, probably because it is considered inconsistent with the solemnity of the classics, not knowing that the original Sanskrit text was a "poem" rather than a "sutra." As for the embellishment and ornamentation of phrases, especially the two methods most favored by Indian literati—one is imaginative metaphor, and the other is to use words with the same sound but different meanings to play games—they are even more eye-catching. However, the Han translation is limited by language and cannot express the second point. Regarding the general evaluation of the Buddhacarita, we can quote Yijing's words as a representative. He said that Aśvaghoṣa "also composed the Fo Benxing Shi (佛本行詩, Buddha-conduct Poem), the large version of which, if translated, would be more than ten volumes. It describes the Tathagata from the royal palace to the twin Sala trees. The entire Buddha-dharma of a lifetime is compiled into poetry. No one in the five Indias and the South Sea does not recite it. The meaning is clear, the words are few, and it can capture many meanings. It also makes the reader feel happy and forget fatigue." (Nanhai Jigui Neifa Zhuan 南海寄歸內法傳, Chapter 4, 条讚詠之禮)</p>
<p>After reading Yijing's words, two questions arise. The first is the question of the era of the Han translation of the Buddhacarita. He said, "the large version, if translated, would be more than ten volumes," as if it had not yet been translated into Chinese. However, the Chu Sanzang Ji Ji (出三藏記集) compiled by Sengyou of the Liang Dynasty as early as Volume 2 already recorded it, which is undoubtedly the translated version we see now. Why is it that someone as erudite as Yijing seems not to have seen it? The annotations to Takakusu Junjiro's translation of the Jigui Zhuan and Hirakawa Akira's A Study of Sanskrit Buddha Biography Literature have not answered this question. I think Sengyou's record is naturally credible, or perhaps Yijing did not carry many scriptures with him when he was writing books in the South Sea, so he missed the inspection? Perhaps he was only trying to explain the amount of the book, so he said "if translated"? The second question is more important and more complex, namely the question of the name and translator of the Han translation of the Buddhacarita. Volume 2 of Sengyou's Chu Sanzang Ji Ji has "Fo Suoxing Zan (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes," with a note stating "also named Ma Ming Pusa Zan (馬鳴菩薩讚, Eulogy of Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa), or Fo Benxing Zan (佛本行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Conduct)." The translator was Dou Yun of the Liu Song Dynasty. (See also Volume 5, Biography of Baoyun) Volume 4 also has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in five volumes," in the Lost Translation Miscellaneous Sutras Record, which means the translator is unknown. Volume 2 of Fa Jing's Zhongjing Mulu (衆經目錄) of the Sui Dynasty has "Fo Benxing Zan Jing Zhuan (佛本行讚經傳, Transmission of the Eulogy Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in seven volumes, translated by Baoyun in the Yuanjia years of the Song Dynasty," and also has "Fo Suoxing Zan Jing Zhuan (佛所行讚經傳, Transmission of the Eulogy Sutra of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes, also named Ma Ming Zan (馬鳴讚, Eulogy of Aśvaghoṣa), translated by Dou Yun of the Jin Dynasty." Fei Changfang's Lidai Sanbao Ji (歷代三寶記) Volume 9 has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in five volumes," translated by Dharmarakṣa. Volume 10 has "Fo Suoxing Zan Jing (佛所行讚經, Sutra of the Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes," Dou Yun Chan. Daoxuan's Datang Neidian Lu (大唐內典錄) is the same as the Sanbao Ji. Volume 5 of Mingquan's Dazhou Kanding Zhongjing Mulu (大周刊定衆經目錄) of the Wu Zhou Dynasty in the Mahayana Re-translated Sutras section has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in one section of five volumes," translated by Dharmarakṣa, and also has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in one section of seven volumes," translated by Dou Yun. Volume 4 of Zhisheng's Kaiyuan Shijiao Lu (開元釋敎錄) under Dharmarakṣa Translation has "Fo Suoxing Zan Jing Zhuan (佛所行讚經傳, Transmission of the Eulogy Sutra of the Buddha's Deeds) in five volumes." The note says: "Some call it Sutra, without the word Transmission. Some call it Transmission, without the word Sutra. Created by Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa. Also called Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct), see Changfang's Record." Volume 5 under Baoyun Translation has "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in seven volumes," with a note saying "Also called Fo Benxing Zan Zhuan (佛本行讚傳, Transmission of the Eulogy of the Buddha's Conduct), appeared at the Liuhe Mountain Temple. Some say five volumes, see Sengyou's Xianchang Neidian (賢唱內典) and other records. The Biographies of Eminent Monks says Fo Benxing Zan Jing (佛本行讚經, Sutra of the Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds)." The names of the scriptures, translators, and number of volumes recorded by various families are mostly different and cannot be investigated. Tokiwa Daijō said in his Complete Record of Sutra Translations from the Later Han to the Song and Qi (page 910): "Sengyou considers Fo Suoxing Zan (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) to be translated by Baoyun, which seems to be followed. And the one translated by Dharmarakṣa should follow Fei Changfang's saying, which is the Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in Youlu's record." His words are merely speculation and have no evidence.</p>
<p>If we look closely at the words of the various catalogs cited above, we know that the number of volumes is due to errors in the writing of numbers during copying, or due to the paper relationship when writing scriptures, and the number of volumes has increased or decreased. For example, Volume 9 of Lidai Sanbao Ji says "Luoyang Qielan Ji (洛陽伽藍記, Records of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang) in five volumes," and the note says: "Or it is a large volume." Naturally, those who combined it into a large volume may have used smaller characters, or the paper may have been longer. Thus, the same book has a distinction between five volumes and one volume. Also, the Pelliot 342 manuscript collected in Paris (according to the photograph in the Qinghua University Library) is the account book of a temple, and one part is the "Scripture Catalog." Among them are "Miscellaneous Tibetan Scriptures in eight volumes" and "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) in six volumes," which are inconsistent with the number of volumes currently transmitted. Generally, it is also based on the actual number of scrolls in the written manuscript and is not the original number of volumes. Therefore, we can temporarily ignore the difference in the number of volumes in the scripture records cited above. The meanings of "Benxing" (本行, Original Conduct) or "Suoxing" (所行, Deeds) in the scripture name are the same, and we can also ignore them. Or calling it "Jing" (經, Sutra) or "Zhuan" (傳, Transmission) is also not in the original text, and the Chinese translation is arbitrarily added, which can be excluded. The most reliable basis for our current reasoning is the existence or absence of the word "Zan" (讚, Eulogy).</p>
<p>The difference between the two scriptures in Fa Jing's catalog is only the difference between the words "Suo" (所) and "Xing" (行), and both are translated by Baoyun. Mingquan's catalog is called "Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct)," and says that it and Jñānagupta's Fo Benxing Ji Jing (佛本行集經, Collected Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) are both "different translations of the same version," which can be said to be lying with eyes open! The Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) and the Fo Suoxing Zan (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) are certainly not the same book, and they have nothing to do with the huge Fo Benxing Ji Jing (佛本行集經, Collected Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct), how can they be called "same version"? Therefore, the records in these two catalogs are not worth discussing. For the sake of clarity, I will list the statements of the remaining four scripture records in the following table:</p>
<p>From the table above, we know that from the Liang Dynasty to the early Tang Dynasty, it was always believed that the one translated by Baoyun was called "Xing Zan" (行讚, Conduct Eulogy), and the other was called "Xing Jing" (行經, Conduct Sutra). I think this earliest statement is correct. In other words, the current "Fo Benxing Jing" (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct) should originally be called "Fo Suoxing Zan" (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds), and the "Fo Suoxing Zan" (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds) should be called "Fo Benxing Jing" (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct). What is the reason?</p>
<p>Aśvaghoṣa's poem is originally named Buddhacarita in Sanskrit, which can be translated as "Fo Suoxing (佛所行, Buddha's Deeds)" or "Fo Benxing (佛本行, Buddha's Conduct)," but there is no implication of "Jing" (經, Sutra) or "Zan" (讚, Eulogy) in it. Yijing called it "Fo Benxing Shi (佛本行詩, Buddha-conduct Poem)," which is extremely correct. The Chinese may have added the word "Jing" (經, Sutra) because it is regarded as an internal Buddhist scripture. But there is no reason to call it "Zan" (讚, Eulogy), because the entire article is a biography of Śākyamuni and has no function of "Zan" (讚, Eulogy). Looking at the current version of the Fo Benxing Jing (佛本行經, Sutra of the Buddha's Conduct), it is very qualified to be called "Zan" (讚, Eulogy). The Inyuan Pin (因綠品, Chapter on Causes and Conditions) at the beginning records that after the Tathagata's Nirvana, the gods asked the Vajra Warrior to recount the Buddha's virtues. The Warrior said: "Wanting to praise the Buddha's merits, no one can exhaust all of them. I wish to inherit the Buddha's divine power, so that my intentions will not be mistaken. I can proclaim a little, praising the Buddha's virtues and goodness." Zan (讚) is like praise. The second chapter is the "Cheng Zan Rulai Pin" (稱讚如來品, Chapter on Praising the Tathagata), briefly describing the Tathagata's deeds. This chapter is about the eight kings dividing the relics, and also says: "At that time, the Secret Trace Warrior widely said this Dharma to the gods and humans, successively explaining the Buddha's original conduct and virtues. ... Even if all the Arhats have wisdom like Śāriputra, praising the Buddha's virtues for kalpas cannot end. Moreover, my wisdom is shallow and limited to what I have seen and heard." Isn't this a thorough "Fo Suoxing Zan" (佛所行讚, Eulogy of the Buddha's Deeds)?</p>
<p>The above proves that the current "Xing Jing" (行經, Conduct Sutra) should originally be called "Xing Zan" (行讚, Conduct Eulogy). Before Daoxuan, this scripture was regarded as translated by Dou Yun, and Zhisheng began to say that it was translated by Dharmarakṣa. With the problem of the scripture name solved, what about the problem of the translator? I think Sengyou's statement should also be regarded as correct. The first is of course because of the adjacency of time and place. Baoyun died in the twenty-sixth year of Yuanjia in the Song Dynasty (449 AD), and Sengyou died in the seventeenth year of Dajian in the Liang Dynasty (518 AD), not long apart. Sengqiepo translated the scriptures in Liuhe, within the territory of the Southern Dynasties. Sengyou should be clear about Baoyun's work. There is also other evidence that the work originally named Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) and now named Xing Jing (行經, Conduct Sutra) was not translated by Dharmarakṣa. The translation of Sanskrit classics is often dictated by the Indian or Western Region translator, and then recorded by others. Because it has gone through this level, it is not easy to examine the translator's personality from the writing style or the words used in the translation. However, the transliteration of proper nouns should be relatively fixed. The same translator should use the same Chinese characters to transliterate the same proper nouns when translating different classics. Now, it seems that all are translated from Sanskrit texts. Compare the transliterations of some proper nouns seen in Baoyun's Xing Jing (寶雲行經, Baoyun's Conduct Sutra) and Dharmarakṣa's Jin Guangming Jing (金光明經, Golden Light Sutra) and Da Ban Niepan Jing (大般涅槃經, Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra), and it will be clear that the Xing Jing (行經, Conduct Sutra) was not written by Dharmarakṣa, and Zhisheng's statement is completely wrong.</p>
<p>Since the current Xing Jing (行經, Conduct Sutra) should originally be called Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) and is known to have been translated by Dou Yun in the Liu Song Dynasty, the problem of the translator of the current Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) is also half solved. It cannot have been written by Baoyun either, because the transliterations of the two are quite different. Take a look at the table below:</p>
<p>Fa Jing and Mingquan believe that both were translated by Dou Yun, which is of course unbelievable. I also think that Fei Changfang and Daoxuan's claim that the current Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy) was translated by Dharmarakṣa is highly questionable. The Biographies of Eminent Monks by Huijiao and the Biography of Dharmarakṣa in Sengyou's Chu Sanzang Ji Ji (出三藏記集, Collection of Records Concerning the Tripitaka) on which he based his work record Dharmarakṣa's translations of the Da Ji (大集, Great Collection), Niepan (涅槃, Nirvana) and other scriptures, not to mention the Bei Hua (悲華, Karuṇāpuṇḍarīka Sūtra), Hai Longwang (海龍王, Sāgaranāgarājaparipṛcchā) and other scriptures, but do not mention this work by Aśvaghoṣa. If it was written by Dharmarakṣa, such an important classic should never have been omitted by both. The transliterations of Xing Zan (行讚, Conduct Eulogy), such as "Luohuanluo (羅喚羅)" and "Axiuluo (阿修羅)," do match Dharmarakṣa's other translations. However, there are too few items to serve as a basis. Judging from the tacit proof of Sengyou's and Huijiao's biographies of Dharmarakṣa, we still believe in the Chu Sanzang Ji Ji (出三藏記集, Collection of Records Concerning the Tripitaka), and believe that Aśvaghoṣa's "Fo Benxing Shi (佛本行詩, Buddha-conduct Poem)" is "lost in translation," which is probably the most appropriate.

<h3>Preface to "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden"</h3>
<p>— Wu Ling</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Hanrui brought me his manuscript of "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden" and asked me to write a few words. This is an obligation that cannot be refused.</p>
<p>I carefully read it from beginning to end. This manuscript has two hundred and twenty leaves, with six hundred characters on each half page. In total, the book has more than two hundred and fifty thousand words. The sources of the materials, that is, the books he has consulted and cited, are at least four hundred kinds, many of which are very obscure and rare. This kind of work is much more difficult than Zhang Cixi's compilation of "Historical Materials of the Liyuan Garden in Yandu during the Qing Dynasty" and Zhou Mingtai's hand-copied and printed "Excerpts from the Files of the Qing Shengping Bureau"; because "Historical Materials of the Liyuan Garden in Yandu during the Qing Dynasty" is just a collection of books, and "Excerpts from the Files of the Qing Shengping Bureau" is just a transcription of materials. Although this "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden" is the same as the two books mentioned above, it is so-called burning bricks and tiles rather than building houses, but it requires the most calm patience, the longest time, the most extensive knowledge and the most intelligent choice. I personally have some experience in compiling a catalog of dramas. I often spend many days checking a book, but in the end I can't find a single entry. Sometimes I find it but I can't determine and identify it. This is just like the gold miners on the banks of the Jinsha River, only they truly understand the hardships. Mr. Zhang Hanrui has cited at least four hundred kinds of books in this book, but he may have searched more than a thousand kinds. I say this, and he will definitely understand it well. In fact, gold is transferred from the hands of gold miners to gold shops, and after thousands of hammers and refinements, it adds various solemnity to women. The books made with such great effort are only available to scholars and experts as ready-made materials, allowing them to decorate the feathers of magnificent books. So, why not write it directly yourself? This is why we will always express our gratitude for Mr. Zhang Hanrui's attitude towards work. The more people who devote themselves to cultivation without asking for harvest, and the more people who specialize in learning for others without being selfish or arrogant, the more the future of learning can be envisioned as bright. At the same time, our emphasis on this book also has obvious differences from other similar works. In terms of time, the materials it contains cannot be limited by a certain period or dynasty, but from ancient times to modern times. In terms of space, the scope it determines is not only the dramas of Yongjia and the Zaju of Dadu, but also the materials of the local operas with rich regional characteristics that can be sorted out and outlined as much as possible. The word "Pear Garden" is used in a broad sense: music, dance, songs, and dramas are all counted; in terms of drama, it not only includes the titles of scripts and writers, and the textual research of the content of the works, but also focuses on stage performances and the records of the private lives of actors, which is more obvious than the quhua of the predecessors, and is more serious than the Juju, which specializes in making daily life notes for actors. Jumping out of Wang Guowei's "Yuyulu" and Ren Na's "Xinquyuan" circles, scholars who study folk literature and devote themselves to different directions can choose and use according to their special needs, saving the waste of time searching for books unreasonably.</p>
<p>As for the reason why this book is called "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden", it is because Mr. Zhang Hanrui arranges the materials in the same way as Liu Yiqing's Shishuo Xinyu. It is divided into sixty-three topics in total, that is, Kaoji, Bianzheng, Jiahua, Jiqi, Qianyou, Wunong, Douou, Panduan, Shihuan, Shangmai, Aidao, Xiaoxie, Xuanba, Shifang, Gushi, Jiuzhang, Yanhui, Shangci, Jinge, Tanhe, Chuanshu, Zhengyin, Libie, Tizeng, Huixie, Jidu, Youxi, Huoni, Shoukao, Xiongwang, Zaihuo, Beipan, Zhengdiao, Juanshu, Guishen, Yaonie, Bushu, Jizai, Yilun, Duiou, Yinglian, Dengmi, Zalu, Yutan, Ciqu, , Quanjie, Shihao, Caihua, Jiyi, Chanyue, Jianzheng, Jifeng, Mifeng, Jiamao, Chichai, Zhazhuan, Xiushi, Jiedong, Pinping, Lingru, Ganpao, Jinxu. Similar materials are attached under each topic. Mr. Zhang Hanrui's classification is quite careful, so there is no fault in finding a material that appears in two places. However, what we demand for perfection is the classification method. This is not a question of old or new, but a question of whether it is convenient for others to use this book. This classification method seems to be just the editor's subjective impression of understanding the content of the material, without an objective standard as a measure. Hard determination, the theme can not be limited by numbers; saying it is classification is actually equivalent to ignoring it. A material can be attached to more than one similar topic at the same time; many materials of the same thing, the same person, and the same play are scattered and cannot be concentrated together. Readers who treat this book as entertainment after tea and wine will certainly not pick on this phenomenon. I think the editor must not estimate the contribution of this book so humbly. However, if readers want to use the advantages of this book, they will first encounter a powerful man-made obstacle. This book has already been compiled and it is practically impossible to reorganize it. I am willing to put forward a small opinion, which represents the wishes of most readers. It is best if Mr. Zhang Hanrui can add a proper noun index and a cited book title index when this book is published, on the one hand, to fill the gaps, and most importantly, this extremely hard work must receive the good results of fulfilling its responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Li Gou Did Not Like Mencius</h3>
<p>— Qi Xia</p>
<p>Does this mean that Li Gou's attitude towards Mencius was very contradictory? I think this is not entirely true. We should seek an answer from the process of Li's ideological development.</p>
<p>In Li Gou's youth and middle age, although he was somewhat dissatisfied with Mencius, he still recognized the position he had already gained among the scholar-officials. Therefore, when he wrote a letter to Sun Sicheng at the age of twenty-three, he still listed Mencius as one of the saints, and when he wrote "Li Lun" at the age of twenty-four, he raised objections to Mencius's theory of the goodness of human nature. In "Pingtu Shu", which he wrote at the age of twenty-eight, he was quite displeased with Mencius's saying that "the Zhou people taxed with one-tenth on a hundred mu", but in "Zhou Li Zhi Taiping Lun", which he wrote at the age of thirty-five, he quoted many of Mencius's words as the basis for his argument. It can be seen that at these times, although Li Gou criticized Mencius, he also absorbed Mencius, and would not adopt a completely opposed attitude towards Mencius, and naturally he was not yet known to the world for opposing Mencius. Therefore, when Zu Wuzhe wrote a preface to Li Gou's collection of essays in the winter of the third year of Qingli (Li was thirty-five), he compared Li Gou to Mencius, saying "Li Taibo of Xujiang has the deep heart of Mencius and the six gentlemen." And in the first year of Huangyou (Li was forty-one), when Fan Zhongyan recommended Li Gou to the court, he also said in his memorial that "Li Gou's writing books and establishing words have the style and meaning of Mencius and Yang Xiong." If Li Gou had already completely denied Mencius at this time, and the society had already known that Li Gou was the most forceful person against Mencius, wouldn't Zu Wuzhe and Fan Zhongyan's words all become a kind of satire to Li Gou?</p>
<p>The most severe words of Li Gou's opposition to Mencius are all in his "Chang Yu", and "Chang Yu" was written in the year when he was forty-five years old. It was probably after he was forty years old that his tendency to oppose Mencius became more and more intense, and he tried his best to vent it in the book "Chang Yu". During this period, when Li Gou talked to people on a daily basis, he inevitably vilified Mencius to his heart's content, so it was passed on from person to person, and Li Gou became famous in the world as a "Mencius expert".</p>

<h3>Respectfully Request Rationing of Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that the Social Affairs Bureau had a plan to increase the types of rations, and also established a Research Association on the Compilation of Living Index. As the name suggests, it shows that the compilation of the living index has become quite a "problem". The association has been "researching" for the past few days. I don't know what results have been "researched" out yet, but it seems that we will have to wait until the end of the month to publish the index before we can fully appreciate the weight of the "research" of these gentlemen. But one thing seems to be beyond doubt: the Social Affairs Bureau believes that if it can ration eight kinds of rations, including cloth (including plain cloth and colored cloth), table salt, soy sauce, firewood, matches, socks, cigarettes, and soap, it can "stabilize" the living index.</p>
<p>Originally, in the late spring of April, the wind is warm and the sun is shining. It would be inappropriate to say "freeze" again. The word "stabilize" is seen to be appropriate and beautiful, suitable for all seasons. It should be taken out and praised. I will not mention it here.</p>
<p>However, in the newspaper the next day, I saw the news that the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions did not recognize the "Research Association on the Compilation of Living Index". According to the spokesperson of the Federation of Trade Unions: the Federation of Trade Unions was not invited to attend the research association, and said, "If the results produced by the activities of the association have any impact on the living index, the workers have no obligation to accept it. If the necessities of life are rationed, the Federation of Trade Unions welcomes it very much." (April 14 this newspaper)</p>
<p>Of course, the most directly affected by any new decisions on the living index are the workers throughout Shanghai. It is indeed no wonder that the Federation of Trade Unions has a sense of vigilance for "researching" such a "problem" without inviting members of the Federation of Trade Unions to attend.</p>
<p>However, rationing the necessities of life is indeed a very good thing, and if the living index can be stabilized by the stability of prices, it is of course what all our citizens sincerely desire. The question is, can prices be stabilized after rationing these cloth, salt, oil, firewood, matches, socks, cigarettes, and soap?</p>
<p>This is an important question. If what we are seeking is real stability, then we should "research" this question with our conscience.</p>
<p>Since we want to "research" how to stabilize prices, why not first look at how prices have risen? Let's look at the newspapers three days before the establishment of the "Research Association on the Compilation of Living Index", and we don't need to quote the numbers in detail, so as to avoid the criticism of filling the number of words to cheat the manuscript fee. We only look at the headline of the Shanghai edition of this newspaper that day (April 10):</p>
<p>New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone</p>
<p>Consultations and Approval Implemented Yesterday</p>
<p>Telephone Increased by More Than One Fold to 65 to 70</p>
<p>Strong Reaction Prices Rose in the Afternoon</p>
<p>What a "strong reaction, prices rose in the afternoon", it is really "the magic is tested on the spot"! Have we ever seen news in the newspaper that day saying "Food and Matches Prices Rose, Strong Reaction, Prices Rose in the Afternoon"?</p>
<p>Stabilizing prices is good; stabilizing the living index is also good. We have repeatedly respectfully read the policy reports of the two directors of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau at the Municipal Council and their replies to the inquiries of the councilors. We deeply believe that these two are good officials and honest officials who are concerned about the suffering of the people. We citizens now only want to ask the upright old masters to show mercy and see if we can ration water and electricity at a flat price, just like the rationing of rice!</p>
<p>Otherwise, when presenting the banner of ten thousand people, we have to add a small parenthesis under the four golden characters of "Vanguard for the People", and inside the parenthesis are the two words "Price Increase" written in the blood and sweat of all the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Double-Headed Monstrosity</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Last year, a double-headed monstrosity appeared in Shanghai, exploiting its physical deformity to earn a sum of money. Sadly, this little life soon withered, and it never enjoyed anything beyond being a "spectacle." Similar double-headed monstrosities are not entirely unprecedented, but it is truly rare for them to grow into adulthood. Among these rare cases, the American double-headed woman Millie-Christine is a remarkable example.</p>
<p>Millie-Christine was born in Columbus County, North Carolina, in 1851. Her parents were a pair of black slaves. From the moment of her birth, she was taken from the black people's hut to the mansion of her parents' master, Joseph Smith. Smith, as if he had obtained a treasure, took great care of her. When she grew to fifteen months old, Smith took her on a tour of the entire United States.</p>
<p>Doctors and scientists examined Millie-Christine, and they all called her a contemporary monster. She had two heads, two shoulders, four arms, four legs, two lungs, and two hearts, but only one body.</p>
<p>Because she was almost like two people glued together, her master gave each body a separate name: one was called Millie, and the other was called Christine. Millie and Christine's main hobbies and habits were the same. "They" both loved music, dancing, and other entertainment. However, their opinions were not entirely consistent, and the two heads often engaged in heated debates over certain matters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Millie and Christine were never lonely or isolated. Their arguments or differences of opinion never became severe enough to disrupt their pleasant and comfortable shared life.</p>
<p>Millie's voice was mezzo-soprano, while Christine sang soprano. According to music critics at the time, their joint singing was exceptionally sweet and moving. Wherever they performed, residents of nearby towns emptied their streets to attend, demonstrating the widespread sensation they caused.</p>
<p>The "Cincinnati Enquirer" at the time humorously said of Millie-Christine: "She could be an excellent juror because she can see both sides at the same time."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Chen Shi Yi</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Lord Chen Shiyi (Yan), of Houguan, was renowned throughout the world for his poetry. In the late Qing Dynasty, he was the first to advocate emulating Song poetry, and he was the leader of the "Tongguang School." During the Guangxu era, he joined the staff of Zhang Zhidong. At that time, Zhidong was the governor-general of Huguang, and he was handling new policies. Expenses were enormous, and the public treasury was depleted. Lord Chen suggested minting copper coins to enrich the national treasury. Zhidong followed his advice, and prices rose as a result. Today, people only know that Zhidong created copper coins, but they do not know that the proposal actually originated from Lord Chen.</p>
<p>Lord Chen was deeply versed in classics and history, and he was particularly good at discussing poetry. He wrote "Shi Yi Shi Shi Hua" (Stone Remains Studio Poetry Talks), which was published by the Commercial Press. It was vast and profound, unprecedented. Poets of the time could become famous with just one word of praise from him. The sheer size of the work was also unprecedented in the history of poetry talks. Later, he completed a sequel, but the selection of material was somewhat indiscriminate, not as careful as the main volume. Critics often compared it to "Sui Yuan Shi Hua" (Sui Garden Poetry Talks), which is also a factual record.</p>
<p>Lord Chen looked like an old dragon in an autumn pool. He was old but still robust, walking as if flying, leaving young people far behind. After the age of eighty, he still took a plane to Sichuan to visit Mount Emei. Furthermore, he kept two young concubines, which was also a rare blessing from heaven.</p>
<p>In his later years, Lord Chen lived as a recluse in Suzhou, spending every day indulging in literary gatherings with people like Zhang Taiyan and Jin Songcen. Every week, he also went to Wuxi National Studies College to lecture for a day. When he arrived, he would drink and make merry with Tang Weizhi day and night, and he was never seen drunk.</p>
<p>Lord Chen was as famous as Chen Sanli and Zheng Xiaoxu. He compared Sanli to Huang Shangu, Xiaoxu to Chen Jianqi, and himself to Dongpo. Lord Chen even wrote a preface for Xiaoxu's "Hai Cang Lou Shi" (Sea Storage Building Poetry), which shows how deep their friendship was. After Xiaoxu joined the puppet state of Manchukuo, the Commercial Press reprinted "Shi Yi Shi Shi Hua," deleting references to Xiaoxu. Xiaoxu was greatly resentful. When Lord Chen died, he wrote an elegiac poem, saying, "What did Shiyi leave behind when he died?" The poem was filled with invective, revealing Xiaoxu's narrow-mindedness. This is why he was unable to judge his own conduct and lost the reputation he had earned in his early years. But Lord Chen never uttered a word criticizing Xiaoxu.</p>
<h3>About American Women</h3>
<p>— Shuo Fu</p>
<p>According to an article published by American writer Maxine Churchill in "The American Magazine," if an American woman's name is Mary, she is five feet five inches tall, weighs one hundred and twenty-three pounds, and has completed eight and a half years of schooling, then she is a typical American woman.</p>
<p>According to other statistics about American women, they live longer than men, but their marriage rate is lower than men's. Even before the war, on average, one in seven young women was "left on the shelf."</p>
<p>Currently, the number of women going to university is constantly increasing, and their chances of getting married are decreasing, because only one-third of female college graduates get married. However, their academic performance is no worse than that of their male classmates.</p>
<p>In general, assuming that a typical American woman can be found, she has the advantages of being healthy, wealthy, and intelligent.</p>
<h3>Ramblings on Funeral Couplets</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren</p>
<p>Ling Qihan of Hange Pavilion said that antithetical literature is a national treasure unique to Chinese writing, unmatched by any other country in the world, which is certainly a true statement. Antithetical writing is unique to China, and among antithetical writings, the funeral couplet is especially distinctive. It not only expresses grief for the deceased but also encapsulates the deceased's life and career, expressing it in just a few words. No other country has this kind of literature.</p>
<p>The simplest and most forceful funeral couplets have only fourteen characters, such as the funeral couplet written by Ling Xiaohan of Hange Pavilion for Zeng Wenzheng: "His life was marked by friendship and mentorship; his spirit soared into the heavens like a feather." This is an example of fourteen characters. Most of these funeral couplets are collections of existing phrases from ancient texts. I once saw a friend who was addicted to Go write a funeral couplet for a friend who often played against him: "The scenery of Jiangnan is truly beautiful; I hear that Chang'an is like a Go board." My friend happened to have died after traveling from Suzhou to Beiping, which was also quite fitting. I wrote a funeral couplet for Xu Shuzheng: "His reputation shone brightly but he was ultimately resented; his writings are hidden in the mountains and will surely not be erased." Although I followed this example, I was unable to collect existing phrases.</p>
<p>The words in a funeral couplet do not need to be too many, nor do they need to be beautifully written. What matters is that they are lively and vivid, capable of capturing a meaning beyond the surface. Fan Kentang wrote a funeral couplet for Taoist Pan: "He once traveled with me, a solitary crane and a lonely boat, a thousand layers of sorrow on the river; now this person is gone, a single chicken and a jug of wine, a few lines of clear tears in Licheng South." Taoist Pan was a disciple of Fan, and this couplet is extremely natural and vivid.</p>
<p>Even when political views differ, suspicion disappears after death. Yang Xizi wrote a funeral couplet for Huang Keqiang: "Public duty did not forget private friendship; throughout life, political views diverged, but the liver and gall still pushed at friendship. One man could defeat ten thousand; alas, heroic talent was without destiny; life and death have always trapped heroes." Yang Xizi was a leading figure in the Hongxian Chounan Association, strongly opposed to the republic, which is not commendable, but this couplet is indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>Funeral couplets for actors often contain many emotions, such as the one written by Wang Zeshan for Cheng Changgeng: "A farmer, how could I be wrong? The music back then, I will never forget Cui Jiu's hall, in the residence of Prince Qi. Guangling is dispersed and gone forever, where are the old travels? Let's not talk about the Zhenyuan courtiers, the Tianbao palace people." It is not only well-crafted and naturally matched, but also evokes infinite emotions. Another person wrote a funeral couplet for Tan Xiaotian: "What time is this? How can there be peaceful elegance? You have returned, it is good, you should be an enshrined immortal." At that time, Tan was called the old enshrined, and the last sentence perfectly fits Tan's status. When Yi Zhi died in the early spring of that year, someone also said: "His voice and appearance were extremely rare in the world, now there is no one in the South Palace, and it is also a time of desolation; the tears of the Canghai fall, Guangling is forever gone, let's not mention the Tianbin of that year." It is also a fitting tribute.</p>
<p>Pan Yu Shen Taimou was proficient in all kinds of learning. He wrote "Nanya Yitang Ye Shu," and was a strong member of the Southern Society. He and I and Ling Xiaohan corresponded frequently, and the letters piled up to inches thick. Later, when Shen returned to the mountains, Ling Xiao, who was good at writing couplets, did not write one, so I reluctantly wrote a couplet for him: "In old age, I carelessly filled out lyrics, weaving white hair and clear sorrow, a volume of heavy frost sadly dotted my temples; waking up, it's all a dream, washing away my green shirt and weeping tears, ten years of old rain made me swallow my voice." Since wreaths became popular, funeral couplets are not commonly used, and writers have gradually decreased. In the future, this tune may end up becoming Guangling San.</p>
<h3>"A Meager Gift"</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, after Shi Kefa was martyred, the Qing army advanced directly to Nanjing. Civil and military officials such as Wang Duo and Qian Qianyi came out of the city and knelt to welcome them, each offering heavy gifts to seek surrender.</p>
<p>It is said that Qian Qianyi's gift was the most "meager." The gift list was as follows: "A set of gold and silver utensils with flowing gold, and a set of cloisonné silver; a coiled dragon jade cup, a Song-made jade cup, a Tianlu rhinoceros cup, a sunflower rhinoceros cup, a hibiscus rhinoceros cup, and a cloisonné tripod cup; a pair of cloisonné crane cups and silver-inlaid crane cups; Xuan De palace fans, thirty pure gold fans, Yiyang gold fans, Geqi gold fans, a hundred sons palace fans, and ten pure gold Hangzhou fans; ten pure gold Suzhou fans, and ten pairs of silver-inlaid ivory chopsticks."</p>
<h3>Wandering Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Wandering at Sea</p>
<p>Xiao Bai said: "That's right, it's a pity I didn't bring it. I can tell you the general idea of ​​the letter. She said that she has been very popular in all aspects since she arrived in Shanghai. Now, there are some people who want to choose a Peking Opera queen. It's likely that she has a good chance to win the Queen's throne. This is a glory for her. Secondly, Dr. Mei has accepted her as a disciple, personally teaching her the plays and vigorously promoting her. She feels that the future is very promising, which is most comforting to her. There is also one of the most peculiar things. Recently, a certain top figure wants to meet her and talk about art and life. She pays close attention to this point and considers it a rare opportunity to boast to her peers in the future. The three things, in the lines of the letter, are all very excited and proud. What she is feeling distressed about now is that many wealthy bosses are pestering her, and there are many people she doesn't want to get close to, but for the sake of the scene, she has to. According to her letter, from the time she gets up to the time she goes to the theater, there are always guests coming to find her. Every day, she wants to eat a quiet meal at home, but she doesn't have the time. She is always invited out for tea dances or evening parties. These occasions are all important and cannot be offended, so she is mentally exhausted every day. In addition, the Shanghai theaters require almost all the big stars to perform double bills, making her dizzy all day long, unaware of the world. She also said in her letter that if she sees you, she will advise you to work hard for your future. She is doing well in Shanghai and intends to have fun for a while before deciding what to do. Look at how a girl can pick herself up and let things go. She has recovered after suffering such a serious blow, and she has re-established her career in Shanghai. You are still depressed and can't see through everything, which is not as good as her. From now on, you have to put everything aside, cheer up, and strive forward. Don't worry about a girlfriend anymore." Zhu Zhai said: "I think the letter she wrote to my father was also very depressed and not optimistic." Xiao Bai said: "You silly boy, she wrote to your father and me. If she told your father the truth, what value would this person have in your father's eyes? She was able to create her current status. Wasn't it your father who successfully stimulated her? If she told your father how proud she was to go to Shanghai, in your father's eyes, this kind of flighty woman was fortunate to have been sent away first, otherwise this kind of person would come to the house and become a disaster. She complains about her depression and suffering, which is precisely her cleverness. Don't be deceived by her. She is making a name for herself in Shanghai, enjoying herself, but you are frowning all day, thinking about her, which is too foolish and silly. Young people are all emotional and easily go astray. In the future, no matter what you do, you must judge it rationally, so that you will not suffer yourself." 18</p>
<h3>Painting Inscriptions from the Sword Studio</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongtao</p>
<p>Inscription on a Painting of Listening to Rain by a Banana Window</p>
<p>Raindrops fall high and low like ten thousand crossbows,</p>
<p>The banana trees interpret it as a fluttering dance;</p>
<p>Sparse lattice lets the wind enter, a lamp flickers,</p>
<p>Dreaming of hearing reeds and spring geese in the lake;</p>
<p>Wine is cold, fragrance is gone, the dream returns to wakefulness,</p>
<p>The shadows of the lake and river are too fragmented;</p>
<p>Unable to sleep, I love counting the night watch,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, apricot blossoms will surely fill the lane.</p>
<p>Inscription on a Painting of Talking Poetry in a River Pavilion</p>
<p>This path is difficult to grasp, there is no second door,</p>
<p>What can be said is only stepping over the fence.</p>
<p>Sometimes one forgets words when content,</p>
<p>But listens to the river's sound, freely clamoring.</p>
<h3>Lei Hui</h3>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Shanghai produced several "biographical" novels: "Officialdom Unmasked," "The Travels of Lao Can," and "Flower in a Sinful Sea." Each realistically depicted aspects of politics and society, so they can be considered "biographical works." Qing Dynasty novels were numerous but of varying quality. Those of the highest quality could represent the literature of an era. "Dream of the Red Chamber" was profound, magnificent, and unparalleled. "The Scholars," "Gallant Maid and Knight," "Outlaws of the Marsh," and various chivalrous detective stories were also worth reading. The aforementioned works of the late Qing Dynasty served as the rearguard, adding glory to the genre.</p>
<p>A so-called "biographical work" should not only be interesting to read at the time but also have lasting value for repeated reading and contemplation. After publication, it should not rely on promotion but be considered worth reading at any time and kept on the desk. This is a successful work. During the Qing Dynasty, all industries were in decline, society was fixed, and politics and people's lives, the gains and losses of the times, were "controlled by the hands of officials." Officials who rose through the imperial examination system were considered the orthodox path, and the public admired only becoming an official and passing the imperial examinations. Thus, "Flower in a Sinful Sea," which depicted the affairs of officials in the capital and members of the Hanlin Academy, was a notable work. (The author of "Flower in a Sinful Sea," Zeng Jun, was the son-in-law of Wang Liu Men. Wang was a Hanlin scholar in the Yichou year, repeatedly in charge of literary exams, and a veteran of the literary world, so his son-in-law was also able to speak and write well. The book still has errors and amateurish language, which a certain magazine published in Shanghai four years ago listed. However, such minor flaws cannot obscure its overall value because few novels depict the scenery of the capital's officialdom.)</p>
<p>In the era of the imperial examination, a scholar's life was centered on exams, progressing from a child student to a student, from a student to a Jiasheng, a licentiate, and from a licentiate to a metropolitan graduate, without missing any level. Even after becoming a metropolitan graduate and entering the Hanlin Academy, known as the pure and noble class, one would be sent out as the chief examiner of a provincial or educational exam to examine others. However, before going on such assignments, one had to pass the "exam for assignments." Furthermore, the Hanlin Academy had a grand exam, in which the best were promoted and the worst were demoted and punished. Thus, there is a poem: "Golden-topped hat, court beads, purple sable coat, immortals rejoice together on a sunny day; upon hearing of the grand exam, their souls all fall, even retiring immortals are not spared." The feeling of "Hanlin scholars fearing the grand exam" is the same as that of "scholars fearing the annual exam." The exams depicted in "Flower in a Sinful Sea" are a class of exams that transcend the imperial examination.</p>
<p>Among the imperial examinations, the provincial and metropolitan exams were the most important. "Gallant Maid and Knight" is considered the best at depicting them in detail. Its depiction of An Gongzi's provincial exam, from entering the exam compound to the posting of the results and the announcement of the congratulations, everything is described in detail, vividly depicting the mood of the examiners and the candidates. This scene of the main examination hall, which occupied more than a thousand years of old cultural history, will truly remain in people's minds, and its historical value is unmatched by anything else. (If "Flower in a Sinful Sea" had such detail, then its description of the various exams of the Hanlin Academy would be even more remarkable.) This kind of realistic value far exceeds that of party-related notes because notes can only record events, not convey spirit and depict scenes, so that readers feel as if they are there. The author, Wen Kang, was a licentiate, so his writing is most accurate when describing the licentiate's examination. Because he was not a metropolitan graduate and did not preside over literary examinations, the sequence of the palace examination and the triennial examination, and the distinction between seat numbers and roll numbers, were all pointed out as mistaken by Xun. Dong Lao asked to comment on this book, "the owner of my studio." He was from Yangzhou, a metropolitan graduate in the Gengzi year of Daoguang, and rose to the position of Minister of Revenue. He was the chief examiner of the provincial examinations in the Wuchen year of Tongzhi and the Bingzi year of Guangxu, and various literary assignments, so he was familiar with everything.) However, even these few sections on the provincial exam are an unparalleled success, which cannot be written by other books or others. The scene in the metropolitan examination hall is roughly the same as that in the provincial exam, so the meetings of An Laoye and An Gongzi in the exam compound are briefly described. The "old scholar" is called "small exam," which is the first step to fame for scholars, and the academy presides over it. "The Scholars" and "A Marriage to Awaken the World; or, A Story to Make Men Wise" and "Marvelous Views of Times Past and Present" all have depictions of it that can be used as a model.</p>
