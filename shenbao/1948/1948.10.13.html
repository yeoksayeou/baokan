<h3>立院臨時改開秘密會議　聽取美援運用報告　增幣停防搶購兩案付審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕立法院第二會期第十次會議，十二日舉行，惟開會前到會旁聽之新聞記者突遭警衛會塲之憲兵嚴辭拒絕入內，記者等以議事日程及開會通知中均未說明係秘密會議，乃向新聞室交涉，據稱：由於政院及立院程序委會之考慮，因美援運用及分配事項中未決問題甚多，如予公布，可能影饗貸款，故決定改開秘密會議，一俟美援問題報吿質詢答覆完畢後，卽開始公開會議。記者等無奈，祗得麕集樓廳休息室中等待，迨至十一時許休息時間届臨，登樓休息之委員晤見記者後，紛詢何不至會塲内採訪，及聞係開秘密會議，皆各訝然不知。據各委員談，列席會議之政府人員有行政院長兼美援運用委員會主委翁文灝，委員兼聯絡專員嚴家淦，秘書長沈熙瑞及外次代理部務劉師舜等，首由翁氏報吿美援沿革，繼卽由嚴氏列舉數字報吿自本年四月迄今美援運用分配之詳細情况，什九均係報端已發表之舊賬。令人聞之倦乏。報告之末，食塲中已閑談嗡嗡然，至此，記者等以會議内容旣毫無秘密必要，且更改議程於例會中改開秘密會一節，亦未依法經委員動議或由院長提出徵詢同意，顯屬違法，乃逕訪秘書長張肇元氏，質問理由並表示抗議。張氏首卽吿以報吿内容已商得翁院長同意將全部發表，至開秘密會一節，乃政院意見，與立院協議決定者，記者等仍以旣然報吿可全部公開，何故改開秘密會議，請張氏轉詢翁院長答覆。旋經翁院長與孫院長會商後，決恢復公開會議，張氏並於以此訊答記者時稱，渠本人亦最反對秘密會議，卽孫院長於開會時亦曾訝然相詢何故改開秘密會議，言下頗有維谷之意，頻向記者等致歉。記者等以目的已達，向張氏道擾後，卽進入會塲工作，自十一時半至十二時十分提出書面或口頭質詢者約十餘人，多集中注意於各地區分配之公允及季節性運用之效率兩點，量後經翁院長請以書面答覆後散會。午後三時半續開例會，仍由孫院長生席，議程所列報吿事項，已於晨間秘密會中處理完畢，乃開始進行討論事項，第一案爲沈　宇等提議補充穩定金圓價値辦法『以增强幣制之信用，而利施行案（内容要點見八日本報）。發言委員十餘人，對該案原則均表贊同，然或有於某數細節持修正及保留意見者，綜其要旨約爲：（一）提案辦法之（乙）項「增加生產』部份過於簡略，應予充實，並强調之。（二）爲平抑物價，維持幣信，應打老虎，借人頭。（三）金圓券發行監理委會無擴大之必要。（四）財政全部公開，並確定以發行公債，强制富戶認購辦法，彌補赤字預算，避免通貨膨脹，以安人心。（五）金圓券為管理本位，並採十足準備制，故發行準備基金不應動用。（六）銀質輔幣之兌換價格，必遠低於其所含純銀之金屬價格，故無停止其發行一之必要。此案討論達兩小時，最後無異議通過，交付財金及經資兩委會會同審査。第二案爲劉士篤等提議防止搶購，激勵生產，疏導游資，促進國民就業，以充裕物產，穩定物價，而宏經濟改革實效案，經提案人說明後，若干委員聯名提出書面意見，以爲提案所涉範圍過廣，所擬辦法亦僅爲空洞之原則，主張加以保留。然經提案人再度解釋後，表決結果，仍得交付財金及經資兩委會會同審査，至下午六時一刻散會，未及討論之經濟合理化法案等案，排入下次例會議程。</p>

<h3>中國科學家與國家建設　——祝十科學團體聯合年會成功能——</h3>
<p>中國科學社等十科學團體，在首都與北平，分別舉行聯合年會三天，前天已圓滿閉幕。廣州成都二地，接着還將舉行分區的年會。這與半月前舉行的中央硏究院院士會，同是國家學術上的盛會。際此世局俶擾國事動亂之中，薈萃全國專家的才智，從事科學建國的硏討，科學家那種篤學愛國與鎭靜眞摯的精神，眞令人不勝佩慕之忱。我們於欣讀會議新聞之餘，謹於此祝此次聯合年會的成功，並期待今後中國科學更多與建國事業密切配合的進步。</p>
<p>我國之有現代科學的研究，實際上始自民國紀元以後。中國科學社成立於民國三年，國父以科學建設中國的大方案——實業計劃，是始定於民國九十年間。「迎頭趕上」的寳訓，與學者集力的倡導，可說是向着共同一致的目標。可惜社會的惰力與外患的阻撓，廿餘年中科學的進步多阻，以致抗戰發生，犧牲慘重，戰後共亂繼作，使歷刧待蘇的科學工業還繼續遭受阻力。這樣現實的敎訓太嚴重了，中國科學家今後的使命，無疑地應更多更有效的貢獻於國家建設的事業。</p>
<p>自然科學的太質，原是涵有國際性，所以我們常聽到「科學無國界」一類的話；可是從現代科學研究的實際和效用來看，科學是斷然兼具國家性的；科學必先有造於國家建設與人民福利，然後乃能進而有造於全人類的幸福。中國是一們大國，但又是科學落後的弱國。我們今日不但痛定思痛，大家要澈悟國防科學爲現代獨立國家自衛上的絕對必要，並且借鑑並世各國科學與政治密切合作的事例，更不能不動員全國有數的科學家，向着國家建設的大目標來努力。</p>
<p>此次科學團體年會開幕之日，名譽會長翁文灝氏致詞，曾籲請全國科學家與政府合作，以推動社會的進眇。而蔣總統在中央硏究院院士會集會中，已鄭重期望全國科學家「爲國家建設致其力」。他認爲要建設現代化的中國，「卽爲建設科學的中國」。此一宣示，實際已指出了今後政治與科學密切合作的眞確途徑。政府今後必須以最大力量獎進科學的研究，而我們所懇切期望於全國科學家致力於國家建設者，要有三點</p>
<p>第一是以科學專粉的硏究配合建國的計劃：科學硏究自當本末兼賅，尤不可以應用科學而忽視純理科學的研究。但另一方面學者必須注意國家當前的需要，顧到國家建設的計劃，定其緩急輕重，從事分門專精的硏，以備爲國用。譬如爲實現實業計劃而擬訂的經濟建設分年計劇，則計劃內所要實現與科學息息相關的技術建設，就需要各部門的科學專家，並委託他們計劃訓練，幹部或技術人員，來共同努力，庶幾不託空言。重要國營工業，以及輕便的民用工業，無一不要無數科學家工程家來研究股計，至於國防工程的建設，更需要高度的研究工作，期待無數部門科學家高度的貢獻。總統在戰時所提示「建國必須達到國防絕對安全」的呼召，和所謂「沒有科學就沒有國防，沒有國防就沒有國家」的警語，在國際形勢緊張的今日，是更値得我們科學家深切體會和力行的，（下接第五版）</p>
<h3>洩露改幣機密案　京地院開庭審訊　徐陶兩被告均推卸責任</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕陶啓明，徐百齊洩露改幣機密案，十二日由京地院刑庭庭長徐邦治在黑暗之大法庭上張燈審訊，監委趙熙，陳慶華，秘書朱炳麟均到庭聽審。地院院長汪兆彭，首撿陳先虞亦親自出席旁觀，被吿徐百齊，陶啓明所請之辯護律師鄧子駿，蔣海溶，季蘇，王健等應傳到庭，上午九時五分開庭，訊問被吿陶啓明，至十一時十分退庭，下午二時繼續開庭，審訊被吿徐百齊，至三時三刻庭。訊問重點在徐百齊如何向陶啓明供給機密消息，陶如何飛滬，囑其妻李國蘭拋售永紗股票，兩被吿對此重心均互相似吻合非吻合的推卸責任。徐百齊否認故意對陶啓明洩漏消息，共商牟利，陶啓明則推其妻經營股票爲常事，並非由其授意後始行拋售，而渠本人根本不知改幣消息。陶應訊時着綢質夾袍，單褲，態度故作鎭靜，並作回憶思索狀，法官對其家庭狀况及入學作事之情形訊問至詳，陶答覆時稱：渠本人雖入財部工作，王雲五財長則無關係。法官問陶，徐百齊何時透露消息，陶稱：渠於找徐請假後，徐卽謂你去好了，徐並說出奉命擬具全國銀行，錢莊停業文稿，但只有月份，而無日期，「當時我們很奇怪這是什麼意思，會發生怎樣的後果，後來他說你到上海去，可以問問袁仰安」。法官追問：「徐百齊旣不知是何用意，覺得奇怪，爲什麽呌你到上海去問袁仰安，去問這樣一個無關的人，不是奇怪嗎？難道徐百齊眞的沒有用意嗎」？陶謂，徐並無用意，渠並否認徐與之商量做股票事。對於當時何以乘飛機赴滬事，陶謂：係圖省錢，抵滬後卽往訪袁仰安，將全國行莊停業之說吿知袁，陶稱：袁表示這事大不可能，並問徐百齊要你我做些什麽呢？我就對袁說：「他也沒有說要我們做什麼」，說話約十幾分鐘卽返。翌晨，陶尙未起床，其妻卽外出經營股票，陶稱：渠未命其妻作股票，其本人亦未做股票，其妻係經常經營股票，至李伯勤等渠均不知。法官乃以陶在刑警隊時之口供斥之，陶稱：　那時幾天沒有休息，實在疲勞不堪。迎我自己也不曉得我說了些什麽話」。最後，陶請庭上調查四點：（一）八月十八係先與徐百齊碰頭，請似以後，才談到他擬全國行載停業命令，而　先知後　　。（二）絕未令其妻做股票或吿知消息。（三）絕無與袁仰安商經營　　　。　改　消息　全不知，法　　　間陶何時獲知改幣消息，陶　：係十九日晚十一時　　回　時，在車站　香烟店所云，　　　　，上午　　　　　　　　　袁仰安　　沒　　息，這不可能。　此，時已十一時廿分，　官乃宣布退庭。</p>
<p>下午二時繼續　訊徐百齊，徐狀頗緊張，並因天　，時作畏縮狀，訊問年藉後，法官卽詢其家庭狀況及與王雲五相識經過，徐稱：「與王雲五相識，係在中央研究院，後在商務印書館共事約二十年，並隨王部長到經濟部，行政院及財政部工作，徐承認介紹陶啓明入財部工作，但並無深將，八月十八日約十二時半，徐次長命擬代電三則，其中一為全國行莊停業三天，當時不知改幣消息，辦稿後下樓遇陶啓明，渠擬赴滬，因吿以奉命擬全國行莊停業三天電稿，不知何故，故命陶到滬後詢問袁仰安，因袁頗有學問也，並無其他用意，後來始知錯了」。法官卽詰問：「爲何財政部的機密命令你諉稱不知，而呌陶去問袁仰安一個不相千的人，這倒是奇怪了，眞奇怪「。徐稱：「那時因爲太忙，無暇與陶談心，所以這樣呌他走的，但陶何時赴滬，乘火車抑乘飛機，均不知道』。徐並稱：「刑警隊的供詞未能記下我的意思，而且那時被疲勞審訊得神經錯亂，沒有身歷其境的，實在不知道那種痛苦，我的確是個好人，請庭上爲我設想，我如果想牟利，何必呌陶啓明去，上海我的熟人也很多，爲什麼一定要吿訴他，希望庭上能聽我的話，我的話是很誠懇的」。法官問徐是否知陶做股票，徐稱：「報上刊出隱名士消息，我與陶閑談，說你也到上海的呀，陶說我沒有做股票，不過我太太是賣了兩百萬股的，這時我對他的印象就不好了，直到他被捕起來，刑警隊請我承認與陶啓明商量做股票，到上海將消一息吿知袁仰安，那記錄是不正確的」。至是，兩被吿對洩露消息案均推諉凈盡，下午三時三刻，此調査庭乃宣吿結束，並諭知候示期再審，退庭後，徐百齊之女交絨衣一件與徐，並對徐說：「要保重身體」，卽含淚而去。</p>

<h3>商業銀行調整資本辦法　財部釋明條文疑問</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕商營銀行調整資本辦法公布後，關於條文之解釋，各行莊曾紛紛向財部詢問。財部爲釋明條文中若千疑問起見，頃已擬訂「「商營銀行調整資本辦法」解釋」一極，於十二日公布·（原條文刊九月五日本報第一版，請査閱）全文如下：商營銀行調整資本辦法解釋第一條及第二條解釋從略。</p>
<p>第三條解釋：（一）各地行莊最低炎本額在同一縣區內（不論其行址設在縣城或設在鄕鎭）應一體適用。（二）信託公司附設銀行部者，其資本額應照銀行附設信託部辦理。（三）在同一市區或縣區設立分支機構超過一個以上者，其超過之分支機構，不必比照十分之一之規定增加資本。（四）銀行之分支行處附設信託部或儲蓄部，其營運資金由總行信託部或儲蓄部劃撥者，得不另增加資本。</p>
<p>第四條解釋：（一）因加工改良或改造修理而增加資產之原有價値或效用者，其支出之費用如原已列入營業用器具或營業用房地產等資產科目時，得重估價格併入該項資產升値項目計算？如已列入損益科目時，不得計算在內。（二）資產升値後如有餘額，其超過應增資本之半數部份，得提充公積金但不得分配。</p>
<p>第五條解釋：（一）本條所稱「應增資本總額」指經股東會議決所擬定之新資本額，此項新資本額得超過但不得少於最低規定標準，如經股東會之決議僅增達最低標準者，則此「應增資太總額」卽指應增最低資本額，如經股東會之決議增資超過規定標準者，則指其股東決議應增達之數。額例如：經股東決議資本增達至二百萬金圓。一·如原有資產升値至一百萬金圓，則尙應由股東增繳現金一百萬金圓。二·如原有資產升値爲三十萬金圓，則尙應由股東增繳現金一百七十萬金圓。三·如原有資產升値至一百二十萬金圓，則仍應由股東增繳現金一百萬金圓，多餘之二十萬金圓得移充公積金，但不得分配。（二）股東不得以財產抵充現金繳納應增股款。（三）新增現金資本自各該行莊繳存中央銀行之日起，滿三個月發還。未設有中央銀行地方資金之繳存，另由部商洽中央銀行辦理之。（四）資產升値如尙朱達應增資本額之半數時，其補足半數之現金增資部份，亦應存入中央銀行。（五）行莊調整資產超過標準資本額，其溢出部份並合於增設分支行處應增資本，將來在此範圍内添設分支行處，經依規定核准後，得不另增資本。（下接第四版）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十二日廣播：美·英·法三國十二日對解除柏林封鎖事，已放棄與蘇聯覓求妥協之一切企圖，開始促速安理會對柏林問題採取行動。此事適與美國務卿馬歇爾在華府與杜魯門總統談話完畢飛返巴黎同事發生。西方三强對入中立國之調解努力已吿失望，刻正草擬以堅決行動解除柏林封鎖之決議案。馬氏甫抵巴黎，尙未在聯大會塲露面，似仍為美政策之幕後策動者。安理會主席阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞業巳放棄其謀求妥恊之一切希望，開始覓取解決柏林危機之方案。安理會在一週休會以後，可望於十三日舉行正式會議，屆時西方列强將就三點控訴蘇聯：（一）在安理會中，指控封鎖柏林威脅世界和平。雖明知蘇聯必然使用否決權，但仍將堅持在安理會中控訴蘇聯。（二）在聯大會中，英國巳率先指責蘇聯使舉世杌隉，蘇聯所提在三年內裁减軍備三分之一無誠意。（三）在聯大會中，西方圖以壓倒多數，通過美國原子能管制計劃，藉以指控蘇聯為建立管制機構之唯一阻撓者。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十二日廣播：美代表奧斯汀十二日在聯大政委會中發表演說，指責蘇聯阻碍永久和平，成脅世界和平，拒絕與聯合國合作，並破壤柏林危機之解決，奧氏演說係於馬歇爾自美返巴黎後數小時發表。消息靈通人土謂，奧氏對蘇猛烈抨擊，表示西方列强已開始拋棄一切妥協企圖，進而要求譴責蘇聯為世界和平之威脅者。奧氏謂蘇聯領袖抱有重大之誤解，渠堅持不同之經濟及政治體系可以餅肩存在，並籲請聯合國設法消除蘇聯之誤解。奧氏檢討美國之軍備計劃，承認美國在大戰以後，「裁减軍備太甚並太速」。奧氏以激動語調痛斥維辛斯基指責美國「製造戰爭」一語為宣傳策略，特別攻擊蘇聯所提中·美·英·法·蘇五强在一九四九年份裁軍三分之一之建議，指為含有惡意。奧氏確言在對日及對德和約未曾訂定以前，談不到軍備裁减，因此等軍備實為保障世界和平之必要條件。奧氏旋提及蘇聯在原子及軍縮問題之爭議中，拒絕開放其領土以供聯合國調査其是否履行條約。渠謂蘇聯迄未提供該國願意參加世界機構之保證。</p>
<h3>蘇聯代表維辛斯基表示　願披露軍力詳情　但須西方提供同樣情報　演說時面紅耳赤痛罵戰爭販子</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十二日電〕蘇聯代表維辛斯基表示願發表其軍力之詳情，然西方亦應同時提供同樣之報吿，包括原子彈及細菌戰具等武器在內。蘇聯在美國「攤牌桌上」發表其原子彈藏眞相前，拒絕向世界報吿其三軍力量。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十二日電〕聯大政委會十二日下午會議中，蘇聯首席代表維辛斯基發表情文並茂聲勢洶洶之演說，指斥西方代表攻擊蘇聯時，「猶如脫　之馬，而打破一切限度」·渠批評英美法代表「毒素」言論，毀謗蘇聯，且不惜採用任何手段。西方圖在「幕後破壞」蘇聯之五强一年內縮軍三分之一之建議。渠稱，有充份證據證明「世界上有大批煽動戰爭之人」。維氏怒稱，西方國家於一九三九年圖促使希特勒進攻蘇聯。「如諸君要求本人攤牌桌上」，渠自稱能加以證明。維氏逐一檢討西方代表之軍縮演說，並斥英代表蕭克洛斯「心智已完全失缺平衡，其道德觀念亦浼然無遺。渠大駡西方圖以原子彈阻撓一切進展，並不肯裁軍·維氏演說一小時以上，其措辭之激烈得未曾有，無遜於美代表奧斯丁之演說。維氏演說時仍出之以檢察官作風，面紅耳赤，在椅中跳　不停，雙手瘋狂左右揮動，伸指直點他國代表，擊桌高呼。渠不時回身直指座後英代表麥克尼爾，四座不時因其態度激烈，不時大笑，特別於維氏提到蘇聯不要求廬森堡　軍之時，渠演說至一小時二十分，沿漫罵不息。</p>

<h3>美加速動員準備　增編保安隊為步兵師裝甲師　確定工業軍事化新計劃</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日電〕美國防部長福萊斯特將召集軍方工業報界敎育工會與宗敎等各方面之領袖舉行會議，商討如何在必要時使美國之動員工作易於進行，會期定十一月八日至十日，會議之結果將嚴守秘密。國防部發言人稱：由於國際局勢之惡化，遂使美國各方面活動有加緊聯繫之必要。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕據今日宣佈，美保安隊將於明年初完成其步兵師及裝甲師改編工作，使其實力界正規陸軍相等。據透露，保安隊步兵廿五師每師將增編自動高射砲兵及重坦克車兵各一營。其他改革，各裝甲兵兩師，每師增編榴彈野砲兵及自動高射砲兵各一營。據宣佈，步兵師軍力將自官兵一萬三千人增至一萬四千人，裝甲師人員將自九千人增至一萬二千人。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕美國防官員頃佔計一旦戰爭爆發，美工業可在十八個月內改作軍火生產。彼等稱，改作軍用工業之新計劃，已將第二次大戰之方法改良不少。使改變生產之期間大為縮短。美聯合參謀部估計今後全國「總體」作戰之準備時間將極為短促。為應付威脅起見，該部已要求全國安全資源局及軍火局籌劃加速全國生產之計劃。軍火局業已在計劃積聚價値廿億元一之戰略物資，並在地下倉庫中存積大量生產工具。此外又計劃：（一）陸海空三軍採購物資標準化；（二）運輸，人力，電力及其他服務之研究及控制；（三）分散工業，俾受到轟炸時，全國工業潛力不致受損。</p>

<h3>法政府草就計劃　預防共產黨叛亂　巴黎郊外十萬勁旅待命</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十二日電〕機密報告十一日稱：法政府業已草就詳細計劃，一且發生武裝叛變，卽於一小時自動整個控制巴黎，以防叛軍之奪取首都。政府軍警一支特殊都隊計十萬人，曾受特別訓練，專事應　，主其事者卽內長莫許，蓋渠對共黨及戴高樂派均深惡痛絕。報吿稱，法政府如遭威脅，不問來自極左或極右，該計劃卽將付諸實施。據悉，自共黨主持去年十一月大罷工後一，該計劃已有更改，對目前因卅一五萬礦工發端之工潮，智珠在握，巳有對策應付。按法國叛變之發生地點，傳統以巴黎為中心，故該計劃之目的，在於叛軍攻佔首都軍略要點外，政府軍先發制人加以佔領。在叛變前危機中，軍隊暫註巴黎郊外，去年十一月卽用此法。該批軍隊高度摩托化，一旦有事卽可在半小時內自凡爾賽。聖先門及其他警備城鎭馳入首都，市內則由警察枕戈待命。按諸上述報告，軍警可控制下述軍略要點，警察總局·總統寓邸。內政部。市政廳。總電台。陸軍部·火車站及電力工會。政府相信上述神經中樞一旦在握，卽可迅速撲平叛亂，叛軍如武裝輕微，更可一鼓成擒。奉命鎭壓叛亂之勁旅據稱，係身經百戰之第二裝甲師團及北非及伊內加爾之步槍隊。過去兩年內，已揭發若干地下軍火，而獲得大量重武器，並相信叛軍所能據以作戰者，最多為步槍機關槍及手溜彈而已。至於重型武器及飛機，卽悉在政府控制之下。如叛黨出其不意展開暴動，政府軍祇須能初期　　局面，卽可打破一切　　政權之武裝革命。</p>

<h3>吉田茂組織新閣聲中　日政黨意見分岐　今提名首揆民自黨尙無把握</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕日衆議院十二日下午五時召開議院運營委員會，討論首揆提名選舉事項，席間民主黨方面首先發言稱：「民自黨組織舉國一致內閣時，則予協力，我黨決定之此方針，業已通知該黨，俟其回答後，再由最高幹部會決定態度，故希望提名選舉延至明日舉行」。繼之民自然代表稱：「民主黨之提議有需要檢討之處，故本黨亦希望提名選舉，延期一日一，結果將提名選舉，改於十三日下午舉行。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕日政局變化目前已入混沌階段，除民主自由黨積極凖備卽將舉行之首揆提名選舉外，其他各政黨大都採取觀望態度。民主自由黨今後之首揆提名與組閣工作仍有困維，截至目前止，各政黨態度如下：</p>
<p>（一）民主黨現以舉國聯合內閣問題，與提名吉田問題為交換，否則該黨將於首揆提名選舉時，投以空白票。該黨大約分為三派：一派主張立刻下野：一派主張選出吉田後再下野，另一派則主張如吉田允諾組織舉國聯合內閣、則與吉田合作，否則下野。</p>
<p>（二）社會黨因民主直由黨曾提倡排出社會黨之保守統一戰綫之聯合內閣，故社會黨與民主自由黨在目前仍無妥協之可能，故該黨已決定提名片山為下屆首揆候選人。</p>
<p>（三）國協黨現將首揆提我與參加新閣分為截然兩事。外傳此係受麥帥暗示之結果，該黨仍將考慮民主自由黨所提出之政策後，始決定是否參加新內閣。此外，社會革新黨，農民黨及第一議員俱樂部已決定擁護吉田，而共產黨與勞農黨則已決定提名黑田壽男為下屆首揆候選人。</p>

<h3>燃管會人員　被控舞弊內幕　孫繼策等今日公審　傳有關證人逾四十</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前上海區燃料管理委員會統配處長孫繼策（後調任工商部烟煤調節供應處處長），及該處業務科長林克楹等，共同利用職務上之便利，勒索商人會污舞弊案，前經市政府將該案人犯及全部案卷，移送地院拘押，定於今日上午九時，由謝志英推事在該院刑八庭初審，並傳有關證人四十餘人出庭應訊。據悉：孫等被控在該處任職期間，凡商人向該處申請配購煤斤，該處故予壓制，無理减少其配量。</p>
<p>商人索賄，方肯增發其配給量，或將餘煤轉售黑市，而分潤其利益。並悉此項配給煤以交由本市北京路八五〇國弄二十號建華煤號老關韓承溥代售黑市者為最多。該韓承溥前因燃管會運輸處長楊耘夫貪污案傳案偵訊，經市警察局傳訊孫繼策，林克楹及華光煤號，申湖聯合營業處，松江電氣公司及各輪船公司負責人後，發見該統配處及運輸處之</p>
<p>貪污舞弊情形甚詳。蓋燃管會對本市各輪船公司及工廠之需用煤斤者，向有配煤辦法之規定，申請配煤者，須塡具燃煤消耗表，經同業公會之證明，送請該會調查屬實後，核定每月配給數額，此項調查及核配之工作，均由該會統配處主管。自該會前任主任委員徐樂天去職，由經濟部　派張希為接任後（按張係於肝六年六月到任），孫繼策亦隨張出任該會統配處長，孫與該處科長林克楹因鑒於該會配給煤價與市塲價格</p>
<p>相差甚鉅，配價遠較黑市價格低廉，乃對輪船公司及工廠之申請配煤索取賄賂，凡與該處有勾通之商人，該處卽增加其配煤數量，至超過其實際消耗量一倍以上。甚至有業已停止營業之商號，亦可不經公會之證明，及該會之調查，而仍按月配給大量煤斤，各受配人則將該會所發棧單直接售諸黑市，</p>
<p>所得利潤（卽配價與黑市價之差額）以四成歸統配處，六成歸配商人。其中有數家聯合推派代表與統配處接洽者，亦有個別單獨與統配處接洽者。該案經地院今日開庭後，當可獲悉其全部案情。</p>

<h3>中港關務協定簽訂後　巡視文錦渡關卡</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者</p>
<p>〔本報香港九日航訊〕中港關務協定簽訂後翌日，記者特跑到中英邊界的文錦渡關卡去巡視一番·由九龍搭火車至上水站，轉乘公共汽車，約十多分鐘，卽到文錦渡。過文錦渡關卡，步行約半小時，便是深圳圩，廣九鐵路雖有深圳站，但離圩市頗遠，一般往來深圳和九龍的單帮客，多經由文錦渡·月前東江共匪攻陷拜亞士灣的沙頭角時，中英邊界上巍然獨存的一個關卡就是文錦渡，可見牠的重要性。</p>
<p>行旅車輛受檢從文錦渡車站下車，拐了一個小彎，便到文錦渡橋。橋塊有英方警署一所，有警察持槍把守，行旅車輛到此，必須受檢查，然後通過。過了橋，行約百步，便是文錦渡，關卡在華界的一邊橋堍，有中國憲兵兩人把守，態度從容，不如英方警察的「像煞介事。」據文錦渡關員說，附近鄉民携帶少量糧食前往英界，每天往返多次。但他或她的廬山眞面目，一經認出，便不准再出關。大規模的走私祇有在夜裏抄山徑而過，從來沒有經過關卡大路的。記者在關卡逗留半小時，目覩受檢查的過路鄉民數十人，貨車七輛，關員對於販運少量糧食以資糊口的鄉人，多予通融辦理。因此，文錦渡英界的公共汽車站上，堆滿了一袋一袋的食米和其他雜糧。聽說米糧運到香港去，可獲倍利。</p>
<p>香港出入口署在上水半哩外也設有一個緝私站，香港緝私的對象，以烟酒為主。</p>

<h3>中國科學家與國家建設　上接二版</h3>
<p>第二是以科學中心的敎育提高科學的知識：在科學落後的國家，科學家一面從事專門研究之中，一面就得負起普及化與培育後起的重任，這二方面在目前中國尤須等量兼重。今日我國的科學家，除少數在研究機關中從事研究外，大抵兼負中等以上學校敎育的責任，此次聯合年會的討論，大家很重視科學敎育的普及與提高，並措意於中小學的科學設備與敎材，是很合理而可喜的事。由於八年戰亂的破壞，今日大學專校之科學設備或工塲，够得上標準已是鳳麟；至於中學校有一套理化儀器的更少，小學更不必說。各級學校經費，什八九用於薪津而設備費奇窘。今後政府自亟應切實改正此一錯誤，學校中科學敎師尤須本此目標，作多方面的督促和協助。社會敎育並不是孤立的事業，而可補救中小學設備的不足，例如一個博物館中較完備的生物標本，一個大圖書館中充實的科學岡書，都是科學敎育的利器。至於妨碍研究與安定表現於咸脅或罷課的學潮，一年來摧殘敎育與科學的現實敎訓够嚴重了！敎授學者縱還不能看穿其內在的陰謀，為科學前途為自身職責計，也該切實防範阻止，自更不待言了</p>
<p>第三，以科學理知的思想改造學術與社會的風氣：建國事業，經緯萬端，科學家以專門研究自效於國家建設，更以科學敎育來培育後起，提高一般科學知識，可是他對於建國最普及也最根本的貢獻，可說別有大者：那就是反科學思想的改造，合乎科學的心理建設，以此來領導學風與社會的風氣·盧於道氏為聯合年會寫了一篇論文，說科學最大特徵，在思想上是「不斷求進步」，一反泥古而特重「求眞」，在實現上是組織與合作，一反凌亂而特重計劃，我們非常同情。不過盧氏所貶斥的似還偏於保守的舊勢力，而我們今日所不解所痛心的對象，却是廣大的智識分子，尤其是旁皇中的靑年，因為不幸得很，他們的心理與生活的表現往往是反科學的。科學之可貴在求眞，在崇尙理智，——反獨斷，反敎條，反盲從。可是就近年大學風氣來說，有的是奉行敎條的靑年，有的是持志不定附和盲從的靑年，此外更有不少理智被攪擾意志被威脅以致無所可否的學生·科學思想在訓練個人明辨是非，而很多大學有脅持式的學生團體，迫人盲從，甚至不恤訴諸暴力·科學是成於點滴積累，需要耐心有恒，而他們只是頌揚淺嘗模擬的風氣，鄙夷研究力學，甚至隨時以罷課脅迫為手段。此種風氣和宣傳影響人心，使敎育界與一般社會瀰漫一種空虛淺薄輕信盲從的風習·而最不幸的是「可欺以其方」的有專門造詣的敎授，對此事態很多坐視，而不以科學的基本原則（求進步，反凌亂）出來說話，加以糾正。學者們初則受愚弄以為要超然自持，終於受學生脅制而屈服於反科學的氣氛之下，不用說其研究工作與敎學都遭嚴重的挫折了，我們於此，全不是從政治立塲來論貶畢潮，而只是從敎育或科學的立塲來剖析利害。我們深感最近當局傳訊嫌疑學生，必須愼重與合法·可是照過去一二年若干大學中，由放任而造　成的破壞學術研究的行動，其影響於中小學與社會風氣之惡劣，實在與頑固封建的舊勢力，足以「異塗同歸」的阻撓科學嫩芽的成長與進步！</p>
<p>要之，此種反科學的心理與風氣一旦不除，那將使專門研究與科學敎育的努力皆成白費，更不必說建立「建國的風氣」了。所以，今日的科學家不問政治則可，不問反科學勢力之摧殘科學則不可。我們愛眞理，愛國家，根本之圖，莫過於大胆的揭破反科學反國家的陰謀，努力於愛眞理愛人羣之科學的心理建設。以此轉移社會風氣，然後專門研究之自效於建設，與科學敎育之培育後起，才能有迎頭趕上的進步。這應是今日中國科學家對國家建設的神聖使命。</p>

<p>又配售美國色布〇二－K一三色粗布，每公尺七角四分，〇一六色布，每公尺八角。</p>
<h3>棉布旺銷</h3>
<p>自靑運閣棉布掮客暗盤交易，遭受拘究後，而門莊布號，去化仍甚暢旺，因此供稀求多，紛向棉布批發商添補，致各大疋頭批發商號，如永信公司等，莫不生涯鼎盛，各零剪門售商，排隊憑會員證及店章批購者蟬聯不斷，市勢堅俏異常。</p>
<h3>紗商討論處置存紗</h3>
<p>棉紗市塲停止交易後，日前紗商業一再請求當局，早日核定營業範闖，惟迄今未獲核定。該業公會昨日下午，再度召開理監事會，對（一）促請經督處提早核定配售限額，及運銷商營業尺度。（二）紗號存貨登記後之所存棉紗處置二間題，予以討論。</p>
<h3>絲綢均俏</h3>
<p>人絲自配售後，交易日趨沉寂，絲織業納意甚淡，複製業申購尙殷，絲號門銷日來亦見淡薄，去化已呆。公會配售定額，昨日竟未售完。</p>
<p>生絲市况，洋行帮因外銷貨難以購到，交易沉寂，市况在限價下，脫手甚少，本街零担略有成交，數極零星。</p>
<p>綢緞前以本街門銷盛旺，被面等貨搜購一空，近日洋行帮因生絲無貨應市，均改辦綢緞銷印，市上求多供少，市氣挺秀，內銷貨門市去化，連日因限制購買，走勢稍軟，公會卽將開配，廠方供售轉少。</p>
<h3>留存上海美棉　不再運濟他埠</h3>
<p>據棉紡織業悉，此次內地紗廠申請分配美棉，多因運輸關係，無法按時運至廠地。而內地廠商領到美棉以後，又必須將其紡成之棉紗繳交上海美棉花紗布聯營處，往返運輸旣不便，又所耗費用亦多。有關方面正在擬議，以今後國棉聯購處在內地所收購之棉花，抵充美棉，撥付內地廠商，以省運費，至存留上海之美棉，儘量撥交上海一帶廠商，就地紡成棉紗，繳交美棉花紗布聯營處，統籌銷售云。</p>
<h3>煤炭來源激減</h3>
<p>寒冬將屆，煤銷日增，但到貨益見缺少，以致同業存底均甚薄弱，而不願脫手，進購殊感不易·藍本市過去煤源端賴開灤，（最多時達十五萬噸，恰為本市需用量），然自北寗路時遭匪徒破壞後，來源頓吿激减。迨至上月僅及半數，不料本月每况愈下，迄今祇到二千餘噸。其他口岸亦因軍運繁忙，交通受阻，而影響煤運，乃煤荒益臻嚴重階段。且烟煤調節供應處，突又奉令撤消，　盒務　　將由正在儲償中之全國夜商聯會會　辦。並由政府設一烟樣調節委員監　與審核配價，切盼該會火速成立，以免來　中斷。</p>
<h3>輸管會呈請政院決定　僑資輸入辦法</h3>
<p>國人在外資產及僑資輸入生產器材辦法，自經公佈以來，適逢財政經濟緊急處分令實施，若干細則，因與財經緊急處分令小有抵　，故迄未正式實行。並經輸出入管理委員會，擬具修正辦法，通同自備外匯已付款項訂購物資處理辦法，及外幣存單動用辦法，呈送行政院審核，迄今未見核示，輸管會經督處及中央銀行方面，鑒於是項辦法之平日實施，足以有助於增加生產及安定物價，故已決定由輸管會呈請政院，早日決定。並聞央行副總裁劉攻芸氏。亦已專電財次徐柏圜氏，就近代為請求云。</p>
<h3>外銷茶將易少</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，交易依然萎靡，良以輸出商鹽於歐菲各地需茶殷切，故買氣仍殷，但終因產存均枯，執戶態度猶豫，趨勢續呈僧多粥少，卒難蔓額做開，而形勢巍站有勁。</p>
<p>頃據同業談稱：本市某貿易公司，最近亦擬增關茶葉出口部，大致不久卽將正式成立，惟際此貨稀聲中，該公司為未雨綢繆計，目前對於屯綠等，漸有蠕蠕活動之象，照此情形，前途更將熟鬧。至於內銷茶，亦仍進多出少，過程靜中帶堅。</p>
<h3>工業協會調查　各業所需原料</h3>
<p>據工業協會技術委員會負責人談稱，該會　使當局調　本市八十一　過去生產數量，　要原料情形，以便解決目前困難起見，日來正分別召集各業　家，　極研究中，預定本月　可將全部瞥料呈送督導員辦公處參考云。</p>
<h3>電鍍工業原料　會員憑證購貨</h3>
<p>本市電鍍工業，近以原料有限，　　引起　購之度。該業公會爲限制起見，特委託日昇昌號等，規定每會員憑證每次　貨，以黃油乙打，白油乙打，砂粉局包，克凡乙磅，　凡乙磅，牛皮膠乙磅，臬板每隔五天乙塊（約六，七磅）爲限，往購者頗為踴躍。</p>
<h3>中次秈稍有做開　食米將易微細　麵粉食油昨均停市</h3>
<p>食米昨交易淸稀，南市塲形同停市，白粳薄稱絕跡，中次秈米依限有微額成交，北市塲米號業自運自銷，開售六百零七石，米廠業採辦運銷二百五十石，兩市到貨略增，共計一千三百九十九石。麵粉未開。</p>
<p>雄糧昨絕少做開，黃豆卽將重行登記，據云將實行全面配給，効法於食油，惟尙未證實。昨市到稀存枯，未有成交，紅糧苞米菉豆生仁全無做開，只芝蔴路有成交，南京白蔴開三十元，鄱陽黑蔴開二十八元，統市成交七八十包。食油昨日停市。</p>
<h3>大批食米即可抵滬</h3>
<p>又訊；食米到貨稀落，供求失其平衡，市呈有行無市狀態，經濟督導員辦公處為此，曾傳訊米市塲及米業公會負責人，責令負責本埠食米，每月供應二十五萬擔，嗣經米業公會議決，由各米行米商前往產地收購以濟市需。頃悉：開始以來，各米商向各地採購，總數截至十月八日止，已達一萬零數百擔，業已全部由社會局發給採購證，不日卽可陸續　來本市。</p>
<h3>糖市冷落</h3>
<p>食糖昨日交易冷落，塲已籌碼稀少，各檔有買無賣，本街納意極濃，同業供售甚鮮，走勢堅倘，惟因價格均登限度，無法做高，但人心頗多俏利，結果交易呆滯，成交零星。</p>
<h3>上週零售物價指數　衣着等類上漲</h3>
<p>據東方經濟研究所發表上週（本月四日至九日）之本市基要日用品零售物價指數如下：</p>
<p>（一）食物類為二·一一倍，較之前週無漲跌；</p>
<p>（二）衣着類為二·四九倍，較前週上漲百分之二·八九；</p>
<p>（三）燃料類為二·二八倍，較前週上漲百分之〇·八九；</p>
<p>（四）雜項類為三·七六倍，較前週上漲百分之一·三五；</p>
<p>（五）總指數為二·五九倍，較前週上漲百分之一·一七。</p>
<p>上週之物價，因搶購之刺激而上漲。其中以衣着類上漲最多，雜項類次之，惟一般價格均仍在限價以下云。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>

<p>捲烟交易，仍無正常做開。各貨績在堅檔徘徊·各地去化益旺，同業進意殊濃。各廠派貨雖吿不絕，但鬥售應接不暇，本街銷路　暢，喊價依舊高昂。</p>
<p>火油調整價格，政府尙須考慮，由社局物價評議委員會評斷後，方可作為最後決定。記者詢火油門售店，謂現在售價，散裝每　十五元三角三分，遠聽每聽十六元五角，迄昨午尙未接獲公會之停售通知。</p>
<p>自木材與建築材料缺貨問題，益趨嚴重後，水木工人咸感工作未能順利進行。其包工工作有不得不暫時中輟者，工人方面則以面協無米爲炊之象，又以請願無門，乃呈惴惴不安。</p>
<p>關於磚瓦水泥之缺貨，與發生黑市，已由該業公會刊載啓事，予以承認。茲悉：石灰一項，原在蘇州河老垃圾橋一帶碼頭起卸，近日灰販將到船避至曹家渡，北新涇起卸，開售價超出限價一倍有餘，致更引起同業之惶恐。聞昨晨曹家渡等處亦未見有灰船到達。</p>
<p>牛毛毡，柏油，等建築材料，由於美手等公司油價調整，喊價亦均跟升而上。聞美貨牛毛毡喊五十元尙難買進，柏油加一倍（卽一元）尙無買出。</p>

<h3>世界棒球錦標賽　印第安隊膺冠軍　六賽四勝二負比爾登聲威大振</h3>
<p>〔合衆社波士頓十一日電〕克里夫蘭印第安隊，十一日在世界棒球錦標賽第六次比賽中，以四比三力克波士頓勇士隊，榮膺本屆世界錦標。克隊與波已共作六次比賽，克隊勝四塲，波隊勝二塲。按世界棒球錦標賽係採取七賽四勝制，克歐已勝四塲。今第六塲比賽得分如左：</p>
<p>印第安001002010　4　　　0</p>
<p>盤數　一二三四五六七八九　總分　安打　失誤</p>
<p>勇士　000100020　3　９　0</p>
<p>印第安：投手雷猛及比爾登，捕手赫根。</p>
<p>勇士：投手伏叟及史影，捕手沙各爾及馬歇。</p>
<p>〔又電〕克里扶蘭城印第安隊，十一日再以四比三擊敗波士頓勇士隊，完成六戰四勝二負之偉績，榮膺一九四八年世界棒球冠軍。此或使棒球有世以來最富有之比賽達於高潮，克里扶蘭左手神投將比爾登經六塲大戰，一躍而為棒壇英雄。按上星期一，印第安隊與波士頓城紅襪隊積分相等，重決全美聯賽冠軍，比爾登投出妙球無算，大敗紅襪，而為母隊爭得決賽世界冠軍之資格。印勇第三戰，比爾登之左手又使勇士一濤莫戰，繳上白卷。今日之戰，印隊投手雷猛至第八回合，已有衰替之狀，印第安管理滿德羅孤注一擲，調比爾登入塲替下爾猛，果然勇士說氣被奪，無法反敗為勝。</p>
<p>勇士雖敗，曾在第八盤中，有鼓作氣，扭轉乾坤之勢、勇士初用投手老將伏叟，被印第安予取予求，乃調昨日獲勝之左手旋球射手史彭上陣，疲兵再戰，也端的厲害。惟失分過多，不克挽回大局，坐令印第安償二十八年之宿願，背得錦標而去。</p>

<h3>什麼最貴？</h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>自從八一九限價後，您說什麼東西漲的最多？</p>
<p>無論什麼，大約都還有個譜兒，卽使漲了點兒，也不致差的太多；唯有一樣，可眞「　王爺打跟頭－離板兒了！」這就是舊書。</p>
<p>舊書生意，很走了幾年背運，自從勝利後，二百折一，價錢受了一大頓挫；之後，因為新刊物新作品配合着「新人物」，如雨後春筍，舊東西開始發霉，書架上的老古董，常常二三年翻不了身，連間也沒人問。而且，新書是日新月異的往上加倍，由幾十倍而數十萬倍，信口開河，說一不二，舊書旣沒有主顧，又那能如此，眼看擺新書擁予和賣新書的店家大賺鈔票，再進而兼營投機股票，竟有從此大發財源的，舊書店老板，依然日日坐他的冷板凳，焉能不有所動於中。因之大多數舊書店，赶快出淸存貨，改營新書，眼看架子上的標帙芸香，一律換成報紙本子，由馮玉奇而茅盾巴金，文武崑亂不擋，從此冷冰冰的面孔，也就變作笑吟吟。至於怎肅出淸存貨，說起來眞慘，大多數是論斤稱賣，作為廢紙爛紙，經過一番整理，再去還魂！有一陣子連廣東刻本的「四庫全書總目提要」都稱了斤，因為按分量賣比按部頭賣還可以多賺一倍呢－也有些比較愛護斯文的店家，不肯把聖經賢傳付之萬刦不復便從新改訂價目，其改訂之標準，也是以分量來計算的，可是終於不如乾脆稱了斤，到底也賣不出去。去年冬天，北平因為這樣糟踏的書太多，才有人出來說話·主張由政府出資一百億來收買，作為救濟舊書業，嚷嚷了多少日子，算是由敎育部撥了十億，交由北京大學全權負責收買，聽內行的人說，這麽一點錢，也不過援救下來九牛之一毛而已，舊書之從此罹刦者簡直不可勝數。</p>
<p>誰也想不到在牛弘五厄之外，還有這一厄，－還魂厄！而這一刦比水火刀兵又全厲害。水火刀兵虫鼠呑蝕是部分的，一隅的，這却是全面的、整個的。如果發展下去，可能全部舊書，都將走入淪亡的命運。幸而來了一位救命星君－金圓散仙」！從此滄海又化　田，舊書又翻了身，可是這回翻得又未免太凶些，從前是人們拒他於千里之外，如今是他拒人於千里之外了。</p>
<p>八一九以前，舊書每册價目頂貴的也不過五十萬元，普通都在十萬元左右，合起金圓來，在三分至二角之間。如今呢，極起碼的書也要你五角，風行一點，版子好一點的總得一圓以上！八一九以前，我到舊書店去買漢書補注。八十本書，不過五百至六百萬元；如今呢，至少十五塊！有的索至二十塊。請算算看，豈不是漲了整整十倍？據說這還是客氣的，有的則一下子漲了二十倍。愛買不買！太來舊書是沒有版權頁，談不到定價的，你若檢舉他漲價，又有什麽憑據？所以顧客只有啼笑皆非，束手無策。</p>
<p>據內行人說，這種漲風，也不完全由於敲竹槓。大家重貨輕幣，這也是一種反映，因為最近他們同行「拍貨」也是貴得豈有此理。（書業買到成批舊書，或有店家願出售存貨，公開擇地，同行拍價買賣，謂之拍貨，先年皆以封筒寫封出價，今則如拍賣場之喊價矣。）譬如越縵堂日記不帶補的竟有拍至二百元者！翁文恭日記亦須一百五十左右，若按原書定價，已高出數倍。（二書皆商務影印，定價在五十至四十之間。）不是過於胡鬧嗎？實則同行競買，不見得立卽付款，而若有顧客，肯出適當現價，卽使比拍價略低，亦未嘗不可買到現貨。這種病態，不是瘋在嗎？同行之間，尙且如此，對於外行，可想而知。</p>
<p>全國舊書店如今也是寥寥可數的了，北平，上海，蘇州，南京數大城外，幾已絕迹。我們弄弄舊東西的人，常存絕滅之懼，宋代的麻沙建陽，出版業何嘗不盛，可是如今却連影子也沒有了！今之明淸版本，卽數百年後之「善本」，猶之今日之視「宋元」。但書賈是以利為前提，不以文化為本位的，像前者之稱斤論値，與今之暴利敲剝，全是一個摧殘！我們希望當局有合理的處置與管理，否則文化前途，總有些可怕，因為文化的資源都要被人襲斷了！</p>
<h3>漲價</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>不知道我這樣想法太膚代否：國人對經濟一道，極富天資，雖說識字敎育尙須積極推行，但自法幣誕生以來，極少發見有不識鈔票者，儘管幣券圖式紛繁，種類衆多，但販夫走卒，娘姨小大姐，無不一目了然，至於關金折法幣，　　合金元，計算起來，尤屬熟練之極。</p>
<p>再者，雖然咱們社會裏，有無數人沒上過學堂，然而上至豪富巨室，下至小小攤販及三輪車夫各級人等，均能熟誦成本律，供求律，結論則證明漲價乃天經地義，而且雖已漲價，依然虧蝕，如果再一推論，便是「勢將關門，失業可慮」云云。大老闆綜談此大道理時，正襟危坐，面有憂色，小商販暢訴生意難做時，本正經，煞介事。其表情，其讜論，鮮有不令人深深感動者</p>
<p>勝利後不久，市上美貨充斥，行商無不痛論民族工商業前途之可哀；後來美貨限制進口，國貨抬頭，廠·店·批發·零會，則大漲其價；漲價姑置不論，他一們又進而大事渲染其「賣掉了補不進」的定律；我起初對此話十分同情，但經仔細思量之後，便覺大謬不然，蓋此次賣掉之價格，乃屬上次補進之成太與利潤之和也，下次再補進，賣價亦復如是。且有許多商品，老早補進，老晚售出，營利可知。怎說賣掉了補不進呢？這與顚倒物價與指數的因果，一樣不通（</p>
<p>是故，漲價本為經濟學上的常理，但一經人為手法巧妙應用，便令人難信其必有道理。</p>
<p>舉個例：「八一九」後許多批發價都給限定了，柴米油鹽價也不動了，公用事業及員工薪給也凍結了，但零售店仍認限價有點「那個」；例如猪肉，不但批發價未超限價，且九月份宰猪數比八月份多一萬餘隻，但竟有黑市與缺貨現象。究其實，因為以前放任慣了。我不敢否定物價是活的，但有許多東西的漲價，毫無根據，漫無標準，的確是事實。再說，零售商為門檻內人，對批發商決不讓其超越限價，但一般消費者並不買一件東西均索取發票，所以雖云限價雷厲風行，實際上許多東西零售價在「八一九後早已數易碼子。這幾天來，柳野上下集中注意於物資供應問題，許多老闆含笑打烊，後門口「自由貿易」，黑價白價，更已悉聽尊裁。生意眞的難做嗎？</p>
<p>再說三輪車和娘姨小大姐吧：前者車租仍為每日一百五十萬法幣，但車價狂漲結果，車夫每日已可得十元金券（較薪水階級高出多倍）；娘姨們從前以三斗米或四斗米論薪，原屬極其合理，但現在米價不動了她們便再不提起米了，而說現在外間行情都是十元，十五元。我無意非難勞力階級，不過這情形，這心理，適足證明一般。</p>
<p>漲價原不應屬於違法，但仔細研究一下，大都屬於貪求無厭。長此以往，咱們拿凍結薪水的，便只好聽憑宰割了！怎麽辦？</p>
<h3>絕技</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>有一位先生（女）領了薪水回家，從江灣路上經過，過一丰度翩翩的西裝客，掏出一張十元金圓券，向她很有禮貌的問道：「您有五元一張的票子嗎？請換給我兩張。」某先生是個好心人，便拿出薪水包預備換給他。不料那人却把薪水包接過來說：「讓我看看有沒有一元一張的。「一面說，一面翻動。一張一張地點過之後，卽把薪水包原封不動地交還某先生，說：「不換也罷。「說畢，揚長而去。某先生接過薪水包，快要到家的時候，心中總覺得剛的事有些蹊蹺，乃取出薪水包檢視一下，奇怪，五元券竟少了四張。</p>
<p>她把這事在辦公室說給大家聽，聽者莫不悚然。這時，另一位先生却說出一件更神秘驚人的事，也是他自己的經驗：去年某月某日下午，他帶了兩衣袋滿滿的鈔票，不記得數目有多少，反正是一筆大款子，可以購好幾石白米，在南京路上經過，沒有乘電車，也沒有與人相撞，却不知在什麽時候，遭了歹人的暗算，兩個袋子已空空如也了。一在上海，憑著這類絕技生活的人，正不知多少哩（一）</p>
<h3>豪華騙局</h3>
<p>— 石文</p>
<p>從來權臣們最大的本領就是要會得欺君罔上，把上面的人朦在鼓裏，自已就可以放心大膽的為非作歹了。</p>
<p>精明如俄國的喀薩林女皇，竟也不免受欺。</p>
<p>一七八七年，俄國的波丹金大元帥向喀蕯林女皇奏稱，新近征服的克里米亞已經人口繁茂，頗見興旺·女皇却也利害，她曉得克里米亞本來是一片荒凉地方，聽波丹金說得這樣好，倒動了疑心，就堅持要親自去看看，</p>
<p>過了幾個月，波丹金居然就請她臨幸克里米亞了。她欣然前往，登艦從但尼伯河順洗而下，走了一千二百哩水程，一路上彼丹金不斷的在甲板上點給她看，但見兩岸阡陌縱橫。到處都是欣欣向榮的田畝，再看各村莊裏也熟鬧非凡·擠滿了愉快的農人。</p>
<p>喀蕯林女皇大表滿意，也沒有上岸，就吩咐啓椗回到了俄京。</p>
<p>某實這一切景物完全是假的·那些村鎭都是用戲院裏的佈景搭出來的，所有的那些農人也是出了重價僱來的伶人，一到夜裏，佈景立刻拆下，演員們也立刻述夜趕到前面一段路，明晨船開到的時候，兩岸又熙熙攘攘，有一片太平景象，佈景也搭好了，演員們也又在穿來穿去了。</p>
<p>精明幹練的喀蕯林竟然沒有識破這個警局·但是，好大喜功的波丹金元帥也着實破費了不少，照當時的匯率算起來，他為了排演這一齣「戲」，竟用掉了四十億美元。</p>
<h3>定時炸彈</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>第二次大戰慘烈進行時，美國特務工作人員對羅斯福總統的安全極盡護衛之能事，任何人送給他的禮物都須經過精密檢查，然後送給總統。南美洲某國的元首和羅氏感情很好，送了不少食物給他，不想送的人果是一片好心，半途中却給德國間諜們在食物中下了毒樂，虧得發覺很早，總算無事。有一次，一個郵局職員忽然電話報吿警局，說：有一個寫明寄給總統的包裏，內有鐘擺聲音，頗為可疑，不知道會不會是定時炸彈。特務人員趕到啓視，果然是定時炸彈，大家對這位郵局職員大為獎勵。不料，過了幾天，那位郵局職員却被當局送進了精神病療養院－</p>
<p>原來經特務人員悉心追究之後，發見了投寄那個定時炸彈的人竟就是那個郵局職員！為了想出風頭，他竟不惜干犯法紀，輕率弄險·本來要判罪的，後來檢查出他有神經病，所以把他送進醫院了事·</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>古代之殺大臣</p>
<p>禮之敝，在敎人相率而為僞，由此作僞之一念為中心，而產生歷史上之諸多儀制，使千百年後吾人讀之猶有可噴飯者。</p>
<p>如占代，以殺大臣為不幸事，不得巳而用刑，須通過許多戲劇化之儀式，以暗示法律之階級性，而表面則以「禮」之一名詞掩之。</p>
<p>漢制：宰相有罪，天子使人持節乘白午車，賜牛酒，盤水　繼，策吿災變。使者將發，丞相報病，半途，尙書以丞相病不起聞，天子為之發喪，輟刺三日。</p>
<p>其作僞已極可笑矣，若更溯往古，則為狀尤醜。禮記：「公族有罪，甸人吿於王，王曰宥之，士師日不可；再曰宥之，士師曰不可；三曰宥之，土師不聽，走出。王使人迫之，曰無及矣！」</p>
<p>凡此諸種醜態，固足以證明古代之所謂禮制，割開眞面實不値一錢；然而牛酒之賜，三宥之呼，至少尙可看出：大臣親貴有罪伏跦，在古代為一常態之事實。在「刑不上大夫」幾乎成為絕對眞理之今日，又使人深感歷史去人之遠也　!</p>
<h3>秋蟲吟</h3>

<h3>Ensuring Yantai Port: Gui Yongqing Once Went to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Report from our Qingdao Bureau, 12th] Sources related to the matter say: The rumors of Yantai's abandonment are an overly sensitive observation. Unless necessary, the National Army will definitely ensure the port. The proactive abandonment of Fushan on the 7th was a necessary measure to concentrate forces and consolidate the Yantai defense. The removal of military dependents from the front-line area is also a pre-determined measure, and has been mostly completed by ship to Qingdao in the past two days. The central financial institutions have also been safely relocated to Qingdao. The residents of Yantai, sensing the sudden tightening of the situation, are mostly leaving Yantai for Tianjin and Qingdao. The outskirts are calm, with only minor skirmishes. Dozens of warships are concentrated in the port, preparing to transport organizational personnel and strengthen defenses. Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing once visited Yantai on the Chongqing warship for inspection.</p>

<h3>The Times of London: Reviewing the Overall Situation in China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] The Times of London wrote an article on China's National Day, reviewing the overall situation in China, stating: Achieving national unity and improving the living conditions of the masses are now further away than when the founding father Sun Yat-sen first pointed this out as the nation's highest goal. The report continued: Even if the Communists cannot control all of China, the Chinese government must first implement reforms, and then it can hope that the Chinese masses will concentrate under the government out of patriotic sincerity.

<p>[Report from our Xuzhou Bureau, 12th] Since Wu Huawen defected to the bandits with his troops on September 19, he has been deeply despised by bandit chiefs Chen Yi and Su Yu, who have also made sarcastic remarks to the officers and soldiers of the unit. The officers and soldiers of the unit did not understand the truth when they defected, and only then did they realize that they were trapped. The three regiment commanders of Wu's unit, Wang Yucheng, Wang Tongyu, and Li Desheng, unable to bear the oppression of the bandit army, came to Xu from Qihe (north bank of the Yellow River) this afternoon.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Temporarily Convenes a Closed-Door Meeting: Hearing a Report on the Use of US Aid; Two Proposals to Increase Currency and Stop Robbery Prevention Are Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] The Legislative Yuan held its tenth meeting of the second session on the 12th. However, before the meeting began, reporters who had arrived to observe were abruptly refused entry by the constables guarding the venue. The reporters argued that the agenda and meeting notice did not state that it was a closed-door meeting, and contacted the press room. It was stated that due to considerations by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee, there were many unresolved issues in the use and allocation of US aid, and if they were made public, it might affect loans. Therefore, it was decided to hold a closed-door meeting. Once the US aid issue's report, questions, and answers were completed, the public meeting would begin. The reporters were helpless and could only gather in the lounge waiting. When the recess arrived at around 11:00 AM, the members who went upstairs to rest met the reporters and asked why they had not gone to the venue to report. When they heard that it was a closed-door meeting, they were all surprised and unaware. According to the members, government personnel attending the meeting included Executive Yuan President and US Aid Application Committee Chairman Weng Wenhao, Committee member and Liaison Specialist Yan Jiagan, Secretary-General Shen Xirui, and Foreign Deputy Minister Liu Shishun. First, Weng reported on the evolution of US aid, followed by Yan listing numbers to report on the detailed situation of the use and allocation of US aid since April of this year. Ninety percent of it was old news that had already been published in the newspapers. People became tired of listening. At the end of the report, the venue was already buzzing with chatter. At this point, the reporters felt that the content of the meeting was not at all necessary to be kept secret, and that changing the agenda and holding a closed-door meeting in a regular meeting was not legally compliant because it had not been initiated by a member or proposed by the president for consultation and consent. They directly visited Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan and questioned the reason and expressed their protest. Zhang initially told them that the reporting content had been agreed upon by President Weng to be published in full. As for the closed-door meeting, it was the opinion of the Executive Yuan and a decision agreed upon with the Legislative Yuan. The reporters still argued that since the report could be fully disclosed, why change to a closed-door meeting and requested Zhang to inquire with President Weng for an answer. After President Weng and President Sun consulted, it was decided to resume the public meeting. Zhang also said when answering the reporters that he himself was most opposed to closed-door meetings. President Sun also surprisingly asked why change to a closed-door meeting during the meeting, and his words were quite apologetic, and he repeatedly apologized to the reporters. The reporters, having achieved their goal, said goodbye to Zhang and entered the venue to work. From 11:30 AM to 12:10 PM, approximately a dozen people raised written or oral questions, mostly focusing on the fairness of the allocation in various regions and the efficiency of seasonal use. After a measurement, President Weng requested that they be answered in writing and the meeting was adjourned. The regular meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, with President Sun still presiding. The reporting items listed on the agenda had already been completed in the morning's closed-door meeting, so the discussion items began. The first proposal was the proposal by Shen   Yu and others to supplement the method of stabilizing the value of gold yuan currency "to enhance the credibility of the currency system and benefit implementation" (see this newspaper on August 8 for the main points of the content). More than a dozen members spoke, all expressing their agreement in principle to the proposal, but some held amendment and reservation opinions on certain details. The main points were approximately: (1) Item (b) "Increasing Production" in the proposed method was too brief and should be supplemented and emphasized. (2) To stabilize prices and maintain currency credibility, we should "fight tigers" and "borrow heads". (3) There is no need to expand the Gold Yuan Currency Issuance Supervision Committee. (4) All finances should be made public, and a method of issuing public bonds and compelling wealthy households to subscribe should be determined to make up for the deficit budget, avoid inflation, and reassure people. (5) The Gold Yuan Currency is a management standard and adopts a 100% reserve system, so the issuance reserve fund should not be used. (6) The exchange price of silver subsidiary coins must be far lower than the metal price of the pure silver they contain, so there is no need to stop their issuance. The discussion of this proposal lasted for two hours. Finally, it was passed without objection and submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Economic Resources Committee for joint review. The second proposal was the proposal by Liu Shidu and others to prevent panic buying, encourage production, divert surplus funds, promote national employment, enrich products, stabilize prices, and achieve the actual results of economic reform. After the proposer explained, several members jointly submitted a written opinion, believing that the scope involved in the proposal was too broad and the proposed methods were only empty principles, and advocating that it be reserved. However, after the proposer explained again, the voting result was still to submit it to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Economic Resources Committee for joint review. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM in the afternoon. The economic rationalization bill and other proposals that were not discussed were put on the agenda for the next regular meeting.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department Releases Figures on Military Aid to China: Nearly 90 Million U.S. Dollars Already Transferred to Our Government; Economic Aid Approximately 100 Million U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 11th] The State Department announced on the 11th that since April, military aid funds totaling $88,275,170 have been transferred to the Chinese government. This amount represents 75% of the $125,000,000 in military aid to China approved by the 80th Congress. The State Department's estimated figures were revealed in a report to President Truman on aid to China. According to the report, these funds have been used by the Chinese government to purchase guns, ammunition, aircraft, engines, tires, radios, and more.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman announced that in the past six months, food and other economic aid worth $97,908,000 has been shipped to China or is en route, representing a portion of the $275,000,000 in economic aid to China. Goods approved or already shipped to China include wheat, rice, and flour worth $20,028,000; petroleum worth $22,000,000; cotton worth $5,700,000; and fertilizer worth $1,180,000.</p>
<p>The State Department stated that the Chinese government had tentatively designated $87,500,000 for its army, $9,000,000 for its navy, and $28,000,000 for its air force.</p>
<p>The department added that the food shipped to China covers half of the food rations for six major cities, with the other half sourced domestically. The report stated that shortly after the start of the military aid program, China experienced difficulties in obtaining military supplies and requested U.S. assistance. The U.S. is using its own military inventory to supply China, which will be replenished later.</p>
<p>Of the $87,500,000 in aid allocated to the Chinese army, $68,000,000 is for purchasing ammunition, $25,000,000 for purchasing engines, vehicle tires, and explosives, and $4,000,000 for purchasing petroleum. The report also stated that approximately $3,603,000 has been designated by the Chinese Navy Department for purchasing parts, ammunition, and renovating ships transferred to China. The Chinese Air Force has designated half of its $28,000,000 budget for purchasing petroleum, parts, surplus U.S. bombs, and ammunition from the U.S. forces in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Hoffman stated that $203,300,000 of the economic aid to China will be used to purchase essential commodities such as food, fertilizer, petroleum, and cotton. An additional $70,000,000 will be used for production equipment and technical services, with the remaining funds allocated for administrative expenses. The U.S. survey team led by Stuart, requested that a portion of the $70 million be used to supplement the needs of seventeen major railroads, power companies, and other factories. Stuart is still in China to determine how to use the remaining funds for construction aid to China. At the same time, the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction is drafting a long-term plan to improve China's rural economy. The committee will have a fund of $27,500,000 jointly donated by the Economic Cooperation Administration and the Chinese government. Although Hoffman did not list the committee's plans, the projects will include flood control, irrigation, public health, and research to improve seeds and seedlings.</p>
<p>Hoffman concluded that the cotton given to Chinese yarn factories by the Economic Cooperation Administration will be exchanged for yarn and textiles, but only if the yarn factories are allowed to obtain legitimate profits and are prohibited from speculative hoarding. Half of this yarn and textiles will be sold on the market to recover currency and curb currency flooding or bartered for domestic crops, while the other half will be sold abroad to earn foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Chinese Scientists and National Construction – Wishing Success to the Joint Annual Meeting of Ten Scientific Organizations –</h3>
<p>Ten scientific organizations, including the Science Society of China, held a three-day joint annual meeting in the capital and Beiping, which successfully concluded the day before yesterday. Branch annual meetings will follow in Guangzhou and Chengdu. This, along with the Academia Sinica convocation of academicians held half a month ago, is a grand academic event for the nation. Amidst the current turbulent world and unstable national affairs, gathering the wisdom of national experts to engage in scientific nation-building research demonstrates the scientists' dedication to learning, patriotism, and calm, genuine spirit, which is truly admirable. While happily reading the news of the meeting, we would like to wish the joint annual meeting success and look forward to greater progress in the future where Chinese science is more closely coordinated with the cause of national construction.</p>
<p>Modern scientific research in China actually began after the founding of the Republic of China. The Science Society of China was founded in 1914. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's grand plan to build China through science, the "Industrial Plan," was first established between 1920 and 1921. The exhortation to "catch up" and the advocacy of scholars joining forces can be said to be aimed at a common and consistent goal. Unfortunately, due to social inertia and the obstruction of foreign invasions, scientific progress was greatly hindered in the past two decades, leading to heavy sacrifices during the War of Resistance. Post-war chaos has continued to impede the long-awaited recovery of science and industry. This realistic lesson is too serious. The mission of Chinese scientists in the future should undoubtedly be to contribute more and more effectively to the cause of national construction.</p>
<p>The inherent nature of natural science is international, so we often hear talk of "science knows no borders." However, from the perspective of the actual research and effectiveness of modern science, science definitely possesses a national character. Science must first contribute to national construction and the welfare of the people, and then advance to contribute to the happiness of all mankind. China is a great country, but it is also a weak country with backward science. Today, we must not only learn from the pain of the past and realize the absolute necessity of national defense science for the self-defense of modern independent countries, but also draw lessons from the close cooperation between science and politics in various countries of the world, and mobilize the limited number of scientists nationwide to strive towards the grand goal of national construction.</p>
<p>On the opening day of this year's annual meeting of scientific organizations, Honorary President Weng Wenhao, in his speech, called on scientists across the country to cooperate with the government to promote social progress. President Chiang Kai-shek, at the Academia Sinica convocation of academicians, solemnly expressed his expectation that scientists across the country "devote their efforts to national construction." He believes that to build a modernized China "is to build a scientific China." This statement has in fact pointed out the true path of close cooperation between politics and science in the future. The government must make the greatest effort to promote scientific research in the future, and what we earnestly expect from scientists across the country to dedicate themselves to national construction is threefold:</p>
<p>First, scientific specialized research must be coordinated with national construction plans. Scientific research should naturally be comprehensive, and applied science research should not be neglected at the expense of pure science research. However, on the other hand, scholars must pay attention to the current needs of the country, consider the country's construction plans, determine their urgency and importance, and engage in specialized research in various fields to prepare for national use. For example, for the economic construction plan prepared to realize the industrial plan, the technical construction closely related to science that needs to be realized in the plan requires scientific experts from various departments, and they must be entrusted with planning and training, cadres or technicians, to work together to avoid empty talk. Important state-owned industries, as well as convenient civilian industries, all require countless scientists and engineers to study and design. As for the construction of national defense projects, even more highly developed research is needed, and we expect a high degree of contribution from scientists in countless departments. The call that President Chiang made during the war that "national construction must achieve absolute national defense security" and the warning that "without science, there is no national defense; without national defense, there is no nation" are even more worthy of deep understanding and vigorous action by our scientists in today's tense international situation.

<h3>Trial Opens at Nanjing District Court for Case of Leaking Currency Reform Secrets; Defendants Xu and Tao Both Shirk Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The case of Tao Qiming and Xu Baiqi leaking currency reform secrets was tried on the 12th by Xu Bangzhi, chief judge of the criminal division of the Nanjing District Court, with lamps lit in the dark grand courtroom. Supervisors Zhao Xi and Chen Qinghua, and Secretary Zhu Binglin all attended the hearing. Wang Zhaopeng, president of the District Court, and Chief Prosecutor Chen Xianyu also personally attended as observers. Defense attorneys Deng Zijun, Jiang Hairong, Ji Su, and Wang Jian, representing defendants Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming, were summoned to court. The trial opened at 9:05 a.m. and defendant Tao Qiming was questioned until 11:10 a.m., when the court adjourned. The trial resumed at 2:00 p.m. and defendant Xu Baiqi was questioned until 3:45 p.m. The focus of the questioning was on how Xu Baiqi provided confidential information to Tao Qiming, and how Tao flew to Shanghai to instruct his wife, Li Guolan, to sell Yongsha stock. The two defendants mutually, in a way, both coincided and did not coincide in shrugging off responsiblity. Xu Baiqi denied intentionally leaking information to Tao Qiming or conspiring to profit. Tao Qiming pushed the responsibility on his wife, claiming that trading stocks was a regular occurrence for her and not something he had instructed her to do. Tao further claimed that he himself was completely unaware of the currency reform news. Tao, when questioned, wore a silk-lined robe and single trousers, deliberately maintaining a calm demeanor and feigning recollection and contemplation. The judge asked in detail about his family situation and his history of entering school and taking on jobs. Tao replied that although he worked in the Ministry of Finance, he had no relationship with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. The judge asked Tao when Xu Baiqi revealed the news. Tao stated that after he found Xu to ask for leave, Xu immediately said, "You can go." Xu then said that he had been ordered to draft a document suspending operations for banks and money shops nationwide, but only had the month, not the date. "At the time, we were very curious about what this meant, and what the consequences would be. Later, he said that you could go to Shanghai and ask Yuan Yang'an." The judge pressed, "Since Xu Baiqi did not know what it meant and felt curious, why did he ask you to go to Shanghai to ask Yuan Yang'an, an irrelevant person? Isn't that strange? Did Xu Baiqi really have no intention?" Tao said that Xu had no intention, and he denied that Xu had discussed doing stock trading with him. Regarding why he flew to Shanghai at the time, Tao stated that it was to save money. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately visited Yuan Yang'an and informed Yuan about the suspension of operations for banks and money shops nationwide. Tao claimed that Yuan said that this was highly unlikely, and asked, "What does Xu Baiqi want you and me to do?" Tao responded to Yuan, "He didn't say he wanted us to do anything." After about ten minutes of conversation, he returned. The next morning, Tao had not yet gotten out of bed when his wife went out to trade stocks. Tao claimed that he did not order his wife to trade stocks, nor did he himself trade stocks. Trading stocks was a regular occurrence for his wife, and he did not know Li Boqin and others. The judge then rebuked him with Tao's confession at the Criminal Police Team, to which Tao replied, "I hadn't rested for several days at that time, and was really exhausted. I myself didn't know what I was saying." Finally, Tao requested the court to investigate four points: (1) He first met with Xu Baiqi on August 18 to ask for leave, and only then did they talk about the proposed order to suspend operations for banks and money shops nationwide, and that Xu learned of it before Tao. (2) He never ordered his wife to trade stocks or inform her of the news. (3) He never discussed speculation/trading with Yuan Yang'an. He did not know about the currency reform news at all. The court then asked when Tao learned of the currency reform news. Tao replied that it was at 11 p.m. on the 19th when he was returning to Shanghai. He heard about it at a cigarette shop at the train station. Then, the Court stated that the claim that Xu Baiqi did not inform him about the news and that he then went to consult Yuan Yang’an to confirm that he had no knowledge of the news seemed unlikely. At this point, it was 11:20 a.m., and the judge announced an adjournment.</p>
<p>The questioning of Xu Baiqi resumed at 2:00 p.m. Xu looked quite nervous and shrunk back due to the cold. After asking about his age and background, the judge immediately asked about his family situation and his acquaintance with Wang Yunwu. Xu stated, "I became acquainted with Wang Yunwu at the Academia Sinica, and then worked with him at the Commercial Press for about twenty years. I followed Minister Wang to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance." Xu admitted to introducing Tao Qiming to work at the Ministry of Finance, but they did not have a close relationship. At about 12:30 p.m. on August 18, Vice Minister Xu ordered the drafting of three telegrams, one of which was for the suspension of operations for banks and money shops nationwide for three days. At that time, he did not know about the currency reform news. After drafting the document, he encountered Tao Qiming downstairs, who was planning to go to Shanghai, so he told him that he had been ordered to draft a telegram for the suspension of operations for banks and money shops nationwide for three days. He did not know why, so he told Tao to ask Yuan Yang'an after arriving in Shanghai because Yuan was quite knowledgeable and had no other intention. He only later realized that he was wrong. The judge immediately questioned, "Why would you claim that you didn't know the confidential order of the Ministry of Finance and ask Tao to ask Yuan Yang'an, an irrelevant person? That's strange, really strange." Xu claimed, "I was too busy at the time and didn't have time to talk with Tao in detail, so I asked him to go. But I don't know when Tao went to Shanghai, whether by train or plane." Xu added, "The confession at the Criminal Police Team failed to record my meaning, and I was in a state of nervous disorder after being interrogated under fatigue. Those who have not experienced it firsthand cannot know that kind of pain. I am indeed a good person, and I ask the court to consider my situation. If I wanted to profit, why would I ask Tao Qiming to go? I have many acquaintances in Shanghai. Why would I definitely tell him? I hope the court will listen to me. My words are sincere." The judge asked Xu if he knew that Tao was trading stocks. Xu said, "I casually mentioned to Tao in a conversation that I read the anonymous news in the newspapers that someone sold it, saying you went to Shanghai as well, Tao said I did not do stock trading, but my wife had sold two million shares. At that moment, my impression of him was not good. Until he was arrested, the Criminal Police Team asked me to admit that I had discussed doing stock trading with Tao Qiming, and that I told Yuan Yang'an the news in Shanghai. That record is incorrect." At this point, both defendants completely shirked responsibility for the leaking of information. At 3:45 p.m., the investigative court declared the session closed and announced that a date would be set for a further hearing. After the adjournment, Xu Baiqi's daughter handed Xu a velvet coat and said to Xu, "Take care of your health," and left in tears.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Clarifies Questions on Regulations Regarding Adjustment of Capital for Commercial Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 12th dispatch] After the promulgation of the regulations on the adjustment of capital for commercial banks, banks and firms repeatedly inquired the Ministry of Finance about the interpretation of the articles. In order to clarify some questions in the articles, the Ministry of Finance has recently drafted an "Interpretation of the Regulations on the Adjustment of Capital for Commercial Banks," which was promulgated on the 12th. (The original articles were published in the first edition of this newspaper on September 5th, please refer to them.) The full text is as follows: Interpretations of Articles 1 and 2 of the Regulations on the Adjustment of Capital for Commercial Banks are omitted.</p>
<p>Interpretation of Article 3: (1) The minimum capital amount for banks and firms in various regions should be applied uniformly within the same county (regardless of whether their address is located in the county seat or in a township). (2) For trust companies with attached banking departments, the capital amount should be handled in accordance with banking departments with attached trust departments. (3) If more than one branch is established in the same city or county, the additional branches do not need to increase capital in accordance with the one-tenth regulation. (4) If the operating funds of the trust or savings department attached to a bank's branch are allocated by the headquarters trust or savings department, no additional capital is required.</p>
<p>Interpretation of Article 4: (1) If the expenses incurred in increasing the original value or utility of assets due to processing, improvement, or renovation have already been included in asset items such as operating equipment or operating real estate, the prices may be revalued and included in the asset appreciation items for calculation. If they have been included in profit and loss items, they may not be included. (2) If there is a surplus after the asset appreciation, the portion exceeding half of the capital to be increased may be used to supplement the public reserve fund, but it may not be distributed.</p>
<p>Interpretation of Article 5: (1) The "total amount of capital to be increased" referred to in this article refers to the new capital amount proposed by the shareholders' meeting. This new capital amount may exceed but must not be less than the minimum prescribed standard. If the resolution of the shareholders' meeting only increases to the minimum standard, then this "total amount of capital to be increased" refers to the minimum capital amount to be increased. If the resolution of the shareholders' meeting increases capital beyond the prescribed standard, it refers to the amount that the shareholders resolved to increase to. For example: The shareholders resolved to increase the capital to two million gold yuan. 1. If the original asset appreciates to one million gold yuan, then shareholders should still contribute one million gold yuan in cash. 2. If the original asset appreciates to 300,000 gold yuan, then shareholders should still contribute 1.7 million gold yuan in cash. 3. If the original asset appreciates to 1.2 million gold yuan, then shareholders should still contribute one million gold yuan in cash. The surplus of 200,000 gold yuan may be transferred to the public reserve fund, but it may not be distributed. (2) Shareholders may not use property to offset cash payments for increased shares. (3) The newly increased cash capital will be returned three months after each bank or firm deposits it with the Central Bank. The deposit of funds in places where there is no Central Bank will be handled separately by the Ministry in consultation with the Central Bank. (4) If the asset appreciation is still less than half of the capital amount to be increased, the portion of the cash increase to make up half should also be deposited in the Central Bank. (5) If the assets of a bank or firm are adjusted to exceed the standard capital amount, the surplus can be combined with the capital to be increased for setting up branches. In the future, if branches are added within this scope after approval in accordance with regulations, no additional capital is required. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>Three Powers Accuse Soviet Union of Threatening Peace, Will Urge Security Council to Take Action, Mediation Efforts by Neutral Nations Ultimately Fail</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] Paris, 16th broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, along with the Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration Hoffman, and Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, arrived in Paris this morning aboard the presidential plane from New York.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] Paris, 12th broadcast: The United States, Britain, and France have abandoned all attempts to seek compromise with the Soviet Union on lifting the Berlin blockade and have begun to urge the Security Council to take action on the Berlin issue. This coincides with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's return to Paris after talking with President Truman in Washington. The Western powers have been disappointed with the mediation efforts of neutral nations and are now drafting a resolution to lift the Berlin blockade with decisive action. Marshall has just arrived in Paris and has not yet appeared at the United Nations General Assembly, and seems to remain the behind-the-scenes strategist of American policy. The President of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, has also given up all hope of seeking compromise and has begun to look for a solution to the Berlin crisis. After a week-long recess, the Security Council is expected to hold a formal meeting on the 13th, at which time the Western powers will accuse the Soviet Union on three points: (1) In the Security Council, accusing the blockade of Berlin as threatening world peace. Although it is clear that the Soviet Union will use its veto power, it will still insist on accusing the Soviet Union in the Security Council. (2) In the General Assembly, Britain has taken the lead in accusing the Soviet Union of making the world uneasy and the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce armaments by one-third within three years is insincere. (3) In the General Assembly, the West is trying to pass the American atomic energy control plan by an overwhelming majority, thereby accusing the Soviet Union of being the only obstacle to the establishment of a control agency.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] Paris, 12th broadcast: U.S. Representative Austin delivered a speech in the Political Committee of the General Assembly on the 12th, accusing the Soviet Union of obstructing lasting peace, threatening world peace, refusing to cooperate with the United Nations, and undermining the solution to the Berlin crisis. Austin's speech was delivered hours after Marshall returned to Paris from the United States. Well-informed sources said that Austin's fierce attack on the Soviet Union indicated that the Western powers had begun to abandon all attempts at compromise and instead demanded that the Soviet Union be condemned as a threat to world peace. Austin said that Soviet leaders have a major misunderstanding, and they insist that different economic and political systems can coexist, and he called on the United Nations to find ways to eliminate the Soviet Union's misunderstanding. Austin reviewed the United States' military buildup plans, acknowledging that the United States had "reduced its armaments too much and too quickly" after the war. Austin vehemently denounced Vyshinsky's accusation that the United States was "manufacturing war" as a propaganda tactic, and specifically attacked the Soviet Union's proposal for the five major powers of China, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to reduce their military spending by one-third in 1949, calling it malicious. Austin asserted that there could be no talk of disarmament until peace treaties were concluded with Japan and Germany, as these armaments were necessary conditions for safeguarding world peace. Austin then mentioned that the Soviet Union, in the dispute over atomic energy and disarmament, refused to open its territory for the United Nations to investigate whether it was fulfilling its treaties. He said that the Soviet Union had not yet provided assurances that the country was willing to participate in world organizations.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Vyshinsky States Willingness to Disclose Military Strength Details, But Requires West to Provide Same Information, Denounces Warmongers in Red-Faced Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky stated that he is willing to publish the details of his military strength, but the West should also provide the same report at the same time, including weapons such as atomic bombs and germ warfare. The Soviet Union refused to report its three-armed forces to the world before the United States released the truth about its atomic bomb storage "on the table."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] During the afternoon meeting of the Political Committee of the General Assembly on the 12th, Soviet chief representative Vyshinsky delivered a passionate and powerful speech, criticizing that when Western representatives attacked the Soviet Union, "it was like a horse off the reins, breaking all limits." He criticized the "poisonous" remarks of British, American, and French representatives, slandering the Soviet Union and resorting to any means. The West is trying to "sabotage behind the scenes" the Soviet Union's proposal for the five major powers to reduce their troops by one-third within a year. He claimed that there was sufficient evidence to prove that "there are a large number of people in the world who instigate war." Vyshinsky angrily said that Western countries tried to induce Hitler to attack the Soviet Union in 1939. "If you ask me to put my cards on the table," he claimed that he could prove it. Vyshinsky reviewed the disarmament speeches of Western representatives one by one and reprimanded British representative Shawcross for "completely losing his mental balance and his moral concepts are also gone." He scolded the West for trying to obstruct all progress with atomic bombs and refusing to disarm. Vyshinsky spoke for more than an hour, and his wording was unprecedentedly fierce, no less than that of U.S. representative Austin's speech. Vyshinsky still delivered his speech in the style of a prosecutor, his face flushed, jumping non-stop in his chair, waving his hands wildly from side to side, pointing his finger directly at representatives of other countries, and shouting loudly by hitting the table. He often turned around and pointed directly at British representative McNeil behind him. The audience laughed from time to time because of his intense attitude, especially when Vyshinsky mentioned that the Soviet Union did not require Luxembourg to disarm. He spoke for one hour and twenty minutes, and continued to scold endlessly.</p>

<h3>U.S. Accelerates Mobilization Preparations, Expands Security Team into Infantry Divisions and Armored Divisions, Determines New Industrial Militarization Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal will convene leaders from various fields, including the military, industry, the press, education, labor unions, and religion, to discuss how to make U.S. mobilization efforts easier in the event of a necessary time. The meeting is scheduled from November 8th to 10th, and the results of the meeting will be kept strictly confidential. A Department of Defense spokesman said: Due to the deterioration of the international situation, it is necessary to strengthen the connection between various aspects of American activity.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] According to an announcement today, the U.S. Security Team will complete the reorganization of its infantry divisions and armored divisions by the beginning of next year, making its strength equal to that of the regular army. It is revealed that each of the 25 divisions of the Security Team's infantry will add a battalion of automatic anti-aircraft artillery and heavy tank soldiers. For other reforms, each of the two armored divisions will add a battalion of howitzer field artillery and automatic anti-aircraft artillery. According to the announcement, the military strength of the infantry division will increase from 13,000 officers and soldiers to 14,000, and the personnel of the armored division will increase from 9,000 to 12,000.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] U.S. defense officials recently estimated that once a war breaks out, U.S. industry can be converted to munitions production within 18 months. They said that the new plan to convert to military industry has improved the methods of World War II a lot, greatly shortening the period of production change. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff estimate that the preparation time for future national "overall" operations will be extremely short. In order to cope with threats, the department has requested the National Security Resources Board and the Munitions Board to plan a plan to accelerate national production. The Munitions Bureau has already planned to accumulate strategic materials worth 2 billion yuan and store a large number of production tools in underground warehouses. In addition, it is also planned: (1) Standardization of materials purchased by the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (2) Research and control of transportation, manpower, electricity, and other services; (3) Decentralization of industry so that the national industrial potential will not be damaged when bombed.</p>

This will be the second time the Soviet Union has lifted the blockade. According to the first time, German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union returned home, and the train was supplied by the Soviet side, equipped by the English, and staffed to preside over it. It will depart from the Western District and enter Berlin on Saturday.</p>
<h3>French Government Drafts Plan to Prevent Communist Rebellion, 100,000 Elite Troops Wait for Orders on the Outskirts of Paris</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] A confidential report on the 11th stated: The French government has drafted a detailed plan to automatically control Paris as a whole within an hour in the event of an armed rebellion to prevent the rebels from seizing the capital. A special police team of 100,000 people has been specially trained to deal with the Communist Party. The person in charge is Minister of the Interior Moch, who deeply hates both the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction. The report said that if the French government is threatened, regardless of whether it comes from the far left or the far right, the plan will be implemented. It is reported that the plan has been changed since the Communist Party presided over the big strike in November last year. It is confident in the current labor unrest initiated by 315,000 miners and has countermeasures to deal with it. According to the traditional location of rebellions in France, Paris is the center, so the purpose of the plan is that in addition to the rebels occupying the strategic military points of the capital, the government forces will take the initiative to occupy them. During the crisis before the rebellion, the troops temporarily registered in the suburbs of Paris, and this method was used in November last year. The troops are highly motorized and can drive into the capital from Versailles, Saint-Germain, and other garrison towns in half an hour in the event of an emergency. The police in the city are on standby. According to the above-mentioned report, the military and police can control the following strategic military points: the Police Headquarters, the President's residence, the Ministry of the Interior, the City Hall, the General Radio Station, the Ministry of the Army, the railway station, and the electrical union. The government believes that once the above-mentioned nerve center is in hand, it can quickly quell the rebellion. If the rebels are lightly armed, they can be captured in one fell swoop. The elite troops ordered to suppress the rebellion are said to be the battle-hardened Second Armored Division and the rifle teams of North Africa and Senegal. In the past two years, several underground military arsenals have been uncovered and a large number of heavy weapons have been obtained, and it is believed that the rebels can only fight with rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades at most. As for heavy weapons and aircraft, they are all under the control of the government. If the rebels unexpectedly launch a riot, the government forces only need to be able to control the initial situation to break all armed revolutions of the puppet regime.</p>
<h3>Hoffman Arrives in France to Confer with British and French Authorities on German Reparations Issues</h3>

ECA personnel said that he intends to reach a final agreement with the British and French governments on the issue of German reparations and the dismantling of factories. Marshall, Bevin, and Schumann recently discussed the issue of reparations and Qian Xin had reached an agreement.

Congress has long authorized Hoffman that if he believes that reducing reparations and transportation will benefit the entire Europe, he can reduce the amount of compensation transferred from the British occupied area.</p>

<h3>With Yoshida Shigeru Organizing a New Cabinet, Japanese Political Parties Have Different Opinions, The Liberal Party is Still Not Sure of Nominating the Prime Minister Today</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Japanese House of Representatives convened a House Steering Committee at 5:00 pm on the 12th to discuss matters concerning the nomination and election of the Prime Minister. During the session, the Democratic Party first stated: "If the Liberal Party organizes a national unity cabinet, then we will cooperate. Our party's decision in this direction has already been notified to the party, and after receiving a reply, the highest-level cadres' meeting will decide on the attitude. Therefore, we hope that the nomination election will be postponed until tomorrow." Then the representative of the Liberal Party said: "The Democratic Party's proposal has some points that need to be reviewed, so our party also hopes to postpone the nomination election for one day." As a result, the nomination election will be changed to the afternoon of the 13th.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The changes in the Japanese political situation have now entered a chaotic stage. In addition to the Liberal Party actively preparing for the upcoming Prime Minister nomination election, most other political parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The Liberal Party still has difficulties in the future Prime Minister nomination and cabinet formation work. As of now, the attitudes of various political parties are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Democratic Party is now exchanging the issue of a national unity cabinet with the nomination of Yoshida. Otherwise, the party will cast blank votes in the Prime Minister nomination election. The party is roughly divided into three factions: one faction advocates immediate resignation, one faction advocates resigning after Yoshida is elected, and the other faction advocates cooperating with Yoshida if Yoshida agrees to form a national unity cabinet; otherwise, resigning.</p>
<p>(2) Because the Socialist Party once advocated a united conservative front excluding the Socialist Party, there is still no possibility of compromise between the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party. Therefore, the party has decided to nominate Katayama as a candidate for the next Prime Minister.</p>
<p>(3) The National Cooperative Party now separates the Prime Minister's nomination from joining the new cabinet as two distinct matters. It is rumored that this is the result of MacArthur's hint. The party will still consider the policies proposed by the Liberal Party before deciding whether to join the new cabinet. In addition, the Social Reform Party, the Farmers' Party, and the First Members' Club have decided to support Yoshida, while the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party have decided to nominate Kuroda Hisao as a candidate for the next Prime Minister.</p>

<p>[US News Agency, Paris, 11th] UN Secretary-General Lai Yi stated today that war will not occur in the "foreseeable future." He made this statement in response to an inquiry from a newly published newspaper in the United States, which had also sought opinions from other world figures on this issue.

He continued, "In principle, major powers may often have conflicts that lead to a third world war, but if the nations of the world possess even a little common sense and exercise the most basic instinct of self-preservation, war will definitely not occur."</p>

The first discussion meeting was held at 4 p.m., and those invited to attend were responsible persons and representatives of major stores and companies in Taipei City, including Guo Linshuang (Wing On Company), Sun Yu (Wing Loong Company), Zhang Fuzhong (Five Continents Pharmacy), Yang Xuanqing (Lao Jiu He), Fu Liangjun (New Light Underwear), Gu Jun (Yi Chang Woolen Fabrics and Department Store), Zhang Yiping (Heng Yuan Xiang), Zhang Changhong (Warrior Rubber Company), Zhang Deqian (Mao Chang Glasses Company), Cen Zong (Xu Chongdao Pharmacy), Zhou Huaikong (De Tu Gu Company), Mo Gaoming (Ting Dali), and more than a dozen others. The representatives expressed their difficulties with one voice, stating that the amount of goods allocated by manufacturers was scarce, and after the rush buying spree, the stock of materials was reduced, making it difficult to meet market needs. Rationed shopping is theoretically feasible, but technically very difficult. After listening to the representatives' opinions, Mr. Jiang stated that the fundamental solution is to increase production. The supply of raw materials can now be considered worry-free, and it is expected that the supply of goods in stores can return to normal in one and a half months. He also instructed the representatives to strictly adhere to the price limits, assist the government in implementing policies, and stabilize prices. At 6 p.m., Mr. Jiang invited representatives of manufacturers to talk. Representatives from various industries, including Du Yuesheng, Chen Qicai, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Hong Nianzu, He Liren, Cheng Nianpeng, and more than a dozen others, attended. The central topic of discussion was still the issue of raw materials. The difficulties stated by the representatives were largely the same as those reported in the past. There was also an exchange of views on the industrial raw material supply measures passed by the Materials Adjustment Committee. The discussion lasted for more than an hour. At 7:30 p.m., Chamber of Commerce representatives Xu Jiyi, Du Yuesheng, Ge Jechen, Jin Runxiang, and Yan Esheng visited Border Affairs Supervisor Jiang to offer several opinions on the general commercial situation in the city. The representatives pointed out that there are currently several abnormal phenomena, such as the difficulty in buying vegetables, the lack of coal and paper, and the reappearance of the black market for gold notes, and requested that the authorities pay attention to them so that they can be remedied as soon as possible. Mr. Jiang stated that the shortage of materials has already been noted, and efforts are being made to alleviate it. The rush buying spree was caused by the temporary psychological panic of the citizens and is now subsiding. Management work is being gradually strengthened, and in time, it will be effective. Finally, he hoped that the representatives would assist the government and strive to maintain the "August 19" price limits. The discussion meeting ended at around 8 p.m.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Materials Adjustment Committee: Total Monthly Allocation of Yarn for Replication Industry Limited to 30,000 Pieces; Adjustment Committee Decides to Establish Three Subgroups: Industrial Raw Materials, etc.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee held its seventh meeting at the Central Bank conference room yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., chaired by Liu Gongyun. The supply of industrial raw materials and the adjustment of daily necessities were discussed in detail, and the following important resolutions were made: (1) The industrial raw material supply measures submitted by the Industrial Raw Materials Subgroup Review Committee were revised and approved. (2) The total amount of yarn allocated to the replication industry in this district shall be limited to 24,000 to 30,000 pieces per month. Before a unified yarn purchase and allocation method is determined, the Textile Construction Company and private yarn factories will continue to allocate yarn. (3) To facilitate the work, the Adjustment Committee decided to establish three subgroups: industrial raw materials, daily necessities, and fuel, to be responsible for handling review, allocation, and adjustment matters. (4) The Shanghai District Grain Exchange and Storage Method drafted by the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee was approved in principle and allowed to be implemented on a trial basis.</p>
<h3>Supply of Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>1.  Industrial raw materials should be divided into the following categories according to the source of supply: (A) all supplied domestically, (B) all supplied from abroad, and (C) part supplied domestically, but the insufficient part still needs to be supplied from abroad, in order to facilitate the planning of supply and allocation. 2. For raw materials supplied domestically, (A) those with special management agencies shall be managed by the special management agencies; (B) those without special management agencies shall be supplied by the trade associations; and (C) those without special management agencies and trade associations shall be purchased by the Central Trust Bureau through consultation.</p>
<p>2.  Raw materials supplied from abroad. The principle should be to minimize the increase in government foreign exchange expenditure, and the Import and Export Management Committee should complete the allocation procedures for the fifth and sixth seasons as soon as possible to facilitate import.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the allocation issue, except for cotton, fuel, and imported raw materials, which all have special management agencies, the remaining raw materials that do not have allocation agencies are proposed to be collected by the Industrial Association, which will formulate allocation methods and submit them to the Materials Adjustment Committee for approval by the Economic Control Supervisor.</p>
<p>4.  Although each allocation agency has its own affiliation, for the sake of unified adjustment, it is necessary to report the production, sales, and inventory numbers of each material to the Materials Adjustment Committee on a regular basis so as to understand the overall situation. The forms for this regular filling and reporting are proposed to be negotiated by the secretary of this committee and the relevant agencies.</p>
<p>5.  The amount of raw materials currently held by each manufacturer should be clarified, and the registration should be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Knitting Small Factories Request Allocation of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The small knitting factories in this city are subject to the government's rationing system, and all yarn is allocated by the government. However, these small factories are limited by the articles of association of the trade association and are not entitled to allocation rights. Therefore, more than 300 small manufacturers have jointly submitted a document to the Supervisory Office, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the China Textile Corporation, requesting that small factories be allowed to apply for registration and allocation of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Second Registration of Daily Necessities Starts Tomorrow: Completed in One Week</h3>

<h3>Applications for Rice Purchases by Various Agencies Must Indicate License Number</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau allows factories, companies, banks, and other business institutions to apply for purchase certificates from the bureau to purchase rice directly from rice-producing areas. The bureau recently stipulated that when applying, factories, companies, etc., must indicate the business registration license number issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or the Social Affairs Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Materials Adjustment Committee Chairman Comes to Shanghai for Official Business</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Materials Adjustment Committee, has come to Shanghai for many days to discuss economic construction matters in Zhejiang Province and has held several discussions with responsible persons of the Central Bank and the US Aid Utilization Committee. Mr. Ren plans to establish ten factories producing essential goods for people's livelihood in Zhejiang Province.

<h3>Personnel of the Fuel Management Committee Accused of Corruption: Sun Jice et al. to Be Publicly Tried Today; More Than Forty Witnesses Summoned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Jice, former director of the Distribution Department of the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee (later transferred to director of the Coal Adjustment and Supply Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce), and Lin Keying, chief of the Business Section of the department, are jointly accused of extorting bribes from merchants and engaging in corrupt practices by taking advantage of their positions. The municipal government has previously transferred the defendants and all case files to the District Court for detention. Judge Xie Zhiying is scheduled to conduct the initial trial in the Eighth Criminal Division of the court at 9 a.m. today, and more than 40 relevant witnesses have been summoned to appear in court. It is reported that Sun et al. are accused of deliberately suppressing applications from merchants to purchase coal and unreasonably reducing their allocations while serving in the department.</p>
<p>They would solicit bribes from merchants before agreeing to increase their allocations, or resell the surplus coal on the black market and share the profits. It is also known that the allocated coal was mostly handed over to Han Chengpu, the owner of Jianhua Coal Company at No. 20, Lane 850, Beijing Road, in this city, for resale on the black market. Han Chengpu was previously questioned in the corruption case of Yang Yunfu, director of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee. After the Municipal Police Bureau summoned Sun Jice, Lin Keying, and the persons in charge of Huaguang Coal Company, Shenhu United Business Office, Songjiang Electric Company, and various shipping companies, it was discovered that the Distribution Department and the Transportation Department had engaged in</p>
<p>very detailed corrupt practices. The Fuel Management Committee has regulations on the allocation of coal to various shipping companies and factories in the city that need coal. Applicants for coal allocation must fill out a coal consumption form, which must be certified by the trade association and submitted to the committee for investigation and verification. The allocation work is handled by the Distribution Department of the committee. After Xu Letian, the former chairman of the committee, left his post and Zhang Xiwei was appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over (Zhang took office in June of the sixth year), Sun Jice also followed Zhang to serve as the director of the Distribution Department of the committee. Sun and Lin Keying, chief of the section, saw that the allocated coal price of the committee was very different from the market price, and the allocated price was much lower than the black market price. Therefore, they solicited bribes from shipping companies and factories applying for coal allocation. Merchants who colluded with the department had their coal allocation increased, even exceeding their actual consumption by more than one time. Even business firms that had already ceased operations could still be allocated a large amount of coal every month without the certification of the trade association and the investigation of the committee. The recipients of the allocation directly sold the warehouse warrants issued by the committee on the black market,</p>
<p>and the profits obtained (i.e., the difference between the allocated price and the black market price) were divided, with 40% going to the Distribution Department and 60% to the allocating merchants. Some of them jointly sent representatives to contact the Distribution Department, and some individually contacted the Distribution Department. After the District Court opens the trial today, the full details of the case will be known.</p>
<h3>One Underground Bank Investigated and Ordered to Close: Xincheng Commercial Firm Also Fined 5,000 Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Gold Control Bureau announced yesterday that it had cracked down on an underground bank. It is reported that Xincheng Commercial Firm, located at No. 19, Dexin Lane, Lane 324, Nanjing East Road, originally engaged in the grain business. After the bureau conducted two investigations on the 17th of last month and the 1st of this month, it was found that the commercial firm had more than 120 customers and frequently received and paid cash. The account books and telegrams also stated the collection and payment of remittance fees and interest, as well as the collection of commissions for out-of-town customers' foreign exchange transactions. After investigation, most of the funds in the loan items were not necessary for the business, and a "cart force" item was established to replace the commission, conceal income, and evade taxes. In addition to the tax evasion part, which has been referred to the Direct Tax Bureau for investigation, the commercial firm's operation of an underground bank is proven to be true. The bureau has reported it to the Supervisor's Office for approval and ordered the commercial firm to cease operations in accordance with Article 15 of the Banking Law and imposed a fine of 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Control Prices in Production Areas: Formulate Concrete Plans; Strive to Restore Standards Before August 19</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the rush buying spree in this city gradually subsided, it was learned from relevant sources that some merchants are still breaking through the August 19 price limit and using various illegal acts to deal with the government's control policies with the black market and underground warehouses.

<h3>Fish Market Dispute: Meeting to Be Held Today to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, disputes have arisen between the brokers and fish vendors in the fish market in this city over the allocation system. The two sides have published advertisements in the newspapers attacking each other. The Yufan Tongren Lianyihui (Fish Vendor Association) requested that each vegetable market in the city be assigned three representatives by the association to allocate fish to the three representatives on a daily basis when the fish arrive, and then re-allocate them to the fish vendors. The brokers insisted that each fish vendor must individually go to the market to purchase the fish. The fish vendors then exposed the black market insiders, such as brokers exploiting illegal profits in the middle, colluding with scalpers to manipulate fish prices and monopolize the market. In order to resolve this dispute, the general manager of the fish market will convene a joint meeting of the Yufan Tongren Lianyihui, the Fish Wheel Industry Association, the Seafood Sales Association, and the Broker Association this afternoon to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3>Shanbaohui's Top House Case: Wasted More Than 10 Billion Public Funds; Investigation by the Supervisory Committee and Administrative Office Completed; Involving Multiple Senior Officials</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Supervisory Committee and Administrative Office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Districts received a secret report in mid-month accusing the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Enterprise of collective corruption. The Supervisory Office immediately sent personnel to investigate. Over the past three weeks, the investigation has come to a close, and it is heard that considerable gains have been made, and all kinds of evidence have been collected. The personnel in charge of the investigation are now drafting a report and submitting it to the Control Yuan. According to the reporter's investigation from various relevant parties, the content of this case is very broad. The main points are that a large number of senior officials of the committee have privately used public funds to buy houses as private residences. The purchase fees are all valued in gold bars, ranging from twenty to thirty bars for those with higher positions and more than ten bars for those with lower positions, depending on the position and size of the residence. At the same time, after buying the house, they are allowed to reimburse the repair costs, which is also a big deal. It is also learned that the total public funds spent on buying houses is about 200 gold bars, or more than 150 billion legal currency. The source of this fund is the sale of 160,000 bales of cotton yarn held in custody by the committee (one saying it is only a part, because the committee controls a huge amount of materials, including 160,000 bales of cotton yarn and 5 million US dollars, which can be freely disposed of). The personnel involved in this case include Xiang Jingyun, director of the Secretariat of the Committee, Li Ming, the person in charge of the Finance Committee, and employees Chen Hongduo, Gao Qingshou, and others.</p>

<p>Facts of the Crime</p>
<p>According to the facts of the crime stated in the judgment against Yang Guangming and others: "Yang Guangming, a coppersmith at Shenxin No. 9 Factory, joined the Communist Party in Chongqing in the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945] through the introduction of Guo Chuhuai. In June of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], he started working at the Shenxin Factory and was under the command of Communist Party member Wang Yiming. On January 30th of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948], at 12:30 PM, under the guise of requesting coal briquettes and advance salary, he shut down the power supply and implemented a factory-wide strike. On the same day, he organized pickets and propaganda teams, assigned duties, and dispatched people to guard the four factory gates, prohibiting all workers, staff, and the factory manager from entering or leaving. The general representative then presented nine demands to the factory. The factory deemed the demands excessive and no agreement was reached. The defendant gathered all the workers to report on the negotiation situation, and at the same time, the defendant Wu Shizhen was assigned to supervise workers moving stones and iron bars to the third floor. When the military police broke the locks and entered to persuade them to stop, the workers threw the stones and iron bars down, causing great disorder and injuries and deaths to police and workers. After the strike, the defendant Yang Changmin served as the chief of the picket team and general commander, posting notices prohibiting anyone from leaving, issuing armbands for the pickets to wear, and monitoring the actions of important personnel. All notices and armbands were stamped with Yang's personal seal to be effective. The defendants Miao Xinggen and others served as squad leaders, using megaphones to prevent workers from entering or leaving. Fan Jinnan managed the opening and closing of the iron gates. Wu Shizhen shouted unity slogans and supervised the moving of stones and iron bars to the third floor. Leng Tonggen and others, under the instructions of the fugitive Jie Huaiqiong, dressed up and performed plays, satirizing capitalists and inciting struggle. The remaining 21 defendants, including Ma Lianzhong, either participated in the riot or assisted in the situation, which they all confessed to. Wu Baoliang and the other nine were acquitted due to insufficient evidence."</p>

<h3>Inspection of Man Kam To Customs Post After Signing of Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent of this newspaper</p>
<p>[Dispatch by air from Hong Kong on the 9th from our newspaper] The day after signing the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement, the reporter made a special trip to the Man Kam To Customs Post on the Sino-British border to inspect it. I took a train from Kowloon to Sheung Shui station, and then transferred to a public bus, which took about ten minutes to reach Man Kam To. It takes about half an hour to walk through the Man Kam To Customs Post to reach Shenzhen Market. Although the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has a Shenzhen station, it is quite far from the market town, so most of the "single carriers" traveling between Shenzhen and Kowloon pass through Man Kam To. When the East River Communists captured Shatoujiao in Paya Bay a month ago, Man Kam To was the only customs post that stood alone on the Sino-British border, which shows its importance.</p>
<p>Inspection of Travelers and Vehicles</p>
<p>After getting off the bus at Man Kam To station, turn a small corner to reach the Man Kam To Bridge. There is a British police station on the bridge, with police officers guarding it with guns. Travelers and vehicles must be inspected here before passing through. After crossing the bridge and walking about a hundred steps, you arrive at Man Kam To. The customs post is on the Chinese side of the bridge embankment, with two Chinese military police guarding it, behaving calmly, unlike the British police's "air of importance." According to Man Kam To customs officials, villagers in the nearby area carry small amounts of grain to the British side, making multiple trips back and forth every day. However, once his or her true identity is recognized, he or she is no longer allowed to leave the customs post. Large-scale smuggling only takes place at night, passing through the mountain paths, and never through the main road of the customs post. The reporter stayed at the customs post for half an hour and witnessed dozens of villagers being inspected, as well as seven trucks. Customs officers were lenient in dealing with villagers who transported small amounts of grain to make a living. Therefore, the bus station in British Man Kam To was piled high with bags of rice and other grains. It is said that the rice and grain can be sold for double the price in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Import and Export Department also set up an anti-smuggling station half a mile outside of Sheung Shui. The target of Hong Kong's anti-smuggling efforts is mainly tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>Jeeps of the Chinese Customs are frequently speeding on the road from Sheung Shui to Man Kam To. This "freedom" is said to be a gift of the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement.</p>
<h3>Unsmooth Supply of Goods in Various Places; Appeal to Dredge Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from Jinshan on the 11th from our newspaper] Goods sold by merchants in this county are purchased from Shanghai. Since the price controls, due to Shanghai's prohibition of shipments out, daily necessities have become increasingly scarce, and most merchants are closing early, resulting in a depressed market. The county government has telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Economic Supervision Office to request solutions to improve the supply of goods.</p>
<p>[Report from Fengxian on the 11th from our newspaper] The county chamber of commerce reported that the retail goods sold by merchants in this county are purchased from Shanghai. However, since Shanghai restricted the movement of goods, the source of all goods has suddenly become a problem, and the balance between supply and demand has been lost. The county chamber of commerce held a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 10th and decided to request the county government to seek ways to dredge the supply of goods.</p>

<h3>Chinese Scientists and National Construction Continued from page two</h3>
<p>The second is to improve scientific knowledge through science center education: In scientifically backward countries, scientists, while engaged in specialized research, must also take on the dual responsibilities of popularizing science and cultivating future generations. These two aspects must be equally emphasized in China today. Today, most of China's scientists, except for a few who are engaged in research in research institutions, also bear the responsibility of teaching in secondary schools and above. The discussions at this joint annual meeting placed great emphasis on the popularization and improvement of science education, and paid attention to the science equipment and teaching materials in primary and secondary schools, which is reasonable and gratifying. Due to the destruction of eight years of war, the scientific equipment or factories of universities and vocational schools that meet standards are already rare. Even fewer secondary schools have a set of physics and chemistry instruments, let alone primary schools. In the expenses of schools at all levels, 80 to 90 percent are used for salaries, and equipment fees are extremely limited. In the future, the government should earnestly correct this mistake, and science teachers in schools must base themselves on this goal and provide multi-faceted supervision and assistance. Social education is not an isolated undertaking, but can make up for the inadequacy of equipment in primary and secondary schools. For example, a more complete collection of biological specimens in a museum, and a rich collection of science books in a large library are both sharp weapons of science education. As for the student movements that hinder research and stability and manifest themselves in coercion or strikes, the realistic lessons of the past year in destroying education and science are serious enough! Even if professors and scholars cannot see through their internal conspiracies, they should earnestly prevent and stop them for the sake of the future of science and their own responsibilities, not to mention</p>
<p>Third, transform academic and social customs with scientific and rational thinking: The cause of national construction has countless aspects. Scientists dedicate themselves to national construction through specialized research, and cultivate future generations and improve general scientific knowledge through science education, but his most universal and most fundamental contribution to national construction can be said to be another big one: that is, the transformation of anti-scientific thinking and the construction of a scientific psychology, thereby leading the academic atmosphere and social customs. Mr. Lu Yu Dao wrote a paper for the joint annual meeting, saying that the greatest characteristic of science is "continuous progress" in thought, rejecting old traditions and emphasizing "seeking the truth," and organization and cooperation in realization, rejecting chaos and emphasizing planning. We are very sympathetic. However, what Mr. Lu denounces seems to be more of the conservative old forces, while what we do not understand and are heartbroken about today is the vast number of intellectuals, especially the wandering youth, because unfortunately, their psychological and behavioral manifestations are often anti-scientific. The value of science lies in seeking the truth and advocating reason,——anti-dogmatism, anti-doctrine, anti-blind following. However, in terms of the atmosphere of universities in recent years, some are young people who practice doctrine, some are young people who are indecisive and echo blindly, and there are also many students whose minds are disturbed, whose wills are threatened, and who cannot say anything. Scientific thought trains individuals to distinguish right from wrong, but many universities have coercive student groups that force people to follow blindly, and even resort to violence. Science is achieved through the accumulation of bits and pieces, requiring patience and perseverance, but they only praise the atmosphere of superficial sampling and simulation, despise research and mechanics, and even use strikes to coerce as a means at any time. This kind of atmosphere and propaganda affects people's hearts, making the education field and the general society filled with a kind of empty, shallow, gullible, and blind-following custom. And the most unfortunate thing is that the professors with specialized attainments "can be deceived by their methods" are very indifferent to this situation, and do not come out to speak and correct it with the basic principles of science (seeking progress, anti-chaos). Scholars were initially deceived into thinking that they should be detached and self-sustaining, and finally succumbed to the anti-scientific atmosphere under the coercion of students, not to mention that their research work and teaching were severely frustrated. Here, we are not discussing the current situation from a political standpoint, but only analyzing the pros and cons from the standpoint of education or science. We deeply feel that the recent questioning of suspected students by the authorities must be prudent and legal. However, judging from the actions of destroying academic research caused by indulgence in some universities in the past one or two years, its impact on the atmosphere of primary and secondary schools and society is so bad that it is enough to "arrive at the same destination by different routes" as the stubborn feudal old forces to hinder the growth and progress of the tender seedlings of science!</p>
<p>In short, once this anti-scientific psychology and atmosphere are not eliminated, it will make the efforts of specialized research and science education futile, not to mention establishing a "national construction atmosphere." Therefore, today's scientists can ignore politics, but they cannot ignore the destruction of science by anti-scientific forces. We love the truth and love the country. The fundamental plan is to boldly expose the conspiracies against science and against the country, and strive to build a scientific psychology that loves the truth and loves people. By shifting social customs in this way, specialized research can dedicate itself to construction, and science education can cultivate future generations, so that they can have the progress of catching up. This should be the sacred mission of Chinese scientists to national construction today.</p>

<p>(1) When exporters fill out the export exchange settlement certificate application form, they should meet the following conditions before designated banks can issue the certificate: (1) The export value complies with the latest price limit list stipulated by the Import and Export Management Committee. If the goods are not listed in the aforementioned price limit list, the designated bank should request the submission of a letter of credit, a genuine order contract, or relevant correspondence and other documents to verify that the export value is indeed equal to the applied amount. (2) The foreign currency categories reported for the export value comply with the provisions of this bank's Circular No. 125. (3) All foreign exchange for the export value has been purchased or a purchase agreement has been signed.</p>

<p>(4) For exports to Hong Kong and Macau that are re-exported from those places, an additional copy may be issued upon the exporter's application, with a certificate stating "Special copy for re-export from Hong Kong and Macau." The exporter will request customs to certify it, so that it can be used to apply for inspection and release by the local customs when re-exporting from Hong Kong and Macau in the future. Only one such additional copy is allowed for each batch of exported goods.</p>
<h3>Fifth Meeting of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office Decides on the Start Date for Purchases Personnel Organization of Branches and Stations Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The fifth meeting of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee was held at the National Bank at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Liu Gongyun presided over the meeting. As a result of the discussion, the following key issues were resolved: (1) The personnel organization of the branches, sub-branches, and stations affiliated with the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office has been determined. Each branch will have one manager, two deputy managers, one business director, and two secretaries. The position of manager will be held by personnel from private factories, while the deputy managers and those below will be filled by personnel from the Textile Construction Company. (2) The joint purchasing funds were originally scheduled to be paid two-thirds by the 10th of this month. Now, private factories have stated that their capital turnover is insufficient, so they are allowed to pay one-half first, and the date for paying the remaining one-half will be determined when cotton purchases are needed. (3) The joint purchasing funds currently received include 50 million yuan from the National Bank, 8.8 million yuan from the Textile Construction Company, and 9.4 million yuan from private factories. Foreign factories remitting funds to Shanghai are specifically exempted from collection fees by the National Bank. After consolidating all funds, they will be distributed to various locations in Shanghai for use. Partial remittances have already started yesterday, and purchases will begin on the 16th. (4) The total amount of national cotton to be jointly purchased is set at 3 million dan, and the allocated amounts are roughly as follows: Hankou 900,000 dan, Xi'an 600,000 dan, Shanghai suburbs 400,000 dan, Nantong 350,000 dan, Shashi 250,000 dan, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places 200,000 dan, Tianjin 100,000 dan, Nanjing and Zhengzhou 80,000 dan each, Anqing 40,000 dan. (5) The request from private yarn factories with less than 3,000 spindles to be allowed to make free purchases was not approved. However, if small factories have insufficient funds and are unable to pay the joint purchasing funds, it was decided to allow them to exchange yarn for cotton purchased with the National Bank's funds to maintain the continued production of small factories.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Distribution</h3>
<p>Textile Construction distributed goods yesterday as usual, but the types were fewer than before. Distribution was mostly limited to dyeing factories, retail stores, underwear businesses, parasol businesses, and awning businesses. Wholesale merchants were not allocated this period. The allocated goods and prices are listed below: 3B Dragon Head Fine Cloth, 36-inch width, narrow, limited to retail stores at 18.6 yuan. Secondary Brand 29.5-yard Serge Grey Fabric, limited to dyeing factories at 23.3 yuan. B 30-yard 200-count Yarn Serge Grey Fabric, limited to dyeing factories at 19 yuan. Special 39.5-narrow 12-pound Fine Cloth, limited to dyeing factories at 24.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge, limited to retail stores at 28.3 yuan. Rainbow 42-yard Cloth, limited to underwear and retail stores at 26.8 yuan. Second-grade 30-yard Popular Cloth, limited to retail stores at 18.2 yuan. Jumping Carp Original Color Electric Light Twill, limited to parasol businesses at 16 yuan. Lion Furnace 30-pound 50-yard Canvas, limited to awning businesses at 54 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, American colored cloth 02-K13 colored coarse cloth was distributed at 0.74 yuan per meter, and 016 colored cloth at 0.8 yuan per meter.</p>
<h3>Brisk Sales of Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>Since the secret dealings of cotton cloth brokers in Qingyun Pavilion were investigated and prosecuted, retail cloth stores have continued to see very brisk sales. Therefore, with supply scarce and demand high, many are replenishing their stock from cotton cloth wholesalers, leading to prosperous business for major piece goods wholesalers such as Yongxin Company. Retail merchants are lining up with membership cards and store seals to purchase goods continuously, and the market trend is exceptionally firm.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Discuss Disposal of Stock Yarn</h3>
<p>After trading in the cotton yarn market was suspended, yarn businesses repeatedly requested the authorities to approve the business scope as soon as possible, but no approval has been obtained to date. The industry association held another board of directors meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss (1) urging the Supervisory Office to approve the distribution quota and operating standards for transportation and sales merchants as soon as possible; and (2) the disposal of the cotton yarn in stock after the inventory of yarn stores.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Both Selling Well</h3>
<p>Since the distribution of rayon, trading has become increasingly quiet. Silk weavers are very disinterested, reproduction businesses are still eager to purchase, and silk stores have also seen sluggish retail sales in recent days, with sales becoming stagnant. The association's distribution quota was not even sold out yesterday.</p>
<p>In the raw silk market, foreign firms have seen quiet trading due to the difficulty in purchasing goods for export. Under the price limit, few transactions have been completed. There have been slight transactions in small lots on the local street, with extremely scattered numbers.</p>
<p>Previously, the retail sales of silk and satin on the local street were booming, and goods such as quilt covers were sold out. Recently, foreign firms, lacking raw silk to offer, have switched to handling silk and satin sales, leading to more demand than supply in the market, and the market atmosphere is strong. Due to purchase restrictions in recent days, sales of domestic goods in retail stores have softened slightly. The association is about to start distribution, and factory supplies have decreased.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Retained in Shanghai No Longer Transported to Other Ports</h3>
<p>According to cotton spinning industry sources, many of the inland yarn factories applying for the allocation of American cotton are unable to transport it to their factory locations on time due to transportation issues. Furthermore, after inland manufacturers receive the American cotton, they must hand over the spun cotton yarn to the Shanghai American Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Joint Operating Office. The round-trip transportation is inconvenient and costly. Relevant parties are considering using cotton purchased by the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office in inland areas to offset the American cotton and allocate it to inland manufacturers to save on freight costs. The American cotton retained in Shanghai will be allocated to manufacturers in the Shanghai area as much as possible, spun into cotton yarn locally, and handed over to the American Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Joint Operating Office for unified sales.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply Drastically Reduced</h3>
<p>As winter approaches, coal sales are increasing, but arrivals are becoming scarcer, resulting in very weak inventories among industry members who are unwilling to sell, making purchases extremely difficult. In the past, the local market relied on Kailuan for its coal supply (reaching a maximum of 150,000 tons, just enough for local needs). However, since the Beijing-Ningbo Railway was damaged by bandits, the supply has been drastically reduced. Last month, it was only half the previous amount, and this month it has deteriorated further, with only over 2,000 tons arriving to date. Other ports are also experiencing traffic disruptions due to busy military transport, affecting coal transport, and the coal shortage is becoming increasingly severe. Furthermore, the Smoky Coal Adjustment Supply Office has suddenly been ordered to be abolished, and its affairs will be handled by the National Night Merchants Association, which is currently under preparation. The government will establish a Smoky Sample Adjustment Committee to supervise and review the allocation prices, hoping that the association will be established quickly to avoid interruptions in the future.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Management Committee Submits a Request to the Executive Yuan for a Decision on Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital Imports</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the measures for overseas Chinese assets and overseas Chinese capital to import production equipment, they have not been formally implemented due to the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Order and slight conflicts between some of the detailed rules. The Import and Export Management Committee has drafted revised measures, including the measures for handling imported goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange that has already been paid, and the measures for using foreign currency deposit receipts, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. To date, no instructions have been received. The Import and Export Management Committee, the Supervisory Office, and the Central Bank believe that the daily implementation of these measures would help increase production and stabilize prices, so it has been decided that the Import and Export Management Committee will submit a request to the Executive Yuan for an early decision. It is also heard that Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun has sent a special telegram to Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan, requesting that he intercede on the matter.</p>
<h3>Tea for Export Will Likely Be Less</h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the foreign firm tea market was still sluggish. Because exporters are eager for tea in Europe and Africa, buying interest is still strong, but because production and inventory are both depleted, holders are hesitant, and the trend continues to be one of too many monks and not enough porridge, making it difficult to expand business extensively, and the situation is precarious.</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, a certain trading company in the local market is also planning to add a tea export department soon, and it is expected to be formally established soon. However, given the current scarcity of goods, the company is gradually showing signs of activity in hoarding green tea and other teas in order to plan ahead. If this continues, the future will be even more chaotic. As for domestic tea, there are still more arrivals than sales, and the process is quiet but firm.</p>
<h3>Industrial Association Investigates Raw Materials Needed by Various Industries</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Technical Committee of the Industrial Association, the association is instructing the authorities to investigate the past production quantities and raw material needs of 81 industries in the city to solve the current difficulties. Recently, they have been separately convening industry representatives to conduct intensive research, and it is expected that all materials will be submitted to the Supervisory Office for reference this month.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials for Electroplating Industry Members Purchase Goods with Certificates</h3>
<p>Due to the limited supply of raw materials for the electroplating industry in the city recently, there has been a frenzy of purchasing. To limit purchases, the industry association has entrusted Rissho Changhao and other companies to stipulate that each member can purchase goods with a certificate each time, limited to one dozen of yellow grease, one dozen of white grease, one bag of sand powder, one pound of Kevan, one pound of Van, one pound of rawhide glue, and one piece of leather board every five days (about six to seven pounds). Purchasers are quite enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Secondary Grade Xian Rice Slightly Active Food Rice Likely to Be Slightly Finer Flour and Edible Oil Both Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rice trading was quiet yesterday, and the market in the south of the city was practically closed. White japonica rice was said to be out of stock. Secondary grade Xian rice saw a small amount of trading within limits. Rice stores in the market in the north of the city transported and sold their own rice, selling 607 shi. Rice mills purchased, transported, and sold 250 shi. Arrivals in both markets increased slightly, totaling 1,399 shi. Flour was not opened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was very little trading in coarse grains. Soybeans are about to be re-registered, and it is said that full-scale rationing will be implemented, following the example of edible oil, but this has not yet been confirmed. Yesterday, the market saw scarce arrivals and depleted inventories, with no transactions. There was no trading in red sorghum, corn, mung beans, or peanuts. Only sesame saw some trading on Zhizhi Road. Nanjing white sesame opened at 30 yuan, and Poyang black sesame opened at 28 yuan, with a total of 70 to 80 packages traded. Edible oil was suspended yesterday.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Rice Will Soon Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Another report states that rice arrivals have been scarce, the balance between supply and demand has been lost, and the market is showing signs of having prices but no actual sales. The Economic Supervisory Office summoned the persons in charge of the rice market and the rice industry association, ordering them to be responsible for supplying 250,000 dan of rice to the local market each month. The rice industry association decided that rice merchants would purchase rice from producing areas to meet market needs. It is now learned that since the start, the total amount purchased by rice merchants from various places as of October 8 has reached over 10,000 dan, all of which have been issued purchase permits by the Bureau of Social Affairs, and they will be arriving in the city one after another soon.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Trading in the sugar market was sluggish yesterday, with few chips in the market. Each stall had buyers but no sellers. The local street was extremely interested, but industry members offered very little supply. The trend was firm, but because prices had reached their limits, it was impossible to raise them further. However, there was a lot of speculation, resulting in sluggish trading and scattered transactions.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Retail Price Index Clothing and Other Categories Rise</h3>

<h3>Starting Next Year, Students Must Use National Identity Cards for Rice Rationing</h3>
<p>Private College and Above Presidents Hold a Forum Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A forum for presidents of private colleges and universities in Shanghai was held at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 4:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Haisu, president of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. First, Wang Yukai reported that President Fu Qizhang had contacted the Civil Food Allocation Association regarding students receiving rice rations with certificates. The Civil Food Allocation Association has agreed to postpone the requirement that students must use their national identity cards to receive rice rations until January 1, 1949. Currently, they are still allowed to use the rosters created by the schools to receive rice rations. Subsequently, Ling Xianyong reported that the Sports Committees of public and private colleges and universities have decided to establish six groups for football, basketball, table tennis, track and field, softball, and volleyball, and will first hold competitions this year and plan subsidy methods. For the sake of providing subsidies, all 268 private primary schools with salaries below 40 yuan per month are now planning to hold college and university football, basketball, and table tennis championships at the Fifth District One Center on Friday, the 22nd of this month, at 2:00 PM. The remaining events will be held in the first half of next year. The matters resolved: (1) Recommend Zhu Jingnong and Wang Yukai as representatives to urge the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee on the 15th to decide the allocation quotas for each school and issue the scholarships as soon as possible. (2) Some faculty and students have applied for their national identity cards more than half a year ago and have not yet received them. Now, purchasing daily necessities such as cotton cloth requires a certificate, which is very inconvenient. It was decided that the association will send an official letter to the Civil Affairs Bureau, requesting that it notify its subordinate district offices to issue the national identity cards of the faculty and students of each school as soon as possible. (3) Currently, the Material Supply Bureau and the China Textile Company have special distribution to public school teachers and other personnel. Purchasers line up to buy goods from morning to night, creating great crowding. If the professors of each school must line up to buy goods, they must sacrifice class time, which greatly affects the students' studies. It was decided that the association would submit a request to the Executive Yuan and send a letter to the Material Supply Bureau, requesting that they consider the time difficulties of the professors and allow each school to create a roster, list the goods they need to purchase, prepare funds, and send a staff member from the school to the bureau to purchase the goods at one time to save time.</p>

<h3>World Baseball Championship The Indian Team Wins the Championship Six Games, Four Wins, Two Losses, Bearden's Reputation Soars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 11th] The Cleveland Indians defeated the Boston Braves 4-3 in the sixth game of the World Baseball Championship on the 11th, winning this year's World Championship. The Cleveland team and the Boston team have played a total of six games, with the Cleveland team winning four games and the Boston team winning two games. According to the World Baseball Championship system, the best of seven games is adopted, and the Cleveland team has won four games. The scoring for the sixth game is as follows:</p>
<p>Indians 001002010 4 0</p>
<p>Inning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Total Runs Hits Errors</p>
<p>Braves 000100020 3 9 0</p>
<p>Indians: Pitchers Lemon and Bearden, catcher Hegan.</p>
<p>Braves: Pitchers Fosse and Sain, catcher Salkeld and Marche.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Cleveland Indians defeated the Boston Braves 4-3 again on the 11th, completing the great achievement of four wins and two losses in six games, and winning the 1948 World Baseball Championship. This may bring the most prosperous game in baseball history to a climax. After six major battles, Cleveland's left-handed pitcher, Bearden, leaped to become a baseball hero. On Monday of last week, the Indians and the Boston Red Sox had equal points. Bearden pitched countless wonderful balls in the rematch for the American League championship, defeating the Red Sox and winning the qualification for his team to compete in the World Championship finals. In the third game between the Indians and the Braves, Bearden's left hand once again made the Braves unable to fight back and handed in a blank sheet. In today's game, the Indians' pitcher Lemon was showing signs of decline in the eighth inning. The Indian manager Munder made a desperate bet and transferred Bearden into the game to replace Elmon. Sure enough, the morale of the Braves was taken away, and they could not reverse the defeat.</p>
<p>Although the Braves were defeated, they had the momentum to reverse the situation in the eighth inning. The Braves initially used veteran pitcher Fosse, but the Indians demanded everything, so they transferred left-handed spin shooter Spahn, who won yesterday, to the field. The tired soldiers fought again, and it was really powerful. However, too many points were lost, and they could not recover the situation, and let the Indians fulfill their 28-year-old wish and carry the championship away.</p>

<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Explanation</p>
<h3>Reconciliation Agreement Stipulates No Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Shen Zhang asks:] Some time ago, I had a conflict with a colleague at work due to a misunderstanding. I accidentally injured his face in three places. After mediation by colleagues, I paid for all medical expenses and other losses, and we signed a reconciliation agreement as evidence. Recently, after he recovered and was discharged from the hospital, he suddenly went back on the agreement, claiming that he would sue me. I am not familiar with the law and do not know how to deal with this. I would be grateful if your lawyer could provide some guidance.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin answers:] In cases of mutual assault resulting in injury, if a reconciliation agreement has been signed and the person has affixed their fingerprint, it indicates that they have waived the right to initiate criminal proceedings. If they renege on the agreement and pursue legal action, the prosecutor may invoke Article 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law to issue a decision not to prosecute.</p>

<h3>What is the Most Expensive?</h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>Since the price controls of August 19, what do you say has risen the most?</p>
<p>Almost everything still has some limit; even if it rises a bit, it won't be too much. But there is one thing that is truly "like a prince doing a somersault—out of control!" That is used books.</p>
<p>The used book business has had a few years of bad luck. Since the victory, with a discount of 200%, the price suffered a big setback. Afterwards, because new publications and new works accompanied "new people" and sprung up like mushrooms after rain, old things began to mold. The old antiques on the bookshelves often couldn't recover for two or three years, and no one even asked about them. Moreover, new books were being added at an ever-increasing rate, multiplying by tens or hundreds of thousands of times, making extravagant claims and brooking no argument. Used books had no customers, so how could they do that? Watching the stores selling new books making a lot of money and then also engaging in speculative stocks, some even making a fortune from it, the used bookstore owners still sat on their cold benches every day. How could they not be moved? Therefore, most used bookstores quickly cleared out their inventory and switched to selling new books. Seeing the old tomes and fragrant herbs on the shelves being replaced by newspapers and notebooks, from Feng Yuqi to Mao Dun and Ba Jin, they sold everything, and their cold faces turned into smiling ones. As for how they cleared out their inventory, it was truly miserable. Most were sold by the catty as waste paper. After some sorting, they were resurrected! For a while, even the "Summary of the Complete Books of the Four Treasuries" engraved in Guangdong was weighed by the catty, because selling by weight could earn twice as much as selling by volume! Some stores that were more concerned with culture refused to let the sacred scriptures be destroyed forever and revised their prices. The standard for the revision was also calculated by weight, but in the end, it was not as good as simply weighing them, as they still couldn't be sold. Last winter, because there were too many books being treated this way in Beiping, someone finally spoke up, advocating that the government should invest 10 billion to buy them up to rescue the used book industry. After much clamoring, the Ministry of Education allocated 1 billion, entrusting Peking University with full responsibility for the purchase. Insiders said that this small amount of money could only rescue a drop in the bucket, and the number of used books that were destroyed from then on was simply countless.</p>
<p>No one would have thought that in addition to the five calamities of Niu Hong, there would be this calamity—the resurrection calamity! And this calamity was even more terrible than water, fire, swords, and soldiers. Water, fire, swords, soldiers, insects, and rats are partial and localized, but this was comprehensive and complete. If it continued to develop, all used books might face the fate of destruction. Fortunately, a savior came—the "Gold Yuan Immortal"! From then on, the sea turned into fields again, and used books were resurrected. But this time, the resurrection was too violent. Before, people rejected them from a thousand miles away, but now they reject people from a thousand miles away.</p>
<p>Before August 19, the most expensive used book was no more than 500,000 yuan per volume, and most were around 100,000 yuan, which was equivalent to between 3 cents and 2 jiao in gold yuan. Now, the cheapest book costs at least 5 jiao, and popular ones with good editions cost more than 1 yuan! Before August 19, I went to a used bookstore to buy "Annotations to the History of the Han Dynasty." Eighty books cost only 5 million to 6 million yuan; now, they cost at least 15 yuan! Some ask for as much as 20 yuan. Think about it, hasn't the price increased tenfold? It is said that this is still being polite, and some have increased the price by 20 times at once. Buy it or not! There is no copyright page in old books, so there is no way to talk about fixed prices. If you report them for raising prices, what evidence do you have? So customers can only laugh or cry and are helpless.</p>
<p>According to insiders, this price surge is not entirely due to gouging. Everyone values goods over currency, which is also a reflection of the situation, because recently their colleagues' "auction" prices have also been unreasonably high. (When the book industry buys a batch of used books or a store is willing to sell its inventory, they publicly choose a location for colleagues to bid and trade, which is called auctioning. In the past, they would write the price on a sealed envelope, but now they shout prices like at an auction.) For example, "Yue Mantang's Diary" without supplements has been auctioned for as much as 200 yuan! "Weng Wengong's Diary" also costs about 150 yuan. According to the original price of the books, this is several times higher. (Both books are reproduced by the Commercial Press, with prices between 50 and 40 yuan.) Isn't this too ridiculous? In fact, colleagues are bidding against each other, and they don't necessarily pay immediately. If a customer is willing to pay a reasonable cash price, even if it is slightly lower than the auction price, they can still buy the goods. Isn't this a morbid situation? If it's like this among colleagues, you can imagine what it's like for outsiders.</p>
<p>There are very few used bookstores left in the country now. Outside of the major cities of Beiping, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing, they have almost disappeared. We who deal with old things often have a fear of extinction. The publishing industry in Masha and Jianyang during the Song Dynasty was also very prosperous, but now there is not even a shadow left! The Ming and Qing editions of today are the "rare books" of hundreds of years later, just like how we view the "Song and Yuan" editions today. But booksellers prioritize profit, not culture. The former's weighing and pricing by the catty and the latter's profiteering and exploitation are all acts of destruction! We hope that the authorities will have reasonable measures and management. Otherwise, the future of culture will be somewhat frightening, because the resources of culture will be monopolized!</p>
<h3>Price Increase</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>I don't know if my thinking is too superficial: Chinese people are extremely talented in economics. Although literacy education still needs to be actively promoted, since the birth of the legal tender, there have been very few people who cannot recognize banknotes. Despite the complex patterns and many types of banknotes, vendors, maids, and young ladies can all understand them at a glance. As for converting customs gold to legal tender or legal tender to gold yuan, they are extremely skilled at calculating.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although there are countless people in our society who have not attended school, from wealthy families to small vendors and rickshaw pullers, everyone can recite the law of cost and the law of supply and demand. The conclusion is that price increases are natural and justified, and even though prices have increased, they are still losing money. If we take it a step further, it would be "we will have to close down and worry about unemployment." When big bosses talk about this great principle, they sit upright and look worried. When small vendors complain about how difficult business is, they are serious and concerned. Their expressions and arguments rarely fail to deeply move people.</p>
<p>Not long after the victory, the market was flooded with American goods, and merchants all lamented the sad future of national industry and commerce. Later, imports of American goods were restricted, and domestic goods rose, and factories, stores, wholesalers, and retailers all greatly increased their prices. Let's put the price increase aside for now; they then proceeded to vigorously promote their "selling it means it can't be replenished" law. At first, I was very sympathetic to this statement, but after careful consideration, I felt it was completely wrong. The price at which it was sold this time is the sum of the cost and profit of the last time it was replenished. The next time it is replenished, the selling price will be the same. Moreover, many goods were replenished long ago and sold late, so the profit is known. How can they say that selling it means it can't be replenished? This is as illogical as reversing the cause and effect of prices and indexes.</p>
<p>Therefore, price increases are a common principle in economics, but once human manipulation is skillfully applied, it is difficult to believe that it is justified.</p>
<p>For example: After August 19, many wholesale prices were limited, the prices of firewood, rice, oil, and salt did not move, and the salaries of public utilities and employees were also frozen, but retail stores still thought the price limits were a bit "that way"; for example, pork, not only did the wholesale price not exceed the limit, but the number of pigs slaughtered in September was 10,000 more than in August, but there were still black markets and shortages. In fact, it is because they were used to being left alone. I dare not deny that prices are alive, but it is indeed a fact that the price increases of many things are baseless and without standards. Furthermore, retailers are insiders, and they will never let wholesalers exceed the price limits, but ordinary consumers do not ask for receipts for every item they buy, so although the price limits are said to be strictly enforced, in reality, the retail prices of many things have already changed numbers several times after August 19. In the past few days, authorities have been focusing on the supply of materials, and many bosses are closing their doors with a smile, and "free trade" in the back door, with black prices and white prices, is all up to your discretion. Is business really that difficult?</p>
<p>Let's talk about rickshaws and maids: the former's rental fee is still 1.5 million legal tender per day, but the price of rickshaws has skyrocketed, so rickshaw pullers can now earn 10 yuan in gold certificates per day (many times higher than salaried workers); maids used to be paid with three or four dou of rice, which was very reasonable, but now that the price of rice is not moving, they no longer mention rice, but say that the market price is now 10 yuan or 15 yuan. I have no intention of criticizing the working class, but this situation and this mentality are enough to prove the general situation.</p>
<p>Price increases should not be illegal, but after careful study, they mostly belong to insatiable greed. If this continues, we who have frozen salaries will have to be slaughtered! What to do?</p>

<p>A woman received her salary and was walking home, passing Jiangwan Road, when an elegant man in a Western suit took out a ten-yuan gold certificate and politely asked her, "Do you have two five-yuan bills? Please exchange them for me." The woman was kind-hearted and took out her salary to exchange for him. Unexpectedly, the man took the salary bag and said, "Let me see if there are any one-yuan bills." As he spoke, he flipped through the bills. After counting them one by one, he returned the salary bag to the woman, saying, "Never mind the exchange." With that, he strode away. When the woman got close to home, she felt that something was strange about what had just happened, so she took out the salary bag to check. To her surprise, four five-yuan bills were missing.</p>
<p>She told everyone in the office about this, and everyone who heard it was shocked. At this time, another man told an even more mysterious and astonishing story, which was also his own experience: One afternoon in a certain month last year, he carried two pockets full of banknotes, he didn't remember how much, but it was a large sum of money, enough to buy several stone of white rice. He was passing Nanjing Road, he didn't take the tram, and he didn't bump into anyone, but he didn't know when he was ambushed by criminals, and both pockets were empty. In Shanghai, no one knows how many people are living by this kind of amazing skill (1).</p>
<h3>Luxurious Deception</h3>
<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>The greatest skill of power ministers has always been to deceive the ruler, keeping the person above in the dark so that they can boldly do evil.</p>
<p>Even the shrewd Empress Catherine of Russia was deceived.</p>
<p>In 1787, Marshal Potemkin of Russia reported to Empress Catherine that the newly conquered Crimea was already densely populated and prosperous. The empress was also very sharp. She knew that Crimea was originally a desolate place, and she became suspicious when Potemkin described it so well, so she insisted on seeing it for herself.</p>
<p>A few months later, Potemkin actually invited her to visit Crimea. She gladly accepted and boarded a ship to sail down the Dnieper River for 1,200 miles. Along the way, Potemkin kept pointing things out to her on the deck. She saw crisscrossing fields everywhere, and thriving farmland. The villages were also bustling with happy farmers.</p>
<p>Empress Catherine was very satisfied and did not go ashore. She ordered the anchor to be raised and returned to the Russian capital.</p>
<p>In fact, all of this was fake. The villages and towns were all built with scenery from the theater, and all the farmers were actors hired at a high price. At night, the scenery was immediately dismantled, and the actors rushed to the next section of the road overnight. When the ship arrived the next morning, the banks were bustling again, with a scene of peace and prosperity. The scenery was also set up, and the actors were wandering around again.</p>
<p>The shrewd and capable Catherine did not see through this deception. However, the ambitious Marshal Potemkin also spent a lot of money. At the exchange rate at the time, he spent 4 billion US dollars to rehearse this "play."</p>
<h3>Time Bomb</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>During the intense fighting of World War II, the US intelligence agents did their utmost to protect President Roosevelt's safety. Any gift sent to him had to undergo rigorous inspection before being given to the president. The leader of a South American country had a good relationship with Roosevelt and sent him a lot of food, but the sender was indeed well-intentioned, but German spies poisoned the food halfway through. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and everything was fine. Once, a postal worker suddenly called the police station to report that there was a package addressed to the president with a pendulum sound inside, which was quite suspicious and he wondered if it was a time bomb. Intelligence agents rushed to open it and found that it was indeed a time bomb. Everyone greatly rewarded the postal worker. Unexpectedly, after a few days, the postal worker was sent to a mental hospital by the authorities—</p>
<p>It turned out that after careful investigation by intelligence agents, they discovered that the person who sent the time bomb was actually the postal worker himself! In order to show off, he did not hesitate to violate the law and recklessly take risks. He was originally going to be sentenced, but later it was discovered that he had a mental illness, so he was sent to the hospital to take care of things.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from a Mouse Coming to the Study</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Killing Ministers in Ancient Times</p>
<p>The corruption of rituals lies in teaching people to pretend, from which the idea of pretending as the center produces many rituals in history, which still make us laugh after thousands of years.</p>
<p>For example, in ancient times, killing ministers was considered an unfortunate event. If they had to use criminal punishment, they had to go through many dramatic rituals to imply the class nature of the law, and on the surface, they covered it up with the term "ritual."</p>
<p>In the Han Dynasty: if the prime minister was guilty, the emperor would send someone to hold a scepter and ride a white horse-drawn carriage, bestow cattle and wine, and a basin of water. The envoy would announce the disaster. When the envoy was about to leave, the prime minister would report that he was ill. Halfway through, the Shangshu would report that the prime minister was critically ill. The emperor would hold a funeral for him and stop the court for three days.</p>
<p>The pretense is already extremely ridiculous, and if we trace back to ancient times, it would be even uglier. The Book of Rites: "If a member of the royal family is guilty, the Dianren will report to the king, and the king will say, 'Pardon him.' The Shishi will say, 'No.' The king will say again, 'Pardon him.' The Shishi will say, 'No.' The king will say a third time, 'Pardon him.' The Shishi will not listen and run away. The king will send someone to force him, saying, 'Don't let it go too far!'"</p>
<p>All these ugly behaviors are enough to prove that the so-called ritual system in ancient times is not worth a penny after tearing off the mask. However, the bestowal of cattle and wine and the call for three pardons at least show that it was a common occurrence in ancient times for ministers and relatives to be guilty and to plead guilty. Today, when "punishments do not reach the noblemen" has almost become an absolute truth, it makes people deeply feel the distance of history from people!</p>
<h3>Autumn Insect Song</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>The moon throws a jade plate, and flying dew captures its special light. On a clear night in the second nine, I wander alone deep into the night. Across the garden, the grasses and trees grow thickly, and the sounds of countless insects are the same. Each sound is difficult to understand, and one cries endlessly in the night. The wind is like sorrow, but why sorrow when there is no wind? The rain is like weeping, but why weep when there is no rain tonight? The vast sky is clear and bright like a painting, O insects, O insects, how can you not know? The sky is clearer, the moon is brighter, and although the insects feel nothing, I am stirred by something. Sometimes the wind is rustling, and hearing it makes my sorrow disappear. Sometimes the rain is lonely, and hearing it does not invite hatred. I am not a person of separation, so how can I have the distant and eternal mountains of longing? I have no heart for being downcast, so how can I have the feelings of leaves falling and trees shaking? Why does the feeling of namelessness suddenly come tonight? It is not hate, nor is it sorrow; it is not joy, nor is it worry. Thoughts are lingering, and feelings are dense, but they are shaken and stirred endlessly! The insects are themselves, and I am myself; thoughts are thoughts, and calls are calls. The moon is bright south and north of the street, and the sky is clear east and west of the building!</p>
