<h3>翁文灝致政院視事　發表李維果梁穎文為正副秘書長　部會首長名單今可公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕行憲首任行政院長翁文灝，廿九日下午三時到院視事，並發表李惟果，梁穎文爲正副秘書長，至全部內閣人選名單，則以民·靑兩黨入閣問題未決，未能如期公布，但翁氏之爲總統提名，經立院同意，尙係本週一之事，故翁氏首先到院視事，以處理交接事宜。翁氏今晨除以電話通知政院外，餘未作何準備。下午二時半前，政院秘書長，副秘書長甘乃光，浦薛鳳即至瑯琊路翁氏官邸迎接，旋翁氏即偕同新任秘書長李惟果與甘·浦兩氏赴政院。前政院副院長王雲五在院迎迓，翁氏抵院後即召集政院簡任以上參事·秘書見面，除對新舊任正副秘書長予以介紹外，更勉原任各部人員繼續安心工作。翁氏旋續發表周大訓·章熊·黃憲　爲參事。徐肇基·許自誠·陳漢平爲簡任秘書。周大訓參事生管機要文書，徐肇基秘書兼第一組主任。翁氏旋即離院，其接交等手續正由李惟果，梁顥文與甘乃光等接洽辦理中。又翁氏今到院視事之訊，事先鮮有人知悉，故及時往賀者不多，外次劉師舜·敎次抗立武等先後到達，翁氏於晚九時半並作視事後首次晋謁總統，有所報吿。另悉：翁氏頃已決定發表浦薛鳳氏為政院參議，據浦氏表示，願爲政院肺務，而不必担任何種名義，惟此項決定將不致有所變</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕新政院各部會首長人選之名單，卅日可能公布，迄廿九日晚止，除民·青兩黨之人選未定外，業獲全部決定，前一度傳聞將有變動之教育·社會·內政各部長，頃悉現已經翁氏懇切挽留，一仍舊職，財長前決定邀蔣廷黻出任，現業獲蔣氏之電辭，翁氏經復商請王雲五氏長財部矣。關於副院畏一席，現仍將由顧孟餘氏出任，顧氏前雖墾辭，惟翁氏於廿七日赴滬時，曾攜總統親筆信一件，誠意邀約顧氏出任斯職，現開顧氏將於廿九日夜車來京，迄廿九日晚止，京中雖尙未獲得渠應允出任之電告，惟眾信渠果來京時，將係接受總統曁翁院長之誠意邀請。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕軍開社訊：何應欽廿九日上午十時往訪白崇禧，談約一小時後辭出。</p>
<h3>徐傅霖答覆翁院長　民社黨決不入閣　青年黨意見交雷震攜京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕民社黨決不參加行憲後之新閣，即原有之政委名額亦不必保留，此項意見已由徐傳霖直接答覆翁文灝氏，翁氏則希望綱續合作，並保留名額。徐氏係廿九日晨與楊浚明自滬來京，徐氏表示，立委問題必需合理解決，但參加新閣事與此無關，即使立委問題解決，亦不擬參加政院，因目前政局困難甚多，參加後不能使其改善，不如不參加，民社黨監察委員亦暫不報到，至資政及大法官等尙可攷慮。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫德惠昨日抵滬，即赴範園訪張君勵，期能打開民社黨目前之僵局，但悉民社黨仍堅持先解決立委問題，再談參加政院。昨日中午該黨常委會邀宴雷震，席間交換意見，問雷氏力勸該黨即使不能參加部會，亦可先推出政委，參與新閣，但並無新建議提出。</p>
<p>又訊：靑年黨昨晚發表聲明，略謂，該黨是否參加新內閣，仍以立委問題之解決爲先決條件，迄廿九日中常會結束時爲止，並無參加與否之決定。該黨之正式意見已提交雷震，雷氏廿九日夜返京覆命。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿九日電〕莫德惠廿九日晚抵杭遊覽。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕政委雷震氏昨日在滬與民靑兩黨就立委名額及參加新政院等問題洽商多次，上午雷氏訪責年黨負責人詳談，中午民社黨會邀宴雷氏，表明態度。據悉：民社黨對立委問題，仍持過去主張，要求根據原來協議解決，該黨並曾向雷氏表示不參加新政院之決意，但民意機構如各省市縣參議會仍繼一續參加。該黨監委當選問題，雖有少數仍待解決，但該黨參加監察院可無問題。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕記者頃晤于院長右任，叩詢對於行憲監察院意見，于院長認爲，行憲監察院之成立，係五權憲法由試驗而正式展開，此在世界政治制度必有偉大之啓示，此次監察委員多係各地分別選舉，網羅全國英耆，新院成立，必能充分行使其職權，對新政局爲重大之匡救，至其本人，早已請辭監察委員，此次新院成立後，不但不參加新院長之競選，且絕不應選任何職務，此項意見最近已屢次公開表白，尙望社會各界予以諒鑒。</p>

<h3>萊普漢週內來滬　史蒂爾曼率領工業組同行　張嘉璈任美援運用會常委</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日電〕經濟合作局執行長官駐華代表萊普漢在此間就援　計劃與有關各方洽談一週後，定廿九日飛往舊金山，萊氏暫定於六月四日自舊金山乘泛美航空公司飛機啓程赴華，七日可抵上海，由斯帝爾曼領導之建設視察組，（即工業糾）將與萊氏同行。中央社記者獲悉，建設視察組之技術顧問，有美農業部國外農業關係司官員莫葉，馳名鐵道工程專家郝思定，一九三九年任美鐵路協會主席財政部國際財政司官員派克，及前任夫駐華大使館經濟顧問孫　爾。我駐美大使顧經鈞今曾設宴招待萊普漢及斯蒂爾曼。又訊：眾院已定六月三日處理外援撥款問題。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張嘉璈氏自辭中央銀行總裁後，外傳將實際主持美援運用事宜，本報記者昨特趨候張氏，詢以究竟。張氏表示；「顧以美援運用委員會常務委最之身份，協助籌劃運用美援，常務委員原由財長，央行總裁及繆雲台先生担任，本人巳辭去央行職務，惟仍被聘任爲常務委員，以國民一份子之身份，竭盡棉薄」。關於美援運用之道，張氏强調美方之觀點，注重自助及人助之配合，如此則因美援之增加，使物價穩定，並安定整個經濟。例如美國今日援我以糧食，亦希望我國自行增產，以維持並擴大令日之配給制度。美棉之接濟，亦期望我國能因此提高紗布之生產，以之出口，可換進更多之原料。執此兩例，可概括其餘。至於出售物資所得之現款，得美方同意，亦可用於補助財政，减少發行。但根據自助之原則，我國亦當同時提高稅收，以爲配合。張氏最後並表示爲使美援發生安定我國經濟之效力起見，必須提倡刻苦節約之風氣。</p>
<p>宋子文談輸管制　主張進口應放寬</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿九日電〕宋子文頃對記者報吿飛京經過稱，此次關於美援建設華南問題，已獲圓滿結果。美援負責者舊金山市長賴普漢，不日來華，詳細分配辦法，即可確定，大約修理粵漢路部份將可獲二千餘萬美元。宋氏在京時，外傳將設一專門機構建設華南，氏對此特予否認，並稱粵省內建設現已積極推進，如黃埔闢港，奉中央准支三千億及自籌二千億，早已興工，與粵漢路平行之公路經費亦已有着，省府現並擬以美貸款裝設完備之全省電話。某記者詢其對翁文灝長政院意見，據稱：渠目前在地方服務，對中央不宜有所批評，但渠相信新閣組成後對財政及穩定物價諸端當有一新政策。此外，對輸管制度，渠主張進口應放寬，出口問題，如整個幣制問題解決，困難即可迎刃而解。至於嚴重之汕頭米價暴漲問題，渠謂現已有三千餘包米糧運汕接濟，該地於六月十日以前即可實行配售，屆時米價可望穩定。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕首都中華農學會等廿一農界·學術·文化團體，今下午招待農業界立法委員，討論農村部份美援之運用問題。</p>
<h3>四聯總處將繼續存在　貸款政策不變更　翁院長籌劃加強全經會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕四聯總處某　責人廿九日談稱：新政院成立後，四聯是否繼續存在問題，現各方尙未具體談及，但由於事實之需要，相信四聯總處　將　續存在。現央行已成立有貼放委會，可以辦理貸放業務，但有關國策性之貸款，常與若干機關發生關係，必須由有關機關共同商討，實非央行貼放委會所能獨負其責者也。某氏並論及今後之金融政策稱：過去所推行之貸款政策，行　後將六致改變，除非立院有具體之建議案提出外，政府將仍維持過去之政策。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕新政院成立後，關於全經會之繼續存在及加强問題，聞翁院長已有籌劃，今後全經會委員之陣容，可能較過去略有調整，惟相信經濟決策有關之部會首長及純經濟學者，專家而未兼營商業或舉行業之委員，均將蟬聯。</p>

<h3>難民移墾三門灣問題</h3>
<p>— 陳慎修</p>
<p>最近上海市社會局爲求救濟各方來滬難民，建議移送難民墾建三門灣；並悉社會部亦將予以支持。利用難民剩餘勞力以開發國家富源，同時解決難民生活，是極賢明的舉措。曾記得八一三戰事初起，上海租界難民應集，前上海市社會局潘局長，曾會同仁濟善堂等慈善團體，籌設難民移殖協會，資遣難民約千人，分批往江西墾殖，成績尙可，至今尙在贛南一帶安居。可見移墾是正當的辦法。目前上海容納難民似乎已到飽和狀態，街頭乞兒，到處可見，實是政府的恥辱！如能及時移懇，不僅對難民是一大德政，也是上海市政當前的需要。現在社會局正就難民移擊一事，廣徵資料，凡在不消耗大量財力物力原則之下，能利用土地和難民自己的勞力以解決生活而達到救濟的目的的開懇等計劃，都在蒐羅研究之列；其目的地自亦不以三門灣爲限。</p>
<p>三門灣是浙江沿海港灣之一，北起象山港石浦（實業計劃的漁業港），南到潰浦，與靈江口的台州灣相接，其東羅列舟山羣烏。以漁市聞名的定海沈家門和佛敎聖地普陀山，就是舟山羣烏列島之一。三門灣以石浦爲出口，以海游爲中心，東南面海海岸綫約五百公里。從寗波到石浦航程六小時，石浦到海游汽船亦數小時可到。</p>
<p>石浦南有南田島，爲三門灣唯一大島。南田在淸代爲禁區，淸末始設撫民廳，民國肇始置縣，名爲南田縣。三門灣沿岸則爲寗海縣和臨海縣所屬。民國廿九年七月，浙江省政府設三門縣，以海遊鎭爲臨時縣治，廢南田縣，使爲三門縣的一區，三門縣轄舊有寗海縣東南部臨海縣東北部，益以南田縣原有面積包括整個三門灣海灣和沿岸陸地。從此地理上的三門灣和行政區域上的三門縣合而爲一。過去三門灣分屬南田·密海·臨海三縣，政令難趨一致，步驟容有先後。所以三門縣的成立，是開發三門灣一件重要的事。</p>
<p>三門縣人口十五萬，（三十三年，一五六八四〇口），過半數以海爲生，漁鹽之利也佔全縣總收人的半數。居民有言：「求之於山，不如求之於海」。每年漁汎，漁船五六百對，出海捕魚，每對漁船，捕漁每次四五十担不等。鹽塲，多在健跳灃浦，（南灣），年產鹽十萬擔。</p>
<p>三門灣以石浦爲海口，以海游爲中心，已如前述。海遊現爲三門縣洽所在地，與石浦汽船相通，可轉口寗波，上海。陸路自海　經寗海到奉化，寗波，或經天台到新昌，紹興，杭州，公路修復後，都只有一天路程。縣境內大路及電話通各重要鄉鎭如亭旁，健跳等地。三門全縣耕地約二十萬畝，以稻榖爲主，山地種植苧麻禒麻、海塘初淡地種植棉花等作物。但最使人注意的是海塗，就是開發三門灣的著眼所在。三門灣全縣海塗在五千畝以上的有：大南田塗八千畝，蛇盤塗五萬畝，貓頭塗一萬畝，正嶼塗一萬五千畝，老人巖塗六千畝，建康塘塗五千畝，余奧塗五千畝，全縣海塗荒山荒地總積在一百十萬畝以上。浙江省對此，曾有海濱測量隊實地測量。其他岱門鳥產卵石（建築材料）甚鹽，可轉運上海爲建築之需。</p>
<p>三門灣經濟地理，略如上述。耕地面積只有全而積五分之一，而漁鹽之利，又無盡藏，所謂「求之於山十載，取之於海一瞬」。開發三門灣的前途，是應該很可樂觀的。國父孫中山先生實業計劃，關於石浦建港開發三門灣部份，的確有先見之明，而平易可循，絕對能够實現的。</p>
<p>三門灣沿灣及各烏嶼比較開發成熟的，當推南田烏，就是民國以來經過三十年經營的前南田縣治，現在爲三門縣的南田區。南田四面環海，人口二三二九八人（三十三年度），島上有南北漁山。全縣無論海濱山陬，多半童山濯懼，而南田區內所見，則山上茂林修竹，海口漁船相接，居民同時亨受山珍海味，爲其他海濱生活所無。這一點，要從三門灣開發歷史上去觀察。淸代南田爲禁區，到民國前不久才設撫民寵。那時，三門灣沿岸還人跡稀少，一則本地居民本來不多，一則當時三門灣沿岸當寗　　海等縣的邊界，海濱一陬之地，不甚被人注意。而南田島則民國後設縣，漸漸繁榮。雖然，現在南田區的生產人口和地力的比例，還是不够。上文所列八千畝海　（大南田塗），就是等待開發的。</p>
<p>四十年來倡言開發三門灣和今後三門灣開發的可能途徑，無非是（一）築軍港，（二）築漁業港，（三）建市，（四）農墾。</p>
<p>三門築軍港的可能，要從光緒年問義大利謀租借爲軍港說起。在地理上，三門灣西北靠陸地有高山，灣內可以避風，其地位在北緯三十度以南，爲天然不凍港，而根墟海測報吿，吃水很深的巨艦可以停泊。實業計劃的東方大港似乎是爲了要取代不平等的南京條約廢棄前的上海，現在東方大港的重要性减小，却增加象山港和三門灣建港的重要性。三門沿灣的農產品，足以供應一個海軍基地的需要，海游溪可以利用水力發電供應電力，足够爲海軍基地條件。</p>
<p>三門灣築漁業港原爲實業計劃山所定。構成漁業港的條件，不外乎運銷便利，漁具改良，與漁類加工廠和製冰廠的設備，而尤貴乎漁產最豐當。據三門灣老漁者談，三門灣魚汎，魚類爲漁船所捕獲者不過三四成，如能利用新式漁船，產量必可大增，至於漁產運銷方面，並無問題，但加工和冷藏設備，所費甚巨，而一般民衆知識低落，所以目前漁業和漁民生活改良，都無進步。</p>
<p>三門建市之說，亦經多年提倡。筆者以爲三門灣建一商業市甚少希望。因三門灣在地形上三面瀕海，以海口言，北有寗波，南有溫州，臺州，足爲浙東沿海貨物之吞吐，而與三門灣接壤的天台，仙居等縣，都是貧瘠之區。仙居以西，東陽義烏已屬浙贛鐵路範疇，自無庸三門灣爲海口，則計劃中之三義鐵路（三門到義爲）建成，三門之商業地位，仍不能取代上海。亦正因爲如此，三義鐵路築成的可能性和需要性亦大爲减低。</p>
<p>三門灣的最大開發可能，還是農懇。農墾可以安置多數無專門按術學識的農民。三門可供農墾的土地亦相當多，而且也以農墾着手爲較易。晨墾必須有土地，資本，和勞力，但以目前社會不靖，治安問題還須多多借重政府權力。三門灣土地，有的爲民有私產，巳經耕殖；有的已經人民報領而朱開墾；有的還是海塗，需要築堤養淡。所以在地權和土地分配方面，又須有一番整頓淸理。勞力方面，如本文開始所述，自然利用難民的勞力，同時爲難民解決生活。不過墾荒事業，自是　路襤褸，無所憑藉，難民們依靠都市，還可暫時寄生，茍延一時，海灘荒塗，灣來潮去，是否會使難民望而却步，則必定有賴於政府的命令。但政府能否在事先有所佈置，有所號召，似又爲移墾的一重要問題。所以地力，財力，權力，人力，和兵力五者，可說是移墾的先決條件·</p>
<p>去年浙江省當局和善後救濟總署合作，開墾餘姚牟山湖畔荒塗，組織　務委員會主其事。計開墾得湖塗蘆　荒地三千七百畝，預計今年秋收可以有所收穫。這三千七百畝地，已分配給一百三十三戶農戶，每戶平均得地約二十畝，平均每畝地產嗀二石（初墾地計），合米一石，二十畝合米二十石，可以養活平均五口之家。牟山湖開墾的人力財力耗費多少呢？根據報導，化了行總八十八噸工賑麵粉，餘姚縣二千石稻穀，使用八架曳引機器，歷時一年。這是一個很切實的例子。在國家財富設，期之他年，是有益的；若以目前的成本利利益計，這開懇似乎是蝕本的。開墾三門灣，必須要政府領導，高瞻遠矚，不惜工本，設置機構，運用人才，纔可計日程功。若仍如一般從將本求利上著眼，則勢必至五十年後還是五十年前的三門灣，殆可斷言。移墾三門，客觀說，是當前十分急切的需要；究成這個需要，它本身還需要很多條件，更需要政府和社會都有決心去幹。</p>

<h3>楊妹不食之謎　渝醫學界座談　發生熱烈論戰　楊妹亦到場旁廳</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿八日電〕對於楊妹不食之謎，渝醫學界今下午四時曾與李之郁局長論戰，渝醫師公會理事長安龍章及留德名醫韓名炬，始終認爲衛生局觀察方法欠嚴密，且不能因楊十九日來未進食，即斷定以往九年亦未進食。武漢療義院院長黃月聰，引證歷史上不食人姓名及時問，並申述短期絕食，可治療癎病。李答稱：楊妹並未發現有招搖撞騙行爲，値茲行憲時期，目前僅能用此種方式初步觀察，因衛生局並無理由强迫伊進院，陸軍醫院長震卯光則强調，非研究到底不可，否則爲科學界之恥辱，且科學日新月異，即使楊妹三月未食，亦不必顧慮推翻科學。</p>
<p>彭光欽博士堅稱：科學需觀察事實，由事實得出結論，對楊妹不必太抱好奇心，不一定要完全不吃才有價値，旣無吃飯習慣，此反常行爲即有研究必要。又最近二十日主持楊妹觀察之胡先華主任，報吿楊妹十九日來特徵：（一）體重無形中曾减輕。（二）口溫陰天華氏九二度，晴天則九六度，隨氣候變化。（三）小便第一次中有尿素酸素等物質不正常，如尿素佐基酸酊Creatinine多。參與會議最感覺興趣者，即楊妹曾於四時半到塲旁聽，坐五分鐘後即離去，能度大方，惟無閉嘴習慣。各科學家對此白膚大眼女郎，咸抱敬意，當伊在塲聽講時，說話人均自動改呼「楊小姐」。</p>

<h3>馬卿指責蘇惡意宣傳　阻撓美和平努力　美蘇談判基礎竟遭破壞</h3>
<p>〔路透社奧勒岡州波特蘭廿八日電〕馬歇爾國務卿廿八日向此間婦女協會聯合會發表演說，指責蘇聯政府從事故意而惡意的宣傳運動，以阻撓美國誠意發動談判以解決世界問題的努力。渠云，如果蘇聯政府能放棄某種業已使世界陷入不安與紊亂狀態的作風及行動，即可造成國際上的新氣氛，果爾，美國政府決不致置之不理。馬卿又吿美國人民曰，歐洲人民今已恐美國不足爲賴，深懼美國將變更其意志，而放棄歐洲復興計劃。但渠又曰，自本年初以來，在獲取和平安全及恢復世界繁榮等方面已獲良好進展，相信美國如繼續進行其堅定的政策，必可解決最劣的困難，而成立完善的和平基礎。渠確信唯有此一堅決的途徑，始能拯救民主的地位。馬卿述及美國國內就最近美蘇外交換文事所從事的熱烈討論時，指出從事此等討論者未免忽略蘇聯政府正對美國發動故意及惡意的宣傳攻勢，以破壞美國誠意覓取談判基礎，以謀解決世界問題的努力。須知莫洛托夫外長及史達林總理最近所發表具有特定目的之聲明，意在獲取穴傳上的利益，使美國亦即世界與論曲解美國覓取諒解的誠憲。美國政府必須保持其行動一貫的原則，美國政府決不能進行雖能見效於一時，而有損美國朱來政策完整性的行動，同時盼美國人民亦勿爲不顯事實的宣傳行動的欺騙。近代極權宣傳的方法，在造成不足以代表眞正局勢或成功的行動之可能性的印象，過去歷次談判均未能獲致穩定世界局勢及發展和平基礎所需之合作。今美國境內具有强烈的要求，切盼獲致協定，消滅戰爭恐懼，恢復正常局勢，因此對於缺乏實際行動，口是心非的任何聲明均表憤慨。渠相信獲取和平安全及恢復仳界繁榮之志願，無人較渠更爲堅强，然渠以國務卿之地位，決不能使美國爲一時之情感所衝動，而接受足以威脅其夫來的義務，或行動。歐洲之恐懼，實係對於美國政策發展的方式有所悮解所致。今日之世界已陷於深刻的不安之中，世界之不幸人民業已知悉，彼等所享之利益無法與其他民族相比，茍不給予若干希望，恐不免引起狂潮，蓋此等不安將爲主張暴力者活動之理想塲介故也。</p>
<h3>蔣廷黻演說述中國情況</h3>
<p>〔合衆社奧勒岡州波時蘭廿八日電〕中國駐聯合國安理會代表蔣廷黻博士今日向波特蘭市協會演說稱，中國情形雖頗多類似一九一七年之俄國，然中國人民酷愛個人自由，故深信中國不致淪爲共產國家。渠稱，「在國土，人口，文盲，缺乏民主經驗及赤貧各點上，一九一七年之俄國與一九四八年之中國，有虎實中郎之似。</p>
<p>此外兩者尙有留學國外之智識階級及不同之外來思想，其中頗多不適於中國。」蔣氏稱，兩國最大之不同，在於中國人熱愛個人自由，且中國無大地主。渠宣稱，處於共產主義統治下之中國人，對共產主義畏如蛇蝎，常有數百萬人自共區逃入國軍區而無人相反逃行。蔣氏稱，由於實施配給制及直接稅之困難，故中國之通貨膨脹頗難控制。渠稱，「欲配給當塲消費之貨品，顯似不可能，而中國土地所有人及銀行存款，往往有一人兼用多名開戶，故直接說之類亦近於不可能推行。一人可擁有無數圖章，故土地存款之眞實主人，實無從揭露。」</p>
<h3>蘇違約行為先後達卅七次</h3>

<h3>華萊士譴責美反共法案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十九日電〕義第三黨總統候選人華萊士今日在參院司法委會中作證，譴責反共法案乃向美國權利「宣戰」。並稱，如該法案成爲法律，第三黨不擬服從。華氏又稱，此項措置損及言論自由集會自由之基本保障。渠指斥業經衆院通過之反共法案「滿紙虛僞」，雖號構預防獨栽，而「使美國檢察長成爲國內每一組織之獨栽者」。華氏自稱其本人及黨徒主張美蘇「和談」，故根據該法案，均有被科罰金及被處徒刑之虞。華萊士再稱反共法案日標，並非共產主義而係民主主義。</p>
<h3>柏林聯合軍政府將壽終正寢</h3>
<p>昨日會議不歡而散</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林廿九日電〕在東西敵視氛圍中，四盟國統治柏林軍政府於會議十五小時後，不歡而散。跡象表示四强軍政府不日將壽終正寢。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿九日電〕柏林四强聯合司令部於柏林時間廿八日上午十時起開會，至廿九日上午一時十五分始已，計歷時十五小時又十五分鐘，然獲致之唯一協議，僅爲於午刻同意暫停開會以便進餐，及於下午暫停進茶點。議程所列各項由於均朱獲致協議，故已悉自議松剔除。討論時，英代表赫勃特少將一度指責蘇代表故意兜圈子而無討論的誠意，渠並指蘇方徵用勞工，使在蕯克遜尼採鈾。渠又謂蘇聯區內生產銳减，賦稅重重，計每人所派稅捐達四百五十馬克，而西方區內每人僅派得二百七十馬克，蘇聯區全部稅收計八十億馬克，而被蘇當局徵作賠償·佔領費·及其他費用者達六十億鎊。美代表霍萊將軍亦謂柏林蘇聯區內百分之四十五之工業生產方係爲蘇聯之利益而生產，按柏林四强聯合司令部乃柏林唯一尙在活動之四强機構，四强盟管會自三月二十日蘇代表退出會塲以來，即停頓迄今。</p>

<h3>耶城舊城猶軍投降後阿軍續包圍新城　拉特朗阿猶軍展開決戰</h3>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷廿九日電〕外約但國王率領之阿拉伯外籍軍於攻佔耶路撒冷之舊城後，已將耶城新城包圍，並以臼炮及重炮向猶軍據點轟擊。</p>
<p>另一部份阿拉伯軍隊向耶路撒冷——台拉維夫公路上之拉特朗區進攻，使耶城猶軍完全孤立以及阻止必須之接濟品達到猶太守軍手中。阿拉伯之坦克車，臼炮及增援部隊已源源開入拉特朗區中。同時埃及飛機向該區西四哩之赫爾達及沙哈區猶軍集中地施行轟炸。外約但之軍隊似已在採取贏得耶城舊城勝利之同樣戰術向新城進攻，即切斷外界之援助，一面向內部進攻直至投降。阿拉伯官方稱，舊城投降之二千五百名猶人中戰士爲五百人，婦女及兒童二千人，五百名戰士已於廿五日晚由卡車載送至阿曼附近之戰俘集中營，婦女及兒童則由救濟機構拘禁。</p>
<p>〔合衆社赫樂大廿九日電」以色列軍隊廿九日以整個裝甲旅及空軍之兵力，對抗拉特朗之阿拉伯軍團，力岡打通耶路撒冷公路生命綫幷增援其耶路撒冷新城之以色列守軍。在以色列指揮下之每一臼炮·野戰炮·裝甲車·及飛機已馳赴前綫以加强以色列之攻勢。阿勃杜拉國王阿拉伯軍團之精銳部隊現堅守拉特朗，曾奉令堅守公路，勿爲擬解除耶路撒冷新城之圍之猶太援軍所衝過。現在各種跡象，表示由英方訓練之阿拉伯軍團與英中軍之猶太退伍軍人，不久將在歇弗萊平原上，進行巴勒斯坦戰爭中首次裝甲部隊之決戰。職塲係在歇弗萊平原之東端，位於勒霍伏脫東南八哩左右之處，猶太軍前敵司令爲一前英軍中一高級軍官。</p>
<h3>英蘇法對聖地三決議案　安理會將付表決　我代表支持英休戰一月建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿九日廣播：成功湖訊蘇代表葛羅米柯本日在安理會中對革國之巴勒斯坦政策復大施抨擊，力主通過蘇聯所提由聯合國强硬干涉聖地局勢之建議。葛氏指美方之建議違背聯大決議，故如予通過實屬非法。英代表賈德幹當初答辦，指葛羅米柯之責難爲惡意侮辱。英蘇之建議，均難望通過，安理會決先就蘇聯建議提付表決。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿九日電〕安全理事會定於廿九日恢復討論巴勒斯坦問題，以覓取制止該處戰事之若干方式。待安理會討論之決議案共有三則，一爲英國之決議案，要求實行四個星期之休戰，並禁止任何武器軍火輸入巴勒斯坦；一爲蘇聯之決議案，要求安理會令巴勒斯坦之交職雙方於卅六小時內休戰，不然即確認該處局勢業已破壞和平，依據憲章實施制裁；一爲法國之決議案，要求於休戰令不能履行時，即由聯合國實施制裁。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿九日電〕聯合國安理會廿九日將表決巴勒斯坦問題之提案。蘇聯之建議現僅擁有七票必要多數中之五票，至於能使蘇聯建議獲致通過之比利時及阿根廷兩票，傳在最後投票前尙在猶豫中。聯合國官員認爲即使蘇聯建議能獲致七票，亦不致保證英國之不用否決權。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿八日電〕安理會廿八日恢復討論英國及蘇聯所提關於巴勒斯坦之決議案時，各代表之意見頗見懸殊，中國及加拿大，均支援英國建議成立一月休戰。華盛頓之美國官員則表示英國之建議堪爲改進英美關係之基礎，彼等並日：蘇聯要求由安理會採取强制行動之案，難望被安理會通過。屆時美國仍當對英國之建議案投贊成票。烏克蘭代表泰拉浦金指英國之決議案，實爲支援一方以抗另一方顯有偏袒之意。</p>
<h3>關於聖地問題　貝文不欲爭辯</h3>
<p>英否認正在研究新辦法</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕貝文外相向婦女工會致辭，聲明渠之未嘗參加美國境內及他處關於巴勒斯坦之口頭爭辯，係因渠正努力覓取相信於最後得以引起巴勒斯坦問題的解決之意見之故。渠於指出在世界各地關於發展和平及協調的努力，巳獲相當進展。後乃日：甚至在戰雲瀰漫的巴勒斯坦，人民亦莫不渴　問題之得以解決。述及經濟間題時，渠謂英國及他國在馬歇爾方案之援助下，不難使生產及生產標準恢復戰前水準，此固人人所深切盼望者也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕外交部頃否認，外傳英政府正在研究解決巴勒斯坦問題之新辦法，即將遞交美國政府之說，發言人相信，聯合國任命之巴勒斯坦斡旋專員貝那多特，不難促成猶阿間之談判。</p>
<h3>法總理又臨危機　解僱公務員案要求投信任票</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿九日電〕爲要求准許政府解僱公務員十五萬名之法案，而向議會要求信任票之許曼總理，又面臨危險的新威脅。此一新危機係因許曼總理及人民共和黨衛生部長夏布伊夫人於若干日前簽要命令，間接准許國家公款津貼敎會學校之兒童而起。許曼及夏布伊夫人簽署該令前，並未徵求社會黨及急進黨閣員之意見，聞社會黨已擬要求以撤銷該令爲對許曼投信任票之條件。現人民共和黨正在幕後活動，期於下週二表決信任票時得獲通過。如不幸而不能獲得信任票，則就職雖僅七閱月而已六次要挾辭職之許曼，將不得不掛冠而去。</p>
<h3>南非國家黨秉政　英深感不安</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕南非國民黨領抽馬朗在普選中擊敗斯末資後，即將籌組新閣，今後舉行自治領會議，渠亦將與斯末資同時被邀參加。英國恐不能對南非問題保持超然態度，因每一自治領均與倫敦保持密切之關係也。馬朗國民黨之勝利，在英政界中已引起極度不安，該黨素以反英反黑人反猶太人及親納粹聞名。</p>

<h3>蘇發展庫頁島千島　設立集體農場漁場</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿八日電〕消息報今日載稱二全部集體農塲正自蘇聯歐洲部份中區，遷往庫頁烏南部及千島列島。蘇聯人民遷居該兩島者日見增加，其中有專門技術人員及各業職員。截至現在爲止，已有三十四個集體農塲，在庫頁島南部成立，六十五個集體漁塲在千島成立。</p>
<h3>適應原子戰爭　美計劃編練新軍　遠東區流動戰術研究完畢</h3>
<p>〔路透社塞雷郡坎勃萊廿九日電〕英陸海空軍高級官員在此間參謀學校，舉行歷時一星期之「紙上演習」，以研究「遠東戰區中流動戰術之設計及執行」畢，英帝國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥向記者發表談話，暢論改革戰後英陸軍之意見，認爲眞實的準備狀態，目前較以前更爲必需。渠指出戰後的陸軍，須由正規軍·國民兵·及受訓練的設備兵等三部合組而成。僅有正規軍及地方設備兵，不足以應現代戰爭的考驗。戰後的陸軍須有基本的改革，以建立隨時可以開赴前綫的優良國軍。此外防空組織必須儘先成立，以應付空中威脅。</p>
<h3>美參院外委會援華報告（五）</h3>
<p>中國自助之措施與保證</p>
<p>欲使外援能發揮效力，中國政府本身必須能確定其方針，使中國獲得力量與安定。一個為人民利益着想之政府，比較不易受到外來勢力之損害。因此，委員會在對援華問題採取有利行動之時，對於一九四八年一月廿八日行政院長張羣在南京所發表之聲明，印象甚深。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>據委員會之意見，中國國民政府在蔣委員長二十年慘澹經營領導之下，已成爲吾人之共·同戰友，以應付對國際和平與安全之威脅，及共黨之侵略。本國政府所核准之進一步援助，證明美國關心中國之獨立與完整，中國人民之福利，及遠東之安定和平。</p>
<p>附錄中</p>
<p>援華議案之分析及一九四八年經濟合作法案之有關規定：</p>
<p>第二節：本節擬定議案之目標及援華之方式。本議案之目標爲援助中國以解除人類之痛苦，阻過經濟之惡化，及使中國人民有機會發動自助之揹施，重建經濟安定情形之基礎。此種援助係根據一九四八年經濟合作法案之規定，此等規定符合本議案之目標，而該議案之目標，並非謂中國必須遵守歐洲復興之共同計劃，方能獲得議案下對華之援助，將根據一九四八年經濟合作法案中對本議案目標及中國情形有關之規定。援助之方法及範圍與參加歐洲復典計劃之各國相同。因此，經濟合作法案之規定將適用於中國，與該法案之目標無關，而僅與本議案之目標有關。</p>
<p>第三節：省關援華法案一節之（A）項，授權以不超過三百萬美元之數額撥與總統，自法案實施之日起一年內可以動川，藉以遵照綁濟復興法案可以適用之各項目的，而不必顧及一九四八年經濟復興法案之各項規定。根據本項所撥之基金，可經由贈予方式用以援助中國，藉以促進本法案之各項目的。其辦理方法，僅須總統認爲足以促進此等目的即可。</p>
<p>第四節：本節規定須與中國簽訂一項協定，其中包括中國必須提供美千保證，此等保證，係於國務卿與經濟合作執行人會商後，可能認爲對於實施本法案之各項規定，以及改善對華商業關係（包括以平等機會給予美國金業之各項措置在內），係屬必要者。</p>
<p>預料為使根據本法案第三節（O）項所撥基金可用以援助中國而談判協定中之此一部份時，行政部門應視適用於中國之程度，運照一九四八年經濟合作法案第十五項（B）辦理，但不必受共限制。例如參院法案二二〇二號第十五項（B）第五段至第八段所包括之事務，猶如參院所通過者，預料僅須將此數段之文字稍作修正，即可適用於中國。至於該法案第一段至第八段，則經不同程度之修正後，可能適用於中國之情形，惟其中若干部份，須修正至完全改寫之程度。</p>
<p>第五節：本節授權由復興金融公司墊款，總數不得超過五千美元，以便實施本法案中各項規定，以待本法案第三項項下之基金，實行撥付。（完）</p>
<h3>西歐公路網　已擬具暫定計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務部頃透露：四月間在日內瓦開會之聯合國歐經會內陸運輸委員會，業已擬具建立西歐公路網之暫定計劃。參加該會議者有法·義·比·丹·荷·瑞典·瑞士及德境英美區諸單位。計劃內容擬自斯坎的那維亞南達義大利，大西洋岸直達匈波，建築聯貫之公路綫，其擬築之公路綫，將在德奧捷等四點貫穿「鐵幕」。惟國務部加以解釋稱，未參加日內瓦會議各國所通過之公路綫，雖亦在會中擬定，惟在與此等政府獲得協定以前，不擬採取行動，將各該國之公路併入國際公路網。國務部並謂，德義境內許多現成之汽車大道，均將併入此一制度，爲便利客車及卡車迷輸起見，將設法减輕國際公路網所通過之各國國境關卡限制</p>

<p>首由周一志律師將辯護意旨作總的說明，略謂：「該案之形成，係由於嚴重的失業問題，禁舞後十數萬人必陷於失業，爲生計所迫，故右請願之舉。再說禁舞根本無理由（一）跳舞早經取得合法之營業地位，今竟以一紙命令，剝奪人民之工作權與生存權，且並無好的轉業方法，想行政當局發此命令時缺乏深長考慮。（二）或謂禁舞係節約，不知應節約之事甚多，政府不擇其市要者節約，而首先禁舞，實爲捨本逐末。（三）退一萬步言，舞應當禁，也必須經過合法手續，應先由立法院制定禁舞法，通過後施行，根據該法逐步禁舞，方合法合理。且憲法第一百五十五條載明，對於人民職業，政府應予保障，今使有業者失業，亦爲違憲之舉。至本案發生近因，係由於社會局不按照規定於一月三十一日下午抽籤，而提前於上午抽籤，社局已先失信於人。至警局將該案依緊急治罪法第七條移送，尤爲不當。查第七條中所包括者爲微治盜匪條例第三條第一項第七款：「意圖擾亂治安而放火燒燬，決水侵害，或以其他方法毀壞公署或軍事設備者」，將一羣為生計而被　請願的可憐蟲，引用這樣重的條文，誠所謂小題大做，牛刀殺鷄，請求庭上宣吿被吿無罪，或移送地院辦理。又在押被吿羈押四月餘，其痛苦巳達極點，請准交保。」</p>
<p>男女被告泣不可仰</p>
<p>當周律師講至激昂時，在押被吿均泣不可仰，即輕易不流淚之男被吿亦抽泣不已。、</p>
<p>嗣由陳霆銳律師辯護，亦指述警局援用戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例之不當。並謂「警局經三個月偵查之久，始將該案送至鈞庭，可是研究其中並無人證物證，直接或間接證據，結果警局亦覺此事不妥，遂以女學生金英爲藉口，認爲背後必有人煽動，然調查結果，金英無共黨嫌疑，警局予以交保，認爲煽動之金英交保，而認爲被煽動之三十七被吿反而羈押，不通之至。」</p>
<h3>數千人之行動　一二人難負咎</h3>
<p>繼復列舉造成事件之遠因近因種種因素，謂激成事　惡化，決非職工會理事長之咎，若以數千人之行動，使一二人負責，在法律上亦講不通。末並指摘警局稱：「各被吿於羈押警局期間，家屬曾向地院聲請提審，三月四日地院發出提審票，但警局置之不理，其超法律之行爲，不知將作何解。」</p>
<h3>唐宗傑未動手</h3>
<p>傳况鱗律師辯護稱：「關於被告唐宗傑部份，查舞應業聯合辦事處係五個單位聯合組織，被吿僅有五分之一責任，主席團共有五十人，被吿僅有五十分之一責任，警局調查報吿書中亦有唐宗傑勸阻撫效字樣，旣經勸阻，必未動手，堪以認定。其次唐是否爲共產黨員一點，查唐係國民黨團忠實工作人員，已有函證明，此點亦不攻自破。」</p>
<p>華稀珍律師亦爲唐宗傑辯護，請鑑定紀錄簿中唐宗傑提萬字樣，墨跡不符，顯係後加入者。馬君碩律師稱：「據警局調查報吿書，被吿查瑞永·蘇金生·兪金寶等，亦不過打點東西，根本談不上强盜，如何能用懲治盜匪條例與緊急治罪法。</p>
<h3>麻皮麻皮閧堂大笑</h3>
<p>黃曾木一律師爲麻皮舞女譚佩娥辯護：「打社會局的麻皮，不是本案被吿的麻皮，據報載當時打社會局的麻舞女面略帶麻，身着紅巴旗袍，而被吿麻得很利害，被吿因爲麻皮，不喜出風頭，故衣着筷素，從不着紅色衣服，由此可知此麻皮非彼麻皮，打社局的麻皮早溜走了。」黃律師連說十幾個麻皮，引起閧堂大笑，幷將譚佩娥提出，王庭長對之端詳一番。</p>
<p>其餘張紅薇李素珍等亦各爲被吿聲辯。律師辯畢，王庭長詢各被吿有無意見，警局移送之第一名朱霖舉手，聲明幷未煽動，幷跪下要求交保。其餘三十六被吿亦全體跪下請准交保，　聲一片，被吿家屬在旁聽席上亦號啕大哭，王庭長連忙說：「有話好講，大家立起來。」嗣即宣吿本案定六月三日下午二時宣判，在押被吿交保不准，仍予還押。五時三十分退庭。</p>

<h3>米市場外喊小　比較上日降落二十萬元</h3>
<p>米市回降，因錫市已見回短，人心　致　疲，塲內仍未做開，塲外價格較上日降落二十萬元，惟交易不多，而白元及陰元則去化活潑，米店吸胃不弱，故市仍堅站不動。白元仍屹立八百萬，白粳做六百八十萬，薄稻與白粳同價，早稻六百六十萬，羊秈亦退爲六百七十萬元。民調會拋米照舊，到貨再見减少，二市共計一千九百三十四石。</p>
<p>麵粉挫落，因新小麥不日登塲，蘇錫價已下落，致執戶咸感心虛，紛來脫手。早市最爲疲軟，老車閒盤爲二百零五萬，中市因中信局拋粉價提高三萬，爲二百零三萬送到，市始止疲爲挺。老車終以二百零九萬收市，兵船亦先小後升，收市爲二百零八萬，各見軋小五六萬元。紅蜂，建成等雜脾粉均小五萬，麩皮疲降十萬，小麥廠胃不濃，以二百九十萬原盤開出。</p>
<p>雜糧銷路轉呆，在米價之報降下，人心旣疲，市乃下游。黃豆油廠及客帮均少納取，貨主巳感乏力扳持，價終挫落。漢口乍豆收市三百三十萬元，計降十萬元。苞米降二十萬元。紅糧退落十五萬，菉豆亦呆，新靑議仍開二九五萬，新元麥下疲，芝蔴平軟，生仁存底薄弱，獨挺五十萬元。</p>
<p>食油挫跌，各糧均降，致亦引起賣風，本街進胃亦减，散戶有吐無進。豆汕初降較鉅，最低順裕豆油先開一千四百二十萬元，後市轉升，最後大有豆油一千四百八十萬元，終吿軋低二三十萬元。生菜油亦小二三十萬，生油略疲一二十萬，淸油生蔴油一致下降，小車蔴油小三十萬。豆餅初小三四萬，後以散戶胃活，終吿同升，僅見略挫萬元。</p>
<h3>食米塲外交易將採取締辦法</h3>
<p>昨日爲政府實行每日拋售六千担辦法之最後一天，下星期政府米是否繼續拋售，依據何種價格，均待吳市長作最後決定。</p>
<p>社會局糧食科長吉明齊，昨曾答覆記者所詢，一週來拋米及限價政策收效如何等問題，據稱：食米漲風已遭阻抑，此乃最大之效果，惟一般米商表示，拋米及限價之結果，造成塲外交易，並使食米來源减少。</p>
<p>據吉科長稱：塲外喊價雖高，但以政府配米充斥，故塲外交易成交者不多，當局對此　加意，將有取締之新辦法。</p>
<p>關於因配米而使產區來源减少一點，吉氏表示亦無問題，因爲目前本市食米非缺擋時期，政府供來超過需要量，不必全賴產區供應。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於下月份戶口米之配價，將於明日下午會議決定，聞市長已與美方商治，請維持本月份三百五十萬之原價。</p>
<h3>空方頻施壓力　華股疲態依然</h3>

<p>晨開即疲，永紗退爲二七三〇元，開後因乘低補進者較多，而先見二七五五元，不久即遭七一號等賣到二六八〇元，二二四號等進意尙具，微升爲二七〇〇〇元。空方壓力不小，八九號等了結，乃見二六三五元低價。代辦費開二七元及三一元，無甚影響。後經五二號等乘低來進，暗市高起不少，套轉者大不乏人，步升至二六九五元。近午賣小到二六五五元，但顧某及銀行帮維持，一五二號等吸納，午收升爲二七〇〇元。較前收計內衣跌一成，中法景綸中絲商務跌半成，華新永公平平，餘均微降。塲外各未上市股票疲軟少許。</p>
<p>公債昨以幣制改革聲中，買戶孔殷，統丙晨開二四萬二，自二三萬九升至二五萬四，而後稍平。成交約四百萬，較前收計甲乙升一萬四，丙漲一萬九，統丁好起一萬六，戊種升六千元。</p>
<p>外股昨疲後轉穩，尤以英聯所回更速，證券帮賣出，銀行帮洋行帮買進。怡紗晨開四四〇萬，自四三六萬起升至四五〇萬外。英聯自四七五萬起，升至五〇〇萬外結束。較前收計英聯航業微升，業展紙版尙平，怡紗會德豐怡　鋼業均吿微降。</p>
<h3>中信局公開標售　對日易貨呢羢</h3>
<p>中央信託局代辦政府對日易貨，於去年輸入呢絨三十一萬碼，原爲配合政府平抑物價政策，供應市需，惟因當時毛絨紡織工業公會方面建議轉銷國外，故一面將貨存放於關棧內暫不報關，並一面呈報行政院及財政部請示處理辦法。</p>
<p>行政院曾爲此案，召集有關機關，詳予審議，並經將審查意見，令知中信局在國內市塲銷售。現中信局已遵令辦理，補行報關。並規定於六月二日，由代售會第一次公開標售派立司·凡立丁·羽紗等，先二日可看樣及辦理申請乎續。</p>

<h3>人心虛怯不振　棉紗布市平疲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，似呈參差狀態，四十二支藍鳳細紗，複製廠商仍有吸納，初開行情即見躍升三百萬元，嗣以本客兩帮進意懈怠，卒低至三億一千六百萬元收盤，比上日尙軋升一百萬元。水月金城等牌及四十支紗各方取捨不一，市盤互有升沉。</p>
<p>廿一支雙馬紗，初開亦挺升二百萬元，後因客地行情倒掛，並受六月一日起當日支票不能抵用影響，人心見怯，檯面帮及散戶拋售，結果較上日回跌七百萬元。其餘二十支十六支及卅二支等紗，均回小一二百萬至六七百萬元不一。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因北歸游資續有到來，徐州蚌埠等帮進取仍强，染廠亦略有吸收，同業互有進取，市勢堅途徘徊。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，晨開即跳上五萬，市上銀根鬆弛，感傳有改革幣制之謠，散戶等拉提甚勁，行情再高至七百十六萬元。嗣有浮多互相爭售，並因六月一日起行莊當日支票限制抵用，人心不振，咸抱觀望，故最後龍頭細布回小至七百零九萬，比上日步挺一萬元。五福·藍鷄·彩球等牌，亦續升一萬至三四萬元。此外細斜粗布嘩嘰等，去化尙佳，步高五萬至十萬元不一，士林布亦尙挺秀。</p>

<p>〔中央社曼谷廿八日電〕暹敎一部昨晨召集我僑校校董及校長等二百餘人，幷於會中正式警吿稱：華僑學校幷無特許權利，而須與其他學校同樣遵守關於私立學校之規則。按暹方前曾否鑾貪隆政府根據中暹友好條約畀予我僑校之若干特許權，今日之警吿，用意與前相似。暹敎部發言人並稱：暹政府擬限制華僑在曼谷及其他省份之學校，因其數量「過多」。但學校封閉後，該部將如何解決數千華僑兒童之教育問題，渠殊無絲毫表示。此間中立人士表示：華僑所辦學校可爲暹羅减少大量文盲，故在撲滅文盲運動，仍爲聯合國文敎組織要務，暹封閉大量旣設之敎育機關，實非得策。</p>

<h3>復旦豫籍學生為已故同學王慧萬申冤　指控中山醫院玩忽職責·草菅人命</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復且大學統計系一年級學生王慧萬，於本月廿四日病逝於中山醫院，該校河南同學會，頃指控該院「玩忽職責，草菅人命」，向各界發表控訴書。據稱：王生現年廿三歲，屬河南內鄕籍，學行俱佳，體格亦頗强健，春初，偶患咳嗽，經該校校醫診治，稱係感冒，服以阿司匹靈無效。延至上月五日，身體漸感不支，乃入陸軍醫院就治，旋轉往中山醫院，病况略見好轉。詎至本月十三日，工生突自院中寄信，謂該院因所繳之醫藥費用盡，而拒絕繼續施藥，復於十五十七兩日，先後寄信，所述均與前略同，並稱病勢已因醫藥中斷而轉劇。迨至廿四日晨，校方接得該院電吿，謂王生已與世長辭矣。該控訴書末稱：醫院診治病人，責無旁貸，王君之診治情形，即令如該院所云係因欠付醫約費，豈可坐視不救，聽其死亡，於情於理，顯有未合，似此因利忘義，實有故意殺人罪嫌。且經調查結果，王生初入院時，曾遵章預付醫藥費一千萬元（有收據可憑），並曾請准學生救濟會担負王生之醫藥費用，而該院竟稱，僅收到五百萬元，直至最後始確認所繳款之全數（結賬時尙退餘款三百餘萬元）。由此，可證王生之死，實係誤於該院之疏忽，而致醫藥中斷，含冤去世。該會定於今日上午八時，在該校舉行追悼會，會後並招待記者，有所報吿，準備依法起訴，爲死者伸冤。</p>

<h3>市長杯足球複賽　青白淘汰鐵路　一比零十二碼球分勝負</h3>
<p>市長杯足球複賽，靑白昨以一比零擊敗鐵路獲得決賽權，將定期與東華爭奪冠軍。靑白鐵路勢均力敵，爭戰之劇烈，得未曾有，兩隊均未有離樹，上半時完畢前五分鏡，鐵路岳仁孝被罰十二碼，靑白遂以此球奠定勝局。因昨賽之重要，形勢之緊張，不無犯規之處。觀衆計三四千人，逸園相當熱鬧。裁判張樂，巡邊吳守衡陸順德。</p>
<p>鐵路失機</p>
<p>四時起賽，靑白佔得順風之利，撥球先攻，士氣高張，唯奧祺祥缺席，費春華遲到，不免影響實力，六分鐘姜　淸犯規，吳炳浩主罰任意球，秦必高撲住又漏下，林典羲如飛衝上，搭住一射中秦必高身上彈出，鐵路不中此球甚爲可惜，否則局面尙不知如何變化。十五分小羅得球，在廿碼外猛拉，廖雄撲成角球。未幾，小高竄至右翼傳中，小羅一拉斜出。</p>
<p>青白猛攻</p>
<p>此時靑白在鐵路禁贓猛攻不已。但球運欠通，未有建樹，小顧盤過中路，塞與小高，一碰斜出。又一次阿福送與金祿生，盤馬彎弓，一拉又偏出。廿六分，金羅雙騎並進，將球傳進中路，小高舉足待拉，爲密集陣形擋出。小顧再度深入，高挑門前，廖雄躍出接住，又見小羅傳金祿生，沿邊切入，廖衝出撲成角球。</p>
<p>十二碼球</p>

<p>易邊後靑白顧以敝殷慶炳下野，費春華劉體寅入代，鐵路亦以費春林瞿錫根易出徐晟源吳炳浩。兩軍再戰，五分鐘岳仁孝踢姜　清被張樂罰出，鐵路賸十人應戰。瞬息後，小費沿邊深入，勾向中央，阿福一頂斜出，此時塲邊發現無數銀笛聲，擾亂比賽秩序，球賽因之停頓片刻。摜球重賽，小羅祿生二叩均未中的，塲邊笛聲再起，此呼彼應，張樂無可忍耐，決心不再執法，由陸順德瓜代，所遺巡邊之缺，由王重業接替。十九分小羅勾中，小費搭住再傳，劉體寅略一遲疑，又成泡影。</p>
<p>鐵路反攻</p>
<p>鐵路平反心切，犯規纍纍，廿九分吳嘉邦犯手球，阿福主罰任意球，毛腿起處，球出如矢，直逼網窩，廖雄托成角球。卅四分小高截得來球，略盤數武，十五碼處忽施刁射，廖雄慌忙撲出。一分鐘後，小費切入叩關，中柱彈出，小高趕上再拉，高逸而出。此後小費切中一拉出界，金祿生妙傳，小羅鈎中，小高跑空。時間旣屆，鐵路以一球之差飲恨而歸。</p>

<h3>隴東——巨大的磨盤</h3>
<p>今春以來，西北風雨晦鳴，整個軍事態勢，先緊後弛，從陝北到關中西部，再轉到隴東，這偌大的磨盤，使西北實力的存在與對比起了無限的變化。</p>
<p>最初，共匪在宜用戰役中認為他們已完成了一大「勝仗」，這撓倖的「勝仗」仲錯了共匪的頭腦，當作他們必然可獲勝利的佐證，於是他們的作風大變，從偷偷摸摸轉變為大刀闊斧，他們不再運用運動戰，却胆大妄為地企圖用主力來打擊國軍的主力，以期控制關中，孤立西安，威脅西北。</p>
<p>匪軍的大刀闊斧，終於被粉碎了！關中兵團與隴東兵團密切的配合行動，國軍陸空的一致進攻之下，共匪受到巨大的慘重打擊，始則敗放靈山，繼又敗於永壽，土氣幾乎喪失冷盡。國軍馬繼援師攻入屯子鎮的當兒，共匪全部逃竄，不敢有所行動，倉皇中留下了的却是全部重武器，國軍在這兒創造了輝煌的戰績。</p>
<p>總計是役國軍所獲勝利之戰果如次：共匪傷亡二萬七八千人，被俘六千五百餘人，匪第一，第四，第六，三個縱隊司令部及七個旅部全遭擊碎，步槍機槍及電台，亦一併被　獲甚夥。</p>

<h3>文化與政治</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>今年五四運動廿九週年那一天，胡適之先生對記者說過下面一段的話：「五四運動是一個新思潮新文化運動，當時並不是政治運動。那時我們覺得要想提們新文化新思潮，就必須在非政洽的基礎上建立一種新的基礎，所以我們那時的主張是廿年不幹政治……我們當時極力的避開政治，但是政治却不但不能離開我們，反之却來迫我們，以致五四運動慢慢成了帶有政治性的運動……後來政治性就格外的加强了，這也許是好的，也許是壞的，我不願意評論，但文化的意義，就慢慢的削弱了。我個人覺得這個政治化的運動未免太早，因爲力量實在不够。二十九年以來，我個人始終覺得政治的基礎應該建築在文化及思潮的基礎上，從文化方面去努力……」</p>
<p>對於這一席話，在今日局面之下，各人的反應恐怕還是不會一致的。筆者個人對這段談話的反應，簡言之，是——</p>
<p>今日中國的大弊在於亂烘烘與一團糟，致令人起「無從着手」之感。這種現象之形成由於辦事不講究效率；而不講究效率的習氣之養成，是由於事前的沒有以科學的精神去擬定計劃，即使有了計劃，又即使計劃是合乎科學原則的，然而事後又不願有條不紊的做去；這是由於辦事者薰陶的不够，而這也是由於沒有一個文化的新基礎。某西人曾謂我國有許多糾紛，若是在美國，不到一個月便可獲得解決，可是在中國却會成爲燎原之火，不可收拾。這便是因爲美國已經有了那種文化基礎，而中國還沒有的緣故。</p>
<p>當前國是最大的問題，自然是戡亂和經濟二項。可是今日有些人非但沒有解決這二項問題的決心，而且還在以這二個問題爲護身符以遂其私利；更有些人是在以之作爲坐以待斃的「無爲政治」的擋箭牌。「在戡亂時期，只好如此。一「在目前這樣的經濟情形之下，又有什麽辦法！」涵義如此的論調，我們隨處可以聽見。他們是在把一切責任推到這二大問題上去。這使我們回憶起戰前「時値非常」「一切從簡」或「一切從緩」的老調。我們不妨問一句：我們到底有沒有誠心誠意的以科學精神切切實實的在辦事呢？如果我們依照科學化的計劃，有條不紊的幹去，縱使在這二大問題籠罩之下，局面也不致於攪得如此之糟。老實說，今日這兩個問題之所以如此嚴重，還是由於那種「撤爛汚」的習氣所造成的。</p>
<p>於是時至今日，「政治」二字便成了「亂七八糟」的代名詞。</p>
<p>而且這種政治上的風氣竟已蔓延到有些以「文化」「敎育」號召的團體裏面去。嘗思欲求國之治，養成社會良好之風氣最爲要緊。「上有好之者，下必有甚焉。」這是說風氣須自上至下去養成。可是在民主國家，却是民有好之者，上有不得不然焉，乃是自下而上的。自下而上，其本身也即是一種好風氣。我國情形則不然，却是政治上的壞風氣往下傳延，而以「文化」「敎育」爲號召的那些團體所應有的好風氣並沒有向上伸展。換言之，我國的文化是築在政治的基礎上，形成了一個倒豎的金字塔。</p>
<p>這還是因爲我們新的文化基礎還不够堅固不够廣大的緣故。所以胡先生說：「要想提倡新文化新思潮，就必須在非政治的基礎上建立一種新的基礎……政治的基礎應該建築在文化及思潮的基礎上。</p>
<p>很顯然地，這種新的文化基礎不是可以用蠻力立促其成的。只是我們不可以此爲托辭，又回到束手待死的老路上去。今日行憲開始，政府延用文人學者的翁文灝氏主持大政，我們希望這是建築新的文化基礎的開始。</p>
<h3>星期日的煩惱</h3>
<p>— 陳葉</p>
<p>星期日，張小姐，王先生和李太太在北四川路底的車站上等候電車。</p>
<p>車站上人很多，一半是軍人，一半是年靑的女人和男子。女人們都露着手臂，穿着各式各樣的白皮鞋。這是一個有着美好的太陽的星期日。</p>
<p>電車來了一輛，正是張小姐她們所要乘的一路電車。然而因爲人多，大家蜂擁而上，立刻都給擠滿了。接着來了一輛十一路，也裝了一些人。</p>
<p>張小姐她們要到某戲院去看一張呌什麼的影片。李太太還帶了一個小孩。因此；她們想等一輛比較空的車子。十一路走了之後，站上的人本來空了一些，約摸有五分鐘沒有朮來，等車的人又多起來了。看情形不對，她們便試着呌呌三輪車，「××戲院！」「十八萬！」車夫說着做了一個手勢。</p>
<p>電車久久沒有來，　先生又呌了一輛三輪車。車夫要他二十萬。王先生遲疑一下，回說：「十萬！」車夫跨上車子邊走邊說道：「十八萬最少了。」他顯得滿不在乎的輕夷的樣子，王先生簡直有些憤怒了。</p>
<p>一路電車來了，孩子偏哭了起來，李太太一不高興便想打消觀影的主意。略一遲疑，電車上已擠滿了人。王先生喊「三輪車！三輪車！」有輛車子自旁經過，聽說往×戲院嫌路遠，頭也不回走了。王先生出來看戲的興緻也完了，生活上壓積的煩惱便都推上心來，祗催大家回家去。</p>
<p>擠不上電車，看不到影戲，安知非福？或者即使到了電影院買不到票。或者影片並不如理想之好，影片的劇情雖然能够推開現實的困惱，但是沒有多少時候又要回到生活的困愁，現實的牢籠裏來。回來不巧碰着下雨，三輪車的「竹槓」更可怕。賣晚報的人把報紙遞到你面前：「物價又漲了」。本來不愉快的心境，又加深了一層。……</p>
<h3>談故都的吃（上）</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>廣和居的潘魚與江豆腐</p>
<p>廣和居在宣武門外北半截胡同。南城自明以來，即爲士大夫稅居之地，文酒之宴，多在廣和居，故該店所藏乾嘉以來名人聯語詩札甚多，最可愛者，爲名人手書菜單，余在敎育部編審處時，曾數觀之。該店菜以潘魚，江豆腐爲最有名。潘魚即紅燒魚而微帶酸辣，江豆腐則以豆豉薑米等物雜置豆腐中作之，其雋美至今不能忘。日「潘」曰「江」，則發明此菜之人也。潘爲閩人潘炳年（辛未翰林，後放夔州府），爲余友林子有之婦翁，俗謂潘祖蔭者誤。江則江西弋陽人，官主事（江亢虎之父），豆豉乃其鄉味。遜淸末造，盛傳廣和居題壁詩二首，今錄於後，亦該店中一掌故也。</p>
<p>一門兩世作乾爺，喜氣重重出一家，照例自應稱格格，（滿洲語，如漢人稱小姐然。）請安應不負爸爸，岐王宅裏開新樣，江令歸來有舊衙，兒自弄璋翁弄瓦，寄生草對寄生花。</p>
<p>公然滿漢一家人，乾女乾兒色色新，也當朱陳通嫁娶，本來雲貴是鄉親，鶯聲嚦嚦呼爺日，豚子依依戀母晨，別有風情誰識得，諸君何苦問前因</p>
<p>此詩之作，以當時御史江春霖彈章，謂直隷總督陳　龍爲慶親王奕劻之乾壻，安徽巡撫朱家寶爲奕劻子貝子載振之乾兒云云，後以查無實據，著江春霖回原衙門行走。雲貴一語，以朱雲南人，陳貴州人也。自國民政府建都南京，廣和居以營業不振關閉，極爲可惜。</p>
<p>會賢堂的山東菜</p>
<p>會賢堂在後門外十剎海，其地曠野多樹，夏日荷花開時，茶棚羅列賣茶或西瓜冰水之類，爲都人士女消夏之勝地。明代之李西涯相國東陽卜居於此，淸法梧門學士式善詩龍亦在此處，余游學故都時，張之洞居白米斜街，即在十剎海旁，士大夫謁之洞者，往往就食於會賢堂酒肆。肆中菜看不過等於普通山東館，然　欄一望，高柳萬株，積水一泓，其景絕佳。名畫家溥心畬因所居距十剎海甚沂，每觴客必在會賢堂，七七以前某年余省兄故都，心畬飲余於此，同座爲陳散原先生三立，袁伯夔思亮，傅治薌嶽芬，陳病樹祖壬，沈羹梅兆　及余兄蒼虬余弟詢先，酒後同至心畬邸園（恭王府）談藝，夜午始散。今此景猶在目前，心畬園已易主（今為輔仁大學宿舍），會賢堂亦不知尙存在否？</p>
<p>溫的拉麵</p>
<p>故都隆福寺街有一福全館，菜極有名，在先，主人吃福全館，僕人及車夫即吃竈溫，因兩肆相距極近也。此店以拉麵著名，拉麵又名撐麵。端老四（端方別名，故都胡同中老嫗相傳有大榮小那端老四一語，榮爲榮銓，內務府郎中，那爲那桐，後官軍機大臣，端仕至直隸總督。）罷官後，嘗一人往吃，遂爲士大夫吃麵之地。故都吃麵食有名之店，尙有「耳朶眼」在前門外大街，「一條龍」在前門外觀音寺，此兩店以小得名。</p>
<h3>閃電述異</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>某次，據說有一個火滾進了一個女人的臥室，逐漸滾過來，迫近牀舖的時候，把女人的頭髮和上衣都燙焦，火球終於遇到牀脚，爆炸而消滅。</p>
<p>還有一次，空中突然有一股神秘的力量，把門上的一個鑰匙拉出來，恰巧投擲到地板上的一隻鞋子裏。</p>
<p>英國敎　裏的一個打鐘人正想打鐘的時候，鐘樓上忽起一團强烈光圈，因而被阻無法打鐘。這團光圈在祭壇前爆炸，留下了一般硫黄氣息。</p>
<p>以上云云，聽聽神秘，其實乃是我們最熟悉的自然現象——閃電在作怪。科學家雖在殫精竭慮，研究閃電的性能，但關於閃電變化多端的惡作劇，還無從詳其究竟。</p>
<p>閃電曾經在無數次的例子中剝下了人們的衣服，使之裸體，但並不傷及人體。有一次閃電把一條鐵鍊鎔成一根鐵棒，另一次閃電把一名獵人擊斃，但他身上的獵槍却不曾走火。</p>
<p>記錄中最奇怪的一次閃電惡作劇有如下述。一人被閃電所擊，腿上看到兩個縮寫字DD的燃燒痕。救治他的醫師猛然想起數日前他有一隻玳瑁錢夾失竊，錢夾上也有那樣兩個縮寫字。後來那人承認是小偸，閃電擊下來時那隻皮夾正是藏在身邊。</p>
<p>統觀百年來閃電所演的趣劇，正像看一高乘魔術家的畢生經歷一般。閃電把兩個畫框上的鍍金褪去，但並未損及框架和畫幅。兩個女人在結絨綫，一個閃電陡使結綫的竹針急擲遠飛，兩個女人可沒有受到損傷。一隻久已不走的掛表，突然因閃電之襲擊，又開始喞喞復喞喞了。</p>
<p>同一天中：一次閃電把掛在壁上的一面鏡子擊落地上，鏡子沒有破碎；但另一閃電使附近的一所房屋坍倒。在一次盛大的化妝跳舞會中，閃電轟倒了一座烟囪，其中的煤灰把婆娑起舞的男女都染黑了，</p>
<p>關於「球形」閃電的傳說更爲離奇，它有滾進房屋去的習性。有一次，一球火光把城外一所房屋的門推開。另一事件中有一農家女，看到一團火球滾到她父親的牲欄前，她用手去撥弄，火球爆炸，把牲欄中的牲畜全都殺死，獨留那女孩未受損害。</p>
<p>閃電不但能殺害人類，相反地也可以醫治疾病。一個聾子因電擊而復聰，一個瞎子工人因閃電襲擊而重睹光明。另一事件中閃電使癱瘓的手足重行靈活。瘋人會受到電擊而治愈，這種治療簡直與近代心理病態的電療方法一樣。</p>
<p>秘魯傑蘭亭市上有一美麗少女，散步間忽遇閃電襲擊，她雖然沒有受到損害，却變成了一個啞子。</p>
<h3>宿於潛</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>久居城市羨山家，留客鷄啄雲霧茶；盡日潺湲岩谷水，夕陽繞樹亂　鴉。</p>
<p>題雲海圖貽悟宗方丈</p>
<p>名山古剎接雲大，不是人間却似仙；冊載烟霞償夙願，佛家元說是因　。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>回溯晉年三權時代，雖說是鼎足稱尊，而司法爲國務員之一人，司法行政即是國務行政之一支，已不像「香爐腿」的均勢。大理院爲審判最高機關，故院長係特任，與司法部平行，而與大理院並立之總檢察廳則爲司法部之所屬。司法部長與大理院長優崇至於特任，仍不過被任命之高官而已，不能如兩院對於總統之互「咨」，此在體制上實不平衡也。然而司法之獨立，審判之權威，固不全繁於體制，且總統爲代表國家之元首，若拘拘於「三權鼎足」之義，而紛紛用「咨」，亦屬不合，故在彼時個人之感想，於「司法」之「統」於行政糸統，未爲不可，（因爲「統」不必是「屬」。）而於號稱立法機關之兩院之超越均衡，上齊元首，則不無疑義，曾與衆議院秘書長某君，私人談話及此。某君謂兩院對元首除非君主國可與行政官一律用「奏」，若民主國家則只能用「咨」。予曰，國務院與兩議院平行，亦够「立法」與「行政」並尊之身分矣。君等必持「總統爲行政首長」，但遇有國務大事質詢，又何以只請國務總理出席答覆，而不請總統？則總統之不能專於「行政」一而之解釋可知。若謂兩院議長之用咨，爲表示「平行」之尊貴，然則議塲上，議長席之北，何以有爲總統特設，巍然高拱之長背大座椅？何不將此椅移於議長之平行地位，且用尺寸大小與、　長椅一律之椅子乎？某君至此，乃笑而不能答，轉間予之意見。</p>
<p>予曰，說了半天，還是公文程式問題。兩院旣不同行政官吏，不願受「令」，不願用「呈」，則須知文式中原有介乎「上下」之適中辦法。舊時之純然平行如京之各部院堂官，外省之督撫，彼此用「咨」，自無問題。但如「軍機處」，如「總理衙門」，王公大學士所領之機關，則各部各省對之須用「咨呈」，即爲「半平行式」，表示職權上雖非屬史，而體制仍有尊卑之別，是爲盡情盡理。總統來文或用咨，或用照會，如督撫對當地貴紳之例，各盡其道，斯爲妥善。某君曰，民國無「咨呈」之程式。予曰，「咨文」非舊程式乎？然而吾輩私人談話如此，君無訂正程式之權，我亦非上條陳也。於是一笑而另談他事矣。</p>

<h3>Weng Wenhao Takes Office at the Executive Yuan, Announces Li Weiguo and Liang Yingwen as Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, List of Ministers to be Announced Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Weng Wenhao, the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, took office at the Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 29th, and announced Li Weiguo and Liang Yingwen as Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, respectively. As for the complete list of Cabinet members, it could not be announced as scheduled due to the unresolved issues of the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in the Cabinet. However, Weng's nomination by the President was approved by the Legislative Yuan last Monday, so Weng first took office at the Yuan to handle handover matters. This morning, Weng only notified the Executive Yuan by phone and did not make any other preparations. Before 2:30 PM, Gan Naiguang and Pu Xuefeng, the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, went to Weng's official residence on Langya Road to greet him. Soon after, Weng, accompanied by the newly appointed Secretary-General Li Weiguo and Gan and Pu, went to the Executive Yuan. Wang Yunwu, the former Vice-Premier of the Executive Yuan, welcomed him at the Yuan. After arriving at the Yuan, Weng immediately convened a meeting with senior counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan, and introduced the newly appointed Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, and encouraged the original staff of various ministries to continue working with peace of mind. Weng then announced the appointments of Zhou Daxun, Zhang Xiong, and Huang Xian as counselors, and Xu Zhaoji, Xu Zicheng, and Chen Hanping as senior secretaries. Counselor Zhou Daxun will be in charge of confidential documents, and Secretary Xu Zhaoji will concurrently serve as Director of the First Division. Weng then left the Yuan, and the handover procedures are being handled by Li Weiguo, Liang Yingwen, and Gan Naiguang. Furthermore, news of Weng's taking office today was known to few in advance, so not many people came to offer congratulations in time. Vice-Minister Liu Shishun and Education Minister Hang Liwu arrived one after another. Weng also paid his first visit to the President at 9:30 PM to report on matters. It is also learned that Weng has decided to appoint Pu Xuefeng as a councilor of the Executive Yuan. According to Pu, he is willing to serve the Executive Yuan wholeheartedly and does not need to hold any title. However, this decision is unlikely to change.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The list of candidates for heads of various ministries of the new Executive Yuan may be announced on the 30th. As of the evening of the 29th, except for the candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, all have been decided. It was previously rumored that the Ministers of Education, Social Affairs, and Interior Affairs would be changed. It is now learned that Weng has earnestly retained them, and they will remain in their original positions. It was previously decided to invite Jiang Tingfu to serve as Minister of Finance, but Jiang has telegraphed his refusal. Weng has re-consulted with Wang Yunwu to head the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the position of Vice-Premier, it will still be held by Gu Mengyu. Although Gu had previously declined, Weng personally carried a letter from the President when he went to Shanghai on the 27th, sincerely inviting Gu to take the position. It is now open that Gu will take the night train to Nanjing on the 29th. As of the evening of the 29th, although no telegram of acceptance had been received in Nanjing, it is widely believed that Gu's arrival in Nanjing would be to accept the sincere invitation of the President and Premier Weng.</p>

<h3>Xu Fulin Responds to Premier Weng: The Democratic Socialist Party Will Not Join the Cabinet; the Youth Party's Opinion is Given to Lei Zhen to Take to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Democratic Socialist Party has decided not to participate in the new Cabinet under the Constitution, and there is no need to retain the original quota for political councilors. Xu Fulin has directly replied to Weng Wenhao with this opinion. Weng hopes to continue cooperation and retain the quota. Xu and Yang Junming came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th. Xu said that the issue of legislators must be reasonably resolved, but participation in the new Cabinet is unrelated to this. Even if the issue of legislators is resolved, they do not intend to participate in the Executive Yuan, because there are many difficulties in the current political situation, and participation will not improve it. It is better not to participate. The supervisors of the Democratic Socialist Party will also not report for duty for the time being. As for senior advisors and Grand Justices, they can still be considered.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mo Dehui arrived in Shanghai yesterday and immediately visited Zhang Junli at Fan Garden, hoping to break the current deadlock of the Democratic Socialist Party. However, it is learned that the Democratic Socialist Party still insists on resolving the issue of legislators before discussing participation in the Executive Yuan. Yesterday noon, the Standing Committee of the party invited Lei Zhen to a banquet, and exchanged views during the banquet. Lei strongly urged the party to nominate political councilors to participate in the new Cabinet, even if they cannot participate in ministries, but no new suggestions were put forward.</p>
<p>Also, the Youth Party issued a statement last night, stating that whether the party will participate in the new Cabinet still depends on the resolution of the issue of legislators. As of the end of the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 29th, there was no decision on whether to participate or not. The party's official opinion has been submitted to Lei Zhen, and Lei returned to Nanjing by night on the 29th to report.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 29th] Mo Dehui arrived in Hangzhou on the evening of the 29th for sightseeing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Political Councilor Lei Zhen negotiated with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in Shanghai yesterday on the issue of legislator quotas and participation in the new Executive Yuan. In the morning, Lei visited the responsible persons of the Youth Party for detailed talks. At noon, the Democratic Socialist Party hosted a banquet for Lei to express their attitude. It is learned that the Democratic Socialist Party still adheres to its past position on the issue of legislators, demanding that it be resolved according to the original agreement. The party also expressed to Lei its determination not to participate in the new Executive Yuan, but public opinion organizations such as the provincial, municipal, and county councils will continue to participate. Although a few issues of the elected supervisors of the party remain to be resolved, there will be no problem for the party to participate in the Control Yuan.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Financial Department Matters Largely Prepared</h3>

<h3>Yu Youren Does Not Participate in the Control Yuan Presidential Election</h3>
<p>Fourteen More Supervisors Report for Duty</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Fourteen more supervisors reported for duty on the 29th for the first Control Yuan under the Constitution, including Cao Haosen, Chen Fangxian, Yan Zhuang, Yang Hu, and Jin Weixi, bringing the total to fifty-six. The Preparatory Committee's regular meeting on the 29th was not held and was rescheduled for 9:00 AM on the 31st. All subordinate departments will submit specific reports and conduct reviews.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] I recently met with President Yu Youren and inquired about his views on the Control Yuan under the Constitution. President Yu believes that the establishment of the Control Yuan under the Constitution marks the formal launch of the Five-Power Constitution from experimentation. This will surely have a great inspiration in the world's political system. The supervisors of this Control Yuan were mostly elected separately from various places, gathering elites from all over the country. The establishment of the new Control Yuan will surely be able to fully exercise its powers and provide significant assistance to the new political situation. As for himself, he has long resigned as a member of the Control Yuan. After the establishment of this new Control Yuan, he will not only not participate in the election of the new president, but will absolutely not seek any position. This opinion has been repeatedly expressed publicly recently, and I hope that all sectors of society will understand.</p>

<h3>Lapham Will Arrive in Shanghai This Week; Stilman Leads the Industrial Group to Accompany Him; Zhang Jia'ao Serves as a Standing Committee Member of the US Aid Application Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Lapham, the Executive Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration's representative in China, will fly to San Francisco on the 29th after discussing the aid plan with relevant parties here for a week. Lapham is tentatively scheduled to depart from San Francisco on a Pan American Airways plane on June 4th and arrive in Shanghai on the 7th. The construction inspection group (i.e., the Industrial Group) led by Stilman will accompany Lapham. The Central News Agency reporter learned that the technical advisors to the construction inspection group include Moyer, an official of the Foreign Agricultural Relations Department of the US Department of Agriculture, Housting, a well-known railway engineering expert, Parker, an official of the International Finance Department of the Treasury Department who served as Chairman of the US Railway Association in 1939, and Sun Fo Er, the former Economic Advisor to the US Embassy in China.

<p>[Our Dispatch] After Zhang Jia'ao resigned as Governor of the Central Bank, rumors spread that he would actually preside over the application of US aid. Our reporter specifically waited for Zhang yesterday to inquire about the matter. Zhang said, "I am assisting in planning the application of US aid as a standing member of the US Aid Application Committee. The standing committee members were originally the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, and Mr. Miao Yuntai. I have resigned from my position at the Central Bank, but I am still employed as a standing member, and I will do my best as a citizen." Regarding the application of US aid, Zhang emphasized the US view, which emphasizes the combination of self-help and mutual assistance. In this way, the increase in US aid can stabilize prices and stabilize the entire economy. For example, the United States is helping us with food today and also hopes that our country will increase its own production to maintain and expand today's rationing system. The supply of US cotton also expects that our country can increase the production of yarn and cloth, which can be exported in exchange for more raw materials. These two examples can summarize the rest. As for the cash obtained from the sale of materials, with the consent of the United States, it can also be used to subsidize finance and reduce issuance. However, based on the principle of self-help, our country should also increase tax revenue at the same time to cooperate. Zhang finally stated that in order to make US aid effective in stabilizing our country's economy, we must promote the atmosphere of hard work and thrift.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Talks About Import and Export Controls, Advocates Relaxing Imports</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 29th] Song Ziwen recently reported to reporters on his trip to Nanjing, saying that satisfactory results have been achieved regarding US aid for the construction of South China. Lapham, the mayor of San Francisco who is in charge of US aid, will come to China soon, and the detailed distribution plan can be determined. Approximately more than 20 million US dollars can be obtained for repairing part of the Yuehan Railway. When Song was in Nanjing, rumors spread that a special agency would be established to construct South China. He specifically denied this and said that construction in Guangdong Province is already actively underway. For example, the Huangpu Port project has been approved by the central government for 300 billion yuan and self-raised 200 billion yuan and has already started construction. The funds for the highway parallel to the Yuehan Railway have also been secured. The provincial government is now planning to use US loans to install a complete provincial telephone system. A reporter asked him about his opinion on Weng Wenhao's long Executive Yuan. He said that he is currently serving in the local government and should not criticize the central government, but he believes that the new cabinet will have a new policy on finance and stabilizing prices. In addition, regarding the import and export control system, he advocated that imports should be relaxed. As for the issue of exports, the difficulties can be easily solved if the entire currency system problem is resolved. As for the serious issue of the soaring rice prices in Shantou, he said that more than 3,000 bags of rice have been transported to Shantou for relief, and rationing can be implemented there before June 10, at which time rice prices are expected to stabilize.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Refugee Resettlement in Sanmen Bay</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenxiu</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, seeking to provide relief to refugees from all directions arriving in Shanghai, proposed transferring refugees to reclaim and develop Sanmen Bay; it is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs will also support this. Utilizing the surplus labor of refugees to develop national resources, while simultaneously resolving the refugees' livelihood issues, is an extremely wise move. I recall that when the August 13th Incident first erupted, refugees poured into the Shanghai concessions. The former Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Director Pan, together with charitable organizations such as the Renji Shantang, established the Refugee Resettlement Association, providing funds to approximately one thousand refugees to relocate to Jiangxi for reclamation. The results were acceptable, and they still reside in the Gan-Nan area today. This demonstrates that resettlement is a legitimate solution. Currently, Shanghai's capacity to accommodate refugees seems to have reached saturation. Beggars can be seen everywhere on the streets, which is truly a disgrace to the government! If timely resettlement can be implemented, it would not only be a great act of benevolence towards the refugees but also a current need for the Shanghai municipality. The Bureau of Social Affairs is currently widely gathering information on refugee resettlement. Any reclamation plans that can utilize land and the refugees' own labor to solve their livelihoods and achieve the purpose of relief, without consuming large amounts of financial and material resources, are being collected and studied; their destinations are naturally not limited to Sanmen Bay.</p>
<p>Sanmen Bay is one of the coastal bays in Zhejiang, extending from Shipu (a fishing port in the industrial plan) in Xiangshan Port in the north to Kui Pu in the south, and connecting to Taizhou Bay at the mouth of the Ling River. To its east lie the Zhoushan Islands. Dinghai Shenjiamen, famous for its fish market, and Putuoshan, a Buddhist holy site, are part of the Zhoushan Islands. Sanmen Bay uses Shipu as its outlet and Haiyou as its center, with approximately 500 kilometers of coastline facing the sea to the southeast. The voyage from Ningbo to Shipu takes six hours, and the steamboat ride from Shipu to Haiyou also takes several hours.</p>
<p>South of Shipu lies Nantian Island, the only large island in Sanmen Bay. Nantian was a restricted area during the Qing Dynasty. A civilizing commission was established at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and a county was established at the beginning of the Republic, named Nantian County. The coasts of Sanmen Bay were under the jurisdiction of Ninghai County and Linhai County. In July 1940 (Republic Year 29), the Zhejiang Provincial Government established Sanmen County, with Haiyou Town as the temporary county seat, abolishing Nantian County, making it a district of Sanmen County. Sanmen County has jurisdiction over the southeastern part of the former Ninghai County, the northeastern part of Linhai County, and the original area of Nantian County, including the entire Sanmen Bay bay and the coastal land. From then on, the geographical Sanmen Bay and the administrative region of Sanmen County became one. In the past, Sanmen Bay was divided between Nantian, Ninghai, and Linhai counties, making it difficult to coordinate policies and causing variations in progress. Therefore, the establishment of Sanmen County is an important step in developing Sanmen Bay.</p>
<p>Sanmen County has a population of 150,000 (156,840 in 1944), with over half relying on the sea for their livelihoods. The benefits of fishing and salt also account for half of the county's total income. Residents say: "Seeking from the mountains is not as good as seeking from the sea." Every year, during the fishing season, five to six hundred pairs of fishing boats go out to sea to fish, with each pair catching forty to fifty dan of fish each time. The salt fields are mostly located in Jiantiao and Fengpu (South Bay), producing 100,000 dan of salt annually.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Sanmen Bay uses Shipu as its sea outlet and Haiyou as its center. Haiyou is currently the seat of Sanmen County and is connected to Shipu by steamboat, which can transfer to Ningbo and Shanghai. By land, from Haiyou, one can reach Fenghua and Ningbo via Ninghai, or Xinchang, Shaoxing, and Hangzhou via Tiantai, all within a day's journey after the highways are repaired. Major roads and telephones within the county connect to important towns such as Tingpang and Jiantiao. The entire county of Sanmen has approximately 200,000 mu of cultivated land, mainly used for rice cultivation. Ramie and jute are planted on the mountains, and cotton is planted on the newly reclaimed land along the dikes. However, the most noteworthy is the tidal flat, which is the focus of developing Sanmen Bay. The county of Sanmen has over 5,000 mu of tidal flats, including 8,000 mu of Danantian tidal flat, 50,000 mu of Shepan tidal flat, 10,000 mu of Maotou tidal flat, 15,000 mu of Zhengyu tidal flat, 6,000 mu of Laoren Yan tidal flat, 5,000 mu of Jiankangtang tidal flat, and 5,000 mu of Yu'ao tidal flat. The total accumulation of tidal flats, barren mountains, and wastelands in the county exceeds 1.1 million mu. The Zhejiang Province has had a coastal surveying team conduct on-site measurements. Other Daidong birds lay eggs on stones (building materials), which are very salty and can be transported to Shanghai for construction needs.</p>
<p>The economic geography of Sanmen Bay is briefly described above. The area of cultivated land is only one-fifth of the total area, while the benefits of fishing and salt are inexhaustible, as the saying goes, "Ten years of seeking from the mountains is like an instant of taking from the sea." The future of developing Sanmen Bay should be very promising. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan, regarding the construction of a port in Shipu and the development of Sanmen Bay, indeed has foresight, and it is easy to follow and absolutely achievable.</p>
<p>Among the bays and islands along Sanmen Bay, Nantian Island, which has been developed for the past thirty years since the Republic and was formerly the seat of Nantian County and is now the Nantian District of Sanmen County, can be considered relatively mature. Nantian is surrounded by the sea on all sides, with a population of 23,298 (1944). The island has both northern and southern fishing mountains. Throughout the county, whether on the coast or in the mountains, most are barren and bare, while in Nantian District, there are lush forests and bamboo groves on the mountains, and fishing boats are connected at the sea mouth. The residents enjoy both mountain delicacies and seafood, which is unmatched by other coastal lifestyles. This point must be observed from the development history of Sanmen Bay. Nantian was a restricted area during the Qing Dynasty, and a civilizing commission was not established until shortly before the Republic. At that time, the coast of Sanmen Bay was sparsely populated. One reason was that the local residents were not numerous, and another reason was that the coast of Sanmen Bay was the border area of counties such as Ninghai, and the land at the corner of the coast was not paid much attention to. Nantian Island, however, was established as a county after the Republic and gradually prospered. However, the ratio of the productive population to the land's productivity in Nantian District is still insufficient. The 8,000 mu of tidal flat listed above (Danantian tidal flat) are waiting to be developed.</p>
<p>For forty years, the possible ways to advocate the development of Sanmen Bay and the future development of Sanmen Bay have been nothing more than (1) building a military port, (2) building a fishing port, (3) building a city, and (4) agricultural reclamation.</p>
<p>The possibility of building a military port in Sanmen started with Italy's attempt to lease it as a military port during the Guangxu years. Geographically, Sanmen Bay is backed by high mountains on the northwest side of the land, and the bay can avoid wind. Its position is south of 30 degrees north latitude, making it a natural ice-free port. According to the Genxu Marine Survey Report, very deep draft giant ships can be moored. The Eastern Great Port in the Industrial Plan seems to have been intended to replace Shanghai before the unequal Treaty of Nanjing was abolished. Now, the importance of the Eastern Great Port has diminished, but the importance of building ports in Xiangshan Port and Sanmen Bay has increased. The agricultural products along the coast of Sanmen are sufficient to supply the needs of a naval base, and the Haiyou River can be used to generate hydroelectric power to supply electricity, which is sufficient as a condition for a naval base.</p>
<p>Building a fishing port in Sanmen Bay was originally set in the Industrial Plan. The conditions for constructing a fishing port are nothing more than convenient transportation and sales, improved fishing gear, and equipment for fish processing plants and ice-making plants, and the most important thing is abundant fishery production. According to old fishermen in Sanmen Bay, during the fishing season in Sanmen Bay, only three to four tenths of the fish species are caught by fishing boats. If new-style fishing boats can be used, the output can be greatly increased. As for the transportation and sales of fishery products, there is no problem, but the processing and refrigeration equipment is very expensive, and the general public has low knowledge, so the improvement of fisheries and the lives of fishermen is not progressing.</p>
<p>The theory of building a city in Sanmen has also been advocated for many years. The author believes that there is little hope of building a commercial city in Sanmen Bay. Because Sanmen Bay is bordered by the sea on three sides in terms of topography. As far as seaports are concerned, there are Ningbo in the north, and Wenzhou and Taizhou in the south, which are sufficient for the import and export of goods along the coast of eastern Zhejiang. The counties of Tiantai and Xianju, which are adjacent to Sanmen Bay, are both impoverished areas. West of Xianju, Dongyang and Yiwu already belong to the scope of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, so there is no need for Sanmen Bay to be a seaport. Even if the planned Sanyi Railway (Sanmen to Yiwu) is completed, the commercial status of Sanmen cannot replace Shanghai. Precisely because of this, the possibility and necessity of building the Sanyi Railway are also greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The greatest possibility for developing Sanmen Bay is still agricultural reclamation. Agricultural reclamation can resettle the majority of farmers who do not have specialized technical knowledge. There is also a considerable amount of land available for agricultural reclamation in Sanmen, and it is easier to start with agricultural reclamation. Agricultural reclamation must have land, capital, and labor, but given the current social instability, the government's authority is still needed to address security issues. Some of the land in Sanmen Bay is privately owned and has already been cultivated; some has already been claimed by the people but not yet developed; and some is still a tidal flat and needs to be embanked and freshened. Therefore, there must be some reorganization and clearing in terms of land rights and land distribution. In terms of labor, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is natural to utilize the labor of refugees while solving their livelihoods. However, the reclamation of wasteland is certainly a difficult road, without any support. Refugees relying on the city can temporarily survive, but whether the beaches and wastelands, with the tides coming and going, will make the refugees retreat depends on the government's orders. Whether the government can make arrangements and issue calls beforehand seems to be an important issue for resettlement. Therefore, land strength, financial strength, authority, human strength, and military strength can be said to be the prerequisites for resettlement.</p>
<p>Last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Authorities and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration cooperated to reclaim the wasteland on the shores of Mushan Lake in Yuyao, and organized a reclamation committee to take charge. A total of 3,700 mu of wasteland was reclaimed. It is estimated that there will be a harvest this autumn. These 3,700 mu of land have been allocated to 133 farm households, with an average of approximately 20 mu per household. The average yield per mu is two shi of rice (calculated for newly reclaimed land), equivalent to one shi of rice. Twenty mu is equivalent to twenty shi of rice, which can feed an average family of five. How much manpower and financial resources were spent on the reclamation of Mushan Lake? According to reports, 88 tons of work-relief flour from the RRA and 2,000 shi of rice from Yuyao County were spent, using eight traction machines over the course of a year. This is a very practical example. In terms of national wealth, it is beneficial in the coming years; if the current cost and benefit is calculated, this reclamation seems to be a loss. To develop Sanmen Bay, the government must lead, take a broad and long-term view, spare no effort, set up agencies, and use talent before it can be calculated on a schedule. If it is still viewed from the general perspective of seeking profit from capital, then it is safe to say that after fifty years, it will still be the Sanmen Bay of fifty years ago. Objectively speaking, moving to Sanmen is a very urgent need at present; to achieve this need, it itself requires many conditions, and even more, it requires the government and society to be determined to do it.</p>
<h3>Authorities Investigating the Burning Car Incident in Taipei; Compensation for the Deceased Awaits Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 29th] The tragedy of the burning car that occurred yesterday on the Xindian River Iron Bridge, originally named Showa Bridge, in the suburbs of Taipei City, is of great concern to Chairman Wei. He specifically instructed Li Yizhong, the Director of the Social Affairs Department, to visit the injured at the Railway Hospital and Taipei Hospital this morning and provide emergency relief. Regarding the exact number of casualties, according to the Railway Bureau, 23 people were burned to death, 16 died from injuries, and 48 are hospitalized. However, the three passenger cars carried approximately 240 passengers. In addition to the 87 dead and injured who have been accounted for, the whereabouts of the remaining 100-plus people are unknown. According to the Railway Bureau, they have all safely returned home. However, more than 100 family members gathered in the accident area and in front of the two hospitals today, all inquiring about news and the whereabouts of those missing. The reporter will go to the scene again this afternoon to inspect it. Dismembered limbs, wrecked cars, and ashes are everywhere, making it impossible to accurately count the number of casualties. Residents downstream have seen the bodies of passengers who fell into the river floating by, but it has been impossible to retrieve them. Regarding the issue of responsibility, the provincial authorities have begun investigating the cause of the fire. According to the injured, they heard a loud bang at the time and smelled burning celluloid, which was clearly caused by the ignition of camphor powder. As for the fact that the car stopped on top of the bridge, making it difficult for passengers to escape, the Railway Bureau stated that it was caused by the burning of the wind nest, making it impossible to drive. In terms of the aftermath, in addition to the emergency relief from the Provincial Government, the Railway Bureau has set up an inquiry office to allow family members to inquire and register missing injured persons and to bear medical expenses. Coffins will be provided for the deceased first, and the issue of compensation is still awaiting discussion.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Wei recently approved the allocation of 7 million yuan to the Railway Bureau as relief funds for the passengers in distress. The Railway Bureau has also decided to donate approximately 15 million yuan, one day's earnings of all employees on the line, as relief funds.</p>

<h3>Clearing and Suppression Operations Launched in the Siming Mountain Area of Zhejiang; Four Hundred Traitorous Bandits Fight Like Cornered Beasts</h3>
<p>[Our Ningbo Dispatch, 29th] Four hundred traitorous bandits gathered at Shangwanggang in the Siming Mountain area on the morning of the 28th. Upon receiving the report, the Zhejiang Security Brigade dispatched troops to suppress them. The two sides encountered each other and engaged in fierce fighting. The Zhejiang Security Team used howitzers to bombard the bandits. At that time, the bandits occupied the high ground and had a favorable position. The security team soldiers crawled forward, charging upwards five or six times. They charged up the mountain, and the bandits, unable to withstand the attack, retreated towards Duozigang. The soldiers followed and pursued, and the bandits retreated to Xiawoshan. Because the soldiers were chasing closely, the bandits fought like cornered beasts. The fierce battle had not stopped by late at night. The casualties on both sides were heavy and are currently being investigated.

<h3>The Mystery of Yang Mei's Abstinence from Food; Chongqing Medical Circles Hold a Forum; A Heated Debate Occurs; Yang Mei Also Attends as a Listener</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the mystery of Yang Mei's abstinence from food, the Chongqing medical community held a debate with Director Li Zhiyu of the Health Bureau at 4:00 PM this afternoon. An Longzhang, the chairman of the Chongqing Physicians' Association, and Han Mingju, a famous doctor who studied in Germany, have always believed that the Health Bureau's observation methods are not rigorous enough, and they cannot conclude that she has not eaten in the past nine years simply because Yang has not eaten for nineteen days. Huang Yuecong, the director of the Wuhan Liao Yi Hospital, cited the names and times of people who did not eat in history, and stated that short-term fasting can treat epilepsy. Li replied that Yang Mei has not been found to have engaged in any fraudulent behavior. At the time of constitutional rule, only this method can be used for preliminary observation, because the Health Bureau has no reason to force her to enter the hospital. Zhen Maoguang, the director of the Army Hospital, emphasized that it is necessary to research to the end, otherwise it is a disgrace to the scientific community, and science is changing with each passing day. Even if Yang Mei has not eaten for three months, there is no need to worry about overturning science.</p>
<p>Dr. Peng Guangqin firmly stated that science needs to observe facts and draw conclusions from the facts. There is no need to be too curious about Yang Mei. It does not have to be that she does not eat at all to have value. Since she has no habit of eating, this abnormal behavior is worth studying. Furthermore, Hu Xianhua, the director who has been in charge of Yang Mei's observation for the past twenty days, reported Yang Mei's characteristics for the past nineteen days: (1) Her weight has decreased imperceptibly. (2) Her oral temperature is 92 degrees Fahrenheit on cloudy days and 96 degrees Fahrenheit on sunny days, changing with the climate. (3) The first urination contains abnormal substances such as urea, oxygen, etc., such as excess Creatinine. The most interested participant in the meeting was Yang Mei, who arrived at the venue at 4:30 PM to listen and left after sitting for five minutes. She was generous and had no habit of closing her mouth. The scientists respected this fair-skinned, big-eyed girl. When she was listening at the venue, the speakers automatically changed their address to "Miss Yang".</p>
<h3>Eight Labor Heroes in Taiwan Province Receive Award Banners</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] The recently completed Danajiaodong Dike in Tainan and the Beinan Dike in Taitung, Taiwan Province, can be considered models of cooperation between the government and the people in Taiwan Province. Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming presented award banners to eight "Labor Heroes" with outstanding work achievements at a meeting in Taitung yesterday. He also ordered the county government to provide compensation for the two head of cattle that died due to overwork.</p>
<h3>Testing Yang Mei Should Be Divided Into Three Stages: Interview with the Director of Yuzhong Central Hospital</h3>
<p>[Another Telegram] Although the Health Bureau has proven that Yang Mei does not eat, skepticism remains due to the lack of participation of scientists in the observation. Hu Xianwen, the director of Central Hospital during the last ten days, spoke frankly to our reporter about dividing the testing of Yang Mei into three stages: (1) Whether Yang Mei truly does not eat. (2) The different characteristics between Yang Mei after not eating and ordinary people and professional fasters. (3) Why Yang Mei does not eat. Stages (1) and (2) can be carried out simultaneously. Due to objections from the guardian, Zhuo Songdai, only a preliminary 21-day observation of not eating has been conducted. To date, he guarantees with his reputation that Yang Mei has not eaten or defecated. He frankly stated that the existing records of pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, etc., are of little value, and the scales in the Municipal Hospital are also unreliable, with the spring scales being heavy in the front and light in the back. He weighed twice at the same time, and the difference was two kilograms. Therefore, whether Yang Mei's weight has decreased is still questionable. Hu expressed opposition to Zhuo's insistence on sending Yang Mei back to the Jiulongpo Health Bureau to have another nurse continue the observation after 21 days. According to what he knows, Yang Mei is not interested in returning to Zhuo's residence, and rumors that Yang Mei is dissatisfied with the strict surveillance by the nurses are Zhuo's false statements to the outside world. He concluded by saying that if Zhuo insists on his own opinion, he will publish the details to the public after Yang Mei leaves the Municipal Hospital. Hu graduated from Xiangya Medical College and studied in India during the war. He is a famous internist in Chongqing. In addition, Gu Bingliang of the Information Bureau came to Chongqing to photograph Yang Mei, and will fly to Nanjing tomorrow to report.</p>

<h3>Changsha Business News Reports That Private Newspapers Cry Foul After Being Expelled from the Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changsha, 29th] Li Tianshun, the editor of Changsha Business News, became a thief, which aroused public outrage among the employees of various newspapers. They launched a "Liquidation of Newspaper Bosses Movement". The Newspaper Association decided to expel Business News from membership because the newspaper deducted affordable rice and exploited employees. This caused dissatisfaction among the bosses of private newspapers, who believed that the Changsha Newspaper Association was manipulated by a few bureaucratic capitalist newspaper bosses and did everything possible to exploit private newspapers. They gathered on the evening of the 27th. Except for Hunan Zhongxing, which two private newspapers did not participate, the other 19 private newspapers attended the meeting and decided to form the Changsha Private Newspaper Friendship Association, and elected Chen Shifen, the president of the Citizen Daily, and other seven people as preparatory members, which began preparations immediately. After the Business News was expelled from membership, the president of the newspaper, Hou Xuekang, filed a criminal complaint against the association with the local court, and brought up the old matter of the flour case in which various relief sub-bureaus allocated flour to various newspapers in the name of building low-income housing the year before last, and decided to report to the Control Yuan and the court in the capacity of a citizen.</p>
<h3>Hankou Dock Workers' Union Director Detained for Bribing with Bird's Nest and Gold Bracelets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 29th] The dispute between Hejiadun and Dazhimen docks in Hankou, which has been mixed for more than a year, has recently caused a shocking bribery case. According to the representatives of Hejiadun, Gu Qiyin, the director of the dock workers' union, and the representatives of Dazhimen workers, bribed the heads of various institutions with 80,000 silver dollars and some gold bars, respectively, in order to protect themselves. The Bureau Chief Ren of the Police Bureau, who was also identified as one of the targets of the bribery, also frankly admitted that Yin had indeed bribed him with a pair of gold bracelets and a box of bird's nests, but he had sternly refused to accept them and had already returned them through someone. As a result, Mayor Xu and the heads of various institutions were even more shocked and wanted to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to clear their names. Ruan Qi, the commander of the garrison, even ordered the arrest of the bribers and dealt with them according to law, in order to clarify the truth. According to reports, this case has been noisy for a long time, and the Control Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense have both started investigations. The public generally praises Bureau Chief Ren's integrity and courage to reveal the truth.</p>

<h3>Marshall Accuses the Soviet Union of Malicious Propaganda: Obstructing US Efforts for Peace: The Foundation of US-Soviet Negotiations Was Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Reuters Portland, Oregon, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall gave a speech to the Federation of Women's Associations here on the 28th, accusing the Soviet government of deliberately and maliciously engaging in propaganda campaigns to obstruct the United States' efforts to launch negotiations in good faith to resolve world problems. He said that if the Soviet government could abandon certain practices and actions that have plunged the world into unrest and disorder, it could create a new atmosphere in the international community, and the United States government would never ignore it. Marshall also told the American people that the European people are now afraid that the United States is unreliable, and deeply fear that the United States will change its will and abandon the European recovery plan. But he also said that since the beginning of this year, good progress has been made in obtaining peace and security and restoring world prosperity. He believes that if the United States continues its firm policy, it will be able to solve the worst difficulties and establish a perfect foundation for peace. He is convinced that only this firm path can save the status of democracy. When Marshall mentioned the enthusiastic discussions in the United States regarding the recent exchange of documents between the United States and the Soviet Union, he pointed out that those engaged in these discussions have ignored the fact that the Soviet government is launching a deliberate and malicious propaganda offensive against the United States to undermine the United States' efforts to find a basis for negotiations to resolve world problems in good faith. It should be noted that the recent statements made by Foreign Minister Molotov and Premier Stalin, which have specific purposes, are intended to gain propaganda benefits and make the United States, that is, the world, distort the United States' sincerity in seeking understanding. The United States government must maintain its consistent principles of action. The United States government must not take actions that may be effective for a while but damage the integrity of the United States' future policies, and at the same time hopes that the American people will not be deceived by propaganda actions that do not reveal the facts. The methods of modern totalitarian propaganda create the impression that actions that do not represent the true situation or success are possible. Past negotiations have failed to achieve the cooperation needed to stabilize the world situation and develop a basis for peace. There is now a strong demand in the United States for agreements to eliminate the fear of war and restore normalcy. Therefore, any statements that lack practical action and are insincere are met with outrage. He believes that no one is more determined than him to obtain peace and security and restore world prosperity. However, in his capacity as Secretary of State, he must not allow the United States to be driven by temporary emotions and accept obligations or actions that threaten its future. The fear in Europe is actually due to a misunderstanding of the way American policies are developing. Today's world is in a state of deep unrest. The unfortunate people of the world already know that their interests cannot be compared with those of other nations. If they are not given some hope, they may not be able to avoid a frenzy, because this unrest will be the ideal environment for those who advocate violence to operate.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu's Speech Describes the Situation in China</h3>
<p>[United Press Portland, Oregon, 28th] Dr. Jiang Tingfu, China's representative to the United Nations Security Council, said in a speech to the Portland City Association today that although the situation in China is similar to that of Russia in 1917, the Chinese people are fond of individual freedom, so he believes that China will not become a communist country. He said, "In terms of territory, population, illiteracy, lack of democratic experience and extreme poverty, Russia in 1917 and China in 1948 are very similar."</p>
<p>In addition, both countries have an intellectual class studying abroad and different foreign ideas, many of which are not suitable for China." Jiang said that the biggest difference between the two countries is that the Chinese love individual freedom and that China has no large landlords. He declared that the Chinese people living under communist rule are afraid of communism like snakes and scorpions, and millions of people often flee from the communist areas to the National Army areas, and no one flees in the opposite direction. Jiang said that due to the difficulty of implementing rationing and direct taxes, it is difficult to control China's inflation. He said, "It seems impossible to ration goods consumed on the spot, and land owners and bank deposits in China often use multiple names to open accounts, so direct taxes are also almost impossible to implement. One person can own countless seals, so the true owner of land deposits cannot be revealed."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Violates Agreements 37 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 29th Broadcast: Washington News, The Senate Foreign Relations Committee said today that the government accused the Soviet Union of violating international agreements 37 times in Europe and the Far East since the end of the war, including 7 related to Germany, 6 related to Austria, 4 related to Bulgaria, 3 related to North Korea, and 1 each related to Hungary, Romania, Manchuria, and Poland.

<h3>Wallace Condemns US Anti-Communist Bill</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th] Henry Wallace, the presidential candidate of the Third Party, testified in the Senate Judiciary Committee today, condemning the anti-communist bill as a "declaration of war" against American rights, and said that if the bill becomes law, the Third Party does not intend to obey. Wallace also said that this measure undermines the basic guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. He denounced the anti-communist bill passed by the House of Representatives as "full of falsehoods," and although it claims to prevent autocracy, it "makes the United States Attorney General the dictator of every organization in the country." Wallace claimed that he and his party advocated US-Soviet "peace talks," so they are at risk of being fined and imprisoned under the bill. Wallace reiterated that the target of the anti-communist bill is not communism but democracy.</p>
<h3>Berlin Allied Military Government to Cease to Exist</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Ended Unhappily</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 29th] In an atmosphere of East-West hostility, the four-power Berlin military government ended unhappily after meeting for 15 hours. Signs indicate that the four-power military government will soon cease to exist.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 29th] The Berlin Four-Power Joint Command met at 10:00 am Berlin time on the 28th and ended at 1:15 am on the 29th, lasting 15 hours and 15 minutes. The only agreement reached was to agree to suspend the meeting for lunch at noon and to suspend it for tea and snacks in the afternoon. All items on the agenda were removed from the agenda because no agreement was reached. During the discussion, British representative Major General Herbert once accused the Soviet representative of deliberately circling and not being sincere in the discussion. He also pointed out that the Soviet side requisitioned labor and used it to mine uranium in Saxony. He also said that production in the Soviet zone has declined sharply, and taxes are heavy, with each person paying 450 marks in taxes, while each person in the Western zone only pays 270 marks. The total tax revenue in the Soviet zone is 8 billion marks, and 6 billion pounds are requisitioned by the Soviet authorities for compensation, occupation fees, and other expenses. US representative General Hollett also said that 45% of the industrial production in the Soviet zone of Berlin is produced for the benefit of the Soviet Union. According to the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command, it is the only four-power institution still operating in Berlin. The Four-Power Allied Control Council has been suspended since the Soviet representative withdrew from the meeting on March 20.</p>

<h3>After the Surrender of Jewish Forces in the Old City of Jerusalem, Arab Forces Continue to Besiege the New City: Jewish and Arab Forces Engage in a Decisive Battle in Latrun</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Jerusalem, 29th] Following the capture of the Old City of Jerusalem, the Arab Legion, led by the King of Transjordan, has besieged the New City of Jerusalem and is bombarding Jewish strongholds with mortars and heavy artillery.</p>
<p>Another part of the Arab forces is advancing towards the Latrun area on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, completely isolating the Jewish forces in Jerusalem and preventing essential supplies from reaching the Jewish defenders. Arab tanks, mortars, and reinforcements are continuously entering the Latrun area. At the same time, Egyptian aircraft are bombing Jewish concentration areas in Hulda and Shaar Hagai, four miles west of the area. It appears that the Transjordanian forces are adopting the same tactics that won them the victory in the Old City of Jerusalem to attack the New City, namely cutting off outside aid and attacking internally until surrender. Arab officials claim that among the 2,500 Jews who surrendered in the Old City, 500 were combatants and 2,000 were women and children. The 500 combatants were transported by truck to a prisoner-of-war camp near Amman on the evening of the 25th, while the women and children are being detained by relief organizations.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Hulda, 29th] On the 29th, Israeli forces, using an entire armored brigade and air force, are confronting the Arab Legion in Latrun, striving to open the Jerusalem highway lifeline and reinforce the Israeli defenders in the New City of Jerusalem. Every mortar, field gun, armored vehicle, and aircraft under Israeli command has been rushed to the front line to strengthen the Israeli offensive. The elite troops of King Abdullah's Arab Legion are now firmly defending Latrun, having been ordered to hold the highway and not be overrun by the Jewish reinforcements attempting to relieve the siege of the New City of Jerusalem. All indications now suggest that the Arab Legion, trained by the British, and the Jewish veterans of the British Army will soon engage in the first armored battle of the Palestine war on the Shephelah plain. The battlefield is located on the eastern edge of the Shephelah plain, about eight miles southeast of Rehovot. The commander of the Jewish forces at the front is a former high-ranking British military officer.</p>
<h3>The Security Council Will Vote on Three Resolutions on the Holy Land Proposed by Britain, the Soviet Union, and France; Our Representative Supports the British Proposal for a One-Month Truce</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Lake Success, New York, 29th Broadcast: Soviet Representative Gromyko today launched another major attack in the Security Council against the policies of other countries regarding Palestine, strongly advocating the adoption of the Soviet proposal for strong United Nations intervention in the situation in the Holy Land. Gromyko pointed out that the American proposal violates the resolutions of the General Assembly and is therefore illegal if adopted. British Representative Jebb retorted, calling Gromyko's accusations malicious insults. Both the British and Soviet proposals are unlikely to pass. The Security Council has decided to first put the Soviet proposal to a vote.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] The Security Council is scheduled to resume discussion of the Palestine issue on the 29th to find ways to halt the fighting there. There are three draft resolutions pending discussion by the Security Council: one is the British resolution, which calls for a four-week truce and prohibits the import of any weapons or armaments into Palestine; one is the Soviet resolution, which calls for the Security Council to order both sides in the Palestine conflict to cease fire within 36 hours, otherwise, it will recognize that the situation there has already disrupted peace and implement sanctions in accordance with the Charter; and one is the French resolution, which calls for the United Nations to implement sanctions if the ceasefire order cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 29th] The United Nations Security Council will vote on the Palestine issue on the 29th. The Soviet proposal currently has only five votes of the necessary seven-vote majority. As for the two votes from Belgium and Argentina that could enable the Soviet proposal to pass, it is rumored that they are still hesitating before the final vote. United Nations officials believe that even if the Soviet proposal can obtain seven votes, it will not guarantee that Britain will not use its veto power.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 28th] When the Security Council resumed discussion of the British and Soviet resolutions on Palestine on the 28th, the opinions of the representatives were quite divergent. China and Canada both supported the British proposal for a one-month truce. American officials in Washington stated that the British proposal could serve as a basis for improving British-American relations. They also said that the Soviet proposal, which calls for the Security Council to take coercive action, is unlikely to be passed by the Security Council. The United States will still vote in favor of the British proposal at that time. Ukrainian Representative Tarasenko pointed out that the British resolution clearly favors one side against the other.</p>
<h3>Bevin Does Not Wish to Argue About the Holy Land Issue</h3>
<p>Britain Denies It Is Studying New Methods</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in an address to the Women's Labor League, stated that he has not participated in the verbal debates about Palestine in the United States and elsewhere because he is working to find opinions that he believes will ultimately lead to a resolution of the Palestine issue. He pointed out that considerable progress has been made in efforts to develop peace and coordination around the world. He then said: "Even in war-torn Palestine, people are eager for a resolution to the problem." Referring to economic issues, he said that with the assistance of the Marshall Plan, Britain and other countries will easily be able to restore production and living standards to pre-war levels, which is what everyone deeply hopes for.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Foreign Office recently denied rumors that the British government is studying new methods to resolve the Palestine issue, which will be submitted to the United States government. The spokesman believes that United Nations-appointed Palestine mediator Bernadotte will easily facilitate negotiations between the Jews and Arabs.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Faces Another Crisis: Requests a Vote of Confidence on the Dismissal of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Prime Minister Schuman, who is seeking a vote of confidence from the parliament for the bill to allow the government to dismiss 150,000 civil servants, is facing a dangerous new threat. This new crisis arose because Prime Minister Schuman and Minister of Health Madame Chabouis of the Popular Republican Movement signed an order some days ago that indirectly allowed national public funds to subsidize children in church schools. Schuman and Madame Chabouis did not consult with the Socialist and Radical Party cabinet members before signing the order. It is heard that the Socialist Party intends to demand the revocation of the order as a condition for voting confidence in Schuman. The Popular Republican Movement is now working behind the scenes, hoping to pass the vote of confidence next Tuesday. If he unfortunately fails to gain a vote of confidence, Schuman, who has threatened to resign six times in just seven months in office, will have to step down.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] After the leader of the South African National Party, Malan, defeated Smuts in the general election and is about to form a new cabinet, he will also be invited to attend the Commonwealth conference with Smuts. Britain may not be able to remain neutral on the South African issue, as every Commonwealth country maintains close ties with London. Malan's victory has caused extreme anxiety in British political circles, as the party is known for being anti-British, anti-black, anti-Jewish, and pro-Nazi.</p>

<h3>To Adapt to Atomic Warfare: The United States Plans to Train New Troops; Research on Fluid Tactics in the Far East Zone Completed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Camberley, Surrey, 29th] Senior officers of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force held a week-long "paper exercise" at the Staff College here to study the "design and execution of fluid tactics in the Far East theater of war." After the exercise, Field Marshal Montgomery, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, gave a speech to reporters, discussing his views on reforming the British Army after the war. He believes that a true state of preparedness is more necessary now than ever before. He pointed out that the post-war army must be composed of three parts: the regular army, the national guard, and trained equipment troops. A regular army and local equipment troops alone are not sufficient to meet the challenges of modern warfare. The post-war army must undergo fundamental reforms to establish a superior national army that can be sent to the front lines at any time. In addition, an air defense organization must be established as soon as possible to cope with air threats.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report on Aid to China (Part 5)</h3>
<p>China's Self-Help Measures and Guarantees</p>
<p>To ensure that foreign aid is effective, the Chinese government itself must be able to determine its policies to enable China to gain strength and stability. A government that cares for the interests of the people is less susceptible to external forces. Therefore, when taking favorable action on the issue of aid to China, the committee was deeply impressed by the statement made by Premier Chang Chun in Nanjing on January 28, 1948.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In the committee's opinion, the National Government of China, under the twenty years of arduous leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has become our common ally to cope with threats to international peace and security and communist aggression. The further assistance approved by our government demonstrates the United States' concern for China's independence and integrity, the welfare of the Chinese people, and the stability and peace of the Far East.</p>
<p>Appendix</p>
<p>Analysis of the Aid to China Bill and Relevant Provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948:</p>
<p>Section 2: This section outlines the objectives of the proposed bill and the methods of providing aid to China. The objectives of this bill are to assist China in alleviating human suffering, preventing economic deterioration, and enabling the Chinese people to have the opportunity to initiate self-help measures to rebuild the foundation for economic stability. This assistance is based on the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948. These provisions are consistent with the objectives of this bill, and the objectives of the bill do not mean that China must comply with the common plan for European recovery in order to obtain aid to China under the bill. Aid to China will be based on the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948 that are relevant to the objectives of this bill and the situation in China. The methods and scope of assistance are the same as those for countries participating in the European recovery plan. Therefore, the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act will apply to China, irrespective of the objectives of that act, but only in relation to the objectives of this bill.</p>
<p>Section 3: Item (A) of the section on the Aid to China Bill authorizes the appropriation to the President of an amount not exceeding $3 million, which may be utilized within one year from the date of the bill's implementation, to comply with the various objectives to which the Economic Recovery Act can be applied, without regard to the various provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 1948. The funds appropriated under this item may be used to assist China by way of grants, thereby promoting the various objectives of this bill. The procedure to be followed is that which the President considers sufficient to promote these objectives.</p>
<p>Section 4: This section stipulates that an agreement must be signed with China, including China's provision of guarantees to the United States. These guarantees, after consultation between the Secretary of State and the Economic Cooperation Administrator, may be considered necessary for the implementation of the various provisions of this bill, as well as for improving commercial relations with China (including giving American financial enterprises equal opportunities).</p>
<p>It is expected that when negotiating this part of the agreement, to make the funds allocated under Item (O) of Section 3 of this bill available to assist China, the Executive Branch should proceed in accordance with Section 15 (B) of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, to the extent applicable to China, but without being subject to all its restrictions. For example, matters included in paragraphs 5 to 8 of Section 15 (B) of Senate Bill 2202, as passed by the Senate, are expected to be applicable to China only after the text of these paragraphs has been slightly revised. As for paragraphs 1 to 8 of that bill, they may be applicable to China after varying degrees of revision, but some parts of them must be revised to the point of being completely rewritten.</p>
<p>Section 5: This section authorizes the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to advance funds, not exceeding a total of $5000, in order to implement the various provisions of this bill, pending the disbursement of funds under Item 3 of this bill. (End)</p>
<h3>Tentative Plan for Western European Highway Network Prepared</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The State Department recently revealed that the Inland Transport Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which met in Geneva in April, has prepared a tentative plan for the establishment of a Western European highway network. Participants in the meeting included France, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the British and American zones in Germany. The plan envisions the construction of interconnected highway lines from Scandinavia south to Italy and from the Atlantic coast to Hungary, with the proposed highway lines passing through the "Iron Curtain" at four points in Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. However, the State Department explained that although the highway lines passed by countries that did not participate in the Geneva conference were also proposed at the meeting, no action will be taken to incorporate the highways of these countries into the international highway network until agreements have been reached with these governments. The State Department also said that many existing autobahns in Germany and Italy will be incorporated into this system, and efforts will be made to reduce border crossing restrictions in the countries through which the international highway network passes to facilitate the transport of passenger cars and trucks.</p>

<h3>Trial of the Social Affairs Bureau Riot Case Concluded: Sentence to be Pronounced on June 3rd; Lawyers Vigorously Attack: Improper Application of Regulations; Defendants Kneel and Plead for Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The debate hearing for the case of the dancers and dance hall workers who rioted at the Social Affairs Bureau was held in the Special Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. At around 2:00 PM, Judge Wang Zhennan, Judges Sun Tiqian and Xu Naikun, and Clerk Xu Leshi took their seats. Thirty-seven defendants in custody and thirty-two defendants released on bail were brought before the court. Those released on bail stood on the right side of the court, while those in custody stood on the left side of the court. The attorneys appearing for the defense included Chen Tingrui, Zhou Yizhi, Ma Junshuo, Fu Kuangshuo, Zhang Guangzong, Zhu Wende, Huang Zengjie, Tao Ran, Xia Xintang, Shi Zhuoren, and female attorneys Zhang Hongwei, Li Suzhen, and Hua Xizhen, totaling sixteen. After the lawyers presented their defenses on behalf of the defendants, the hearing concluded at 5:30 PM. The court announced that the sentence in the case would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on June 3rd.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the central focus of the debate was the lawyers' strong legal challenge to the police bureau's application of Article 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Endangering National Security during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion, deeming it improper to refer the defendants to the Special Criminal Court for processing.</p>
<p>Attorney Zhou Yizhi first provided a general explanation of the defense's arguments, stating in brief: "The formation of this case is due to the serious unemployment problem. After the ban on dancing, tens of thousands of people will inevitably fall into unemployment. Driven by the pressure of livelihood, they had to resort to petitioning. Furthermore, there is fundamentally no reason for the ban on dancing. (1) Dancing has long obtained legitimate business status. Now, a mere order deprives people of their right to work and survive, and there are no good methods for them to transition to other jobs. It seems that the administrative authorities lacked deep consideration when issuing this order. (2) Some say that the ban on dancing is for the sake of thrift, but there are many things that should be saved. The government does not choose the most important things to save on and instead bans dancing first, which is truly neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial. (3) Taking a step back, even if dancing should be banned, it must go through legal procedures. The Legislative Yuan should first formulate a law banning dancing, pass it, and then implement it step by step, which would be legal and reasonable. Moreover, Article 155 of the Constitution states that the government should protect the people's occupations. Now, causing those with occupations to become unemployed is also a violation of the Constitution. The proximate cause of this case is that the Social Affairs Bureau did not follow the regulations to draw lots on the afternoon of January 31st, but instead drew lots in the morning, thus the Social Affairs Bureau had already lost faith with the people first. It is even more improper for the police bureau to refer this case under Article 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Endangering National Security. Upon investigation, what is included in Article 7 is Item 7 of Paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits: 'Intending to disrupt public order by arson, flooding, or other methods of destroying public offices or military equipment.' To apply such a severe article to a group of pitiful people who are petitioning for their livelihood is truly making a mountain out of a molehill and using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Request that the court declare the defendants not guilty or transfer the case to the District Court for handling. Also, the defendants in custody have been detained for more than four months, and their suffering has reached the extreme. Please grant bail."</p>
<p>Male and Female Defendants Weep Uncontrollably</p>
<p>When Attorney Zhou spoke with fervor, the defendants in custody wept uncontrollably. Even the male defendants, who do not easily shed tears, sobbed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Attorney Chen Tingrui also argued, pointing out the impropriety of the police bureau's application of the Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Endangering National Security during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion. He also stated: "The police bureau took three months to investigate before sending the case to your court. However, after examining the case, there is no human or material evidence, direct or indirect evidence. As a result, the police bureau also felt that this matter was inappropriate. They then used the female student Jin Ying as an excuse, believing that there must be someone instigating behind the scenes. However, after investigation, Jin Ying had no communist suspicions, and the police bureau released her on bail. To release Jin Ying, who is believed to be the instigator, on bail, while the thirty-seven defendants who are believed to be instigated are still detained is utterly unreasonable."</p>
<h3>It is Difficult for One or Two People to Bear Responsibility for the Actions of Thousands</h3>
<p>He continued to list various factors, both remote and proximate, that led to the incident, saying that exacerbating the matter was definitely not the fault of the chairman of the labor union. To make one or two people responsible for the actions of thousands of people is not legally sound. Finally, he also criticized the police bureau, saying: "During the detention of the defendants in the police bureau, their families applied to the District Court for a habeas corpus petition. On March 4th, the District Court issued a writ of habeas corpus, but the police bureau ignored it. It is not known how to explain their extra-legal behavior."</p>
<h3>Tang Zongjie Did Not Take Action</h3>
<p>Attorney Fu Kuanglin argued: "Regarding the part of the defendant Tang Zongjie, upon investigation, the Joint Office of Dance Industry is an organization jointly formed by five units. The defendant has only one-fifth of the responsibility, and there are a total of fifty people in the presidium. The defendant has only one-fiftieth of the responsibility. The police bureau's investigation report also contains the words 'Tang Zongjie dissuaded the other dancers from acting rashly.' Since he dissuaded, he must not have taken action, which can be determined. Secondly, regarding the point of whether Tang is a member of the Communist Party, Tang is a loyal worker of the Kuomintang Youth League, and there is already a letter proving this. This point also falls apart."</p>
<p>Attorney Hua Xizhen also defended Tang Zongjie, requesting that the entry of the word 'Tang' in the record book be authenticated, as the handwriting is inconsistent and clearly added later. Attorney Ma Junshuo stated: "According to the police bureau's investigation report, the defendants Zha Ruiyong, Su Jinsheng, and Yu Jinbao were merely tidying up things and cannot be said to be robbery. How can the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and the Emergency Punishment Law be used?"</p>
<h3>"Pockmarked Face" Creates Great Laughter</h3>
<p>Attorney Huang Zengmu defended the pockmarked dance hall girl Tan Pei'e: "The pockmarked face that beat the Social Affairs Bureau is not the pockmarked face of the defendant. According to reports, the pockmarked dance hall girl who beat the Social Affairs Bureau had a slightly pockmarked face and wore a red Shanghai cheongsam. The defendant is very severely pockmarked and does not like to be in the limelight, so she dresses simply and never wears red clothes. From this, it can be known that this pockmarked face is not that pockmarked face. The pockmarked face that beat the Social Affairs Bureau slipped away long ago." Attorney Huang said "pockmarked face" a dozen times in a row, causing great laughter in the court. He also brought Tan Pei'e forward, and Judge Wang examined her carefully.</p>
<p>The remaining Zhang Hongwei, Li Suzhen, and others also defended the defendants on their behalf. After the lawyers finished their arguments, Judge Wang asked the defendants if they had any opinions. Zhu Lin, the first person transferred by the police bureau, raised his hand, stating that he had not instigated anything, and knelt down to request bail. The remaining thirty-six defendants also knelt down together to request bail, creating a chorus of voices. The defendants' families in the audience also cried loudly. Judge Wang quickly said: "Speak properly, everyone stand up." Subsequently, he announced that the sentence in the case would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on June 3rd. Bail was not granted to the defendants in custody, and they were returned to detention. The court adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>

<h3>Identity of Over a Hundred People Suspect in West Guangfu Road Census</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The police bureau dispatched a large number of census police officers yesterday, led by Census Section Chief Wu Yan, along with New Jing Branch Chief Zhang Shixiong, to conduct a surprise census on West Guangfu Road in a blitz style. The area is adjacent to Xin Jing, Da Chang, Zhenru, and Zhabei and has always been known as a "no-man's land." Refugees, beggars, bandits usually come and go, forming a breeding ground for crime. As a result of the surprise inspection, it was found that most of them had not registered their household and that the identities of more than 100 people were suspicious. In addition to ordering those who had not registered their household to register quickly, the police bureau took those whose identities were suspicious back to the bureau for interrogation.

<h3>Police Monitor and Prohibit Worship of Stone Statues; Pious Men and Women Curse the Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, because the incense offerings to a pair of stone statues in front of the racecourse have become increasingly popular recently, greatly obstructing the appearance of the city and traffic, started yesterday to send two police officers to stand guard in front of the two statues to prevent ignorant people from going to burn incense and worship. The general believers were unable to approach the "spirits" and were greatly frustrated. Some even vented their anger on Bureau Chief Yu Shuping, privately talking hatefully, saying: "Yu Shuping has cut off the incense offerings to the bodhisattvas. The bureau chief will soon be unable to continue in his position." Their words are quite laughable.</p>
<h3>西園寺外電車停頓 肇事五士兵被捕</h3>
<p>[By our reporter] Yesterday at approximately 4:50 PM, an English-owned No. 324 trolley bus, number nineteen, was passing by the Nicheng Bridge on Beijing Road when it encountered a red light. Suddenly, four soldiers insisted on boarding the bus. Wang Guoyou, ticket seller number 2507, stated that it was inconvenient to open the door at that location and requested they board across the street in front of the Sino-French Pharmacy. The soldiers were displeased. When the light turned green and the bus began to move, the four soldiers rushed to board. After getting on, they scolded Wang, slapped his face, and threatened to beat him again when the bus passed their unit on the return trip. The four men rode for two stops and then got off. When the bus reached the Kunming Road terminal, Wang informed Yang QiHuai, the ticket seller on the No. 390 bus in front, that he feared trouble on the return trip. Following a suggestion, Wang and another ticket seller, Huang Guangqing, switched buses, so Wang ended up on the No. 390 bus. Not long after, that trolley bus turned around and arrived at the Xiyuan Temple gate on Chengdu Road (where new recruits were stationed). Sure enough, it was surrounded by dozens of soldiers, who dragged Wang off the bus and beat him. Soon after, the No. 324 bus also arrived, and the soldiers attacked Huang Guangqing and Yang QiHuai, taking Yang inside the Xiyuan Temple. At this moment, a No. 16 trolley bus from Caojiadu arrived, and the driver, Wang Zhenren, tried to escape, but was caught by the soldiers. By this time, over a hundred No. 16, No. 18 trolley bus, and No. 123 streetcar drivers and ticket sellers had heard the news and rushed to the scene, their emotions running high as they planned to storm the Xiyuan Temple to rescue their captured colleagues. Just as the situation was becoming critical, the military police, the Flying Fortress unit, the Deputy Chiefs Zhao Peijin and Ding Zhenduo of the Xincheng Branch Bureau, Section Chief Hao, and Zhang, the Captain of the Traffic Brigade, arrived with police officers to mediate. As a result, after Director Zhao and Section Chief Hao, along with Zhang Fengyuan, the Major Deputy Battalion Commander of the Supplementary Regiment's Second Battalion, and Qiu Changjiang, the Chairman of the Trolley Bus Workers' Union, went to the military unit to confer with Platoon Leader Chen, Platoon Leader Chen agreed to hand over soldier Zhao Wenxuan, who was involved in the incident, to Director Zhao to be taken back to the Xincheng Police Station. At the same time, Wang Zhenren and Yang QiHuai were released. Subsequently, based on Zhao Wenxuan's testimony, it was learned that other assailants were in the troop unit at the Baobentang Church on Changsha Road. The injured were taken to identify them, and Cui Qinglin, Liu Weiguo, Du Lanchen, and Wang Xiangdao were arrested and taken to the Xincheng Branch Bureau. Wang Guoyou, Huang Guangqing, Wang Zhenren, and Yang QiHuai, who were injured, were rushed to the hospital. By 8:30 PM, the disturbance had gradually subsided and traffic was restored. The five offending soldiers were transferred to the Police Department that night for further investigation.</p>
<h3>黃鳥千餘頭展開大廝殺 春風得意樓今晨盛會 「常勝將軍」重上征塲</h3>
<h3>Over a Thousand Yellow Birds Engage in a Fierce Battle: Grand Gathering at Chunfeng Deyilou This Morning; "Ever-Victorious General" Returns to the Battlefield</h3>
<p>[By our reporter] This city's annual Yellow Bird Competition will commence at 9:00 AM this morning at the Chunfeng Deyilou teahouse in the Old City of Nanshi. Over a thousand yellow birds will participate, representing over sixty units from various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Last year's champion, the "Ever-Victorious General," has now been transferred from its former owner, Wang Daji, to a certain bird-raising expert in Dongxinqiao. It will make an appearance today to try to reclaim the championship. The event is organized by the Shicun Society, founded by Jiang Futian and others, aiming to promote leisurely cultivation of character and demonstrate that "even small birds possess martial ambition; how can men be without aspirations?" The atmosphere surrounding the event is as intense as a large-scale sports meet. The yellow bird contestants must be numbered. They are divided into "new" and "old" (those born last year are considered new birds, while those born before last year are old birds; they compete in separate categories, akin to boxing matches). Eight rules are prominently displayed: "New and old birds do not fight each other; do not regret any oversight," "Those who bite the crotch, tail, or peck feathers should promptly withdraw after self-inspection," "If one only flips and doesn't fight, it should be considered a retreat from the battlefield," "If one accidentally slips and falls, the competition must continue," "Minor adjustments to the silk are permissible, but do not make independent modifications," "Do not stop arbitrarily; follow the referee's instructions," "Be careful not to let the bird escape when dismantling the cage, to avoid mutual blame," "If the silk tangles in the cage, the referee will kindly separate them." Four types of prizes are displayed: exquisite tea sets, sandalwood bone fans, red and yellow flower tickets, and silver shields in brocade boxes. The competitions are organized by county, with the names announced before the birds enter. If a bird ranks highly, the county's escorts will consider it a supreme honor for their region. Following the competition, another exciting event will take place: the Suzhou "Guwu Huangdao Joint Society" has notified the organizers, planning a Shanghai-Suzhou battle on June 7th at the Suquan Teahouse in Suzhou, with a challenge stating: "We have prepared a small amount of rent, enough for ten cages. Please bring your new and old healthy birds, and we will await your arrival to seize the championship."</p>

<h3>延平路災民搭屋受阻請願</h3>
<h3>Disaster Victims on Yanping Road Petition After Being Prevented from Building Shelters</h3>
<p>[By our reporter] On the night of April 18th, a major fire broke out in the 31st Bao (neighborhood) of Yanping Road, affecting 1,863 households, mostly refugees from northern Jiangsu who had come to Shanghai. These disaster victims recently pooled their resources to build grass shelters on the site of the fire. However, the landlord, Renji Real Estate Company, intervened and, in conjunction with the police bureau, prohibited the construction. This led to clashes and bloodshed with the police, resulting in injuries on both sides. Yesterday afternoon, representatives were selected and marched to the Social Affairs Bureau to request that they ask the police bureau to allow the construction of shelters to resolve the housing problem. Section Chief Yuan and Section Chief Sun of the Ninth Section received them and stated that this matter was not under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau and could not be resolved. They advised the representatives to seek mediation from Wu Zhongda, the district head of the Jiangning District, and negotiate a proper resolution with the landlord. The petitioning disaster victims accepted the advice and left around 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>[By our reporter] Dai Shaonong, a 34-year-old accountant at Dafeng Longan Shop at No. 200 Zhonghua Road in the Nanshi district, was walking near the entrance of No. 87 Minguo Road yesterday around 10:00 AM when he was suddenly attacked by two men in short clothing.

Although severely injured, Dai attempted to chase after them, but after a few steps, he collapsed near the entrance of Dasheng Lane. Upon receiving the report, the Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau immediately dispatched officers to the scene. He was rushed to Renji Hospital, but died due to excessive blood loss.</p>
<h3>慘 淚洒特刑庭</h3>
<h3>Tragedy: Tears Shed in the Special Criminal Court</h3>
<p>Yunzhong Girls' School solemnly clarified that there was no student named Jin Ying among their students. The court also confirmed that her identity was incorrect. It turned out that Jin Ying had deceived her mother, pretending to study but actually roaming about. Yesterday, she was questioned in court and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Yangzi" You Lingling and "Gaoshiman" Feng Aina, one claiming to be sixteen and the other seventeen, were several years younger than their IDs indicated. Both said they reported younger ages so they could become dance hostesses. The judge asked whether You was a Rooster and Feng a Mandrill, and after calculating, said, "Unsuitable, unsuitable!"</p>
<p>According to regulations, a defendant can only be defended by three lawyers, but some had as many as seven. After discussion, it was said they were "largely the same," "on the same front," and the first three lawyers were selected in order.</p>
<p>Lawyer Yao successfully defended "Faraway" Yang Lili, arguing that her husband had died only a year ago, leaving behind a one-year-old girl, and she secretly went out to dance hostessing every night. This incident was a complete injustice. Yang covered her face with a handkerchief and sobbed.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhou Yizhi was granted permission to make a general defense together with Lawyer Chen Junrui. Zhou's demeanor was calm, and his words were meticulous. The defendants in custody were moved to tears three times, and the families in the audience also wept.</p>
<p>Chen Junrui said that banning dancing was "retrogressive, outdated, ignorant, and corrupt."</p>
<p>The defendants in custody rubbed medicated oil and took Bajiao pills. Hong Xiaoping felt particularly unwell and nearly fainted.</p>
<p>Female lawyers are rarely seen in court, but today there were Hua Xizhen and Zhang Hongwei. Hua was the most eloquent, with a forceful tone and a Wu dialect accent. To prove Tang Zongjie innocent, she demanded the interrogation of witnesses and argued with the court until she was red-faced.</p>
<p>Zhang Guangzong stood up to defend, holding a Parker 51 fountain pen to emphasize his gestures: "These ignorant defendants should be given reformatory education. Furthermore, they have been detained for four months, which is already too long." At the point of emotional intensity, the defendants in custody began to sob again.</p>
<p>Lou Yunmei said, "I know the presiding judge's character very well. If we follow the indictment, these poor souls could be sentenced to more than ten years in prison, and I'm afraid he couldn't bring himself to do it!" It was a plea to "spare their lives." Judge Wang waved his hand repeatedly, saying, "These words are unnecessary."</p>
<p>Judge Wang wrote down the phone number for a certain investigation, 74520, but mistakenly dipped his pencil in ink. Realizing the mistake, he quickly "corrected" it.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Wende, who argued that "dancing can cure frostbite," arrived late and also made an impassioned defense. After the arguments were completed, Master Zhu, the manager of "Saint Tarlac," raised his hand to speak, making a poignant statement: "Hu Yunyuan's brother died, but he doesn't know. My son also died a few days ago. The separation of flesh and blood is too tragic." After speaking, he wept bitterly, and all the defendants in custody knelt and cried, moving the surrounding audience to tears.</p>
<p>After leaving the courtroom, Hong Xiaoping and Wang Min held Lawyer Hua Xizhen's hand tightly, crying so hard they couldn't lift their heads. Many lawyers repeatedly urged the defendants in custody to be patient and not be sad.</p>
<p>The thirty-seven defendants have been detained for four months: brother dies, but [defendant] doesn't know, son dies, [defendant] father is in prison</p>

<h3>Feast for the Eyes: Wu Liangcai Introduces Two New Products</h3>
<p>[By our reporter] Wu Liangcai Optical Company has recently imported a complete set of automatic lens grinding machines from the United States, pioneering the use of machine-made lenses in China's eyewear industry. The advantage of this equipment is that it grinds lenses precisely, accurately, and quickly, compensating for the various shortcomings of manual grinding. In the future, the company will use these machines to grind all lenses ordered by customers. In addition, the company is introducing two of the latest American-style glasses: one is a rimless lens made of Plastio, which is fitted inside the eye socket when used to protect the eyes and correct the inaccuracy of ordinary lenses at high magnifications. The price is over 100 million yuan per pair. The other is "Hasan Sunglasses," which are made of brightly colored voile fabric attached to the frame for decoration by modern women, priced at 20 million yuan per pair.</p>

<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Our Maritime Rights; Navy Sends Warship to Seize One Vessel; Instructions on Handling the Situation Are Being Requested</h3>
<p>[By our reporter] Recently, Japanese fishing boats have frequently appeared in our territorial waters and fishing grounds, engaging in unauthorized fishing. The Shanghai Naval First Military District Headquarters received a telephone report from the Fuxing Island Fisheries Management Office on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, stating that four Japanese fishing boats were spotted near the Shaweitans outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, requesting that warships be dispatched to search and capture them. The First Military District Headquarters immediately dispatched the Zhongjian warship to conduct the search. At 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the four Japanese fishing boats were spotted in the northeast direction of Shaweitans, attempting to escape. The Zhongjian warship immediately ordered them to stop using signal lights. However, all four Japanese fishing boats were cunning and did not comply, instead accelerating and scattering in different directions. The Zhongjian warship also accelerated in pursuit, and after a chase of over ten nautical miles, finally captured one of them. The other three disappeared in the darkness. The captured fishing boat is named "Jingxian Maru" and has thirteen Japanese fishermen on board. They were escorted back to Shanghai by the Zhongjian warship last night.

<h3>兩個月期國庫券明日起正式上市 交割手續分為甲乙兩種</h3>
<h3>Two-Month Treasury Bills to be Officially Listed Starting Tomorrow; Settlement Procedures Divided into Two Types, A and B</h3>
<p>[By our reporter] The Central Bank authorities recently announced that they have decided to issue a new type of treasury bill with a term of two months. These treasury bills will be listed on the stock exchange tomorrow. The face value categorization of these bills is the same as that of the one-month treasury bills. The current issuance covers the period from the end of this month, i.e., from May 31st to July 31st. When listed on the stock exchange, they will be divided into two categories, A and B. Category A involves trading on the same day and settlement by noon the next day. Category B involves trading on the same day and settlement on the third day. The discount rate will be adjusted at any time based on market conditions.</p>
<p>The Short-Term Treasury Bill Discount Rate Committee originally established by the Central Bank has now been renamed the Open Market Committee due to the listing of treasury bills. Its regular work involves determining the discount rate for one-month treasury bills, the issuance policy for two-month treasury bills, and the general trading policy for treasury bills.</p>
<p>Also reported: Since the issuance of short-term treasury bills, 2.5 trillion yuan has been sold in Shanghai alone as of yesterday. Starting June 1st, it has been decided to expand sales to five other cities: Nanjing, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. The sales agencies in Shanghai will be the Central Bank, as well as other Central Bank branches and municipal banks starting June 1st. Sales in other cities will temporarily be handled solely by the Central Bank branches.</p>
<p>Also reported: Mr. Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, held a press conference at 6:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Wang Zishuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the bank, and Mr. Gu Shanchang, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, were also present.</p>

<h3>Rice Market Sees Small External Drop: 200,000 Yuan Lower Than Previous Day</h3>
<p>The rice market retreated as the tin market showed signs of short covering, leading to public weariness. No trading has yet occurred within the market, and external prices have dropped by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, transactions were not numerous. White yuan and shaded yuan were actively sold, and rice shops showed strong demand. Therefore, the market remains firmly stable. White yuan remains steady at 8 million, white粳 is priced at 6.8 million, thin稻 matches white粳 in price, early 稻 is at 6.6 million, and sheep秈 also falls to 6.7 million yuan. The People's Relief Commission continues to sell rice as usual, with arrivals decreasing again, totaling 1,934 stones across the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour declined due to the imminent arrival of new wheat. Prices in Suzhou and Wuxi have already fallen, causing merchants to feel uneasy and rush to sell. The morning market was the weakest. Old vehicle spot trading was at 2.05 million, but the central market stabilized as the price of flour sold by the Central Trust Bureau increased by 30,000 to 2.03 million delivered, marking the start of stability. Old vehicles ultimately closed at 2.09 million, while military vessels also rose after an initial dip, closing at 2.08 million, each showing a minor increase of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Red Bee, Jian Cheng, and other miscellaneous brands of flour all fell by 50,000. Bran declined by 100,000. Wheat mills had weak demand, opening at 2.9 million original issue.</p>
<p>Sales of miscellaneous grains turned sluggish. As the reported price of rice decreased, public sentiment waned, and the market declined. Soybean oil factories and merchant guilds reduced their purchases. Cargo owners felt unable to maintain support, and prices ultimately fell. Hankou summer soybeans closed at 3.3 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. Corn fell by 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum retreated by 150,000. Green beans also remained sluggish. New Qing beans were still offered at 2.95 million. New Yuan wheat weakened. Sesame remained flat and soft. Raw peanuts had thin inventories and stood firm at 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil declined. The drop in all grains led to a selling trend. Demand within the street also decreased, with retail investors selling but not buying. Bean oil initially declined sharply. The lowest price for Shun Yu bean oil opened at 14.2 million yuan. The market later rebounded, with Da You bean oil closing at 14.8 million yuan, ultimately reporting a slight drop of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Raw vegetable oil also decreased slightly by 200,000 to 300,000. Raw oil weakened slightly by 100,000 to 200,000. Clear oil and sesame oil consistently declined. Small vehicle sesame oil fell by 300,000. Bean cake initially declined by 30,000 to 40,000, but retail demand ultimately caused it to rise again, with only a slight decrease of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>External Trading of Rice Will Be Subject to Prohibition Measures</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day the government implemented the policy of selling 6,000 dan of rice daily. Whether the government will continue to sell rice next week and at what price will be decided by Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, responded to reporters' inquiries yesterday regarding the effectiveness of the rice selling and price limit policies over the past week. He stated: "The surge in rice prices has been suppressed, which is the greatest effect. However, general rice merchants indicate that the result of rice selling and price limits has created off-market trading and reduced the source of rice."</p>
<p>According to Chief Ji: "Although off-market prices are high, the government's allocated rice is abundant, so not many off-market transactions are completed. The authorities are paying close attention to this and will have new measures to prohibit it."</p>
<p>Regarding the reduction in source areas due to allocated rice, Ji stated that there is no problem because the current city rice supply is not lacking. The government supply exceeds demand, and it is not necessary to rely entirely on supply areas.</p>
<p>[Another report] The allocation price for household rice for the next month will be decided at a meeting tomorrow afternoon. It is reported that the mayor has discussed with the Americans and requested that the original price of 3.5 million for this month be maintained.</p>
<h3>Bearish Forces Apply Frequent Pressure: The State of Chinese Stocks Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally dampened public sentiment. Despite discussions of currency reform, there was a widespread feeling that multiples were too high. Bearish pressure was significant, and stocks struggled in a state of weakness for most of the time. Industry insiders and bank syndicates maintained support, and stability returned near noon.</p>
<p>The morning opened weakly. Yongsha declined to 2,730 yuan. After opening, more buying occurred due to bargain hunting, and it initially reached 2,755 yuan.

Later, No. 52 and others took advantage of the low price to buy, and the black market rose significantly. Many engaged in arbitrage, and it gradually rose to 2,695 yuan. Near noon, selling occurred down to 2,655 yuan, but Gu and bank syndicates maintained support, and No. 152 and others absorbed, pushing the noon close to 2,700 yuan. Compared to the previous close, underwear fell by 10%, Sino-French Jinglun, China Silk, and Commercial fell by 5%, Hua Xin Yong remained flat, and the rest all slightly declined.

<h3>Central Trust Bureau Publicly Auctions Japanese Bartered Woolens</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting on behalf of the government's barter trade with Japan, imported 310,000 yards of woolens last year. Originally intended to cooperate with the government's price stabilization policy to supply market needs, the Woolen Textile Industry Association suggested reselling the goods abroad. Therefore, the goods were temporarily stored in bonded warehouses without customs declaration while reporting to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to request handling methods.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan convened relevant agencies to thoroughly review the case and ordered the Central Trust Bureau to sell it on the domestic market. Now, the Central Trust Bureau has complied with the order and completed customs clearance. It is stipulated that the first public auction of fabrics such as pilice, valeting, and feather yarn will be held on June 2nd. Samples can be viewed and application procedures can be completed two days prior.</p>
<h3>Banks and Bureaus Revise Internal Exchange Rates</h3>

<h3>Public Sentiment Is Weak and Discouraged: The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market Is Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market appeared mixed. Replicating manufacturers still absorbed 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn. The opening price immediately jumped by 3 million yuan. Subsequently, as the interest of both local and nonlocal merchant groups waned, it ultimately closed at 316 million yuan, still a slight increase of 1 million yuan from the previous day. The attitudes of various parties towards brands such as Shui Yue Jin Cheng and 40-count yarn varied, and the market price fluctuated.</p>
<p>21-count Shuang Ma yarn also initially rose by 2 million yuan. Later, due to the inverted pricing in nonlocal markets and the impact of the inability to use same-day checks from June 1, public sentiment weakened. Counter groups and retailers sold, resulting in a decline of 7 million yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining 20-count, 16-count, and 32-count yarns, etc., all declined by varying amounts, from 1 million to 2 million to 6 million to 7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw continued arrivals of northbound floating capital. Merchants from Xuzhou and Bengbu continued to buy strongly, dye factories also absorbed slightly, and companies traded back and forth. The market trend hovered firmly.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped up 50,000 upon opening. Money was loose on the market. Rumors spread of currency reform, and retail investors vigorously pushed up prices, driving the price even higher to 7.16 million yuan. Subsequently, there was mutual selling to lock in profits, and due to restrictions on the use of bank same-day checks from June 1, public sentiment waned, and everyone adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, Dragon Head fine cloth ultimately retreated to 7.09 million, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan from the previous day. Brands such as Wu Fu, Blue Chicken, and Cai Qiu also continued to rise by 10,000 to 30,000 or 40,000 yuan. In addition, fine twill, coarse cloth, khaki, etc., sold well, rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Shilin cloth also remained relatively popular.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Silk: Production Gradually Increases</h3>

<h3>Siam Reduces Overseas Chinese Schools on the Pretext of Violating the Principles of UN Education</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 28th] The Siamese Ministry of Education summoned over 200 people, including overseas Chinese school directors and principals, yesterday morning and formally warned them at the meeting, saying: Overseas Chinese schools have no special privileges and must comply with the rules on private schools like other schools. According to the Siamese side, the former Luan Tanrong government granted some special privileges to overseas Chinese schools based on the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty. Today's warning is similar to the previous one. A spokesperson for the Siamese Ministry of Education also said: The Siamese government intends to restrict the number of schools for overseas Chinese in Bangkok and other provinces because the number is "too many." However, how the ministry will solve the education problem of thousands of overseas Chinese children after the schools are closed, he has not said anything about. Neutral people here said: The schools run by overseas Chinese can reduce a large number of illiterates for Siam. Therefore, in the campaign to eradicate illiteracy, it is still a task of the UN Educational Organization. Siam's closure of a large number of established educational institutions is indeed not advisable.</p>

<h3>Yingtang and Jinhua Middle School Students Clash While Watching a Play: Fighting All Night: More Than 50 Yingtang University Students Injured</h3>
<p>[Our report, Jinhua, 29th] Last night, students from Yingtang University and Jinhua Middle School clashed while watching a play, fighting all night. More than 30 Yingtang University students were injured. This morning, the Jinhua security authorities sent troops to suppress it.

<h3>Fudan University Henan Students Seeking Justice for Deceased Classmate Wang Huiwan: Accuse Zhongshan Hospital of Neglect of Duty and Disregarding Human Life</h3>
<p>[Our report] Wang Huiwan, a first-year student in the Statistics Department of Fudan University, died in Zhongshan Hospital on the 24th of this month. The Henan Students Association of the school recently accused the hospital of "neglect of duty and disregard for human life" and issued an indictment to all sectors. It is said that Wang was 23 years old, from Neixiang, Henan, with excellent academic performance and a strong physique. In the early spring, he occasionally had a cough. After being diagnosed and treated by the school doctor, he said it was a cold, and taking aspirin was ineffective. He was admitted to the Army Hospital for treatment on May 5, and then transferred to Zhongshan Hospital, and his condition improved slightly. However, on the 13th of this month, Gong Sheng suddenly sent a letter from the hospital saying that the hospital refused to continue giving medicine because the medical expenses paid had been exhausted. On the 15th and 17th, he sent letters one after another, stating the same as before, and said that the illness had deteriorated due to the interruption of medicine. By the morning of the 24th, the school received a telegram from the hospital saying that Wang Sheng had passed away. The indictment stated at the end: The hospital is obligated to diagnose and treat patients. Even if Wang's treatment was due to overdue medical expenses, as the hospital said, how could it sit back and watch without saving him and let him die? It is obviously unreasonable and seems to be a crime of intentional homicide. After investigation, Wang Sheng had prepaid 10 million yuan in medical expenses in accordance with regulations when he was first admitted to the hospital (with receipts), and had been approved by the Student Relief Association to bear Wang Sheng's medical expenses, but the hospital claimed that it only received 5 million yuan until it finally confirmed the full amount of payment (the remaining amount of more than 3 million yuan was refunded during the settlement). From this, it can be proved that Wang Sheng's death was indeed due to the hospital's negligence, which led to the interruption of medicine and a grievance. The association is scheduled to hold a memorial service at the school at 8 am today, and then invite reporters to report and prepare to file a lawsuit to seek justice for the deceased.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Football Semifinals: Qingbai Eliminates Railway, 1-0 in Penalty Kicks</h3>
<p>In the Mayor's Cup football semifinals, Qingbai defeated Railway 1-0 yesterday to win the right to the final, which will be scheduled to compete with Donghua for the championship. Qingbai and Railway were evenly matched, and the fierce battle was unprecedented. Neither team was able to score. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Railway's Yue Renxiao was penalized with a penalty kick, which Qingbai used to secure the victory. Due to the importance of yesterday's game and the tense situation, there were inevitable fouls. The audience numbered three to four thousand, and Yiyuan was quite lively. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Lu Shunde.</p>
<p>Railway Misses Opportunity</p>
<p>The game started at 4:00 PM, with Qingbai taking advantage of the favorable wind and kicking off first, with high morale. However, the absence of Ao Qixiang and the late arrival of Fei Chunhua inevitably affected their strength. After six minutes, Jiang Qing committed a foul, and Wu Binghao took a free kick. Qin Bigao saved the ball but dropped it. Lin Dianyi rushed up like a shot and kicked it, hitting Qin Bigao and bouncing out. It was a great pity that Railway missed this opportunity, otherwise, the situation might have changed. After fifteen minutes, Xiao Luo got the ball and shot hard from 20 yards out, but Liao Xiong turned it into a corner kick. Soon after, Xiao Gao darted to the right wing and crossed the ball, but Xiao Luo kicked it wide.</p>
<p>Qingbai's Fierce Attack</p>
<p>At this time, Qingbai launched a fierce attack in Railway's penalty area. However, they lacked luck and failed to score. Xiao Gu dribbled through the middle and passed to Xiao Gao, who kicked it wide. Again, Afu passed to Jin Lusheng, who dribbled and shot wide. After 26 minutes, Jin and Luo rode side by side and passed the ball into the middle. Xiao Gao raised his foot to shoot, but it was blocked by the dense formation. Xiao Gu penetrated again and lobbed the ball in front of the goal, but Liao Xiong jumped out and caught it. Then, Xiao Luo passed to Jin Lusheng, who cut in along the sideline, but Liao rushed out and turned it into a corner kick.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>After 38 minutes, Yue Renxiao fouled Xiao Gao in the penalty area, committing a serious foul. Xiao Luo took the penalty kick and scored low, establishing the victory. Railway lost this goal and never recovered. Railway lost ground again, and Jiang Qing kissed the ball with his hand outside the penalty area. Xiao Ziwen took the shot, and the landing point was excellent, but Lu Qingxiang headed it just outside the goal. The first half ended.</p>
<p>Strange Whistles Sound</p>
<p>After changing sides, Qingbai replaced Yin Qingbing with Fei Chunhua and Liu Tiyin, while Railway replaced Xu Shengyuan and Wu Binghao with Fei Chunlin and Qu Xigen. The two armies fought again. After five minutes, Yue Renxiao kicked Jiang Qing and was sent off by Zhang Le. Railway had to fight with ten men. In an instant, Xiao Fei penetrated along the sideline and hooked the ball to the center. Afu headed it wide. At this time, countless silver whistles were heard on the sidelines, disrupting the order of the game. The game was suspended for a moment. After the game was restarted, Xiao Luo and Lusheng failed to score twice, and the whistles sounded again on the sidelines, echoing each other. Zhang Le could not bear it any longer and decided not to officiate anymore. He was replaced by Lu Shunde, and the vacant position of linesman was taken over by Wang Chongye. After 19 minutes, Xiao Luo hooked the ball, Xiao Fei caught it and passed it again, but Liu Tiyin hesitated slightly, and it all vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Railway Counterattacks</p>
<p>Railway was eager to reverse the situation and committed numerous fouls. After 29 minutes, Wu Jiabang committed a handball, and Afu took a free kick. The ball shot out like an arrow, heading straight for the net, but Liao Xiong deflected it into a corner kick. After 34 minutes, Xiao Gao intercepted the ball, dribbled a few times, and suddenly shot from 15 yards out, but Liao Xiong慌 rushed to save it. A minute later, Xiao Fei cut in and shot at the goal, but the ball hit the post and bounced out. Xiao Gao caught up and shot again, but it went high and out. After that, Xiao Fei cut in and kicked it out of bounds, Jin Lusheng passed it beautifully, Xiao Luo hooked the ball, but Xiao Gao missed. As time ran out, Railway lost by one goal and returned in regret.</p>

<h3>Longdong—The Huge Millstone</h3>
<p>Since this spring, the wind and rain in the northwest have been dark and ominous. The entire military situation has gone from tight to relaxed, from northern Shaanxi to western Guanzhong, and then to eastern Longdong. This huge millstone has caused infinite changes in the existence and comparison of strength in the northwest.</p>
<p>Initially, the Communist bandits believed that they had completed a major "victory" in the Yichuan Campaign. This fluke "victory" misled the Communist bandits' minds and was taken as proof that they would inevitably win. As a result, their style changed drastically, from being secretive to being bold. They no longer used mobile warfare, but boldly attempted to use their main force to attack the main force of the National Army, in order to control Guanzhong, isolate Xi'an, and threaten the Northwest.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits' boldness was finally shattered! With the close cooperation of the Guanzhong Corps and the Longdong Corps, and with the unified attack of the National Army's land and air forces, the Communist bandits suffered huge and heavy blows. First, they were defeated and fled to Lingshan, and then they were defeated in Yongshou. Their morale was almost completely lost. When the National Army's Ma Jiyuan Division attacked Tunzi Town, all the Communist bandits fled and dared not take any action. In their haste, they left behind all their heavy weapons. The National Army created a brilliant record here.</p>
<p>In total, the results of the National Army's victory in this campaign were as follows: The Communist bandits suffered 27,800 casualties, and more than 6,500 people were captured. The headquarters of the Communist bandits' First, Fourth, and Sixth Columns, and seven brigade headquarters, were all smashed. Rifles, machine guns, and radio stations were also captured in large numbers.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Students Save Money to Help Refugee Children</h3>
<p>Letter from the children of the Central National School in Situan Town, Fengxian</p>
<p>To the Editor: We saw the May 11th crystal with a group of second-grade class A children from the Municipal Nancang National School appealing for refugee children and donating money to create a start. It really makes us 120,000 points of admiration! The teacher told us about this and posted the newspaper in the classroom, asking us what our feelings were. We were deeply moved! Therefore, we unhesitatingly launched a Save-to-Aid-Refugee-Children campaign, from Friday of this week to Monday of this week. The entire class of students donated 580,000 yuan, which the teacher topped off to 600,000 yuan. The teacher also paid the postage. Although the amount is very small, we are sending this small number, which is pitiful, out of sympathy for our refugee friends and in response to Nancang School's righteous act of saving to help refugees!</p>
<p>We are praying for our refugee friends, hoping that everyone will unite and respond, and universally launch this Save-to-Aid movement. Then, the so-called accumulation of sand into a tower, the gathering of armpits into fur, this broad collective power will surely be considerable. We hope that you can forward the donation on our behalf. How grateful we are to you, sir!</p>
<p>Sincerely, all the elementary students in the fifth and sixth grades of the Central National School in Situan Town, Fengxian County</p>

<h3>Culture and Politics</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>On the 29th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement this year, Mr. Hu Shi said the following to reporters: "The May Fourth Movement was a new thought, new culture movement, not a political movement at the time. At that time, we felt that if we wanted to promote new culture and new ideas, we had to establish a new foundation on a non-political basis, so our proposition at that time was not to engage in politics for twenty years... We tried our best to avoid politics at that time, but politics not only could not leave us, but on the contrary, it came to force us, so that the May Fourth Movement slowly became a political movement... Later, the political nature became extraordinarily strengthened, which may be good, may be bad, I don't want to comment, but the meaning of culture has slowly weakened. I personally feel that this politicized movement was too early, because the strength was really not enough. For the past twenty-nine years, I personally have always felt that the foundation of politics should be built on the foundation of culture and ideas, and efforts should be made from the cultural aspect..."</p>
<p>Regarding this speech, under the current situation, people's reactions are probably still not consistent. My personal reaction to this speech, in short, is—</p>
<p>The biggest problem in China today lies in the chaotic mess, which makes people feel that "there is no way to start." The formation of this phenomenon is due to the lack of attention to efficiency in handling affairs; and the development of the habit of not paying attention to efficiency is due to the lack of a scientific spirit to formulate plans in advance, even if there are plans, and even if the plans are in line with scientific principles, but afterwards they are unwilling to do it in an orderly manner; this is because the people who handle affairs are not adequately educated, and this is also due to the lack of a new cultural foundation. A Westerner once said that there are many disputes in our country that, if they were in the United States, could be resolved in less than a month, but in China they would become a prairie fire, which would be unmanageable. This is because the United States already has that kind of cultural foundation, while China does not.</p>
<p>The biggest issues facing the country at present are naturally suppressing the rebellion and the economy. However, today, some people not only do not have the determination to solve these two problems, but also use these two problems as a shield to pursue their own selfish interests; even more people are using them as a shield for the "doing-nothing politics" of sitting and waiting for death. "During the suppression period, we have no choice but to do this." "Under the current economic situation, what else can we do!" We can hear such arguments everywhere. They are pushing all the responsibility onto these two major problems. This reminds us of the old tune of "in times of emergency" and "everything should be simplified" or "everything should be postponed" before the war. We might as well ask: Do we really and sincerely use the scientific spirit to do things practically? If we carry out things in an orderly manner according to a scientific plan, even under the shroud of these two major problems, the situation would not be so bad. To be honest, the reason why these two problems are so serious today is still due to the habit of "pulling the wool over people's eyes."</p>
<p>So, today, the word "politics" has become synonymous with "mess."</p>
<p>Moreover, this kind of political atmosphere has even spread to some groups that call themselves "culture" and "education." It has always been thought that in order to seek the rule of the country, it is most important to cultivate a good social atmosphere. "If the superiors have a preference, the inferiors will have it in excess." This means that the atmosphere must be cultivated from top to bottom. However, in democratic countries, it is the people who have a preference, and the superiors have no choice but to follow it, which is from bottom to top. From bottom to top, it is itself a good atmosphere. However, the situation in our country is not the same. Instead, the bad political atmosphere is spreading downwards, and the good atmosphere that those groups calling themselves "culture" and "education" should have has not extended upwards. In other words, China's culture is built on the foundation of politics, forming an upside-down pyramid.</p>
<p>This is still because our new cultural foundation is not solid enough and not broad enough. So, Mr. Hu said: "If we want to promote new culture and new ideas, we must establish a new foundation on a non-political basis... The foundation of politics should be built on the foundation of culture and ideas."</p>
<p>Obviously, this new cultural foundation cannot be rushed to completion with brute force. But we cannot use this as an excuse to return to the old path of waiting for death with our hands tied. Today, with the implementation of the constitution, the government has appointed Mr. Weng Wenhao, a scholar and intellectual, to preside over state affairs. We hope that this is the beginning of building a new cultural foundation.</p>
<h3>Sunday's Troubles</h3>
<p>— Chen Ye</p>
<p>On Sunday, Miss Zhang, Mr. Wang, and Mrs. Li were waiting for the tram at the North Sichuan Road terminus.</p>
<p>There were many people at the terminus, half of them soldiers and the other half young women and men. The women were all showing their arms and wearing various kinds of white leather shoes. It was a Sunday with beautiful sunshine.</p>
<p>A tram arrived, exactly the one that Miss Zhang and her companions wanted to take. However, because there were so many people, everyone swarmed on board, and it was immediately packed. Then came a No. 11 tram, which also took some people.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang and her friends wanted to go to a certain theater to see a film called something-or-other. Mrs. Li also had a child with her. Therefore, they wanted to wait for a relatively empty tram. After the No. 11 tram left, the number of people at the terminus had thinned out a bit, but after about five minutes without a tram arriving, the number of people waiting for the tram increased again. Seeing that the situation was not good, they tried to hail rickshaws. "×× Theater!" "Eighteen thousand!" the rickshaw puller said, making a gesture.</p>
<p>The tram did not come for a long time. Mr. Wang also hailed a rickshaw. The rickshaw puller wanted him to pay twenty thousand. Mr. Wang hesitated for a moment and replied, "Ten thousand!" The rickshaw puller got on the rickshaw and said as he walked, "Eighteen thousand is the least." He seemed completely indifferent and dismissive, and Mr. Wang was simply a little angry.</p>
<p>A tram arrived, and the child started to cry. Mrs. Li was unhappy and wanted to give up the idea of seeing the film. After a slight hesitation, the tram was already packed. Mr. Wang shouted, "Rickshaw! Rickshaw!" A rickshaw passed by and, hearing that they were going to the × theater, said it was too far and left without looking back. Mr. Wang's mood for going to the theater was gone, and the troubles accumulated in life all surged into his heart. He just urged everyone to go home.</p>
<p>Not being able to get on the tram and not being able to see the film, how do you know it's not a blessing? Or even if you get to the cinema, you might not be able to buy tickets. Or the film might not be as good as expected. Although the plot of the film can push away the troubles of reality, you will soon have to return to the worries of life, to the cage of reality. Unluckily, it starts to rain when you come back, and the rickshaw pullers' "gouging" is even more terrible. The people selling evening newspapers hand the newspaper to you: "Prices have risen again." The already unpleasant mood is deepened by another layer...</p>
<h3>On Eating in the Old Capital (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Guang He Ju's Pan Fish and Jiang Tofu</p>
<p>Guang He Ju is located in the northern half of Jiejie Hutong, outside Xuanwumen. Since the Ming Dynasty, the southern city has been the place where scholar-officials resided. Banquets with literature and wine often took place in Guang He Ju. Therefore, the store has many couplets and poems written by famous people since the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. The most adorable are the handwritten menus of famous people. When I was in the Compilation and Translation Office of the Ministry of Education, I had seen them several times. The store's most famous dishes are Pan Fish and Jiang Tofu. Pan Fish is braised fish with a slightly sour and spicy taste. Jiang Tofu is made by mixing fermented soybeans, ginger rice, and other ingredients in tofu. Its deliciousness is unforgettable to this day. The names "Pan" and "Jiang" refer to the people who invented these dishes. Pan was Pan Bingnian from Fujian (a Jinshi of the Xinwei year, later the governor of Kuizhou Prefecture), the father-in-law of my friend Lin Ziyou. People mistakenly call him Pan Zuyin. Jiang was from Yiyang, Jiangxi, and an official in charge of affairs (Jiang Kanghu's father). Fermented soybeans are a local specialty. In the late Qing Dynasty, two poems题壁 widely circulated from Guang He Ju are recorded below, which are also an anecdote of the store.</p>
<p>Two generations in one family as Dry Fathers, joy upon joy comes from one house. According to custom, they should be called Gege (Manchu language, like Miss in Chinese). Please rest assured that they will not let down their fathers, opening a new style in the Prince Qi's residence. When Jiang Ling returns, there is an old yamen. The son plays with jade, and the father plays with tiles, dodder juxtaposed with dodder flower.</p>
<p>Publicly, a family of Manchus and Han Chinese, dry daughters and dry sons are all new. They should also engage in Zhu and Chen marriages, originally Yunnan and Guizhou are relatives. Oriole voices chirp as they call Father, piglets fondly cling to Mother in the morning. Who can recognize the unique charm, why do you all bother asking about the past?</p>
<p>This poem was written because Imperial Censor Jiang Chunlin accused in his memorial that Zhili Governor-General Chen KuiLong was Prince Qing Yikuang's dry son-in-law, and Anhui Governor Zhu Jiabao was Yikuang's son Beizi Zaizhen's dry son, etc. Later, it was found that there was no evidence, and Jiang Chunlin was ordered to return to his original yamen. The phrase Yunnan and Guizhou is because Zhu was from Yunnan and Chen was from Guizhou. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Guang He Ju closed down due to poor business, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Hui Xian Tang's Shandong Cuisine</p>
<p>Hui Xian Tang is located at Shicha Sea outside the back door. The area is open with many trees. When lotus flowers bloom in the summer, tea sheds are lined up selling tea or watermelon and iced water, which is a popular summer resort for people in the capital. Li Xiya, the Prime Minister of the Ming Dynasty from Dongyang, lived here, and Qing scholar Shi Shan, whose literary name was Wumen, also lived here. When I was studying in the old capital, Zhang Zhidong lived in Baimi Xiejie, which was next to Shicha Sea. Scholar-officials who visited Zhidong often ate at Hui Xian Tang Restaurant. The dishes in the restaurant were no more than ordinary Shandong cuisine, but looking at the railing, there were tens of thousands of tall willows and a pool of accumulated water, making the scenery excellent. Because the famous painter Pu Xinyu's residence was very close to Shicha Sea, he would always treat his guests at Hui Xian Tang. In a certain year before 7/7, I visited my brother in the old capital. Xinyu treated me here. Those at the table were Chen Sanli, Yuan Bokui Siliang, Fu Zhixiang Yuefen, Chen Bingshu Zuren, Shen Gengmei Zhaoxin, my brother Cangqiu, and my younger brother Xunxian. After drinking, we went to Xinyu's residence (Prince Gong's Mansion) to talk about art and dispersed at midnight. The scenery is still vivid in my mind, Xinyu's garden has changed owners (now the dormitory of Fu Jen Catholic University), and I don't know if Hui Xian Tang still exists.</p>
<p>Wen's Lamian Noodles</p>
<p>There is a Fuquan Restaurant on Longfu Temple Street in the old capital. The dishes are very famous. In the past, the owner would eat at Fuquan Restaurant, while the servants and rickshaw pullers would eat at Zao Wen, because the two restaurants were very close to each other. This restaurant is famous for its Lamian noodles, also known as Cheng noodles. Duan Laosi (Duanfang's nickname, the old women in the Hutongs of the old capital passed down the saying that there was "big Rong, small Na, Duan Laosi." Rong was Rong Quan, a secretary of the Imperial Household Department, Na was Natong, who later became a Grand Councilor, and Duan rose to the position of Governor-General of Zhili.) After being dismissed from his official post, he once went to eat alone, and it became a place for scholar-officials to eat noodles. Other famous noodle shops in the old capital include "Erduoyan" on Qianmenwai Street and "Yitiaolong" in Guanyin Temple outside Qianmen. These two shops are famous for their small size.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Lightning</h3>
<p>— Tong Tuo</p>
<p>Once, it is said that a ball of fire rolled into a woman's bedroom, gradually rolling over and approaching the bed. It scorched the woman's hair and upper garment. The ball of fire finally hit the foot of the bed, exploded, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Another time, a mysterious force suddenly pulled a key out of the door lock and threw it precisely into a shoe on the floor.</p>
<p>A bell ringer in an English church was about to ring the bell when a strong halo suddenly appeared in the bell tower, preventing him from ringing the bell. The halo exploded in front of the altar, leaving behind a general sulfurous odor.</p>
<p>The above and so on, sound mysterious, but in fact, they are the pranks of lightning, a natural phenomenon with which we are most familiar. Although scientists are racking their brains to study the properties of lightning, there is still no way to fully understand the diverse tricks of lightning.</p>
<p>In countless instances, lightning has stripped people of their clothes, making them naked, but without harming the human body. Once, lightning melted an iron chain into an iron bar. Another time, lightning struck and killed a hunter, but the shotgun on his body did not go off.</p>
<p>The strangest recorded lightning prank is as follows. A person was struck by lightning and had two abbreviated letters, DD, burned onto his leg. The doctor who treated him suddenly remembered that he had a tortoiseshell money clip stolen a few days earlier, which also had those two abbreviated letters on it. Later, that person confessed that he was a petty thief, and the money clip was hidden on his body when the lightning struck.</p>
<p>Looking at the interesting dramas performed by lightning over the past century, it is like watching the life experience of a top magician. Lightning faded the gilding on two picture frames, but did not damage the frames or the paintings. Two women were knitting wool, when a lightning bolt suddenly caused the knitting needles to fly far away, but the two women were not injured. A pocket watch that had not been working for a long time suddenly started ticking again after being struck by lightning.</p>
<p>On the same day: one lightning bolt knocked a mirror hanging on the wall to the ground, but the mirror did not break; but another lightning bolt caused a nearby house to collapse. At a grand costume ball, lightning struck down a chimney, and the soot blackened the dancing men and women.</p>
<p>Legends about "ball" lightning are even more bizarre, and it has the habit of rolling into houses. Once, a ball of fire pushed open the door of a house outside the city. In another incident, a farmer's daughter saw a ball of fire rolling to her father's livestock pen. She went to play with it, and the ball of fire exploded, killing all the livestock in the pen, leaving the girl unharmed.</p>
<p>Lightning can not only kill humans, but conversely, it can also cure diseases. A deaf person regained his hearing after being struck by lightning, and a blind worker regained his sight after being struck by lightning. In another incident, lightning made paralyzed limbs move again. Madmen have been cured by being struck by lightning, which is almost the same as the modern electric therapy method for psychological disorders.</p>
<p>In the city of Jielanting in Peru, a beautiful girl was walking when she was suddenly struck by lightning. Although she was not harmed, she became mute.</p>
<h3>Lodging in Yuqian</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Longing for mountain life after residing in the city, serving guests chicken-pecked cloud and mist tea; the sound of gurgling streams in rocky valleys all day long, crows circling around trees in the setting sun.</p>
<p>Inscribed on a Painting of Cloud Sea, Presented to Abbot Wuzong</p>
<p>Famous mountains and ancient temples connect with vast clouds, not the mundane world but resembling immortals; the record of mist and clouds fulfills a long-held wish, Buddhism originally says it is fate.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Looking back at the Three Powers era of the Jin Dynasty, although it was said to be a three-legged stand, the judiciary was one of the state councilors, and judicial administration was a branch of state administration, no longer the balanced "incense burner legs." The Supreme Court was the highest judicial organ, so the President was specially appointed and parallel to the Ministry of Justice, while the Procuratorate General, which was established alongside the Supreme Court, was under the Ministry of Justice. The Minister of Justice and the President of the Supreme Court were highly respected and specially appointed, but they were only high-ranking officials appointed and could not "consult" with the President like the two houses of parliament, which was structurally unbalanced. However, the independence of the judiciary and the authority of the judiciary were not entirely dependent on the system, and if the President, as the head of state, was bound by the meaning of "three powers in balance" and used "consultation" frequently, it would also be inappropriate. Therefore, in my personal feeling at that time, it was not unacceptable for the "rule" of "judiciary" in the administrative system (because "rule" does not necessarily mean "subordination"), but I had doubts about the two houses of parliament, which were said to be legislative organs, surpassing equilibrium and reaching the level of the head of state. I once had a private conversation with a certain secretary-general of the House of Representatives about this. The secretary-general said that the two houses of parliament could only use "consultation" with the head of state, unless it was a monarchy where they could use "presenting" like administrative officials. I said that the State Council was parallel to the two houses of parliament, which was enough to show the status of "legislation" and "administration" being equally respected. You insist on the "President being the head of the administration," but when there are major state affairs inquiries, why do you only ask the Premier to attend and answer, and not the President? It can be seen that the explanation that the President cannot specialize in "administration" alone is known. If it is said that the use of consultation by the speakers of the two houses of parliament is to show the dignity of "parallelism," then why is there a specially designed, towering, high-backed armchair for the President north of the speaker's seat in the assembly hall? Why not move this chair to a parallel position with the speaker and use a chair of the same size and length as the speaker's chair? At this point, the secretary-general smiled and could not answer, turning to ask for my opinion.</p>
<p>I said that after talking for so long, it is still a matter of official document format. Since the two houses of parliament are different from administrative officials and do not want to receive "orders" or use "presenting," they must know that there is an appropriate method in the document format that is between "superior" and "inferior." In the past, purely parallel relations, such as the officials in the various ministries and courts of Beijing and the governors-general and governors of the outer provinces, used "consultation" with each other without any problem. However, in institutions led by princes and grand scholars, such as the "Grand Council" and the "Office of Foreign Affairs," the ministries and provinces had to use "consulting-presenting" to them, which was a "semi-parallel style," indicating that although they were not subordinates in terms of authority, there was still a distinction of rank in the system, which was both reasonable and sensible. The President's documents can use consultation or note verbale, like the governors-general and governors treating local gentry, each doing their duty, which would be appropriate. The secretary-general said that the Republic of China does not have the format of "consulting-presenting." I said, "Isn't 'Consultation Document' an old format?" However, we are talking about this in private. You do not have the power to revise the format, and I am not submitting a memorial either. So we laughed and talked about other things.</p>
