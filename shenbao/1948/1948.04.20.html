<h3>國大提案　今繼續審查</h3>
<p>十四次大會休會</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕國大七組審委會定廿日晨九時起分別開會，審查提案。現提案之待審查者，尙有將近七百件，故上下午均將開會。第十四次大會原定十九日下午三時舉行，唯以屆時人數不足，主席馮有眞兩度宣布延長時間，亦未能開會，至下午四時許始宣布休會。十四次會議日一程中，僅列答覆事項，為政府對一於各項檢討之答覆，事實上各部一門之答覆均已印就書面文件散發，故政府答復將不再佔用大會時間。</p>
<h3>國大今晨公告　副總統候選人　簽署提名書查核完竣</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕中華民國第一任副總統候選人提名，國民大會定二十日晨依法公吿，其名單共列孫科，于石任，李宗仁，程潛，草德惠，徐傳霖等六人。其公吿文為：「茲依照總統·副總統選舉罷免法第五條，準用同法第四條第一項第一款之規定，開列副總統候選人名單，並依同條第一項第二款之規定，以連署提出之代表人數多寡為先後公吿之·國大主席團十九日晚八時開會後，推完顧毓琇，劉士毅，社聿明，蘇挺等十餘人檢核簽署提名書，至廿晨二時止始將各候選人簽署提名書檢核元竣，以連署提名孫科為副總統候選人者為最多，計五百餘票，次于右任，五百餘票，李宗仁四百餘票，程潛三百餘票，莫德惠二百餘票，徐傅霖一百餘票，其中連署重複剔除者共八八四票，均予作廢，計孫科廢二五零票，于右任二三六票，李宗仁一九三票，程潛一三二票，募　憲五十五票，徐傳霖十八票。</p>
<h3>解決選舉糾紛辦法　待完成立法程序　簽署代表獲得證書後須寫退讓書</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕國府十九日下午五時舉行「解決選舉糾紛談話會」，由吳鼎昌主持，討論于斌·王雲五等六人所擬之解決簽署國代糾紛之六項辦法，到王寵惠·吳鐵城·陳立夫等廿餘人，交換意見歷三小時之久。關於解決簽署代表問題，已決定數項具體辦法，惟尙須經國務會議通過及完成立法程序始可施行，其重要者為：（一）簽署代表得票多者可發給當選證書，惟於接獲當選證書後，應同時寫一退議書，讓予提名之友黨候選人；（二）簽署代表領得當進證書並退讓後，如願列席國大，國府文官處可咨請大會准予列席；（三）職業團體及婦女團體代表名額，在憲法上無明文規定，係以法律定之，為使此後簽署代表及落選之中央提名代表均可獲出席機會起見，將增加婦女及職業代表名額三百名，俟經國務會議通過及完成立法程序後將另定日期再行選舉，此次簽一署提名當選代表中之為國民黨員者，即為國民黨提名之　選人，參加競選，國民黨應予以支持；（四）另行選舉之日期，在增加名額完成立法秩序後四個月至六個月以內；（五）中央提名代表得票多而讓予友黨老亦可適用第一項辦法，由政府發給當選證書；（六）中央提名落選之代表，　於增加名額完成立法程序另行補選時，亦應由中央提名參加精選。上述辦法，可望於本週國務會時提出討論，于斌巳將其辦法內容請馬文車於深晚轉達各簽署代表，簽署代表均認為此項辦法之實行，尙須若干時日，現雖可先發給當選證書，但仍須寫退議書，尙非理想之　決辦法。</p>
<h3>孫科聲明放棄　立委當選資格</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕據確息：孫院長科頃函中央黨部，聲明放棄立法委員之當選資格。按孫氏係政黨提名，由廣州市所選出者。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕絕食代表顏澤滋·楊翹新·周游等七人，已於十九日下午四時半自第五招待所移住中央醫院。</p>
<p>〔又電〕簽署當選國代此次因深感於于斌，莫德惠諸代表之奔走，女醫師華淑君代表逐日前往注射葡葡糖針之辛勤及苦口勤導，願進醫院調養，聞其中周游代表因被華醫師之善爲勸導而感動下淚，華代表爲自由織業團體所選出之代表，故最近有國大「自由神」之雅號。</p>

<p>總統蔣公，名中正，字介石，浙江奉化縣溪中鎭人，生於民國紀元前廿五年十月卅一日，現年六十二歲，先世耕讀不仕，祖父王表公，你肅庵公，皆著令德，母王太夫人，端淑有遠識，總統八九時歲連遭祖父與父喪門祚　落，　承庭訓師　，王太夫人躬爲課讀，督教極　，而愛護備至，期以遠大。總統十七歲入奉化鳳麓學堂，次年從鄞縣顧淸廉先生學，以其器宇軼羣，備承獎勉，受周秦諸子及曾文正集，並習讀孫除，勉學萬人敵，其後總統嘗自謂於吾國學術淵源，得涉其涯涘，及通曉讀書法，皆出顧先生之敎。</p>
<p>總統一生之學問功業，與其忠孝仁愛信義和平之德性，實立基於其良好之家庭教育與幼年教育。十九歲就學邑空之龍津中學，時値淸日戰役，總統痛國事日非，內外煎迫，救國救民之志與年俱深，矢志出國習陸軍，乃東渡日本，以非本國陸軍部保送，改入淸華學校，是年在東京識陳英士先生，廣交革命志士，爲立志獻身於革命事業之始，冬返國，次年考入保定陸軍軍官學堂，膺選留日陸軍學生，遂再赴日本，時民國紀元前五年，主席年一歲，入東京振武學校，由陳英士先生之介紹，加入同盟會，益聯絡同志為革命效力，越二年畢業，入日本高田野砲兵第十三聯隊，為士官生，營中生活，極端嚴格，朝操，刷馬，晚歸括靴，刻苦勞作，鍛練體肌，自認生平學問實業，頗多得力於此。又二年，值辛亥革命之時機益成熱，是夏總統由日歸國，與陳英士先生在滬密謀規劃，舉義江浙，至八月再回聯隊，未及一月，得武昌起華之報，乃微服走長崎，登輪回國，主持浙事，赴杭運動新軍，募集敢死隊赴義，九月十三日上海宣告獨立，次夜二時，杭城　應，敢死隊首先發難，燬撫署，虜淸吏，浙省旣下，又返滬，助英士先生謀定全蘇，親練步兵一團，任團長，是為滬軍第五國。民國初年，詩世凱擅權毀法，摧殘革命，總統在上海追隨國父，襄助英士先生，奔走革命，躬與四年討袁之役。肇和砲艦起義之事，尤足張革命之勢，喪軍閥之膽。民國六年，國父南下護法　，總統居滬，盱衡國事，夙主北伐，數上書國父，陳治平之策。此後四年，凡所擘劃，洞澈機徵，翊贊戎機，每多藝策。十年五月，國父就大總統職，總統為定安桂方略，六月王太夫人棄養，總統哀毀逾恒，居喪在里，嘗謂此後之所以報賢母者，厥為專力革命，獻身黨國。十一年春，應召至桂，五另國父在韶關誓師北伐，而忽遭陳烱明之變，總統在滬千里赴難，侍國父於永豐艦中，以艱危自任，益見知於國父，倚昇日深。十二年奉國父命赴俄報聘考察，留意於彼邦革命建國之道。十三年六月，陸軍軍官學校成立於黃埔，總統受命任校長，事無鉅細，靡不躬親，用以培植革命武力之幹部，奠定北伐軍事之基礎，十四年三月，國父逝世，總統痛革命導師之云亡，益懍繼承革命大業之重荷。十五年七月就國民革命軍總司令職，率師北伐，直下湘·鄂·贛·閩諸省，軍行所至，人民如解倒懸，未及半年，東南奠定。十六年四月國府　都南京，總統以夙志稍償，乃功成引退，同年東渡　　返國後，與宋美齡女士結婚於上海，其時北方軍閥餘孽割據　，日本阻撓北伐，總統受命中央，再師師干，繼續北伐，攻京北京，東北易幟，統一大功於以完成。址七年及廿年，兩度出任國民政府主席，當時南方及中原之紛紜，使革命頻過危機，總統沉毅赴事，卒使國運化險為安。「九一八」變起，總統深知國防未固，隱忍持重，以來獲諒解而下野。「一二八」淞滬抗日之役，總統應全國喁喁之望，就任國民政府軍事委員會委員長，忍辱負重，興敵周旋，是後勵精圖治，建設國防，積極作禦侮自強之準備。廿三年，提倡新生活運動，以轉移風氣，次年導揚國民經濟建設，以利民生，廿五年十月，總統五十誕辰，海內外獻機祝壽，總統發表「報國與思親」一文，以個人往事之檢討，策同胞以共同致力於報國之道，感人甚深，顧不久西安變作，總統蒙難兩週，而以正氣之感格，卒使叛將懾服，脫險返京。</p>
<p>廿六年七七事起，總統以最後關頭已臨，遂領導全國奮起抗戰，次年三月，國民黨臨時全國代表大會開會於漢口，被推為總裁，復於是年創立三民主養青年團，親任團長，廿八年被推爲國防最高委員會委員長，並兼任行政院院長，是後指揮策劃，宵肝勤勞，卒能戡敵寇之兇熖，躋國運於復興。</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭之後，總統之卓識豐功，益為友邦朝野所共仰，三十一年二月訪問印度，是年國慶，英美聲明廢除不平等條約，次年一月，我與英美新約成立，於是百年桎梏一且解除，總統更電勉全國同胞，示以得此之非易，策其今後之努力。是年九月，十一中全會選任為國民政府主席，十月十日，於全國軍民一致擁戴中，隆重就職，十一月十二日與羅斯福總統，邱吉爾首相會議於開羅，討諭太平洋戰區軍政方略，決定東亞重建大計，次年有四國宣言之簽定，於是我國抗戰大義益彰，盟邦合作愈密，德義旣敗，日軍喪胆，至卅四年八月，日本戰敗力竭，宣吿無條件投降，堅持八載偉大艱苦之抗戰，至是勝利結束。</p>
<p>卅五年五月國府凱旋還都，總統率文武百僚祭吿國父之靈，益受全國同胞之熱烈擁戴。十一月十五日，國府召開國民大會，國民黨與靑年黨，民主社會黨及無黨無派之社會賢達，共同制定中華民國憲法，並於卅六年一月一日公布，同年十二月廿五日實行，實現還政於民之宿願，而立民國百年不拔之根基。</p>
<p>總統之偉大，在於平凡，其日常生活，無異常人。但較常人尤為間單樸素，總統倡導新生活，亦為新生活運動之實賤者。生活極嚴肅有規律，重視時間，甚於金錢，重視精神，甚於物質。不吸烟，不飲酒，飯食極簡單，即宴客，亦不備佳肴，僅四菜一塲，衣着亦但求整潔，而不華服。近十餘年間，有三分之二時間着軍服，經常僅三四套掉換，在家多便服，所選質料皆為國貨。住屋　一若普通平民，遇外出或駐節他處，輕車簡從，即使環境蕪雜，亦能處之泰然。每日淸早起身，靜坐片刻，即開始一日繁重之工作，恒在十四小時以上。總統任事專一，富於領導天才及冒險奮鬥，求眞理之精神，堅苦卓絕，自强不息，故能成其大業。</p>
<p>總統一生之偉大成就，除得力於幼時賢母良師之敎育以外，蔣夫人之影響亦甚大。夫人於廿三年協助總統，發起新生活運動，以提高國民知識道德，改善國民生活習慣，是為總統領導革命建國之重要社會運動。廿五年總統蒙難西安，夫人毅然赴難，安危與共，戰時不僅全力從事救傷保育之神聖工作，並陪伴總統訪間印度，參加開羅會議，又訪問美國，努力於對外宣傳，舉世欽佩。</p>
<p>總統追隨國父致力革命，始終以建設中國成獨立自由統一民主之國家，為平生志事，數十餘年來，總統與我中國為一部整然莫分之歷史。其間國步艱難，總統一肩承之，醒國魂，聚國力，爭國運之一，切努九，總統一身領導之。其艱苦，為前所未有，其成就，亦國史上任何一時代所不及。當國運最悲觀之時，總統獨堅定不移，當興情最惶惑之時，總統獨有其定見，當滔滔皆向環境屈服之時，總統獨秉其大無畏精神，知其不可為而為之。凡此事例，於北伐與抗戰中，類皆能道，若非總統如此堅强偉大之性格引導，我中華民族於近數十年中是否能歷千艱萬險而不倒，實大有疑問也。回顧過去總統奮其舉世傑出之軍事天才，完成北伐與抗戰之豐功偉業，更奮其傑出之外交與政洽天才，外睦强隣，內釋政怨，領導國家，邁向統一民主大道，故中國不能無總統，而展望將來，中國更不可一日無總統，當茲戡亂救國行憲甫始之時，更須賴英明不拔，衆望所歸之總統，能繼其領導，始能奠定國家永久和平統一之基礎，蓋我國家之盛衰，民族之存亡，皆繁於總統一人之身也。</p>

<h3>社論　民主憲政的光明前程</h3>
<p>——祝蔣主席當選第一總統</p>
<p>國民大會於昨晨十時選舉中華民國第一任總統，並當塲隆重開票，結果不出我們所料，我國最高領袖蔣公中正獲得二四三〇票當選，幾佔出席代表總額的百分之九十；這不僅是我國政治劃時代的創舉，而且也是我國歷史上最光榮的一頁。所以，蔣主席當選總統的消息一經傳出，首都各界人民於欣聞佳訊之餘，即爭相鳴爆竹慶祝，熱烈的情况，不减於三年前抗戰勝利的捷報傳到之後。此在上海各報亦紛紛出版號外，紅色喜報爭購一空，市民莫不與奮非常，各工廠商號，學校以及民衆機關，均將於今日自動懸旗慶祝。時當春光明媚之際，見滿街的鮮艷國旗招展，正足以象徵我國民主憲政前途的光明與燦爛。</p>
<p>舉國慶祝蔣公當選總統的狂熱，固足以表示全國人民擁戴蔣公的赤誠，但是我們決不可永遠沉浸在自我陶醉襄，只知歌功頌德自鳴得意；而應該在狂熟裏保持相當的冷靜，一方面要替未來的國家多想想，另一方面也該深切反省，如何盡民主國家人民對於政治所負的責任。所以我們願乘舉國慶祝蔣公榮膺總統之際，一述我們對於未來新政府所抱的期望。</p>
<p>第一，本屆國大選舉蔣公為第一任總統，不僅已完成了它所負的歷史任務，而且已使中國政治步入另一個新的階段。溯自蔣公率師北伐以來，先打倒勇於內戰的軍閥，完成了中華民國的統一；其後即對外抗戰，經過八年的艱苦奮鬥，始戰勝我們的强敵日寇，廠棄一切不平等條約，民族主義的目的可謂已全部實現；抗戰勝利後，又積極推行民主憲政，不顧共匪的阻襓和破壞，處處充分表現出盡其在我的精神，前年召開國大制定一部民主憲法；今年又開國大選舉總統，依照行憲的程序，一步步走上眞正民主憲政的大道，對於民權主義而言，也可以說已實行過半了。但是看國父倡導的三民主義尙未實行的，只有民生主義一項而已。而放眼觀察國內的情形，因為受了敵人的侵略與摧毀，元氣尙未恢復，而共匪接踵而來，企岡以武力擴充地盤，且不顧人民的死活，四處破壞國內的交通，摧毀人民的生產，以致民不聊生，社會浮動，連國家的命脈也陷於奄奄一息的狀態。因此我們認為我國目前最迫切的問題，莫過於安定民生；而安定民生之這，只要實行國父的民生主義，不僅能拯救人民於水深火熱之中，而且也是收拾人心唯一的最佳辦法。我國產業如何工樂化？我國土地如何改革？這些都行憲政府的當務之亟，也是我們老百姓喁喁望治的重點所在，</p>
<p>第二，蔣公是國內忠於憲法而忠於行憲的第一人，現在旣已當選為第一任總統，自能信守憲法不漁，並將依照行憲的程序執行總統的基本任務。目下全國的老百姓，都在看着他將向立法院提出什麽人做行政院長。我們也覺得行憲政府的第一任行政院長的人選，也有非常重要的關係，對於培養民主新政風，實為一大關鍵。過去政府的無能與實汚，已為中外所共知，巳是毋席諱言的了，所以我們渴望未來的新政府能以確立文官制度及提高公務員待遇來肅淸貪汚，並以選　尊能的辦法來提高行政效率·從此政府不僅可以面目一新，而且也能眞正做到與民更始了。</p>
<p>要之，蔣主席這次當選總統，雖為我國政治走上民主憲政的第一步，但給我們帶來無限的新希望。以上所述二項，不過是政治革新的起點，但願行憲的新政府不久就能以事實來滿足我們的願望，並為我國民主憲政開關一道光明的前程！</p>
<h3>本市財政的危機</h3>
<p>本市財政情形，因各項稅收，分別整理，收入漸有起色，收支差可相抵。在旺徵時期，市庫並有相當盈餘。逐月支出，都能按照預算，分別發放，從沒有聽到過甚麼欠薪欠款等情事發生。這在財政困難，普遍鬧窮的時候，不能不認為差强人意的一件事。</p>
<p>不過以後的情形，似乎不像過去那般順利了。據財政局公佈，三月份府局咨員工之薪給總額為一千三百億元，自待遇調整以後，即須增加至三千餘億元，而現在市財政的總收入，也不過三千二百大十五億元。那麽逐日收入的數目，至多僅够發放薪給，其他事業經臨各費完全無着；而且公敎人員的薪給，以後是要按月調整的，按照現在趨勢，物價的上漲，還沒有迄可小休的跡象，則此後收支的差額，自必愈距愈遠。長此下去，的確，要如田屬長所說：地方財政前途，殊雜樂觀了。</p>
<p>話雖如此，公家財政究與私人財政不同，無論如何困難，終不能不極力設法，勉張應付過去。所以如何打開這個難關，以及如何應付這個　局，這不但是市財政當局的重大課題，亦是每個市民所應該關切的事。</p>
<p>照常理論，凡是解決財政上的收支不平衡問題，不能不走着兩條老路，此即開源與節流。而開源之中，除掉現在走不通的募價一路以外，又不外增關新稅與整頓舊稅的兩條途徑。這兩條途徑，是不是走得通，一般市民是不是還有這負担能力，現在姑且不管·而事實上都不免要曠日持久，經過許多努力，方可逐步辦到。所以要單靠這兩條途徑來應付這與日俱增的虧額，至少，在技術上是個疑問。</p>
<p>員工薪給的支出，過去旣要佔到支出總額的四成弱，現在且要裏括支出總額的全部，或竟要超過這個總數，那麽，裁减員額這老調，似乎又不能不重彈一下。不過開見所及，各機關以事務太忙，都有人手不敷的呼聲，致行政院核定的市府新編制，不能不認為窒碍難行，再請變通，而且以舉辦新事業，或應付新環境之故，在這新編制以外，還有許多機構，正在不斷地增設。所以要走節流這條途徑，單講裁員，是無濟於事的，必須將新事業酌量緩辦，或將不急要的事業暫行停辦，方是根本的辦法。</p>
<p>但是事業的重要性，每每因主觀的不同而異其估價。有許多事業，一般人認為次要，乃至認為浪費，而在主管或利害關係人說來，則無不義正辭嚴，頭頭是道。因此這條路又走不通。所以展望本市財政的前途，是未可樂觀的。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　中國人民的選擇</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕民國三十七年四月十九日中午的南京，晴空裏國旗招展掩映春暉，報童們高呌號外在馬路上賽跑，和風送來興奮的聲音，爆竹伴着廣播：</p>
<p>「第一屆國民大會今天上午開選舉總統大會，蔣中正得兩千四百三十票，當選中華民國第一任總統。」全南京的人們都爭傳這動人的喜訊，因為每個人都覺得這是他自己的選擇，正如英國大使施諦文在會塲里知道了選舉結果以後說的；「這是中國人民的選擇，好！」</p>
<p>十九日的大會，久稱盛况空前，報到的代表差不多全體都已出席，更有些代表特別趕早的。會議的開端，一個已經法院判決當選不合法而喪失代表資格的女「代表」小鬧了一陣後，全部會議時間充滿了喜氣，代替了往常的呌囂，嘘聲，哄笑。主席台上後半的長案和座椅換成了木質的屏風，一共三十六個寫票間，樓上兩邊最後排的代表席也被移去，用粉紅色的綢屏風隔出十八個寫票間，樓上樓下照席次的十二個分區準備了十二只票匭。洪蘭友先花了半個多鐘頭帮忙主席周鍾嶽報吿選舉的種種注意事項，並且調兵遺將分配好監察員的崗位，十一點一刻開始投票。全塲發票，寫票，投票被分成了兩半個，從坐在前排的代表開始排好隊魚貫而行，憑着代表證領到票，進入僅可容身的寫票間，秘密的書了圈圈，把票子摺好送入票匭，便完成了這神聖的使命。洪蘭友立在發言台前，眼觀四路耳聽八方，東一聲「請非代表不要坐在代表的席次上」，西一聲「請攝影記者不要把我們的走道口堵塞住」，對坐在後排挨等的代表們更是道歉連聲。十時三十七分至三十八分，代表席上連着起了兩次掌聲，打盹睡着了的代表一個個驚醒，倦眼被水銀燈閃得發昏，過一會方知道是邊疆玫瑰左爾汗代表和國大之花唐舜君代表不約而同的一左一右先後投票。投過票的絡繹到休息室去休息，塲里的人數和洪　友額上的汗珠漸漸减少。</p>
<p>東張西望蹦來蹦去的記者這次不會被請出塲，洪蘭友說：「各位記者先生們，我可已實踐了我的諾言了。」</p>
<p>忙了一個多鐘頭，身上加佩紅緣紫綢條的監察員們，和幾位身脚不靈光的代表，在發票監察員趙君豪的股勤照拂下也投過票。周鍾嶽宣吿準備開票。</p>
<p>蔣中正的票數公吿牌擺在主席台右首，居正的票數公吿牌擺在左邊，代表們重又回到會塲來，二十幾位觀禮的使節也從台上下來坐在主席國席次的前排，他們都笑着不肯猜測選舉的結果。司徒大使說：「選舉是在公開的注意下與良好的秩序裏進行的，一定公正得很。」但請他猜猜誰會當選時，他却笑着說：「你可以和我一樣的猜得着！」伊朗代辦的女兒加地美小姐是唯一的女外賓，一雙美麗的大眼望望閃耀着日光燈輝的居正的票數公吿牌，她問：「誰是蔣委員長的競爭者？」這時參加渦印希瑞菲四使節呈遞國書典禮的王外長也穿了大禮服趕得來，他說蔣主席不來，他放棄了選舉權。</p>
<p>掌聲連續三分鐘</p>
<p>開票祇費了一個鏡頭，在緊張的情緒裏，洪蘭友把總票數兩千七百三十四報成了兩千七百四十三，周鍾嶽也將選舉推前了十年，他說：「中華民國二十七年，啊不！三十七年四月十九日？……」蔣中正得兩千四百三十票的結果使全塲鼓掌三分鐘不斷，居正的兩百六十九票也受到了足一分鐘的熟烈掌聲。十二點五十分在周鍾嶽顫巍巍的喜悅報吿：「蔣中正當選為中華民國第一任總統」之後，歡聲幾乎衝破了大會堂的屋頂，全場起立高呼中華民國萬歲三聲。遺數樂激動的熱情與喜訊，隨着散會，散出了會塲大門，散遍了南京，散遍了全中國。司徒大使懇摯的說：「中華民國的歷史已經從今天重新開始。」這話將昭告全世界關心中國的人。（四月十九日於南京）</p>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十九日電〕內政部宣布：義大利全國六十八省之每一省中，至十八日晚十為止，投票之選民已達選民總數百分之六十九至八十八。同時投票於今日下午二時截止後，前後結果雖尙待正式宣布，然羅馬已成傳共產黨在各處均遭慘敗。在羅馬·熱諾亞·米蘭·巴社亞等處，共黨莫不慘敗，僅在共黨據點之都林，人民陣綫佔有優勢。羅馬電臺於一時許宣布，加斯貝利總理及共黨領袖托格里亞蒂均將於十九日晚發表正式宣言，各報館外集有大批群衆以待最後結果之揭曉。</p>

<h3>法總理許曼表示　願與義誠摯合作　擬促成立法實施軍事改革</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕法總理許曼今日在波亞蒂埃城發表演說，謂法國之經濟局勢業已好轉，惟進步尙嫌不足。他說，法國之輸入仍超過輸出，此等情形尙須賡續數年，始可望有足量外幣尤其是美元，以支付輸入。許曼於述及國際局勢時謂國際團結之需要已日見增加，戰時之團結在戰後仍保持其價値。法國決不排除任何人之友誼，甚至砟日尙為法國之敵者，例如義大利等國，固係因其政權之壓迫而與自由和平之國家脫離，希望此次義普選結果，將使民主得在義大利半鳥上恢復，而樹立法義間之誠摯合作。</p>
<p>述及德國問題時，渠認必須基於民主原則，並兼顧安全需要而擬具解決辦法。他說建立中央集權的德國政府之任何計劇，將勝起德國的報復觀念及侵略帝國主義。許曼並透露俟國會復會時，政府將要求通過法律實施軍事改革。</p>

<h3>中紡估價結果呈核　全部地產逾二萬億　股票上市事下月可辦竣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕出售中紡公司之估價工作，已於上週正式結束，全部結果已由專人携京，呈交經濟部審核。中紡各廠，包括上海·靑島·天津三地之工廠在內，其設備，廠房價値，以民國廿六年之幣値計算，共達一萬萬九千三百萬元以上；如折合目前物價指數，為數驚人，各廠之地產尙不在內。在進行估價時，專家認為廠房設備之價値，折舊之關係至大，故以民國廿六年之幣値為標準。土地之價値，則決定於位置及效用，故以民國三十六年四月為標準。各廠全部之地產價値在二萬億元以上，以時値計算，則尙不止此數。此項國營事業出售之原則，前經決定出賣全部工廠之三分之二，而國家仍保持有其三分之一。上海青島天津三地均按此比例處理，非如外傳之所謂出售北方工廠而保留南方各廠。至於國家保留何類工廠，聞估價委員會已提供多項具體原則，大概供應軍用民用極有貢獻之中紡工廠，為國計民生起見，將予以保留。同時另一原則為規模過大之工廠，非私人財力所能承購經營者，亦不擬出售。另有若干工廠，經營成績特優，亦將由公家保留，以為示範之用。除此之外，將儘量轉為民營。至於中紡股票之上市，有關方面正積極籌備，聞承購者不乏看力集團，一俟出售之大部股權能有所確定，股票可隨即上市，有關方面下月內此事可完全辦竣。</p>

<h3>蔣主席當選總統　全市今懸旗慶祝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣主席在國民大會中以壓倒優勢的票數，獲選為中國首任行憲總統的喜訊，於昨午十二時五十五分由無綫電傳至上海，本報當時立即通知民營公營各電台，作緊急的號外廣播。中央日報和平日報新聞報亦立即發刋紅字的號外，用幾輛大卡車沿要道往來分送。記者目擊在南京路一帶，觀衆蜂擁塞途，爭拾號外觀看。京滬區鐵路特別然部和工會，得訊後在武進路及麥根路懸掛巨幅的「慶祝　蔣主席當選中華民國第一任大總統」紅布。固然，主席之當選，在市民看來是必然，路上的行人開玩笑似的說：「主席當選不是新開，不當選才是新聞！」可是，對於國家元首的新業譽，也不能抑止內心的欣悅。燃放爆竹，職呼口號，只是熱情流露的一斑！國人的氣質是比較沉着而不易激動的，但昨天是例外。</p>
<p>自昨晨九時起，本市各大公司和各公共團體的無綫電收音機，都在收聽這個歷史性的消息。國大會塲中一時一刻的動態，隨時由本市亞美麟記等六大電臺播送到上海。　十一時許，此間已獲悉到會國大代表二千六百餘人，投票者已逾半數。中間有短時間休息，介紹蔣主席日常起居生活情况頗詳，並提到主席因長期駐節陪都，頗愛好四川的榨菜。至十一時二十五分，電合中報吿全部投票完畢。以後的一小時內，會塲中集全力計票，到零時廿四分，傳來了佳音的前奏。電波裏說：今日首都天氣和暖，象徵我國今後國運昌隆。到零時三刻，全國人民所關切的結果公佈了，主席周鍾嶽以沉重的音浪淸楚地讀出！「蔣中正先生以二千四百三十票，當選為中華民國第一任大總統。居正先生二百六十九票」。收音機中接着傳出會塲中一片「民國萬歲」「總統萬歲」的歡呼聲浪。</p>
<p>上海市民為了表示對於元首的崇敬，今天全市將懸旗慶祝，並將舉行隆重的慶祝大會。堂握國家命運二十年的舵師，今日又受四億同胞的託付，負起了新的責任。他這次眞想誰退讓賢，但是畢竟擺脫不了歷史的責任。「國家的船」今天尙在險惡的風濤中，還需要萬衆一心來渡過難關，從上海市民的狂歡聲中，我們看出了國家的向心力量。</p>

<h3>審議小組今日開會　檢討收購剩米問題　民調會任主委談決不影響米價</h3>
<p>由民調會，社會局，美國中華救濟團，審計部等機構合組之審議小組會議，將於今日（廿日）下午，假南京路民調會地址召開例會，決定是否向市塲收購剩餘食米問題。屆時並將邀請本市新聞記者列席，以聽取外界意見。</p>
<p>據市民食調配會任主委顯羣語記者稱：本市近五十天來物價，如以米價作比較，二月底至十儿日止，上白粳批價漲三成，特高粳門市價漲二成，與其他一般物價之上漲率相比，米價尙稱穩定。過去每日南北市塲到米，最高爲二萬餘担，經當均在一萬餘担。而最近每日到米，己减至五千担以下，原因係運費工本激增，產地價格亦昻，如無錫米價，每日較本市平均皆高五萬元左右，致最近無錫等地運滬食米，日益减少，蘇州，靑浦米，亦有倒流，改運無錫者，因運費較省，不若由蘇州河運滬之較困難。但本市到米，雖已跌至五千担以下，而每月尙有四十七萬担食米之配售，故平均仍能保持每日到米之最高數字二萬餘担。米價所以能較其他物價穩定原因，即在於斯。至最近外傳收購剩餘食米，將刺激米價之上漲，殊不盡然。蓋市政會議最近決定，收購剩餘食米之目的，係保持食米來源，以增加存底。同時爲未雨綢繆計，正準備八·九月份靑黄不接時之配米。且收購之米，以糧商剩餘請求收購者爲限，故此次收購，決不致影響米價，使其有所彼動云。</p>

<p>本市轉趨下降，因無錫上日報低，且周浦一帶價均回降，人心疲軟，加以實銷不振，到貨較多，貨主抑價圖脫。北市塲下降較多，白粳高貨跌十萬，中次貨降十五萬，早薄稻及秈米均低十萬，特高粳則矗立於四百萬大關不動。南市塲普降五萬元，惟後市已見回升。民食調配會在南市售變質粳八百五十石，二市到貨合計八千六百八十七石。</p>
<p>麵粉疲堅互見，開市均呈疲憊，因蘇錫價均疲，又以米價下降，人心難以振作。老車粉曾低至一百三十八萬元，兵船一百三十九萬。後客帮視低價略吸，兵船升爲一百四十一萬，老車以一百四十萬收市，各昂一萬元。雜牌粉疲落，建成小五千，孔雀等牌降萬元。麩皮亦小萬五千元，小麥降爲二百萬。</p>
<p>雜糧一致挺升，因外匯提高之謠，甚為市上，客帮爭先競購，黄豆開市尙平，旋因油廠光顧，終升五萬，苞米靑島帮搶購，勁漲二十五萬元，菉豆猛漲要鉅，挺四五十萬元。揀靑北帮亦納，升十餘萬，紅糧亦挺十萬，芝蔴津帮復取，勁升四五十萬，生仁廣帮拉吸，再狂漲七八十萬。</p>
<p>食油掀起猛烈漲風，因原料價漲，及外匯掛高之謠言甚熾，人心振撼，貨主扳持。吉桶生油己竄出千萬大關，爲一千〇二十萬元，計漲三十萬。豆油漲勢更猛，同豐丘油初以八百六十五萬開出，後大統開八百八十萬，最後大有豆油回籠以八百九十五萬高價成交，狂漲四十五萬。淸油有中植廠吸購出口，市價己與豆油相仿，致各油均急起直追。小車蔴油漲五十萬，豆餅挺三四萬。</p>
<h3>各地米價</h3>
<p>無錫　〔本報無錫十九日電〕此間物價又展開全面漲風，棉紗最烈。白粳三八四萬四千元，白元三八三萬四千，羊秈三六六萬四千，埠秈三六一萬四千元，小麥三六〇萬，白麥三七一萬，麵粉一四〇萬三千，荳油八六五萬，棉紗一三九三〇萬。</p>
<p>蘇州　〔本報蘇州十九日電〕蘇州今日米價趨向下游，市塲做開糙粳三二六萬元，白粳三六五萬元，門售白米三九〇萬元</p>
<p>桂林　〔本報桂林十九日電〕米價漲勢仍劇，今達二百四十萬。各糧價均陸續上昇。</p>
<p>蕪湖　〔本報蕪湖十九日電〕米價數日來已昻至三五〇萬元，今回低爲三四五萬元。</p>
<h3>收購桐油　價格提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局收購出口物資審價委員會，昨（十九）下午在中央銀行舉行審價會議，決定提高桐油收購價格，上海，梧州兩地，每担八五〇萬元，廣州每祖九百元，以上收價均較前增加一百萬元。</p>
<h3>台糖上漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市因十七期今日雖照常開配，但價格又見調整，各檔普加六十萬元，冰糖加九十萬元，額照舊，仍爲二四粗白一種，不搭冰糖。又値實銷轉活，價乃一致向上，白糖均見新高價。公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白初爲五百三十九萬元，旋升至五六十萬元，好起二三十萬元。四半白袋裝六百二十萬元，升廿五萬元。一二砠六百十萬元至十三萬元，二〇中砂白初爲五百十萬元，後步升至二十五萬元，升二十五萬元。台赤較平，爲四百九十萬元，升十萬元。棧單交易起落差度爲十餘萬元至近二十萬元。</p>
<p>土糖汕提靑爲三百廿萬元至廿五萬元。棉赤三百四十五萬元，計四百包之譜。興化白高貨五百四十萬元，升二三十萬元。興赤三百二十萬元至三四十萬元，刁靑升近十萬元，爲三百八十三萬元，後叫八十五萬元，成交四五百件。海南赤二百四十五萬元至二百五六十萬元，升十餘萬元，計二百餘包。</p>
<h3>新龍井疲挫</h3>
<p>專供內銷之龍井，査本年度新貨，自上市迄今，初以買戶爭購，潛勢鋒鋩畢露，但邇因天津等地茶銷步懈，而產區到源踵趾相接，且品質日形蒼老，市氣乃轉軟化。同業互做之價，無一不再削落。他若存底將罄之陳茶，執主扳售如昔，續呈盤旋之狀。洋莊茶市依然堅穩不衰，賣戶趦趄，惟出口商對三十六年度平水珠茶，則仍埀靑不衰，以言趨勢，在此情形中，遂無下墜之象云。</p>
<h3>香港金匯行情</h3>
<p>〔本報香港十九日電〕黄金三三五，美元五·六六，國幣八，申電七六，港府公佈，去年破獲走私黄金，共値四百萬元。　〔合衆肚香港十九日電〕此間金匯市塲，現金交易，十九日價格如下：</p>
<h3>星期存欵利率</h3>
<p>不致刺激市塲黑克利率</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自證券遞交取消後，有若干商業銀行經營爲期一週之「星期存款」，利率高至二角以上。記者昨日特請金管局李立俠對此事發表意見，李氏稱：站在金管局之立塲，凡存款利率低於二角四分放款利率者，均聽其自由經營，不加過問。同時，星期存款之利率匯　　但不致刺激市場之黑市利率；因決定黑　利率者，爲放款利率而非　存款利率。</p>

<h3>紗市買氣熾烈　高價層出不窮</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，利買消息頻傳，漲風趨烈。又遇布市勁升，股市上竄，因此激動買風，新高價層出不窮。四二支監鳳晨開即二億四千萬關，廿一支雙馬甫開出即高喊一億五千儿百萬有吸，前者因客銷去化未見暢旺，中途曾回進四千萬關，爲二億三千九百萬。將派臨收，仍告回堅。終以開盤行情收市，續挺六百萬。四二支金城及水月亦漲起九百萬左右，後者受檯面帮及散戶之拉抬，市價瘋狂上竄，雖中途當局以抑平漲風計，突然懸牌，接受同業請購，除雙馬未見動搖外，餘均趨回落，結果終以一億六千四百萬罕見之新高價收市，劇升一千六百萬之鉅。廿支各檔均跳起三百萬至一千三百萬之間</p>
<p>昨晨棉布，明平暗堅，人心頗穩，利多消息頻傳，港匯再縮，染廠吐售轉稀，散戶拉提甚勁，本街布號，一路競進，十二磅龍頭細布，開盤四九五萬元，一度盤旋後，謠傳外匯提升，人心極度緊張，市上籌碼吿枯，猛挺至五〇二萬元高價收市。最後聞棉紗股市邁進，再創五〇五萬新高價，尙少賣出。週六紡建公司供售四君子元嗶嘰准購單，加價念五萬，喇叭童細布准購風加價十八萬元，市况俏俐非常。</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡建公司昨（十九日）循例開售棉紗，計十一種。核售價二十支雙鯉一三〇〇〇萬元，十支立馬八〇〇〇萬元，十六支紅月一〇四〇〇萬元，卅二支仙桃一七三〇〇萬元，卅二支雙股仙桃一八二〇〇萬元，四十支藍鳳一八九〇〇萬元，四十支TK彩球二三四〇〇萬元，四十二支雙股立馬二二八〇〇萬元，四十二支雙股藍鳳二三四〇〇萬元，六十支日光二五〇〇〇萬元，六十支雙股日光燒毛三二八〇〇萬元，申購單計五八五張，售出紗一一七六件，合廿支紗二一〇五件。</p>

<p>昨現棉市况，初尙平穩，繼聞紗布上揚，人心堅挺，喊價甚高，趨勢鋒俏，花管會開價亦按市提高，多頭獲利有吐，交易始行展開，惟成交數量不旺。計做開漢口細絨一九八〇萬，涇陽二四五〇萬，大中集二一二〇萬至二一三〇萬，火機一七五〇萬，太倉一八八〇萬，以上均送公庫價，周浦籽花四四四萬。</p>
<h3>絲市趨堅</h3>
<p>人絲昨開市，東洋升至二三六〇〇萬元，天橋二三五〇〇萬元，旋因扒吸紛紜，價隨拾級而上，迨至午收，東洋升至二四三〇〇萬元，天橋升至二四二〇〇萬元，金三馬旭字均至二四一〇〇萬元，較週六升達千萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>絲市因人　趨堅，隨之轉俏，晨開CD兩級較週六各升五百萬元，午收成交D級現貨五担，價三六〇〇〇萬元。輯里干經，隨之上升至三一〇〇〇萬元，惟交易稀少，外銷因歐美無交易，市况沉寂。</p>
<h3>華股買氣煥騰　永紗創新高價</h3>
<p>華股昨業外之刺激，己使忍無可忍之買氣，一發而不可收拾。新買推動，空方急補，永紗創新高峯，尙有勤興等十一種漲停。</p>
<p>晨開時業外已有刺激表演，人心己俏，永紗開一九一〇元高價，開後謠傳外匯牌價調整，進至一九四〇元，二二八號等猛售，跌至一八九〇元。外匯牌價未更，曾退至一八九〇元低價，六〇號等來進，再升爲一九四〇元，又被賣退至一九一五元。圈外刺激更殷，仍漲到二〇二〇元，七六號等趁高尙有了結，退至一九八五元，一〇五號等紛購，午收升爲二〇三五元，中絲及中泥迫成漲停板，除華新大通微升，永紗恒豐永公榮豐景綸火柴麗安漲半成外，餘均好起一成。</p>
<p>後市開出即升爲二〇八〇元，自二〇九〇元起，賣退至二〇四〇元，一五七號等進至二〇八五元，廣帮等有所脫手，賣到二〇五五元，二〇六等紛進，國行雖有差進，昻至二一一五元高價，收市爲二一一〇元。中絲中泥中法永業聯華恒豐統益勤興閘北大通信和等十一種漲停板外，永紗榮豐華新信誼景綸火柴麗安國貨商務新華各漲少許迄半成不等。塲外各未上市股票亦見挺秀，自微升迄漲半成不等。</p>
<h3>統債外股上升</h3>

<p>外股昨新買更亟，業外刺激推波逐瀾，　電再來助買，中途絕少掙扎。怡紗自二八四萬開後，人心並不因査究而减少興趣，步昂至二九四萬左右，始暫吿定。結果較上週六計怡紗英聯紙版航業鋼業各升一成光景，餘股好起半成左右。</p>

<h3>敎育與民主</h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>民生政治的主要條件，第一是敎育，第二還是敎育。敎育的量和質都是民主政治成功的必要條件。這道理太明顯了，用不着作者在這裏來多說。本文的任務絕不在說明敎育對於民主的重要性（這是人所共知的），而是在說明當代民主國家在高談民主時，忽視敎育的一種矛盾現象。</p>
<p>當代民主國家中，美國自然是首屈一指的。美國不惟以最民主的國家自居（事實上也許是如此），而且負起了保障民主，宣傳民主，及以民主敎育他國的大責任。為拯救民主，美國參加了第一次的世界大戰，復參加了第二次的世界大戰，美國對於民主政治的功績，我們是不應忘記的。我們不能不感謝美國，美國確是民主國家的救星。可是當美國正在高談民主的時候，美國敎育却發生了絕大的危機，美國當局對於敎育却有忽視的現象，這不能不令人驚訝。這話若自我們說來，或自他國人說來，也許可以認為是惡意的宣傳。但說這話的人，說美國敎育發生危機的人，並不是他國人，而是美國的敎育家。美國敎育家班占命，潘氏（Benjamin　Fine）去年出版了一書，名呌：「我們的兒童被欺騙了」Our　Chldren　AreCheated）。這書作者尙沒有見到。作者只見到米失勒氏（LncySprague　Mitchell）在本年二月七日的「週六文學評論」（Saturday　Revieur　of　Literature）所發表的一篇書評。從這一篇書評裏，略為透露了該書的內容。</p>
<p>依照潘氏的調查，美國戰後的敎育發生了極大的危機。美國全國各級學校，由幼稚園到大學，都普遍發生缺少敎師的恐慌。因缺少敎師，結果便有六千間學校關門。不關門的學校，所聘任的敎師，也多半是不够資格的。在戰前，不够資格的敎師四百人中只有一人，可是現在七人中便有一人。即從他業轉行的敎師也比戰前多了一倍。在一九四一年戰事發生時，美國全國有三十五萬的敎師齜開敎室，而在戰後重回敎室的，却僅是極少數。同時，美國的師範學院目前註册的學生也遠比戰前為少，可是各級學校的學生人數却在迅速地增加。這樣師荒現象自必日見嚴重。為什麽尖國會發生師荒現象呢？為什麽美國人不肯當敎師呢？潘氏吿訴我們，這是因為美國敎師所得薪水過少的緣故。目前美國敎育界的收入遠低於工業界的收入。以去年一年而論，全美敎師的薪水，其平均數是，每週每人約四十美元。然其中却有一萬位敎師每週所得不到十二美元，復有二十萬人，每週所得不過二十五美元或更少。這樣的數目，即不結婚的單身敎師也不易維持生活，何况多數敎師尙有家庭負祖呢？所以現在美國有許多地方的敎師為要求加薪之故曾發生過罷敎的事件。而且美國敎師，不惟薪水低，即社會地位也低。許多地方都不尊重敎師的地位。敎師一結婚，便常被免職。也有吿訴敎師不當吸紙烟，告訴敎師不當在公共地方喝酒，吿訴敎師應到那一間敎堂禮拜，吿訴敎師應做這個，做那個；至敎育的重要方針，許多敎師反不與聞。這不是輕視敎師的人格和地位嗎？此外，學校設備也遠不如戰前。許多初級和中級學校的校舍，非常破舊，沒有衛生設備，沒有圖書室或實驗室。大學復有人滿之患，沒有錢來加建校舍。一個世界上最富最强的民主國家，而其敎育狀况如此，這眞有些令人難於置信。因此米失勒氏感慨地說：「這是地球上一個最富庶，最繁榮的民族的一幅奇怪岡書。這民族是早把全民敎育視為民主柱石的，而且正當原子世紀開始，全民敎育顯極需要的時期。沒有時期是像現在需而要理解科學這樣大，也沒有時期像現在需要理解我們自身的民主文化及他國的文化這樣廣泛的被承認。我們的國家正在為達到她在世界上的新地位而掙扎，正在為其他民族解釋民主而努力。可是在這樣的嚴重關頭，我們却在敎育上欺騙我們的兒童，因而便欺騙民主，欺騙世界。眞的，這種景象是我們大　　家都當起而有所動作了。」</p>
<p>看了上面這一段報吿之後，我們的感想為如何呢？我們自然沒有資格來批評英國的敎育。我們的敎育，在質和量的方面，都比美國落後不知多少。嚴格說來，我們的敎育簡直等於零。可是我們也學美國開始談民主了。國民大會正在開會，正在謀奠立我國民主政治的基礎。可是作為民主政治基礎的敎育，則怎樣呢？學生有在罷課的，敎師有在罷敎的，全國的敎師都在飢餓綫上掙扎，美國敎師最低待遇，據上面統計，每月至少有五十美元。我國敎師以大學敎授最高的待遇來說，每月尙不到三十美元（黑市價）。以美國這樣發達的敎育，美國人尙發出『欺騙兒童，欺騙民主，欺騙世界』的呼聲。那末，我們自己當說些什麽呢？讓國民大會的代表和政府當局自己說罷！作者不必說了！</p>
<h3>叔本華的藝術論</h3>
<p>— 少雄</p>
<p>藝術的活動比起科學的活動來，其方法是不相同的。藝術家之選擇題材，是採取某一個別的人或物，而力謀表現之為一個分離的實體，且用最準確的方式，把一切牠的特殊性，雖至微細的特殊性，都表現出來。科學不然。科學以處理抽象觀念為其工作，而每一觀念都是代表各數的個體的；對於這些觀念，科學在界說之及指明其特徵。我們可以說，藝術的方法在注重特殊，科學的方法在注重普遍。不過，我們却不能因此便謂藝術為無意義，瑣碎，甚或是兒戲的追求。因為藝術的性質，乃在以一例而代表千萬例，在把單獨的個體，人或物，謹愼而詳盡的表現之，從而把這一人或物所隸屬的類槪念也顯示出來。例如把某一人的生活的一事或一狀，忠實地，完全地，描寫出來，也就是把構成這一事之成其為這一事的一切個體都恰切的顯露出來，我們便可從這一特殊觀點，而獲得關於人性本身的觀念的明瞭而深入的洞見。所以藝術方法和科學方法雖不相同，而在處理單獨的事實上，却有多少相同處。植物學者之研究植物，是從無窮的植物界裏取出一朵花來研究，把這一朶花加以分析，用為樣本，以便從這一單獨的樣本，去證明植物本身的性質。詩人也是一樣。詩人是從擾攘無窮的人類生命中，選擇出某一景况，某一狀態，某一感覺，由之而對我們表明什麽是人的生命和特性。從這一點來說，科學和藝術都是由特殊而達乎普遍。</p>
<p>美是形式，是理型，所以藝術的表現，叔氏認為即在設法使形式和質料分離。藝術的要素實存於這種分離中，因藝術的目的即在使我們獲得形式或理型的知識。一個藝術品的要素，首在光把形式而不把質料給我們，次在使觀賞者沒有誤認其為質料的可能。所以一個臘做的人或物，不能產生美感，不能算為是藝術品，即因為牠很容使我們誤認為是眞的人或物。牠不僅把形式給我們，也把質料給了我們。所謂形式，其意義不僅是幾何的，也是哲學的，故顏色，平面，結構等等，也可算是形式。大理石的雕刻，固把純粹形式給我們，即有顏色的油書，也把純粹形式給我們。我們不會誤認油書上的人或物為眞的</p>
<p>叔氏這一篇論文的主要部分，略如上述。他這種藝術理論，不見得現代的藝術家都可以贊同，但無疑的是一種很値得我們注意的理論。（續完）</p>
<h3>學林樷話（十六）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>「出版自由」</p>
<p>民治之理想必須寄託於健全的輿論，倘無言論自由則民主政治即無法生存。維護新聞出版事業最有功者尤　美國哲斐孫總統（一七四三至一八二六）。他曾說：「國家權威屬於人民」。「人民可以利用報紙以監督政府，政府也可以利用報紙把政務實際的情况，充分報吿於國民」。「言論果能自由，人人果能看報，這便是最安全的途徑」。一七八六年一月十六日，哲氏致卡林敦（E．Carington）的信裏說：一假使報紙與政府兩者不能並存，必須任去其一的話，我們應無所膽顧，去政府而存報紙一。其能態度之堅決若此。他又說：「報紙是啓迪國民最有效的工具，要使一般國民有理性，有道德，有急公好義之風，還得借重報紙的力量」。美國歷任總統無不重視報業，一九〇一年老羅斯福總統有言，「在美國最重要的職業當推記者，包括雜誌編輯在內，風行全國的定期刋物尤足令人重觀」民治與報業實有相依為命之勢。</p>
<p>已故紐約時報主持人奧克期（Aolph　SimonOchs一八五八年生，一九三五年卒）。為美國報業史上極重要之人物，於提高報業水進貢獻至多。氏於一八九六年接辦紐約時報，曾自遵旨趣有云：「新聞之編輯貴於簡明而富於興味，其措辭用字應為上流社會所容許。新聞之傳作書力使其迅速，其取材則應一秉大公，無所偏袒，無所瞰忌，不為黨派門戶之見所蒙蔽。凡聞係重大之公共問題，均可以本報為論壇，供有識之士之公開討論，以反映社會上種不同之意見」。此段所言似若平淡，但欲求其實踐，誠非易事。歸納言之，誠意，公道，認眞，明辯，博識，五者乃奧克斯所倡之報人五歲。新聞學成為現代一種專門學術，源於美國，紐約時報為一最大之實驗室。以可靠性，公正性，淵博性，三者為評判之標準，該報誠為美國首屈一指之大報，論其規模與設備即倫敦泰語士報亦相形見拙。</p>
<p>現在是四海一家的時代，第一流的大報都要具有世界性，於是新聞的來源成為，當前重大問題。一九四四年九月間，美國國會會有一決議案，略謂國際間有交換消息的責任，各國記者均應獲有採訪消息與傳播消息的便利，各國政府不應有所歧視。現代國際關係極為繁複錯綜，各民族可藉交換事實與觀念的方法，以謀增進彼此的辯解。新聞的自由流通實為維護世界和平的重要因素。現正由美國發起締結一國際協定，名為新聞自由協定。該協定將保證各記者有不受檢查之自由，但由於國家軍事安全所需要者自屬例外，新聞自由的主張能否成功，當然不是無條件的，出版界自身的努力尤為重要。</p>
<p>負責任的自由為西方文化的傳統。羅斯福總統標舉四大自由，首為言論自由與發表自山。（Freedum　of　speech　and　expression）負責任的精神實為言論自由應付的代價。最近美國芝加哥大學接受時代周刋出版社與大英百科全書公司捐款二十萬美元，指定為「言論自由研究會」的費用，研討範圍兼及無綫電，電影與書業。該會委員十三人以芝加哥大學名譽校長赫卿（Robert　H，Hutchins）為主席，哈佛大學退休之哲學敎授霍京（W．E．Hocking）亦為委員之一，研究結果由霍京撰為報吿書，名為「出版自由」。（Freedomof　the　press，一九四七年芝加哥出版）其結論謂言論自由之危機在於出版界之自身。極權國家禁止發表反對派的言論，固不足道。但自由若被濫用而不加限制，或所載消息是非顚倒，或誇張煊染言過其實，或助長種族的偏見，或煽動人間的仇恨，或迎合庸俗，甘居下流，即世所稱之黃色新聞，如此之類均為報業潛伏之危機。在十九世紀視個人自由為無上重要，現在則公衆之利益，社會之安寗，至少應與個人自由並重。任何自由均為有條件的，補偏救弊實為必要。出版界未能盡其言責，此不僅為報館編輯單方面之事，政府社會與讀者亦皆與有責任。美國為最能重視言論自由的國家，但自由與負責，兩者如何達於美滿和諧之境，迄今仍為有待解決的問題。負責任的自由原為一種理想，亦當為人類永無止境的努力。</p>
<h3>謠言心理（三）</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>我們在上文已經提出，謠言因在記憶中的回爐作用，便產生「誇大，失眞，理解，繁複」諸特徵。一般的意象都槪念化了，個性沉泊在類型中去。越模糊，越空洞的意象，便越容易走上這一條路上去，而謠言便是在這種曖昧意識中繁殖着。</p>
<p>例如我們說到古代的美人，心目中根本沒有具體的印象，因為誰也不曾親眼看見過這樣，我們便極容易將她槪念化，所以有『高一分則太長，矮一分則太短，增一分則太肥，减一分則太瘦』的不落邊際語。換句話說，我們祗知道她美麗極一了—典型的美人——不太長，不太矮，不太肥，不太瘦。結果自然是「誇大」與『失眞』。正因為我們祗有依稀的印象，一切都空空洞洞，遐思便極便在這些架格上添顏色。所謂理解，亦稱文飾，無中生有，自然趨向繁複。因此越沒有眞消息，新聞越貧乏，謠言便應運而生。撲滅謠言的最善辦法，當然無過於眞理的儘量開放。</p>
<p>這樣，我們便可以明白為甚麼謠言是戰時與軍隊中最流行。軍事秘密籠罩了所有的行動，一切都在『守口如瓶』中。同時，因為危險的切身利害，每個人都急於知道當前的局勢與目下的行動。一方面有知識的急切需要，一方面又「諱莫如深」，摸不出頭腦，謠言便盛行着。「空穴來風」，謠言同然是由於新聞的缺乏而來，但人們渴望新聞的情緒，更是謠言的根太原因。</p>
<p>從社會心理學講，謠言的製造者與傳播者常常有他的作用。聽謠言或接受謠言，固然是起於一種心理的欲求，製造或傳播謠言，也就為着滿足另一種心理欲求。這就是人之好勝心。能道人之所不知道的，顯得自己的消息靈通，似乎也是出人頭地的一種辦法。祇是為着這種迫力，謠言的傳播便快過「置郵而傳命」。有些謠言傳播之快，比新聞還遠。　（未元）</p>
<h3>老子論　道德仁義禮智</h3>
<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>老子之論這，德，仁，義，體，智，有云：「失道而後德，失德而後仁，失仁而後義，失義而後禮。夫禮者，忠信之薄，而亂之首；前識者，道之華，而愚之始；——是以大丈夫處其厚，不處其薄；居其實，不居其華；故去彼取此。」（卅八章）茲詮釋其義，以見老子之深意。</p>
<p>此章論人事演化之迹：由混而畫，由合而分，由純而雜，由樸而華。道體之初，混合純樸，靜之境也；反而動，散著而人若物以生。人亦自然運化之一境，與物俱秉道之一體以為德。其始也，去道未遠，德全而各得其所，混然有以相容。寖假而德或虧，有弗得其所，則不相容而爭端起；聖人輒倡為仁，以期失所者之相容，而爭端以泯，——是仁所以救夫德之虧也。仁所以為愛，唯愛乃能相容。德虧，倡仁以資彌補；顧彌補之術，其用有窮，則又倡為義，以濟其窮。義所以制宜。蓋為仁有心於用愛，厥愛輒亦難普，不若德全者之無心於相容，而混然有以相容也；則立之義，以示用愛之厚薄等差，期於愛不遍及之中，其所及者，等差厚薄咸得其宜，則失德者雖不能混然相容，有厚薄等差之愛行乎其間，固亦猶愈於已也。顧有等差厚薄，則節文起，而體興焉。義所以制夫等差厚薄之宜，禮則義之節文也。且夫等差厚薄，別之事也；有別，則不能無心；有心，則有誠妄眞偽。節文之所以示等差厚薄者，往往不誠不眞，而妄與偽輒於是乎寫，此體之所以為「忠信之薄，而亂之首」也·「忠信」者，眞誠之謂，行體往往眞誠不足，故日「忠信之薄」。忠信簿，則詐僑起；詐偽者，爭奪之階；故曰「亂之首」也。前識者，智之事也。智之小者見道不全，未得「這紀」，（見十四章）而動輒執古御今，（問上）自詭以為前識，不知因果之間，其機甚微，其事至靖，用智以弄巧，其效乃反拙，以其所識於前者，非道之實，區區之智，適足以滋其愚，故曰「前識者道之華，而愚之始」。「大丈夫」，有志學道之士。「厚」者，道德；「薄」者，仁義與禮。「實」道也；「華」，智也。學道者服膺乎道德之實，其淳樸之懷混然與物相容，無所親疏厚薄乎其間，無所用於仁義禮智，故曰「去彼取此」，——「此」，道德也，「彼」，仁義禮智也。</p>
<p>夫道德仁義禮智，人生之要，故老子論人生，首標是數者，明其發生之序，見厭本末，然後知所去取。惟老子重道德，而輕仁義禮智。蓋晚周之世，詐偽繁興，爭奪大起，儒家者流倡仁義禮智以救之，其效適足以滋亂離，老子輒立其本，明道德之要，期人復淳反樸，而風俗以移。老子固知世運之行，常往復於合分治亂之間，晚周之世，分亂已極，勢宜反矣，老子乃假立言以輔之反，俾生民稍免於塗炭，其用心可謂苦矣。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「亡書久似憶良朋」</h3>
<p>— 惕齋</p>
<p>好像是放翁的詩句：「得劍乍如添健僕，亡書久似憶良朋」，對於我們這此會經藏過幾册舊籍而又飽歷憂患的人，眞是頗有親切之感。幼時讀金石錄後序，對易安居士的遭遇，每為浩歎，然而尙不甚了解歸來堂鬥茶覓句之樂，僅僅是民族觀念的悲憤；年事增長，個人利害得失，有所攖懷，則又多着一層哽咽，雖說是我執的清根，畢竟也是一種中年哀樂的反映，不必自諱亦毋庸為說者也。</p>
<p>中國乃是多災多難的國家，偏偏又歷史長而文戲多，可以緊人愛戀者是那樣夥颐，爭城爭地者是以毀滅為目的，而古物愛好者偏偏想從刀劍烟硝之中爭取這些殘燼，其原始已是充滿悲劇的氣氛矣，而費盡力量得到的滄海一栗，又輒於不得已中喪去，其懊惱更何須談？羅雪堂在五十日夢痕錄中講及安陽甲骨殘片。在田中累累皆是，乃收得數十麻袋，此即今日價値千餘萬的書契前後編之原料。與此可以媲美的，又有羅氏在學部時所見的內閣大庫檔案，也是盈數十麻袋，業已裝好等待稱斤賣爛紙，因其力持，才得收購保管，即今日商務所印的明淸史料數巨帙，而未經整理者還不知有若干。可是最近我們才聽到羅氏旅順寓居的大批古物皆在勝利後被人以大卡車運走，沿途載重難行，便隨意棄置若千在路隅，幸虧羅氏先死，不然豈不可以在「集　篇」（氏自傳名）大哭特哭，聞其哲嗣福頤，已入北大任敎，想來必也可以寫成多一少篇一唱三嘆的文章，供人欷戲憑弔吧？往日讀陳登原氏中國典籍聚散考，知道所謂牛弘五厄在中國幾於成為家常便飯，聊城楊氏海源閣的宋板書可以被劉珍年的餘部及股匪當作擦大烟槍的廢紙，足示我們民族的奢豪。紀文達公曾有句云，「山河泡影談何易，一見公羊涕不禁」，那也不過見到大家式徵，奴婢以宋本公羊傳包裏點心而已，去擦烟具猶復有間，文達如生在三百年後，不知又作何等慨嘆！</p>
<p>誠然，書卷堆積案頭，亦復不見得就天天要看，或隨時要用，但這有似乎富人之於鈔票，多些不一定是完全花去，看了也足為一樂，於是好財貨也就成為業餘的性質，初不必計及其使用價値，蓄書想亦　爾。特我們認識幾個字，而又沒一有學會跑交易听或有其他端木子貢先生的殖賄本領，到底還得仰賴幾本書寫文或騙人吃飯，對書篇之懷念，則又有了比功利主義更大的迫切，殆如貧窶之於米鹽柴薪，大有飢寒不得衣食之意，此其為苦，又與唯美派有殊。所以若以書卷喻作良朋，我所憶者乃是可以通財急難的知交，而非純然良夜清談的吟侶也。也許有人笑此為俗態，可是事實這樣，又將奈何？</p>
<p>我個人治學，頗偏於雜，什麼都是淺嘗輒止，看了學者先生們的窄而深的工夫，羨慕固亦有之，可也難免有些畏懼，無他，覺得「用志不紛」一句，實是枯窘與單純的代名詞，恐非俗人所敢想望也。以此我買書的範圍，簡直全無限制，除去分亳不懂的物理數學等外，凡可以增加一點常識的，都不擯棄。而昔日的書價，也眞是便宜，魯迅全集賣二十元，還可以打一八折，才十六元耳，等於今日之一千六百萬！相去為一百萬倍，試問此可令人相信邪？近來因為要敎一點歷史，而又涉及考古與史料，因而想到那以二十四元法幣買到的周金文存及十數元買的意齋集古錄，三馬路店中的三代吉金文存乃昂至兩千萬，只好舌橋不能下！前兩天，其書店來信相吿，收到東方學報數册，每册索價二十五萬！這都是從前不肯出錢買的東西。隨意一種淸人筆記的刻本，不過三數册者，均要三四十萬以上，那天朋友吿訴我在蘇州冷攤以十餘萬元買到淸代的蕃屬叢書，直是可遇而不可求之事，可惜沒有像張廷濟其人，每天每月把市價加以紀錄（張氏淸儀閣古器物文皆紀得價），以備百世之後的參考！不必更遠，即以三年來的變化為準，豈不已是三代以上乎？</p>
<p>僅有的一點書，都在　城　中，算計起來，睽別也有十年開外了。始而是日本人來了，要燒，要搜有不少的雜誌新書淪入戰火之刦，繼而是戰事擴大，存書的地方成了兵燹的殘餘，則僅留下的一點也被盜賊拿光，最後則國土光復以後，又來了新的戰火，以致想去憑弔一下都沒有可能，這就十足體會了憶良朋的「憶」字。然而良朋却不乏從飛機，從輪船歸來者，即使是嘗歷了千辛萬苦，大家總可以執手呵呵而笑，或是訪舊半為鬼，驚呼熟中腸的放聲一哭，那些沒有知識的老友，可永遠不會回轉了！假使他們是有知的，當自己付於刦灰，或是轉入一個新朋友的手中時，作何感想？據我所知，書的新主人大致也都改變性質了，不是交易所來的，便是棉紗號肥皂廠的夥友，從前寒士常喜自榜一聯，有云：「書田無稅子孫耕」，我勸諸位措大，還是歇歇心吧，書中雖無黃金屋，但書却非黃金屋不入，他已成為文化市塲上的阿嬌了！</p>
<h3>說自殺</h3>
<p>— 海燕</p>
<p>最近各地又有一些男女學生自殺——年來學生自殺，累見不鮮，這些時却引起大家紛紛研究自殺原因，其實原因是無須研究的，還不明白嗎？社會便是這樣一個社會。</p>
<p>倒是從人生態度方面來分析自殺者的心理有點意思。學生是知識分子，與富室千金或蓬門碧玉的「匹夫匹婦自經溝凟」，純然由於腦筋簡單者不同。大抵推測自殺之原因是「消極」，「感覺人生乏味」。但我覺得對人生如果眞是早已感消極乏味的人，也許倒不會毅然覓死；相反，恐怕多半却是對於人間抱有頗多希望，對於人生不乏相當興味的人，結果絕望來了，於是對於自我要求總淸算，向希望索還積欠而以死結之。自然，也有像芥川龍之介那一型的人，早已感覺生的厭倦，從容而死，但總不是多數。</p>
<p>消極的人生觀者大抵採取慢性自殺，此種人不容易挽回其觀念；倒是一受刺激，立刻自盡者可以不死：祗要使他有所宣洩，且可變為有積極向人間惡勢力鬥爭的戰士。因為越是對於人間無留戀，越反映他在絕望前是對於人間很執着很留戀的，不，很親切的，否則他必無自殺的決心而早就慢性自殺了。自殺者每有絕命書，可為一證；如果毫不覺得人間還有「味」，還於可戀，何必留此一痕跡於人間。這潰書的本身便是「味」，還是「留」給廣義的可「戀」者。因此，如能給他更大的「味」，而這「味」是可為排除一切環境上的乏味的因子的，何嘗不能挽回他的永生之念呢？</p>
<p>問題是怎樣才使他們獲得更大的味——人生戰鬥的機會。</p>

<p>我對於寫文章，向來抱定一個宗旨日。就是在寫不出的時候，決定不寫。而在下筆的時候，意盡即止，也決不拖泥帶水，敷衍成文。有時應某編者之囑，非在倉猝間作急就章的例外情形，亦所不免。那往往使我很窘，因為在寫不出的時候，眞的連一個字都寫不出。</p>
<p>某次，我文思艱澀，而編者限期匆促，次日早上即須交卷。我一直到當天晚上，上某戲院看電影，在開映前的五分鐘，忽有所悟。方才用鉛筆在隨身所帶的一本等記簿上，將文稿寫完。</p>
<p>平時，我對於有寫文章的時間或興趣而寫不出的時候，也有我的應付方法，因為我覺得要找出寫文章的工夫，頗不容易，偶得片刻空閑，豈可交臂失之。這時，我往往抽出一本裝幀精美，排印講究的流行作家的單行本來讀。他的文章的內容，可以給我啓發。而單單他能够出版這樣一本書，也能激起我的好勝心，在這一激之下，文章反而被逼出來了。</p>
<p>也有人說，文章寫不出的原因，在於找不到適當的題材。這却須隨時留意。我經常在一本小簿子上，將擬寫的題目錄下。通常只有一二另星的感想，寫起來約五六十字至一二百字，不敷一篇短文的篇幅。這裏，我覺得寫文章彷彿滾雪球，愈滾俞多，等集得相當材料時，一篇文字便產生了。</p>
<p>總之，寫文章雖小道，其原則似可與辦理任何一事相通。年來美國工商業紛紛研究職業訓練，職業關係，職業方法等項目，主持其事者，須留神觀察，隨時紀錄，隨時分析，我想以他們的經驗，必可寫得一手好文章，而除筆者濫竽充數以外，寫得好文章者，亦必觸類旁通，悟解力高人一等也。</p>
<h3>總統與敎會</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>美國的總統們都是和一般的平民一樣，也是信奉基督耶穌的。不過，他們所屬的敎會並不相同；其中以長老會會員最多，先後計有六人，唯一神敎會會員有四人，聖公會會員有兩人，組合敎會，敎友派，基督門徒派和荷蘭改革派各一人。其他的總統則不屬於任何敎會，雖然他們也參加敎堂的禮拜。杜魯門做禮拜的敎堂是華盛頓的「第一浸禮會敎堂」，是一幢有一百四十四年歷史的紅確建築物，離白宮有八條街遠。</p>
<p>在早期，收師對首席執政官的出席，常感到緊張與顧慮。有一個名叫阿員克羅姆比的聖公會收師，每逢聖餐會將要開始的時候，他總是請坐在前排的華盛頓總統走出去。後來，華盛頓爽性在聖餐主日不到敎堂去了。</p>
<p>當林肯競選國會議員而尙未踏進白宮的時期，他曾與美以美敎派的牧師比德·卡賴特鬥過法。卡賴特時常指摘林肯的「無宗敎心的態度。」當競選運動展開之際，卡賴特主持一連串的信仰恢復禮拜，在這樣的一次禮拜中，林肯也出席了，他坐在大廳的後部。卡賴特在佈道的時候，對聽衆們說：「請想要到天國去的人站起來。」大家都站了起來，唯有林肯依然坐着。</p>
<p>卡賴特接下去說：「請想要到地獄去的人站起來。」林肯還是坐着不動。</p>
<p>於是卡賴特宣布道：「除了林肯先生以外，大家都站起來過一次；我們願意知道他希望到甚麽地方去。」</p>
<p>林肯站了起來，安然的說：「我要到國會裏去。」說完，他就走了。</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>有許多久遠以前的事情，還像是昨天的，但是，有些眞是昨天的事，已經如同隔開一百年了。</p>
<p>在沙漠裏，一滴水勝似一粒珍珠。在沒有友誼的心的沙漠裏，一個點頭，或是半個微笑，也强似多少句巧語的恭維，如雷的彩聲……</p>
<p>眞正慈悲的人給人的是「同情」，慈善家則僅僅施捨「憐憫」。</p>
<p>有種人好得討厭，還有種人壞得可愛。—大多數的人密願歡喜後者，而不喜前者。—人心不古到這步田地，鳴呼。</p>
<p>剛懂事的時候，大人敎他的孩子「誠實」；一且孩子長大入世了，再敎他學習「虛偽」。</p>
<h3>天下第一狠毒女子</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>一九〇一年間，美國印第安那州拉巴特地方，搬來了一個名呌貝爾·耿奈斯的孀婦。她在報章雜誌刋登了不少徵婚廣吿，說是願意嫁一個性格溫和而能代她付一筆押款的男子。事實上耿奈斯那一年巳經四十二歲，但是居然應徵而來的男子倒源源不絕，那些勇人到達了她的孤寂的田莊後，她總是先請他們把付押款的錢拿出來，一等錢到手，她立刻就把那個男人害死，偷偷葬掉。一連七年之中，死在她手裏的男人竟達四十餘名之多！她從這四士幾個男人手裏騙到的錢，總額在十萬美元以上。</p>
<p>到一九〇八年時，當地的區長終於動了疑心，想仔細偵查那個孀婦的行動，不想她巳經先得了風聲，她放了一把火把她的田莊燒掉，遠走高飛，竟然給她逃出了法網。</p>
<h3>苓</h3>
<p>國大會塲之一嘘」，造成有「噓」以來之特別紀錄。一位男代表曰：「我亦是贊成的，何必噓我！」一位女代表曰：「等我把話說完了再噓！」且於「噓！噓！」一片之中，鎭定而畢其詞焉。又一女代表曰：「女代表係代表諸君的太太發言，請勿給藐視的噓聲」皆絕妙好詞也。因「噓」之無次不「噓」，無人不「噓」，而「反嘘鬥爭」之節目，於以成立。按「噓」聲從前常在電影塲中聞之，於惡人敗行或緊張情節時，發於四座，多屬兒童。至於民初之國會塲上，亦偶有之，甚為表示厭惡之情緒，阻遏之暗示，自無疑義。考之字典，其音同「虛」，其義為「吹也」，又詳解，忌曰吹，緩曰噓。蹙脣曰吹，虛口日噓。故吹噓二字，雖常相聯屬，而名有其解。南北朝時代，梁侯景登太極殿，其衆「吹唇鼓噪而上」，則「吹」以表歡欣，而「噓」以表厭惡，皆人類器官之本能，出於自然。至於俗以托人情說好話為「吹噓吹噓」是為習慣的用語，無異於「宣傳宣傳」矣。</p>

<h3>別字</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>今人每以「織別字」笑人（別字俗又訛作白字），例如某字應作某寫，若誤寫他字，便笑為「寫別字」，某字應讀某音，若誤讀他音，便笑為「讀別吾」，或「讀別字」。實則我國字數旣繁，而一字又有多種寫法，多種讀音，多種意義，雖通人亦難一一盡識，何况常人。</p>
<p>近代名人張君勱氏之「勱」字，本應讀作「邁」，因此字與「勵」字相差無幾，常見有人誤讀作「厲」音。（編者按：余於民國三十五年民社黨初成立之際，曾往愚園路該黨總部訪張先生及徐夢巖先生，不意該處司　者竟亦朗朗然口稱「君勵先生」，為之愕然。）「矛盾」二字，已成今人口頭禪，盾字應讀作「犉」上聲，或讀作「允」（見字典），但有多人，讀作「豚」上聲，因春秋時，晋大夫趙盾之「盾」字，本讀作「豚」上聲，且同是一字，故不求甚解，隨便讀之。按「矛盾」二字之來歷，係出韓非子「以子之矛，陷子之盾」，此「盾」字本不能與晋大夫趙盾之「盾」，同讀一音，因讀韓非子者較少，讀左傳者較多，尤其讀舊小說「列國志」者更多，以致誤將讀音混而為一。又宏興藥房出售之「鶴鴣菜」，知讀為「柘」者固多，但亦有人誤讀為「庶」。數月前，有電影名「甦鳳記」，甦應讀作「蘇」，但亦有人讀作「生」。此則是「秀才不識字，單續半邊文」矣。爰將別字之可笑者數事，分記如次：</p>
<p>某世家式微，其後人欲將先人所藏宋明諸窑之磁器出售，乃張廣吿於門前，然識字無多，「窑」字竟誤寫為「淫」。其廣吿之文，為「出賣古淫器，几明淫，定淫，宣淫，哥淫，汝淫，無不俱備」云云，見奢大笑。</p>
<p>民初軍閥姜桂題，本不識字，赴熱河任都統，到任之日，大為快樂，謂見沿街店肆，多將「桂題」二字，製牌高掛，以表歡迎，聞者莫明其妙，乃至街肆細察，始恍然大悟，所謂「桂題」之牌，乃麵肆中之市招「挂麵」二字也。</p>
<p>淸代滿員剛毅，為刑部尙書，以舜時臯陶自比，而陶字誤讀成陶淵明之陶。每據報獄囚　斃者，「　」字輒提筆改為「瘦」。四川奏報追剿番夷　中，有「追奔逐北」一語，剛毅認為係「追奔逐比」之訛，謂是指追比番夷掠奪之物云。</p>
<p>曹錕被囚時，好為人作書，而署名常稱「渤叟」，蓋曹係天津西沽人，西沽為渤海之濱也。有一次不知何故，竟將『渤』字之水旁，誤書於「叟」字之左，成為「勃溲」，謯者乃引「牛溲馬勃」成語，以非笑之。</p>

<h3>A New Page in Democratic Politics: Mr. Chiang Kai-shek Elected President - Celebrations with Lanterns and Colored Decorations Across the Country</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] The first President of the Republic of China was elected at 12:50 PM on the 19th during the Presidential Election Assembly of the National Assembly. Chiang Kai-shek received the largest majority of votes and was honorably elected as the first truly democratically elected President in Chinese history. His vote count was 2,430, accounting for 90% of the total 2,734 votes cast, excluding 35 invalid votes. The other candidate, Ju Zheng, also received 269 votes. When the election result was announced at the assembly, the entire venue erupted in cheers and applause, with everyone standing and shouting "Long Live the Republic of China" three times. The fervent atmosphere symbolized the people's unanimous support for the current Chairman Chiang, and the beginning of China's democratic politics has thus laid a good foundation. The Presidential Election Assembly began at 9:25 AM. 2,734 representatives attended, with Zhou Zhongyue presiding. Secretary-General Hong Guanyou read the presidium's report, drew lots to determine the vote supervisors and ballot counting supervisors, and explained the voting and ballot counting methods. The entire venue had four ballot writing areas and four voting areas. A zoned, sequential ticket distribution and voting method was adopted, proceeding in an orderly line. Therefore, the process was swift and orderly. At 9:50 AM, the announcement to start collecting ballots was made, and the supervisors took the stage to examine the ballots. Zoned voting began at 10:17 AM. The first person to cast their ballot was Yu Youren, followed by sequential voting. All 2,734 votes were cast within one hour and five minutes, and the entire voting process was completed by 11:22 AM. After voting, the representatives went to the lounge to exchange their attendance certificates. The assembly resumed at 11:30 AM and began counting ballots. The diplomatic corps, including Ambassador Stuart, who had arrived early to observe, were originally seated in the foreign guest area but moved to the front two rows under the podium as the ballot counting was about to begin. At that time, the twelve ballot boxes were gathered together, flanked by publicly displayed vote counts for the two presidential candidates, "Chiang Kai-shek" and "Ju Zheng," decorated extremely beautifully with lighting, creating a dazzling display that was highly praised by the entire venue. At 11:46 AM, the ballot counters, under the supervision of the supervisors, publicly opened the ballot boxes, completing the process by 12:05 PM. Subsequently, they went through the procedures of tallying, verifying, and counting the votes. At 12:40 PM, Hong Lanyou announced the number of votes cast and the number of invalid votes, and the election result was solemnly announced by the assembly chairman at 12:50 PM. At the same time, the lights on the vote counter were lit up, and the vote counts were also announced on the vote counter. The entire venue erupted in cheers. Then, led by the chairman, all the representatives stood up and cheered "Long Live the Republic of China" three times before adjourning the meeting. (See the diagram below for the vote counts announced by the vote counter)</p>
<p>[Our Report] The news of Chiang Kai-shek's honorable election as the first President spread, and the whole country rejoiced. Our newspaper received special dispatches from Shenyang, Beiping, Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, Wuhu, Nanchang, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Kunming, Chongqing, Hankou, Changsha, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Taipei, Haikou, and other places, reporting that each of these locations received the above news yesterday afternoon. Local newspapers immediately published extra editions, and local merchants and residents voluntarily hung lanterns and colored decorations and raised national flags to celebrate. The sound of firecrackers continued incessantly, resembling the New Year celebrations. Guangzhou even held a celebratory parade. Overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong held joint celebrations last night.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador's Talk with Our Reporter: The Bright Future of Our Democracy - President Chiang's Election as the First President After the Implementation of the Constitution Further Demonstrates That He Is a Leader Beloved by the Entire Nation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] Ambassador Stuart witnessed the entire process of the presidential election from beginning to end at the National Assembly on the 19th. After learning that Chairman Chiang was elected as the first President of our country after the implementation of the Constitution, he said to our reporter with a smile: The future of China's democratic politics is extremely optimistic. With such a large number of people in the venue, the order was excellent, and the voting was absolutely secret and free, truly a bright symbol of democracy. Chairman Chiang's election as President with an absolute majority of votes further demonstrates that he is a leader jointly loved and respected by the entire nation. The representatives of the Chinese people have exercised their sacred duties in accordance with the Constitution, carefully selecting a head of state who is fully capable of fulfilling the heavy responsibilities. China's history will also begin anew from this point forward.</p>
<h3>Ju Zheng Sends a Special Telegram of Congratulations: Chairman Elected President</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, yesterday sent a telegram congratulating Chairman Chiang on his election as the first President, stating: "To His Excellency Chiang, the President of Nanjing: I have just heard on the radio that you have been elected as the first President with the largest majority. The public sentiment is perfectly in accord, and the expectations of the people are fulfilled. The whole country is united, and the entire nation applauds. I respectfully send this telegram of congratulations and wish you peace and prosperity. Ju Zheng, Mao Hao."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After Chairman Chiang was elected President, President Yu Youren of the Control Yuan issued the following statement: "Chairman Chiang assisted Dr. Sun Yat-sen in leading the revolution. After eight years of arduous resistance, we finally achieved final victory. His contributions to the nation are immense, and his reputation is known throughout the world. At a time when the domestic and international situation is causing universal unease, the nationwide people's expectation of Chairman Chiang to assume the presidency carries the most significant and far-reaching meaning, for what the people expect is the implementation of the Constitution, the stability of China, and the safeguarding of world peace. No one other than Chairman Chiang can accomplish this task satisfactorily. As the ancients said, 'It is difficult to find the right person for the world.' Today, Chairman Chiang's honorable election as President is truly 'a celebration of finding the right person for the world.' What we expect from Mr. Chiang is that after he takes office as President, a new democratic China will emerge. To promote the establishment of this new democratic China, I, as a representative of the National Assembly, feel extremely fortunate to have cast this sacred vote for Mr. Chiang. I only hope that under the leadership of the new President, we will implement comprehensive reforms, promote and enhance the revolutionary spirit and fighting power of the Kuomintang over the past fifty years, so that every corner of the country (especially the border regions) and every level of society (especially women) can receive a balanced opportunity for political, economic, and cultural development, eliminating the past malpractices of undue emphasis on some aspects while neglecting others. In particular, we must sincerely unite and thoroughly cooperate with friendly parties to strive to build a new China that is of the people, by the people, and for the people."</p>

<h3>National Assembly Proposal: Continued Review Today</h3>
<p>Fourteenth Assembly Adjourned</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] The seven review committees of the National Assembly are scheduled to convene separately at 9:00 AM on the 20th to review proposals. Currently, there are nearly 700 proposals awaiting review, so meetings will be held both in the morning and afternoon. The 14th Assembly was originally scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on the 19th, but due to insufficient attendance at that time, Chairman Feng Youzhen announced an extension of time twice, but the meeting still could not be convened. It was not until around 4:00 PM that the adjournment was announced. The only item on the agenda for the 14th meeting was the government's response to various reviews. In fact, the responses from various departments have already been printed and distributed in written form, so the government's response will no longer take up assembly time.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Announces This Morning: Vice Presidential Candidates - Verification of Signed Nomination Forms Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] The National Assembly will announce the list of candidates for the first Vice President of the Republic of China on the morning of the 20th in accordance with the law. The list includes six individuals: Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Chuanlin. The announcement reads: "In accordance with Article 5 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, applying mutatis mutandis the provisions of Paragraph 1, Item 1 of Article 4 of the same law, the list of Vice Presidential candidates is hereby published, and in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the same article, the publication shall be based on the number of representatives who jointly nominated them, in order of precedence. The Presidium of the National Assembly convened a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 19th and appointed more than ten people, including Gu Yuxiu, Liu Shiyi, Du Yuming, and Su Ting, to verify the signed nomination forms. The verification of the signed nomination forms of each candidate was completed at 2:00 AM on the 20th. The most nominations were for Sun Ke as a Vice Presidential candidate, totaling more than 500 votes, followed by Yu Youren, more than 500 votes, Li Zongren, more than 400 votes, Cheng Qian, more than 300 votes, Mo Dehui, more than 200 votes, and Xu Chuanlin, more than 100 votes. Among them, a total of 884 votes were discarded due to duplicate endorsements, with Sun Ke losing 250 votes, Yu Youren 236 votes, Li Zongren 193 votes, Cheng Qian 132 votes, Mo Dehui 55 votes, and Xu Chuanlin 18 votes."</p>
<h3>Measures to Resolve Election Disputes - Awaiting Completion of Legislative Procedures - Representatives Who Signed Nomination Forms Must Write Letters of Resignation After Receiving Certificates</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] The Executive Yuan held a "Discussion Meeting on Resolving Election Disputes" at 5:00 PM on the 19th, presided over by Wu Dingchang, to discuss the six measures proposed by Yu Bin, Wang Yunwu, and others to resolve the disputes over signing as National Assembly representatives. More than 20 people, including Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu, attended and exchanged views for three hours. Several concrete measures have been decided regarding the resolution of the signing representative issue, but they must still be passed by the State Council and complete legislative procedures before they can be implemented. The most important ones are: (1) Representatives who signed nomination forms and received more votes can be issued certificates of election, but upon receiving the certificate of election, they must simultaneously write a letter of resignation, ceding their position to the friendly party's candidate whom they nominated; (2) After the representatives who signed nomination forms receive the election certificate and resign, if they wish to attend the National Assembly as observers, the Civil Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan can consult with the Assembly to allow them to attend; (3) The number of representatives from professional organizations and women's organizations is not explicitly stipulated in the Constitution but is determined by law. To allow representatives who signed nomination forms and those nominated by the Central Government who were not elected to have the opportunity to attend, the number of representatives from women's organizations and professional organizations will be increased by 300. After the State Council passes this measure and completes legislative procedures, elections will be held on another date. Those who are members of the Kuomintang among the representatives who signed nomination forms and were elected are the candidates nominated by the Kuomintang and should be supported by the Kuomintang; (4) The date for the re-elections will be within four to six months after the legislative procedures for increasing the number of representatives are completed; (5) Representatives nominated by the Central Government who received more votes but ceded their position to a friendly party's candidate can also apply the first measure, and the government will issue them a certificate of election; (6) Representatives nominated by the Central Government who were not elected should also be nominated by the Central Government to participate in the re-elections when the legislative procedures for increasing the number of representatives are completed and the supplementary elections are held. It is hoped that the above measures can be submitted for discussion at this week's State Council meeting. Yu Bin has already asked Ma Wenche to convey the contents of his measures to all the representatives who signed nomination forms late at night. The representatives who signed nomination forms believe that the implementation of these measures will still take some time. Although the election certificates can be issued first, they still have to write a letter of resignation, which is not an ideal solution.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Declares Abandonment of Qualification as Elected Legislator</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] According to reliable sources, President Sun Ke recently sent a letter to the Central Party Headquarters, declaring that he would abandon his qualification as a legislator. It is reported that Mr. Sun was nominated by a political party and elected by the city of Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Representatives Who Signed Nomination Forms Admitted to Hospital for Observation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 19th] Seven representatives who went on hunger strike, including Yan Zezi, Yang Qiaoxin, and Zhou You, were transferred from the Fifth Guest House to the Central Hospital at 4:30 PM on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is said that the elected representatives who signed nomination forms are deeply grateful for the efforts of representatives such as Yu Bin and Mo Dehui, as well as the diligent and patient guidance of female doctor Hua Shujun, who went to inject glucose solutions every day. They are willing to be admitted to the hospital for recuperation. It is said that Representative Zhou You was moved to tears by Dr. Hua's kind persuasion. Representative Hua was elected by the free occupational groups, hence the recent nickname of "Goddess of Freedom" at the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Envoys from Four Countries Present Credentials in Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The newly appointed Swedish Ambassador Arne Lundberg, Greek Ambassador Achilles Avraamides, Indian Ambassador Sardar K.M. Panikkar, and Philippine Minister Emilio Quirino, following the order of seniority, visited Chairman Chiang at the National Government this morning from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM to present their credentials.</p>
<h3>Good News from the Central Section of the Longhai Railway: Gongxian, Fanshui, and Xingyang Recovered - National Army in Southwestern Henan Also Continues to Recover Nanzhao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 19th] Gongxian was recovered on the 16th by the troops of Magistrate Run Sheng, who operated behind enemy lines.

<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch on the 19th] The main force of the Liu bandits who fled west of the Pinghan Railway is currently reorganizing in the area of Wuyang northwest, Fangcheng north, and Yexian and Lushan north of Fangcheng. In addition, the Zhang Zhen Corps of the National Army is advancing in two routes to the west of the railway to eliminate the remnants of the bandits in the Tongbai and Dahongshan areas.

Also, the railway between Queshan and Zhumadian that was damaged by the bandits has been repaired by two-thirds after continuous repairs and is expected to resume traffic in about three days.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 19th] More than 2,000 bandits who secretly crossed the Lu River Estuary southwest of Xunyang were completely annihilated yesterday, but the bandits in Baihe continued to move towards Xunyang. The situation is tense on both sides of the Jing River basin near Guyi in the old guerrilla area in northern Shaanxi. Passenger buses on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway were suspended on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 19th] The Third Air Force Command announced at 6:00 PM on the 19th: The weather improved today, and the Air Force based here continuously attacked the bandits fleeing west on both sides of the Jing River from dawn to dusk, repeatedly strafing at low altitude, killing more than 500 bandits. On the same day, another group of aircraft flew to Linfen and heavily bombed the bandit positions in Chengdongguan and northeast of the city, destroying more than ten bandit artillery positions and bunkers, killing more than 100 bandits.</p>
<h3>A Brief Biography of Chiang Kai-shek, First President of Our Nation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] A brief biography of President Chiang Kai-shek, the first president of the Republic of China:</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek, named Zhongzheng, styled Jieshi, was born in Xikou Township, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, on October 31st, twenty-five years before the founding of the Republic of China. He is now sixty-two years old. His ancestors were farmers and scholars who did not seek official positions. His grandfather, Wang Biao, and his uncle, Ni Su'an, were both known for their virtuous conduct. His mother, Madam Wang, was virtuous, intelligent, and far-sighted. When the President was eight or nine years old, he suffered the loss of both his grandfather and father in quick succession, and his family fortune declined. Madam Wang personally taught him and supervised his studies strictly, but also cared for him with utmost concern, hoping for his great future. At the age of seventeen, the President entered the Fenghua Fenglu Academy. The following year, he studied with Mr. Gu Qinglian in Yin County, who praised and encouraged him greatly for his exceptional talent. He studied the works of the philosophers of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, as well as the collected works of Zeng Guofan, and also practiced Sun Tzu's strategies, striving to become a match for ten thousand enemies. Later, the President often said that his knowledge of Chinese academic sources and his understanding of reading methods all came from Mr. Gu's teachings.</p>
<p>The President's lifelong learning and achievements, as well as his virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, were all rooted in his excellent family and early childhood education. At the age of nineteen, he studied at the Longjin Middle School in the county. At that time, during the Sino-Japanese War, the President was deeply saddened by the country's daily decline and the internal and external pressures. His ambition to save the country and its people deepened with age, and he vowed to study military science abroad. He then went to Japan, but because he was not recommended by the domestic Ministry of the Army, he entered the Qinghua School. In Tokyo that year, he met Mr. Chen Qimei and made many revolutionary friends, marking the beginning of his dedication to the revolutionary cause. He returned to China in the winter, and the following year, he passed the entrance examination for the Baoding Military Academy and was selected to study in Japan as a military student. He then went to Japan again. It was five years before the founding of the Republic of China, and the President was one year old [in the Chinese way of counting age]. He entered the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko (Military Preparatory School), where he joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) through the introduction of Mr. Chen Qimei, further connecting with comrades to serve the revolution. Two years later, he graduated and entered the 13th Field Artillery Regiment of the Japanese Takada, serving as a non-commissioned officer. Life in the camp was extremely strict, with morning exercises, grooming horses, and evening polishing of boots, enduring hardship and labor, and strengthening his physical body. He believed that he owed much of his lifelong learning and career to this experience. Two years later, as the opportunity for the Xinhai Revolution became increasingly ripe, the President returned to China from Japan that summer and secretly planned with Mr. Chen Qimei in Shanghai to launch uprisings in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In August, he returned to the regiment, but within a month, he received news of the Wuchang Uprising. He disguised himself, went to Nagasaki, boarded a ship back to China, and took charge of the Zhejiang affairs. He went to Hangzhou to mobilize the new army and recruit dare-to-die squads for the uprising. On September 13th, Shanghai declared independence. The following night at two o'clock, Hangzhou responded. The dare-to-die squads were the first to attack, destroying the Governor's office and capturing Qing officials. After Zhejiang Province was taken, he returned to Shanghai to assist Mr. Qimei in planning the entire Jiangsu Province, personally training an infantry regiment and serving as its commander, which was the 5th Regiment of the Shanghai Army. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai seized power, destroyed the constitution, and suppressed the revolution. The President followed Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai, assisting Mr. Qimei in the revolution and participating in the Fourth Anti-Yuan Campaign. The uprising of the Zhaohe gunboat was particularly effective in demonstrating the power of the revolution and frightening the warlords. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen went south to protect the constitution. The President stayed in Shanghai, assessed the state of affairs, and advocated for the Northern Expedition. He repeatedly wrote to Sun Yat-sen, presenting his strategies for governing the country. Over the next four years, his plans were insightful and accurate, and his assistance in military affairs was often ingenious. In May of the tenth year, Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of President. The President formulated strategies for stabilizing Anhui and Guangxi. In June, his mother, Madam Wang, passed away. The President was deeply saddened and observed mourning at home, often saying that the way to repay his virtuous mother was to dedicate himself to the revolution and the party-state. In the spring of the eleventh year, he was summoned to Guilin. In May, he accompanied Sun Yat-sen in Shaoguan to swear an oath for the Northern Expedition, but suddenly faced the Chen Jiongming Incident. The President rushed from Shanghai to Guilin to assist, serving Sun Yat-sen on the Yongfeng warship, taking on difficult and dangerous tasks, and gaining further recognition and trust from Sun Yat-sen. In the twelfth year, he was sent to Russia by Sun Yat-sen to report and conduct investigations, paying attention to the country's revolutionary and nation-building path. In June of the thirteenth year, the Military Academy was established in Whampoa. The President was appointed as the principal, personally handling all matters, both large and small, to cultivate revolutionary military cadres and lay the foundation for the Northern Expedition. In March of the fourteenth year, Sun Yat-sen passed away. The President mourned the passing of the revolution's leader and felt the heavy burden of continuing the revolutionary cause. In July of the fifteenth year, he assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, leading his troops on the Northern Expedition, directly advancing through the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Wherever the army went, the people felt as if they were being rescued from a dire situation. Within half a year, the southeast was stabilized. In April of the sixteenth year, the National Government was established in Nanjing. The President, feeling that his long-cherished wish had been partially fulfilled, retired after achieving success. In the same year, he went to Japan and then returned to China. Afterwards, he married Miss Soong Mei-ling in Shanghai. At that time, the remnants of the Northern warlords were occupying territories, and Japan was obstructing the Northern Expedition. The President was ordered by the Central Government to lead the troops again and continue the Northern Expedition, attacking Beijing and Tianjin. The Northeast changed its flag, and the great task of unification was completed. In the seventeenth and twentieth years, he twice served as Chairman of the National Government. At that time, the conflicts in the south and the central plains caused the revolution to repeatedly face crises. The President calmly faced the situation, and ultimately turned the country's fortunes from danger to safety. After the September 18th Incident, the President knew that national defense was not strong and exercised patience and prudence, resigning from his position to gain understanding. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the President responded to the nationwide expectation and assumed the position of Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, enduring humiliation and bearing a heavy burden, and dealing with the enemy. After that, he worked hard to govern the country, build national defense, and actively prepare for resisting foreign aggression and strengthening the country. In the twenty-third year, he promoted the New Life Movement to change social customs. The following year, he promoted national economic construction to benefit the people's livelihood. In October of the twenty-fifth year, on the President's fiftieth birthday, people at home and abroad offered airplanes as birthday gifts. The President published an article, "Serving the Country and Remembering One's Parents," using a review of his personal experiences to encourage compatriots to jointly dedicate themselves to serving the country, which was deeply moving. However, not long after, the Xi'an Incident occurred, and the President was held captive for two weeks. With his upright character and influence, he finally made the rebellious generals submit, and he returned to Nanjing safely.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year, when the July 7th Incident occurred, the President, realizing that the final moment had arrived, led the nation to rise up and resist the war. The following year, in March, the Provisional National Congress of the Kuomintang was held in Hankou, and he was elected as Director-General. In the same year, he founded the Three Principles of the People Youth League and personally served as its leader. In the twenty-eighth year, he was elected as Chairman of the National Defense Supreme Committee and concurrently served as President of the Executive Yuan. After that, he commanded and planned, working diligently day and night, and was finally able to suppress the enemy's fierce flames and bring the country's fortunes to revival.</p>
<p>After the Pacific War, the President's outstanding insight and great achievements were increasingly admired by friendly nations, both in government and among the people. In February of the thirty-first year, he visited India. During the National Day of that year, the United Kingdom and the United States announced the abolition of unequal treaties. The following year, in January, new treaties between China and the United Kingdom and the United States were established, and the century-old shackles were finally lifted. The President further telegraphed to encourage compatriots, showing them that this was not easy to achieve and urging them to work hard in the future. In September of that year, the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee elected him as Chairman of the National Government. On October 10th, he solemnly took office amidst the unanimous support of the military and civilians of the country. On November 12th, he met with President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in Cairo to discuss military and political strategies in the Pacific theater and decided on the plan for the reconstruction of East Asia. The following year, the Four-Nation Declaration was signed, which further enhanced the righteousness of China's war of resistance and strengthened the cooperation of the Allied nations. After Germany and Italy were defeated, the Japanese army lost courage. In August of the thirty-fourth year, Japan was defeated and exhausted, declaring unconditional surrender. The great and arduous war of resistance that had lasted for eight years was finally concluded victoriously.</p>
<p>In May of the thirty-fifth year, the National Government triumphantly returned to the capital. The President led civil and military officials to pay tribute to the spirit of Sun Yat-sen and was warmly supported by compatriots throughout the country. On November 15th, the National Government convened the National Assembly. The Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social elites without party affiliation jointly formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, which was promulgated on January 1st of the thirty-sixth year and implemented on December 25th of the same year, realizing the long-cherished wish of returning power to the people and establishing a solid foundation for the Republic of China for centuries to come.</p>
<p>The President's greatness lies in his ordinariness. His daily life is no different from ordinary people, but it is even simpler and more frugal than most. The President advocates the New Life Movement and is also a practitioner of it. He has a very strict and disciplined life, valuing time more than money and valuing spirit more than matter. He does not smoke or drink. His meals are extremely simple. Even when hosting guests, he does not prepare delicacies, only four dishes and one soup. His clothing is also only clean and tidy, not luxurious. In the past ten years, he has worn military uniforms for two-thirds of the time, with only three or four sets to change regularly. He wears casual clothes at home, and the materials he chooses are all domestic products. His residence is like that of ordinary civilians. When traveling or staying elsewhere, he travels light with a small entourage. Even if the environment is messy, he can still handle it with composure. He gets up early every morning, sits quietly for a while, and then begins his busy day of work, which always lasts more than fourteen hours. The President is dedicated to his work, possesses leadership talent, and has a spirit of adventure and struggle, pursuing truth, working hard and tirelessly, and constantly striving for self-improvement, which is why he has been able to achieve his great career.</p>
<p>The President's great achievements in his life, in addition to benefiting from the education of his virtuous mother and good teachers in his youth, are also greatly influenced by Madame Chiang. In the twenty-third year, Madame Chiang assisted the President in launching the New Life Movement to improve the people's knowledge, morality, and living habits, which was an important social movement led by the President for revolution and nation-building. In the twenty-fifth year, when the President was held captive in Xi'an, Madame Chiang resolutely went to the rescue, sharing his safety and danger. During the war, she not only devoted herself to the sacred work of rescue, healing, and childcare, but also accompanied the President on visits to India, participated in the Cairo Conference, and visited the United States, working hard on foreign publicity, which was admired by the world.</p>
<p>The President has followed Sun Yat-sen in devoting himself to the revolution, always with the goal of building China into an independent, free, unified, and democratic country as his lifelong ambition. For decades, the President and China have been an inseparable part of history. During that time, the country faced difficulties, and the President bore them all on his shoulders, awakening the national spirit, gathering national strength, and striving for the country's destiny. The hardships were unprecedented, and the achievements were unmatched by any era in national history. When the country's fortunes were at their most pessimistic, the President alone remained steadfast. When the public was most confused, the President alone had his own views. When everyone was surrendering to the environment, the President alone upheld his fearless spirit, knowing that it was impossible but doing it anyway. All these examples can be seen in the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. If it were not for the President's strong and great character to guide us, it is highly doubtful whether our Chinese nation could have survived thousands of hardships and dangers without falling in recent decades. Looking back, the President has used his outstanding military genius to complete the great achievements of the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. He has also used his outstanding diplomatic and political talents to befriend strong neighbors, resolve internal political grievances, and lead the country towards the path of unity and democracy. Therefore, China cannot be without a President, and looking to the future, China cannot be without a President for even a day. At this time, when suppressing rebellion, saving the country, and implementing the constitution have just begun, we must rely on the wise, unwavering, and universally admired President to continue his leadership in order to lay the foundation for the country's permanent peace and unity. The prosperity and decline of our country and the survival of our nation all depend on the President alone.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Bright Future of Democratic Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>——Congratulating Chairman Chiang on Being Elected First President</p>
<p>The National Assembly elected the first President of the Republic of China yesterday morning at 10 a.m. and solemnly counted the ballots on the spot. As we expected, our nation’s supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek received 2,430 votes and was elected, accounting for nearly 90% of the total number of delegates present. This is not only an epoch-making initiative in our country’s politics, but also the most glorious page in our history. Therefore, as soon as the news of Chairman Chiang’s election as President spread, people from all walks of life in the capital, upon hearing the good news, competed to set off firecrackers to celebrate. The enthusiastic situation was no less than when the good news of the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan was received three years ago. In Shanghai, all newspapers published extra editions. The red news reports were sold out, and citizens were extremely excited. All factories, businesses, schools, and public organizations will automatically hang flags today to celebrate. At this time of bright spring sunshine, the sight of the colorful national flags waving in the streets is enough to symbolize the bright and brilliant future of our country’s democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>The nationwide celebration of Chiang Kai-shek’s election as President is enough to show the sincere support of the people for Chiang Kai-shek. However, we must not always immerse ourselves in self-intoxication, only knowing how to praise and feel self-satisfied. We should maintain a considerable degree of calmness in our enthusiasm. On the one hand, we should think more about the future of the country. On the other hand, we should deeply reflect on how to fulfill the responsibilities of the people of a democratic country for politics. Therefore, we would like to take the opportunity of the nationwide celebration of Chiang Kai-shek’s election as President to express our hopes for the future new government.</p>
<p>First, the election of Chiang Kai-shek as the first President by this National Assembly has not only completed its historical mission, but has also brought Chinese politics into another new stage. Since Chiang Kai-shek led his troops on the Northern Expedition, he first overthrew the warlords who dared to engage in civil wars, completing the unification of the Republic of China. After that, he resisted foreign aggression, and after eight years of arduous struggle, he defeated our strong enemy, the Japanese invaders, and abandoned all unequal treaties. The goal of nationalism can be said to have been fully realized. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, he actively promoted democratic constitutionalism, regardless of the obstruction and sabotage of the Communist bandits, fully demonstrating the spirit of doing his best. Two years ago, he convened the National Assembly to formulate a democratic constitution. This year, he convened the National Assembly to elect a President, following the constitutional procedures and gradually embarking on the path of true democratic constitutionalism. As far as the principle of people’s rights is concerned, it can be said that more than half has been implemented. However, looking at the Three Principles of the People advocated by Sun Yat-sen, only the principle of people’s livelihood has not been implemented. Looking at the domestic situation, because of the enemy’s invasion and destruction, the vitality has not yet recovered. The Communist bandits followed closely, attempting to expand their territory by force, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, destroying domestic transportation everywhere, and destroying the people’s production, so that the people could not live, the society was turbulent, and even the country’s lifeline was in a state of dying. Therefore, we believe that the most urgent problem in our country at present is to stabilize the people’s livelihood. As long as we implement Sun Yat-sen’s principle of people’s livelihood, we can not only save the people from deep water and fire, but also be the only best way to win back the hearts of the people. How should our country’s industry be industrialized? How should our country’s land be reformed? These are all the urgent tasks of the constitutional government and the focus of our people’s hopes for governance.</p>
<p>Second, Chiang Kai-shek is the first person in the country who is loyal to the constitution and loyal to its implementation. Now that he has been elected as the first President, he will naturally abide by the constitution and will execute the President’s basic tasks in accordance with the constitutional procedures. At present, the people of the whole country are watching to see whom he will recommend to the Legislative Yuan to be the President of the Executive Yuan. We also feel that the choice of the first President of the Executive Yuan of the constitutional government is also very important, and it is a key to cultivating a new democratic political style. The incompetence and corruption of the past government have been known to China and foreign countries, and there is no need to conceal them. Therefore, we hope that the future new government can eliminate corruption by establishing a civil service system and improving the treatment of civil servants, and improve administrative efficiency by selecting and employing the competent. From then on, the government can not only have a new look, but also truly start anew with the people.</p>
<p>In short, Chairman Chiang’s election as President is the first step for our country’s politics to embark on democratic constitutionalism, but it brings us unlimited new hope. The above two items are just the starting point of political reform. We hope that the new constitutional government will soon use facts to satisfy our wishes and open up a bright future for our country’s democratic constitutionalism!</p>
<h3>The Financial Crisis in This City</h3>
<p>Due to the separate reorganization of various taxes in our city, the income has gradually improved, and the income and expenditures can be offset. During the peak collection period, the city treasury also had a considerable surplus. Monthly expenditures can be allocated according to the budget, and there has never been any news of overdue salaries or payments. In a time of financial difficulties and widespread poverty, this must be considered a barely satisfactory matter.</p>
<p>However, the situation afterwards does not seem as smooth as in the past. According to the Finance Bureau, the total amount of salaries for government employees in March was 130 billion yuan. After the adjustment of treatment, it will increase to more than 300 billion yuan, and the total income of the city’s finances is only 322.5 billion yuan. Then the amount of daily income is at most enough to pay salaries, and other business expenses are completely unavailable. Moreover, the salaries of public educators will be adjusted monthly in the future. According to the current trend, there is no sign that the price increase will stop, then the difference between income and expenditure will inevitably become more and more distant. If this continues, indeed, as Director Tian said: the future of local finances is not optimistic.</p>
<p>That being said, public finance is different from private finance after all. No matter how difficult it is, we must try our best to find ways to deal with it. Therefore, how to overcome this difficulty and how to deal with this situation is not only a major issue for the city’s financial authorities, but also a matter that every citizen should be concerned about.</p>
<p>According to normal theory, all solutions to the problem of financial imbalance must follow two old paths, namely, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Among the ways to increase revenue, in addition to the path of price increase that is not feasible now, there are only two ways to increase new taxes and reorganize old taxes. Whether these two paths are feasible and whether the general public still has the ability to bear the burden is not considered for the time being. In fact, it will inevitably take a long time and many efforts to gradually achieve it. Therefore, relying solely on these two paths to cope with the ever-increasing deficit is at least a question in terms of technology.</p>
<p>The expenditure on employee salaries used to account for nearly 40% of the total expenditure, and now it will account for the entirety of the total expenditure, or even exceed this total. Then, the old tune of reducing personnel seems to have to be replayed. However, as far as we can see, all departments are calling for insufficient manpower due to being too busy, so the new establishment of the city government approved by the Executive Yuan cannot be considered difficult to implement, and we must ask for changes again. Moreover, due to the holding of new businesses or coping with the new environment, there are still many institutions that are constantly being added outside of this new establishment. Therefore, to take the path of reducing expenditure, it is useless to talk about reducing staff alone. We must consider slowing down the new businesses or temporarily suspending the unimportant businesses, which is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>However, the importance of businesses often varies in its assessment due to different subjectivity. There are many businesses that are considered secondary or even wasteful by the general public, but to the主管 or stakeholders, all are justified. Therefore, this path cannot be taken either. Therefore, the future of the city’s finances is not optimistic.</p>

<h3>Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun Fly to Taiyuan Together, Visit Yan Xishan for a Long Talk, and Thoroughly Review Military Affairs. Will They Return to Beiping by the Original Plane? National Army in Southern Hebei Recaptures Dongming, and Continues to Pursue and Suppress Communist Bandits in Eastern Hebei.</h3>
<p>[Beiping News, 19th] Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun flew to Taiyuan together at 8 a.m. this morning for a “Visit in the Style of Return to Ning," and will return to Beiping that night. Observers say: The meeting between Fu, Yan, and Chu to broadly review the overall situation in North China in terms of military and political strategies for bandit suppression is inevitable. However, it is too early to say that the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters will take joint action.</p>
<p>[Beiping News, 19th] Dongming in Southern Hebei was recovered by local militia on the 12th. There was a fierce battle in Wuqing, near the Pingjin Line. More than 2,000 Communist bandits occupied Hexiwu on the Pingjin Highway yesterday. They are now in fierce battle with the Wuqing garrison near the city.</p>
<p>[Baoding News, 19th] The National Army that recovered Anxin in Central Hebei continued to circle south on the 19th to pursue and suppress the remnant bandits in the surrounding areas of Gaoyang, Lixian, and Qingyuan. All the independent battalions of bandits on both sides of the Qingshui River were defeated, and 20 shi of bandit military rations and dozens of war horses were captured. They are still being encircled and suppressed in separate routes.</p>
<p>[Guihua News, 18th] Communist bandits who attacked Dongsheng were defeated by the local militia and fled back to Ernuanshui in Jungar Banner. In addition, the main forces of the 1st and 6th Columns of Nie Rongzhen's troops, in cooperation with the 3rd Independent Brigade of the Jin-Sui Military Region, attacked Ying County from Weiyuanbao (the border area between Shanxi and Suiyuan, belonging to Shanxi). There has been fierce fighting in the city for several days. The garrison is the former unit of Qiao Richun, a People's Hero of Northern Shanxi. Qiao died while defending Ying County in 1946. The city is currently led by Zhang Bo, and a fierce battle is expected to unfold.</p>
<p>[Taiyuan News, 19th] After taking office in their new positions in North China, Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun visited Taiyuan for the first time on the 19th. The special plane arrived in Taiyuan at 10:50 a.m., and the news quickly spread throughout the city. Fu and Chu entered the city after getting off the plane and immediately held a one-hour talk with Yan Xishan. Then Yan hosted a lunch banquet, which was attended by senior Shanxi generals Yang Aiyuan, Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, and others. After the meal, the three continued their talks for three hours, elaborating in detail on the political, economic, and anti-traitor measures in Shanxi. Fu also explained the strategic and tactical methods of bandit suppression. At 5 p.m., Fu and Chu left Taiyuan. Before leaving, Yan gave them local products such as carpets and serge. According to Fu, the Civil Salvation Vanguard, equipped with cavalry, specializes in attacking the rear of the bandits. The National Army that captured Yixian made progress again yesterday. There is no decisive battle on the Ping-Sui Line yet. Local administrative work should be based on the principle of using local cadres, which is more effective. Chu said that the Civil Salvation Vanguard has been established for more than two months, with 1,300 cadres, and 13 teams have been formed. Hebei Province does not separate military and political affairs, but seeks to facilitate bandit suppression, so it is confident in bandit suppression.</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou News, 19th] Zhangjiakou has returned to normal, and traffic on the Pingzhang Line is unimpeded. The Zhangtong section has also begun to continue repairs, and the North Chahar Highway has also been opened to Pingzhangbei and Kangbao counties.

<h3>Detention Center Warden Rapes Female Prisoner, Forces Abortion Almost Leading to Death; Chen Guangcheng Flees in Fear of Punishment After Being Accused</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guangzhou, 19th] Zhanjiang News: A shocking case occurred at the Guangzhou Bay District Court, where a detention center warden was accused of raping a female prisoner, causing her to become pregnant, and then forcing her to have an abortion, almost leading to her death. It is reported that Zheng Xiujin, a newly arrived female prisoner at the detention center, was quite attractive. Chen Guangteng, the detention center warden, took notice of her and took advantage of his power, using "court appearance" as an excuse to take the female prisoner back to his home and force her to have sexual relations. After being raped, the female prisoner attempted suicide several times without success. She recently discovered she was pregnant. Chen, fearing exposure, forcibly performed an abortion, almost causing the female prisoner to die tragically. This incident aroused the public anger of the prisoners, who urged Zheng to file a complaint with the court, providing the stillborn fetus as evidence. However, Chen fled in fear of punishment and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Chronicle: The Choice of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] At noon on April 19, 1948, in Nanjing, the national flags fluttered in the clear sky, reflecting the spring sunlight. Newspaper boys shouted the headlines, racing on the streets, and the breeze carried excited voices, as firecrackers accompanied the broadcast:</p>
<p>"At the presidential election meeting of the First National Assembly this morning, Chiang Kai-shek received 2,430 votes and was elected the first President of the Republic of China." All the people of Nanjing were spreading this heartwarming news, because everyone felt that this was their own choice, just as British Ambassador Sir Stevenson said after learning the election results in the meeting place: "This is the choice of the Chinese people, good!"</p>
<p>The meeting on the 19th was unprecedentedly grand. Almost all the reported delegates attended, and some delegates arrived particularly early. At the beginning of the meeting, a female "delegate" who had been judged by the court to be ineligible to be elected and lost her delegate status made a small fuss. After that, the entire meeting time was filled with joy, replacing the usual shouts, hisses, and laughter. The long table and chairs at the back of the chairman's platform were replaced with a wooden screen, with a total of thirty-six voting booths. The delegate seats on the last row on both sides of the upper floor were also removed, and eighteen voting booths were separated with pink silk screens. Twelve ballot boxes were prepared according to the twelve districts of the seating arrangement upstairs and downstairs. Hong Lanyou spent more than half an hour helping Chairman Zhou Zhongyue report on various precautions for the election, and assigned the inspectors to their posts. Voting began at 11:15. The entire process of issuing ballots, writing ballots, and voting was divided into two halves, starting with the delegates sitting in the front row, who lined up and proceeded in an orderly manner. They received ballots with their delegate certificates, entered the voting booth which was just big enough to hold one person, secretly marked the circles, folded the ballots, and sent them into the ballot box, completing this sacred mission. Hong Lanyou stood in front of the podium, observing in all directions and listening to all sounds, shouting "Please do not sit in the seats of the delegates if you are not a delegate" to the east, and "Please do not block our aisles, photography reporters" to the west. He apologized repeatedly to the delegates sitting in the back row waiting their turns. From 10:37 to 10:38, applause broke out twice in a row in the delegate seats, and the drowsy delegates woke up one by one, their tired eyes dazed by the mercury lights. After a while, they realized that it was the border rose Zuo Erhan and the National Assembly flower Tang Shunjun who had voted one after the other on the left and right sides. The delegates who had voted went to the lounge to rest one after another, and the number of people in the hall and the beads of sweat on Hong Lanyou's forehead gradually decreased.</p>
<p>The reporters who were looking around and bouncing around would not be asked to leave the venue this time. Hong Lanyou said: "Gentlemen reporters, I have fulfilled my promise."</p>
<p>After being busy for more than an hour, the inspectors wearing red-edged purple silk ribbons, and several delegates who were not flexible, also voted under the care of Zhao Junhao, the ballot issuing inspector. Zhou Zhongyue announced the preparation for counting the votes.</p>
<p>The public announcement board for Chiang Kai-shek's votes was placed on the right side of the chairman's platform, and the public announcement board for Ju Zheng's votes was placed on the left. The delegates returned to the venue, and twenty or so observing envoys also came down from the platform and sat in the front row of the chairman's seat. They all smiled and refused to guess the election results. Ambassador Stuart said: "The election is conducted under open attention and good order, it must be very fair." But when asked to guess who would be elected, he smiled and said: "You can guess like me!" Miss Kadimi, the daughter of the Iranian charge d'affaires, was the only female foreign guest. Her beautiful eyes looked at the public announcement board for Ju Zheng's votes, shining with the light of fluorescent lamps. She asked: "Who is Chairman Chiang's competitor?" At this time, Foreign Minister Wang, who participated in the ceremony of the four envoys from Uzbekistan presenting their credentials, also hurried in in formal attire. He said that because Chairman Chiang did not come, he gave up his right to vote.</p>
<p>Applause for Three Consecutive Minutes</p>
<p>The vote counting only took one lens. In the tense atmosphere, Hong Lanyou reported the total number of votes as 2,743 instead of 2,734. Zhou Zhongyue also moved the election forward by ten years, saying: "The Republic of China in its twenty-seventh year, ah no! April 19, thirty-seventh year?..." The result that Chiang Kai-shek received 2,430 votes caused the entire audience to applaud continuously for three minutes. Ju Zheng's 269 votes also received enthusiastic applause for a full minute. At 12:50, after Zhou Zhongyue's trembling and joyful announcement: "Chiang Kai-shek is elected as the first President of the Republic of China," cheers almost broke through the roof of the assembly hall, and the entire audience stood up and shouted "Long live the Republic of China" three times. The excitement of the remaining numbers and the good news, as the meeting dispersed, spread out of the gate of the hall, spread all over Nanjing, and spread all over China. Ambassador Stuart sincerely said: "The history of the Republic of China has begun again from today." This sentence will tell the world to those who care about China. (April 19, Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Preliminary Results of the Italian Election: Government Party Shows Clear Victory; Voter Turnout Nearly 90% of Total</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Own Correspondent] London, 19th - Radio broadcast: Rome report - Semi-official sources state that concerning the results of the Senate elections, reports have been received from 254 constituencies out of Italy's 41,648 constituencies. Among these, the Christian Democratic Party has obtained 70,021 votes, while the Communist Front has secured 48,135 votes. The election results have already been calculated, and the districts include 19 districts in the Rome area, 122 districts in the Milan area, 28 districts in the Bologna area, 1 district in the Venice area, 64 districts in the Turin area, and 20 districts in the Florence area.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 19th] Italy's historic election, lasting a day and a half, concluded at 2 PM on the 19th. Rome Radio reported at 3 PM, "The last vote has been cast into the ballot box. Italy and the world will know the direction of the Italian nation tonight." The crowds in front of polling stations this morning were far less enthusiastic than on Sunday, as 90% of voters had already cast their ballots on Sunday. Officials predict that the number of voters will account for a very large proportion of the total electorate, due to the awakening of the passively-minded middle class. Leaders of the center and right-wing parties therefore anticipate that the final results will show a trend of the public moving away from the People's Front. The general public also expects the Christian Democratic Party to win a significant victory. A very notable phenomenon in this general election is the near absence of violent acts, partly due to the strict security measures of the military police. However, many people are still hesitant to predict what actions the Communist Party will take after failing in the election. Therefore, the whole country is hoping that the national armed forces can prevent any riots from occurring.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 19th] The Ministry of the Interior announced that in each of the 68 provinces of Italy, by 10 PM on the 18th, the number of voters who had voted had reached 69% to 88% of the total number of voters. At the same time, although the final results are still pending formal announcement after voting closed at 2 PM today, it is already rumored in Rome that the Communist Party has suffered a crushing defeat everywhere. In Rome, Genoa, Milan, Brescia, and other places, the Communist Party has suffered setbacks. Only in Turin, a Communist stronghold, does the People's Front hold an advantage. Rome Radio announced at about 1 PM that Prime Minister Gasperi and Communist leader Togliatti would both issue formal declarations on the evening of the 19th. Large crowds have gathered outside newspaper offices to await the unveiling of the final results.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 19th] In the 183 senatorial constituencies of Rome, the initial results of the two counts show that the candidates of the Christian Democratic Party led by Prime Minister Gasperi account for 71%, while the People's Front led by the Communist Party has 15%.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 19th] Officials from the General Election Office began opening ballot boxes in the Rome area at about 2 PM on the 19th, under the supervision of representatives from various parties. The ballot boxes were guarded overnight by military police on the 18th. Officials from the Election Office said that the ballot counting process in the Rome area would continue until 2 AM on the morning of the 20th at the earliest. Semi-official estimates indicate that by noon on the 19th, 25 million people nationwide had voted, representing 87% of the total electorate. Voter turnout in northern provinces was very high, while it was lower in the south. In some cities, only 75% of voters cast their ballots. In the city of Valcona in northern Italy, only three out of 803 voters abstained, setting the highest record for voter turnout. In the province of Piedmont, voter turnout accounted for 95% of the total electorate.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Schuman Expresses Willingness to Cooperate Sincerely with Italy, Plans to Promote Legislation to Implement Military Reform</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] French Prime Minister Schuman delivered a speech in the city of Poitiers today, stating that France's economic situation has improved, but progress is still insufficient. He said that France's imports still exceed exports, and this situation will need to continue for several years before there is hope of having sufficient foreign currency, especially US dollars, to pay for imports. When discussing the international situation, Schuman said that the need for international solidarity is increasing daily, and the solidarity during wartime still retains its value after the war. France will not exclude the friendship of anyone, even those who were enemies of France yesterday, such as Italy, which was separated from free and peaceful countries due to the oppression of its regime. He hopes that the results of this Italian general election will allow democracy to be restored on the Italian peninsula and establish sincere cooperation between France and Italy.</p>
<p>Regarding the German question, he believes that a solution must be formulated based on democratic principles and taking into account security needs. He said that any plan to establish a centralized German government will arouse German ideas of revenge and aggressive imperialism. Schuman also revealed that when the parliament reconvenes, the government will request the passage of laws to implement military reform.</p>
<h3>Marseilles Communists Hold Demonstration, Clash with De Gaulle Supporters</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Marseilles, 18th] 100,000 people gathered at the Old Port to hear a speech by De Gaulle, leader of the "French People's Rally." At the other end of the pier, several thousand people participated in a Communist rally to protest De Gaulle's arrival in Marseilles. Former Minister of Health Billoux and several Communist members of the General Confederation of Labor vehemently criticized De Gaulle's policies, saying that their aim was to establish a personal dictatorship. After the rally, the Communists held a demonstration on the main thoroughfares of Marseilles. The two groups clashed in front of De Gaulle's headquarters, but there were no casualties.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] Communist leader Thorez spoke this afternoon at the Buffalo Stadium in the southern suburbs of Paris, calling on French socialists and Catholic citizens to join the Communist Party and fight together for freedom. Thorez then attacked the Marshall Plan, saying that De Gaulle had praised it as a "way out" of the impasse. "We ask, what is this way out?" The answer is to provoke war against the Soviet Union and the new people's democracies.</p>
<h3>Pope Expresses Concern About the Italian Election Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 19th] The Pope in the Vatican Palace receives hourly reports on the progress of the Italian general election.

The Pope told friends that he was pleased with the orderly nature of the voting.</p>
<h3>Italian Communist Leader Says Opposition Between Left and Right Groups Will Lead to Disastrous Consequences</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 18th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti predicted that if the Communist Party is not allowed to participate in the government, Italy will experience unrest. In an article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, Unità, he wrote, "At the end of the election campaign, I called for the unity of democratic forces because I know that without this unity, our country will face unpleasant days. We are currently threatened with the re-establishment of a reactionary regime, and even the danger of a resurgence of fascism. We are also in danger of being dragged into a military bloc that questions military matters, thus causing war or becoming an imperialist war base. In addition, there is the threat that social conflicts will intensify due to the failure to realize social reforms in the constitution. In short, the permanent division of the main political forces into opposing groups will make the threat more serious and lead to tragic results.</p>
<h3>Will the Anti-Communist Motion Be Passed? The Pan-American Conference Will Be Tested. Unrest in Bogotá Continues, Instability in Central and South America</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Bogotá, 19th] News on the 19th: The United States, Brazil, and Chile have agreed on the terms of the proposal to be submitted to the Pan-American Conference. The motion strongly condemns the Soviet Union and calls on Western Hemisphere countries to "sanction communism." The motion, which is more strongly worded than expected before the rebellion in Colombia, will be submitted to the General Assembly on the 19th or 20th.</p>
<p>Shooting incidents occurred here again on the 18th, and the presidential palace was also affected. Unconfirmed reports claim that the death toll from two clashes on the 18th was as high as twelve, with seven civilians and five soldiers killed. The Ministry of the Army denies that anyone was killed. A five-member subcommittee comprising the United States, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Cuba met for three hours to discuss the anti-communist motion. Uruguay and Cuba have yet to decide whether they are willing to chair the case. The Pan-American Conference has begun to accelerate its plan to pass the agenda. The steering committee, composed of chief representatives, will begin to continue the meeting in order to complete the agenda on the 19th. The agenda already includes the new mutual defense pact of the Pan-American Organization, the anti-communist motion, and another motion related to foreign colonies in the Western Hemisphere. The main test of the conference, especially for the United States, is the anti-communist motion.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] It was revealed on the 18th that the State Department had received unconfirmed reports that communist or communist-backed groups may attempt to seize power in Chile and Ecuador within weeks. The State Department pointed out that these reports lack official confirmation. One of the reports appears to be consistent with an official announcement by the Chilean government, which stated that the country's Communist Party plans to launch an uprising on May 1, aimed at kidnapping President Videla and other military and political leaders. Regarding the report on Ecuador, it stated that "conservatives," with the help of the Communist Party, will seize power around June 1. Costa Rican Security Minister General Lani Picado said in Mexico City that the Communist Party plans to launch uprisings in Chile, Venezuela, and British Jamaica in the near future. Senior officials of the Brazilian government also attributed the bombing that destroyed most of the military base in Brasilia on the 16th to a conspiracy by international communists.</p>

<h3>Cuba Celebrates Fifty Years of Independence; Truman's Speech</h3>
<p>The Whole World Thirsts for Peace and Freedom</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Today marks the 50th anniversary of Cuba's declaration of independence from four centuries of Spanish rule. President Truman addressed a joint session of both houses of Congress, stating that the biggest issue today is whether humanity's universal desire for peace and freedom will survive or perish. This is a truth that the whole world cannot forget.

<h3>The Result of the Valuation of the China Textile Corporation Is Submitted for Review; The Total Value of Real Estate Exceeds Two Trillion; The Listing of Shares Can Be Completed Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Own Correspondent] The valuation work for the sale of the China Textile Corporation was formally completed last week. The complete results have been taken to Beijing by a special person for review by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The equipment and plant values of the China Textile Corporation's factories, including those in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin, amounted to more than 193 million yuan based on the currency value of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937); if converted to the current price index, the number is staggering, and the real estate of each factory is not included. During the valuation process, experts believed that the depreciation of the factory equipment value was very important, so the currency value of the 26th year of the Republic of China was used as the standard. The value of the land is determined by the location and utility, so the 4th month of the 36th year of the Republic of China (April 1947) was used as the standard. The total real estate value of each factory is more than two trillion yuan, and the current value is even higher than this number. The principle for the sale of this state-owned enterprise, which was previously decided, is to sell two-thirds of all factories, while the state retains one-third. Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin are all handled according to this ratio, not as rumored, that only northern factories are sold and southern factories are retained. As for what types of factories the state will retain, it is said that the valuation committee has provided a number of specific principles. Generally, the China Textile Corporation's factories that make great contributions to military and civilian use will be retained for the sake of national economy and people's livelihood. At the same time, another principle is that factories that are too large in scale and cannot be purchased and operated by private financial resources will not be sold. In addition, some factories with particularly excellent operating results will also be retained by the public for demonstration purposes. Apart from these, they will be converted to private operation as much as possible. As for the listing of China Textile Corporation's shares, the relevant parties are actively preparing. It is said that there are many looking-on groups of power. Once the majority of the shares for sale can be determined, the shares can be listed immediately. The relevant parties will completely complete this matter within next month.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and Governor Chang Continue to Discuss Subsidy Measures for Public Utilities</h3>

It is reported that a method of settling foreign exchange one and a half months in advance has been largely decided. The loan issue has also been agreed in principle, but the Central Bank's loan targets are limited to banks and cannot be directly lent to various companies. Therefore, the Municipal Bank will come forward to borrow from the Central Bank, and then lend to various public utility companies. As for the loan method, it is still necessary to study it in detail.</p>

<h3>Children's Health and Welfare Institute Resumes Independent Operation and Expands Services</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Children's Health and Welfare Institute, established long ago, was transformed into a municipal institution last year due to insufficient funding, after Chairman Pan Gongzhan of the institute discussed the matter with Mayor Wu. Director Yun Boqin of the institute petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to take over in September of last year. However, after eight months, the bureau only instructed the institute to dismiss staff nurses and return infants. The bureau took over two buildings on Beihai Ning Road and converted them into a labor club. However, the institute's external debts were not fully resolved. The director of the institute believed that health and welfare services were urgently needed and that the authorities had no intention of continuing the operation. Therefore, on March 25 of this year, he petitioned the Municipal Government to resume independent operation. Regarding the debt and building issues, he consulted Chairman Pan, who, to maintain credit, instructed the director of the institute to fully repay the principal and interest. The portion of the debt that the Social Affairs Bureau was supposed to repay was also to be raised and repaid by the institute. Pan also separately petitioned Mayor Wu and Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, requesting that they protect the health and welfare of women and infants and return the institute's buildings. It is reported that the institute's future operations will focus on accepting abandoned infants. It has also decided to establish a demonstration zone for maternal and child health experiments in Hongkou North Sichuan Road and plans to go to Beijing to consult with the Central Hygiene Experimental Institute. It is said that influential figures in the central government have agreed to provide financial support.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Elected President: City to Celebrate with Flags Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The news that Chairman Chiang had been elected as the first constitutional president of China with an overwhelming majority of votes in the National Assembly was transmitted to Shanghai by radio at 12:55 PM yesterday. This newspaper immediately notified various private and public radio stations to make an emergency extra edition broadcast. The Central Daily News, Heping Daily, and Xinwenbao also immediately published extra editions in red, using several large trucks to deliver them along the main roads. This reporter witnessed crowds thronging Nanjing Road and scrambling to pick up the extra editions to read. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Special Police Department and the union hung huge red banners on Wujin Road and Maigen Road, proclaiming "Celebrating Chairman Chiang's Election as the First President of the Republic of China." Of course, in the eyes of the citizens, the chairman's election was inevitable. Passersby jokingly said, "The chairman's election is not news; not being elected would be news!" However, the new honor of the head of state could not suppress the joy in their hearts. Setting off firecrackers and shouting slogans were just a glimpse of their enthusiasm! The temperament of the Chinese people is relatively calm and not easily agitated, but yesterday was an exception.</p>
<p>Since 9:00 AM yesterday, the radios of major companies and public organizations in the city have been tuned in to listen to this historic news. The moment-by-moment developments in the National Assembly were broadcast to Shanghai by six major radio stations, including Asia-America Record.

The radio then broadcast a wave of cheers from the assembly, "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live the President!"</p>
<p>To express their respect for the head of state, the citizens of Shanghai will celebrate with flags throughout the city today and hold a grand celebration rally. The helmsman who has steered the fate of the nation for twenty years has today been entrusted with new responsibilities by 400 million compatriots. This time, he really wanted to yield to a more capable person, but after all, he could not escape the responsibility of history. "The ship of the nation" is still in dangerous storms today, and it still needs the unity of the people to overcome the difficulties. From the jubilation of the citizens of Shanghai, we see the centripetal force of the nation.</p>
<h3>Shen Shigui and Others Occupy Enemy Property: Imprisonment Ordered After Repeated Refusals to Vacate</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shen Shigui, manager of Tianbao Hall Pharmacy, Li Linfu, manager of Yongfu Electrical Supplies, Shi Zeqing, manager of Shanghai Store, and Tan Zhengyan, manager of Yaguang Dry Cleaning Store, were taken into custody by the District Procuratorate yesterday for refusing to vacate the Ziyuanzhuang houses at 18 Shanyin Road. It is said that during the victory of the 34th year (1945), the defendants, greedy for petty gains, entered into lease agreements with Japanese residents, renting the houses there. Subsequently, the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region took over the properties and put them up for auction. The Central Bank purchased them, but the defendants repeatedly refused to move out despite repeated reminders. The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the China Trust Bureau requested instructions from the Executive Yuan, which issued an order stating: "If the contracts for residents using enemy and puppet properties state that the Clearing Office may notify them to vacate one month in advance, the residents should abide by this agreement. Those who stubbornly refuse to move out should be forcibly evicted by the municipal government in accordance with the law, and the residents should not be allowed to gather crowds to coerce or arbitrarily occupy the properties." During the investigation at the District Procuratorate yesterday, the prosecutor urged Shen and others to move out, but their attitude remained unusually tough, so he ordered their imprisonment. The other defendants, Tang Bonian of Xiang Sheng Woodwork Store and Wen Songqing of Henry Watch Store, expressed their willingness to discuss relocation and were released on bail.</p>
<h3>Fourth General Meeting of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Custody Committee Held Yesterday: Three Issues Related to Agriculture, Medicine, etc. Resolved: Utilizing UNRRA Supplies to Manufacture DDT</h3>

In addition to hearing work reports from the Secretariat of the Custody Committee, the Material Supply General Warehouse, and the Finance Committee, several motions were discussed and the following three issues related to agriculture and medicine were resolved: (1) To plan for drug production, it was decided to utilize the equipment, materials, and raw materials supplied by UNRRA to first organize a company to mass-produce DDT. This company will seek external investment to ensure its permanent existence and achieve corporatization. Although other drugs cannot all be produced by companies at present, they are still being continuously manufactured, with some being done in cooperation with the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Swift Processing of Agricultural Reclamation Machinery</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Resources Committee had previously suggested that the Custody Committee establish a chemical fertilizer manufacturing plant. Yesterday's general meeting decided in principle to approve it, and the issue of funding for the plant will first be submitted to the committee's Finance Committee for detailed study. (3) Regarding the handling of UNRRA supplies received by the Agricultural Reclamation Machinery Management Office, it was decided that they should be processed swiftly. (A) Hand tools, livestock tools, well drilling machines, pumps, etc., should be distributed to farmers immediately at low prices. However, Shanghai has other institutions lending equipment, so it should not receive further allocation. (B) Flour mills, cotton gins, oil presses, etc., were previously used by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Farmers Bank, but the results were not satisfactory in terms of fully utilizing them. Therefore, ownership should be reclaimed and allocated to established institutions (such as flour mills, cotton mills, and oil mills). (C) The committee will cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and provincial governments to design agricultural demonstration farms in South China and Taiwan. (D) Agricultural implements shipped from abroad that are not suitable for use in China should all be handed over to the Agricultural Machinery Company to be melted down into iron and manufactured into suitable implements. (E) The committee's agricultural implement repair factory will continue to exist temporarily, but it is hoped that it will be transferred to local industrial institutions or cooperatives at low prices for independent operation in the near future.</p>

<h3>Fraud Case at Wing On Company: Western Suspect Arrested: Served as Interpreter in Australian Army</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 13th, Wing On Company was suddenly defrauded of practical items such as shirts and leather shoes worth over 150 million yuan by a Western youth, whose whereabouts were unknown. Afterward, Guo Jianxun, the manager of the company, reported the situation to the Lao Meng Police Station and requested an investigation. Yan Cheng-sheng, the deputy chief of the branch, ordered Jiang Shangpei, the criminal investigation section chief, to solve the case within a time limit. Section member Zong Youlin, Zhang Kuidong, and officers Liu Zongtong and Ma Tianxiong investigated in all directions. Finally, around 12:00 PM yesterday, Section Chief Jiang received a tip-off that the Western conman in the Wing On Company fraud case was hiding in room 421 of the Hui Zhong Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. He immediately dispatched Section Member Zong and others to the hotel together with Guo, the manager of Wing On Company. They arrested William Thomas Deppson (20 years old), a British-Australian national, and confiscated a large number of stolen goods such as shirts and leather boxes from the room and took them to the bureau together.</p>
<p>According to his confession: He previously worked as an interpreter in the Australian army. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong two days ago and opened a room in the Hui Zhong Hotel. Because he was short of money, he first went to Lawrence &amp; Company, a British firm at 222 Sichuan Road, intending to swindle ten watches but failed. Then, he found two blank letterheads of the American Association in the room, and a plan was formed in his mind. He telephoned Wing On Company, impersonating Brown, the secretary of the American Association, falsely claiming that a friend named Siston would come to purchase goods with a letter and requesting them to receive him. After Guo agreed, he happily went and presented the forged Brown letter, selected more than ten pieces of practical items, totaling 157 million yuan in legal tender, and asked them to collect payment from the American Association on Fuzhou Road. The goods were taken away by him. Afterward, the company sent someone to the American Association to collect the money, but they learned that there were no such persons as Brown and Siston, and it was only confirmed that the letterhead did belong to the American Association. They then realized they had been deceived and reported to the police, and he was finally arrested.</p>

<h3>Review Group to Meet Today to Review the Issue of Purchasing Surplus Rice; Chairman of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee Talks About Absolutely No Impact on Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The Review Group Meeting, jointly formed by the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the American Chinese Relief Mission, the Audit Department, and other institutions, will convene a regular meeting this afternoon (20th) at the address of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee on Nanjing Road to decide whether to purchase surplus rice from the market. At that time, reporters from this city's newspapers will also be invited to attend to listen to outside opinions.</p>
<p>According to Ren Xiqun, chairman of the Citizens' Food Distribution Committee, told reporters: In the past 50 days, the prices in this city, if compared with rice prices, from the end of February to the 19th, the wholesale price of premium white japonica rice has risen by 30%, and the retail price of special grade japonica rice has risen by 20%. Compared with the rate of increase of other general prices, rice prices are still stable. In the past, the highest amount of rice arriving in the North and South markets each day was more than 20,000 dan, with an average of more than 10,000 dan. Recently, the daily arrival of rice has decreased to less than 5,000 dan. The reason is that transportation costs have soared, and prices in the producing areas have also increased. For example, the price of rice in Wuxi is, on average, 50,000 yuan higher than in this city every day. As a result, the amount of rice transported from Wuxi and other places to Shanghai has been decreasing recently. Rice from Suzhou and Qingpu is also flowing back, being transported to Wuxi instead, because transportation costs are lower, unlike the more difficult transportation from Suzhou River to Shanghai. However, although the arrival of rice in this city has fallen to less than 5,000 dan, there are still 470,000 dan of rice allocated each month, so on average, it can still maintain the highest number of more than 20,000 dan of rice arriving each day. The reason why rice prices can be more stable than other prices lies in this. As for the recent rumors that purchasing surplus rice will stimulate the rise in rice prices, it is not entirely true. The Municipal Government Meeting recently decided that the purpose of purchasing surplus rice is to maintain the source of rice in order to increase reserves. At the same time, it is also preparing for the allocation of rice during the lean months of August and September. Moreover, the rice to be purchased is limited to those remaining requested to be purchased by grain merchants. Therefore, this purchase will definitely not affect rice prices and cause them to fluctuate.</p>
<h3>Cargo Owners Suppress Prices in an Attempt to Sell; Rice Market Psychology is Weak; Oil Market Surges, Prices Increase Unanimously</h3>
<p>The market in this city has turned downwards, due to lower prices reported in Wuxi the other day, and prices in Zhoupu and surrounding areas have also fallen. Market psychology is weak. In addition, actual sales are sluggish, and more goods are arriving. Cargo owners are suppressing prices in an attempt to sell. The North Market has fallen more, with high-quality white japonica rice falling by 100,000 yuan, medium and inferior quality rice falling by 150,000 yuan, early thin rice and indica rice both lower by 100,000 yuan, while special grade japonica rice stands firm at 4 million yuan. The South Market has generally fallen by 50,000 yuan, but the market has already rebounded. The People's Livelihood Distribution Committee sold 850 shi of deteriorated japonica rice in the South Market. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 8,687 shi.</p>
<p>Flour is seeing mixed trends of weakness and firmness. The opening was weak, because prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were weak, and the decline in rice prices made it difficult to boost market psychology. Lao Che flour once fell to 1.38 million yuan, and Bingchuan flour to 1.39 million yuan. Later, merchants slightly bought at lower prices, and Bingchuan flour rose to 1.41 million yuan, and Lao Che flour closed at 1.4 million yuan, each rising by 10,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brand flour fell, with Jiancheng falling by 5,000 yuan and Peacock and other brands falling by 10,000 yuan. Wheat bran also fell by a small amount of 15,000 yuan, and wheat fell to 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains rose unanimously, due to rumors of an increase in foreign exchange rates. Merchants competed to buy first. Soybeans opened flat, but rose by 50,000 yuan due to the patronage of oil factories. Corn was抢购 by the Qingdao merchants and rose sharply by 250,000 yuan. Mung beans rose sharply, increasing by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Selected Qing beans were also acquired by the northern merchants, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. Red beans also rose by 100,000 yuan. Sesame was acquired by the Tianjin merchants, rising sharply by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were拉吸 by the Guangdong merchants and rose wildly again by 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil triggered a violent rise, due to rising raw material prices and strong rumors of higher foreign exchange rates. Market psychology was shaken, and cargo owners held on. Jih Tong raw oil has broken through the 10 million yuan mark, reaching 10.2 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 yuan. Soybean oil rose even more sharply, with Tong Feng Qiu oil initially opening at 8.65 million yuan, then Da Tong opening at 8.8 million yuan, and finally Da You soybean oil changing hands at a high price of 8.95 million yuan, a wild increase of 450,000 yuan. 清油 oil is being acquired for export by Zhongzhi Factory, and the market price is similar to soybean oil, causing all oils to quickly catch up. Small cart sesame oil rose by 500,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>New Longjing Weak and Declining</h3>
<p>Longjing tea, exclusively for domestic sales, has seen its new product for this year, since its launch, initially show its potential, with buyers competing for it. However, recently, tea sales in Tianjin and other places have slowed down, and the sources from producing areas are arriving one after another, and the quality is getting older day by day.

As for the old tea with dwindling reserves, the owners are selling it as before, continuing to show a hovering state. The 洋庄 tea market remains firm and stable, and sellers are hesitant. However, exporters are still not giving up on the 36th year of 平水 Pearl Tea. In terms of the trend, in this situation, there is no sign of a downward fall.</p>

Both the quantity and quality of education are necessary conditions for the success of democratic politics. This principle is too obvious for the author to elaborate on here. The task of this article is by no means to explain the importance of education to democracy (which is universally known), but to explain a contradictory phenomenon in which contemporary democratic countries neglect education while loudly advocating democracy.</p>
<p>Among contemporary democratic countries, the United States is naturally second to none. The United States not only considers itself the most democratic country (which may indeed be the case), but also takes on the great responsibility of safeguarding democracy, promoting democracy, and educating other countries in democracy. In order to save democracy, the United States participated in the First World War and then in the Second World War. We should not forget the United States' contribution to democratic politics. We cannot but thank the United States; it is indeed the savior of democratic countries. However, while the United States is loudly advocating democracy, a major crisis has occurred in American education, and the American authorities have neglected education, which cannot but be surprising. If this were said by us or by people from other countries, it might be considered malicious propaganda. But the person who said this, the person who said that there was a crisis in American education, is not a foreigner, but an American educator. American educator Benjamin Fine published a book last year called "Our Children Are Cheated." The author has not seen this book. The author has only seen a book review published by Lucy Sprague Mitchell in the February 7th issue of the "Saturday Review of Literature." This book review slightly reveals the content of the book.</p>
<p>According to Fine's investigation, a major crisis has occurred in American education after the war. Schools at all levels across the United States, from kindergartens to universities, are generally experiencing a shortage of teachers. As a result of the shortage of teachers, 6,000 schools have closed. Most of the teachers hired by schools that have not closed are also unqualified. Before the war, only one in 400 teachers was unqualified, but now it is one in seven. The number of teachers who have switched from other professions is also twice as high as before the war. When the war broke out in 1941, 350,000 teachers across the United States left the classroom, but only a very small number returned to the classroom after the war. At the same time, the number of students currently enrolled in American normal colleges is far less than before the war, but the number of students at all levels is rapidly increasing. This teacher shortage phenomenon will inevitably become more serious. Why is there a teacher shortage in the United States? Why are Americans unwilling to become teachers? Fine tells us that this is because American teachers are paid too little. Currently, the income in the American education sector is far lower than the income in the industrial sector. Taking last year alone, the average salary of teachers across the United States was about $40 per week per person. However, there were 10,000 teachers who earned less than $12 per week, and another 200,000 who earned only $25 or less per week. Such an amount makes it difficult for even unmarried teachers to make a living, let alone the fact that most teachers have family responsibilities. Therefore, teachers in many parts of the United States have gone on strike to demand pay raises. Moreover, American teachers not only have low salaries, but also low social status. Many places do not respect the status of teachers. Teachers are often dismissed once they get married. There are also those who tell teachers not to smoke, tell teachers not to drink in public places, tell teachers which church to attend, tell teachers to do this and do that; as for important educational policies, many teachers are not even consulted. Isn't this a disregard for the personality and status of teachers? In addition, school equipment is far inferior to what it was before the war. Many primary and secondary school buildings are very dilapidated, without sanitary facilities, and without libraries or laboratories. Universities are also overcrowded and do not have the money to build more school buildings. It is truly hard to believe that the educational situation of the richest and strongest democratic country in the world is like this. Therefore, Mitchell said with emotion: "This is a strange picture book of one of the richest and most prosperous nations on earth. This nation has long regarded universal education as a cornerstone of democracy, and universal education is particularly needed as the atomic age begins. There has never been a time when there has been such a great need to understand science as it is now, and there has never been a time when there has been such a broad recognition of the need to understand our own democratic culture and the cultures of other countries. Our country is struggling to achieve its new position in the world and is working to explain democracy to other nations. But at such a critical juncture, we are cheating our children in education, and therefore cheating democracy and cheating the world. Indeed, this is a scene that we all should rise up and do something about."</p>
<p>After reading the above report, what are our thoughts? We are naturally not qualified to criticize British education. Our education, in terms of quality and quantity, is far behind the United States. Strictly speaking, our education is simply equal to zero. But we are also learning from the United States and starting to talk about democracy. The National Assembly is in session and is planning to lay the foundation for our country's democratic politics. But what about education, which is the foundation of democratic politics? Students are on strike, teachers are on strike, and teachers across the country are struggling on the poverty line. According to the above statistics, the minimum wage for American teachers is at least $50 per month. The highest salary for teachers in our country, in terms of university professors, is still less than $30 per month (black market price). With such developed education in the United States, Americans are still shouting "cheating children, cheating democracy, cheating the world." So, what should we say ourselves? Let the representatives of the National Assembly and the government authorities say it themselves! The author doesn't need to say it!</p>
<h3>Schopenhauer's Theory of Art</h3>
<p>— Shao Xiong</p>
<p>The activity of art is different from the activity of science in its method. The artist's selection of subject matter is to take a particular person or thing, and strive to express it as a separate entity, and use the most accurate way to express all its particularities, even the most subtle particularities. Science is different. Science deals with abstract concepts, and each concept represents a number of individuals; for these concepts, science defines them and indicates their characteristics. We can say that the method of art focuses on the particular, and the method of science focuses on the universal. However, we cannot therefore say that art is a meaningless, trivial, or even childish pursuit. Because the nature of art is to represent thousands of examples with one example, to carefully and thoroughly express the single individual, person or thing, and thereby to show the class concept to which this person or thing belongs. For example, to faithfully and completely describe an event or a state of a person's life is to appropriately reveal all the individuals that constitute this event as this event, and we can obtain a clear and in-depth insight into the concept of human nature itself from this particular point of view. Therefore, although the methods of art and science are different, they have much in common in dealing with individual facts. The botanist's study of plants is to take a flower from the infinite plant kingdom and study it, analyze this flower, and use it as a sample to prove the nature of the plant itself from this single sample. The poet is the same. The poet selects a certain scene, a certain state, a certain feeling from the noisy and infinite human life, and from it shows us what human life and characteristics are. From this point of view, both science and art go from the particular to the universal.</p>
<p>Beauty is form, is the archetype, so Schopenhauer believes that the expression of art lies in trying to separate form and matter. The element of art lies in this separation, because the purpose of art is to enable us to obtain knowledge of form or archetype. The element of a work of art lies first in giving us the form but not the matter, and second in making it impossible for the viewer to mistake it for matter. Therefore, a wax figure of a person or thing cannot produce a sense of beauty and cannot be regarded as a work of art, because it is very easy for us to mistake it for a real person or thing. It not only gives us the form, but also gives us the matter. The so-called form is not only geometrical, but also philosophical, so color, plane, structure, etc. can also be regarded as form. The marble sculpture gives us pure form, and the colored oil painting also gives us pure form. We will not mistake the people or things in the oil painting for real ones.</p>
<p>The main part of Schopenhauer's essay is briefly described above. This theory of art may not be agreed upon by modern artists, but it is undoubtedly a theory that is worth our attention. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Random Talks in the Academic World (16)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>"Freedom of the Press"</p>
<p>The ideal of democracy must be entrusted to sound public opinion. Without freedom of speech, democratic politics cannot survive. President Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) of the United States made the most significant contributions to safeguarding the news and publishing industries. He once said: "National authority belongs to the people." "The people can use newspapers to supervise the government, and the government can also use newspapers to fully report the actual situation of government affairs to the people." "If speech can be free and everyone can read newspapers, this is the safest path." In a letter to E. Carington on January 16, 1786, Jefferson said: "If newspapers and government cannot coexist and one must be removed, we should not hesitate to remove the government and keep the newspapers." His attitude was so firm. He also said: "Newspapers are the most effective tool for enlightening the people. To make the general public rational, moral, and public-spirited, we must rely on the power of newspapers." Every president of the United States has attached great importance to the press. In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt said, "The most important profession in the United States is the reporter, including magazine editors. Periodicals that are popular throughout the country are particularly worthy of attention." Democracy and the press are interdependent.</p>
<p>The late Adolph Simon Ochs (born 1858, died 1935), the host of the New York Times, was an extremely important figure in the history of the American press and made many contributions to improving the standards of the press. When he took over the New York Times in 1896, he had a motto that read: "The editing of news should be concise and interesting, and its wording should be acceptable to the upper class. The transmission of news should be as rapid as possible, and its selection of materials should be impartial, without bias, without jealousy, and without being blinded by partisanship. All major public issues can be discussed in this newspaper as a forum for open discussion by informed people to reflect different opinions in society." This passage seems plain, but it is not easy to put it into practice. In summary, sincerity, fairness, conscientiousness, discernment, and erudition are the five requirements that Ochs advocated for journalists. Journalism has become a specialized academic discipline in modern times, originating in the United States, and the New York Times is the largest laboratory. With reliability, impartiality, and erudition as the criteria for evaluation, the newspaper is truly the leading newspaper in the United States. In terms of its scale and equipment, even the London Times pales in comparison.</p>
<p>Now is the era of global village, and the first-class major newspapers must have a global nature, so the source of news has become a major issue at present. In September 1944, the United States Congress passed a resolution stating that there is a responsibility to exchange news internationally, that journalists from all countries should have the convenience of collecting and disseminating news, and that governments of all countries should not discriminate. Modern international relations are extremely complex, and all nations can increase their mutual understanding by exchanging facts and ideas. The free flow of news is an important factor in maintaining world peace. The United States is currently initiating the conclusion of an international agreement called the Freedom of the Press Agreement. This agreement will guarantee journalists the freedom from censorship, but exceptions will be made for what is necessary for national military security. Whether the proposition of freedom of the press can succeed is of course not unconditional, and the efforts of the publishing industry itself are particularly important.</p>
<p>Responsible freedom is the tradition of Western culture. President Roosevelt proclaimed the Four Freedoms, the first of which was freedom of speech and expression. (Freedom of speech and expression) The spirit of responsibility is the price that freedom of speech must pay. Recently, the University of Chicago accepted a donation of $200,000 from Time magazine and Encyclopaedia Britannica, designated as the expenses of the "Freedom of Expression Research Association," and the scope of research also covers radio, film, and the book industry. The committee of 13 people is chaired by Robert H. Hutchins, honorary president of the University of Chicago, and W.E. Hocking, retired professor of philosophy at Harvard University, is also a member. The research results were written into a report by Hocking, entitled "Freedom of the Press." (Published in Chicago in 1947) Its conclusion is that the crisis of freedom of speech lies in the publishing industry itself. It is not enough to say that totalitarian countries prohibit the publication of dissenting opinions. However, if freedom is abused without restriction, or if the news is reversed, or if it is exaggerated and exaggerated, or if it promotes racial prejudice, or if it incites hatred between people, or if it caters to vulgarity and is willing to be inferior, that is, the so-called yellow journalism, all of these are latent crises in the newspaper industry. In the 19th century, individual freedom was regarded as supremely important, but now the public interest and social security should at least be as important as individual freedom. Any freedom is conditional, and it is necessary to correct the deficiencies and remedy the abuses. The publishing industry has failed to fulfill its responsibilities, and this is not only a matter for newspaper editors alone, but also for the government, society, and readers. The United States is the country that most values freedom of speech, but how to achieve a perfect and harmonious balance between freedom and responsibility is still a problem to be solved. Responsible freedom is originally an ideal, and it should also be an endless effort for mankind.</p>
<h3>The Psychology of Rumors (3)</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>In the previous article, we have pointed out that rumors produce the characteristics of "exaggeration, distortion, understanding, and complexity" due to the recycling effect in memory. General images are conceptualized, and individuality is immersed in types. The more vague and empty the image, the easier it is to go down this path, and rumors breed in this ambiguous consciousness.</p>
<p>For example, when we talk about ancient beauties, we have no concrete impression in our minds, because no one has ever seen them with their own eyes, so we are very likely to conceptualize them, so there are boundless words such as "one point taller is too long, one point shorter is too short, one point fatter is too fat, and one point thinner is too thin." In other words, we only know that she is extremely beautiful—a typical beauty—not too tall, not too short, not too fat, not too thin. The result is naturally "exaggeration" and "distortion." Precisely because we only have a vague impression, everything is empty, and reverie is very convenient to add color to these frameworks. The so-called understanding, also known as embellishment, fabrication, and naturally tends to be complex. Therefore, the more there is no real news and the more scarce the news, the more rumors will arise. The best way to put out rumors is of course to open up the truth as much as possible.</p>
<p>In this way, we can understand why rumors are most popular in wartime and in the army. Military secrets shroud all actions, and everything is in "keeping a tight lip." At the same time, because of the imminent dangers and personal interests, everyone is eager to know the current situation and current actions. On the one hand, there is an urgent need for knowledge, and on the other hand, "silence is golden," and it is impossible to figure out the situation, so rumors prevail. "Winds come from empty caves," and rumors are of course due to the lack of news, but people's desire for news is even more of a root cause of rumors.</p>
<p>From the perspective of social psychology, the creators and disseminators of rumors often have their functions. Listening to rumors or accepting rumors is of course due to a psychological desire, and creating or disseminating rumors is also to satisfy another psychological desire. This is people's desire to win. Being able to say what others do not know and showing that one's news is well-informed seems to be a way to stand out. It is only for this kind of coercion that the spread of rumors is faster than "sending messages by post." Some rumors spread faster than news. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Lao Tzu on Tao, Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>Lao Tzu's discussion of Tao, Virtue, Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Wisdom says: "After losing Tao, then comes Virtue; after losing Virtue, then comes Benevolence; after losing Benevolence, then comes Righteousness; after losing Righteousness, then comes Propriety. Propriety is the thinness of loyalty and sincerity, and the beginning of chaos; Foresight is the flower of Tao, and the beginning of foolishness; Therefore, the great man dwells in the thick and does not dwell in the thin; he dwells in the real and does not dwell in the flower; therefore, he discards that and takes this." (Chapter 38) Now, I interpret its meaning to see Lao Tzu's profound intention.</p>
<p>This chapter discusses the traces of the evolution of human affairs: from mixed to painted, from combined to separated, from pure to mixed, from simple to flowery. At the beginning of the Tao body, it is mixed and simple, a state of stillness; it turns into movement, spreads and people and things are born. Man is also a realm of natural operation, and shares the Tao body with things as virtue. In the beginning, it is not far from the Tao, and the virtue is complete and each gets its place, and they are mixed together and can accommodate each other. As time goes on, virtue may be lost, and there are those who do not get their place, then they do not accommodate each other and disputes arise; the sage often advocates benevolence, hoping that those who have lost their place can accommodate each other, and the disputes can be eliminated - this is why benevolence saves the loss of virtue. Benevolence is love, and only love can accommodate each other. Virtue is lost, and benevolence is advocated to make up for it; but the art of making up for it has a limited use, so righteousness is advocated to relieve its poverty. Righteousness is the way to make it appropriate. Because benevolence has the intention of using love, its love is often difficult to spread, not as good as those who have complete virtue who have no intention of accommodating each other, and are mixed together and can accommodate each other; then establish righteousness to show the thickness and difference of love, hoping that among those whose love is not widespread, those who are reached, the difference in thickness and thinness can get their due, then those who have lost virtue, although they cannot be mixed together and accommodate each other, have the love of thickness and difference between them, which is still better than nothing. But if there is a difference in thickness and thinness, then the festivals arise, and propriety arises. Righteousness is the way to make the difference in thickness and thinness appropriate, and propriety is the festival of righteousness. Moreover, the difference in thickness and thinness is a matter of difference; if there is a difference, then there can be no intention; if there is intention, then there is sincerity and falsehood. The festivals that show the difference in thickness and thinness are often not sincere or true, and falsehood and deception are often written about here, which is why propriety is "the thinness of loyalty and sincerity, and the beginning of chaos". "Loyalty and sincerity" means sincerity, and the practice of propriety is often insufficient, so it is said that "the thinness of loyalty and sincerity". If loyalty and sincerity are thin, then fraud and pretense arise; fraud and falsehood are the steps of contention; therefore, it is said that "the beginning of chaos". Foresight is a matter of wisdom. The smallness of wisdom does not see the whole Tao, and has not obtained "this discipline" (see Chapter 14), and often holds on to the ancient and controls the present (ask above), pretending to be foresight, not knowing that the mechanism between cause and effect is very subtle, and its affairs are very quiet, using wisdom to play tricks, its effect is clumsy, because what it knows in the former is not the reality of Tao, and the wisdom of the district is enough to nourish its foolishness, so it is said that "foresight is the flower of Tao, and the beginning of foolishness". "The great man" is a scholar who is determined to learn the Tao. "Thick" means morality; "thin" means benevolence, righteousness and propriety. "Real" is Tao; "flower" is wisdom. Those who study the Tao embrace the reality of morality, their pure heart is mixed together and accommodates things, without intimacy or alienation between them, without the use of benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom, so it is said that "discard that and take this" - "this" is morality, "that" is benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom.</p>
<p>Tao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are the essentials of life, so Lao Tzu's discussion of life first marks these numbers, clarifies the order of their occurrence, and sees the end of the root, and then knows what to discard and take. Only Lao Tzu values morality and despises benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom. Because in the late Zhou Dynasty, fraud and falsehood flourished, and contention arose greatly, the Confucianists advocated benevolence, righteousness, propriety and wisdom to save it, but its effect was only enough to nourish chaos and separation, Lao Tzu immediately established its root, clarified the essentials of morality, hoping that people would return to simplicity and change customs. Lao Tzu knew that the movement of the world often goes back and forth between combination and separation, and governance and chaos. In the late Zhou Dynasty, separation and chaos had reached their extreme, and the situation should be reversed. Lao Tzu then pretended to establish words to assist in the reversal, so that the people would be spared from suffering, and his intention can be said to be bitter.</p>

<h3>"Losing a Book is Like Losing an Old Friend"</h3>
<p>— Tizhai</p>
<p>It seems like a line from Fangweng's poem: "Gaining a sword is like adding a strong servant, losing a book is like losing an old friend." This resonates deeply with those of us who have collected old books and experienced hardship. In my youth, after reading the postscript of the "Jin Shi Lu," I often sighed at the experiences of Yi'an Jushi. However, I did not fully understand the joy of brewing tea and composing poems in the Guilai Hall, only the grief and indignation of national sentiments. As I grew older, personal gains and losses became a concern, adding another layer of emotion. Although this stems from my ego, it reflects the sorrows and joys of middle age. There is no need to hide it, nor to explain it further.</p>
<p>China is a country with many disasters, a long history, and much culture, which is both endearing and heartbreaking. Wars are often waged with the goal of destruction, while lovers of antiquities try to salvage remnants from the smoke and flames, creating a tragic atmosphere from the start. The tiny fragments rescued with great effort are often lost in unavoidable circumstances, leading to indescribable frustration. Luo Xuetang described in his "Fifty Days of Dream Traces" the fragments of oracle bones found in Anyang. They were scattered everywhere in the fields, and he collected dozens of sacks. These are the raw materials for the "Shuqi Qianhou Bian," now worth over ten million. Similarly, Luo saw in the archives of the Ministry of Education dozens of sacks of files from the Grand Secretariat, already packed and waiting to be sold by weight as waste paper. Thanks to his efforts, they were purchased and preserved, becoming the numerous volumes of Ming and Qing historical materials published by the Commercial Press today. And countless more remain unorganized. Recently, we heard that a large collection of Luo's antiquities in his Lushun residence was taken away by truck after the victory. Because the load was too heavy, some were abandoned along the road. Fortunately, Luo died before this happened; otherwise, wouldn't he have wailed loudly in his "Collected Articles" (his autobiography)? I heard that his son, Fuyi, has been appointed to teach at Peking University. He will surely write another poignant essay for people to sigh and mourn over, right? In the past, I read Chen Dengyuan's "Study on the Collection and Dispersal of Chinese Classics" and learned that the so-called "Five Disasters of Niu Hong" are commonplace in China. The Song dynasty woodblock-printed books from the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng were used as waste paper to wipe opium pipes by Liu Zhendian's remnants and bandits, demonstrating the extravagance of our nation. Ji Wenda Gong once said, "How easily one speaks of the fleeting nature of mountains and rivers, but seeing the Gongyang Commentary, I cannot restrain my tears." That was only because he saw servants using the Song edition of the Gongyang Commentary to wrap snacks. It was not even used to wipe opium tools. If Wenda were alive three hundred years later, what lamentations would he make!</p>
<p>Indeed, books stacked on the desk are not necessarily read or used every day, but it is like a wealthy person with banknotes. Having more is not necessarily for spending, and looking at them is a pleasure. Thus, a love for wealth becomes a leisure pursuit, not necessarily for its practical value. Collecting books is probably the same. However, because we know a few characters and have not learned to trade on the exchange or possess the wealth-accumulating skills of Mr. Zigong, we still rely on books to write or deceive people for a living. Our longing for books is more urgent than utilitarianism, akin to the poor's need for rice, salt, firewood, and clothing. It is like being hungry and cold without food or clothing, and this suffering is different from that of aesthetes. Therefore, if books are likened to good friends, I remember those who can help with financial difficulties, not just companions for leisurely conversations on a clear night. Perhaps some will laugh at this as vulgar, but that is the reality, so what can be done?</p>
<p>My personal study is quite eclectic, dabbling in everything. I admire the narrow and deep studies of scholars, but I am also somewhat afraid. This is because I feel that "focusing one's will" is a synonym for dryness and simplicity, something that common people dare not aspire to. Therefore, the scope of my book buying is virtually unlimited. Except for physics, mathematics, and other subjects that I do not understand, I do not reject anything that can increase my general knowledge. In the past, books were really cheap. The Complete Works of Lu Xun sold for twenty yuan and could be discounted by 18%, costing only sixteen yuan, which is equivalent to sixteen million today! That's a million times difference! Can anyone believe this? Recently, because I needed to teach a little history and delve into archaeology and historical materials, I thought of the "Zhou Jin Wen Cun" and "Yizhai Jigu Lu," which I bought for twenty-four and ten-odd yuan in legal tender. The "San Dai Ji Jin Wen Cun" in the Sanma Road store costs as much as twenty million, leaving me speechless! The other day, the bookstore wrote to me, informing me that they had received several volumes of the "Oriental Studies Journal," each priced at 250,000! These are things I was unwilling to spend money on before. Any kind of Qing dynasty notebook in engraved form, with only a few volumes, costs over 300,000 to 400,000. A friend told me the other day that he bought a series of books on the Qing dynasty's tributary states for over 100,000 yuan at a cold stall in Suzhou, which is a rare opportunity. It is a pity that there is no one like Zhang Tingji, who recorded the market price every day and month (Zhang's "Qing Yi Ge Ancient Artifact Writings" all record the prices) for reference in future generations! Not even further back, just based on the changes in the last three years, it is already like a distant era!</p>
<p>The only books I have are all in my hometown. Calculating, it has been over ten years since I last saw them. First, the Japanese came, wanting to burn and search. Many magazines and new books were lost in the flames of war. Then, the war expanded, and the place where the books were stored became a ruin of war, and the little that was left was taken away by thieves. Finally, after the restoration of the country, new flames of war came, making it impossible to even visit. This fully embodies the "remembering" in "remembering an old friend." However, there is no shortage of good friends returning from airplanes and ships. Even if they have gone through great hardships, everyone can shake hands and laugh, or, like visiting old places and finding half of them ghosts, burst into tears in familiar places. Those old friends without knowledge can never return! If they were conscious, what would they think when they were reduced to ashes or transferred to the hands of a new friend? As far as I know, the new owners of the books have generally changed their nature. They are either from the stock exchange or partners in cotton yarn or soap factories. In the past, poor scholars often liked to write a couplet for themselves, saying, "The book field has no tax for descendants to cultivate." I advise you scholars to give up. Although there are no golden houses in books, books do not enter without golden houses. They have become Ajiao in the cultural marketplace!</p>
<h3>On Suicide</h3>
<p>— Haiyan</p>
<p>Recently, there have been suicides among male and female students in various places—student suicides have been seen frequently in recent years. However, this time it has prompted everyone to study the reasons for suicide. In fact, there is no need to study the reasons. Is it not clear? Society is such a society.</p>
<p>Instead, it is somewhat interesting to analyze the psychology of those who commit suicide from the perspective of their attitude towards life. Students are intellectuals, different from the "common men and women who hang themselves in ditches" among wealthy daughters or humble women, who do so purely because of simple minds. It is generally speculated that the reason for suicide is "pessimism" and "feeling that life is boring." However, I feel that those who truly feel pessimistic and bored with life may not resolutely seek death; on the contrary, most of them probably have many hopes for the world and have considerable interest in life. As a result, when despair comes, they demand a final accounting of themselves, demand repayment of what they are owed by hope, and end it with death. Of course, there are also those like Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who have long felt weary of life and die calmly, but they are not the majority.</p>
<p>Those with a pessimistic outlook on life generally adopt chronic suicide. It is not easy to change the views of such people; however, those who commit suicide immediately after being stimulated can be saved: as long as they are given a way to vent, they can be transformed into warriors who actively fight against the evil forces of the world. Because the more someone has no attachment to the world, the more it reflects that before despair, they were very attached to and fond of the world, no, very affectionate; otherwise, they would not have the determination to commit suicide and would have long ago committed chronic suicide. Suicides often leave behind farewell letters, which can be taken as evidence; if they do not feel that there is still any "taste" in the world, or anything to be missed, why leave such a trace in the world? The letter itself is "taste," still "left" to those who can be "missed" in a broad sense. Therefore, if it is possible to give them a greater "taste," and this "taste" can eliminate all the factors that make the environment dull, why can't their thought of eternal life be restored?</p>
<p>The question is how to make them get a greater taste - the opportunity to fight life.</p>
<h3>On Not Being Able to Write</h3>
<p>— Yun Gong</p>
<p>I have always adhered to one principle when it comes to writing, which is that I will not write when I cannot write. And when I do write, I stop when I have said what I want to say, and I never drag on or pad out the article. Sometimes, at the request of an editor, there are exceptions where I have to write an impromptu piece in a hurry, which is unavoidable. That often embarrasses me, because when I can't write, I really can't write a single word.</p>
<p>Once, my thoughts were difficult, and the editor's deadline was pressing. I had to submit the manuscript the next morning. I didn't have any inspiration until I went to see a movie at a theater that night. Five minutes before the movie started, I suddenly had an epiphany. I then used a pencil to write the manuscript in a notebook that I carried with me.</p>
<p>Usually, when I have the time or interest to write but can't, I also have my own coping methods, because I feel that it is not easy to find the time to write, and I should not miss the opportunity when I have a moment of free time. At this time, I often take out a beautifully bound and well-printed single volume by a popular writer to read. The content of his articles can inspire me. And the mere fact that he can publish such a book can also arouse my competitive spirit. Under this stimulation, the article is forced out.</p>
<p>Some people also say that the reason why they can't write is that they can't find a suitable topic. This requires constant attention. I often record the topics I plan to write about in a small notebook. Usually, there are only one or two stars of thoughts, which, when written, are about fifty or sixty words to one or two hundred words, not enough for a short article. Here, I feel that writing articles is like rolling a snowball, the more you roll, the more you get. When you have collected enough material, an article is produced.</p>
<p>In short, although writing is a minor skill, its principles seem to be applicable to handling any matter. In recent years, American industry and commerce have been studying vocational training, occupational relationships, occupational methods, and other items. Those in charge of these matters must pay attention to observation, record at any time, and analyze at any time. I think that with their experience, they will definitely be able to write a good article, and except for the author who is just filling in the numbers, those who write good articles must also be able to understand things by analogy and have a higher understanding than others.</p>
<h3>The President and the Church</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>American presidents, like ordinary people, are also followers of Jesus Christ. However, they belong to different churches; among them, Presbyterians are the most numerous, with six in total. Unitarians have four, Episcopalians have two, and Congregationalists, Quakers, Disciples of Christ, and Dutch Reformed each have one. Other presidents do not belong to any church, although they also attend church services. Truman's church is the "First Baptist Church" in Washington, a 144-year-old red brick building eight blocks from the White House.</p>
<p>In the early days, pastors often felt nervous and apprehensive about the chief executive's attendance. One Episcopalian pastor named Abercrombie always asked President Washington, who was seated in the front row, to leave whenever Holy Communion was about to begin. Later, Washington simply stopped going to church on Communion Sundays.</p>
<p>When Lincoln was running for Congress and had not yet entered the White House, he had a contest with Peter Cartwright, a Methodist minister. Cartwright often criticized Lincoln's "irreligious attitude." When the campaign began, Cartwright held a series of faith revival services. At one such service, Lincoln was also present, sitting in the back of the hall. During his sermon, Cartwright said to the audience, "Please stand up if you want to go to heaven." Everyone stood up, except for Lincoln, who remained seated.</p>
<p>Cartwright continued, "Please stand up if you want to go to hell." Lincoln still sat motionless.</p>
<p>So Cartwright announced, "Everyone except Mr. Lincoln has stood up once; we would like to know where he hopes to go."</p>
<p>Lincoln stood up and said calmly, "I want to go to Congress." With that, he left.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Many things from the distant past still seem like yesterday, but some things that really happened yesterday already seem like a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>In the desert, a drop of water is more precious than a pearl. In the desert of a heart without friendship, a nod or half a smile is stronger than many clever compliments, thunderous applause...</p>
<p>Truly compassionate people give "sympathy," while philanthropists only give "pity."</p>
<p>Some people are so good that they are annoying, and some people are so bad that they are lovable—most people secretly prefer the latter to the former—alas, the human heart has declined to this point.</p>
<p>When children are just beginning to understand things, adults teach them "honesty"; once children grow up and enter the world, they teach them to learn "hypocrisy."</p>
<h3>The World's Most Vicious Woman</h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>Around 1901, a widow named Belle Gunness moved to La Porte, Indiana, USA. She placed numerous marriage advertisements in newspapers and magazines, saying that she was willing to marry a man with a gentle personality who could pay her a deposit. In fact, Gunness was already forty-two years old that year, but surprisingly, men who responded to the advertisement kept coming. After these brave men arrived at her lonely farm, she always asked them to take out the money for the deposit first. Once the money was in hand, she immediately killed the man and secretly buried him. Over the course of seven years, more than forty men died at her hands! The total amount of money she swindled from these forty-odd men was over US$100,000.</p>
<p>By 1908, the local district chief finally became suspicious and wanted to investigate the widow's actions closely. Unexpectedly, she had already gotten wind of it. She set fire to her farm and fled far away, managing to escape the clutches of the law.</p>
<h3>Ling</h3>
<p>"Boos" at the National Assembly Hall have created a special record since the beginning of "booing." A male representative said, "I also agree, why boo me!" A female representative said, "Wait until I finish speaking before you boo!" And in the midst of "Boo! Boo!" she calmly finished her speech. Another female representative said, "Female representatives speak on behalf of your wives, please do not give contemptuous boos." These are all excellent words. Because the "boos" were incessant and everyone "booed," a "counter-boo struggle" program was established. According to the previous commonness that "boos" are often heard in movie theaters, when villains do bad things or during tense situations, they originate from all around the seats, mostly from children. As for the parliamentary halls in the early years of the Republic of China, they occasionally happened, and undoubtedly expressed emotions of disgust, or implied discouragement. In the dictionary, the sound is the same as "xu," and its meaning is "to blow," and a more detailed explanation, a taboo is called blowing, slowing is called "xu." Puckering lips is called blowing, a hollow mouth is called "xu." Therefore, although the two words "blowing" and "xu" are often connected, each has its meaning. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties period, when Liang Houjing ascended the Taiji Hall, his crowd "blew their lips and made noises to go up," then "blowing" was used to express joy, and "xu" was used to express disgust, both being the instinct of human organs, arising from nature. As for the common usage of entrusting someone to say good things as "blowing and praising," it is a habitual usage, no different from "propaganda, propaganda."</p>
<h3>Two Poems on a Cold Night</h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>How cold it is to be here, the four walls are silent, thinking of sleeplessness at dawn, and deeply worried, I am startled; hearing the crane's cry for a thousand years, the rooster's crow alerts me at dawn, how foolishly laughable, I chant poetry to send the short watch.</p>
<p>Suffering pervades heaven and earth, solid ice gradually frosts, encountering a vast wilderness, as if coming out of a dry and dark village, enduring the cold, I know its weight, passing through the heart, the night is longer, the plan for rice and grain is undecided, and the migrating geese bitterly follow the sun.</p>
<h3>Picture of Han Hui Building by Da Youhan for the Jizhiguanshi</h3>
<p>Leisurely mulberry fields are suitable for ten acres, ancient trees for a hundred-year term, the picture shows a house by the river outside the city, and I often remember the blue lamp and yellow scrolls; Tongde can accommodate the road for four horses, and writing esoteric texts also requires self-deprecating words, bidding farewell and driving again as a Spring Shen guest, the empty water is clear and sends dreams.</p>
<h3>Mistaken Characters</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>People nowadays often laugh at others for "writing wrong characters" (wrong characters are commonly mistaken for blank characters). For example, if a certain character should be written in a certain way, but is mistakenly written as another character, they laugh at it as "writing a wrong character." If a certain character should be read in a certain sound, but is mistakenly read in another sound, they laugh at it as "reading a wrong character." In fact, the number of characters in our country is numerous, and one character has multiple ways of writing, multiple pronunciations, and multiple meanings. Even scholars cannot fully know them all, let alone ordinary people.</p>
<p>The "mai" character in the name of the modern celebrity Zhang Junmai should have been read as "mai." Because this character is almost the same as the "li" character, it is common for people to mistakenly read it as the "li" sound. (Editor's note: When the China Democratic Socialist Party was first established in 1946, I went to the party headquarters on Yuyuan Road to visit Mr. Zhang and Mr. Xu Mengyan. Unexpectedly, the clerk there also loudly called him "Mr. Junli," which was shocking.) The two characters "mao dun" (contradiction) have become a catchphrase today. The character "dun" should be read as "zhun" with a rising tone, or read as "yun" (see the dictionary), but many people read it as "tun" with a rising tone. This is because in the Spring and Autumn period, the "dun" character in Zhao Dun's name was originally read as "tun" with a rising tone, and it is the same character. Therefore, without seeking a thorough understanding, they read it casually. According to the origin of the two characters "mao dun," they come from Han Feizi's "Using your spear to pierce your shield." This "dun" character cannot be read in the same sound as the "dun" of Zhao Dun. Because there are fewer people who read Han Feizi, more people read Zuo Zhuan, and especially more people read the old novel "Chronicles of the States," resulting in the mistaken mixing of pronunciations. Also, many people know that "he gu cai" (water chestnut) sold by Hongxing Pharmacy is read as "zhe," but some people mistakenly read it as "shu." A few months ago, there was a movie called "Su Feng Ji." "Su" should be read as "su," but some people also read it as "sheng." This is "a scholar does not know characters, only continues half of the text." Therefore, I will record a few of the laughable mistaken characters as follows:</p>
<p>A certain noble family declined, and its descendants wanted to sell the porcelain from the Song and Ming kilns collected by their ancestors. Therefore, they posted an advertisement in front of the door. However, they did not know many characters, and the "yao" (kiln) character was mistakenly written as "yin" (promiscuous). The text of the advertisement was "Selling ancient promiscuous utensils, Ming promiscuous, Ding promiscuous, Xuan promiscuous, Ge promiscuous, Ru promiscuous, all are available," which made the viewers laugh.</p>
<p>During the early Republic of China, the warlord Jiang Guiti did not know how to read. When he went to Rehe to take office as the governor, he was very happy on the day he took office, saying that he saw many shops along the street making signs with the two characters "Gui Ti" and hanging them high to express their welcome. Those who heard this were confused. After careful investigation, they suddenly realized that the so-called "Gui Ti" signs were the shop signs of noodle shops, the two characters "gua mian" (hanging noodles).</p>
<p>Gang Yi, a Manchu official in the Qing Dynasty, was the Minister of Justice and compared himself to Gao Tao in the Shun era, but he mistakenly read the "Tao" character as the "Tao" in Tao Yuanming. Whenever he reported the death of prisoners, he always changed the "yu" (died in prison) character to "shou" (thin). When Sichuan reported chasing and suppressing foreign barbarians, there was the phrase "chasing and fleeing north," and Gang Yi thought it was a mistake for "chasing and comparing the barbarians," saying that it referred to chasing and comparing the things looted by the barbarians.</p>
<p>When Cao Kun was imprisoned, he liked to write letters for people, and he often signed himself as "Bo Sou." This is because Cao was from Xigu in Tianjin, and Xigu is located on the coast of the Bohai Sea. Once, for some reason, he mistakenly wrote the water radical of the "Bo" character on the left of the "Sou" character, becoming "Bo Sou." The commentators then quoted the idiom "cow dung and horse burdock" to mock him.</p>
