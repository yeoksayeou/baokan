<h3 id="c1">孫院長說明施政方針　自力維持國家生存　戰爭非片面可放棄用兵仍爲求和平　改善制度期減人民痛苦 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕孫院長於就任後，第一次行政院會議中致詞如左：</p>
<p>此次本人出任行政院長，猶如徵服兵役，在現階段國家最艱困時期中，國家許多重要困難問題亟待解決，祗有冒險犯難，勉膺艱鉅，尙祈同仁一德一心，共同為國家突破難關，替總統分憂分勞，挽回這個艱難的局勢。</p>
<p>現在戡亂軍事正在重要的階段中，政府用兵的最後目的，在於爭取和平，過去對外抗戰，現在對內用兵，其目的皆無二致，在抗戰勝利之後，政府曾努力追求和平，由於和平不能實現，不得已而用兵，用兵的最後目的，仍在求得和平的恢復。但戰爭是雙方的事，不能片面放棄，政府亦不能將內部的事倚恃國外的力量來支持，維持國家的生存，必有其自己的條件，值此階段，如何加强政府力量，維特國家生存，我們自應集中心力，妥慎籌維，努力以赴。</p>
<p>談到外交，中國所處的國際環境，複雜動盪，甚於三年以前，抗戰以後因國內不能和平統一，無法致力建設，中國國際地位之低落，亦遠非三年前所能比擬。中國立國方針，向與世界任何國家均願和平相處，既有之友誼，同努力求其加强，如有隔閡，也願努力求其敦陸無問，此為我立國的精神，亦卽我外交的基本方針，過去是如此，今後仍然繼續不變。</p>
<p>因為八年的對外抗戰，與三的內部動亂，以致民貧財盡，生產力最銳减，國家元氣大傷，在用兵時期，國庫開支浩繁，致使幣值不穩，物價日漲，此種惡性循環，大家同此經驗，加以現在沿用的法令制度亟待改善之點亦甚多，例如近十多年來的征兵·征實制度，在過去用以支持八年戰爭，確實也收到相當的效果，但沿襲一久，人事的不臧與辦法的不合理，變本加厲，人民的負擔沉重，國家受益無多，今後在行政方面，此種制度應該詳加檢討，切實改善，以期减輕人民負担與痛苦。</p>
<p>至於財政問題，根本在於社會經濟，國內農工生產雖難望其增加，但至少不能讓他再衰落下去，國家生存所賴的財源方有根基，否則財政與經濟必將相隨而更趨劣轉，因此，獎助農村及工礦各業的發展，應該是今後國家施政當務之急。</p>
<p>至地方行政方面，亦有許多不合理現象，過去政府着力於一種制度的建立，如主計，審計制度及公文處理的程序等等末流之弊，往往使行政上辦事手續繁電，呆滯，延宕，效率為之大减，必須予以改善，過去一般地方政府負責人，均感中央過於集權，事事須決於中央，有時請示而久不得復，因之曠時慶事，此種中央集權制，在平時或許可以維持，但在非常的局面下，地方上許多問題必須當時就地解決，始能曲當事勢，不誤時機。這幾年來，外國輿論對中國政治常有不滿意的批評，大要不外是人員的貪污和政治的無效率，上級政府命令無法貫澈到下層，形成上下矇蔽的現象，此種指摘，並非全屬虛構，因為有此種種毛病，國家才有今日的艱困局面。今後必須盡吾人最大努力，坦率糾正，勇猛改善，政治有進步，國家才有生機，但這些間題決非行政院長所能單獨致力，因此不得不竭誠請求全體同仁，同下決心，努力担當責任，解決今日一切亟待解決之問題，實所深幸。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕新任行政院長孫科廿三日晨正式就職，九時半各部會長及政委陸續到達時，在京立·監委·國大代表亦紛紛前往致賀，孫氏抵達後，旋卽與翁內閣舉行交接，翁氏因事赴滬，由前秘書長李惟果代表，與孫氏辦理交接事宜，至此，行憲後首屆內閣正式轉移與第二屆內閣矣。形式極為簡單，旋卽接開首次政務會議，孫氏曾作類似施政大計之說明之報吿，闡明本屆內閣之任務，報吿畢，卽討論例案，並通過滕傑為京市長等案，旋卽散會，午孫氏並在政院一號官邸宴請全體閣員，以示聯歡</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕新任行政院各部會長，除少數於一二日內就任外，餘大多數均定廿七日到職視事。各部次長及各委會副姿員長人選，尙未全部決定，惟教部以教長梅貽琦仍在堅辭中，而部務待理，其政次卽將苜牛發表，以陳雪屏出任，代行部務。另悉；政院副秘書長一席，新人選尙未作最後決定，所有職務，已挽前副秘書長梁穎文暫時帮忙，惟梁氏表示以兩周為限。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕兼外長吳鐵城將於日內到部接任視事，奮外長王世杰連日仍照常處理公務，準備交卸。關於新閣外交政策方向，此間關係方面人士多持保留態度，不加推測，或謂吳外長為暫兼性質，一時當不致有重大變更，將俟專任外長正式任命後，經政院會議討論擬訂，並呈總統批准後，方可視為最後決定。至京中傳聞王外畏將使英說，據接近人士稱：並非全無可能。</p>
<h3 id="c4">孫科辭函　送達立院 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕立法院長孫科之辭函，廿三日已送達該院秘書處，將於廿四日第三十一次院會中提出報吿，辭函原文如次：「敬啓者，科自掌理立法院院務，歷時十又七年，今夏憲政實施，本院改組，復得與諸同仁相聚一堂，共策國是，用能釐訂法制，奠民治之初基，宣達與情，樹憲政之丕模，上月杪受命組織新閣，深荷諸同仁之同意，惟念病患之軀，難勝艱鉅之任，經一再懇辭，未獲允准，惟有克盡棉薄，勉力以赴，茲於新閣業吿組成，科原任本院院長一席，謹特辭去，所冀今後兩院之問相需相成，切合無間，本羣策軍力之義，收戡亂建國之功，斯不僅科一人馨香禱祝已也，此致立法院全體委員公鑒，孫科拜啓」。</p>
<p>〔本報甫京廿三日電〕立法院正副院長出任政府官員，遺職將由立委重行互選，茲悉孫科，陳立夫兩氏離職事，廿四日例會中將提出報告，互選日期，亦將由會中決定。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕綜合軍方人士對目前淮北戰局沉寂所作分析云：淮北戰地計有三個戰鬥區，其、一雙堆集地區，劉伯承陳賡圍擊黃維兵團，業於十六日黃兵團突圍結束，劉陳部受損亦甚慘重，此兩匪部倘無補充，決不易再行南攻；其二在蕭永間靑龍集地區圍困杜聿明所率邱李兵團之陳毅匪部，迄今已廿三天，亦未能吃掉此二大兵團，且以攻堅受折甚重，今日戰地雖為連續四天之惡劣低雲所龍罩，空軍及民航隊仍然出動空投糧食彈藥，予杜兵團以支援，有杜兵團存在，陳毅主力日在消耗，決無南竄之力，其三為阻李延年兵團北上之匪，並未因雙堆集戰役結束而獲得劉陳之增援，南攻自談不到。綜觀淮北前綫，由於劉陳無力南進而顯沉寂態勢，將延續至新年年關前後。淮北綫東端五河盱眙雖為不穩區域，但較之蘇北遍受土共騷擾之區並無太甚，陸軍部隊日來在風雪泥濘侵困下，仍堅守碉堡，幷馳騁搜剿，不稍懈怠。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕國防部今發表十六日至廿二日一週戰局如下：（一）華北戰塲：自東北林彪匪部竄入關內後，我華北國軍卽及時作嚴密部署，將兵力集中於平津及張垣一帶，養精蓄銳，準備予犯匪以痛殲。開自十四日起，在平市西郊發動試探性竄擾後，國軍即於十六十七兩日主動派隊出擊，十七一日間，即在城西北萬壽寺·紅菓園·白石橋附近斃傷匪第五縱隊一千七百餘人。另路向平東南馬馭橋出擊國軍，自晨迄午，亦斃傷匪第八縱隊二千餘。南苑國軍，曾將偷襲機塲之匪三百餘全部殲滅。此後平郊即大體平靜，戰事僅限於零星接觸，惟匪軍於夜間用大砲向古城盲目發射，以擴大其動搖人心之神經戰，阜城門內大後坑·小弓匠營·東弓匠營一帶，有居民數人受傷，平市民衆對匪軍之不顧人道，盲目發砲，無不痛恨。連日我砲兵與空軍協同發揮威力，匪砲已被壓制，刻平郊十五公里以內，無匪主力部隊。</p>
<p>匪犯平郊不逞，乃於二十日晨起，向我天津東北大畢莊，宜興埠，及西北天齊廟一帶進犯，國軍當予迎頭痛擊，激戰至下午二時，匪以損失重大，全綫退縮，匪被殲達二千餘。竄犯塘沽以西新河之匪，亦被我軍擊退，匪傷亡在千名以上，入晚匪糾衆再犯，經各綫國軍猛烈反擊，匪不支後退，又斃傷匪一千五百餘。二十一日津北仍有戰鬥，惟匪數次攻勢均被國軍擊退，僅有匪一小部竄擾軍糧城以南地區。刻以平津市內機塲已趕築完成，空運卽可恢復、民心士氣較前益為振奮。</p>
<p>（二）華東戰塲：蚌宿會戰，自十一月廿六日開始，迄十二月十六日，我黃維，李延年兩兵團會師，恰為廿日。在此廿日中，我黃維兵團以宿縣西南之雙堆集，大營集為基點，於北淝河，澮河間，吸住劉匪第一·三，四·六·十等縱隊，及陳賡匪第九縱隊等十餘萬人，使其無法脫離戰塲，李兵團係於越過包家集後，繼而進入方店子，與自雙堆集出擊之黃維兵團相會，首先擊敗匪的深壕陣地，而與李兵團先頭握手的，便是胡璉將軍和另一路的第十八師長尹俊將軍所部戰士。我黃維兵團苦戰兼旬，雖有若干損失，但與匪軍相較，匪傷亡尤較我為重，刻蒙城渦湯一帶亘百里之村莊，到處均住有傷兵，我忠勇官兵之犧牲，可謂已獲得甚大之代價，自黃李兩兵團會師後，匪軍大部卽紛紛後撤整補，近日以天候陰雨，各綫均沉寂，國軍除另作完密部署，再謀予匪以致命的打擊外，幷另以有力部隊，肅淸淝澥兩河間之殘匪後，向固鎮蒙城方面分途進擊，以策應在永城宿縣間與匪鏖戰達半月之杜聿明南下兵團。截至目前為止，在蚌宿會戰期間二十天當中，我共斃傷匪已十五萬九千餘人，俘匪七千二百六十餘人，陳劉匪部遭此打擊，除在豫東，皖北，蘇北一帶拉丁征伕，亟謀補充外，並將膠東豫西北各地民兵，軍區部隊，都調來編入被打垮的各縱隊之內，刻所有豫東的蒙城，渦陽和洪澤湖以北的各縣，都駐滿匪方傷兵，故短期內決沒有大舉蠢動力量。同時，我調守江淮之强大國軍新部署，卽將完成。</p>

<p>—論東條等戰犯的絞决</p>
<p>東京麥帥總部廿三日晨宣佈：日本甲級戰犯東條英機，土肥原賢二，廣田弘毅，板坦征四郎，木村兵太郎，松井石根，武籘章七名，巳於廿三日零時到零時卅五分間在巢鴨監獄內全部絞決。麥克阿瑟元帥特別邀謂盟總日本管制委員會中的蘇中美澳等國代表到塲觀刑，中國商震將軍亦與其列。消息傳來後，舉世興奮，尤其是遭受日本軍閥侵略荼毒八年的中國人民，接獲這一消息以後，深深呼吸了一口新鮮空氣。毫無疑義的，這是一九四八年的一件大事，正說明了人間世的眞理，在曲折憂息中，最後的勝利仍屬眞理。遠東國際法庭檢察官季楠在華府宣稱：希望日本七戰犯的絞決，能為國際洗禁止侵略戰的開始。誠然，東條等之死，我們一致認為是暴力之死，是强權之死，是侵略之死；其歷史意義之重大，萬分值得人類的珍視的。</p>
<p>第一，東條等之絞決，說明了人間世正義的伸張，公理的不滅。東京裁判的國際法庭組織，大於紐倫堡審判，時間的消耗在兩年以上，耗費美金達二千萬元，提出證書五五九七件，出席證人四三五人，紀錄達五萬頁以上，均較紐倫堡審判完備而充實。今年四月十六日審訊完畢休庭，對於宜判日期，從預定六週，一直拖了七個月，到十一月十三日，纔宣判東條等七名絞刑，荒木等十六名無期徒刑，重光葵等一名有期徒刑。這其間的曲折與拖延，重重發生，述我國法官梅汝璈也承認此種牛步蝸行的審判，幾已失去了政治意義。十一月廿四日麥帥核准了上項判決，一般人估計絞刑不久當可執行，不料新的曲折又發生，土肥原等的美籍辯護律師，竟於十一月二十九日，為廣田土肥原向美國最高法院上訴，要求將彼等釋放；尤其意想不到的，最高法院接受了上訴，準備作新的容判。畢世輿論，為之譁然，一致不滿意於美國最高法院接受本案的上訴，甚至麥帥也感到驚異。終於美高法院本月廿日以六票對一票，決定駁回日本戰犯的上訴。於是麥帥便以迅雷的方法，於廿三日晨絞決了此七名罪大惡極的戰犯。這件事的曲折與紆迥，說明了暴力者偷生的可恥，他們想在各種空隙中苟全性命，逃脫正義的審判，公理的懲罰，然而他們罪無可逭，一切可恥的努力，終於失敗了，終於破滅了。今天的人間，正是暴力與正義交戰，强權與正氣交戰的人間，二十三日晨曦中出現的剎那光芒，表徵了人間正義的伸張，公理的不滅。</p>
<p>第二，美高洗院斷然駁回日本戰犯的上訴，說明了美國法律的神聖尊嚴。法律是信仰輿論的。當戰犯辯護律師向美高法院提出上訴時，他們的上訴理由說，麥帥無權成立判決他們的軍事法庭，並論任何美國立法機關或國際法皆未規定侵略罪。他們聲明軍事法庭如決定重審，則他們不擬出席美高法院。這很顯然的希望美高法院判決本案的重審，而竟圖推翻遠東團際軍事法處的判決。廣田土肥原二人提出上項上訴後，因美高法院接受了上訴，於是島田繁太郎·岡敬純·佐藤賢了·東鄉茂德·木戶幸一等，也均先後提出上訴，幾使神聖的判決為之搖動。際此緊要的最後的關頭，如果美高法院一念之差，則千秋之恨將無可補償，整個正義的歷史復將毀去，人間將從此失去光亮了。舉世的輿論，包括美政府的意識在內，一致屹立起來，制止美高法院此一錯覺。美高法院二十日終以投票表決的方式，駁回了日本戰犯的上訴。美高法院接受上訴，本係一種錯誤，而這種錯誤立即糾正，這完全說明美國法律的神聖尊嚴，值得贊美的。至於舉世輿論的淸新有力，抑壓强權，反抗暴力，制裁侵略，其精神永遠是存在的，是與非的觀念是牢不可破的。我們願望人間的法律，隨日月的流轉，永遠是淸新有力的，從法律的力量發皇為政治的道德的力量，永遠懲罰暴力，抵抗强權，制裁侵略，使一切暴力者，强權者，侵略者，在人間公道是非之前，完全毀滅，完全死去。</p>

<p>〔中央社巴黎廿二日電〕印尼代表今日下午於安理會會議中，為印尼共和國辯護稱：「此乃第二珍珠港事件」，渠並指責安理會無行動表現，此無異鼓勵荷方決定採取軍事行動。印尼代表指控荷蘭以刑罰加諸共和國人，並窒壓共和國之經濟。印尼問題非為戰爭之威脅，而係實際之戰爭，渠籲請安理會，卽致力吏戰爭停止，否則戰爭將延綿甚多年，以至印尼重自荷方奪獲自由為止。渠並要求荷方釋放拘禁之印尼閣員，印尼代表且請安理會在印尼調解會外採取行動，以該會處於孤立地位，殊難完成和平解決爭端之任務。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國行劉副總裁攻芸，於昨日午後五時宣佈：午後接獲政院指示，以存兌金銀辦法有待改善，為維持地方秩序，保障人民安全起見，現行存兌辦法，暫行停止。國行當局接獲此項全國性之停兌指示後，卽根據本市實際情形，在停兌運兌之間，週詳老慮，以兌金羣衆竚立竟夜，如立卽宣佈停兌，勢必引起秩序問題，故決定臨時加發一借以上之申請書，實行趕兌，至午後四時停發。昨日本市各承辦行莊原定共發申請書一萬份，結果發至二萬七千份以上，僅國行一處卽發出九千份。政院雖已發出停兌命令，但本市昨日已發之申請書，仍一律照兌。國行發出之九千份申請書，分十日處理完畢，每日兌申請書號碼之末尾一字，其次序為：十二月廿四日兌「〇」，廿五日兌「九」，廿七日兌「八」，廿八日兌「七」，廿九日兌「六」，三十日兌「五」，三十一日兌「四」，明年一月五日兌「三」，六日兌「二」，七日兌「一」。其餘中交農民郵匯局合作金庫五處發出之申請書，定五日內處理完畢，每日兌換兩號，其程序為：廿四日兌「〇九」，廿五日兌「八七」，廿七日兌「六五」，廿八日兌「四三」，廿九日兌「二一」。</p>

<p>外灘人山人海　中區斷絕交通　情况混亂空前</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市申請存兌金銀之擁擠混亂，為歷來所未有。自前晚九時起，至昨日正午為止，　集外灘一隅擠兌之市民，在五萬人以上。雖經治安當局全力維持秩序，混亂中卽有多人死傷。當時情形之嚴重，迫使當局不得不電請財部補救，至午後四時停兌令下，申請工作能循序完成，未肇更重大事端，尙屬不幸中之幸。</p>
<p>自前晚九時起，外灘各行局前，卽已人山人海，雖經保警隊及騎巡隊再三驅散，但因大利所在，至午夜時羣衆仍冒雨集合。至上午二時左右，治安人員盡全力將擠兌羣衆之主力，驅至蘇州河以北，而將各橋頭嚴密扼守，但少數零星隊伍，仍設法匿於各大厦及浦江小舟上。迨宵禁一過，各承辦行局前，均排隊至密不通風，人聲鼎沸，附近交通全受妨碍。上午九時至十一時，四川路上，南京路至福州路一段，全部被擠兌羣衆　斷。此外自外灘至山東路四川路之附近地區，亦均人頭攢動，交通阻塞，所有各類車輛，臨時均奉命繞道而行。</p>
<p>八瞎子組小隊　意然亦來擠兌</p>
<p>擠兌羣衆內，不少為自郊區遠道趕來，鵠候通宵，擬一覩央行配給黃金眞面目者。甚至本市赫德路有瞎子市民八人，竟集成小隊，趕來擠兌，上海灘上之黃金熱，至是已達最高峯。在此人潮汹湧之際，婦孺及體力較弱者，不堪擠壓，因而仆地而致踐踏斃侖老，計有七人，受塲赴醫院治療，有名可查者五十餘人，輕微傷而自行離去者，不計其數。警局之機動車大隊騎巡大隊，保警總隊，以及聯合糾察隊，皆竟日出動。　局長叔平亦親自到塲，全力指揮維持秩序。至正午時，申請行列之秩序，始漸見好轉。看熟鬧之羣衆已被驅散，排隊之行列亦依次領取申請書。同時銀行為適應環境起見，臨時決定增發申請書一萬七千份。</p>
<p>羣衆迄晚不散　滿地殘破衣履</p>
<p>迄晚間五時許，若干承辦行局前之羣衆，尙擁擠未散，在數處熱鬧之擠兌中心地點，破碎之雨衣雨鞋，拋棄之雨傘什物，狼藉滿地，由淸道夫整車掃除。據記者之觀察，獲得官價配金之幸運者，實為少數。其餘擠兌者均為得不償失。除精神及身體上之苦痛不計外，隨身衣物之損失，價值卽往往超過一兩黃金　市　　　　　　。</p>
<p>又迄昨晚為止，已查出擠兌市民中，輕傷之五十人，重傷之兩人，均赴仁濟醫院治療，其他尙待調查。踐踏致死者七人，其姓名住址如下：徐貴餘（廿九歲早寗人住蘭州路四〇一號），阮鴻洲（廿九歲紹興人住南市白衣街勝鳳里二號），周志高（卅歲海門人住寗波路二八四弄四號），孫富財（卅五歲鎮江人住方浜中路花草街四四弄七號），王士方（卅歲奉化人住徐鎮路二三七弄卅二號），程文照（卅歲寗波人住中正南二路四〇九弄B五號），卞文英（卅歲高郵人住觀音閣五九弄二號）。</p>

<p>財部核定辦法實際仍有窒礙　金融過度限制有失增資意義</p>
<p>市商會前電財政部，請將行莊增資之現金股款，於騐資完畢後，仍予發還後，昨舉財部電復，現巳由部核定，行莊增資現款，仍應依照規定，存儲中央銀行三個月。惟為適應事實需要起見，該項繳存資金，除得按商營銀行調整資本後動用繳存資本金辦法第三條所規定之用途，呈請動用外，凡承做合於銀行法規定之抵押放款，定期在一個月以上者，得向央行申請動用。如承做農工礦生產，及公用交通事業貸款，並准專案呈部核准動用等情。商會以上項變通辦法，按諸實際，仍有窒礙。特再電呈財部，仍請將行莊增資現款，免予凍結。</p>
<p>原電云：查商業銀行調整資本辦法第五條之限制，原包括全國之銀行錢莊信託公司而言，範圍至為廣泛。鈞部准將一個月之抵押放款，動用增資現款，雖已較原訂商業銀行存儲資本動用辦法，放寬尺度。但按諸實際，仍有窒礙。因（一）近來行莊放款，多則五日七日，少則一日兩日，從無定期至一個月以上者。雖有放寬尺度之名，而事實上仍無所補。（二）錢莊向注重於信用放款，銀行法為錢莊特立專章，信用放款限度，定為占資金總額百分之五十，且批發商與門售商之貸款，其貨物重在隨出隨進，流通迅速，儲存於店內之貨品，事實上亦無從作為抵押。錢莊深入民問，為中小型商業所樂就者，關鍵在此。現舊歷年關在邇，如果增資現款，須承做一個月以上之抵押放款，始可動用，商業週轉，更感困難。（三）管制金融，應有一定限度，行莊貸放，如溢出於銀行法規定範圍之外，依法自有取締專條。如果層層鈴制，非移存國家銀行，經過事前呈准，不能動用，則國家之對於金融業，失其融通資金，輔助工商之效力，且有失增資之意義。求諸中外，恐鮮其例。鈞座對於此等不合理之科條，似應呈明行政院，予以摧陷廓淸，庶該業能盡其調劃市面之責任。除本案已由銀錢信託三公會以亥刪代電續呈外，謹就該公會等未盡之意，引伸如上，仰祈採納施行，實為公便。</p>

<h3 id="e1">President Sun Explains Policy Guidelines: Self-Reliance to Maintain National Survival; War is Not Unilaterally Abandoned; Military Force Still Seeks Peace; Improving Systems to Reduce People's Suffering <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] President Sun, in his first address to the Executive Yuan meeting after taking office, stated the following:</p>
<p>My appointment as President of the Executive Yuan is akin to being drafted into military service. At this critical stage of national hardship, many important and difficult national problems urgently need to be resolved. Only by braving dangers and difficulties, and humbly accepting this arduous task, can I hope that my colleagues will be of one heart and mind, working together for the country to overcome difficulties, sharing the President's burdens, and reversing this difficult situation.</p>
<p>The suppression of the rebellion is currently at a crucial stage. The government's ultimate goal in using military force is to strive for peace. Whether it was the war of resistance against foreign aggression in the past or the current use of force internally, the goal remains the same. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the government made efforts to pursue peace. Because peace could not be achieved, it was compelled to use force. The ultimate goal of using force is still to seek the restoration of peace. However, war is a matter for both sides and cannot be unilaterally abandoned. The government cannot rely on foreign forces to support its internal affairs. Maintaining the survival of the nation requires its own conditions. At this stage, how to strengthen the government's power and maintain national survival is something we should all focus our efforts on, carefully plan, and strive to achieve.</p>
<p>Speaking of diplomacy, China's international environment is more complex and turbulent than it was three years ago. After the War of Resistance, due to the failure to achieve peaceful unification domestically, it has been impossible to focus on construction. China's declining international status is also far worse than it was three years ago. China's national policy has always been to coexist peacefully with any country in the world. For existing friendships, we will strive to strengthen them. If there are misunderstandings, we are also willing to work hard to resolve them amicably. This is the spirit of our nation and the basic principle of our diplomacy. It has been so in the past, and it will continue to be so in the future.</p>
<p>Because of the eight years of the War of Resistance against foreign aggression and the three years of internal turmoil, the people are impoverished, and resources are exhausted, productivity has declined sharply, and the nation's vitality has been severely damaged. During the period of military conflict, the national treasury's expenditures were enormous, leading to currency instability and rising prices. Everyone has experienced this vicious cycle. In addition, there are many aspects of the currently used laws and systems that urgently need to be improved. For example, the conscription system of the past ten years or more, which was used to support the eight-year war, did achieve considerable results. However, as it has been continued for a long time, the misconduct of personnel and the unreasonableness of the methods have intensified, the burden on the people has become heavy, and the country has not benefited much. In the future, in terms of administration, this system should be carefully reviewed and effectively improved to reduce the burden and suffering of the people.</p>
<p>As for financial problems, the root lies in the social economy. Although it is difficult to expect domestic agricultural and industrial production to increase, at least we cannot let it decline further. Only then can the sources of revenue on which the country's survival depends have a foundation. Otherwise, finance and the economy will inevitably worsen together. Therefore, rewarding and assisting the development of agriculture, industry, and mining should be the most urgent task of national governance in the future.</p>
<p>In terms of local administration, there are also many unreasonable phenomena. In the past, the government focused on establishing a system, such as the accounting and auditing systems and the procedures for handling official documents. The trivial drawbacks often made administrative procedures cumbersome, stagnant, and delayed, greatly reducing efficiency. These must be improved. In the past, local government officials generally felt that the central government was too centralized, and everything had to be decided by the central government. Sometimes, requests were made but no response was received for a long time, resulting in delays in important matters. This centralized system may be sustainable in normal times, but in extraordinary situations, many local problems must be resolved on the spot to adapt to the situation and not miss opportunities. In recent years, foreign public opinion has often expressed dissatisfaction with Chinese politics, mainly due to personnel corruption and political inefficiency. Orders from higher-level governments cannot be implemented at the lower levels, forming a phenomenon of concealment between superiors and subordinates. These accusations are not entirely fabricated. Because of these various problems, the country is in its current difficult situation. In the future, we must do our best to frankly correct and boldly improve. Only with progress in politics can the country have vitality. However, these problems cannot be solved by the President of the Executive Yuan alone. Therefore, I must sincerely ask all my colleagues to make a joint decision and strive to shoulder their responsibilities to solve all the urgent problems of today. This is what I deeply hope for.</p>
<h3 id="e2">President Sun Officially Takes Office; Presides Over First Government Affairs Meeting; Minister of Education Mei Yi-qi Still Firmly Declining <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, officially took office on the morning of the 23rd. When the ministers of various departments and commission members arrived one after another at 9:30 a.m., Legislative Yuan members, Supervisory Yuan members, and National Assembly representatives in Nanjing also went to offer their congratulations. After Sun arrived, he immediately held a handover ceremony with the Weng cabinet. Weng went to Shanghai on business and was represented by former Secretary-General Li Weiguo, who handled the handover matters with Sun. Thus, the first cabinet after the implementation of the Constitution officially transferred to the second cabinet. The formalities were extremely simple. Immediately afterward, the first government affairs meeting was held. Sun made a report similar to an explanation of the major policies, clarifying the tasks of the current cabinet. After the report, routine cases were discussed, and cases such as the appointment of Teng Jie as the Mayor of Beijing were passed. The meeting then adjourned. At noon, Sun hosted a banquet for all cabinet members at the No. 1 official residence of the Executive Yuan to show solidarity.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Most of the newly appointed ministers of various departments of the Executive Yuan will take office and begin their duties on the 27th, except for a few who will take office within a day or two. The candidates for deputy ministers of various departments and deputy chairmen of various committees have not yet been fully decided. However, since Minister of Education Mei Yi-qi is still firmly declining the position, and the ministry's affairs need to be handled, his political deputy will be announced soon, with Chen Xueping appointed to act on behalf of the minister. It is also learned that the new candidate for the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan has not yet been finalized. All duties have been temporarily entrusted to former Deputy Secretary-General Liang Yingwen for assistance, but Liang has indicated that this will be limited to two weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Wang Shijie May Be Appointed Ambassador to Britain <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Wu Tiecheng, who concurrently serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, will arrive at the ministry within days to take over his duties. Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie has been handling official duties as usual in recent days, preparing for the handover. Regarding the direction of the new cabinet's foreign policy, relevant parties here are mostly adopting a reserved attitude and refraining from speculation. Some say that Minister Wu's concurrent position is temporary and that there will not be any major changes for the time being. The final decision will be made after a full-time Minister of Foreign Affairs is officially appointed, the matter is discussed and drafted by the Executive Yuan, and it is submitted to the President for approval. As for the rumors in Beijing that former Minister Wang will be appointed as ambassador to Britain, people close to him say that it is not entirely impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Sun Ke's Resignation Letter Delivered to the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Sun Ke's letter of resignation as President of the Legislative Yuan was delivered to the Secretariat of the Yuan on the 23rd and will be presented for report at the 31st Yuan meeting on the 24th. The original text of the resignation letter is as follows: "Respectfully, I, Sun Ke, have been in charge of the affairs of the Legislative Yuan for seventeen years. This summer, with the implementation of constitutional government, the Yuan was reorganized, and I was able to gather with my colleagues again to jointly plan the country's affairs, thereby establishing laws and systems, laying the foundation for the initial stage of democracy, conveying public sentiment, and establishing a model for constitutional government. At the end of last month, I was ordered to organize a new cabinet, deeply grateful for the consent of my colleagues. However, considering my ailing body, I fear I cannot withstand the arduous task and have repeatedly requested to resign, but my request has not been granted. I can only do my best and strive to fulfill my duties. Now that the new cabinet has been formed, I hereby resign from my original position as President of this Yuan. I hope that the two Yuans will need each other, complement each other, and work together seamlessly, adhering to the principle of collective wisdom and effort, and achieving the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. This is not only my sincere prayer. Respectfully submitted to all members of the Legislative Yuan for your consideration, Sun Ke."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] With the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan taking positions as government officials, the vacant positions will be filled by the Legislative Yuan members re-electing each other.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] There will be new developments in the war situation around Tianjin. According to an announcement by the Political Warfare Department of the Garrison Headquarters on the evening of the 23rd: The main force of Lin Biao's 8th Column in Yixingbu and the northeastern area of Hanjia Village north of Tianjin launched a fierce assault on our forces at 10 p.m. on the 22nd. After four hours of fierce fighting, they retreated entirely to the northeast. The 10th Column of Lin Biao's forces in the area east of Dongjuzi east of Tianjin, feeling threatened by the retreat of the main force of the 8th Column, also hastily crossed the sea and retreated to the southeast, leaving behind a large number of heavy weapons and supplies, which are being cleared by our side.

<h3 id="e14">The Communist Bandits in Northern Huai Have No Strength to Flee South; National Army Du Yuming's Troops Launch Offensive <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] A comprehensive analysis by military personnel of the current quiet war situation in northern Huai states that the northern Huai battlefield has three combat zones. First, in the Shuangduiji area, Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng encircled Huang Wei's corps. Huang's corps ended its breakout on the 16th. Liu and Chen's forces also suffered severe losses. If these two bandit units are not replenished, it will be difficult for them to launch another southern attack. Second, Chen Yi's bandit forces besieged the Qiu and Li corps led by Du Yuming in the Qinglongji area between Xiao and Yong. It has been 23 days since then, and they have not been able to eliminate these two major corps. Moreover, they have suffered heavy losses in attacking fortifications. Although the battlefield has been shrouded in continuous bad low clouds for four days, the air force and civil aviation team still dispatched food and ammunition by air, supporting Du's corps. With the existence of Du's corps, Chen Yi's main force is being consumed daily and has no strength to flee south. Third, the bandits who are blocking Li Yannian's corps from going north have not received reinforcements from Liu and Chen after the end of the Shuangduiji battle. A southern attack is out of the question. Looking at the northern Huai front as a whole, the quiet situation due to Liu and Chen's inability to advance south will continue until around the New Year. Although Wuhe and Xuyi on the eastern end of the northern Huai line are unstable areas, they are not as severely harassed by local communists as the areas in northern Jiangsu. Army troops have been firmly defending bunkers and rushing to search and suppress them under the intrusion of wind, snow, and mud in recent days without the slightest slackening.</p>

Open ports are absolutely prohibited from navigation outside of 7:00 am to 5:00 pm. This plan will be implemented within days.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Ministry of National Defense today announced the weekly war situation from the 16th to the 22nd as follows: (1) North China Battlefield: Since Lin Biao's bandit forces from the Northeast sneaked into Guannei, our national army in North China has made timely and strict deployments, concentrating its forces in the Beiping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou areas to build up strength and prepare to inflict heavy damage on the attacking bandits. Since the 14th, after launching tentative harassment in the western suburbs of Beiping, the national army took the initiative to send teams to attack on the 16th and 17th. On the 17th alone, it killed or wounded more than 1,700 bandits from the 5th Column near Wanshou Temple, Hongguoyuan, and Baishiqiao in the northwest of the city. Another national army force that attacked Mayuqiao in the southeast of Beiping also killed or wounded more than 2,000 bandits from the 8th Column from morning to noon. The national army in Nanyuan annihilated all 300 bandits who sneaked into the airport. Since then, the suburbs of Beiping have been generally peaceful, and the fighting has been limited to sporadic contact. However, the bandit army blindly fired artillery at the ancient city at night to expand its psychological warfare to shake people's hearts. Several residents were injured in the Dagou, Xiaogongjiangying, and Donggongjiangying areas inside Fuchengmen. The Beiping people were all resentful of the bandit army's inhumanity and blind shelling. In recent days, our artillery and air force have coordinated to exert their power, and the bandit artillery has been suppressed. Currently, there are no main bandit forces within 15 kilometers of the suburbs of Beiping.</p>
<p>Failing to succeed in attacking the suburbs of Beiping, the bandits launched an attack on the morning of the 20th on Dabizhuang, Yixingbu in the northeast of Tianjin, and Tianqimiao in the northwest. The national army gave them a head-on blow, and the bandits retreated across the board after suffering heavy losses in the fierce fighting until 2 p.m. The bandits were wiped out up to more than 2,000. The bandits who sneaked into Xinhe, west of Tanggu, were also repelled by our army, with more than 1,000 bandits killed or wounded. In the evening, the bandits gathered again to attack, and after fierce counterattacks by the national army on all fronts, the bandits could not support and retreated, killing or wounding another 1,500 bandits. There was still fighting in northern Tianjin on the 21st, but the bandit offensives were repelled by the national army several times. Only a small group of bandits harassed the area south of Junliangcheng. Now that the airports in the cities of Beiping and Tianjin have been completed, air transport can be restored, and the morale of the people is more uplifted than before.</p>
<p>(2) East China Battlefield: The Bengbu-Su County Battle, which began on November 26th, lasted until December 16th, when our Huang Wei and Li Yannian corps met, exactly 20 days. During these 20 days, our Huang Wei Corps used Shuangduiji and Dayingji southwest of Su County as bases, absorbing more than 100,000 bandits from Liu's 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 10th Columns, and Chen Geng's 9th Column between the Bei Fei River and the Hui River, making it impossible for them to escape the battlefield. Li's corps entered Fangdianzi after crossing Baojiaji, and met with Huang Wei's corps attacking from Shuangduiji. The first to defeat the bandit's deep trench positions and shake hands with the vanguard of Li's corps were General Hu Lian and the soldiers of the 18th Division led by General Yin Jun. Our Huang Wei Corps fought hard for more than ten days. Although there were some losses, the bandit casualties were even heavier than ours compared with the bandit army. At present, villages stretching for hundreds of miles around Mengcheng and Woyang are filled with wounded soldiers. It can be said that the sacrifices of our loyal and brave officers and soldiers have been greatly rewarded. After the meeting of the Huang and Li corps, most of the bandit army retreated one after another to reorganize. Recently, due to cloudy and rainy weather, all lines have been quiet. In addition to making perfect deployments and seeking to give the bandits a fatal blow, the national army is also using powerful troops to clear the remaining bandits between the Fei and Hai rivers before launching an offensive towards Guzhen and Mengcheng to coordinate with the southern army of Du Yuming, which has been fighting fiercely with the bandits for half a month between Yongcheng and Su County. As of now, during the 20 days of the Bengbu-Su County Battle, we have killed or wounded more than 159,000 bandits and captured more than 7,260 bandits. The Chen and Liu bandit forces, after being hit by this, are frantically seeking replenishment by pulling up conscripts in Yubei, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. They are also transferring militia and military region troops from Jiaodong and northwestern Yubei to incorporate them into the defeated columns. Currently, all counties in Yubei, such as Mengcheng, Woyang, and those north of Hongze Lake, are filled with wounded bandit soldiers, so there will be no major rash actions in the short term. At the same time, the new deployment of our powerful national army defending Jianghuai is about to be completed.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Editorial: Upholding Justice, Truth Endures <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>—On the Execution by Hanging of War Criminals Like Tojo</p>
<p>Tokyo, MacArthur Headquarters, 23rd morning announced: Japanese Class A war criminals Tojo Hideki, Doihara Kenji, Hirota Koki, Itagaki Seishiro, Kimura Heitaro, Matsui Iwane, and Umezu Yoshijiro, seven in total, were all executed by hanging between 00:00 and 00:35 on the 23rd at Sugamo Prison. General MacArthur specially invited representatives from the Allied Control Council for Japan, including those from the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and Australia, to attend the execution. Chinese General Shang Zhen was also among them. Upon receiving this news, the world was thrilled, especially the Chinese people who suffered eight years of invasion and devastation under the Japanese militarists, who breathed a deep sigh of relief. Without a doubt, this is a major event of 1948, a clear indication that the truth of the human world, despite twists and turns, ultimately triumphs. Robert E. Kintner, the chief prosecutor for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, stated in Washington D.C.: He hoped the hanging of the seven Japanese war criminals would mark the beginning of an international ban on wars of aggression. Indeed, we unanimously believe that the death of Tojo and others is the death of violence, the death of might, and the death of aggression; its historical significance is profoundly worthy of human cherishment.</p>
<p>First, the hanging of Tojo and others demonstrates the upholding of justice and the enduring nature of truth in the human world. The organization of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo was larger than the Nuremberg trials, lasting more than two years and costing 20 million US dollars. It presented 5,597 pieces of evidence, heard 435 witnesses, and compiled over 50,000 pages of records, all more comprehensive and substantial than the Nuremberg trials. The trial concluded on April 16th, and the court adjourned. The date for sentencing, initially scheduled for six weeks, was delayed for seven months until November 13th, when Tojo and six others were sentenced to death by hanging, Araki and sixteen others were sentenced to life imprisonment, and Shigemitsu Mamoru and one other were sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term. During this period, there were numerous twists and delays. Our country's judge, Mei Ru'ao, also acknowledged that this slow and sluggish trial had almost lost its political significance. On November 24th, MacArthur approved the above verdict, and it was generally estimated that the execution would be carried out soon. However, new twists occurred. The American defense lawyers for Doihara and others appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on November 29th, requesting their release. Unexpectedly, the Supreme Court accepted the appeal and prepared for a new review. Public opinion was in an uproar, unanimously dissatisfied with the U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the case, and even MacArthur was surprised. Finally, on the 20th of this month, the U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of six to one, decided to reject the appeal of the Japanese war criminals. Thereupon, MacArthur, with swiftness, executed these seven heinous war criminals by hanging on the morning of the 23rd. The twists and turns of this event demonstrate the shameful attempts of the violent to survive; they sought to preserve their lives through various loopholes, escaping the judgment of justice and the punishment of truth. However, their crimes were unforgivable, and all their shameful efforts ultimately failed and were shattered. Today's world is one where violence and justice, might and righteousness clash. The moment of light that appeared in the dawn of the 23rd symbolizes the upholding of justice and the enduring nature of truth in the human world.</p>
<p>Second, the U.S. Supreme Court's decisive rejection of the appeal of the Japanese war criminals demonstrates the sacred dignity of American law. Law is the belief and opinion of the public. When the war criminals' defense lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, their reasons stated that MacArthur had no authority to establish a military tribunal to judge them and that no American legislative body or international law stipulated the crime of aggression. They declared that if the military tribunal decided to retry the case, they did not intend to attend the U.S. Supreme Court. This clearly hoped that the U.S. Supreme Court would rule for a retrial of the case and even attempt to overturn the verdict of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. After Hirota and Doihara filed the above appeals, Shimada Shigetaro, Oka Takasumi, Sato Kenryo, Togo Shigenori, Kido Koichi, and others also successively filed appeals, nearly shaking the sacred verdict. At this critical and final moment, if the U.S. Supreme Court had made a misjudgment, the regrets of a thousand autumns would have been irreparable, the entire history of justice would have been destroyed, and the world would have lost its light. World public opinion, including the consciousness of the U.S. government, stood up unanimously to prevent this misperception of the U.S. Supreme Court. On the 20th, the U.S. Supreme Court finally rejected the appeal of the Japanese war criminals through a vote. The U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the appeal was initially a mistake, but this mistake was immediately corrected, which fully demonstrates the sacred dignity of American law, worthy of praise. As for the clear and powerful global public opinion, suppressing might, resisting violence, and punishing aggression, its spirit will forever exist, and the concept of right and wrong is unbreakable. We wish that the laws of the human world, with the passage of time, will always be clear and powerful, developing from the power of law into the power of political morality, forever punishing violence, resisting might, and punishing aggression, so that all those who use violence, those who wield power, and those who commit aggression will be completely destroyed and completely die before the fairness and justice of the human world.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Political Affairs Meeting Decides: Temporary Suspension of Gold and Silver Exchange; Deposit and Exchange Policy Remains Unchanged, Separate Improved Measures to Be Devised <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Due to deposit exchanges for gold and silver, runs on banks have occurred in various places, and deaths have resulted from people being crushed. In order to maintain local order and protect the safety of the people, the Executive Yuan decided on the 23rd to instruct the Central Bank to temporarily suspend exchanges from today onwards and to devise separate improved measures. On the 23rd, during the first political affairs meeting of the new Executive Yuan, Premier Sun received a long-distance call from Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, reporting that the exchange of gold and silver had caused chaotic order in Shanghai, resulting in the deaths of several people being crushed, and requesting instructions on how to handle the situation. After Premier Sun reported this to the political affairs meeting, it was decided that the policy of deposit exchanges for gold and silver would remain unchanged, but in order to avoid runs on banks and prevent further loss of life, exchanges would be temporarily suspended. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to work with the Central Bank to draft proper measures before resuming deposit exchanges. After the political affairs meeting adjourned, Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun immediately notified Central Bank branches in various locations that all current deposit and exchange measures would be temporarily suspended until the new measures were announced.</p>

<p>Han Civilians Receive 5,000 Taels of Tibetan Silver; Tibetan Authorities Receive British-Leftover Supplies from India</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 23rd] A person who arrived from the west bank of the Jinsha River discussed recent developments in Tibet: (1) Kalon Lhalu of Qamdo performed Tibetan opera for ten days at Longwangtang, hosting a banquet for all Tibetan officials and chieftains in Qamdo. Chinese civilians residing there were also invited to perform Peking opera, a rare occurrence in recent decades for the Tibetan side. Lhalu also gifted the Chinese civilians 5,000 taels of Tibetan silver, ten bricks of tea, and ten bags of Tsampa, marking the first friendly gesture since the Regent Taktra Rinpoche assumed power. (2) The Tibetan authorities have received surplus wartime supplies left by the British in India, costing only 600,000 rupees, which will be paid in installments at a low interest rate without collateral. Yuto and Artillery Chief Xu Zhenla were dispatched to India to handle the matter. (3) The Lancang River Iron Chain Bridge, a vital transportation route for Chinese and Tibetan merchants, has been completed at a cost of over 15,000 silver dollars. (4) Recently, there was an incident in Tibet where militiamen revolted against nobles. After the removal of the 12th Daiben Kagde Ben, a radical faction of the Tibetan army, his son was sent to Kongjo to handle the aftermath. When a Tibetan soldier did not remove his hat as a sign of respect, Kagzi (Kalon's son) whipped the soldier to death, causing public outrage among all the soldiers, who tied up Kagzi and sent him to Qamdo Gaxag for punishment. (5) The India-Tibet highway has been extended northeast from Sadiya to Walong. Additionally, the Sadiya to Myitkyina section is now passable by vehicles.</p>

<p>Two Dead, Two Injured; Case Complicated</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] Yesterday, a murder case resulting in two deaths and two injuries occurred in Nanxie Village, Mudu. Coffin maker Lü Genquan sold five shi of grain soil due to gambling debts, leading to an argument with his wife, Lü Quanjin. In a drunken rage, he used a sharp axe to kill his mother-in-law, Lü Yunbao. He then repeatedly slashed his wife sixteen times, leaving her life in critical condition. His younger sister-in-law, Qiu Yuan, sustained minor injuries. Afterwards, he fatally stabbed himself in the throat with an iron chisel. It is rumored that this was a crime of passion, as Lü had learned that his mother-in-law and wife were both having affairs with a tailor, leading him to commit the heinous act. However, there was a bloody handprint on the screen wall outside the house, and a clump of cotton yarn stained with blood was found in the grass across the river. The case appears to be extremely complicated, and the police bureau is currently investigating.</p>

The passage after "perhaps the rise of all prices after the war" at the end of the seventh line of the "Diet" subheading in the third column of the article "The Lives of the British People" is actually the full text of the article "Hong Kong Organizes Defense Force" from the fifty-seventh line onwards until the end (the "Hardship" subheading).

<p>(4) Regarding Western medicines, there are 2,763 boxes, totaling 188 varieties. Key and large quantity medicines are excerpted as follows: (1) Cod liver oil: 19,002 bottles, (2) Cod liver oil essence: 8,148 bottles, (3) Cod liver oil essence pills: 13,390 bottles, (4) Xiaofa Da Jing pills: 13,164 bottles, (5) Xiaofa Wei Jing pills: 48 bottles, (6) Xiaofa Suppository pills: 2,618 bottles, (7) Xiaofa Pidings pills: 872 bottles, (8) Glucose calcium injection: 3,623 bottles, (9) Glucose injection: 11,628 bottles, (10) Glucose calcium tablets: 302 bottles, (11) Multivitamins: 16,378 bottles, (12) Vitamin: 2,403 bottles, (13) Daily vitamin pills: 2,160 bottles, (14) Weixin injection: 2,722 tubes, (15) Weixin tablets: 5,679 bottles, (16) Weikang pills: 4,020 bottles, (17) Weimaike completed: 7,379 bottles, (18) Ultraviolet fat: 7,712 bottles, (19) Vitamin phosphate pills: 982 bottles, (20) Vitamin mineral pills: 6,408 bottles, (21) Vitamin mineral tablets: 2,054 bottles, (22) Weipei tablets: 4,800 bottles, (23) Wheat germ oil pills: 600 bottles, (24) Yeast tablets: 3,641 bottles, (25) Yeast vitamin D tablets: 80,573 bottles, (26) Magnetic bottle quinine tablets: 48 bottles, (27) Qingna biscuit tablets: 140 bottles, (28) Calcium lactate tablets: 558 bottles, (29) Bita tablets: 1,431 bottles, (30) Compound white pine syrup: 219 gallons and 768 pints, (31) Wild cherry bark syrup: 119 gallons and 384 pints, (32) RXB syrup: 46,872 bottles, (33) Barbital tablets: 2,436 bottles, (34) Junluocaine injection: 1,020 bottles, (35) Sun Kelu tablets: 5,040 bottles.</p>
<p>(5) There are 44 other types of goods, and the ones with large quantities are also excerpted as follows: (1) Printing press: 28 boxes, (2) Cement pipe manufacturing machines: 30 boxes, (3) Syringes: 1,265, (4) Carbon paper: 19 boxes, (5) Printing ink: 25 boxes, (6) Paper clips: 780 reams, (7) Bicycle wheels: 914, (8) Bicycles: 9 boxes (6 bicycles per box), (9) Large cardboard for walls: 191 and a half boxes and 211 sheets, (10) Suits: 44, (11) Ties: 1,187, (12) Wool socks: 98, (13) Counterweight: 298 pieces, (14) Sewing thread: 1 box, (15) Wireless light bulbs: 2 boxes.</p>
<p>During the investigation of the above items, discrepancies were found. For example, 1,167 pairs of women's shorts listed in the original table were not found. It was pointed out that they were glass combs with 15,994 dozens. It was claimed that the women's shorts had been sent to the company for sale but were not recorded, and the glass combs were inadvertently omitted. The original report listed 38 barrels plus 379 pounds of gold powder, but the current stock is 32 barrels and 379 pounds. It was claimed that six barrels had been sold after the report was filed. There were also 44 summer clothes packed in a large wooden box that Zhu failed to report. In addition, some items listed by Song were identified as goods in storage or shared warehouses. On the second floor of the Li Han Company, there were six large wooden boxes, each over ten feet long, containing thick glass panels, which were said to be stored by Xiangji Company. There were 24 machine pedal cars packed in 24 wooden boxes, which were said to be stored by Zhongxing Automobile Factory. Inside the Datongwan Road warehouse, there were 245 rolls of white newsprint 35 inches wide and 89 rolls 70 inches wide, which were said to belong to the Dalu News. There were also 283 rolls of white newsprint (21.5 inches) wide, 109 rolls 31.5 inches wide, and 74 rolls 13 inches wide, which were identified as belonging to the Shishi News. At that time, no evidence was presented to prove that the so-called stored items or shared warehouses were indeed stored or co-owned by all parties.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is difficult to understand the truth of whether the import of goods is legal, whether there is concealment, and whether there are cases of swapping labels, because the company did not submit the goods in/out ledgers and all important documents for review. However, even with this cursory verification, there are still major problems. For example, a batch of glass raincoats, glass toothbrushes, glass handbags, and silk summer clothes, which were prohibited from import, was reported to have been imported on May 22 this year. However, checking the tax payment customs declaration number, it was found that they were another batch of the same goods imported in July and August of the thirty-fifth year. For goods that are temporarily not allowed to be imported, 744 silk raincoats were reported to have been imported on May 23 this year, but the tax receipt number was verified to be another batch of the same goods imported on August 8 of the thirty-fifth year. 306 fountain pens were also another batch of the same goods imported on August 1 of the thirty-fifth year. In addition, 6 boxes of wool fabrics imported on July 25 of the thirty-sixth year, 994 insurance razors imported on October 26, and 1,983 pairs of rubber shoes imported on December 15, were verified to be another batch of the same goods imported on November 4, September 15, and October 31 of the thirty-sixth year. This is only with regard to goods that are prohibited or temporarily not allowed to be imported. As for other items such as DDT powder, the customs declaration only shows 48 barrels, while the company reported 70 barrels. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e33">We Support the U.S. Proposal in the Security Council to Order the Netherlands to Cease Fire and Withdraw Troops; Australian Representative Vehemently Argues for Expelling the Netherlands from the United Nations; The Soviet Union May Demand Sanctions <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 23rd Broadcast: Seven member states of the United Nations, namely China, the United States, India, the Philippines, Australia, the Soviet Union, and Syria, unanimously condemned the Netherlands' actions in Indonesia. Soviet Representative Malik demanded that the Security Council condemn the Netherlands' aggression against Indonesia as a threat to international peace. Australian Representative Hodgson proposed amending the U.S. proposal in the Security Council to demand that the Dutch government immediately release Indonesian leaders. At the Security Council meeting in the afternoon, Syrian Representative Curry formally introduced the amendment.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Soviet Representative Malik is scheduled to speak in the Security Council on the 23rd. According to those familiar with the Soviet Union's attitude, if the Soviet Union proposes a draft resolution, it will likely classify the Netherlands' offensive as a threat to peace and may even demand sanctions against the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Australian Representative Hodgson today asked the Security Council to expel the Netherlands from the United Nations unless the Netherlands ceases its attacks on the Indonesian Republic. Today is the second day of the Security Council's discussion of the Indonesian issue. Chinese Representative Hsia Chin-lin was the first to declare his support for the proposal made yesterday by U.S. Representative Jessup to order the Netherlands to cease fire and withdraw troops immediately. Colombia and Syria also expressed their support. Hodgson also echoed this proposal, but with a more vehement attitude. It is said that Article 25 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that any member state should accept and implement the orders of the Security Council, but the Netherlands has blatantly torn up the Security Council's ceasefire order, and the only way for the Security Council to deal with it is to expel the Netherlands from the United Nations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] U.S. Representative Jessup today requested the United Nations Security Council to order a ceasefire in Indonesia, with the Dutch troops returning to their original defense positions, and for the United Nations Mediation Committee to investigate the responsibility for initiating the conflict. Jessup clearly announced: "The U.S. government cannot condone any excuse for the resumption of hostilities in Indonesia." The Mediation Committee's report has pointed out six Dutch offenses, including violating the ceasefire agreement and issuing an ultimatum to Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The Indonesian representative today defended the Indonesian Republic at the Security Council meeting this afternoon, stating: "This is the second Pearl Harbor incident." He also criticized the Security Council for not taking action, which is tantamount to encouraging the Dutch to decide to take military action. The Indonesian representative accused the Netherlands of imposing penalties on the people of the Republic and suppressing the Republic's economy. The Indonesian issue is not a threat of war, but an actual war. He urged the Security Council to work to stop the war immediately, otherwise the war will continue for many years until Indonesia regains its freedom from the Netherlands. He also requested that the Netherlands release the detained Indonesian ministers. The Indonesian representative also requested the Security Council to take action outside of the Indonesian Mediation Committee, as the committee is in an isolated position and it is difficult to complete the task of peacefully resolving the dispute.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Well-informed sources said on the 23rd that the administration is carefully considering suspending all aid to the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan as a further action to force the Dutch troops to withdraw from Indonesia. The Economic Cooperation Administration had already announced on the 21st that it would suspend the Marshall Plan aid to the Dutch East Indies pending clarification of the situation in Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Soemitro Djojohadikoesoemo, declared at a press conference on the 22nd that the United States' refusal to allocate economic aid funds to the Dutch East Indies is a full expression of the U.S. attitude. Mr. Soemitro said: "I hope that the Economic Cooperation Administration will also suspend all allocations to the Netherlands in the same way." Without the funds of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the Netherlands will not be able to maintain its current military operations in the East Indies. He said: "I personally urged Mr. Lovett to suspend all allocations to the Netherlands during the meeting."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The firm attitude of the United States towards the conflict in Indonesia has made the French suspect whether the United States has now changed its overall policy of dealing with communism.

The hanging began at 00:01 midnight and ended in 33 minutes. The corpses were all transported in US military trucks, escorted by US military police in jeeps to Yokohama. Before 7:45 AM, each corpse was placed in accordance with American rituals, and at 7:45 AM they were sent to the Yokohama Municipal Crematorium. The cremation began at 8:10 AM and was completed at 9:30 AM. The ashes were divided into seven small black boxes, and were carried out of the crematorium by seven jeeps for scattering.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Execution</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Tojo and seven other war criminals were hanged in great secrecy before dawn today. The American representative of the Allied Council for Japan Control, Mr. Shepherd, General Shang Zhen, the Chinese representative, Mr. Badrick, the British representative, and Mr. Trevianko, the Soviet representative, all personally attended the execution. Journalists were not allowed to enter. The criminals were executed in two batches. The first batch consisted of former Prime Minister Tojo, instigator of the invasion of China, Doihara, former commander of the Japanese army in Central China, Matsui, and former commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines, Mutō. They were led into the execution ground by duty officers from Sugamo Prison, followed by a pastor and a monk, each with two American soldiers watching on the left and right, and two officers bringing up the rear. After the four criminals entered the execution ground in single file, the executing officer verified their identities, and then they stepped onto the thirteen-step gallows. After the four criminals were on the gallows, they turned to face the monitoring officers sent by MacArthur. Journalists were not allowed to attend. Black hoods were placed over the heads of the four criminals, and ropes were put around their necks. At that time, the criminals remained silent. Then the executing commander issued an order. The four gallows were raised simultaneously. Doihara died at 7 minutes and 30 seconds after midnight, Tojo died at 10 minutes and 30 seconds after midnight, and Mutō and Matsui died at 11 minutes and 30 seconds and 13 minutes after midnight, respectively. The second batch of three hanged criminals entered the execution ground six minutes after Matsui's death. The three criminals, former Army Chief Itagaki, former Prime Minister Hirota, and former commander of the Kwantung Army, Kimura, were hanged at 20 minutes after midnight. All seven criminals were wearing US military green prison uniforms.</p>
<p>Shouting "Banzai" Three Times Before Death</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Reverend Geizan Chitoshi, who performed the religious ceremony for Tojo and others, said that the seven men shouted "Long live the Emperor and Great Japan" three times each, led by Matsui Ishigen and Itagaki respectively, as they walked towards the gallows. Before their execution, Doihara, Matsui, and Itagaki said they hoped that their deaths would improve relations between China and Japan. Before his death, Doihara recited a short poem, "Dear Chinese People", expressing regret for his past actions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo] Tojo left behind two letters, one to his family and one to the world, roughly stating his reasons for the war of aggression. Tojo also bequeathed his tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, false teeth, and Buddhist beads to his wife. Before his execution, he requested a final Japanese meal, and his request was granted. The other six ate US military rations.</p>
<p>National Day of Prayer</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 23rd] According to palace officials, Emperor Hirohito spent the entire day alone in his brown study in the palace today.

According to the evening newspaper Tokyo Shimbun, Hirohito joined the people of the nation today in a prayer for the maintenance of peace.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The Japanese government's supplementary budget for this year was passed by both houses last night at 11:00 PM after the opposition parties in the House of Representatives jointly proposed amendments.

<h3 id="e46">Chaotic Order of Deposit and Exchange, Ordered to Suspend Temporarily, Awaiting Central Government Improvement Measures, Those Who Received Application Forms to Be Cashed Starting Today <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Mr. Liu, Vice President of the National Bank, announced at 5:00 PM yesterday: He received instructions from the Executive Yuan this afternoon that the method of depositing and exchanging gold and silver needs to be improved. In order to maintain local order and protect the safety of the people, the current deposit and exchange method will be temporarily suspended. After receiving this nationwide suspension of exchange instructions, the National Bank authorities carefully considered the actual situation in the city between suspending the exchange and transporting the exchange. As the gold exchange crowds stood all night, if the suspension of exchange was announced immediately, it would inevitably cause order problems. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily issue application forms for one loan or more to expedite the exchange until the issuance stopped at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Yesterday, the various contracting banks and firms in the city originally planned to issue a total of 10,000 application forms, but more than 27,000 application forms were issued. The National Bank alone issued 9,000. Although the Executive Yuan has issued a suspension of exchange order, the application forms issued in the city yesterday will still be cashed. The 9,000 application forms issued by the National Bank will be processed in ten days. The last digit of the application form number will be exchanged each day, in the following order: December 24 will exchange "0", December 25 will exchange "9", December 27 will exchange "8", December 28 will exchange "7", December 29 will exchange "6", December 30 will exchange "5", December 31 will exchange "4", January 5 next year will exchange "3", 6 will exchange "2", and 7 will exchange "1". The application forms issued by the other five places, namely China Communications, Farmers Bank, Postal Remittance Bureau, and Cooperative Bank, will be processed in five days. Two numbers will be exchanged each day, in the following order: December 24 will exchange "09", December 25 will exchange "87", December 27 will exchange "65", December 28 will exchange "43", and December 29 will exchange "21".</p>
<p>In response to reporters' inquiries, Mr. Liu said: Regarding the deaths and injuries caused by the run on the bank, and other aftermath matters related to the deposit and exchange, it is thought that the government will have appropriate measures. He also said that today he visited the front of the various exchange banks and bureaus several times and witnessed the chaotic situation. Under this situation, bloody tragedies could have occurred. If criminals took advantage of the chaos, the situation would be even more unimaginable. He privately thought it was lucky that they were able to get through this. The Executive Yuan already had a plan to improve the deposit and exchange methods. Today, after learning about the chaotic situation in Shanghai's gold exchange, it decided to temporarily suspend the exchange. However, the amount of gold and silver exchanged so far only accounts for a very small portion of the government's holdings, so the deposit and exchange business will continue.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The person in charge of the police station gave the following statement last night on the police station's efforts to maintain order during the people's run on gold: (1) Because the locations of the various exchange banks were concentrated in one place, the people rushing to exchange began gathering in groups along the Bund before 9:00 PM the night before. The number of people gathered increased, and the bureau dispatched security police, mounted patrol teams, and mobile team police to disperse them. It was not until about 1:00 AM yesterday morning that order was restored. (2) After 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the people rushed to the front of the various banks again, with the number of people reaching more than 100,000. At this time, the bureau dispatched more than 1,600 police officers. As a result of the strenuous efforts to maintain order, some people rushing to exchange had the unfortunate experience of being squeezed and suffocated. In addition to the police officers on the spot rescuing them and rushing them to the hospital for treatment, dozens of people were revived after receiving artificial respiration. (3) Among the people injured yesterday, in addition to seven people who died due to excessive sweating and physical exhaustion, only Bao Caide, Wen Laifa, and Xu Yuanqing were hospitalized for treatment, and the rest have returned home.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Gold Bars Have Different Fineness, Mint Issues Statement, Cast As Received, No Additional Allocation <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the fineness of the gold bars produced by the Central Mint, the factory issued the following statement yesterday: "The gold bars produced by our factory are directly manufactured from gold bricks or miscellaneous gold delivered by the Central Bank, and no additional fineness is allocated. If the fineness of the gold bars received is high, the fineness of the gold bars produced will also be high. If the fineness of the gold bars received is low, the fineness of the gold bars produced will also be low. The difference in the color of the gold bars is actually caused by the different fineness of various miscellaneous gold. When it was first produced in mid-November, the Central Bank delivered gold bricks, the fineness of which was between 995.0 and 997.6. Our factory produced them batch by batch with the original fineness. Starting from November 29, the Central Bank delivered miscellaneous gold. As of now, after melting, the fineness of the samples extracted for chemical testing is 966.0 at the lowest. Our factory produces according to the original fineness, and the gold bars produced are marked with the fineness of the chemical testing. The Central Bank exchanges them according to the weight of pure gold contained, and the exchangers have no loss."</p>

<p>Seething Crowds on the Bund; Traffic Severed in the Central District; Unprecedented Chaos</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's crowds applying to exchange and deposit gold and silver in this city were unprecedented in history. From 9:00 PM the night before to noon yesterday, over 50,000 citizens gathered in one corner of the Bund to exchange currency. Despite the security authorities' best efforts to maintain order, many were killed and injured in the chaos. The severity of the situation forced the authorities to telegraph the Ministry of Finance for assistance. By 4:00 PM, when the order to suspend exchanges was issued, the application process was able to proceed in an orderly manner. It was fortunate that no more significant incidents occurred.</p>
<p>From 9:00 PM the night before, crowds had already gathered in front of various banks on the Bund. Despite repeated dispersal by the police and mounted patrol, the lure of profit led the masses to continue gathering in the rain until midnight. Around 2:00 AM, security personnel exerted all efforts to drive the main force of the exchange crowd north of the Suzhou Creek, closely guarding the bridgeheads. However, small scattered groups still managed to hide in major buildings and small boats on the Huangpu River. Once the curfew passed, lines in front of the handling banks were so dense that they were impassable, and the noise was deafening, obstructing all nearby traffic. From 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Sichuan Road, from Nanjing Road to Fuzhou Road, was completely cut off by the exchange crowd. Additionally, the area from the Bund to the vicinity of Shandong Road and Sichuan Road was filled with a sea of people, blocking traffic. All types of vehicles were temporarily ordered to detour.</p>
<p>A Squad of Eight Blind Men Joins the Rush</p>
<p>Among the exchange crowd, many had traveled from distant suburbs, waiting all night, eager to see the true face of the central bank's allocated gold. Even eight blind citizens from Hart Road in the city formed a squad and rushed to exchange currency. The gold fever in Shanghai had reached its peak. In this surging tide of people, women, children, and those with weaker physical constitutions were unable to withstand the pressure, falling to the ground and being trampled to death. Seven people were killed, and over fifty injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, with names recorded for them. Countless others sustained minor injuries and left on their own. The police bureau's motorized vehicle brigade, mounted patrol brigade, security police corps, and joint patrol teams were all mobilized throughout the day. Bureau Chief Shu Ping also personally arrived at the scene, directing and maintaining order with all his might. By noon, the order of the application queue began to improve gradually. Onlookers were dispersed, and those queuing were able to receive application forms in order. At the same time, to adapt to the situation, the bank temporarily decided to issue an additional 17,000 application forms.</p>
<p>Crowd Lingers Until Evening: Ground Covered in Torn Clothing and Shoes</p>
<p>Until about 5:00 PM, the crowds in front of several handling banks remained congested. At several bustling exchange centers, broken raincoats, rain boots, discarded umbrellas, and other items littered the ground, cleared away by sanitation workers in truckloads. According to the reporter's observations, only a few were fortunate enough to obtain gold at the official price. The rest of the exchangers gained nothing from their efforts. Apart from the mental and physical suffering, the value of lost personal belongings often exceeded the value of an ounce of gold in the market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as of last night, fifty slightly injured and two seriously injured exchange citizens have been identified and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, with further investigations pending. The names and addresses of the seven who died from being trampled are as follows: Xu Guiyu (29 years old, from Zaoning, residing at 401 Lanzhou Road), Ruan Hongzhou (29 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at 2 Shenglifeng Lane, Baiyi Street, Nanshi), Zhou Zhigao (30 years old, from Haimen, residing at 4, Lane 284, Ningbo Road), Sun Fucai (35 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at 7, Lane 44, Huacaogjie, Fangbang Middle Road), Wang Shifang (30 years old, from Fenghua, residing at 32, Lane 237, Xuzhen Road), Cheng Wenzhao (30 years old, from Ningbo, residing at B5, Lane 409, Zhongzheng South 2nd Road), Bian Wenying (30 years old, from Gaoyou, residing at 2, Lane 59, Guanyinge).</p>

<p>The New China College, established in October this year, is still holding classes at temporary school buildings on Wujin Road and West Beijing Road because the families of port command officers in the buildings on West Physical Education Road have not yet moved out. The college has been minimally affected by the current evacuation wave. Of the 650 students, only 38 have left the school to return to their hometowns. None of the 70-plus faculty and staff members have left Shanghai to relocate south. Despite financial difficulties, the college decided from the outset not to collect secondary tuition or teacher appreciation fees and will not grant an early holiday. The financial problem is being addressed by Director Pan Weigong in conjunction with capable directors, and the issue of regaining the school buildings is being handled by lawyers Wang Yigong and Yang Minhui, with a complete resolution expected in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to the difficult living conditions of teachers and staff in private primary and secondary schools in this city that have not collected secondary tuition fees, they previously submitted a request to the city's Education Bureau to negotiate low-interest loans with banks. The Education Bureau separately negotiated with nine banks, including the City Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, New China Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang First Bank, China Industrial Bank, Union Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and Mainland Bank. Each school's teacher or staff member can borrow 400 yuan, with interest halved from the market rate, for a term of two months. The school principal is responsible for repaying all principal and interest on time. The Education Bureau instructed each school to submit a list of teachers and staff members who need to borrow the money, in duplicate, along with a genuine security deposit, to the bureau for review. The application period ended at 5:00 PM on the 22nd, with a total of 235 schools and 2,266 teachers and staff members applying. However, because the total amount of loans is 700,000 yuan, and based on an allocation of 400 yuan per person, only 1,750 people can be loaned money. Therefore, the Education Bureau intends to remove 516 people from the list of applicants. The Education Bureau will notify the qualified applicants and then the banks, who will then notify each school to go through the loan procedures.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Banks and Money Shops Increase Capital, Pay Cash for Shares: City Chamber of Commerce Cables Again for Release <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Approved Measures Still Present Obstacles in Practice; Excessive Financial Restrictions Detract from the Meaning of Capital Increase</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the cash share payments for bank and money shop capital increases be returned after the capital verification was completed. The Ministry of Finance replied yesterday, stating that it has been approved by the Ministry that the cash for bank and money shop capital increases should still be deposited in the Central Bank for three months according to regulations. However, to adapt to actual needs, in addition to applying to use the deposited funds according to Article 3 of the measures for commercial banks to use the deposited capital after adjusting their capital, any mortgage loans that comply with the Banking Law and have a term of more than one month may apply to the Central Bank to use the funds. Loans for agricultural, industrial, mining production, and public transportation projects may also be approved by the Ministry on a case-by-case basis. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the above-mentioned alternative measures still present obstacles in practice and has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting that the cash for bank and money shop capital increases be exempted from freezing.</p>
<p>The original telegram stated: The restrictions in Article 5 of the measures for commercial banks to adjust their capital originally included banks, money shops, and trust companies nationwide, with a very wide scope. Although your Ministry has allowed mortgage loans with a term of one month or more to use the increased capital, which is a relaxation of the original measures for commercial banks to deposit and use capital, it still presents obstacles in practice. This is because: (1) In recent years, bank and money shop loans have often been for five to seven days, or even one to two days, with no loans having a term of more than one month. Although it is called a relaxation, it does not actually help. (2) Money shops have always focused on credit loans. The Banking Law has a special chapter for money shops, setting the limit for credit loans at 50% of the total capital. For loans to wholesalers and retailers, the goods are mainly quickly circulated, and the goods stored in the store cannot actually be used as collateral. This is the key to why money shops are popular with small and medium-sized businesses. With the Lunar New Year approaching, if the increased capital must be used for mortgage loans with a term of more than one month to be used, commercial turnover will be even more difficult. (3) Financial control should have a certain limit. If bank and money shop loans exceed the scope prescribed by the Banking Law, there are special regulations for punishment according to law. If there are multiple layers of control, and they cannot be used unless they are transferred to the National Bank and approved in advance, then the state will lose its effectiveness in facilitating funds and assisting industry and commerce for the financial industry and will detract from the meaning of capital increase. This is probably unprecedented in China and abroad. Your Excellency should report to the Executive Yuan and eliminate these unreasonable articles, so that the industry can fulfill its responsibility of adjusting market conditions. In addition to this case being continued by the three guilds of banks, money shops, and trusts in a telegram, I respectfully extend the unfulfilled intentions of the guilds as above, hoping that they will be adopted and implemented, which is truly convenient for the public.</p>

<p>Recently, hot money from various parts of North China has flocked to Shanghai, and the way this money arrives is mostly in cash. This is the biggest reason for the recent abundant funds and loose money supply in Shanghai. According to authoritative sources, the large influx of northern capital into Shanghai is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market money supply continued to show signs of looseness and excess. Both those within and outside the industry were universally bullish. Although the demand for funds was slightly stronger, it did not affect the trend. The market interbank lending rate remained between 12 yuan and 15 yuan. It is said that from now until the end of the Gregorian calendar year, there are many seekers for funds, and the interbank lending rate has been shouted up to 20 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Collection of Salt Tax Based on Value to Reach One Billion This Year <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>According to the Bureau of Commodity Tax: The method of collecting salt tax based on quantity ("從量征稅") has now been decided to be changed to collection based on value ("從價征稅"). Adjustments will be made monthly according to the price standards of goods. It is reported that in the future, areas with high salt prices will have their salt tax reduced as much as possible, while areas with low salt prices will have it slightly increased. It is expected that after the method of collecting salt tax is changed, the collection of salt tax can be strengthened more than before. The income from salt tax this year can be increased to more than one billion gold yuan.</p>
