<h3>印大使館祈禱會　伊斯麥代辦宣讀紀念詞</h3>
<p>「吾人願循彼前進之路達目的地」　〔本報南京卅一日電〕記者於下午五時往訪印使館，見大廳之中，梅農大使夫人，方領導輓歌之試唱，伊斯麥代辦及梅農之秘書均面帶市憂，以低沉語音，對渠等偉大之國父，遭此大故，悼念不已。六時許，在京印人齊集使館大廳，男女約八十餘人，率跣足趺坐，大廳正面設長案，供奉甘地身披白衫之油畫像，像前燒紅燭一對，白燭五支，首藉無錢電收音機收聽德里廣播。至六時半，（德里時間下午四時）即甘地遺體火葬典禮開始之際，開始追悼祈禱會，先是，四人相繼起立，至案右誦經，繼由伊斯麥代辦讀紀念詞，略謂：「昨日乃印度史乘中最黑暗之時日，今日禡哈瑪吉（甘地之名）之遺體將還歸大地，禡哈瑪吉已逝去，將不再領導其祈禱儀式，此乃吾人不能置信者，然痛爲眞實，彼如不逝去，誠何幸事，彼尙遺偉業未竟，彼不在，吾人如於黑暗之中步履，願深知彼者繼其志，此非慰安，萬事若失。　「舉世均正爲之悲悼，唯　哈瑪吉之偉大，余亦不能揭露神秘，吾人僅得自其生活掠影中領取敎訓，彼每一呼吸，調寄眞理，每一字句，亦相諧不離，即使今日，彼如尙在此地，被詢以將欲何爲？彼亦必不爲此暗殺事件斷斷不釋，而只訓示吾人，繼其未竟之志願；吾人追隨彼燃點起之光明，循彼前進之路，直至渠終生不渝欲携吾人登臨之最後自的地」。</p>
<p>伊氏辭畢，全體肅立默哀。旋又由四人先後至靈案右側誦悼詞，或唱挽歌，並合十爲禮。最後，全體擊節齋唱挽歌一首，於莊穆之氛圍巾散會，時已八時半，屋外夜　更重，濕冷逼人，紅白綠三色綢質印度國旗，仍靜滯半懸於屋頂旗桿，旗正中所綴象徵甘地精神之索輪，亦爲黑暗所掩。</p>
<h3>滬各界震悼</h3>
<p>吳市長派沈宗濂　於印度領館吊唁　〔本報訊〕印度聖雄甘地被暴徒槍擊殞命之噩耗傳來，本市各界莫不震悼。昨日上午，吳市長代表沈宗濂，美總領卡勃脫，英副總領吉蘭特，希臘總領尤諾拉妥斯等，均赴印度領館吊唁。沈宗濂並發表悼詞稱：「甘地被刺，余及市府同人莫不震驚，甘地之死，深可遺憾，此不僅其家庭與印度之損失，亦爲整個世界之損失」。</p>
<h3>滬印僑追悼聖雄　昨今舉行誦經會</h3>
<p>各族人士捐棄成見參加</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市印僑爲追悼聖雄甘地，特於卅一日午後三時半，假　寳興路印度教堂內舉行誦經會。參與者除印度敎人外，回敎族錫克族派西等均能暫時捐棄成見，聚首一堂，禮拜此一生爲印度獨立奮鬥而殺身成仁之哲人。追悼會內所誦之經典，均爲甘地生前祈禱時所常唸者，禮檯之前，滿堆印度經典，上覆錦綢。在片刻沉默誌哀後，回敎徒起立高聲朗誦可關經，以追悼此信仰相異之偉人。與會之印僑，滲加時毫無組織，但不期而集者亦在五十人以上，印度某一土邦之薩彌爾公主亦在丙，面部表情，均哀戚而虔敬，間有流涕者。全部追悼儀式，至酋時半結束。</p>
<p>今晨九時，印度敎堂將再度舉行育經會，以表哀思。本市之印度商會，則將於明（二日）舉行正式之追悼會。中印文化協會，亦將於短期開會追悼，屆時本市各界人士均將參加。</p>
<h3>曾琦親撰聯拘　胡適致電弔唁</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕國府委員青年黨主席曾琦，病中聞甘地被刺消息，感傷不已，並親撰一聯云：「舉世仰猶龍，何物狂」徒狙至聖！獻身能飼虎，一生低首拜斯人。」曾氏向記者稱：渠對甘地備極崇拜，去年甘地生日曾交舊作「甘地傳跋」，用隸書寫贈甘地，由印度梅農大使轉致。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅一日電〕胡適卅一日電南京印度大使館弔唁甘地文曰：「對廿地的死，我衷心裏感覺哀痛，這對於印人民是無法補償的損失。」胡對記者說：「甘地的死，不致再增加印巴的科紛，可能因爲甘地偉大精神的感召而减輕消彌印巴的危機。」他說甘地是一種魔力，以他那麼瘦小無力，却領導印度走向獨立，但是也只有具有宗敎熱忱的民族，才能產生甘地；試問還有那一個政治家能以自己絕食作爲政治武器呢？中國無法產生甘地，二千年的孔孟學說，今天讀起來還和現在普通人說的話差不多，可以說入世得很，同印度哲人所討論的問題大不相同。最後，胡氏評論甘地非暴力主義的成功，在於盎格魯撒克遜民族的守法精神。</p>
<h3>北大印學生　昨舉行晚禱</h3>

<h3>所利得稅估繳制　事實上難再變更　　直接稅署負責人談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕卅七年度所利得稅採估繳制，按卅六年度之六倍估繳，滬商會已電請財部直接稅署請求重予考慮。據直接稅署負責人卅一日語記者，卅七年度所得得稅採估繳制辦法及按卅六年度六倍估繳，均已經國務會通過，事實上已無法再爲變更。依物價計算，今年物價較去年上漲約廿倍，商人之所得，自亦必隨物價增加，估繳按六倍計算，實已甚爲合理，依听利得稅之預算而論，卅六年爲九千餘億元，卅七年爲十一萬二千億元，亦增加十四倍左右，故按六倍估繳，決無法再少，現預計本年四月以前所利得稅之收入爲四萬五千億元，較本年半年所利得稅預算五萬六千億元已打相當折扣，甚盼商人能體念國家目前財政困難，予以贊助，弗使實行時發生阻得。據該負責人估計，如估繳制在滬能順利推行，僅上海一地即可收三萬億元，對减少發行，可有不少帮助。</p>

<h3>社論　甘地精神永生！</h3>
<p>年高七十八歲的印度精神領袖甘地先生，在一月三十日下午參加晚禱會途中過刺，身中三彈而殞命！甘地最後的發言是「上帝！上帝！」印度首相尼赫魯氏向全印人民廣播，宣布三十一日爲國喪日。</p>
<p>甘地先生，這一代的大聖，眼看印度的獨立，因不忍印回兩族分裂，爲了喀什米爾問題構成嫌隙與猜忌，發生戰亂與死亡，他不惜以一百二十一小時又四十五分鐘的絕食，戚召出印回兩族的和平。當人性恢復，獸性退避後十三天，不幸這一代的大聖竟過刺而死了，爲印度，爲人類，爲歷史，帶來了無比的災難和損失！甘地先生的死，可以追踪耶穌基督！</p>
<p>誰殺害了常代的大聖？是一個印度敎極端份子的暴徒。誰毀滅了和平的光輪？是一股泯絕良知的暴力。一九四八年一月卅日之夕，是印度，是人類，是歷史最黯淡無光的時刻；悲慘，　怖，無恥，充滿了這一時間。我們哭甘地，哀聖哲；我們願甘地先生聖潔的血，洗滌人間的仇恨與無恥，萬千人民的淚水，冲擊印度的紛亂與死亡。甘地先生突受狗擊之時，以手覆額，猶表示饒恕兇手的姿態，他雖死於這一個暴徒之手，但他的精神應該可以換來了千萬暴徒的懺悔。甘地先生爲印度的自由和平，成仁取義，也會含笑九泉，永生世界！</p>
<p>甘地先生是一位偉大的聖哲。他的生活，他的理想，他的信仰，允爲今世紀人類最高的道德標準。他誕生於一八六九年十月二日西印喀詩韋之首府坡培打。家本富有，而他一生則淡泊寗靜，堅苦卓絕，爲印度獨立解放而奮鬥，爲人類和平生存而吶喊。他雖爲印度敎徒，但他宗敎思想是博大的，他認爲他自己是上帝的工具。他這種思想，與釋迦和耶穌，並無一致。爲了要親近意境中的上帝，和促進人世間的和平唯一的方法是勿用暴力。爲了印度的獨立，他願犧牲他的一切，但他不願意採取暴力手段達到目的。他反對戰爭，反對侵略，因爲他相信人類不能以武力爲基礎而奠立和平。他見到了領導慾已經威脅世界和平，他自己都不願作印度政治的領袖，所以他是一位極端反對史太林的。他是聖哲而不是英雄。他是印度人精神的主宰，世界和平的光輪。他不是一個「權力」，也決不願以權力達到自己的目的。他的思想，他的作爲，基於民意。他是一位眞實的民主主義者；假如見到他自己主張不受民意支持時，他便立刻放棄它。它的奮鬥史，曾入獄三次，絕食十五次，遇刺四次，現在是他最後一次絕食之後遇刺而死。他的一生，反對死亡，而自己不畏死亡。他已先知暮年的體力日衰，生命像一隻殘燭，　他希望絕食不死，希望不滅，直活至一指距之久，而爲人類宣勞。</p>
<p>印度九大宗敎，多數人是崇敬甘地先生的。他成爲了印度一體的象徵。他一生入獄絕食，都爲印度獨立自由而奮鬥。他反對印回分治，當印度獨立實行分治後，甘地曾以智慧和追求眞理的誠心，願望印回不可分治。印度族和回族決定分洽了，甘地尊從民意，自己也就放棄了「成見」，其實是爲薪求和平而犧牲了眞理。喀什米爾問題發生，戰亂有蔓延全境的趨勢，分裂仇恨交響而來，這一代大聖悲傷無垠，他終於一月十三日開始了他最後的絕食。他說：「我必定要滿意的看到印度全國人民的心，重新團結一致，然後纔願停止絕食。假使我應該要死，那麼就　我死罷，與其眼看印度毀滅，還不如死去來得光榮。經過一百二十一小時父四十五分鐘，他大仁大勇大公大智的精神，終於在十八日那天感召了印度敎錫克敎及回敎諸領袖，一致在甘地先生「死亡之榻」前，傾聽這位老人微弱的溫暖的呼聲：「我在人世恐已不久，希望巴基斯坦能再與印度聯合」。他希望巴基斯坦放棄自治領地位，和印度重新合併一個國家。他希望印度各民族，和諧相處，共同生存，解放貧苦無告的人民，他反對尼赫魯政府將喀什米爾問題提送聯合國安理會，他阻止印度敎極端靑年的復仇思想。他每晚祈禱，號召印回人民和小團結。印度敎極端派反對他，所謂「反甘地運動」的遊行，和一月二十日晚禱會的一顆炸彈，便是這些暴徒對甘地先生的示威。甘地先生的生，反對使用暴力與流血，而自己却不畏暴力與流血，所以終於出現了一月三十日這悲痛的日子。暴徙們的凶頑，暴徒們的獸性，他們爲印度帶來了混亂和災禍，他們毀去了他們的「巴布」（父親之意），也就是毀去了他們應崇奉的最高道德標準。如果印回人民還不自覺，不以大公化大私，不以甘地的大仁大慈化除嫌隙與猜忌，今後必然爲印回帶來更大史慘的戰亂，要之，人性泯滅，獸性復活，一塲瘋狂慘殺，，千代怨仇相報，全印度將要陸沉了！這是什麼時代？</p>
<p>我們哭甘地先生，哭當代大聖。我們不願印度歷史遭過這悲慘命運。我們希望甘地先生被刺後孟買的暴動能立叩平息。我們希望印回兩族的領補和政治家，在甘地先生血腥的屍體下傾流懺梅的淚水，在這大聖光輪萬丈之前，祈禱和平團結，大家眞摯地伸出血腥的手來，實踐這偉大聖哲的遺言，重新合作，不要分裂。如　印同的領袖和政治家，有遠見，有良知，能反省，能懺悔，則甘地先生之死，拯救了印度之死，甘地先牛之流血，代替了印回千萬人的流血。常那靑年的兇手槍擊甘地先生時，那老人垂亡的聲音向他說：「你來得太遲了！」我們以爲這反動的暴力，正義之賊，就在這一時刻就擒，在此一時刻之後，印度的和平團結果能迅速實現，則不算太遲，不算太遠。</p>
<p>甘地先生的精神是印度的精神，也是人類的精神。他之生，象徵印度和平，象徵人類和平。他無比的偉大力量和道德標準，應該永遠爲印度的精神，人類的精神，印度和平的象徵，人類和平的象徵。這一代大聖的光輪，從血泊中放射出無垠的光芒，照耀於世界人類。願一切的魔鬼，一切的民族仇恨，在這和平老人的靈魂之前，永遠　退下去，永遠消失下去。</p>
<p>我們祈禱：甘地先生精神不死，甘地先生精神永生！</p>

<h3>「軍民協力剿除共匪」　白部長對全國在鄉軍官廣播</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口卅一日電〕國防部長白祟禧，今晚八時四十五分在漢對全國在鄉軍官廣播，題爲「軍民協力剿除共匪」，原詞如次；</p>
<p>全國在鄉軍官同袍們：此次崇禧奉命督剿大別山區共匪，並承命在繳匪期間，對豫鄂皖贛湘五省民衆自衛組訓，兼負指導之責，深感任大責重，因軍務纏身，不能分赴各地，向各在鄉軍官袍澤們面致慰問，今天特藉此機會，說明個人對各位袍澤的期望。回溯過去北伐，</p>
<p>光榮歷史　回溯過去北伐，</p>
<p>我國民革命軍以兵員不及十萬，槍械不足五萬且多窳劣，我全體將士深受三民主義之感召，發揮革命精神，爲實仃主義，完成革命而奮鬥，在最高統帥領導之下，前伏後繼，奮厲無前，終能以少勝衆，打倒軍閥百餘萬反革命勢力，此在革命過程中，實爲光輝燦爛之史蹟。比及抗戰軍興，尤賴我忠勇將士，服從最高統帥命令，擁護抗戰國策，以劣勢裝備，對抗擾勢裝備的敵人，一心一德，犧牲奮鬥，塵戰八年，終能協同盟軍，擊溃共同敵人，爭取最後光榮的勝利，取消了近百年來不平等條約，使我國際地位得以提高從北伐抗戰這種堅苦卓絕的成就，固然是無數已死先烈頭顱熱血戰爭取得無上的代價，也是我們後死的抱澤們過去努力奮鬥，一番不朽的成果，而且是對於國家盡忠，對民族盡孝，以及對世界人類的和平，盡到最偉大的貢獻，於此，我們對已死者先烈應表虔誠的悼念，對百戰餘生的忠勇抱澤，表示無上的敬意。</p>
<p>戡亂剿匪　本來，八年艱苦的抗戰，獲得勝利之後，國家可以從事復員建設，軍民可以獲得生息休養，乃共匪挾其非法武力，四處擾亂，違反軍令政令，破壤和平統一，使我復員建國工作橫受阻撓。八年抗戰之後，各地同胞脫離了敵僞的壓迫，又重遭共匪姦在虐殺，蹂躪搶刦，其禍國殃民之罪行，暴露無遺，終且公然全面叛亂，其野心即在顛覆國民政府，斷送國家民族。中央爲維護國家的統一，拯救匪區水深火熱中的同胞，不能不採取軍事行動，實施戡亂剿匪，自去年七月政府頒佈總動員令後，已明白表示勘亂剿匪的決心，在此目標之下，我們必須以剿匪軍事爲第一，動員一切人力財力物力，實施時體制，發揮總動員的力量，來　除萬息·因爲剿匪單憑軍事的力量，擊溃匪的主力，仍不能澈底澄淸，必須政治，軍事，經濟，文化緊密配合，軍隊與民衆協同一致，全面動員起來，形成整個的戰鬥體，才能發揮整體的力量，使用全面戰術，爭取廣大面的控制，使匪無立足生存之地，才能根絕匪患。</p>
<p>組訓民眾　爲使政治緊密配合軍事，自然要以軍事的力量來掩護政治，同時要以政治力量健全基層，來協助軍事，而當前剿匪惟一急務，即在普遍動員民衆，建立地方自衛武力，配合國軍，協力淸剿，中央最近曾頒佈各縣市民衆自衛對組訓規程，便是針對現實剿匪需要的一抓措施，其中對於民衆自衛編組訓練，武器彈藥經費的籌措，均有明白具體規定。</p>
<p>目前我們要實施民衆組訓，建立地方自衛武力，一個主要的問題，即是馴　幹部，我認為戡亂動匪已是義無反顯，每個民衆都應一致動員，來保衛生命財產，同時更希望我各在鄉軍官報効鄉土，盡忠國家。</p>
<p>担任基幹　各在鄉軍官具備軍人精神紀律，在過去北伐抗戰，著有勳勞，身經百戰，皆屬忠勇之士，當此剿匪時期，本愛鄉愛國之誼，即照規定組織在鄉軍官會，協助地方，担任民衆組訓的基幹。凡參加自衛隊工作者，其待遇除由地方補助主副食外，並決定由國防部自木年一月起，按月發給退役俸，交由各省政府或各級管區按時轉發，俾維持生活，安心工作。至於不在自衛隊任職之在鄉軍官，仍照原規定，每年分兩期發給退役俸，望我各地在鄉軍官一致奮起，踴躍投效，在各省保安司令領導之下，參加民衆組訓工作，使地方自衛武力迅速建立，配合國軍，進行淸剿，安定地方，這是崇禧對我忠勇愛國在鄉軍官的期望，切盼各忠勇袍澤乘時奮起，共同完成戡亂的任務。</p>

<h3>遠東委員會主席　重申美對日政策</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三十日電〕遠東委員會主席，即美代表麥柯伊爲最近報紙上刊有種種消息，旨在透露委會中所作若干抓討論之狀况，難免含義不確甚或完全失常者。特發表如下聲明：「本主席希望闡明一點，即遠東委會中並無任何會員國曾圖「阻止考慮」增加委員會會員國之問題，或共他任何建議。</p>
<p>關於解除日本武裝一節，猶如秘書長於去年七月向報界發表之報告中所闡明者，委員會就此項題目進行積極討論業已數月，以謀根據委員會基本政策協定之有關各節訂定原則。在進行此等討論時，各國代表曾隨時提出建議，此等建議，當然係反映各種不同之觀點者。關於此一問題，猶如對其他問題然，委員會中已不斷進行談判，以謀各盟國國獲致協議。本「主席以美代表之資格，曾于上星期向委會提出一項有關日本經濟之聲明，此項聲明後已予以公佈。即美國政府承認遠東委會及其會員國之合作，對於造成日本自給自足經濟計劃之順利完成，係屬必要。美國之對日政策無論政治的或經濟的，均已造成維持和平之條件爲目的。盟國經由遠東委員會實行合作，爲此稱政策之重要部份」。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三十日電〕遠東委會美代表麥考少將今斷然否認渠本人或委會任何其他代表，曾「阻碍考慮」最近蘇聯向委員會提出之各項建議。麥氏之聲明，係在答復今日所傳新近抵美之蘇駐美大使潘友新。業已發動「强列運動」，以限制麥克阿瑟在佔領日本政策方面之推行及要求繼續解除日本武裝之消息。麥氏在正式聲明中，軍申美支特遠東委會爲盟國合作之「主要部份」。並謂，最近報載關於遠東委會討論情形之消息，實有不正確及淆亂聽聞之暗示。但渠認一項報告爲例外，該報告稱，麥氏曾「阻碍」對蘇大使潘友新所提建議之表決。該建議主張應令麥克阿瑟於六個月內，拆除日本所有之軍事設備及同三個月內銷毀使日本軍事人員之軍事人事檔案。麥考承認委員會各代表之間，對解除日本武裝一點意見分歧，但渠指出主張雖有不向，但仍不失充分之友誼空氣。各代表間之私人關係仍極融洽。麥氏繼述及外傳蘇聯反對將巴基斯坦列為委會一員之事謂，委會中無一代表阻碍此一建議之考慮。犯者獲悉上述消息，係起源於遠東委會昨日舉行之每週例會。彼時蘇代表會提出關於解除日武裝之建議，請會議討論。據消息靈通人士稱，當時該建議曾引起通常之辯論，其中涉及美蘇意見互異之問題，但美蘇代表間從無衝突之事。結果對該問題未有決定或舉行表決。</p>

<p>〔路透社漢堡三十日電〕德境英國佔領區全部「白領」職員一百六十萬人，以彼等之糧食所給量不及勞工，決定於下星期二實一行廿四小時之罷工，以示抗議。</p>
<h3>日政府將大裁員</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京卅一日電〕日本內閣今宣稱：日政府決議在七月一日前解僱公務員二萬三千人，以推行緊縮政策。同時國營鐵道自二月十一日起價目加倍。裁員結果可在一九四八財政年度節省一億元，而火車新價則在二三月內增加政府收入二十億元。</p>

<p>〔路透社波那三十一日電〕孟買經昨日之暴動後，今日已較安定，全市公私機關及工廠商店一律停止活動一天，爲甘地誌哀。孟買中心四方呱之區域即昨日發生暴動之處，宵禁至今晨解除後尙未有事端。孟買中央弊局加派軍隊戒備，裝甲軍在全市各要道戒備，報紙均加黑邊，全印電台席播甘地殯葬消息，印度馬哈薩巴（印度敎政洽團體）前會長莎伐加之住宅，在孟買市北之許伐吉公園，千餘羣衆欲　前往搗毀爲軍驚所阻止。同時特別警察隊曾搜查印度敎軍事團體RSS之各辦公處，拘捕該組織之領袖若干，全市戒備今日益見加強，然仍有若干刺擊案發生。當地支持印度馬哈薩巴政策之報館一家爲羣衆蹤火焚毀，並阻止消防隊　救，警察曾事開槍制止。　　〔路透社印度柯爾哈坡邦柯爾哈坡城三十一日電〕印度馬哈薩巴領導人物之住宅及辦公室，今日遭大批羣衆搗毀焚燒刦掠，至下午一時局勢猶未好轉。　　〔聯合社孟買三十一日電〕甘地遇刺後，印回衝突又熾，昨夜單是孟買一地，即有十五人斃命，五十四人受傷。</p>
<h3>赫爾加快錄　北美報業聯合會版權所有</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>當我跨進國務院的門檻之時，拉丁美國諸共和國本身之間，就在進入一種游離狀態，此一事實，使西半球的惡劣情勢更見緊張。新世界（指南北美洲）中歷來最激烈的戰爭之一，即察科戰爭，正在巴拉圭和玻利維亞之間的荒山叢林中猛烈進行。哥倫比亞和秘魯已經發生了邊境衝突，頗有演成眞正戰爭的可能。此在古巴，馬却杜將軍（General　Gerardo　Machado）的獨栽政府在安度十二年之後，開始搖搖欲墜；革命在醞釀中</p>
<p>展開在我面前的，就是預定於年底在蒙吉維多舉行的泛美會議。這次會議早應在一九三二年十二月舉行，但當時由於西半球有效合作的希望是如此渺茫，決定延期一年。現在又有人一再講着再度延期了。</p>
<p>整個展望，惡劣已極，似乎，令人心灰意懶。因此，我明白，假如要實行羅斯福總統所倡導的善鄰政策，在西半球方面殊非易易。但是此項事實，也是一種挑戰，足以鼓起我們的勇氣。</p>
<p>早在三月四日以前，我就決定我們應付拉丁美洲的原則之一，應該恪守不干涉原則，像恪守宗敎上的信條一樣。</p>
<p>古巴的情勢，的確有使我們担憂的理由。已眾對馬却杜將軍的暴戾獨裁，憎恨益甚。除非馬却杜辭職，不然革命就會强迫他離開，此種情形，已經極爲明顯。炸彈案和槍擊案，在哈那伐層出不窮，糖廠和甘蔗田被焚燬，學校關門，而在一九三一年因革命未獲成功而遺留下來的游擊隊，正在山區活動。政治犯源源湧入美國·政治不安之外，還加上經濟艱難，其一部份原因，乃由美國的高關稅政策。整個局勢，千鈞一髮。</p>
<p>根據一九〇三年條約的所謂潑拉德修正案，美國具有干涉古巴的權利，以諜保全古巴的獨立，或者維持一個力足以保障生命，財產和個人自由的政府。但是總統和我決定我們決不干涉古巴的內政。我們雖有合法的權利，但是此種行動，適足使整個拉丁美洲對我國的關係更趨惡劣。它會推翻我們以前一切的不干涉聲明，並且會替我們傳統的敵人製造口舌，而我的希望，就是要使這輩敵人找不到藉口。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統和我同意以大使的資格遺派韋爾斯到古巴去，假如古巴各黨派表示願意的話，他可以用總統調停人的資格，努力斡旋。根據總統的建議以及我的贊同，韋爾斯於一九三三年四月六日被任命爲助理國務卿。他有良好的能力和經驗，頗有野心。在後來幾年中，我們在判斷上十分相左。在晨初幾年中，對於政策上的重要問題，我也覺得我和其他同事意見一致的情形，比和韋爾斯來得多。當然，我應該負一切決定的責任，而在每一情形之下，我總努力以赴。</p>
<p>一九三三年五月，韋爾斯啓程赴古巴，隨身帶着我五月一日頒發的訓令，其中說：「你應該時時牢記美國政府和古巴政府之間的關係，是存在於自主，獨立，平等國家之間的關係，不應該採取任何步驟，致使美國政府似乎更有行使正式干涉的權利之必要，這種權利雖爲兩國間現行條約由規定給予美國的」。我訓令他在能力範圍之內，應以一切援助給予古巴，改善經濟狀况，和古已談判貿易協定，提供友好的調停，並且向馬却杜總統誠舉表示一點，就是我們希望他採取步驟以結束恐佈狀態。</p>
<p>八月十二日，馬却杜將軍請假離職，翌日，前國務卿凱斯貝蒂斯（Dr.　Carlos　de　Caspedes）組成了聯合政府。馬却杜出走後，混亂擴大，到處發生襲擊生命財產的事件。羅斯福總統派了兩艘巡洋艦到古巴領海去，但是聲明，此一行動絲毫不含有千涉或者干預古巴內政的意味。</p>
<p>我們決定毋需給予凱斯貝蒂斯總統正式的承認，因爲政府的更迭，根木是照憲法的稈序達成的。韋爾斯在努力工作，和各黨派保特接觸·八月十二日，國務院以總統和我個人的名義發電給威爾斯，向他表示熱烈的賀意，並且「對你的工作表示讚賞」。</p>
<p>我時常就古巴問題，和重要拉丁美洲國家的大使，進行談話。這是和我所決定的原則相符合的，那就是說，凡是需要我們對拉丁美洲採取外交行動時，不論其性質如何，必須和我們南方的有關國家先行礎商。我們不願意採取單獨的行動。</p>
<p>局勢迅速地向高潮猛進，古巴陸軍山騷動擴大，叛亂日亟。軍隊在巴蒂斯泰部下領導之下發生叛變，凱斯貝蒂斯政府終告崩潰。就在那時候（九月七日），我從韋爾斯大使那裏接到一個很長的電報，建議遺派相當數額的美軍在哈那伐登陸，並且派較少數部隊在古巴其他城市登陸。</p>
<p>他在電報中說：「我所建議的辦法，將屬於極有限的干涉，性質如下：凱斯貝蒂斯政府應准予自由發揮其功能，恰如它未被推翻前一樣，具有充份控制政府每一部門的能力。當然，在大部份軍隊發生叛變的情形之下，它是無法以任何滿意的形式，維特其權力。這一點是很明顯的。如欲使局勢改觀，除非美國政府願意予以協助，以維持公衆秩序，直到古巴政府獲有充份時間……組織一個新陸軍，假如「凱斯貝蒂斯政府」如此要求的話。我們要執行這樣一種政策，勢非以相當數額的軍隊在哈那伐登陸，並以較少數軍隊在該共和國若干比較重耍的港口登陸不可」。</p>
<p>韋爾斯大使還說：「在我看來，這個政策的缺點，完全在這一方面，那就是我們將招致古巴境內過激派和共產國體的非常敵視……但是在我看來，又覺得此間局勢的詳細情形，既已向拉丁美洲各國代表充份說明，遺派軍隊在古巴登陸極明顯的在「善隣」政策範圍之內。這種政策在過去五個月中，已在我們對古巴人民的關係中儘量使其表現出來。」</p>
<p>我在細讀這個電報並加以消化之後，我就親自帶了它到白宮中去見總統，請他一讀。其後，我就堅決向他表示意見，說明我們不能够並且不應該想到干涉古巴的局勢，縱使是有限程度，亦所不取。在我看來，韋爾斯過份受了當地局勢的影嚮，未能顧及在我們徇其要求之後，將在整個拉丁美洲引起的嚴重反嚮。根據我和總統先前的談話，我知道他不干涉古巴局勢的決心，像我一樣堅決。羅斯福先生迅即對我的觀點表示同意。他說他僅將派一艘巡洋艦到古巴領海，那裏我們已經停有幾個小編隊。除非爲了撤退處在古巴政黨衝突夾縫間的美國公民，海軍船隻嚴禁派潰軍隊上岸。</p>
<p>在我和總統會議之後，我就回到旅館中去起草致韋爾斯的覆電，那時已近傍晚。一俟草擬完竣，我再到白宮去。總統和我迅即對電文草稿意見一致。於是我就同到國務院，而在晚上八點鐘的時候發出了我們業已同意的覆電，內容如下：</p>
<p>「我們充份欣賞你在電報巾所列舉的各點。但是，經過深思熟慮之後，總統決定發給你如下的電訊：「我們灤切感到任何諾言，不論是含蓄的或是坦白的，凡是牽涉到在任何情形之下美國將有所行動的，都不可能，這將被認爲破壞巾立，在許多黨派中偏愛一個黨派，以及企圖成立一個政府，而這個政府，在全世界時別是拉丁美洲看來，乃是美國政府的一種產物。」總統和阿根廷，巴西，智利和墨西哥代表的談話，已經獲得美國和整個拉丁美洲的廣泛贊同。任何行動，凡是和規定的政策相反背的，將　成嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>「上面所述，當然不是說你應該去阻止，更不是說你應該去影嚮任何派系的動態；換言之，嚴格的中立係屬必要。」　凱斯貝蒂斯政府垮台之後，馬丁博士（Dr.　Grau　San　Martin）出任總統。我們暫綏承認他的政府，看它能否建立秩序。黨派間的戰爭繼續進行。就在這種情勢之下，我乘輪前往出席蒙吉維多會議，在我啓程兩星期之後，總統發表了一個聲明，表明我國政府願意重行討論一九〇三年的條約，這倏約是給予我們軍事干涉古巴局勢的合法權利的。因此，在蒙吉維多會議揭幕之時，我們的不干涉熊度已爲世界所明瞭。</p>
<p>在整個這一年中，古巴是我國對拉丁美洲新的積極政策的核心。我們對古巴的行動，可以向拉丁美洲其他國家證明我們的不干涉聲明，是否具有誠意。在我返華盛頓途中（從蒙吉維多），古巴的馬丁政府已經消聲匿跡，國民黨領袖孟蒂泰上校（Colonel　Carlos　Mendieta）擔任了總統。我在基衛斯特和卡弗萊大使舉行的談話，就是討論承認孟蒂泰的問題。</p>
<p>在談話完畢之後，我就通電話到華盛頓，向總統說明我支特卡弗萊大使的見解，就是孟蒂泰應予以承認。同一天，我從代理國務卿費里普那裏接接到一個電報，其巾說明總統將邀請在華盛頓的拉丁美洲各國代表，於下星期二或三在白宮和他會晤。總統將告訴他們，就是我們規定的承認古巴政府的先決條件，業已獲致，因爲孟蒂泰已經獲得了民衆的政治支持，並且在古巴武裝部隊的協助之下，政府顯有維持公衆秩序的能力。</p>
<p>現在，國務院就忙於進備一個新條約，以代替一九〇三年的條約。談判於一九三四年五月二十九日開始，我以及助理國務卿韋爾斯和古巴大使史端林簽字於新條約上。韋爾斯懇切地請求我，要我允許他和我一起簽字在上的特權，雖然這種辦法並不是慣常的。但是他既已參與談判的一大部份，所以我也就同意了。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統於同日將條約送呈參議院。在兩天的短時問，參院就票決贊同。批准書係　大月九日交換，古巴民衆爲了這件事宣佈休假三天，以誌慶祝。</p>

<h3>舞業反對禁舞大暴動　搗毀社局毆傷官警　四百餘舞女職工被拘押今日偵訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市廿八家舞廳舞女職工二千餘人，昨日因反對抽籖禁絕舞塲，全體術進社會局，將各處辦公室大部搗毀，門窗桌椅，幾被損壞無遣，更有大批重要文件檔案，盡遭翻出，飛散滿地。當時適值勞資評斷會在二樓開會，潘議長亦在座，幾遭圍困。斯時因在塲警員人數過少，無法制止，多人反遭毆傷，經四十二分鐘之紛擾後，始由大批警員趕到彈壓遏止，其破壞情形之烈，如同刧後戰塲。在紛擾前後，官警受傷多至四十三人，霞飛路嵩山路一帶交通因此亦斷絕六七小時之久。　社同昨日禁舞抽籖，原定下午三時舉行，因適與勞資評斷會開會時間衝突，特提前於上午十一時舉行。乃全體舞女職工下午在新仙林開會時，聞得此項消息，遂羣情激昂，在感情極度衝動之狀態下，直奔社會同，而演出此一幕不幸事件。事後經大批警員趕到包圍搜捕，扣押肈事舞女及職工四百餘人，一時情形混亂，舞女中頗多被擠軋踐路受傷者。迨全部搜查完畢，業已深夜十一時。昨晚全市舞廳，因此俱未營業，亦為上海自有跳舞廳以來所少見之事。</p>
<p>吳市長據報後，極爲震怒，常即會同宣司令電呈中樞報告經過，陳明決將爲有之肈事份子依法嚴辦。警局俞局長亦作同樣表示；宜司令更爲澈底查究搗毀社會局事件之責任者，已下令逮捕舞廳業公會之常務理事。至已被拘押之四百餘人將於今日開始偵訊。</p>
<h3>新仙林大會　傳來惡耗　情緒緊張</h3>
<p>下午二時，全市二十八家舞廳經理職工舞女等共數千人，在新仙林召開第三次臨時大會。新仙林園內人潮汹湧，旗幟高張，牆上貼有各種反對禁舞標語。大會開始之時，適消息傳來，社會局業已提早於上午抽籖，淘汰舞廳十四家，第一流如仙樂，百樂門，米高美，麗都等悉在其內。是時會塲情緒立見緊張，舞女職工轉輾相告，神情甚爲激動。舞業公會理事長孫洪元乃就麥克風前首先將此事報告，認爲社會局未來通知而提早抽籖爲不合理，並謂憲法規定人民有自由選擇職業之權，政府所稱舞塲妨碍節約有傷風化等均不成其爲理由，故舞業同人決據理力爭，要求政府收回成命。在孫洪元講畢之時，職工羣衆中有入高喊「反對抽籖」！於是全塲響應，一片「反對抽籤」之聲，歷時約一分鐘始畢。</p>
<p>高呼情願流血</p>
<p>繼起發言者有舞女代表孫致敏，職工會常務理事胡運源，職工代表王連生，舞女陳雪莉，金美虹等數人，言辭均甚激烈，羣衆情緒乃益見高張，塲內呼喊聲此起彼落。孫致敏稱：今日爲生死關頭，社會局提早抽籤太覺過份，大家要團結起來向社會局評理，要抽讓我們看了抽，否則有舞弊。爲什麼營業性舞廳要禁而派對舞不禁？我們團結起來一致反對，同生共死。職工會理事胡運源能態度尤爲激烈，言辭中並攻擊吳開先局長。其時職工羣衆中有人高喊「反對吳開先！反對吳局長！」及「到社會局去，情願流血」等呼聲，經　儀在麥克風中連喊「鎭靜！鎭靜」後始暫時停息。此後舞女陳雪莉自動上台演說，聲淚俱下，她說：「我一家大小八人，此後如何生活！這是政府在逼我們出賣靈魂，逼我們去做妓女。」金美虹亦稱：「政府逼我們走上死亡之路，我們不願意做妓女。」舞女羣中乃又起呼喊之聲。</p>
<p>在會塲一片衝動情緒中，米高美理事長鄭煒顯比較鎭定，鄭在麥克風中告羣眾稱：此事已託律師向南京方面提出行政訴願，依法力爭，希望大家理智一點。但　衆情緒顯然並未因此曲抵落。</p>
<p>化整為零直奔社局</p>
<p>此後市商會代表吳紀春起立致詞，表示同情之意，並謂今晨抽籖，市商會並未派人參加。婦女團體陸惠民張紅薇兩人亦均在塲，但並未發言。此時巳近下午三時，羣衆至此已感不耐，人叢中衝起一到社會局去」及「時間經濟」之呼聲，嚮澈全塲。正在將喊口號後散會之時，總工會理事長水祥雲趕到，水氏首先表示同情之意，繼稱：渠於上午已與吳局長談過，吳局長乃奉中央命令不得不做，自有其苦衷。關於婦女及職工生活問題，社會局已決定開辦舞女轉業訓練班，職工發給遣散費，其經費將在舞塲茶資中附加救濟金籌募。最後勸告羣眾切勿感情用事，而應保特理智，在守法範圍內據理力爭，工會方面一定支持。不料當水氏詞畢，職工中竟有人高喊「請水祥雲先生領導到社會局去請願」，水氏後雖脫身，舞女及職工羣一衆則紛紛擁出新仙林大門，化整爲零，或徒步或乘卡車，陸續赴社會局廣塲中集合。</p>
<h3>開始動武　飛行堡壘難堵人潮　十四警員首先挨打</h3>
<p>首批於三時三十分抵達，之後陸續隨來，至四時左右，二十八家舞女職工及樂師等相繼到達，共集有二千餘人，排隊面北而立。舞廳業同業公會理事長孫洪元，總幹事朱永明等亦均到塲。社會局廣塲但見旗幟招展，人頭攒動。</p>
<p>時二樓局長會議室正在召開勞資評斷委員會第十六次會議，商討職業工人件工年終獎金問題等要案，市參議會議長潘公展，市商會理事長徐寄廣，衛生局長張維，工業協會常務理事胡伯翔，總工會秘書長梁永章等，均親往參加。由兼主仟委員吳開先出席全特。社會局第四處長袁文彰及第十科長陳肅則於辦公室中等候舞女職工推派代表前來申述。是時緊集廣塲之羣衆人聲嘈雜。至四時零五分，人羣中首先有「我們要吃飯」之呼聲發出，此起彼應，逐漸擴大，繼之人羣向前移動，逐漸近及台階。在塲維持秩序之警局飛行堡壘十四名警員竭力加以勸阻，然人羣蜂湧向前一部份舞女職工將手持之旗幟竹竿上下左右猛擊警員面額少數警員無法阻遏似潮水湧來之人羣，乃被一轟而上，踏上台階，分自左右二扶梯直上二樓，分別衝入副局長室，會議室及三樓之勞資評斷委員會辦公室，將室內所有玻璃門窗，電燈，電話，文件，桌椅雜物盡加搗毀。並將破碎之椅足，木板，文件等物自窗口擲向廣塲。將電話織文件亂擲於地，對諸人之勸導，一　置諸不理會。　燕叱驚嗔凶悍無比</p>
<p>斯時舞女羣一改平日溫婉近人情態，擅拳捋袖，叱咤吆喝，悍狀　露，頓時紙屑玻片紛飛，局長室瞬間即被破壞無遺。即沙發面亦被撕破，物無巨細，無一完整，僅分置東西兩　之蔣主席油畫像及半身銅像，仍屹立無動。局長宅內之壁鐘亦被敲毀，時針正指四時三十四分。</p>
<p>潘議長等險遭殃及</p>
<p>是時潘議員在社會局秘書室，擬將當時情形以電話告知宣司令，一舞女見後，衝向前去，以手撳住電話機加以阻止，另一舞女則一面哭鬧一面取桌上硯池，敲破檯玻璃，並以茶杯猛擲檯燈，站立在傍之潘議長險遭殃及。徐副議長則因水盂破碎，面部被水濺及。</p>
<p>同時廣堪上亦陷於一片混亂，一部份職工自另一台階衝入社會局第一處各辦公室，以竹竿擊破各窗玻璃及電燈，並搗毀各物。辦公椅桌被紛紛擲於廣塲中，再由其他各人一一拆毀。第一處第四科爲糧食科，常羣眾衝入時，科長吉明齋曾高呼「此地是辦理你們吃飯糧食的地方」，羣衆答以「大家沒有飯吃，不管，打，二二號牛澤自人　中擠出，往第三處處長室打電話報告總局。被羣衆趕往追打，後經地政局一　員救出鎖於汽車間中，方告倖免。機動車大隊第三中隊分隊長盧　浪及隊員數人，在紛亂中亦被以竹竿及木塊擲傷。經救護專趕送醫院治療。廣塲上滿地皆爲破桌，殘椅，撕毀之紙張，文件及竹竿標語，碎玻璃等物。停放塲中之一部份汽車，亦遭殃及，　窗玻璃皆被以竹竿大棍戮破。</p>
<h3>廣塲展開混戰　雙方傷者各達數十人</h3>
<p>警分局長受創　被奪手槍三支</p>
<p>當羣衆開始進行搗毀時，嵩山警分局已得訊，派來警員二十餘人，協助維特秩序，詎羣衆又變更對象，紛持木棍　湧向彼等衝去，警員徒手招架，結果不支退出，時嵩山分局第二批應援警員開到，乃又合併重復入內，終以秩序混亂，警員等被迫三進三出，仍無法實施彈壓。斯時嵩山警分局長宋廷均偕股長戎詠韶，適亦自林森路正門進內察看，與一部份羣衆遭遇，在捉棒飛舞下，二人頭部及面頃擊傷甚重。飛行堡壘隊員因見事熊已無法收拾，遂用無綫電報告總局，俞局長急抽調全部刑警及剩餘飛行堡壘隊員，開赴社局，以鋼盾作掩護，紛紛衝進，廣場中遂發生一塲混戰，紙片木塊，滿天飛舞，在相持不下間，警員有三四十人受傷踣地，舞女及職工亦有數十人被擠倒踐踏受傷，均經車送醫院急治。舞業羣衆因人數佔優，搏鬥益亟，警員中有三人佩槍竟被奪去，惟迄晚上，此三支失槍均已查獲。時有被派在北站之保安警察已奉命前來增援，於四時四十分趕到，全體工兩批，逐一檢查身份證，舞女執照，舞業公會會員證，及手上有無泥汚血漬，以判斷其曾否參加搗亂。當塲發現涉嫌有據或身份不明者，均加以扣押，扣押後更由社局在塲目觀之職員逐一指認，檢查直至十一時始畢，計扣　男女四百餘名，分送各警分局羈押，定今晨起開始嚴密偵訊。</p>
<p>舞女痛哭連稱被迫</p>
<p>在檢查進行中，頗多舞女痛哭失聲，連稱彼等實係被迫而來，事前因團體通告爲不參加須罰三百萬元。其餘各舞廳賬房，車夫，小郎，甚至擦皮鞋者亦在檢查時發現，聞亦多係被逼參加。最後在行列中查獲維也納舞廳稽查金保龍，及專修舞廳沙發商人王振達身畔蔽有手槍，因挾帶武器參加搗亂，亦併予逮捕。</p>
<p>舞女聯誼會代表孫致敏，孟燕二人，昨晚亦遭傳訊，渠等否認參與此次搗亂，警局以事實尙待調查，亦命暫押候訊。</p>
<p>各首長商討對策　孫洪元交出兩會負責人名單　宣司令強調必須嚴辦</p>
<p>在衝突終止後，宣司令到塲，即約潘議長，徐副議長，吳局長，祝局長同在地政局會議室內談話，熟商對策。陳保泰朱虛白亦在座。六時十分，警局人員將舞業公會理事長孫洪元帶到。吳局局長質問：開大會爲何不報局核准？孫答稱：一切由該會主席團決定，資方認為舞廳開不開均無關係。宣司令當時　指出：警局接得備案之公函時，事實上大會已開，所以是先開會後備案。關於到社局請願一節，孫洪元謂出於勞方之要求。吳開先局長問在大會中何人提議請願，孫不能答。宣司令謂舞業在此事中欺騙警局，他們報告警局說：大會開過後，預備回家，不再游行請願，而結果是到了社會局。吳局長慨然道：我處處想到舞業之困難，中央有人親我是「姑自養奸」，禁舞決議在去年九月，但延至現在實行，無非使舞廳能有一個淘金的機會，而舞業之報我者爲打毀社會局！最近市政會議中，我尙主張舞廳抽籤禁絕一半，但舞女並不停業一半，以維獲其生計。會議至六時半，即決定責成孫洪元交出舞業理事會及舞應職工會之全部負責人晨名單，以便偵訊。宣司令並强在此事必須嚴辦，「否則地方當局將永不執前往查看，全氏於下午五時抵社會局，至內部察看一週，並搜集各項物證，至七時離社會局，將經過情形據情　告黃首席，以爲將來偵查該案之參考。</p>
<h3>北站緊張一幕　學生集團歸滬度歲　驚動大批軍警戒備</h3>
<p>〔本報訊同濟學潮發生後，當局對學生動態，甚爲注意。昨日忽據報，南京金陵大學學生數百人，乘第五次車來滬慰勞同濟學生等語。當局即預派大批軍警到站妥爲保護。警察局局長俞叔平·路局警務處王兆槐處長·市政府總務處歐陽遵銓處長·敎育部訓導會副主委局或文·警局警備科科長陸大公等，咸及時趕到北站，並由路局預備大客車三輛，供金大學生乘坐。四時正列車進站，站上空氣頓時緊張。車上學生引頸見狀，莫不驚異。路警處當即派員上前找尋學生代表，據學生方面稱：彼輩為金大男女兩校滬籍學生三百八十餘人，係集體還鄉度寒假，並有訓導長魏眾超率領云云。魏氏亦當即向俞局長·周副主委保證確係學生還家，決無其他行動。全體學生乃由路局招待搭乘大客軍分別送回家中。學生得此意外優待，欣喜異常，站上軍警亦即撒回行中央的政令，學生可毆辱地方行政長官，舞女可搗毀政府機關，此非行憲，而爲暴動。這兩三天，國際間對我國的印象壞極了」。此時廣塲上已開始搜查工作，會議遂告中止。與會人員除吳局長外，紛紛離開社局，當時警備森嚴，潘議長離塲時，亦先說明身份，再由警士以無綫電傳話器請示後始放行。</p>
<p>檢察官蒞勘</p>
<p>舞女搗毀社會局後，吳局長即電話告知地檢處首席檢察官黃亮，黃首席即紙全　檢察官</p>
<p>吳局長談話　，事後吳局長向記者表示：「此次辦理禁舞之事，事前極爲審慎，其分期禁絕辦法，並經市政會議通過，且由市府呈經行政院備案，各方以此等辦法堪稱雙方兼顧，均表示相當滿意，昨日該批暴徒等未經由正當之請求方式陳訴理由，而出以聚衆暴動，公然搗毀行政機關，且胆敢毆辱警衛，目無法紀，顯係匪黨有組織之行動，除一面積極整理，照常辦公外，將　市府及警備部從嚴究辦，以維秩序，而張法紀。禁舞決照呈准辦法，嚴格執行，決不猶豫。」社局第四處處長袁文彰，亦就主管地位表示下列意見：「　此事之本質爲一治安間題，故已由警局負責辦理。　舞業公會理事長及舞廳職工會理事長均由社局之廚房內搜出，均由警局加以扣押，至於是否有主使嫌疑，正在偵訊中。　社會局昨日所受之損失，並未要求舞業賠償。　今日舞廳是否營業一節，已向市長請示中。　禁舞仍分請期禁絕，外傳將改成一次禁絕說無根據，社局方面亦並無此種主張。」</p>
<p>張院長指示　又中樞對此事件經過，亦已接獲報告，因吳市長，宣司令已於五時四十分會銜，電京報告行政院張院長，張院長得報大爲震怒，並即在電話中指示，對為首者必予最嚴厲之處置。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕今天雖爲禮拜日，但社會局決定加班辦公，整理案卷，明日起預料一切可恢復常態。昨日該局遭搗毀時，三樓之檔案保管室因員工聞警後，先以食米堵門，故該局之檔案，除各處科已提出者外，其餘之重要檔案幸免損失。惟第一科之工商登記卡片及第四科之糧商登記卡，均　刧奪散擲，如無副本，則整理頗費時間。該局之檔案　昨日亦未遭刧，因羣衆衝進時，員工已將庫內之電炬熄減，羣衆倉皇未加辨識，遂得倖免。此外社局第四處之辦公室，因少數職員之機智，臨時以白粉筆在門壁上寫「地政局」三字，亦獲保全。該局被搗毀者，計爲局長室，副局長室，局長會議室，秘書室，會議室，事務科，繕校室，勞資評斷會，第一處處長室，物價管理科，糧食科及工商登記科。第一處農林漁收合作科及統計室因僻處邊隅，未被注意而得免。全部損失無從估計。</p>
<p>吳局長脫險</p>
<p>時局長會議室之門已下銷，勞資評斷會亦暫告停開，羣衆蜂湧擊破甬道之玻璃門，二舞女更用力以木棍擊破局長會議室之本門，站立門前之潘議長侍衛陳子雲，雖聲明係參議會職員，後腦仍被一舞女以破椅足猛擊一下。門破後，羣衆入局長會議室，時吳局長巳由局員引導自小門退避入地政局，潘議長。徐副議長及社會局趙顧問等，則在塲勸導舞女職工勿如此妄動，如有申訴，可推代表面述。但參加搗毀者行動囂張，一部份舞女大哭大鬧，口中高呼「我們要飯吃，你們不給我們飯吃」，一手則持破椅足或木棍，見有玻璃電燈等物，則加堅破，並打」。室內各物亦被搗毀無遺。紛亂巾飛行堡壘第一一組警員〇四揷上刺刀衝進，羣衆稍退，嗣第二三批保警又聞訊趕到，警局警備科長陸大公下令將刺刀退下，互相携手，迫羣衆退往廣塲兩角，舞女在南，職工在北，外面團團圍住，羣衆見情勢不敵，始紛紛拋却木棍，空氣頓見緩和，一塲衝突至此方告結束，先後歷時計四十二分鐘。</p>
<h3>分批檢查扣押疑犯</h3>
<p>六時後，警員將在塲羣衆分爲舞女與職長當即加以訓斥，謂社會局儘可能爲舞業解除困難，而今日舞女反來打社會局，公會理事長應負責任。潘議長態度亦頗激動，謂參議會過去同情舞業之困難，今日舞廳如有正常理由，儘可採取正當途徑由參議會轉達地方當局，今日之行動，完全是暴徒，須知共產黨對上海有一套整個的計劃，而舞業則已爲其利用。孫洪元此時亦知事熊嚴重，運運搖頭，但態度尙鎭定，不斷答辯。吳</p>

<h3>新疆問題　卅年間影事　與今後展望</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　馬次伯</p>
<p>〔本報迪化一月廿四日航訊〕新疆政治的演變，遠的我們不談，僅就民國成立至伊寗事變的三十餘年間，新疆始終沒有揚開她的面罩，儼然保有她亞洲處女地的神秘性，除了幾位國際上有名的考古家，曾作一番探險式的發掘外，中國人對這塊自己的地方，對數百萬自己的同胞，永久是弄不淸楚。楊增新十七年的無爲而治，政尙儉明，可算是太平勝世，老百姓至今猶念念不忘，但他對中央是認廟不認神服管不服調，名份雖然是中國的行省，實際的行政權却是另有格調，獨往獨來。金樹仁大體上是繼承楊增新的餘緒，但他的才調不如楊增新，雖然對由央若即若離的情形如故，而內政的腐敗，引起了民族的料紛與社會的紛擾，遂爲新疆開了亂源，人民大大的蒙受　炭，這是時勢　英雄罷，在金樹仁政權的弱點下，產生了兩位因緣時會的冒險家—盛世才與馬仲英，新疆最後的局面，變成了盛馬逐鹿的疆塲，他們爭霸的拉鋸戰，對壘了半年天氣，曾經有過精彩的表演。馬仲英雖然英　尙戰，一度造成了圍攻油化的傑作，但他畢竟不如留學日本走過西伯利亞大鐵路的盛世才有國際眼光，被盛世才利用外援把他擊潰，當他退到喀什，尙保有南疆半壁河山，大有與盛世才平分秋色的趨勢，終久因爲他不懂「政治」這一套玩意兒，受人的圈套而自投羅網，廿三年某月，馬仲英以一種中國緣林豪客的俠義精神，走入莫斯科以後，直到現在沒有消息，他撇下一羣患難的夥伴，天天盼他歸來，想像出許多事宣傳說，但他已經永久成爲神話的人物了。</p>
<p>盛世才當政時　神秘恐怖莫測</p>
<p>新疆自盛世才當政以後，看破時代的弱點，乾脆來個認賊作父，使新疆不但神秘而且恐怖，大刀闊斧的推行他的大大政策，在他的法典中再找不到祖國的字樣，他就是新疆人民的首領。猩猩峽的國際工事，槍口一律向東，哈密駐了外國的軍隊，漢人休問陽關以西是誰家的天下。大家對新疆問題更是莫測高深，只好望洋興歎。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，事情有往往出人意想者，當太平洋的烽火正高漲無已，列寗格勒的爭奪戰正激列進行的時候，盛世才突然來一個一百八十展的轉變，把整個新疆的領土，原原本本的交還國家，可以說盛世才統制新疆十年，是無惡不作，但他一善足以解百惡，總算沒有使國土變色，他做了疆疆霸王，又能撑開范　舟，不能說不識時務，自盛氏慨然的自新疆撤退，飛往重慶就任農林部長而離開了他的寶座以後，新疆神秘的面紗，就算揭開了，全國人民對新疆可以透一透新鮮空氣。但是新疆與內地的政情民俗，整整的隔絕了三十餘年，國人對新疆的一般常識，實在太議陋了，當日我們關於新疆的重歸祖國，等於脫　換籍，算是第二次世界大戰中的一個重要揷曲的這點意義，倉卒之問未能加以認識，所以伊寗事變發生，最初大家都估價過低，更加上敵人的官傳，披上了政治的民族的外衣，眞是五光十色，眩耀耳目。其實事件的內容，非常簡單，可以說沒有盛世才的轉變，就沒伊寗事件的發生，伊寗事件是新疆重歸祖國後，一個必然不可避免的反應。所以我們不必窮究事鑾的起因，而對於領導事變的幾個巾心人物的歷史關係，政治因緣，國籍問題，也不必作詳細的硏討，而要認定伊恍悟事件是盛世才留下的一筆「國際負債」，所以和平一年以來，眼見目覩的新疆政局演變的情形，不外是這筆「國際負債」的討價還價罷了。伊寗事鑾的責任，不能完全給當日的爲政當局頂多只能說他們見事不明，防範不週，至於事鑾的必然發生，係有國際陰謀的導演，所以今天我們要瞭解新疆問題的癥結，只須就和平談判以後，一種特殊的政治企圖在新疆的消長加以分析，就可以明瞭其大概了。解決，他們要求親蘇，民主團，結的尺度，將有無限度的發展與變質。張治中將軍爲求得新疆的眞正和平，以大無畏的精神，慷慨堅毅的作風，担起了一個千斤重担，對伊寗方面所提出的一切苛刻的條件，一股腦都答應了。而張將軍對他們只提出一個要求，就是要伊寗的人民擁護國家，不論親蘇民主和平團結，都須在統一的國家行政範圍內來實施，說到親蘇，中國與蘇聯根本有一個友好協定，全國都能實用，新疆當然不能列外，不能另有親蘇的條文，民主是時代潮流所趨，新疆常然應該迎頭趕上，新疆是民族最複雜的地方，不團結不足以談和平，新疆與蘇聯壤地相接數千里，不親蘇也不能談和平，新疆是中華民國的領土，假若要脫離國家成為劃據的局面，當然更不能談和平了，不和平就不能建設，不建設就不能進步，這是一個天經地義的道理，張將軍就用這個道理去說服他們，但伊寗方面對於「國家」總感覺對厭，認爲這是漢人的東西，與他們無關，所以和平商談遭受的重重困難，大半是集　於「統一」兩個字的身上。</p>
<p>和平簽字以後，張將軍　對人說：「現在他們，什麼都要只是不要國家，他要什麼，我就給什麼總有一天他會什麼都不要而只要國家了，認識國家才是他們最後的歸宿」。的確，沒有這種磅薄的氣魄，就不配來解決新疆問題。</p>
<p>當第一次舉行慶說和平商談成功的酒會時，張將軍首先舉酒致謝居間調停的蘇總領事薩維烈夫先生，他說：「新疆的和平，要是沒有薩總領事從中和解，是不會實現的」。他滿面的笑容裹包含無限的辛酸，打了門牙合血吞，飲了那杯謝情的酒，國家興亡的事只有自己心裏明白。（明日續完）</p>

<h3>打開和平之門　集中於三焦點</h3>
<p>有國際背景，有政治野心而妄自尊大的伊寗小朝庭，他企圖的陰險，條伴的苛刻，使和平商談在進行中所遭父的困難與波折，實在不是局外人所能想像的，當日中央的代表張治中將軍，以最純潔的誠意，最大的耐心，和伊寗暴動人民的四個代表，先後作了數十度的商談曾經有過幾度的破裂，幾度的恢復，其中最嚴重的一次，約有一月多沒有進行商談，大家都當心着沉悶的空氣不易打開，舉兌還是張將軍有超人的政治修養，他始終沒有改變態度，仍以他的耐心與誠意去感化對方，卒使和平條款於卅五年六月六日舉行簽字。　在商談的進行中可以說是無話不談，一切虛僞的似面具都給揭穿了。問題不外集中於三個焦點，就是外交，民族，政治。張治由將軍對於解決這個問題，早已胸有成竹，在進入新疆不久的五月七日，就發表了建設三民主義新新疆的文告，提出了民主，和平，團結，統一的四大口號。問題的解決總算沒有超出張將軍擬定的範圍，從和平條款到施政綱領，整個的內容，不外乎外交主張親蘇，政治實行民主，民族厲行團結，國家必須統一，大家共同的目標是求得新疆的和平安定建設，這是多麼堂皇面又正大的政治口號，假若在陰暗的一面，沒有特殊的企圖，張治中將軍的治新政策眞算合理合法的一種政治改革了。但事實絕不如此節單，伊寗方面認爲和平條款的簽字，是間題的開始，不是間題的</p>
<h3>同濟解散與否關鍵繫於明日復課情形　主管當局刻正密切注視中</h3>

<p>俞警局長自請處分</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕同濟大學敎授反校友五十餘人，昨下午假中美醫院舉行談話會，對各界譴責該校當局，未能盡善責任問題，有所解釋與討論。杭次長於下午七時假公訓同學會邀宴丁校長及各院系負責人，席間杭氏及丁校長均表示澈底解決同濟學潮之決心，各敎授威望敎育部對同濟應加撥經費，擴充設備，增聘敎授，加强學術硏究，俾使學生專心學問，不預外務。</p>
<h3>市長精神轉佳　後天籌募獎學金會　仍將扶病出席主持</h3>

<h3>市府新聞處發表　市長被毆經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據市府新聞處昨發表：吳市長於上月廿九日在同濟大學調解學潮時，被毆受傷時之眞相如下：</p>
<p>衆人擁圍市長時，即有人高喊，不能打市長，然此時已有人扼住市長喉嚨，一人抱住市長腰際，一人掀去市長帽子，打掉眠鏡，並準向市長頭上左右額打兩棍，拖倒地上。此時即有人喊警察打人，市長即說：「讓我起來發令，不准警察開槍打人。」語未竟，即又問人喊：「不准他起來，」此聲與警察打人之聲，完全相同，實出自一人口中。證以同濟大學法學院學生馮立文（該校學生自治會副常務理事）於被拘獲親筆供詞：「常我回來向同學讀黃伯權先生寫的名牌時，大隊與警士衝突，人即往兩邊分散，我高呌不能打市長。自已也同時倒地，在地上倒睡去起時，聽有「不讓他起來」一話，自己畏石頭與馬隊　傷害，起分後，立即往左邊　開。是何人呌不讓起來與打市長的是誰，我未看見，市長在人叢中，呌警士不要開槍一語，我是聽到的」。再證以同濟大學工學院學生黃　魯（該校晋京請願廳主席團之一）於被拘後供稱：一當發生毆打時，因爲秩序紊亂，市長被毆，確是事實。但是各校所到的同學過多，也記不清是誰毆打的。不過我們主席團常時疏忽了保護責任，這樣不過是我個人說的話，其他負責主席團的人，是否　認這個責任，這不得而知了」</p>
<p>此外尙有同濟大學工學院學生蔡明德在供詞中亦喊認：「看見吳市長被打了兩棍」之語。又該校工學院學生薛瑜琨在供詞中稱：「我很歡喜市長來替我們解決事情，根本沒有理由去打市長，當然是匪徒所為，可以調查的」。足證吳市長當被毆受匪完全係事實。</p>

<p>反封破壞擁護建設</p>
<p>復旦大學校長章益向畢業學生演講，勗勉三點：　以建設代替破壞：生命之意義是多少要在世界上留下一點對人類社會的貢戲或建設，使後人看後得到鼓勵，故一切破壞行動，皆須反對，擁護建設！　以服務代替自私：助人爲快樂之本，天下沒有較自私更痛苦的人，人生最快樂的生活是完全忘我，而將全部中精神寄託在工作努力和奮鬥巾。　以合作代替鬥爭：人心有愛恨兩種，合作是愛的表現，鬥爭是恨的表現，人之相處很易發生磨擦，目前最大困難爲「分裂」，「仇恨」，與「鬥爭」，如欲爭取領袖地位，祗有爲人服務與合作，才能得他人信仰。今日之國家與個人，有三害要除，吾人應效法古時之周處，以建設剷除失敗主義，以服務去除自私，以合作去除分裂，人人求其革新，則國家必能興盛。</p>
<p>立身技能不在升學</p>
<p>敎局李代局長亦致詞申述三點：　中學畢業後，不一定要進大學，同學切勿因不能進大學而致天望，志氣消沉。須知立身技能不一定於大學中獲得，在公司工廠或商店中亦可獲得袖充敎育。　靑年愛國情緒不應加以責備，但愛國方法應爲建設的，而非破壞的。　當今一部份政治設施不良，係屬事實，但應以合法手段，就憲法範圍，促使求其逐潮改進，不能以流血破壞之手段出之，而致使整個國家社會於不安。李代局長祝望各同學離校後，皆能在學業或事業上有所成就。詞畢，給憑給獎，由各校代表依次領受。最後由畢業生代表致答詞，禮成後，體專學生表演體育。</p>

<h3>六區棉紡公會派遣代表　與紗管會交換意見　主管處長對所陳各節表示同情</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區公會昨日遵袁主委之，派代表五人，到紗管會说舆主管處長交换意见，代表等陳述甚詳，各處長頗爲同情。並定於下星期一　　商談云。</p>
<p>又訊：六區棉紡公會對袁主委談話，發表意見：</p>
<p>本會會員對政府代紡代織統購統銷政策，素極擁護。此次推派代表，向袁主委陳述意見，當蒙表示，可予考慮，並資成主管處，會同研討。乃昨日袁主委之談話，誤認本會所提供之善憲建議，爲意圖要挾，違抗政府，措辭嚴厲，引起各會員紛紛到會質問。際此憲政開始，袁主委此種表示，深爲遺憾。我國紡織業，在日本抬頭之威脅下，危機嚴重，有目共覩。袁主委以主管地位，反認爲本會起草宣言，說明危機爲「庸人自擾」，未免誤解。關於本會意見六點，究竟有無要挾用意，今特披露報端，以明眞相。至駐廠專員一節，因代舫旣山各廠專負責任，自有規定可資依據，事實上無設置必要，亦屬實情。當前原棉恐慌早爲各方所公認，本會會員因事業生存，攸關國計民生，社會安定，不無祀憂，　請注意，毫無危詞聳聽之義。今袁主委旣表示絕無問題，各廠聞之，均極欣慰。但願原棉供應不竭，各廠自不致有被迫停工情事，致勞袁主委之「執法以繩」也。</p>
<p>總之，本會會員擁護國策，未敢後人，今日問題，爲如何上下一心，官民合作，以共挽此民族工業之深重危機，至私人利害，固早置之度外，所望當局，推愛護斯業之心，行合理措施之實，本會會員自無有不竭誠擁戴者也。</p>
<p>公會提供意見要點</p>
<p>茲錄六區公會呈花紗布管理委員會，提供採納各點如下：</p>
<p>（一）代紡棉紗，應請鈞會先行撥發原棉，分期紡交棉紗。</p>
<p>政府旣委託各廠代紡棉紗，自應先將原棉撥付，俾便代紡分期交紗。况各廠原棉存底薄弱，瞬將吿罄，如鈞會不先撥發原棉，萬一因緩不濟急，而致停工，勢必發生嚴重之後果。</p>
<p>（二）代紡棉紗，每件用棉及工繳，應請完全依照行總所定原案，按同等同質之美棉計算爲標準，並以原定案之九月份爲基期，比照各種指數，分月計算。</p>
<p>査行總以七百十二磅半棉花，換紡廿支棉紗一件案，係九月份所定，其所供棉花，全爲美棉，將來代紡之原棉，如係同樣美棉，自當以同量棉花計算。如棉質有變更時，應請按實際品質，分別升算或折算。又構成工繳之各項費用價値不一，變率不同，苟以棉價一種爲計算根據，必與工繳實際不符，故其計算方法，應分析其構成因子，（根據前紡調會，上年九月份二十支棉紗之各項費用百分率計算），以原案之九月份爲基期，按各種指數分月計算。</p>
<p>（三）代紡工繳，應按照上月份工繳指數，分每月一日及十六日，兩次撥付，以資週轉，其當月指數尾找，須於下月五日前找補淸訖。</p>
<p>各廠平時營運資金及一切開繳，俱賴抛售期紗，先獲價款，以貨應付。如管理辦法實施以後，各廠不能售紗，勢將難以週轉，不得不仰賴預支工繳爲挹注。</p>
<p>（四）代紡之花紗，應以在廠內收交爲原則，俾資劃一成本，血免偏枯。各代紡廠散處各地，如收花交紗地點規定集中一處，則距離遠近不一，運輸費川將影響成本之高低，不如就廠收廠交爲原則，以資劃一。</p>
<p>（五）設備陳舊之紗廠，紡紗成本較大，應請請鈞會酌予補助。</p>
<p>創設較久之紗廠，其設備大都陳舊，平時紡紗出數不克臻於標凖，應請鈞會酌予補助。</p>
<p>（六）各廠因電力限制，時有停工，其自行發電者，亦因動力費用激增，影響成本，應請鈞會設法補助。</p>
<p>各廠以電力短少，被迫停工，以致不能盡量生產，影響工繳匪淺，而自行發電之紗廠，燃煤採購艱難，動力成本超出預算，應請鈞會設法，予以補救。</p>
<p>紗布回疲花價轉挺</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以管制政策，嚴格執行，人心極度虚軟。銀根雖趨鬆弛，因總結東期日近，客銷不動，本　同業及複製廠商均鮮採納，一般浮多了吐，賣氣濃郁，喊價迂迴下游。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗較之上日冋跌一百萬，爲五千七百八十萬元。其餘十支十六支及卅二·四十支等粗細紗，一致軋小一二十萬至八九十萬元不一。</p>
<p>棉布　晨開因散戶爭進，行情再見高翔。龍頭細布一百六十三萬元成交頗多，五福細布最高達一百卅二萬二千元，後因紡建公司開布，大量供售，實力派布商及染廠相繼競資，喊價逐步下挫。迨至最後，十二磅各檔細布比上日回跌一·二萬至五千元，此外嗶嘰直貢價亦下瀉二萬元，其餘各布脚地似亦平疲。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕紡建公司循例供售棉布三十四種，三A彩球細布售一百廿五萬五千元，5225玩傘細布一百八十五萬元，四君子元嗶嘰一百五十一萬五千元，金蓮妙舞一百五十萬元，四君子直貢呢一百六十四萬五千元，配價與市價無甚上下。共售布一三三六〇疋，被單二〇條，永龍單三千碼，申購單共二八九張，內除廠商一〇張，購布一九二〇疋外，餘悉屬各布號所購。</p>
<p>棉花</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况由平轉挺，紡建開價收購，去銷熱化，同業競售，價格較上日升高五萬一担，成交三六三包。送廠價做開漢口細絨五四九萬七千，五三七萬三千，脫力司五九五萬二千，山東木架五八七萬。又棧交價做開漢細五三三萬二千，周浦籽花一二四萬五千。</p>
<p>中信局議定</p>
<p>人造絲牌價</p>

<p>呢羢夏貨反俏</p>
<p>呢羢市面，因實銷落令，拆息高昂，又兼常今高物價下，購買力薄弱，是以零　交易莫不咸轉寂寞。所有標準，因此亦俱多趨於平疲。昨除夏令貨較形挺秀外，餘皆形成明平暗降之事實。大衣呢平厚呢麥而登等，縮跌尤甚</p>

<h3>噴水壺與貓</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>東門失火，鄰人紛紛肩挑負担，忙着把一桶一桶的水向前灌救。當衆人都是焦頭爛額，筋疲力盡，而火勢尙朱到可以控制的時期，有一個人獨特見解，認爲這樣的救火，恐有波及鄰近已經燻焦，尙未燃燒的木屋。所以爲了防止火勢蔓延起見，應當徴集叫澆花用的噴水壺五千只，在火塲四周「澆花」，以便遏止火舌的伸展，火勢的蔓延！</p>
<p>我剛寫完上面的驚歎號，一位朋友適巧走進來，看到這段文字，連說這種事情揑造得太露痕跡，一無事實作爲根據。我心中不免暗笑，這原是編造出來的，不過有一個範本，按了格式臨慕下來。這範本便是最近合衆社電傳：美國貓社準備在三十九州，以及加拿大·哥斯達黎加等地求貓五萬頭，運往歐洲，殲滅鼠患—捕捉與歐洲飢民爭食之老鼠。</p>
<p>我記起前次本談中刊載的一段短文：貓的歸宿。當電影製片商臨時向獸苑徽用來充配角的幾白頭貓已經感到不需要時，籌措人以「會上銀幕」爲號召，把每頭貓定價一元五角美金，全數出售掉了。不然的話，倒是貓社主席康且爾力理想中的徵求品。</p>
<p>不過使我們懷疑的是這五萬頭貓，到了歐洲，萬一其中有百分之幾十濫竽充數，是十足表演懶勁的煨　貓，則非但不能殲滅鼠患，而且增加了搶食飢民糧食的嚴重性，又如之何？若是徵集得來的貓，隻隻善捕老鼠，以至有鼠患消滅的一天，這五萬頭貓是否繼續留在歐洲，代替老鼠與飢民爭食呢？還是由康且爾力把勁旅召歸，貓頭頸裏掛一塊獎牌「以飾有功」呢？電文裏沒有明言，糊塗如我者不得不設此二問。</p>
<p>歐洲飢民的實際情形，因爲孤陋寡聞，不獲知某詳情。但旣然稱爲飢民，懸想隔宿之糧是一定沒有的了。就是留着一點，大致不肯放在桌上過夜，以供老鼠之一飽，所以歐洲老鼠爭食的對象不是饑民，倒是染着酒肉臭味的「朱門」！換言之，「朱門」才會想到畜貓來捕鼠，飢民們是不會把他們僅有的黑麵包，去餵了一隻貓，使牠精神抖擻地在夜間去捕捉偷吃黑麵包的老鼠！這是繼「貸款一百元與需要救濟的國家」之後的又一「哈哈」。</p>
<h3>房屋獎券</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>房屋義賣券成爲近來中下階級小市民們的公餘飯後談話資料，公務負敎師小職員甚至學生工人，誰都人手一券，對這一紙比五千元關金大上二倍印刷精良的獎劵，懷着無限的憧憬。莫小覷了它，不久的將來也許値上好幾條金條呢。固然拾念萬元錢算不上什麽，但在月入百餘萬的人們看來，可也得省上一二個月才凑得起來，三四個同事隨便閒談，從加薪水調整待遇以及年賞分紅談起，最後當大家都唉聲嘆氣的時候，便不由得掬出那張獎劵，於是一陣希望在心頭掠過，話題就傳到房子上來，也許甲有了女朋友正爲着找不起房子發愁，乙新添了孩子　得亭子間轉不過身，丙雖是獨身漢，然而房子就是鈔票呀，年　不是還要償還一筆不大不小的　　嗎？多買一張獎券，便多增一分希望。每天不再坐電車，安步當車吧，替毛頭少買一磅奶粉，勉强吃些奶糕吧，連一個鐘點睡　　寫一篇稿子吧，只要幸而中獎，就可以乘人力車上辦公處，買魚肝油牛肉汁，甚至在寒夜裏生上一盆炭火了。</p>
<p>這正是「一舉兩得」的善舉，，很多人對房屋義買券下着這樣的斷語，中了彩，自不用說，即使不中，譬如捐款，受惠的還是難胞。</p>
<p>幾十萬張獎劵中有一個希望，幾百萬人都憧憬着這一個希望，得彩的或然率幾等於零，一二個幸運兒的希望兌了現，千千萬萬人的希望落了空。落了空又算什麼呢，十念萬元錢不够吃上一餐西菜，不够喝上一口洋酒。然而够乘上一個月的公共汽車呀，十二月的天氣，西北風夾着雪片，公共汽車不是又暖又快嗎？够早上多吃一團粢飯呀，空着肚子上辦公室可眞不是味兒。够給孩子買上一磅奶粉呀，毛頭不是瘦得像一隻猴子了麼？</p>
<p>救濟是好事，時屆歲暮年尾，掃興話少說爲妙，還是敬祝各位能够鴻視齊天，中上一個頭獎吧！</p>
<h3>結繩而治</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>區額有用成語如倉頜祠日「始制文字」，諸葛孔明祠日「丞相祠堂」等最爲切貼。清時崑山歸元恭先生，狂士也，嘗於除夕署其門曰：「一槍戳出窮鬼去，雙鈎搭進當神來。」其不經多類此。時人呼之爲「　　」。家貧甚，　破至不可　，椅敗至不可坐，則俱以繩縳之，而書其臘日「結繩而治」。開者無不絕倒。</p>
<h3>初試新裝</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>西服店內的夥計將我定製的一套新西服送來。我脫下　的絲棉袍子，初試新裝，另有一種全身煥然一新的感覺。連帶我想起了若干穿西服的小經驗，信筆寫來，讀者諸公視爲愚者一得讀之可也。</p>
<p>記得我穿最初幾套西服的時候，一則因爲「改裝」不久，還不懂得穿西服的「三眜」,二則因為那時對於「物力艱難」，尚無深切的體會，因此，穿西服的時候，十分隨便，往往在袋中塞了許多東西，如烟盒，皮夾，火柴，手帕，糖果，筆記薄等，高高的鼓了起來。有一次，我更吃了大虧，在袋中放了一包淸眞敎門茶食店製的「鷄肉餃」，逗起老鼠的食慾，咬成兩個窟窿。</p>
<p>我又歡喜把雙手塞在上裝和長褲袋內，以致衣服容易走樣，綫縫易於裂開。我所見到的許多年輕人，似乎與我有同樣癖好。他們當然不能留給人家衣履整齊的印象。</p>
<p>再者，我的褲子，繫得很低，日子一久，儘管褲管上襯着貼邊，不免磨損，褲管邊上的羊毛纖維裂了開來，顯得很難看，加上平時我不大注意坐的姿勢，一會將兩腿伸直，一會將身軀倚向後背，隔不了一二星期，褲子後面，磨成油光光的一片。</p>
<p>有時，我穿了一套新西服，不顧天氣的惡劣，闖了出去，給雨淋濕了回來。也有些時候，在一件闞肩胛的西服上，將一件嫌小的大衣穿上去，穿了一二次後，裏面的西服頓時改樣了。</p>
<p>這幾年來，隨著物價的高漲，每月薪金收入與購買力的距離，日益拔開。要購置一套新西服，一天一天的來得吃力，而愛惜的程度，也日益加深，目前我的衣櫉內，運新製的在內，一共有五套西服，看來和新的一樣，數量自然很少，但是只要我隨時留意，想來可以加倍耐穿吧。</p>
<h3>金璧輝二三事</h3>
<p>— 叔愚</p>
<p>說起「金璧輝」三個字，大家也許尙感生疏，但是一提起「川島芳子」這個名子，我想大家就要比較熟悉了。原來金璧輝是曾因革新淸政，釋放汪精衛及後謀復辟未成，逃亡日本的前淸肅政王善耆的女兒，三歲喪父，母亦殉節，於是即被受託孤之重的日人川島浪速携到日本撫育起來，給她取名爲川島芳子。</p>
<p>川島浪速曾受淸廷厚遇，剏辦中國警政，與肅淸王爲莫逆交，是一個親華的「中國通」。他因自己無子女，遂視金如己出，服以男裝，敎以騎射之術，課外並常作中日親善等說之灌輸。金璧輝從小就受他義父嚴格的忠君愛國的敎育，遂打定了她日後的飛揚跋扈的根基。</p>
<p>但是肅親王的兒女並不止金璧輝一個，（據說有男八女二共十個之多）當初全都託付了川島。金幼而卓楚，在過四歲的生日時，他義父問她耍什麽，她答要天下，遂得川島的重視，於是單單把她一個留在身邊敎養着，其餘九個，都給分散在別處撫養，平日不相見面，並且還不讓金璧輝知道此事。一直到十歲時，她哥哥憲開吿訴她是中國人，到十五歲「九一八」發生，日本的中國留學生向日木政府責問：日政府大捕留學生，是時金亦參加其間，還同被拘禁，押了三個多月方出來，她纔恍悟己身爲中國人而蓄心回國。</p>
<p>民國廿一年（即在「九一八」發生的翌年）春天，她才是十六歲的小姑娘，一天放學後，竟偸偸地上了輪船跑到了上海。這便是她脫離家庭，學校而展開了錯綜複雜變幻無常的社會生活的第一慕，也就是她在一生思想上的絕大的一個轉變。在上海住了四個月，正好她的庶兄金璧東從東北趕到上海，把她接到長春（當時爲偽滿洲國的首都，稱新京），據說她到那時才知道自己是愛新覺羅氏的後裔，於是跑到熱河去上墳，並到過長白山出生之地。</p>
<p>在她「波浪萬丈」的一生中曾有三次被騙，恐非一般人所深知，但却都與她的命運有密切的關繫。</p>
<p>最初的被騙，就如上所述的被川島蒙蔽，使她一直到十六歲，方才曉得自己的眞來歷。</p>
<p>第二次的受騙，便是她受她哥哥金璧東的懇託，引了五千名定國軍往長白山，圖謀擁兵扶植　室，把溥儀迎回熱河。但因事前未與日軍部取得聯絡，致被日軍用飛機轟炸，强迫解散。彼時日軍司令多田佯允接濟軍火，用專車誘返長春，其事遂寢。</p>
<p>其後，蘇炳文反正，她竟又不使人知，只留下一封信，駕飛機到滿洲里，跳傘下去，擬向蘇說降。當被蘇軍扣押的日本人都跑返了日本時，地面日軍就開始總攻繫起來，把她一個人留在蘇軍中，　她機警，竟在蒙古帳蓬中躱藏脫險，遄赴天津去開「東興樓」飯莊了。　末一次的受騙可說是最危險的一次，幾乎連性命也被陰險狡猾的日軍斷送了。</p>
<p>有一次，與日寇北平軍司令部報道部部長山家享鬧翻。山家原是川島浪速的書億，後被斥逐，在北平虐民歛財，頗爲金所不滿，忽然想出了一個「日本式家主的方式」來處罰了山家，大大地下了他的台。山家懷恨報復，向她下了逐出全中國的「追放令」，在日本九州大學醫院中過了幽禁的生活逹二年之久。</p>
<p>金璧輝一生的夢想，是想借重日本的勢力來恢復滿淸的帝王之業，其　生精力，亦盡瘁於斯，但是抗戰的結果，日本是打敗了，她的夢想也隨之如泡影般地毁滅了。她於民國三十四年十月十一日在北平就逮，監禁已逾兩年。河北高等法院以漢奸罪判處極刑，不服，正向最高法院請求覆判，她會說：「生於蠱惑，死於蠱惑，此即余之一生也」，面對着森嚴國法，她又何能再施什麽「蠱惑」呢！</p>
<h3>談哭</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>哭的方式不一，如有淚無聲呌做泣，有聲無淚呌做號，有淚有聲呌做啼。不過話說溜了嘴，就統呌做哭了。</p>
<p>哭，應該是一種眞情流露。人逢到悲痛或哀傷之際常情不自禁的出諸一哭，號淘躃踊，發洩無遣；但高興逾份的時候，也常會眼淚盈眶，喜極而啼。</p>
<p>不過，啼哭一事，在男子漢是不經常有的。俗語「男子眼淚如金，女子眼淚如水」，這話雖然含有輕女重男的封建意味，但實際情形也是如此，女人的確比男人通常要會哭一點，其原因無非是男性的感情比較經得住熬練，受得起風浪，不比女性那麼脆弱底緣故。只是也有例外，遇到某種塲合，或許男子們哭起來會比女性還要厲害，更加沉痛。那便是「英雄有淚不輕彈，只因未到傷心處」者是。</p>
<p>遠如戰國時代的申包胥在秦庭乞師，一連涕哭了九日，不食不眠，結果終於將秦王哭動了心，允許借兵去規復故國，纔終止了他的哭，申包胥可算是個懂得哭的道理底人，他這樣痛哭不休，自然是一種手段，但他這樣做，一方面固由於他曾跟伍員打下更道，爲實行「子能覆楚，我必復楚」的諾言；另一方面也未嘗不是因爲故國覆滅，而淚出痛腸，傷心萬分也。否則，何來如此持久眼淚？</p>
<p>這哭的故事因爲發生的時代甚早，更因爲申包胥的一突居然頒來救兵，達成復國的心願，所以很爲一般後人所景仰和贊許。後來，照三國演義說，梟雄如劉備，當魯子敬奉令來向他索還荆州的時候，也效申包胥的辦法，以一付「急淚」，換得子敬的同情，使他「空入寳山」，廢然而返。此固由於子敬的存心忠厚，也可見哭的魔力之偉大。無怪乎十九世紀末葉，歐洲人的洋槍大砲已打入中國之際，猶有滿人文悌者相信哭可以退敵，欲做申包胥第二。史　文悌初於俄國强租旅順大連之時，自請赴俄辯論，謂將痛哭流涕，效法申包胥九日不食，倘俄國固執，立即自盡，庶爾感動英日而助我。他在奏摺裏並說「奴才無父母在堂，妻妾在室，以死報國，蓄志巳久，死得其所，可以感動地球萬國。」幸　光緒皇帝還稍有頭腦，不曾允許，否則這個笑話你就鬧得不小了。食古不化，也是够危險的事情呢！</p>
<p>日前報載，江海關貪汚案在京公審，三主角尹蘭蓀，張寳匯，岳新民都不約而同地演了一次「哭庭」的好戲。一個是「淚下如注，咽不成聲」，另一個是「語帶哭聲」；最後一個是「涕淚潛然」。都一致「悔不該上了商人的當」，可謂精彩之至！只是，不管他們是「淚出痛腸」，或是故意做作，而他們的動機則一，無非各想以「眼淚」來示懺悔，以期打動法官們的慈悲心，減輕其罪行而已，無知法律　　，難於違背，法官們雖然心存忠厚，恐怕也無能為力？「一失足成千古恨」，傾長江之水也已難於洗刷了，則區區之眼淚，又何能爲力啊！</p>
<h3>瑛岳憶</h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>我去年二月在上海，從巴金兄那裏知道岳瑛已死了，而且死了好幾年了，並且就死在上海。我時常想起他，總想寫一點什麽來紀念他，因爲他是一個平常的人；大約就因為他是一個平常的人的緣故罷，所以我想念他，再說他也是我們朋友中一個很可愛的朋友。第一次我知道他是民國十九年，讀了他在新女性月刊上譯的工女馬德蘭；和他見面是二十一年在巴黎。那時他住在比樣谷（Billancourf）的一個旅館裏，我現在已記不起我是怎樣和他見面的，因為我住在阿爾格意（Arouil）那兒的朋友沒有一個和他認織的。自從和他見面後，我每禮拜總要去看他一次，這樣的情形一　到我離開巴黎去佈魯塞爾爲止，到佈魯塞爾後我記得我們還通過一兩次信。那時他在比樣谷附近的一個玻璃廠作工，這個玻璃廠是專作刻花的，就是在玻璃的製成品上刻花。出品大部分出口，以去英國和美國爲主。他常和我說他回國後想招集一點資本；開一個玻璃刻花工廠，這不但是一種賺錢的工業，而且是一稱藝術。我很鼓勵他，但我忘了中國連平面玻璃灰還做不好，那裏談得到那樣高貴的玻璃製造。我們見面除了談刻花玻璃之外，偶然的還談起讀書，譯書，養熱帶魚及他的一些零碎胡戀愛。他養了兩尾熱帶魚，是他的廠主送給他的，大約半年以後，他的熱帶魚已繁殖好幾尾了。這是他頂得意的事，他在法國住了十幾年，他始終沒有結婚，但他的女朋友不少，而且有各式各樣的，所以我說是一些零碎的戀愛。他的身體很壞。他回國以後的情形，據巴金兄說：在上海不很得意，在一個什麼銀行工作了一些時，還開了一陣子飯館，這到是出乎我意外的。他回國後不久就生病，以後不久就死了。在法國玻璃刻花是一個新興工業，法國人明白這種技術的也不大多，在目前說中國人恐怕祗有岳瑛一個。他回國後，沒有一個機會給他發展一下他的技術，是很可惜的，說是中國社會埋沒了他也不過份。其實被埋沒的又何止岳瑛一人呢。</p>

<p>章老太太道：「像你這樣畏頭畏尾，什麼事也辦不動了。」雲卿道：「娘，你得想一想，這事由我們吿訴渚齋的父親，就說他老人家全聽我們的話，阻止渚齋和綺紈結婚，事情也都辦到了，以後的事該怎麼辦？渚齋見我們破壞他的好事，對我們是作如何感想？再這事若由旁人看來，這全盤棋子是由我們布置，裏裹外外都不討好，我們爲什麼操這分心呢！」章老太太道：「據你這樣說來，是事不干已，可以不管了，那末，你何必整天唉聲嘆氣。你把這事看開，我也不着急呀！」雲卿聽了，默然不語。因爲她心裹只是想着，事情鬧到這地步，她是不能露面的，一露面必招渚齋的怨恨，種下惡因，將來總沒有好結果。這種苦處，一時又說不出口，那一晚又澈夜沒睡。想到最後，忽然想到費肖柏是渚齋的姑丈，渚齋的父親，和他最要好，若由他說去，一定很有效果。肖柏思想很細，由他處置這事，必能辦得很周到。雲卿想到費肖柏，似乎得了一位救星，知肖柏每天必須四點以後，才能起床，那天等到四點多鐘，雇車來到費宅，肖柏剛起床不久，肖柏和章老太太也是中表之親，雲卿從前愛硏究戲曲，常來食柏家裏請敎，肖柏喜歡她聰明穩事，愛惜備至，這天雲卿走進院內，肖柏正在迴廊上逗鸚鵡，一眼看見雲卿進來，笑道：「你來正好，帮帮忙，我敎她唱探母，牠只學一句，便不學了，你來，你唱兩句逗他，你是生人，聲音又脆，牠一定會學的。」雲卿和道肖柏的脾氣，呌你幹，你須馬上就幹，他才非常高興，若是推三阻四，他便要發脾氣，不呌幹了。今天滿心難過，本無心情唱戲逗鸚鵡，但此來有求於肖柏，不得不曲意奉承，便笑道：「呌我唱那一段呢？」肖柏道：「不要唱一段，祗唱兩句：「艷陽天，春光好，百鳥歡喧」。「雲卿果然背着險唱了這兩句，祗見那鸚鵡把頭東看西看，兩隻眼睛，似在尋覓什麼。</p>

<p>乙：（焦急地）你已在各處仔細尋搜過了嗎？</p>
<p>甲：當然，世界上每一個大工業區我都搜尋過了。你可知道現在全世界所有的香烟足够我們吸二千萬年，許多香烟廠都沒有受到破壞，但是火柴工廠却都已炸得乾乾凈凈一家也不勝了。</p>
<p>丙：馬德里的大火還在燒嗎？</p>
<p>乙：安加拉怎樣？</p>
<p>甲：哦，都還在燒着呢！</p>
<p>乙：那便好，我們可以用這火來做火種，用不着火柴了</p>
<p>丙：別說　話，它們不會永遠燒下去的啊！你看紐約吧，祗燒了兩年。我們一定要立刻討論這火柴的問題，這件事對於將來有很大的關係！</p>
<p>乙：這裏還有更重要的問題要討論呢！譬如說，土地的分配怎樣？</p>
<p>甲：對啊！我們一定要商討決定一下這問題。（對丙）我們舉你爲大會的主席。</p>

<p>乙：歐洲與亞洲。</p>
<p>丙：（激怒地）那末臉下來給我的祗有北美洲了！</p>
<p>甲：別傻吧，北美洲是以前美國的所在地，是世界上最富的大洲；這塊大陸上本來有一萬七千多萬人口，難道給你一個人還嫌不够？</p>
<p>乙：好吧，格林蘭也給你</p>
<p>丙：不行，這種條件是談不來的！</p>
<p>乙：大家靜靜，我們千萬不能使危機擴大。（對丙）北美洲旣大且富，兩面又有海洋保護，多麽理想呢！我之要歐洲是因爲它是到亞洲的戰略上的緩衝，所以不能放染，這完全是爲了要防衛疆界原故。</p>
<p>丙：（對甲）那末你爲什麽不將南美洲讓給我呢？</p>
<p>甲：我又不是傻瓜，且別忘了我在獲得最後勝利上所貢獻的力量啊！（未完）</p>

The remnants were forced to break into smaller units, and the National Army is continuing to search and suppress them. Since the 13th of this month, up to today (31st), the old nests of the northern Jiangsu bandits, which they have painstakingly managed for years, such as Dazhongji, Sancanghe, Shenmenkou, Badoushan, and Kushuiyang, have been thoroughly eliminated, and all secretly stored materials of the bandits have been seized.

It is expected that this annihilation battle will be concluded within days, and a detailed battle report will be issued at that time. When reporters asked about the war situation in western Hubei, Xu smiled and said: There are only three to five hundred scattered bandits harassing between Jingmen and Dangyang.

<h3>Gandhi's Death is a World Tragedy; Chairman Sends Telegram to Nehru Condoling; Luo Jialun Sends Condolences on His Behalf</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] The death of Mahatma Gandhi caused a more widespread wave of shock and mourning in Nanjing on the 31st. Chairman Chiang and his wife, President Zhang, Foreign Minister Wang, President Dai, and Education Minister Zhu all sent telegrams to Nehru to express their condolences. President Zhang, on behalf of Gan Miweinaiguang, External Affairs Vice Minister Ye Gongchao, Department Director Ling Qihan, and Zhu Jiahua (Chairman of the China-India Society), also personally went to the Indian Embassy to express their condolences. The telegram from Chairman Chiang and his wife read: "Deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the assassination of Mr. Gandhi. This generation of sacred fighters advocating non-violence to achieve human peace was brutally murdered by violence, which is truly a world tragedy and heartbreaking. The Chinese people and we respectfully extend our sincere condolences to Your Excellency and the family of Mr. Gandhi, the Congress Party, and the Indian people. Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling". Note: Chairman Chiang and his wife met with Gandhi on September 18, 1942, and had a pleasant conversation for the entire afternoon until midnight, which was the longest time the Chairman had ever met with any individual. During the meeting, the Chairman expressed his admiration for the Mahatma and praised his efforts for national independence. The Chairman assured that China would do its best to help India to become one of the world's independent and powerful nations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 30th Special Dispatch] Today, our ambassador to India, Luo Jialun, visited Nehru on behalf of Chairman Chiang and the diplomatic corps here, expressing deep sorrow and condolences for Gandhi's assassination. Luo then went to Birla House to pay his last respects to the Mahatma's remains. Luo paid the most respectful three bows to the remains according to Chinese etiquette. Luo accused the assassination as "an extreme crime, which is not only so to India, but also an extreme crime to all mankind." When asked by reporters what kind of remarks he wanted to make, he replied: "Although Gandhi is dead, his spirit is immortal!" (News about Gandhi's cremation and riots in Mumbai will be published on the third page)</p>
<h3>Prayer Meeting at the Indian Embassy; Chargé d'Affaires Ismail Reads Memorial Speech</h3>
<p>"We Wish to Follow His Path to Reach Our Destination" [Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] A reporter visited the Indian Embassy at 5:00 PM and saw Mrs. Menon, the ambassador's wife, leading the singing of elegies in the hall. Chargé d'Affaires Ismail and Menon's secretary all wore expressions of sorrow and mourned the great father of their country, who had suffered such a great loss, in a low voice. At about 6:00 PM, Indians in Nanjing gathered in the embassy hall, about eighty men and women, barefoot and sitting cross-legged. A long table was set up in front of the hall, on which an oil painting of Gandhi wearing a white shirt was enshrined. In front of the portrait, there was a pair of red candles and five white candles. First, a radio was borrowed to listen to the broadcast from Delhi. At 6:30 PM (4:00 PM Delhi time), when the ceremony for the cremation of Gandhi's remains began, a memorial prayer meeting began. First, four people stood up one after another and recited scriptures to the right of the table. Then, Chargé d'Affaires Ismail read a memorial speech, which roughly said: "Yesterday was the darkest day in Indian history. Today, the body of Mahatmaji (Gandhi's name) will return to the earth. Mahatmaji has passed away and will no longer lead his prayer ceremony. This is what we cannot believe, but it is true. It would be fortunate if he had not passed away, but he still had great work to do. Without him, we are like walking in the darkness. May those who know him deeply continue his will. This is not comforting, everything is lost. "The whole world is mourning for him. Only the greatness of Mahatmaji, I cannot reveal the mystery. We can only learn lessons from the outline of his life. Every breath of him is tuned to truth, and every word is harmonious and inseparable. Even today, if he were still here, he would be asked what he would do? He would not be unremittingly released from this assassination event, but only instruct us to continue his unfinished wishes; We follow the light he lit, and follow his path, until the final destination that he wants to take us to for life."</p>
<p>After Ismail finished his speech, everyone stood in silence. Then, four people went to the right side of the spirit table one after another to read eulogies or sing elegies, and clasped their hands together as a salute. Finally, the whole body beat the festival and sang an elegy, and dispersed in the atmosphere of solemnity. It was already 8:30, the night outside was heavier, and the wet and cold was pressing. The red, white, and green silk Indian flag was still statically half-hanging on the roof flagpole, and the Suolun, which symbolized Gandhi's spirit in the flag's center, was also obscured by darkness.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Mourns</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Sends Shen Zonglian to the Indian Consulate to Offer Condolences [Report from this newspaper] The shocking news of the assassination of Indian Mahatma Gandhi by thugs has been received, and all circles in the city are in shock and mourning.

Shen Zonglian also issued a eulogy, saying: "Gandhi's assassination, Yu and the city government colleagues are shocked. Gandhi's death is deeply regrettable. This is not only the loss of his family and India, but also the loss of the entire world."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Indian Overseas Chinese Commemorate Mahatma; Sutra Recitation Meeting Held Yesterday and Today</h3>
<p>People of All Ethnic Groups Abandon Prejudices and Participate</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian overseas Chinese in the city held a sutra recitation meeting at the Indian Church on Baoxing Road at 3:30 PM on the 31st. In addition to Indian Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis, etc., were able to temporarily abandon their prejudices and gather together to worship this philosopher who fought for India's independence and died for it. The scriptures recited in the memorial service were those often recited by Gandhi during his lifetime prayers. In front of the altar, there were piles of Indian scriptures covered with brocade. After a moment of silence to express condolences, Muslims stood up and loudly recited the Koran to commemorate this great man of different beliefs. The Indian overseas Chinese who participated had no organization at the time, but the number of those who gathered without prior agreement was more than fifty, and Princess Samir of a certain Indian native state was also present. The expressions on their faces were all sad and pious, and some were shedding tears. The entire memorial ceremony ended at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>This morning at 9:00, the Indian Church will hold a scripture recital meeting again to express condolences. The Indian Chamber of Commerce in the city will hold a formal memorial service tomorrow (2nd). The Sino-Indian Cultural Association will also hold a meeting in the short term to commemorate, and people from all walks of life in the city will participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi Personally Writes Antithetical Couplet; Hu Shi Sends Telegram to Offer Condolences</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party and a member of the National Government, was deeply saddened when he heard the news of Gandhi's assassination while sick, and personally wrote an antithetical couplet: "The world admires Youlong, what kind of madman" only assassinates the saint! Dedicate oneself to feed tigers, bow one's head to worship this person all one's life." Zeng told reporters: He had great admiration for Gandhi. On Gandhi's birthday last year, he handed over his old work "Postscript to the Biography of Gandhi", written in official script, to Gandhi as a gift, which was forwarded by Indian Ambassador Menon.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 31st] Hu Shi telegraphed the Indian Embassy in Nanjing on the 31st to express condolences to Gandhi, saying: "I feel deeply saddened by the death of Gandhi, which is an irreparable loss to the Indian people." Hu told reporters: "Gandhi's death will not increase the conflict between India and Pakistan, but may reduce and eliminate the crisis between India and Pakistan because of the appeal of Gandhi's great spirit." He said that Gandhi was a kind of magic. With his so thin and weak, he led India to independence, but only a nation with religious enthusiasm can produce Gandhi. May I ask which politician can use his own hunger strike as a political weapon? China cannot produce Gandhi. The Confucian and Mencian doctrines of two thousand years are still almost the same as what ordinary people say today. It can be said that they are very worldly and very different from the problems discussed by Indian philosophers. Finally, Hu commented that the success of Gandhi's non-violent doctrine lies in the law-abiding spirit of the Anglo-Saxon nation.</p>
<h3>Indian Students at Peking University; Held Evening Prayer Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 31st] After the bad news of Gandhi's death spread here, the eleven Indian students at Peking University were extremely sad. At 6:15 this evening, they held evening prayers for Gandhi and invited Hu Shi to participate. They are research students exchanged between India and China, ten men and one woman, and are currently studying the Chinese language with all their strength at the Chinese Language School.</p>
<h3>Estimated Payment System for Profit Tax; Difficult to Change in Fact; Person in Charge of the Direct Tax Department Speaks</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] The profit tax for the 37th year will be collected on an estimated basis, six times the amount paid in the 36th year. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance's Direct Tax Department to request reconsideration. According to the person in charge of the Direct Tax Department, the method of collecting the profit tax on an estimated basis for the 37th year and collecting it at six times the amount paid in the 36th year have both been approved by the State Council, and it is impossible to change them in fact. According to price calculations, prices this year have risen by about 20 times compared to last year, and the income of merchants must also increase with prices. Calculating the estimated payment at six times is actually very reasonable. In terms of the profit tax budget, it was more than 900 billion yuan in the 36th year and 11.2 trillion yuan in the 37th year, which is also an increase of about 14 times. Therefore, it is impossible to reduce the estimated payment at six times. It is currently expected that the income from the profit tax before April of this year will be 4.5 trillion yuan, which is a considerable discount compared to the half-year profit tax budget of 5.6 trillion yuan this year. I sincerely hope that merchants can appreciate the current financial difficulties of the country, give their support, and prevent obstacles from occurring during implementation. According to estimates by the person in charge, if the estimated payment system can be successfully implemented in Shanghai, Shanghai alone can collect 3 trillion yuan, which can help reduce issuance a lot.</p>
<h3>Shenyang Mayor Jin Zhen Resigns</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Panyang, 31st] Pan Mayor Jin Zhen has resigned, and Chen Cheng has telegraphed the central government for approval. There are many rumors about the successor.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Cracks Down on Communist Bandit Organization</h3>
<p>Head of Self-Defense Corps Secretly Serves as Communist Army "Procurement Director"; Principal Offender Arrested and Admits to Purchasing and Transporting Military Supplies for Bandits</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 31st] A major Communist bandit organization was recently cracked down in the suburbs of Tianjin. The principal offenders were Mu Chenglin, the head of the self-defense corps in Mu Zhuangzi and Tianqi Temple, and Mu Chengqing, the team leader, who used their positions to secretly serve as the procurement director in Tianjin for the Communist bandit's Jizhong Military Region. This was discovered by the Inspection Department of the Tianjin Garrison Command. On the 24th, Mu Chenglin was lured and arrested, and the entire self-defense corps was disarmed. All the principal offenders have now been escorted to the Peace Preservation Headquarters. According to the investigation by the Inspection Department, Mu Chenglin and others absorbed more than 20 procurement personnel in Tianjin and purchased goods in Tianjin by means of smuggling. Then, Mu Chengqing sent armed personnel to escort them to Mu Zhuangzi, and then transported them at night with more than 30 bicycles, escorted by armed personnel to Zhengyucheng in Anci County, and then transported them to the bandit areas such as Hejian. Later, they changed to transport them to Li Ming, the chief of the production section of the Communist bandit's Jizhong Military Region, 25 miles south of Anci County, and then transported them to the bandit areas. The goods transported were mostly mercury, electric money, batteries, radios, red phosphorus (raw material for making poisonous gas), etc. The home also sheltered important personnel of the traitors who were stationed there for command. On January 21st, it was reported that Mu Xiangqi, a child carrying explosives out of the country, was found in Zhongjia Gu, who was instructed by Mu Chenglin. With the evidence being confirmed, the department lured and arrested Mu Chenglin on the 24th. Mu Chenglin has admitted to purchasing military supplies for the traitors and sheltering the traitors to sneak into Tianjin and covering up the transportation of supplies out of the country. All the other accomplices have also revealed the truth. The Inspection Department is still stepping up its investigation.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Spirit of Gandhi Lives Forever!</h3>
<p>Mr. Gandhi, the spiritual leader of India, aged seventy-eight, was assassinated on the afternoon of January 30th on his way to evening prayer, succumbing to three bullets! Gandhi's last words were "God! God!" Indian Prime Minister Nehru broadcast to the entire Indian people, declaring the 31st as a national day of mourning.</p>
<p>Mr. Gandhi, this great sage of our time, witnessing India's independence, could not bear the division of the Hindu and Muslim communities. To address the suspicion and mistrust caused by the Kashmir issue, leading to war and death, he embarked on a fast of one hundred and twenty-one hours and forty-five minutes, appealing for peace between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Thirteen days after humanity was restored and bestiality receded, this great sage of our time unfortunately died by assassination, bringing immeasurable disaster and loss to India, to humanity, and to history! Mr. Gandhi's death can be compared to that of Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Who killed this great sage of our time? A violent extremist from the Hindu faith. Who destroyed the halo of peace? A force that extinguished conscience. The evening of January 30, 1948, was the darkest moment for India, for humanity, and for history; tragic, terrifying, and shameful, filled with this moment. We mourn Gandhi, we lament the sage; we hope that Mr. Gandhi's sacred blood will cleanse the hatred and shame of the world, and that the tears of millions of people will wash away the turmoil and death in India. When Mr. Gandhi was suddenly attacked, he covered his forehead with his hand, still showing a gesture of forgiving the assassin. Although he died at the hands of this thug, his spirit should be able to bring repentance to millions of thugs. Mr. Gandhi sacrificed his life for India's freedom and peace, and will smile contentedly in the afterlife, living forever in the world!</p>
<p>Mr. Gandhi was a great sage. His life, his ideals, and his faith are the highest moral standards for humanity in this century. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, the capital of Kathiawar in western India. His family was wealthy, but he lived a life of simplicity and tranquility, working hard and unremittingly to fight for India's independence and liberation, and to advocate for the peaceful existence of mankind. Although he was a Hindu, his religious thought was broad; he believed that he himself was an instrument of God. This thought of his is consistent with that of Buddha and Jesus. The only way to approach God in one's mind and promote peace in the world is to abstain from violence. For the sake of India's independence, he was willing to sacrifice everything, but he was unwilling to achieve his goal through violence. He opposed war and opposed aggression because he believed that humanity could not establish peace on the basis of force. Seeing that the desire for leadership had already threatened world peace, he himself was unwilling to be the leader of Indian politics, so he was an extreme opponent of Stalin. He was a sage rather than a hero. He was the spiritual master of the Indian people, the halo of world peace. He was not a "power," nor would he ever use power to achieve his own ends. His thoughts and actions were based on public opinion. He was a true democrat; if he saw that his own views were not supported by public opinion, he would immediately abandon them. In his history of struggle, he was imprisoned three times, fasted fifteen times, and was assassinated four times. Now, he died by assassination after his last fast. Throughout his life, he opposed death, but he himself was not afraid of death. He had foreseen that his physical strength would decline in his old age, and that his life was like a flickering candle. He hoped that he would not die from fasting, that his hope would not be extinguished, and that he would live a little longer to continue serving humanity.</p>
<p>Most of India's nine major religions revere Mr. Gandhi. He became a symbol of India's unity. Throughout his life, he was imprisoned and fasted, all for the sake of India's independence and freedom. He opposed the partition of India and Pakistan. When India achieved independence and implemented partition, Gandhi, with his wisdom and sincerity in pursuing truth, hoped that India and Pakistan would not be divided. After the Indian and Muslim communities decided to separate, Gandhi respected public opinion and abandoned his "preconceptions." In fact, he sacrificed truth for the sake of seeking peace. When the Kashmir issue arose and the war threatened to spread throughout the territory, with division and hatred echoing each other, this great sage of our time was boundlessly saddened. He finally began his last fast on January 13. He said, "I must be satisfied to see the hearts of the people of India reunited before I am willing to stop fasting. If I should die, then let me die. It is more glorious to die than to watch India be destroyed." After one hundred and twenty-one hours and forty-five minutes, his spirit of great benevolence, great courage, great impartiality, and great wisdom finally moved the leaders of the Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim religions in India on the 18th. They listened together to the weak, warm voice of this old man before Mr. Gandhi's "deathbed": "I fear that I will not be in this world for long. I hope that Pakistan can reunite with India." He hoped that Pakistan would abandon its dominion status and merge with India to form a single country again. He hoped that all ethnic groups in India would live in harmony, coexist, and liberate the poor and helpless people. He opposed the Nehru government's submission of the Kashmir issue to the United Nations Security Council. He stopped the revengeful thoughts of extremist youths from the Hindu faith. He prayed every night, calling on the people of India and Pakistan to unite in small groups. The Hindu extremists opposed him. The so-called "anti-Gandhi movement" demonstrations and the bomb at the evening prayer meeting on January 20 were these thugs' demonstrations against Mr. Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi opposed the use of violence and bloodshed throughout his life, but he himself was not afraid of violence and bloodshed, so the tragic day of January 30 finally occurred. The ferocity of the thugs, the bestiality of the thugs, brought chaos and disaster to India. They destroyed their "Bapu" (meaning "father"), that is, they destroyed the highest moral standards they should have revered. If the people of India and Pakistan do not realize this, do not transform selfishness with impartiality, and do not use Gandhi's great benevolence and great compassion to eliminate suspicion and mistrust, then there will inevitably be even more tragic wars between India and Pakistan in the future. In short, if humanity is extinguished and bestiality is revived, a scene of mad slaughter and the repayment of thousands of generations of hatred will submerge all of India! What kind of era is this?</p>
<p>We mourn Mr. Gandhi, the great sage of our time. We do not want Indian history to suffer this tragic fate. We hope that the riots in Bombay after Mr. Gandhi's assassination can be quelled immediately. We hope that the leaders and politicians of the Indian and Muslim communities will shed tears of repentance over Mr. Gandhi's bloody corpse, pray for peace and unity before the halo of this great sage, sincerely extend their bloody hands, put into practice the last words of this great sage, and cooperate again, without splitting. If the leaders and politicians of India and Pakistan have vision, conscience, can reflect, and can repent, then Mr. Gandhi's death will save India from death, and Mr. Gandhi's bloodshed will replace the bloodshed of millions of people in India and Pakistan. When that young assassin shot Mr. Gandhi, the old man's dying voice said to him: "You have come too late!" We believe that this reactionary violence, this thief of justice, was caught at this very moment. If, after this moment, the peace and unity of India can be quickly realized, then it is not too late and not too far away.</p>
<p>The spirit of Mr. Gandhi is the spirit of India, and it is also the spirit of mankind. His life symbolizes India's peace and symbolizes mankind's peace. His unparalleled great power and moral standards should forever be the spirit of India, the spirit of mankind, the symbol of India's peace, and the symbol of mankind's peace. The halo of this great sage of our time radiates boundless light from the pool of blood, illuminating the world and mankind. May all demons and all ethnic hatreds forever retreat and disappear before the soul of this peaceful old man.</p>
<p>We pray: The spirit of Mr. Gandhi is immortal, the spirit of Mr. Gandhi lives forever!</p>

<h3>Cleveland: Leaves Shanghai for the United States</h3>
<p>Expresses farewell regrets in pre-departure remarks</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] UNRRA's China Office Director Cleveland left Shanghai for the United States by Pan American Airlines yesterday morning. Mr. Cleveland succeeded General Egerton as the director of the China Office last May. Before leaving Shanghai, he expressed that he felt quite reluctant to leave and said, "Participating in UNRRA's work has been the most satisfying experience of my life. We feel that there are still some goals that have not been achieved, but I believe that the work that has been completed in the past is worth spending a lot of money and effort on." Mr. Cleveland also said: Most of the past achievements should be attributed to the Post-War Rehabilitation and Relief Administration, and he enjoyed working with Directors Huo Baoshu and Li Chemin very much. He also stated: The success of the Custody Committee's work has a great impact on the Chinese economy. It is hoped that the materials under its management can be put to good use, as the success of this work can serve as an effective guide for the establishment of other aid organizations in China. Mr. Cleveland also stated: His position as a member of the Custody Committee was originally to represent the American International Bank, but the bank will not send a representative to take up the position for the time being. He has asked Lu Gengnasan, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Far East Economic Commission, to attend the meetings as an observer. His positions on the Finance and Fisheries Committees will be taken over by Kilpatrick and Wu Deng, respectively. To express its gratitude for Mr. Cleveland's contributions, the Custody Committee has specially requested Mr. Cleveland to serve as the committee's liaison representative in the United States.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 31st] The Trade Guidance Committee for Trade with Japan held its 11th meeting on the afternoon of the 31st, presided over by Tong Jiling, to discuss the issue of quantity restrictions on important export commodities in trade with Japan.

The Export Management Committee and other agencies have initially drafted them, and it was resolved to submit them to the review subcommittee for review.

<h3>Kowloon Walled City Residents Demand the Release of Two Arrested Representatives</h3>
<p>Request Guo Dehua to Negotiate with the Hong Kong Government</p>

<h3>Shenyang Plane Crash Tragedy: Cause of Accident Ascertained; CNA Air's Ping-Shen Flight Inaugurated</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Personnel sent by China National Aviation Corporation to Pan Yang to investigate the crash of aircraft 4747 have returned to Shanghai. Regarding the investigation results, the representative sent by the Civil Aviation Administration has submitted a detailed report to the bureau. According to the technical personnel of CNA who returned to Shanghai, the cause of the accident may be as follows: Due to the current situation, most passengers competed to board the plane. After their luggage was weighed, they used relatives and friends seeing them off to secretly pass some luggage onto the plane after boarding. During takeoff, many passengers did not follow the regulations and gathered at the tail of the plane, causing the tail to be too heavy, which was not conducive to takeoff. According to pilot Wei Si's report, no mechanical obstacles were found during takeoff, and the engine did not catch fire (not as previously reported). However, he felt that the tail of the plane was very heavy and the runway was too short. Although he managed to take off, he was forced to land and eventually caused the accident. Secondly, the wires installed in the plane were suitable for flying in tropical and temperate zones. Special types of wires must be used for flying in cold areas. CNA had already purchased them, but because the import license was repeatedly not obtained, they are still stored in the warehouse and cannot be extracted for use. Furthermore, according to the personnel of the company who returned to Shanghai, the situation of passengers in Pan Yang was quite chaotic. They did not follow the order of seating, buying tickets, and weighing. One day, a general officer and four companions forcibly boarded the plane, stating that if they were not allowed to board, they would shoot the CNA staff. The CNA Pan Yang station could not stop them and was forced to unload the mail and let them board the plane. The company authorities have urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to request the Xingyuan to send personnel to handle seat reservations and maintain order so that Pan Yang's external transportation can be maintained.</p>

<h3>"Military and Civilian Cooperation to Eradicate the Communist Bandits" - Minister Bai Broadcasts to Retired Military Officers Nationwide</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 31st] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi broadcast to retired military officers nationwide from Hankou at 8:45 pm tonight, entitled "Military and Civilian Cooperation to Eradicate the Communist Bandits." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow retired military officers across the country: This time, I, Chongxi, have been ordered to supervise the suppression of the Communist bandits in the Dabie Mountains, and have also been instructed to guide the self-defense organization training of the people in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan during the bandit suppression period. I deeply feel the great responsibility and heavy burden. Due to being tied up with military affairs, I cannot go to various places to extend my condolences to all retired military officers in person. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to explain my expectations for all of you. Looking back at the Northern Expedition in the past,</p>
<p>Glorious History. Looking back at the Northern Expedition,</p>
<p>our National Revolutionary Army, with a troop strength of less than 100,000 and weapons of less than 50,000, mostly of poor quality, our entire officers and soldiers were deeply inspired by the Three Principles of the People, displayed the revolutionary spirit, and strived to practice pragmatism and complete the revolution. Under the leadership of the Supreme Commander, we fought bravely and advanced relentlessly, ultimately defeating more than a million counter-revolutionary forces of the warlords with fewer troops and more victories. This is truly a brilliant and splendid historical achievement in the revolutionary process. During the War of Resistance against Japan, we relied on our loyal and brave officers and soldiers to obey the orders of the Supreme Commander, support the national policy of resistance, and confront the enemy with inferior equipment with one heart and one mind, sacrificing and fighting for eight years. In the end, we were able to cooperate with the Allied forces, defeat the common enemy, win the final glorious victory, and abolish the unequal treaties of the past century, so that our international status could be improved. Such arduous and outstanding achievements from the Northern Expedition to the War of Resistance are certainly the supreme price obtained through the war with the heads and hot blood of countless martyrs, and also the immortal result of the past efforts and struggles of our surviving officers. Moreover, it is the greatest contribution to being loyal to the country, filial to the nation, and to the peace of the world. Here, we should express our sincere condolences to the deceased martyrs, and express our supreme respect to the loyal and brave officers who survived hundreds of battles.</p>
<p>Suppressing Bandits. Originally, after winning the victory of the eight-year arduous War of Resistance against Japan, the country could engage in restoration and construction, and the military and civilians could get a chance to recuperate and rest. However, the Communist bandits, relying on their illegal armed forces, disrupted everywhere, violated military and government orders, and destroyed peace and unity, causing our restoration and construction work to be greatly hindered. After eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the compatriots in various places were freed from the oppression of the enemy and puppet regimes, but they were again subjected to the rape, abuse, and looting of the Communist bandits. Their crimes of harming the country and endangering the people were exposed without reservation, and they even openly launched a full-scale rebellion. Their ambition is to subvert the National Government and ruin the country and the nation. In order to maintain the unity of the country and save the compatriots in the bandit areas from the depths of misery, the central government had to take military action and implement the suppression of bandits. Since the government issued the General Mobilization Order in July last year, it has clearly expressed its determination to suppress the rebellion. Under this goal, we must prioritize the suppression of bandits militarily, mobilize all manpower, financial resources, and material resources, implement a wartime system, exert the power of general mobilization, and eliminate banditry. Because bandit suppression solely relying on military power to defeat the main force of the bandits still cannot completely eliminate them, political, military, economic, and cultural aspects must be closely coordinated, and the military and the people must be united, and a full-scale mobilization must be carried out to form a whole combat entity, so that the overall strength can be exerted, a comprehensive tactic can be used, and the control of a wide area can be achieved, so that the bandits have no place to stand or survive, and the bandit scourge can be eradicated.</p>
<p>Organizing and Training the People. In order to make politics closely cooperate with the military, it is natural to use military power to cover politics, and at the same time, use political power to strengthen the grassroots level to assist the military. At present, the only urgent task for bandit suppression is to universally mobilize the people and establish local self-defense armed forces to cooperate with the national army and jointly suppress the bandits. The central government recently promulgated the regulations for the organization and training of people's self-defense teams in various counties and cities, which is a measure specifically aimed at the needs of the current bandit suppression. It has clear and specific regulations on the organization and training of people's self-defense, the raising of funds for weapons and ammunition, and so on.</p>
<p>At present, the main problem we face in implementing people's organization and training and establishing local self-defense armed forces is training cadres. I believe that suppressing bandits is an inevitable obligation, and every citizen should be mobilized to protect their lives and property. At the same time, I also hope that all retired military officers will serve their hometowns and be loyal to the country.</p>
<p>Serving as Basic Cadres. Retired military officers possess the spirit and discipline of soldiers. In the past Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance against Japan, they have made meritorious contributions and experienced hundreds of battles. They are all loyal and brave men. During this period of bandit suppression, based on the friendship of loving their hometown and country, they should organize retired military officer associations in accordance with regulations to assist the local government and serve as basic cadres for the organization and training of the people. Those who participate in the work of the self-defense team, in addition to the local subsidies for staple and non-staple foods, will also be paid a monthly retirement allowance by the Ministry of National Defense from January of this year, which will be transferred by the provincial governments or district administrations at all levels to maintain their livelihoods and work with peace of mind. As for retired military officers who are not employed in the self-defense team, they will still be paid retirement allowances in two installments each year in accordance with the original regulations. I hope that retired military officers across the country will rise up, enthusiastically contribute their efforts, participate in the work of organizing and training the people under the leadership of the security commanders of each province, so that the local self-defense armed forces can be established quickly, cooperate with the national army, carry out suppression, and stabilize the local area. This is my hope for our loyal and patriotic retired military officers. I sincerely hope that all loyal and brave comrades will seize the opportunity to rise up and jointly complete the task of suppressing the rebellion.</p>

<h3>All Indian People Sobbing and Weeping, Flowers and Sandalwood Cremate Gandhi, Nehru Kneels and Kisses the Corpse Before the Funeral Pyre is Lit</h3>
<p>Funeral Procession Five Miles Long, Ceremony Extremely Solemn and Respectful</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st] Hundreds of thousands of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, and people of no religious belief formed a procession five miles long to participate in Gandhi's funeral procession. Gandhi's body, wrapped in white homespun cloth with his face exposed, was carried from Birla House to a flower-covered military vehicle by his granddaughter, Ava, his secretary, and several followers. Governor-General Mountbatten, wearing a black armband and accompanied by his two daughters, Prime Minister Nehru, Deputy Prime Minister Patel, Defense Minister Singh, and other prominent figures, all attended in person. The wreaths sent by all walks of life, including those sent by the diplomatic corps of various countries, numbered in the hundreds. As the hearse left Birla House, bugles sounded, and amid sobs and weeping, the slogan of Gandhi's victory was shouted. Along the way, people climbed onto walls and fences, some climbed onto branches, and the rest stood on both sides of the road. The hearse was pulled by personnel from the army, navy, and air force. Nehru, Patel, and Singh rode in the same car, walking alongside the party's army. As the hearse passed through the main street of Delhi, the Royal Avenue, near the Memorial Gate, many people climbed onto the statue erected in memory of King George V to get a glimpse of Gandhi's last remains. Leading the procession was a large team of Gurkha troops, followed by paratroopers, cavalry, and several military trucks, then Boy Scout troops and a women's team all dressed in white. Gandhi's body was washed with water from the Mibena River when it was placed in Birla House last night. The body was covered with flowers, and only one oil lamp was lit in the room. At the same time, carpenters and artisans worked overnight on the banks of the Mibena River to rush to build a brick enclosure, constructing the cremation site for Gandhi's remains. Today, as the hearse approached the cremation site, the area was cordoned off by air force soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder, and the crematorium, built by bricklayers and tilers, was nearly completed. Firewood was piled high on the platform. At this time, some in the crowd went from sobbing to wailing. Nehru shouted loudly for order. A woman holding a child tried to rush towards the cremation platform, but was stopped by Mrs. Mountbatten. Gandhi's body was placed into the cremation enclosure at 4:30 pm, and planes scattered flowers onto the body from the sky. Nehru stepped forward to the body and knelt to kiss Gandhi's feet. Gandhi's son, Tvedas, stood at the head end. Before long, the wood ignited, and flames spurted out from all four corners, with thick smoke obscuring the sight of the audience. After the cremation ceremony was completed, relatives, officials, tanks, and armored vehicles also returned to Delhi in succession.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 31st] Gandhi's body was cremated at 5:00 pm this afternoon. His son, Tvedas, lit the fire. The body was wrapped in flowers and placed on sandalwood for cremation, which is an Indian tradition.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 31st] When Gandhi was cremated, the smoke rose straight into the sky. The ashes remained on the banks of the Jumna River for a day and a half, and then were collected and carried to the sacred Ganges River to be scattered in the water, which is an Indian traditional custom.</p>
<h3>The Murderer Goche is Detained</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st] Goche, the murderer who executed Gandhi, is still in police custody. Police revealed that in the initial interrogation, Goche admitted that what he did was not wrong, because he believed that Gandhi's remarks and policies were contrary to the interests of Hindus. He said that he had heart disease, but he was very happy with what he did.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Pona, 31st] Police today carried out a thorough search of the residence of Goche, the murderer who assassinated Gandhi, and several houses belonging to the Indian Mahasaba (a Hindu political organization). Goche is the editor of a local "Indian World" magazine. The magazine's address is also heavily guarded by police officers.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Assassination Process: Repeatedly Called Out "God! God!" Before His Death</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu extremist on the night of the 30th, and the assassin's brutality has plunged India into sorrow and terror. Gandhi died at 12:15 am Greenwich Mean Time (8:15 am Shanghai time), with his head resting on his sixteen-year-old granddaughter, Manni Teng. He died just half an hour after the assassin, Nadu Rem, a Hindu extremist, shot him in the body with a small-caliber pistol. Gandhi was assassinated in the garden of Pala Villa, appearing before his thousand followers to lead them to a summer pagoda for his usual evening prayer meeting. Gandhi, wearing his usual linen clothes and holding a sturdy wooden staff, was a few feet away from the pagoda when the bullets were fired at him from the pagoda. He immediately fell to the ground after being shot, with his hand covering his forehead. This is the Hindu gesture of forgiving his murderer. Because the distance was not far, all three bullets hit him, one in his thigh, one in his abdomen, and one in his chest. He did not say a word before he died. Before he was shot, some people at the scene believed that he had said to the assassin, "You are too late." The assassin had been standing by the garden path, with his hands clasped in front of him, making the Hindu gesture of welcome, but in his palm was hidden a pistol, which he used to shoot Gandhi from a few feet away. The assassin fired a fourth shot, attempting suicide, but the bullet only grazed his scalp. The shooting of the pistol was like setting off a string of firecrackers. A moment later, Gandhi's followers realized what had happened. Then, they fiercely attacked the assassin, but the non-police intervened with rifle bayonets, otherwise the assassin would have been beaten into mincemeat by the followers. Gandhi was immediately carried to Pala Villa, with his head resting on his granddaughter's lap. Within a few minutes, his granddaughter said to the terrified crowd, including Indian Prime Minister Nehru: "Grandfather is dead!" Then Manni got up and sat cross-legged beside the body of the old man who sacrificed for peace and humanity, reciting Hindu scriptures that have been around for two thousand years.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 30th] Gandhi died twenty minutes after being assassinated. His last words were: "God! God!"</p>

<h3>Gandhi's Sense of Humor: Jokes Become Prophecy</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 31st] Gandhi was also quite humorous. Former United Press wartime spinner and current Evening News Manager Grover recalled an incident today. Gandhi was arrested several times for fighting for Indian freedom. Once, just after being released from prison, United Press Indian Branch President Preston Grover, his old friend, visited him first. Gandhi smiled at him and said, "Are you here? One day I enter the gates of heaven, I am sure the first person I will meet must be a United Press reporter."</p>

Prime Minister Attlee, upon receiving the news at lunchtime, immediately telegraphed Prime Minister Nehru, expressing the deepest condolences on behalf of the United Kingdom government and saying that the world felt grief at the death of this greatest servant of mankind. The newly appointed US Ambassador to India, Grady, who is currently in London en route to Delhi, expressed hope that Gandhi's tragic death would enable the people of India and Pakistan to adhere to the principles Gandhi espoused throughout his life. Upon hearing the news, the Indian High Commissioner in London immediately ordered the embassy to fly its flag at half-mast. He sat alone in the library for over an hour, then summoned more than a hundred embassy staff to report this terrible news, expressing that such crimes inflicted on this great man show that the world is in darkness. Both the upper and lower houses of Parliament immediately passed resolutions, sending telegrams of condolence to the Indian government. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated that no greater man than Gandhi had ever existed in Indian history. He fought for peace throughout his life, opposing the use of violence. People of all classes in every country in the world would feel a loss due to Gandhi's death.

He is someone the Indian people will never forget. His words and deeds not only influenced government affairs, but also shaped the spirit of the Indian people. It is unfortunate that he did not live to see the full realization of his principles, but his life's achievements will be his greatest monument. His selfless struggle is a model for Indian leaders. It is believed that people of all colors, not only the Indian people, will be moved by his sacrifice and strive for the peace that Gandhi advocated." Secretary of State Marshall telegraphed Prime Minister Nehru, expressing the shock and mourning of the entire United States, and pointed out that this proved the close ties between the Indian and American nations. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Keating moved that the House observe a moment of silence to express mourning. The New York Times issued a special edition, and the New York Herald Tribune likened Gandhi's death to Lincoln's death.</p>
<p>France: The acting President of the National Assembly, Lejeune, announced Gandhi's death, and all members of the Assembly rose and stood in silence for two minutes.

<h3>US to Sign Treaty of Friendship, Commerce with Italy</h3>
<p>US Rejects Two Soviet Protests</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 31st (Broadcast): Rome Dispatch: Italy and the United States will sign a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation on Monday. This will be the first treaty signed by the United States with a European country since the war, and the first treaty signed by Italy and the United States since the Fascist regime came to power. The Soviet Union has expressed opposition to the presence of US warships in Italian territorial waters. The Italian government has informed the Soviet Union that Italy is an independent country and that no other country has the right to interfere. The news of the signing of the treaty came at this time. The treaty will be permanent and will not have a time limit.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Official news: The US government will formally reject within 24 hours the Soviet Union's protests regarding the US use of airfields in North Africa and US warships using Italian ports.</p>
<h3>Soviet Refusal to Cooperate Makes the Work of the UN Commission Difficult</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 30th] A spokesman for the United Nations Commission on Korea announced today that the chairman of the commission, Menon, and Secretary-General Hoo Shih-tse, are expected to depart for Lake Success around February 15 to report to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly on the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the commission to carry out its work in North Korea. The spokesman also said that the United Nations resolution establishing the Commission on Korea stipulated that free elections should be held throughout Korea. Given the Soviet Union's actions, the Commission believes that it has no authority to decide whether to hold these elections only in South Korea without amending the United Nations resolution. The weekly mail train from Pyongyang brought a reply from Colonel-General Terentii Shtykov, commander of the Soviet occupation zone, to Menon. Menon's letter requested the Soviet authorities to assist the work of the commission. The fact that the reply has not been made public is sufficient to confirm the news of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate. The Commission was originally scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on the 31st to discuss the wording of its report to the United Nations, but this has been postponed until next week because the French representative, Pengu, is currently absent.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission Reaffirms US Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 30th] General McCoy, the US representative and Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission, issued the following statement in response to recent newspaper reports aimed at revealing the state of discussions within the Commission, which are inevitably inaccurate or even completely distorted: "I, as Chairman, wish to clarify that no member state of the Far Eastern Commission has attempted to 'obstruct consideration' of the issue of increasing the number of member states of the Commission, or any other suggestion.</p>
<p>Regarding the demilitarization of Japan, as clarified in the Secretary-General's report to the press last July, the Commission has been actively discussing this topic for months in order to establish principles based on the relevant sections of the Commission's basic policy agreement. During these discussions, representatives of various countries have made suggestions from time to time, which naturally reflect different viewpoints. Regarding this issue, as with other issues, negotiations have been ongoing in the Commission in order to reach an agreement among the Allied nations. I, as the US representative, presented a statement to the Commission last week regarding the Japanese economy, which has since been made public. The US government recognizes that the cooperation of the Far Eastern Commission and its member states is necessary for the successful completion of the plan to create a self-sufficient economy in Japan. US policy toward Japan, whether political or economic, is aimed at creating conditions for maintaining peace. Allied cooperation through the Far Eastern Commission is an important part of this policy."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] Major General McCoy, the US representative to the Far Eastern Commission, today categorically denied that he himself or any other representative of the Commission had "obstructed consideration" of the various proposals recently submitted to the Commission by the Soviet Union. McCoy's statement was in response to the news that the newly arrived Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, has launched a "strong campaign" to limit MacArthur's implementation of occupation policies in Japan and to demand the continued demilitarization of Japan. In his official statement, McCoy reaffirmed US support for the Far Eastern Commission as a "key part" of Allied cooperation, and said that recent press reports about the discussions within the Far Eastern Commission contained inaccurate and confusing insinuations. However, he made an exception for a report claiming that McCoy had "obstructed" the voting on a proposal submitted by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin, which argued that MacArthur should be ordered to dismantle all of Japan's military facilities within six months and to destroy within three months all personnel files of Japanese military personnel. McCoy acknowledged that there were differences of opinion among the representatives of the Commission regarding the demilitarization of Japan, but he pointed out that although the views were different, there was still an atmosphere of full friendship. Personal relations between the representatives remained extremely harmonious. McCoy went on to discuss the rumors that the Soviet Union opposed the inclusion of Pakistan as a member of the Commission, saying that no representative in the Commission had obstructed the consideration of this proposal. Reporters learned that the above news originated from the weekly meeting of the Far Eastern Commission held yesterday. At that time, the Soviet representative presented a proposal regarding the demilitarization of Japan, requesting that the meeting discuss it. According to well-informed sources, the proposal aroused the usual debate, which involved differences of opinion between the United States and the Soviet Union, but there was no conflict between the US and Soviet representatives. As a result, no decision was made or vote taken on the issue.</p>

<h3>Hull's Memoirs—Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance</h3>
<p>— Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>When I stepped over the threshold of the State Department, the fact that the Latin American republics were already entering a state of flux further intensified the deteriorating situation in the Western Hemisphere. One of the most intense wars in the history of the New World (referring to North and South America), the Chaco War, was raging in the wilderness mountains and forests between Paraguay and Bolivia. Colombia and Peru had already experienced border conflicts, with the potential to escalate into a real war. In Cuba, the dictatorial government of General Gerardo Machado, after enduring twelve years, was beginning to crumble; revolution was brewing.</p>
<p>Before me was the Pan-American Conference scheduled to be held in Montevideo at the end of the year. This conference should have been held in December 1932, but at that time, because the hope for effective cooperation in the Western Hemisphere was so dim, it was decided to postpone it for a year. Now, there were repeated talks of postponing it again.</p>
<p>The whole outlook was extremely bleak, seemingly disheartening. Therefore, I understood that if the Good Neighbor Policy advocated by President Roosevelt were to be implemented, it would not be easy, especially in the Western Hemisphere. But this fact was also a challenge, enough to stir our courage.</p>
<p>Long before March 4th, I had decided that one of the principles we should adhere to in dealing with Latin America should be strict adherence to the principle of non-interference, like adhering to religious beliefs.</p>
<p>The situation in Cuba did indeed give us reason to worry. The hatred of the people towards General Machado's brutal dictatorship was growing. It was already very obvious that unless Machado resigned, the revolution would force him out. Bombings and shootings occurred endlessly in Havana, sugar factories and sugarcane fields were burned down, schools were closed, and the guerrillas left over from the unsuccessful revolution in 1931 were operating in the mountains. Political prisoners were pouring into the United States. In addition to political unrest, there was also economic hardship, partly due to the high tariff policy of the United States. The whole situation was extremely precarious.</p>
<p>According to the so-called Platt Amendment of the 1903 treaty, the United States had the right to intervene in Cuba to ensure Cuba's independence or to maintain a government strong enough to guarantee life, property, and individual liberty. But the President and I decided that we would never interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. Although we had the legal right, such action would only worsen the relationship between the entire Latin America and our country. It would overturn all our previous declarations of non-interference and would create an excuse for our traditional enemies, and my hope was to ensure that these enemies could find no excuse.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt and I agreed to send Welles to Cuba as an ambassador, and if the Cuban parties expressed willingness, he could try to mediate in the capacity of a presidential mediator. Based on the President's suggestion and my approval, Welles was appointed as Assistant Secretary of State on April 6, 1933. He had good abilities and experience, and was quite ambitious. In later years, our judgments differed greatly. In the early years, on important policy issues, I also felt that I agreed with my other colleagues more often than with Welles. Of course, I should bear the responsibility for all decisions, and in every situation, I always tried my best.</p>
<p>In May 1933, Welles set off for Cuba, carrying with him the instructions I issued on May 1, which stated: "You should always remember that the relationship between the U.S. government and the Cuban government is a relationship between autonomous, independent, and equal states, and no steps should be taken that would make it seem necessary for the U.S. government to exercise the formal right of interference, which is granted to the United States by the current treaty between the two countries." I instructed him to give all assistance to Cuba within his ability to improve the economic situation, negotiate trade agreements with Cuba, provide friendly mediation, and sincerely express to President Machado that we hoped he would take steps to end the state of terror.</p>
<p>On August 12, General Machado asked for leave of absence, and the next day, former Secretary of State Dr. Carlos de Caspedes formed a coalition government. After Machado's departure, the chaos expanded, and incidents of attacks on life and property occurred everywhere. President Roosevelt sent two cruisers to Cuban territorial waters, but stated that this action did not imply any intention of interfering or intervening in Cuba's internal affairs.</p>
<p>We decided that there was no need to give President Caspedes formal recognition, because the change of government was achieved through constitutional procedures. Welles was working hard and maintaining contact with various parties. On August 12, the State Department sent a telegram to Welles in the name of the President and myself, expressing our warm congratulations and "expressing appreciation for your work."</p>
<p>I often talked with the ambassadors of important Latin American countries about the Cuban issue. This was in line with the principle I had decided on, that is, whenever we needed to take diplomatic action toward Latin America, no matter what its nature, we must first consult with our relevant southern countries. We did not want to take unilateral action.</p>
<p>The situation was rapidly moving towards a climax, the disturbance in the Cuban army expanded, and the rebellion became increasingly urgent. The army mutinied under the leadership of Batista, and the Caspedes government finally collapsed. It was at that time (September 7) that I received a very long telegram from Ambassador Welles, suggesting that a considerable number of American troops be landed in Havana, and that a smaller number of troops be landed in other cities in Cuba.</p>
<p>He said in the telegram: "The method I propose will be a very limited intervention, of the following nature: the Caspedes government should be allowed to freely exercise its functions, just as it had before it was overthrown, with the full ability to control every department of the government. Of course, in the case where the majority of the army has mutinied, it is impossible for it to maintain its power in any satisfactory form. This point is very clear. If the situation is to change, unless the U.S. government is willing to assist it in maintaining public order, until the Cuban government has sufficient time... to organize a new army, if the "Caspedes government" so requests. To implement such a policy, it is necessary to land a considerable number of troops in Havana and a smaller number of troops in several more important ports in the Republic."</p>
<p>Ambassador Welles also said: "In my opinion, the shortcoming of this policy lies entirely in the fact that we will incur the very hostile opposition of the extremists and communists in Cuba... but in my opinion, I also feel that the detailed situation here has been fully explained to the representatives of various Latin American countries, and the landing of troops in Cuba is very obviously within the scope of the "Good Neighbor" policy. This policy has been expressed as much as possible in our relations with the Cuban people in the past five months."</p>
<p>After carefully reading and digesting this telegram, I personally took it to the White House to see the President and asked him to read it. After that, I firmly expressed my opinion to him, explaining that we could not and should not think of intervening in the Cuban situation, even to a limited extent. In my opinion, Welles was too influenced by the local situation and failed to consider the serious repercussions that would be caused throughout Latin America if we acceded to his request. Based on my previous conversations with the President, I knew that his determination not to intervene in the Cuban situation was as firm as mine. Mr. Roosevelt quickly agreed with my point of view. He said that he would only send a cruiser to Cuban territorial waters, where we already had several small squadrons stationed. Unless it was to evacuate American citizens caught in the conflict between Cuban political parties, naval vessels were strictly forbidden to send troops ashore.</p>
<p>After my meeting with the President, I returned to the hotel to draft a reply to Welles, which was already close to evening. Once the draft was completed, I went to the White House again. The President and I quickly agreed on the draft telegram. So I went to the State Department, and at eight o'clock in the evening, we sent the reply we had agreed on, which read as follows:</p>
<p>"We fully appreciate the points you have listed in the telegram. However, after careful consideration, the President has decided to send you the following telegram: "We are keenly aware that any promise, whether implicit or explicit, that involves the United States taking action in any situation, would be considered as undermining neutrality, favoring one party among many, and attempting to establish a government that, in the eyes of the world, especially Latin America, is a product of the U.S. government." The President's conversations with the representatives of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have gained widespread approval in the United States and throughout Latin America. Any action that is contrary to the established policy will result in serious consequences.</p>
<p>"The above, of course, does not mean that you should prevent, let alone influence the dynamics of any faction; in other words, strict neutrality is essential." After the collapse of the Caspedes government, Dr. Grau San Martin became president. We temporarily delayed recognizing his government, to see if it could establish order. The war between the parties continued. It was in this situation that I took a boat to attend the Montevideo Conference, and two weeks after I set off, the President issued a statement indicating that our government was willing to reconsider the 1903 treaty, which gave us the legal right to military intervention in the Cuban situation. Therefore, at the opening of the Montevideo Conference, our attitude of non-interference was made clear to the world.</p>
<p>Throughout this year, Cuba was at the core of our country's new active policy toward Latin America. Our actions toward Cuba could prove to other Latin American countries whether our declarations of non-interference were sincere. On my way back to Washington (from Montevideo), the Martin government in Cuba had disappeared, and Colonel Carlos Mendieta, the leader of the Nationalist Party, had become president. The conversation I had with Ambassador Caffery in Key West was to discuss the issue of recognizing Mendieta.</p>
<p>After the conversation was over, I called Washington to explain to the President that I supported Ambassador Caffery's view that Mendieta should be recognized. On the same day, I received a telegram from the Acting Secretary of State, Philip, which stated that the President would invite the representatives of the Latin American countries in Washington to meet with him at the White House next Tuesday or Wednesday. The President will tell them that the preconditions we had stipulated for recognizing the Cuban government had been met, because Mendieta had obtained the political support of the people, and with the help of the Cuban armed forces, the government clearly had the ability to maintain public order.</p>
<p>Now, the State Department is busy preparing a new treaty to replace the 1903 treaty. Negotiations began on May 29, 1934, and I, along with Assistant Secretary of State Welles and Cuban Ambassador Sterling, signed the new treaty. Welles earnestly requested me to allow him the privilege of signing it with me, although this approach was not customary. But since he had participated in a large part of the negotiations, I agreed.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt submitted the treaty to the Senate on the same day. In a short span of two days, the Senate voted in favor. The instruments of ratification were exchanged on December 9, and the Cuban people declared a three-day holiday to celebrate this event.</p>

<h3>Dance Industry's Opposition to Dance Ban Triggers Major Riot; Wrecks Social Affairs Bureau and Injures Officials and Police; Over Four Hundred Dancers and Employees Detained for Interrogation Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Over two thousand dancers and employees from 28 dance halls in this city, yesterday, in opposition to the lottery-based ban on dance venues, collectively stormed the Social Affairs Bureau, largely wrecking each office. Doors, windows, tables and chairs were almost entirely destroyed, and even a large number of important files and documents were ransacked, scattered all over the floor. At the time, the Labor-Management Arbitration Council was holding a meeting on the second floor, with Chairman Pan also present, nearly facing encirclement. As there were too few police officers on the scene at the time, they were unable to stop the riot, with many being injured. After 42 minutes of chaos, a large number of police officers finally arrived to suppress and stop the riot. The severity of the destruction was akin to a post-war battlefield. During and after the disturbance, as many as 43 officials and police officers were injured, and traffic on Xiafei Road and Songshan Road was also cut off for six to seven hours. The Social Affairs Bureau's lottery for banning dances, originally scheduled for 3:00 PM yesterday, was moved forward to 11:00 AM due to a conflict with the Labor-Management Arbitration Council meeting. When the dancers and employees learned of this news at a meeting at New Celestial Forest in the afternoon, their emotions were stirred. In a state of extreme emotional impulse, they rushed straight to the Social Affairs Bureau, enacting this unfortunate event. Afterwards, a large number of police officers arrived to surround and search for the rioting dancers and employees, detaining over four hundred people. The situation was chaotic, with many dancers injured from being squeezed and trampled. It was not until the entire search was completed that it was already 11:00 PM. Last night, all dance halls in the city were closed due to this incident, a rare occurrence since the establishment of dance halls in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, Mayor Wu was extremely angered and immediately convened Commander Xuan to report the incident to the central authorities, stating that the perpetrators would be severely punished according to the law. Police Chief Yu also made a similar statement; Commander Xuan has ordered a thorough investigation into those responsible for the wrecking of the Social Affairs Bureau and has ordered the arrest of the executive directors of the Dance Hall Business Association. The more than four hundred people who have been detained will begin to be interrogated today.</p>
<h3>New Celestial Forest Assembly: Bad News Spreads, Emotions Tense</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM, several thousand managers, employees, and dancers from 28 dance halls in the city convened a third temporary meeting at New Celestial Forest. The New Celestial Forest was packed with people, banners were raised high, and various anti-dance ban slogans were pasted on the walls. As the meeting began, news came that the Social Affairs Bureau had already moved the lottery forward to the morning, eliminating fourteen dance halls, including the first-class venues such as Celestial Music, Paramount, MGM, and Lido. At this time, the atmosphere at the meeting became tense, with dancers and employees relaying the news to each other, their expressions extremely agitated. Sun Hongyuan, the chairman of the Dance Industry Association, then reported this matter at the microphone, arguing that the Social Affairs Bureau's early lottery without prior notice was unreasonable, and stating that the constitution stipulates that people have the right to freely choose their profession. The government's claims that dance halls hinder thrift and harm social morals are not justified, therefore, the dance industry colleagues are determined to argue on the basis of reason and demand that the government withdraw its order. As Sun Hongyuan finished speaking, someone in the crowd of employees shouted "Oppose the lottery!" The entire venue responded, and a chorus of "Oppose the lottery" resounded for about a minute before subsiding.</p>
<h3>Shouting Willingness to Shed Blood</h3>
<p>Speakers who followed included dance representative Sun Zhimin, executive director of the workers' union Hu Yunyuan, workers' representative Wang Liansheng, and dancers Chen Xueli, Jin Meihong, and several others. Their words were very激烈的激烈的, and the emotions of the crowd became even more high-strung, with shouts rising and falling in the venue. Sun Zhimin said: Today is a matter of life and death. The Social Affairs Bureau's early lottery is too excessive. Everyone must unite and reason with the Social Affairs Bureau. If there is a lottery, we want to see it drawn, otherwise there will be fraud. Why are commercial dance halls banned while party dances are not? We must unite and oppose this, and share life and death together. Hu Yunyuan, director of the Workers' Union, had an even more intense attitude, and his words attacked Director Wu Kaixian. At that time, some workers in the crowd shouted "Oppose Wu Kaixian! Oppose Director Wu!" and "Go to the Social Affairs Bureau, willing to shed blood," etc. After the Master of Ceremonies repeatedly shouted "Calm down! Calm down" into the microphone, it temporarily subsided. Afterwards, dancer Chen Xueli automatically took the stage to speak, with tears in her eyes, she said: "My family of eight, how will we live in the future! This is the government forcing us to sell our souls, forcing us to become prostitutes." Jin Meihong also said: "The government is forcing us onto the path of death, we are unwilling to be prostitutes." A chorus of shouts then arose among the dancers.</p>
<p>In the midst of the meeting's emotionally charged atmosphere, Zheng Weixian, director of MGM, was relatively calm. Zheng told the crowd at the microphone: This matter has been entrusted to a lawyer to file an administrative appeal with Nanjing, and we will strive for it according to the law. I hope everyone can be more rational. However, the emotions of the crowd were obviously not calmed by this.</p>
<h3>Dividing into Small Groups to Go Straight to the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>After this, Wu Jichun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stood up to speak, expressing his sympathy, and said that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce did not send anyone to participate in this morning's lottery. Lu Huimin and Zhang Hongwei, two members of women's groups, were also present, but did not speak. At this time, it was nearly 3:00 PM, and the crowd was already impatient. From the crowd, a shout of "Go to the Social Affairs Bureau" and "Time is money" rose up, echoing throughout the venue. Just as they were about to disperse after shouting slogans, Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the General Labor Union, arrived. Mr. Shui first expressed his sympathy, then said: He had spoken with Director Wu in the morning, and Director Wu had no choice but to do so under the orders of the central authorities, and had his own difficulties. Regarding the livelihood issues of women and workers, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to open dance retraining courses for dancers, and give severance pay to workers, the funds for which will be raised by adding relief funds to the dance hall tea fees. Finally, he advised the crowd not to act emotionally, but to remain rational and strive for it within the bounds of the law, and that the labor union would definitely support them. Unexpectedly, as Mr. Shui finished speaking, someone in the crowd of workers shouted "Please Mr. Shui Xiangyun to lead us to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition," although Mr. Shui later broke free, the crowd of dancers and employees surged out of the New Celestial Forest gate, dividing into small groups, either on foot or by truck, successively gathering in the Social Affairs Bureau plaza.</p>
<h3>Beginning to Use Force: The Flying Fortress is Difficult to Block the Tide of People, Fourteen Police Officers are the First to Be Beaten</h3>
<p>The first group arrived at 3:30 PM, followed by successive arrivals, until around 4:00 PM, when over two thousand dancers, employees, and musicians from the 28 dance halls had arrived, standing in rows facing north. Sun Hongyuan, chairman of the Dance Hall Business Association, and Zhu Yongming, secretary-general, were also present. The Social Affairs Bureau plaza was filled with banners and a sea of people.</p>
<p>At the time, the sixteenth meeting of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee was being held in the bureau chief's conference room on the second floor, discussing important cases such as year-end bonuses for professional workers. Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xu Jiguang, Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei, Executive Director of the Industrial Association Hu Boxiang, Secretary-General of the General Labor Union Liang Yongzhang, and others all personally attended. Chief Wu Kaixian, who also served as a committee member, attended the entire meeting. Yuan Wenzhang, director of the Fourth Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Chen Su, chief of the Tenth Section, were waiting in their offices for representatives of the dancers and employees to come and state their case. At this time, the crowd gathered in the plaza was noisy. At 4:05 PM, a shout of "We want to eat" was first issued from the crowd, rising and responding, gradually expanding. Then the crowd moved forward, gradually approaching the steps. The fourteen police officers of the Police Bureau Flying Fortress who were maintaining order on the scene tried their best to dissuade them, but the crowd swarmed forward. Some dancers and employees used the bamboo poles of their flags to violently strike the police officers' faces from all directions. A small number of police officers were unable to stop the crowd of people coming like a tide, and were pushed up the steps in one go, going straight up to the second floor via the left and right escalators, breaking into the deputy director's office, the conference room, and the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee office on the third floor, wrecking all the glass doors and windows, lights, telephones, documents, tables, chairs, and miscellaneous items in the room. They also threw broken chair legs, wooden boards, and documents out of the windows into the plaza, throwing the telephone wires and documents randomly on the ground, ignoring everyone's persuasion. Their scolding and exclamations were ferocious and unparalleled.</p>
<h3>The Swallows Screamed in Anger, Ferocious Beyond Compare</h3>
<p>At this time, the dancers changed their usual gentle and approachable demeanor, rolled up their sleeves, shouted and yelled, revealing their ferocity. Instantly, paper scraps and glass shards flew everywhere, and the bureau chief's office was destroyed in an instant. Even the sofa covers were torn, and nothing, big or small, was intact, only the oil painting and bust statue of Chairman Chiang, placed on the east and west sides, still stood motionless. The wall clock in the bureau chief's residence was also smashed, with the hour hand pointing at 4:34.</p>
<h3>Chairman Pan and Others Nearly Involved</h3>
<p>At this time, Chairman Pan was in the secretary's office of the Social Affairs Bureau, intending to inform Commander Xuan of the situation by telephone. A dancer saw this, rushed forward, and pressed down on the telephone to stop him. Another dancer, while crying and making a fuss, took the inkstone on the table, smashed the glass on the desk, and threw a teacup at the desk lamp. Chairman Pan, who was standing by, narrowly escaped being hit. Deputy Chairman Xu's face was splashed with water due to the breaking of a water jug.</p>
<p>At the same time, the plaza was also in chaos, with a group of employees rushing into the offices of the first division of the Social Affairs Bureau from another staircase, using bamboo poles to break the glass of each window and the lights, and wrecking various items. Office chairs and tables were thrown into the plaza, and then dismantled one by one by others. The Fourth Section of the First Division was the Grain Section. When the crowd rushed in, Section Chief Ji Mingzhai shouted, "This is the place where your food is handled," but the crowd replied, "Everyone has no food to eat, we don't care, hit them!" Niu Zezi, from the number two truck company, squeezed out of the crowd to call the general office from the third division chief's office. He was chased and beaten by the crowd, but was saved by a member of the Land Administration Bureau and locked in a garage, thus escaping safely. Lu, the squad leader of the Third Squadron of the Motor Vehicle Brigade, and several team members were also injured by bamboo poles and wooden blocks in the chaos. They were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The plaza was full of broken tables, broken chairs, torn paper, documents, bamboo poles, slogans, broken glass, and other items. Some of the cars parked in the plaza were also affected, with the window glass broken by bamboo poles and large sticks.</p>
<h3>Mass Brawl Unfolds in the Plaza; Dozens Injured on Both Sides</h3>
<p>Police Branch Chief Injured; Three Pistols Snatched</p>
<p>When the mob began to vandalize, the Songshan Police Branch had already received the news and dispatched more than twenty police officers to assist in maintaining order. Unexpectedly, the mob changed its target and, wielding wooden sticks, rushed towards them. The police officers defended themselves with their bare hands, but eventually retreated. At that moment, the second batch of reinforcement police officers from the Songshan Branch arrived and re-entered the scene together. However, due to the chaotic order, the police officers were forced to enter and exit three times, still unable to quell the situation. At this time, Song Tingjun, the chief of the Songshan Police Branch, along with Section Chief Rong Yongshao, happened to enter from the main entrance on Linsen Road to investigate. They encountered a group of the mob, and in the midst of flying sticks, both suffered severe head and facial injuries. Seeing that the situation was beyond control, the Flying Fortress squad reported to the headquarters via radio. Director Yu urgently dispatched all criminal police and the remaining Flying Fortress squad members to the Social Affairs Bureau, using steel shields as cover, and charged in. A mass brawl then broke out in the plaza, with scraps of paper and wooden blocks flying everywhere. As the stalemate continued, thirty to forty police officers were injured and fell to the ground. Dozens of dancers and staff were also knocked down and trampled, all of whom were rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Due to their numerical advantage, the dancers and staff fought even harder. Three police officers had their guns snatched away, but by evening, all three missing guns had been recovered. At that time, security police stationed at the North Station were ordered to come to reinforce and arrived at 4:40 PM. The entire force was divided into two groups, checking the identity cards, dancer licenses, dance association membership cards, and whether there was mud or blood stains on their hands to determine if they had participated in the vandalism. Those found to be suspicious or of unknown identity were immediately detained. After the detention, the staff members of the Social Affairs Bureau on site identified them one by one. The inspection lasted until 11:00 PM, and a total of more than four hundred men and women were detained and sent to various police branches for detention. A thorough interrogation was scheduled to begin this morning.</p>
<p>Dancers Weep and Claim They Were Forced</p>
<p>During the inspection, many dancers cried out in distress, claiming that they had been forced to come, as the organization had announced that those who did not participate would be fined 3 million yuan. Accountants, drivers, waiters, and even shoeshiners from various dance halls were also found during the inspection, and it was rumored that they were mostly forced to participate. Finally, Jin Baolong, an inspector from the Vienna Dance Hall, and Wang Zhenda, a sofa merchant who specializes in dance halls, were found in the ranks with pistols hidden on them. They were arrested for carrying weapons and participating in the vandalism.</p>
<p>Sun Zhimin and Meng Yan, representatives of the Dancers' Association, were also summoned for questioning last night. They denied participating in the vandalism. The police bureau stated that the facts were still under investigation and ordered them to be temporarily detained for questioning.</p>
<p>Top Officials Discuss Countermeasures; Sun Hongyuan Hands Over a List of Leaders from Both Associations; Commander Xuan Emphasizes Strict Handling</p>
<p>After the conflict ended, Commander Xuan arrived at the scene and immediately met with Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Wu, and Director Zhu in the conference room of the Land Administration Bureau to discuss countermeasures. Chen Baotai and Zhu Xubai were also present. At 6:10 PM, police officers brought Sun Hongyuan, the chairman of the Dance Industry Association. Director Wu Kaixian questioned him: Why was the bureau not notified for approval before holding the general meeting? Sun replied that everything was decided by the presidium of the association, and the capitalists believed that it did not matter whether the dance halls were open or not. Commander Xuan then pointed out that the police bureau received the record filing letter when the general meeting had already started, so the meeting was held before the record was filed. Regarding the petition to the Social Affairs Bureau, Sun Hongyuan said it was at the request of the labor representatives. Director Wu Kaixian asked who proposed the petition in the general meeting, but Sun could not answer. Commander Xuan said that the dance industry was deceiving the police bureau in this matter. They reported to the police bureau that after the general meeting, they were prepared to go home and not parade or petition, but the result was that they went to the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu said with emotion: "I have always considered the difficulties of the dance industry. Someone in the central government is close to me and is 'condoning evil.' The ban on dancing was decided last September, but it has been delayed until now, so that the dance halls can have a chance to make money. But the dance industry repays me by destroying the Social Affairs Bureau! Recently, in the municipal meeting, I even suggested that half of the dance halls should be banned by lottery, but the dancers should not stop working by half, in order to maintain their livelihoods." The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM and decided to instruct Sun Hongyuan to hand over a list of all the responsible persons of the Dance Industry Council and the Dance Industry Workers' Union for interrogation. Commander Xuan also strongly emphasized that this matter must be handled strictly, "otherwise, the local authorities will never be able to implement the central government's orders. Students can insult local administrative officials, and dancers can destroy government agencies. This is not constitutional rule, but an insurrection. In the past two or three days, the international impression of our country has been extremely bad." At this time, the search work had begun on the plaza, and the meeting was adjourned. Except for Director Wu, the attendees left the Social Affairs Bureau one after another. The security was tight at that time, and when Speaker Pan left the scene, he first stated his identity, and then the police officer used a radio transmitter to ask for instructions before releasing him.</p>
<p>Prosecutors Arrive for Inspection</p>
<p>After the dancers destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Wu immediately called Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office. Chief Prosecutor Huang immediately dispatched all prosecutors to the scene to investigate. Mr. Quan, the prosecutor, arrived at the Social Affairs Bureau at 5:00 PM, inspected the interior for a week, and collected various material evidence. He left the Social Affairs Bureau at 7:00 PM and reported the situation to Chief Huang for future reference in investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Tense Scene at the North Station; Student Groups Return to Shanghai for the New Year; Alarming a Large Number of Military Police on Alert</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the student unrest at Tongji University occurred, the authorities paid close attention to student movements. Yesterday, it was suddenly reported that hundreds of students from Jinling University in Nanjing were coming to Shanghai on the fifth train to comfort the students of Tongji University and others. The authorities immediately dispatched a large number of military police to the station for protection. Yu Shuping, director of the police bureau, Wang Zhaohuai, director of the police affairs department of the railway bureau, Ouyang Zunquan, director of the general affairs department of the municipal government, Ju or Wen, deputy director of the training council of the Ministry of Education, and Lu Dagong, section chief of the police bureau's security section, all rushed to the North Station in time. The railway bureau prepared three large buses for the students of Jinling University to ride in. At 4:00 PM, the train entered the station, and the atmosphere at the station suddenly became tense. The students on the train craned their necks to see the situation and were all surprised. The railway police department immediately sent personnel to find student representatives. According to the students, they were 380 students from Shanghai from the two campuses of Jinling University, male and female, who were collectively returning to their hometowns for winter vacation, and were led by Training Director Wei Zhongchao. Mr. Wei immediately assured Director Yu and Deputy Director Zhou that they were indeed students returning home and had no other actions. All the students were invited by the railway bureau to take the large buses and were sent home separately. The students were extremely happy to receive this unexpected preferential treatment, and the military police at the station were withdrawn.</p>
<p>Director Wu Speaks; Director Wu told reporters afterwards: "This handling of the ban on dancing has been extremely cautious beforehand. The method of phasing out the ban was approved by the municipal government meeting and filed with the Executive Yuan. All parties believe that these methods take both sides into account and are quite satisfactory. Yesterday, the rioters did not present their reasons through proper channels of request, but resorted to gathering mobs and publicly destroying administrative agencies, and dared to assault guards, disregarding the law. It is obvious that this is an organized action by bandits. In addition to actively reorganizing and continuing to work as usual, the municipal government and the garrison headquarters will strictly investigate to maintain order and enforce the law. The ban on dancing will be strictly enforced in accordance with the approved methods, without hesitation." Yuan Wenzhang, director of the fourth department of the Social Affairs Bureau, also expressed the following opinions from his position: "The essence of this matter is a public security issue, so the police bureau is responsible for handling it. The chairman of the Dance Industry Association and the chairman of the Dance Hall Workers' Union were both searched in the kitchen of the Social Affairs Bureau and were detained by the police bureau. As for whether there are suspects who instigated the crime, they are being interrogated. The Social Affairs Bureau did not demand compensation from the dance industry for the losses suffered yesterday. As for whether the dance halls will be open today, we have asked the mayor for instructions. The ban on dancing is still being phased out, and there is no basis for the rumor that it will be changed to a one-time ban. The Social Affairs Bureau also has no such proposal."</p>
<p>President Zhang's Instructions; The central government has also received reports on this incident. Since Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan jointly sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan President Zhang at 5:40, President Zhang was furious upon receiving the report and immediately instructed on the phone that the ringleaders must be given the most severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Working Overtime to Organize Files; Everything Expected to Return to Normal Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Although today is Sunday, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to work overtime to organize files. It is expected that everything will return to normal from tomorrow. Yesterday, when the bureau was vandalized, the file storage room on the third floor was blocked with rice by employees after hearing the alarm, so the bureau's files, except for those already submitted by various departments, were fortunately spared. However, the industrial and commercial registration cards of the first department and the grain merchant registration cards of the fourth department were all robbed and scattered. If there are no copies, it will take a lot of time to organize. The bureau's archives were also not robbed yesterday because the employees turned off the lights in the warehouse when the crowd rushed in. The crowd did not identify them in a hurry, so they were spared. In addition, the office of the fourth department of the Social Affairs Bureau was preserved due to the wit of a few staff members who temporarily wrote the words "Land Administration Bureau" on the door wall with white chalk. The destroyed offices of the bureau included the director's office, the deputy director's office, the director's conference room, the secretary's office, the conference room, the general affairs section, the copying room, the labor-management arbitration committee, the director's office of the first department, the price management section, the food section, and the industrial and commercial registration section. The agricultural, forestry, fishing, and cooperative section and the statistics room of the first department were spared because they were located in a remote corner and were not noticed. The total loss is impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>Director Wu Escapes Danger</p>
<p>At that time, the door of the director's conference room was locked, and the labor-management evaluation meeting was temporarily suspended. The crowd swarmed in and smashed the glass door of the aisle. Two dancers even used wooden sticks to smash the main door of the director's conference room. Chen Ziyun, the bodyguard of Speaker Pan who was standing in front of the door, stated that he was an employee of the Senate, but the back of his head was still hit hard by a dancer with a broken chair leg. After the door was broken, the crowd entered the director's conference room. At that time, Director Wu had been guided by a staff member to retreat through a small door to the Land Administration Bureau. Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and Zhao, the consultant of the Social Affairs Bureau, persuaded the dancers and staff not to act so recklessly. If they had any complaints, they could push representatives to state them in person. However, the participants in the vandalism acted arrogantly. A part of the dancers cried and screamed, shouting "We want to eat, you don't give us food," and held broken chair legs or wooden sticks in one hand. When they saw glass, lights, and other objects, they smashed them even harder. All the objects in the room were also destroyed. The police officers of the 11th group of the Flying Fortress squad rushed in with bayonets, and the crowd retreated slightly. Later, the 23rd batch of security police heard the news and rushed to the scene. Lu Dagong, the section chief of the police bureau's security section, ordered the bayonets to be taken down and held hands with each other, forcing the crowd to retreat to the two corners of the square, with the dancers in the south and the staff in the north, surrounded by a group of people. Seeing that the situation was no match, the crowd began to throw away the wooden sticks, and the atmosphere immediately eased. A conflict that lasted a total of 42 minutes ended here.</p>
<h3>Checking and Detaining Suspects in Batches</h3>
<p>After 6:00 PM, the police officers divided the crowd at the scene into dancers and staff. The directors immediately reprimanded them, saying that the Social Affairs Bureau was doing its best to solve the difficulties of the dance industry, but today the dancers came to attack the Social Affairs Bureau, and the chairman of the association should be held responsible. Speaker Pan's attitude was also quite激動, saying that the Senate had sympathized with the difficulties of the dance industry in the past. If the dance halls had legitimate reasons today, they could take the proper route and have the Senate convey them to the local authorities. Today's actions were completely violent, and they should know that the Communist Party has a whole plan for Shanghai, and the dance industry has been used by them. Sun Hongyuan also knew that the situation was serious at this time, shaking his head, but his attitude was still calm and constantly defended himself. Director Wu</p>

<h3>Xinjiang Problems: Thirty Years of Shadows and Future Prospects</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ma Cibo</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Dihua, January 24th] The evolution of Xinjiang's politics, leaving aside the distant past, only focusing on the thirty-odd years from the establishment of the Republic of China to the Yining Incident, Xinjiang never lifted her veil, seemingly maintaining her mysteriousness as an Asian virgin land. Apart from a few internationally renowned archaeologists who conducted exploratory excavations, the Chinese people have always been unclear about this own land and millions of their own compatriots. Yang Zengxin's seventeen years of non-interference, with a focus on frugality and clarity in governance, can be considered a prosperous era. The common people still remember him fondly to this day, but he only acknowledged the temple and not the god in relation to the central government, obeying control but not transfers. Although nominally a province of China, the actual administrative power had its own style, operating independently. Jin Shuren generally continued Yang Zengxin's legacy, but his talent was inferior to Yang Zengxin's. Although the situation of being close to and distant from the central government remained the same, internal corruption led to ethnic conflicts and social unrest, thus opening the source of chaos in Xinjiang. The people suffered greatly. This was a case of heroes emerging in times of trouble. Under the weakness of Jin Shuren's regime, two adventurers, Sheng Shicai and Ma Zhongying, emerged due to opportune circumstances. Xinjiang's final situation became a battleground for Sheng and Ma's struggle for dominance. Their tug-of-war for hegemony lasted for half a year, showcasing some spectacular performances. Although Ma Zhongying was brave and good at fighting, once creating the masterpiece of besieging Urumqi, he was ultimately no match for Sheng Shicai, who had studied in Japan and traveled the Trans-Siberian Railway and had international vision. Sheng Shicai used foreign aid to defeat him. When Ma retreated to Kashgar, he still held half of southern Xinjiang, showing a trend of splitting the territory equally with Sheng Shicai. However, in the end, because he did not understand the game of "politics," he fell into a trap and walked into a snare himself. In a certain month of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), Ma Zhongying, with a chivalrous spirit akin to a Chinese forest hero, entered Moscow and has not been heard from since. He abandoned a group of partners in adversity, who awaited his return every day, conjuring up many rumors, but he has permanently become a mythical figure.</p>
<p>Sheng Shicai's Rule: Mysterious, Terrifying, and Unpredictable</p>
<p>After Sheng Shicai took power in Xinjiang, seeing through the weaknesses of the era, he simply acknowledged the thief as his father, making Xinjiang not only mysterious but also terrifying. He vigorously promoted his grand policies, and in his legal code, the word "motherland" could no longer be found; he was the leader of the Xinjiang people. The international fortifications at Xingxingxia had their gun barrels pointed eastward, and foreign troops were stationed in Hami. Han Chinese should not ask who owns the land west of Yangguan Pass. Everyone found the Xinjiang problem even more unfathomable and could only sigh in vain.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, things often turned out unexpectedly. When the flames of the Pacific War were raging fiercely and the battle for Leningrad was in full swing, Sheng Shicai suddenly made a 180-degree turn, returning the entire territory of Xinjiang to the nation in its entirety. It can be said that Sheng Shicai's ten years of rule in Xinjiang were filled with evil deeds, but one good deed was enough to offset a hundred evils. He ultimately did not allow the territory to change color. He became a Xinjiang warlord and also knew how to trim his sails to the wind, which proves he was not ignorant of current affairs. Since Mr. Sheng generously withdrew from Xinjiang, flying to Chongqing to take up the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and leaving his throne, the mysterious veil of Xinjiang was lifted, and the people of the whole country could breathe in some fresh air about Xinjiang. However, the political situation and customs of Xinjiang and the interior had been completely isolated for more than thirty years, and the general knowledge of Xinjiang among the Chinese people was indeed too shallow. At the time, we failed to recognize the significance of Xinjiang's return to the motherland as equivalent to shedding its skin and changing its nationality, considering it an important interlude in World War II. Therefore, when the Yining Incident occurred, everyone initially underestimated it. Furthermore, the enemy's propaganda, cloaked in political and ethnic garments, was truly dazzling and misleading. In fact, the content of the incident was very simple. It can be said that without Sheng Shicai's change of heart, there would have been no Yining Incident. The Yining Incident was an inevitable reaction after Xinjiang's return to the motherland. Therefore, we do not need to delve into the causes of the rebellion, nor do we need to conduct a detailed study of the historical relationships, political connections, and nationality issues of the key figures leading the rebellion. Instead, we must recognize that the Yining Incident was a "international debt" left behind by Sheng Shicai. Therefore, the evolution of the political situation in Xinjiang that we have seen in the year since the peace agreement has been nothing more than haggling over this "international debt." The responsibility for the Yining Incident cannot be entirely attributed to the authorities in power at the time. At most, it can only be said that they were unclear about the situation and did not take adequate precautions. As for the inevitable occurrence of the rebellion, it was directed by an international conspiracy. Therefore, today, if we want to understand the crux of the Xinjiang problem, we only need to analyze the rise and fall of a specific political ambition in Xinjiang after the peace negotiations, and we can understand its general outline. To solve it, they demand pro-Soviet, democratic groups, and the standards of unity will have unlimited development and transformation. General Zhang Zhizhong, in order to achieve genuine peace in Xinjiang, took on a heavy burden with a spirit of great courage and resolute style, and agreed to all the harsh conditions put forward by the Yining side. General Zhang only made one request to them, which was for the people of Yining to support the nation. Regardless of pro-Soviet, democratic, peaceful unity, they must all be implemented within the unified national administrative framework. Speaking of being pro-Soviet, China and the Soviet Union fundamentally have a friendly agreement, which the whole country can implement. Xinjiang certainly cannot be an exception and cannot have separate pro-Soviet clauses. Democracy is the trend of the times, and Xinjiang should naturally catch up. Xinjiang is the most ethnically diverse place, and without unity, there can be no talk of peace. Xinjiang borders the Soviet Union for thousands of miles, and without being pro-Soviet, there can be no talk of peace. Xinjiang is the territory of the Republic of China, and if it wants to secede from the nation and become a separate entity, there can certainly be no talk of peace. Without peace, there can be no construction. Without construction, there can be no progress. This is a self-evident truth. General Zhang used this reasoning to persuade them, but the Yining side always felt aversion to the concept of "nation," believing that it was a Han Chinese thing and had nothing to do with them. Therefore, the many difficulties encountered in the peace negotiations were mostly focused on the two words "unity."</p>
<p>After the peace agreement was signed, General Zhang said to the people: "Now they want everything, only not the nation. If they want anything, I will give it to them. One day, they will want nothing but the nation. Recognizing the nation is their final destination." Indeed, without this magnanimous spirit, one would not be qualified to solve the Xinjiang problem.</p>
<p>During the first celebration party for the success of the peace negotiations, General Zhang first raised his glass to thank Mr. Savelyev, the Soviet Consul General who mediated the negotiations. He said, "Without Consul General Savelyev's reconciliation, peace in Xinjiang would not have been achieved." His smiling face contained boundless bitterness. He swallowed the blood from his broken teeth and drank the toast of gratitude. Only he knew the truth about the rise and fall of the nation. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Conscription Work Progressing Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nantong, January 28th] The first phase of conscription in this county, after reducing the quota, has been decided to be completed by the end of this month simultaneously with the emergency conscription quota. The second phase of conscription will begin in August. Currently, the conscription work is underway in various districts. The lottery ceremony for the first district has been held, and a small number of conscripted recruits from some rural areas have been sent to the county government. The progress in various districts is very smooth and can be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Zhenjiang, January 31st] The central government attaches great importance to the emergency conscription in this province.

<h3>Nantong Abolishes New Year's Gift-Giving</h3>

<h3>Opening the Door to Peace: Concentrated on Three Focuses</h3>
<p>The Yining small court, with an international background, political ambitions, and arrogance, attempted to implement its treacherous plans and demanded harsh conditions, making the difficulties and twists and turns encountered in the peace negotiations unimaginable to outsiders. At that time, General Zhang Zhizhong, the representative of the central government, with the purest sincerity and the greatest patience, had dozens of discussions with the four representatives of the Yining rebel people, experiencing several breakdowns and several resumptions. The most serious one lasted for more than a month without any negotiations. Everyone was worried that the somber atmosphere would be difficult to break. However, General Zhang still had extraordinary political cultivation. He never changed his attitude and continued to use his patience and sincerity to influence the other party, finally enabling the peace agreement to be signed on June 6th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946). During the negotiations, it can be said that everything was discussed, and all hypocritical facades were torn away. The problems were concentrated on three focuses: diplomacy, ethnicity, and politics. General Zhang Zhizhong had already developed a clear plan for solving these problems. Shortly after entering Xinjiang on May 7th, he published a proclamation on building a new Xinjiang based on the Three Principles of the People, putting forward the four slogans of democracy, peace, unity, and unification. The solution to the problem ultimately did not exceed the scope set by General Zhang. From the peace agreement to the policy program, the entire content was nothing more than advocating pro-Soviet relations in diplomacy, implementing democracy in politics, practicing ethnic unity, and ensuring national unification. The common goal for everyone was to achieve peace, stability, and construction in Xinjiang. These are such grand and righteous political slogans. If there were no special intentions on the dark side, General Zhang Zhizhong's policy for governing Xinjiang would truly be a legitimate and reasonable political reform. However, the reality is not so simple. The Yining side believed that the signing of the peace agreement was the beginning of the problem, not the end of the problem.</p>

<h3>City Government Information Office Releases Account of Mayor's Assault</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the City Government Information Office's announcement yesterday, the truth about Mayor Wu being assaulted and injured on the 29th of last month while mediating a student strike at Tongji University is as follows:</p>
<p>When the crowd surrounded the Mayor, someone shouted, "Don't hit the Mayor!" But at this time, someone had already grabbed the Mayor's throat, one person was holding the Mayor's waist, and another person knocked off the Mayor's hat, smashed his glasses, and struck the Mayor's head on the left and right temples with two blows, dragging him to the ground. At this moment, someone shouted, "The police are hitting people!" The Mayor immediately said, "Let me get up and give the order, do not allow the police to open fire and shoot people!" Before he could finish speaking, someone shouted again, "Don't let him get up!" This voice was exactly the same as the voice saying "The police are hitting people," and it clearly came from the same person. This is evidenced by the handwritten confession of Feng Liwen, a student of the Tongji University Law School (Deputy Standing Director of the Student Self-Government Association of the school), after being detained: "When I came back to read Mr. Huang Boquan's written nameplate to my classmates, the crowd clashed with the police, and people scattered to both sides. I shouted loudly, 'Don't hit the Mayor!' I also fell to the ground at the same time. When I woke up from lying on the ground, I heard the words 'Don't let him get up.' Fearing being injured by stones and cavalry, after getting up, I immediately ran to the left. I didn't see who shouted 'Don't let him get up' and who hit the Mayor. I heard the Mayor say, 'Police, don't open fire' in the crowd." Further evidenced by the confession of Huang Lu, a student of the Tongji University Engineering School (one of the Presidium of the school's Beijing Petition), after being detained: "When the beating occurred, because the order was chaotic, the Mayor was beaten, which is a fact. But there were too many students from various schools, and I can't remember who did the beating. However, our Presidium often neglected our responsibility for protection. This is just my personal opinion, and I don't know if other Presidium members acknowledge this responsibility."</p>
<p>In addition, Cai Mingde, a student of the Tongji University Engineering School, also shouted in his confession, "I saw the Mayor being hit with two blows." Also, Xue Yukun, a student of the Engineering School, stated in his confession, "I am very happy that the Mayor came to help us solve the problem. There is no reason to hit the Mayor at all. Of course, it was the work of bandits, which can be investigated." This is sufficient proof that Mayor Wu was indeed assaulted by bandits.</p>

<h3>National Bank Agrees to Purchase 80,000 Bags of Flour to Stabilize Prices, Allotting it to Teachers and Staff of Private Schools in Exchange for Reducing Tuition Fees</h3>

<p>Oppose Destruction and Support Construction</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, President of Fudan University, gave a speech to the graduating students, encouraging them in three points: Replace destruction with construction: The meaning of life lies in leaving behind something of contribution or construction to human society, so that later generations will be encouraged. Therefore, all destructive actions must be opposed and construction supported! Replace selfishness with service: Helping others is the source of happiness. There is no one more miserable than a selfish person. The happiest life is complete selflessness, dedicating all one's energy to hard work and struggle. Replace struggle with cooperation: There are love and hate in people's hearts. Cooperation is the expression of love, and struggle is the expression of hate. It is easy for friction to occur between people. The biggest difficulties at present are "division," "hatred," and "struggle." If you want to strive for leadership, you can only gain the faith of others through serving and cooperating with others. Today's country and individuals have three evils to eliminate. We should emulate Zhou Chu in ancient times, eliminate defeatism through construction, eliminate selfishness through service, and eliminate division through cooperation. If everyone seeks self-improvement, the country will surely prosper.</p>
<p>Skills for Independence Are Not Limited to Further Education</p>
<p>Acting Director Li of the Education Bureau also made a speech, stating three points: After graduating from middle school, it is not necessary to go to university. Students should not feel disappointed and lose their ambition just because they cannot enter university. You must know that skills for independence are not necessarily obtained in university. Supplementary education can also be obtained in companies, factories, or stores. Youth's patriotic emotions should not be blamed, but patriotic methods should be constructive rather than destructive. It is a fact that some political facilities are currently not good, but they should be improved gradually within the scope of the constitution through legal means, and not through bloody destructive means that would lead to instability in the entire country and society. Acting Director Li wished all students success in their studies or careers after leaving school. After the speech, certificates and awards were given, and representatives from each school received them in turn. Finally, the graduate representative gave a response speech. After the ceremony, students from the Physical Education College performed sports.</p>

<p>Hualian Six Wins in Six Matches</p>
<p>Hualian is the champion of the Class A Division of the Second League, and has been dominating Shanghai for many years. No strong team, whether Chinese or foreign, has been able to shake its throne. In this division, it has won all six battles, and teams such as Shantou, Renyu, Chenyou, as well as foreign troops such as Toronto Bianca, the US Military Police, and the US Air Force, have all fallen victim to it. In the recent battle against the US Military Police, it scored 105 points, setting the highest scoring record for the Men's Basketball League, which is especially commendable.

<p>Dagong Five Wins and One Loss</p>
<p>Dagong was newly formed this year, bringing together the essence of the Philippine Islands Group and the Luoyang Zheng Lun two strong teams. The lineup is flexible and the tactics are novel. Since its debut, it has had five wins and one loss, and Toronto Bianca, ENBIAS, Qingbai, the US Military Police, and the US Air Force have all been defeated. However, the battle against Chenyou was relatively abnormal, and it unfortunately lost by half a point with a score of 50 to 51. But the future of the championship is still hopeful. Today's battle is of great importance. If it can defeat Hualian, then the points will be equal to Hualian's, and the championship can still be decided. Today's battle between the two heroes of the basketball world is expected to be wonderful and intense, and the battle will be like fire and tea.

<p>Visit Xue Zahan to Discuss Promoting Chinese Chess</p>
<p>Xie Xiasun, a famous Chinese chess player, recently came to Shanghai. On January 31st, he visited Xue Weihan, a chess player in Shanghai, at Xue's residence on Albert Road to discuss the problem of promoting Chinese chess. During the War of Resistance, Xie initiated a grand chess competition in Singapore, and all the income was donated to the government.

<h3>Winter World Games Open; Ice Skating Sets World Record; Ice Hockey Dispute Resolved, Not Included in Competition</h3>
<p>[United Press International, St. Moritz, 31st] According to unofficial announcements: American athlete Fitz Gerald broke the world record for the 500-meter ice skating event on the morning of the 31st. Fitz completed the course in 43.2 seconds, surpassing the world record by one-tenth of a second. [Associated Press, St. Moritz, 30th] The Fifth Winter World Games opened here today. The International World Games Committee announced tonight that ice hockey would not be included in the competition, a result of the unresolved dispute between the American team regarding twin brothers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, St. Moritz, Switzerland, 31st] Norwegian ice skater Helgesen won the 500-meter ice skating championship today, with a time of 43.4 seconds. [Agence France-Presse, Berne, Switzerland, 31st] The World Games Committee's decision yesterday to exclude ice hockey from the Fifth Winter World Games has been met with strong criticism in today's Swiss newspapers.</p>
<p>[United Press International, St. Moritz, Switzerland, 30th] The 1948 Winter World Games officially opened here on the 30th at the Aare Olympic Games. The twenty-eight participating nations marched in formation through the streets of St. Moritz on the morning of the 28th amidst ice and snow. The sun shone brightly under a clear blue sky, a rare occurrence in recent weeks, with the temperature at twelve degrees Celsius above zero. Thousands of athletes from various countries, dressed in neat uniforms, presented a magnificent spectacle due to their different national identities and appearances. The procession stretched for two miles, with many carrying sleds on their shoulders. The procession began at 9:15 AM Greenwich Mean Time, slightly delayed by forty-five minutes. Neither of the two American ice hockey teams participated in the procession, but the chairman of the American World Games Committee, Brown, and other senior officials led the American team, advancing steadily behind the Stars and Stripes. Twenty thousand sports fans lined the streets to watch, but the narrow streets were insufficient to accommodate them, creating a crowd more congested than at a major American football game. The few Swiss police maintaining order faced great difficulty. The scene was further enlivened by the presence of private cars, jeeps, shuttle buses, and horse-drawn sleds interspersed among the crowds, making for a dazzling spectacle. The list of players selected by the Football Committee to represent the city in the World Games football preliminaries has been announced. The team is scheduled to play a practice match against the West Union team at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM today to test their skills. Tickets are still available for 20,000 and 40,000 yuan. Sales will begin at 12:30 PM at the gymnasium. The lineups for the preliminary representatives and the West Union teams are announced as follows: Referee Wu Shouheng, Linesmen Zhang Le, Deng Xiaoliang.</p>
<p>World Games Preliminary Team: Li Yao. West Union Team: Zhang Banglun, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Han Longhai, Xia Tixian, Wen Nuogan, Ivanov. West Union Team: Xu Erz, Lisi Fort, Hannibo Nuogulov, F. Aiw, Hua, Zhen Funilao Bustov, Glénas.</p>
<p>Gao Baozheng Fei Chunhua, Mai Lu Xika Luole Qu.</p>
<p>The city's representative team has decided to depart for Hong Kong from Shanghai next weekend. As a warm-up, they will play a practice match against the West Union team today. The twelve star players of the team are all top-notch players from Shanghai, a blend of the best from the Donghua and Kenbai teams. Their excellent coordination and well-organized lineup are unmatched. Today's match is nothing less than a pre-expedition flag ceremony. With the team's strength, they will surely defeat the West Union team decisively. The wonderful performance at that time is naturally expected.</p>
<p>The West Union team consists of top players from the Jewish and German sports teams. The strength of their midfield line is comparable to that of the representative team. Mai Lu Xi's right midfielder has abundant stamina. Tiel Fu Ni serves as the center back, coordinating the front and back. Hannibo has transferred to the West Union team and has a good reputation for his performances. In the forward line, the little blonde haired Labour Stoff, assisted by Edward and Glénas on the left and right inside forwards, and Karole Qu and Nuogulov on the wings, their strength should not be underestimated. It is expected that they will fiercely compete with the representative team.</p>

<h3>Six District Cotton Textile Association Dispatches Representatives to Exchange Views with Yarn and Cloth Control Committee; Chief of Competent Authority Expresses Sympathy for Matters Presented</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the Six District Association, following the instructions of Chairman Yuan, sent five representatives to the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee to exchange views with the chief of the competent authority. The representatives presented the matters in detail, and the chiefs expressed considerable sympathy. It was also decided to discuss further next Monday.</p>
<p>Another News: The Six District Cotton Textile Association issued an opinion on Chairman Yuan's speech:</p>
<p>The members of our association have always strongly supported the government's policy of contract spinning and weaving, unified purchase, and unified sales. The representatives dispatched this time to present opinions to Chairman Yuan were, as expected, told that they would be considered and referred to the competent authority for joint study. However, in yesterday's speech, Chairman Yuan mistakenly regarded the well-intentioned suggestions provided by our association as an attempt to coerce and defy the government, and the wording was stern, which caused members to go to the association to question him. At the beginning of constitutional government, Chairman Yuan's expression is deeply regrettable. The crisis in China's textile industry under the threat of Japan's rise is serious and obvious to all. Chairman Yuan, in his capacity as the person in charge, instead believes that the declaration drafted by our association, explaining the crisis as "unnecessary worries," is a misunderstanding. As for the six points of our association's opinion, whether there is any intention of coercion, we now specifically disclose them in the newspaper to clarify the truth. As for the matter of resident factory commissioners, since contract spinning factories are specifically responsible, there are regulations to be followed, and in fact, there is no need to set them up, which is also the real situation. The current panic over raw cotton has long been recognized by all parties. The members of our association are concerned about the survival of their businesses, which are related to the national economy, people's livelihood, and social stability. Please note that there is no intention to create alarmist remarks. Now that Chairman Yuan has stated that there is absolutely no problem, the factories are very pleased to hear this. We only hope that the supply of raw cotton will be uninterrupted, so that the factories will not be forced to shut down, and thus trouble Chairman Yuan to "enforce the law."</p>
<p>In short, the members of our association support national policies and dare not lag behind. The issue today is how to unite from top to bottom, and for officials and the people to cooperate in order to jointly save this national industry from its deep crisis. As for personal gains and losses, we have long put them aside. What we hope is that the authorities will promote the spirit of caring for this industry and implement reasonable measures. The members of our association will naturally support them wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Key Points of Opinions Provided by the Association</p>
<p>The following are the points presented by the Six District Association to the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee for adoption:</p>
<p>(1) For contract spinning of cotton yarn, the Committee should first allocate raw cotton and deliver the spun cotton yarn in installments.</p>
<p>Since the government entrusts factories to contract spin cotton yarn, it should first allocate raw cotton to facilitate contract spinning and delivery of yarn in installments. Moreover, the raw cotton reserves of various factories are weak and will soon be exhausted. If the Committee does not allocate raw cotton first, in case it is too late to help, and leads to shutdowns, serious consequences will inevitably occur.</p>
<p>(2) The amount of cotton and processing fees per piece of contract spun cotton yarn should be calculated entirely according to the original plan set by the General Administration, based on the standard of equivalent and identical American cotton, and with the original plan of September as the base period, calculated monthly with reference to various indexes.</p>
<p>It is found that the General Administration's plan to exchange 712.5 pounds of cotton for one piece of 20-count cotton yarn was set in September, and the cotton supplied was all American cotton. In the future, if the raw cotton used for contract spinning is the same American cotton, it should be calculated with the same amount of cotton. If the quality of the cotton changes, it should be calculated separately by increasing or decreasing the amount according to the actual quality. In addition, the value of various expenses that make up the processing fee is different, and the rate of change is different. If only the price of cotton is used as the basis for calculation, it will inevitably be inconsistent with the actual processing fee. Therefore, the calculation method should analyze its constituent factors (calculated based on the percentage of various expenses of 20-count cotton yarn in September of last year by the Former Spinning Adjustment Committee), with the original plan of September as the base period, calculated monthly according to various indexes.</p>
<p>(3) Contract spinning processing fees should be allocated twice a month, on the 1st and 16th of each month, according to the processing fee index of the previous month, in order to facilitate turnover. The tail of the monthly index must be cleared before the 5th of the following month.</p>
<p>The operating funds and all expenses of various factories usually rely on the sale of futures yarn to obtain funds first, in order to meet payments with goods. If the management method is implemented, the factories will not be able to sell yarn, and it will be difficult to turn around. They will have to rely on advance payments of processing fees for replenishment.</p>
<p>(4) The contract spun cotton yarn should be collected and handed over within the factory in principle, in order to standardize costs and avoid imbalances. Contract spinning factories are scattered in various places. If the location for collecting cotton and handing over yarn is concentrated in one place, the varying distances will affect the level of costs. It is better to collect and hand over at the factory in principle, in order to standardize.</p>
<p>(5) Yarn factories with outdated equipment have higher spinning costs, and the Committee should grant appropriate subsidies.</p>
<p>Yarn factories that were established for a long time mostly have outdated equipment, and the number of spun yarns per day cannot reach the standard. The Committee should grant appropriate subsidies.</p>
<p>(6) Factories are sometimes shut down due to power restrictions, and those that generate their own electricity are also affected by the sharp increase in power costs, which affects costs. The Committee should find ways to subsidize them.</p>
<p>Factories are forced to shut down due to power shortages, resulting in not being able to produce as much as possible, which greatly affects processing fees. For yarn factories that generate their own electricity, it is difficult to purchase fuel coal, and power costs exceed the budget. The Committee should find ways to remedy this.</p>
<p>Cloth and Yarn Weakness Returns; Cotton Prices Turn Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was extremely weak due to the strict enforcement of the control policy. Although the money market tended to be relaxed, sales were sluggish due to the approaching end of the month. Domestic traders and reproduction manufacturers rarely adopted [cotton], and the selling sentiment was strong, with prices falling. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 57.8 million yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns such as 10-count, 16-count, and 32-count and 40-count all fell by 100,000 to 890,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth opened in the morning due to scattered sellers competing to enter the market, and prices rose again. A large number of Dragon Head fine cloth was traded at 1.63 million yuan, and Five Blessings fine cloth reached a maximum of 1.322 million yuan. Later, due to the opening of cloth by the Textile Construction Company, which supplied and sold in large quantities, powerful cloth merchants and dyeing factories successively competed for funds, and prices gradually fell. Until the end, each grade of 12-pound fine cloth fell by 1,000 to 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, serge and zhigong prices also fell by 20,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also appeared to be weak.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Textile Construction Company sold 34 types of cotton cloth as usual. 3A Color Ball fine cloth sold for 1.255 million yuan, 5225 Umbrella fine cloth for 1.85 million yuan, Four Gentlemen Yuan serge for 1.515 million yuan, Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance for 1.5 million yuan, Four Gentlemen Zhigong gabardine for 1.645 million yuan. The matching price was not much different from the market price. A total of 13,360 pieces of cloth, 20 quilt covers, and 3,000 yards of Yonglong single cloth were sold. A total of 289 purchase orders were received, of which 10 were from manufacturers, purchasing 1,920 pieces of cloth, and the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market turned from flat to firm. The Textile Construction Company opened prices to purchase, and the sales became heated. Traders competed to sell, and prices rose by 50,000 yuan per load compared to the previous day. 363 bales were traded. The price for delivery to the factory was 5.497 million and 5.373 million for Hankou fine lint, 5.952 million for Tolyst, and 5.87 million for Shandong wooden frame. In addition, the delivery price at the warehouse was 5.332 million for Hankou fine lint and 1.245 million for Zhoupu seed cotton.</p>
<p>China Trust Bureau Agrees on</p>
<p>Rayon List Prices</p>
<p>From February 2 to 7</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At yesterday's rayon meeting, the China Trust Bureau decided on the following rayon list prices for February 2 to 7: Toyo 1A 70.68 million yuan, 2A 69.26 million yuan, 3A 67.14 million yuan, 4A 63.62 million yuan.

Others 1A 69.88 million yuan, 2A 68.48 million yuan, 3A 66.38 million yuan, 4A 62.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Trade Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market was slightly weak in the morning, and the afternoon's market was similar to the previous day. Asahi's 120-count glossy rayon opened at 87 million yuan with some transactions. However, because non-industry people sold due to capital relations, it declined. The closing price for immediate delivery was 6 million yuan, and the transaction price for Monday's payment in the afternoon was 7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Yarn Yesterday's market was quiet, and there were few transactions at all levels. Because retailers had no appetite, there was also a lack of import and export among traders. There were only two or three bales of zero-lot transactions. The transaction prices and the asking prices at all levels were similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Silk Goods Yesterday's market was stable. The immediate delivery price for the largest Huaqiang Zhensibei surface was 40.5 million yuan. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, the closing price dropped to 200,000 yuan. The one-week delivery price was 900,000 yuan. Since one-week delivery, the next-day market for quilt covers has been temporarily suspended. The asking prices for Da Ge Zi silk gauze were similar to the previous day, and there were also no changes in other goods.</p>
<h3>Although Grain Has a Source, Market Prices Still Rise Sharply; Raw Vegetables and Bean Oil Also Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 9,800 dan of grain arrived in the north and south markets, and the market prices rose sharply. Japonica rice rose sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, indica rice rose rapidly by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and Baiyuan rice also increased by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The situation was chaotic, and there was no formal market price. High-quality Japonica rice stood out, exceeding the 1.5 million yuan mark.</p>
<p>Flour sales turned strong, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Wheat bran followed suit, rising by 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were flat, and cargo owners were firm, rising by another 20,000 yuan. Yellow beans were purchased by oil factories and local merchants, competing with each other, and the supply could not meet the demand, continuing to rise sharply by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Mung beans were slow to sell. Gao Ding was the second-slowest, and red beans followed suit, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were not many cowpea transactions, leading to an increase of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum stocks have dried up, rising sharply by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Corn sales from the north turned smooth, soaring by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Sesame from Tianjin fell back, and sales from customers stopped, resulting in a nominally flat but actually weak market. Raw peanuts from the Guangdong traders were fragrant and dry, and local merchants were also eager, rising by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market's appetite strengthened, and prices continued to rise. Bean oil rose rapidly by 200,000 yuan, raw oil also rose by more than 100,000 yuan, vegetable oil soared by 200,000 yuan, sesame oil also increased by more than 100,000 yuan, and the price of wheat was stable.</p>
<p>Fine Yarn Mills Lack Raw Materials, Textile Construction Hopes for Emergency Relief</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The second session of the eighth meeting of the China Textile Construction Corporation was held at 3 PM yesterday, chaired by Chen Qitian. Four important discussion items were on the agenda: Raw Material Issues: Most of the Textile Construction equipment is for fine yarn, but the raw materials for fine yarn are currently only enough for two months. It is hoped that 100,000 bales of foreign cotton for fine yarn will be imported as an emergency relief. Fuel Issues: The government is trying to make it possible for 300,000 tons of Kaiyan coal to be shipped south each month. 30,000 tons of foreign coal will be ordered, and the Hubei and Hunan areas in the Yangtze River basin are also increasing production, so the fuel supply can be expected to move in the near future. Auditing Issues: The Executive Yuan has recently drafted two kinds of simplified auditing methods and management methods for state-owned enterprises. For the structural business of state-owned businesses, it is hoped that a post-audit can be conducted, and then the Textile Construction will send a formal letter to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review and approval. Treatment Issues: The National Economic Council recently passed a method of treating state-owned enterprise employees, which has an impact on the situation of factory directors of the Textile Construction. It is proposed that the government should reconsider it.</p>
<p>[Another News] In order to adapt to needs, Textile Construction has recently established a Suzhou office, a transport team (equipped with 50 to 100 transport vehicles and 20 iron and wooden boats), and plans to establish a technical research committee to cultivate technical talent.</p>
<p>The Bull Camp Collapses; Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline</p>
<p>Although Chinese stocks rose yesterday at the opening due to the residual momentum of the previous close, it was short-lived. The local labor strike at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory fueled the selling sentiment. The bull camps of large buyers Nos. 148 and 43 collapsed, and things got worse and worse. The decline could not be stopped, and a tragic drop ensued, ending in an unfavorable state.</p>
<p>The morning opened steadily. Yong Yarn entered the market with a small show of strength at 760 yuan and 775 yuan. After the opening, No. 148 continued to enter for immediate delivery, and No. 193 entered for deferred delivery, reaching high prices of 765 yuan and 779 yuan. Nos. 235, 185, 85, 61, 35, and 151 sold for immediate delivery, and Nos. 76, 207, 125, 197, and 60 sold for deferred delivery, forcing the price down to 736 yuan and 758 yuan, before slightly hovering. National Goods were listed by Nos. 106 and 175 at the limit up price. The outside interest rate was slightly lower, at 31.5 cents and 36 cents. Amidst the sound, Nos. 117, 231, and 202 came to sell for immediate delivery, but still could not support it, forcing Nos. 148 and 43 to come to cut their losses. A large investor, Mr. Ye, and others sold off the market, and things got worse. No. 193 sold for deferred delivery, and Nos. 152 and 71 also sold for immediate delivery. Near noon, there was no support, and the price fell to low prices of 705 yuan and 726 yuan before Nos. 157, 235, and 74 accepted cash, and the price rebounded to 715 yuan and 733 yuan. Nos. 155 and 130 sold again for immediate delivery, and No. 148 was still able to close, and the noon close fell again to 710 yuan and 729 yuan. Only National Goods were still at the limit up price, matches were flat, and everything else could not be supported. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, matches were still flat in terms of immediate delivery stocks, while Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Xinyi, Huayi, Xinguang, Jingfu, Annei, Zhabei, and Qinxing Zhongni fell by half a percent, Meiya, Xinhua, and Tongyi fell by 10%, and the rest suffered slight setbacks. In terms of deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng suffered a slight setback, while Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing all fell by half a percent. Various unlisted stocks off the market were still falling.</p>
<p>Hoarding Soybeans Will Be Punished According to Regulations</p>
<p>The city's Social Affairs Bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Food stipulating that grain merchants hoarding soybeans will be punished in accordance with the "Anti-Food Management Regulations." The maximum quantity is based on the weight of grain. According to the calculation, eight dou of soybeans is equivalent to one load of rice. Soybeans are raw materials for oil extraction and are necessities for people's livelihoods. Therefore, the Ministry of Food issued this order to prevent hoarding for profit.</p>
<p>Storage and Transportation Bureau's Wheat Can Be Imported Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The 8,000 tons of relief wheat handled by the Ministry of Communications' Storage and Transportation Bureau, loaded on the U.S. President Lines' Hawaii, transported from Galveston, USA, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. Due to heavy fog at sea, navigation was difficult, and it could not arrive on schedule. According to news from the company, it will definitely be imported this morning and berthed at No. 2 and No. 3 buoys for unloading.</p>
<p>Summer Woolen Goods Sell Relatively Well</p>
<p>The woolen market is deserted due to weak actual sales, high interest rates, and the high prices under the current economy, resulting in weak purchasing power. All retail transactions have become desolate. All standards have therefore tended to be flat. Yesterday, except for summer goods, which were relatively firm, everything else formed a nominal flat but actually declining reality. Outerwear fabrics, thick fabrics, and Mac Arden, etc., have shrunk even more.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Rebound; Foreign Stocks Weaken</h3>
<p>Government bonds rebounded yesterday. Tongbing opened at 65,000, rising from 63,000 to 72,000, and then leveled off slightly. 6 million were traded. Compared to the previous close, A, B, and E rose by 5,000 yuan, type C rose by 7,000 yuan, and Tongding also rose by 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were slightly weak yesterday, with Hong Kong Electric slightly rising to 3.35 yuan. Foreign firms were buying, and securities firms were selling with enthusiasm. Yisha opened in the morning at 555,000, falling to 525,000, and then slightly traded. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Deutsche Bank, Industry, and Cultivation were still flat, while Yeguang Telephone fell by half a percent, and the rest of the stocks were slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Second Term of U.S. Treasury Bills on Sale Until the End of March</h3>

<h3>Allied Bonds Must Be Exchanged by the Deadline; Overdue Amounts Will Be Donated to the National Treasury</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It was recently stipulated by the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank of China that the bonds must be exchanged before the end of March of this year, and any overdue amounts will be donated to the country and turned over to the treasury. As for the Allied bonds from the 31st and 32nd years, if there are any that have not been exchanged, they must also be exchanged before the end of March of this year, and any overdue amounts will be donated to the country and turned over to the treasury for verification and cancellation.</p>
<h3>Measures for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to South China Are Abolished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Previously, the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee implemented comprehensive control of yarn and cloth, and the measures for issuing certificates for transporting yarn and cloth should be uniformly stipulated by the Committee. With the approval of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been requested to forward the "Provisional Management Measures for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to South China" and the "Simplified Rules for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Transported to South China" from the date of implementation of the comprehensive unified purchase and unified sale.

<h3>Spraying Can and Cat</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>When a fire broke out in the east gate, neighbors busily carried buckets and containers, pouring water to extinguish the blaze. As everyone was frantic, exhausted, and the fire was still far from being under control, one person had a unique idea. He believed that such firefighting might endanger the nearby wooden houses that were already scorched but not yet ignited. Therefore, to prevent the fire from spreading, he proposed collecting 5,000 watering cans for "watering flowers" around the fire site to contain the flames!</p>
<p>I had just finished writing the exclamation mark above when a friend happened to come in. Seeing this passage, he said that such a thing was too obviously fabricated and had no basis in reality. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. This was indeed fabricated, but it was based on a template, copied according to a format. The template was a recent United Press International dispatch: the American Cat Society planned to seek 50,000 cats in 39 states, as well as Canada, Costa Rica, and other places, and transport them to Europe to eradicate the rat infestation—to catch the rats that were competing with hungry Europeans for food.</p>
<p>I remember a short article published in this column some time ago: "The Destiny of Cats." When film producers temporarily borrowed several white cats from the zoo to play supporting roles and no longer needed them, the organizer used "appearance on the screen" as a selling point and sold all the cats at a price of $1.50 each. Otherwise, they would have been the perfect candidates for the Cat Society Chairman Connor Lick's recruitment.</p>
<p>However, what makes us suspicious is that if these 50,000 cats arrive in Europe and, by chance, several tens of percent of them are just filling the ranks, are utter lazybones, then not only will they not be able to eradicate the rat infestation, but they will also increase the severity of competing with hungry people for food. What then? If the collected cats are all good at catching rats, to the point that the rat infestation is eliminated one day, will these 50,000 cats continue to stay in Europe and compete with the hungry for food? Or will Connor Lick recall the elite troops, with each cat wearing a medal around its neck "for meritorious service"? The dispatch did not specify, and those as confused as I am cannot help but ask these two questions.</p>
<p>I do not know the specific details of the actual situation of the hungry people in Europe because I am ignorant and ill-informed. But since they are called hungry people, I imagine they certainly do not have food for the next day. Even if they keep a little, they generally would not leave it on the table overnight for the rats to feast on. Therefore, the object of the rats' competition for food in Europe is not the hungry people, but the "red mansions" reeking of wine and meat! In other words, only the "red mansions" would think of keeping cats to catch rats. The hungry people would not feed their only black bread to a cat, so that it could energetically catch the rats that steal the black bread at night! This is another "haha" after "lending 100 yuan to a country in need of relief."</p>
<h3>Housing Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Housing charity lottery tickets have become a topic of conversation for lower and middle-class citizens in their spare time. Civil servants, teachers, clerks, and even students and workers all have a ticket in hand, harboring boundless hopes for this piece of paper, which is printed as finely as an item costing twice the 5,000 yuan in customs gold. Don't underestimate it, it may be worth several gold bars in the near future. Of course, 100,000 yuan is nothing to speak of, but for people who earn just over a million a month, they would have to save for one or two months to scrape it together. Three or four colleagues casually chat, starting from salary increases, adjustments in treatment, and annual bonuses, and finally, when everyone sighs, they can't help but pull out that lottery ticket. Then, a surge of hope sweeps through their hearts, and the topic turns to housing. Perhaps A has a girlfriend and is worried about not being able to find a house, B has a new baby and the small room is too cramped, and C, although single, knows that a house is money, and isn't he going to have to pay back a considerable loan in the next few years? Buying one more lottery ticket means adding one more point of hope. Instead of taking the tram every day, they walk to work. They buy one less pound of milk powder for the child and make do with milk biscuits. They even stay up one more hour to write an article. As long as they are lucky enough to win, they can take a rickshaw to the office, buy cod liver oil and beef juice, and even light a pot of charcoal fire on a cold night.</p>
<p>This is truly a "win-win" good deed. Many people are making such judgments about housing charity lottery tickets. Winning the lottery is naturally something to celebrate, and even if one doesn't win, it's like making a donation, and the beneficiaries are still fellow countrymen in distress.</p>
<p>There is one hope in hundreds of thousands of lottery tickets, and millions of people yearn for this one hope. The probability of winning is almost zero. The hope of one or two lucky people is realized, while the hope of thousands upon thousands of people is dashed. But what does it matter if hope is dashed? 100,000 yuan is not enough to eat a Western meal, not enough to drink a sip of foreign wine. But it is enough to take the public bus for a month. In the weather of December, the northwest wind is mixed with snowflakes, isn't the public bus warm and fast? It's enough to eat one more ball of Cifan in the morning. It's really not a good feeling to go to the office on an empty stomach. It's enough to buy a pound of milk powder for the child. Isn't the child as thin as a monkey?</p>
<p>Relief is a good thing. As the end of the year approaches, it's best to say less about disappointing things. I wish everyone good luck and may you win a top prize!</p>
<h3>Governing by Knots</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>It is most appropriate to use idioms according to the occasion, such as "Cangjie created writing" at the Cangjie Temple and "Prime Minister's Shrine" at the Zhuge Kongming Shrine. During the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Gui Yuangong of Kunshan was an eccentric scholar. He once wrote on his door on New Year's Eve: "One spear stabs out the poor ghost, and double hooks pull in the god." His unconventional behavior was often like this. People at the time called him "crazy." He was very poor, his clothes were so tattered that they could not be patched, and his chairs were so broken that they could not be sat on, so he tied them all with rope and wrote on his door during the Laba Festival: "Governing by knots." Everyone who saw it burst into laughter.</p>
<h3>Trying on New Clothes for the First Time</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>The shop assistant from the Western clothing store brought me the new Western suit I had ordered. I took off the old silk-padded robe and tried on the new clothes for the first time, feeling a sense of renewal all over my body. It reminded me of some small experiences with wearing Western suits, so I wrote them down as a record. Readers, please consider this a foolish person's small insight.</p>
<p>I remember when I wore my first few Western suits, partly because it was not long after I "converted" and I did not understand the "three mysteries" of wearing Western suits, and partly because at that time I did not have a deep understanding of the "difficulty of material resources." Therefore, when I wore Western suits, I was very casual, often stuffing many things in my pockets, such as cigarette cases, wallets, matchboxes, handkerchiefs, candies, and notebooks, making them bulge out. Once, I suffered a big loss. I put a bag of "chicken dumplings" made by a halal teahouse in my pocket, which aroused the appetite of mice and was bitten into two holes.</p>
<p>I also liked to put my hands in the pockets of the jacket and trousers, so that the clothes were easily deformed and the seams were easily torn. Many young people I have seen seem to have the same habit as me. Of course, they cannot leave people with the impression of neat clothing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I wore my pants very low, and over time, even though the trouser legs were lined, they were inevitably worn out. The wool fibers on the edges of the trouser legs were torn open, making them look very ugly. In addition, I usually did not pay much attention to my sitting posture, sometimes straightening my legs and sometimes leaning back. After a week or two, the back of the pants became shiny.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wore a new Western suit and went out, regardless of the bad weather, and came back soaked in the rain. There were also times when I wore a coat that was too small over a Western suit that was too tight in the shoulders. After wearing it once or twice, the Western suit inside immediately changed its shape.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the rise in prices, the gap between monthly salary income and purchasing power has widened day by day. It is becoming more and more difficult to buy a new Western suit, and the degree of cherishing it has also deepened. Currently, I have a total of five Western suits in my wardrobe, including the newly made ones, which look as good as new. The quantity is naturally very small, but as long as I pay attention to them at all times, I think they can be worn twice as long.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Jin Bihui</h3>
<p>— Shu Yu</p>
<p>Speaking of the three words "Jin Bihui," everyone may still feel unfamiliar, but when mentioning the name "Kawashima Yoshiko," I think everyone will be more familiar. Originally, Jin Bihui was the daughter of Prince Su of the former Qing Dynasty, Shanshenqi, who had once reformed the Qing government, released Wang Jingwei, and later plotted to restore the dynasty but failed. He fled to Japan. She lost her father at the age of three, and her mother also died in martyrdom. Therefore, she was taken to Japan by Kawashima Naniwa, a Japanese who was entrusted with the important task of raising her, and gave her the name Kawashima Yoshiko.</p>
<p>Kawashima Naniwa had been treated generously by the Qing court, founded the Chinese police administration, and was a close friend of Prince Su. He was a pro-China "China expert." Because he had no children himself, he regarded Jin as his own, dressed her in men's clothing, taught her the art of riding and shooting, and often instilled ideas of Sino-Japanese friendship in extracurricular activities. Jin Bihui received strict patriotic education from her adoptive father from an early age, which laid the foundation for her future arrogance.</p>
<p>However, Prince Su's children were not limited to Jin Bihui alone (it is said that there were as many as ten, eight sons and two daughters). Initially, they were all entrusted to Kawashima. Jin was young and outstanding. On her fourth birthday, her adoptive father asked her what she wanted. She replied that she wanted the world, so she was valued by Kawashima. Therefore, he kept her alone by his side to raise her, and the other nine were scattered elsewhere to be raised. They did not meet each other on weekdays, and Kawashima did not even let Jin Bihui know about this. It was not until she was ten years old that her brother Xiankai told her that she was Chinese. When she was fifteen years old, the "September 18th Incident" occurred, and Japanese students in China questioned the Japanese government. The Japanese government arrested the students, and Jin also participated and was detained for more than three months before she was released. Only then did she realize that she was Chinese and planned to return to China.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 21st year of the Republic of China (that is, the year after the "September 18th Incident"), she was only a sixteen-year-old girl. One day after school, she secretly boarded a ship and ran to Shanghai. This was the first act of her complex and unpredictable social life after she left her family and school, and it was also a major turning point in her thinking in life. After living in Shanghai for four months, her half-brother Jin Bidong rushed to Shanghai from the Northeast and took her to Changchun (then the capital of the puppet Manchukuo, called Xinjing). It is said that she did not know until then that she was a descendant of the Aisin Gioro clan. Therefore, she ran to Rehe to visit the grave and went to the birthplace of Changbai Mountain.</p>
<p>In her "turbulent" life, she was deceived three times, which may not be well known to the general public, but they were all closely related to her fate.</p>
<p>The first deception, as mentioned above, was being deceived by Kawashima, so that she did not know her true origin until she was sixteen years old.</p>
<p>The second time she was deceived was when she was entrusted by her brother Jin Bidong to lead 5,000 troops to Changbai Mountain to plot to support the Qing Dynasty and welcome Puyi back to Rehe. However, because she had not contacted the Japanese military department in advance, she was bombed by Japanese planes and forced to disband. At that time, the commander of the Japanese army, Tada, feigned to provide military supplies and lured them back to Changchun in a special car, and the matter was shelved.</p>
<p>After that, Su Bingwen revolted, but she did not let anyone know. She only left a letter, flew a plane to Manzhouli, and parachuted down, intending to surrender to Su. When all the Japanese who had been detained by the Su army ran back to Japan, the Japanese army on the ground began a general offensive and tied her up, leaving her alone in the Su army. Because she was alert, she escaped from the Mongolian tent and went to Tianjin to open the "Dongxinglou" restaurant. The last time she was deceived can be said to be the most dangerous, and almost her life was lost by the insidious and cunning Japanese army.</p>
<p>Once, she had a falling out with Yamaga Kyo, the chief of the press department of the Japanese army's Beiping headquarters. Yamaga was originally Kawashima Naniwa's secretary, but he was later expelled. He abused the people and extorted money in Beiping, which Jin was very dissatisfied with. She suddenly came up with a "Japanese-style landlord's method" to punish Yamaga, greatly humiliating him. Yamaga harbored resentment and retaliated, issuing a "banishment order" to expel her from all of China. She spent two years in confinement in the Kyushu University Hospital in Japan.</p>
<p>Jin Bihui's lifelong dream was to use the power of Japan to restore the imperial cause of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Her life's energy was also devoted to this. However, as a result of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japan was defeated, and her dream was shattered like a bubble. She was arrested in Beiping on October 11, 1945, and has been imprisoned for more than two years. The Hebei High Court sentenced her to death for treason. She refused to accept the sentence and petitioned the Supreme Court for a retrial. She said, "Born in bewilderment, die in bewilderment, this is my life." Facing the strict national law, what "bewilderment" can she use again!</p>
<h3>Talking about Crying</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>There are different ways to cry. Crying with tears but no sound is called weeping. Crying with sound but no tears is called wailing. Crying with both tears and sound is called sobbing. However, when one slips of the tongue, it is all called crying.</p>
<p>Crying should be a genuine outpouring of emotion. When people encounter grief or sorrow, they often cannot help but cry, wail, and stamp their feet, venting their emotions. However, when they are overjoyed, their eyes often fill with tears, and they cry with joy.</p>
<p>However, crying is not something that men often do. There is a saying that "men's tears are like gold, and women's tears are like water." Although this saying contains feudal implications of valuing men over women, the actual situation is also like this. Women do cry a little more often than men, the reason for which is that men's emotions are more resistant to training and can withstand storms, unlike women, who are so fragile. However, there are exceptions. When encountering certain situations, perhaps men cry more fiercely and more painfully than women. That is the case of "a hero does not shed tears easily, only when he is truly heartbroken."</p>
<p>As far back as the Warring States period, Shen Baoxu begged for troops in the Qin court. He cried for nine consecutive days without eating or sleeping. As a result, he finally moved the heart of the King of Qin, who agreed to lend troops to restore his homeland, and only then did his crying stop. Shen Baoxu can be regarded as a person who understands the principle of crying. His constant crying was naturally a means, but on the one hand, it was because he had made a road with Wu Zixu, to fulfill the promise of "if you can overturn Chu, I will definitely restore Chu." On the other hand, it may not have been because his homeland was destroyed, and tears came from his painful intestines, and he was extremely sad. Otherwise, where would such lasting tears come from?</p>
<p>This story of crying occurred very early and was admired and praised by later generations because Shen Baoxu's crying actually brought rescue troops and achieved the wish of restoring the country. Later, according to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a hero like Liu Bei, when Lu Zijing was ordered to ask him to return Jingzhou, also used Shen Baoxu's method, exchanging Zi Jing's sympathy with a look of "urgent tears," causing him to "enter a treasure mountain empty-handed" and return in vain. This was due to Zi Jing's sincerity and kindness, and it can also be seen that the magic power of crying is great. No wonder that in the late nineteenth century, when European guns and cannons had entered China, there was still a Manchu, Wen Ti, who believed that crying could repel the enemy and wanted to be Shen Baoxu II. At the beginning, when Russia forcibly leased Lushun and Dalian, Wen Ti volunteered to go to Russia to argue, saying that he would cry bitterly and follow Shen Baoxu's example of not eating for nine days. If Russia insisted, he would immediately commit suicide, so that he could move Britain and Japan to help him. In his memorial, he also said, "This slave has no parents in the hall, and wives and concubines in the room. He has long had the intention of repaying the country with his death. He can die in his place and move the nations of the earth." Fortunately, Emperor Guangxu still had a little brain and did not allow it. Otherwise, this joke would have been a big one. It is also dangerous to be inflexible and not adapt to changing circumstances.</p>
<p>According to reports a few days ago, in the public trial of the Jiang Customs embezzlement case in Beijing, the three main characters, Yin Lansun, Zhang Baohui, and Yue Xinmin, all performed a "crying in court" scene. One was "tears streaming down, unable to speak," another was "speaking with a crying voice," and the last one was "silent tears." They all unanimously "regretted being tricked by merchants," which can be said to be extremely wonderful! However, regardless of whether they were "tears from painful intestines" or deliberately acting, their motives were the same, all wanting to show repentance with "tears" in order to move the compassion of the judges and reduce their crimes. Without knowing the law, it is difficult to violate it. Even if the judges are sincere and kind, they may not be able to do anything. "One wrong step will cause eternal regret." It is difficult to wash away with the water of the Yangtze River, so what can the tears do!</p>
<h3>Remembering Yue Ying</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>Last February in Shanghai, I learned from my friend Ba Jin that Yue Ying had died, and had been dead for several years, and had died in Shanghai. I often think of him and always want to write something to commemorate him, because he was an ordinary person. Perhaps it is because he was an ordinary person that I miss him. Also, he was a very lovable friend among our friends. The first time I knew of him was in 1930 when I read his translation of "The Working Girl Madeleine" in the New Woman Monthly. I met him in Paris in 1932. At that time, he was living in a hotel in Billancourf. I can't remember how I met him, because none of my friends who lived with me in Arouil knew him. Since meeting him, I would visit him once every week until I left Paris for Brussels. After going to Brussels, I remember that we exchanged one or two letters. At that time, he was working in a glass factory near Billancourf. This glass factory specialized in engraving, that is, engraving on glass products. Most of the products were exported, mainly to England and the United States. He often told me that he wanted to raise some capital after returning to China and open a glass engraving factory. This is not only a profitable industry, but also an art. I encouraged him very much, but I forgot that China could not even make flat glass ash well, so how could we talk about such noble glass manufacturing. When we met, in addition to talking about engraved glass, we occasionally talked about reading, translating books, raising tropical fish, and some of his trivial romances. He raised two tropical fish, which were given to him by his factory owner. About half a year later, his tropical fish had bred several more. This was his most proud thing. He lived in France for more than ten years. He never married, but he had many girlfriends, and they were of all kinds, so I said they were some trivial romances. His health was very bad. According to my friend Ba Jin, he was not very successful in Shanghai after returning to China. He worked in some bank for some time, and also opened a restaurant for a while, which was beyond my expectations. He fell ill not long after returning to China, and died not long after. In France, glass engraving is an emerging industry. Not many French people understand this technology. At present, it is said that there is probably only one Chinese person, Yue Ying. After returning to China, he did not have a chance to develop his technology, which is a pity. It is not an exaggeration to say that Chinese society has buried him. In fact, Yue Ying is not the only one who has been buried.</p>
<h3>A Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (59)</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Zhang said, "Being so timid and hesitant, you can't get anything done." Yunqing said, "Mother, you have to think about it. If we tell Zhuzhai's father, even if he listens to us completely and prevents Zhuzhai from marrying Qihuan, and things are done, what will happen afterward? What will Zhuzhai think of us for ruining his good fortune? Furthermore, if others see this, they will think we orchestrated the whole thing. We'll be disliked no matter what. Why should we bother with this?" Old Mrs. Zhang said, "According to you, it's none of our business and we can ignore it. Then why are you sighing all day long? If you take it lightly, I won't be anxious either!" Yunqing listened and remained silent. Because she was only thinking in her heart that she couldn't show her face at this point. If she did, she would surely incur Zhuzhai's resentment, planting a bad seed, and there would be no good outcome in the future. She couldn't express this kind of hardship for a while, and she didn't sleep all night again. Finally, she suddenly thought that Fei Xiaobai was Zhuzhai's uncle, and Zhuzhai's father was very close to him. If he spoke, it would definitely be effective. Xiaobai's thinking is very detailed, and he will handle this matter very thoughtfully. Yunqing thought of Fei Xiaobai, as if she had found a savior, knowing that Xiaobai had to get up after 4 o'clock every day. That day, she waited until after 4 o'clock and hired a car to Fei's residence. Xiaobai had just gotten up. Xiaobai and Old Mrs. Zhang were also relatives. Yunqing used to love studying opera and often came to Xiaobai's house to ask for advice. Xiaobai liked her cleverness and steadiness, and cherished her very much. This day, Yunqing walked into the courtyard. Xiaobai was teasing the parrot on the veranda. He saw Yunqing coming in at a glance and smiled, "You came just in time. Help me. I taught her to sing 'Visiting Mother,' but she only learned one sentence and then stopped learning. You come, sing two sentences to tease him. You are a stranger, and your voice is crisp, he will definitely learn." Yunqing knew Xiaobai's temper, if he asked you to do something, you had to do it immediately, then he would be very happy. If you procrastinated, he would get angry and not ask you to do it. Today, she was full of sadness and had no mood to sing opera and tease the parrot, but she came here to ask Xiaobai for help, so she had to curry favor and smiled, "Which section do you want me to sing?" Xiaobai said, "Don't sing a section, just sing two sentences: 'The sun shines brightly, the spring is beautiful, and the birds sing happily'." Yunqing indeed sang these two sentences while turning her back. She only saw the parrot looking east and west, his two eyes, as if searching for something.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Answered by Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</p>
<p>[Juxin Company, Fangbang Road asks] Why is there noise in the phone from time to time? How to avoid interference? Why is it slow to connect with public telephones? Are there any financial difficulties?</p>
<p>[Answer] There is noise when the microphone and cord in the phone are damaged. If there is no dial tone or the sound is mixed after the earpiece is taken off, it means that the switchboard is busy. Hang up the earpiece and wait a while before calling again. Do not hold the earpiece for a long time or knock on the spring randomly, which may cause the switchboard to malfunction. The connection of public telephones is no different from ordinary telephones.</p>
<p>[Duan Dexing, Zhonghua Road asks] What are the procedures for paying the city telephone bill? Under what circumstances can a long-distance call be cancelled? What is the cancellation fee?</p>
<p>[Answer] In order to facilitate telephone users to pay their fees, the Bureau has entrusted all telephone fees to the following banks for collection from January 1948. Please go to the following locations to pay after receiving the bill: (A) Bank of Communications Hongkou Branch, (B) Bank of Communications Minguo Road Branch, (C) Trust Department of the Central Cooperative Treasury, and this Bureau at Yokohama Bridge, and the Bank of Communications Agency at the General Business Office on Fuzhou Road. Long-distance calls can be cancelled before the scheduled time. The cancellation regulations vary depending on the distance of the road. Please refer to the attached long-distance call price list and emergency notice of this Bureau for details.</p>
