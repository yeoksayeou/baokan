<p>「本人此次來到日本，純是以私人資格作觀察性質的旅行，毫不含有代表的意義予不負有任何具體任務。本人在一九四五年從美國治病回國，經過日本，曾受麥克阿瑟元帥優厚的款待，可惜因事亟須回國，在日本共住了三天，久想再來，因爲職務覊絆，到今天才達到這個願望。戰後日本和平民主　設的進程，是日本國家復與的保障，也是日本與中國以及並世國家永久合作關係的基礎。每一個關心日本，關心世界大局的人士，都同具此感。本人今天也是本普通種種感想與期待而來，盟軍總部麥克阿瑟元帥的厚誼，給與我此次旅行以便利，至爲感幸。新聞觀者先生們或者有希望本人發表一些意見，但此行旣然是觀察旅行性質，便專重在聽取體認方面，在觀察未得此相當成熟的結果以前，自無若何意見可以發表，尙祈諒察」。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城邪惡一日電〕韓國總統李承晚宣布：彼將邀請赴日之張羣氏來韓一遊。李氏並謂：貧已要求商震將軍來此爲其特別賓客。李氏强調中·韓兩國間之特別友誼時稱：彼已任命韓國駐美大使階級之特使，亦即受任不久之警察總監趙炳玉爲訪華代表團長，該團並將前往菲律素。至總統並稱：韓國議會已通過大赦法案，彼不久即宣布大赦令。</p>

<h3>慶祝本市工業會成立</h3>
<p>工業會法，係於去年十月七日，經立法院通過，同月廿七日，由國府公佈施行。本年三月，復由社會部擬訂施行細則，呈經行政院核准公佈，於是工業會之立法手續，始完全告竣。</p>
<p>社會部以本市爲我國第一工業重心，此項組織，實有提前完成，以增强團結之必要，爰飭本市社會局負責指導各重要同業公會及市屬各工業同業公會，先依新法改組，再行籌組本市工業會，時經四月，各項籌備手續次第完成　定於今日舉行成立大會，社會工商兩部長曁本市各首長，均將出席指導。聞申請入會的團體已達七十三單位，籌備會且已收到提案多件，其中有關於工業政策者，也有關於勞資問題的。這不但是本市工商業組織上的創舉，亦爲我國工業界展開一頁新的歷史。</p>
<p>晚淸以來，人民團體之歷史最久基礎最固者，厥爲商會。凡以製造，販賣，運輸，融通各項爲業務的，大多數均依法參加，卓然爲各地工商界的領導。依現行商會法，其搆成分子，分爲三大類：卽商業同業工會，公業同業公會及輸出入同業公會是。此次另頒工業會法，而同時將工業同業公會法予以廢止，卽顯示今日工業的發展，已達到相當成熟的階段，應行獨立組織，以順利地發揚其所負的任命。這不但是組纖上的顯著進步，亦是工業本身發展的一種象徵。</p>
<p>在這經濟界動盪不安的時期中，工業環境之壞，甚於其他各業；工業會成立後的任務，其消極性的，彌縫補苴，艱苦支撑，恐遠比積極性的展開工作爲急迫。然而這種非常現象，我們相信，總不過是過渡時期中臨時的一幕。一俟時局好轉，經濟穩定，工業界所負偉大的使命，必將由工業會的斡旋與領導，而日卽於完成。</p>
<p>就最近所施行的新幣制而論，識者皆以爲幣値之能否鞏固，固繫於物價之安定，而物價之能否安定，則繫於生產之是否增加。所以工業會的前途如何，不單是實業界的自身問題，而實是有關整個國計民生的問題。</p>
<p>至於原有之商會，在工業會成立以後，各種工業公會，旣經改組改隸，在職務上似較前爲輕鬆，但其力量則並不因之而削弱。因爲工商本屬一體，利害原無衝突；且廠家所設的批售處，營業部，門售部等，均屬商業性質，依法仍須加入各該商業公會，依然爲商會的一份子。又工業公會之會員資格，相當嚴格，依照工廠法草案，須具有發動機器平時雇用工人卅人以上，或未具有發動機器，平時雇用工人六十入以上。凡不合上述條件之小型工廠，仍須另組商業同業公會，加入商會。所以工業會的會員，泰半仍須加入商會爲會員，所不同者，只是一家工廠，往往要具有兩重會籍面已。其於對內各種事項的協調，與對外各種問題的交涉，初不因新組織之出現而有所妨碍。反之，正以工業會之成立而聲勢愈壯，這或就是大家歡迎工業會的主要理由之一。總之，此後的商會與工業會，好比車之兩輪，島之兩翼，在這經濟界杌隉不安之秋，要期望着他倆並肩努力克服當前一切的困難。本市工業會今晨呱呱墮地，我們欣逢其誕辰，謹祝我國工業前途無疆。</p>

<h3>莫斯科談判臨成敗關頭　三使節明晤史達林　週末不斷會商調和歧見</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞處社倫敦廿一日電〕美外交部方面今晨宣佈：蘇外長莫洛托大與西歐三强駐莫斯枓代成間，二十日並未舉行會談。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿一日電〕西方國家廿一日急切研究駐蘇使節之報吿並對柏林局勢交換意見，準備下一次之克林姆宮談話。此間及巴黎謠傳下次會議中，史達林將親自出席。又稱，不問成敗，此係最後一次會議，然迄無證　。反之，此間權威人士警吿目前休言成敗，據每一跡象看來，目前東西談判已達生死關頭，然尙無結論性進展。</p>
<p>外相貝文週末擬留倫敦並向艾德禮首相報吿局勢，按艾氏現在愛爾蘭休假。西方國家間不斷熱烈討論，準備應付最重要或係最後一次之談話，此一會議將於廿三日舉行。然官員稱，會議所以延長，因三國政府需要調整意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿一日電〕英政府中央新聞局所發行之半月刋「國際觀察」廿一日暗示，蘇聯在克林姆宮會議中，已拒絕解除柏林封鎖。此一暗示出現時，正値西方外交家警吿衆人目前暫停預測莫斯科談判之成敗。同時蘇聯控制之柏林電台稱，莫斯科報吿「指出」克林姆談判「即將決裂」，然德境之蘇方報紙電台對會談，採取「忽冷忽熱」式態度，旨在使一般人民對成敗均有準備。「國際觀察一對談判內容仍秘而不宣，惟稱「西方國家仍堅持柏林封鎖應在廣泛問題之討論開始前解除</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿一日電〕柏林電台廿一日否認曾報吿「莫斯科電訊表示克林姆宮與西方使節之談判即將決裂」之新聞。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科二十日合衆電〕西方三國本身間意見之分歧，似將延宕西方代表與莫洛托夫間第六次亦或者爲最後一次之會議。消息靈通之觀察家深信，西方三國對於下次會議中，將對莫洛托夫作何種說明一點，尙未能確切獲致協議。過去數日中，各代表曾一再舉行會議，各代表與其本國政府間以及三國政府間亦曾數度交換意見。西方三國代表間顯然存有若千輕微歧異，比種歧異在渠等再度與蘇聯舉行會議前，必須解決。</p>
<h3>柏林蘇軍越界誘捕德警　美軍司令提抗議　武裝英美憲兵駐邊境鎮壓</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿一日電〕柏林美佔區之警察今日由柏林美佔區司令霍萊上校轉遞文件，抗議蘇聯巡邏隊綁架德警察三名，該三名警察係昨日在美蘇區交界處爲若干蘇聯士兵捕去。霍萊上校稱，如渠之抗議無效，則此事將交與其長官辦理。又稱，吾人亦能採取其他措施對付。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿一日電〕美憲兵鎭壓隊三隊，廿一日晚將駐於市中心交界地，蓋蘇方憲警曾不斷在該地捕去英美區之德警察。鎭壓隊每隊廿五人，一應武裝俱全，據跡象看來，蘇方如繼續越界捕人，美方必予抗拒。按鎭壓隊出動事係高級警官在出事地點視察時所決定，而經美方公安組長艾洗華所批准。據報，英官員亦正出動後備，以加强憲兵之實力。廿一日午後英美憲兵士吉普往來交界處街中，德英美蘇人士之好奇者數百人佇立巷左，以待東西警察戰之下一次行動。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿一日電〕蘇聯憲兵廿一日又在柏林逮捕德警察兩人，同時德共領袖號召街頭暴動，敦促工人赴英美蘇三區接壞之波茨坦曼廣塲，「打擊黑市商及法西斯黨徒」。英方官員稱，德警兩人在英佔區一百廿碼內被巡邏波茨坦曼廣塲之蘇憲兵五十名左右以槍口相向，綁架而去。一警士力掙得脫，逃入某一頽傾之房屋，另一人則被拖往蘇區。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿日電〕柏林美軍司令霍萊上校今日發表公報稱，蘇區德警察官若非爲著名作奸犯科者，則十九日普茨達麥地區警察開槍擊傷六人之不幸事件即可避免。馬克格拉夫之繼續担任蘇區警長職，實侮辱柏林人民所選出之市議會，因此一般人民之輕視警察亦不足怪。然無論如何警察不應向非武裝之人民開槍。霍萊末稱，美軍政府已盡力設法撲滅黑市之投機者，然黑市之不能撲減，實由於蘇方之封鎖柏林。</p>
<h3>美軍官著文揭露　蘇征服世界計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日專電〕據華府非官方刋物野戰砲兵報本日稱蘇聯業已通知其各附庸國家謂：遠東，希臘及巴勒斯坦所發生之混亂，將造成有利於克林姆宮征服世界戰略計劃之環境。論文係一退伍上校南沙所執筆。渠稱，蘇聯征服世界計劃，係去年十一月所擬定，並已秘密分發與其　附席國，作爲南針。南氏透露蘇聯計劃之內容，包括四階段；（一）鞏固各附庸國家内部之團結，（二）建立德，義，法三國共黨政府。（三）不戰而征服英國，因其左派政黨勢力日起。（四）美國爲最後之目標，因其經濟危機，確將更爲惡化，而美國共黨將獲得控制工會之權力。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕杜魯門總統今日發布手令，凡適合下列條件之一者，得予緩役：（一）年十九至廿五之有妻及子者，得免平時徵調，但自八月三十日起，仍須應其他徵調。（二）獨身男子負担兄弟，姊妹，祖父母或其他眷屬之生活者。（三）販賣大批主要農產品，數量甚多之從事農作者。（四）從事民族健康與安全所必需之工業者。（五）現役軍人及曾在一九四一年十二月七日至一九四五年九月二日期間服務九十天以上之退役軍人。（六）兄弟姊妹均在第二次大戰中陣亡或殉職，現爲獨子者。（七）敎士。（八）良心譴責者。（九）公務員職至州長，國會議員，或主任委員以及法官者。（十）生理及精神狀態不合格者。</p>
<h3>美高級軍事領袖　羅特島舉行會議　國防長報告美加討論聯防經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿一日電〕據國防部長福萊斯特稱，華盛頓高級軍事領袖擇定於羅特島之海軍大學，舉行爲期三日之會議，討論「重大政策問題」。討論內容雖嚴守秘密，會　期間雖亦不致發表任何公報，但據官方透露，議程上將包括有關戰略性空軍作戰美科學家所硏究出之秘密武器及其應用等問題。福萊斯特將報吿其最近在渥太華舉行美加聯防計劃討論之經過。美空軍參謀長樊登堡今日自歐返美，亦將報吿美空軍調赴柏林之情形。參加會議者，尙有陸軍參謀總長勃雷特萊，軍令及計劃處長魏德邁，及其他海空軍諸高級領袖</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓二十日電〕美國防部長福萊斯特赴加拿大與國防部長克萊斯登會商兩國聯防事務返國後二日，即在羅特島新港海軍學校與海陸空三軍參謀總長舉行秘密會議。據消息靈通方面稱，福氏與克氏之會談結果將列爲議程，但非專以此爲限。會議中並將討論三軍參謀畏三月間在弗里達州基威斯特會議所決定之計劃實行已臻何種地步。按基威斯特會議曾決定海陸空三軍事務之劃一，經福萊斯特之贊助後，已加速進行，惟尙有若千異見存在，尤其爲空軍部長辛明頓堅主設立空軍七十團，而福氏則主六十六團。衆料新港會議將設法完成三軍事務之劃一，並將籌商最佳辦法利用徵兵制下所將召集之新兵。該會議且將討論目前國際局勢所引起之軍事問題，因此將涉及福氏與克氏之會談結果，與加拿大政府在福氏到加前所決定將其陸軍由三萬五千人增至四萬二千人事。聞福氏與克氏曾討論美加合作共同防衛美大陸之北部事。美軍事領袖認此區在戰略上極重要，故須在其四周建設砲合與空軍基地網，俾措安全。</p>
<h3>軍事援西毆　加願與美合作</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社渥太華廿一日電〕據消息靈通方面稱：在美國防部長福萊斯特來此，與加國防部長舉行談判期間，加拿大參加供給布魯塞爾簽字國之軍火一項問題，係主要議程之一。據權威方面消息，加拿大每年可經由美開向西歐國家輸出價値二億美元之軍火。加拿大首都消息靈通人士關於此事亦表示在西歐經濟復與完成前，似有先援助西歐軍事復興之必要。又聞在福萊斯特返國前，渠對於受加政府委託供給加拿大政府有關國内軍事潛能情報之加國防工業委會，極爲注意。</p>
<h3>美國噴射式飛機　七十九架飛抵德</h3>
<p>〔合衆社慕尼黑廿日電〕美空軍廿日宣稱，最近自美抵達蘇格蘭之八十三架F80型噴射式飛機，其中七十九架，業已重行集合飛抵此間附近之機塲。</p>
<h3>美限期蘇總領事離美後　蘇可能採取報復　洛茂金已購定船票下週六離美</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務院廿一日振作精神，以應付莫斯科之新外交攻擎。此間外交界預料美國要求蘇駐紐約總領事洛茂金立即歸國，蘇聯將有迅速而尖刻之反響。官員稱，此事爲戰後兩國間最不愉快事件之一，蘇聯有忿憤之表示。若干人士預料，蘇聯將對駐莫斯科及海參威之美國領事人員，採報復手段。又稱，蘇政府將不得已「而製造若干荒　之罪名，加諸我國官員——然彼等昔已行之矣」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約二十日電〕因在商遜基　案中之「不正當行動」而經國務部要求蘇聯政府召回之洛茂金總領事，業已向二十八日啓椗之「斯德哥爾摩」號郵船，預定船票。雖然洛茂金本人拒絕評述美國政府譴責渠之「非常不當」行爲，渠並對等候於領事館門邊之新聞記者稱：「諸君徒費光陰」，但渠之計劃仍爲瑞美郵船航空公司職員所洩露。該職員稱：洛茂金已在數日前以函件通知該公司，爲渠本人，其妻及其兒二人預定船票。</p>
<h3>蘇策劃南國政變　莫斯科成立「自由南斯拉夫」委會　匈副總理痛斥狄托政權</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿日電〕據中央社記者本日此間獲悉：莫斯科刻正策劃發動南斯拉夫政變，推翻狄托政權，另成立正統史達林派之共黨政府。聞史達林已頒令由僑蘇南共反狄托人士於蘇京成立「自由南斯拉夫委員會」，聞狄托如果推翻，貝柯台獎維區已被指定繼承其位，一般咸料貝氏刻在莫斯科</p>
<p>〔合衆社布達佩斯二十日電〕匈牙利副總理賴柯錫二十日向七萬農人發表演說，指斥狄托元帥之政權，爲使南斯拉夫發生恐怖，痛苦，虐待，以至於悲劇之「匪徒領袖」。渠稱，「狄托及其下屬卑鄙殺害彼等之英雄，在國內全境運用恐怖手段。彼等磨難，禁閉，及虐待凡支持蘇聯，共產情報局，及工會之同志等」。賴氏復抨擊郁伐諾維志中將在企圖出亡至羅馬尼亞時，竟遭南方槍擊致命。在賴氏攻擊此事之前二日，羅馬尼亞公報曾指斥此事爲「卑鄙之謀殺案」。賴氏繼稱，『南斯拉夫目前「匪徒領袖」正將使吾人南鄰發生悲劇』。</p>
<p>此事表示洛茂金在美國政府要求將渠召回前，早已整理行裝。洛茂金之離美計劃，是否係渠已料知國務部之行動，抑或係莫斯科早已令渠返國，以答覆在高案中渠之行動，則未可確定。洛茂金顯然爲唯一決定立即離美之紐約蘇方高級人員。據瑞美郵船航空公司發言人稱：並無其他蘇聯領事館人員預定艙位，回國蘇聯人員，一般均假道瑞典，渠導在哥德堡登陸，乘車至斯德哥爾摩，再乘船至芬蘭，然後乘火車返莫斯科。洛氏之返國消息，最初係哥德堡之瑞美郵船公司職員發出，然後始經此間證實。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓二十日電〕國務部今日已公佈昨日送交蘇聯大使之照會，國務部發言人稱：國務部已聲明撤回對蘇聯駐紐約總領事洛茂金之認可狀，並請米洛氏在七十二小時内離開美國國境，國務部發言人又謂，美國政府不以洛茂金之離職，而認爲高遜基娜與桑馬林案業已結束，此後仍將進行調査。蘇聯領事館方面對美國之照會，無所評述。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日合衆電〕已爲美國要求召回之蘇駐紐約總領事洛茂金，可能於下週啓程返國，面謁其震怒之上司，不幸之洛茂金因三蘇籍敎師事件，使蘇外長莫洛托夫在國際塲合中處境隧意，現已奉令於三四日内結束館務，離美返國。杜魯門總統新聞秘書羅思稱：杜魯門總統不致立即收回洛茂金之信任狀，因立即收回將迫使其立即結束館務而子使館以不必要之負担也。信任狀收回令之簽發，可能於三四天内實行，屆時洛茂金當以蘇聯普通人民之資格而毫無官方頭銜離美矣。各方記者威料洛茂金返國後，或不免於嚴重之責難。高遜基娜夫人所住之醫院發表公報稱：高氏情况已見「轉佳」，但仍未脫險境，進食及呼吸均較前爲佳，體溫已「略减低、脈搏亦接近正常」。</p>

<h3>美國大選前奏曲之三　廉價的政治把戲</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>〔本報紐約八月二日航訊〕在美國歷史上，很少有拿國會會塲，作爲競選活動的地盤。杜魯門總統突如其來的「特別會議」的召集，雖然被塔虎脫駡爲「廉價拍賣的政治把戯」，雖然被范登堡駡爲「垂亡政權臨終以前歇斯底里式的喘息」，但特別會議畢竟開成了，杜魯門這一「辣手」，無疑的，正如「紐約時報」所說，給共和黨在十一月大選的威望上，一個嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>國會開會那天，凡是美國共和黨的報紙，以及跟共和黨有關係的報紙，都刋登了一幅「會塲人數寥寥」的照片，有兩位衆議員，而且把大腿擱在前排座椅上，攝影記者大概是專爲選擇最空的角落照的，因爲實際上，會塲並不見太空，總共四百三十五名的衆議員，這次出席人數有三百一十名，並不較往常特別遜色。星期一開會以前，共和黨的上下兩院議員有一個非正式的會議，商量應付杜魯門的「辣手」。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統到星期二的中午，才去國會演講，念他的講演稿子，僅僅二十四分鐘，他强調美國的經濟危機，特別是通貨膨脹造成的物價上漲的危機。他說：「共產主義者天天在計算着美國經濟不景氣的日子，我們要避免這個不景氣。」他還說：「如果美國的經濟基礎一且有了動搖，則其他世界各部份，遭受的嚴重後患，便不堪想像」。他認爲今天世界的局面非常緊急，爲了應付緊急事變，所以不能等到下屆國會的開會，立即召集這次國會暑假特別會議，來共商國家的大政與大策。</p>
<p>總統的演講，冠冕堂皇，對共和黨是一個正面挑戰，對南方的「死硬派」，杜魯門用避重就輕的辦法，希望輕輕閃過。在全篇演講裏，關於「國民權利法案」，僅僅祗有簡單一百一十三個字，大意是：爲了使美國憲法永遠保特光輝，澈底實現美國公民的自由平等觀念，要剷除種族歧視，人種偏見，不論任何種族的美國公民，都有平等就業的機會，所以提出：國民權利保障法案。</p>
<p>南方的「死硬派」，在國會裏引起强烈的反感，密西西比衆議員考爾墨宣稱，誓死反對杜魯門，南加羅里那州的參議員瓊斯敦主張立即休會，大家回家度暑假。一星期來，國會每次集會辯論，瓊斯敦每次都有一個同樣表示：「根本這次開會就是無聊，浪費精神，浪費金錢，無聊到極點！」他籲請大家，同意他的意見，國會特別會議立即休會，到今年十二月三十一日再開會討論這些法案！」實際上，瓊斯敦並非眞心無意於開會，他是要故意打擊杜魯門，給杜魯門一個「下馬威。」</p>
<p>南方議員中最厲害的，是喬治亞的參議員羅塞爾，他是反對「國民權利保障法案」的首要人物。他知道：南方議員人數少，投票表決必然失敗，所以他主張跟共和黨合作。南方支持共和黨反對杜魯門的「管制物價方案」，希望共和黨支持南方的反對「國民權利法案」。羅塞爾希望把杜魯門所提的「國民權利保障法」，成爲美國憲法修正案，憲法修正案就非尋常普通法律那樣容易通過了。</p>
<p>但是塔虎脫拒絕了羅塞爾的建議，塔虎脫認爲共和黨反對杜魯門所有的提案，唯獨同意杜魯門的「國民權利保障法」，因爲從林肯總統以來，共和黨一貫主張提高黑人的社會地位，共和黨一貫主張人種平等。塔虎脫在國會裏，幾乎是最忙的一個，他是共和黨上下兩院關於內政問題的最高負責人。</p>
<p>塔虎脫的理論根據是：第一，杜魯門對於財政經濟的看法，全非準確，杜魯門的高調，是欺世盜名，欺騙美國老百姓，爭取十一月大選。第二，社魯門本人，並無制止通貨膨脹的意念，因爲今日美國通貨膨脹的形成，是政府濫用金錢，杜魯門不制止行政機構的「濫用」，而到國會來呼籲，完全是玩政治的演說。（美國人對於「玩政治」一詞，人民最爲深惡痛絕，因「玩政治」即非實在之意）。第三，杜魯門的所謂物價管制辦法，完全是「警察國家」的作風，和美國傳統的自由企業觀念背道而馳。</p>
<p>在國會裏，民主黨的正統派，（除了南方「死硬派」以外）多半擁護杜魯門，大辯論家巴克萊，這位七十高齡的肯塔基老參議員，杜魯門的「競選伴侶」，痛斥塔虎脫。他說：塔虎脫自己在玩政治把戯，他認爲國會應該大公無私，爲國民謀福利，不能爲成見所囿。</p>
<p>就大體說，這次特別會議最重要的主題，是物價管制和制止通貨膨脹兩個大問題。總統府經濟顧問委員會，送給國會一個「年中報吿」，裏面分叙就業，工資，生產，留易，以及急漲中的物價等等項目。報吿中有一句說到：共和黨操縱下的國會，在盲目的，不擇手段的加深美國的經濟危機。</p>
<p>共和黨人對這一段非常表示憤慨，他們認爲杜魯門的挑戰，過份兇惡。衆議院銀行專門委員會的主席成爾考，密歇根的共和黨議員，憤懣地指責政府把錢化得太容易，造成信用膨脹，因而才有通貨膨脹。他說：「美國今天沒有物價管制，沒有配給制度，但仍然有大量的，大量的生產。」他說：「物價上漲，不是管制不管制的問題，是看政府能不能收縮信用！」</p>
<p>在參衆兩院的銀行專門委員會上，辯論經濟問題，非常激烈，也非常深刻。兩年以前，被共和黨議員認爲「眼中釘」的物價管制局長保羅彼脫，今夭又出現在許多帶有厭惡的共和黨議員面前。保羅彼脫仍然是那末鎭靜，這位帶有充份學者氣味的經濟專家，自從一九四六年物價管制局被取消以後，他仍然被杜魯門留在總統府裏，做杜魯門的經濟顧問。杜魯門的一套經濟管理理論，被共和黨議員們深惡痛絕的「警察國主義」的理論，有多半出諸保羅波脫之手。他這次仍然被杜魯門指定，作爲解釋有關經濟法案的代表，他是負責在國會解釋總統所提的經濟法案的。</p>
<p>和保羅波脫同時被邀在國會解釋的，還有財政部長史奈德聯邦準備銀行委負會主席麥開勃。財政部長認爲：他是一向反對物價管制的，但到緊急時期，也有必要，他認爲管制物價和收縮信用，都爲今日美國的當務之德。麥開勃則認爲：若完全期望於「收縮信用」，亦屬過份理想，他報吿今天美國的通貨。三倍於戰前，而生產量的總和，僅較戰前增加百分之九十，（不到兩倍），所以恢復戰時的消費者的信用管制，爲刻不容緩之舉。但假如人民都願意，能够稍稍限制一下國民的購買量，則對於物價，當大有好處。</p>
<p>但是，參議院銀行專門委員會主席韜倍，則大爲不然，他認爲限制消費，必然折殺生產。他說：解決美國的經濟問題，祗有增加生產，生產第一。他說：自由物價是最好的獎勵生產的方法，生產增加，物價自然會隨之下跌。他說杜魯門的經濟理論，是倒果爲因之談。</p>
<p>辯論到現在沒有結束，看樣子，杜魯門的十一條提案，必將是無結果而散。杜魯門在百忙中，召集了這麼一次「緊急特別會議」，如果就我們中國人眼光來看，今天美國的物價問題，眞是談不上半絲半毫的緊急。反對種族徧見，本來是一件好事，但也不是個緊急問題。美國陸軍參謀總長說；「美國陸軍，黑人與白人分編，有其一貫的優良傳統，陸軍當局，無意改爲混合編制。」南方參議員滿彭克，拿參謀總長的話引神出來，大大攻擊了杜魯門。密西西比的參議員史坦尼斯，在國會演講了兩小時半，分析南方黑白分別待遇的歷史根據。他說：如果杜魯門要用一道法律來造成南方的悲劇。那就無異於希特勒的做法。</p>
<p>當然，這也不是一個一朝一夕的緊急問題，其所以成爲「緊急」「特別」也者，都是爲了十一月大選的「政治手法」。塔虎脫在國會議事廳的走廊上，憤憤的說：「爲什麼要召集緊急會議，我眞找不出任何緊急的理由！」有位記者問：「是不是爲了柏林危機的緊急？」塔虎脫忽有所感，他把眼鏡一推，頭一仰，不禁笑了起來！</p>

<h3>千巒萬嶴話四明</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>浙江新設的一個四等縣　在六不管的山區中實現</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿日訊〕八月十一日，行政院政務會議通過浙江省增股四明縣治。從復員以後久懸未決的四明設治問題，終吿實現了。</p>
<p>四明縣位居浙東餘姚·上虞·慈谿·鄞縣·奉化·嵊縣等六縣之間，是一塊以四明山爲中心的山區地帶。設治的主要目的，是便於治安和行政管理。這個山區離各縣治較遠，而千巒萬嶴，交通不便，即在承平時代，也有盜匪出入。抗戰時，從「四一八」寗波淪陷後，這個區域便成爲游雜部隊的窩巢。勝利以後，匪　用它「六不管」的空隙，作爲流竄的根據地。浙江省政府有鑒於此，遂於卅四年冬的全省行政會議中決議設治，分電有關專員，實地察勘，擬具意見。卅五年九月，爲肅淸此邊區匪軍，設勦匪指揮部於梁衖，成立四明綏靖辦事處，一面積極進行設治。</p>
<p>新縣面積</p>
<p>根據省府的計劃，四明縣的地域，包括原屬餘姚的左溪，雅賢，曉雲，讓賢，白鹿，南嵐六鄕及梁衖鎭。原屬上虞的東和，下管兩鄕的各一部及大澤，岑南二鄕。原屬嵊縣的五聯，協和，二鄕。原屬奉化的剡民，剡後二鄉的大部。原屬慈谿的南山鄕及陸埠鎭，和車廐，大隱兩鄕之一部。和原屬鄞縣的杖錫，大皎，章密，龍鶴四鄕及罌湖，武陵，梅園，鄞章四鄕之一部。全縣共計廿七鄕鎭，二二〇保，二·八九四甲，三七·九四三戶，一五五·三一八人。面積一·〇七九·二二六方公里，平均每方公里一四四人弱。</p>
<p>山區四孔</p>
<p>四明山脈，來自天台，其主山爲石窗山，（又名鑊蓋山）在餘姚，奉化，嵊縣，上虞四縣舊交界處。因爲在石窗山的西南山腰上有一塊巨石，石中有四孔，形狀很像窗子，稱爲石窗，由窗得名，所以稱爲四明山。四明縣旣在山區，交通就大受影響，陸路交通以梁衖爲中心，北經油塌山，淸賢嶺，而達餘姚。東北經高地嶺，出龍坑，經南廟而達餘姚，（即餘梁公路）。西北經黄竹嶺而至上虞，（即餘百公路）。古道則以靑亭崗爲中心，可以四達，但是險　非常。水路交通僅可用竹筏，姚江上游源出本縣南部的羊額嶺，經梁衖八字橋至江口而成四明江。由江口分支的河流可通上虞城郊的通明壩，其正流則與姚江會合，經寗波至可以出海，有小輪船往來運輸。縣境内多屬山溪，僅可供輸送竹排，還談不到水運。省府有鑑於此，早就開闢餘梁，餘百（百官）二公路，但因限於經費，迄未完成。省府限令今年年底以前通車。此外，由於剿匪軍事的需要，省府擬以未來的新縣治—青亭崗爲中心，築公路四條，貫通整個山區，一自鄞縣的鄞江橋，經大皎，至靑亭崗。一自奉化經亭下或溪口，唐田而至靑亭崗，一自嵊縣經柏莊（即北偉）而至靑亭崗。現正由公路局進行中。</p>
<p>特殊物產</p>
<p>全縣旣屬山區，祗有東北部稍有平原，可耕田不足二十萬畝，僅佔總面積的八十分之一，所產米和雜糧，不足自給，南部的食糧更是缺乏。主要的產品是竹，木，柴，炭，土紙，茶和筍，山民全靠這山貨去交換少量的米和食糧，度着艱苦的生活。此外，樟密鄉的貝母，和桑蠶絲，大皎鄕的銀杏，算是特殊的物產了。商業要以姚南的梁衖爲最盛，是山區交易的中心點，其次爲大皎，下菅，章鎭三市，再次則爲山嶺村，中村。梁衖不僅商業最盛，而且人口最多，凡一千餘戶，是境內最大的市鎭。淪陷時期，一度爲「新四軍三五支隊所盤據，被稱爲「浙東的延安」。目前是四明山區的政治軍事的中心，被稱謂四明山的司令台，也將是四明臨時縣治的所在。</p>
<p>四明的經濟基礎旣是這樣薄弱，縣財政的困難可想而知，而它所負的責任—治安却又是這樣重大。目前爲了對付四五百名的股匪，有綏靖經費可供撥支，將來要維持這麼一個四等縣，非由省財政撥補不可了。</p>

<h3>臺灣林業全貌　危機中透露着一縷曙光</h3>
<p>— 波瀅</p>
<p>〔本報台南十八日航訊〕台灣的森林，幾乎遍佈全島，蒼翠鬱茂，蔚爲美觀，而台灣命名爲「Formosa」（原意即「美麗之島，」）其由來亦緣於此。而推究其森林發達之原因，約有下列數端：（一）台灣以海拔三千公尺左右的新高山服縱貫全島，而其支脈東西交錯，所以山多田少，樹木易於滋長。（二）台灣山勢陡絕，風害尤烈，需要鬱茂之森林，以固砂土，妨除風害。（三）因山地險峻，絕壑懸岸，人跡往來，尙感不便，木材搬運，更覺困難，森林之蓄積，遂得以保存。（四）台灣地理條件之優越，末島地跨溫熱兩帶，而就乘直氣候而言，因高山關係，擁有寒·暖·溫·熟·四帶之氣候。例如筆者此次視察西部諸林塲時，曾上阿里山，淸晨在嘉義登車時，猶爲酷熟的炎夏，而傍晚在山間却須烤火取暖了，阿里山海拔僅二二七五公尺，若更上三千公尺以上之玉山，自將更爲寒冷。且本島地處太平洋中，四面環海，濕潤適宜，植物旣易滋生，樹種亦甚豐富。更以日本領台五十年來，曾挾其林業先進國家之技術和經驗，投以巨資，積極經營，於是本島林業，乃斐然可觀，而爲台灣僅次於農業和工業的大事業矣。</p>
<p>伐林的惡風</p>
<p>在目前，臺　的森林，可以說是全國最大的森林區。森林的面積，據民國廿六年台灣林業統計爲一·八五九·現多爲富於風化性的黏板岩，苟無森林以保持水土，涵養水源，則每逢颱風暴雨，表土流失，沙石挾流而下，淹沒田園，潰決堤防，爲害不少。例如去歲台中羅東水災，即爲上流森林被砍伐殆盡的惡果。筆者此番在台灣，沿途隨處可見「森林是合灣的生命」，「沒有森林就沒有台灣」的標語，實際上，此確非過份的宣傳。</p>
<p>日人經營台灣林業，原極認眞，對於森林之保護和取締，亦甚注意，故很少有森林火災和濫伐盜伐的情事發生，尤肯以鉅額經費，投資造林事業，保持伐植平衡，頗臻理想經營之境。迨太平洋戰爭發生以後，因需材孔亟，乃實行大規模砍伐，而造林事業，亦陷於停頓，其後戰事失利，日人孤注一擲，以求勝利之心益切，而濫伐之風亦愈盛，迄今猶有不少已砍樹木，堆積山間，不及搬遝，而聽任雨打日晒，漸趨腐敗。光復以後，接收事務之辦理，旣未臻理想，而又因機構歸併，人事失調等牽制，故濫伐森林，放火燒山等現象，不惟未能予以制止，抑且變本加厲。當局雖三令五申，懸爲禁律，然皆無濟於事，蓋此種盜伐，並非二一個人砍伐一二株樹，而是有組織有計劃的行爲，有金錢勢力爲背景，曾有盜伐森林之主犯，被逮解送法院，不久即被保釋，可見其神通之廣大，此實爲今日台灣林業之最大障碍。</p>
<p>台灣林業行政，在日領時代，歸總督府農商局下之山林課掌握，組織内容，分庶務，林政，林產，林務四系，分堂全台之林業事務。光復以後，由長官公署農林處下林務局接收，今則改爲省政府農林處林產管理局，現更統一了林業管理機構和業務機構之職權，將山林管理所亦改隸林管局管轄。林管局之下，現有六個林塲，計爲阿里山林塲，八仙山林塲，太平山林塲，竹東林塲，巒大山林塲，太魯閣林塲。前三者規模較大，設備較齊，係承襲前日人官營伐木事業之較大者。筆者此次曾至西部之阿里山，八仙山，竹東，巒大山四個林塲觀光，茲就見聞所及，略述槪况如次：</p>
<p>阿里山五木</p>
<p>阿里山位於臺灣中部，為新高山脈西北之一支脈，處北緯二三·五度的北回歸綫上。東西八公里，南北二〇公里，面積一萬〇三十二公頃，海拔在九百二十四公尺至千八百公尺之間，因埀直氣候關係，擁有溫·暖·寒·熱·四帶樹種。木材蓄積量，計：針葉三七四·二三〇株，材積二·九五二·八三四立方公尺，闊葉一·一一二·一八六株，材積三·一二九·九七八立方公尺，爲數千年涵　生殖，未施斧伐之處女林。年代旣久，因之多產良材，例如名聞遐邇之阿里山五木：紅檜，華山松，鐵杉，合灣杉，扁柏，而其中檜木一種，尤爲世界木材之名藍，如著名之神木，即爲樹齡三千年，樹高五十三米，周圍三四·三米之紅檜，（學名：ChamaecyparisFormosensis　Msts.）（參看附圖）。其他合抱之木，不可勝數，胸高直徑寬及四·五米者，所在多有。日人以其材積豐美，故甚埀涎，而加以測量，査勘，計劃，開發，自明治三十一年至明治四十四年，共投下資本六百〇九萬日元之鉅，自嘉義市敷設運材鐵道長七十餘公里，盤桓迴旋於千山萬壑之中，蜿轉穿插於巉岩峭壁之上，由山麓至山巓，升高約二千三百公尺之海拔，全程計有五十餘山洞隧道，據林塲阿里山山上分塲主任張雨峰君吿筆者：其中最長一個，長度八百米，可以想見其工程之浩大與險阻。我們在山上高山博物館之側，見到日人琴仙河合博士之旌功碑，據聞即係紀念他當運材鐵道首次通車時，隨車視察，過隧道時探首巡視，而慘遭割首殉難者。此間之集材設備，因所採取者均爲大木，不能利用普通集材方法，於是日人乃採用美洲西部架空式鋼索運材方法，可將二千六百公尺半徑範圍以內之任何巨木，運集於鐵路附近之車站，以待火車之裝運，目下林塲仍沿用此項特種集材機，（參看附圖）唯以後器材之補充，殊成問題耳。</p>
<p>豐原八仙山</p>
<p>八仙山在台中之豐原，東西一五·七公里，南北一一·八公里，面積一六·四二二公頃，範圍較阿里山爲大，但木材總蓄積量僅有二·八五〇·八一五立方公尺。自豐原有運材鐵道約六十公里至佳保台，再上則賴糧車與索道以運送木材，　車爲較舊式之設備，且其上面之舊山，林木砍伐將盡，今年八月以後，該部份事業將吿結束。索道通至新山，爲方興未艾之伐木事業區，但索道的鋼索，以前是三個月換一次，今則已將一年朱換，故八仙山林塲孟傳樓塲長因鋼索陳舊，恐生意外，現禁止索道行駛客車，但員工因工作之需要，旣必須上下，故每冒險搭空車而上，騎木材而下，其危險實更甚，一旦索道發生意外，不但員工生命毫無保障，而且修復爲難，山上的木材是一根都無法下來了，所以如果這器材問題不得解決，不要說增加生產，恐怕不須好久就要陷入停工的危機。</p>
<p>竹東竹塲等</p>
<p>竹東林塲和巒大山林塲，規模較小而筆者亦未登山視察，但知竹東林塲掩有鹿塲山全地及香杉山，蒲羅灣，麻伊馬來，籐打那，水田各山地，面積共約一一·五三〇公頃，木材蓄積量約爲一百〇五萬立方公尺。唯其中面積最大，蓄積最富之鹿塲山，至今年四月始收歸直營，故一切尙在整理中，如設備充份，運諭工具增加，公路橋樑修整，則今後生產量當可逐漸增至每月一千四百立方公尺。巒大山林塲目下事業僅限於望鄉山，命名曰巒大山林塲，蓋寄希望於未來，以開發　大山之原生森林爲目標也。故目前林區總面積僅一百五十甲，作業林班只有一個，三十六年度砍伐原生林木總數量一三·〇〇〇立方公尺，運出木材數量八·二四八立方公尺，製材數量四·五三七立方公尺，三十七年度一月份至三月份砍伐原生林木總數量一·一三八立方公尺，運出木材數量一·七六八立方公尺，製材數量九七三立方公尺。</p>
<p>訪問後觀感</p>
<p>這次筆者有幾會來臺訪問這幾個國內罕見，遠東有數的林塲，並作實地的興察，殊感欣幸，同時獲得了不少的資料，知道日人對於林業建設之技術方面，實有不可磨滅的功績，足令吾人警惕。但其於戰時濫伐森林，放任人民焚林，燒山和破壞，致使我國家元氣，蒙受莫大損失，國土保安，發生莫大之影響，亦至可切齒憤恨，而更令人痛心者，厥爲光復以後，國人前來接辦而未能力謀發展，反使每况愈下，實深堪痛惜。目前不可諱言，台灣林業正面臨嚴重的危機，因爲濫伐盜伐，使附近林木幾已砍伐殆盡，再過幾年就完了，而目前只有採伐而不見造林，砍一株即少一株，同時相反地說，要談造林，必先保林，而保林之首要，即在如何减少和禁止濫伐與盜伐，而且造林的目的，並不在木材生產，它主要在保持水土，寒養水源，以及調節氣候，不過爲了要達到「以林養林」，不仰仗於外力，就非談到木材生產不可，所以唯有達到伐植平衡，林業才能立於永久不敗之地，但由於幾年來的斵害與目前情勢的限制，現在要談伐植平衡，恐尙言之過早。</p>
<p>其次，是運輸器材的匱乏，目前幾已到達山窮水盡的境地，除了上述八仙山索道的情形以外，例如阿里山鐵道的鐵軌，有許多已半邊磨光，橋樑山洞，多已腐壞，四十輛機車，只有六輛可用，而且都已有三十年以上歷史，在目前補充是根本談不到，就是想加以全部修復，亦無力負担這筆鉅大的費用，現在只好頭痛醫頭般的揀必須修復的地方，先行拼拼凑凑的修理，因此，影響運輸能力的銳减，使生產無法增加，促使林業的日趨沒落。</p>
<p>除此而外，再加上內地帶來的不良風氣，在台逐漸蔓延，例如人事糾紛之使林塲内部情形趨於複雜，因而影響公務的處理和行政的效率。如最近阿里山林塲塲長符賢，因不堪部屬掣肘，而一怒掛冠，即爲明顯之一例。（見八月二日台灣新生報消息。）</p>
<p>曙光的初現</p>
<p>目前林業雖確處於困難重重，前途黯　淡的困境中，但事在人爲，若能奮發努力，未始沒有希望，台灣林務機關諸負責人，有鑒及此，還能努力苦鬥，力挽頽局，使林業前途微露一絲曙光，洵爲難能可貴。而此間興論界對此關係台灣命脈的森林事業，亦皆能洞燭機先，及時呼籲，大足使人興奮，如筆者在八仙佳保台時，恰遇台北記者林務訪問團亦在山上，待筆者自南部觀光歸來時，台北報章已騰載林務訪問之報導文字，且類能切中時弊，揭露林業困難之癥結所在，但願由此喚起社會人士注意，而共謀困難的解決，恢復林業的繁榮，則不惟台灣六百萬人民將同沐其利，即爲國家百年大計着想，實亦爲當務之急。</p>

<h3>蘭市驚人血案　在逃兇手緝獲　王文選四昆仲　先後均被戳傷　死一傷二·情節離奇</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州十九日航訊〕本月八日深夜十一時許，在雨濛濛，街燈黯淡，蘭市左公東路二一二號，發生驚人兇殺血案，一死三傷，而兇手竟於事畢越垣逃逸，經刑警隊一週之多方跴拿，卒於十五日落網。茲誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>緣有山西人王文選，抗戰時在昆明空軍中充司機，結識一河南洛陽籍士兵尤守芳。王在滇緬路黄金時代中，薄有積蓄，遂自購卡車二輛，在西南行駛。其三弟王文義，四弟王文趙，均以駕馳汽車爲業。兩年前王文選舉家遷至西安，尤守芳是時亦被調赴陜，雙方感情始終融洽。最近王文選一家又來蘭經營運輸公司，尤守芳隨後來蘭，起初寄寓王家，本月初始遷往某旅舍住宿，本月八日晚十時許，尤守芳又至王家，與文選喝茶聊天。一小時後，王文選赴厠所小便，尤守芳突由後躍出，以修理汽車用之三角刮刀亂戳，文選大呼救命！其四弟文禮聞聲後出視，又被尤迎面一刀，適中左胸，亦倒地不起；三弟文義，二弟文忠先後撲救，均被戳傷。當夜十二時後，始由王文義之子年生呼警，警局急送傷者至附近醫院急救；至九日晨三時，王文禮因傷及心臟，不治身死；王文選被戳傷胸·背部七處，亦一度陷於昏迷，其餘二人，均有刀傷三五處不等，但尙未中要害，已無性命危險。</p>
<p>死者王文禮，原定本月十五日結婚，詎料飛來横禍，致　慘死，已於十一日安葬。但尤守芳行兇原因，各方頗多猜測，終不能揭破謎底。本市治安當局已令飭刑警隊，限於一星期內破案，一時偵騎四出，至十四日晚猶無所獲。</p>
<p>本月十五日下午三時，兇手尤守芳卒在延壽巷二十一號爲刑警隊逮捕；據云僅一秒之差，兇手即被遠颶。記者於當日下午七時，曾往刑發隊訪問此一「殺人魔王」，但尤守芳外表如一學生，著黄卡機布襯衣，面色黝黑，儀容整潔，僅神色沮喪而已，毫無兇狠之態。據渠在刑警隊所供行兇動機，是他與王文選在西安時，王囑託照料其妻胡奇珍，但王旋與一開藥房之陳姓女子往來頗密。王文選原擬圖謀陳女之藥房，逢與其妻胡奇珍離婚，並託其老上司鄭排附向尤守芳言明，將棄婦胡奇珍改嫁尤守芳。尤最初感於義氣，並未承當，但以後胡奇珍生活無着，遂由尤接濟，兩人無形中同居起來</p>
<p>今年初，王文選與陳姓女子感情破裂，藥房落空，遂回藥與胡奇珍往來，並相偕潛來蘭州。尤一氣之下，追踪來蘭，但亦未與王等鬧翻。尤守芳最近失業，生活拮据，曾一度寄宿王家汽車棚內，並央王氏昆仲代爲謀事，王家見尤落拓，一改過去之熱絡態度，尤遂憤而遷出。</p>
<p>王氏民仲旣未替尤謀事，更恐嚇他要把他投入井内；八日夜，尤守芳又爲謀事冒雨來王家，言語扞格，最後深覺王文選太沒良心，遂決意傷害王文選。一刀之後，王氏兄弟相繼出援，尤守芳恐與己不利，結果四人一律被戮。出事後，尤即黃夜潛逃出城，往皋蘭北鄕水阜河躲避，十五日始進城聽風，即被逮捕。現本案已由警局將人犯及兇器移解地方法院，日內即可依法提起公訴。</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>目的與手段　—為不擇手段者進一言—</h3>
<p>政治上的鬥爭，往往不是目的和自的間的鬥爭，而只是手段和手段間的鬥爭。政治上的勝利，也往往不是目的本身的勝利，而只是手段本身的勝利；「成者爲王，敗者爲賊」。這成或敗，決定某一人之爲王或爲賊，而某一人的目的，固不必志在爲賊也。是促使某一人成功或失敗的，多不在其目的，而常在其手段。以目的論，劉邦和項羽的目的未必不同，均可謂以反抗暴秦爲目的！至低限度，他們的口號是如此。然而劉邦成功，項羽失敗者，即因爲他們的手段不同。一則入關之後，鷄犬不騖，秋毫無犯；一則坑秦卒，焚咸陽。這手段上的仁或暴，加上手段上的智或愚，就是劉項成敗的主因。我國歷史上所有帝王以及其他政治鬥爭者的成敗史，都太半可作如是觀。這是歷史上最明顯的事實，用不着多說。</p>
<p>這種明顯的事實，所告訴我們的是什麽呢？我們能從這種事實而獲得什麽敎訓呢？第一種敎訓是，目的不能使手段成爲正當。目的的正當，不就是手段的正當，這是人所共知，絕無疑問的。以不正當的手段去達正當的目的，這正當的目的能使不正當的手段成爲正當嗎？這就是問題之所在。事實上，我們是常以不正當的手段去達正當的目的。我們常用欺騙的手段引誘小孩吃藥，也常用欺騙的手段去審問犯罪者，而使犯罪者吐實。對於爲着報父仇而殺人的人，我們是同情的。對於和敵人作戰而殺人，而欺詐的士兵，我們不惟同情，而且贊美。類似的行爲，不知多少。這豈不是目的正當，手段便隨之成爲正當嗎？自所謂「只顧目的，不擇手段」的主張者來說：這或者就是他們的理論根據。不過，這種理論根據是並不堅强的。一則，我們並不承認以上的事例是可爲常例的，也就是說，我們並不承認以上的手段是可以普遍應用的。我們只承認在某某特殊情况下，上述的手段是容許的。二則，在特殊情况下，我們雖容許上述的手段，然我們並不視上述手段爲正當。爲促使小孩吃藥，或促使犯罪者吐實，我們固容許運用欺騙手段，可是對於這種手段的本身，我們仍是加以斥責的。這種手段的本身，我們決不同情。我們所同情的，乃目的而非手段。法律並不允許爲報父仇而擅殺人，其理由在此。現代人對於戰爭本身曾視之爲非法，其理由亦在此。可見目的正當，其手段並不隨之而正當。這是在任何情况之下都是如此的。在任何情况下，目的都不能使手段成爲正當。不正當的手段始終是不正當的手段，不以和正當目的的關係而成爲正當。蓋行爲的正當或不正當是另有標準，不能僅以目的而加以決定。若僅以目的來決定行爲的正當與否，則不惟人類目的，潛伏難知，判斷不易，即知亦將使正當利不正當間的區別，根本消失。如盜竊目的在求生存，吾人不能謂「求生存」之爲目的不正當也。豈盜竊行爲也隨這目的而成爲正當嗎？果手段隨目的而成爲正當，則天下或將無不正當之手段。</p>
<p>第二種敎訓是，不正當的手段足以破壞正當的目的。目的不能使手段正當，然手段不正當時，則目的常受其影響。我們都知道目的是潛伏的，是潛伏在人類內心的深處的。現代科學所以排除「目的」這一概念，即因爲這一概念幽隱難明，不易經驗的緣故。我們判斷某一人的目的，決不能直接覺知其目的，只能經由其行爲，其手段，去測度其目的。這種測度當然可以錯誤，所以不正當的手段不一定就反映不正當的目的。不過，除了這種測度，這種推論的方法外，我們却沒有旁的方法可直接知道他人的目的。蓋語言文字上關於目的的表達，不必即爲某一人内心目的的表達。這是可以作偽的。反之，手段的運用，或行爲的表達，却較可反映某一人內心的目的。因而，某一人的手段不正當時，我們便懷疑其目的也不正當。這是很自然的，同時也是有根據的。是我們果有正當的目的，決不能運用不正當的手段，否則，我們的目的可容易被人誤認爲不正當，而我們也很難自行證明其爲正當。次則，不正當的手段有時固可實現正當的目的，然却常常破壞正當的目的。這樣的例證很多。譬如孝養父母，目的當然是正當。但若運用盜竊的手段，則通常必破壞這種目的。又如愛國，或增加國家民族的光榮，這目的更是我們所認爲正當的。在這種目的下，運用不正當的手段，又照例是我們所容許的。可是德日等國的獨裁者和軍閥所運用的欺詐和侵略的手段，不是破壞了他們的目的嗎？依目前的情勢看來，雖國與國間的交涉，亦不能運用不正當的手段以達其所謂正當的目的。欺詐侵略的行爲是終必白食其果的</p>
<p>第三種敎訓是，政治上唯能以手段爭取勝利，而難以目的爭取勝利。這並不是否認目的的重要性。政治上目的當然重要。我們當然需要有崇高而正當的目的。不過，政治上的鬥爭，很少是目的和目的間的鬥爭。至低限度，在表面上彼此所提出的目的是難得會衝突的。拿獨栽政治和民主政治來說，無疑是兩種極端相反的政治，然其區別決不在公開的目的上。自公開的目的言，獨裁者必自認其目的和民主政治相同，即以謀人民的福利爲目的。自然，我們可以否認獨裁者的目的不是如此，不過我們否認的根據，便以獨裁者所運用的手段爲根據。我們因獨裁者所運用的手段不民主，然後說他們的目的不民主。獨裁者以欺騙人民，壓迫人民爲手段時，我們便無法相信其所謂「謀人民福利」的目的。這樣，獨裁者的失敗，不管目的爲何，實際就是手段的失敗。所以英儒柏克氏（Ernest　Barker）認爲民主和獨裁的區別，主要在手段而不在目的。自由的民主政治，乃是「較注意政府的方法而不是其目的—較注意政府的歷程而不是其目標的。」普通認爲政治是玩手段的把戯。在某一意義上，這話是不錯的。但唯一的條件是，我們得玩正當的手段，而不能玩不正當的手段。玩不正當的手段，縱能獲取一時的勝利，終久是會失敗的。政治上的悲劇可設就是忽視手段的悲劇，忽視手段不必正當而只求目的正當的悲劇。</p>
<p>以上三種敎訓本來是很明顯的，作者所以特別在這裏提出來的理由，就是因爲目前我國從事政治活動的人們太過忽視手段。他們總是在所謂「只顧目的，不擇手段」的虛僞原則下去作政治上的鬥爭。他們的目的也許正當，然他們的手段則多不正當。爲達某一目的，他們可以和出賣國家民族利益的團體勾結，也可以和土匪强盜聯絡，可以和卑汚的政客或軍閥合作，一言以蔽之，什麼般最不正當的手段他們都　運　。他們似以實現民主爲目的，却運用了最不民主的手段。他們似以民衆福利爲目的，却僅以民衆爲工具，爲手段。他們忘記了德哲康德的名言——即「對待人類，無論如何，當視之爲目的，不能僅視之爲手段」的名言。這名言實際就是民主政治的要素。他們不知道，不擇手段，則民衆亦可成爲手段。一以民衆爲手段，他們即破壞了他們自身的目的，破壞了民主政治的精神。民主政治是決不容許僅以人民爲手段的。一切均可僅爲手段，惟有人類自身不能僅爲手段。僅以人類爲手段，其所謂目的，即無從說起。但「不擇手段」便無法不會僅以人類爲手段。這樣，一切罪惡便在「不探手段」的原則下做出來了。中國當前局勢的混亂，這些高談民主，而不擇手段的人們是應負責的。歷史的敎訓，不擇手段的人們是始終會失敗的。這是作者不能不一言以警醒他們的。</p>

<h3>證交復業　尚無確期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政經濟緊急處分令發布後，本市證交即遵令暫停營業，復業之期，尙待行政院正式指示。昨據證交某發言人觀瀾，大致期不在遠。又關於已做交易之交割問題，該所機要人員，昨日下午曾作縝密之研討，決定方案，待提供今日該所常務理事會席上通過後，即公吿施行。</p>
<h3>國行決定開放　全國各地匯兌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕幣制改制後，央行已決定開放全國各地匯兌，僅東北一區因遊資太多，尙在另籌方案中。內匯匯率及存放款利率，亦決定加以調整，將根據各地物價水準，逐步予以抑低，以期短期全閱各地之物價，能　於一致。</p>

<p>公債</p>
<p>昨塲外有數十萬之小交易做開，均以金圓券爲單位，內計統丙當日交割者，自一元升至一元五結束，隔天下週一交割，須一元六角半左右。甲乙丁戊則均屬下週一交割，計甲乙爲一元四，丁種一元四角半，戊種一元半有零，均較前日再升半成左右。</p>
<h3>國行今照常辦公</h3>

<p>新經濟辦法實施後，輸出入管理問題，頗受影響。頃悉：輸管辦法決加修正，輸管會各主管部門，正根據財政經濟緊急處令，詳加研討。如有與緊急處分令有抵觸者，該會即予修正，俟各主管修正意見彙齊後，再成一整個新方案。故該會過去所有法令規章，此次均重加檢討，俾能配合新措施，顧及事實，推行順利，決不使將來有任何問題發生。該會各主腦，昨日午前曾舉行會議，交換意見。據悉：依據緊急處分令條文規定，五六兩季仍照舊辦理。自第七季起，進口限額核减四分之一。附表（一）（三），則開放自備外匯准其輸入，故該會之條正部份，側重附表（一）（三）兩類，俟修正條文整理就緒後，當呈政院核示。預計需時兩週，始能解決。在此過渡期間，該會之處理原則，為（一）與緊急令無抵觸者，照舊辦理。（二）與緊急令有抵觸者，俟政院核定後再行辦理。又僑資投資辦法，因經濟新方案之實施，亦應加以補充修正，短期內尙難公布。</p>
<h3>庫劵暫停發售</h3>

<h3>國行收兌外幣　可開專戶存儲</h3>
<p>須經許可始能購進物資</p>
<p>金圓劵明日開始流通市面，舊幣同時收兌，中央銀行暫不委托其他行莊代辦。收兌之外幣，如願輸入物資者，可開立專戶亦儲，但須有許可證始能抵用，否則仍祗照規定兌換金圓劵。</p>
<h3>川物價續漲</h3>
<p>〔本報成都廿一日電〕蓉市塲仍未開放，物價廿，廿一日兩日均瘋狂猛漲，尤以一般生活品爲最巨，平均漲達兩倍。布疋棉紗百貨各業均休業三日，米雙石五四〇〇萬，各貨無交易。據權威觀察，川物價將漲與京滬看齊，即吿穩定。</p>
<h3>呢絨交易停頓</h3>
<p>前日週五呢羢躉批交易，諸大批發戶及棋盤街茶會上俱暫告停頓。同業多數人預測，市面勢必賡續下降，逆料銀根近旬日内必趨緊張，負有高利貸者，勢必被迫而將貨物斬出云。</p>
<h3>國家行局核減利率　放款月息最高不超過三分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲减低國家行局利率起見，特於昨日午後，召開國家行局庫負責人員會議。由兪鴻鈞親自主持，徐柏園。劉攻芸·宋漢章·李叔明·席德懋·錢新之·趙棣華·程遠帆·壽勉成·等均參加，當經議決調整各項利率如下：</p>
<p>（一）國行日拆利率二分一厘。</p>
<p>（二）國家行局庫放款利率，月息最高不得超過二分。</p>
<p>（三）國行轉抵押重貼現，月息爲二分四厘。</p>
<p>（四）同業存款（包括存款準備金）及國家行局庫存款利率，定爲月息二分。</p>
<p>（五）關於商業行莊之存放利率，議決由財部督促，逐漸依照國家行局之利率方針辦理，原有之利率管制條例緩予執行，即央行暫不核定商業行莊之利率。</p>
<h3>商業行荘　提出要求</h3>
<p>國家行局負責人會議於傍晚六時結束後，兪鴻鈞隨即召集商業行莊負責人開會，兪氏當塲宣布國家行局核减利率之結果，隨即進行討論。</p>
<p>銀行公會理事長李銘當時陳述意見，希望商業行莊之利率能逐漸减低，使與國家行局相接近，但盼當局執行此政策時，須顧到行莊之日常開支，同時如放款利率過低，申請貸款者將使行莊無法應付。</p>
<p>討論結果，商業行莊代表提出下列各項要求：（一）存款準備金以後得以美金公債繳納。（二）存款準備金之比例應予减低，因幣制改革以後，籌碼之數額已大爲减少。（三）商業行莊在必要時，國行應予以各種協助。（四）行莊承兌之國行餘額，請於今日（廿二日）折合成金圓劵，以便應付明日週一顧客之需要。</p>
<p>以上各項要求，除（一）（二）兩點需由徐次長柏園携京向財部請示外，其餘均經兪總裁面允。會議隨即於七時許結束。</p>

<h3>世運籃球隊　敗於菲島記</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者鍾</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕我國世運籃球隊，作戰迄今，三戰二勝。今日（八月四日）下午七時，在哈林蓋健身房對菲島一戰，實爲吾軍生死關鍵，但終因連日交戰，諸隊員體力不支，演出動作，竟吿失常，結果以卅七對五十一爲菲島隊擊敗。昨前二日，苦戰之功，盡付東流，令人痛惜。前來捧塲之吾國觀衆甚衆，吾國在英實習之海軍學生，復組織啦啦隊，到塲助威，盛况空前。比賽經過錄次：</p>
<p>（于瑞章）　黄天錫</p>
<p>吳成章（賈志軍）（李震中）</p>
<p>李世僑蔡文華包松圓</p>
<h3>菲島戰術　全部美國作風</h3>
<p>菲島隊因此塲比賽，對該隊亦是生死戰，听以一開球後，即傾全力進攻，瞬眼間擲進一球，以二對〇佔先。二衛在嚴厲監視下，行動稍形粗魯，數次在吾軍投籃時，犯規累累，但吾軍諸球員，今日不知何故，在四次罰球中祗進一球，實爲失敗最大之癥結。以後全塲盡爲菲島隊所控制，吾軍無力還抗。菲島此次盼術，全部效美國作風，以極短之派司，迅速傳遞，非至有八九分把握時，決不射籃。其中鋒按術高明，球一到彼手，必進無疑。加之二衛，蹤躍頗高，釘人極緊，故演出確非常精彩。頃刻即以十比四領先，吾軍雖亦全力反抗，但終不能領先。包松圓此塲打來賣力異常，惜蔡文華不知何故，投籃三次，竟吿不中，良機全失。雖會一度十比八接近，但頃刻間即被菲島以神出鬼沒之姿態，速進三球，以十六比八遙遙領前。以後所戰，吾軍僅能在罰球中獲得數分，上半時二十七比十四，相差十三分之多。休息時觀衆預測，中華隊大勢已去，今日當必敗無疑。</p>
<h3>大勢已去　前功盡付東流</h3>
<p>下半時宋指導調李震中代包松圓進塲，開球後，李世僑即以單槍匹馬，躍起單手擲入，姿勢美滿萬分，獲得觀衆不少掌聲。以後吾軍雖獲球機會頗多，但多在菲島隊步步緊釘之下，使吾前鋒一籌莫展。相反該隊以從容必進之射籃術，又以三十一對十七遙逼佔先。此時蔡文華疲態畢露，即遣賈志軍換入，其間又以于瑞章調吳成章，局勢更成一面倒，成三十九比二十三。是時離終局僅十分鐘，敎練即以開塲時原班人馬調入，以作孤注一擲，菲島隊此時亦知吾方之戰略，奮力抵禦，雙方戰來精彩萬分，但終以實力相去懸殊，加之隊員氣力益見不支，在四十一比二十五，四十七比二十七步步緊逼之下，使吾軍一蹶不振。雖有吳成章進數球，亦屬徒然，終以五十一對三十二，菲島擊敗中華隊。</p>
<p>在此戰局中，正可看到遙射長遞，在目前新式之戰術中，已不復琉行，中華隊目前在世運中得此經驗後，日後當可改善。但我國體力的不支，實爲屢次失敗之最大原因。此次吾國籃球隊能在盡最大努力之下，獲勝數次，已屬難能可貴。</p>
<h3>我世運足球隊　六比一克暹隊</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷廿日電〕我世運足球隊本日以六比一擊敗暹羅選手隊，我隊黎兆榮以足踢與頭頂功夫，一人獨進四球。朱永强與張金海，各進一球。</p>

<h3>朱自清先生之死（上）</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>自從八月八號在報上看到朱自淸先生住北　醫院治胃潰瘍病的消息以後，我便想去探視，後來因爲自己也在病中，同時我想他正在病重的時候，我不應該去擾亂他，我知道醫院往往是拒絕親屬以外的人去探視一個患重病的人的。誰知這想法錯了，從此我永遠沒有機會再見到自淸先生了！</p>
<p>用不着介紹，凡是在中學的國文課本上，讀過自淸先生「背影」的人，都知道自淸先生的文章是怎樣地流利，輕鬆，而含意深刻。他從民國十三年出版「踪跡」到今天，整整地爲文藝工作了二十六個年頭，如果從他開始從事寫作時算起，已有三十年以上的歷史，他是一個這樣對學術認眞研究，對靑年諄諄等誘的一位作家。他從十四年八月到清華大學當敎授，到今年整整地二十三年，凡是受過他敎育的人，都知道他的特殊性格：不論敎書，改卷，都非常認眞，一點也不馬虎。從來上課不遲到早退，而且每堂點名，雖然他這麼嚴，但沒有學生討厭他或者怨恨他的。原因是他在莊嚴中帶着和藹，誠懇，因此很使靑年感動。</p>
<p>自淸先生的別號是佩弦，用過的筆名有「知白」，「白暉」，「白水」。淸光緒戊戍年（一八九八）陰曆十月初九日，生於江蘇的江都，祖籍原是浙江紹興。民國九年，畢業於國立北京大學文科哲學門。是年八月，任杭州浙江省立第一師範學校國文敎員；民國九年八月至九月，任揚州江蘇省立第八中學國文敎員；民國十年二月至七月，任臺州浙江省立第六師範學校國文敎員；民國十年九月至十月，任吳淞中國公學中學部國文敎員；民國十一年七月至十三年一月，任溫州浙江省立第六師範學校曁第十中學國文敎員；民國十三年二月至十四年七月，任寗波浙江省立第四中學校國文敎員兼上虞白馬湖春暉中學國文敎員；民國十四年八月至今，任淸華大學國文系敎授。（編者按：佩弦先生爲淸華中國文學系主任。）</p>
<p>至於他的作品，已出版的有下列十五種：</p>
<p>（一）踪跡（詩與散文）　十三年十二月出版。</p>
<p>（二）背影（散文）十七年十月開明出版。</p>
<p>（三）歐遊雜記（遊記）廿三年九月出版。</p>
<p>（四）你我（散文）廿五年三月商務出版。</p>
<p>（五）倫敦雜記（遊記）三十二年四月出版。</p>
<p>（六）精讀指導舉隅（論文）三十年二月出版。</p>
<p>（七）詩言志辨研究（諭文）三十六年八月開明出版</p>
<p>（八）新詩雜話（批評）三十六年十二月作家書店出版。</p>
<p>（九）標準與尺度（批評）三十七年四月出版。</p>
<p>（十）語文零拾（書評與譯文）三十七年四月出版</p>
<p>（十一）論雅俗共賞（批評）三十七年五月出版。</p>
<p>（十二）語文影響及其他（論文）三十七年正中出版。</p>
<p>（十三）經典常談（論文）三十一年八月出版（與葉紹鈞合編）。</p>
<p>（十四）略讀指導舉隅（論文）三十二年一月商務出版（與葉紹鈞合編）</p>
<p>（十五）國文敎學（論文）三十四年四月開明出版（與葉紹鈞合編）。</p>
<p>至於散見全國各報紙雜誌上的論文小品，更不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>自淸先生最早曾加人過少年中國學會，文學研究會，對於新文學，有極大的貢獻，最近六七年來，他因爲看到抗戰以來一般大中學校的學生國文程度普遍降低，所以他致力於語文學的硏究，指導靑年走上文學之路。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，他在西南聯大，除了敎學外，還在民國三十年的時候和聯大師範學院幾位先生，創辦國文週刋，由開明書局印行，復員後，改由開明出版，仍爲自淸先生主編。本年他除了替開明編高中國文讀本外，還編好了聞一多全集，可惜書還未出版，而自淸先生已永離人間。</p>
<h3>向日本索還　文溯閣藏書</h3>
<p>— 周庭梧</p>
<p>日本於「九一八」「八一三」二次侵華事變期間，除擄掠物資外，復刦掠我國固有文物綦衆。勝利以還，經我國駐日代表團開列淸單，提示盟總，向日本追還。今已見載諸報章，得知下落，及已經追還者，有銅元，寒山寺銅鐘，永利碱廠機械等，但査民國廿年九一八事變時，日本曾將存於奉天行宮文溯閣内之四庫全書原鈔本亦刦掠而去，迄今猶未見提及。願我國駐日代表團，向盟總提出要求，澈査下落，俾中華文物，仍金甌無缺，而完璧歸趙也。</p>
<h3>賊智</h3>
<p>— 翼雲</p>
<p>盜竊之風，近以生活日迫而益甚，日前本報載漢口飛機，裝來竊犯一批，竊犯而乘飛機，可稱闊極，而其騙竊鋼筆，當面掉包，能使共同包紮之店夥，絲毫不覺，其手段自甚敏妙。回憶曩歲在滬，有某君被竊金錶，其經過情形，亦甚離奇，爲述如次。</p>
<p>某君家居南市，每日恒至市北應酬，歸必以夜，一夕車夫乞假，以附電車以歸，時車中已無空坐，身立車廂，左右前後，包圍數人，故意推擠。某固老於出外者，知所佩金錶，其鍊微露，諒爲彼等覬覦，即目注此錶，不稍他顧，看其如何下手。少時，擁擠更甚，不堪其擾，爰即下車，見有一人隨之同下。嗣又一電車至，車中座客較稀，某即躍登，而隨者亦跟蹤而上，某心竊笑，以爲此人如屬竊賊，無乃太笨，知有防範，而猶徒費工夫。未幾，至應換乘他路電車之處，某再下車，其人仍復同下，緊緊跟隨。某忽轉念，以爲滬上決無如此笨賊，惟是時暗殺之風甚熾，得無被誤認爲暗殺目標耶？躊躇至此，不覺大懼，尤不敢換乖人力車，以時已夜深，路人稀少，人力車頗感勢孤故也。適電車又至，立即趨上，隨者亦仍舊跟上，某心益恐，宛如死神已臨身旁。幸電車所至，已離家密邇，立即躍下，隨者亦繼之躍下，某即直奔弄中，滿擬此弄一渦，不數武即可到家矣。不料身甫入弄，隨者亦追入弄中，並在後追呼，謂有要事面商，囑其稍待。某此時魂飛天外，雖欲奔避，已不敢行，蓋恐一奔而彈自後發，又將如何！只得戰競待命。詎事出意料，隨者至前，即自稱係一扒竊，奉師命竊取其錶，然以有備，無法下手，惟師規極嚴，空手而返，必被撻楚不堪，只有自願備價，商購此錶，俾可返命。詞甚哀楚，並手呈鈔票，乞憐萬狀。某頗爲心動，惟慮鈔票或屬膺鼎，適弄口烟紙舖尙未打烊，乃特鈔請舖夥鑒定，紙紙皆眞，某即按錶之原價，受其鈔而以錶與之。扒竊持錶逕去，某亦復返弄中，心中旣無恐怖，並覺此事甚趣，且此錶所購之某公司，現正廉價八折，以化鈔再購同式之新錶，尙有餘鈔二成。一路尋思，已至家門，扣關而入，即與家人叙述所遇，意氣揚揚。顧述至受鈔付錶之際，探手衣袋，欲將原鈔持示家人，乃竟渺不可得，徧索身上，亦皆無有，連呼奇異，及一回思，始悟於受鈔入弄時，忽有人從弄中匆匆而出，微挨其身，當時方以扒竊已得錶而去，毫無疑慮，詎料賊極奸狡，竟使其同類乖其不備，竊鈔以去矣。</p>
<h3>度量衡</h3>
<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>各國有各國的度量衡，各地也有各地的度量衡，儘管已有所謂萬國十進制的度量衡局，用白金做成標準尺度放在那裏做標準，可是各國和各地仍不免各行其舊，這也如同國界省界縣界的關念一樣，人們不願意更改以往的習慣。</p>
<p>折算度量衡也頗費腦力，往往彼此在大數上相差不多，但在小數上却多到七八位尾數仍未能折合恰當。至於在市塲上，慷慨者和節儉者也常因一寸一兩的差異而發生爭執，結果呢，肯讓一寸一兩的人是白白讓了，不肯讓一寸一兩的人到底還是不讓。</p>
<p>爲了想使自已佔便宜，許多少都喜歡自已專用一個認爲準確的度量衡，以免因他人所用的度量不準而吃虧，結果是彼此都不準，爭執依然是不免。</p>
<p>如果大家相見以誠，禮讓爲先，又何必用什麽度量衡？反之，雖用了亦不見得就解決了問題。所謂剖斗折衡而民不爭的理論，其難以實行的癥結在此。</p>
<h3>垃圾</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>以垃圾之微，本不値得浪費墨水與稿箋，旦按諸咱們民情，「各人自打門前雪」已很難能可貴，至於公共街道上的汚物垃圾，大家早已司空見慣了。</p>
<p>因此，每天我行經溧陽路九百卅弄口的時候，雖然極感不適，也都掩鼻而過，以爲衛生局發現了，必定派員淸理，又以爲這偌大弄堂中，必有「好事」而愛淸潔之徒，會函請衛生局處理的。</p>
<p>但是不然。一個多月了，非但絕無「閒人」加以過問，而且愈積愈高，滿坑滿谷，除垃圾箱已全被掩沒之外，且擴展其佔領地縱横的一方丈，垃圾之上，每天且有新鮮的西瓜皮香蕉皮累累，爲金黄色大蒼蠅造福不淺，吾不知弄堂諸公於吃飽西瓜之後，步出弄堂，路過垃圾山畔之際，也會作嘔否？</p>
<p>去年，英文大美晚報第一版上曾刊過一張大照片，即某處之垃圾，標題日：「上海垃圾問題」，隨後當局曾經注意過垃圾的淸除，但是「日久玩生」，到如今，雖然時値夏令，除少數高貴住宅區外，可謂垃圾處處准。衛生局日前曾發表本年夏季以來本市已噴射ＤＤＴ多少噸，難道各處垃圾都已遍射了ＤＤＴ，故不予淸除，也無大碍？</p>
<p>一個上海的外籍居民說的好：「這情形要是在歐美，人民必羣起質問政府：我們的稅納到什麽地方去了？」</p>
<h3>靜坐經驗談（五）</h3>
<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>還有要補充一說的：靜坐一定是消極的休息知覺。運動神經，和積極的鍜鍊交感神經，兩種工夫，要同時併舉。這在人體構造上，有極重要的關係，是萬萬不容忽視的。如上文我所說的各項經騐，其中若頭部神經　動，腿部忽然顫動，口腔生出津液等，這皆是靜腦和深細呼吸併行時，才發生的。我相信只行一種，一定不會這樣，雖然我還沒有實騐過。至於何以靜坐後，能有這幾樣特殊異狀？（如上文所說）究應如何解釋？那就不能不淸教生理學專家，我却不敢隨便亂說了。</p>
<p>我有三點希望</p>
<p>最後我要提出三點希望來。</p>
<p>（一）希望能把這種有效的健身法，廣大的，普遍的宣傳出去，提倡起來，使人人皆瞭解，人人皆願習；尤其是平日職務較繁，而工作用腦多的人們，希望他每天能留出一小時或五十分鐘，來從事靜坐。如此，不但健康可以保持，同時工作效能，也可以特別增加。</p>
<p>（二）希望多數人能明確認定，這靜坐法是一種極平常的健身術，絕對不含有什麼神秘的意味，儘可公開學習，公開研究。什麽求仙成佛一派的玄妙說法，暫時可不必去加以理會</p>
<p>（三）這種靜坐法，旣可以用科學來解釋，自不妨進一步用科學實騐法來硏究。我希望有生理學家，心理學家，醫學家三種人聯合起來，做一個較長期有計劃的實騐。假定三方各有三位，九個人用同一方法，同一時間去坐，各人詳細記載其經歷，按時各人拿出資料來，共同證騐，共同討論，再精細一點，每次的坐前坐後，或每一月的始終，各人檢査脈搏，血壓，肺量，心臟動作，以及血的情况等等，做一個比較，如此做了一年兩年，我相信一定會有正確的結論得出來。（民國三廿七年八月十二日作於滬寓補學齋。全文完）</p>

<h3>Presidential Telegram to Provincial and Municipal Governments: Strictly Punish Speculation and Hoarding; No Tolerance for Neglect of Duty</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek summoned Premier Weng Wenhao to his official residence for breakfast on the morning of the 21st. He inquired about the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures promulgated and gave instructions. Premier Weng briefed the President on the situation as of the 21st and then departed. Premier Weng returned to the Executive Yuan, where he met with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu to inquire about everything, with particular attention to the suspension of production loans.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] In order to thoroughly implement the emergency financial and economic measures, the President telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments on the 21st, informing them of the government's determination to reform the currency system and stabilize the economy. He sternly instructed all levels of local government to fulfill their responsibilities and enforce the law. Any neglect of duty would be severely punished by the Central Government without any leniency. The full text of the telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Chairmen of all Provincial Governments and Mayors of all Municipal Governments: The Central Government, based on the provisions of the Provisional Articles of the Period of Mobilization and War, promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures and related regulations on the 19th of this month, which have been implemented throughout the country. This is a necessary measure to reform the currency system and stabilize the economy, the result of long-term, confidential research, carefully formulated to address the pressing needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood. Its main points should be explicitly stated: First, the issuance of the new currency, the Gold Yuan, is based on full reserves and public issuance, to permanently establish the credit of the new currency system. Second, the handling of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange assets held by the people aims to channel frozen, useless assets into legitimate industrial and commercial uses, while fully safeguarding the inherent interests of the people, without any loss whatsoever. Third, the measures to reorganize finances and strengthen economic controls are intended to actively promote balanced revenues and expenditures, stable prices, and increased production, while strictly cracking down on speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and other undesirable phenomena. It is believed that the full implementation of these measures will not only alleviate the hardships of the people but also lay the fiscal foundation for the great cause of the nation. All levels of government and the people of the entire country must be of one mind and cooperate fully to achieve the best possible results from these significant measures as quickly as possible. In particular, all levels of local government bear the responsibility for implementation and must earnestly inform the people that those who faithfully abide by the law and work together to promote the new currency system and economic stability will be fully protected by the government. Those who engage in speculation and hoarding, refuse to repent, and dare to violate the law for selfish gain are severing themselves from the nation and the people, no different from aiding traitors and bandits. Their crimes are equivalent to those of national traitors and collaborators. Regardless of the power or status they may wield, all levels of local government must act decisively, enforce the law, and severely punish them without any leniency. It is hoped that all levels of government will appreciate the needs of the time, be mindful of their responsibilities, establish achievements with determination, and break through obstacles with strength. No matter what difficulties are encountered, the Central Government will fully support them. However, if there is superficial compliance, neglect of duty, leading to a failure to implement the law, or inadequate supervision and evaluation of subordinate personnel, leading to illegal and corrupt practices that undermine the effectiveness of the law, then the responsible supervisors at all levels shall be held accountable for dereliction of duty, and the Central Government will severely punish them without any leniency. It must be understood that the Central Government's currency reform, financial reorganization, and economic controls are crucial to the prosperity and survival of the entire nation. With the wealth of our national resources and the abundance of our land, if the government personnel at all levels can recognize the spirit of the law, embrace a firm belief, proceed with the greatest determination, set an example, and strive for achievements, then the success of the new currency system and the new economy can be achieved in the shortest possible time, demonstrating the clear effect of self-reliance. Let each strive for this. Chiang Kai-shek, personally initiated.</p>
<h3>Economic Control Commission Immediately Established; Supervisors for Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan has established an Economic Control Commission to promote various measures for stabilizing the economy. The Premier of the Executive Yuan will concurrently serve as the Chairman of the Commission, and the members will include relevant individuals: Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Lisheng, Yan Jiagan, and Chiang Ching-kuo. The Commission's organizational regulations were approved at the Provisional Political Affairs Conference on the 19th, and the Commission will be formally established and hold a meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The President issued the following orders on August 21st: (1) Appoints Yu Hongjun as the Economic Control Supervisor for the Shanghai Region, with Chiang Ching-kuo assisting in the supervision. (2) Appoints Zhang Lisheng as the Economic Control Supervisor for the Tianjin Region, with Gong Fuzhou assisting in the supervision. (3) Appoints Soong Tzu-wen as the Economic Control Supervisor for the Guangzhou Region, with Huo Baoshu assisting in the supervision.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] To strictly implement the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the President has ordered the permanent stationing of supervisors in the Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin regions, so that relevant agencies in various localities can easily report to them. Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan telegraphed the leading military and political figures responsible for the aforementioned regions, Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Fu Zuoyi, Du Jianshi, and the provincial and municipal governments, to explain the matter.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] Premier Weng telegraphed Soong Tzu-wen, Yu Hongjun, and Chiang Ching-kuo on the 21st, encouraging them in their new tasks of supervising the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures in the Guangzhou and Shanghai regions. The full text of the telegrams is as follows:</p>
<p>To Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo:</p>
<p>To Yu Hongjun in Shanghai, and relayed to Chiang Ching-kuo: The implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures is of utmost importance, and the Shanghai region is particularly critical as the nation's hub. I hope that you both will supervise the effective implementation in all aspects of finance and materials, in order to achieve the practical results of consolidating currency credibility and stabilizing prices. You should also establish close ties with local agencies and security organizations to jointly plan for progress. I also hope that you will report the actual situation to the Executive Yuan at any time for review.</p>
<p>To Chairman Soong:</p>
<p>To Chairman Soong Tzu-wen in Guangzhou: The implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures is of utmost importance. It is particularly important to handle matters properly in the major coastal ports. I hope that you, as the supervisor of the Guangzhou region, will adapt to local conditions and carefully plan for implementation in all matters within the region. This is what I deeply hope for.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Telegrams Provinces and Municipalities: Diligently Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] In response to price fluctuations in some areas in recent days, the Executive Yuan telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments, urging them to strictly enforce the provision that local market prices as of August 19th must be the highest prices from now on.</p>
<h3>Accelerate the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises; Issue Stocks Using Marketable Securities</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] After the currency reform, the government will accelerate the sale of state-owned enterprises to replenish its issuance reserves. However, it will use marketable securities methods, issuing stocks. For example, the China Textile Corporation is estimated to be able to issue US$300 million worth of stock. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, except for a portion retained by the government, will also be sold through stock methods, which is expected to generate approximately US$100 million. The issuance of these stocks is expected to be realized in the short term. The revenue from the sale of stocks can be used as part of the government's guaranteed reserves for the issuance of Gold Yuan notes. There are other enterprises or materials to be sold, and their total value should be sufficient to serve as a full basis for guaranteed reserves. This reporter interviewed a well-connected, authoritative government source on the evening of the 21st. According to his remarks, there is indeed a fact that the issuance of Gold Yuan notes is worthy of our trust. Although some people are concerned about the high military spending, the US$125 million in dedicated military aid to China will not affect the stability of the currency system's revenue and expenditure. The authoritative source also praised the peg exchange rate with optimism, believing that it will certainly be achieved. Any deliberate violation of the law should be severely punished without any leniency. The full text of the telegram is as follows: To the Provincial and Municipal Governments: It is assumed that the telegram from Nanjing on August 19th has been complied with. The various measures stipulated in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures must be communicated and strictly implemented, and uniformly followed. Since inflation has been stopped, the economic situation can naturally be stabilized. The measures to strengthen economic controls contain clear provisions for stabilizing prices, and special attention should be paid to the prices of essential daily necessities. You are instructed to order the responsible agencies and personnel to widely inform the public and conduct earnest inspections to achieve the practical effect of stabilization. Executive Yuan, August 21st.</p>
<h3>Technical Issues After Currency Reform; Banking and Money Industries in Nanjing Resolve Five Points</h3>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The Nanjing Banking and Money Industries Association held a meeting on the morning of the 21st to discuss several technical issues in the implementation of the government's currency reform. Cheng Juemin, the general manager of the Bank of Communications Nanjing Branch, chaired the meeting, and Li Jialong, the person in charge of the Central Bank in Nanjing, also participated. Five resolutions were made, as follows: (1) After the resumption of business by various banks and firms on the 23rd, in order to meet the needs of opening, those with deposits below 10 billion yuan in the Central Bank may withdraw one-third.

(2) The interest rates for deposits and loans in various banks and firms will be decided after consultation at a meeting convened by the Central Bank in Shanghai. (3) Before the issuance of orders to suspend, commercial banks and firms will temporarily not handle credit loans. (4) When national banks and firms suspend loans, please notify the Banking and Money Industries Association in advance. (5) From the 23rd, payment accounts of various banks and firms will be calculated in Gold Yuan units. Income will be converted from legal tender to Gold Yuan, and expenditures will be entirely in Gold Yuan.</p>
<h3>Gu Zheng-gang Hopes Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Will Cooperate in Implementing the New Currency System; The Ministry of Social Affairs Will Not Draft Separate Wage Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the wage issue, this reporter interviewed Gu Zheng-gang, Minister of Social Affairs, on the 21st, inquiring about the Ministry's measures and the reactions from various localities since their implementation. Gu said that the workers' reactions had been good based on reports from various localities in the past two days. He also said that the workers could understand that stability in the rear made it easier for the front lines to proceed quickly. As for the implementation measures related to wages, the Ministry of Social Affairs will not draft separate regulations. Gu also specifically pointed out that banking and money industries in Shanghai must do their best to help, as this would be of great benefit to the country in the implementation of the new currency system. Gu will take a night train to Shanghai on the 21st to attend the establishment ceremony of the Industry Association and discuss matters with relevant figures in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Social Affairs has issued instructions to the social administration agencies in all provinces and municipalities to strictly enforce the relevant provisions of these measures on wage and prohibiting lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns, and that credit cooperatives should not engage in other banking and money industries. It has also ordered them to list and report to the Ministry the cost of living index for the first half of August in each locality and the wages of workers in various industries and categories for the first half of August in each locality, converted from legal tender to Gold Yuan according to the original regulations for each enterprise, as a basis for future assessment of wages in various localities. It is also learned that the Ministry has successively received telegrams from important groups in various localities expressing their excitement about this new government measure and their willingness to work hard in their respective positions to implement it. The Ministry of Social Affairs' telegram to the social affairs bureaus in all provinces and municipalities is as follows: "Since the government implemented the suppression of the rebellion, labor unions, industrial and commercial groups at all levels, and their members have been able to faithfully follow all government measures and have made many contributions, which is deeply gratifying. Now that the government has promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, Article 23 of Section 4 on Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls, which prohibits lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns during the implementation period of these measures, is of great importance for stabilizing the production process and increasing the strength to suppress the rebellion. A special telegram is sent to urge both labor and management to understand the difficulties of the time, faithfully comply, strictly prevent the instigation of bandits and traitors, and never give them an opportunity. Pay close attention at all times and in all places. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<h3>Prices of State-Owned Enterprises' Products Must Not Be Increased by Discount; Electricity Price Adjustments Must Be Approved Before Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] The Resources Commission telegraphed its affiliated state-owned enterprises to strictly comply with the newly promulgated measures. The sale prices of products from these units should be strictly in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the "Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls," which stipulate that prices should be converted from the local prices on August 19, 1937, to Gold Yuan according to the statutory exchange rate, and absolutely must not be increased. Any violation will result in the dismissal of the responsible supervisor and severe punishment according to law. In addition, the power plants affiliated with the Commission are state-owned public utilities. According to Article 3 of the aforementioned measures, if their fees are lower than the pre-war standard, they may be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard in order to achieve self-sufficiency. The Commission has also telegraphed all power plants that if it is necessary to adjust with reference to the pre-war standard, they should submit detailed reasons and calculation statements to the Commission for approval before implementation. Before approval is granted, they should continue to charge electricity prices according to the August 19th price and must not change them.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 21st] This reporter interviewed Zhang Lisheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and Yu Dawei, Minister of Communications, on the 21st to inquire about the issue of price increases in transportation enterprises. Zhang expressed with certainty that prices would not increase, because although the measures stipulated that pre-war prices could be restored, it was not mandatory. Yu told us that the Ministry of Communications is currently studying whether there is a need for adjustments based on the principle of "self-sufficiency" and reviewing the amounts of revenue and expenditure. Currently, in terms of expenditures, such as wages and coal, wages are roughly the same as the average pre-war wages, but the price ratio of coal is nearly twice as high as the original price. Therefore, he has issued a notice to the affiliated units to conduct research. The Ministry of Communications will decide on the issue of price increases after collecting reports from all parties, but Yu's attitude was extremely cautious, and he repeatedly stated that further research was necessary. Article 23 states that during the implementation period of these measures, the prohibition of lockouts, strikes, and slowdowns is of great importance for stabilizing the production process and increasing the strength to suppress the rebellion. A special telegram is sent to urge both labor and management to understand the difficulties of the time, faithfully comply, strictly prevent the instigation of bandits and traitors, and never give them an opportunity. Pay close attention at all times and in all places. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Grain Rations for Workers and the Poor Suspended</p>

This will be announced and implemented after obtaining the consent of the US Economic Cooperation Administration China Mission. Regarding the Ministry of Food's project for selling discounted food rations, the Executive Yuan has ordered the suspension of the original worker and public welfare food rations in Nanjing and Shanghai. The distribution of food rations to school faculty and staff, new Guan customs employees, and others will continue, but the distribution price will be increased, calculated at 50% of the market price.</p>

<h3>Currency Reform Can Succeed, Overall Situation Will Improve; US Officials Concerned About China's New Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] US officials expressed concern over China's decision to issue a new currency. Some hope that China's currency reform plan will succeed, and if the plan succeeds, it will have various beneficial effects on China's overall situation. Others took a wait-and-see attitude. A senior official believed that China might believe that if they tried hard to stop inflation, the United States might support them with gold or silver loans. Officials believe that China's currency reform plan will at least stabilize the currency situation, and during this period of currency stability, China may try to obtain US aid. It is believed here that for the currency reform to succeed, the Chinese government must (1) reduce spending, (2) increase tax revenue.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Qingdao, 21st] US West Pacific Fleet Commander Badger told reporters: The US military is very welcome to the China's currency reform, and from now on we will do our best to assist in the stability of China's finance.

<h3>Zhang Qun and His Wife Arrive in Tokyo; South Korean President Syngman Rhee Invites Zhang and Others to Visit; And Dispatches a Delegation to Visit China</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] Zhang Qun and his wife, along with external advisor Shao Tielin, took a Northwest Airlines flight to Japan at 8:20 yesterday morning for a fact-finding tour, scheduled to stay for three weeks. Many people went to Longhua Airport to see them off. Shang Zhen, head of our delegation to Japan, also telegraphed Zhuang Yulin, director of the delegation's Shanghai office, to take care of everything at the airport.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Zhang Qun arrived here by plane around 3 pm on the 21st and landed at Haneda Airport. Shang Zhen and his wife, the Director of the Allied General Headquarters' Diplomacy Bureau, and Sabauer, chairman of the Allied Committee for Japan, welcomed him at the airport. When Zhang and his wife got off the plane, they first met with Shang Zhen and his wife, and then the welcomers presented flowers to Zhang and his wife. The following is the text of Zhang's speech at the airport:</p>
<p>"My visit to Japan this time is purely in a private capacity to make an observation tour, and it does not contain any representative significance and I do not bear any specific tasks. I returned to China from the United States in 1945 for medical treatment and passed through Japan. I received generous hospitality from General MacArthur. Unfortunately, I had to return to China urgently, and I stayed in Japan for a total of three days. I have wanted to come again for a long time, but I was bound by my duties, and only today did I achieve this wish. The progress of Japan's peaceful and democratic construction after the war is the guarantee of Japan's national restoration and the basis for the permanent cooperative relationship between Japan and China and other countries in the world. Every person who cares about Japan and the overall situation in the world has the same feeling. I am here today with these common feelings and expectations. I am very grateful to General MacArthur of the Allied Headquarters for his kindness, which has facilitated this trip. Journalists may wish me to express some opinions, but since this trip is an observation tour, I will focus on listening and learning. Before obtaining a reasonably mature result of my observation, I have no opinion to express, and I hope you will understand."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] South Korean President Syngman Rhee announced that he will invite Zhang Qun, who is going to Japan, to visit Korea. Rhee also said that he has asked General Shang Zhen to come here as his special guest. While emphasizing the special friendship between China and Korea, Rhee said that he has appointed Cho Byung-ok, the newly appointed Police Chief and a special envoy of ambassadorial rank to the United States, as the head of the delegation to visit China, and the delegation will also go to the Philippines. The President also said that the Korean Parliament has passed an amnesty bill, and he will announce the amnesty soon.</p>

<h3>Celebrating the Establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association</h3>
<p>The Industrial Association Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan on October 7th of last year and promulgated for implementation by the National Government on the 27th of the same month. In March of this year, the Ministry of Social Affairs drafted implementing regulations, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. Thus, the legislative procedures for the Industrial Association were fully completed.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Social Affairs considers this city to be the industrial center of our country, and it is necessary to complete this organization as soon as possible to enhance unity. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs was instructed to be responsible for guiding the major trade associations and the industrial trade associations under the city to reorganize according to the new law and then prepare for the establishment of the Municipal Industrial Association. After four months of preparation, all preparatory procedures have been completed, and the inaugural meeting will be held today. The Ministers of Social Affairs and Industry and Commerce, as well as the heads of various departments in the city, will attend to provide guidance. It is reported that 73 units have applied to join the association, and the preparatory committee has received many proposals, some concerning industrial policies and others concerning labor-management issues. This is not only a pioneering event in the industrial and commercial organization of this city but also marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of China's industrial sector.</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Dynasty, the people's organization with the longest history and the most solid foundation has been the Chamber of Commerce. Most businesses engaged in manufacturing, selling, transporting, and financing participate according to the law, making it a leader in the industrial and commercial circles of various places. According to the current Chamber of Commerce Law, its constituent members are divided into three categories: commercial trade associations, public service trade associations, and import and export trade associations. The promulgation of the Industrial Association Law and the simultaneous repeal of the Industrial Trade Association Law indicate that the development of industry today has reached a considerable level of maturity and should be organized independently to smoothly promote its responsibilities. This is not only a significant advancement in organization but also a symbol of the development of industry itself.</p>
<p>In this period of economic turmoil, the industrial environment is worse than that of other industries. After the establishment of the Industrial Association, its passive tasks of patching up and supporting with difficulty will likely be more urgent than actively undertaking work. However, we believe that this extraordinary phenomenon is only a temporary scene in the transition period. Once the situation improves and the economy stabilizes, the great mission borne by the industrial sector will be completed by the Industrial Association's mediation and leadership.</p>
<p>Regarding the newly implemented currency system, knowledgeable people believe that whether the currency value can be consolidated depends on the stability of prices, and whether prices can be stabilized depends on whether production can be increased. Therefore, the future of the Industrial Association is not only a problem for the industrial sector itself but also a problem concerning the entire national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>As for the original Chamber of Commerce, after the establishment of the Industrial Association, various industrial associations have been reorganized and transferred, and their duties seem to be easier than before, but their strength will not be weakened as a result. Because industry and commerce are inherently integrated, and there is no conflict of interest, and the wholesale departments, sales departments, and retail departments set up by factories are all commercial in nature, and they must still join the respective commercial associations according to law and remain a part of the Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, the membership qualifications of the Industrial Association are quite strict. According to the draft Factory Law, it is necessary to have machines in operation and regularly employ 30 or more workers, or not have machines in operation and regularly employ 60 or more workers. Small factories that do not meet the above conditions must form commercial trade associations and join the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, most members of the Industrial Association must still join the Chamber of Commerce as members. The only difference is that a factory often has dual membership. The coordination of various internal matters and the negotiation of various external issues will not be hindered by the emergence of the new organization. On the contrary, the establishment of the Industrial Association has strengthened its momentum, which may be one of the main reasons why everyone welcomes the Industrial Association. In short, the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association will be like two wheels of a cart and two wings of a bird. In this autumn of economic instability, we hope that they will work together to overcome all the difficulties. The Municipal Industrial Association was born this morning, and we are happy to celebrate its birth and wish our country's industry a limitless future.</p>

<h3>Interrogating Students Suspected of Being Communist Spies in Various Schools is Legally Unobjectionable; People in Academic Circles in Nanjing Express Their Opinions</h3>
<p>[Reported by the Central News Agency from Nanjing on the 21st] The government has taken the necessary measures and has begun to eliminate the communist spies lurking in schools in the rear. The reporter interviewed people in academic circles to solicit their opinions. Professor Yang Youjiong said: Since the Special Criminal Court has been established, it is its duty to interrogate students suspected of being communist spies. From a legal point of view, it is unobjectionable. It would be best if the education authorities could also carry out a fundamental task at the same time, namely, the training and guidance of political thought. Professor Chen Guyuan said: At this moment, we really cannot condone students suspected of being communist spies. If no action is taken, the schools will be more chaotic next semester, and professors will not be able to teach. I believe that if necessary, it is perfectly legal and reasonable for the government to send military police to schools to arrest students suspected of being communist spies, because the military police have judicial responsibilities. Rui Yifu also agreed with the government's move and advocated that students should abide by the law and be summoned to court. If the evidence of guilt is true, they should be punished by law. If not, they can have the opportunity to defend themselves and dispel suspicion. The reporter then visited Sa Bendong, the director of the Physics Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, to inquire about his opinions on this matter. Sa Bendong believes that the government's interrogation of communist spies lurking in various schools according to law this time is a reasonable move. Since the government is handling this matter impartially and is holding a cautious attitude, he hopes that it can be dealt with quickly. Those with conclusive evidence should be judged according to law, and the innocent should be released as soon as possible to reassure the people. He said: "I am a researcher of natural science and know the importance of natural law in the natural world. The same is true for the law to the country and society. Under the national law, we have the obligation to respect and abide by the law."</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province's Conscription Quota Not Reduced; 3,600 People in the Second Phase Must Be Conscripted as Scheduled; The Amount of Land Tax Requisition is Being Continued to Request Central Government to Reduce</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Zhenjiang on the 21st] When Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang replied to reporters' inquiries today, he said that the rumor that the Jiangsu Provincial Government would be reorganized has been spreading for three years, but the provincial government has not yet received a clear order. As a person from Jiangsu, I only know how to serve my hometown, and I will obey the central government's orders for my departure and stay, so there is no need to dispel the rumors. As for the conscription quota for the second phase of this year, it is 3,600 people. However, because the bandit chaos in northern Jiangsu is frequent and the people's livelihood is difficult, the counties in southern Jiangsu cannot be biased. Therefore, I personally wrote to Commander-in-Chief Gu, requesting a reduction in the quota. Recently, I received a reply from Commander-in-Chief Gu, stating that the military administration is important during the suppression period, and the quota must still be conscripted as scheduled. Regarding the requisition of land, the central government had previously approved the tax rate for land in this province for the 37th year as one tax and one loan. The provincial government and the Provisional Consultative Council repeatedly telegraphed to request a reduction. As a result, the Ministry of Food has agreed to leave 25% of the loan item for local use. The provincial government and the Provisional Consultative Council are now continuing to request the central government to reduce it to one tax and half a loan to reduce the burden on the people. He Yushu, the director of the Provincial Land and Food Office, is now going to Nanjing to request the Ministry of Food to approve it as soon as possible so that it can be collected.</p>

In addition to discussing other cases, it also decided to reply to the Shanghai Municipal District Fundraising Committee, ordering the commendation of individuals in Shanghai who voluntarily donated. Upon receiving a telegram from the Shanghai District Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee, since this month, there have been continuous voluntary donations, but there is still a large gap from the prescribed quota. The committee has formulated two other measures to increase the effectiveness of fundraising. The first is to select the main wealthy people in the city and notify them to donate, and the legislators will personally persuade them to increase the effect. The second is to compile statistics on the settlement of foreign exchange and determine the amount of donations to make up for the shortage. All are being actively carried out, and the goal is to raise the fixed amount. Once the number of donations is reached, a list will be created and reported. It also passed the approval of the design of the honorary medal, which will be cast immediately for use. Also, the committee members who attended the meeting were very dissatisfied with the fact that Du Jianshi, the mayor of Tianjin, violated the law, changed the intention of the donors, and used part of the special relief donation funds to build city defense works. It was unanimously decided to immediately send a severe telegram to correct the misuse of funds and order them to be returned to the treasury within a specified period.</p>

<p>Lanzhou [Our Newspaper Lanzhou 21st Dispatch] The reaction to the economic reform plan in Lanzhou was quite good, mainly because the government's regulations on the exchange rates between Gold Yuan notes, old currency, and gold and silver were similar to those in the Lanzhou black market, so there was no concern about the devaluation of the old currency. In the past three days, because various banks and money houses have suspended payments, there has been no major trading in the market, and prices have been stable. Fluctuations are expected next Monday, and the authorities are paying close attention.</p>
<p>Gui Sui [Our Newspaper Gui Sui 21st Dispatch] Various banks and money houses in Gui Sui have been ordered to close, and the market is very stable.

Silver dollars are at 5.5 million.</p>
<p>Jinan [Our Newspaper Jinan 21st Dispatch] Since the promulgation of the new currency system, although the desire to trade in various goods in Jinan is weak, prices are still not low. 2 billion for twenty pieces of locally produced yarn, 29 million for a bag of first-class flour, 678 million for ornaments, and silver dollars plummeted from 12 million per piece a few days ago to 6 million, resulting in no one selling.</p>

Ornaments were quoted at 700 million, silver dollars at 6 million, and Three Machines Rice rose by 5 million, quoted at 51 million. Generally, larger transactions are taking a wait-and-see attitude. After the issuance of the new currency next Monday, the market will become clearer.</p>
<p>Ningbo [Our Newspaper Yin County 21st Dispatch] Except for the closure of jewelry stores on the 20th, other stores opened as usual. However, the market lacked cash, and business was slow. Grain boats arriving from the countryside also saw few buyers due to credit conditions. Most returned to their hometowns loaded. The market price of rice and grain fell by 3-5 million.</p>
<p>Guiyang [Our Newspaper Guiyang 21st Dispatch] Prices in Guiyang doubled on the 21st, but there were still prices without transactions. Business groups stated that they would use the price fluctuations in Shanghai and Shanghai as the standard, and hoped to open remittances as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Hong Kong [Central News Agency Hong Kong 21st Dispatch] After the initial shock of China's announcement of currency reform, the gold and currency market in Hong Kong was much calmer today, as banks here continued to accept them. The price of gold this afternoon was equivalent to HK$322.75. Trading this morning consistently ranged between 320 and 322 yuan. The exchange rate of US dollars in the open market also did not change much, consistently around HK$5.41.</p>

<p>Mayor Hopes for Assistance from Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 21st Dispatch] After the promulgation of the currency reform order, the Guangzhou Municipal Government specially convened a symposium of city-wide industry and commerce representatives at 6 PM on the 20th. Mayor Ouyang Ju personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech stating: "Currency reform is crucial to the survival of the nation. I hope that industry and commerce will do their utmost to assist, and the government will strive to stabilize prices." He also stated in a resolute tone: "After the new currency is issued, the scope of use of the Hong Kong dollar will definitely shrink. Citizens of this city mostly use the Hong Kong dollar as the unit of transaction. I hope to quickly correct this phenomenon." He then urged various representatives to set an example, not to be greedy for temporary gains, and to base prices on the prices of the 19th of this month according to the new currency ratio, and not to indiscriminately raise prices. The Guangzhou Police Bureau Director also declared in a firm tone, "There will be absolutely no leniency towards those who disrupt the market!"</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Formulates Measures to Control Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 21st Dispatch] After the currency reform, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has formulated measures to control commodity prices. The key points are to strictly prohibit private price increases. All goods must be sold at the prices of August 19th. Any violations will be handled in accordance with the Regulations on the Suppression of Disturbances during the Rebellion Period. As for the prices of public utilities, after being converted into new currency, if they have not reached pre-war levels, they will also not be allowed to rise. These measures will soon be issued to various counties and cities for thorough implementation. Commodity prices in Hangzhou remain stable today.</p>

<h3>Moscow Negotiations Approach Critical Point Three Envoys to Meet Stalin Tomorrow Weekend of Constant Consultations to Reconcile Differences</h3>
<p>[French News Agency London 21st Dispatch] The US State Department announced this morning that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov did not hold talks with the representatives of the three Western European powers in Moscow on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 21st Dispatch] Western countries urgently studied the reports of envoys stationed in the Soviet Union on the 21st and exchanged views on the situation in Berlin, preparing for the next Kremlin talks. There are rumors here and in Paris that Stalin will personally attend the next meeting. It is also said that, regardless of success or failure, this is the last meeting, but there is no verification. On the contrary, authoritative sources here warn against speaking of success or failure at this time. According to every indication, the current East-West negotiations have reached a critical juncture, but there is still no conclusive progress.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Bevin plans to stay in London over the weekend and report the situation to Prime Minister Attlee, who is currently on vacation in Ireland. Western countries are constantly engaged in heated discussions, preparing to deal with the most important, or perhaps the final, talks, which will be held on the 23rd. However, officials say that the meeting has been extended because the three governments need to adjust their opinions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 21st Dispatch] The bi-monthly "International Observer" published by the British government's Central News Bureau hinted on the 21st that the Soviet Union had refused to lift the blockade of Berlin in the Kremlin meeting. This hint came at a time when Western diplomats were warning everyone to refrain from predicting the success or failure of the Moscow negotiations. At the same time, the Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet Union said that Moscow reported that the Kremlin talks were "about to break down." However, the Soviet newspapers and radio stations in Germany adopted a "cold and hot" attitude towards the talks, aimed at preparing the general public for both success and failure. The "International Observer" remained silent about the content of the negotiations, but said that "Western countries still insist that the Berlin blockade should be lifted before discussions on broader issues begin."</p>
<p>[Associated Press London 21st Dispatch] The Berlin radio station denied on the 21st that it had reported the news that "Moscow telegrams indicated that the talks between the Kremlin and Western envoys were about to break down."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Moscow 20th Associated Press] Disagreements among the three Western countries themselves seem to be delaying the sixth, or perhaps final, meeting between Western representatives and Molotov. Well-informed observers firmly believe that the three Western countries have not yet reached a firm agreement on what to explain to Molotov in the next meeting. In the past few days, the representatives have repeatedly held meetings, and the representatives have exchanged opinions with their own governments and among the three governments several times. There are apparently some minor differences among the representatives of the three Western countries, which must be resolved before they meet with the Soviet Union again.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Cross Border in Berlin to Capture German Police US Military Commander Lodges Protest Armed British and American Military Police Stationed on Border to Suppress</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Berlin 21st Dispatch] The police in the American sector of Berlin today forwarded a document from Colonel Holley, commander of the American sector of Berlin, protesting the kidnapping of three German policemen by a Soviet patrol. The three policemen were captured yesterday by several Soviet soldiers at the intersection of the American and Soviet sectors. Colonel Holley said that if his protest is ineffective, the matter will be handed over to his superiors. He also said, "We can also take other measures to deal with it."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] Three squads of US military police suppression teams will be stationed in the downtown intersection area on the night of the 21st, as Soviet military police have been constantly capturing German police from the British and American sectors in that area. Each suppression team consists of 25 people, fully armed. According to indications, if the Soviet side continues to cross the border to capture people, the American side will resist. It is reported that the dispatch of the suppression teams was decided by senior police officers during an inspection of the incident site and approved by Ai Xihua, head of the American public security team. It is reported that British officials are also dispatching reserves to strengthen the strength of the military police. On the afternoon of the 21st, British and American military police jeeps shuttled through the streets of the intersection, and hundreds of curious German, British, American, and Soviet people stood on the sides of the street, waiting for the next action in the East-West police war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] Soviet military police arrested two more German policemen in Berlin on the 21st. At the same time, the leader of the German Communist Party called for street riots, urging workers to go to the Potsdam Square connecting the British, American, and Soviet sectors to "attack black market merchants and Fascist Party members." British officials said that the two German policemen were kidnapped within 120 yards of the British sector by about 50 Soviet military police patrolling Potsdam Square, who pointed their guns at them. One policeman struggled free and escaped into a dilapidated house, while the other was dragged into the Soviet sector.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Berlin 20th Dispatch] Colonel Holley, commander of the US military in Berlin, issued a communiqué today stating that the unfortunate incident on the 19th in the Putsdamai area, in which the police shot and injured six people, could have been avoided if the Soviet sector German police officers had not been known criminals. The continued tenure of Marcgraf as the police chief of the Soviet sector is an insult to the Berlin City Council elected by the people, so it is no wonder that the general public despises the police. However, in any case, the police should not fire at unarmed people. Holley concluded by saying that the US military government has done its best to eliminate speculators in the black market, but the inability to eliminate the black market is due to the Soviet blockade of Berlin.</p>
<h3>US Military Officer Reveals Soviet Plan to Conquer the World</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 20th Special Dispatch] According to the Washington non-official publication "Field Artillery Report" today, the Soviet Union has notified its vassal states that the chaos occurring in the Far East, Greece, and Palestine will create an environment favorable to the Kremlin's strategic plan to conquer the world. The paper was written by a retired Colonel Nan Sha. He said that the Soviet Union's plan to conquer the world was formulated last November and secretly distributed to its vassal states as a compass. Nan revealed that the content of the Soviet plan includes four stages: (1) Consolidate the internal unity of the vassal states; (2) Establish communist governments in Germany, Italy, and France; (3) Conquer Britain without war, because the power of its left-wing parties is increasing; (4) The United States is the final target, because its economic crisis will definitely worsen, and the US Communist Party will gain the power to control labor unions.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Calls on Bevin Delivers Memorandum on Establishing European Parliament</h3>
<p>[French News Agency London 21st Dispatch] The British Foreign Office announced today that Foreign Secretary Bevin received French Ambassador to Britain Massigli this morning.

<h3>US Senior Military Leaders Hold Meeting in Rhode Island Secretary of Defense Reports on US-Canada Discussions on Joint Defense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 21st Dispatch] According to Secretary of Defense Forrestal, senior military leaders in Washington have chosen the Naval War College in Rhode Island to hold a three-day meeting to discuss "major policy issues." Although the content of the discussions is strictly kept secret and no communiqué will be issued during the meeting, officials have revealed that the agenda will include issues related to strategic air force operations, secret weapons researched by US scientists, and their applications. Forrestal will report on his recent discussions in Ottawa on the US-Canada joint defense plan. US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, who returned to the United States from Europe today, will also report on the situation of the US Air Force being transferred to Berlin. Participants in the meeting also include Army Chief of Staff Bradley, Chief of Military Order and Planning Weidmeyer, and other senior leaders of the navy and air force.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Washington 20th Dispatch] Two days after US Secretary of Defense Forrestal went to Canada to meet with Canadian Minister of National Defence Claxton to discuss joint defense affairs between the two countries, he held a secret meeting with the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force at the Naval Academy in Newport, Rhode Island. According to well-informed sources, the results of the talks between Forrestal and Claxton will be included in the agenda, but not exclusively. The meeting will also discuss the extent to which the plan decided by the Chiefs of Staff of the three services at the Key West, Florida meeting in March has been implemented. The Key West meeting decided on the unification of the affairs of the three services, which has been accelerated with the support of Forrestal, but there are still some differences, especially Air Force Secretary Symington's insistence on establishing 70 Air Force groups, while Forrestal prefers 66 groups. It is expected that the Newport meeting will try to complete the unification of the affairs of the three services and will discuss the best way to utilize the new recruits who will be conscripted under the draft system. The meeting will also discuss military issues caused by the current international situation, so it will involve the results of Forrestal's talks with Claxton and the Canadian government's decision to increase its army from 35,000 to 42,000 personnel before Forrestal went to Canada. It is rumored that Forrestal and Claxton discussed US-Canada cooperation in jointly defending the northern part of the American continent. US military leaders believe that this area is strategically important, so it is necessary to build a network of gun emplacements and air force bases around it to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Military Aid to Western Europe Canada Willing to Cooperate with the United States</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Ottawa 21st Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, during the visit of US Secretary of Defense Forrestal to Canada to hold talks with the Canadian Minister of National Defence, the issue of Canada's participation in supplying arms to the signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty was one of the main agenda items. According to authoritative sources, Canada can export arms worth US$200 million annually to Western European countries through the United States. Well-informed people in the Canadian capital also said that before the economic recovery of Western Europe is completed, it seems necessary to first assist the military recovery of Western Europe. It was also heard that before Forrestal returned home, he paid great attention to the Canadian Defense Industries Commission, which was commissioned by the Canadian government to provide the Canadian government with information on domestic military potential.</p>
<h3>79 US Jet Aircraft Arrive in Germany</h3>

<h3>After the US Sets a Deadline for the Soviet Consul General to Leave the US The Soviet Union May Take Retaliatory Measures Lomakin Has Booked a Ship Ticket and Will Leave the US Next Saturday</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 21st Dispatch] The State Department braced itself on the 21st to deal with Moscow's new diplomatic offensive. Diplomatic circles here expect that the Soviet Union will have a swift and sharp reaction to the US request that Soviet Consul General in New York Lomakin return home immediately. Officials said that this was one of the most unpleasant events between the two countries since the war, and the Soviet Union has expressed resentment. Some people expect that the Soviet Union will take retaliatory measures against US consular personnel stationed in Moscow and Vladivostok. It is also said that the Soviet government will be forced to "fabricate some absurd charges against our officials—which they have done before."</p>
<p>[Associated Press New York 20th Dispatch] Consul General Lomakin, who was requested by the State Department to be recalled by the Soviet government for "improper actions" in the Samson Case, has booked a ticket on the "Stockholm" mail ship, which is scheduled to sail on the 28th. Although Lomakin himself refused to comment on the US government's condemnation of his "highly improper" behavior, he told reporters waiting at the door of the consulate: "You are wasting your time," but his plans were still leaked by an employee of the Swedish American Line. The employee said that Lomakin had notified the company by letter a few days ago that he had booked tickets for himself, his wife, and their two children.</p>
<h3>Soviet Plot to Stage Coup in South [Yugoslavia] - Moscow Establishes "Free Yugoslavia" Committee - Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Denounces Tito Regime</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 20th] A Central News Agency reporter has learned from sources here today that Moscow is currently plotting to launch a coup in Yugoslavia to overthrow the Tito regime and establish a legitimate Stalinist communist government. It is reported that Stalin has issued a decree to establish a "Free Yugoslavia Committee" in the Soviet capital, composed of anti-Tito Yugoslav exiles in the Soviet Union. It is rumored that if Tito is overthrown, Bekold-Tijanić has been designated to succeed him. It is generally believed that Bekold is currently in Moscow.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Budapest, 20th] Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Rajkótsi delivered a speech to 70,000 farmers on the 20th, denouncing Marshal Tito's regime as a "gangster leader" that inflicts terror, pain, abuse, and even tragedy on Yugoslavia. He stated, "Tito and his subordinates basely murdered their heroes and employed terrorist tactics throughout the country. They tormented, imprisoned, and abused comrades who supported the Soviet Union, the Cominform, and the trade unions." Rajkótsi further criticized Lieutenant General Ivanožić for being fatally shot while attempting to flee to Romania. Two days before Rajkótsi's attack on this matter, the Romanian Gazette denounced it as a "despicable murder." Rajkótsi continued, "The current 'gangster leaders' of Yugoslavia are leading our southern neighbors to tragedy."</p>
<p>This matter indicates that Lomakin had already packed his bags before the U.S. government requested his recall. It remains uncertain whether Lomakin's plan to leave the U.S. was because he already knew of the State Department's action, or whether Moscow had already ordered him to return home in response to his actions in the Kasenkina case. Lomakin is apparently the only senior Soviet official in New York who decided to leave the U.S. immediately. According to a spokesman for the Swedish American Line, no other Soviet consulate personnel have reserved cabins to return home. Soviet personnel generally travel via Sweden, disembarking in Gothenburg, traveling by car to Stockholm, and then taking a ship to Finland before returning to Moscow by train. News of Lomakin's return home was initially released by an employee of the Swedish American Line in Gothenburg, and then confirmed here.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th] The State Department today publicly announced the note delivered to the Soviet ambassador yesterday. A State Department spokesman stated that the State Department had declared the revocation of the accreditation of the Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, and requested that Mr. Lomakin leave the United States within 72 hours. The State Department spokesman also said that the U.S. government does not consider the Kasenkina and Samarin case to be closed with Lomakin's departure, and that the investigation will continue. The Soviet Consulate has made no comment on the U.S. note.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, Associated Press] Lomakin, the Soviet Consul General in New York who has been asked to return home by the United States, may depart for home next week to face his enraged superiors. The unfortunate Lomakin has placed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in an awkward international position due to the case of the three Soviet teachers, and he has now been ordered to close the consulate and leave the United States within three or four days. President Truman's press secretary, Ross, stated that President Truman would not immediately withdraw Lomakin's credentials, as doing so would force him to close the consulate immediately and place an unnecessary burden on the embassy. The order to withdraw the credentials may be issued within three or four days, at which time Lomakin will leave the United States as an ordinary Soviet citizen without any official title. Reporters generally believe that Lomakin will inevitably face severe criticism upon his return home. The hospital where Mrs. Kasenkina is staying issued a statement stating that her condition has "improved," but she is still not out of danger. Her eating and breathing are better than before, and her temperature has "slightly decreased, and her pulse is closer to normal."</p>

<h3>Soviets Expand Air Force - Current Air Force Personnel Number 400,000 - Monthly Aircraft Production is 1,000</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] According to the 1948 World Aviation Yearbook, the Soviet Union currently has an air force of 400,000 personnel and 14,000 aircraft, including jet aircraft. Currently, the Soviet Union can produce 1,000 aircraft per month, including heavy bombers similar to the B-29 and 200 jet aircraft. The Soviet Union has dozens of aircraft manufacturing plants, mostly located within European territory, especially concentrated in the Volga River basin. A small number of factories are also located in the Urals and Siberia, engaged in the manufacturing of five types of jet aircraft. In terms of civil aviation, the Soviet Union's major cities are all served by air routes. However, some cities' airfields cannot be used year-round due to severe weather conditions. The Soviet Union has established 79 weather stations throughout the Arctic Circle, and their work has been highly successful. Finally, according to the yearbook's estimate, the Soviet Union imported aircraft parts from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom this year, worth a total of $1.5 million.</p>

Police captured communists in La Coruña in Galicia and Pamplona in Navarre, confiscating firearms, ammunition, and anti-government propaganda. A total of nine communist leaders were captured at the communist headquarters in a magnificent mansion in La Coruña.

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Saito, the chief of the Japanese National Police Headquarters, visited Cabinet Secretary General Kometi on the morning of the 21st to exchange views on the issue of expanding police equipment. It is reported that Mr. Saito requested strengthening police administration on the grounds of suppressing violent groups. Because the quota of police officers is limited, he planned to enrich mobile equipment and sought the government's opinion. As a result, Tomibechi believed that the matter was related to the budget and hoped that a specific plan for enriching mobile equipment would be submitted.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The Hokkaido branch of the National Railway Workers' Union has been on strike for many days since July to protest the revision of the National Public Service Law. The Ministry of Transportation authorities believe that this fact violates government orders and have arrested 15 branch committee members, leading to a further deterioration of the situation. In the Hakodate branch, the number of participants in the strike movement has reached as many as 475, greatly reducing the number of freight cars running and causing great obstacles to transportation operations. As of 5 p.m. on the 20th, 98 people had resumed work, and the National Police had issued 442 arrest warrants, with 169 people having been arrested. In addition, Saito, chief of the National Police Headquarters, stated on the 20th that he would take a "tough stance of prosecuting those who do not resume work."</p>

<h3>Prelude to the American Election, No. 3 - Cheap Political Tricks</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[Airmail from This Newspaper, New York, August 2nd] In American history, it is rare to use the halls of Congress as a campaign ground. Although President Truman's sudden summoning of a "special session" was scolded by Taft as a "cheaply auctioned political trick," and although it was scolded by Vandenberg as "the hysterical gasps of a dying regime before its demise," the special session was, after all, convened. Truman's "ruthless move" undoubtedly, as the "New York Times" said, dealt a serious blow to the Republican Party's prestige in the November election.</p>
<p>On the day Congress convened, all American Republican newspapers, as well as newspapers related to the Republican Party, published a photograph of "sparse attendance in the hall." There were two congressmen, and they placed their legs on the seats in the front row. The photographer was probably specifically choosing the emptiest corner to photograph, because in reality, the hall did not appear empty. Out of a total of 435 congressmen, 310 attended this time, which was no more inferior than usual. Before the meeting on Monday, the Republican senators and representatives had an informal meeting to discuss how to deal with Truman's "ruthless move."</p>
<p>President Truman did not go to Congress to give a speech until noon on Tuesday, reading his speech manuscript for only 24 minutes. He emphasized the economic crisis in the United States, especially the crisis of rising prices caused by inflation. He said: "The communists are counting the days of economic depression in the United States every day. We must avoid this depression." He also said: "If the economic foundation of the United States is shaken, the serious consequences suffered by other parts of the world will be unimaginable." He believes that today's world situation is very urgent. In order to cope with emergencies, we cannot wait until the next session of Congress convenes. We must immediately convene this special summer session of Congress to jointly discuss the major policies and strategies of the country.</p>
<p>The President's speech was grand and was a direct challenge to the Republican Party. For the "die-hards" in the South, Truman used a way to avoid the important and take the light, hoping to gently flash through. In the entire speech, regarding the "National Rights Bill," there were only 113 simple words, the general idea being: In order to forever maintain the brilliance of the American Constitution and thoroughly realize the concepts of freedom and equality for American citizens, it is necessary to eliminate racial discrimination, racial prejudice, and ensure that American citizens of all races have equal employment opportunities. Therefore, the National Rights Protection Bill is proposed.</p>
<p>The "die-hards" in the South caused strong resentment in Congress. Mississippi Congressman Colmer declared that he would swear to oppose Truman. Senator Johnston from South Carolina advocated an immediate adjournment so everyone could go home for the summer. Every time Congress convened for debate over the past week, Johnston had the same expression: "This meeting is simply boring, a waste of energy, a waste of money, and boring to the extreme!" He urged everyone to agree with his opinion and immediately adjourn the special session of Congress until December 31st to discuss these bills!" In fact, Johnston did not sincerely intend to not hold a meeting. He wanted to deliberately attack Truman and give Truman a "disappointing start."</p>
<p>The most severe of the Southern Congressmen is Georgia Senator Russell, who is the foremost figure opposing the "National Rights Protection Bill." He knows that the number of Southern congressmen is small and the vote will inevitably fail, so he advocates cooperating with the Republican Party. The South supports the Republican Party's opposition to Truman's "price control plan," hoping that the Republican Party will support the South's opposition to the "National Rights Bill." Russell hopes to make Truman's proposed "National Rights Protection Bill" an amendment to the American Constitution, and a constitutional amendment is not as easy to pass as ordinary laws.</p>
<p>However, Taft rejected Russell's proposal. Taft believes that the Republican Party opposes all of Truman's proposals, except for agreeing to Truman's "National Rights Protection Bill," because since President Lincoln, the Republican Party has consistently advocated improving the social status of blacks and has consistently advocated racial equality. Taft is almost the busiest person in Congress. He is the highest person in charge of domestic affairs for both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Taft's theoretical basis is: First, Truman's views on fiscal economics are not accurate at all. Truman's high-profile is to deceive the world and steal fame, to deceive the American people, and to fight for the November election. Second, Trúman himself has no intention of stopping inflation, because the formation of inflation in the United States today is due to the government's abuse of money. Truman does not stop the administrative agency's "abuse" but comes to Congress to appeal, which is completely a political speech. (The American people deeply detest the term "playing politics" because "playing politics" means unreal.) Third, Truman's so-called price control measures are completely the style of a "police state" and run counter to the traditional American concept of free enterprise.</p>
<p>In Congress, the orthodox faction of the Democratic Party (except for the "die-hards" in the South) mostly support Truman. The great debater Barkley, this 70-year-old Kentucky senator, Truman's "campaign companion," lashed out at Taft. He said: Taft himself is playing political tricks. He believes that Congress should be selfless and impartial, seek welfare for the people, and not be bound by preconceptions.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the most important topics of this special session are the two major issues of price control and stopping inflation. The President's Council of Economic Advisers sent Congress a "mid-year report," which separately described employment, wages, production, trade, and rapidly rising prices. One sentence in the report stated that the Congress under the control of the Republican Party is blindly and unscrupulously deepening the economic crisis in the United States.</p>
<p>Republicans strongly expressed indignation at this passage. They believe that Truman's challenge is overly fierce. House Banking Committee Chairman Wolcott, a Republican congressman from Michigan, angrily accused the government of spending money too easily, creating credit inflation, and thus inflation. He said: "The United States today has no price controls, no rationing system, but there is still a large, large amount of production." He said: "Rising prices are not a matter of control or not, it depends on whether the government can contract credit!"</p>
<p>In the Senate and House Banking Committees, the debate on economic issues was very intense and very profound. Paul Porter, the price control director who was considered a "thorn in the side" by Republican congressmen two years ago, appeared again before many Republican congressmen with disgust. Paul Porter is still so calm. This economic expert with a scholarly air has been retained by Truman in the President's Office as Truman's economic advisor since the Price Control Bureau was abolished in 1946. Most of Truman's economic management theory, the "police state" theory deeply hated by Republican congressmen, comes from Paul Porter. He was again designated by Truman this time as the representative to explain relevant economic bills. He is responsible for explaining the economic bills proposed by the President to Congress.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Treasury Snyder and Federal Reserve Board Chairman McCabe were also invited to Congress to explain the economic situation along with Paul Porter. The Secretary of the Treasury believed that he has always opposed price controls, but in times of emergency, they are also necessary. He believes that controlling prices and contracting credit are both the most important virtues for the United States today. McCabe, on the other hand, believes that it is too idealistic to completely expect "contracting credit." He reported that today's American currency is three times that of before the war, while the total amount of production has only increased by 90 percent compared to before the war (less than double), so restoring wartime consumer credit control is an urgent matter. However, if the people are willing and able to slightly limit the national purchasing power, it will be of great benefit to prices.</p>
<p>However, Senator Tauber, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, disagrees. He believes that limiting consumption will inevitably kill production. He said: The only way to solve the economic problems of the United States is to increase production, production first. He said: Free prices are the best way to reward production. With increased production, prices will naturally fall. He said that Truman's economic theory is putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>The debate has not ended yet, and it seems that Truman's eleven proposals will inevitably end without results. Truman summoned such an "emergency special session" in the midst of his busy schedule. If viewed from the perspective of us Chinese, today's price problem in the United States is really not worthy of the slightest bit of urgency. Opposing racial bias is originally a good thing, but it is not an urgent problem either. The Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army said: "The U.S. Army's separate organization of blacks and whites has a consistent and excellent tradition. The Army authorities have no intention of changing to a mixed organization." Southern Senator Manpunk quoted the Chief of Staff's words and greatly attacked Truman. Mississippi Senator Stennis gave a speech in Congress for two and a half hours, analyzing the historical basis for the Southern treatment of blacks and whites separately. He said: If Truman wants to use a law to create a tragedy in the South, it would be tantamount to Hitler's actions.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not an urgent issue that can be resolved overnight. The reason why it is "urgent" and "special" is all for the "political tactics" of the November election. Taft said angrily in the corridor of the Congress building: "Why call an emergency meeting? I can't find any emergency reasons!" A reporter asked: "Is it because of the Berlin crisis emergency?" Taft suddenly felt something, he pushed his glasses up, raised his head, and couldn't help but laugh!</p>

<h3>Punishing Activities Disrupting Prices - Most Severe Means Will Be Applied - Joint Meeting of Top Leaders Discusses Two Points - Chiang Ching-kuo Assists in Supervising and Guiding Work to Stabilize Finance and Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 11:00 AM yesterday, an important joint meeting was held at the Yuyuan Road residence of Central Bank President Yu. Those in attendance were all top leaders and relevant personnel from this city, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Xu Baiyuan, Yu Shuping, Chiang Ching-kuo, etc. The meeting lasted until 1:30 PM, and the contents were kept secret. It is reported that the main topics of discussion were how to overcome possible difficulties in implementing emergency financial and economic measures, and how to punish those who disrupt price stability. It is possible that a supervisory organization will be established in Shanghai in the future, presided over by Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo, specializing in supervising and guiding the work of stabilizing finance and prices. After the market opens tomorrow, financial authorities and relevant local agencies will closely coordinate to supervise various transactions. The most severe means will be used to deal with black market transactions and activities that disrupt prices, and if necessary, a few will be executed as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Three Proclamations: Stabilize Prices - Only Allowed to Fall, Not Rise; Problems Will Be Resolved Immediately</h3>
<p>The municipal government, in order to cooperate with the central government's new financial and economic plan, convened a meeting with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors at 10:00 AM on the 21st. More than 50 responsible individuals from various trade associations attended, and Mayor Wu personally presided. First, Mayor Wu declared that after the central government's decision was announced, the people and the government should share the same confidence. Hereafter, prices should no longer fluctuate. He then made three proclamations to the representatives from various industries: (1) All prices will be based on the prices of the 19th as the standard. They are only allowed to decrease, not increase. Anyone who raises prices without authorization will be severely punished by the government. (2) Black markets will not be allowed to exist. (3) If industrial and commercial enterprises encounter special difficulties, the government will find ways to solve them. Finally, Mayor Wu expressed that stabilizing finance, stabilizing prices, increasing production, and developing trade are critical to success, and he urged everyone to comply diligently. Subsequently, Mr. Xu Xueyu spoke on behalf of the attendees, saying that the central government's new policy would greatly benefit the industrial and commercial sectors and solve many current difficulties. The industrial and commercial sectors should support it, and the matter of maintaining the prices of the 19th should be followed. However, he hoped that the government would also abide by it together with the people in the future, and that state-owned enterprises should set an example. He also hoped that the price of the next rice ration would not be increased again. Mayor Wu agreed to consult the central government before making a decision. Afterwards, various industries successively explained the current situation. Generally, it was very stable, and wholesale prices had mostly fallen. Only some peddlers who did not understand the true nature of the government's measures had raised prices. It was believed that this phenomenon could be eliminated. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>First Announcement After the New Currency: Gasoline Prices Reduced</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The price of gasoline in this city, which had increased to 4.96 million yuan per gallon starting from the 20th, will now be restored to the old price implemented on the 19th of this month, in accordance with the government's promulgation of emergency measures for economic and financial management. The price will remain at 3.53 million yuan per gallon starting today.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Shipping Rates on Two Railways: Xie Zhen Went to Beijing Yesterday to Request Instructions</h3>
<p>Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, convened an emergency meeting of heads of various departments on the afternoon of the 21st to discuss the issue of shipping rates after the currency reform. After the meeting, Deputy Director Xie Zhen, along with relevant materials, went to Beijing to request instructions from the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Reducing Automobile Licenses: The Reason Lies in the Continued Import of Military Vehicles</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the matter of reducing automobile licenses, a person in charge of the relevant department of the Public Utilities Bureau told reporters yesterday that there were indeed difficulties in implementing this in this city. However, the problem was not in offending influential figures, but mainly because vehicles were still being imported as of now. If the central government allows the import of cars while ordering local governments to reduce the number of licenses already issued, this would be the biggest problem. Furthermore, the streets in this city are narrow and traffic conditions are complex. Tricycles and rickshaws are particularly obstructive to traffic. Therefore, the issuance of licenses for these vehicles had already been decided to be stopped. If automobile licenses are reduced on the one hand, and at the same time, the issuance of tricycle and rickshaw licenses is absolutely not allowed due to traffic problems, this would also be quite troublesome for the staff handling the matter.</p>
<h3>District Court Cooperates with New Measures: Discusses Handling of Various Cases</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to cooperate with the President's Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters, the local court of this city convened a meeting yesterday of persons in charge of various departments and presiding judges of civil and criminal courts. The meeting thoroughly discussed issues such as how to declare and enforce the main text of civil debt cases, how to determine the standard for criminal fines, and how to handle cases that violate these measures. No decision was reached by the evening. A final decision will be made tomorrow.</p>
<h3>New Rent Standards to be Drafted: Opinions to be Solicited Regularly</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau stated yesterday that after the currency reform, house rents in this city will be calculated in terms of Gold Yuan. New rent standards are currently being drafted. On the 26th of this month, representatives from the City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Real Estate Association, and other legal entities will be invited to solicit opinions as a reference for setting new rent standards. The new standards will be based on the demands of both landlords and tenants, and a compromise will be reached. As for public school teachers and government employees, whose salaries have not increased, whether or not their rents should be discounted is also under consideration, in the hope of obtaining a more reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Land Appreciation Tax: Tax Rate Divided into Four Types</p>
<p>The land appreciation tax in this city will be levied starting from September 1st. Because land appreciates over a certain period of time, which is driven by social forces, the state levies an appreciation tax. The tax is divided into two types: (1) a one-time tax is levied upon transfer, (2) for non-transfer, a tax is levied once every ten years. The tax rate is divided into four levels: (1) If the actual amount of land appreciation is below 100% of the original price, 20% will be levied. (2) If the actual amount of land appreciation is below 200% of the original price, 40% will be levied. (3) If the actual amount of land appreciation is below 300% of the original price, 60% will be levied. (4) If the actual amount of land appreciation exceeds 300%, 80% will be levied.</p>
<h3>Research on Adjusting Postal and Telecommunication Fees</h3>
<p>According to information from the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the Postal Bureau, the fee for sending an ordinary telegram was 10 cents per word before the war. The current price is 40,000 yuan per word, which is only 0.0133 Gold Yuan. The postage for ordinary letters was 5 cents before the war, and the current price is 15,000 yuan, which is only 0.005 Gold Yuan. It is reported that the Nanjing Telecommunications Administration and the Postal Administration are currently studying reasonable adjustment methods.</p>
<h3>Government's Currency Reform Order: Council and Other Organizations Jointly Telegraph Support</h3>

<h3>All Sectors Held a Grand Gathering Yesterday: To See Off the Central Plains慰勞 Group - The Speaker Hoped to Convey Enthusiasm to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The great victory in eastern Henan boosted the entire country. In order to express respect to the soldiers on the front lines, the National慰勞 General Association organized the Central Plains慰勞 Group. Zhang Fang was appointed as the head of the group, Xie Renzhao as the deputy head, and Zhang Yipin, Wang Yizhai, Guo Shaoqiu, Yang Baolin, and others as members, representing all sectors of the country, to慰勞 the troops in the Xuzhou and Zhengzhou areas. Beforehand, all sectors of this city raised a large number of medicines, daily necessities, books, and publications, and engraved many commemorative medals. Famous calligraphers in Shanghai also collectively painted more than 500 folding fans. Fang Zhi, the chairman of the Kuomintang City Party Headquarters, and Zhou Lixing, the commander of the port, personally wrote letters to the soldiers on the front lines. Sixteen organizations, including the China Merchants Bureau, the General Labor Union, and the City Board of Education, also specially made sixteen brocade banners, all of which will be entrusted to the group to bring to the front lines and distribute to all the officers and men fighting the rebellion.</p>
<p>Tianchan Theater - Expanded Publicity</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM yesterday, all sectors held a send-off meeting for the Central Plains慰勞 Group at the New Life Club. Speaker Pan personally presided and, after delivering a speech, stated that the慰勞 money brought to the front lines by the慰勞 Group was only 20 billion yuan. He hoped that all sectors of this city could contribute more to raise 10,000 Gold Yuan. He then stated that in order to enable all the people to convey their enthusiasm for慰勞ing the front lines, it was decided to convene another expanded publicity meeting at the Tianchan Theater on the 24th of this month, so that the慰勞 Group could fully listen to opinions from all parties and convey them to the soldiers on the front lines. At that time, thousands of people's representatives will participate in the meeting, and its significance will include: (1) supporting the government's anti-traitor movement, (2) demonstrating the determination of the front lines to fight the rebellion unanimously, (3) after the currency reform, the lives of the soldiers on the front lines can be raised to pre-war levels, and social order in the rear will also become more stable. The meeting will ensure that both the front and rear deeply understand this point.</p>
<p>Earnestly Hope to Take On the Mission of Exchange</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mayor Wu, on behalf of the municipal government, Councilor Wang, Deputy Secretary-General of the National慰勞 General Association Lu Jingshi, and representatives from all sectors Yu Wen, Tan Yimin, Xie Yonghua, Luo Dunwei, and others delivered speeches one after another, all hoping that the慰勞 Group could shoulder the mission of exchanging opinions between the front and rear. Finally, Zhang Fang, the head of the group, and Xie Renzhao, the deputy head, answered, expressing their determination to accept the entrustment of all sectors and complete the task. At the same time, they suggested that this city should regularly launch慰勞 efforts in the future. For example, dance halls should be persuaded to donate慰勞 money, so that the soldiers on the front lines can be assured that all the citizens of this city are not living in a drunken stupor, and that a strong connection can be completed spiritually. Finally, Speaker Pan read a telegram from Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the慰勞 General Association, expressing gratitude to the singers of this city for going to the front lines to慰勞 the troops before Air Force Day. It is reported that the singers will be invited to attend and participate in the expanded publicity meeting on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Labor Office Holds Symposium on Wage Conversion Issues - Several Opinions Formulated - Submitted to the Evaluation Committee for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the currency reform, regarding the method of calculating wages for employees in various private industries in this city, the Social Affairs Bureau has already received instructions from the Ministry of Social Affairs, instructing it to study and formulate wage standards and implementation rules with reference to Articles 13, 14, 22, and 23 of the Measures for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Economic Control, in order to reduce disputes. It is learned that before Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau went to Beijing, he instructed the Labor Office of the bureau to study methods for converting wages into Gold Yuan. Yesterday, the office convened all staff members of the Mediation and惠工 sections to hold a symposium on the issue of wage conversion. More than 30 people, including Fan Zhen and Huang Changhan, attended. Director Shen Ding chaired the meeting and, based on Article 22 of the Measures for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Economic Control: "The salaries of employees in private enterprises shall be paid in Gold Yuan, but their semi-monthly income shall not exceed the amount in Legal Tender converted into Gold Yuan that the enterprise originally stipulated for the first half of August," the principles were studied. There was a thorough discussion on how to calculate wages for those who habitually use the previous period's index or the average of the previous period's and the current period's index, and how to convert wages for processing, suspension of work, reduced working hours, and piecework. Several opinions were formulated and will be submitted to Director Wu for review and then submitted to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for approval before implementation.</p>
<h3>Wages According to Pre-War Base Salary - Practically Impossible to Achieve</h3>
<p>According to relevant sources who spoke to reporters, the wages of workers in various private industries were generally around 30 yuan before the war. After the Legal Tender was converted into Gold Yuan, the industrial sector hoped to restore the pre-war base salary. In fact, the value of the Gold Yuan is only half of the pre-war Legal Tender, so this is impossible to achieve. It is heard that the current wage conversion will be based on a method of gradually discounting workers' base salaries above 30 yuan, multiplying by the previous period's index for August, and then converting it into Gold Yuan for calculation.</p>

<h3>Dance Halls Deserted - Only Due to a Shortage of Cash</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Most of the major dance halls in this city had signs hanging at their entrances yesterday, reading "Patrons, please pay in cash only; checks and promissory notes will not be accepted."

The employees made three demands to the company: (1) those who are not ill should be reinstated immediately, (2) those who have had tuberculosis but have now recovered should also be reinstated, (3) those who are indeed ill should be given leave for treatment and recuperation and should not be dismissed summarily. The company has accepted the first point, but refuses to consider the other two. The dismissed employees' request for severance pay has also been unsuccessful. Yesterday, the dismissed employees of the company held a reception for reporters at Chunghua New Village to report on the progress of the dispute and appeal for social sympathy.</p>

<h3>Takahashi Cavalry Squad Leader - Has Conflict on Public Bus - Shots Fired, Grazing Ticket Collector - All Lines Suspended for Three Hours - Resolved After Joint Mediation by Police and Public Utilities Bureaus</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At around 11:00 AM yesterday, when Public Bus No. 605 on Route 3 was leaving the Bund on Beijing Road, Jiang Guobin, the leader of the Third Platoon of the Cavalry Patrol Squad of the Gaoqiao Police Bureau stationed in Pudong, insisted on opening the door and boarding the bus. At the time, Zhang Minggang, the ticket collector on the bus with number 243, instructed him to take a later bus because the bus had already started and he was afraid of danger. However, Jiang ignored him and followed closely, banging on the bus door. Zhang had no choice but to ring the bell, stop the bus, and open the door. After boarding the bus, Jiang, without asking for any reason, hit him twice with his cape roll, causing a conflict. At that time, other ticket collectors resting at the ticket booth near the station saw this and stepped forward to question him. Jiang became enraged and pulled out his official pistol and fired a shot, the bullet grazing Zhang Minggang's head and neck, injuring his scalp. After causing the trouble, Jiang took the opportunity to break through the crowd and escaped to the front of the Bank of China on Beijing Road, where he was eventually stopped by passersby and some ticket collectors. Jiang fired another shot, fortunately not injuring anyone. The crowd then snatched his gun and beat him severely. At that time, the Huangpu Police Bureau in charge had been informed and Director Feng led his section chiefs and others to the scene. At the same time, Wang Zongshan, the head of the Traffic Section of the Public Utilities Bureau, also arrived upon hearing the news and mediated the situation together. First, the injured ticket collector Zhang Minggang and the cavalry patrol squad leader Jiang Guobin who caused the trouble were sent to Gongji and Renji Hospitals for treatment. Director Feng also guaranteed on the spot that he would handle the case fairly. When the conflict occurred, public buses on all routes temporarily stopped running upon hearing the news. By 2:00 PM, after the dispute was resolved, they gradually resumed operation.</p>

<h3>Twelve Fishmongers Prosecuted for Forging Fish Market Entry Permits</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Fishmonger Qiu A'yu could not find an entry permit when the fish market was auctioning, so he could not enter. He had a bizarre idea and ordered Wang Changgui, who runs a flag shop, to make 31 forged "Shanghai Fish Market Auction Entry Permits." Wang knew that these were forged, but he introduced Wang Huagen, who runs a wood carving shop, to carve a wooden stamp and a rubber stamp of "Shanghai Fish Market Broker" for Qiu to affix to the forged entry permits. After obtaining the permits, Qiu secretly sold them to fishmongers Yu Zengfu and Liu A'xiang for profit. Soon, seven other fishmongers, including Zheng A'shan, also learned about this and borrowed them from Yu and Liu. As a result, the fish market discovered this and reported it to the Yulin Police Sub-bureau, which transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, all twelve of the above were prosecuted for forging special permits.</p>

<h3>Two Russian Thugs - Vandalize Park Apartments - Maid Injured While Trying to Intervene</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The mistress of Room 106, Park Apartments, 455 Fuxing Middle Road, is named Keine Zi Kainna, a Russian, 45 years old. She used to have an Italian lover named Fang Tianqian, who was a senior employee at an Italian bank. He returned to his country six months ago to visit his family. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, Kainna went to celebrate her girlfriend's birthday. Unexpectedly, at around 6:30 PM, two Russian thugs suddenly came to the apartment and, without asking for any reason, vandalized all five or six rooms, scattering furniture everywhere. Several pianos were placed, and the keys were pried off. At the scene, a Russian maid, Kailaisi Nikola (49 years old), tried to dissuade them with gentle words, but they became angry and used wooden sticks to hit her on the head, fracturing her right arm and causing blood to spurt out. At the same time, a street youth named Kelasha, a boxer, from Room 306 on the third floor heard the alarm and rushed down, intending to fight them. Seeing that they were no match, the thugs fled by jumping out of the window. Kelasha then called the nearby police, who found a new "Adikai" raincoat on the wasteland, containing an 8-inch revolver, five bullets, two magazines, one silver dollar, and more than 10 million Legal Tender. At the time, the Songshan Police Sub-bureau in charge had also been informed and ordered section member Chen Linshu to lead the police to the scene. They took the firearms and other items left by the thugs to the bureau for investigation. It is reported that the case involves international espionage.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Review Committee Reviews Electricity Company Accounts and Proposes Four Points for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Public Utilities Open Investigation and Review Committee held its second meeting at 3:30 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room. Mayor Wu presided, and attendees included councilors Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Qu Yue, Li Wenjie, Shao Yongsheng, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce’s Yan E’sheng, General Labor Union’s Shui Xiangyun, Accountants Association’s He Yuanming, Electrical Engineers Association’s Pan Mingxin, Social Affairs Bureau’s Zhang Chude, Public Utilities Bureau’s Zhao Zengjue, and representatives from Shanghai, French, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and Chinese-owned electricity companies, totaling over twenty people. The chairman first reported that the initial general meeting had resolved to notify each company to provide various materials for public review and decided to first review the Shanghai Electric Power Company's income and expenditure accounts. The review would commence immediately. Shanghai Electric Power Company presented a detailed report on business income and expenditure yesterday, distributed to each committee member. The income and expenditure report covered the period from August 1, 1947, to July 31, 1948, with a total reported loss of 178.6 billion yuan, and a loss of 92.6 billion yuan in July of this year. During yesterday's review by the committee, the focus was initially on reviewing the accounts for July of this year, item by item. As a result of the review, the following four points were raised: (1) Coal and fuel oil are the lifeblood of public utilities, and this expenditure is the most significant, with coal accounting for 20% and oil accounting for 80%. According to the company's report, the minimum monthly requirement for coal and oil is 18,000 tons. However, the ratio of coal or oil required per kilowatt-hour of electricity was not provided by Shanghai Electric Power Company at yesterday's meeting, and it was decided to review this again at the next meeting. (2) Regarding the issue of employee salaries, according to statistical results, the percentage of employee salaries in each kilowatt-hour of electricity cost is 13.4% for Shanghai Electric Power Company, 21.1% for the French company, 13.7% for Zhabei, 20.1% for the Chinese company, and 18.5% for Pudong. Pan Mingxin, the representative of the Electrical Engineers Association, considered the above percentages to be reasonable. (3) Among the expenditures of Shanghai Electric Power Company, there is a type of fee called a consulting fee, in English known as EBASCO. It is said to be paid by the company to its American headquarters for liaison and cooperation purposes. For example, when Shanghai Electric Power Company needs to purchase materials, it can entrust the headquarters to handle it. Regarding this consulting fee and the exchange rate for salaries paid in US dollars, committee member Li Wenjie hoped that the company would report on it at the next meeting. (4) In the company's accounts, there is an item called the "military external reserve fund," which is a significant amount. According to the company, due to the drastic changes in currency value in the past, it was necessary to assume a number to guard against the depreciation of the legal tender. This is what is meant by "paying in advance," but it is not actually used.</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu declared that since the government reformed the currency system, the cost of living index has been abolished, and foreign exchange can be considered stable, then the crisis of public utility price increases can also be eliminated, expressing optimism about the future. The committee did not complete the review of Shanghai Electric Power Company's accounts at yesterday's meeting and resolved to convene the third meeting at 3:00 PM next Monday to review the review work. Company representatives may not be invited. If necessary, the company will be asked to submit income and expenditure statistics and other forms for review purposes.</p>
<h3>Doctor Flees to Shanghai, Builds House on Cemetery Land, Sued</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Dai Zhihe, a doctor from Yancheng, recently fled to Shanghai because his hometown was troubled by bandits. Finding no place to live, on the twelfth of last month, he found an ownerless cemetery plot at the corner of Dapu Bridge and Xietu Road. He invested in building a house, which resulted in the digging up and destruction of coffins on the ground, with scattered bones all over the place.

<h3>Accident with Motorboat on Huangpu River, Passengers and Sailors Safe</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The motorboats of the Hezhong Motorboat Company are specially used for the convenience of merchants traveling on the Huangpu River (equivalent to taxis on land). They have a station kiosk on the Bund of Jiujiang Road. At 9:30 AM yesterday, several Chinese staff members of the Damei Shipping Company went to the kiosk to hire a boat to go to the ship docked at buoy number 42. The station sent motorboat number 2, which started its engine and sailed out. The engine of the boat originally burned both gasoline and diesel. It started with gasoline and then switched to diesel after starting. When the boat sailed into the river, it was about to switch fuels, but the diesel pipe was blocked. As it was about to switch back to gasoline, a spark fell into the gasoline, and it immediately caught fire. For a time, the flames were raging. Fortunately, the Customs and Port Fire Brigade was nearby. Upon seeing the fire, they immediately dispatched the Puji fireboat to extinguish it. It was extinguished in about a quarter of an hour. The passengers and sailors were rescued by nearby sampans, and fortunately, there were no injuries. Apart from the wooden shed being burned, the losses to the motorboat were minimal.</p>

<h3>Talking about Siming with its Thousands of Peaks and Ridges</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>A newly established fourth-class county in Zhejiang is realized in the mountainous area of "six not governed"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 20th] On August 11th, the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference approved the establishment of Siming County in Zhejiang Province. The long-pending issue of setting up Siming County since the restoration has finally been realized.</p>
<p>Siming County is located between the six counties of Yuyao, Shangyu, Cixi, Yinxian, Fenghua, and Shengxian in eastern Zhejiang. It is a mountainous area centered on Siming Mountain. The main purpose of setting up the county is to facilitate public security and administrative management. This mountainous area is far from the county seats, with thousands of peaks and ridges and inconvenient transportation. Even in peaceful times, bandits often appeared. During the War of Resistance, after the "April 18th" fall of Ningbo, this area became a haven for wandering troops. After the victory, bandits used the gap of "six not governed" as their base of operations. The Zhejiang Provincial Government, aware of this, resolved to establish the county in the provincial administrative conference in the winter of 1945, and dispatched special commissioners to conduct on-site surveys and propose opinions. In September 1946, in order to clear the bandits in this border area, a bandit suppression headquarters was set up in Lianghong, and the Siming Pacification Office was established to actively promote the establishment of the county.</p>
<p>New County Area</p>
<p>According to the provincial government's plan, the area of Siming County includes the six townships of Zuoxi, Yaxian, Xiaoyun, Rangxian, Bailu, and Nanlan, and Lianghong Town, originally belonging to Yuyao; parts of the two townships of Donghe and Xiaguan and the two townships of Daze and Cennan, originally belonging to Shangyu; the two townships of Wulian and Xiehe, originally belonging to Shengxian; most of the two townships of Shanmin and Shanhhou, originally belonging to Fenghua; Nanshan Township and Lubu Town, and parts of the two townships of Chejiu and Dayin, originally belonging to Cixi; and the four townships of Zhangxi, Dajiao, Zhangmi, and Longhe, and parts of the four townships of Yinghu, Wuling, Meiyuan, and Yinzhang, originally belonging to Yinxian. The entire county consists of 27 townships and towns, 220 bao, 2,894 jia, 37,943 households, and 155,318 people. The area is 1,079.226 square kilometers, with an average of 144 people per square kilometer.</p>
<p>Four Holes in the Mountains</p>
<p>The Siming Mountain range originates from Tiantai, and its main mountain is Shichuang Mountain (also known as Huogai Mountain), located at the former junction of the four counties of Yuyao, Fenghua, Shengxian, and Shangyu. Because there is a huge rock on the southwest hillside of Shichuang Mountain with four holes in the rock, shaped like windows, called Shichuang, it is named after the windows, hence the name Siming Mountain. Since Siming County is located in the mountainous area, transportation is greatly affected. Land transportation is centered on Lianghong, passing through Youta Mountain and Qingxian Ridge to reach Yuyao. Northeast, it passes through Gaodi Ridge, exits Longkeng, passes Nanmiao, and reaches Yuyao (that is, Yu-Liang Highway). Northwest, it passes Huangzhu Ridge to Shangyu (that is, Yu-Bai Highway). The ancient road is centered on Qingtinggang, which can reach all directions, but it is very dangerous. Water transportation can only use bamboo rafts. The upper reaches of the Yaojiang River originate from Yang'e Ridge in the southern part of the county, pass through Lianghong Baziqiao to Jiangkou, forming the Simingjiang River. The rivers branching from Jiangkou can reach Tongmingba in the suburbs of Shangyu, and its main stream merges with the Yaojiang River, passing through Ningbo to reach the sea, with small ships coming and going for transportation. Most of the county is mountainous streams, which can only be used to transport bamboo rafts and cannot be considered water transportation. Aware of this, the provincial government had already opened the Yu-Liang and Yu-Bai (Baiguan) highways, but due to limited funding, they have not yet been completed. The provincial government has set a deadline for completion by the end of this year. In addition, due to the needs of bandit suppression military affairs, the provincial government plans to build four highways centered on the future new county seat - Qingtinggang - to connect the entire mountainous area. One starts from Yinjiang Bridge in Yinxian, passes through Dajiao, to Qingtinggang. One starts from Fenghua, passes through Tingxia or Xikou, Tangtian, and reaches Qingtinggang. One starts from Shengxian, passes through Baizhuang (that is, Beiwei), and reaches Qingtinggang. It is currently being carried out by the Highway Bureau.</p>
<p>Special Products</p>
<p>Since the entire county is mountainous, only the northeastern part has a slight plain. The arable land is less than 200,000 mu, accounting for only one-eightieth of the total area. The produced rice and miscellaneous grains are not enough to support themselves, and food is even more scarce in the southern part. The main products are bamboo, wood, firewood, charcoal, local paper, tea, and bamboo shoots. The mountain people rely entirely on these mountain goods to exchange for a small amount of rice and food, living a difficult life. In addition, fritillaria thunbergii from Zhangmi Township and silkworm silk, and ginkgo from Dajiao Township are considered special products. Commerce is most prosperous in Lianghong in southern Yuyao, which is the center of trade in the mountainous area, followed by the three markets of Dajiao, Xiaguan, and Zhangzhen, and then Shanling Village and Zhongcun. Lianghong is not only the most prosperous in commerce, but also has the largest population, with more than 1,000 households, making it the largest town in the area. During the period of occupation, it was once occupied by the "35th Detachment of the New Fourth Army" and was called the "Yan'an of Eastern Zhejiang." Currently, it is the political and military center of the Siming Mountain area, and is called the command post of Siming Mountain, and will also be the location of the temporary Siming County seat.</p>
<p>The economic foundation of Siming is so weak, and the difficulty of the county's finances can be imagined. However, the responsibility it bears - public security - is so important. Currently, in order to deal with four or five hundred bandits, there are pacification funds available for allocation. In the future, to maintain such a fourth-class county, it must be subsidized by the provincial finances.</p>
<h3>Haikou Shilu Mine Plans to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Annual Production of Two Million Tons Possible in Five Years</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Haikou, 21st] Shilu Mine recently formulated a five-year production increase plan, which is expected to complete the unfinished mining projects left by the Japanese in Shilu and Bali by 1949. It is planned to produce 600,000 tons of ore in 1950, 1 million tons of ore in 1951, 1.5 million tons of ore in 1952, and 2 million tons of ore in 1953. According to the mine manager, Yuan Chaoyun, if the public security situation is good and there are no financial difficulties, this five-year plan can definitely be realized. As for the amount of ore produced by the Tiandu Mine this year, it is expected to be 250,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Severe Floods in Xikang</h3>
<p>The Council Elects to Petition the Central Government for Tax Relief</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Ya'an, 11th by Air] For several months, Maobian has been in the rainy season, which has hindered the growth of all crops. The rainfall has been even heavier this week, with mountain floods breaking out. Not only have the bridges and roadbeds of all highways been washed away, disrupting transportation, but the fields and houses along the mountains have also been submerged by the floodwaters, resulting in heavy losses. Various counties have reported disasters and requested relief, and have also telegraphed the central government to reduce or exempt taxes and corvée, and to exempt accumulated grain in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Establishes Committee to Hold County Magistrate Examination</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei, 18th] In order to improve the personnel system, the Anhui Provincial Government has established a Personnel Committee, with incumbent government committee members serving as members. All newly appointed county magistrates, provincial principals, education bureau chiefs, county land commissioners, and tax collection bureau chiefs will be reviewed by the committee before being examined and then appointed. The county magistrate examination was held on the 18th, with 129 participants. It is expected that there will be a large number of transfers of county magistrates in Anhui Province. It is reported that only nine of the 129 participants passed the review.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Officer Luo Zhongzhen Arrested in Wanxian for Carrying Morphine in his Pocket, Attempting to Destroy Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 21st] Luo Zhongzhen, an air force mechanical officer who studied in the United States, recently requested leave to return to Sichuan from Nanjing. The Wanxian County Government, acting on a confidential report that he was carrying a large amount of morphine, sent a township head to follow him. A large package was found in Luo's pocket. Luo immediately tried to destroy the evidence, resulting in a scuffle. After being arrested, one tael of morphine was still found. Qian Zuoyi, the county magistrate, immediately sent the details and the drugs to Chongqing. On the 21st, the Sui Jing Headquarters received a report from the Chongqing Health Bureau confirming that it was morphine and immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Qian, ordering him to escort Luo to the Fifth Air Force District in Chongqing for interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Complete Picture of Forestry in Taiwan: A Glimmer of Hope Amidst Crisis</h3>
<p>— Bo Ying</p>
<p>[Our Tainan Correspondent, 18th Dispatch] Taiwan's forests cover almost the entire island, their verdant lushness a beautiful sight. Indeed, the name "Formosa" (originally meaning "Beautiful Island") originates from this. The reasons for the flourishing of its forests can be attributed to several factors: (1) The towering Mount Yu (formerly known as Mount Niitaka), reaching approximately 3,000 meters in altitude, runs vertically through the island, with its branches crisscrossing east and west, resulting in more mountains than fields, thus facilitating tree growth. (2) Taiwan's steep terrain and intense winds necessitate dense forests to secure the soil, prevent erosion, and mitigate wind damage. (3) The rugged mountainous terrain, with its precipitous ravines and overhanging cliffs, makes human passage inconvenient, further hindering timber transportation, thereby preserving forest accumulation. (4) Taiwan's advantageous geographical conditions straddle both tropical and temperate zones, and considering the overall climate, its high mountains result in cold, warm, temperate, and hot climate zones. For example, during my recent inspection of various forest areas in the west, I visited Mount Ali. While boarding the train in Chiayi in the early morning, it was still the height of summer's sweltering heat, but by evening, I had to huddle around a fire for warmth in the mountains. Mount Ali only stands at an altitude of 2,275 meters. If one were to ascend Mount Yu, exceeding 3,000 meters, it would naturally be even colder. Moreover, the island's location in the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by sea on all sides, provides ample moisture, which is conducive to plant growth and supports a rich variety of tree species. Furthermore, during Japan's 50-year rule over Taiwan, the country leveraged its advanced forestry technology and experience, investing significant capital and actively managing the forests. Consequently, the island's forestry industry became remarkably prosperous, second only to agriculture and industry in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Evil Wind of Deforestation</p>
<p>Currently, Taiwan's forests can be considered the largest forest region in the entire country. According to the 1937 Taiwan Forestry Statistics, the forest area spans 1,859,000 hectares. The soil in many of these areas is composed of highly erodible slate. Without forests to conserve soil and water, whenever typhoons and torrential rains occur, topsoil is lost, and sand and gravel are carried away by the floods, inundating fields, breaching dikes, and causing considerable damage. For example, the devastating floods in Taichung and Luodong last year were the direct result of the near-complete deforestation of the upstream forests. During my time in Taiwan, I saw slogans everywhere proclaiming "Forests are the lifeblood of Taiwan" and "Without forests, there is no Taiwan." This is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The Japanese were originally very conscientious in managing Taiwan's forestry, paying close attention to forest protection and regulation. Forest fires and illegal logging were rare. They were also willing to invest substantial funds in reforestation projects, maintaining a balance between logging and planting, which led to an ideal state of management. However, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to the urgent need for materials, large-scale logging was implemented, and reforestation efforts came to a halt. Subsequently, as the war turned unfavorable, the Japanese, desperate for victory, intensified their deforestation efforts. Even now, a considerable amount of logged timber remains piled up in the mountains, left uncollected and exposed to rain and sun, gradually decaying. After the restoration, the handling of takeover affairs was not ideal, and organizational mergers and personnel maladjustments created obstacles. As a result, the phenomena of deforestation and arson were not only not curbed but also exacerbated. Although the authorities repeatedly issued orders and proclaimed prohibitions, all efforts were in vain. This type of illegal logging is not merely the work of one or two individuals felling a few trees but rather an organized and planned operation with financial and influential backing. There were cases of masterminds behind illegal logging being arrested and sent to court, only to be released on bail shortly afterward, demonstrating their extensive connections. This is indeed the biggest obstacle to Taiwan's forestry today.</p>
<p>During the Japanese occupation, Taiwan's forestry administration was under the jurisdiction of the Forestry Division of the Governor-General's Office of Agriculture and Commerce. The organizational structure was divided into four sections: General Affairs, Forestry Policy, Forest Products, and Forestry Affairs, overseeing all forestry matters throughout Taiwan. After the restoration, the Forestry Bureau under the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Chief Executive Office took over. Now, it has been reorganized into the Forest Products Management Bureau under the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Provincial Government, unifying the functions of forestry management and operational agencies. The Forest Management Offices have also been placed under the jurisdiction of the Forest Products Management Bureau. Under the Forest Products Management Bureau, there are currently six forest areas: Alishan Forest Area, Baxianshan Forest Area, Taipingshan Forest Area, Zhudong Forest Area, Luantashan Forest Area, and Taroko Forest Area. The first three are larger in scale and better equipped, inheriting the larger-scale Japanese government-operated logging operations. I recently visited four forest areas in the west: Alishan, Baxianshan, Zhudong, and Luantashan. Here, I will briefly describe my observations:</p>
<p>The Five Woods of Alishan</p>
<p>Alishan is located in central Taiwan, on a northwestern branch of the Mount Yu Range, situated at 23.5 degrees north latitude, the Tropic of Cancer. It spans eight kilometers east-west and twenty kilometers north-south, covering an area of 10,032 hectares, with an altitude ranging from 924 meters to 2,800 meters. Due to the vertical climate, it possesses four distinct vegetation zones: warm, temperate, cold, and tropical. The timber reserves include: 374,230 coniferous trees, with a volume of 2,952,834 cubic meters; and 1,112,186 broadleaf trees, with a volume of 3,129,978 cubic meters. These are virgin forests that have thrived for thousands of years without being touched by axes. Due to their age, they yield abundant high-quality timber, such as the renowned Five Woods of Alishan: red cypress, Formosan white pine, Taiwan hemlock, Taiwania, and cypress. Among these, cypress is a world-renowned timber. For example, the famous Sacred Tree is a 3,000-year-old red cypress, 53 meters in height and 34.3 meters in circumference (scientific name: Chamaecyparis Formosensis Mats.). (See attached photo.) Countless other trees require several people to encircle them, with diameters at breast height reaching 4.5 meters. The Japanese, enticed by the abundance and quality of the timber, conducted surveys, explorations, and planning, investing a total of 6,090,000 Japanese yen from the 31st year of the Meiji era (1898) to the 44th year of the Meiji era (1911). They constructed a 70-kilometer-long timber railway from Chiayi City, meandering through thousands of mountains and valleys, winding through rugged cliffs. From the foot of the mountain to the summit, it rises approximately 2,300 meters in elevation, with over fifty mountain tunnels along the entire route. According to Mr. Zhang Yufeng, director of the Alishan Mountain Branch of the Forest Area, the longest tunnel is 800 meters long, which gives an idea of the vastness and difficulty of the project. Beside the Alpine Museum on the mountain, we saw a monument to Dr. Kawai Kinsen, a Japanese engineer. It is said to commemorate his death during the inaugural run of the timber railway when he was inspecting the train and was decapitated while leaning out of the train in a tunnel. The log-gathering equipment here uses the American Western aerial cableway method because the trees being harvested are very large, and ordinary methods are not suitable. This method can transport any giant tree within a 2,600-meter radius to a station near the railway for loading onto trains. The forest area still uses this special log-gathering machine (see attached photo), but the future supply of equipment has become a significant issue.</p>
<p>Baxianshan in Fengyuan</p>
<p>Baxianshan is located in Fengyuan, Taichung, spanning 15.7 kilometers east-west and 11.8 kilometers north-south, with an area of 16,422 hectares, larger than Alishan. However, the total timber reserves are only 2,850,815 cubic meters. A 60-kilometer-long timber railway runs from Fengyuan to Jiabao Terrace, and then lumber cars and cableways are used to transport timber further up. The lumber cars are older equipment, and the logging in the old mountain area above is nearly exhausted. This part of the operation will end after August of this year. The cableway leads to the new mountain area, which is a burgeoning logging area. However, the cableway's steel cables used to be replaced every three months, but now they have not been replaced for a year. Therefore, Mr. Meng Chuanlou, director of the Baxianshan Forest Area, has banned passenger cars on the cableway due to concerns about accidents caused by the old cables. However, employees still need to travel up and down for work, so they risk riding on empty lumber cars and riding down on timber, which is even more dangerous. If an accident occurs on the cableway, not only will the employees' lives be unprotected, but repairs will be difficult, and no timber will be able to come down the mountain. Therefore, if this equipment problem is not resolved, not to mention increasing production, it is feared that the operation will soon face a shutdown crisis.</p>
<p>Zhudong Forest Area, etc.</p>
<p>The Zhudong and Luantashan Forest Areas are smaller in scale, and I did not ascend the mountains for inspection. However, I know that the Zhudong Forest Area covers the entire Luchang Mountain and the Xiangshan Mountain, Pulowan, Mayimalai, Tengdana, and Shuitian mountain areas, totaling approximately 11,530 hectares, with timber reserves of approximately 1,050,000 cubic meters. However, Luchang Mountain, the largest area with the richest reserves, was only brought under direct management in April of this year, so everything is still being organized. If the equipment is adequate, transportation tools are increased, and roads and bridges are repaired, then future production can gradually increase to 1,400 cubic meters per month. The Luantashan Forest Area's current operations are limited to Wangxiang Mountain. It is named Luantashan Forest Area in the hope of developing the virgin forests of Greater Luanta in the future. Therefore, the current total forest area is only 150 hectares, and there is only one operating forest section. In 1947, the total volume of virgin forest harvested was 13,000 cubic meters, the volume of timber transported was 8,248 cubic meters, and the volume of timber processed was 4,537 cubic meters. From January to March 1948, the total volume of virgin forest harvested was 1,138 cubic meters, the volume of timber transported was 1,768 cubic meters, and the volume of timber processed was 973 cubic meters.</p>
<p>Impressions After the Visit</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to visit these rare and prominent forest areas in the Far East and conduct on-site inspections. I gained a lot of information and realized that the Japanese had made indelible contributions to the technical aspects of forestry development, which should serve as a wake-up call for us. However, their wartime deforestation, their tolerance of people burning forests, and their destruction caused immense damage to our national vitality and had a profound impact on national land security, which is infuriating. What is even more disheartening is that after the restoration, the Chinese who took over were unable to develop the industry and instead allowed it to deteriorate, which is deeply regrettable. It is undeniable that Taiwan's forestry is facing a severe crisis. Due to over-logging and illegal logging, the nearby forests have been almost completely depleted, and in a few years, they will be gone. Currently, there is only harvesting without reforestation. Every tree cut is one less tree. Conversely, to talk about reforestation, we must first protect the forests, and the primary task of protecting the forests is to reduce and prohibit over-logging and illegal logging. Moreover, the purpose of reforestation is not just timber production; it is primarily to conserve soil and water, replenish water sources, and regulate the climate. However, to achieve "using forests to support forests" without relying on external forces, we must also talk about timber production. Therefore, only by achieving a balance between harvesting and planting can forestry be permanently sustainable. However, due to the damage done in recent years and the current constraints, talking about a balance between harvesting and planting may be premature.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a shortage of transportation equipment, which has almost reached a dead end. In addition to the situation with the Baxianshan cableway mentioned above, for example, many of the rails on the Alishan railway have been worn down on one side, and many bridges and tunnels have deteriorated. Of the forty locomotives, only six are usable, and all of them are over thirty years old. Currently, there is no possibility of replacing them, and even a complete overhaul would be too expensive. Now, we can only treat the symptoms as they arise and repair the most essential parts first. As a result, the reduced transportation capacity has hindered production and contributed to the decline of forestry.</p>
<p>In addition to these problems, the undesirable practices brought from the mainland have gradually spread in Taiwan. For example, internal personnel disputes in the forest areas have become increasingly complex, affecting the handling of official business and administrative efficiency. A clear example of this is the recent resignation of Mr. Fu Xian, director of the Alishan Forest Area, due to his inability to cope with the obstruction of his subordinates. (See the August 2nd issue of the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News.)</p>
<p>The First Glimmer of Dawn</p>
<p>Although forestry is currently facing numerous difficulties and a bleak future, human effort can make a difference. Seeing this, the responsible officials of Taiwan's forestry agencies are striving to reverse the decline, giving a glimmer of hope to the future of forestry, which is commendable. Furthermore, the local press is keenly aware of the critical importance of the forestry industry to Taiwan's lifeline and is raising timely appeals, which is encouraging. For example, while I was at Jiabao Terrace in Baxianshan, I happened to meet a Taipei press delegation visiting the forestry area. When I returned from my tour in the south, the Taipei newspapers had already published reports on the forestry visit, which were generally accurate in identifying the current problems and revealing the root causes of the difficulties in forestry. It is hoped that this will draw the attention of the public and lead to a collective effort to solve the problems and restore the prosperity of forestry. This will not only benefit the six million people of Taiwan but also serve the long-term interests of the nation. It is indeed a matter of urgency.</p>
<h3>National Tax Bureau Downsizes, Stirring Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Correspondent, 19th Dispatch] The Direct Commodity and Business Tax Bureau of this county was merged into the National Tax Bureau, with Sun Mingxiu, the former director of the Commodity Tax Bureau, as the director. After Sun took office, he laid off a large number of personnel from the former Business Tax Bureau, which lacked fairness and reasonableness, arousing resentment among some of the laid-off employees. They repeatedly asked the director to explain the criteria for retention and dismissal, but to no avail. On the 19th, a large number of inflammatory slogans suddenly appeared in the Tieshi Lane area of the bureau. Director Sun immediately reported the matter to the city defense department and hired photographers to take numerous photos. Meanwhile, the laid-off employees' association declared that the slogans were entirely the result of a conspiracy, hoping to divert attention and evade responsibility.</p>

<h3>Shocking Murder Case in Lanzhou: Fugitive Arrested; Wang Wenxuan and His Four Brothers Stabbed; One Dead, Two Injured; Bizarre Details</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Correspondent, 19th Dispatch] At around 11:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month, on a rainy, dimly lit night, a shocking murder case occurred at No. 212 Zuogong East Road in Lanzhou, resulting in one death and three injuries. The murderer escaped over the wall after committing the crime. After more than a week of investigation by the criminal police team, he was finally apprehended on the 15th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Wenxuan, a Shanxi native, worked as a driver in the air force in Kunming during the Anti-Japanese War, where he met You Shoufang, a soldier from Luoyang, Henan. During the golden age of the Burma Road, Wang accumulated some savings and bought two trucks to transport goods in the southwest. His third brother, Wang Wenyi, and fourth brother, Wang Wenzhao, also worked as truck drivers. Two years ago, Wang Wenxuan's family moved to Xi'an, where You Shoufang was also stationed. The two remained on good terms. Recently, Wang Wenxuan's family came to Lanzhou to run a transportation company, and You Shoufang followed them to Lanzhou. Initially, he stayed at Wang's home, but at the beginning of this month, he moved to a certain hotel. At around 10:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month, You Shoufang went to Wang's home again and chatted with Wenxuan over tea. An hour later, Wang Wenxuan went to the toilet to urinate. You Shoufang suddenly jumped out from behind and repeatedly stabbed him with a triangular scraper used for repairing cars. Wenxuan shouted for help! His fourth brother, Wenli, came out to investigate after hearing the noise and was met by You with a knife that struck him in the left chest, causing him to collapse to the ground. The third brother, Wenyi, and the second brother, Wenzhong, rushed to rescue him but were also stabbed. After 12:00 a.m., Wang Wenyi's son, Niansheng, called the police. The police rushed the injured to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment. At 3:00 a.m. on the 9th, Wang Wenli died of his injuries, as the knife had pierced his heart. Wang Wenxuan was stabbed in seven places on his chest and back and was also in a coma for a time. The other two had three to five stab wounds each, but they were not in critical areas and were not in life-threatening danger.</p>
<p>The deceased, Wang Wenli, was originally scheduled to get married on the 15th of this month. Unfortunately, he met with a sudden and tragic death and was buried on the 11th. However, the reason for You Shoufang's actions is widely speculated, but the mystery has not been solved. The local security authorities have ordered the criminal police team to solve the case within a week. Detectives were dispatched everywhere, but there were still no results as of the evening of the 14th.</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month, the murderer, You Shoufang, was finally arrested by the criminal police team at No. 21 Yanshou Lane. It is said that he was almost able to escape. The reporter visited this "murderous demon" at the criminal police team at 7:00 p.m. that day, but You Shoufang looked like a student, wearing a yellow khaki shirt, with a dark complexion and a neat appearance. He only looked dejected and showed no signs of ferocity. According to his confession to the criminal police team, the motive for his actions was that when he and Wang Wenxuan were in Xi'an, Wang entrusted him to take care of his wife, Hu Qizhen. However, Wang then had a close relationship with a Chen woman who ran a pharmacy. Wang Wenxuan originally planned to take over Chen's pharmacy and divorce his wife, Hu Qizhen. He also asked his old supervisor, Zheng Paifu, to tell You Shoufang that he would abandon Hu Qizhen and remarry her to You Shoufang. You initially felt that it was against his principles and did not agree, but later Hu Qizhen had no means of support, so You provided her with assistance. The two began living together informally.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, Wang Wenxuan's relationship with the Chen woman deteriorated, and his plan to take over the pharmacy failed. So, he returned to Hu Qizhen and came to Lanzhou together. Out of anger, You followed them to Lanzhou, but he did not quarrel with Wang and the others. You Shoufang recently lost his job and was struggling financially. He even stayed in Wang's garage for a time and asked Wang's brothers to help him find a job. Seeing You's destitution, the Wang family changed their previously warm attitude. You became angry and moved out.</p>
<p>The Wang brothers not only did not help You find a job, but they also threatened to throw him into a well. On the night of the 8th, You Shoufang came to Wang's home in the rain to ask for help finding a job. They quarreled, and You finally felt that Wang Wenxuan was too ungrateful, so he decided to hurt Wang Wenxuan. After one stab, the Wang brothers came to his rescue one after another. You Shoufang was afraid that they would be unfavorable to him, so he stabbed all four of them. After the incident, You fled the city at night and hid in Shuibu River in Gaolan North Township. He came into the city to listen to the news on the 15th and was immediately arrested. The police have now transferred the suspect and the murder weapon to the local court, and a public prosecution will be initiated within days.</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Purpose and Means — A Word for Those Who Disregard Means —</h3>
<p>Political struggles are often not struggles between purpose and purpose, but merely struggles between means and means. Political victory is also often not a victory of purpose itself, but merely a victory of means itself; "The victor is king, the vanquished is bandit." This success or failure determines whether someone is king or bandit, but a person's purpose need not be to aim to be a bandit. What drives someone to success or failure often lies not in their purpose, but in their means. In terms of purpose, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu's purposes may not have been different, both could be said to have aimed to resist the tyrannical Qin! At the very least, that was their slogan. However, Liu Bang succeeded and Xiang Yu failed because their means were different. One entered the pass and did not disturb the chickens or dogs, and did not commit the slightest offense; the other buried Qin soldiers and burned Xianyang. This benevolence or violence in means, coupled with intelligence or stupidity in means, was the main cause of Liu and Xiang's success or failure. The history of success and failure of all emperors and other political fighters in our history can mostly be viewed in this way. This is the most obvious fact in history, and there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>What does this obvious fact tell us? What lessons can we learn from this fact? The first lesson is that the end does not justify the means. The righteousness of the end does not equate to the righteousness of the means, which is common knowledge and beyond doubt. Can using unjust means to achieve a just end make the unjust means just? That is the question. In fact, we often use unjust means to achieve just ends. We often use deception to entice children to take medicine, and we also often use deception to interrogate criminals and make them confess. We sympathize with those who kill for revenge. We not only sympathize with soldiers who kill and deceive while fighting the enemy, but also praise them. There are countless similar acts. Does this not mean that if the end is just, the means become just as well? As for those who advocate "only care about the end, regardless of the means": this may be their theoretical basis. However, this theoretical basis is not strong. Firstly, we do not recognize the above examples as common practice, that is, we do not recognize that the above means can be universally applied. We only recognize that in certain special circumstances, the above means are permissible. Secondly, in special circumstances, although we allow the above means, we do not regard the above means as just. In order to induce children to take medicine or to induce criminals to confess, we allow the use of deception, but we still condemn this means itself. We will never sympathize with this means itself. What we sympathize with is the end, not the means. The law does not allow killing for revenge, and that is why. Modern people regard war itself as illegal, and that is also why. It can be seen that a just end does not make the means just. This is the case in any situation. In any situation, the end cannot make the means just. Unjust means are always unjust means, and do not become just because of their relationship with a just end. The righteousness or injustice of an act has another standard, and cannot be determined solely by the end. If the righteousness or injustice of an act is determined solely by the end, not only are human ends latent and difficult to know, making judgment difficult, but even if they are known, the distinction between just and unjust will disappear completely. If theft is aimed at survival, we cannot say that "seeking survival" is an unjust end. Does the act of theft also become just along with this end? If the means become just along with the end, then there may be no unjust means in the world.</p>
<p>The second lesson is that unjust means can destroy a just end. The end cannot make the means just, but when the means are unjust, the end is often affected. We all know that the end is latent, hidden deep within the human heart. Modern science excludes the concept of "end" because this concept is obscure and difficult to experience. We cannot directly perceive someone's end, we can only measure their end through their actions and means. This measurement can of course be wrong, so unjust means do not necessarily reflect an unjust end. However, apart from this method of measurement and inference, we have no other way to directly know the ends of others. Expressions of ends in language and writing do not necessarily express the inner ends of someone. This can be faked. Conversely, the use of means or the expression of actions can better reflect someone's inner ends. Therefore, when someone's means are unjust, we suspect that their ends are also unjust. This is very natural and also has a basis. If we have a just end, we must not use unjust means, otherwise our end can easily be mistaken for unjust, and it will be difficult for us to prove that it is just. Secondly, unjust means can sometimes achieve just ends, but they often destroy just ends. There are many such examples. For example, filial piety to parents is certainly a just end. But if theft is used as a means, it will usually destroy this end. Another example is patriotism, or increasing the glory of the nation, which is an end that we consider just. Under this end, the use of unjust means is usually permitted by us. But didn't the deceptive and aggressive means used by dictators and militarists in countries such as Germany and Japan destroy their ends? According to the current situation, even in dealings between countries, unjust means cannot be used to achieve so-called just ends. The behavior of deception and aggression will eventually bear its own fruit.</p>
<p>The third lesson is that in politics, it is only possible to win through means, and it is difficult to win through ends. This does not deny the importance of ends. Ends are certainly important in politics. We certainly need to have lofty and just ends. However, political struggles are rarely struggles between ends and ends. At the very least, on the surface, the ends proposed by each other are rarely conflicting. Taking dictatorship and democracy as examples, they are undoubtedly two extremely opposite political systems, but the difference lies not in their public ends. In terms of public ends, dictators must believe that their ends are the same as those of democracy, that is, to seek the welfare of the people. Of course, we can deny that the dictator's ends are not like this, but the basis for our denial is the means used by the dictator. We say that their ends are not democratic because the means used by the dictator are undemocratic. When dictators use deception and oppression of the people as means, we cannot believe their so-called end of "seeking the welfare of the people." In this way, the failure of dictators, regardless of their ends, is actually a failure of means. Therefore, the British scholar Ernest Barker believes that the difference between democracy and dictatorship lies mainly in the means and not in the end. Free democracy is "more concerned with the method of government than with its purpose - more concerned with the process of government than with its goal." It is generally believed that politics is playing tricks with means. In a sense, this is true. But the only condition is that we have to play just means, and we cannot play unjust means. Playing unjust means, even if it can achieve temporary victory, will eventually fail. The tragedy of politics can be said to be the tragedy of neglecting means, the tragedy of neglecting that means must be just and only seeking that the end is just.</p>
<p>The above three lessons are very obvious. The reason why the author specifically raises them here is because people currently engaged in political activities in our country neglect means too much. They are always engaged in political struggles under the false principle of "only caring about the end, regardless of the means." Their ends may be just, but their means are often unjust. In order to achieve a certain end, they can collude with groups that betray the interests of the country and the nation, they can also contact bandits and robbers, and they can cooperate with vile politicians or warlords. In short, they will use any of the most unjust means. They seem to aim to achieve democracy, but they use the most undemocratic means. They seem to aim at the welfare of the people, but they only use the people as tools and means. They have forgotten the famous saying of the German philosopher Kant - that is, "Treat humanity, in any case, as an end, and never merely as a means." This famous saying is actually the element of democratic politics. They do not know that if they do not choose means, the people can also become a means. Once they use the people as a means, they destroy their own end and destroy the spirit of democratic politics. Democratic politics never allows the people to be used only as a means. Everything can be only a means, but humanity itself cannot be only a means. If humanity is only used as a means, then there is no way to talk about the so-called end. But "not choosing means" will inevitably lead to using humanity as a means. In this way, all evils are done under the principle of "not exploring means." The chaos in the current situation in China is the responsibility of these people who talk glibly about democracy but do not choose means. History teaches that those who do not choose means will always fail. This is what the author cannot help but say to warn them.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of Silver and Money Industries Sets Internal Precautions for Firms: All Assets and Transactions Calculated in Gold Yuan; Starting September 1st, Legal Tender Checks Will No Longer Be Accepted</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] After the government implemented currency reform, regarding the precautions that should be taken in banking operations, in addition to the National Bank having already drafted concise guidelines and notified the financial industry in this city on the 20th to review and implement, the financial industry believes that there is a need for more detailed regulations on various technical issues involved in internal and external dealings within these concise guidelines. A joint meeting of the silver, money, and trust industries was convened at the Bankers Association yesterday morning starting at 10:00 AM, presided over by Li Fuxun, Chairman of the Bankers Association, attended by more than 30 people including Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Xu Jilun. As a result of the discussion, nine "Internal Precautions for Banks Regarding Currency Reform" were passed to supplement the shortcomings of the concise guidelines set by the National Bank. These precautions have been distributed to member firms of each association for review and consistent implementation. The full text of the "Internal Precautions for Banks Regarding Currency Reform" is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) As of August 20, 1948, all bank claims, debts, and accounting balances shall be calculated at a rate of 3,000,000 Legal Tender to 1 Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>(2) For accounting convenience, assets such as bank capital, reserve funds, real estate, and marketable securities shall also be temporarily converted into Gold Yuan at the same ratio. Adjustments will be made after separate measures are drafted and approved by the government.</p>
<p>(3) When converting amounts in account books and passbooks, the rubber stamp "Converted to Gold Yuan at the Legal Rate" shall be used.</p>
<p>(4) Legal Tender instruments issued before August 31, 1948, that are entrusted to banks for collection by customers, shall be stamped by the collecting bank with a horizontal rubber stamp "Converted to Gold Yuan," indicating the Arabic Gold Yuan amount, and submitted for exchange. Starting September 1st, checks issued by customers that are still denominated in Legal Tender will no longer be accepted. Those seeking to cash checks at the paying bank should be asked to exchange them for Gold Yuan checks before payment can be made. (This measure slightly modifies Item 4, Section A of the Central Bank's Telegraphic Circular No. 3013, and will be filed with the Central Bank and publicly announced in the newspapers.) The rubber stamp mentioned above should be applied below the amount on Chinese checks and above the Arabic numerals on English checks.</p>
<p>(5) Remittance advices and receipts (both original and duplicate) that should have been sent before August 20 but have not yet been issued shall be sent by the paying bank after first converting the amount to Gold Yuan at the specified ratio.</p>
<p>(6) Current deposits and overdrafts shall be settled at the interest rates announced by the Bankers Association on August 19 before August 20. (Deposit interest rate: 2.3 yuan per thousand; overdraft interest rate: 14 yuan per thousand; interbank day loan rate: 12 yuan per thousand.) Fixed deposit interest rates shall continue to be calculated according to the original agreement. Deposits with semi-annual interest payments shall be calculated at the original agreed interest rate before August 20. Subsequent interest rates shall be determined by each bank.</p>
<p>(7) Pre-war deposits in banks that have not yet been entered into the accounts according to the settlement regulations shall be temporarily converted into Gold Yuan at a rate of 3 million to 1 based on the original Legal Tender amount. However, the original currency amount must be noted in the remarks column, and amounts less than one Gold Yuan cent after conversion shall also be counted as one cent. When depositors come to claim their deposits, they will still be converted and repaid according to the settlement regulations based on the original Legal Tender account books.</p>
<p>(8) Unused checks issued by banks in the future that are printed with the words "National Currency" should have the words "Gold Yuan" stamped immediately below the words "National Currency." Customers who write checks must also add the words "Gold Yuan" below "National Currency" and must not write the words "Gold Yuan" next to "National Currency" or cross out "National Currency." If this type of writing exists, the original seal should be used to certify it. (This point concerning customers should be announced separately.)</p>
<p>(9) New contracts or documents issued by banks to customers that require stamp duties should still use Legal Tender stamp tax tickets, converted to Gold Yuan at the specified ratio, before the tax bureau makes any changes.</p>
<h3>National Bank Notifies Designated Banks of New Foreign Exchange Settlement Regulations: Export Settlements Will No Longer Issue Settlement Certificates</h3>
<p>The National Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 152 to all designated banks, stipulating the new foreign exchange settlement regulations after the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When exporters, etc., sell foreign exchange through designated banks, the National Bank may pay the entire amount in Gold Yuan at the statutory exchange rate of 4 Gold Yuan per US dollar, and will no longer issue foreign exchange settlement certificates.</p>
<p>(2) Importers, etc., who have obtained import licenses and are approved to purchase foreign exchange and have already obtained foreign exchange settlement certificates may purchase foreign exchange by submitting the foreign exchange settlement certificates and simultaneously paying 474,000 National Currency or 0.158 Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Importers, etc., who have obtained import licenses and are approved to purchase foreign exchange may purchase foreign exchange at a ratio of 4 Gold Yuan per US dollar without having to submit foreign exchange settlement certificates.</p>
<p>(4) Except for the above three items, designated banks must calculate all other foreign exchange transactions according to the new exchange rate for US dollars.</p>
<p>(5) All circulars previously issued by the National Bank that conflict with this circular shall be invalid.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Sets Foreign Exchange Balance Rates</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the new measures, the Central Bank has specially set the exchange rate for clearing daily foreign exchange balances and has notified all designated banks to comply with Circular No. 153 yesterday. The text is as follows:</p>

<h3>National Bank Decides to Open Remittances Nationwide</h3>

<h3>Foreign Exchange for Gold Yuan Reserve Partially Transferred to Issuing Bureau; Central Printing Factory Ceases Printing Operations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] According to Deputy Director Chen Yanzuo of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, the current amount of Gold Yuan is sufficient for the current needs of the entire country. It has been decided to stop the printing of banknotes at the Central Printing Factory from today, and the contract with the foreign banknote printing company will also be terminated. In the future, when the Issuing Bureau increases the issuance of Gold Yuan, the Business Bureau will first submit the reserve funds, which will be received by the Issuing Bureau before issuing banknotes. This procedure will ensure the stability of the currency value.</p>
<p>The gold, silver, and foreign currency currently held by the Central Bank have been partially transferred to the Issuing Bureau. The Ministry of Finance is also studying the method of transferring the remaining marketable securities used as issuance reserves.</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee will be established in Shanghai within days.

Wang Zhixin, the Acting General Manager of the Exchange, went to Beijing on the 20th and met with the Ministers of Finance and Industry and Commerce. The authorities stated that the government issued the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy this time to prevent drastic fluctuations in the market, so it ordered the stock exchange to temporarily suspend operations. Wang Zhixin personally stated the importance of the stock exchange in financial institutions and that it should be reopened as soon as possible. In the future, when the government issues Gold Yuan bonds, state-owned enterprises issue stocks, and private enterprises need construction, there will be many places where the stock exchange is needed. After the currency system reform, the currency value is stable, and the speculative component can be reduced, and the stock exchange business will naturally be more legitimate, and the future development can be expected. It is reported that Wang Zhixin will go to Beijing again within days to report on his work to the two ministers and ask the Executive Yuan for instructions on the resumption plan.</p>

Therefore, all laws and regulations of the Committee in the past will be reviewed again this time, so that they can be coordinated with the new measures, take into account the facts, and be implemented smoothly, and ensure that no problems will occur in the future. The heads of the Committee held a meeting yesterday morning to exchange views.

Starting from the seventh quarter, the import quota will be reduced by one-quarter.

After the revised articles are sorted out, they will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is estimated that it will take two weeks to resolve. During this transition period, the Committee's handling principle is (1) those that do not conflict with the Emergency Measures Decree will be handled as before.

<p>(4) The interest rate on interbank deposits (including deposit reserves) and national bank and bureau deposits is set at 2 cents per month.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the deposit and loan interest rates of commercial banks, it was decided that the Ministry of Finance would supervise and gradually handle them in accordance with the interest rate policy of the national banks and bureaus. The original interest rate control regulations will be implemented slowly, that is, the Central Bank will not temporarily approve the interest rates of commercial banks.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks Present Demands</h3>
<p>After the meeting of responsible persons of national banks and bureaus ended at 6:00 PM, Yu Hongjun immediately convened a meeting of responsible persons of commercial banks. Yu announced the results of the reduction in interest rates of national banks and bureaus, and then the discussion began.</p>
<p>Li Ming, Chairman of the Bankers Association, expressed his opinion, hoping that the interest rates of commercial banks could be gradually reduced to be close to those of national banks and bureaus, but hoped that the authorities would take into account the daily expenses of the banks when implementing this policy. At the same time, if the loan interest rate is too low, applicants for loans will make it impossible for the banks to cope.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, representatives of commercial banks put forward the following requirements: (1) In the future, deposit reserves can be paid with US dollar bonds. (2) The proportion of deposit reserves should be reduced, because the amount of chips has been greatly reduced after the currency system reform. (3) The National Bank should provide various assistance to commercial banks when necessary. (4) The balance of the National Bank's acceptance of the banks' obligations should be converted into Gold Yuan today (the 22nd) in order to meet the needs of customers on Monday.</p>
<p>Except for points (1) and (2), which need to be taken to Beijing by Vice Minister Xu Boyuan to request instructions from the Ministry of Finance, the remaining points were approved by President Yu. The meeting then ended at around 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Team; Defeated by Philippine Islands Team</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhong of Our Newspaper</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, London Airmail] Our country's World Games basketball team has fought fiercely so far, with two wins and three losses. Today (August 4th) at 7:00 PM, the match against the Philippine Islands team at the Haringey Arena was truly a crucial moment for our team. However, due to continuous battles over the past few days, the physical strength of the players was exhausted, and their performance became abnormal. As a result, they were defeated by the Philippine Islands team with a score of 37 to 51. The hard work of the previous two days was completely wasted, which is regrettable. Many Chinese spectators came to support the team, and Chinese naval students practicing in England also organized a cheering squad to cheer on the team, creating an unprecedented scene. The match results are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Yu Ruizhang) Huang Tianxi</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang (Jia Zhijun) (Li Zhenzhong)</p>
<p>Li Shiqiao Cai Wenhua Bao Songyuan</p>
<h3>Philippine Islands Tactics; Entirely American Style</h3>
<p>This match was also a life-or-death battle for the Philippine Islands team. Therefore, as soon as the game started, they attacked with all their might, quickly scoring a goal to take the lead with 2 to 0. Under strict surveillance, the two guards acted a little rudely, committing numerous fouls several times when our team was shooting, but for some reason, our players only made one goal out of four free throws today, which was the biggest cause of the failure. After that, the entire game was controlled by the Philippine Islands team, and our team was unable to resist. The tactics of the Philippine Islands team this time completely imitated the American style, using extremely short passes to transmit quickly. They never shot until they were 80 or 90 percent sure. Their center's skills were superb. Once the ball reached his hand, he would definitely score. In addition, the two guards were quite tall and marked people very tightly, so the performance was indeed very exciting. They quickly led with 10 to 4. Although our team also resisted with all their might, they were ultimately unable to take the lead. Bao Songyuan played very hard in this match, but unfortunately Cai Wenhua, for some reason, missed all three shots, and a good opportunity was lost. Although they once approached with a score of 10 to 8, they were quickly outscored by the Philippine Islands team with three quick goals in a ghostly manner, leading by a score of 16 to 8. In the subsequent battle, our team only scored a few points from free throws. At halftime, the score was 27 to 14, a difference of 13 points. During the break, spectators predicted that the Chinese team was doomed and would definitely lose today.</p>
<h3>The Situation is Gone; All Previous Efforts are Wasted</h3>
<p>In the second half, Coach Song adjusted the lineup, replacing Bao Songyuan with Li Zhenzhong. After the kickoff, Li Shiqiao immediately leaped up and threw the ball in with one hand, his posture being extremely perfect, earning a lot of applause from the audience. After that, although our team had many opportunities to get the ball, the forwards could not do anything under the close marking of the Philippine Islands team. On the contrary, that team used a calm and sure shot, further increasing the lead with a score of 31 to 17. At this time, Cai Wenhua was completely exhausted and was replaced by Jia Zhijun. In the meantime, Yu Ruizhang was replaced by Wu Chengzhang, and the situation became even more one-sided, with a score of 39 to 23. At this time, there were only ten minutes left in the game, and the coach immediately called in the original lineup from the beginning to make a desperate gamble. The Philippine Islands team also knew our strategy at this time and resisted with all their strength. The battle between the two sides was extremely exciting, but in the end, the difference in strength was too great, and the players' energy became increasingly exhausted. Under the gradual pressure of 41 to 25 and 47 to 27, our team was completely defeated. Although Wu Chengzhang scored several goals, it was in vain. In the end, the Philippine Islands team defeated the Chinese team with a score of 51 to 32.</p>
<p>In this game, it can be seen that long-range shots and long passes are no longer popular in the current new-style tactics. After gaining this experience in the World Games, the Chinese team can improve in the future. However, the lack of physical strength in our country is the biggest reason for repeated failures. It is commendable that our basketball team was able to win several times with their best efforts this time.</p>
<h3>Our World Games Football Team; Beats Siam Team Six to One</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 20th] Our World Games football team defeated the Siamese team today with a score of six to one. Our team's Li Zhaorong scored four goals alone with his foot and head skills. Zhu Yongqiang and Zhang Jinhai each scored one goal.</p>

<h3>The Death of Mr. Zhu Ziqing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>Since seeing the news about Mr. Zhu Ziqing's hospitalization for gastric ulcer treatment at Peking Union Medical College Hospital on August 8th, I had intended to visit him. However, I was also ill at the time, and I thought that I shouldn't disturb him when he was seriously ill. I knew that hospitals often refuse visits from people other than close relatives to those suffering from serious illnesses. Who knew that this thought was wrong; from then on, I would never have the opportunity to see Mr. Ziqing again!</p>
<p>There is no need for an introduction. Everyone who has read Mr. Ziqing's "Back View" in middle school Chinese textbooks knows how fluent, light, and profoundly meaningful Mr. Ziqing's articles are. From the publication of "Traces" in 1924 to today, he has dedicated himself to literary work for a full twenty-six years. If we start counting from when he began writing, it has been more than thirty years. He was a writer who earnestly researched academics and patiently encouraged young people. He served as a professor at Tsinghua University from August 1925 to this year, a full twenty-three years. Everyone who received his education knows his unique character: whether teaching or grading papers, he was very serious and not at all careless. He was never late or early for class, and he took attendance every class. Although he was so strict, no students disliked or resented him. The reason is that he had kindness and sincerity in his solemnity, which greatly moved young people.</p>
<p>Mr. Ziqing's alias was Peixian, and he used the pen names "Zhibai," "Baihui," and "Baishui." He was born on the ninth day of the tenth lunar month in the year of Wuxu in the Guangxu reign (1898) in Jiangdu, Jiangsu Province, and his ancestral home was Shaoxing, Zhejiang. In 1920, he graduated from the Department of Philosophy of the Faculty of Arts at National Peking University. In August of the same year, he served as a Chinese teacher at the First Normal School of Zhejiang Province in Hangzhou; from August to September 1920, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Eighth Middle School of Jiangsu Province in Yangzhou; from February to July 1921, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Sixth Normal School of Zhejiang Province in Taizhou; from September to October 1921, he served as a Chinese teacher in the middle school department of China Public School in Wusong; from July 1922 to January 1924, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Sixth Normal School and the Tenth Middle School of Zhejiang Province in Wenzhou; from February 1924 to July 1925, he served as a Chinese teacher at the Fourth Middle School of Zhejiang Province in Ningbo and concurrently as a Chinese teacher at Chunhui Middle School in Baima Lake, Shangyu; from August 1925 to the present, he has served as a professor in the Department of Chinese at Tsinghua University. (Editor's note: Mr. Peixian is the head of the Department of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University.)</p>
<p>As for his published works, there are the following fifteen kinds:</p>
<p>(1) Traces (poems and prose), published in December 1924.</p>
<p>(2) Back View (prose), published by Kaiming in October 1928.</p>
<p>(3) Miscellaneous Notes on a European Tour (travelogue), published in September 1934.</p>
<p>(4) You and Me (prose), published by Commercial Press in March 1936.</p>
<p>(5) Miscellaneous Notes on London (travelogue), published in April 1943.</p>
<p>(6) A Primer on Intensive Reading Guidance (essay), published in February 1941.</p>
<p>(7) A Study on the Distinction between Poetry Expressing Intention (essay), published by Kaiming in August 1947.</p>
<p>(8) Random Talks on New Poetry (criticism), published by the Writer's Bookstore in December 1947.</p>
<p>(9) Standard and Scale (criticism), published in April 1948.</p>
<p>(10) Gleanings on Language (book reviews and translations), published in April 1948.</p>
<p>(11) On Popular Appreciation of Elegance and Vulgarity (criticism), published in May 1948.</p>
<p>(12) The Influence of Language and Others (essay), published by Zhengzhong in 1948.</p>
<p>(13) Common Knowledge of Classics (essay), published in August 1942 (co-edited with Ye Shaojun).</p>
<p>(14) A Primer on Skimming Reading Guidance (essay), published by Commercial Press in January 1943 (co-edited with Ye Shaojun).</p>
<p>(15) Chinese Language Teaching (essay), published by Kaiming in April 1945 (co-edited with Ye Shaojun).</p>
<p>As for the essays and sketches scattered in newspapers and magazines across the country, they are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Mr. Ziqing first joined the Young China Association and the Literary Research Association, making great contributions to the New Literature. In the past six or seven years, he has devoted himself to the study of linguistics and guided young people on the path of literature because he saw that the Chinese proficiency of students in general middle and high schools has generally declined since the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, in addition to teaching at the Southwest Associated University, he also founded the Chinese Language Weekly with several teachers from the Teachers College of the Associated University in 1941, which was published by Kaiming Bookstore. After the restoration, it was published by Kaiming, and Mr. Ziqing remained the editor-in-chief. This year, in addition to editing high school Chinese textbooks for Kaiming, he also completed the Complete Works of Wen Yiduo. Unfortunately, the book was not yet published when Mr. Ziqing left this world forever.</p>
<h3>Demanding the Return of the Wensuge Library Collection from Japan</h3>
<p>— Zhou Tingwu</p>
<p>During the two Sino-Japanese incidents, the "September 18th Incident" and the "August 13th Incident", Japan not only plundered materials, but also looted many of our country's inherent cultural relics. Since the victory, our country's delegation to Japan has drawn up a list, presented it to the Allied Headquarters, and demanded the return of items from Japan. Now it has been reported in newspapers that the whereabouts have been learned, and those that have been recovered include copper coins, the copper bell of Hanshan Temple, and machinery from the Yongli Alkali Plant, etc. However, it has been discovered that during the September 18th Incident in 1931, Japan also looted the original handwritten copy of the Siku Quanshu stored in the Wensuge Pavilion of the Fengtian Imperial Palace, and it has not been mentioned to this day. I hope that our country's delegation to Japan will make a request to the Allied Headquarters to thoroughly investigate the whereabouts, so that Chinese cultural relics can remain flawless and be returned to Zhao in perfect condition.</p>
<h3>Thief's Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>The wind of theft has recently become more intense due to the increasing pressure of life. The newspaper recently reported that a batch of thieves was brought by plane from Hankou. Thieves traveling by plane can be said to be extremely wealthy, and their ability to steal pens, swapping them in front of the shop assistants who are packing them together, without them noticing in the slightest, is certainly very clever. Recalling what happened in Shanghai in the past, a certain gentleman had his gold watch stolen, and the circumstances were also very bizarre, as described below.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman lived in the Nanshi district and went to social gatherings in the north of the city every day, returning at night. One evening, the rickshaw puller asked for leave, so he took the tram home. At that time, there were no empty seats in the car, and he stood in the car, surrounded by several people on all sides, who deliberately pushed and shoved. The gentleman was experienced in going out and knew that his gold watch, with its chain slightly exposed, was likely coveted by them. So he focused his eyes on the watch, not looking elsewhere at all, watching how they would strike. After a while, the crowding became even worse, and he couldn't bear the disturbance, so he got off the tram. He saw a person get off with him. Then another tram arrived, and there were fewer passengers in the car, so the gentleman jumped on, and the follower also followed him on. The gentleman laughed inwardly, thinking that if this person was a thief, he was too stupid, knowing that there was a defense and still wasting his efforts. Before long, they reached the place where he had to change to another tram line. The gentleman got off again, and the person still followed him off, closely following him. The gentleman suddenly thought that there were definitely no such stupid thieves in Shanghai, but at that time the wind of assassination was very fierce. Could it be that he was mistaken for an assassination target? Hesitating to this point, he couldn't help but be greatly afraid and didn't dare to change to a rickshaw, because it was already late at night, there were few pedestrians on the road, and rickshaws felt quite isolated. Just as another tram arrived, he immediately rushed on, and the follower still followed him on. The gentleman became even more afraid, as if the god of death was already at his side. Fortunately, the tram had arrived near his home, and he immediately jumped off, and the follower also jumped off after him. The gentleman went straight into the alley, intending to reach his home in a few steps. Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the alley, the follower also chased into the alley and shouted from behind, saying that he had important matters to discuss and asked him to wait a moment. At this time, the gentleman was terrified, and although he wanted to run away, he didn't dare to move, fearing that if he ran, a bullet would be fired from behind! He had no choice but to wait anxiously. Unexpectedly, things turned out differently. The follower came forward and claimed to be a pickpocket, ordered by his master to steal the gentleman's watch. However, because he was prepared, there was no way to strike. However, the master's rules were extremely strict, and returning empty-handed would result in unbearable beatings. He could only voluntarily prepare the price to buy the watch so that he could return to life. His words were very sad and pathetic, and he presented banknotes, begging for mercy. The gentleman was quite moved, but worried that the banknotes might be counterfeit. Fortunately, the cigarette paper shop at the entrance of the alley was not yet closed, so he specially asked the shop assistant to identify the banknotes. They were all genuine. The gentleman then accepted the banknotes at the original price of the watch and gave him the watch. The pickpocket left with the watch. The gentleman returned to the alley, feeling no fear in his heart and even found the matter very interesting. Moreover, the company where the watch was purchased was currently offering a discount of 20%, so he could buy a new watch of the same style with the banknotes and still have 20% left over. While pondering this, he arrived at his doorstep, knocked on the door, and went in, immediately telling his family about his encounter, full of pride. However, when he recounted the part where he received the banknotes and handed over the watch, he reached into his pocket, wanting to show the original banknotes to his family, but they were nowhere to be found. He searched his body but found nothing. He exclaimed in surprise, and after a moment of reflection, he realized that when he received the banknotes and entered the alley, someone had rushed out of the alley and slightly brushed against him. At that time, he thought that the pickpocket had already obtained the watch and left, and he had no doubts. He didn't expect the thief to be so cunning, actually making his accomplice steal the banknotes when he was unprepared.</p>
<h3>Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>Each country has its own weights and measures, and each region also has its own weights and measures. Although there is already a so-called International Bureau of Weights and Measures, which uses platinum to make standard scales and places them there as standards, countries and regions inevitably continue to follow their old ways. This is like the concept of national boundaries, provincial boundaries, and county boundaries, and people are unwilling to change their previous habits.</p>
<p>Converting weights and measures is also quite brain-taxing. Often they are not much different in large numbers, but in decimals, even with seven or eight decimal places, it is still impossible to convert them accurately. As for in the market, generous people and thrifty people often have disputes over the difference of an inch or a tael. As a result, those who are willing to give up an inch or a tael give it up in vain, and those who are unwilling to give up an inch or a tael still do not give it up.</p>
<p>In order to gain an advantage, many people like to use their own weights and measures that they consider accurate, to avoid suffering losses due to the inaccuracy of the weights and measures used by others. As a result, both are inaccurate, and disputes are still inevitable.</p>
<p>If everyone treats each other with sincerity and puts courtesy first, why use any weights and measures? Conversely, even if they are used, the problem is not necessarily solved. The difficulty in implementing the theory of "accurate measures and fair scales, so that the people do not quarrel" lies in this.</p>
<h3>Garbage</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Garbage is a trivial matter and not worth wasting ink and paper on. However, according to our national sentiment, "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep" is already commendable. As for the dirt and garbage on public streets, everyone is already used to it.</p>
<p>Therefore, every day when I pass the entrance of Lane 930, Liyang Road, although I feel very uncomfortable, I cover my nose and pass by, thinking that if the Sanitation Bureau discovers it, it will definitely send someone to clean it up. I also think that in this large lane, there must be "good people" who love cleanliness and will write to the Sanitation Bureau to handle it.</p>
<p>But it is not so. For more than a month, not only has no "idle person" bothered to ask about it, but it has accumulated higher and higher, filling the pit. In addition to the garbage cans being completely submerged, it has also expanded its occupied territory by a zhang in length and width. On top of the garbage, there are fresh watermelon rinds and banana peels every day, benefiting the golden yellow houseflies a lot. I don't know if the gentlemen in the lane feel nauseous when they walk out of the lane and pass by the garbage mountain after eating their fill of watermelon?</p>
<p>Last year, a large photograph was published on the front page of the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, showing the garbage in a certain place, with the title: "The Shanghai Garbage Problem." Afterwards, the authorities paid attention to the removal of garbage, but "familiarity breeds contempt." Now, although it is summer, except for a few noble residential areas, it can be said that garbage is everywhere. The Sanitation Bureau recently announced that it has sprayed so many tons of DDT in the city since the beginning of this summer. Could it be that the garbage everywhere has been sprayed with DDT, so it is not cleaned up and it doesn't matter?</p>
<p>A foreign resident of Shanghai said it well: "If this were in Europe and America, the people would definitely question the government in droves: Where did our taxes go?"</p>
<h3>A Discourse on Sitting Meditation Experiences (5)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>There is also something to add: Sitting meditation must be a passive rest of consciousness. The two efforts of exercising the motor nerves and actively training the sympathetic nerves must be carried out simultaneously. This has an extremely important relationship in human anatomy and should not be neglected. As I said in the previous article, if the nerves in the head move, the legs suddenly tremble, and saliva is produced in the mouth, etc., these all occur when the brain is quiet and deep, subtle breathing is performed in parallel. I believe that doing only one will definitely not be like this, although I have not experimented with it yet. As for why there are these special anomalies after sitting meditation? (as mentioned in the previous article) How should it be explained? I have to ask physiology experts, but I don't dare to speak casually.</p>
<p>I have three hopes</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to put forward three hopes.</p>
<p>(1) I hope that this effective fitness method can be widely and universally publicized and promoted so that everyone understands it and is willing to learn it; especially for those who have busy jobs and use their brains a lot, I hope that they can set aside one hour or fifty minutes each day to engage in sitting meditation. In this way, not only can health be maintained, but also work efficiency can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>(2) I hope that the majority of people can clearly recognize that this sitting meditation method is a very ordinary fitness technique and does not contain any mysterious meaning at all. It can be learned and studied publicly. The mystical claims of the seeking-immortality-and-becoming-Buddha school can be ignored for the time being.</p>
<p>(3) Since this sitting meditation method can be explained by science, it may as well be further studied by scientific experimental methods. I hope that physiologists, psychologists, and physicians can unite to do a longer-term, planned experiment. Suppose that there are three people from each of the three parties, nine people in total, using the same method and the same time to sit, and each person records their experiences in detail. Each person takes out the data on time, jointly verifies it, and discusses it together. To be more precise, each person checks their pulse, blood pressure, lung capacity, heart function, and blood condition before and after each sitting, or at the beginning and end of each month, and makes a comparison. If this is done for a year or two, I believe that a correct conclusion will definitely be obtained. (Written on August 12, 1948, in Hubu Xuezhai, Shanghai. The full text is completed.)</p>
<h3>Welcoming Old Friend Bin from the South, Preparing Wine to Host and Accompany Him, and Recording Our Late-Night Conversation in a Poem</h3>
<p>— Qu Tuìyuan</p>
<p>The Yan dust on my lapel has not yet been collected,</p>
<p>Reuniting, I first lament our separation's sorrow.</p>
<p>Who can abandon the mountains and move the house?</p>
<p>The bamboo you planted yourself, is it still there?</p>
<p>The whole world knows your temples are frosted,</p>
<p>For ten years, I have seen bones forming mounds.</p>
<p>This land, you want to drift away from it again,</p>
<p>Allow me to share a fishing boat with you on the rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>With the meaning not exhausted, I use the same rhyme to write another poem</p>
<p>The forest wind and dew herald the gradual end of summer,</p>
<p>Our hearts are open and cheerful, briefly forgetting our worries.</p>
<p>The host has wine, let's drain a cup,</p>
<p>Meeting tonight, is it like a dream?</p>
<p>Old age loves Zhu Xiushui returning to the south,</p>
<p>Quietly studying the northern method of Li Yingqiu.</p>
<p>Discussing old learning, I can still catch up,</p>
<p>Today, there is an art boat with oars for us both.</p>
