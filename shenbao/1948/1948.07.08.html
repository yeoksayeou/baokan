<h3>社論　搶救失學　助學最樂</h3>
<p>暑假到了，過去本是學生最愉快的時候，但是現在却變了學生最苦悶的季節：大學畢業生瞅著「畢業即失業」，中學畢業生即感救葉之不易，又覺得大畢的門牆太高，也爲着無路可走而苦悶；至於一般尚在學程中途的大中學生，心頭上也無不橫著一個嚴重的問題，這就是下學期的學費問題，使他們愁到寢食不安。</p>
<p>在百物飛漲的今天，除了少數豪富巨商而外，全國大多數的家庭，在高物價的壓迫之下，無不感受到生活的威脅，對於子女的教育，根本就無力負祖；何况各校的學費，還要追隨物價之後，亦步亦趨，期期增加；下學期的收費，目前雖然尚未決定，但聞各校均將改收學米，大約大學六石，中學匹石。即以目前的米價每石二千萬元計算，下學期大中學費，即達億元左右；至九月間開學，米價還不知道要漲多少倍，試想這個學費問題，對於中等及其以下的家庭，是怎樣的一個嚴重的威脅呀！所以大多數的學生在暑假中，沒有一個不爲着下學期的學費而發愁，沒有一個不爲着行將失學而起恐慌。</p>
<p>照理說，護書是下一代青年應享受的權利，我國無法也有此規定；但是在萬方多難的今天，除了基本教育而外，還要政府完全負起教育下一代靑年的責任，勢有所不可能。因此失學靑年，不得不有待社會各界的救助。本報有鑒於斯，於今年一月間，早就發起「讀者助學運動」，爲廣大的失學靑年，向社會各界人士呼籲，慷概助學，結果共募得助學金七億元，搶救了五百多個大中學生，得以繼續安心求學。我們固不能以此爲滿足，但是初次嘗試，就能獲得這樣的成就，却給我們無限的溫暖，增加了我們無限的勇氣，使我們不得不繼續努力，再爲廣大的失學靑年羣向社會　命。</p>
<p>這次我們勸募助學金，暫以一百億爲目標，希望仍能搶救五百個大中學生，使他們不致因學費的昂貴而失學；對於廣大的失學靑年羣而言，固不免有杯水車薪無濟於事之感，但是在工商凋敝的今日，欲於短期內勸募一百億元，也不是一件輕而易舉的事情；而且我們發起「讀者助學運動」的眞正目的，不在本報募集助學金的多寡，而在造成社會上「助學最樂」的普遍風氣。社會各界人士只要願意拿出資金來，搶救失學靑年，不論其方式如何，不問其是否經由本報辦理，都是我們所竭誠歡迎的。</p>
<h3>改善僑匯的要點</h3>
<p>戰前僑匯總額，每年多至三億美元，而財次徐柏園近在立院報告，謂每年多至一億，少可五千萬美元；這與通常估計相差頗遠，但亦同樣承認其在國際　支上地位之重要。</p>
<p>自外匯市塲開放以來，外匯率和結匯辦法，已經過好幾次變更，而每次變更，無不以吸收僑匯與促進出口爲藉口，實際上，亦確在期望這兩項數字之增加。因爲進口限頻一再　减，迄今已至減無可减的地步，而外匯資金日形枯竭，美援多屬物資，又不能抵充是項用途，非從開源方面力謀擴充，則進口貿易，生產器材，與工業原料，均有難乎爲繼之勢。</p>
<p>不過吸收僑匯，其呼聲雖然極高，而實則每况愈下，有减無增。徐財次稱：卅五年爲三千二百餘萬美元，卅六年僅二千零十餘萬，現在每月不及五十萬美元，這是何等悽慘的一件事！但這並非由於僑匯之真正减少，而實由於逃避之大量增加。香港方面，華僑資金之岔集，與間粵兩省，民信局　手匯款之旺盛，這是共見共聞之事。所以年來僑匯數目之減少，只證明了當局吸收辦法之不　，而並不是僑匯來源之枯竭。換句話說：這批資金，大部份被迫流到他處去了。財政當局對於是項資金，雖抱著十分誠摯之希望，但其所採取之辦法確母寗說是揮之使去，並不是招之使來。何以見得？央行兪總裁在分晰僑匯减少的原因時，自己說明，是由於外匯牌價與黑市相差過遠。僑委會劉委員長亦言，由於官價與自由市塲價格相去過鉅，匯返祖國時，其幣値即行貶低，以致紛紛逃避，可知僑匯之所以逃避，實由僑民吃虧太大，而其所以吃虧之大，又由於所定官價太低，此外並無重大故障。但當局明知其故，却又始終不肯改訂合理的匯率，任令這項僑匯，以種種方式，逃向他處，這豈不是有意驅逐？</p>
<p>當局既要吸收僑匯，何以事實上又要加以騷逐？這是本間題微妙之點，也是一切經濟政策的徼妙之處。原來當局的一貫政策，是只顧目前，只貪近利，只打小算盤，而不肯統盤籌劃，計算到將來的後果，這不單是僑匯一事爲然·例如只知加重稅率，增加收入，就　不到礙及稅源；只知黃金存數六折還本，就顧不到礙及僓信，只知抑價收購，增厚利潤，就　不到　及再生產，只知高價樣售，充裕庫收，就顧不到刺激物價，只知效减指數，節省開支，就　不到公教人員的生活，只知抑低牌價，以收進僑匯及出口匯票，自然　不到走私與逃避了。</p>
<p>現在痛定思痛，旣然知道有鼓勵僑資回國之必要，而且已擬定辦法三項，即將付諸實施，我們希望懲前毖後，萬不可再存絲毫剝創的心理。所謂「民之　和，猶水之就下」，只須僑民實際所得，與黑市所得不相上下，我們不相信，他們定要設法透避；假如有計劃的壓低，方針不變，而只是掉換手法，自　　人，我們又相信無論如何變更，終不能達到預期的」</p>
<p>僑資內流，所以充實外匯，換取物資，其利益　在結匯時政府所得額外的利益之上，所以是項匯款，無論是按特價購入，或准予優惠待遇，其要點仍在於是否符合自由市價。現在是進口貨多，出口貨少，匯票之供給，顯然遠不敵需要。我們以爲任何進口貨物，只須已經依法申請，獲得許可，無悖於管理貿易的規定，則一切僑匯與自備外匯，儘可准其辦貨進口，以費挹注。須知外匯之爲物，其價値雖與國幣不同，而其主要作用仍不外用作交易之媒介，即其最終目的，不在於外幣之保藏，而仍在於國外物資之取得。所以物資進口，其意義無異於外匯流人。過去偏重資金，忽視物資，與遇絕物資，只要資金，不能不說是心理上的一種錯覺。値此改善僑匯之際，凡屬政策上，技術上和心理上的錯誤，我們盼望加以全盤的改正。</p>
<h3>嚴家淦談美援運用　着重於生產建設　收回一部通貨穩定經濟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美援運用委員會聯絡專員嚴家淦氏，六日自京來滬。記者昨特趨訪，據談：此次之美援，着重於國內之生產建設，俾能達到自力更生之目標。同時更望能籍美援之運用，對國內發生反通貨膨脹之效果，拋售美援物資，收回一部份通貨，穩定經濟，尤屬當務之急。渠稱，美援運用委會，係一綜合而强有力之機構，商定決策，並負推動之責。惟執行業務時，均利用原有機構，故運用委會責任雖重，惟機構並不龐大。</p>
<p>此次嚴氏陪同史蒂爾曼調查國，分赴各地調查，前後共歷十二日，途經漢口·大冶·武昌·長沙·株州·萍鄉·湘潭·衡陽·廣州，香港·屛東·台北等地，渠稱：此次美援中三大資助部門：一爲上海聯合電力公司，二爲粵漢鐵路，三爲粵漢鐵路兩旁之煤礦。美經濟合作總署爲瞭解實情，故有調查團之組設。目的在調查所定之美援計劃，是否切實可行，技術上是否有修正之處，此外對一般有關事業，亦同時予以注意。此行調查結果如何，尚在交換意見階段，史蒂爾曼之調查報告，可望於本月內向美經濟合作總署提出。此行時間雖甚侷促，惟我國已儘量提供所需資料，故就調查本身而言，應稱滿意。渠最後稱：調查目的，在研究如何使美援能對中國之建設，產生最大且最有效之結果。</p>

<p>〔中央社馬尼刺六日電〕我國駐菲公使陳質平，今與菲總統季里諾會晤，商談有關處置前居菲之華僑四千五百人問題，渠等係因戰爭而返中國，致不能享有移民律之權利而重返菲律賓。一九四一年返中國之華僑二千人，刻已獲准重返菲律賓，規定每月移入一百人，其中七十五人係　門人，其餘爲中國東部人民，陳公使以爲每月移入數過小，特向菲總統建議，每月移入二百五十人，傳菲總統告陳氏稱，渠將研究此一問題。陳氏並請菲總統重新考慮一九三七至一九四〇年返華之華僑令其返菲，按以前國際難民局會建議菲政府，處置該局所照料下無家可歸之曾旅菲而刻在中國之華僑，然未獲任何結果。</p>
<h3>戰時公私損失　暫難實施賠償　須俟日賠償總額確定後辦理</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕關於抗戰期間人民損失應如何賠償問題，市參議會曾於上月間根據市民建議，特電行政院，要求在業經拆遷裝回之日本賠償物資中，先行指定一部份，作爲賠償人民損失之用，此案經行政院賠償委員會研究後，昨已以京二字第六一一四號代電覆參議會，內稱：一查我國抗戰甚久，遭受破壞區域至廣，損失旣鉅，情形亦極複雜，政府對於抗戰期間各地公私損失，自應一體重視，無分軒輊，現以日本可供賠償之物資總額究値若干，各盟國如何支配，均未定案，若以目前拆遷運回有限物資實施賠償，事實上無法分配，勉强爲之，必難昭公允，基於上述原因及其他有關技術問題，故全國各地公私損失如何賠償，必須俟我國獲得日本賠償總額確定，另訂辦法公佈後，再行依照辦理。」</p>

<h3>奉駐歐總部緊急命令　美地中海艦隊調動　海軍部稱與聖地局勢無關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約七日廣播：美軍艦七艘今離伊斯坦埠及那不勒斯，前往地中海作「循例性」之活動。美海軍部稱，美艦隊此種行動，絕對與巴勒斯坦局勢無關。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕地中海港口如伊斯坦埠·那不勒斯·及法國弗朗許城之美艦，較預定啓椗時提早廿四小時於昨日駛離，今芷向地中海之茶地駛去。自法國弗朗許城啓椗者包括四萬五千噸之主力艦「霍蘇里」號在內。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕美駐地中海港口之有力戰艦，於巴勒斯坦休戰期屆滿前之七十二小時，突於今日奉召駛往未宣布之地點。原在伊斯坦埠之巡洋艦「法戈」號，「亨丁登」號及「裘諾」號，提早一天於今日啓椗離伊斯坦埠。消息靈通方面謂，此乃由於巴勒斯坦局勢之故。又巡洋艦「基薩傑」號，驅逐艦及供應艦各一艘，亦提早一天匆遽離那不勒斯，前往未宣布之地點。若干在羅馬觀光之艦員，竟不及隨艦而去。</p>
<p>〔聯合社伊斯坦埠七日電〕停泊此間及義大利那不勒斯港內之美艦，昨日接奉緊急命令突然離港，目的地不明。或謂開往巴勒斯坦，特里埃斯特及克里特島，衆說紛紜。據消息靈通人士稱，美海軍認爲美艦留於海面較爲得策，故有此項決定。有人則稱，此事由於巴勒斯坦停戰協定已遭嚴重破壞，或有撤退僑民之必要。但華府美海軍則宣稱，該批美艦調動，與巴勒斯坦事件絕對無關。航空母艦「巴勞」號停泊此間不久，即於昨晨開赴地中海東部，第六機動艦隊巡洋艦三艘旋亦啓椗。該三艘原定七日離港，艦隊司令休曼昨接倫敦美國大西洋艦隊司令急電數通，臨時改變計劃，據消息靈通人士稱，係開往克里時島附近海面，以待局勢發展。其他美艦四艘則自那不勒斯向南行駛，海軍憲兵深夜入城尋覓美兵，聞有至少十人落後，未及登艦。</p>
<h3>聖地戰火再爆發　貝那多特參謀長遭槍擊　法休戰監察員中槍不治身死</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕七日乃貝那多特限令猶阿雙方對其延長休戰建議提出答覆之最後限期，貝那多特將以猶阿雙方之答覆向安全理事會提出交其討論。外傳發生破壞休戰令行動之報告，已經台拉維夫證實。</p>
<p>貝那多特之參謀長彭特上校，昨在海發南十二哩處阿拉伯附近接洽當地休戰時遭人開槍射擊，殆係發自阿拉伯軍陣地方面。猶方並謂，伊拉克軍及阿拉伯遊擊隊曾向猶方公路上之車輛射擊，猶軍裝甲車立即馳往增援。又據成功湖電：聯合國當局宣布，海發方面之報告謂聯合國休戰監察員法國拉勃里埃少校，於在海發東南二十哩處調查破壞休戰事時中槍受傷，於昨日不治身死。</p>
<p>〔聯合社開羅七日電〕猶太與阿拉伯軍今日在台拉維夫通海發之主要公路沿綫發生激戰，同時聯合國調解員貝那多特正作延長停戰期限之最後努力。據貝氏在此宣稱，延長停戰建議若遭拒絕，仍當繼續磋商。公路激戰係自昨夜開始，在蒂拉與耶巴間以色列領土上，北距海發約十哩。合拉維夫與海發間電話綫已被切斷。美海軍陸戰隊二人駕駛聯合國監察團卡車，中途爲阿拉伯軍所阻，阿軍向之開火歷四十分鐘，旋經美軍揮動白旗，始告停頓。美國攝影記者麥克魯自合拉維夫循間道駕車赴海發，在海法南約二十哩處亦遭阿軍開槍射擊。</p>
<h3>延長聖地休戰期　安理會未獲協議</h3>
<p>阿猶對此將正式　答覆</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖六日電〕貝那多特電請延長聖地停戰期之際，整個巴勒斯坦問題，今在安理會中又有爆發危機，該問題雖非安理會本日之議程，但貝氏之來電，在會中引起初步舌戰，各理事國所持意見頗不一致，英美堅請安理會迅採措施，以延長爲時僅餘三日之巴勒斯坦停戰期限，認爲此一行動，應立即採取而不需辯論阿猶談判之實質問題及貝那多特之和平建議。另一方面蘇聯及烏克闌則認爲延期之決定不能「單獨獲致」，故主張對整個巴勒斯坦問題舉行充分辯論。蘇島兩方雖不反對延長停戰期限，但其　欲將貝那多特之和平建議公開於安理會之前。按貝氏建議主張耶路撒冷城應由阿拉伯人而非國際政權治理，阿猶兩國疆界應予大事修改。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕猶阿旣已拒絕貝那多特之巴勒斯坦和平建議，而貝氏要求延長休戰之建議，亦以七日爲提出答覆之限期。如雙方再予拒絕，勢須召集安全理事會之會議以考慮適當的行動。貝氏於六日下午自台拉維夫飛開羅接受阿拉伯對延長休戰事之答　，渠定七日再赴台拉維夫接受猶　之答、一般預測以色列政府或將接受休戰之延長。然阿拉伯之態度，則尚有疑問。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕英外交部發言人稱：英人五名，被猶太伊爾根團人員自耶城縣有聯合國休戰委員團旗房屋內綁架而去，英政府對此事極度重視，要求立即將此五人釋放，發言人並未透露該五人之姓名。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕此間消息靈通方面相信，英美法今日致蘇之照會，並非最後通牒性質，亦未建議如果蘇聯拒絕解除封鎖，西方國家將採何種步驟。消息靈通方而並信，除非蘇聯得有肯定的表示，以示具有打破僵局的準備，西方國家並不擬舉行四强會議，重新討論德國問題。西方國家之決定不由四强在德軍事長官從事談判，而由四國政府直接交涉，已使柏林爭端進入新而更廣的階級。又據華盛頓電稱，美國外交觀察家，對三强蘇照會之遲至若干日後公布，俾予蘇聯以提出答覆之合理時間，甚爲重視。料三强照會之內，殆已建議蘇方所宜採取之若干肯定行動，蘇方如置之不理，西方强國即將採取斷然的行動。</p>

<h3>百余交通工人被裁　公共汽車一度停駛　請愿無結果今繼續談判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市公用局公共交通公司，二十一屆司機七十二人，十八屆售票一百二十五人，昨日突被公司當局宣佈留職停薪。被裁司機售票除赴社會局公用局請願，請求救濟外，並於下午三時半，由被栽之司機售票分隊至中正西路，華山路口，靜安寺及外灘中正公園等處，攔阻三路，九路，十路，四路，十一路，六路，十五路等各線車輛行駛，並擴大宣傳以求其他員工同情。公司當局聞訊，交通組組長王總善副組長丁慰堂，即趕赴各主要停車站勸導。四路，十一路，六路，十五路等各綫旋即相繼恢復行駛，九路，十路，三路等綫於下午六時許亦先後恢復。</p>
<p>交通公司於四月一日在上海，杭州兩處招考司機售票，四月二十四日將錄取工人受短期訓練，五月五日即派赴全運會交通車服務，底薪四十三元，按工人生活指數發給。此批司機售票，原來均有工作，因公司當局一再保證，服務以後，如無重大過失，或不治之症，決不停職，故各人均將原來工作辭去，入該公司安心服務。詎料昨日下午三時許，該公司交通組長王總善，忽宣佈趙兼主任委員之命令，以營業淸淡，及汽油來源困難爲由，將司機自一〇一〇號至一〇八五號，售票自一〇五〇號，至一一七九號，留職停薪，每人發給工資半個月，約一千五百萬元，返杭州者，送三等車票一張。此項命令自八日起實行，被裁司機售票，聞此消息，宛如晴天霹靂，當即大　，謂如過去旣不需要增加工人，則不應招考，旣考取則工作應有保障，不能隨便停職，在此失業人數衆多之時，倉卒間宣佈停職。毫無轉業凖備，則生活立陷於恐慌，請求當局收回成命。王組長即瀝述公司困難，並云此係上峯決定，無法挽回，以後公司如營業恢復，當儘先任用。工人等見無結果，即集合百餘人，（夜班及分散各處者不在內），分乘四部大）汽車向社會局請願。</p>
<p>代表請愿　陳述痛苦</p>
<p>請願工人於四時許抵社會局，推代表四人，請謁吳局長，當由樊振邦科長接見。據代表陳述，公司此項突如其來措施，陷工人生活於絕境，此一千五百萬元之遣散費，只可買到七斗米，而尋覓新工作至爲不易，並痛陳公司當局對工人之分化政策，三千餘工人之公司，迄今尚無工會。樊科長表示，對工人之遭遇，極表同情，惟該公司係屬公用局，各位如有痛苦，應先向公用局陳訴，本人當將各位請願意旨，報告吳局長，由吳局長與趙局長再商妥善方策。</p>
<p>五時許請願之司機售票在社會局廣塲決定兩項辦法：（一）集合其餘未到塲之被裁工人七八十人，全體組織一臨時委員會，向有關各方呼籲。（二）即向公用局趙局長請願。五時一刻請頤工人仍乘四輛大汽車駛向公用局。</p>
<p>要求解散費一年</p>
<p>到公用局時，趙局長適與各電力公司代表舉行電力分配檢討會議，一百九十餘人集結樓梯走廊不願離去，並用粉筆到處塗寫「我們要吃飯」，「反對無條件裁員」等標語。至六時半，組長王總善，副組長丁　堂先後趕到，向工人訓話，勸回廠商談。全體請願工人乃於七時五分離公用局隨王組長回廠，推派代表與公司當局進行談判。工人要求如不能准其繼續工作，則每人給解散費一年。此項糾紛，至深晚尚未解決，今日將繼續談判。</p>
<p>公司發表裁減苦衷</p>
<p>據公司表示，其他工人情緒良好，毫不受影響，今日各綫車輛可照常行駛。據稱：該批外勤工人，係四月四日分別在本市及杭州招考入公司者，售票員自一〇五〇至一一七九號（中有五人中途自動退職）一百廿五人，司機一〇一〇至一〇八五號七十二人，共計一百九十七人，爲公司所有員工中最新者，此次市參議會公用事業調查委員會提出之調查報告中，以公共交通公司員工過多，公司當局亦以營業情形不佳，收支不能平衡，故有此次裁减外勤員工之舉。公司實亦有不得已之苦衷。該批工人均經公司訓練，俱屬優秀份子，他日公司營業好轉，仍需招回復用。此次暫時遺　，爲留職停薪，與解　不同。</p>

<h3>人權保障委員　參觀上海監獄　忠字監房兩犯一室姿態各個不同</h3>
<p>獄中工塲設備齊全工作囚犯形容整潔　設圖書館敎誨室識字班施以感化敎育</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會人權保障委員會委員瞿鉞·趙君豪·陳保泰·周斐成·張中原·侯寄遠·總務組主任卜昇華，編審李本寬，及中外記者數人，昨日下午參觀提籃橋上海監獄，出典獄長孔祥霖陪同巡視忠字監房及膳廳工塲等一週。監獄內部頗予人以整潔之印象，忠字監房內所囚者均係漢奸貪汚案犯，每兩人囚於一室，有茫然呆坐者，有低頭讀書者，有以木板作案振筆練字者，有面壁而立不願以面目示人者。囚室中木板地舖，離地約有半尺，被褥·便桶·木箱·書籍·食品等物紛然雜陳，然亦有佈置甚爲情潔者</p>
<p>外籍囚犯待遇較佳</p>
<p>囚犯每日進餐兩次，規定食米十八兩，每日上下午囚室門各開放一次，可在走廊中散步或運動一小時。監獄當局對於囚徒以感化爲宗旨，挑選其中品行良好邀守獄規者担任烹任洗滌及其他工作。廚房中堆有冬瓜洋葱將待下鍋，洗衣房中圓簡形之機器正在轉動，木器工塲·縫纫工塲·印刷工塲·排字工塲·裝訂工塲·皮鞋織襪工塲·裝箱工塲等，均有不少囚犯正在工作。製成品有箱桌·淘　·旗袍·衣袴·文件·表格·鞋襪·木箱等，均係外界定製。工塲設備甚爲齊全，如縫紉工塲有縫衣機二十餘架，印刷工塲大型印機甚多，排字工塲有漢文正楷鉛字七千餘字。工作之囚犯均形容整潔，望之儼如普通工人。教育方面獄中設有圖書館，教誨堂，及識字班，由教化科負責輪流集中囚犯施以感化教育。外監中有外籍囚徒三十餘人，渠等所居囚室較大，所臥牀舖爲帆布牀，所食爲麵包，待遇較國人爲佳，然猶對伙食表示不滿。女　昨因時間不及，未往參觀。</p>
<p>籲請協助添置門洞</p>
<p>孔典獄長於引導參觀完畢後，向各參議員談及一事，爲獄中接見家屬之門洞現時僅有五處，同一時間內僅有五人可接兌家屬，而獄囚共有五千餘人，每人每月規定可接見家屬兩次，平均每日有三百犯人須應用此五處窗洞，因人數太多，各人會談時間祗好縮短，獄囚與家屬均極感痛苦。獄方本計劃添建爲十二處，因經費未蒙上峯核准，不能實現，希望社會上熱心人士，能予協助解決。</p>

<h3>水上交通已恢復　航利輸脫險歸來　乘客曾登崇明島避風飽受驚嚇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕颱風離境後，昨日天氣放晴，水上交通恢復。江亞輪於昨午四時半駛甬，江靜輪已由寗波駛滬，今晟照常可到。太古公司漢陽輸，今日亦可抵埠。美邦公司海爾斯號，由墨西哥運來柴油一萬五千噸，前日大風雨中，駛至銅沙，因引水員未及上船，由船主自任領港，行駛不及哩許即遭擱淺，幸於漲水時出險，昨晨引水員登輪後，業已安然來滬，現泊石油公司碼頭起卸。益祥公司福裕輪，前日被颶風吹至浦西岸邊擱淺，昨晨已拖曳出險，仍泊十一·十二號浮筒裝貨駛粵，中國航運公司瑞新輪，泊三十五·三十六號浮筒，前日亦因風擱淺，昨午業經拖出，仍泊原浮筒。其餘美輪多艘，前日有因風斷繼擱淺者，昨均恢復常態衆航公司航利輪，前晨自任港返滬，載客三百餘人，至寶山角獅子林江面，遇颱風被阻前進，形勢危急，中午急電求救，該公司接電後，急往各處設法，派船援救，奈因大風雨中，無法可施，幸該輪船主機警，即向對江崇明島緩緩駛去，至堡鎭暫避，一面將乘客引登岸上。昨據該公司消息：乘客船員均安然無恙，今晨仍由原船返滬。大通·大達聯營處江康輪，前日在　港避風未開，改昨晚起椗，今晨到滬，當晚駛南通。</p>
<p>江面駁船　失事七起</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕颱風過滬施虐，海陸損失慘重，詳情已誌昨報。茲悉：浦江中被災各戶，昨日先後具報水上警局者，共有七起：（一）陳任福委託周福記運輸行八八六八九號駁船，　運綫慶四百五十包，至招商局第七碼頭擬搬上登　輪，不料中途遇風傾覆，貨物漂失。（二）民益產物保險公司代裝大成紡織公司元布二百五十件，蝶球細布二百五十件，合計一萬疋，駁船遏風沉沒，損失三千億。（三）南榮記報關行裝運各種棉紗六十件，布疋七十九件，裝載嚴船至福裕輪卸貨，不幸亦告失事。（四）南榮記一二三四五號一二〇二四號兩駁船，裝載麩皮五百包，在招商局第七碼頭沉沒。（五）中國旅遝公司代運安達紡織廠棉紗百餘件，分裝駁船二二四六五號及一二〇九九號兩艘。同告漂失。（六）大信隆報關行三一八七九號駁船，裝載棉紗七十件，龍頭細布七箱，亦告失事。（七）太古昌公記報關行，由駁船裝載漂白布八件，計二百包，在浦東華棧碼頭失事。</p>

<p>水上警局張分局長會飭大批員警紛紛乘艇，在浦江中打撈貨物，茲悉已被撈起者，計有各種棉紗十一件，零星棉紗廿三捆，白布六件零五疋，肥皂七箱，書籍二十件，麵粉四十九袋。又經怡和紗廠員工撈起棉紗八件，肥皂一箱，教科書二箱，已通知水上警局核辦。</p>
<h3>西片談判　行將重開　影院不滿廉價政策　難望與國片商合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市影院業，西片商，國片商間，因停供新片問題所引起之三重糾紛，自日前在社會局洽商毫無結果後，乃愈陷入僵局。社會召集三方面商談之目的，原爲居間调解，俾使影片供應關係早日恢覆正常，但因席間相互責難，彼此不能融洽，遂致不歡而散。國片商代表羅學濂認爲電影事業係教育民衆之有力工具，故强調票價應力求普及。影院方面則以爲目前二三四輪影院之低廉票價，事實上已在推行普及工作，但首輪戯院因受實際支出影響，各級票價自不能不略予提高，最後曾提出兩點理由，要求將限價座調整爲廿五萬元：（一）首輪影院限價過低，已與二三四輪影院售價相差無幾，足以威脅渠等生存，恐又因此横生枝節。（二）限　與自訂票價距離過大，且座位有限，黑市必因之猖獗，觀衆不免仍受影響。惟結果此項要求爲社局所否決。據影院業公會方面表示：渠等當初與西片商毅然解約，原希與國片商合作，但國片商祗圖爭佔較優影院，以鞏固自身地盤，而置各影院生存條件於不顧。渠等對羅學濂以個人意見主張廉價政策理論，忽視影院利益，尤表不滿，故各首輪影院目前已在會商放棄以往決定，正式向西片商重開談判，談判之唯一前提自爲提高售價，除三成限價座仍爲廿萬元暫時無法調整外，渠等擬將其餘當局准許自由加價之各級票價，調整爲最低五十萬元，最高一百萬元以內。此種辦法果於日內實行，西片商供給新片問題自可順利解決。惟排隊購買限價影票之行列勢將益形擁擠，而操縱限價票之「黃牛」，亦將更見活躍矣。</p>

<h3>開封血影</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　凌松壽</p>
<p>〔本報開封一日航訊〕六月十六日，匪陳毅部第三，八，十三個縱隊，配合伯承部第一縱鰍，於攻陷陳留後，在開封南方大隄外，發出了第一槍，這黄河畔的古城，開始降臨了一陣暴風雨。</p>
<p>戰事開始就在大堤東南兩方進行，進攻的匪軍，十六日，還只是少數的先頭部隊，十七日，匪在陳留通許一帶的主力，逐次北移，汴城東西兩個車站——興隆，杏花營失守，六萬多的匪徒，一步步地向着開封緊逼，劉茂恩主席和整六十六師李仲辛師長，爲了集中兵力，遂自動地放棄大隄和飛機塲，在城東南兩面的郵政管理局，中國公學，禹王台等重要據點，佈置下堅强的防綫。這時</p>
<p>開封守軍</p>
<p>，計有六十六師第十三旅的三個團和師旅直屬部隊，另外有保安第一二旅和保五，六兩個團。十七日午後，自攷城西下的援軍整六十八師一一九旅兩個團，沿途經過匪的重重襲擊，只有一個團抵達開封，做東關守軍的預備隊，旅部和另外的一個團，還被共匪戰斷在城外，無法人城，在這樣少的守軍駐守下，開封的防禦佈署是這樣的：十三旅的卅七卅九兩個團分守北，東兩面城垣，保五團駐防西關，保一旅（只有一個團）駐宋門，保二旅和保六團在大南門的大據點郵政管理局，小南門外的中國公學和禹王台兩個據點由十三旅的第三十八團守衛。十八日淸晨一時，汴垣的攻防戰正式開始，匪以三路分犯東西兩門及大南門，我守軍憤怒的火花，隨着步機槍和手溜彈而發洩出來，在風沙中的古城畔，在淡淡的月色下，來犯的匪軍，一個個倒下去了，東（即曹門）西南三門的戰果，傷亡的匪軍都在一營以上。當然，匪不能就此罷休的，入夜以後，又以主力向宋門我保一旅陣地猛樸，另以一部在汴垣西北角騷擾，以牽制我曹門的守軍第三十九團。砲聲，機槍聲響了一夜，十九日長一時後，匪約一營，突入宋門，但旋即爲我守軍消滅。三時左右，五百多個匪，在熾烈的砲火掩護下，復躍近距東南城角約五百公尺處，企岡突入，又被我强烈的火網殲滅了。</p>
<p>黑天到白天，天明到天黑，槍砲聲在無止盡地響着，我空軍也不分晝夜地在</p>
<p>汴城上空</p>
<p>盤旋，時時刻刻地在協同地面部隊作戰，和摧毁敵後陣地。然而這種種措施，遏阻不了共匪要吃人的心。十九日午後二時五十分，匪終於突破小南門，並向着市中心地區進展，可是在每條街道旁，在每幢房屋上，國軍早就準備好了堅强的巷戰工事，爲了保衛大開封，我少數的英勇守軍，加强壓力，迫使匪向東南角上後退，戰事演進到這個局面，上帝已經注定了開封和開封人的命運，由於匪軍集中火力，向我城南陣地射擊，郵政管理局的大厦，已經起火，保二旅和保六團的傷亡均重，於是退守城內，繼續地在每個碉堡中，與入城之匪進行着慘烈的巷戰。</p>
<p>被壓迫到城東南角的殘匪，藉着砲火的掩護，不久又向市心區猛擾。午夜，西門亦被匪突入，於是省政府的防禦戰展開。</p>
<p>劉茂恩主席指揮着汴垣的防衛戰，這時已經四晝夜未眠了，（雖然他平時每日睡眠也只有四小時。）當共匪的子彈，開始尚省府發射的時候，侍從人員早就勸他突圍，可是他不願意，他說：爲了開封，他應當支持到最後的一瞬。</p>
<p>和過去的幾天一樣，槍砲聲日以繼夜地響着，不過是更激烈一些罷了。到了二十日拂曉，</p>
<p>省府據點</p>
<p>，屹然未動，不同的是在它的周圍增加了無數被利用而犧牲的屍體。</p>
<p>廿日午後共匪開始以硫璜彈向省府射學，共匪的兇燄，蔓延到省府的每幢房子上面，省府成爲一片火海！同時匪復以突擊部隊，繞到省府北面，自劉主席的辦公室偸襲，在這一條狹小的弄堂中，來往衝殺，數小時內竟達廿餘次，在這裏，機槍，步槍，已失去了它的效能，能用的武器，只有手溜彈，爲了爭奪這個據點，匪又犧牲了兩個營的主力，廿日入晚後，劉茂恩主席和幾個侍衛，以及整五軍幹訓班的謝大隊長，某連長等，入了地下室，他看到情形已不能挽救，幾次想自殺成仁，可是他身邊沒佩帶武器。同時又被身旁的人監視着。局面一步步地緊張，劉主席身邊的人，一再苦勸他突圍，劉主席始終不答應，當他的三兄劉鎭筆先生向他進言時，他一反平常尊敬的態度，一脚把鎭筆先生踢開，並且怒叫，你們懂得什麼？廿一日最二時，省府這個據點實在撑不下去了，於是魏隊長和其他幾位，顧不了他願意不願意，架起他來就跑，經過了小巷，爬過了死屍，從西南城角出城。當然，兩年來劉氏在河南苦撑一個不易支持的局面，爲了河南的將來，爲了三千萬的河南人，他是不能死的。</p>
<p>廿一日淸晨，鋼骨水泥的省府，已成灰燼，殘留的守軍，在守無可守的情况下，被解決了！這時，共匪復</p>
<p>突破北關</p>
<p>向着李仲辛師長指揮所所在地龍亭猛擊，我守衛河南大學的部隊，向着北城垣某據點（在龍亭北偏西）集中固守。</p>
<p>龍亭高十數丈，它的左前方和右前方濒水，後面是一片開闊地帶，在地形上是一個很好的據點。在白天，我空軍不斷地以機槍封鎖龍亭正面通到市區的一條小路，同時龍亭背後我軍也以機槍聯合城西北角一碉堡交織成一片火網，使匪無法接近。不過，這不渦是盡人事以待天命罷了，匪進犯開封，到了祗剩下一個據點的時候，難道還能功虧一簣地放鬆它嗎？到了晚間，匪以密集的砲火，向着龍亭射襲，幷不斷以人海戰術，向前衝殺，在十一時左右，龍亭上剩下的守軍，非傷即死，彈藥告盡，已不勞共匪的猛攻而陷落。同時，在城北碉堡中的李仲辛師長自殺成仁，少數的守軍，苦戰到廿二日晨九時許終被解決。惡戰七日的開封，至此遂淪入匪手。</p>

<p>〔本報長沙一日航訊〕長沙出土的木器之中，最有研究價値的，爲凸目吐舌的偶像，這種偶像出自大木槨墓中的木櫝中，木檀大小如棺，偶像均有木座，偶像之前陳列琴一，羽觴數只，陶器數只，木俑數只。此像頭上有角，其角用鹿角，或鹿角，有完整或出土時已毀，這種偶像共出十餘件，（每墓祗一座）。最完整者，均流入美國，美人稱他爲山貓，中國人稱他爲方相，但方相是戴鬼面驅鬼的役人，此偶像則爲墓中供奉之物，形狀相同，不能混爲一談，應從他的用途去研究，台灣土人有戴角的偶像，巴里岛有吐舌的巫人，以此二地的風俗加以研究，可以知道古代的南方是與太平洋各島的風俗相同的若是根據他供奉的一點來看，可稱是一種圖騰，或中國古書上的社主，現代鄉下人的木主牌位其他則有藏劍之盒，令節之盒，負鐘鼓之大虎，木戈木劍等等。</p>
<p>木俑</p>
<p>有長三尺七八寸者，男女均備，其中有手足可動者肌肉畢露者在南方潮濕的泥土中，能有晚周時代的彫刻發現，眞可說是一件奇蹟。我研究彫塑二十餘年，曾寫過一部彫塑志，本人認爲中國古代彫刻，最早也不過漢代，所以在畏沙看到楚人木彫時，我幾乎驚得目瞪口呆了。中國博物館中，禹鼎湯獲是常見的，而彫刻品中，有六朝的精品，也是難得之極，至於晚周時代的木彫，實屬聞所未聞。</p>
<p>漆器</p>
<p>有藏銅鏡及櫛的匳，匳爲圓桶形，有蓋，或分三疊，下層藏小盒三只。有用銀或銅鐸在漆匳的口沿上，（漢代稱爲扣器），下綴銅脚，中綴苜面含環。（博物館中有一破銅底即此）全身加厚漆，又在漆上畫人物，圖案，禽獸，或者是用針劃刻成紋，細如游絲，變化無窮。底部偶有篆文，曰「廿五年」等等。</p>
<p>漆的用途，在當時似甚普遍，上面所舉的偶像，有一件，不但用漆，而且還滿身繪花，劍鞘雖是木製，可是黑漆生光，其厚如布，那藏令節的盒中，有漆皮三捲，則比皮還厚。又有那些大陶器。</p>
<p>鼎壺</p>
<p>外表也是石子漆生光，上輪五彩光草。棺的上面，也是厚漆，其花紋之複雜，差不多可媲美燉煌　　，但這種花棺，連美國也沒有，中國藏家更不用談了。爲了這花棺之蓋的失去，想起還要痛心。</p>
<p>上舉之漆王外，要算</p>
<p>漆盤</p>
<p>漆羽觴最多了，漆盤至少出土六十件，羽　則有三百只，但完整而可保存的，大約爲十分之一吧了。因爲漆玉在出土時，均完好如新，在封存的保護箱中，半年之後，就裂破不堪了。要是這是有計劃的發掘，出土即攝影，慕繪，則楚族紋飾之美，實足驚駭全世界。其他，漆几及戎衣的漆化亦很美，可惜太少了。</p>

<h3>澈查倉庫聲中囤戶心虛　米價已開始回降</h3>
<p>米市昨因銀根緊俏，客戶均欲脫售，更以澈查倉庫，囤戶恐慌，粉紛乘先脫手，供應頓見充沛。初開尚見平穩，後市步降。上白粳及高薄稱羊秈各退至二千一百萬，較上日降落百萬元，市塲報價仍爲二千萬，惟品質則見提高矣。昨日到貨南北二市共登記五八一八石。</p>
<p>麵粉因價格未決定，須待廠商下午開會後決定，市塲交易仍停頓未開。老軍及兵船粉塲外價格爲六百六十五萬元，因小麥及錫價高昂，故市勢甚堅。麩皮四百五十萬，小包三百五十萬，小麥廠盤達九百萬。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>普遍挺升，因上日恢復交易後，價格大都未加足，是以貨主均堅持喊高。黄豆價格與豆餅及油價合之，價格過低，故昨日挺升一百萬元。漢口乍豆由五六家漢帮共同以一千萬之價開出近六千包，大都爲油廠去化。苞米挺二三十萬，蠶豆漲十萬，菉豆芝蔴生仁均前漲不足，昨日加價較多。菉豆升一百至二百萬，芝蔴挺二三百萬，生仁升四五百萬元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>價格均較限價爲低，因銀根趨緊，回籠吐出亦多。大有豆油初開爲四千四百四十五萬，後以四千三百八十萬收市。長德豆油爲四千二百萬元，生菜油低百萬，以四千二百萬成交。生油價定，凈生油原盤成交。小車蔴油挫百五十萬，豆餅早平午軟，退落十萬。</p>
<h3>市塲禁制鬆動　華股前途恍惚</h3>
<p>華股昨以業外各市塲之禁制略形鬆動，游資興趣開始分散，都有仰高而止之現象。勤興景綸之漲停，復有火柴新華之跌停，參差之過程，前途恍惚。連漲之後，恐將盛極而衰。</p>
<p>晨初人心因連漲之後，咸具戒心。開出疲者居多，永紗以六八五〇元登塲，八九號一五四號一七六號五四號六五號二二五號八九號一〇四號二一八號九八號均買，漲到七一九〇號新高價。勤興景綸宣告漲停，逢高經廣帮二〇二號一五五號，大戶一五二號二〇三號一四五號九五號二三〇號一二二號，銀行帮二二〇號力加脫手，最後一次代辦費仍開原價，回小到六八二〇元。紗和布之禁制，已告寬放，不免略有分散也。一七六號九五號八九號八五號一一六號維持，曾回好到七一〇〇元，終以存多湧出，二〇三號一八四號一六九號一六四號二一九號一八〇號八九號再來了結，火柴反告跌停板，午收退爲六八五〇元。較前收計景綸勤興內衣恒豐漲半成至一成，國貨商務閘北景福大通榮豐火柴中絲跌半成至一成，餘者升降俱有。</p>
<p>後市永紗先高至七一五〇元，高後先退至七〇二〇元，二〇六號一八上哪號一七九號一八〇號一〇六號三號八號一七六號五四號再進至七二六〇元新紀錄。景綸勤興漲到限度，廣帮二〇二號及大戶一一七號九五號六一號一三一號等了結，逐漸下游，低至六九五〇元。火柴及新華反動跌停板，國行差進不多，轉入盤檔，收市七千元。較最收計景綸大通漲停，新華火柴跌停，商務勤興國貨尚平，永公閘北升半成，華新低半成，餘均榮辱俱微。塲外各未上市股票以大生世界升起一成爲俏利，餘均平平。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨漲風加劇，統丙晨開九八萬，高峯達一〇四萬，而後稍平。三六〇室五〇一二室賣出。五五二室五〇〇室則進，成交不過三百萬，較前收計甲乙戊各升十萬元，丙漲十五萬元，丁昂十一萬元。</p>
<h3>轉帳申請書　禁撥付客戶</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金管局對轉帳申請書之使用辦法，久已令飭本市谷商業行莊遵行，即使用時僅限於同業往來，不得撥付客戶。惟近經該局派人調查，發現行莊未能完全遵行，今後該局沙加强檢查，務期禁絕撥付客戶。</p>
<h3>內滙率調整</h3>
<p>四行兩局一庫內匯率，八日起修正如次：厦門三〇〇元，泉州二八〇元，汕頭三〇〇元，連雲港四〇元，新浦四〇元，南通二〇元，徐州四〇元，屯溪一〇〇元，蕪湖七〇元，蚌埠八〇元，歙縣一〇〇元，靑島二〇元，南昌一〇〇元，贛州一八〇元，嘉興一〇元，重慶成都各五〇元，叙府一二〇元，萬縣一八〇元，河南區一六〇元，雲南一〇〇元，其他各地不變。</p>
<h3>國行加强拋售效能　組委員會統籌辦理</h3>
<p>由劉攻芸負責召集</p>
<p>中央銀行爲加强拋售物資，吸收游資，抽緊銀根措施，增加運用所有物資之效能起見，擬成立物資委員會，由劉攻芸負責召集。今後所有物資之收購與拋售等事宜，統由該會統籌辦理。並悉對於以往由國行直接利用行總棉花與物資供應局剩餘物資等項利潤，將加以核算。同時行政院爲加强處理美售予我國剩餘物資工作，經決定物資供應局所有各項物資，得由國行購買運用。該行已着手籌商運用，蓋過去國行曾將一部份剩餘物資售予國外，獲取外匯，今後運用該項物資，亦將仍以爭取外匯爲原則。</p>
<h3>七季進口限額　數量將大減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：第七季進口限額數量將大减，如原棉生產器材及醫藥等物品，將根本取消。且因結匯證明書制度實行以來，出口情形不如預料之良好，而國庫外匯頭寸短少，今後進口所需之外匯將全由出口所得之外匯支付，故七季進口限額之其他項目，即使不與美援物資重複者，數量亦將减少。</p>
<h3>茶市脚地堅固</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，因天氣轉晴，故買戶各有前來垂詢，而執主盛於產價步砌，又以複製成本亦難抑低，態度遂仍帶俏，迨至收市，吐納談判終難圓滿，交易大都相持未開，價格巍站如昔，脚地鞏固非凡。茲悉連日以來，本市出口商屢接北非來電，據云對本年度珍個綠茶，頗有需要，惜出價慳吝，照此情形，過程暫難拓展。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>蘇州</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州七日電〕今日米價續漲，市塲做開上糙粳一七八〇萬元，次白米一九五〇萬元，門售議價一九九〇萬元，上白米暗盤高達二二〇〇至二三〇〇萬元。</p>

<p>成都</p>
<p>〔本報成都七日電〕蓉物價穩定，米雙石三二五〇萬。銀根奇緊，經警在市塲監視投機，並禁貼現，黑市匿跡。</p>

<p>棉紗市塲昨已恢復常態，本街及客帮稍有吸納，四十二支藍鳳細紗，九億九千至十億大關均有成交，水月九億八千萬，廿一支雙馬紗自七億五千至八億二千萬有做開，各紗市盤均比上週軋漲五六千萬至一億元。全日趨勢，二十支各檔中做開不多，冷門紗交易較旺，其餘十六支十支等粗紗均有成交，總計成交單五十六張，總成交額一百八十八件。</p>
<p>中紡昨日售紗五八〇件，共收回法幣四六〇六億。</p>
<p>棉布市况，因業中頭寸軋緊，有貨者趁高不乏吐售，客銷轉淡，同業採辦不多，市呈盤局。場外龍頭細布喊開二千六百二三十萬間略有授受，卒以二千六百萬站住，較上日回小二十萬元。其餘五福藍鷄及B字龍頭，均見軋低三四十萬至八九十萬元，四君子嗶嘰漂布及色布士林布等，互有升沉。</p>
<h3>絲綢均見平軟</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市始高後平，一二〇號金三馬有光，上午開盤喊價高至十三億元，旋因供多求少，不支下挫。午收降至十一億七千萬元即期價，隔日期喊十二億三千萬元。下午開盤十二億四千萬元，最大升至七千萬元，收盤降爲十二億元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市呈軟，B字等級崇德牌做開十四億二于五百萬元，款有二天期頭。C字喊價十四億元，高零担十三億五千萬元有成交，均與上日價較短三千萬元之譜。干經交易毫無，喊價昨亦稍疲。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市平疲，華强眞絲被面，上午收市即期六億四千五百萬元，下午行情在四千萬元左右。格子　縐棧單上午二百卅萬元，下午喊價無甚上落。華錦縐普通貨一百萬元有成交，民生四五寸格子呢廠盤四百萬元，其他綢貨，均告平穩。</p>
<h3>美援棉花運用問題　原則經已商定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗管會代理主委王嵐僧，於昨日公畢自京返滬。據談赴京有四項任務，第一爲美援棉花之運用問題，爲此特謁翁院長請示，將來美棉之分配，主要將根據各廠之生產能力，及其製品之外銷能力作公正之分配，主持分配之機構迄未決定，以紗管會可能性較大。其次爲物價之穩定問題，辦法仍不外拋售紗布及其他物資，以收縮通貨。第三任務爲討論軍布之供應問題，因事關國防機密，不便公開。第四爲請示紗管會今後之工作方針，工商部不久即有新決定，較之過去略有修正。</p>
<h3>供應華北東北需要　政府定購鉅額麵粉　五十萬包昨日已由農行簽訂合約</h3>
<p>—日內交貨每包四百五十萬元</p>
<p>糧食部委託農民銀行代購麵粉，農行業已籌備妥當，該行信託部並於六日開始與第四區麵粉業公會會員廠商簽訂合約，七日付款。首批訂購五十萬包，每包四百五十萬，十日內交貨。每包價款，分三天平均付給，每日付三分之一。據該行信託部負責人稱，政府爲維持麵粉業之生存，掌握物資，供應市塲，平抑物價，特委託本行代購麵粉。係採定貨方式，貨款先期付給。爲使各廠得購進原料，减輕利息負擔，及物價波動影響，四區麵粉業會員廠，分散上海·無錫·蘇州等處，所有價款，全由當地支用。</p>
<p>又據另悉，此次糧食部擬購之麵粉，數量極鉅，可能爲五百萬包。分在上海，漢口，重慶三區訂購，一部自購小麥，交由各廠代磨。漢口，重慶兩地，日內亦可開始辦理。重慶方面，以購進小麥爲主。此次訂購麵粉，全部供給華北之需要，仍以配售拋售兩種方式，供應市塲。所有貨款，由中央銀行負責撥付。</p>

<h3>關於免費防癆X光檢查　我們對記者貢獻意見</h3>
<p>如對胸部健康有懷疑應從連申請檢查</p>
<p>本報爲了提高國人對肺結核的警覺起見，從去年夏天起開始舉辦免費防癆X光檢查運動，我們的初衷，不是想完全撲滅肺結核這殺人不見血的惡魔，因爲「檢查」本身，就是一件消極的事情，然而我們要想使每一個申請檢查的讀者，讓他們肺部的健康情狀，完全揭露出來，從而使他們即時獲得預防和治療的機會。在去年的防癆檢查，從五月初開始，到七月底截止，合作的醫院是十一家。本年度我們爲了更廣泛的推展這個運動，合作的醫院，除去年的十一家醫院繼續參加外，又加了市立第三，中西撩養，中國療養，和平民醫院　四家，合計是十五家醫院。這樣使我們的服務地區，幾乎　及了整個的上海市。</p>
<p>從六月廿一日開始到今天，申請檢查的讀者，前後巳達二千餘人，其中除手續不齊的暫　辦理外，均經發給免費檢查劵，並分配與申請人鄰近的醫院，爲他們檢查。從今夭算起，離開一個月的親定期限，還有整整的十五天，檢查的名額，還有一千多名，烯望我們的讀者，踴躍申請參加　這次中山等十五家醫院與我們合作，並犧牲他們寶貴的醫療時間，熱誠爲讀者服務，值得我們感激和頌揚。</p>
<p>依如今的價格，X光檢查的費用，自一百萬至兩百萬元之問，假使檢查人數以三千人計，十五家醫院所議牲的診金是四五十億元的龐大數字。親愛的讀者，在朋天的本攔，你將要看到我們所刊登的第五次一申請書」，假使你懷疑到　部不健康的話，就請照意辦理申請的手續，過去有不少的申請者，未附寫明地址的回件信封或未附回件郵資，因爲格於定章，無法辦理，現在請你們重行申請或補齊手續，以便核寄檢查券。</p>

<h3>論傅統</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>近來罵中國傳統思想的人很多，大事都是反對派，也難怪，人人都有說不出的苦痛，總想尋出病根，這就輪到古人遭殃，好像小孩子跌到了要怨門襤一般，免不了咒咀一頓，甚至吐上兩口唾沫，跺跺脚。民國八年五四運動以後也曾有過這樣一個時期，隻手打孔家店的吳虞老先生，作「子見南子」大大刻薄了孔子的林語堂，都曾出過一陣風頭，但孔子仍舊是孔子。說是奪社會勢力太大固然不錯，然而舊貨色不完全是垃圾，大小還有些用處，則其不容一筆抹殺，亦是應有之義也。</p>
<p>本來尚論古人是很難的。莊子所說「子非魚安知魚之樂」乃是不折扣的名言，推論古代社會與思想，無論如何，免不了今日的主觀過濾作用，也就是仁者智者各有所見了。孔孟在當時，並不是「三頭六臂」，（湯永咸語也）而且是汲汲皇皇的碰運氣去的，——也就因爲這一點，有人說儒家是死要作官，官迷，果然不差；可是墨子的到處鼓吹，他的弟十也在各國執政，法家，縱横家的熱中，要比儒家還厲書，又怎麼說呢？我們不能以爲孔子生下來便是偶像，偶像乃是利用他的人把他故意弄成這副嘴臉的，於孔子又有什麼關係？若說孔門弟子專門巴結官做，那麼漢高祖之時，自有　兩生，寗願習禮孔林，不願隨叔孫通去作帮閒份子；各朝代的諂臣佞士固是很多，諍臣狂捐也頗有，錢牧齋到儀鳳門外迎接新主子，史閣部就在揚州殉節，而黃黎洲張蒼水之琉，何嘗不講理學？即如王陽明，顧炎武對之深惡痛絕，以爲亡國主因，實則姚江乃是文治事功兼備的，馬上馬下都來得，豈是無事袖手臨危一死之徒可以望其項背？若果從這些零星現象中去求結論，除非採取美國式的統計法，用科學比較，取決於百分比之多數，把全部二十五史都加分析才行，然而這裏却又發生了一問題，就是善惡是非的標準是也。人類的精神活動是最沒法範制的事，因此所謂道德觀念便不能準之四海，垂之百世了。譬如說，歷史中對於張獻忠，李自成，黃巢，洪秀全在五十年來有多少種看法，隨之而來的，就是曾胡左李之流的功過；那麼，即使要像美國人研究一個家族，一個社會集團那麼明細解　，殊亦有無從奏刀之苦矣！而况中國人是專喜歡作「子胥非孝子」「武穆非忠臣」一類翻案文章的民族呢？</p>
<p>孔子也曾和弟子講過：「汝爲若子儒，勿爲小人儒」，「賢者識其大者，不賢者識其小者」，這就是說，道高一尺，未嘗不可以魔高一丈，在小人儒的弟子口中，孔子也難免成爲委瑣不堪，試看孟子引孔子的話，多少是斷罩取義的？孟子固不是小人儒，然而各種學說之可以隨便解釋，則彰彰明甚。我們若說中國的傳統有孔子的思想在內，誠然不錯，而若說純然是孔子的思想，便把一切罪責全加在孔子頭上，乃至由此逆溯其私生活，其行動，無一不是足以影響於後世的混賬，則我不能不替孔子喊冤。橋生淮南則爲　，生淮北則爲枳，是很明白的比喩。儒家學說到今日，不知經過了多少次的變質，混合，與歪曲了；董仲舒要罷黜百家，這是繼承了孟子距詖辭放邪說的傳統，應合了漢代大一統的政治需要，難道這是孔子的嗎？論語書中，很少罵人到如此的，孟子所以那樣，恐怕是出於政治鬥爭；至於宋儒明儒的空疏理學，那又是印度哲學的戲法兒，孔子何曾講過什麼心性理氣，精微奧妙的東西！老實講，那時候的思想，也不進步不到這麼有體系，有條理，所以論語一書，全是雞零狗碎，日用飲食之常，正如孔子自己所云：「未能事人，焉能事鬼」者也。士大夫階級的來源不完全是孔子一人作俑，世界上沒有那麼大的巨人，一個人可以造成一個階層；主要還是生產進步，人類有了求知職發展智　的閒暇，於是多出這一類不以生產來謀生的人。孔子固然是，墨·韓·莊·老·管·商·公孫又何嘗不是？階層觀念與特色愈來愈深，終至顯明的成了對立；再加上外患，戰亂，天災等因素，使人人走入困窮，因而逐漸運用階層勢力，爭攘利權，貪汚肥己，越是赴會不安，此風不能戢，而此風之日劇不已，又助長了社會之不安，循環作用，眞乃可怕，道些恐怕都不是孔子在二千年前所及料的罷？</p>
<h3>送禮</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>一年以前，舉辦以茶點招待的婚禮，大致總不虧本，當天的收支，不只相抵，而且尚可贏餘；但是現在就不了</p>
<p>這理極其簡單：一年以前，送禮的『價格」以四萬元到十萬元爲一般標準；以四萬元言，當時可以買到兩條美國貨香烟，只要有兩個客人送四萬元，便可供給常夫所有客人的香烟；但是如今呢？送禮的以一百萬比較普通。買不着兩包三砲台。</p>
<p>當然，送禮的明知一百萬之數十分菲簿，但要是說兩百萬，則一般薪水階級，如果一個月有三個應酬，就要六百萬，難免覺得力不從心；打個折扣，送一百五十萬罷，然而這數目又嫌太不完整。</p>
<p>如果以一年前送十萬元爲準，那個時候可買白米一担；那麼彼時送慣十萬的，現在至少該送兩千萬（今日門售米價已達二千三四百萬），而事實上今日婚禮塲合中送上千萬的殊罕見，除了少數豪門。</p>
<p>因此，最近每次逢到送結婚禮，總使我猶豫半天，考慮者再，結果心有餘而力不足，封好了一包紅封袋，慚愧地寫上名字，又慚愧地跑到婚禮人家，急忙地向賬房處放掉，再到簽名處簽了名，就偷偷地溜走了，自覺送了這點薄禮，未免太刻，實在不好意思再消耗人家一份西點了。咸斯</p>

<p>據紐約先鋒論壇報估計，第二次世界大戰中新增的「字」約三萬個以上，但一部份已在戰後漸漸淘汰，美國的學者們正在研究那一些新字應當列入字典。</p>
<h3>莫札爾特之死</h3>
<p>— 浣人</p>
<p>被稱爲「音樂神童」的偉大音樂家莫札爾特的一世生活在貧困中，雖然他不必像莫泊桑那樣的裝死賴債，但是他在冬天裏竟沒有錢去買炭，只好把兩手插在襪子裏，縮在破陋的小屋中避冷。</p>
<p>這一代的音樂家就在饑餓，寒冷，和營養不良的煎迫下致患肺病而死，奠札爾特是短命的，死時他還只有三十六歲。他的出殯費一共只化了十元零三分，送葬時最初雖有六個人，但因在半路上下了一陣大雨，竟把這六個送葬的人都冲跑了，所以莫札爾特到外還是寂寞的。</p>
<p>可是，有人却說莫札爾特不是死於肺病，而是死在戰塲上的</p>
<p>據說莫札爾特和他的愛人葛多利亞道別後，便走上了職塲，在荒野中，在山谷間，率領養他的士兵衝殺。但是有一次，竟在一處山谷中迷了路，被敵人所埋伏着的軍隊捉住了，他們就用鞭打他，用脚踢他，逼迫他說出軍事秘密來，但他只閉上了眼睛不回答，因此，他便在鞭笞和脚踢下可憐地離開了這個世界。</p>
<p>據說，在臨死時他還呻吟地這樣的呌了幾聲：</p>
<p>「聖女，葛多利亞……」</p>
<h3>怪腳印</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>這件怪事發生在英國的德文郡，即使是最聰明的科學家和生物學家對此都無令人滿意的解釋。德文郡西鄉的人們說：在八十年前，魔鬼曾經親身在鄉下走過一遭！</p>
<p>那是一個隆冬的夜晚，天下大雪。第二天淸早，雪地上印着近一百哩長的奇異的蹄形的足跡，沿着阿克西河畔，不僅走過鄉村，並且竟越過房子，牆項，和草墩。有些人一開門竟發現足跡曾停在他們的門口。更使人驚訝的是：全部的足跡成爲一直綫。</p>
<p>消息一傳開，大家都趕出來瞧個究竟。隆冬的淸晨是酷寒的，所以雪還沒有融化，但是，那怪足跡却迅速的消失了。後來又發現這些奇異的足跡曾經越過兩哩闊的阿克西河口。</p>
<p>報章宣揚，議論紛紛。整個的鄉村都陷於驚惶不安之中。大家鎖了門躲在家裏，天一黑便不敢出大門一步。</p>
<p>接着，理論家紛求解釋；袋鼠，鼴鼠，狐狸，靑蛙，水獺，鵝，和野兎，都被推測爲怪足跡的主人。可是，眞相依然未能大白—因爲從足跡看來，那位夜行者是一個獨脚客。另外有一種解釋說：因爲富地非常接近海和河，所以可能是某種深海的生物偶然上來登陸遊逛。</p>
<p>但是，不管是野獸，水族，或者飛窩，總不可能有一種獨脚的生物在短促的雪夜中直行了一百哩路，並且還能够飛簷走壁。</p>
<p>那麼，足跡怎麼來的呢？誰留下的呢？人們對於不可解的謎常易歸諉於鬼怪，所以，德文郡的人們說：魔鬼走過他們的土地。</p>
<h3>最冷的電影院</h3>
<p>— 柳岸</p>
<p>像目前這種盛暑天氣，電影院如果沒有冷氣設備，資座是一定要打折扣的，試想幾百個人擠在一間窗戶嚴閉的房子中，豈不要「熱昏」嗎？</p>
<p>可是，在一處名叫伊伐洛的地方，近來卻開設了一家永遠冷颼颼的電影院，完全用不着冷氣設備—原因是：伊伐洛地方已在北極圈之北三百英里。那家電影院大槪也可以算是全世界最北的電影院了。到目前爲止，伊伐洛的觀衆最歡喜看的一部片子是以熱帶叢林爲背景的「泰山得子」。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>北平上海兩參議會同時開幕，兩市市畏同日（二十二）出席報告政事並答覆質詢，議員與市長之問答，各有妙詞，可稱異曲同工。</p>
<p>上海則有范議員而數吳市長做人「圓滑」，市長之解釋，則自云「從無任何派系，故辦事也不顧任何派系，此或爲圓滑一詞之由來。」投如此說，不但不「圓滑」，且皆極「方嚴」也。不辯之辯，移宮換羽，綰合自然，即見措詞之圖妙，此中國所謂「應答如流」西方所謂Smart　reply也。三國諸葛亮之「舌戰羣儒」，法國拿破崙之「口禦德將」，皆此才智。</p>
<p>「圓滑」非惡詞也。現代時事譯文及評述中更常用之。事機順利，（比順利二字尤佳）輒曰「圓滑進行」，去成功不邋；共對詞爲「摩擦」，爲「齟齬」，前途黯淡矣。勝利之初，英京之五強會議，若「圓滑」進行，圓滿結束，則歐亞各問題早巳解决，安有近三年之「治絲益紊」乎。甚矣「圓滑」之可貴也。以上指事機而言。至於「做人」，則「圓滑」自不足爲訓，而「方嚴」是否「直道難行」？亦復一言難盡。似須互相設身處地，特別研究，且議會以議事爲主，而修身處世，則爲個人行誼問題，以另選淸靜講學之地，作道義之切磋，較爲適宜。觀於北平議員之於北平市長，係以「人」與「事」相附麗，便不空洞，乃爲「言之有物」，無「文不對題」之病。兩相參較，得失分明。</p>

<h3>A Major Victory on the Central Plains Battlefield: Bandit Forces in the Yellow River Flood Area Completely Collapse; National Army Launches Extensive Land and Air Pursuit</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] The main bandit forces of Chen and Liu operating in the Yu-Dong (Eastern Henan) Yellow River flood area, specifically the Qi County area, suffered heavy casualties and completely collapsed on the night of the 6th. The National Army achieved a decisive victory. Chen’s bandit forces—the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns, as well as the Guangdong-Guangxi Rapid Column—and Liu’s bandit forces—the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns—totaling over 200,000 men, were operating in the Sui and Qi areas. The National Army, using the 25th, 75th, and 72nd Divisions as an inner core to attract the bandit forces, and employing the Qiu Qingquan, Hu Lian, Liu Ruming, and Sun Yuanliang army groups on the outer lines, coordinated with air power from the Yellow Sea, East Sea, and Bohai Sea to bravely encircle and fiercely annihilate the bandits. After nine days and nights of fierce fighting, bandit casualties are estimated at 100,000. The remaining bandits are fleeing in two directions: the majority toward Dingtao in western Shandong, and a portion southwest from the Sui-Qi area. The National Army is capitalizing on the victory and pursuing and suppressing the bandits along multiple routes.</p>
<p>"Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th" A military news agency dispatch from Kaifeng at 1:00 PM on the 7th urgently reported: The combined forces of Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng, totaling fourteen columns, along with local communists Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, and others, amounting to over 200,000 men, who had gathered between Tongxu in the south and Qi County and Sui County, have been engaged in battle for two weeks. The National Army, employing the strategy of linear warfare, combined powerful army groups with a strong air force to encircle and annihilate the bandits. In fierce fighting up to the 7th, the 4th and 6th Guangdong-Guangxi Columns of Chen Yi's forces were largely wiped out, and the 11th Column of Liu's forces, as well as the 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns and the Rapid Column of Chen Yi's forces, were completely routed. In total, approximately 80,000 bandits were annihilated, and captured weapons, ammunition, and military supplies were piled high like mountains. Bandit corpses littered the fields, and the National Army also sustained casualties. In addition, over 10,000 local communist bandits, including Wei Fenglou and Jin Shaoshan, were annihilated. The remaining bandits fled in disorder to the north and southeast. The National Army's various large armies and powerful air power are engaged in a widespread pursuit. This battle is truly an unprecedented major victory on the Central China battlefield, and detailed battle results are currently being verified.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xuzhou, 7th] The main battle in the Yellow River flood area of Henan, fought for seven days and nights, has come to an end. The bandits, suffering extraordinarily heavy casualties, began a full-scale collapse before dawn on the 7th. Apart from a portion of the remaining bandits remaining in the flood area to maneuver with the National Army, the majority have fled north across the Longhai Railway toward Cao County in western Shandong and Dongming in southern Hebei. In this major battle, the National Army's high command, in order to annihilate the bandit forces in one fell swoop, concentrated land and air forces, with General Commander Liu Zhi of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters and Deputy Commander Du Yuming directing operations in the air day and night. The Qiu, Huang, Liu, and Qu major army groups, in coordination with the Yellow Sea, East Sea, and Bohai Sea air power, bravely encircled and suppressed the bandits. After nine days and nights of bloody fighting, they repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the bandits and achieved significant success. According to official statistics, bandit deaths number around 100,000, especially those of the 1st, 4th, and 6th Columns of Chen Yi’s forces, which were known for their fighting strength.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The major battle in the Yellow River flood area of Henan, with the cooperation of land and air forces, lasting ten days of bloody and bitter fighting, has finally resulted in the annihilation of over 90,000 bandit soldiers, completing the encirclement and suppression and declaring a major victory. The 7th coincides with the first Army Day and the 11th anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War. When the news of the victory arrived, soldiers and civilians were inspired. The Central Daily News in Nanjing and the Military News Agency both issued extra editions, greatly boosting morale. It is widely believed that the bandit forces in the Central Plains, having suffered such a severe blow, will not be able to recover in the short term.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] When Xuzhou City heard of the major victory in eastern Henan, the whole city rejoiced, and all newspapers issued extra editions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Hankou, 6th] A certain unit of the National Army moving north along the Pinghan Railway had a fierce encounter battle with the 3rd Column of Liu’s bandits and the 4th, 8th, and 10th Columns of Chen Yi’s bandits between Shangcai and Shangshui on the 6th, which lasted all day. Upon hearing this, the local air force dispatched a large number of aircraft to assist in the battle, killing over five days' worth of bandits. On the same day, the National Army’s air power destroyed a medium-sized vehicle of the bandit forces on the highway south of Laohekou and north of Xianrendu.</p>
<h3>National Army Recaptures Tai’an; Battle for Yanzhou City Reaches Climax</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Jinan, 7th] After defeating the stubborn bandit resistance, the National Army outside Tai'an successfully captured Wolizhi, an important stronghold on the outskirts of Tai'an, at 12:00 noon on the 7th. At 3:00 PM, they recaptured Tai'an city.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Jinan, 7th] The battle for Yanzhou continues fiercely. On the night of the 5th, the bandits repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the southwest gates, but the National Army fiercely repelled them with strong fortifications. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, and the ancient city of Yanzhou remains standing unharmed.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The fierce fighting at the Yanzhou pass has reached a climax. From the night of the 6th, under the cover of concentrated artillery fire, the bandits concentrated their main forces to repeatedly launch fierce attacks on the southwest gates. In one night, casualties reached over a thousand. As of the morning of the 7th, fierce close combat was still ongoing at the southwest gates. Houyao, outside the south gate, was once invaded by bandits, but the National Army fiercely counterattacked and annihilated many bandits. Houyao is still held by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Busy Military Transportation on the Ping-Bao Railway; Remnants of Bandits Still Occupy Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Baoding, 7th] According to sources, military transportation on the Ping-Bao Railway has been busy since the 6th. Large army groups of the National Army are moving south, and the long-quiet Ping-Bao line will see new developments.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Qinhuangdao, 7th] Approximately three columns of bandits are still entrenched in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. The National Army is on high alert. The repair work between Houfengtai and Anshan, west of Changli, will be completed soon, and traffic between Tianjin and Yu may be restored on the 9th or 10th.</p>

<h3>Wuhu to Datong Section of River Blockaded; Over a Hundred Bandits Crossed the Yangtze from Wuwei</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Wuhu, 7th] Over a hundred communist bandits crossed the Yangtze River south of Wuwei County in Anhui province on the 5th, invading near Digang Town in Fanchang County. The garrison troops engaged them. The Wuhu military commander has dispatched reinforcements to annihilate these crossing communist bandits in one go. The river surface from Wuhu to Datong has now been blockaded, and all ships have been stopped. It is reported that the bandit force may be a unit left behind by Liu Bocheng’s bandit forces.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The hundred or so communist bandits who secretly crossed the Yangtze River and invaded Fanchang have been intercepted by the National Army. Preliminary battle results show that four bandits were killed and thirteen were wounded, and four rifles were captured. The bandits, led by a certain Chen, have ninety rifles and ten machine guns.

<h3>Shandong Province Forms Commissioner Inspection Team to Inspect the Tenth District Commissioner's Office in Hebei</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Jinan, 7th] The Shandong Provincial Government recently decided to form a commissioner inspection team and appointed Liu Zhence, commissioner of the Fourth District, and Xu Zhenzhong, commissioner of the Tenth District, to inspect the Tenth District Commissioner's Office in Hebei. They will depart in a few days. It is reported that Wang Fenggang, the commissioner of the Tenth District Commissioner's Office in Hebei, relies only on the strength of two security brigades to prevent the bandits from invading. His method of suppressing bandits is to implement a "three self" policy (self-government, self-defense, self-rule) by the people, placing the responsibility of suppressing bandits on the people themselves, with the government only providing guidance.</p>

<h3>"July 7th" First Army Day; He Yingqin Encourages Officers; Calls to Catch Up with the Era of Science and Technology</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The 7th is the first Army Day. Military organizations, units, and schools in the capital gathered at the National Defense Ministry Auditorium at 8:00 AM to celebrate. Minister He, Chief of Staff Gu, Army Commander-in-Chief Yu, commanders of the Navy, Air Force, Joint Logistics, and Garrison, deputy ministers of the National Defense Ministry, heads of various departments, bureaus, divisions, and offices, as well as officers above the rank of major and representatives from various units and schools, totaling over two thousand people, attended the solemn ceremony. Minister He presided over the ceremony and delivered a sincere speech, encouraging everyone to maintain the glorious history of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, to use the belief in the inevitable victory over the communist bandits to remove obstacles to national reconstruction, and to guarantee the success of national reconstruction. The Army must first achieve unity within itself and then achieve unity with the Navy and Air Force to accomplish the task of suppressing bandits and building the nation. It is especially necessary to continuously improve in battle to achieve modernization and scientificization to meet the new era and promote the glorious history of the Army. After the speech, slogans were shouted, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Today is the "July 7th" first Army Day. Minister He Yingqin delivered a speech to all officers, stating: "Our country's Army has designated the July 7th Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day as its own memorial day, which contains extremely profound significance and extremely serious warning. On this day eleven years ago, the Japanese invaders brazenly launched a war of aggression at Lugou Bridge, which was also the day our sacred Anti-Japanese War began. Relying on the wise leadership of our supreme commander, our Army, in cooperation with the Navy and Air Force, fought hard and finally achieved the final victory under conditions of material poverty and inferior equipment. In commemorating the first Army Day today, the glorious historical achievements of our Army comrades-in-arms who endured hardships, gallantly went to the enemy, and succeeded or died in service, with their loyalty shining brightly, cannot but be particularly emphasized. At the same time, we should also be particularly vigilant. Although military thinkers in various countries are now touting "button" warfare or the decisive role of the air force, they are still not neglecting the strengthening and reorganization of the Army. Because the final occupation still requires the Army. In today's atomic age, in today's era of rapidly improving aircraft performance, how should our Army strive to maintain, develop, and promote the glory of our Army is indeed worthy of our deep study. I believe that scientific progress will change the future of warfare, but I believe that the Army will absolutely have a glorious future. This all depends on all of our comrades-in-arms measuring the long-term prospects of scientific and morphological evolution, truly grasping the needs of reality, understanding the current shortcomings, and striving to improve. The glorious future of the Army will definitely be realized. Our country is a scientifically backward country. To make our Army completely modern, we still lack many conditions. We use "July 7th" as Army Day, which shows that we are absolutely not afraid of difficulties and will strive to catch up with the era of science and technology. At present, we are suppressing bandits and putting down the rebellion. Our conditions in all aspects are much more favorable than they were during the Anti-Japanese War. We must maintain the glorious history of enduring eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and finally achieving victory, and use the belief, perseverance, and determination to win the Anti-Japanese War to remove the obstacles on the road to national reconstruction and guarantee the success of national reconstruction."</p>

The Zhejiang Security Corps made great contributions during the Anti-Japanese War, and they will surely make great contributions in suppressing bandits.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Education Minister Zhu stated at the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee meeting on the afternoon of the 7th: The Ministry of Education was very uneasy after learning about the incident in which Northeast refugee students in Beiping smashed the Municipal Council and clashed with the police. It was decided to send a vice minister to Beiping within a few days to investigate and carefully handle the matter. He also explained that apart from a portion of the Northeast youth fleeing to Beiping having school documents, a portion could not prove their student status. Therefore, in order to reasonably distribute and accommodate them, it was decided to first undergo intensive training and screening before distributing them, which unintentionally caused disputes. Minister Zhu's attendance at the Professor Committee on the 7th was to continue to receive inquiries and answer questions. The meeting was chaired by Liu Hengjing. The focus of the committee members' questions was still on how to coordinate educational policy with social needs. Minister Zhu's answers were generally the same as in the previous meeting.

<h3>Salaries of Civil and Military Officials Adjusted According to Monthly Index; Implemented From This Month; Executive Yuan Passes Four Recommendations of the Index Evaluation Council; Responsible for Regulating People's Food in Each Province and City</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The method of adjusting the salaries of civil and military officials according to the monthly cost-of-living index was passed at the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 7th and will be implemented from July. The implementation of this adjustment method will greatly increase the burden on the national treasury, but the Executive Yuan has resolutely decided to do so in order to stabilize the lives of civil servants. Furthermore, this method was discussed, decided, and recommended by the Executive Yuan's Civil Service Cost-of-Living Index Evaluation Council on the 6th. The four methods are recorded as follows: (1) The method of investigating and compiling the cost-of-living index for civil servants in major cities and counties will remain the same. (2) Starting in July, the salary for the current month will be adjusted according to the cost-of-living index for the current month. The monthly cost-of-living allowance will be issued at the beginning of the month according to the standard approved for the previous month, and then recalculated after the payment standard for the current month is approved. The cost-of-living allowance for July will be issued in advance at 50% of the payment standard for June and recalculated after the payment standard is approved. (3) The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics will conduct a thorough investigation and compilation of the July index and submit it to the Council for evaluation. (4) Executive Yuan Order No. 30301 of (37) Yu Zi, dated June 29 of this year, stipulates that half a month's cost-of-living expenses should be borrowed in advance according to the June standard as an additional payment for June, and will no longer be deducted. This method has significantly improved the treatment of civil servants, and it was unanimously deemed reasonable when it was submitted for discussion at the political affairs meeting and was approved.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] In order to coordinate and regulate the people's food supply in various regions, to prevent food panic during the period of shortage between the harvest seasons, and to avoid affecting social order, the Ministry of Food has formulated measures to regulate the people's food supply.

Each provincial and municipal government is responsible for establishing a People's Food Allocation Committee to be responsible for the coordinated regulation of the local people's food supply. It is reported that the above measures have been passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 7th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Changsha, 7th] With soaring prices, the actual cost-of-living index for civil servants in June has exceeded one million times. Because agencies in Nanjing and Shanghai have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to increase it by half a month, the Hunan Provincial Government has also followed suit and issued half a month's salary for June as an additional cost-of-living allowance to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Rescuing Those Deprived of Education: Helping Students is the Greatest Joy</h3>
<p>Summer vacation has arrived. In the past, this was the happiest time for students, but now it has become the most depressing season: university graduates stare at "graduation is unemployment," middle school graduates immediately feel the difficulty of seeking employment, and also feel that the gates of universities are too high, and are also depressed because there is nowhere to go; as for the general middle and high school students still in the middle of their studies, there is a serious problem in their minds, which is the tuition problem for the next semester, which makes them worry so much that they cannot eat or sleep.</p>
<p>In today's era of soaring prices, except for a few wealthy merchants, most families across the country are feeling the threat to their livelihoods under the pressure of high prices, and are simply unable to afford the education of their children; moreover, the tuition fees of various schools must also follow the pace of prices, increasing every semester; although the fees for the next semester have not yet been decided, it is said that all schools will change to collecting tuition in rice, approximately six dan for universities and one dan for middle schools. Even if the current rice price is calculated at 20 million yuan per dan, the tuition fees for universities and middle schools next semester will reach about 100 million yuan; when school starts in September, it is not known how many times the price of rice will rise, just imagine how serious a threat this tuition problem is to middle and lower-class families! Therefore, most students during the summer vacation are worried about the tuition fees for the next semester, and no one is not panicked by the impending loss of schooling.</p>
<p>In principle, the right to education is a right that the younger generation of youth should enjoy, and our country's laws also have this provision; but in today's difficult times, in addition to basic education, it is impossible for the government to fully assume the responsibility of educating the next generation of youth. Therefore, youth deprived of education must rely on the assistance of all sectors of society. In view of this, our newspaper launched the "Readers Helping Students Movement" as early as January of this year, appealing to all sectors of society to generously help students for the vast number of youth deprived of education. As a result, a total of 700 million yuan in student aid funds were raised, rescuing more than 500 university and middle school students, allowing them to continue their studies with peace of mind. We certainly cannot be satisfied with this, but the initial attempt was able to achieve such achievements, which gave us infinite warmth and increased our infinite courage, making us have to continue to work hard and ask society for help for the vast number of youth deprived of education.</p>
<p>This time, our fundraising goal for student aid is tentatively set at 10 billion yuan, hoping to rescue 500 university and middle school students so that they will not lose their schooling due to expensive tuition fees; for the vast number of youth deprived of education, it is inevitable that it will feel like a drop in the bucket, but in today's declining industry and commerce, it is not an easy task to raise 10 billion yuan in a short period of time; and the real purpose of our launch of the "Readers Helping Students Movement" is not the amount of student aid funds raised by our newspaper, but to create a general atmosphere of "helping students is the greatest joy" in society. As long as people from all walks of life are willing to donate funds to rescue youth deprived of education, no matter what the method is, regardless of whether it is handled through our newspaper, we sincerely welcome it.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Improving Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>Before the war, the total amount of overseas remittances was as high as 300 million US dollars per year, while Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan recently reported in the Legislative Yuan that it was as high as 100 million and as low as 50 million US dollars per year; this is quite different from the usual estimates, but it also recognizes the importance of its position in international finance.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate and settlement methods have been changed several times, and each change has been made under the pretext of absorbing overseas remittances and promoting exports. In fact, it is indeed expected that these two figures will increase. Because import restrictions have been reduced again and again, to the point where they can no longer be reduced, and foreign exchange funds are becoming increasingly depleted, and most of the US aid is in the form of materials, which cannot be used for this purpose. Unless efforts are made to expand from the source, the import trade, production equipment, and industrial raw materials will be difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>However, although the call for absorbing overseas remittances is extremely high, in reality, it is getting worse and worse, decreasing rather than increasing. Finance Vice Minister Xu said: 35 years was more than 32.32 million US dollars, 36 years was only more than 20.1 million, and now it is less than 500,000 US dollars per month. This is such a miserable thing! But this is not due to the real decrease in overseas remittances, but due to the massive increase in evasion. In Hong Kong, the concentration of overseas Chinese funds, and in the Guangdong and Guangdong provinces, the booming of private letter offices for remittances, this is a common sight. Therefore, the decrease in the number of overseas remittances in recent years only proves that the authorities' methods of absorption are not appropriate, and it is not that the source of overseas remittances has dried up. In other words, most of these funds were forced to flow elsewhere. Although the financial authorities have very sincere hopes for these funds, their methods can certainly be said to drive them away, not to attract them. How do you see it? When analyzing the reasons for the decrease in overseas remittances, President Yu of the Central Bank himself stated that it was because the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market was too large. Chairman Liu of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also said that because the official price was too different from the free market price, the value of the currency was depreciated when it was remitted back to the motherland, which led to evasion. It can be seen that the reason why overseas remittances were evaded was that the overseas Chinese suffered too much, and the reason why they suffered so much was that the official price was too low. In addition, there were no major problems. But the authorities knew the reason, but they still refused to revise a reasonable exchange rate, allowing these overseas remittances to escape to other places in various ways. Isn't this intentional expulsion?</p>
<p>Since the authorities want to absorb overseas remittances, why do they actually harass them? This is the subtle point of the issue, and also the subtle point of all economic policies. The original consistent policy of the authorities is to only care about the present, only greedy for immediate gains, only make small calculations, and are unwilling to plan overall and calculate the consequences for the future. This is not only the case with overseas remittances. For example, they only know to increase tax rates and increase income, but they do not realize that it affects the tax base; they only know to repay the principal at 60% of the gold reserves, but they do not realize that it affects credit; they only know to suppress prices to purchase and increase profits, but they do not realize that it affects reproduction; they only know to sell at high prices to enrich the treasury, but they do not realize that it stimulates prices; they only know to reduce the index and save expenses, but they do not realize the lives of public and education personnel; they only know to suppress the official exchange rate in order to receive overseas remittances and export bills of exchange, and naturally they do not realize smuggling and evasion.</p>
<p>Now that we have learned from the pain, we know that it is necessary to encourage overseas capital to return to the country, and we have formulated three measures that will soon be implemented. We hope to learn from the past and avoid the mentality of exploitation. As the saying goes, "The heart of the people is like water flowing downwards." As long as the actual income of overseas Chinese is not much different from the black market income, we do not believe that they will definitely try to evade. If there is a planned suppression and the policy remains unchanged, but the methods are changed, we believe that no matter how it is changed, it will not achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>The inflow of overseas capital is to replenish foreign exchange and exchange for materials, and its benefits lie above the additional benefits obtained by the government at the time of settlement. Therefore, for these remittances, whether they are purchased at a special price or given preferential treatment, the key is still whether they conform to the free market price. Now there are more imported goods and fewer exported goods, and the supply of bills of exchange is obviously far from meeting the demand. We believe that any imported goods, as long as they have been applied for in accordance with the law, obtained permission, and do not violate the regulations on trade management, all overseas remittances and self-provided foreign exchange can be allowed to handle the import of goods, so as to increase investment. It must be known that the value of foreign exchange is different from that of the national currency, but its main function is still no more than a medium of exchange, that is, its ultimate purpose is not the preservation of foreign currency, but the acquisition of foreign materials. Therefore, the import of materials is no different from the inflow of foreign exchange. In the past, emphasizing capital and neglecting materials, and insisting on capital while rejecting materials, cannot but be said to be a psychological illusion. At the time of improving overseas remittances, we hope that all policy, technical, and psychological errors can be completely corrected.</p>
<h3>Yan Jiagan Talks About the Use of US Aid, Emphasizing Production and Construction, Recovering a Part of Currency to Stabilize the Economy</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yan Jiagan, liaison commissioner of the US Aid Utilization Committee, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 6th. Our reporter paid a special visit yesterday. According to the conversation, the US aid this time focuses on domestic production and construction, so as to achieve the goal of self-reliance. At the same time, it is hoped that the use of US aid can have an anti-inflationary effect on the country. Selling US aid materials and recovering a part of the currency to stabilize the economy is particularly urgent. He said that the US Aid Utilization Committee is a comprehensive and powerful organization that negotiates decisions and is responsible for promoting them. However, when implementing business, it uses the original organization, so although the responsibility of the Utilization Committee is heavy, the organization is not large.</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Yan accompanied the Steelman Investigation Team to various places for investigation, lasting a total of twelve days, passing through Hankou, Daye, Wuchang, Changsha, Zhuzhou, Pingxiang, Xiangtan, Hengyang, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Pingtung, Taipei and other places. He said: The three major aid sectors in this US aid are: one is Shanghai United Power Company, the second is the Yuehan Railway, and the third is the coal mines on both sides of the Yuehan Railway. In order to understand the facts, the US Economic Cooperation Administration set up an investigation team. The purpose is to investigate whether the established US aid plan is practical and feasible, and whether there are technical revisions. In addition, general related businesses are also given attention at the same time. The results of this investigation are still in the stage of exchanging opinions. Steelman's investigation report is expected to be submitted to the US Economic Cooperation Administration this month. Although the time for this trip was very tight, our country has provided as much information as possible, so as far as the investigation itself is concerned, it should be said to be satisfactory. He finally said that the purpose of the investigation is to study how to make US aid produce the greatest and most effective results for China's construction.</p>

After searching, there is no provision that the Municipal Council can make such a resolution; but the students are also wrong, they should not take action that goes beyond the rules against the Sanji Association.

<h3>Minister Chen Zhiping Visits Philippine President to Discuss Ways to Improve Entry for Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th] Our ambassador to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, met with Philippine President Quirino today to discuss the issue of handling the 4,500 overseas Chinese who previously resided in the Philippines. They returned to China due to the war, which prevented them from enjoying the rights of immigration laws to return to the Philippines. 2,000 overseas Chinese who returned to China in 1941 have now been allowed to return to the Philippines, with a provision for 100 people to immigrate each month, of which 75 are from Xiamen and the rest are from eastern China. Minister Chen believes that the monthly immigration number is too small and specially suggested to the Philippine President that 250 people be allowed to immigrate each month. It is reported that the Philippine President told Mr. Chen that he would study this issue. Mr. Chen also asked the Philippine President to reconsider the overseas Chinese who returned to China from 1937 to 1940 and allow them to return to the Philippines, according to the previous recommendation of the International Refugee Organization to the Philippine government to handle the homeless overseas Chinese who once traveled to the Philippines and are now in China under the care of the organization, but no results have been obtained.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Wartime Public and Private Losses Temporarily Difficult to Implement, To Be Handled After the Total Amount of Japanese Reparations is Determined</h3>
<p>[Local News] Regarding the issue of how to compensate the people for losses during the War of Resistance, the Municipal Council, based on the suggestions of the citizens last month, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting that a portion of the Japanese reparations materials that have been dismantled and transported back be designated for compensating the people's losses. After research by the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan, the Council was replied to yesterday with a proxy telegram Jing Er Zi No. 6114, stating: "1. China's War of Resistance lasted for a long time, and the areas that suffered destruction were extensive. The losses were huge, and the situation was extremely complex. The government should attach equal importance to the public and private losses in various places during the War of Resistance, without making any distinctions. Currently, the total value of materials available for compensation from Japan and how they will be distributed among the Allied countries have not been determined. If compensation is implemented with the limited materials that have been dismantled and transported back, it is practically impossible to distribute them fairly. Forcing it will be difficult to ensure fairness. Based on the above reasons and other relevant technical issues, how to compensate for public and private losses across the country must wait until the total amount of compensation that China receives from Japan is determined, and a separate method is announced before it can be handled accordingly."</p>

<h3>US Mediterranean Fleet Mobilized Under Emergency Order from European Headquarters, Navy Department Says Unrelated to Holy Land Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 7th, broadcast: Seven US warships left Istanbul and Naples today for "routine" activities in the Mediterranean. The US Navy Department stated that this action by the US fleet is absolutely unrelated to the situation in Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] US warships in Mediterranean ports such as Istanbul, Naples, and Villefranche, France, sailed 24 hours earlier than scheduled yesterday, heading towards a tea area in the Mediterranean. Those departing from Villefranche, France, included the 45,000-ton battleship "USS Missouri."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Powerful warships of the United States stationed in Mediterranean ports were suddenly summoned today to an undisclosed location, 72 hours before the expiration of the Palestinian truce. The cruisers "USS Fargo," "USS Huntington," and "USS Juneau," originally in Istanbul, set sail from Istanbul a day earlier today. Well-informed sources said this was due to the situation in Palestine. The cruiser "USS Kearsarge," a destroyer, and a supply ship also hurriedly left Naples a day earlier for an undisclosed location. Some crew members who were sightseeing in Rome did not make it back to the ship.</p>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, 7th] US warships anchored here and in the port of Naples, Italy, suddenly left port yesterday after receiving emergency orders, destination unknown. Some said they were heading to Palestine, Trieste, and Crete, but opinions varied. According to well-informed sources, the US Navy believes that it is wiser for US warships to remain at sea, hence this decision. Others said that this was due to the serious breach of the Palestinian armistice agreement, and it may be necessary to evacuate nationals. However, the US Navy in Washington stated that the movement of these US warships is absolutely unrelated to the Palestinian issue. The aircraft carrier "USS Palau" arrived here not long ago and set sail for the eastern Mediterranean yesterday morning, followed by three cruisers of the Sixth Task Force. The three ships were originally scheduled to leave port on the 7th, but the fleet commander, Heumann, received several urgent telegrams from the commander of the US Atlantic Fleet in London yesterday and temporarily changed his plan. According to well-informed sources, they were heading to the waters near Crete to await developments. Four other US warships sailed south from Naples. Naval police entered the city late at night to search for US soldiers. It was reported that at least ten people were left behind and did not make it on board.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Fighting Erupts Again, Bernadotte's Chief of Staff Shot, French Truce Observer Dies of Gunshot Wounds</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Today is the deadline set by Bernadotte for both the Jewish and Arab sides to respond to his proposed extension of the truce. Bernadotte will submit the responses of both sides to the Security Council for discussion. Reports of actions violating the truce order have been confirmed by Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Colonel Pant, Bernadotte's Chief of Staff, was shot while negotiating a local truce near an Arab village twelve miles south of Haifa yesterday, apparently from Arab army positions. The Jewish side also stated that Iraqi troops and Arab guerrillas had fired on vehicles on Jewish roads, and Jewish armored vehicles immediately rushed to reinforce them. According to Lake Success: United Nations authorities announced that the United Nations truce observer, French Major Labourie, was shot and wounded while investigating truce violations twenty miles southeast of Haifa and died yesterday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 7th] Jewish and Arab forces engaged in fierce fighting today along the main highway between Tel Aviv and Haifa, while UN mediator Bernadotte was making final efforts to extend the truce. Bernadotte declared here that if the proposal to extend the truce is rejected, consultations should continue. The highway fighting began last night on Israeli territory between Tira and Yeba, about ten miles north of Haifa. The telephone line between Tel Aviv and Haifa has been cut. Two US Marines driving a UN monitoring team truck were stopped by Arab forces, who opened fire on them for forty minutes before stopping after the US troops waved a white flag. American photojournalist McCluer drove from Tel Aviv to Haifa via back roads and was also shot at by Arab forces about twenty miles south of Haifa.</p>
<h3>Security Council Fails to Reach Agreement on Extending Holy Land Truce</h3>
<p>Arabs and Jews Will Formally Respond</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 6th] While Bernadotte was telegraphed to extend the Holy Land truce, the entire Palestinian issue erupted into crisis again in the Security Council today. Although the issue was not on the agenda of the Security Council today, Bernadotte's telegram triggered a preliminary war of words in the meeting, with each member state holding different opinions. Britain and the United States strongly urged the Security Council to take swift measures to extend the Palestinian truce, which had only three days remaining, believing that this action should be taken immediately without debating the substantive issues of Arab-Jewish negotiations and Bernadotte's peace proposals. On the other hand, the Soviet Union and Ukraine believed that the decision to postpone could not be "reached alone," and therefore advocated a full debate on the entire Palestinian issue. Although the Soviet and Ukrainian sides did not oppose extending the truce, they intended to expose Bernadotte's peace proposals to the Security Council. Bernadotte's proposal advocates that the city of Jerusalem should be governed by Arabs rather than an international regime, and that the borders of Arab and Jewish countries should be greatly modified.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Jews and Arabs have already rejected Bernadotte's Palestinian peace proposals, and the deadline for Bernadotte's proposal to extend the truce is also the 7th. If both sides reject it again, a meeting of the Security Council must be convened to consider appropriate action. Bernadotte flew from Tel Aviv to Cairo on the afternoon of the 6th to receive the Arab response to the extension of the truce. He is scheduled to go to Tel Aviv again on the 7th to receive the Jewish response. It is generally predicted that the Israeli government will accept the extension of the truce. However, the attitude of the Arabs is still in doubt.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said: Five British people were kidnapped by members of the Jewish Irgun group from the UN Truce Commission flag building in Jerusalem County. The British government attaches great importance to this matter and demands the immediate release of these five people. The spokesman did not reveal the names of the five people.</p>
<h3>Arab Representatives Withdraw from Security Council Venue</h3>
<p>Protest Soviet Union's Indirect Recognition of Jewish State</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 7th, broadcast: Arab representatives withdrew from the Security Council meeting venue today to protest the Soviet Union's attempt to indirectly recognize the State of Israel. The Soviet and Ukrainian representatives referred to the Jewish representatives as representatives of the "State of Israel" during the meeting today, which is tantamount to recognizing the status of "Israel," which immediately aroused opposition from China, Britain, Syria, Belgium, and Canada, but because it did not reach a majority, it was not established.</p>
<h3>World Jewish Congress Closes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Montreux, Switzerland, 6th] The Seventh World Jewish Congress closed this morning. Communist and anti-communist representatives argued over the organization of the Council and the Executive Committee without reaching a conclusion. Representatives from Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria refused to participate in the Council and the European Regional Executive Committee, therefore they were unable to participate in the Executive Committee of the American region.</p>
<h3>Support Eisenhower Group, Refuse to Give Up Nomination</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th, Associated Press] Many members of the US Democratic Party who support Eisenhower's candidacy for president have refused to give up their goal, even though Eisenhower has bluntly stated that he "cannot accept" the nomination. Most of his supporters do not believe that he will refuse to accept if the party's national conference nominates him next week.</p>
<h3>Bulganin Arrives in Berlin, Three Powers Protest, Await Soviet Response</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] Sources close to the Soviet military government said that Marshal Bulganin, a member of the Soviet Politburo and Minister of the Armed Forces, has arrived in Berlin. Sokołowski's chief political advisor, Zhechev, has been recalled to Moscow and replaced by General Gribanov. In the past few months, Soviet politicians have frequently traveled between Berlin and Moscow. It has been rumored that the change of Sokołowski's political advisor is related to the reorganization of the Soviet military government in Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Well-informed sources here believe that the notes that Britain, the United States, and France sent to the Soviet Union today are not in the nature of an ultimatum, nor do they suggest what steps the Western countries will take if the Soviet Union refuses to lift the blockade. Well-informed sources also believe that unless the Soviet Union gives a definite indication that it is prepared to break the deadlock, the Western countries do not intend to hold a four-power conference to re-discuss the German issue. The decision by the Western countries not to have the four-power military commanders in Germany engage in negotiations, but to have the four governments negotiate directly, has brought the Berlin dispute into a new and broader stage. According to a Washington dispatch, American diplomatic observers attach great importance to the fact that the Three Powers' Soviet note was delayed for several days to allow the Soviet Union a reasonable time to respond. It is expected that the note from the Three Powers has suggested some definite actions that the Soviet side should take. If the Soviet side ignores them, the Western powers will take decisive action.</p>
<h3>Soviet Warplanes Active in the Skies Over West Berlin</h3>
<p>Britain and the United States Step Up Airlift of Food and Coal</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 7th, broadcast: A British transport plane supplying Berlin with food was surrounded by several Soviet aircraft today and deliberately rammed. The Soviet Union has warned the Allied side that if Allied aircraft linger outside the air corridor, they will be forced to land.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th, Associated Press] British and American aviators have been warned this evening that Soviet fighter planes are active near the air route between the Western Allies and Berlin. Therefore, British and American aviators need to fly above 5,000 feet and must fly within the air route. It is believed that this action by the Soviet side is a preliminary action to force the Western Allied aircraft to fly away from the existing air route.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] British and American aircraft have stepped up the airlift from West Germany to Berlin. The amount of food delivered yesterday was over 1,000 tons. As food reserves are gradually increasing, several American four-engine aircraft have begun to be converted to carry coal.</p>

<h3>Berlin Currency War Troubles City Government Officials, Salaries Unpaid, Pockets Empty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] The Soviet military headquarters summoned the treasurer of the Berlin city government today and told him that from the mayor down, all city government officials cannot be paid their salaries until the political situation becomes clear. The city treasurer had previously requested the Soviet military government to allow him to withdraw 900 million marks from the bank for salaries and other expenses. According to the Soviet currency reform law, these deposits can be converted into East German new marks at the same value. July 1st was originally the day for paying salaries, but it has not been paid to this day due to currency reform, and most officials' pockets are empty. Political figures in West Berlin believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the city government to withdraw bank deposits is another measure to force this city government, which largely holds anti-communist views, to withdraw from the Soviet zone and move to the Western zone. The Soviet authorities also summoned Sol, the speaker of the Berlin city council, of the Social Democratic Party, this afternoon. He is scheduled to convene an emergency meeting of the city council on the 7th to discuss this new action by the Soviet authorities.</p>

<h3>Over a Hundred Transportation Workers Laid Off; Buses Stoppage Temporarily; Negotiation Continues Today After Petitioning Fails</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Utility Bureau's Public Transportation Company suddenly announced yesterday that 72 drivers from the 21st class and 125 ticket sellers from the 18th class would be placed on unpaid leave. In addition to petitioning the Social Bureau and the Public Utility Bureau for relief, the laid-off drivers and ticket sellers went to the intersection of Central West Road and Huashan Road, Jing'an Temple, and the Bund Central Park at 3:30 PM, blocking the operation of bus lines 3, 9, 10, 4, 11, 6, and 15, and expanding publicity to seek the sympathy of other employees. Upon hearing the news, Wang Zongshan, head of the Transportation Section, and Ding Weitang, deputy head, rushed to the major stopping stations to persuade them. Lines 4, 11, 6, and 15 soon resumed operation, and lines 9, 10, and 3 also resumed operation around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Transportation Company recruited drivers and ticket sellers in Shanghai and Hangzhou on April 1st. On April 24th, the recruited workers received short-term training, and on May 5th, they were assigned to serve the traffic vehicles for the National Games, with a basic salary of 43 yuan, which was issued according to the workers' cost of living index. These drivers and ticket sellers originally had jobs, but because the company repeatedly assured them that they would not be suspended unless there were major mistakes or incurable diseases after serving, everyone resigned from their original jobs and settled down to work for the company. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 PM yesterday, Wang Zongshan, head of the Transportation Section, suddenly announced the order of Zhao Jian, chairman of the committee, stating that due to sluggish business and difficulties in obtaining gasoline, drivers from number 1010 to number 1085 and ticket sellers from number 1050 to number 1179 would be placed on unpaid leave, each receiving half a month's salary, approximately 15 million yuan, and those returning to Hangzhou would receive a third-class train ticket. This order would take effect from the 8th. Upon hearing this news, the laid-off drivers and ticket sellers were shocked and protested loudly, saying that if there was no need to increase workers in the past, they should not have been recruited. If they were recruited, their jobs should be guaranteed and they should not be suspended casually. At a time when there are many unemployed people, it is a sudden announcement of suspension. With no preparation for a career change, life will be in panic, and they requested the authorities to withdraw the order. Wang, the section chief, immediately explained the company's difficulties, and said that this was a decision made by the higher authorities and could not be reversed. If the company's business recovers in the future, they will be given priority. Seeing that there was no result, the workers gathered more than a hundred people (not including the night shift and those scattered in various places), and took four buses to petition the Social Bureau.</p>
<p>Representatives Petition to Describe Suffering</p>
<p>The petitioning workers arrived at the Social Bureau at about 4:00 PM and sent four representatives to visit Director Wu, who was received by Section Chief Fan Zhenbang. According to the representatives, the company's sudden measures put the workers' lives in dire straits. The severance pay of 15 million yuan can only buy seven dou of rice, and finding a new job is extremely difficult. They also bitterly complained about the company authorities' divisive policies towards workers. A company of more than 3,000 workers still does not have a labor union. Section Chief Fan expressed his sympathy for the workers' situation, but said that the company belongs to the Public Utility Bureau, and if you have any suffering, you should first appeal to the Public Utility Bureau. He will report your petition to Director Wu, and Director Wu will discuss a proper solution with Director Zhao.</p>
<p>At about 5:00 PM, the petitioning drivers and ticket sellers decided on two measures in the square of the Social Bureau: (1) Gather the remaining 70 or 80 laid-off workers who have not arrived at the scene, and form a temporary committee to appeal to all relevant parties. (2) Petition Director Zhao of the Public Utility Bureau immediately. At 5:15 PM, the petitioning workers still took four buses to the Public Utility Bureau.</p>
<p>Request One Year of Severance Pay</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Public Utility Bureau, Director Zhao was holding a review meeting on electricity allocation with representatives of various electricity companies. More than 190 people gathered on the stairs and corridors and refused to leave, and wrote slogans everywhere with chalk, such as "We want to eat" and "Oppose unconditional layoffs." At 6:30 PM, Wang Zongshan, the section chief, and Ding Weitang, the deputy section chief, arrived one after another, lectured the workers, and persuaded them to return to the factory to talk. All the petitioning workers left the Public Utility Bureau at 7:05 PM and returned to the factory with Section Chief Wang, and sent representatives to negotiate with the company authorities. The workers demanded one year's severance pay per person if they were not allowed to continue working. This dispute had not been resolved until late at night, and negotiations will continue today.</p>
<p>Company Expresses Hardships of Layoffs</p>
<p>According to the company, the emotions of other workers are good and not affected at all, and vehicles on each line can operate normally today. It is said that this batch of field workers were recruited into the company in this city and Hangzhou on April 4, with ticket sellers from number 1050 to number 1179 (including five who voluntarily resigned midway) totaling 125 people, and drivers from number 1010 to number 1085 totaling 72 people, for a total of 197 people, who are the newest of all the company's employees. In the investigation report submitted by the Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Council, the Public Transportation Company was said to have too many employees, and the company authorities also believed that the business situation was not good and the income and expenditure could not be balanced, so there was this layoff of field employees. The company also has unavoidable difficulties. These workers have been trained by the company and are all excellent people. When the company's business improves in the future, they will still need to be recruited and reused. This temporary suspension is unpaid leave, which is different from dismissal.</p>

He came to Shanghai by night train yesterday (6th), so he specially invited leaders from all walks of life in the city to celebrate the ambassador's birthday, and only represented the citizens of the city to pay tribute to the ambassador, and wished Sino-US relations to last forever. Furthermore, today is the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day, and it is even more meaningful for us to gather together. After Pan finished his speech, Ambassador Stuart stood up and delivered a reply in Chinese, saying: What the speaker said about China being his second home is very correct. He asked himself, whether running a school or serving as an ambassador, the only purpose was to enhance Sino-US relations. Today, he can sincerely say on behalf of the American people and government that the only hope of the United States is to have a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic China, which is completely consistent with the efforts of your country's patriotic people. The ambassador finally expressed his sincere thanks to the speaker for the hospitality. The banquet ended at about 9:00 PM. Ambassador Kai has decided to go to Beijing this morning (8th).</p>

<h3>Strictly Punish and Collect Business Tax: Finance Bureau Formulates Spot Check Methods; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Report Accurately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Director of the Finance Bureau, Tian Yongqian, hosted reporters from this city at the Municipal Bank Building at 7:00 PM last night, reporting that after the salaries of civil servants were adjusted monthly, the municipal finances had entered the most difficult stage. According to the income and expenditure report from January to June, the tax revenue can increase by about 30% on average each month, and the expenditure part is also calculated to increase by 30%. It is estimated that the income and expenditure offset each other. From July to December, the estimated loss for six months is close to 6 trillion yuan. Fortunately, the Council can deeply understand this, and during this meeting, the resolution was reviewed and resolved that the business tax rate in this city should be implemented according to the new tax law from the autumn of this year, and the bureau should be ordered to speed up the reporting and strictly spot check. Now, in order to increase the treasury revenue, the Finance Bureau has decided to strictly implement spot checks and has formulated spot check methods. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Main Points of Spot Check</p>
<p>(1) The bureau's future inspection methods should be based on the price index. If the report of a certain company in an industry is not in compliance, this company will be strictly investigated. If ten companies' reports are not truthful, ten companies will be strictly investigated. If an industry's report is not truthful, this industry will be given priority for spot checks, and chain accounting methods may be used to verify the truth. (2) Regarding the organization of the spot check personnel, those who are knowledgeable in commercial accounting, have high work efficiency, and are of honest integrity have been selected to go to various firms to conduct on-site strict inspections in groups, and senior officials have been assigned to supervise them in rotation. (3) If any firm makes a false declaration or forges account books in an attempt to evade taxes, it will be severely dealt with by the court once it is verified. (4) If any firm has not declared according to its actual turnover before the summer of this year, or has discovered after the declaration that there was a missed report in a certain quarter in the past, the bureau may still allow it to make a supplementary declaration or include it in the summer turnover of this year, and will not impose penalties leniently. (5) In the past, many firms did not pay attention to the reporting deadline stipulated by the bureau. In the future, in addition to strictly punishing the late reporting firms according to law, the bureau will also check their account books in advance to warn against cunning.</p>

<h3>Second Term Conscription: Quota of 4,000</h3>
<p>The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense yesterday stipulating that the quota for the second term of conscription in this city in the 37th year of the Republic is 4,000, which, together with the quota of 6,000 in the first term, totals 10,000.

<h3>Discovery at Jiaotong University: Communist Propaganda</h3>
<p>Police Bureau Investigating</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the Police Bureau received a confidential report stating that a large-scale communist propaganda piece titled "Letter from Exiled Students" was openly posted on the student union bulletin board opposite Wenzhi Hall at Jiaotong University. The letter was attributed to five individuals: Tan Xiyi, Yang Caicheng, Qiu Youan, Hu Zheng, and Zhang Gongwei, and its content distorted facts to propagate communist ideals. Upon receiving the report, the Police Bureau dispatched officers late at night to remove the poster. An investigation revealed that Tan and the other four individuals were all covert communist operatives assigned to Shanghai Jiaotong University. Tan, Yang, Qiu, and Hu were expelled by the university in August of the 36th year (1947), while Zhang Gongwei fled to communist-controlled areas on March 30th of last year (1948). The Police Bureau, considering the open posting of such a notice on the Jiaotong University student union bulletin board a clear violation of the Emergency Regulations for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, has sent a letter to Jiaotong University to investigate who received the original letter, its current location, and who transcribed and posted it, in order to pursue the matter.</p>
<h3>High Grain Prices Rooted in Production Areas; Alarming Grain Hoarding Quantities in Wuxi; Telegram Request Sent to Executive Yuan to Order Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu informed reporters yesterday that grain hoarding in the city has sharply decreased under the strict surveillance of the authorities. However, the city government recently received reports of rampant hoarding in Wuxi. Investigations revealed that 350,000 dans of rice and 750,000 dans of grain are being hoarded in Wuxi warehouses, along with large quantities of wheat and flour. Upon hearing this news, Mayor Wu sent a telegram yesterday to Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, requesting that he forward the message to Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang Maogong, ordering a thorough investigation of this grain hoarding and forcing the release of the hoarded grain to stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Members of the Human Rights Protection Committee Visit Shanghai Prison; In "Loyalty" Cell Blocks, Inmates Display Different Demeanors</h3>
<p>Prison Workshop Fully Equipped; Inmate Workers Appear Neat; Library and Counseling Room Established, Literacy Classes Offered, Transformation Education Provided</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Members of the Municipal Council's Human Rights Protection Committee, Qu Yue, Zhao Junhao, Chen Baotai, Zhou Feicheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Hou Jiyuan, along with Chief of General Affairs Section Bu Shenghua, Editor Li Benkuan, and several Chinese and foreign journalists, visited the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison yesterday afternoon. They were accompanied by Warden Kong Xianglin on a tour of the "Loyalty" cell blocks, dining hall, and workshops. The prison's interior gave a generally clean impression. The "Loyalty" cell blocks housed inmates convicted of treason and corruption. Two prisoners were confined to each cell. Some sat blankly, others read books, some used wooden boards as desks to practice calligraphy, and some faced the wall, unwilling to show their faces. The cell floors were wooden platforms raised about half a foot off the ground. Bedding, chamber pots, wooden boxes, books, food, and other items were scattered around, but some were arranged neatly.</p>
<p>Foreign Inmates Receive Better Treatment</p>
<p>Inmates eat two meals a day, with a ration of 18 liang of rice per day. The cell doors are opened once in the morning and once in the afternoon, allowing prisoners to walk or exercise in the corridor for an hour. The prison authorities aim to transform prisoners, selecting those with good conduct and adherence to prison rules to serve as cooks, cleaners, and perform other tasks. In the kitchen, winter melons and onions were piled up, ready to be cooked. Cylindrical machines were rotating in the laundry room. Many inmates were working in the carpentry, sewing, printing, typesetting, binding, leather shoe and sock making, and box making workshops. The finished products included boxes, tables, pottery, cheongsams, clothing, documents, forms, shoes, socks, and wooden boxes, all custom-made for external clients. The workshops were fully equipped. For example, the sewing workshop had more than 20 sewing machines, and the printing workshop had many large printing presses. The typesetting workshop had over 7,000 Chinese regular script lead characters. The working inmates appeared neat, resembling ordinary workers. In terms of education, the prison has a library, a counseling hall, and literacy classes. The education department is responsible for rotating and gathering inmates to provide transformation education. There are over 30 foreign prisoners in the foreign prison. Their cells are larger, their beds are canvas, and they eat bread. They receive better treatment than the Chinese prisoners but still express dissatisfaction with the food. The women's prison was not visited yesterday due to time constraints.</p>
<p>Appeal for Assistance in Adding Doorways</p>
<p>After guiding the visitors through the prison, Warden Kong discussed one matter with the councilors. The prison currently only has five doorways for family visits. Only five people can visit their families at the same time. However, there are over 5,000 inmates. Each inmate is allowed two family visits per month, meaning an average of 300 inmates need to use these five doorways each day. Due to the large number of people, the conversation time for each visit has to be shortened, causing great pain to both the inmates and their families. The prison originally planned to expand to twelve doorways, but the funding was not approved by higher authorities, preventing the plan from being realized. He hoped that enthusiastic members of society could assist in solving the problem.</p>

<h3>Water Transportation Resumes; Hangli Escapes Danger and Returns; Passengers Experienced Scare on Chongming Island While Sheltering from the Storm</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] After the typhoon passed, the weather cleared yesterday, and water transportation resumed. The Jiangya steamer sailed to Ningbo at 4:30 pm yesterday. The Jiangjing steamer has sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai and is expected to arrive as usual today. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang freighter is also expected to arrive today. The American-owned Hales, carrying 15,000 tons of diesel from Mexico, encountered severe wind and rain on the day before yesterday and sailed to Tongsha. Because the pilot could not board the ship in time, the captain assumed the role of harbor pilot. The ship ran aground after sailing less than a mile. Fortunately, it escaped danger when the tide rose. After the pilot boarded the ship yesterday morning, it arrived safely in Shanghai and is currently unloading at the petroleum company's wharf. The Yixiang Company's Fuyu freighter was blown to the Puxi shore by the hurricane on the day before yesterday and ran aground. It was towed out of danger yesterday morning and is still berthed at buoys 11 and 12, loading cargo for Guangzhou. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ruixin freighter, berthed at buoys 35 and 36, also ran aground due to the wind on the day before yesterday. It was towed out yesterday afternoon and is still berthed at the original buoy. Many other American freighters that ran aground or broke their cables due to the wind on the day before yesterday have all returned to normal. The Zhonghang Company's Hangli freighter, returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, carrying over 300 passengers, encountered the typhoon and was blocked from proceeding at the Shizilin section of the Yangtze River near Baoshan. The situation was critical. At noon, an urgent telegram for help was sent. After receiving the telegram, the company tried to find a solution, dispatching ships to rescue the freighter, but was unable to do so due to the severe wind and rain. Fortunately, the captain of the freighter was alert and slowly sailed to Chongming Island across the river to take shelter in Baozhen. The passengers were brought ashore. According to company sources yesterday, the passengers and crew are safe and sound and will return to Shanghai on the original ship this morning. The Datong-Dada Joint Venture's Jiangkang freighter, which sheltered from the wind in Hong Kong the day before yesterday, did not depart. It set sail last night and will arrive in Shanghai this morning, and will sail to Nantong that evening.</p>
<p>Seven Barge Accidents on the River</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The typhoon wreaked havoc in Shanghai, causing heavy losses on land and sea. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the families affected in the Huangpu River have reported a total of seven incidents to the Water Police Bureau yesterday: (1) Chen Renfu entrusted Zhou Fuji Transportation Company's barge No. 88689 to transport 450 bags of Xianqing thread to the No. 7 wharf of the China Merchants Bureau to be loaded onto the Deng steamer. Unexpectedly, it capsized due to the wind, and the goods were lost. (2) The Minyi Property Insurance Company, on behalf of Dacheng Textile Company, lost 250 pieces of raw cotton cloth and 250 pieces of Butterfly brand fine cloth, totaling 10,000 bolts, when the barge carrying the goods sank in the wind, resulting in a loss of 300 billion yuan. (3) Nanrongji Customs Brokerage transported 60 pieces of various cotton yarns and 79 pieces of cloth, loaded on the Yan barge for unloading onto the Fuyu freighter. Unfortunately, it also encountered an accident. (4) Nanrongji's barges Nos. 12345 and 12024, carrying 500 bags of bran, sank at the No. 7 wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. (5) China Travel Service transported over 100 pieces of cotton yarn on behalf of Anda Textile Factory, loaded on barges Nos. 22465 and 12099. All of them were lost. (6) Daxinlong Customs Brokerage's barge No. 31879, carrying 70 pieces of cotton yarn and 7 boxes of Dragon Head fine cloth, also encountered an accident. (7) Taikoo Chang Gongji Customs Brokerage lost 8 pieces of bleached cloth, totaling 200 bags, loaded on a barge at the Pudong Huazhan wharf.</p>
<p>Various Types of Goods Recovered</p>
<p>Zhang, Chief of the Water Police Bureau, ordered a large number of officers to take boats and salvage goods from the Huangpu River. It is reported that the following items have been recovered: 11 pieces of various cotton yarns, 23 bundles of scattered cotton yarns, 6 pieces and 5 bolts of white cloth, 7 boxes of soap, 20 pieces of books, and 49 bags of flour. Employees of Ewo Mill also recovered 8 pieces of cotton yarn, 1 box of soap, and 2 boxes of textbooks, and have notified the Water Police Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Western Film Negotiations to Reopen; Cinemas Dissatisfied with Low-Price Policy; Collaboration with Domestic Film Merchants Unlikely</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The triple dispute among the city's cinema operators, Western film merchants, and domestic film merchants, caused by the suspension of new film supply, has become increasingly deadlocked since the unsuccessful negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau a few days ago. The Social Affairs Bureau originally convened the three parties to mediate and restore the normal film supply relationship as soon as possible. However, due to mutual accusations and inability to reach a consensus, the meeting ended on an unpleasant note. Luo Xuelian, a representative of the domestic film merchants, believes that the film industry is a powerful tool for educating the public and therefore emphasized that ticket prices should be as affordable as possible. The cinema operators argued that the current low ticket prices of second, third, and fourth-run cinemas are already promoting accessibility. However, first-run theaters are affected by actual expenses, so ticket prices at all levels cannot but be slightly higher. They ultimately proposed two reasons to request that the price limit for certain seats be adjusted to 250,000 yuan: (1) The price limit for first-run theaters is too low, almost the same as the selling price of second, third, and fourth-run cinemas, which threatens their survival and may cause further complications. (2) The difference between the price limit and the self-determined ticket price is too large, and the number of seats is limited, so the black market will inevitably flourish, and the audience will still be affected. However, this request was rejected by the Social Affairs Bureau. According to the Cinema Operators Association, they initially resolutely terminated their contract with the Western film merchants, hoping to cooperate with the domestic film merchants. However, the domestic film merchants only sought to seize superior cinemas to consolidate their own territory, disregarding the survival conditions of various cinemas. They expressed particular dissatisfaction with Luo Xuelian's personal opinion advocating a low-price policy, ignoring the interests of cinema operators. Therefore, the first-run cinemas are currently discussing abandoning their previous decision and formally reopening negotiations with Western film merchants. The only prerequisite for the negotiations is to raise the selling price. Except for the 30% of seats with a price limit that cannot be adjusted temporarily, they plan to adjust the prices of other tickets that the authorities allow to be freely increased to a minimum of 500,000 yuan and a maximum of 1 million yuan. If this approach is implemented within days, the problem of Western film supply can be smoothly resolved. However, the lines for purchasing limited-price film tickets will become even more crowded, and the "scalpers" who manipulate the limited-price tickets will become even more active.</p>

<h3>Bloody Shadow Over Kaifeng</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Ling Songshou</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Kaifeng from This Newspaper, 1st Day of the Month] On June 16th, the 3rd, 8th, and 13th columns of the communist Chen Yi's forces, in coordination with the 1st column of the Liu Bocheng forces, fired the first shot outside the southern dike of Kaifeng, after capturing Chenliu. A storm began to descend on this ancient city by the Yellow River.</p>
<p>The fighting began on the southeast and south sides of the dike. On the 16th, the attacking communist forces were only a small number of advance troops. On the 17th, the main force of the communists in the Chenliu-Tongxu area gradually moved north. The east and west train stations of Kaifeng—Xinglong and Xinghuaying—fell. More than 60,000 communists gradually pressed towards Kaifeng. Chairman Liu Mao'en and Commander Li Zhongxin of the 66th Division decided to concentrate their forces and voluntarily abandoned the dike and the airfield, deploying strong defensive lines at important strongholds on the southeast side of the city, such as the Postal Administration, the China Public School, and the Yuwangtai. At this time, the</p>
<p>Kaifeng Garrison</p>
<p>consisted of the three regiments of the 13th Brigade of the 66th Division and the units directly under the division and brigade, plus the 1st and 2nd Security Regiments and the 5th and 6th Security Regiments. On the afternoon of the 17th, two regiments of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division, reinforcements retreating from Kaocheng in the west, arrived in Kaifeng after being attacked by the communists along the way. Only one regiment arrived in Kaifeng, serving as a reserve for the garrison of the East Gate. The brigade headquarters and the other regiment were cut off outside the city by the communists and could not enter. With such a small garrison, the defensive deployment of Kaifeng was as follows: the 37th and 39th Regiments of the 13th Brigade guarded the north and east city walls, respectively. The 5th Security Regiment garrisoned the West Gate. The 1st Security Brigade (only one regiment) was stationed at Songmen. The 2nd Security Brigade and the 6th Security Regiment were stationed at the Postal Administration, a major stronghold in the South Gate, and the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade guarded the China Public School and Yuwangtai outside the Xiaonanmen (Small South Gate). At one o'clock in the morning on the 18th, the battle for Kaifeng officially began. The communists attacked the east and west gates and the South Gate in three directions. The angry fire of our defenders was unleashed with rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades. In the wind and sand on the edge of the ancient city, under the dim moonlight, the attacking communist soldiers fell one by one. At the East (i.e., Caomen), Southwest, and West Gates, the communist casualties were at least one battalion. Of course, the communists would not give up. After nightfall, they again attacked the Songmen position of our 1st Security Brigade with their main force, and harassed the northwest corner of Kaifeng with a part of their force, in order to contain the 39th Regiment of the East Gate garrison. The sound of artillery and machine guns echoed throughout the night. After one o'clock on the 19th, about one battalion of communists broke into Songmen but was quickly annihilated by our defenders. At around three o'clock, more than 500 communists, under the cover of intense artillery fire, again approached the southeast corner of the city wall within about 500 meters, attempting to break in, but were again annihilated by our intense fire.</p>
<p>From dark to dawn, from daybreak to dusk, the sound of gunfire never stopped. Our air force also</p>
<p>circled above Kaifeng</p>
<p>day and night, constantly coordinating with ground forces and destroying enemy positions behind the lines. However, these measures could not stop the communists' cannibalistic intentions. At 2:50 p.m. on the 19th, the communists finally broke through Xiaonanmen and advanced towards the city center. However, along every street and on every building, the National Army had long prepared strong street fighting fortifications. In order to defend Kaifeng, our small number of heroic defenders strengthened the pressure, forcing the communists to retreat to the southeast corner. As the battle evolved to this stage, God had already decided the fate of Kaifeng and its people. Because the communist forces concentrated their firepower on our city's southern positions, the Postal Administration building caught fire, and the 2nd Security Brigade and the 6th Security Regiment suffered heavy casualties. Therefore, they retreated into the city and continued to engage in fierce street fighting with the communists who had entered the city in every bunker.</p>
<p>The remaining communists, pressed into the southeast corner of the city, took advantage of the cover of artillery fire and again harassed the city center. At midnight, the West Gate was also broken through by the communists, and the defense of the provincial government began.</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Mao'en was directing the defense of Kaifeng. He had not slept for four days and nights (although he usually only slept four hours a day). When the communists' bullets began to be fired at the provincial government, his staff had long urged him to break out, but he refused. He said that for Kaifeng, he should hold on to the last moment.</p>
<p>As in the past few days, the sound of gunfire echoed day and night, but even more fiercely. By dawn on the 20th, the</p>
<p>provincial government stronghold</p>
<p>remained standing firm, but its surroundings had been littered with countless bodies sacrificed in its defense.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 20th, the communists began to fire sulfur bombs at the provincial government. The communists' flames spread to every building of the provincial government, and the provincial government became a sea of fire! At the same time, the communists sent raiding troops around to the north side of the provincial government, launching a sneak attack from Chairman Liu's office. In this narrow alley, attacks and counterattacks occurred more than 20 times in a few hours. Here, machine guns and rifles had lost their effectiveness. The only weapons that could be used were hand grenades. In order to seize this stronghold, the communists sacrificed the main force of two more battalions. After nightfall on the 20th, Chairman Liu Mao'en and several guards, as well as Captain Xie of the cadre training class of the 5th Army, and a certain company commander, entered the basement. He saw that the situation could not be salvaged and wanted to commit suicide several times, but he did not have a weapon with him. At the same time, he was monitored by the people around him. The situation became increasingly tense. The people around Chairman Liu repeatedly urged him to break out, but Chairman Liu refused to agree. When his third brother, Liu Zhenbi, gave him advice, he kicked Liu Zhenbi away in anger, contrary to his usual respectful attitude, and shouted, "What do you know?" At the worst at two o'clock on the 21st, the provincial government stronghold could no longer be held. Therefore, Captain Wei and several others, regardless of his willingness, picked him up and ran, passed through the alleys, climbed over the corpses, and exited the city from the southwest corner. Of course, the Liu family had struggled in Henan for two years to maintain a situation that was difficult to sustain. For the future of Henan, for the 30 million people of Henan, he could not die.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, the steel and concrete provincial government had been reduced to ashes. The remaining defenders, in a situation where they could no longer defend, were liquidated! At this time, the communists</p>
<p>broke through the North Gate</p>
<p>and launched a fierce attack on Longting, where Commander Li Zhongxin's command post was located. Our troops defending Henan University concentrated and solidified their defense at a certain stronghold on the north city wall (northwest of Longting).</p>
<p>Longting is tens of feet high, with water on its left and right fronts and an open area behind it, making it a good stronghold in terms of terrain. During the day, our air force constantly blocked the small road leading from the front of Longting to the city center with machine guns. At the same time, our troops behind Longting also combined machine guns with a bunker in the northwest corner of the city to form a network of fire, making it impossible for the communists to approach. However, this was only doing one's best and waiting for fate. The communists had invaded Kaifeng. Could they give up now that only one stronghold remained? In the evening, the communists fired a dense barrage of artillery at Longting and constantly launched human wave attacks. At around 11 o'clock, the remaining defenders on Longting were either wounded or dead, and their ammunition was exhausted. Longting fell without the need for a fierce attack by the communists. At the same time, Commander Li Zhongxin committed suicide in the bunker north of the city. The few remaining defenders fought hard until about 9 a.m. on the 22nd and were finally eliminated. Kaifeng, which had been in a fierce battle for seven days, thus fell into communist hands.</p>

<h3>Woodcarvings from Two Thousand Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xuanyi</p>
<p>Records of Antiquities Unearthed in Changsha (2)</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changsha from This Newspaper, 1st Day of the Month] Among the wooden artifacts unearthed in Changsha, the most valuable for research are the idols with protruding eyes and protruding tongues. These idols come from wooden coffers in large wooden outer coffin tombs. The wooden coffers are about the size of coffins. The idols all have wooden seats. In front of the idols were arranged one zither, several feather-cups, and several pieces of pottery and wooden figurines. These statues have horns on their heads. The horns are made of antlers or deer horns, some complete, some destroyed at the time of excavation. More than ten of these idols were unearthed (one in each tomb). The most complete ones have all flowed to the United States. Americans call them "bobcats," and Chinese call them "Fangxiang." However, Fangxiang is a servant who wears a ghost mask to drive away ghosts. These idols are objects of worship in tombs. Although their shapes are similar, they should not be confused. They should be studied in terms of their purpose. The indigenous people of Taiwan have horned idols, and Bali has tongue-protruding witch doctors. Studying these customs can reveal that ancient southern customs were the same as those of the Pacific Islands. Based on the fact that they were worshipped, they can be called a kind of totem, or the "Shezhu" of ancient Chinese books, the wooden memorial tablets of modern villagers. Other items include boxes for storing swords, boxes for storing holidays items, large tigers carrying bells and drums, wooden spears, wooden swords, and so on.</p>
<p>The wooden figurines</p>
<p>are three feet seven or eight inches long, both male and female. Some have movable hands and feet, and their muscles are fully exposed. It is truly a miracle that carvings from the late Zhou Dynasty could be discovered in the damp soil of the south. I have been studying sculpture for more than 20 years and have written a book on the history of sculpture. I believe that the earliest Chinese sculpture dates back to the Han Dynasty. Therefore, when I saw the Chu wooden carvings in Changsha, I was almost dumbfounded. In Chinese museums, the Yu tripod and the Tang basin are common sights, but even fine sculptures from the Six Dynasties are extremely rare. As for wooden carvings from the late Zhou Dynasty, they are unheard of.</p>
<p>Lacquerware</p>
<p>includes boxes for storing bronze mirrors and combs. The boxes are cylindrical, with lids, or divided into three tiers, with three small boxes in the lower tier. Silver or bronze bells were used on the rims of the lacquer boxes (called "Kouqi" in the Han Dynasty), with bronze feet attached below, and the middle was decorated with animal-face rings (the broken bronze bottom in the museum is this). The entire body is covered with thick lacquer, and figures, patterns, and animals are painted on the lacquer, or patterns are engraved with needles, as fine as silk threads, with infinite variations. There are occasional seal characters on the bottom, such as "25th Year," etc.</p>
<p>The use of lacquer seems to have been very common at that time. One of the idols mentioned above was not only lacquered but also painted with flowers all over its body. Although the scabbard was wooden, the black lacquer shone brightly and was as thick as cloth. The box for storing holiday items contained three rolls of lacquer skin, which were even thicker than leather. There were also large pottery</p>
<p>cauldrons and jars</p>
<p>whose exteriors were also coated with stone-like lacquer that shone brightly, with colorful light grass painted on them. The top of the coffin was also thickly lacquered, with patterns as complex as those of Dunhuang murals, but even the United States does not have this kind of painted coffin, let alone Chinese collectors. I still feel sad about the loss of the lid of this painted coffin.</p>
<p>In addition to the lacquer items mentioned above, the most numerous</p>
<p>lacquer plates</p>
<p>and lacquer feather-cups were the most numerous. At least 60 lacquer plates and 300 feather-cups were unearthed, but only about one-tenth of them were complete and could be preserved. This is because the lacquerware was in good condition when it was unearthed, but after half a year in the sealed protective boxes, it would crack and become unusable. If this were a planned excavation, with photos and rubbings taken immediately after excavation, the beauty of the Chu clan's patterns would be enough to amaze the world. Other items, such as lacquered tables and lacquered military clothing, are also very beautiful, but unfortunately, there are too few of them.</p>

<h3>Grain Prices Have Started to Fall as Speculators Fear Investigation of Warehouses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw tight credit, and customers wanted to sell. Furthermore, the inspection of warehouses has led to panic selling among speculators, resulting in a surge in supply. The market opened steadily but declined later in the day. High-quality white japonica rice and high-quality thin indica rice both fell to 21 million [currency units], a decrease of 1 million compared to the previous day. The market quotation remains at 20 million, but the quality has improved. Yesterday's arrivals at the North and South markets totaled 5,818 shi.</p>
<p>Flour prices are undetermined, pending a meeting of manufacturers this afternoon. Market trading remains suspended. Old Army and troopship flour prices outside the market are 6.65 million. The market is very firm due to high wheat and tin prices. Bran is 4.5 million, small bags are 3.5 million, and wheat factory bids reached 9 million.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Grains are generally rising because prices were not fully adjusted after trading resumed yesterday. Therefore, sellers are holding firm on higher prices. Soybean prices, combined with soybean cake and oil prices, are too low, so they rose by 1 million yesterday. Merchants from Hankou offered nearly 6,000 bags of Zhada soybeans at 10 million, which were mostly bought by oil factories. Corn rose by 200,000 to 300,000, broad beans rose by 100,000, and mung beans, sesame seeds, and raw kernels, which had not risen enough previously, increased more in price yesterday. Mung beans rose by 1 million to 2 million, sesame seeds rose by 2 million to 3 million, and raw kernels rose by 4 million to 5 million.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices are generally lower than the price ceiling because of tight credit and increased buying and selling. Dayou soybean oil opened at 44.45 million and closed at 43.8 million. Changde soybean oil was 42 million. Rapeseed oil was lower by 1 million, trading at 42 million. When the price of raw oil was set, pure raw oil was traded off the books.

<h3>Market Controls Loosen, Future of Chinese Stocks Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw a slight relaxation of controls in various markets outside of the industry. Interest from speculative funds began to diversify, and there was a trend of selling after prices rose. The limit-up of Qinxing and Jinglun, and the limit-down of Match and Xinhua, created a mixed picture, making the future uncertain. After consecutive gains, a peak followed by decline is feared.</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, people were wary after consecutive gains. The market opened with more declines than gains.

Qinxing and Jinglun announced limit-up, and Guang merchants 202 and 155, as well as major investors 152, 203, 145, 95, 230, and 122, and bank group 220 strongly sold off. The last commission fee was still at the original price, falling back to 6,820 yuan. The controls on yarn and cloth have been relaxed, inevitably leading to some diversification. 176, 95, 89, 85, and 116 were maintained, once recovering to 7,100 yuan, but ultimately, due to an influx of stock, 203, 184, 169, 164, 219, 180, and 89 came to settle again, and Match even reported limit-down. The noon closing fell to 6,850 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, Jinglun, Qinxing, Nei Yi, and Hengfeng rose by 5% to 10%, while Guohuo, Shangwu, Zhabei, Jingfu, Datong, Rongfeng, Match, and Zhongsi fell by 5% to 10%, and the rest saw mixed gains and losses.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yongsha first rose to 7,150 yuan, then fell back to 7,020 yuan. 206, 18, 179, 180, 106, 3, 8, 176, and 54 then advanced to a new record of 7,260 yuan. Jinglun and Qinxing rose to the limit, and Guang merchants 202 and major investors 117, 95, 61, and 131 settled, gradually moving downstream, falling to 6,950 yuan. Match and Xinhua reacted by hitting limit-down. Guohang saw little progress and entered a sideways trend, closing at 7,000 yuan. Compared to the latest closing, Jinglun and Datong hit limit-up, Xinhua and Match hit limit-down, Shangwu, Qinxing, and Guohuo were flat, Yonggong and Zhabei rose by 5%, Huaxin fell by 5%, and the rest saw minor changes. In the off-market trading of unlisted stocks, Dasheng and Shijie rose by 10%, becoming profitable, while the rest were flat.</p>

<h3>Seventh Season Import Quotas to Be Significantly Reduced</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] It is learned that the quantities of the seventh season import quotas will be greatly reduced.

In the future, the foreign exchange required for imports will be paid entirely from foreign exchange earned from exports. Therefore, the quantities of other items in the seventh season import quota, even those that do not overlap with US aid materials, will also be reduced.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Footing Solid</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw more buyers inquire due to the improved weather.

<h3>Liangjiang Swimming Pool: Reissuing Long-Term Passes</h3>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College swimming pool on Weidemei Road has been open since the first of this month. Due to the clean water and proper management, many people have been going to swim there in recent days. In addition to soon holding elementary training classes so that beginner swimmers can experience the fun of swimming, the pool is also actively making improvements to achieve perfection. The pool held a swimming competition last summer, at which time it was stipulated that, in addition to prizes, the top scorers in the women's group would also receive a long-term pass for the following year. Apart from Miss Liu Tianjuan, who has already claimed hers, there are still eight people – Huang Yunbo, Zhang Xingyan, Ma Shu, Bai Xianming, Hong Bi, Long Huixia, Ye Jingxiong, and Wang Weili – whose mailing addresses are unknown. It is hoped that after seeing this announcement in the newspaper, they will provide their mailing address and two 2.5-inch photos to the pool management office so that the long-term pool passes can be issued.</p>

<h3>Regarding Free Tuberculosis X-Ray Checkups: Our Contribution of Opinions to Reporters</h3>
<p>If there is any suspicion about chest health, an application for a checkup should be submitted immediately.</p>
<p>In order to raise the awareness of tuberculosis among the people of our country, our newspaper began to organize free tuberculosis X-ray checkups starting last summer. Our original intention was not to completely eradicate tuberculosis, this invisible killer, because "checkups" themselves are a passive thing. However, we wanted to make sure that the health conditions of the lungs of every reader who applied for a checkup were fully revealed, so that they could receive preventive and treatment opportunities in a timely manner. Last year's tuberculosis checkup started in early May and ended at the end of July, with eleven cooperating hospitals. This year, in order to promote this movement more widely, the cooperating hospitals, in addition to the eleven hospitals that participated last year, have added the Municipal Third Hospital, Zhongxi Recuperation, China Recuperation, and Heping Civilian Hospital, for a total of fifteen hospitals. This makes our service area almost cover the entire city of Shanghai.</p>
<p>From June 21st to today, the number of readers who have applied for checkups has reached more than two thousand. Among them, except for those with incomplete procedures who are temporarily not being processed, all have been issued free checkup coupons and assigned to hospitals near the applicants for their checkups. Counting from today, there are still a full fifteen days left until the end of the one-month deadline. There are still more than one thousand places available for checkups. We hope that our readers will actively apply to participate. This time, fifteen hospitals, including Zhongshan, are cooperating with us and sacrificing their valuable medical time to serve readers with enthusiasm, which deserves our gratitude and praise.</p>
<p>According to current prices, the cost of an X-ray checkup ranges from one million to two million yuan. Assuming that the number of checkups is three thousand, the consultation fees sacrificed by the fifteen hospitals are a huge sum of forty to fifty billion yuan. Dear readers, in tomorrow's column, you will see our published "Fifth Application Form." If you suspect that your lungs are unhealthy, please follow the application procedures. In the past, many applicants did not include a self-addressed stamped envelope or did not include return postage. Because of the regulations, it was impossible to process their applications. Now, please re-apply or complete the procedures so that we can mail the checkup coupons.</p>

<h3>On Tradition</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many people criticizing traditional Chinese thought. Most things are opposed, and it's no wonder. Everyone has unspeakable pain and always wants to find the root cause of the disease. This makes the ancients suffer. It's like a child falling down and blaming the door sill. It's inevitable to curse it, even spit on it a couple of times, and stomp on it. After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, there was such a period. Mr. Wu Yu, who single-handedly attacked the Confucian shop, and Lin Yutang, who greatly ridiculed Confucius with "Zi Jian Nanzi," both had their moment in the spotlight, but Confucius is still Confucius. Saying that he has too much social influence is certainly true, but old things are not entirely garbage, and they are still useful in some ways. It is right that they should not be completely erased.</p>
<p>Originally, discussing the ancients is very difficult. Zhuangzi's saying, "You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of fish?" is a famous saying that cannot be discounted. In reasoning about ancient society and thought, no matter what, we cannot avoid today's subjective filtering effect, that is, the benevolent and the wise each see differently. Confucius and Mencius in those days were not "three heads and six arms" (as Tang Yongtong said), and they were desperately trying their luck. – Because of this, some people say that Confucianism is desperate to be officials, obsessed with officialdom, which is indeed true; but Mozi's advocacy everywhere, and his disciples also holding office in various countries, and the enthusiasm of Legalists and strategists, is even more intense than that of Confucianism. How can we say that? We cannot think that Confucius was born an idol. Idols are created by those who use him, deliberately making him look like this. What does that have to do with Confucius? If we say that Confucius' disciples specialized in flattering officials, then in the time of Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, there were Zha Liang and Ning Yuan, who preferred to study etiquette in the Confucian forest rather than follow Shusun Tong to be a jester; there were many flattering officials and sycophants in various dynasties, but there were also many remonstrating officials and outspoken scholars. Qian Muzhai went to welcome the new master outside Yifengmen, while Shi Kefa died for the country in Yangzhou, and Huang Lizhou and Zhang Cangshui, how did they not talk about Neo-Confucianism? Even Wang Yangming and Gu Yanwu deeply hated it, thinking it was the main reason for the fall of the country. In fact, Yaojiang was both a literary and political figure, capable in both war and peace. How could he be compared to those who idly stood by and died in times of crisis? If we want to draw conclusions from these sporadic phenomena, unless we adopt American-style statistical methods, use scientific comparison, and decide on the majority percentage, we need to analyze all twenty-five histories. However, this raises another question, which is the standard of good and evil. Human mental activity is the most difficult thing to regulate, so the so-called moral concepts cannot be accurate for all seas and passed down for a hundred generations. For example, in history, there have been many views on Zhang Xianzhong, Li Zicheng, Huang Chao, and Hong Xiuquan in the past fifty years, and with them come the merits and demerits of Zeng Guofan, Hu Linyi, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang; so, even if we want to study a family or a social group as meticulously as the Americans, it is still difficult to do so! Moreover, Chinese people especially like to write "Wu Zixu was not a filial son" and "Yue Fei was not a loyal minister" types of revisionist articles.</p>
<p>Confucius also told his disciples: "Be a Confucian gentleman, do not be a petty Confucian," and "The virtuous recognize the great, the unworthy recognize the small." This means that even if the Tao is one foot high, the devil can be ten feet high. In the mouth of a petty Confucian disciple, Confucius is inevitably trivial and unbearable. Just look at how much Mencius quoted Confucius' words, taking only what he needed. Mencius was certainly not a petty Confucian, but the fact that various doctrines can be interpreted at will is very clear. If we say that Chinese tradition contains Confucius' thought, it is certainly true, but if we say that it is purely Confucius' thought, and put all the blame on Confucius, and even trace back his private life and actions, none of which are sufficient to influence future generations in a confusing way, then I cannot but speak up for Confucius. An orange tree planted south of the Huai River becomes a pomelo, and planted north of the Huai River becomes a trifoliate orange, which is a very clear metaphor. Confucianism has undergone countless transformations, mixtures, and distortions to this day; Dong Zhongshu wanted to dismiss the hundred schools of thought, which inherited Mencius' tradition of resisting heretical words and spreading evil theories, and met the political needs of the great unification of the Han Dynasty. Is this Confucius' doing? In the Analects, there are very few instances of scolding people so harshly. The reason why Mencius did so was probably due to political struggle; as for the empty and superficial Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties, that was a trick of Indian philosophy. Confucius never talked about things like mind, nature, principle, or subtle and profound things! To be honest, the thought at that time was not advanced enough to be so systematic and organized, so the book of the Analects is full of trivialities and the commonness of daily life, just as Confucius himself said: "If you cannot serve people, how can you serve ghosts?" The source of the scholar-official class is not entirely due to Confucius alone. There is no giant in the world who can create a class by himself; the main thing is the progress of production, and humans have the leisure to seek knowledge and develop their intellect, so there are more and more people who do not make a living by production. Confucius was certainly one, but what about Mozi, Han Fei, Zhuang Zhou, Lao Tzu, Guan Zhong, Shang Yang, and Gongsun Yang? Class concepts and characteristics become deeper and deeper, and eventually become clearly opposed; coupled with external troubles, wars, natural disasters, and other factors, everyone falls into poverty, and thus gradually uses class power to fight for interests and benefits, and become greedy for their own gain. The more this happens, the more uneasy people become, and this trend cannot be curbed. The worsening of this trend further contributes to social unrest, a cyclical effect that is truly terrifying. Perhaps these things were not foreseen by Confucius two thousand years ago?</p>
<h3>Giving Gifts</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>A year ago, holding a wedding reception with refreshments would generally not result in a loss. The income and expenses of the day would not only offset each other, but there would also be a surplus; but now it is not the case.</p>
<p>The reason is extremely simple: A year ago, the "price" of gifts was generally between 40,000 and 100,000 yuan; at 40,000 yuan, you could buy two packs of American cigarettes. As long as two guests gave 40,000 yuan, you could supply all the guests with cigarettes; but what about now? Gifts of 1 million are more common. You can't even buy two packs of San Paotai.</p>
<p>Of course, the gift-givers know that a sum of 1 million is very meager, but if you say 2 million, then for the average salaried person, if there are three social obligations in a month, that would be 6 million, which is inevitably felt to be beyond their means; let's give a discount and give 1.5 million, but this amount seems too incomplete.</p>
<p>If we take 100,000 yuan a year ago as the standard, at that time you could buy one dan of white rice; then those who used to give 100,000 yuan should now give at least 20 million (today the retail price of rice has reached 23.4 million), but in fact, it is rare to see gifts of 10 million at wedding receptions today, except for a few wealthy families.</p>
<p>Therefore, recently, every time I have to give a wedding gift, it always makes me hesitate for a long time, consider again and again. As a result, I have the will but not the strength. After sealing a red envelope, I shamefully write my name, and then shamefully run to the wedding reception, hurriedly drop it off at the accounting office, sign my name at the registration place, and then sneak away. I feel that giving such a small gift is too stingy, and I am really embarrassed to consume another serving of Western pastries. Xian Si.</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>Since its inception, the United Nations Children's Welfare Fund has achieved fairly good results. The most enthusiastic country is Iceland. Their population is only 127,000, but they have donated $400,000, an average of $3 per person.</p>
<p>Each time the United Nations General Assembly meets, it needs the following: (1) a venue covering 110,850 square feet; (2) 600 offices for 2,600 representatives (representing 57 member states); (3) 1,000 typewriters; (4) 1,000 telephones; (5) 400 filing cabinets; (6) 2,800 first-class hotel rooms.</p>
<p>According to estimates by the New York Herald Tribune, more than 30,000 new "words" were added during World War II, but some of them have been gradually eliminated after the war. American scholars are studying which new words should be included in the dictionary.</p>
<h3>The Death of Mozart</h3>
<p>— Huan Ren</p>
<p>The great musician Mozart, known as the "musical prodigy," lived in poverty all his life. Although he did not have to feign death to avoid debts like Maupassant, he did not even have money to buy charcoal in the winter. He had to put his hands in his socks and huddle in his dilapidated house to avoid the cold.</p>
<p>This generation of musicians died of lung disease caused by hunger, cold, and malnutrition. Mozart was short-lived, dying at the age of only thirty-six. His funeral expenses totaled only ten yuan and three cents. Although there were initially six people at the funeral, a heavy rain halfway through washed away all six mourners, so Mozart was still lonely in the end.</p>
<p>However, some people say that Mozart did not die of lung disease, but on the battlefield.</p>
<p>It is said that after saying goodbye to his lover, Gedoria, Mozart went to the battlefield and led the soldiers who raised him to charge in the wilderness and in the valleys. But once, he got lost in a valley and was captured by the enemy troops. They whipped him, kicked him, and forced him to reveal military secrets, but he just closed his eyes and did not answer. Therefore, he pitifully left this world under whipping and kicking.</p>
<p>It is said that he groaned like this a few times before he died:</p>
<p>"Saint, Gedoria..."</p>
<h3>Strange Footprints</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>This strange incident occurred in Devonshire, England, and even the most intelligent scientists and biologists have no satisfactory explanation for it. People in western Devonshire say that the devil himself once walked through the countryside eighty years ago!</p>
<p>It was a snowy night in the dead of winter. The next morning, strange hoof-shaped footprints, nearly one hundred miles long, were imprinted on the snow, walking along the banks of the River Axe, not only through the countryside but also over houses, walls, and sods. Some people opened their doors and found footprints had stopped at their doorsteps. What was even more surprising was that all the footprints formed a straight line.</p>
<p>As soon as the news spread, everyone rushed out to see what was going on. The cold winter morning was bitterly cold, so the snow had not melted yet, but the strange footprints quickly disappeared. Later, it was discovered that these strange footprints had crossed the two-mile-wide estuary of the River Axe.</p>
<p>Newspapers publicized and discussed it. The entire countryside was plunged into panic. Everyone locked their doors and hid at home, and dared not step out of their doors after dark.</p>
<p>Next, theorists offered explanations; kangaroos, moles, foxes, frogs, otters, geese, and hares were all speculated to be the owners of the strange footprints. However, the truth remained unclear – because from the footprints, the night walker was a one-legged creature. Another explanation was that because Devonshire was very close to the sea and the river, it was possible that some deep-sea creature had accidentally come ashore for a stroll.</p>
<p>However, whether it is a wild beast, an aquatic creature, or a flying bird, it is impossible for a one-legged creature to travel a hundred miles in a straight line on a short snowy night, and also be able to climb walls and walk on roofs.</p>
<p>So, where did the footprints come from? Who left them? People often attribute inexplicable mysteries to ghosts and monsters, so the people of Devonshire say that the devil walked through their land.</p>
<h3>The Coldest Cinema</h3>
<p>— Liu An</p>
<p>In this kind of hot summer weather, if a cinema does not have air-conditioning equipment, its seats are bound to be discounted. Just imagine hundreds of people squeezed into a tightly closed room, wouldn't they be "overheated"?</p>
<p>However, in a place called Ivalo, a perpetually cold cinema has recently opened, completely without the need for air-conditioning equipment—the reason being that Ivalo is 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle. That cinema can probably be considered the northernmost cinema in the world. So far, the film that audiences in Ivalo like to watch the most is "Tarzan Finds a Son," which is set in the tropical jungle.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The two municipal councils of Beiping and Shanghai opened simultaneously, and the mayors of the two cities attended on the same day (the 22nd) to report on government affairs and answer questions. The questions and answers between the councilors and the mayors were each subtly worded, and could be described as different approaches to the same goal.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, Councilor Fan criticized Mayor Wu for being "slick" in his conduct. The Mayor explained that he "has never belonged to any faction, and therefore does not consider any faction when handling affairs, which may be the origin of the term 'slick'." Such a statement is not only not "slick," but also extremely "upright." It is an argument without an argument, shifting the subject and seamlessly connecting. This demonstrates the ingenuity of the phrasing, which the Chinese call "answering fluently" and the West calls "smart reply." Zhuge Liang's "debating the Confucian scholars" during the Three Kingdoms period and Napoleon's "verbally defending against the German generals" both exemplify such talent.</p>
<p>"Slick" is not a negative term. It is even more commonly used in modern current affairs translations and commentaries. When things are going smoothly (even better than the word "smoothly"), it is often said to be "progressing smoothly," which is not far from success. Its opposite terms are "friction" and "discord," indicating a bleak future. At the beginning of the victory, if the Five-Power Conference in London had proceeded "smoothly" and concluded satisfactorily, then the problems of Europe and Asia would have been resolved long ago. How could there have been nearly three years of "making a mess of things"? How valuable "smoothness" is! The above refers to the handling of affairs. As for "conducting oneself," then "smoothness" is certainly not a good principle, but is "uprightness" "a difficult path to walk?" It is also difficult to express in a single word. It seems necessary to put oneself in each other's shoes and study it especially. Moreover, the council mainly focuses on deliberation, while self-cultivation and conduct in the world are personal matters, and it is more appropriate to choose a quiet place for lectures to discuss morality. Regarding the Beiping councilors' attitude toward the Beiping mayor, they attached "people" to "things," which is not empty but "substantive," and does not suffer from the disease of "irrelevant writing." Comparing the two, the gains and losses are clear.</p>

<h3>Near Poems of Xia'an</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>Feeling and Writing Upon Hearing of the Burial of Elder Sanyuan in West Lake, Hangzhou</p>
<p>The war-laden sky weighs heavily on this lake, his floating home had already drawn near Old Su. (West Lake Scholar Road is named after Su Dongpo, and the Elder rented a residence there for more than a year, where I often visited him.) He readily casts off the world's net, his spirit not yet extinguished, (When the Elder was in Baixia, he and Layman Yang Renshan opened the Jetavana Vihara, and many followed him.) Only in the poetry world, what ambition did he plan! (The Poetry World Commanders List of the Guangxu and Xuantong periods ranked the Elder as Timely Rain, but I know that was not his ambition.) His spirit of lament should dream in the Chu marshes, (The Elder grew up in Hunan. Mr. Youming governed Hunan, and many new policies were assisted by his attending court, but few know of this now.) His departing soul perhaps lingers in the Jinglu. (After the Reform Movement of 1898, the Elder served his parents and returned to Jiangxi, building a house on the Green Mountain of the Western Mountains, named Jinglu, and I have seen many poems about it, but it is now desolate.) My youth has turned white, to whom shall I look up? Turning my head and reciting the verses, a hundred sighs. (After the Reform Movement of 1898, the Elder lived in Nanchang. Because of Shi Zeng, I was able to visit the Elder, who said in the preface to my poems, "A young man often comes to my house and plays with my children." Now this young man is almost seventy, and both the Elder and Shi have passed away. The Elder greatly praised my editing and publishing of the posthumous collections of old friends, and gave me a poem saying, "Relatives and old friends entrust me with many posthumous books," which refers to this.)</p>
