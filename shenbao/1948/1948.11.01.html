<h3>共匪如控制東北九省　世界戰禍從此開始　總統對美記者解答三問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平卅一日電〕紐約前鋒論壇報記者史迪錄（A.steele），於廿九日在北平晋謁蔣總統，提出有關時局之問題，精求總統賜予解答。總統就三個問題表示意見：</p>
<p>（一）對於「國軍目前暫時失利其基本原因如何」之問題，總統答覆如下：</p>
<p>政府歷來軍事之方針，無論抗戰剿匪，皆以保持國家領土主權，及保議人民生命財產爲惟一目的，故一城一地均不輕於放棄。中國抗戰八年，以收復東北爲職志，抗戰結束以後，國軍冒險犯難，接收東北，其重要地區，尤不能輕於棄守。而中國軍隊之傳統思想，與責任觀念，皆以與土地共存亡爲軍人唯一之職務，而以離城棄守，爲軍人之恥辱。因此，三年以來，國軍處處設防，備多力分，形成處處薄弱之虞。共匪乘此弱點，乃以「以大吃小」之戰法，集中其全力攻我薄弱之一點，於是屢被其各個擊破，此所以逐漸造成今日嚴重之局勢。</p>
<p>政府人民之政府，兵員之徵集，糧秣之籌劃，均須顧及人民之利益，恪守國家之法令。而共匪則對人民，毫無所愛惜，分區濫發僞幣，隨時沒收人民之財產，徵發壯丁，搜括糧食，極盡其殘忍之手段。最近一年來，共匪更假借「土地改革」之名，作竭澤而漁之榨取，故匪軍力量，一時有大量之擴張，而匪軍撤退時之焦土政策，進攻時之「人海戰術」，更非國軍所願爲。因此，國軍在集中力量，作主力戰鬥之時，必操勝算。在一時一地，則往往降於劣勢遭受挫折，此之爲國軍暫失利之基本原因，故今日政府剿匪戰略術，勢不能不有所改變，軍事政治敎育亦應有澈底之改革。吾人必須統籌全局，以爭取最後成功，不復爭一時一地之得失。</p>
<p>余更須指出，今日與政府作戰之共匪，爲倚恃共產國際支持之中日韓共黨聯合之軍事行動，吾人應特別警覺其嚴重性。中國本爲積弱之國家，然吾人從不畏强權與暴力，吾人對日本軍閥之侵略，已與之作八年之抗戰，而對於擁有武裝暴力之共匪，且已作廿五年之鬥爭，自民國十三年以來，國民革命軍，在北伐剿匪，及抗戰每一長期戰役中，曾經過多次挫折，遭受重大之失敗，而最後卒皆獲光榮之勝利。吾人在此廿五年間，屢遭比今日更爲嚴重之局勢，而無一次不終於克服。吾人基於痛苦之經驗，持有堅定之信心，只須以百折不迴之精神，作再接再厲之奮鬥，深信戡亂建國，亦卽在此失敗之後，達到最後成功之境域。所望我全國軍民，澈底警覺共匪之猖獗國家之危機，一致奮起，共赴國難，盡其救國自救之責任。吾人所恃者，爲民族精神與三民主義，決非任何陰謀暴行所能毀滅。吾人決不輕視今日匪勢之嚴重，但共匪對人民慘酷榨取所造成之每一攻勢，皆使其人力物力趨於枯竭，重蹈江西時代之覆轍，最後必將歸於消滅。倘如政府更能早得友邦道義及物資的援助，受國際正義之支持，最後成功，必能獲致，可以斷言。</p>
<p>（二）對於史氏所提「政府是否以全方保持潘陽」之問題，總統答覆如下：</p>
<p>政府保持東北領土，及國家在東北之主權，自九一八以來，始終一貫，具有決心，此次若謂東北整個局勢，自錦州長春陷落以後東北軍事已趨於失敗，潘陽之得失，已不如過去之重要，而國軍在潘陽不惜犧牲一切，與共匪作最後之鬥爭，乃爲我政府對人民對世界盡其最大之實任。東北問題為國際問題最重大者之一，其對國際形勢實有重大之影響，尤以與太平洋有密切關係之各國爲然，而三年以來，此一艱巨之共同責任，皆由我中國單獨担負，兩中國經三年艱苦之奮鬥，至今　已盡其最大之努力，而猶不能達成其任務，至爲遺憾。遠在十七年之前，九一八事變發生，余曾對世界各友邦，及國際聯盟，發出警吿，認爲世界戰禍，從此開始。當時此一警吿，固不爲各國所重視、但歷史事實，證明東北問題，爲第二次世界大戰之序幕。今日歷史，正在重演，倘如國際正義不能伸張，民主國家仍持隔岸觀火，不關痛癢之態度，必將重蹈過去之覆轍。萬一不幸共匪控制中國，另一世界大戰，固必發生，卽共匪控制凍北之九省，世界戰禍，亦將從此開始。其尤爲顯明者，無完整之東北，卽無獨立之韓國，亦無和平之東亞。余敢斷言，太平洋險惡風雲，又將以東北爲起點。（下轉第二版）</p>
<h3>瀋陽呈死寂關態　軍政首長均已搭機飛出人民不安心情異於尋常</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽卅一日電〕衛立煌·趙家驪·王鐵漢·董文琦等最高軍政首長，均於三十日由東陵機塲飛離潘陽，至二三流軍政人員，均未得離去。又周福成·潘裕昆·龍天武軍長等，聞均在潘收容部隊中。聞雙方自昨午後開始談商，潘陽代表人物未詳，徵聞以不使百姓慘遭塗炭爲主旨。軍方自三十一日資遺辦公人員，現除偶聞一二陣稀疏槍砲聲外，卽爲人民不安之心情異於尋常耳</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽卅一日電〕潘陽轉入異樣死寂狀態，三十日午後卽不聞密集之槍砲聲，夜間除軍車忙亂外，竟無若何鑿息·三十一日晨迄午，街頭一切如常，惟車馬較稀，軍民遷移者衆·潘陽警憲及市府警備隊，均在照常維持治安中。人民頗感於物價三十日慘跌，三十一日暴漲，晴朗天空已無飛機聲，人多改抱聽天由命態度。</p>

<h3>美軍事援華物資將提前運至我國　華府高級官員對我局勢極關懷</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓卅日合衆電〕消息靈通人士頃稱：美國軍事援華首批物資，原定於十二月啓程，刻已提前至十一月，其第二批可能提早至十二月初，但彼等稱：此事尙非最後決定，因西海岸海員罷工可能阻碍物資之運輸工作，彼等稱：此項物資將在上海卸貨。</p>

<h3>讀財經改革補充方案有感</h3>
<p>財經改革補充新措施，已於昨日之臨時政務會中通過，其要點如下：（一）糧食恢復自由買賣；（二）六大都市之糧食配售，繼績辦理；（三）紗布油糖煤鹽，由中央核本定價，統籌調節，其他日用品及工業原料，則由地方核本定價，加以管理，（四）不許各地方禁止貨物流通；（五）公用交通事業，決定加價；（六）公敎人員的待遇及工資均准予調整；（七）貨物稅及其他從價徵收之稅捐，亦均照物價予以調整。扼要言之：一爲公敎人員待遇准予調整，二爲加稅及公用及交通事業將加價，一三爲限價卽廢止。</p>
<p>以上這三項決議，其中第一項，卽公敎人員的待遇問題，在八。一九財經緊急處分令頒行之初，本報社論卽代爲呼籲，各方面並已紛紛指出，認爲揆諸情理，不能持久。因爲照底薪以四士元作基數，其折扣未免過於太高，而按諸金圓劵兌換銀元的比率，無形中又打了一個對折，何况七十日來，黑市熾烈，限價早間餼羊，此次連同工資，決定准予合理提高，這毋寗說是事實上必然的結果。</p>
<p>第二項國營公用交通事業的加價一節，迭據有關當局宣佈，早經決定勢在必行。此次縱沒有這項補充方案的擬訂，恐怕也未必能獲倖免。至於提高稅額，一部份早已實施，現又重言申明，自必將積極進行，以期彌補國庫收支之赤字。但我們總希望此刻所加的程度，不要太議太高，以免過分刺激物價，影響金圓券的幣値。</p>
<p>最爲大衆所關切的，當然是第三項的限價問題了。除糧食及其他商品准許自由買賣外，凡紗，布，油，糖，煤，鹽等日用品及重要工業原料，均實行核本定價，這就是一面廢除限價，間時採用議價。在目前的情形看來，這自然不能不說是對症發棄的救急良方了。試思柴米蔬菜等人生日常必須之品，樣樣必須排隊擠購，而且還擠購不到，這種危象，如果閉了眼睛，再讓它自然發展下去，前途何堪設想？不過還有一點，使我們不敢大意的，卽如何實行核本定價這件事。因爲「核本定價」四個大字，說說容易，做做也未必容易，如何恰到好處，如何全面配合，其麻煩艱難，正與以往七十天之限價相似。而且須提醒大家的，限價則物資日少，議價則物價日高，那時大家切莫再來怨天尤人。</p>
<p>望文生義，所謂核太定價，應卽是議價的異名。而按照過去情形，議價的結果，大致不外乎二途：一則官廳不甚過問，任憑商人自議自漲，事實上等於放任；一則過於緊刻，不顧成本如何，硬要商人蝕本，而且多所顧忌，不能按時調整，致造成了黑市，走私，與物資缺乏的現象。所以「核本定價」的目的，如果確在取締暴利，以維持正當的工商業，則如何實施的技術上的問題，似乎値得硏究。我們以爲：不論其在中央抑爲地方，應先讓各該業公正人士自行擬議，附具理由，報候核定，而在實行核定時，必須眞正根據成本，公開評定，除有關方面得派負陳述意見外，最好由民意機關會同辦理，以昭平允。其核議價格之時間性，尤不宜過於板滯，應漲應跌，均應依據市塲供求之實際情形，隨時調整，以免徒成具文，釀成黑市。</p>
<p>原案對於中央所主管的紗布油糖煤鹽等項，除核本定價外，尙有統籌調節這一額，又地方主管的日用品及工業原料，亦並授以管理的槽柄。這在調劑供求，疏導來源諸方面設想起來，當然亦是合情合理的事。而且在軍事期間，交通每多阻滯，外匯有限，原料常虞不繼，倘能由主管官歷來帮回調撥，設法協助，這豈不是好事？不過總希望這些調節與管理機構，認淸目標，不要遇事推諉，或敷衍時日，尤其不可別具副作用，致形成了變相的稅收機關，方不負中央維持生產，改善經濟的美意。若照過去的情形看來，總覺得箝制。束縛。剝削。攘奪的意味太多，而扶助。獎掖。促進。維持的實效太少，除事實上的必要外，似乎不如照限價一樣，乾脆地不管爲妥。例如：國棉聯購一事，在紡織業看來，似乎也不能不說是「統籌關節」之道，但試問實行以來，究有什麽成績？搶購了多少棉花？假使當時鼓勵紗厰棉商，分別搶購，恐其成績當遠勝於目前。政府有許多事，從前不知道走了幾回錯路，可是總不相信，硬顧面子，執抝到底，弄到後悔嫌遲，深願今後不可再蹈覆轍。</p>
<p>最後，附帶一說者，今天行政院的補充辦法，原是八一九緊急措施令中第四項辦法第十四條所規定的，當局早應在明令公布後一週或十天以內就負責幹好，其時各貨黑市尙未發生，人民對金圓劵信心方盛，着爲處理，決不致使市塲有過去半個月來的騷動，升斗小民也不會吃這些排隊搶購或柴米無着之苦。而現在，饒了這麽一個大灣，終究不能不按經濟常理來行事。此眞所謂「焦頭爛額爲上客」，而當初曲突徙薪之計反被認爲危言聳聽了。不過，政府旣決定補充辦法，則往日中樞當局，尤其財政當局，設計這個「整套辦法」的大員，眼見這兩個月來的經濟危象，也應該有些責任感了吧！否則，政策儘管轉變，社會儘管騷動，而好官依然我自爲之，試問憲法上責任內閣的「責任」一詞究作何解？</p>

<h3>總統解答三問題　上校一版</h3>
<p>（三）對於史氏所提「中國世界反共鬥爭中之重要性，中國在另一世界大戰之地位，及若果不幸共黨控制中國，對世界局勢將發生何種影響」之問題，總統答復如下：</p>
<p>中國正在努力剿共，以消弭足以威脅世界和平之有力因素，以阻止第三次世界大戰之發生。因之，余不擬對中國在未來世界戰爭中持有如何地位一點，表示意見，但在世界廿一億人口之中，亞洲人口佔百分之五十以上，而中國人口在亞洲十一億人口之中，又佔三分之一强，亞洲在世界中之地位，以及中國在亞洲中之地位，其重要性不待多言而可知。余欲在此指出者：第一，亞洲各民族無論政治組織，經濟生活，社會基礎或文化水準，皆不及歐西各國之進步，在普遍貧窮飢餓之中，共黨主義之宣傳及組織活動，有易於收效。第二，共產國際實行世界革命之傳統策略，及其當前擴張之方向，皆以亞洲爲主要目標，而亞洲之前途，又以中國爲決定點。共產黨之信條，欲控制世界，必先控制亞洲，欲控制亞洲，又必先控制中國。余可斷言，中國如爲共黨所控制，第三次世界大戰，必由此發生，使人類重罹悲慘之災禍。若中國政府果能消滅今日之共匪，則下一次大戰，存在於亞洲之因素，將因而消除，而世界第三次大戰爆發之可能性，亦可因而减少。中國共匪，擁有武裝部隊，其橫暴狡詐，非任何民主國家之共黨主義者所可比擬，然而中國政府，從不因本身所遭遇之艱難及所受之損害而放棄其對世界對友邦應負之責任，無論國際環境有何種變遷，中國始終一貫格守國際信義，並克盡其道義責任，在過去反侵略戰爭中如此，在今日反共鬥爭中亦復如此。</p>
<p>余深信世界反共鬥爭，必須保持整一之陣綫，西歐與東亞原無輕重之分，然而西歐各國有進步之工業及較高之文化水準，民族主義及民主政治，更有一百五十年以上之歷史，深植其根底於人民生活與思想之中。彼等對於共產主義之抵抗，所倚賴於美國物資及道義之援助，遠不如亞洲各民族之迫切，美國人民及其政治家，如眞爲人類謀幸福當從世界上最廣大之區域與數量最多而生活最爲痛苦之人民着手，提高其生活與文化水準，助成其獨立自由。而今日欲使世界人類得免於第三次世界大戰之災禍，尤須拯救亞洲，而拯救亞洲之努力，又應以中國爲重心，此實爲人類歷史上空前之偉大事業，余願美國人民及其政治家引爲巴任。（完）</p>

<h3>迦勒利全區入猶軍掌握　阿猶昨遵令停戰　安理會小組委會修正通過中英建議　美英對聖地政策待調整</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社海發卅一日電〕以色列政府通知此間之休戰委員會稱，以色列政府已下令北戰綫之以色列軍，在今晨八時實行停戰。此間聯合國監察團長要求黎巴嫩政府亦有同一舉措。據北戰綫監察員傳來消息稱，黎巴嫩已於三十日下午四時下令停戰，但隨後爲實行自衛重行開火</p>
<p>〔合衆社泰勒維夫卅一日電〕以色列卅一日宣佈稱：停戰限期於卅一日上午十一時吿終前，猶軍在巴勒斯坦北部之閃電攻勢，已控制迦勒利全區。戰爭僅四十八小時，考克契部下之阿拉伯非正規軍卽已放棄中迦勒利，傳該地四處均可見白旗鹽揚。</p>
<p>〔合衆社台拉維夫卅日電〕以色列軍三十日在巴勒斯坦北部展開陸空聯合主力攻勢，佔據泰西拉（在海發東北二十里）地方之阿拉伯據點，並繼續向前壓迫，以國對聯合國之停戰令親若無睹。大部份聯合國停戰觀察員已撤退至離戰綫南數哩之鐵勃勒斯地方。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎卅日電〕安理會小組委會已於今日通過中英兩國對聖地之建議，烏克蘭代表曾反對此一建議，法國亦企圖取消建議中關於可能之經濟外交制裁部份，而其他三國則支持到底。中英建議最後卒被通過。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三十日電〕巴勒斯坦事件在最近之將來，不能獲得解決，因安理會現正取延宕辦法，以待美國政局傾向之有明確表示，及英美兩國調整對於此事之立塲。目下此一事件，僅由安理會之特別小組委會處理。該小組會經艱苦之工作，數次否決與採納數建議案並修正案後，已同意一種試驗建議案，其中規定：（一）尼基夫區阿尊兩軍撤至調解員所劃定之臨時防綫；（二）繼續開始談判劃定確切之防綫；（三）組織七人委員會審議應否按照聯合國憲章第四十一條對於漠視安理會命令之方面取制裁計劃。此項建議案經整理後，將提交安理會核准。同時據此間聯合國休息室中之意見，美代表團將建議將巴勒斯坦事件，延至明年二月或三月間聯大會在紐約開會作最後解決。</p>
<h3>美新總統選出前聯大工作陷停頓　杜威如當選美外交政策不變</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎卅日電〕在美國於十一月二日舉行大選前，工作停頓之聯合國，卅日相信如杜威當選，美國外交政策在基本上很少有變動。代表等在辯論聯合國中少數問題時皆心不在焉而在等待。在美國選出總統前，聯合國工作幾無進行可能。事實上，聯合國各代表對報軍所謂杜威在總統競選中較杜魯門佔優勢之說，均深信不疑。</p>
<p>但預料總統易人而外交政策無大變動者，亦爲美國歷史上之第一次。據一西方國家之官員等談稱：「吾人所關懷者不在明年一月一日以後之美國外交政策如何，但在政府當局一旦易人後，自十一月二日至一月間之美國外交政策如何」。爲消釋對杜威當選後美國代表團處境如何之疑賽計，此間許多外交家希望杜威於選舉後發表一項聲明，澄淸杜威對於美代表團所負任務之態度。</p>

<h3>國際技術合作西不應被擯</h3>
<p>英美支持阿根廷建議</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎三十日電〕英美兩國三十日採取一種能度，認爲西班牙不應被擯除於「純屬技術方面」之國際合作，諸如聯合國所管制之經濟統計組織。彼等在聯合國法律委會中主張，聯合國一九四六抵制西班牙決議案之原則，不應施用於技術方面。彼等支持阿根廷之建議，該建議主張讓西班牙加入在國際經濟統計組織。該組織之工作本由國聯所祖任，現已移交聯合國。蘇聯及其衛星國·法國。及若干拉丁美洲國家反對此議，彼等指出此議達反聯合國要求各會員國撤退駐西使節之決議案，該決議案亦曾擯除西班牙於特殊性機構之外。</p>
<h3>希臘發生政潮　蘇福里斯總理凖備辭職　外長蔡爾達理斯可能奉命組閣</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典卅一日電〕希臘政治危機預料卽將發生，希自由黨方面消息，蘇福里斯總理將在國會開會時，不能獲得國會多數離員信任後而吿辭職，繼起組閣之人選，可能仍爲蘇福里斯，然渠必須在內閣人選上有大批更動。又據人民黨方面消息，希外長蔡爾達理斯預料將於今日返雅典，可能奉命組閣，因人民黨係議會中佔極多數之黨派也。</p>

<h3>公務員法案通過前　日本國會暫不解散　吉田在幹部會議中主張</h3>

<h3>錢幣的奧妙　銀幣銅幣各有千餘種之多　同樣具有歷史文化價值　國人研究集藏知名者僅數人</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕幣的收藏和硏究，在我國不及集郵嗜好的普遍，但集幣與集郵同樣地具有歷史與文化的價値，在世界各國博物院中皆有錢幣陳列，收羅極爲宏富，以美國而論，錢幣的愛好與收藏者據說有十萬人以上，各大都市均有錢幣學會的組織，而我國現有比較知名的錢幣收集者，則全國不過四五人而已。</p>
<p>我國錢幣中有收藏價値的除紙幣外，硬幣，大類僅銀銅兩種，銀幣有袁頭，孫頭，船洋，龍洋之分，銅幣有光緒元寳，大淸銅幣，雙旗銅元之分。在普通人看來，所有的硬幣不出這幾種範疇，有何珍貴足言？但在藏家目光中，則珍品何止千百種類。無論銀幣或銅幣，或則製造地域不同，或則流傳僅有數枚，或則圖案各異，或則製版時有錯誤，或則具有紀念價値，祗要稍有一絲特異之處，都是他們獵取的目標而視作名貴的珍品、甚至有許多種類的分別，僅在極微細的花紋中毫末之差，必須用顯微鏡才能看得出來，因此在藏家說來，銀幣與銅幣的種類，至少都各在一千種以上。</p>
<p>最早的銀元　在廣束鑄造</p>
<p>記者昨天訪問沐市一位錢幣硏究家又是收藏家張璜，從他那裏看到了許多稀有的珍品。</p>
<p>我國最早的銀元是在光緒十三年於廣東正式開鑄，其時的重量是每枚七錢三分，目的爲抵制墨西哥七錢二分的銀幣，不料行之未久，因其銀量較重，竟被人專事收熔以純銀出售而博漁利，此後乃改鑄七錢二分幣，在圖案方面亦有變化，最初正面內圈爲光緒元寳，外圈爲洋文「廣東省造七綫三分」等字，反面則爲龍及中文「廣東省造，七錢三分」等字，此項銀元製成後，淸室大爲不樂，因正面圖案無異象徵光緒皇帝為洋人所包圍，乃下令改製，將洋文移至反面，而將反面中文移至正面外圈，卽爲此後流通之形式，原先之式樣稱爲反版，茲已不可多得矣。</p>
<p>一枚的價值逾一千金圓</p>
<p>袁世凱稱帝時，製有洪憲飛龍幣，正面爲袁世凱像，反面爲有翼之龍及「中華帝國，洪憲紀元」等字，極爲稀見特式，但此一珍品，竟不及一湖北省造龍洋之名貴，因該龍洋背後龍旁列有「本省」兩字，爲千萬中不易得一之品，時値據說超過金圓千圓，誠非圈外人所能瞭解也。</p>
<p>袁頭孫頭幣應極普通，但又不盡然，如有一孫幣背後英文BIRTH錯爲RIBIH，一袁頭左右多甘肅兩字，乃又成珍品了。</p>
<p>九星旗十文最名貴銅幣</p>
<p>銅幣中最名貴者爲安徽省造九星旗十文，次之爲江西辛亥大漢十文及廣西光緒元寳十文。戰前民國廿四年間其君曾以一千二百元購進江西辛亥大漢十分一枚，可見其餘。式樣新頴者，當推哈爾濱一分幣，圖案爲一兵船，寓意建設海軍，此種至今祗見兩品。普通銅元當値爲十文二十文，當値最大者爲河南雙旗，當五百文，當値特殊者爲四川之當三十銅元。洪憲稱帝時，亦曾開製銅幣，未稱帝時，武昌造幣廠已試製袁做十文銅元兩種，均未流通，尤以面部龐大之一種，傳世不及十枚，其他人像銅元有孫總理·徐世昌。唐繼堯等，均極難得。民國廿五年朱哲元執政華北時，曾試製平津銅元廿種，現國內僅馬定祥氏藏有全套，極爲珍重。</p>
<p>銅元在抗戰時被日人劫掠去者爲數甚鉅，最近已陸續歸還，其中或不乏大好珍品，又自新幣制實施後，央行收兌銀幣已達六百餘萬枚，偌大數目中必有極爲珍貴之品，若均全部溶化改製新幣極爲可惜，收藏家均希望政府能遴派專家將其中珍品選出，分送全國各地博物館陳列，在國家爲保存歷史文物，在人民則可有欣賞研究之機會。</p>
<h3>收藏家希望古幣應保存</h3>
<p>錢幣收藏家最近所担心不安的事是改革幣制以來，政府對於希見古幣未有明令准予持有，若亦如普通金銀一樣必須繳兌，則古物淪亡，至堪痛惜，若仍保有，又恐觸犯法令，所以中國泉幣學社已呈文財政部。社會局及中央銀行等，請求明令准許民間繼續持有，他們認為幣之希與不希，是否有收藏價値，可由專家鑒別及錢幣書籍參考，不致爲人假借收藏家爲名而以囤積爲實，但此一請求，至今政府尙無表示云。</p>

<h3>一般物價　限價交易無從進行物物交換應運而生</h3>
<p>上週中樞當局迭有重要會議召開，檢討當前經濟問題，限價應否繼續維持，尤爲爭論的焦點。市塲在此種空氣籠罩下，又因十月底屆臨，傅聞自十一月份起，限價有關整之說，一般人士，不論買進賣出，更增加其暫抱觀望的態度，屬遵八一九的限價交易，幾乎頻於絕跡。</p>
<p>反之，在黑市方面，則傳聞漲風銳厲，據悉已有較原價超過十倍以上者，銀根根緊俏，暗息高昂，由於若千種黑市的活動，已使有近五億元的游資，被捲入此種漩渦。零星物品，購貿亦極不易，卽以一簡單家庭而論，所需米·油·糖等物，無一不須排隊購質，數量限制極微，每候數小時，落後者卽有向隅之慮。限價政策，是否正確，周尙未成定論，但就目前情况而論，確已引起大多數人的生活，極感不便，實有針對事實，速謀改善的必要。</p>
<p>在前述的情形下，限價交易，旣無從進行，於是物物交換，應運而生，盛行一時，茲就其犖犖大者，列舉如次：</p>
<p>（一）種食部糧食緊急購儲會主任楊綽庵稱，與中樞各有關機關商討，十一月份六大都市配售糧源之籌搭問題，關於配售糧源之籌劃，因礙於限價，現已面臨兩種困難。一是鄉村與城市物資不能交流，造成產區高於市價，第二是各產地禁糧出境，現經過各方洽商，上項困難可謂已吿解决，針對策一困難，緊急購儲會決定以紗布換取糧食，中央銀行已配撥棉紗六千件，棉布六萬疋，業由緊急會點收竣事，此批紗布將以三四成換取十一月份之配糧，預料可換得米五十萬市石，小麥五十萬市石。</p>
<p>（二）國棉聯合採購委員會決定：（一）以一件二十支棉紗爲標準，交換二件二十支棉紗所需之棉花，其不足之數，付給金圓券。（二）爲獎勵棉農，收購工作得能順利推進起見，關於付給金圓券部份，如超出規定辦法時，將視情形，發給若干獎勵金。（三）中央銀行前已答允先撥出棉紗一萬件，今日可以提貨，分別運至產棉區從事收購國棉，將來棉紗如感不敷時，可由中央銀行再撥前行總棉紗，及美援棉花紗布聯營處內撥出內銷部份之棉紗，前往易棉。（四）本市棉商等如有棉花，亦可按照上述交換辦法，比率交換。</p>
<p>（三）無鍚物資調節委員會決定，可能供應上海物資第一批麵粉二萬包，卽起運。無錫需要上海供應物資，計糖一萬二千担。肥皂三千五百箱，捲烟二千五百萬枝，火柴四百箱，棉紗三千餘件，棉布六萬疋。</p>
<p>自財政經濟緊急處分令頒行兩月來，以至經濟演變到目前極端不正常的情况，經當局連日商討後，已搬訂有關經濟措施方案，以謀補數，該方案由行政院秘書長李惟果，於上週五携飛北平，呈總統核示中。此外各有關機開及憂時之士，對於當前經濟局勝，亦紛紛呼籲。</p>
<p>（一）監察院經濟資源農林水利委員會，財政糧食委員會及內政地政委員會，廿六日舉行聯席會議，檢討當前經濟情勢，快議列舉通貨膨脹，生產减縮，貨物廠置，銀根鬆濫，黑市高漲等事實，向政院提出糾正案，促其針對此種嚴重現象，速謀有效之制止。</p>
<p>（二）立法院於廿九日舉行第十五次會議，立委陳明仙提出臨時緊急動議。「請提出急救當前經濟危機辦法，咨請政府執行案」。陳氏提出的救急辦法爲：（一）徵借豪門資本。（二）徵借大戶囤積物資。（三）以金圓券收兌之金銀外匯，購取民生日用原料。（四）高價購貿共匪侵佔區物資。（五）實施全面配給，先由大都市着手，（六）工廠原料配給。（七）大量舉辦農貸。（八）日用品取消限價。（九）國營事業調整價格。（十）公敎人員照物價指數發薪。</p>
<p>（三）北平各院校敎授朱光濟等十七人，聯名擬具長數千言的「爲民請命。解除人爲的苦難與不平醫」，請胡適校長轉呈總統及翁院長。該書指出物價上漲的原因爲「物價上漲，雖然主要由於通貨膨脹，但生產减少，物資缺乏，貨幣流通的區域縮小，戰亂不安的心理影響，都同樣可以使物價的上漲」。要求政府的主張：「（一）金圓券的成功限度，在能按八一九的限價，由政府實行按人口配給主要生活品。（二）由政府加稅公用事業作合理的加價，籌這筆貼補配給給費。（三）其他限價一概取消，更無須議價，維持自由市塲，使經濟活動不停滯，而且不影響一般人的基本生活」。</p>
<h3>貨幣金融　銀根緊勢轉入高暗息創改幣後新紀錄</h3>
<p>上週本市銀根緊勢，可謂已逹高潮，與法幣時代銀根一鬆一緊之現象，亦極類似。其中原因雖多，但要而言之，這不過是惡性通貨膨脹應有的結局，顧前瞻後，不能不令人感慨萬端！</p>
<p>上週屆臨月底，市上對頭寸的需要，自可能比平常迫切些。至於醞釀中的新管制經濟方案，一般的看法，又以爲非加以放寬不可，於是頭寸的搜羅者，更見衆多，好像只要拆到款子，購些物資，在不遠的將來，總是比較便宜的。說到資金的供給者，當然也是同樣心理，於是頭寸的供求失衡，造成暗息的逐步上升，與改幣以前的市息相較，亦無愧色，於此不難預感：甫告安靜兩個多月的金融局面，又要恢復到萬分嚴重的階段了。</p>
<p>使銀根轉入緊悄的另一主因，是游資的大量外流與南流。游資流入四鄕，果然是爲了在管制的夾縫裏尋求生路，游資的大量南流，亦可在兌成港幣，或其他貨幣後而保存幣値，據估計，近數日來，資金南流之總數，已達五百萬金圓，甚至有說日達約二百五十萬元以上者。資金南流與銀根告緊，實在亦是「八一九」改幣前的舊調重彈。</p>
<p>上週國家行局的交換差額，雖無確切數字可稽，但報載由於經手匯往外埠款項及配糖配布等價款收繳，頗有差進，這自然也就助長了緊潮的波蘭。外商銀行一週來也頗多差進，大抵與資金南流有關。</p>
<p>銀根緊倘的結果之一，是暗息高昂，上週週一，市息已出二角關，週三則已高見三角了。週四週五，日拆做十五六元的亦甚不少，合息爲四角五分，這是改幣以來所未見過的。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面，缺單甚爲普邊，因而其間有向業外補單者，問業拆放，於是益見繁盛，週一行莊對客戶提現限額，在五百元左右，超過額度，則一概付本票，改幣前本票滿街走的景象，又宛在目前。</p>
<p>上週一，台粤匯款，均受限制，於是資金外流，採運現方式者甚多，現鈔籌碼，遂感異常緊絀，較大額票面現鈔之貼水迭有所見，據說在千分之四到千分之八之間，現鈔短絀往往是與銀根緊俏同時發生的。</p>
<p>上週內匯率，雖無大變更，但黑市匯率，竟猛烈挺升，尤以漢口，重慶，兩地爲最。據報載，每千元俱在五十元左右，重慶利率，日拆已達廿五元，此間乃紛調款回渝，轉放子金，漢口方面，則爲資金南流逃港關係，致造成改幣後最高之黑市匯率。中國銀行，對漢渝兩地巨額匯款，已停止代匯，三千元以上者酌予匯兌，對穗匯款除私人瞻家費外，中行對工商匯款亦一律停止。</p>
<p>上週外匯行市，官價無變更。香港黄金每華兩，週一爲三〇三。五元，週二起卽升爲三〇六元，週四仍維持週二之原價，香港美元市價稍降，週一爲五·二八港元，週二至週四均爲五·二六元。</p>
<h3>台糖公司加強增產擴充蔗田二千餘頃</h3>
<p>據台糖公司消息：該公司本年度甘蔗種植之面積，爲十一萬四千二百五十餘公頃，其中留二萬二千一百五十餘公頃，作明年度蔗苗之用，迄目前止，本年所收獲之甘蔗產量，已超過理想數量。刻該公司爲求再度實現甘蔗增產計劃，已鎭密擬定將明年度之簾田種植面積，擴充五十一萬六千三百九十餘公頃，較本年度增加二千餘公頃，卽將開始植蔗，預計明年度台糖之總產量，可較今年增加數萬噸云。</p>

<p>——切道德學說，若與社會生活之體系不相容，則都是無力的—克魯泡特金</p>
<p>動和儉是一向被認爲美德的，但其限度却該因環境時代的不同而各異。如果一定要膠柱鼓瑟言隨着古人亦步亦趨，則所表現的所謂美德，只是說明自己的沒有進步，至少是生活藝術的沒有進步。</p>
<p>譬如說：「日出而作日入而息」是古人的勤，而現在我們在「作息」之外，至少還該有點相當的娛樂來調劑；「簞食瓢飲」是古人的儉，現在我們除把食作果腹的工具外，更應該注意營養的攝取。這不是苛求，是必要；不是浪費，是正確。因爲現在的時代與環境和古人不同，人類當跟隨時代的進步而進步，否則便是落後，是忽視現實。</p>
<p>這樣說，並不是反對勤和儉，更不是提倡懶惰和奢侈。而是說：勤和儉該有它適宜的限度。否則一日工作廿四時，勤則動矣，其工作效率如何呢？三餐只寨糙米飯，儉則儉矣，其營養程度又如何呢？</p>
<p>只要把時代想一想，國粹家大可不必常作今人不如古人的歎息了。</p>
<p>自從當局提倡節約以後，響應的眞是風起雲湧。足見人心未死，國是可爲。當然，在國步維艱的今日，凡屬國民都有節衣縮食以助軍需，努力工作以增生產的必要。可是當局所昭示我們的是捐除不必要的浪費，並不是廢止正當的需要，條文具在，大可仔細研究。但若干響應者却往往矯枉過正，强人之難，這却又使我懷疑他們只是口頭的宣佈了。</p>
<p>現在試舉出矯枉過正的一個例證：</p>
<p>「廣州名人程××，發起建築劇儉新村，規定入村居住者：一·不准私有汽車；二·不設私人廚房；三·一·不穿洋裝皮鞋。」（見本月廿日本報）</p>
<p>有自備汽車的人，是否會加人該村？姑置不論。單從汽車本身說，是否一定奢侈，便大有問題。我想如果不是白痴便該明瞭坐汽車去處理要事與坐着汽車去跳舞或打牌的不同。難道坐汽車的人便不該儉，不能儉，不要他儉嗎？，此其一。</p>
<p>「不設私人廚房」，更是强逼各個不同的家庭，來過自己個人的理想生活。總之，是强人所難。試問：旣不是一個團體又不是一隊部隊，爲什麼一定要吃「大鍋飯」？此其二。</p>
<p>西裝，也就是國粹家的所謂「胡服」，皮鞋，我斗膽秉承「家」們的訓導，姑名之日，「夷腹」，覺得比「革履」兩字更義正詞嚴。但長袍馬褂是什麽服呢？現在的鞋也和古人的相去甚遠。爲什麼前者一定是奢，而後者才合乎儉？此其三。</p>
<p>勤儉而必須提偶，足見不該有人我厚薄之分，然而却要約法三章，繃緊面皮，道便莫怪淺薄如我聳者的莫測高深了。</p>
<p>這段話，並不是單獨對廣州的程某而發的，何况他的熱心也値欽佩。我們的主要目標，是希望擁有登高一呼的賢達們，要有計劃，便該來一個切切實的計劃；要做工作，便該來一個可言可行工作。萬不要忽視現實，纏錯時代，兩眼向天地大發其高不可攀的宏論。誠惶誠恐，企予望之。</p>

<p>運宵歸路掛燈痕，握手殊奇車笠繁，大半三年五年別，難傾一日兩日言；時淸可有彈冠者，木落誰招蹈海魂？閑倚西風支冷眼，枯荷搖水半湖渾。</p>
<h3>簽到值日</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>每一個機關，人事管理，爲了職負的考勸，必有簽到簿的設置。員工每天上下午的上班，例必要簽到。簽到的方法有二；一是用街筆寫姓名，二是蓋私章，有些幷要註明到班的時間。在表面看來，人事管理的考勤。可謂週到了。加以簽到簿的收取，多數是在規定辦公時間上班後的十五分鐘，主一管的在簿子上簽名，如發現有沒有簽名的空格，（因爲每一個職員簽名的位置，早經編定。）主管的使用筆的一實直下，這是表明某天沒有上班。人事管理的便卽檢査此人是否吿假，如果沒有吿假，列入曠職。或是此人趕來補簽，列入遲到。曠職與遲到，在考勤方面，都有嚴格規定的辦法。</p>
<p>可是啊，事實上機關裏的簽到，徒有其名，而是作僞欺騙的表現。有些職員得了主管長官的特許，可以免簽到；有些另有靠山的，不管許不許也不簽到；有些是由同事代簽，有些是囑工役代簽。（蓋名章的作弊更容易了。）有的上午預簽下午，有的今日預簽明日。主管的和人事處（室）絕沒有派人監簽。因此實際的自己簽到的只有十之二三而已。最大的原因，是一般職位稍高的職員不依時上班，那麼，小職員對於遲到早退是一般的現象。爲了人浮於事，主管的多有兼職，工作不緊張，絕不是如銀行職員一樣，每一個人都管理一宗事，今天辦不了，明天便積壓起來，不得不循序的去辦。因此造成遲到早退的陋習，而有些主管的對於三數職員，另眼相看，明知道某人遲到或礦職，而不能秉公辦理，反而在考績時，予以升級加薪。人事管理員也碍於主管的意見與情面，也不敢依據「人事獨立」的去爭論。原因複雜，簽字簿便成了具文，沒有什麽奇異了。</p>
<p>然而每一個機關，每一個職員，雖都感到簽到簿是作偽與欺騙的象徵，可是却沒有人提出把它撤銷廢棄，這就是「相率爲偽」的官樣文章。</p>
<p>與簽字簿同樣無曰聊的，便是値日。所謂値日（軍憲警機關除外），是在規定辦公時間之外，由員工輪流値班，其時間多是在下午五時起至第二天早晨八時半，和例假日全天。所謂値日，大事不能辦，小事不必辦，卽使有些要辦的事也辦不通。因爲不屬於値日者本人所熟諳的事，無從辦理，最多亦不過臨時收發些函電而已。爲了辦十公時間外發函電而要留幾個非收發組的員工去辦理，未免小題大做，勞民傷財（値日的照例可得値班費）。而一般値日的，只是在第二天的値日簿上，寫幾句照例文章，如「收發函電幾件，其他幷無事件發生」等語，蓋一個圖章移交便了。實際上他是沒有値日的，只是吩咐値日的工友代爲照料而已。所以機關的値日，也等於簽到薄的慮偽，公家天天虛耗了値班費，實際上沒有得到什麽結果。現在有些機關把値日取銷，而責成一兩個在機關寄宿的員工，在公衆散班後，負責收受外來函電，每月酌給津貼費，這是較爲合理的，可惜照此辦理的還是寥若晨星。</p>

<h3>無言</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>孔子說：「予欲無言。」有人說他老人家周遊歷國，到處碰了壁回來，纔說這句喪氣的話。我說以爲朱必如此。君子言必顧行，必顧言，孔子決非今日火砲之流，說出了話不能兌現，與其不能兌現，還不如不說爲妙。任何思想家的高妙境界，都不注重言說。老子固然已說過：「知者不言」。莊子也中張「得意忘言」。釋迦牟尼說法，提到人生究竟，只是說「不可思議，不可思議，不可說，不可說」。男女間戀愛的最高程度，也決不是空喊「愛啊！愛啊！」說是「心心相」。絕然不需假以言說。</p>
<p>更懺水滸傳上的李逵，裝扮啞道童的時候，需要拿一枚制錢塞在嘴巴裏，綫能不講話。我幼年看到這段書，每每發笑。今日展卷重讀，竟不再有輕鬆發笑之感，只覺得天涯到處有李達，裝扮啞道童的李逵！嗚呼—予欲無言。——然而，我終於又說了這些話，其終且爲饒舌之豐千歟？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>變態時期自然發生許多特別名詞，思之令人忍俊不禁，閱之令人哭笑不得。如「豪鬥」二字，年來喧騰衆口，遍及全國，人人耳熟能詳，且是「千夫所指」矣，而未見有明晰之定義。大致看來，似是「特權厚利而又超然於國法制裁之外者·」斯其所以異於昔年十目所視之「財閥」「軍閥」而別成一隊也。於是懲辦貪汚曰「豪鬥如何？」檢査囤積，搗把日「豪門如何？」而「豪門」遂爲衆　之所歸。按「豪」之一字，原是美詞，倚馬萬言工而且速者謂之「文筆」；斗酒百篇，謂之「詩豪」；才大志高，心雄萬夫，卓爾不羣者謂之「人豪」·古云「聖賢豪傑」，豪傑之士，僅次於聖賢一等耳。惟「土豪劣紳」爲世詬病，然病在「土劣」，不在「豪紳」，亦猶「貪官汚吏」所惡在「貪汚」，非「官吏」也。而今之所謂「豪門」，則怙權　利玩法亂紀之稱，是「豪」字之大不幸也。况又綴之以「門」，比「朱門酒肉臭」之門，「侯門一入深如海」之門，非「禮門義路」之門也！</p>
<p>又如「打虎」與「捕蠅」對舉，亦見南北報章，大衆呼喊非一日矣。實卽「豺狼當道，安問狐狸」之變詞，似乎比較新穎活潑些兒，亦可爲「豪門」下一註脚。惜乎中國缺乏科學之素餐，儘管新名詞信口而出，層出不窮，而忽略了先下明確之定義。年來不是不曾懲辦貪汚，辦了一個，衆譁然曰：「此　耳，非虎也！」又辦一個，又雖然曰：「此小虎也，非大虎也！」又辦一個，又譁然日：「此偽虎也，非眞虎也！」究竟至何程度乃爲大虎？如何人物爲眞虎？則惝悅　離莫衷一是。是以徒覺然爲不平之鳴，而迄無「平其不平」之實效。</p>
<p>新自南來平津處理敵僞產業之政委何公，在津招待各界，發表長篇演詞，以敵僞各產多爲勢力強佔，今決澈底解決，强制搬移，語甚明快。且日一願趕走豪門，不趕難民，決先辦上民，後辦下民。」按「上民」「下民」兩詞，亦甚新妙。「下民」二字，古尙有之，如州縣衙門「戒石」飼「下民易虐，上天難欺」是也。今更添「上民」二字與之對舉，亦是「豪門」之又一註脚。皆語云：「吃盡苦中苦，方爲人上人。」今之「民上民」當作何解，大耐人恩矣。……自來水公司覆本報讀者……</p>

<h3>Premier Weng Will Report New Financial and Economic Measures to the Legislative Yuan Tomorrow and Answer Questions in a Closed Session</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] The 16th regular meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 2nd. A closed meeting will be held first, with Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan and responsible officials from relevant ministries in attendance. They will report on the current financial and economic situation and the measures taken by the government to answer the written inquiries submitted by the Legislative Yuan on two occasions due to the temporary motions of Wen Shiyuan and Chen Mingxian, and listen to the opinions of the legislators and answer other inquiries. The general agenda will be conducted publicly after the closed meeting. The items for report include three draft laws submitted by the Executive Yuan for review, including the Draft Law of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, one case submitted by the Examination Yuan for incorporation into the salary grade law for review of the Public Service Salary Table, and the report of the Budget, Finance, and Economic Resources Committees on the proposed establishment of a Commission for the Investigation of State-Owned Enterprises, which concluded that there was no need for on-site investigation, and requested the General Assembly to make a decision. The matters for discussion include the Draft Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Free Education for Children of Revolutionary Anti-Japanese War Heroes, the Draft Regulations on Temporary Property Tax, and the Draft Regulations on the Implementation of the Regulations on Temporary Property Tax, which were not processed at the previous meeting. Only two new cases have been added: (1) the Finance Committee's report on the review of the case of allowing the import tax exemption for American aid wheat and flour, (2) the Grain Administration Committee's report on the review of the case of improving urban grain rationing as proposed by Li Yu et al., and the temporary motions of Li Yaolin et al. and Li Feng et al. related to improving urban grain rationing.</p>
<h3>Rigid Regulations on Adjustment of Salaries for Public Servants and Teachers Canceled</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] After the President convened an important meeting on the evening of the 30th to make the final decisions in principle on the new supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, the temporary Executive Yuan meeting was convened at 9:00 AM on the 31st for discussion. The original proposal had rigid regulations on the standards for adjusting the salaries of public servants and teachers, increasing them by 50%, that is, changing the base figure to 60 yuan as previously reported by this newspaper, and increasing the rest by 50% in proportion. However, during the discussion, many believed that the adjustment ratio was too small and could not keep up with prices. It was decided to cancel the rigid regulations in the original proposal and formulate separate measures. There was not much discussion on the other points. The resolution was obtained in about an hour. After the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, all attendees kept their mouths shut and did not release the contents for the time being. At 4:00 PM, Executive Yuan Premier Weng Wenhao presented the revised plan to the President for final review, and it was released by the Executive Yuan Information Bureau at 5:00 PM. The case will be reported to the Legislative Yuan by Weng on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Between Gold Yuan and Taiwan Dollar Changed to 1 to 1,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 31st] Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan telegraphed Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming on the 31st, stating: The exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the Taiwan dollar will be changed to 1 to 1,000 from November 1st. If it is necessary to adjust the exchange rate thereafter, the Taiwan Provincial Chairman is allowed to submit his opinion to the Executive Yuan for approval. The original exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the Taiwan dollar was 1 to 1,835 yuan.</p>
<h3>Legislative Member Huang Yuming Discusses Key Points of Saving the Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] Legislative member Huang Yuming discussed the key points of saving the situation with reporters on the 31st regarding the current situation. After pointing out six contradictions in national affairs, Huang advocated: (1) Announce to the world that the Soviet Union has violated its treaty and instigated the Chinese Communists to create chaos, appeal to and share with the national military aid, and mobilize the whole people to defend themselves. (2) Authorize the war zone's military powers, open up local political powers, and eliminate the communist bandits. (3) The Legislative Yuan should have a one-year recess and authorize the president to decide on national affairs expediently. (4) Continue to limit the prices of daily necessities, relax the prices of other goods, levy heavy taxes on luxury goods, and stabilize the lives of civil servants. (5) Please ask President Chiang to strictly enforce party discipline, eliminate factional struggles, promote comrade unity, eliminate corrupt officials, and establish a new political direction.</p>
<h3>The Sale of Enemy and Puppet Properties Will Be Handled in Accordance with the Corrected Proposal Passed by the Executive Yuan at a Temporary Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] The Control Yuan considered the sale of enemy and puppet properties to be inappropriate and submitted a corrected proposal to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan submitted it for discussion at a temporary political meeting on the 31st and resolved that all properties other than those that have already been sold will be handled in accordance with the corrected proposal submitted by the Control Yuan.</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Carrier Arrives in Qingdao; Not Intended to Withdraw US Troops, Says US Navy Spokesman</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] A Navy Department spokesman said on the 30th: The arrival of the aircraft carrier "Tarawa" and the "Valley Forge" in Qingdao should not be interpreted as the United States intending to withdraw from Qingdao. He acknowledged that if senior US authorities decided to take this action, then a withdrawal would be possible, but the arrival of the two aircraft carriers in Qingdao was planned some time ago. The spokesman pointed out that the Navy Department had announced in September that the Tarawa and Valley Forge would leave San Diego on October 1 for "routine work in the Far East Pacific." He added that in addition to the two aircraft carriers, other warships are also on their way to join the aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers in Qingdao. He stressed that this transfer is also of a routine nature and is not an emergency measure ordered because of the recent retreat of Chinese National Army troops in the Northeast and North China.</p>
<h3>The Central Political Committee Will Meet This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee is scheduled to hold a memorial week meeting on the morning of the 1st, followed by a report by Weng Wenhao on the deliberations of the Executive Yuan's resolution on the supplementary measures for financial and economic reform.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Will Arrive in Shanghai Tonight After Passing Through India</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 31st] Foreign Minister Wang and his party arrived at New Delhi Airport by Pan American Airlines plane on the morning of the 31st. After the plane stopped here for one hour, it continued to fly to Calcutta. Because the plane was six hours behind its original schedule, Wang and his party are expected to arrive in Shanghai at 11:00 PM on November 1st. A reporter asked Wang, "Is it true, as reported by the Indian side, that the date for the next Pan-Asian Relations Conference to be held in China next year has been confirmed as a result of the meeting between Prime Minister Nehru and representatives of various Asian countries in Paris?" Foreign Minister Wang replied: Because I left Paris earlier, I am not aware of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Presidential Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Presidential Order of November 1st: (1) Appointing Weng Jiaohao as a member of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Management Committee. (2) Appointing Ju Zheng and Wang Chonghui, members of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Management Committee, as standing members of the committee. (3) Specifically appointing Tang Shengzhi as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee.</p>
<h3>The President's Sixty-Second Birthday; Celebrations Held with Flags Hung and Evening Parties in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The 31st was the President's sixty-second birthday, and celebrations were held in various parts of the country, with flags hung and evening parties held. Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi of Beiping delivered a birthday speech at the evening party, encouraging the armed comrades present with the words, "The more efforts we make, the less worries the President will have."</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 31st] On the President's birthday, the Northwest Official Public Office held a birthday celebration evening party on the 31st, which was personally presided over by Zhang Zhizhong, and performed the Henan Opera "Magu Offering Longevity."</p>
<h3>If the Communist Bandits Control the Nine Provinces of the Northeast, World War Will Begin From This Point; The President Answers Three Questions From American Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 31st] New York Herald Tribune reporter A. Steele met with President Chiang on the 29th in Beiping and asked questions about the current situation, requesting the President to answer them. The President expressed his views on three questions:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the question of "what are the basic reasons for the temporary setbacks of the National Army at present," the President replied as follows:</p>
<p>The government's consistent military policy, whether in the War of Resistance against Japan or the suppression of bandits, has been solely for the purpose of maintaining national territorial sovereignty and protecting the lives and property of the people. Therefore, not a single city or place can be easily abandoned. China fought the War of Resistance against Japan for eight years, with the recovery of the Northeast as its goal. After the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Army risked danger to take over the Northeast, and its important areas could not be easily abandoned. The traditional thinking and sense of responsibility of the Chinese army are that coexistence with the land is the only duty of a soldier, and that leaving a city and abandoning defense is a shame to a soldier. Therefore, for three years, the National Army has set up defenses everywhere, and its strength has been divided, forming a situation of weakness everywhere. Taking advantage of this weakness, the Communist bandits used the tactic of "the big eating the small" to concentrate all their strength to attack one of our weak points, so they were repeatedly defeated one by one. This is why the current serious situation has gradually been created.</p>
<p>The government is a government of the people, and the recruitment of soldiers and the planning of food and supplies must take into account the interests of the people and abide by the laws of the country. The Communist bandits, on the other hand, have no love for the people, indiscriminately issuing counterfeit currency in various regions, confiscating the people's property at any time, conscripting young men, and plundering food, doing everything possible with their cruel means. In the past year, the Communist bandits have used the name of "land reform" to carry out a predatory exploitation, so the strength of the bandit army has expanded greatly for a time. The scorched earth policy of the bandit army when retreating and the "human wave tactics" when attacking are not what the National Army is willing to do. Therefore, when the National Army concentrates its strength to carry out a main battle, it must have a chance of winning. In a certain time and place, it often becomes inferior and suffers setbacks. This is the basic reason for the temporary setbacks of the National Army. Therefore, the government's strategic and tactical tactics for suppressing bandits today must be changed, and military, political, and educational policies should also be thoroughly reformed. We must take the overall situation into consideration in order to win the final success, and not contend for the gains and losses of a certain time and place.</p>
<p>I must also point out that the Communist bandits fighting against the government today are joint military actions of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean communist parties supported by the Communist International, and we should pay special attention to their seriousness. China has always been a weak country, but we have never been afraid of power and violence. We have already fought an eight-year war of resistance against the aggression of Japanese militarists, and we have fought a twenty-five-year struggle against Communist bandits with armed violence. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Revolutionary Army has experienced many setbacks and suffered major failures in every long-term battle in the Northern Expedition, the suppression of bandits, and the War of Resistance against Japan, but in the end, it has always achieved glorious victories. In these twenty-five years, we have repeatedly encountered situations more serious than today, and we have always overcome them. Based on painful experience, we have firm confidence that as long as we make unremitting efforts with a spirit of perseverance, we firmly believe that suppressing the chaos and building the country will reach the final stage of success after this failure. It is hoped that the military and civilians across the country will thoroughly realize the rampantness of the Communist bandits and the crisis of the country, rise up together, share the national crisis, and fulfill their responsibilities to save the country and themselves. What we rely on is the national spirit and the Three Principles of the People, which can never be destroyed by any conspiracy or tyranny. We will never underestimate the seriousness of the bandit situation today, but every offensive launched by the Communist bandits due to the cruel exploitation of the people will exhaust their manpower and material resources, repeat the mistakes of the Jiangxi era, and will eventually be eliminated. If the government can obtain the moral and material assistance of friendly countries sooner and receive the support of international justice, final success can be achieved. It can be asserted.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Steele's question of "whether the government is fully committed to maintaining Shenyang," the President replied as follows:</p>
<p>The government's determination to maintain the territory of the Northeast and the nation's sovereignty in the Northeast has been consistent since the September 18th Incident. If it is said that the entire situation in the Northeast has been militarily defeated since the fall of Jinzhou and Changchun, and the gains and losses of Shenyang are no longer as important as in the past, then the National Army's sacrifice of everything in Shenyang to fight the Communist bandits to the last is the greatest responsibility that our government can fulfill to the people and the world. The Northeast issue is one of the most important international issues, and it has a significant impact on the international situation, especially for countries closely related to the Pacific. For three years, this arduous common responsibility has been borne solely by China. After three years of arduous struggle, China has done its utmost, but it is a great regret that it has not been able to accomplish its mission. As early as seventeen years ago, when the September 18th Incident occurred, I issued a warning to friendly countries around the world and the League of Nations, believing that a world war would begin from this point. At that time, this warning was not valued by various countries, but historical facts proved that the Northeast issue was the prelude to the Second World War. Today, history is repeating itself. If international justice cannot be upheld and democratic countries still adopt an attitude of indifference, they will repeat the mistakes of the past. If the Communist bandits unfortunately control China, another world war will inevitably break out. Even if the Communist bandits control the nine provinces of the Northeast, world war will begin from this point. What is particularly clear is that without a complete Northeast, there will be no independent Korea, nor will there be a peaceful East Asia. I dare say that the dangerous storms in the Pacific will start in the Northeast again. (Continued on page 2)</p>
<h3>Shenyang Presents a Deathly Still State; Military and Political Leaders Have All Flown Out by Plane; People's Uneasy Mood is Different From the Ordinary</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 31st] Wei Lihuang, Zhao Jialu, Wang Tiehan, Dong Wenqi and other top military and political leaders all flew away from Shenyang from Dongling Airport on the 30th, while second- and third-rate military and political personnel were not allowed to leave. It is also heard that Zhou Fucheng, Pan Yukun, Long Tianwu and other army commanders are all in the Shenyang reception unit. It is heard that the two sides started talking since yesterday afternoon, the representative figures of Shenyang are unknown, but the main purpose is to prevent the people from suffering terribly. The military has been paying off office workers since the 31st. At present, except for the occasional sparse sound of gunfire, the people's uneasy mood is different from the ordinary.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 31st] Shenyang has entered an unusual state of deathly silence. After noon on the 30th, there was no dense sound of gunfire. Except for busy military vehicles at night, there was no disturbance. From the morning to noon on the 31st, everything on the streets was as usual, but the traffic was sparse and many military and civilians were moving. The Shenyang police and municipal government guards are maintaining law and order as usual. People are quite concerned about the sharp drop in prices on the 30th and the surge in prices on the 31st. There is no sound of planes in the clear sky, and most people have changed to a attitude of resignation.</p>
<h3>The National Army on the Pingshi Line is Advancing Smoothly Southward; Crossing Ding County and Approaching Xinle; The Communist Bandits' Attack on the East of the City Was Repelled Again</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 31st] The southward advance of the Pingshi Line is progressing smoothly. The bandits on the south bank of the Tang River have been completely cleared on the 31st and are now approaching the front of Ding County. According to the news from the Army-Air Liaison Group here, the National Army has approached the Xinle Zhengding area, and the Communist bandits in Shijiazhuang are showing signs of shaking.

<h3>U.S. Military Aid to China to Be Shipped Early; High-Ranking Washington Officials Express Deep Concern Over China's Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Well-informed sources recently stated that the first shipment of U.S. military aid to China, originally scheduled to depart in December, has now been moved up to November. The second shipment may be moved up to early December. However, they stated that this matter has not been finalized due to the possibility that a West Coast maritime strike could impede the transportation of materials. They said the supplies will be unloaded in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Dispatch] The U.S. State Department declined to comment on reports in Time magazine regarding the progress of military aid to China. With regard to a public statement issued in early October in the form of a report submitted to Truman, State Department officials stated that no further reports will be forthcoming in the near future. Commentators believe that Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Foreign Aid Committee of Congress and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, dispatched Mr. Bullitt to China at this time of tension, demonstrating Congress's determination to increase aid to China. Following Rep. Judd's statement that he believes aid to China should be increased, Congressional support for this has grown even more active.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch] High-ranking U.S. government officials here today expressed deep concern over the situation in China. At least several of them believe that the setbacks suffered by the Chinese government forces are mainly due to the inadequacy of the U.S. military aid program and the slow pace of shipping materials to China. Other officials, however, severely criticize the Chinese government. One official stated, "The U.S. has been so focused on dealing with affairs in Europe that we have allowed the communists to gain significant ground in the East." Another official stated that unless the U.S. provides more effective assistance with military equipment and advisors, the Nationalist Party will clearly be unable to launch a full-scale offensive against the communists. He continued, saying that President Chiang seems to have decided to shorten the defense lines and adopt a more tenable winter defensive position, so as to preserve strength until next spring. The retreat of government forces actually exacerbates the emergency situation in China and may have a significant impact on the willingness of the next Congress to provide aid to China. He further stated that there is now good reason to expect that President Chiang will reorganize the national army and, after increasing supplies and surviving the winter, will launch an offensive regardless of whether U.S. aid is increased or not.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reflections on Reading the Supplementary Financial and Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>The supplementary new measures for financial and economic reform were passed yesterday in the provisional administrative meeting. The main points are as follows: (1) Restore free trade in grain; (2) Continue to handle grain rationing in the six major cities; (3) The central government will set prices for cotton yarn, cloth, oil, sugar, coal, and salt based on cost accounting and coordinate adjustments. Local governments will set prices and manage other daily necessities and industrial raw materials based on cost accounting; (4) No localities are allowed to prohibit the flow of goods; (5) Public utilities will raise prices; (6) The salaries and wages of public officials and teachers will be adjusted; (7) Commodity taxes and other ad valorem taxes will also be adjusted according to prices. In summary: first, the salaries of public officials and teachers will be adjusted; second, taxes will be increased and public utilities and transportation will raise prices; and third, price controls will be abolished.</p>
<p>Among the above three resolutions, the first item, the issue of salaries for public officials and teachers, was immediately appealed for in this newspaper's editorial at the beginning of the August 19th financial and economic emergency decree. All parties have also pointed out that it is unreasonable and unsustainable. Because using 40 yuan as the base salary resulted in an excessive discount, and the ratio of gold yuan to silver dollars further halved the value in effect. Moreover, black market trading has been rampant for the past 70 days, and price controls have long been in name only. This time, the decision to allow reasonable increases in salaries and wages is undoubtedly a necessary result.</p>
<p>The relevant authorities have repeatedly announced that the second item, raising prices for state-run public utilities and transportation, had already been decided and was inevitable. Even without the drafting of this supplementary plan, it probably would not have been spared. As for raising tax rates, some of it has already been implemented, and now it is reaffirmed. It will certainly be carried out actively in order to make up for the deficit in the national treasury. However, we still hope that the degree of increase at this moment should not be too high, so as not to excessively stimulate prices and affect the value of the gold yuan.</p>
<p>What the public is most concerned about is, of course, the third item, the issue of price controls. In addition to allowing free trade in grain and other commodities, daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cloth, oil, sugar, coal, and salt, and important industrial raw materials, are all subject to cost-based pricing. This means abolishing price controls on the one hand and adopting negotiated pricing on the other. As things stand now, this can only be described as an effective remedy for the current crisis. Just imagine, daily necessities such as firewood, rice, vegetables, etc., all require lining up to buy, and even then, one cannot buy them. If we close our eyes and let this dangerous situation develop naturally, what can we expect for the future? However, there is one point that makes us wary, which is how to implement cost-based pricing. Because the four big characters "cost-based pricing" are easy to say, but not necessarily easy to do. How to do it just right, how to coordinate it comprehensively, its troubles and difficulties are similar to the previous 70 days of price controls. Moreover, it must be reminded that with price controls, materials become less and less; with negotiated prices, prices become higher and higher. At that time, everyone must not come to complain.</p>
<p>Judging from the literal meaning, the so-called cost-based pricing should be another name for negotiated pricing. According to past experience, the result of negotiated pricing is roughly one of two paths: one is that the government does not intervene much, allowing merchants to negotiate and raise prices themselves, which is actually equivalent to letting go; the other is that it is too tight, disregarding how much the cost is, insisting on forcing merchants to lose money, and having many concerns, unable to adjust in time, resulting in black markets, smuggling, and a lack of materials. Therefore, if the purpose of "cost-based pricing" is to eliminate exorbitant profits and maintain legitimate industry and commerce, the technical issue of how to implement it seems worthy of study. We believe that, whether it is at the central or local level, the relevant industry’s impartial people should first propose it themselves, with reasons attached, and report it for approval. When implementing the approval, it must be truly based on cost, publicly assessed, and in addition to the relevant parties being able to send representatives to state their opinions, it is best to have the people's representative body jointly handle it, in order to show fairness. The timeliness of the price negotiation should not be too rigid. Prices should rise and fall according to the actual market supply and demand situation, so as not to become a mere formality and lead to black markets.</p>
<p>In addition to cost-based pricing, the original proposal also contains the term "overall coordination" for cotton yarn, cloth, oil, sugar, coal, and salt under the central government's management, and local governments are also authorized to manage daily necessities and industrial raw materials. Thinking about it in terms of adjusting supply and demand and smoothing out sources, this is certainly reasonable. Moreover, during military operations, transportation is often obstructed, foreign exchange is limited, and there are often concerns about the continuity of raw materials. If the competent officials can help with allocation and find ways to assist, wouldn't that be a good thing? However, it is hoped that these coordination and management agencies will recognize their goals and not shirk responsibility or procrastinate, and especially not have any side effects, so as not to form disguised tax collection agencies, and thus not betray the central government's good intentions to maintain production and improve the economy. Judging from the past situation, it always feels that there is too much meaning of control, restriction, exploitation, and appropriation, and too little practical effect of supporting, encouraging, promoting, and maintaining. Except for factual necessities, it seems better to simply not care, just like price controls. For example, the national cotton joint purchase seems to be a way of "overall coordination" in the eyes of the textile industry, but may I ask what achievements have been made since its implementation? How much cotton has been snapped up? If cotton mills and merchants were encouraged to separately snap up cotton at that time, I am afraid their achievements would be far better than the current situation. The government has done many things wrong several times in the past, but it always refuses to believe it, stubbornly insists on saving face until it is too late to regret it. I sincerely hope that we will not repeat the same mistakes in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, as an aside, today's supplementary measures from the Executive Yuan were originally stipulated in Article 14 of the fourth measure in the August 19th emergency measures decree. The authorities should have been responsible for doing it well within a week or ten days after the decree was promulgated. At that time, black markets for various goods had not yet occurred, and the people's confidence in the gold yuan was strong. Dealing with it at that time would not have caused the market commotion of the past half month, and the common people would not have suffered the hardship of lining up to grab goods or lacking firewood and rice. And now, after taking such a big detour, it cannot but be done according to economic principles. This is truly what is called "being treated as an honored guest after being burnt and exhausted," while the original plan to divert the chimney and remove the firewood was considered alarmist. However, now that the government has decided on supplementary measures, the central authorities in the past, especially the senior officials who designed this "complete set of measures" in the financial authorities, should also have some sense of responsibility seeing the economic crisis of the past two months! Otherwise, even if policies change and society is in turmoil, the good officials will still do what they want. May I ask what the word "responsibility" in the constitutional term "responsible cabinet" means?</p>

<h3>To Resolve the Taiwan Coal Mine Dispute, Chen Qitian Decided on a Plan After Arriving in Taiwan; All Coal Mines in Taipei County Are to Be Privatized</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Taipei, 31st dispatch] The Taiwan coal mine industry has been facing unresolved disputes over the opening up to private operation and the disputes between mine owners and contractors, resulting in serious obstacles to the increase in Taiwan's coal production. This time, Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian and Director of the Mining Department Wang Yebai took the opportunity of coming to Taiwan and have decided on a solution to this problem. Regarding the opening up to private operation, it has been decided to privatize all coal mines in Taipei County that produce coal daily at a price, and the funds will be used to develop the Hsinchu Nanzhuang coalfield as capital for the public coal mine company. Regarding the disputes between mine owners and contractors, three ways of solving the problem are prescribed: (1) Transfer of mining rights, (2) Leasing of equipment to transfer the mining rights to the mine owner, (3) Cooperative operation. The above methods all focus on making the mine owners and contractors get along well. If there are still objections, the government will enforce it compulsorily.</p>
<h3>President Answers Three Questions: A Front-Page Article</h3>
<p>(3) Regarding the questions raised by Mr. Smith concerning "China's importance in the global anti-communist struggle, China's position in another world war, and the potential impact on the global situation should the communist party unfortunately control China," the President responded as follows:</p>
<p>China is striving to suppress communism to eliminate a powerful factor threatening world peace and to prevent the outbreak of a third world war. Therefore, I do not wish to express an opinion on China's potential position in a future world war. However, out of the world's 2.1 billion people, Asia accounts for over 50 percent, and China accounts for more than one-third of Asia's 1.1 billion people. The importance of Asia's position in the world, and China's position in Asia, is self-evident. I would like to point out the following: First, Asian nations, regardless of their political organization, economic life, social foundation, or cultural level, are less advanced than Western nations. Amidst widespread poverty and hunger, communist propaganda and organizational activities are more likely to be effective. Second, the Comintern's traditional strategy of world revolution and its current direction of expansion both target Asia as the primary objective, with China as the decisive point for Asia's future. The communist creed dictates that to control the world, one must first control Asia, and to control Asia, one must first control China. I can assert that if China is controlled by the communist party, a third world war will inevitably erupt, plunging humanity into another tragic disaster. If the Chinese government can eliminate the communist bandits of today, the factors for the next war existing in Asia will be eliminated, and the possibility of a third world war breaking out will also be reduced. The Chinese communist bandits possess armed forces, and their brutality and cunning are unmatched by communist elements in any democratic nation. However, the Chinese government has never abandoned its responsibility to the world and its allies due to the difficulties and damages it has encountered. Regardless of changes in the international environment, China has consistently adhered to international integrity and fulfilled its moral obligations, as it did in the past war against aggression and as it does in today's anti-communist struggle.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the global anti-communist struggle must maintain a unified front. Western Europe and East Asia are equally important. However, Western European countries have advanced industries and higher cultural levels. Nationalism and democratic politics have a history of over 150 years, deeply rooted in the lives and thoughts of the people. Their reliance on American material and moral aid to resist communism is far less urgent than that of Asian nations. If the American people and their politicians truly seek the happiness of mankind, they should start with the world's largest region and the most numerous and suffering people, raising their living and cultural standards and assisting them in achieving independence and freedom. Today, to save the world's people from the disaster of a third world war, it is particularly necessary to save Asia, and the effort to save Asia should focus on China. This is truly an unprecedented and great undertaking in human history, and I hope that the American people and their politicians will take it as their responsibility. (End)</p>

<h3>Entire Galilee Region Under Jewish Army Control; Arab-Jewish Ceasefire Obeyed Yesterday; Security Council Subcommittee Revises and Passes Sino-British Proposal; US-UK Policy on Holy Land Awaits Adjustment</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Haifa, 31st] The Israeli government notified the truce committee here that the Israeli government has ordered the Israeli army on the northern front to implement a ceasefire at 8:00 AM this morning. The head of the United Nations observer corps here requested that the Lebanese government also take the same measures. According to news from the northern front observers, Lebanon had ordered a ceasefire at 4:00 PM on the 30th, but subsequently reopened fire in self-defense.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 31st] Israel announced on the 31st that the Jewish army's lightning offensive in northern Palestine had seized control of the entire Galilee region before the ceasefire deadline expired at 11:00 AM on the 31st. The war lasted only 48 hours, and the Arab irregular forces under Kaukji had already abandoned central Galilee. It is said that white flags can be seen flying everywhere in the area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 30th] On the 30th, the Israeli army launched a joint land and air offensive in northern Palestine, occupying the Arab stronghold of Tayshira (20 miles northeast of Haifa) and continuing to press forward, disregarding the United Nations ceasefire order. Most of the United Nations truce observers have withdrawn to Tiberias, a few miles south of the front line.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The Security Council Subcommittee passed the Sino-British proposal on the Holy Land today. The Ukrainian representative opposed the proposal, and France also attempted to remove the part of the proposal concerning possible economic and diplomatic sanctions, but the other three countries supported it to the end. The Sino-British proposal was finally passed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The Palestinian issue cannot be resolved in the near future because the Security Council is currently taking delaying measures to wait for a clear indication of the trend of the American political situation and for the United Kingdom and the United States to adjust their positions on this matter. Currently, this matter is only being handled by the special subcommittee of the Security Council. After arduous work, the subcommittee has rejected and adopted several proposals and amendments several times and has agreed on a tentative proposal that stipulates: (1) The armies of Egypt and Israel in the Negev region will withdraw to the temporary defense lines drawn by the mediator; (2) Negotiations will continue to begin to delineate precise defense lines; (3) A seven-member committee will be organized to consider whether to take a sanctions plan in accordance with Article 41 of the United Nations Charter for those who disregard the orders of the Security Council. After this proposal is sorted out, it will be submitted to the Security Council for approval. At the same time, according to opinions in the United Nations lounge here, the American delegation will suggest postponing the Palestinian issue until the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York in February or March next year for a final resolution.</p>
<h3>United Nations Work Stalls Before Election of New US President; If Dewey Is Elected, US Foreign Policy Will Not Change</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] Before the United States holds its election on November 2, the United Nations, where work has stalled, believes on the 30th that if Dewey is elected, there will be little fundamental change in American foreign policy. Representatives are inattentive while debating minor issues in the United Nations and are waiting. It is almost impossible for the work of the United Nations to proceed before the United States elects a president. In fact, the representatives of the United Nations are deeply convinced of the reports that Dewey has an advantage over Truman in the presidential election.</p>
<p>However, it is also the first time in American history that a change of president is expected to have little change in foreign policy. According to officials from a Western country, "What we care about is not how American foreign policy will be after January 1 next year, but how American foreign policy will be between November 2 and January once the government changes." In order to dispel doubts about the situation of the American delegation after Dewey is elected, many diplomats here hope that Dewey will issue a statement after the election to clarify Dewey's attitude towards the tasks assigned to the American delegation.</p>
<h3>US Election Situation Broadcast to the Far East; 4,000 Voting Machines to Be Set Up Across the US</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 29th] The "Voice of America" broadcast is scheduled to extensively broadcast the election situation next week and will have a special broadcast specifically for the Far East. The broadcast to the Far East will begin at 10:15 AM (China coast time) on November 3 and will continue until 3:00 PM. After a two-hour break, the regular "Voice of America" broadcast to the Far East will resume at 5:00 PM, maintaining coverage of election news.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chicago, 29th, Associated Press] In the upcoming election in the United States, approximately 4,000 voting machines will be set up across the country. It is reported that under the accelerated work of voting machine manufacturers, there are currently 4,500 such machines available for use.</p>
<h3>South Korea and North Korea Establish Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] The Yugoslav government formally announced today that it has accepted the proposal of the People's Republic of North Korea to establish diplomatic relations and seek to negotiate commercial relations between the two sides. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj has sent a telegram to North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong conveying the South Korean government's decision.</p>
<h3>International Technical Cooperation Should Not Be Excluded</h3>
<p>Britain and the United States Support Argentina's Proposal</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] On the 30th, the United Kingdom and the United States adopted a position that Spain should not be excluded from international cooperation that is "purely technical," such as the economic statistics organization controlled by the United Nations. They argued in the United Nations Legal Committee that the principles of the United Nations' 1946 resolution to boycott Spain should not be applied to technical matters. They supported Argentina's proposal to allow Spain to join the International Economic Statistics Organization. The work of this organization was originally undertaken by the League of Nations and has now been transferred to the United Nations. The Soviet Union and its satellite states, France, and some Latin American countries opposed this proposal, pointing out that this proposal violated the United Nations resolution requiring member states to withdraw their ambassadors to Spain, which also excluded Spain from specific institutions.</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil in Greece; Prime Minister Sophoulis Prepares to Resign; Foreign Minister Tsaldaris May Be Ordered to Form a Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 31st] A political crisis is expected to occur soon in Greece. According to sources from the Liberal Party, Prime Minister Sophoulis will resign after failing to obtain the confidence of a majority of members of parliament when parliament convenes. The person who succeeds in forming a cabinet may still be Sophoulis, but he must make a large number of changes to the cabinet's personnel. According to sources from the People's Party, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris is expected to return to Athens today and may be ordered to form a cabinet because the People's Party is the party that occupies the most seats in parliament.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 31st] The Greek political turmoil was caused by Liberal Party leader Venizelos's announcement that the United Nations' recommendations to Greece were unsatisfactory, making cooperation with the People's Party useless. Venizelos has divided the Liberal Party, so Sophoulis is expected to form a coalition government with the opposition in response.</p>
<h3>It May Be Difficult to Resolve the Greek Issue in the United Nations General Assembly for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The United Nations Political Committee is currently discussing the Greek issue. Although the majority of committee members advocate voting on the proposals put forward by China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, which advocate expanding the powers of the Balkan Investigation Committee and asking Greece's northern neighbors not to interfere in its internal affairs, it may still be difficult to resolve the issue for the time being. It is reported that the Soviet bloc has put forward a counter-proposal, advocating that Greece and its neighbors restore diplomatic relations and withdraw American troops stationed in Greece.</p>
<h3>Japanese Diet Will Not Dissolve Until Civil Service Bill Is Passed; Yoshida Argues in Cadre Meeting</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida convened the Cabinet Secretary-General and senior cadres of the party again on the evening of the 30th to discuss the issue of whether to dissolve the Diet immediately. Yoshida still insisted that after the Diet passes important bills such as the revised Civil Service Bill, he would decide whether to dissolve based on the situation. When the Liberal Party was in opposition, it had requested the Ashida Cabinet to convene an extraordinary Diet session for these bills. At this time, it would be theoretically contradictory for the Liberal Party to be in power and dissolve the Diet without waiting for this bill to be passed. As for the situation in the Diet's discussion of various bills, although it is currently impossible to have a firm grasp of victory, even if an unfavorable situation occurs and it becomes necessary to dissolve the Diet, it is also what the Liberal Party had expected when it was in opposition. The result was unanimous support for Yoshida's opinion.</p>
<h3>East Germany Forms Police Army; Soviet Plan Obstructed</h3>
<p>Germans Flee to Western Occupation Zones</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 31st] A senior official of the US military government said that the Soviet Union had planned to establish a military "People's Police Army" in East Germany, but the plan was severely delayed due to the mass desertion of recruits. It was also said that the Soviet Union had wanted to establish an East German state, but the number of police officers fleeing to the West was increasing, and the German leaders appointed by the Soviet Union were also becoming increasingly wary of the Soviet side, so the establishment of the new country may also be shelved.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 31st] TASS News Agency, Berlin, reports that the Soviet Union has recently recruited 10,000 more policemen in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, but firmly denies the British and American reports that the Soviet Union's actual strength is between one and one hundred and thirty thousand people.</p>

<p>To Combat Landlords Demanding Huge Key Money</p>

<h3>Seven-Nation Anti-Communist Alliance Treaty Being Drafted; Considering Expanding the Scope; Will Be Rapidly Unveiled After US Election</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Western diplomatic sources say that when seven Western nations plan to conclude the North Atlantic Mutual Defense Treaty, they intend to expand the scope of the alliance to cope with any acts of aggression in any corner of the world that affect their security. People involved in drafting the military alliance treaty say that the alliance will include situations in which the homelands, territories, and borders of the seven nations around the world are attacked. In addition, according to current plans, the treaty will stipulate that if world peace is threatened, the seven nations should act together to deter aggression. Detailed plans for this peacetime anti-communist alliance will be rapidly unveiled after the US Department of Defense and the State Department consult with the next president. The preliminary work on this plan has in fact been suspended, pending the president's review and decision on the procedures for the United States to participate in cooperation. US officials predict that the United States will participate in the North Atlantic Treaty as a contracting party and will provide Western European Allied nations with supplementary weapons until their own strength is sufficient to resist aggression from any direction. Authoritative sources say that the current plan includes the following broad points: (1) If any of the seven countries and the non-communist countries that subsequently join are subject to armed aggression, each country should consider it an aggression against all contracting parties, and each country should immediately decide on the steps to be taken and consult to determine collective action. (2) The areas protected by the mutual defense alliance should be specified in detail with latitude and longitude. (3) If the territories of the major contracting powers outside the above-mentioned areas are attacked, the Standing Defense Bureau should immediately discuss it. If sovereignty and political independence are threatened, the Standing Defense Organization should consider the steps that each country should take immediately. Officials hope that the alliance will include Portugal, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and other Western European countries.</p>

<h3>Authorities Confer on Adjusting Prices and Wages; Strictly Prohibit Arbitrary Interference or Obstruction of Commodity Circulation; Will No Longer Interfere in the Buying and Selling of Vegetables, Fish, and Meat</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 5:00 PM yesterday (the 31st), Supervisors Yu Hongjun and Jiang Jingguo invited Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director Wu Kaixian, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Vice President Liu Gongyun, Director of the Central Trust Bureau Lin Chongyong, and Section Chief Li Lixia to confer at 1182 Yuyuan Road on the reasonable adjustment of prices and wages in the city after the central government announced supplementary plans for financial and economic reform. First, the two supervisors and Vice President Liu reported on the process of the central government discussing and deciding on supplementary measures, and then exchanged views. It was generally agreed that since the central government had decided to continue rationing household rice as usual, food could be bought and sold at market prices, and the central government would set prices for cotton cloth, sugar, coal, and salt based on cost, other daily necessities and industrial raw materials should also be managed based on the principle of cost-based pricing, so that commodities can be freely exchanged between regions, and their prices can be expected to reach a reasonable natural level. The first step must be to strictly prohibit arbitrary interference and obstruction of transportation. All vegetables, fish, and meat in the small vegetable markets will also be changed to a non-interference method, so as to encourage them to be supplied as much as possible, and prices can be expected to gradually stabilize, at least to ensure that there are goods on the market. However, the black market for gold and banknotes and speculative hoarding should still be strictly prohibited. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>

<h3>Special Household Registration: Investigation and Issuance of Certificates Procedures</h3>
<p>As the city's general household registration check is imminent, the procedures for investigating and issuing certificates for special household registrations, such as military personnel and waterborne residents, have been jointly discussed and decided by the responsible persons of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Ninth Regiment of the Military Police, and the Police Bureau: (1) Special household registration investigation teams will be established according to the types of special household registrations, each team consisting of one member from the military, police, military police, and security forces, as a general principle. (2) To ensure accuracy, except for waterborne households, all military agencies, resident troop officers, hotel guests who have not been photographed and received certificates, or vagrant populations on the streets, will be subject to pre-investigation three days before the investigation by personnel specially assigned by the special household registration investigation team, issuing blank new National Identification Cards, which will be filled, stamped, and issued on the investigation day. (3) The method of issuing certificates to officers and soldiers of resident troops is as follows: In accordance with the resolution of the household registration investigation meeting convened by the mayor on October 26, identity cards will not be issued to officers and soldiers of resident troops; their ration purchase certificates will be reported to higher authorities separately for instructions; certificates will be issued to officers, but if any officers or soldiers have dependents living separately in Taishi, certificates will be issued in accordance with general ordinary household registrations. The division between military agencies and resident troops will be investigated and listed by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, including the names and addresses of each unit and the number of officers and soldiers, and submitted to the meeting before November 3.</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of new National Identification Cards to hotel guests, the Hotel Industry Association has strongly opposed it, fearing that once guests obtain identity cards, they can use them to prove their right to reside there permanently. After discussion by the Civil Affairs Bureau and relevant parties, two methods have been decided: (1) Certificates will be issued to those who have applied for household registration before September 31 and are still residing in hotels; others will not be issued. (2) Guests who have resided in the city's hotels for a long time must not use the identity cards obtained by reporting their household registration as a basis for obtaining housing lease rights. In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Council for public announcement, the court will also be asked to investigate.</p>

<h3>Most of the Remaining Supplies are Moldy; Buyers are Losing Out</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] The canned food distributed to public school teachers by the Materials Supply Bureau is mostly moldy and inedible. Yesterday morning, the reporter went to Yu Yongxing at No. 954 Shaanxi South Road and Yonglong Company at No. 1318 Linsen Middle Road to inspect the actual situation. He saw only a few hundred cans of impractical canned food in the display windows, and most of the rest were toilet paper, military kettles, envelopes, stationery, and other items. At that time, the reporter tried to buy two cans of evaporated milk in each place, and later found that the liquid in the cans had long solidified into hard lumps. Most people wasted time and money, and what they got was inedible, resulting in considerable losses, and they all resented it.</p>

<h3>Last Day to Exchange Gold Banknotes; Very Few People Come to Exchange</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] Yesterday was the last day to exchange gold banknotes. Although the Central Bank was on a weekly holiday, it was still open for business as usual. However, very few people came to exchange gold banknotes. Although the exact figures have not been finalized, according to the person in charge of the exchange work: only about ten transactions of gold and US dollars were exchanged throughout the day. Therefore, the Central Bank still closed at 4:00 pm as originally scheduled. After 4:00 pm, there was no one left in the counters. As for the exchange requests from various cities outside of the Central Bank's branches, they will be based on the postmark on the letter, it is said.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Private Hoarding Starts Today</h3>

<h3>Tragedy in Front of a Butcher Shop at the Intersection of Yong'an Street, Nanshi; Woman Shot and Killed While Buying Pork; Squad Leader of the Kanjian Team Causes Trouble, to be Handled; Bereaved Family Makes Three Requests; Two Supervising Team Leaders Punished</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] At about 10:30 am yesterday, a tragic incident occurred in front of the Lugaoxian butcher shop at the intersection of Yong'an Street (Catholic Church Road), Sichuan South Road, where a woman was shot and killed due to the crowd buying pork. The murderer was Gu Hanming, the squad leader of the Kanjian Brigade. He was transferred to the brigade headquarters by the Huangpu Police Branch for investigation by the Garrison Command. It is reported that Zhu Li (39 years old), who lived in a pavilion room at No. 54 Dechang Lane, Jinling East Road, brought her daughter Zhu Xuelian (18 years old) to line up in front of Lugaoxian in the early morning to buy meat. Because Zhu Xuelian was interfered with by Gu Hanming, the two sides had a conflict, which angered Gu, who raised his gun and fired. Zhu's mother stepped forward to rescue her from the queue and fell to the ground in response. The bullet entered from the left breast in front of the chest and exited from the back. She died before she could be rescued. Order was disrupted for a time. Afterwards, the Huangpu Branch reported the incident and sent personnel to the bureau to bring Gu Hanming for interrogation. Gu admitted to the shooting but did not intend to shoot her. Later, Gu was transferred to the brigade headquarters and then to the Garrison Command for verification. It is reported that the deceased had five children, the youngest of whom was only a few months old, and the family was in great distress.</p>
<p>[Another News] After Zhu Li was shot and killed, the deceased's husband, Zhu Qingyun, made three requests to the Kanjian Brigade: (1) Punish Gu Hanming, (2) Assist the bereaved family in handling the aftermath, (3) Subsidize the education expenses of the children. Deputy Brigade Commander Chen Zhijing gave a satisfactory reply. Brigade Commander Wang Sheng expressed his regret that the squad leader Gu Hanming injured someone with a gun while on duty. In addition to sending Gu to the Garrison Command for investigation, he also dismissed the squadron leader Xia Tianyi and demoted the brigade commander Zhong Yijun, but allowed him to remain in his post, and requested punishment himself.</p>
<p>In addition, Supervisor Jiang Jingguo had just flown back to Shanghai and immediately heard the news. He immediately telegraphed Brigade Commander Wang and instructed him to send someone to represent him in comforting the family of the deceased.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Gentleman Chen Huayu Passes Away; Funeral to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chen Weiyu, a veteran gentleman from Pinghu, Zhejiang, passed away at his residence in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 30th of last month at the age of 82. The funeral will be held at the Chinese Funeral Home on Huashan Road at 2 pm tomorrow. According to his will, no obituary will be issued and no mourning hall will be set up. He was a famous staff member of the late Qing Dynasty and was repeatedly invited by the Northern Warlords government with great respect. Later, he served as a magistrate in Fujian Province and was known for his strong orders. He rose to the position of prefect with outstanding reputation. After the Republic of China, the financial authorities again relied on him and repeatedly served as the director of the salt, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. Later, he was transferred to Jiangxi Province to deal with anti-smuggling affairs. Because he could not eliminate long-standing malpractices, he resigned in anger (in 1924). Since then, he closed his doors and swept the streets. Although he sometimes made a living by selling paintings and pawning clothes, he still strictly implemented the Yan family precepts and supervised his children. Therefore, his son Ju Lai, Tong Zhao, and Zuo Gaodeng, etc., were accustomed to tasting porridge, encouraging each other with integrity, and relying on printing and art galleries to provide for their parents in recent years. The integrity of the Chen brothers is said to be based on the old man's legacy, and everyone deeply feels the decline of the old gentry. It can be imagined that on the day of the funeral, plain cars and white horses will be extremely grand for a time.</p>
<h3>Dispersing Refugees to Jiangxi for Reclamation; Yuan Wenzhang Returns After Survey; First Batch of Over 3,000 People Sent</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] Yuan Wenzhang, the chief secretary of the Shanghai Relief Committee and the fourth section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to Jiangxi to discuss everything related to dispersing refugees from the city to Jiangxi for reclamation, and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The first batch of migrants in this city will be 3,500 people, requiring 2 million yuan. Once the funds are available, registration and repatriation will be carried out.</p>
<p>Director Yuan went to Nanchang on this trip to meet with the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and went to Zhanggongdu, Yongxiu, to conduct an on-site survey of the established reclamation sites. According to the survey: Jiangxi Province currently has a total of 614,400 mu of arable wasteland. Calculating at 20 mu per household, the counties in the province can accommodate about 30,000 reclamation households. If reclamation is to be carried out by the province, it is best to choose a site to establish a reclamation site. However, because Jiangxi Province has no funds for administrative and business expenses related to reclamation, it can only arrange resettlement in the 28 reclamation sites originally established in De'an, Yongxiu, Anfu, Jishui, Taihe, Wan'an, Le'an, Chongren, Nanyan, Guangchang, Lichuan, Zixi, Dexing and other counties, estimating that it can accommodate 1,100 reclamation households, about 3,500 people. Most of the reclamation sites in Yongxiu and other places were established during the Xingzong period. Among them, Zhanggongdu currently has 92 reclamation households with a total of 154 people, most of whom are refugees from Henan. Each household is currently allocated more than 10 mu for seasonal planting, and they also raise pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. There is a primary school in the town where the children of the reclamation households can go to school. When Director Yuan went to conduct the survey, it was the harvest season. Each household had more than 10 dan of rice in storage, and they were self-sufficient and lived a stable life.</p>
<p>The first batch of 3,500 people planned to be resettled in this city included the allocation of ten months of rations, the construction of a thatched cottage for each household, one ox and one set of large farm tools for every three households, and one set of small farm tools and essential furniture for each household, totaling 180,000 gold yuan when the resettlement budget was prepared in July. Today, it requires 2 million yuan.</p>

<h3>More Than Half of the October Rice Ration Has Been Distributed; More Than 210,000 Shi Still Awaiting Purchase, Storage, and Shipment to Shanghai</h3>
<p>In recent days, due to the difficulty for citizens to purchase rice, the reporter especially visited the Civil Affairs Committee yesterday to inquire about the reasons. According to Jun Yiyi, a member of the news team: the current source of grain is supplied by the Grain Department's Purchase and Storage Committee, but due to transportation difficulties and the urgent needs of citizens, all the rice that is transported to the committee is immediately transported to rice stores for distribution without entering the warehouse. The total amount of rice distributed in Shanghai each month is 527,788 shi. From October 16 to the end of October, the committee has done its best to distribute 312,506 shi in 15 days, including 97,706 shi allocated by the Purchase and Storage Committee, 1,080 shi from the Tianliang Department, 128,270 shi of whole and broken rice from the committee's inventory from the previous month, and 6,974 shi of rice that the committee raised and stored in warehouses. In addition, the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China has kindly assisted with 78,476 shi after clearing the first and second phases of rice distribution, accounting for more than half of the amount of rice to be distributed in October. There is still 115,282 shi that has not been allocated. It was originally scheduled to end the distribution on November 10. If the Purchase and Storage Committee can ship it to Shanghai earlier, it will be able to allocate and clear it earlier.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Coins: Silver Coins and Copper Coins Each Have More Than a Thousand Varieties; Both Have Historical and Cultural Value; Only a Few People in China are Known for Studying and Collecting Them</h3>
<p>[Special Feature] The collection and research of coins is not as common in China as the hobby of stamp collecting, but coin collecting and stamp collecting both have historical and cultural value. Coin displays can be found in museums in various countries around the world, with extremely rich collections. Taking the United States as an example, it is said that there are more than 100,000 coin enthusiasts and collectors, and major cities have coin society organizations, while there are only four or five relatively well-known coin collectors in China.</p>
<p>Among Chinese coins, in addition to banknotes, the hard coins that have collection value are only two major types: silver and copper. Silver coins are divided into Yuan head, Sun head, Ship Ocean, and Dragon Ocean, while copper coins are divided into Guangxu Yuanbao, Daqing Copper Coin, and Double Flag Copper Yuan. In the eyes of ordinary people, all hard coins do not go beyond these categories, what is so precious to talk about? But in the eyes of collectors, there are more than a thousand kinds of treasures. Whether silver coins or copper coins, either the manufacturing region is different, or only a few exist, or the patterns are different, or there are errors in the printing plate, or they have commemorative value, as long as there is a slight difference, they are all the targets of their hunt and regarded as valuable treasures. Even many types of differences are only a slight difference in the micro-fine patterns, which can only be seen with a microscope. Therefore, in the words of collectors, there are at least more than a thousand kinds of silver coins and copper coins.</p>
<p>The Earliest Silver Dollar Was Cast in Guangdong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhang Huang, a coin researcher and collector in Shanghai, and saw many rare treasures from him.</p>
<p>The earliest silver dollar in China was officially cast in Guangdong in the thirteenth year of Guangxu. At that time, the weight was seven qian and three fen per coin, with the purpose of resisting the Mexican silver coin of seven qian and two fen. Unexpectedly, it was not long before it was specialized in melting it for sale as pure silver because of its heavier silver content for profit. After that, the seven qian and two fen coin was recast, and there were also changes in the pattern. Initially, the inner circle on the front was Guangxu Yuanbao, and the outer circle was written in foreign languages such as "Guangdong Province Made Seven Qian Three Fen", and the reverse was a dragon and Chinese characters such as "Guangdong Province Made, Seven Qian Three Fen". After this silver dollar was made, the Qing court was very unhappy because the pattern on the front was no different from symbolizing that Emperor Guangxu was surrounded by foreigners. Therefore, an order was issued to recast it, moving the foreign languages to the reverse and moving the Chinese characters on the reverse to the outer circle of the front, which is the form that has been circulating since then. The original style is called the reverse version, which is now very rare.</p>
<p>One Coin is Worth More Than 1,000 Gold Yuan</p>
<p>When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he made the Hongxian Flying Dragon Coin. The front was a portrait of Yuan Shikai, and the reverse was a winged dragon and the words "Chinese Empire, Hongxian Era". It is extremely rare and special, but this treasure is not as famous as the Longyang made in Hubei Province, because the words "Ben Sheng" (this province) are listed next to the dragon on the back of the Longyang, which is a rare product among millions. At that time, it was said to be worth more than 1,000 gold yuan, which is truly incomprehensible to those outside the circle.</p>
<p>Yuan head and Sun head coins should be extremely common, but not entirely. For example, there is a Sun coin with the English BIRTH on the back mistaken for RIBIH, and there are the two characters Gansu next to a Yuan head, which has become a treasure again.</p>
<p>The Nine-Star Flag Ten Wen is the Most Valuable Copper Coin</p>
<p>The most valuable copper coin is the Nine-Star Flag Ten Wen made in Anhui Province, followed by the Jiangxi Xinhai Dahan Ten Wen and the Guangxi Guangxu Yuanbao Ten Wen. Before the war, in 1935, Ji Jun once bought a Jiangxi Xinhai Dahan Ten Wen for 1,200 yuan, which shows the rarity of the rest. The most novel style is the Harbin One Fen coin, the pattern of which is a warship, meaning to build the navy. Only two of these have been seen to date. The face value of ordinary copper yuan should be ten wen and twenty wen. The largest face value is the Henan Double Flag, when five hundred wen, and the special face value is the Sichuan Dang Thirty Copper Yuan. When Hongxian proclaimed himself emperor, he also started to make copper coins. Before proclaiming himself emperor, the Wuchang Mint had already trial-produced two types of Yuan coin ten wen copper coins, which were not circulated. Especially one with a large face has less than ten pieces handed down to the world. Other portrait copper coins include Sun Yat-sen, Xu Shichang, and Tang Jiyao, all of which are extremely rare. When Zhu Zheyuan was in power in North China in 1936, he trial-produced 20 types of Pingjin copper yuan. Currently, only Ma Dingxiang has a complete set in China, which he cherishes very much.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the copper yuan that was looted by the Japanese was very large in number. Recently, they have been returned one after another. Among them, there may be many great treasures. Since the implementation of the new currency system, the Central Bank has exchanged more than 6 million silver coins. There must be extremely valuable products in such a large number. It would be a great pity if they were all melted and remade into new coins. Collectors hope that the government can appoint experts to select the treasures among them and send them to museums throughout the country for display. This will preserve historical relics for the country, and the people will have the opportunity to appreciate and study them.</p>
<h3>Collectors Hope that Ancient Coins Should Be Preserved</h3>
<p>The matter that coin collectors have been worried about recently is that since the reform of the currency system, the government has not issued a clear order allowing the possession of rare ancient coins. If they are also required to be exchanged like ordinary gold and silver, then the loss of antiques is extremely regrettable. If they are still held, they are afraid of violating the law. Therefore, the Chinese Numismatic Society has submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Central Bank, requesting that it be clearly allowed to continue holding them. They believe that the scarcity of coins and whether they have collection value can be identified by experts and coin books for reference, so that people will not use the name of collectors as an excuse to hoard for profit. However, the government has not yet expressed any opinion on this request, it is said.</p>

<h3>Providing Clues to Rob the Neighbor's House; Three Criminals Each Sentenced to Seven Years</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] Guo Kailai, who lived next to Ma Jinghuan and was familiar with her family's situation, provided clues to Zhang Jinbiao and Xu Zhongjian to conspire to rob Ma's house. At 3:00 pm on August 23 of this year, Zhang and Xu went to Ma's house at No. 4 Dening Lane, Tiantong Road, pried open the back door, and broke into the house. Zhang threatened with a pistol and robbed Ma's family of clothes, gold rings, and other items together with Xu. Later, after Ma reported the crime to the police, the police found out the truth and arrested the criminals one by one, and seized the pistol and bullets. Later, some of the stolen goods were found in Zhang's and Xu's possession. After verifying that it was true, they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The District Court sentenced Zhang Jinbiao and Xu Zhongjian to seven years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of political rights for taking other people's property with violence and coercion for their own illegal possession. Guo Kailai was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of political rights for helping others to take other people's property with violence and coercion for their own illegal possession. The rest of the case was not accepted. One pistol, four bullets, and one magazine were confiscated.</p>

<h3>General Commodity Prices: Price-Controlled Transactions Cannot Proceed, Barter Emerges in Response</h3>
<p>Last week, the central authorities held several important meetings to review the current economic problems, with whether or not to continue maintaining price controls being the focus of the debate. Under this atmosphere in the market, and because the end of October was approaching, rumors spread that price controls would be adjusted starting in November. Generally, people, whether buying or selling, further increased their wait-and-see attitude, and transactions complying with the "August 19th" price controls almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the black market, rumors of surging prices were rampant. It is said that some items have exceeded the original price by more than ten times. Credit is tight, and black market interest rates are high. Due to the activities of various black markets, nearly 500 million yuan of floating capital has been drawn into this vortex. Purchasing even small items is extremely difficult. Taking a simple family as an example, items such as rice, oil, and sugar all require queuing to purchase, and the quantities are extremely limited. People have to wait for several hours, and those who are late risk going home empty-handed. Whether the price control policy is correct has not yet been definitively concluded, but judging from the current situation, it has indeed caused great inconvenience to the lives of most people, and it is necessary to quickly seek improvements based on the facts.</p>
<p>Given the aforementioned situation, as price-controlled transactions cannot proceed, barter has emerged in response and is popular for a time. The most significant examples are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Yang Chuo'an, director of the Food Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food, stated that after discussing with relevant central agencies the problem of allocating food supplies to the six major cities in November, the planning of allocating food supplies is now facing two difficulties due to price controls. One is that materials cannot be exchanged between rural and urban areas, causing prices in production areas to be higher than market prices. The second is that various production areas prohibit food from leaving their boundaries. After consultations with various parties, the above difficulties can be said to have been resolved. In response to the first difficulty, the Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee decided to exchange yarn and cloth for food. The Central Bank has allocated 6,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 60,000 bolts of cotton cloth, which have been inspected and received by the Emergency Committee. This batch of yarn and cloth will be used to exchange for 30-40% of the allocated grain for November, which is expected to yield 500,000 *shi* (a unit of dry measure) of rice and 500,000 *shi* of wheat.</p>
<p>(2) The National Cotton United Purchasing Committee decided: (1) To use one piece of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard to exchange for the cotton needed for two pieces of 20-count cotton yarn, with the shortfall paid in Gold Yuan Certificates. (2) To encourage cotton farmers and promote the smooth progress of purchasing work, if the amount paid in Gold Yuan Certificates exceeds the prescribed method, a certain amount of bonus will be issued depending on the circumstances. (3) The Central Bank has previously agreed to allocate 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn first, which can be picked up today and transported to cotton-producing areas to purchase domestic cotton. If the cotton yarn is insufficient in the future, the Central Bank can allocate the original total amount of cotton yarn and the portion of cotton yarn for domestic sales from the U.S. aid cotton yarn and cloth joint venture to exchange for cotton. (4) Cotton merchants in this city who have cotton can also exchange it according to the above exchange method and ratio.</p>
<p>(3) The Wuxi Materials Adjustment Committee decided that the first batch of 20,000 bags of flour that can be supplied to Shanghai will be shipped immediately. Wuxi needs Shanghai to supply the following materials: 12,000 *dan* (a unit of weight) of sugar, 3,500 boxes of soap, 25 million cigarettes, 400 boxes of matches, more than 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn, and 60,000 bolts of cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy two months ago, leading to the extremely abnormal economic situation at present, the authorities have, after days of discussion, formulated a plan of relevant economic measures to remedy the situation. The plan was carried to Beiping by Li Weiguo, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, last Friday to be submitted to the President for approval. In addition, relevant agencies and concerned people are also making appeals regarding the current economic situation.</p>
<p>(1) The Economic Resources, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee, the Finance and Food Committee, and the Interior and Land Administration Committee of the Control Yuan held a joint meeting on the 26th to review the current economic situation. The meeting listed facts such as currency inflation, production reduction, cargo pileup, loose credit, and high black market prices, and submitted a correction proposal to the Executive Yuan, urging it to quickly seek effective measures to stop this serious phenomenon.</p>
<p>(2) The Legislative Yuan held its 15th meeting on the 29th. Legislator Chen Mingxian proposed a temporary emergency motion: "Please propose methods to urgently rescue the current economic crisis, and request the government to implement them." The emergency measures proposed by Chen were: (1) Levy capital from wealthy families. (2) Levy materials stockpiled by large households. (3) Use the gold, silver, and foreign exchange collected by the Gold Yuan Certificates to purchase raw materials for daily necessities. (4) Purchase materials from areas occupied by the Communist bandits at high prices. (5) Implement full rationing, starting with major cities. (6) Ration raw materials to factories. (7) Provide large-scale agricultural loans. (8) Remove price controls on daily necessities. (9) Adjust prices of state-owned enterprises. (10) Pay public and educational personnel according to the price index.</p>
<p>(3) Zhu Guangji and 16 other professors from various universities in Beiping jointly drafted a lengthy "Plea for the People: Relieve Man-Made Suffering and Injustice," and asked President Hu Shi to forward it to the President and Premier Weng. The document pointed out that the reasons for rising prices are: "Although rising prices are mainly due to currency inflation, reduced production, lack of materials, reduced area of currency circulation, and the psychological impact of war and unrest can all similarly cause prices to rise." The demands to the government are: "(1) The success limit of the Gold Yuan Certificate is that the government can implement rationing of major necessities of life according to the August 19th price controls. (2) The government should increase taxes on public utilities to make reasonable price increases and raise funds to subsidize rationing expenses. (3) All other price controls should be lifted, and there is no need to negotiate prices. Maintain a free market so that economic activity does not stagnate and does not affect the basic lives of ordinary people."</p>
<h3>Monetary Finance: Tight Credit Shifts to High Black Market Interest Rates, Creating a New Record After Currency Reform</h3>
<p>Last week, the tightness of credit in this city can be said to have reached a climax, which is very similar to the phenomenon of alternating loosening and tightening of credit in the era of legal tender. Although there are many reasons for this, in essence, it is nothing more than the inevitable result of malignant currency inflation. Looking forward and backward, one cannot help but feel a thousand emotions!</p>
<p>As last week approached the end of the month, the market's need for funds may have been more urgent than usual. As for the brewing new controlled economy plan, the general view is that it must be relaxed, so there were more people searching for funds, as if as long as they could borrow money and purchase some materials, it would always be cheaper in the not-too-distant future. Speaking of the suppliers of funds, of course, they have the same mentality, so the imbalance between supply and demand of funds caused the gradual rise of black market interest rates, which are comparable to market interest rates before the currency reform. From this, it is not difficult to predict that the financial situation, which has been quiet for more than two months, will return to an extremely serious stage.</p>
<p>Another main reason for the shift of credit to tightness is the large outflow and southward flow of floating capital. The inflow of floating capital into the countryside is indeed to seek a way out in the cracks of control. The large southward flow of floating capital can also preserve its value after being converted into Hong Kong dollars or other currencies. It is estimated that the total amount of capital flowing south in recent days has reached 5 million Gold Yuan, and some even say that it reaches about 2.5 million yuan per day. The southward flow of capital and the tightness of credit are actually a replay of the old tune before the "August 19th" currency reform.</p>
<p>Although there are no accurate figures to be found for the exchange difference of national banks last week, reports say that due to the handling of remittances to other places and the collection of payments for allocated sugar and cloth, there was a considerable surplus, which naturally fueled the wave of tightness. Foreign banks also had a considerable surplus over the week, which was generally related to the southward flow of capital.</p>
<p>One of the results of tight credit is high black market interest rates. On Monday of last week, the market interest rate had already exceeded 20%. By Wednesday, it had reached 30%. On Thursday and Friday, there were quite a few daily loans made at 15-16 yuan, which is equivalent to an interest rate of 45%, which has not been seen since the currency reform.</p>
<p>Commercial banks and stores are generally short of cash, so some of them are replenishing their cash from outside the industry, and borrowing between industries is becoming more prosperous. On Monday, banks limited cash withdrawals for customers to around 500 yuan. If the amount exceeded the limit, they would issue promissory notes, and the scene of promissory notes flooding the streets before the currency reform is now vividly remembered.</p>
<p>Last week, remittances to Taiwan and Guangdong were restricted, so many people used the method of transporting cash, and cash funds became unusually tight. Discounts on larger denominations of cash were seen repeatedly, reportedly between 0.4% and 0.8%. Cash shortages often occur at the same time as tight credit.</p>
<p>Although there was no major change in the exchange rate within the week, the black market exchange rate soared sharply, especially in Hankou and Chongqing. According to reports, each thousand yuan was around 50 yuan. The daily interest rate in Chongqing has reached 25 yuan, so funds were transferred back to Chongqing to be lent out. In Hankou, it was due to the relationship between the southward flow of funds to escape to Hong Kong, which created the highest black market exchange rate since the currency reform.

<h3>After Traveling Across the Country on Foot for 17 Years, Dong Shuhua Arrives in Taipei</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 31st] The young traveler Dong Shuhua set off from Guangdong on September 1, 1931, determined to travel across the country and the South Seas Islands on foot. Today, he completed his journey, which lasted 17 years and one month, and covered 102,000 li (a Chinese unit of distance), setting a record for walking distance in our country. During the three years from the victory of the War of Resistance to the present, he has traveled in the southwest and northeast border areas. He visited Taiwan last year, and his footprints have covered all counties and cities on the island and nearby small islands. He has recently returned to Taipei to visit the Taiwan Provincial Exposition and will take a boat to Hong Kong in a few days. From Hong Kong, he will transfer to India to pay homage to Buddhism and will then begin his planned world travel plan, which is expected to take 13 years to complete.</p>

<h3>Cars, Suits, Kitchens</h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>— All moral doctrines, if incompatible with the system of social life, are powerless. — Kropotkin</p>
<p>Diligence and thrift have always been regarded as virtues, but their limits should vary according to different environments and times. If one must rigidly adhere to the old ways and follow the ancients step by step, then the so-called virtue expressed is only a proof of one's lack of progress, or at least the lack of progress in the art of living.</p>
<p>For example, "working at sunrise and resting at sunset" is the diligence of the ancients, but now we should at least have some considerable entertainment to adjust ourselves in addition to "working and resting"; "a basket of food and a gourd of drink" is the thrift of the ancients, but now we should pay more attention to nutritional intake in addition to using food as a tool to fill our stomachs. This is not excessive, it is necessary; it is not wasteful, it is correct. Because the current era and environment are different from those of the ancients, human beings should progress with the progress of the times, otherwise, they will be backward and ignore reality.</p>
<p>Saying this is not opposing diligence and thrift, let alone advocating laziness and extravagance. Rather, it is to say that diligence and thrift should have their appropriate limits. Otherwise, if one works 24 hours a day, diligence is indeed achieved, but what is the efficiency of the work? If one eats only coarse rice for three meals a day, thrift is indeed achieved, but what is the degree of nutrition?</p>
<p>As long as you think about the times, the national essence experts do not have to constantly sigh that today's people are not as good as the ancients.</p>
<p>Since the authorities advocated frugality, the response has been truly overwhelming. This shows that the people's hearts are not dead, and the country can be saved. Of course, in today's difficult times, all citizens have the need to cut back on clothing and food to help the military and work hard to increase production. However, what the authorities have shown us is to eliminate unnecessary waste, not to abolish legitimate needs. The provisions are there, and they can be carefully studied. However, some responders often overcorrect, making things difficult for others, which makes me suspect that they are only making verbal announcements.</p>
<p>Now let's give an example of overcorrection:</p>
<p>"Cheng ××, a celebrity in Guangzhou, initiated the construction of a frugal new village, stipulating that residents of the village: 1. Are not allowed to privately own cars; 2. Are not allowed to set up private kitchens; 3. Are not allowed to wear Western-style clothes and leather shoes." (See this newspaper on the 20th of this month)</p>
<p>Whether people with their own cars will join the village is another matter. Just from the car itself, it is very questionable whether it is necessarily extravagant. I think if you are not an idiot, you should understand the difference between taking a car to handle important matters and taking a car to dance or play cards. Is it true that people who take cars should not be thrifty, cannot be thrifty, or do not want to be thrifty? This is the first point.</p>
<p>"No private kitchens" is even more forcing different families to live their own ideal lives. In short, it is forcing people to do things that are difficult for them. May I ask: Since it is neither a group nor a troop, why must they eat "communal meals"? This is the second point.</p>
<p>Western-style clothes, which are also called "Hu clothes" by national essence experts, and leather shoes, I boldly inherit the teachings of the "masters" and tentatively name them "Yi abdomens," which I feel is more righteous and stern than the words "leather shoes." But what kind of clothes are long gowns and mandarin jackets? Today's shoes are also very different from those of the ancients. Why is the former necessarily extravagant, while the latter is in line with thrift? This is the third point.</p>
<p>Diligence and thrift must be practiced equally, which shows that there should be no distinction between self and others. However, it is necessary to make three chapters of the law, tighten the face, and do not blame the shallowness of me and others for being unpredictable.</p>
<p>This passage is not directed solely at Cheng in Guangzhou, and his enthusiasm is also worthy of admiration. Our main goal is to hope that the virtuous people who have the ability to issue calls should have a plan, and should come up with a practical plan; if you want to do work, you should come up with a feasible work. Do not ignore reality, entangle the wrong era, and look to the heavens and the earth to make lofty and unattainable grand theories. I am sincerely afraid and look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road</p>
<p>In a special car, the wheels are busy turning, it is better to move the winning disease with strict precautions, the sky is across the tourists without feelings, the rice is ripe and the clouds of Wu reach the sea and turn yellow; entering the market, there is a noisy sound of overturned cauldrons at dawn, and the dust moves the dry mulberry trees, do not use mulberry and hemp as strings and bows, shooting ducks and hitting chickens alarms the four directions.</p>
<p>Borrowing a Couch Under the Qingbo Bridge, One Gains the Interest of Surrounding Green and White, and is Very Grateful to an Old Friend</p>
<p>The window captures Qingbo and a wide field of Yang, evening bells and morning birds emerge from the forest's edge, smiling slightly at this life, dropping one's arms and eagerly drawing ancient joy, the vast autumn graves with new ghost shadows, the floating and sinking worn-out official of old poems, my Xiang has never reached the heart and bones, teaching me to listen to the sound of the rice, my ears are always sour.</p>
<p>Returning home at night, hanging lamps leave traces, shaking hands is extraordinarily strange, the cart and umbrella are numerous, most of them have been separated for three or five years, it is difficult to pour out in one or two days; when is the time for those who can dust their hats, who will summon the souls who jump into the sea when the trees fall? Idly leaning on the west wind, supporting cold eyes, the withered lotus shakes the water, half the lake is turbid.</p>
<h3>Signing In and Duty Roster</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>Every organization, for personnel management and performance evaluation, must have a sign-in book. Employees are required to sign in every morning and afternoon when coming to work. There are two ways to sign in: one is to write the name with a pen, and the other is to stamp a personal seal. Some even require noting the time of arrival. Superficially, this seems like a thorough way to manage personnel attendance. Moreover, the sign-in books are usually collected fifteen minutes after the designated office hours. The supervisor then signs the book. If any unsigned spaces are found (because each employee's signature position is pre-determined), the supervisor draws a straight line down the space, indicating that the employee was absent that day. The personnel management department then checks whether the employee had applied for leave. If not, the absence is recorded as absenteeism. If the employee arrives late and fills in the signature, it is recorded as tardiness. There are strict regulations for both absenteeism and tardiness in terms of performance evaluation.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the sign-in system in organizations is often a mere formality and a show of deception. Some employees are exempted from signing in with the special permission of their superiors; others, with strong backing, do not sign in regardless of permission; some have colleagues sign for them, while others ask laborers to sign for them. (Stamping a seal is even easier to cheat.) Some sign in the afternoon in the morning, and some sign for tomorrow today. Supervisors and personnel departments (offices) never send anyone to oversee the signing process. Therefore, only about 20-30% of employees actually sign in themselves. The biggest reason is that employees in slightly higher positions do not come to work on time, so tardiness and early departure become common among junior employees. Due to overstaffing, many supervisors hold multiple positions, and the workload is not demanding. It is not like bank employees, where each person manages a specific task, and if it is not completed today, it accumulates for tomorrow, forcing them to handle it sequentially. This leads to the bad habit of tardiness and early departure. Some supervisors treat a few employees differently, knowing that someone is late or absent but failing to deal with it impartially. Instead, they give them promotions and pay raises during performance evaluations. Personnel managers also hesitate to challenge based on "personnel independence" due to the opinions and favor of their supervisors. Due to these complex reasons, the sign-in book becomes a mere formality, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, every organization and every employee feels that the sign-in book is a symbol of pretense and deception, yet no one proposes to abolish it. This is the officialdom's way of "colluding in falsehood."</p>
<p>Equally meaningless as the sign-in book is the duty roster. The so-called duty roster (excluding military, police, and security agencies) requires employees to take turns on duty outside of the designated office hours, usually from 5:00 PM to 8:30 AM the next morning, and all day on holidays. The so-called duty means that major issues cannot be handled, and minor issues do not need to be handled. Even if there are some issues to be handled, they cannot be resolved because they are not familiar to the person on duty. At most, they can only temporarily receive and dispatch some letters and telegrams. It seems like overkill and a waste of resources (those on duty are usually paid duty allowance) to have several employees who are not from the receiving and dispatching group stay to handle letters and telegrams outside of office hours. Generally, those on duty simply write a few routine sentences in the duty log the next day, such as "Received and dispatched a few letters and telegrams, no other incidents occurred," and stamp it before handing over. In reality, they are not on duty but simply instruct the janitor on duty to take care of things. Therefore, the organization's duty roster is also like a false sign-in book. The government wastes duty allowances every day without achieving any real results. Some organizations have now abolished the duty roster and instead assigned one or two employees who live in the organization to be responsible for receiving external letters and telegrams after everyone else has left, with a modest monthly allowance. This is more reasonable, but unfortunately, only a few organizations have implemented this.</p>
<h3>Superstitions of the English</h3>
<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>Before the 19th century, the English also had many superstitious beliefs, similar to those in China. Here are some excerpts from the data recorded in ten volumes of folklore:</p>
<p>(1) When entering someone else's threshold, step in with the right foot first.</p>
<p>(2) Accidentally spilling salt is bad luck, but throwing a little over the left shoulder can avert disaster.</p>
<p>(3) When washing hands in the same basin with others, draw a cross in the water.</p>
<p>(4) Do not walk under a ladder.</p>
<p>(5) Rubbing someone else's crutch on one's right foot can cure rheumatism.</p>
<p>(6) Hanging a front leg and a hind foot of a field mouse in a bag around the neck can prevent toothache.</p>
<p>(7) Hanging red beads around the neck can prevent nosebleeds.</p>
<p>(8) Carrying a piece of amethyst in the pocket will prevent drunkenness.</p>
<p>(9) When a child has whooping cough, pluck a strand of hair and put it in bread for a dog to eat, so that the cough can be transferred to the dog to suffer instead of the child.</p>
<p>(10) Touching the eyes with a gold wedding ring can cure styes.</p>
<p>(11) Hanging an old horseshoe at home can bring good luck to the family.</p>
<p>(12) Rocking an empty cradle is unlucky for the child.</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Confucius said, "I desire to be silent." Some say that he said this disheartenedly after traveling around various countries and encountering obstacles everywhere. I don't think that's necessarily the case. A gentleman's words must be consistent with his actions, and his actions must be consistent with his words. Confucius was definitely not like today's loudmouths who cannot deliver on their promises. Since he couldn't deliver, it was better to remain silent. The highest realm of any thinker does not emphasize speech. Lao Tzu already said, "Those who know do not speak." Zhuang Tzu also advocated "forgetting words when one understands the meaning." When Sakyamuni explained the Dharma and mentioned the ultimate meaning of life, he only said "Inconceivable, inconceivable, unspeakable, unspeakable." The highest degree of love between a man and a woman is definitely not shouting "Love! Love!" but "mutual heart-to-heart connection," which absolutely does not require words.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the Water Margin, when Li Kui pretended to be a mute Taoist, he needed to put a coin in his mouth so he couldn't speak. When I was young, I laughed every time I saw this passage. Today, when I reopen the book and reread it, I no longer have the feeling of laughing easily. I only feel that Li Kui is everywhere, disguised as a mute Taoist! Alas – I desire to be silent. – However, I have finally said these words again. Will I ultimately become a verbose chatterbox?</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>In times of upheaval, many special terms naturally arise, which are both amusing and distressing to think about. For example, the word "powerful elite" has been widely publicized and familiar to everyone in the country in recent years, and is "condemned by thousands of people," yet there is no clear definition. Generally speaking, it seems to refer to "those who have special privileges and benefits and are beyond the reach of national laws and sanctions." This is how it differs from the "financial cliques" and "warlords" that were condemned in the past and forms a separate category. Therefore, punishing corruption is called "What about the powerful elite?" Investigating hoarding and price gouging is called "What about the powerful elite?" And the term "powerful elite" has become the target of public criticism. The word "powerful" was originally a complimentary term. Someone who can write ten thousand words as quickly as one who leans against a horse is said to have a "powerful writing style"; someone who can write a hundred poems after a斗of wine is said to have a "powerful poetic style"; someone with great talent, lofty aspirations, and a heroic spirit that surpasses the masses is said to be a "powerful person." The ancients said, "Sages, virtuous men, heroes, and outstanding figures," heroes and outstanding figures are only second to sages and virtuous men. Only "local bullies and evil gentry" are condemned by the world, but the problem lies in "local bullies and evil," not in "powerful gentry," just as "corrupt officials and wicked clerks" are hated for "corruption," not for being "officials and clerks." But today's so-called "powerful elite" refers to those who rely on power and profit to violate laws and regulations, which is a great misfortune for the word "powerful." Moreover, it is followed by "elite," which is like the elite of "the vermilion gates smell of wine and meat" and "entering the gate of a noble family is as deep as the sea," not the elite of "gates of propriety and paths of righteousness"!</p>
<p>Moreover, comparing "tiger hunting" with "fly swatting" is also seen in newspapers in the north and south, and the public has been clamoring for it for a long time. In fact, it is a variation of "when jackals are in power, who cares about foxes," which seems a bit newer and more lively, and can also serve as a footnote to "powerful elite." It is a pity that China lacks a scientific foundation. Despite the emergence of new terms and endless creations, the importance of first giving a clear definition has been ignored. In recent years, it is not that corruption has not been punished. When one is punished, the public cries out: "This is a small shrimp, not a tiger!" When another is punished, they also say: "This is a small tiger, not a big tiger!" When another is punished, they cry out again: "This is a fake tiger, not a real tiger!" To what extent is it a big tiger? What kind of person is a real tiger? There is no consensus. Therefore, there is only a feeling of injustice, but no actual effect of "rectifying the injustice."</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. He, a member of the Political Committee for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property, who came from the south to Tianjin, invited people from all walks of life in Tianjin and delivered a long speech, stating that most of the enemy and puppet properties were forcibly occupied by powerful forces, and now he is determined to solve the problem thoroughly and forcibly move them out, with very clear language. He also said, "I would rather drive away the powerful elite than drive away the refugees. I will first deal with the upper-class people and then deal with the lower-class people." The terms "upper-class people" and "lower-class people" are also very new and ingenious. The term "lower-class people" existed in ancient times, such as the "precept stone" in county government offices, which read "It is easy to abuse the lower-class people, but it is difficult to deceive Heaven." Now, adding the term "upper-class people" to contrast with it is also another footnote to "powerful elite." As the saying goes, "One must endure all hardships to become an upper-class person." How should today's "upper-class people" be interpreted? It is very thought-provoking... Reply from the Water Company to a reader of this newspaper...</p>

<h3>Poor Water Supply on Dagu Road Due to Clogged Pipes and Small Diameter</h3>
<p>— Reply from the Water Company to a reader of this newspaper</p>
<p>Received your letter of September 22 regarding the poor water supply in Lane 468 and 506 of Dagu Road. We have sent personnel to inspect the area and cut off a section of the water pipe for thorough examination. The reason for the poor water flow is that the water pipes in the area have been in use for too long, and the inside of the pipes is clogged with sediment from the water, causing the poor water flow. In addition, the diameter of the water pipes is also too small.</p>
<p>Our company is committed to serving the people and will do our best to improve the situation within our capabilities. Our company has an inspection and repair department specifically for this type of work. We hope that this explanation will be provided to your newspaper's readers so that they can understand the truth. In the future, if users encounter difficulties with the water supply, they can notify our company at any time so that we can send personnel to repair it quickly. Sincerely, Wei Bo, Deputy Chief Engineer. October 26, 1937.</p>

<p>1,600 years ago, French women had already started using face powder.</p>
<p>In 1785, Benjamin Franklin in France received an airmail letter from England. Of course, the letter did not rely on an airplane to cross the English Channel and reach Mr. Franklin's hands. It was a balloon.</p>
<p>3,000 years before the Christian era, women in Babylonian humorous places had already started using metal hairpins.</p>
<p>700 years before the Christian era, Egyptian workers went on strike because their wages were overdue.</p>
<p>1,300 years before the Christian era, Egyptian women liked to wear various exquisite bracelets, often with small gadgets such as bells and whistles attached to them. (Lin)</p>
