<h3>翁院長王財長堅辭　政院今晨開會討論</h3>
<p>〔南京二日電〕行政院定三日晨舉行例會翁文灝將對其辭職事提出報吿，並予討論。據悉翁氏本人辭意極爲堅決，內閣將隨之總辭，但迄二日晚各政委間尙無此項接觸，如有總辭意，亦將俟三日晨政院例會中決定，翁於二日下午在立院報吿時，曾一再聲明辭職，並强調今後經濟問題有待後任之努力。翁氏係以政院通過經濟改革補充辦法目的雖在挽救當前經濟危機，然其所主持之財政經濟改革，亦因放棄限價而全盤失敗，故自卅一日起卽迭向總統提出辭呈，並面請辭職，總統對翁氏仍在慰留中。主持經濟改革及實行新幣制之財長王雲五，亦係卅一日向翁請辭，王爲表示其堅決起見，自一日起卽未到部公，二日亦未出席立院報吿，而係由其次長徐柏園代表。王於二日晨對往訪之記者表示，希望政府早日決定財長繼任人選，渠本人擬從事執敎工作。</p>
<p>翁氏出席立院報告　聲明財經改革失敗</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕立法院第二會期第十六次會議，二日晨九時半舉行，孫院長主席，首以秘密方式由秘書處宜讀政院咨文，略以立院兩度質詢案均經收到，政院對當前嚴重之財經局勢，業加注意，並已於十月卅日決定公布經濟改革補充辦法四項，以謀補救，特請査照。然各委員對行政院翁院長及其閣僚之未列席會議咸表不滿，趙惠謨發言，指責政府率爾放棄限價，失信於人民之不當，並稱，不論翁院長辭職與否，仍應負責，應請翁院長，王財長到院報吿，並答覆質問，不能「查照」了事。當經主席徵詢會衆意見，無異議通過午後請翁院長，王財長等報吿，並備質詢。旋於十時公開進行議程所列各案，至十二時散會。下午三時許續會，翁院長文灝偕同主計長徐堪，交長兪大維，糧長關吉玉，社會部長谷正綱，財次徐柏園，工商部次長張子柱等應邀列席，並作報吿·翁氏首聲明渠所致力之財經改革業已失敗，渠本人已引咎辭職，財經改革預期目標計有十項，檢討實施以來之結果，（一）平衡收支，完全失敗。（二）收回金銀外幣，則有相當成果。（三）取締高利貸。（四）增加銀行存款。（五）辦理外匯。外幣存款。（六）禁止資金逃避等項，起始均頗有成就，後均失敗。（七）穩定物價工作，亦因上列各項失敗之影響，終未作通。至（八）獎勵生產，毫無成就，（九）提高對外貿易額，（十）增加僑匯收入兩項，最初成效立著，今日竟全然無有。政府於九月底卽發覺各項目標均未能如預期逐步達成，當卽擬定計劃，自十月一日起採取步驟，合理調整民生必需物品價格，開放生產貨款，改善公敎人員待遇，增加工資，提高國營公用事業價格，然以北匪攻勢陡猛，國軍一再失利，該項計劃未遑如期實行，此一貽誤之後，各都市搶購風潮相繼而起，終至生產運銷全部停頓，財經局勢空前嚴重，激起搶購風潮之主因，無庸諱言，自爲通貨膨脹，軍政支出浩繁，國營交通公用事業復全賴貼補維持，金圓券之發行遂劇增不已，而收兌金銀外幣亦造成大批游資，政府曾採施各種吸收游資之辦法，如商業行莊限期增資，出售國營事業及敵僞產業，發行短期國庫劵等，然事實上金圓極少回籠，收效至微。而財經局勢又復惡化不已，乃有十月卅日決定公布之補充辦法，以謀補救。</p>
<p>今後四項重要工作　胥待後任繼續努力</p>
<p>翁氏指出，今後必須繼續致力之工作，不外以下諸端：（一）儘量緊縮開支，（二）儘量减少貼補，（三）吸收游資，（四）有效扶助生產事業，鼓勵增加輸出，如此則可使物資充裕，發行减少，以恢復金圓券信用。翁氏於此，復强調渠本人已辭職，成效如何，胥待後任努力，繼就經改補充辦法說明數點，放寬限價爲補充辦法主旨之一，蓋自政府財經改革，發行金圓券後，游資已漸充斥市塲，而匪方復百端擾亂破壞，至市塲紊亂，供求失調，非如此不能限止物資流入匪區，以恢復工商業之正常秩序。（二）「核本定價」之辦法，爲由各地同業公會擬議各貨價格呈經地方政府，依其成本核定實行。（三）關於調整文武人員待遇，原則已決定，以生活必需品之物價爲準，具體辦法尙未擬定。（四）扶助生產事業之辦法，包括供給日本賠償物資機器撥予外匯定購外國原料，機件等項，翁氏報吿約半小時，各委員當報以熱烈掌聲。</p>
<h3>關吉玉報告糧政　徐柏園代表王財長答詢　立委紛紛抨擊政院失策</h3>
<p>繼由關吉玉報吿糧食供應情形，渠列舉大略數字，說明現須由中央政府統籌凖備之軍糧，公糧，配給糧等，總共約七千五百萬担，其來源除田賦征實征借，可收到約二千五百萬祖外，其餘均須購進，計收購省縣級公糧餘額約六百餘萬担，委託各地省政府代辦約一千六百餘萬担，委託國家銀行代購約二千六百餘萬祖（向國外購進部分約八百萬祖）收購頗爲不易，但政府正全力辦理。本年各地糧食產量雖不甚豐稔，但秋收之後，不應卽有糧荒，檢討各地缺糧原因，不外三點：（一）限價太低，因搶購而隱匿，（二）各地禁止糧食出境，米市來源不暢，（三）物資不能交流，農戶，糧戶不願脫手，經營補充辦法已規定糧食按市價自由運銷，自可取消此三種缺糧之原因，消彌一時人爲之糧荒。關氏報吿畢，各委員責問財長王雲五何以拒絕列席，翁院長乃令徐柏園代爲說明，徐氏當聲稱，王部長已於日昨一向翁院畏辭職，故朱應邀列席，一關於財經改革實施之經過，業中一翁院長詳盡報吿，如有何質詢，願代王部長答覆，旋開始質誼，發言委員計有黄元彬·黄建中·李雲良·趙惠謨·溫士源·陳明仙·宋述樵等七人，然抨繫政院失誤及演講個人意見者多，提出質詢者少，黄元彬主張妥善利用收回之金銀外幣，以挽回危機。黄建中·趙惠談均調强揚子公司案應追査質詢，政府收兌金鈔，何不自豪門鉅富開刀，而將中小產積蓄騙走。趙惠謨並主張由總統公告全國人民，以後財政赤字之彌補，將完全以豪門鉅富財產抵充，以抑止發行膨脹，安定社會人心。陳明仙質問財經改革以來由限價而至取消限價，人民所受損失如何補償，財富更爲集中如何糾正，而受特刑庭拘辦之無辜商民之案件如何公平合理結束，宋述樵則指實制度錯誤，行政院爲責任內閣，乃竟不對立法院負責，事事決諸總統，爲一切失敗錯誤之根源，質詢至五時五十分，猶有委員十五人未得發言機會，孫院長當徵詢會衆意見，擬停止質詢，由翁院長口頭答覆，翁氏表示不擬卽席答覆，若干委員亦主張「不必答覆了」，乃卽宣吿散會。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕經合中國分署署長賴樸翰，業於二日自舊金山乘汎美航空公司班機返華，此間分署預計賴氏可於四日晚間，飛抵本市龍華機塲。</p>
<p>〔中央社舊金山二日合衆電〕美經合總署中國分署署長賴樸翰，頃叙述中國全部形勢，認爲頗爲黯淡，並警吿美國必須將冷戰擴張至中國，俾擊敗共黨。此前舊金山市長稱：美國若放棄中國，則非美國之福，中國乃亞洲最電要之一部·彼稱，瀋陽之陷落並非謂共黨已在內戰中勝利．賴氏又謂：若共黨控制中國時，則其成立之任何政府，對美國將不友好．吾人目前對華之中間路綫政策，已不適用。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日電〕卽將代表國會對外經濟合作聯席委會赴華之蒲立德氏，其任務在調査援華計劃之進行情形，並與蔣總統會商硏討中國之軍事局勢。聯席委會以共和黨參議員勃里奇爲主席，該會正計劃向新國會提出一項報吿，如杜威當選總統並將提出一項援華建議，蒲氏於聖誕節前後返抵華府後，顯將爲杜威提供實地調査所得之充分情報，以便於一月二十日後擬訂一項對華方案。勃里奇之委員會將詢諸中國何以迄未領到美國之軍事援助物資，美方援華滯延之故又安在。今日各報皆報道稱：首批「大量」援華軍用品將於兩日內啓運，此顯係我國駐此之代表與美陸軍部最近獲得最後協議後始傳山者。參院某高級人士稱，美國向中國出售軍火時索取「最高價格」，而他國向美採購物資者，則僅累取原價百分之二十。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕美外交官員稱，自日本投降以來，中國得自美國方面之借款及援助等在二十億美元以上，其中三分之一爲軍事援助，本年份之援助總數則已銳减，國會方於本年度批准一億二千五百萬美元之軍事援華計劃，國務院宜布，中國一日又動用一億二千五百萬美元軍事援助中之五百萬美元，現尙存一千五百萬美元，大部份配備已購買就緒，但仍待裝運·美政府與中國大使館均不致發表根據加速令而擬裝運之軍械與配備之種類，傳其中包括小武器。</p>

<h3>東北　中國　亞洲　世界</h3>
<p>——歡迎蒲立德先生再度來華——</p>
<p>紐約前鋒論壇報記者史迪祿，前日在平訪問　蔣總統，對於中國在世界反共鬥爭中之重要性，中國在另一次世界大戰中所處地位，以及若果不幸共黨控制中國對世界局勢將發生何種影饗等問題，一一提出詢問？蔣總統當卽鄭重答覆，除了率直指出東北問題與世界危機的密切關係而外，並謂：「中國正在努力剿共，消弭足以威脅世界和平之有力因素，而阻止第三次世界大戰之爆發。」「共產國際實行世界革命之傳統策略，及其當前擴張勢九之方向，皆以亞洲爲其主要目標，而亞洲之前途，又以中國爲决定點。共產黨之信條，欲控制世界，必先控制亞洲，欲控制亞洲，又必先控制中國。余可斷言，中國如爲共黨所控制，第三次世界大戰必由此爆發，使人類重遭悲慘之災禍。』</p>
<p>總統對美記者這一席話，充分顯示出總統對於世界局勢，不僅有正確的看法，而且洞若觀火；所以中外報章雜誌均一律刋載，讀者也無不欽佩總統的眞知灼見。回憶十七年以前，日本軍閥發動九一八事變，以武力攫取我東北的時候。列强的外交當局，雖美國史汀生曾有「不承認」主義的呼籲，但畢竟沒有一個人認淸這是日本征服世界的起點，也就是第二次世界大戰的信號，只聽任中國獨力苦撑。爲時未久，終究演成普及全世界的第二次大戰，方才恍然大悟，第二次大戰是導源於中國的東北。可惜人類還是健忘，以美國故大總統羅斯福之雄才大略，在大戰勝利結束行將結束之際，忽略了這個慘痛的教訓，雅爾達會議對於東北問題的安排，又替我東北問題留下禍根！迨大戰結束，最近三年來東北的兵連禍結，以至造成今日與「九一八」時相類以的局勢，都是棋錯一着所釀成的。不幸這個新的危機，又爲世人所忽視，以致兩三年中縱承美國有時斷時續的「援華」呼籲，而迄未見其有適時的緊急行動，目前此一危機旣由蔣總統率直指出，當可喚醒列强外交當局，對於亞洲特別提高警覺了吧。</p>
<p>平心而論，所謂「杜魯門主義』，所謂「馬歇爾計劃」，無不以反共爲其一貫的目標，尤其列强在對蘇「冷戰」中，更無不竭智盡能，全力以赴，而最近高唱入雲的「北大西洋防共聯盟，似尤有聲有色，但是我們放眼看看一年以來的反共鬥爭，却不能不說「步步退却，着着落後」。在柏林封鎖的問題，我們雖然看到西方盟國的堅定立塲，但是「先歐後亞」的策略，却爲共產勢力所乘，先從東南亞入手，使東南亞各國均受共產勢力的威脅，共產國際的視綫，乃又移至東北亞，南韓的發生叛變與我東北的整個落入共黨之手，卽足以證明，東北亞亦將受共產國際的控制。再看戰後的美國對華政策，美國政府在原則上雖也採取援助政策，不　的在經濟上軍事上援助中國，但在援助的數量上及時間上，都成了問題，大有「杯水車薪」「遠水近火」之感。這種政策的錯誤，若不早日設法補救，則遠東的危機固恐無法挽救，而將來終有一天危及整個世界的和平！</p>
<p>美國國內當不乏賢明才智之士，尤其是蒲立德和周以德諸位先生，早已看到遠東危機的日趨嚴　，美國現行對華政策足以造成歷史性的錯誤，不辭辛努，奔走呼號，要求美國朝野正視現實，提高警覺，迅速加緊進行援華工作，蒲立德先生前此遊華歸國而後，發表其「訪華觀感』一文，義正詞嚴，更爲世界有心人士所傳誦，不獨爲吾中國人民所深戚。而今蒲立德先生奉國會之命，不日再度來華，實地考察中國的政情及診斷亞洲的危機，値得我們格外重視，熱烈歡迎。惟因時機迫切，已到了千鈞一髮的關頭，一切都要力求迅速。我們盼望蒲立德先生早日來華，俾將亞洲的實情，早日帶回國去，好教美國朝野對於東北·中國·亞洲·世界的危機，特別提高警覺，千　不要再把中國政府的勦匪戡亂祗當是中國內部之事，更不可固執着「先歐後亞」的成見，使共產極權國家的勢力蔓延了整　中國和亞洲，以致後悔莫及！</p>
<h3>我高級船員團體函司使　反對扶植日航業　響應美輪業聯合會主張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國商船高級船員團體聯合會幹事姜克尼稱：日本因美政府採取積極扶植政策，不久將來卽可實現新船四百萬噸的理想，目前日本已積極建造新船，某船廠已開始建造商船十九艘，此種趨勢，對中國航業實爲莫大威脅，務望關心中國航業建設人士，加以注意。茲悉：五高級船員團體爲響應美航商反對扶日航業，特於上月致函司徒大使，轉請美國政府限制日本航業，茲將原函錄後：司徒雷登大使閣下：根據貴國强斯敦考察團報吿，日本航業得以恢復一九三〇至一九三四年標準，換言之，卽貴國將允許日本恢復商船噸位四百萬噸，重樹其侵略勢力，此舉對於遠東盟國，構成極大威脅，尤以中國，於勝利以後，因種種因素，未能步入建設的坦途，而昔日首先侵略中國土地，屠殺中國人民，並破壞中國船舶噸位之敵人，又在貴國扶植之下，迅速地恢復其稱覇遠東的壓倒優秀，此在事實上與心理上，均不能不令敝國人士對於貴國此項政策產生異常不良的反響。本會等在航言航，無論勞資，對此均已先後提出抗議，而澳，菲，蘇等其他各國，對於貴國過分扶日政策，亦早經作嚴正反對之表示，想均在洞鑒之中。現讀代表貴國輪船業三分之二以上之美國輪船業聯合會對强斯敦報吿之抗議文件，其所持理由及其遠大之見地，深足令人欽佩，可見公道尙在人間，用特再函貴大使，請轉貴國政府，對於恢復日本航業，應仍以使之僅能使用於國內貿易及其附近之島嶼爲標準，否則勢將構成威脅遠東和平，危及世界安寗，務希垂察爲幸。中國商船駕駛員總會，中國航海駕駛員聯合會，中國輪機師總會，中國船舶無綫電員總會，淞漢區引水公會同啓。</p>

<h3>美五千萬人民開始投票　大選結果今午揭曉　東部兩城鎭社威先聲奪人　進步黨與南部選票對杜魯門打擊頗大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約二日廣播：西佛琴尼亞州却爾斯登城大選結果：杜威獲一八二票，杜魯門獲五五票，杜威顯佔優勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐漢姆夏州巴特鎮二日電〕本鎮爲各國各地大選結果之第一個揭曉者，計杜魯門得一票，杜威得十一票。一九四四年大選中，羅斯福得六票，杜威得四票。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約二日電〕四千七百萬至五千萬之美國自由男女，可望在二日投票選舉渠等之總統，一半奴役一半自由之世界，亦正期待此一選舉之結果。美國全境，雖然若干地方將有陰雨；但大部份將屬晴朗，選舉將在黎明時於大西洋海岸開始，隨太陽之升起，逐漸西移，若干新英關各州鄉村將計算渠等之選票，在早餐時間之無綫電節目中報吿。第一次主要選舉結束之時間及地點，將爲東方標準時間下午四時在肯塔基州東部，最後之選票投入之時間及地點，將爲下午十一時前在華盛頓州。在此一時間後不久，通訊社及報紙將能計算得代表各州之約八百萬票之請，除非選舉之結果非常接近，其趨勢當可在子夜前瞭然。杜魯門將於東方標準時間上午十一時在其故鄉米蘇里州之獨立城投票，渠已決定在二日晚及早就寢，而不願選舉之大勢足否決定。但其秘書羅斯稱：渠在必要時可能在晚間呌醒杜魯門。杜威在紐約一百二十一東區第五號街之某公立學校中投票，然後返羅斯福飯店之共和黨總部，等待選舉結果。杜威爲唯一列名於全國各州選票之總統候選人，杜魯門失去亞拉巴瑪州，在該州，民主黨之名義及標幟，爲州權派所得，州權派候選人　蒙列名於十三州之選票中。進步黨候選人華萊士得四十五州，社會黨候選人湯麥斯得三十一州。關於州權派，進步黨及社會黨之選票，均足以分散杜魯門之實力。杜威奪得民主黨窠巢之南部各州中沸羅里達及丹納西二州之希望頗濃。選民並將選舉參議員三十二人，衆議員四百三十二人，州長三十二及無數次要之官員。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約一日電〕杜魯門總統一日晚打破選舉前夕之政治休戰慣例，在其故鄉獨立城對全國廣播，攻擊杜威及共和黨。杜威深信二日子夜（上海時間三日下午一時）選舉結果揭曉之時，彼必將獲勝。渠在最後之競選演說中，籲請美國人民踴躍投票，並呼籲共和。民主兩黨，在選舉揭曉後團結一致。但杜魯門之廣播中幾乎加以拒絕，渠稱：二日之選舉，將係一種選擇，卽人民需要民主黨政府下之和平與繁榮，抑共和黨政府下之戰爭及蕭條。</p>
<h3>美兩黨主要決鬥　在於控制參議院　共和黨能否獲勝亦并無把握</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山一日電〕民意測驗，普遍預料共和黨仍將在衆議院佔四十至五十席之多數，而控制衆議院。但主要之決鬥，將係對參議院之控制，目前參議院包括共和黨五十一名，民主黨四十五名，但其中有三十二名識員（共和黨十七名，民主黨十五名）之任期至本年屆滿，故兩黨均須爲本黨黨負重新入選而競爭。本屆選舉之日，亦無民意測驗者敢預測共和黨確能在參議員選舉中獲勝。</p>
<p>其他一民意測驗，則謂參議院將由兩黨平分秋色，各佔四十八席。若參議院如此形成，則副總統在立法事項上擁有決定性之投票權。今年美國大選，對國外關係極大，故國務院主辦之「美國之音」將於明晚以十六種語言報吿大選之結果。</p>
<h3>杜魯門預感　不再作白宮主人</h3>
<p>喻白宮爲全球最佳牢獄</p>
<p>〔中央社堪薩斯城一日電〕如美國所舉行之民意測驗爲正確者，則杜威明日將被選爲美國第卅三任總統，而杜魯門總統則將被釋出被渠所目爲全球最佳牢獄之白宮。杜魯門今晚在此間宴會中發表演說稱：諸君俱知美總統爲全球重要之囚犯，而白宮乃全球最佳之牢獄。杜魯門總統或已預感渠不致再在白宮中作四年辛勤之主人。</p>
<h3>紐約全市警察　出動協助大選</h3>
<p>股票市塲一致堅挺</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約二日電〕紐約市全市警察一萬八千二百三十二人，二日率命爲大選特別出動。淸晨六時，二千二百名偵探已四出値勤，驅逐一切不良份子，使不能留於街道中，書局長華倫道下令嚴防意外。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約一日電〕在美國大選之前夕，紐約股票市塲一致堅挺，大多數經紀人希望共和黨勝利後能修改若干民主黨政府之交易限制。按是等限制之目的，在防止重蹈一九二九年經濟一崩潰之覆轍。</p>
<h3>美大選聲中　進步黨將受考驗</h3>
<p>區選票恐不能獲得一張</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約二日電〕華萊士之進步新黨，將在二日之投票所中遭遇首次大考驗。根據全國大選前之預測，華氏恐不能獲得區選舉票一張，至於普選票則約在二百萬之譜。華氏直至大選日爲止，始終努力奮鬥，然絕口不提可得若干票，反之，渠再三宜佈該黨必可維持其壽命。</p>
<h3>聯大今日召開全體會議　討論原子能管制　各方靜候美國大選結束</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎一日電〕聯合國政委會二日恢復討論希臘問題，然舉世第一流外交家均在靜候美大選之結果，政委會計劃整日開會，俾結束一般辯論而產生具體行動。聯大並擬於三日舉行全體大會，考慮對原子能僵局作最後決定。傳大多數代表均凖備擁護美國之原子能管制計劃。</p>
<p>聯大亦將不顧蘇聯反對，討論政委會通過之決議一項，按該案要求五强及加拿大共商原子能問題有否協議之可能，而向下屆大會提出報吿。安理會將於四日研究巴勒斯坦問題，大選後之美國外交將首次受到考驗。安理會將考慮中英兩國提案，主將命令阿猶雙方退回十月十四日戰爭爆發前之原陣地，而令猶方放棄所佔地區，如一方抗命，決議案主將加以制裁。美代表團原來支持中英提案，其後杜魯門總統直接干預，致美國收回支持成命。大選後美國立塲如何，則尙無跡象可尋。聯大代表十九對美大選備極關懷，僉信如共和黨獲選，美代表團之策略將有若干更易，然一般美外交政策則不致改變。反之，如杜魯門獲勝，美政策將一致加緊而必有若干重要改變，以結束主要之辯論。國務卿馬歇爾一日晚已自倫敦返此，可能出任杜威國務卿之杜爾斯則於週末巡視斯坎的那維亞國家後，亦已返抵巴黎。僉信馬杜兩氏均已草定辦法，俾國內報吿能迅速傳抵此間</p>
<h3>蕭翁評史達林談話　不信蘇會發動戰爭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二日電〕蕭伯訥在英共黨之「每日工人報」上撰文稱，「史達林上週之坦白明確之談話，係一陣新鮮空氣｛英國報紙不懂共產主義之意義，因此行動乖張，對渠等之反對派有無的放矢之舉正猶居於市郊無理取鬧之人，以死貓隔一層花園牆垣而互相投擲，然一隻死貓則名之爲極權主義，另一隻則名之爲警察國家，第三隻則名之爲防衛蘇聯侵略。但無情之事實，却係此數隻死貓皆自吾人方面所投擲。史達林最所恐懼者，顯然係另一次帝國主義戰爭，渠對國內統治忙碌不堪，無暇作不可能之軍事征服及世界吞併。」蕭翁繼稱，西方所指斥之蘇聯極權主義及警察國家，在英聯邦內現正盛極一時，吾人雖攻擊所謂秘密警察，然吾人並未因此而卽將吾國之犯罪調査部及警察廳廢除。</p>

<h3>市長召見沒糧等業代表　聽取調整價格情形勸諭勿圖暴利　限令今起恢復交易　鮮肉蔬菜兩業表示售價必可回跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午四時，在市府辦公室召見米·油·麵粉·鮮肉·蔬菜·雜糧等民生日用必需品同業公會理事長談話，垂詢限價取消後各項物品價格之調整倍數，懇切曉諭切勿高抬物價，圖取暴利，已登記之存貨更應從低發售，萬不能抱觀望態度，限令今日起恢復買賣，儘量供應市面需要。昨應召到市府者，計有米業萬墨林·　振華·麵粉業席德柄·榮毅仁·豬業洪文江·鮮肉業朱高·油業張超·雜糧業傳昌裕·蔬菜業馬文彪等。據鮮肉業同業公會理事長朱志高表示：今日起鮮肉卽可儘量供應，議定新價爲每斤三元半左右，決不超過四元。昨傳每斤五六元，絕非正式行情，乃單帮外埠運來抬價圖利者。渠並保證：二星期後，來源暢阡後，肉價可跌進每斤三元以內。</p>
<p>麵粉業榮毅仁表示：麵粉價格亦經議定，廠盤每袋三十元，零售約爲三十四元。昨起陸續供應。本本市第日需要之麵粉量約爲一萬一千餘担，昨日供應六千餘担，當逐漸求其增加。惟工廠停工已達半月，全中恢復原狀，約須在一星期之後。</p>
<p>蔬菜業代表馬文彪表示：近兩日蔬菜價格高低不一，尚無定價，吳市長囑轉吿攤販不准抬價一點，該業公會並無此實權，惟擬轉知菜販同人互助會囑轉吿，渠認爲昨日菜價不能作爲標準，因到貨稀少，致價被抬高，深信內來源通暢後，菜價必吿跌。</p>
<p>又據米業　振華吿記者：食米市價爲每担九十元，新價是否穩定，須視米源情形而定，因太市米價須很據產區價格而定，如來源充沛，米價卽不致上漲。惟本市各米店因受八一九限價政策影饗，損失慘重，資資金薄弱，現米業同業昨已呈文市府，請予救濟，吳市長已允攷慮。又米商代表曾向市府請求，復業後交易予以保障，吳市長業已令飭警局對米店正當交易加以保護。</p>
<p>吳市長於接見各業代表後，復於午午五時半在辦公室接見記者，報吿談話經過，並答覆各報社記者各項題如下：（一）謀控制物價，擬組織議價委員會，正由社會局負責籌備中。（二）議價實行後，本月八日卽將配發之市民配購證，並不保證供應物資義務。（三）公用事業調整價格一事，須待煤觔，原料，及工資計算成本完畢後，始可核定。（四）職工待遇調整是否仍採用生活指數，將由中央決定。</p>
<h3>捲烟准自由賣買　議價工業原料　社局暫定十種　一部份物價已核定</h3>

<p>昨經社會局核准調整價格者，計有醫院診費增加百分之一百五十。書業增價百分之一百五十。豆油議價亦經決定自六十圓調整至一百九十圓，增百分之二百二十弱。又電影與戲劇二業前日核准增價百分之一百五十，昨日不及實行，改自今日起調整。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕前在因案伏法之張亞民遺書中曾被一再提及並謂係渠唯一知己之本市名坤票王蕙蘅，突於上月卅一日夜吞服大量安眠藥片自殺，經發覺念救，因中毒過深，迄昨晚止尙未離險境。王女此次自殺動機，據女父王準臣談稱，已早在張亞民遺書揭露，張妻刊登廣吿覓女璧遺照片之時，當時王闔家但見女神色抑鬱，終日寡歡，初亦未加注意，嗣女常寫詩作曲，滿紙哀怨，最近更攝就美術照片多種，持詢戚友：「那一幀做我的遺像最適合？」始知其漸露死志，上月廿九日晚，王女尙偕家人赴碧蘿飯店晚餐，席間曾低唱程派戲中感傷之句，卅一日夜半，女父起身往其寢室，擬作防備性之探視，詎料竟發現各門早已嚴局，經設法破門入內，發覺女面色蒼白，枕邊留有致父母之遺書一封，安眠藥片空盒散置滿地。據事後調查，此項藥片係屬最猛烈之治痛安眠藥片，王女事前陸續購藏達百餘片之多，服毒時卽一次吞食四十片，可證其厭世之念極堅。至其遺書中，除預囑身後須卜葬虹橋公墓外，並謂：「環境優越，物質享受，都不能稍减精神刺激：…人生若戲劇，想不到我演的竟是短短的程派戲……」。此外渠尙留有四十六首遺詩，更充滿求死之意。據王父吿人：王女天資聰慧，酷喜音樂藝術，早年曾從程硯秋習戲，渠在入中西女校讀書後，因不愛數學理科，故決意欲出國專攻音樂，今年春間曾數度設法，以外匯申請困難，卒未實現，致情懷鬱鬱，對演戲亦突感厭倦。嗣於四月間在某宴會中，王女由親友介紹，得識張亞民，五月中黃家花園牡丹會上，王女又與張相値，經張固請攝一照片留念，王女乃在小橋上斜倚欄干，匆促拍成，該幀照片後經張洗印甚多，分送親友，張本人亦留有兩張，結果其遺書上遂有托妻　還照片之語，此照片即爲攝於黃家花園者。惟因張在遺書中頻頻稱「蕙」，復以張妻刋登啓事，王女左右不免時聞指摘，渠個性極强，受此刺激，感人言可畏，始決定仰藥求死。據王女之奶娘談：王準臣祗有此一女，鍾愛異常，王平時雖常挈其赴交際塲所，但因其沉默寡言，始終無一男友，張亞民雖曾與其晤面數次，亦僅屬泛泛之交，且王女今年尙未滿雙十，渠父更不願爲其遽論嫁娶·此次王女服毒後，王準臣夫婦曾數度昏厥，現因渠神經及腦髓中毒液尙未淸淨，正由王廷請本市名醫五六人竭力施救中。</p>
<p>張距民寄還之照片，攝於黃家花園者。</p>
<h3>蔣經國檢討經管工作　沉痛指出限價失敗原因</h3>
<p>上海區經濟管制督導員蔣經國，二日下午二時半於召集戡建大隊與靑年服務總隊隊員訓話時，檢討二月餘來之經管工作，沉痛指出限價政策之失敗實由於大家沉不住氣，天下從無未付代價之收穫。限價政策要求大家忍受一時之痛苦以求大多數人民生活之長期安定。今日放棄限價雖有人感覺鬆了口氣，但大多數人民感受之高物價威脅，不知將伊於胡底。惟蔣氏以堅決沉着之認調聲稱，放棄限價，不是放棄同奸商之鬥爭。那一個犯法，我們在上海一天，便要捉一天奸商。渠喊出一個口號「正義的力量今天要團結起來，相信上海終必屬於正義之青年」蔣氏全篇演詞慷慨激昂充滿熱情，聆訓之數千靑年無不大受感動，渠勗勉靑年同志，遭遇挫折不可灰心，檢討七十天來之工作，深感新起的力量尙朱成熟長成，而反動勢九已結成一條陣綫，狼狽爲奸，蓋若　深懼「新的力量抬頭，就沒有他們」。吾人有高度的情緒，坦白的胸懷，但尙缺乏鬥爭之經驗，不足以對付老奸巨滑之經濟上敵人。惟吾人之政策並無錯誤，爲國家，不能有個人，爲了大多數人民，不能顧少數人的利益，吾人這一政策，對國家，對人民，問心無媿。故七十天的心血，沒有白化，吾人有其代價，人民今日雖不盡知，但將來必然會知道戡建大隊與靑年服務總隊之隊員沒有取上海人一文錢，忠心耿耿爲人民服務。蔣氏續稱：人民爲吾人之主人，在任何情形下忠實之僕人當仍須繼續努力，服務不　。吾人與官僚不同之點即在於彼爲做官，而我爲服務，渠深爲痛心之點，即當經濟管制逐步實施時，人民己不能沉住氣。渠稱吾人並非蠻幹，而係有計劃，有辦法，吾人向國外購買之原料本月內卽可到達，因爲米源不暢，乃決定以棉布棉紗糖與嘉興，靑浦等縣交換糧食，亦已商妥，於本月十五日起開始源源供應，然一般人民似已不克等待。蔣氏復稱：渠在上海的兩個多月，已更深體驗「任勞任怨」與「老奸巨滑」兩詞之含議，渠勉勵各隊員痛下功夫，充實戰鬥技術，整理隊伍，加强組織，深入民間，協助政府，解決人民之痛苦，防止經濟敵人之分化。渠表示將於最近在本市設立大規模之幹部訓練班，使成爲上海靑年組織之重心，以熱烈之心胸，冷靜之頭腦，走向戰鬥的前途，「不爭一時，而爭千秋」。</p>
<p>勗勉戡建暨青年服務隊員　團結起來繼續與奸商鬥爭</p>

<h3>存放款利率提高　出口業希望從速調整匯率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財部巳接受本市銀錢業之請求，將放款利率提高至月息一角八分，較原定利率增加幾達五倍，本市金管局接獲部令後，隨卽召開會議，並將此項決定通知銀錢業。按日來銀根甚緊，暗息高至四角以上，過去規定之利率巳不切實際，故財部經銀行業申請後，決予以提高。</p>
<p>又訊：限價開放後，金圓劵對外匯率之調整，已屬所必然，工商界對此問題，咸甚注意。工業界希望匯率決定時應特別愼重，以免妨害國內生產事業·出口業希望從速調整外匯整，否則該業將陷於停頓狀態。主管機關對此尙在研究之中，爲兼顧進出口起見，可能恢復結匯證明書制度。</p>
<p>又訊：據央行稽核處發表：九月份本市行莊之活期存款·共達金圓劵二一四，七九一，九〇〇·二九圓，定期存款爲二五，九九四，〇二二·五二圓，兩者合計爲二四〇，七八五，九二二·八一圓。已繳之準備金則爲四〇，三二九，〇三九·三〇金圓。</p>
<h3>食米貨稀價俏</h3>
<p>南市白粳高檔做九十圓</p>
<p>南米市塲到貨合共爲一千一百六十八石，來源續增，而供應仍少，現貨寥寥，交易做開甚少。白粳，薄稻，高檔價格均爲九十元早稻中檔貨由七十三元升至七十七元，杜尖高貨開八十五元，市勢比上日堅倘。北米市塲到貨較前日减少，總共僅二三七石，塲內交易因無貨而停頓。</p>
<h3>食糖做開不多　上漲兩倍有半</h3>
<p>食糖昨市同業已紛紛入塲，談價雖多，而實際交易甚稀，廿四號粗砂喊價在一百零五元左右，有少數做開，較限價約漲二倍半光景，餘貨尙無所聞。</p>
<h3>食油交易恢復</h3>
<p>食油市塲昨起恢復交易，由社會局面示，准規定豆油價格爲一九〇元，其他油價，可參酌豆油價格交易。十一時市塲交易展開，同業齊集，擁擠全塲，首先由各油廠聯合開售，價一律一九〇元，零售商均有購取。續又開中桶熟菜油價一七〇元，大桶一七五元，大德新廠開生菜油價一八〇元，惠民一七五元，生油未聞開出，吉桶小車蔴油以二五〇元開出，交易情况，至爲熟烈。</p>
<p>豆餅交易，昨亦恢復開出，首開現貨價二十一元，繼廠方亦有開出，價格最高二十二元五角，成交約二三千片。</p>
<h3>茶市交易稀少</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，交易仍乏實際，良以市存旣將吿罄，而同時復因自行政院准予寬放限價，實行核本議價後，各物多見軋升，故執主對於握在手中之貨，亦萌不忍輕脫之念，喊價齊步飛升，難獲做開，綜觀此種情形，前途絢爛非凡。</p>
<h3>捲菸業派貨應市</h3>
<p>捲菸工業同業公會以自政府取消限價後，惟恐市銷脫節，及開價過份等情，特於昨日召集緊急理監事會，議決通吿同業，立卽派貨應市。至其派價，若依各項原物料新成太計算，至少需增加百分之二三百，但公會仍本大衆立塲，切實勸吿同業，各菸派價，儘量壓低。同時通知市塲，立卽派貨者，計有華成華明中華福華福新裕華華美南洋頤中大東南等各大公司云。</p>
<h3>中紡昨開始配布　各項色布上漲兩倍弱</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市塲仍未開做，紡建公司之紗布價格，業經主管當局核定，二十支棉紗每包爲一千八百元，較之「八一九」限價上漲一倍半强。</p>
<p>棉布中紡公司已掛牌，照常配售，計特AB十二磅細布，每疋六十二元五角，限（染廠）申購，又四君子元嗶嘰，每疋八十九元三角，限（門市）申購。</p>

<h3>桐油新價做開</h3>
<p>僵擯多時之桐油議價，昨日市上，在同業積極磋商中，驟見展開。足度每擔躍登二二〇元，西洪漲勢較緩，每桶開一七〇元，餘則照此推算，市氣均比前趨挺。而據業中人云：目前瑛口各路產價，依然齊步飛升，聞每擔高做一百七八十元左右，故照此議價，僅能微博蠅利。</p>

<h3>無米</h3>
<p>— 夢秋</p>
<p>這幾天，我更怕看見老洪了。</p>
<p>但是，愈是不希望看見他，却偏是容易碰頭。事實上我們旣然大家都擠在同一個大雜院裏，想迴避也眞難，何况我和他的房間正是遙遙相對。他有肺病，不過我們這宿舍裏有肺病的人多的是，倒不是怕這一層。我最怕的是，他一見了我，總要笑嘻嘻地走過來問：</p>
<p>「老兄，配給米快到了罷？那天好領呢？」</p>
<p>我總是說：『快了，報上說馬上就可以到。』</p>
<p>天天這樣回答着，我心裏總是一陣難受。他何嘗不每天看報？而且，每天一淸早，他就候在門口，等報差的脚踏車一到，馬上就搶着找配米的消息。可是，他偏是要問我。這簡直是磨折我因爲我自己的米也維持不了四五天了。</p>
<p>老洪是一個冷衙門裏的起碼科員，月薪金圓四十八元。你如果看見了他的蒼老的面容，蓬鬆的頭髮，幾天不剃的鬍鬚，你也許會當他是一個抽雅片的中年人的。他的身裁又高，見得背脊骨彎彎的，說話又總是那麼低聲下氣。有時我走過他的房門口，正好房門開着，常看見他躺在牀上，一動不動，連我也不能相信他今年才是一個廿六歲的靑年人。</p>
<p>今春，他的去年新娶的夫人從鄉下出來和他同住時，我們大家都很高興、說老洪可以有一個人照料他了——誰想到，這位幾個月前還很健壯的少婦，却因爲小產後調養得不好，竟弄得像現在這樣面黃肌瘦，病骨支離呢！</p>
<p>這幾天，對老洪的打擊實在太重了。別人在爲了排隊而怨恨，可是我們這一帶却根本沒有一家米店有配給米，爲了吃飯，排隊就排隊吧，隊伍儘管長，祗要有一個隊伍，總還有買到的希望。但是，我們這一區的米店雖然不少，却一總不過有兩家賣過兩個半天的配給米，說「半天」，都不過賣了兩個鐘頭就完了。每人限購五升的米，我們連影子都沒有見過。排隊的人們在怨恨，我們却在羨慕他們還有隊可排！</p>
<p>我們一家有時就上飯店吃東西，反正塞飽肚子就算，也顧不得吃的是些什麼。但是，老洪的夫人却嚴守着量入爲出的主意，守住了老洪的預算……</p>
<p>他們吃大餅，但大餅攤也收歇了。他們吃山芋，但山芋也不容易買到，而且價格也和前幾天大不相同了。</p>
<p>有一個好心的鄰人送給老洪半面盆糙米，她後來說：老洪還是那麼笑嘻嘻的，臉上却淌着眼淚。那個鄰人自己也並不是存着兩斗三斗米的人，回到了家裏，不禁也哭了一塲。</p>
<p>老洪辦公的地方管理得並不嚴緊，可是多請了假照樣要處分，他們的科長還有意無意地對老洪說過，他們的機關快要裁員了。</p>
<p>天知道，老洪不是一個　人！但是，我愈來愈怕他，我怕見他的凄苦的笑容，我怕見他的勉强的「若無其事」的神氣。</p>
<p>因之，今天早上我下了個決心。平日八點三刻出門最容易碰着他，今天我就改爲八點正。</p>
<p>實際上走出門的時候還祗有七點三刻，因爲我也想在附近的小攤上試試運氣，看看會不會吃着一碗陽春麵之類。然而，剛低頭走出門時，耳邊又來了熟悉的聲音：</p>
<p>「老兄，你的消息比我們靈通，配米倒底什麼時候來呢？』</p>
<p>我吃了一驚。抬頭一看，自然是他。然而，奇怪得很，他的憔悴的面上似乎有一絲喜色。</p>
<p>我正想支吾過去，他倒不等我回答，就脫：</p>
<p>「你看，不容易啊！早上四點多鐘就去排隊，買到了這個：……」</p>
<p>他的手裏提着半斤左右灰黑色的生麵。我想勸他保重一點自己的身體，然而喉頭似乎梗住了什麼似的。我笑着勸他快回去吃一碗滾燙的麵好去辦公，他也笑了，笑得一陣陣劇烈的咳嗆，對我揮揮手，我匆匆走了出去。</p>
<p>半斤麵兩個人分，每人四兩，這就是全天的食糧了嗎……想到這裏，我竟然已經走到電車站了。</p>
<h3>輓陳樹人先生</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>江漢風流樽酒間，論交未覺夙緣慳，詩中稱伯平公老，石上傳神蘇子閑（予戲寫墨竹，曾承先生補石）；猶是月明竹林路，無端潮暗荔支灣，秋來不盡人琴感，蟋蟀　堂渺別顏！</p>
<p>緬然海國動哀思，風雨漫天訃吿遲（先生卒於今年十月四日，予於同月八日始接獲廣州陳宅訃吿），一代衣冠推老輩，千秋文物仰高姿；如公自處惟寗靜！舉世何人不擁持？留得雙淸更雙絕，迎年實與送年詩（今正先生自題雙淸圖，有「送年詩與迎年畫」句）。</p>
<h3>憶橫塘</h3>
<p>— 細侯</p>
<p>橫塘是蘇州一小鎭，算不得名勝，只要看旅行團之類並不將它列入游鑒節目就可知道。但也和楓橋一樣，在前人詩詞裘常出風頭，而且似乎和女性沾着關係，於是頗帶幾分脂粉氣。那起源，說得晚一點大約和唐人崔顥「長干曲」的一句「妾住在橫塘」總不無淵源。</p>
<p>跟許多古蹟名勝一般，我也是先從紙面上領略到橫塘情調，才再身歷其境的·就在上次提到的舟過楓橋的傍晚，到橫塘過夜。遠遠地眺過彩雲橋，便看到黃黃的橋亭，亭角的鈴聲，隨風四散。舟人指說這鈴子已非舊物，原來的鈴聲可以響入三十里外的太湖，也被日本人取去了。不知可信否？但這回只聽得設法搜訪寒山寺古鐘，却未聞歸還橫塘古鈴，雖捨小求大，亦不免令人快快。</p>
<p>那一回上橫塘，穿橋而過，橋亭裏供有佛像，香火星熒，所以亭子粉作黃色，爲了彷彿廟牆。兩岸街路狹仄，櫓聲人語，蕭然水鄕。匆匆一宵，並無什麼留戀，倒是後來偶詠宿舍生活，曾有「雨聲滿屋和衣睡，絕似橫塘夜泊時」之句。</p>
<p>橫塘出胥門不遠便可走到，通常則船行的多。一靠近鎭，遠遠幾處烟柱騰起，那是鎭上灰窰在開工。若有好風，也會帶來稀疏的鈴語。接着是黃色渡亭呈現眼底。船進當中橋洞時，抬頭唸一聲「橫塘古渡」四字，彷彿已經讀了許多有關橫塘的詩詞故事似的了。</p>
<p>記得十六年前的春天，跟友人搭「鏜鏜船」（是一種敲小鑼，來攬客的船）玩木凟，船中忽有所見，留下一首點絳唇詞云：「小檝輕舟，問儂可是橫塘住？翠眉無語，直恐凌波去。第幾橋邊，已是分携處。花無主，春風道路，一陣如紅雨。」同游故人早和「翠眉」「紅雨」一齊風流曇散了。</p>
<p>除了掃墓游山順路息脚，特地去訪橫塘是少有的。誰知一三戰啓，陣綫內移，避敵他去，行經橫塘，啊！橫塘已換了面目了。灰窰破攘，烟柱不飛，渡亭依然，香火全滅，河水久渾，船隻稀見，間有人影出沒疏樹敗屋間，景象蕭條，傷心慘目。我只得加快脚步，一瞥而過。今年搜檢敝篋，還發現當時誌感之作「鷓鴣天」云：「一片橫塘漾入詞，不知是淚是胭脂！風波且莫停舟問，妾已無家人迹稀。無限恨，恨誰知？渡頭　語泣多時：夕陽流水非吾有，都付兵歌共馬嘶。」</p>
<p>十二年來，沒有再跡過楓橋，橫塘，更休提天平穹窿諸勝了。昨出胥門，小立橋頭，對着碧水一灣，口吟「橫塘迷小檝，光景近何如」？頗覺悵惘。尤掛念渡頭失去的古鈴，幾時果能和寒山古鐘一同還歸故土，定將泛棹五湖，從烟波浩淼間，來聽取傾訴積悃的琤琮鈴語哩。</p>

<h3>President Weng and Finance Minister Wang Firmly Resign; Executive Yuan to Discuss This Morning</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has scheduled a regular meeting for the morning of the 3rd, during which President Weng Wenhao will report on his resignation and it will be discussed. It is understood that Mr. Weng's determination to resign is extremely firm, and the entire cabinet will resign accordingly. However, as of the evening of the 2nd, there has been no contact among the political committee members regarding this matter. If there is an intention to resign en masse, it will be decided at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 3rd. During his report to the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 2nd, Weng repeatedly declared his resignation and emphasized that economic issues would require the efforts of his successor. Mr. Weng believes that although the purpose of the economic reform supplementary measures passed by the Executive Yuan was to save the current economic crisis, the financial and economic reforms he presided over had completely failed due to the abandonment of price controls. Therefore, he repeatedly submitted his resignation to the President from the 31st and personally requested to resign. The President is still trying to persuade Mr. Weng to stay. Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, who presided over the economic reforms and implemented the new currency system, also requested to resign to Weng on the 31st. To show his determination, Wang has not been to the ministry since the 1st and did not attend the Legislative Yuan report on the 2nd, but was represented by his Vice Minister, Xu Baiyuan. Wang told reporters who visited him on the morning of the 2nd that he hoped the government would decide on a successor for the Finance Minister as soon as possible, and that he himself intended to pursue a teaching career.</p>
<p>Weng Reports to Legislative Yuan; Declares Financial and Economic Reforms a Failure</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The 16th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 2nd, presided over by Speaker Sun. First, the secretariat read out the Executive Yuan's official dispatch in a closed session, stating that the Executive Yuan had received both inquiries from the Legislative Yuan and had paid attention to the current serious financial and economic situation. It had decided to announce four supplementary economic reform measures on October 30th to seek remedies and requested review. However, the members expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of Executive Yuan President Weng and his cabinet members. Zhao Huimo spoke, criticizing the government for abandoning price controls rashly, breaking faith with the people, and said that whether President Weng resigns or not, he should still be held responsible. He should invite President Weng and Finance Minister Wang to report to the Legislative Yuan and answer questions, and not simply "review" the matter. The chairman consulted the members' opinions, and it was passed without objection that President Weng and Finance Minister Wang would be invited to report in the afternoon and be prepared for questioning. Then, at 10 o'clock, the agenda was opened to the public, and the meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock. The meeting continued at 3 PM, with Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao, along with Chief Accountant Xu Kan, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, and Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Zhang Zizhu, attending and making reports. Weng first declared that the financial and economic reforms he had been working on had failed, and he himself had resigned to take responsibility. The expected goals of the financial and economic reforms were ten. Reviewing the results of the implementation since then: (1) Balancing revenue and expenditure failed completely. (2) Retrieving gold, silver, and foreign currency had considerable success. (3) Cracking down on usury. (4) Increasing bank deposits. (5) Handling foreign exchange. Foreign currency deposits. (6) Prohibiting capital flight, etc., all had initial achievements, but all failed later. (7) Stabilizing prices also failed due to the impact of the above-mentioned failures. (8) Encouraging production had no achievements. (9) Increasing foreign trade volume. (10) Increasing overseas remittances, initially achieved remarkable results, but today there is nothing left. The government discovered at the end of September that the various goals were not being achieved as expected and immediately formulated a plan to take steps from October 1st to reasonably adjust the prices of essential goods, open up production loans, improve the treatment of public servants and teachers, increase wages, and increase the prices of state-owned public utilities. However, due to the sudden intensification of the offensive by the northern bandits and the repeated defeats of the national army, the plan could not be implemented as scheduled. After this delay, panic buying broke out in various cities, leading to a complete standstill of production and marketing, and the financial and economic situation was unprecedentedly serious. The main reason for triggering the panic buying was, undoubtedly, inflation. The huge military and political expenditures and the reliance on subsidies to maintain state-owned transportation and public utilities led to a sharp increase in the issuance of Gold Yuan notes. The redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currency also created a large amount of floating capital. The government had adopted various measures to absorb floating capital, such as setting deadlines for commercial firms to increase capital, selling state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet industries, and issuing short-term treasury bills. However, in fact, very little Gold Yuan notes returned to the market, and the effect was minimal. The financial and economic situation continued to deteriorate, leading to the supplementary measures announced on October 30th to seek remedies.</p>
<p>Four Important Tasks for the Future; All Await the Continued Efforts of the Successor</p>
<p>Weng pointed out that the work that must be continued in the future is nothing more than the following: (1) Tighten expenditures as much as possible, (2) Reduce subsidies as much as possible, (3) Absorb floating capital, (4) Effectively support production enterprises and encourage increased exports, so as to make materials abundant, reduce issuance, and restore the credit of the Gold Yuan notes. At this point, Weng reiterated that he himself had resigned, and the effectiveness would depend on the efforts of his successor. He then explained several points of the supplementary economic reform measures. Relaxing price controls was one of the main points of the supplementary measures. Since the government's financial and economic reforms and the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes, floating capital had gradually flooded the market, and the bandits had repeatedly disrupted and destroyed it, leading to market disorder and imbalances in supply and demand. Only in this way could the inflow of materials into the bandit areas be restricted to restore the normal order of industry and commerce. (2) The "cost-plus pricing" method was for local trade associations to propose the prices of various goods, which would be submitted to the local government for verification and implementation based on their costs. (3) Regarding the adjustment of the treatment of civil and military personnel, the principle had been decided, based on the prices of essential goods, but the specific measures had not yet been formulated. (4) The measures to support production enterprises included supplying Japanese reparations goods and machinery, allocating foreign exchange to order foreign raw materials, parts, etc. Weng's report lasted about half an hour, and the members responded with warm applause.</p>
<h3>Guan Jiyu Reports on Grain Administration; Xu Baiyuan Represents Finance Minister Wang in Answering Questions; Legislative Members Criticize Executive Yuan's Missteps</h3>
<p>Guan Jiyu then reported on the grain supply situation. He listed approximate figures to explain that the total amount of military grain, public grain, and ration grain that must be prepared by the central government is about 75 million dan. The sources, in addition to land tax collection and borrowing, can receive about 25 million dan, and the rest must be purchased, including about 6 million dan of remaining public grain purchased by provinces and counties, about 16 million dan entrusted to various provincial governments to handle, and about 26 million dan entrusted to national banks to purchase (about 8 million dan purchased from abroad). Purchasing is quite difficult, but the government is making every effort to do so. Although this year's grain production in various regions is not very abundant, there should not be a grain shortage immediately after the autumn harvest. Reviewing the reasons for grain shortages in various regions, there are three main points: (1) Price controls are too low, leading to hoarding due to panic buying, (2) Various regions prohibit grain from leaving the region, and the source of the rice market is not smooth, (3) Materials cannot be exchanged, and farmers and grain households are unwilling to sell. The supplementary measures have stipulated that grain can be freely transported and sold at market prices, which can eliminate these three reasons for grain shortages and eliminate the temporary man-made grain shortage. After Guan's report, the members questioned why Finance Minister Wang Yunwu refused to attend. President Weng then ordered Xu Baiyuan to explain on his behalf. Xu stated that Minister Wang had resigned to President Weng the day before yesterday and therefore did not attend the invitation. Regarding the implementation of financial and economic reforms, President Weng had given a detailed report, and he was willing to answer any questions on behalf of Minister Wang. Then the questioning began. The members who spoke included Huang Yuanbin, Huang Jianzhong, Li Yunliang, Zhao Huimo, Wen Shiyuan, Chen Mingxian, Song Shuciao, etc. However, there were more criticisms of the Executive Yuan's mistakes and speeches of personal opinions, and fewer questions were raised. Huang Yuanbin advocated making good use of the retrieved gold, silver, and foreign currency to reverse the crisis. Huang Jianzhong and Zhao Huimo both emphasized that the Jardine Matheson case should be investigated and questioned. Why did the government collect gold banknotes and not target wealthy families but take away the savings of small and medium-sized producers? Zhao Huimo also advocated that the President should announce to the people of the country that the financial deficit in the future would be completely offset by the property of wealthy families to suppress the expansion of issuance and stabilize the people's hearts. Chen Mingxian questioned how to compensate the people for the losses suffered since the financial and economic reforms, from price controls to the cancellation of price controls, how to correct the greater concentration of wealth, and how to fairly and reasonably conclude the cases of innocent merchants who were detained by the Special Criminal Court. Song Shuciao pointed out that the system was wrong, and the Executive Yuan, as a responsible cabinet, was not responsible to the Legislative Yuan. Everything was decided by the President, which was the root cause of all failures and mistakes. The questioning lasted until 5:50 PM, and there were still 15 members who had not had the opportunity to speak. Speaker Sun consulted the members' opinions and proposed to stop the questioning and let President Weng answer orally. Weng said that he did not intend to answer immediately, and some members also advocated "no need to answer." The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency San Francisco, 2nd United Press] Lapham, Director of the China Division of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, recently described the overall situation in China as quite bleak and warned that the United States must extend the Cold War to China to defeat the Communist Party. Earlier, the mayor of San Francisco said that if the United States abandons China, it would not be in the best interest of the United States, and China is one of the most important parts of Asia. He said that the fall of Shenyang does not mean that the Communist Party has won the civil war. Lapham also said that if the Communist Party controls China, any government it establishes will not be friendly to the United States. Our current middle-ground policy toward China is no longer applicable.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 1st Dispatch] Mr. Plitt, who will represent the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation of Congress to China, is tasked with investigating the progress of the aid to China plan and consulting with President Chiang Kai-shek on the military situation in China.

After Plitt returns to Washington around Christmas, he will provide Dewey with full intelligence obtained from on-the-spot investigations so that he can formulate a plan for China after January 20. Bridges' committee will ask China why it has not yet received military aid from the United States and why U.S. aid to China has been delayed. Today, all newspapers reported that the first batch of "large-scale" military supplies to China will be shipped within two days, which was apparently conveyed after our representatives here and the U.S. Army recently reached a final agreement. A senior senator said that the United States charges "the highest prices" when selling arms to China, while other countries only accumulate 20% of the original price when purchasing goods from the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 1st Dispatch] U.S. diplomats said that since the surrender of Japan, China has received more than $2 billion in loans and aid from the United States, one-third of which is military aid. The total amount of aid for this year has been sharply reduced. Congress approved a military aid to China plan of $125 million this year. The State Department announced that China used another $5 million of the $125 million in military aid, leaving $15 million. Most of the equipment has been purchased and is awaiting shipment. The U.S. government and the Chinese Embassy will not disclose the types of military equipment to be shipped under the accelerated order. It is reported that it includes small arms.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Northeast, China, Asia, the World</h3>
<p>-- Welcoming Mr. Paulitz to China Again --</p>
<p>Mr. Still, a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune, interviewed President Chiang Kai-shek in Beiping the day before yesterday, asking about the importance of China in the world's anti-communist struggle, China's position in another world war, and the impact on the world situation if the Communists unfortunately controlled China. President Chiang replied solemnly, not only pointing out the close relationship between the Northeast problem and the world crisis, but also saying: "China is working hard to suppress the Communists, eliminating powerful factors that threaten world peace and preventing the outbreak of a third world war." "The traditional strategy of the Communist International to carry out world revolution, and its current direction of expansion, both take Asia as their main target, and China is the decisive point for the future of Asia. The Communist creed is that to control the world, you must first control Asia, and to control Asia, you must first control China. I can assert that if China is controlled by the Communists, the Third World War will inevitably break out, causing humanity to suffer another tragic disaster."</p>
<p>President Chiang's remarks to the American reporter fully demonstrate that the President not only has a correct understanding of the world situation, but also has keen insight. Therefore, Chinese and foreign newspapers and magazines have uniformly published them, and readers are full of admiration for the President's true knowledge and foresight. Recalling seventeen years ago, when the Japanese warlords launched the September 18th Incident and seized our Northeast by force. Although the diplomatic authorities of the great powers, such as US Secretary of State Stimson, called for a "non-recognition" policy, no one recognized that this was the starting point for Japan's conquest of the world, or the signal for the Second World War. China was left to struggle alone. Before long, it eventually evolved into a Second World War that spread throughout the world, and they suddenly realized that the Second World War originated in Northeast China. Unfortunately, mankind is still forgetful. Even with the great talent and strategy of the late US President Roosevelt, at the end of the victory of the war, he ignored this painful lesson. The arrangement of the Yalta Conference on the Northeast problem left a root of disaster for our Northeast problem! Since the end of the war, the endless wars in the Northeast in the past three years, to the point of creating a situation similar to the "September 18th" incident today, are all caused by a wrong move. Unfortunately, this new crisis has been neglected by the world, so that although the United States has sometimes issued intermittent calls for "aid to China" in the past two or three years, it has not seen any timely emergency action. Now that this crisis has been pointed out frankly by President Chiang, it should awaken the diplomatic authorities of the great powers to be particularly vigilant about Asia, right?</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, the so-called "Truman Doctrine" and the so-called "Marshall Plan" all have anti-communism as their consistent goal. Especially in the "Cold War" between the great powers and the Soviet Union, they are doing their best to exert their full strength. The "North Atlantic Anti-Communist Alliance," which has been sung loudly recently, seems to be even more impressive, but when we look at the anti-communist struggle in the past year, we cannot help but say that "we are retreating step by step and lagging behind." In the problem of the Berlin Blockade, we have seen the firm stance of the Western Allies, but the "Europe first, Asia later" strategy has been used by the Communist forces, starting with Southeast Asia, making all Southeast Asian countries threatened by the Communist forces. The line of sight of the Communist International then shifted to Northeast Asia. The outbreak of the rebellion in South Korea and the complete fall of our Northeast into the hands of the Communists are enough to prove that Northeast Asia will also be controlled by the Communist International. Looking again at the US policy toward China after the war, the US government has adopted a policy of aid in principle, and has assisted China economically and militarily from time to time, but the quantity and timing of aid have become problems, giving people the feeling of "a drop in the bucket" and "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." If this policy error is not remedied as soon as possible, the crisis in the Far East may not be saved, and one day it will endanger the peace of the entire world!</p>
<p>There is no shortage of wise and talented people in the United States, especially Mr. Paulitz and Mr. Chow I-te, who have long seen the growing crisis in the Far East and believe that the current US policy toward China may create a historical mistake. They have spared no effort to run around and appeal, urging the US government and the public to face reality, raise awareness, and quickly step up aid to China. After returning to the country from his previous trip to China, Mr. Paulitz published an article entitled "Impressions of My Visit to China," which was righteous and solemn and was circulated by concerned people around the world, not only deeply concerned by the Chinese people. Now that Mr. Paulitz has been ordered by Congress to come to China again to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of China's political situation and diagnose the crisis in Asia, it is worthy of our special attention and warm welcome. However, because the time is urgent, it has reached a critical moment, and everything must be done quickly. We hope that Mr. Paulitz will come to China as soon as possible, so that he can bring the real situation in Asia back to the country as soon as possible, so that the US government and the public can pay special attention to the crisis in the Northeast, China, Asia, and the world, and never again treat the Chinese government's suppression of bandits and pacification of chaos as China's internal affairs, nor stubbornly adhere to the established idea of "Europe first, Asia later," allowing the power of the communist totalitarian state to spread throughout China and Asia, so that it is too late to regret!</p>
<h3>Senior Chinese Seafarer Organizations Write to the U.S. Ambassador, Opposing the Promotion of Japanese Aviation Industry, Responding to the Claims of the U.S. Shipping Association</h3>
<p>[News from our Newspaper] According to Jiang Keni, an executive of the Federation of Senior Chinese Merchant Seafarer Organizations: Because the US government has adopted an active support policy, Japan will soon realize its ideal of 4 million tons of new ships. Currently, Japan is actively building new ships, and a certain shipyard has already started building 19 merchant ships. This trend is a great threat to the Chinese shipping industry, and it is hoped that people who care about the construction of the Chinese shipping industry will pay attention to it. It is learned that five senior seafarer organizations, in response to the US shipping industry's opposition to supporting the Japanese aviation industry, sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart last month, requesting the US government to restrict the Japanese aviation industry. The original letter is as follows: To His Excellency Ambassador Stuart: According to the report of the Johnston Investigation Group of your country, the Japanese aviation industry can restore its 1930 to 1934 standards. In other words, your country will allow Japan to restore 4 million tons of merchant ships and re-establish its aggressive forces. This move poses a great threat to the Allied countries in the Far East, especially China, which, after the victory, has failed to embark on the road of construction due to various factors. However, the enemy who first invaded Chinese territory, massacred the Chinese people, and destroyed the tonnage of Chinese ships is rapidly restoring its overwhelming superiority in dominating the Far East under the support of your country. This cannot but cause an extraordinarily unfavorable reaction among the people of our country in terms of both fact and psychology. Our associations, in shipping circles, both labor and management, have successively lodged protests against this, and other countries such as Australia, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union have also made solemn opposition to your country's excessively pro-Japanese policy, which I believe is well understood. Now, reading the protest documents of the American Shipping Association, which represents more than two-thirds of your country's shipping industry, against the Johnston report, its reasons and its long-term vision are deeply admirable. It can be seen that justice still exists in the world. We are writing to your Excellency the Ambassador again, requesting that you forward to your country's government that the restoration of the Japanese aviation industry should still be based on the standard of making it only usable for domestic trade and its nearby islands. Otherwise, it will constitute a threat to peace in the Far East and endanger world peace and tranquility. We hope that you will give your attention to this matter. Initiated by: Chinese Merchant Ship Masters Association, Chinese Maritime Masters Federation, Chinese Marine Engineers Association, Chinese Ship Wireless Telegraphists Association, Songhan Area Pilot Association.</p>

<h3>He Yingqin and Badawei Leave Shanghai After Inspecting the National Defense Medical College</h3>
<p>Returned to Nanjing by the same plane yesterday afternoon</p>
<p>[News from our Newspaper] Minister of National Defense He Yingqin flew from Nanjing to Shanghai by special plane yesterday morning to inspect the Jiangwan National Defense Medical College. Among those who came with him were Badawei, head of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group to China, and Lin Kesheng, director of the Military Medical Department and president of the National Defense Medical College.

He was very pleased that the college was able to produce orange mildew to replace penicillin. He also deeply appreciated the college's efforts to produce plasma, dissolve DDT, study the extraction of soybeans to make them the simplest and most nutritious universal food for the troops, and the ideal level of the faculty. At 11:00, he convened a meeting with all faculty, staff, and students, and Minister He pointed out that at least 50,000 military doctors should be deployed among our country's existing 5 million troops in order to maintain a high level of combat effectiveness at all times, but currently there are only about 2,000 military medical personnel serving in the military, and the total number of registered doctors in the country is only about 15,000, so military doctors need to be trained in large numbers. He also explained the importance of the status of military medical personnel in today's national defense, and encouraged all members of the college that in addition to having the academic knowledge, skills, and morality that doctors should have, they should also cultivate the personality, spirit, and discipline that soldiers should have. They should study hard at the college and advance and retreat with the combat troops in the future, sharing life and death, in order to achieve our country's goal of cultivating military doctors and building military medicine. After the speech, the party had lunch at the college and went to Qimei Road and Nanshi to inspect the hygiene material warehouse at four o'clock. He returned to Nanjing by the same plane.</p>

Unless the election result is very close, the trend should be clear before midnight. Truman will vote in his hometown of Independence, Missouri, at 11 AM Eastern Standard Time. He has decided to go to bed early on the 2nd and not wait to see if the election is decided. However, his secretary, Ross, said that Truman may be awakened in the evening if necessary. Dewey will vote at a public school at 121 East 5th Street in New York and then return to the Republican headquarters at the Roosevelt Hotel to await the election results. Dewey is the only presidential candidate listed on the ballots of every state in the country. Truman lost Alabama, where the Democratic name and symbol were taken by the States' Rights faction. States' Rights candidate Thurmond is listed on the ballots of thirteen states. Progressive Party candidate Wallace is on the ballot in forty-five states, and Socialist Party candidate Thomas is on the ballot in thirty-one states. The votes for the States' Rights, Progressive, and Socialist parties are all likely to dilute Truman's strength. Dewey has a good chance of winning Florida and Tennessee, two Democratic strongholds in the South. Voters will also elect thirty-two senators, four hundred and thirty-two representatives, thirty-two governors, and countless minor officials.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] President Truman broke the tradition of a political truce on the eve of the election by broadcasting to the nation from his hometown of Independence, attacking Dewey and the Republican Party. Dewey believes that he will win when the election results are revealed at midnight on the 2nd (1 PM on the 3rd, Shanghai time). In his final campaign speech, he urged the American people to vote enthusiastically and called on the Republican and Democratic parties to unite after the election results are announced. But Truman almost rejected this call in his broadcast, saying that the election on the 2nd would be a choice between the peace and prosperity of a Democratic government and the war and depression of a Republican government.</p>
<h3>The Main Duel Between the Two Major American Parties is for Control of the Senate; Republican Victory is Not Guaranteed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 1st] Public opinion polls generally predict that the Republican Party will maintain a majority of forty to fifty seats in the House of Representatives, thus controlling the House. But the main duel will be for control of the Senate. The current Senate includes fifty-one Republicans and forty-five Democrats. However, the terms of thirty-two members (seventeen Republicans and fifteen Democrats) expire this year. Therefore, both parties must compete for their members' re-election. On the day of this election, no pollster dares to predict with certainty that the Republican Party will win in the Senate election.</p>
<p>Another public opinion poll stated that the Senate would be evenly divided between the two parties, with each occupying forty-eight seats. If the Senate is so formed, the Vice President would have the decisive vote on legislative matters. This year's American election is of great importance to foreign relations. Therefore, the State Department's "Voice of America" will report the election results in sixteen languages tomorrow night.</p>
<h3>Truman Feels He Will No Longer Be Master of the White House</h3>
<p>Compares the White House to the Best Prison in the World</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kansas City, 1st] If the public opinion polls in the United States are correct, Dewey will be elected the 33rd President of the United States tomorrow, and President Truman will be released from the White House, which he considers the best prison in the world. Truman said at a banquet here tonight: "You all know that the President of the United States is the most important prisoner in the world, and the White House is the best prison in the world." President Truman may have anticipated that he will no longer be the hardworking master of the White House for four years.</p>
<h3>Entire New York City Police Force Mobilized to Assist in Election</h3>
<p>Stock Market Consistently Firm</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] The entire New York City police force of eighteen thousand two hundred and thirty-two officers was specially mobilized for the election on the 2nd. At 6 AM, two thousand two hundred detectives were already on duty, expelling all undesirable elements so that they could not remain on the streets. Police Commissioner Wallender ordered strict prevention of accidents.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] On the eve of the American election, the New York stock market was consistently firm. Most brokers hoped that a Republican victory would lead to the modification of some of the Democratic government's trading restrictions. These restrictions are intended to prevent a recurrence of the economic collapse of 1929.</p>
<h3>Progressive Party to be Tested Amidst American Election</h3>
<p>Feared That It Cannot Obtain a Single District Vote</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] Wallace's new Progressive Party will face its first major test at the polling places on the 2nd. According to pre-election predictions, Wallace may not be able to obtain a single district electoral vote. As for the popular vote, it is estimated to be around two million. Wallace has been working hard until the day of the election, but he has never mentioned how many votes he may get. On the contrary, he has repeatedly declared that the party will maintain its existence.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly to Hold Plenary Meeting Today to Discuss Atomic Energy Control; All Parties Quietly Await End of US Election</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 1st] The United Nations Political Committee will resume discussions on the Greek issue on the 2nd. However, the world's top diplomats are all awaiting the results of the US election. The Political Committee plans to meet all day to conclude the general debate and produce concrete action. The UN General Assembly also plans to hold a plenary session on the 3rd to consider a final decision on the atomic energy stalemate. It is reported that most delegates are prepared to support the US atomic energy control plan.</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly will also discuss a resolution passed by the Political Committee, despite Soviet opposition. This resolution requires the five great powers and Canada to discuss the possibility of an agreement on atomic energy issues and submit a report to the next General Assembly. The Security Council will study the Palestinian issue on the 4th, marking the first test of American diplomacy after the election. The Security Council will consider a proposal from China and the United Kingdom, mainly to order the Arab and Jewish sides to return to their original positions before the outbreak of war on October 14, and to order the Jewish side to abandon the occupied areas. If one side refuses, the resolution will impose sanctions. The US delegation originally supported the Sino-British proposal, but President Truman's direct intervention caused the US to withdraw its support. There is no sign of what the US position will be after the election. The UN General Assembly delegates are extremely concerned about the US election and believe that if the Republican Party wins, there will be some changes in the US delegation's strategy. However, general American foreign policy will not change. On the other hand, if Truman wins, US policy will consistently intensify and there will be some important changes to end the main debate. Secretary of State Marshall returned here from London on the 1st. Dulles, who may become Dewey's Secretary of State, also returned to Paris after touring the Scandinavian countries over the weekend. It is believed that both Marshall and Dulles have drafted methods so that domestic reports can be quickly transmitted here.</p>
<h3>Shaw Comments on Stalin's Speech; Does Not Believe Soviets Will Initiate War</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] George Bernard Shaw wrote in the British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" that "Stalin's frank and clear speech last week was a breath of fresh air. British newspapers do not understand the meaning of communism, so their actions are strange. Their aimless attacks on their opponents are just like unreasonable people in the suburbs throwing dead cats at each other over a garden wall. One dead cat is called totalitarianism, another is called a police state, and the third is called defending against Soviet aggression. But the ruthless fact is that these dead cats are all thrown from our side. What Stalin fears most is another imperialist war. He is too busy with domestic rule to have time for impossible military conquest and world annexation." Shaw continued, saying that the Soviet totalitarianism and police state that the West accuses them of are now flourishing in the British Commonwealth. Although we attack the so-called secret police, we have not therefore abolished our country's Criminal Investigation Department and Police Department.</p>

<h3>Our Country Holds a Cautious Attitude Towards Concluding a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan, Leaving Out the Soviet Union; Experts Believe the Focus Should Be on Sino-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the American report that Republican foreign policy may consider concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan, leaving out the Soviet Union, senior officials in Nanjing's political circles have remained silent. Only one expert on foreign affairs stated that this issue should be approached with caution. The government should conduct a detailed study of the following issues: (1) the past and future of Sino-Soviet relations; (2) whether the Soviet Union's policy towards Japan is in line with our interests; (3) what are the actual advantages and disadvantages of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan, leaving out the Soviet Union; (4) the development of the overall world situation. After weighing these factors, a clear attitude should be adopted.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Tribunal to Reconvene Tomorrow; War Criminals Tojo and Others to be Sentenced</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] It was announced on the 2nd that the Eleven-Nation International Military Tribunal for the Far East will reconvene on the 4th at the former Japanese Ministry of Defense building to announce the verdicts regarding Tojo and twenty-four other Class A war criminals. The Far East Military Tribunal has been adjourned for nearly half a year, during which time the judges from various countries have meticulously studied the approximately nine million words of evidence and arguments collected during the trial. According to unofficial estimates, the trial will continue for at least ten days or so before the final verdict is announced. Some estimators even estimate that it will take several weeks, as they estimate that at least 2,500 pages of documents will be mentioned during the trial, and only about 200 pages can be mentioned during each day's trial time. It is generally expected that the defendants' lawyers will request MacArthur to reduce the sentences after the verdict, as MacArthur, in his position as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, is the final reviewing authority. There is currently no prediction as to when the sentences will be carried out after they are pronounced.</p>

<h3>Mayor Summons Representatives from Rice, Grain, and Other Industries; Listens to Reports on Price Adjustments; Advises Against Seeking Excessive Profits; Orders Resumption of Transactions Starting Today; Meat and Vegetable Industries Indicate Prices Will Definitely Fall</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu summoned the chairmen of the industry associations for daily necessities such as rice, oil, flour, fresh meat, vegetables, and miscellaneous grains to the municipal government office at 4 PM yesterday for discussions. He inquired about the adjustment multiples for the prices of various items after the lifting of price controls, and earnestly advised them not to raise prices excessively or seek excessive profits. Registered inventory should be sold at lower prices, and they should not adopt a wait-and-see attitude. He ordered them to resume trading starting today and to supply the market needs as much as possible. Those who were summoned to the municipal government yesterday included Wan Molin from the rice industry, Zhen Hua, Xi Debing from the flour industry, Rong Yiren, Hong Wenjiang from the pig industry, Zhu Gao from the fresh meat industry, Zhang Chao from the oil industry, Chuan Changyu from the miscellaneous grains industry, and Ma Wenbiao from the vegetable industry. According to Zhu Zhigao, chairman of the Fresh Meat Industry Association, fresh meat can be supplied as much as possible starting today. The agreed new price is about 3.5 yuan per catty, and will definitely not exceed 4 yuan. The rumors of 5-6 yuan per catty yesterday were not the official market price, but were raised by individual transporters from other places seeking profit. He also guaranteed that meat prices could fall to within 3 yuan per catty within two weeks after the sources became smooth.</p>
<p>Rong Yiren from the flour industry said that the price of flour has also been agreed upon, with a factory price of 30 yuan per bag and a retail price of about 34 yuan. Supplies have been gradually available since yesterday. The city's daily flour demand is about 11,000 dan. Yesterday, the supply was over 6,000 dan, and efforts will be made to gradually increase it. However, factories have been shut down for half a month, and it will take about a week to fully restore the original state.</p>
<p>Vegetable industry representative Ma Wenbiao said that vegetable prices have been inconsistent in the past two days and there is no fixed price. Mayor Wu instructed him to tell the vendors not to raise prices. The industry association does not have this real power, but it intends to inform the mutual aid association of vegetable vendors to convey the message. He believes that yesterday's vegetable prices cannot be taken as a standard, because the prices were raised due to the scarcity of goods. He is confident that vegetable prices will definitely fall after the internal sources are cleared.</p>
<p>According to Zhen Hua of the rice industry, the market price of rice is 90 yuan per dan. Whether the new price is stable depends on the rice source situation, because the price of rice in the market must be determined based on the prices in the producing areas. If the source is abundant, the rice price will not rise. However, the rice shops in the city have suffered heavy losses due to the 819 price control policy, and their capital is weak. The rice industry association has submitted a document to the municipal government yesterday, requesting relief. Mayor Wu has promised to consider it. The rice merchant representatives also requested the municipal government to guarantee transactions after resumption of business. Mayor Wu has ordered the police to protect the legitimate transactions of rice shops.</p>
<p>After meeting with the representatives of various industries, Mayor Wu met with reporters in the office at 5:30 PM to report on the discussions and answer various questions from newspaper reporters, including: (1) To control prices, a price negotiation committee will be organized, which is being prepared by the Social Affairs Bureau. (2) After the price negotiation is implemented, the citizen purchase certificates to be distributed on the 8th of this month will not guarantee the supply of materials. (3) The adjustment of prices for public utilities will be determined after the calculation of coal, raw materials, and labor costs is completed. (4) Whether the adjustment of employee benefits will still use the cost of living index will be decided by the central government.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Allowed Free Trade; Industrial Raw Material Pricing; Social Affairs Bureau Temporarily Sets Ten Kinds; Prices of Some Items Have Been Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Own Correspondent] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct the industry associations to promptly negotiate prices and open for business, and no longer wait and see. The daily necessities originally stipulated by the Social Affairs Bureau for price negotiation were soybean oil, woolen cloth, woolen yarn stacks, kerosene, coal briquettes, cigarettes, matches and soap, a total of eight kinds. Now it has been decided to change cigarettes to free trade and replace it with economic meals, still a total of eight kinds. Other items not specified for price negotiation can be negotiated by various industries and reported to the bureau for record, without approval, and free trade is allowed. As for industrial raw materials to be priced, the bureau has temporarily set ten kinds, including sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, butter, rosin, cowhide, factory silk, dyes, and rubber, and instructed the industry associations to negotiate a cost table based on production or import costs and report it for verification. Relevant industry associations may send representatives to attend the price negotiation. For raw materials with many items, the main ones will be priced, and the rest will be approved with reference to that standard.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the adjustment of prices, including an increase of 150% in hospital consultation fees. The book industry increased prices by 150%. The negotiated price of soybean oil was also determined to be adjusted from 60 yuan to 190 yuan, an increase of slightly less than 220%. Also, the film and theater industries were approved to increase prices by 150% the day before yesterday, but it was not implemented yesterday, and will be adjusted starting today.</p>
<h3>Employees' Cigarettes; Ordered to be Rationed at Fair Prices</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The Social Affairs Bureau originally approved an increase of 200% in the price of cigarettes yesterday morning, but because the price of cigarettes in Hangzhou and other places had risen to about 600-700 million before, the news spread, and the cigarette shops were snapped up. The Dakang shop in Nanshi was even beaten and suffered losses. At noon, the cigarette industry and the Commercial Industry Association went to the Social Affairs Bureau again to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation. Director Wu decided that in addition to the cigarettes needed by the city's 1.2 million employees, which must be rationed by the cigarette merchants at fair prices, the rest will be allowed to be negotiated by the industry itself at any time according to market needs, and the Social Affairs Bureau will temporarily not control it.</p>
<h3>Materials Adjustment Committee Resolves; Factory Finished Products; Joint Distribution</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Own Correspondent] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee held its tenth meeting at 11 AM yesterday, chaired by Chairman Liu Gongyun. First, Director Wu Kaixian reported on the price trends in Shanghai, and the heads of the competent authorities of rice, coal, and yarn separately reported on the adjustment of various materials. At the same time, the issue of how to coordinate the adjustment of materials in the future after the promulgation of the supplementary financial measures was raised. The most important decision at yesterday's meeting was that in order to stabilize prices at present, joint distribution must be adopted, and the finished products of each factory should be handled by the relevant industry associations. In this way, price negotiation can be implemented without the occurrence of black markets. In addition, there were also concrete decisions on the planning of industrial coal.</p>

According to the interview, he had been at sea for 38 days and was isolated from the world, so he hoped not to be asked about national affairs and world politics. However, a reporter still asked whether the British Consulate was preparing to evacuate British overseas Chinese in North China. He replied that there was no such plan and no such preparation at all. When talking about his impression of Shanghai, he said that he had heard many surprising news about the shortage of food here before coming to Shanghai, but when the ship arrived at the port, he saw chimneys standing on both sides of the Huangpu River, with black smoke billowing. The streets were lined with shops, proving that this is a thriving industrial and commercial city.

Before coming to China, Mr. Oka was the minister of the British Embassy in Washington.</p>

<h3>The Heavenly Palace Theater Martial Arts Drama: Two Tourists Stabbed</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] At the Heavenly Palace Theater on Central Tibet Road, at approximately 9:30 PM last night, tourist Lu Yongkang, along with friends Yu Zhongbiao, Ding Chungen, and Wang Baosheng, were watching a play when a friend invited Lu outside for a conversation.

<h3>Attending the International Air Transport Conference: Liu Jingyi's Return to China and Remarks - Rapid Progress in Western European Civil Aviation, High Demand for Chinese Tea and Carpets</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, has returned to Shanghai from the 4th International Air Transport Association Conference and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:10 PM. According to Mr. Liu's statement to reporters: (1) This conference was held in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss international air transport safety, passenger convenience, and how to simplify accounting procedures among various airlines. (2) The general productivity of various Western European countries has surpassed pre-war levels, and civil aviation has made particularly rapid progress. For example, the number of personnel at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has increased from 2,000 to 14,000 in the past two and a half years, and the number of aircraft has increased to 100. Similarly, the SAS airline, formed through cooperation between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, has increased its staff to 6,000 and its aircraft to 63. In contrast, the state of civil aviation in our country leaves no room for complacency. (3) Americans regard travel as a necessary condition for life, spending as much as two billion US dollars annually on trips to Europe. Western European countries are competing fiercely for air traffic in order to attract tourists and earn foreign exchange. In addition to emphasizing equipment, they also pay great attention to passenger convenience. Currently, most countries no longer require visas for passports. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France no longer require passports due to mutual benefit. Although other countries still require visas, the procedures and time have been simplified as much as possible. As a result, the number of tourists to Europe has increased significantly recently, and regardless of trips to the United States or the Far East, reservations must be made two months in advance. (4) Mr. Liu also stated that various foreign friends he contacted in Europe inquired about why our country's special products, Tianjin carpets, have not been seen in European and American markets since the war. In addition, Turkey currently has a strong demand for tea. If our country's tea is transported there, at least 1,500 tons can be sold immediately. He hopes that our country's exporters will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Price Controls Lifted - Significant Losses: Edible Oil Retailers Petitioned Yesterday - Requesting Oil Factories to Allocate Goods According to Price Controls</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Oil Trade Association sent representatives to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday. According to them, edible oil retailers had a total of 50,000 dan of oil in stock on August 19th. Later, they complied with the authorities' orders to sell the oil to citizens at controlled prices based on their national identification cards. All 50,000 dan of edible oil were sold out. Now, the authorities are planning for manufacturers to allocate goods to retailers, but the price controls have suddenly been lifted, and prices have risen threefold. Retailers have suffered greatly, losing three-quarters of their stock in value. However, the 200,000 dan of edible oil stored by manufacturers have not been touched. Therefore, they request the Bureau of Social Affairs to order manufacturers to allocate 40,000 dan at controlled prices to compensate for the retailers' losses.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Invites Various Sectors - Discussing Wage Issues - Labor and Management Unanimously Advocate - Restoring the Wage Indexing Method - Jointly Requesting Central Government Approval for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, invited representatives from various industrial and commercial sectors to the bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss wage issues following the lifting of price controls.

They requested the Bureau of Social Affairs to adopt this proposal. It was decided to send the above opinions to the central government for adoption and implementation, and representatives from the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union immediately drafted a telegram to the central government, requesting approval. The original telegram is as follows: "To Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan and Minister Gu Jun of the Ministry of Social Affairs, we have gratefully received the Supplementary Measures for Economic Control, Section C, Article 2, which stipulates that wages should be adjusted according to the needs of maintaining workers' livelihoods, reflecting deep compassion for the difficulties of workers. After discussions in winter, everyone agreed that workers' salaries should still be based on August 19th, compiling a cost-of-living index and calculating and issuing salaries from November onwards, and making it public, which is more reasonable and avoids disputes. In addition to requesting the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to adopt this proposal, we respectfully send this telegram seeking your approval. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union, in winter."</p>

<h3>Female Teacher Shen Ou and Eight Others - Indicted for Illegal Activities</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Shen Ou (also known as Lin Jiamin, Lin Huinian, Chen Caoping, with the nickname A-zai), a female teacher at the Huamo Girls' Middle School in this city, secretly contacted Lin Zheng, Zhu Juemin, Wang Yinming, Wang Fuyuan, and others, who were responsible for communicating with communist bandits hiding in Shanghai. She enticed unemployed workers and students to join the Communist Party.

<h3>Zhang Yamin Entangles Girlfriend - Wang Huiheng Attempts Suicide and is Rescued - Has Been Suffering from Mental Stimulation and厭厭厭厌 For a Long Time</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Huiheng, a famous female singer in this city who was repeatedly mentioned in the will of Zhang Yamin, who was previously executed for the case, and said to be his only confidante, suddenly swallowed a large number of sleeping pills on the night of the 31st of last month and attempted suicide. She was discovered and rescued, but due to severe poisoning, she was still in danger as of last night. According to Wang's father, Wang Zhunchen, the motive for Wang's suicide was already revealed in Zhang Yamin's will. When Zhang's wife published an advertisement seeking Wang's photo, Wang's family saw that she looked depressed and sad all day long. At first, they did not pay attention. Later, Wang often wrote poems and songs, full of sorrow. Recently, she took several artistic photos and asked her relatives and friends: "Which one is most suitable for my posthumous portrait?" They realized that she was gradually revealing her desire to die. On the evening of the 29th of last month, Wang still went to the Bilo Hotel for dinner with her family. During the dinner, she sang sentimental lines from the Cheng School opera. On the night of the 31st, her father got up and went to her bedroom, intending to make a precautionary visit, but he found that the doors had been locked tightly. After trying to break into the room, he found that her face was pale, and empty boxes of sleeping pills were scattered all over the floor next to her pillow. According to the investigation, these pills were the most potent pain-relieving sleeping pills. Wang had been gradually buying and hoarding more than 100 pills beforehand. She swallowed 40 pills at once, which proves that her desire to die was extremely strong. In her will, in addition to requesting that she be buried in the Hongqiao Cemetery after her death, she also said: "Superior environment and material enjoyment cannot slightly reduce mental stimulation... Life is like a drama. I never thought that I would be playing a short Cheng School opera..." In addition, she also left 46 posthumous poems, which are even more full of the desire to die. According to Wang's father, Wang Zhunchen has only this one daughter and loves her very much. Wang often took her to social occasions, but because she was silent and寡言, she never had a boyfriend. Although Zhang Yamin had met her several times, it was only a superficial friendship, and Wang was not yet twenty years old, so her father was unwilling to discuss marriage for her. After Wang's suicide attempt, Wang Zhunchen and his wife fainted several times. Currently, because the toxins in her nerves and brain marrow have not been cleared, Wang Ting has asked five or six famous doctors in the city to do their best to rescue her.</p>
<p>The photo of Zhang Yamin returned, taken in the Huangjia Garden.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jingguo Reviews Economic Control Work - Sorrowfully Points Out Reasons for Price Control Failure</h3>
<p>When Jiang Jingguo, Economic Control Supervisor of the Shanghai District, gathered the Suppression Construction Brigade and the Youth Service Corps members for training at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, he reviewed the economic control work of the past two months and sorrowfully pointed out that the failure of the price control policy was due to everyone's inability to remain calm. There is no such thing as a harvest without paying a price in the world. The price control policy requires everyone to endure temporary pain in order to seek long-term stability in the lives of the majority of people. Although some people feel relieved to give up price controls today, the threat of high prices is felt by the majority of people, and it is unknown where it will end. However, Mr. Jiang resolutely and calmly claimed that giving up price controls does not mean giving up the fight against unscrupulous merchants. If anyone breaks the law, we will catch unscrupulous merchants every day that we are in Shanghai. He shouted a slogan: "The power of justice must unite today, and we believe that Shanghai will eventually belong to the youth of justice." Mr. Jiang's entire speech was impassioned and full of enthusiasm, and the thousands of young people who listened were greatly moved. He encouraged the young comrades not to be discouraged by setbacks and reviewed the work of the past 70 days. He deeply felt that the newly emerging forces were not yet mature and 反動勢九 had formed a line, colluding with each other, because they deeply feared that "if new forces rise, there will be no place for them." We have high emotions and open minds, but we still lack the experience to fight and are not enough to deal with cunning economic enemies. However, our policies are not wrong. For the country, there can be no individuals; for the sake of the majority of people, we cannot take care of the interests of a minority. We have no shame in our policies towards the country and the people. Therefore, the 70 days of hard work were not in vain. We have paid the price. The people may not fully know it today, but they will surely know in the future that the Suppression Construction Brigade and the Youth Service Corps members did not take a single cent from the people of Shanghai and wholeheartedly served the people. Mr. Jiang continued: The people are our masters. In any case, faithful servants must continue to work hard and serve tirelessly. The difference between us and the bureaucrats is that they are doing it to be officials, while we are doing it to serve. What he deeply laments is that the people could not remain calm when economic controls were gradually implemented. He said that we were not acting recklessly, but were planned and methodical. The raw materials that we purchased from abroad will arrive this month. Because the supply of rice is not smooth, it has been decided to exchange cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and sugar for grain with Jiaxing, Qingpu, and other counties, and an agreement has been reached to start supplying them steadily from the 15th of this month. However, it seems that the general public can no longer wait. Mr. Jiang added: In the two months he has been in Shanghai, he has deeply experienced the meaning of the two phrases "working hard and bearing resentment" and "cunning." He encouraged the team members to work hard, enrich their combat skills, reorganize their teams, strengthen their organization, go deep into the people, assist the government, solve the people's pain, and prevent the division of economic enemies. He said that he will soon establish a large-scale cadre training class in this city to make it the center of Shanghai's youth organization, with a warm heart and a calm mind, to move towards the front of the battle, "not competing for a moment, but competing for thousands of years."</p>

<h3>Increase in Deposit and Loan Interest Rates - Export Industry Hopes for Prompt Adjustment of Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance has accepted the request of the Shanghai money industry to increase the loan interest rate to 1.8% per month, which is almost five times the original rate. The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau immediately convened a meeting after receiving the order from the ministry and notified the money industry of this decision. The money supply has been very tight recently, and black market interest rates are as high as 40% or more. The previously stipulated interest rates are no longer realistic, so the Ministry of Finance decided to increase them after the banking industry applied.</p>
<p>Also, the adjustment of the exchange rate of the gold yuan currency after the lifting of price controls is inevitable, and the industrial and commercial sectors are paying close attention to this issue. The industrial sector hopes that the exchange rate will be determined with special care to avoid hindering domestic production. The export industry hopes for a prompt adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, otherwise the industry will be in a state of stagnation. The competent authorities are still studying this issue. To take into account both imports and exports, it may restore the system of foreign exchange settlement certificates.</p>
<p>Also, according to the Central Bank's Audit Department, the current deposits of the banks in this city in September totaled 214,791,900.29 gold yuan, and the term deposits were 25,994,022.52 gold yuan, for a total of 240,785,922.81 gold yuan. The paid-in reserve was 40,329,039.30 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice is Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>High-Grade White Japonica Rice in Nanshi is Selling for 90 Yuan</p>
<p>The total arrival of rice at the South Rice Market was 1,168 shi, with a continuous increase in supply, but the supply is still small. There are few spot goods, and transactions are very rare. The prices of high-grade white japonica rice and Bo Dao rice are all 90 yuan. The price of mid-grade early rice has risen from 73 yuan to 77 yuan. High-quality Du Jian rice is priced at 85 yuan. The market is stronger than the previous day. The arrival of goods at the North Rice Market decreased compared to the previous day, totaling only 237 shi. Transactions in the market have stalled due to a lack of goods.</p>
<h3>Not Much Sugar Trading - Prices Have Risen Two and a Half Times</h3>
<p>Sugar merchants went to the market one after another yesterday, and although there were many price discussions, actual transactions were very rare. The asking price for No. 24 raw sugar was around 105 yuan, and there were a few transactions, which was about two and a half times the controlled price. There has been no news of other goods.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Trading Resumes</h3>
<p>The edible oil market resumed trading yesterday. As directed by the Bureau of Social Affairs, the price of soybean oil was set at 190 yuan, and other oil prices could be traded with reference to the price of soybean oil. At 11:00 AM, trading began in the market, and merchants gathered, crowding the entire market. The oil factories jointly opened for sale first, with a uniform price of 190 yuan, and retailers all purchased. Subsequently, medium-sized barrels of cooked vegetable oil were priced at 170 yuan, and large barrels were priced at 175 yuan. The Da De New Factory opened the price of raw vegetable oil at 180 yuan, and Huimin at 175 yuan. No raw oil was heard to be opened. Small barrels of sesame oil were opened at 250 yuan. The trading situation was very heated.</p>
<p>Soybean cake trading also resumed yesterday. The spot price was first opened at 21 yuan, and then the factory also opened, with the highest price being 22.5 yuan. About 2,300 pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions are Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea market transactions still lacked reality, mainly because the stock was about to run out. At the same time, since the Executive Yuan approved the relaxation of price controls and implemented negotiated pricing, most goods have seen an increase in price. Therefore, those who hold goods in their hands are reluctant to let go easily, and the asking prices have risen in unison, making it difficult to achieve transactions. Looking at this situation, the future is extraordinarily brilliant.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Dispatches Goods to the Market</h3>
<p>Since the government lifted price controls, the Cigarette Industry Association feared market disruptions and excessive pricing. It convened an emergency meeting of its directors and supervisors yesterday, resolving to notify members to immediately dispatch goods to the market. Regarding pricing, calculations based on current raw material costs would necessitate at least a 200-300% increase. However, the association, upholding the public interest, earnestly advised members to minimize price increases as much as possible. It also notified the market that major companies, including Huacheng, Huaming, Zhonghua, Fuhua, Fuxin, Yuhua, Huamei, Nanyang, Yizhong, and Dadongnan, would be dispatching goods immediately.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market remained closed.

The approved prices were 170% higher than before. The prices of various yarns have also been approved and may be available for sale starting today. Regardless of the brand, 10-count yarn is priced at 1,223 yuan, 16-count at 1,600 yuan, 20-count at 1,800 yuan, 32-count at 2,400 yuan, 40-count at 2,735 yuan, 42-count double-ply at 3,305 yuan, Dragon Head cloth at 79.65 yuan, 20-count yarn fine cloth at 64.5 yuan, and "Four Gentlemen" Biji at 89.85 yuan.</p>

Market sentiment was stronger than before. According to industry insiders, current production prices at Yingkou are still rising steadily, reportedly reaching around 170-180 yuan per dan. Therefore, at these negotiated prices, only meager profits can be made.</p>

<h3>No Rice</h3>
<p>— Mengqiu</p>
<p>These days, I'm even more afraid of seeing Lao Hong.</p>
<p>But the less I want to see him, the more likely I am to bump into him. The fact is that we're all crammed into the same big courtyard, so it's really hard to avoid each other, especially since my room and his are directly opposite each other. He has lung disease, but there are plenty of people with lung disease in this dormitory, so that's not what I'm afraid of. What I'm most afraid of is that when he sees me, he always comes over with a smile and asks:</p>
<p>"Hey, brother, the rationed rice is coming soon, right? When can we get it?"</p>
<p>I always say: "Soon, the newspaper says it should be here soon."</p>
<p>Every time I answer like that, I feel a pang of discomfort in my heart. Doesn't he read the newspaper every day? In fact, every morning, he waits at the door, and as soon as the newspaper delivery boy's bicycle arrives, he grabs the paper to look for news about the rice ration. But he still has to ask me. It's almost tormenting me because I can't even make my own rice last for four or five days.</p>
<p>Lao Hong is a low-level clerk in an unimportant government office, with a monthly salary of 48 gold yuan. If you saw his haggard face, disheveled hair, and several days' worth of stubble, you might think he was a middle-aged opium addict. He's tall and his back is hunched. He always speaks so softly. Sometimes when I walk past his door, if it's open, I often see him lying on the bed, motionless. I can't even believe he's only a 26-year-old young man this year.</p>
<p>Last spring, when his wife, whom he had just married last year, came from the countryside to live with him, we were all very happy, saying that Lao Hong could have someone to take care of him—who would have thought that this young woman, who was still very healthy a few months ago, would become so gaunt and sickly after a miscarriage!</p>
<p>These days have been really tough on Lao Hong. Others are complaining about queuing, but in our area, none of the rice shops have any rationed rice at all. For the sake of eating, let's queue then, the queue is long as it is, as long as there is a queue, there is still hope of buying. But although there are quite a few rice shops in our area, only two of them have sold rationed rice for two half days, and even that "half day" only lasted for two hours. We haven't even seen a glimpse of the five liters of rice rationed per person. People in the queue are complaining, but we're envying them for still having a queue to join!</p>
<p>My family sometimes goes to restaurants to eat, anyway, just to fill our stomachs, without caring about what we're eating. But Lao Hong's wife strictly adheres to the principle of living within one's means, keeping a close watch on Lao Hong's budget...</p>
<p>They eat large pancakes, but the pancake stalls have also closed down. They eat sweet potatoes, but sweet potatoes are also not easy to buy, and the prices are very different from a few days ago.</p>
<p>A kind-hearted neighbor gave Lao Hong half a basin of brown rice. She later said: Lao Hong was still smiling, but tears were streaming down his face. That neighbor herself didn't have a lot of rice stored, and she couldn't help but cry when she got home.</p>
<p>The place where Lao Hong works isn't very strict, but taking too much time off will still result in punishment. Their section chief has also said to Lao Hong, intentionally or unintentionally, that their department is about to downsize.</p>
<p>Heaven knows, Lao Hong isn't alone! But I'm more and more afraid of him. I'm afraid to see his bitter smile, I'm afraid to see his forced "nothing's wrong" expression.</p>
<p>Therefore, I made a decision this morning. I usually leave home at 8:45, which is the easiest time to bump into him, so today I changed it to 8:00.</p>
<p>Actually, it was only 7:45 when I walked out the door, because I also wanted to try my luck at the nearby stalls to see if I could get a bowl of Yangchun noodles or something. However, just as I lowered my head to walk out the door, I heard a familiar voice:</p>
<p>"Hey, brother, you have better information than us, when is the rice ration coming?"</p>
<p>I was startled. I looked up, and of course it was him. But strangely enough, there seemed to be a hint of joy on his haggard face.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to prevaricate, he blurted out without waiting for me to answer:</p>
<p>"Look, it wasn't easy! I went to queue at four in the morning and got this..."</p>
<p>In his hand, he was holding about half a pound of gray-black raw noodles. I wanted to advise him to take better care of his health, but my throat seemed to be blocked. I smiled and urged him to go back quickly and eat a bowl of hot noodles before going to work. He also smiled, coughing violently. He waved goodbye, and I hurriedly walked away.</p>
<p>Half a pound of noodles for two people, four ounces each, is that the food for the whole day? Thinking of this, I had already reached the tram stop.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Chen Shuren</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>We met and became friends over wine by the Yangtze and Han Rivers, never realizing our connection was destined. You were called the master of poetry, and your spiritual likeness on stone was like that of Su Shi (I casually painted ink bamboo, and you added rocks). You were still on the moonlit bamboo forest path, but the tide dimmed in Lychee Bay. In autumn, feelings of grief for you and your zither are endless, and the crickets cry in the hall, bidding a faint farewell.</p>
<p>My thoughts are filled with sorrow for the overseas land, the news of your death was delayed by wind and rain (Mr. Chen passed away on October 4th of this year, and I only received the obituary from the Chen residence in Guangzhou on the 8th of the same month). You were a respected elder of the era, and your noble demeanor will be admired for centuries. Like you, one should be at peace with oneself! Who in the world would not support you? You left us with the purity of both plum blossoms and bamboo, and the New Year's poem and painting (Mr. Chen inscribed his "Purity of Plum Blossoms and Bamboo" painting with the line "New Year's poems and paintings to welcome the year").</p>
<h3>Remembering Hengtang</h3>
<p>— Xihou</p>
<p>Hengtang is a small town in Suzhou. It is not considered a famous scenic spot, as evidenced by the fact that tour groups do not include it in their sightseeing programs. But like Maple Bridge, it often shines in the poems of previous generations, and seems to have a connection with women, thus carrying a bit of a romantic air. Its origin, to speak more recently, is probably related to the Tang Dynasty poet Cui Hao's line in "Changgan Ballad": "My concubine lives in Hengtang."</p>
<p>Like many historical sites, I first experienced the atmosphere of Hengtang on paper, and then experienced it in person. It was on the evening of the same day when I passed Maple Bridge, as mentioned earlier, that I spent the night in Hengtang. Looking far across Rainbow Cloud Bridge, I saw the yellow bridge pavilion, the sound of the bells on the corners of the pavilion, scattered in the wind. The boatman pointed out that these bells were not the original ones. The original sound of the bells could be heard thirty miles away in Taihu Lake, but the Japanese had taken them away. I don't know if that's believable. But this time I only heard about searching for the ancient bell of Hanshan Temple, and not about returning the ancient bell of Hengtang. Although giving up the small to seek the big, it is still disappointing.</p>
<p>That time I went to Hengtang, I passed through the bridge, and there were Buddhist statues in the bridge pavilion, with flickering incense, so the pavilion was painted yellow, to resemble the walls of a temple. The streets on both sides were narrow, the sound of oars and voices of people, a desolate waterside town. It was just a brief night, and there was nothing to linger for. It was later, when I occasionally wrote about dormitory life, that I had the line "The sound of rain fills the room and I sleep in my clothes, just like mooring in Hengtang at night."</p>
<p>Hengtang is not far from Xumen, and can be reached on foot, but usually boats are taken. As you approach the town, several chimneys rise up in the distance, which are the lime kilns in the town starting to work. If there is a good wind, it will also bring sparse bell sounds. Then the yellow ferry pavilion comes into view. When the boat enters the middle bridge hole, raise your head and say "Hengtang Ancient Ferry", as if you have already read many poems and stories about Hengtang.</p>
<p>I remember in the spring sixteen years ago, I took a "clang-clang boat" (a boat that attracts customers by knocking on a small gong) with a friend to play at Mudu. Suddenly I had a feeling in the boat and left behind a "Dian Jiang Chun" poem: "Small oars, light boat, I ask if you live in Hengtang? The green eyebrows are silent, I am afraid that you will leave on the waves. By which bridge is the parting place. Flowers are ownerless, spring breeze road, a burst like red rain." Old friends who traveled with me have long since vanished with the "green eyebrows" and "red rain".</p>
<p>Except for sweeping tombs and hiking in the mountains, and stopping to rest along the way, it is rare to visit Hengtang specially. Who knew that once the war started, the front lines shifted inwards, and to avoid the enemy, I had to leave and travel elsewhere. Passing through Hengtang, ah! Hengtang had changed its face. The lime kilns were broken, the chimneys no longer released smoke, the ferry pavilion was still there, but the incense was extinguished. The river water had been turbid for a long time, and few boats were seen. Occasionally, there were shadows of people lurking among the sparse trees and dilapidated houses. The scene was desolate and heartbreaking. I had no choice but to quicken my pace and pass by in a glance. This year, when searching through my old boxes, I found a poem I had written at the time to express my feelings, "Zhe Gu Tian": "A piece of Hengtang ripples into words, I don't know if it's tears or rouge! Don't stop the boat to ask about the wind and waves, the concubine has no family and few traces. Endless hate, who knows it? At the ferry, sobbing for a long time: The setting sun and flowing water are not mine, all given to military songs and horse neighs."</p>
<p>In the past twelve years, I have not set foot in Maple Bridge or Hengtang again, let alone the sights of Tianping and Qionglong. Yesterday I went out of Xumen, stood for a while on the bridge, facing the bay of green water, and recited the line "Hengtang is lost in small boats, how is the scenery now"? I felt quite lost. I am especially concerned about the lost ancient bell of the ferry. When will it be able to return to its homeland with the ancient bell of Hanshan, I will definitely sail on the Five Lakes, and listen to the bell sound pouring out the accumulated sorrows among the vast smoke and waves.</p>
<h3>Ancestors and Descendants</h3>
<p>— Song Xian</p>
<p>Japanese author Katoh Hiroshi said: "All people once had parents, and the father also had parents, and the mother also had parents, that is, grandparents, a total of four people. Grandparents also had their own parents, a total of sixteen people, that is, great-grandparents. In this way, it increases geometrically to thirty-two people, sixty-four people, one hundred and twenty-eight people... If thirty years is taken as one generation, then ten generations in three hundred years have one thousand and twenty-four ancestors; twenty generations in six hundred years have one million forty-eight thousand five hundred and seventy-six ancestors; thirty generations in nine hundred years have one billion forty million one hundred seventy-four thousand one hundred eighty-four ancestors; thirty-three generations have three billion three hundred thirty-three million nine hundred thirty-four thousand five hundred ninety-two people. The number of ancestors increases gradually, so the number of ancestors in thousands of years can only be expressed by astronomical figures."</p>
<p>Madame Maite-McFane in France had a child in the first year of her marriage, twins in the second year, three children in the third year, four in the fourth year, five in the fifth, and six in the sixth year. She died unfortunately from dystocia in the seventh year.</p>
<p>When Thomas Bock of New York City, USA, died, he had 658 descendants.</p>
<p>Lukas Jofen of Jahrburg, Germany, was born in 1612 and died in 1679. He had five sons, eighty-seven grandchildren, four hundred and forty-six great-grandchildren, and five hundred and fifty-three great-great-grandchildren. His family thrived for five generations, which can be said to have created the world's highest record.</p>
<h3>Snippets of Japan</h3>
<p>— Sun Jichang</p>
<p>The first sight of Yokohama, what struck me was the forest of factory chimneys. Now it's like a forest in spring, sprouting and growing leaves, thriving.</p>
<p>When going ashore for a short visit, one must abide by the rules promulgated by the US military, such as: only one opened pack of cigarettes or two cigars are allowed; one pack of chewing gum or one bar of candy; no US dollars are allowed, and Japanese yen must be exchanged at the designated US military finance office, and an "exchange certificate" must be kept for verification, otherwise it will be considered illegally obtained, and if goods are purchased, it will be considered an illegal transaction, punishable by a fine for minor offenses and imprisonment for up to six months for serious offenses; most shops, hotels, theaters, hospitals, hostels and public places are Off Limit (restricted areas), and one cannot enter Japanese homes after eleven o'clock at night; landing is not allowed to exceed twenty-four hours, etc. But the US military has also learned the officialdom's way of doing things.</p>
<p>Japanese people's clothing is all old and worn, but a large number of Japanese woolens have been discovered in Hong Kong, passing off as something else to compete with British and American products in the market.</p>
<p>Several colleagues were strolling on the streets of Kawasaki when two or three Japanese children made gun gestures with their hands, aimed, and then said "Bang, bang" several times. My colleagues actually just smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Japanese yen was tricked out using cigarettes, but then they tricked the things back. In Tokyo and Yokohama, after spending a lot of time and running around a lot of shops, I couldn't find any American goods. All there was were a few old cameras.</p>
<p>The Yawata steel mill kept me running for several hours without finding the gate. I invited three "pilots" to eat a simple meal on the ship. They were very grateful, saying that they would never forget this delicious meal in three years.</p>
<p>Only when sitting in a carriage exclusively for UN military and civilians did I feel a slight taste of the privileges of a victorious country. (Sent from Yawata on October 20, 1948)</p>
<h3>Dog Penis and Diving Beetles</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>The "Records of the Grand Historian, Biography of Jing Ke" states that when Jing Ke traveled to Yan, he befriended Gao Jianli, a dog butcher in the Yan market. Fan Kuai, also a dog butcher, assisted Emperor Gao of Han in establishing his empire. This shows that from the Warring States period to the Han Dynasty, dog meat was a common food for the people. Later, it is unknown in what era, pork gradually became popular, and people ate beef and mutton, but no longer used dog meat as a side dish. However, people in Guangdong and Guangxi still preserve the ancient custom, regarding dog meat as a delicacy. They do not use knives to kill dogs. Several days before inviting guests, they hang the dog by its hind legs in the air, starving it to death, and then cook it. There is a saying that "yellow is first, black is second, and spotted is third," meaning that yellow dogs are the best quality. When I was over ten years old and living in Wuchang, I suffered from malaria. At that time, I did not know about the special effects of quinine. The alternating chills and fever lasted for two months before stopping. I was extremely weak. Someone said that dog meat could cure malaria, so my family bought dog meat to stew and eat. I ate it two or three times and only felt my body heat up after eating it. The meat was not difficult to eat, but I didn't think it was particularly delicious either.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic, when I was in the old capital, I heard a friend say that he was invited to a banquet by Lu Rongting. Lu's adjutant came beforehand to declare, "The general did not bring many dogs, and Zhang Dingwu (i.e., Zhang Junmai) took one a few days ago, please forgive us." My friend heard this and did not understand its meaning. When the banquet arrived, my friend was seated in the second position. After the cold dishes and stir-fries, the main dish was served, which was dog meat. A separate plate was placed in front of the first seat (Guo Zidian, then Secretary-General of the State Council), containing an object about one inch long, black in color, which was the dog's penis. Observing the host's solemn speech, one could know the value of this item. My friend then suddenly understood the adjutant's statement, because there were eight or nine guests at the table, and this special dish only had one, so he asked my friend to forgive him.</p>
<p>Diving beetles are small insects that can swim in water and fly out of water. They live in the wetlands of rural villages and, like osmanthus cicadas, are a nourishing snack for the people of Guangdong after autumn. The first time I tasted this food was at the residence of the famous courtesan Xiao Hong Lao Si. Xiao Hong claimed to be the daughter of Cai Naihuang, and was known as Miss Cai Si. Around 1921 in the Jufu Troupe in Shaanxi Alley in the old capital, she occupied nine rooms alone and was the most popular prostitute at the time. Friends nicknamed her, and I often went to her place. One day, Chen Feigong had a big fight with her, and I helped to mediate, so Xiao Hong was grateful to me. In 1924, I resigned from my position at the Ministry of Education's Compilation and Review Office and returned south, living on the lake. One day in the spring of 1925, I was drinking old wine with two or three friends at Chen Zhenghe's roadside stall in Qixia Camp. Suddenly, a chartered car came from the north at dusk, with four water-moon electric lights shining brightly on people. I went to the sidewalk to watch. A woman sitting in the car looked familiar. Just as I was dazed, there was a "ding-dong" sound, and the car stopped briefly. The woman said, "Are you Mr. Chen Si? Please come to the West Lake Hotel to play." She still spoke with a very good Beijing accent. After speaking, she waved her right hand, and the chartered car sped away. I then remembered that it was Xiao Hong Lao Si. I visited her late at night. Xiao Hong brought out brandy to drink together. There was another plate of snacks, which were black insects. I dared not eat them. Xiao Hong said that these were Guangdong diving beetles, which were most fragrant when stir-fried. I took one to taste, and it did indeed have a unique flavor, so I devoured it. Dog penis and diving beetles are both delicacies favored by the people of Guangdong. The two items are both black when prepared, so I recorded them together. (Xiao Hong was the "President of the Flower Kingdom" in Shanghai at the time, and her boudoir was located west of the Great World. People over fifty years old who have been to brothels must know about her.)</p>
