<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕預算局官員八日指出：下屆會計年度之預算總額，尙有待於美國軍事援助中國及西歐數額之決定。在明年一月初，杜魯門總統將提出自一九四九年七月一日開始之會計年度之費用請求，在上年度中，總統要求之數額爲四二·一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。一般揣測，本年度之預算，將較之超出數十億元。顯然，此兩項外交政策，在以後數週內，至少必須作暫時性之決定，對於中國提出之十億美元緊急援助之新要求，必將有所決定。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎七日電〕安全理事會現無力制止共黨在華猖狂，安理會十一會負國犬部份嘆惜共黨竟能得利，但無一會員國存有安理會能採取有效行動之希望。安理會爲技術特性所束縛，但卽使無此技術上特性，安理會亦似太嫌孱弱，不足阻遏正在前進之共軍。安理會所以不能有所作爲者，計有下列三大原因。</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯對於反對中共之任何可能行動，將加以否決。</p>
<p>（二）安理會不得干涉一國內政，故在聲言有權受理中國事件以前，安理會須證明此係國際性糾紛，諸如蘇聯等若干國家的確參預反對中國政府之戰爭。</p>

<p>安理會如果受理中國事件，充其量亦不過集中對該問題之注意。此項辦法前已於其他各問題用過，最顯明者爲希臘問題，在希臘事件中，安理會內大多數會員國通過阿爾巴尼亞。保加利亞及南斯拉夫三國在援助希臘共黨，因此威脅希腦政府，但蘇聯不斷運用否決權以阻撓安理會行動。</p>

<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕日來外間盛傳美國海軍陸戰隊將來滬維持治安，美國駐滬總領事葛柏德八日發表聲明，加以否認。美商電力公司當局亦否認曾向美國請求派兵保護之說。據現在所知，此間美方當局業已準備於局勢混亂之時，派兵保護撤退僑民，並無調兵來滬保護美國官方或私人財產之意。美國如派兵來滬代爲維持治安，則須國務院決定，此間尙無一人知有此種決定，或期待此種決定。美商數百家在滬資產可觀，固願見美兵開到保護，卽全滬居民亦所歡迎，惟美政府當局迄未表示有意捲入中國內戰漩渦。據美國駐滬海軍軍官克勞福向記者稱，美國續派海軍陸戰隊至靑島海軍基地事，當初亦係華盛頓方面首先宣布。</p>

<h3 id="c27">保護交通安全 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>近因大局動盪，人心惶惶，海陸空運疏散工作，呈現空前擁擠狀態，以致輪船飛機及火車汽車，連續發生慘案，生命財產同罹巨難。這是人間的悲劇，社會的不幸！交通治安機關如不從速管制疏散，保護交通安全，藉以穩定人心，則交通混亂，後患堪虞。</p>
<p>這次交通的混亂是空前的，尤其京滬杭火車的擁擠，駛往香港台灣船隻的載重逾量，巳經失去交通活動的正軌。招商局的「江亞輪」是一隻行駛滬甬綫的大輪，三日夜載旅客約三千人赴甬，不料行駛銅沙洋面即發生爆炸。據招商局說：該輪全部乘客爲二五六五人，職工爲一二二人，計失蹤的乘客一千六百餘人，職工六十八人，大多罹難，死在船裏，或沉在海底。另據寗波同鄉會辦理登記死難旅客姓名，迄今已達二千名，道當然是一件空前的慘案。在同一日內，由京飛台的飛機一架，也在台北機塲肇事了，計死難乘客廿五人。混亂情形繼續發生，五日晨京滬綫無錫站附近又有撞車慘劇，死三十餘人；同時錫澄長途汽車赴江陰途中又失事，死七人，傷廿八人。同日下午五時三刻中航機第五三八號C－46型飛機由渝飛滬，因龍華機塲霧大，又無雷達設備，乃改在江灣機塲降落，不幸降落時機身被撞在跑道旁的土堆上，機師及乘客死十人，受傷十一人。此外，尙有多起交通肇事，如火車下跌死的，或車船被擁遭難的，事雖出於不幸，但決非偶然的現象。</p>
<p>連續不斷的交通肇事，直接的原因，當是疏散交通的漫無計畫，管理秩序極爲紊亂，及旅客心理上的不健康；間接的原因，是交通設備有問題，未能盡愜人意。「江亞輪」的爆炸若非由於鍋爐有問題，或係爲某種爆炸物的作祟，果爾，則無論其來自船內或船外，均有澈底查明及將來防息未然的必要。吳淞口外以及沿江沿海的航道，海軍當有嚴密巡邊的責任。京滬杭的火車和各綫汽車，其擁擠肇事的原因，多由於售票的膨脹，及疏散的無計劃。旅客心理的不健康，泰半由於認識不够，生活的觀念有錯誤。戰塲在千百里以外，便發生這種東奔西逃的現象，無異自尋苦悶。如果這種心理不轉變，是無助於交通安全的。要之，交通的安全即旅客的安全；不僅交通治安機關同有責任，即放客自身也有責任。因此。交通安全的第一要訣，便是社會秩序回復平常，人心回復鎭定。</p>
<p>江灣機塲和台北機塲的飛機肇事，是機塲缺少雷達的設備，這是何等不幸的事。前年底和去年春天，中央中航飛機多架，曾在上海靑島失事，後來乃有「民航局」的設立，凖備在各機塲設置雷達，並備各項救生安全技術，以减少萬一之危險。這次上海台北同日有兩機肇事，固由於大霧迷漫，而民航設備的仍未健全，也是不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>說到迭次交通聚事的責任問題，從行政管理和社會道德的角度上看，海陸空交通機關應負直接間接的責任，希望一方面進行追查，一方面迅速賠償撫恤死難的旅客。至於今後的交通疏散，當是一件極重要的事，希望交通治安各機關，進行有計劃的疏散，並時作事前的檢查，意外的準備，而使售票尤須有適當的限度，以策萬全。總之，國家現狀正値艱困的階段，爲了應付非常局面，管制交通疏散，保護交通安全，巳爲刻不容緩的事了。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕近日外傳政府提高黃金兌價之說，絕無其事。據財部發言人稱：黃金兌換已依照「修正金圓券發行辦法」第十一條之規定：「凡以金圓券存入中央銀行指定之銀行，定期滿一年者，除照章計息外，並得於存款時，以與存款同額之金圓券，向存款銀行兌換金圓，在金圓未籌成前，得按規定比率，兌取黃金或銀幣」。目前各大都市均照此辦理，此項兌換價格及存款數額，政府絕未老慮燮更，外傳提高黃金兌價之說，純係奸人造謠，冀岡牟利，不足置信。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕聯合國政委會今日辯論朝鮮問題，中國代表蔣廷廠發言稱，「將朝鮮分裂爲二，使三分之一人民屬於北韓，與三分之二人民屬於南韓，在朝鮮歷史上尙爲第一次。南北韓之間鐵幕障隔，雙方人民不能互相往來，實亦爲整個人類歷史上最大之悲劇。」中國代表承認五月十日南韓之選舉爲「民主選舉」，而選舉中所產生之議會爲「一代議之民主機構。」渠稱，「李承晚總統之政府確爲一代議政府。然此一業已開始之工作，目前尙未能完全完成，故聯大會應指派新委員會繼續努力。」</p>

<p>該會表示，爲澈底解決此一疑竇，今日決邀各有關當局及各界代表，乘船赴出事地點，自雇潛水夫入水探索，以視爆炸所在之實際情形，將來公諸社會，俾決定責任問題。昨招待會席上，各代表發言否定前日專家勘察結果時，旁聽之被難乘客家屬均情緒激昂，僉以招商局在江亞輪失事前後措施失當，對善後事宜又一再延宕，故呼籲各界主持正義，督策該局迅速進行，藉以此空前慘痛敎訓作爲航業界之殷鑒，而加强今後我國航海安全云。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　和香林</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江五日訊〕戡亂軍事，已到了緊要關頭，戰火已在江蘇的前哨徐蚌展開了保衛戰，由於此次會戰的大捷，更奠定了全面戡亂必勝的把握，無疑的，今日全國的人們，都在躭躭的關心着江蘇，以至牽想到中國整個局勢的前途，記者爲了把握這個重心，特把江蘇目前最重要的兩件大事報道如下：</p>
<p>先說糧政</p>
<p>不能算差，雖然匪氛未靖，環境特殊，而中央所配的糧額，每年都還可以徵足十分之八九，在全國糧政的考績上，算是一個比較說得過去的地區，據省田糧處洪副處長說：「這個一方面由於當局的努力，一方面是人民踴躍繳納，拖欠疲玩的業戶雖有終是佔極少數的」。又據記者調查：今年的徵起數字，到現在止，沒有半年多，一來是今年開徵的時期比較遲，二來因爲各縣的政費拮据，有的縣份不得不將徵起的稻穀，先行撥出一部份作爲政費的開又，可是今年的軍事，却比去年同時期緊張得多，前方需要軍糧，不是火急兩字所能形容的，中央的命令不得拖延必須如限徵足，如果辦理不力，卽以軍法從事，所以省田糧處派員分赴各縣市督徵不够，特又請丁主席派了各廳處長府委，卽日分區出發督催，以期如數徵足。</p>
<p>征糧區域</p>
<p>江蘇因軍事關係，除劃分爲綏靖區外，綏靖區及視同綏靖區三種，所有奉令劃列綏靖區之二十二縣市，爲適應事勢需要，已由省田糧處擬訂江蘇省綏靖區各縣市卅七年度田賦征收暫行辦法，分飭遵照，俾治安未靖各縣，對於中央規定章則，無法執行之際，有所依據，其次蘇北的海門，靖江，南通，等八縣市，雖未奉中央劃列爲綏靖區域，然各縣市治安情形與列入綏靖區相同，省府曾一再羅列實情，請求中央列入綏靖，雖未獲准，但爲顧及事實，也經省府委員會決議視同綏靖區縣份辦理。其餘江南之蘇州，江寗，溧水，常熟，高淳，金山，金壇，揚中，溧陽，崑山，靑浦，松江，鎭江，江浦，江陰，宜興，無錫，吳江，武進，丹陽，句容，儀徵，江都，六合等廿四縣，本年田賦均照中央規定法令繼續征實，寳山，嘉定，奉賢，南匯，上海，崇明，太倉，川沙等八縣，仍照上年成案折幣征收。</p>
<p>本省田賦征收種類，</p>
<p>征實種類</p>
<p>計分稻穀，小麥，苞穀三種：（一）征稻穀縣份：（一）非綏靖區蘇州，江寗等廿四縣。（二）綏靖區泰興，淮安等七縣。（三）視同綏靖區—連翼市。（二）征麥縣市—銅山，東海等四縣。（三）征苞穀縣份：綏靖區爲灌雲，視同綏靖區爲海門。（四）征幣縣份：非綏靖區爲寳山，嘉定，奉賢，南匯，上海，崇明，太倉，川沙等八縣中。綏靖區爲東台，如皋，啓束，視同綏靖區爲南通。</p>
<p>征率核定</p>
<p>如下：（一）征稻穀縣份每賦一元，征實一斗二升，征借九升，公糧四升八合，合計實征二斗五升八合，（綏靖區暫免征借）（二）征小麥縣份：按稻穀七折計算，每賦一元，征實八升四合，征借六升三合，公糧三升四合，合計征實一斗八升一合，公糧四升三合二勺，合計實征三斗三升二合二勺，（四）積穀按征實之一成帶征（綏靖區暫緩帶征）</p>
<p>本年度田賦征收，自十一月開始迄今，已征起總額之一成，爲實物二六七·三〇七石，現在中火因需要軍糧萬急，並限在兩月內完成足額。糧食部駐省督導竇大有，已赴大江南北各縣催征，務必如限征足。</p>
<p>江蘇役政</p>
<p>目前可以說能够走上軌道了，過去每期的征兵，總脫離不掉「兵販子」東拉西扯的操縱，以至造成了濫竿充數的現象，國防郃對此極端注意，曾屢令各軍師團管區嚴密防範，日前蔣總統以戡亂軍事已至緊要關頭，特發動人力動員之緊急號召，電令各省市征兵機構，預征卅八年度新兵之一部份，江蘇共需征一萬二千名，此間蘇南師管區已奉令應征足四千八百名，自本月一日起，全面開始征集入營，十五日前一次完成。同時，這一次征兵，爲避免逃兵混充志願兵，消耗地方財力，決定辦理抽籖，並規定：</p>
<p>六項辦法</p>
<p>（一）多征快征，只許提前，不准落後。（二）切實防範奸諜。（三）絕對不准頂名遞換。（四）拿獲逃兵決予槍決。（五）責成各縣市兵役協會檢舉征集舞弊，並辦理獎懲。（六）切實辦理征屬優待。</p>
<p>這兩件大事，當局正以全副力量積極的展開，記者默祝這一次一定能够如限如期的圓滿成功，發生示範作用。最後，附帶報導，現階段的江蘇，已進入了戰時體制，中央最近並發表蘇主席丁治磐兼任江蘇省黨部主委，預料今後的江蘇黨政軍密切的配合運用，殆無疑義。</p>

<p>〔本報無錫六日訊〕江陰南沙鄕人陳桂南，向業柴版，五日陳又販得樹柴一船，由澄裝運來錫，停泊周山浜北新橋河下，詎在五日晨五時許，突有一絲不掛全身精赤之中年男子上船要衣要食，陳堅不應允，彼卽　在船艙中，迨至下午五時，準備煮晚飯，卽上街購米，船夥羅德才亦上岸取物，船上做留陳之十歲幼子隆興一名。該男子見船上無人，竟取得竹刀一柄，向隆興猛劈，計頭上六刀，手上二刀，劈得腦漿迸裂，血肉四溢，頓時氣絕身死。德才首先回船，見狀不禁大駭，連呼救命。岸上行人聞訊，擁上柴船，將該行兇男子看管，一面馳赴該管仁愛鎭自衛團派負前往拘捕。該男子見已肇禍，於上岸時一躍入河，意圖自盡，復經人撈起，帶隊詰詢。據供：名廖裕喜，年三十七歲，廣東大埔人，前在靑年軍二〇二師司令部當上等兵，方於昨夜來錫，在黑暗中跌落糞厠中，故未穿衣服，因船主不給衣食，乃將小孩劈死以洩憤，現自願償命等語。鎭長朱祖武據供，以案關尺命，決呈解城防指揮部訊辦</p>
<h3 id="c134">香港是安樂窩嗎？　海陸寬警舉行聨合大演習 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者</p>
<p>〔本報香港七日航訊〕香港在太平洋戰事前夕，頻頻舉行「軍事演習」，曾幾何時，在七年後的今天，又第一度與居民「重見」了·當局雖然鄭重的表示「將盡可能避免使居民感受不便」，但居民一覺醒來，看見各報以最大的標題刊出：「軍隊充暴徒向警察進攻」的大演習消息，倒不免有點惶惶之感吧。</p>
<p>這個海陸空軍和警察的聯合大演習，從六日起，先後在香港，九龍和新界舉行，爲期約一週之久。六日上午開始，全港便宣佈准入</p>
<p>緊急狀態</p>
<p>香港本島之戰，預料在兩天內完成，「反動份子」將襲擊政府建築物，無綫電台，電力站，並企圖佔領公用事業，警察署等重要中心。繼香港之戰後，九龍半島也舉行一個類似的演習。而新界之戰，規模尤大。海陸軍將試行登陸，空軍則以以降洛傘向守軍投擲糧食給養。香港的防衛者將與滲入英界和英領海內的反動份子作「假想戰」，並毀滅「匪徒」的匿藏地點。</p>
<p>據星島日報稱：「本港防務問題，東南亞英陸軍總帥當局極爲重視。最近東南亞英專員召集會議，討論問題，亦以香港爲主題。最近英陸軍東南亞總司令烈治將軍來港，與本港</p>
<p>陸軍總司令</p>
<p>馬調斯少將會商此次演習，並策劃一切，藉以實騐本港防衛力量。此次防範匪徒暴亂演習，乃爲會商之結果，亦爲東南亞英專員所召集之會議，討論有關香港問題主要者之一」。可見港當局此次舉行軍事大演習，是經過相當考慮與籌備的結果。該報又稱：</p>
<p>「邇來因中國境內共產黨勢力之繼續膨脹，以及前此廣九路沿綫刧車案件引起之謠言，中港邊境治安突受嚴重咸脅。香港當局對太港守軍之配備，遂亦不能不予以增强，以應付萬一發生之意外。記者昨據有關方面探悉：月來自新加坡及英國運載來港之軍火器械等，先後已有多批，其中包括高射砲，防毒面罩，彈藥及軍用品等，起卸後卽行入倉，準備日間分發各部隊應用。」</p>
<p>國內若干人士正把香港</p>
<p>當作「桃源」</p>
<p>而不遠千里地奔來的時候，香港却宣佈舉行這個充滿火藥味的演習，那是多麼矛盾的一回事。在這個消息公佈的同時，美聯社駐港記者發表一篇長文，根據他「訪問政府官員，經濟學家，國民黨員，共產黨員多人意見的結果，一致認爲今後「不致立刻威脅到英國屬地的香港。」美聯社記者又引述某當局稱：「我們從上次大戰中知道：我們在大陸上</p>
<p>有限的防禦，實無法從軍事上保衛香港。」美聯社這篇稿子，給港報加上「香港仍是安獎窩」的標題，與大演習的宣佈在同一篇輻上「平分秋色」。到底港當局的估計錯誤呢？還是美聯社記者估計錯誤呢？未便遽下斷語。但無論如何，香港這個「非常」的步驟，是獲得大多數居民擁護的。</p>

<p>— 本報記者</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州六日航訊〕西北是我國天然的畜牧區，外人稱爲世界三大牧塲之一，而與美國西部及澳洲並駕齊驅。在這將近一百七十餘萬方里的牧原上，豢養着無數的家畜，尤以羊隻爲最多。在靑海·新疆·以及安多藏區地帶，羊隻的繁多已不遑計數，而以羣爲單位。據調查：新疆有綿羊九·八二八·三七八隻，山羊二·四三七·六九九隻，共計一二·二六六。〇七七隻。（西北地質調查所統計）甘肅有綿羊三·七五八·八三四隻，山羊一·二一九·〇一九隻，共計四·九七七·八五三隻。（張心一：甘肅省農業槪况估計）綏遠·寗夏等省，雖無最近的羊隻統計數字，據舊有資料，僅綏遠伊克召盟七旗之估計，就有羊一，三三〇·〇〇〇隻，兩省每年可量羊毛五七·二〇〇担，也可想見其擁有羊羣之多。不過，中國羊隻的</p>
<p>總</p>
<p>究竟有多少？到現在還沒有確實的統計，歷年來政府機關或團體，私人的調查報吿，言人人殊，難予置信，據約略的估計，約有四千五百萬隻，其中有四分之三在西北各省，其餘四分之一分佈於內地，若照「羊毛出在羊身上」的俗話，翻開中國羊毛的專籍來，可以得到下列的統計數字：</p>
<p>產地　產量　百分比</p>
<p>外蒙古　一四四、〇〇〇担　二二·九</p>
<p>寗夏·綏遠　四七、二〇〇担　九·一</p>
<p>察哈爾·熟河　四五、七五〇担　七·五</p>
<p>靑海　七一、五〇〇担　一一·</p>
<p>甘肅·新疆　一六〇、二六〇担　二五、四</p>
<p>其他各省　一五一、二九〇担　二四·〇</p>
<p>總計　六三〇、〇〇〇担　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>由此可知，西北羊隻的飼養，是如何發達了。</p>
<p>西北由於地勢，氣候及面積廣大，草原衆多諸原因，在那大山瀚海之間，高原平野之上，綠草豐林之中，到處都是天然的絕好</p>
<p>牧塲。就以甘肅祁連山而論，這種水草豐美的牧地，卽綿延連三千華里，在無垠的靑靑草原上，夾雜着猩猩點點的野花，蠕動着白的，黑的，或黃的，那是牛羣，馬羣和羊羣，在小河的近傍，還可以望見靑烟裊裊地隨風上昇，那是牧者的帳蓬。偶而從遠處飄過一陣高亢豪爽的山歌，那是牧羊女在發抒她靑春的情緒了。</p>
<p>我們總以爲游牧民族都是逐水草而居的，但目前這種情形已不很普遍了。在道從事牧畜的人多的地方，每家的牧地都有一定的區域，各不侵犯。在夏天，因爲牧草繁盛，這種界綫可以自由一點，待夏天剪過羊毛後，爲了保護自己的牧草留待冬天用，各家便帶領着羊羣，到山上公共的牧地過一個時期，等秋風吹黃塞上草的時候，他們又回到自己的牧塲上去，度過一個漫長的冬天。在這時，每家都認眞的保護自家的牧地，不讓他人侵犯，假如有人越界牧畜了，他們將不怕流血的保衛這生命的源泉。</p>

<h3 id="c141">奇蹟　石頭代煤　頁巖在迪化　取之不盡·用之不竭 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>〔本報迪化五日舫訊〕天山飛雪，冷風剌骨，乏煤的季節，天氣也似乎格外的冷，電燈時明時滅，浴室寒氣襲人，日報傍晚出版，工廠不斷停擺，各學校爲了冷不可耐，已準備提早放寒假。省府雖然勉爲解瘊了煤的問題，但數量上自然不足，學校乃疏散住校學生，想把宿舍裏用的煤省下來，多支持幾天敎室的用煤，用心可謂良苦。</p>
<p>今冬嚴重煤荒的造成，據政府方面表示：只是運輸不便而已，迪市的煤產，不但足供本埠，尙可供給昌吉，乾德等縣，發生恐慌的原因，主要是運輸上的問題：八道灣煤礦離市區雖只幾十公里，但大車因草料高昂，不肯去拉，汽車因道路崎嶇，也不敢去拉，結果造成市面上供求的不平衡，煤價一漲，百物俱受刺激，人心浮動，無限凄凉！</p>
<p>眞是「花陰覆地疑無路，石徑穿雲別有天」，老滿城馱馬第九大隊的一個弟兄，在妖魔山下燒柴，忽然發現石頭燒着了，這「奇績」很快的傳播到附近居民的耳朶裏去，妖魔山下的居民，多是一些貧民，他們旣無錢去買煤，聽說有這種不花錢的石頭可以代煤，何不去痛快的挖掘一些，回來取暖，於是有的提着小筐，有的帶着兜巾，也有趕着大車，浩浩蕩蕩的，搶着掘不花錢的煤石頭。</p>
<p>這石頭便是汕頁岩，被挖掘的是妖魔山附近有防空洞的一帶。油頁岩是一層屑鋒薄的黑色石片，像飽含着油液，極容易引燃，燒起來也耐久而火力大，不過燒起時，有點異味，燒完了仍是不變形的石頭罷了。</p>
<p>地質調查所聽到這「奇蹟」之後，第二天淸早派七八個技術人員，去開採了幾十公斤汕頁岩，來作燦燒試騐，獲得的結論是：油頁岩不但熱力較煤强，且火焰持久，可達一小時左右，每次續添，只少量卽可。不過燒時應特別謹愼，燒起的臭味對呼吸是不大適宜的。</p>
<p>油頁岩是提　煤油和柴油的重工業原料，地質學家都曉得拿來用蒸溜法提煉油類。今年夏天，地質調查所在迪化近郊發現了大量的油頁岩，經過化驗後，油質並不好，以後沒有再去理會它。現在被人民無意中發現了它的新用途，使它有翻身的日子，倒是一件頗有意義的事。</p>
<p>近幾日來，無論晴，陰，風，雪，前往採運油頁岩的，絡繹不絕，連過去奔波於八道灣路上運煤的小毛驢，也轉移了目標，來採運油頁岩了。據地質調查所宣佈：迪化市附近的山巒，完全是這種油頁岩石所構成，取之不盡，用之不竭。這煤荒聲中的喜訊，不但减除了寒冷的成脅，還爲科學上發現一個新的證例—油頁岩可以代煤。</p>
<p>嚴冬已經來臨，省社會處的冬令救濟，也隨着展開，今年的救濟對象是赤貧五百人，經費省幣一千二百億元，已自本月一日開始了。（本報記者籍木）</p>

<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office, 8th] Liu Zhi went to Huaiyuan on the 8th for inspection and returned to Bengbu that evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] Jiang Weiguo, Chief of Staff of the Armored Forces Command, flew from Nanjing to Bengbu at 3:00 PM on the 8th and then went to a certain area in the front to command a powerful armored force in combat.</p>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office, 8th] The battle of Suxian and Bengbu continues under the crushing momentum of the National Army. The Huang Wei Corps uses strongholds such as Shuangduiji, Daying, and Luoji as bases to continue its bloody battle that has lasted for more than ten days, inflicting heavy blows on the invading bandits. According to news from the front, a part of this unit has joined forces with the northward corps. When the reporter inquired about this with the military, they replied that this was possible but could not be confirmed. The southward army is still fiercely fighting against the Chen bandits on the north bank of the Hui River. The continuing offensive of the northward corps has broken the resistance of the remaining troops of the 6th Column of the bandits. The right wing has reached Huoshenmiao, and the left wing has reached Wanggangzi (five li north of Zhangbaying). In recent days, the winter weather has been sunny and clear, and all three battlefields, with the powerful assistance of the Air Force, have continued to inflict heavy damage on the stubborn bandits.</p>
<p>[Report from our Suxian Office, 8th] Military News: Our strong northern advance troops are currently attacking and advancing towards Guzhen. A part of the bandits in the Hongze Lake area is attempting to cross the Huai River stealthily near Xuyi. The National Army is blocking and attacking them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] With the National Army launching a pincer attack from the north and south in the Bengbu-Suxian battle situation, the progress of the National Army is becoming increasingly rapid. The Huang Wei Corps is extending forward from a certain place southeast of Shuangduiji, coordinating with the northward Li Yannian Corps, and approaching Guzhen. Also, on the Heji-Huoshenmiao line, more than half of the 6th Column of the Chen bandits has been annihilated by our Li Corps, and its strength is failing. It has urgently transferred a part of the 2nd Column of the Liu bandits to participate in the battle in order to reverse the decline. We are gradually encircling and annihilating them. Furthermore, the southward corps from Xuzhou annihilated over 10,000 bandits near Mengji, capturing countless spoils.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] The bandits on the south bank of the Hui River on the Jinpu Railway front were completely defeated by our Li Corps yesterday, and they are advancing in an arc shape to the northwest, recovering key points such as Xinmaqiao, Zhangdianzi, and Zhangbaying. In total, 400 bandits were captured, more than 100 light machine guns were seized, and 1,000 bandits were killed. In addition, the Huang Wei Corps, fighting fiercely near Shuangduiji, is still fighting the main force of the Liu bandits and continues to gain temporary victories by defeating smaller groups with larger forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] Today, our Air Force fleet extensively bombed and strafed the communist forces hiding in fortifications in the northwestern area of Suixikou, estimating that the communist forces suffered more than 1,500 casualties. Our large corps continues to make progress east of Yongcheng. The communist area there was heavily bombarded by our army with heavy artillery, causing severe casualties. The communist retreat route has been cut off by us, and they are currently putting up a desperate resistance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 8th] Over 5,000 communist troops from the communist area near Xuyi on the bank of Hongze Lake were fiercely bombed and strafed by our Air Force yesterday in the area of Heqiaokou, and over 100 communist wooden boats were sunk. The communist forces fled in panic into the reeds to hide. Our air fleet dropped a large number of incendiary bombs, setting the reeds on fire and burning to death approximately 2,000 bandits. The remaining bandits scattered and fled. Our Air Force expanded the battle results with low-flying strafing before returning safely to base.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Bengbu Shortens Curfew Hours; Military Trains on Jinpu Railway Reach Caolaoji <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 8th] The war in North China is imminent, with a touch-and-go situation. The National Army has completed new deployments.

Fierce fighting took place in the north and south areas of Niulanshan from yesterday to this morning. The communist forces suffered heavy casualties and are currently blocked in the area south of Niulanshan, unable to advance.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 8th] There is no major change in the Pinggu Line war. Although communist forces have infiltrated the area between Huairou and Shunyi, their forces are small, and the focus of the war remains in the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway. Yang Jiafu, the magistrate of Shunyi County, has led his team safely to the designated location on the 8th. On the Pinghan Line, the magistrate of Zhuoxian County came to Beiping on the 7th, reported to the provincial government, and returned to the front on the same day.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 8th] A group of communist forces attacked Yongle Station north of Zhuoxian on the Pingbao Line and engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Budget Bureau officials pointed out on the 8th that the total budget for the next fiscal year still awaits a decision on the amount of U.S. military aid to China and Western Europe. President Truman will submit a request for expenditures for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1949, in early January next year. In the previous year, the amount requested by the President was $42.1 billion. It is generally speculated that this year's budget will exceed that by several billion dollars. Obviously, at least temporary decisions must be made on these two foreign policies in the coming weeks, and a decision will inevitably be made on the new request for one billion dollars in emergency aid from China.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 7th] The White House announced that President and Mrs. Truman will host Madame Chiang Kai-shek at Blair House on Friday, with Mrs. Marshall as another guest. Madame Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the United States is to seek additional economic and military aid for the Chinese government to combat communism in China.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Ross announced that the tea party would be held at 5:00 PM on Friday. When reporters asked if President Truman and Madame Chiang Kai-shek had any other meetings planned, Ross replied, "Everything I know has already been announced."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman's tea party at 5:00 PM on the 10th symbolizes that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will be treated purely as a high-ranking dignitary and the wife of the Chinese head of state. However, there is currently no way to prevent Madame Chiang Kai-shek from raising issues related to her trip during her "social visit," including inquiring about the reasons for the U.S. government's coldness towards expanding aid to China. Observers, after reading Madame Chiang Kai-shek's statement on the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor incident, discerned between the lines that Madame Chiang Kai-shek called on the United States to learn from past mistakes and reconsider and change its policy towards China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] It is learned that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will visit the "Hawthorn Blossom" Inn here tomorrow to attend the annual Christmas charity sale held by the United China Relief Association for China. The charity sale will be presided over by the wife of Ambassador Gu, and Mrs. Truman and Ambassador Gu Weijun will all participate in this grand event.</p>

<p>[Reported by Our News Agency] New York Broadcasting: Former Republican presidential candidate Landon recently harshly criticized the Truman administration's China policy, stating that it has made a big mistake and allowed the Soviet Union to gain a base in Asia. Landon asked Marshall to quickly recall General MacArthur to the country so that he can report to the President on the recent situation in China. Landon said that MacArthur is one of the most knowledgeable people in the United States about the Far East situation. If Marshall is unwilling to recall MacArthur, then the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee should summon MacArthur to return to the United States and report to Congress.</p>

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 7th] The San Francisco Port Authority is considering a proposal to request the government to provide comprehensive aid to China. The original proposal stated that once the Communist Party controls Asia, it will forever threaten the peace of the United States, especially San Francisco and the Pacific coast. The U.S. Congress, President Truman, and the State Department should provide China with the necessary moral, financial, and material assistance to enable it to repel the communist aggression.</p>
<p>[United Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 8th] Congressman Zhou Yide declared on the evening of the 7th that unless the United States immediately provides comprehensive aid to China, just as it aids Greece and Turkey, the democratic future of China will be bleak.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 7th] Senator Marrow, chairman of the National Resources and Economics Committee of the U.S. Senate, said that the United States should immediately decide on its China policy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] According to the State Department's weekly report on military aid to China, as of December 3, the amount paid has been $117,038,559.74.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The Security Council Can Only Sigh Powerlessly in the Face of Communist Actions in China; The Soviet Union's Use of the Veto Is a Major Obstacle <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] The Security Council is currently powerless to stop the rampant Communist Party in China. The Security Council's members will express regret that the Communist Party is able to benefit, but none of the member states has any hope that the Security Council can take effective action. The Security Council is technically constrained, but even without this technical characteristic, the Security Council seems too weak to stop the advancing Communist army. There are three main reasons why the Security Council cannot do anything.</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union will veto any possible action against the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>(2) The Security Council shall not interfere in the internal affairs of a country, so before declaring that it has the right to handle the Chinese incident, the Security Council must prove that this is an international dispute, such as the participation of certain countries, such as the Soviet Union, in the war against the Chinese government.</p>
<p>(3) Even if these technical characteristics can be overcome, the Security Council has no tools to implement any orders.</p>
<p>If the Security Council handles the Chinese incident, it will at most focus attention on the issue. This method has been used on other issues before, most notably the Greek issue. In the Greek incident, the majority of member states of the Security Council accused Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia of assisting the Greek Communist Party, thereby threatening the Greek government, but the Soviet Union constantly used its veto power to obstruct the Security Council's actions.</p>

<p>[United Press, Local News] There have been rumors lately that the U.S. Marine Corps will come to Shanghai to maintain order. U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Cabot issued a statement on the 8th denying this. The authorities of the American-owned electricity company also denied having requested the United States to send troops to protect it. As far as is known now, the American authorities here have prepared to send troops to protect and evacuate overseas Chinese in the event of chaos. There is no intention to send troops to Shanghai to protect American official or private property. If the United States sends troops to Shanghai to maintain order on its behalf, then it must be decided by the State Department. No one here knows of such a decision or expects such a decision. Several hundred American businesses in Shanghai have considerable assets and would like to see American troops come to protect them. Even all Shanghai residents would welcome them, but the U.S. government has not yet expressed any intention of getting involved in the Chinese civil war. According to U.S. Navy officer Crawford, the fact that the United States continued to send Marine Corps to the Qingdao naval base was initially announced by Washington.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The State Department's instructions to Shanghai on the steps to protect American people and interests remained secret on the evening of the 7th. It had been generally expected that the State Department would issue a statement on this issue in the afternoon, but no statement was issued. A Navy Department spokesman said that whether to deploy the Marine Corps to protect American commercial industries in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Electric Power Company, is entirely up to the State Department. The State Department said that any statement on the whereabouts of the Marine Corps and how it will be used should be issued by the relevant authorities. The State Department pointed out that the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing and the Navy have been authorized to handle the evacuation of American expatriates, but the State Department here is currently unable to release the latest news on local developments.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] President issued an order on December 8th, stating that Lieutenant General Huang Baitao, Commander of the 7th Army Corps, was loyal and upright, with exceptional knowledge and fortitude, and deeply versed in military strategy. Having served in the military for a long time, he repeatedly confronted formidable enemies in the War of Resistance Against Japan and campaigns against bandits. He also participated in military planning, making outstanding contributions. He progressed through the ranks from regimental and brigade commander to war zone chief of staff, eventually assuming his current position. During the Xuzhou Campaign, the communists mobilized all their forces to disrupt the areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. Commander Huang personally led the troops, resolutely blocking the enemy. The entire army fought bravely and defended against the danger, eventually crushing the enemy's advance and stabilizing the battle situation. His contributions were immense. Unfortunately, his ambitions were cut short, and he died for his country. Having reviewed his last words, it is deeply regrettable. He should be posthumously commended by presidential decree and promoted to General. The Executive Yuan should instruct the Ministry of National Defense to provide generous compensation and condolences. His life's achievements should be recorded in the National History Museum to honor his loyalty and inspire future generations.</p>

Congressional sources say that the committee is highly concerned about the stolen documents on China policy and is considering the potential impact of their publication on the war in China. Informed sources say that the committee has concrete evidence proving that some documents have been stolen and sent to the Soviet Union for use by communists in the Far East.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Protecting Traffic Safety <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the turbulent situation, people are anxious, and the evacuation work by sea, land, and air has become unprecedentedly congested, resulting in a series of tragedies involving ships, planes, trains, and cars, causing great loss of life and property. This is a human tragedy and a misfortune for society! If the transportation and security authorities do not quickly control the evacuation, protect traffic safety, and stabilize people's hearts, then traffic chaos will create potential future troubles.</p>
<p>The current traffic chaos is unprecedented, especially the congestion of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou trains, and the overloading of ships heading to Hong Kong and Taiwan, which have already deviated from the normal track of transportation activities. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangya" ship, a large vessel operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, was carrying approximately 3,000 passengers to Ningbo on the night of the 3rd when it exploded in the Tongsha waters. According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the ship had a total of 2,565 passengers and 122 crew members. An estimated 1,600 passengers and 68 crew members are missing, mostly dead, either on the ship or sunk to the bottom of the sea. In addition, the Ningbo Compatriot Association has registered the names of over 2,000 passengers who died. This is undoubtedly an unprecedented tragedy. On the same day, a plane flying from Nanjing to Taiwan crashed at Taipei Airport, killing 25 passengers. The chaotic situation continued to occur. On the morning of the 5th, another train collision occurred near Wuxi Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, killing more than 30 people. At the same time, a long-distance bus traveling from Xicheng to Jiangyin crashed, killing seven and injuring twenty-eight. On the same afternoon at 5:53 PM, China Airlines Flight 538, a C-46 aircraft flying from Chongqing to Shanghai, was diverted to Jiangwan Airport due to heavy fog at Longhua Airport and the lack of radar equipment. Unfortunately, the fuselage struck a mound of earth next to the runway upon landing, killing ten and injuring eleven, including the pilot and passengers. In addition, there have been many other traffic accidents, such as people falling from trains and dying, or being caught in ship accidents. Although these events are unfortunate, they are certainly not accidental.</p>
<p>The direct cause of the continuous traffic accidents is the lack of planning for evacuation and transportation, the extreme disorder of management, and the unhealthy psychology of passengers. The indirect cause is problems with transportation facilities, which fail to fully meet people's needs. If the explosion of the "Jiangya" ship was not due to a problem with the boiler, or to some kind of explosive, then, regardless of whether it came from inside or outside the ship, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate and prevent future incidents. The Navy should have a strict responsibility to patrol the waterways outside Wusongkou and along the Yangtze and coastal areas. The causes of train and bus accidents on the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are mostly due to excessive ticket sales and unplanned evacuation. The unhealthy psychology of passengers is mostly due to a lack of awareness and a faulty view of life. When the battlefield is hundreds or thousands of miles away, this kind of running and fleeing is tantamount to seeking trouble. If this psychology does not change, it will not help traffic safety. In short, traffic safety is passenger safety; not only do the transportation and security agencies have a responsibility, but also the passengers themselves have a responsibility. Therefore, the first key to traffic safety is the restoration of social order and the calming of people's hearts.</p>
<p>The plane crashes at Jiangwan Airport and Taipei Airport are due to the lack of radar equipment at the airports, which is extremely unfortunate. At the end of the previous year and in the spring of last year, several Central and China Airlines planes crashed in Shanghai and Qingdao. This led to the establishment of the "Civil Aviation Administration," which prepared to install radar at various airports and to prepare various life-saving and safety technologies to reduce the risk of accidents. This time, two planes crashed in Shanghai and Taipei on the same day, due to heavy fog, and the fact that civil aviation equipment is still not perfect is undeniable.</p>
<p>Speaking of the responsibility for the repeated traffic accidents, from the perspective of administrative management and social morality, the sea, land, and air transportation agencies should bear direct and indirect responsibility. It is hoped that they will conduct an investigation on the one hand, and quickly compensate and comfort the passengers who died on the other hand. As for the future evacuation, it is an extremely important matter. It is hoped that the transportation and security agencies will carry out planned evacuations and conduct pre-checks and prepare for emergencies. Ticket sales must have an appropriate limit to ensure all is safe. In short, the country is currently in a difficult stage. In order to cope with the extraordinary situation, regulating traffic evacuation and protecting traffic safety is an urgent matter.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Recent rumors that the government is raising the price of gold exchange are completely untrue. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, gold exchange is being carried out in accordance with Article 11 of the "Revised Regulations for the Issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates": "Anyone who deposits Gold Yuan Certificates in a bank designated by the Central Bank, with a term of one year, will, in addition to receiving interest as stipulated, be able to exchange Gold Yuan of the same value as the deposit at the time of deposit with the deposit bank. Before the Gold Yuan can be raised, gold or silver coins may be exchanged at the prescribed ratio." Currently, major cities are handling this matter in accordance with this regulation. The government has not considered changing the exchange price or the amount of deposits. Rumors of raising the price of gold exchange are purely rumors spread by villains who hope to profit and are not credible.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] The rush to buy gold at the Hangzhou Central Bank is still fierce, almost entirely dominated by scalpers. The soldiers and civilians who rushed to buy on the 8th had disputes due to grabbing territory, and hundreds of people fought each other.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 8th] Today, the exchange of gold and silver at national banks here is even more crowded, especially at the Central Bank, where the order is the most chaotic. More than 2,000 customers fought each other, and more than a dozen were injured. Although the military police suppressed the crowd, they had not been dispersed by the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 8th] Although national banks continue to exchange silver dollars as usual, the rising trend is still strong, reaching 66 yuan today. To exchange silver dollars, disputes have occurred repeatedly in front of national banks. This morning, more than a thousand destitute students demanded early exchange, which caused some tension. The military police then rescued the situation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 8th] Credit in the city is surprisingly loose, with black market interest rates falling sharply. Lenders are also cautious about bad debts.

There are currently 260 rice and paddy ships, with approximately 200,000 dan, blocked in Yuxikou, Anhui Province. On the 8th, He Wangshu came to Wuxi, and grain merchants appealed to He. He promised to request the Ministry of Food to find a way to release the ships to meet the urgent need. In addition, the market situation has improved slightly. White glutinous rice is 293 yuan, white wheat is 235 yuan, flour is 102 yuan, soybean oil is 850 yuan, and cotton yarn is 7,750 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] Rice prices have rebounded slightly after declining.

The closing price of flour is 106 yuan. Cotton yarn initially rose and then fell. This morning, Tian Guan, a cotton yarn company, sold a future contract for 7,200 yuan. In the afternoon, a future contract for tomorrow was only sold for 6,850 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 8th] Rice prices in Zhenjiang are trending stable.

<h3 id="e39">Zheng Daoru Discusses Mission to Shanghai; Financial Affairs, Food, and Coal Storage, Southern Transportation of Tobacco Should Be Comprehensively Resolved; Military and Civilians in North China Are Calm on the Eve of a Great Storm <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zheng Daoru, Secretary-General of the North China Pacification Headquarters, has been in Shanghai for several days on official business. Zheng recently told reporters that the main purpose of this trip was to discuss relevant matters with the headquarters of the Central Bank. After arriving in Shanghai, he visited President Yu, Vice President Liu, and various bureau and department heads. Today, he read in the newspaper about the gold and silver rushes in Peiping and Tianjin. He said that such problems must be resolved here. Regarding the military situation in the North, Zheng said that it was not within his scope of work and declined to analyze it, but believed that the burden on the National Army in North China had indeed increased after Lin Biao's troops entered the Pass. However, he believed that the fighting power and morale of the troops under Commander Fu Zuoyi were excellent, and they were assisted by other elite central troops. The recent victory at Zhangjiakou gave Nie Rongzhen's lightly advancing troops a head-on blow. From General Fu Zuoyi down, the headquarters were calm and confident, so although North China was on the eve of a great storm, people's hearts remained fairly stable. Regarding the economic problems in the North, Secretary Zheng believed that finance, finance, and economy were integrated and must be comprehensively resolved. The most pressing problem at present is to find a way to transport coal from the North to the South and to solve the food supply for North China. The Kailuan Coal Mine produces about 400,000 tons per month, and currently has about one million tons in storage. Storage and care are very laborious. If it is not shipped out, there is a danger of it "bursting." The difficulty lies in the heavy military transport, and the transportation problem is difficult to solve. After the end of the war in the Northeast, the large amount of sea transport has decreased, and it is hoped that the coal transport problem can be solved. Today, the South is experiencing a coal shortage, and it is naturally necessary to transport coal from the North to the South. The US aid ration for Peiping and Tianjin in December was originally scheduled to begin in the middle of the month. The distribution of rice is a major stabilizing factor, and it is hoped that it will not be interrupted to reassure people. Zheng will remain in Shanghai for several days. After Administrator Hoffman of the Joint Economic Aid Administration arrives in Shanghai, he will provide some information about North China. After completing his official business in Shanghai, he plans to go to Nanjing for a trip and return to Peiping next week.</p>

<p>Caused by Careless Fire-Making by Guards</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 7th] Regarding the explosion at the Nanyuan Airport oil and bomb depot last night, the official did not continue to issue a public announcement today, but reporters learned from official sources that the cause of the fire was that the guards in the southeastern corner of the airport carelessly made a fire, causing the grass where gasoline was usually spilled to catch fire, which then spread to the gasoline and bombs. Because there were many heavy bombs among them, the shock was extremely strong, so that the citizens of Tianjin also felt the earthquake twice. The airport's command post was in the southeastern corner of the airport and separated by a runway, so there was no loss. The airport's planes were far away from the fire and were all safe. The official did not announce the number of deaths and injuries. According to Zhang Liansheng, the magistrate of Daxing County, nearby, he heard that three people died and more than ten were injured.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Cui Shuyan, the Commissioner for the Northeastern Administrative Office of the Supervisory Yuan, who escaped from Shenyang in disguise after it fell, has arrived in Nanjing via Qinhuangdao and Peiping, reporting to the Supervisory Yuan on the conclusion of the Northeastern Administrative Office and explaining the responsibility for the failure of the war in the Northeast. Cui met with reporters on the 8th, explaining the various situations he witnessed before and after Shenyang fell. Cui believes that the responsibility for the fact that senior generals and government leaders such as Wei Lihuang quietly left Shenyang by plane on the 30th, leaving the military and government personnel in Shenyang, should be investigated. Cui said that on the evening of the 30th, when he drove through the city, he saw 150 armored vehicles and 500 trucks fully equipped and waiting for orders from their superiors to charge outward. But who knew that from that moment on, the orders were not given and the city was immediately seized. Cui expressed his extreme distress at the abandonment of this large amount of military weapons and ammunition. However, he defended the various rumors about Zhou Fucheng, commander of the 53rd Army. On the evening of the 30th, Commander Zhou's army was still fighting and winning at Dongling Airport. After returning to the city, he wanted to report to his superiors, but no one listened to his report. On the 31st, two of Zhou's three divisions mutinied. Zhou cried all night, saying, "I will fight to the end!"

<h3 id="e59">Jiang Tingfu Appeals to the United Nations for Assistance in Achieving Korean Unification, Sino-Australian Proposal Receives Majority Support, Soviet Union Submits Counter-Proposal Requesting the Abolition of the Korean Commission <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 8th (Broadcast): The UN Political Committee met on the afternoon of the 8th, ignoring the condemnation by Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Yugoslavia of the United States' actions in Korea. Only twelve committee members attended. The majority of countries led by the United States intend to leave the communist bloc's condemnation unanswered in order to expedite the vote.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] During the UN Political Committee's debate on the Korean issue today, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu stated, "Dividing Korea into two, with one-third of the people belonging to North Korea and two-thirds belonging to South Korea, is unprecedented in Korean history. The iron curtain separating North and South Korea, preventing the people from both sides from interacting with each other, is also the greatest tragedy in the entire history of mankind." The Chinese representative acknowledged the May 10th election in South Korea as a "democratic election" and that the parliament produced by the election is a "representative democratic institution." He stated, "President Syngman Rhee's government is indeed a representative government. However, this work that has already begun is currently not yet fully completed, so the UN General Assembly should appoint a new committee to continue its efforts."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] The joint proposal by China, the United States, and Australia has received the support of ten countries. In addition to the three countries that proposed it, Britain, France, India, Burma, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Brazil, and Dominica have also expressed their agreement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] During his speech to the UN Political Committee on the 8th, Soviet representative Malik accused the United States of establishing a police state in the occupied southern part of Korea and attempting to cover it up with "lies." Malik also protested the United Nations Korean Commission's support of the United States' "terrorist acts and reactionaries" in South Korea, and he proposed the abolition of the commission. Malik pointed out that the Korean Commission not only failed to work towards the unification of North and South Korea, but instead divided them and forced elections in the US-occupied area of South Korea. He stated, "Some delegations have ulterior motives, attempting to suppress opinions and conceal the facts. Dulles calmly tells us that the US delegation hates terror, but who believes his lies? Look at how many people were arrested, tortured, killed, and maimed after the May 10th general election in South Korea. Dulles is truly emulating the methods of the Japanese." Malik also criticized Dulles for selling the "myth" of Korean communist atrocities to the Political Committee. He retorted, "Why is this? It is to intimidate those with wavering wills, to cover up the repressive terrorist policies wherever the American footprints have reached. Korea, Germany, and Italy have all suffered from it." When Malik proposed the abolition of the Korean Commission, he criticized the commission for failing to eliminate the consequences of 40 years of Japanese occupation. The Soviet proposal is diametrically opposed to the Sino-Australian proposal, which advocates that the Korean Commission should supervise the early withdrawal of US and Soviet troops. Malik stated that the purpose of the United States' submission of the three-nation proposal is to "enable US troops to be stationed in Korea for a long time." He pointed out that the Soviet Union had requested the simultaneous withdrawal of both countries, but the United States refused, and he acknowledged that US troops may "permanently" remain in Korea. He also stated, "The Americans are building Korea thousands of miles away from their country as a springboard for expansion, and they are enjoying themselves so much that they don't want to leave. The Korean Commission is everywhere protecting this ambition of the United States and concealing the truth about the puppet government of South Korea." In addition to his vehement criticism, Malik also stated that the South Korean police are controlled by those who once fawned upon the Japanese and are using the tortures of the Japanese army. He also stated that South Korea is a "police shooting range."</p>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 8th] President Syngman Rhee took preliminary steps on the 8th to apply for membership in the United Nations. He has instructed the Korean representative to the United Nations to "formally apply for United Nations membership."</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 8th] Foreign Minister Zhang Ze Xiang of the Republic of Korea challenged the Soviet Union on the 8th, demanding that the Soviet Union "remove the iron curtain currently erected on the 38th parallel" and allow the United Nations to determine whether the North Korean communist regime is democratic and free. Zhang stated that the Soviet and Ukrainian representatives' descriptions of the "tide of terror" in South Korea in the United Nations General Assembly are "the means by which the communist comrades of the above representatives treat the peace-loving people of Korea, and the only crime of the Koreans is to participate in voting." The South Korean government has generally not directly criticized the Soviet Union, but now it has "reached the point of no return" and has come out to refute. Zhang pointed out that President Syngman Rhee's government was elected by the people under the supervision of the United Nations Korean Commission. "If the United States truly has weapons in its hands, then the edge of the blade will definitely point to the countries that are hindering the normal progress of the Republic of Korea and will never point to the Korean people."</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] A fire broke out in the United Nations committee room in the basement of the Palais de Chaillot on the 7th after hours of heated debate. Although the damage was minor, it caused considerable alarm. Fearing the flames and the potential for the fire to spread, the officials in charge of security moved officials and journalists elsewhere. Fortunately, the fire brigade, together with the fire brigade stationed in the palace, was able to control the fire within an hour, limiting the damage to the room where the fire started.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] United Nations headquarters officials said that the conference room in the Palais de Chaillot was severely damaged and unusable after being burned on the night of the 7th. However, since the UN General Assembly is only four days away from closing, it will not be a problem even if it cannot be repaired in time. The cause of the fire is unknown, but the point of origin was a coil of wires, causing $1,500 in damage.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The ushers at the United Nations headquarters at the Palais de Chaillot went on strike for one hour today, demanding increased wages. They were recruited by the French government to work during the UN General Assembly. Some of the staff at one of the palace's restaurants and cafes also went on a brief strike today.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] According to reliable sources who spoke to reporters: Tojo and the other six war criminals will not be executed by hanging this year. The US Supreme Court, which accepted the appeals of Doihara and others, may take a month to deliberate and make a decision on this issue. Before the Supreme Court makes a final decision, the seven war criminals will not be executed. The source pointed out that MacArthur stated yesterday that his statement postponing the execution is still valid.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] After the news that the US Supreme Court accepted the Japanese war criminals' case spread here, Matthias, the American lawyer defending war criminal Iwane Matsui, stated: "The US Supreme Court justices voted on whether to accept the defense's appeal documents. As for whether the Japanese war criminals' appeal should be heard, a decision will have to wait until the 16th."</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] People from all walks of life in Japan have expressed deep pleasure over the US Supreme Court's acceptance of the Japanese war criminals' appeal. In general, they not only hope that this can delay the execution date of Tojo and others, but they also further speculate on the intentions of the US action. Some even boldly predict that the United States will find a way to acquit the Japanese war criminals of the death penalty, that is, not to carry out the death penalty. Once the international political situation changes, this group of war criminals can be used again. Not only are ordinary people making wild speculations, but on the 7th, Judge Morizawa of the Chiba District Court also publicly stated that the organization and trial of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal for War Criminals violated the US Constitution. Such arguments are not only far-fetched, but where does it place the international tribunal organized by the eleven United Nations countries? The main reason why ordinary Japanese people dare to make such statements is the US Supreme Court's decision to accept the Japanese war criminals' appeal.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] The French cabinet is scheduled to make a final decision on next year's budget on the 8th, while dissatisfaction among the press is increasing and rumors are spreading that the government is divided on the budget proposal. The ministers will hold their third meeting in three days this afternoon. The government is facing a particular problem, which is that it must raise 350 billion francs under the Marshall Plan for construction and industrial equipment. The government is keeping the fundraising secret, but the press is rumored to be planning to use two methods: "forced loans" and massive tax increases.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Since the US Supreme Court decided to accept the appeals of Doihara and Hirota, the defendants' attorneys at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal are actively preparing to make a final effort for the Japanese war criminals.

A frustrated British figure here believes that this move is an insult to one of the United States' wartime allies.

<p>[United Press, Norfolk, Virginia, 7th] US Air Force Secretary Symington said on the 7th: "Remember Pearl Harbor" is a "motto" for the government when making fateful military and diplomatic decisions. He said, "Let no one anywhere in the world think that the United States has forgotten the meaning of today. For those who determine our military and diplomatic destiny, from the President to all colleagues in the State Department and the Department of Defense, this is in fact the backbone of our considerations and planning."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] In a broadcast commemorating the Pearl Harbor incident, General Wainwright said that the United States should have sufficient strength in the future to discourage any world aggressor.</p>

The atomic factories in the northwest and many cities and ports on the Pacific coast do not have enough defense forces."

Eleven countries voted in favor of having the Special Political Committee debate the issue, 31 countries voted against, 7 countries were absent, and 9 countries abstained.

<p>[United Press Sydney, 7th] Philippine representative to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE), Mr. Jaleco, issued a warning today opposing MacArthur's favoritism towards Japan's reconstruction. He stated that no country suffered as much devastation at the hands of the Japanese army during the war as the Philippines. While developing Japan's foreign trade is a natural trend, its people should not enjoy pre-war living standards until Japan has completed its reparations. All proposals for rebuilding Japanese trade must be thoroughly reviewed to prevent Japan from becoming the supreme political power in the East. MacArthur's encouragement of private Japanese trade to reduce occupation costs is understandable, but it should not obstruct fair compensation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] After presiding over the Food Conference yesterday, Mayor Wu met with reporters at 6 PM and solemnly denied the rumors from Nanjing that rice allocation would be suspended in December. He stated: "I guarantee that rice allocation in this city will continue this month. The above news is absolutely untrue." He also reiterated that the nature of this rice allocation is not relief, but rather to supplement rice sources. Therefore, the allocated price will still be based on the original agreement, which is 95% of the average market price for the last five days of each month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Committee solemnly denied to reporters on the 8th the rumors from Nanjing that grain allocation in the six major cities would be temporarily suspended in December. He stated that he had no knowledge of this news. He believes that this news is a misrepresentation of another piece of information, namely that the grain allocation for Tianjin and Beijing will no longer be supplied by the government from December of this year to March of next year, but will be fully funded by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA). Starting in April, the government will continue to supply it. In addition, the grain allocation in Qingdao will also be fully funded by the Economic Cooperation Administration in the future. The spokesperson said that the grain allocation in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing will continue in December and will not be interrupted.</p>

<p>The distribution of rice ration cards for November in this city was completed on the 5th.

The inspection work has now been completed, and a review was held yesterday at the Civil Food Allocation Office. (1) The distribution of cards based on the new ID cards was very convenient. (2) Accuracy was greatly improved, and there was no case of impersonation or substitution. (3) The knowledge and ability of the Baojia personnel in the urban area were higher, but their work ethic was not as good as that in the suburbs. (4) The best performance in card distribution city-wide was in the 6th Bao and 15th Bao of the New Urban District, followed by the 23rd Bao and 21st Jia of Huangpu District. (5) The areas with the most errors in card distribution were the 19th Bao, 23rd Jia, and 17th Jia of Yangshupu District. The team hopes that in the future, the district Baojia personnel will thoroughly study the announcements of the Civil Food Allocation Office in advance, so as to reduce errors and achieve better results.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Thirteen foreign banks in this city, including Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, previously provided opinions on the Ministry of Finance's order to adjust capital in accordance with the Regulations for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls.

All commercial banks and firms should comply uniformly, without differentiation based on nationality.

Mayor Wu, Chen Daqing, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Xiaosong, Xu Ji, Du Yuesheng, Luo Qinghua, and others attended. According to Mayor Wu, when meeting with reporters at 6 PM, the meeting discussed the issue of public security in the city. The important resolutions are as follows: (1) To strengthen the maintenance of order at various railway stations and docks in the city, to be the responsibility of the Garrison Command. (2) Regarding the issue of accommodating stray soldiers and vagrants in the city, it was decided that the Garrison Command would convene the Civil Affairs Bureau and local social organizations to discuss and decide on arrangements, and to temporarily provide relief to those sent to the shelter.

<h3 id="e87">Depositors Must Present ID to Exchange for Gold and Silver; Silver Yuan Limited to One Exchange; No Restrictions on Gold <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank, due to the increasing congestion of depositors exchanging money, contacted the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China to change the exchange method. Anyone seeking to exchange paper money must present an ID card to be issued an application form. The ID card will be stamped once issued. Silver yuan are limited to one exchange, with a maximum amount of 49 silver yuan. Those whose ID cards have already been stamped by any of the four banks for silver yuan exchange will not be allowed to exchange again. However, there are no restrictions on the exchange of gold. Although the exchange of gold also requires a stamp on the ID card, the stamp is only for record-keeping purposes and does not imply restrictions. Regarding the exchange procedures for military personnel and police officers, the national banks have also contacted the Military and Police Affairs Bureau to handle it separately. It is believed that after changing the method, the congestion situation may improve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the four banks started handling deposit and exchange services, many people have been entrusting familiar colleagues within the four banks to exchange money on their behalf. As the deposit and exchange business becomes more prosperous day by day, the requests for assistance have also increased, and the banks are overwhelmed. Therefore, starting recently, the bank authorities have strictly stipulated that colleagues within the bank are not allowed to accept entrustments for exchange on behalf of others. Even if colleagues need to exchange money themselves, they must queue up and wait for the exchange as ordinary citizens, otherwise they will be dismissed and investigated.</p>

<p>Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, recently stated that at the entrances of designated banks that handle the deposit and exchange of gold and silver, there are often large numbers of military personnel with disheveled uniforms, competing to be the first to exchange, which not only damages the reputation of the military but also disrupts order. In order to prevent those with bad intentions from impersonating military personnel, a method for military personnel to deposit and exchange gold and silver is stipulated, effective immediately. The Garrison Command issued a public notice yesterday, stating that those who violate this method will be arrested by the military police maintaining order at the scene and will not be tolerated. The method for military personnel to deposit and exchange gold and silver is as follows: (1) All military personnel who wish to deposit and exchange gold and silver must first come to the Garrison Command to register and obtain a permit before depositing and exchanging at the designated bank. (2) All formal active-duty officers and soldiers with symbols or ID cards must bring various documents that can prove their identity to the Second Section of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command to complete the registration procedures and issue a permit for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. (3) Military personnel who have been permitted to deposit and exchange money should proceed to the designated banks in accordance with the serial number of the permit to complete the deposit and exchange procedures. (4) Any military personnel who go to exchange money without permission will be deemed as stray soldiers and vagrants and will be arrested by the military police maintaining order at the scene and sent to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Command for strict punishment. (5) All officers and soldiers who have registered must not register repeatedly; violators will be severely punished. (6) All military personnel who hold a permit must have their signature on the permit verified by the depositing bank to ensure that the signature matches before the exchange can be made; otherwise, the depositing bank may refuse the exchange. (7) The gold and silver exchange permit must be affixed with the seal of the Garrison Command. (8) Police officers and policemen will be handled separately by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Commissioner Yu Shuping of the Municipal Police Bureau stipulated yesterday that all officers and policemen of the Bureau who wish to deposit and exchange gold and silver must first register with the Headquarters and, after verification, be issued a permit to proceed to the designated bank for deposit and exchange procedures.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Nearly Three Thousand Passengers Registered as Victims of the Jiangya Ship Disaster; Another One Hundred and Seven Bodies Recovered Yesterday; Relief Committee Accuses China Merchants Steam Navigation Company of Negligence; Families Passionately Appeal for Justice <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The "Guoshan" Tug No. 50 carried 107 bodies recovered from the site of the sunken Jiangya ship to Shanghai. It was scheduled to dock at the Third Wharf, but due to the large number of family members gathered at the Third Wharf, over 3,000, for fear of accidents, it was temporarily changed to dock at the First Wharf, and the bodies were transported to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for family members to identify. In addition, the Bureau received a telegram from Wusong yesterday afternoon, stating that ten floating bodies were found at the naval dock. The Bureau immediately dispatched the "Feikang" tugboat to salvage them. It had not returned to Shanghai by the evening and is expected to return this morning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the Jiangya ship disaster relief work, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association of this city expressed strong dissatisfaction with the slow response of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It has organized the Jiangya Ship Disaster Relief Committee, which has set up legal, publicity, general affairs, registration, salvage, and funeral groups to actively carry out the work. The legal group of the committee quickly collected reports from survivors and believed that the truth of the disaster did not match the rumors from various parties. Yesterday afternoon, three lawyers representing the group, Chu Shun, Xia Gongkai, and Zheng Lin, hosted reporters to report on everything. They first pointed out that the Jiangya ship's passenger capacity was limited to 1,600 people, according to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, as of last night, the committee had officially registered over 2,900 passengers who died in the disaster, which proves that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was too negligent in preventing overloading beforehand and should bear the responsibility for negligence. Regarding the location of the explosion, they also criticized the experts who only relied on surface surveys to conclude that it was not a boiler explosion, which is not credible. At the same time, survivors Tang Shengsong, Xia Wenbing, and others presented several eyewitness accounts to prove that the explosion was internal rather than external: (1) There was no gunpowder smell at the time of the explosion. (2) Those who escaped last saw that the explosion site was turned outward rather than inward. (3) The radio operator on the Jiangya ship was also killed in the explosion. The radio operator's room was located on a higher level of the ship, which could not be reached by the power of a water mine. (4) The sound of the explosion was not continuous, and the sound of the distress whistle was unusually short. The ship sank very quickly after the explosion. All of these are symptoms of a boiler explosion. Subsequently, a chemical engineer from the Xinguang Rong Factory, one of the survivors, explained the possibility of a boiler explosion, saying: The "scale" on the inner layer of ordinary boilers is extremely dangerous. If there is a crack of 0.5 mm wide and 100 cm long, 2 cc of water can enter the scale gap and turn into 4 liters of gas. At a temperature of 180 degrees, it produces a pressure of 41,540 pounds, which is enough to cause the boiler to explode. He also said that, as far as he knew, the Jiangya ship was due for repairs this year, but the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had not made any repairs, so it could not be said that there were no cracks in the scale inside the boiler. He also said that there is a "horizontal" type of boiler, which means that its upper chimney may not fall after an explosion. Therefore, according to the fact that the chimney is intact, it cannot be said that it was not a boiler explosion.</p>
<p>The association stated that in order to thoroughly resolve this doubt, today it will invite relevant authorities and representatives from all walks of life to go to the scene of the accident by boat and hire divers to explore the water to see the actual situation of the explosion site, which will be made public to society to determine the issue of responsibility. At yesterday's reception, when the representatives denied the results of the expert investigation the day before, the family members of the victims listening in were all passionate. They all stated that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's measures before and after the Jiangya ship accident were inappropriate, and the relief work was repeatedly delayed. Therefore, they appealed to all walks of life to uphold justice and urge the company to proceed quickly, so that this unprecedented painful lesson can serve as a warning to the shipping industry and strengthen the safety of navigation in our country in the future.</p>

<p>The International Civil Aviation Conference held in New Delhi on the 25th of last month concluded on the 3rd. Our delegates Wang Zhu, Chief Secretary of the China National Aviation Corporation, and engineer Hua Zhu, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon at approximately 4 PM. According to Wang, the main topics of the conference were all related to international civil aviation technology. The main content can be divided into four categories: (1) related to navigation, (2) related to area control, (3) related to communication, and (4) related to rescue. The conference was attended by 48 countries, with each country represented by more than 10 delegates, but our country had fewer delegates. At the conference, each delegate fiercely debated for the benefit of their own country on every issue. For example, with regard to area control, the conference had initially designated South China as part of the Hong Kong control area, but after strenuous efforts by Wang and others, it was re-designated as the Guangzhou area. Otherwise, it would not be possible to maintain the secrecy of any type of flight in the airspace over South China in the future.</p>

From 10 AM to 6 PM today, all teams that have not collected their balls may collect them from Chen Linsheng at the Hualian Tongle Association, No. 194 Nanjing East Road. No further extensions will be granted. The second registration will begin on the 25th of this month, and applications will be accepted. The list of teams making a make-up collection is as follows:</p>
<p>Hemp Industry, Police Communications, Five Stars, New Star, Silk Industry, Quanlu, Normal School, Zhongnong, Chongben, St. John's, Infantry, Yongwu B, Jewish, Youxing.</p>

<p>In the first match of the second Yinqian Cup table tennis finals, Zhejiang faced Shanghai. The game was held at the Zhongnong ball room at 6 PM the night before. Zhejiang was last year's runner-up, and Shanghai was this year's emerging force. Shanghai had previously defeated Citibank to win the silver group runner-up. Unfortunately, due to the absence of the key players Yang Yongkang and Wang Junhao, they lost to Zhejiang 13-2. Chen Honggao, Sun Jue, and Xie Pan Village of Zhejiang each achieved a three-game winning streak, setting an undefeated record. For Shanghai, the main player Lu Jixing defeated Zhu Xuejing, the captain of the Zhejiang team, and Ling Kecheng cleverly defeated Wei Kejunn of Zhejiang, which can be considered a difficult achievement. There will be two more finals tonight. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e132">Two Major Events in Jiangsu Province: Grain Administration and Military Service Administration Progressing Steadily <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, He Xianglin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] The suppression of the rebellion has reached a crucial point. The battlefront has extended to Xuzhou-Bengbu, Jiangsu, a forward position, marking a battle for defense. The great victory in this campaign has further solidified the confidence in the ultimate success of the overall rebellion suppression. Undoubtedly, people across the country today are deeply concerned about Jiangsu, which is also affecting the future of the entire situation in China. In order to grasp this central issue, this reporter will report on the two most important major events currently in Jiangsu as follows:</p>
<p>First, Grain Administration</p>
<p>It cannot be considered poor. Although the banditry is not yet suppressed and the environment is special, the amount of grain allocated by the central government can still be collected at eighty to ninety percent annually. In the performance evaluation of grain administration nationwide, it is considered a relatively acceptable area. According to Deputy Director Hong of the Provincial Land and Grain Department, "This is due on the one hand to the efforts of the authorities, and on the other hand to the enthusiastic payment by the people. Although there are households who delay and procrastinate, they ultimately account for a very small minority." According to the reporter's investigation: the collection figures for this year, up to now, are not even half a year old. One reason is that the starting period for collection this year was relatively late, and the second is because the administrative expenses of various counties are strained, and some counties have had to allocate a portion of the collected rice in advance to cover administrative expenses. However, the military situation this year is much more tense than in the same period last year. The front lines need military rations, which cannot be described by the words "extremely urgent." The central government's orders must not be delayed and must be collected in full as scheduled. If the handling is not effective, it will be dealt with by military law. Therefore, the Provincial Land and Grain Department sent personnel to various counties and cities to supervise the collection, which was not enough. Chairman Ding was also requested to send directors and commissioners from various departments to depart for different areas immediately to supervise and urge the collection, in order to collect the full amount as required.</p>
<p>Grain Collection Areas</p>
<p>Due to military reasons, Jiangsu is divided into three types: pacification zones, those treated as pacification zones, and others. For the twenty-two counties and cities designated as pacification zones, in order to adapt to the needs of the situation, the Provincial Land and Grain Department has drafted provisional measures for the collection of field tax in various counties and cities of the Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone for the 37th year, and ordered them to be followed, so that counties where public security is unstable can have a basis when they are unable to implement the regulations stipulated by the central government. Secondly, although the eight counties and cities in northern Jiangsu, such as Haimen, Jingjiang, and Nantong, have not been designated as pacification zones by the central government, the public security situation in each county and city is the same as those in the pacification zones. The provincial government has repeatedly listed the facts and requested the central government to include them in the pacification zones, but although it has not been approved, in order to take into account the facts, the provincial government committee has also resolved to handle them as counties in the pacification zones. The remaining twenty-four counties in southern Jiangsu, such as Suzhou, Jiangning, Lishui, Changshu, Gaochun, Jinshan, Jintan, Yangzhou, Liyang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, Jiangpu, Jiangyin, Yixing, Wuxi, Wujiang, Wujin, Danyang, Jurong, Yizheng, Jiangdu, and Liuhe, will continue to collect in kind for this year's field tax in accordance with the laws and regulations stipulated by the central government. The eight counties of Baoshan, Jiading, Fengxian, Nanhui, Shanghai, Chongming, Taicang, and Chuansha will continue to collect in currency according to the established practice of the previous year.</p>
<p>Types of Field Tax Collection in this Province,</p>
<p>Types of Collection in Kind</p>
<p>Are divided into three types: rice, wheat, and corn: (1) Counties collecting rice: (1) Non-pacification zone, Suzhou, Jiangning, etc., twenty-four counties. (2) Pacification zone, Taixing, Huaian, etc., seven counties. (3) Treated as Pacification Zone - Lianyungang City. (2) Counties and cities collecting wheat - Tongshan, Donghai, etc., four counties. (3) Counties collecting corn: Pacification zone is Guanyun, treated as pacification zone is Haimen. (4) Counties collecting currency: Non-pacification zone is Baoshan, Jiading, Fengxian, Nanhui, Shanghai, Chongming, Taicang, Chuansha, etc., eight counties. Pacification zone is Dongtai, Rugao, Qidong, treated as pacification zone is Nantong.</p>
<p>Assessment of Collection Rates</p>
<p>As follows: (1) Counties collecting rice, each yuan of tax, collect 1.2 dou of rice, 0.9 dou for borrowing, 0.48 dou for public grain, totaling 2.58 dou for actual collection (borrowing is temporarily exempted in the pacification zone) (2) Counties collecting wheat: calculated at 70% of rice, each yuan of tax, collect 0.84 dou of actual grain, 0.63 dou for borrowing, 0.34 dou for public grain, totaling 1.81 dou for actual collection, 0.432 dou for public grain, totaling 3.322 dou for actual collection, (4) Accumulated grain is collected at 10% of the actual collection (collection is temporarily postponed in the pacification zone)</p>
<p>The collection of field tax this year started in November and has collected one-tenth of the total amount so far, which is 267.307 shi of in-kind grain. Now, due to the urgent need for military rations in the central region, it is required to complete the full amount within two months. Dou Dayou, the food department's supervisor stationed in the province, has gone to various counties north and south of the Yangtze River to urge collection, and must collect the full amount as scheduled.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Military Service Administration</p>
<p>Can be said to be on the right track. In the past, each round of conscription could not escape the manipulation of "recruit brokers," which led to the phenomenon of over-recruitment. The Ministry of National Defense paid extreme attention to this and repeatedly ordered various military divisions and garrison areas to strictly prevent it. Recently, President Chiang, considering that the suppression of the rebellion has reached a crucial point, issued an emergency call for manpower mobilization, ordering conscription agencies in various provinces and cities to pre-conscript a portion of the new recruits for the 38th year. Jiangsu needs to conscript a total of 12,000 people. The Southern Jiangsu Garrison Area has been ordered to conscript 4,800 people, starting comprehensive conscription and enlistment on the first of this month and completing it in one go by the fifteenth. At the same time, in order to avoid deserters posing as volunteers and wasting local financial resources, it has been decided to conduct lotteries for this conscription and stipulate:</p>
<p>Six Measures</p>
<p>(1) Conscript more and faster, only allowing advancement, not allowing lagging behind. (2) Effectively prevent spies. (3) Absolutely no substitution is allowed. (4) Deserters will be executed if captured. (5) County and city military service associations are responsible for reporting conscription fraud and handling rewards and punishments. (6) Effectively implement preferential treatment for conscripted families.</p>
<p>The authorities are actively deploying their full strength on these two major events, and the reporter silently wishes that this time it can definitely be completed successfully as scheduled, setting an example. Finally, as an aside, Jiangsu has entered a wartime system at this stage. The central government recently announced that Chairman Su, Ding Zhi-pan, will concurrently serve as the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, and it is expected that close coordination between the party, government, and military in Jiangsu in the future is undoubtedly assured.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 6th] Chen Guinan, a native of Nansha Township, Jiangyin, has been selling firewood. On the 5th, Chen bought another boatload of firewood, loaded it in Cheng, and transported it to Xixi, mooring it under the North Xinqiao River in Zhoushanbang. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 AM on the 5th, a middle-aged man, stark naked, suddenly boarded the boat asking for clothes and food. Chen firmly refused. The man then hid in the cabin. Later, at 5:00 PM, when preparing to cook dinner, Chen went to the street to buy rice, and the boatman Luo Decai also went ashore to fetch things, leaving Chen's ten-year-old son, Longxing, on the boat. Seeing that there was no one on the boat, the man grabbed a bamboo knife and slashed at Longxing, inflicting six cuts on the head and two cuts on the hands. Brain matter splattered, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and he died instantly. Decai returned to the boat first and was shocked by the scene, shouting for help. People on the shore heard the cries and rushed onto the firewood boat, taking control of the assailant. They immediately rushed to the local Ren'ai Town Self-Defense Corps and sent officers to arrest him. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, the man jumped into the river when he went ashore, intending to commit suicide, but was rescued and interrogated by the team. According to his confession: his name is Liao Yuxi, 37 years old, from Dabu, Guangdong. He was a private first class in the headquarters of the Youth Army 202nd Division. He came to Xixi last night and fell into a latrine in the dark, so he was not wearing clothes. Because the boat owner did not give him clothes and food, he killed the child to vent his anger, and now he is willing to pay for his life, etc. Town Chief Zhu Zuwu, according to the confession, determined that the case concerned a major crime and decided to submit it to the city defense headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Is Hong Kong a Safe Haven? Naval, Land, and Air Forces and Police Hold Joint Exercise <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 7th (Airmail)] On the eve of the Pacific War, Hong Kong frequently held "military exercises." How long ago was that? Now, seven years later, it has "reappeared" with residents for the first time. Although the authorities solemnly stated that "they will avoid causing inconvenience to residents as much as possible," when residents woke up and saw the news of a large-scale exercise with the headline "Troops Acting as Rioters Attack Police" in various newspapers, they could not help but feel a little uneasy.</p>
<p>This joint exercise of the naval, land, and air forces and police started on the 6th and will be held successively in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories for about a week. Starting on the morning of the 6th, the entire Hong Kong was declared in</p>
<p>A State of Emergency</p>
<p>The battle for Hong Kong Island is expected to be completed within two days. "Reactionaries" will attack government buildings, radio stations, power stations, and attempt to occupy important centers such as public utilities and police stations. Following the battle for Hong Kong, a similar exercise will be held on the Kowloon Peninsula. The battle for the New Territories will be even larger in scale. The navy and army will attempt a landing, while the air force will drop parachutes to drop food and supplies to the defending forces. The defenders of Hong Kong will engage in a "mock battle" with reactionaries who have infiltrated British territory and British territorial waters, and destroy the "bandits'" hiding places.</p>
<p>According to Sing Tao Daily: "The British Army Headquarters in Southeast Asia attaches great importance to Hong Kong's defense issues. Recently, the British Commissioner for Southeast Asia convened a meeting to discuss issues, with Hong Kong as the main theme. Recently, General Wright, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Southeast Asia, came to Hong Kong and consulted with Major General Maddocks, Commander-in-Chief of the</p>
<p>Land Forces</p>
<p>To discuss this exercise and plan everything, in order to test Hong Kong's defense capabilities. This exercise to prevent bandit riots is the result of the consultation and is one of the main issues discussed at the meeting convened by the British Commissioner for Southeast Asia regarding Hong Kong." It can be seen that the Hong Kong authorities' holding of this military exercise is the result of considerable consideration and preparation. The newspaper also stated:</p>
<p>"Recently, due to the continued expansion of the Communist Party's forces in China and the rumors caused by the robbery cases along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, the public security on the border between China and Hong Kong has suddenly been seriously threatened. The Hong Kong authorities cannot but strengthen the deployment of troops in Hong Kong in order to cope with any unexpected events. According to sources familiar with the matter, multiple batches of military firearms and equipment have been transported from Singapore and the United Kingdom to Hong Kong in the past month, including anti-aircraft guns, gas masks, ammunition, and military supplies, which were unloaded and put into warehouses, ready to be distributed to various units during the day."</p>
<p>Some people in the mainland are taking Hong Kong</p>
<p>As a "Shangri-La"</p>
<p>And running here from afar, while Hong Kong announces this exercise full of gunpowder, it is such a contradictory thing. At the same time as this news was announced, the Associated Press correspondent in Hong Kong published a long article, based on his "results of interviewing government officials, economists, Kuomintang members, and Communist Party members, and they all agreed that "Hong Kong will not be immediately threatened by the British territory in the future." The Associated Press reporter also quoted a certain authority as saying, "We know from the last war that</p>
<p>Our limited defense on the mainland cannot militarily defend Hong Kong." The Associated Press's manuscript gave the Hong Kong newspapers the headline "Hong Kong is still a safe haven," which "shared the limelight" with the announcement of the big exercise on the same edition. Did the Hong Kong authorities' estimates go wrong? Or did the Associated Press reporter's estimates go wrong? It is not appropriate to draw conclusions hastily. But in any case, this "extraordinary" step in Hong Kong has been supported by the majority of residents.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changshu, 7th] The Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy has decided to establish a branch here in order to cultivate police talent and popularize the police station system. Director Huang has tentatively determined the location of the school to be in Zhitang Town. After the school sends personnel to Changshu for a second inspection, preparations for the establishment can be made.</p>
<p>[Also] The military and police joint inspection office of the city defense headquarters here was established on the 7th and is actively carrying out its mission. Also, the county authorities, in order to ensure local public security, have decided to jointly suppress potential bandits with neighboring counties, regardless of boundaries, and will launch suppressions at any time. The county's transportation and telecommunications network will be completed soon.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 4th] Business in the city is as usual. Projects such as widening streets and renovating facades in Western style on Zhongzheng Middle Road are still underway. City defense works are also being actively strengthened. Also, in order to prevent criminals from infiltrating, starting from the 3rd, all guest troops are not allowed to enter the city without the permission of the city defense headquarters. People in the countryside, except for those carrying rice straw, are temporarily not allowed to enter the city even if they have ID cards. Everything is in a state of readiness for war.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Sheep in the Northwest, Woolen Clothes Protect from Wind and Rain, Mutton Cools Thirst <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 6th] The Northwest is China's natural pastoral area, known by foreigners as one of the world's three major pastures, on par with the American West and Australia. Countless livestock are raised on this nearly 1.7 million square li pasture, especially sheep. In Qinghai, Xinjiang, and the Amdo Tibetan area, the number of sheep is so large that it cannot be counted, and they are counted in groups. According to surveys: Xinjiang has 9,828,378 sheep and 2,437,699 goats, totaling 12,266,077. (Statistics from the Northwest Geological Survey Institute) Gansu has 3,758,834 sheep and 1,219,019 goats, totaling 4,977,853. (Zhang Xin-yi: Estimates of Agricultural Conditions in Gansu Province) Although there are no recent statistics on sheep in Suiyuan and Ningxia provinces, according to old data, it is estimated that the seven banners of the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan alone have 1,330,000 sheep. It can also be imagined how many sheep they have. However, the</p>
<p>Total</p>
<p>How many sheep are there in China? There are still no accurate statistics to date. Over the years, government agencies, organizations, and private investigation reports have varied greatly, making them difficult to believe. According to rough estimates, there are approximately 45 million sheep, of which three-quarters are in the Northwest provinces and the remaining one-quarter are distributed in the mainland. If we look at the special books on Chinese wool, according to the common saying that "wool comes from the sheep," we can obtain the following statistics:</p>
<p>Production Area Production Volume Percentage</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia 144,000 dan 22.9</p>
<p>Ningxia, Suiyuan 47,200 dan 9.1</p>
<p>Chahar, Rehe 45,750 dan 7.5</p>
<p>Qinghai 71,500 dan 11.4</p>
<p>Gansu, Xinjiang 160,260 dan 25.4</p>
<p>Other Provinces 151,290 dan 24.0</p>
<p>Total 630,000 dan 100.0</p>
<p>From this, we can see how developed sheep farming is in the Northwest.</p>
<p>Due to the terrain, climate, and vast area of the Northwest, and the many grasslands, everywhere between the great mountains and seas, on the plateaus and plains, and in the green forests, there are natural and excellent</p>
<p>Pastures. Taking the Qilian Mountains of Gansu as an example, this kind of pasture with abundant water and grass stretches for three thousand li. On the boundless green grassland, mixed with the scattered wildflowers, there are moving white, black, or yellow things, which are herds of cattle, horses, and sheep. Near the small rivers, you can also see wisps of green smoke rising in the wind, which are the tents of the herders. Occasionally, a burst of high-pitched and heroic mountain songs floats from afar, which is a shepherdess expressing her youthful emotions.</p>
<p>We always think that nomadic peoples live by moving with the water and grass, but this situation is no longer very common. In places where there are many people engaged in animal husbandry, each family's pasture has a certain area, and they do not infringe on each other. In the summer, because the pasture is lush, this boundary can be more liberal. After shearing the wool in the summer, in order to protect their own pasture for winter use, each family leads their sheep to the public pasture on the mountain for a period of time. When the autumn wind blows the grass on the border yellow, they return to their own pasture to spend a long winter. At this time, each family carefully protects its own pasture and does not allow others to infringe on it. If someone crosses the boundary to graze, they will defend this source of life without fear of bloodshed.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Lu'an in Anhui Builds Fortified Villages, Checkpoints Set Up at Five City Gates <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lu'an, 5th] The city has a strong military force, and checkpoints are set up at all five city gates. All public and educational personnel wear symbolic badges, and the public must have ID cards, otherwise, they are not allowed to enter the city. Since the price limits were lifted, various goods have appeared one after another in the city, with a dazzling array and beautiful scenery, which has restored the normal state before "August 19th". The commercial market on Gulou North-South Street in the city is gradually becoming prosperous. Recently, the county government, following the order of the Pacification Zone, built security villages in order to consolidate city defense and public security, and each agency, group, and organization committee is specifically responsible for handling it. There is a New New Club at Dajingguai in the city. The opening time is from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day. After the play, a curfew is implemented. Officials of various agencies and groups are able to work on time without interruption, and their morale is quite good. There are county middle schools, Haifeng Girls' Middle School, Chongyi Private Middle School, Rongyang Private Middle School, County Zhongzheng Elementary School, Township Elementary School, and Bao Elementary School in the city. There is the County Jian Normal School and Provincial Lu'an Middle School and Provincial Lihuang Middle School outside the city. The school spirit is pure and the students have a strong atmosphere for studying. When there are grand gatherings, there are about 2,000 middle and elementary school students participating, and they are full of vigor. The countryside is still considered peaceful, but in areas such as Zhangjiadian, Maotanchang, Nanguanting, Xilianghekou, Dushan, and Shipodian, bandit troops appear from time to time, numbering only a few hundred or a thousand or so. When our army arrives to pursue and suppress them, the bandits flee far away at the sight of the wind. Rumors that Lu'an is tense are not true.</p>
<p>Recently, commodity prices in the city have been rising endlessly. Superior cooked rice costs 114 yuan per shi, which is slightly lower than before. Firewood is 14 yuan per dan, sesame oil is 5.5 yuan per catty, salt is 4 yuan per catty, and pork is 6 yuan per catty. Other daily necessities have risen to fourteen or fifteen times the price limit before "August 19th". Farmers, workers, and merchants are unaffected by the rising tide because wages are calculated in grain and bartered for real goods. However, ordinary salaried people are all crying out in pain, not only unable to support themselves, but even unable to get their fill all day long. It is heard that the County Council and the County Government are discussing ways to increase revenue in order to increase the salaries of public and educational personnel.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiaxing, 6th] The First District Commissioner invited the heads of the county's military, government, party, and counselors to a meeting on the 6th. In order to ensure the public security of the urban area, it was decided to establish a city defense headquarters, with Wang Lizhong, captain of the 11th Traffic Police Corps, concurrently serving as commander, and Chen Honglu, deputy commander of the commissioner's office, and Pan Zhenqiu, county magistrate, concurrently serving as deputy commanders. It was decided to convene a meeting of the heads of various agencies on a regular basis to determine the date of establishment and equipment, etc.</p>
<p>[Also] In order to strengthen contact, the chambers of commerce of various counties and towns in the Jia area held a meeting in He on the 6th. More than ten chairmen of the chambers of commerce of counties and towns attended the meeting and decided: (1) The National Tax Bureau often extracts account books from merchants, which often leads to misunderstandings. In the future, it should be handled jointly with the chamber of commerce. (2) A meeting should be held in He once a month. (3) The business tax should not be subject to other taxes and surcharges, and the tax rate should be adjusted according to the index, which is unbearable. Efforts should be made to argue with the authorities separately. (4) The tax bureau has exceeded the legal provisions for the income tax of temporary merchants. Notify various industries to collect information and submit it to relevant authorities for efforts to argue.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Miracle: Using Stones as Coal – Shale in Dihua: Inexhaustible <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dihua Correspondent, 5th] The Heavenly Mountains are covered in snow, the cold wind pierces the bone. In this season of coal shortage, the weather seems especially cold. The electric lights flicker on and off, the bathrooms are frigid, the daily newspaper is published late in the evening, factories are constantly shutting down, and schools, unable to bear the cold, are preparing to start winter vacation early. The provincial government has tried its best to alleviate the coal problem, but the quantity is naturally insufficient. Schools are dispersing boarding students, hoping to save the coal used in the dormitories to support the classrooms for a few more days. Their efforts are truly commendable.</p>
<p>According to the government, the severe coal shortage this winter is simply due to transportation difficulties. The coal production in Dihua not only suffices for the local area, but can also supply Changji, Gandeh, and other counties. The main reason for the panic is the transportation problem: although the Badaowan Coal Mine is only a few dozen kilometers from the city, large carts are unwilling to go there because the cost of fodder is too high, and automobiles are afraid to go there because the roads are rugged. As a result, the market supply and demand are imbalanced, and as the price of coal rises, everything else is affected, people are restless, and there is endless desolation!</p>
<p>Truly, "where the shade of flowers covers the ground, one suspects there is no road, but the stone path through the clouds reveals another world." A soldier from the Ninth Horse Transport Team in Old Manchu City, while burning firewood at the foot of Yaomo Mountain, suddenly discovered that the stones were burning. This "miracle" quickly spread to the ears of nearby residents. The residents at the foot of Yaomo Mountain are mostly poor people who have no money to buy coal. Hearing that there was this kind of stone that cost no money and could replace coal, why not go and enthusiastically dig some to bring back for warmth? So some carried small baskets, some carried headscarves, and some even drove large carts, marching in a grand procession to dig the cost-free coal stones.</p>
<p>These stones are oil shale, and they are being mined in the area near Yaomo Mountain with air-raid shelters. Oil shale is a layer of thin, black flakes, as if saturated with oil, and very easy to ignite. It burns long and hot, but it has a strange smell when burned, and it remains an undeformed stone even after burning.</p>
<p>After hearing about this "miracle," the Geological Survey sent seven or eight technicians early the next morning to mine several tens of kilograms of oil shale for combustion tests. The conclusion was that oil shale not only has stronger heat than coal, but also has a long-lasting flame, lasting for about an hour. Each time, only a small amount needs to be added. However, special care should be taken when burning, as the odor produced is not suitable for breathing.</p>
<p>Oil shale is an important industrial raw material for extracting kerosene and diesel. Geologists all know to use it for distilling oils. This summer, the Geological Survey discovered a large amount of oil shale in the suburbs of Dihua. After testing, the oil quality was not good, and they did not bother with it anymore. Now that people have inadvertently discovered a new use for it, giving it a chance to rise again, it is quite a meaningful thing.</p>
<p>In recent days, regardless of whether it is sunny, cloudy, windy, or snowy, people have been constantly going to mine and transport oil shale. Even the small donkeys that used to shuttle back and forth on the Badaowan road transporting coal have shifted their target and are now mining and transporting oil shale. According to the Geological Survey, the mountains near Dihua City are entirely composed of this oil shale, which is inexhaustible. This good news amidst the coal shortage not only reduces the threat of cold, but also provides a new scientific proof: oil shale can replace coal.</p>
<p>Severe winter has already arrived, and the winter relief effort of the Provincial Social Affairs Department has also begun. This year's relief target is 500 extremely poor people, with a budget of 120 billion provincial dollars, starting on the first of this month. (Our Correspondent, Ji Mu)</p>

<p>The price of rice increased by ten yuan in the local market, causing the local market to become slightly firm and sales to increase slightly. The market prices in the North and South markets varied, with arrivals still pouring in. The total volume in both markets was 11,570 shi and eight dou. The North Market's price increased by ten yuan because the local demand was smoother. The prices were: superior white japonica rice at 370 yuan, superior thin indica rice at 350 yuan, yangxian rice at 360 yuan, and baiyuan rice at 350 yuan. In the South Market, only yangxian rice increased by ten yuan to 380 yuan, and early rice increased by five yuan to 340 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged. The prices at the rice shops did not change, with superior white japonica rice still marked at 440 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market saw slightly looser credit among industry insiders, optimistic sentiment, and smoother demand, leading to a slight increase in prices. Battleship Flour was 125 yuan, closing at 128 yuan, up 5.5 yuan from the previous market. Lao Che Flour opened at 134 yuan and closed at 138 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour all turned firmer, rising by 3 to 5 yuan. Bran also showed strength, with Fuxin large bags at 77 yuan, up 2 yuan.</p>

<p>Maximum of 50 Yuan for Overseas Remittances Revised to 40 Yuan</p>
<p>Foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to rise sharply yesterday. At the opening in the morning, someone bought in at a high price of 40 yuan, but sellers held on to their certificates, creating a situation where there were too many monks and not enough porridge. The market price then rose rapidly, entering the 50-yuan range. The market atmosphere softened at the close, with transactions at 49 yuan. The quoted price for overseas remittances was also raised to 46 yuan yesterday, up 4 yuan from the previous high.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Money Market Trend Stable <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The money market trend remained stable. Although demand from various industries was strong, the supply was still abundant. The secret interest rate in the market was still between 20 and 30 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6 to 9 jiao, with most transactions around 7.5 jiao. However, the supply of cash remained depleted due to competition for gold and silver, which increased demand. Outflow of capital to the South has recently changed in nature. In the past, cash was transported, but now most of it is in the form of physical goods, especially gold and cotton cloth, in the largest quantities.</p>

<p>The yarn market retreated sharply yesterday. Credit in the market tightened, and the number of buyers suddenly decreased. Buyers from Guangdong were also less interested. Sentiment was weak, and many traders closed out their positions. Prices fell all the way down.</p>
<p>42s Blue Phoenix opened in the morning at 11,500 yuan, but few people were buying. It became strong near the close due to short covering, and finally closed at 12,000 yuan, down 1,500 yuan from the previous day. 40s Jincheng fell by 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>21s Double Horse initially opened at 10,400 yuan, but continued to be sold short, and the market could not withstand it and retreated. The market price fell into the 10,000 yuan range, dropping to a minimum of 9,400 yuan, and closed at 9,600 yuan, down 1,000 yuan. In addition, coarse yarns such as 20s and 16s also fell sharply.</p>
<p>Sales of cotton cloth were sluggish yesterday. Buyers from Guangdong and Hubei also reduced their purchases. Due to credit pressure, those in need of funds automatically sold off their holdings to reduce interest burden. Small holders also could not withstand it and rushed to sell. Cloth prices all loosened.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 413 yuan, and at one point reached a high of 420 yuan. Later, due to oversupply, the price declined again, closing at 390 yuan, down 26 yuan from the previous day.</p>

<p>The rayon silk industry has been stalled by fuel and funding problems, and many factories have suspended or reduced production. Demand has become stagnant, the market is quiet, and buying interest is scattered. Outside hoarders are selling off their holdings, and the market is oversupplied. Prices continue to weaken.</p>
<p>120s Tianqiao opened in the morning with a price call of 10,000 yuan. After the opening, there was more selling than buying, and new buyers could not afford it. Sentiment could not be boosted, and prices fell in a straight line. By the close, it was approaching the 9,000 yuan mark. Finally, after various parties closed out their positions and covered their shorts, the market stabilized slightly, and the price call rose by 300 yuan. Dongyang closed at 9,500 yuan, down 500 yuan from the previous noon close.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange transfer certificate for raw silk continued to rise sharply, making exports profitable. Foreign merchants increased their purchases, and price calls rose by another thousand yuan.</p>
<p>D-grade 78 evenness white factory silk opened in the morning at 12,500 yuan. After the opening, buying interest increased, sentiment improved, and price calls rose rapidly. The market closed at a high of 13,500 yuan, and premium retail was 13,000 yuan, both up a thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was slightly soft yesterday. Factory silk prices rose sharply, and sentiment was optimistic. However, due to weak demand, there were more sellers than buyers in the market, and the market was unable to rally. Yesterday, credit tightened, and the secret interest rate rose by ten yuan. The general short-term lending rate in the market was between 30 and 40 yuan per thousand yuan. Short-term holders again unloaded their holdings for cash, and the market remained weak. Meiya Bedding opened in the morning at 8,100 yuan. After the opening, hearing that the yarn and cloth markets outside the industry were weak, sentiment turned fearful, and price calls decreased. At one point, it was as low as 7,660 yuan.</p>
<p>Huaqiang initially traded at 8,000 yuan. The market happened to be soft, and short positions were closed out. There was relentless selling in the market. Near noon, it was as low as 7,500 yuan. After hitting this low, short positions were covered, and sentiment turned from soft to stable. The market recovered slightly. Meiya closed at 7,800 yuan, and Huaqiang closed at 7,700 yuan. The remaining items all closed lower.</p>
