<h3>九龍城難胞無地容身　港政府再强制迫遷　穗各界明開會商詩封策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕首都方面對沙面事件，十八日無甚發展，英大使館亦未就此事件，向我方提任何抗議，正候英倫政府之訓令。據悉：關於九龍城問題，四日來倫敦方面雙方代表仍不斷接觸，且時有報告到京。至沙面事件，兩方均持沉默，外部對事件全部經過　已明瞭，然尚未獲詳細敎字及被捕之逞兇者之審訊情形之報告。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕敎部鑒於廣州學生及民衆遊行引起不幸事件，十七日特通電各省市敎育應局，全國專科以上學校，闡述九龍城事件交涉經過，盼各應局局校長切實勸導學生，力持鎭靜，候政府合理解決，斷不得有逾軌行動，致爲奸徒利用，而增外交困難。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕困居九龍城難胞，港方頃再度迫令限十九日全部遷出。此間之反應突又因此而再達高潮。各界組織之九龍城事件後援會，十八日舉行第三次會議，已決定等候十九日關於九龍城情况之報告後，廿日舉行全體大會，採取對策。據此間機器工會及海員工會負責人表示不，若九龍城事態一告惡化，將目先實行大規模之罷工運動。海員工會且宣布於半小時內可全體立即停止一切工作，所有省港輪渡均將因此而告停航，貨物亦將無從下卸，並預料港方海員亦將採取同一行動。又今日雖爲星期日，省市各首長仍均終日辦公，處理沙面事件，被捕嫌犯達一四〇餘名，已開始審訊。沙面已解嚴，但仍有軍警嚴密看守。衆信事能或將又因港方對九龍城居民之迫遷而再度惡化。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港十八日電〕中國國旗今日繼續　　於九龍舊城區，被拆尾之居民已建立許多小型帳幕，以資容身，並建立兩軍用區帳幕，作爲被等之總部，並存儲糧食。警察未會亦不擬加以干涉。又珠江內今僅有中國客輪一艘，貨輸兩艘通航。太古船於廣州事件後即停航，惟香港航空公司之廣州班機仍照開。</p>
<p>〔本報東慶十八日電〕渝警局今通知各領事館，學生若爲抗議九龍城事件遊行，嚴禁外人外出，免生意外。</p>
<h3>漢學生護權遊行　呼籲內求安定外抗强權</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十八日電〕此間中華大學，國立體專，省立農院及各中學代表二百餘人，爲抗議九龍城事件，十八日晨十時以卡軍三輛遊行，先在武昌市區作廣播宣傳，並高呼「內求安定，外抗强權」等口號。午後一時半過江，復以卡車五輛在漢市中心區遊行，秋序良好。軍警當局並曾派員保護英商公司及英領事館。三時半各代表謁程主任請願，四時招待記者，申述電請政府收回港儿理由。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢口十八日電〕此間學生三百餘人在今日下午舉行反英示威遊行，然未能抵達彼等之目的地——英國領事館。領事館周　整日有便衣隊把守，當學生大隊在下午二時自武昌抵達長江　口時，即被警察驅轉。</p>
<p>英美領事館人員均在屋頂觀看，後由警察勸其進內，以免引起　衆之憤怒。</p>
<p>英領事斯道克萊整日在領事館內未離去，然領事館屋頂未縣英國旗。市上空氣尚平靜，蓋警察局昨日得悉學生有在今日遊行之計劃後立即採取必要措置，預防廣州慘劇之重演也。</p>
<p>〔本報鄭州十八日電〕本市江蘇學院及中學聯合會今決議電請政府，對英强硬抗哉，並收回香港九龍。</p>
<h3>穗學聯會理事　對沙面案談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十八日電〕市學生聯會常務理事兼秘書渠長城，十八日對焚毀英領事館事，發表意見稱：「木會領導各校同學，參加本市各界示威大遊行，純係出於愛國熱情，不料是日發生焚　英領事館事件，甚感遺憾。事後社曾人士間有誤會爲學生所爲，此始爲不明傎相所致。查是日參加遊行學生，抵達沙面高呼口號後，即宣布散隊，各校同學亦紛紛離閒。焚毀一事，實係當羣情激憤時，陰謀份子乘機縱火。當時本曾常務理事李迺紈及本人等，多在塲勸散各同學，幷維持秩序，且保護英僑威廉士夫歸等　開領事館。被捕同學，多係在場維持秩序，而誤會被捕者，連日查訊釋放者，已有多人。對仍未提訊者，本人決於十九日分到各治安機關請求保釋。對九龍事件，今後仍本以往態度，誓爲政府後盾，務求此事合理解決」云</p>
<h3>英報刊沙面事件　僅事實未置評</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十七日電〕今日倫敦各報均載廣州騷動之報道，惟未加評論。各報道陳述事件經過之態度甚客觀，並特別諭及糾紛之起源。泰半報紙提及由國政府爲制止騷動所作之努力，及行政院長張羣下令廣東省政府官員採取防止繼續發生反英遊行之措施。泰晤士報並詳細報道我駐倫敦各官員對此事件之觀點。渠等對事件之發生，表示遺憾。並謂中國政府曾屢促港府，以圓通之手腕及自制力，處理九龍城華人居留事。蓋唯恐英國之任何强硬舉動，可能被若干極端份子利用，作爲煽動反英及反政府騷動之藉口。英外務部昨晚曾邀我駐英大使鄭天錫洽談，鄭氏亦表示相同之觀點。</p>
<h3>鎮準備選舉立委　立委投票簿解送問題　贛選所請准變通辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報錢江十八日電〕鎭江立委選舉決於廿一，二，三日在各鄕鎭同時舉行。鎭縣記者公會會員一六三人，指定在雙井鎭投票。據一般領測，參加鎭縣區立委競選者，以陳光甫爲最有希望。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕關於立委投票簿解送問題，江西省選所曾報此間總選所謂，已採一權宜處理辦法，並請求准予備案。據稱，投票簿事實上係以選民册代替，而存縣市之立委選民册，原係以國代選民册爲存底，倘因代替投票簿後，即須解送區選所，則縣市連國代選民册亦無存底，如由區選所將選民册寄發各縣市代替投票簿，非特郵寄往返困難，時間上亦有不及。茲特規定立委選舉投票簿，准以原存縣市之選民册代替，仍由縣市保存，惟投票完畢後，須由縣市依照規定將投票簿上應行記載事項另行列表報送區選所核備，以資補救，理合報請鑒核備案。總選舉事務所昨十八次選舉委會決議，准予備案。</p>
<h3>簽當選國代　堅決反對配選</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國民黨籍國代簽署提名當選人聯誼會，十八日晨九時開會，續討論黨員退讓問題，當通過各要案如次：　爲維護憲法，澈底反對不民主之配選惡例，不達以得票最多者爲當選，誓不龍休，　在三月十九日前各地代表全體集京，　加强選民護憲運動，　如選舉權及被選舉權被剝奪，則人民可不盡應盡之義務，　推派代表請選總依法將當選證書面接交與當選人，　發表第三次宣言，　會員張秀柏在崇明被選所非法取銷當選資格，除由本人依法控訴外，並由會向選總及省選所抗議。</p>
<h3>首屆國代選舉　職圑選民統計　總數達四百七十餘萬</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕據全國性職婦選舉統計，上年十一月間我國舉行之第一屆國民大會代表選舉，參加投票之職業團體選民，共爲四百七十一萬九千四百四十人，內計漁業四一一·一七〇，鐵路工會〇五·〇七五，海員工會一三八·六五〇，鹽業工會二四七·二五〇，礦業工會二一五·五九四，公路工會四一二·八六三，電信工會一二·五九五，商業團體二·〇九七·九九〇，工礦團體一八二·〇三三，敎育會九九〇·〇七一，敎育團體一五·三〇三，新聞記者公會二八·三一六，律師公會五。九四一，農業技師一·〇〇四，土木技師五·一一三，機械技師三〇六，電機技師二五七，化學技師二〇四，紡織技師五五，礦業技師五八七，會計師公會一·〇五五，中醫師公會九一·一二四，醫師公會二一一·四二二，助產士及護士公會一·九七二，　　師（生）會一·九一九。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕國府息：銀樓業收兌及製造金飾管理辦法第四條條文，經財部轉呈國府核准，予以修正備案，並分令各直轄機關飭遵，茲錄該修正條文於後：</p>
<p>銀樓業收兌及製造金飾管理辦法修正條文第四條，銀樓業兌出金飾價格，准依照中央銀行抖牌金價另加營業費百分之四十及合法利潤百分之二十，其另加工資部份，並得視兌出金飾工作之精粗，由當地同業公會議定，報經當地主管官署核定之。收進金飾，准視加工之精粗，比照地方官署核定售出金飾應加工資數目，於牌價之外，加給工資兌入。</p>
<h3>中港緝私協定　延至二月一日實施</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕據悉：中港緝私協定，原定廿日實施，頃因一切準備尚未就緒，可能延期下月一日施行，我海關將派遣大批關員赴港，協助檢查自港入國之一切船隻，又丁貴堂已自台赴港，主持執行協定事宜。</p>

<h3>我使用美貸計劃　張嘉璈在京正搜集資料　分改革幣制與經濟建設兩部門</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕美援華新法案即將提出，我國使用美貸計劃，除已由我國派赴美之技術代表團貝祖詒等携往一部外，因貝等臨行匆匆，尚有甚多資料未及搜集，現正由張嘉激負責搜集中，張氏自滬抵京已三日，連日與有關機關接觸頻繁，正忙於搜集資料，與張氏同來負協助之責者，尚有央行高級職員數人。張氏負責搜集之資料，可分兩大部門，一爲關於改革幣制資料，一爲有關經濟建設資料，而後者更包括交通，水利，農林，工鑛等各種部門，範圍甚廣。貝氏抵美後，並已有電致張氏，謂所携資料不够充分，請繼續搜集送往美國，張氏在京擬再留二日，廿日返滬。</p>

<p>〔本报南京十八日電〕關於貨款開放與否問題，四聯總處前曾徵求各行局間見，現已收到中國銀行，中農行，郵匯局及合作金庫之每答復，咸主開放貨款，並提出本年度之貨款計劃，惟主張貨款開入後，貨款範　圍應予縮小，並嚴格限制。另悉：關於本年度新貨計劃，四聯總處亦在研商中，此項新計劃並非另擬新辦法，而僅係將現行之「投資貼放方針」及「修正貼放原則」加以修正。過去貨款之範圍較廣，今後將予緊縮，將僅以六項日用必需品及交通公用事業出口等九項為限，貨款利率亦將車加研討。四聯貨款之目的，在維持生產低利，固有其優點，但低利易形成囤積之弊。關於貨款採訂貨方式，亦在研究中，惟蔣主席過去曾手諭在農　元宵節前不得開放貨款，故在元宵節前仍無開放之望。</p>
<h3>衛立煌即飛瀋履新　主席昨午召宴指示機宜　東北匪軍集結又圖蠢動</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕蔣主席十八日下午一時在官邸召宴衛立煌夫婦，晚九時許，衛氏再謁主席，請示有關東北剿匪機宜。衛氏現正積極準備赴溙履新，蔣主席命其於十九日飛瀋，但衛氏以事實上在京尚有要公待理，並須搜集東北匪情資料，故最是在廿一日始可起程。十八日下午，劉士毅曾訪衛氏，九時半，張治中亦訪衛長談。又，東北剿匪副總司令及參謀長人選，將俟衛抵瀋後發表，陳誠雖已決定返京休　，但返京期尚未定。</p>

<h3>社論　人民要活得下去，國家要强得起來！　——戡亂建國總動員的意義</h3>
<p>昨天上海市各界舉行戡亂建國動員大會，蘇北皖北山東各匪區難胞代表先後陳訴了他們所受辛酸殘酷的遭遇，到會三四千聽衆深深地被感動了。潘議長說：「我們戰後，國際地位的降低，休養生息機會的喪失，都是共匪的罪惡」。吳市長說：「共匪不除，中國必亡：共匪一除，中國必强」。國民黨方主委說：「不剿共匪，不能建國」。靑年黨代表蕭炳星民則說：「剿匪戡亂，方可恢復農村，增加生產，人人有飯吃，個個有衣穿」。他們這樣一致的大聲疾呼，究竟爲了什麼？</p>
<p>說得簡單些，就是兩句話：爲了人民要活得下去，也爲了國家要强得起來！</p>
<p>就爲了這兩點，我們不能不以全力戡亂，不能不以全力建國。</p>
<p>本來，我們在抗日戰爭中，煎熬了八年長　的艱苦，流血流汗，出錢出力，在英明領袖領導之下，與盟邦駢肩作戰，終於打了勝仗，使暴寇屈膝。我們人民應該可以透口氣，好好的活下去了。我們國家更已經廢除了對外的不平等條約，躋於世界四强或五强之列，再加努力奮發，自然應該强得起來了。然而，今天怎麼樣？</p>
<p>物價一天一天的高，生活一天一天的難，不惟戰前的情景，如今祗能視爲美夢，就連勝利之初的苦况，現在也幾乎可望而不可卽了。我們都威覺得生活負担的重壓，都看得出失業羣衆的增加，都漸漸要喊出活不下去的救命聲了！但是，我們得仔細想一想，這是受誰之賜？假使沒有出賣國家民族利益的共匪，與兵作亂，我們一定能够和平建設，增加生產，擴大勝利的果實，提高生活的水準，何至於反而日益艱困，年不如年，有活　要活不下去之感？試閉目思之；兩年來共匪破壞的　路達若干里？破壞的礦廠有若干處？荒廢的農田有若干畝？屠殺毀滅的人力有若干？焚燒擄掠的財物有若干？……一切的一切，我們人民生活的源泉，都將因殘暴共匪的長期破壞而枯竭，人民又安得而不窮，更安得而不發「活不下去」之歎？上海的同胞們，後方非綏請區的同胞們，大家應該認淸兩點；　我們人民今天所以有活不下去之感者，一切都是共匪流寇叛亂在作祟。　我們今天假使還不警覺，還不趕快起來，忍痛一時，貢獻一切人力物力，擁護政府早日戡平匪亂，那麼日後恐將要求如今日之生活而不可得，說不定也要遭受到像今天匪區裏同胞一樣的命運！</p>
<p>今天我們從匪區難胞的口中，可以聽到啼飢號寒的慘痛呼聲：從匪區難胞的臉上，可以看出兇殺酷刑的殘暴輪廓。他們有田不能耕，有工不能作，有書不能讀，有財產不能保，有廬舍不能守，甚至有生命亦不能活。他們被鬥爭，被淸算，被陷害，被虐殺。他們在嚴刑峻罰之下，甚至被迫看子弒其父，兄殺其弟，夫妻作仇警，朋友爲敵寇，滅絕人性，破壞倫常的行爲早　司空見慣。共匪雖以士地改革或階級鬥爭相號召，欲藉此以欺騙農民，欺騙勞工，而實則共匪最後的目的祇是在用殺人放火的暴力奪取一切生產工具，故必殺盡一切生產工具所有者以爲快。因此，往往因淸算地主而分得土地的農民，一轉瞬間又不免於被淸算，往日因與店主鬥爭而奪得店舖的夥計，一轉瞬間又不免於被鬥爭·充其淸算鬥爭之所極，勢非迫令人民全都死亡不止。反對共匪的八，在匪區內固不能活，自以爲不問政治，與匪無爭的人們也何嘗能活？甚而至於盲從共匪，受其裹脅的無知羣衆，或附和共匪爲其鼓吹的知識份子，到末了又何嘗能活？大家時時刻刻提心吊膽，不知那一天送掉性命·連呼吸幾乎都失去了自由，還有什麼「活」的意義？今天本報所載太原電，閻錫山說共匪最近正在　嚴厲淸黨，　迫令幹部「參軍」（卽當兵），解散學校，强制學生參軍，　减少食糧配給，驅使農民上戰塲，這些都足以證明匪區裹的同胞全在被迫害和被犧牲的可憐狀態下，他們終有一天雖欲苟延殘喘而不可得，眞有活不下去之苦了！我們要救自己，救難胞，要使人民大家活得下去，今天沒有別的辦法，祇有一心一德，出錢出力，動員我們的一切，去勦匪，去戡亂。</p>
<p>再說，抗戰期間，我國在開羅會議時的地位，在聯合國初成立時的地位，獨立自主的尊嚴，揚眉吐氣的風光，堂堂大國，誰不感到榮譽？假以數年，和平建設，國富民强，那個國家還再敢來侮辱？無如共匪媚外性成，賣國爲務，騷擾破壞，不遺餘力，由是而降低了我們的國際地位。戰敗的日本逐漸抬頭，罪魁禍首的東條還居然曉曉爲其罪行自辯。盟邦蘇聯更超越其片面挾持的中蘇條約的範圍，霸佔旅大，割裂東北，支持共匪叛亂以爲快意。而昔日我們與之曾共患難，在印緬境內駢肩作戰的英國，今且有香港政府任令警察演出勒拆九龍城內民居，槍傷中國人民的暴行，恬然不以爲怪。我們試想，未及兩年，我們國家的國際地位爲什麼低落到如此！共匪一日不除，大亂一日不北，亦卽國家一日不能走上富强之路，中國國民一日不能抬頭見人。</p>
<p>中國人民確是愛好和平的人民，中國這個國家也決不是侵略成性的國家；然而在這局勢動盪的世界上，中國今後如果還想立足，究非在三年五年內奠定富强的基礎不可。二次世界大戰以後，中國假設錯過了圖强的大好機會，那豈但像九龍城內居民受辱的事件，旅順大連被鄰國恃强霸佔的事件，行將層出不窮，或且有更大於此的事變可能發生：甚至如九一八，如七七，這種外來暴力的全面侵略，誰也不知道在那一天可以加到我們頭上來的。我們眞應趕快警覺啊！不自强，祇有滅亡！然而，共匪不除，騷　無已，中國又怎麼會强？所以，我們要使國家强得起來，必須更熬着一切艱苦，用盡一切力量，早日勦滅共匪。</p>
<p>上海這個都市，儘有愛國愛民的人士，他們自然熱心於救難胞，救祖國，希望人民能够活，國家能够强。但，同時上海也儘多沒有靈魂的人們，火已燒到眉毛，還在紙醉金迷，偸生夢死！我們須得呼喚這些無靈魂的人們，大家醒醒罷！我們要使人民活，要使國家强，就迅速的一致動員，戡亂建國！</p>

<h3>閻錫山談四個徵象　證明共匪將作殘酷盲動</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原十八日電〕「現在有四個徵象，證明共匪認爲戰亂時間拖長，對他不利，今年就要破釜沉舟，孤注一擲，作殘酷的盲動。」此爲太原綏署閻主任錫山頃分析共匪叛亂局面時所作之結論。閻氏稱：共匪已日暮途窮，正作迴光返照的最後掙扎，有四個徵象可以說明此現象：　嚴厲淸黨，凡以農人出身的幹部軍官士兵，均遭淸算，以免進行最後決戰時發生動搖；　迫令幹部參軍，行政工作大部停止，不是準備決戰，他不肯如此，也無此必要；　解散學校，把誘騙來的靑年學生，都强制參軍，和改編土地，改革算賬鬥爭工作團；　减少食糧配給量，不做長久的增產打算，而驅使農民上戰塲。閻氏繼復指出共匪的殘忍，不是共產然員的「人性」問題，而是在共產主義的錯誤觀點下，殘忍殺人是需要的，而且是永久的，因爲共產主義的原則是以暴力奪取生直手段，不以和平轉變改造舊制度，勢非殺盡生產手段所有者不可。又因共產主義是以權力收集一切生產品，產品由他分配，勢必誅除不願做他的牛馬的勞働者，所以淸算過地主分得土地的農民，曾幾何時，就又被淸算，這樣，共匪的殺人如割草，是永遠不會結束的，所以我們要認淸共匪面目，動員一切力量，戡平匪亂。</p>
<h3>滬漢等六地將設　過境部隊招待所</h3>

<h3>甘地終止絕食　印度各教領袖成立協定　保證履行七和平條件</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新德里十八日電〕印度精神領袖甘地已於今日下午十二時四十五分（上海時間下午三時十五分）停止絕食，同時印度敎，錫克族，及回敎各領袖簽訂協定，保證履行甘地所提出之和平計劃，維持少數民族之安全。</p>
<p>甘地端坐塌上，　飮甜檸檸汁一小玻璃杯，距開始絕食共計一百廿一小時又四十五分，對其　請各敎徒息爭修好之誓約似已滿意。國大黨主席普拉薩特則向畢拉大廈人頭擁擠之一室宣佈此事，甘地笑而無言·民宣稱，「甘然現已停止絕食，信託吾人·責任全在吾人身上，吾人必須遵守其信託而行」。甘地開始進食之訊，俟由其姪孫並娃首先傳出。伊奔下通這用印度語向等候之記者發表該項消息時，甚至喜極欲涕。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾計劃　爲搞蘇武器　杜勒斯在紐發表演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十七日電〕共和黨外交政策發言人杜勒斯稱：美國須用糧食及創造性之觀念以打擊蘇聯之在全世界「宣傳及怠工」武器。社勒斯係出席聯合國大會代表，並在最近之四强會議中歷充爲歇爾之　問。十七日在紐約外交政策協曾午宴中稱：馬歇爾計劃爲美國反侵賂最有力之武器。據稱：在戰爭結束時，蘇聯領袖即認爲吾人爲敵人而非友人，蘇聯出此一策，據稱係因莫斯科爲「蘇聯共產黨最高權威」。將在全世界進行意識鬥爭。又稱：蘇聯爭霸世界之武器爲「官傳技術」及罷工意工等。美國必須以糧食·燃料及創造性之觀念與理想休戰。獲致和平之第一階段榮己在最近外長會議破裂中結束；第二階段已表現東西兩方之鬥學白熱化，美國打撀共產黨怠工之計劃如告失敗，則爲數　損失。</p>

<h3>援歐並非獲取基地　馬歇爾發表聲明　用意祗在重建歐洲經濟</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕自國防部長福萊斯特於週四在參院外委會中述及歐洲復興計劃與獲取海外基地間可能的聯繫後，國務部接獲情報，悉編氏之言已引起歐洲極度的興趣與關切，因此馬歇爾國務卿特於今日發表聲明，內稱：現由國會審查中的歐洲復興計劃，旣不規定亦未計及獲取軍事基地，以與美國對歐經濟援助交換之事。</p>
<p>美國援助的用意，紙在使參加復興計劃的國家得以實建其健全有力的經濟，此項目的，與國防部長福萊斯泰向參院外委會發表之意見並不衝突。福氏於答覆關於海外基地重要性的問題時，曾表示渠對此一觀念並不爭辯，渠確信國務鄉亦未嘗忘却此點，但渠相信就優先次序言，渠當首先顧及受援國家國民信念的恢復。外界對於福氏之言，顯然已有曲解。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫　招待各國使節</h3>

<h3>華萊士演說　主張成立第三黨　並抨撀杜魯門與援歐計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社芝加哥十七日電〕美總統選舉獨立候選人華萊士，今日在此向美國進步公民會第二屆年會發表演說，正式主張成立第三黨「爲和平安全及繁榮而舊門」。渠指「杜魯門主義」及「妄用歐洲復興方案之名的馬歇爾訂劃」，乃「大企業爲本身利益而控制的戰學政策」，並曰，「民主共和兩黨的通貨膨脹及超度利潤計劃，將引起經濟恐慌及戰爭的爆發」。華氏並建議：　即時提高工資，規定每小時一元之最低限度工資，保存並推廣每過工作四十小時的合法制度；　實施有效管制，以壓低物價，剝奪因通貨膨脹，而獲得的暴利，並拒絕塔虎脫及杜魯門的兩黨「少吃」政策；　廢止塔虎脫，哈特萊的限制工會活動法案；　放棄奔向戰爭的政策。華氏又云：「民主黨政府茍未放棄羅斯福計劃，則余之支持者，當不致被迫建立新黨，在　一月之大選中，千百萬的選民，將選舉拒絕同意引起世界另一戰爭，使美國經濟陷入空前不景氣的政策之人，目前脫韁的物價漲勢，皆政府大企業的欺詐，以及華爾街之獲取暴利所引起。民主共和兩黨雖視通貨膨脹爲罪惡，但未採取傎正步驟與其搏戰，杜魯門總統於此僅有無效的姿態，而他所提創的戰爭政策，將不能避免的引起更高的物價與更鉅的暴利。」</p>
<h3>巴爾幹委會指責　阿支持希游撃隊　向賴依提二次報告書</h3>
<p>〔路透社　典十七日電〕聯合國巴爾幹委會頃向聯合　藝書長賴依提出第二次臨時報告特別注意最近雅尼那·柯尼柴區之事件，所獲結論乃爲阿爾巴尼亞於希臘遊撃隊進攻柯尼柴時，曾給予各種戰略及物質的援助，並協助彼等組織供應事宜。該報告書係以於十二月廿九日至一月二日被派赴前綫調查之該委會小組所獲結論爲根據。報告書並認阿爾巴尼亞之援助希遊擊隊，與去年十月廿一日聯大決議之精神相悖。復曰保總理於十二月卅一日發表之演說，亦可霧保加利亞之未能遵守聯大建議，以與希臘樹立善鄰關係。</p>

<h3>戡建動員大會席上　難民痛陳共匪暴行　議長籲請市民集中國量共赴時艱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市參議會潘議長，昨在上海市各界戡亂建國動員大會上，就共匪作亂，危害中國之命運，向各界三千餘人發表演說，提出沉痛語稱：「民族生存，國家生計，人民生活，均遭受共匪嚴重威脅，有了共匪的破壞，就沒有中華民國的存在。」</p>
<p>此空前之戡亂建國動員大會，於昨日上午九時在天蟾舞合熟烈舉行。出席本市各界千餘餘單位代表三千餘人，蘇北，安徽，山東各匪區流亡難胞，亦派代表參加。會塲座無隙地，情諸激昂異常。大會由潘公展任總主席，吳市長，方治，徐　廣，王曉籟，吳蘊初，鄭毓秀，蕭炳星，陶百川，謝仁釗，陳保泰任主席團。會塲內外，由童子軍及軍警分別維特秋序·大會開始，潘總主席首致開會詞，闡明動員大會之意義及目標。繼稱：「勝利兩年來，出國以無限犧牲爭得之國際地位，已爲共能叛亂而摧毀無遺。中國人民經八年之戰爭離亂，咸有休養安息之需要，建設生產之需要。但吾人並未獲得如吾人希望之安居樂業，四萬五千萬人迄今仍在艱苦生活中。吾人深切檢討，破壞國家人民辛福利益者，亦使爲共匪之叛亂。蘇，魯，豫，鄂，皖，湘及東北各省人民，原能於勝利後安居樂菜，今己大批流亡異鄉，或塡於溝　。彼等均爲共匪叛亂中最直接之受難者。吾人除在人類同情方面作消極之救濟援助外，並須追溯此項人爲災禍之根本原因，積極參加剿匪戡亂工作，使殘酷暴行永不於歷史中再見。若千人認爲「戡亂建國」之工作僅屬於國民然，此宜爲一大錯覺。中國人民所祇望者爲「三民主義共和國」，使傎正之民主統一實現，全國人民必須共同負起戡亂之責任。吾人令日舉行此一動員大會，即希望全市人民即日起集中力量，共赴時艱，予共匪叛亂以致命打擊，期必澈底消滅而後己」。</p>
<p>匪區流亡來　學生代表　漢　勛報告匪區情形（本報攝）</p>
<h3>吳市長警語　共匪不除　中國必亡</h3>
<p>吳市長繼致詞稱；抗戰八年後，吾人雖已獲得量後勝利，人民生活仍不能安居樂業，中國國際地位亦重趨低落。此次九龍事件，如非國際地位低落，絕對不會發生。檢討其原因，實緣於共匪之武裝叛亂，破壞統一。政府有維持國家安定之責任，乃不得不痛下戡亂決心。是以富初如共匪交出武力，全國統一，則今日收回港九，，當無問題。吳氏結語稱：共匪不除，中國必亡，共匪一除，中國必强，希望市民認淸目標，齊爲戡亂建國而努力。嗣由方主委致詞，强調如　建國，必先動員戡亂，戡亂不完成，建國無從着手。方氏繼指出共匪所作所爲，不僅毀滅中國，且將危反世界和平。並就匪區共匪殘舉悄形，叙述頗詳。再次由靑年黨上海市黨部代表蕭炳星致詞，闡述兩點：　我國向爲愛好和平安居樂業之民族，國人應努力爭取。　應「大家有飯吃一，而非「有飯大家吃」。</p>
<h3>搜捕靑年　驅往前綫</h3>
<p>嗣由匪區流亡學生代表楊漢勛，蘇北難民代表沙壬，山東難民代表崔德潤，安徽難民代表恃國聰等先後報告，渠等身歷目擊之種種匪區暴行。楊漢勛述及共匪所作所爲時，指爲「不是人幹得出的，簡直是禽獸的行爲」。渠稱「共匪佔據一地，即搜捕無知鄉民及靑年，驅往前綫，使民抑其後，最末始爲督戰之主力部隊。無辜犧牲之良民難以數計，國軍爲不忍殺害老百姓，亦有貽誤戎機之情形。經濟方面搜刮尤無所不用其極，田賦須征納所獲百分之六十以上，並强迫人民使用無限止發行之僞鈔，從事搜括物資。</p>
<p>四種酷刑</p>
<p>至匪區常使用之酷刑，有下列數種：　大湯－將報害人赤裸，手足緊綁，擲入河內。　活埋－將被害人全身埋入泥土，僅露一首，待面月　大後，以鐵錘猛擊，血腦飛繼而死。　爬行　將被害人手足趾內釘入鐵釘，使匍匋爬行。　空縣－將被害人手足反綁，縣空吊起，歷數日而死。</p>
<p>誤人共黨　被逼殺父</p>
<p>蘇北代表沙壬以沉痛語氣自述渠爲一小商人，　爲共匪「民主」口號所迷惑，曾參加匪方幹部工作，但在數次「門爭」中，終於奉命往殺其小資產階級之老父，渠返鄉後見老父紙能相對　淚，不忍下手，遂連夜易服流亡離鄉。但其父結果仍被殺害。沙壬幷稱，「共匪在盤踞區內不但殺害資產者幷殺害知識份子，如共匪至滬，今日在座諸君，亦均在被殺之列共匪開會時，不縣歷旗及國父遺像，但懸鐮刀斧頭之旗　及列寗馬克思像其賣國險謀已灼然可見。本人今日爲共黨叛徒，但深信積極參加之戡亂工作，實爲追求傎理興正義之表現」。山東代表崔德潤爲一典型之北方農民，渠以會受小學敎育之一罪名」，與其兄同時被捕。　於拘禁八月獲釋後，其兄終被槍決</p>
<p>一語召禍　慘死非命</p>
<p>安徽代表侍國聽則述一小學時代同學之慘死故事，被害人之「罪名」，僅於無意中漏出「共產黨對國家也沒有甚麼辦法」一語，爲「共特」所聞，即使八綁之曳地而行，謂之「坐飛機」，終於血肉模糊而死。報告畢，並當塲通過「向蔣主席致敬電」及「慰勞能方剿匪將士電」後，全體高呼「集中力量戡亂建國」，「剿滅破壞和平的共匪」，「要求政府嚴厲交涉收同港，九，旅，大」等口號。十一時半禮成，旋即舉行遊藝節目，迄中午而散。市黨部宣傳大隊，即於會後出動列軍數輛，分赴各區作化裝宣傳，迄晚始止。</p>
<p>美贈無綫電器材　協助我業餘沽動　朱其渣返國談話</p>
<p>中國業餘無綫電協會總緝輯朱其清氏·上年七月間奉派赴熒代表我國業餘家，出席國際電訊會議，並與彼邦業餘无綫電家就一般問題，交換意見，業已公　返國抵滬。朱氏在美期問，深獲全美各地數萬業）餘家之歡迎，能者昨走訪朱氏，詢以此行觀感及收獲。據稱：「美國業餘無綫電活動　爲　遠，爲全球之冠，現有電台于餘萬座，每一千五百人，即有一電台，美邦人士此次對我抗　期間，利用少量器材稱　設備，努力業餘活動，協助軍訊，表示欽佩，僉以我國戰後無棧電業餘活動，關係電訊敎育及建設甚巨，極　加以協助，當經各學術團體商行如美國業餘無綫電協會，通用無綫電公司及奇異公司等商行，概損大量傎空管收發訊機及重要配件等數十餘箱，價格在數萬美元以上，最近正陸續分批起運來華」。</p>
<p>山東匪區被難農民崔　潤報　告共匪暴行（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>各業加入同業公會　社會局訂三項辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關配給物品之各業同業公會會員入會問題，社會局前迭據未入會各業代表聲訴，公會拒絕彼等入會，形成把持壟斷，妨害同業利益。而據各業公會表示，同業由常有虛設字號投機取巧，要求加入公會套取配給。</p>
<p>社會局以各業同業加入公會依法原爲强制性質，自不許公會任意拒絕。惟爲防止奸商投機漁利，亦不應任其籍端取巧，致妨害正當同業之發展。爲兼籌並顧起見，特訂定辦法三項，訓令各業同業公會遵照：　有配給物品之各公司·工廠·商號已領有經濟部公司執照工廠登記證或社會局商業登記證者，一律准其入會。　如有虛設字號或隱匿配售物品有連反防止商民投機取巧處理準則之情形，由公會檢舉呈報社會局，吊銷其商業登記證或呈請經濟部吊銷其執照或工廠登記證。　新會員（入會後之配售權利，各公會得斟酌情形，由理監事聯席會議擬訂辦法呈局核准後施行。嗣後遇有同樣情形，應即依照上項辦法處理，以期公允而符法令。</p>
<h3>開封美敎士抵滬談　共匪區域人民　受盡强暴壓迫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕共匪在老河口附近槍殺三外籍敎士後，美敎會命敎會人員撤退南下，浸禮會開封敎會負責人海立斯亦於日前撤退抵滬。海氏來華傳敎巳達卅七年，因年事已長，將離華返國。記者昨特往訪海氏，承其發表對共匪觀感。據海氏多年之觀察及經歷，認爲任何有理智與抱有傎正民主觀念者是不能和共匪妥協的。許許多多從匪區逃出來的人民與敎友對共匪的印象，是：他們的作風比日本軍人更强縣，他們破壞的程度比日寇又更殘酷。海氏親眼目睹共匪破壞鐵路焚毀鄉村的情形，使他知道共匪的目的是欲搗亂國家經濟，使每個老百姓不能安居樂業，甚至速過活都不能，想盡方法以完成他們的陰謀。</p>
<p>權益自由　極大損失</p>
<p>記渚復詢以外傳共匪的行政效率較一般爲高，是否確實？海一氏當即很肯定的答稱，在專制獨裁政體之下，行政效率或能稍高。過去希特勒之獨裁作風即如此。然而人民的權益與自由却因此而遭受極大的損失，此種損失決不能以行政效率提高後所得之收獲來抵償。在共匪區內之人民，受盡剝削壓迫，使他們更覺得共匪專橫政治之可懼，民主政治之可貴。</p>
<p>私有土地　强被公分</p>
<p>記者又問，國外一部份人士對共匪土地政策頗多好評，其實際情形究竟如何？海氏謂，共匪的所謂均分土地實是欺人的政策。舉例而言，海氏有一友人擁地八十餘畝，但這是他們族中四十餘人所共有的產業，然族中尚未分家，如果一分，即舞人僅得二畝地，而共匪却硬說他們是大地主，拿他們的田地强行公分。「其實，八十餘畝地那能說是大地主？」海氏繼稱，「在美國有幾百英畝的地主是很普通的。我是一個窮敎士，亦有地五百餘英畝（按一英畝等於六·〇七市畝）。假如我是中國人住在匪區內，則他們豈不也要拿我的田地均分了嗎」？</p>
<p>全面援助　遲早必來</p>
<p>海氏對於目前中央的政治情形，亦發表其感想，認爲政府行政效率應提高，民衆的組織更須深入，吏治當從速澄淸，以提高民衆對政府之信心。在軍事方面，渠以爲士氣必須提高，剿匪的大戰略應採取以毒攻毒的方式，廣泛的展開游擊戰，使共匪處處受到打擊。海氏並具有很大信心的說，美國人民和政府遲早會瞭解中國的情形，同時也早晚要予中國以全面援助的。</p>
<h3>兩路客貨運費增加　商會電請政府制止</h3>
<p>京滬鐵路管理局自調整客貨運費後，嘉興縣商會已首先呼籲，要求政府制止，本市市商會亦開始變應，昨分電行政院及交通部，請將兩路客貨運費另作合理之調整，並指責路局此一行動，實與政府抑平物價安定經濟之政策背道而馳。商會提出之理由，爲運費劇增以後，工商成本亦增，勢必刺激物價劇烈上漲，且路局平術收支，開源之外，尚可節流，裁汰冗員，節制浪費，未必不足爲促促成收支平衡之助，奈竟竭澤而漁，專事激增運價，故諭政府令飭京滬鐵路管理局停止狂增客貨運費之舉，另作合理之調整云。</p>
<h3>中國機械工程學會　上海分會宣告成立</h3>
<p>中國機械工程學會總會自廿五年夏成立以來，各地會員已逾千餘人，抗戰時上海會務停頓，勝利後各地會員復員，上海區工程界人士汪經鎔·張恭聘·胡嵩嵒等二十餘人，發起　設分會，並發動六千萬不募款籌建會所，茲巳在交通大學恭綽堂內成立臨時會所，並於昨晨十時在交大恭綽堂召開成立大會，到中國工程學會總會會長程孝剛等五十餘人，由黃伯樵任臨時主席。交大敎授胡嵩嵒報告籌備經過，通過會章，選舉陳石英爲首屆會長，胡嵩嵒爲副會長。二人皆爲交大工程學院敎授，並選舉李泰方·陳大　吳良弼·周承祐·袁不烈爲幹事，大會即告成立。繼由工程界耆宿黃伯樵致辭稱：希望上海分會除致力學術上發展硏究外，並盼會內完成自動機造船等技衛上的分工，組各專門委員會，並與工業各機構密切合作，充分發揮機械的效率云。</p>
<h3>嚴冬乾燥火災多　半月已燒六十次　千人義勇消防隊不易實現原因　很少人願意擔任辛苦危險工作</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕火災！火災！驚心怵目的火災道幾天又在市區接連發生。每一天，每一夜，不知有多多少少的半命財產犧性在火的狂燄中　根據市警局消防總處的統計，三十七年開始以來半個月以內，他們已經出動了六十九次，其中除七次是虛驚，二次是場屋特別救護外，濁救火災一共達六十次之多，雖然內中成災的僅有二十三次，其餘三十七次均能及早撲滅，但平均每天四次的火警，已够使我們感　　　可怕了。</p>
<p>火災與氣候有密切的關係，歷年慣例都是在十二月，一月，二月這三個月份內，火災的次數最多，爲害最烈。多的原因在於天氣寒冷乾燥，燃火取暖的情形增多，偶一不愼，就　　原之禍。如學遇到風勢勁厲，那就更一發不可收拾，所以在這嚴冬時令中，大家都應該加倍謹愼小心。</p>
<p>消防機構逐步充實</p>
<p>火災一發生，就靠消防處來灌救了。自從去年武定路大火以後，社會對於消防工作的重要已有新的認識，消防機構在各方的督促與協助之下逐步充實，一年來經費　人員，都增加不少，並提高待遇，添購工具，以期發揮更大的效能，保障市民的公共安全。</p>
<p>該處現在　　於警察局，總隊下分設九區區隊，消防人員包括辦事職負，技工，工役等現有八百六十七人。畫輛方面現有輕型梯帶車六輛，中型帮浦車十七輛，大型帮浦車十六輛，蒸氣帮浦車一輛，消防艇一艘，引曳帮浦車一輛，殘火　戒車六輛，特種車輛救險車照明車等十輛，救護車十七輛，其他公務車，運輸車，脚踏軍等六十六輛。灌水皮帶陳舊者均已廢棄，一年來另外添購了三萬四千餘呎。新的車輛也已在進行向國外定購，但因外歷困難等種種原因，短期內尚難實現。</p>
<p>有賴各部通力合作</p>
<p>消防工作要做得好，更有賴於相關部門的通力合作，舉例來說，失火地點的水源是撲滅火災的決定因素，如果水龍頭損壞，或者水源壓力過低，消防隊就無能爲力，但有許多市民却因此誤會消防隊袖手不救。又譬如近來南市及　法租界一帶常常斷電，遇到失火時必須臨時通知水電公司開放，對於搶救時間不無影　。凡此種種，都是消防工作技術上的困難，市政常局有鑒於此，已於去年十一月底成立消防委員會，由市政府，警察局，公用局，參議會，地方協會等公私團體組成，每月舉行例會一次，共同來討論解決消防上的種種問題。</p>
<h3>每一市民　應盡責任</h3>
<p>同時，因爲火災的危險對於每一個市民都有切身的關係；火災的防止，也是每一個市民應盡的責任，所以消防處企圖組織一千名的義勇消防隊來協助消防工作，但這一建議，去年由民政局轉給各保甲後迄今尚無下文。據說由於這一種工作太爲辛苦而危險，因此很少人願意來義務担任。事實上這是每一個市民的切身利害所關，消防處希望大家能明瞭其意義，應該一致米踴躍參加。</p>
<p>最後，讀者們請記住，萬一發生了火警，應該趕快打電話通知消防處，號碼是「一五四四〇」。</p>
<h3>美救濟粉到八千噸　今日登輪辦理接受　實行配售可望於三月份開始　所得款項撥充救濟經費</h3>
<p>美國救濟麵粉八千噸由加利福尼亞輪載運來華，已於十八日下午駛進浦江，停泊招商局第一碼頭·今日下午三時，救濟物資處理委會主委繆嘉銘，吳市長，潘議長，　美方代表等，將登輪舉行接收典禮，並對美方運輸人員表示慰問。</p>
<h3>繆嘉銘談話</h3>
<p>行政院美國救濟物資處理委員會主委繆嘉銘，於十八日接見記者，答復關於美國救濟物資處理情形之詢問稱：美國政府以約値三千萬美元之救濟物資贈予中國，該項物資計糧食部份，有麵粉五萬噸（其中一部份爲小麥），食米七萬五千噸，現正陸續運華，並已有一部份抵達上海。另有約値四百萬美元之醫藥衛生器材，則已由衛生部開列需要淸單，送交美政府，不久亦可啓運來華。此外尚有少數肥料種籽，亦在救濟物資之列。</p>
<p>配售對象　國求普遍</p>
<p>美國糧食運華後，中國政府依照協定，在已辦有配售之都市，將採取適當步驟，確保各階層人民，獲得公正平等之份量·但因限於數量，故先由人口稠密糧食缺乏之五市，實行配售。其配售對象將力求普遍，務使人人均能沾益。有關糧食配售之一切準備工作，現正由五市當局分組市配售委員會，分頭進行。配售之具體辦法，亦正由本會與各市委會詳細策劃中。京滬市委會已成立，平津穗市委會亦將陸續成立，將來各市配售工作，即由市委會負賣，委托政府機關及志願機情執行之。現在預計運華之美糧，以十二萬五千噸計，依五市人口平均分配，並擬定以四個月爲期，據初步統計，每人每月可獲得糧食約五市升。至於配售價格，脟較市價爲低。每月調整一次，以期遠到穩定糧價之目的。此項配售工作，可望於三月份開始。</p>
<p>配送狀況　隨時發表</p>
<p>至本會對於救濟物資之處　，決一本公平原則。工　進行絕對公開。本會行政會計，請主計處派員辦理，　務會計，係委托會計師辦理，出納則由國家銀行代辦。物資戰埠，以及配售狀况，亦將隨時發表報告。則魯所得資金，依照協定，以全數充作救濟用費，此爲糧食部分</p>
<p>醫藥器材　俱可申請</p>
<p>關於醫藥衛生器材部份，亦正由主管機關妥擬辦法，將來一面以醫藥器材實施直接救濟，一面以一部份醫藥器材出售，所得資金亦悉充救濟事業之用。該項資金之分配以則經全國爲原則，凡公私　舊任何建設性或救濟性事業，急需補助者，均可詳擬計劃，向本會提出申請，由本會會同美方審核撥付·本會爲籌劃救濟工作起見，並已成立衛生醫藥及社會救濟爾委員會，聘請由美雙方專家參加，負責設計，審核各方請求協助之計劃。</p>

<h3>準格爾旗青年司令　奇致中少將　曁蒙旗內幕</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏十一日航訊〕自從準格爾旗的保安騎兵，在榆林被圍時，擋住共匪由河曲西渡，並且收復了府谷縣城以後，二十七歲的奇致中司令，又使衰落了十五年的楊家灣，重新成為晋陝綏邊區的軍事政治和財富的中心。同時楊家灣的奇姓貴族，又在蒙漢人民的心目中，佔有了奇致中祖父那森達賴時代的顯赫地位。準格爾旗楊家灣的奇姓貴族，是綏蒙的一個最不平凡的家庭，記者本言語，就是要拿楊家灣奇姓這個權勢家庭和奇致中這個青年司令，追述蒙旗過去的政治內幕，說明蒙旗今後所走的道路。</p>
<p>奇致中的家庭　是從他的祖父那森達賴開始發跡，那公雖係成吉思汗的嫡系子孫，但最初有慣無職，屬於一種坐吃山空的閒散王公，所以幼年時非常貧困，不得不替扎薩克充當箭丁。後來因爲那公身體高大，打仗英勇，便掌有軍權，在前年病逝的準格爾旗扎薩克奇治國的祖父喀王時代，就以世襲鎭國公台吉，担任了準格爾旗最有權力的東協理，所以晋陝綏邊區的老百姓稱他爲「那公爺」和「大漢台吉」或「大漢官府」。到奇冶國的父親阿王死後，那公更以東協理護理了扎薩克印務，從光緒三十四年一直執政到民國二十一年陰曆正月。</p>
<p>奇致中少將</p>
<p>那公　握軍權政權後，便給準格旗展閒一個新的時代，他從軍事，政治，經濟三方面做建設工作，比世襲的扎薩克有許多進步的作風。因爲準格爾旗和秦晋兩省祇隔着長城黃河，所以蒙民完全漢化，使得那公能延請河曲府谷的落魄文人和失意軍官，替他改革舊政，訓練新軍，取得伊盟的領導地位。那公的　絃夫人，是一偶滿旗小姐，她很開明的讓兒子奇子俊到北平讀書，後來由北京大學畢業，並赴庫倫留學，回來呌各召廟的喇嘛還　，成立同仁學校，培養旗內的蒙漢子弟，和同一時期赴外蒙受訓的鳥審旗的什泥喇嘛，鄂托克旗的章文軒，被封建王公目爲伊盟的危險人物。</p>
<p>奇子俊父子生前，曾經給晉陝綏邊區做出許多福利事業。宣統初平陝北大旱，那森達賴撥出五萬兩白銀救災，並資助府谷神木的飢民，到</p>
<p>準格爾旗墾荒　此舉除給準格爾旗增加了十萬多人口，並且給他自己造成一個由府谷到薩拉齊縣，擁有五百里狹長田產的地主，因此抗戰期間，楊家灣能供應馬占山將軍的騎兵，達六年之久。辛亥革命後，天下大亂，那森達賴剿平在河曲府谷流竄的蘇雨生部股匪；民國十六年奉軍派王英率領的土匪，假道準格爾旗進攻山西河曲，奇子俊自動將楊家灣點火燒毀，來了一個空室淸野，從此土匪再不敢進人準格爾旗邊境。</p>
<p>那森達賴的許多作法，深得人民擁戴，却遭受到其它仕官的反對，他爲了完成統一，屠殺了旗內不少叛徒，以敎留下仇恨的禍根。當時有一個名呌阿勒坦瓦濟爾的管旗章京，反對那公最力，遭受那公逮捕，　死獄中，他的兒子奇壽山跑到中央軍校受訓，畢業後不敢回旗，在軍訓部任職，民國十八年奇子俊以國府監察委員到南京開會，他以寬大的胸懷，把奇　山帶回準格爾旗。那公呌奇壽山練兵，奇子俊主政，並將沙圪堵·納林·五字灣·暖水四鎭闢成商埠，給了奇壽山許多財產，想把準格爾旗建設成一個模範蒙旗。不料奇壽山經旗內的對建人物挑撥，於二十一年正月初一到楊家灣拜年時，以子報父仇爲名，把奇子俊父子擊斃，使那森達賴的英雄抱負沒有完成。</p>
<p>那森達賴遺像</p>
<p>奇壽山殺死奇子俊父子，那森達賴的營長耳居白彥（即去年被人刺殺的奇文英司令），又將奇壽山打死，代替了那森選賴的軍政地位。奇文英和他的孫子奇湧泉，祖孫分任東西協理，奇文英除了護理扎薩克印務，並掌有準格爾旗保安司令及蒙古第一游擊區司令兩顆軍印，比那森達賴的權力還大。奇子俊父子的繼承者奇致中，在他祖父和叔父被害後，祇有十二歲秩齡，奇文英把那森達賴的軍隊帶到神出，（奇文英的府邸），僅給楊家灣留下一速看守田園的家兵。奇致中經他祖母敎養成人後，沒有六七年工夫，以自己的財產招兵買馬，到抗戰開始就擴充成一團精壯的騎兵。</p>
<p>這一個纓簪子弟，第一次出現在準格爾旗的政治舞台，是從協助阿王的兒子奇治國用印那天開始。阿王病死後，他的兒子的印務，一直由那森達賴和奇文英護理，到民國三十年奇治國已到了法定的爵位年齡，並且非常英俊有爲，但是奇文英不願把印繳出，所以奇致國團結楊家灣的奇致中，和前淸時被貽穀將軍殺死的喀王的東協理丹片爾的孫子奇尚斌（現任準旗東協理）等青年，經馬占山派兵鎭　，才把準格爾的王印從神山送到德盛西的王府。從此奇致中成了準旗</p>
<p>新政權的支柱和神山的奇文英形成準格爾旗新舊兩支勢力。日本投降以前奇治國因虛病逝世，奇致中帶兵離開德盛西，協助馬占山將軍防守河曲，與南坪的奇尚斌，跟奇文英把準應爾旗劃成東西兩個局面。日本投降以後，馬占山將軍帶兵離開伊盟，臨走給他留下許多幹部和武器，楊家灣的勢力，越發蒸蒸日上。</p>
<p>去年夏天，奇文英被他孫子奇湧泉的前任西協理奇鳳鳴的侄十奇子祥派刺客暗殺，奇致中即由楊家灣出兵，將叛軍繳械，使全旗沒有騷動，省府當下發表他繼奇文英爲準格爾旗保安司令。以後旗務委員會成立，由奇文英的孫子奇湧泉担任主任委員，奇致中兼委員並兼財政科長。旗務委員會代替過去的王府，因爲奇致中掌有羣衆和財富，使他有很雄厚的政治資本，所以現在的楊家灣，又成了晋陝綏邊區的軍事政治和財當的中心。今年奇致中除了派兵收復府谷，還幹了一件剷除封建勢力的工作，事實的經過情形是這樣：原來奇文英被刺後，準格爾旗成立的旗務委員曾，很被伊盟各旗的王公反對，國王沒有經過遠省政府的許可，便直接向中央保舉丹片爾台吉孫子奇尚斌，繼奇文英爲準格爾旗東協理，並保舉奇治國的近親奇福海爲扎薩克。奇致中爲打倒王公制度，於今年五月間趁奇尚斌奔走郡王旗的機會，以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，將奇尚斌的軍隊完全解決，使奇尚斌和奇福海困在歸綏，直到現在不能回德盛西王府接印。</p>
<p>奇子俊遺像</p>
<p>奇致中司令左共　　邊北犯的今天，他　地位益形重要　現在準格爾旗共有四大集團，除了楊家灣的奇致中，還有神山的奇湧泉，和德盛西的奇治國的母親及流亡在歸綏的奇福海與奇尚斌，暨準格爾旗河套黨三　子的奇子祥。奇湧泉現在兼任旗務委員會主任委員，並掌有他祖父奇文英留的三團騎兵，編爲伊邊警備第一區司令，可是他的聲望不如奇致中財富不如奇致中，幹部也不如奇致中堅强。故扎薩克奇治國的母親祗有一國家兵，她企圖垂廉聽政的傀儡王爺奇福海和攝政奇尚斌暫時無法回旗，並且團長郝德明和奇致中的關係非常密切。奇子祥因奇文英案被捕獲釋，現在帶兵在察北剿匪，不能回旗過問內政。所以今後準格爾旗的治亂，和晋陝綏邊區安危，奇致中要起很大的決定作用。</p>
<p>奇致中司令雖然是個蒙古人，但不懂蒙文業語，說得是河曲府谷兩縣混合的漢話，他沒有進過近代學校，但有很好的四書五經根底，談吐非常文雅，由於看報的緣故，常識相當豐富。奇致中有貴族子弟的氣槪，他說「我祗信仰兩個人，一個是蔣委員一個是傅長官，馬將軍我也聽老人家的話」。他認為準格爾旗的互相仇殺，是蒙旗的最大創傷，今後唯一避免的方法，便是實行民主，他說「現在中央成天要實行憲政，為什麼還允許王公制度在蒙旗存在，眞叫我們不能解釋」。談到內蒙自治問題，奇致中司令肯定的說：「我們早已實行自治，現在缺少的是進步。」（記者劉映元）</p>

<h3>一舞傾心再舞定情　「英雄美人」在揚州　雙雙捉將官裏去</h3>
<p>〔本報揚州十四日訊〕此間日前發生一冒充軍官案，因事出離奇，一時轟傳遐邇，鬧得風雨滿城。緣近日揚城，時見一身着軍服配少將領軍之翩翩少年，偕一濃裝　抹之妙齡女郞，漫步街頭，尤其在茶社酒樓，座客對此熔熔星光之「少將」，無不投以艷羨之眼光，惟流光迅速，倏已經旬，而此對「英雄美人」仍然優遊街頭，無所事事，致引起警局注意。當查得該「少將」名王煥文，年二十八歲，山東濰縣人，女郞爲萬「夫人」，名陳麗萍，同居於舊城九號十一號，詎王「少將」飽食終日，閒得無聊，竟不時邀同鄰近勞工作竹城之遊，筆挺軍服，與赤足裸體同桌娛樂，十足表現其「民主作風」，「軍民合作」。警局獲此情報後，程巡官毅然參加遊戲，於閒話時，識破王「少將」袖內機關，翌日調查戶口時，復在其臥室內發現有僞造第二綏靖區司令部旅行證明書兩件，身份證一紙，司令官王耀武私章四方，勝利勛章二枚，步槍十彈二十發。至此秘密揭穿，王「少將」與陳麗萍乃被「護送」警局，經訊問後，據王煥文供稱：又名「王輝」，「生斌」，對僞造文件及王耀武私章，育認不諱，並稱業已發出僞造文件二張，過去往來於京滬之間，最近始偕妻來揚小憇。另據陳麗萍供稱：曾在上海米高梅舞應爲舞女，因愛王風姿，一舞傾心，再舞定情，係於舊曆十月初與王同居，對王之身份及家庭並不瞭然，現時生活，悉賴其變賣金飾維持，言時蛾眉緊蹙，似有不勝失足之慨。警局據供後，恐此案涉有其他嫌疑，乃將「英雄美人」一倂移送縣府，押候偵查，　其鐵窗風味矣。（圖：陳麗萍）</p>

<h3>華僑在古巴　從僕傭蛻化為領袖</h3>
<p>〔本報古巴十三日航訊〕此間梅公使景周，最近著文叙述古巴華僑之偉績，刊諸夏　拿世界日報已喚起閱者注意，茲將全文　譯如次：國人來居古巴已滿百年，初甚貧苦，慘淡經營，且嘗爲自由而奮鬥，由田備以迄富商，其進步之速，令人驚嘆。</p>
<p>國人初到古巴，爲人作僕傭，土人呼之爲小呂宋的華人，蓋彼等皆來自該地也。其有田莊之經臉者，僅屬少數。當時菲列濱農業不甚發達，且菲洲黑奴之販賣較爲有利，若輩華人已習西班牙語，而同化於西班牙文化者甚多。其次則爲福建人之移殖，乃由小呂宋之西班牙人所召僱而來，多數爲「客家」。彼等在家鄉中被視爲非土著民族，因受壓迫而急欲出洋，來古巴之一部份，少有基督敎徒，自一八四七年起，如是者凡十年。我華人皆係</p>
<p>良善工人，為西政牙人所魚肉，自一八四七以至一八七七年在古巴中國工人之移殖，歷時三十年，蓋自禁止販賣黑奴之後，彼等乃被運來以替待之。</p>
<p>哇路維特氏之著述有言：「自工人缺乏，不得不尋求代替黑奴之工人，於是昧盡天良之商人，乃思運入托名傭工之中國人，由是黑奴一變而爲中國奴，其所受不人道之待遇，更有甚焉。「西班牙人爲欲制止華人期滿後恢復自由，乃使被等簽具合同，自願放棄。</p>
<p>國人生性能於</p>
<p>千辛萬苦　中勞作，尤是惹禍之根，名著者基羅氏發現黑人往往在廣大之烟糖棉花等植園操勞致死，而國人却能於嚴酷之熱帶地繁殖，此種不幸之環境，反令彼等憧憬於解放及政治社會方面之澈底改善，於是當古巴獨立運動時，被等乃表現顯著的功績。</p>
<p>國人之在澳門被拐帶販賣者甚衆，佯言運往小呂宋，實則被遣至大呂宋。（西班牙及其嚴地之統稱），太平洋之航程頗遠，船中輒有暴動及瘟疫發生，其能抵達目的地者，有時僅及百分之三十，如有百分之五十生存，則屬順利之航行，彼等</p>
<p>月薪八元　，船費及路上食佣，均一律自付。</p>
<p>當時古巴之情形更屬可佈，彼等到時，適在奧東尼魯將軍之社會動盪及專政時期，登陸後即被遼至云丹省建造新糖寮，多數被</p>
<p>中古協定　以為改善之方，駐廣州及澳門之西班牙領事聖威爾奴哇，對於章程之訂立頗爲努力，繼有其他增訂之章程，如一八六一年法令，則為居留古巴華僑力爭之結果。自一八六八年十月十日古巴革命開始，以迄第一次獨立戰爭，殖民地之賄賂，違於極點，杜魯西將軍欲加制止，致被迫離職。在羅哈將軍任內，投機事業更多，甚至我華工合同亦作買賣，我國政府曾提出嚴重抗議，在巴魯馬西打伯爵任內，我華人之被迫在胡加羅以至毛隆等處</p>
<p>堡壘工作　者，起而反抗，並加入革命軍，他處華人則有逃入森林者，彼等常出沒於甘馬圭東省拉士威也土云丹等戰爭中，結果留在堡蠱中工作之國人，則愈受虐待。；國人因參加一八七三年之戰而曼剝削，至是更為明　清廷乃派著名之陳蘭彬氏來古交涉，（一八七四年）陳氏所遺留於夏灣拿之印象，僅其個人之身份顯赫，舉止　　而已。拉都氏在其「華人來古史要」一案中，描寫陳氏之如何殷勤款待，而獲得古巴人之歡心，陳氏所能减輕華僑痛苦之成就，至屬低微，然其後馬德里條約則開端於此，故陳氏此行亦未嘗無功（古巴·夏灣拿）關於華僑參加</p>
<p>十年戰爭之功績，古巴人方面已多有詳細之記載，克沙達在其「華人與古巴之獨立」一書中。曾贊曰「華人戰士中，人無有奸細或逃伍者」。此書近年復有新版。</p>
<p>華人之參加作戰旣如此重要，故當一八七八年二月十日古巴人向西班牙人投降時，要求增訂條件一條，使華人等得享受赦免及解放之權，卒獲批准。其後在白朗高任內，夏灣拿中國領事館於以成立，並頒行法規，廢止此項勞工合同。此等華人乃有從事商業及甘蔗生菓等種植，及至一八九五年之戰事發生，華僑復投軍，以爲古巴爭取自由之助力，其於獨立戰史中，名垂不巧者，有如胡上校，賴華上校等，渠等頗受古巴人之崇敬。經此戰後，古巴屹然成一獨立共和國，華僑則案策羣力，以參加古巴</p>
<p>復興工作　其有優裕積蓄而際此時艱蕩然一空者，亦復不少，雖欲歸國一而不可得，遂成家於此。今則凡百事業，多有彼等從中領導，我華人經濟與社會地位蒸蒸日上，而日臻於繁榮，其後裔間有榮膺古巴政府之要職者。學歷之造就，較諸先人更勝一籌，足堪效力於古巴前途之發展與增進中古之友誼。總之，華人在古巴之歷史凡一百年，其最特出之點，厥爲由田傭變爲富商，其間雖有言語文化環境種族之艱難，而我華人乃能以柔克剛，以順受逆，刻苦砥礪，努力奮鬥，卒底於勝利之途。由農工而商買，由商賈而領袖，此三階段之過程，賣爲我華人對於古巴有價値貢獻之過程。（佩梅）</p>

<h3>東歐內情</h3>
<p>— 薩本耿</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕四國外長敦倫敦會議的「不歡而散」，反映英美與蘇聯在歐洲大陸上的矛盾。對於東歐各國的控制，乃是蘇聯干領德奧關切法意的前哨基地，也是蘇聯參加世界政治的重要資本之一。這些所謂東歐各國，主要的是南斯拉夫，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，波蘭，匈牙利與捷克，通常被認為蘇聯「鐵幕」以內的國家。旣然有「鐵幕」的雅號，可以想像到欲求了解的不易，但是「鐵幕」外緣終究與「鐵幕」核心是不同的，因此，我們多少還可以知道一些，幷且在今天，也很有知道一些的必要</p>
<p>先由南斯拉夫與保加利亞說起：兩個國家，自今年（一九四七）年起初，政府即已在共產黨控制之下，反對黨沒有力量可言。在共產黨控制下之兩國政府，主要的政策是如何以肅淸反對黨的殘餘分子以及如何以隔絕本國人民與外國人的來往（這裏所謂外國，當然是指非共產黨控制的國家而言　）根據這個政策，自然不能不大興刑獄。舉其主要者，在南斯拉夫，如自由主義分子方蘭敎授之被判無期徒刑，耶芬非之被判九年徒刑；在保加利亞，如柏可夫之處死刑，斯坦基夫之被判無期徒刑。這些刑獄，大致都是由於此輩平日或與西歐人士往返，或在國會演講或私人談話中批評共產主義而起。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞之情形與此類似，政府雖係「聯合」性質，但作爲政府反對黨之農民黨，不僅受壓迫，而其領袖，包括不久以前被捕之孟紐，均被判長期徒刑。另外兩個參加聯合政府之政黨，—社會黨與自由黨，以其意見與共產黨不同，己被肅淸。社會黨被迫與其他「工人政黨」合併，自由黨則以國會不信任投票之方式，被迫退出政府。</p>
<p>波蘭與匈牙利之情形，與上述三國，在程度上略有不同。波蘭農民黨領袖密可來克最近輾轉逃亡英國，近已前往美國，另有若十人員，則被逮捕。但參加波蘭政府之波蘭社會黨尚在勉强支特其「獨立」而未與其他政黨合倂。匈牙利亦係被共產黨認爲去「眞正民主」尚有若干距離者，在匈牙利度頗形得勢之小農民黨，目前已在事實上受共產黨之支配。但在匈牙利聯合政府中，尚有三個政黨，約佔國會三分之一的議席，被認爲右傾者。其中之一的「匈牙利獨立黨」己受壓迫，領袖飛非亦己離國。在波蘭政府之中，社會黨尚在支持其名義上的「獨立」。其領袖沙克斯特（Szakasit）近仍發表其反對與他黨合併之演說，但能支持多久，亦係問題。</p>
<p>最主要之國家，當爲捷克，它大約是東歐各國中政治自由最大而法治亦己逐漸恢復的國家，其被共產黨控制的程度亦稍差。但在今年七月間，捷克政府在事實上是被迫在最後一秒鐘中，放棄接受巴黎會議的邀請。自是以來，共產黨及其「同路人」，正加强其迫使捷克政府左轄中。十月間捷克政府公布之五年計劃，即爲使捷克與西方國家斷絕關係之經濟上的改造。共產黨目前之策略，似爲如何在國會中佔據多數，以求打倒自戰事結束以來左在於捷克之國民陣綫（NationdFront）各政黨。</p>
<p>如上所述，可知東歐各國的情形，大致可以分做兩部份：一部份爲南斯拉夫，保牙利亞與羅馬尼亞。這三個國家在事實上已是一黨專政的國家，也就是共產黨控制的國家。另一部份是波蘭，匈牙利與捷克。這三個國家雖則受到共產黨的威脅，但是目前還可能與西歐國家接觸。不過這種情形，也只是表面的，幷且可能是短期的，因爲共產黨的實際力量，已能控制，由於捷克之拒絕參加巴黎曾議（起先是答應參加的，臨時被迫拒絕）波蘭農民黨領袖之出奔，（在傎正民主的國家，當然不會有此必要）匈牙利獨立黨領袖之出國，可以想見。至於什麼時候，共產黨在這些國家中組織一黨政府，大約要看地們對於國際局勢的衡量，這是共產黨的策略問題。當然的，這裏也有一個可能，即以捷克與波蘭人民之國家觀念，來克服當前的危機，但在今日，這個可能的力量，是很難估計的。（卅六年聖誕節後一天，倫敦。）</p>

<h3>逸園羣英大會　藍白戰成和局　埠際足球二次試賽　各得一球未分勝負</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕天時和暖，逸園塲上，昨日下午羣英畢集，埠際足球選找代表，舉行第二次試賽，出塲者中西健將三十各，仍分藍白兩隊，結果各一和局，未分勝負，上半時各無紀綠。球迷八九千人，盛極一時。</p>
<p>藍攻白守</p>
<p>藍白兩隊，陣容編配，藍隊攻勝於守，白隊守勝於攻。上半時踢來當緊張精彩，下半時陳勢調動，頓見　動散漫。藍隊前鋒在黃毛勞勃司托夫領導下，活躍非凡，致使白隊後衛及中衛，不得不退後防守，演成藍攻白守之戰。白隊因而中衛與前鋒，陷於脫節，益以羅壽福之軟弱，白隊前鋒，似見發展困難。藍隊之守衛中，中衛綫相當不差，鐵伏尼頗能獨擋一面也。</p>
<p>上半時　未開紀錄</p>
<p>白隊張邦綸陳家萬吳祺祥韓尼波瞿永福高保正卡洛列區　羅壽福　韓龍海李義臣陳明哲</p>
<p>藍隊秦必高F許而茲張林根愛德華鐵伏尼麥律希金祿生勞勃司托夫夏體先費春華</p>
<p>裁判張樂，巡邊吳守衡，鄧效良。白隊衣東華會之紅色球衣，藍隊則爲靑白會之靑白色球衣。列陣如上，鳴笛開賽。藍隊先攻三分鐘時，夏體先獲球攻門，張邦綸撲空，小黃毛正待發脚，陳家萬解圍得救。未幾，金祿生左角力射，一飛冲天。十二分鐘時，白隊陳明哲右角切中，球落藍隊門前，惜卡洛列區來遲一步。卡洛列區捲土重來，長傳中央，龍海迎球一頂，泰必高猿臂抱住。混戰至三十分鐘時，藍隊愛德華於門外廿碼附近，手拉懶半，李義臣主罰，未收效果，陳明哲再度叩門，秦必高候假正着。藍隊夏體先於白隊門前猛射，中橫木彈出。上半鴨蛋一雙。</p>
<p>下半時　各一和局</p>
<p>易地再戰，兩隊陣容各有更動，排列如下：</p>
<p>藍隊秦必高許而茲F格里非可愛德華　錢長榮　鐵伏尼　麥律希羅壽福勞勃司托夫</p>
<p>白隊張邦綸里士堡　陳家萬　李義臣韓尼液孟義良高保正卡洛列區格里納司高秀淸</p>
<p>白隊先攻，你來我往，混戰多時，至十二分鐘後，夏體先單槍匹馬，活躍萬分，一脚猛射，首破白門。白隊全力回擊。二分鐘後，錢長榮禁區手吻皮球，李義臣輕送十二碼，恰中秦必高懷抱未克成功。至十七分鐘，陳家萬脚傷離塲，里士堡入補，李義臣移左。以後戰况益趨熱烈。至卅三分時，高保正又傷足，陸炳生入替，藍隊錢長榮退伍，鐵伏尼重作馮婦，至終塲前七分鐘時，格里納司遠射建功，白隊一比一扳成和局。銀角養鳴，各米分勝負。</p>

<h3>大公初遭滑鐵盧　晨友以一分獲勝　籃球聯賽昨晚出冷門</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕晨友籃球隊，昨晚在籃球聯賽中，大出冷門，竟以寶貴之一分，繫敗常勝軍大公隊，給果五一比五十，上半時廿五比廿九，晨友落後四分。千餘球迷，大爲驚異。晨友年靑力壯，埋頭苦練，昨晚表演確甚精彩，前次以一分敗於無聯，昨以一分擊敗大公，似非偶然。王炳福妙射　中，得心應手，有如紳助。大公不無輕敵，陷入苦戰，過度緊張，表演失常，終遭慘敗　深為可惜。</p>
<p>劉荷生金伯隗執法，晨友王炳福光開紀錄。大公施威以十一比二居先。晨友反擊，漸漸接近，戰況緊張異常，上半時完畢，晨友令以廿五比廿九落後四分。</p>
<p>休息再戰，大公陣容未動，晨友季有崑入塌，調出王蓉生，久全首破紅心，文章立刻回敬，晨友何增領空中的，追成各卅一平手。大公鎭靜應付，然形勢極度緊張，分數此起彼落，互爭先後。晨友小王百步穿楊，獲分累累，四七比四一，大公陷入苦戰，四次呼停，密商對策，五一比四五時，大公亦五次求停。文龍罰球得點，文華遠中，忠强破籃，五一比五十，追成相差僅半球。將近終塲前一分數十秒時，大公緊張過度，晨友六次呼停，罰球，文章文華竟告不中。否則扳成平手，尙有生機。未幾時間告終，晨友以五一比五〇分，一分之</p>

<h3>銀根回緊聲中　退票數字又增加　當局管理金融繼續澈查</h3>
<p>銀根回緊聲中，最近票據交換退票數字又見增加，金融管理當局繼續派員澈查退票。據悉：當局決依據「加强金融業務管理辦法」，凡商營行莊在交換所退票金額，佔該行莊當日交換總額百分之五以上，連續三次，經查明顯有藉辭退票，以圖軋平交換差額者，得由當地金融管理機關規定限期，飭令調整頭寸，並飭當地行莊，在限期內停止對該行拆放欲項。</p>
<h3>行莊放款匯款數　應吾報金管局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部滬津　漢四地金融管理局業己先後成立。所有各該轄區銀行錢莊之業務報告，除各商業行莊信託公司，及省市銀行每月底應行編選之月計表及放款對象分類兩種外，茲悉，財部己着另訂匯出入匯款報告表一種，一律自卅七年一月份起，改送各該管管理局查核。各該轄區內各國家行局庫（中央銀行除外）之對外營業單位，除應按月塡製月計表及放款對象分類表外，並應遵照加强金融業務管制辦法第二條乙項之規定，每日將當日承辦之放款及匯出匯入款項，分別逐筆按地名列表，一倂陳送各該管管理局審核云。</p>
<h3>購麥代磨合同</h3>
<p>體食部委託本市福新·阜豐·茂新·華　·裕通等五大麵粉廠購麥代磨，供應各地民食。第一期共收麥一百七十萬担，至今已磨製一百二十萬担，製粉約達一百八十萬包。茲悉糧食部最近業與各大粉廠續訂第二期購麥代磨合同，預定收購小麥三十萬担，麥款由中農銀行隨收隨付。據聯合收麥處稱：該處區己收購十餘萬担，准目前因交通困難，來源稀少，收麥工作甚難迅速展開云。</p>
<h3>染織業聯誼會決議　呈請開放工業貸欵</h3>
<p>昨日（十八）本市暨武進·無錫·吳縣·常熟·江陰·等六市縣染織業聯誼會，在閔行文綺染織專科學校舉行第九屆代表大會。出席代表計無錫王海潤，武進查秉初，吳縣馬春霖，常熟徐質彬，江陰徐舜年，及上海潘士浩諸尚一闕萍沚王韶鈞等，共八十餘人。討論提案，議決一·請政府開放年終緊急工貸，二·呈請花紗布管理委員會，展緩複製業廠商登記，三·减免染織業營業稅，四·開放華南棉布轉口，五·組織紗布聯合配銷硏究委員會，六·商請本市棉紗市塲發給外埠告縣出入證等要案多件。繼由文綺專科學校全體師生聯歡招待，並攝影留念，情况至爲熱烈。晚應上海市染織業公會在國際飯店歡宴而散。</p>
<h3>米業權威表示　米價可長期穩定</h3>
<p>京滬平津穗五大都市糧食，即將實施仝面配給，連日米價漲風已平，人心安定，各　米價較晨高峯時已下跌十餘萬元。據米業權威方面透露，米價前途尚將劇跌，其原因如次：　此次米價，由六十餘萬元直綫上漲至十百五十萬元，漲勢較其他物價爲狂暴，故依經濟原理，其跌風亦當甚烈，可能回至一百萬元內。　京滬二地食米消耗，占江浙兩省消爲量最多，茲巨額洋米已運到，二地即將開始配售。蘇錫蕪嘉食米產區需要量减低，當將續跌。　一月來市民購貯食米頗多，普通家庭均已購貯食米數月，故連日門售各米店，銷路均銳减。　銀根續緊，囤戶脫手，依據過去經驗，米市可有長時期之穩定云輪船火車定限額</p>
<h3>飛機禁運現鈔　輪船火車定限額</h3>
<p>〔聯合徵信所訊〕財部爲限制現鈔運滬，刺激物價，已制訂辦法，即可公佈實施。此次辦法內容：　飛機絕對禁止携運現鈔，　輪船火車，可運定額之現鈔，　如超過定額，須呈明正當用途，向當地金融管理局中請核發准運證，　如超過定額，未經申請核准者，其超出部份，一經查出，即强迫存儲入限期取用。此項定額，財部正斟酌情形訂定中。</p>
<h3>中華水產公司　今日正式成立</h3>
<p>農林部中華水產公司籌備二年，已定於今日正式成立。該公司前由政府決定准由人民投炎一半，故新公司決以現有全部資產充行官股，另招與官股等値之商股，合組　監事會。招股事宜正進行中。至全部資產，去年九月份估計價値一，一七五億元，包括華勝鋼廠，華利船廠，魚肝油廠，鳳尾魚廠，冷藏庫製冰廠四所，暨新式漁船十二艘。</p>
<h3>去年全國桐油輸出　總計約七萬三千噸　售得外匯約值三千萬美元</h3>
<p>據有關方面精確統計：卅六年全國桐油輸出總量，共約七萬三千噸。由滬運出者，約三萬九千噸，佔總數百分之五十四。由港運出者，約三萬三千六百噸，佔總數百分之四十六。據估計，其中除香港走私一萬餘噸外，去年桐油輸出所得外匯，約値美金三千萬元。以中國植物油料廠佔最大多數，其次則爲義瑞·生利等·輸出國別美居首位，共約四萬八千噸，佔全數百分之六十六。英爲七千八百噸，佔百分之十一。歡陸各國共約一萬一千噸，佔百分之十五·印·淡·加·南非·日本等國，共約二千五百噸，佔百分之三。中信局對蘇易貨三千一百噸，佔百分之四。去年桐油出口數量，比之戰前（一九三五年至一九三九年間，每年平均出口七萬四千噸）相差不遠，若比照前年度數字，則　已增加百分之八十四矣。考其原因，則係政府對推廣輸出，鼓勵外銷，採取種種措施，自平衛基金委員會成立後，外匯隨時調整，出口商得趨活躍，兼以各地桐油輸出商及桐油同業，擁護國策，通力合作所致。此外如中信局奉命辦理收購政策，雖其經營方式，一時未能盡合出口商舊習慣，問有認爲與民爭利之嫌，然當我國桐油在國外無行市時，該局收購，對出口商亦有相當裨益。據業中人歡察，照谷產地報告情形佔計，今年桐油收成殊佳，並預料將來外銷總數，不致比去年减少。所可顧慮者，產量略嫌不敷供應耳。其理由爲中港協完實施後，華南走私漸减，行市自可漸趨穩定。又據估計，美國今年每月桐油需要量，約可增至五千噸，依膨去年輸出總數，祇足供美國所需。再以英國年需一萬噸，及歐陸各地計算在內，自成求過於供之現象。　美國需要量增加，主因在於戰後我國桐油源源供應，逐漸恢復　時水準，故已不再使用代替品。關於國外市價，美國於上月份自我國輸入桐油約八千噸之多，加之該國新油上市，致價格平疲，紐約棧房交貨，每磅二角六分美元。英國則為桶裝，每英噸爲一八五英磅。國內價格上海　市担三二〇萬元，漢口二四五萬元，重元〇〇　　　，　　。又悉，我國桐油前途所感困難者，則爲交通問題。除逐輸時這阻滯外，運費增高，使成本不能减輕。例如揚子江輪船業公會，原規定散倉桐油水脚列入第二類，現擬改列第四類，是則桐油輪出成本又將增高矣。</p>
<h3>冬季呢羢市況回顧　成本加重各貨迭創新高價</h3>
<p>今冬十月呢絨直錢上騰，因吃本步步加重，致其上漲亦鉅，升漲原因，係受金鈔黑市狂騰，與大票發行之刺激，以及進口貨無法定到，本廠貨產少而成本扯高。同時本客帮實銷暢達，大衆去幣易貨之心重熾，抱有早購早便宜之觀念。於是各貨暢銷，迭創新高價。</p>
<p>西服裏襯羽紗類，受絲紗原料暴漲，飛漲更疾，長毛絨上漲亦速。麥而登賣買變方均憾上漲太烈，大有不欲經營之心理。細毛貨花呢，多以章華貨躍漲一百萬元爲標準，麥而登上漲至六十八萬元爲之帶高許多。</p>
<p>馬褲呢駝斯錦女色呢，悉亦飛黃騰達，二十日起，則見急轉直下。平均統扯較之最高峰時，跌落一成以上。至廿七日方始止跌回平，然回顧上半個月行情，則仍是高出若干耳。</p>
<p>呢羢所以能突然縮跌者，係受經濟警察嚴密抄緝墨市及囤戶影響，而市府之努力壓平物價，央行之抽緊銀根，均有以促成之也。</p>
<p>十一月初旬，呢羢呈盤旋平穩局面，中旬內悉多縮疲下游，下句則全部告漲，在呢大衣呢等最佔秀色，市塲上利買消息頻傳，尤其爲公私開續激大，廠方自己現貨囤積，開繼續高，同時中紡配價亦復如此。</p>
<p>季冬貨價，齊多升漲，及至大票發行，郵資增漲，美匯一再掛升，火軍票及其他公用事業之再調整，米價高昂，日用品等騰漲，呢羢雖有中信局配給毛絲紗與呢羢，依然無濟於事，若銀根不抽緊，則其上漲之勢亦必更甚也。</p>
<p>麥而登及海白龍二種，上漲最可稱絕無僅有。烈，銷路方面，因頭襯之軋緊，本廠貨凡立丁則大有定交，花高利貸之逼迫，自聖誕節後，冬呢均看其再好，不肯定出。安凱銷相繼落令。本客帮銷賡續退化第本特洋行被經濟警員抄出做黑，交易有令乏整，定貨方面，除市後，一般洋行俱多戒心，開價香港一埠略有設法運申外，餘均先後均由美票改喊國幣。</p>

<h3>關於繼鈾元素　兼論中語言對名問題</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>自從一八七〇年孟特雷夫（Mendeleeff）以原子量次序排列的週期表公佈以後，化學界一致公認爲化學進步的里程碑，它使無數複雜而難以解決的問題趨於簡單，因爲孟氏週期表是以元素的化學性質的週期性與其原子價的關係排列而成的，各種元素的性質藉此得以預測斷定，像元素43·61·85·87等之硏究能够完善，胥賴週期表之協助，而原子量的測定準確，也賴週期表加以改正。</p>
<p>當然，週期表的缺點未始沒有，譬如說：氫（Hydrogen）在週期表中沒有適當的地位；稀土元素（Rare　earth　elements）不能依次列入表中，同位元素（Isotopes）在表中朱能明白指出；而化學性質相異的元素也有處於同組的；此外更有數處元素之排列次序並不依原于量的遞高順序。</p>
<p>但是，無諭如何，孟氏的週期表是偉大的，有了他的啓示，化學家們經過逐漸的硏究和改進，我們已經得到了一個相當完善的週期表，那就是按一九四〇年公布的國際原子量表所排列而成的週期表，從原子序數（Atomicnumber）爲一的氫起，至原子序數爲九十二的鈾止，共有九十二個元素。</p>
<p>在一九四〇年以前，科學家能够證明其存在於自然界中的，只有這九十二個元素，但是，週期表很明白的曉示我們，第七週期中各元素都有放射的特性，像鐳，鈾等元素，本身不甚穩定，所以是一個不完全的週期，可能在我們努力硏究之下，會有班新的發現—放射性元素（Radioac　tive　elements）旣曾放射氦核（Alphaparticle）而變成其他元素，一定也可能接受中子或其他質粒的衝而變成新的元素。</p>
<p>這一個理想，在戰時的科學界中，爲了戰爭迫切的需要，在努力的工作下已獲得了高度的成就：向來認爲不再可能的元素93Neptunium,94Plutomium,95Americium,96Curium都已發現，這就是所謂繼鈾元素（Transuranic　elemets）或稱超鈾元素，鈾後元素都司。</p>
<p>繼鈾元素的發現是化學界的一大進步，它是原子時代中劃時代的貢獻，同時，據科學界的權威預測，繼鈾元素司能會像稀土金屬一樣的，有十多個性質類似的元素形成一個行列，將週期表擴充推展到一百零幾位，但這些還有待於繼續的硏究。</p>
<p>關於這些元素，我們在報章雜誌上已數見不鮮，但是中文譯名各殊，使讀者易生誤解，頗感不便，因此，我們覺得中文譯名有統一釐定的必要。</p>
<p>其實，對於一個新元素的命名，化學界中木有三個傳統的規則：　每種元素（或其同位素）的第一個確定其有在的人有權給這種新元素定名，不必經過學兩機關的審定；　新元素的發現，不諭其爲自然界的發現或人造的同位素，應一律承認，無所歧視；　新元素的發現如有錯誤而被人否定，則其名命權應該讓給後來的正式發現者。</p>
<p>至於元素的中文譯名，本爲國立編譯館之專責，但常尚未正式訂定以前，學者專家如爲文獻上應用便利起見，也可擬譯，不過仍得注明原名以作參考，所以，近來對於新元素的發現，中文譯名已有各方的建議。像元素93之Neptunium，符號爲Np，質量爲二三九，譯名有鈮，錼，鎳等；元素94之Plutonium，符號爲Pu，質量也爲二三九，譯名有鈹，　，　，　等，其實，鈹，　均與現有元素相衝突，鈹是BeryHium　Be的標準譯名，　是稀土金屬中Praseodymium日日Pr的標準譯名，似都非所宜，比較妥善的是　，因Plutonium之名，源自冥王星，譯名稱　，比較合宜，不過，正式的譯名仍當待國立編譯館之確定。至於其他元素95之Americium，元素9698之Curium都因發現時日較短，化學性質尚無正確的報告，也無通用的譯名。</p>
<p>總之，譯名要求其確當，端賴科學家之共同檢討，集思廣益，當有補於將來正式之審定。</p>

<h3>電子顯微鏡</h3>
<p>— 明玉</p>
<p>人類的視官因爲新近有了一種超顯微鏡，而更加銳利起來了。這種超顯微鏡所能窺到「極微體」的秘奧，是前此科學家所夢想不到的。它利用了電子來代替普通一般的光綫。又利用了磁塲來代替折光玻璃。將向來所未見到過的一個世界，展現了出來。</p>
<p>現今的顯微鏡，大概分爲三種：最普通的一種，是用尋常的光錢來視察，使我們置身於另一個世界中，在那兒，物體至多可以放大到二千倍；另一種比較的我們不大熟習，用的是紫外光綫，紫外光錢極短，爲人目所不能見，它僅能在乾片上起作用，此類顯微鏡所攝成的影像，可較之原物擴大到五千倍；至於新式的電子顯微鏡，則所用的光綫更短，可以將物體放大至一萬倍以至三萬倍，而且像形淸晰。</p>
<p>有兩家大電氣公司，曾經或正在從事這一新機件的製造工作，一是德國的西門子公司，一是美國的RCA公司。</p>
<p>最初所製成的一架鏡機，足有房屋一角那麼大，但最新流綫型式的電子顯微鏡，則可以携帶出入於一般的房屋，而且價格公道，僅售九千五百美元。購買者大都是醫學，物理學，或化學實驗所，以及大學和工業機關等。用時祗要將尋常家用的電流接通即可。</p>
<p>科學家們對於新奇的發現，往往是不願隨便公佈的，然而他們在這一個新奇世界中所見到的稱種現象，却不時有三言兩語從實騐室裏洩漏出來。平日我們已經熟知的一些細菌，今後因可以得到更傎切的相片，即從來不曾上過鏡頭的，也可以攝取了。據稱腸窒扶斯菌生有波浪形的鞕毛，但無人能悉其作用；釀　菌被有連續　堅報的外膜，形成連銷式，百日咳細菌的內部構造極爲奇特。但此等發現，因所知有限，尚未能有裨實用。同樣情形，電子顯微鏡對於疾病的征服，在未來，一定是大有希望的。</p>
<p>工業界對於此項新發明，也非常注意，工塲裏面的科學家，　紛携带着他們要研究的標本，跑到RCA公司裏去，而在出發的時候，都非常高興，他們對於所窺見的標本，如合成紡織維等等的構造價相，咸驚異不置。據稱戰前德國的科學家們認爲此種新工具大可一用，他們亦已製有與此相類的顯微鏡了。德國水泥的製造法，是藉此改良的。後來他們又從事於硏究鑛穴的　　，這對於鑛工的衛生問題，大有關係。</p>
<p>電子顯微鏡在擴大人類眼界，窺視宇宙一點上，厥功甚偉，然而它並無什麼驚人的外貌，甚至還不及那二百吋的巴洛馬望遠鏡的外觀動人。它形如圓柱，安放桌上，高約六呎半，上有一些旋柄和指表。外形僅不過如是而已。內部有一根纖如毛髮的燈絲，安在圓柱的頂端。當電流經過這根燈絲的時候，便有電子流放射出來。燈絲直下有電位差存在，以加速電子流的下趨。再下爲磁塲，使電流折曲而聚成一焦點。圓柱的內部必需沒有一絲空氣，這樣方能使電子流通行無阻，所以要設計造一個空氣閘，以便標本放入而不至影響及其高度的傎空，這也是此鏡製造上一點巧妙之處。（未完）</p>

<h3>一·數字分節漢化之我見</h3>
<p>— 蔣庭基</p>
<p>讀本刋廿一期周賞民先生「數字分節的漢化」，使我於同感之餘，無任欣慰，蓋本人早於去年實行四位分節辦法。按採用標準式金額位綫，深覺四分位，適合國人習慣，其優點爲分位紀律化，認數淸晰，寫算便利，節省腦力。若我人盲從西式之三分位，猶用膳廢箸匙而用刀又，乃徒自苦耳。</p>
<p>金額分位錢，以前多仿用西式，而我國亦無明白規定，但目下金額數字龐大，支付多係天文數字，分位綫因之突增，且萬萬爲億，萬億爲兆，已於民三十三年正式規定，倘仍採仿西式，更非所宜。</p>
<p>譬如寫一三分位的數目，4，528，629，300.十人中恐有七八人，驟時啞口不能辦認其數。若用四分位寫作45e2862v9300，以e代億，v代萬，取其策劃簡易，音亦相同，便於記憶，如此一目了然，即可認其數爲四十五億二千八百六十二萬九千三百元。便利誰屬，不辯自明。彼西人之金額分位，旣不顧我人之認辨如何，則中國數字之分位，又何必顧及西人。况西人無「萬」，稱萬為十千，稱十萬爲百午，讓之甚感不便，中西數字之讀法旣不同如此，豈可捨已耘人，亦盲從</p>
<p>且觀交通方面，車行向　左進，亦可改為右進。乃會計方面之分位綫，豈不可廢去三分位，而改用四分位耶？甚盼各界逐漸採用四分位法，乃至普遍通行。西人往來，儘可依西人習慣，吾人自己計數，何不用固有辦法，亦猶之陰陽二層之同時用也。所望海內賢達，會計專家，多多參加意見並賜指敎。</p>
<p>鄧忻康</p>
<p>讀了本刋二十一期周實民先生的「數字分節的漢化」和二十三期孔繁淸先生對這問題的討論，我也來發表一些意見。</p>
<p>現在數字龐大，辨讀困難，爲明確起見，實有釐定的必要。大家都說西洋無萬位數，其實個十百千以上的「萬」字在英文爲Myriab如12340000英文可讀爲一千二百三十四Myriad，第九位至十二位是Million　3000,0000,0000英文可讀作三千Million。第十三位至十六位是Billion，十七位至二十位是Trillon，二十一位至二十四位是Ouadrillion,二十五位至二十八位是Ouintillion,讀法可以類推，本人向主用四位分法，並勸西人採用，但看優點訛屬，固無古今中外的分別。這不過是數字應用上便利不便利的間題，談不到國際標準化，更用不着「驚恐起來」！其實有些事情，我們不必跟外國人跑。</p>
<h3>鋼線錄音器</h3>
<p>— 鐘永</p>
<p>普通唱機唱了幾分鐘就要間斷一下，即使有自動換片的設備也不例外，而且臘製唱片易碎體積又大，有人就想應用另一種方法來補救這些缺點。</p>
<p>遠在一八九八年，丹麥科學家鮑爾生指出用磁化金屬造成的「痕跡」來錄音的理想；但他未能克服所遭的困難，因而廢棄了他的實驗。直到一九四二年，一個二十六歲的美國物理學家卡姆拉士才根據這前輩的啓示，實驗而得到成功。</p>
<p>卡氏研究的動機是他的表兄促成的，因爲卡氏的表兄是個歌唱家，想要錄下自己的聲音來硏究。五十年來磁學與電學的進步很可觀，卡氏就憑藉他在這方面的知識，完成了前人未完的工作。</p>
<p>卡氏在電磁鎭相隣的兩極間，用常速通過一條鋼銀，同時把聲音的波動轉換成電衝，通入電磁鐵的　圈，因而電磁鐵放出或多或少的磁力錢，鋼　也立即感受連續但强度變化的磁性，成爲許多極小的永久磁鐵，其極强各異但與原來的聲波相當，若要使聲音重現時，先把帶有「痕跡」的鋼　，放在電磁鐵磁極之間，以與記錄時相同的速度通過，　圈中就會發生脈動電流，加以放大後接上揚聲器，就能聽到和當初相同的聲音。</p>
<p>在最初幾次實驗中，卡氏發見當鋼　通過時，如果它本身扭轉或與錄音時的地位轉了個角度，那麼發出的聲曾也隨之變得歪曲刺耳而非原音。以後他將兩磁極移得很近很近，又在上劃了一條小槽，讓鋼產穿過再移動，聲音變歪的缺點也就給矯正了。這項改進，創造出一種新的錄昔器，能供八小時連續使用的它，只不過是一卷徑五吋厚十吋的細鋼　而已，你想，老式的唱機和唱片怎能不被淘汰而成古道？</p>
<p>鋼　錄音器在軍事方面用途極廣。例如：無綫電警戒站可用它錄下成萬的外國廣播，上前綫的部隊可帶它去記錄下整個戰事的聲音，民航機可拿它當飛行日誌，假使把它用石棉安置好，還可供萬一飛機發生意外後硏究失事原因的最好資料。目下奇異電氣公司以及許多廠家都在製造這種錄音器，卡氏也在和其他的科學家携手硏究，以推廣它的用途。</p>
<p>鋼銀錄音器平時用途之大，不下於輕便無綫電機。它能記錄任何聲音，從一段精采非凡的爵土音樂，到全部交響曲或歌劇，無論收音機旁，劇院之中，夜總會裏，音樂廳內都可記錄，演說，集會，審判乃至整個議會的議程莫不可以記錄在這一根纖長的鋼　上。</p>

<h3>木材漂白法</h3>
<p>— 劉遂生</p>
<p>漂自粉氣等漂白劑，廣用於漂白布理，紙張，早爲人所熟知；惟不適用於木材的漂白。家用木器以及裝飾品之用木料製成者，多非潔白，於是木材的漂白法，乃感需要。</p>
<p>漂白木材應用的藥料，配方如次：</p>
<p>矽酸鈉（俗名水玻璃）　一六分</p>
<p>過硼酸鈉　一·五分</p>
<p>將上兩種藥料，混和溶於沸水中，即可備用。漂白木材時，祗將毛刷沾此漂白液，抹刷於欲漂白的木材面上靜置半小時後，拭去藥液，並用水洗學。待其自乾後，磨光便得。</p>
<p>按此種藥液，漂白力量很强，若經兩次　抹，可使木材由骨骼之色，一變而爲象牙白；即使灰黑色之木材如胡桃木者，用此液漂自，亦可有效。</p>
<p>附註：　　水玻璃係灰白色塊狀或粉末之物質，能溶於水中。分子式爲Na2SiO3，係由砂（二氧化矽）溶於苛性鈉溶液中而成。</p>
<p>過硼酸鈉係白色晶形有鹹味之物質，能溶於水中。分子式爲NaBO3.H2O或NaBO3.4H2O。製法有混和硼砂，過氧化鈉，雙氣水液加熟使其結晶，或用硼酸與過氧化鈉傾於冷酸性水中而成。</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 黃寶瑞</p>
<p>我們都知道夢是一件極平凡的事，一個人雖然不是夜夜有夢，可是人總該有過夢的經驗，同時也因為夢是變幻多端的，所人夢在人的腦海裏，總漂浮著一種神秘的感覺，也給人們一種錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>有的人一定要問，爲什麼要做夢呢？</p>
<p>要解決這個問題，我們首先要明白夢和我們人的願望和經驗是有着密切的關係的；因爲人的願望是沒有止境的，而這些願留在個體發展的各個階段中各不相同，在整個個體發展中有的是能滿足的，有的是不能滿足的，至於那些不能滿足的願望，都被抑制在潛意識中，但這些被抑壓的願望並不容易消減，仍然在潛意識中繼續活動著，也時常和意識起衝突，如果前者的勢力超過後者的時候，不但會發生過失，笑話，幻境，夢境等，有時還會使人格趨於破產，當睡眠的時候，這種意識抑制的抗力就减少，由是潛意識裏的願望勢力增加，便開始活動，所以那些潛藏的經騐和願望就流入意識界中，因此便右夢的產生。</p>
<p>有的人間我：「爲什麼把兩手　住胸部就會有惡夢呢？肚子餓的時侯就會夢吃呢？」這問題雖然有硏究的價値，但帶給人們一種錯誤的觀念，因爲大家居然認爲這種刺激是夢的起源，其實不然，胸部受壓力和肚子餓不過是補充夢的數量罷了，心理學家把這種刺激分為兩類：　是外界刺激，　是內部的刺激。</p>
<p>外界的剌激</p>
<p>觸覺——夢和觸覺所受的刺激各有不同；如夢有人壓住胸部，即自己的手壓下胸部或棉被大量的緣故，在弗羅意得（Freud）釋夢上曾加證明。有人夜問夢被法官宣告他的死刑，即他的衣領過於縛緊，有人夜夢和一位少女同床，即他的兩腿夾着自己的手……。</p>
<p>視覺——在睡眠的時候如有光綫刺激眼簾的時候，也會把夢境　變，我有一位朋友，夜問夢他的新房屋失火，一時不及撲滅，火熖冲天，當驚醒時看見他的老母點着燭火在找東西；我有一次夢我的飛機墮落在冰山上，驚醒時發現日光照着我的面部。</p>
<p>聽覺——假如有外界的聲音刺激聽覺時也會轉移夢境。如古今圖書集成　夢部有虛有則夢看擊鼓，一醒時只見小弟戲叩門爲鼓聲，有人夜問夢見某公司失盜，一時驚鐘亂鳴，被擾驚配，原來是禮拜堂的鐘聲。</p>
<p>內部的刺激</p>
<p>這種情形在我國的古書上多有記載，如素問服要精微篇上載稱：「陰盛則夢涉大水而恐懼，陽盛則夢大火而燔灼，陰陽俱盛則夢相殺毀傷，……」又如「甚飽則予，甚飢則取」等等，大家都能了解的。又如將罹熱病的人，夜夢怪物襲侵；將生半身麻木症的人，夜夢被人剖爲兩半等，都是由內部的刺激而起的，不過要記着，這些並不是夢的起源。</p>
<p>其次，我們常常看到許多爲了夜夜有夢而憂慮的人，他們到處求聲求卜，以爲這是體格不好，或神經衰弱的象徵，這種觀念是錯誤的。我們要知遠夢不是體質的現象，乃是心理的現象，也就是說夢是個人的過去經騐的刺激所作的解釋，對刺激所發的反應，所以不　是胖子瘦子，身體健康的與病態的，都難免有夢。</p>
<p>最後，我要伸述的，夢對於我們的貢獻和益處是很大的。</p>
<p>在前面已經說過，人們願　是無法滿足的，而那些不能滿足的願望，部被抑制在潛意識內，這種控制願望的意識，弗羅意得呌做「自心的監督」，（Endopsychicor），在白天道種抗力大都能抑制着下意識的願望，一到睡眼時，這種抗力减少，下意識的願望勢力增大，便開始在意識界山大津活動，這時眠者有睡眠的願望，所以這兩種願望互相衝突，在這時如果沒有夢的現象，一個人的睡眠便會受到影響，身心便受到威脅，（可以把失眠拿來做參考）因此就有夢的產生，來避免這兩種的衝突，夢不但來保護你的睡眠，同時還會間接地來滿足我們的願望。現在我們就該知道夢是怎麼一回事。說到這裏，應該可以改正人們對夢的預兆的觀念了。</p>
<p>爲了便於關者對夢有着一個概念起見，此將所述夢的大要，列成一個簡表如左：</p>
<p>起源——爲願望的望求，</p>
<p>內容——爲願望的滿足。</p>
<p>形式——爲幻覺的經騐，</p>
<p>功用——爲睡眠的保安。</p>

<h3>綢繆論</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>前幾天西伯利亞寒流猛烈向上海方面襲擊，北風吹得特別屬害，把寒舍屋頂上的洋鉛皮吹得拍拍響，抽荆同我說，幸虧沒有下雨，否則我家又要漏水了。說起屋漏，質是一件傷心的事，這一所房子儘管每年修理，除了有心理上的保障作用之外，等於沒有修理一樣。每年在　雨季節，大漏一次，當然囉，「屋破又遭連夜雨」是常道，所以弄得徹夜無寐是照例應受的磨難。怨憤之餘，等天晴後，立即招喚鉛皮匠來修理。說也奇怪，修理好之後，　雨已過，天氣久晴，上面旣不掉落雨水，漏之修好與否，也無從得知，經過半年來的風吹日曬，鉛皮又不受洋釘的束縛，「乘時崛起」，結果到次年的霉季，還不是大漏一塲？</p>
<p>所以今年北風狂吹，洋鉛皮預示漏水的信號之後，我想非要遵照朱子家訓的話不可，「宜未雨而綢繆」，預先要請敎鉛皮匠來修補檢查一下。亂世佳人的女主角史嘉萊，在歷刧情塲，頻遭世變的風塵中淸醒過來，絇爛歸於平淡，想回到故鄉去度其靑靜的田園生活，惟一的顯望便是有一所不漏水的屋子。不漏水的房屋巳成爲人生的願望之一，亦足見世界上漏水房屋之多了。</p>
<p>其實屋子漏水還是小事，其所「波」及者僅是一室，若是黃河泛濫，那便不堪設想了。　舍蕩然，居民漂流，跟蹤而來的還有饑饉，疾病，寒冷，以至於死亡。所以歷來治黃者的理論，不出二途，上策治本，主疏導；下策治標，主固堤。當然疏導要比國堤好，是屬於未雨綢繆的積極措置。至於固堤，大水還是常要把防綫衝成窟窿，一湧而入的。黃患之年必修堤，與寒舍之年必修理鉛皮，如出一轍。</p>
<p>因此，我主張防患未然，必須用疏導的方法。剷除汙塞，緩衝激流，使衆流成渠，納諸大海。這是「綢繆諭」中的最上乘方法。一切人爲的糾紛，事前早用疏導的方法，則提壩不固而自固，可以减少許多新聞紙上驚心怵目的不幸事件於無形矣。</p>
<h3>無名英雄</h3>
<p>— 希禮</p>
<p>在法國淪陷期間，除掉少數聞名的抗戰英雄之外，還有着許多無名英雄——男人，女人，甚至於小孩，他們都自願受苦或且冒死去帮助他們的盟軍。下述的故事，充分地顯出了他們的勇敢精前。</p>
<p>在一九四四年某一天的淸晨，一架英國的戰鬥機，在諾曼第的上空不幸而被擊中，那位飛行員就乘着降落傘安全地降到了地上，他把戴在頭上的一頂帽子拋去，並且穿上雨衣，將內曆所穿的軍裝完全遮住，他又改用法國語與人談話，這樣籃單的喬裝，就使他可以冒充一個當地的居民了。忽然，他記起一個地方，倘遇不幸的時候，在那邊是可以暫時躱避一下的，於是，他走進一個市鎭，乘上了火軍。車廂中已經坐滿不少的法國人，他就擴在他們中間坐了下來。當查票員查過了他的車票之後，他滿以爲自己己是脫齜險境，可是，不一會兒，一個警察走了進來，他是來檢查每個乘客的身份證的，而這飛行員所有唯一的證明書，祇能證實他是一個皇家空軍罷了。</p>
<p>警察將那與衆不同的文件看了又看，良久，終於發問了：「這是什麼？」</p>
<p>「我的身份證。」</p>
<p>「你是一個飛行員嗎？」</p>
<p>「是。」</p>
<p>「你是在皇家空軍中服務的嗎？」</p>
<p>「是」</p>
<p>「你在這裏幹什麼？」</p>
<p>「我是被擊落在這兒的……我想脫離選兒。」</p>
<p>那位吃驚的警察喊了起來：「但是，先生，你要知道像這樣的文件是不能通行的啊！你要遇到麻煩了。」</p>
<p>這飛行員無可奈何地聲一聳肩。剛才在這車廂中的乘客們都安葬我已故的姊夫的，他的身材　跟你差不多，我把他留下的衣服給代之，這樣你可以得到不少便利呢。」</p>
<p>另一個已有白鬚的老者說道：「你是一個軍官，而我是一個退職的軍官，當然我來保護你，你還是到我家裏去罷。」</p>
<p>車廂中一陣喧鬧，在爭着「我帮你這樣做。我替你……」總之，每一個人都想遏住別人的聲音，而提出他自己的賈獻去帮助這飛行員，連那位警察也不甘落後地獻出了他的忠告。</p>
<p>雖然在這車廂中可能有一二德國的情報員或特務，使他們因助敵的罪名而被處死刑，但是他們全都不願。</p>
<p>火軍到了目的地，乘客們擁着飛行員，走出車廂來，那警察首先走了下去，對車站上一個正在檢查旅客的法國憲兵說：「那個不戴帽子的人是我的朋友，請你放他過去。」這位飛行員被別的旅客們聞着，安全地走出了軍站。</p>
<p>兩星期之後，他已平安地回到了倫敦。</p>
<p>英倫一大報　毛毅　英國報業大王皮佛布洛克所辦的「每日快報」（Daily　Exlmess）日銷近四百萬份，是英國數一數二的大報。　「每日快報」的館址設在倫敦的弗里脫街，裏面是不分畫夜的忙碌着。一層樓是印刷房，機器的鬧聲澈夜喧囂。戰前報紙每天出二十四頁，每晚有四百噸白紙在這裹被印上黑字。戰時及戰後，由於紙張節約的關係，報紙的張數已緊縮爲六頁，但是，因爲銷數的增加，「每日快報」每天所用的紙量尚需一百三十噸。</p>
<p>二層樓是編輯部，這裏有十二架電報收信機，一天到晚的滴答不已。從早晨八點半起，就有抄寫員來將電報謄錄下來，他將電報分爲三大類：國際新開，國內新聞和體育新聞，然後再分別交給各主管編輯。各部門的編輯室的規模亦不算小，單以國際新聞編輯室而言，就設有寫字檯十隻，僅祗根據國別而將電訊分類，就由一個人專門管理。</p>
<p>編輯部每日舉行會議兩次，由總編輯主持。第一次在中午召開，第二次在下午五點半召開，所討論的不外是檢討過去和處理新聞的工作的分配與態度。</p>
<p>第二次會讓完畢後，助理編輯就要開始工作了。他們每天實足工作八小時——從下午六點起至翌晨兩點止。不過，他們不像我國編輯那樣的每週工作七天，而是每週有兩天而以輸流休息的</p>
<p>「每日快報」在曼却斯特和格拉斯哥兩大都市都設有分館，兩分館與總館之間架有專用電報錢，電訊往返毫不稽延，每日收發的字數達三四萬之多。</p>
<p>「每日快報」的電話問亦極忙碌。十七個接錢生從淸晨五時起就開始工作，平日電話進出約有三千次，就是假日也有一千次電話進出。</p>
<p>在倫敦總館內設有三個茶水供應處，全日流輪開放，爲了替全館三千兩百多名職工解過，每天所消費的茶葉達十九磅半之多</p>
<h3>幼稚論調</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>時至今日，偉論高調亦云夥矣，然大都自說自話，或陳言舊套，極無道理。我覺得還是小孩子的話有時却有頗足可喜者。此在做父母的尤有這種感覺。華爾脫，文契爾有一句話：「在你母親的心目中，你是不會有錯事的，因爲她無時不在以心來觀察你。」爰記意言數則於下——</p>
<p>一個三歲的女孩子在洗澡的時候，看見她的手掌有縐紋。她說道：「媽媽，你看我的手是何等憂愁呀！」</p>
<p>敎師察君幼年級的學生時，發見一個小學生名呌喜兒的手最　，他對學生們說：「如果你們能指出另一隻手比喜兒的手還要　，我可以不責罰他。」</p>
<p>敎室裏沒有一人作聲，最後還是喜兒自己輕輕說道：「先生，請你看看我的另一隻手吧。」</p>
<p>四歲的姪女本來是在和二個友伴玩雪的，突然離開了他們，奔向我來，看來是快要哭了。</p>
<p>我問她道：「賓賓，什麼事啊？」</p>
<p>她啜泣着說道：「我的男朋友唐哥不喜歡我了。」</p>
<p>我勸慰她道：「你爲什麼這樣說呢？唐哥當然喜歡你。你們玩的時候，我是在看着你們，你們好像玩得很是起勁呢。」</p>
<p>「不，我什麼看不出來！他把雪向新來的女孩子拋的時候多，向我拋的時候少！」</p>
<p>一個男孩剛學了些天文知識，到了晚上便想把他的天文學傳授給他的妹妹。</p>
<p>他嚴肅地問他妹妹道：「你看見天上那一小點星兒嗎？那一顆小星要比地球大得多呢。」</p>
<p>他的妹妹不相信他的話，反詰道：「那末爲什她擋不住雨呢？」</p>
<p>一個孩子畫了一隻馬給他的母親看。母親說：「可是這隻馬爲什麼會有五隻脚的呢？</p>
<p>小孩解釋道：「我給牠五隻脚，以防其中一隻折斷時之用。」</p>
<h3>上帝與老繭</h3>
<p>— 銅</p>
<p>一個十六歲的女孩子躺着要死下來。她是在一個孤苦無依，沒有母親的大家庭中居於長姊地位。她負了一家重祖渡過童年，因爲辛勞過度，染有肺病，即將死亡。有一個探病者問她有否受過流禮，進過敎堂？她回答說，「沒有」。</p>
<p>探病者說：「那末你魂歸天國之後，把什麼去告訴上帝呢？」</p>
<p>那孩子伸出一雙瘦弱而薄得幾乎透明的手，手上因不斷工作滿長老繭，說道，「我把一雙手送給上帝看吧！」</p>
<h3>牙醫烏</h3>
<p>— 駝</p>
<p>非洲鱷魚如其發生牙病，要找一個牙醫師非常之便利。事實上牠所要表示的只要把嘴張開。一隻生長在尼羅河畔的牙醫島，看到這個「痛苦信號」，立刻會飛來職治。這島的大小像麻雀一般，看到鱷魚永久張開着嘴像打呵欠一般，就鑽到多窩洞的鱷魚嘴要來工作。牙醫鳥的醫治工作包括啄去水蛭和別的附着在齒縫中，舌底，和口腔凹窩處的寄生蟲。</p>
<p>要醫費嗎？不管鱷魚怎樣野蠻，牠們之間有一個君子協定，就是在醫治過程中，不能把小烏一口吞掉。</p>

<p>渚　和雲卿用過午飯後，　齊上銀行辦公，雲卿逕來至風笙家裏，見她穿一條棉袍，滿身油膩，腰間圍一塊白布關裙，剛從廚房出來笑道：「大嫂你傎忙！」鳳笙道：「這有什麼法子，老媽燒的菜，渚齊吃不下，我不動手，他一天飯就不用吃了。」雲卿一聽，心裏暗自一　，她對渚齊是知何忠誠，我此來挑撥她，破敗她的良緣，於心傎是有愧！鳳笙把雲卿請到屋內，倒茶讓坐，口裹絮絮地把家常用度，米多少錢，煤多少錢，說個不了，雲卿那有心情聽她，祇暗自盤算，此來計劃，說不說呢？說了很傷她的心，不說又失了機會，平日很有把握的，今天居然心裏亂難，鳳笙說了許多話，一句也沒聽到耳裏。後來鳳笙請敎她，要打一隻金別針，需要多少錢，她含含糊糊，不知她間的是什麼，祇點頭連說：「是，是。」鳳笙見她神不相屬，對她祇是發怔，並不似平日那樣議諭風生，問道：「大姊，你今天怎麼，是有病嗎？」雲卿給他一問，方才驚覺，眉頭縐一縐，欲說又止。鳳笙道：「你是很忠厚的人，男人都是很薄情的，我說了你可不要生氣。」鳳笙道：「大姊，你一定又聽到渚齊在外面說我什麼，請你告訴我好了，我不會生氣的。」雲卿暗忖，我若慢慢對她說，她腦筋不清楚，會　夾不清，不如直捷痛快告訴她，渚齊要和她離婚，看她如何。想定主意，眉頭一縐道：「這話我不應該告訴你，我氣不過才來告訴你，渚齊決定要和你離婚！」鳳笙聽了這句話，好似觸電一般，張　兩隻大眼睛，怔住了一句話也說不出，呆了好一會，才哇了一聲，伏在桌上大哭起來。雲卿心情過去連說帶勸，呌她不要哭。鳳笙連哭帶喊道：「怎麼好！怎麼好！他不要我了，我早就知道，有這麼一天！我完了，我完了！」雲卿道：「你別哭呀，事情不是這麼簡單，我今天來，就為抱不平，來和你商量這事，我是對你表同情，就是渚齊不要你，你也不能隨隨便便答應他。」</p>
<h3>回敎徒不吃猪肉的原故</h3>
<p>— 伍特公</p>
<p>回敎自唐代傳入我國，已有一千三百餘年的歷史。回敎徒所以不吃猪肉，不過是回敎禮俗上的一小端，並無多大的神秘，而値得受非回敎徒的重視。譬加廣東人以蛇貓爲美味之「龍虎湯」，又喜吃鼠，而長東人對於外省人不吃這三物，並不認爲一件奇事，妄作稱種猜測。</p>
<p>然而回敎徒不吃豬肉，常有許多人龍爲怪事，而發種種不入耳之談。其實回敎徒所以絕對堅守此戒，祇因爲他們虔誠遵守回敎古一關經中的諭言而已。茲將古蘭經中關於回敎徒的禁貪之文，譯錄如下，以明究克。</p>
<p>古蘭經曰，「告爾衆信徒。可吃我所供你們的佳品，並常感謝安拉（阿拉伯人稱呼傎主之名），假使你們敬拜他。他祗禁吃自死物（按魚不在內），血液，猪肉，不誦安拉之名而誦他名所宰的牲畜。但任何人倘爲必要所迫，而非出於本意，且吃不過度，（按此乃言倘爲飢餓所迫，無他物可吃，亦可稍食以上的築品），不加罪於他，因爲安拉是至恕至慈的。」（第二章第一七二和一七三節）</p>
<p>在上引兩節論言降以前，安拉曾以和上約略相同的諭言降示穆罕默德曰：「你說：「對於食者的禁品，據我所受的啓示，不外乎自死物，或外溢的的血液，或猪肉因爲確屬不潔，——或違法不誦安拉之名所宰的性畜……』」（第六章第一四六節）</p>
<p>安拉最後又降諭言曰：「對你們列爲禁品的是：自死物，血液，不誦安拉之名而誦他名所宰的牲畜；動物被窒息，或被重擊，或被念摔，或被觸撞而死者；以及被野獸噬及一部分，除非你們能依禮式宰殺者；（按此言此類動物倘血未凝結仍可依禮式宰而食之。）在石壞所宰者，（按此乃指阿拉伯人在特置之石壇上所宰專供祭神用的性畜。）並禁吃抽籤分得的肉食；（按此因近於賭博性質，故不吃。）食此爲違法。」（第五章第三節）</p>
<p>古蘭經關於回敎徒的食禁，已盡於上文。由此可知回敎徒不但不吃猪肉，即未經誦安拉之名而宰的牛羊等畜，自死或受傷而未經正式宰殺的動物，有損道德的肉食，亦都不吃。至於不吃猪肉的原故，經中曾特別示明乃因此物不潔，且列在自死物和血液之下，示明和此二物相類。所以回敎徒不吃肉，不過爲回敎禮俗上的一小端，除了遵守經諭，注重衛生以外，並無其他原因，甚至在絕食之時，還可以稍爲吃些。至所以平日絕對不嘗者，實再，不吃猪肉，並非回敎獨創的禁例。據上古史言：埃及的祭司貴族早已不吃此物，亦因爲它不潔的原故。猶太敎亦不吃猪肉，舊約串命記第一四章第八節曰：「猪雖分蹄，而不反　，亦不潔，其肉勿食，其尸捫」，利未記第一一章第七第八節亦有同樣之文。新約四福音書中言及動物之文，亦可證明耶穌同視豬爲不潔之畜。我國非回敎徒雖喜吃猪肉，但本早經疏在豕類下所採錄的各醫家之說，莫不認猪肉為有害。（文長不能援引）近代科學昌明，更發見豬肉中含有不同的腐菌十餘種，最有害的是：細如髮絲的旋毛蟲，能致若干種病症。所以回敎徒絕對不吃豬肉，正足表示他們絕對注重衛生，毫無神奇之可言</p>
<p>筆者厠身報界己久，且爲回敎信徒，故秉公執言，草此拙文，貢獻大眾，當此大局動盪之際，非回敎徒和回敎徒尤當同舟共濟，互相愛護，所以不但對於回敎徒不吃猪肉一事，凡是關於回敎的種種失實之言如「左手執經右手持劍」之類，都應戒絕，這是筆都所懇香以祝的。</p>
<h3>談獎學金</h3>
<p>— 仲明</p>
<p>本市獎學金統一委員會業己決定下學期的獎金總額增至一百五十億元，公立大學學生的獎金爲一百五十萬至三百萬元，私立大學學生的獎金爲三百萬至四百五十萬元。在這物價高漲的今天，這個數目雖然不很大，但對於一般淸寒的同學仍舊起着興奮的作用，同時就社會人士給予淸寒學生的鼓勵的意義而言，也實有無限的價値。</p>
<p>獎學金予淸寒學生之希望及其所含之社會意義旣如此，那麼，學校當局和統一委員會審核該項獎金的名額和金額的時候，自應加以精確的審查和縝密的考核。關於具體的審查標準和方法，各學校和統一委員會當早己有所規定，但是舉金分配之是否合理化，恐怕還有不能盡如我們理想的地方。</p>
<p>譬如說，各學校過去是以成績作爲審核標準的，聽說成績在七十五分以上者才可以僅得少額的獎金，在八十分以上才可以獲得較多數額的獎金。這樣，淸寒的同學是處於比較不利的地位的。因爲淸寒的同學們平日多有以投稿兼職等各種方式爭取一點錢來作爲繳納膳費之用者，不得不移轉一些賽貴的時間於譚業之外，在這種情形之下，則其成績之略差於飽食無憂的同學，自屬一種極可寬恕的事實。而當審核獎金的時候，如果僅僅爲了一二分的差別，傎正淸寒的同學竟至得不到獎金，或者祇得到少額的獎金，而享到實惠的却是許多可以溫飽甚或頗爲富裕的同學，這該見多麼不公平不合理的現象呢？</p>
<p>獎學金的設置假使祇是爲獎學而獎學，那末以成績作爲審核的標準原無可厚非，然而假使於獎學之餘，還帶有培養淸寒學生不因經濟困難而輟學的意義，則同一成績而經濟情形相差懸殊的學生，自不能同其待遇。各學校在審核獎金之時，除成績作爲一種當然的參考以外，對於各個申請學生的淸塞「程度」，也理應加以合理的配合。與其把寳貴的獎金貼補豐衣足食的學生作爲添製新裝或玩喝之用，無寗救濟成績相差甚微而爲繳不出膳費蹙眉發愁的同學。也惟有道樣，獎學金才保持了原有的意義。</p>

<h3>Kowloon City Refugees Have Nowhere to Go; Hong Kong Government Forces Eviction Again; Guangzhou Circles to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] In the capital, there has been little development regarding the Shameen Incident on the 18th. The British Embassy has also not lodged any protest with us regarding this incident, awaiting instructions from the British government. It is understood that regarding the Kowloon City issue, representatives from both sides in London have been in constant contact for the past four days, and reports have been sent to the capital frequently. As for the Shameen Incident, both sides have remained silent. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a clear understanding of the entire incident but has not yet received detailed instructions or reports on the interrogation of the arrested perpetrators.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] In light of the unfortunate incidents caused by student and public demonstrations in Guangzhou, the Ministry of Education issued a circular on the 17th to education bureaus in all provinces and cities, and all colleges and universities across the country, to explain the progress of negotiations regarding the Kowloon City incident. It is hoped that all bureau chiefs and school principals will earnestly persuade students to remain calm and await a reasonable solution from the government, and that they will refrain from any excessive actions that could be exploited by evildoers, thereby exacerbating diplomatic difficulties.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] The Hong Kong side recently issued another order, demanding that all refugees stranded in Kowloon City be evacuated by the 19th. This has once again triggered a surge of reaction in this area. The Kowloon City Incident Relief Association, organized by various sectors, held its third meeting on the 18th and decided to wait for a report on the Kowloon City situation on the 19th, then hold a general meeting on the 20th to take countermeasures. According to the heads of the local machine workers' union and the seamen's union, if the situation in Kowloon City deteriorates, a large-scale strike will be launched immediately. The seamen's union also announced that it could immediately cease all work within half an hour, resulting in the suspension of all ferry services between Guangdong and Hong Kong, and goods would be unable to be unloaded. It is anticipated that Hong Kong seamen will also take the same action. Also, although today is Sunday, the leaders of the province and city have been working all day to handle the Shameen Incident. More than 140 suspects have been arrested and have begun interrogation. Martial law has been lifted in Shameen, but it is still heavily guarded by military police. It is feared that the situation may worsen again due to the Hong Kong side's forced eviction of Kowloon City residents.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 18th] The Chinese national flag continues to fly today in the old city area of Kowloon. Evicted residents have built many small tents for shelter and established two military-use tent areas as their headquarters and to store food. The police have not interfered and do not intend to interfere. Currently, only one Chinese passenger ship and two cargo ships are operating in the Pearl River. Taikoo ships suspended operations after the Guangzhou incident, but the Hong Kong Airlines Guangzhou flights are still operating as scheduled.</p>
<p>[Our Dongqing Dispatch, 18th] The Chongqing Police Department today notified all consulates that foreigners are strictly prohibited from going out if students march to protest the Kowloon City incident, to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Students March to Protect Rights, Calling for Internal Stability and External Resistance to Aggression</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 18th] More than 200 representatives from China University, National College of Physical Education, Provincial Agricultural College, and various middle schools in this area marched in three trucks at 10:00 AM on the 18th to protest the Kowloon City incident. They first broadcast propaganda in the Wuchang urban area, shouting slogans such as "Seek internal stability, resist external aggression." At 1:30 PM, they crossed the river and marched with five trucks in the downtown area of Hankou, maintaining good order. The military and police authorities also sent personnel to protect British-owned companies and the British Consulate. At 3:30 PM, the representatives visited Director Cheng to present their petitions, and at 4:00 PM, they met with reporters to explain the reasons for requesting the government to recover Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hankou, 18th] More than 300 students in this area held an anti-British demonstration this afternoon but were unable to reach their destination—the British Consulate. Plainclothes officers guarded the consulate all day. When the student contingent arrived at the Yangtze River port from Wuchang at 2:00 PM this afternoon, they were turned back by the police.</p>
<p>British and American consulate personnel watched from the rooftops and were later persuaded by the police to go inside to avoid provoking public anger.</p>
<p>British Consul Stocks stayed in the consulate all day, but the British flag was not hoisted on the consulate's roof. The atmosphere in the city is still calm, as the police department learned of the students' plans to march today and immediately took necessary measures to prevent a repeat of the Guangzhou tragedy.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 18th] The Jiangsu College and Middle School Federation in this city today resolved to telegraph the government, urging it to resist Britain strongly and recover Hong Kong and Kowloon.</p>
<h3>Statement by Guangzhou Student Union Council Member on the Shameen Incident</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Qu Changcheng, Standing Director and Secretary of the City Student Union, made the following comments on the burning of the British Consulate on the 18th: "The Union led students from various schools to participate in the city's demonstration marches, purely out of patriotic enthusiasm. It is regrettable that the burning of the British Consulate occurred on that day. Afterwards, some people in the community mistakenly believed that it was done by the students, which was due to a lack of understanding of the facts. An investigation found that the students participating in the march announced the dispersal of the team after arriving at Shameen and shouting slogans, and students from various schools also left one after another. The burning was actually arson committed by conspirators taking advantage of the crowd's anger. At that time, Standing Director Li Naiwan and I were mostly on the scene persuading students to disperse and maintaining order, and protecting British residents such as Mr. Williams to return to the consulate. Most of the arrested students were maintaining order on the scene and were mistakenly arrested. Many have been interrogated and released in recent days. For those who have not yet been interrogated, I am determined to go to various security agencies on the 19th to request bail. Regarding the Kowloon incident, we will continue to maintain our previous attitude and vow to be the government's backing, striving for a reasonable resolution of this matter."</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Report on Shameen Incident, Only Facts, No Comments</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th] All London newspapers today carried reports of the Guangzhou unrest, but without comment. The reports presented the course of events in a very objective manner, and especially mentioned the origin of the dispute. Most newspapers mentioned the efforts made by the National Government to stop the unrest, and Premier Zhang Qun's order to Guangdong provincial government officials to take measures to prevent the continued occurrence of anti-British demonstrations. The Times also reported in detail the views of our officials stationed in London on this incident. They expressed regret over the occurrence of the incident and said that the Chinese government had repeatedly urged the Hong Kong government to handle the issue of Chinese residents in Kowloon City with tact and restraint, fearing that any strong actions by Britain might be used by certain extremist elements as an excuse to incite anti-British and anti-government unrest. The British Foreign Office invited our ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tiansi, to discuss the matter last night, and Zheng expressed the same view.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Prepares for Legislative Yuan Elections; Jiangxi Election Office Requests Flexible Handling of Legislative Yuan Ballot Book Delivery Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Qianjiang Dispatch, 18th] The Zhenjiang Legislative Yuan election is scheduled to be held simultaneously in various townships on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. The 163 members of the Zhenjiang County Reporters Association are designated to vote in Shuangjing Township. According to general estimates, Chen Guangfu is the most promising candidate for the Zhenjiang County Legislative Yuan election.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the issue of delivering Legislative Yuan ballot books, the Jiangxi Provincial Election Office reported to the General Election Office here that it had adopted an expedient handling method and requested approval for record-keeping. It is claimed that the ballot books are actually replaced by voter lists, and the voter lists for the Legislative Yuan election in counties and cities are originally based on the National Assembly representative voter lists. If, after being replaced by the ballot books, they must be delivered to the district election office, then the counties and cities will not even have a basis for the National Assembly representative voter lists. If the district election office sends voter lists to various counties and cities to replace the ballot books, it will not only be difficult to mail back and forth, but also time will not allow it. It is now specifically stipulated that the Legislative Yuan election ballot books will be allowed to be replaced by the voter lists originally stored in the counties and cities, which will still be kept by the counties and cities. However, after the voting is completed, the counties and cities must, in accordance with regulations, separately list the matters that should be recorded on the ballot books and report them to the district election office for verification as a remedy. This is reported for your inspection and record-keeping. The General Election Office's 18th Election Committee resolved yesterday to approve the record-keeping.</p>
<h3>Elected National Assembly Representatives Sign, Firmly Oppose Paired Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Kuomintang National Assembly Representatives Signing and Nominating Elected Candidates Friendship Association held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th to continue discussing the issue of party members withdrawing their candidacies. The following important resolutions were passed: To safeguard the constitution, thoroughly oppose the undemocratic bad example of paired elections, and swear not to rest until the candidate with the most votes is elected; representatives from all regions will gather in the capital before March 19th; strengthen the voters' movement to protect the constitution; if the right to vote and be elected is deprived, then the people may not fulfill their obligations; send representatives to request the General Election Office to deliver the certificates of election to the elected candidates in person; issue a third declaration; Member Zhang Xiubai's elected status was illegally revoked by the Chongming Election Office. In addition to the individual filing a lawsuit according to law, the Association will also protest to the General Election Office and the Provincial Election Office.</p>
<h3>First National Assembly Representative Election; Voter Statistics for Vocational Groups; Total Reaches Over 4.7 Million</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to statistics from national vocational women's elections, during the first National Assembly representative elections held in our country in November last year, the total number of vocational group voters who participated in the voting was 4,719,440, including: fisheries 411,170, railway workers' union 105,075, seamen's union 138,650, salt workers' union 247,250, mining workers' union 215,594, highway workers' union 412,863, telecommunications workers' union 12,595, commercial groups 2,097,990, industrial and mining groups 182,033, education associations 990,071, education groups 15,303, journalists' associations 28,316, lawyers' associations 5,941, agricultural technicians 1,004, civil engineers 5,113, mechanical engineers 306, electrical engineers 257, chemical engineers 204, textile engineers 55, mining engineers 587, accountants' associations 1,055, Chinese medicine practitioners' associations 91,124, doctors' associations 211,422, midwives and nurses' associations 1,972, teacher (student) associations 1,919.</p>
<h3>Amendment to Article 4 of the Measures for the Collection and Manufacturing of Gold</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The National Government: Article 4 of the Measures for the Collection and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry by Silver Shops has been approved by the National Government after being submitted by the Ministry of Finance, and has been filed for record. The following is the amended article:</p>
<p>Amended Article 4 of the Measures for the Collection and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry by Silver Shops: The price of gold jewelry sold by silver shops shall be based on the gold price announced by the Central Bank, plus an operating fee of 40% and a legal profit of 20%. The additional labor cost may be determined by the local trade association based on the fineness of the gold jewelry work and reported to the local competent authority for approval. Gold jewelry collected may be given a labor cost in addition to the listed price, based on the fineness of the processing, with reference to the amount of labor costs approved by the local government for the sale of gold jewelry.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement Postponed to February 1st</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] It is understood that the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement, originally scheduled to be implemented on the 20th, may be postponed to February 1st due to the lack of preparation. Our customs will send a large number of customs officers to Hong Kong to assist in the inspection of all ships entering the country from Hong Kong. Ding Guitang has also gone to Hong Kong from Taiwan to preside over the implementation of the agreement.</p>
<h3>Premier Zhang to Seek Solutions to Northern Economic Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The North China Petition Delegation, in addition to participating in the public memorial ceremony for the late Government Commissioner Zhang Ji on the 18th, also visited Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren, Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng, Ambassador Situ, Advisor Fu Jingbo, and other Northerners. They all expressed concern about the overall situation in North China and expressed sympathy and support for the points of the petition. Each petition representative is scheduled to meet with National Government Secretary-General Wu Dingchang at 11:00 AM on the 19th to state their case. In the afternoon, they will attend a banquet hosted by Central Bank President Zhang Jia'ao to further discuss issues such as the purchase and transportation of cotton and grain, re-export, foreign exchange, and industrial and commercial loans. If time permits, they also plan to visit the Joint Treasury and the Ministry of Finance to discuss related matters. In the afternoon of the 20th, they will again consult with the Ministry of Food on various specific issues. It is reliably learned that Premier Zhang Qun is very concerned about the North and will convene relevant institutions such as economy, finance, food, and finance, as well as petition representatives, in the near future to hold extensive consultations in order to have a comprehensive and feasible solution to the severe economic situation in the North.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Agrees to Loan to Aid Yunnan Province Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 18th] In order to relieve the industry of this province, the Yunnan Industrial Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Ministry of Finance, requesting the opening of industrial loans, with a minimum amount of 200 billion yuan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently replied that the principle has been agreed to and ordered that a specific plan be drafted for implementation after research.</p>
<h3>Five-Province Pacification Conference Concludes; Chairmen Return to Their Posts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 18th] The Five-Province Pacification Conference convened by the Jiujiang Command Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense concluded successfully on the 17th. After the meeting, Minister Bai inspected the Jiujiang Self-Defense Team and delivered an impromptu speech. The five provincial chairmen who came here to attend the meeting returned to their posts on the morning of the 18th.</p>
<h3>Lin Wei and Others Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense Lin Wei and Department Chief Liu Zhihan, US military advisor Brigadier General Brink, and others, after completing their inspection of the new training base in Taiwan, took off from Pingtung on the afternoon of the 18th and arrived in Nanjing at around 5:00 PM. It is understood that Commander-in-Chief Sun Liren will also come to Nanjing again in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Five Cities to Expand Food Rationing; Food Source Problem Resolved; Rationing Committee to be Established with the Mayor as the Ex Officio Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] After the principle of expanding food rationing in five major cities was passed by the Price Committee of the All-Economic Conference, Food Minister Yu Feipeng immediately ordered his subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation of food sources and draft detailed implementation measures. It is now understood that the food source problem has been largely resolved, and the Ministry of Food is drafting measures for the amount of rationed food, the price of rationed food, and ration purchase certificates, which can be completed within a week and implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan. At the same time, it has been decided to establish rationing committees in the five major cities to manage the rationing, with the mayor as the ex officio chairman, and the committee will be staffed by one commissioner or counselor sent by the Ministry of Food as one of the standing committee members. The remaining members will include one person sent by the Relief Supplies Handling Committee and representatives from relevant agencies of the municipal government, totaling seven people. In addition, the rumor that the rationing price will be two dou for large families and one dou for small families refers to the rationing of rice for poor households, while the amount for civil servants and teachers is still under discussion.</p>

<h3>Our US Loan Plan; Zhang Jia'ao in Nanjing Collecting Data; Divided into Two Departments: Currency Reform and Economic Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] As the new US aid to China bill is about to be submitted, our country's plan to use US loans, in addition to the part already taken by the technical delegation sent by our country to the United States, led by Bei Zuyi and others, is still missing a lot of data due to Bei's hasty departure. Zhang Jia'ao is now responsible for collecting it. Zhang, who arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai three days ago, has been in frequent contact with relevant agencies in recent days and is busy collecting data. Several senior officials from the Central Bank are also assisting Zhang in his duties. The data collected by Zhang can be divided into two major departments: one is data on currency reform, and the other is data on economic construction. The latter includes various departments such as transportation, water conservancy, agriculture and forestry, and industrial mining, with a very wide scope. After arriving in the United States, Bei also sent a telegram to Zhang, saying that the data he brought was not sufficient and requested that he continue to collect and send it to the United States. Zhang plans to stay in Nanjing for two more days and return to Shanghai on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] A Shanghai newspaper reported that Zhang Jia'ao will become the Minister of Finance. According to people close to Zhang on the 18th, this news is absolutely incorrect. Zhang's visit is purely to collect data on our country's plan to use US loans. The rumor that he is discussing the resumption of industrial and commercial loans with the authorities is also incorrect.</p>
<h3>Unrest in Fujian Waters; Naval Headquarters Sends Warships to Patrol; Land-Based Bandits Also Rampant</h3>
<p>[Our Xiamen Dispatch, 18th] Recently, there has been unrest in Fujian waters. In order to ensure the safety of overseas Chinese merchants and travelers, the Xiamen Naval Patrol Office telegraphed the Naval Headquarters requesting warships to patrol and govern the sea. On the 17th of this month, the headquarters sent a large 4,000-ton warship, the "Zhonglian," which arrived in Xiamen from Shantou. Captain Lin Pu, a lieutenant colonel, went ashore this morning to visit the Naval Patrol Office and discussed the coastal security issues in detail.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Guanqiao Town in Tongan County (near Xiamen) was suddenly infiltrated by more than 200 armed bandits on the morning of the 17th. The police station chief and five soldiers were killed. The security self-defense team suffered heavy losses. The Yi warehouse of the Tianliang Office was looted, and a puppet National Salvation Army Headquarters was established in the Chamber of Commerce, wantonly looting. The people suffered heavy losses. The suppression army is still in confrontation.</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 18th] Bandits are rampant in the Chang Le Yongtai area of Fujian. The provincial government is now dispatching powerful troops to rush to the scene. In addition, the Guangdong bandit Li Zhongxian's troops have fled to the Zhao'an area near the province. In eastern Fujian, the pseudo-People's Livelihood Army is also restless. The provincial security authorities have established a bandit suppression headquarters in Ningde and other counties to intensify the encirclement and suppression.</p>
<h3>Huo Baoshu Returns to Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Huo Binshu arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 18th to pay respects to the local authorities and request instructions on future entry and exit management policies. He returned to Shanghai by night train that evening.</p>
<h3>National Army in Southern Chahar Achieves Another Victory; Defeats Seven Bandit Regiments; Zhan Chi'nan Nearly Captured; National Army in Deng County Completes Outlying Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The National Army in Southern Chahar has achieved another victory. A powerful corps has penetrated deep into the Hebei-Jehol-Chahar border area to conduct suppression operations. On the 17th, seven bandit regiments were defeated, killing and wounding more than 3,000 bandits, including bandit regiment commander Wu Di. Bandit leader Zhan Danan was almost captured. In addition, the National Army on both sides of the Beiping-Ningyuan railway launched a mop-up operation. There are no more traces of bandits near Changli. It is also rumored that Mao Zedong recently presided over a meeting of the CCP Central Committee in Xingxian.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Communist bandit Li Yunchang's troops, numbering 4,000, crossed the Pingjin railway at Weishanzhuang, causing minor damage to the station and railway. After being met by the National Army, they fled southeast. Pingjin trains were delayed for three hours.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 18th] A large force of bandits is gathering again around Baoding. The main force of its Sixth Column moved from Tangxian Wangdu to Sanyucun, Sandianzhuang, Jiacun, and other areas in Mancheng on the morning of the 16th, and transported a large number of landmines, which were laid in the area north and east of Mancheng for several consecutive days, claiming that they would again attack the northwest stronghold of Baoding. In addition, the main force of the remnant Fourth Column arrived in Shangxiazikou in the northwest of Mancheng, and its Eleventh Brigade has crossed the upper reaches of the Caohe River to Wenjiatun Daokou and other places east of Mancheng.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Deng County battle, which has continued for ten days, has changed due to the attacking troops responding in concert with the reinforcements. On the 18th, the National Army completed the outlying operations and struck the invading bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 18th] More than 15,000 wounded soldiers from Chen Yi's bandit troops in eastern Henan were transported from north of Qixian across the Longhai Road to western Shandong yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 18th] Two columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops have a pattern of fleeing from Yanling and Fugou to Huaiyang. Xu Changfu's bandits also have a trend of retreating south.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 18th] According to the confessions of captured bandits, Liu's remnant troops in the Dabie Mountains are now in dire need of ammunition. Mao Zedong and Zhu De once instructed Chen Yi to find a way to transport supplies before the end of the old lunar year. Chen's bandits have been surrounded north of the Huai River and east of the Pinghan Road, and the attempt to transport ammunition to the bandits has been crushed.</p>
<h3>Various Banks and Bureaus Respond to the Joint Treasury; All Advocate Opening Credit; However, Scope is Narrowed and Strictly Restricted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the issue of whether or not to open credit, the Joint Treasury previously solicited opinions from various banks and bureaus. It has now received replies from the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Postal Savings Bureau, and the Cooperative Treasury. All advocate opening credit and have submitted this year's credit plans, but they advocate that after the credit is opened, the scope of credit should be narrowed and strictly restricted. It is also learned that the Joint Treasury is also studying the new credit plan for this year. This new plan is not a new method, but only a modification of the existing "Investment and Discount Policy" and "Revised Discount Principles." In the past, the scope of credit was wider, but it will be tightened in the future, and will be limited to six daily necessities and nine items such as transportation and public utilities exports. The credit interest rate will also be carefully studied. The purpose of the Joint Treasury's credit is to maintain production at a low interest rate, which has its advantages, but low interest rates can easily lead to hoarding. The method of ordering goods for credit is also under study, but Chairman Jiang once issued a handwritten instruction that credit should not be opened before the Lantern Festival, so there is no hope of opening it before the Lantern Festival.</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang to Immediately Fly to Shenyang to Assume New Post; Chairman Held Banquet Yesterday Afternoon to Instruct on Important Matters; Northeast Bandit Troops Gathering and Plotting to Make Trouble Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Chairman Chiang held a banquet at his official residence at 1 p.m. on the 18th for Wei Lihuang and his wife. Around 9 p.m., Wei met with the Chairman again to request instructions on matters related to bandit suppression in the Northeast. Wei is currently actively preparing to go to Shenyang to assume his new post. Chairman Chiang ordered him to fly to Shenyang on the 19th, but Wei believes that there are still important official matters to be dealt with in Nanjing and that he needs to collect information on the bandit situation in the Northeast, so he will not be able to depart until the 21st at the earliest. On the afternoon of the 18th, Liu Shiyi visited Wei, and at 9:30 p.m., Zhang Zhizhong also visited Wei for a long talk. Furthermore, the selection of the deputy commander-in-chief and chief of staff for bandit suppression in the Northeast will be announced after Wei arrives in Shenyang. Although Chen Cheng has decided to return to Nanjing for rest, the date of his return has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 18th] Chen Cheng said on the 18th: The establishment of a bandit suppression headquarters in the Northeast can demonstrate the central government's determination to suppress bandits. Wei, concurrently commander-in-chief, has a glorious history in the revolution and the War of Resistance, and he can certainly shoulder the heavy responsibility. In the future, I will devote myself to the political and economic problems of the Northeast to cooperate with the military and complete the bandit suppression task.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] The National Army, supported by local forces, launched another attack on Beizhen, inflicting blows on the bandits.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 18th] It is reported from Nanjing on the 18th that 300,000 communist bandits are gathered around Shenyang, and a decisive battle in the Northeast is expected to begin within a few days. The US Consul General in Pan Yang, Walter, was summoned by the State Department and left Pan Yang yesterday to return to the country (Walter arrived in Peiping on the 18th) to present a report on the situation in the Northeast to the State Department in person, which further proves the seriousness of the situation. In addition, the appointment of General Wei Lihuang as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the Northeast, the landing of General Fan Hanjie's mechanized units from Qingdao on the northern coast of Sha, and the active deployment of the National Army's air force all indicate that the Northeast war situation is approaching a decisive stage. It is learned that air force squadrons have been moved from bases in North China and elsewhere to locations closer to the front lines in the Northeast. Furthermore, after the establishment of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the Northeast will be divided into nine pacification zones, each with a commander.</p>
<p>[United Press, Qingyang, 18th] The situation in this area near here today is calm, with only scattered skirmishes. It is widely believed that the communist bandits are regrouping and attempting to make a comeback. The main concern of the National Army at present is to open up railway traffic with the Chinese mainland to launch the most effective counter-offensive against the communist economic war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 18th] A telegram from Pan Yang states that five groups of bandits in southern Liaoning are ready to move, while other teams are moving south to join bandit units near central Liaoning. Communist bandits have also secretly crossed the Liao River on the northern bank, and major battles are about to occur on the northern, eastern, and southern sides of Shenyang.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The People Must Survive, the Nation Must Become Strong! The Significance of the General Mobilization for Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various circles in Shanghai held a mobilization meeting for suppressing rebellion and building the nation. Representatives of refugees from bandit areas in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Shandong successively recounted their bitter and cruel experiences, deeply moving the three to four thousand attendees. Speaker Pan said, "Our decline in international status and the loss of opportunities for recuperation after the war are all the crimes of the communist bandits." Mayor Wu said, "If the communist bandits are not eliminated, China will perish. If the communist bandits are eliminated, China will become strong." Committee Member Fang of the Kuomintang said, "Without suppressing the communist bandits, we cannot build the nation." Youth Party representative Xiao Bingxing then said, "Only by suppressing rebellion and banditry can we restore the countryside, increase production, ensure that everyone has food to eat, and everyone has clothes to wear." What is the reason for their unanimous call?</p>
<p>Simply put, it is two sentences: For the people to survive and for the nation to become strong!</p>
<p>For these two points alone, we must suppress rebellion with all our strength, and we must build the nation with all our strength.</p>
<p>Originally, we had endured eight long years of hardship in the War of Resistance against Japan, shedding blood and sweat, contributing money and effort. Under the leadership of our wise leader and fighting alongside our allies, we finally won the victory and made the tyrannical enemy surrender. Our people should have been able to breathe a sigh of relief and live a good life. Our country had also abolished unequal treaties with foreign powers and joined the ranks of the world's four or five strongest nations. With continued efforts, it should have naturally become strong. But what is the situation today?</p>
<p>Prices are rising day by day, life is becoming more and more difficult. Not only is the situation before the war now just a beautiful dream, but even the hardships at the beginning of the victory are now almost unattainable. We all feel the heavy burden of living expenses, we all see the increase in the unemployed population, and we are all gradually about to cry out for help, saying that we cannot survive! But we must think carefully, to whom do we owe this? If there were no communist bandits selling out the interests of the nation and stirring up chaos, we would certainly be able to build peacefully, increase production, expand the fruits of victory, and raise the standard of living. How could we have become increasingly difficult, year after year, and feel that we are about to be unable to survive? Try closing your eyes and thinking: In the past two years, how many miles of railways have been destroyed by the communist bandits? How many mines have been destroyed? How many acres of farmland have been abandoned? How many lives have been slaughtered and destroyed? How many properties have been burned, looted, and plundered? All of these, the source of our people's livelihood, will be exhausted due to the long-term destruction by the brutal communist bandits. How can the people not be poor, and how can they not lament that they cannot survive? Fellow compatriots in Shanghai, fellow compatriots in the non-pacification areas of the rear, everyone should recognize two points: 1. The reason why our people today feel that they cannot survive is all due to the rampant rebellion of the communist bandits. 2. If we are not vigilant today and do not quickly rise up, enduring the pain for a while, contributing all our manpower and resources to support the government in suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion as soon as possible, then we may not be able to attain the living standards we have today in the future, and we may even suffer the same fate as our compatriots in the bandit areas today!</p>
<p>Today, we can hear the painful cries of hunger and cold from the mouths of refugees from the bandit areas. We can see the brutal outlines of murder and torture on the faces of refugees from the bandit areas. They cannot till the land, they cannot work, they cannot read books, they cannot protect their property, they cannot keep their homes, and they cannot even live their lives. They are struggled against, purged, framed, and massacred. Under severe punishments, they are even forced to watch their sons kill their fathers, brothers kill their brothers, husbands and wives become enemies, and friends become foes. Acts that destroy humanity and undermine ethics are commonplace. Although the communist bandits call for land reform or class struggle, trying to deceive the peasants and laborers, the communist bandits' ultimate goal is to seize all means of production by using murderous and arsonist violence. Therefore, they must kill all owners of the means of production for their own pleasure. As a result, peasants who originally obtained land by liquidating landlords may be liquidated in a blink of an eye, and shop assistants who originally seized stores by struggling against shopkeepers may be struggled against in a blink of an eye. At the extreme end of liquidation and struggle, they will inevitably force the people to die. Those who oppose the communist bandits cannot survive in the bandit areas, and those who think that they do not care about politics and have no conflict with the bandits can never survive. Even the ignorant masses who blindly follow the communist bandits and are coerced by them, or the intellectuals who echo the communist bandits and promote them, can never survive in the end. Everyone is constantly worried and does not know which day they will lose their lives. Even breathing has almost lost its freedom, so what is the meaning of "living"? Today, the Taiyuan telegram in this newspaper states that Yan Xishan said that the communist bandits are currently strictly purging the party, forcing cadres to "join the army" (i.e., become soldiers), disbanding schools, forcing students to join the army, reducing food rations, and driving farmers to the battlefield. All of these are enough to prove that the compatriots in the bandit areas are all in a pitiful state of being persecuted and sacrificed. One day, they will not be able to survive even if they want to, and they are truly suffering the pain of not being able to survive! To save ourselves, to save our compatriots, and to enable the people to survive, there is no other way today but to be of one heart and one mind, contribute money and effort, and mobilize everything we have to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the War of Resistance against Japan, our country's position at the Cairo Conference and its position when the United Nations was first established, its independent and autonomous dignity, and its glorious appearance as a great power made everyone feel honored. Given a few years of peaceful construction, national prosperity, and a strong nation, which country would dare to insult us again? Unfortunately, the communist bandits are prone to foreign flattery, and selling out the country is their duty. They spare no effort in harassing and destroying. As a result, our international status has declined. The defeated Japan is gradually rising, and the main culprit, Tojo, is actually brazenly defending his crimes. The Allied Soviet Union has exceeded the scope of its one-sided coercion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, occupying Lushun and Dalian, cutting off the Northeast, and supporting the communist bandit rebellion for its own pleasure. And the United Kingdom, with whom we once suffered together and fought side by side in India and Myanmar, now has the Hong Kong government allowing the police to stage violent acts of demolishing residences in Kowloon City and shooting Chinese people, taking it lightly and not feeling strange. We try to think, in less than two years, why has our country's international status declined so much! If the communist bandits are not eliminated for one day, and the great chaos is not put down for one day, then the country will not be able to embark on the road to prosperity and strength for one day, and the Chinese people will not be able to hold their heads up for one day.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are indeed peace-loving people, and China is by no means an aggressive country. However, in this turbulent world situation, if China wants to gain a foothold in the future, it must lay a solid foundation for prosperity and strength within three to five years. If China misses the great opportunity to strengthen itself after the Second World War, then not only will incidents like the residents of Kowloon City being humiliated and Lushun and Dalian being forcibly occupied by neighboring countries continue to occur, but there may also be even greater events. Even a full-scale invasion of external violence, such as the September 18th Incident and the July 7th Incident, who knows which day it may be added to our heads. We should really wake up quickly! Without self-improvement, there is only destruction! However, if the communist bandits are not eliminated, and the disturbance is endless, how can China become strong? Therefore, if we want to make the country strong, we must endure all hardships and use all our strength to suppress and eliminate the communist bandits as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The city of Shanghai is full of patriotic and people-loving people, and they are naturally enthusiastic about saving refugees and saving the motherland, hoping that the people can live and the country can become strong. But at the same time, Shanghai is also full of soulless people. The fire has already burned their eyebrows, but they are still indulging in extravagance and decadence, living a life of stolen pleasure! We must call on these soulless people to wake up! To enable the people to live and to make the country strong, we must quickly mobilize and build the nation to quell the rebellion!</p>

The words are: Alas, the towering Zhang Gong, a pioneer of the country, revived in Japan, nurtured great integrity, and experienced many dangers. Having eliminated the Qing Dynasty, he became the director of the Senate, preventing gradual extinction. The great robber moved the country, deeply worried and treading on a tiger, with far-sighted and high strategies, he was truly a chief planner. Recreating the universe, the nine prefectures were at peace. Roaming north and south, saving the dying and healing the wounded, the bandits rose up, yet breathing was still possible. Suppressing rebellion and building the nation, truly relying on the ultimate plan, unyielding and unbending, repeatedly establishing great achievements. The War of Resistance was victorious, but there was no small rest. Deliberating and anticipating, holding three times and spitting three times, looking around anxiously, diligently sighing. He would wield his vigorous pen to promote my Orchid Pavilion. How could he suddenly suffer this hundredfold sorrow? Recalling the good assistant, my heart is filled with grief. Decorating the end and rewarding merit, his clear fragrance will last ten thousand years. Alas, may he rest!</p>

<h3>Yan Xishan Discusses Four Signs Proving that Communist Bandits Will Take Cruel and Blind Actions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] "There are now four signs proving that the communist bandits believe that the prolonged war is unfavorable to them and that they will break the pot and make a desperate gamble this year, taking cruel and blind actions." This is the conclusion made by Yan Xishan, director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, when analyzing the communist bandit rebellion. Yan said: The communist bandits have reached the end of their rope and are making a final struggle before their demise. There are four signs that can illustrate this phenomenon: 1. Strict party cleansing, all cadres, officers, and soldiers of peasant origin are being purged to avoid wavering when the final decisive battle is fought; 2. Forcing cadres to join the army, most of the administrative work has been stopped. If he is not preparing for a decisive battle, he would not do so, nor is it necessary; 3. Disbanding schools, forcing all the young students who have been lured to join the army, and reorganizing land and reforming accounting and struggle work groups; 4. Reducing food rations, not making long-term plans to increase production, but driving farmers to the battlefield. Yan further pointed out that the communist bandits' cruelty is not a matter of the "human nature" of communist members, but under the erroneous viewpoint of communism, cruel killing is necessary and permanent, because the principle of communism is to seize the means of production by violence, not to peacefully transform and reform the old system, and it is inevitable to kill all owners of the means of production. Also, because communism uses power to collect all products and distributes the products itself, it will inevitably eliminate laborers who are unwilling to be its cattle and horses. Therefore, farmers who have been liquidated and have gained land are liquidated again in no time. In this way, the communist bandits' killing is like cutting grass, and it will never end. Therefore, we must recognize the communist bandits' faces, mobilize all our strength, and quell the bandit rebellion.</p>

<h3>Security Council Recommends India and Pakistan to Peacefully Resolve Dispute; Assists Both Sides in Finding a Common Solution</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] The representatives of India and Pakistan attending the United Nations Security Council to participate in the Kashmir case debate agreed today to the British proposal that the chairmen of the Indian and Pakistani delegations hold talks on the weekend, chaired by the President of the Security Council, to seek a common ground for resolving the Kashmir issue. Prior to the establishment of the agreement to hold the aforementioned talks, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan delivered a long speech, pointing out that India intends to occupy Kashmir for a long time, and that Pakistan had suggested a friendly solution to India seven times, but was rejected by the Indian side. In the whipping and meeting with Indian 　 Mountbatten, Pakistan suggested an immediate halt to all combat doors, and that external pen teams should withdraw from Kashmir, and that a referendum should be held under joint supervision. After denying India's accusations against Pakistan, 　 said: Anyone entering Kashmir, including the Indian army, must withdraw, and the war must be stopped so that normal administration can be restored. Pressure should not be applied to the people of Kashmir, and we should abide by the resolution established by the people of Kashmir. The Security Council then passed a resolution proposed by Chairman Quackenhoff with nine votes to zero (the Soviet Union and Ukraine 　rights), asking the Indian and Pakistani governments to take all measures immediately to improve the situation, and not to have any remarks or measures that would further worsen the situation. . [Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th, United Press] The United Nations Security Council had previously heard the Pakistani representative conclude its emergency call. 　. United Press believed that the United Nations would recommend the establishment of a fine machine for conciliation between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute.

Congress Chairman Prasad announced the matter to a crowded room in Birla House. Gandhi smiled silently. The people declared, "Gandhi has now ended his fast and trusts us. The responsibility lies entirely with us, and we must act in accordance with his trust." The news that Gandhi had begun to eat was first spread by his grandniece and girl. As she burst down to announce the news to the waiting reporters in Hindi, she was even tearful with joy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Governor-General Mountbatten, who had just returned from Bikaner State, visited Gandhi's bedside with his wife tonight and left after about 20 minutes. Gandhi's fast has entered its fifth day, and doctors have announced that his health is definitely getting weaker. Thousands of peace-loving people surround Birla House, where Gandhi lives, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru has personally gone to address them. Gandhi wrote on his sickbed a speech to be delivered at the prayer meeting, including the words "I am practically lying on my deathbed". Indian Education Minister Aruna Asaf Ali revealed to the crowd of 50,000 people attending the peace conference the seven conditions for Gandhi to end his fast, saying that Gandhi could resume eating after receiving a satisfactory guarantee on the following points: 　The annual race meeting to be held near Bahat , Delhi, where the Muslim shrine is located, must be held as scheduled, and Hindus should ensure that Muslims can participate freely. 　The 117 mosques in the Delhi area that were converted into temples or residences after the great riots last September should be restored to mosques by non-Muslims without government 　force. 　Muslims should be able to travel freely in the 　Delhi area. 　Non-Muslims in Delhi should not oppose Muslims returning to Delhi from Pakistan. 　Muslims traveling by train should not be at risk of loss of life or property. 　Economic boycotts should not be imposed on Muslims. 　The resettlement of Hindus in Muslim areas is handled by Muslims.</p>

Attlee and Morrison have already made candid remarks on the Soviet Union, and this issue will undoubtedly be mentioned by the Foreign Secretary.</p>
<h3>US Foreign Aid Should Include Asia and the Far East - UN Philippine Representative Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] Carlos P. Romulo, the chief representative of the Philippine delegation to the United Nations, received the 1947 World Statesman Gold Medal of Honor from the International Franklin Society here today. In his speech, he stated that U.S. foreign aid must include Asia and the Far East to ensure peace and maintain America's credibility. At this critical juncture in the world situation, the United States needs friendship, and the 1.2 billion people of Asia and the Far East also need the friendship of the United States. We are currently facing a crisis in thought and power, with the American way of life on one side and theories contrary to democracy on the other. The Filipino people are determined to see the American way of life not only endure forever but also prevail supreme.</p>
<h3>The Marshall Plan Is a Weapon to Combat the Soviets - Dulles Delivers Speech in New York</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] Republican foreign policy spokesman John Foster Dulles stated that the United States must use food and creative ideas to combat the Soviet Union's weapons of "propaganda and sabotage" throughout the world. Dulles, a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and advisor to Marshall during the recent Four-Power Conference, said at a luncheon of the New York Foreign Policy Association on the 17th that the Marshall Plan is the most powerful weapon against aggression for the United States. It is claimed that at the end of the war, Soviet leaders considered us enemies rather than friends. The Soviet Union adopted this strategy because Moscow is the "supreme authority of the Soviet Communist Party" and will carry out ideological struggles throughout the world. He also stated that the Soviet Union's weapons for global hegemony are "propaganda techniques" and strikes and sabotage. The United States must use food, fuel, and creative ideas and ideals to achieve peace. The first stage of achieving peace ended with the breakdown of the recent Council of Foreign Ministers meeting; the second stage has shown the battle between East and West to be escalating. If the United States' plan to counter Communist sabotage fails, the losses will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>US Relief Supplies Arrive in France in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] U.S. Ambassador to France, Jefferson Caffery, told the American Chamber of Commerce here today that relief supplies under the U.S. emergency aid to France, worth $53 million, arrived in France in the 24 days up to January 10th, including 115,000 tons of coal, 140,000 tons of grain, 200,000 tons of gasoline, and 28,000 tons of fertilizer, chemicals, and raw cotton. Caffery also said that the United States considers France to be the key to the reconstruction of Western Europe.</p>
<h3>US Sends Fleet to the Mediterranean, Scale Similar to Wartime - US and Turkey Hold Lengthy Secret Talks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th, United Press] Admiral Conolly, commander of the U.S. Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleet, stated that the "special composite fleet" sent by the United States to the Mediterranean is of a scale similar to that of wartime.</p>
<p>[United Press, Malta, 17th] The U.S. aircraft carrier "Midway," escorted by the destroyers "Perry" and "Edison" and the light cruisers "Little Rock" and "Providence," sailed to Malta on the 17th, awaiting the arrival of 1,000 Marines from the United States scheduled to arrive tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 17th] President İnönü and U.S. Ambassador Wilson held talks at the presidential residence until dawn on the 17th, causing much excitement here and numerous rumors. Both the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials declined to comment on the matter.</p>
<h3>Aid to Europe Is Not for Obtaining Bases - Marshall Issues Statement - Intention Is Only to Rebuild European Economy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] After Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday about the possible connection between the European Recovery Program and obtaining overseas bases, the State Department received information that Forrestal's remarks had aroused extreme interest and concern in Europe. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement today, stating that the European Recovery Program currently under review by Congress neither stipulates nor contemplates obtaining military bases in exchange for U.S. economic aid to Europe.</p>
<p>The intention of U.S. aid is solely to enable countries participating in the recovery program to rebuild their sound and strong economies. This objective does not conflict with the opinions expressed by Secretary of Defense Forrestal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In response to a question about the importance of overseas bases, Forrestal stated that he did not dispute this concept and believed that the Secretary of State had not forgotten this point either, but he believed that, in terms of priorities, he should first consider the restoration of the recipient countries' national beliefs. Forrestal's remarks have apparently been misinterpreted.</p>
<h3>Molotov Hosts Diplomatic Envoys</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Peterson, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, along with diplomatic representatives from other countries, attended a reception hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Molotov today for Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and his trade delegation.</p>
<h3>Wallace Delivers Speech, Advocates Forming a Third Party, and Criticizes Truman and the Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chicago, 17th] U.S. presidential election independent candidate Henry Wallace delivered a speech here today to the second annual meeting of the American Progressive Citizens Association, formally advocating the establishment of a third party "for peace, security, and prosperity." He pointed out that the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan, misusing the name of European Recovery," are "war policies controlled by big business for its own benefit," and said, "The inflation and excessive profit plans of the Democratic and Republican parties will cause economic panic and the outbreak of war." Wallace also suggested: immediately increase wages, stipulate a minimum wage of one dollar per hour, preserve and promote the legal system of forty hours per week of work; implement effective controls to lower prices, strip away windfall profits gained from inflation, and reject the bi-partisan "eat less" policy of Taft and Truman; abolish the Taft-Hartley Act restricting union activities; abandon policies heading toward war. Wallace also said: "If the Democratic government had not abandoned the Roosevelt plan, my supporters would not have been forced to establish a new party. In the January election, millions of voters will elect those who refuse to agree to policies that cause another world war and plunge the U.S. economy into an unprecedented depression. The current out-of-control price increases are all caused by government, big business fraud, and Wall Street's windfall profits. Although the Democratic and Republican parties see inflation as a sin, they have not taken genuine steps to combat it. President Truman has only made ineffective gestures, and his proposed war policies will inevitably lead to higher prices and greater profits."</p>
<h3>Balkan Committee Accuses Albania of Supporting Greek Guerrillas - Second Report to Trygve Lie</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 17th] The United Nations Balkan Committee recently submitted its second interim report to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, paying special attention to the recent incident in the Yannina-Konitsa area. The conclusion reached was that Albania provided various strategic and material aid to the Greek guerrillas during the attack on Konitsa and assisted them in organizing supplies. The report is based on the conclusions reached by the committee's team, which was sent to the front line from December 29th to January 2nd to investigate. The report also recognizes that Albania's aid to Greek guerrillas is contrary to the spirit of the UN General Assembly resolution of October 21st last year. Furthermore, it said that the speech made by the Bulgarian Prime Minister on December 31st also reflects Bulgaria's failure to comply with the UN General Assembly's recommendations to establish good neighborly relations with Greece.</p>
<h3>Italy Establishes Anti-Communist Liberation Army</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 18th] Marshal Messe, who led Italian troops in battles against the Soviet Union and Tunisia during the war, was appointed chairman of the Italian Liberation Army, an anti-communist center in military circles, on the 18th. At the same time, Prime Minister Nitti immediately declared that Messe had no connection with the neo-fascist Social Movement.</p>
<h3>Italy Pardons Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 17th] The Italian cabinet today approved an amnesty law to reduce death sentences to life imprisonment and life imprisonment to 30 years imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Plan to Build Channel Tunnel to Defend Against Atomic Bomb Attacks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th] Britain and France began negotiations here today for an underground tunnel under the English Channel for trains and cars, which can also withstand atomic bomb attacks. The two countries have been negotiating the construction of an underwater tunnel for a year. This time, it is hosted by British Labor MP Crossman and Conservative MP Bullock, as well as the French members of the United Tunnel Committee. According to the current design of Basterfang, the head of the committee's technical team, the tunnel starts from Cap Griz-Nez in France to Folkestone in England, with a total length of 28 miles and an estimated cost of 50 million pounds sterling. It is an average of 50 feet underground, 160 to 220 feet lower than the sea surface. In the event of war, an atomic bomb explosion in the air or on the water surface would have little impact. The previous tunnel plan was only for trains, winding from Calais to Dover, a distance of 30 miles. Engineers now advocate adopting a straight line, with double tracks for railways and two separate lanes for highways, along with air ducts and water pumps, electric lights, and ventilation equipment.</p>
<h3>US Bans Flying Over Nuclear Energy Plants</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman has ordered a ban on flying over three nuclear sites: the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Hanford Engineering Works in Richland, Washington; and the Los Alamos plant in Los Alamos, New Mexico.</p>
<h3>Japan Builds 200,000 Tons of Ships Since the End of the War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] According to charts shown to reporters by senior officials of the Japanese Ministry of Transport responsible for shipping, Japan has built 200,000 tons of ships since the end of the war: 130,000 tons in 1946 and 60,000 tons in 1947 up to the end of November. Japan currently has one million tons of diesel ships, of which 930,000 tons are usable, and the remainder is in dock for repairs due to prolonged use. Japan's post-war domestic routes require a minimum of 4.5 million tons of ships. If Japan can fully utilize its shipbuilding equipment, it can build 800,000 tons of ships per year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Socialist Party Subcommittee Decides to Abolish Four-Party Agreement - Submitted to the General Assembly for Final Decision</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] On the afternoon of the 17th, the second day of the third national convention of the Socialist Party, the subcommittee was held. First, Chairman Suzuki of the Policy Investigation Committee explained the proposal to abolish the four-party policy agreement and suspend the payment of interest on wartime government bonds.</p>
<p>The left and right factions engaged in fierce debate, causing chaos at the venue, which lasted for about two hours before being put to a vote. As a result, it was passed by a vote of 24 to 19 (one abstention), and it was decided to submit it to the plenary session today for final decision.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Since the opening of the Japanese Socialist Party Congress, the situation seems to be quite intense due to the control of the venue by Kato Kanjyu, chairman of the government investigation committee. There is a high probability that the four-party policy agreement will be abolished. The third day of the meeting continued today, and the 11 committees separately reviewed more than 60 proposals submitted by various branches. After the deliberation by the committees was completed in the afternoon, a general meeting was convened again, and the chairmen of the committees reported the results of the review by their respective groups, and the issue of the four-party policy agreement was raised again, requesting a new decision. At the same time, the issue of the candidates for the party chairman and secretary-general is being asked to be nominated by the same faction, but the left-wing has not yet officially expressed its attitude. It seems that they will be willing to express peace or war only after the issue of the four-party policy agreement is resolved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Postal and Telecommunications Fees Increase Threefold</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese Cabinet decided yesterday to increase all postal and telecommunications fees threefold from the 15th of this month, which will increase our revenue by 13 times this fiscal year.</p>
<h3>Yap Island Tsunami</h3>
<p>[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 17th] A tsunami struck Yap Island, a small U.S. outpost in the western Pacific, yesterday, destroying most of the island's buildings and all of its food supplies. The island's 3,000 residents fled to higher ground, avoiding disaster. The tsunami occurred 48 hours after a typhoon passed through.</p>
<h3>Socialist Party Left and Right Factions Fight and Wrestle Together</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese Social Democratic Party Congress fell into chaos when frantic left-wingers and right-wingers fought and tried to wrestle with the chairman of the congress, Komakichi Matsuoka.</p>
<h3>Eastern Europe Decides to Strengthen Economic Cooperation - Organization of Federation Still Pending - Hopes to Trade with Western Europe on Equal Principles</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Bucharest, 17th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov declared before boarding a train to return home after signing the Romanian-Bulgarian mutual assistance treaty in Bucharest: The Eastern European countries will organize a federation as soon as the time is ripe and will carry out large-scale cooperation with the Soviet Union. If possible, they also plan to try to trade with the United States, Britain, and France on a completely equal principle.</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 18th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov said that the strengthening of economic cooperation among the Balkan countries can be the basis for starting trade with Western Europe and possibly with the United States. He said, "We hope to cooperate economically with Britain, the United States, France, and other countries, but cooperation must be based on the principle of equality. We oppose the imperialist policies implemented by British and American trusts, but the Danube countries hope to maintain good economic relations with all Western European countries, and this cannot be decided unilaterally by us."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Officials declared today that Communist International leader Dimitrov's announcement that an Eastern European Federation will soon be established shows that the Soviet Union is prepared to take the final step to permanently consolidate its control over the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Dimitrov's statement roughly represents the Communist Party's high policy and is worthy of attention. The nature of the Communist Party's opposition to the Marshall European Recovery Program has not changed as a result and is even more obvious, which is an inevitable result. If Western and Eastern Europe cooperate according to the Marshall Plan, although it will not hinder the establishment of the Eastern European Federation, it will inevitably add complications.</p>

<h3>At the Canluan and National Construction Mobilization Conference, Refugees Bitterly Narrate the Atrocities of the Communist Bandits - Speaker Appeals to Citizens to Concentrate Their Efforts to Overcome Difficulties Together</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Speaker Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, at the Shanghai Municipal People of All Circles Canluan and National Construction Mobilization Conference yesterday, delivered a speech to more than 3,000 people from all walks of life about the Communist bandits' rebellion, which endangers China's destiny, and made a painful statement: "National survival, national livelihood, and people's lives are all seriously threatened by the Communist bandits. With the destruction of the Communist bandits, there is no existence of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>This unprecedented Canluan and National Construction Mobilization Conference was held at the Tianchan Dance Hall yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. More than 3,000 representatives from more than 1,000 units from all circles in the city and refugees from the bandit areas in northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong also sent representatives to participate. The venue was packed, and the atmosphere was extremely passionate. The conference was presided over by Pan Gongzhan as the general chairman, with Mayor Wu, Fang Zhi, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun, Chu Zheng Yuxiu, Xiao Bingshing, Tao Baichuan, Xie Renzhao, and Chen Baotai as the presidium. Inside and outside the venue, Boy Scouts and military police maintained order. At the beginning of the conference, General Chairman Pan first delivered an opening speech, explaining the meaning and objectives of the mobilization conference. He continued: "In the two years since the victory, the international status that the country had fought for with unlimited sacrifices has been destroyed by the Communist rebellion. After eight years of war and chaos, the Chinese people all need to recuperate and rest and need construction and production. But we have not obtained the peaceful and prosperous lives that we hoped for, and 450 million people are still living in hardship. We deeply review that the destroyers of the country and the people's happiness and interests are also the Communist bandits' rebellion. The people of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and the northeastern provinces were originally able to live in peace and prosperity after the victory, but now a large number of them are fleeing to other places or filling ditches. They are the most direct victims of the Communist bandits' rebellion. In addition to providing passive relief and assistance in terms of human sympathy, we must trace the root cause of this man-made disaster and actively participate in the work of suppressing bandits and chaos, so that cruel atrocities will never be seen again in history. If thousands of people believe that the work of 'Suppressing Chaos and Building the Country' only belongs to the Nationalists, this is a major illusion. What the Chinese people hope for is a 'Three Principles of the People Republic,' so that a true democratic unity can be realized, and the people of the whole country must jointly shoulder the responsibility of suppressing chaos. We are holding this mobilization conference today in the hope that the people of the whole city will concentrate their efforts from today onwards, overcome difficulties together, and give the Communist bandits' rebellion a fatal blow, hoping to completely eliminate it."</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu's Warning - If Communist Bandits Are Not Eliminated, China Will Perish</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying: After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, although we have achieved a great victory, the people's lives still cannot be peaceful and prosperous, and China's international status has also trended downward again. The Kowloon incident would never have happened if the international status had not declined. The reason for this is the Communist bandits' armed rebellion, which destroys unity. The government has the responsibility to maintain national stability, so it has to make the determination to suppress chaos with great pain. Therefore, if the Communist bandits hand over their weapons and the country is unified, there will be no problem in recovering Hong Kong and Kowloon today. Wu concluded: If the Communist bandits are not eliminated, China will perish, and if the Communist bandits are eliminated, China will be strong. I hope the citizens will recognize the goal and work together for Suppressing Chaos and Building the Country. Then Chairman Fang delivered a speech, emphasizing that if the country is to be built, chaos must be suppressed first. If chaos is not suppressed, construction cannot begin. Fang continued to point out that what the Communist bandits have done will not only destroy China but also endanger world peace. Fang then described in detail the atrocities of the Communist bandits in the bandit areas. Next, Xiao Bingshing, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department of the Youth Party, delivered a speech, elaborating on two points: Our country has always been a nation that loves peace and lives in peace, and the people of the country should strive to win it. Everyone should "have food to eat," not "everyone have food to eat".</p>
<h3>Searching for Young People to Drive to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Subsequently, representatives of exiled students from the communist areas, Yang Hanxun; refugees from northern Jiangsu, Sha Ren; refugees from Shandong, Cui Derun; and refugees from Anhui, Shi Guocong, successively reported on various atrocities they had personally witnessed in the communist areas. Yang Hanxun, when describing the actions of the communist bandits, referred to them as "not something a human would do; it's simply the behavior of beasts." He stated, "Wherever the communist bandits occupy, they search for ignorant villagers and young people, driving them to the front lines, using the people to suppress the rear, and ultimately using them as the main force to supervise the battle. The number of innocent civilians sacrificed is countless, and there have been situations where the national army has delayed military opportunities because they couldn't bear to kill ordinary people. Economically, they exploit everything to the extreme, requiring taxes of over 60 percent of the harvest, and forcing people to use unlimitedly issued counterfeit currency to collect resources."</p>
<p>Four Types of Torture</p>
<p>The following are several common tortures used in the communist areas: Boiling: The victim is stripped naked, their hands and feet tightly bound, and thrown into the river. Live Burial: The victim is buried entirely in the soil, with only their head exposed. After a month, their head is struck with a hammer, causing blood and brains to fly, leading to death. Crawling: Iron nails are hammered into the victim's fingers and toes, forcing them to crawl. Hanging: The victim's hands and feet are tied behind their back, and they are hung in the air, dying after several days.</p>
<p>Misled by the Communist Party, Forced to Kill His Father</p>
<p>The representative from northern Jiangsu, Sha Ren, in a sorrowful tone, recounted how he was a small businessman who was deceived by the communist bandits' "democracy" slogan and participated in the communist cadre work. However, during several "struggles," he was eventually ordered to kill his elderly father, who was of the petty bourgeoisie class. After returning home, he could only exchange tears with his father and couldn't bring himself to do it, so he changed clothes and fled his hometown overnight. However, his father was still eventually killed. Sha Ren also stated, "The communist bandits not only kill property owners within the occupied areas but also intellectuals. If the communist bandits come to Shanghai, everyone present today would also be on the list to be killed. When the communist bandits hold meetings, they don't hang the national flag or the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, but instead hang the flag with the sickle and axe and portraits of Lenin and Marx. Their treacherous conspiracy to sell out the country is already clearly visible. I am now a traitor to the communist party, but I firmly believe that actively participating in the suppression of the rebellion is a manifestation of pursuing truth and upholding justice." Cui Derun, the representative from Shandong, is a typical northern farmer. He was arrested along with his brother for the "crime" of having received elementary school education. After being detained for eight months and released, his brother was eventually executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>One Word Leads to Disaster and a Tragic Death</p>
<p>The representative from Anhui, Shi Guoting, recounted the tragic death story of a classmate from his elementary school days. The victim's "crime" was merely accidentally uttering the words "The Communist Party doesn't have much of a solution for the country either," which was overheard by a "communist special agent." He was then dragged along the ground with his hands tied behind his back, called "taking an airplane," and eventually died covered in blood. After the reports were finished, they passed a "Salute to President Chiang telegram" and a "Condolence telegram to the suppression of bandits generals and soldiers on the front lines," and then the entire assembly shouted slogans such as "Concentrate our efforts to suppress the rebellion and build the country," "Eliminate the communist bandits who disrupt peace," and "Demand that the government negotiate sternly to recover Hong Kong, Kowloon, Lushun, and Dalian." The ceremony concluded at 11:30 AM, and then entertainment programs were held, dispersing at noon. The municipal party headquarters' propaganda brigade dispatched several vehicles after the meeting and went to various districts for costumed propaganda until late at night.</p>
<p>US Donates Wireless Radio Equipment to Assist Our Amateur Activities: Remarks by Zhu Qiqing Upon Returning to China</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qiqing, the chief editor of the China Amateur Wireless Radio Association, was dispatched to the United States in July of last year as a representative of amateur radio enthusiasts in our country to attend the International Telecommunications Conference and exchange views on general issues with amateur radio enthusiasts from other countries. He has now returned to Shanghai. During his time in the United States, Mr. Zhu was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of amateur radio enthusiasts across the country. Our reporter visited Mr. Zhu yesterday to inquire about his impressions and gains from this trip. According to him, "Amateur radio activities in the United States are very advanced and lead the world, with over ten thousand radio stations. There is one radio station for every 1,500 people. During our country's war of resistance, the people of the United States admired us for utilizing limited equipment and facilities to actively engage in amateur activities and assist military communications. They believe that postwar wireless amateur activities in our country are crucial for telecommunications education and construction, and they are extremely willing to provide assistance. After discussions with academic groups such as the American Radio Relay League, General Electric Company, and other commercial firms, they have donated dozens of boxes of large quantities of vacuum tubes, transceivers, and other essential accessories, worth tens of thousands of US dollars, which are currently being shipped to China in batches."</p>

<h3>Various Industries Join Trade Associations: The Bureau of Social Affairs Formulates Three Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of membership in trade associations for various industries that distribute rationed goods, the Bureau of Social Affairs has previously received complaints from representatives of various industries that are not members, alleging that the associations refuse to admit them, creating a situation of control and monopoly, and harming the interests of the same industry. According to the various industry associations, there are often fictitious firms engaging in speculation and attempting to join the association to obtain rations.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that joining industry associations is compulsory by law and that associations should not arbitrarily refuse membership. However, to prevent unscrupulous merchants from engaging in speculation and profiteering, they should not be allowed to exploit loopholes and harm the development of legitimate businesses. To take both into account, the Bureau of Social Affairs has formulated three measures, instructing the various industry associations to comply: Companies, factories, and businesses that distribute rationed goods and already have a company license, factory registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, or a business registration certificate from the Bureau of Social Affairs, shall be allowed to join the association. If there are fictitious firms or concealment of distributed goods, violating the principles of preventing speculation and profiteering by merchants, the association shall report it to the Bureau of Social Affairs to revoke the business registration certificate or request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to revoke their license or factory registration certificate. The rights of new members (regarding ration distribution after joining the association) may be determined by the association's board of directors and supervisors, and a proposal submitted to the Bureau for approval before implementation. Subsequently, if the same situation arises, it should be handled in accordance with the above measures to ensure fairness and compliance with the law.</p>
<h3>American Missionary in Kaifeng Arrives in Shanghai, Discussing How the People in the Communist Bandit Areas Suffer Extreme Tyranny and Oppression</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the communist bandits shot and killed three foreign missionaries near Laohekou, the American Missionary Society ordered its personnel to withdraw south. Mr. Harris, the person in charge of the Baptist Church in Kaifeng, also withdrew to Shanghai some days ago. Mr. Harris has been preaching in China for thirty-seven years and will be returning to his country because of his old age. Our reporter visited Mr. Harris yesterday, and he shared his views on the communist bandits. Based on his years of observation and experience, Mr. Harris believes that anyone with reason and a true democratic view cannot compromise with the communist bandits. The impression of the communist bandits held by many people and church members who have escaped from the communist areas is that their methods are even harsher than those of the Japanese soldiers, and the extent of their destruction is more cruel than that of the Japanese invaders. Mr. Harris personally witnessed the communist bandits destroying railways and burning villages, which made him realize that the communist bandits' goal is to disrupt the national economy, make it impossible for every ordinary person to live and work in peace, and even make it impossible to make a living, trying every means to accomplish their conspiracy.</p>
<p>Major Losses of Rights and Freedoms</p>
<p>The reporter then asked whether the rumour that the communist bandits' administrative efficiency was generally higher was true. Mr. Harris immediately answered affirmatively that administrative efficiency might be slightly higher under a despotic and dictatorial regime. The dictatorial style of Hitler in the past was like this. However, the people's rights and freedoms suffer greatly as a result, and this loss cannot be compensated by the gains obtained after the administrative efficiency is improved. The people in the communist bandit areas suffer exploitation and oppression, which makes them feel even more fearful of the communist bandits' autocratic politics and cherish democratic politics.</p>
<p>Private Land Forcibly Divided Publicly</p>
<p>The reporter also asked that some people abroad have praised the communist bandits' land policy quite a bit, but what is the actual situation? Mr. Harris said that the communist bandits' so-called equal distribution of land is actually a deceptive policy. For example, Mr. Harris has a friend who owns more than 80 mu of land, but this is the property jointly owned by more than 40 members of their family. However, the family has not yet separated, and if it is divided, each person will only get two mu of land, but the communist bandits insist that they are big landlords and forcibly divide their land publicly. "In fact, how can more than 80 mu of land be called a big landlord?" Mr. Harris continued, "In the United States, it is very common to have landlords with hundreds of acres of land. I am a poor missionary, and I also have more than 500 acres of land (Note: One acre is equal to 6.07 Chinese mu). If I were a Chinese person living in the communist bandit area, wouldn't they also take my land and divide it equally?"</p>
<p>Full Assistance Will Come Sooner or Later</p>
<p>Mr. Harris also expressed his feelings about the current political situation in the central government, believing that the government's administrative efficiency should be improved, the organization of the masses should be more in-depth, and the administration should be clarified as soon as possible in order to increase the people's confidence in the government. In the military aspect, he believes that morale must be improved, and the grand strategy for suppressing the bandits should be to fight fire with fire, extensively launching guerrilla warfare so that the communist bandits are attacked everywhere. Mr. Harris also said with great confidence that the American people and government will understand the situation in China sooner or later, and they will provide China with full assistance sooner or later.</p>
<h3>Freight Rates Increased on Two Railways: The Chamber of Commerce Cables the Government to Stop</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration adjusted passenger and freight rates, the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce was the first to appeal, requesting the government to stop it. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also begun to respond, cabling the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications yesterday, requesting that the passenger and freight rates on the two railways be reasonably adjusted, and accusing the Railway Administration of acting contrary to the government's policy of suppressing price levels and stabilizing the economy. The Chamber of Commerce argued that after the dramatic increase in freight rates, industrial and commercial costs also increased, which would inevitably stimulate a sharp rise in prices. In addition to increasing revenue, the Railway Administration can also reduce expenditures, cutting redundant staff and curbing waste, which may be sufficient to help achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. However, it is now draining the pond to catch the fish, specializing in drastically increasing freight rates. Therefore, it urged the government to order the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration to stop the mad increase in passenger and freight rates and make reasonable adjustments.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Society of Mechanical Engineers Is Established</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the general headquarters of the Chinese Society of Mechanical Engineers in the summer of 1936, its members across the country have exceeded one thousand. During the War of Resistance, the Shanghai branch's affairs were suspended. After the victory, members from various places returned, and over twenty people in the Shanghai engineering community, including Wang Jingrong, Zhang Gongpin, and Hu Songyan, initiated the establishment of a branch and launched a fundraising campaign of 60 million to build a clubhouse. A temporary clubhouse has now been established in Jiaotong University's Gongchuo Hall, and a founding meeting was held in the hall yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Over fifty people, including Cheng Xiaogang, president of the Chinese Society of Engineers, attended, with Huang Boqiao serving as temporary chairman. Jiaotong University professor Hu Songyan reported on the preparations, the articles of association were approved, and Chen Shiying was elected as the first president, with Hu Songyan as vice president. Both are professors in the engineering college of Jiaotong University. Li Taifang, Chen Da, Wu Liangbi, Zhou Chengyou, and Yuan Bulie were elected as secretaries, and the meeting was declared concluded. Subsequently, Huang Boqiao, a senior figure in the engineering community, gave a speech stating that he hoped that the Shanghai branch would not only devote itself to academic development and research, but also hope that the association would complete the division of labor in automatic machinery manufacturing, shipbuilding, and other technologies, form specialized committees, and cooperate closely with industrial institutions to fully exploit the efficiency of machinery.</p>
<h3>Many Fires Due to Severe Winter Dryness: Sixty Fires in Half a Month, Reasons Why a Thousand-Member Volunteer Fire Brigade Is Difficult to Realize, Few People Are Willing to Undertake Hard and Dangerous Work</h3>
<p>[Special report from this newspaper] Fire! Fire! A heart-stopping fire has occurred again in the city in the past few days. Every day, every night, countless lives and property are sacrificed in the raging flames of fire. According to statistics from the Municipal Police Bureau's Fire Department, within half a month since the beginning of 1948, they have dispatched fire engines 69 times. Among them, excluding seven false alarms and two special protective measures for theaters, there were a total of 60 fire rescues. Although only 23 of them were major fires, the remaining 37 were extinguished early. However, an average of four fire alarms per day is enough to make us feel afraid.</p>
<p>Fires are closely related to the climate. It is customary that the number of fires is highest and the damage is most severe in the three months of December, January, and February. The reason for the high number is that the weather is cold and dry, and there are more cases of burning fires for heating. If one is not careful, it will lead to a disaster. If you encounter strong winds, it will be even more uncontrollable, so everyone should be extra cautious and careful during this severe winter.</p>
<p>Firefighting agencies are gradually being strengthened</p>
<p>When a fire occurs, it depends on the fire department to put it out. Since the Wuding Road fire last year, society has a new understanding of the importance of firefighting work. The firefighting agencies have been gradually strengthened under the supervision and assistance of all parties. In the past year, the funding and personnel have increased significantly, and the treatment has been improved, and tools have been added to give greater play to the performance and protect the public safety of citizens.</p>
<p>The department is now under the jurisdiction of the police bureau, and the general team is divided into nine district teams. The firefighting personnel include office staff, technicians, workers, etc., and there are currently 867 people. In terms of vehicles, there are now six light-duty ladder trucks, seventeen medium-sized pump trucks, sixteen large-sized pump trucks, one steam pump truck, one fireboat, one towing pump truck, six fire extinguishing and guard vehicles, ten special vehicles such as rescue vehicles and lighting vehicles, seventeen ambulances, and sixty-six other official vehicles, transport vehicles, bicycles, etc. Old water belts have been discarded, and more than 34,000 feet have been added in the past year. New vehicles are also being ordered from abroad, but due to foreign exchange difficulties and other reasons, it is difficult to realize in the short term.</p>
<p>Depends on the cooperation of all departments</p>
<p>To do a good job in firefighting, it is necessary to rely on the cooperation of relevant departments. For example, the water source at the fire location is the determining factor in extinguishing the fire. If the faucet is damaged or the water source pressure is too low, the fire brigade will be helpless, but many citizens misunderstand that the fire brigade is indifferent. For example, there have been frequent power outages in the Nanshi and French Concession areas recently. When a fire occurs, the water and electricity company must be notified temporarily to open it, which has an impact on the rescue time. All of these are technical difficulties in firefighting work. In view of this, the Municipal Administration Bureau established a firefighting committee at the end of November last year, which is composed of public and private organizations such as the Municipal Government, Police Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Senate, and local associations, and holds regular monthly meetings to discuss and solve various firefighting issues together.</p>
<h3>Every Citizen Should Fulfill Their Responsibility</h3>
<p>At the same time, because the danger of fire is closely related to every citizen, fire prevention is also the responsibility of every citizen, so the fire department attempted to organize a volunteer fire brigade of 1,000 people to assist in firefighting work, but this proposal has not been followed up by the Civil Affairs Bureau since it was transferred to the various Baojia last year. It is said that because this kind of work is too hard and dangerous, few people are willing to undertake it on a voluntary basis. In fact, this is related to the immediate interests of every citizen, and the fire department hopes that everyone can understand its significance and should participate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Finally, readers, please remember that if a fire occurs, you should quickly call the fire department. The number is "15440".</p>
<h3>Eight Thousand Tons of US Relief Flour Arrive: Acceptance Ceremony Today, Ration Distribution Expected to Begin in March, Proceeds Earmarked for Relief Expenses</h3>
<p>Eight thousand tons of US relief flour, transported by the California Wheel, arrived in China and entered the Huangpu River on the afternoon of the 18th, berthed at the China Merchants Bureau's Pier No. 1. At 3 PM today, the Chairman of the Relief Goods Processing Committee, Miao Jiaming, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, representatives from the United States, and others will board the ship to hold an acceptance ceremony and express their condolences to the US transportation personnel.</p>
<h3>Miao Jiaming's Remarks</h3>
<p>Miao Jiaming, chairman of the Executive Yuan's US Relief Goods Processing Committee, met with reporters on the 18th and answered questions regarding the processing of US relief goods, saying that the US government has donated approximately US$30 million worth of relief goods to China. The food portion of these goods includes 50,000 tons of flour (part of which is wheat) and 75,000 tons of rice, which are being shipped to China in succession, and some of them have already arrived in Shanghai. In addition, medical and health equipment worth approximately US$4 million has been requested to be listed by the Ministry of Health and sent to the US government, and it will be shipped to China soon. In addition, there are a small number of fertilizers and seeds included in the relief materials.</p>
<p>The Distribution Targets Strive for Universality</p>
<p>After the US grain is shipped to China, the Chinese government will take appropriate steps in accordance with the agreement in cities that have already conducted distribution to ensure that people of all classes receive fair and equal shares. However, due to the limited quantity, the distribution will first be implemented in the five cities with dense populations and lack of food. The distribution targets will strive for universality to ensure that everyone can benefit. All preparations for food distribution are currently being carried out by the authorities of the five cities, divided into distribution committees, which are proceeding separately. The specific distribution methods are also being planned in detail by the committee and the various municipal committees. The Beijing and Shanghai municipal committees have been established, and the Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan municipal committees will also be established successively. In the future, the distribution work in each city will be carried out by the municipal committees, entrusted to government agencies and volunteer organizations. It is now estimated that the US grain to be shipped to China is 125,000 tons. According to the average distribution of the population of the five cities, it is planned to be a four-month period. According to preliminary statistics, each person can obtain about five liters of grain per month. As for the distribution price, it will be lower than the market price. It will be adjusted once a month to achieve the goal of stabilizing grain prices. This distribution work is expected to begin in March.</p>
<p>Distribution Status Will Be Released at Any Time</p>
<p>As for the disposal of relief materials by the committee, it will be based on the principle of fairness. The work will be carried out absolutely openly. The committee's administrative accounting will be handled by personnel sent by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the financial accounting will be handled by accountants. The National Bank will handle the receipt and payment. The material battle situation and distribution status will also be released in reports at any time. The funds obtained will be used in full for relief expenses in accordance with the agreement. This is the food portion.</p>
<p>Medical Equipment Can Be Applied For</p>
<p>Regarding the medical and health equipment portion, the competent authorities are also properly formulating measures. In the future, direct relief will be implemented with medical equipment on the one hand, and a portion of the medical equipment will be sold, and the funds obtained will also be used for relief activities. The distribution of the funds will be based on the principle of national coverage. Any public or private constructive or relief projects that urgently need subsidies can submit detailed plans to the committee for review and allocation by the committee together with the US side. In order to plan relief work, the committee has also established health, medical, and social relief committees, inviting experts from both the US and China to participate, responsible for designing and reviewing plans requesting assistance from all parties.</p>

<h3>Tokyo War Crimes Trials, Individual Arguments Conclude, Court Hearings Nearly Three Thousand Hours, Creating an Unprecedented World Record, Dr. Mei Ru'ao Returns to China Arrives in Shanghai and Speaks</h3>
<p>Dr. Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese representative judge of the Far East Military Tribunal, returned to China from Tokyo on the 17th and arrived in Shanghai. The reporter visited him and inquired about the recent situation of the Tokyo war crimes trials. According to Mei, the Far East International Tribunal has been working very intensively since its resumption on August 4 last year. The court is held for five or six hours a day, not including the judges' meetings. Since the opening of the court in May of the previous year, the public trial has lasted for nearly three thousand hours in twenty months, and the court records have reached more than 38,000 pages, more than double that of the Nuremberg trials. It is truly an unprecedented record in the history of world justice. Since the beginning of the individual defense phase of the war criminals in early September last year, the work of the court has become more active, the mood has become more tense, and the world's interest in the long-silent Tokyo trials has become stronger, and the audience seats are full, especially when Tojo was tried. The individual defense of war criminals is in alphabetical order by their English surnames, from Araki to Umezu, and took a total of four and a half months. Among them, Tojo, Togo, and Oshima spent more than a week each, while the rest averaged about three days per person, and the shorter ones only took one day or half a day. Now the individual defense of these twenty-five Japanese Class A war criminals has been completed last week, and the Tokyo trial has come to a general conclusion, and it is approaching the end.</p>
<p>Final Debate to Be Held at the End of the Month</p>
<p>At this moment, both the prosecutors and the defendants are concentrating on carefully analyzing and reviewing all the evidence presented over the past twenty-odd months, as well as all relevant legal facts, making judgments, and preparing "comprehensive arguments" to be submitted to the court and read aloud at the "final debate court" to be held at the end of the month. After the end of the final debate court, the Tokyo public trial will come to an end, and the court will announce its closing. Then, judges from eleven countries will hold a deliberation meeting, determine the sentences, and draft the judgment, and then announce the sentence on a regular basis. This is the end of all the work of the Far East International Tribunal.</p>
<p>Participating in the Election Without Campaigning</p>
<p>The reporter asked Mei whether he would take the time to return to his hometown to participate in the election because he was nominated as a candidate for this year's Jiangxi legislator. Mei replied: I have been a legislator for fourteen years, and I have presided over the Foreign Affairs, Translation, and Foreign-related Legislation committees. I am willing to use my many years of experience to continue to serve the country in legislative work. However, domestic and foreign transportation is currently difficult, and the work in Tokyo is becoming increasingly tense and urgent. It is impossible for me to return to my hometown to campaign, but I still believe that the local voters will be able to elect the people they want to elect and should elect. As for personal gains and losses, I have no concerns. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight to report on his duties and is scheduled to fly to Japan on the 24th in order to participate in the unveiling of the final decisive scene of the Tokyo trial in time.</p>
<h3>Dance Schools Send Representatives to Nanjing to Appeal Again</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 29 dance schools in the city were ordered to close down because the government was practicing a frugality movement and have repeatedly petitioned the relevant departments, requesting that the order be revoked. The Municipal Council and the Municipal Party Department have agreed to forward their requests to the authorities for consideration. However, after the Executive Yuan's ban on dance orders and measures arrived here some days ago, it still stipulates that dance schools should be banned. The Dance School Friendship Association specially hosted the press yesterday, and representatives Zhou Yuehan and Bao Longyun explained respectively: Since dance schools do not violate the principle of frugality or train dancing girls, there seems to be no reason to order them to close. The famous American dance teacher Oshaman Lai was hired by the British Emperor to teach dance at the palace, and the British Dance Art Research Institute holds competitions every year, and the government also awards bonuses. It seems that the research of dance art should not be restricted. Finally, a dance film was shown, showing dance art. It is heard that the petitioning representatives are scheduled to enter Nanjing today to appeal to the Executive Yuan again.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association Establishes Rehabilitation Workshop</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's First Lung Hospital recently established a workshop at its Hongqiao Road Huaiyin Road location, named the "Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Rehabilitation Workshop." Its purpose is to provide a light work training program under the guidance of doctors for general pulmonary tuberculosis patients in the post-recovery stage, who are not strong enough to return to their original work. Patients are diagnosed and approved by a doctor (mainly based on multiple germ-free tests and normal temperature), and with their consent, they are given an appropriate amount of work, guided by experts. The working hours depend on the patient's physical strength and can be adjusted at any time. Doctors regularly examine the patients until their bodies have fully recovered and their working ability has returned to its original state. The advantages of this approach are: 1) patients can receive reasonable treatment until their health is restored; 2) patients can reduce their burden by earning income from work, thereby relieving their emotional anxiety; 3) they can learn a skill for self-reliance. However, the association is limited by its finances and hopes for assistance from all sectors of society so that it can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Case Against Senior Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Staff Scheduled for Trial, Seventeen Summoned</h3>

<h3>The Young Commander of the Jungar Banner, Major General Qi Zhizhong, and the Inside Story of the Mongol Banners</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Guisui, November 11] Ever since the Jungar Banner's security cavalry blocked the Communist bandits from crossing the Yellow River westward at Yulin when they were surrounded, and then recovered Fugou County, the 27-year-old Commander Qi Zhizhong has once again made the declining Yangjiawan, after fifteen years, a center of military affairs, politics, and wealth on the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan. At the same time, the Qi surname aristocratic family of Yangjiawan has regained in the minds of the Mongol and Han people the prominent position it had during the era of Qi Zhizhong's grandfather, Nasan Dalai. The Qi surname aristocratic family of Yangjiawan in Jungar Banner is one of the most extraordinary families in Suiyuan and Mongolia. The purpose of this reporter is to use the Qi surname power family of Yangjiawan and the young Commander Qi Zhizhong to recount the past political inside story of the Mongol Banners and explain the path that the Mongol Banners will take in the future.</p>
<p>Qi Zhizhong's family began to rise to prominence with his grandfather, Nasan Dalai. Although Nasan was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, he initially held no official position and belonged to a kind of idle prince who lived off his family's wealth. Therefore, he was very poor in his youth and had to serve as a soldier for the Zasag. Later, because Nasan was tall and brave in battle, he gained military power. During the era of Prince Ka, the grandfather of Qi Zhiguo, the Zasag of Jungar Banner who died of illness the year before last, he became the hereditary Zhenguo Duke Taiji and served as the most powerful Eastern Councilor of Jungar Banner. Therefore, the people in the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan called him "Lord Nasan," "Great Han Taiji," or "Great Han Official." After the death of Qi Zhiguo's father, Prince A, Nasan, as the Eastern Councilor, even took charge of the Zasag's seals, holding power from the 34th year of the Guangxu reign until the first month of the lunar calendar in the 21st year of the Republic (1932).</p>
<p>Major General Qi Zhizhong</p>
<p>After Nasan seized military and political power, he ushered in a new era for Jungar Banner. He carried out construction work in the three areas of military affairs, politics, and economy, showing more progressive style than the hereditary Zasag. Because Jungar Banner was separated from the two provinces of Qin (Shaanxi) and Jin (Shanxi) only by the Great Wall and the Yellow River, the Mongol people were completely Sinicized, allowing Nasan to invite impoverished scholars and frustrated military officers from Hequ and Fugou to reform the old policies, train new armies, and gain a leading position in the Yeke-juu League. Nasan's first wife was a Manchu lady. She open-mindedly allowed her son Qi Zijun to study in Beiping. Later, he graduated from Peking University and went to Kulun to study. When he returned, he asked the lamas of various temples to create a school to cultivate Mongol and Han children in the banner. At the same time, Shini Lama of Uushin Banner and Zhang Wenxuan of Otog Banner, who went to Outer Mongolia for training, were regarded as dangerous figures in the Yeke-juu League by the feudal princes.</p>
<p>Qi Zijun and his son made many welfare contributions to the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan during their lifetimes. In the early years of the Xuantong reign, there was a severe drought in northern Shaanxi. Nasan Dalai allocated 50,000 taels of silver for disaster relief and subsidized famine victims from Fugou and Shenmu to reclaim wasteland in Jungar Banner. This move not only increased the population of Jungar Banner by more than 100,000 but also created a landlord with 500 li of narrow land from Fugou to Salachi County. Therefore, during the Anti-Japanese War, Yangjiawan was able to supply General Ma Zhanshan's cavalry for as long as six years. After the Revolution of 1911, the world was in chaos. Nasan Dalai suppressed Su Yusheng's bandit gang that roamed in Hequ and Fugou. In 1927, Wang Ying, a bandit sent by the Fengtian warlords, feigned a passage through Jungar Banner to attack Hequ, Shanxi. Qi Zijun automatically set fire to Yangjiawan, creating a scorched earth. From then on, the bandits dared not enter the border of Jungar Banner again.</p>
<p>Nasan Dalai's many practices were deeply supported by the people but opposed by other officials. In order to achieve unification, he massacred many traitors in the banner, leaving behind the roots of hatred. At that time, a banner administrator named Altan Vazir strongly opposed Nasan. He was arrested by Nasan and died in prison. His son, Qi Shoushan, went to the Central Military Academy for training. After graduating, he did not dare to return to the banner and worked in the Military Training Department. In 1929, Qi Zijun, as a member of the National Government Supervisory Committee, went to Nanjing for a meeting. With a broad mind, he brought Qi Shoushan back to Jungar Banner. Nasan asked Qi Shoushan to train soldiers and Qi Zijun to govern, and he opened the four towns of Shagedu, Nalin, Wuzhiwan, and Nuanshui into commercial ports, giving Qi Shoushan a lot of property, wanting to build Jungar Banner into a model Mongol banner. Unexpectedly, Qi Shoushan, incited by opposing figures in the banner, killed Qi Zijun and his son on the first day of the first month of the 21st year (1932) when he came to Yangjiawan to pay New Year's greetings, claiming to avenge his father, thus thwarting Nasan Dalai's heroic ambitions.</p>
<p>Nasan Dalai's Portrait</p>
<p>After Qi Shoushan killed Qi Zijun and his son, Erjubaigan, Nasan Dalai's battalion commander (who was assassinated last year), killed Qi Shoushan and replaced Nasan Dalai's military and political position. Qi Wenying and his grandson Qi Yongquan served as Eastern and Western Councilors, respectively. In addition to managing the Zasag's seals, Qi Wenying also held the two military seals of the Jungar Banner Security Commander and the First Guerrilla District Commander of Mongolia, with even greater power than Nasan Dalai. Qi Zhizhong, the successor of Qi Zijun and his son, was only twelve years old after his grandfather and uncle were killed. Qi Wenying took Nasan Dalai's army to Shenchu (Qi Wenying's residence), leaving only a group of home guards to guard the fields in Yangjiawan. After Qi Zhizhong was raised and educated by his grandmother, he used his own property to recruit troops and horses, and by the time the Anti-Japanese War began, he had expanded into a regiment of strong cavalry in six or seven years.</p>
<p>This offspring of a noble family first appeared on the political stage of Jungar Banner on the day he assisted Qi Zhiguo, the son of Prince A, in using his seal. After Prince A died of illness, his son's seal affairs had been managed by Nasan Dalai and Qi Wenying. By 1941, Qi Zhiguo had reached the legal age for his title and was very handsome and promising. However, Qi Wenying was unwilling to hand over the seal, so Qi Zhiguo united Qi Zhizhong of Yangjiawan and Qi Shangbin (the current Eastern Councilor of Jungar Banner), the grandson of Danpianer, the Eastern Councilor of Prince Ka who was killed by General Yigu during the Qianlong reign, and other young people. After Ma Zhanshan sent troops to suppress the situation, he transferred the Jungar royal seal from Shenshan to the Deshengxi palace. From then on, Qi Zhizhong became a pillar of the new regime of Jungar Banner, and Qi Wenying of Shenshan formed two new forces in Jungar Banner. Before Japan surrendered, Qi Zhiguo died of illness. Qi Zhizhong led his troops away from Deshengxi to assist General Ma Zhanshan in defending Hequ, and together with Qi Shangbin of Nanping, Qi Wenying divided Jungar Banner into two regions, east and west. After Japan surrendered, General Ma Zhanshan led his troops away from the Yeke-juu League, leaving him many cadres and weapons. The strength of Yangjiawan became even more prosperous.</p>
<p>Last summer, Qi Wenying was assassinated by assassins sent by Qi Zixiang, the nephew of Qi Fengming, the former Western Councilor of his grandson Qi Yongquan. Qi Zhizhong immediately sent troops from Yangjiawan to disarm the rebel army, so that the entire banner did not experience any disturbances. The provincial government immediately announced that he would succeed Qi Wenying as the Jungar Banner Security Commander. Later, the Banner Affairs Committee was established, with Qi Yongquan, Qi Wenying's grandson, serving as the chairman, and Qi Zhizhong concurrently serving as a member and head of the finance section. The Banner Affairs Committee replaced the former royal palace. Because Qi Zhizhong had the masses and wealth, he had a strong political capital, so now Yangjiawan has become the center of military affairs, politics, and wealth on the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan. This year, in addition to sending troops to recover Fugou, Qi Zhizhong also carried out a task of eradicating feudal forces. The facts of the matter are as follows: After Qi Wenying was assassinated, the Banner Affairs Committee established in Jungar Banner was opposed by the princes of various banners of the Yeke-juu League. Without the permission of the provincial government, the King directly recommended Qi Shangbin, the grandson of Danpianer Taiji, to the central government to succeed Qi Wenying as the Eastern Councilor of Jungar Banner, and recommended Qi Fuhai, a close relative of Qi Zhiguo, as the Zasag. In order to overthrow the princely system, Qi Zhizhong took advantage of Qi Shangbin's trip to the Junwang Banner in May of this year and completely resolved Qi Shangbin's army with lightning speed, trapping Qi Shangbin and Qi Fuhai in Guisui, and they have not been able to return to the Deshengxi palace to take over the seals.</p>
<p>Qi Zijun's Portrait</p>
<p>With the Communist bandits constantly encroaching on the northern border, the position of Commander Qi Zhizhong is becoming increasingly important. There are now four major groups in Jungar Banner. In addition to Qi Zhizhong of Yangjiawan, there is Qi Yongquan of Shenshan, Qi Zhiguo's mother in Deshengxi, Qi Fuhai and Qi Shangbin, who are exiled in Guisui, and Qi Zixiang of the Qi Zixiang, one of the three sons of the Hetao gang of Jungar Banner. Qi Yongquan is currently the Chairman of the Banner Affairs Committee and holds the three cavalry regiments left by his grandfather Qi Wenying, which have been reorganized into the First Border Defense District Commander. However, his prestige is not as good as Qi Zhizhong's, his wealth is not as good as Qi Zhizhong's, and his cadres are not as strong as Qi Zhizhong's. Therefore, the mother of Zasag Qi Zhiguo only has a household army. Qi Fuhai, the puppet prince who attempts to rule from behind the curtain, and the regent Qi Shangbin are temporarily unable to return to the banner, and the regimental commander Hao Deming has a very close relationship with Qi Zhizhong. Qi Zixiang was arrested and released in the Qi Wenying case and is currently leading troops to suppress bandits in Chahar Province, unable to return to the banner to intervene in internal affairs. Therefore, the governance of Jungar Banner and the safety of the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan in the future will depend greatly on the decisive role of Qi Zhizhong.</p>
<p>Although Commander Qi Zhizhong is a Mongol, he does not understand the Mongol language and speaks a mixture of Han Chinese from Hequ and Fugou counties. He has not attended modern schools, but he has a good foundation in the Four Books and Five Classics, and his conversation is very elegant. Due to reading newspapers, he is quite knowledgeable. Qi Zhizhong has the bearing of a noble offspring. He said, "I only believe in two people, Chairman Jiang and Chief Fu. I also listen to the words of the elders of General Ma." He believes that the mutual killing in Jungar Banner is the biggest trauma to the Mongol banners, and the only way to avoid it in the future is to implement democracy. He said, "Now the central government is constantly implementing constitutional government, why does it still allow the princely system to exist in the Mongol banners? It really makes it impossible for us to explain." Speaking of the issue of Inner Mongolia's autonomy, Commander Qi Zhizhong said affirmatively: "We have already implemented autonomy, what is lacking now is progress." (Reporter Liu Yingyuan)</p>
<h3>Giant Plane Crashes, Sounding Like Thunder</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Kaifeng, November 13] Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, a huge sound like thunder was suddenly heard west of the city, shaking the roofs and tiles. It has been learned that a large transport plane suddenly crashed and burned near Hanzhuang Station, west of Kaifeng on the Longhai Railway, and a violent explosion occurred.</p>
<p>Another report: In the middle of the previous ten-day period, the Pinghan Railway was destroyed by bandits, resulting in heavy losses of railway equipment. In addition to ticket cars, freight cars, and all equipment, 20 locomotives have been destroyed, including three that transferred from the Longhai Railway. These were newly purchased from the United States.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou Hawker Incident Likely to Be Resolved Quickly</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhengzhou correspondent on the 14th] Due to the authorities' attention to public order and traffic issues in Zhengzhou, a hawker incident has recently occurred. Near Changchun Road, there is a small market that serves as a gathering place for hawkers. Currently, the Zhenxing Commercial Market is being established near Qiantang Road. In order to beautify the city and facilitate management, the authorities ordered the hawkers from the small market to move to the Zhenxing Commercial Market. The hawkers there have petitioned the garrison headquarters, police station, and other agencies eight times, requesting permission to operate in the open space near the small market. Their reasons are: The distance between the small market and the Zhenxing Commercial Market is five or six *li*. Since they are located near the small market, moving back and forth every day would be time-consuming and costly. There are currently more than 600 hawker households in the small market, while the Zhenxing Commercial Market can only accommodate more than 400 households. Furthermore, the rental prices in the Zhenxing Commercial Market are too expensive for the hawkers to afford. It is said that most of the hawkers there are old refugees from northern Henan. When the Japanese invaded northern Henan, they fled to the Jieshou area to make a living, and have now gradually come to Zhengzhou for one or two years, and their situation is indeed quite difficult. The authorities seem to have considered changing their handling methods for this issue, and this incident may be resolved peacefully.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Seizes Stored Grain, Bans Hoarding and Profiteering</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiangyin correspondent on the 17th] This county has always been known as a rice-producing area, but recently rice prices have been even higher than in Shanghai and Wuxi. *Bai geng* rice has reached 1.45 million [currency unit], and the common people are constantly complaining. The county government convened a meeting of grain merchants on the 16th, and as a result, they decided to seal up the stored grain in various villages, ban hoarding and profiteering. The guild has set the price of *zhong bai geng hai shi* rice at 1.35 million [currency unit], and secondary rice at 1.3 million [currency unit], with a limit of one *dou* for door-to-door sales.</p>
<h3>The "Omnipotent Lens" - A Glimpse of the Criminal Investigation Laboratory's Equipment</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing correspondent on the 12th] In modern times, criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their techniques. The authorities must rely on scientific equipment and technological coordination in order to collect and identify criminal evidence and achieve the task of maintaining social stability. During this period of suppressing rebellion, building the nation, and eradicating opium, the responsibility of the criminal police is even more onerous. The Criminal Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior is located in Nanjing, and is setting an example for police work nationwide in terms of equipment, personnel, and organization. The headquarters has taken over various equipment from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization and established a criminal laboratory, which is divided into ten groups: chemistry, fingerprinting, photography, forensic medicine, technology, electrical, firearms examination, supply, police dogs, and carrier pigeons. All the instruments are of considerable value. This newspaper has previously introduced them in an article. In order to give readers a better understanding of their contents, we are now publishing a collection of photographs taken by the World Photography News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Models: The application of models in criminology is to supplement the shortcomings of photography in identifying or investigating criminal evidence.</p>
<p>Lie Detector: Based on the psychological reaction of the electrical charge in the human body. When used, the polygraph operator first discusses the questions. Then, the respiration belt and pulse tester are tied to the subject's left arm, and the skin resistance tester is placed on the palm of the left hand. Then, the subject is instructed to sit properly. The testing method is divided into two types, which must be used together: one is a controlled test, and the other is a test of questions related to the case. The average percentage of its effectiveness depends on the experience and knowledge of the polygraph operator, usually above 75%.</p>
<p>"Omnipotent Lens": This instrument is produced by the German WELTE factory. Its structure is divided into four parts: slicing, microscopic, comparative, and photomicrography. It can inspect transparent and opaque objects and is an important tool for criminal identification.</p>
<p>Two-Way Radio Telephone and Telegraph: This machine can be used to transmit and receive radio telephone and telegraph messages, and is specially used for communication, liaison, and command. The communication distance can reach tens of *hua li*.</p>
<p>Burglar Alarm: Used for burglar alarms and security. The electrical device of the alarm bell is used to control its shutter button, which can simultaneously take photos to provide evidence of people passing through the security line.</p>
<p>Diesel Generator: Specially used for supplying electricity for the鉴定 work of various instruments, so it is called a power control machine.</p>
<h3>One Dance Captivates, A Second Dance Seals the Deal: "Hero and Beauty" in Yangzhou – Both Arrested and Taken to the County Office</h3>
<p>[Report from our Yangzhou correspondent on the 14th] A case of impersonating a military officer occurred here a few days ago. Because the incident was bizarre, it quickly spread far and wide, causing a city-wide sensation. Recently, a handsome young man wearing a military uniform and the insignia of a major general was often seen strolling the streets of Yangzhou with a heavily made-up young woman. Especially in teahouses and restaurants, the guests all cast envious glances at this dazzling "major general." However, time flies quickly, and more than ten days have passed, but this "hero and beauty" are still leisurely wandering the streets, doing nothing, which has attracted the attention of the police. It was found that the "major general" was named Wang Huanwen, 28 years old, from Weixian County, Shandong Province, and the woman was "Mrs." Wan, named Chen Liping, living together at No. 11, Jiuhao, in the old city. Unexpectedly, Wang "major general" was bored after eating his fill all day, so he often invited nearby laborers to visit Zhucheng [a local pleasure district], wearing a starched military uniform and enjoying himself at the same table as those who were barefoot and naked, fully demonstrating his "democratic style" and "military-civilian cooperation." After the police station obtained this information, Officer Cheng resolutely joined the game. During the chat, he saw through the trick in Wang "major general"'s sleeve. The next day, when investigating household registrations, he found two forged travel certificates from the Second Pacification Zone Headquarters, an identity card, four private seals of Commander Wang Yaowu, two Victory Medals, and twenty rounds of ammunition for a rifle in his bedroom. At this point, the secret was revealed, and Wang "major general" and Chen Liping were "escorted" to the police station. After interrogation, Wang Huanwen confessed that he was also known as "Wang Hui" and "Sheng Bin," and did not deny the forgery of documents and the Wang Yaowu private seals. He also said that he had already issued two forged documents and traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai in the past, and had recently come to Yangzhou with his wife for a short stay. According to Chen Liping's confession, she used to be a dancer at the MGM dance hall in Shanghai. Because she was captivated by Wang's elegance, one dance captivated her, and a second dance sealed the deal. She began living with Wang in the tenth month of the lunar calendar and was unaware of Wang's identity and family background. Her current life depends entirely on his selling gold jewelry. When she spoke, her eyebrows were furrowed, as if she was overwhelmed by the regret of her misstep. After obtaining the confessions, the police station, fearing that the case involved other suspects, transferred the "hero and beauty" to the county government for investigation and detention, and they will soon be tasting the flavor of iron bars.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Stipulates Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang correspondent on the 17th] Recently, in order to solve the people's food problems and stabilize the people's hearts, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in addition to suggesting that the central government quickly seek countermeasures, has specially formulated measures to stabilize grain prices as follows: Strictly enforce the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Crimes Against Grain Price Management in Extraordinary Times." When necessary, the grain stored in each county and city will be subject to price requisition of surplus grain in accordance with the provisions of the regulations, and grain merchants will be advised to sell surplus grain on the market. Strictly control the grain market and strictly investigate and ban grain merchants from transacting grain. Strictly register the entry and exit of rice, and for those who purchase rice in large quantities, the purpose and destination should be investigated. Guide idle funds into production industries to avoid disturbing the grain market. The relevant counties and cities have been ordered to strictly follow these measures.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Cuba: From Servants to Leaders</h3>
<p>[Report from our Cuba correspondent on the 13th] Minister Mei Jingzhou recently wrote an article describing the great achievements of overseas Chinese in Cuba, which was published in the *China World Daily* of Havana and has attracted the attention of readers. The full text is translated as follows: It has been a full century since Chinese people came to live in Cuba. They were very poor at first and worked hard. They also fought for freedom. From farmhands to wealthy merchants, their rapid progress is amazing.</p>
<p>When Chinese people first arrived in Cuba, they worked as servants. The locals called them Chinese from Little Luzon, because they all came from that place. Only a few had experience in farming. At that time, agriculture in the Philippines was not very developed, and the trade in African black slaves was more profitable. These Chinese people had already learned Spanish and were largely assimilated into Spanish culture. The second wave of immigrants were from Fujian, who were recruited by Spaniards from Little Luzon, mostly "Hakka." They were regarded as non-native people in their hometowns, and were eager to go abroad due to oppression. A small number of them were Christians. From 1847 onwards, this continued for ten years. We Chinese people are all good workers, and were exploited by the Spanish. The immigration of Chinese workers to Cuba from 1847 to 1877 lasted for thirty years. After the prohibition of the black slave trade, they were transported here to replace them.</p>
<p>Wahluwitt wrote: "Since there was a shortage of workers, it was necessary to find workers to replace the black slaves. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants thought of transporting Chinese people under the guise of hired laborers. Thus, black slaves were transformed into Chinese slaves, and the inhuman treatment they received was even worse." In order to prevent the Chinese from regaining their freedom after their contracts expired, the Spanish made them sign contracts voluntarily relinquishing their rights.</p>
<p>Chinese people are naturally able to work hard in difficult circumstances, which is also the root of trouble. The famous author Quiros found that black people often died from working in the vast tobacco, sugar, and cotton plantations, while Chinese people could thrive in the harsh tropical environment. This unfortunate environment made them yearn for liberation and a thorough improvement in political and social aspects. Therefore, during the Cuban independence movement, they showed remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>Many Chinese people were abducted and sold in Macau, falsely told that they were being transported to Little Luzon, but in fact they were sent to Greater Luzon (the collective name for Spain and its colonies). The voyage across the Pacific Ocean was quite long, and riots and plagues often occurred on board. Sometimes only 30% of them were able to reach their destination. If 50% survived, it was considered a smooth voyage. They were paid eight yuan a month, and had to pay for their own passage and food along the way.</p>
<p>The situation in Cuba at that time was even more terrifying. When they arrived, it was during General Otoniel's social unrest and dictatorship. After landing, they were sent to Yunton Province to build new sugar mills. Most of them were considered "tools".</p>
<p>The Sino-Spanish Agreement was thought to be a way to improve the situation. The Spanish consul in Guangzhou and Macau, Saint Wilnouwa, worked hard to draft the charter. Subsequently, other amended charters were introduced, such as the 1861 decree, which was the result of the efforts of the Chinese residing in Cuba. From the start of the Cuban Revolution on October 10, 1868, until the First War of Independence, bribery in the colony reached its peak. General Turusi wanted to stop it, but was forced to resign. During General Roja's tenure, there was even more speculation, and even contracts for Chinese workers were traded. The Chinese government lodged a strong protest. During the tenure of Count Palumasitta, the Chinese who were forced to work in fortifications in Hugaro and Mauron rose up in resistance and joined the revolutionary army. Other Chinese fled into the forests. They often appeared in the wars in Camagüey, eastern provinces, Las Villas, and Yunton. As a result, the Chinese who remained working in the forts were even more abused. Because the Chinese participated in the 1873 war and were exploited, the Qing Dynasty sent the famous Chen Lanbin to negotiate in Cuba (1874). The only impression Chen left on Havana was his personal prominence and demeanor. Ladu described in his "Essentials of the History of Chinese People in Cuba" how Chen was warmly received and won the hearts of the Cuban people. Chen's achievements in alleviating the suffering of overseas Chinese were very limited, but the Madrid Treaty was initiated as a result, so Chen's trip was not without merit (Cuba, Havana). The Cuban side has many detailed records of the achievements of overseas Chinese in participating in the Ten Years' War. Kesada wrote in his book "Chinese People and Cuban Independence," "Among the Chinese soldiers, there were no spies or deserters." This book has recently been reprinted.</p>
<p>The participation of the Chinese in the war was so important that when the Cubans surrendered to the Spanish on February 10, 1878, they demanded the addition of a clause that would allow the Chinese to enjoy the rights of amnesty and liberation, which was finally approved. Later, during Blanco's tenure, the Chinese Consulate in Havana was established and regulations were promulgated to abolish the labor contracts. These Chinese then engaged in commerce and the cultivation of sugarcane and fruits. When the war broke out in 1895, the overseas Chinese joined the army again to help Cuba fight for freedom. Those who are immortalized in the history of the War of Independence include Colonel Hu and Colonel Laihua, who are highly respected by the Cuban people. After this war, Cuba became an independent republic. The overseas Chinese joined forces to participate in the Cuban reconstruction work. Many of them had ample savings, but lost everything during these difficult times, and could not return to their home country, so they settled here. Today, they lead in many industries. The economic and social status of our Chinese people is steadily increasing and becoming more prosperous. Some of their descendants have even held important positions in the Cuban government. Their academic achievements are even better than their ancestors, and they are able to contribute to the development of Cuba's future and the promotion of friendship between China and Cuba. In short, the history of Chinese people in Cuba is 100 years long. The most outstanding point is their transformation from farmhands to wealthy merchants. Despite the difficulties of language, culture, environment, and ethnicity, our Chinese people were able to overcome difficulties with gentleness, accept adversity with grace, endure hardship, and strive hard, and finally achieve victory. From farmers and workers to merchants, and from merchants to leaders, this three-stage process is a process of valuable contributions made by our Chinese people to Cuba. (Pei Mei)</p>
<h3>Prosecutor Investigates Qingzhong Case</h3>

<h3>Bizarre Fetus in Beiping - Gestated for Twelve Years</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping correspondent on the 15th] The Beiping Municipal Hospital previously treated a woman for uterine fibroids and performed surgery on the 7th of this month. They discovered a hard, bizarre object adhering to the patient's colon above her uterus. After detailed examination, they determined it to be an underdeveloped four-month-old fetus. After the news spread, a reporter visited a certain doctor, the director of obstetrics at the hospital, who agreed to show the entire bizarre fetus (as shown in the picture). The head is 7 cm in diameter, the total length is 14 cm, and the limbs, spine, and ribs are faintly visible. The whole body is cyanotic and purple. There are still several strands of hair on the skull, and it has been gestating for twelve years. The bizarre fetus has already become petrified. According to the doctor in charge of the case, this type of bizarre fetus is not unprecedented. According to medical records, there have been cases of gestation for 20 or even more than 20 years, but it is rare in the domestic medical field. After X-ray examination, the internal skeletal structure of the bizarre fetus was found to be very complete.</p>

<h3>Eastern European Inside Story</h3>
<p>— Sapei Keng</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our London Correspondent] The "unhappy ending" of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London reflects the contradictions between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union on the European continent. Control of the Eastern European countries is the Soviet Union's advanced base for intervening in Germany and Austria and concerning France and Italy, as well as one of the Soviet Union's important assets in participating in world politics. These so-called Eastern European countries mainly include Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, which are usually considered to be countries within the Soviet Union's "Iron Curtain." Since they have the nickname "Iron Curtain," it is conceivable that they are not easy to understand. However, the outer edge of the "Iron Curtain" is ultimately different from the core of the "Iron Curtain." Therefore, we can still know something, and it is very necessary to know something today.</p>
<p>Let's start with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria: since the beginning of this year (1947), the governments of both countries have been under the control of the Communist Party, and the opposition parties have no power to speak of. The main policies of the governments of the two countries under the control of the Communist Party are how to eliminate the remaining elements of the opposition party and how to isolate the people of their own country from contact with foreigners (the so-called foreign countries here naturally refer to countries not controlled by the Communist Party). According to this policy, it is natural to greatly increase the use of prisons. To give the main examples, in Yugoslavia, Professor Fang Lan, a liberal, was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Yefenfei was sentenced to nine years in prison; in Bulgaria, such as the execution of Bokov and the life imprisonment of Stankiv. These prison sentences were generally due to these people's usual contacts with Western European people, or criticism of communism in parliamentary speeches or private conversations.</p>
<p>The situation in Romania is similar. Although the government is of a "united" nature, the Peasant Party, as the opposition party in the government, is not only oppressed, but its leaders, including Meng Niu, who was arrested not long ago, have been sentenced to long-term imprisonment. The other two parties participating in the coalition government—the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party—have been purged because their opinions differ from those of the Communist Party. The Socialist Party was forced to merge with other "workers' parties," while the Liberal Party was forced to withdraw from the government by a vote of no confidence in the parliament.</p>
<p>The situation in Poland and Hungary is slightly different from the above three countries in degree. The leader of the Polish Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, recently fled to England and has gone to the United States, and a dozen other people have been arrested. However, the Polish Socialist Party, which participates in the Polish government, is still struggling to maintain its "independence" and has not merged with other parties. Hungary is also considered by the Communist Party to be somewhat short of "true democracy." The Smallholder's Party, which is quite powerful in Hungary, is now in fact under the control of the Communist Party. However, there are still three parties in the Hungarian coalition government, occupying about one-third of the seats in parliament, which are considered right-leaning. One of them, the "Hungarian Independence Party," has been suppressed, and its leader, Feifei, has also left the country. In the Polish government, the Socialist Party is still supporting its nominal "independence." Its leader, Szakasit, recently gave a speech against merging with other parties, but how long he can support it is also a question.</p>
<p>The most important country is Czechoslovakia, which is probably the country with the greatest political freedom and the gradual restoration of the rule of law among the Eastern European countries, and the degree to which it is controlled by the Communist Party is also slightly less. However, in July of this year, the Czechoslovak government was in fact forced to abandon the invitation to the Paris Conference at the last second. Since then, the Communist Party and its "fellow travelers" have been strengthening their efforts to force the Czechoslovak government to the left. The five-year plan announced by the Czechoslovak government in October is an economic transformation to sever Czechoslovakia's relations with Western countries. The current strategy of the Communist Party seems to be how to occupy a majority in the parliament in order to overthrow the parties of the National Front that have been in Czechoslovakia since the end of the war.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it can be seen that the situation in the Eastern European countries can be roughly divided into two parts: one part is Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Romania. These three countries are in fact one-party dictatorship countries, that is, countries controlled by the Communist Party. The other part is Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Although these three countries are threatened by the Communist Party, they can still contact Western European countries at present. However, this situation is only superficial and may be short-lived, because the actual power of the Communist Party can be controlled. Due to Czechoslovakia's refusal to participate in the Paris Conference (it initially agreed to participate but was forced to refuse temporarily), the Polish Peasant Party leader's escape (this would not be necessary in a truly democratic country), and the Hungarian Independence Party leader's departure from the country, it is conceivable. As for when the Communist Party will organize a one-party government in these countries, it probably depends on their assessment of the international situation, which is a matter of the Communist Party's strategy. Of course, there is also a possibility here, that is, to overcome the current crisis with the national consciousness of the people of Czechoslovakia and Poland, but today, the power of this possibility is very difficult to estimate.

Representatives from the city party headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Bureau of Education attended the meeting. Chairman Jiang Dongcheng reported on the purpose of the meeting and the preparation process. Then, biologist Dr. Xu Yudao gave a speech on "Biology Science Education," stating briefly: Modern material science research began in the 18th century, while biological science began in the 19th century. All research related to "life" and "physiological" theories belongs to the scope of biology. In the future, biology teachers should understand four points: Firmly adhere to their own positions. China needs a biology textbook that forms its own system, from bottom to top, and is suitable for the needs of domestic agriculture, medicine, and all aspects of society. When teaching biology, one should have a scientific and truthful spirit and correct all distortions that have an effect, such as when Hitler used German biologists to advocate the theory of national excellence and exclude Jews based on the theory of "survival of the fittest" and launched a war. We must be vigilant against such distortions. When studying biology, special attention should be paid to experimental research. Techniques such as microscopes, microtomes, and drawing should be earnestly learned. It must be known that all book theories are based on experiments. The future development of agriculture in China has much to do with biological research. Often explain to young students the relationship between biology and real life. Later, directors and supervisors were elected: Jiang Dongcheng, Sun Zhenzhong, Lu Shimei, Wang Zhengui, Lu Xinqiu, Ji Lianjin, Huang Ruzhen, Wang Xuanzhi, Qu Qiubai, Yuan Shanwei, Liu Songquan and others were elected as directors; Sun Zheng, Song Yingxiong, and Li Zhishen were elected as supervisors.

<h3>The Yiyuan All-Star Game Ends in a Tie; The Second Inter-Port Football Test Match Ends in a 1-1 Draw</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The weather was warm, and all the heroes gathered at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon. The football representatives selected for the inter-port match held the second test match. Thirty Chinese and Western players appeared on the field, still divided into blue and white teams. The result was a 1-1 draw, and the victory was not divided. There was no record in the first half. Eight or nine thousand fans attended, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Blue Attacks, White Defends</p>
<p>The lineup of the blue and white teams was arranged with the blue team attacking more than defending and the white team defending more than attacking. The first half was tense and exciting, but the movement became scattered after the changes in the second half. The blue team's forwards, led by the blonde Robert Stoffer, were extremely active, forcing the white team's defenders and center backs to retreat to defend, resulting in a battle of blue attack and white defense. As a result, the white team's center backs and forwards were disconnected, and with Luo Shoufu's weakness, the white team's forwards seemed to have difficulty developing. Among the blue team's defenders, the center back line was quite good, and Tievoni was able to stand alone.</p>
<p>No Score Recorded in the First Half</p>
<p>White Team: Zhang Banglun, Chen Jiawan, Wu Qixiang, Hannibal, Qu Yongfu, Gao Baozheng, Carlo Lieque, Luo Shoufu, Han Longhai, Li Yishen, Chen Mingzhe</p>
<p>Blue Team: Qin Bigao, F. Hertz, Zhang Lingen, Edward, Tievoni, Murray He, Jin Lusheng, Robert Stoffer, Xia Tixian, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Referee: Zhang Le; Linesmen: Wu Shouheng, Deng Xiaoliang. The white team wore the red jerseys of the Donghua Association, and the blue team wore the cyan-white jerseys of the Qingbai Association. The lineup was as above, and the game began with the whistle. The blue team attacked first. After three minutes, Xia Tixian got the ball and shot, but Zhang Banglun missed. Just as Little Huangmao was about to kick, Chen Jiawan cleared the ball and saved it. Not long after, Jin Lusheng shot from the left corner, but it flew into the sky. After twelve minutes, Chen Mingzhe cut in from the right corner of the white team, and the ball landed in front of the blue team's goal, but Carlo Lieque was one step late. Carlo Lieque returned and passed to the center, and Longhai headed the ball, but Tai Bigao hugged it. In the melee until the 30th minute, Edward of the blue team was near the 20-yard area outside the goal. Li Yishen took the free kick, but it did not work. Chen Mingzhe knocked on the door again, but Qin Bigao was waiting for him. Xia Tixian of the blue team shot fiercely in front of the white team's goal, but it bounced off the crossbar. The first half ended with a double zero.</p>
<p>1-1 Draw in the Second Half</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, the lineups of the two teams changed, arranged as follows:</p>
<p>Blue Team: Qin Bigao, Hertz, F. Grifi Ke, Edward, Qian Changrong, Tievoni, Murray He, Luo Shoufu, Robert Stoffer</p>
<p>White Team: Zhang Banglun, Risberg, Chen Jiawan, Li Yishen, Hannibal, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Carlo Lieque, Grina Si, Gao Xiuqing</p>
<p>The white team attacked first. The two teams went back and forth and fought for a long time. After twelve minutes, Xia Tixian was extremely active, and with a fierce shot, he broke the white team's goal first. The white team counterattacked with all its strength. After two minutes, Qian Changrong hand-kissed the ball in the penalty area. Li Yishen sent a light 12-yard penalty, but it was just in Qin Bigao's arms and failed to succeed. At the 17th minute, Chen Jiawan left the field due to a foot injury, and Risberg replaced him, and Li Yishen moved to the left. After that, the battle became more intense. In the 33rd minute, Gao Baozheng injured his foot again, and Lu Bingsheng replaced him. Qian Changrong of the blue team retired, and Tievoni became a midwife again. Seven minutes before the end of the game, Grina Si scored with a long shot, and the white team tied the score 1-1. The silver horn sounded, and each rice divided the victory.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Chenyou basketball team created a surprise upset in last night's basketball league, defeating the perennial champion Dagong team by a valuable one point, with a final score of 51-50. In the first half, Chenyou was behind by four points, 25-29. Over a thousand fans were astonished. Chenyou, young and strong, worked hard in training. Their performance last night was indeed very impressive. They previously lost to Wulian by one point, but yesterday they defeated Dagong by one point, which does not seem to be accidental. Wang Bingfu's shots were excellent, hitting the mark with ease, like a divine assistant. Dagong was perhaps a little overconfident and found themselves in a tough battle. They were overly nervous, their performance was abnormal, and they ultimately suffered a crushing defeat, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Liu Hesheng and Jin Bowen officiated. Chenyou's Wang Bingfu opened the scoring. Dagong's Shi Wei took the lead with 11-2. Chenyou counterattacked and gradually closed the gap. The situation was extremely tense. At the end of the first half, Chenyou was still behind by four points, 25-29.</p>
<p>Resuming play, Dagong's lineup remained unchanged. Chenyou brought in Ji Youkun, replaced Wang Rongsheng, and Jiu Quan made the first basket. Wenzhang immediately responded. Chenyou's He Zengling made a basket in the air, tying the score at 31-31. Dagong calmly coped, but the situation was extremely tense, and the scores went up and down, with each team vying for the lead. Chenyou's Little Wang shot accurately from afar, scoring repeatedly. At 47-41, Dagong was in a tough battle and called a timeout four times to discuss countermeasures. At 51-45, Dagong called for a timeout for the fifth time. Wenlong scored on a free throw, Wenhua scored from afar, and Zhongqiang broke through to score, 51-50, closing the gap to just half a point. With tens of seconds left before the end of the game, Dagong was overly nervous, and Chenyou called a timeout for the sixth time. During the free throws, Wenzhang and Wenhua both missed. Otherwise, they could have tied the score and still had a chance. Before long, time ran out, and Chenyou won by 51-50, by one point.</p>
<p>The other two games last night: Qianxian defeated Qingqiu (Women's), 47-26; Jianle defeated Tongren (B-2), 66-37.</p>
<h3>Selecting Representatives for Inter-City Football Match: Final Trials This Week, Blue and White Teams to Face Off Again on Sunday</h3>
<p>After two trial matches for the city's inter-city football team, the selection committee members Rong Qizhao, Yu Hengzhi, Wang Xinheng, and Tan Jing held a meeting at the Meixin Restaurant last night. Because there were many candidates and the two trial matches were not enough to showcase their skills, it was decided to hold a final trial match this weekend (the 25th), after which the official representatives would be selected. The lineups for the blue and white teams were also arranged on the spot as follows:</p>
<p>Blue Team: Zhang Banglun, Li Yichen, Wu Qixiang, Hannibo, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Jin Lusheng, Sun Jinshun (Captain), Robert Stoff, Xia Tixian, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>White Team: Xu Fusheng, Chen Jiawan, Xu Erz, Edward Qu Yongfu, McLeroth, Li Yao, Grinas, Han Longhai (Captain), Lu Qingxiang, Carlolequi</p>
<p>(Reserves): Qin Bigao, Griffiths, Lesburg, Lu Bingsheng, Tiffeni, Run Xiuqing, Chen Ming</p>

<h3>Amidst Tightening Credit, Check Returns Increase Again: Authorities Continue Thorough Investigation of Financial Management</h3>
<p>Amidst tightening credit, the number of returned checks has increased again recently. Financial management authorities continue to send personnel to conduct thorough investigations of returned checks. It is understood that the authorities have decided to implement the "Measures to Strengthen Financial Business Management." If the amount of returned checks from a commercial bank or money shop at the clearing house exceeds 5% of the total amount cleared by that bank or money shop on that day for three consecutive times, and it is found that the returned checks are clearly used as an excuse to balance the clearing difference, the local financial management agency may set a time limit to order the adjustment of the position. Additionally, local banks and money shops will be ordered to suspend lending to the bank within the time limit.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Should Report Loan and Remittance Amounts to the Financial Management Bureau</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and other four locations has been established successively. In addition to the monthly statements and loan target classifications that commercial banks, trust companies, and provincial and municipal banks are required to prepare at the end of each month, it is learned that the Ministry of Finance has separately ordered a remittance report form to be created, starting in January 1948, to be submitted to the respective management bureaus for verification. The external business units of all state-owned banks and treasuries (except the Central Bank) within the jurisdiction should not only prepare monthly statements and loan target classification forms, but also follow the provisions of Item B of Article 2 of the Measures to Strengthen Financial Business Control. They must prepare a list of all loan and remittance amounts handled on that day, item by item, according to the place name, and submit it to the respective management bureaus for review.</p>
<h3>Wheat Purchase and Milling Contract</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food has commissioned five major flour mills in this city, namely Fuxin, Fufeng, Maoxin, Huafeng, and Yutong, to purchase wheat and mill it to supply food to various places. A total of 1.7 million dan of wheat has been received in the first phase, and 1.2 million dan has been milled so far, producing approximately 1.8 million bags of flour. It is learned that the Ministry of Food has recently renewed the second-phase wheat purchase and milling contract with major flour mills, planning to purchase 300,000 dan of wheat. The wheat payment will be made by the Agricultural Bank of China as it is received. According to the Joint Wheat Purchasing Office, the office has already purchased over 100,000 dan. However, due to current transportation difficulties and scarce sources, the wheat purchasing work is difficult to carry out quickly.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Resolves to Petition for Opening of Industrial Loans</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th), the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city and six cities and counties, including Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Changshu, Jiangyin, held the ninth representative conference at the Wenqi Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School in Minhang. More than eighty representatives attended, including Wang Hairun from Wuxi, Cha Binchu from Wujin, Ma Chunlin from Wuxian, Xu Zhibin from Changshu, Xu Shunnian from Jiangyin, and Pan Shihao, Que Pingzhi, and Wang Shaojun from Shanghai. After discussing the proposals, the following resolutions were made: 1. Petition the government to open year-end emergency industrial loans; 2. Petition the Flower Yarn and Cloth Management Committee to postpone the registration of replication industry manufacturers; 3. Reduce and exempt business tax for the dyeing and weaving industry; 4. Open up the re-export of South China cotton cloth; 5. Organize a joint research committee on yarn and cloth distribution; 6. Request the cotton yarn market in this city to issue entry and exit permits to outer counties, and other important matters. Afterwards, all the teachers and students of Wenqi Vocational School held a joint reception and took a group photo, which was very enthusiastic. In the evening, the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association held a banquet at the International Hotel, after which everyone dispersed.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Authority States That Rice Prices Can Be Stable Long-Term</h3>
<p>The five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou are about to implement a full-scale rationing system for grain. The rice price surge of the past few days has leveled off, and people's minds are at ease. Rice prices in various places have fallen by more than 100,000 yuan compared to the morning peak. According to sources from the rice industry authority, rice prices are likely to fall sharply in the future, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>The current rice price has risen directly from over 600,000 yuan to 1.5 million yuan, a more violent increase than other commodities. Therefore, according to economic principles, the fall should also be very severe, possibly returning to within 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>The consumption of rice in Beijing and Shanghai accounts for the largest amount in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Now that huge amounts of foreign rice have arrived, rationing will begin in the two cities. The demand for rice in the rice-producing areas of Suxi Wujia will decrease, and prices are expected to continue to fall.</p>
<p>Over the past month, citizens have purchased and stored a lot of rice. Ordinary families have purchased and stored several months' worth of rice, so sales in rice shops have decreased sharply in recent days.</p>
<p>Continued tightening of credit, forcing hoarders to sell. Based on past experience, the rice market can be stable for a long period of time.</p>
<h3>Airplanes Prohibited From Transporting Cash; Ships and Trains Set Quotas</h3>
<p>[United Credit Reporting Agency News] The Ministry of Finance has formulated measures to restrict the transportation of cash to Shanghai and stimulate prices, which will be announced and implemented soon. The content of this method is:</p>
<p>Airplanes are absolutely prohibited from carrying cash.</p>
<p>Ships and trains can carry a fixed amount of cash.</p>
<p>If the quota is exceeded, the legitimate use must be stated, and an application for a permit must be submitted to the local financial management bureau for approval.</p>
<p>If the quota is exceeded and not approved, the excess portion will be forcibly deposited for limited-term withdrawal if found. The Ministry of Finance is deliberating on setting this quota based on the situation.</p>
<h3>China Fisheries Company Formally Established Today</h3>
<p>The China Fisheries Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which has been in preparation for two years, will be formally established today. The government had previously decided to allow the public to invest half of the shares. Therefore, the new company decided to use all its existing assets as official shares and to attract commercial shares of equal value to the official shares to form a board of directors and supervisors. The share offering is in progress. As of September last year, the estimated value of all assets was 117.5 billion yuan, including Huasheng Steel Plant, Huali Shipyard, Cod Liver Oil Factory, Anchovy Factory, four cold storage and ice-making plants, and twelve new-style fishing vessels.</p>
<h3>Last Year's National Tung Oil Export: Totaled Approximately 73,000 Tons: Earned Approximately $30 Million in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>According to accurate statistics from relevant sources, the total national tung oil export in 1947 was approximately 73,000 tons. Approximately 39,000 tons were shipped from Shanghai, accounting for 54% of the total. Approximately 33,600 tons were shipped from Hong Kong, accounting for 46% of the total. It is estimated that excluding over 10,000 tons smuggled through Hong Kong, the foreign exchange earned from tung oil exports last year was approximately $30 million. The China Vegetable Oil Factory accounted for the largest majority, followed by Yirui, Shenli, etc. The United States ranked first in terms of export countries, with approximately 48,000 tons, accounting for 66% of the total. The UK accounted for 7,800 tons, accounting for 11%. Continental European countries accounted for approximately 11,000 tons, accounting for 15%. India, Canada, South Africa, Japan, etc. accounted for approximately 2,500 tons, accounting for 3%. The China Trust Bureau's barter trade with the Soviet Union was 3,100 tons, accounting for 4%. Last year's tung oil export volume was not much different from before the war (the average annual export from 1935 to 1939 was 74,000 tons). Compared with the previous year's figures, it has increased by 84%. The reason for this is that the government has adopted various measures to promote exports and encourage foreign sales. Since the establishment of the Pingwei Fund Committee, foreign exchange has been adjusted at any time, and exporters have become more active. In addition, tung oil exporters and tung oil businesses in various places have supported the national policy and worked together. In addition, the CITIC Bureau was ordered to handle the purchase policy. Although its operating methods may not have fully conformed to the old habits of exporters at one time, and some believed it was competing with the people for profit, when my country's tung oil had no market abroad, the Bureau's purchase also provided considerable benefits to exporters. According to industry insiders' observations and evaluations of reports on crop production, this year's tung oil harvest is particularly good, and it is predicted that the total number of foreign sales in the future will not be reduced compared to last year. The only concern is that the production is slightly insufficient for supply. The reason is that after the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Cooperation, smuggling in South China has gradually decreased, and market prices can gradually stabilize. It is also estimated that the United States' monthly tung oil demand this year can increase to approximately 5,000 tons. Based on last year's total exports, it is only enough to supply the United States' needs. Including the UK's annual demand of 10,000 tons and other European countries, a situation of demand exceeding supply has formed. The increase in demand in the United States is mainly due to the steady supply of tung oil from my country after the war, gradually returning to the pre-war level, so it is no longer using substitutes. Regarding foreign market prices, the United States imported approximately 8,000 tons of tung oil from my country last month, coupled with the new oil being listed in that country, resulting in sluggish prices. The New York warehouse delivery price is 26 cents per pound. The UK is packaged in barrels, and each ton is 185 pounds. The domestic price in Shanghai is 3.2 million yuan per dan, and in Hankou it is 2.45 million yuan. (Unclear markings). It is also learned that the difficulty felt for the future of my country's tung oil is the transportation problem. In addition to delays during transportation, increased freight costs make it impossible to reduce costs. For example, the Yangtze River Shipping Industry Association originally stipulated that bulk tung oil freight be classified into the second category, but now it plans to be classified into the fourth category, which will increase the cost of tung oil exports.</p>
<h3>Winter Woolen Fabric Market Review: Costs Increase, Prices of Various Goods Repeatedly Set New Highs</h3>
<p>This winter, woolen fabrics rose sharply in October. Because the cost has increased step by step, the increase has also been significant. The reasons for the rise were the surge in black market gold and cash, the stimulation of the issuance of large banknotes, the inability to set prices for imported goods, and the low production and high costs of domestically produced goods. At the same time, the actual sales of the local merchants were smooth, and the public's desire to exchange currency for goods was rekindled, holding the view that buying early is cheaper. As a result, various goods sold well and repeatedly set new high prices.</p>
<p>The lining and veil types of suits, which are subject to the sharp rise in silk yarn raw materials, rose even more rapidly, and the long-haired velvet also rose rapidly. The McOden business became more difficult, regretting that the increase was too fierce, and many had no desire to operate. The fine wool tweed, mostly based on the Zhanghua goods soaring one million yuan as the standard, McOden rose to 680,000 yuan, bringing it up a lot.</p>
<p>Riding breeches, tweed and women's fabrics also became very prosperous. From the 20th, the market suddenly turned sharply down. The average overall decline was more than 10% compared to the peak. It was not until the 27th that the decline stopped and returned to level, but looking back at the market for the first half of the month, it was still somewhat higher.</p>
<p>The reason why woolen fabrics were able to suddenly shrink was due to the economic police's strict crackdown on the black market and hoarders, and the city government's efforts to suppress prices and the central bank's tightening of credit all contributed to it.</p>
<p>In early November, woolen fabrics presented a stable and stable situation. In the middle of the month, most of the lower reaches showed shrinkage and fatigue, while the lower sentence was all increased. The market was full of news of profitable buying, especially for public and private enterprises. The manufacturers themselves hoarded existing goods and continued to increase prices, and the Sino Textile allocation price also did the same.</p>
<p>In the last month of winter, prices of goods rose sharply, and by the time large banknotes were issued, postal rates increased, the US exchange rate repeatedly rose, military tickets and other public utilities were readjusted, rice prices were high, and daily necessities rose, even though the Sino Textile Bureau allocated wool yarn and woolen fabrics, it was still useless. If credit is not tightened, its upward trend will be even greater.</p>
<p>The rise of McOden and Haibailong was the most unique. In terms of sales, due to the tightening of the head lining, Fanliding, which is produced by this factory, had a lot of orders, and with the pressure of high interest loans, after Christmas, the winter woolen fabrics were expected to be better, but they were not sure to be released. Ankai sales successively fell into order. The local merchants' sales continued to degenerate. The sales of the Ben Det foreign firm were exposed by economic police for doing black market deals, and the transactions were disordered. In terms of orders, after the city, most foreign firms were more cautious. Except for Hong Kong, which tried to ship, the rest were changed from US currency to national currency.</p>

<h3>On Transuranic Elements: Also Discussing the Problem of Chinese Names</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Since Mendeleev's periodic table, arranged by atomic weight order, was published in 1870, the chemical community has unanimously recognized it as a milestone in chemical progress. It has simplified countless complex and difficult-to-solve problems. Because Mendeleev's periodic table is based on the periodicity of the chemical properties of elements and their relationship with their atomic valence, the properties of various elements can be predicted and determined accordingly. The research on elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 was able to be perfected thanks to the assistance of the periodic table, and the accurate determination of atomic weights also relied on the periodic table for correction.</p>
<p>Of course, the periodic table is not without its shortcomings. For example, hydrogen does not have a proper place in the periodic table; rare earth elements cannot be sequentially listed in the table; isotopes cannot be clearly indicated in the table; and elements with different chemical properties are also in the same group. In addition, there are several places where the order of elements does not follow the increasing order of atomic weight.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, Mendeleev's periodic table is great. With his enlightenment, chemists have gradually studied and improved it, and we have obtained a fairly complete periodic table, that is, the periodic table arranged according to the International Atomic Weight Table published in 1940. From hydrogen with atomic number 1 to uranium with atomic number 92, there are a total of ninety-two elements.</p>
<p>Before 1940, scientists could only prove the existence of these ninety-two elements in nature. However, the periodic table clearly shows us that the elements in the seventh period all have radioactive properties. Elements like radium and uranium are not very stable themselves, so it is an incomplete period. It is possible that under our diligent research, there will be new discoveries—radioactive elements that have emitted helium nuclei (alpha particles) and turned into other elements must also be able to accept the impact of neutrons or other particles and turn into new elements.</p>
<p>This ideal, in the wartime scientific community, has achieved great success under the efforts for the urgent needs of the war: elements 93 Neptunium, 94 Plutonium, 95 Americium, 96 Curium, which were once thought to be no longer possible, have been discovered. These are the so-called transuranic elements, or post-uranium elements.</p>
<p>The discovery of transuranic elements is a major progress in the chemical community. It is an epoch-making contribution in the atomic age. At the same time, according to authoritative predictions in the scientific community, transuranic elements may be like rare earth metals, forming a series of more than a dozen elements with similar properties, expanding the periodic table to over one hundred positions. But these remain to be studied.</p>
<p>We have seen these elements countless times in newspapers and magazines, but the Chinese translations vary, which can easily cause misunderstandings for readers and is quite inconvenient. Therefore, we feel that it is necessary to unify and define the Chinese translations.</p>
<p>In fact, there are three traditional rules in the chemical community for naming a new element: The first person to confirm the existence of each element (or its isotope) has the right to name this new element, without having to be approved by academic institutions; the discovery of a new element, whether it is a natural discovery or a man-made isotope, should be recognized without discrimination; if the discovery of a new element is incorrect and is denied, then the right to name it should be given to the later official discoverer.</p>
<p>As for the Chinese translation of elements, this was originally the responsibility of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, but before a formal decision is made, scholars and experts can propose translations for the convenience of application in literature, but they must still note the original name for reference. Therefore, there have been suggestions from various parties for the Chinese translations of new elements. For example, element 93, Neptunium, symbol Np, mass 239, has translations such as niobium, neptunium, and nickel; element 94, Plutonium, symbol Pu, mass also 239, has translations such as beryllium, etc. In fact, beryllium is in conflict with existing elements. Beryllium is the standard translation of BeryHium Be, is the standard translation of Praseodymium Pr in rare earth metals, which seems inappropriate. A more appropriate is , because the name Plutonium comes from Pluto, and translating the name as is more appropriate, however, the official translation still awaits confirmation by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau. As for other elements 95 Americium, elements 9698 Curium, due to the shorter time of discovery, there are no accurate reports on chemical properties, and there are no common translations.</p>
<p>In short, the translation requires accuracy and depends on the joint review of scientists, brainstorming, and will be helpful for future official approval.</p>
<p>This article is grateful to Dr. Tang Ningkang of Shanghai University for providing information. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Electronic Microscope</h3>
<p>— Ming Yu</p>
<p>Human vision has become sharper recently due to a new type of ultramicroscope. The mysteries of "ultramicroscopic bodies" that this ultramicroscope can see are something scientists could not have dreamed of before. It uses electrons instead of ordinary light rays and magnetic fields instead of refracting glass, revealing a world that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>Present-day microscopes are generally divided into three types: the most common type uses ordinary light to observe, placing us in another world where objects can be magnified up to 2,000 times; another type, with which we are less familiar, uses ultraviolet rays, which are extremely short and invisible to the human eye, and can only work on dry plates. Images taken with this type of microscope can be magnified up to 5,000 times compared to the original object. As for the new electronic microscope, it uses even shorter rays and can magnify objects up to 10,000 to 30,000 times, and the image is clear.</p>
<p>Two large electrical companies, Siemens in Germany and RCA in the United States, have been or are engaged in the manufacture of this new machine.</p>
<p>The first microscope made was as large as a corner of a room, but the latest streamlined electronic microscope can be carried in and out of ordinary houses and is reasonably priced at only $9,500. Buyers are mostly medical, physics, or chemistry laboratories, as well as universities and industrial organizations. It only requires connection to ordinary household current for use.</p>
<p>Scientists are often reluctant to publicly announce new discoveries, but snippets of the phenomena they see in this new world are occasionally leaked from the laboratory. Some bacteria that we are already familiar with can now be photographed more accurately, and those that have never been captured on camera can also be photographed. It is said that typhoid bacteria have wavy flagella, but no one knows their function; yeast is covered with a continuous and firm outer membrane, forming a chain; the internal structure of whooping cough bacteria is extremely peculiar. However, these discoveries, due to limited knowledge, have not yet been practically useful. Similarly, the electronic microscope will certainly be of great hope for conquering diseases in the future.</p>
<p>The industrial world is also paying close attention to this new invention. Scientists in factories are rushing to RCA with the specimens they want to study, and they are very excited when they set off. They are all amazed by the structure and appearance of the specimens they see, such as synthetic textile fibers. It is said that before the war, German scientists believed that this new tool could be of great use, and they had already manufactured similar microscopes. The German method of cement manufacturing was improved by this. Later, they also engaged in the study of mineral dust, which is of great importance to the health of mine workers.</p>
<p>The electronic microscope has made great contributions to expanding human vision and peering into a point in the universe, but it does not have a stunning appearance, and is not as visually impressive as the 200-inch Palomar telescope. It is shaped like a cylinder, placed on a table, about six and a half feet high, with some knobs and dials on top. The external appearance is only like this. Inside, there is a filament as thin as a hair, installed at the top of the cylinder. When current passes through this filament, a stream of electrons is emitted. Directly below the filament, there is a potential difference to accelerate the downward trend of the electron stream. Further down is a magnetic field that bends the current and converges it into a focus. The inside of the cylinder must be free of air to allow the electrons to flow unobstructed, so it is necessary to design an airlock so that the specimen can be inserted without affecting its high vacuum, which is also a clever point in the manufacture of this microscope. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Scientific Discussion</p>
<h3>1. My Views on the Sinicization of Digital Sectioning</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tingji</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Zhou Shangmin's "Sinicization of Digital Sectioning" in the 21st issue of this publication made me feel both empathy and joy, as I implemented the four-digit sectioning method as early as last year. According to the standard amount line, I deeply feel that four-digit sectioning is suitable for Chinese habits. Its advantages are that the sectioning is disciplined, the numbers are clear, the calculation is convenient, and brainpower is saved. If we blindly follow the Western-style three-digit sectioning, it is like discarding chopsticks and spoons to use knives and forks, which is only making things difficult for ourselves.</p>
<p>In the past, the amount sectioning was mostly modeled on the Western style, and there were no clear regulations in our country. However, the current amount numbers are huge, and payments are mostly astronomical figures, so the sectioning lines have increased sharply. Moreover, "wan wan wei yi" (ten thousand ten thousands is a hundred million) and "wan yi wei zhao" (ten thousand hundred millions is a trillion) have been officially stipulated since 1944. If we still adopt the Western-style imitation, it is even more inappropriate.</p>
<p>For example, if you write a three-digit sectioned number, 4,528,629,300, I am afraid that seven or eight out of ten people will be unable to recognize the number at a glance. If you use four-digit sectioning and write it as 45e2862v9300, using "e" to represent "yi" (hundred million) and "v" to represent "wan" (ten thousand), taking its simple planning and similar sound, it is easy to remember. In this way, at a glance, you can recognize the number as four billion five hundred and twenty-eight million six hundred and twenty-nine thousand three hundred yuan. Whose convenience is obvious. Since the Western amount sectioning does not care about how we recognize it, why should the Chinese digital sectioning care about the Westerners. Moreover, Westerners do not have "wan" (ten thousand), they call ten thousand "ten thousand," and one hundred thousand "one hundred thousand," which is very inconvenient. The reading of Chinese and Western numbers is so different, how can we abandon ourselves to follow others blindly?</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of transportation, driving to the left can also be changed to driving to the right. Then, in terms of accounting, can't we abolish the three-digit sectioning and use the four-digit sectioning instead? I hope that all sectors will gradually adopt the four-digit sectioning method, and even make it universally popular. Westerners can follow Western habits when interacting, but why shouldn't we use our own methods when counting ourselves, just like using both yin and yang layers at the same time. I hope that all the talented people and accounting experts in the country will participate in the discussion and give advice.</p>
<p>Deng Xinkang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhou Shimin's "Sinicization of Digital Sectioning" in the 21st issue of this publication and Mr. Kong Fanqing's discussion on this issue in the 23rd issue, I would also like to express some opinions.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the numbers are huge and difficult to read, so it is necessary to clarify them for the sake of clarity. Everyone says that there is no "wan" (ten thousand) digit in the West. In fact, the word "wan" above the thousands in English is Myriad. For example, 12340000 in English can be read as one thousand two hundred and thirty-four Myriad. The ninth to twelfth digits are Million. 3000,0000,0000 in English can be read as three thousand Million. The thirteenth to sixteenth digits are Billion, the seventeenth to twentieth digits are Trillon, the twenty-first to twenty-fourth digits are Ouadrillion, and the twenty-fifth to twenty-eighth digits are Ouintillion. The reading method can be inferred. I have always advocated using the four-digit sectioning method and persuaded Westerners to adopt it, but looking at the advantages and disadvantages, there is no distinction between ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. This is just a question of convenience in the application of numbers, not a matter of international standardization, and there is no need to "panic"! In fact, there are some things that we don't need to follow foreigners.</p>
<h3>Wire Recorder</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yong</p>
<p>Ordinary record players have to be interrupted after playing for a few minutes, even with automatic record changers. Moreover, wax records are fragile and bulky, so some people want to use another method to remedy these shortcomings.</p>
<p>As early as 1898, Danish scientist Paulsen pointed out the ideal of recording sound using "traces" made of magnetized metal; but he failed to overcome the difficulties he encountered and abandoned his experiment. It was not until 1942 that a 26-year-old American physicist, Camras, succeeded in his experiment based on the inspiration of his predecessor.</p>
<p>Camras's research was prompted by his cousin, because Camras's cousin was a singer who wanted to record his own voice for research. The progress of magnetism and electricity has been considerable in the past 50 years, and Camras has completed the work that his predecessors had not completed by relying on his knowledge in this field.</p>
<p>Camras passed a steel wire at a constant speed between the two poles adjacent to the electromagnet, and at the same time converted the sound waves into electrical impulses and passed them into the coil of the electromagnet. As a result, the electromagnet emits more or less magnetic force lines, and the steel wire also immediately feels continuous but changing magnetic properties, becoming many tiny permanent magnets, whose polar strengths vary but correspond to the original sound wave. If you want to reproduce the sound, first put the steel wire with the "traces" between the magnetic poles of the electromagnet and pass it through at the same speed as when recording. A pulsating current will occur in the coil. After amplification, connect it to a loudspeaker, and you can hear the same sound as at the beginning.</p>
<p>In the first few experiments, Camras found that when the steel wire passed through, if it twisted itself or turned an angle with the position during recording, the sound emitted would also become distorted and harsh instead of the original sound. Later, he moved the two magnetic poles very close, and also drew a small groove on the top to let the steel wire pass through and then move, and the defect of the sound being distorted was corrected. This improvement created a new type of recorder that can be used continuously for eight hours. It is only a roll of thin steel wire five inches in diameter and ten inches thick. Do you think old-fashioned record players and records can not be eliminated and become antiques?</p>
<p>Steel wire recorders are widely used in the military. For example, wireless radio outposts can use it to record tens of thousands of foreign broadcasts, and troops going to the front line can take it with them to record the sounds of the entire war. Civil aviation aircraft can use it as a flight log. If it is arranged with asbestos, it can also provide the best data for studying the cause of the accident in the event of an accident. Currently, GE and many manufacturers are manufacturing this type of recorder. Camras is also working with other scientists to promote its use.</p>
<p>The peacetime use of steel wire recorders is no less than that of portable wireless radios. It can record any sound, from a brilliant jazz music to a complete symphony or opera. Whether it is next to the radio, in the theater, in the nightclub, or in the concert hall, you can record speeches, meetings, trials, and even the entire agenda of the parliament on this slender steel wire.</p>

<h3>Wood Bleaching Method</h3>
<p>— Liu Suisheng</p>
<p>Bleaching agents such as bleaching powder are widely used for bleaching cloth and paper, which are well known; but they are not suitable for bleaching wood. Household woodenware and wood used for decorations are mostly not pure white, so the wood bleaching method is needed.</p>
<p>The formula for the chemicals used for bleaching wood is as follows:</p>
<p>Sodium silicate (commonly known as water glass) 16 parts</p>
<p>Sodium perborate 1.5 parts</p>
<p>Mix the above two chemicals and dissolve them in boiling water for use. When bleaching wood, simply dip a brush in this bleaching solution, apply it to the surface of the wood to be bleached, let it stand for half an hour, wipe off the solution, and wash it with water. After it dries naturally, polish it.</p>
<p>Note that this solution has a very strong bleaching power. If applied twice, the wood can be transformed from the color of bones to ivory white; even gray-black wood such as walnut wood can be effectively bleached with this solution.</p>
<p>Note: Water glass is a gray-white block or powder that can be dissolved in water. The molecular formula is Na2SiO3, which is made by dissolving sand (silicon dioxide) in a caustic soda solution.</p>
<p>Sodium perborate is a white crystalline substance with a salty taste that can be dissolved in water. The molecular formula is NaBO3.H2O or NaBO3.4H2O. The preparation method is to mix borax, sodium peroxide, and hydrogen peroxide solution and heat it to make it crystallize, or to pour boric acid and sodium peroxide into cold acidic water.</p>

<h3>Dreams</h3>
<p>— Huang Baorui</p>
<p>We all know that dreams are a very ordinary thing. Although a person does not dream every night, everyone should have had the experience of dreaming. At the same time, because dreams are ever-changing, there is always a mysterious feeling floating in people's minds about dreams, which also gives people a wrong idea.</p>
<p>Some people must ask, why do we dream?</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we must first understand that dreams are closely related to our wishes and experiences; because people's wishes are endless, and these wishes remain in different stages of individual development. Some of them can be satisfied in the entire individual development, and some cannot be satisfied. As for those wishes that cannot be satisfied, they are all suppressed in the subconscious. However, these suppressed wishes are not easily reduced and continue to be active in the subconscious. They often conflict with consciousness. If the power of the former exceeds the latter, not only will mistakes, jokes, illusions, and dreams occur, but sometimes the personality will tend to go bankrupt. When sleeping, the resistance of this conscious suppression is reduced, so the power of wishes in the subconscious increases and begins to be active. Therefore, those hidden experiences and wishes flow into the conscious world, and thus dreams are produced.</p>
<p>Some people ask me: "Why do we have nightmares when we hold our hands against our chests? Why do we dream of eating when we are hungry?" Although this question has research value, it gives people a wrong idea, because everyone actually thinks that this kind of stimulation is the origin of dreams. In fact, it is not. Chest pressure and hunger are just supplements to the number of dreams. Psychologists divide this kind of stimulation into two categories: external stimulation and internal stimulation.</p>
<p>External Stimulation</p>
<p>Tactile sensation—Dreams and the stimulation of tactile sensation are different; for example, dreaming that someone is pressing on the chest is due to one's own hand pressing down on the chest or a large amount of cotton quilt. This has been proved in Freud's interpretation of dreams. Someone dreamed of being sentenced to death by a judge at night, which was because his collar was too tight. Someone dreamed of sleeping with a girl at night, which was because his legs were holding his own hands...</p>
<p>Vision—If there is light stimulating the eyelids during sleep, it will also change the dream. I have a friend who dreamed at night that his new house was on fire and he couldn't put it out in time. The flames soared into the sky. When he woke up, he saw his old mother lighting a candle to find something; I once dreamed that my plane crashed on an iceberg. When I woke up, I found that the sunlight was shining on my face.</p>
<p>Hearing—If there is external sound stimulating hearing, it will also transfer the dream. For example, Gujin Tushu Jicheng·Dream Department says that if there is nothing, then you will dream of watching the drum beating. When you wake up, you only see your younger brother knocking on the door as the sound of the drum. Someone dreamed at night that a company was stolen, and alarm bells rang loudly, which was disturbed and frightened. It turned out to be the sound of the church bells.</p>
<p>Internal Stimulation</p>
<p>This situation is recorded in many ancient Chinese books. For example, Su Wen·Fu Yao Jingwei Pian says: "If Yin is abundant, you will dream of wading through a large body of water and be frightened. If Yang is abundant, you will dream of a big fire burning. If Yin and Yang are both abundant, you will dream of killing and injuring each other..." Another example is "If you are too full, you will give; if you are too hungry, you will take," etc., which everyone can understand. For example, people who are about to suffer from a fever will dream of monsters attacking; people who are about to suffer from hemiplegia will dream of being split in half, etc. These are all caused by internal stimulation, but remember, these are not the origin of dreams.</p>
<p>Secondly, we often see many people who worry about dreaming every night. They seek advice and fortune-telling everywhere, thinking that this is a symbol of poor health or neurasthenia. This concept is wrong. We must know that dreaming is not a physical phenomenon, but a psychological phenomenon, that is, dreams are the interpretation of personal past experience stimuli and the response to stimuli. Therefore, both fat and thin people, healthy and morbid people, will inevitably dream.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is that dreams have great contributions and benefits to us.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, people's wishes cannot be satisfied, and those wishes that cannot be satisfied are suppressed in the subconscious. Freud calls this consciousness that controls wishes the "self-heart supervision" (Endopsychicor). During the day, this resistance can mostly suppress subconscious wishes. When you fall asleep, this resistance is reduced, and the power of subconscious wishes increases, and they begin to be active in the conscious world. At this time, the sleeper has the wish to sleep, so these two wishes conflict with each other. At this time, if there is no dream phenomenon, a person's sleep will be affected, and the body and mind will be threatened (insomnia can be used as a reference). Therefore, dreams are produced to avoid these two conflicts. Dreams not only protect your sleep, but also indirectly satisfy our wishes. Now we should know what dreams are all about. Speaking of which, we should be able to correct people's view of the premonitions of dreams.</p>
<p>In order to give the reader a concept of dreams, the main points of the above-mentioned dreams are listed in a simple table as follows:</p>
<p>Origin—For the desire of wish,</p>
<p>Content—For the satisfaction of wish.</p>
<p>Form—For the experience of illusion,</p>
<p>Function—For the security of sleep.</p>

<h3>On Foresight</h3>
<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Siberian cold wave fiercely attacked Shanghai. The north wind blew particularly hard, making the zinc sheets on the roof of my humble house rattle. My servant Chongjing said to me, fortunately it didn't rain, otherwise my house would leak again. Speaking of roof leaks, it is a heartbreaking thing. Although this house is repaired every year, in addition to having a psychological guarantee, it is like no repairs at all. Every year during the rainy season, there is a big leak. Of course, "a broken house suffers from continuous rain" is common sense, so being sleepless all night is a common suffering. In resentment, after the weather clears, I immediately call a zinc sheet worker to repair it. It is strange to say that after the repair, the rainy season has passed, and the weather has been sunny for a long time. Since no rainwater falls from above, it is impossible to know whether the leak has been repaired or not. After half a year of wind and sun, the zinc sheet is no longer bound by the zinc nails and "rises up in time." As a result, in the next mildew season, isn't there still a big leak?</p>
<p>Therefore, after the north wind blew wildly this year, and the zinc sheet predicted a leak, I thought I had to follow the words of Zhu Zi's family motto, "It is appropriate to plan ahead before it rains," and ask a zinc sheet worker to repair and check it in advance. Scarlett, the heroine of Gone with the Wind, woke up in the vicissitudes of life, frequently encountering changes in the world, and returned to her quiet pastoral life in her hometown. Her only wish was to have a house that did not leak. A house that does not leak has become one of the wishes of life, which also shows how many leaky houses there are in the world.</p>
<p>In fact, a leaky house is a small matter. What is "affected" is only one room. If the Yellow River floods, it would be unimaginable. Homes are destroyed, residents drift, and what follows are famine, disease, cold, and even death. Therefore, the theories of those who have governed the Yellow River throughout history do not go beyond two ways: the best policy is to treat the root cause, focusing on dredging; the second best policy is to treat the symptoms, focusing on strengthening the dikes. Of course, dredging is better than strengthening the dikes, which is an active measure of foresight. As for strengthening the dikes, the flood always breaks the defense line, rushing in. In the years of Yellow River disaster, dikes must be repaired, which is the same as repairing the zinc sheets in my humble house every year.</p>
<p>Therefore, I advocate preventing problems before they occur, and we must use the method of dredging. Remove pollution and congestion, buffer the rapids, channel the streams, and bring them into the sea. This is the best method in the "On Foresight". All man-made disputes should be dredged in advance, so that the dikes will be strong on their own, and many shocking and unfortunate events in newspapers can be reduced invisibly.</p>
<h3>Nameless Heroes</h3>
<p>— Hilly</p>
<p>During the occupation of France, besides a few well-known resistance heroes, there were also many nameless heroes—men, women, and even children, all of whom willingly suffered or risked their lives to help their Allied forces. The following story fully demonstrates their courage and spirit.</p>
<p>One morning in 1944, a British fighter plane was unfortunately shot down over Normandy. The pilot safely descended to the ground by parachute. He threw away the helmet he was wearing, put on a raincoat to completely cover his inner military uniform, and began speaking French to people. This simple disguise allowed him to impersonate a local resident. Suddenly, he remembered a place where he could temporarily hide in case of misfortune. So, he entered a town and boarded a train. The carriage was already full of French people, and he sat down among them. After the ticket inspector checked his ticket, he thought he was out of danger. However, before long, a policeman entered to check the identity cards of each passenger. The only document the pilot had could only prove that he was a member of the Royal Air Force.</p>
<p>The policeman looked at the unusual document again and again. After a long while, he finally asked, "What is this?"</p>
<p>"My identity card."</p>
<p>"Are you a pilot?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Are you serving in the Royal Air Force?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I was shot down here... I want to escape."</p>
<p>The surprised policeman exclaimed, "But, sir, you must know that such a document is not valid! You will be in trouble."</p>
<p>The pilot shrugged helplessly. The passengers in the carriage had just buried my deceased brother-in-law. His build is similar to yours. I will give you the clothes he left behind, which will give you much convenience."</p>
<p>Another old man with a white beard said, "You are an officer, and I am a retired officer. Of course, I will protect you. You should come to my house."</p>
<p>The carriage was filled with noise, with everyone vying to say, "I will help you do this. I will do that for you..." In short, everyone wanted to drown out the voices of others and offer their own advice to help the pilot. Even the policeman did not want to be left behind and offered his advice.</p>
<p>Although there might have been one or two German informants or spies in the carriage, who could have been executed for aiding the enemy, none of them were willing.</p>
<p>When the train arrived at its destination, the passengers crowded around the pilot and got out of the carriage. The policeman went down first and said to a French military policeman who was checking passengers at the station, "That man without a hat is my friend. Please let him pass." The pilot was escorted by the other passengers and safely left the train station.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, he had safely returned to London.</p>
<p>Mao Yi, British Broadcaster. The "Daily Express" (Daily Express), run by British newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, has a daily circulation of nearly four million copies, making it one of Britain's leading newspapers. The "Daily Express" is located on Fleet Street in London, where it is busy day and night. One floor is the printing room, where the noise of the machines is incessant all night. Before the war, the newspaper published twenty-four pages a day, and four hundred tons of white paper were printed with black text every night. During and after the war, due to paper conservation, the number of pages has been reduced to six. However, due to increased circulation, the "Daily Express" still needs 130 tons of paper every day.</p>
<p>The second floor is the editorial department, which has twelve telegraph receivers that are constantly ticking all day long. From 8:30 in the morning, clerks come to transcribe the telegrams. They divide the telegrams into three categories: international news, domestic news, and sports news, and then hand them over to the respective managing editors. The editorial offices of each department are also not small. The international news editorial office alone has ten desks, and one person is specially responsible for classifying telegrams according to country.</p>
<p>The editorial department holds two meetings a day, chaired by the editor-in-chief. The first meeting is held at noon, and the second is held at 5:30 in the afternoon. The discussions mainly involve reviewing the past and handling the allocation and attitude of news work.</p>
<p>After the second meeting is over, the assistant editors begin to work. They work a full eight hours a day—from 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. the next morning. However, unlike our country's editors who work seven days a week, they have two days off each week on a rotating basis.</p>
<p>The "Daily Express" has branches in the two major cities of Manchester and Glasgow. There are dedicated telegraph lines between the two branches and the main office, and telegrams are exchanged without delay, with daily transmissions and receipts reaching 30,000 to 40,000 words.</p>
<p>The "Daily Express" also has a very busy telephone service. Seventeen operators start working at 5:00 in the morning. There are about 3,000 incoming and outgoing calls on weekdays, and even on holidays there are 1,000 incoming and outgoing calls.</p>
<p>There are three tea supply points in the London headquarters, which are open all day in shifts to provide tea for the more than 3,200 employees in the building. The daily consumption of tea reaches 19 and a half pounds.</p>
<h3>Naive Arguments</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Today, grand pronouncements and high-sounding arguments are abundant, but they are mostly self-serving or outdated clichés, and extremely unreasonable. I think that children's words are sometimes quite delightful. This is especially true for parents. Walter Winchell once said, "In your mother's eyes, you can do no wrong, because she is always observing you with her heart." I hereby record a few interesting sayings below—</p>
<p>A three-year-old girl saw wrinkles on her palms while taking a bath. She said, "Mommy, look how sad my hands are!"</p>
<p>When a teacher was observing his young students, he discovered that a student named Xier had the dirtiest hands. He said to the students, "If you can point out another hand that is dirtier than Xier's, I will not punish him."</p>
<p>No one in the classroom made a sound. Finally, Xier himself said softly, "Teacher, please look at my other hand."</p>
<p>My four-year-old niece was originally playing in the snow with two friends, but suddenly left them and ran towards me, looking like she was about to cry.</p>
<p>I asked her, "Binbin, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>She sobbed and said, "My boyfriend, Tang Ge, doesn't like me anymore."</p>
<p>I comforted her, "Why do you say that? Tang Ge certainly likes you. I was watching you when you were playing, and you seemed to be having a lot of fun."</p>
<p>"No, I can see it! He throws snow at the new girl more than he throws it at me!"</p>
<p>A boy had just learned some astronomical knowledge and wanted to impart his astronomy to his younger sister in the evening.</p>
<p>He solemnly asked his younger sister, "Do you see that little speck of a star in the sky? That little star is much bigger than the Earth."</p>
<p>His younger sister did not believe him and retorted, "Then why can't it block the rain?"</p>
<p>A child drew a horse for his mother to see. The mother said, "But why does this horse have five legs?"</p>
<p>The child explained, "I gave it five legs in case one of them breaks."</p>
<h3>God and Calluses</h3>
<p>— Tong</p>
<p>A sixteen-year-old girl was lying down, about to die. She was the eldest sister in a large, impoverished family without a mother. She had borne the burden of the family throughout her childhood. Due to overwork, she contracted tuberculosis and was about to die. A visitor asked her if she had been baptized or attended church. She replied, "No."</p>
<p>The visitor said, "Then what will you tell God when your soul goes to heaven?"</p>
<p>The child stretched out a pair of thin and almost transparent hands, covered in calluses from constant work, and said, "I will give a pair of hands to God to see!"</p>
<h3>Dentist Bird</h3>
<p>— Tuo</p>
<p>If African crocodiles develop dental problems, it is very convenient to find a dentist. In fact, all they have to do is open their mouths. A dentist bird that lives on the banks of the Nile River will immediately fly over to treat them when it sees this "pain signal." The bird, which is about the size of a sparrow, sees the crocodile's mouth permanently open as if yawning, and then dives into the crocodile's mouth full of cavities to work. The dentist bird's medical work includes pecking away leeches and other parasites that adhere to the crevices of the teeth, under the tongue, and in the recesses of the oral cavity.</p>
<p>Is there a medical fee? No matter how savage crocodiles are, they have a gentleman's agreement that they cannot swallow the little bird in one gulp during the treatment process.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Effort Failed (46)</p>
<p>After Zhu Qi and Yun Qing finished lunch, they went to the bank together. Yun Qing went straight to Feng Sheng's house and saw her wearing a cotton robe, covered in grease, with a white cloth apron around her waist. She had just come out of the kitchen and said with a smile, "Sister-in-law, you are so busy!" Feng Sheng said, "What can I do? Zhu Qi can't eat the dishes cooked by the old woman. If I don't do it, he won't eat a meal all day." Upon hearing this, Yun Qing felt a pang of guilt in her heart. She knew how loyal Feng Sheng was to Zhu Qi. I came here to stir up trouble and ruin her good marriage. I feel ashamed! Feng Sheng invited Yun Qing into the house, poured tea, and offered her a seat, chattering about household expenses, how much rice cost, how much coal cost, and so on. Yun Qing was in no mood to listen to her. She secretly pondered whether to say what she had planned to say. It would hurt her heart if she did, but she would miss the opportunity if she didn't. She was usually very confident, but today she felt confused. Feng Sheng said many things, but Yun Qing didn't hear a word of it. Later, Feng Sheng asked her how much it would cost to make a gold pin. Yun Qing vaguely didn't know what she was asking and just nodded and said, "Yes, yes." Feng Sheng saw that Yun Qing was absent-minded, just staring blankly at her, and didn't seem to be as lively and talkative as usual. She asked, "Elder sister, what's wrong with you today? Are you sick?" Yun Qing was startled by her question. She frowned, wanting to speak but hesitating. Feng Sheng said, "You are a very loyal person, but men are very fickle. Don't be angry at what I'm about to say." Feng Sheng said, "Elder sister, you must have heard Zhu Qi saying something about me outside. Please tell me. I won't be angry." Yun Qing thought to herself, if I slowly tell her, her mind is not clear, she will not be able to understand the situation, it is better to tell her directly and happily that Zhu Qi wants to divorce her, and see how she reacts. Having made up her mind, she frowned and said, "I shouldn't tell you this, but I am so angry that I have to tell you. Zhu Qi has decided to divorce you!" Feng Sheng heard these words as if she had been struck by lightning. Her two big eyes widened, and she was stunned, unable to say a word. After a long while, she wailed and burst into tears on the table. Yun Qing felt sorry and repeatedly persuaded her, telling her not to cry. Feng Sheng cried and shouted, "What should I do! What should I do! He doesn't want me anymore. I knew there would be such a day! I'm finished, I'm finished!" Yun Qing said, "Don't cry. Things are not that simple. I came here today to stand up for you and discuss this matter with you. I sympathize with you. Even if Zhu Qi doesn't want you, you can't just agree to him casually."</p>
<h3>The Reason Why Muslims Don't Eat Pork</h3>
<p>— Wu Tegong</p>
<p>Islam was introduced to China during the Tang Dynasty, more than 1,300 years ago. The reason why Muslims do not eat pork is just a small part of Islamic customs and is not very mysterious, yet it has received much attention from non-Muslims. For example, Cantonese people consider snake and cat to be delicious "Dragon Tiger Soup," and also like to eat mice. People from other provinces do not consider it strange that people from other provinces do not eat these three things, and they do not make any wild guesses.</p>
<p>However, many people often consider it a strange thing that Muslims do not eat pork and make all kinds of unpleasant remarks. In fact, the reason why Muslims absolutely adhere to this prohibition is simply because they devoutly follow the admonitions in the ancient Islamic scripture, the Quran. The following is a translation of the text in the Quran regarding the dietary prohibitions for Muslims to clarify the matter.</p>
<p>The Quran says, "Say to the believers: Eat of the good things We have provided you and be thankful to Allah (the Arabic name for the Lord), if it is Him you worship. He has only forbidden you dead animals (Note: fish is not included), blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful." (Chapter 2, verses 172 and 173)</p>
<p>Before the revelation of the above two verses, Allah had revealed to Muhammad a similar admonition: "Say, 'I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or a sinful [offering] dedicated to other than Allah...'" (Chapter 6, verse 146)</p>
<p>Allah finally revealed: "Forbidden to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and [animals] strangled or beaten to death or killed by a fall or gored to death or killed by a wild animal - except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death] - and what is sacrificed on stone altars, and [prohibited is] that you seek decision through divining arrows. That is grave disobedience." (Chapter 5, verse 3)</p>
<p>The Quran's dietary prohibitions for Muslims are exhausted in the above text. From this, it can be seen that Muslims not only do not eat pork, but also do not eat cattle and sheep that have not been slaughtered in the name of Allah, animals that have died naturally or have been injured and not formally slaughtered, or morally corrupt meat. As for the reason why they do not eat pork, the scripture specifically indicates that this substance is impure and is listed below dead animals and blood, indicating that it is similar to these two substances. Therefore, Muslims not eating meat is just a small part of Islamic customs. Apart from following scripture and paying attention to hygiene, there is no other reason. They can even eat a little when they are starving. As for why they never taste it on a normal day, it is true. Not eating pork is not a unique prohibition of Islam. According to ancient history, the priests and nobles of Egypt did not eat this substance long ago, also because it was impure. Judaism also does not eat pork. Deuteronomy 14:8 says, "And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase." Leviticus 11:7-8 also has the same text. The texts in the four Gospels of the New Testament that mention animals also prove that Jesus considered pigs to be unclean animals. Although non-Muslims in China like to eat pork, the various medical opinions recorded in the Materia Medica under the category of pigs all recognize that pork is harmful. (The article is too long to quote). Modern science has discovered that pork contains more than a dozen different types of putrefactive bacteria, the most harmful of which is the trichinella worm, which is as thin as a hair and can cause several types of diseases. Therefore, the fact that Muslims absolutely do not eat pork is a true indication that they absolutely pay attention to hygiene and there is nothing mysterious about it.</p>
<p>The author has been involved in the press for a long time and is also a Muslim, so I uphold justice and write this humble article to contribute to the public. At this time of great turmoil, non-Muslims and Muslims should especially help each other in the same boat and care for each other. Therefore, not only should we abandon all false statements about Muslims not eating pork, but also about Islam, such as "holding the scriptures in the left hand and holding the sword in the right hand." This is the author's sincere wish.</p>
<h3>On Scholarships</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>The Municipal Scholarship Unification Committee has decided to increase the total amount of scholarships for the next semester to 15 billion yuan. Scholarships for students at public universities will be 1.5 million to 3 million yuan, and scholarships for students at private universities will be 3 million to 4.5 million yuan. In today's high-inflation environment, although this amount is not very large, it still has an exciting effect on ordinary poor students. At the same time, in terms of the significance of social figures giving encouragement to poor students, it has infinite value.</p>
<p>Since scholarships give hope to poor students and have social significance, the school authorities and the Unification Committee should conduct accurate reviews and careful assessments when reviewing the quota and amount of the scholarship. The specific review standards and methods have already been stipulated by various schools and the Unification Committee, but whether the distribution of funds is rationalized may not be entirely as ideal as we would like.</p>
<p>For example, in the past, various schools used grades as the review standard. It is said that only those with grades above 75 points could receive a small scholarship, and only those with grades above 80 points could receive a larger scholarship. In this way, poor students are at a relatively disadvantageous position. Because poor students often earn money in various ways, such as submitting articles or working part-time, to pay for their meals, they have to transfer some precious time away from their studies. In this case, their grades are slightly worse than those of students who are well-fed and have no worries. This is a very forgivable fact. When reviewing scholarships, if a truly poor student does not receive a scholarship or only receives a small scholarship for just one or two points difference, while many students who can be well-fed or even quite wealthy receive the benefits, how unfair and unreasonable is this phenomenon?</p>
<p>If the establishment of scholarships is only for scholarship's sake, then it is perfectly acceptable to use grades as the review standard. However, if, in addition to scholarships, it also has the meaning of cultivating poor students not to drop out of school due to economic difficulties, then students with the same grades but vastly different economic situations cannot be treated the same. When reviewing scholarships, various schools should reasonably coordinate the "degree" of poverty of each applicant in addition to grades as a matter of course. Rather than subsidizing well-fed students with valuable scholarships for new clothes or entertainment, it would be better to help students who are just a few points behind and are frowning and worrying about not being able to pay for their meals. Only in this way can scholarships maintain their original meaning.</p>
<h3>Social Services - Income and Expenditure Report on Student Aid for the Current Semester</h3>
<h3>Chengyi High School Students Enthusiastically Help Refugees - Rice Coupon Books Sent to Winter Relief Association for Distribution</h3>
<p>Rice coupons were transferred to the Winter Relief Association for distribution. The Student Union of Shanghai Private Chengyi High School recently sent a letter to this newspaper stating: "In response to the winter clothing donation campaign, this association launched a winter clothing donation campaign among students at all levels at the end of December last year, raising more than 700 pieces of winter clothing of various sizes, worth more than 9 million yuan. In addition to winter clothing, after investigation, and in conjunction with the Advanced Mechanical Vocational School and the Huisheng Midwifery School, refugees were distributed in the Nanshi Ninghe Road and Sanpailou areas. The remaining winter clothing funds have been negotiated with Tianyi Rice Store on Xingguo Road (at the intersection of Tai'an Road) in this city to release Xian rice on a selected date. We have long admired your organization's outstanding achievements in serving the community, and we especially request your assistance in distributing rice coupons to jointly promote justice. Enclosed are 308 rice coupons, please check and handle," etc. In addition to having agreed with the association to send the rice coupons to the Shanghai Winter Relief Committee for redistribution to refugees to show prudence and avoid disputes, we also express our sincere gratitude to Chengyi High School, Advanced Mechanical Vocational School, Zhuan Sheng Student Association School students at all levels, and people from all walks of life who have generously donated on behalf of the beneficiary refugees.</p>
