<h3>裕仁的戰責與天皇制</h3>
<p>東京戰犯審訊法庭業已閉幕，對於日皇裕仁是否負戰爭責任一項問題，並未作何决定。據中央社東京七日專電稱：美國檢察官，因爲大多數日人若見其日皇受審，則將深感不安，而以此爲國恥，故極力避免法庭討論日皇應否負戰爭責任問題·同時，東條英機受審時，也極力替日皇辯護，企圖解除日皇的青任問題；他在供辭中說：「對英美宣戰是我幹的，與日皇裕仁無關，與任何官民無涉，一切責任均由我東條一人負責好了。」準此而論，日皇所應負的戰責，恐將因此而陰悄了吧。</p>
<p>但就常識來判斷，凡是略知日本政情的人，無不認為「天皇制」是日本一切侵略勢力的掩護物，欲求日本政治的眞正民主化，必須加以廢除·上次國民大會通過請政府確定對日和約原則提案，也說「天皇制」是日本軍國主義的核心，應予廢除。其實盟國在波茨坦會議時，也無不主張廢除「天皇制」的。波茨坦宣言規定：「欺騙和錯誤領　日本人民，使其從事於征服世界的權威和勢力，必須予以永久排除」，這不是明明白白指日本天皇制與日皇裕仁而言的嗎？但在盟國要求日本無條件接受波茨坦宣言時，却發生了變化，日本在覆女中提出一個修正條款：「上述宣言，並不包括任何要求有損失日皇為一具有主權之統治者的特別權威」，盟國為順應日本的要求，乃予以答覆稱：「日皇的命運繫於日本人身上·」於是「天皇制」的存廢問題，從此暫時保留了下來。</p>
<p>美國朝野對於這個問題，則始終另有見解·美國前任駐日大使格魯，於一九四四年十二月廿二日就向參院外交委員會建議，主張維持「天皇制」。他說：「日本的「天皇制」，實為維持「安定勢力」的唯一的政治因素。」此在東京盟軍總部，也根據同樣的理由，並認為日皇將為盟方可以控制日人之唯一媒介，不僅深恐審訊日皇裕仁引起日人强力的反應，而且不惜替他的戰責作種種掩護和辯解·盟軍總部顧問彭士竟謂：「我們要面對現實，日本人民還是崇拜天皇。」後來盟總指導日人起草民主憲法，雖然把天皇在政治上的一切權利，一加以剝削，國家的主權屬於全體人民，但「天皇制」依舊保留，僅將天皇改為「國家的象徵」而已。</p>
<p>我們平心而論，日人果能眞心誠意，要採取英國式的君主立憲制把日皇變為英國式的皇帝，僅視為「國家的象徵」，不能何作為，則此事當為將來日本制憲上的問題。記得一九四三年十二月一日開羅會議時，我國領袖蔣總統，對於日皇問題，也曾發表過一個聲明：「倘使日本人民起來發動革命，懲罰他們的好戰份子，並推翻為軍閥所操縱的政府，則參加開羅會議的各國，均將尊重他們日人自己的願望，允許他們自己自由選擇政府的形式」。這一篇談話，當時曾獲得羅斯福總統的完全同意。現在中美兩國對於此一問題，當然也惟有遵守此項諾言而行事。</p>
<p>所以天皇制的存廢問題，自可由日本全國人民憑共自由意志去決定。但我們不能不指出，日皇裕仁所應負的戰責，不應與此問題混為一談。東京戰犯審訊法庭避不討論日皇戰責問題，無疑的是一大錯誤。日皇裕仁是「天字第一號的戰犯」，不論對中國的侵略戰，或對美國的戰爭，都要其負整個責任，旣不容其推諉，也不許其黠辯。戰時美國各報，均曾指裕仁為「第一號戰犯」，就是一個絕好的鐵瞪。最近東京讀賣新聞測騐民意，頗多日人主張裕仁遜位，他們的用意固在要藉此保留天皇制，勿受戰責問題之累，日本人民自己也承認裕仁應負戰責，可於此得一有力的證明。因為卽使日本保留天皇制，也不一定要保留應負戰爭責任的裕仁的皇位。</p>
<p>要之，東京戰犯審訊法庭的避不討論日皇裕仁的戰責問題，實為過於遷就現實的一大失職，而且把嚴懲戰犯的意義也喪失得一乾二淨的了。我們於此，應該站在正義的立塲，喚起美國政府及東京盟總的注意。</p>
<h3>接受日投降三週年紀念　何應欽沉痛廣播　目前的剿匪是抗戰的延續</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕國防部長何應欽為紀念卅四年九月九日在京代表最高統帥接受中國戰區日軍無條件投降，於今日下午五時半舉行茶會，招待當年陸軍總司令部高級幕僚及參加受降典禮之新聞記者，并於晚八時應中央及軍中兩廣播電台之邀，對全國同胞發表演說。何氏於演飼中，首申述此受降起念日之歷史意義，并追述其當時愉快之心情，以為中國經八年艱苦之抗戰從此可以復興，世界和平自此得以永奠。誰知三年來外寇雖已消除，匪患却繼之而起。氏以沉痛語氣稱：「因為共匪的全面叛亂，致使國家建設受到阻擾，復興大業不能展開，我們今天來紀念這一富有歷史意義的日子，實在不能不感到無限傷心，無限沉痛！」氏並謂：八年艱苦抗戰之目的，為求國家民族抗戰日由平等，而目前戡亂剿匪也同樣為了國家民族的自由平等。渠稱：「為了確保國家領土之完整，政令之統一，所以目前的剿匪，本質上正是八年抗戰的延續。」</p>
<p>喚起同胞全力戡亂</p>
<p>何氏並申述政府因國家經過八年抗戰，物資貧困民生疾苦已達極，點故最初對共匪曾一再優容，望其改悔，然共匪背紫祖群，估惡不　，反而擴大叛亂，政府於萬不得已，才明令戡亂。於此，氏喚起同胞，拿出所有人力物力來支持戡亂。渠稱：本人深深知道，自從抗戰剿匪迄今十一年間，全國同胞對於人力物力的担負，已經盡了至大的努力，但是目前剿匪工作尚未完成，我們要縮短戡亂期間，早日開始建國，還須更進一步加緊努力；我們知道，共匪是不受法令限制，不顱人民痛苦的，他們可以利用一切高壓和殘酷的手段，集中控制區所有的人力物力，從事叛亂，所以目前剿匪軍事的規模異常龐大作戰的消耗較之抗戰期間更有過之無不及，前方官兵忍受一切物質上的困難，浴血奮戰，以過止赤禍；我們在後方的同胞，應該不容坐視，應該以一切為前方拿出所有的人力物力來支持戡亂。現代的戰爭是總體戰，決不是單純的武力戰，尤其剿匪作戰，必須全國同胞各就其本身崗位一致協力，那麼匪患扌能早日平定，社會秩序才得以恢復。我們在受降紀念的今天，正可以回想我們是如何舉國一致，戰勝了强敵，同時我們尤其要互相勉勵，今後更應如何一致協力，確保我們勝利的果實。我相信全國同胞，一定會在戡亂第一的總目標之下，一德一心擁護戡亂的國策，各盡所能輸財輸力，以抗戰必勝的信念和決心，來保證剿匪必勝，建國必成。我敢說，强暴的日本軍閥尚且不能達到滅亡我國的企圖，那慶任何叛徒也決不能妄想傾覆我們的政府，滅亡我們的國家。</p>
<h3>緬懷前途　感慨萬千</h3>
<p>渠末謂：「受降以來，三週年巳經過去，就國內局勢來說，共匪騷擾，一切建設還沒有得到顯著的進步；就世界局勢來說，兩大陣綫之間冾戰未休，聯合國機構尚不能澈底解決國際間的種種問題。緬懷受降當時我國以至全世界的光明前途，我們不禁感慨萬千，但是國家民族的自由平等，我舞是要不惜一切犧牲，全力爭取的。世界局勢的安定，我們是要不顧一切困難努力促成的。本人誠懇希望我全國同胞一致協力，共同奮勉，各就本身的崗位，盡忠國家，於戡亂中謀建設，在動　中求安定，迅速戡平匪患，復興國家，進而與世界各民主國家共同推進世界的永久和平。」</p>

<h3>柏林市議會騷擾事件　蘇拒絕美法抗議　蘇機羣大空中走廊演習</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林九日電〕蘇方當局九日拒絕西方國家識責蘇方包團柏林市府，將市議會趕入西區，衝破軍事聯絡辦公室，並逮捕西區德警四十名而造成兩天來的恐怖的一切抗議。當蘇方拒絕考慮西方國家軍事長官的抗議宣佈之時，蘇聯戰〔機正在柏林上空演習，並在西方國家的空中走廊中作交又飛行。柏林蘇軍司令柯蒂哥夫少將拒絕美方的抗議，認為全無根據。美方的照會係田柏林美軍司令霍萊上校親自交與柯蒂哥夫者。霍萊在照會中抗議蘇軍及東區德警在六日晚衝進柏林市府內的美軍聯絡辦公室，捕去西區德警二十人，共產黨人並歐辱在塲的英美新聞記者。法方的照會係由駐德法軍總司令柯尼格交與蘇軍副總司令克拉特文少將者。照會內抗議群軍違背業柯洛夫斯基元的安全通過的諾言，逮捕自柏林市府撤往法區的西區德警十九人，但亦遭克拉特文的峻拒。渠冷然答覆法方要求釋放被捕德警的請求稱，此事完全是一德國事件與蘇方無關。蘇方對上述兩項照會的拒絕，均由向蘇聯官方登記的德意志通訊社宣布。此一柏林「冷戰」的新事件，正與四强軍事長官柏林會談的擱淺同時發生，柏林會談己因不能通過幣制問題而無限期延會。某一消息靈通的人土稱：蘇聯要求柏林全市接受蘇方的東德馬克，一切財政事務則由一諮詢委員會管理。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林九日電〕蘇聯於通知四强空航安全中心將在以七日中以更多飛機在西方空中走廊中實行演習，使走廊達於飽和狀態後，九日中午群方戰鬥機羣卽怒吼飛越柏林美佔區。蘇聯以演習為各，威脅柏林之空輸，一般認為係蘇聯奪取全市計劃之一部份。中午飛越柏林之蘇機至少有十架，美當局估計高度在一萬呎以上。又稱：如蘇聯維持此一高度，該項演習悉遵四强規定，無可非議。空輸起點威斯巴登之美官員稱，蘇方欲以演習打撃美方空輸，失敗可以預卜。「蓋空中走廊頗為遼闊，故意外事件甚難發生，除非群方蓄意衝撞，然本身亦有墜地之虞」</p>
<h3>杜魯門支持馬卿政策　決維護在柏林權益　表示不顧在壓力下談判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓九日廣播：杜魯門總統九日在記者招待會中對馬歇爾宣佈强硬政策，以反抗柏林共黨之行為一節，加以誼實。記者紛紛提出詢問，但杜魯門拒不作答。渠謂在繼續努力解決美蘇糾紛之際，美國當維護其在柏林之權益。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華感頓九日電〕國務卿馬歇爾昨在記者招待會中稱，柏林市政廳事件，應由「德國與外國」之共黨份子負責，其目的顯然欲推翻民主之機構，我人必須予以堅決之抵抗。然馬歇爾拒絕答覆美國是否將採取電事性之反措置。渠稱，四國軍事長官目前正在研究交通與幣制委員會之報告，希望長官會議能續開，而市政應事件亦不致影嚮草斯科之會談。馬歇爾軍申一點，美國之政策，即決不在壓力之下進行談判</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕此間外交官員相信，在蘇方策動下，柏林之暴動使緊張之局勢益趨危急，任何意外均可因之發生。此間認為柏林動亂表示克林姆宮不顧莫斯科及柏林兩地關係柏林封銷之會談，仍決意逐西方國家出柏林。此間外交專家效不自承明瞭蘇方突在該地倒行逆施之動機，特別是在四强軍事總督會談已到具體之際。然彼等列舉下列可能性：（一）蘇聯全能之政治局可能認為解除對鎖及實施單一貨幣之談判，對蘇大為不利。（二）蘇聯可能利用法國之政潮拖延時間，以爭取有利條件。過去與蘇辦理外交有經驗之人士更指出第三種可能性，即暴動僅係蘇聯突然打開封鎖之烟幕，然此僅係一種可能性，尚無人對此抱有希望。此間外交家所一致公認者厥為柏林料紛業已危機四伏。</p>
<h3>柏林市民十萬　反共大示威</h3>

<p>英美與蘇意見歧異</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕權威方面悉：義大利前殖民地問題當由九月廿一日在巴黎召開之聯大會予以決定，英美之意見大體一致，即（一）暫時維持里比亞之現狀，以保持地中海之均勢，而防止共產主義之潛入。（二）將伊利特里亞歸還義大利，然替阿比西尼亞劃出一通往海口之走廊。（三）將素瑪里籣歸還義大利。（四）的黎波里與西那伊加暫時仍置於英軍統治之下，蓋英美兩國均認為必須在該處保留海空軍基地。按蘇聯乃主張將所有前義殖民地歸還義大利，英美不同意理由之一，為義大利之財政情形無力開發是等全部土地。故此間觀察家認為由於上述之歧異，四國外長不能解決義殖民地問題，而此一問題必須在本屆或下屆聯大會中取得解決。</p>

<h3>參會七次大會揭議長致詞感慨萬端　接開首次會議聽取市長報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第七次大會，於昨晨在塘沽路該會大禮堂隆重揭幕。潘議長領導行禮如儀後，卽席致開幕詞，繼由吳市長致詞，最後由趙仰雄致答詞，典禮於十一時完成。休息十分鐘，接開第一次會議，由吳市長先作施政報告，並答覆參議員各項質詢後，於中午散會。</p>
<p>潘議長致詞略云：本會在今天舉行第七次大會，吾人試一回憶兩年來的經過，檢討二十天中的情况，一定都有或多或少的感想。公展謹約略一述個人之所感，願與本會同仁交相共勉必須努力做到眞能代表公意市參議員任期已滿，原應改選，惟以憲法頒布，地方自治法規有待重訂，同仁任期奉令延長至將來依照憲法產生之市議會成立之日為止，故今天舉行第七次大會。惟其如此，吾人希望現正開會之立法院能儘速完成關於地方自治之通則，尤其關於直轄市之自治通則，使本市能依據此項通則，言先完成我國家行憲後直轄市之自治體制。第二，民意機關如何始能直正代表民意，實在值得吾人深思·吾人受市民暹舉之付託，一方面須　到最低限度之市政建設，而另一方又須顧到最高限度之市民負擔，在此夾道之中，勉求其能盡使命，自非易事。公展以為同仁宜虛心容物，博訪周諮，歡迎任何市民負責報告與建議，以為討論問題之參考，馴至於必要時，可與與論報紙商治，試辦苦干問題之民意測驗，使本會討論議案時所取決者，恰與眞正大多數之民意相符。</p>
<p>重視上海之外兼顧各地產價第三，二十天來本市的經濟情况，因俞蔣兩位經濟督導員和市政當局能够雷厲風行，執行限價，物價幸得大體穩定。平心而論，此廿天中的表現，全國以上海為最好。公展深望中樞於重視上海之外，能同時更注意華南華北及長江上游各大都市之物價，從而力謀產地價格與運銷價格之配合，生產成本與出售市價之調整，使上海市塲有一合理之軌道可循，將來不致因他埠堤防之潰決，而受其泛濫之影響，並不致因貨物交流之停滯，而釀成生產萎縮的結果。</p>
<p>第四，市政府前在物價動盪之際，收支不敷，七八兩月不得不求中央之補助，本市公用事業八月份因核减新價之故，亦不能不由市府設法借款，以彌補其虧負。凡此，在幣制改革之後，更應有所調整與補救。市政府乃為調整稅收之準備，並依照新幣制改編其本年九月至十二月之收支預算，以提出於此次大會，有待吾人之鄭重討論。</p>
<p>探求事實眞相　獲得公平論斷</p>
<p>最後，公展尚有願附帶一言者：即全體興局部之不同，在議論任何事件時，為一起碼應有之認織。譬如：貪汚一詞，決不能加之於所有之官史·公展不敢說上海無一貪　，無一汚史，但公展却敢說上海儘有許多茹苦含辛，潔身自好，率公守法的司法官·行政官·與軍警長官，應該受人民的尊敬與表揚。公展不敢說上海沒有故意積壓公事的衙門，但公展却敢說上海確有行政效率極高的司法機關行政機關，為友邦人士深深器重，可惜沒有受到市民的注意。又如：奸商一詞，亦斷不能加之於所有之商人。上海誠有不，少違法營私的奸商敗類，但上海究竟還是循規蹈矩將本求利以圖鍸口的商人居多。因此，公展深願本會同仁，討論任何案件，千萬勿摭拾一二事例，以偏概全，庶幾可以探求事實的眞相，獲得公平的論斷。</p>
<p>市長蔪求合作　發揚中庸之道</p>
<p>吳市長致詞略稱：參議會首次大會迄今已屆兩年，議長請參議員自問有何貢獻，本人經議長啓發後，反省兩年來工作情形，慚愧良深。回憶兩年來市府一切揹施每况態下，猶如戰事之轉緊，然各項工作尚能如期推進者，端賴於軍政黨當局之密切合作，府會一家，團結互助，不傷不倚，充分發揚中庸精神。孔子日：「修身，齊家，治國，平天下」，治國之道，亦必不脫中庸之道·在目今劃時代中欲求進步，必須各方忠誠合作，求其中庸之道，則難關始可安渡。</p>
<p>施政報告</p>
<p>揭幕典禮完成後，繼即舉行第一次大會，首由吳市長作施政報告，長達四十五分鐘，摘錄如下：</p>
<p>民政方面</p>
<p>民衆自衛隊組織實施辦法，業已擬就，自衛訓練委員會，亦已籌備就緒，惟癥結在謀如何與義勇警察配合，經費來源，為困難所在。</p>
<p>警方面</p>
<p>成立警備旅問題，中央未頒佈新經濟措施以前，需十六餘萬億元，改革幣制以後，預算需一千數百餘萬金圓，市政府將召集各有關機關會商後，提會討論。</p>
<p>社會方面</p>
<p>迄今日為止，尚有十餘處工賑所繼續辦理公賑，至興辦第二期義賣房屋，因各項工料劇漲，無法預算，未能續辦。關於戶口配米，受中美協定限制，價格祗能低於市價百分之五，為顧全市民負担，分普通配米，貧民配米及粹米三種，俾减輕市民負担。</p>
<p>敎育方面</p>
<p>甲，本市學校及班級數量，三十四年度九至十二月，計中等學校十八校，班級一七五班，國民學校八六校，班級七四三班。本年度九月，中等學校已增至三〇校，班級三八〇班，國民學校二七〇校，班級二五六二班。乙，敎育經費，三十五年上半年度佔總預算百分之八·二八，三十七年上半年度佔預算百分之二〇，實支巳為百分之二二·五七。</p>
<p>財政方面</p>
<p>本市在前租界時代，市政府，公共租界工部局，法公董局三機構每年收入總數為四千六百萬元，其中房租一項，卽達一千五百萬元·現在市政府每年稅收，金圓券決不能達九千二百萬金圓，整理稅收，實為首要。</p>
<p>工務方面</p>
<p>各項工程材料無不劇漲，工務局本年九至十二月四個月支出為七十萬金圓。以此計算，全年應為二一〇萬金圓。</p>
<p>公用方面</p>
<p>市政府，參議會及谷有關單位，已會同組織公用事業公開調查審議委員會，各位認對公用事業有加以詢問必要，儘可儘量審核，幣制改革以後，中央對全國各地公用事業價格刻已縝密商討，當有明文公佈。</p>
<p>地政方面</p>
<p>關於土地整理，市中心區已完成百分之九十以上，故今後本市稅收，地價稅將為重要項目之一。惟須物價穩定，始克有濟。</p>
<p>衛生方面</p>
<p>衛生經費甚為桔据，防疫工作賴有美援，工作方能繼續進行，本年夏季本市米發生霍亂，差堪告慰。</p>
<p>吳市長之結論，提出兩點：（一）市府當力求配合中央所訂新經濟方案，穩定物價。（二）在厲行節約之原則下，當力求預算平衡。</p>
<h3>四參議員質詢　市長逐一答復</h3>
<p>十一時半，質詢開始。吳市長逐一作答如下：關於參議員張志韓質詢，答稱：（一）减少汽車應由市府以身作則事，本人意見完全一致，決澈底執行。（二）公款送存市公庫事，市府前月業令所屬遵辦，凡應繳不繳者決以貪汚罪懲處。關於參議員張中原質詢·答稱：（一）跑罵應收歸事，實際上有所困難，收購無錢，前擬以江灣跑為塲與之交換，又為中央所不准，現正另覓土地交換中。（二）籌建美術館事，業主哈同已將地契交與地政局，現正設計打樣中。關於參議員費樹聲質詢，答稱：（一）公用事業價格由中央統一案，乃由於各地均有同樣困難，則自應由中央統一解決，地方政府唯有服從中央之命令。（二）公用事業减價後之貼補問題，現已成立價格公開調查審議委員會，如對各公司收支有增减意見時，儘可提會公開討論解決。（三）對中央頒布之經濟緊急措置，市府必盡全力配合實施，商店不論大小，查有抬價實據者一律嚴辦，望市民檢舉。關於參議員范錫品質詢，市長向鄧仲和勸募特捐時曾出示萬里浪之信件照片，以此種方式勸募，是否妥當？市長答稱：鄧案出示照片，乃因向鄧屢次勸募，僅允捐三百億，與勸募委會之目的懸殊，時逢朱政文有函件至市府，報告業已向地檢處告發，並附呈信件照片，本人以其旣有漢奸嫌擬，則與中央所訂救濟特捐規則中，凡發國難財者為勸募之主要對象一節相符，故向渠出示照片，希能自動捐款。至於漢奸罪一節，本人明知已被告發，月不必由市府越組代庖。又對范參議員質詢，市長應拿出勇氣來，渦去素來打太極拳，今後似應打打少林拳一點，市長回答簡單而又乾脆，謹謂：「才力不夠，很想學習」。答畢卽行回座，議長遂卽宣佈第一次大會散會，</p>
<h3>今午二次會議　對九局提質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日上牟休息，下午三時至七時，繼續舉行第二次會議，由參議員向財政·敎育·地政·公用·工務·警察·社會·民政·衛生各局質詢並聆取答覆。本會大會期閫會塲言論，仍由參議會主辦之新都電台隨時廣播，以便市民收聽。</p>

<h3>「復興王」　畢竟變成了階下囚犯　愚昧帝王思想亟待蕭淸　蘭州治安當局嚴予追究</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋炳林</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州六日航訊〕本月四日，蘭州高等特種刑事汪庭，宣判了一件從未公開過的特種案件，從這件事，可以反映出今日的西北的農村，還停滯在愚昧無知的「神權時代」，有許多人民的腦海裏，還潛伏着「帝王思想」。</p>
<p>亡淸後裔　被匪蠱惑</p>
<p>去年春天，在甘肅臨夏縣，有個廿三歲的靑年農民馬雲麟，他是亡淸後裔，（原名愛親覺羅蒲存）受了奸匪桑文炳和當地道士陳古漢的慫恿，協議自立為「大淸復興王」，由陳古漢任軍師，秘密集會，結識了一大批無知的鄉民，發佈「聖旨」，「勅封」出一大批「忠孝王六軍都督」，「天下兵馬大元帥」，「內廉辦事北陽大臣忠爵侯」，……及「隴東總司令」，「神武軍司令」，「營長」，「連長」等職位，多至五六十個，聲勢喧赫一時。雖然還未公開招兵買馬，但已是藏匿槍械等武器，待機暴動了。</p>
<p>圖謀不軌　全部就擒</p>
<p>去年九月間，地方當局察覺了這批圖謀不軌的黨徒，卽由第五區行政專負公署將這批「君」「臣」予以逮捕，除主動的奸黨份子桑文炳及「司令」張陶三等聞風遠颺外，計捉到「大清復與王」馬雲麟，副副司令」，「營長」，「連長」何應乾，（五十六歲，業農，永靖人），魯得禮（卅四歲，菜農，臨夏人），孔海洲，（五十六歲，業農，永靖人），石國有（四十一歲，業農，臨夏人），石優存（四十五歲，業農，臨夏人），趙元璧（卅二歲，無業，渭源人）等六名，並格斃「軍師」陳古漢，當塲搜出了不質的「大淸復興王印」，（長九公分，寬六公分），「內廉辦事北陽大臣忠爵侯印」（長十三公分，寬八·五公分）印章兩顆，黃綢精裱的「聖旨」七道，能戮兩塊，望遠鏡一個，刺刀一把，廢折腰槍，八音手槍各一枝，手槍，步槍彈共五粒。旋卽押解甘省保安司令部，經過長時期的偵訊，乃於本年七年間，轉解特種刑事法庭，提起公訴，日前予以判決。</p>
<p>階下羣囚　縮做一團</p>
<p>昔日喧赫一時的「復興王」及其僚屬們，如今成了顫抖一團的階下囚，靜聆着審判長宣讀判決主文：「馬雲麟共同意圖破壞國體，而預備以暴動着手實行，處有期徒刑七年，褫奪公權七年。何應乾，孔海洲，魯得禮，石國有，石優存，趙元璧，共同意岡破壞國體，而預備以暴動着手實行，各處有期徒刑四年，褫奪‘公權四年。李五斤無罪，……印章，聖旨……均沒收。」</p>
<p>怪劇導演　各逞野心</p>
<p>這　一復辟」怪劇的導演者，是奸匪桑文炳，企圖擾亂西北的治安，而「軍師」陳古漢，則是想籍這個機會，歉一些錢。可憐這批受人利用的「王」及其「奴才」們，旣做了傀儡，又要坐牢。他們對記者訴苦說：「咳，我們雙手畫不成八字，還知道做王嗎？這都是死了的老道支配的。今天判處我們徒刑，真寃枉！我們要聲請覆判！」那種愚蓋的樣子，那種哀憐的表情，和那些封建氣息十足的「王」，「侯」，「聖旨」等字眼，隔離得太遙遠了，太遙遠了！</p>
<p>神水傳說　深入窮鄕</p>
<p>在甘肅各地，目前盛行着所謂「孔月敎」，「一貫道」等的非法組織，一般無知的鄉愚，趨之若驚，地方當局雖常常查禁，無如這些勢力都潛入到窮鄉僻壞的下曆階級裏，利用神道設敎的幌子活動，不易查覺。據本地報載：甘肅隴西一度袋現「紳水」，據說喝了可以醫治百病，甚至數十年的宿疾，男男女女成羣結隊的去汲「紳水」，縣政府怕奸匪利用此一時搬，擾亂地方治安，遂令縣衛生院和隴西師範化學敎員化騐，證明道種水含有硫磺，能治病，完全是科舉的效果。因此迷信傳說，發生動搖，「神」也建逸而不靈了。</p>
<p>漳縣隴西　妖言仍熾</p>
<p>但這「神」並不消聲　跡，最近又竄到漳縣和隴西灘兒下，這兩地跟着又發生玄虛的傳說：「不知何處來的妖怪，於夜深人靜時俞剪鷄翅膀，後來直剪到小孩子的身上來！「人們聽了這些傳說，疑信參半，孩子們身上佩起紅布條，大門頂上貼起紅紙褲，甚至在窗前放一盆淸水，預備呌「妖怪」不慎時跌入永盆。在戡亂時期，這種無稽的傳說，盼治安當局作澈底的追究，社會敎育工作，也更應該加强，否則愚昧的人民，難怪要被陰謀家及運士們任意擾佈了。</p>
<h3>審陽武裝運毒　官匪雙方激戰</h3>
<p>兩獲鴉片三千餘兩</p>
<p>〔本報桂林九日訊〕本月二日，賓陽縣戴獲武裝運毒一批，緣有烟匪一帮，二日由百色過該縣，爲官兵攔截，雙方激戰半小時，匪潰散，計鹵獲雅片三千六百兩。</p>

<h3>浙四十一縣水災</h3>
<p>社會處請中央撥賑款</p>
<p>〔本報杭州七日訊〕連日　雨滂沱，浙各縣水災甚重，社會處據報者已達四十一縣，除派員查察外，並再向中央請撥救濟款項</p>
<h3>揚聯防隊員五人　被泰縣鄕長逮捕</h3>
<p>揚縣府提出嚴重抗議</p>
<p>〔本報江都七日訊〕本縣第四聯防軍事處隊員嚴嘲·李正才等五人，於上月十一日在揚泰邊境活動，被泰縣莊姚鄉長嚴海秋非法逮捕，並繳去短槍五枝，元麥四十石，誣有强刦嫌疑，於酷刑逼供後解縣，收押泰縣地檢處偵訊，江都縣府迭電保釋，未予接受，廿八日嚴嘲以傷重瘦斃，李正才等刻又重病獄中，生命垂危，本縣縣府以泰縣縣府故意為難，縱屬非刑拷打公務員致死，除呈報專員公署外，並派自衛總隊副總隊長王世淸會同參議員薛光祖赴泰澈查，嚴重抗議。又本縣海山鄉長蔡智元，傳又在泰被捕，查無踪跡。</p>
<h3>革命元動　趙舒病逝縉雲</h3>
<p>〔　雲六日訊〕革命元動趙舒，於九月五日上午四時廿分病逝縉雲衛生院。氏享壽六十四歲，早年追隨國父，奔走革命，參加倒袁護法之役，北伐時任二十六軍黨代表，抗戰時為國民參政員，不辭辛勞，正氣磅簿。平生不治家產，身後蕭條。</p>
<h3>冀秋禾豐收　農和物陸續登場</h3>
<p>〔本報保定七日訊〕冀省秋禾豊收，各區農作物已陸續登塲。冀中附近稍受虫災，收穫减少三成，平津唐附近各縣均收六成，榖類玉蜀黍佔大宗。</p>
<h3>廣九路出軌後　漏夜趕修完竣</h3>
<p>〔本報香港六日航訊〕廣九鐵路第一三二公里李朗與布吉兩站之間，於本月三日下午五時許，發生第七次快車出軌慘劇，死廿八人，傷九十餘人，實為該路有史以來之空前巨變。粵漢路杜局長鎭遠，偕同粵建設廳謝廳長文龍，於五日下午五時許，親往視察。據杜局長談：此次發生行車事變，死傷枕藉，深用惻然。經實地勘察後，證明肇事責任，完全由於奸匪破壞，蓋出軌處之枕木係新換之暹羅硬枕，絕無朽爛情事，路基亦無坍鬆現象，出軌處之鋼軌及魚尾板未斷，最重要之證明，卽為聯接肇事處兩節鋼軌之魚尾板及螺栓，遍覓不獲，該兩節鋼軌接駁處，亦無扭曲痕跡，顯係在出軌前此二節鋼軌已失却聯繫，魚尾板及螺栓實由奸匪事先移去，毫無疑問。路局鑒於港穗交通，未便停頓，經漏夜趕工修路，六日起全綫已照常通車，行車時間暫照九月一日以前之四時三十分實行，以策安全。</p>

<h3>商業行莊移存外匯　展延至今午截至　昨申報登記單位在三百以上</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市商業行莊及保險信託業外匯移存央行之申報登記工作，原限於昨日午後四時辦毅，惟因限於事實，決定延至今日正午截止。昨日申報登記之單位在三百以上，規模較大之行莊公司，幾巳全數完成申報登記手續。有若干小行莊則因不熟錯手續，表格填寫頗多因不合規定而退回重辦者。登記表今日收齊後，由林局長崇　於今夜晋京，呈請財部審核，再由部令公佈全部詳細數字。</p>
<p>〔中失社南京九日電〕財次徐柏圖，前為行莊外匯資產移存國行事赴滬，今晨公畢返京。據告記者稱：上海各商業銀行均運守政府法令，自八日起分向中央銀行申報，定九日下午四時以前截止，大致應無問題。如有不遵守法令，尚敢延不申報者，政府將予以相當處分。關於移存之外匯總數，則尚在彙集報告中，其總數或不致如外問所傳之鉅。徐氏又稱：目前欲求經濟趨於穩定，政府固盡力貫澈旣定政策，然亦有賴於民衆之心理安定，對於貨幣發生信心。</p>
<h3>店方添納依然不多　食米趨勢下游　雜糧油市均轉見挫落</h3>
<p>米市再見萎縮，市勢續向下游。錫市報價不振，米店添納依舊不多，加之天晴，到貨可望增多，故開市雖平，收市終仍因去路呆木，及人心之不振而稍見退落。南市塲早稱跌三角，白粳薄稱各挫三角，新羊秈以二十元開出，新粳亦見回低，獨白元貨缺之故，仍堅站限價。北市塲價格尚定，但市亦殊疲，二市到貨三千零二十石。</p>
<p>麵粉交易不多，價稍下疲，最多者下跌不到一角，因報載麵粉亦屬禁止出境者，則內地零銷勢必斷絕，因此人心轉疲，納戶减少。老車開盤站上日原價，收市略低二分，兵船七元二角收盤，計降五分，雜牌粉銷路殊呆，下降四五分。建成紛低九分，麩皮傳廠方將開，略疲二分，小麥站原盤。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市勢轉疲，黃豆客銷已絕，油廠納胃亦減，新豆本街納胃亦不佳，市呈疲象。苞米靑島帮添辦較多，加砌一角。紅糧北銷暢通，高升次定。元麥次貨酒精廠有去化，價挫，茶豆及蠶豆成交均少，芝蔴，主仁，各按限價成交，前者堅而後者疲。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>平疲，豆油及生菜油略見挫落，本街存貨大都充足，故向市上納取者不多。油廠開價低二角，大統豆油四十九元五角，生菜油削五角，為四十五元五角。生油因靑島已禁止出口，存底又薄，致市氣仍堅。小車蔴油因存底枯竭，市亦堅昂，開淨小車五十元。豆餅客帮依然無胃，廠價四元六角，回籠貨削低一角。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局江陵輪，昨日下午抵埠，自長沙運來食米四千包，桐油四百五十桶，現泊金利源碼起卸。</p>
<p>又訊：長江綫近因航運路見起色，江陵·江寗·三北瑞泰等輪，均有大批紗布日用品，運往漢湘。</p>
<h3>金銀外幣　昨日收兌統計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日來央行及委託銀行收兌金銀外幣數字，較之最初數日，頗見低落。昨日則成績特優，全部收兌數額如下：</p>

<p>港鈔一九二，二〇〇·〇五元</p>
<p>總值為金圓券九，二〇四，四一八，九四五元。</p>

<h3>省市銀行短期拆放　前分佈六項辦法取消</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於省市地方銀行，如因事實需要，對當地業務正常之行莊予以短期拆款一點，財部曾規定六項辦法，現悉自加强金融業務管制辦法修正公佈後，對省市銀行存放同菜款項，已有嚴格之限制，所有財部原定之六項辦法，已由財部明令廠止。</p>
<h3>上週週出口貨結匯數</h3>
<p>上週（八月廿九日至九月四日）上海一埠出口物資申請結匯金額，較前週稍减，全部數字折合美金四，一七五，二一七·一三元。其中包括政府自行結匯（卽冰蛋·紗布·礦砂·食糖等）出口物資·計美金一，〇三二，五三七·七三元。</p>
<h3>日絲織品將銷印度　威脅我印市場</h3>
<p>絲織協導會決卽出清存貨</p>
<p>中央銀行為增加輸出，換取外匯，去年曾領導組織絲織外銷協導委員會，業將政府掌握之生絲，加工外銷。綢緞九萬餘疋先行運印銷售，業已銷三分之一，尚存三分之二，本月十日後，印度禁止生絲及絲織織品進口令，定能解除·日本絲及絲織品，將運銷印度，我在印市塲，將受嚴重之威脅，所有該批綢緞，自應早日出售，以利結束。</p>
<p>關於此事，絲織外銷協導會，特於昨日邀集有關機關，會商處理辦法，中央銀行業務局副局長陳述曾，襄理馬季平，中國銀行副理孫祖瑞，中信局專員周大剛，蠶絲公司總經理葛敬中，及絲織業代表等十餘人，均出席商談，結果決在最近期內將印存貨出淸，其出售價格，以實際成太計算為原則，過去運印綢緞，係限價出售，每碼以四歲比以上為最低價，現當在四盧比以下云。</p>
<h3>供應不絕敵碼充裕　棉紗市價平疲　永安紗廠昨首次參加配紗</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因值秋銷時令，互做頗不寂寞，各方人心尚形堅穩，市上各紗廠供源不絕，客帮則去胃呆鈍，且有反進為出者，粗細紗價大都跌進限度，交易已入正軌。</p>
<p>又訊：永安紡織公司，委託紗商業公會開售十支至六十支各牌紗四百包，公會於下午三點，用抽籤方式開售與各會員，不諭以前有無交易，俱依號次抽籤，每一會員得配一包，價款於十一日上午十一點前，以本票掉換棧單。</p>
<p>計開十支嘉禾一百四十包，價四百八十八元。卅二支金城一百二十包，價八百卅元。四十支金城六十包，價八百五十九元。四十支雙股金城四十包，價一千零三十元。六十支雙股金城四十包，價為一千二百五十元云。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以盛傳限運出口，客帮無法裝運，並聞有客莊辦貨，須要當地同業公會證明，方可採購之說，因此塲內賣氣益形濃厚，執貨者吐售甚多。又逢紡建公司配售之期，供應尤暢，本街店莊實銷雖旺，人心終難樂觀。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，開盤卽告下挫九角，卒以廿八元站住，比上日續跌八角之鉅。其他各稀布疋，因紡建公司配價照市面略低，故亦都見跟瀉，惟跳鲤元嗶嘰有人搜求，市獨堅秀，色布及士林布仍站原盤，全日成交儿百六十疋。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例開布，結果共書布一四三四〇疋，被單五四〇條，申購者共二五七戶，內廠家二六戶，購布四八八〇疋，布號二三一戶，購布九四六〇疋，被單五四口條。紡　共收價款三五〇，八一〇元。</p>
<p>又該公司今日以改組關係，暫停開紗一天。所有該日復製業應配之紗，決於十三日補配。</p>
<h3>呢絨營業額增加</h3>
<p>羢業各商號，　來門售始終照常供應，且近日營業額較八月十九日前增加數倍·至批發减少之原因，則以廠方配貨額不數供應，門售不得不臨减，　批各貨，售價正常。</p>
<h3>一月來紗布外鈔愛　　換取印棉八萬噸</h3>
<p>據舫織品外銷委員會消息：該會生持紗布易印棉事，自七月份至現在止，先後共已易得印棉八萬噸，而我國所運出之紗布共為四萬五千件。依照此次比例，對國內各紡織廠原棉之調劑，有極大補益，尤其在靑黃不接之時，國內各紗廠幾已全以紡織印棉為主，在新花紗布協導委員會成立後，該項以紗布易印棉事，將特別加强云</p>
<h3>半夏路不暢</h3>
<p>國藥半夏，新貨業已在途中，聞今年川地產額與往年相同，浙東實陽產額較上年略為遜色，東　區產量以佃農流浪他鄉，多數未曾起土，產額大為减少，不及往年十分之一。近來市塲上　貨去化不暢，退入限價以下，為一百五十八元。惟揀統兩檔銷活，堅站限價。桃仁杏仁蛀性時期脫意轉濃，價遂傾瀉，為五十九元五角，仍有下跌之勢。米仁浦城產量亦告歉收。</p>
<h3>吐納缺乏變化　內銷茶交易淸稀</h3>
<p>連日以來，內銷茶因進出互有，依然缺乏變化，至於洋莊茶市，趨勢迭吐秀氣。揆諸原因，各貨存底益枯，又以產區炒靑烘靑等毛茶步砌，貨方感於此後複製成本高昂，是以供應旣稀，而喊價則不餒。但輸出商胃納尚悅，過程遂呈供不應求之象，交易淸寂，市氣卒告進展。頃據業中人談稱，暢銷北菲蔚為大宗之珍眉綠茶等，目前法國經濟使節團，甚加靑睞，假如展開買風，勢將一掃而空，　察前途，堪稱樂觀。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>食糖人心虛，紛紛出龍，吐售十七期粗砂棧單，做二八元，現貨為二八元六角，各跌一元光量。車白精與中砂亦先後跌進限價，前者三〇元五角，後者二六元三角，土糖依限績有做開。</p>
<p>綢梁公會，頃巳商定由大誠，華强，各配六百條，美亞，錦孫，各配三百條，共計一千八百條，全部依照八一九限價大三六元七角，配予該會開售組各會員。</p>
<p>木材交易，仍呈平靜，據傅產地杉木，價格仍昂，每尺約為九分半至一角一分。</p>
<p>昨最捲烟市况：各烟均在限度內略有成交，各廠商派貨較多，同業門市各烟暢銷，肥皂略秀，因門銷抵補較多，各皂較昨略高三角至五角，計固本皂二六元五角，祥茂皂二〇元五角，均有成交。</p>

<h3>平研究院學術會議　胡適李書華等致詞</h3>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕北平研究院學術研究會議今晨開幕，李石曾代表吳稚暉主席，該院十九週年紀念會合併舉行，出席北方會員四三人。李石曾致開會辭，追述我國之研究院始於民十八年。副院長李書華報告概况，歷述該院之物理·鐳學·化學·藥物·生理·動物·植物·史學及西北植物調查所等九研究所工作。</p>
<p>李書華指出　研究所成績</p>
<p>並特別指出　學研究所已改為原子研究所，由錢三强兼任所長，物理研究所製造光學儀器，以應各方需要，藥物研究所現已鑑定「常山鹹」所含三種同質異性分子之抗瘧性特强，超過金鷄納霜一百倍至二千倍。李氏稱：戰後因經費奇少，影響工作甚大，此點希政府注意及之，並强調中國學人應負起世界責任之一部分。該院下午討論研究院制度問題，選吳稚陣任主席。</p>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕平研院學術會議今揭幕，胡適梅貽琦與平研院物理研究所所長嚴濟慈，相繼致詞。</p>
<p>胡適之主張　增設研究院</p>
<p>（一）胡適：渠以為中國如此之大，除中央研究院外，只平研院一地方研究院，實感太少。故主張至少應在滬·穗·蓉各都市，浙江·西南·西北各地方，皆設研究院。胡氏稱贊平研院在十九年之短期聞，而有六百多篇論文，其成續在世界上也算得優異。因之感慨中國之有近代大學及研究機關才五六十年，並謂歷史甚短，而且普遍鬧窮，但只要苦幹，中國學術之發展，仍有燦爛遠景。</p>
<p>博士授與法　應促其生效</p>
<p>胡氏提倡研究所應收徒弟，譴責政府於民二二年制就博士學位授與法，而從未生效，致十餘年來，無人能自國內獲得博士學位。渠且反對由政府一手包辦，而應由設有研究所之大學授庚。胡氏請予曾參與北大淸華考選碩士，皆可證明其程度決不次於外國之博士。政府應相信此事實。故渠最近赴京，除出席中研院士會外，決向政府提出此項建議，尤希辦大學出身之張伯苓院長促成之。</p>
<p>梅貽琦強調　學術無區域</p>
<p>（二）梅貽琦調研究學術不應有區域觀念，並應注意培植後進，謂中國現從事學術研究者不過幾百人，最後希大家精誠合作。（三）嚴濟慈：嚴氏指出今天從事學術研究者，比十年前多了三四十倍，而設備越來越少了。</p>

<p>自由談胖話  老劉　　十三四年前我剛從大學畢業出來時，戰事尚未發生，家境也還算寬裕，那時我的體重是一百零七磅，體育界前輩馬約翰老師拍拍我的肩膀道：「孩子，你太輕了一點。吃東西，多吃點東西！」　　今天，我算是找到了一個吃不飽餓不死的小差使，每天忙得不亦樂乎，還要常受閑氣，而且有妻有子，負擔自然也加重了不少。然而——奇哉，我的體重竟然變為一百八十七磅，儼然成為寫字間裏的頭號大胖子了！　　每在街頭碰到朋友們，他們必然笑嘻嘻地對我說：「啊，又比以前胖了！心廣體胖，身發財發，老兄春風得意呀！」　　前天，我們一級的大學同學在校友會聚餐。有一位是剛從北平來的，我們十多年沒見面了。大家寒暄起來，他說，「大家都還是老樣十，就是老劉——一他指指我笑着說，「老劉，我要是在街上碰着您，可簡直不敢招呼您了。多年不見，變成這樣「偉大』，眞是意想不到。」　　老實說，我自己也覺得意想不到。看看以前的照片，瘦瘦的，長長的，有些楊小樓的神氣；現在呢，唉！不能不承認，很有些郝壽臣的派頭了。說境遇罷，這十幾年來幾曾有過像大學裏那種無憂無慮的日子？飛機在頭上掃射，等一會去看看瓦楞裏全是彈榖。家裏的經濟情形也大不如前了。租米是顆粒無收，倒碰到了好幾次賊偷。自己從沒有找到過一個差强人意的職務，倒是荒疎了那麼多年，連大學裏讀過的東西都已經忘了一大半。十幾年「混」來「混」去，忽然「混」成一個大胖子了，實在有些希奇　　昨天在同居的一位先生家裏看見，一本紐約先鋒論壇報的每週增刋，內有一文，題曰：「你是否太胖？」一見之下，不禁怦然心動，連忙借來躺在牀上細讀一過，發現了一個我所急於知道的答案——據專家們說，體胖不必心廣，發福無關發財；反之，倒是心境愈不愉快，發胖的機會愈多。　　譬如，美國康奈爾大學醫學院敎授戈爾德博士（Dr，HarryGold）說：「肥胖的原因往往是心境不好。一般人在心裏不快活的時候，常常喜歡吃東西，說是可以解悶消愁，結果就養成了一種多吃東西的習慣。這個習慣是不容易戒除的，非用心理治療協助不可。」　　平格博士（Dr．Carl　Binger）說：「大多數胖子之所以發胖是為了吃得太多。為甚麼吃得多呢？因為他們常常覺得飢餓。而飢餓的原因，往往是為了焦急。憂慮不安的人是常常會覺得肚子餓的。一　　憂慮令人多吃，道個話不能說沒有道理。荷馬的史詩「伊利奧特」裏描寫武士們於追悼戰死的同袍時不勝悲哀，但在追悼的儀式完畢之後立刻大吃大喝，荷馬用許多詩句來描寫他們怎樣整治盛筵，怎樣酒醉飯飽。我當年讀到此處不禁為之一笑，到現在看來倒實在是阿爾道斯·赫克斯萊（Aldous　Huxley）所謂『全般眞實」（The　whole　turth）子。　　前幾天讀到一　某先生的回憶錄，說是袁世凱身被龍袍之後，漸知形勢不對，一天早起披閱電報，一看大局已到了無可挽救的地步，不禁想得出神——右手拿着電報，左手便把放在旁邊當早點的饅頭一個一個望嘴裏送：一吃竟吃了八十幾個饅頭！　　荷馬筆下的武士是否胖子尚待考證，可是想來未必會瘦；袁世凱的尊範是在洋錢上見識過了：胖的。　　莎士比亞筆下的人物之中，「丹麥王子哈孟雷德」可以算是憂鬱的了，而歐洲專門研究莎士比亞的學者們說：一哈孟雷德可能有花柳病－他是一個胖子。」　　再看看發財的人們罷。要我財主自然就要到美國。好，你看去年逝世的福特的照片。福特可謂富矣，却是一個骨瘦如柴的乾癟老頭子！煤油大王洛基斐勒呢？也是瘦的！不要說別的了，大家知道美國人有錢，可是美國的象微山姆叔叔不就是一位留着山羊鬍子的瘦老頭麼？　　寫到此地，不禁立起來照了一照鏡子。其胖如故——悲夫！論癖好  何苦　　人生貴有癖好。　　人們需要一個正常的職業，為了要維特生活；也需要一種或數種癖好，為了要調劑生活，或者藝術化地說，為了要裝飾生活，正如要用窗帘來裝飾玻璃會一樣。　　正常的職業如人們的一對眸于，而癖好是生長於眸子外圍的睫毛。睫毛的功用不但裝飾了明眸，且可以防止塵埃侵入眼膜。人生亦復如是。生活中雜了砂泥，會使你感到憂　煩惱，唯一可以防止塵埃來侵入生活的眼膜者，便是癖好。　　原來我們平日所從事的職業，當初次踏進屬於這個職業的辦）公室裏時，你填寫的志願醫上卽使有一興趣所屬，願意作為終身事業」等字樣，積年累月之後，終有不免感到厭倦的一天。民間有「吃一行，寃一行」的俗語，乃是經騐累積而得的結論。何以會矢志興趣於先，到頭來終有感到「寃煞」的一天？其關鍵便在於你所從事的職業，一旦成為維持生活的手段時，便像一種米磨粉的工作，而尊駕便是旋轉磨石的一匹驢子。「苦恨年年壓針綫，為他人作嫁衣裳！」這是驢子的吶喊。　　關於驢子磨粉，我們旅行到小城市裏，就可以遇到這一幅單調的晝面。眼睛上被遮住了屏障的一匹驢子，拴住在磨石的扶柄上，咿咿呀呀地旋轉於這個小圈圈中，是多麼單調的一樁苦工！昔年有一個長工，他所做的正是代替一匹驢子的工作——每天磨粉，其寫回去的家信便是多隱俞的牢騷：「帽如海，襪如江，足不出門，日行千里，若有使船，徒步回家。」後面兩句，表示長工的收入菲薄，要想回家，非等有便船下鄉，當一名縴夫為人家拉船歸來也。為了糊口而從事的職業，不免要生寃恨，乃是宇宙間的通例例；然而我們必需糊口，正常的職業旣無法擺脫，於是只有追求調劑之道，那便要提倡癖好了。　　某人的　好，也許在他人看來，是一種「寃煞」的職業，但因為有這種好癖的人，不屬於驢子磨粉的工作，因此便是調劑生活的樂事了。故羅斯福總統在日理萬機之餘，以釣魚為調劑身心之道，垂釣便成為羅氏的癖好，雖然在「捕魚人兒世世窮」的漁夫目光中，垂釣便是一種重負的工作。　　嗜賭之士在辦公室裏，沒精打彩，一遇到四人凑滿一桌，就顯得精神百倍，雖卜書而卜夜，亦並無倦容，所謂「骨牌一響，眼目淸凉。」不過我們反對癖好的沈酒，因為沈湎其中之後，廢時失業，流入玩物喪志的麼道，其行徑便不再是健康性的了。　　所以癖好一定要落入「好癖」的範疇之內，這樣才有助於正常的職業，它必須要像機器油一般，使人們獲得以後，可以使正常的工作圓潤進展，減輕折磨的困擾。　　因此我說：人生貴有擗好。美國點滴  咸斯　　國際難民組織成立後的八個月中，遺送回國的難民計六七·〇七八人，受該組織協助而留居在外國的難民計一九二·四九四人。　　美國國務卿年薪一萬五千美元，但馬歇爾做國務卿却完全是義務性質，不受薪水。原來他以退職陸軍上將的資格，已終身可得年薪一萬五千七百五十一元，而且依法他也不能同時支取兩筆官薪。來函　　（一）胡亞光先生來函：「日前發表抽作「張子祥與馮超然」一文，係於席上聞諸父老談及中外諸成功人之幼年史，一時興到，卽在『英雄不怕出身低』的原則下，不假思索的寫寄本欄。按馮先生係余生平服曆之一人，初無絲毫作用也。茲除謹向馮光生致無上歉意外，並請代為更正（六）　　（二）市衛生局來函：「查閱八月廿二日貴報「自由談』刊載「垃圾」來稿一則，以本市溧陽路九三〇弄垃圾堆積，有碍衛生等語，當經飭據淸潔總隊查復：『該弄八號劉宅，因修理房屋，致有多量三合土傾棄弄內，並非垃圾，業經飭夫軍除完竣。』等情，相應函請查照披露為荷。（下略）一避役  公孫午　　白居易新豐折臂翁詩，曾有人列為反戰文學，中學國文敎科書亦載之。彼時軍閥混戰，民間有反戰呼聲，今日視之，誠陳迹也。現行之妨害兵役治罪條例云：「煽惑他人避免兵役者，平時處三年以下有期徒刑，戰時處一年以上，七年以下有期徒刑。」故雖談詩論古，不可不慎。前條例又云：「故意毀傷身體者，處三年以下有期徒刑。」畏法者當不敢效新豐翁所為。新豐翁之折臂，必深夜愉為之，其自知不法明矣。唐律疏義謂：「或有誣告人罪，以求推對；或故犯輕法，竟在流連；或故自傷殘；或詐為疾患。一是唐時避役者，人多而術巧，政府已嚴為之防矣。或日，彼寗願失一臂者，豈懼數年徒刑？設有自斷手足而復受刑者，刑期滿後，終其身不能使服兵役也。法固有時而窮，愛國心重則人人自奮，自殘以圖免役之事，竟無所聞。故齊之以刑，不如道之以德。雲間題蘭小品摘存續（上）  棘蘭　　有小人，然後見君子，然君子者不絕物，和而不同，淸芬自遠（一）常熟素　　有為洛下人求寫蘭於雲間先生，謂須精妙，將以奉新貴人；先生曰：此公數斤肉耳（一）可多買青紅，求時史畫牡丹。其人日：我則何如？日：微有骨，宜得一筆。　　集圓　　廣塲飯鷄，閒侍吾母，頃見鷄已飽臥蕉蔭矣，遂理紙　，以報雅意絕塵之貺！戊子六月白焦為礽光老兄寫集圓。　　蕙永春梅　　蘭有名大富貴者，雲問愛其花而惡其名；　有名大一品者，雲間以為無傷云。　　　　　秀奇開士一日為居士言黃山蕙，葉長一拓，香聞十里，居士固巳心往矣。今日用大筆寫巨幅，開士視之曰：正是瀑梁一角寫實，居士以何時入山者？雲問記事。　　露根蘭　　　答春光，盧遂在泥中，故作此態，會心不遠，希並示阿萇，當得勇決，願我　中良苦！　　　　　楚雖有才，脅實川之；伸尼在里，一東家丘耳－十步之內，必有芳草，世視昏昏，誰復見者？寫之歎惋！　　大一品　　幽芬已逸，不知且夕出山，使人間見此一品！　　上海梅　　山妻不知於何處檢得一紙，視而匿笑；會我釋卷，張之目前，曰：此君子昔年畫菲菜也！今加茁壯，遂名之曰蘭耳。居士曰：若我寫黃山梅，夫人必以為是蒲蘆類耳，少所見，乃多所怪，古今同病！其實居士未至黃山，僅僅聞上人言也，呵呵！復翁補空。　　澗闌　　中原茂草，僻澗有籣，我不爾觀，言以永歎！　　月珮　　酷署夜不得眠，而晨凉有　散之趣，煮一甌茶，細細研墨，伸紙捉筆，樂婦孺在夢中，且無早客相溷。得此，遂以寄我曦明悔外，觸熱人未得見也！　　　　　　春風如舊，蘭言相忘，東山雲氣，共入君子之堂！　　棘蘭　　東坡翁寫　，雜以　棘，意謂君子能容小人也；復翁則正目荆棘爲護芳使者，去問思靑翁，當為首。戊子盛夏，雨後小凉，忽動淸興，寫此漫題。　　翠蓋荷　　半日不對客，得數本關，并忘見似人而喜矣！寄與遠翁淸賞。施髯若見，當為軒　。　　盆蘭　　午酒未醒，手浮眼小，定交嚴阿，遂得此幀。請不以藝事相是非，當為天下惜此寳！　　楊素荷　　或傳鋤蘭之訊，「夏」室生寒，，思肖翁無土之歎，異時同痛！　　睛　　　我寫意耳，如何便循俗軌求著色？試於閑寂中味之，不見相對欲吐語耶？應作何報言，我已知之，一噱！　　雙叢山籣　　眾口食貧，兒戲至此，某媼云：若得餞雲問生手，我老無憂矣！雲間生云：然更多小兒女則何如？若是金手，亦斷斷　脫贈耳！白舊戲筆。　　簡筆關　　人欲求多而子欲求少，人欲煎迫而子曰姑徐徐云爾，謂非香祖知己，故已是蘭王一喜！　　荆棘　　　散木生與我情　，　我百年御墨一，云：所得唯二，其一將自存遺。誠使我素馨生色荆　之外，而湛然此心，江上　　無徒矣！社會服務申報與　　濟華醫院　紅十字會醫院　　人和醫院　尚賢婦孺醫院　　保黎醫院　憲生產科醫院　　「讀者助產」核准產婦　徴求人才　　（一）某錬油廠微男性礦油錬油技師一人，（二）徐州某修械廠　男性修械技術負二人，（三）某機關微女性中（萬能式）英文打字員一人，（四）准安路某宅徽男性英文補習　師一人（須英美留學生）（五）某防水織物廠徵男性雨衣業汕漆建　五金業跑街各一人，凡願應徵上項工作者請親至本市四川北路八五六號社會部上海職業介紹所面洽（時間關係應徵者以居住本市為限）　　〔又訊〕中華職業敎育社上海職業指導所，近受浙江天台某中學之委託，物色理化敎負一人，需大學理工學院畢業，又史地敎員一人，需大學史地學系畢業，均需有敎學經驗而通江浙語言者為合格，凡願應徵者，卽請往雁蕩路八十號該所治。</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Constitutional Supervision Committee: The President Encourages All Members to Assist the Government in Alleviating the People's Suffering and Leading the Nation to Prosperity and Strength</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] The Constitutional Supervision Committee held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Hall on the 9th at 10:20 AM. 1,170 committee members attended, presided over by Chairman Mo Dehui and Vice Chairman Hong Lanyou. Both the President and Vice President were present, making it the grandest event at the Assembly Hall since the closing of the National Assembly. First, Mo Dehui delivered the opening remarks, stating that he was extremely excited about the establishment of the committee and the enthusiastic participation of all members. He especially noted the presence of the President and Vice President as an unparalleled honor for the committee. Currently, over 2,900 committee members have registered to participate. The committee's mission is twofold: to supervise the government's implementation of constitutional governance and to cooperate with compatriots to assist in its promotion, thereby achieving the goal of democratic politics. The committee's work is roughly divided into three areas: (1) constitutional research, (2) investigation of constitutional governance work, and (3) promotion of constitutional governance. All are extremely important. The future success of constitutional advancement and the satisfactory achievement of democratic politics depend heavily on the responsibility of this committee. Especially at a time when constitutional government and suppression of rebellion are being carried out simultaneously, the efforts of all committee members are essential. After Mo's speech, the President was invited to speak. The President wore a traditional Chinese robe and mandarin jacket, similar to the attire he wore on the day he assumed the presidency. The President first pointed out that today marks the third anniversary of Japan's surrender, and the establishment of the committee is announced today. He expressed his deep satisfaction that, in the three months since the closing of the National Assembly, the representatives have continued to uphold the spirit of the National Assembly, assisting the government in achieving the tasks of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. He then encouraged all committee members to uphold the principle that the people and the government share the same fate, and to assist the government in alleviating the people's suffering and leading the nation to prosperity and strength. The speech lasted five minutes. At 10:40 AM, the ceremony concluded. Before the members departed, Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, announced that the committee would hold its first meeting on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the President's Speech</h3>
<p>The full text of the President's speech at the meeting is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, Vice Chairman, and all members: Implementing constitutional governance is the ultimate goal of nation-building throughout our Founding Father Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life. For decades, the entire nation, both internally adhering to the Founding Father's aspirations and externally responding to global trends, has strived tirelessly. With the completion of the constitution and the establishment of a solid foundation, the first session of the National Assembly, established in accordance with the constitution, was convened this spring. Subsequently, the Legislative and Supervisory branches held meetings successively, and the nation entered the path of constitutional governance. We could have followed this smooth path to focus on advancing the work of nation-building, to catch up with the prosperity of democratic nations. However, the Communists, relying on their violence, launched a full-scale rebellion, and the harm has deepened, causing increasing suffering to the people. It is the government's responsibility to punish wrongdoing, comfort the people, and stabilize the foundation of the nation, and therefore, it must actively suppress the rebellion to eliminate this national scourge. Suppressing the rebellion militarily is no different from continuing the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, which is a matter of national survival and honor. The government recently decisively reformed the currency system, ending the malignant inflation of the legal tender to eliminate economic threats. It also actively investigates Communist spies behind the lines to eliminate the sources of chaos and stabilize the localities. All these measures are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and of great benefit to the military suppression of the rebellion. The sooner the military suppression of the rebellion is pacified and concluded, the more urgently we can implement constitutional governance and build the nation. Your committee was organized and established based on the resolution of the National Assembly. All committee members are representatives of the people, coming from the grassroots. They have a particularly detailed understanding of the people's suffering, and their sincerity in caring for the people and serving the nation can be seen from their enthusiastic participation in the constitutional supervision work. The people, the nation, and the government are originally one entity, sharing the same fate. Only through mutual trust and assistance, with seamless unity of spirit, can government measures achieve twice the result with half the effort, can the people's suffering be easily alleviated, and can national prosperity be readily achieved. The path of constitutional governance has countless intricacies. At the beginning, it is inevitable that there will be obstacles. It is hoped that all committee members will uphold their loyalty to the nation, bear in mind the difficulties of the nation, and provide more assistance to the government's policies. How should we implement new initiatives and carry out constitutional governance during the period of suppressing the rebellion, so that we can assist and complement each other? And how should we remedy the shortcomings of the current constitution, so that it can be perfected? I hope you will carefully study and present detailed recommendations for our consideration, so that we can work together to establish a good democratic constitutional government, realize the Three Principles of the People, and place the nation on a rock-solid foundation. Let us encourage each other. On the occasion of the establishment of the committee, I express my sincere thoughts. I hope you will understand.</p>
<h3>The President Summoned Weng and Others to Review Financial and Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] President Chiang Kai-shek summoned Premier Weng Wenhao, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun, and Vice Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan to his official residence at noon on the 9th. He inquired about the implementation of the recent emergency financial and economic decrees and raised some important current financial and monetary measures for review. Yu Hongjun and Xu Baiyuan arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 9th and reported to the President on the situation of supervising the reporting and registration of foreign exchange and gold and silver deposited in various commercial banks and firms in Shanghai to the Central Bank. Weng, Wang, Yu, and Xu spent over two hours at the President's official residence, and had lunch with the President before leaving at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Premier Weng's Tea Party to Host Members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, With Many Focusing on the Treatment of Public Servants and Teachers</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] Premier Weng Wenhao held a tea party at the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense at 4:00 PM on the 9th to explain the situation after the promulgation of the emergency financial and economic decrees and to host members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans in Nanjing. Premier Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan attended, and over 600 members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans were present. First, Weng reported on the implementation of the emergency financial and economic decrees, hoping that all members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans would support it. Then, Finance Minister Wang reported on the implementation of the emergency decrees in various places, saying that the general response was very good. Because the Gold Yuan has sufficient preparation and strictly controls its issuance, he believed that it would achieve complete success. After Weng and Wang finished their speeches, Legislative Yuan members Fang Zhichao, Fei Xia, and Supervisory Yuan member Jin Yueguang delivered speeches respectively, expressing their support for the emergency decrees, but raising some opinions. Fang Zhichao said: (1) Currently, there are three kinds of currencies circulating in the market with the issuance of Gold Yuan, and the exchange of gold and US dollars has led to the government issuing a large number of new banknotes, so it is proposed to shorten the period for the use of legal tender to avoid the proliferation of speculative capital. (2) In this method, there are regulations for state-owned and public-owned enterprises and tax rates to be adjusted at the appropriate time, so the cost of goods will inevitably be high, and prices will naturally increase accordingly, but the treatment of workers and public servants and teachers is frozen at "August 19," which is unreasonable, so it is proposed that they should also be adjusted appropriately. Jin Yueguang's opinions are: (1) The government should sell a large amount of materials to absorb speculative capital. (2) The government should exchange gold pounds and rupees in the same way as other foreign currencies. (3) Thoroughly establish a solid credit for the new currency system to promote it smoothly. At the meeting, most people advocated for adjustments to the treatment of public servants and teachers, and the meeting adjourned at the appointed time.</p>
<h3>Hoffman, Stuart, Lehman, and Others Discuss Allocation of Construction Funds, With the ECA's Allocation to China Exceeding 80 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, August 8th] Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Administrator Paul Hoffman met with Ambassador Stuart and Mr. Cleveland on the 8th. Neither Stuart nor Cleveland were willing to reveal the contents of the meeting, but said that Stuart might hold a press conference on the 13th. According to informed sources, the meeting discussed the allocation of the 70 million US dollars construction fund. The 70 million US dollars construction fund must be allocated before the end of the aid to China program at the end of April 1949, and must be used exclusively for construction projects. It is said that Hoffman, Cleveland, and Stuart made a decision on this matter on the 8th, but it will not be announced in the short term. According to the ECA press group, Stuart is still studying the plan.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, August 8th] The ECA announced on the 8th that it had approved the purchase of goods for reconstruction purposes worth nearly 10 million US dollars, of which 8 million US dollars was used to purchase cotton for China. Therefore, the total amount of approved purchases by the ECA for China has reached 83 million US dollars to date.</p>
<p>Other approved purchases were granted to Denmark, France, Norway, Greece, Austria, and the American and British occupation zones in Germany.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Hold Closed-Door Meeting Today</h3>
<p>To Hear Reports from Financial Authorities</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, September 9th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting on the morning of the 10th to hear reports from financial authorities on the implementation of the emergency financial and economic decrees. It is reported that Premier Weng, Finance Minister Wang, and Governor Yu Hongjun have been invited to attend and explain the situation, and to prepare for inquiries from various members, so as to conduct careful review and achieve the task of reform quickly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Factories, Companies, and Businesses Must Report Foreign Exchange by Next Week; Commercial Banks and Firms Can Still Apply to Use Registered Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] Following the reporting and registration of foreign exchange by commercial banks and firms to the Central Bank, the foreign exchange of industrial and commercial enterprises nationwide will also be subject to reporting and registration within a time limit. The foreign exchange owned by factories, companies, and businesses in Shanghai must be reported and registered to the Central Bank within next week. Vice Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan will go to Shanghai again next week to fully supervise the reporting and registration matters. Other parts of the country will gradually report and register within a time limit, and it should be completed within the time limit specified by the emergency financial and economic decrees.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] Before the reporting and registration of foreign exchange by various commercial banks and firms, the foreign exchange and gold and silver of various national banks and bureaus were first submitted to the Central Bank in accordance with government orders, and have now been completed, with a total value of 110 million US dollars. The various commercial banks and firms were ordered to first report and register their foreign exchange, gold, and silver to the Central Bank. As of the afternoon of the 9th, the Ministry of Finance received a long-distance call from Shanghai reporting that more than 300 units had reported and registered to the Central Bank, and although the exact figure of the total amount has not yet been calculated, it is estimated to reach 100 million US dollars. After the reporting and registration of foreign exchange by various commercial banks and firms, after being submitted to the Central Bank, the various banks and firms can still apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval to use them. In addition to being able to be used in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the "Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People" and Article 9 of the "Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by the People," and the "Central Bank's Measures for Payment of Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Deposits," it can also be used to increase the capital of the banks and firms. However, in order to prevent various commercial banks and firms from immediately withdrawing them after submission, the government will carefully review their use, and only allow their use if they have a legitimate purpose.</p>
<h3>Many Legislative Yuan Members Oppose the Establishment of New Agencies by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan's Industry and Commerce Committee Held Closed-Door Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] The Industry and Resources Committee of the Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee held a closed-door meeting at 9:00 AM on the 9th, chaired by Lu Yuwen. Representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the China Textile Construction Corporation were appointed to attend and answer questions. It is understood that the members were quite concerned about the implementation of the abolition of the Cotton Yarn Cloth Management Committee and the Fuel Management Committee. Regarding the report by the representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that it intends to establish a Briquette Coal Adjustment Committee and a Cotton Yarn Cloth Guidance Association, Liu Youchen, Peng Erkang, and others expressed their opposition, believing that the establishment of new agencies is "new wine in old bottles" and fundamentally contradicts the original intention of the Legislative Yuan's general meeting to abolish these agencies. The Executive Yuan should still earnestly comply with the resolution.</p>
<h3>Director Dong Reserved Comments on the Death of Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>Why Does the Soviet Union Provide Convenience to Rebels?</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] When answering a reporter's question at a press conference on the afternoon of the 9th about "What is your opinion on the death of Feng Yuxiang this time?" Dong Xian'guang, Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, said: Although there are still some undisclosed facts about Feng Yuxiang's death, it is noteworthy that Feng died on a Soviet ship on his way to the Soviet Union. Since he had publicly stated that he would return to China to lead a rebellion in order to overthrow the Chinese government, the question immediately arises as to why the Soviet government still provided him with convenience to go to the Soviet Union? Before this point and other facts are clarified, I intend to reserve further comments.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, September 9th Broadcast: Feng Yuxiang's wife is still ill and residing at the Moscow National Hotel. According to her secretary, Mrs. Feng is unable to meet guests due to illness.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, August 8th] The New York Post published an article by former Secretary of the Interior Ickes, saying that Feng Yuxiang hurriedly left the United States on a Soviet ship because he feared that someone would harm him in the United States, but he still encountered an accident.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Rectifies Tax Revenue, Expected to Increase Substantially</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] According to the Ministry of Finance: In the past, local finances were unable to control expenditures due to high prices, especially the monthly adjustment of living subsidies for public servants and teachers, which accounted for more than 70% of the total local expenditures each year.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hirohito's War Responsibility and the Emperor System</h3>
<p>The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal has concluded, without making any decision on the question of whether Emperor Hirohito should bear war responsibility. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 7th, American prosecutors, fearing that most Japanese people would be deeply disturbed and consider it a national humiliation if their emperor were put on trial, made every effort to avoid the court discussing whether the emperor should bear war responsibility. At the same time, during his trial, Hideki Tojo also tried his best to defend the emperor, attempting to absolve him of responsibility. In his testimony, he said: "Declaring war on Britain and the United States was my doing, and has nothing to do with Emperor Hirohito, or any official or civilian. I, Tojo, will take full responsibility for everything." Based on this, it is feared that the emperor's war responsibility will quietly disappear.</p>
<p>However, judging by common sense, anyone with even a slight understanding of Japanese politics knows that the "Emperor System" is a cover for all Japanese aggression forces, and that to achieve true democratization of Japanese politics, it must be abolished. The last National Assembly passed a proposal asking the government to determine the principles of the peace treaty with Japan, which also stated that the "Emperor System" is the core of Japanese militarism and should be abolished. In fact, all the Allied nations advocated abolishing the "Emperor System" at the Potsdam Conference. The Potsdam Declaration stipulated that "the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated." Isn't this clearly referring to the Japanese Emperor System and Emperor Hirohito? However, when the Allied nations demanded that Japan accept the Potsdam Declaration unconditionally, things changed. Japan submitted a revised clause in its reply: "The aforementioned declaration does not include any demand for the Emperor to lose his special authority as a sovereign ruler." To comply with Japan's request, the Allied nations replied: "The fate of the Emperor rests with the Japanese people." Thus, the question of whether to abolish the "Emperor System" was temporarily put on hold.</p>
<p>The United States government and public have always had different views on this issue. Joseph Grew, former US Ambassador to Japan, suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on December 22, 1944, that the "Emperor System" should be maintained. He said: "Japan's 'Emperor System' is the only political factor that maintains 'stability.'" The Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo, based on the same reasoning, and believing that the Emperor would be the only medium through which the Allies could control the Japanese people, not only feared that putting Emperor Hirohito on trial would provoke a strong reaction from the Japanese people, but also spared no effort to cover up and justify his war responsibility. Allied General Headquarters advisor George Atcheson said: "We must face reality, the Japanese people still worship the Emperor." Later, when the Allied Headquarters guided the Japanese in drafting a democratic constitution, although all the Emperor's political rights were stripped away and national sovereignty belonged to all the people, the "Emperor System" was still retained, and the Emperor was only changed to a "symbol of the state."</p>
<p>In our honest opinion, if the Japanese people can sincerely and genuinely adopt a British-style constitutional monarchy and turn the Emperor into a British-style emperor, merely regarded as a "symbol of the state" with no power to act, then this matter should be a question for future Japanese constitution-making. I remember that at the Cairo Conference on December 1, 1943, our leader President Chiang Kai-shek also issued a statement on the Emperor issue: "If the Japanese people rise up and launch a revolution, punish their warmongers, and overthrow the government controlled by the warlords, then the countries participating in the Cairo Conference will respect the wishes of the Japanese people themselves and allow them to freely choose the form of their government." This speech was fully agreed upon by President Roosevelt at the time. Now, the United States and China can only abide by this promise on this issue.</p>
<p>Therefore, the question of whether to retain or abolish the Emperor System can be decided by the Japanese people freely and of their own will. However, we must point out that Emperor Hirohito's war responsibility should not be confused with this issue. The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal's avoidance of discussing the Emperor's war responsibility is undoubtedly a major mistake. Emperor Hirohito is the "No. 1 war criminal," and must bear full responsibility for both the war of aggression against China and the war against the United States. He should not be allowed to shirk responsibility or quibble. During the war, American newspapers all referred to Hirohito as the "No. 1 war criminal," which is excellent ironclad proof. Recently, a public opinion poll conducted by the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun showed that many Japanese people advocate Hirohito's abdication. Their intention is to preserve the Emperor System and avoid being burdened by the issue of war responsibility. The Japanese people themselves admit that Hirohito should bear war responsibility, which is strong proof of this. Because even if Japan retains the Emperor System, it does not necessarily have to retain Hirohito's throne, who should be held responsible for the war.</p>
<p>In short, the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal's avoidance of discussing the war responsibility of Emperor Hirohito is a major dereliction of duty due to excessive accommodation to reality, and it has completely lost the meaning of severely punishing war criminals. We should stand on the side of justice and draw the attention of the US government and the Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo to this.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Third Anniversary of Japan's Surrender, He Yingqin Broadcasts Sorrowfully: The Current Suppression of Communists is a Continuation of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Defense Minister He Yingqin held a tea party at 5:30 PM today to commemorate the day, September 9, 1945, when he represented the Supreme Commander in Nanjing to accept the unconditional surrender of the Japanese army in the China war zone. He invited senior staff members of the Army General Headquarters at that time and journalists who participated in the surrender ceremony. At 8 PM, he was invited by the Central Broadcasting Station and the military broadcasting stations of Guangdong and Guangxi to deliver a speech to compatriots across the country. In his speech, He first stated the historical significance of this day of accepting the surrender and recalled his pleasant mood at that time, believing that China could be revived after eight years of arduous resistance and that world peace could be permanently established. Who knew that although foreign invaders have been eliminated in the past three years, communist bandits have risen again. He said in a sorrowful tone: "Because of the full-scale rebellion of the communists, national construction has been hindered and the great cause of revival cannot be unfolded. We cannot help but feel infinitely sad and infinitely distressed today as we commemorate this historically significant day!" He also said: The purpose of the eight-year arduous war of resistance was to achieve national equality, and the current campaign to quell the rebellion is also for the freedom and equality of the nation. He said: "In order to ensure the integrity of national territory and the unity of government orders, the current suppression of communists is essentially a continuation of the eight-year war of resistance."</p>
<p>Awakening Compatriots to Suppress the Rebellion with All Their Strength</p>
<p>He also stated that the government had repeatedly tolerated the communists at first, hoping that they would repent, because the country had undergone eight years of war of resistance, and material resources were scarce and people's livelihoods were extremely difficult. However, the communists betrayed their ancestors and acted perversely, expanding the rebellion instead. The government was forced to issue a decree to suppress the rebellion. At this point, he called on compatriots to use all their manpower and material resources to support the suppression of the rebellion. He said: I am deeply aware that for the past eleven years, from the War of Resistance to the suppression of the rebellion, compatriots across the country have made their utmost efforts to shoulder the burden of manpower and material resources. However, the current work of suppressing the rebellion has not yet been completed, and we must further intensify our efforts to shorten the period of suppressing the rebellion and start national construction as soon as possible. We know that the communists are not bound by laws and regulations and do not care about the suffering of the people. They can use all kinds of high-handed and brutal means to concentrate and control all the manpower and material resources in the controlled areas to engage in rebellion. Therefore, the current scale of military suppression of communists is exceptionally large, and the consumption of combat is even greater than during the War of Resistance. The officers and soldiers at the front endure all material difficulties and fight bloody battles to prevent the spread of the Red disaster. Compatriots in the rear should not sit idly by, but should take out all the manpower and material resources to support the suppression of the rebellion. Modern warfare is total war, not just a simple military war. Especially in the suppression of communists, compatriots across the country must work together in their respective positions, so that the communist disaster can be quelled as soon as possible and social order can be restored. On this day of commemorating the surrender, we can recall how we united as a nation to defeat a powerful enemy. At the same time, we should especially encourage each other on how to work together to ensure the fruits of our victory in the future. I believe that compatriots across the country will be of one mind and support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion under the overall goal of giving priority to suppressing the rebellion, contributing their wealth and strength to the best of their ability, and using the belief and determination that the War of Resistance will be victorious to guarantee that the suppression of the rebellion will be victorious and the country will be built successfully. I dare say that the violent Japanese warlords could not achieve their attempt to destroy our country, and no traitor can ever hope to overthrow our government and destroy our country.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Past and Looking Forward to the Future with a Myriad of Emotions</h3>
<p>He concluded: "Three years have passed since the surrender. In terms of the domestic situation, the communists are harassing us, and all construction has not made significant progress. In terms of the world situation, the Cold War between the two major blocs has not ended, and the United Nations organization cannot completely resolve various international problems. Remembering the bright future of our country and the world at the time of surrender, we cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions. However, we must strive for the freedom and equality of the nation at all costs. We must strive to promote the stability of the world regardless of all difficulties. I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will work together, strive together, and be loyal to the country in their respective positions, seeking construction in the midst of the rebellion, seeking stability in the midst of turmoil, quickly suppressing the communist disaster, reviving the country, and further promoting the permanent peace of the world together with all democratic countries."</p>

<h3>Two Lakes Supervisory Office Holds Tea Party: Elder Statesmen of Hubei Offer Candid Opinions; Insist on Strict Handling of Mao Jiaqi and Thorough Investigation of Wang Dongyuan's Accounting</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] The Two Lakes Supervisory Committee Office today held its first tea party, inviting incumbent supervisory committee members in Hubei and elder statesmen of Hubei Province. During the event, they conducted a two-hour review of two issues: punishing corruption and reforming the economy. Speakers included Zhang Nanxian, Li Shucheng, Hu Zhongmin, Ai Tongying, and over ten others, all of whom were impassioned and moved to tears. The summarized opinions from all parties are as follows: (1) To exercise supervisory power effectively, corruption must be thoroughly exposed. To severely punish corruption, the corruption and dereliction of duty by judicial officials must be addressed first; otherwise, corrupt officials cannot be brought to justice, and investigations are futile. Therefore, the case of Prosecutor Mao Jiaqi's acceptance of bribes should be prioritized as the first target of the Supervisory Committee Office. (2) To swat flies, one must first swat tigers; to swat tigers, one must first disregard personal relationships. While it is necessary to investigate the uncleared accounts of the fifty-plus county magistrates in Hubei, the uncleared accounts of the provincial chairman should be investigated first. Cases such as Wang Dongyuan benefiting himself by giving away received materials must be thoroughly investigated.</p>

<h3>Berlin City Council Harassment Incident: Soviets Reject US and French Protests; Soviet Air Force Holds Large-Scale Exercise in Air Corridors</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 9th] Soviet authorities today rejected the Western powers' accusations that the Soviets surrounded the Berlin City Hall, drove the City Council into the Western sector, broke into the military liaison office, and arrested 40 West Berlin police officers, causing two days of terror. As the Soviets refused to consider the Western powers' military commanders' protests, Soviet fighter jets were conducting exercises over Berlin, making crossing flights in the Western powers' air corridors. Soviet Berlin Commander Major General Kotikov rejected the US protest, deeming it baseless. The US note was personally delivered to Kotikov by US Berlin Commander Colonel Howley, who protested the Soviet troops and East German police's intrusion into the US liaison office within the Berlin City Hall on the evening of the 6th, arresting 20 West Berlin police officers, and the Communist Party members' humiliation of British and American journalists present. The French note was delivered by French Commander-in-Chief in Germany Koenig to Soviet Deputy Commander-in-Chief Major General Khvatkov. The note protested the Soviet military's violation of the Yekelovsnikov agreement's promise of safe passage, arresting 19 West Berlin police officers withdrawing from Berlin City Hall to the French sector, but this was also sternly rejected by Khvatkov. He coldly responded to the French request to release the arrested German police officers, stating that the matter was entirely a German affair and unrelated to the Soviets. The Soviet rejection of the above two notes was announced by the Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur, which is registered with the Soviet authorities. This new incident in the Berlin "Cold War" is occurring simultaneously with the breakdown of the Four-Power military commanders' Berlin talks, which have been indefinitely postponed due to the failure to resolve the currency issue. A well-informed source stated: The Soviet Union demands that the entire city of Berlin accept the Soviet East German mark, and that all financial matters be managed by an advisory committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 9th] After notifying the Four-Power Air Navigation Safety Center that it would conduct exercises with more aircraft in the Western air corridors for seven days, saturating the corridors, the Soviet fighter jet squadrons roared over the US-occupied zone of Berlin at noon today. The Soviet Union is using exercises as a pretext to threaten the Berlin airlift, which is generally regarded as part of the Soviet plan to seize the entire city. At least ten Soviet aircraft flew over Berlin at noon, which US authorities estimate were at an altitude of over 10,000 feet. They also stated that if the Soviet Union maintains this altitude, the exercises comply with the Four-Power regulations and are beyond reproach. US officials at the airlift starting point of Wiesbaden stated that the Soviet attempt to disrupt the US airlift with exercises is doomed to failure. "The air corridors are quite wide, so accidents are difficult to occur, unless the Soviet Union intentionally collides, but it would also risk crashing."</p>
<h3>Truman Supports Marshall's Policy: Determined to Uphold Rights in Berlin; States Will Not Negotiate Under Pressure</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington, 9th Broadcast: President Truman today endorsed Marshall's announcement of a tough policy to resist the Communist actions in Berlin at a press conference. Reporters raised many questions, but Truman refused to answer. He said that while continuing to strive to resolve the US-Soviet dispute, the United States must uphold its rights in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference yesterday that the Berlin City Hall incident should be blamed on "German and foreign" Communist elements, whose aim is clearly to subvert democratic institutions, and we must resolutely resist them. However, Marshall refused to answer whether the United States will take retaliatory measures of an electrical nature. He stated that the four-power military commanders are currently studying the report of the Transportation and Currency Committee and hope that the commanders' meeting can continue and that the municipal incident will not affect the Moscow talks. Marshall reiterated that US policy is to not negotiate under pressure.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] Diplomats here believe that the riots in Berlin, instigated by the Soviets, have made the tense situation more critical, and any accident could occur as a result. It is believed here that the Berlin unrest indicates that the Kremlin, regardless of the talks in Moscow and the Berlin blockade, is still determined to drive the Western powers out of Berlin. Experts in foreign affairs here do not claim to understand the Soviet Union's motivation for suddenly acting perversely in that area, especially when the four-power military governors' meeting has reached a concrete stage. However, they list the following possibilities: (1) The Soviet omnipotent Politburo may believe that negotiations to lift the blockade and implement a single currency are greatly disadvantageous to the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union may be using the political turmoil in France to buy time to gain favorable terms. People with experience in diplomacy with the Soviet Union have pointed out a third possibility, that the unrest is merely a smokescreen for the Soviet Union to suddenly lift the blockade, but this is only one possibility, and no one is hopeful about it. What diplomats here unanimously agree on is that the Berlin material industry is already fraught with crises.</p>
<h3>100,000 Berlin Citizens Hold Large Anti-Communist Demonstration</h3>

<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 9th Broadcast, Los Angeles News: Franklin D.

<h3>Four Powers Discuss Italian Colonial Issues: Soviets Suggest Meeting Today; US Expresses Dissent Due to Time Constraints; Preliminary Meeting May Be Held by Deputy Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 9th Broadcast, Paris News: The French Foreign Ministry announced that France has accepted the Soviet proposal to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting and has invited the three countries' foreign ministers to meet in Paris, but the date has not been determined. However, according to Moscow Radio, the Soviet Union suggested that the meeting begin on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington, 9th Broadcast: The State Department today informally rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on the 10th to discuss the disposition of the pre-war Italian colonies, considering the "time too pressing."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] The British Foreign Office announced today that the British government has received a Soviet note suggesting a four-power foreign ministers' meeting be convened in Paris on the 10th to discuss the Italian colonial issue. According to well-informed sources, Bevin, who is preparing some suggestions before the UN General Assembly convenes, is expected to go to Paris tomorrow. It is also heard that he will suggest a preliminary meeting, attended not by ambassadors from the four countries, but by deputy foreign ministers from the four countries. It is said that British Deputy Foreign Minister Mayhew will attend the preliminary meeting in place of Bevin, while the Soviet representative may be Malik, the head of the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p>Divergent Opinions Between the UK, US, and Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] According to authoritative sources: The issue of the former Italian colonies should be decided by the UN General Assembly to be convened in Paris on September 21. The opinions of the UK and the US are generally consistent, namely: (1) Temporarily maintain the status quo of Libya to maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean and prevent the infiltration of communism. (2) Return Eritrea to Italy, but allocate a corridor to Abyssinia to access the sea. (3) Return Somaliland to Italy. (4) Tripoli and Cyrenaica will temporarily remain under British military rule, as both the UK and the US believe it is necessary to retain naval and air bases there. The Soviet Union, however, advocates returning all former Italian colonies to Italy. One of the reasons the UK and the US disagree is that Italy's financial situation is unable to develop all of these lands. Therefore, observers here believe that due to the above differences, the four foreign ministers cannot resolve the Italian colonial issue, and this issue must be resolved at the current or next UN General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Selling Eyeballs at Reduced Prices: Hoping to Buy a Farm</h3>
<p>Three American Youths Have Far-Fetched Ideas</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] Three American youths, due to empty pockets, have placed advertisements, willing to sell one eye each for US$5,000, but the surgical costs must be borne by the purchaser. It is understood that recently, a father of seven living in Rhode Island sold one of his eyes to a blind person, obtained $10,000, and was able to buy a farm. Now the three youths are selling at reduced prices, hoping to easily find buyers.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Split: All Dissatisfied with Churchill</h3>
<p>Eden to Gain Leadership of the Party</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] Churchill's leadership within the British Conservative Party, and his entire political career, are now being threatened by internal Conservative dissent. It has previously been rumored that a political disagreement occurred between Churchill and former Foreign Secretary Eden. Now, not only are there serious differences of opinion between the two, but the Conservative Party has also split into two factions. The dissenters are mostly young Conservative Party members. They believe that the wartime prime minister's leadership career has come to an end. They believe that Churchill is a traitor to the Conservative Party, as Churchill is not subject to the Conservative Party's command. They further believe that Churchill no longer has contact with the voters, and even if the Conservative Party wins the next election, Churchill is not a suitable candidate for prime minister. A well-informed political authority told this agency: "Many Conservative Party members now believe that Eden is the leader of the party and can replace Churchill as prime minister in a Conservative government. This is undoubtedly the case."</p>

The broadcast launched a fierce attack on the United States and the government led by Syngman Rhee, and declared that the "Central Government" to be established is a legitimate organization, and this government will unite the Koreans in the Soviet occupation zone to launch an unprecedentedly fierce struggle in order to achieve the unification and independence of the country.

<h3>Uncover Unprecedented Large-Scale Currency Speculation Case: Two Well-Known Foreigners Detained; Confess to Having US$170,000 Deposited in New York</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau yesterday uncovered an unprecedentedly large organization of foreigners engaged in private currency speculation. The protagonist is an Italian, Pilara, and involves Benaoviez, a British national and well-known tennis player who was formerly a broker at the Shanghai Public Exchange. In addition, it has been discovered that several large Chinese commercial firms are also involved in this case. After days of interrogation, clues have been obtained.</p>
<p>The Italian Pilara is the person in charge of the Shanghai office of the large Italian company Lovisco, with the office located in Room 101 of the Cathay Hotel and residing at 197 Lincoln Avenue. He usually engages in large-scale currency speculation. On the 3rd of this month, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau, acting on a tip, conducted an investigation and found US$5,000 in cash in his office. Suspecting him of buying and selling black market US dollars, he was taken in for questioning. Under strict interrogation, he revealed the truth. According to him, a large amount of US dollars was successively deposited in Chase Bank in New York, transferred to him by the Italian headquarters. The first deposit was US$104,440 on July 23. The second deposit on July 28 was for two amounts, one for US$37,042.48 and one for US$27,880. The third deposit was on July 31, with one deposit of US$5,405. The total amount was US$174,817.48. After depositing the money, he obtained a Chase Bank checkbook for use. He finally confessed that the person who had dealings with him today was a British national, Benaoviez. After the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau inspected his checkbook, there were a total of 25 checks. He had signed out six checks in his own name, but the Chase Bank records in New York showed that he had signed out as many as 15 checks.</p>
<h3>Involves Several Well-Known Chinese Commercial Firms</h3>
<p>Subsequently, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau summoned Benaoviez for questioning. He admitted that in 1946, he did purchase a US$2,000 draft from Pilara for US$2,000 in cash, which was used to pay the coffee account of the American company Aenausend Clayden. Afterwards, he purchased another US$3,150 draft. Upon concluding that the facts were clear, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau temporarily detained Benaoviez. At the same time, as the case involves several well-known Chinese commercial firms, and further investigation is required, an application has been made to the Special Criminal Court to extend the detention for seven days.</p>

It is reported that the police received information that Cai Cixian and Xu Xingde, rice merchants at No. 656 Fanhangdu Road, were hoarding rice and engaging in corrupt practices in the distribution of household rice. In addition, Zhang Ziwen, a resident of No. 660 on the same road, was hoarding a large quantity of cooking oil. After sending personnel to investigate and confirm the facts, the three were arrested and sent to the District Court Prosecutor's Office at 4:30 p.m. yesterday for interrogation according to law. Subsequently, the office interrogated Cai and others, and due to the seriousness of the charges, they were immediately detained.</p>
<h3>Price Limit on Rice Approved by the City Government</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The "August 19th" price limit on rice in this city, which was previously discussed and approved by the Social Affairs Bureau and rice merchants, has been approved by the city government. The maximum retail prices per stone are as follows: Special Japonica rice: 23.5 Gold Yuan; Grade 1 White Japonica rice: 22.5 Gold Yuan; Grade 2: 22 Gold Yuan; Grade 3: 20.5 Gold Yuan; Bo-dao rice: 23 Gold Yuan; Early rice: 22 Gold Yuan; Foreign Xian rice: 22.5 Gold Yuan; Port Xian rice: 20.5 Gold Yuan; Machine Xian rice: 19.5 Gold Yuan; Sub Xian rice: 18 Gold Yuan; Bai Yuan rice: 22.6 Gold Yuan.

According to the Social Affairs Bureau, rice prices in the market have fallen after "August 19th." The "August 19th" price limit is not intended to raise the already lowered rice prices to the regulated amount, but is only a maximum standard that should not be exceeded.</p>
<h3>Rong Hongyuan Case: Two People Implicated and Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Rong Hongyuan suspected foreign exchange speculation case has developed after investigation by the Special Criminal Court prosecutor, and the scope is quite extensive. The Special Criminal Court yesterday began dispatching personnel to cooperate with the Gold Control Bureau and the Municipal Police Department to arrest individuals involved in the case. It is reported that those arrested include Gong Chongrui, manager of the Shanghai office of Fu Yuanxiang in Qingdao, located at No. 293 Hankou Road, and Lin Changchun, the temporary person in charge of the Shanghai branch of Xin Jia Ban Guanghua Company in Room 61, No. 25 Jinling East Road.

According to Lin Changchun, the manager is Lin Guoren, a native of Fujian, who left Shanghai for Singapore a week ago. He and another person named Lin Huanqiong served as temporary persons in charge. The handling personnel, together with the local Bao Zhang (neighborhood head) Tian Zhang, affixed seals to the confiscated items and transported them to the Special Criminal Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Depletion of Western Medicine Supply: Association Requests Assistance</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Western Medicine Trade Association reported that due to the reduction in import quotas for medicines, important medicines such as penicillin and streptomycin are nearly depleted, making supply difficult.

<h3>A Letter Reveals Secrets: Hu Guoliang and Dai Jiaju Confess to Foreign Exchange Speculation, Amounting to Over 500,000 Gold Yuan. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Releases Details of the Case.</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the arrest of Hu Guoliang and Dai Jiaju for foreign exchange speculation, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters released the details of the case yesterday, stating: On the 7th of this month, based on confidential reports, the headquarters learned that the China Trust Company in this city was still engaged in large-scale illegal foreign exchange speculation after the currency reform. It secretly dispatched personnel to cooperate with the Gold Control Bureau to the China Trust Company at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, arresting its deputy manager, Dai Jiaju, and Hu Guoliang, manager of Datong Yarn Factory, who was implicated by Dai's confession. A letter addressed to Dai by Liang Rongchun was seized on the spot, detailing the exchange figures, totaling 702.4 billion Legal Tender, equivalent to 234,132 Gold Yuan. They were brought to the headquarters and interrogated overnight. According to Dai Jiaju's written record and confession: On September 3rd, he received a letter brought by someone from Hong Kong entrusted by Liang Rongchun (manager of China Trust Company), instructing him to pay 240,000 Gold Yuan according to the attached address. The funds were obtained from Hu Guoliang in the form of 135 gold bars, which were exchanged for Gold Yuan at the Central Bank before being paid out. On September 4th, he received another notification from Liang, instructing him to pay over 300,000 Gold Yuan according to the address provided. The funds were obtained from Hu Guoliang in two installments, totaling 84,000 US dollars, which were then exchanged for Gold Yuan at the Central Bank before being paid out. According to Hu Guoliang's written record and confession: He admitted to paying Dai Jiaju a total of 135 large gold bars and 84,000 US dollars in two installments, which were exchanged for Gold Yuan at the Central Bank and then transferred to Hong Kong. The payable figures in the seized letter were not included in this. Combining the above staggering figures and the detailed records in the seized letter of Gold Yuan being exchanged for Hong Kong dollars and gold being purchased, it proves that Hu Guoliang and others sold a large amount of gold and US dollars and then purchased them from Hong Kong, illegally profiting from it. The circumstances are very clear. This case is not only the most planned and massive foreign exchange speculation group uncovered after the Emergency Economic Measures, but also proves that it was a large-scale organization engaged in the black market of gold and currency in the past. The authorities attach great importance to this matter. In addition to the fact that Hu and Dai were transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation the day before yesterday (the 8th), Liang Rongchun, the manager of China Trust Company who remains in Hong Kong, is also being pursued.</p>
<h3>22 Recipient Accounts Under Investigation</h3>
<p>In addition, according to the seized letter, 22 recipient accounts were involved. The Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters summoned them for questioning on the 9th.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] All sectors of this city launched a costume parade yesterday afternoon, initiated by the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, to support the government's implementation of currency reform, eliminate communist plots, and practice thrift.

Four people were dressed as traitorous merchants hoarding goods, covered in money and goods, and two students dressed as communist spies. The three traitorous merchants sat on three coffins, one of which had a hand extending out, filled with gold and US dollars. Another person sat on a rickshaw, with a wooden sign reading "Execution of a Traitorous Merchant" inserted behind them, and they paraded through the city while beating gongs and drums. The procession started from Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road, passed through Carter Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, the Bund, East Zhongzheng Road, and Linsen Road, and dispersed at Fuxing Park. Citizens lined the streets to watch, and traffic was slightly affected.</p>

<h3>Requesting Alcohol Before Execution: Still Deluding Himself About Sino-Japanese Friendship</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Itaru Junnosuke (also known as Zhang Zongyuan), a Japanese war criminal who once served as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin, was executed by firing squad by the military court at Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison yesterday. Itaru Junnosuke was a long-time ambitious Japanese conspirator. He came to China in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, falsely claiming naturalization and changing his name to Zhang Zongyuan. He initially served as a major general advisor to Zhang Zuolin of the Northeast Army. After the September 18th Incident, he secretly went to Andong, colluded with local scoundrels, and instigated puppet organizations. He also wrote books such as "The Situation in China," "A General View of Policies Toward China," and "A General Outline of Emergency Handling of China," all of which were strategies aimed at destroying our country. In April of the twenty-first year, he became the deputy commander of the Anfeng area, allowing Japanese military police and his troops to capture and kill Chinese Catholic personnel and civilians in Badagou, Andong. After the July 7th Incident, he infiltrated Tianjin and, with the suggestion of the enemy chieftain General Terauchi, he recruited bandit troops such as Liu Peichen and forcibly conscripted militiamen to organize the pseudo Shandong Autonomous Allied Army, claiming to be the general commander of the army. He fought against the National Army in Daowei Town, Rizhao, and other places, implementing his conspiracy to control China with Chinese people. After the victory, he was detained by the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters and sentenced to death by the military court presided over by Judge Shi Meiyu. Yesterday, President Ning cabled to approve the execution. At 11:00 am, the court's prosecutor Shi Shishi, secretary Guo Zhenhuan, interpreter Wang Renming, and a squad of military police went to Shanghai Prison to set up the case, brought out the prisoner, and informed him that they were ordered to carry out the execution. The prisoner's hair was already gray. He was wearing a grass-green military uniform and tortoiseshell glasses. He was calm and asked to write three wills, and also smoked paper cigarettes. One of his wills was to his family, one was to Colonel Tanaka, and one was to Lieutenant General Ishiwara, still boasting about "Sino-Japanese friendship" and other words. After writing, he asked for alcohol, requested not to be handcuffed, and entrusted his tortoiseshell glasses and a fountain pen to Major General Sakuradaira. He was then escorted to the execution ground and killed with one shot.</p>

<h3>The Seventh General Assembly of the Councilors Opens; Speaker Expresses a Multitude of Emotions in Opening Address; First Meeting Immediately Follows to Hear the Mayor's Report</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The seventh session of the first Municipal Council convened grandly yesterday morning at its auditorium on Tanggu Road. After Speaker Pan led the ceremonial proceedings, he delivered the opening address. Subsequently, Mayor Wu gave a speech, followed by a response from Zhao Yangxiong. The ceremony concluded at eleven o'clock. Following a ten-minute recess, the first meeting commenced, during which Mayor Wu presented a policy report and answered questions from the councilors, adjourning at noon.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Speaker Pan's address: Today, as we hold the seventh general assembly, a brief reflection on the past two years and a review of the past twenty days will undoubtedly evoke various feelings. I would like to share my personal sentiments and hope to encourage my colleagues to strive to genuinely represent public opinion. The term of the Municipal Councilors has expired and should have been renewed. However, due to the promulgation of the Constitution and the pending revision of local autonomy regulations, the councilors' terms have been extended until the establishment of a Municipal Council elected in accordance with the Constitution. Therefore, we are holding the seventh general assembly today. Given this, we hope that the Legislative Yuan, currently in session, can expedite the completion of the general rules regarding local autonomy, particularly those concerning municipalities directly under the central government, so that our city can establish a municipal autonomy system in accordance with these rules after our nation implements constitutional governance. Secondly, how can a representative body truly represent public opinion? This is a question that deserves our deep consideration. Entrusted by the citizens who elected us, we must, on the one hand, strive for the minimum necessary municipal construction and, on the other hand, consider the maximum acceptable burden on the citizens. Navigating this difficult path to fulfill our mission is not easy. I believe that councilors should be open-minded, seek broad consultation, and welcome responsible reports and suggestions from any citizen as a reference for discussing issues. When necessary, we can consult with newspapers to conduct public opinion polls on specific difficult problems, ensuring that the decisions made by the council during the discussion of proposals align with the genuine majority opinion of the public.</p>
<p>Prioritizing Shanghai While Considering Property Prices Across Regions: Thirdly, the economic situation in our city over the past twenty days has seen a generally stable price level, thanks to the vigorous enforcement of price controls by the economic supervisors Yu and Jiang, as well as the municipal authorities. In all fairness, Shanghai has performed the best in the country during these twenty days. I sincerely hope that the central government, while prioritizing Shanghai, can also pay closer attention to the prices in major cities in South China, North China, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and strive to coordinate producer prices with distribution prices, and adjust production costs with retail prices, so that the Shanghai market can have a reasonable track to follow, and will not be affected by the collapse of other regions' defenses in the future, and will not lead to the shrinkage of production due to the stagnation of goods exchange.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the municipal government faced revenue shortfalls during the price fluctuations, and had to seek subsidies from the central government in July and August. The municipal public utilities also had to borrow money from the municipal government in August to cover their deficits due to the reduction of new prices. All of these issues should be adjusted and remedied after the currency reform. The municipal government is preparing to adjust tax revenues and revising its revenue and expenditure budget for September to December of this year in accordance with the new currency system, which will be submitted to this general assembly for our serious discussion.</p>
<p>Seeking the Truth of Facts to Obtain Fair Judgments</p>
<p>Finally, I have one additional point to make: the difference between the whole and the part is a basic understanding that should be had when discussing any event. For example, the term "corruption" cannot be applied to all officials. I dare not say that there is not a single corrupt official in Shanghai, but I dare say that there are many judicial officials, administrative officials, and military and police chiefs in Shanghai who endure hardship, maintain their integrity, and abide by the law, and should be respected and commended by the people. I dare not say that there are no government offices in Shanghai that deliberately delay public affairs, but I dare say that Shanghai does have highly efficient judicial and administrative organs that are deeply valued by foreign friends, but unfortunately have not received the attention of the citizens. Similarly, the term "奸商" (tricky merchant) cannot be applied to all merchants. Shanghai does have some lawless and self-seeking treacherous merchants, but most of the merchants in Shanghai still abide by the rules and seek profits through legitimate means. Therefore, I sincerely hope that my colleagues in this council will not pick up on one or two examples when discussing any case to generalize, so that we can seek the truth of the facts and obtain a fair judgment.</p>
<p>Mayor Urges Cooperation and Promotion of the Doctrine of the Mean</p>
<p>Excerpts from Mayor Wu's address: It has been two years since the first general assembly of the Council. The Speaker asked the Councilors to ask themselves what contributions they have made. Inspired by the Speaker, I reflected on my work over the past two years and felt deeply ashamed. Recalling that the City Government's efforts in the past two years have been deteriorating, just like the tightening of the war situation, but the various tasks can still be promoted as scheduled, relying on the close cooperation of the military and political parties, the unity and mutual assistance of the government and the council, and the full promotion of the spirit of the doctrine of the mean. Confucius said: "Cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world." The way to govern the state must also be inseparable from the doctrine of the mean. In today's epoch-making era, if we want to progress, all parties must cooperate loyally and seek the doctrine of the mean, then the difficulties can be safely overcome.</p>
<p>Policy Report</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony was completed, the first general assembly was held immediately. First, Mayor Wu gave a policy report, which lasted for forty-five minutes. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Civil Affairs</p>
<p>The organizational and implementation methods for the People's Self-Defense Force have been drafted, and the Self-Defense Training Committee is also ready. However, the key issue is how to coordinate with the volunteer police, and the source of funding is a difficulty.</p>
<p>Police Affairs</p>
<p>The problem of establishing a garrison brigade requires more than 160 trillion yuan before the central government promulgates new economic measures. After the currency reform, the budget requires more than 10 million gold yuan. The municipal government will convene relevant agencies to discuss and then submit to the meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Social Affairs</p>
<p>To date, there are still more than ten work-relief centers continuing to operate public relief. As for the construction of the second phase of charity sale houses, it cannot be continued due to the sharp rise in various materials and the inability to budget. Regarding household rice distribution, restricted by the Sino-US agreement, the price can only be lower than the market price by 5%. In order to take care of the burden on citizens, it is divided into three types: ordinary rice distribution, poor people's rice distribution, and碎米 (broken rice), so as to reduce the burden on citizens.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>A. The number of schools and classes in this city from September to December of the 34th year (1945) was 18 middle schools with 175 classes and 86 national schools with 743 classes. In September of this year, middle schools have increased to 30 schools with 380 classes, and national schools have increased to 270 schools with 2,562 classes. B. Education expenses accounted for 8.28% of the total budget in the first half of the 35th year (1946), and 20% of the budget in the first half of the 37th year (1948), and the actual expenditure has been 22.57%.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>In the former concession era of this city, the total annual income of the three institutions, the Municipal Government, the Public Concession Bureau, and the French Concession Bureau, was 46 million yuan, of which rent alone reached 15 million yuan. Now, the annual tax revenue of the municipal government cannot reach 92 million gold yuan. Reorganizing tax revenue is the top priority.</p>
<p>Public Works</p>
<p>The prices of various engineering materials have risen sharply. The expenditure of the Public Works Bureau for the four months from September to December this year is 700,000 gold yuan. Calculated in this way, the annual amount should be 2.1 million gold yuan.</p>
<p>Public Utilities</p>
<p>The municipal government, the council, and relevant units have jointly organized a public utilities open investigation and review committee. If you think it is necessary to inquire about public utilities, you can review them as much as possible. After the currency reform, the central government has carefully discussed the prices of public utilities in various parts of the country, and there will be an explicit announcement.</p>
<p>Land Administration</p>
<p>Regarding land consolidation, more than 90% of the city center area has been completed. Therefore, land value tax will be one of the important items in the city's tax revenue in the future. However, it can only be effective if prices are stable.</p>
<p>Health</p>
<p>Health expenses are very tight. The epidemic prevention work relies on US aid to continue. Fortunately, cholera did not occur in the city this summer.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's conclusion made two points: (1) The municipal government should strive to cooperate with the new economic plan formulated by the central government to stabilize prices. (2) Under the principle of vigorously practicing economy, we should strive for a balanced budget.</p>
<h3>Four Councilors Inquire; Mayor Answers One by One</h3>
<p>The inquiry began at 11:30. Mayor Wu answered one by one as follows: Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Zhang Zhihan, he replied: (1) Regarding the matter of reducing cars, the municipal government should set an example, and my opinion is completely consistent, and it will be thoroughly implemented. (2) Regarding the matter of depositing public funds in the municipal treasury, the municipal government ordered its subordinates to comply with it last month. Anyone who should pay but does not will be punished with the crime of corruption. Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, he replied: (1) It is actually difficult to recover the racetrack, and there is no money to purchase it. It was previously proposed to exchange it with the Jiangwan racetrack, but it was not approved by the central government, and land is currently being sought for exchange. (2) Regarding the construction of the art museum, the owner, Hardoon, has handed over the land deed to the Land Administration Bureau, and it is currently being designed and sampled. Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Fei Shusheng, he replied: (1) The central government's unified case on public utility prices is because all localities have the same difficulties, so it should be resolved by the central government in a unified manner, and the local government can only obey the central government's orders. (2) Regarding the issue of subsidies after the price reduction of public utilities, a public investigation and review committee on prices has now been established. If there are any opinions on the increase or decrease in the income and expenditure of various companies, you can submit them to the meeting for public discussion and resolution. (3) Regarding the economic emergency measures promulgated by the central government, the municipal government will do its best to cooperate and implement them. No matter how big or small the stores are, those who are found to have raised prices will be strictly dealt with. I hope citizens will report them. Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Fan Xipin, the mayor showed Deng Zhonghe a letter and photo of Wan Lilang when soliciting special donations. Is it appropriate to solicit donations in this way? The mayor replied: Showing photos in the Deng case was because Deng had been solicited many times, but he only agreed to donate 30 billion, which was far from the purpose of the solicitation committee. At that time, Zhu Zhengwen had a letter to the municipal government, reporting that he had already reported to the District Prosecutor's Office, and attached a letter and photo. I think that since he is suspected of being a traitor, it is in line with the central government's special donation rules, which stipulate that those who make a fortune from national disasters are the main targets of solicitation. Therefore, I showed him the photo, hoping that he could automatically donate money. As for the charge of being a traitor, I know that he has been accused, and the municipal government does not need to overstep its authority. In response to Councilor Fan's inquiry, the mayor should show courage, and in the past, he always practiced Taijiquan, and in the future, he should practice Shaolinquan. The mayor's reply was simple and straightforward: "I don't have enough talent and strength, and I really want to learn." After answering, he returned to his seat, and the speaker announced the adjournment of the first general assembly.</p>

<h3>"Restoration King" Ultimately Becomes a Prisoner; Ignorant Imperial Thought Urgently Needs to be Eradicated; The Lanzhou Security Authorities Strictly Investigate</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Binglin</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 6th (Airmail)] On the 4th of this month, the Lanzhou Higher Special Criminal Court announced a special case that has never been made public. From this incident, it can be seen that the rural areas of the Northwest today are still stagnant in the ignorant and ignorant "era of theocracy," and many people's minds still harbor "imperial thoughts."</p>
<p>Descendant of the Deceased Qing Dynasty Deceived by Bandits</p>
<p>Last spring, in Linxia County, Gansu Province, there was a 23-year-old young farmer named Ma Yunlin. He was a descendant of the deceased Qing Dynasty (originally named Aisin Gioro Pu Cun). Under the instigation of the treacherous bandit Sang Wenbing and the local Taoist Chen Guhan, they agreed to establish themselves as the "Great Qing Restoration King." Chen Guhan was appointed as the military advisor, and they secretly gathered and met a large number of ignorant villagers. They issued "imperial edicts" and "conferred" a large number of "loyal and filial kings, commanders-in-chief of the six armies," "天下兵馬大元帥 (Grand Marshal of All the Armies of the World)," "內廉辦事北陽大臣忠爵侯 (Minister of Internal Affairs, Loyal Duke and Marquis of Beiyang),"... and "Longdong Commander-in-Chief," "Divine Martial Army Commander," "Battalion Commander," "Company Commander" and other positions, as many as fifty or sixty, creating a sensational momentum for a time. Although they have not yet openly recruited soldiers and horses, they have already hidden guns and other weapons, waiting for an opportunity to riot.</p>
<p>Plotting Wrongdoing, All Apprehended</p>
<p>Around September last year, the local authorities detected these conspiratorial parties, and the Fifth District Administrative Office arrested these "monarchs" and "ministers." Except for the active treacherous party members Sang Wenbing and "Commander" Zhang Tao San, who fled far away after hearing the news, the authorities captured "Great Qing Restoration King" Ma Yunlin, "Deputy Deputy Commander," "Battalion Commander," "Company Commander" He Yingqian (56 years old, farmer, Yongjing native), Lu Deli (34 years old, vegetable farmer, Linxia native), Kong Haizhou (56 years old, farmer, Yongjing native), Shi Guoyou (41 years old, farmer, Linxia native), Shi Youcun (45 years old, farmer, Linxia native), Zhao Yuanbi (32 years old, unemployed, Weiyuan native) and other six people, and killed "Military Advisor" Chen Guhan. On the spot, they found the "印 (seal)" of the "Great Qing Restoration King" (9 cm long and 6 cm wide), and two seals of "Minister of Internal Affairs, Loyal Duke and Marquis of Beiyang" (13 cm long and 8.5 cm wide), seven "imperial edicts" finely mounted with yellow silk, two 能戮 (ceremonial weapons), one telescope, one bayonet, and broken waist guns, and eight-sound pistols, one each, and five bullets for pistols and rifles in total. They were immediately escorted to the Gansu Provincial Security Command. After a long period of interrogation, they were transferred to the Special Criminal Court in July of this year and prosecuted, and sentenced the other day.</p>
<p>Prisoners in the Ranks, Shrinking into a Ball</p>
<p>The once sensational "Restoration King" and his subordinates have now become trembling prisoners, quietly listening to the presiding judge reading the judgment: "Ma Yunlin, with the common intention of undermining the national system, prepares to carry out the act of riot, and is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. He Yingqian, Kong Haizhou, Lu Deli, Shi Guoyou, Shi Youcun, and Zhao Yuanbi, with the common intention of undermining the national system, prepare to carry out the act of riot, and are sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights each. Li Wujin is innocent, ... 印章 (seals), 聖旨 (imperial edicts) ... are all confiscated."</p>
<p>Directors of the Strange Drama, Each Displaying Ambition</p>
<p>The director of this "Restoration" strange drama was the treacherous bandit Sang Wenbing, who attempted to disturb the security of the Northwest, while the "military advisor" Chen Guhan wanted to take this opportunity to make some money. It is a pity that these "kings" and their "slaves" who were used by others not only became puppets but also had to go to jail. They complained to reporters: "Alas, we can't even draw the character 'eight' with both hands, how would we know how to be kings? It was all controlled by the dead Taoist. We are really wronged to be sentenced to imprisonment today! We want to appeal!" The ignorant appearance, the pitiful expression, and the feudal words such as "king," "marquis," and "imperial edict" are too far away, too far away!</p>
<p>The Legend of Divine Water Penetrates Poor Villages</p>
<p>In various parts of Gansu, illegal organizations such as the so-called "孔月敎 (Kong Yue Sect)" and "一貫道 (Yiguan Dao)" are currently prevalent. Generally ignorant villagers are alarmed and rushed to join them. Although the local authorities often investigate and ban them, these forces have penetrated into the lower classes of poor and remote areas, using the guise of 神道設敎 (establishing religion through the divine), making it difficult to detect. According to local newspaper reports: 隴西 (Longxi), Gansu, once appeared "紳水 (divine water)," which was said to be able to cure all diseases, even decades of old diseases. Men and women went to draw "紳水 (divine water)" in groups. The county government was afraid that treacherous bandits would take advantage of this opportunity to disturb local security, so it ordered the county health center and the chemistry teacher of Longxi Normal School to test it, proving that the water contained sulfur and could cure diseases, which was completely the effect of 科舉 (imperial examination). Therefore, superstitious legends occurred, and the "god" also revealed its secrets and became ineffective.</p>
<p>Yao 言 (Rumors) Still Rife in Zhang County and Longxi</p>
<p>But this "god" did not disappear. Recently, it has窜 (fled) to Zhang County and 隴西灘兒下 (Tan'erxia, Longxi). These two places have also spread mysterious legends: "A monster from nowhere剪 (cuts) chicken wings in the dead of night, and later directly cuts the bodies of children!" People heard these legends and were half-convinced. Children wore red cloth strips, and red paper pants were pasted on the tops of the gates, and even a盆 (basin) of 淸水 (clear water) was placed in front of the window, in preparation for the "monster" to fall into the 盆 (basin) if it was careless. During the period of suppression of the rebellion, the security authorities should conduct a thorough investigation of these unfounded legends, and social education should also be strengthened, otherwise it is no wonder that the ignorant people will be disturbed by conspirators and运士 (carriers).</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Solves Murder Case; Apprentice Kills Boss Out of Resentment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] On the midnight of the 7th, the Hangzhou Police Bureau solved a murder case. The apprentice of Jiuda Incense and Candle Store on Dongjie Road, Xi Zifang, had been continuously sucked of his essence by the boss, Biao Shengmei. Because he was young and haggard and as thin as firewood, he insisted on becoming self-reliant. He asked Qiu to borrow five taels of gold to do business, but failed. He took a knife to avenge his revenge and killed Qiu. He was discovered by the police and immediately surrendered. The police bureau will send him to the court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Five Members of the Yang Joint Defense Team Arrested by the Xiang (township) Chief of Taixian County</h3>
<p>Yang County Government Lodges a Serious Protest</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 7th] Yan Chao, Li Zhengcai and other five members of the Fourth Joint Defense Military Office of this county were arrested illegally by Yan Haiqiu, the Xiang (township) chief of Zhuangyao Township, Taixian County, while they were active on the border between Yang and Tai counties on the 11th of last month. Five short guns and 40 stone of 麦 (malt) were confiscated, and they were falsely accused of robbery. After being tortured to extract a confession, they were sent to the county and detained by the Taixian County Procuratorate for interrogation. The Jiangdu County Government repeatedly telegraphed for bail, but it was not accepted. Yan Chao died of injury on the 28th, and Li Zhengcai and others are now seriously ill in prison and their lives are in danger. The county government of this county believes that the county government of Taixian County deliberately made things difficult and tortured public officials to death with non-criminal means. In addition to reporting to the Commissioner's Office, it also sent Wang Shiqing, the deputy commander of the Self-Defense Corps, and Xue Guangzu, a councilor, to Taixian County for thorough investigation and serious protest. It is also reported that Cai Zhiyuan, the Xiang (township) chief of Haishan Township in this county, was arrested in Tai, but no trace was found.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary 元動 (Leader) Zhao Shu Died of Illness in Jinyun</h3>
<p>[Jinyun, 6th] Revolutionary 元動 (Leader) Zhao Shu died of illness at Jinyun Health Hospital at 4:20 a.m. on September 5. He was 64 years old. In his early years, he followed the Father of the Nation and ran around for the revolution, participating in the campaign to overthrow Yuan and protect the law. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the party representative of the 26th Army. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was a National Councilor. He did not spare his efforts and was full of righteousness. He never managed his family property in his life, and he was desolate after his death.</p>
<h3>Harvest of Autumn Crops in Hebei; Farm and 物 (Goods) Appear on the Scene One After Another</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Baoding, 7th] Hebei Province has a good harvest of autumn crops, and farm products in various regions have appeared on the market one after another. The vicinity of Central Hebei has suffered slightly from insect pests, and the harvest has been reduced by 30%. Counties near Pingjin and Tang have harvested 60%. Grains and 玉蜀黍 (corn) account for the majority.</p>
<h3>After the Derailment on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Repairs Were Completed Overnight</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 6th (Airmail)] Between Lilang Station and Bukij Station, 132 kilometers from the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, a seventh express train derailment tragedy occurred at around 5:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, killing 28 people and injuring more than 90 people. This is an unprecedented disaster in the history of the railway. Du Zhenyuan, director of the Yuehan Railway, and Xie Wenlong, director of the Guangdong Construction Department, personally went to inspect the scene at around 5:00 p.m. on the 5th. According to Director Du: The traffic accident caused so many deaths and injuries, and I feel very sad. After on-site investigation, it was proved that the responsibility for the accident was entirely due to sabotage by traitors. The sleepers at the derailment site were newly replaced Siamese hardwood sleepers, with no rottenness at all. The roadbed also had no collapse. The steel rails and fishplates at the derailment site were not broken. The most important proof is that the fishplates and bolts connecting the two sections of steel rails at the accident site could not be found everywhere. The connection between the two sections of steel rails also had no twisted marks. It is obvious that the two sections of steel rails had lost contact before the derailment, and the fishplates and bolts were removed by traitors in advance, without any doubt. The Railway Bureau, in view of the inconvenience of suspending transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, worked overnight to repair the road, and the entire line has been operating normally since the 6th. The driving time will be temporarily implemented at 4:30 a.m. before September 1 to ensure safety.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Foreign Exchange by Commercial Firms and庄 (Shops) Extended to Noon Today; More Than 300 Units Declared and Registered Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The declaration and registration work for the transfer of foreign exchange by commercial firms and insurance trust industries in this city to the Central Bank was originally limited to 4:00 p.m. yesterday. However, due to the facts, it was decided to extend it to noon today. More than 300 units declared and registered yesterday. Most of the larger firms and companies have completed the declaration and registration procedures. Some small firms have had their forms returned for reprocessing because they were not familiar with the procedures and many of the forms were not in compliance with the regulations. After the registration forms are collected today, Director Lin Chong will go to Beijing tonight to submit them to the Ministry of Finance for review, and then the ministry will issue an order to announce all the detailed figures.</p>
<p>[Zhong Shi She, Nanjing, 9th] Xu Botu, the former Finance Secretary, went to Shanghai for the transfer of foreign exchange assets of firms to state-owned banks, and returned to Beijing this morning after completing his work. He told reporters: All commercial banks in Shanghai are complying with government orders and have been declaring to the Central Bank since the 8th, which will be closed before 4:00 p.m. on the 9th, and there should be no problems in general. If there are those who do not comply with the law and dare to delay the declaration, the government will impose appropriate penalties. As for the total amount of foreign exchange transferred, it is still being collected and reported, and the total amount may not be as huge as rumored by foreign countries. Xu also said: At present, in order to stabilize the economy, the government is doing its best to implement the established policies, but it also depends on the public's psychological stability and confidence in the currency.</p>
<h3>Stores Still Not Buying Much, Rice Prices Trending Downward, Grain and Oil Markets Also See Declines</h3>
<p>The rice market is shrinking again, with market momentum continuing to trend downward. Quotes in Xishi are weak, and rice stores are still not buying much. Coupled with clear weather, increased arrivals are expected. Therefore, although the market opened flat, it ultimately saw a slight decline at closing due to sluggish sales and a lack of confidence. In the southern market, the price was said to have fallen by three jiao early on. White japonica rice and thin japonica rice both reportedly dropped by three jiao. New indica rice opened at twenty yuan, and new japonica rice also saw a decline. Only white glutinous rice remained firm at the limit price due to scarcity. Prices in the northern market are still stable, but the market is also particularly weak. Arrivals in the two markets totaled three thousand and twenty shi.</p>
<p>Flour transactions were not numerous, and prices were slightly weak. The largest decline was less than one jiao, because reports indicated that flour was also prohibited from being exported. This will inevitably cut off retail sales in the interior, leading to a decline in confidence and a decrease in purchases. Old Che brand opened at the previous day's original price, and closed slightly lower by two fen. Bingchuan brand closed at seven yuan and two jiao, a decrease of five fen. Sales of miscellaneous brands were particularly sluggish, declining by four or five fen. Jiancheng brand fell by nine fen. Rumors circulated that the factory would be opening for bran, which was slightly weak by two fen. Wheat remained at the original price.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The market momentum turned weak. Soybean sales have completely ceased, and oil mill purchases have also decreased. Purchases of new beans on this street are also not good, and the market shows signs of weakness. Qingdao merchants are handling more corn, adding one jiao. Red sorghum sales to the north are smooth, and high-quality products are fairly stable. Inferior yuanmai is being used by alcohol factories, and the price has fallen. There were few transactions for both tea beans and broad beans. Sesame seeds and main kernels were both transacted at the limit price, with the former being firm and the latter being weak.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Flat and weak. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil saw slight declines. Inventories on this street are mostly sufficient, so there are not many buyers in the market. Oil mills opened at a price two jiao lower. Datong soybean oil was forty-nine yuan and five jiao, and rapeseed oil was reduced by five jiao to forty-five yuan and five jiao. Raw oil is still firm because Qingdao has banned exports and inventories are low. Small Che sesame oil is also firm and expensive due to depleted inventories, opening at a net price of fifty yuan. Foreign merchants still have no appetite for soybean cakes, with the factory price at four yuan and six jiao, and returned goods reduced by one jiao.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangling steamer arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying four thousand bags of rice and four hundred and fifty barrels of tung oil from Changsha. It is currently berthed at the Jinliyuan Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: The Yangtze River route has recently seen improvements in shipping. The Jiangling, Jiangning, Sanbei Ruitai, and other steamers are all transporting large quantities of yarn, cloth, and daily necessities to Han and Xiang.</p>
<h3>Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exchange Statistics for Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency exchanged by the Central Bank and entrusted banks in recent days has been quite low compared to the first few days. Yesterday's results were particularly good. The total amount of exchange was as follows:</p>
<p>Gold: 28,640.486 taels</p>
<p>Silver: 25,995.65 taels</p>
<p>Silver Dollars: 115,454.17</p>
<p>U.S. Dollars: 755,819.47</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dollars: 192,200.05</p>
<p>The total value was 9,204,418,945 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Clearing Balance for Banks and Bureaus</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a total clearing deficit of 1.1 million in the exchange of bills among silver and money businesses. The Central Bank had a surplus of 140,000, the Bank of China had a deficit of 530,000, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 440,000, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 390,000, the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 250,000, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a deficit of 370,000, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a balanced clearing. Commercial banks and firms had a surplus of 2.53 million in large exchanges and a deficit of 1.42 million in small exchanges. Foreign banks had a total deficit of 10,000.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of the Previous Six Measures for Short-Term Lending by Provincial and Municipal Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the point that provincial and municipal local banks, if necessary, should provide short-term loans to local, normally operating banks and firms, the Ministry of Finance had stipulated six measures. It is now known that since the revised and promulgated measures to strengthen financial business control, there have been strict restrictions on the deposit and loan items of provincial and municipal banks. All six measures originally set by the Ministry of Finance have been explicitly ordered to be terminated by the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Export Exchange Settlement Amount</h3>
<p>The amount of foreign exchange applied for settlement for exported goods from Shanghai last week (August 29 to September 4) decreased slightly compared to the previous week. The total figure converted to U.S. dollars was $4,175,217.13. This included the amount for exported goods for which the government settled foreign exchange itself (i.e., frozen eggs, yarn, cloth, ore, sugar, etc.), totaling $1,032,537.73.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Fabrics to be Sold in India, Threatening Our Indian Market</h3>
<p>The Silk Weaving Guidance Association Decides to Clear Stock Immediately</p>
<p>In order to increase exports and earn foreign exchange, the Central Bank led the organization of the Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee last year, which processed and exported raw silk controlled by the government. Over 90,000 bolts of silk and satin were shipped to India for sale, of which one-third has been sold, and two-thirds remain. After the 10th of this month, the Indian ban on the import of raw silk and silk fabrics will definitely be lifted. Japanese silk and silk fabrics will be shipped to India, and our Indian market will face serious threats. All of these silks and satins should be sold as soon as possible to facilitate the closing.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, the Silk Weaving Export Guidance Association specially invited relevant agencies yesterday to discuss the handling methods. Chen Shuzeng, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Manager Ma Jiping, Deputy Manager Sun Zurui of the Bank of China, Commissioner Zhou Dagang of the China Trust Bureau, General Manager Ge Jingzhong of the Silk Company, and more than ten representatives of the silk weaving industry attended the discussion. The result was a decision to clear the remaining stock in India in the near future. The selling price will be calculated based on the actual cost. In the past, silk and satin were sold in India at a limited price, with a minimum price of four rupees per yard. Now it will be below four rupees.</p>
<h3>Inexhaustible Supply from Enemy Code, Abundant Cotton Yarn, Market Prices Flat and Weak, Yong'an Yarn Factory Participates in Yarn Allocation for the First Time Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was quite lively due to the autumn sales season. Confidence among various parties was still relatively stable. The supply from various yarn factories in the market was inexhaustible. However, foreign merchants' appetite was sluggish, and some even turned from buyers to sellers. The prices of coarse and fine yarns mostly fell to the limit. Transactions have entered a normal track.</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: Yong'an Textile Company entrusted the Yarn Business Association to open sales of 400 packages of yarn of various brands from 10 to 60 counts. The association opened sales to its members by lottery at 3:00 PM. Regardless of whether there had been previous transactions, the lottery was drawn according to the number sequence. Each member received one package, and the payment was exchanged for the warehouse receipt by bank draft before 11:00 AM on the 11th.</p>
<p>The details are as follows: 140 packages of 10-count Jiahe yarn, priced at 488 yuan. 120 packages of 32-count Jincheng yarn, priced at 830 yuan. 60 packages of 40-count Jincheng yarn, priced at 859 yuan. 40 packages of 40-count double-strand Jincheng yarn, priced at 1,030 yuan. 40 packages of 60-count double-strand Jincheng yarn, priced at 1,250 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was rumored to have restricted exports, and foreign merchants were unable to ship goods. It was also heard that foreign firms required certification from the local industry association before purchasing goods. Therefore, the selling atmosphere in the market became more intense, and those holding goods were selling a lot. Coupled with the distribution period of the Fangjian Company, the supply was particularly smooth. Although retail sales in the market were strong, it was difficult for people to be optimistic in the end.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened with a drop of nine jiao and finally stood at 28 yuan, a significant drop of eight jiao compared to the previous day. Other sparse cloths also saw declines because the distribution price of Fangjian Company was slightly lower than the market price. Only Tiaoli Yuan biji was sought after, and the market was uniquely firm. Colored cloth and shilin cloth remained at the original price. Total transactions for the day were six hundred and sixty bolts.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company opened cloth as usual yesterday, resulting in a total of 14,340 bolts of cloth and 540 blankets being booked. A total of 257 households applied, including 26 factory households, who purchased 4,880 bolts of cloth, and 231 cloth stores, who purchased 9,460 bolts of cloth and 540 blankets. Fangjian Company received a total payment of 350,810 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, due to reorganization, the company will temporarily suspend yarn opening for one day today. All yarn to be allocated to the reprocessing industry on that day will be re-allocated on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Increased Sales Volume of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The woolen goods merchants have always maintained normal supply for retail sales, and the recent sales volume has increased several times compared to before August 19. The reason for the decrease in wholesale sales is that the factory's allocation of goods is insufficient, so retail sales have had to be reduced. The prices of wholesale goods are normal.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cloth, and Foreign Currency Exchanged for 80,000 Tons of Indian Cotton in One Month</h3>
<p>According to news from the Textile Export Committee, the committee's handling of the exchange of yarn and cloth for Indian cotton has resulted in a total of 80,000 tons of Indian cotton being exchanged from July to the present. The amount of yarn and cloth shipped from our country was 45,000 pieces. According to this ratio, the adjustment of raw cotton for domestic textile factories is of great benefit. Especially during the period of scarcity, domestic yarn factories have almost entirely spun Indian cotton. After the establishment of the New Flower Yarn and Cloth Guidance Committee, the exchange of yarn and cloth for Indian cotton will be specially strengthened.</p>
<h3>Pinellia Ternata Sales Not Smooth</h3>
<p>The new goods of the traditional Chinese medicine Pinellia ternata are already on the way. It is heard that this year's production in Sichuan is the same as in previous years. The production in Shiyang, eastern Zhejiang, is slightly lower than last year. The production in eastern areas has greatly decreased because most tenant farmers have wandered to other places and most have not started planting, amounting to less than one-tenth of previous years. Recently, sales of goods in the market have not been smooth, falling below the limit price to 158 yuan. However, the selected and unified grades are selling well and remain firm at the limit price. Peaches and apricots are becoming more susceptible to insects, and prices are collapsing to 59 yuan and 5 jiao, with the trend still declining. The production of Job's tears in Pucheng has also suffered a poor harvest.</p>
<h3>Lack of Change in Sales, Sparse Transactions in Domestic Tea</h3>
<p>In recent days, domestic tea has lacked change due to alternating ins and outs. As for the foreign tea market, the trend has repeatedly shown a positive outlook. Upon consideration, the stock of various goods is increasingly depleted, and the raw tea such as fried green and baked green tea in the producing areas is increasing. Merchants feel that the cost of reproduction in the future will be high. Therefore, the supply is scarce, and the asking price is not discouraged. However, exporters are still happy to purchase, and the process is showing a situation of supply not meeting demand. Transactions are deserted, and the market has finally made progress. Recently, industry insiders said that the French economic delegation is very fond of the Zhenmei green tea and other teas that are popular in North Africa. If they start buying, they will sweep them away. Looking at the future, it can be said to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>People are nervous about sugar, and they are selling out one after another, selling 17th-term raw sugar warehouse receipts for 28 yuan, and spot goods for 28 yuan and 6 jiao, each falling by one yuan sharply. White sugar and medium sugar have also fallen to the limit price one after another, with the former at 30 yuan and 5 jiao, and the latter at 26 yuan and 3 jiao. Local sugar continues to be traded according to the limit.</p>
<p>The Silk Beam Association has recently agreed to allocate 600 bolts each to Dachen and Huaqiang, and 300 bolts each to Meiya and Jinsun, for a total of 1,800 bolts, all allocated to members of the association's sales group at the 819 limit price of 36 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>Timber transactions remain calm. According to Fu, the price of fir in the producing area is still high, at about 9.5 fen to 1 jiao and 1 fen per foot.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market: Various cigarettes were traded slightly within the limit. Manufacturers distributed more goods. Each tobacco retailer sold various cigarettes well. Soap was slightly positive because retail sales were more than offset. Various soaps were slightly higher by 3 jiao to 5 jiao compared to yesterday, with Guben soap at 26 yuan and 5 jiao, and Xiangmao soap at 20 yuan and 5 jiao, both of which were traded.</p>

<p>[Dahua News Agency Dispatch] The Municipal Education and Youth Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Education, specifically commending it for achieving excellent results in national education. The text of the Ministry's order is recorded below: "It has been found that the performance evaluation of the Education Bureaus of various provinces and cities for the thirty-sixth year has been completed.

However, it seems that management of private schools should still be strengthened. Municipal elementary schools must select and employ educational professionals as much as possible, and those with political or local ties should be replaced or reappointed.</p>
<h3>Academic Conference of the Beiping Research Institute, Hu Shi, Li Shuhua, and Others Give Speeches</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, September 9] The academic research conference of the Beiping Research Institute opened this morning. Li Shizeng represented Chairman Wu Zhihui, and the 19th-anniversary meeting of the institute was held in combination. Forty-three northern members attended. Li Shizeng gave the opening speech, tracing the origins of research institutes in China back to 1919. Vice President Li Shuhua reported on the general situation, recounting the work of the institute's nine research institutes, including physics, radium, chemistry, pharmaceuticals, physiology, zoology, botany, history, and the Northwest Botanical Survey Institute.</p>
<p>Li Shuhua Points Out the Achievements of the Research Institute</p>
<p>And especially pointed out that the Institute of Atomic Nuclei has been changed to the Institute of Atomic Energy, with Qian Sanqiang concurrently serving as director. The Institute of Physics is manufacturing optical instruments to meet the needs of various parties. The Institute of Pharmaceuticals has now identified that the three homologous isomeric molecules contained in "Changshan Salt" have particularly strong anti-malarial properties, exceeding quinine by 100 to 2,000 times. Li said that the scarcity of funds after the war has greatly affected the work. He hopes that the government will pay attention to this point and emphasized that Chinese scholars should bear a part of the world's responsibility. The institute discussed the issue of the research institute system in the afternoon and elected Wu Zhihui as chairman.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, September 9] The academic conference of the Ping Research Institute opened today. Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, and Yan Jici, director of the Institute of Physics of the Ping Research Institute, successively gave speeches.</p>
<p>Hu Shi Advocates Increasing the Number of Research Institutes</p>
<p>(1) Hu Shi: He believes that China is so large that, in addition to the Academia Sinica, there is only one local research institute, the Ping Research Institute, which is really too few. Therefore, he advocates that research institutes should be established in cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, and in regions such as Zhejiang, Southwest, and Northwest. Hu praised the Ping Research Institute for having more than 600 papers in a short period of 19 years, and its achievements are considered excellent in the world. Therefore, he lamented that China has only had modern universities and research institutions for 50 to 60 years, and the history is very short, and there is a general lack of money, but as long as we work hard, the development of Chinese academic research will still have a bright future.</p>
<p>The Method of Awarding Doctorates Should Be Put into Effect</p>
<p>Hu advocated that research institutes should accept apprentices and condemned the government for formulating the method of awarding doctoral degrees in 1933, but it has never taken effect, resulting in no one being able to obtain a doctoral degree from within the country for more than ten years. He also opposed the government monopolizing the matter and believed that it should be awarded by universities with research institutes. Hu requested that those who had participated in the master's degree examinations at Peking University and Tsinghua University could prove that their level was definitely not inferior to that of foreign doctors. The government should believe this fact. Therefore, during his recent trip to Beijing, in addition to attending the meeting of the Academia Sinica, he decided to submit this suggestion to the government, and especially hoped that President Zhang Boling, who came from a university, would promote it.</p>
<p>Mei Yiqi Emphasizes That Academic Research Has No Regional Boundaries</p>
<p>(2) Mei Yiqi emphasized that academic research should not have regional concepts and should pay attention to cultivating future generations, saying that there are only a few hundred people currently engaged in academic research in China. Finally, he hoped that everyone would cooperate sincerely. (3) Yan Jici: Yan pointed out that there are 30 to 40 times more people engaged in academic research today than ten years ago, but the equipment is getting less and less.</p>

<h3>Peiping Sports Festival - Commemorative Meeting Held - Speeches by Yuan Dunli and Ma John</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 9th] The Peiping September 9th Sports Festival was held at the National Theater under the direction of the City Education Bureau. Yuan Dunli and Ma John gave speeches, discussing the meaning of the September 9th Sports Festival and hoping that those in the sports community would correct the erroneous idea that "sports activities are only for those who study physical education." They emphasized strengthening amateur sports activities, without needing to discuss advanced theories, and should cultivate their own and the public's appreciation of sports activities, so that sports activities can penetrate into the people. Mr. Ma spoke about his understanding of sports, dividing it into three points: (1) Sports is not just about competition, but should recognize what kind of exercise is suitable for training what kind of physique and age group. (2) Do not use rigid methods for exercise, but determine new exercise styles based on the needs of the times. (3) Those in the sports community should use a fixed method to train themselves. He concluded by saying that the meaning of self-improvement is for others. Afterwards, the Physical Education College performed, and various ball games were held in the afternoon at the Sports Field of Fu Jen Catholic University.</p>

<p>Free Talk - Fat Talk - Lao Liu</p>
<p>Thirteen or fourteen years ago, when I had just graduated from university, before the war had started and when my family was still relatively well-off, my weight was 107 pounds. Ma John, a senior figure in the sports world, patted me on the shoulder and said, "Child, you're too light. Eat, eat more!"</p>
<p>Today, I've managed to find a small job where I'm neither rich nor starving, I'm busy every day, I often have to put up with other people's bad moods, and I have a wife and children, so my burdens have naturally increased a lot. And yet - strangely enough, my weight has changed to 187 pounds, and I've become the number one fat man in the office!</p>
<p>Whenever I run into friends on the street, they inevitably say to me with a smile, "Ah, you're fatter than before! A broad mind and a fat body, you must be having a great time, old chap!"</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a group of my university classmates had a reunion dinner at the alumni association. One of them had just come from Peiping, and we hadn't seen each other for over ten years. When we started catching up, he said, "Everyone else is still the same, except for Lao Liu" - he pointed at me and said with a laugh - "Lao Liu, if I ran into you on the street, I wouldn't even dare say hello to you. After so many years, to become so 'grand', it's really unexpected."</p>
<p>To be honest, I myself find it unexpected. Looking at photos from the past, I was thin and tall, with something of the air of Yang Xiaolou; now, alas! I have to admit, I have something of the demeanor of Hao Shouchang. As for my circumstances, in these past ten years or so, have I ever had such carefree days as in university? Airplanes were strafing overhead, and if you went to look, the corrugated iron sheets were full of bullet holes. My family's financial situation is also much worse than before. Renting rice is unprofitable, and I've been robbed by thieves several times. I've never found a satisfactory job, and I've neglected my studies for so many years that I've forgotten a large part of what I learned in university. After "drifting" along for more than ten years, I've suddenly "drifted" into being a big fat man, which is really quite strange.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw a weekly supplement to the New York Herald Tribune at the home of a colleague. There was an article titled "Are You Too Fat?" As soon as I saw it, my heart couldn't help but be moved, and I quickly borrowed it to lie on the bed and read it carefully. I found an answer that I was eager to know - according to experts, being fat doesn't necessarily mean having a broad mind, and gaining weight is unrelated to getting rich; on the contrary, the more unhappy you are, the more likely you are to gain weight.</p>
<p>For example, Dr. Harry Gold, a professor at Cornell University Medical College, said: "The reason for obesity is often a bad mood. When people are unhappy, they often like to eat, saying that it can relieve boredom and sorrow, and as a result, they develop a habit of eating too much. This habit is not easy to break, and psychological treatment is necessary to help."</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Binger said: "Most fat people are fat because they eat too much. Why do they eat so much? Because they often feel hungry. And the reason for hunger is often anxiety. People who are anxious and worried often feel hungry."</p>
<p>Anxiety causes people to eat more. This saying cannot be said to be without reason. In Homer's epic "The Iliad", the warriors are overwhelmed with grief when mourning their fallen comrades, but after the mourning ceremony is over, they immediately eat and drink heavily. Homer uses many lines of poetry to describe how they prepare a grand feast and how they become drunk and full. When I read this passage many years ago, I couldn't help but laugh at it, but now it seems to be exactly what Aldous Huxley called "the whole truth".</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read the memoirs of a certain gentleman who said that after Yuan Shikai was dressed in the dragon robe, he gradually realized that the situation was not right. One morning, he got up early to read telegrams, and when he saw that the overall situation had reached a point beyond salvation, he couldn't help but become lost in thought - his right hand was holding the telegram, and his left hand was putting the steamed buns that were next to him for breakfast into his mouth one by one: he ate as many as eighty buns!</p>
<p>Whether the warriors in Homer's writings were fat is yet to be verified, but it is likely that they were not thin; Yuan Shikai's image is known to all through the coins: fat.</p>
<p>Among the characters in Shakespeare's plays, "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" can be considered melancholic, and European scholars who specialize in Shakespeare say: "Hamlet may have syphilis - he is a fat man."</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the rich people. If you want to talk about millionaires, you naturally have to go to America. Okay, look at the photos of Ford who passed away last year. Ford can be said to be rich, but he was a skinny, wizened old man! What about the oil tycoon Rockefeller? He was also thin! Not to mention anything else, everyone knows that Americans are rich, but isn't the symbol of America, Uncle Sam, a thin old man with a goatee?</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I can't help but stand up and look in the mirror. My fatness remains the same - alas!</p>
<p>On Hobbies - Why Bother</p>
<p>Life is valuable because of hobbies.</p>
<p>People need a normal occupation to maintain their livelihood; they also need one or more hobbies to regulate their lives, or, artistically speaking, to decorate their lives, just as curtains are used to decorate glass windows.</p>
<p>A normal occupation is like a person's pair of eyes, while hobbies are like the eyelashes that grow around the eyes. The function of eyelashes is not only to decorate the bright eyes, but also to prevent dust from entering the eye membrane. Life is also like this. When sand and mud are mixed into life, you will feel melancholy and annoyed. The only thing that can prevent dust from entering the eye membrane of life is a hobby.</p>
<p>Originally, the occupation that we are usually engaged in, when we first stepped into the office belonging to this occupation, even if there were words such as "interested in" and "willing to regard as a lifelong career" written on the application you filled out, after years of accumulation, there will inevitably be a day when you feel bored. There is a folk saying that "if you eat from one profession, you will be wronged in that profession," which is a conclusion obtained from accumulated experience. Why is it that you were determined to be interested in the beginning, but in the end you feel "wronged"? The key lies in the fact that once the occupation you are engaged in becomes a means of maintaining your livelihood, it is like the work of grinding rice into flour, and your Excellency is the donkey turning the millstone. "Bitterly hating pressing the needle and thread year after year, making wedding clothes for others!" This is the donkey's cry.</p>
<p>Regarding donkeys grinding flour, we can encounter this monotonous scene when traveling to small cities. A donkey whose eyes are covered with screens is tethered to the handle of the millstone, turning in a small circle, squeaking and groaning, what a monotonous chore! In the old days, there was a hired worker who did exactly the work of replacing a donkey - grinding flour every day, and the letters he wrote back home were mostly hidden complaints: "The hat is like the sea, the socks are like the river, the feet don't leave the door, but I walk a thousand miles a day. If there is a boat, I will walk home as a boat puller." The last two sentences indicate that the hired worker's income is meager, and if he wants to go home, he must wait for a convenient boat to go to the countryside and work as a boat puller for others. It is a universal rule in the universe that there will inevitably be resentment in an occupation that is engaged in for the sake of making a living; however, we must make a living, and there is no way to get rid of a normal occupation, so we can only pursue a way to regulate it, and that is to promote hobbies.</p>
<p>Someone's hobby may seem like a "wronged" occupation to others, but because people with this kind of hobby do not belong to the work of donkeys grinding flour, it is a pleasure to regulate life. Therefore, President Roosevelt, in addition to managing all kinds of affairs, used fishing as a way to regulate his body and mind, and angling became Roosevelt's hobby, even though in the eyes of fishermen who "fish for a living", angling is a heavy burden.</p>
<p>Gamblers are listless in the office, but as soon as four people get together to make a table, they appear energetic, and even if they gamble all night, they are not tired, as the saying goes, "When the dominoes click, the eyes become clear." However, we are against hobbies that are addicted to alcohol, because after indulging in them, they waste time and lose their jobs, and fall into the evil path of indulging in things and losing their ambition, and their behavior is no longer healthy.</p>
<p>Therefore, hobbies must fall within the category of "good hobbies", so that they can help normal occupations. They must be like machine oil, so that after people obtain them, they can make normal work progress smoothly and reduce the troubles of torment.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say: life is valuable because of hobbies.</p>
<p>American Tidbits - Hams</p>
<p>In the eight months since the establishment of the International Refugee Organization, 67,078 refugees have been repatriated, and 192,494 refugees have been assisted by the organization to stay abroad.</p>
<p>The annual salary of the US Secretary of State is $15,000, but Marshall's work as Secretary of State is entirely voluntary and he does not receive a salary. Originally, in his capacity as a retired Army General, he could receive a lifetime annual salary of $15,751, and according to law, he cannot receive two official salaries at the same time.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Hu Yaguang writes: "The article 'Zhang Zixiang and Feng Chaoran', which was published some time ago, was written after hearing elders talk about the childhood histories of successful people at home and abroad. In a moment of excitement, I wrote and sent it to this column without thinking, based on the principle of 'heroes not fearing humble origins'. Mr. Feng is one of the people I admire in my life, and there was no ulterior motive whatsoever. I would like to offer my sincere apologies to Mr. Feng and request that you correct the (mistake) on my behalf."</p>
<p>(2) The Municipal Health Bureau writes: "After reviewing the article 'Garbage', which was published in your newspaper's 'Free Talk' column on August 22, regarding the accumulation of garbage at 930 Lane, Liyang Road, which is detrimental to hygiene, we ordered the Sanitation Brigade to investigate and reply: 'Mr. Liu's residence at No. 8 in the lane is under renovation, resulting in a large amount of concrete being dumped in the lane, which is not garbage. We have ordered the soldiers to remove it completely.' We hereby request that you check and disclose this information. (The following is omitted.)</p>
<p>Evasion of Military Service - Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Bai Juyi's poem "The Old Man with a Broken Arm of Xinfeng" has been listed as anti-war literature by some, and is also included in middle school Chinese textbooks. At that time, warlords were fighting each other, and there were anti-war calls among the people. Looking at it today, it is indeed a relic. The current regulations on punishing crimes that obstruct military service state: "Those who incite others to avoid military service shall be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years in peacetime and imprisonment of one to seven years in wartime." Therefore, even when discussing poetry and ancient history, one must be cautious. The previous regulations also state: "Those who intentionally injure their bodies shall be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years." Those who fear the law should not imitate what the old man of Xinfeng did. The old man of Xinfeng must have broken his arm in the dead of night, knowing that it was illegal. The Tang Code states: "Or there are those who falsely accuse others of crimes in order to seek pushback; or intentionally commit minor offenses, even staying on the run; or intentionally injure themselves; or falsely claim to be ill." This shows that in the Tang Dynasty, there were many people who avoided military service, and their techniques were clever, and the government had strictly guarded against them. Some say, would those who would rather lose an arm be afraid of several years of imprisonment? Suppose there are those who cut off their hands and feet and then receive punishment, after the term of imprisonment is over, they will never be able to serve in the military. The law is sometimes exhausted, and if patriotism is strong, everyone will strive to serve, and there is no news of self-mutilation to avoid service. Therefore, it is better to guide people with virtue than to punish them with law.</p>
<p>Excerpts from the Continued Collection of Clouds Between the Titled Orchids (Part 1) - Jilan</p>
<p>There are petty people, and then we see gentlemen, but gentlemen do not cut off things, they are harmonious but different, and their pure fragrance is far away. (1)</p>
<p>Changshu Su</p>
<p>Someone asked a man from Luoyang to write an orchid for Mr. Yun Jian, saying that it must be exquisite so that it could be offered to a new noble; the gentleman said: this public is just a few pounds of meat. (1) It is better to buy more green and red and ask Shi Shi to paint peonies. The person said: What about me? The gentleman said: Slightly bony, should get a brush.</p>
<p>Ji Yuan</p>
<p>Guangchang fed chickens, and I waited on my mother. Soon I saw that the chicken was full and lying in the shade of the banana tree, so I arranged the paper to repay the kindness of the dust-free elegance! On the sixth month of the year of Wuzi, Bai Jiao wrote Ji Yuan for Brother Renguang.</p>
<p>Hui Yongchun Mei</p>
<p>The orchid has a famous big fortune, and Yun asked if he loved its flower but hated its name; there is a famous big one, and Yun Jian thought it was harmless.</p>
<p>Xiuqi an monk spoke to a layman one day about Huangshan Orchid, the leaves were one span long, and the fragrance was heard for ten miles, and the layman was already longing for it. Today, I use a large brush to write a huge painting, and the monk looked at it and said: It is exactly a realistic portrayal of a corner of the waterfall, when did the layman enter the mountain? Yun Jian wrote down the matter.</p>
<p>Exposed Root Orchid</p>
<p>Answering the spring light, Lu Sui is in the mud, so he pretends to be in this state, and the heart is not far away. I hope to show it to A Chang, so that he can be brave and decisive. I wish my heart were good!</p>
<p>Although Chu has talent, he threatens Shichuan; Shen Ni is in the village, a master Qiu is ear-ten steps away, there must be fragrant grass, the world sees dimly, who can see it again? I write this with sigh!</p>
<p>Da Yipin</p>
<p>The secluded fragrance has escaped, I don't know if I will go out of the mountain in the evening, so that the world can see this one product!</p>
<p>Shanghai Plum</p>
<p>The mountain wife did not know where she found a piece of paper, and looked at it and smiled secretly; when I released the scroll, I stretched it out in front of my eyes and said: This gentleman used to paint shepherd's purse! Now add vigor and call it orchid. The layman said: If I write Huangshan Plum, the lady will think it is a cattail, less seen, so much is strange, the same disease in ancient and modern times! In fact, the layman has not been to Huangshan, only heard the monk say it, haha! Fu Weng fills in the blank.</p>
<p>Stream Orchid</p>
<p>There are lush grasses in the Central Plains, and there are orchids in the remote streams, I do not look at you, I speak with eternal sigh!</p>
<p>Moon Pendant</p>
<p>The scorching heat of the day makes it impossible to sleep, and the cool morning has the fun of scattered flowers. Boil a pot of tea, carefully grind ink, stretch paper and catch a pen, and the happy women and children are in their dreams, and there are no early visitors to disturb them. I got this, so I sent it to my Ximing regret Wai, and those who touched the heat have not seen it!</p>
<p>The spring breeze is as old as ever, the orchid words are forgotten, and the clouds of Dongshan enter the gentleman's hall together!</p>
<p>Jilan</p>
<p>Dongpo Weng wrote flowers and bamboos, mixed with thorns, meaning that a gentleman can tolerate petty people; Fu Weng is a righteous thorn to protect the fragrant envoys, and if you ask Si Qing Weng, you should be the first. In the midsummer of Wuzi, after the rain, there was a little coolness, and suddenly a clear interest moved me, so I wrote this and casually inscribed it.</p>
<p>Emerald Canopy Lotus</p>
<p>I don't see guests for half a day, and I get several books and forget to see people and be happy! Send it to Yuan Weng Qing for appreciation. If Shi Ran sees it, he should be a pavilion.</p>
<p>Potted Orchid</p>
<p>The afternoon wine has not woken up, the hand is floating and the eyes are small, and the oath is made with Yan A, so I got this frame. Please do not judge each other by artistic matters, you should cherish this treasure for the world!</p>
<p>Yang Su Lotus</p>
<p>Or the news of hoeing orchids, "Summer" room is cold, thinking of Xiao Weng's sigh of no land, different times of the same pain!</p>
<p>Clear</p>
<p>I write my intentions, how can I follow the secular track to seek coloring? Try to taste it in leisure and silence, don't you see that you want to spit out words when you face each other? What should I report, I already know it, a chuckle!</p>
<p>Double Cluster Mountain Orchid</p>
<p>Many people eat poorly, and children's games have come to this point. A certain old woman said: If I can get Jian Yunwen to live in my hands, I will have no worries when I am old! Yun Jian Sheng said: But what if there are more children? If it is a golden hand, it will definitely be given away! Bai Jiu's playful writing.</p>
<p>Simple Brush Guan</p>
<p>People want to ask for more, but the son wants to ask for less, people want to persecute, but the son says, let's wait a while, saying that it is not Xiang Zu's confidant, so he is already happy with the orchid king!</p>
<p>Thorns</p>
<p>Scattered wood is born with my feelings, and I will offer my ink to it for a hundred years, Yun: I only got two, one of which will be kept as a legacy. If I can make my jasmine shine outside the thorns, and this heart is clear, Jiangshang is not in vain!</p>
