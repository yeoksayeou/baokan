<h3>上半年度總預算案立院決議重付審查　郵電加價案准補完程序</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕立法院五日例會討論總預算案，決議重付五委會聯席會議審查，附帶具體建議，於十二日大會討論。嗣討論行政院提　補完立法程序之郵電加價案，各委員成認政院此行違法作風亟應糾正，決議准予通渦，但附帶聲明，以後郵電加需更價格，須依辦理，不得隨意變動，最後將劉志平所提建議案（見另條）修正通過。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕立法院木年復會後首次例會，五日晨舉行，討論三十七年度上半年國家總預算，孫科院長主席，國府主計長徐堪，行政院長張羣，財政部長兪鴻鈞均列席，首由立院法制委會委員長劉克備報吿四日聯席會議審查經過，略謂：「總預算之編製原應根據施政方針，現因行憲在即，而常前過渡之政府無法擬定木年度之施政方針，故該半年度之預算乃依照上年度之預算及追加而援用，初步編　歲入爲三十三萬七千一百四十八億餘元，歲出爲卅六萬九千四百三十八億餘元，但因動員戡亂之需要，國防費用之增加及文武人員待遇調整，故上年度預算之科目已有不合，且因數字過大，無法列入，故主計處將本年度上半年之總刊算分為普通與特別兩部門，普通部門之收人以經常賦稅爲財源，而支出亦爲經常支出，此部門預算可以平衡。特別部門多爲非常支出及戡亂之所需，如國防費用即以三分之二列人，而另以三分之一列人普通之歲出部門。</p>
<p>普通歲入歲出均爲廿三萬四千五百五十一億四千三百九十七萬元，特別預算歲入，財部有把握者為一十四萬八千七百七十五億元，歲出爲六十六萬七百一十二億六千一百五十二萬元，不敷之數在未籌抵補辦法前，在歲入門列爲　款收入。</p>
<p>普通特別兩部合計歲出爲九十萬二千二百六十四億五百四十九萬元，歲入爲三十八萬三千三百二十六億四千三百九十七萬元，其收支不敷者達五十一萬八千九百三十七億六千一百五十二萬元，已在特別部門列爲債款收入，不敷之數約佔百分之六十。後經國務會議審議經特稱委員會審査，在歲入方面增列一年印花，關稅，直接稅，貨物稅，礦稅，美軍剩餘物資，接收敵偽物資，國有營業盈餘，日本賠償物資售價及出售國營事業等共增廿萬零八十二億五千三百萬元，增列之數，財政部聲明如無意外變動，可以做到，並原列歲入爲五十八萬三千四百零八億九千六百九十七萬元。在歲出方面，調整生活補助费準備金項下增列二萬億元，國防部主管項下增四萬億元，其他項目亦略有調整。</p>
<p>調整結果即主計處最後編製送院審議文件所載之數字如下：普通預算；歲入一十六款，歲出二十九款，各爲二十六萬六千一百五十一億一千八百八十九萬元，特別預算；歲入九款，爲三十一萬七千二百五十七億七千八百零八萬元，債款收入爲三十七萬九千三百五十七億零三百四十四萬元，歲出一十一款，爲六十九萬六千六百十四億八千一百五十二萬元。</p>
<p>普通特別兩部門合計歲出爲九十六萬二千七百六十六億零四十一萬元，歲入爲五十八萬三千四百零八億九千六百九十七萬元，約當歲出總額百分之六十一。</p>
<p>上案討論結果，決定待行政當局政策說明後重付審査。</p>
<h3>上半年總預算　三項重要支出　張羣出席立院會議加以說明</h3>
<p>劉氏報吿畢，由張院長說明行憲在即，國務會議決定現政府爲過渡性質，未便爲行憲後之政府代擬施政方針，仍沿用去歲舊有者故預算亦採伸算辦法，較去年度者略有更正，總預算中有三項事要支出：</p>
<p>軍費；去歲預算自五月以後，裁軍達三百萬人，及動員戡亂令下後，軍費終止减縮，復恢復原預算，充實二十兵團，增加支出極大，今年預算巾亦佔數頗大。</p>
<p>生活補貼：因求文武職人員待遇之平等及依生活指數調整待遇。此項支出在總預算中佔六十三萬億元多。</p>
<p>敎育經費：依照憲法規定，敎育經費應依中央預算百分之十五，此次過渡時期之預算應勿使離憲法規定過遠，故約依百分之十三列入，將來調整較易。由於些三項預算之增加，支出乃有今日之龐大，差額頗大，其他項目因不得不緊縮，大多僅爲足以維持現狀之數目，此固非政府所願，但亦爲不得已使然。財部收入去歲約七萬億，今半年預算列五十八萬餘億，增加十倍以上，人民負担亦大為增加，歲出部份不足之百分之三十九，仍須由稅收與舉債解決，預算各項爲免受物價影響，多已放寬，然證諸過去經驗，即令如此，於執行時欲達預期月標，恐仍不易。</p>
<h3>改革幣制　首須穩定貨幣基礎</h3>
<p>至此，張氏談及幣制問題，渠稱：常國府主計處將預算提出國務會議時，曾附主要建議，即改革幣制，嚴管物資，穩定物價，安定民生，然後財政收入方可眞正確定，國民參政會亦曾促請政府提早改革幣制，社會輿論亦莫不作此主張，然分析目前局勢，一則戡亂動　，軍需浩繁，支出無法减少，一則共然到處破壊刧掠，生產萎縮，交通阻滯，物價飛揚，通貨膨脹，在此情况下，歲入項下五十八萬億之　措已極勉强，欲求財政收入確定，誠不可得，故基本問題在於如何建立使貨幣　趨穩定之基礎，然後方可從事整理或改革幣制，俾順利完成，並必期其繼續穩定，而安民生。此基本問題主要關鍵，在預算平衡或支出差額减少，至少亦必使歲入不致减少，爲此，上月底乃有十項改革財政經濟金融之辦法。辦法之第五項，即明列穩定幣値之目標，其前三項，於執行預算時，即可實施，其他或已實行，或正開始實行，藉此可收平定物價，安定民生之效。（各立委質詢情形刊左角特欄）</p>
<h3>全經會例會　經濟方案施辦法永利部份修正通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕全經會五日下午三時舉行第卅三次例會，張院長主席。首由　副秘書長毓瑔報吿過去一週內上海物價及滬·津·漢·一月份物價情形，並說明各地金融管理局成立後對金融市塲所發生之良好效果。據　氏稱：一月份津物價僅上漲百分之五，漢。滬物價亦上漲甚微。繼由經濟部長陳啓天報吿視察武漢經濟情形，並說明武漢之物價現較平穩，惟該地工商界以漢口之地位不亞於其他各地，而以往貸款爲數極少，故請求予以合理之待遇。繼即開始討論：　經濟改革方案實施辦法水利部份修正通過（此爲水利部重擬實施辦法提會討論者）。　經濟改革方案實施辦法交通部份原方案第四項港埠之經營等項實施辦法，亦修正通過。　經濟改革方案實施辦法金融財政部門，今已討論一部分，餘留下次會討論。茲悉經濟改革方案實施辦法可於下次會中全部討論完畢。</p>
<h3>台幣匯率又提高</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北五日電〕台灣銀行稱：自五日起，台幣匯率提高二元，即台幣一元折合法幣一〇四元。</p>
<h3>救濟特捐督導會在首都正式成立　目標十萬億只許成功不許失敗</h3>

<p>〔本報廣州五日電〕粤省沿海區域剿匪工作，自海陸軍配合進剿後，收效頗宏，橫行東莞·博羅一帶之劇盜吳束，已率所部投誠，刻已收編。先是匿居港方之李濟琛等所謂「國民黨革命委會」，以該匪聲勢頗大，曾派出「中執委」黃精一與吳聯絡，並委吳爲「民主聯軍東博縱隊司令」，吳投誠後，已將該「巾委」擒解虎門要塞司令部訊辦。此厥爲剿匪以來之最大收穫。又開平·合山等地淸剿奸匪，亦迭有斬獲，斃俘奸匪三百餘名。又粤北南雄股匪鄧文禮，亦率所部向該區淸剿司令葉　投誠。</p>
<p>〔中央社海口五日電〕我淸勦部隊，頃以巧妙攻勢挫毁奸匪盤據已久之所謂「民主基地」之南坤巢穴。</p>
<h3>通貨數字不擬公布預算赤字漸謀平衡　張院長兪財長答覆立委詢問</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕張羣院長五日在立法院例會中，說明本年上半年總預算情形後，立院各委員紛紛提出質詢或建議。</p>
<p>劉志平謂：預算歲人部門只見在平民身上徵收，未嘗顧及豪門巨富，並請對公敎人員生活指數三月調整一點有所說明。</p>
<p>靑年黨某立委謂，通貨發行達七十餘萬億，如何得了。</p>
<p>鍾天心謂：不僅預算歲入部門是老百姓負担，歲出部門不數赤字如靠發行平衡，結果物價高漲，亦是老百姓負担。渠並指出，渦渡政府與行憲政府不能脫節，無施政方針是一錯誤，全部預算嚴格說來，三分之二是爲使文武公敎人員不致餓死，三分之一是爲使此政府不關門，每無建設性質建議，政府計劃包括太多，應集中力量，作幾件事，改革幣制，吸回僑匯與增加豪富負担，爲當務之急，應下大決心，鼓大勇氣爲之。</p>
<p>孫九錄指出，歲收部份整頓稅收，應平均貧富負担，簡化機構，並隨時注意稅串應與物價平行，歲出部份，軍費最大，應採精兵主義，公敎人員待遇，應求安定生活，俾得養廉。</p>
<p>王　詢問海南島設洽，預算未會列入，是否因宋子文主粤又已取消原議。</p>
<p>簡貫三關心四十餘萬億赤字預算之彌補問題，謂如靠發行通貨，實太危險，至若僅靠舉外債平衡預算不足恃，亦不足訓，發行公債若非强迫認購，恐鮮效率，均經張院長，兪財長先後答覆，茲分誌要點如次：　預算歲收部份，全就國稅，關稅列舉，關稅率爲廿三年所訂已不盡合理，此外，鹽稅，直接稅等均已調整，至救濟特捐事，當由財部多硏究有效實施辦法。　公敎人員待遇，如依立院原建議計，年需二七五萬六千億，非政府所能負担，幾經硏究，始作現行決定。生活指數三月調整一次，誠不合理，然事實所限，如每月調整，技術及負担問題均不易解決，雖如此，政府亦願詳硏更妥善之方法，以維公敎人員生活。　去歲通貨發行數字，政府不擬公布，然傳說發行達七十餘萬億，絕非事實，即述七十餘萬億之一半亦不到，蓋截至前年底，通貨發行不過兩萬餘億，去歲歲收約十五萬億，歲出約四十餘萬億，而公債，救濟物資，敵僞產業等，均有補收入，以此度之，通貨發行實數如何，不言而喻。近共黨造謠宣傳去歲發行額在百萬億以上，當屬無稽。　海南鳥設治並未取消，然建省尙嫌過早，現海南島治安仍靠廣東省保安隊維持，建特別區事，當須稍待。　預算之赤字，須漸使平衡，非一蹴可成，其辦法當由財部詳硏，如單靠發行通貨，乃飲酖止渴而已。張氏末對各委員之注意力不斤斤於某項數字之增减，而在全盤問題之討論，深表感慰。並稱：決心實施其手訂之財政經濟金融改革辦法十項，逐步達成穩定幣値，安裕民生之目標。</p>
<h3>開展台省鋁工業　待政院核准後即可實行雷諾返美向總公司報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕雷諾銘業公司與我資委會合作開發台灣鋁工業事，此間資委會有資格人士已予證實，並謂確已商得初步結果。此項合作之方式有二：一爲投資，一爲美技術人員參加工作。至是否成立一中美銘業公司類似之機構，則尙未定。雷諾日前來京與我資委會負責人商洽後業已返美，將向該公司報吿在華商洽之結果。資委會亦將向政院呈　與該公司合作之計劃，俟核准後即可實行。又悉，現尙待商討者，爲如何保障此項合作產生優良效果問題。</p>
<h3>動用國外存款家涉禾獲效果　兪財長在立法院報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日常〕財長兪鴻鈞五日晨在立法院例會中對辦理動用國人在美存款事，報吿頗詳，據稱：財政·外交兩部以屢就此事提向英·美交涉，但兩國迄仍不願改變其態度，在美國者，以美國行政權力不能令銀行洩漏私人存戶秘密，各州法律亦異，加以傳統保障私人財產，其他如法國等亦曾有與我相同交涉，均無效果，美國仍堅持應由存款人本國政府命令存款人暫交國家運用，毫無轉寰餘地。至英國方面，英政府根本不允開予存款人名單，至鼓勵存戶申報，使國外財富內流之辦法，雖已擬定，並經政務會議通過，必俟外交獲得相當結果，方可順利執行，解決此久懸之問題。</p>
<h3>川陝聯防下月實行</h3>
<p>〔本報成都五日電〕陝省府秘書長林樹　昨來蓉，與鄧主席會談川陝議防事，對聯防剿匪作重要決定，下月實施聯防計劃．</p>

<p>〔本報漢口五日電〕白部長五日招特記者，報告戰况。</p>
<p>〔本報軍慶五日電〕行轅訊：羅匪一股頃自蕭家堰西竄馬良坪</p>
<h3>美國援華五億元說國各院未加否認</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕美國務院對報戰國務院建議五億一千萬援華計劃之訊不加否認，然同時亦不予承認。數星期來國務院對援華問題一直守口如瓶也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日準備再請國會核准撥付對外援助費十億元左右。據參委外交委員會委員喬治稱，此款將用以資助中國及支付日本，朝鮮與德　四國佔領費。喬治未言其詳，惟悉此類列在馬歇爾援歐復興計劃之外。馬歇爾本人亦稱，國務院正在考慮進行在軍事卜援助希臘。土耳其。</p>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺五日電〕馬尼刺晚報訊：外交界來自遠東委員會之消息稱，對日和會可能在三月間舉行。和會會址，雖未完全決定，然主張在珍珠港舉行者甚多。</p>
<h3>九龍城怪客　自稱佛門子弟要做居民代表</h3>

<h3>又一侵略計劃的開始！</h3>
<p>據合衆社四日倫敦電稱，戰後蘇聯第一次五年計劃，規定建築鐵路二千八百英里，通往中國東北邊境及外蒙之鐵路，達五條之多，其中有三條通往中國束北，一條與中長鐵路相通，其他二條，則與西伯利亞鐵路相聯接，至於蘇聯在外蒙邊境之鐵路建設計劃，其目的在與外蒙之公路運輸建設計劃相配合。合衆社發出這一條新聞，是依據蘇聯俄羅斯共和邦敎育部所發表的小册子，當然是千眞萬確不容疑義的事實。蘇聯對於外蒙及我國東北究底懷有何種野心，姑置勿論，僅就此一端而言，我們至少可以看出蘇聯在遠東將採取何種行動的意向。</p>
<p>第一，蘇聯在這次大戰中遭受納粹的侵略，其在歐洲的士地，大半爲德軍所佔領，不論是生產事業或是交通路錢，均遭德軍的破壞，損失之慘重，幾乎非數字所能表示。戰後蘇聯刻正從事復興工作，卽將實行第一次五年計劃，爲社會主義國家奠定一個鞏固的基礎，論理其建設重心，應在其歐洲方面，尤其是鐵路交通，好比是我們人類的大動脈，對於國家的復興及建設，有莫大的裨益；而今蘇聯的第一次五年計劃建設鐵路的中心，不在歐洲却在遠東，使人高深　測，不得不懷疑蘇聯特別重視遠東別有作用。同時我們放眼看看遠東的情形，蘇聯雖然也曾對日作戰，但是戰爭的火種並朱涎及西伯利亞，蘇聯在西伯利亞所有工業設備以及一切交通路錢，均能保持戰前的狀態，故在目前需要建築鐵路的稈度，遠不及其在默洲的領土，是非常顯而易見的。但是蘇聯爲什麽要把鐵路建設的重心從歐洲移至遠東？除了蘇聯對於我國東北另有企圖而外，實在找不出別種理由。</p>
<p>第二，戰後蘇聯對中國的行爲，例如搬走東北的工業設備，以其解除日軍武裝所得之軍備盡行供給中共弄兵作亂，將「鐵幕」籠罩外蒙及朝鮮北部暨拒絕將旅順大連交遝中國等等，無一不使中國人民對其「蘇聯是愛好和平」的理想發生懷疑。最近北大校長胡適發表其致周鯁生校長一函，亦率直指出：「蘇聯已變成一　可怕的侵略勢力」。我們看了胡氏的公開信，莫不憂懼蘇聯將取日本的地位而代之；今天又看到合衆社的報道，蘇聯第一次五年計劃要建築五條鐵路，直達我國的東北及外蒙，更覺得信而有徵。蘇聯企圖以鐵路來包圍我國北陲的野心，旣已暴露無遺，我們豈能再自我陶醉在「蘇聯是愛好和平」的夢想之中呢？</p>
<p>第三，蘇聯的鐵路建設計劃，目前尙未動工興建，雖不立卽構成嚴重的威脅，但是蘇聯處心積盧，先以鐵路來包圍我國的北陲，將來所能造成的後果，是値得我們　高警覺的，所謂「履霜堅冰至」，「一葉落而知秋」，我們不能不「未雨綢繆」，早爲之計，更不可不「杜漸防微」。何况我國遭受强鄰的侵略，心有餘悸，且飽　痛苦的經騐及血的　訓？日冠侵略我國的計劃，也是如此開始的，誠如田中曾奏稱：「欲征服中國，必先征服滿蒙」；其征服「滿蒙」也，亦是先從建設鐵路開始：其痛恨張作霖也，是因爲張氏在東北建築「南滿」平行錢。以此例彼，蘇聯企圖以鐵路包圍我國北陲，不能不認爲又一新侵略計劃的開始，而此一新計劃的侵略更將有甚於九一八與七七日寇之所爲！</p>
<p>第四，束北的危機，足以構成世界的亂源，本報社論曾一再喚起國人暨世界各國政治外交家的注意。最近美國飛虎將軍陳納德氏撰文在美國各報發表，也說「第三次世界大戰之火藥錢，現正在中國的東北燃燒；美國欲消除此種威脅，有待於中國的協助」。這並不是一種危言聳聽之辭，東北局勢確已危險萬分。從經濟的觀點而論，東北的工業設備被蘇搬走一空之後，只剩下了一個軀殼，非經五年十年的建設，恐不能恢復舊觀。舍經濟而言軍事，共匪仗恃了國際幫凶的奧援，在去年年之中，幾乎盤踞了整個的東北，爲攻佔瀋陽起見，並曾發動七次攻勢，雖均爲政府軍隊所擊退，目下吉長路的四週已沒有匪踪；但是在遼西的匪軍，仍用流竄的方式，向遼陽·新民·黑山·打虎山等地進擾，企圖截斷平　路的交通。共匪為什麽不惜償付任何代價一定要攻佔東北呢？這是因為「確保東北，鞏固華北」，原是共匪在軍事上的一貫策略，共欲勾結異族以遂　亡國滅種的毒計，是昭然若揭的·同時在另一方面，蘇聯拒不履行中蘇同盟友好條約，將旅顯大連移交中國，其用意也是一望而知的。日來我國軍事當局對於渤海洋面的動靜，已予以密切注視，且嚴禁外輪駛往大連。這種情勢的發展，正足說明東北的戰火在蔓延中，而且其含義，不僅僅是中國的內亂，實在可目爲具有國際性的前哨戰。美國　野聽了合衆　的報道，看看東北的情形，再　想將來的遠東，現今還能再熟視無睹嗎？</p>
<p>要之，蘇聯在遠東的野心已暴露無遺，欲以鐵路包圍我國的東北及外蒙，不過是蘇聯將在遠東有所行動的先聲而已；我們豈能束手待斃，聽其包圍乎？再察蘇聯此舉的作用不特在對付中國一國，而且懷有別種遠大的企圖，美國朝野卽不為遠東和平着想，也應該替本身利益打算，對於日趨嚴重的遠東局勢，豈可再袖手旁觀而聽其惡化乎？我們還記得當九一八時，我們指出日冠的野心在獨霸遠東，美國人並沒有多大理會；今天蘇聯旣已虎視眈眈，共匪又在中國作內應，美國友邦和中國人民豈還能把共匪的叛亂看作中國的內戰乎？</p>

<h3>駐滬美總領卡勃脫　綜論中美關係　為美對華政策有所闡明</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處本市訊〕美國總領事卡勃脫，今日在扶輪社發表演說，對中國方面關於美國政策之許多誤解，表示遺憾。卡氏之演說詞如下：</p>
<p>「自從我到這裏以來所獲得的許多深切印象中，大多數是可喜而令人神往的，但我們很抱歉地說，有一種印象特別使我充滿驚恐。鑒於中美之間業已存在數十年的友誼和諒解，鑒於你們的興論機關確然値得很高的敬意，這種印象使我驚奇更甚。我所說的，是指似乎存在於此間的對美國及其政策的種種誤解。</p>
<p>「在中國境内，有一種信念似乎流傳得很廣，就是說美國一方面在忽視中國，而另一方面却正在扶植日本，使它成爲東方防止共產主義蔓延的柱石。當然，中國人民不會忘記我們曾經捐贈十億美元以上的金錢和貨物來救濟中國人民以及恢復他們的經濟，而我們的救濟供應品正繼續源源不絕地流入中國。鑒於中國所遭受的十年破壞和痛苦以及在反抗日本的戰爭，中國是我們的盟友，英勇逾値，堅定不移，我們的重要政治家早已說得很明白，就是說，我們的目的是繼續以援助給予中國人民，唯一的問題乃是如何能使其有效地獲得實現。</p>
<p>「於是看看在日本的經過情形。我們已剝奪日本的艦隊，解散它的陸軍，拆卸它的軍火工業和軍事根據地，並且接收了散佈得很廣的許多島嶼，這個島嶼網，日本人曾經背信地用以攻擊珍珠港的。我們希望日本人將　加世界上思想和平的國家，爲全世界促進和平與改善生活狀况而努力，但是我們決不至於如此愚蠢，會在一個很早的日子把武器交還他們，須知我們是經過了冗長而代價浩大的許多戰爭歲月之後，才把日本人手中的武器打掉的。</p>
<p>「我發覺極流行的第二種誤解，就是說我們以援助給予別國，是爲自私的目的——我們這樣做，是將維持我們自己的繁榮。諸位，沒有一個國家會因爲把物資和它勞力的產物給予人家而致富的。美國的繁榮並不依賴這些，附予。相反的，我們給予別國的援助，意思就是美國每一個家庭所作的犧牲。由於我們把小麥·油類·鋼鐵和其他許多產品裝到國外去帮助沒有我們那樣幸運的國家，美國國內就缺乏這些產品，而在像我們這樣的自由經濟制度中，缺乏意思就是物價提高</p>
<p>「我想我們的中國友人應該瞭解，我們在做些什麼以及我們爲什麽要這樣做，這一點是很重要的。在國內，我們的援華計劃也正在遭受攻擊。美國有許多人希望把別國內發生的事情忘懷，而集中我們的力量於國內問題。有鑒於存在於世界如此許多部份的不幸情形依然存在以及爲校正這種情形而獲得的進步是如此遲　，令人失望，所以需要美國人民極大的堅定來繼續這種爲帮助別國而作的犧牲——爲了我們相對的安全以及爲了我們傳統上對於國外事務的疏忽，更應該如此做。對於認識世界各項問題的嚴重性而在努力使美國充份參與其事以謀解決的這些美國人，聽到了友好國家中不公允的批評是會感到失望的，因爲這種批評，僅足以使我們在國內的工作更爲困難而已。</p>
<p>「第三個在這個國家中很普遍的誤解，似乎以爲美國政策是由物資或帝國主義的動機所鼓動的。讓我們再來把記錄檢討一下：我們已解散了我們凱旋的軍隊，拆去了我們大部份的艦隊或放在後備隊去，拆毀我們一大部份的飛機，復負我們的戰爭工廠，改作和平的用途，並把我們的作戰部隊從實際上駐在外國每一個崗位上撤退回來·如果說我們正在計劃軍事的　險，我們會這樣做　？那些把我們當作帝國主義的人們，請注意例如最近我們在巴拿馬的行動。</p>
<p>「我們曾以數億萬元經由聯總援助某些國家，而這些國家現在反說我們威脅他們，不管人家說我們是經濟帝國主義，我們已化了數十億美元去恢復戰爭最受害國家的經濟生產力。我們現在正在考慮一個由歐洲各國而非我們自己所草擬的計劃，要我們再化數十億美元，去完成同樣的目標。</p>
<p>「有人疑心美國對合灣有所圖謀，我以爲這是矛盾的觀察，尤其從我們給予菲律濱以自由一事上看來，這種觀察實在是荒謬的，而這裏對於另一個外國帝國主義，却沒有多大的批評，這個外國帝國主義，實際上佔領着中國一部份的領土，輕視你們政府，並且經由那些攻擊它所認爲中國合法的政府的人們，把它的專制政體擴展到中國來，而自誇其成功。</p>
<p>「還有一點：有人爲了關於中國的協定而指摘美國，這些協定是羅斯福總統在雅爾達會議中勉强簽字的，然奇怪的是：美國爲了屈服在壓力之下而同意若干不利於中國的讓步，因而受人指摘，但當時對美國實施壓力而今日享用這些讓步的那個强國，反而沒有受到多大的指摘。而且，如果雅爾達協定獲得尊重的支持，而中國政府能恢復其全國各地的主櫂，那末情形豈不會比今日更好一些嗎？</p>
<p>「當我第一次聽到這些荒謬的誤解時，我不明白如何會有這樣的事情。我們忠於古老的友誼，對中國有過不少帮助，而且從無加害之事。這個所顯示的基本事實，在這裏已完全明白了。然而在我抵達上海後的兩天，數千學生爲了一件意外事件，（這件事並不牽涉美國）而舉行反美示威運動，並把反美的標語，塗寫建築物上面。學生的思想是以眞正爲受訓的目標的，怎麼竟會誤入歧途呢？</p>
<p>「於是我想到美國所流行的對華歪曲觀念。我想到被化爲大事的小事以及證明小事不確而很容易被人忽視的大事，我想到許多體面的人，他們相信關於中國的歪曲事實的說法，並誠意地把這種說法散播開來。我們在美國已發見一種小小的集團，裏面是一羣不忠於國家的人民，瘋狂似的設法推翻我們的國家和制度。他們能多次欺騙許多誠懇而聽敏的人民藉此散播他們有害的毒素，甚至沒有大會懷疑到它的來源。這輩外國專制主義的奴才，當然想要破壊中美兩國間的古老的友誼。也許這個專制主義國家的一班寵臣在中國也很忙碌。凡是相信自由國家爲共同利益而合作的人，必須常常謹防這種誹謗的謠言。這種謠言爲了惡意的目的而設法把誤會來代替國際的友誼。</p>
<p>「美國很希望將來有一天能把今日致力於解決外國問題的思想和精神來移轉到解決自已國內的問題。我們也期望有一天我們國內的人民能有更好的食物，更好衣着和更好的住居。我們相信憑着我們的精力和能九，我們必能達到目的，然而我們知道自由對於我們，較之物資的幸福更爲寳貴，我們相信世界其他各處人民也和我們抱同一的信念。正爲了這個原因，所以我們正在援助他人，使他們能抵住一種空前的暴政的滲入。我們的政策是　支持和平與自由，使每一個國家，不論大小，都能依照其全國的才能，自由搬定其國家的命運」。</p>

<h3>克萊將軍再論　西德行政改革</h3>

<h3>日內閣瀕於崩潰　追加預算案遭左翼頑强反對　為妥協計政府決定撤回</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京五日電〕日本內閣特別會議今日決定撤回現行之追加預算案，藉以重加修正。此案由於社已黨左翼份子頑强之反對，已使片山內閣瀕於崩潰之境，政府撤回　案之目的，顯然在謀與社民黨左翼份子妥協，並阻止內閣現在面臨之連續危機。</p>
<p>〔路透社東京五日電〕社會民主黨左右翼發生之裂後，片山內閣之崩潰已迫在眉睫，該黨於昨日下午開會後，左翼黨員決定撤銷對社會民主黨聯合內閣之支持，同時內閣第二大黨中間將綫之民主黨，最近亦已揚言將與反對黨自由黨（保守份子）採取同一陣錢，故片山內閣之辭職，殆已不能避免。朝日新聞今日之社評，認爲政府與社會民主黨左　份子就發給公務員津貼之預算而發生之衝突，可能引起國會之解散，或片山內閣之辭職。</p>
<h3>赫爾回憶錄　北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室譯　白宮中盛大和平大會流產</h3>
<p>一九三七年十月五日，羅斯福總統在芝加哥發表他著名的「隔離演說」。自從他受職以來，羅斯福先生一直在爲恢復國內的正常情形而拼命掙扎，結果他有時候無法充份注意我們外交方面的事務。在我，則對美國國內孤立主義情緒的滋長愈來愈担憂，此種情緒，可於許多和平組織的活動，信件，請願書和民意測驗見之。我對於這些事實在國外各國可能發生的影響，也非常憂慮。九月間，我知道總統擬提早作橫越大陸到太平洋的旅行。於是我就和戴維斯商量，並且表示堅決的意見，認爲總統應該在他的旅途中，發表一篇有關國際合作的演說，特別應該在一個孤立主義根深蒂固的大城發表。因此我就帶戴維斯一同去訪問總統，並且我們向他提出了這個意見。他當即表示同意。他說，假如我們預先爲他準備演說的必要材料，他會在旅途中加以發表的。</p>
<p>我們回到了國務院，並且用初稿的形式準備了這篇演說。在我們的草稿中，並沒有這個著名的「隔離」字句。總統本人負責把這個字句挿進去，因爲在他發表道篇演說之前，曾加以最後的修飾。我並不知道其中有這樣一個字句，直到他講了之後才知道。</p>
<p>總統說，「百分之九十的世界民衆的和平，自由和安全，正被其餘的百分之十所危害，後者正以破壞國際秩序與法律相威脅。當然，希望在法律之下遵照許多世紀來幾乎爲全世界普遍接受的道德標準而生活的百分之九十民衆，能够並且必須找出一個方法，以謀貫澈他們的意志……</p>
<p>「世界上無法無紀的疫病正在蔓延，這固然不幸，但是似乎是準確的。當人體上的一種流行病開始蔓延的時候，民間社會贊成並且會同意把病人隔離起來，藉以保護整個社會的健康，防止疾病的蔓延。」</p>
<p>對於隔離觀念的反應，是迅速而激烈的。據我看來，它對於我們爲培養和增强輿論傾向國際合作而不斷進行的敎育運動，至少有使它倒退六個月的影響。我們中間負責在任何可能情形之下經由演說，聲明和行動來推動這個運動的人，努力工作，竭盡所能，但是我們又一直謹愼，不要走得過遠，深恐孤立份子的猛烈進攻，反而使我們倒退過原來的地位。假如我們逐漸進行，不去激起不必要的反對，那麽我們的說話和行動，雖然並不能像我們希望的那樣有力或者影響深遠，但是對世界而言，可以有更大的效果；反之，假如我們發表驚人的聲明或者採取急劇的行動，倒反而會爲了我們所引起的激烈反對，而把國內木身就是分裂的這種景象，呈露在世界之前。</p>
<p>六個主要的和平組織發表了一個宣言，聲稱總統「指引美國民衆走向通往世界大戰之路。」美國勞工聯合會通過決議，聲言「美國勞工不頗離沙搬洲或者亞洲的戰爭」。衆　員費許和了克漢以要求彈劾鏟統相威脅。費　「　詢」報以電報　　國會意見，結果顯示二價以上對一個是反對和國際聯盟採取共同行動　付遠東問　的。民間並且發動一　運動，要二千五百萬人簽字在一個「防止美國牽入戰爭」的請願書上。</p>
<p>所有這些反應，當然紛　一時，在希特勒，　索里尼和日本軍閥　來是悅耳的。這無　使侵略國家更大胆，而使歐洲民主國家懷疑我們除了在言語上和它們站在一起之外，是否再有其他。日本更大胆的行動即隨之而來，而以二個日後日本飛機炸沉美國砲艦「潘南」號而達最高峯。</p>
<p>一九三七年十月這個月中，副國務卿韋爾斯想起了一個世界和平計劃的念頭。他擬就了一個很長的備忘錄，親自跨過街去給總統。他要總統在十一月十一日歐戰和平紀念日召集駐華盛頓的所有外交代表在白宮舉行一個盛大的會議。就在那裏，總統要發表一個戲劇性的呼籲，要求各國共同在會議桌旁坐下，擬定和平的基礎。總統將就這些基礎提出一個大綱。其一是就國際行爲的原則獲致協議；另一是栽减軍備；第三是經濟穩定。他將提出一個結論，就是除非轉取和平政策，和平不可能維持多久。</p>
<p>幾乎在我曉得這件事之前，我發覺總統已經完全贊同這個計劃了。在白宮上演這樣一個有聲有色的節目，對他很有意味。幾年來，他早就想邀請各國的首長，同他在海上舉行一次會議。在一艘戰艦或者巡洋艦上的圓桌周圍，他將和他們擬訂一個持久和平方案。他沒有達到提出正式建議的程度，但是他曾經試探過幾個人。有關他這種思想的說話於是就傳佈開來，可是反應並不見得太好。駐羅馬大使費里普在第一次覲見墨索里尼之後，於一九三六年十月九日寫信給我說：「顯然的，羅沙（義駐美大使）曾和他（墨索里尼）講過總統希望會晤歐洲各國首長的意思。他談及這件事時，微微地笑了一下，未作肯定的表示，對我露齒而獰笑，並且聳了聳肩」。</p>
<p>我個人覺得像總統所設想的這　會鑽，結果將　一　損失，要想靠圍坐在桌子之旁一兩天互相商談而就和各國政府商定複離的辦法，是不可能的。就為了這個理由，別國政府贊於這個觀念不　歡迎。它們知道總統不能成立秘密協定，而秘密協定或許是這種大西洋中的會議所能產生的擭有的協定。</p>
<p>類似韋爾斯所設想的東西，曾由　意志銀行總裁沙赫特於一九三七年一月二十日向戴　斯（Joseph　B.Davis）大使提出，當時戴氏正道經柏林前往莫斯科。　　斯打電報給我說，沙赫特曾經吿訴他，說他已由希特勒授權向法國和英國提出建議，藉以保障歐洲和平，固定現行疆界，裁减軍備，成立一個可以發揮效能的國際聯盟的新形式，耶消裁制並且替德國獲得殖民地。他說法國表示贊同，英國則否。</p>
<p>沙赫特於是說，他希望總統能够在華盛頓召集一個國際會議。當戴維斯表示除非有若干成功保證總統可能不願意牽涉這種　情時，沙赫特回答說，除非事前確已獲致協議，會議不應召開。會議不應稱爲「經濟會議」而應稱爲「和平大會」。</p>
<p>當我發覺總統一意準備在白宮中舉行歐戰和平紀念日會議時，我懇切地反對這個計劇，認爲它是不合邏輯的和不可能的。我就我所看到的情勢，槪要地講給總統聽。在一九三七年的後期，德國，日本和義大利已經加緊武裝到如此程度，這種行動，無疑是以進攻爲目的，不是以防衛爲目的，是以征服爲目的，不是以和平爲目的的。正當民主國家應以最大努力來武裝自己以供自衛的時候，來一個和平大會使它們留戀在一種安寗的感覺之下，實屬危險之極。我看到軍事侵略的危險已有幾年，現在似乎更迫近了。所以，由和平國家發動一個新運動以謀單在它們自身之中更進一步裁减軍備，而軸心國則繼續瘋狂進行武裝，似乎完全不切實際的。任何消息靈通一點的人都知道在五年之中，每一種勞力都曾做過，謀使軸心國家參加裁减軍備協定，但是它們故意拒絕，並且以　大規模重振軍備。軸心國家對於和平國家這種失之過遲的裁减軍備要求，是會大笑不止的。</p>
<p>從使協定獲致了，又有什麽價値呢？所有三個軸心國　已屢次表示不　它們所作的諾言以及鄙視條約。「條約」這兩個字，已經或為希特勒，　　里尼和日本人的不値一提的東西和笑柄。軸心國對他所作呼　的反應如何，總統已有所認識。　索里尼曾經回答說，在動員了一百萬人費去了二十　里拉之後，他　直一定要侵略阿比西尼亞，不然他的威　將掃地，他將招致其他國家的鄙視了。他的確反映他軸心伙伴的情緒的。它們也已動員了數百萬人，費去了數十億馬克和日圓，它們是要拿可以拿的東西的。</p>
<p>爾斯的多少有些眩耀性質的計劃，將在歐戰和平紀念日出現，事前並沒有和其他國家商量或者試探它們的意見。最低限度，不先徵詢一下英國和法國的意見，似乎是不聰明和不公允的。那時候，它們正在和德國及義國進行微妙的談判；它們正設法使西班牙不干涉委員會繼讀存在，發揮功能。所以，突然間把如此誇炫的一個計劃向他們提出，事前又朱曾有所警吿，可能使它們非常難堪。</p>
<p>一九三七年六月，當時在倫敦的戴維斯試探出張伯倫首相可能訪問華盛頓，來會晤總統。羅斯福先生願意發出請東，但是認爲張伯倫最好在九月間國會休會之後再來，他並且認爲在訪問之前，外交上應先作愼重的準備。</p>
<p>張伯倫在七月八日寫信給戴維斯，戴維斯把信轉給總統和我，其中說他必須拒絕在秋季和總統舉行會議的觀念。他說他並不以爲時機已經成熟。假如一個必然會引起極大注意的會議而不能產生完美的結果，影響之嚴重沒有更厲害的。目能，他並不認爲我們可以達成預期的目的。</p>
<p>此在東方，日本已明白表示它不願西方來調解中日關係。它出席和平大會以謀獲致任何重要協議的可能性，是非常渺小的。</p>
<p>在我和總統就此一題目所進行的幾次談話中，他並不接受我所提出的見解。最後這個計劃被放棄了，於是我們就繼續我們的努力去重振軍備，並且促使與論方面理解世界烽火即將燃起的嚴重危險。</p>

<h3>圈佔已地審議發還　全部還者有兩起　江灣區七百畝由聯勤部徵收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院在滬中央機關使用敵僞圈佔民地審職委員會第一組，於昨日下午三時在地政局召開第一次審査會，審議在滬軍　機關及交通機關使用民地之案件十二起，出席海軍基地司令部，交通部，房地產業同業公會，市政府，國防部，港口司令部，中央信託局，空軍供應司令部，律師公會各代表。由小組召集人馬少基及地政局長祝平主持會議。審議原則多數認爲在巿區內之土地使用價値高，應儘量發還。各使用機關除實際需用土地得依法辦理征收外，其餘儘可能發還原地主。如使用機關之性質確實重要，則依法全部辦理征收。十二案審議結果，部份發還者五起，全部發還者二起，案情重要提請大會討論者四起，全部征收者一起。</p>
<p>其中全部發還之二起，爲：　聯勤總司令部兵工署第六十兵工廠使用敵僞圈佔法華區內民地約十畝。　聯動總司令部交通器材儲運所供應迎第一庫使用敵僞圈佔閘北區內民地約五畝。全部辦理征收之一起，爲聯勤總司令部第一汽車裝備製造廠使用敵偽圈佔江灣區內民地約七百畝，該廠規模爲全國汽車裝備製造廠中之最大者，事實上現已在辦理征收手續。</p>
<h3>兩航空公司明日起漲價　各錢約增百分卅至四十</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國及中央兩航空公司航空客運票價業已呈奉交通部核准，定於七日起再度漲價，上漲成數各綫分別自百分之三十五至四十不等。滬港錢及昆港錢因有外匯支出故增加百分之四十，平瀋綫因加强疏運東北旅客，僅增百分之三十，其餘各綫大都均增百分之三十五。中航公司總經理劉敬宣昨語記者稱：本年以來，飛機用汽油已三度上漲，計增加百分之四十七，每加侖約需美金六角，但如美國國內各航空公司所用汽油　加侖僅需二角九分。外匯牌價月餘來亦已提高兩次，計增加百分之三十四，公司方面外匯支出因而增加。此外最近發表生活指數亦較上月上升百分之四十，公司員工之薪資支出亦大爲激增。在此種種情形之下，航空票價每次皆不能及時比照調整，致損失甚巨。又如中國航空公司上月復奉命往寗夏等地開航，地帶偏遠，載運情形不佳，且汽油皆係專機運去，而票價與內地完全一致，於公司財政尤爲不利。故兩公司最近特派員携同資料數字晋京，向交通部詳細解釋後，始獲允准加價。</p>

<h3>東北的恐怖</h3>
<p>〔本報灌陽三日航訊〕王豪君在安東收復時期做過聯保主任，潛居匪區兩年，頃自安東匪區脫險抵潛，爲記者縷述匪區見聞，由安東一角，可知匪在東北，如洪水猛獸，爲害日甚，然其威逼　從，挾衆聚亂之伎倆，及一切殘暴行爲，勢不容於束北民衆，而自取滅亡，此由一葉，可以知秋矣。</p>
<p>匪軍活動</p>
<p>匪軍行動，　忽無定，流竄擾亂，聚散無常，故其兵力多寡，主力所在，無從捕捉，匪你所至，即與當地人民　雜，民衆　其淫威，敢怒而不敢言。匪軍到處擴兵，手段毒辣異常，每至一村，即以村幹部政工人員，强迫組織基幹隊，村有基幹隊，區有區大隊，縣有縣大隊，十八歲至四十五歲者，均須服役，美其名曰「參軍」，就地訓練後，即趨赴前綫。</p>
<p>匪軍之糧秣被服，均取之於民間，其在匪區，按戶口搜括　糧，十分澈底，每人須納糧七十斤或百斤，無一定次數，按籍索取，違者處死。匪在安專設有五個民衆被服廠，係强征私人成衣局糾成，幷利用僞東洋紡織工廠及東亞膠皮工廠出產之棉布膠皮，但原料甚感缺乏，不少匪軍士兵冬着軍鞋。匪軍</p>
<p>武器奇缺</p>
<p>新兵只發給手榴彈數枚，步槍子彈均不超過六十發。王君在脫險途中所見，安　綫下馬塘及通遠堡匪較多，僅配備　砲六門，山砲十餘門而已。</p>
<p>匪之訓練，以政治爲主，精神講話是重要科目，揑　種種謠言，汚蔑政府，汚蔑國軍，說中央無官不貪，無吏不汚，文官括民財，武官喝兵血，又說國民黨是封建勢力的大本營，打倒封建勢力，必須先打倒國民黨，打倒國民黨就是打倒官僚資本，富翁，地主，自耕農均是封建餘毒，都該打倒。他又呌匪軍士兵帶起假面具，討好民衆，他說：人民出錢養軍，民衆是爸爸，八路是民衆的兒子。</p>
<p>政治活動</p>
<p>匪亦有行政組織，省有主席，副主席，政委。縣有縣長，副縣長，政委。區有區長，副區長，指導員。村有村長，副村長，閭長，大組長，小組長，十戶爲閭，三閭爲一大組，五家爲一小組，以小組爲單位，實施迎坐法。匪軍在城市及農村均利用　種組織，以爲馭民之術，城市中有工會，農會，均係窮人組成；在農村中有兒童幽，婦女會等，爲軍政情報之傳遞工具。</p>
<p>匪在農村中活動積極，暴行最著，其目的無非欲致農村經濟破產，富者變窮，窮者變匪，擴大亂源，舉其暴行數端，可見一般：</p>
<p>淸算鬥爭</p>
<p>積極進行，即打倒富人，窮人翻身，造成血腥恐怖，致富人於死，使窮人爲用。其淸算方法，頗饒趣味，先由窮人檢舉某人，再授意區村幹部及大小組長，召開民衆大會，如檢舉某地主的十歲兒子，在某年某月某日打死某窮人一隻鷄的罪行，由這一隻鷄，一年可以生多少蛋，多少蛋一年，可以生多少鷄，多少鷄又能生多少蛋，如此計算下去，到十年或廿年，地主的若干田地，頃刻即爲算淸，簽押之後，趕出村去，稍有遲疑難免　棒打死。</p>
<p>追浮挖根</p>
<p>此種毒手在鏟除地主，以防其反鬥爭，將其田產房屋均分以後，再迫究浮有和私藏，追浮者，即迫地主獻出所有衣吻器皿，挖根者，即迫其獻出私藏財物，務期於盡，然後在其項下掛一個地主或惡惡地主牌子，使其討飯無門，活活餓死。</p>
<p>污辱仇視</p>
<p>凡在中央機關做事人員或在國軍服役官兵之家屬，即在其門口懸掛一個白布長方的燈籠，寫上「土匪家族」四字，下邊畫一列棺材。</p>
<p>支前保田</p>
<p>窮人分到田地，須，　婁兵支援前錢，保護田地，一旦國軍進入，則視為支援不力，不但田地不保，性命亦不能保，匪之殘暴，窮富均不免。</p>
<p>割去尾巴</p>
<p>加入匪團的民衆，日間要工作，夜間要「坦白」，如某人說話與窮人不同，便是頭腦沒打通，輕的禁閉，重則暴打（名曰帮助）他須反省，經過多次坦白，而後願「割尾巴」（抛開一切顧慮）肯「放包袱」（獻其所有）才能身免於難，准加入匪。</p>
<p>奴才隊</p>
<p>年在四十五歲以上的老頭和地主的幼年子弟，組織爲代耕隊，耕種參軍窮人分得的田地，而不收報酬，名曰「奴才隊」。（記者趙展）</p>

<h3>何玉書談江蘇糧政</h3>
<p>〔本報　江三日訊〕征糧是戡亂期中的一大要政。江蘇的糧政情形如何，頗為各關懷，省田糧處長何　書於上年九月間接任，十月十五日起就開征卅六年度的征糧工作，這一　艱難的担子，當他就任的那一天就對記者說，我必定要遵照中央的意旨在軍精民食統籌兼顧下竭力的做。</p>
<p>到今天爲止，江蘇的征糧工作，進行將近四月，大江南北的全盤收數已在六成以上，現在該處正派大批人員出動赴各縣坐催，務必如限如期征足。</p>
<p>征實征幣一瞥</p>
<p>征實的縣份計共廿九縣，爲江寗，句容，溧水，鎭江，丹陽，高淳，金壇，溧陽，宜興，武進，江陰，無錫，常熟，吳縣，吳江，崑山，靑浦，金山，松江，揚中，泰縣，江都，儀征，六合，江浦，高郵，興化，實應，淮安，征幣的縣份為太倉，嘉定，寶山，川沙，南匯，上海，奉賢，啓東，崇明，海門，南通，如皋，靖江，泰興，東台等十五縣，按江蘇計共六十三縣市，除了以上征幣征實的四十四縣外，其餘都因水災匪災過重免征，據何處長語記者稱：去年中央規定的征率，是征一借一，照原賦額每元征實四斗四升代征公糧三成，共爲九斗二升，後因江蘇淪陷最早，人民受災亦重，又减爲照原賦征四折，計每元征實三斗征借一斗代征公糧九升，合計四斗九升，今年呢經過省參議會的建議及中央的體卹計征實一斗二升，征借六升，代征公糧四成，計四升八合，合計每元實征二斗二升八合，另收積穀一升二合，兩計二斗四升，本省三十六年度全部征實額計共爲五百九十五萬五千五百七十七石九斗。</p>
<p>一番苦心整理</p>
<p>江蘇淪陷時期最久，故一切舊有賦册，均大半散失無存，經決定　發動基層工作，按保逐甲，挨戶査問，重行編造田賦底册，以便有所依據。　按照自然地形，分段按地問主，再編總歸戶册。聽說各縣征糧都有附加，是否合法呢？據何處長稱：按照中央法令是不准再以土地為對象，而作捐稅之來源，後來省府感覺到各縣縣財政困難重重，乃擬訂變通辦法，並經商准省參會通過，始暫准附加，但其附加所得必須用之於（一）百年樹人之國民敎育，（二）防止奸匪之強化地方自　工作，（三）杜絕攤派之後的地方自治等工作。</p>
<p>擊破三求政策</p>
<p>收購縣級賦　，縣級財政是賦穀爲主，過去數月間因中央均不能按照市價收購，　致　財政困難無法解決，現在經過各縣參議會的建議，中央對地方財政困難亦深洞悉，故今後決定按照市價收購，同時並以市價收購糧食，此固爲中央育實民食軍糧之最大原則，而且又可使接近匪區糧食得以購運　安全地區，粉碎共匪三求政策之一的求食之迷夢。</p>
<p>軍糧如期征撥</p>
<p>按照中央的規定，自卅六年十月份起至卅七年八月止，計應征撥軍糧一百廿五萬八千大包，至日前止，已配撥四個月，計撥送四十三萬大包，中央以本省軍糧均能如期征撥，曾傳令嘉獎。</p>
<p>展開掃糧運動</p>
<p>卅六年度田糧，已經該處令飭各縣催征掃解，以期年度結束（傘七年六月）前，能收全部出賦掃數征足，但自征兵工作開展後，各縣有移轉重心，忽視征糧的情形，現省府已通令各縣　　對　征糧征兵，同為動員戰亂中兩大要政，應該兼籌並　，一面省田糧處洪副處長將巡廻各縣舉行掃糧運動，按保逐甲挨戶騐串，限期售征淸楚。（本報記者和香林）</p>

<h3>吉安棉墾塲　棉·麥·稻作　收相當成效</h3>
<p>〔本報鄱陽一日訊〕戰時敵人的鐵騎踏進入江西門戶後，本省出產棉花最多的湖口，彭澤，九江，瑞昌，永修等縣先後放棄，這時負有改進棉作的永修棉塲，也隨之停止工作。農業院鑒於棉作生產，關係軍民的衣食問題，有積極增產的必要。在民二十七年八月中旬，遂籌設吉安棉麥塲一所，經半載的勘地，圈購，整理，始吿成立，開辦時，塲內有職員十五人，農夫，七八十人，每年經常費，只有一萬七千餘元，三十年由該塲余主任請求增加經費，擴充塲地七百餘畝。</p>
<p>該塲所種小麥，多採自安徽南宿州優良種子，分發南城，上饒，弋陽，永新，萬安，贛縣，臨川等縣試驗，栽培結果，每畝產量，增加目二斗二升至五升，棉種採自廣西桂林美棉，常德鐵籽棉及本塲馴化脫字棉，並特約上饒，貴溪各縣農塲繁殖良種，近又試種雲南開遠木棉和福建龍岩木棉，均有相當成效。</p>
<p>塲中棉作試驗，佔地最多，其次稻田，還有一部特用作物試驗地。全部新闢的塲地，因土壤尙未墾熟，棉株植料，雖難充份發育，但結鈴尙多。稻田多種「鄱陽早」，結實纍纍，收穫甚豐。此外特用作物菸葉，除蟲菊，薄荷，篦麻，都長得特別茂盛。</p>
<p>現在棉作，佔地一百六七十畝，試驗項目，有二十餘種，內分純系育種，栽培試驗。麥作，經過考種，產量分析，均已成功。早稻有三十餘品種，其他篦麻，玉米，大豆，粟，高梁，均分區培植。塲的設施佈置，多具庭園化，農具機械化，管理技術化，以期達到成爲本省標準農塲，作爲示範。</p>

<h3>保證每一學生　不受失學威脅　市敎局李局長昨表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局對於下學期學費標準，迄未決定。昨據李局長熙謀稱稱：在此物價波動劇烈之情况下，劃一之學費標準殊難訂定，各校設施情形；學生成份，及家長之負担能力，各有不同。敎育局目前所努力者，爲保證每一學生不受失學威脅，同時使長期處於經費困難中之學校及敎師，得有較佳之境况，以增加設備，從事進修，改進師資等等。故下學期各校學費之征收，原則上將使具有負担能力之家長負担稍重，而同時嚴格執行市參議會所規定之免費學額百分之廿五。一般學校祗能將免費額提高至規定之免費額之上，不能在百分之廿五以下。任何學校，不得因學費面拒收學生。如學校因免費生超出限額而無法負担時，得由校方開具名單，由市敎育局於獎學金等項內撥款補助之。上述辦法澈底執行後，全市中小學免費生可達八九萬人，佔總數五分之一。即使學費提高，但任何淸寒學生仍均可免失學威脅。</p>

<h3>大專淸寒生　昨招待記者　盼擴大獎學金名額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各大專淸寒學生，昨日下午三時假淸寒同學會，聯合招待記者，據稱：物價高漲，下學期學費數字騶增，政府當局雖有統一獎學金之設置，惟以名額有限，僅能解決部份失學危機，懇切請求政府當局擴大獎學金名額。渠等就目前不完全之調査，估計六十個中學，需要獎學金救濟之學生五，二八五人，每名以四百萬元計，需款二百一十二億元；十七個大專學校，需要獎學金救濟之學生四，八五九人，每名以五百萬計，需款二百四十三億元，共計需款四百五十五億元，如將來米價上漲，尙不止此數，此與本市獎學金統一審核委員會預定捐募一百五十億元之數，相差懸殊。渠等復稱：各校原設之助學金，刻已停止活動，且知學生本身自行募捐困難，而爲激亦徵，無濟於事，故唯一希望當局者，即在擴大獎學金名額。</p>

<h3>現代籃球速度太高　美國有人主張修改　恢復中圈跳球可以慢一些　世運選拔賽美探用舊規則</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約四日電〕世運籃球淘汰選拔賽，就要在紐約舉行，迷哥兒對選拔賽，分外注意，因爲它的吸引力，是兩方面的：第一，選拔賽可以決定世界運動會的冠軍隊；第二多時不見的中圈跳球，在選拔賽中重行出現。</p>
<p>如有一個國家，能在世界運動會中打敗美國的籃球隊，這該是籃球史上，空前的大冷門。所以三月三十一日晚上，紐約馬迪森公園球賽上的美國入選隊，也該是全世界的錦標隊。</p>
<p>今年世運會　採肜老規則</p>
<p>因爲戰爭的緣故，別國籃球的發展，大受影響，今年世運會還是採用一九三五年的老規則，便宜了歐洲各國。美國在戰爭爆發前不久，就已修正舊規則，取消中圈跳球，規定進攻的球隊，不准在後塲躭擱十秒鐘以上，任何球員站立在本籃前鎖鑰地區內，不准超過三秒鐘，這幾條規則，在今年世運會中，一律不通過。</p>
<p>美國現在的戰術，是只攻不守，長島大學敎練皮克萊，因此主張恢復中圈跳球，打起來可以慢一些，他的主張有何效力，倒要看這次世運選拔賽了。對美國籃球的流弊看不慣的，不止　古萊一人，他們不滿意的地方很多，好像每塲比賽的比數，動不動就是八十五比七十，速度高得頭頸都要折斷，和對身高六呎五到七呎的球員，特別看重諸項，名裁判兼約翰馬歇爾大學敎練貝哥維區，肯色斯大學的亞倫博士，無綫電體育廣播員勃朗脫，和紅極一時的球員華契德，都曾主張修改球規。</p>
<p>巨無覇長人　籃下太便宜</p>
<p>貝哥維區和勃朗脫提議，籃下拍進只好算一分，以免巨無覇式的長人獲分太多。貝哥維區還贊成每進一球，雙方再在中圈跳球，至少出界球在擲入比賽前，須經渦裁判的手。他還提出一種「暫緩鳴笛」法，耍是一個球員空擋竄進對方，故意侵入犯規，但球仍入籃，應該算他得分。要是一射不中，那時再鳴笛，宣佈對方犯規。</p>
<p>亞倫預備規定：射籃改作爲死球論，免得別人跟進拍入，並且他主張恢復由圈跳球，由五個人輪流跳球。華契脫主張籃圈和檔板間的距離，應為二十吋，並且要比現在再高五吋，這樣一來拍的機曾比例减少，况且還可以鼓　準確射籃。</p>
<p>美國的籃球比數，一年比一年高，球員也一年比一年高，現在重要的大學籃球隊中至少有一個球員身長六呎七吋以上，因此上面的理論，就不絕人口了。</p>
<p>但是一九四八年的世運選拔賽，和舊式比賽，却是對能緩慢比賽方式的首次試騐，所以敎練們和球還異口同聲，都說用這方法淘汰出席世運會的籃球隊，重要非凡。</p>

<h3>輸出品製造原料輸入辦法　輸管今日公佈實施　准予输入之原料可分兩類</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出入管理委員會於本日公佈「輸出品製造原料輸入辦法」，據經辦該辦法之輸出推廣處負貨人發表談話如次：</p>
<p>我國手工業產品及輕工業產品，例如草帽刺繡品塘磁器皿熱水瓶等，過去外銷頗目成續。又我國新興工業之產品，例如紗管電氣器材等，亦極具外銷希望。但此類產品之製造，大多需要國外原料。年來因輸入原料有限，各業產品僅敷國內需要，輸出頗受影響。本會茲爲協助製造廠商，於經常限額外，獲取較多之原料，獎勵此稱製成品之出口，俾收爭取市塲，充裕外匯之效，爰訂定「輸出品製造原料輸人辦法」。該辦法業經呈奉行政院核准公佈實施，至根據此項辦法准予輸入之原料，可分兩類，第一類原料輸入後，製成之貨物，應全部輸出。其目的在扶植基礎業已鞏固之出口工業，例如製帽用之金絲草及蔴草，即其一例。此類原料准予輸入後，可在不影響國內物資供應之情况下，協助廠商推廣外銷，爭取外匯，並攱勵若干農村手工副業之發展。此類原料製成品出口所結售之外匯，根據本辦法規定，最低不得少於輸入原料所需外匯之二倍半。又其輸入原料之數量，限於製造若干數量之輸出品直接需用者。第二類原料輸入之目的有二：一，爲擴展出口市場，二，爲協助工廠增加生產。質言之，即在使各工廠獲得限額外之原料，俾增加其產量，以其增產所得之一部輸出，換取外匯，以支付原料輸入所需之外匯。另外一部，則留供國內市塲需要，俾收充裕物資之效。但此類原料製成品之種類盛多，現正商討每種原料輸入價値，與其製成成品後，應行結售外匯價値間之比例。</p>
<p>廠商應用本辦法，申請輸入原料時，關於結匯問題，可有兩種辦法。一，凡廠商有存貨者，可於此項貨品出口之前，來會申請其所需原料，待貨品出口時，即以其出口所得外匯一部抵付此後輸入原料所需之外匯。但結購進口外匯與結售輸出品外匯間之比例，仍應按照本辦法規定辦理。二，凡廠商無存貨者，而其原料製成之成品國外確有銷路者，則可於結購原料進口外匯時，同額之遠期出口外匯結售指定銀行。至其差額，則可於貨物裝運出口時，按照本辦法第三條之規定陸續結售。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕又據輸出推廣處負責人表示：一，按照「輸出品製造原料輸入辦法」第一章第三條及第四條之規定，關於甲乙丙類原料之種類，及乙類原料製成品輸出所得外匯，及原料所需外匯，數額間之比例，應由本曾會商經濟部後，列表公佈。現爲廣徵各業實情計，凡輸出輕工業或手工業製成品者，其所需國外原料，均可來會依照本辦法規定申請，俟申請後，再由本處隨時會商經濟部，予以規定，俾免事後發生</p>
<p>二，本辦法第一章第七條規定申請者，應另向輸出推廣處進行登記，現不訂定登記限期，即在申請者第一次來會申請時，同時辦理登記，以求便捷。惟仍盼有關各業同業公會於本辦法公佈後，即先行擬具製成品輸出及原料輸入詳細具體計劃送處，俟各項計劃業經原則商定後，再由各廠商分別遞送申請書，俾免往返週折，以利進行云。</p>

<h3>論針藥殺人之原因</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>我害在某報撰文數千字，暢論針　殺人之原因及其防止方法。惜該報銷路甚劣，不爲人所注意，如今針　殺人（？）之傳說又甚　　上，誠可慨也。茲因事實上之需要，特再撰短文論之。</p>
<p>德國之藥物學專家葛特呂普氏間當有言，「世問之藥品均非絕對　人之藥物，任何藥物在人身內可以成爲殺人之利器。」旨哉斯言！吾人若能細味其言而推論之，則所謂藥物殺人與夫針藥殺人者，可以思過半矣。</p>
<p>原夫藥物之不用內服而改由針管注射者無非因病者之腸胃旣已入於生病狀態，其腸胃之吸收能力當然因之大减，是故改用針管注射，以求其藥力發作之迅速耳。（例如一切之救急藥）且藥物之中往往有因內服時非常刺激腸胃，發生嘔吐或胃呆，而改用針管注射，則甚少刺激者（例如內服之Euphyllpn甚傷腸胃，若改用針劑注射於肌肉內，則除有少許刺痛外，別無其他痛苦）是以此種藥物必須製成注射劑方可應用。至於腸胃部份發生外傷或癌腫或其他發炎病症而不能輸進食物與水份時，則爲維持病者之生命起見，尤須借助於針藥之運用以求保持其營養，（例如生理食鹽水以及葡萄糖液之類）斯固無需筆者之贅述矣。</p>
<p>雖然，藥物入體，如或運　不當，則成毒物反爲大害，上文亦已述及。而况藥力發作迅速之注射劑哉？是故舉凡可供注射之藥物，不論毒力之大小與夫份量之多寡，皆須於製成注射劑前加以詳密之化學性檢查藥學性試驗，以及生物學方面之實驗；於製成注射劑後又經過嚴格之消毒手續，方可應市出售。此則凡屬製藥廠商類皆明應斯百，無庸喋喋者。顧我國之西藥廠商因資本之缺少，設備之簡陋，以及人才之缺乏關係，遂致其中有不無柤製濫造者。設若以此種不成熟之藥品供人注射，則其不僨事者，吾未之信也，</p>
<p>抑吾又有論者。盛藥之物咸以玻璃爲之。玻璃之原料爲矽酸與鉀鈉鈣之類，其中尤以硼酸及小蘇打爲用最多。假如調配不得其宜，則所成之玻璃或則太多酸質或則太多鹼質。嗣後若以含有酸性之藥物裝於太多鹼質之玻璃管內（Ampulte），則其內之酸性藥物將因玻璃內所含之鹼質而發生變化，久而久之，成爲於人有　之藥物。反之，若以含有鹼性之藥物裝於酸性之玻　管內則其藥性之變質亦然。是故舶來藥品之能久貯不壞者，胥由於盛藥玻璃之能保持其中性耳（Neutral）。方今世上出售之注射藥品不特粗製濫造，即其盛藥之玻璃小管亦菲薄至於不堪手指之一彈。若爲醫者於注射藥物之前，未曾嚴密審查其何處出品，以及藥物有無變色，溶涉是否沉澱抑或渾濁，玻璃管上有無小小破裂之罅隙等等，而貿然爲病人注射，則其不僨事者，吾不之信也。（詞人謝啼紅先生曾有文誌其注射葡萄糖鈣及維他命BC十餘針後，忽然發生反應幾死之事實。又新聞報嚴獨鶴先生之公子亦有類是之情形。予則以爲若藥物之不宜於注射者，則一針之後立起反應，何必相待至注射十餘針後，方始有之？是可知其必爲玻璃管內已有罅隙，藥物因此變質，醫者不加細察，貿然爲之注射所致耳）</p>
<p>前已言及藥物之不宜於其人者，入體即成毒物。是以醫者爲入治病，不特隨時須要斟酌病情，方可開方給藥，即其藥物入體之後，可能發生之種種反應亦須再三注意。例如患有心臟病者，吾人知其必須內服或注射强心藥矣。然而同是强心之藥，何以此藥可以注射而他藥不可注射，何以此藥今天可以注射而明天絕對不可注射。凡此種種玄奧，若非熟悉生理病理以及藥理等等學間而兼有多年之經驗者，不能知之也。方今世亂年荒，一切失其常軌。其有黠而詐者，輒復捨正路而不由，　緣求得證書一紙，即以之懸壺問世。方其以現成進物治愈少數病人，即以此沾沾自喜，儼然擠身醫林，放言不慚。其不憤事者，未之有也。</p>
<p>苟子有言：「戰戰兢兢，如臨深淵，如履薄冰。」吾人行醫滬市，爲人診病，莫不兢兢自守。蓋知醫學無止境，病症多變化，苟不審愼周詳，則轉瞬間即可發生不幸事件。方今醫師不爲人重，動　爲人以法院起訴相恫嚇，几我醫者，對於病人之診治，藥物之選擇，以及注射　物之事前檢驗，事後觀察，尤須再三汴意，方可求其倖免。否則　者雖然自問無愧於心，而衆口鑠金反爾竣生種種麻煩。可不愼歟？</p>
<p>時有友人詢予以日前報載肌肉注射維他命B，殞命之故。予答以維他命B素是否可以殺人，日前尙無確切之定論。雖曾見世界各國文獻有注射維他命B素後發生反應之記載數起，但在　理方面尙無充份之證明。蓋其致死之因素甚多，未必即以此致命。且病者所受注射之　物是否爲維他命B素，抑爲其他藥物，予不之知，常然不能　爾判斷。至若謂其於注射維他命B素後，針方拔出即刻臉色大變者，予則以爲乃係「休克」所致，蓋病者之身體旣已衰弱，而心臟又有病症，則其一刺之後因痛覺而激動　走神經之反射作用，促使心跳突然停止，遂致因以不救耳。予曾於數年前　上海小姐謝家驊女士注射防疫針，方其一針刺入，立即昏厥，其母在側　　萬狀，予吿以「此係休克無庸焦慮」，於是爲其注射樟腦溶液，未及半分時問，即已恢復原狀，謂其爲强心藥之功，吾不之信。蓋其心臟康健，經若干時間之後，雖有迷走神經抑止心跳之反射作用，亦可自動回復常態也。雖然，謝女士之心臟如或巳有病症者，則吾殆矣。一笑！</p>
<h3>療瘡與硫磺中毒</h3>
<p>— 王爵榮</p>
<p>疥瘡——一種極易傳染而又非常難受的皮膚病——在內地流行得很厲害，患者最大的痛苦，是在更深夜半，被窩裏睡熱的時候，患處非常的癢，因為後，不得不抓，但是越抓越攁，越癢越抓，如此常常半夜不眠。雖然是不很重要的皮膚病，但是因爲牠影響睡眠，使患者精神方而非常痛苦，所以莫不急於求治！</p>
<p>疥瘡有沒有特效藥呢？「有」！那就是大家都知道的「硫磺　　」，尤其是大名鼎鼎的「滅疥」（油或膏）</p>
<p>「滅疥」能否眞正滅「疥」呢？能！確實能！但是因爲一部份患者用得過量，或者少數患者的皮　對硫磺有特別的「敏感性」，於是用了「滅疥」，疥尙未滅，而「硫磺中毒」却不幸的降臨到患者的身上！</p>
<p>筆者不是「皮膚科專家」，但是三年前，第二個小女不幸從鄰居的小孩方面傳染得了疥瘡，我於是用很少量的滅疥油每天晚上給她擦在患處一次，擦了兩天，每天早上並代她洗浴，第三天手灣處和腿灣處各發出了十餘粒丘疹，非常的餐，個人以爲疥疳未愈，第三天晚上仍舊照擦「滅疥油」（因爲我曾關照她連擦三天），第四天不對了！孩子的面部和四肢腫了起來，小便量减少，而癢處加　！</p>
<p>當我晚上回去看見了這種現象，我知道一定是「藥物中毒」了！但是看看「滅疥油」的瓶十，眞正用了一點點！還不該是用得過量，大槪是這孩子對「硫磺製劑」有「過敏性」吧！（過去她只需注射極少量消治龍，半小時後也會週身發出紅疹，關於這點，在下次另有專篇叙述）</p>
<p>除了立刻停止使用「滅疥」外，因爲在小便　找到很多蛋白質，於是想盡方法來解毒，和急治這因藥物中毒而起的「急性腎臟炎」，經過了兩個星期的治療，中毒現象才漸漸消失，而腎臟炎却變成了慢性，又經過了三個月的藥物和飲食治療，她的病才眞痊正愈！這是第一次我發現患者對硫磺油膏的渦敏性！</p>
<p>幾個月以後，在新年的假期中，我到金壇去有事，因爲勝利不久，丹陽到金壞的公咚橋樑被破壞，長途汽車停駛，我於是恢復了上古時代的交通工具，乘了獨輪車出發，上車時車夫爲了掜攬生意，包我下午五時趕到金壇！（上車時才上午十時），那知到下午四點半，才走了一半的路，到了耶陵鎭，車夫吒露眞言，說天色將晚，不能前進，不得已我祗好借宿耶陵！這鎭上也有兩萬人口，但是並無旅舍，商量了一小時，才得到燒餅店老板同意，讓我們住在他店裏的擱樓上，小樓高僅三尺，我們（還有一位吳君）抱着「大丈夫能屈能伸」的精神，借宿高樓，樓上並不「家徒四壁」，除了牆上貼有幾張月份牌以外，米桶，醋罐，油瓶，醬缸，便桶，尿壶四面皆是！承居停好意，讓出被褥，（我們未帶行李），可是找看了他手上的疥瘀，實在不敢拜領，那天正是一月二日，天氣的冷，不下今天（一月廿七日寫稿日）我蓋了大衣，勉强假寐於草褥上，因爲旅途勞頓，竟然入睡，吳君未能「深得吾心」，好意代我蓋上「錦被」，等我南柯夢回，目睹之下，這一急非同小可，但是友情溫暖，盛意可感，焉能見怪！第二天，到了金　，連忙洗澡更衣，辦完工作趕回上海，而身上似乎已有一二粒小疹，急不擇醫，請了自已，靈機一動，計上心頭，找出了小女剩下的滅疥油，在癢處擦上一點，明天更癢，再擦一點，後天手　腿　處也發出了大量丘疹，其癢無比！筆者　於小女前車之鑒，連忙停止滅疥，可是頭部，足部和陰囊都已浮腫，那天確巧母校　安堃敎授來舍，常即請敎，初時　敎授也不能立即診斷，經我說明曾用少量「滅疥」，並吿以小女中毒經過，彼方診斷亦爲「硫磺中毒」！在此期間，我找遍了皮膚科和藥物學書籍，找不出硫磺中毒的詳細叙述和治療方法！</p>
<p>常時我最感特異的，是兩手灣和兩腿灣部之丘疹，大小如綠荳，一陣一陣的癢，實在難當！頸部癢處除浮腫外，發出如雲頭狀之風疹塊，尤　陰囊水腫，最感不便，那天正是在華府飯店請中致富兄吃飯，臨時不得不換了中裝，後來經過六針「自血」六針鈣劑的注射，中毒現象才漸漸减退，在這兩星期中小便中有微量蛋白質和很重的硫磺味！</p>
<p>六個月以後，爲了要實騐這皮膚的敏感性，我特地（爲了硏究的興趣）又在手背上擦了一些硫磺油膏，迎擦兩次，第四天手　腿濕處又開始發現丘疹！因爲是、在夏天，我對這丘疹細細硏究，發覺和上次者並無不同。我這目我「臨床實騐」終於吿成！（這裏我附帶聲明，在一個醫師自己生渦某一種病時，他對這病的經過更能了解！神農　嚐百草的精神値得我們欽佩）！</p>
<p>此後三年中，我對這病特別注意，遇見了至少三十幾個病例，大多數是因爲對疥瘡急於求愈，於是　藥過量而發生硫磺中毒現象，中毒初期，因丘疹之癢。自以為疥瘡未愈，再加　劑，於是火上加油，雪上加霜，　毒更深矣！</p>
<p>三十餘人中、中毒較深者均覺肛門部及陰　奇癢！最深者三人週身浮腫，出水，且體溫驟增，小便减少，中毒現象减退後，貽有慢性腎臟炎者亦不乏人！倖無因中毒而致命者一</p>
<p>最近因事赴京，寓舍親處，其子十三歲，前亦患疥瘡，因以硫磺水洗浴次數過多，而開始中毒，手灣已發現丘疹，頸部亦有風疹塊，醫者斷爲普通之風疹，一面其母以以爲疥瘡天愈，仍代其以硫磺水洗浴，並塗滅疥，余無意中與之交談，發覺滅疥氣息，詢之，始發現其有中毒現象，因吿以經驗，囑即停止硫磺浴，果然未兩星期中毒現象减退！返滬途中，思及各地同病者定不乏人，因寫此文，為同病者告，倘亦相憐之意云爾！</p>
<h3>肺結核的防禦</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>呼吸傳染：由空氣中呼吸而傳染。此在肺發牛結核最多，由呼吸而來。肺結核多爲吸入性傳染，如塵埃中附有結核菌，傳入後而形成結核病灶。此種傳染利害而且常見，普通均十分難於預防與管理。此稱呼吸吸入性傳染，通常有兩種情形：</p>
<p>（一）塵埃傳染：含有結核菌的痰液，吐到地上，乾燥以後，隨塵埃飛揚，他人吸入肺內，即遭感染。空氣流動，太陽光强則較好。患者病室內之塵埃，亦有傳染之可能與危險。因此有稱之爲住宅病或家族病者。但若在曠野則此痰傳染不易。由日光消毒作用，傳染危險較少。</p>
<p>（二）飛沫傳染：患者於談話，咳嗽，或噴　時，如用力過猛，即可噴出多量飛沫於空中。此種飛沫，多含有結核稈菌。尋常較大之飛沫，可噴至二三尺以外之範圍。由口噴出之結核桿菌活動力甚强，毒性亦大，傳染劇烈而容易。可直達於他人之粘膜，或間接由食物，手指，及其他帶菌物入口。故生活於渦份擁擠以及空氣不淸潔流通之地，均易傳染。</p>
<p>胎盤傳染：結核病的胎盤傳染，雖有種種報吿，要亦極端稀有。至於結核桿菌與精虫相混，以入於卵細胞，更不能證明。但亦間有由於胎盤感染結核病，致病菌逸入胎兒血液循環而起。並非由母體卵細胞含菌而遺及子體也。此種有接由母體胎盤傳染</p>
<p>自家接種：有肺結核病人，其痰可由外傷部份而於他處發生結核。如喉頭結核，皮膚結核。亦有由自家呑食結核性痰液，發生腸結核。此皆爲自家接種。他如泌尿生殖轉移，由血行續發者亦易發現。</p>
<p>肺結核的早期症狀</p>
<p>結核病都是由一種結核菌侵入人體，危害身體組織。而身體發生一種自衛的反應，不容這外物生存在體內。圍着這些結核菌成一個小核，把它包圍起來，最後變成石粒。所以這個小核就是結核病的起點，也就是癆病。這也便是科學醫學上稱結核病的由來。這種致病的細菌，便因此而稱為結核菌了。結核病的病原旣是細茵，自然它是一種傳染病。凡得這種病的全是染了結核桿菌，權遇到抵抗力强大的人，或是侵入的結核桿菌數目較少，或是因爲不是甚毒烈的種類，則不至爲害。反之，則受其害。甚至腐塊深刻化，蔓延他處，不可收拾，致病者於死亡。普通人體幾無處不可受其害，而肺部則爲最常被侵害之器官。結核病早期患者，多無顯著症狀，故甚少自知有病而於早期就診求治者。迨至症狀顯明，病勢已重，多已不可救藥矣：</p>
<p>肺結核病不是不可治的病。初期患者如能善爲療養，十分之八九可獲全治。然在初期，最易被人忽視。所謂初期，以病患最初發生時期。此時並無顯著症狀，患者或感有咳嗽，午後微熟，疲怠。雖疑心爲感冒，或慢性癮疾，神經衰弱。因此一誤再誤，殆病勢嚴重，根深蒂固，已難醫治。（未完）</p>

<h3>燭臺在那裏？</h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>新約馬太福音五章十五節云：</p>
<p>「人點燈不能放在斗底下，是放在燈台上，就照亮一家的人。」</p>
<p>這話我覺得很有意思，中國也何嘗沒有一樣的話：「我願君王心，化作光明燭，不照綺羅筵，遍照逃亡屋」。不就是「醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉」，一詩的結句嗎？可是詩雖是這麽說，作起來却不容易，老實講照着綺羅筵，究竟比逃亡屋舒服些，而且也可以免掉若干責任感。消極地說，魏晉人就講過：「膏火自前熬，多才爲患害」，大約照得別人的流亡苦痛與否，且不必說，自己先要焚身，却是大觸中國君子「明哲保身」之大忌的。</p>
<p>火的發明，眞是一段慘痛的歷史，這也就象徵着光明之不易取得。西洋神話裏的普羅米修士Prometheus因偷火至人間而被囚幽，莫非以涵育萬有爲志的萬能之神也不願意人類有了光和熱嗎？還是認爲光和熱是神的專有品，紳的法寳，人若搶了去，可能弄掉神的飯盌呢？這可眞難於猜測。中國的祝融氏造火，似乎也曾有過戰爭。不知耶穌的系統與希臘的神人相去幾何，能够說出這樣通達的話，無怪乎成爲人類敬奉的偶象。</p>
<p>即以純粹的燈而論，你莫非就不相信有放在斗下面的嗎？我記得在中學讀書時就有人用棉被堵了窗口，點着油燈推牌九，把訓育主任瞞得鐵桶相似。世界上光明固然需要「光」，黑暗却也需要「光」呀。這樣說來，就不能說凡是燭台都有用，問題還是點在那裏。</p>
<p>紅樓夢中怡紅院的小姐們常說：「我們寶玉是個丈八燈台，照的見旁人，照不見自已」。這本不是一句好話，猶言明於責人，而昧於罪已。然而若斷章取義，則照見旁人，照不見自已，正是一個了不起的犧牲，亦即前面聖經所說的「就照亮了一家的人」也。這是一種菩薩委身飼餓虎的精神，李義山詩說「臘炬成灰淚始乾」，雖然乃是比作愛情，事實上作了臘炬，不能不為自已的犧牲流淚，因之想到上海流行那句駡人的話，豈眞以爲人犧牲為十三點耶？</p>
<p>人是有理性的動物或人爲萬物之靈一類的話，很早我就認爲應該打一折扣了，鹿相呼以食，魚相煦以沬，這是人類最缺乏的精神。有一天我在公共汽車站看見那種擠來擠去的樣子，曾加以慨　，朋友笑起來說：「你不耍以爲人多會擠，即使只有兩個人解作同樣的理由，所以，一談到飯盌，當然要攘臂怒目的爭個不已，甚至發動自已的力量來打個　花流水了。——能够公開作競爭，　如選舉之類，也還罷了，更有一些人是用落井下石的方式的，那就格外不如魚和鹿了。</p>
<p>人們因爲現實的燭台都是埋在斗下面的，需要的洞燭幽隱旣無以達到目的，於是只好把希望寄托於神話，什麼秦鏡高懸，什麼燃犀照怪，總是想着有一把聖火，或一面不染塵埃的寳鏡，照出那些龍龜蛇神的面孔來，即使沒有周處下了水，殺個一亁二凈，至少亦可以知所趨避。如此說來，這些神話與詩篇，豈不是老百姓血淚的結晶？</p>
<h3>天才與病態</h3>
<p>— 紀穆</p>
<p>史上有許多天才都是病態的，但是另有若干天才却具有健全的體魄。有人曾經解釋過天才染有病態的原因說，由於他們工作過度所致。他們的神經系統，動脈管和　　，往往操勞太甚。</p>
<p>據　美書藉的記載，如作曲家曉邦，詩人濟慈和作家史蒂文生等，都是癆擦型的才子。前二人不幸夭折，史蒂文生則在世較久。假使他們在生前能够醫愈宿疾，是否就寫不出第一流的傑作，當然誰也不敢遽下斷語，不過在主張天才必患有畸疾的人看來，年輕人如欲實現他的天才夢，第一步似須沾染肺病！</p>
<p>我們提起病態的天才，自然忘不了英國的司各德與拜崙兩大詩人。他們是同時代的人物，均在兒時患了嬰兒性麻痺症，終生迄未治愈。司各德病在右腿，拜崙則病在左腿。</p>
<p>拜崙左腿的脚踝骨，萎弱無能，一經用力，他的脚便屈了轉來。但是他却是一個運動健將，嗜好游泳和騎馬。他在平日遝動的時間很多，力求使他的身體不致「發胖」，以致碍及他修美的儀表。</p>
<p>至於司各德的一對脚踝骨，尙見壯健，不過他的右腿比左腿短去若干吋。他也是一位游泳家和好外戶外運動的人。他外出騎馬的時間，也許比拜崙花得更多。他們兩人最大的不同處，就在於性格各別。司各德天性樂觀，慷概好友，而且愛說笑話。拜崙却鬱鬱寡歡，玩世不恭。他歡喜嘲弄世人，也許種因於他的病　吧。司各德氏雖然和他同病，但是並不輕易發脾氣。假使我們說幷崘　的跛腿，是使他成名的原因，那末，司各德的行動，與常人無異，又如何解釋呢？事實上，兩人同享盛譽，即使他們沒有身體上的缺獻，他們的著作，也是永垂不朽的。</p>
<p>臨末，英國伊里莎白女　功業　炳，身患異疾，也是一個歷史上的悶葫蘆。她是一個不平凡的女人，又是一個卓越的統治者。她雖然很希望找到一位如意郞君，生男育女，却終生朱嫁，常然想高　的大有人在呢。</p>
<p>據史學家的考據，伊里莎白女皇受她父親亨利八世的遺傳，患了某種不治之症。另據女皇去世後十五年，即一千六百十九年一天黃昏，有一位喚做貝喬生的，在他朋友屈萊蒙特家中吐露的秘密，說女皇生有不可告人的「異稟」，某法國醫生擬替她用手術割除，女皇躊躇未決，而這位醫生却先她去世了。</p>
<p>總之，天才與病態，頗有聯帶關擊，究竟何者是因，何者是果，似頗難說，天才有因放蕩不　，或縱情擊色而致病的，也有如我國太史公輩，病廢之後，才潛心寫作的。二者的關係，完全因人而異呢。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第十章自願犧牲　（六四）</p>
<p>當毓如到綺紈家裏訪問，正是小王媽出來開門，見是一個老頭子，要見綺紈，聞她姓什麽，毓如拿出一張名片來，吿訴小王媽道：「我是徐渚　家裏人，你去回一聲，你老板就知道了。」小王媽一聽是渚齊家裏人，向毓如看了兩眼，也就猜出十有八九是渚齊的父親，急忙忙拿着名片趕進去，吿訴綺紈，並低低說道：「我看那位老頭子，大概就是徐先生的老太爺。」說時，含着懷疑眼光，看着綺紈。綺紈一看名片，不由暗吃一驚，私忖渚齋父親親來找我爲什麽事，大概渚齋和家裏已講明白，所以老人家今天特來看我，但是渚齋專先何以沒吿訴我呢！今天又沒同來？但是老人家旣來了，總須　禮接待，想着，便對小王媽道：「請吧！」繼而一想，上年記的老人，都是　勤儉樸素的，第一次見面，須給他一個好印象，我穿這一身睡衣見他，他一定不喜歡，於是又把小王媽呌回道：「你請他到客廳，我換一換衣服就來。」便走到更衣室，把拖鞋脫下，換上皮鞋，又揀了一件灰色呢旗袍披上，才到客室，一見毓如，很恭敬的，深深鞠躬，　由小不媽手裏，接過茶忠，雙手敬茶，又敬香烟，自己只站在旁邊，不敢坐下，完全以晚輩之禮自居。毓如向她上下一打量，見面目長得很聰敏，渾身樸素，見人循規蹈矩，教禮甚恭，完全是一個關秀態度，出於意外。讓她坐，她執意不坐，於是說道：「我今天來這裏，有幾句話，和你商量，你請坐下吧。」綺紈才在下首一張椅十，側着傘身坐下。毓如今著滿面笑容道：「我就聽過，你是一位名門關秀，知書織禮，今天見面，果然名不虛傳！總算是渚齋有眼力。」綺紈乍聽毓如讀她是名門閏秀，心專又驚又喜，繼又聽毓如說總算是渚齋有眼力……便含羞脈脈低下頭去，以爲以下便要提到婚姻問題。在他們老人家，無非說些居家勤儉，沒有財產等等，心裏已打定主意，無論老人說如何過否日子，我無不答應，如此一來，他就高興了。綺紈心裏，正滿打如意算盤，不想接着毓如又嘆了一口氣。綺紈急抬頭一看，祗見他一手撚着　下　子，兩眼注在她臉上，搖一搖頭道：「可惜！可惜１」</p>

<p>夜色蒼茫中，走過鬧市。</p>
<p>抬頭間，我望了望上弦的月亮。寒夜的月雖然淸澈，但是在這車水馬龍的街頭，却決無讓你欣賞的餘地，把目光從月亮上移下來，就移到像平空獻着似的四個大字禮義廉恥上。突然，一陣淡淡的烟，蕩漾在這閃閃發光的字間，仔細一瞧，原來是國際大飯店頂上冒着的煤烟。這時侯，極目四望，閃爍的霓紅，喧嚷的人聲，眞是好一幅「天下太平」岡也。</p>
<p>偶而一想，想起日前報載限制用戶用電，和不少工廠，因電力公司近來為應用電爐水汀日多而負荷過重，因之不得不停止生產的故事。不由觸景生情，向着這矗立全市黑色巨怪的喘息，起了一陣誰都會引起的感想，這感想旣是誰都會引起的，那當然也母庸筆之於文，以免浪費此寳貴的篇幅了。</p>
<p>但是我想如果我沒有這麽「偶而一想」可多好，昇平之世，人烟稠密，水汀電炬，使冬天變成春天，使墨儀恢復光明，一連串美好的字眼，給道討厭的「偶而一想」，便都想出毛病和矛盾來，成爲醜惡不堪的了。舞塲裏燈紅酒綠，偶而一想便想着路旁凍屍，新年新春鑼鼓喧天，偶而一想又想到欠着未還的債務，安坐汽車飛馳大街，偶而一想却想到過橋推諸葛的張飛們……</p>
<p>曾經有一次，我決定從此不想了，即使是那麼偶然的一想。「糊涂是福」，這時代尤其如此。然而誰都有過失眠的經驗，失眠的人愈是要想入睡，愈是覺得淸醒，我這「戒想」的情形，恰正如失眠人想入睡一般，愈想不想，愈想得多，最後幾乎是胡思亂想，幻想夢想，東想西想，想入非非，竟想到我爲什麽要想的問題上來。偶而一想倒還可以漠然處之，一連的問題要找答案，可眞苦煞我了。</p>
<p>世界上到現在還沒有絕對自由的地方和事情，只有想才是天賦給人永遠受不着侵犯的自由，儘管禁止不准，限令遵照，而想卻是自由自在，無所拘束。身在囹圄的囚犯，什麽自由都給剝奪了，而想的自由却決不會喪失。處身於槍林彈雨中，儘可想着太平盛世；應對於上流社會裏，儘可想着男盜女娼；反正想只有自已知道，縱然不准思想，但是我想什麽，你又有何證據可以證明我想得不對？所以要防止一切都容易，却永遠防止不了人們的想。</p>
<p>然而想固然是天賦人人的權利和自由，人卻並不能人人都適當運用它，有人根本不曾想到他有想的自由，每天早上起來，三餐飯，一杯茶，跟着他人的行動而行動，爲着他人行動而行動，什麼都不想，不，想是想的，想怎樣今天多睡一個鐘點的覺。有些人的確很善於思想，但是想的是怎樣去把他人的東西變爲自己的東西，把他人的財產作爲自己的財產。羅斯福想怎樣組織聯合國，東條英機想怎樣發動珍珠港偷襲，同一想也，想的結果却截然不同。</p>
<p>這樣一想，我倒珍惜起我的這份天賦的自由來，並且覺得有些戰戰兢兢，不敢妄想，又不敢不想，因爲不想我怕變爲行尸走肉的酒囊飯袋，妄想怕變成瘋子罪人。而怎樣使所想恰如其份，和怎樣使所想付之於行，正是我永遠渴想解答的問題。</p>

<h3>黑人相輕</h3>
<p>— 津津</p>
<p>我國文壇上，有一句成語，喚做「文人相輕」，若干年前嘗被時髦的雜文家拈爲寫諷刺短文的題材。人與人之間的感情，就是這樣的離奇，無論在血統上，職業上，關係愈近，則妒忌心愈重，敵視的程度也愈深。所謂「忤逆」「　牆」等不幸事件，終是在一個家庭中鬧出來的。</p>
<p>我在類似的心境下，讀到了「黑人相輕」這一會事。</p>
<p>且說在二次大戰中，各地的軍隊調動頻繁，以前絕少有見面機會的美國黑人與法屬西蘭尼斯黑人，却在北非州會師。西蘭尼斯黑人很妒嫉美國黑人，因爲後者的配備及給養較法國軍隊爲優，同時他們又很看不起他們的「同胞」，自以爲隸屬赴前錢作戰的部隊，地位較高，而美國黑人則大半在戰地後方服務。西蘭尼斯黑人藐視他們的另一原因是：他們自稱係從「自由人」一脈相傳的後裔。反之，美國黑人，却是奴隸的子孫。</p>
<p>再者，西蘭尼斯黑人能說流利的法語，頗以文化水準高人一等自詡。某次，有一個西蘭尼斯黑人兵在跟兩個法國老百姓閑談。有一個美國黑人兵闖了過來，用破碎的法文，跟他們招呼。西蘭尼斯黑人輕蔑的對他看了一眼，轉身聳聳肩對法國人說：「你們看，這裏來了一個未開化的變子！</p>
<h3>老閻及其舊部諸將</h3>
<p>— 雪守</p>
<p>上月二十八日由報五版登載閻老將（錫山）的半身像，還是三十七年前那個神氣，多了些白鬍而已。他原是傅將軍（作義）的舊長官。傅氏自被命華北五省剿匪總司今後，保定。張垣各綏靖公署即已撤消，山西雖在五省之數，老閻的綏靖主任，仍然存在，五省之「晋」只作「晋北」解釋，此在政府爲優待元老，在傳氏爲尊敬老帥，都是很合理的。</p>
<p>老閻不但是傅將軍的老帥。亦不但是華北各將領的老前輩，而且是紀元前一年的「山西都督」，與湖北的黎元洪，四川的尹昌衡，是同時的第一班都督。彼時各省革命軍政府用「都督」古名以示異於淸政府之「總督巡撫」，後老袁時代改爲「將軍」，及老段當國，又改爲「督軍」，黎曹各任又有「督理」「督辦」之名，故「都督」只革命至民元之短期有之。許多都督早已做了古人，而今只　下一個老閻，可稱都督之「碩果」。</p>
<p>由今日回想到二十餘年前之曹錕張作霖，乃至王占元，李純，吳佩孚等等，有的做過「大總統」，「大元帥」，有的做過「巡閱使」，「上將軍」，而今都已長眠地下十年二十年之久，其實，論軍資都是老　的後輩。老閻做督的時候，曹錕張作霖王占元僅止師長。吳佩孚在曹錕部下由團長而待升旅長。至於馮玉祥不過一營長階級，與閻老督地位相差甚遠。</p>
<p>近二十年以閻馮聯稱，造因於民十五年之參加國民革命軍，其時「三張」負固一隅，抵抗北伐（三張者，老張為張作霖，中張為張宗昌，小張為張學良）。馮與老張早已翻臉，閻則老張所極力拉攏，不料閻已效順於國府，且遣傅作義，提孤軍直搗幽燕，佔據涿州，一方面進攻察哈爾張家口。老張一怒要用綠氣砲，閻電結作霖，稱爲「張雨帥」，暗示否認其自建之「大元帥」。老張覆電否認綠氣砲之事，電文中自稱「本大元帥」，而老閻仍然不理那一套。十七年北伐成功，閻馮各領一方面軍，遂有「幷轡」之勢。十九年汪精衛在北平玩了一套「擴大會議」，閻馮二將又凑合了些武的塲面，因此人們對二將的印象，彷彿「楊家將」之「焦不離孟，孟不離焦」。</p>
<p>可是，現在二人早已分道揚鐮，老閻依然保守住他那四十年的老地盤（三晉雲山），這又是老將獨有的紀錄。不但民元的老都督們皆已骨朽，即後輩軍帥，誰亦不能永在一省，長鎭鄕邦，不難覆按而知，惟老閻之「督資」，老閻之領山西，都是與衆不同的歷史。因爲「閻不離晋，晋不離閻」，所以北人提及，輙稱爲「地道無比的閻老西兒」（舊都習慣呼山東人爲老東，山西人爲老西，閻以晋人領晋四十年之久，　老而又老之老西也）。</p>
<p>所　歷的地　比　多，　遵命皆不長，陝，豫，甘，察，西北，山東，督軍，督辦，都做過了，升轉遷調，流水一般，而今流轉新大陸，與閻之老於一地，恰相反映。馮氏，自民國十三年奉直大戰，倒戈回到舊都，囚曹錕，驅　儀，風頭十足。吳佩孚却被他扯下臺去，因之老眞對馮惡感最深，寗與夙敵張作霖携手而打老馮。張作霖在第二次奉直戰爭，雖得馮力，打倒曹錕，但不久與之翻臉，有十四年之國奉大戰。（馮部自稱國民軍。）馮在北方，不但沒有老地盤，而且沒有一個長久的朋友。</p>
<p>閻馮部下將材不少，閻部尤盛，近年多已歸入國軍，直接中央，為國効力，掃盡從前車閥各系的色彩，實爲軍界的大進步，好現象。</p>
<p>老閻舊部最出色者，當然是現任華北五省剿匪總司令　將軍，鼎鼎大名，成績昭著，一身擔負北地重任，儼然萬里長城。再則徐永昌將軍，曾於勝利之初，代表中國，前往日本會同麥帥及盟國將共同受降，目覩日方重光　梅津氏之俯首簽約，完成重大而光榮的使命。又如商靈將軍，與徐將軍迭任晋冀主席，外應使節，發揚國威，女武兼資，　歷中外，都是不多得的人材。至於老馮舊部，惟孫連仲抗戰期內，擔任十一戰區，卓著戰績，近兩年之河北主席及綏靖主任，則表現無多，今已調職首都，蓋其前勞足紀也。此外如宋哲元，張自忠諸人，亦早已脫離私系，公忠報國，盡瘁身亡。以現在而言，馮之舊部凋零盡矣。（一月三十一寫於舊都）</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Decides to Return the First Half-Year's General Budget Bill for Review; Postal and Telecommunications Price Increase Approved with Supplementary Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Legislative Yuan discussed the general budget bill at its regular meeting on the 5th and decided to return it to the joint committee of five committees for review, with specific suggestions, for discussion at the general meeting on the 12th. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan discussed the Executive Yuan's proposal to supplement the legislative procedure for the postal and telecommunications price increase. The members agreed that the Executive Yuan's illegal conduct should be corrected and resolved to approve the measure, but with a statement that future postal and telecommunications price increases must be handled according to procedures and not be arbitrarily changed. Finally, the proposal submitted by Liu Zhiping (see separate article) was amended and passed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Legislative Yuan held its first regular meeting after resuming sessions this year on the morning of the 5th to discuss the national general budget for the first half of the 37th year. President Sun Ke presided, with Xu Kan, Director of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics, Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan, and Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun in attendance. First, Liu Ke, Chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee, reported on the results of the joint committee review on the 4th, stating roughly: "The preparation of the general budget should originally be based on the policy direction. However, because constitutional government is imminent, and the current transitional government cannot formulate the policy direction for this year, the budget for the first half of the year is based on and supplemented by the budget of the previous year. The preliminary budget is 337,148 billion yuan for revenue and 369,438 billion yuan for expenditure. However, due to the need for mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the increase in national defense expenses, and the adjustment of salaries for civil and military personnel, the items in the previous year's budget are no longer suitable. Moreover, because the figures are too large to be included, the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics divides the general budget for the first half of this year into ordinary and special departments. The revenue of the ordinary department comes from regular taxes, and the expenditure is also regular expenditure. The budget for this department can be balanced. The special department is mostly for extraordinary expenditure and the needs of suppressing the rebellion, such as national defense expenses, which are listed as two-thirds, while the other one-third is listed in the ordinary expenditure department.</p>
<p>The ordinary revenue and expenditure are both 234,551,439,700,000 yuan. For the special budget revenue, the Ministry of Finance is confident of 148,775 billion yuan, and the expenditure is 660,712,615,200,000 yuan. The shortfall is listed as debt income in the revenue department before a method of compensation is found.</p>
<p>The total expenditure of the ordinary and special departments is 902,264,005,490,000 yuan, and the revenue is 383,326,439,700,000 yuan. The shortfall between revenue and expenditure reaches 518,937,615,200,000 yuan, which has been listed as debt income in the special department. The shortfall accounts for about 60 percent. After review by the State Council and special committees, the revenue side added one-year stamp duty, customs duties, direct taxes, commodity taxes, mine taxes, surplus materials from the U.S. military, received enemy and puppet materials, state-owned business profits, the sale price of Japanese reparations materials, and the sale of state-owned enterprises, totaling an increase of 200,082.53 billion yuan. The Ministry of Finance declared that the increased amount could be achieved if there were no unexpected changes, and the original listed revenue was 583,408.969,700,000 yuan. On the expenditure side, 20 billion yuan was added under the living allowance reserve item, 40 billion yuan was added under the Ministry of National Defense's management item, and other items were also slightly adjusted.</p>
<p>The adjusted result is the figures listed in the document finally compiled by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review as follows: Ordinary budget: 16 revenue items, 29 expenditure items, each amounting to 266,151.188,900,000 yuan. Special budget: 9 revenue items, amounting to 317,257.780,800,000 yuan, debt income amounting to 379,357.034,400,000 yuan, and 11 expenditure items, amounting to 696,614.815,200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The total expenditure of the ordinary and special departments is 962,766,000,041,000 yuan, and the revenue is 583,408.969,700,000 yuan, accounting for about 61 percent of the total expenditure.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion of the above case, it was decided to return it for review after the administrative authorities provided a policy explanation."</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Attends Legislative Yuan Meeting to Explain Three Major Expenditures in the First Half-Year's General Budget</h3>
<p>After Mr. Liu's report, Premier Zhang explained that since constitutional government was imminent, the State Council had decided that the current government was transitional and could not formulate a policy direction on behalf of the government after the implementation of the constitution. It would still use the old ones from last year, so the budget also adopted a method of extension, with slight corrections compared to the previous year. There are three major expenditures in the general budget:</p>
<p>Military Expenses: The budget of last year saw troop reductions of 3 million people after May, and after the order to mobilize to suppress the rebellion, military expenses stopped shrinking and returned to the original budget. Enriching the 20th Army Group increased expenditures greatly, and it also accounts for a considerable amount in this year's budget.</p>
<p>Living Allowances: This is to seek equality in the treatment of civil and military personnel and to adjust salaries according to the cost of living index. This expenditure accounts for more than 630 billion yuan in the general budget.</p>
<p>Educational Expenses: According to the constitution, educational expenses should account for 15 percent of the central budget. The budget for this transitional period should not deviate too far from the constitutional provisions, so it is included at about 13 percent, making it easier to adjust in the future. Due to the increase in these three budget items, the expenditure is so large today, and the difference is quite large. Other items have to be tightened, and most are only enough to maintain the status quo. This is certainly not what the government wants, but it is also inevitable. Last year, the Ministry of Finance's revenue was about 70 billion yuan. The budget for the first half of this year lists more than 580 billion yuan, an increase of more than tenfold. The burden on the people has also increased greatly. The 39 percent shortfall in the expenditure portion still needs to be resolved through tax revenue and borrowing. To avoid being affected by prices, most budget items have been relaxed. However, based on past experience, even so, it may still be difficult to achieve the expected monthly targets during implementation.</p>
<h3>To Reform the Monetary System, It is First Necessary to Stabilize the Monetary Base</h3>
<p>At this point, Zhang spoke about the monetary system issue. He said: When the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government submitted the budget to the State Council, it attached a major recommendation, that is, to reform the monetary system, strictly control materials, stabilize prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Only then can financial revenue be truly and accurately determined. The National Political Council has also urged the government to reform the monetary system as soon as possible, and public opinion is also advocating this. However, analyzing the current situation, on the one hand, the suppression of the rebellion is underway, military needs are huge, and expenditures cannot be reduced. On the other hand, the Communists are destroying and plundering everywhere, production is shrinking, transportation is blocked, prices are soaring, and inflation is rampant. Under these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to raise the 580 billion yuan under the revenue item. It is impossible to determine financial revenue. Therefore, the basic problem is how to establish a foundation that makes the currency tend to stabilize, and then we can engage in sorting out or reforming the monetary system to complete it smoothly, and we must ensure its continued stability to ensure the people's livelihood. The main key to this basic problem lies in balancing the budget or reducing the expenditure gap, and at least ensuring that revenue does not decrease. For this reason, at the end of last month, there were ten measures to reform finance, economy, and finance. The fifth item of the measures clearly lists the goal of stabilizing currency value. The first three items can be implemented when executing the budget. Others have already been implemented or are being implemented to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. (The questioning of the Legislative Yuan members is published in the special column on the left corner.)</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Approves Partial Amendments to the Water Conservancy Portion of the Economic Program Implementation Measures at the Regular Meeting of the National Economic Commission</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The National Economic Commission held its 33rd regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 5th, presided over by Premier Zhang. First, Deputy Secretary-General Yu Quan reported on Shanghai's price situation and the price situation in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan in the past week. He also explained the positive effects that the establishment of the local financial administration has had on the financial market. Yu claimed that Tianjin's prices only rose by 5 percent in January, and the prices in Wuhan and Shanghai also rose very little. Then, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian reported on the economic situation in Wuhan after inspecting the area. He also explained that Wuhan's prices are now relatively stable, but the local business community believes that Hankou's position is no less important than other regions, and that the amount of loans received in the past has been extremely small, so they requested reasonable treatment. Then, the discussion began: The Water Conservancy portion of the Economic Reform Program Implementation Measures was amended and approved (this is the implementation measure rewritten by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and submitted to the meeting for discussion). The original plan for the transportation portion of the Economic Reform Program Implementation Measures, Article 4, the implementation measures for port management, etc., were also amended and approved. The financial and fiscal departments of the Economic Reform Program Implementation Measures have been partially discussed and will be left for the next meeting to discuss. It is understood that the implementation measures for the Economic Reform Program can be fully discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate of the Taiwan Dollar Is Increased Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] The Bank of Taiwan announced that, starting from the 5th, the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar will be increased by two yuan, that is, one Taiwan dollar will be converted into 104 legal tender yuan.</p>
<h3>The Special Relief Donation Steering Committee is Officially Established in the Capital: The Goal is 10 Trillion, Success Only, No Failure</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Executive Yuan's Special Relief Donation Steering Committee was officially established on the 5th. The first meeting was held at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM, chaired by Wang Yunwu. During the meeting, based on the 10 trillion yuan collection target proposed by Chairman Chiang, the outline of the promotion and the work schedule were discussed, and the decision was made to "only allow success, no failure," so that every wealthy household can take out money. It was also decided to start work immediately. The fundraising committees in ten regions, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hankou, were given a deadline to establish themselves by the 15th of this month and to carry out their work. The committee expects that the entire fundraising and collection work will be completed by the end of June, and the steering committee will be dissolved. The committee members present today included Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Yu Hongjun (represented by Li), Cao Haosen, Liu Butong, Jin Weixi, and Lu Zhonglin. The committee also decided to hold regular meetings every Wednesday to discuss the progress of matters.</p>
<h3>Outline for the Promotion of Special Relief Donations</h3>

<h3>The Relief Materials Handling Committee Will Hold a Meeting with U.S. Representatives Today to Discuss the Distribution of Materials and Other Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Executive Yuan's U.S. Relief Materials Handling Committee is scheduled to hold a joint meeting with U.S. representatives Gilpatrick, Moody, and Hurd at 3:00 PM on the 6th to discuss the distribution of relief materials, the food rationing method, and other related matters.</p>
<h3>Great Harvest in the Eastern Guangdong Suppression Campaign: Notorious Bandit Wu Dong Surrenders and Has Been Incorporated; Huang Jingyi, a Pseudo-Central Committee Member, is Captured and Escorted to Humen</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 5th] The bandit suppression work in the coastal areas of Guangdong Province has achieved great results since the cooperation between the army and navy in the campaign. Wu Dong, a notorious bandit who roamed Dongguan and Boluo, has surrendered with his troops and has been incorporated. Previously, Li Jishen and others, who were hiding in Hong Kong and claimed to be the "Nationalist Party Revolutionary Committee," believed that the bandit had a strong influence and sent "Central Executive Committee" member Huang Jingyi to contact Wu and appoint Wu as "Commander of the East Boluo Column of the Democratic Allied Army." After Wu surrendered, he captured the "Central Executive Committee" member and escorted him to the Humen Fortress Command for interrogation. This is the biggest harvest since the bandit suppression campaign. In addition, the suppression of bandits in Kaiping, Heshan, and other places has also yielded repeated victories, with more than 300 bandits killed or captured. Furthermore, Deng Wenli, a bandit leader in Nanxiong, northern Guangdong, also led his troops to surrender to Ye, the commander of the suppression campaign in that area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Haikou, 5th] Our suppression troops recently used clever offensives to destroy the so-called "Democratic Base" of Nankun, a long-standing nest of bandits.</p>
<h3>The Currency Figures are Not Intended to be Announced; Efforts are Gradually Being Made to Balance the Budget Deficit: Premier Zhang and Minister Yu Answer Questions from Legislative Yuan Members</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] After Premier Zhang Qun explained the situation of the general budget for the first half of this year at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 5th, the members of the Legislative Yuan raised questions or suggestions one after another.</p>
<p>Liu Zhiping said: The revenue department of the budget only sees collections from ordinary people and does not consider the wealthy, and requested an explanation of the adjustment of the cost of living index for public education personnel in March.</p>
<p>A Legislative Yuan member from the Youth Party said, "How can we cope with the issuance of more than 70 trillion currency?"</p>
<p>Zhong Tianxin said: "Not only is the revenue department of the budget a burden on the common people, but if the expenditure department relies on issuance to balance the deficit, the result will be rising prices, which is also a burden on the common people." He also pointed out that the transitional government and the constitutional government cannot be separated. The lack of a policy direction is a mistake. Strictly speaking, two-thirds of the entire budget is to prevent civil and military public education personnel from starving to death, and one-third is to prevent the government from closing down. There is no constructive nature. He suggested that the government's plans include too much and should focus its efforts on doing a few things. Reforming the monetary system, attracting remittances from overseas Chinese, and increasing the burden on the wealthy are the most urgent tasks. We should make great determination and courage to do them.</p>
<p>Sun Jiulu pointed out that the tax revenue should be reorganized to equalize the burden of the poor and the rich, simplify the institutions, and pay attention to the parallel between tax revenue and prices at all times. On the expenditure side, the military expenses are the largest. The principle of elite troops should be adopted. The treatment of public education personnel should be stabilized so that they can maintain their integrity.</p>
<p>Wang asked whether the establishment of Hainan Island was included in the budget, or whether the original proposal had been canceled because Song Ziwen was in charge of Guangdong.</p>
<p>Jian Guansan was concerned about the problem of making up for the budget deficit of more than 40 trillion, saying that relying on the issuance of currency is too dangerous. As for relying solely on foreign debt to balance the budget, it is not reliable and cannot be taught. If the issuance of public bonds is not compulsory subscription, it is feared that there will be little efficiency. Premier Zhang and Minister Yu successively answered, and the key points are recorded as follows: The revenue portion of the budget is entirely based on national taxes and tariffs. The tariff rates set in the 23rd year are no longer entirely reasonable. In addition, salt taxes, direct taxes, etc., have been adjusted. As for the special relief donation, the Ministry of Finance should study effective implementation measures. The treatment of public education personnel, according to the original proposal of the Legislative Yuan, would require 2,756 billion yuan annually, which the government cannot afford. After several studies, the current decision was made. Adjusting the cost of living index once in March is indeed unreasonable, but in fact, due to the limited facts, it is not easy to solve the technical and burden problems if adjustments are made every month. Even so, the government is willing to study a more appropriate method in detail to maintain the lives of public education personnel. The government does not intend to announce the number of currency issued last year. However, it is said that the issuance has reached more than 70 trillion, which is absolutely not the case. Even half of the said 70 trillion has not been reached. As of the end of the previous year, the currency issuance was only more than 2 trillion. Last year, the revenue was about 15 trillion and the expenditure was about 40 trillion. Public bonds, relief materials, enemy and puppet industries, etc., all have supplementary income. Based on this, the actual amount of currency issued is self-evident. Recently, the Communists have been spreading rumors that the amount issued last year was more than 100 trillion, which is absurd. The establishment of Hainan Island has not been canceled, but it is still too early to establish a province. At present, the security of Hainan Island is still maintained by the Guangdong Provincial Security Team. The establishment of a special zone will have to wait a little longer. The budget deficit must be gradually balanced, which cannot be achieved overnight. The Ministry of Finance should study the measures in detail. Relying solely on the issuance of currency is like drinking poison to quench thirst. At the end, Mr. Zhang expressed his deep appreciation for the attention of the members, not focusing on the increase or decrease of a certain number, but on the discussion of the overall problem. He also said that he is determined to implement the ten financial, economic, and financial reform measures he personally drafted to gradually achieve the goal of stabilizing currency value and ensuring people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Developing the Aluminum Industry in Taiwan Province: Implementation Awaits Approval from the Executive Yuan; Reynolds Returns to the United States to Report to Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] A qualified person from the National Resources Commission here has confirmed the cooperation between Reynolds Metals Company and the National Resources Commission in the development of Taiwan's aluminum industry, and said that preliminary results have indeed been discussed. There are two ways of cooperation: one is investment, and the other is the participation of American technicians in the work. As for whether to establish a Sino-U.S. mining company or a similar institution, it has not yet been determined. Reynolds has returned to the United States after coming to Beijing to discuss with the person in charge of the National Resources Commission and will report the results of the negotiations in China to the company. The National Resources Commission will also submit a plan to the Executive Yuan for cooperation with the company, which will be implemented after approval. It is also learned that what is still being discussed is how to ensure the excellent results of this cooperation.</p>
<h3>Minister Yu Reports in the Legislative Yuan that the Mobilization of Overseas Deposits Has Achieved Results</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun gave a detailed report at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 5th on the handling of the mobilization of overseas deposits of Chinese citizens. He said that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have repeatedly negotiated with the United Kingdom and the United States on this matter, but the two countries are still unwilling to change their attitude. In the United States, the U.S. administrative power cannot order banks to disclose the secrets of private depositors, and the laws of each state are also different. In addition, there is a traditional protection of private property. Other countries, such as France, have also had similar negotiations with us, but to no avail. The United States still insists that the depositor's home government should order the depositor to temporarily hand over the money to the state for use, leaving no room for maneuver. As for the United Kingdom, the British government simply refuses to open the list of depositors. As for encouraging depositors to declare and allow overseas wealth to flow inward, although the measures have been drafted and approved by the Political Affairs Conference, they must wait for substantial diplomatic results before they can be smoothly implemented to solve this long-pending problem.</p>

<h3>The United States' $500 Million Aid to China Report is Not Denied by Various U.S. Agencies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] The U.S. State Department did not deny reports of the State Department's recommendation of a $510 million aid plan for China, but at the same time did not acknowledge it. For weeks, the State Department has remained silent on the issue of aid to China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Secretary of State Marshall is preparing to ask Congress again today to approve approximately $1 billion in foreign aid. According to Senator George, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, this money will be used to assist China and pay for the occupation costs of Japan, Korea, and Germany. George did not elaborate, but he knew that this was listed outside of Marshall's European Recovery Program.

<h3>Strange Guest in Kowloon City: Claims to be a Buddhist Disciple and Wants to be a Resident Representative</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 5th] The aftermath of Kowloon City is not over. It is reported that recently, two strange guests, claiming to be Buddhist disciples, asked the residents to be resident representatives for the two arrested people and made absurd remarks. Everyone knew that they were sent by a certain party to instigate discord among the residents and ignored them. The Guangdong Provincial Government attaches great importance to this and sent a special commissioner to investigate the truth, instructing the residents not to believe rumors and to wait for the government to resolve the matter. At the moment, the residents have tidied up Kowloon City and built a new road and a reception room for guests, with no intention of leaving.</p>
<h3>The Salaries of Civil and Military Personnel are Adjusted Monthly According to the Index: The Legislative Yuan Passes a Temporary Motion to be Immediately Submitted to the Government</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Legislative Yuan amended and passed the temporary motion of Legislative Yuan member Liu Zhiping at its regular meeting on the 5th: "It is proposed to suggest that the government adjust the salaries of civil and military personnel monthly according to the cost of living index; restore the rationing of food; increase the salaries of technicians and laborers in various agencies; and specify the post-layoff resettlement measures." The five attached measures are as follows: "The salaries of civil and military personnel throughout the country shall be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index. The food rationing method shall be restored. If the government's subsidies are too large, the selling price may be slightly increased every six months or a year. The salaries of technicians and laborers should be adjusted according to the proportion of public education personnel, that is, they must also be increased by more than 100 percent compared to the old standards to be fair. At the beginning of layoffs, the government should first formulate detailed measures and absolutely prohibit various agencies from laying off employees on the one hand and adding people on the other. The government should conduct a general registration for those who have been laid off and those who are qualified to serve as civil servants. At the same time, the government should also establish production institutions to enable this part of the personnel to engage in production undertakings or transfer them to work in remote provinces. In the future, if various agencies have too many vacancies and have to add people, they should also ask the government to select and dispatch personnel from its registered personnel through examinations. When starting layoffs, reasonable and objective standards should be set, and those who hold multiple positions and salaries should be laid off first. To improve the treatment of civil and military personnel, it must not increase the burden on the common people, but instead open up new sources of income and reduce expenditures. The best way to open up new sources of income is to requisition the domestic properties and deposits of large and small corrupt officials throughout the country. This matter has been repeatedly suggested to the government by all parties, and it is time to resolutely implement it. The most important thing to reduce expenditures is to severely punish corrupt officials who transfer the people's wealth into their own pockets. If these two things are carried out at the same time, the national treasury can be absolutely abundant, the treatment of civil and military personnel will definitely not be left unsettled, and the work efficiency of various agencies can also be increased."</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 5th] Provincial-level agencies in Jiangsu Province will definitely not lay off employees in February, but salaries will be paid at 95% of the original amount. At present, the provincial government is trying to reduce the original vacancies as much as possible to comply with central regulations. As for how to handle it starting next month, it is still under consideration.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle for Liaoyang; National Army Tenaciously Defends</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] The focus of the Northeast war recently has been on the ancient city of Liaoyang in southern Shenyang. According to military authorities, the defending troops are holding firm, the lines of communication are unbroken, and the fighting is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] The battle in Liaoyang has entered an intense stage. On the evening of the 2nd, more than 20,000 bandits launched a fierce attack on the surrounding suburbs under the cover of darkness, reaching more than ten times. Our defending troops calmly responded and repeatedly defeated the stubborn bandits. At the chemical factory alone, more than 4,000 bandits were killed. The two sides fought particularly fiercely for the Taizi River position in Northeast. It was once broken into by bandits on the morning of the 2nd, but after a fierce counterattack by our army, the bridgehead position west of the area was recovered, and the remnants of the bandits are currently being wiped out. (Also, 5th Dispatch) The battle of Liaoyang reached its climax on the evening of the 4th. The bandits showered our side with dense artillery fire and tricked innocent civilians, calling them "human bombs", into launching fierce attacks on the surrounding suburbs. The defending troops waited at leisure and killed countless bandits. There have also been local skirmishes in the areas near Anshan and Yingkou in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] According to Chu Xichun: "I received a telegram from the Liaoyang garrison this morning at 8:00 AM, stating that the attacking Communist bandits had been defeated four times and were fleeing in disarray. The claim that Liaoyang has fallen is not accurate."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Beginning of Another Aggression Plan!</h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch from the United Press on the 4th, the Soviet Union's first five-year plan after the war stipulates the construction of 2,800 miles of railways, including as many as five railways leading to the border of Northeast China and Outer Mongolia. Three of these lead to Northeast China, one is connected to the China Changchun Railway, and the other two are connected to the Siberian Railway. As for the Soviet Union's railway construction plan on the border of Outer Mongolia, its purpose is to cooperate with the highway transportation construction plan of Outer Mongolia. This piece of news released by the United Press is based on a booklet published by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Soviet Republic, and of course, it is a true and irrefutable fact. Let's put aside what kind of ambitions the Soviet Union harbors for Outer Mongolia and our Northeast. Just from this point alone, we can at least see what kind of actions the Soviet Union intends to take in the Far East.</p>
<p>First, the Soviet Union suffered Nazi aggression in this war, and most of its territory in Europe was occupied by the German army. Whether it was production or transportation routes, they were all destroyed by the German army, and the severity of the losses can hardly be expressed in numbers. The Soviet Union is currently engaged in reconstruction work after the war and is about to implement its first five-year plan to lay a solid foundation for a socialist country. In theory, the focus of its construction should be in Europe, especially railway transportation, which is like the main artery of our human body and is of great benefit to the country's recovery and construction. However, the focus of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan for railway construction is not in Europe but in the Far East, which makes people unable to understand and makes them suspect that the Soviet Union attaches special importance to the Far East for other purposes. At the same time, let's take a look at the situation in the Far East. Although the Soviet Union also fought against Japan, the flames of war did not spread to Siberia. All industrial equipment and transportation routes in Siberia were able to maintain their pre-war state. Therefore, the degree to which it needs to build railways at present is far less than its territory in Europe, which is very obvious. But why does the Soviet Union want to shift the focus of railway construction from Europe to the Far East? Apart from the Soviet Union having other plans for our Northeast, it is impossible to find other reasons.</p>
<p>Second, the Soviet Union's behavior towards China after the war, such as moving away industrial equipment from the Northeast, supplying the Chinese Communists with weapons and equipment obtained from disarming the Japanese army to create chaos and rebellion, covering Outer Mongolia and northern Korea with an "Iron Curtain," and refusing to hand over Lushun and Dalian to China, etc., all make the Chinese people suspicious of their ideal that "the Soviet Union loves peace." Recently, Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, published a letter to President Zhou Gengsheng, also bluntly pointing out that "the Soviet Union has become a terrifying aggressive force." After reading Hu's public letter, we are all worried that the Soviet Union will take the place of Japan; today, we see the United Press report that the Soviet Union's first five-year plan is to build five railways directly to our Northeast and Outer Mongolia, which makes us feel even more convinced. The Soviet Union's ambition to encircle our northern border with railways has been exposed, so how can we continue to indulge in the dream that "the Soviet Union loves peace?"</p>
<p>Third, the Soviet Union's railway construction plan has not yet started, so it does not immediately constitute a serious threat, but the Soviet Union is scheming and first encircles our northern border with railways. The consequences that can be created in the future are worthy of our high alert. As the saying goes, "Treading on frost leads to hard ice," and "One leaf falls and autumn is known." We must "prepare for a rainy day" and plan early, and we must not "nip it in the bud." What's more, our country has suffered aggression from strong neighbors and is still in shock, and is full of painful experiences and bloody lessons? The Japanese plan to invade our country also started like this. As Tanaka once stated, "If you want to conquer China, you must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia;" and to conquer "Manchuria and Mongolia," you must first start with railway construction. The reason why they hated Zhang Zuolin was because Zhang built a parallel line to the "South Manchuria" Railway in the Northeast. By analogy, the Soviet Union's attempt to encircle our northern border with railways cannot but be regarded as the beginning of another new aggression plan, and this new plan of aggression will be even worse than what the Japanese did on September 18th and July 7th!</p>
<p>Fourth, the crisis in the Northeast is enough to constitute a source of world chaos. Our newspaper's editorial has repeatedly called on the attention of the Chinese people and political diplomats of all countries in the world. Recently, American Flying Tiger General Chennault wrote an article published in American newspapers, also saying that "the gunpowder keg of the Third World War is now burning in Northeast China; the United States wants to eliminate this threat and needs China's assistance." This is not an alarmist statement, and the situation in the Northeast is indeed extremely dangerous. From an economic point of view, after the Soviet Union moved away all the industrial equipment in the Northeast, only a shell remained, and it may not be possible to restore its old appearance without five or ten years of construction. Leaving aside economics and talking about military affairs, the Communist bandits, relying on the support of international accomplices, occupied almost the entire Northeast in the past year. In order to capture Shenyang, they launched seven offensives, although they were all repelled by government troops. At present, there are no traces of bandits around the Jichang Road; but the bandit army in western Liaoning is still using guerrilla warfare to harass Liaoyang, Xinmin, Heishan, Dahushan, and other places, attempting to cut off the traffic on the Pingjin Road. Why do the Communist bandits want to capture the Northeast at any cost? This is because "ensuring the Northeast and consolidating North China" has always been the Communists' consistent military strategy, and their poisonous scheme to collude with foreign tribes to achieve the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race is obvious. At the same time, on the other hand, the Soviet Union refuses to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and hand over Lushun and Dalian to China, and its intentions are also clear at a glance. In recent days, our country's military authorities have been closely monitoring the movements on the Bohai Sea and have strictly prohibited foreign ships from sailing to Dalian. The development of this situation is enough to show that the flames of war in the Northeast are spreading, and its meaning is not only China's internal strife, but it can indeed be regarded as an international outpost war. After hearing the United Press report and looking at the situation in the Northeast, can the United States still turn a blind eye to the future of the Far East?</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Far East have been exposed. Its attempt to encircle our Northeast and Outer Mongolia with railways is only the prelude to the Soviet Union's actions in the Far East; how can we sit and wait for death and let it encircle us? Furthermore, observing the effect of the Soviet Union's move, it is not only aimed at China alone, but also harbors other long-term plans. Even if the United States does not think about the peace of the Far East, it should also consider its own interests. How can it continue to stand by and watch the increasingly serious situation in the Far East deteriorate? We still remember that during the September 18th Incident, we pointed out that the Japanese ambition was to dominate the Far East, but the Americans did not pay much attention; today, the Soviet Union is watching fiercely, and the Communist bandits are acting as internal support in China. Can the American allies and the Chinese people still regard the Communist bandits' rebellion as China's civil war?</p>

<h3>Qinghai Tar Monastery Lantern Festival Will Not Be Extravagant This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Xining Dispatch, 5th] The grand butter sculpture lantern festival held by Tar Monastery in this province every year during the Lantern Festival is colorful and magnificent, and guests from China and abroad gather, which is extremely prosperous. However, its cost is about 1 billion yuan per year, which is all from the monastery monks begging for alms and the donations of religious people. This year, there are very few alms and donations, because after the foreign troubles and internal strife, the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. Therefore, in accordance with the state's intention to save consumption, this year's grand event is temporarily suspended. Moreover, the Living Buddha of the monastery divined in front of the Buddha, and the result was also that this year's lantern festival should not be held on a grand scale, and attention should be paid to chanting scriptures and praying for the success of the chaos suppression and the meaning of peaceful reunification should be shown. Now the Living Buddha and others of the monastery have gone to report to the Qinghai Provincial Government and have been approved. Therefore, this year's Tar Monastery will focus on chanting scriptures and praying for victory, in addition to a small-scale lantern festival.</p>

<h3>U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, Discusses Sino-U.S. Relations, Clarifying U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, this city] U.S. Consul General Cabot gave a speech at the Rotary Club today, expressing regret over the many misunderstandings in China regarding U.S. policy. Mr. Cabot's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"Among the many deep impressions I have gained since I arrived here, most are pleasing and fascinating, but we regret to say that one impression in particular fills me with dismay. Given the decades of friendship and understanding that have existed between China and the United States, and given the high regard in which your public opinion organs are held, this impression surprises me even more. What I am referring to is the various misunderstandings about the United States and its policies that seem to exist here.</p>
<p>"Within China, a belief seems to be widespread that the United States is, on the one hand, neglecting China, and on the other hand, is fostering Japan, making it a pillar of the East to prevent the spread of communism. Surely, the Chinese people will not forget that we have donated more than one billion U.S. dollars in money and goods to relieve the Chinese people and restore their economy, and our relief supplies continue to flow into China. Given the ten years of destruction and suffering that China has suffered and the war against Japan, China is our ally, heroic, persevering, and our important politicians have made it clear that our purpose is to continue to provide aid to the Chinese people, the only question is how to make it effectively realized.</p>
<p>"So look at what has happened in Japan. We have deprived Japan of its fleet, disbanded its army, dismantled its armaments industry and military bases, and taken over many widely dispersed islands, the island network that the Japanese used to attack Pearl Harbor in bad faith. We hope that the Japanese will join the peace-loving countries of the world and strive to promote peace and improve living conditions throughout the world, but we will never be so foolish as to return weapons to them at an early date, knowing that we went through long and costly years of war to knock the weapons out of the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>"The second most popular misunderstanding I find is that we give aid to other countries for selfish purposes – that we do this to maintain our own prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen, no country can become wealthy by giving its materials and the products of its labor to others. The prosperity of the United States does not depend on these contributions. On the contrary, the aid we give to other countries means sacrifices made by every family in the United States. Because we ship wheat, oil, steel, and many other products abroad to help countries that are not as fortunate as we are, there is a shortage of these products in the United States, and in a free economic system like ours, a shortage means higher prices.</p>
<p>"I think it is important for our Chinese friends to understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. At home, our aid to China program is also under attack. Many people in the United States want to forget what is happening in other countries and focus our efforts on domestic issues. Given the unfortunate situation that still exists in so many parts of the world and the progress that is being made to correct this situation is so slow and disappointing, it takes great determination from the American people to continue this sacrifice to help other countries – all the more so for our relative security and for our traditional neglect of foreign affairs. Those Americans who recognize the seriousness of the world's problems and are striving to make the United States fully involved in solving them will be disappointed to hear unfair criticisms in friendly countries, because such criticisms only serve to make our work at home more difficult.</p>
<p>"The third misunderstanding that seems to be very common in this country is that U.S. policy is motivated by material or imperialistic motives. Let us again review the record: we have disbanded our triumphant army, dismantled most of our fleet or put it in reserve, destroyed a large part of our aircraft, restored our war factories and converted them to peaceful uses, and withdrawn our combat troops from virtually every post stationed abroad. If we were planning military adventures, would we do that? Those who regard us as imperialists should note, for example, our recent actions in Panama.</p>
<p>"We have given hundreds of millions of dollars through the United Nations to aid certain countries, and these countries now say that we are threatening them. Regardless of whether we are called economic imperialists, we have spent billions of dollars to restore the economic productivity of the countries most affected by the war. We are now considering a plan drafted by European countries, not ourselves, that asks us to spend billions more dollars to accomplish the same goal.</p>
<p>"Some suspect that the United States has designs on Taiwan. I think this is a contradictory observation, especially in light of our granting freedom to the Philippines, this observation is indeed absurd, and there is not much criticism here of another foreign imperialism, which actually occupies a part of China's territory, despises your government, and extends its tyranny to China through those who attack what it considers the legitimate government of China, and boasts of its success.</p>
<p>"One more point: some criticize the United States for the agreement on China that President Roosevelt reluctantly signed at the Yalta Conference. Strangely enough, the United States is criticized for succumbing to pressure and agreeing to certain concessions that were detrimental to China, but the powerful country that exerted pressure on the United States at that time and enjoys these concessions today has not been criticized much. Moreover, if the Yalta Agreement had been supported with respect, and the Chinese government could restore its national sovereignty throughout the country, would the situation not be better than it is today?</p>
<p>"When I first heard these absurd misunderstandings, I did not understand how this could happen. We are loyal to our old friendship, have helped China a lot, and have never done any harm. The basic facts displayed here are fully understood. However, two days after I arrived in Shanghai, thousands of students held anti-American demonstrations over an accident (which did not involve the United States) and painted anti-American slogans on buildings. The students' thinking is aimed at being trained for the truth, how could they go astray?</p>
<p>"Then I thought of the distorted views of China that are popular in the United States. I thought of the small things that are made into big things and the big things that prove the small things wrong and are easily overlooked. I thought of many decent people who believe in the distorted facts about China and sincerely spread them. We have discovered a small group in the United States, a group of people who are disloyal to the country, who frantically try to overthrow our country and system. They can repeatedly deceive many sincere and sensible people to spread their harmful toxins, and no one even suspects its source. These foreign lackeys of tyranny certainly want to destroy the old friendship between China and the United States. Perhaps a group of favorites of this tyrannical country are also busy in China. All who believe in cooperation between free countries for the common good must always be wary of such slanderous rumors. These rumors seek to replace international friendship with misunderstanding for malicious purposes.</p>
<p>"The United States hopes that one day in the future it will be able to shift the thoughts and spirit that are devoted to solving foreign problems today to solving its own domestic problems. We also hope that one day our people at home will have better food, better clothing, and better housing. We believe that with our energy and ability, we will be able to achieve our goals, but we know that freedom is more precious to us than material happiness, and we believe that the people in other parts of the world share the same belief. It is precisely for this reason that we are helping others to resist the infiltration of an unprecedented tyranny. Our policy is to support peace and freedom, so that every country, large or small, can freely determine its national destiny according to its national ability."</p>

<h3>Soviet-Romanian Military Alliance Signed, Jointly Defending Against Aggression for Twenty Years, U.S. Accuses Romania of Violating Treaty and Depriving People of Basic Freedoms</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] It was announced here today that the Soviet and Romanian delegations, after three days of negotiations in Moscow, have signed a Soviet-Romanian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance with a term of twenty years, signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Romanian Prime Minister Groza on the 4th on behalf of the two countries at the Kremlin. Marshal Stalin personally participated in the negotiations and was present at the signing.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] Molotov said after the signing of the treaty, "It is of special significance to conclude this treaty at a time when instigators of a new war in the imperialist camp are attempting to organize political and military blocs against democratic countries (referring to communist countries)." Prime Minister Groza said, "This treaty is sufficient to show our emphasis on permanent cooperation."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] A Moscow telegram broadcasted by Associated Press today said that the Soviet-Romanian Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed yesterday will be implemented quickly and will be ratified in the shortest possible time. There are six articles in the new treaty. In the first article, the two contracting countries agree to take joint steps to prevent future attacks by Germany or other countries that directly or indirectly ally with Germany, and express their willingness to participate in any "international action to maintain peace and security." The second article stipulates that if one of the contracting countries is attacked by Germany or another country, the other country must immediately provide all military force to help resist the aggression. The third article states that the two contracting countries guarantee that they will not participate in any international agreement that may endanger the other party. The fourth article stipulates that in the event of "any important international issue concerning both parties," the two countries must consult on countermeasures. The fifth article states that the two countries are determined to reach a good relationship in the spirit of mutual understanding and will not interfere in the problems of other countries. The sixth article states that the treaty will be effective for twenty years from the date of signing, unless one of the contracting countries notifies one year before the expiration that it will not continue, otherwise it will be automatically extended for five years.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The U.S. government has ordered its minister to Romania, Schoenfeld, to present a note to the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accusing Romania of violating the provisions of the Romanian Peace Treaty and accusing the current Romanian regime of attempting to eliminate the last remaining democratic opposition forces in the country. Britain also submitted a similar note to the Romanian government last weekend. The U.S. note stated that during the Romanian elections of 1946, the Romanian government used or agreed to use all fraudulent and oppressive methods to reduce the legitimate political activities of the opposition. The note further pointed out that after the Romanian government signed the Peace Treaty in February of last year, its police department intensified its planned activities to eliminate all political opposition forces. Mass arrests occurred throughout the country, with thousands of people imprisoned in the enclosures, suffering from hunger and disease in prison, and forced to confess, which would be used as the basis for trials.</p>
<h3>Soviets Build Five New Railways, Connecting Borders of Northeast China and Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] According to a pamphlet published by the Soviet Ministry of Education received here, the Soviet Union is currently building five railways to the borders of Northeast China and Outer Mongolia. Three of the five new railways, which lead to the Northeast, are part of the 2,800-mile railway line stipulated in the post-war five-year plan. The pamphlet stated that a 500-mile railway line will connect Ulan-Ude, east of Lake Baikal, with Nosikhin on the border of Outer Mongolia. The second railway line will run from Borzya in northern Northeast China to Suyuikiske on the Mongolian border. The Soviet railway construction plan on the Mongolian border is coordinated with the highway transportation construction in Outer Mongolia, and the highway construction in Outer Mongolia is also based on the new five-year plan of Outer Mongolia, which was first adopted by the Mongolian People's Republic. According to a dispatch from Ulan Bator (Kulun) from the official Soviet TASS News Agency, the five-year plan will increase the number of automobiles in Mongolia by 250 percent. Automobiles will be transported to the Soviet Union through the new railway from the border of Outer Mongolia in the plan. On the other hand, Mongolia will transport a large number of livestock to the Soviet Union. Under the five-year plan, Outer Mongolia will increase livestock production to 31.1 million heads. As for the three railway lines built on the Chinese border, one is connected to the China Changchun Railway, and the other two are connected to the Siberian Railway. The Soviet pamphlet also stated that a branch line will be built westward from Karannor, leading to Duojiekui on the Ergun River on the Chinese border. The second branch line will connect the Birobidzhan Mountain area with Leninskoye on the left bank of the Heilongjiang River. This route is called the lifeline of the Soviet Union and the Jewish Autonomous Region of Birobidzhan Province, and can be regarded as a construction to encourage Jewish colonization. The first branch line is about 80 miles long, almost entirely parallel to the Pacific coast, running from Baranov in Vladivostok to Posyet, an important Pacific port on the border between China, Korea, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office Spokesman Clarifies Meaning of Western European Alliance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] A British Foreign Office spokesman commenting on Swedish Foreign Minister Unden's statement that Sweden will strictly adhere to neutrality and will not participate in the Western European alliance system recently proposed by Foreign Minister Bevin said that Unden apparently misunderstood Bevin's views on the matter. Bevin's purpose is for Western European countries to organize their affairs both individually and collectively, so that Western values do not disappear under the pressure of poverty and internal strife. Among Western European countries, Britain and France hope to have treaty arrangements with the Netherlands and Luxembourg because Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg all face common problems in Germany. Later, Bevin also stated that he would further go beyond the scope of neighboring countries to promote the idea of a Western European alliance, but he also stated that the formal relationship between Britain and various countries might not be exactly the same. The spokesman continued that Sweden's participation in the Marshall Plan is deeply welcome, and each country should decide on its own how to contribute to helping Western Europe restore economic prosperity.</p>

<h3>Italy Will Ban Political Militias According to the Constitution, Aiming to Deal with Communist Underground Elements</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 4th] Amid rumors that guerrilla militias led by the Communist Party are about to appear in uniform, it is generally expected that the Italian cabinet will decide to take action in the cabinet meeting within five days to prevent political parties from organizing uniformed military forces. However, it is anticipated that Prime Minister De Gasperi and the cabinet do not currently possess sufficient power to disband the Garibaldi Brigades of guerrillas. At most, they will issue a declaration stating their determination to enforce Article 18 of the Constitution, which prohibits military groups with political objectives.</p>
<p>Although this declaration applies to other groups such as armed neo-fascists, its primary purpose is to deal with communist underground elements.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Cabinet's "Committee for the Defense of the Republican System" Bazziardi will propose punishments for political militias at the cabinet meeting within four days. Those who organize such militias will be sentenced to two to ten years in prison, while participants will be sentenced to up to three years.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 4th] The cabinet will formally set April 18th as the date for the first parliamentary election of the new republic at tomorrow's meeting. The government has been concerned that left-wing paramilitary groups will influence the vote or overthrow the results afterward. It is an open secret that the Communist Party maintains its own military force for self-defense. This private army has paraded in major cities across the country, trained in the wilderness, and been heavily publicized in party newspapers.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Beijing, 4th] Bulgaria has effectively become a one-party dictatorship under the iron fist of Communist Prime Minister Dimitrov tonight. Around 200,000 party members led the change, marching past a reviewing stand where Dimitrov stood, with a Soviet general at his side, as the marchers shouted cheers for Dimitrov. This transition was completed by the reorganization of the "Fatherland Front."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beijing, 4th] The Fatherland Front Congress, after two days of meetings, passed the following program, aiming to completely Sovietize life in Bulgaria: 1. Control private religious schools and transfer all public education to state control. 2. Socialize industry and establish state-run cooperative farms. 3. Strive to revise the onerous terms of the peace treaty and enable Bulgaria to join the United Nations. 4. Base foreign policy on maintaining an unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union. 5. Build the Fatherland Front as the sole public political organization of the Bulgarian people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sofia, 4th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, at the second congress of the Fatherland Front party, acknowledged that Pravda's criticism of his proposal to establish a Balkan federation was a timely warning. He said that Pravda's criticism of his proposal to establish a Balkan-Danubian federation and customs union was a timely and useful warning to prevent hindering the zeal for people's democracy. The Balkan-Danubian countries do not need artificial federations or customs alliances, but rather need to protect and consolidate their independence and sovereignty, and mobilize and organize their people's democratic forces, as the Cominform declaration indicates.</p>
<h3>General Clay Re-discusses Administrative Reform in West Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] At a luncheon of the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris today, General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, said that the administrative reform of the Anglo-American zone in Germany is not a prototype for any future central government in any part of Germany, but merely an economic necessity. The consistent policy of the United States in Germany is to develop a sense of German responsibility in its jurisdiction before obtaining the agreement of the major powers to establish a central government. We are well aware that the power of the central administrative institutions must be strengthened to guide France out of economic disarray. We are most concerned about two points: first, that Germany's economy, in a divided state, can only evoke the German national concept, making it difficult for the rest of Europe to reach an agreement; second, that West Germany's accommodation of people expelled from East Germany will necessitate the use of all resources. The goal of the British and Americans for the merged zone is to establish a government capable of dealing with economic disarray, but its powers will be limited. These powers will ultimately be vested in the German states. Clay then solemnly declared that we have no basis to give Germans priority rights from any perspective. Germany's production level is only 42 percent of pre-war levels, while the average for the rest of Europe is only 85 percent of pre-war levels, so Germany is still far behind any country. Clay finally replied to reporters present that Germany's occupied status would have to last until the countries of the world were prepared to accept Germany's participation in international organizations, which could take only ten years or as long as twenty-five years.</p>
<h3>India Arrests Eighty Extremists, Bans All Anti-Muslim Organizations</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New Delhi, 5th] Reliable sources reported on the 5th that the Indian government is cracking down on Hindu extremists, with plans to arrest as many as 100 people. Eighty of them have already been captured by New Delhi police. Police teams are swiftly executing the government's order to ban political groups (especially the Mahasabha) "private armies," and are searching for the leaders of Hindu extremists in various locations. However, twenty people have escaped the police net, and the police have sealed the Mahasabha's headquarters in New Delhi. The Mahasabha has been accused of orchestrating Gandhi's assassination, and the government formally disbanded the Mahasabha on the evening of the 4th, denouncing it as "worshipers of violence" and holding it responsible for Gandhi's assassination.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 4th] Prime Minister Nehru stated that all private armies and groups that oppose Muslims with violence and hatred must be banned.</p>

<h3>Supreme Soviet Meeting Approves Budget</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] The fourth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union declared its closure today after unanimously passing the 1948 national budget. In this budget for the third year of the new Five-Year Plan, revenues total 428 billion rubles, and total expenditures are 387.9 billion rubles. The Soviet Council of Ministers, at the request of the budget review committee, approved an increase in tax revenue of 171.1 million rubles. Before closing, the Supreme Soviet also ratified all resolutions passed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1947, including the prohibition of communication between Soviet citizens and foreign people, the abolition of the death penalty, and the appointment of Bulganin as Minister of Defense and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Kaganovich and Malenkov as Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse; Supplementary Budget Vigorously Opposed by the Left; Government Decides to Withdraw in Order to Compromise</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The Japanese cabinet decided at a special meeting today to withdraw the current supplementary budget bill in order to revise it. The bill has pushed the Katayama cabinet to the brink of collapse due to the strong opposition of the left-wing members of the Socialist Party. The government's withdrawal of the bill is clearly aimed at compromising with the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party and preventing the continuous crisis now facing the cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 5th] After the split between the left and right wings of the Social Democratic Party, the collapse of the Katayama cabinet is imminent. After a meeting yesterday afternoon, left-wing party members decided to withdraw their support for the Social Democratic coalition cabinet. At the same time, the Democratic Party, the second-largest party in the cabinet which tends toward the center, has recently threatened to take the same position as the opposition Liberal Party (conservatives). Therefore, the resignation of the Katayama cabinet is almost inevitable. An editorial in today's Asahi Shimbun believes that the conflict between the government and the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party over the budget for allowances to civil servants may lead to the dissolution of parliament or the resignation of the Katayama cabinet.</p>
<h3>Hull Memoirs, Copyrighted by North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by the Staff of this Newspaper, The Collapse of the Grand Peace Conference in the White House</h3>
<p>On October 5, 1937, President Roosevelt delivered his famous "quarantine speech" in Chicago. Since taking office, Mr. Roosevelt has been struggling to restore normalcy at home, and as a result, he has sometimes been unable to pay sufficient attention to our foreign affairs. For me, I was increasingly concerned about the growing isolationist sentiment in the United States, which could be seen in the activities, letters, petitions, and opinion polls of many peace organizations. I was also very worried about the possible impact of these facts on foreign countries. In September, I learned that the President intended to make an early trip across the continent to the Pacific. So I discussed it with Davis and expressed my firm opinion that the President should deliver a speech on international cooperation during his trip, especially in a city where isolationism was deeply rooted. So I took Davis to visit the President, and we presented him with this idea. He immediately agreed. He said that if we prepared the necessary materials for the speech in advance, he would deliver it during the trip.</p>
<p>We returned to the State Department and prepared the speech in draft form. The famous "quarantine" phrase was not in our draft. The President himself was responsible for inserting this phrase, because he made final revisions before delivering the speech. I did not know that there was such a phrase until after he spoke.</p>
<p>The President said, "The peace, freedom, and security of ninety percent of the world's population are being jeopardized by the remaining ten percent, who are threatening to destroy international order and law. Surely, the ninety percent of the people who hope to live under the law in accordance with the moral standards that have been almost universally accepted for centuries can and must find a way to carry out their will…</p>
<p>"The spread of lawless anarchy in the world is unfortunate, but it seems to be accurate. When an epidemic begins to spread in the human body, civil society approves and will agree to isolate the patient in order to protect the health of the entire society and prevent the spread of the disease."</p>
<p>The reaction to the idea of quarantine was swift and intense. In my view, it had the effect of setting back at least six months the continuous education movement we were conducting to cultivate and enhance public opinion toward international cooperation. Those of us responsible for promoting this movement through speeches, statements, and actions in any possible situation worked hard and did our best, but we were always careful not to go too far, lest the violent attacks of the isolationists would push us back beyond our original position. If we proceed gradually and do not provoke unnecessary opposition, then our words and actions, although not as powerful or far-reaching as we would like, can have a greater effect on the world. Conversely, if we make startling statements or take drastic actions, the intense opposition we provoke will reveal to the world a scene of domestic division.</p>
<p>Six major peace organizations issued a statement declaring that the President "is leading the American people down the road to world war." The American Federation of Labor passed a resolution declaring that "American labor does not want to be involved in wars far away in Europe or Asia." Congressmen Fish and Hamilton threatened to impeach the President. The "Inquiry" newspaper telegraphed Congress to seek opinions, and the results showed that more than two-thirds were opposed to the United States taking joint action with the League of Nations on the Far East issue. A civilian movement was also launched to collect 25 million signatures on a petition to "prevent the United States from being drawn into war."</p>
<p>All these reactions, of course, were pleasing to Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese warlords. This undoubtedly made the aggressor nations bolder and made the European democracies doubt whether we were standing with them in anything other than words. More audacious actions by Japan followed, culminating in the Japanese aircraft sinking the American gunboat "Panay."</p>
<p>In October 1937, Undersecretary of State Welles came up with the idea of a world peace plan. He drafted a very long memorandum and personally took it across the street to the President. He wanted the President to convene a grand meeting of all the diplomatic representatives in Washington at the White House on November 11, Armistice Day. There, the President would deliver a dramatic appeal, asking all countries to sit down together at the conference table and draft the basis for peace. The President would propose an outline for these foundations. One was to reach an agreement on the principles of international behavior; another was to reduce armaments; and the third was economic stabilization. He would conclude that unless peaceful policies were adopted, peace could not last long.</p>
<p>Almost before I knew it, I found that the President had completely agreed to this plan. Staging such a colorful program at the White House was very meaningful to him. For years, he had wanted to invite the heads of state to hold a meeting with him at sea. Around a round table on a battleship or cruiser, he would work with them to draft a lasting peace plan. He had not reached the point of making a formal proposal, but he had sounded out several people. Talk of this idea of his spread, but the reaction was not very good. Ambassador to Rome Phillips wrote to me on October 9, 1936, after his first audience with Mussolini, saying, "Apparently, Rosso (the Italian ambassador to the US) had told him (Mussolini) that the President wanted to meet with the heads of European countries. He smiled slightly when he talked about this, made no affirmative expression, grinned at me, and shrugged his shoulders."</p>
<p>Personally, I felt that a meeting like the one the President envisioned would result in nothing but loss. It was impossible to persuade governments to agree on complicated solutions by sitting around the table and talking to each other for a day or two. For this reason, foreign governments were not enthusiastic about this idea. They knew that the President could not enter into secret agreements, and secret agreements might be the only kind of agreements that could result from such a conference in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Something similar to what Welles envisioned had been proposed by Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, to Ambassador Davis on January 20, 1937, when Davis was passing through Berlin on his way to Moscow. Davis telegraphed me that Schacht had told him that he had been authorized by Hitler to make proposals to France and England to guarantee European peace, fix existing borders, reduce armaments, create a new form of the League of Nations that could function effectively, eliminate sanctions, and obtain colonies for Germany. He said that France had expressed its approval, but England had not.</p>
<p>Schacht then said that he hoped the President could convene an international conference in Washington. When Davis indicated that the President might not be willing to get involved in such a situation unless there were some guarantees of success, Schacht replied that the conference should not be convened unless an agreement had been reached in advance. The conference should not be called an "economic conference" but a "peace conference."</p>
<p>When I found out that the President was determined to hold an Armistice Day conference at the White House, I earnestly opposed the plan, believing it to be illogical and impossible. I outlined the situation as I saw it to the President. In late 1937, Germany, Japan, and Italy had increased their armaments to such an extent that their actions were undoubtedly aimed at aggression, not defense, and at conquest, not peace. At a time when democratic countries should be arming themselves to the greatest extent possible for self-defense, it was extremely dangerous to allow them to indulge in a feeling of complacency with a peace conference. I had seen the danger of military aggression for several years, and now it seemed even closer. Therefore, it seemed completely impractical for the peace-loving countries to launch a new movement to further reduce armaments among themselves while the Axis powers continued to arm themselves madly. Anyone with any information knew that for five years, every effort had been made to persuade the Axis powers to participate in an armaments reduction agreement, but they deliberately refused and instead launched a large-scale rearmament program. The Axis powers would laugh at the peace-loving countries' belated demand for disarmament.</p>
<p>Even if an agreement was reached, what would be its value? All three Axis powers had repeatedly shown their disregard for their promises and their contempt for treaties. The word "treaty" had become something worthless and a laughingstock for Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese. The President was aware of how the Axis powers would react to his appeal. Mussolini had replied that after mobilizing a million people and spending twenty billion lira, he must invade Abyssinia, otherwise his prestige would be swept away and he would incur the contempt of other countries. He was indeed reflecting the sentiment of his Axis partners. They had also mobilized millions of people and spent billions of marks and yen, and they were going to take what they could get.</p>
<p>Welles's somewhat flashy plan was to be unveiled on Armistice Day without consulting or sounding out other countries. At a minimum, it seemed unwise and unfair not to consult Britain and France first. At that time, they were conducting delicate negotiations with Germany and Italy; they were trying to keep the Spanish Non-Intervention Committee in existence and functioning. Therefore, suddenly presenting them with such a flamboyant plan without any prior warning could put them in a very difficult position.</p>
<p>In June 1937, Davis, who was then in London, sounded out the possibility of Prime Minister Chamberlain visiting Washington to meet with the President. Mr. Roosevelt was willing to send an invitation, but thought that Chamberlain should come after Congress recessed in September, and that careful diplomatic preparations should be made before the visit.</p>
<p>Chamberlain wrote to Davis on July 8, and Davis forwarded the letter to the President and me, in which he said that he must decline the idea of holding a meeting with the President in the fall. He said that he did not think the time was ripe. If a meeting that was bound to attract a great deal of attention could not produce perfect results, the impact would be very serious. At present, he did not think we could achieve the desired goal.</p>
<p>In the East, Japan had made it clear that it did not want the West to mediate Sino-Japanese relations. The possibility of it attending a peace conference to reach any major agreement was very small.</p>
<p>In the several conversations I had with the President on this subject, he did not accept the views I expressed. Eventually, the plan was abandoned, and we continued our efforts to rebuild our armaments and to make public opinion understand the serious danger of the impending world conflagration.</p>

<h3>Review and Return of Requisitioned Land; Two Cases of Full Return; 700 Acres in Jiangwan District Requisitioned by the Joint Logistics Department</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The first group of the Central Government Agencies in Shanghai Using Enemy and Puppet-Occupied Land Review Committee of the Executive Yuan held its first review meeting at the Land Administration Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday, reviewing twelve cases of military, official, and transportation agencies in Shanghai using private land. Representatives from the Naval Base Command, Ministry of Transportation, Real Estate Trade Association, Municipal Government, Ministry of National Defense, Port Command, Central Trust Bureau, Air Force Supply Command, and Bar Association attended. The meeting was presided over by the group convener Ma Shaoji and Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping. The review principle was generally that land in urban areas has high use value and should be returned as much as possible. Except for the land actually needed by each agency, which can be requisitioned in accordance with the law, the rest should be returned to the original landowners as much as possible. If the nature of the agency is indeed important, then all procedures for requisition should be carried out in accordance with the law. As a result of the review of the twelve cases, partial return was ordered in five cases, full return in two cases, cases of significant importance were submitted to the general assembly for discussion in four cases, and full requisition was ordered in one case.</p>
<p>The two cases of full return are: 1. The Sixth Arsenal of the Ordnance Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters used approximately ten acres of private land in the Fahua District that had been occupied by enemies and puppets. 2. The First Supply Depot of the Transportation Equipment Storage and Transportation Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters used approximately five acres of private land in the Zhabei District that had been occupied by enemies and puppets. The one case of full requisition is that the First Automotive Equipment Manufacturing Plant of the Joint Logistics Headquarters used approximately 700 acres of private land in the Jiangwan District that had been occupied by enemies and puppets. This plant is the largest automotive equipment manufacturing plant in the country and is in fact already in the process of handling requisition procedures.</p>
<h3>Two Airline Companies to Raise Prices Starting Tomorrow; Fares to Increase by Approximately 30 to 40 Percent</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The air passenger fares for China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) have been submitted to the Ministry of Communications and approved, with a price increase scheduled to take effect on the 7th. The increase will vary from 35 to 40 percent depending on the route. The Shanghai-Hong Kong and Kunming-Hong Kong routes will increase by 40 percent due to foreign exchange expenses, while the Peiping-Shenyang route will only increase by 30 percent to enhance transportation for Northeastern passengers. Most other routes will increase by 35 percent. CNAC General Manager Liu Jingxuan told reporters yesterday that since the beginning of this year, the price of aviation gasoline has increased three times, totaling 47 percent, costing about 60 US cents per gallon. In contrast, the gasoline used by domestic airlines in the United States costs only 29 cents per gallon. The foreign exchange rate has also been raised twice in the past month or so, totaling 34 percent, which has increased the company's foreign exchange expenses. In addition, the recently released cost of living index has also risen by 40 percent compared to last month, which has significantly increased the company's salary expenses for its employees. Under these circumstances, airfares could not be adjusted in time each time, resulting in significant losses. Furthermore, CNAC was recently ordered to open routes to Ningxia and other remote areas. The carrying capacity in these remote areas is poor, and gasoline is transported by special planes, while the fares are the same as those in the interior, which is particularly unfavorable to the company's finances. Therefore, the two companies recently sent special representatives to the capital with relevant data to explain the situation in detail to the Ministry of Communications, and only then were they granted permission to raise prices.</p>
<h3>Two Tobacco Companies Hoarding Silver; Expected to Be Fully Returned</h3>
<p>Geng Taihan, owner of Shunli Tobacco Company on Hankou Road, and Liu Yusan, owner of Zhengyu Tobacco Company on Sichuan Road, purchased and hoarded tens of thousands of taels of silver coins and silver ingots during the occupation of this city. In November of last year, the police received a tip and dispatched officers to seize all of the silver and report it to the Central Bank, which forcibly converted it into legal tender at an exchange rate of one yuan of silver coin (or seven fen and three li of silver ingot) for one yuan of legal tender. The parties involved, Geng Taihan and Liu Yusan, were dissatisfied with this confiscation-like treatment and engaged lawyer Zhou Yizhi to file appeals with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the municipal government, based on the Ministry of Finance's regulation that "people who hoard silver without engaging in trading activities will not be subject to forced conversion." It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has transferred the case to the Shanghai Financial Administration for full handling. If it is determined that the silver held by the parties involved was indeed not used for trading and profiteering, it may be fully returned. The lawyer engaged by the parties involved has recently sought to obtain supporting documents from the City Council to facilitate the application for return. It is noted that Speaker Shen of the City Council specially raised this case at the New Year's celebration this year, considering it a violation of the spirit of the Constitution. The Ministry of Finance's above-mentioned action can be described as a victory for public opinion.</p>

The customs has confiscated them in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Suspects of Disrupting Financial Order to Be Summoned for Preliminary Hearing Tomorrow by the District Procuratorate</h3>
<p>Fourteen people, including Xu Yizhi, who were arrested by the military and police authorities of this city in December of last year on suspicion of disrupting financial order, were detained by the Municipal Police Bureau for a total of 15 days after two extensions were requested due to the seriousness of the case. Recently, all the suspects were released on bail by the police bureau. Now, the prosecutor believes that the case must be re-investigated on a larger scale and has scheduled the first hearing of all the defendants tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Public School Employees in Shanghai Receive Three Dou of Rice Per Month</h3>
<p>The in-kind allocation for public school employees in Shanghai has been decided for all central government agencies in Shanghai. Starting this month, the rice allocation will be changed to a free allocation of three dou. The other four in-kind items - coal briquettes, sugar, oil, and salt - will continue to be distributed as usual. For those who do not receive the three dou of rice, the difference in money will be calculated and issued according to the average market price of rice each month. The difference in money for coal briquettes and oil will be calculated and issued according to verified prices. The allocation method for public school employees in municipal government agencies has not yet been decided. The Municipal Public School Employees Material Supply Committee has telegraphed the central government for instructions. It is reported that the implementation will be simultaneous with the allocation methods for central government agencies. In addition, whether the three dou of rice will be directly collected by the receiving agencies from the grain warehouse or whether the supply committee will still issue allocation certificates for collection will be discussed and detailed allocation methods will be formulated at the committee's 17th meeting.</p>

<h3>Daytime Robbery with Gunfire; Resisting Arrest; A Girl's Clothing Pierced with Four Holes, Fortunately Only Minor Skin Injuries; One Suspect Arrested and Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Yunshou, 37 years old, a native of Ningbo and a customs broker, residing at No. 6, Shaonian Road, Xiaoximen, Nanshi, was visited by three robbers at approximately 2:30 PM yesterday. They broke into the house, threatened Xu's wife with guns, and robbed her of a gold bracelet, three gold rings, a gold chain, and a pair of riding breeches, etc. As they fled, a patrolman No. 7760 from the Penglai Precinct happened to come face to face with them. Seeing the three robbers looking flustered, he ordered them to stop. However, the robbers, in an attempt to strike first, pulled out their guns and fired four shots. Fortunately, the patrolman was able to dodge and was not hit. He immediately drew his own gun to return fire, but the bullet jammed and could not be fired. The situation was critical. At this time, Section Chief Li Dazhi of the Penglai Precinct had already received the report and immediately led Inspector Liang and Police Chief Zhang Shusheng to surround and search the area. They finally captured a suspect, Li Guocai, 24 years old, a native of Yangzhou, in the garret of No. 7, Danhua Lane, Zhonghua Road. A pair of riding breeches, the stolen item, was found on the bed. According to the suspect, he picked it up on the roadside. Whether or not this is true is under strict interrogation. When the robbers fired their guns, a nearby girl, Li Jufen, 14 years old, was hit by a stray bullet. The police sent her to the Penglai Hospital for diagnosis, and it was found that her outer clothing was pierced with four holes, but only her skin was scratched. It was truly a blessing in disguise.</p>

<h3>溫逆宗堯盜賣公產廣肇山莊據理力爭</h3>
<p>[From Our Own Correspondent] Regarding the illegal sale of the old Che Dai Kok Shan Zhuang public property by the rebel Wen Zongyao, the Guang Zhao Association yesterday specially received the press, requesting support from public opinion. According to Huo Shouhua, the representative of the association, the association has been established for seventy years, and the articles of association stipulate: "It has the obligation to preserve and benefit the property of the association," and "It cannot have the right to sell or mortgage the real estate of the association." Unexpectedly, after the August 13th Battle, the rebel Wen Zongyao took control of the association, appointed directors himself, and brazenly sold more than 100 mu of the Shan Zhuang cemetery to Qiantai Bank. In addition to donating 200,000 yuan to the puppet government from the proceeds, he colluded with his appointed personnel to establish another company to engage in speculative businesses such as trading stocks and real estate. Moreover, when signing the sale, he did not consult with public announcement procedures, which was purely a private transaction taking advantage of the opportunity. This is not only a malicious transaction, but also suspected of collusion. After the victory and recovery, the association immediately filed a lawsuit with the court in accordance with the law, requesting confirmation that the land sale was invalid, revocation of the deed, and ordering the defendant to return the original deed, Fang Dan, and attached map documents to the association. This case is currently in the appeal stage and is awaiting the end of the trial.

<h3>The Terror in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[From Our Own Correspondent, Guanyang, 3rd by Air Mail] Wang Haojun served as the chief of the joint security during the recovery of Andong. He lived in the bandit area for two years. Recently, he escaped from the bandit area in Andong and arrived in Qian. He narrated to the reporter what he saw and heard in the bandit area. From a corner of Andong, we can see that the bandits in the Northeast are like floods and ferocious beasts, and the harm is increasing day by day. However, their tricks of coercing and following, gathering crowds to make trouble, and all the brutal acts, are not tolerated by the people in the Northeast, and they are doomed to self-destruction. We can know the autumn by looking at a leaf.</p>
<p>Bandit Military Activities</p>
<p>The actions of the bandit army are sudden and unpredictable. They wander around to disrupt and cause chaos. They gather and disperse irregularly. Therefore, it is impossible to capture the number of their troops and where their main force is located. Wherever the bandits go, they mingle with the local people. The people endure their tyranny, daring to be angry but not daring to speak. The bandit army expands its troops everywhere, and the methods are extremely vicious. Every time it reaches a village, it forces the village cadres and political workers to organize a basic team. Villages have basic teams, districts have district brigades, and counties have county brigades. Those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five must serve. It is called "joining the army" in name. After training on the spot, they rush to the front line.</p>
<p>The bandit army's food and clothing are all taken from the people. In the bandit area, they search every household for food very thoroughly. Each person must pay 70 catties or 100 catties of grain. There is no fixed number of times. They demand it according to the household registration. Those who violate will be executed. The bandits have five civilian clothing factories in Andong, which are forcibly formed by private garment bureaus. They also use cotton cloth and rubber produced by the puppet Dongyang Textile Factory and the East Asia Rubber Factory, but raw materials are very scarce. Many bandit army soldiers wear army shoes in winter. The bandit army</p>
<p>Weapons Are Extremely Scarce</p>
<p>New recruits are only given a few grenades, and each rifle has no more than 60 bullets. What Wang Jun saw on his way to escape, there are more bandits in Xiama Tang and Tongyuan Fort on the Anbian line, only equipped with six cannons and more than ten mountain cannons.</p>
<p>The bandit's training is mainly political, and spiritual talks are important subjects. They fabricate all kinds of rumors, slander the government, and slander the national army, saying that no officials in the central government are not corrupt, and no officials are not corrupt. Civil officials collect people's wealth, and military officers drink soldiers' blood. They also say that the Kuomintang is the base camp of feudal forces. To overthrow feudal forces, we must first overthrow the Kuomintang. Overthrowing the Kuomintang is to overthrow bureaucratic capital, wealthy people, and landlords. Self-cultivating farmers are all remnants of feudalism and should be overthrown. He also told the bandit army soldiers to wear masks to please the people. He said: The people pay money to support the army, the people are the father, and the Eighth Route Army is the son of the people.</p>
<p>Political Activities</p>
<p>The bandits also have administrative organizations. The province has a chairman, vice-chairman, and political commissar. The county has a county magistrate, vice-county magistrate, and political commissar. The district has a district chief, deputy district chief, and instructor. The village has a village chief, deputy village chief, chief of the neighborhood, chief of the large group, and chief of the small group. Ten households are a neighborhood, three neighborhoods are a large group, and five families are a small group. The small group is used as a unit to implement the welcome sitting method. The bandit army uses all kinds of organizations in cities and rural areas as a means of controlling the people. There are trade unions and farmers' associations in the cities, which are all composed of poor people; in the rural areas, there are children's groups and women's associations, which are used as tools for transmitting military and political intelligence.</p>
<p>The bandits are active in rural areas, and their atrocities are the most obvious. Their purpose is nothing more than to cause the rural economy to go bankrupt, the rich to become poor, and the poor to become bandits, expanding the source of chaos. A few examples of their atrocities can be seen in general:</p>
<p>Liquidation and Struggle</p>
<p>Actively carry out, that is, overthrow the rich, the poor turn over, creating bloody terror, causing the rich to die, and making the poor useful. The liquidation method is quite interesting. First, the poor report someone, and then instruct the district and village cadres and the chiefs of large and small groups to convene a mass meeting. For example, if someone reports that a ten-year-old son of a landlord killed a poor man's chicken on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year, the crime of killing a chicken, from this chicken, how many eggs can be laid in a year, how many eggs in a year, how many chickens can be hatched, how many chickens can lay eggs, so calculated, after ten or twenty years, the landlord's land will be cleared in an instant. After signing and stamping, he will be driven out of the village. A slight hesitation will inevitably be beaten to death with sticks.</p>
<p>Pursuing Floats and Digging Roots</p>
<p>This kind of ruthless method is to eliminate landlords to prevent them from fighting back. After dividing their fields and houses, they force them to pursue floats and dig roots, forcing the landlord to give up all his clothes, kisses, utensils, and dig roots, forcing him to give up his private possessions, so that he will be exhausted. Then hang a landlord or evil landlord sign on his head, so that he has no way to beg for food and starve to death alive.</p>
<p>Insult and Hostility</p>
<p>For those who work in central agencies or the families of officers and soldiers serving in the national army, hang a long white cloth lantern at the door with the words "Bandit Family" written on it, and draw a row of coffins below.</p>
<p>Supporting the Front and Protecting the Fields</p>
<p>The poor people who are given land must support the army, support the war, and protect the fields. Once the national army enters, it will be regarded as insufficient support. Not only the fields will not be protected, but their lives will not be guaranteed. The bandits are cruel, and the rich and poor are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Cut Off the Tail</p>
<p>The people who join the bandit group have to work during the day and "confess" at night. If someone speaks differently from the poor, it means that their brains have not been opened. The lighter ones will be confined, and the heavier ones will be beaten violently (called helping). He must reflect, and after many confessions, he is willing to "cut off the tail" (abandon all worries) and willing to "let go of the burden" (donate everything) to be spared from disaster and allowed to join the bandit.</p>
<p>Servant Team</p>
<p>Old men over the age of forty-five and young children of landlords are organized into a farming team to cultivate the land divided by the poor people who join the army, without receiving remuneration, called the "Servant Team." (Reporter Zhao Zhan)</p>

<h3>He Yushu Talks About Jiangsu's Grain Policy</h3>
<p>[From Our Own Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 3rd] Grain requisition is a major political task in the era of suppressing chaos. How is Jiangsu's grain administration situation? He Yushu, director of the Provincial Land and Grain Department, took office in September of last year, and started the grain requisition work for the 36th year from October 15th. This arduous task, on the day he took office, he told reporters, I must do my best to follow the central government's intention of coordinating the army's precision and the people's food.</p>
<p>To this day, Jiangsu's grain requisition work has been going on for nearly four months. The overall collection in the north and south of the Yangtze River has been more than 60%. Now the department is sending a large number of people to the counties to urge collection, and must collect enough on time as scheduled.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Conscription in Kind and Money</p>
<p>A total of 29 counties requisition in kind, including Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Gaochun, Jintan, Liyang, Yixing, Wujin, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changshu, Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jinshan, Songjiang, Yangzhong, Taixian, Jiangdu, Yizheng, Liuhe, Jiangpu, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Shiying, and Huaian. The counties that requisition in money are Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Shanghai, Fengxian, Qidong, Chongming, Haimen, Nantong, Rugao, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Dongtai. According to Jiangsu, there are a total of 63 counties and cities. In addition to the above 44 counties requisitioning in money and in kind, the rest are exempt from requisition due to severe floods and bandit disasters. According to Director He's words to reporters, the central government's stipulated requisition rate last year was one requisition and one borrowing, according to the original tax amount of 4 dou and 4 sheng of real grain per yuan to collect 30% of public grain, totaling 9 dou and 2 sheng. Later, because Jiangsu was the earliest to fall, and the people suffered the most, it was reduced to 40% of the original tax, which is 3 dou of real grain per yuan, 1 dou for borrowing, and 9 sheng for public grain, totaling 4 dou and 9 sheng. This year, after the suggestion of the Provincial Assembly and the central government's consideration, the real tax is 1 dou and 2 sheng, the borrowing is 6 sheng, and 40% of the public grain is collected, which is 4 sheng and 8 ge, totaling 2 dou and 2 sheng and 8 ge of real tax per yuan, plus 1 sheng and 2 ge of accumulated grain, totaling 2 dou and 4 sheng. The total amount of real tax in the province in the 36th year is 5,955,577 shi and 9 dou.</p>
<p>A Lot of Hard Work to Reorganize</p>
<p>Jiangsu has been occupied for the longest time, so most of the old tax registers have been lost. It was decided to mobilize the grassroots to work, ask questions household by household and armor by armor, and recompile the land tax registers to have a basis. Follow the natural terrain, divide into sections, ask the owners according to the land, and then compile the total household register. I heard that there are surcharges for grain requisition in various counties. Is it legal? According to Director He, according to central laws and regulations, it is not allowed to use land as a source of taxes. Later, the provincial government felt that the county finances of various counties were facing difficulties, so it formulated a flexible method and obtained the approval of the Provincial Assembly to temporarily allow surcharges, but the income from the surcharges must be used for (1) national education for a hundred years, (2) strengthening local self-defense work to prevent bandits, (3) local autonomy after eliminating apportionment.</p>
<p>Crushing the Three Demands Policy</p>
<p>Purchasing county-level taxes and county-level finance are based on taxes and grain. In the past few months, because the central government could not purchase at market prices, it led to financial difficulties and could not be resolved. Now, after the suggestions of the county assemblies, the central government is also deeply aware of the financial difficulties of the local governments, so it has decided to purchase at market prices in the future, and also purchase grain at market prices. This is the greatest principle of the central government to cultivate the people's food and military grain, and it can also make it possible to purchase and transport food close to the bandit area to safe areas, crushing the communist bandits' dream of seeking food, one of the three demands policies.</p>
<p>Military Grain is Conscripted and Allocated on Schedule</p>
<p>According to the central government's regulations, from October of the 36th year to August of the 37th year, a total of 1,258,000 large bags of military grain should be conscripted and allocated. To date, four months have been allocated, totaling 430,000 large bags. The central government praised that the province's military grain can be conscripted and allocated on schedule and sent a commendation order.</p>
<p>Launch a Grain Sweeping Campaign</p>
<p>The Land and Grain Department has ordered various counties to urge the collection and sweeping of the 36th year's land and grain in order to collect all taxes and sweep all collections before the end of the year (July of the 7th year). However, since the launch of the conscription work, various counties have shifted their focus and neglected the situation of grain requisition. The provincial government has now issued a notice to various counties that grain requisition and conscription should be carried out together as two major political tasks for mobilizing in the war. They should be planned together and carried out together. Vice Director Hong of the Provincial Land and Grain Department will巡回各縣舉行掃糧運動, 按保逐甲挨戶騐串，限期售征淸楚.(本報記者和香林) also tour various counties to conduct a grain sweeping campaign, check household by household and armor by armor, and set a deadline for selling and collecting clearly.

<h3>Ji'an Cotton Reclamation Field: Cotton, Wheat, and Rice Production Achieve Considerable Success</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Poyang, 1st Day] After the enemy's iron hooves stepped into the gateway of Jiangxi during the war, the counties with the highest cotton production in the province, such as Hukou, Pengze, Jiujiang, Ruichang, and Yongxiu, were successively abandoned. At this time, the Yongxiu Cotton Field, which was responsible for improving cotton production, also stopped working. The Academy of Agriculture, recognizing that cotton production was related to the clothing and food of soldiers and civilians, deemed it necessary to actively increase production. In mid-August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it established the Ji'an Cotton and Wheat Field. After half a year of surveying land, acquiring it, and organizing it, it was finally established. At the beginning of its operation, the field had 15 staff members and 70-80 farmers, with an annual operating expense of only more than 17,000 yuan. In the 30th year of the Republic (1941), Director Yu of the field requested an increase in funding and the expansion of the field by more than 700 mu.</p>
<p>The wheat sown in the field was mostly high-quality seeds taken from Nansuzhou, Anhui, and distributed to Nancheng, Shangrao, Yiyang, Yongxin, Wan'an, Ganxian, Linchuan, and other counties for trial cultivation. As a result of cultivation, the yield per mu increased by two dou two sheng to five sheng. The cotton seeds were taken from Guilin American cotton, Changde Tiezhi cotton, and the field's own domesticated Tuozi cotton, and specially contracted with agricultural fields in Shangrao and Guixi counties to propagate improved seeds. Recently, Yunnan Kaiyuan kapok and Fujian Longyan kapok have also been trialed, all with considerable success.</p>
<p>Cotton trials occupy the most land in the field, followed by paddy fields, and there is also a special experimental plot for special crops. Because the soil in all the newly developed fields has not yet been thoroughly cultivated, although the cotton plants are difficult to fully develop, they still produce many cotton bolls. The paddy fields are mostly planted with "Poyang Early Rice," which bears abundant fruit and yields a very rich harvest. In addition, special crops such as tobacco leaves, pyrethrum, mint, and castor beans all grow particularly lush.</p>
<p>Currently, cotton cultivation occupies 160-170 mu, with more than 20 experimental projects, divided into pure-line breeding and cultivation experiments. Wheat cultivation has been successful after variety testing and yield analysis. There are more than 30 varieties of early rice, and other crops such as castor beans, corn, soybeans, millet, and sorghum are cultivated in separate areas. The field's facilities are designed to be garden-like, with mechanized agricultural tools and technical management, in order to become a standard agricultural field in the province and serve as a demonstration.</p>

<h3>Guaranteeing that Every Student is Not Threatened by Losing Their Education: Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau Stated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau has not yet decided on the tuition standards for the next semester. According to Director Li Ximou yesterday, in the current situation of drastic price fluctuations, it is difficult to set a uniform tuition standard, as the facilities of each school, the composition of the student body, and the financial capacity of the parents are different. What the Education Bureau is currently striving for is to guarantee that every student is not threatened by losing their education, while at the same time improving the situation of schools and teachers who have long been in financial difficulty, increasing equipment, engaging in further studies, and improving teachers' qualifications. Therefore, the collection of tuition fees for the next semester will, in principle, make parents with the ability to pay bear a slightly heavier burden, while strictly implementing the 25% quota of free places stipulated by the Municipal Council. General schools can only raise the number of free places above the stipulated number and cannot go below 25%. No school may refuse to admit students due to tuition fees. If a school cannot afford to pay due to the number of free students exceeding the limit, the school can provide a list, and the Municipal Education Bureau will allocate funds from scholarships and other items to subsidize it. After the above measures are thoroughly implemented, the number of free students in primary and secondary schools throughout the city can reach 80,000 to 90,000, accounting for one-fifth of the total. Even if tuition fees increase, any poor student can still avoid the threat of losing their education.</p>
<h3>Municipal Secondary School Principals Discuss Tuition Issues for the Next Semester</h3>

According to the principals of the municipal secondary schools yesterday, the claim that the tuition fees for the next semester are as high as more than 2.8 million yuan is absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>Impoverished College Students Host Reporters Yesterday, Hoping to Expand Scholarship Quotas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Impoverished college students from major colleges and universities in this city jointly hosted reporters at the Poor Students Association at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. They stated that with rising prices, tuition fees for the next semester are increasing sharply. Although the government authorities have established a unified scholarship system, the quota is limited, which can only solve part of the crisis of students losing their education. They earnestly requested the government authorities to expand the scholarship quota. Based on their current incomplete investigation, they estimate that 60 middle schools need scholarships to help 5,285 students. At 4 million yuan per student, 21.2 billion yuan is needed. Seventeen universities and colleges need scholarships to help 4,859 students. At 5 million yuan per student, 24.3 billion yuan is needed, totaling 45.5 billion yuan. If the price of rice rises in the future, it will be more than this figure, which is a far cry from the 15 billion yuan that the city's Unified Scholarship Review Committee plans to raise. They also stated that the scholarships originally established by the various schools have now ceased activities, and it is difficult for students to raise funds on their own, and even if they are forced, it will be of no avail. Therefore, their only hope for the authorities is to expand the scholarship quota.</p>

<h3>Football Association Compromises and Restores Qualifications of Yan and Li; Victory Finally Achieved on Appeal; Believes Management Neglected Duties</h3>
<p>The Football Committee of the Sports Association, because Shi Shixin and Li Yichen were absent from the practice of the pre-selected team for the World Games, decided to cancel the qualifications of Li to represent the World Games selected team and the inter-port team. Yan and Li did not agree, and the Qingbai Sports Association also expressed dissatisfaction, so they appealed to the Football Committee's Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration Committee issued a meeting yesterday, and the resolution on the appeal case of the two players, Yan Shixin and Li Yichen, was announced as follows after deliberation:</p>
<p>The players Yan Shixin and Li Yichen stated that the Football Committee canceled their qualifications to represent the inter-port team and did not allow them to participate in the World Games selection competition because they did not appear in the match on February 1st, and expressed their disagreement, requesting a judgment.</p>
<p>Resolution: Yan Shixin stated that he had left Shanghai on leave due to business last week, and had notified the manager Xu Wenkui before leaving. Because the plane was delayed that day, he could not appear in the match (and provided proof). According to Li Yichen, he did not receive a notice from the manager, so he did not appear in the match. Manager Xu Wenkui confirmed the matter, but did not formally report it to the Football Committee. Observing the facts, the fault lies with the manager. Yan Shixin and Li Yichen should be restored to their qualifications to represent the inter-port team and allowed to participate in the World Games selection competition. The Football Committee should handle the negligence of duty on the part of the manager Xu Wenkui.</p>
<p>The Qunli team applied for a judgment on the Football Committee's punishment of the team's players.</p>
<p>Resolution: According to the Football Committee's precedent for punishing fouls, the punishment for the team seems too severe. Yu Zhenyue should be suspended from two consecutive matches for his violent actions that led to him getting sent off. Captain Chen Yuanji was given a warning, and the team's warning remains the original sentence.</p>

<h3>Modern Basketball Speed Too High, Some in America Advocate Revision, Restoring Center Circle Jump Ball Can Slow Things Down, World Games Selection Tournament America Uses Old Rules</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] The World Games basketball elimination selection tournament is about to be held in New York, and fans are paying special attention to the selection tournament because of its two-fold appeal: first, the selection tournament can determine the champion team of the World Games; second, the center circle jump ball, which has been absent for a long time, will reappear in the selection tournament.</p>
<p>If a country can defeat the American basketball team in the World Games, it would be an unprecedented upset in basketball history. Therefore, the American team selected on the evening of March 31st at Madison Square Garden in New York should also be the world championship team.</p>
<p>World Games This Year Adopts Old Rules</p>
<p>Because of the war, the development of basketball in other countries has been greatly affected. This year's World Games still adopts the old rules of 1935, which is advantageous for European countries. Shortly before the outbreak of the war, the United States had already revised the old rules, abolishing the center circle jump ball and stipulating that the attacking team is not allowed to delay in the backcourt for more than ten seconds, and any player is not allowed to stand in the free throw lane in front of the basket for more than three seconds. These rules will not be adopted in this year's World Games.</p>
<p>The current American tactic is only offense, not defense. Long Island University coach Pickley therefore advocates restoring the center circle jump ball so that the game can be played at a slower pace. The effectiveness of his advocacy remains to be seen in this World Games selection tournament. There is more than just Gule who is dissatisfied with the drawbacks of American basketball. They are dissatisfied with many things, such as the score of each game often being 85 to 70, the speed being so high that one's neck would break, and the special emphasis on players who are six feet five to seven feet tall. Renowned referee and John Marshall University coach Begovich, University of Kansas's Dr. Allen, radio sports broadcaster Brown Toe, and once-popular player Wah Chad have all advocated revising the rules.</p>
<p>Giant Center Too Advantageous Under the Basket</p>
<p>Begovich and Brown Toe proposed that only one point should be counted for a shot made under the basket to prevent giant-like centers from scoring too many points. Begovich also supports having a jump ball in the center circle after each score, and that at least out-of-bounds balls must pass through the referee's hands before being thrown into the game. He also proposed a "delayed whistle" method: if a player breaks through into the opponent's zone and is deliberately fouled, but the ball still goes into the basket, it should count as a score. If the shot is missed, then the whistle should be blown to announce the foul.</p>
<p>Allen is preparing to stipulate that shooting a basket should be considered a dead ball, to prevent others from following up and tapping it in, and he also advocates restoring the jump ball in the center circle, with five people taking turns jumping. Wah Chad advocates that the distance between the hoop and the backboard should be twenty inches, and it should also be five inches higher than it is now, so that the chance of tapping in is reduced, and also to encourage accurate shooting.</p>
<p>The score of American basketball games is getting higher year by year, and the players are also getting taller year by year. Now, major university basketball teams have at least one player who is six feet seven inches or taller, so the above theories are constantly being discussed.</p>
<p>However, the 1948 World Games selection tournament and the old-style games are the first tests of the slow-paced game, so the coaches and players all say in unison that using this method to eliminate basketball teams to attend the World Games is extremely important.</p>

<h3>Rounding for Bond Interest Rebates Below One Li</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that since the 5% income tax was levied on the bond interest rebate in 1947, the fractional parts below one li have often been excessive, and the calculations of the various handling banks are also inconsistent. In order to ensure consistent calculations and facilitate accounting, the Ministry of Finance has recently stipulated that hereafter, in the event of excessive interest payments with fractional parts, those below one li should be calculated using the rounding method.</p>
<h3>Rumors on the Market That Banks Are Issuing Promissory Notes, Financial Management Bureau Says It Never Happened</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The measures for the management of remittances and cash transportation from various places to Shanghai and Guangzhou, promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, were delivered to the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau yesterday. Rumors on the speculative market were widespread that the Financial Management Bureau had approved commercial banks to issue fixed-amount promissory notes. Yesterday, a person in charge of the bureau said: It never happened.</p>
<h3>Acquiring Finished Products from Manufacturers in Four Steps</h3>
<p>According to sources, state banks and bureaus are actively proceeding with the acquisition of finished products from manufacturers on behalf of the government, and the handling procedures are striving to be simplified, so that manufacturers can obtain convenience in the turnover of funds. The handling procedure can be divided into four steps: The manufacturer fills out an application form for the acquisition of finished products to the state bank and bureau warehouse. After the various bank and bureau warehouses preliminarily review the application and send personnel to inspect the manufacturer's finished products and determine that they can be acquired, they report to the Four-Bank Branch for review. After the branch receives the application transferred from the various bank and bureau warehouses, it sends personnel to re-inspect the various factories to decide whether to acquire them. When the Four-Bank Branch believes that the products can be acquired, it submits them to the regular meeting held the next day for final decision. After the management meeting approves the acquisition, it notifies the National Bank to allocate funds and reports to the Four-Bank Head Office. From the application to the allocation of funds, the procedure can be completed in two days.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Sharply, Trade Association Suspends Trading Starting Today</h3>

<h3>Rice Supply Not Smooth, Sales Price Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the northern and southern markets together received approximately 6,600 shi of rice. The Lunar New Year is approaching, and most of the inland merchants have closed their businesses, resulting in a reduction in supply. The actual sales of the stores have increased, and the market sales are active, continuing to rise. Japonica and indica rice have seen a sharp increase of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and special high-grade white japonica rice has broken through the 1,700,000 yuan mark. With the peak season for the sale of white yuan having passed, the situation is stable. The supply and demand for flour are not strong, but as all goods have risen, it has followed suit, rising by 10,000 yuan. Bran and locusts were shipped in large quantities from Nanjing to Xixi, and the inland merchants stopped importing and started exporting, with Hankou also shipping goods to Shanghai for sale. People's hearts are weak, and the price has fallen by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cakes are being resold by retail investors. The factories are very firm in their selling intentions due to the high cost of raw materials, gradually increasing the price by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories are absorbing supplies, and Qingdao is actively purchasing. The buying interest in this street has strengthened, and the price of soybean oil has soared, rising rapidly by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Mung beans are being targeted by the north, rising sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Red beans are being greedily purchased in small quantities, soaring by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of beans are also strong, continuing to rise by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Cowpeas are being moved by the north, rising sharply by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Red sorghum is sluggish. Corn, under the active purchase of the northern ocean, has reached its peak, rising sharply by 100,000 yuan. Sesame is a rare commodity, soaring by 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are selling briskly during the Lunar New Year, gradually rising by more than 100,000 yuan. There is little fluctuation in the oil market. The supply of soybean oil is still plentiful, maintaining a firm stance. The supply and demand of raw oil are equally matched, with little change. Sesame oil and rapeseed oil are selling briskly, advancing by 100,000 yuan. Clear oil has also increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Small quantities of rare goods are outstanding, continuing to rise by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Control Board Supplying and Selling in the Market, Fine Yarn Prices See Retraction, Cotton Cloth Market Initially Firm and Then Weak</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to adjust the supply and demand of cotton yarn, the Yarn Control Board specially sold yarn in the cotton yarn market yesterday, still adopting the quotation and allocation system. 66 households requested purchases, and 291 pieces of yarn of various counts were requested. As a result, 46 households were approved to purchase, and 208 pieces of yarn of various counts were approved, totaling 268 pieces of 20s yarn. The selling price was 36.8 million yuan for 20s Jincheng, 37.5 million yuan for Shuangdiqiu, 35.5 million yuan for Shuangxi, 36 million yuan for Sailboat, 16 million yuan for 6s Furi Guang, 47.5 million yuan for 32s Lanfeng, 52.5 million yuan for 40s, and 59.7 million yuan for 42s double-strand yarn.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions initially saw prices rising, with good trading. Around 11:30, the Fangjian Company temporarily posted a notice to licensed houses, accepting applications from the industry, and people's hearts suddenly scattered. Guangbang took the opportunity to sell, and there was also a lot of short selling on the table, with prices frequently falling. By the end, the 42s Lanfeng fine yarn had retreated by 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 60.3 million yuan. In addition, the 16s and 10s coarse yarn had stronger sales, with scarce spot inventories and market prices gradually rising by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The other various counts of yarn, both rough and fine, had retreated by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan to 1.5 million to 1.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially opened at high prices due to eager hedging. Later, with the absorption of the local street and the replenishing of goods by the licensed houses, the market price continued to rise. After 10 o'clock, the Fangjian Company listed various high-end goods for sale, and people's hearts suddenly turned flat. By the end, various fine cloths such as the 12-pound Longtou had retreated by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of fine twill also squeezed back 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, but the market for bleached cloth, twill, and colored cloth, such as Shilin cloth, remained strong.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Fangjian Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 31,980 bolts of cloth and 80 bed sheets. There were a total of 712 application forms, of which 20 were from manufacturers, purchasing 5,280 bolts of cloth, and the rest were purchased by various cloth houses.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Market Steady</p>
<p>The raw cotton market trended sideways yesterday, but the foundation remained firm. Cotton yarn retreated slightly, and the cloth market turned strong. Most people in the industry are optimistic, and those with ample funds are still hedging. There are not many inventories in the market. Prices rose slightly, and 462 bales were traded. The delivered price for Lingbao was 6,283,000 yuan, and the warehouse price for Hankou fine velvet was 5,332,000 yuan and 5,373,000 yuan. 460 bales of Hankou coarse cotton, 6,051,000 yuan for Tricot, 4,960,000 yuan for Huoji, and 1,280,000 yuan for Zhou Buzihua.</p>
<h3>Strong Cigarette Buying Interest</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market saw a strengthening of buying interest due to the distribution of goods by industry peers, ample funds, and a loosening of credit. The buying interest in the market was strong, and the market price was rising. Trading was even more brisk later, and the transaction price was even better. As a result, the ten-pack Da Ying Lao Dao cigarettes rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and the 50-pack canned cigarettes also rebounded.</p>
<h3>Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products, Transportation Control Committee Announces Implementation Today, Raw Materials Allowed to be Imported Can be Divided into Two Categories</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Import and Export Management Committee announced today the "Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products." The person in charge of the Export Promotion Office, who is responsible for these measures, gave the following statement:</p>
<p>My country's handicraft products and light industrial products, such as straw hats, embroidery, enamelware, and thermos bottles, have had quite a good export performance in the past. In addition, my country's emerging industrial products, such as yarn tubes and electrical equipment, also have great export prospects. However, the manufacturing of these products mostly requires foreign raw materials. In recent years, due to the limited import of raw materials, the products of various industries have only been sufficient for domestic needs, and exports have been greatly affected. In order to assist manufacturers in obtaining more raw materials outside of the regular quotas and to encourage the export of these manufactured products, so as to achieve the effect of competing for markets and enriching foreign exchange, the committee has formulated the "Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products." These measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. According to these measures, the raw materials allowed to be imported can be divided into two categories. After the first category of raw materials is imported, the manufactured goods should be exported in their entirety. The purpose is to support export industries whose foundations have already been consolidated, such as the gold thread and ramie used for hat making, which is one example. After these raw materials are allowed to be imported, they can assist manufacturers in promoting exports, earning foreign exchange, and encouraging the development of certain rural handicraft side businesses without affecting the domestic supply of materials. According to the regulations of these measures, the foreign exchange sold from the export of products made from these raw materials must be at least two and a half times the foreign exchange required to import the raw materials. In addition, the quantity of raw materials imported is limited to what is directly needed to manufacture a certain quantity of export products. The purpose of importing the second category of raw materials is twofold: one is to expand export markets, and the other is to assist factories in increasing production. In other words, to enable factories to obtain raw materials outside of the quota, so as to increase their production, and to export a part of the increased production to earn foreign exchange to pay for the foreign exchange required for raw material imports. The other part will be retained for the needs of the domestic market, so as to achieve the effect of enriching materials. However, there are many types of products made from these raw materials, and the ratio between the import value of each type of raw material and the foreign exchange value that should be sold after it is made into a finished product is currently being discussed.</p>
<p>When manufacturers apply to import raw materials using these measures, there are two ways to handle the exchange settlement issue. First, if a manufacturer has inventory, they can apply to the committee for the raw materials they need before the goods are exported. When the goods are exported, a part of the foreign exchange earned from the export will be used to offset the foreign exchange required for the raw materials imported later. However, the ratio between the foreign exchange purchased for import and the foreign exchange sold from export should still be handled in accordance with the regulations of these measures. Second, if a manufacturer has no inventory, but the finished products made from its raw materials definitely have sales abroad, they can sell the same amount of forward export foreign exchange to the designated bank when purchasing the import foreign exchange for raw materials. As for the difference, it can be sold successively according to the provisions of Article 3 of these measures when the goods are loaded for export.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Export Promotion Office, according to the regulations of Articles 3 and 4 of Chapter 1 of the "Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products," the types of raw materials in categories A, B, and C, and the ratio between the foreign exchange earned from the export of products made from raw materials in category B and the amount of foreign exchange required for raw materials, should be published by the committee after consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In order to widely solicit information on the actual situation of various industries, anyone exporting light industrial or handicraft products can come to the committee to apply in accordance with the regulations of these measures. After the application is made, the office will consult with the Ministry of Economic Affairs at any time to make regulations, so as to avoid problems afterward.</p>
<p>Second, Article 7 of Chapter 1 of these measures stipulates that applicants should also register with the Export Promotion Office. There is currently no registration deadline set, that is, registration will be processed at the same time when applicants come to the committee for the first time, in order to facilitate matters. However, it is still hoped that relevant industry associations will prepare detailed and concrete plans for the export of manufactured products and the import of raw materials immediately after the publication of these measures and send them to the office. After various plans have been agreed upon in principle, the various manufacturers will submit their applications separately, so as to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth trips and facilitate progress.</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>On the Reasons for Death by Acupuncture and Medicine</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>I previously wrote thousands of words in a certain newspaper, extensively discussing the reasons for death by acupuncture and medicine and methods to prevent it. Sadly, that newspaper had very poor circulation and didn't attract attention. Now, rumors of death by acupuncture and medicine (?) are again very prevalent, which is truly regrettable. Given the practical need, I am writing another short article on the subject.</p>
<p>The German pharmacology expert, Mr. Gutterup, once said, "No drug in the world is absolutely harmless. Any drug can become a deadly weapon within the human body." How profound these words are! If we can carefully savor his words and extrapolate from them, we can understand more than half of the reasons for so-called death by drugs and death by acupuncture and medicine.</p>
<p>Originally, the reason for using injections instead of oral administration of drugs is simply that the patient's stomach and intestines are already in a diseased state, and their absorption capacity is naturally greatly reduced. Therefore, injections are used to achieve a rapid effect of the medicine (such as all emergency medicines). Moreover, some drugs can be very irritating to the stomach and intestines when taken orally, causing vomiting or gastric paralysis. By using injections, the irritation is minimal (for example, oral Euphyllpn is very harmful to the stomach and intestines, but if injected into the muscles, there is only a slight stinging sensation, with no other pain). Therefore, such drugs must be made into injectable forms before they can be used. As for when the gastrointestinal tract has suffered trauma, cancerous tumors, or other inflammatory diseases that prevent the intake of food and water, it is even more necessary to rely on acupuncture and medicine to maintain the patient's life and preserve their nutrition (such as physiological saline and glucose solutions). This, of course, requires no further explanation from me.</p>
<p>However, if drugs enter the body and are handled improperly, they can become poisons and cause great harm, as mentioned above. What about injectable drugs with rapid effects? Therefore, all injectable drugs, regardless of the size of their toxicity or the amount, must undergo detailed chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological experiments before being made into injections. After being made into injections, they must undergo strict sterilization procedures before being sold on the market. All pharmaceutical manufacturers should clearly understand this, so there is no need for me to dwell on it. However, due to the lack of capital, inadequate equipment, and a shortage of talent among Western medicine manufacturers in our country, there are inevitably some who roughly manufacture substandard products. If such immature drugs are used for injection, I do not believe that problems will not occur.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have another point to make. Containers for drugs are generally made of glass. The raw materials for glass are silicates and substances like potassium, sodium, and calcium, among which boric acid and baking soda are used most often. If the mixing is not proper, the resulting glass may have too much acid or too much alkali. Subsequently, if acidic drugs are stored in ampules made of glass with too much alkali, the acidic drugs inside will change due to the alkali contained in the glass. Over time, they will become harmful drugs. Conversely, if alkaline drugs are stored in acidic glass tubes, their medicinal properties will also deteriorate. Therefore, imported drugs can be stored for a long time without spoiling because the glass containers can maintain their neutrality. Nowadays, not only are injectable drugs sold on the market crudely made and substandard, but the glass ampules used to hold them are so thin that they cannot withstand a single flick of the finger. If a doctor does not carefully check the origin of the drug, whether the drug has changed color, whether the solution has precipitated or is cloudy, or whether there are small cracks in the glass tube before injecting the drug into a patient, and instead injects it rashly, I do not believe that problems will not occur. (The lyricist Mr. Xie Tihong once wrote about the fact that after injecting glucose calcium and vitamin BC more than ten times, he suddenly had a reaction and almost died. Also, Mr. Yan Duhuo of the Xinwen Bao had a similar situation with his son. I believe that if a drug is not suitable for injection, a reaction will occur immediately after one injection. Why wait until after more than ten injections before it happens? It is clear that there must have been cracks in the glass tube, causing the drug to deteriorate. The doctor did not examine it carefully and injected it rashly.)</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, drugs that are not suitable for a person can become poisons once they enter the body. Therefore, when doctors treat patients, they must not only carefully consider the condition at all times before prescribing medication, but also pay close attention to the various reactions that may occur after the drug enters the body. For example, we know that patients with heart disease must take or inject heart-strengthening drugs. However, among heart-strengthening drugs, why can some be injected while others cannot, and why can some be injected today but absolutely not tomorrow? All these mysteries can only be known by those who are familiar with physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and other disciplines, and who also have many years of experience. Nowadays, the world is in chaos, and everything is out of order. Those who are cunning and deceitful often abandon the right path and obtain a certificate through dishonest means, and then use it to practice medicine. When they cure a few patients with readily available medicines, they become complacent, as if they have joined the medical community, and speak shamelessly. It is impossible for them not to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Xunzi said, "Be cautious and conscientious, as if facing a deep abyss, as if treading on thin ice." We practice medicine in Shanghai, diagnosing patients, and we are always conscientious and self-disciplined. We know that medicine has no limits, and diseases change frequently. If we are not careful and thorough, unfortunate events can occur in an instant. Nowadays, doctors are not respected, and people often threaten to sue them in court. Therefore, doctors must be especially careful in the diagnosis and treatment of patients, the selection of drugs, and the pre-injection inspection and post-injection observation of injectable substances, in order to avoid trouble. Otherwise, even if the doctor feels that they have done nothing wrong, the words of the public can be overwhelming, and all sorts of troubles will arise. Shouldn't we be careful?</p>
<p>A friend asked me about the reported death from intramuscular injection of vitamin B a few days ago. I replied that it is not yet definitively determined whether vitamin B itself can kill. Although I have seen several reports in the literature from various countries about reactions after injection of vitamin B, there is no sufficient proof in theory. There are many factors that could cause death, and it may not be directly caused by this. Furthermore, I do not know whether the substance injected into the patient was vitamin B or other drugs, so I cannot make a judgment. As for the claim that the patient's face changed drastically immediately after the needle was withdrawn after the vitamin B injection, I believe that this was caused by "shock." The patient's body was already weak, and they also had heart problems. Therefore, after the injection, the sensation of pain triggered a reflex action of the vagus nerve, causing the heart to stop suddenly, leading to death. Several years ago, I injected a vaccination into Miss Xie Jiahua in Shanghai. As soon as the needle was inserted, she fainted. Her mother was beside her, extremely anxious. I told her, "This is shock, there is no need to worry." Then I injected her with a camphor solution, and in less than half an hour, she returned to her original state. I do not believe that this was due to the effect of the heart-strengthening drug. Her heart was healthy, and after a certain period of time, even if there was a reflex action of the vagus nerve inhibiting the heartbeat, it would automatically return to normal. However, if Miss Xie's heart had already had a disease, I would have been in trouble. Just a laugh!</p>
<h3>Treatment of Scabies and Sulfur Poisoning</h3>
<p>— Wang Juerong</p>
<p>Scabies—a highly contagious and very uncomfortable skin disease—is very prevalent in the inland areas. The greatest suffering for patients is the intense itching in the affected areas when the bed gets warm in the middle of the night. Because of the itching, they have to scratch, but the more they scratch, the more it itches, and the more it itches, the more they scratch, often leading to sleepless nights. Although it is not a very serious skin disease, it affects sleep and causes patients to suffer greatly in terms of mental state, so they are all eager for treatment!</p>
<p>Is there a specific medicine for scabies? "Yes"! That is the "sulfur preparation" that everyone knows, especially the famous "Miejie" (oil or ointment).</p>
<p>Can "Miejie" truly eradicate scabies? Yes! It certainly can! However, because some patients use too much, or a few patients have a special "sensitivity" to sulfur, "Miejie" is used, but scabies is not eradicated, and "sulfur poisoning" unfortunately befalls the patient!</p>
<p>I am not a "dermatologist," but three years ago, my second young daughter unfortunately contracted scabies from a neighbor's child. I used a very small amount of Miejie oil to rub on the affected areas every night. After two nights of rubbing, and washing her every morning, more than a dozen papules appeared on the insides of her elbows and legs on the third day, causing very severe itching. I thought that the scabies had not been cured, so I continued to rub "Miejie oil" on the third night (because I had told her to rub it for three consecutive days). On the fourth day, something was wrong! The child's face and limbs were swollen, her urine output decreased, and the itching worsened!</p>
<p>When I went back that night and saw this phenomenon, I knew it must be "drug poisoning"! But looking at the bottle of "Miejie oil", I had truly used only a little bit! It shouldn't have been an overdose. It was probably that this child had an "allergy" to "sulfur preparations"! (In the past, she only needed to inject a very small amount of Xiaozhilong, and red rashes would appear all over her body within half an hour. I will have another special article to describe this point next time.)</p>
<p>In addition to immediately stopping the use of "Miejie," because I found a lot of protein in her urine, I tried every means to detoxify her and urgently treat the "acute nephritis" caused by drug poisoning. After two weeks of treatment, the symptoms of poisoning gradually disappeared, but the nephritis turned into a chronic condition. After another three months of drug and dietary treatment, her illness was truly completely cured! This was the first time I discovered a patient's sensitivity to sulfur ointment!</p>
<p>A few months later, during the New Year holidays, I went to Jintan for something. Because of the recent victory, the public bridges from Danyang to Jintan were destroyed, and long-distance buses were suspended. So I returned to the transportation tools of ancient times and set off by wheelbarrow. When I got on the car, the driver, in order to attract business, guaranteed that I would arrive in Jintan by 5:00 PM! (It was only 10:00 AM when I got on the car). Who knew that by 4:30 PM, I had only traveled half the distance. When I got to Yeling Town, the driver told the truth, saying that the sky would be dark and he could not go forward. I had no choice but to spend the night in Yeling! This town also had a population of 20,000, but there were no hostels. After negotiating for an hour, I finally got the permission of the owner of the sesame cake shop to let us stay in the loft above his shop. The small building was only three feet high. We (also with a Mr. Wu) held the spirit of "a great man can bend and stretch," and stayed in the high building. The upstairs was not "empty," except for a few monthly calendars pasted on the wall, rice buckets, vinegar jars, oil bottles, sauce jars, chamber pots, and urine pots were all around! The shopkeeper kindly offered bedding (we didn't bring luggage), but I looked at the scabies marks on his hands and really dared not accept it. That day was January 2nd, and the weather was cold, no less than today (the day I wrote this manuscript, January 27th). I covered myself with my coat and barely dozed on the straw mattress. Because of the fatigue of the journey, I actually fell asleep. Mr. Wu was not able to "deeply understand my heart," and kindly covered me with "brocade quilt." When I returned from my dream and saw it, this urgency was extraordinary, but the friendship was warm and the kindness was touching, so how could I blame him! The next day, when I arrived at Jintan, I hurriedly took a bath and changed my clothes. After finishing my work, I hurried back to Shanghai, and it seemed that there were already one or two small rashes on my body. In a hurry, I didn't choose a doctor, and I invited myself. A flash of inspiration came to my mind, and I found the remaining Miejie oil from my young daughter and rubbed a little on the itchy area. It was even itchier the next day. I rubbed a little more, and the day after that, a large number of papules also appeared on my hands and legs, which were incomparably itchy! Because I had the experience of my young daughter before, I immediately stopped using Miejie. However, my head, feet, and scrotum were already swollen. That day, Professor Chang Ankun from my alma mater happened to come to my house, so I immediately asked for advice. At first, the professor couldn't immediately diagnose it. After I explained that I had used a small amount of "Miejie" and told him about my young daughter's poisoning experience, he also diagnosed it as "sulfur poisoning"! During this period, I searched through dermatology and pharmacology books, but couldn't find detailed descriptions and treatments for sulfur poisoning!</p>
<p>At that time, what I felt most peculiar was that the papules on the insides of my elbows and legs were about the size of mung beans, and they itched in waves, which was really unbearable! In addition to swelling, the itchy area on my neck developed wheals like cloud heads. What was especially inconvenient was the swelling of the scrotum. That day, I happened to be at the Huafu Hotel having dinner with my friend Zhong Zhifu, and I had to change into Chinese clothes temporarily. Later, after six "autologous blood" injections and six calcium injections, the symptoms of poisoning gradually subsided. During these two weeks, there were trace amounts of protein and a very heavy sulfur smell in my urine!</p>
<p>Six months later, in order to test the sensitivity of this skin, I specifically (for research interest) rubbed some sulfur ointment on the back of my hand. After rubbing it twice, papules began to appear again on the moist areas of my hands and legs on the fourth day! Because it was summer, I carefully studied these papules and found that they were no different from the last time. My "clinical experiment" was finally completed! (Here, I incidentally declare that when a doctor himself suffers from a certain disease, he can better understand the process of the disease! We admire the spirit of Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs!)</p>
<p>In the three years since then, I have paid special attention to this disease and have encountered at least thirty cases. Most of them were due to the urgency to cure scabies, so they overdosed on medicine and developed sulfur poisoning. In the early stage of poisoning, the itching of the papules led them to believe that the scabies had not been cured, so they added more medicine, adding fuel to the fire and making the situation worse!</p>
<p>Among the more than thirty people, those with deeper poisoning all felt severe itching in the anus and genitals! The most severe cases, three people, had swelling and exudation all over their bodies, and their body temperature suddenly increased and their urine output decreased. After the symptoms of poisoning subsided, there were also many people who suffered from chronic nephritis! Fortunately, no one died from poisoning.</p>
<p>Recently, I went to Beijing for something and stayed at the home of a relative. His thirteen-year-old son had also suffered from scabies before. Because he had been bathing in sulfur water too many times, he began to show signs of poisoning. Papules had been found on the inside of his elbow, and there were also wheals on his neck. The doctor diagnosed it as ordinary urticaria. At the same time, his mother thought that the scabies had not been cured, so she still bathed him in sulfur water and applied Miejie. I happened to chat with him and smelled the odor of Miejie. When I asked him about it, I discovered that he had symptoms of poisoning. I told him my experience and told him to immediately stop the sulfur bath. Sure enough, the symptoms of poisoning subsided in less than two weeks! On the way back to Shanghai, I thought that there must be many people suffering from the same disease in various places, so I wrote this article to tell those suffering from the same disease, hoping to express my sympathy!</p>
<h3>Prevention of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>Respiratory infection: Transmitted by breathing in air. This is the most common way for tuberculosis to develop in the lungs. Pulmonary tuberculosis is mostly transmitted by inhalation, such as dust containing tubercle bacilli, which, after entering the body, forms tuberculous lesions. This type of transmission is harmful and common, and is usually very difficult to prevent and manage. This is called respiratory inhalation transmission, which usually occurs in two ways:</p>
<p>(1) Dust transmission: Sputum containing tubercle bacilli is spat on the ground. After drying, it flies with the dust, and others inhale it into their lungs, thus becoming infected. Airflow and strong sunlight are better. The dust in the patient's sickroom also has the potential for transmission and danger. Therefore, some call it a residential disease or family disease. However, in the open field, this type of sputum transmission is not easy. Due to the disinfection effect of sunlight, the risk of transmission is less.</p>
<p>(2) Droplet transmission: When patients talk, cough, or sneeze, if they use too much force, they can spray a large amount of droplets into the air. These droplets mostly contain tubercle bacilli. Ordinary larger droplets can be sprayed to a range of two or three feet away. Tubercle bacilli expelled from the mouth are very active and highly toxic, making transmission rapid and easy. It can directly reach the mucous membranes of others, or indirectly enter the mouth through food, fingers, and other contaminated objects. Therefore, it is easy to transmit in crowded and unclean air circulation.</p>
<p>Placental transmission: Although there are various reports of placental transmission of tuberculosis, it is extremely rare. As for the mixing of tubercle bacilli with sperm to enter egg cells, it cannot be proven. However, there are occasional cases where tuberculosis infection occurs through the placenta, causing the pathogens to escape into the fetal blood circulation. It is not caused by the maternal egg cells containing bacteria and being transmitted to the offspring. This type of direct transmission by the maternal placenta.</p>
<p>Self-inoculation: In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the sputum can cause tuberculosis in other parts of the body through injured areas. Such as laryngeal tuberculosis, skin tuberculosis. There are also cases where intestinal tuberculosis occurs due to self-ingestion of tuberculous sputum. These are all self-inoculation. Other genitourinary transfers are also easily found as secondary events due to hematogenous spread.</p>
<p>Early symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is caused by a type of tubercle bacillus invading the human body and harming body tissues. The body then initiates a self-defense response, not allowing this foreign object to exist in the body. It forms a small nucleus around these tubercle bacilli, surrounds it, and eventually turns into a stone particle. Therefore, this small nucleus is the starting point of tuberculosis, which is also consumptive disease. This is the origin of what is called tuberculosis in scientific medicine. This disease-causing bacterium is therefore called the tubercle bacillus. Since the pathogen of tuberculosis is a bacterium, it is naturally an infectious disease. All those who contract this disease are infected with tubercle bacilli. If they encounter people with strong resistance, or if the number of tubercle bacilli invading is small, or because it is not a very virulent type, it will not cause harm. Conversely, they will be harmed. It can even become severely ulcerated, spread elsewhere, and become unmanageable, causing the patient to die. Almost no part of the human body cannot be harmed, and the lungs are the most commonly affected organ. Patients in the early stages of tuberculosis often have no significant symptoms, so very few people know they are sick and seek treatment early. By the time the symptoms are obvious, the disease is severe, and it is often incurable:</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is not an incurable disease. If patients in the early stages can take good care of themselves, eight or nine out of ten can be completely cured. However, in the early stages, it is most easily overlooked. The so-called early stage refers to the initial stage of the disease. At this time, there are no significant symptoms. Patients may feel coughing, slight fever in the afternoon, and fatigue. They suspect it is a cold, or a chronic addiction, or neurasthenia. Therefore, they are mistaken again and again, and by the time the disease is serious and deep-rooted, it is difficult to treat. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Where is the Candlestick?</h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>The New Testament Matthew Chapter 5, Verse 15 says:</p>
<p>"Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house."</p>
<p>I find this saying very meaningful. Doesn't China also have the same saying: "I wish the monarch's heart would turn into a bright candle, not shining on a brocade banquet, but shining all over the refugee houses"? Isn't it the concluding sentence of the poem "Cure the sore before your eyes, but cut out the flesh of your heart"? But although the poem says so, it is not easy to do. Honestly speaking, shining on a brocade banquet is ultimately more comfortable than refugee houses, and it can also avoid some sense of responsibility. Passively speaking, the people of Wei and Jin said: "Grease and fire burn from the front, talent is a source of harm." It's not necessarily about whether you shine on the suffering of other refugees, but you must first burn yourself, which is a major taboo for Chinese gentlemen of "preserving oneself wisely."</p>
<p>The invention of fire is truly a tragic history, which also symbolizes the difficulty of obtaining light. In Western mythology, Prometheus was imprisoned for stealing fire to mankind. Could it be that the omnipotent God, who aims to nurture all things, did not want mankind to have light and heat? Or does he think that light and heat are the exclusive property of God, the treasures of the gods, and that if humans steal them, they might lose God's rice bowl? This is really difficult to guess. The Chinese Zhurong clan also seems to have had wars when creating fire. I wonder how far the system of Jesus is from the gods and men of Greece, to be able to say such insightful words, no wonder he became an idol worshipped by mankind.</p>
<p>Even with pure lamps, don't you believe that there are those placed under a bushel? I remember when I was studying in middle school, someone used a cotton quilt to block the window and lit an oil lamp to play pai gow, hiding it from the training director as if it were an iron bucket. Light also needs "light" in the world, but darkness also needs "light." In this sense, you can't say that every candlestick is useful. The problem is where it is lit.</p>
<p>The young ladies in the Grand View Garden of the Dream of the Red Chamber often said: "Our Baoyu is an eight-foot candlestick, he can see others, but he can't see himself." This is not a good thing, it means that he is clear about blaming others, but ignorant of his own sins. However, if you take it out of context, then seeing others but not seeing yourself is an extraordinary sacrifice, which is the same as what the Bible says above, "it gives light unto all that are in the house." This is the spirit of a Bodhisattva who sacrifices himself to feed a hungry tiger. Li Yishan's poem says "The wax candle turns to ashes, and the tears begin to dry," although it is compared to love, in fact, as a wax candle, one cannot help but shed tears for one's own sacrifice. Therefore, I think of that Shanghai slang, do you really think that sacrificing yourself is foolish?</p>
<p>People are rational animals, or people are the spirit of all things, I have long believed that it should be discounted. Deer call each other to eat, fish keep each other moist, this is the spirit that humans lack most. One day I saw the way people crowded around the bus stop, and I was filled with emotion. My friend laughed and said: "Don't think that people can crowd just because there are more people. Even if there are only two people who have the same reasons, so when it comes to the rice bowl, of course they will argue with arms and rage, and even use their own strength to fight until the blood flows like a river. ——Being able to compete openly, such as elections, is still okay, but there are even some people who use the way of kicking someone when they are down, which is even worse than fish and deer.</p>
<p>People because the real candlesticks are buried under the bushel, the needed to see the hidden can not be achieved, so they have to put their hope in myths, what Qin mirror hanging high, what burning rhinoceros illuminating the monster, always thinking of having a sacred fire, or a dust-free treasure mirror, to shine out the faces of those dragon turtles and snake gods, even if there is no Zhou Chu down the water to kill clean, at least can know what to avoid. So, aren't these myths and poems the crystallization of the blood and tears of the people?</p>
<h3>Genius and Morbidity</h3>
<p>— Ji Mu</p>
<p>Historically, many geniuses have been morbid, but some geniuses have also possessed sound physiques. Some have explained the morbid nature of genius by saying it is due to overwork. Their nervous systems, arteries, and so on are often overworked.</p>
<p>According to American books, composers like Chopin, poets like Keats, and writers like Stevenson were all consumptive geniuses. The first two died young, while Stevenson lived longer. If they had been able to cure their chronic diseases in their lifetimes, would they have been unable to write first-class masterpieces? Of course, no one dares to say for sure, but to those who believe that genius must suffer from deformities, it seems that the first step for a young person to realize their dream of genius is to contract lung disease!</p>
<p>When we mention morbid geniuses, we naturally cannot forget the two great English poets, Scott and Byron. They were contemporaries who both suffered from infantile paralysis in childhood, which was never cured throughout their lives. Scott's disease was in his right leg, while Byron's was in his left leg.</p>
<p>Byron's left ankle was weak and powerless, and his foot would twist when he exerted himself. However, he was an athletic person who loved swimming and riding. He spent a lot of time moving around on weekdays, trying to keep his body from "getting fat," so as not to affect his beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>As for Scott, his ankles were still strong, but his right leg was shorter than his left by several inches. He was also a swimmer and loved outdoor activities. He may have spent more time riding horses outdoors than Byron. The biggest difference between the two was their different personalities. Scott was naturally optimistic, generous to friends, and loved to tell jokes. Byron, on the other hand, was melancholy and cynical. He liked to mock the world, perhaps because of his illness. Although Scott suffered from the same disease, he did not lose his temper easily. If we say that Byron's lameness was the reason for his fame, then how do we explain Scott's actions, which were no different from ordinary people? In fact, both enjoyed great fame, and even if they had no physical defects, their works would still be immortal.</p>
<p>Finally, Queen Elizabeth of England, whose achievements shone brightly, also suffered from a strange disease, which is also a historical mystery. She was an extraordinary woman and an outstanding ruler. Although she very much hoped to find a suitable husband, have children, and raise a family, she never married. Of course, many people wanted to marry her.</p>
<p>According to historians, Queen Elizabeth inherited some incurable disease from her father, Henry VIII. According to a secret revealed by a man named Baggio at the home of his friend Clement one evening in 1619, fifteen years after the Queen's death, the Queen had an unspeakable "special gift," and a French doctor intended to perform surgery to remove it, but the Queen hesitated and the doctor died before her.</p>
<p>In short, there is a connection between genius and morbidity. It is difficult to say which is the cause and which is the effect. Some geniuses get sick because of debauchery or indulgence in pleasure, while others, like our Taishigong, only devoted themselves to writing after becoming ill and disabled. The relationship between the two varies from person to person.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (64)</p>
<p>When Yuru arrived at Qiyun's house for a visit, it was Little Wang's mother who came to open the door. Seeing an old man who wanted to see Qiyun and asking her surname, Yuru took out a business card and told Little Wang's mother: "I am from Xu Zhu's family. Go and tell her, and your boss will know." Little Wang's mother, upon hearing that he was from Zhu Qi's family, looked at Yuru a couple of times, guessing that he was probably Zhu Qi's father. She hurriedly took the business card and rushed in to tell Qiyun, whispering, "I think that old man is probably Mr. Xu's grandfather." As she spoke, she looked at Qiyun with a doubtful gaze. Qiyun, upon seeing the business card, could not help but be startled. She thought to herself, "Why would Zhu Qi's father come to me in person? Maybe Zhu Qi has already explained it to his family, so the old man came to see me today. But why didn't Zhu Qi tell me beforehand? And why didn't he come with him today?" Thinking this, she said to Little Wang's mother, "Please invite him in!" Then, thinking that the old people she remembered from the past were all diligent, thrifty, and simple, she needed to give him a good impression at their first meeting. She couldn't meet him in her pajamas. So, she called Little Wang's mother back and said, "Please ask him to wait in the living room. I'll change my clothes and come soon." She walked to the changing room, took off her slippers, put on leather shoes, and picked out a gray woolen cheongsam to put on. Only then did she go to the living room. Upon seeing Yuru, she bowed deeply and respectfully. She received the tea from Little Wang's mother's hand and offered it with both hands, then offered cigarettes. She stood aside, not daring to sit down, acting entirely as a junior. Yuru looked her up and down, seeing that she had a clever face and was dressed simply. Her manners were respectful and courteous, completely the attitude of a refined lady, which was unexpected. He asked her to sit down, but she insisted on not sitting. So, he said, "I have a few words to discuss with you today. Please sit down." Qiyun then sat down on a chair below him, sitting sideways. Yuru said with a smile on his face, "I've heard that you are a lady from a prominent family, knowledgeable and well-mannered. Meeting you today, I see that the rumors are true! Zhu Qi has good taste." Qiyun, upon hearing Yuru call her a lady from a prominent family, was both surprised and happy. Then, hearing Yuru say that Zhu Qi had good taste... she lowered her head shyly, assuming that he would bring up the matter of marriage. In the eyes of the older generation, it was nothing more than talking about thrift and diligence, and the lack of property, etc. She had already decided that no matter how the old man described their poor life, she would agree to everything, which would make him happy. Qiyun was filled with wishful thinking, but then Yuru sighed. Qiyun quickly looked up and saw him stroking his beard, staring at her face, and shaking his head, saying, "What a pity! What a pity!"</p>
<h3>Occasional Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Walking through the bustling city in the dim evening.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw the crescent moon. Although the moon in the cold night is clear, there is absolutely no room for you to appreciate it on this busy street. Moving my gaze down from the moon, I saw the four large characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" as if they were presented in mid-air. Suddenly, a faint smoke wafted between the glittering words. Looking closely, it turned out to be the smoke rising from the top of the International Hotel. At this moment, looking around, the flashing neon lights and the noisy voices of people are truly a picture of "universal peace."</p>
<p>Occasionally, I thought of the news reported a few days ago about the restriction of electricity consumption for users, and the story of many factories that had to stop production because the power company was overloaded due to the increasing use of electric heaters and water heaters. I couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion towards this black behemoth towering over the city, an emotion that anyone would have. Since this feeling is something that anyone would have, it is of course unnecessary to write it down, so as not to waste this precious space.</p>
<p>But I think how much better it would be if I didn't have this "occasional thought." In this prosperous world, with its dense population, water heaters and electric lights turn winter into spring and restore light to darkness. A series of beautiful words, given the hateful "occasional thought," all turn into problems and contradictions, becoming ugly and unbearable. In the ballroom, the lights are bright and the wine is green, but an occasional thought reminds me of the frozen corpses by the roadside. During the New Year and Spring Festival, the gongs and drums are deafening, but an occasional thought reminds me of the debts that have not been repaid. Sitting comfortably in a car speeding down the street, an occasional thought reminds me of Zhang Fei, who pushed Zhuge Liang across the bridge...</p>
<p>Once, I decided to stop thinking altogether, even if it was such an occasional thought. "Ignorance is bliss," especially in this era. However, everyone has had the experience of insomnia. The more a person wants to fall asleep, the more awake they feel. My situation of "quitting thinking" was just like a person with insomnia trying to fall asleep. The more I tried not to think, the more I thought. In the end, it was almost random thinking, fantasies, dreams, thinking east and west, thinking wildly, even thinking about why I wanted to think in the first place. An occasional thought could be ignored, but a series of questions that needed answers really tormented me.</p>
<p>There is no absolute freedom or thing in the world, only thinking is a freedom that is endowed to people and can never be violated. Despite prohibitions and mandatory compliance, thinking is free and unrestrained. A prisoner in prison is deprived of all freedom, but the freedom to think will never be lost. In the midst of gunfire, you can think of a peaceful and prosperous world; in high society, you can think of male bandits and female prostitutes. Anyway, only you know what you are thinking. Even if thinking is forbidden, what evidence do you have to prove that my thinking is wrong? Therefore, it is easy to prevent everything, but it is impossible to prevent people's thoughts forever.</p>
<p>However, although thinking is a right and freedom endowed to everyone, not everyone can use it properly. Some people have never even thought that they have the freedom to think. Every morning, they get up, eat three meals, drink a cup of tea, and follow the actions of others, acting for the actions of others, thinking nothing. No, they do think, thinking about how to sleep an extra hour today. Some people are indeed good at thinking, but what they are thinking about is how to turn other people's things into their own things, and to take other people's property as their own. Roosevelt thought about how to organize the United Nations, while Tojo Hideki thought about how to launch the Pearl Harbor attack. It is the same thought, but the results are completely different.</p>
<p>Thinking this way, I cherish my God-given freedom, and I feel a little apprehensive, afraid to think wildly, but afraid not to think, because if I don't think, I am afraid of becoming a walking corpse, a wine bag and rice sack, and wild thoughts are afraid of turning me into a madman or a criminal. And how to make what I think appropriate, and how to put what I think into action, is exactly the question I always yearn to answer.</p>

<h3>Blacks Despising Each Other</h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>In Chinese literary circles, there is an idiom called "writers despising each other." A few years ago, it was used by fashionable essayists as a subject for satirical short essays. The emotions between people are so bizarre that, regardless of blood ties or profession, the closer the relationship, the greater the jealousy and the deeper the hostility. So-called unfortunate events such as "filial impiety" and "fratricide" ultimately occur within a family.</p>
<p>In a similar state of mind, I read about the event of "blacks despising each other."</p>
<p>It is said that during World War II, the movement of troops in various places was frequent. American blacks and French West African blacks, who had rarely had the opportunity to meet before, met in North Africa. West African blacks were very jealous of American blacks because the latter's equipment and supplies were superior to those of the French army. At the same time, they also looked down on their "compatriots," believing that their status was higher because they belonged to the troops who went to the front line to fight, while most American blacks served in the rear of the battlefield. Another reason why West African blacks despised them was that they claimed to be descendants of a lineage of "free men." On the other hand, American blacks were descendants of slaves.</p>
<p>Moreover, West African blacks could speak fluent French, and they boasted that their cultural level was superior. On one occasion, a West African black soldier was chatting with two French civilians. An American black soldier barged in and greeted them in broken French. The West African black soldier glanced at him contemptuously, shrugged his shoulders, and said to the Frenchmen: "Look, here comes an uncivilized idiot!"</p>
<h3>Old Yan and His Former Generals</h3>
<p>— Xue Shou</p>
<p>On the fifth page of the newspaper on the 28th of last month, a half-length portrait of General Yan (Xishan) was published. He still had the same spirit as he did thirty-seven years ago, with only a few more white hairs. He was originally General Fu (Zuoyi)'s former superior. After Fu was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Five Provinces of North China, the Baoding and Zhangyuan Pacification Commissioner's Offices were abolished. Although Shanxi was one of the five provinces, Old Yan's Pacification Director was still in place. The "Jin" of the five provinces was only interpreted as "North Jin." This was reasonable in that the government was giving preferential treatment to an elder statesman and Fu was respecting an old marshal.</p>
<p>Old Yan was not only General Fu's old marshal, nor was he only an old predecessor to the generals in North China, but he was also the "Shanxi Military Governor" of the year before the founding of the Republic, and was one of the first governors at the same time as Li Yuanhong of Hubei and Yin Changheng of Sichuan. At that time, the revolutionary military governments of various provinces used the ancient name "Military Governor" to show that they were different from the Qing government's "Governor-General and Governor." Later, during the Yuan Shikai era, it was changed to "General," and during the Duan Qirui regime, it was changed to "Military Governor." The appointments of Li Yuanhong, Cao Kun, and others also had the names "Director" and "Supervisor." Therefore, "Military Governor" only existed for a short period from the revolution to the early Republic. Many military governors have long been dead, and now only one Old Yan remains, who can be called the "last fruit" of the military governors.</p>
<p>Looking back from today to Cao Kun, Zhang Zuolin, Wang Zhanyuan, Li Chun, Wu Peifu, and others more than twenty years ago, some of them had been "President," "Grand Marshal," and some had been "Inspector General" and "General," but now they have all been sleeping underground for ten or twenty years. In fact, in terms of military qualifications, they were all Old Yan's juniors. When Old Yan was a military governor, Cao Kun, Zhang Zuolin, and Wang Zhanyuan were only division commanders. Wu Peifu was under Cao Kun and was promoted from regimental commander to brigade commander. As for Feng Yuxiang, he was only a battalion commander, and his position was far below that of Old Yan's military governor.</p>
<p>In recent twenty years, Yan and Feng have been mentioned together, which was caused by their participation in the National Revolutionary Army in 1926. At that time, the "Three Zhangs" were entrenched in a corner, resisting the Northern Expedition (the Three Zhangs were Zhang Zuolin, Zhang Zongchang, and Zhang Xueliang). Feng had already turned against Old Zhang, while Yan was being strongly wooed by Old Zhang. Unexpectedly, Yan had already submitted to the National Government, and sent Fu Zuoyi to launch a solitary attack on Youyan, occupying Zhuozhou, and attacking Zhangjiakou in Chahar on the other hand. Old Zhang angrily wanted to use green gas cannons. Yan telegraphed to Zhang Zuolin, calling him "Marshal Zhang Yu," implying that he did not recognize his self-established "Grand Marshal." Old Zhang replied by telegraph, denying the green gas cannon incident, referring to himself as "This Grand Marshal" in the telegram, but Old Yan still ignored it. In 1928, the Northern Expedition was successful, and Yan and Feng each led an army, resulting in a "parallel" situation. In 1930, Wang Jingwei played a set of "expanded meetings" in Beiping, and the two generals Yan and Feng also put together some martial scenes. Therefore, people's impression of the two generals was like the "Yang Family Generals," "Jiao is inseparable from Meng, and Meng is inseparable from Jiao."</p>
<p>However, now the two have long since parted ways. Old Yan still holds on to his forty-year-old territory (Shanxi), which is a unique record for an old general. Not only have the old military governors of the early Republic all decayed, but none of the junior military marshals can remain in one province forever and defend their hometown. It is not difficult to review and know that Old Yan's "military governor qualifications" and Old Yan's leadership of Shanxi are both different from others. Because "Yan is inseparable from Shanxi, and Shanxi is inseparable from Yan," when Northerners mention it, they often call him "an authentic Old Yanxi" (it was customary in the old capital to call people from Shandong Old Dong, and people from Shanxi Old Xi. Yan led Shanxi for forty years, so he is an Old Xi who is old and even older).</p>
<p>Those who have experienced many places, those who obey orders do not last long, Shaanxi, Henan, Gansu, Chahar, Northwest, Shandong, military governors, supervisors, all have been done, promotions and transfers, like flowing water, and now they are flowing to the New World, which is in sharp contrast with Yan's old age in one place. Feng, since the Zhili-Fengtian War in 1924, turned his back on the Zhili faction and returned to the old capital, imprisoned Cao Kun, and expelled Pu Yi, with a full head of steam. Wu Peifu was dragged down by him. Therefore, Old Zhang had the deepest antipathy towards Feng, and would rather join hands with his old enemy Zhang Zuolin to fight Old Feng. Although Zhang Zuolin won Feng's strength in the Second Zhili-Fengtian War and overthrew Cao Kun, he soon turned against him, resulting in the Fengtian-Guominjun War in 1925. (Feng's troops called themselves the National Army.) Feng had not only not an old territory in the North, but also not a single long-term friend.</p>
<p>Yan and Feng had many talented generals under them, but Yan's troops were especially strong. In recent years, most of them have joined the National Army, directly under the Central Government, and are serving the country, sweeping away the colors of the former warlord factions, which is a great progress and a good phenomenon in the military.</p>
<p>The most outstanding of Old Yan's former subordinates is of course General Fu, the current Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Five Provinces of North China, with a great reputation and remarkable achievements, shouldering the heavy responsibility in the North, like the Great Wall. Furthermore, General Xu Yongchang, at the beginning of the victory, represented China and went to Japan to meet with MacArthur and the Allied countries to jointly accept the surrender. He witnessed the Japanese Shigemitsu Mamoru and Umezu Yoshijiro bowing and signing the agreement, completing a major and glorious mission. Also, General Shang Zhen, who served as Chairman of Hebei and Shanxi alternately with General Xu, was an envoy to foreign countries, promoting national prestige, and was both a civil and military talent, experienced at home and abroad, and was a rare talent. As for Old Feng's former subordinates, only Sun Lianzhong served in the Eleventh War Zone during the Anti-Japanese War, with outstanding combat achievements. In the past two years, as Chairman of Hebei and Pacification Director, there has not been much performance. He has now been transferred to the capital, because his previous work is sufficient to record. In addition, people such as Song Zheyuan and Zhang Zizhong had already broken away from the private system, served the country loyally, and died in their duties. As far as the present is concerned, Feng's former subordinates are all withered. (Written in the old capital on January 31)</p>
