<h3 id="c26">上海兵役如何辦理妥善 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>上海市本年度徵兵工作，巳定於四月一日起開始。兵役協會為協助民政機關兵役機關推行役政，現正積極展開兵役宣傳，呼喚有志男兒踴躣服役；另方面成立了抽籤委員會，根據本年以抽韱及志願相輔面行之微兵方式，辦理適齡男子抽籤事宜。兵役本係家經常的行政事務，無論平時戰時，都要教民以戰，培養保衛國家保衛家鄉的力量。上海市依法辦理兵役，創始於去年，因爲平時朱能樹立基礎，抗戰時期又未實行動員，　以上海用的役政，較任何一地都困難。現在全國各地，有志男兒皆起而捍衛國家保護家鄉，唯有上海情緒低落，步步後退，不思振奪，這是上海市民的恥辱。一年一度的徵兵，本年度即將開始徽召，希望上海本年有良好的開始和良好的收穫，期　氣得以轉移，爲全國的示範。</p>
<p>兵役，爲獨立国家生存的要素。主欋設立的國家，有獨立的國防，則有其兵役。被統治被奴役的國家，憲法不規定人民有當兵義務，國家事務不許有兵行政事務，無所謂「國防」的獨立。主權獨立的國家則反是，它的領土主欋和人民，要靠國防來保護，要靠軍隊來捍衛，所以憲法規定人民有當兵的義務。蘇聯兵役法規定人民當兵，不僅是義務，並且是一種權利，是徵當兵是一種榮譽。我國憲法規定人民皆有服兵役之義務，至其如何服役？則以兵役法特別規定之。我國對日抗戰八年，前綫將士能前仆後繼，補充不感　乏，實有賴於兵役法之施行。勝利復員，全國兵役緩徽一年，而兵役法亦於此時作局部的修正，國府於卅五年十月十日公佈施行，並佈告昭示國人曰：『自三十五年十月十日起，遵照修訂兵役法規，繼續實行。凡我國民，須知兵役爲人人必盡之天職，務必互相勸勉，踴躍應徵，庶建軍基礎獲以奠立，國防力量克以充實。』爲輔助兵役法之施行，國府復於卅六年二月十九日，公佈施行兵役法施行法，規定國防部爲全國兵役主管機關。國防部年來爲使兵役配合　亂軍事，又制定徵兵實施要則多項，喚起有志男兒奪勇從戎，藉以充裕兵源。一年以來，各地辦理兵役的表現，雖未臻合理想，然人人偕知當兵是一種發務。</p>
<p>上海市辦理兵役，開始於去年。國為往昔從未樹立兵役　礎，大多數人對兵役法的認識又不夠，所以先行試辦志願兵的微召，一俟有了成效和規模然後依兵役法規定，依抽　方式辦徽集二千九百四十三名，完成了這次的試驗。本年度上海兵員配額是六千名，較去年增多一倍，以上海人口比率來說，這數役是一　善政，要使人人好之；如果辦理不善，則人人惡之，兵役使變成了苛政，那是極不妥當的事。</p>
<p>兵役如何辦理妥善？第一是要依法，不恂情亦不茍且；其次是講求三平：平等，平　　　　。以上是辦　　　　　　精神；至於辦理步驟，和當前應注意的事項，則有下列請端：</p>
<p>（一）關於抽籤依上月二十九日上海兵役會議決定，本年兵役以抽籤徵兵和志願乒相　而行。即是說，先依兵役法辦理抽籤徵召，然後以志願兵補助之。抽籤是徴乒的一種程序，以牠來決定適的男子服役與否，和入　的先後，這是一種很公平的方法。依兵役法之規定，抽籤須在身家關查，免　役　查，身體檢查之後，繼不會發生錯亂，據聞本市徴兵定期本月二十五日舉行，現又有改期二十三日之說，如果上述徽兵處理未完成，急遽徵兵抽籤，必有許多技術上的問題待補救，這是要特別注意的。</p>
<p>（二）關於徵集　兵役法徴兵是依年次辦理的，這是假定在戶籍正確人口普查完成之後；如戶籍不淸楚，出生登記欠明白，依年次徵集是極難合乎實際的。據聞本年度徵兵實施辦法規定，第一期徵集，先以年滿二十年（民國十六年出生者）之一個年次，依次徵集，如不足配額時，依年次逐漸延伸，至足額爲止。現在所謂抽籤，即是抽年滿二十歲之男子，是否足够配額，實不無疑問。太年次的男子是否逃避，徵集是否順利，更不無疑問。上海市推行役政已兩年，依法抽籤仍屬創舉，爲使實施有效，不托空言，徵集年次的範圍似可放寬，旣可减少挑役情事，又可　到徴兵的效果。</p>
<p>（三）關於優待所謂優待，指服役男子入營之安家費用及爾後征屬之　　而言。過去新兵安家費之　　，多取於無出征壯丁之戶，或由殷實之家捐獻，都不是正常的途徑。據聞上海市關於新兵安家費之籌集，正請市府在公用事業收益下及筵席捐娛樂　項下，提撥百分之五充用之，這無疑是解決優待經費來源的合理辦法。不過，安家費是一次救濟性的優待，出征軍人家屬爾後應有各種權益獲得，政府是應該負起責任來的。</p>
<p>（四）關於志願兵依兵學家的研究，英美各國辦理志願兵的經騐，志願兵往往是素質較高的軍隊，現在我國靑年軍，就是依志願兵而服役的。我國現行兵役法，寓有志願兵精神，志願兵是應該提倡的。上海市有廣大的知識靑年，如能呼喚他們愛國家愛家鄉，相信　職靑年優秀男兒，必奮起從戎。一志士不忘在溝壑，勇士不忘喪其元」，聶政殺賊的果敢，是有待招之而往。我們認爲知識靑年志願從軍的重要，希望兵役主管把握時機，登高一呼，仁人志士必接踵而至，殆可斷言。</p>
<p>總之，兵役是國家的要政，人人依法有服兵役的義務，不可逃避，無可假借，今天的國家，已進入非常時期，人人必須爲國效命，有志男兒尤當立下決心，一致奪起，參加提衛國家保護家鄉的運動，以爭取國家的生存，地方的安寗。上海市推行役政，條件優越，希望各級機構，立志將兵役辦好，政府更要與人民打成一片，兵出自民，民即爲兵，共同爲捍衛國家保護家鄉而努力！</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國防部政工局十七日發表十日至十六日之一週戰局分析，全文如次共：去年冬季發動擴軍運動與擴大練兵運動以來，接着又用查思想，查階級，查血緣的三查遝動，以鞏固內部，藉以準備發動全部的流竄，在最近一週中，各戰塲匪軍到處　動，國軍針對着匪的行動，在</p>
<p>東北方面爲集中兵力，週應全盤戰略，於九日晚主動的撤出永吉。爲了顧念人民的生命財產，對於小體滿電廠，甚至市區內的彈渠庫，都沒有破壞。永吉的老百姓，深知共匪的殘暴陰狠，自動的不顧天寒地凍長途跋涉之苦，携老扶幼，情願離鄉別境，隨同國軍共患難，這種不願作奴隸和爭取自由的精神，眞可驚天動地。國軍在掩護人民和政府各機關撤退時，途中曾遇匪獨立第九師，企圖阻擾，在軍民偉大的聯合痛擊下，把匪打潰，並俘匪九百十四人，到十二日十時，全部安全抵達長春，造成了遠東陸地上的「敦克爾克」退兵的奇蹟·</p>
<p>至於四平方面匪軍，用了七倍於國軍的兵力，從四號開始到現在，巳經兩星期了，匪軍在所謂「人海」「肉彈」的戰術下，傷亡已達二萬人以上，國軍取得了這樣大的代價，至十五日下午，才撤出市區，刻仍散在附近市郊地區與匪搏戰中。華北方面國軍在冀東的掃蕩戰一星期以來，捷報頻傳，獲得不少戰果，冀西匪軍爲支援冀東的慘敗，曾科集了一·二·三·四·六·五個縱隊，屡次揚吾要再犯保垣，但在徐水保定間，剛作了一次試探性的擾亂，就被國軍痛擊敗退，這幾天又銷聲匿跡了。</p>
<p>華中方面陳毅願酋爲了挽回他的十一·十二兩縱隊在蘇北東臺慘敗，手忙脚亂的從魯中調了第二縱隊，急急忙忙越路南竄，企圖增援蘇北，但是一路遭國軍打擊，到了述　以南漣水以北地區，便無力掙扎了。同時陳　為了策　蘇北，又派了第九第十三兩縱隊，還加上一個新八縱隊及四個警衛團，共四萬餘兵力，在膠濟綫周村，桓台，淄川等處發動一種牽制性的攻擊，但是到目前爲止，除了付出一萬以上的傷亡代價，仍然不能動搖桓合，淄川。陳匪主力的一·三。四·六·各縱隊，補充尚未完整，被國軍從魯西打到豫東，又從豫東追剿到魯西，在鄲城附近地區，曾被國軍猛烈打擊，到昨日爲止，在魯西幾巳沒有他立足之地，除兩廣縱隊外，不得不大部偸渡黄河北逃。</p>
<p>洛陽方面陳賡匪部的四九兩縱隊及三十八軍，並纠集陳毅匪部由豫東流竄過來的三八兩縱隊一部，共約七萬餘人，從前週八號起便開始竄犯洛陽，我守軍不到一師兵力，抗拒了六倍的匪軍，到了十一日，匪又由晉調來第八縱隊，由狂口渡河參加進犯，我英勇國軍奪勇戰鬥，前仆後繼，斃匪軍萬人以上，匪冒重大　牲，一部已於三日前進入市區，但國軍仍能固守核心及西北角陣地，繼續予匪打擊，現國軍援軍已扺城郊，刑正佈署予匪嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>西北方面匪從八號起就開始用攻宜川的方法，圖製洛川，但遭國軍的打擊，只好中止，十四日匪首彭德懷親率獨工旅及第二縱隊萬餘人，打算繞變蒲城，國軍在蒲城以北地區，又給匪一個很重的打擊，迫使匪掉頭北退，現大股匪徒除大部向西外，一部有上黄龍山落草的模樣，國軍正分由銅川，蒲城向北進擊中。</p>
<p>大別山區的劉匪三。六兩縱隊，仍被國軍分別問殱於岳西以西，經扶以東，羅田麻城以北等地區，一週來斃傷匪軍一千多人，其一·二兩縱隊仍在沈邱以南，新蔡東北，及臨泉附近，企圖北竄，與第十第十一縱隊呼臘，續在黄泛區竄擾，國軍正由南北夹擊中，這一方面最近的淸剿，已證明了人民的力量與國軍聯合成一　了。</p>

<p>旋徐副議長代表參議會報告，決請政府加强保衛東北。繼由東北請願團代表王化一報告渠等請團願之動機及經過，略稱：此番代表東北人民晋京請願，其意義及任務自知極爲重大，蓋所謂東北問題，亦實係全國性問題，其對於整個中國影響極大。東北在國防經濟上具有極大價値，其實藏財富，可舉一實例以證之，即以東北三年大豆　變　，可收回全國流通之法幣總額。東北年產大豆五百萬噸，每噸合美金一百八十元，則積三年　，其數驚人矣。是故中國欲立國，則不可無東北。今日東北局勢已日非一日，萬一共匪佔領整個東北後，則共黨政府立即成立，且可舉大軍侵犯華北以至整個中國，届時情勢何堪設想。東北危矣，望國人及時予以援手！</p>
<p>報告請願結果</p>
<p>王氏繼報告向蔣主席請願之結果，略稱：蔣主席極爲關懷東北人民，請願團晋謁後，將主席已允在軍事，糧食，經濟三方面盡全力支持：（一）軍事方面：中央對於東北之整個計劃決不變更，東北必予死守。過去戰略之應予修正者，亟加修正之。今後策略，除着重於軍事外，對於運用民力亦將並重。（二）糧食方面：糧食部決充分供應東北人民食種，三四兩月糧均巳備足，所顧　有僅爲運輪問題，現正積極設法中。北平至瀋腸之空運路綫已予縮短，俾可日運三次。（三）經濟方面：政府最初發行東北流通劵原屬好意，惟因東北現勢今非昔比，按東北昔日居民總數達四千七百萬人，現僅爲七百萬人，致通貨膨脹，人民被壓逼喘息不已。前東北耆老張作相亦曾建議中央，設法使東北幣制與全國協調，以匯兌額控制幣値，此番與糧食部治商後已有具體解救辦法。</p>
<p>要求履行　中蘇條約</p>
<p>王氏續稱：一行並曾分謁外交部長王世杰及司徒雷登大使，要求外交部，請履行中蘇友好條約。司徒大使接見請願團時，對東北民意趨向極爲重視，對人民對中央是否仍維一貫信心一點，詢問甚詳。王氏最後結論爲：以滿腔苦衷向各界呼籲，東北局勢不能再聽其惡化，挽救東北已屬刻不容緩。</p>
<p>嗣由瀋陽市譏長張實慈致詞：東北問題之解決繫於軍事成功，東北乃剿匪之軍事中心，上海力剿匪之經濟中心，南京乃剿匪之外交中心，如何使三者相互配合，俾剿匪得以早日成功。</p>
<p>提出三點呼籲</p>
<p>田雨時則提出三點呼籲：（一）東北問題是整個的，希望全國統一意志，挽救東北。（二）集中人力物力，加强中央剿匪力量。並希望上海匪起示範作用。（三）永吉失陷後，有義民三十餘萬，隨國軍撤至長春，必須速即沒法救濟。</p>
<p>東北代表致詞完畢後，最後由吳市長起立作結論稱：（一）救東北即係救自己。（二）要剿匪成功，須全國人民及時醒悟，統一意志。（三）爲救濟東北難民，本市冬令救濟會經費項下，決撥一部份購置糧食用品，救濟東北難胞。運輸方法日後再行討論。東北請願團聞言後，全體鼓掌表示感謝之忱。末由宋國瑞小姐代表東北旅滬同鄉會向請願團代表王化一獻花後，茶會迄五時始散。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕楊樹浦底美商上海電力公司，發電量佔全市總電力百分之八十。上海電力公司自一九一三年首次發電，迄今已有三十五年歷史，前租界時代，原爲工部局電氣處，一九二九年與電話公司同時售於美人，遂成爲美商經營性質，但一切組織均遵守我國公司法，聽命於市府公用局。昨晨十時，該公司特邀請新聞界前往參觀，其正副廠長柏理斯（T．C．Pleace美籍）及枯西傑（Kaec捷克籍），於會客室中接待記者，首以簡單明瞭之幻燈片表明發電之步驟，計包括下列各部份：（一）廠內十八架不同之發電機，（二）燃煤皆由駁船運來（三）吊煤車—將煤區地面吊至高處再送入爐內，（四）　煤機—大塊煤需磨成煤屑後始供燃用，（五）帮浦一機—浦江水用帮浦抽入應用，（六）打油帮浦—柴油亦爲主要燃料之一，柴油亦需帮浦機輸送，（七）燃煤粉爐—部份爐子係以煤粉作爲燃料，（八）煤粉均利用螺旋式輸送。記者於觀畢幻燈片後，再經導至各部門作實地參觀，由於幻燈片之指示，使記者對電力之發動極爲明瞭。按電力產生之原動力爲水與燃料。電力公司之抽水帮浦間築於黄浦江底，俾浦江之水可充分利用，循環不息。主要之燃料爲煤屑及柴油，將水燃爲蒸氣，俾推動發動機生電。電力公司機械種類之繁多及配合之得法，頗令業外人驚嘆。該公司每日消耗煤量與柴油量雖多，惟公司目前存煤充沛，約可供一月之用，即或煤源斷絕，尚可以柴油發電，故上海人對電力之供應方面，大可不必有所杞憂。</p>

<p>近半月來物價暴漲，生活指數必隨之升高，工商均感艱困，而美援尚未見之事實，人心不安日甚，記者特走訪潘議長公展，叩詢意見，潘氏答復略謂：市參議會開會時，對此曾有鄭重討論，並作成建議，　外匯牌價切勿隨時掛高，採用進出口聯鎖制，鼓勵出口貨，補貼僑匯，穩定公用事業之價格等等，敢信如用大刀蘭斧手段，決心去幹，當可袖救，至少可能遏止漲風，惜當局迄未重視民意，依舊因襲，以至（一）外匯，（二）物價，（三）工資，三者循環上漲，終無改善氣象。自去年三月至今年二月止，一年來物似至少已漲上二十倍，較之前一年度僅漲五倍左右者相去遠甚。吾人眞不知負責當局此一年中究何所作爲而致此。</p>
<p>人爲因素亟須檢討　目下大局，吾人固須一方面向美國呼籲，軍事援華與經濟援華應同時並進，且時不宜遲，但另一方面，究應努力改革政治，經濟及軍事之一切設施，否則諒病忌醫，縱得外援，亦有何補，不觀近日美國糧食可到而糧價反漲，美國棉花可來而棉價反漲乎？此中人爲的因素，亟須吾人力自檢討者也，市參議會本月六日曾以備忘錄電致美國朝野，呼籲援華，電文中建議，以吾國剿共之軍火糧　服裝等之軍事預算，與普通預算分開，將　援支持我軍事預算之所需，則普通預算必可收支相　有餘，自無再行增發通貨，幣値穩定，人心自安，一切當可漸入軌道，而吾人此時亦當發揮民意，監　中央以及地方政府，促成政治經濟之改革。</p>

<h3 id="c115">杭州！往何處去？ <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十五日訊〕「三冬一靠一春」，杭州的春天一到，住在西子湖邊的人，欣慰地歡迎賺錢的季節。即是市政府的大宗收入，也要　春天的筵席捐等來彌補這一年的市庫。表面上，這明媚的春大之對於杭州，當然是有利的，但實際上，細細的推敲起來，這不免是一種羞辱。杭州似乎除了靠着遊春的人來培育外，其他簡直別無他法了。</p>
<p>我們研究史乘，杭州之成爲都　，倒並不一定是在有名勝的西子湖。</p>
<p>看唐宋時代的情形：「　屋華　，蓋十餘萬家，」馬哥宇羅又說有一百六十萬戶，人烟可謂特別繁盛，而城區河道疏暢，大船都可通行無阻，從北關可深入市區，河旁有棧房數千間，專門寄藏貨物，四方百貨，雲集而來，大街上的買賣，也是書夜不絕，晚間三四更，游人始見稀少，早晨五更鷄鳴，賣平市的就已經開市。可以說杭州之成爲大都市，是因着商買雲集。同時，杭州的手工業也異常發達，宋元時是全國手工業的中心，「有美堂記」中有「其俗習工巧」等語。所以當時的杭州，爲東南第一州，也是全國第一州，而十二世紀的世界全國，當以南宋頂繁富，所以也是世界第一大都會。馬哥孛羅在南宋亡後來遊杭州，仍舊穩爲「世界最美麗華貴之城」——「大城」。杭州，在唐，宋，元的時代，可以說並沒有冀求蔚外來遊客的豢養，而其本身先有其生產的手工業，與繁盛的商業的條件。</p>
<p>明淸以降，手工業已被機械工業所打倒，而接近外洋的上海大都會建立了起來，杭州的地位就沒有從前的重要。到民國時代，上海的發達的工商業使杭州成爲</p>
<p>上海的附庸一切都仰着上海的鼻息，聰明的杭州人士，就以山水來作爲號召，吸引一些遊客，來過度這太平的歲月。</p>
<p>照目前杭州的趨勢看，他當然不會有工業的前途，同樣的，商業的前途，一時也不會超越上海。而一些所謂杭州土產，其實也不是杭州本身所生產的如同核桃，是昌化出產，香榧，是蕭山出產，竹籃，是餘杭，臨安一帶出產，笋尖，笋乾，是臨安，於　一帶出產，所以杭州本身很少特產，即所謂茶葉，也是杭縣，餘杭，紹興等縣來供應的。至於工廠，如果與上海比起來，真免瞠乎其後了。　有人以爲浙贛路通車，與不久以後的錢塘江通航，可以有助於</p>
<p>杭州的發展但是杭州本身如果沒有工業的建設，那麼杭州的繁盛僅是一個商業的轉口點，其經濟價値還是不大的。如果我們要工業建設，那麼如煤，電，原料等等，都一時不　接得上氣來，眞是談何容易。其先天的條件實在覺得不够的。</p>
<p>不久以前，杭州市市議會和浙江省政府，都一再請求中央將杭州</p>
<p>改爲院轄市他們的理由是：「杭州密邇京滬，遠接皖贛，輪軌輻輳，交通便利，自錢江鐡橋落成以後，確扼東南水陸運輸之要樞，各地物產集散於此，是以在經濟上形成全國重心區之一環。至於名勝風景，尤爲舉世所咸知。」這就是說，杭州並沒有他獨特的個性，我們試以南京觀之，他是政治的都市，上海是經濟的都市，北平是文化的都市，都有其獨特的個性。我們又在上面揭露了杭州市的現狀統計，在這統計中也沒有一項是特別偏重的地方，因此我們可以知道杭州市現在還極爲平凡。有人說杭州可以成爲</p>
<p>花園都市是中外人士遊覽的地方。然而如果僅是一些樹木花卉，亭毫樓閣，而毫不充實其精神與內容，則遊人也會覺得極為平儿的。我們嘗知瑞士的日內瓦花園都市，他的文化的培育，費盡了功夫，他們有很多崇高的學府設立在那裏。而我們杭州，最高學府大學有兩所，專科學校兩所，而文化活動者冷寂異常。</p>
<p>杭州的先天條件，不適合於作爲工商業的都會，反之，杭州天然環境的幽靜是適宜於研究，修養著作的地方，所以我們認爲應該建設爲理想的文化城市。記者曾與浙大教授張其昀先生暢談杭州文化城</p>
<p>理想的建設，他認為在壞抱西子的山巓與錢塘江邊，都可以建築房屋，供文化工作者居住研究，則夏天也必感到凉爽。我認爲在杭州應設置研究的機構，同時要歡迎文化工作者來居住，杭州的人士不專門詔媚於達官富買之間，而特別尊重文化工作者，文化活動也要特別加強。如果杭州真的成為理想的文化城市，則其院轄市的名義，也不必僅求在政治上的提高，而其實際的精神上已崇高無比了。（本報特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3 id="c123">從「蝗蟲政策」說到徐州難胞 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十四日訊〕由於地位和交通的原因，徐州名副其實的成了一個難民之城。魯南，魯西，豫東，蘇北，各地流亡的義民，均不約而同的向這個大城市集中，希望利用便利經濟的鐡路交通，向其他安全的都市另謀生計。徐州去年難民集中數字，最高記錄達二十二萬之多！　種人為難民之製造，是匪軍戰略之一種，他們名之日「蝗蟲政策」。其用意是騙使數十萬婦孺難民入政府區域，使負擔這些飢民一切的衣食費用，而不能利用其人力。食糧及其他可驚的消耗，長期的延續下去，將大大的削弱政府的物實力　，其為害　像蝗蟲之對　禾　」收成一樣。</p>
<p>化難民為市民</p>
<p>今日徐州是否有難民存在，在理論上，可以說是沒有了。因爲去年春天起，社會部與江蘇省政府會同決策，鼓勵義民組織武裝還　隊，隨政府大軍進人魯南蘇北的收復區，重整被破壞了的家園。不願還鄉而想長留徐州的，市政府定出一個「化難民爲市民」的辦法，編定臨時保甲以後，中央和地方不再負救濟之責。這個政策推行已將一年了，所以徐州駱市長答覆記者團詢問時，就說過去集中在本市的難民均巳成爲市民，在理論上是完全正確的。　但是，難民問題是否已在事實上實告解決了呢？這可自兩方面去看：先說武裝還鄉隊，組織之初，原有甚高的期望，但實行之後，問題就多了。首先是還鄉團本身的自衛能力薄弱，完全依仗大軍保護。可是軍隊是時常調動的，戰區內許多縣份淪陷克服，可反覆至三四次甚至七八次之多，在此情形之下，還鄉的武　義民就成了匪車回報復對象，其遭遇之慘痛有不忍言的。許多已經回鄉的義民，因此長途跋涉，重返徐州。這是第一種情形。</p>
<p>義民區域訪問</p>
<p>那些願意長居徐市的義民，他們六名義上已經成爲「市民」了，但是他們的日常生活如何？在徐州五個舊義民集中的地區，記者還擇了靠老飛機塲最大的一個，在陸總和市府可感謝的協助之下，作了一次實地的調查。我的懷疑得到了證實。</p>
<p>這一區現在已經編成三十四，三十五兩個保，居民共計一三·八六七人。他們都是山東和蘇北來的，過去可說都是薄有資產，三十五年春始流亡在徐州。抵達之後，就在飛機塲舊址上各以自己的財力人力，蓋了一些房子，作爲庇身之所，當地蘇寗救濟分署，曾按戶撥款十萬元補助。由於富力的不等，這些義民的建築，有的是比較可住的土屋，有的是一人甚至於半人高的茅棚，而前者僅佔總數的五分之一。一年後的今日，他們的生活狀况已不堪言。土屋的光綫空氣已經談不上，但尚堪人類生存。至於茅棚區，人一進去，即有地獄之感。茅棚高約三四尺，建築材料是茅草和泥土，因爲門開得低，人必須爬進爬出，地上舖些柴草，就算是張床。一個茅棚裏可能住上六七口大人和小孩。這已經在人類的生存綫的邊緣上掙扎，談不上衛生，更談不到體面。茅棚是蔽不了風雨的，這四天琮，徐州風雨苦寒，茅棚裏的婦孺是哭哭啼啼。我目擊兩個死屍，正在家屬的哭聲中掩埋。活着的人，亦是囚首鳩面，無復人形。</p>
<p>日常生活悲慘</p>
<p>他們的伙食，豆餅拌山芋片是上品，得來很不容易。天雨三日，許多人就挨了餓。自美國救濟物資運華後，社會部有十二噸的小麥，撥交這裏的慈善團體，以施粥的方式，救濟這裏的難民。規定每一人每日可領得十二兩，勉强維持生活。可是問題是粥少僧多。我參觀的一區，人口是一萬三千八百六十七，其中受到施粥救濟的，僅僅只有五十名！</p>
<p>記者參觀的僅是一區，但是其他各區的情形，亦可推想得出。熟天一到，這些茅棚區勢必成為疫氣的起源地。對於這些同胞的非人生活，任何有良知的人目擊後，都爲他們同情而担憂。難民的處理，是一個極端嚴重的課題。這些都是已經安定了的難胞，生活尙且如此之苦，正在流亡中者，實是不堪設想。最近匪軍　蘇北又有　動，沭陽等地被陷後，難民十五萬人，流離播遷，奔向國軍區內，求取救濟與保護。現傳抵宿遷者已有十一萬人，當地國軍目擊同胞之苦難，本於人類之同情心，自動節食一天，加以救濟。現在，這批難胞中的大部份，正向徐州行進，如何　頓和救濟他們，成了這　軍政機關的大問題。因爲徐屬各縣，目前已深感糧荒之嚴重，現正各方設法，向四聯總處請款購糧，如果一無準備，而容許大量的難已進入，是會發生嚴重事端的。</p>
<p>新的難民問題</p>
<p>徐州軍政當局安頓義民，都根據中央指示的一個原則，就是義民可向東西北三個方可疏散，但是不能搭津備車南下。現在，徐州每日已有五六百新的難民扺逹。社會部現在撥款十億，麵粉二十三噸，從事救濟和疏導的工作，這襄設有兩個疏導站，義民一到，負責他們食宿之外，另贈三萬至五萬的路費，送他們乘免費車回鄉。如果是無家可歸的，送他們到親戚家裏去暫住。據辦理人員說：難胞之來，大都是希望到京滬區謀生較易之地，現在是辦不到。在目前局面之下，一切是臨時辦法，展本解決實在談不上。</p>
<p>中央之不願難胞南下，自具苦心，因爲今日大江以南的政治經濟心臓區，已不容稍有騷動。在事實上，就業　的機會上言，人地生疏的義民在江南恐怕亦得不到安慰。這裏三十四保的義民，現在已經提出一個自助的辦法，包括設立難民學校，難民市塲，小本貸款合作社，職業介紹所，醫院，戶口統計等七項，呈請徐市軍政機關核準，這是値得社會人士同情的。同時，在另一方面，今日安全地區內的有力人士，亦應勇於助人。他們如果有機會看看這裏義民的苦難，再想想今日整個的大局，就不難覺悟到拉平人與人間的生活距離，是维繫這個社会制度的根本辦法。（本報記者丁維棟）</p>

<h3 id="c179">四四字典 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 亞新</p>
<p>（姚仲拔創編，自刊本，五〇四面，</p>
<p>定價一五〇元）</p>
<p>這部字典，呌做「四四字典」，是什麼意思？在創編祿起上竹說：「編者經研究吾國現代字之組織，認爲所有筆形，均可歸納四類，因以四類筆形爲原則，編製本字典。先以四類筆形分類，再以四類筆形，由類分部；又以四類筆形，順序排列；終以四類筆形次序查字，故名之爲四四字典。』這幾句話，就是它命名的由來了。</p>
<p>在編製說明中，開頭一句話說着：『本字典之編製，以下列四個目標爲範圍：第一應以現代字體之筆形爲分部之標準。第二應規定部首有一定之部位。第三應簡化部首之數目。第四應簡化檢字的筆劃。」現在先把這四點加以討論。</p>
<p>關於第一點，所謂「現代字體」，並非指正楷字，而是指宋體說的。宋體如其說是現代字體，那末正楷算什麼字體呢？這句話似乎有點語病，先應該加以修正。</p>
<p>現代字體（不管宋體或正楷）的筆形，均可歸爲四類，那是對的。所謂四類，就是點（·）橫（一）直（——）撇（丿）。這些並非姚氏的創製。按我國舊排檢法里，早已有人用過江山千古（即，—丿一），元亨利貞（即一，丿—）等的了。而新法之中把寒來署往（即，一—丿）的起笨，作爲筆形的範疇，也巳不乏其例。</p>
<p>其實，筆形實際上的種類，並非只有點橫直撇四者。姚氏歸納的方法，以變態，分離，不論三者爲原則。如趣（丿）爲橫（一）之變態，捺（　）爲點（·）之變態，以捺入點類，　入橫類，即採取第一原則歸納的。又如一乃」字，照習慣作三筆，這里作爲　直橫直撇，即採取第二原則歸納的。鈎筆如一丁」字第二筆之鈎，不作筆形，即採取第三原則歸納的。看了這部字典內的筆形歸類表，更可以明白。不過把「上」一止」字第二筆短橫，歸入點類里，覺得與實際不合。把連合的一灣」筆，一種分離，這非常合乎科學的條例，但與習慣上，究有些不適。姚氏說『鈎筆不作筆形，蓋於編排無關』，試間「干」與「于」相遇，僅差一鈎，難道於編排眞的無關嗎？要是認承鈎筆不論的原則，那末直鈎橫鈎應該一視同仁。可是一宀一與「疋」的橫鈎均作撇類，這豈非自相矛盾嗎？因此，筆形的歸類及其取捨尚有商討的餘地。</p>
<p>關於第二點，舊有部首法中部首的部位，沒有一定，或左或右，或上或下，或中或外，令人難於提摸，引起反感，勢所必然。這里，除掉「乏」「冂」「鬥」「門」及「勹」爲例外外，均以「上」「左」「左上角」的三個部位爲部首。這樣的規定，誰都焚同。</p>
<p>不過規定部首的部位，並未解決部首中的一切問題。因爲部首除掉在一字的部位外，還有組織和結構等的特質。要把這問題弄淸，須涉及上面所提的第三點。茲爲行文方便意見，併入下節來討論。</p>
<p>關於第三點，簡化部首的數目，已由二百十四個减爲九十個。姚氏用什麼方法簡化的呢？是以採併　部和添設新部兩種方法來簡化的。所　「採」，是指採用舊部首而言，例如「氵」「雨一「門」「竹」等即是。所謂「併」，是指併合舊部首而（目，例如「立」之拼入「　」，「走」之併人「土」，『曰」之併入「日」，「月」之併入『月』等即是。所謂「添設新部」，是指一」「主」「业」「×」等的新設而言，統計九十個部首，舊有者爲七十五，新增爲十五。從這點上看，這部字典可說是一種改良部首法的字典。</p>
<p>部首的優點之一，在它稱謂的清楚和與其部尾關係的明晰。例如李字之判爲「木」「子」，陳字之判爲「卩」「東」，婦孺皆知。康熙字典二百十四個部首，個個有其音義，但在這部字典里，有許多新部首，是然以名之的。例如「　」「　」「一」「人」「亻」「鳥」「」等即是，而且這些部首中所收的字，其部首與部尾的關係，無明晰的界限。例如我們說「弓長」張，是多末淸楚，而現在却把張字歸入「　」部，其餘的部尾「張」，算什麼東西呢？</p>
<p>再，一個部首，究竟以包含多少字爲適宜？這不能以主觀的好惡來定奪，當以客觀的需要爲　衡的。從統計上來說，這里九十個部首，共包含九千六百九十字，平均每個部首約一百七十六字。但實際上的分配是：</p>
<p>字數　部數</p>
<p>1—50　33</p>
<p>51—100　22</p>
<p>101—150　20</p>
<p>151—200　5</p>
<p>201—250　2</p>
<p>251—300　2</p>
<p>301—350　1</p>
<p>351—400　1</p>
<p>401—450　1</p>
<p>451—500　1</p>
<p>其中最少的爲「鬥」部，只有七個字；最多的爲「氵」部，有五五三個。假使七個字就可建立一個部首，那末包含七個字以上而部首與部尾確有顯著的形體，如「方」「豕」「卄」「廴」「虍」「缶」「矢」「角」「身」「鬼」等，爲什麼不替它們立爲部首呢？</p>
<p>此外不能分判而全字筆劃互相串插或接連的整字，如「事」字，從前人「亅」部，現在入「十」部，「果」字從前入「木」部，現在入「田」部，「年」字從前入「千」部，現在入「人」部，「甘」從前是部首，現在在入「卄」部，比較起來，除掉「年」字歸部進步一些外，其他還不是五十步笑百步嗎？</p>
<p>關於第四點應簡化檢字的筆劃方面，姚氏只分爲點產直撇而不把歸入這四類的其他筆形排成次序，實在不够嚴密。再在同類或同部首的字，其次序只論四筆而不論四筆以後的筆形，也覺得太爲「四」字所束縛了。例如在點類部百之中，「冫」部的排在「　」部之前，即爲前例。又如直類部首之「門口足日目貝口」七部的次序，只顧前四筆而形成錯亂的現象，就是後例。</p>
<p>另外還有一點，須提一提的，那就是筆順的問題。照普通的條例，是以自上至下，自左至右爲原則。「竹」字在這字典之中是歸入「」部，那末「竹」字的筆順，是—一一—丿一—，毫無疑義。以此類推，「竹」部的筆順當然是　一　一了。不過在丿類部首中，「竹」反排「人」之後，這是什麼理由呢？至於其他各字第一筆有兩歧時，用重兌之例，那是很對的。姚氏說：</p>
<p>然而一部字典的好壞，並非只靠檢查的便利，就可決定。此外，還要顧到字　是否豐富，解釋是否適時。論這部字典的字彙，除三十七個祗作部首外，共錄九千六百五十三字。這些字以何爲根據，姚氏並未設明，但從用用作電報一點看，大概是依其一電報號碼書爲準的。其中常用字諒已收入了。</p>
<p>總之，這部字字典，可取的地方，字彙尚稱豐富，解釋還算適時，至於排檢上，却未能達到「便查」的境界，希望姚氏再加　正改善，將來未始沒有出路。</p>
<h3 id="c180">西洋潮流 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 榮菊珍</p>
<p>最近在一本雜誌上看到一篇評論蔣夢麟先生近著「西洋潮流」的文章。該書原名「＂Tides　from　the　West＂」由耶魯大學出版·茲將評論的大意，介紹如左。</p>
<p>蔣夢麟博士寫作此書，究竟以教育家的態度，澴是以政治家的態度，我們很難看出來。這是一本用圓熟而又淸新的英語寫成的自傳。他很適當地呌它「西洋潮流」。他生於一八八四年，地點是在距離寗渡不遠的一個村莊裏，那裏交通相當方便，和當時的西方文化中心上海，接觸的機會很多。他在幼年時代，看到了被太平軍破毀的民房，聽到了北平的戊戍政變，更聽到了「新民」的呼聲。</p>
<p>那時候的讀書人的傳統功課是四書五經，蔣先生也受過這種教育，後來　進新法學堂，學習英語，接受西洋文化·他是美國哥倫比亞大學畢學生，會得到哲學博士學位·當時中國的英雄是孫逸仙，梁啓超，蔡元培·蔣先生終於加入了國民黨，爲黨的領袖蔣總裁効忠。中國共產黨認爲他是反動份子，因此他對共產相當憤恨，他批評共產的土地改革政策，認爲這不過是孫總理民生主義　變形而巳。</p>
<p>他對於在上海的中外人民，攻擊得不遺餘力。他以爲上海八太下流，祗要錢，剝削敲詐，無所不爲，是個罪惡的深淵。他拿北平和上海相比，在那裏，他會担任過十五年的國立大學校長，他認爲北平才是眞正的藝術家，哲學家和學者的樂土。對於這個聞名世界的古都，他描寫得很多，讀者在這一章裏一定可以獲得很大的樂趣·這裏是蔣先生最得意的地方。</p>
<p>對於這非常時代的思想革命和社會發展不能完全明瞭的人，來批評這本書似乎不太適當。但是我們總想要看到當時中國局勢的眞相。這樣的要求，一定會感到失望，因爲蔣光生實在寫得太簡略了。</p>
<h3 id="c181">新疆槪述 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 震達</p>
<p>—驌著　獨立出版社印行</p>
<p>新疆一省面積得一七一一九三一方公里，其面積之大冠於全國各省，幾四倍於四川，十六倍於浙江，五十倍於台灣；至於其人口據三十六年七月內政部人口局發表數字得四〇一二三三〇人，僅及全國人口百分之點七，然而沃野地帶則人口密度每方公里可達三百餘人。惟全省資源未盡開發，故新疆未來之建設前途，吾人實不可忽視，但建設又須明白地理環境，否則南轅北轍，格格不入：丁嘯教投新扭概述一書，實可作爲一極佳之參考書也。故不揣　陋，爲之介紹也。</p>
<p>此書爲作者卅二年五月至十月於新疆旅行考察所得；行程所經遍歷天山南北，經凡四十二縣，新疆重要之地，均已包括在內，名之新疆概述，名符其實。</p>
<p>此書共九四頁分十二章，第一章爲行政區劃，依據迪化伊犂塔城阿山哈密焉耆喀什阿克蘇莎車和閩十行政區分述之。</p>
<p>第二章述新疆之而積及人口，新疆面積約占全國面積七分之一，惟其人口極少，平均每方公里人口密度僅三人，但沃野耕地帶，則密度可達每方公里三五八人；職業分配農人約占百分之三十五至四十，牧民約百分之二十。人口分佈則南部多而北部少。</p>
<p>第三章爲自然區劃，常人分新疆自然區爲北疆及南疆，惟此種分劃則忽略天山阿爾泰山及崑崙山；作者依據地勢地質構造，將新疆自然區分劃成六區廿副區。</p>
<p>一北部山原區——甲阿爾泰山地乙布爾根高原丙布魯津平原丁塔城高原。</p>
<p>二北疆盆地——甲綏來盆地乙艾比湖平原。</p>
<p>三天山山地——甲天山乙伊犂平原丙鎭西盆地丁吐魯番盆地戊拜城盆地已烏什平原。</p>
<p>四南疆盆地——塔里木盆地。</p>
<p>五北山區——甲星星峽高原乙白能堆高原丙庫魯塔克丁馬耆盆地。</p>
<p>六崑崙山地區——甲崑崙山脈乙帕米爾高原丙藏北高原。</p>
<p>第四章爲氣候，新疆位於中亞大陸，氣候爲大陸性，北部略爲潤濕，南部沙漠則異常乾燥也。此章之下又分溫度降水量濕度雲量風沙彈日諸項述之。</p>
<p>第五章爲地質鑛產，新疆之二盆地均爲古代之天陸，古生代初期天山阿爾泰崑崙諸山均爲海洋，後加里多寗造山運動時，阿爾泰山隆起於北，古生代之末，則崑崙天山又崛起矣。天山崑崙阿爾泰諸山均爲造山運動之影響而成壓擠斷層之山地。其後又因喜馬拉雅運動之影響而使新疆全省爲盆地形狀；而氣候亦因高山之環繞而趨於乾燥。</p>
<p>新疆之鑛產則有鐵煤不油等。作者並於此章之末論及工業建設，謂新疆鑛產均極分散，惟精河鞏哈焉耆庫車所範圍之區，鑛產比較富饒集中，舉凡鐵石油鋅鉛釦諸鑛均有開採價值，雖乏煤，淮鞏哈有水力26萬匹馬力，焉耆有水力16萬匹爲力可資利用，抑且焉耆鞏哈草原廣大，農牧繁盛，且迪化伊犂阿克蘇三農區又極接近，故將來工業之發展舍此區草屬也。此等意見，對建設新疆足資參考。</p>
<p>第六章爲農業，新疆以氣候之關係，北疆雨量稍豐，可耕可牧，惟氣候寒冷，生長期短，故牧重於農，南疆雨量稀少，惟氣候較溫和，生長期較長，農業集中於沃野，藉雪水以資灌溉；作牧以小麥米玉米棉絲水果爲主。</p>
<p>第八章爲手工業，以和　區爲最主，主要工業有絲織洛浦毯玉等。新式工業則以伊犂區爲最</p>
<p>第九至第十一章爲居民，分居民之演變，維吾爾柯爾吉孜哈薩克諸項述之。</p>
<p>第十二章爲新疆移民之可能性，新疆地廣人稀，因此今後建設缺乏者爲人，故建設難於推進也，爲建設計，則須移民，然則移民之可能性竟如何？作者根據水源農地諸方面，估計可移民一千四百萬人；並聲明水利及交通之建設於今後絕對重要。此項移民問題對新疆建設亦有極大之關係，值得吾人注意。</p>
<p>此書之末附有附錄三：爲柯族部落，一爲哈薩克之三部，一爲鐵道計劃，於鐵道計劃中作者計劃擬築三幹綫——蘭州伊寗綫包頭哈密綫蘭州疏附綫。十三支綫——（一）安西婼羌綫，（二）安西庫爾勒綫，（三）哈密庫爾勒綫，（四）迪化庫爾勒綫，（五）迪化塔城綫，（六）迪化阿山綫，（七）鎭西哈密綫，（八）鎭西迪化綫，（九）庫爾勒疏附綫，（十）阿克蘇和闕綫，（十一）庫爾勒喏羌綫，（十二）阿克蘇葉爾羌綫，（十三）鎭西阿山綫。</p>
<p>此書附有表二十七地圖二—行政區域圖及自然區域圖，惟似嫌地圖太少，蓋地理方面之書應圖文並重，不然地圖太少能使讀者覺得不便，此點希望作者能有所補救也。</p>

<p>— 陳從周</p>
<p>（大千居士近作第一集，謝稚柳畫集，玻璃版，成都路中國畫苑經售）</p>
<p>從　戰勝利到現在，出版界在文集方面，雖禾恢復到　前的狀態，然質與量巳達到相當的程度，我們不能不爲　術界慶幸，然而　集呢？正如鳳毛麟角般少得怪可憐，據我知道的，在專集一部份，去年一年祗出版了三五種，加張大　臨撫敦　　　第一集，王个　　集，黃君　　集外，就是最近出版的張師大千　作第一集，　謝稚柳畫集了，因爲二人的作風相同，故爲文一起介紹：</p>
<p>張大千，世人盡知以學石　可以亂眞而鳴海內的，自從到敦煌去後，由　擬元明的筆調，上規　宋，遠追六朝，在戰前　集會出數勘，作風方而自然與今不同，臨撫的　畫只限於人物部份，如今這集共十二幅却包括了山水花鳥人物舉走獸，集中可以看出這數年來在繪事上研究的途徑與取材，他除遠走敦煌外，去年復　進了故宮舊藏北苑瀟湘圖，宋人溪山無盡圖，顧閣中夜宴圖等，這些唐宋名蹟在古書的著錄上，都是犖塋大端，不但眞本不能得，如今張師的臨木又成人間至實了！在　集上我們都能看到，如倣唐畫散花圖，北苑春城疊嶂，韓　夜照白圖，觀之如親對古本，沒有一幅口輕易茍巳從　的，均　筆筆有古人，處處有來歷的作品，印工亦很精工，鑒賞家用作珍藏亦可，美術　校學生用作臨撫亦可，蘭亭眞迹雖不可見，然褚　絹本彌足爲世所重的了！</p>
<p>中大　教授種柳，他在國畫上　詣之深，半由天份，半　学力，武進　氏夙有文名，他哥哥王岑的詩詞，姐姐月眉的　派花島，都是世人畫知的，所以存如此好的環境，方能產生出如此的人才，抗戰中浪跡西北，　張師同去敦煌，觀六朝隋唐壁　後，藝　進，歸而授課白下上庠，在藝術教育中確是以正軌啓後進者，絲毫不受前後海派與西洋畫的影嚮，事　取之於古，他的花鳴法　人，鈎勒與數色之精今時罕有，山水則渾穆靜遠，人物法老蓮而入唐人之室，以這樣功力的人去爲人師，的確是難能的了，可惜他去秋應程滄波氏之聘，離去了中大，這部書集可算作與中大同學留別的紀念品了！集中計十二幅山水人物花鳥無所不包，我最愛秋塘圖，紅樹竹禽，苔枝綴玉，平岡靄霜數幅。</p>
<h3 id="c183">化學原理 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 王乾德</p>
<p>（Principles　of　ChemistryJ．H．Hildebrand原著，曹惠羣編譯，乙西學社叢書之一，中華書局出版）</p>
<p>中國向來是一僩科學落後的國家，所以對於科學方面的著作是很少的，就是關於翻譯方面的也不十分多；這樣一般高中或高中以上的學校，所採用的科學教科書大部分都是西文原本，於是中國的青年學生們就吃虧不少，而且也吃苦不少，因爲他們要把　一半的時問化費到研究語文學上去，所以得到的効果當然不會是百分之百的；在這樣的條件之下，譯述的書確實對中國的前途莫不有密切的關係。</p>
<p>化學原理它除了一部分關於命名的方而是由譯者改編之外，其餘的都是取材於J．H．Hildbrand所著的Principles　of　Chemistry。</p>
<p>這本書一共分爲二十章，每一章所講的都是有着不同的題材；在內容方面說當然無疑的是重於理論方面的東西，而且所講的也都是一些關於普通化學最基本的定律，這些定律也就是學生們最感頭痛的，但是爲什麼使學生們頭痛呢？雖然定律的本身是一個主要的原因，但是對於作書人的筆調也有一個相當的關係。</p>
<p>化學原理它就和普通的化學書絕然不同了，譬如第三童所講的「氣體動力論」（Kinetic　Theory　of　Gases）它不但把一切的氣體通性說得淸淸楚楚，而且把許多與氣體有關的定律用圖的方法，把它完全表達出來，而且把它顯露得一些不遺，使讀者並不感到一絲兒困難與枯燥；如波養耳定律（Boyle＇s　Law），在這章裏就有了二個簡岡來顯示壓力與體積的關係，因爲整個兒波義耳定律所講的也不過是說「當溫度一定時，氣體的體積與壓力成反比」即（PV＝p．v．或V＝Con．tant）。其他還有像「溫度不變時，一種氣體的壓力與其濃度成正比」這一點理論也是在普通的化學書籍上難得覓到的。更好的就是把道爾頓的分壓定律（Dalton’s　Lawof　Partialpressuse）用各種混份的氣體的碰撞器壁的現象來闡明。</p>
<p>第五章「化性物性與原子構造之關係」中把金屬的所以容易傳遞電流，用「因爲在最外圍中有小數電子之元素，均在固態時吸持電子極爲鬆弛」來解說，所謂傳遞電流者，就是電子的互相傳遞。更把電塲對於分子的三種效　用了一張圖把它顯示得很明楚，再加上了一部分的解釋，好就尤其淸楚了。此外還有用原子的構造，來談明酸（Acid）鹽（Salt）及　基（Hycroside）等的不同。</p>
<p>第十五章「氯化與還原」裏，爲了要使讀者很澈底的瞭解還原劑（Redueing　Agent）與氧化劑（Oxidizing　Agent），之不同，而舉了好多個化学反應式來闡明這一點，對於這種不怕麻煩的精神，專爲讀者着想的精神，也就是這本書最大的特點。</p>
<p>此外關於「原子之組織」，「分子構造」，「元素之週期系」以及「平衡之種類」裏也有許多不可多得的材斜。</p>
<p>總之凡是你對於化學有興趣的話，那你就得必讀此書。</p>
<p>以上所說的都是這本書的優點，但可惜的化學原理還有一個小小的缺點，就是在翻譯的言詞方面尚夾帶了一些文言，雖然文言的句子是比較簡短，不過科學方面的譯著最好能用白話，這也是我對化學原理的一點小批評。</p>
<p>最後再來把乙酉學社的歷史簡短的介紹一下，因爲化學原理是乙酉學社叢書的一份子；乙酉學社的成立在民國卅四年之初，是一般有名望的科學家所組織的，因爲在當時他們不願屈服敵寇，也不願白白的浪費了賽貴的光陰，所以就編譯了許多西洋科學的名教本，以便將來爲復興教育之基礎。現在第一集恐怕己經出齊了，這一集一共有物理，化學，數學等三種共十餘册；如果各位須要知道更多或更詳細的話可以參閱本月四日大公報出版界袁良先生所作的「歲寒譯書記」。</p>
<h3 id="c184">讀「幽谷百合」 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 陸菲瓊</p>
<p>巴爾札克著　高名凱譯　海燕書店版</p>
<p>你囑我爲「幽谷百合」寫一篇書評，而且你還提出條件說：「和創作一樣，書評的形式與內容是應和諧一致的。」這我可不能照辦，當我讀到一本好書時，我雖不自禁地想把它介紹給別人，然而我却常常寫不出什麼來；我雖想得很多，但寫得極少。我雖被作者的智慧所迷惑，但我却只能報之以一大篇空洞的贊許，如「細膩」，「深刻」，「用詞佳妙」等等；就是此刻吧，我不敢說我是在寫書評，我只是低低地想告訴你；「我要爲莫爾梭夫夫人控訴！」也許人們會接受我的控訴的，因爲我多少也還深信女字能使人心與人心相通，把人與人之間的距離縮短，是不是呢？你說。</p>
<p>從小，巴爾札克就很少受到他人的愛撫，他的父親與母親對他總是冷峻嚴肅的；而且在外表上說，他並不令人歡喜，他身材的高和闊，他穿的衣服奢艷得令人壓惡，他在酒席上的態度既粗野又下流。他是孤獨的，但他又不甘於寂寞，他終身抱着一個慾望——「求爲人鍾愛」。</p>
<p>「求爲人鍾愛」的慾望主宰了他的一生，他需要一例安慰者，一個監護的天使，一個母親，一個情人。</p>
<p>於是，他在彼乃夫人身上找到了他的幻想。</p>
<p>波乃夫人是第一個眞正認識他的天才的女人，是眞正第一個栽培他，鼓舞他的人，但是當巴爾札克在文壇上登峯造檢的時候，她却已是一個龍鍾老婦了。在她臨終時，她給他一封動人棚短的信：「我可以死了，我可以斷定你的頭上已經戴上我希望你戴的那頂冠冕了！」巴爾札克對於守護着他十四年的天使也會這樣回覆道：「她是一朶孤獨的花，世界沒有注意過她，她曾經做着我的明星。」</p>
<p>這朶孤獨的花就是「幽谷百合」。</p>
<p>當莫爾梭夫夫人枯守着她底山谷中的別宮，週旋於她底兒女和精神失常的丈夫之間時，她突然感染到了一個意外的光輝，那就是她接待了一個孩子，一個爲着需要母愛而傾向於她的十七歲的孩子，同時，爲了相似的理由，她接受了這雙伸過來的手。</p>
<p>「只有一個女子最後的愛才能滿足一個男子的最初的愛。」這一類愛情的深度是無可揣測的；「這位女人永遠不會想到自己，只是想到你，她不會跟你有什麼爭執，她不會聞問她自己的利益，她會爲你而察知你自己一點兒也沒有看到的危險，然而却忘記了自己的危險，最後，如果她苦痛的話，她也不會埋怨，她不會有絲亳的謟媚，但是她對於你所愛於她的却有一個尊重的態度。」（巴爾札克語）</p>
<p>世態的了解，心境的成熟，在在都使莫爾梭夫夫人的愛戀日趨「神化」。年輕女人的愛情是自私的，她們只愛自己（甚至愛她們自己的幻想），她們要你貢獻出整個生命爲她所有，她們要得到你，跟隨你，眞如你是她自己的影子。然而，一個中年婦人的愛情却是無條件的，她們只要求你一刻時間，一句話，一道眼色，一個音調，一個表面上看過去很輕微的注意，她們並不想在肉體上佔有你，她們只願昏睡在你底心靈深處。</p>
<p>「被人所愛，被人所了解，這是　一個最大的幸福」。可惜這種幸福並不持久，當靑年掙上翅膀的時候，他飛了，他被另一種愛撫所壘惑，於是這朶孤獨的百合花也就在「過份深情」中開始鬱鬱枯萎。</p>
<p>一個習慣於抑制情緒女人，在克服痛苦時一定覺得比服侍德性來很容易，她能在大痛苦中昂起頭來，她却不能讓愛情在刑律和德性之前低頭。莫爾梭夫夫人也是這樣，她是母親，也是莫爾梭夫伯爵合法的妻子，爲了道義上她有守貞的義務，她不得不吞下自己的痛苦做一個「賢妻良母」。然而，「思想是不能自制的」，愛情的飢渴更能燒毀了她底身心，當她臨死時，她又懊悔無已了：「一個人該活在眞實之中，而不是活在欺騙之內，我的生命的一切都是欺騙，這幾天以來，我曾經計算過這些騙術的回數，我這個沒有眞正生活過，我這個從來沒有到野地去找渦什麼人的女人，我能够這樣的死去嗎」？</p>
<p>「我能够這樣的死去嗎」？可憐這朶幽谷中的野百合，她一生的命運就拘束在金戒指所給女人套上的「重鍊」之內了。</p>
<p>悄悄地生長，默默地在幽谷中含苞待放，寂寞地渡過了她的豐盛的青春之後，她有了一個燦爛的夏季。然而爲了她還眷戀着昔日山谷中的淒寒，她不敢在陽光下任性接受激情的愛撫，她寗願在晚上做天空中閃爍的屋星。沒有人知道她，沒有人整個的認識這個女人的偉大的生命，也沒有人敢於走遍她的靈魂的整個的領域。</p>
<p>在一切「埋葬幽蘭，灌溉薔薇」的人們之前，我要爲　爾梭夫夫人控訴。</p>

<p>— 白永</p>
<p>先生在文學雜誌所發表的連續長篇「莫須有先生坐飛機以後」是他在抗戰時期生活的自敘傳，因爲他的文章素以晦澀著名，近來又充滿佛學的氣息，自然不爲目下一般靑年所愛好，所以，恐怕看看這篇文字的人不多，其實這篇小說的作風已是與前大不相同，像「棗」「橋」及「莫須有先生傳一那樣難懂的意境與辭句，是很少見了，一方面或是作者本身作風之改變，一方面也因爲作者所記的生活，都是教小學或中學的日子，要艱深也無從的。</p>
<p>在這裏最引我們注意的就是他對於中國文學和寫作態度與技巧的看法，作者一向是屬於「言志派」陣營的，主張自我的抒寫，不可落於公式主義的空喊，本文好像仍舊繼續這個態度，譬如說：</p>
<p>「……無論英國的莎士比亞，無論中國的庾子山，詩人自己好比是春天，或者秋天，於是世界便是題材，好比是各樣花木，一碰到春天便開花了，所謂萬紫千紅總是春，或者一葉落天下知秋。我讀莎士比亞讀庾子山，只認得一個詩人，處處是這個詩人自己表現，不過莎士比亞是以故事人物來表現自己，中國詩人則是以辭藻典故來表現自己，一個表現於生活，一個表現於意境。……」</p>
<p>抱了這個態度來衡量作品，自然有許多不對了，即如韓退之的文章是作古文的一唱三嘆的，但作者却批評他的「送董邵南遊河北序」爲空洞，沒有感情，沒有意思，也就是毫無材料。又王安石的「讀孟嘗君傳」也是如此，而且古代公子所養的士，還不就是鷄鳴狗盜？爲什麼要說「谿鳴狗盜之出其門，此士之所以不至也」這種沒常識的話呢？本來這也是言志派的老調了，可是細想中國過去的文人議論，大概都是如此，坐在家裏亂講天下事，對與不對，完全不相干。或者專門說廢話，如贈序或碑銘之類，豈唯諂諛而已，節直等於在紙上胡扯。只是這裘舉的送董邵南序，不很恰當，韩文中之空洞無物者，絕不是此篇，若以通行的贈序而論，我覺得『送高閑上人序」等篇比這篇要空泛得多。唐代自安史亂後，河北諸鎭，表面降順了中央，實際上是獨立局而，可以說安祿山的系統始終存在，故韓氏諷刺董君，因不得忘於有　，而「鬱鬱適茲土」，那也就是「之胡之越」的意思，其中頗有含蓄，豈能謂爲沒意思呢？（近人陳寅恪論唐代中葉以後政局，亦引此爲證）至韓氏「諛墓一之文，自古詬病，那才眞是空洞的代表。這裏應該注意的便是，無論空洞也罷，眞實也罷，中國文人的大病即是在極力要求「大處洛墨」，不但小題目不肯做，即使育，也得「小題大作」，才够　上作文三味。所謂大者，無非是社棱君王，生拉硬扯。把自己的帽子，往別人頭上戴，例如一武　非忠臣子胥非孝子一之類的違反人情的話，一山是觀之，其緊於國家興亡豈不大哉」之類的公式套語，看了不令人頭疼，就令人作嘔。彷彿一天到晚非頭腦裏裝滿這些問題不可似的，至於飲食男女，睡覺結婚，人類日日不可離者，反而沒有人去談他，就是讀了，也必為人痛罵，如李笠翁金聖嘆諸人，即是其例。我們固然不必提倡人人都作袁中郎的小品，然而亦不必天天朗誦原道，則彰彰明甚。這一傳統的流行，並不是至今而斬，我們看看今日學生的作文，十之八九是「光陰過得這樣快，春又降臨到人間了一「中國像這樣，怎麼會强呢」等等，此與從前的「人生天地之間」，乃是一脈之傳，吳世昌君已在去年的觀察上罵過的了，可是其所以不能改良者，仍　由於耳　目染全是嘩啦嘩啦的來西，要不便是充滿了某腔某調的套子，於是使青年人炎失了表現自我的胆量與動機，他們曾未想想如何說自己要說的話，而是無論何等題目，都巳有了一個公式等在前面，不論千篇一律，即使年年爲之，日日爲之，也莫不如此。廢名在他的文章中，稱此爲八股精神，他曾給學生命題曰「楓樹」，一生作了「我的窗前有兩棵樹，一棵是楓樹，還有一棵，也是楓樹。」初看很以爲這學生不平凡，後來又看到一個学生，其起筆亦如是，乃至第三第四，無不如是，才恍然大悟是學了發迅秋夜；「我後園中有兩棵樹，一棵是棗樹，還有一棵，也是棗樹」的套子，立刻氣得他面紅耳赤，把學生大駡一頓：「你們爲什麼不說自己的話，却專來抄人家的？」這恐怕是任何教中等學校國文的先生都有過的經驗，其實，能够模仿這種造句的已算好的了，大多數還是弄不來的，他們所會的只是一套空而又空的傳統，隨你出什麼題目，都會裝了上去，每一個頭腦，好像都不曾有生活經驗—即使是非常的簡單—的影子，他們在紙上所說的，和他們眞正要說的，完全不同，假設新文藝照這樣下去，縱使有一二個成名的作家，幾十部成名的作品，又有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>偉大的空洞，沒有一個眞實可以塡塞他！</p>

<p>美國參議院在動了不知多少唇舌之後，終於通過了援歐案第一年所需的金額，計五十三億美元。但是，美國政府在一九四七年一年中所徴收的酒稅（包括中央及地方的稅收）一項，總額已逾四十億美元，換言之，美國平均每一家人家在去年一年中付了一百十五美元的酒稅。</p>

<h3 id="c187">雜論是非 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>一個人，總得有一個信念，那就是世界上一定有眞理存在。要塡平大海易，而要埋沒眞理却是歷史上永遠找不到先例的難事。無論賣弄什麼「此亦一是非，彼亦一是非」，「是非相對」，「無是無非」這一套玄之又玄的「哲學」，却永遠不能否定是非的存在。</p>
<p>任何人做任何事，都應該爲求是而發，是的便是是的，非的就是非的，決沒有似是而非亦是亦非的理由，孔子所謂早聞道夕死可矣者，就是說，明白是非之後，雖爲求是而犧牲也不足懼的大智者語，這種淸楚的觀察和言論，相隔縱有數千年，而它的價值不變者也就是爲了它包含的意義正是眞理的緣故。反之，一般落意混淆是非顛倒黑白的事或話，雖從聽聞於一時，可是經不多久，便就無影無跡地消滅掉了。</p>
<p>明白了是非還不够，應該去非存是，敢於和「非」爭戰，使「是」的光芒不被陰霧所蔽，消極地去除壞的，就等於積極地建立好的，「破壞即是建設。」中山先生便會這樣說過。因爲不把舊的剷除，新的就不能建設，不把「非」去掉，「是」也將被它所遮掩了。譬如說一個人有浪費金錢的惡習，假使不把這惡習去掉，只是設法讓他多掙些錢，但是儘管錢掙的多，浪費却是沒有限止的，這個人便也永遠積不起一個小錢，唯有把浪費的惡習改正，才能够談到多增加生產的問題。</p>
<p>我想道個世界所以如此冷漠者，也許就是爲了缺少愛是惡非的熱情，人應該有所愛，也有所恨，如果沒有了恨，也就無所用其愛，愈是有愛人精神的偉人，對於少數爲非作歹的也愈痛恨。中國人不幸中了「是非只爲多開口」的毒，便缺少敢於是其所是非其所非的勇氣，所以特別在中國，是非幾乎是難於辨認的東西，因之也就有人懷疑到是非存在的究竟。</p>
<p>人類中決沒有所謂超人，所以不可能一個人所言所行都是，另一個人所言所行都非，但這決不是說天下就此沒有了是非，是非的存在是對事的而不是對人的，往往你的是就是我的非，而我的是也就是你的非，人與人之間能够不以爲自己一身都是眞理，開誠相見，互補不足，眞理也就不難大白。如果諱疾忌醫，怕人批評自已的不是，那就違反了眞理，甘於爲非作歹而不忌了。</p>
<h3 id="c188">梁任公初謁康南海 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 危之</p>
<p>梁任公在中國文壇整整的活躍了三十年，影響後人至大，鄭振鐸先生曾在「中國文學論集」中</p>
<p>一再稱道。作爲散文作家說，他曾掃蕩了當時懨懨無生氣的所謂　城又　；作爲政治家說，戍戌政變以後，他也造成了一種風氣，引導了一大羣人同走，作爲新聞記者說，他是一個極有成就評論撰述者，他的治學勞績不在於有深湛的研究，而在於他將他的學問通俗化，普遍化地顯示給衆人。</p>
<p>任公之學識，最初無疑地頗受康有爲（南海）之影響。雖然自辛亥革命以後，他們兩人的道路已頗不同，但在最初，任公之得益於南海者頗多，南海亦無異爲彼之啓蒙師。在任公的「三十自述」里，曾有一段話提倒他初謁南海時的情形，頗爲動人，從而亦可想見南海之影嚮任公，　至深且鉅也。</p>
<p>任公之原文如下：</p>
<p>「……於是乃因通甫（即陳千秋）修弟子禮，事南海先生。時余以少年科第，且於時流所推重之訓詁詞學，頗有所知，輒沾沾目喜。先生乃以大海潮音，作獅子吼，取其所挾持之數百年無用舊學，更端駁詰，悉舉而摧陷廓淸之。自辰入見，及戌始退。冷水澆背，當頭一棒，一旦盡失其故壘，惘惘然不知所從事。且驚且喜，且怨且艾，且疑且懼，與通甫聯牀，竟夕不能寐。明日再謁，請爲學方針。先生乃教以陸王心學，而並及史學西學之梗概。自是決然舍去舊學，自退出學海堂，而間日請業南海之門。生平知有學自茲始。」</p>
<p>這段文字寫得極生動懇摯，感情洋溢，亦是任公所寫回憶文之典型的一章也。</p>

<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>余謂酒人另有脾胃，善飲者飲之，其味無窮，不能飲者，點滴入口，則面緋紅，而氣亦喘矣。余吃酒如吃藥，遇友朋酬酢之　，每有慚色，故觀人之善飲者，中心輒羨慕不已。</p>
<p>戰前，大世界旁，有新開店舖，以比賽吃啤酒相號召，當時會有一人吃二十四瓶，不醉，惟腹脹不能再飲。雖云啤酒，然其量之大，亦可概見。余聞先大父言，郡人某（姓名已忘）善飲，居恒食酒汗，（溫州酒中之最厲害者，以黃酒煮鍋中取其上之蒸汽，汽如汗，故名，）多少不論，亦不　。若遇友人招飲，必先以酒精半碗煮熱飲之，然後往，蓋宴會之中，大抵用黃酒，黃酒雖終席頻飲，不能過　也。其酒量之大可知矣。余曾遇朱酒僊於寗波，朱平時可七八斤，若遇猜拳，則十餘斤不　。朱善手戰，故橫行於寗波，號稱無敵。甬上之能酒者，無不知之。然較之古人之能酒者，猶　不啻遠甚。阮吾山茶餘客話載：「江左酒人，推顧俠君（嗣立）第一。居秀野園結社。家有酒器三，大者容三十觔，其兩遞殺，凡入社者，各先盡三器，然後入座，因署其門曰：『酒客過門，延入與三雅，詰朝相見決雌雄，匪是者毋相　。』酒徒望見，慴伏而去，間有鼓勇者，三雅之後，無能爲矣；在京師日，聚同時酒人，分曹較量，亦無敵手；蓋當時方近雯（覲）莊書田（楷）繆湘芷（沅）黎寗先（致遠）皆萬人敵也。」若是，則淳干髡滑稽列傳中之言，不盡無稽也。</p>

<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>店人詩，宋人詞，元人曲，是劃時代的文藝產物。　到文藝，本不罷分時代的，那爲什麼分出時代來呢？因爲當時所出的人才衆多，關於這一門研究極　，大家趨重在這方面，作品既風行一時，自然流傳廣遍，成爲不刊之鉅著，直到幾千百年後，依然傳誦不休，幷且雖然短短的幾旬文詞，不但可以表明當時的人生觀，且可以隱　的透　出當　社會的情形，以及國家之現狀，往往歷史所不能記載的，他們偏能以「感慨　歌」「　吟俯唱」委宛曲折而記述之。唐白香山「長恨歌」，即其一例。</p>
<p>可是元人以後，明淸兩代，就別無所謂代表的文藝了，因爲他們的文藝，是從唐宋元三朝接缺而來的。詩家雖有不少，大抵最高的可以追蹤盛唐，如明之李空同何大復，淸之王漁洋吳梅村諸人。詞家可舉者，則巳鳳毛麟角，歌曲更少，如高明　　記，渴顯　　丹亭，要算當行出色。遜淸作曲人才頗多，尤悔庵　離騷之外，要算洪稗村長生殿最爲著名，當時有「可憐一曲長生殿，斷送功名到白頭」之句。</p>
<p>改革以後，雖有幾許曲本出版，如滄桑艷等，但繼續撰著者，仍舊不多。鄙人所見，有幾篇散曲，可供吟詠。在民國十六年間，當熱楊雲史，作有「如此天涯」一篇，標爲「十年後之旅行，十年前之送別」。茲把他的曲詞，寫　於下：</p>
<p>冷淸淸斜陽古道，打疊起　書一担挑，記當年他送過長亭，又携手銷塊萬里橋。慘離情，金黃寒柳萬千條，一陣陣西風落葉打征袍。說聲去了，車輪兒搖，馬鞭兒敲，那時節魂靈兒都驚上雲霄。（右一）一路的野花兒如容貌，遠山兒似眉梢，不容你淚珠不拋。這其間萬遍迴腸，描不盡的傷心稿。猛回頭，路程兒十里遙，看不見柳邊人歇影兒招，只見那寒　流水孤城小。（右二）河梁過了，投荒村宿一脊，昨夜是　樓人語紅燈笑，今夜是野店關山星月高。也不知鞍馬辛勞，只別恨攢心似剪刀，咳！這愁滋味沒法消。來一壺濁酒，細把腸兒慢慢澆。（右三）問雲台百尺，有幾位鬥容貌。悔當年投筆從軍意氣豪，說戎馬書生功業好，何曾見閨中少婦封侯婿，只看見無定河邊戰骨高。到如今，鐵戟沈沙勳業銷，只贏得孤負香衾人已老，何况深深玉骨埋花草，已然是幽塚黃昏魂歸杳，這心頭長恨怎煎熬！（右四）本來是錦簇花幽珠圍又翠繞，我拋撇了溫柔鄉安樂窩，換了這破碎山河，馬背船梢。說什麼曉風殘月詩情悄，無非是古壘寒雲草木凋。問好光陰一寸金多少？爲誰何作踐的不值半文鈔！恨當初雄心英氣一身包，誤入了邯鄲廟，這負人負己生離死別沒開交，枕頭邊淚盡羅巾誰知嘵！（右五）終年是　　天。自理料，更無人送登程　　　，孤　獨宿確相弔，久不聞健飯添衣　　叨，誰問我冷暖和饑飽。從前是楊柳風神張緒好，如今呵糟蹋得潘　　絲沈瘦腰。（右六）最難堪風霜一路飄，水村山店關門早，展衾裯猶有餘香裊，沒奈何淺醉閒眠，胡亂和衣倒，長吁短歎，咬牙兒挨過這殘宵。斷腸人夜夜何曾睡着覺，只天天開眼到明朝。唉！又到了千山落日鷄聲呌。（右七）</p>
<p>他那「一往情深纏綿不已」的音調，足以使讚者盪氣迴陽。還有一個杭州陳蝶仙，別號「天　　生」的，他　逢倭亂，由杭州避往雲南，作了一　夢江南曲，也把他的曲詞，寫列於下：</p>
<p>（新水令）乘風飛過蜀山頭，竟來作天南遯叟，逃秦三窟外，行李一齊丟，著甚來由，過天涯兀自團團走。（嬾盡　）回想西泠水邊樓，日日風簾捲上鈎，兩峯眉黛總含羞，雙　匿笑屛山後，鏡裘波光玉樣柔。（山坡羊）只管喜孜孜六橋載酒，醉醺醺三竺尋幽，嫩央央打槳中流，愛平湖夜月常如畫，春復秋，歲星三五週，門前種柳，綠上樓窗口。都</p>
<p>是　　舊宅，淸照妝樓，優　，終日裏詩和酒，溫柔，到處是花和柳。（雁兒落帶得勝令）誰料得去年秋，赤緊地烽烟淡，迎朝警報吼如牛，驀生地飛來靈駕，呀，亂離中有多少鳳鸞儔，都做了分飛的勞燕流。想不到天保佑，俺四散的　一家人，幽聚在南屛後，歸休，準備着五湖舟，勾留，把杭州作汴州。（僥僥令）全家拼殉難，舉宅了無愁，倒落得湖莊添築防空室，審閣同期枕首邱。（沽美酒帶太平令）是何人抱杞憂？是何人抱杞憂？疾忙中，催人走，便斗換星移谷自謀。眼看阒，急匆匆的行雲出岫，亂紛紛的決水分流，飛升了淮南　狗，遣散了花　彌猴，俺呀，似人問貸　，獨自　留，呀，只怕牽絲傀儡難長久。（川撥棹）勘破了生死關頭，如來支解原能受。任他們去休，俺何妨死守，而况是桃源生壙先成就。（鴛鴦煞）誰知水盡山窮後，偏有雷車一輛迎門候，似夢初醒，身入定，轉輪迴，只算是趁餘年，娛晚景，作天　。半年來家山回首，禍福原來出自求，任華屋，變荒邱，俺早說四大皆空無所有。</p>
<p>他們兩家作品，都包含着一種眞實的情感，卓越的音調，美妙的結構，誠然是可以接跡元人，可惜所傳不多，尚未能滿足後來者之欣賞。記得三十年前，曾爲誦芬堂主人，校刋一種　天　曲本，係謙牧堂藏書，　有雙調新水令：「二十年參透死生關，漏籍了黑鄧都鬼神公案喚龍歸魯海，騎虎下青山，跳出塵實，從今後再無忠。」又駐馬聽云：「千歲容顏，玉液黃芽九轉丹，半生虛幻，風燈石火萬重灘，是非門闊似海波瀾，利名塲險似連雲棧，從今後再休干，常是子夜深朝斗移香案。「眞是高唱入雲，可以稱得　曲的絕調。鄙人希望　曲家加以深刻的研究，多多創製佳妙的曲本，不使元人載譽於空前。</p>

<p>綺紈心裏雖不痛快，一時只藏在心裏，並不說出。因爲既到上海，便須去見他母親，便邀島雲同去，島雲却推諉事情忙，須把一切布置好了，再能去叩見岳母。綺紈見他所說的話，出乎情理之外，很想駁他幾句，硬拉他同去，後來一想不如自己先去叩見母親，把經過情形說明，免得事情來的突兀，反呌老人驚怪，也未嘗不好。當下趁島雲外出，僱一個車趕到明德里，她母親顧柳如見綺紈突然來到上海，好似天上掉下明月，投到懷抱裏，攬着綺紈問長問短，說：「看報紙登載你服毒自殺消息，我非常不放心，寫兩封信給你，沒有回信，寫信給你哥哥，也沒有回信。後來有朋友告訴我，這些都是論言，我也想到果然有個不好消息，家裏一定有信來，今夭你來了，我眞是高興不過。」綺紈聽了，知道服毒消息，巳然傳到上海，消息來的眞快，因把以往經過情形，略述一遍。柳如聽到綺紈和島雲結婚，不由吃了一驚，問道：「你怎麼會和島雲結婚？這人我認得。」綺紈道：「他也說認得母親。我爲他有相當的財產，人也蘊籍和靄，一切脾氣都很相投。」柳如把頭搖一搖道：「這人外表長得不錯，一切交際也都很好，祗是性情是靠不住的，至說他有相當財產，我可沒聽說過。這事你辦的太魯莽了。」綺紈聽了，不由一呆。柳如道：「我雖然這樣說，事情已辦到這地步，你也不必後悔，他說上海和香港都有財產，這是瞞不了人的，只要我們一調查就知道，並且你可以用種種方法試揆他呀。」綺紈道：「他一到上海，就把我寄住中東飯店，我心裏就可疑，他上海有家，爲什麼不逕回家裏去；要住飯店，也得住一家體面大飯店，只這一點，我心裏就十分不痛快。」柳如道：「你明天邀他同來好了，他說徴求藝員以及製片等等，祗要我和他談談，就知道他的細底，你也不用急，好在你已經來上海，我在這裏，自有辦法。」說着又安慰一回，留着綺紈用過晚飯，才呌她回去。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Truman Explains the World Situation: Points Out Soviet Obstruction of Peace; Demands the United States Implement Universal Military Training <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 17th (Broadcast), Washington Dispatch: President Truman attended a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on the 17th, reporting on the serious situation in the world and making important statements on foreign policy. He pointed out that the emergency situation in Europe was caused by the cruel and ruthless actions of the Soviet Union. He urged Congress to pass the Universal Military Training Act and expedite the passage of the Marshall Plan for European Aid. In addition, he also requested Congress to fully support the newly formed alliance treaty of the five Western European nations to prevent any attack. He said: "The situation in the world today is not primarily due to the consequences of war. The main reason is that one country not only refuses to cooperate in creating a just and honorable peace, but also tries to obstruct it, brewing unrest." Regarding the five-nation alliance in Western Europe, the President stated: "I firmly believe that the United States will support free nations in an appropriate manner, depending on the needs of the situation. I am confident that since the free nations of Europe are determined to ensure their freedom, the United States will not lag behind and will fully support them to achieve this goal." The President further stated: "The latest developments in Europe have presented the United States with a problem of fundamental importance. At this time, action is of utmost importance and should not be hesitated, even though action inevitably involves risk." He emphasized that the United States will continue to support the United Nations organization and will try every method to achieve international coordination. He said: "In recent years, conferences held by various countries have drafted various agreements, based on which a just peace could have been achieved, but these agreements have been ignored and violated by one country. That country not only constantly obstructs the work of the United Nations, frequently using its veto power, but also uses various means to undermine the independence and democratic character of many countries in Eastern and Central Europe. However, not satisfied with this, it obviously intends to apply these methods to the currently free countries of Europe. The seriousness of the situation in Europe lies here. The tragic death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk has shocked the civilized world. At present, Finland is under pressure, and the future of the entire Scandinavian Peninsula is uncertain. Greece is under direct military attack by rebels. In Italy, a Communist minority is seeking to control the country. The United States should implement universal military training to maintain peace with strength. This action will be a great encouragement to other governments that are working to prevent communism." He believes that the Senate's passage of the European Recovery Program is a clear example of the effectiveness of democratic politics. Although the President strongly criticized the Soviet Union, he emphasized that the United States is willing to cooperate with all countries to achieve international understanding. The United States welcomes any country, whether it be the Soviet Union or other governments, that is willing to sincerely cooperate to maintain peace, and the door to cooperation remains open.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the incident of the Sun Namin Civil Aviation Transport Brigade's aircraft being attacked by Soviet aircraft in the Bohai Sea, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lodge another serious protest against the Soviet side's response of the 13th. This note will be submitted to the Soviet side within days, reiterating that civil aviation enterprises' aircraft permitted by the Chinese government in China's territorial airspace should be safe and free. According to the agreement on Lushunkou in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, although it is stipulated that the Soviet Union has the right to station land, sea, and air forces in the naval base area, its task is only to protect the base and strengthen the security of China and the Soviet Union to prevent Japan from invading again. Therefore, the Soviet aircraft in Lushun invading the Bohai territorial airspace and harming passing aircraft has obviously exceeded the scope allowed by the agreement. Our side will demand that the Soviet side guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. At the same time,</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Governor Zhang Jia'ao of the National Bank returned to Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of the 16th. He told reporters yesterday: (1) The case of stabilizing the currency value, which was passed by the State Council, has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for research. Measures have been drafted and will be studied in detail by the Executive Yuan and various competent authorities. The State Council decided to hand over the assets of state-owned enterprises worth more than 400 million US dollars to the Central Bank as a legal tender reserve. These assets include four types: China Textile Corporation, China Merchants Bureau, Resources Committee, and Japanese compensation materials. Whether to adopt a direct sale method or issue stocks has not been decided. We are currently soliciting opinions from all parties. (2) The method of exchanging Northeast circulation certificates issued by the Ministry of Finance was adopted by the Northeast Petition Delegation. The exchange rate between the legal tender and the circulation certificates entering the customs is one to ten. The people in the Northeast do not suffer a loss. The exchange is extremely convenient. Once decided, it will not be easily changed. (3) After the conclusion of the Sino-Australian and Sino-Hong Kong agreements, smuggling in southern China will definitely be reduced.

<h3 id="e23">Levying Special Relief Donations is a Semi-Compulsory Method <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Xian Guang Talks to Reporters</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Director Dong Xianguang answered reporters' questions at a press conference on the 17th as follows;</p>
<p>Question: Is the decree on special relief donations implemented uniformly for both Chinese and foreigners?</p>
<p>Answer: Special relief donation is a temporary donation, not a tax, and only applies to Chinese people (including overseas Chinese) and does not apply to foreigners in China.</p>
<p>Question: What standards will be used when estimating the property value of special donation objects?</p>
<p>Answer: Since special relief donation is not a tax, the estimation of the property of the donor and the determination of the amount of the donation cannot be calculated according to the method of collecting taxes based on accurate investigations and legal standards, but the fundraising committee in each district will use their knowledge and local recognized wealth to persuade them to recognize the amount of the donation. The amount to be donated is equal to one-tenth of the family property for natural persons and one-twentieth of the assets for legal persons.</p>
<p>Question: What are the donation standards for legal persons and individuals who own real estate (factories, real estate, land, raw materials, production finished products, etc.)?</p>
<p>Answer: The regulations for the payment and disposal of in-kind special relief donations stipulate that the price of various in-kind items (real estate and movable property) should be evaluated based on the average price within one month from the date of notification of the approved donation amount. This evaluation work is composed of representatives from public opinion organs, courts, and land administration agencies.</p>
<p>Question: When implementing fundraising, what will happen if those who are indeed capable of donating delay or refuse to donate? How will the refusal to pay the donation be dealt with? Is the donation based on a voluntary or semi-voluntary method?</p>

The Ministry of Finance has responded with the following: (1) This year's profit-seeking enterprise income tax is calculated based on six times the total income tax payable by each taxpayer in the previous year for estimated payment. The original amount was a temporary measure, and the tax amount will still need to be assessed according to the law, with refunds or additional payments as needed. Various tax revenues in the 37th year's budget have increased significantly. The profit-seeking enterprise income tax has increased approximately twenty times compared to the 36th year. The estimate of six times is still a low estimate. Considering commodity prices, the price index in the 36th year increased approximately fifteen times compared to the 35th year. Estimating payment at six times is actually only a portion of the tax payable. For businesses with no income or income less than six times the previous year, tax refunds will still be available according to the law, with interest added for the refund, so there is no impact on their burden. (2) The adoption of the estimated payment method for profit-seeking enterprise income tax was approved by the State Council as an emergency measure to strengthen tax collection and avoid delays. Subsequently, the income amount should still be investigated and the tax amount assessed according to the law, and the law has not been changed by order. (3) The business of the banking industry comes from the difference between deposit and loan interest and income from remittance and trust services. Although it does not involve the exchange of physical goods like other industries, the difference and income are calculated in currency, and it is undoubtedly affected by rising commodity prices. Therefore, even if the difference in interest rates between deposits and loans does not rise in proportion to commodity prices, the amount of deposits and loans and the surplus are closely related to the rise and fall of commodity prices. The banking industry has always been highly profitable, and its tax-bearing capacity is often above that of other industries. It should work together to overcome difficulties and promptly pay taxes according to the law. The above reply has been telegraphed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and forwarded to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] The Central China Pacification Conference opened at approximately 9:00 AM on the 17th in the National Defense Ministry auditorium. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, providing detailed instructions on the current situation of suppressing bandits. The Chairman stated: "We must raise our awareness and self-encouragement in the military pacification of Central China, to stabilize the Central Plains and ensure the base of Central China." The Chairman also explained the importance of this conference and the necessity of military, political, and economic coordination in the pacification area. The Chairman did not conceal the difficulties of the current situation, but he believed that by exerting the revolutionary spirit, they could be overcome. The Chairman pointed out that to achieve the pacification task, the authority of the commander of the pacification area must be clearly defined. Subordinate units of the central government in the pacification area should be subject to the command and supervision of the commander of the area to meet the needs of suppressing the rebellion, achieve overall war and the unification of party, government, and military, and achieve unified command. The Chairman's instructions lasted one hour, and only important principles were explained.

The meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, still presided over by Bai Chongxi, to discuss the implementation outline of the unification of party, government, and military in the Central China Pacification Area, and conduct preliminary discussions on principles. The opinions of the speakers were synthesized, and it was generally believed that to strengthen the coordination of military, political, and economic affairs during the rebellion suppression period, certain provisions of past laws should be revised. The commander of the pacification area should be subject to the control of the provincial chairman in politics, and the politics and economy of the pacification area should be subject to the command and supervision of the commander of the pacification area, so as to achieve unified command.

<p>Hebei Military and Political Work Discussion Meeting Opens: It is Reported that Fu Zuoyi Described Effective Methods for Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th Dispatch] The Hebei Military and Political Work Discussion Meeting opened at 8:00 AM on the 17th at the Provincial Training Corps in the western suburbs. More than 200 people from various parties attended. Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun personally presided over the meeting. Li Zongren, Wang Bingjun, and Liu Yao also attended and delivered speeches. Li Zongren hoped that the conference would discuss in detail the strengths and weaknesses of itself and the Chinese Communists, and regretted that many people today not only do not know the enemy, but also do not know themselves. Fu Zuoyi emphasized that suppressing bandits is only a matter of method. If psychological and methodological changes can be thoroughly made, victory is assured. He believes that the military must change its psychology from defending against bandits to fighting bandits, and the people must change from fearing bandits to helping the national army suppress bandits. In tactics, it is necessary to break the regularity and use flexibility to avoid being exploited by the bandit army. Finally, he proposed the goal of cultivating new cadres for suppressing bandits: to be able to write when picking up a pen, to be able to speak when opening their mouths, to be able to fight when picking up a gun, to be able to run when pulling their legs, to be able to think when encountering things, to not love mirrors, to be able to endure hardship and suffering, and to not be willing to be in the rear but willing to be on the front line. Subsequently, Chairman Chu Xichun briefly reported on the significance of the meeting, which aims to stabilize the local area and improve people's livelihood. The ceremony was completed at 10:30 AM. The meeting continued in the afternoon, with commissioners and county magistrates from various places reporting separately.</p>

<h3 id="e26">How to Properly Handle Military Service in Shanghai <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai military service work for this year is scheduled to begin on April 1st. The Military Service Association is actively carrying out military service propaganda to assist civil affairs agencies and military service agencies in promoting military administration, calling on aspiring young men to enthusiastically enlist in the military. On the other hand, a lottery committee has been established to handle the lottery matters of eligible men, according to this year's method of complementing lottery and volunteering. Military service is a regular administrative matter for every family. Whether in peacetime or wartime, it is necessary to teach the people to fight and cultivate the power to defend the country and protect their homes. Shanghai's legal handling of military service began last year. Because of the difficulty in establishing a foundation in peacetime and the failure to implement mobilization during the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's military administration is more difficult than anywhere else. Now, young men all over the country are rising up to defend the country and protect their homes. Only Shanghai's mood is low, retreating step by step, without thinking of recovering, which is a disgrace to the citizens of Shanghai. The annual conscription is about to begin this year. It is hoped that Shanghai will have a good start and a good harvest this year, so that the spirit can be transferred and become a model for the whole country.</p>
<p>Military service is an essential element for the survival of an independent country. A country established with sovereignty has independent national defense, and therefore has its military service. In a country that is ruled and enslaved, the constitution does not stipulate that the people have the obligation to serve as soldiers, and state affairs do not allow for military administrative affairs, so there is no such thing as independent "national defense." On the contrary, a country with independent sovereignty depends on national defense to protect its territory and sovereignty and its people, and it depends on the army to defend it. Therefore, the constitution stipulates that the people have the obligation to serve as soldiers. The Soviet military service law stipulates that serving as a soldier is not only an obligation for the people, but also a right, and conscription is an honor. The Constitution of our country stipulates that all people have the obligation to perform military service. As for how to perform military service? It is specifically stipulated by the Military Service Law. During the eight years of our country's Anti-Japanese War, the soldiers on the front line were able to advance wave after wave, and the replenishment was not lacking, thanks to the implementation of the Military Service Law. After the victory and demobilization, the national military service was postponed for one year, and the Military Service Law was also partially revised at this time. The National Government promulgated and implemented it on October 10, 35th year, and issued a notice to the people of the country saying: "From October 10, 35th year, follow the revised military service laws and regulations and continue to implement them. All our citizens must know that military service is the natural duty of everyone, and must encourage each other to enthusiastically enlist, so that the foundation of military construction can be laid and the strength of national defense can be enriched." To assist in the implementation of the Military Service Law, the National Government promulgated and implemented the Military Service Law Implementation Law on February 19, 36th year, stipulating that the Ministry of National Defense is the competent authority for national military service. In recent years, the Ministry of National Defense has formulated many implementation guidelines for conscription in order to make military service cooperate with the suppression of the rebellion and military affairs, calling on aspiring young men to bravely join the army, so as to enrich the source of soldiers. In the past year, although the performance of military service in various places has not yet reached an ideal state, everyone knows that serving as a soldier is a duty.</p>
<p>Shanghai's handling of military service began last year. Because there was never a military service foundation established in the past, and most people did not have enough understanding of the Military Service Law, the trial conscription of volunteers was carried out first. After there were results and scale, according to the provisions of the Military Service Law, 2,943 people were conscripted by lottery, completing this experiment. This year, Shanghai's quota of soldiers is 6,000, which is double that of last year. In terms of Shanghai's population ratio, this number of soldiers is a good policy, and everyone should like it; if it is not handled well, everyone will hate it, and military service will become an oppressive government, which is extremely inappropriate.</p>
<p>How to handle military service properly? The first is to act according to the law, without favoritism or negligence; the second is to strive for three fairnesses: equality, fairness, and reasonableness. The above is the spirit of handling military affairs; as for the handling steps and the matters that should be paid attention to at present, there are the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the lottery, according to the decision of the Shanghai Military Service Conference on the 29th of last month, this year's military service will be carried out by combining lottery conscription and volunteer soldiers. That is to say, first carry out lottery conscription according to the Military Service Law, and then supplement it with volunteer soldiers. The lottery is a procedure of conscription. It is used to determine whether eligible men serve in the military and the order of entry. This is a very fair method. According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, the lottery must be carried out after background investigation, exemption investigation, and physical examination, so that there will be no confusion. It is heard that the conscription date of this city is scheduled for the 25th of this month, and now there is a saying that it will be changed to the 23rd. If the above conscription processing is not completed, and the conscription lottery is carried out in a hurry, there will inevitably be many technical problems to be remedied, which should be paid special attention to.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding conscription, conscription under the Military Service Law is handled by year of birth. This assumes that the household registration is correct and the population census is completed; if the household registration is not clear and the birth registration is not clear, it is extremely difficult to meet the actual situation to conscript by year of birth. It is heard that the implementation method of this year's conscription stipulates that in the first phase of conscription, one year of birth who are fully 20 years old (those born in the 16th year of the Republic of China) will be conscripted in order, and if the quota is insufficient, the year of birth will gradually be extended until the quota is met. Now the so-called lottery is to draw whether there are enough men who are fully 20 years old to meet the quota, which is not without doubt. Whether the men of Taian's age are evading, and whether the conscription is smooth, is even more doubtful. Shanghai has been promoting military administration for two years, and legal lottery is still a new initiative. In order to make the implementation effective and not empty words, the scope of the conscription year can be relaxed, which can reduce the situation of selecting labor and achieve the effect of conscription.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding preferential treatment, the so-called preferential treatment refers to the settlement expenses for men who join the army and the subsequent support for the family members. In the past, the funds for settlement expenses for new recruits were mostly taken from households without men going to war, or donated by wealthy families, which were not normal ways. It is heard that Shanghai is requesting the municipal government to allocate 5% of the income from public utilities and the banquet donation and entertainment items to raise funds for the settlement expenses of new recruits, which is undoubtedly a reasonable way to solve the source of funds for preferential treatment. However, settlement expenses are a one-time relief preferential treatment, and the government should be responsible for various rights and interests that the families of soldiers going to war should have in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding volunteer soldiers, according to the research of military scientists and the experience of the United Kingdom and the United States in handling volunteer soldiers, volunteer soldiers are often troops with higher quality. Now our country's youth army is serving as volunteer soldiers. The current military service law of our country contains the spirit of volunteer soldiers, and volunteer soldiers should be promoted. Shanghai has a large number of educated youths. If they can be called to love the country and love their hometown, I believe that outstanding young men with professional duties will rise up and join the army. "A righteous man does not forget to be in a ditch, and a brave man does not forget to lose his head." The decisiveness of Nie Zheng in killing thieves is waiting to be recruited. We believe in the importance of educated youths volunteering to join the army. We hope that the military service authorities will seize the opportunity, call out loudly, and righteous people will follow one after another, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>In short, military service is an important policy of the country, and everyone has the obligation to perform military service according to the law. It cannot be avoided or borrowed. Today's country has entered an extraordinary period, and everyone must serve the country. Aspiring young men should especially make up their minds, rise up together, and participate in the movement to defend the country and protect their hometown, in order to fight for the survival of the country and the peace of the local area. Shanghai has superior conditions for promoting military administration. It is hoped that institutions at all levels will be determined to handle military service well, and the government should be integrated with the people. Soldiers come from the people, and the people are soldiers. Let us work together to defend the country and protect our hometown!</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Shandong petition group, represented by Pei Mingyu and Lü Ziren, and the Qingdao petition group, represented by Li Shifang and Jiang Lichuan, arrived in Nanjing and have been visiting relevant authorities for several days to present their petitions. They plan to meet with Chairman Chiang and President Zhang soon to explain the difficult situation in Shandong and Qingdao. On the 17th, they held a press conference and presented their six minimum demands. Liu Zhiping, Du Guangxun, and other people from Shandong residing in Nanjing also attended, calling for attention to the situation in Shandong and explaining the current difficulties. Their six demands are as follows: (1) Military: National troops stationed in Shandong should not be transferred elsewhere, and additional strong forces should be dispatched to Shandong. (2) Food: Shandong and Qingdao urgently need food. The government should lift the restriction on transporting grain from the south to the north, implement rationing in Jinan, Qingdao, and southern cities, and allocate grain loans of 9.252 billion yuan to Shandong and 9.392 billion yuan to Qingdao. (3) Fuel: Shandong and Qingdao areas lack fuel.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Changshou Power Plant under the National Resources Commission uses the Longxi River's hydropower to generate electricity, resulting in very low electricity prices, which has greatly promoted the development of Changshou's industry. However, the electricity supply was still insufficient, so last winter, two 750 kW hydropower generators previously purchased from the United States were shipped from Shanghai to Changshou and installed at the Xia Qingyuan Power Station. It has recently been learned that both generators were installed and completed on the 11th of this month, and the test run results were excellent. They can now officially supply electricity, which will alleviate the power shortage problem in Changshou's factories. It is also reported that the plant is building a new power station with a capacity of 10,000 kW at Xia Qingyuan, and the civil engineering work is mostly completed and is currently continuing.</p>

<p>$5.5 Million USD Already Paid</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] The International Children's Emergency Fund has recently allocated $5.5 million USD to help impoverished children in China. The plan drafted by the Fund's delegation to China has been approved by the Fund's Planning Committee and will be used to purchase relief supplies for shipment to China. A Fund spokesperson said that the delegation to China, led by Junod, is expected to submit a report within the month. The $5.5 million USD will be used for ten months of refugee relief in China. The Executive Board of the International Children's Emergency Fund had previously allocated $3.5 million USD last year, and another $2 million USD was allocated last week. However, due to the United Nations' appeal for refugees, even more donations are pouring in, so China will receive even more funds in the future. The Fund has sent hundreds of shipments of relief supplies to Europe, but it has not yet provided any relief in China. Although the Chinese side has repeatedly protested to no avail, Fund officials stated that there are many reasons for the delay, the main one being that there is no finalized plan for China. The Executive Board, which has the final authority to approve work plans, has authorized the Planning Committee to draft a plan for China to save time.</p>

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notifies the Nation</p>
<p>[This City Dispatch] During the War of Resistance, many valuable cultural relics of China and allied countries were destroyed or looted by the Japanese, and their whereabouts are unknown.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the passage of the cultural relic compensation case is not far off. It has notified relevant agencies and informed the people of the country to promptly submit applications for wartime losses of cultural relics (including movable property of an artistic, historical, religious, or educational nature, and libraries that cannot be replaced by ordinary production and trade methods) in accordance with the regulations of the Allied Headquarters, in order to organize and study them.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tainan, 17th] Tainan County, which relies on irrigation to be Taiwan's granary, is proceeding with the construction of the Touliu Canal project in addition to the existing Jianan Canal. At the same time, a land improvement project is being undertaken to increase agricultural production. The planned main line of the Touliu Canal is 32 kilometers long, and the branch lines, large and small drainage canals, etc., will total 2,414 kilometers. If they were connected into one long waterway, it would be five times the length of the longitudinal railway from Keelung to Linbian plus 1417 kilometers, and it could also circle the entire island of Taiwan nearly three times. This project started on November 12th last year, and 2,800 workers are currently working on it every day. It is expected to take five years to complete, and the project cost is NT$1.445 billion, which is truly a major construction project after the war. Half of all costs are subsidized by the government, and the other half is shared by the beneficiary fields based on their benefit situation. The funds required during the construction period are advanced by the government, and the people's share is borrowed from local banks in the province. When the land yields increase, the people will repay in installments. After the entire project is completed in the future, the cultivated area can be increased by more than 24,000 mu, and the annual increase in production value is estimated to be over NT$3.65 billion. The increased value of the land itself is not included in this calculation. Tainan has a total area of 4,884 square kilometers, accounting for one-seventh of the province's area, and the annual output of the county's three major agricultural products – rice, sugarcane, and lotus root – often accounts for one-quarter to one-third of the entire province. In the future, after the completion of this nationally innovative Touliu land improvement project and the largest-scale Touliu Canal irrigation project in Taiwan since its retrocession, the development of Tainan County's agricultural economy is immeasurable.</p>

<h3 id="e59">One Week War Situation Analysis Published by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released an analysis of the war situation from the 10th to the 16th on the 17th. The full text is as follows: Since the launch of the army expansion movement and the expanded military training movement last winter, followed by the "Three Examinations" movement of examining thought, class, and bloodline to consolidate the interior, the Communists have been preparing to launch a full-scale insurgency. In the past week, Communist troops have been active in various battlefields. The National Army, in response to the Communist actions, is concentrating its forces in the Northeast to respond to the overall strategy, and on the evening of the 9th, proactively withdrew from Yongji. Out of consideration for the lives and property of the people, no damage was done to the Xiaoti Man Power Plant, or even the ammunition depot in the urban area. The people of Yongji, knowing the cruelty and viciousness of the Communists, voluntarily endured the cold and long trek, bringing the old and young with them, preferring to leave their homes and follow the National Army in sharing hardships. This spirit of not wanting to be slaves and striving for freedom is truly earth-shattering. When the National Army was covering the retreat of the people and government agencies, it encountered the Communist Independent 9th Division, which attempted to obstruct them. Under the great joint attack of the military and the people, the Communists were defeated, and 914 prisoners were captured. By 10:00 AM on the 12th, all had safely arrived in Changchun, creating a miracle of retreat on the land of the Far East like Dunkirk.</p>
<p>As for the Communist forces in the Siping area, they used seven times the strength of the National Army. Since the 4th, it has been two weeks, and the Communist forces have suffered more than 20,000 casualties under the so-called "human wave" and "human bomb" tactics. The National Army achieved such a great price, and only withdrew from the urban area on the afternoon of the 15th, and is still scattered in the nearby suburban areas fighting the Communists. In North China, the National Army has been reporting frequent victories in the sweeping campaign in eastern Hebei for a week, achieving many results. The Communist forces in western Hebei, in order to support the disastrous defeat in eastern Hebei, have collected the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 5th Columns and repeatedly claimed that they would attack Baoding again, but after a tentative disturbance between Xushui and Baoding, they were defeated and retreated by the National Army. These days, they have disappeared again.</p>
<p>In Central China, Chen Yi, in order to reverse the disastrous defeat of his 11th and 12th Columns in Dongtai, northern Jiangsu, hurriedly transferred the 2nd Column from central Shandong and hurriedly fled south across the southern road, attempting to reinforce northern Jiangsu, but was attacked by the National Army along the way, and was unable to struggle in the area south of Xiaopu and north of Lianshui. At the same time, in order to contain northern Jiangsu, Chen Yi sent the 9th and 13th Columns, plus a new 8th Column and four guard regiments, a total of more than 40,000 troops, to launch a containment attack in Zhoucun, Huantai, Zichuan, and other places on the Jiaoji Railway, but so far, in addition to paying the price of more than 10,000 casualties, they still cannot shake Huantai and Zichuan. The main force of Chen Yi, the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns, have not been fully replenished, and were beaten by the National Army from western Shandong to eastern Henan, and then chased from eastern Henan to western Shandong. In the vicinity of Dancheng, they were fiercely attacked by the National Army. As of yesterday, there was almost no place for them to stand in western Shandong, and except for the two Guangdong columns, most of them had to sneak across the Yellow River and flee north.</p>
<p>In the Luoyang area, Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns and the 38th Army, as well as part of the 38th and 2 Columns of Chen Yi's forces that had fled from eastern Henan, a total of about 70,000 people, began to attack Luoyang from the 8th of the previous week. Our defending army, with less than a division of troops, resisted six times the number of Communist troops. On the 11th, the Communists also transferred the 8th Column from Shanxi to cross the river at Kuangkou and join the attack. Our heroic National Army fought bravely, one after another, killing more than 10,000 Communist troops. The Communists suffered heavy casualties, and part of them entered the urban area three days ago, but the National Army was still able to hold the core and the northwest corner of the position and continue to attack the Communists. Currently, the National Army reinforcements have arrived in the suburbs and are deploying to severely attack the Communists.</p>
<p>In the Northwest, the Communists began attacking Yichuan on the 8th, attempting to control Luochuan, but were attacked by the National Army and had to stop. On the 14th, Communist leader Peng Dehuai personally led the Independent Workers Brigade and the 2nd Column, more than 10,000 people, intending to bypass Pucheng. The National Army gave the Communists another heavy blow in the area north of Pucheng, forcing the Communists to turn north and retreat. Currently, most of the large Communist forces are heading west, and some have the appearance of going up Huanglong Mountain to become bandits. The National Army is advancing north from Tongchuan and Pucheng in separate directions.</p>
<p>The 3rd and 6th Columns of Liu's Communist forces in the Dabie Mountain area are still being annihilated by the National Army separately in the areas west of Yuexi, east of Jingfu, and north of Luotian and Macheng. More than 1,000 Communist troops have been killed or wounded in the past week. The 1st and 2nd Columns are still south of Shenqiu, northeast of Xincai, and near Linquan, attempting to flee north, joining forces with the 10th and 11th Columns, and continuing to harass the Yellow River Pan District. The National Army is attacking from the north and south. The recent suppression in this area has proven the strength of the people united with the National Army.</p>

Its tangible wealth can be demonstrated with one example, namely, the Northeast's three-year soybean trade, which can recover the total amount of legal tender circulating in the country. The Northeast produces 5 million tons of soybeans annually, with each ton worth US$180. The amount accumulated over three years is staggering. Therefore, if China wants to stand tall as a nation, it cannot do without the Northeast. Today, the situation in the Northeast is deteriorating day by day. If the Communist bandits occupy the entire Northeast, the Communist government will be established immediately, and a large army can invade North China and even the entire China. At that time, what will the situation be? The Northeast is in danger, and we hope that the people of the country will provide assistance in a timely manner!"</p>
<p>Reporting the Results of the Petition</p>
<p>Wang continued to report on the results of the petition to Chairman Chiang, stating: "Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the people of the Northeast. After the petition delegation met with him, the Chairman agreed to fully support them in terms of military affairs, food, and economy: (1) Military affairs: The central government will never change its overall plan for the Northeast, and the Northeast must be defended to the death. Those past strategies that should be revised will be revised immediately. In future strategies, in addition to focusing on military affairs, equal importance will be attached to the use of civilian power. (2) Food: The Food Department has decided to fully supply the people of the Northeast with food seeds. The food for March and April has been prepared. The only concern is the transportation issue, which is currently being actively addressed. The air route from Beiping to Shenyang has been shortened so that it can operate three times a day. (3) Economy: The government's original intention in issuing Northeast circulating coupons was good, but because the situation in the Northeast today is very different from the past, the total number of residents in the Northeast used to be 47 million, but now it is only 7 million, resulting in inflation and the people being oppressed and unable to breathe. Former Northeast elder Zhang Zuoxiang also suggested that the central government find ways to coordinate the Northeast monetary system with the rest of the country and control the currency value with the exchange rate. After consulting with the Food Department, there are concrete solutions."</p>
<p>Request to Fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty</p>
<p>Wang continued, "We also visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Ambassador Stuart, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Ambassador Stuart attached great importance to the trend of public opinion in the Northeast when he met with the petition delegation, and inquired in detail whether the people still maintained their consistent confidence in the central government. Wang concluded by appealing to all sectors with a full heart of sorrow, stating that the situation in the Northeast cannot be allowed to deteriorate further and that rescuing the Northeast is now extremely urgent."</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mayor of Shenyang Zhang Shici delivered a speech stating: "The solution to the Northeast problem depends on military success. The Northeast is the military center for suppressing bandits, Shanghai is the economic center for suppressing bandits, and Nanjing is the diplomatic center for suppressing bandits. How to coordinate the three to ensure the early success of bandit suppression?"</p>
<p>提出三點呼籲</p>
<p>Tian Yushi then made three appeals: (1) The Northeast issue is an integral whole, and it is hoped that the country will unify its will to save the Northeast. (2) Concentrate manpower and material resources to strengthen the central government's strength in suppressing bandits, and hope that Shanghai will set an example in suppressing bandits. (3) After the fall of Yongji, more than 300,000 righteous people retreated to Changchun with the national army, and they must be rescued immediately.</p>
<p>After the representatives from the Northeast finished speaking, Mayor Wu stood up and gave a concluding speech: (1) Saving the Northeast is saving ourselves. (2) For bandit suppression to succeed, the people of the whole country must wake up in time and unify their will. (3) To aid the refugees from the Northeast, the city's winter relief fund will allocate a portion to purchase food and supplies to aid the refugees from the Northeast. The transportation method will be discussed later. After hearing this, the Northeast Petition Delegation applauded to express their gratitude. Finally, Miss Song Guorui, on behalf of the Northeast Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, presented flowers to Wang Huayi, a representative of the petition delegation. The tea party ended at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Industrial Association has formally submitted a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs requesting a uniform regulation that the wages of workers in all factories be settled according to the cost of living index for the previous month. At the same time, the Stack-Manufactured National Goods Factory Federation also submitted a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that they cannot bear the burden due to the high cost of living index and requesting the formulation of fundamental solutions. The Bureau of Social Affairs has forwarded the two documents to the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee, which has decided to establish a group with the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the Labor Association to convene a meeting at a later date for detailed study.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Industrial Association issued a statement yesterday stating: "Recently, newspapers have often published reports stating that the Industrial Association has requested the freezing of workers' cost of living index, etc. This is not in accordance with the facts. The board of directors and supervisors of the Industrial Association only made a resolution to the effect that 'in order to enable factories to predict costs and avoid closing due to losses, the government should rigidly stipulate that the wages for this month be issued according to the cost of living index for the previous month.' They never requested the freezing of the index."</p>

<h3 id="e89">American-owned Electricity Company - Hosts Reporters for Visit <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The American-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company at Yangshupu provides 80% of the city's total electricity. The Shanghai Electric Power Company first generated electricity in 1913, and has a history of 35 years to date. In the former concession era, it was originally the Electrical Department of the Municipal Council. In 1929, it was sold to Americans at the same time as the telephone company and became an American-operated enterprise. However, all organizations comply with Chinese company law and are subject to the Public Utilities Bureau of the Municipal Government. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the company specially invited the press to visit. The company's President and Vice President, TC Pleace (American) and Kaec (Czech), received the reporters in the reception room. First, they used simple and clear slides to explain the steps of power generation, which included the following parts: (1) 18 different generators in the factory, (2) Coal is transported by barge (3) Coal crane—lifting coal from the ground to a high place and then into the furnace, (4) Coal mill—large pieces of coal need to be ground into coal dust before they can be used for combustion, (5) Pump—the water of the Huangpu River is pumped into use, (6) Oil pump—diesel oil is also one of the main fuels, and diesel oil also needs a pump to transport it, (7) Coal dust furnace—some furnaces use coal dust as fuel, (8) Coal dust is transported by spiral conveyor. After viewing the slides, the reporters were then guided to various departments for a practical visit. Thanks to the guidance of the slides, the reporters were very clear about the initiation of electricity. The original power for electricity generation is water and fuel. The pumping station of the electric power company is built at the bottom of the Huangpu River so that the water of the Huangpu River can be fully utilized and circulated continuously. The main fuels are coal dust and diesel oil, which turn water into steam to drive the generator to generate electricity. The variety of mechanical equipment in the electric power company and the effectiveness of its coordination are quite amazing to laymen. Although the company consumes a large amount of coal and diesel oil every day, the company currently has a sufficient supply of coal, which can last for about one month. Even if the coal supply is cut off, it can still generate electricity with diesel oil, so the people of Shanghai do not need to worry about the supply of electricity.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Newly Announced Conscription Quotas for Each District - One Out of Every Thirty-Eight Eligible Young Men is Drafted - Last Year's Shortfall Will Be Made Up by Each District Separately <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The city's first conscription of 6,000 soldiers this year has been allocated by the Bureau of Civil Affairs based on the total number of active-duty and eligible men aged 21 to 25 in each district surveyed last year. The full quota is recorded as follows: 267 from Huangpu District, 77 from Laoza District, 244 from Yimiao District, 373 from Penglai District, 488 from Songshan District, 206 from Lujiawan District, 214 from Changshu District, 121 from Xuhui District, 223 from Changning District, 256 from Jianan District, 404 from Xincheng District, 371 from Jiangning District, 226 from Putuo District, 201 from Zhabei District, 288 from Beizhan District, 231 from Hongkou District, 131 from North Sichuan Road District, 304 from Tilanqiao District, 216 from Yulin District, 133 from Yangpu District, 45 from Xinshi District, 36 from Jiangwan District, 36 from Wusong District, 59 from Dachang District, 144 from Xinjing District, 97 from Longhua District, 81 from Yangsi District, 230 from Yangjing District, 78 from Gaoqiao District, and 476 from Zhenru District, for a total of 6,026 people. The quota number and method, it is learned: the bureau allocated the quota in accordance with the central government's regulations, dividing the total number of active-duty and eligible men in the city by the number obtained, and then multiplying the number of active-duty and eligible men in each district by the quotient, which is the number allocated to each of the above districts. On average, one out of every thirty-eight eligible young men is drafted. A person in charge of the bureau said yesterday that the twenty-six extra people drafted for the first time this year can offset the quota for next year (or the next time). As for the fifty-seven people who have not yet been drafted last year, they will be separately investigated and supplemented by the districts with shortages during this conscription and will not be added to the quota for this time.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Households Without Conscripted Men - Collect Preferential Fees in Four Grades - Receipts Not in Compliance Can Be Reported to the Military Association <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Military Service Association has set a standard for preferential fees for households without conscripted men, divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A is 300,000 yuan per household, Grade B is 100,000 yuan per household, Grade C is 50,000 yuan per household, and Grade D is 30,000 yuan per household. The association prints receipts and distributes them to the district Bao for collection. In order to distinguish the receipts, Grade A is printed on red paper, Grade B is printed on green paper, Grade C is printed on yellow paper, and Grade D is printed on white paper, with the words "Grade A, Grade B, Grade C, Grade D" printed on the top of the receipts. The association is now dispatching personnel with the Bureau of Civil Affairs to supervise the collection. If the amount paid by a household without a conscripted man last year does not match the color of the receipt or if there is no receipt for the collection, it can be reported directly to the Military Service Association to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Middle Class Should Quickly Unite - Urge the Government to Complete the Suppression of Rebellion - Hope that Chinese and Foreign People Will Pay Attention to the Overall Situation and Strive to Save the Situation - Speaker Pan Publishes Important Speech <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>In the past half month, prices have soared, the cost of living index will inevitably rise, and industry and commerce are feeling difficult. The fact that American aid has not yet been seen is causing increasing unease among the people. The reporter specially visited Speaker Pan Gongzhan to inquire about his opinions. Pan replied: "The Municipal Council had a serious discussion on this issue during the meeting and made suggestions that the foreign exchange rate should not be raised at any time, that a linked import and export system should be adopted, that exports should be encouraged, that overseas remittances should be subsidized, that the prices of public utilities should be stabilized, etc. I believe that if drastic measures are taken and there is a determination to do it, it will be possible to save the situation, or at least stop the rising trend. Unfortunately, the authorities have not yet paid attention to public opinion and are still following the old ways, resulting in (1) foreign exchange, (2) prices, and (3) wages rising in a cycle without any improvement. From March of last year to February of this year, prices have risen at least twenty times in one year, which is far more than the five times or so in the previous year. We really don't know what the responsible authorities have been doing in this year to cause this."</p>
<p>Human Factors Need to Be Reviewed - In the current overall situation, we must, on the one hand, appeal to the United States that military and economic aid to China should go hand in hand and that time is of the essence. On the other hand, we should strive to reform all facilities in politics, economy, and military affairs. Otherwise, like a patient who refuses to see a doctor, what good will foreign aid do even if it is obtained? Doesn't the recent rise in grain prices despite the arrival of American grain and the rise in cotton prices despite the arrival of American cotton show this? The human factors in this need to be reviewed by ourselves. The Municipal Council sent a memorandum to the United States on March 6, appealing for aid to China. The memorandum suggested that the military budget for our country's suppression of communists, including ammunition, grain, and clothing, should be separated from the ordinary budget and that the aid should be used to support the military budget. In this way, the ordinary budget will definitely be balanced with a surplus, and there will be no need to issue more currency. With a stable currency value, people will be at ease, and everything can gradually get on track. At this time, we should also exert public opinion and supervise the central and local governments to promote political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>Thorough Reform Coupled with American Aid - As for the military supply system, it should be strictly independent to ensure that there are no abuses and that military expenses do not flow into the market and become speculative capital. In short, we must have thorough reforms that are coupled with the actions of American aid. After the adjournment of the fifth meeting of the Municipal Council, I invited people from the education, culture, industry, commerce, and finance sectors of this city to conduct detailed discussions based on this direction. The discussions are still ongoing, and suggestions will be made soon. Because the current situation is so serious, intellectuals, those who live on salaries, and the middle class, who have always been the security force of society, must quickly unite and contribute their opinions and abilities to urge the government to complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion. Otherwise, after being destroyed by the communists, China will inevitably become a vassal of a totalitarian communist country, and the maintenance of world peace will also be in danger. I hope that Chinese and foreign people will pay attention to the overall situation and strive to save the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Insatiable Greed for Stolen Goods: Uncle Participates in Robbery; A Group of Robbers from Sheng County Arrested After Thorough Investigation; Confessed to Participating in the Robbery of a Foreign Woman's Home <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] At approximately 10:00 AM on the 8th of this month, the Hongkou Police Station received a phone call from Gongji Hospital reporting that Chen Shouqi, at No. 4, Lane 159, Jiulong Road, was injured after jumping from a back building's window during a robbery and was seeking treatment at the hospital. The Deputy and Assistant Directors of the station, Li Zhizhang and Yin Zhenming, along with Criminal Division Chief Xu Shibin, officers Wang Songyue, Gan Zhang Yongchang, and Zhang Yonglai, rushed to the scene to apprehend the bandits, but they had already fled. After investigation, it was learned that the residence at No. 4, Lane 159, Jiulong Road, belonged to Zhou Dejun. At around 10:30 AM that morning, four robbers entered through the back door, brandishing firearms, warning against making any noise, and forcing all residents into a back room, tying them up with ropes. One robber guarded them with a gun while the others ransacked the house for half an hour before fleeing. Chen Shouqi, one of the residents, struggled free from his restraints and jumped from an upstairs window, resulting in a foot injury. He then took a taxi to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the victim, Zhou Dejun, discovered that five gold bars, two diamond rings, 550 US dollars, four gold rings, and watches and legal tender, all hidden in the cupboard, had been stolen. Chief Xu and Officer Wang interrogated Zhou Dejun and learned that Zhou had an uncle, Zhou Lansheng, who had worked as a tailor in Zhou's home last winter. He left after completing his work at the end of the year. On the 4th of this month, Lansheng returned to Zhou's house to borrow one million legal tender, but only borrowed 500,000, expressing dissatisfaction and leaving disgruntled. Furthermore, it was learned that the robbers all spoke with a Sheng County accent, which was the same as the victim's hometown, leading them to believe that Lansheng was involved in the case. Chief Xu planned to conduct a discreet investigation among the people of Sheng County and dispatched officers Wang Songyue, Ye Zhengxing, and Zhang Yongchang to investigate various Yue Opera venues. Sure enough, at around 10:00 AM on the 9th, a man named Li Liangchen from Sheng County was apprehended backstage at the Baxianqiao Empire Yue Opera Theater and taken to the station for questioning, where he confessed to participating in the robbery. The case officers then took him to the home of Qiu Chunfu at No. 3, Lane 25, Wangting Street, where they found two large gold bars, 40 US dollars, a handgun, and other stolen goods such as gold rings and cash. Further thorough investigation revealed that an accomplice, Yin Xitang, was planning to flee to Sheng County. At around 11:00 PM on the 11th, officers followed him by car to Xiaoshan County, where they spotted Yin waiting for a bus at the Xiaoshan bus station and immediately arrested him. They found 140 US dollars, two gold bracelets, and twelve gold rings in his suitcase and brought him back to Shanghai, where he also confessed to participating in the robbery. According to their confessions, an accomplice, Shen Jifa, had relatives living at No. 52 Qing'an New Village, Jumen Road. Officers were dispatched to arrest Shen's aunt, Gu Yazhen, and seized a Mauser pistol used in the robbery and a gold ring at her home. She confessed that her brother-in-law, Shen Jifa, had likely fled to his father-in-law's home in Shigaotang Village, Zhenhai. Consequently, disguised officers, along with Gu, traveled to Zhenhai by the Jiangjing Ferry at 5:00 PM on the 13th, arriving at 6:00 AM the next morning. They knocked on the door and successfully arrested Shen, also recovering a large gold bar and a diamond ring. He was brought back to Shanghai that day. Chief Zhai Junhou and Section Chief Feng Qishan of the Criminal Investigation Section Two of the General Police Department also arrested Zhou Lansheng, Sun Zhilong, and several other accomplices, recovering two large gold bars and US dollars. According to the confessions of Shen Jifa and Yin Xitang, they also participated in the robbery of clothing from the home of dancer Li Zhen, a foreign woman, on November 8th of last winter, and the robbery of Zhou Yixing's property on January 5th, participating in a total of four or five robberies. The investigation is now complete and will be transferred to the court for prosecution in the coming days.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The case of the worker riot at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory has been investigated by the Shanghai Police Department. Yesterday, the case file was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial. Because the Special Court does not yet have a detention center, the suspects are still detained in the police station. In addition, two workers from Zhenfeng Yarn Factory are detained in the Shanghai Prison. One is Wang Kun, 25 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 25, East Linsen Road, and the other is Wang Yihua, 20 years old, from Yuyao, residing at the Wuxi Telecom Bureau. However, the organizational regulations and trial procedures of the Special Criminal Court still need to be officially promulgated and implemented before they can be followed. The judiciary of the city is paying close attention to how the court will handle the case.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Trial Opens in Lawmaker Election Case: Wang Jian'e and Cao Jun Deny Illegal Activities <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Elected Shanghai legislator Wang Jian'e and first runner-up Cao Jun were recently sued by Huang Minhou, Zhang Qingshan, Dai Yun (female), and others, accusing them of election fraud and requesting confirmation that the election was invalid. Yesterday, President Zhang Qinglan of the High Court opened a second civil court for a public hearing. The plaintiffs' grounds for the complaint were: Wang Jian'e is a member of the Kuomintang, but he was not nominated by the Shanghai Party Headquarters, and he is currently the district chief of Xincheng District, which makes him ineligible to run for election according to law. Cao Jun had more votes than voters in the Zhenru area, and it should be ruled invalid. Yesterday, the defendants hired lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Huang Jiyuan to defend them in court. They presented documents proving that "Although the number of votes in Zhenru election was more than the number of issued votes, the total number of votes in the city was still consistent. It was obviously caused by the misplacement of votes from other polling stations, and should not be considered invalid votes." Regarding Wang, they argued that the elected district chief is eligible to run for election according to the regulations of the Ministry of Interior. The plaintiffs requested that the High Court send a letter to the Control Yuan to review the report of the Control Committee members He Hanwen and Fan Zhengbo, who investigated election fraud in the city, as a reference for the trial of the case. The court announced that the case would be continued on the 25th.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Labor Dispute at British Tram Company: Mediation by Social Affairs Bureau Resolved Yesterday; Only the Year-End Salary Increase Still Needs Further Discussion <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The British Tram Workers' Union held a member representative meeting on the 12th of this month to discuss how to negotiate with the company to resolve the outstanding issues related to employee benefits over the past two years. It was decided to put forward four specific demands: (1) Employees who were forced to leave during the enemy and puppet period should have their treatment, seniority, and pension restored after repatriation. (2) Employees should be granted special leave: 7 days for one year of service, 10 days for five years, and 14 days for ten years or more, with wages paid as usual and calculated according to the January cost of living index. (3) Semi-skilled workers in the mechanical department who pass the assessment and become technicians should also have their wages adjusted. (4) The year-end salary increase for staff last year was two yuan less than the base salary of the previous year, and should be compensated. They also set a deadline of 6:00 PM yesterday for a response, stating that they would take action immediately if the deadline was exceeded. The company felt that it was difficult to meet these demands, so it appealed to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. Yesterday morning, Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, summoned four representatives of the union, Chou Changjiang, Que Yangtian, Xu Shijian, and Chen Chunshi, to the bureau for mediation and offered sincere guidance. The four representatives stated that the four demands were the decision of the representative meeting and they had no right to change them, and their attitude was very firm. Later, Deputy Director Zhao obtained the consent of the employer to accept the first three demands, but the employer stated that there were still difficulties with the year-end salary increase for staff and that it would be discussed further. Deputy Director Zhao also promised to continue to mediate on this issue. After the four representatives returned to the union, they convened an emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 4:00 PM in the afternoon to report on the progress. All members of the committee were satisfied with the progress of the negotiations, so they passed a resolution to temporarily retain the previous decision that "action will be taken if any one of the four demands is not satisfactorily answered." As for the issue of the year-end salary increase for staff, they will continue to strive for it.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Hangzhou! Where to Go? <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Hangzhou Fifteenth Dispatch] "Three winter months rely on one spring," once spring arrives in Hangzhou, the people living by the West Lake happily welcome the season for making money. Even the municipal government's major income relies on things like spring banquet donations to make up for the city treasury for the year. On the surface, this bright spring seems to be beneficial to Hangzhou, but in reality, upon careful consideration, it cannot avoid being a kind of humiliation. It seems that Hangzhou has no other way but to rely on spring tourists for its prosperity.</p>
<p>When we study history, Hangzhou's rise as a capital city was not necessarily due to the scenic West Lake.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation during the Tang and Song Dynasties: "Houses and mansions are magnificent, numbering over one hundred thousand," Marco Polo even said there were 1.6 million households. The population was especially flourishing, and the city's waterways were clear and unobstructed, with large ships able to pass through without hindrance. From the North Gate, one could go deep into the city center, and there were thousands of warehouses along the river specifically for storing goods. Products from all directions gathered here, and business on the main streets continued day and night. Only in the third or fourth watch of the night did the number of tourists begin to dwindle, and at the rooster's crow in the fifth watch of the morning, the market sellers were already opening their stalls. It can be said that Hangzhou's rise as a major city was due to the gathering of merchants. At the same time, Hangzhou's handicraft industry was also exceptionally developed. During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, it was the center of the nation's handicraft industry, and the "Record of Youmei Hall" contains phrases such as "their customs are skilled and ingenious." Therefore, Hangzhou at that time was the leading province in the southeast, as well as the leading province in the entire country. In the twelfth century, the Southern Song Dynasty was the most prosperous in the world, making it the world's largest metropolis. Marco Polo, after the fall of the Southern Song Dynasty, still steadfastly regarded it as "the most beautiful and magnificent city in the world" - "the Great City." In the Tang, Song, and Yuan eras, it can be said that Hangzhou did not rely on nurturing from foreign tourists. Instead, it possessed its own manufacturing handicraft industry and flourishing commercial conditions.</p>
<p>From the Ming and Qing Dynasties onwards, the handicraft industry was defeated by the mechanical industry, and the metropolis of Shanghai, closer to foreign lands, was established. Hangzhou's position was no longer as important as before. By the Republican era, Shanghai's developed industry and commerce caused Hangzhou to become</p>
<p>a dependency of Shanghai, relying on Shanghai for everything. Clever people in Hangzhou used the scenery to attract tourists to pass these peaceful years.</p>
<p>Judging from the current trend of Hangzhou, it certainly will not have an industrial future. Similarly, its commercial future will not surpass Shanghai for some time. And some of the so-called Hangzhou local products are not actually produced by Hangzhou itself. For example, walnuts are produced in Changhua, Chinese torreya nuts are produced in Xiaoshan, bamboo baskets are produced in Yuhang and Lin'an, and bamboo shoots are produced in Lin'an and Yuhang. So Hangzhou itself has very few specialty products. Even the so-called tea leaves are supplied by Hangxian, Yuhang, Shaoxing, and other counties. As for factories, if compared with Shanghai, they are far behind. Some people believe that the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the upcoming navigation of the Qiantang River can help</p>
<p>Hangzhou's development. However, if Hangzhou itself does not have industrial construction, then Hangzhou's prosperity will only be a commercial transit point, and its economic value will not be significant. If we want industrial construction, then things like coal, electricity, and raw materials cannot immediately</p>
<p>be connected. It's truly easier said than done. Its innate conditions are really felt to be insufficient.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Hangzhou City Council and the Zhejiang Provincial Government repeatedly requested the central government to make Hangzhou</p>
<p>a municipality directly under the central government. Their reasons were: "Hangzhou is close to Nanjing and Shanghai, and far from Anhui and Jiangxi. Wheels and rails converge, and transportation is convenient. Since the completion of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, it has indeed controlled the key hub of water and land transportation in the southeast. Products from all regions gather here, so it economically forms a link in the national center region. As for scenic spots and scenery, they are especially known throughout the world." This means that Hangzhou does not have its unique personality. Let's look at Nanjing: it is a political city. Shanghai is an economic city. Beijing is a cultural city. They all have their unique personalities. We also revealed the current state statistics of Hangzhou above. In these statistics, there is nothing that is particularly emphasized. Therefore, we can know that Hangzhou is still extremely ordinary. Some people say that Hangzhou can become</p>
<p>a garden city, a place for Chinese and foreign people to visit. However, if it is only trees, flowers, pavilions, and buildings, without enriching its spirit and content, then tourists will also find it extremely ordinary. We know that the garden city of Geneva in Switzerland has put a lot of effort into its cultural cultivation. They have many prestigious academies established there. But in our Hangzhou, there are two universities, the highest institutions of learning, and two specialized schools, while cultural activities are unusually desolate.</p>
<p>Hangzhou's innate conditions are not suitable for being a commercial and industrial metropolis. On the contrary, Hangzhou's naturally quiet environment is suitable for research, cultivation, and writing. Therefore, we believe that it should be built into an ideal cultural city. The reporter had a long conversation with Professor Zhang Qiyun of Zhejiang University about the Hangzhou cultural city</p>
<p>ideal construction. He believes that houses can be built on the mountain peaks surrounding West Lake and along the Qiantang River for cultural workers to live and research, which will be cool even in the summer. I believe that research institutions should be established in Hangzhou. At the same time, cultural workers should be welcomed to live here. People in Hangzhou should not only cater to high officials and wealthy merchants but should especially respect cultural workers, and cultural activities should also be particularly strengthened. If Hangzhou really becomes an ideal cultural city, then the name of a municipality directly under the central government does not only need to be sought in political advancement, but its actual spirit will be incomparably sublime.

He was usually not on good terms with his mother-in-law and frequently argued, often being beaten. On the morning of the ninth of this month, a family dispute arose again, and Meizhen was again beaten and injured by her mother-in-law. Her father, Sheng Rongsheng, took her back to her parents' home. On the eleventh, her father-in-law, Lu Wenyu, personally went to the Sheng family to bring her back. However, less than two hours after arriving home, Meizhen suddenly died violently. The news spread far and wide, with some saying that she was strangled to death by her mother-in-law, while others said that she committed suicide by hanging. However, neither version could be confirmed. After the incident, the mother-in-law avoided meeting anyone, and the situation became even more sensational. Many pointed to it as a second Chu Fengdi case. When the corpse's family heard the news, they were extremely angry and led a crowd to Lu's house to reason with them and eat at Lu's expense. The Lu family could not bear it, and villagers gathered, arguing, leading to a mutual fight. Eight people from the Sheng family, including Tang and Song, were seriously injured, and the Lu family was also destroyed. On the fifteenth, the injured came to the local prosecutor's office to have their injuries examined. At the same time, the prosecutor's office immediately sent an examiner who determined that she had died by hanging. The corpse's family refuted this, expressing their disapproval. Prosecutor Wang solemnly stated that he would personally lead examiners and doctors from the public hospital to the countryside on the sixteenth for a re-examination.</p>

<p>Saying "Willing to Live Here"</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Taipei Sixteenth Air Dispatch] The Xinjiang dance troupe's journey east, from the northwest corner of China to the southeast corner of China, traversing the mainland hinterland and the Taiwan Strait, is magnificent.</p>
<p>After the Retrocession, the earliest relationship between Taiwan and Xinjiang was with General Zhang Zhizhong, who said that the construction of Taiwan should be moved to the Great Northwest. The second was Commissioner Boerhan, who was working on the construction of Taiwan and women, considering it the best phenomenon. The next would be the thirty-eight members of the Xinjiang Dance Troupe, the "Cultural Envoys." The Uyghurs, who grow up at the foot of</p>
<p>the Tianshan Mountains in the desert region, have a great dream of the sea. But when they crossed the treacherous strait, they were conquered by the sea. Not one of them was not seasick, and they collapsed as soon as they landed. There is a distance from the desert to the sea. In this long distance, the historical handshake between the people of the two poles is meaningful.</p>

They are also preparing to perform two more performances in the south. Receiving a grand welcome from all walks of life in the provincial capital is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The provincial government did not make a large-scale reception for this trip. They almost completely</p>

<p>Taiwanese people are estranged from the mainland. The arrival of the Xinjiang Dance Troupe will give the island new stimulation and influence in the recognition and cultural communication between ethnic groups. I believe that they will have a better stable impression of Taiwan's construction and take it to the Great Northwest. These two east-west sea and land gateways, these two edge ties, are linked together and closely connected! (This Newspaper's Special Correspondent Ding Mu Yun)</p>

<h3 id="e123">From the "Locust Policy" to the Xuzhou Refugees <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Xuzhou Fourteenth Dispatch] Due to its location and transportation, Xuzhou has become a city of refugees in name and reality. Righteous people exiled from Southern Shandong, Western Shandong, Eastern Henan, and Northern Jiangsu are all gathering in this big city, hoping to use the convenient and economical railway transportation to seek a livelihood in other safe cities. The highest recorded number of refugees concentrated in Xuzhou last year was as high as 220,000! The creation of artificial refugees is one of the strategies of the bandit army, which they call the "Locust Policy." Their intention is to deceive hundreds of thousands of women and children refugees into the government area, making them responsible for all the food and clothing expenses of these hungry people and unable to use their manpower. The astonishing consumption of food and other things, continuing for a long time, will greatly weaken the government's material strength, and its harm is like that of locusts to crops."</p>
<p>Transforming Refugees into Citizens</p>
<p>In theory, there are no refugees in Xuzhou today. Because starting last spring, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Jiangsu Provincial Government jointly decided to encourage righteous people to organize armed returning home teams to follow the government army into the recovered areas of Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu to rebuild their destroyed homes. For those who did not want to return home and wanted to stay in Xuzhou for a long time, the municipal government set out a method of "transforming refugees into citizens." After compiling temporary Baojia, the central and local governments are no longer responsible for relief. This policy has been implemented for a year, so when Mayor Luo of Xuzhou answered the questions of the press corps, he said that the refugees who had gathered in the city in the past had all become citizens, which is completely correct in theory. But has the refugee problem really been solved in fact? This can be seen from two aspects: First, the armed returning home teams had high expectations at the beginning of their organization, but after implementation, there were many problems. First of all, the self-defense ability of the returning home teams themselves is weak, completely relying on the protection of the army. But the army is often mobilized, and many counties in the war zone have been captured and overcome, which can be repeated three or four or even seven or eight times. In this case, the armed righteous people who returned home became the target of revenge by the bandit army, and their tragic experiences are unbearable to describe. Many righteous people who had already returned home, therefore, traveled long distances and returned to Xuzhou. This is the first situation.</p>
<p>Visiting the Righteous People's Area</p>
<p>Those righteous people who are willing to live in Xuzhou for a long time, they have become "citizens" in name, but what is their daily life like? In the five old refugee-concentrated areas in Xuzhou, the reporter also chose the largest one near the old airfield, with the gracious assistance of Lu Zong and the municipal government, to conduct a field investigation. My suspicion was confirmed.</p>
<p>This area has now been compiled into thirty-four and thirty-five Baos, with a total of 13,867 residents. They are all from Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, and in the past, it can be said that they all had meager assets. They began to be exiled in Xuzhou in the spring of thirty-five. After arriving, they built some houses on the site of the airfield with their own financial and human resources as shelters. The local Su Ning Relief Branch had allocated 100,000 yuan per household as subsidies. Due to the inequality of wealth, these righteous people's buildings are either more habitable adobe houses or thatched huts that are only one or even half a person tall, and the former only accounts for one-fifth of the total. One year later today, their living conditions have become unbearable. The light and air of the adobe houses are no longer discussed, but they are still suitable for human survival. As for the thatched hut area, one immediately feels like they are in hell as soon as they enter. The thatched hut is about three or four feet high, and the building materials are thatch and mud. Because the door is low, people have to crawl in and out. Some firewood and grass are spread on the ground, which is considered a bed. A thatched hut may house six or seven adults and children. This is already struggling on the edge of the human survival line. There is no hygiene to talk about, let alone decency. The thatched hut cannot cover the wind and rain. In these four days, Xuzhou's wind and rain are bitter and cold, and the women and children in the thatched hut are crying. I witnessed two dead bodies being buried in the midst of their families' crying. The living are also disheveled and unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Tragic Daily Life</p>
<p>Their food is bean cake mixed with sweet potato slices, which is the best, but it is not easy to obtain. After three days of rain, many people went hungry. After the arrival of American relief supplies in China, the Ministry of Social Affairs allocated twelve tons of wheat to the charitable organizations here to provide relief to the refugees here in the form of porridge. It is stipulated that each person can receive twelve taels per day, barely maintaining their lives. But the problem is that there is little porridge and many monks. In the area I visited, the population is 13,867, of which only fifty have received porridge relief!</p>
<p>The reporter only visited one area, but the situation in other areas can also be imagined. When the sweltering day comes, these thatched hut areas will inevitably become the source of the epidemic. Any conscientious person who witnesses the inhuman lives of these compatriots will sympathize with them and worry about them. The handling of refugees is an extremely serious issue. These are the refugees who have already settled down, and their lives are so hard, it is really unimaginable for those who are in exile. Recently, the bandit army in Northern Jiangsu has again moved. After Shuyang and other places were captured, 150,000 refugees were displaced and fled to the government military area to seek relief and protection. It is now reported that 110,000 people have arrived in Suqian. The local government troops, witnessing the suffering of their compatriots, out of human sympathy, automatically reduced their diet by one day to provide relief. Now, most of these refugees are heading towards Xuzhou. How to resettle and relieve them has become a major problem for the military and political organs here. Because the counties under Xuzhou already deeply feel the severity of the food shortage, they are now trying various ways to ask the Four Joint Offices for funds to purchase food. If they are unprepared and allow a large number of difficulties to enter, serious incidents will occur.</p>
<p>New Refugee Problems</p>
<p>The Xuzhou military and political authorities have been resettling the righteous people based on a principle instructed by the central government, which is that the righteous people can be dispersed to the east, west, and north, but they cannot take Jinbei cars to the south. Now, Xuzhou has five or six hundred new refugees arriving every day. The Ministry of Social Affairs has now allocated 1 billion yuan and 23 tons of flour to carry out relief and diversion work. There are two diversion stations here. When the righteous people arrive, they are responsible for their food and lodging, and they are given 30,000 to 50,000 yuan for travel expenses to send them back to their hometowns by free car. If they are homeless, they will be sent to live temporarily in the homes of relatives. According to the staff, most of the refugees hope to go to the Beijing-Shanghai area, where it is easier to make a living, but this is not possible now. Under the current situation, everything is a temporary measure, and a fundamental solution is really out of the question.</p>
<p>The central government's reluctance to allow refugees to go south has its own difficulties because the political and economic heartland south of the Yangtze River today cannot tolerate any disturbance. In fact, in terms of employment opportunities, righteous people who are unfamiliar with the people and places in Jiangnan may not be comforted either. The righteous people in the thirty-four Baos here have now proposed a self-help method, including the establishment of refugee schools, refugee markets, small loan cooperatives, job placement agencies, hospitals, and household registration statistics, and have submitted them to the Xuzhou military and political organs for approval. This is worthy of sympathy from the social community. At the same time, on the other hand, powerful people in safe areas today should also bravely help others. If they have the opportunity to see the suffering of the righteous people here and think about the overall situation today, it will not be difficult to realize that leveling the distance between people's lives is the fundamental way to maintain this social system.

<p>[This Newspaper's Wuxi Sixteenth Dispatch] Wuxi is a scenic city with developed industry and commerce, bordering the 36,000-hectare Taihu Lake. The lake water is vast and clear as a mirror, and there are seventy-two small islands dotting it, so it is called a blessed land. Famous scenic spots such as Yuantouzhu, Xiaojishan, Liyuan, Meiyuan, Yuzhuang, Shijie Bridge, Huiquan Mountain, Xishan, Xuelang Mountain, and Jiangshan have picturesque scenery that can attract tourists to linger. Moreover, transportation is convenient, with roads reaching all directions. During this spring season, tourist groups from all over the world travel to the Taihu Lake scenic area in groups, one after another, and many have the feeling of being happy and forgetting to return. Taihu Lake has abundant products, such as water chestnuts, lotus roots, fish, and shrimp, all of which have delicious and palatable flavors. Recently, tourists from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line have been arriving in an endless stream. Note: There are more than 100 inns in Xiyi, most of which are near the railway station along Tongyun Road. The largest range is the Taishan Hotel (near the Gongyun Bridge), the China Hotel (Tongyun Road), and the Jinghu Hotel (Tongyun Road). The next are Zhongnan, Huizhong, Xinhua, Garden, Nanyang, Park, and more than ten others. The highest daily room rate is around 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and the lowest is around 200,000 yuan. The oldest brand of restaurants is Jufengyuan. The store is located outside the north city wall and is a must-pass for tourists. It is reported that the highest price for a set of dishes is 3.5 million yuan, and the lowest is 1 million yuan. In addition, fresh and live large carp and large shrimp are more than 200,000 yuan. The next is Yingbin Building in the city. The store was particularly prosperous during the war. Unfortunately, the major shareholder is the well-known traitor Li Zongtang, and the court is still investigating. The most luxurious restaurant is the Taihu Restaurant in the Taishan Hotel, which offers both Chinese and Western dishes. Other restaurants such as Yingchunyuan, Wanli, Yanbinlou, and Yang Tianxing are slightly inferior to the above-mentioned restaurants in terms of the whole table, and the "snack bar" business is the most prosperous. Xifuli on Dashi Bridge is also often full of guests. (This Newspaper's Reporter Shi Wuwei)</p>

During the luncheon, Acting Director Li stated that the social and economic conditions are currently poor, and the number of out-of-school children is increasing daily. The Bureau of Education should take responsibility for resolving this issue. Regarding other issues related to education, he expressed the hope that all sectors would contact the Bureau at any time, and they would be willing to do their best to resolve them. As for needy students in primary and secondary schools in the city who require free admission, Li solemnly stated that he would be very willing to help verify and grant them free admission with the schools. Regarding the issue of school fees, Li advocated not restricting them, but rather having wealthier parents pay more tuition to support the schools and expand the number of free places, so that needy students could also have the opportunity to study. This proposal is planned to be implemented starting next semester. Li then reported on the tuition situation for this semester: six schools, including the Teachers' College, Kindergarten Teachers' College, Women's Teachers' College, Xinlu Normal School, Physical Education Teachers' College, and Nursing School, do not charge tuition; the tuition collected by municipal secondary schools is very small, 40,000 yuan for junior high and 60,000 yuan for senior high.

<p>Yesterday, the hearts of Hua shareholders were still extremely excited, forging ahead bravely. Yongsha immediately reached a new high price of 1,835 yuan. Seven stocks, including Guohuo, Xinhua, Jinglun, and Qinxing, rose to their limit. However, Yongsha retreated after reaching its high before closing, indicating a possible reaction.</p>
<p>The morning opening was flat. With the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, Yongsha appeared with a price of 1,720 yuan and was initially pushed to 1,730 yuan, then retreated to 1,695 yuan and 1,710 yuan. There were purchases in the middle, pushing it up to 1,740 yuan and 1,770 yuan. However, due to tight credit, there was a tendency to sell, causing it to fall to a low price of 1,667 yuan and 1,694 yuan. Near noon, cotton cloth saw another jump, with traders rushing to deliver. People in the industry had high hopes and gambled on the immediate delivery of yarn. The difference between spot and tomorrow delivery was as much as 50 yuan. At noon closing, Yongsha rose to 1,730 yuan and 1,775 yuan, and Qinxing and Xinhua hit their limit.

Small stocks saw more profit, with Jinglun, Xinhua, Guohuo, Lian, Qinxing, and Xinyi hitting their limit. Unexpectedly, in the last moment before closing, there were more sellers, and the sentiment changed.

<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened lower in the morning due to tight credit and sales by the industry, causing prices to decline. After the noon close, sentiment firmed again due to the higher foreign exchange rate, and buying interest revived. As a result, ten-piece British Old Knife brand cigarettes and two types of tobacco rebounded by 5.3 million and 4.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other Chinese-brand cigarettes also rose by 5,000 to 30,000 yuan, and American-brand cigarettes and fifty-piece canned cigarettes also jumped up by 5,000 to 15%.</p>
<p>In the daily necessities soap market, there were more sellers than buyers in the morning. In the afternoon, buying activity increased due to the higher foreign exchange rate. As a result, Guben Soap rebounded by 200,000 yuan, Arrow Knife rose by 50,000 yuan, and the markets for Xiangmao and Guanghua also strengthened. However, matches remained weak, while kerosene and candles were stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday's raw cotton market saw upward sentiment due to the rebound in cotton cloth prices. With easing credit, cargo owners were bullish, and the Shanghai Yarn Control Committee's purchase prices also took into account market conditions and were moderately increased. Transactions were slightly busier than the previous day. Shashi opened at 17.25 million, 17.15 million, Hankou fine lint at 15.95 million, Fire Machine at 14.40 million. The above are all public warehouse prices. Zhoupu seed cotton was 3.5 million.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Da Feng and Other Factories: Cotton Allocation Decided <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association held a standing council meeting yesterday. Due to the shortage of raw cotton for the Da Feng, Zhao Feng, Hexing, and Guoxin yarn factories, it was resolved to send Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, and five others to the Shanghai Yarn Control Committee to request allocation from Chairman Yuan. The result was very satisfactory, and Chairman Yuan agreed to allocate one month's worth of cotton to the above four yarn factories according to their needs. The yarn-for-cotton ratio will be decided at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The allocation to other factories will be determined after investigating their actual monthly needs.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Rice Prices Continue to Fall: Flour and Cooking Oil Rise <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, tight credit continued, and the rice market struggled to recover. Although the foreign exchange rate had been increased to 250,000 yuan, a rise of over 30%, the positive news did not stimulate sentiment. The price decline in the northern market was more severe than in the southern market, with a difference of 100,000 yuan between the two markets. White japonica rice opened at 3.35 million in the southern market and 3.45 million in the northern market. The former fell by 50,000, and the latter fell by 150,000. In total, the southern market was down by about 50,000 yuan, and the northern market was down by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, with thin rice falling the most, by 200,000. The total arrivals in the two markets were 8,417 shi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>In the early market, prices were unstable due to tight credit and were similar to the previous market. When news of the foreign exchange loosening spread to the market, more buyers appeared, and the northern merchants chose to bring in the old transport ship flour and the market improved. As a result, transport ship flour rose by 20,000 yuan, old army flour was 10,000 yuan higher, and other miscellaneous brands of flour were 10,000 to 20,000 yuan higher. Wheat bran rose by 10,000 yuan in the early market, and remained at 800,000 yuan in the later market.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Declines outnumbered gains. Soybean oil factories bought slightly, white soybeans were flat, and vehicle soybeans rose by 50,000 yuan. Picked green soybeans rose by 20,000 yuan, and sandy red soybeans fell sharply by 200,000 yuan. Corn cargo owners were unwilling to sell cheaply due to the high cost of arrivals from the producing areas. Northern merchants slightly increased their purchases of high-quality goods, and the market was slightly up by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Raw kernels were low, at 10,000 to 150,000 yuan, red sorghum was slightly up by 30,000 yuan, and there was no price difference for tea beans.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices hovered and trended higher. Local streets saw some buying at low prices. Good Bucket raw oil rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Dayouyu soybean oil opened at 6.9 million yuan and rose to 6.95 million yuan at closing, an increase of 80,000 yuan. Clear oil was 150,000 yuan higher. Raw sesame oil and small-cart oil had no price difference. Soybean cake was flat at the opening, but the market rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan in the afternoon due to customers buying.</p>
<h3 id="e172">National Cement Association: Urges Allocation of Foreign Exchange <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The National Cement Association, in view of the increasing domestic cement production and the urgent need to expand foreign sales, yesterday submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Export Management Committee, requesting that all foreign exchange earned from foreign sales be allocated to exporting manufacturers for the purchase of equipment and raw materials. The association also scheduled to appoint representatives this morning to visit Chairman Huo of the Export Management Committee and Director Chen Junren to personally present all the details.</p>
<p>The association's original report stated: The national cement production has now reached 115,900 metric tons per month, and will continue to increase sharply thereafter. However, domestic sales are currently sluggish, and the Southeast Asia, Philippines, Middle East, and Africa regions are eagerly awaiting our exports due to restrictions on British and American cement exports. The main bottleneck preventing foreign sales at present is the excessive difference in the current exchange rate. The foreign sales price, when converted to legal tender, is not even half of the cost. Therefore, it is hoped that all foreign exchange obtained from foreign sales can be allocated to exporting manufacturers for the purchase of equipment and the import of gypsum paper bags and other raw materials. In this way, the production needs of each factory can be fully supplied, and the manufacturing cost can be greatly reduced, thereby competing with other countries' products in the international market.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Cotton Yarn Rebounds on Increased Buying: Off-Market Sentiment for Piece Goods is Buoyant <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market initially saw weak sentiment, with prices hovering at low levels. Later, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate had suddenly increased again by about 30%, and the previous day's decline was too large, buying interest slightly stirred. Merchants from Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and other places started buying, and both industry insiders and outsiders came to buy as soon as they saw sellers. There was a clamor of buying in the market, and the market became more in demand than supply, with prices showing strength again.</p>
<p>Forty-two count Allied Phoenix fine yarn, initially priced at 160 million, rose steadily to close at 177 million yuan, a rebound of 19 million yuan compared to the previous day. Twenty-one count Shuangma single yarn, with strong short covering and the stabilizing forces taking the opportunity to push up prices, soared to a new high of 105 million yuan, a surge of 16 million. Present-day horse yarn also jumped 17 million to close at 108 million. In addition, 40-count and 32-count yarns all rose by 5-6 million to 10 million, and 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count coarse yarns all rebounded by about 10%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was flat at the opening, and with tight credit in the market, selling pressure was still high. Northern merchants and Shanxi merchants sold heavily, and prices generally declined. Nengtou fine cloth initially priced at 3.55 million yuan, fell straight to 510,000 with sellers, and then Hankou merchants took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and prices rebounded to 580,000. Later, at around 10 o'clock, there was a brief commotion due to the higher foreign exchange rate, but with credit still tight, industry insiders took advantage of the high prices to sell heavily, and scattered investors also competed to sell, and the market saw a decline again.</p>
<p>By noon closing, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth closed at a low price of 3.52 million, a further decline of 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Yanghe, Caiqiu, Wufu, and other fine cloths also gradually declined by 40,000, 50,000, and 70,000 yuan. Pique, due to reduced sales, saw even more sellers, falling by about 100,000, while the rest of the cloth market trended stable.</p>
<p>It was also reported that after the close of the second cloth market, off-market news of the sharp rise in cotton banknotes and securities spread, and sentiment suddenly became buoyant. Buyers from all sides rushed to buy, with Longtou fine cloth gradually rising to 3.6 million yuan for spot goods, and 3.65 million yuan for tomorrow's delivery with eager buyers. Hankou merchants bought a lot of pique, and Four Gentlemen also rose to about 3.5 million.</p>

<p>Yesterday's timber market, with higher foreign exchange rates and slightly looser credit, saw increased sales and a trend towards strength, with fir rebounding. Large strips rose to 20,000 yuan per foot, small strips 19,000 yuan. Yangsong also rebounded, with square pieces and slices both rising to 95,000 yuan per foot. Teak's domestic sales were not weak, rising to 250,000 yuan per foot. Cypress also improved to 100,000 yuan per foot, a gain of about 10-20%.</p>

<p>Female-colored fabrics in red, yellow, blue, green, cyan, purple, hidden yuan, and gray have seen active sales recently, especially those that are plain and soft in texture. Local and foreign buyers have been adding to their purchases, and sales at various stores continue to be active. At the same time, short and long overcoats are in season, and transactions have therefore been increasing steadily. Yesterday, top-grade female-colored cheongsam fabric was priced at 2.2 million yuan per yard, second-grade at 1.6-1.7 million yuan, third-grade at 1.2-1.3 million yuan, and fourth-grade at 8-900,000 yuan, with sales of high-end and mid-range fabrics being the most active.</p>

<p>Due to strong demand from French Africa, exports of tea are more satisfactory to exporters. Other domestic varieties are also continuing to be sold by local merchants and foreign merchants, and buying interest remains high. However, since inventories have not decreased, holders remain reluctant to sell. Transactions have decreased again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Shantou merchant brought over 300 pieces of clams, which were shipped by the Bohai steamship and discharged at the Huashun Wharf without being able to unload at the fish market. The market specially hired a small boat to transport them into the market.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Four-Four Dictionary <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Xin</p>
<p>(Compiled and published by Yao Zhongba, 504 pages,</p>
<p>Priced at 150 yuan)</p>
<p>What does this dictionary, called the "Four-Four Dictionary," mean? In the foreword, it is stated: "The compiler, after studying the structure of modern Chinese characters, believes that all strokes can be classified into four categories. Therefore, this dictionary is compiled based on the principle of these four categories of strokes. First, the characters are classified according to the four categories of strokes, then divided into sections according to the four categories of strokes; then arranged in order according to the four categories of strokes; and finally, characters are searched according to the sequence of the four categories of strokes, hence the name 'Four-Four Dictionary'." These words explain the origin of its name.</p>
<p>In the compilation instructions, the opening sentence states: "The compilation of this dictionary is based on the following four objectives: First, the strokes of modern characters should be the standard for division. Second, the radicals should have a fixed position. Third, the number of radicals should be simplified. Fourth, the number of strokes for character searching should be simplified." Now, let's discuss these four points first.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the so-called "modern character form" does not refer to regular script, but rather to Song typeface. If Song typeface is considered a modern character form, then what is regular script? This statement seems to have a linguistic flaw and should be corrected first.</p>
<p>It is correct that the strokes of modern character forms (whether Song typeface or regular script) can be classified into four categories. The so-called four categories are dot (·), horizontal (一), vertical (｜), and left-falling stroke (丿). These are not Yao's inventions. According to the old indexing methods in our country, some people had already used "Jiang Shan Qian Gu" (江山千古, meaning —丿一) and "Yuan Heng Li Zhen" (元亨利貞, meaning 一｜丿一) and others. Among the new methods, taking "Han Lai Shu Wang" (寒來署往, meaning 丶一—丿) as the beginning as the scope of strokes is not uncommon.</p>
<p>In reality, the actual types of strokes are not just four: dot, horizontal, vertical, and left-falling stroke. Yao's method of classification follows the principle of considering variant forms, separated forms, and disregarding hooks. For example, ㇆ in 趣 is considered a variant of horizontal (一), and 捺 (㇏) is considered a variant of dot (·). Classifying 捺 into the dot category and ㇆ into the horizontal category adopts the first principle of classification. Also, in the character "一乃," which is usually written with three strokes, it is treated as 一 vertical, horizontal, vertical, left-falling stroke, adopting the second principle of classification. Hooks, such as the hook in the second stroke of characters like 丁, are not considered strokes, adopting the third principle of classification. Looking at the stroke classification table in this dictionary, it becomes clearer. However, classifying the short horizontal stroke in the second stroke of the characters "上" (up) and "止" (stop) into the dot category feels inconsistent with reality. Separating the joined stroke in "一灣" (a bay) is very consistent with scientific principles, but it is somewhat unaccustomed in practice. Yao states that "hooks are not considered strokes because they are irrelevant to indexing." If "干" (dry) and "于" (at/in/to) are encountered, they differ only by a hook. Is it truly irrelevant to indexing? If the principle of disregarding hooks is accepted, then vertical hooks and horizontal hooks should be treated equally. However, the horizontal hook in 一宀一 and the horizontal hook in "疋" are both classified as left-falling strokes. Isn't this self-contradictory? Therefore, the classification and selection of strokes are still open for discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, in the old radical system, the position of the radicals was not fixed, sometimes on the left, sometimes on the right, sometimes above, sometimes below, sometimes in the middle, sometimes on the outside, making it difficult to grasp and causing aversion, which was inevitable. Here, except for "乏" (lack), "冂" (enclosure), "鬥" (fight), "門" (gate), and "勹" (embrace) as exceptions, all use the three positions of "above," "left," and "upper left corner" as radicals. This kind of regulation is agreed upon by everyone.</p>
<p>However, specifying the position of radicals does not solve all problems within the radicals. Because radicals, in addition to their position in a character, also have characteristics of organization and structure. To clarify this issue, it is necessary to address the third point mentioned above. For the sake of convenience, it will be incorporated into the discussion in the next section.</p>
<p>Regarding the third point, the simplification of the number of radicals has reduced them from 214 to 90. What methods did Yao use to simplify them? It was simplified by adopting the methods of merging old radicals and adding new radicals. The so-called "adopting" refers to adopting old radicals, such as "氵" (water), "雨" (rain), "門" (gate), "竹" (bamboo), etc. The so-called "merging" refers to merging old radicals, for example, merging "立" (stand) into "亠" (lid), merging "走" (walk) into "土" (earth), merging "曰" (say) into "日" (sun), merging "月" (moon) into "月" (moon), etc. The so-called "adding new radicals" refers to the new additions of 一, "主" (master), "业" (industry), "×" (cross), etc. Statistically, out of the 90 radicals, 75 are old and 15 are new. From this perspective, this dictionary can be said to be a dictionary that improves the radical system.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of radicals is the clarity of their names and the clarity of their relationship with their radical tails. For example, it is universally known that the Li (李) character is separated into "木" (wood) and "子" (child), and the Chen (陳) character is separated into "阝" (mound) and "東" (east). The Kangxi Dictionary has 214 radicals, each with its own sound and meaning. But in this dictionary, many new radicals are named arbitrarily. For example, 一, 一丨, 一, "人" (person), "亻" (person), "鳥" (bird), 一, etc. are named arbitrarily, and the relationship between the radical and the radical tail in the characters contained in these radicals does not have a clear boundary. For example, we say "弓長" (bow long) is Zhang (張), which is very clear. But now the Zhang character is classified under the "㇟" radical. What are the remaining radical tail "張"?</p>
<p>Also, how many characters should a radical ideally contain? This cannot be determined by subjective preferences, but should be balanced by objective needs. Statistically speaking, these 90 radicals here contain a total of 9,690 characters, with an average of about 176 characters per radical. But the actual distribution is:</p>
<p>Number of Characters Number of Radicals</p>
<p>1-50 33</p>
<p>51-100 22</p>
<p>101-150 20</p>
<p>151-200 5</p>
<p>201-250 2</p>
<p>251-300 2</p>
<p>301-350 1</p>
<p>351-400 1</p>
<p>401-450 1</p>
<p>451-500 1</p>
<p>Among them, the smallest is the "鬥" (fight) radical, with only seven characters; the largest is the "氵" (water) radical, with 553. If seven characters can establish a radical, then why not establish radicals for those that contain more than seven characters and whose radicals and radical tails do have distinct forms, such as "方" (square), "豕" (pig), "卄" (twenty), "廴" (long stride), "虍" (tiger), "缶" (earthenware), "矢" (arrow), "角" (horn), "身" (body), "鬼" (ghost), etc.?</p>
<p>In addition, for entire characters that cannot be separated and whose strokes are intertwined or connected, such as the character "事" (matter), which used to be in the "亅" (hook) radical, is now in the "十" (ten) radical; the character "果" (fruit), which used to be in the "木" (wood) radical, is now in the "田" (field) radical; the character "年" (year), which used to be in the "千" (thousand) radical, is now in the "人" (person) radical; and "甘" (sweet), which used to be a radical, is now in the "卄" (twenty) radical. Comparatively, except for the improvement in the radical classification of the character "年" (year), isn't the rest just the pot calling the kettle black?</p>
<p>Regarding the fourth point of simplifying the strokes for character searching, Yao only divides them into dot, horizontal, vertical, and left-falling stroke and does not arrange the other strokes that are classified into these four categories in order, which is not strict enough. Furthermore, in the same category or the same radical, the order only considers the first four strokes and not the strokes after the fourth stroke, which feels too bound by the word "four." For example, in the dot category radicals, the "冫" (ice) radical is placed before the "㇟" radical, which is the former example. Also, the order of the seven radicals "門口足日目貝口" (gate mouth foot sun eye shell mouth) in the vertical category radicals only considers the first four strokes, resulting in a chaotic phenomenon, which is the latter example.</p>
<p>There is also one more point that needs to be mentioned, which is the issue of stroke order. According to ordinary rules, the principle is from top to bottom and from left to right. The character "竹" (bamboo) in this dictionary is classified under the "" radical. Then the stroke order of the character "竹" (bamboo) is 丿一丨一一, without any doubt. By analogy, the stroke order of the "竹" (bamboo) radical should of course be 丿一丨一. However, in the left-falling stroke category radicals, "竹" (bamboo) is placed after "人" (person). What is the reason for this? As for the example of using the principle of duplication when the first stroke of other characters has two branches, that is very correct. Yao said:</p>
<p>However, the quality of a dictionary is not determined solely by the convenience of searching. In addition, the richness of the vocabulary and the timeliness of the explanations must also be considered. Regarding the vocabulary of this dictionary, excluding the 37 characters that are used only as radicals, a total of 9,653 characters are recorded. Yao did not specify the basis for these characters, but judging from the use of telegrams, it is probably based on the telegram number book. Commonly used characters are likely included.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the strengths of this dictionary are that the vocabulary is fairly rich and the explanations are timely. However, in terms of indexing, it has not reached the level of "easy to search." It is hoped that Yao will make further corrections and improvements, and there may be a way out in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Western Trends <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Juzhen</p>
<p>Recently, I saw an article in a magazine reviewing Mr. Jiang Menglin's recent book "Western Trends." The book was originally titled "Tides from the West" and published by Yale University. Here is an introduction to the main points of the review:</p>
<p>It is difficult to tell whether Dr. Jiang Menglin wrote this book with the attitude of an educator or that of a politician. This is an autobiography written in fluent and fresh English. He appropriately calls it "Western Trends." He was born in 1884 in a village not far from Ningbo, where transportation was convenient and there were many opportunities to come into contact with Shanghai, the cultural center of the West at that time. In his childhood, he saw houses destroyed by the Taiping Army, heard about the Wuxu Coup in Beijing, and heard the call for "new people."</p>
<p>At that time, the traditional lessons for scholars were the Four Books and Five Classics. Mr. Jiang also received this education. Later, he entered a new-style school, learned English, and accepted Western culture. He graduated from Columbia University in the United States and received a Ph.D. in philosophy. At that time, the heroes of China were Sun Yat-sen, Liang Qichao, and Cai Yuanpei. Mr. Jiang finally joined the Kuomintang and pledged allegiance to the party leader, President Chiang. The Chinese Communist Party considered him a reactionary, so he was very resentful of communism. He criticized the communist land reform policy, believing it was merely a deformed version of President Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>He spared no effort in attacking the Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. He believed that Shanghai was extremely depraved, only cared about money, exploited and extorted, and was an abyss of sin. He compared Beijing and Shanghai. In Beijing, he served as the president of a national university for fifteen years. He believed that Beijing was the true paradise for artists, philosophers, and scholars. He described this world-famous ancient capital in great detail. Readers will surely find great pleasure in this chapter. This is Mr. Jiang's most proud place.</p>
<p>It seems inappropriate to criticize this book for those who do not fully understand the ideological revolution and social development of this extraordinary era. But we always want to see the truth of the Chinese situation at that time. This kind of demand will definitely be disappointed, because Jiang Guangzeng really wrote too briefly.</p>
<h3 id="e181">An Overview of Xinjiang <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenda</p>
<p>— Written by Su, Published by Independent Publishing House</p>
<p>The area of Xinjiang Province is 1,711,931 square kilometers, making it the largest province in the country, almost four times the size of Sichuan, sixteen times the size of Zhejiang, and fifty times the size of Taiwan. As for its population, according to the figures released by the Population Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior in July 1947, it is 4,012,330 people, accounting for only 0.7% of the national population. However, in fertile areas, the population density can reach more than 300 people per square kilometer. Since the resources of the entire province have not been fully developed, the future construction prospects of Xinjiang should not be ignored. However, construction must understand the geographical environment, otherwise it will be counterproductive and incompatible. Professor Ding Xiao's book "An Overview of Xinjiang" can be used as an excellent reference book. Therefore, despite my ignorance, I will introduce it.</p>
<p>This book is based on the author's travel and investigation in Xinjiang from May to October 1943. The journey covered both the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, passing through 42 counties. All important places in Xinjiang are included in the book, so the name "An Overview of Xinjiang" is fitting.</p>
<p>This book has a total of 94 pages divided into 12 chapters. The first chapter is on administrative divisions, describing the administrative regions of Dihua, Yili, Tacheng, Ashan, Hami, Yanqi, Kashgar, Aksu, Shache, and Hiemin separately.</p>
<p>The second chapter describes the area and population of Xinjiang. Xinjiang's area accounts for about one-seventh of the country's area, but its population is very small, with an average population density of only three people per square kilometer. However, in fertile arable areas, the density can reach 358 people per square kilometer. In terms of occupational distribution, farmers account for about 35% to 40%, and herders account for about 20%. The population distribution is denser in the south and sparser in the north.</p>
<p>The third chapter is on natural divisions. People usually divide Xinjiang's natural areas into Northern Xinjiang and Southern Xinjiang, but this division ignores the Tianshan Mountains, the Altai Mountains, and the Kunlun Mountains. The author divides Xinjiang's natural areas into six regions and twenty sub-regions based on topography and geological structure.</p>
<p>1. Northern Mountain Plateau Region - A. Altai Mountains B. Bulgen Plateau C. Buruzin Plain D. Tacheng Plateau.</p>
<p>2. Northern Xinjiang Basin - A. Suilai Basin B. Ebi Lake Plain.</p>
<p>3. Tianshan Mountain Region - A. Tianshan Mountains B. Yili Plain C. Zhenxi Basin D. Turpan Basin E. Baicheng Basin F. Ushi Plain.</p>
<p>4. Southern Xinjiang Basin - Tarim Basin.</p>
<p>5. Northern Mountain Region - A. Xingxingxia Plateau B. Bainendui Plateau C. Kuruktag D. Maqi Basin.</p>
<p>6. Kunlun Mountain Region - A. Kunlun Mountains B. Pamir Plateau C. Northern Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter is on climate. Xinjiang is located in the Central Asian continent, with a continental climate. The north is slightly humid, while the southern desert is extremely dry. This chapter is further divided into sections on temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloud cover, wind and sand, and solar radiation.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter is on geology and minerals. The two basins of Xinjiang are ancient land. In the early Paleozoic era, the Tianshan, Altai, and Kunlun Mountains were all oceans. During the later Caledonian orogeny, the Altai Mountains rose in the north. At the end of the Paleozoic era, the Kunlun and Tianshan Mountains rose again. The Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains were all formed by the influence of the orogenic movement and became compressed fault mountains. Later, due to the influence of the Himalayan movement, the entire Xinjiang Province became a basin shape, and the climate became dry due to the surrounding high mountains.</p>
<p>Xinjiang's minerals include iron, coal, and oil. At the end of this chapter, the author also discusses industrial construction, saying that Xinjiang's minerals are very dispersed. However, the area covered by Jinghe, Gongha, Yanqi, and Kuqa is relatively rich and concentrated in minerals. All iron, oil, zinc, lead, and other minerals have mining value. Although lacking coal, Gongha has 260,000 horsepower of hydropower, and Yanqi has 160,000 horsepower of hydropower that can be used. Moreover, the Yanqi and Gongha grasslands are vast, agriculture and animal husbandry are prosperous, and the three agricultural areas of Dihua, Yili, and Aksu are very close. Therefore, the future development of industry should belong to this area. These opinions can be used as a reference for the construction of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter is on agriculture. Due to the climate in Xinjiang, the rainfall in Northern Xinjiang is slightly abundant, suitable for both farming and animal husbandry. However, the climate is cold and the growing season is short, so animal husbandry is more important than agriculture. The rainfall in Southern Xinjiang is scarce, but the climate is relatively mild and the growing season is longer. Agriculture is concentrated in fertile fields, using snowmelt for irrigation. The main crops are wheat, rice, corn, cotton, silk, and fruits.</p>
<p>The eighth chapter is on handicrafts, with Hotan as the main area. The main industries are silk weaving, Luopu carpets, jade, etc. The Yili area has the most modern industries.</p>
<p>Chapters nine to eleven are on residents, describing the evolution of residents, the Uyghurs, the Kyrgyz, and the Kazakhs separately.</p>
<p>The twelfth chapter discusses the possibility of immigration to Xinjiang. Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated. Therefore, future construction lacks people, making construction difficult to promote. For the sake of construction, immigration is necessary. But what is the possibility of immigration? Based on water sources and farmland, the author estimates that 14 million people can be immigrated, and states that the construction of water conservancy and transportation is absolutely important in the future. This immigration issue is of great importance to the construction of Xinjiang and deserves our attention.</p>
<p>At the end of this book, there are three appendices: one is the Keru tribe, one is the three parts of the Kazakhs, and one is the railway plan. In the railway plan, the author plans to build three main lines - Lanzhou-Yining Line, Baotou-Hami Line, Lanzhou-Shufu Line, and thirteen branch lines - (1) Anxi-Ruoqiang Line, (2) Anxi-Korla Line, (3) Hami-Korla Line, (4) Dihua-Korla Line, (5) Dihua-Tacheng Line, (6) Dihua-Ashan Line, (7) Zhenxi-Hami Line, (8) Zhenxi-Dihua Line, (9) Korla-Shufu Line, (10) Aksu-Heqiao Line, (11) Korla-Ruoqiang Line, (12) Aksu-Yarkand Line, (13) Zhenxi-Ashan Line.</p>
<p>This book has 27 tables and two maps - an administrative regional map and a natural regional map. However, it seems that there are too few maps. Books on geography should emphasize both pictures and texts. Otherwise, too few maps can make readers feel inconvenient. It is hoped that the author can remedy this.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Introducing Two Collections of Paintings <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Congzhou</p>
<p>(The First Collection of Recent Works by Layman Daqian, Collection of Paintings by Xie Zhiliu, Glass Plate Edition, Sold by China Painting Garden on Chengdu Road)</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, although the publishing industry has not recovered to the state before the war in terms of literary collections, the quality and quantity have reached a considerable level, and we cannot but congratulate the art world. However, what about painting collections? They are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. As far as I know, in the part of special collections, only three or five kinds were published last year. In addition to Zhang Daqian's Linfu Dunhuang First Collection, Wang Geyi's Collection, and Huang Junbi's Collection, there are only Zhang Shidaqian's Recent Works First Collection and Xie Zhiliu's Painting Collection, which have been published recently. Because the styles of the two are similar, I will introduce them together:</p>
<p>Zhang Daqian is known to the world for being able to imitate Shi Tao so realistically that he became famous at home and abroad. Since going to Dunhuang, he has gone from imitating the brushstrokes of the Yuan and Ming dynasties to regulating Song Dynasty painting and tracing back to the Six Dynasties. Several collections were published before the war, and the style was square and natural, different from today. The paintings he imitated were limited to figure paintings. Now this collection of twelve paintings includes landscapes, flowers and birds, figures, and walking animals. From the collection, we can see the path of research and the subject matter in painting in recent years. In addition to going to Dunhuang, he also recently examined the old collections of the Forbidden City, such as Bei Yuan's Xiao Xiang Map, Song Dynasty's Endless Rivers and Mountains Map, and Gu Hongzhong's Night Banquet Map. These famous works of the Tang and Song dynasties are all major ends in the records of ancient books. Not only are the original books unavailable, but now Zhang Shi's imitations have become the most truthful things in the world! In the collection, we can see such as Imitating Tang Painting Scattered Flowers, Bei Yuan Spring City叠嶂 (overlapping peaks), Han Gan Night Illumination White Picture, which are like facing the ancient books, and none of them is easily and hastily copied from. All the works have ancient people's brushstrokes and everywhere has a source. The printing is also very exquisite, and connoisseurs can use it for collection, and art school students can use it for copying. Although the true copy of Lanting is not visible, Chu Suiliang's silk copy is enough to be valued by the world!</p>
<p>Professor Zhiliu from Zhongda has deep attainments in Chinese painting, half of which is due to talent and half to academic strength. The Wang family of Wujin has always been famous for its literature. His brother Wang Cen's poetry and his sister Yue Mei's freehand flower and bird paintings are all known to the world. Therefore, only in such a good environment can such talents be produced. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he roamed the Northwest and went to Dunhuang with Zhang Shi to observe the murals of the Six Dynasties, Sui and Tang Dynasties. He returned to teach at the Imperial Academy of Bai Xia, and in art education, he did use the right track to enlighten future generations, without being affected by the pre- and post-Hai schools and Western paintings. He learned from the ancients. His flower and bird painting method is admired by people, and the fineness of outlining and coloring is rare today. The landscapes are majestic, quiet, and far-reaching, and the figures follow Lao Lian and enter the room of the Tang Dynasty. It is indeed rare to be a teacher with such skill. Unfortunately, he left Zhongda last autumn in response to Mr. Cheng Cangbo's invitation. This collection of books can be regarded as a souvenir for leaving Zhongda with his classmates! The collection includes twelve landscapes, figures, flowers and birds, all-encompassing. I love the Autumn Pond Picture, Red Tree Bamboo Birds, Moss Branches Adorned with Jade, and Pinggang Aishuang.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Principles of Chemistry <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qiande</p>
<p>(Principles of Chemistry by J.H. Hildebrand, Translated and compiled by Cao Huiqun, One of the Yi You Academy Series, Published by Zhonghua Book Company)</p>
<p>China has always been a country with backward science, so there are very few works on science, and even translations are not very many. In this way, most of the science textbooks used by general high schools or above are original Western texts. As a result, Chinese young students suffer a lot and suffer a lot, because they have to spend half of their time studying linguistics, so the effect they get is certainly not 100%. Under such conditions, translated books are indeed closely related to the future of China.</p>
<p>Principles of Chemistry, except for some parts about naming that were adapted by the translator, the rest are taken from J.H. Hildbrand's Principles of Chemistry.</p>
<p>This book is divided into twenty chapters, and each chapter talks about different topics. In terms of content, there is no doubt that it focuses on theoretical things, and what is said are some of the most basic laws of general chemistry. These laws are also the most headache for students, but why do students have headaches? Although the law itself is a major reason, the writing style of the book author also has a considerable relationship.</p>
<p>Principles of Chemistry is completely different from ordinary chemistry books. For example, the third child talks about "Kinetic Theory of Gases". It not only explains all the general properties of gases clearly, but also uses diagrams to express many laws related to gases completely, and reveals them without leaving any trace, so that readers do not feel a bit of difficulty and dryness; such as Boyle's Law, there are two simple diagrams in this chapter to show the relationship between pressure and volume, because the entire Boyle's Law is just saying that "when the temperature is constant, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure," that is (PV=p.v. or V=Con.tant). There are also other theoretical points such as "when the temperature is constant, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its concentration", which is rarely found in ordinary chemistry books. What's better is to use the phenomenon of collision of various mixed gases with the wall to illustrate Dalton's Law of Partial pressure.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, "The Relationship between Chemical Properties and Physical Properties and Atomic Structure", the reason why metals are easy to transmit electricity is explained by "because elements with few electrons in the outermost layer are extremely relaxed in absorbing electrons in the solid state", and the so-called transmitting electricity is the mutual transmission of electrons. Moreover, the three effects of the electric field on molecules are shown very clearly in a picture, plus some explanation, which is even clearer. In addition, the different properties of acids, salts, and hydroxides are explained by using the structure of atoms.</p>
<p>In Chapter 15, "Chlorination and Reduction", in order to make readers thoroughly understand the difference between reducing agents and oxidizing agents, many chemical reaction formulas are cited to illustrate this point. This spirit of not being afraid of trouble and thinking for the readers is the biggest feature of this book.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also many invaluable materials in "The Organization of Atoms", "Molecular Structure", "The Periodic System of Elements" and "Types of Equilibrium".</p>
<p>In short, if you are interested in chemistry, then you must read this book.</p>
<p>The above are all the advantages of this book, but unfortunately, Principles of Chemistry also has a small shortcoming, that is, the language used in the translation still contains some classical Chinese. Although classical Chinese sentences are relatively short, it is best to use vernacular Chinese for scientific translations. This is also a small criticism of Principles of Chemistry.</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly introduce the history of Yi You Academy, because Principles of Chemistry is a member of the Yi You Academy series. Yi You Academy was established in the early 34th year of the Republic of China. It was organized by a group of famous scientists, because at that time they were unwilling to submit to the enemy and were unwilling to waste their precious time in vain. So they compiled and translated many famous Western scientific textbooks in order to lay the foundation for the revival of education in the future. Now the first collection is probably already complete. This collection has a total of more than ten volumes in three types: physics, chemistry, and mathematics. If you need to know more or more details, you can refer to Mr. Yuan Liang's "A Record of Cold-Weather Translation" published in the Dagong Daily on the 4th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Reading "The Lily of the Valley" <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Feiqiong</p>
<p>Authored by Balzac, translated by Gao Mingkai, published by Haiyan Bookstore</p>
<p>You asked me to write a book review for "The Lily of the Valley," and you also stipulated that "the form and content of a book review should be harmonious, just like creative writing." I can't do that. When I read a good book, I can't help but want to introduce it to others, but I often can't write anything. Although I think a lot, I write very little. Although I am fascinated by the author's wisdom, I can only repay it with a large, empty praise, such as "delicate," "profound," "beautifully worded," etc. Even at this moment, I dare not say that I am writing a book review; I just want to tell you softly, "I want to accuse Mrs. de Mortsauf!" Perhaps people will accept my accusation because I still deeply believe that the female gender can connect hearts and shorten the distance between people, don't you think?</p>
<p>From childhood, Balzac rarely received affection from others. His father and mother were always cold and stern towards him. Moreover, in appearance, he was not pleasing. His height and breadth, his lavish and repulsive clothes, and his rude and vulgar behavior at banquets were all unappealing. He was lonely, but he was unwilling to be alone. He held a lifelong desire—"to be loved."</p>
<p>The desire "to be loved" dominated his life. He needed a comforter, a guardian angel, a mother, a lover.</p>
<p>Thus, he found his ideal in Mrs. Berny.</p>
<p>Mrs. Berny was the first woman to truly recognize his genius, the first person to truly cultivate and encourage him. But when Balzac reached the pinnacle of the literary world, she was already a decrepit old woman. On her deathbed, she gave him a touching short letter: "I can die now. I can be sure that the crown I hoped you would wear is already on your head!" Balzac responded to the angel who had guarded him for fourteen years, "She was a solitary flower that the world did not notice. She was once my guiding star."</p>
<p>This solitary flower is "The Lily of the Valley."</p>
<p>When Mrs. de Mortsauf was withered and confined to her valley mansion, managing her children and her mentally ill husband, she suddenly received an unexpected ray of light, which was her reception of a child, a seventeen-year-old boy who gravitated towards her out of a need for maternal love. At the same time, for similar reasons, she accepted the outstretched hand.</p>
<p>"Only a woman's final love can satisfy a man's initial love." The depth of this kind of love is unfathomable. "This woman will never think of herself, only of you. She will not argue with you. She will not ask about her own interests. She will perceive dangers for you that you yourself do not see, yet she will forget her own dangers. Finally, if she suffers, she will not complain. She will not flatter you in the slightest, but she will have a respectful attitude towards what you love in her." (Balzac's words)</p>
<p>An understanding of the world and a mature state of mind made Mrs. de Mortsauf's love increasingly "divine." The love of young women is selfish. They only love themselves (even their own fantasies). They want you to dedicate your entire life to them. They want to possess you, follow you, as if you were their own shadow. However, the love of a middle-aged woman is unconditional. They only ask for a moment of your time, a word, a glance, a tone, a seemingly minor act of attention. They do not want to possess you physically; they only wish to slumber deep within your soul.</p>
<p>"To be loved and understood is the greatest happiness." Unfortunately, this happiness is not lasting. When youth grows wings, it flies away, tempted by another kind of caress. Thus, this solitary lily begins to wither in "excessive affection."</p>
<p>A woman who is accustomed to suppressing emotions must find it easier to overcome pain than to serve virtue. She can hold her head high in great suffering, but she cannot allow love to bow before law and virtue. Mrs. de Mortsauf was the same. She was a mother and the legal wife of Count de Mortsauf. For moral reasons, she had an obligation to remain chaste. She had to swallow her own pain and be a "good wife and mother." However, "thoughts cannot be controlled," and the thirst for love burned her body and mind. When she was dying, she regretted it: "One should live in truth, not in deception. My whole life has been a deception. In these past few days, I have counted the number of these deceptions. I, who have never truly lived, I, who have never gone to the wilderness to find someone, can I die like this?"</p>
<p>"Can I die like this?" Alas, this wild lily in the valley, her life's fate was restricted by the "heavy chains" placed on women by gold rings.</p>
<p>Growing quietly, silently budding in the valley, spending her abundant youth in loneliness, she had a brilliant summer. However, because she still longed for the desolation of the valley in the past, she dared not wantonly accept passionate caresses in the sunlight. She preferred to be a twinkling rooftop star in the evening. No one knew her, no one fully understood the greatness of this woman's life, and no one dared to traverse the entire realm of her soul.</p>
<p>Before all those who "bury orchids and irrigate roses," I want to accuse on behalf of Mrs. de Mortsauf.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Great Emptiness <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Mr. _____'s continuous long novel "Mr. Mosuyou After Taking an Airplane" published in a literary magazine is an autobiography of his life during the Anti-Japanese War. Because his articles have always been known for their obscurity, and recently they are full of Buddhist overtones, they are naturally not favored by the general youth of today. Therefore, I am afraid that not many people will read this text. In fact, the style of this novel is very different from the previous ones. Difficult-to-understand artistic conceptions and sentences like "Date," "Bridge," and "The Biography of Mr. Mosuyou" are rarely seen. On the one hand, it may be a change in the author's own style, and on the other hand, it is also because the life the author describes is all about teaching elementary or middle school days, and there is no way to be profound.</p>
<p>What attracts our attention most here is his view on Chinese literature and writing attitudes and techniques. The author has always belonged to the "expressing aspirations" camp, advocating self-expression and not falling into the empty shouts of formalism. This article seems to continue this attitude. For example:</p>
<p>"...Whether it is Shakespeare in England or Yu Zishan in China, the poet himself is like spring or autumn, so the world is the subject matter, like all kinds of flowers and trees, they bloom when they meet spring, the so-called myriad purples and reds are always spring, or one leaf falls and the world knows autumn. When I read Shakespeare and Yu Zishan, I only recognize one poet, who expresses himself everywhere. However, Shakespeare expresses himself through stories and characters, and Chinese poets express themselves through diction and allusions. One expresses himself in life, and the other expresses himself in artistic conception..."</p>
<p>If you hold this attitude to measure works, naturally there will be many mistakes. For example, Han Yu's articles are chanted three times in ancient prose, but the author criticizes his "Sending Dong Shaonan to Travel in Hebei Preface" as empty, without emotion, without meaning, that is, without any material. Wang Anshi's "Reading the Biography of Lord Mengchang" is also like this. Moreover, aren't the scholars raised by ancient princes just crowing chickens and stealing dogs? Why say such nonsensical words as "The reason why crowing chickens and stealing dogs come out of his door is that scholars do not come?" Originally, this is the old tune of the school of expressing aspirations, but if you think about the past discussions of Chinese literati, they are probably like this, sitting at home and talking nonsense about world affairs, right or wrong is completely irrelevant. Or they specialize in saying nonsense, such as gift prefaces or epitaphs, which are not only flattering, but also simply scribbling on paper. It's just that this Qiu Ju's "Sending Dong Shaonan Preface" is not very appropriate. The emptiness and emptiness of Han's articles are definitely not this one. If you talk about the popular gift prefaces, I think articles such as "Sending Gao Xian, a Buddhist Monk Preface" are much more empty than this one. Since the Anshi Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty, the towns in Hebei have superficially surrendered to the central government, but in fact they are independent, and it can be said that An Lushan's system has always existed. Therefore, Han satirizes Dong Jun because he cannot forget those who are there, and "depressedly suitable for this land," that is, the meaning of "Zhi Hu Zhi Yue," which is quite implicit, how can it be said that it is meaningless? (In recent years, Chen Yinque discussed the political situation in the middle and late Tang Dynasty, and also cited this as evidence.) As for Han's "flattering tomb articles," which have been criticized since ancient times, that is really a representative of emptiness. What should be paid attention to here is that, whether it is empty or true, the big problem of Chinese literati is that they try their best to demand "greatness in writing," not only are they unwilling to do small topics, but even if they are small, they have to "make a big fuss about a small thing" to be considered the essence of writing. The so-called greatness is nothing more than the society, rulers, and kings, forcibly pulling and dragging. Put your own hat on someone else's head, for example, things that violate human relationships, such as "Wu Zixu is not a loyal minister, and filial son is not a filial son," and formulaic words such as "One mountain is watched, and its tightness is greater than the rise and fall of the country," are enough to make people headache or nauseous. It seems that one must fill one's mind with these problems all day long, as for food, drink, men and women, sleeping and getting married, which are inseparable from human beings every day, but no one talks about them, even if they read them, they will definitely be scolded by others, such as Li Liweng and Jin Shengtan. Of course, we don't have to advocate that everyone write Yuan Zhonglang's essays, but there is no need to recite the original Tao every day, which is very obvious. The popularity of this tradition has not been cut off until now. If we look at today's students' essays, eighty or ninety percent of them are "Time passes so quickly, spring has come to the world again," "How can China be strong like this," etc. This is a continuation of the "Between heaven and earth," which Wu Shichang scolded in his observations last year, but the reason why it cannot be improved is still due to what is heard and seen, all are rushing to the west, or are full of certain tones. So that young people lose the courage and motivation to express themselves. They have never thought about how to say what they want to say, but no matter what the topic is, there is already a formula waiting in front, no matter how similar they are, even if they do it year after year and day after day, they are all the same. Fei Ming called this the spirit of Bagu in his article. He once gave the students the title "Maple Tree," and all his life he wrote "There are two trees in front of my window, one is a maple tree, and the other is also a maple tree." At first glance, I thought this student was extraordinary, but later I saw another student, whose beginning was the same, and so on until the third and fourth, all were the same, and then I suddenly realized that they had learned from Fa Xunqiu Night; "There are two trees in my backyard, one is a date tree, and the other is also a date tree." He was immediately so angry that his face turned red, and he scolded the students: "Why don't you say your own words, but copy other people's?" This is probably the experience that any Chinese teacher in secondary schools has had. In fact, it is good to be able to imitate this kind of sentence making, most of them still can't do it. All they know is a set of empty and empty traditions, no matter what topic you give, they will put it on, every head seems to have no shadow of life experience - even if it is very simple - what they say on paper is completely different from what they really want to say. Suppose the new literature continues like this, even if there are one or two famous writers and dozens of famous works, what's the use?</p>
<p>Great emptiness, no truth can fill it!</p>

<p>After an unknown amount of lip service, the US Senate finally passed the amount needed for the first year of the European aid plan, totaling $5.3 billion. However, the total amount of alcohol taxes (including central and local taxes) collected by the US government in 1947 alone exceeded $4 billion. In other words, the average American family paid $115 in alcohol taxes last year.</p>
<p>In the 159-year history of the United States, a total of 27 special congressional sessions have been convened, averaging one every six years.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Miscellaneous Discussions of Right and Wrong <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>A person must have a belief that there must be truth in the world. It is easy to fill the sea, but to bury the truth is a difficult thing that can never be found in history. No matter what "This is right and wrong, that is also right and wrong," "Right and wrong are relative," "There is no right and no wrong" this set of mysterious "philosophy," it can never deny the existence of right and wrong.</p>
<p>Anyone who does anything should do it for the sake of seeking truth. What is right is right, and what is wrong is wrong. There is absolutely no reason for being both right and wrong. Confucius said that it is okay to die in the evening after hearing the Tao in the morning, which means that after understanding right and wrong, even if you sacrifice for the sake of seeking truth, there is nothing to fear. This kind of clear observation and speech, even if there are thousands of years apart, its value remains unchanged because the meaning it contains is precisely the truth. On the contrary, things or words that generally intend to confuse right and wrong and invert black and white, even if they are heard for a while, will soon disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>It is not enough to understand right and wrong, you should go to the right and save the right, dare to fight with "wrong," so that the light of "right" is not obscured by the cloudy fog, passively removing the bad is equal to actively building the good, "Destruction is construction." Mr. Sun Yat-sen said this. Because if the old is not removed, the new cannot be built, and if the "wrong" is not removed, the "right" will also be obscured by it. For example, if a person has the bad habit of wasting money, if he does not remove this bad habit, he will only try to let him earn more money, but even if he earns a lot of money, there is no limit to waste, this person will never be able to accumulate a small amount of money, only by correcting the bad habit of waste can we talk about increasing production.</p>
<p>I think that the reason why this world is so indifferent is perhaps because of the lack of enthusiasm for loving what is right and hating what is wrong. People should have something to love and something to hate. If there is no hate, there is no use for love. The more a great person has the spirit of loving people, the more he hates the few who do evil. Chinese people unfortunately have been poisoned by "Right and wrong are only for opening their mouths," and they lack the courage to be right and wrong, so especially in China, right and wrong are almost difficult to identify, and therefore some people doubt the existence of right and wrong.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no so-called superman among human beings, so it is impossible for one person's words and deeds to be all right, and another person's words and deeds to be all wrong, but this does not mean that there is no right and wrong in the world. The existence of right and wrong is for things, not for people. Often what is right for you is wrong for me, and what is right for me is wrong for you. If people can not think that they are all truth, treat each other frankly, and complement each other's shortcomings, the truth will not be difficult to be clear. If you avoid medical treatment and are afraid of people criticizing your mistakes, it violates the truth, and you are willing to do evil without hesitation.</p>

<p>— Wei Zhi</p>
<p>Liang Rengong was active in the Chinese literary world for a full 30 years, greatly influencing later generations. Mr. Zheng Zhenduo has repeatedly praised him in "Collected Essays on Chinese Literature." As a prose writer, he swept away the so-called lifeless and lifeless prose at that time; as a politician, after the political change of 1898, he also created a trend, leading a large group of people to follow the same path; as a journalist, he was a very successful commentator and writer, and his academic achievements were not in having profound research, but in popularizing his knowledge and showing it to the public.</p>
<p>Rengong's knowledge was undoubtedly greatly influenced by Kang Youwei (Nanhai) at first. Although since the Xinhai Revolution, the paths of the two have been quite different, in the beginning, Rengong benefited a lot from Nanhai, and Nanhai was no different from his mentor. In Rengong's "Autobiography at Thirty," there is a passage mentioning the situation when he first visited Nanhai, which is very moving, and from this, we can also imagine Nanhai's influence on Rengong, which is extremely profound and great.</p>
<p>Rengong's original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"...Therefore, I followed Tongfu (Chen Qianqiu) to observe the etiquette of a disciple and served Mr. Nanhai. At that time, I was young and had a successful career, and I was quite knowledgeable about the phonology and etymology that were valued by the current trends, and I was often complacent and happy. Mr. then made a lion's roar with the sound of the ocean tide, taking the useless old learning that he had held for hundreds of years, and refuting and refuting it, completely overthrowing and clearing it. I entered to see him at Chen Shi and retired at Xu Shi. Cold water was poured on my back, and I was hit on the head. Once I lost all my old fortresses, I was at a loss and didn't know what to do. I was both surprised and happy, both complaining and regretting, both suspicious and fearful. I lay on the same bed with Tongfu and couldn't sleep all night. The next day I visited again and asked for learning guidelines. Mr. then taught me the Lu-Wang school of mind and also the outlines of history and Western studies. From then on, I resolutely gave up the old learning, withdrew from the Xuehai Hall, and asked Nanhai for advice every other day. I knew that I had learned from this moment."</p>
<p>This passage is written very vividly and sincerely, with overflowing emotions, and it is also a typical chapter of Rengong's memoirs.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Enormous Capacity of a Drunkard <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>I say that drunkards have different spleens and stomachs. Those who are good at drinking enjoy it endlessly, and those who cannot drink will turn red in the face and pant even if they only drink a drop. I drink wine like medicine. Whenever I have social gatherings with friends, I am often ashamed. Therefore, when I see someone who is good at drinking, I am always envious in my heart.</p>
<p>Before the war, there was a new shop next to the Great World, which was promoted by a beer-drinking competition. At that time, there was a person who drank twenty-four bottles without getting drunk, but his stomach was so full that he could not drink anymore. Although it was beer, the amount was also visible. I heard my late father say that a certain person in the county (the name has been forgotten) was good at drinking. He always ate and drank wine and sweat (the most violent in Wenzhou wine, boiling yellow wine in a pot to take its steam, the steam is like sweat, so it is named). It doesn't matter how much he drinks, he doesn't care. If he is invited to drink by a friend, he must first cook half a bowl of alcohol and drink it hot, and then go. Generally, yellow wine is used in banquets. Even if yellow wine is drunk frequently throughout the banquet, he can't get drunk. The size of his alcohol capacity can be known. I once met Zhu Jiuxian in Ningbo. Zhu can usually drink seven or eight catties. If he plays guessing games, he can drink more than ten catties. Zhu is good at hand-to-hand combat, so he is rampant in Ningbo and is known as invincible. Anyone who can drink in Yongshang knows it. However, compared to those who could drink in ancient times, it is still far from enough. Ruan Wushan's Tea Yu Kehua records: "Among the drinkers in Jiangzuo, Gu Xiajun (Sil) is the first. He lives in Xiuye Garden and forms a community. There are three wine vessels in his house. The larger one can hold thirty catties. They kill each other in turn. All those who enter the community must first finish three vessels before taking their seats. Therefore, the door is signed: 'Wine guests pass the door, invite them in and give them three elegant drinks. See each other in the morning and decide the winner. Those who are not, do not associate with each other.' The drinkers were frightened and left when they saw it. Occasionally there were those who mustered up the courage, but after three elegant drinks, they could do nothing. When he was in the capital, he gathered drinkers at the same time and competed in groups, and he was also invincible. At that time, Fang Jinwen (Qin), Zhuang Shutian (Kai), Miao Xiangzhi (Yuan), and Li Ningxian (Zhiyuan) were all enemies of thousands of people." If this is the case, then the words in the Biography of Chunyu Kun, a jester, are not entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>Except for a living person, there is nothing more amazing than books, because the knowledge we get from books may be obtained from people thousands of miles away or people who have been dead for many years, and a thin piece of paper can talk to us, excite us, educate us, comfort us, and talk to us as frankly as a brother. -- Kingsley</p>
<p>The books that can help us the most are those that can make us think the most. A book written by a great thinker is full of truth and beauty. - Sivatu Parker</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>What is the name of Wan Cunhe? The angry hair hangs alone, and the meaning turns flat. It is better than the lake and mountains, which are not my home. The road is not dry, carrying the spring to travel. Leaving home, the moon rises, worrying about danger and heaviness. In the wild, the wind rises, and the beans and wheat are clear. Corrupt and shallow thoughts are always for the world. It is not because of being awake or drunk that the eyes are especially bright.</p>
<p>The waist and shoulders are strong and thin, and the ink is thick and fat. I once forgot about food and clothing because of the changes in the world. Saying goodbye to the weeping willows, which are five feet in circumference. I can't bear to sigh that life is not the same for ten years! The lamp is bright and the village wine knows the cold and warmth. The stone is wrinkled and the Wan Mountain distinguishes the details. It is strange that the original essence cannot be hidden. The car leaps forward, and the trees can fly.</p>
<p>Staying in Yuqian</p>
<p>The feeling of loss in the streets and buildings, carrying the wind hat, the night is dusty. Rui frost lightly beats the West Bodhi Temple, and the yellow moon is as quiet as a drunken person.</p>
<p>Out of Yuling Pass</p>
<p>I allow myself to store sorrows, full of burdens and deep, and the hot air of sweat comes out of the pine forest. How does the sentry tower plan to reduce the king's tax? The slanting sun is red and connected to the burden.</p>
<p>The setting sun flies sand on the roadside, and the crows settle down, how busy the trees are! Ask who's heart is more chaotic than the spring mountains? Silently layer by layer, but blindly blue.</p>

<p>— Old Man Half-Dream</p>
<p>Poems of the Tang, lyrics of the Song, and melodies of the Yuan are era-defining literary products. When it comes to literature and art, they are not inherently divided by eras. So why are eras delineated? It is because during those times, numerous talented individuals emerged, delving deeply into these fields. Everyone placed great importance on these areas, and their works became popular for a time, widely circulated, and became major authoritative works that continue to be recited even after thousands of years. Moreover, even though these are just brief passages of words, they can not only express the worldview of that time but also subtly reveal the state of society and the current situation of the country. Often, what history cannot record, they can record with "songs of lament" and "melodic chants" in a roundabout way. Bai Xiangshan's "Song of Everlasting Regret" from the Tang Dynasty is one example.</p>
<p>However, after the Yuan Dynasty, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were no more so-called representative literary works, because their literature and art came from the three dynasties of Tang, Song, and Yuan. Although there were many poets, most of the highest achievements could be traced back to the High Tang, such as Li Kongtong and He Dafu of the Ming Dynasty, and Wang Yuyang and Wu Meicun of the Qing Dynasty. There were very few lyricists that could be mentioned, and even fewer musical compositions. For example, Gao Ming's *Pipa* and Tang Xianzu's *Peony Pavilion* can be considered outstanding works of their time. During the late Qing Dynasty, there were many talented composers, and besides You Hui'an's *Lisao*, Hong Biancun's *The Palace of Eternal Life* was the most famous. At that time, there was a saying: "Pity one melody of *The Palace of Eternal Life*, ruining one's career until old age."</p>
<p>After the reform, although several musical scores were published, such as *Cang Sang Yan*, there were still not many who continued to compose. In my humble opinion, there are a few Sanqu (a type of Chinese song) that are worth reciting. During the Republic of China's sixteenth year (1927), when Yang Yunshi was popular, he wrote "Such a Distant Land", subtitled "A journey ten years later, a farewell ten years ago." Now I will write his lyrics below:</p>
<p>(Lonely Ancient Road in the Setting Sun) A bag of books is packed and carried on a pole. I remember the year he saw me off at the long pavilion, and we held hands to disperse the loneliness on the Wanli Bridge. Bitter farewell, thousands of golden willow branches in the cold, a gust of west wind blows fallen leaves against the battle robe. Saying goodbye, the cartwheels shake, the horsewhips crack, and at that moment, the soul is shocked into the clouds. (One) Wildflowers along the way are like faces, distant mountains are like eyebrows, you can't help but shed tears. In between, countless thoughts churn in the gut, endless drafts of sadness. Turning around suddenly, the journey is ten miles away, unable to see the figure waving goodbye by the willows, only seeing the cold stream and small solitary city. (Two) Crossing the river bridge, staying overnight in a desolate village, last night it was the voices of people in a high building and the laughter of red lanterns, tonight it is a wild inn, mountain passes, stars and moon high. Not knowing the hardships of saddles and horses, only the sorrow of separation stabs the heart like scissors, alas! This taste of sorrow cannot be dispelled. Bring a pot of turbid wine, and slowly drench the intestines. (Three) Asking the hundred-foot Yuntai pavilion, how many of you still have youthful faces? Regretting back then throwing down the pen to join the army, full of heroic spirit, saying that military service and books will bring good achievements, never seeing a young woman in her boudoir whose husband has been ennobled, only seeing the bones of war high on the banks of the Wuding River. Now, the iron halberd sinks in the sand and the achievements are gone, only winning the abandonment of a fragrant quilt and an aging person, moreover, the deep jade bones are buried under flowers and grass, already a secluded tomb, the soul returns at dusk, how can this long-lasting hatred be endured! (Four) Originally surrounded by brocade, flowers, seclusion, pearls and emeralds, I abandoned the tender land and comfortable nest, and exchanged it for this broken land, the backs of horses and the bows of boats. Saying what is the quiet poetic sentiment of the dawn wind and the waning moon, it is nothing more than ancient ramparts, cold clouds, and withered vegetation. Asking how much is an inch of good time worth? For whom is it wasted, not worth half a cent! Regretting the initial ambition and heroic spirit, mistakenly entered the Handan Temple, this betraying others and oneself, this life and death separation is endless, who knows of the tears on the pillow soaking the silk handkerchief! (Five) All year round, it's a difficult time. Managing things alone, no one to see me off on the journey, feeling lonely and desolate, no one to talk to, for a long time not hearing words of concern about food and clothing, who asks if I am cold, warm, hungry, or full. In the past, my spirit was as good as Zhang Xu under the willow breeze, but now I have wasted myself and become as thin as Pan An. (Six) What is most unbearable is the wind and frost all the way, the water villages and mountain shops close early, the quilt still has lingering fragrance, helplessly slightly drunk and idly sleeping, haphazardly falling asleep in clothes, sighing long and short, gritting my teeth and enduring this remaining night. The heartbroken man has never slept soundly night after night, only opening his eyes to dawn every day. Alas! It's reached the thousands of mountains, the setting sun, and the rooster's crowing. (Seven)</p>
<p>His tone of "deep and unending affection" is enough to make those who appreciate it feel their spirits soar. There is also Chen Diexian from Hangzhou, nicknamed "Natural Student," who, when he encountered the war with Japan, fled from Hangzhou to Yunnan and wrote a *Meng Jiangnan* melody. I will also write down his lyrics:</p>
<p>(New Water Order) Flying over the mountains of Sichuan, I come to be a hermit in the south, fleeing the three caves of Qin, baggage all discarded, what is the reason, crossing the world still walking in circles. (Lazy Ditty) Recalling the building by the West Lake, the wind curtain is rolled up every day, the two peaks of the distant hills always contain shyness, the hidden smiles are behind the screen, the mirrored silk reflects the light of the waves, like jade. (Mountain Slope Sheep) Only being happily drunk with wine on the Six Bridges, drunkenly seeking seclusion in the Three Temples, gently rowing in the middle of the lake, loving the moonlight of the tranquil lake as if it were always a painting, spring returns to autumn, the planet Jupiter cycles three to five times, planting willows in front of the door, greening the window of the building. All are old houses, Qingzhao's dressing room, leisurely, all day long with poems and wine, tender, everywhere are flowers and willows. (Wild Goose Falling and Winning Song) Who would have thought last autumn, that the flames of war would suddenly fade, the air raid sirens would roar like cattle, suddenly the spirit chariot flies, ah, how many phoenixes and luan couples are there in this chaotic separation, all becoming laboring swallows flying away. Unexpectedly, Heaven protects us, our family, scattered everywhere, gather in the south behind the screen, retire, preparing for a boat on the Five Lakes, lingering, treating Hangzhou as Bianzhou. (Lucky Order) The whole family bravely dies for the country, the whole house is without sorrow, instead the lake village has an additional air-raid shelter, reviewing the pavilion and lying down together on the mound. (Selling Wine and Praising Peace) Who is worried about the sky falling? Who is worried about the sky falling? In a hurry, urging people to leave, changing the stars and shifting the grains, planning for oneself. Seeing that it is quiet, the fleeting clouds quickly emerge from the cave, the flowing water is divided in confusion, the dog from Huainan ascends to heaven, the monkeys from Huaguoshan are sent away, I, ah, like someone borrowing, leaving alone, ah, fearing that the puppet strings will not last long. (Spoke of Sichuan) Seeing through the barrier of life and death, the dissected Buddha can be endured. Let them go, why not I stubbornly defend, moreover, the peach blossom spring tomb has already been built. (Mandarin Duck Ending) Who knows that after the water runs out and the mountains are exhausted, a thunderous chariot unexpectedly waits at the door, as if waking from a dream, entering meditation, reincarnation, just counting on the remaining years, enjoying the late scenery, acting naturally. In the past six months, turning back to my hometown, fortune and misfortune come from seeking, let the magnificent building become a barren mound, I had already said that the four elements are empty and nothing remains.</p>
<p>The works of both of them contain a kind of true emotion, excellent tone, and beautiful structure, and they can indeed follow in the footsteps of the Yuan people. It is a pity that not much has been passed down, and they have not yet been able to satisfy the appreciation of those who came later. I remember thirty years ago, I once proofread and printed a collection of musical scores for the owner of Songfen Hall, which was a collection from Qian Mutang's library, and there was a new tune of Shuangtiao Water Order: "For twenty years, I have seen through the barrier of life and death, I have been removed from the register of the Black Court, the ghost gods call the Dragon to return to the Lu Sea, riding the tiger down the green mountain, jumping out of the mortal world, from now on there will be no more loyalty." There was also a Resident Horse Listening tune that said: "Thousand-year-old face, jade liquid, yellow bud, nine-turn elixir, half a lifetime of illusion, wind lamp, flint, ten thousand-fold beach, the door of right and wrong is as wide as the sea, the battlefield of fame and gain is as dangerous as a mountain range, from now on, don't interfere, often deep at midnight, facing the Dipper stars, shifting incense burner." It is truly singing into the clouds, and can be called the most perfect tune. I hope that composers will study it in depth, create more excellent musical scores, and not let the Yuan people monopolize the glory of unprecedented achievement.</p>

<p>— Chen Shengyan</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Chance Encounter Marriage (101)</p>
<p>Although Qiwan was not happy in her heart, she hid it for a while and did not say it. Because since she had arrived in Shanghai, she had to go to see her mother, so she invited Daoyun to go with her. Daoyun, however, declined, saying that he was busy with things and needed to arrange everything before he could go and pay his respects to his mother-in-law. Qiwan saw that what he said was beyond reason, and she wanted to refute him and pull him along. Later, she thought that it would be better for her to go and pay her respects to her mother first and explain the situation, so as to avoid the matter coming suddenly and startling the old woman. So, while Daoyun was out, she hired a car and rushed to Mingde Lane. Her mother, Gu Liuru, was overjoyed to see Qiwan suddenly come to Shanghai, as if a bright moon had fallen from the sky into her arms. She held Qiwan and asked about everything, saying, "Seeing the newspaper reports about your suicide by poison, I was very worried. I wrote you two letters, but there was no reply. I wrote to your brother, but there was no reply either. Later, a friend told me that these were all rumors. I also thought that if there was really bad news, there would definitely be a letter from home. Today you came, and I am really happy beyond words." Qiwan heard this and knew that the news of her suicide by poison had already spread to Shanghai. The news had traveled really fast. So she briefly recounted the past events. Liuru was shocked to hear that Qiwan and Daoyun had married and asked, "How did you marry Daoyun? I know this person." Qiwan said, "He also said that he knew my mother. I thought he had considerable property, and he was gentle and amiable, and all his temperaments were very compatible." Liuru shook her head and said, "This person looks good on the outside, and all his social interactions are also very good, but his temperament is unreliable. As for saying that he has considerable property, I have never heard of it. You have handled this matter too rashly." Qiwan was stunned when she heard this. Liuru said, "Although I say this, things have already come to this point, so you don't have to regret it. He says that he has property in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which cannot be concealed. As long as we investigate, we will know. Moreover, you can try to gauge him in various ways." Qiwan said, "As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he had me stay at the Middle East Hotel, which made me suspicious. He has a home in Shanghai, why doesn't he go home directly? Even if he has to stay at a hotel, he should stay at a decent, big hotel. Just this point alone makes me very unhappy." Liuru said, "You can invite him to come tomorrow. He said that he is looking for actors and producers, etc. As long as I talk to him, I will know his true character. You don't need to be anxious. Fortunately, you have already come to Shanghai. I am here, and I have my own ways." Saying this, she comforted her again, kept Qiwan for dinner, and then told her to go back.</p>
