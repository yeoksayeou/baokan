<h3 id="c28">道德教育的示範　——祝全國天主教教育會議—— <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>全國天主教教育會議已於昨日在滬市隆重開幕，由　廷駐華公使黎培理，樞機總主教田耕莘和南京敎區總主敎于斌主持，到全國一百三十個敎區代表數百人，實爲我國歷史上天主敎敎育空前未有的盛會。該會會期預定一週，同時並舉行全國各公敎學校成績展覽會，以供各代表討論如何改進各敎區敎育之參考。代表七個國籍的敎育專家，對於天主敎敎育問題及其計劃，均將發表其珍貴的意見，預料道次會議對於籌設天主敎敎育的總機構以促進各敎區的充分合作，必有重要的決議。當舉世深感道德敎育缺乏之今日，而尤其在共匪到處散播反宗敎反道德的種子的今日，代表世界道德權威的宗敎團體，在本市開會，就其敎育工作的理論與實際，作一自我檢討，對於如何挽回現代敎育在道德方面的低落趨勢，自有重大貢獻。我們對於此番舉行的全國天主敎敎育會會議，雖不願過分誇大其辭，謂卽此就能將中國敎育引向上坡路去，但其意義的重大是不可忽視的；至少此番會議對於中國敎育的改進，應該是一個有益的參考。</p>
<p>天主敎自明末以來，卽傳至中國，對於中國社會文化所發生的影響，相當深遠。天主敎敎會由篤信敎義的人士所組織，並生活於人類社會之中，自與現實的社會不能不發生關係。凡是人事的遷移與變化，社會的盛衰與興亡，天主敎旣生存其間，自然不雖不有其接觸：且有許多社會問題，欲求解決之道，也不能脫離倫理，而人類社會的倫理道德，又在在與宗敎有關。何况天主敎自傳入中國以後，對於促進我國敎育的普及，曾作極大之努力、故天主敎對於我國社會所發生的影響，非可漠視。卽以全國天主敎敎友人數達四五百萬人之一點而言，已佔全人口萬分之一，當非尋常社會團體可比。僅以敎育一項而論，天主敎特別重視敎友之敎育，凡是敎友之子女，不論在都市或在鄉村，均須入學校讀經文，卽在窮鄉僻壤，也有天主敎創辦的學校。天主敎不僅車視基本敎育，而且也十分致力於中等教育及高等敎育。徐家匯的徐匯中學及徐滙女中，已有八十一年的歷史，恐怕是滬市最早的一個學校。在我國政府提倡新式的學校敎育之前，天主敎早已在全國各地創辦中小學校了。據最近的統計，全國男子中學共有五十二所，女子中學共有三十六所，男子高級小學共有二百九十七所，女子高級小學共有一百八十三所，男子初級小學共有二千六百十七所，女子初級小學共有一千零二十所；此外，簡易小學也有一萬一千五百二十三所。由此可知全國天主敎敎育的如何發達，及其對於我國社會文化的影響如何重大了。</p>
<p>我們檢討一下全國天主敎學校的內容，卽可知天主敎敎會學校，莫不重視做人的道理；在它們的學校裏，任何功課無不啟發學生的良知，一切活動也沒有不顧及學生的道德修養。所以天主敎敎育的宗當，，一言以蔽之，乃在將學校敎育與肚會敎育打成一片；質言之，要使社會　設得更爲美滿，要使人類的生活更有意義。誠如于斌主敎所謂「我們宗敎敎育家之任務，不僅栽培完人，提倡道德，且亦期使每個人皆成爲基督之化身。」這種敎育的方針，正足以補敎目前我國敎育的不足。在此舉世深感人格敎育和道德敎育缺乏的時候，天主敎敎育重視人格陶冶和道德修養尤其値得倡導。所以我們期望此番會議，在檢討天主敎敎育的理論與實際之時，應該把提住道德敎育的基準，努力挽救我國目前敎育在道德方面的低落！</p>
<p>我們再看全國天主敎學校的散佈，其重點偏在華北。僅以北平一市血論，城區就有十二所公敎中學，一所補仁大學。但是華北遭共匪的擾亂，幾乎沒有一片乾凈士，而共匪則無惡不作，在其佔領區又恣意摧殘宗敎事業，所以天主敎徒受共匪的荼毒，亦最爲慘烈。田樞機總主敎自平來滬，前天向中央社記者談稱：「北平現有自共匪佔領各地逃出之天主敎徒二三千人以上，其中不少曾爲共匪捕押。目前華共共區傳敎工作，雖已極爲困難，但敎會方面，從未考慮撤退之計劃。蓋以天主敎在世界各國遭受全部或局部苦難之磨鍊，已有一千餘年；艱苦之歷史，使吾人益堅定與惡勢力奮鬥之信念。」參加此番會議的代表，不少來自華北的，其中必有遭受共匪茶毒及壓迫的，我們願以至誠至向彼輩致敬，並對其不屆不撓的精神，表示十二萬分的欽佩。同時，更希望出席此番會議的各敎區代表，成能本此精神，與惡勢力奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>共匪弄兵作亂，一方面欲　武力擴充地盤，企剛達到奪取政權的目的，另一方面則利用思想鬥爭爲工具，從而破壞人與人相處的倫理觀念。所以從國家民族的觀點而論，共匪是國家的罪人，民族的公敵；從宗敎道德的角度去看，共匪更是全人類的公敵。此次會議，除內求敎會本身的團結及工作的聯系而外，尤應注意民族精神的發揚，止義觀念的確立。在積極方面，以敎育爲示範，達到國民道德的重振；在捎極方面，則應實行精神動員，參加思想戡亂，粉碎共匪所有破壞倫理毀滅道德的任何毒計，使中華民國次一代的國民，絕不陷入共匪所製造的混亂痛苦之深淵。</p>
<p>最後，我們還得研究一下天主敎的敎義。它決不是一種出世的宗敎，而應該是一種積極的入世主義。天主敎不僅有謹嚴的敎規，精密的糾織，而且還有一種大無畏的戰鬥的人生觀。一般敎士固能安貧樂道，在窮鄉僻壞本主以終的，在中國不一而足。其在一般信衆，也能時時防衛，刻刻戰鬥，以仁愛爲出發點，以助人爲快樂，以中正和平爲基準，爲窮苦人民謀福利。這　幾就是所謂「天主敎精神」。此次會議所討論的範圍，雖然限於敎育，但是我們認爲最重要的，當無過於發揮基督敎誨萬民之道，爲道德敎育的示範。</p>
<h3 id="c29">人口局長暢談　戶口普查籌備概況　後年決如期舉辦 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕內政部定於三十九年舉行中國歷史上首次之全國戶口普查，人口局長包惠僧今就此一創舉之意義與籌備概况，詳吿記者。包氏首指出戶口普查爲基本國勢調查之一種，以補戶口淸查，戶籍登記等時期不劃一，簿册不精確之弊，至選定卅九年舉行之理由，係求與國際統計協會及聯合國人口委員會請於西歷末尾零字之年舉辦世界人口普查之建議相符協，（按民卅九年爲西歷一九五〇年），俾學術上實用上均更有價値。</p>
<p>包氏並稱：普查所需人員約八十五萬人，內部已訓練完成之各級戶政工作人員逾三十萬人，現仍繼續訓練中，期於兩年內，即普查前，人手不感缺乏。</p>
<p>普查所需經費雖鉅，惟徵諸日本，印度往例，其總額在國家全郃歲出中所佔百分比仍小，且籌備，調查，統計，三種經費並不於同一年內支出，故籌措費用尙不過難。</p>
<p>關於普查　式之規定，包氏認爲應力求簡單，僅就最基本事項加以調查，內政部擬定之表內所列調查事項，僅有姓名，稱謂，性別，年齡，本籍，婚娶狀况，敎育程度，在本縣市局居住是否滿六個月等項，邊疆省區則增列種族，語言，宗敎等項，渠指出此僅爲擬議，仍將隨時採納國內專家意見，以爲增刪。</p>
<p>未來首次普查資料之整理，包氏意見以採用機器法爲原則，惟亦可能採用條紙（即卡片）法，俟明年衡度客觀情勢再爲決定，蓋以目前之工資物價匯率計算，機器整理較條紙法需費尙省也。</p>
<p>人口局對如期舉辦普查之決心，亦可於包氏談話中窺知一斑，渠於答覆記者所提，如屆時剿匪軍事及財政狀况之推演不能盡如理想，則是否仍將舉辦普查一問題時，以堅決之語氣稱：人口局亦曾以最惡劣之情况爲根據，考慮實施普查之法，即如所當匪亂未平，財政困難，而全國戶口普查仍能舉行，惟辦法則應改變，即對於匪區戶口，以精密估計代替普查，根據歷年資料與選樣調查，加以推算，又如財政困難，則可於已辦理戶藉登記地區實行糧食或　　，俾將煌定經賞　辦尙無戶籍登記地區之普查，如仍感不敷，逆料差額有限，國庫尙可籌撥。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕艾森豪威爾將軍已於一星期前退任出長哥倫比亞大學校長。其任職陸軍參謀總長時之報吿，業於今日由陸長洛雅爾發表。其中曾警吿美國認爲必須從事準備，以應付原子時代之攻擊。渠認在各國已省定的願意裁軍以前，美國務須準備擊退此項進攻。但渠亦表示希望持久和平得經由聯合國機構而建立。</p>
<p>此一報吿，包括渠於一九四五年十一月十九日繼馬歇爾出長陸軍參謀部起，至最近退職時爲止整個時期內之美軍事政策。艾將軍認爲美國目前之陸軍，不足以擊退原子攻擊，裁軍已達危險程度，不容再事栽减，爲應付原子攻勢起見，美國必須建立各種設備，以保衛美大陸及其週圍基地，並立即施行報復反攻，擊敗敵方主力，重創其根據地，以完成敵我間之和平。現時代的悲劇，乃爲戰爭甫已，主義的衝究又起。我西歐的友邦已處困境之下，若干且受軍事化政黨的威脅，後者的主要目的在促成紊亂，以遂某一外國主義的目的。此等國家如果放棄其自由的奮鬥，成爲極權主義的犧牲者，則美國的安全亦將在危殆之中。</p>

<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>不屈不撓精神的一個例證</p>
<p>一九四〇年夏季，當英國在海上的因境益趨尖銳的時候，我們不得作新的決定了。</p>
<p>八月四日，在我前往白硫磺泉的前一天，英大使洛齊安來看我，並且表明他政府「迫切的願望」，希望從我們那裏購買若千艘較舊式的驅逐艦。他說英國需要它們來度過在他認爲是它「目前的緊急關頭」。</p>
<p>在我出席哈伐那會議期間總統曾就此一題目以及英國可能以它在西半球的若干根據地讓與或租借給我們的問題，一直在和洛齊安談話並和邱吉爾首相通電報。出售或租借驅逐艦的意見，是由法總理雷諾於五月十四日——僅在德軍侵人法國之後四日—首先們議，而於次日由邱吉爾先生加以附和。</p>
<p>當時，總統是反對這個建議的。</p>
<p>但是一切的東西是比較的。當法國的崩潰使我們的危險大見增加之後，我們更傾向於同意出讓我們的過齡驅逐艦，假如因出讓而造成對我國國防的捐失可以從共他方面獲得補償，例如獲得新根據地這種情形之下，那就尤其好了。海軍早就希望沿大西洋獲得更多的根據地。我們還覺得旣然我們的驅逐艦可以增强英國海軍的實力，事實上等於爲我們自己增加一層保障，因爲英國艦隊是站在亡命的軸心國和我們之間的。再者，國會於一九四〇年大月廿八日通過了政府所提的一個法案，即國防法案，其中准許出售海軍配備，祗要海軍作戰部主任確認對於國防並不需要就可以了。</p>
<p>當洛齊安於八月四日到我辦公室來的時候，我能够充份理解英國的危險猶如他能够描述的。他說單在上一個星期中英國就失却五艘驅逐艦。他指出驅逐艦對於應付潛艇活動以及敵人在英吉利海峽中的其他活動，極爲軍要，因爲在英吉利海映中，大軍艦是不能充份發揮其效能的。</p>
<p>他說，當我在哈伐那的時候，他已經和總統討論過這個問題，現在希望把當前的情形放在我的面前，以冀在未來數星期中能够有所成就。他還說英國將願意讓我們使用接近中南美洲和在百慕大的若干英國島嶼上的海空根據地設備以及紐芬蘭的航空根據地。</p>
<p>我首先向洛齊安說明這種便利，當然對於美洲所有的共和國都有裨益的。我說，「遵照在哈伐那會議和以前其他會議中所獲致的諒解，美國如採取任何行動，須與其他美洲共和國合作。」</p>
<p>同日，我送給總統一個有關出售軍艦和輔助艦艇的備志錄，其中包括一個建議的法案草案，以備提交國會，使它時別認可這種出售，在和總統討論這個法案草案的時候，我們共同認爲向國會提出這個法案可能有二點不可取之處：其一是它將引起孤立主義派相當厲害的反對；另一是在可能獲得通過之前或需幾星期的討論。</p>
<p>這是我離開華盛頓時的情形當我在白琉璜泉休息三星期的時間中，我有一個私人電話綫　在我的公寓　並且每天從議務院接到大量的郵件，因此對於當時由總統和韋爾斯在辦理的驅逐艦—根據地談判，我一直在密切注意並且隨時參與。八月二十三日，在我回到華盛頓幾小時之徒，我就到白宮去出席內閣會織。</p>
<p>就在那裏，總統對我說，「我們和英國關於根據地和驅逐艦的談判，己經　巡不前。請你看有什麼辦法。」</p>
<p>當我和總統討論根據地的問題時，我發覺他個人對於這根據地的幾乎全部都有驚人的知識。他在這些海港或者曾經巡遊過，或者曾經游泳過，或者曾經　過釣。他知道它們有多少深，多少闊，能够容納多少船隻。</p>
<p>他也知道火部份島嶼上民衆的貧困情形，因此他不願意負起治理這些民衆的責任，所以，在我離開華盛頓的期間，他己經改變了原來直截爽快將根據地加以購買的主張，而想租借九十九年。我原先是贊成直截爽快讓與我們的，但是現在願意同意租借的辦法。</p>
<p>於是我就着手辦理談判，決心使其儘速完成。</p>
<p>翌日，當我正在查閱談判的經過情形時，白宮通知我說英國大使於明日（星期日）晚上和總統有一個約會，羅斯福先生希望我出席。</p>
<p>洛齊安在星期日下午相當早的時光來看我，因此我們可以在他那天晚上和總統談話之前，先就一般情形檢討一過。他對於八月十九日韋爾斯以代理國務鄕資格交給他的建議，提出若干反對。他說他的政府不喜歡美國建議中規定我們有絕對的權力可以確定和選擇我們所需要的根據地，而英國方面則無任何發言的機會。他的政府反對建議中以驅逐艦交換根據地的辦法，而希望出諸禮物交換的形式。</p>
<p>後面一點所以成爲困難，乃是因邱吉爾先生在八月二十日的一篇演說中曾經明白講以證物的形式直截地出借根據地。他根本沒有提起驅逐艦。首相覺得互換禮物比斤斤較量的交換更能在大西洋兩岸造成一種合作的感覺。他並且說英國大衆對禮物不會像對交換那樣細細計較，而認爲英國出借有價値的根據地以交換五十艘舊驅逐艦並不値得的。</p>
<p>但是我們這方面也有困難。總檢察長傑克遜相信總統以我國武裝部隊總司令的資格，在法律上是有權以驅逐艦出售給英國的。但是假如總統並不經由國會特別授權而這樣做，他應該可以靠一種辦法來滿足國會，就是在交出驅逐艦之後，我們就可以獲得根據地方面的種種便利，而其價値，則較諸保留這五十艘驅逐艦顯然能給予我們更大的安全。</p>
<p>更重要的一點，就是總統並無權力可以把政府的財產以禮物的形式贈與別國。我就這樣吿訴洛齊安。</p>
<p>那天晚上，我在白宮遇見洛齊安。當我們坐着等持和總統的約會時，我重新向他申述總統沒有機力放秦政府的財產。</p>
<p>但是當總統接見我們的時候，使我很驚奇的一點乃是洛齊安似乎漢視我所說總統在法律上不能以公家財產作為禮物的說話，仍舊提出了英國的建議。</p>
<p>在洛齊安把他的論據講完之後，我就第三次向大使而是第一次向總統說，總統並無任何權力以公家財產當禮物，贈與任何政府或個人。羅斯福先生當即和我表示同意。</p>
<p>於是總統就把這樁事情交給我，讓我和洛齊安來擬定一個解決辦法。</p>
<p>下一天的早晨，我請國務院的法律顧問海克荷斯和司法部的湯恩遜特法官到我的辦公室來，設法覓致一個兩全辦法。稍經討論之後，海克荷斯突然建議在邱吉爾研希望的互換禮物以及我國總統如不獲得交換的來西不能放棄驅逐艦的法律立塲之間，終究可以有一個妥協的辦法。</p>
<p>旣然英國人並沒有確切說明究竟想把什麼根據地出借給我們，那麼爲什麼不把它們分成兩類？第一類將包括紐芬蘭和百慕大的根據地。這些英國可以用直截爽快的贈與形式，出借給我們。第二類將包括加勒比安海周圍的根據地。由於它們接近巴拿馬運河，在軍略上對於我們更有價値。這些可以借給我們以交換五十艘驅逐艦</p>
<p>我立即發覺這就是我要尋找的公式。</p>
<p>於是我們就着手重行起草建議？</p>
<p>那天下午，海克荷斯和湯恩遜特去見總統，他對於這種妥協辦法表示同意。</p>
<p>在擬定的草稿中，開頭是英國政府的一個保證，就是說，假如英國軍艦不能接近英倫三島的領海時，「英國艦隊決不投降或鑿沉，而將送往帝國的其他港口繼續保衛帝國。」</p>
<p>邱吉爾在六月四日向議會發表的演說中，就曾提供過這種保證，但是爲了以驅逐艦移交給英國的原故，我希望正式重覆一遍。</p>
<p>八月二十七日，洛齊安送給我邱吉爾致總統的一個很長的電報。邱吉爾以「前海軍人員」署名親筆簽字，贊成先前由洛齊安提出的建議，就是以直截爽快的贈與形式出借英國根據地，這對我們是不能接受的。</p>
<p>邱吉爾並準備保證英國艦隊決不鑿沉或投降，但主張由洛齊安和我交換函件的形式出之。</p>
<p>他用他一向的那種不屈不撓精神，聲首他不希望把交換的函件公佈，因爲「我想德國政府使其艦隊或艦隊殘餘部份投降或鑿沉，可能性要大得多。他們已輕行使過這種辦法，猶如你所知道的。你將記得數月前在我給你的一個私人電報中，曾經說過假如我們這樣做，將是一種卑怯的行動。我們中間每一個人都這樣想。」</p>
<p>邱吉爾反對公佈這種保證，在他於八月十五日致總統的一個電報中已經聲明過，當時他說：「……請你記着，從我們的觀點，或許也是從你的觀點講，任令一種印象滋長，就是說我們認爲英倫三島及其根據地的衹征服並不是一種不可能的意外的，是何等有害。我們人民的精神奇佳。」</p>
<p>洛齊安把總統想到的根據地的所在地用電報打到倫敦去之後，邱吉爾當即表示同意，並且還無代價地加上加勒比安海中的安蒂可可島，他說這個島可能用作飛艇根據。</p>
<p>在八月二十七日那天熟烈的晚上，洛齊安，克魯克斯部長，史泰克海軍上將都在十時三十分左右到我的公寓來，發覺我穿着寬大的衫袴。我們四個人閱讀草案達一小時以上。洛齊安起先提出幾點修正建議，但是後來似乎頗表滿意，並且說他將以內容送呈政府。</p>
<p>八月二十九日夜七時，洛齊安到我的公寓來，留給我他的政府所提的反建議。我們在原文上略作修改，繼即打電話給洛齊安，他在十時三十分再到我的公寓來。他同意我們所作的修改。</p>
<p>翌日，八月三十日，我把修改的地方用電話通知當時在海德公園的總統，當即獲得他的核准。</p>
<p>洛齊安在波士頓度了週末，於星期一下午（九月二日）返抵華盛頓，而於當晚七時到我的公寓來。我們就在那裏簽署並且交換了照會，肯定了驅逐艦——根據地這筆交易。</p>
<p>洛齊安並且交給我他對於我先前給他的一個備忘錄的答覆，那是要求他保證英國艦隊的處置辦法的。</p>
<p>洛齊安在答覆中說：「英王陛下的大使受首相之命通知赫爾國務鄕先生，就是說這個聲明的確是代表英王陛下政府的旣定政策的。但是邱吉爾先生必須指出這種假設性的意外之事，對於德國艦隊或其殘餘部份發生的可能性，比對英國艦隊爲多。」</p>
<p>最後一句話是邱吉爾百己加上去的。</p>
<p>至此，在我們歷史中最重要的一次談判，在一星期內宣吿結束。</p>

<p>謝濬南昌人，曾任少將副師長及參謀長，現任中華土產公司董事長，生活奢侈，交遊廣闊，與滬上著名聞人威有往來。憲兵人員先據密報，中華土產公司採辦之麻，有資匪嫌疑，而着手偵查，注意謝濬之行動，發覺其往來人等中，甚多空軍，且多不明身份之昆明來客。此輩昆明旅客，住於東方飯店，東安旅館，揚子飯店等處，行動詭秘，生活浪漫，每日與昆明方面常有可疑之電報及信件往來。而此等電報及信件之收發處，大多爲昆明楊致和，乃通知昆明憲兵方面對楊致和注意偵查。</p>
<p>根據線索　追查毒品</p>
<p>本年元旦，昆明憲兵根據上海供給之綫索，於楊致和之寓處，發覺一空軍人員即（武子開）携出吉普車輪胎一隻，甚爲可疑，並偵悉該輸胎由飛機運滬，即電上海憲兵獨立第三營派員於機塲守候。是日來者有楊錫林等數人，楊有情婦在滬，抵滬後，急欲探望其情婦，將毒品交予在江灣機塲服務之兪慶慈，楊迅（在逃）等，轉交在滬之聯絡人張海　。惟楊迅等向張海珊要索額外運費兩億元，張未肯照付，未受毒品。楊迅等遂直接與負責銷售之謝松年聯繫，由謝松年借用某聞人之汽車，駛往領毒處，開出空頭支票八千萬元交予楊迅，將毒品運至海防路三二七號。以上各情均經憲兵人員一一偵悉。</p>
<p>解京人犯名單</p>
<p>一月九日下午三時，滬憲兵人員分爲八組出動，分赴海防路三二七號及東方飯店等處，開始逮捕人犯之工作，在三小時內，除一部份在逃外，共捕獲宇犯及嫌疑犯五十九人。其中卅五名嫌疑犯已交保，廿四名宇犯已解京審訊，其名單如下：謝濬，謝松年，謝陳秀英（謝濬之妻），劉戎波（某大學講師），石明（德國柏林大學藥物學博士），蕭世銑（中學敎員），周椿蔚（文具商），張文杰（中和黨中央執行委員並爲民社黨之雲南省黨部執行委員），謝愼行（鹽商），金寳光（百貨商）李蔭南，夏禹，曾慶俊，楊明達，（以上退伍軍人），馬繼吾，張同榜，兪啓鳳，兪虔慈，楊錫林，魯朝英，陳富寳，程可孟，黃禹楊，（以上有若干人爲現役軍人），張海珊，（羣益書店經理）。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕南市邑廟東首之福佑路觀音閣街一帶房屋，均係沿街東洋式單幢市房，陳舊不堪，居民大都爲苦力。第七十三號二樓二房東方夏友香，四十四歲，甯波人，偕婿胡阿四（卅五歲浙江人，業美貨生意，）胡妻小毛（廿五歲），胡子鴻寶，胡女翠珍（九歲）等數人同居二層統樓；二層閣樓分租於袁全法，袁業飯司務，一家五口，妻袁杏月，女袁桂珍（三歲），幼女阿翠，甫生數月，及寄養之嬰孩，　一歲；三層閣樓另租於一般單身漢俗稱借舖場者，計有十餘人之多，每月每人取房金三萬元，此輩多爲碼頭小工之</p>

<p>開會後由文運會主委潘公展致詞，略謂：戲劇係溶和一切眞善美之綜合藝術，共本身所負使命至爲重大，過去戲劇界篤守本位，努力硏究，各方面供已表現極好成績。惟戲劇不能以單純逼眞動人，或反映人生爲滿足，而應以做到凈化人生及美化人生爲最高目標。尤共上海五方雜處，各種戲劇均在此薈于卒表演，所予市民敎育上之直接影響頗大，故希望戲劇工作者不僅要充分發揮過去對戲劇對人生之認眞忠實堅毅等諸種精神，更須保持團結，接觸觀摩，研究改進，使戲劇克盡其功能，亦使戲劇能跟隨時代發揚光大。潘氏末並對前年平劇界義演捐助文運中正文化獎金基金事，重申感謝之意。</p>
<p>劇壇元老呼　　贏得全場掌聲</p>
<p>嗣由熊佛西代表話劇界致詞，渠稱戲劇負有敎育使命，但我國以大量金錢辦敎育，而未聞以餘力培植戲劇工作者。渠認爲每人終其一生不能離開「學」字，堪供學習之場所，除學校外，即爲大的社會，惟認識社會最淸楚最親切者厥爲戲館。戲劇演出有喜怒，亦有哀樂，但此種喜怒哀樂中實含有無限人生眞諦。渠主張惟有「寓教育於戲劇」始爲今後戲劇界及敎育界之理想出路，故呼籲戲劇工作者充實自己，研求技巧，含辛茹苦，共謀中國戲劇復興。熊氏獻身話劇運動已埀數十年，老而强健，爲今日劇界元老之一，昨渠在其繞腮長髯中，向全體戲劇界吐露懇擊希望，熱情奔放，贏得全塲一片掌聲。</p>
<p>繼復由周信芳致詞謂：戲劇具有永久性，而演員生命有限，爲下一代着想，戲劇界應以捧角之興趣，轉爲改革戲劇與充實戲劇。渠稱，近年來電影事業發達，所予平劇影響甚大，本市各平劇院最近改爲電影院者頗多，平劇人員因此俱紛紛改往台灣及菲列賓等地獻藝謀生。長此以往，平劇界從業員失業問題，可能漸趨嚴重，故渠呼籲平劇工作人員應多採用近代意識及設備，努力改良，期趕上時代，不致淪爲整個戲劇中之犧牲者。</p>

<h3 id="c89">大庸血案　前因後果　民槍殺害了縣長　黃頴川血染城郊 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>〔本報長沙八日航訊〕湖南大庸新任縣長黃穎川，於元月二十八日赴任，被人們拒絕，擊斃於城郊。消息傳出，各方震驚。記者於是案發生後，迭訪有關各方，探詢前因後果，茲彙誌於次：</p>
<p>從遠一點說起</p>
<p>大庸是湘西的一角，山輙小邑，地方閉塞，民性强悍。近年來，這里地方勢力爭執極烈。黃穎川的被殺，就是「地方勢力」衝突下的犧牲者，下面記者要寫出這裏地方勢力衝突的經過，爲了行文之便，假定爲甲乙兩派的鬥爭。</p>
<p>省府於去年五月更換縣長，新任田廷鈺，是王主席的保定同學，由省幹訓團總敎官調任。他是大庸人，是一位很超然的人物，本是很適當的人選，但是時適値共匪王定烈，李人林竄擾湘西，大庸的鄉鎭長本是氏選的，現在因匪竄近，自然成了綏靖區了，鄕鎭長和民槍領袖都要由縣府委派，田未到任，舊任進省，縣府由舊任的主任秘書代行，就在此眞空期間，乙派人士，乘機要挾縣府委派一批鄉鎭長，等到田到任後，提出要挾，要新任承認舊任的委派是合法的。田不肯承認，乙派認爲縣長有袒護甲派之嫌，於是調動民槍，逼近縣城示成，縣府隨宣佈戒嚴，警察隊出動巡邏，不幸就在五月七日巡邏警察在南門外觀音橋被民槍襲擊，演出了　動湖南的所謂「五七事件」。是時王主席適巡視湘西，駕次慈利，聞報於八日趕到大庸，熊悟工跑掉了，王主席將到任甫五天的田縣長撤了職，調九區保安副司令李善後繼任，辦理善後。</p>
<p>倒李運動展開</p>
<p>李善後縣長也是保定生，年紀在五十開外，此人本也和田差不多，算是超然人物。下過大庸自從「五七事件」後，這筆賬都寫在乙派身上，乙派的領袖熊悟工議長出亡後又一直未返縣，李縣長對乙派的行爲自然有點看不慣，有意無意的和甲派人士接近。所以在乙派心目中，李是甲派的縣長，日日思有以倒之。</p>
<p>這是甲派全盛時期。乙派自此深受了一連串的刺激，大家都惴惴不安，於是掀起倒李運動。無疑的，乙派境倒李，甲派當然要擁李。最後，倒李派獲勝，省府發表黃穎川繼任大庸縣長。</p>
<p>黃是保靖人，中央軍校八期畢業，現年三十七歲，做過湖南保安大隊長，現任保靖甲　議員。省府命令一發表，大庸省派人士，不啻晴天霹需，對他們像宣判死刑似的嚴市。加以楚人多謠，通路紛紛，傳說黃接事後　對甲派予以嚴厲打學。大庸人的蠻性前面說過的，乙派旣演「五七事件」，甲派未見得不能演另一個</p>
<p>黃接任命後，就風聞縣　空氣不利，任命本在立委選參以前發表，但他為避免競選　會起見，遲遲不動身，等到立委選舉過了，才起程赴任，不幸行平半途，　遭殺害，亦云慘矣。</p>
<p>黃麒書信一通</p>
<p>黃穎川胞弟黃麒，六日由湘西來省，上書王主席，述乃兄慘死經過，係得之於隨黃縣長履新之衛士口中，至爲詳盡，大意云：黃縣長係於元月十七日由省垣啓程，道經保靖，永順赴任，二十七日宿大庸之厚坪，二十八日下午三時至縣城西門外樟樹下地方（距城約五里）休息，突有舊友二人來迎，並吿以現時城內已戒嚴，遍街滿貼反黃擁　標語，城廂四週密佈槍兵，決以武力抗拒台端入城，且勸萬勿進城，免遭不測等語。黃答以此次受命來庸，首要急務，厥為消除地方糾紛，自身純粹站在政府超然立塲，對任何一方，毫無恩怨可言，毋庸過於顧慮，當囑衛十彭某隨行，而另一衛士向某暫留原地，並將本身自衛手槍交與向某，又囑彭某留下手槍並交向某，即偕同隨行人員程勉之及彭某入城，詎料甫至城門，行未數步，即有人舉槍向其頭部放射，旁一士兵亦以長槍射擊，立即斃命，印程兩君，亦同時被害，衛十彭某事先未遵吩咐，仍　槍於大衣內，以防意外，彼時即欲出槍救護，復被徒手二人扭抱，槍亦被奪，惟掙扎脫身，飛奔出城，雖經城門上下兵眾亂槍射擊，幸免於難。（見於「呈王主席書」中）</p>
<p>儼然大戰狀態</p>
<p>案發後，電訊即吿中斷，該縣經多日紛擾，自六日起電訊始吿聯絡，據息：縣城在「擁李拒黃」派手中，城外爲「倒李擁黃」派控制，雙方均藉民槍爲資本，城郊城內，高壘深壕，儼然大戰狀態，人心惶惶，岌岌不可終日。　七日，該縣參議會，縣然部暨社會人士有電到省，報吿大庸慘案經過，稱：黃縣長來庸赴任之際，曾率人槍數百，蜂湧入城，並聲言要屠殺挽李拒黃之民衆，一時人民僨激，不自約束，以致雙方火拼，黃穎川遂於亂槍中斃命云云。上項報吿，與黃穎川胞弟所述情形頗有出入，因併誌於此。</p>
<p>大庸慘案如何處置，這有點彷彿剃頭的遇到癩痢頭，實在有些難辦。願政府當局先以全力消　地方勢力之爭峙，懲兇却　該置之第二步，否則此案難免陷入事態擴大及地方麋爛的惡化局面。（本報特派員黃潮如）</p>

<p>〔本報香港航訊〕歷史是會重演的，去年滬隊曾以一對〇壓倒港華聯，今年上海隊又以二比一，再勝華聯一仗。今年香港華聯人材鼎盛，滬隊能打勝華聯，確是滬隊的光榮。這是二月十一日的戰事，戰塲還是在快活谷，交戰結果，滬隊在前半時先勝一球，下半塲一比一，華聯無法平反戰局。是戰華聯人選一依預排，滬隊則略有改變。</p>
<p>上海隊</p>
<p>張邦綸</p>
<p>李義臣　吳祺祥</p>
<p>韓尼波　孟義良　高保正</p>
<p>李　　夏體先　勞勃司托夫　韓龍海　費看華</p>

<p>馮坤勝　宋　聖　劉松生</p>
<p>李碩友　黎兆榮　陳德輝　馮景祥　謝錦河</p>
<p>港華聯戰略失敗</p>
<p>假使從陣容去比較，我始終認爲滬隊未有勝過港隊的地方，但港隊究竟是敗了。本來呢，華聯的兩翼，實在是不足派用塲的。這一點，在選人的時候，我們已經指出。豈知黎兆榮也失了常，「傳不準」，「射不勁」，整條鋒綫，僅得一個馮景祥在支撐，要這條鋒綫去攻擊，當然無法得手。</p>
<p>而在戰略上，華聯也犯了最大的錯誤，眼看滬隊的身材高大，還是靠高吊傳中上球，兩翼全不肯於得球後盤進深入，僅靠高傳，於是進攻路綫，全給滬隊截煞。</p>
<p>小黃毛有了生路</p>
<p>滬隊表演最好的是張邦綸，撲出黎兆榮一隻十二碼，救了馮景祥兩記險球，保持滬隊的優勢，便在此君手中。費春華有超水準表演，韓龍海加人了前鋒，勞勃斯托夫便有了生路。華聯敗在戰略運用失當，和戰將失常。</p>
<p>開賽，華聯迫進，　滬門而攻，達十分鐘，然後見滬隊反擊，就在這一次混攻中，候榕生禁區內犯規，十二碼球，「懶牛」李義臣一脚踢高，華聯逃過大難，轉取攻勢，馮景祥一射，碩友頭頂都無法破關。</p>
<p>費春華特別卯上</p>
<p>廿分鐘過後，費春華搶進，斜裏錦洪出截，「小費」起脚，均幹撈着球兒，不防勞勃斯托夫衝前一碰，球滾入網內，港隊先負一球。此後華聯力謀平反戰局，一次李碩友開角球，邦綸迎球一拍，馮景祥伏在後頭迎球一頂，可惜彈柱野逸，華聯在前半時只好先居下風。</p>
<p>易陣，雙方都穩打穩踢。十四分鐘時，滬聯突然急攻，李垚底綫得球，橫向門前急吊，勞勃斯托夫虛衝一下，春華機警，竄前念頂，球飛入網，二比〇。華聯遭此打擊，馮景祥力拼而前，一次急射，一次高吊，都經邦綸隻手回天。廿分鐘，祺祥被罰十二碼球，兆榮踢得太輕，竟被邦綸拍出。直至卅二分鐘，錦河斜傳景祥，景祥於死角內將球勾入網內，二比一。華聯終無法轉移戰局，再以一球飲恨。</p>

<h3 id="c124">法國財政上一大措施　法郎貶值的經過 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐巴黎記者　沂若</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>「法郞要跌價了」，巴黎一般市民這樣地揣想，有兩個多月了。政府先是闢謠，旋而緘默無言，終乃派大員去英倫及華盛頓，磋商「要公」。就在這時候，巴黎的交易所活躍起來了，各種股票都被埀靑，尤其是外國股票；在本月十八日這天，成交了十三萬張股票，爲去年一年所未見者。各政黨呢，都把「防堵貶値」高揭出來，自負爲國幣的保護者，組閣　人並定爲國策，安定人心。昨晚，財政部長邁葉特地招待巴黎各報及外國驗法通訊員，在他的辦公室裏，聲明了法郞貶値：英鎊自本月二十六日起兌換八百六十四法郞，美金兌換二百十四法郞，這是官定價値；市價還可以伸漲。巴黎市民從此恍悟，去年十一月七日巴黎晚報所刋的消息無誤，政府闢了謠又自招，但是誰還理這段不淸的是非？各自依舊活下去。國民大會在二十六日下午，聽到內閣總理自稱，「在去年九月，任財長的時候，使開始準備了」！大家都一楞。</p>
<p>這次貶値，是戰後第三次，爲時僅三年半，若是比起法郞的前身，杜爾鎊Livre　tournois，通行了八九十年（一七一〇年至一八〇二年），穩固得比鐵還硬，眞是望塵莫及，就是比起上次歐戰以前的金法郞，行使了一百十一年（自一八〇三年三月二十八日至一九一四年八月一日），質未變，量也未减，不能不嘆及世風不古，江河日下了。這是什麽原因呢？戰後第一次的貶値，適當法國恢復舊土，軍事尚未結束，於一九四四年秋，權將法郞暫定爲「五〇比一一與美元做價，「二百比一」與英鎊做似，及軍事結束，國外通商急待整　，乃依照實値，於一九四五年十二月底，做第二次的貶値，改以一百二十法郎折一美金，以四百八十法郞折一英鎊；但是手術不大澈底，商務未能暢通，美國的貸賑物易也來得不痛快，所以才有這第三次的貶値。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>這次貶値煞費了當局的苦心：對內一再掩飾，對外百般折術。去年十一月七日巴黎晚報謂法郞將貶值，次日財政部長殊曼謂：「該報侵及國家財政的尊　」，訴之法庭，以後便無擊無嗅了。今年一月十三日，當法國議會內部鬧得選　議長正激烈的時候，外部經濟次長阿樂方忽去倫敦，傳說商酌十六國經濟會議再度召集事宜，次日即告完畢；緊接着，法國經濟兼財政部長邁葉跟踵而去，談了三天無結果，於十八日返巴黎。這時候，理財專家「茫代斯俯郞士」從巴黎飛到華盛頓，與國際金融局宇持人商談，這才挑明了法郞「外匯新値」：一美元折合二百五十法郞，國內仍維持一百二十法郞的原價，得到該局的首肯。那曉得，第二天（十九日）法國政府改了主意，爽性國內外一律改成新値，誰不滿意，再去市價上爭短長，該局也無所謂，反正可以方便馬歇爾計劃的實現；英國人聽了，大不以爲然，立加反對，這是二十　一日的事，所以功虧一簧的茫代斯俯郎士本想凱旋而歸，在二十二日獲得命令，暫緩。英外部的經濟次長柏茲Sir　Edmund　Huh　Patch同行遄行來法，告訴法國政府「這可使不得！」邁葉聽了，目瞪口呆。柏氏緊接着一句：「如取消成議，英國每日加四倍供給法國煤斤」（二萬五千噸！）</p>
<p>法國政府看到自家　幣値，不能自己跌，就商於盟邦英美，却見仁見智，彼此又似非一　鼻孔出氣，內閣總理殊曼即於二十二日晚間，召集邁葉，皮杜爾，阿樂方，及法蘭西銀行行長某尼克，商討對付英國方針，連夜召集閣議，決定不　英國意見；但是美方的國際金融局仍議而不決，那位法國的理財專家欲行復止，原來該局也持反對意見，認爲法方獨自貶値，將影鄉國際金融的前途。</p>
<p>最後。階段到了，英財長克萊波斯Sir　Stafford　Cripps突然飛到巴黎，與殊曼及邁葉面談之後，次早（廿四日）九點半，英法兩方財政專家在法外部集議，十一時半各專家參與兩方經濟次長及英大使的會議，十二時半法內閣會議，下午二時半皮杜爾與英大使會談；克萊波斯於下午四時四十分離巴黎，六時半到了英倫，拒絕任何談話。有人說，夜半可以宣布英法談判經過，及國際金融局對於法國政策的意見，午夜到了，內閣代言人謂須俟二十五日晚七時，才能在巴黎及華盛頓同時發表，一夜又白過了。二十五日早十時，法方與國際金融局還不斷地在礎商；英國的經濟次長看看無話可設了，乃率同英國國庫局的一位二等秘書，於下午二時半飛返英倫，好讓邁葉安安靜靜地於下午七時，對着新聞記者們，發表金融　　　　。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>原來法郞　貶値，並不十分單純，也不專對美元英鎊而發。第一，它的新値，在國內國外雖劃一，仍然翠上了「官價」的帽子；此外從二十九日起，得在交易所內，依供求律（實即金融的公開投機）獲得市價，自由升降，所以法郞仍未脫離「兩重」價格；無怪乎邁葉說，「目前仍是一個暫局。」第二，它的新値，除對英鎊美元自跌了百分之八十的身價外，對其他各國幣値，也是同樣地自卑，如加拿大元，瑞士佛郞，印度的盧比等等，隨着美元上升，就連港幣，都規定合五十四法郞；只對我國的法幣，不打照面罷了。　就是在法國領土之內，法郞價値並不一致，法國本土是一個價錢，已如上述；北非領地，南非領地，海洋洲及中美領地，印度屬地，以及法國管制下的安南，各有各的幣制，有的呌法郞，有的呌盧比，有的呌越幣，兌律不一。有的隨着本國的法郞跌，如Algerie，Tunisie，Moroc，Gupane，Antilles等地；有的另定新値以維持原値，如舊以三十六法郞換一印展法盧比者，現需六十四法郞八十生丁始可；或另定新値，更貶了當地的幣價，如海洋洲諸地：新Caledonie，新Hebrides等處，本以當地的二法郞四十生丁換法國本土的一個舊法郞，現需以四個當地法郞三十二生丁，才可換到法國貶値後的一個新法郞，豈非雙重貶値？就連維特住「原比價」的越幣（合十七法郞）及南非領地，聯合島，聖彼得島，Mipuelon諸幣（合一法郞七十生丁），其實都跌了；無怪乎摩洛哥王曾與法國大總統一書，據說與當地幣値有關；海外議員聞訊後，羣趨內閣總理殊曼面前質詢，認爲這樣的殃及池魚，實近武斷，殊曼無奈，允許從長計議、</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>法令刋　後，內列　然：</p>
<p>國外市塲，基於美元集團與英鎊集團的不同，發生兩種現象。法郞貶値後，國內出口貨値，無形地减低百分之八十，本可暢銷無間。無奈美元集團各團貨物充實，無須法國的出產，况又施行關壘政策，所以是個單相思的痴夢；無人堅決反對，也不熱列贊成，除非是對於巴黎的香水懷着幽思！只有幾個守己奉法的國際金融局的　事　，抱着條文，一口咬定不合法，深慮他國效尤，拆了該局的台。在英鎊集團國裏，法貨傾　指日可待，加巴黎交易　將　開買賣黃　及外鈔（暫　　　及葡幣兩項），虛價的英鎊將　官定的四元三分美金回到二元八毛美金的實價，是無異對英鎊一個威脅，一個致命傷，所以英國部長們都不禪隔峽之勞，到巴黎來阻止法郞的貶値，徒費了幾天辱舌。果然，貶値的那一天，倫敦交易所的各項股票，立刻跌了百分之二十多，便是一個明證；據說英鎊集團諸國，將採閉關政策來對付，所以法貨外銷的前途，並不樂觀。</p>
<p>國內呢，更是紛紜得莫衷一是。先看各政黨：堅絕反對的有最右的共和自由然，有最左的共黨，有戴高樂黨，有農黨，連社會黨都露此意，因爲這是椿不得民望的措施，始自民衆共和黨的殊曼，實現於自由經濟政策的社會急進黨員邁葉。邁氏自去年十一月底兼攬財政經濟兩部後不及兩月，次第實現了：（一）新財政方案，包括新稅則及强性公債，特別捐等項；（二）法郞貶値；（三）黃金外鈔自由買賣；（四）取消五千法郞大鈔，（五）……每項皆經過國民大會激烈的雄辯，有時爭持得不相下，只好以「信任」方式來取決，偶然獲得了平心靜氣的大多數，實爲難能可貴。總工會，天主敎工會，新總工會（自總工會蛻變而成者）無不站在反對地位。一般市民，更是莫知所從。殊曼說，非如此，不足振起法國的經濟！</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>就在這時候，財部於本約二十九日晨二時下令：五千法郞大鈔即日起無效，商家不得再行收受。這靑天霹霹立刻驚動了四千萬法國人，各報咸出牧刋。登時街上遊浪着不少的嚴嵩式乞丐，滿口袋的五千大鈔，買不到一塊麵包；各大旅舍的貴賓想向櫃房挪借一兩千元，老板答以「房飯暫賒，零用怒不通融」！市塲上登時發現了七折的黑市，每鈔只合三千五百法郞，北非阿爾吉林爾同日的行市只合到三千二百法郞。全國銀行同時依令閉門兩日，停止兌換，一俟國民大會表決辦法後，再啓門交易。按市面流通大鈔計共三千三百萬萬法郞，占全體通貨三分之一强。</p>
<p>國民大會立刻討論大鈔撤銷問題，爭辯通脊，直至今晨四時半，僅以三〇七對二八六票通過了政府提案；兌換手續，另由法令規定之。至於黃金外鈔自由買賣問題，尚待今明日的國民大會取決，這是財政問題中的主要一項。</p>
<p>從法郞貶値至撤回大鈔，是法國財政上的新現象，驚動了歐美諸國（一月三十日巴黎）</p>

<h3 id="c125">原子衝擊器 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>原子物理學所以有今日這樣輝煌的成績和猛進，原子衝擊器（Cyclotron）是有很大的功勞的。它的譯名在我國還沒有一致，普通在報紙和雜誌上常譯作「諧旋廻轉器」，「廻旋加速器」，「旋廻益能器」和「原子分裂器」，在高級的科學書報上，有稱爲「磁電加速器」的。爲了通俗和容易了解起見，我們還是採用「原子衝擊器」。它的出現，不僅爲近代物理學的研究開了新紀元，對化學，生物學和醫學都有很大的影饗。牠的發明人就是美國加利福尼亞大學敎授　倫斯博士（Dr．Ernest　O．Lawrence）爲了酬答他的偉大的供獻，一九三九年的諸貝藥物理學獎金就授給了他，而且從此使原子核的研究中心從英國的劍橋士學和德國的　　學院轉移到了美國。這個工具的神秘一直保持了很久，後來才被人宣洩出來。</p>
<p>原理</p>
<p>未介紹牠的整個內容之前，先談一談牠的生成原理。根據波爾（N．Bohr）和惠勒（J．A．Wheeler）兩人的試驗和推論；一切化學元素除了銀以外，均處在所謂「介穩狀態」（Metastable）下，無論由熔合（兩個輕元素的原子核的合而爲一）或分裂（一個重元素的原子核的分裂爲二）過程中，就有驚人的大量儲能解放出來。因之，有個科學家說我們是生存在一個可怕的火藥庫中，並不是言過其實。試想這些微小的原子核一旦分裂爆發，不就是個原子彈嗎？但爲什麼牠們並沒有原子核分裂或熔合的事發生？這還得有足够的賦能（Activation　energy）給原子核才行。譬如二個輕元素的原子核互相要接近就會熔合，但當接近到某種距離時，就受到牠們本身的陽電荷的相互推斥而分離。同樣一個重元素的原子核要受到極猛烈的衝擊後才能分裂，實事上，平常絕不會有這樣强猛的東西去衝擊牠的。必須要人工去想法增加一種射體的賦能後，再去衝到原子核內部去給它一個致命的痛擊後才能分裂。</p>
<p>有了充分的賦能去衝擊一個原子核，情形不簡單，途中要克服許多難關。包圍在原子核周圍的障壁（Barrier）就是一座像牆似的推斥力，當一個瘋子（Proton，帶陽電荷的小質點）帶着充足的能量衝近原子核附近時，首先受這推斥力的反抗，除非它前進到某種近距離時能接受到內聚力的吸引外，它會被推斥到敗退回來的。因之，我們要想法給這個衝鋒陷陣的小質子一高度的速率，讓它一鼓作氣衝到能接受內聚力的距離上去，道賦於質子一極大的初述能址，就是所謂充分的賦能了</p>
<p>另外根據量子論（Quantum—theory））在衝擊原子核時，共振（Resonace）現象是重要而必須的。這裏的共振是指衝擊的射體的能量等於被衝擎的原子核的共振能量。所以質子衝鋒時，太快或太慢都使碰撞的機會减少。唯有在「適當」的速度下幾乎是每衝必裂了。　根據這個原理，最初是用各種放射性物質在衰敗過程所放出的Alpha質點來充作射體去衝擊原子核的，但由於放射性物質的不易得到，使科學家國而想利用帶電質點（如質子）去充這個差使。只要加速强化塲中的質子就可去衝擊。第一個利用這原理的是英國劍橋大學的哥洛夫（Cockroft）和華爾頓（Walton）在一九三二年設計的原子加速器）Atomic　accelerator　or　atom—smasher），裝備簡單，最高的電壓有一百萬伏特，利用普通的容電器，但並不比Alpha點好多少。後來美國麻省理工大學的范爾克拉夫教授（Prof．Robertl．Vande　fraafl）的靜電發電而（Electro　tatic　generator）又竣明出來，他利用一條最簡單的原理：「電荷傳達於一個球體上，立刻傳佈在它的表面上「　增高電壓到三四百萬伏特；而使質子帶上幾　的能量。（一鰐（One　Crocodile）就是一百萬電子伏特，簡寫MeV．這個能量單位的意義是能的傳達於一個曾被加速於一百萬伏特電塲裏而帶有單位電荷的質點之謂，牠等於我們普通用的能量單位微爾格（Micro—erg）的一·六倍）。</p>
<p>構造</p>
<p>利用這個原理，設計最巧妙的還是羅倫斯博士的原子衝擊器，它不像靜電發電器要用很高的電壓。一個帶電質點在一個均勻磁場中運動時，其運動的方向即受磁力綫影響而變直綫運動爲圓弧運動，圓圈的半徑以磁塲强度和質點初速而定，運動愈速，偏轉愈小，圓圈就愈大。根據這個事實，他建造了一個極偉大的眞空圓室，中間置一個黃銅扁箱用絕緣體分成兩個半圓形的眞空室。二眞空室分別與一個具有二萬伏特的端電壓和每秒二千萬循環的交流電機連接，這樣在每一個極短時間內，二半回眞空室內是帶着相反的電荷，且具有二萬伏特電勢差，整個說二半圓室常是十一；一十；十一；……地交互帶電。眞空圓室外有一個偉大强烈的電磁塲，一個連接有十萬伏特端電壓的直流電機的帶電板及一個靶子</p>
<p>當這眞空圓室內引　進了一羣質子後，即立遭A室內正電荷的排斥，B室內負電荷的吸引，因而使這羣質子由　A室進入B室，復有電磁塲的偏轉作用使其質子繞圓弧前進。即至B室，因逢交流電的一循環，B室爲十，A室爲一，又迫使質子繞圓弧進入A室，這樣一次一次加强牠的速度，並且使圓圈的半徑也一次次加大，使質子在眞空室內作螺旋形的繞轉，最後當那轉開的螺旋形軌道的半徑變成和圓室的半徑相等時，質子的射綫就透過小窗而射出。由於帶電板的存在，逼使這高速度的質子羣依一定軌道準確的衝擊到靶子上去。靶子上就置着要被衝擊的元素。假使靶子上放着鈾—235，牠的原子核就會遭衝擊而分裂，這種分裂是繼續的進行下去，所謂連鎖反應（Chain　of　reaction）就是。</p>
<p>他建造出的第一座原子衝擊器，現在看起來是很小的，電磁鐵的兩極直經僅有三十七吋重八五噸，第二座直徑有六十四吋重二百噸，可生質子的射綫能量到二十五鰐。新近羅侖斯博士又完成一座重四千噸的呌「同週期原子衝擊器」（Synchro—cyclotron）），其賦於質子的能量之偉大可想而知。</p>
<p>應用和改進</p>
<p>如前面所談，原子核是原子的心，牠的周圍被電子的包皮所封包，一個衝進了包皮的質子可能迷了方向不能準確的碰撞原子核本身，並且爲了克服障壁，又喪失去一部份能量。因之，一羣質子在速度尚有餘威之際能碰撞到原子核的機會很少，可能幾千個質子中只有一個完成了它的使命。這樣是有一點得不償失，因之，在實用上，用人工加速帶電質點去衝擊原子核而解放出偉大的儲能沒有很大的希望。</p>
<p>爲了補救這個缺點，有兩個方法可以大規模產生原子的分裂，一種是加熱到一種靶子和射體的混合物至一非常高溫度而發生强烈的互撞而促使分裂。一種是用中子代替質子作衝擊的射體。後者已被人採取，利用所謂「中子增殖」（Neutron—multiplication）使其成爲最理想的射體。這些表們先放下不談。</p>
<p>原子衝擊器的重要如前所述，但可惜中國迄今尚沒有這樣一座。根據統計，在一九四一年秋，美國全國分佈在各個著名大學的試騐室中一共就有一百二十多座，英國三座，蘇聯一座，法國一座，加拿大一座，丹麥一座，和日本一座。勝利後，報載日本自己也設計了兩座，但均遭美軍一下令拆毀了。</p>
<p>値得一提的，北平輔仁大學的王普博士在原子核物理上也有優異的供獻，就是和勞伯斯（RB．Roberts），馬養（R．C．Meyer）三人在美國卡內奇硏究院中用原子衝擊器去衝擊鉀靶而發現了最重要的「遲發中子」（Delayed　neytron）現象，這表示出中國科學家只要有工具和環境，定能有許多輝煌的建樹的。此外錢三强夫婦在巴黎的發現，也是値得稱道的。北平研究院擬將鐳學硏究所改爲原子硏究所，並在北平束皇城想建原子大樓，專門研究原子物理學，都是科學界的好消息。我們希望政府多給經費，早日做些成績出來。</p>

<h3 id="c127">藍圖的製法 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 劉遂生</p>
<p>關於建築，統計以及契約上，通常採用藍圖。製造藍圖所用的藥品，手續和原理如何？想爲讀者所亟欲知者。乃依本人在化學實驗室中多年的經驗，詐加敍述於次：</p>
<p>（一）藍岡紙的製備　製備藍圖紙所用的藥品，雖有數種；但通常採用下列兩種藥品：</p>
<p>一，檸檬酸鐵銨；二，赤血鹽。</p>
<p>法將檸檬酸鐵銨一克半，投入十立方米　之溫水中，充分攪拌，使其溶解，算是甲液；次取赤血鹽二克，亦溶於十立方　米之溫水中，充分攪拌，使其盡溶後，算是乙液。更在暗室中或紅燈光下，混和甲乙兩液，多加攪拌，務使其混和均勻。乃取海綿或棉花，　　　　　混合液，塗抹於洋紙上，呈鮮黃色。仍置暗室中，待其陰乾後，妥爲收藏，不可露光，留備後用。</p>
<p>（二）藍圖曬製的手續　先在玻璃板上或透光紙上，用墨筆作岡表或字畫，留備後用。次取下照相框，反置桌上，移去木板與照片，而留玻璃。乃將備有圖表或字畫的玻璃板或透光紙，反置於原玻璃上；復將藍岡紙反置於透光紙上；再覆木板，加鞘壓緊。於是持照相框，移至太陽光中，使陽光直射正面，約經五分鐘至十分鐘，當視陽光的强弱為準。但見黃色的藍圖紙，逐漸變色，終呈灰色帶褐之色。取出藍圖紙，則見原有墨跡遮蓋之處，依然係黃色。投置淸水中，洗漂數分鐘後，即成藍底白色圖案或字畫的藍圖矣。依個人經驗，浸於水中之時間久長，比較淸楚。欲藍色加深，應加食鹽水或鹽酸於淸水中即可。</p>
<p>（三）藍岡修正的方法　透光紙上所作的岡案，如果多畫了點畫，則印出的藍圖上，即多白色的點畫。欲加修正，祗須塗以檸檬酸鐵銨與赤血鹽的混合液，置日光中曬過，再經洗滌即成。設或透光紙上少畫了點畫，則印出的藍圖上，即缺少了點畫，可用鹼液如小蘇打（NaHCO3）水，或洗溜蘇打（Na2CO3．IOH2O）液，又或苛性鈉液，甚至肥皂水充墨水川，加添應加的點畫，則藍色即褪去而呈白色的點斑。</p>
<p>（四）藍圖生成的原理　我們在化學實驗中，通常製出兩種藍色沉澱：一種呌做普魯士藍（Prussian　blue），學名爲亞鐵氧化鐵（Fe4〔Fe（CN）6〕3）；另種呌做滕氏藍（Turnbull＇sblue），學名　　　化　（Fe3〔Fe（CN）6〕2）。前省係用鐵鹽如三氮化鐵（FeCl3）或硫酸鐵（Fe2（SO4）3液，加黃血鹽（又名亞鐵氧化鉀，K4Fe（CN）6）液而生成；後者係用亞鐵鹽如綠　（FeSO4·7H2O）又名硫酸亞鐵液，與赤血鹽（又名鐵氰化鉀，K3Fe（CN）6）液化合而得。然若將鐵鹽與亞鐵鹽互換應用，即無藍色沉澱可得。例如將鐵鹽液與赤血鹽液相混，幷無藍色沉澱發生，藍圓生成的原　，即基於此：蓋因檸檬酸鐵銨係鐵鹽，與赤血鹽液混和，不生變化，塗抹於紙上，不見光時，仍無變化；但露於日光中，則鐵鹽逐漸還原而爲亞鐵鹽，與赤血鹽發生滕氏藍。惟墨跡遮蓋之處，光綫不能透過，因之不生變化，經水冲洗，隨水流去，故仍呈白色。</p>

<p>也許大家讀過「點鐵成金」或「點石成金」的故事，但是現在在報上再看見的時候，已經不是故事而是事實了。</p>
<p>自從原子硏究日新月異以後，已有人設法用人工改造原子，去年有一位科學家把鉛變成黃金。鉛是不値錢的金屬，這樣一來，黃金還有什麼希奇呢？可是請你放心，把一兩鉛變成黃金的代價，比眞金子還要貴　倍呢！</p>
<p>角這種方法變成的黃金，粗看和眞的金子一式一樣，可是鑰成金戒指，戴在手上，雖不覺得燙手，但幾天之後你的皮膚就被灼傷，原來專面還組藏着不少質子要放射出來，把這種金子藏了一年後，它的質子放射完了，就與眞金一般無二。</p>
<p>可惜金子雖名貴，除了作裝飾品和貨幣外，並無多大用途，聰明的科學家何不研究出一些製煤，布，和米的方法，來救濟這世界普遍的災荒呢！</p>

<h3 id="c129">說賭 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>賭博的的風氣在上海一向很　，農曆年的歲尾年首這幾天，更是到處一片賭聲。大人賭，兒童們也賭，家庭變作小型賭塲，街頭巷尾是大衆賭塲。新年的上海，幾乎是　特卡羅化了。</p>
<p>上海地方有這樣的說法，則嫖是全空，賭是對冲，吃是受用，穿是威風。所謂「賭是對冲」的「冲」字，恐怕是對折的折字的別音，意思是說賭祇有一半的機會，比嫖雖然還略勝一籌，但總是含有一半冒險性的。</p>
<p>然而賭博的誘惑力量，恐怕也正就在這一半的冒險性，因爲要是賭準能贏錢，那就應得上俗語所謂的嫖能倒貼，賭能贏錢，是天下第一營生了。唯其賭並不能準贏錢，但有一半勝利的機會，才能使人樂此不疲，不僅樂此不疲，且不惜傾家蕩產　　之。</p>
<p>嗜賭的人一般都是聽敏人，他們雖都明明知道賭是勞民傷財　行動，明明知道這是得不償失的玩意見，但却偏偏會迷信他們能把握所謂「路」。在股票交易所中有所謂劃綫專家，在大賭塲中也有劃綫　　朋友，而且據說他們還有所謂「科學」的根據。然而除了賭塲老闆外，我還沒有聽人說過那一位綫　專家曾因靠賭發了財。反之，我曾看到過有些專門代賭客劃綫路的「蹩脚生」，他們本身就是賭博塲中的犧牲者，是失敗了的過來人。</p>
<p>寫過「賭徒」一書的舊俄作家杜斯妥益夫斯基，他自己就是嗜賭若命的人；在他夫人所寫的「回憶錄」中，曾說杜斯妥益夫斯基自信他對賭博的方法深有把握，特別對於輪盤賭。可是在德國旅行的一個時期中，杜斯妥益夫斯基不僅預支的稿費全部輸光，甚至弄到險乎流落他鄉，然而終其身他對賭仍不失其愛好。</p>
<p>像杜斯妥益夫斯基這樣智慧的人物，竟亦深信賭有把握的方法，足見賭博是具有怎樣的誘惑力量了。</p>
<p>但要是我們能够理解人類所共同具有的冒險性格，就不難理解賭博的神秘吸引力。人實是天生的賭徒，人類好鬥，好戰，好勝的性格，都不外是一個賭徒的性格。它需要刺激，需要發洩，而賭博的道具與方式，正就能供給這種需要。所以與其說賭博具有深刻的吸引力，還不如說是因爲人的性格，尤其是人的社曾生活尚具有弱點所致。</p>
<p>好鬥與好冒險的精神，也許不能說是弱點，因爲許多大事業的成功，往往發於這種精神動力。但如果社會的風氣僅鼓勵好鬥與冒險的精神於徼倖一途，則人的精神在找不到正當發洩之餘，自然祇有趨於一切所謂「公餘雅玩」這套玩童兒了。</p>
<h3 id="c130">維他命太多了怎樣 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 均</p>
<p>我們都知道維他命是維持人體正常的生理變化所不可少的要素。缺少了維他命，正常的生理變化不能維持，就要發生種種病症，例如缺少甲種維他命會發生夜盲症和角化症；缺少乙（一）種維他命會發生脚氣病，神經炎和急性心臟袞弱症；缺少丙種維他命曾發生壞血病；缺少丁種維他命曾發生佝僂病和軟骨病；缺少戊種維他命曾發生不孕症。近年來經科學家的研究，陸續又發現了多種維他命，總共已有三十餘種之多。</p>
<p>市上各式各樣的維他命製品如此風行，足見維他命的重要性已得一般人的認識了。</p>
<p>可是，維他命太多了，是不是有害處呢？</p>
<p>據最近硏究的結果，若人體攝取了過多的維他命，它的生理變化也會失常而引起病病。</p>
<p>目前已知道的，是甲，丁兩種維他命過多時會使中毒。前者中毒的現象是惡心，頭痛，嘔吐，遲鈍，昏睡等，後者會使血中的鈣量增高，結果使肌肉和神經的感應性降低，還會引起腎臟，心肌和血管鈣化的嚴重後果。又據動物試驗的結果，乙（一）種維他命也有毒性，它會使外周血管擴大，血壓降低，並麻痺延腦呼吸中樞，使呼吸困難，甚至停止而死亡，但究對人類的毒性如何，還待繼續硏究。</p>
<p>過猶不及，維他命也非例外。</p>

<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>民國初年，北京有湖北三傑之稱，三傑者，總統黎元洪，戲界大王譚鑫培，陝西巷名妓小阿鳳，三人皆爲　產，故有此稱也</p>
<p>民國前，我家住在武昌曇華林，黎爲協統，其叔王屛先生與我父結爲把兄弟，兩家有往來。民國成立，余家遷居上海，黎爲湖北都督，兼被舉爲副總統，余所譯之淸宮二年記，黎閱而善之，囑宋敦甫寫信與我父，欲羅致我進都督府，任外交部份工作，余以病未去。黎之爲人，雖非雄才，但其不受袁世凱武義親王之封，拒絕段祺瑞解散國會之令，大節不易，在民國史上，自有其地位。</p>
<p>譚鑫培爲武昌小東門外沙湖人，幼年與父逃荒到京，初學武生，改唱鬚生，聲名大起，其唱賣馬一劇，能將英雄失路侘傺無聊之狀，發探盡致，有天生秦叔寳之稱，入內廷爲供奉，有譚貝勒之名。某年湖北水災，余兄請其義演助賑，欣然應允，並將歷年太后所賞之小銀元寳，約數百兩，捐出助振。當光宣之交，譚在中和園唱戲，與之配者，有名靑衣王瑤卿，名丑王長林諸人，戲價每人一千六百文，合之南邊錢只一百六十文。余兄弟友人，常常聽戲，同鄉畫師劉寳臣議我等爲「痰（譚）迷心竅」。一日譚演天雷報，我等强拉劉寳臣往觀，當演至靑風亭最緊張時，賽臣不禁淚下，足見譚戲感人之深。滬人但知失空斬爲譚氏一絕，不知其狀元譜（打侄上墳）尤得藝術之妙，譚每　此劇，必請我等往觀。</p>
<p>小阿風在民初亨有大名，其貌並不甚美。後數年，約在民十前後，我與蔡子玉兄到暘台山看杏花，住在雙峯寺，一日淸晨，兩人坐籐轎到大覺寺，一路杏花成林，如椒如菽，或紅破白露，朝陽照之，光艷絕倫。夭覺寺有玉蘭兩株，高與簷齊，開花最有名，我等去時，花已開到八九分，在院徘徊間，晤傅沅叔白理齋兩人，邀進房吃粥，見王克敏爲宇人，桌上列火腿肉鬆松花等粥菜，又有高庄饅頭兩大盤，內屋又出一女子，股動招待，似曾相識，我等辭出，白理齋送至寺門，余私問女主人爲何人，理齋大笑，言：「大名鼎鼎的小阿鳳都不認識嗎？」有人誤蔡鍔所暱爲小阿鳳，實則設計助蔡出京往滇起義之名妓為小鳳仙。蔡病死海外，北京中央公園開追悼會，小鳳仙趕到靈前痛哭，親掛一飾靜聯云：「不幸周郎竟短命，早知李靖是英雄。」以紅拂自居，極占身分。小阿鳳小風仙兩人，皆爲名妓，而所賞識之人，竟有天淵之婦。</p>

<p>— 君左</p>
<p>這一位新豫劇創作家自民國二十年以後即專力于豫劇改革事業。他生長在常期動盪無邊愁苦的現代的中原，現代的中國，外感强敵的使凌，內感社會的黑暗，所以他在改編的劇本裏，最能迎接時代潮流和大衆呼聲，而對於地方特徵的優點仍能予以發揚光大，這就是他的好處，確實不同凡響。可是樊先生最近一兩年來的表現尚娥不够，雖然他獨力地領導他一手所組成的那個獅吼劇社在西安，可惜直到今天，還沒有看到他有什麽新的傑作。</p>
<p>王景雲就是他的得意弟子之一，這位在蘭州紅極一時的坤伶，芳春不過十八九。宋淑雲最擅演悲劇，以販馬記，琵琶記，唱出人間無數的淚珠，而她的年輪漸長，家庭担負甚重。遺憾的是她們兩人太不和氣了，這種舊式伶工的妒火是不應該再有的。還有一個李蘭菊也相當地紅，彼此都爭着掛頭牌，唱壓軸戲，以前鬧得不成話，改了新光後，雖不是什麽軍事管理，究竟帶一點公家氣息，三個紅女伶間的氣氛不像從前的緊張了。</p>
<p>除她們幾人以外，還有三個很好的角色：一個武生，一個老生和一個丑角。這樣，總算班底整齊。蘭州愛好豫劇的文化工作者正在打算展開這一個豫劇改革運動，約請樊粹庭來蘭州，編導幾個嶄新的劇本，配合戰亂建國的要求。關於豫劇如何改革即新豫劇之創立，不外從劇本，道具，演技，唱白，塲面，音樂，燈光，及演員等下手，譬如說：豫劇從前的樂器相當多，像軟弓胡琴，硬弓胡琴，月琴，三絃，四股絃數種，近年來因伶人嗓音太低，乃减少到無可再少之處，然而豫劇坤伶皇后陳素眞出演，必加至四五把胡琴或其他弦樂，如果更能採秦腔及平劇音樂之長，則不至像今日聽豫劇音樂之單調無味，這就是豫劇必須改革的一個重點。</p>
<p>我記得去年冬天在上海和潘公展先生談文學再革命運動，公展先生幾次强調地方劇之必須改革，使其現代化，大衆化，藝術化。可惜公展先生不能遠來蘭州看看我所介紹的河南戲即豫劇，我想公展先生看了一定是贊許而且會認爲有改革價値的，我想公展先生一定會賞識王景雲的年輕漂亮和宋淑雲的表演深刻。如果有可能的話，蘭州的新光劇團很願意遠征上海，獻技求敎。據我想：觀衆的反應決不會低於看新疆歌舞團吧。（三七，二，九，寄自蘭州）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Four Allied Banks Board of Directors to Reconvene on Thursday; Loan Policy to be Revised; Increase in Agricultural Loans and Higher Interest Rates <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Four Allied Banks Board of Directors, which has been suspended for two months, is scheduled to reconvene on the morning of the 19th of this month. The secretariat of the Four Allied Banks has already issued meeting notices, and unless there are unforeseen circumstances, it should not be postponed. This meeting is being held upon the instruction of Zhang Qun, the vice chairman of the Four Allied Banks Board of Directors, who will preside over the meeting. If Chairman Chiang has returned to Nanjing by the time of the meeting, he may also personally attend and provide important instructions. The main topic of the meeting is to discuss the loan policy for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948], which can be divided into two parts: agricultural loans and general loans (including industrial loans). Regarding this year's loan plan, the head office of the Four Allied Banks previously sought opinions from the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury. It has now received plans from the Farmers Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings Bureau, China Trust Bureau, and Cooperative Treasury. The Central Bank's opinions on loans and this year's loan plan will also be submitted on the 16th. The head office of the Four Allied Banks has also received opinions from relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, which will be compiled along with the texts published by various experts, newspaper editorials on loans, and relevant data on past loans of the Four Allied Banks, and submitted to the board of directors for discussion on the 19th. It is understood that the loan policy for the 37th year will be revised to some extent compared to the 36th year. The head office of the Four Allied Banks is currently considering the following points, which will be submitted to the board of directors on the 19th: (1) Increase agricultural loans. In the past, the ratio of agricultural loans to industrial loans was two to three, with industrial loans being more than agricultural loans. This year, agricultural loans will be the top priority. Chairman Chiang has instructed the Four Allied Banks to this effect. The Farmers Bank of China has already drafted a plan for this year's agricultural loans. (3) The method of lending will adopt an order-based approach. (4) The principle of lending will be a tight policy, narrowing the scope, and strictly reviewing the scope of loans, initially limiting them to six categories of daily necessities, public utilities, transportation, and export businesses. (4) Regarding loan interest rates, the past low-interest policy easily led to hoarding, and the national banks, bureaus, and treasuries also suffered losses. This year's loan interest rates will be increased. During the discussion on the 19th, the current "Investment Discount Policy" and "Revised Discount Principles" will also be revised in conjunction with the above four points to serve as the loan policy for the 37th year.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance to Adopt a Supervision System to Increase Tax Revenue</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] In order to increase national tax revenue and boost the national treasury, the Ministry of Finance is actively implementing tax improvements. In addition to the adoption of estimated tax payments for profit-seeking enterprise income tax in the 37th year and the full implementation of ad valorem taxation, with tax rates adjusted monthly, the Ministry of Finance is now planning to adopt a supervision system for tax promotion. In the coming six months, the competent tax authorities will prepare a schedule of progress in advance and promote it step by step. If it cannot be implemented accordingly, the Ministry of Finance can supervise it. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun recently convened Director Wang Fuzhou of the Direct Tax Department and Director Jiang Shuge of the Tax Affairs Department to discuss implementation measures. Wang and Jiang have already drafted a semi-annual progress schedule and submitted it to Yu for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Implementation Plan for Grain Rationing in Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou Drafted; Initial Four Months Require More Than 350,000 Tons of Grain <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The grain rationing plan for the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will have an initial trial period of four months, starting in March or April. After the trial period, it will be extended as needed, depending on the actual situation. According to Miao Jianming, chairman of the Sino-American Relief Materials Processing Committee, the committee has drafted an implementation plan stipulating that anyone with residency in the five cities can enjoy this right, receiving one dou [approx. 10 liters] per person, totaling 352,000 tons of grain for four months. Half of this will be allocated from American relief materials, and the other half will be arranged by the Ministry of Food. According to sources in the Ministry of Food, the grain supply has been secured and the distribution will not be a problem, as it is calculated based on the population of the cities, with one dou per person. The grain price has been tentatively set at 5% lower than the market price, and the proceeds from the sales will be used for relief purposes. The relief targets will be national in scope. Furthermore, the grain price for rationed grain will be adjusted monthly.</p>
<p>According to sources in the Ministry of Food: The rationing plan for the five major cities stipulates that each person, regardless of age, will receive one dou, of which five sheng [approx. 5 liters] will be rationed by the government, and five sheng will be relief rice, both priced 5% lower than the market price. There is also one dou for large consumers, which can be purchased from the market with a rationing certificate, with the aim of controlling the market.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yu Feipeng Speaks on Rationing <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] On the eve of the opening of the five-city grain rationing conference, Minister of Food Yu Feipeng spoke about the rationing issue, stating that the reason for selecting the five major cities for initial implementation is that these five cities have dense populations and large consumption volumes. The main reason for adopting grain rationing is to stabilize grain prices and maintain social stability. Yu said with firm conviction as the rationing was about to begin: "I believe that grain prices can be stabilized to a considerable extent after the implementation of the rationing system." The theme of this rationing conference is the discussion of general technical issues, such as coordinating grain sources, determining grain prices, transportation, storage, distribution, and the issuance of purchase certificates. It is also learned that in addition to the mayors and directors of social affairs bureaus of the five cities, the directors of the field and grain departments of Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces, representatives from the Guangzhou and Peiping banks, and units such as the Sino-American Relief Materials Processing Committee, the Central Bank, China Trust Bureau, and the Ministry of Social Affairs are also participating.</p>
<p>The proposals have been submitted to the conference for discussion, and the Sino-American Relief Materials Committee has also drafted measures for rationing and implementation to be submitted to the conference for discussion. The opening was originally scheduled for today, but due to the incomplete attendance, it may be postponed again.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] He Siyuan and Du Jianshi, the mayors of Peiping and Tianjin, respectively, and the directors of the social affairs bureaus of the two cities, are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight to attend the five-city grain conference.</p>

<p>All Countries Should Help Each Other with Rice</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Xie Chengping, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, recently stated the Chinese government's attitude toward the four international conferences related to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), saying: (1) Rice issues: Rice production varies from country to country, but under the principle of helping each other, some people should not be left to starve. Our country's current grain supply is also insufficient, and we are stepping up production to achieve self-sufficiency and cooperate with other countries' grain to exchange what we have for what we lack. (2) Nutrition issues: At this conference, nutritional standards for Asia and the tropics will be drafted, and we will abide by these standards to improve the nutrition of our compatriots. (3) Fisheries issues: China has the longest coastline and is suitable for various aquatic products. Therefore, we propose fisheries improvement to make contributions. (4) FAO Far East Regional Office: We request that it be located in our country.</p>

<p>The Provincial Government Has Ordered a Deadline for Handing Over Weapons</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 15th] The situation of suppressing bandits in southern Fujian is deteriorating rapidly. The Huang Wenbing unit, which has been entrenched in the border areas of Changtai, Tong'an, and Anxi counties for several months, has gradually collapsed under the intensified encirclement and suppression by the National Army. On the 12th of this month, Huang actually sent people to contact the Fifth District Security Command to negotiate surrender. Guo Chun, the commissioner of the district, telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. The Fujian provincial authorities have replied by telegram, setting a deadline of the 15th for handing over weapons and surrendering, otherwise a thorough resolution will be implemented.</p>
<p>[Our Xiamen Dispatch, 15th] On the 10th of this month, Huang Wenbing, a bandit from Changtai, led a unit of more than 300 people to invade Anxi and Daping.

<h3 id="e11">Harrison and Amory Give Speeches; Praising Chairman Chiang's Greatness; Believing that Sino-British Cooperation Can Maintain World Peace <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Harrison, a former member of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, gave a speech at the Sino-British Association tonight, expressing his views on China. He said: "China is now moving towards democracy. For example, the general election is not only a major event for the current people, but also for the future of the country." He expressed his admiration for Chairman Chiang, praising him as one of the greatest figures in the world, and one who is most insightful about world issues. He disagreed with The Times' claim that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is unlike the Soviet Communist Party. He said: "The CCP, the Soviet Communist Party, and the British Communist Party are all the same." He believes that compromise between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP is impossible. He said: "Anyone who persuades the Chinese government to compromise with the CCP is tantamount to asking it to commit suicide." He is confident that despite various difficulties, China can still become one of the greatest countries and the greatest nations on Earth in the near future. Lord Amory, the leader of last year's parliamentary delegation to China, also praised Chairman Chiang and his wife, saying that Chairman Chiang is undoubtedly a great man. Lord Amory was particularly impressed by the enthusiasm and spirit of Chinese university students. Although the buildings of various schools were damaged and the facilities were incomplete, teachers and students still performed remarkably. As for middle school students, they have the spirit of sacrificing for the country, which is China's hope. Lord Amory also said that he laid a wreath at Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum, and said, "People in London feel that Dr. Sun belongs to us almost as much as he belongs to China." He believes that the quickest way to bring China and Britain together is to open up China's waterways for international shipping. He hopes that China will never become as materialistic as Western countries, and lose its ancient philosophy and research in literature and science. If China's economic difficulties can be solved, it will become one of the world's great nations. Lord Amory quoted Foreign Secretary Bevin as saying that if China and Britain can work together, the two countries will be able to maintain world peace forever.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] People in Nanjing are paying close attention to the recent decline in U.S. securities and commodity prices. Relevant people are collecting data, conducting research, and closely watching its development. According to a qualified economic observer speaking to reporters on the 15th, the recent decline in U.S. commodity prices and securities cannot be immediately judged due to a lack of sufficient data, but it can be asserted that this decline is not an economic panic, but only a temporary phenomenon. The reasons for the decline may be the following two: (1) The U.S. had wartime overproduction, and people's purchasing power is weak, but the U.S. is also a country with inflation, and commodity prices and currency should be proportional. The decline in commodity prices is only a temporary phenomenon. (2) It may be due to political reasons, or factional struggles related to the general election. However, no matter what the reason, it will promote the realization of U.S. foreign aid, which will benefit aid to China.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] U.S. government officials believe on the 15th that as the U.S. promotes the political and economic strategy of the Marshall Plan in Europe to stem the expansion of communist forces, the U.S. government will "observe quietly" the Soviet Union in the Far East for the next three or four years, holding its current positions in Japan and South Korea, and focus on defeating communism in Europe. U.S. officials acknowledge that Marshall agreed to propose an aid plan for China this year only to appease Republicans in Congress and maintain a bipartisan foreign policy front. According to reliable sources, Marshall and State Department officials feel that $570 million in aid to China over 15 months is insufficient to alleviate China's suffering.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Our Plan to Support Japan's Reconstruction; China to Support with Conditions; Principle: No Resurgence of Japanese Militarism <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the United States' proposal to the Far Eastern Commission to support Japan's reconstruction plan and seek the agreement of the Allied nations, the Chinese government, after receiving the U.S. note at the end of last month and deliberating for over ten days, has finalized its policy. Foreign Minister Wang met with Ambassador Stuart on the 2nd of this month to discuss the matter, stating that China will support this proposal with conditions, but reserves the right to demand reparations from Japan without being affected by these measures to restore the Japanese economy. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Gu Weijun, our representative to the Far Eastern Commission and Ambassador to the United States, to support the U.S. plan under the general principle of not allowing the resurgence of Japanese militarism and aggression. However, under any circumstances, if the original measures clearly promote Japan's re-entry into the Far Eastern market commercially, threatening the industrial and commercial development of the Allied nations, and causing Japan's old face to re-emerge through financial cliques, thereby embarking on economic expansion and forming the basis for political aggression, China will carefully consider maintaining a firm stance at any time. Foreign Minister Wang touched on this issue in his report to the National Political Council on the 13th, stating: "World peace is indivisible, and the world's economic recovery is equally indivisible," and expressed China's willingness to see the economic recovery of enemy countries. According to an analysis by relevant sources, the government's decision on this issue is not simple. In addition to considering the lessons of Germany after the last World War, so that Japan retains the ability to pay reparations, so as to avoid its economic collapse before the peace treaty is signed, the main reason is to support the Marshall Plan's massive world economic recovery plan. By restoring and stabilizing the social order of countries suffering from war around the world, we seek the necessary conditions for the early arrival of world peace. China has agreed with the U.S. view that even if a peace treaty can be signed at any price, a world full of chaos and famine is insufficient to maintain the peace provided by the treaty. As the opportunity to convene a peace conference is difficult to find, Marshall's method of starting with economic and social stability, in order to maintain the current situation and avoid further confusion, so as to preserve the hope of seeking early peace, or to cope with possible future changes, is still worth considering.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, This City] It is reported that U.S. Ambassador Stuart will rush back to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th to discuss with General Cooke the matter of rescuing the four U.S. Marines rumored to have been captured by the Chinese Communists. However, the ambassador declined to comment on this matter. According to official naval sources here, regarding the missing Marines, apart from what is known in Washington and what is mentioned in other telegrams and broadcast by a Chinese Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi, there is no new information.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 14th] TASS reported on the 14th: "The 'General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army' operating in eastern Shandong has issued a strong protest to the U.S. Navy authorities in China, demanding a guarantee that U.S. officers will not participate in the Chinese civil war, otherwise the U.S. government and the U.S. military will be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom."</p>
<p>The telegram quoted a report from the Chinese Communist side stating that since October 1945, U.S. military personnel have continuously taken very planned "aggressive" actions against the Chinese liberated areas. The main ones are as follows: On October 4, 1945, a U.S. destroyer suddenly entered Yantai, and the captain landed, demanding that the "People's Liberation Army" immediately hand over the administrative power of the city to the U.S. military. In December 1945, the U.S. military occupied Qinhuangdao and turned Qinhuangdao into an outer fortress for the National Army to attack Shanhaiguan, thereby paving the way for the Nationalist troops to go to Shanhaiguan. In June and July 1946, the U.S. military defended the Ping-Shen Railway for the National Army and, in a planned manner, entered eastern Hebei, which was under the control of the "People's Army."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Pearl Harbor, 14th] U.S. Under Secretary of the Navy Kenney announced here on the 14th while hosting a press conference that the 84 American civilians in the Qingdao area, including naval dependents, are currently facing the threat of being surrounded by the Chinese Communists.

Badger left here on the evening of the 14th with Admiral Ramsay, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Admiral Ramsay will spend three weeks inspecting various bases in the Pacific. Vice Admiral Badger said that he was very interested in accepting the new appointment and planned to hold this position for as long as policy permits. The Commander of the Pacific Fleet announced that the closure of various bases in the Pacific has, in fact, been completed. He said that apart from a small amount of materials on Guam and Saipan, the Navy has cleared all remaining materials.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] The British Embassy in Nanjing has confirmed that British nationals in the Northeast and North China threatened areas have been notified to register immediately, except for those who voluntarily risk entering the Communist areas, for evacuation purposes. This confidential advice is a precautionary measure by the British authorities to allow for a quick evacuation of their nationals if necessary. To avoid double evacuations, the British authorities also advised British nationals not to go to areas that will need to be evacuated in the future, but to go to Shanghai and cities south of the Yangtze River. A spokesman for the British Embassy said that this is a precautionary measure taken in view of the lack of aircraft that the British authorities can deploy in China. The U.S. consulates in Shenyang and Changchun have recently been closed, but U.S. Consul General in Shenyang, Walter, has returned to Shenyang after a trip to Washington and is preparing to live with other consulate staff. He had discussed this matter with the U.S. State Department while in Washington.</p>
<p>U.S. Navy to Remain in Qingdao to Train Our Military Students</p>
<p>[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 14th] U.S. Under Secretary of the Navy Kenney told reporters on the 14th that to his knowledge, the U.S. Navy will remain in Qingdao to train Chinese naval students. If the Communist Party occupies Qingdao, the Navy will evacuate American nationals. Qingdao has once again been threatened by the Communists, and there are 814 American nationals in the area. The number of Navy and Marine Corps personnel is unknown.</p>

Educational experts representing seven nationalities will present their valuable opinions on Catholic education issues and plans. It is expected that the conference will make important resolutions on establishing a general organization for Catholic education to promote full cooperation among the dioceses. At a time when the world deeply feels the lack of moral education, and especially today when the Communists are spreading seeds of anti-religion and anti-morality everywhere, a religious group representing the moral authority of the world is holding a conference in this city to conduct a self-examination of the theory and practice of its educational work. This will make a significant contribution to how to reverse the declining trend of modern education in the moral aspect. Although we are unwilling to overstate the significance of this National Catholic Education Conference, saying that it can immediately lead Chinese education uphill, its significance cannot be ignored; at the very least, this conference should be a useful reference for the improvement of Chinese education.</p>
<p>Catholicism has been transmitted to China since the late Ming Dynasty, and it has had a profound influence on Chinese society and culture. The Catholic Church is organized by people who believe in the doctrines and live in human society, and naturally it cannot but have relationships with the real society. All changes and migrations of people and affairs, the rise and fall of society, since Catholicism exists in it, it is naturally impossible not to have contact with it. Moreover, many social problems cannot be solved without ethics, and the ethics and morality of human society are always related to religion. What's more, since Catholicism was introduced into China, it has made great efforts to promote the popularization of education in our country. Therefore, the influence of Catholicism on Chinese society cannot be ignored. Even if the number of Catholic friends across the country reaches four or five million, accounting for one in ten thousand of the total population, it is not comparable to ordinary social groups. Taking education alone, Catholicism attaches special importance to the education of Catholics. All Catholic children, whether in cities or villages, must go to school to read scriptures. Even in remote rural areas, there are schools founded by Catholics. Catholicism not only emphasizes basic education, but also devotes itself to secondary and higher education. Xuhui Middle School and Xuhui Girls' High School in Xujiahui have a history of 81 years and are probably one of the earliest schools in Shanghai. Before our government advocated modern school education, Catholicism had already founded primary and secondary schools all over the country. According to recent statistics, there are 52 boys' middle schools, 36 girls' middle schools, 297 boys' senior elementary schools, 183 girls' senior elementary schools, 2,617 boys' junior elementary schools, and 1,020 girls' junior elementary schools in the country. In addition, there are also 11,523 simplified elementary schools. From this, we can see how developed Catholic education is in the country and how significant its impact on Chinese society and culture is.</p>
<p>If we examine the content of Catholic schools across the country, we can know that Catholic church schools all emphasize the principles of being a person; in their schools, all courses inspire students' conscience, and all activities take into account students' moral cultivation. Therefore, the purpose of Catholic education, in a nutshell, is to integrate school education with social education; in other words, to make society more perfect and to make human life more meaningful. As Archbishop Yu Bin said, "The task of our religious educators is not only to cultivate perfect people and promote morality, but also to make everyone a manifestation of Christ." This educational policy is enough to make up for the shortcomings of our current education. At a time when the world deeply feels the lack of personality education and moral education, Catholic education's emphasis on personality cultivation and moral cultivation is especially worthy of advocacy. Therefore, we hope that this conference, while examining the theory and practice of Catholic education, should uphold the standards of moral education and strive to reverse the declining trend of morality in our country's current education!</p>
<p>If we look at the distribution of Catholic schools across the country, the focus is on North China. Taking Beijing alone, there are 12 Catholic middle schools and one Furen University in the urban area. However, North China has been disturbed by the Communists, and there is almost no clean land. The Communists do all kinds of evil and wantonly destroy religious undertakings in their occupied areas, so Catholics have suffered the most tragic poisoning by the Communists. Cardinal Archbishop Tian Gengxin, who came to Shanghai from Beijing, told reporters from the Central News Agency the day before yesterday: "There are more than two or three thousand Catholics in Beijing who have escaped from various places occupied by the Communists, many of whom have been arrested and detained by the Communists. Although missionary work in the Communist areas of China is now extremely difficult, the church has never considered a plan to withdraw. The reason is that Catholicism has suffered more than a thousand years of tempering from complete or partial suffering in various countries around the world; the difficult history has made us more determined to fight against evil forces." Many of the representatives attending this conference are from North China, and some of them must have suffered poisoning and oppression from the Communists. We would like to pay our sincere respect to them and express our heartfelt admiration for their unyielding spirit. At the same time, we hope that the representatives of various dioceses attending this conference can follow this spirit and fight evil forces to the end.</p>
<p>The Communists are creating disturbances by playing with soldiers, on the one hand, trying to expand their territory by force, and on the other hand, using ideological struggle as a tool to destroy the ethical concepts of human interaction. Therefore, from the perspective of the country and the nation, the Communists are traitors to the country and public enemies of the nation; from the perspective of religion and morality, the Communists are even more enemies of all mankind. In addition to seeking the unity of the church itself and the connection of work, this conference should also pay attention to the development of national spirit and the establishment of righteous concepts. On the active side, take education as a demonstration to achieve the revival of national morality; on the negative side, implement spiritual mobilization, participate in ideological suppression, and crush any poisonous schemes of the Communists to destroy ethics and destroy morality, so that the next generation of citizens of the Republic of China will never fall into the abyss of chaos and suffering created by the Communists.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also study the doctrines of Catholicism. It is definitely not a religion that is out of this world, but should be a positive activism. Catholicism not only has strict precepts and precise organizations, but also has a fearless fighting view of life. Ordinary priests can certainly live in poverty and be happy to die in remote rural areas. There are many such cases in China. As for the general believers, they can also defend themselves at all times and fight at all moments, taking benevolence as the starting point, helping others as happiness, and taking impartiality and peace as the standard, so as to seek welfare for the poor people. This is what is called the "Catholic spirit." Although the scope of discussion at this conference is limited to education, we believe that the most important thing is to promote the Christian teachings of all nations and to be a demonstration of moral education.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Director of Population Bureau Discusses the Preparations for the Census; Determined to Hold it as Scheduled in Two Years <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Ministry of Interior has decided to hold the first national census in Chinese history in 1950. Bao Huiseng, Director of the Population Bureau, today gave reporters a detailed account of the significance and preparations for this pioneering undertaking. Bao first pointed out that the census is a type of basic national survey, which is used to remedy the defects of inconsistent periods and inaccurate books in household registration and household registration. The reason for selecting 1950 to hold it is to seek conformity with the suggestions of the International Statistical Association and the United Nations Population Commission to hold the World Population Census in the year ending in zero in the Western calendar (1950 in the Republic of China), so that it is more valuable in terms of academic and practical use.</p>
<p>Bao also said that the census requires about 850,000 people. The Ministry of Interior has trained more than 300,000 staff at all levels of household administration, and is continuing to train them, hoping that there will be no shortage of manpower within two years, that is, before the census.</p>
<p>Although the census requires a large amount of funds, judging from the past examples of Japan and India, the percentage of the total amount of state expenditure is still small, and the three types of expenses for preparation, investigation, and statistics are not spent in the same year, so raising funds is not too difficult.</p>
<p>Regarding the regulations for the census form, Bao believes that it should be as simple as possible, and only the most basic matters should be investigated. The items listed in the table drafted by the Ministry of Interior only include name, title, gender, age, native place, marital status, education level, and whether they have lived in the county or city for more than six months. Border provinces will add items such as ethnicity, language, and religion. He pointed out that this is only a proposal, and opinions from domestic experts will still be adopted at any time for additions and deletions.</p>
<p>Regarding the sorting out of the first census data in the future, Bao believes that the principle should be to adopt the machine method, but the strip paper (ie card) method may also be adopted. The decision will be made after weighing the objective situation next year, because based on the current wages, prices, and exchange rates, machine sorting is still more cost-effective than the strip paper method.</p>
<p>The Population Bureau's determination to hold the census as scheduled can also be seen in Bao's speech. When answering the reporter's question about whether the census will still be held if the military and financial situation of suppressing bandits cannot be as ideal as expected at that time, he said in a firm tone: The Population Bureau has also considered the method of implementing the census based on the worst situation, that is, even if the bandit disturbances are not quelled and the finances are difficult, the national census can still be held, but the method should be changed, that is, the population in the bandit areas will be replaced by precise estimates instead of the census, and the calculations will be based on historical data and sample surveys. If there are financial difficulties, food or taxes can be implemented in areas where household registration has been processed, so as to use the funds that have been earmarked to handle the census in areas where there is no household registration. If it is still insufficient, it is expected that the difference is limited, and the national treasury can still allocate funds.</p>

<p>35 Factories Intensify Production; Producing More Than 6,000 Metric Tons Per Day</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 15th] Taiwan Province used to have a very rich sugar production. At the beginning of the recovery, the factories were severely damaged, and the sugar industry declined. At this third sugar-making period after the restoration, it is believed to be attracting attention from all parties. It is reported that of the 36 sugar factories under the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, except for the Hengchun factory, which has been temporarily postponed for repairs, the remaining 35 sugar factories have started work one after another. When reporters inspected these factories, they saw towering chimneys and black smoke like clouds. Farmers were busy harvesting in the fields, and trains and trucks transporting sugarcane were constantly on the road, showing a scene of new prosperity, which was not the desolate situation of two years ago. These 35 sugar factories can crush 59,000 metric tons of sugarcane every day, which can produce more than 6,000 metric tons of sugar. By the end of April, nearly 60,000 hectares of raw material sugarcane will be completely crushed, and it is expected to produce about 300,000 metric tons of sugar, an increase of ten times compared with the previous year. In the future, sugar prices will generally fall, so the main plan for competition in the international market is to reduce production costs. It is heard that Taiwan Sugar Corporation is working hard to improve, so as to open up a large outlet for Taiwan sugar.</p>

<p>[Special Correspondent Report from Nanjing, 15th] Xinjiang has sparse rainfall, and farmland cultivation depends entirely on irrigation. The only water source for Dihua (Urumqi) is the Urumqi River, which is insufficient. To increase production, the Ministry of Water Resources has planned the construction of the Urumqi River Reservoir and the Qinggeda Lake Irrigation Project, aiming to store and supply water. The progress of the projects is described below: Project Plans: A. Qinggeda Lake Irrigation Project: (1) Urumqi River Dabocao Aqueduct: This aqueduct crosses the Urumqi River, with a total length of 110 meters, diverting water from the reservoir to the west bank. (2) Main Canal: The main canal connects to the aqueduct, with a total length of 31 kilometers. From the urban area to Heishantou, about 11 kilometers will temporarily utilize the old canal of Chuan Jin Yong, with minor improvements. (3) Inlet Gate, Sand Discharge Gate, and Control Gate. (4) Main Diversion Gate: A main diversion gate will be set up at the end of the main canal, with three branch canals to the east, center, and west, dividing the water here. Each will have a gate opening with equal gate bottom heights and each hole will be 3 meters wide. (5) Branch Canals: Approximately 30 kilometers in total length. (6) Sub-canals and Diversion Gates: Sub-canals will be approximately 50 kilometers in total length. (7) Bridges, Drop Structures, Aqueducts, etc. B. Urumqi River Reservoir Project: (1) Expand the intake canal to allow for the introduction of 10 cubic meters of water per second. (2) Expand the low discharge canal to accommodate a flow rate of 10 cubic meters per second. (3) Rebuild the low-level discharge gate to achieve 10 cubic meters per second. (4) Water Storage Dam: The reservoir has high mountains on three sides and a natural earth dam on one side. The slope of the dam's upstream face is set at 1:2, the outer slope at 1:4, and a central partition wall is added. (5) High Discharge Gate: After the reservoir's water storage level increases to the planned elevation, the water head pressure on the low discharge gate will reach 20 meters. There is a stone beam on the north bank of the reservoir, with a discharge capacity of 10 cubic meters per second, a bottom slope of 1/250, and a length of approximately 100 meters. (6) High Discharge Canal: Approximately 2.3 kilometers in length, connecting to the low water canal downstream. Construction Progress: A. Qinggeda Lake Irrigation Project: (1) Excavation of Canals: Military and civilians cooperated, working day and night to rush the repairs. All were completed by May 20th. (2) Construction of the Urumqi River Aqueduct: All was completed by May 10th. (3) Construction of various buildings on the canals and other important projects have been completed. B. Reservoir Project: Progress is exceptionally difficult.</p>

<p>[Special Correspondent Report from Taiyuan, 15th] There is a shortage of food in Shanxi. It is insufficient to overcome the difficulties unless both increasing production and conserving resources are achieved. Subsidies for food rationing for residents of Taiyuan have become a minor issue. The city is losing over 40 billion yuan per month, making it difficult to continue. It has been decided to change the rationing method starting on the 16th, using labor to offset the food price difference. The method of rationing food price differences will also be abolished. Grain merchants will be allowed to purchase freely with permits. Food cooperatives will purchase and ration food for their members. Members of the Self-Defense Forces, spouses and direct relatives of anti-Japanese and bandit suppression martyrs without the ability to support themselves, and approved relief households will all have food rationed at reduced prices. The losses will be shared by the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government. Rationing will still be based on second-class meals and limited quantities.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Communist Bandits, Under Foreign Instructions, Attempt to Establish a Puppet Organization in the Northeast, Remarks of Bandit Commander Cheng Yaode After Defecting <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] Cheng Yaode, commander of the Fourth Military Sub-district of the Communist Bandit's Yu-Su-Wan Military Region, has specially defected to the National Army, pledging allegiance to the Central Government. According to his remarks to reporters, "The Communist Chinese Central Committee attempted to establish a puppet central government, initially choosing to attack Taiyuan to organize their puppet government. Later, under instructions from their foreign masters, they changed to attacking Changchun or Shenyang in the Northeast. Therefore, the Communist bandits in the Northeast, with the assistance of a certain party, are launching several offensives at all costs to have alien races occupy Changchun or Shenyang and establish a attached puppet organization." Cheng continued, "The Communist bandits' current widespread roaming, their important attempt is the mountain interior line combat, with Liu Bocheng fleeing south to the Dabie Mountains and Tongbai Mountains to establish a 'New Liberated Area' north of the Yangtze River. The Chen Yi bandit group is establishing a 'New Liberated Area' north of the Huai River and south of the Yellow River. Once the foundations of their occupied areas are solid, they will prepare to cross the Yangtze River and advance to the areas east and west of the Yuehan Railway. The Jiangbei area they leave behind will be taken over by Peng Dehuai and Nie Rongzhen. The Lin Biao troops in the Northeast will be escorted into the Guan and areas north of the Yellow River, all adopting a gradual advancement approach. The bandit units of Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Chen Geng have different organizational structures, uneven economic distribution, and depleted food and ammunition supplies. Conflicts of interest often arise within the bandit ranks, leading to friction. There is war-weariness within the Communist bandit ranks, and the number of suicides is increasing daily. They have lost their homes and families, and they have witnessed the Communist bandits' various inhumane atrocities, affecting innocent civilians. The so-called 'liberation,' 'struggle,' and 'democracy,' and their beautiful lies, are causing China's great rivers and mountains to be ruined. Therefore, they are all wandering astray, resulting in tragic suicides due to anger and grief. If the government can promote leniency and provide a path to self-renewal in the areas where the bandits roam, and treat the prisoners well, it can disintegrate the Communist bandits faster than military action." Finally, he said, "The 'Defecting General' Gao Shuxun's bandit unit was completely eliminated by Liu Bocheng in northern Changzhi on July 14 last year. The fate of Gao Shuxun himself is unknown. The Communist bandits strictly prohibit the publication of this news."</p>
<p>Communist Bandit Cadre Defects and Reveals Darkness in Bandit Areas</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] Dong Shaocheng, who served as a cadre working in the Communist Bandit ranks for over four years, defected to the National Army in eastern Hebei, revealing the darkness in the bandit areas, stating: "Intellectuals suffer the most control in the bandit areas. The Communist bandits say that intellectuals have a strong petty bourgeois consciousness, are prone to compromise, and have complex and divergent thoughts. If they express themselves actively, they are called 'petty bourgeois madness'; if they express themselves rigidly, they are accused of 'disappointment and passive intent at work.' Intellectuals can only be echoing insects who blindly praise." Live burial is still practiced in the bandit areas. According to a report by Liang Tianchou, the district chief of Lianhe County, he buried over 80 people alive in one month. The so-called land reform is nothing more than intensifying the contradictions among the farmers. On the one hand, the landowners are forced to dedicate their land, and on the other hand, small farmers are called landlords, feigning enlightenment. After the farmers have divided the land, they are told that they 'must fight to defend the fruits of victory' and are forced to 'join the army.' After several 'expansions of the army,' the youth men have almost all disappeared from the villages in the bandit areas."</p>
<p>Machines Plundered from Northeast by Soviets Transferred to Communist Bandits</p>
<p>[United Press, This City Dispatch] According to neutral people who retreated from Shenyang on the 15th, "The industrial equipment plundered from Northeast China by the Soviets has now been returned to the Communist army's Harbin." This person is a foreigner and is currently en route to Hong Kong. He stated, "According to reliable sources, before he left Shenyang, the Soviets had shipped back to Harbin on ships the factory machinery that was taken away when Japan surrendered. Most of the machinery was still in its original packaging, but the number is unknown." He also pointed out that a recent Communist Chinese communique stated that there are 2,600 kilometers of railways under their control that are open to traffic. If this news is true, it exceeds the railways occupied by the National Army in the Northeast.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Three Powers Determined to Disregard Soviet Protest, London Conference Held as Scheduled, "German State Bank" Established in British and American Zones <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the Soviet Union has sent a note to Britain protesting the upcoming three-power conference in London on the German issue. The Soviet government believes that this conference violates the Potsdam Agreement and declared that the Soviet Union would not recognize any German resolutions decided at this conference. The spokesman also said that the Soviet position would not affect the planning of the meeting, as the conference was well prepared and would proceed as planned. The United States, Britain, and France have agreed on the first item on the agenda, which is to consider the requests from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to participate in the meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] State Department officials said that the Soviet Union has sent a strong note to the United States protesting the upcoming German conference to be held by the United States, Britain, and France. It is expected that the Soviet note can be rejected before the London conference. The note was presented to Deputy Secretary of State Lovett yesterday by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin, and its content is generally the same as the one submitted by the Soviet Union to the British Foreign Office. Officials here believe that the Soviet protest is only a "routine" matter, as the Soviet Union has previously protested the three powers' meeting to discuss the German issue, but without result.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 15th] The military governors of the British and American combined zones in Germany jointly issued a notice announcing the establishment of the "German State Bank," which has the right to issue banknotes and exercise most of the powers previously exercised by the Deutsche Bank. The British and American military governors also announced the establishment of the Allied Banking Commission, which will exercise general supervision over the "German State Bank." The bank is located in Frankfurt and is the only institution in the jurisdiction of its subordinate state banks that issues banknotes. Its nature is equivalent to the Federal Reserve Bank of the state banks, supporting the state banks and maintaining the uniformity of the state banks' policies. The "German State Bank" will also serve as the clearing center for its subordinate state banks and may, in accordance with normal procedures, engage with foreign central banks.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 14th] There is hope here that France will be able to join the "German State Bank" established today after the three-power meeting in London, which is scheduled to begin on the 19th. The itinerary will be discussed in detail by the British and French sides, but a complete agreement has not been reached.</p>
<h3 id="e56">No Signs of Relaxation in Soviet Policy, US-Soviet "Cold War" to Reach Peak This Spring, Both Sides Deny Berlin Secret Talks <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] US government officials today expressed disbelief in reports that Soviet foreign policy showed signs of softening. Officials unanimously agreed that there was no evidence to prove that the Soviet Union was genuinely inclined to take a more cooperative approach with the United States and Western countries. One official pointed out that only two days ago, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin submitted a strong protest to the State Department against the upcoming conference in London by the United States, Britain, and France to discuss western Germany. The speculation arose because of a report that senior US and Soviet officials held an informal meeting in Berlin a few days ago and discussed ending the "Cold War."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The American diplomatic community expects US-Soviet relations to worsen in the next three to six months, after which they may improve. Some people around Secretary of State Marshall said that there is hope for a relaxation of the dispute between East and West within a year. This spring is indeed a critical time, and the central issue of the crisis is the Marshall Plan. If Europe remains in a state of great instability in the future, the Soviet Union will continue to try to gain control of the entire continent, and the United States will encourage European countries to resist all threats from Soviet communism.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 15th] The Soviet Information Bureau here denied rumors that a secret meeting was initiated by the Soviets in Berlin between Marshal Sokolovsky and Murphy, the political adviser to General Clay. The Soviet Information Bureau claimed that the news was "pure fabrication." General Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Germany, also issued a statement to the press denying the rumored US-Soviet talks.</p>
<h3 id="e57">US-Soviet Talks Are Speaking Definitively <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Swiss Capital, 14th] A correspondent for the Radical Democratic Party's newspaper "United Daily News" in Washington reported that "representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union have begun talks in Washington to discuss various long-pending issues between the two countries. All parties are now awaiting the results of these talks. It is said that the US is prepared to allow the Soviet Union to act freely in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, North Korea, and possibly even in Northeast China. But on the other hand, the US will make the following demands to the Soviet Union: (1) The US must be allowed to act freely in Greece; (2) The Soviet Union must stop aiding the Greek guerrilla leader Markos; (3) The Soviet Union must order the French and Italian Communist Parties to reduce their activities; (4) The Soviet Union must withdraw from East Germany.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Well-informed sources here today denied reports that President Truman is trying to resolve the various issues between the US and the Soviet Union. It is said that "military issues between the US and the Soviet Union are currently being discussed by the Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in Germany and the Soviet side. The US has not formally taken action to negotiate with the Soviet Union, nor does the US intend to demand that the Soviet Union withdraw from Germany. If the Soviet Union can truly stop exerting pressure on Greece and the Middle East, and resolve the German issue in good faith, and no longer incite the French and Italian Communist Parties to disrupt the politics and economy of their own countries, then the US believes that it is still possible for it to achieve a de facto peace with the Soviet Union. The US does not want to seek the same spheres of influence in the countries under the Soviet sphere of influence. On the contrary, the US is hoping that the Soviet Union can promote the freedom of the people in these countries. In view of the current situation, the US may not be able to reach an understanding immediately, but due to the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin, the US will be able to handle negotiations with the Soviet side more easily. American leaders have always hoped that the US and the Soviet Union can compromise and move closer."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] General Eisenhower, who retired a week ago to become President of Columbia University, had his report from his time as Chief of Staff of the Army released today by Secretary of the Army Royal.  It warned the United States that it must prepare to deal with attacks in the atomic age. He believes that until all nations have agreed to disarm, the United States must be prepared to repel such attacks. However, he also expressed hope that lasting peace can be established through the United Nations.</p>
<p>This report covers the entire period of U.S. military policy from November 19, 1945, when he succeeded Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army, until his recent retirement. General Eisenhower believes that the current U.S. Army is insufficient to repel atomic attacks, that disarmament has reached a dangerous level and cannot be further reduced. To cope with the threat of atomic attacks, the United States must establish various facilities to defend the American continent and its surrounding bases, and immediately launch retaliatory counter-attacks to defeat the enemy's main force and severely damage their base, in order to achieve peace between the enemy and ourselves. The tragedy of the present era is that the war has just ended, and ideological conflicts have arisen again. Our Western European allies are in dire straits, and some are threatened by militarized political parties whose main purpose is to create chaos in order to achieve the goals of a certain foreign ideology. If these countries abandon their struggle for freedom and become victims of totalitarianism, the security of the United States will also be in danger.</p>

Judging from the trend, the Democratic Party and the National Cooperative Party have adopted a united front, that is, they will insist on Ashida serving as prime minister even in the Diet on the 16th, and if it is not passed, they are resolutely prepared to become an opposition party. On the Liberal Party side, they have consistently advocated for Yoshida to be prime minister. As for the Socialist Party, regardless of whether Ashida or Yoshida becomes prime minister, there is a possibility of another split within the party, so they plan to nominate another candidate, but no candidate has been decided. Because Speaker Matsuoka hopes to nominate and vote in a formal way, and cannot decide on a prime minister, he is bound to implement actual nomination voting, so he telegraphed to members of the Diet in various places on the night of the 14th to return to Tokyo quickly.</p>

<p>An Example of Unyielding Spirit</p>
<p>In the summer of 1940, when Britain's situation at sea became increasingly critical, we had to make new decisions.</p>
<p>On August 4, the day before I left for White Sulphur Springs, British Ambassador Lord Lothian came to see me and expressed his government's "urgent desire" to purchase some older destroyers from us. He said Britain needed them to get through what he considered its "present emergency."</p>
<p>During my attendance at the Havana Conference, the President had been talking with Lothian and communicating by telegram with Prime Minister Churchill on this subject and on the question of Britain possibly ceding or leasing to us some of its bases in the Western Hemisphere. The idea of selling or leasing destroyers was first mooted by French Prime Minister Reynaud on May 14—only four days after the German invasion of France—and seconded by Mr. Churchill the next day.</p>
<p>At that time, the President was opposed to the suggestion.</p>
<p>But everything is relative. After the collapse of France greatly increased our danger, we were more inclined to agree to cede our aging destroyers, if the losses to our national defense caused by the cession could be compensated for in other ways, such as obtaining new bases. The Navy had long hoped to obtain more bases along the Atlantic. We also felt that since our destroyers could strengthen the British Navy, it would in fact increase a layer of protection for ourselves, because the British fleet stood between the Axis countries bent on conquest and us. Moreover, on June 28, 1940, Congress passed a bill proposed by the government, namely the National Defense Act, which allowed the sale of naval equipment, as long as the Director of Naval Operations confirmed that it was not needed for national defense.</p>
<p>When Lothian came to my office on August 4, I was able to fully understand Britain's danger as well as he could describe it. He said that Britain had lost five destroyers in the past week alone. He pointed out that destroyers were extremely important for dealing with submarine activity and other enemy activities in the English Channel, because in the English Channel, large warships could not fully exert their effectiveness.</p>
<p>He said that when I was in Havana, he had discussed this issue with the President and now hoped to put the current situation before me, in the hope that something could be achieved in the coming weeks. He also said that Britain would be willing to let us use naval and air base facilities on some British islands near Central and South America and in Bermuda, as well as an air base in Newfoundland.</p>
<p>I first explained to Lothian that such conveniences would of course benefit all the republics of the Americas. I said, "In accordance with the understanding reached at the Havana Conference and other previous meetings, the United States must cooperate with other American republics if it takes any action."</p>
<p>On the same day, I sent the President a memorandum on the sale of warships and auxiliary vessels, including a draft bill for submission to Congress, so that it could specifically approve the sale. When discussing this draft bill with the President, we both believed that there might be two undesirable aspects to submitting this bill to Congress: one was that it would arouse considerable opposition from isolationists; the other was that it might take several weeks of discussion before it could be passed.</p>
<p>This was the situation when I left Washington. During my three weeks of rest at White Sulphur Springs, I had a private telephone line in my apartment and received a large amount of mail from the Senate every day, so I was closely watching and participating in the destroyer-base negotiations then being handled by the President and Welles. On August 23, a few hours after I returned to Washington, I went to the White House to attend a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>It was there that the President said to me, "Our negotiations with Britain on bases and destroyers have stalled. Please see if you can find a solution."</p>
<p>When I discussed the issue of bases with the President, I found that he personally had an amazing knowledge of almost all of these bases. He had either cruised, or swam, or fished in these harbors. He knew how deep, how wide, and how many ships they could accommodate.</p>
<p>He also knew the poverty of the people on some of the islands, so he was unwilling to take on the responsibility of governing these people. Therefore, during my absence from Washington, he had changed his original straightforward proposal to purchase the bases, and wanted to lease them for ninety-nine years. I originally favored straightforward cession, but now I was willing to agree to the leasing method.</p>
<p>So I set about handling the negotiations, determined to complete them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The next day, when I was reviewing the progress of the negotiations, the White House informed me that the British Ambassador had an appointment with the President on Sunday evening and that Mr. Roosevelt wanted me to attend.</p>
<p>Lothian came to see me fairly early on Sunday afternoon, so we could review the general situation before he spoke with the President that evening. He raised several objections to the proposal given to him by Welles, in his capacity as Acting Secretary of State, on August 19. He said that his government did not like the provision in the American proposal that we had the absolute right to determine and choose the bases we needed, while the British side had no opportunity to speak. His government opposed the method of exchanging destroyers for bases in the proposal, and hoped to exchange them in the form of gifts.</p>
<p>The reason why the latter point became difficult was that Mr. Churchill had clearly spoken of lending bases directly in the form of gifts in a speech on August 20. He did not mention destroyers at all. The Prime Minister felt that exchanging gifts would create a sense of cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic better than haggling over the exchange. He also said that the British public would not scrutinize gifts as closely as exchanges, and would not think it worthwhile for Britain to lend valuable bases in exchange for fifty old destroyers.</p>
<p>But we also had difficulties on our side. Attorney General Jackson believed that the President, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces, had the legal right to sell destroyers to Britain. But if the President did so without special authorization from Congress, he should be able to satisfy Congress by some means, namely that after handing over the destroyers, we could obtain various conveniences in terms of bases, and their value would obviously give us greater security than retaining these fifty destroyers.</p>
<p>More importantly, the President had no power to donate government property to other countries in the form of gifts. I told Lothian this.</p>
<p>That night, I met Lothian at the White House. As we sat waiting for our appointment with the President, I reiterated to him that the President had no power to give away public property.</p>
<p>But when the President received us, I was surprised that Lothian seemed to ignore what I said about the President not being legally able to give public property as a gift, and still put forward the British proposal.</p>
<p>After Lothian finished presenting his arguments, I said for the third time to the Ambassador and for the first time to the President that the President had no power to give away public property as a gift to any government or individual. Mr. Roosevelt immediately agreed with me.</p>
<p>So the President handed the matter over to me, letting Lothian and I work out a solution.</p>
<p>The next morning, I invited State Department legal advisor Hackworth and Justice Department Judge Thompson to my office to find a way to reach a compromise. After a brief discussion, Hackworth suddenly suggested that there could ultimately be a compromise between Churchill's hoped-for exchange of gifts and the legal position of our President that he could not give up the destroyers without obtaining something in exchange.</p>
<p>Since the British had not specifically stated which bases they wanted to lend to us, why not divide them into two categories? The first category would include the bases in Newfoundland and Bermuda. These Britain could lend to us in the form of straightforward gifts. The second category would include the bases around the Caribbean Sea. Because they are close to the Panama Canal, they are more valuable to us strategically. These could be lent to us in exchange for fifty destroyers.</p>
<p>I immediately realized that this was the formula I was looking for.</p>
<p>So we set about redrafting the proposal?</p>
<p>That afternoon, Hackworth and Thompson went to see the President, who agreed to this compromise.</p>
<p>In the draft proposal, the beginning was a guarantee from the British government, which said that if British warships could not approach the territorial waters of the British Isles, "the British fleet will never surrender or scuttle, but will be sent to other ports of the Empire to continue defending the Empire."</p>
<p>Churchill had offered this guarantee in a speech to Parliament on June 4, but I wanted it formally repeated for the sake of transferring the destroyers to Britain.</p>
<p>On August 27, Lothian sent me a very long telegram from Churchill to the President. Churchill signed it himself as "Former Naval Person," agreeing to the earlier proposal made by Lothian, which was to lend British bases in the form of straightforward gifts, which was unacceptable to us.</p>
<p>Churchill was also prepared to guarantee that the British fleet would never be scuttled or surrendered, but argued that it should be done in the form of an exchange of letters between Lothian and me.</p>
<p>He used his usual unyielding spirit, declaring that he did not want the exchange of letters to be made public, because "I think it is much more likely that the German government will cause its fleet or the remnants of its fleet to surrender or scuttle. They have lightly used this method, as you know. You will remember that in a private telegram I gave you a few months ago, I said that if we did this, it would be a cowardly act. Everyone among us thinks so."</p>
<p>Churchill opposed publicizing this guarantee, which he had already stated in a telegram to the President on August 15, when he said: "...Please remember that from our point of view, and perhaps from yours, how harmful it is to allow an impression to grow that we consider the conquest of the British Isles and their bases is not an impossible eventuality. The spirit of our people is excellent."</p>
<p>After Lothian telegraphed the location of the bases that the President had in mind to London, Churchill immediately agreed and also added Anticosti Island in the Caribbean Sea at no cost, saying that this island could be used as a seaplane base.</p>
<p>On that hot evening of August 27, Lothian, Minister Crooks, and Admiral Stark all came to my apartment around 10:30, finding me wearing loose shirts and trousers. The four of us read the draft for more than an hour. Lothian initially made a few suggestions for amendments, but later seemed quite satisfied and said that he would send the content to the government.</p>
<p>At 7:00 p.m. on the night of August 29, Lothian came to my apartment and left me the counter-proposal made by his government. We made slight modifications to the original text, and then called Lothian, who came to my apartment again at 10:30. He agreed to the modifications we had made.</p>
<p>The next day, August 30, I notified the President, who was then at Hyde Park, of the modifications by telephone, and immediately obtained his approval.</p>
<p>Lothian spent the weekend in Boston and returned to Washington on Monday afternoon (September 2), coming to my apartment at 7:00 p.m. that evening. We signed and exchanged notes there, confirming the destroyer-base deal.</p>
<p>Lothian also gave me his reply to a memorandum I had given him earlier, which asked him to guarantee the disposal of the British fleet.</p>
<p>In his reply, Lothian said, "The Ambassador of His Majesty the King is instructed by the Prime Minister to inform Mr. Hull, the Secretary of State, that this statement does indeed represent the established policy of His Majesty's Government. But Mr. Churchill must point out that this hypothetical eventuality is more likely to happen to the German fleet or its remnants than to the British fleet."</p>
<p>The last sentence was added by Churchill himself.</p>
<p>At this point, the most important negotiation in our history was declared over in a week.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Air Transport Drug Trafficking Case Is Complex: Involves Financial Institutions in Corruption; 24 Key Suspects Escorted to the Capital Are Mostly People of Status; Expected that Four Kunming Suspects Will Be Escorted Here Today <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Independent 3rd Battalion of the Shanghai Gendarmerie and Special High Group personnel, together with the Kunming Gendarmerie, cracked down on a large-scale Shanghai-Kunming air transport drug trafficking organization in January of this year, arresting a total of 28 key suspects, including retired general-level officers, active-duty soldiers, central committee members of political parties, university lecturers, and doctors of pharmacology. The circumstances are extremely shocking. After the case was cracked, it was reported to the highest authorities, and Chairman Chiang ordered that all suspects be escorted to the capital, where the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is conducting the interrogation. The investigators also discovered, from the clues obtained in cracking the case, that the China Native Products Company, operated by the main suspect Xie Jun, had committed the serious crime of providing resources to bandits. It was also learned that the company had colluded with a major central financial institution in Shanghai and illegally obtained huge loans. Regarding the above two points, the Gendarmerie is continuing to conduct a rigorous investigation, and a major corruption case may be exposed in the near future.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter learned from responsible sources that the headquarters of the Shanghai-Kunming air transport drug trafficking organization, Xie Hsing Mei Company, is located on Nanhua Street in Kunming, with Chen Jimo as the manager. Yang Zhihe is responsible for contacting transportation, and the person responsible for air transport is named Wu Zikai, who is at large. Wu handed the drugs to Yang Xilin, who packed them on the plane. The drugs were hidden in the tires of a jeep, with each tire capable of hiding at least 160 taels of morphine. The person responsible for liaison in Shanghai was Zhang Haishan, the manager of the Qunyi Bookstore on Fuzhou Road. Zhang lived at a certain number in the Xingye Fang on Shanyin Road, which was also the hiding place for the drugs. The persons responsible for selling the drugs in Shanghai were Xie Jun and his brother Xie Songnian, who lived at 327 Haifang Road.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Native Products Company Suspected of Aiding Bandits <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Xie Jun is from Nanchang and has served as a major general deputy division commander and chief of staff. He is currently the chairman of the China Native Products Company, lives luxuriously, has extensive social connections, and interacts with famous figures in Shanghai. Gendarmerie personnel initially received a confidential report that the hemp purchased by the China Native Products Company was suspected of being used to aid bandits, and began an investigation, paying attention to Xie Jun's actions. They discovered that many of the people he interacted with were air force personnel, and many were visitors from Kunming of unknown identity. These Kunming travelers lived in the Oriental Hotel, Dongan Hotel, Yangtze Hotel, etc., acted suspiciously, and lived extravagantly. They frequently exchanged suspicious telegrams and letters with Kunming every day. Most of the sending and receiving locations for these telegrams and letters were Yang Zhihe in Kunming, so the Kunming Gendarmerie was notified to pay attention to and investigate Yang Zhihe.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Following Clues to Track Down Drugs <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>On New Year's Day of this year, the Kunming Gendarmerie, based on the clues provided by Shanghai, discovered at Yang Zhihe's residence that an air force personnel (Wu Zikai) was carrying out a jeep tire, which was very suspicious. They also learned that the tire was transported to Shanghai by plane, and immediately telegraphed the Independent 3rd Battalion of the Shanghai Gendarmerie to send personnel to wait at the airport. Several people, including Yang Xilin, arrived that day. Yang had a mistress in Shanghai and was eager to visit her after arriving in Shanghai, so he handed the drugs over to Yu Qingci and Yang Xun (at large), who worked at the Jiangwan Airport, for transfer to Zhang Haishan, the liaison person in Shanghai. However, Yang Xun et al. demanded an extra 200 million yuan in transportation fees from Zhang Haishan, which Zhang refused to pay, so he did not receive the drugs. Yang Xun et al. then directly contacted Xie Songnian, who was responsible for sales. Xie Songnian borrowed a certain celebrity's car, drove to the place to pick up the drugs, and issued a bad check for 80 million yuan to Yang Xun, transporting the drugs to 327 Haifang Road. All of the above situations were fully detected by the Gendarmerie personnel.</p>
<h3 id="e71">List of Suspects Escorted to the Capital <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. on January 9, Shanghai Gendarmerie personnel divided into eight groups and set out for 327 Haifang Road and other places, starting the work of arresting suspects. Within three hours, except for a few who were at large, a total of 59 suspects and suspects were arrested. Among them, 35 suspects have been released on bail, and 24 key suspects have been escorted to the capital for interrogation. The list is as follows: Xie Jun, Xie Songnian, Xie Chen Xiuying (Xie Jun's wife), Liu Rongbo (a university lecturer), Shi Ming (Doctor of Pharmacology from the University of Berlin, Germany), Xiao Shixian (a middle school teacher), Zhou Chunwei (a stationery merchant), Zhang Wenjie (Central Executive Committee member of the Zhonghe Party and Executive Committee member of the Yunnan Provincial Party Department of the Minshe Party), Xie Shenxing (a salt merchant), Jin Baoguang (a department store merchant), Li Yin'nan, Xia Yu, Zeng Qingjun, Yang Mingda (above are retired military personnel), Ma Jiwu, Zhang Tongbang, Yu Qifeng, Yu Qianci, Yang Xilin, Lu Chaoying, Chen Fubao, Cheng Kemeng, Huang Yuyang (some of the above are active duty military personnel), Zhang Haishan (manager of Qunyi Bookstore).</p>
<h3 id="e72">Cipher Book Confirms Suspicions <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Among those arrested at 327 Haifang Road were Xie Jun and his wife, Xie Songnian, Zeng Qingjun, Xiao Shixian, Shi Ming, Ma Jiwu, and others. At the time, Xie Jun was suffering from hematemesis and was lying in bed. The investigators first entered as electrical wire inspectors. During the search, no drugs were initially found, but later 160 taels of morphine and incoming and outgoing account books and a cipher book were found in the layered springs of Xie Jun's bed. The telegrams that had been intercepted before were translated using the cipher book, which were strong evidence of their transportation and sale of drugs. The suspects could not deny it and surrendered.</p>
<p>After the drug traffickers in Shanghai were arrested, the Kunming Gendarmerie arrested the four main suspects, Chen Jimo, Yang Zhihe, Wu Yongqing, and Tang Zibin, on January 11. It was originally scheduled to escort them to Shanghai by plane on the 15th for transfer to Nanjing for joint trial, but the plane did not take off on the 15th due to bad weather. It is expected that they will be escorted to Shanghai today.</p>

<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) At the end of the lunar year, travelers from various places in Shanghai returned to their hometowns to celebrate the New Year. Now that the New Year has passed, the number of passengers arriving in Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines has become overcrowded again.

<h3 id="e76">Major Tragedy on the First Day of the New Year: Sixteen People Burned to Death on Fuyou Road; A Careless Family of Over Thirty People Cooking Dim Sum Causes the Disaster <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) The houses along the Guanyinge Street section of Fuyou Road, east of the City God Temple in the Nanshi district, are all old, single-story, Western-style urban houses. Most of the residents are laborers. Fang Xia Youxiang, a 44-year-old woman from Ningbo, was the second landlord of Room 2 on the second floor of No. 73. She lived in the two-story building with her son-in-law, Hu Asi (35 years old, from Zhejiang, dealing in American goods), Hu's wife, Xiao Mao (25 years old), Hu's son, Hongbao, and Hu's daughter, Cuizhen (9 years old). The second floor attic was rented to Yuan Quanfa, a cook at a dining hall, and his family of five: his wife, Yuan Xingyue, his daughter, Yuan Guizhen (3 years old), his youngest daughter, Acui, who was only a few months old, and a fostered infant, one year old. The third floor attic was rented to a group of single men, commonly known as "shared bed renters," numbering more than ten people. Each person paid a monthly rent of 30,000 yuan. Most of these people were dockworkers.</p>
<p>Hu Asi hosted gambling gatherings every night, profiting from commissions. The players were all tenants from the third floor. Yesterday morning, the gambling continued until about 4 a.m. before breaking up. Later, Hu lit a kerosene stove to cook dim sum. Beside it was a large package of American matches and a can of kerosene. Due to carelessness, after falling asleep, sparks fell down and spread, eventually causing the flames to break through the roof. It was 6 a.m. The North District Fire Brigade was informed and dispatched all firefighters led by Director Li Zhiliang to rush to the scene to put out the fire. At the same time, the Xin Kaihe Fire Brigade and fire brigades from the Western District and Songshan District also rushed to the scene to provide assistance. However, due to the narrow streets, fire trucks could not reach directly and had to connect hoses to fight the fire. By this time, the fire was raging, and only half of the more than thirty people living inside escaped. Firefighters worked hard to control the fire, and only the facade of the adjacent No. 71 building was affected.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, Shen, the chief of the City God Temple Police Sub-bureau, ordered Zhou Nan, the chief of the criminal investigation section, to lead section members Fan Boxiong, officers Sun Ziqiang, Wang Wenjie, Hong Yucheng, and several uniformed police officers to the fire scene to maintain order. After more than two hours, the fire was completely extinguished. Hu Asi, the source of the fire, was taken to the police station by police officers to inquire about the cause of the fire. His wife, Hu Fang, suffered burns on her left hand and face and was sent to the hospital for treatment. More than ten men and women from upstairs and downstairs who jumped out of the building to escape were mostly naked and in a state of great disarray. Fortunately, none of them were injured.</p>
<p>Subsequently, firefighters began to excavate and found a total of sixteen male and female corpses in four separate incidents. They were identified as: Fang Xia Youxiang, the second landlord; Hongbao, his son; Hu Cuizhen, his niece; Chen Rongsheng (34 years old, from Yangzhou, laborer); Shi Chungui (48 years old, from Ningbo, laborer); Xiao Pudong (laborer); Yuan Quanfa; Lao He; Wang Aying (25 years old); Yuan Guizhen; Yuan Xingyue; Yuan Acui; Fang Wenqing (15 years old); Dong Zili; Xu Jidao; and Yuan's one-year-old child. All were charred beyond recognition, a tragic sight. One male corpse and two children's corpses were dismembered, making the scene even more horrific. The bodies were then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall and placed in a room, pending inspection by the District Procuratorate this morning before being placed in coffins.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Grand Gathering at Lake Society: Commemorating Drama Festival; Pan Gongzhan Urges the Drama Circle to Research and Improve, to Achieve Purification and Beautification of Life; Ninety-Six Film Practitioners Receive Medals <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) Yesterday was the 37th National Drama Festival. The Shanghai Municipal Culture Movement Committee, together with people from the drama circle, held a grand commemorative meeting at the Lake Society Auditorium at 11:00 a.m. Those who attended included Luo Xuelian, Zheng Junli, Ma Xu Weibang, Xu Xinfu, Meng Junmou, Xia Yunhu, Ren Zongde, Li Dacen, Bai Yang, Shangguan Yunzhu, Yan Gongshang, Wu Yin, Ouyang Hongying, Qin Xiaolong, and others from the film industry; Xiong Foxi, a representative from the drama circle; Zhou Xinfang, a representative from the Peking opera circle; Dong Tianmin, a representative from the performing arts association; Yang Binkui, a representative from the Pingtan Research Association; and representatives from the Chang Xiwen Opera Research Association, Shanghai Opera Research Association, Su Tan Research Association, Jianghuai Opera Association, Yue Opera Workers' Union, Comic Opera Research Association, Drama Research Association, Actors' Union, Weiyang Opera Research Association, Xianyu Opera Troupe, Technical Society, and Juan Opera Research Association, totaling about 500 people. Guizhou Road was bustling with traffic, and the Lake Society inside and outside was filled with beautifully dressed people. It was truly a grand gathering in the drama circle this year. Most of the people in the drama circle who attended the meeting were meeting for the first time after the lunar new year, so there was a lot of "Congratulations" being said in the venue, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the Culture Movement Committee, gave a speech, stating that drama is a comprehensive art that integrates all truth, goodness, and beauty, and it bears a very important mission. In the past, the drama circle has been sticking to its position, working hard on research, and has already shown excellent results in all aspects. However, drama should not be satisfied with simply being realistic, touching, or reflecting life, but should aim to achieve the highest goals of purifying life and beautifying life. Especially in Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather and various dramas are performed, the direct impact on the education of citizens is quite large. Therefore, he hoped that drama workers would not only fully utilize their past seriousness, loyalty, and perseverance towards drama and life, but also maintain unity, contact and observe, research and improve, so that drama can fulfill its function and follow the times to carry forward and develop. At the end of his speech, Pan expressed his renewed gratitude to the Peking opera circle for their charity performance in the previous year to donate funds to the Culture Movement Zhongzheng Culture Award.</p>
<p>Veteran of the Theater World Wins Applause from the Entire Audience</p>
<p>Then, Xiong Foxi, on behalf of the drama circle, gave a speech, saying that drama has an educational mission, but our country spends a lot of money on education, and has not heard of using extra resources to cultivate drama workers. He believes that everyone cannot leave the word "study" throughout their lives, and the places for learning, in addition to schools, are the large society. However, those who know the society most clearly and intimately are the theaters. Drama performances have joy, anger, sadness, and happiness, but these joys, angers, sadnesses, and happinesses contain infinite truths of life. He advocates that only "imparting education through drama" is the ideal way out for the drama circle and the education circle in the future, so he calls on drama workers to enrich themselves, study skills, endure hardships, and jointly seek the revival of Chinese drama. Xiong has devoted himself to the drama movement for decades, and is strong in his old age. He is one of the veterans of today's theater world. Yesterday, in his long beard, he expressed his sincere hopes to the entire drama circle, and his enthusiasm won applause from the entire audience.</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Xinfang gave a speech, saying that drama is permanent, but the life of actors is limited. For the sake of the next generation, the drama circle should change its interest in supporting actors to reforming and enriching drama. He said that in recent years, the film industry has developed, which has had a great impact on Peking opera. Many Peking opera theaters in the city have recently been converted into cinemas, so Peking opera actors have gone to Taiwan, the Philippines, and other places to perform and make a living. If this continues, the unemployment problem of Peking opera practitioners may gradually become serious. Therefore, he called on Peking opera workers to adopt modern consciousness and equipment, and work hard to improve in order to keep up with the times, so as not to become a sacrifice in the entire drama.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Observation Performance to Be Held Today <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Then, Wang Xiaoyu, on behalf of the social elite, Luo Xuelian, on behalf of the film industry, Dong Tianmin, on behalf of the performing arts industry, and finally Tan Yimin, the director of the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, gave speeches, hoping that drama work would be in line with the era's mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Finally, Yu Wen, the deputy chairman of the Culture Movement Committee, reported on the preparations and program procedures for the observation performance celebrating this year's Drama Festival. The observation performance is scheduled to begin at 11:00 a.m. today and end at 6:00 p.m. At that time, actors of various dramas or other technologies will show their skills, and it is expected that it will be an unprecedented event.</p>
<p>Award Ceremony</p>
<p>Finally, Pan Gongzhan presided over the award ceremony for the 36th Zhongzheng Culture Award-winning films of the Culture Movement Association. In addition to each of the ten film production companies receiving a large group medal, the directors, actors, set designers, and sound engineers of each film received a small medal. The award-winning personnel for each film included: "The Spring River Flows East" (15 people), "Skirt Wind" (8 people), "Mother and Son" (13 people), "On the Songhua River" (9 people), "The End of Spring Dreams" (11 people), "Top Secret" (9 people), "Where is the Jade Beauty" (9 people), "Distant Love" (11 people), "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon" (8 people), and "China's Resistance" (3 people), totaling 96 people. Except for the representatives of Wenhua and Changchun, who were temporarily absent and whose medals were reserved on their behalf, the rest were received by representatives of each company, who distributed them to the actors, who smiled and accepted them, expressing infinite excitement.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) According to relevant sources, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Bandit has secretly ordered underground cadres at all levels to report in detail the process of the labor and student movement struggles before the Lunar New Year of 1947, in order to summarize and review the gains and losses. At the same time, it made the following brief comments on the year-end struggle: "We especially emphasized that the 'Kowloon Incident Student Joint Demonstration', the 'January 28 Tongji Student Tide', the 'Unprecedented Joint Hunger Strike of the Wool Textile Industry', and the 'Dance Industry Crowd Demanding Lifting of the Ban and Riot' in the year-end struggle were all able to follow our instructions and seize the opportunity to launch anti-Chiang and anti-American movements to raise the masses' struggle mood. The government was in a hurry and mobilized a large number of military and police services, and did not hesitate to use force to create bloody tragedies to suppress them, so that its false democracy and dictatorial ferocious faces were fully exposed to the broad masses of the people. This point has been quite successful. However, we failed to coordinate the labor and student movements, and failed to raise the struggle to the stage of civil unrest as much as possible. What deserves our attention even more is that the year-end struggle failed to affect the workers in the public utilities of important units. We believe that this is a major shortcoming in the leadership of comrades at all levels, and we need to be vigilant and review it in order to welcome the arrival of a new revolutionary upsurge."</p>

<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) Since the central government decided to hold special donations for relief, the city has decided to establish a fundraising committee for special donations for relief, with Mayor Wu serving as the chairman, Pan Gongzhan and Du Yuesheng as the vice chairmen. According to Shen Zonglian, the secretary-general of the municipal government, the date of establishment of the special donation fundraising committee may be around the end of this month. At a time when property registration has not yet been held, it is quite difficult to promote fundraising work. The fundraising targets may be to open a list of wealthy people in society, estimate the value of their property, and then rigidly stipulate the amount of their donations.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the Suppression Propaganda Team still mobilized in the rain as usual to carry out propaganda. The propaganda team of displaced students also cooperated in the action, which was very effective. A total of more than 100 team members were mobilized. The disguised propaganda team, led by Chen Songqing and Yong Dafu, took three propaganda trucks and set off from Fuming Village to tour the city, distributing leaflets and cartoons along the way, shouting slogans, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. They also performed street plays at Beixinjing Town, Hongqiao Town, Fahua Town, and Dashimingzhong, describing the atrocities of the Communist bandits. The lecture team, led by Dong Qichen, lectured on the significance of suppressing the rebellion and bandits in dance halls such as Central, Yangtze, and Silvers, theaters such as China, Jincheng, and Tianchan, and radio stations such as Greater China and Yuanchang. The propaganda team of displaced students, led by Gong Yunting and Yang Yisheng, was responsible for giving lectures and propaganda in various theaters, radio stations, and dance halls.</p>

<p>Cui Xiangsheng, 41, from Nantong, opened a transportation company at No. 27 Lane (Yuren Lane), Yunnan Road, this city. After the victory, he was suddenly reported to the Central Bureau of Statistics for the crime of treason. The reason was that in 1944, Cui and his father-in-law, Yuan Pengfei, and a Japanese Korean, Yoshihara Masa, organized the pseudo Brick and Tile Shipping Industry Association, with Yuan leading the way, Cui serving as the director and secretary-general, and Yoshihara serving as the association's instructor. He once forcibly pulled civilian ships for the enemy, and transported bricks and tiles from Xia Dianmiao near Jiaxing to Shanghai for the enemy's naval department, obtaining illegal profits. After investigation by the Central Bureau of Statistics, he was transferred to the High Court for trial. It is now known that the case has been concluded after several trials by the High Court. Yesterday, Cui Xiangsheng was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights for colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country. All property except for the necessary living expenses for family members was confiscated.</p>

<p>According to the Winter Relief Association's Fundraising Committee, since the launch of the fundraising campaign, it has received a total of 21,193,322,4138 yuan in donations. Among them, the film industry's fundraising has not yet ended, and donations are being raised one after another.

<p>In addition, the sales of the charity housing lottery tickets issued by the association's housing sales department increased sharply during the Spring Festival. Many shops, firms, post offices, and companies that sell tickets on behalf of the association contact the association every day to receive new tickets.</p>
<p>In order to suppress prices, the municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to strictly implement the measures for cracking down on hoarding and speculating on daily necessities during extraordinary periods issued by the Executive Yuan, and the Economic Affairs Department's newly revised implementation notes for the measures. According to the person in charge of the municipal government, the implementation of warehouse inspection and material registration may be too disturbing to the people. In order to prevent abuses, the implementation has been temporarily suspended. The two bureaus, Social Affairs and Police, will handle the matter in accordance with the measures for cracking down on hoarding and speculating on daily necessities, and reward those who report it in secret. The price of daily necessities can be expected to be suppressed.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Dayong Bloodshed: Cause and Effect – County Magistrate Killed by Local Militia – Huang Yingchuan’s Blood Stains the Suburbs <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changsha, 8th] Huang Yingchuan, the newly appointed county magistrate of Dayong, Hunan, was refused entry and shot dead in the suburbs on January 28th. The news caused shockwaves everywhere. Following the incident, this reporter repeatedly visited relevant parties to investigate the cause and effect. A summary is presented below:</p>
<p>Starting from a Broader Perspective</p>
<p>Dayong is a corner of western Hunan, a remote mountainous town with a closed-off location and a strong-willed populace. In recent years, local factions here have been engaged in extremely fierce disputes. Huang Yingchuan’s assassination was a sacrifice made in the conflict between these "local factions." Below, the reporter will write about the course of these local factional conflicts. For ease of narration, let us assume it is a struggle between faction A and faction B.</p>
<p>Last May, the provincial government replaced the county magistrate with a new appointee, Tian Tingyu, a classmate of Chairman Wang from Baoding Military Academy. He was transferred from the position of Chief Instructor of the Provincial Cadre Training Corps. He was a native of Dayong and a very detached figure, seemingly a suitable choice. However, at that time, the communist bandits Wang Dinglie and Li Renlin were causing trouble in western Hunan. The heads of townships and towns in Dayong were originally chosen by the local gentry. Now, with the bandits approaching, it naturally became a pacification zone. The township heads and militia leaders had to be appointed by the county government. Tian had not yet taken office, and the old magistrate was in the provincial capital. The county government was run by the old magistrate's chief secretary. During this vacuum period, people from faction B seized the opportunity to coerce the county government into appointing a batch of township heads. When Tian arrived, they made a demand, wanting the new magistrate to acknowledge the legality of the old magistrate's appointments. Tian refused, and faction B believed that the county magistrate was showing favoritism towards faction A. Thus, they mobilized the local militia, approaching the county seat to demonstrate. The county government then announced martial law, and the police force was dispatched to patrol. Unfortunately, on May 7th, patrolling police were ambushed by the militia at the Guanyin Bridge outside the south gate, leading to the sensational so-called "May 7th Incident" that shook Hunan. At the time, Chairman Wang was inspecting western Hunan and was in Cili. Upon hearing the report on the 8th, he rushed to Dayong. Xiong Wugong fled. Chairman Wang dismissed Magistrate Tian, who had only been in office for five days, and transferred Li Shanhou, the Deputy Commander of the 9th Pacification District, to succeed him and handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>The Campaign to Oust Li Unfolds</p>
<p>Magistrate Li Shanhou was also a graduate of the Baoding Military Academy, and he was over fifty years old. This person was roughly similar to Tian, considered a detached figure. After the "May 7th Incident," this debt was attributed to faction B. Faction B's leader, Speaker Xiong Wugong, had fled and had not returned to the county. Magistrate Li naturally looked unfavorably upon faction B's actions and intentionally or unintentionally associated with people from faction A. Therefore, in the eyes of faction B, Li was the county magistrate of faction A, and they thought of ways to oust him every day.</p>
<p>This was the period of faction A's greatest prosperity. Faction B suffered a series of setbacks from then on, and everyone was uneasy. Thus, they launched a campaign to oust Li. Undoubtedly, if faction B wanted to oust Li, faction A would naturally support him. In the end, the ousting faction won, and the provincial government announced Huang Yingchuan's appointment as the county magistrate of Dayong.</p>
<p>Huang was a native of Baojing, a graduate of the 8th class of the Central Military Academy, 37 years old, and had served as the captain of the Hunan Security Brigade. He was currently a councilor in Baojing. When the provincial government's order was announced, it was like a bolt from the blue for people from faction A in Dayong, like a death sentence to them. Moreover, since people from Chu often spread rumors, rumors were rampant, saying that Huang would severely suppress faction A after taking office. As mentioned earlier, the people of Dayong are savage. If faction B could stage the "May 7th Incident," faction A might well stage another one.</p>
<p>After Huang received his appointment, he heard that the atmosphere in the county was unfavorable. The appointment was announced before the election of legislators, but he delayed his departure to avoid affecting the election. It was not until after the legislative election that he set out to take office. Unfortunately, he was assassinated halfway there. It was a truly tragic event.</p>
<p>A Letter from Huang Qi</p>
<p>Huang Yingchuan's younger brother, Huang Qi, came to the provincial capital from western Hunan on the 6th and submitted a letter to Chairman Wang, describing the tragic death of his brother. It was based on the account of the guards who accompanied Magistrate Huang to his new post and was extremely detailed. The gist was: Magistrate Huang departed from the provincial capital on January 17th, passing through Baojing and Yongshun to take office. On the 27th, he stayed at Houping in Dayong. At 3 PM on the 28th, he arrived at Zhangshu, a place outside the west gate of the county seat (about five li from the city), to rest. Suddenly, two old friends came to greet him and informed him that the city was currently under martial law, and slogans against Huang and supporting Li were plastered all over the streets. Soldiers were densely stationed around the city, determined to resist his entry into the city by force. They advised him not to enter the city to avoid accidents. Huang replied that his primary urgent task in coming to Dayong was to eliminate local disputes, and he himself stood purely on the government's detached position, with no favors or grudges towards any party. There was no need to worry too much. He instructed guard Peng to accompany him, while another guard, Xiang, temporarily stayed in place. He handed his self-defense pistol to Xiang. He also instructed Peng to leave his pistol with Xiang. Then, he, along with his entourage Cheng Mianzhi and Peng, entered the city. Unexpectedly, just as they reached the city gate, after walking only a few steps, someone raised a gun and shot him in the head. A soldier next to him also shot him with a rifle. He died instantly. Cheng and Peng were also killed at the same time. Guard Peng had not followed instructions beforehand and still kept his pistol inside his coat to prevent accidents. At that time, he wanted to take out his gun to protect him, but he was grabbed and held by two people empty-handed, and his gun was also snatched away. He struggled to break free and fled out of the city. Although he was shot at by soldiers above and below the city gate, he luckily escaped. (See "Letter to Chairman Wang")</p>
<p>Seemingly a State of War</p>
<p>After the incident, telecommunications were immediately cut off. After days of turmoil, the county's telecommunications were finally reestablished on the 6th. According to reports, the county seat was controlled by the "Support Li and Reject Huang" faction, while the area outside the city was controlled by the "Oust Li and Support Huang" faction. Both sides used local militias as their capital. High walls and deep trenches were built inside and outside the city, seemingly creating a state of war. People were panicked and living in constant fear. On the 7th, the county council, the county headquarters, and people from all walks of life sent a telegram to the provincial government, reporting the Dayong tragedy. They claimed that when Magistrate Huang came to Dayong to take office, he led hundreds of soldiers and guns, rushing into the city and declaring that he would slaughter the people who supported Li and rejected Huang. The people were outraged and unrestrained, leading to a firefight between the two sides. Huang Yingchuan was killed in the chaos. The above report differs significantly from the account given by Huang Yingchuan's younger brother, so it is recorded here for reference.</p>
<p>How to handle the Dayong tragedy is a tricky situation. The government authorities should first focus on eliminating the competition between local forces and punish the murderers. Otherwise, this case will inevitably fall into a deteriorating situation of escalating events and local rot. (Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru)</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Changshu, 14th] The Jiangsu Construction Department previously requested the provincial government to approve the monthly interest rate for pawnshops based on the rates in Beijing and Shanghai. It has now received instructions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs that the interest and handling fees must not exceed thirty cents, and it has been relayed to all counties for compliance.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 15th] The second expansion and merger of townships in this county will be implemented before the end of this month. The 139 townships in the county will be merged into 59 townships, resulting in numerous disputes due to the large number of townships being merged. All the township representatives from Zhifeng, Fengqiao, and Shi Jiang townships in the western district of Wuxian County, arguing that Councilor Mao Junjie, who was produced by their township, failed to represent public opinion. After fierce argument, they impeached him on the 14th, based on the Provisional Regulations for the Organization of the Council. On the 15th, more than a thousand villagers from Datang Township came to the city to petition in groups because they were being merged. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo believed that the villagers came to the city collectively, disrupting order, and that someone must have instigated and incited them. He decided to investigate the instigators and punish them.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Yangqiao Bridge over the Wo River in Hao County: Seven Arches Burned by Bandits <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hao County, 9th] A large wooden bridge over the Wo River in the urban area of Hao County was built by the enemy and puppet regime during the occupation. The bridge had 14 arches, a grand construction. More than 40 bandits suddenly sneaked into the northern end of the bridge a few days ago, poured kerosene all over it, and set it on fire for about half an hour. The local team and the civilian fire brigade extinguished the fire, destroying seven arches of the bridge. The bridge deck collapsed accordingly. Without major repairs, it will not be possible to restore it to its original state. This bridge is located south of Chechengjiao and north of Wobeizhai. Since the general blockhouse of Wobeizhai was destroyed by bandits on November 4th last year, it has no defenses. However, it is separated from Beiguanzhai by a river, facing each other, and it is easy to watch. Therefore, it has not been defended, and the bandits took advantage of the darkness to sabotage it, which seems to be a planned conspiracy.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek is one of the three major rivers in Shanghai. The river runs across the city, passing through Jiading and Qingpu, entering Kunshan and reaching Wuxian. In the past ten years, it has become increasingly silted. The Public Works Bureau is currently formulating a remediation plan, deciding to start with dredging. It is estimated that the entire dredging can be completed within four years.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi, 14th] From 3 AM on the eve of the Lunar New Year, merchants and residents in the city set off firecrackers to welcome the new year. By 8 AM, the noise began to subside. On New Year's Day, the weather was clear, and the city was filled with tourists, especially at Chong'an Temple. From the next day, movie theaters were full, and the streets were filled with beggars, mostly from northern Jiangsu appealing for relief. There was a constant stream of people asking for help. In recent days, there were also many foreign performers dancing the Qilin and lion dance in the city. On the God of Wealth Day, there was an additional type of performer dressed as the God of Wealth, wearing theatrical costumes, entering houses to dance, holding gold ingots, and begging for legal tender and sweets. When dancing, they were accompanied by gongs and drums, and children gathered around to watch and enjoy. This morning, some performers dressed as the God of Wealth snatched things from the Meixin Watch Shop on the street and even broke the glass. Policeman Meng Shengxi brought the "living God of Wealth" to the Eastern District Police Station for detention and confiscated the "gold ingots." Other police stations also detained five people, including Li Youzhang, and gave them minor punishments as a warning.</p>

Therefore, today's world has no two paths to follow; otherwise, it will inevitably lead to destruction. If the ideal of the world as one family is not realized, humanity will perish; but to achieve this goal, we must promote the idea of one person in the world. One person in the world is the ideal of Catholicism. The task of religious educators is to cultivate perfect people and promote morality. Our highest ideal is to become great incarnations of Christ for every individual." After the Mass, the conference opened. First, Nuncio Li delivered a speech, saying: I have inspected various parts of the country and deeply feel that China has gone through hardships in the eight years of the War of Resistance, and is still able to invigorate its spirit and strive for construction, which is admirable. In this situation, our Catholic education must make a great determination and not become negative due to environmental difficulties. At today's conference, everyone has traveled a long way to participate in Shanghai, all to educate the public. In the future, evangelism and education work must be combined with the spirit of the Chinese nation's pursuit of progress and strive to move forward.

<h3 id="e117">Shanghai Team's Glorious Battle: Defeats Hong Kong Chinese Selection 2-1, Zhang Banglun Still the Best Performer, Shanghai Team's Forward Line Shows Vitality <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hong Kong Airmail] History repeats itself. Last year, the Shanghai team defeated the Hong Kong Chinese Selection team 1-0. This year, the Shanghai team again won against the Chinese Selection team 2-1. This year, the Hong Kong Chinese Selection team has a wealth of talent. It is truly glorious for the Shanghai team to defeat the Chinese Selection team. This was the battle on February 11th, and the battlefield was still at Happy Valley. As a result of the battle, the Shanghai team scored first in the first half, and in the second half it was 1-1. The Chinese Selection team was unable to reverse the situation. The Hong Kong Chinese Selection team's lineup for this battle remained as originally planned, while the Shanghai team made slight changes.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Li Yichen Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Hannibo Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Li Xia Tixian Robert Stoff Han Longhai Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chinese Selection Team</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Feng Kunsheng Song Sheng Liu Songsheng</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou Li Zhaorong Chen Dehui Feng Jingxiang Xie Jinhe</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chinese Selection Team's Strategic Failure</p>
<p>If compared in terms of lineup, I still believe that the Shanghai team is not superior to the Hong Kong team, but the Hong Kong team ultimately lost. Originally, the wings of the Chinese Selection team were truly not suitable for use on the field. We had already pointed this out when selecting the players. Who knew that Li Zhaorong also underperformed, with "inaccurate passes" and "weak shots." The entire forward line was only supported by Feng Jingxiang. It was naturally impossible for this forward line to score.</p>
<p>Strategically, the Chinese Selection team also made the biggest mistake. Seeing that the Shanghai team was tall, they still relied on high crosses. The wings were unwilling to dribble in after getting the ball, only relying on high passes, so the Shanghai team intercepted the entire offensive route.</p>
<p>Little Huangmao Has a Way Out</p>
<p>The best performer for the Shanghai team was Zhang Banglun, who saved Li Zhaorong's penalty kick and Feng Jingxiang's two dangerous shots, maintaining the Shanghai team's advantage. Fei Chunhua had a super-level performance. Han Longhai joined the forwards, giving Robert Stoff a way out. The Chinese Selection team lost due to improper strategic use and players underperforming.</p>
<p>At the start of the match, the Chinese Selection team pressed forward and attacked the Shanghai goal for ten minutes before seeing the Shanghai team counterattack. During this scramble, Hou Rongsheng committed a foul in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. "Lazy Bull" Li Yichen kicked the ball high, and the Chinese Selection team escaped disaster. They then switched to offense, and Feng Jingxiang's shot was unable to break through.</p>
<p>Fei Chunhua Particularly Determined</p>
<p>After twenty minutes, Fei Chunhua rushed in, and Xie Jinhong intercepted diagonally. "Little Fei" kicked, Jun'gan caught the ball, but Robert Stoff rushed forward and touched it, and the ball rolled into the net. The Hong Kong team conceded the first goal. After that, the Chinese Selection team tried hard to reverse the situation. Once, Li Shuoyou took a corner kick, and Banglun slapped the ball. Feng Jingxiang was lying behind and headed the ball, but it unfortunately hit the post and went wide. The Chinese Selection team had to be at a disadvantage in the first half.</p>
<p>Switching sides, both teams played steadily. After fourteen minutes, the Shanghai Selection team suddenly launched a rapid attack. Li Yao got the ball at the baseline and quickly crossed it in front of the goal. Robert Stoff made a feint, and Chunhua cleverly rushed forward and headed the ball into the net, 2-0. The Chinese Selection team suffered a blow. Feng Jingxiang fought hard, making one quick shot and one high cross, both saved by Banglun. After twenty minutes, Qixiang was penalized with a penalty kick. Zhaorong kicked it too lightly and was saved by Banglun. Until the thirty-second minute, Jinhe passed the ball diagonally to Jingxiang, who hooked the ball into the net from a dead angle, 2-1. The Chinese Selection team was ultimately unable to reverse the situation and lost by one goal again.</p>

<h3 id="e127">A Major Fiscal Measure in France: The Devaluation of the Franc <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Paris Correspondent, Yi Ruo</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>"The franc is going to be devalued," was the general feeling among Parisians for more than two months. The government first denied the rumors, then remained silent, and finally sent high-ranking officials to England and Washington to negotiate for "public support." At this time, the Paris stock exchange became active, and various stocks, especially foreign stocks, were heavily traded. On the 18th of this month, 130,000 shares were traded, a volume not seen in the past year. All political parties raised the banner of "preventing devaluation," claiming to be the protectors of the national currency, and stabilizing public sentiment was set as a national policy by those seeking to form a cabinet. Last night, Finance Minister Mayer specially invited representatives from Parisian newspapers and foreign press correspondents to his office, where he announced the devaluation of the franc: The exchange rate for the British pound would be 864 francs from the 26th of this month, and the US dollar would be 214 francs, these being the official rates; the market rate could still fluctuate. Parisians then realized that the news published in the Paris Evening News on November 7 of last year was accurate. The government denied the rumors but then admitted them themselves, but who cares about this unclear right and wrong? Everyone just goes on living. In the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 26th, the Prime Minister proclaimed that "preparations began in September of last year, when I was Minister of Finance"! Everyone was surprised.</p>
<p>This devaluation is the third since the war, in just three and a half years. Compared to the franc's predecessor, the Livre tournois, which circulated for eighty or ninety years (1710 to 1802) and was as stable as iron, it is truly incomparable. Even compared to the gold franc before the last World War, which was in use for one hundred and eleven years (from March 28, 1803 to August 1, 1914) without changing in quality or quantity, one cannot help but sigh at the decline of morals and the degradation of the times. What is the reason for this? The first devaluation after the war was appropriate for France to recover its old lands, and the military operations had not yet ended. In the autumn of 1944, the franc was temporarily fixed at "50 to 1 against the US dollar" and "200 to 1" against the British pound. When the military operations ended, foreign trade urgently needed to be organized, so a second devaluation was carried out at the end of December 1945, based on the actual value, changing the rate to 120 francs to one US dollar and 480 francs to one British pound. However, the operation was not thorough enough, commerce did not flow smoothly, and American aid and barter were not satisfactory, so there was this third devaluation.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>This devaluation has cost the authorities a great deal of effort: repeatedly concealing it internally and employing all sorts of tricks externally. On November 7 of last year, the Paris Evening News said that the franc would be devalued. The next day, Finance Minister Schuman said: "The newspaper has infringed upon the dignity of the nation's finances," and sued in court, but nothing was heard of it afterward. On January 13 of this year, when the French parliament was in the midst of a heated election of the speaker, Economic Undersecretary Arlaud suddenly went to London, reportedly to discuss the reconvening of the Sixteen Nations Economic Conference, which was concluded the next day. Immediately after, French Minister of Economy and Finance Mayer followed, talking for three days without result, and returning to Paris on the 18th. At this time, financial expert Mendès France flew from Paris to Washington to discuss with the director of the International Monetary Fund, clarifying the "new foreign exchange value" of the franc: 250 francs to one US dollar, while maintaining the original price of 120 francs domestically, obtaining the Fund's approval. Unexpectedly, the next day (the 19th), the French government changed its mind, simply changing to the new value both domestically and internationally, and anyone who was dissatisfied could argue about it on the market. The Fund didn't mind, as it would facilitate the implementation of the Marshall Plan. The British were greatly displeased and immediately opposed it, this being the event of the 21st, so Mendès France, who had intended to return in triumph, received orders on the 22nd to postpone it. British Economic Undersecretary Sir Edmund Hall-Patch traveled swiftly to France, telling the French government, "This cannot be allowed!" Mayer was stunned. Hall-Patch immediately added: "If the agreement is cancelled, Britain will quadruple the supply of coal to France daily!" (25,000 tons!)</p>
<p>The French government saw that it could not devalue its currency on its own, so it consulted with its allies, Britain and the United States, but they had different opinions and seemed to be not of one mind. Prime Minister Schuman immediately convened Mayer, Bidault, Arlaud, and the governor of the Bank of France, Monick, on the evening of the 22nd to discuss countermeasures against Britain, and convened a cabinet meeting overnight, deciding not to follow British advice. However, the American International Monetary Fund was still undecided, and the French financial expert hesitated to proceed, as the Fund also opposed it, believing that France's unilateral devaluation would affect the future of international finance.</p>
<p>Finally, the last stage arrived. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Stafford Cripps suddenly flew to Paris and met with Schuman and Mayer. The next morning (the 24th) at 9:30, financial experts from both Britain and France gathered at the French Foreign Ministry for discussions. At 11:30, the experts participated in a meeting of economic undersecretaries and the British ambassador. At 12:30, a French cabinet meeting was held. At 2:30 PM, Bidault met with the British ambassador. Cripps left Paris at 4:40 PM and arrived in England at 6:30 PM, refusing any interviews. Some said that the progress of the Anglo-French negotiations and the International Monetary Fund's opinion on French policy could be announced at midnight. When midnight arrived, the cabinet spokesman said that it would have to wait until 7:00 PM on the 25th to be released simultaneously in Paris and Washington, and another night was wasted. At 10:00 AM on the 25th, the French side and the International Monetary Fund were still constantly consulting. The British economic undersecretary, seeing that there was nothing to say, led a second secretary from the British Treasury back to England at 2:30 PM, so that Mayer could quietly address the journalists at 7:00 PM and release the financial policy.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Originally, the devaluation of the franc was not so simple, nor was it directed solely at the US dollar and the British pound. First, although its new value was uniform domestically and internationally, it still carried the label of "official price." In addition, from the 29th, the market price could be obtained in the stock exchange according to the law of supply and demand (which is actually open financial speculation), freely rising and falling, so the franc had not yet escaped the "dual" price. No wonder Mayer said, "The current situation is still temporary." Second, its new value, in addition to devaluing itself by 80% against the British pound and the US dollar, was similarly self-deprecating against the currencies of other countries, such as the Canadian dollar, the Swiss franc, the Indian rupee, etc., rising with the US dollar, and even the Hong Kong dollar was set at 54 francs. Only the Chinese legal currency was ignored. Even within French territory, the value of the franc was not consistent. The French mainland had one price, as mentioned above. The territories of North Africa, South Africa, Oceania, and Central America, the Indian dependencies, and Annam under French control each had their own monetary system, some called francs, some called rupees, some called piastres, with different exchange rates. Some followed the devaluation of the French franc in the home country, such as Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Guyana, Antilles, etc.; some set new values to maintain the original value, such as those that formerly exchanged one French Indian rupee for 36 francs, now requiring 64 francs and 80 centimes; or set new values, further devaluing the local currency, such as in the Oceanic territories: New Caledonia, New Hebrides, etc., which originally exchanged one old French franc for two local francs and forty centimes, now requiring four local francs and thirty-two centimes to exchange for one new French franc after devaluation, is this not a double devaluation? Even the Vietnamese piastre (worth 17 francs) and the currencies of the South African territories, Reunion Island, Saint Pierre and Miquelon (worth one franc and seventy centimes), which maintained the "original parity," had actually fallen. No wonder the King of Morocco wrote to the French President, reportedly related to the local currency value; overseas parliamentarians questioned Prime Minister Schuman, believing that such collateral damage was arbitrary, and Schuman reluctantly agreed to discuss it further.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>After the decree was published, the internal situation was as follows:</p>
<p>In the foreign market, based on the difference between the US dollar group and the British pound group, there were two phenomena. After the franc was devalued, the value of domestic exports was invisibly reduced by 80%, which could be sold smoothly without hindrance. However, the goods of the US dollar group are abundant, and there is no need for French products, and they also implement a tariff barrier policy, so it is a one-sided infatuation dream; no one firmly opposes it, nor enthusiastically approves it, unless they harbor nostalgia for Parisian perfume! Only a few dutiful officials of the International Monetary Fund, holding the articles, insist that it is illegal, and are deeply concerned that other countries will follow suit and dismantle the Fund's platform. In the countries of the British pound group, the dumping of French goods is imminent, plus the Paris exchange will soon open the buying and selling of gold and foreign currency (temporarily excluding the Portuguese escudo and the Portuguese real), the false price of the British pound will return from the officially set four dollars and three cents to the actual price of two dollars and eighty cents, which is no different from a threat to the British pound, a fatal blow, so the British ministers did not spare the labor of crossing the strait to come to Paris to prevent the devaluation of the franc, wasting a few days of abusive talk. Sure enough, on the day of the devaluation, the various stocks on the London Stock Exchange immediately fell by more than 20%, which is a clear proof; it is said that the countries of the British pound group will adopt a protectionist policy to deal with it, so the prospects for French exports are not optimistic.</p>
<p>Domestically, there is even more confusion and no consensus. First, look at the political parties: the most right-wing Republican Freedom Party, the most left-wing Communist Party, the Gaullist Party, and the Agrarian Party are firmly opposed. Even the Socialist Party revealed this intention, because it is an unpopular measure, initiated by Schuman of the Popular Republican Movement and implemented by Mayer, a member of the Radical-Socialist Party of free economic policies. In less than two months since Mayer took over both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy at the end of last November, he successively implemented: (1) a new fiscal plan, including new tax rules and compulsory public bonds, special donations, etc.; (2) devaluation of the franc; (3) free buying and selling of gold and foreign currency; (4) cancellation of the 5,000 franc banknote; (5) ... Each item has undergone fierce debates in the National Assembly. Sometimes they argue irreconcilably, and they have to be decided by "confidence" votes. It is rare to obtain a calm and rational majority. The General Confederation of Labor, the Catholic Confederation of Labor, and the New General Confederation of Labor (which evolved from the General Confederation of Labor) all stand in opposition. The general public is even more at a loss. Schuman said that only in this way can the French economy be revitalized!</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>At this time, the Ministry of Finance ordered at 2:00 AM on the 29th of this month: the 5,000 franc banknote is invalid from today, and merchants must not accept it again. This bolt from the blue immediately alarmed 40 million French people, and all newspapers published special editions. Immediately, many Yan Song-style beggars wandered the streets, their pockets full of 5,000 franc banknotes, unable to buy a loaf of bread; the VIPs of major hotels wanted to borrow a thousand or two thousand francs from the front desk, but the boss replied: "Room and board can be credited temporarily, but please don't ask for petty expenses!" A black market with a 30% discount immediately appeared in the market, each banknote worth only 3,500 francs. The same day's exchange rate in Algiers, North Africa, was only 3,200 francs. All banks across the country simultaneously closed for two days according to the order, suspending exchanges, and reopening only after the National Assembly voted on the measures. According to the banknotes circulating in the market, there are a total of 330 billion francs, accounting for more than one-third of the total currency.</p>
<p>The National Assembly immediately discussed the issue of the withdrawal of banknotes, debating hotly, until 4:30 AM this morning, passing the government proposal with only 307 votes to 286; the exchange procedures will be stipulated by separate legislation. As for the free buying and selling of gold and foreign currency, it remains to be decided by the National Assembly today or tomorrow, which is a major item in financial issues.</p>
<p>From the devaluation of the franc to the withdrawal of banknotes, it is a new phenomenon in French finance, alarming European and American countries (Paris, January 30)</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Atom Smasher <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>The atom smasher (Cyclotron) is of great merit to the brilliant achievements and rapid progress of atomic physics today. There is no consistent translation of its name in our country. It is often translated as "Harmonic Revolving Machine", "Rotary Accelerator", "Cyclic Energy Booster" and "Atom Splitter" in newspapers and magazines. In advanced scientific publications, it is referred to as "Magnetoelectric Accelerator". For the sake of popularity and easy understanding, we still use "Atom Smasher". Its appearance has not only opened a new era for modern physical research, but also has great influence on chemistry, biology and medicine. Its inventor is Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence, a professor at the University of California in the United States. In order to reward his great contribution, the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to him, and since then the research center of the atomic nucleus was transferred from Cambridge University in England and the Academy of Sciences in Germany to the United States. The mystery of this tool has been maintained for a long time before it was revealed.</p>
<p>Principle</p>
<p>Before introducing its entire content, let’s talk about its principle of generation. According to the experiments and inferences of Bohr (N. Bohr) and Wheeler (J. A. Wheeler), all chemical elements except silver are in the so-called "metastable state". Regardless of the process of fusion (the combination of two light elemental nuclei into one) or fission (the splitting of one heavy elemental nucleus into two), an astonishing amount of stored energy is released. Therefore, a scientist said that we live in a terrible gunpowder depot, which is not an exaggeration. Imagine that once these tiny atomic nuclei split and explode, wouldn’t they be atomic bombs? But why don't they have atomic nuclear fission or fusion? This still requires sufficient activation energy to be given to the atomic nucleus. For example, if the atomic nuclei of two light elements approach each other, they will fuse, but when they approach to a certain distance, they will be separated by the mutual repulsion of their own positive charges. Similarly, the atomic nucleus of a heavy element must be subjected to extremely violent impacts before it can split. In fact, there will never be such a strong thing to impact it normally. We must artificially think of ways to increase the activation energy of a projectile before going to the inside of the atomic nucleus to give it a fatal blow before it can split.</p>
<p>With sufficient activation energy to impact an atomic nucleus, the situation is not simple, and many difficulties must be overcome along the way. The barrier surrounding the atomic nucleus is a repulsive force like a wall. When a proton (a small particle with a positive charge) rushes near the atomic nucleus with sufficient energy, it is first resisted by this repulsive force. Unless it advances to a certain close distance to receive the attraction of cohesive force, it will be repelled and defeated. Therefore, we must think of ways to give this charging proton a high speed, so that it can rush to the distance where it can receive the cohesive force in one go. Giving the proton a very large initial energy is the so-called sufficient activation energy.</p>
<p>In addition, according to quantum theory, the resonance phenomenon is important and necessary when impacting the atomic nucleus. Here, resonance refers to the energy of the impacting projectile being equal to the resonant energy of the impacted atomic nucleus. Therefore, whether the proton rushes too fast or too slow reduces the chance of collision. Only at the "appropriate" speed is it almost every collision will split. Based on this principle, the Alpha particles released by various radioactive substances in the decay process were first used as projectiles to impact atomic nuclei, but due to the difficulty in obtaining radioactive substances, scientists wanted to use charged particles (such as protons) to fill this errand. As long as the protons in the strengthened field are accelerated, they can be used to impact. The first to use this principle was Cockroft and Walton of Cambridge University in England, who designed the atomic accelerator (Atomic accelerator or atom-smasher) in 1932. The equipment is simple, and the highest voltage is one million volts, using ordinary capacitors, but it is not much better than Alpha points. Later, Professor Robert L. Van de Graaff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States also completed the electrostatic generator. He used a simplest principle: "Charge is transmitted on a sphere and immediately spread on its surface" to increase the voltage to three or four million volts; and give the proton several energies. (One Crocodile is one million electron volts, abbreviated MeV. The meaning of this energy unit is the transmission of energy to a particle that has been accelerated in an electric field of one million volts and carries a unit charge, which is equal to 1.6 times of the micro-erg, the energy unit we usually use.)</p>
<p>Structure</p>
<p>Using this principle, the most ingenious design is still Dr. Lawrence’s atom smasher, which does not require very high voltage like an electrostatic generator. When a charged particle moves in a uniform magnetic field, its direction of motion is affected by the magnetic field lines, and the straight-line motion is changed to circular motion. The radius of the circle depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the initial velocity of the particle. The faster the motion, the smaller the deflection, and the larger the circle. Based on this fact, he built a very large vacuum chamber, with a flat brass box in the middle divided into two semicircular vacuum chambers with insulators. The two vacuum chambers are respectively connected to an AC motor with a terminal voltage of 20,000 volts and 20 million cycles per second. In this way, in each very short period of time, the two semicircular vacuum chambers are charged with opposite charges and have a potential difference of 20,000 volts. Generally speaking, the two semicircular chambers are always alternately charged eleven; one ten; eleven; .... Outside the vacuum chamber there is a large and strong electromagnetic field, a charged plate connected to a DC motor with a terminal voltage of 100,000 volts and a target.</p>
<p>When a group of protons are introduced into this vacuum chamber, they will be repelled by the positive charge in chamber A and attracted by the negative charge in chamber B, so that the group of protons enter chamber B from chamber A, and then the deflection effect of the electromagnetic field causes the protons to move in a circular arc. Up to chamber B, due to one cycle of the alternating current, chamber B is ten, chamber A is one, and the protons are forced to enter chamber A in a circular arc again. This strengthens its speed time and time again, and the radius of the circle also increases time and time again, making the protons rotate spirally in the vacuum chamber. Finally, when the radius of the unwinding spiral orbit becomes equal to the radius of the chamber, the proton beam is emitted through the small window. Due to the existence of the charged plate, the high-speed proton group is forced to accurately impact the target along a certain orbit. The element to be impacted is placed on the target. If uranium-235 is placed on the target, its atomic nucleus will be impacted and split, and this splitting will continue, which is the so-called chain reaction (Chain of reaction).</p>
<p>The first atom smasher he built is now very small. The two poles of the electromagnet are only 37 inches in diameter and weigh 85 tons. The second one is 64 inches in diameter and weighs 200 tons, and can generate proton beams with energy of 25 crocodiles. Recently, Dr. Lawrence has completed another one weighing 4,000 tons called "Synchro-cyclotron"), and the greatness of its activation energy to protons can be imagined.</p>
<p>Application and Improvement</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the atomic nucleus is the heart of the atom. Its surroundings are wrapped in the envelope of electrons. A proton that rushes into the envelope may lose its direction and fail to accurately collide with the atomic nucleus itself, and in order to overcome the barrier, it loses a part of its energy. Therefore, there is very little chance that a group of protons will collide with the atomic nucleus while their speed is still strong. It is possible that only one out of thousands of protons will complete its mission. This is a bit of a loss. Therefore, in practice, there is not much hope of using artificially accelerated charged particles to impact atomic nuclei and release great stored energy.</p>
<p>In order to remedy this shortcoming, there are two ways to generate atomic fission on a large scale: one is to heat a mixture of a target and a projectile to a very high temperature and cause strong mutual collisions to promote fission. One is to use neutrons instead of protons as impacting projectiles. The latter has been adopted, using the so-called "Neutron-multiplication" to make it the most ideal projectile. Let's put these tables aside for now.</p>
<p>The importance of the atom smasher is as mentioned above, but unfortunately China does not yet have one. According to statistics, in the fall of 1941, there were more than 120 seats distributed in the laboratories of various famous universities in the United States, three in the United Kingdom, one in the Soviet Union, one in France, one in Canada, one in Denmark, and one in Japan. After the victory, it was reported that Japan had also designed two by itself, but they were all ordered to be demolished by the US military.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Dr. Wang Pu of Fu Jen Catholic University in Peiping also made outstanding contributions to atomic nuclear physics, that is, he and RB. Roberts and R. C. Meyer used an atom smasher to impact potassium targets in the Carnegie Institute in the United States and discovered the most important "Delayed neytron" phenomenon. This shows that as long as Chinese scientists have tools and environment, they will surely have many brilliant achievements. In addition, the discovery of Qian Sanqiang and his wife in Paris is also commendable. The Peiping Research Institute plans to change the Radium Research Institute into the Atomic Research Institute, and wants to build an atomic building in Peiping East Imperial City, specializing in the research of atomic physics, which are all good news for the scientific community. We hope that the government will give more funding and make some achievements as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Method of Making Blueprints <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Suisheng</p>
<p>Blueprints are commonly used in construction, statistics, and contracts. What are the medicines, procedures, and principles used in making blueprints? I believe this is what readers are eager to know. Therefore, based on my years of experience in the chemistry laboratory, I will describe it in detail as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Preparation of Blueprint Paper　Although there are several kinds of medicines used in preparing blueprint paper, the following two medicines are usually used:</p>
<p>1.  Ammonium ferric citrate; 2. Red prussiate of potash.</p>
<p>The method is to put 1.5 grams of ammonium ferric citrate into 10 cubic meters of warm water, stir thoroughly to dissolve it, and call it solution A; then take 2 grams of red prussiate of potash, also dissolve it in 10 cubic meters of warm water, stir thoroughly to dissolve it completely, and call it solution B. Mix solutions A and B in a dark room or under red light, and stir more to ensure that they are mixed evenly. Then, take a sponge or cotton, soak it in the mixed solution, and apply it to the drawing paper, making it bright yellow. Still place it in a dark room and let it dry in the shade, then store it properly, do not expose it to light, and keep it for later use.</p>
<p>(2) Blueprint Printing Procedure　First, use a pen and ink to draw a table or calligraphy on a glass plate or tracing paper for later use. Then take the photographic frame, turn it upside down on the table, remove the wooden board and photo, and leave the glass. Then, place the glass plate or tracing paper with the diagram or calligraphy upside down on the original glass; then place the blueprint paper upside down on the tracing paper; then cover it with a wooden board and press it tightly with a sheath. Then, hold the photographic frame and move it into the sunlight, so that the sunlight shines directly on the front for about five to ten minutes, depending on the intensity of the sunlight. But see the yellow blueprint paper gradually changing color, eventually appearing gray with a brownish color. Take out the blueprint paper, and you will see that the original ink marks are still yellow where they are covered. Place it in clean water and wash for a few minutes, and you will have a blueprint with a blue background and white patterns or calligraphy. According to personal experience, the longer the immersion time in water, the clearer it is. If you want to deepen the blue color, you should add salt water or hydrochloric acid to the clean water.</p>
<p>(3) Blueprint Correction Method　If you draw more dots on the tracing paper, the printed blueprint will have more white dots. To correct it, simply apply a mixture of ammonium ferric citrate and red prussiate of potash, expose it to sunlight, and then wash it. If you draw fewer dots on the tracing paper, the printed blueprint will lack dots. You can use alkaline solutions such as baking soda (NaHCO3) water, or washing soda (Na2CO3．IOH2O) solution, or caustic soda solution, or even soapy water as ink, to add the missing dots, and the blue color will fade away and appear as white spots.</p>
<p>(4) The Principle of Blueprint Generation　In our chemical experiments, we usually produce two kinds of blue precipitates: one is called Prussian blue, scientifically known as ferrous ferricyanide (Fe4〔Fe（CN）6〕3); the other is called Turnbull's blue, scientifically known as 化 (Fe3〔Fe（CN）6〕2). The former is produced by adding yellow prussiate of potash (also known as potassium ferrocyanide, K4Fe(CN)6) solution to a ferric salt such as ferric trichloride (FeCl3) or ferric sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3) solution; the latter is produced by combining a ferrous salt such as green vitriol (FeSO4·7H2O) also known as ferrous sulfate solution, with red prussiate of potash (also known as potassium ferricyanide, K3Fe(CN)6) solution. However, if the ferric salt and ferrous salt are interchanged, no blue precipitate can be obtained. For example, if the ferric salt solution is mixed with the red prussiate of potash solution, no blue precipitate will occur. The principle of blue circle formation is based on this: because ammonium ferric citrate is a ferric salt, it does not change when mixed with red prussiate of potash solution, and it remains unchanged when applied to paper without light; but when exposed to sunlight, the ferric salt is gradually reduced to a ferrous salt, and Turnbull's blue occurs with red prussiate of potash. However, where the ink marks are covered, the light cannot pass through, so no change occurs. After being washed with water, it flows away with the water, so it remains white.</p>
<p>If readers have considerable experience, they can proceed to print photos, that is, replace the tracing paper with calligraphy with a photographic negative, and print, wash, and dry it according to the law, and you can succeed. Also, the made blueprint paper is best used within a few days; if it takes more than half a month, there is a risk of failure, which should be noted.</p>
<p>(Note) (1) Ammonium ferric citrate: It is a dark reddish-brown transparent crystal, deliquescent, and deteriorates when exposed to light. It is usually tightly packed in colored bottles. It is easily soluble in water. Commercially available blood tonics often contain this type of organic iron salt. The molecular formula is (NH4)3FeC(6H5O7)2, which is made by adding citric acid H3．C6H5O7) to ferric hydroxide Fe(OH)3), and then adding ammonia water (NH4OH).</p>
<p>(2) Red prussiate of potash: It is a bright red, lustrous crystal, easily soluble in water, and highly toxic. It can be made by passing chlorine into yellow prussiate of potash solution: Cl2+2K4Fe(CN)6—2K3Fe(CN)6+3KCl．</p>
<h3 id="e131">Alchemy <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changqing</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone has read the stories of "turning iron into gold" or "turning stone into gold", but when you see it in the newspaper now, it is no longer a story but a fact.</p>
<p>Since atomic research has been advancing rapidly, some people have tried to artificially transform atoms. Last year, a scientist turned lead into gold. Lead is a cheap metal, so what is so rare about gold? But rest assured, the cost of turning an ounce of lead into gold is several times more expensive than real gold!</p>
<p>The gold transformed by this method looks exactly like real gold at first glance, but if you make it into a gold ring and wear it on your hand, although you don't feel hot, your skin will be burned after a few days. It turns out that there are still many protons hidden in the special surface to be released. After this kind of gold is hidden for a year, its protons are completely released, and it will be exactly the same as real gold.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although gold is precious, it has not much use except as decoration and currency. Why don't smart scientists study some methods for making coal, cloth, and rice to relieve the widespread famine in the world!</p>

<p>The atmosphere of gambling in Shanghai has always been very strong, and during the few days of the Lunar New Year, gambling sounds can be heard everywhere. Adults gamble, children also gamble, families become small casinos, and streets and alleys are public casinos. Shanghai in the New Year is almost turned into Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there is a saying that whoring is all empty, gambling is a hedge, eating is enjoyable, and dressing is prestigious. The "hedge" in the saying "gambling is a hedge" is probably a different pronunciation of the word "折" (zhé, fold), meaning that gambling only has a 50% chance, which is slightly better than whoring, but it always contains a 50% risk.</p>
<p>However, the tempting power of gambling probably lies in this 50% risk. Because if gambling is guaranteed to win money, then it should be like the saying "whoring can even pay you back, gambling can win money, is the number one business in the world". Only because gambling cannot guarantee winning money, but has a 50% chance of winning, can people enjoy it and never tire of it, and even squander their family fortunes for it.</p>
<p>People who are addicted to gambling are generally superstitious people. Although they all know that gambling is a labor-intensive and money-wasting activity, and they know that it is a losing game, they still believe that they can grasp the so-called "road". In the stock exchange, there are so-called charting experts, and in large casinos, there are also charting friends, and it is said that they also have so-called "scientific" basis. However, apart from the casino owners, I have never heard of a charting expert who has made a fortune by gambling. On the contrary, I have seen some "蹩脚生" (bé jiǎo shēng, clumsy students) who specialize in charting routes for gamblers. They themselves are victims in the gambling arena, and are failed veterans.</p>
<p>The old Russian writer Dostoevsky, who wrote "The Gambler", was himself a person who was addicted to gambling; in his wife's "Memoirs", she said that Dostoevsky was confident that he had a deep grasp of gambling methods, especially for roulette. But during a period of traveling in Germany, Dostoevsky not only lost all the advance royalties, but even almost ended up stranded in another country. However, throughout his life, he never lost his love for gambling.</p>
<p>A person of such wisdom as Dostoevsky actually deeply believed that there were reliable methods in gambling, which shows how tempting gambling is.</p>
<p>But if we can understand the adventurous nature that humans share, it is not difficult to understand the mysterious attraction of gambling. Humans are inherently gamblers. Human's fighting, war-loving, and competitive characters are all just the character of a gambler. It needs stimulation, it needs venting, and the tools and methods of gambling can just provide this need. So, rather than saying that gambling has a profound attraction, it is better to say that it is because of the weaknesses in people's character, especially in people's social lives.</p>
<p>The spirit of fighting and adventuring may not be said to be a weakness, because the success of many great undertakings often stems from this spiritual motivation. But if the social atmosphere only encourages the spirit of fighting and adventuring in the path of luck, then when people's spirits cannot find proper venting, they will naturally only tend to all the so-called "extracurricular pastimes" and this set of playthings.</p>

<p>— Jun</p>
<p>We all know that vitamins are essential elements for maintaining normal physiological changes in the human body. Lack of vitamins will prevent normal physiological changes from being maintained, and various diseases will occur. For example, lack of vitamin A will cause night blindness and keratosis; lack of vitamin B1 will cause beriberi, neuritis, and acute cardiac weakness; lack of vitamin C will cause scurvy; lack of vitamin D will cause rickets and osteomalacia; lack of vitamin E will cause infertility. In recent years, scientists have discovered many more vitamins, totaling more than thirty.</p>
<p>The popularity of various vitamin products on the market shows that the importance of vitamins has been recognized by the general public.</p>
<p>But, is it harmful to have too many vitamins?</p>
<p>According to recent research results, if the human body takes in too many vitamins, its physiological changes will also be abnormal and cause disease.</p>
<p>It is currently known that excessive amounts of vitamins A and D can cause poisoning. The former causes symptoms such as nausea, headache, vomiting, sluggishness, and drowsiness, while the latter increases the amount of calcium in the blood, resulting in decreased sensitivity of muscles and nerves, and can also cause serious consequences such as calcification of the kidneys, myocardium, and blood vessels. According to animal experiments, vitamin B1 is also toxic, it can dilate peripheral blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and paralyze the respiratory center of the medulla oblongata, causing difficulty breathing, and even death, but how toxic it is to humans remains to be studied.</p>
<p>Too much is as bad as too little, and vitamins are no exception.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 14th), the Shanghai painters held a "Spring Festival Reunion" at Guanshengyuan. I happened to be fortunate enough to attend. In these times of turmoil and chaos, I couldn't help but feel touched. Upon returning, I spread out the paper and painted bamboo, and inscribed a quatrain. I would like to take this opportunity to wish for world peace.</p>
<p>After the disaster, the cold jade shadow is blurred,</p>
<p>The strong green is better than nothing,</p>
<p>Trying my brush for the first time to wish for peace,</p>
<p>The picture of bamboo in my heart is in it.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Lighting Candles at Guangjue Temple <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>On New Year's Eve, I went to the City God Temple. It was too crowded, so I sat down in the Donglou Teahouse in the right wing. From the window, I looked at the front of the City God's altar. On several rows of candlesticks, small red candles were constantly being lit and inserted, blown out and pulled out, and then thrown into the large bamboo basket on the side. The head monk was smiling, counting his considerable income for this year and this night, perhaps he had already contracted tens of thousands of pounds of candle oil to that candle shop. The temple was so busy that his face was oily, and his whole body was like a candle. He also seemed to be happy tonight, and could get some incense money. The devout men and women did not care how many seconds their incense offerings to the gods lasted. They looked up, raised their hands, and held up the red candles and sent them upward. They were all solemnly thanking the gods for protecting them this year; and they were also sincerely praying that they would still rely on the gods for protection in the coming year. This is not superstition - the object of everyone's faith may be the everlasting symbol of loving the people like children represented by the mud and wood statues.</p>
<p>Around midnight, there were two drumbeats in front of the hall, who was the first to offer incense? There were more and more people, the light of the candles became brighter and brighter, and the smoke of the incense became thicker and thicker.</p>
<p>When I got home, it was almost dawn. My wife bought a pair of gold-lettered red candles, which were shining brightly on the table. Next to them were wintersweet flowers, and the petals looked transparent and beautiful when viewed through the candlelight. The candlelight, as if teasing them intentionally, exuded bursts of fragrance. People feel that some old things are really indispensable: the firecrackers outside the door, the distant gongs and cymbals, are all indispensable; this pair of tall red candles in front of people and flowers is even more indispensable.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Three Heroes of Hubei <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Beijing had the reputation of the Three Heroes of Hubei. The three heroes were President Li Yuanhong, Opera King Tan Xinpei, and Xiaofeng, a famous courtesan from Shaanxi Lane. All three were natives of 鄂 (È, Hubei), hence the name.</p>
<p>Before the Republic of China, my family lived in Tanhualin, Wuchang. Li was the Association Commander (协统, xié tǒng), and his uncle, Mr. Wang Ping, became sworn brothers with my father, and the two families had contact. After the establishment of the Republic of China, my family moved to Shanghai. Li was the Governor of Hubei and was also elected as the Vice President. Li read my translated "Two Years in the Qing Palace" and praised it. He asked Song Dunfu to write a letter to my father, wanting to recruit me into the Governor's Office to work in the foreign affairs department, but I did not go due to illness. Li's character, although not a great talent, but his refusal to accept Yuan Shikai's title of Prince Wuyi and his refusal to Duan Qirui's order to dissolve the parliament, his integrity was not easy, and he has his own place in the history of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Tan Xinpei was from Shahu, outside the Xiaodongmen in Wuchang. In his early years, he and his father fled famine to Beijing. He first studied martial arts and then changed to singing old male roles (鬚生, xū shēng). His fame rose sharply. His singing of the play "Selling Horses" (賣馬, mài mǎ) could express the state of a hero's frustration and boredom to the fullest extent. He was known as the natural Qin Shubao. He entered the inner court as a court actor and had the name Tan Beile (谭贝勒, Tán Bèi lè). One year, there was a flood in Hubei, and my brother asked him to give a charity performance to help the disaster relief, which he happily agreed to, and he also donated hundreds of taels of small silver ingots that the Empress Dowager had rewarded him over the years to help the disaster relief. During the transition between the Guangxu and Xuantong reigns, Tan performed opera in Zhongheyuan. Those who accompanied him were the famous female role singer Wang Yaoqing and the famous clown Wang Changlin. The price of the play was 1,600 copper coins per person, which was only 160 copper coins in southern currency. My brothers and friends often listened to operas. The painter Liu Baochen from the same hometown suggested that we were "obsessed with Tan" (痰迷心竅, Tán mí xīn qiào). One day, Tan performed "Heavenly Thunder Retribution" (天雷報, Tiān Léi Bào). We strongly pulled Liu Baochen to watch it. When it came to the most intense part of Qingfeng Pavilion, Sai Chen couldn't help but shed tears, which shows how deeply Tan's play moved people. People in Shanghai only know that "Losing the Empty City" (失空斬, Shī Kōng Zhǎn) is Tan's unique skill, but they don't know that his "The Scholar's Score" (狀元譜, zhuàng yuán pǔ) (Visiting the Grave for the Nephew) especially has the beauty of art. Tan would always ask us to watch this play every time he performed it.</p>
<p>Xiaofeng enjoyed a great reputation in the early years of the Republic of China. Her appearance was not very beautiful. Several years later, around the tenth year of the Republic of China, my brother Cai Ziyu and I went to Yangtaishan to see the apricot blossoms and stayed in Shuangfeng Temple. One morning, the two of us sat in rattan sedan chairs to Dajue Temple. The apricot blossoms were all over the forest along the way, like peppercorns and beans, or red breaking through white dew. The morning sun shone on them, and the light was extremely beautiful. There were two magnolia trees in Tianjue Temple, as high as the eaves. The flowers were the most famous. When we went, the flowers had bloomed eight or nine points. While wandering in the courtyard, we met Fu Yuanshu and Bai Lizhai. They invited us into the room to eat porridge. We saw Wang Kemin as the host. The table was lined with ham, meat floss, preserved eggs and other porridge dishes, as well as two large plates of Gaozhuang steamed buns. A woman came out of the inner room to greet us. She seemed familiar. We said goodbye and left. Bai Lizhai sent us to the temple gate. I privately asked who the hostess was. Lizhai laughed and said, "Don't you even know the famous Xiaofeng?" Some people mistakenly thought that the one who was intimate with Cai E was Xiaofeng, but in fact, the famous courtesan who designed to help Cai leave Beijing and go to Yunnan to launch an uprising was Xiaofengxian. When Cai died overseas, a memorial service was held in the Central Park of Beijing. Xiaofengxian rushed to the spirit and cried bitterly, and personally hung a mourning couplet: "Unfortunately, Zhou Lang died young, I knew Li Jing was a hero." She regarded herself as Hong Fu, which was extremely self-important. Xiaofeng and Xiaofengxian were both famous courtesans, but the people they admired were so different.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Voluntary Sacrifice (71)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai said: "Just on the road, and the boss usually goes everywhere to look for it. I am really worried. At least I have to ask the police on duty if they saw a female guest fall and get injured. Moreover, recently, because the American army has just arrived in Peiping, there are especially many cars coming and going on the road, and they drive especially fast. There are car accidents every day. If there is misfortune, what can I do? I must go out and find it." Seeing that Zhu Zhai was determined to leave, Xiao Wang's mother said, "Mr. Xu, you haven't eaten yet, and the wind is strong outside, and it's very cold. Eat something before you go out!" Zhu Zhai said, "I can't eat. I'll eat again when I find the boss." Saying that, he put on his coat, put on his hat, and left in a hurry. When he came out of the alley, he saw that it was all white. The snow on the ground had already accumulated several inches, and the snowflakes in the air were pouring down on his head. Zhu Zhai braved the cold and snow and walked along the road. After a while, a coat, the entire back of his shoulders, was completely covered with snowflakes. Zhu Zhai walked while observing the ground. Apart from the messy ruts and footprints, there was no one lying on the road. He was very suspicious. Could it be that Qi Wan was hit by a car and injured on the road, and was sent to the hospital, so he couldn't see it. Whenever he saw a policeman on duty on the road, he asked him if anyone had been hit by a car and injured, which made many policemen on duty think that this person was mentally ill. The more Zhu Zhai walked on the road, the more panicked he became. His feet slipped and he fell, getting mud and snow all over his body. He got up and ran forward, ignoring everything. He searched for a long time, but there were no signs. He was so anxious that he almost wanted to cry out. Since he couldn't find her on the main street, he turned into the small alleys and searched again. After several hours of searching, there was still no trace. He thought that he had been out for a long time. Maybe she had already gone home while I was looking for her on the street. With this hope in his heart, he hurried back. When he got home, he pressed the doorbell outside the door and asked Xiao Wang's mother if the boss had returned. Xiao Wang's mother said, "No!" Zhu Zhai didn't say a word when he heard this, and walked into the house with his head down. Seeing that he had been out for a long time, Xiao Wang's mother said, "My lord, how did you get into this situation!" Zhu Zhai shook his head and said, "I searched everywhere and asked many policemen, but no one saw her." Xiao Wang's mother said, "What's the use of asking the police?" Zhu Zhai said, "She's not on the road, nor at the homes of relatives and friends. I'm afraid she was injured by a car on the road and sent to the hospital." Xiao Wang's mother said, "Don't worry, if that really happened, they would send us a letter!" Zhu Zhai said, "Who would send us a letter?" Xiao Wang's mother said, "Why don't you understand? If she's injured and sent to the hospital, the hospital wouldn't send a letter! Everyone knows the boss's name."</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Yu Opera in Lanzhou (Part 2) <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Junzuo</p>
<p>This new Yu opera creator has been dedicated to the reform of Yu opera since 1931. He grew up in the modern Central Plains, the modern China, where there was constant turmoil and endless sorrow. He felt the aggression of strong enemies from the outside, and the darkness of society from the inside. Therefore, in the adapted scripts, he can best meet the trend of the times and the voices of the masses, and he can still promote the advantages of local characteristics. This is his advantage, which is indeed extraordinary. However, Mr. Fan's performance in the past year or two has not been good enough. Although he independently leads the Lion Roar Troupe he formed in Xi'an, unfortunately, until today, I have not seen any new masterpieces from him.</p>
<p>Wang Jingyun is one of his proudest disciples. This female performer, who was very popular in Lanzhou, is only about eighteen or nineteen years old. Song Shuyun is best at performing tragedies. She sings countless tears in "Selling Horses" and "Pipa Record", and her age is gradually increasing, and her family burden is very heavy. The regret is that the two of them are too unharmonious. This kind of jealousy of old-fashioned actors should no longer exist. There is also a Li Lanju who is also quite popular. They all compete to be the leading actress and sing the final show. They used to make a mess of it. After the change to New Light, although it is not a military management, it is still a bit of a public atmosphere, and the atmosphere between the three popular actresses is not as tense as before.</p>
<p>In addition to these few people, there are also three very good roles: a martial arts actor, an old male role, and a clown. In this way, the team is considered complete. Cultural workers in Lanzhou who love Yu opera are planning to launch this Yu opera reform movement, inviting Fan Cuiting to Lanzhou to write and direct several brand-new scripts to meet the requirements of wartime national construction. The reform of Yu opera, that is, the creation of new Yu opera, is nothing more than starting from the script, props, acting skills, singing, scene, music, lighting, and actors. For example, Yu opera used to have quite a few instruments, such as the soft-bow erhu, hard-bow erhu, moon lute, three-stringed lute, and four-stringed lute. In recent years, because the voices of the actors are too low, it has been reduced to the least possible number. However, when Yu opera queen Chen Suzhen performs, she must add four or five erhus or other stringed instruments. If she can also adopt the strengths of Qin opera and Peking opera music, it will not be as monotonous and tasteless as listening to Yu opera music today. This is a key point that Yu opera must reform.</p>
<p>I remember last winter in Shanghai, I talked to Mr. Pan Gongzhan about the literary revolution movement. Mr. Gongzhan repeatedly emphasized the necessity of reforming local operas to modernize, popularize, and artisticize them. Unfortunately, Mr. Gongzhan could not come to Lanzhou to see the Henan opera, that is, Yu opera, that I introduced. I think Mr. Gongzhan would definitely praise it and think it has reform value. I think Mr. Gongzhan would definitely appreciate Wang Jingyun's youth and beauty and Song Shuyun's deep performance. If possible, the New Light Troupe in Lanzhou is very willing to go to Shanghai for a performance and seek advice. According to my thoughts, the audience's reaction will definitely not be lower than watching the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, right? (March 7, 1938, sent from Lanzhou)</p>
